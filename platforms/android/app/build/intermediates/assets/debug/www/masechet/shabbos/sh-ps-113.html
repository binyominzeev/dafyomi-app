<p class="bas subject"><span class="nm">1)</span>DECREES ON ACCOUNT OF TYING</p>
<p class="bas indent1"><span class="nm">(a)</span><span class="cl">(Mishnah):</span> One may tie a belt on a bucket [to hang it over a pit, for one will not Mevatel it], one may not tie it with a rope;</p>
<p class="bas indent1"><span class="nm">(b)</span>R. Yehudah permits.</p>
<p class="bas indent1"><span class="nm">(c)</span>R. Yehudah says, the general rule is, one is not liable for any knot that is not permanent.</p>
<p class="bas indent1"><span class="nm">(d)</span><span class="cl">(Gemara) Question:</span> What kind of rope is it?</p>
<p class="bas indent2"><span class="nm">1.</span><span class="cl">Suggestion:</span> It is a regular rope.</p>
<p class="bas indent2"><span class="nm">2.</span><span class="cl">Rejection:</span> R. Yehudah would not permit this, it is permanent [he will Mevatel it]!</p>
<p class="bas indent1"><span class="nm">(e)</span><span class="cl">Answer:</span> It is a weaver's rope [he needs it, he will not Mevatel it].</p>
<p class="bas indent1"><span class="nm">(f)</span><span class="cl">Suggestion:</span> Chachamim decree to forbid a weaver's rope on account of a regular rope, R. Yehudah does not decree.</p>
<p class="bas indent1"><span class="nm">(g)</span><span class="cl">Contradiction (Beraisa):</span> If the rope of a bucket broke, one may not tie it, he may make a bow;</p>
<p class="bas indent2"><span class="nm">1.</span>R. Yehudah permits to tie a belt, but not to make a bow (he decrees on account of a knot)!</p>
<p class="bas indent2"><span class="nm">2.</span>R. Yehudah and Chachamim both contradict themselves!</p>
<p class="bas indent1"><span class="nm">(h)</span><span class="cl">Answer - part 1 (for Chachamim):</span> Chachamim forbid a weaver's rope on account of a regular rope, for these can be confused - they do not forbid a bow on account of a knot, people do not confuse them.</p>
<p class="bas indent1"><span class="nm">(i)</span><span class="cl">Answer - part 2 (for R. Yehudah):</span> R. Yehudah does not forbid a bow on account of a knot - rather, he holds that a bow is considered a knot!</p>
<p class="bas indent1"><span class="nm">(j)</span><span class="cl">(R. Aba):</span> One may bring a rope from his house and tie a cow to a feeding trough.</p>
<p class="bas indent1"><span class="nm">(k)</span><span class="cl">Question (R.  Acha bar Papa):</span> If a rope is tied on a feeding trough, one may tie the other end to a cow, and vice-versa;</p>
<p class="bas indent2"><span class="nm">1.</span>One may not bring a rope from his house and tie a cow to a feeding trough.</p>
<p class="bas indent1"><span class="nm">(l)</span><span class="cl">Answer (R. Aba):</span> The Beraisa forbids a regular rope, I permit weaving ropes.</p>
<p class="bas subject"><span class="nm">2)</span>MOVING KELIM USED FOR WEAVING</p>
<p class="bas indent1"><span class="nm">(a)</span><span class="cl">(Rav Yehudah citing Shmuel):</span> On Shabbos, one may move Kelim used for weaving.</p>
<p class="bas indent1"><span class="nm">(b)</span><span class="cl">Question:</span> May one move the upper and lower warp beams?</p>
<p class="bas indent1"><span class="nm">(c)</span>Rav Yehudah could not give a clear answer.</p>
<p class="bas indent1"><span class="nm">(d)</span><span class="cl">(Rav Nachman citing Shmuel):</span> On Shabbos, one may move Kelim used for weaving, even the upper and lower warp beams, but not Amudim (beams of a vertical (women's) loom.</p>
<p class="bas indent1"><span class="nm">(e)</span><span class="cl">Question (Rava):</span> Why are Amudim forbidden?</p>
<p class="bas indent1"><span class="nm">(f)</span><span class="cl">Suggestion:</span> This is because one makes a little hole in the ground when moving them.</p>
<p class="bas indent1"><span class="nm">(g)</span><span class="cl">Objection:</span> The holes come by themselves!</p>
<p class="bas indent2"><span class="nm">1.</span><span class="cl">(Mishnah):</span> If one stores (Ramban - a bunch of) turnips or radishes under a vine, leaving some of the leaves (Rav Hai Gaon - some of them) exposed, we are not concerned for Kil'ai ha'Kerem, Shemitah, or Ma'aser;</p>
<p class="bas indent2"><span class="nm">2.</span>One may remove it on Shabbos (we are not concerned for making a hole)!</p>
<p class="bas indent1"><span class="nm">(h)</span><span class="cl">Answer:</span> In the field one will not even out the holes, in the house one might.</p>
<p class="bas indent1"><span class="nm">(i)</span><span class="cl">Question (R. Yochanan):</span> On Shabbos, may one move Kelim used for weaving, such as the upper and lower warp beams?</p>
<p class="bas indent1"><span class="nm">(j)</span><span class="cl">Answer (R. Yehudah bar Livai):</span> One may not.</p>
<p class="bas indent1"><span class="nm">(k)</span><span class="cl">Question:</span> What is the reason?</p>
<p class="bas indent1"><span class="nm">(l)</span><span class="cl">Answer:</span> This is because they are not normally moved during the week [because they are so heavy, they are exclusively for weaving].</p>
<p class="bas subject"><span class="nm">3)</span>GARMENTS OF SHABBOS</p>
<p class="bas indent1"><span class="nm">(a)</span><span class="cl">(Mishnah):</span> One may fold garments, even four or five times;</p>
<p class="bas indent1"><span class="nm">(b)</span>One may spread bed linens on Shabbos night for the sake of Shabbos day, but not on Shabbos for the sake of Motzei Shabbos;</p>
<p class="bas indent1"><span class="nm">(c)</span>R. Yishmael says, one may fold garments or prepare a bed on Yom Kipur for the sake of Shabbos; Chelev of [Korbanos of] Shabbos may be offered on [the following night, even if it is] Yom Kipur, but Chelev of Yom Kipur may not be offered on [Motzei Yom Kipur if it is] Shabbos;</p>
<p class="bas indent1"><span class="nm">(d)</span>R. Akiva says, Chelev of Shabbos may not be offered on Yom Kipur, nor may Chelev of Yom Kipur be offered on Shabbos.</p>
<p class="bas indent1"><span class="nm">(e)</span><span class="cl">(Gemara - D'vei R. Yanai):</span> One person may fold garments, but two may not [fold together, for it evens out creases, this is like fixing garments];</p>
<p class="bas indent1"><span class="nm">(f)</span>Even one person is permitted only new garments, not old ones;</p>
<p class="bas indent1"><span class="nm">(g)</span>Even new garments are permitted only if they are white, not if they are colored;</p>
<p class="bas indent1"><span class="nm">(h)</span>Even white garments are permitted only if he has nothing else to wear on Shabbos - if not, they are forbidden.</p>
<p class="bas indent1"><span class="nm">(i)</span><span class="cl">(Beraisa):</span> The household of R. Gamliel would not fold white garments because they had others to wear.</p>
<p class="bas indent1"><span class="nm">(j)</span><span class="cl">(Rav Huna):</span> If one an wear different garments on Shabbos than he wore during the week, he should do so;</p>
<p class="bas indent2"><span class="nm">1.</span>If not, he should open the folds of his garments so that they reach lower down [to show that he does not need to do Melachah].</p>
<p class="bas indent1"><span class="nm">(k)</span><span class="cl">Objection (Rav Safra):</span> This looks like haughtiness!</p>
<p class="bas indent1"><span class="nm">(l)</span><span class="cl">Answer:</span> Since he does so only on Shabbos, it does not look like haughtiness.</p>
<p class="bas indent1"><span class="nm">(m)</span>"V'Chibadto" - your clothing on Shabbos should not be like your clothing on a weekday;</p>
<p class="bas indent2"><span class="nm">1.</span>R. Yochanan called his garments 'What honors me'.</p>
<p class="bas subject"><span class="nm">4)</span>DISTINGUISHING SHABBOS FROM A WEEKDAY</p>
<p class="bas indent1"><span class="nm">(a)</span>"Me'Asos Derachecha" - your should not walk on Shabbos the same way you walk on a weekday;</p>
<p class="bas indent1"><span class="nm">(b)</span>"Mi'Mtzo Cheftzecha" - your [business] desires are forbidden, those of Shomayim (e.g. Tzedakah) are permitted;</p>
<p class="bas indent1"><span class="nm">(c)</span>"V'Daber Davar" - your speech on Shabbos should not be like your speech on a weekday (one should not talk idly or discuss business);</p>
<p class="bas bbbline">113b----------------------------------------113b</p>
<p class="bas indent2"><span class="nm">1.</span>"Davar" - speech is forbidden, thoughts are permitted. (Shulchan Aruch - to fulfill Oneg, one should consider that all of his work is finished.)</p>
<p class="bas indent1"><span class="nm">(d)</span><span class="cl">Question:</span> We understand all of these, except for 'you should not walk on Shabbos the same way you walk on a weekday' - how should it be different?</p>
<p class="bas indent1"><span class="nm">(e)</span><span class="cl">Answer #1:</span> Rav Huna taught, if one encounters a stream, if he can leave one foot on the ground and step across, it is permitted [even to jump]; if not, he may not [jump across].</p>
<p class="bas indent1"><span class="nm">(f)</span><span class="cl">Objection (Rava):</span> Should he rather go around? This causes him extra walking! If he will walk through the water, his garments may get soaked and he will come to squeeze out water!</p>
<p class="bas indent2"><span class="nm">1.</span>Rather, since there is no alternative, he may jump across.</p>
<p class="bas indent1"><span class="nm">(g)</span><span class="cl">Answer #2 - Question (Rebbi):</span> May one take a big step (more than one Amah, which is normal) on Shabbos?</p>
<p class="bas indent2"><span class="nm">1.</span><span class="cl">Answer (R. Yishmael b'Rebbi Yosi):</span> One may not even during the week, for it diminishes one part in 500 of his sight; it is restored at Kidush of Shabbos night (by drinking from the wine. Big steps are forbidden on a weekday, just like on Shabbos (except for running to a Mitzvah) - the Gemara does not explicitly say how they are different! Ritva - sight lost for big steps on Shabbos is not returned at Kidush. Maharsha - the difference is, there is also an Isur on Shabbos ("Me'Asos Derachecha"), whereas on a weekday it is forbidden only because it harms sight. Ben Yehoyada - Rebbi only asked [and accepted the answer] regarding Shabbos - Rebbi permits during the week and forbids on Shabbos.)</p>
<p class="bas indent1"><span class="nm">(h)</span><span class="cl">Question (Rebbi):</span> May one eat dirt on Shabbos (is it forbidden on account of healing)?</p>
<p class="bas indent1"><span class="nm">(i)</span><span class="cl">Answer (R. Yishmael b'Rebbi Yosi):</span> It is forbidden even during the week, for it makes one sick.</p>
<p class="bas indent1"><span class="nm">(j)</span><span class="cl">(R. Ami):</span> Eating dirt of Bavel is like eating one's ancestors [that died in the flood].</p>
<p class="bas indent1"><span class="nm">(k)</span>Some say, it is like eating Shekatzim u'Rmashim (vermin that died in the flood) - "Va'Yimach Es Kol ha'Yekum..."</p>
<p class="bas indent1"><span class="nm">(l)</span><span class="cl">(Reish Lakish):</span> Bavel is called "Shin'ar" because all who died in the flood Nin'aru (were shaken) to there;</p>
<p class="bas indent1"><span class="nm">(m)</span><span class="cl">(R. Yochanan):</span> Bavel is called 'Metzulah' (Yeshayah 44:27) because all who died in the flood Nitztalelu (sunk) to there.</p>
<p class="bas indent1"><span class="nm">(n)</span>Some say, it is like eating Shekatzim u'Rmashim.</p>
<p class="bas indent1"><span class="nm">(o)</span><span class="cl">Question:</span> Surely, they dissolved!</p>
<p class="bas indent1"><span class="nm">(p)</span><span class="cl">Answer:</span> Indeed, they did - however, since it is forbidden to eat because it is unhealthy, Chachamim forbade also on account of Shekatzim u'Rmashim.</p>
<p class="bas indent2"><span class="nm">1.</span>A certain man ate clean dirt and cress; it sprouted in his stomach, reached his heart and killed him.</p>
<p class="bas subject"><span class="nm">5)</span>BO'AZ AND RUS</p>
<p class="bas indent1"><span class="nm">(a)</span><span class="cl">(R. Elazar):</span> "V'Rochatzt va'Sacht v'Samt <i>Simlosayich</i>" - this refers to Shabbos clothing.</p>
<p class="bas indent1"><span class="nm">(b)</span><span class="cl">(R. Elazar):</span> "Ten l'Chacham v'Yechkam Od" - this refers to Rus and Shmuel;</p>
<p class="bas indent2"><span class="nm">1.</span>No'omi told Rus to bathe, anoint, put on her Shabbos clothing and go to the granary - Rus went to the granary first (lest people see her adorned and suspect that she is a harlot);</p>
<p class="bas indent2"><span class="nm">2.</span>Eli told Shmuel "... Im Yikra Elecha v'Amarta Daber Hash-m Ki Shome'a Avdecha", but Shmuel omitted "Hash-m" (lest it was not Hash-m, and he would say His name in vain).</p>
<p class="bas indent1"><span class="nm">(c)</span><span class="cl">(R. Elazar):</span> "Va'Telach va'Savo va'Telaket" - Rus kept coming and going until she found proper people to go with;</p>
<p class="bas indent1"><span class="nm">(d)</span><span class="cl">Question:</span> "Va'Yomer Bo'az...l'Mi ha'Na'arah ha'Zos" - did Bo'az normally ask about girls?!</p>
<p class="bas indent1"><span class="nm">(e)</span><span class="cl">Answer #1 (R. Elazar):</span> He saw Chachmah in her - she would take two sheaves (of Leket, i.e. what falls during harvesting), but not three (for three are not considered Leket).</p>
<p class="bas indent1"><span class="nm">(f)</span><span class="cl">Answer #2 (Beraisa):</span> He saw Tzeni'us in her - she would gather attached [Shichchah] while standing, she would sit to pick up from the ground [to avoid bending over].</p>
<p class="bas indent1"><span class="nm">(g)</span><span class="cl">Question:</span> "V'Cho Tidbakun Im Na'arosoi" - did Bo'az normally cling to girls?! (Maharsha - he told her to cling to his girls - nevertheless, since 'Divuk' is usually between man and wife, we expound the word. Bach's text - did Bo'az normally speak with girls?!)</p>
<p class="bas indent1"><span class="nm">(h)</span><span class="cl">Answer (R. Elazar):</span> Because "Va'Tishak Orpah la'Chamosah v'Rus Dovkah Bah", he realized that it is permitted to cling to her (Iyun Yakov - if Rus would be forbidden to Benei Yisrael, No'omi would not have agreed to convert her);</p>
<p class="bas indent1"><span class="nm">(i)</span><span class="cl">(R. Elazar):</span> "Va'Yomer Lah...Goshi Halom" - he hinted to her that Malchus Beis David will descend from her, like it says "...Havi'osani Ad Halom".</p>
<p class="bas indent1"><span class="nm">(j)</span><span class="cl">(R. Elazar):</span> "V'Tovalt Pitech ba'Chometz" - this teaches that vinegar is good in hot weather.</p>
<p class="bas indent1"><span class="nm">(k)</span><span class="cl">(R. Shmuel bar Nachmani):</span> He hinted to her that someone will descend from her whose deeds are as bitter as vinegar, i.e. Menasheh.</p>
<p class="bas indent1"><span class="nm">(l)</span><span class="cl">(R. Elazar):</span> "Va'Teshev mi'Tzad ha'Kotzrim" - to the side, but not amidst the harvesters - he hinted to her that Malchus Beis David will split (10 tribes will be given to Yarov'om).</p>
<p class="bas indent1"><span class="nm">(m)</span><span class="cl">(R. Elazar):</span> "Va'Yitzbat Lah Kali va'Tochal" - "va'Tochal" in the days of David, "Va'Tisba" - in the days of Shlomo; "Va'Tosar" - in the days of Chizkiyah. (Rashi - this refers to the Malchus that will come from her; Maharsha - it refers to herself.)</p>
<p class="bas indent2"><span class="nm">1.</span>Some say, "va'Tochal" in the days of David and Shlomo, "Va'Tisba" in the days of Chizkiyah, "Va'Tosar" - in the days of Rebbi;</p>
<p class="bas indent2"><span class="nm">2.</span>It was taught that the one appointed over Rebbi's horses and mules was richer than Shevor Malka (the Persian king).</p>
<p class="bas indent1"><span class="nm">(n)</span><span class="cl">(Beraisa):</span> "Va'Tochal" in this world, "Va'Tisba" - in Yemos ha'Moshi'ach; "Va'Tosar" - in the world to come.</p>
