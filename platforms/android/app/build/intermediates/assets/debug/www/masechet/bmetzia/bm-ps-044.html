<p class="bas subject"><span class="nm">1)</span>INTENT TO BE <i>SHOLE'ACH</i> <i>YAD</i> (cont.)</p>
<p class="bas indent1"><span class="nm">(a)</span><span class="cl">Question:</span> What are the sources for their opinions?</p>
<p class="bas indent1"><span class="nm">(b)</span><span class="cl">Answer (Beraisa - Beis Shamai):</span> "Al Kol Devar Pesha" obligates for intent like for action;</p>
<p class="bas indent2"><span class="nm">1.</span>Beis Hillel say, he is liable only if he actually took the object - "Im Lo Shalach Yado."</p>
<p class="bas indent2"><span class="nm">2.</span><span class="cl">Beis Shamai:</span> It says "Al Kol Devar Pesha"!</p>
<p class="bas indent2"><span class="nm">3.</span><span class="cl">Beis Hillel:</span> It says "Im Lo Shalach Yado"!</p>
<p class="bas indent1"><span class="nm">(c)</span><span class="cl">Question:</span> What do Beis Hillel learn from "Al Kol Devar Pesha"?</p>
<p class="bas indent1"><span class="nm">(d)</span><span class="cl">Answer:</span> One might have thought that he is liable only if he himself used it. "Al Kol Devar Pesha" teaches that he is liable even if his slave or Shali'ach used it on his command.</p>
<p class="bas subject"><span class="nm">2)</span>LIABILITY FOR WHAT HE DID NOT INTEND TO TAKE</p>
<p class="bas indent1"><span class="nm">(a)</span><span class="cl">(Mishnah):</span> If he tilted a barrel...</p>
<p class="bas indent1"><span class="nm">(b)</span><span class="cl">(Rabah):</span> He is exempt on the rest only if the barrel broke, but if the wine soured, he is liable.</p>
<p class="bas indent1"><span class="nm">(c)</span><span class="cl">Question:</span> What is the reason?</p>
<p class="bas indent1"><span class="nm">(d)</span><span class="cl">Answer:</span> Taking some causes it to sour quicker (because the barrel is no longer full).</p>
<p class="bas indent1"><span class="nm">(e)</span><span class="cl">(Mishnah):</span> If he lifted a barrel and took...</p>
<p class="bas indent1"><span class="nm">(f)</span><span class="cl">(Shmuel):</span> He is liable for lifting it to take, even if he never took.</p>
<p class="bas indent1"><span class="nm">(g)</span><span class="cl">Suggestion:</span> Shmuel holds that Shelichus Yad applies even without Chisaron.</p>
<p class="bas indent1"><span class="nm">(h)</span><span class="cl">Rejection:</span> No. Here is different. Since the taker wants the rest of the barrel to help preserve the Revi'is he wants to take, he is considered a borrower.</p>
<p class="bas indent1"><span class="nm">(i)</span><span class="cl">Question (Rav Ashi):</span> If one lifts a wallet to take a coin from it, what is the law?</p>
<p class="bas indent2"><span class="nm">1.</span>Wine needs other wine to preserve it. This does not apply to coins!</p>
<p class="bas indent2"><span class="nm">2.</span>Or, perhaps he wants the coin to be guarded in the wallet. It is less likely to be lost than a loose coin!</p>
<p class="bas indent2"><span class="nm">3.</span>This question is not resolved.</p>
<p class="perekline">PEREK HA'ZAHAV</p>
<p class="bas subject"><span class="nm">3)</span>WHAT ACQUIRES WHAT</p>
<p class="bas indent1"><span class="nm">(a)</span><span class="cl">(Mishnah):</span> (In a sale, one acquires, i.e. consummates the sale, through Meshichah (taking to one's premises) of the <i>commodity</i> being sold. Meshichah of the <i>currency</i> being paid for it does not acquire. If gold coins were traded for silver coins, gold is considered the commodity and silver is the currency. Therefore,) Meshichah of gold acquires silver (i.e. the gold is his, and he must pay silver in exchange for it). Meshichah of silver does not acquire gold;</p>
<p class="bas indent1"><span class="nm">(b)</span>(Meshichah of) copper acquires silver, but silver does not acquire copper;</p>
<p class="bas indent1"><span class="nm">(c)</span>Bad coins acquire good coins, but not vice-versa;</p>
<p class="bas indent1"><span class="nm">(d)</span>A blank coin (which hasn't been stamped) acquires coins, but not vice-versa;</p>
<p class="bas indent1"><span class="nm">(e)</span>Metaltelim acquire coins, but not vice-versa;</p>
<p class="bas indent1"><span class="nm">(f)</span>All Metaltelim acquire each other.</p>
<p class="bas indent1"><span class="nm">(g)</span>If Reuven did Meshichah on Shimon's Peros to buy them and did not yet pay, he (either one) cannot retract;</p>
<p class="bas indent1"><span class="nm">(h)</span>If Reuven paid for Shimon's Peros and did not yet do Meshichah, Shimon can retract. However, Chachamim said 'He who punished the generations of the flood and the dispersion, He will punish one who does not honor his word.'</p>
<p class="bas indent1"><span class="nm">(i)</span>R. Shimon says, whoever is holding the money has the upper hand.</p>
<p class="bas subject"><span class="nm">4)</span>GOLD VERSUS SILVER</p>
<p class="bas indent1"><span class="nm">(a)</span>Rebbi taught to his son R. Shimon 'gold acquires silver.'</p>
<p class="bas indent1"><span class="nm">(b)</span><span class="cl">R. Shimon:</span> In your youth, you taught that silver acquires gold!</p>
<p class="bas indent1"><span class="nm">(c)</span><span class="cl">Question:</span> What was Rebbi's reason in his youth, and in his old age?</p>
<p class="bas indent1"><span class="nm">(d)</span><span class="cl">Answer:</span> In his youth, he reasoned that gold is more important, therefore it is the currency. In his old age, he reasoned that silver is more accepted (by sellers), so it is the currency.</p>
<p class="bas bbbline">44b----------------------------------------44b</p>
<p class="bas indent1"><span class="nm">(e)</span><span class="cl">(Rav Ashi):</span> Presumably, his first reason is correct, for the Mishnah continues 'copper acquires silver, but silver does not acquire copper';</p>
<p class="bas indent2"><span class="nm">1.</span>If silver acquires gold, we understand why this was taught. Even though silver is the commodity with respect to gold, it is the currency with respect to copper;</p>
<p class="bas indent2"><span class="nm">2.</span><span class="cl">Question:</span> If gold acquires silver, why this was taught? If silver is the currency with respect to gold (even though gold is more important), all the more so it is currency with respect to copper (which is less important and less accepted by sellers than silver)!</p>
<p class="bas indent1"><span class="nm">(f)</span><span class="cl">Rejection:</span> We needed to teach it. One might have thought that in places where copper is used, it is more accepted than silver, and it is the currency. The Mishnah teaches that this is not so, since there are places where it is not accepted.</p>
<p class="bas indent1"><span class="nm">(g)</span>(We infer from the following that) also R. Chiya says that gold is the currency with respect to silver.</p>
<p class="bas indent2"><span class="nm">1.</span>Rav borrowed gold coins from R. Chiya's daughter. Their value increased (with respect to silver). R. Chiya ruled that he returns coins like he borrowed.</p>
<p class="bas indent2"><span class="nm">2.</span>This ruling is fine if gold is the currency.</p>
<p class="bas indent2"><span class="nm">3.</span><span class="cl">Question:</span> If gold is the commodity, this is like lending a measure of grain on condition to return the same measure, which is forbidden (lest grain rise in value. This is Ribis mid'Rabanan!)</p>
<p class="bas indent1"><span class="nm">(h)</span><span class="cl">Rejection:</span> Rav had gold coins at home. In such a case, one may lend measure for measure.</p>
<p class="bas indent1"><span class="nm">(i)</span><span class="cl">(Rava):</span> The following Tana holds that gold is the currency.</p>
<p class="bas indent2"><span class="nm">1.</span><span class="cl">(Beraisa):</span> A Perutah is an eighth of an Italian Isar. This is the amount needed to make Kidushin;</p>
<p class="bas indent2"><span class="nm">2.</span>An Isar is a 24th of a silver Dinar. This is pertinent to commerce;</p>
<p class="bas indent2"><span class="nm">3.</span>A silver Dinar is a 25th of a gold Dinar. This is pertinent to redemption of a firstborn son (which is five silver Shekalim, which equal 20 silver Dinarim).</p>
<p class="bas indent2"><span class="nm">4.</span>This is fine if gold is the currency, for then its value is considered fixed (and the redemption is always four fifths of a gold Dinar);</p>
<p class="bas indent2"><span class="nm">5.</span><span class="cl">Question:</span> However, if gold is the commodity, why does the Tana gauge the redemption in gold? It fluctuates (the price of gold changes)!</p>
<p class="bas indent1"><span class="nm">(j)</span><span class="cl">(Mishnah #1 - Beis Shamai):</span> If one has silver Sela'im (a Sela equals four Dinarim) of Ma'aser Sheni, he may not make (i.e. convert) them to gold Dinarim;</p>
<p class="bas indent1"><span class="nm">(k)</span>Beis Hillel permit this.</p>
<p class="bas indent1"><span class="nm">(l)</span><span class="cl">Version #1 (R. Yochanan or Reish Lakish):</span> They argue about converting Sela'im to gold Dinarim. Beis Shamai hold that gold is the commodity, and we do not redeem currency on commodities (only on food in Yerushalayim);</p>
<p class="bas indent2"><span class="nm">1.</span>Beis Hillel hold that gold is the currency. We may redeem commodities onto currency;</p>
<p class="bas indent2"><span class="nm">2.</span>All agree that we may redeem Peros onto gold Dinarim.</p>
<p class="bas indent2"><span class="nm">3.</span><span class="cl">Question:</span> Why do Beis Shamai agree? (They say that gold is the commodity!)</p>
<p class="bas indent2"><span class="nm">4.</span><span class="cl">Answer:</span> This is for the same reason that Beis Hillel permit redeeming Peros onto silver. Even though silver is the commodity with respect to gold, it is the currency with respect to Peros;</p>
<p class="bas indent3"><span class="nm">i.</span>Likewise, Beis Shamai agree that gold is currency with respect to Peros.</p>
<p class="bas indent1"><span class="nm">(m)</span><span class="cl">(The other of R. Yochanan and Reish Lakish):</span> They argue even about redeeming Peros onto (gold) Dinarim. (Beis Shamai hold that gold is a commodity, so we do not redeem onto it).</p>
<p class="bas indent1"><span class="nm">(n)</span><span class="cl">Question:</span> If so, the Mishnah should rather teach the argument about redeeming Peros onto Dinarim!</p>
<p class="bas indent1"><span class="nm">(o)</span><span class="cl">Answer:</span> If so, one might have thought that Beis Hillel agree that gold is the commodity with respect to silver, and silver may not be redeemed onto gold.</p>
