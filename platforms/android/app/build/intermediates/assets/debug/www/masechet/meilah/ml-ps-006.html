<p class="bas indent1"><span class="nm">(a)</span><span class="cl">Support (for R. Yochanan - Beraisa - R. Shimon):</span> Sometimes Me'ilah applies to Nosar, and sometimes it does not:</p>
<p class="bas indent2"><span class="nm">1.</span><span class="cl">Version #1 (Rashi):</span> If the blood was left overnight, Me'ilah applies (if one ate) before Zerikah, but not after Zerikah.</p>

<p class="bas indent2"><span class="nm">3.</span><span class="cl">Suggestion:</span> Even though there was time to do Zerikah, (we do not consider it as if Zerikah was done,) there is Me'ilah. This shows that Heter Achilah is required to remove Me'ilah!</p>

<p class="bas indent1"><span class="nm">(d)</span><span class="cl">Question:</span> If so, why does it say that Me'ilah applies before Zerikah (but not after)? Rather, it should say Me'ilah applies if Kabalah was before sunset (leaving time for Zerikah), but not if it was after!</p>
<p class="bas indent1"><span class="nm">(e)</span><span class="cl">Answer:</span> This is what the Beraisa means. Me'ilah applies (if one ate) before there was opportunity for Zerikah, but not after there was opportunity for Zerikah.</p>

Rather, it should say that Me'ilah applies if Kabalah was before sunset (with time for Zerikah), but not if it was after!</p>
<p class="bas indent1"><span class="nm">(j)</span><span class="cl">Answer:</span> This is what the Beraisa means! Me'ilah applies (if he ate) before there was opportunity for Zerikah (because Kabalah was after sunset), but not (if he ate) after there was opportunity (Kabalah was before sunset).</p>
<p class="bas indent1"><span class="nm">(k)</span><span class="cl">Support (for R. Yochanan - Beraisa):</span> Me'ilah applies to Pigul of Kodshei Kodashim.</p>
<p class="bas indent2"><span class="nm">1.</span><span class="cl">Suggestion:</span> This is (even) after Zerikah. (Before Zerikah, Pigul applies to even to valid Kodshei Kodashim. This shows that Heter Achilah is required! (Tosfos - this supports also Rav Gidal.)</p>

<p class="bas indent1"><span class="nm">(o)</span><span class="cl">Answer:</span> The Seifa teaches that only valid Zerikah brings (Eimurei Kodshim Kalim) to Me'ilah, but even an invalid Zerikah can remove Me'ilah (from Kodshei Kodashim). (Rav Gidal is refuted.)</p>

<p class="bas subject"><span class="nm">2)</span>IS <i>ZERIKAH</i> EFFECTIVE FOR <i>YOTZEI</i>?</p>
<p class="bas indent1"><span class="nm">(a)</span><span class="cl">(Mishnah - R. Eliezer):</span> If meat of Kodshei Kodashim left the Azarah before Zerikah, (even if it was returned and Zerikah was done,) Me'ilah applies to it, and one cannot be liable for it for Pigul, Nosar or Tamei. (It is as if Zerikah was not done.)</p>
<p class="bas indent1"><span class="nm">(b)</span>R. Akiva says, (even if it was not returned, after Zerikah) Me'ilah does not apply to it, but Pigul, Nosar or Tamei can apply to it. (It is as if valid Zerikah was done.)</p>
<p class="bas indent2"><span class="nm">1.</span><span class="cl">R. Akiva:</span> If one was Makdish a Chatas, lost it, was Makdish another, then found the first and slaughtered both of them:</p>
<p class="bas indent3"><span class="nm">i.</span>Zerikah (of one) exempts its meat (from Me'ilah). It also exempts the other animal's meat (even though the latter is Pasul, since it is Mosar Chatas);</p>
<p class="bas indent3"><span class="nm">ii.</span>All the more so, in our case Zerikah should exempt meat of the animal itself (even though it is Pasul due to Yotzei)!</p>
<p class="bas indent1"><span class="nm">(c)</span>R. Eliezer says, if Eimurim of Kodshim Kalim left before Zerikah, (even if they were returned and Zerikah was done,) Me'ilah does not apply to them, and one is not liable for them for Pigul, Nosar or Tamei;</p>
<p class="bas indent1"><span class="nm">(d)</span>R. Akiva says, (Rashi - if they were returned; Rambam - in any case) Me'ilah applies to them, and one can be liable for them for Pigul, Nosar or Tamei. (R. Akiva Eiger - perhaps Rashi understands that the Eimurim left <i>Yerushalayim</i>, therefore they must be returned.)</p>
<p class="bas indent1"><span class="nm">(e)</span><span class="cl">(Gemara) Question:</span> Why must they argue in two cases?</p>
<p class="bas indent1"><span class="nm">(f)</span><span class="cl">Answer:</span> This is necessary:</p>
<p class="bas indent2"><span class="nm">1.</span>Had they argued only about Kodshei Kodashim, one might have thought that only there R. Eliezer says that Me'ilah applies, for only a valid Zerikah removes Me'ilah, but he would agree regarding Kodshim Kalim that even an invalid Zerikah can bring to Me'ilah;</p>
<p class="bas indent2"><span class="nm">2.</span>Had they argued only about Kodshei Kalim, one might have thought that only there R. Akiva says that Me'ilah applies, for even an invalid Zerikah can bring to Me'ilah, but he would agree regarding Kodshim Kalim that only a valid Zerikah removes Me'ilah. (Tosfos - on 6a, we said that it is easier to <i>remove</i> Me'ilah than to make Me'ilah apply. That was regarding Zerikas Pigul, which the Torah considers to be a valid Zerikah (to be Mechayev Kares) for one who eats the animal. Here, the Zerikah was valid. The Pesul is merely in what it should permit, therefore it is more difficult to remove Me'ilah.)</p>
<p class="bas indent1"><span class="nm">(g)</span><span class="cl">(R. Yochanan):</span> R. Akiva says that Zerikah is effective for Yotzei only if some (of the meat or Eimurim) remained inside, but not if all left. (We explain like Tosfos' text, that the following is a regular teaching, and not a question.)</p>
