<p class="bas subject"><span class="nm">1)</span>LAWS OF COLLECTING DAMAGES</p>
<p class="bas indent1"><span class="nm">(a)</span><span class="cl">Answer:</span> The Chidush is the Reisha, which says 'free men, members of the covenant.'</p>
<p class="bas indent2"><span class="nm">1.</span>'Free men' excludes slaves. 'Members of the covenant' excludes Nochrim.</p>
<p class="bas indent2"><span class="nm">2.</span>The Mishnah needed to teach about both.</p>
<p class="bas indent3"><span class="nm">i.</span>Had it taught only about slaves, one might have thought that this is because they have no lineage, but Nochrim have lineage, so they collect damages;</p>
<p class="bas indent3"><span class="nm">ii.</span>Had it taught only about Nochrim, one might have thought that this is because they have only seven Mitzvos, but slaves have Mitzvos (that women have), so they collect damages.</p>
<p class="bas indent1"><span class="nm">(b)</span><span class="cl">(Mishnah):</span> Women are included in damages.</p>
<p class="bas indent1"><span class="nm">(c)</span><span class="cl">Question:</span> What is the source of this?</p>
<p class="bas indent1"><span class="nm">(d)</span><span class="cl">Answer (Rav Yehudah):</span> "A man or woman who will do any sin" equates men and women for all punishments;</p>
<p class="bas indent1"><span class="nm">(e)</span><span class="cl">(D'Vei R. Elazar):</span> "These are the Mishpatim (laws) that you will put in front of them" equates men and women for all Dinim (monetary laws);</p>
<p class="bas indent1"><span class="nm">(f)</span><span class="cl">(D'Vei Chizkiyah):</span> "And (an ox) will kill a man or woman" equates men and women regarding death.</p>
<p class="bas indent1"><span class="nm">(g)</span>The Torah needed to teach all of these:</p>
<p class="bas indent2"><span class="nm">1.</span>Had it taught only about punishments, one might have thought that this is so she will get atonement, but (monetary) judgments are for men;</p>
<p class="bas indent2"><span class="nm">2.</span>Had it taught only about Dinim, one might have thought that this is so she can do business and earn a living, but only men get punishments for atonement, for they are obligated in all the Mitzvos;</p>
<p class="bas indent2"><span class="nm">3.</span>Had it taught only about these two, one might have thought that this is for atonement and business, but Kofer (ransom to atone for one whose animal killed someone) would apply only to a man (who was killed);</p>
<p class="bas indent2"><span class="nm">4.</span>Had it taught only about Kofer, one might have thought that this is because a life was lost, but in other cases, women are not like men.</p>
<p class="bas subject"><span class="nm">2)</span>IS HALF-PAYMENT FOR THE DAMAGE OF A <i>TAM</i> A FINE?</p>
<p class="bas indent1"><span class="nm">(a)</span><span class="cl">(Mishnah):</span> The damager and victim both participate in payments.</p>
<p class="bas indent1"><span class="nm">(b)</span><span class="cl">(Rav Papa):</span> A Tam that pays half-damage is Mamon (a proper obligation. It is not a fine.)</p>
<p class="bas indent1"><span class="nm">(c)</span><span class="cl">(Rav Huna brei d'Rav Yehoshua):</span> It is a fine.</p>
<p class="bas indent2"><span class="nm">1.</span>Rav Papa holds that oxen are not considered guarded. Really, the owner should pay full damage;</p>
<p class="bas indent3"><span class="nm">i.</span>The Torah was lenient, because he was not yet warned to guard it.</p>
<p class="bas indent2"><span class="nm">2.</span>Rav Huna brei d'Rav Yehoshua holds that oxen are considered guarded. Really, the owner should be exempt;</p>
<p class="bas indent3"><span class="nm">i.</span>The Torah fined him, to encourage him to guard his ox.</p>
<p class="bas indent1"><span class="nm">(d)</span><span class="cl">(Mishnah):</span> The damager and victim are both involved in payments.</p>
<p class="bas indent1"><span class="nm">(e)</span><span class="cl">Question:</span> This is like the opinion that half-damage is Mamon. The victim loses half of what he deserves.</p>
<p class="bas indent2"><span class="nm">1.</span>According to the opinion that it is a fine, the victim receives what he does not deserve. Can we say he participates in the payments?!</p>
<p class="bas indent1"><span class="nm">(f)</span><span class="cl">Answer:</span> The Mishnah refers to the decrease in value of a carcass, which the victim suffers.</p>
<p class="bas indent1"><span class="nm">(g)</span><span class="cl">Question:</span> A previous Mishnah already taught this! 'Payments of damage' teaches that the victim deals with the carcass!</p>
<p class="bas indent1"><span class="nm">(h)</span><span class="cl">Answer:</span> The Mishnah teaches this about a Tam, and about a Mu'ad. It needs to teach about both.</p>
<p class="bas indent2"><span class="nm">1.</span>Had it taught only about a Tam, one might have thought that because the damager was not yet warned to guard his ox, the Torah did not make him lose the decreased value of the carcass (but regarding a Mu'ad, he would lose this);</p>
<p class="bas indent2"><span class="nm">2.</span>Had it taught only about a Mu'ad, one might have thought that because he pays full damage, the Torah does not make him suffer the decrease in value of the carcass (but for a Tam, he does).</p>
<p class="bas indent1"><span class="nm">(i)</span><span class="cl">(Mishnah):</span> The difference between Tam and Mu'ad, is that a Tam pays half-damage (up to) its own value, and a Mu'ad pays full damage, even above its own value.</p>
<p class="bas indent1"><span class="nm">(j)</span><span class="cl">Question:</span> If half-damage is a fine, the Mishnah should also say that a Tam does not pay due to the owner's admission!</p>
<p class="bas indent1"><span class="nm">(k)</span><span class="cl">Answer:</span> The Tana did not list all differences.</p>
<p class="bas indent1"><span class="nm">(l)</span><span class="cl">Question:</span> Surely, he did not omit only one thing. What else did he omit?</p>
<p class="bas indent1"><span class="nm">(m)</span><span class="cl">Answer:</span> He omitted that only a Mu'ad pays Kofer.</p>
<p class="bas indent1"><span class="nm">(n)</span><span class="cl">Objection:</span> (Perhaps) our Mishnah is like R. Yosi ha'Glili, who says that a Tam pays half-Kofer!</p>
<p class="bas bbbline">15b----------------------------------------15b</p>
<p class="bas indent1"><span class="nm">(o)</span><span class="cl">Question (Mishnah):</span> If one said 'my ox killed Ploni', or 'it killed Ploni's ox', he pays due to his own admission.</p>
<p class="bas indent2"><span class="nm">1.</span><span class="cl">Suggestion:</span> This refers to a Tam (this shows that it is Mamon)!</p>
<p class="bas indent1"><span class="nm">(p)</span>Rejection No, it refers to a Mu'ad.</p>
<p class="bas indent1"><span class="nm">(q)</span><span class="cl">(Inference):</span> A Tam would not pay due to its own admission.</p>
<p class="bas indent1"><span class="nm">(r)</span><span class="cl">Question (Reisha):</span> If one said 'my ox killed Ploni's slave' he does not pay due to his own admission.</p>
<p class="bas indent2"><span class="nm">1.</span>If (q) is correct, the Mishnah could have distinguished within the first case. He pays due to his own admission for a Mu'ad, but not for a Tam!</p>
<p class="bas indent1"><span class="nm">(s)</span><span class="cl">Answer:</span> The Mishnah discusses only a Mu'ad.</p>
<p class="bas subject"><span class="nm">3)</span>IS HALF-PAYMENT FOR THE DAMAGE OF A <i>TAM</i> A FINE? (cont.)</p>
<p class="bas indent1"><span class="nm">(a)</span><span class="cl">(Beraisa):</span> The general rule is, any payment more than the damage is not paid due to an admission.</p>
<p class="bas indent1"><span class="nm">(b)</span><span class="cl">(Inference):</span> Any payment less than the damage is paid due to an admission.</p>
<p class="bas indent1"><span class="nm">(c)</span><span class="cl">Rejection:</span> No. The inference is that any payment equal to the damage is paid due to an admission.</p>
<p class="bas indent1"><span class="nm">(d)</span><span class="cl">Question:</span> Do you say that less than the damage is paid due to an admission?</p>
<p class="bas indent2"><span class="nm">1.</span>If so, why did the Mishnah say 'any payment more than the damage is not paid due to an admission?' It should have said 'any payment not equal to the damage is not paid due to an admission', to include more or less!</p>
<p class="bas indent2"><span class="nm">2.</span>Rav Huna brei d'Rav Yehoshua is refuted.</p>
<p class="bas indent1"><span class="nm">(e)</span>The Halachah is, half-damage is a fine.</p>
<p class="bas indent1"><span class="nm">(f)</span><span class="cl">Question:</span> This was refuted. It cannot be the Halachah!</p>
<p class="bas indent1"><span class="nm">(g)</span><span class="cl">Answer:</span> The refutation was because the Mishnah did not say 'any payment not equal to the damage is not paid regarding the person's admission.' The Mishnah could not say this, for it is not always true;</p>
<p class="bas indent2"><span class="nm">1.</span>A tradition from Moshe from Sinai teaches that half-damage of pebbles is not a fine.</p>
<p class="bas indent1"><span class="nm">(h)</span>Since we say that half-damage is a fine, if a dog ate a sheep, or a cat ate a chicken, this is abnormal (hence a Toldah of Keren), so we do not collect it in Bavel (like all other fines).</p>
<p class="bas indent2"><span class="nm">1.</span>This is only if it ate a large sheep or chicken. It is normal for them to eat small ones.</p>
<p class="bas indent1"><span class="nm">(i)</span>If the victim seized payment, we do not make him return it.</p>
<p class="bas indent1"><span class="nm">(j)</span>If the victim requested to fix a time to go to Eretz Yisrael to judge the case, we comply. If the damager does not agree, we excommunicate him.</p>
<p class="bas indent1"><span class="nm">(k)</span>In any case, we excommunicate him until he removes the damager.</p>
<p class="bas indent2"><span class="nm">1.</span><span class="cl">(Beraisa - R. Nasan):</span> "Do not put blood in your house" forbids one to have a wild dog or a rickety ladder in his house.</p>
<p class="bas subject"><span class="nm">4)</span><i>TAM</i> AND <i>MU'AD</i></p>
<p class="bas indent1"><span class="nm">(a)</span><span class="cl">(Mishnah):</span> There are five Tam damagers, and five Mu'ad damagers:</p>
<p class="bas indent2"><span class="nm">1.</span>An animal is not Mu'ad to gore, push, bite, crouch or kick;</p>
<p class="bas indent2"><span class="nm">2.</span>Shen is Mu'ad to eat food fitting for it. Regel is Mu'ad to break things while it walks;</p>
<p class="bas indent2"><span class="nm">3.</span>A Mu'ad ox; an ox that damages in the victim's premises; and man.</p>
<p class="bas indent1"><span class="nm">(b)</span>A wolf, lion, bear, leopard, Bardelus, and snake are Mu'ad;</p>
<p class="bas indent1"><span class="nm">(c)</span>R. Elazar says, if they are domesticated, they are not Mu'ad, except for a snake, which is always Mu'ad.</p>
<p class="bas indent1"><span class="nm">(d)</span><span class="cl">(Gemara):</span> Since it says that Shen is Mu'ad to eat fitting food, this must be in the victim's premises, and it says that a Tam pays half-damage.</p>
<p class="bas indent2"><span class="nm">1.</span>This is like Chachamim, who say that Keren pays half-damage in the victim's premises.</p>
<p class="bas indent1"><span class="nm">(e)</span><span class="cl">Question:</span> The Reisha calls an ox that damages in the victim's premises Mu'ad. This is like R. Tarfon!</p>
<p class="bas indent2"><span class="nm">1.</span>Is the Reisha like Chachamim, and the Seifa is like R. Tarfon?!</p>
<p class="bas indent1"><span class="nm">(f)</span><span class="cl">Answer #1 (Shmuel):</span> Yes!</p>
