<p class="bas subject"><span class="nm">1)</span>SOMEONE WHO IS NO LONGER RELATED</p>
<p class="bas indent1"><span class="nm">(a)</span>After Mar Ukva's wife died, her brothers came in front of for Mar Ukva for judgment.</p>
<p class="bas indent1"><span class="nm">(b)</span><span class="cl">Mar Ukva:</span> I cannot judge your case.</p>
<p class="bas indent1"><span class="nm">(c)</span><span class="cl">Her brothers:</span> You think that the Halachah follows R. Yehudah. We will bring a letter from Eretz Yisrael saying that the Halachah does not follow R. Yehudah!</p>
<p class="bas indent1"><span class="nm">(d)</span><span class="cl">Mar Ukva:</span> I did not disqualify myself because we were related, rather, because I know that you do not comply with the verdict.</p>
<p class="bas subject"><span class="nm">2)</span>FRIENDS AND ENEMIES</p>
<p class="bas indent1"><span class="nm">(a)</span><span class="cl">(Mishnah):</span> A close friend refers to a Shushbin.</p>
<p class="bas indent1"><span class="nm">(b)</span><span class="cl">Question:</span> For how long is he disqualified?</p>
<p class="bas indent1"><span class="nm">(c)</span><span class="cl">Answer #1 (R. Aba):</span> He is disqualified during the week of festivities after the Nisu'in.</p>
<p class="bas indent1"><span class="nm">(d)</span><span class="cl">Answer #2 (Rava):</span> He is disqualified the day he brought gifts.</p>
<p class="bas indent1"><span class="nm">(e)</span><span class="cl">(Mishnah):</span> An enemy is one who did not speak to him for three days due to hatred.</p>
<p class="bas indent1"><span class="nm">(f)</span><span class="cl">(Beraisa):</span> If "v'Hu Lo Oyev Lo", he can testify for him. If "v'Lo Mevakesh Ra'aso", he can judge him.</p>
<p class="bas indent1"><span class="nm">(g)</span><span class="cl">Question:</span> This is the source for an enemy. What is the source for a close friend?</p>
<p class="bas indent1"><span class="nm">(h)</span><span class="cl">Answer #1:</span> We read this as if it said 'he does not hate nor love him', he can testify for him. 'He does not seek his harm or benefit', he can judge him.</p>
<p class="bas indent1"><span class="nm">(i)</span><span class="cl">Objection:</span> The verse does not mention loving him!</p>
<p class="bas indent1"><span class="nm">(j)</span><span class="cl">Answer #2:</span> Reasoning teaches this. An enemy is disqualified because he dislikes him (this biases his judgment). Likewise, a close friend is disqualified because he likes him!</p>
<p class="bas indent1"><span class="nm">(k)</span><span class="cl">Question:</span> How do Chachamim (who Machshir enemies and friends for testimony) expound?</p>
<p class="bas indent1"><span class="nm">(l)</span><span class="cl">Answer:</span> They disqualify from judging, like R. Yehudah. The other part of the verse teaches R. Yosi b'Rebbi Yehudah's law.</p>
<p class="bas indent2"><span class="nm">1.</span><span class="cl">(Beraisa - R. Yosi b'Rebbi Yehudah):</span> "V'Hu Lo Oyev Lo v'Lo Mevakesh Ra'aso" teaches that two Chachamim who hate each other may not sit on a Beis Din together.</p>
<p class="bas subject"><span class="nm">3)</span>INTERROGATION OF WITNESSES</p>
<p class="bas indent1"><span class="nm">(a)</span><span class="cl">(Mishnah):</span> To interrogate witnesses, we bring them into a room and threaten them.</p>
<p class="bas indent1"><span class="nm">(b)</span>Everyone leaves except for the most important witness. We ask him 'how do you know that Reuven owes Shimon?'</p>
<p class="bas indent2"><span class="nm">1.</span>If he says 'Reuven himself told me', or 'Ploni told me', this is not testimony;</p>
<p class="bas indent2"><span class="nm">2.</span>He must say 'Reuven admitted to Shimon in front of us that he owes him 200.'</p>
<p class="bas indent1"><span class="nm">(c)</span>We bring in the second witness and interrogate him.</p>
<p class="bas indent1"><span class="nm">(d)</span>If their testimonies match, the judges debate the matter:</p>
<p class="bas indent2"><span class="nm">1.</span>If two decide Zakai (he is exempt) and one says Chayav, he is exempt;</p>
<p class="bas indent2"><span class="nm">2.</span>If two decide Chayav and one says Zakai, he is Chayav;</p>
<p class="bas indent1"><span class="nm">(e)</span>If one is undecided, even if the other two decide the same way (Zakai or Chayav), we add more judges.</p>
<p class="bas indent1"><span class="nm">(f)</span>When they finish deciding, they bring them (this will be explained) in. The greatest judge says 'Ploni, you are Chayav. Almoni, you are Zakai.'</p>
<p class="bas indent1"><span class="nm">(g)</span><span class="cl">Question:</span> What is the source that afterwards, a judge may not tell Ploni 'I wanted to acquit you, but they outnumbered me'?</p>
<p class="bas indent1"><span class="nm">(h)</span><span class="cl">Answer:</span> "Lo Selech Rachil b'Amecha" (some texts - "Holech Rachil Megaleh Sod").</p>
<p class="bas indent1"><span class="nm">(i)</span><span class="cl">(Gemara) Question:</span> What do we say to threaten them?</p>
<p class="bas indent1"><span class="nm">(j)</span><span class="cl">Answer #1 (Rav Yehudah):</span> "Nesi'im v'Ru'ach v'Geshem Ayin Ish Mis'halel b'Matas Sheker" (false testimony can cause a famine).</p>
<p class="bas indent1"><span class="nm">(k)</span><span class="cl">Objection (Rava):</span> Perhaps they know a trade, and they are not concerned if there will be a famine!</p>
<p class="bas indent1"><span class="nm">(l)</span><span class="cl">Answer #2 (Rava):</span> "Mefitz v'Cherev (a club and sword, i.e. rampant death results from)... Ed Sheker."</p>
<p class="bas indent1"><span class="nm">(m)</span><span class="cl">Objection (Rav Ashi):</span> Perhaps that does not scare them. They think that people die only when their (predestined) time comes!</p>
<p class="bas indent1"><span class="nm">(n)</span><span class="cl">Answer #3 (Rav Ashi):</span> We tell them that false witnesses are a disgrace in the eyes of those who hire them - "v'Hoshivu Shnayim Anashim Bnei Vliya'al" (the ones who hire them call them worthless).</p>
<p class="bas subject"><span class="nm">4)</span>A PROPER ADMISSION</p>
<p class="bas indent1"><span class="nm">(a)</span><span class="cl">(Mishnah):</span> If he says 'Reuven himself told me' (this is invalid). He must say 'Reuven admitted to Shimon in front of us that he owes him 200.'</p>
<p class="bas indent1"><span class="nm">(b)</span>This supports Rav Yehudah.</p>
<p class="bas indent2"><span class="nm">1.</span><span class="cl">(Rav Yehudah):</span> An admission is valid only if he said 'you are witnesses against me.'</p>
<p class="bas indent2"><span class="nm">2.</span><span class="cl">Version #1 (Rif):</span> R. Chiya bar Aba taught the same law.</p>
<p class="bas indent1"><span class="nm">(c)</span><span class="cl">Version #2 (our text):</span> R. Chiya bar Aba taught similarly.</p>
<p class="bas indent2"><span class="nm">1.</span><span class="cl">(R. Chiya bar Aba):</span> If Reuven admitted to Shimon that he owes him 100, and tomorrow he says 'I was only joking', he is exempt. (end of Version #2)</p>
<p class="bas indent2"><span class="nm">2.</span><span class="cl">Support (Beraisa):</span> If Reuven admitted to Shimon that he owes him 100, and tomorrow he says 'I was only joking', he is exempt;</p>
<p class="bas indent2"><span class="nm">3.</span>Further, if Shimon hid witnesses in back of the fence, and Reuven admitted to Shimon, and Shimon asked 'would you like to admit in front of Ploni and Almoni', and Reuven said 'no, I fear lest they take me to Beis Din', and tomorrow Reuven says 'I was only joking', he is exempt;</p>
<p class="bas indent2"><span class="nm">4.</span>We do not suggest claims to a Mesis (enticer to idolatry).</p>
<p class="bas indent2"><span class="nm">5.</span><span class="cl">Question:</span> We were not discussing a Mesis!</p>
<p class="bas indent2"><span class="nm">6.</span><span class="cl">Answer:</span> The Beraisa is abbreviated. It means as follows. If Reuven did not claim that he was joking, we do not claim for him;</p>
<p class="bas indent3"><span class="nm">i.</span>In capital cases, even if he does not claim for himself, we suggest claims to exempt him;</p>
<p class="bas indent3"><span class="nm">ii.</span>We do not suggest claims to a Mesis.</p>
<p class="bas indent1"><span class="nm">(d)</span><span class="cl">Question:</span> Why is the law of a Mesis different?</p>
<p class="bas indent1"><span class="nm">(e)</span><span class="cl">Answer (Rav Chama bar Chanina):</span> The Torah says "Lo Sachmol v'Lo Sechaseh Alav."</p>
<p class="bas indent2"><span class="nm">1.</span><span class="cl">(R. Shmuel bar Nachman):</span> We learn from the serpent (that enticed Chavah) that we do not suggest claims to a Mesis.</p>
<p class="bas indent2"><span class="nm">2.</span>(R. Simla'i). The serpent could have made many claims, but it did not;</p>
<p class="bas indent3"><span class="nm">i.</span>Hash-m did not claim for it, because we do not claim for a Mesis.</p>
<p class="bas indent2"><span class="nm">3.</span><span class="cl">Question:</span> What could it have claimed?</p>
<p class="bas indent2"><span class="nm">4.</span><span class="cl">Answer:</span> One must listen to the Rebbi, and not to the Talmid (Chavah should not have listened to it).</p>
<p class="bas indent1"><span class="nm">(f)</span><span class="cl">(Chizkiyah):</span> We learn from Chavah that one who adds will come to detract - "Amar Elokim... v'Lo Sig'u Bo Pen Temusun" (she did not die from touching it, so she ate from it).</p>
<p class="bas indent1"><span class="nm">(g)</span><span class="cl">(Rav Mesharshiya):</span> We learn from "Amasayim (two Amos)" - if one removes the 'Aleph', it reads 'Ma'asayim (200).'</p>
<p class="bas indent1"><span class="nm">(h)</span><span class="cl">(Rav Ashi):</span> We learn from "Ashtei Erseh (11)" - if one removes the 'Ayin', it reads 'Shtei Esreh (12).'</p>
<p class="bas indent1"><span class="nm">(i)</span><span class="cl">(Abaye):</span> Reuven is exempt only if he claims that he was joking, but if he denies that he admitted, he is established to be a liar, and he is Chayav.</p>
<p class="bas bbbline">29b----------------------------------------29b</p>
<p class="bas indent1"><span class="nm">(j)</span><span class="cl">(Rav Papa brei d'Rav Acha bar Ada):</span> One does not remember meaningless things (perhaps he was joking, and forgot the matter, therefore he is exempt).</p>
<p class="bas indent1"><span class="nm">(k)</span>Levi hid witnesses in back of curtains around the bed and claimed 100 from Yehudah. Yehudah admitted.</p>
<p class="bas indent2"><span class="nm">1.</span><span class="cl">Levi:</span> May the waking and sleeping be witnesses?</p>
<p class="bas indent2"><span class="nm">2.</span><span class="cl">Yehudah:</span> No.</p>
<p class="bas indent1"><span class="nm">(l)</span><span class="cl">(Rav Kahana):</span> He did not want them to be witnesses (so he is exempt)!</p>
<p class="bas indent1"><span class="nm">(m)</span>Reuven hid witnesses in a grave and claimed 100 from Yehudah; Yehudah admitted.</p>
<p class="bas indent2"><span class="nm">1.</span><span class="cl">Levi:</span> May the living and dead be witnesses?</p>
<p class="bas indent2"><span class="nm">2.</span><span class="cl">Yehudah:</span> No.</p>
<p class="bas indent1"><span class="nm">(n)</span><span class="cl">(Reish Lakish):</span> He did not want them to be witnesses (so he is exempt)!</p>
<p class="bas indent1"><span class="nm">(o)</span><span class="cl">(Ravina):</span> Rav Yehudah taught that he must say 'you are witnesses' for the admission to be valid. From the above episodes, we learn that it suffices for the lender to say it and the borrower to be silent;</p>
<p class="bas indent2"><span class="nm">1.</span>He was exempt because he said 'no.' Had he been silent, he would have been Chayav!</p>
<p class="bas indent1"><span class="nm">(p)</span>Reuven had a reputation that he owed many people. He said 'I owe only Ploni and Almoni.' They claimed from him in Beis Din.</p>
<p class="bas indent2"><span class="nm">1.</span><span class="cl">Rav Nachman:</span> It is normal for one to falsely claim that he owes money, so people will not think that he is rich.</p>
<p class="bas indent1"><span class="nm">(q)</span>Shimon had a reputation that he was a rich miser. Just before he died, he said 'I owe Ploni and Almoni.' They claimed from his heirs.</p>
<p class="bas indent2"><span class="nm">1.</span><span class="cl">R. Yishmael b'Rebbi Yosi:</span> <i>In his lifetime</i> one will falsely claim that he owes, lest people think that he is rich, but not when he is dying!</p>
<p class="bas indent2"><span class="nm">2.</span>The heirs paid half. Ploni and Almoni claimed the other half from them in R. Chiya's Beis Din.</p>
<p class="bas indent2"><span class="nm">3.</span><span class="cl">R. Chiya:</span> Just like one does not want people to think that he is rich, he does not them to think that his sons are rich! (Perhaps it was a false admission.)</p>
<p class="bas indent2"><span class="nm">4.</span><span class="cl">The heirs:</span> We should get back the half we paid!</p>
<p class="bas indent2"><span class="nm">5.</span><span class="cl">R. Chiya:</span> The Chacham (R. Yishmael b'Rebbi Yosi) already ruled. (They need not return the money.)</p>
<p class="bas subject"><span class="nm">5)</span>MAY WE WRITE AN ODISA?</p>
<p class="bas indent1"><span class="nm">(a)</span>If Shimon admitted in front of two witnesses. If they made a Kinyan, the witnesses may write a document; if not, not.</p>
<p class="bas indent1"><span class="nm">(b)</span><span class="cl">(Rav):</span> If he admitted in front of three, even if they did not make a Kinyan, they may write (for they are a Beis Din. They even have the power to make Hefker).</p>
<p class="bas indent1"><span class="nm">(c)</span><span class="cl">(Rav Asi):</span> They may not write.</p>
<p class="bas indent1"><span class="nm">(d)</span>A case occurred, and Rav was concerned for Rav Asi's opinion.</p>
<p class="bas indent1"><span class="nm">(e)</span><span class="cl">(Rav Ada bar Ahavah):</span> Sometimes we write Odisah (an admission in front of three without a Kinyan), sometimes we do not:</p>
<p class="bas indent2"><span class="nm">1.</span>If the three were already sitting, he did not make them a Beis Din, they are only like witnesses, they do not write;</p>
<p class="bas indent2"><span class="nm">2.</span>If he gathered them, he made them a Beis Din, they write.</p>
<p class="bas indent1"><span class="nm">(f)</span><span class="cl">(Rava):</span> Even if he gathered them, they do not write unless he said 'you should be judges.'</p>
<p class="bas indent1"><span class="nm">(g)</span><span class="cl">(Mar bar Rav Ashi):</span> Even if he gathered them and said 'you should be judges', they do not write unless they had a fixed place and summonsed the borrower to Beis Din.</p>
<p class="bas indent1"><span class="nm">(h)</span>If Reuven admitted to Metaltelim, they may write only if they made a Kinyan;</p>

<p class="bas indent1"><span class="nm">(n)</span><span class="cl">Answer #1 (Ravina):</span> They are considered like land.</p>
<p class="bas indent1"><span class="nm">(o)</span><span class="cl">Answer #2 (Rav Ashi):</span> Since the receiving party has not yet collected the property, they may not write.</p>
<p class="bas indent1"><span class="nm">(p)</span><span class="cl">(Abaye and Rava):</span> If a (document of) Odisah did not say '(the giver) said 'write, sign and give it to him', Reish Lakish's Chazakah applies.</p>
<p class="bas indent2"><span class="nm">1.</span><span class="cl">(Reish Lakish):</span> We have a Chazakah that witnesses would not sign a document unless the seller is old enough (to sell land, 20 years old).</p>
<p class="bas indent2"><span class="nm">2.</span>(Similarly, witnesses would not sign an Odisah unless the giver said 'write, sign and give it to him.' Surely, the scribe merely omitted writing this.)</p>
<p class="bas indent1"><span class="nm">(q)</span><span class="cl">Objection (Rav Papa):</span> Many judges do not know (whether or not we write an Odisah made in front of two people if no Kinyan was made). May we assume that all scribes know it?!</p>
