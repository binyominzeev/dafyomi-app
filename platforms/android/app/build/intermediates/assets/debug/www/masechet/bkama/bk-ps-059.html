<p class="bas subject"><span class="nm">1)</span>PAYING THE FUTURE PRICE</p>
<p class="bas indent1"><span class="nm">(a)</span><span class="cl">(Abaye):</span> R. Yosi ha'Glili and R. Yishmael hold similarly.</p>
<p class="bas indent2"><span class="nm">1.</span>He refers to R. Yosi ha'Glili in the above Beraisa, and R. Yishmael in the coming Beraisa.</p>
<p class="bas indent2"><span class="nm">2.</span><span class="cl">(Beraisa - R. Yishmael):</span> "From the best of his field and vineyard he will pay" - from land equal to the best land of the victim;</p>
<p class="bas indent2"><span class="nm">3.</span>R. Akiva says, the verse teaches that damages are collected from Idis, and Kal va'Chomer to Hekdesh.</p>
<p class="bas indent1"><span class="nm">(b)</span><span class="cl">(Abaye):</span> Do not learn like Rav Idi bar Avin.</p>
<p class="bas indent2"><span class="nm">1.</span><span class="cl">(Rav Idi bar Avin):</span> If a patch of a field was consumed, and we are unsure which one, he pays like the best patch we see there.</p>
<p class="bas indent1"><span class="nm">(c)</span><span class="cl">Question:</span> Why shouldn't we learn like him?</p>
<p class="bas indent1"><span class="nm">(d)</span><span class="cl">Answer:</span> The one who wants to collect must bring proof.</p>
<p class="bas indent1"><span class="nm">(e)</span><span class="cl">(Abaye):</span> Rather, he pays like the best (future) price.</p>
<p class="bas indent2"><span class="nm">1.</span><span class="cl">Question:</span> What is that?</p>
<p class="bas indent2"><span class="nm">2.</span><span class="cl">Answer:</span> It is the price at harvest time.</p>
<p class="bas indent1"><span class="nm">(f)</span><span class="cl">(Beraisa - R. Shimon ben Yehudah):</span> This is only when it ate immature grapes or figs that were just budding.</p>
<p class="bas indent1"><span class="nm">(g)</span><span class="cl">Inference:</span> If it ate Semadar (right after budding), we view them as if they were ready to be harvested.</p>
<p class="bas indent1"><span class="nm">(h)</span><span class="cl">Question (Seifa):</span> If it ate Pagim or Boser (proper fruit that is not fully grown), we view them as if they were ready to be harvested;</p>
<p class="bas indent2"><span class="nm">1.</span><span class="cl">Inference:</span> If it ate Semadar, we calculate the decline in (current value)!</p>
<p class="bas indent1"><span class="nm">(i)</span><span class="cl">Answer (Ravina):</span> We read the Beraisa as follows: R. Shimon ben Yehudah says, this is only when it ate grapes or figs that were just budding; but if it ate Semadar, Pagim or Boser, we view them as if they were ready to be harvested.</p>
<p class="bas indent1"><span class="nm">(j)</span><span class="cl">Question:</span> That is R. Yehoshua's opinion!</p>
<p class="bas indent1"><span class="nm">(k)</span><span class="cl">Answer:</span> They argue about whether or not we deduct for weakening of the vines that would have occurred had the grapes finished growing. We cannot tell who holds which way.</p>
<p class="bas indent1"><span class="nm">(l)</span><span class="cl">(Abaye):</span> We can tell! R. Shimon ben Yehudah is concerned for weakening of the vines;</p>
<p class="bas indent2"><span class="nm">1.</span><span class="cl">(Beraisa - R. Shimon ben Yehudah):</span> If Reuven raped a virgin, he does not pay for pain (of breaking the Besulim), for she would have experienced the same pain in her first Bi'ah when she gets married.</p>
<p class="bas indent2"><span class="nm">2.</span><span class="cl">Chachamim:</span> The pain when one is forced is much greater than the pain of one who is willing.</p>
<p class="bas indent1"><span class="nm">(m)</span><span class="cl">(Abaye):</span> R. Shimon ben Yehudah (above) and the following Tana'im hold similarly.</p>
<p class="bas indent2"><span class="nm">1.</span><span class="cl">(Beraisa - R. Yosi):</span> We deduct the cost of a midwife (when evaluating the payment for a fetus);</p>
<p class="bas indent2"><span class="nm">2.</span>Ben Azai says, we deduct the additional food that she would have eaten in the days of Kishuy (when she is in pain, before the birth).</p>
<p class="bas indent3"><span class="nm">i.</span>R. Yosi holds that all the more so we deduct the additional food;</p>
<p class="bas indent3"><span class="nm">ii.</span>Ben Azai holds that we do not deduct the cost of a midwife. Her husband can say that his wife does not need one.</p>
<p class="bas subject"><span class="nm">2)</span>EVALUATING THE DAMAGE AMONG 60 TIMES THE DAMAGED AREA</p>
<p class="bas indent1"><span class="nm">(a)</span><span class="cl">Version #1:</span> Rav Papa and Rav Huna brei d'Rav Yehoshua ruled like Rav Nachman (who estimates the damage amidst 60 times as much).</p>
<p class="bas indent1"><span class="nm">(b)</span><span class="cl">Version #2:</span> Rav Papa and Rav Huna brei d'Rav Yehoshua estimated the damage to a date tree among a small area of land.</p>
<p class="bas indent1"><span class="nm">(c)</span>The Halachah follows them regarding date trees of Aram. The Halachah follows the Reish Galusa (we estimate the damage by itself) regarding Persian date trees (which are more (Rashi; Aruch - less) prestigious).</p>
<p class="bas bbbline">59b----------------------------------------59b</p>
<p class="bas indent1"><span class="nm">(d)</span>Eliezer Ze'iri was wearing black shoes (like a mourner) in the Neharda'a market. Men of the Reish Galusa's house asked him about this.</p>
<p class="bas indent2"><span class="nm">1.</span><span class="cl">Eliezer:</span> I am mourning over Yerushalayim!</p>
<p class="bas indent2"><span class="nm">2.</span><span class="cl">The men:</span> You consider yourself important enough to mourn over Yerushalayim? This is haughtiness!</p>
<p class="bas indent2"><span class="nm">3.</span>They seized him; he said that he is a great Chacham, they may ask him, or he will ask them. They chose the latter.</p>
<p class="bas indent2"><span class="nm">4.</span><span class="cl">Eliezer:</span> If a man cut dates that were not fully grown, how much does he pay?</p>
<p class="bas indent2"><span class="nm">5.</span><span class="cl">The men:</span> Their value.</p>
<p class="bas indent2"><span class="nm">6.</span><span class="cl">Eliezer:</span> But they would have become full dates!</p>
<p class="bas indent2"><span class="nm">7.</span><span class="cl">The men:</span> He pays for full dates.</p>
<p class="bas indent2"><span class="nm">8.</span><span class="cl">Eliezer:</span> But he did not eat full dates!</p>
<p class="bas indent2"><span class="nm">9.</span><span class="cl">The men:</span> What do you say he pays?</p>
<p class="bas indent2"><span class="nm">10.</span><span class="cl">Eliezer:</span> We evaluate among 60 times as much.</p>
<p class="bas indent2"><span class="nm">11.</span><span class="cl">The men:</span> Who holds like you?</p>
<p class="bas indent2"><span class="nm">12.</span><span class="cl">Eliezer:</span> Shmuel does. You can send this question to him!</p>
<p class="bas indent3"><span class="nm">i.</span>Shmuel said like Eliezer. They released him.</p>
<p class="bas subject"><span class="nm">3)</span>FINISHED FRUIT</p>
<p class="bas indent1"><span class="nm">(a)</span><span class="cl">(Mishnah):</span> R. Shimon says, if it ate finished fruits (it pays the full value).</p>
<p class="bas indent1"><span class="nm">(b)</span><span class="cl">Question:</span> Why is this so? "It will consume in a different field" teaches that we evaluate like part of a field!</p>
<p class="bas indent1"><span class="nm">(c)</span><span class="cl">Answer:</span> That is only when it eats something that needs (to keep growing in) a field.</p>
<p class="bas indent1"><span class="nm">(d)</span><span class="cl">(Rav Huna bar Chiya):</span> Rav ruled in a case like R. Meir (as follows). He taught that the Halachah follows R. Shimon (in our Mishnah).</p>
<p class="bas indent2"><span class="nm">1.</span><span class="cl">(Beraisa R. Meir):</span> If Reuven wrote a document selling to Shimon the field designated to pay his wife's Kesuvah, and she did not sign, and he wrote a document selling it to Levi and she signed, she forfeits her Kesuvah;</p>
<p class="bas indent2"><span class="nm">2.</span>R. Yehudah says, she can say, I signed only to please my husband. I did not forfeit anything!</p>
<p class="bas subject"><span class="nm">4)</span>PERMISSION TO PILE UP FRUIT</p>
<p class="bas indent1"><span class="nm">(a)</span><span class="cl">(Mishnah):</span> If Reuven piled up his Peros in Shimon's field without permission, and Shimon's animal ate them, Shimon is exempt;</p>
<p class="bas indent2"><span class="nm">1.</span>If the animal was damaged, Reuven is liable.</p>
<p class="bas indent2"><span class="nm">2.</span>If Reuven had permission, Shimon is liable.</p>
<p class="bas indent1"><span class="nm">(b)</span><span class="cl">(Gemara) Suggestion:</span> The Mishnah is unlike Rebbi, who holds that the owner of the premises is exempt, unless he accepted to guard.</p>
<p class="bas indent1"><span class="nm">(c)</span><span class="cl">Rejection (Rav Papa):</span> It is even like Rebbi. The case is, Reuven got permission from the guard hired to watch all the granaries in the valley. (Rashi agrees that Stam, he accepts to guard.)</p>
<p class="bas subject"><span class="nm">5)</span>SENDING A FIRE</p>
<p class="bas indent1"><span class="nm">(a)</span><span class="cl">(Mishnah):</span> If Reuven sent a fire with a Cheresh, lunatic or child, he is exempt b'Yedei Adam, but liable b'Yedei Shamayim.</p>
<p class="bas indent2"><span class="nm">1.</span>If he sent a fire with a healthy adult, the adult is liable.</p>
<p class="bas indent1"><span class="nm">(b)</span>If Shimon brought the flame, and Levi brought the wood, Levi is liable;</p>
<p class="bas indent1"><span class="nm">(c)</span>If Shimon brought the wood, and Levi brought the flame, Levi is liable;</p>
<p class="bas indent2"><span class="nm">1.</span>If Yehudah came and blew the flame, he is liable;</p>
<p class="bas indent2"><span class="nm">2.</span>If the wind fanned the flame, all are exempt.</p>
<p class="bas indent1"><span class="nm">(d)</span><span class="cl">(Gemara - Reish Lakish):</span> Reuven is exempt (b'Yedei Adam) only when he sent a coal with a Cheresh, lunatic or child, and the messenger fanned it. If he sent a flame, Beis Din makes him pay.</p>
<p class="bas indent2"><span class="nm">1.</span><span class="cl">Question:</span> Why is he liable if he sent a flame?</p>
<p class="bas indent2"><span class="nm">2.</span><span class="cl">Answer:</span> This will surely cause damage.</p>
<p class="bas indent1"><span class="nm">(e)</span><span class="cl">(R. Yochanan):</span> Even if he sent a flame, he is exempt.</p>
<p class="bas indent2"><span class="nm">1.</span><span class="cl">Question:</span> What is the reason?</p>
<p class="bas indent2"><span class="nm">2.</span><span class="cl">Answer:</span> The way the messenger held the flame caused the damage.</p>
<p class="bas indent1"><span class="nm">(f)</span>Reuven is liable only if he sent thorns, thin wood, and a lamp. Then, he surely caused the damage!</p>
