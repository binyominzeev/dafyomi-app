<p class="bas indent1"><span class="nm">(a)</span><span class="cl">Question:</span> What is the case of bending Reuven's crop in front of in a fire?</p>
<p class="bas indent2"><span class="nm">1.</span>If a normal wind can cause the fire to reach where he bent it, he is liable b'Yedei Adam !</p>
<p class="bas indent1"><span class="nm">(b)</span><span class="cl">Answer #1:</span> Rather, he bent it to where an abnormal wind can make the fire reach.</p>
<p class="bas indent1"><span class="nm">(c)</span><span class="cl">Answer #2 (Rav Ashi):</span> The case is, Shimon's fire was destined to burn Reuven's crop, and Levi covered it so it is hidden, and Shimon was exempt for it.</p>
<p class="bas indent1"><span class="nm">(d)</span><span class="cl">Question:</span> What is the case of hiring false witnesses?</p>
<p class="bas indent2"><span class="nm">1.</span>If he hired them for his own benefit, Beis Din makes him return what he improperly gained through them!</p>
<p class="bas indent1"><span class="nm">(e)</span><span class="cl">Answer:</span> Rather, he hired them to testify for Ploni (someone else, and we cannot make Ploni pay).</p>
<p class="bas indent1"><span class="nm">(f)</span><span class="cl">Question:</span> What is the case of not testifying when he knows testimony that could help Reuven?</p>
<p class="bas indent2"><span class="nm">1.</span>If another witness knows, the Torah explicitly holds him accountable b'Yedei Shamayim (for Reuven could collect through their testimony) - "if he will not testify, he will bear his sin"!</p>
<p class="bas indent1"><span class="nm">(g)</span><span class="cl">Answer:</span> Rather, no other witness knows. (Had he testified, Reuven's opponent would have needed to swear or pay. Perhaps he would have paid to avoid swearing.)</p>
<p class="bas indent1"><span class="nm">(h)</span><span class="cl">Question:</span> There are other cases!</p>
<p class="bas indent2"><span class="nm">1.</span><span class="cl">(Beraisa):</span> If Reuven did work with Shimon's red heifer, or with his water destined to be sanctified with ashes of a red heifer (this disqualifies them), he is exempt b'Yedei Adam, but liable b'Yedei Shamayim.</p>
<p class="bas indent2"><span class="nm">2.</span><span class="cl">(Beraisa):</span> If Levi put poison in front of Yehudah's animal, he is exempt b'Yedei Adam, but liable b'Yedei Shamayim.</p>
<p class="bas indent2"><span class="nm">3.</span><span class="cl">(Mishnah):</span> If Reuven sent a fire with a Cheresh, lunatic or child, he is exempt b'Yedei Adam, but liable b'Yedei Shamayim.</p>
<p class="bas indent2"><span class="nm">4.</span><span class="cl">(Beraisa):</span> If Reuven scared Shimon (and Shimon became deaf through this), he is exempt b'Yedei Adam, but liable b'Yedei Shamayim.</p>
<p class="bas indent2"><span class="nm">5.</span><span class="cl">(Beraisa - R. Meir):</span> If his jug broke and he did not clear away the fragments, his camel fell, and he did not stand it up, he is liable for damage that they caused;</p>
<p class="bas indent3"><span class="nm">i.</span>Chachamim say, he is exempt b'Yedei Adam and liable b'Yedei Shamayim.</p>
<p class="bas indent1"><span class="nm">(i)</span><span class="cl">Answer:</span> Indeed, there are more cases. R. Yehoshua taught these cases, for one might thought that he is exempt even b'Yedei Shamayim:</p>
<p class="bas indent2"><span class="nm">1.</span>He breached (in front of an animal) a wall that (was prone to fall, so) the owner was obligated to knock it down;</p>
<p class="bas indent2"><span class="nm">2.</span>One who bent Reuven's crop in front of a fire can say that he did not expect an abnormal wind;</p>
<p class="bas indent3"><span class="nm">i.</span>According to Rav Ashi, he covered the crop in an attempt to save it;</p>
<p class="bas indent2"><span class="nm">3.</span>One who hired false witnesses can say 'they should not have obeyed me to transgress Hash-m's Mitzvos!'</p>
<p class="bas indent2"><span class="nm">4.</span>One who did not testify can say 'perhaps it would not have helped, and your opponent would have sworn falsely.'</p>
<p class="bas indent2"><span class="nm">5.</span>R. Yehoshua teaches that this is not so. In all these cases, he is liable b'Yedei Shamayim.</p>
<p class="bas subject"><span class="nm">2)</span>ANIMALS THAT ESCAPED</p>
<p class="bas indent1"><span class="nm">(a)</span><span class="cl">(Mishnah):</span> If the wall broke at night, or if thieves broke it... (the owner is exempt).</p>
<p class="bas indent1"><span class="nm">(b)</span><span class="cl">(Rabah):</span> The case is, the animal tunneled under it (and broke the wall and left through the opening).</p>
<p class="bas indent1"><span class="nm">(c)</span><span class="cl">Inference:</span> Had it not tunneled, he would be liable.</p>
<p class="bas indent1"><span class="nm">(d)</span><span class="cl">Question:</span> What is the case?</p>
<p class="bas indent2"><span class="nm">1.</span>If the wall is strong, why should he be liable? What more could he do?!</p>
<p class="bas indent1"><span class="nm">(e)</span><span class="cl">Answer #1:</span> The wall is weak.</p>
<p class="bas indent1"><span class="nm">(f)</span><span class="cl">Question:</span> Why is he exempt when it tunneled? He was negligent at the beginning, and Ones at the end!</p>
<p class="bas indent2"><span class="nm">1.</span>This is like the opinion that exempts one who was negligent at the beginning and Ones at the end;</p>
<p class="bas indent2"><span class="nm">2.</span>According to the opinion that obligates, how can we answer?</p>
<p class="bas indent1"><span class="nm">(g)</span><span class="cl">Answer #2:</span> The wall is strong. He is exempt even if it did not tunnel. Rabah discussed the Seifa.</p>
<p class="bas indent2"><span class="nm">1.</span><span class="cl">(Seifa):</span> If Reuven left it in the sun... he is liable;</p>
<p class="bas indent2"><span class="nm">2.</span><span class="cl">(Rabah):</span> He is liable even if the animal tunneled under the wall.</p>
<p class="bas indent3"><span class="nm">i.</span>When the animal did not tunnel, obviously he is liable. It is all due to negligence;</p>
<p class="bas indent3"><span class="nm">ii.</span>When it tunneled, one might have thought that he was negligent to start and Ones at the end (and is exempt according to one opinion). Rabah teaches that this is not so. It is all due to negligence.</p>
<p class="bas indent3"><span class="nm">iii.</span><span class="cl">Question:</span> What is the reason?</p>
<p class="bas indent3"><span class="nm">iv.</span><span class="cl">Answer:</span> When one leaves it in the sun, it will do anything needed to escape.</p>

<p class="bas subject"><span class="nm">3)</span>CAUSING AN ANIMAL TO DO DAMAGE</p>
<p class="bas indent1"><span class="nm">(a)</span><span class="cl">(Mishnah):</span> If thieves took out an animal and it damaged, the thieves are liable.</p>
<p class="bas indent1"><span class="nm">(b)</span><span class="cl">Question:</span> This is obvious! Since they took it out, they are fully responsible for it!</p>
<p class="bas indent1"><span class="nm">(c)</span><span class="cl">Answer #1:</span> The case is, they did not take it out. They stood in front of it, and let it go only to the place where it damaged.</p>
<p class="bas indent2"><span class="nm">1.</span><span class="cl">(Rabah):</span> If Reuven put Shimon's animal in front of Levi's crop, he is liable.</p>
<p class="bas indent2"><span class="nm">2.</span><span class="cl">Question:</span> This is obvious!</p>
<p class="bas indent2"><span class="nm">3.</span><span class="cl">Answer #1:</span> The case is, he did not pull it. He stood in front of it, and let it go only to Levi's crop.</p>
<p class="bas indent2"><span class="nm">4.</span><span class="cl">Answer #2 (Abaye):</span> He hit it with a stick, causing it to go to Levi's crop.</p>
<p class="bas indent1"><span class="nm">(d)</span><span class="cl">Answer #2:</span> The thieves hit it with a stick, and thereby acquire it through Meshichah.</p>
<p class="bas subject"><span class="nm">4)</span>THE <i>SHOMER</i> IS LIKE THE OWNER</p>
<p class="bas indent1"><span class="nm">(a)</span><span class="cl">(Mishnah):</span> If Reuven handed his animal over to a shepherd (Shimon), Shimon is in his stead...</p>
<p class="bas indent1"><span class="nm">(b)</span><span class="cl">Question:</span> In whose stead is he?</p>
<p class="bas indent2"><span class="nm">1.</span>If he is in Reuven's stead, another Mishnah already teaches this!</p>
<p class="bas indent3"><span class="nm">i.</span><span class="cl">(Mishnah):</span> If he gave it over to a Shomer Chinam (one who guards a deposit for free), a borrower, a Shomer Sachar (he is paid to guard it), or renter, the Shomer is like the owner.</p>
<p class="bas indent1"><span class="nm">(c)</span><span class="cl">Answer:</span> Rather, if a Shomer (Levi) handed the animal over to Shimon, Shimon is in Levi's stead, and Levi is exempt.</p>
<p class="bas indent1"><span class="nm">(d)</span><span class="cl">Version #1 - Suggestion:</span> This refutes Rava!</p>
<p class="bas indent2"><span class="nm">1.</span><span class="cl">(Rava):</span> If a Shomer (Levi) handed over to another Shomer, Levi is liable.</p>
<p class="bas indent1"><span class="nm">(e)</span><span class="cl">Answer (for Rava):</span> The Mishnah discusses handing over to an apprentice shepherd. This is normal practice, so he is exempt.</p>
<p class="bas indent1"><span class="nm">(f)</span><span class="cl">Version #2:</span> The Mishnah says 'he handed over to a shepherd.' It does not say he handed over to 'another.' This suggests that he gave to his apprentice.</p>
<p class="bas indent1"><span class="nm">(g)</span><span class="cl">Inference:</span> Had he handed over to anyone else, he would be liable. This supports Rava.</p>
<p class="bas indent2"><span class="nm">1.</span><span class="cl">(Rava):</span> If a Shomer (Levi) handed over to another Shomer, Levi is liable.</p>
<p class="bas indent1"><span class="nm">(h)</span><span class="cl">Rejection:</span> Perhaps the Mishnah gave a typical case, but he is exempt even if he hands over to another.</p>
