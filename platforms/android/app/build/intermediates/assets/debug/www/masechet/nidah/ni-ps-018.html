<p class="bas subject"><span class="nm">1)</span>WHEN IS BLOOD ASSUMED TO BE TAMEI?</p>
<p class="bas indent1"><span class="nm">(a)</span>According to Rav Huna, R. Chiya and Rav Katina do not argue. R. Chiya's law applies when the blood was found inside the Lul, and Rav Katina's law is when it was found outside.</p>
<p class="bas indent1"><span class="nm">(b)</span>Rami bar Shmuel and Rav Yitzchak said that blood found inside is Safek Tamei, and blood found outside is Tahor. This can be like Rav Katina, if he discusses when the blood was found inside.</p>
<p class="bas indent1"><span class="nm">(c)</span><span class="cl">Suggestion:</span> We must say that they argue with R. Chiya!</p>
<p class="bas indent1"><span class="nm">(d)</span><span class="cl">Rejection:</span> No. R. Chiya discusses when blood was found on the floor of the Prozdor (the way it normally exits the Cheder), and they discuss when it was found on the ceiling.</p>
<p class="bas subject"><span class="nm">2)</span>FOLLOWING THE MAJORITY</p>
<p class="bas indent1"><span class="nm">(a)</span><span class="cl">(R. Yochanan):</span> In three places, Chachamim say that something definitely comes from the majority -- blood of the Makor (like we explained), a Shilya (fetal sac), and a piece (of an aborted fetus):</p>
<p class="bas indent2"><span class="nm">1.</span><span class="cl">(Mishnah):</span> (If a woman miscarried a Shilya and no child came out,) if the Shilya is in a house, the house is Tamei;</p>
<p class="bas indent3"><span class="nm">i.</span>A Shilya is not Metamei because it is considered a (dead) child. Rather, it is always accompanied by a child.</p>
<p class="bas indent3"><span class="nm">ii.</span>R. Shimon says, perhaps the child was dissolved before the Shilya left the mother (and the house is Tahor)!</p>
<p class="bas indent2"><span class="nm">2.</span><span class="cl">(Beraisa):</span> If a woman miscarried a hand or foot in which the fingers or toes are delineated, she is Teme'ah Yoledes. We are not concerned lest it came from an Atum body (the bottom is lacking, like we will explain on 23b).</p>
<p class="bas indent1"><span class="nm">(b)</span><span class="cl">Question:</span> In other places Chachamim also follow the majority absolutely!</p>
<p class="bas indent2"><span class="nm">1.</span><span class="cl">(Beraisa):</span> If nine stores in the city sell slaughtered meat and one sells Nevelah, and a man is not sure from which he bought, the meat is forbidden;</p>
<p class="bas indent2"><span class="nm">2.</span>If meat is found, we follow the majority.</p>
<p class="bas indent1"><span class="nm">(c)</span><span class="cl">Answer:</span> R. Yochanan discusses Tum'ah. (In only three cases of Tum'ah, Chachamim follow the majority absolutely.)</p>
<p class="bas indent1"><span class="nm">(d)</span><span class="cl">Question:</span> There is another case regarding Tum'ah!</p>
<p class="bas indent2"><span class="nm">1.</span><span class="cl">(Beraisa):</span> If one Sheretz was among nine frogs; and Reuven touched one of the ten and is unsure what he touched:</p>
<p class="bas indent3"><span class="nm">i.</span>If this Safek arose in Reshus ha'Yachid, he is deemed Tamei;</p>
<p class="bas indent3"><span class="nm">ii.</span>If it arose in Reshus ha'Rabim, he is deemed Tahor.</p>
<p class="bas indent2"><span class="nm">2.</span>If one Sheretz or frog was found and we cannot determine which of these it is, we follow the majority (in that area).</p>
<p class="bas indent1"><span class="nm">(e)</span><span class="cl">Answer:</span> R. Yochanan discusses Tum'ah of a woman.</p>
<p class="bas indent1"><span class="nm">(f)</span><span class="cl">Question:</span> There is also the following case!</p>
<p class="bas indent2"><span class="nm">1.</span><span class="cl">(R. Yehoshua ben Levi):</span> If a woman miscarried in a river, she brings a Korban (like a definite Yoledes). Kohanim eat the Chatas, for we follow the majority:</p>
<p class="bas bbbline">18b----------------------------------------18b</p>
<p class="bas indent2"><span class="nm">2.</span>Most women give birth to a proper child (for which a Korban is brought).</p>
<p class="bas indent1"><span class="nm">(g)</span><span class="cl">Answer:</span> R. Yochanan discusses Mishnayos and Beraisos, but not teachings of Amora'im.</p>
<p class="bas indent1"><span class="nm">(h)</span><span class="cl">Question:</span> Ravin said "R. Yosi b'Rebbi Chanina tried to refute R. Yehoshua ben Levi from the Beraisa (29b) about a woman who errs. I do not see the refutation!"</p>
<p class="bas indent2"><span class="nm">1.</span><span class="cl">Suggestion:</span> Rather, the Beraisa <i>supports</i> R. Yehoshua ben Levi! (R. Yochanan should have listed the Beraisa.)</p>
<p class="bas indent1"><span class="nm">(i)</span><span class="cl">Answer:</span> Perhaps it neither supports nor refutes R. Yehoshua ben Levi.</p>
<p class="bas indent1"><span class="nm">(j)</span><span class="cl">Question:</span> What did R. Yochanan come to exclude?</p>
<p class="bas indent1"><span class="nm">(k)</span><span class="cl">Answer #1:</span> When a Chazakah opposes the majority, we follow the majority, but we do not burn Terumah due to it.</p>
<p class="bas indent1"><span class="nm">(l)</span><span class="cl">Rejection:</span> R. Yochanan already taught this!</p>
<p class="bas indent2"><span class="nm">1.</span><span class="cl">(Mishnah - R. Meir):</span> If a (young) child is next to a dough, holding a piece of dough, the dough (next to him) is Tahor;</p>
<p class="bas indent2"><span class="nm">2.</span>Chachamim say, it is Tamei, because most children touch. (Rashi - most become Tamei through touching Sheratzim in the wasteheap. Surely, the child touched the dough to take a piece. Tosfos - all children are (Muchzakim to be) Teme'im, for Nidos hug them. Most play with dough. He probably touched it himself. We ignore the minority chance that someone else gave it to him.)</p>
<p class="bas indent2"><span class="nm">3.</span><span class="cl">Question:</span> What is R. Meir's reason?</p>
<p class="bas indent2"><span class="nm">4.</span><span class="cl">Answer:</span> Most children touch, and a minority do not. The dough has Chezkas Taharah.</p>
<p class="bas indent3"><span class="nm">i.</span>We combine the minority of children who do not touch with the Chazakah. This weakens the majority that touch. (We are left with a Safek in which Ein Da'as Lisha'el, i.e. the child is too young to be asked. It is Tahor even in Reshus ha'Yachid.)</p>
<p class="bas indent2"><span class="nm">5.</span>Chachamim disagree. We ignore the minority, and we follow the majority against a Chazakah.</p>
<p class="bas indent2"><span class="nm">6.</span><span class="cl">(Reish Lakish):</span> We burn Terumah based on such a majority.</p>
<p class="bas indent2"><span class="nm">7.</span><span class="cl">(R. Yochanan):</span> We do not burn Terumah based on such a majority.</p>
<p class="bas indent1"><span class="nm">(m)</span><span class="cl">Answer #2:</span> He excludes R. Yehudah's majority (regarding a miscarriage. Rashi - he teaches that R. Yehudah himself considers it a Safek. Rashba - he rules like Chachamim, who do not follow this majority.)</p>
<p class="bas indent2"><span class="nm">1.</span><span class="cl">(Mishnah):</span> If a woman miscarried a piece of flesh:</p>
<p class="bas indent3"><span class="nm">i.</span>If blood came out with it, she is Teme'ah. If not, she is Tehorah;</p>
<p class="bas indent2"><span class="nm">2.</span>R. Yehudah says, in either case she is Teme'ah.</p>
<p class="bas indent2"><span class="nm">3.</span><span class="cl">(Rav Yehudah):</span> R. Yehudah is Metamei (without blood) only if the flesh has the color of one of the four Tamei appearances of blood (Halachah considers the flesh like blood), otherwise he is Metaher.</p>
<p class="bas indent2"><span class="nm">4.</span><span class="cl">(R. Yochanan):</span> R. Yehudah and Chachamim agree that if the flesh is one of the four colors, she is a Nidah. If not, she is not;</p>
<p class="bas indent2"><span class="nm">5.</span>They argue when we do not know the color of the flesh;</p>
<p class="bas indent3"><span class="nm">i.</span>R. Yehudah follows the majority of women. When they miscarry flesh, it is one of the four colors. (Rashi - he is only stringent. She is Safek Nidah);</p>
<p class="bas indent3"><span class="nm">ii.</span>Chachamim do not follow this majority. (She is Tehorah.)</p>
