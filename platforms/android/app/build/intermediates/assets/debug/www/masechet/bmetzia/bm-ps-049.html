<p class="bas subject"><span class="nm">1)</span>HOW MUCH DOES A SECURITY ACQUIRE?</p>
<p class="bas indent1"><span class="nm">(a)</span><span class="cl">Suggestion:</span> Tana'im argue like Rav and R. Yochanan argue.</p>
<p class="bas indent2"><span class="nm">1.</span><span class="cl">(Beraisa - R. Shimon ben Gamliel):</span> If Reuven lent Shimon and he took a security at the time of the loan, and Shemitah came, even if the security is worth only half the loan, the loan is not cancelled;</p>
<p class="bas indent2"><span class="nm">2.</span>Rebbi says, the loan is not cancelled only if the security is worth the entire loan.</p>
<p class="bas indent2"><span class="nm">3.</span><span class="cl">Question:</span> R. Shimon said 'it is not cancelled.' What does this mean?</p>
<p class="bas indent3"><span class="nm">i.</span><span class="cl">Suggestion:</span> The value of the security is not cancelled.</p>
<p class="bas indent3"><span class="nm">ii.</span><span class="cl">Rejection:</span> If so, Rebbi holds that even this is cancelled. If so, why did he take a security?!</p>
<p class="bas indent2"><span class="nm">4.</span><span class="cl">Answer:</span> Rather, R. Shimon says that the entire loan is not cancelled, and Rebbi says that the value of the loan above the security is cancelled.</p>
<p class="bas indent3"><span class="nm">i.</span>R. Shimon holds that a security acquires fully, and Rebbi holds that it only acquires according to its value.</p>
<p class="bas indent1"><span class="nm">(b)</span><span class="cl">Rejection:</span> Really, R. Shimon means that the value of the security is not cancelled.</p>
<p class="bas indent1"><span class="nm">(c)</span><span class="cl">Question:</span> If so, Rebbi holds that even this is cancelled. Why did he take a security?!</p>
<p class="bas indent1"><span class="nm">(d)</span><span class="cl">Answer:</span> It is a commemoration of the loan.</p>
<p class="bas subject"><span class="nm">2)</span>KEEPING ONE'S WORD</p>
<p class="bas indent1"><span class="nm">(a)</span>Rav Kahana received partial payment for flax; the price went up.</p>
<p class="bas indent1"><span class="nm">(b)</span><span class="cl">Rav:</span> You must give flax according to the money you received. The agreement to sell the rest is mere words. One who retracts is not considered unfaithful.</p>
<p class="bas indent1"><span class="nm">(c)</span><span class="cl">(Rav):</span> One who retracts from an oral agreement is not considered unfaithful;</p>
<p class="bas indent1"><span class="nm">(d)</span><span class="cl">(R. Yochanan):</span> He is considered unfaithful.</p>
<p class="bas indent1"><span class="nm">(e)</span>Question (Beraisa - R. Yosi b'Rebbi Yehudah) Question: Why did the Torah need to write "Hin Tzedek"? (Hin and Eifah are measures of volume. One's measures must be accurate, lest he use them to swindle when buying or selling.) It already says "Eifah Tzedek"!</p>
<p class="bas indent2"><span class="nm">1.</span><span class="cl">Answer (R. Yosi):</span> This teaches that your 'Hen' and 'Lav' (when you say yes or no) must be just.</p>
<p class="bas indent1"><span class="nm">(f)</span><span class="cl">Answer (Abaye):</span> R. Yosi forbids saying something that he does not intend to fulfill. (However, one who intended to fulfill his word need not do so if circumstances (e.g. prices) change.)</p>
<p class="bas indent1"><span class="nm">(g)</span><span class="cl">Question (Beraisa - R. Shimon):</span> Chachamim said that a garment acquires a Dinar and a Dinar does not acquire a garment, and they do not force the seller to give it. However, they said 'He who punished the generations of the flood and the dispersion, the people of Sodom and Amora and the Mitzriyim at the sea, He will punish one who does not honor his word.'</p>
<p class="bas indent1"><span class="nm">(h)</span><span class="cl">Answer:</span> Tana'im argue about whether or not one must keep his word.</p>
<p class="bas indent2"><span class="nm">1.</span><span class="cl">(Mishnah):</span> A case occurred in which R. Yochanan ben Masya told his son to hire workers. His son promised to feed them.</p>
<p class="bas indent2"><span class="nm">2.</span><span class="cl">R. Yochanan:</span> They descend from Avraham, Yitzchak and Yakov. Even if you give them a banquet like Shlomo used to make, this does not suffice! Before they start working, tell them that you promise them only bread and beans.</p>
<p class="bas indent2"><span class="nm">3.</span>If one who retracts is considered unfaithful, how could he tell his son to retract?</p>
<p class="bas indent1"><span class="nm">(i)</span><span class="cl">Rejection:</span> That case is different. The workers themselves did not rely on the promise.</p>
<p class="bas indent2"><span class="nm">1.</span><span class="cl">Question:</span> What is the reason?</p>
<p class="bas indent2"><span class="nm">2.</span><span class="cl">Answer:</span> They knew that the son did not promise to feed them himself, rather he relied on his father.</p>
<p class="bas indent2"><span class="nm">3.</span><span class="cl">Question:</span> If so, why did he need to retract before they started?</p>
<p class="bas indent2"><span class="nm">4.</span><span class="cl">Answer:</span> The workers would assume that the father heard his son's promise and agreed to fulfill it.</p>
<p class="bas indent1"><span class="nm">(j)</span><span class="cl">Question:</span> Did R. Yochanan really say that one who retracts from an oral agreement is considered unfaithful?</p>
<p class="bas indent2"><span class="nm">1.</span><span class="cl">Contradiction (Rabah bar bar Chanah citing R. Yochanan):</span> If Reuven promised to give a gift to Shimon, he can retract.</p>
<p class="bas indent2"><span class="nm">2.</span><span class="cl">Objection:</span> This is obvious!</p>
<p class="bas indent2"><span class="nm">3.</span><span class="cl">Correction:</span> Rather, he is fully permitted to retract.</p>
<p class="bas indent1"><span class="nm">(k)</span><span class="cl">Answer (Rav Papa):</span> R. Yochanan (permits retracting only from a large gift, for Shimon is not confident of receiving it. He) forbids retracting from a promise for a small gift.</p>
<p class="bas indent1"><span class="nm">(l)</span><span class="cl">Support:</span> R. Avahu cited R. Yochanan to say that if a Yisrael (Reuven) told a Levi (Moshe) 'I have a Kor of Ma'aser for you', Moshe may make it Terumas Ma'aser on other Ma'aser. (This is like a small gift, for Reuven owns only the right to give the Ma'aser to the Levi of his choice.)</p>
<p class="bas indent2"><span class="nm">1.</span>This is reasonable if Reuven may not retract. But if he may retract, perhaps he retracted, and the Terumas Ma'aser is invalid, and Moshe will eat Ma'aser that is Tevel!</p>
<p class="bas indent1"><span class="nm">(m)</span><span class="cl">Rejection:</span> The case is, Moshe took the Ma'aser, and deposited it back with Reuven.</p>
<p class="bas indent1"><span class="nm">(n)</span><span class="cl">Objection:</span> R. Avahu's teaching continues 'if Reuven gave it to a different Levi, Moshe only has complaints against Reuven.' If Moshe took it, it is his!</p>
<p class="bas indent1"><span class="nm">(o)</span><span class="cl">Conclusion:</span> This is a proper support. Reuven may not retract.</p>
<p class="bas subject"><span class="nm">3)</span>WHO CAN RETRACT FROM A SALE?</p>
<p class="bas indent1"><span class="nm">(a)</span>A case occurred in which Reuven gave Shimon money for sesame, and the price went up. Shimon retracted and said 'I don't have sesame. Take your money back.' Reuven did not take his money; it was stolen.</p>
<p class="bas indent2"><span class="nm">1.</span><span class="cl">Rava:</span> Once he told you to take your money (and you left it with him), he is not a Shomer Sachar, so he is exempt. Further, he is not even a Shomer Chinam (he would be exempt even for negligence)!</p>
<p class="bas indent2"><span class="nm">2.</span><span class="cl">Rabanan:</span> Shimon must accept the curse 'He who punished...'!</p>
<p class="bas indent2"><span class="nm">3.</span><span class="cl">Rava:</span> Indeed, if he will not give the sesame, he must accept it.</p>
<p class="bas indent1"><span class="nm">(b)</span><span class="cl">Rav Papi citing Rav Tavos:</span> I was the seller in that story, but it was not like reported. I would not retract my word for all the money in the world!</p>
<p class="bas indent2"><span class="nm">1.</span>Rather, Reuven came to me just before Shabbos, and asking to buy sesame. I refused. He asked to deposit his money with me, for Shabbos was coming. I said 'you can put it anywhere in my house that you want.' He put it in the house, and it was stolen.</p>
<p class="bas bbbline">49b----------------------------------------49b</p>
<p class="bas indent2"><span class="nm">2.</span>Rava ruled that not only I was not a Shomer Sachar, rather, I was not even a Shomer Chinam!</p>
<p class="bas indent1"><span class="nm">(c)</span><span class="cl">Question:</span> Rabanan said that 'he must accept the curse!'</p>
<p class="bas indent1"><span class="nm">(d)</span><span class="cl">Answer (Rav Tavos):</span> They said no such thing.</p>
<p class="bas indent1"><span class="nm">(e)</span><span class="cl">(Mishnah - R. Shimon):</span> Whoever is holding the money has the upper hand.</p>
<p class="bas indent1"><span class="nm">(f)</span><span class="cl">(Beraisa - R. Shimon):</span> This is when the seller has the money and the Peros. If the seller has the money and the buyer has the Peros, he (the seller) cannot retract because his money is in his (the buyer's) hand.</p>
<p class="bas indent1"><span class="nm">(g)</span><span class="cl">Question:</span> What does this mean? The money is in the <i>seller's</i> hand!</p>
<p class="bas indent1"><span class="nm">(h)</span><span class="cl">Answer:</span> It means 'he cannot retract because what is in exchange for his money (i.e. the Peros) is in the buyer's hand.'</p>
<p class="bas indent1"><span class="nm">(i)</span><span class="cl">Objection:</span> Obviously, he cannot retract! (Meshichah was done!)</p>
<p class="bas indent1"><span class="nm">(j)</span><span class="cl">Answer (Rava):</span> The case is, the seller was renting the buyer's attic (where the Peros were. Rashi - therefore, the buyer did not acquire through his premises.)</p>
<p class="bas indent2"><span class="nm">1.</span>Chachamim enacted that Meshichah acquires (and not money), lest someone sell something in his attic, a fire will erupt, and he will not strive to save it;</p>
<p class="bas indent2"><span class="nm">2.</span>Here, the Peros are in the buyer's attic. If there is a fire, the buyer will strive to save them (so there is no need for the enactment)!</p>
<p class="bas indent1"><span class="nm">(k)</span>A case occurred in which Reuven paid money for wine. He heard that a powerful official of the king was marrying off a child. (Surely, he would confiscate people's wine for this.) Reuven retracted.</p>
<p class="bas indent1"><span class="nm">(l)</span><span class="cl">Rav Chisda:</span> Just like Meshichah was enacted for sellers (that they can retract until Meshichah is done), also for buyers.</p>
<p class="bas subject"><span class="nm">4)</span>ONA'AH</p>
<p class="bas indent1"><span class="nm">(a)</span><span class="cl">(Mishnah):</span> (The threshold of) Ona'ah (the amount one must overpay to be able to force the seller to return the overcharge) is four Ma'os (one Ma'ah is a sixth of a Dinar) out of 24 Ma'os (a Sela), a sixth of the purchase;</p>
<p class="bas indent1"><span class="nm">(b)</span>(The buyer) can demand (return of the overcharge) until the time needed to show what he bought to a merchant or relative (who would tell him that he overpaid. If he delayed longer than this, he pardoned the Ona'ah.)</p>
<p class="bas indent1"><span class="nm">(c)</span>R. Tarfon ruled in Lud that (the threshold of) Ona'ah is eight Ma'os, i.e. a third of the purchase. The merchants rejoiced.</p>
<p class="bas indent2"><span class="nm">1.</span>He told them that one may claim the Ona'ah the entire day. They reverted to conduct like Chachamim (regarding both the threshold of Ona'ah and the time to claim it).</p>
<p class="bas indent1"><span class="nm">(d)</span><span class="cl">(Gemara - Rav):</span> The Mishnah refers to a sixth of the value of the item sold;</p>
<p class="bas indent1"><span class="nm">(e)</span><span class="cl">(Shmuel):</span> It also refers to a sixth of the money paid.</p>
<p class="bas indent1"><span class="nm">(f)</span>If the value was six, and it was sold for five or seven, all agree that (the law of) Ona'ah applies (the overcharge or undercharge must be returned). They argue when he paid six and it was worth five or seven.</p>
<p class="bas indent2"><span class="nm">1.</span>Shmuel holds that since the overcharge or undercharge is a sixth of the price, Ona'ah applies;</p>
<p class="bas indent2"><span class="nm">2.</span>Rav holds that we always calculate based on the value of the item. If he paid six and it was worth five, (the overcharge is more than a sixth), so the sale is void. If he paid six and it was worth seven (he underpaid less than a sixth), so the undercharge is pardoned.</p>
<p class="bas indent2"><span class="nm">3.</span>Shmuel says, the sale is void or the Ona'ah is pardoned only when it is not a sixth from either perspective.</p>
<p class="bas indent1"><span class="nm">(g)</span><span class="cl">Question (against Rav - Mishnah):</span> Ona'ah is four Ma'os out of 24, a sixth of the purchase;</p>
<p class="bas indent2"><span class="nm">1.</span><span class="cl">Suggestion:</span> He paid 24 for something worth 20. Ona'ah also applies to an overcharge that is a sixth of the price!</p>
<p class="bas indent1"><span class="nm">(h)</span><span class="cl">Answer #1:</span> No, he paid 20 for something worth 24.</p>
<p class="bas indent1"><span class="nm">(i)</span><span class="cl">Objection:</span> If so, the seller was underpaid. The Mishnah continues 'he told them that the Ona'ah can be claimed the entire day';</p>
<p class="bas indent2"><span class="nm">1.</span><span class="cl">(Rav Nachman):</span> This only refers to the buyer, but the seller can always claim the Ona'ah.</p>
<p class="bas indent1"><span class="nm">(j)</span><span class="cl">Answer #2:</span> Rather, he paid 28 and it was worth 24.</p>
<p class="bas indent1"><span class="nm">(k)</span><span class="cl">Support (for Shmuel - Beraisa):</span> Whoever was deceived has the upper hand:</p>
<p class="bas indent2"><span class="nm">1.</span>If the seller charged six for something worth five, the buyer has the upper hand. He can demand all his money back (voiding the sale), or the overcharge (and the sale stands).</p>
<p class="bas indent2"><span class="nm">2.</span>If he charged five for something worth six, the seller has the upper hand. He can demand the item back, or the undercharge.</p>
