<p class="bas subject"><span class="nm">1)</span>WHAT IS CALLED <i>PROPERTY?</i></p>
<p class="bas indent1"><span class="nm">(a)</span>Animals are called 'property';</p>
<p class="bas indent2"><span class="nm">1.</span><span class="cl">(Mishnah):</span> If Reuven was Makdish his property and it included animals fitting for Korbanos, males are Olah offerings, and females are sold to people who want to bring Shelamim,</p>
<p class="bas indent1"><span class="nm">(b)</span>Birds are called 'property';</p>
<p class="bas indent2"><span class="nm">1.</span><span class="cl">(Mishnah):</span> If Reuven was Makdish his property and it included things fitting for the Altar: wine, oil and birds...</p>
<p class="bas indent1"><span class="nm">(c)</span>Tefilin are called 'property';</p>
<p class="bas indent2"><span class="nm">1.</span><span class="cl">(Mishnah):</span> If Reuven was Makdish his property, he redeems them for their value.</p>
<p class="bas indent1"><span class="nm">(d)</span><span class="cl">Question:</span> Is a Sefer Torah called 'property'?</p>
<p class="bas indent2"><span class="nm">1.</span>Since one may not sell it, it is not called 'property';</p>
<p class="bas indent2"><span class="nm">2.</span>Or, since one may sell it to learn Torah or marry a wife, it is called 'property.'</p>
<p class="bas indent1"><span class="nm">(e)</span>This question is unsettled.</p>
<p class="bas subject"><span class="nm">2)</span>RETRACTING FROM A GIFT</p>
<p class="bas indent1"><span class="nm">(a)</span>Rav Zutra bar Tuvya's mother wrote her property to him before marrying Rav Zevid (so Rav Zevid would not get her property). He divorced her.</p>
<p class="bas indent2"><span class="nm">1.</span><span class="cl">Rav Bivi bar Abaye:</span> She gave to him the property because she wanted to get married, and she did!</p>
<p class="bas indent2"><span class="nm">2.</span><span class="cl">Rav Huna brei d'Rav Yehoshua:</span> Even according to the opinion that a Mavrachas document acquires, that is only when she did not reveal why she gives the property;</p>
<p class="bas indent3"><span class="nm">i.</span>Here, she said that it was because she wanted to marry. Now that she is divorced, all agree that she gets back the property.</p>
<p class="bas indent1"><span class="nm">(b)</span>Rami bar Chama's mother wrote her property to him at night, and to Rav Ukva bar Chama the next morning. (Later, she died.) Rav Sheshes established the property with Rami.</p>
<p class="bas indent2"><span class="nm">1.</span>Rav Ukva bar Chama went to Rav Nachman. He established the property with Rav Ukva.</p>
<p class="bas indent2"><span class="nm">2.</span><span class="cl">Rav Sheshes (to Rav Nachman):</span> Why did you do that?</p>
<p class="bas indent3"><span class="nm">i.</span>You cannot say it is because she retracted. She died!</p>
<p class="bas indent2"><span class="nm">3.</span><span class="cl">Rav Nachman:</span> Shmuel taught that anyone who could retract if he recovered, he can retract even if he did not recover. (Since she wrote to Rav Ukva, this shows that she retracted from giving to Rami.)</p>
<p class="bas indent2"><span class="nm">4.</span><span class="cl">Rav Sheshes:</span> Shmuel said so regarding retracting to take back the property for himself. Did he say so in order to give it to someone else?!</p>
<p class="bas indent2"><span class="nm">5.</span><span class="cl">Rav Nachman:</span> Yes, he explicitly said 'he may retract to take back the property for himself, or to give to someone else'.</p>
<p class="bas indent1"><span class="nm">(c)</span>Rav Amram Chasida's mother had loan documents. When she died, she said 'they are to my son Amram.'</p>
<p class="bas indent2"><span class="nm">1.</span><span class="cl">Amram's brothers:</span> He did not do Meshichah!</p>
<p class="bas indent2"><span class="nm">2.</span><span class="cl">Rav Nachman:</span> Words of a Shechiv Mera are like a document that was given. (Meshichah is not needed.)</p>
<p class="bas indent1"><span class="nm">(d)</span>Rav Tuvi bar Rav Masnah's sister wrote her property to Rav Tuvi in the morning. His brother Rav Achdevoy came to her that afternoon, crying.</p>
<p class="bas indent2"><span class="nm">1.</span><span class="cl">Rav Achdevoy:</span> People will say that he is a Chacham, and I am not!</p>
<p class="bas indent2"><span class="nm">2.</span>She wrote the property to him. He came in front of Rav Nachman.</p>
<p class="bas indent2"><span class="nm">3.</span><span class="cl">Rav Nachman:</span> Shmuel taught that anyone who could retract if he recovered, he can retract even if he did not recover (Rav Achdevoy gets the property).</p>
<p class="bas indent1"><span class="nm">(e)</span>Rav Dimi bar Yosef's sister had a small orchard. Whenever she got sick, she would give it to him. When she recovered, she would retract.</p>
<p class="bas bbbline">151b----------------------------------------151b</p>
<p class="bas indent2"><span class="nm">1.</span>Once, she got sick and called him to come to acquire it. He sent a message 'I am not interested.' She sent to him 'come and acquire it however you want (i.e. in a way that will not allow me to retract).'</p>
<p class="bas indent2"><span class="nm">2.</span>He left part for her, and made a Kinyan on the rest. She recovered and retracted, and came in front of Rav Nachman. He called Rav Dimi to come.</p>
<p class="bas indent2"><span class="nm">3.</span>Rav Dimi saw no need to come. Since she kept part, it was like a healthy person's gift, and he acquired!</p>
<p class="bas indent2"><span class="nm">4.</span><span class="cl">Rav Nachman:</span> If you do not come, I will put you in Cherem!</p>
<p class="bas indent3"><span class="nm">i.</span>When she had heard that Rav Dimi did not want to come, she said 'woe, I will die without seeing him.'</p>
<p class="bas indent2"><span class="nm">5.</span><span class="cl">Rav Nachman:</span> This shows that the gift was because she expected to die. Therefore, she may retract.</p>
<p class="bas subject"><span class="nm">3)</span>WHEN IS A KINYAN REQUIRED?</p>
<p class="bas indent1"><span class="nm">(a)</span><span class="cl">(Rabanan citing Rav Nachman):</span> A partial Matnas Shechiv Mera (he kept some property) is like a gift of a healthy person, and like a gift of a Shechiv Mera:</p>
<p class="bas indent2"><span class="nm">1.</span>It is like a gift of a healthy person. If the giver recovers, he cannot retract;</p>
<p class="bas indent2"><span class="nm">2.</span>It is like a gift of a Shechiv Mera. It does not require a Kinyan.</p>
<p class="bas indent1"><span class="nm">(b)</span><span class="cl">(Rava citing Rav Nachman):</span> No, it is (totally) like a gift of a healthy person. It needs a Kinyan.</p>
<p class="bas indent1"><span class="nm">(c)</span><span class="cl">Question (Rava - Mishnah):</span> If a Shechiv Mera gave a gift, and kept some property, if he recovers, he cannot retract.</p>
<p class="bas indent2"><span class="nm">1.</span><span class="cl">Suggestion:</span> This is when no Kinyan was made.</p>
<p class="bas indent1"><span class="nm">(d)</span><span class="cl">Answer:</span> No, a Kinyan was made.</p>
<p class="bas indent1"><span class="nm">(e)</span><span class="cl">Question (Rava - Seifa):</span> If he did not keep any property, if he recovers, he can retract.</p>
<p class="bas indent2"><span class="nm">1.</span>If a Kinyan was made, why can he retract?</p>
<p class="bas indent1"><span class="nm">(f)</span><span class="cl">Answer (Rav Nachman citing Shmuel):</span> If a Shechiv Mera gave all his property to others, even if they acquired from him, if he recovers, he can retract;</p>
<p class="bas indent2"><span class="nm">1.</span>Surely, he gave only because he expected to die.</p>
<p class="bas indent1"><span class="nm">(g)</span><span class="cl">Question (Rav Mesharshiya - Mishnah):</span> A case occurred in which the mother of Benei Rochel was sick. She said 'give my clasp to my daughter. It is worth 1200 Zuz.' The mother died, and Chachamim fulfilled her words.</p>
<p class="bas indent1"><span class="nm">(h)</span><span class="cl">Answer (Rava):</span> There, she gave only because she expected to die.</p>
<p class="bas indent1"><span class="nm">(i)</span><span class="cl">Question (Ravina - Mishnah):</span> If Reuven said 'give this Get to my wife and this Get of freedom to my slave', and he died, we do not give the Get posthumously;</p>
<p class="bas indent2"><span class="nm">1.</span>If he said 'give 100 Zuz to Ploni', and he died, we give it posthumously.</p>
<p class="bas indent2"><span class="nm">2.</span><span class="cl">Question:</span> Why can't we answer that a Kinyan was made?</p>
<p class="bas indent2"><span class="nm">3.</span><span class="cl">Answer:</span> Presumably, the Seifa is like the Reisha. Just like one cannot acquire the Get for her (unless she appointed him to be a Shali'ach, for a Get is detrimental for her), no one acquired the money for Ploni.</p>
<p class="bas indent1"><span class="nm">(j)</span><span class="cl">Answer (Rava):</span> There, Reuven gave only because he expected to die.</p>
<p class="bas indent1"><span class="nm">(k)</span><span class="cl">(Rav Huna brei d'Rav Yehoshua):</span> Normally, one who gives only because he expects to die must make a Kinyan;</p>
<p class="bas indent2"><span class="nm">1.</span>These Beraisos that do not require a Kinyan discuss one who gave away all his property. Then, it is like a Matnas Shechiv Mera.</p>
<p class="bas indent1"><span class="nm">(l)</span>The Halachah is, a partial Matnas Shechiv Mera requires a Kinyan, even if he died;</p>
<p class="bas indent2"><span class="nm">1.</span>One who gave only because he expected to die does not require a Kinyan, on condition that the giver died.</p>
<p class="bas indent2"><span class="nm">2.</span>If he recovered, he can retract, even though a Kinyan was made.</p>
