<p class="bas subject"><span class="nm">1)</span>WHEN IS <i>MIS'ASEK</i> EXEMPT?</p>
<p class="bas indent1"><span class="nm">(a)</span><span class="cl">Question (R. Oshaya, against Shmuel):</span> (If R. Yehudah discusses Ibed Melaket mi'Libo, presumably the previous clause also does!)</p>
<p class="bas indent2"><span class="nm">1.</span><span class="cl">(Mishnah - R. Shimon (and R. Shimon Shezuri)):</span> R. Eliezer and R. Yehoshua agree that if both Melachos have the same Shem, he brings a Chatas;</p>
<p class="bas indent2"><span class="nm">2.</span>They argue about when they are different Shemos Melachah. R. Eliezer is Mechayev Chatas, and R. Yehoshua exempts.</p>
<p class="bas indent2"><span class="nm">3.</span><span class="cl">Question:</span> R. Yehudah says that they argue about one who picked figs in place of grapes, or black in place of white. This is two Shemos, just like R. Shimon!</p>
<p class="bas indent2"><span class="nm">4.</span><span class="cl">Answer:</span> They argue about Mis'asek. R. Yehudah says that both are Mechayev (in a case of one Shem), and R. Shimon says that both exempt (unlike Shmuel)!</p>
<p class="bas indent1"><span class="nm">(b)</span><span class="cl">Answer #1:</span> No, all exempt Mis'asek;</p>
<p class="bas indent2"><span class="nm">1.</span>R. Shimon obligates in a case of one Shem, and says that they argue about two Shemos. R. Yehudah says that they argue even about one Shem (e.g. different colors. Above, we considered this two Shemos.)</p>
<p class="bas indent1"><span class="nm">(c)</span><span class="cl">Answer #2 (Rava):</span> They argue about one who did two Melachos, but not in the order he intended:</p>
<p class="bas indent2"><span class="nm">1.</span><span class="cl">(Beraisa):</span> In the following cases, Reuven is exempt:</p>
<p class="bas indent3"><span class="nm">i.</span>Two lamps were lit. He wanted to extinguish A but extinguished B instead;</p>
<p class="bas indent3"><span class="nm">ii.</span>Neither was lit. He wanted to light A, but lit B instead. (This is like our text. Some texts say that he is liable. R. Gershom - if he wanted to extinguish (or light) both, A before B, but did B before A, he is liable.)</p>
<p class="bas indent2"><span class="nm">2.</span>If only one was lit, and he wanted to light the second and then extinguish the first, but he extinguished and then lit:</p>
<p class="bas indent3"><span class="nm">i.</span>If he did so in one breath (surely, he did both simultaneously), he is liable. If he did so in two breaths, he is exempt.</p>
<p class="bas indent2"><span class="nm">3.</span><span class="cl">Objection:</span> This is obvious!</p>
<p class="bas indent2"><span class="nm">4.</span><span class="cl">Answer:</span> One might have thought that even in one breath he is exempt, for perhaps he did the opposite of his intent, i.e. he extinguished first;</p>
<p class="bas indent3"><span class="nm">i.</span>Rava teaches that this is not so. Granted, he did not light first, but he did not light after. (He lit and extinguished at once. This does not exempt.)</p>
<p class="bas indent1"><span class="nm">(d)</span><span class="cl">(Beraisa):</span> If one took coals from a pile (Rashi - and filled a bucket; R. Gershom - and dumped them on the floor) on Shabbos, he brings a Chatas;</p>
<p class="bas indent1"><span class="nm">(e)</span>R. Eliezer bar Tzadok says, he brings two Chata'os, for extinguishing the top coals (they are now on bottom) and igniting the lower coals (they are now on top).</p>
<p class="bas indent1"><span class="nm">(f)</span><span class="cl">Question:</span> What is the case?</p>
<p class="bas indent2"><span class="nm">1.</span>If he intended to extinguish and ignite, why does the first Tana obligate only once?!</p>
<p class="bas indent1"><span class="nm">(g)</span><span class="cl">Answer #1:</span> He intended only to extinguish.</p>
<p class="bas indent1"><span class="nm">(h)</span><span class="cl">Objection:</span> If so, why does R. Eliezer obligate twice?!</p>
<p class="bas indent1"><span class="nm">(i)</span><span class="cl">Answer #2 (R. Elazar and R. Chanina):</span> He intended to extinguish the top coals (to make Pechamim, i.e. (something that catches fire easily), in order to (more precisely - even though this will) ignite the lower coals;</p>
<p class="bas indent2"><span class="nm">1.</span>The first Tana exempts Mekalkel b'Hav'arah (non-constructive burning). R. Eliezer is Mechayev.</p>
<p class="bas indent2"><span class="nm">2.</span><span class="cl">Support (R. Yochanan):</span> The case is, he is a smith (who needs Pechamim. He does not want the lower coals to burn).</p>
<p class="bas indent2"><span class="nm">3.</span><span class="cl">R. Yirmeyah:</span> Only now we learned to explain this Beraisa!</p>
<p class="bas indent1"><span class="nm">(j)</span><span class="cl">Answer #3 (Ami bar Avin and Rav Chanina bar Avin):</span> He intended to extinguish and ignite;</p>
<p class="bas bbbline">20b----------------------------------------20b</p>
<p class="bas indent2"><span class="nm">1.</span>The first Tana holds like R. Yosi, who says that (a verse specifically forbids burning on Shabbos, for) burning is only a Lav. (It is not a Melachah.)</p>
<p class="bas indent2"><span class="nm">2.</span>R. Eliezer holds like R. Nasan, who says that burning was singled out Lechalek. (It teaches that one is liable for each Melachah by itself, just like he is liable for burning.)</p>
<p class="bas indent1"><span class="nm">(k)</span><span class="cl">Answer #4 (Rava):</span> They argue about one who wanted to do these Melachos in a particular order (Minchas Bikurim on Tosefta Shabbos 2:5 - but he did them at the same time. The first Tana obligates once, like above, for they were not done in the opposite order. R. Eliezer is Mechayev twice, for the order does not matter.)</p>
<p class="bas indent1"><span class="nm">(l)</span><span class="cl">Answer #5 (Rav Ashi):</span> The case is, he intended only to extinguish. The bottom coals flared up on their own;</p>
<p class="bas indent2"><span class="nm">1.</span>The first Tana holds like R. Shimon, who exempts Davar she'Eino Miskaven (something one did not intend to do). R. Eliezer holds like R. Yehudah, who is Mechayev for a Davar she'Eino Miskaven.</p>
<p class="bas indent1"><span class="nm">(m)</span><span class="cl">(Beraisa #1):</span> If one filled a bucket of coals on Shabbos for the sake of warmth, and they flared up by themselves, he is liable;</p>
<p class="bas indent1"><span class="nm">(n)</span><span class="cl">(Beraisa #2):</span> He is exempt.</p>
<p class="bas indent2"><span class="nm">1.</span>Tana #1 is Mechayev for a Melachah she'Einah Tzerichah l'Gufah (he does not benefit from it, e.g. they would give warmth even without flaring up; Tosfos Shabbos 94a - the Melachah is done for a different purpose than in the Mishkan). Tana #2 exempts.</p>
<p class="perekline">PEREK DAM SHECHITAH</p>
<p class="bas subject"><span class="nm">2)</span>LIABILITY FOR EATING BLOOD</p>
<p class="bas indent1"><span class="nm">(a)</span><span class="cl">(Mishnah):</span> One is Chayav (Kares or Korban) for eating Dam ha'Nefesh (blood that exudes at the time of death) of a Tamei or Tahor Behemah, Chayah or fowl, whether it came from Shechitah, Nechirah (he cut or tore the Simanim lengthwise), (Tosfos - Shechitah done after) Ikur (uprooting the Simanim from the mouth), or bloodletting;</p>
<p class="bas indent1"><span class="nm">(b)</span>One is exempt for blood of the spleen, heart, Beitzim (eggs; alternatively - testicles), grasshoppers, and Dam Tamtzis (that exudes before or after Dam ha'Nefesh);</p>
<p class="bas indent1"><span class="nm">(c)</span>R. Yehudah is Mechayev for Dam Tamtzis.</p>
<p class="bas indent1"><span class="nm">(d)</span><span class="cl">(Gemara - Beraisa) Suggestion:</span> Perhaps "v'Chol Dam Lo Sochlu" includes even blood of people, Beitzim, grasshoppers, and fish!</p>
<p class="bas indent2"><span class="nm">1.</span><span class="cl">Rejection:</span> The Torah forbids "la'Of vela'Behemah." Birds and Behemos have light Tum'ah (Tum'as Ochlim) and severe Tum'ah (their Nevelos can be Metamei a person and his clothes), they are (initially) forbidden but can become permitted (through Shechitah), and they are meat. The Isur of Dam applies to everything with all these qualities;</p>
<p class="bas indent2"><span class="nm">2.</span>The following bloods are excluded;</p>
<p class="bas indent3"><span class="nm">i.</span>Of people, for they have only severe Tum'ah; but not light Tum'ah; of Sheratzim, for they lack severe Tum'ah; of eggs, for they are not meat; of fish and grasshoppers, for they are totally permitted (even without Shechitah).</p>
