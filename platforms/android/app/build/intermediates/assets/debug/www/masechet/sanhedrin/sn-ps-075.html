<p class="bas subject"><span class="nm">1)</span>DISTANCING ONE'S SELF FROM PROHIBITED BI'AH</p>
<p class="bas indent1"><span class="nm">(a)</span><span class="cl">(Rav Yehudah):</span> A case occurred in which a man was eyeing a woman. He became sick due to desire for her. Doctors said that he will recover only if he has Bi'ah with her.</p>
<p class="bas indent2"><span class="nm">1.</span><span class="cl">Rabanan:</span> It is forbidden, even if he will die.</p>
<p class="bas indent2"><span class="nm">2.</span><span class="cl">Doctors:</span> Let her stand naked in front of him (perhaps this will help)!</p>
<p class="bas indent2"><span class="nm">3.</span><span class="cl">Rabanan:</span> It is forbidden, even if he will die.</p>
<p class="bas indent2"><span class="nm">4.</span><span class="cl">Doctors:</span> Let her talk with him in back of the fence.</p>
<p class="bas indent2"><span class="nm">5.</span><span class="cl">Rabanan:</span> It is forbidden, even if he will die.</p>
<p class="bas indent1"><span class="nm">(b)</span><span class="cl">(R. Yakov bar Idi or R. Shmuel bar Nachmani):</span> She was married.</p>
<p class="bas indent1"><span class="nm">(c)</span><span class="cl">(The other of R. Yakov bar Idi and R. Shmuel bar Nachmani):</span> She was single.</p>
<p class="bas indent1"><span class="nm">(d)</span><span class="cl">Question:</span> According to the first opinion, we understand why Rabanan were so stringent;</p>
<p class="bas indent2"><span class="nm">1.</span>However, if she was single, why were they so stringent?</p>
<p class="bas indent1"><span class="nm">(e)</span><span class="cl">Answer #1 (Rav Papa):</span> It would have been embarrassing to her family.</p>
<p class="bas indent1"><span class="nm">(f)</span><span class="cl">Answer #2 (Rav Acha brei d'Rav Ika):</span> Had they been lenient, this would have degraded the Kedushah of Bnos Yisrael (they would stand in front of men, and be allowed to have Bi'ah with them).</p>
<p class="bas indent1"><span class="nm">(g)</span><span class="cl">Question:</span> Why didn't he marry her?</p>
<p class="bas indent1"><span class="nm">(h)</span><span class="cl">Answer:</span> That would not have satisfied his desire.</p>
<p class="bas indent2"><span class="nm">1.</span><span class="cl">(R. Yitzchak):</span> After the Churban, full enjoyment of Bi'ah is only experienced when it is forbidden - "Mayim Genuvim Yimtaku."</p>

<p class="bas subject"><span class="nm">2)</span>AVEIROS OF <i>SEREIFAH</i></p>
<p class="bas indent1"><span class="nm">(a)</span><span class="cl">(Mishnah):</span> The following are burned:</p>
<p class="bas indent2"><span class="nm">1.</span>A man who has Bi'ah with a woman and her daughter;</p>
<p class="bas indent2"><span class="nm">2.</span>A Bas Kohen who is Mezanah.</p>
<p class="bas indent1"><span class="nm">(b)</span>'A man who has Bi'ah with a woman and her daughter' includes one who has Bi'ah with his daughter or granddaughter (from his son or daughter), or his wife's daughter or granddaughter, or his mother-in-law, or either grandmother of his wife.</p>
<p class="bas indent1"><span class="nm">(c)</span><span class="cl">(Gemara):</span> (The Seifa of the Mishnah details other Arayos included in 'a woman and her daughter.' Presumably, 'a woman and her daughter' refers to the Ervah about which the Torah explicitly punishes by burning, i.e. a mother- in-law.)</p>
<p class="bas indent2"><span class="nm">1.</span><span class="cl">Question:</span> It does not say 'a man who has Bi'ah with a woman whose daughter he married', rather, 'with a woman and (or) her daughter', implying that neither of these is his wife, rather, both of them are forbidden;</p>
<p class="bas indent3"><span class="nm">i.</span>What daughter and her mother are both forbidden to a man?</p>
<p class="bas indent2"><span class="nm">2.</span><span class="cl">Answer:</span> It refers to his mother-in-law and her mother. (He is burned for Bi'ah with his mother-in- law's mother <i>or</i> her daughter, i.e. his mother-in- law.)</p>
<p class="bas indent1"><span class="nm">(d)</span><span class="cl">Inference:</span> The Mishnah holds that the other Arayos listed are included in 'a woman and her daughter.' This implies that the Torah specifies burning for 'a woman and her daughter', (i.e. his mother-in-law and her mother). We learn the other cases from Derashos.</p>
<p class="bas indent1"><span class="nm">(e)</span><span class="cl">Question:</span> We understand this according to Abaye, who says that R. Akiva and R. Yishmael argue only about how to expound the laws. Our Mishnah is like R. Akiva (who says that the mother of the mother-in-law is explicit in the Torah).</p>
<p class="bas indent2"><span class="nm">1.</span>However, Rava says that they argue about the punishment of a mother-in-law after the wife died, and no one says that the mother of the mother-in-law is explicit. If so, like whom is the Mishnah?</p>
<p class="bas indent1"><span class="nm">(f)</span><span class="cl">Answer:</span> Rava's text of the Mishnah must say 'a man who has Bi'ah with a woman whose daughter he married.'</p>
<p class="bas indent1"><span class="nm">(g)</span><span class="cl">(Mishnah):</span> 'A man who has Bi'ah with a woman and her daughter' includes... his mother-in-law and the mothers of his wife's mother and father.</p>
<p class="bas indent1"><span class="nm">(h)</span>According to Abaye, since we had to teach the mother of his wife's father, we also mentioned his mother-in-law and her mother (even though they are the 'woman and her daughter' we are learning from);</p>
<p class="bas indent1"><span class="nm">(i)</span>According to Rava, since we had to teach the mother of his wife's father and mother, it also mentioned his mother-in-law (even though this is the 'woman whose daughter he married' we are learning from).</p>

<p class="bas indent1"><span class="nm">(b)</span><span class="cl">Answer (Beraisa):</span> "Ish Asher Yikach Ishah v'Es Imah" - this teaches only a mother-in-law;</p>
<p class="bas indent2"><span class="nm">1.</span><span class="cl">Question:</span> What is the source to include the daughter and granddaughters of his wife?</p>
<p class="bas indent2"><span class="nm">2.</span><span class="cl">Answer:</span> It says "Zimah" regarding (burning for Bi'ah with) a mother-in-law, and also regarding (Bi'ah with) his wife's daughter and granddaughters;</p>
<p class="bas indent3"><span class="nm">i.</span>Just like here the punishment is burning, also there.</p>
<p class="bas indent2"><span class="nm">3.</span><span class="cl">Question:</span> What is the source to consider males like females? (This will be explained.)</p>
<p class="bas indent2"><span class="nm">4.</span><span class="cl">Answer:</span> It says "Zimah" here, and also there;</p>

<p class="bas indent2"><span class="nm">2.</span><span class="cl">Rejection:</span> The verse explicitly teaches both together. Obviously, the same law applies to them!</p>
<p class="bas indent1"><span class="nm">(d)</span><span class="cl">Answer #1:</span> The mother of his wife's father is like the mother of his wife's mother.</p>
<p class="bas indent1"><span class="nm">(e)</span><span class="cl">Rejection:</span> We did not yet show that the mother of his wife's mother is forbidden (until the next clause), we cannot use it to teach about the mother of his wife's father!</p>
<p class="bas bbbline">75b----------------------------------------75b</p>
<p class="bas indent1"><span class="nm">(f)</span><span class="cl">Answer #2 (Abaye):</span> The Tana asks, what is the source to make a man's own She'er (daughter and granddaughters, i.e. that are not from his wife) like his wife's (daughter and granddaughters)? He answers, it says "Zimah" here, and also there...</p>
<p class="bas indent1"><span class="nm">(g)</span><span class="cl">Question:</span> It does not say Zimah regarding a man's own She'er!</p>
<p class="bas indent1"><span class="nm">(h)</span><span class="cl">Version #1 - Rashi - Answer (Rava):</span> First, we learn from a Gezeirah Shavah "Henah-Henah", that it is as if Zimah was written regarding his own She'er;</p>
<p class="bas indent2"><span class="nm">1.</span>Then, we can learn burning from the Gezeirah Shavah "Zimah-Zimah."</p>
<p class="bas indent1"><span class="nm">(i)</span><span class="cl">Version #2 - Ramah - Answer #3 (Rava):</span> We learn from a Gezeirah Shavah "Henah-Henah", that his daughter and granddaughters have the same law like his wife's;</p>
<p class="bas indent2"><span class="nm">1.</span>We learn burning regarding his wife's daughter and granddaughters from the Gezeirah Shavah "Zimah- Zimah" from his mother-in-law. (End of Version #2)</p>

<p class="bas indent1"><span class="nm">(l)</span><span class="cl">Objection:</span> That is equating <i>above</i> like <i>below</i>!</p>
<p class="bas indent2"><span class="nm">1.</span><span class="cl">Suggestion:</span> Indeed, the Beraisa should say 'what is the source to equate above like below'!</p>
<p class="bas indent2"><span class="nm">2.</span><span class="cl">Rejection:</span> The Beraisa answers 'it says "Zimah" here, and also there';</p>
<p class="bas indent3"><span class="nm">i.</span>This cannot refer to a wife's grandmothers, for they are not written at all!</p>
<p class="bas indent1"><span class="nm">(m)</span><span class="cl">Answer #2 (Abaye):</span> It asks, what is the source to equate three generations above (i.e. up to the wife's grandmothers) like three generations below (up to the wife's granddaughters)? (Abaye switches the Beraisa to say 'what is the source to equate above like below'?)</p>
<p class="bas indent2"><span class="nm">1.</span>It answers, it says "Zimah" here, and also there;</p>
<p class="bas indent3"><span class="nm">i.</span>Just like (three generations) below are forbidden, also above;</p>
<p class="bas indent3"><span class="nm">ii.</span>Just like the punishment above (for a mother- in-law is burning), also (three generations) below;</p>
<p class="bas indent3"><span class="nm">iii.</span>Just like the Torah writes a Lav (for three generations) below, also above is forbidden by a Lav. (Even regarding the mother-in-law, only the punishment is written, and not a Lav).</p>
<p class="bas indent1"><span class="nm">(n)</span><span class="cl">Answer #3 (Rav Ashi):</span> Really, we equate below like above;</p>
<p class="bas indent2"><span class="nm">1.</span>'Below' refers to the mothers of the wife's parents (they are more distant, a less severe Isur). 'Above' refers to the mother-in-law (she is closer, which is more severe).</p>
<p class="bas indent2"><span class="nm">2.</span>(When it answers 'it says "Zimah" here, it refers to Zimah written regarding the mother-in-law; Zimah is also written 'there', regarding the wife's daughter and granddaughters;</p>
<p class="bas indent3"><span class="nm">i.</span>Just like there, below (her granddaughters, which are more distant and hence less severe) is forbidden like above (her daughter), also here (the grandmothers are forbidden like the mother).)</p>
<p class="bas subject"><span class="nm">4)</span>WHY IS ONE PERMITTED TO MARRY HIS GRANDMOTHER?</p>
<p class="bas indent1"><span class="nm">(a)</span><span class="cl">Question:</span> Since we equate his She'er to hers, his mother's mother should be forbidden!</p>
<p class="bas indent1"><span class="nm">(b)</span><span class="cl">Answer #1 (Abaye):</span> "Imcha Hi" - he is liable for his mother, and not for his grandmother.</p>
<p class="bas indent1"><span class="nm">(c)</span><span class="cl">Answer #2 (Rava):</span> We cannot learn his grandmother from hers, neither like the one who says Dun Minah u'Minah (when a matter is learned from another matter, we learn everything from the source), nor like the one who says Dun Minah v'Uki b'Asra (we only learn one law from the source, but other laws are like the matter being learned):</p>
<p class="bas indent2"><span class="nm">1.</span>If we say Dun Minah u'Minah, and we want to learn that his grandmother is forbidden, just like hers, we <i>must</i> also learn that the punishment is burning, just like there;</p>
<p class="bas indent3"><span class="nm">i.</span>According to R. Shimon, who says that burning is more stringent than stoning, we can refute this. The Torah is more stringent about his wife's relatives than his own (a mother-in-law is punishable by burning, but his own mother is only stoning);</p>
<p class="bas indent3"><span class="nm">ii.</span>Also, his own mother is punishable by stoning. His grandmother cannot be more stringent (burning)!</p>
<p class="bas indent3"><span class="nm">iii.</span>Also, just like the laws of his wife's mother and grandmother are the same, the laws of his own mother and grandmother should be the same!</p>
<p class="bas indent3"><span class="nm">iv.</span>This last objection applies also according to Chachamim, who say that stoning is more stringent than burning. Therefore, we cannot learn that his grandmother is forbidden.</p>
<p class="bas indent2"><span class="nm">2.</span>If we say Dun Minah v'Uki b'Asra, and we want to learn that his grandmother is forbidden, just like hers, we would say that the punishment is like that for his mother, stoning;</p>
<p class="bas indent3"><span class="nm">i.</span>According to R. Shimon, who says that burning is more stringent, we cannot learn his relatives from hers. The Torah is more stringent about his wife's relatives than his own (a mother-in-law is punishable by burning, his own mother is only stoning);</p>
<p class="bas indent3"><span class="nm">ii.</span>Also, this is unlike his wife's She'er. The same punishment applies to her daughter and her grandmother, but we would distinguish between his daughter (burning) and his grandmother (stoning)!</p>
<p class="bas indent3"><span class="nm">iii.</span>This last objection applies also according to Chachamim, who say that stoning is more stringent.</p>
