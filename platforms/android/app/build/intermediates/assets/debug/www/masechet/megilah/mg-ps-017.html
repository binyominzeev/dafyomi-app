<p class="bas subject"><span class="nm">1)</span>THE CALCULATION OF YAKOV'S YEARS</p>
<p class="bas indent1"><span class="nm">(a)</span><span class="cl">(Rabah):</span> Learning Torah is greater than honoring parents;</p>
<p class="bas indent2"><span class="nm">1.</span>Yakov was punished for 22 years that he was away, but not for the 14 years that he learned in the house of Ever.</p>
<p class="bas indent1"><span class="nm">(b)</span>The Torah records Yishmael's years to teach about Yakov's years. (When Yakov left home, Esav went to Yishmael and married Machalas, Nevayos' sister. Yishmael engaged her to Esav and soon died, so Nevayos finalized the marriage.)</p>
<p class="bas indent2"><span class="nm">1.</span>Yishmael died at 137. Yitzchak was 14 years younger, for Avraham was 86 and 100 at the times of their respective births.</p>
<p class="bas indent2"><span class="nm">2.</span>Yakov was born when Yitzchak was 60, so Yakov was 63 when he left home.</p>
<p class="bas indent2"><span class="nm">3.</span>Yakov worked for Lavan for 14 years before Yosef was born. Yosef was 30 when he came in front of Paro.</p>
<p class="bas indent1"><span class="nm">(c)</span><span class="cl">Question:</span> Yakov came to Paro nine years later (seven years of plenty and two of famine), and said that he was 130. Our calculation shows that he was 116!</p>
<p class="bas indent1"><span class="nm">(d)</span><span class="cl">Answer:</span> He learned in Ever's academy for 14 years before coming to Lavan.</p>
<p class="bas indent1"><span class="nm">(e)</span><span class="cl">(Beraisa):</span> Yosef was separated from Yakov for 22 years. This was a punishment for his 22 years away from home.</p>
<p class="bas indent1"><span class="nm">(f)</span><span class="cl">Question:</span> Yakov was by Lavan only 20 years!</p>
<p class="bas indent1"><span class="nm">(g)</span><span class="cl">Answer:</span> He tarried two years on the way home:</p>
<p class="bas indent2"><span class="nm">1.</span><span class="cl">(Beraisa):</span> Yakov left Aram Naharayim and went to Sukos, and spent 18 months there - "Va'Yiven Lo Bayis ul'Miknehu Osah Sukos" (the house was for one winter, Sukos (plural) alludes to shacks for two summers);</p>
<p class="bas indent2"><span class="nm">2.</span>He spent six months in Beis Kel and offered Korbanos.</p>
<p class="perekline">PEREK HA'KOREI ES HA'MEGILAH</p>
<p class="bas subject"><span class="nm">2)</span>MISHNAH: HALACHOS OF KERI'AS HA'MEGILAH</p>
<p class="bas indent1"><span class="nm">(a)</span>One is not Yotzei Keri'as ha'Megilah through reading it in the following ways:</p>
<p class="bas indent2"><span class="nm">1.</span>Out of order;</p>
<p class="bas indent2"><span class="nm">2.</span>By heart;</p>
<p class="bas indent2"><span class="nm">3.</span>In Arameic translation or in any other language.</p>
<p class="bas indent1"><span class="nm">(b)</span>One may read in La'az (a foreign language) to a Lo'ez (one who speaks La'az).</p>
<p class="bas indent1"><span class="nm">(c)</span>The following were Yotzei:</p>
<p class="bas indent2"><span class="nm">1.</span>A Lo'ez who heard Ashuris (Hebrew. Ritva - this is l'Chatchilah; it says 'one who heard' for parallel structure with the Reisha.)</p>
<p class="bas indent2"><span class="nm">2.</span>One who paused or dozed in the middle of reading.</p>
<p class="bas indent1"><span class="nm">(d)</span>One who was writing, expounding or proofreading a Megilah is Yotzei if he intended.</p>
<p class="bas indent1"><span class="nm">(e)</span>One is Yotzei only if the Megilah is written in Ashuris, with ink, on parchment.</p>
<p class="bas subject"><span class="nm">3)</span>THINGS WHICH MUST BE READ IN ORDER</p>
<p class="bas indent1"><span class="nm">(a)</span><span class="cl">(Gemara) Question:</span> What is the source that the Megilah must be read in order?</p>
<p class="bas indent1"><span class="nm">(b)</span><span class="cl">Answer #1 (Rava):</span> "Ki'Chsavam vechi'Zmanam" - just like the times cannot be out of order (the 15th cannot precede the 14th), also (reading) what is written may not be out of order.</p>
<p class="bas indent1"><span class="nm">(c)</span><span class="cl">Objection:</span> The verse discusses doing (the days of Purim), not Keri'as ha'Megilah!</p>
<p class="bas indent1"><span class="nm">(d)</span><span class="cl">Answer #2:</span> Rather, We learn from "Are remembered and done" - we equate the remembrance (Kri'ah) with the doing, which cannot be out of order.</p>
<p class="bas indent1"><span class="nm">(e)</span><span class="cl">(Beraisa):</span> Similarly Hallel, Keri'as Shema and prayer must be said in order.</p>
<p class="bas indent1"><span class="nm">(f)</span><span class="cl">Question:</span> What is the source for Hallel?</p>
<p class="bas indent1"><span class="nm">(g)</span><span class="cl">Answer #1 (Rabah):</span> "From the east (rising) of the sun until its setting" (just like these are never out of order, also Keri'as ha'Hallel).</p>
<p class="bas indent1"><span class="nm">(h)</span><span class="cl">Answer #2 (Rav Yosef):</span> "This is the day" (just like a day always passes in order... )</p>
<p class="bas indent1"><span class="nm">(i)</span><span class="cl">Answer #3 (Rav Avya):</span> "Hash-m's name should be blessed" (just like His name is in order, so must be praise of His name).</p>
<p class="bas indent1"><span class="nm">(j)</span><span class="cl">Answer #4 (Rav Nachman bar Yitzchak):</span> "From now and forever."</p>
<p class="bas indent1"><span class="nm">(k)</span><span class="cl">Question:</span> What is the source regarding Keri'as Shema?</p>
<p class="bas indent1"><span class="nm">(l)</span><span class="cl">Answer (Beraisa - Rebbi):</span> Keri'as Shema must be recited like it is written (in Hebrew);</p>
<p class="bas indent1"><span class="nm">(m)</span>Chachamim permit all languages.</p>
<p class="bas bbbline">17b----------------------------------------17b</p>
<p class="bas indent2"><span class="nm">1.</span><span class="cl">Question:</span> What is Rebbi's reason?</p>
<p class="bas indent2"><span class="nm">2.</span><span class="cl">Answer:</span> It says "v'Hayu (ha'Devarim ha'Eleh)" -- the words must be like they are (in the Torah, in Hebrew).</p>
<p class="bas indent2"><span class="nm">3.</span><span class="cl">Question:</span> What is Chachamim's reason?</p>
<p class="bas indent2"><span class="nm">4.</span><span class="cl">Answer:</span> "Shema"- in any language you hear (understand).</p>
<p class="bas indent2"><span class="nm">5.</span><span class="cl">Question:</span> How does Rebbi expound "Shema"?</p>
<p class="bas indent2"><span class="nm">6.</span>This teaches that one must say the words audibly to his own ears.</p>
<p class="bas indent2"><span class="nm">7.</span>Chachamim hold like the opinion that one is Yotzei even if it was not audible.</p>
<p class="bas indent2"><span class="nm">8.</span><span class="cl">Question:</span> How do Chachamim expound v'Hayu?</p>
<p class="bas indent2"><span class="nm">9.</span><span class="cl">Answer:</span> This teaches that one may not recite Shema out of order.</p>
<p class="bas indent2"><span class="nm">10.</span><span class="cl">Question:</span> What is Rebbi's source for this?</p>
<p class="bas indent2"><span class="nm">11.</span><span class="cl">Answer:</span> It could have said 'Devarim' - he expounds the Hei in "ha'Devarim";</p>
<p class="bas indent2"><span class="nm">12.</span>Chachamim do not expound the Hei.</p>
<p class="bas indent1"><span class="nm">(n)</span><span class="cl">Inference:</span> Rebbi holds that Torah (Parshiyos that one must recite, such as Parshas Zachor or Keri'as Bikurim) may be recited in any language;</p>
<p class="bas indent2"><span class="nm">1.</span>If he held that Torah must be recited in Hebrew, he would not need "v'Hayu" to teach that Shema must be recited in Hebrew!</p>
<p class="bas indent1"><span class="nm">(o)</span><span class="cl">Rejection:</span> He could hold that it must be recited in Hebrew; "v'Hayu" is needed, so we will not learn from "Shema" to permit any language.</p>
<p class="bas indent1"><span class="nm">(p)</span><span class="cl">Inference:</span> Chachamim hold that Torah must be recited in Hebrew;</p>
<p class="bas indent2"><span class="nm">1.</span>If they held that Torah may be recited in any language, they would not need Shema to permit Keri'as Shema in any language!</p>
<p class="bas indent1"><span class="nm">(q)</span><span class="cl">Rejection:</span> They could hold that Torah may be recited in any language; "Shema" is needed so we will not learn from "v'Hayu" to require Hebrew.</p>
<p class="bas subject"><span class="nm">4)</span>ORDER OF THE EIGHTEEN <i>BERACHOS</i> OF PRAYER</p>
<p class="bas indent1"><span class="nm">(a)</span><span class="cl">Question:</span> What is the source that Tefilah must be read in order?</p>
<p class="bas indent1"><span class="nm">(b)</span><span class="cl">Answer #1 (Beraisa):</span> Shimon ha'Pekuli ordered the 18 Berachos in Yavneh (when the Sanhedrin sat there).</p>
<p class="bas indent1"><span class="nm">(c)</span><span class="cl">Answer #2 (R. Yochanan):</span> 120 Chachamim, including some Nevi'im, enacted 18 Berachos in order.</p>
<p class="bas indent1"><span class="nm">(d)</span><span class="cl">(Beraisa):</span> The order of the Berachos is  as follows, and for the coming reasons:</p>
<p class="bas indent2"><span class="nm">1.</span>Avos - "Havu la'Shem Benei Elim";</p>
<p class="bas indent2"><span class="nm">2.</span>Gevurah  - (the above verse continues) "Havu la'Shem Kavod va'Oz".</p>
<p class="bas indent2"><span class="nm">3.</span>Kedushah - (the next verse is) "Havu la'Shem Kevod Shemo".</p>
<p class="bas indent2"><span class="nm">4.</span>Binah - because "V'Hikdishu Es Kedosh Yakov" is followed by "V'Yad'u So'ei Ru'ach Binah".</p>
<p class="bas indent2"><span class="nm">5.</span>Teshuvah - because the verse says "His heart will understand, and he will repent and be cured."</p>
<p class="bas indent2"><span class="nm">6.</span><span class="cl">Question:</span> If so, Refu'ah should follow repentance!</p>
<p class="bas indent2"><span class="nm">7.</span><span class="cl">Answer:</span> Selichah follows Teshuvah, for it says "He will repent ... Hash-m forgives greatly".</p>
<p class="bas indent3"><span class="nm">i.</span><span class="cl">Question:</span> Why does this override "he will repent and be cured"?</p>
<p class="bas indent3"><span class="nm">ii.</span><span class="cl">Answer:</span> Another verse teaches that Selichah precedes healing and redemption - "He forgives ... He cures and redeems".</p>
<p class="bas indent3"><span class="nm">iii.</span><span class="cl">Question:</span> "He will repent (and be cured)" teaches that Refu'ah should be right after Teshuvah!</p>
<p class="bas indent3"><span class="nm">iv.</span><span class="cl">Answer:</span> "He will be cured" refers to Selichah, and not to physical healing.</p>
<p class="bas indent2"><span class="nm">8.</span><span class="cl">(Rava):</span> Geulah - the future redemption will be in the seventh year (of the Shmitah cycle), so Ge'ulah was made to be the seventh Berachah.</p>
<p class="bas indent3"><span class="nm">i.</span><span class="cl">Question:</span> It was taught that in the seventh year will be wars, and the next year Mashi'ach ben David will come!</p>
<p class="bas indent3"><span class="nm">ii.</span><span class="cl">Answer:</span> The wars begin the redemption.</p>
<p class="bas indent2"><span class="nm">9.</span><span class="cl">(R. Acha):</span> Refu'ah - Refu'ah was fixed to be the eighth Berachah because circumcision, which is on the eighth day, needs Refu'ah.</p>
<p class="bas indent2"><span class="nm">10.</span><span class="cl">(R. Alexandri):</span> Prosperity - this Berachah thwarts those who inflate the price of grain, and Tehilim 9 discusses breaking the arm of such people.</p>
<p class="bas indent2"><span class="nm">11.</span>Gathering of exiles - this follows prosperity, for it says "Mountains of Yisrael... bear fruit for my nation Yisrael, for they will come soon."</p>
<p class="bas indent2"><span class="nm">12.</span>Judgment of Resha'im - this follows gathering of exiles, for it says "I will return My hand on you and remove your refuse", leading to "I will return your judges like from the beginning".</p>
<p class="bas indent2"><span class="nm">13.</span>Deniers and Mezidim - after the wicked are judged, both of these will pass from the world. (This Berachah was added in Yavneh, making the total 19).</p>
<p class="bas indent2"><span class="nm">14.</span>Tzadikim - when sinners are finished, Tzadikim are elevated. Converts are included, because right after "V'Hadarta Penei Zaken" it says "V'Chi Yagur Itchem Ger".</p>
<p class="bas indent2"><span class="nm">15.</span>Yerushalayim - Tzadikim will be elevated in Yerushalayim.</p>
<p class="bas indent2"><span class="nm">16.</span>Malchus David - this will follow the rebuilding of Yerushalayim.</p>
