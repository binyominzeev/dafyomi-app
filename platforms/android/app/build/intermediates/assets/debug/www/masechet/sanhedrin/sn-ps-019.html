<p class="bas subject"><span class="nm">1)</span>YIBUM OF A KOHEN GADOL</p>
<p class="bas indent1"><span class="nm">(a)</span><span class="cl">(Mishnah):</span> He can do Chalitzah, and his widow can do Chalitzah (but he may not do Yibum, for he may not marry a widow).</p>
<p class="bas indent1"><span class="nm">(b)</span>We do not distinguish whether his Yevamah fell to Yibum from Kidushin or Nisu'in.</p>
<p class="bas indent1"><span class="nm">(c)</span>Granted, he cannot be Meyabem a Yevamah from Nisu'in. She is forbidden to a Kohen Gadol by a Lav (she is a widow) and an Aseh (she is not a virgin). An Aseh (Yibum) does not override a Lav and an Aseh.</p>
<p class="bas indent1"><span class="nm">(d)</span><span class="cl">Question:</span> Why can't he be Meyabem a Yevamah from Kidushin? She is forbidden only by a Lav. The Aseh of Yibum should override it!</p>
<p class="bas indent1"><span class="nm">(e)</span><span class="cl">Answer:</span> Mid'Oraisa, he may be Meyabem. Chachamim decreed against this, lest he have Bi'ah with her a second time (which is forbidden by a Lav. The Mitzvah of Yibum is only the first Bi'ah.)</p>
<p class="bas indent1"><span class="nm">(f)</span><span class="cl">Support (Beraisa):</span> If a Yavam (whose Yavamah is forbidden by a Lav) did Yibum, he acquired her (she is married to him). He may not have a second act of Bi'ah.</p>
<p class="bas subject"><span class="nm">2)</span>IF A KOHEN GADOL'S RELATIVE DIES</p>
<p class="bas indent1"><span class="nm">(a)</span><span class="cl">(Mishnah - R. Meir):</span> If one of his close relatives died...</p>
<p class="bas indent1"><span class="nm">(b)</span><span class="cl">(Beraisa):</span> "U'Min ha'Mikdash Lo Yetzei" - he does not go with the procession, but he follows after them. When the procession moves to a new area, he enters the previous area it passed.</p>
<p class="bas indent1"><span class="nm">(c)</span><span class="cl">(Mishnah):</span> ... Until they reach the gate of Yerushalayim. (R. Yehudah says, he does not leave the Mikdash - "u'Min ha'Mikdash Lo Yetzei.")</p>
<p class="bas indent1"><span class="nm">(d)</span><span class="cl">Question:</span> How can R. Meir answer this?!</p>
<p class="bas indent1"><span class="nm">(e)</span><span class="cl">Answer:</span> If he expounds like R. Yehudah, the Kohen Gadol may not go home either!</p>
<p class="bas indent2"><span class="nm">1.</span>Rather, it means he does not leave his <i>Kedushah</i> (he may not become Tamei).</p>
<p class="bas indent2"><span class="nm">2.</span>Since he may not go with the procession, this reminds him not to become Tamei.</p>
<p class="bas indent2"><span class="nm">3.</span>R. Yehudah says, out of sorrow he may come to Metamei himself.</p>
<p class="bas indent1"><span class="nm">(f)</span><span class="cl">(Mishnah):</span> When he consoles others...</p>
<p class="bas indent1"><span class="nm">(g)</span><span class="cl">(Beraisa):</span> When he goes to console (mourners standing in a line), the Segan (the Kohen ready to replace him if this will be required) and the Meshuach She'avar (one who once substituted for the Kohen Gadol) are on his right side. The Av Beis Din, mourners and everyone else are on his left;</p>
<p class="bas indent2"><span class="nm">1.</span>When he stands in the line and others console him, the Segan is on his right side, and the Av Beis Din and everyone else are on his left;</p>
<p class="bas indent2"><span class="nm">2.</span><span class="cl">Inference:</span> The Meshuach She'avar does not come to console him.</p>
<p class="bas indent2"><span class="nm">3.</span><span class="cl">Question:</span> What is the reason?</p>
<p class="bas indent2"><span class="nm">4.</span><span class="cl">Answer:</span> The Kohen Gadol might think 'he is happy about my loss.'</p>
<p class="bas subject"><span class="nm">3)</span>THE CONSOLATION LINE</p>
<p class="bas indent1"><span class="nm">(a)</span><span class="cl">(Rav Papa):</span> We learn three things from this Beraisa:</p>
<p class="bas indent2"><span class="nm">1.</span>The Segan is the Memuneh (mentioned in the Mishnah);</p>
<p class="bas indent2"><span class="nm">2.</span>The mourners stand still and everyone else passes;</p>
<p class="bas indent2"><span class="nm">3.</span>The mourners stand on the left of the consolers (when he goes to console, the mourners are on his left).</p>
<p class="bas indent1"><span class="nm">(b)</span><span class="cl">(Beraisa):</span> At first, the mourners would stand and everyone would pass;</p>
<p class="bas indent2"><span class="nm">1.</span>There were two families in Yerushalayim who fought over which would pass first. They enacted that the consolers stand, and the mourners pass.</p>
<p class="bas indent1"><span class="nm">(c)</span><span class="cl">(Rami bar Aba):</span> In Tzipori, R. Yosi returned the custom like it used to be (the mourners stand, and everyone else passes).</p>
<p class="bas indent1"><span class="nm">(d)</span><span class="cl">(Rami bar Aba):</span> In Tzipori, R. Yosi enacted that a woman not walk in the market with her son in back of her, due to an incident. (People kidnapped her son. They told her where he was, and molested her when she went there.)</p>
<p class="bas indent1"><span class="nm">(e)</span><span class="cl">(Rami bar Aba):</span> In Tzipori, R. Yosi enacted that women talk with each other in the privy, so a man will know not to go there (lest he be secluded with them).</p>
<p class="bas indent1"><span class="nm">(f)</span><span class="cl">Question (Rav Menasiya bar Avas):</span> What is the minimal size of a condolence line?</p>
<p class="bas indent1"><span class="nm">(g)</span><span class="cl">Answer (R. Yoshiyah):</span> It is at least 10, not including the mourners;</p>
<p class="bas indent2"><span class="nm">1.</span>This applies whether the mourners stand and everyone passes, or vice-versa.</p>
<p class="bas indent1"><span class="nm">(h)</span><span class="cl">(Mishnah):</span> When he is consoled, they say...</p>
<p class="bas indent1"><span class="nm">(i)</span><span class="cl">Question:</span> When he consoles others, what does he say?</p>
<p class="bas indent1"><span class="nm">(j)</span><span class="cl">Answer (Beraisa):</span> He says 'you should be consoled.'</p>
<p class="bas indent1"><span class="nm">(k)</span><span class="cl">Question:</span> What is the case?</p>
<p class="bas indent2"><span class="nm">1.</span>If they console him, this is like a curse that they should (become mourners and) need consolation!</p>
<p class="bas indent1"><span class="nm">(l)</span><span class="cl">Answer:</span> He consoles others (by saying this).</p>
<p class="bas subject"><span class="nm">4)</span>SPECIAL LAWS OF KINGS</p>
<p class="bas indent1"><span class="nm">(a)</span><span class="cl">(Mishnah):</span> A king does not judge...</p>
<p class="bas indent1"><span class="nm">(b)</span><span class="cl">(Rav Yosef):</span> This applies only to kings of (the 10 tribes of) Yisrael, but kings of Beis David judge and are judged - "Beis David... Dino la'Boker Mishpat."</p>
<p class="bas indent2"><span class="nm">1.</span>If they could not be judged, they could not judge!</p>
<p class="bas indent2"><span class="nm">2.</span><span class="cl">(Reish Lakish):</span> "Hiskosheshu va'Koshu" - first fix yourself, then correct others.</p>
<p class="bas indent1"><span class="nm">(c)</span><span class="cl">Question:</span> Why don't we judge kings of Yisrael?</p>
<p class="bas indent1"><span class="nm">(d)</span><span class="cl">Answer:</span> An episode occurred, and Melech Yanai's slave killed someone. Shimon ben Shetach told Chachamim to judge him.</p>
<p class="bas indent2"><span class="nm">1.</span>They told Yanai that his slave killed someone; Yanai sent him. They told Yanai that he should be there when his slave is judged, just like an ox is judged in front of its owner - "v'Hu'ad bi'V'alav." Yanai came, and sat down.</p>
<p class="bas indent2"><span class="nm">2.</span><span class="cl">Shimon ben Shetach:</span> You must stand, not for us, but because you are in front of Hash-m - "v'Omedu Shnei ha'Anashim... Lifnei Hash-m."</p>
<p class="bas indent2"><span class="nm">3.</span><span class="cl">Yanai:</span> I will not listen to you, rather, to the other judges.</p>
<p class="bas bbbline">19b----------------------------------------19b</p>
<p class="bas indent2"><span class="nm">4.</span>The other judges looked down (they feared Yanai). Shimon ben Shetach said that Hash-m should punish them. The angel Gavri'el killed them all.</p>
<p class="bas indent2"><span class="nm">5.</span>It was enacted then that kings of Yisrael do not judge, and we do not judge them. They do not testify, and we do not testify against them.</p>
<p class="bas indent1"><span class="nm">(e)</span><span class="cl">(Mishnah):</span> He does not do Chalitzah. His widow does not do Chalitzah... (R. Yehudah says, if he wants to do Chalitzah or Yibum, he may. He is praised for this.)</p>
<p class="bas indent1"><span class="nm">(f)</span><span class="cl">Question:</span> Rav Ashi taught that even according to the opinion that a Nasi can pardon his honor, a king cannot - "Som Tasim Alecha Melech"! (In Chalitzah, the Yevamah spits at the Yavam.)</p>
<p class="bas indent1"><span class="nm">(g)</span><span class="cl">Answer:</span> He can pardon his honor for the sake of a Mitzvah.</p>
<p class="bas indent1"><span class="nm">(h)</span><span class="cl">(Mishnah):</span> One may not marry a king's widow. (R. Yehudah says, he may. We learn from David - "va'Etnah Lecha... Neshei Adonecha.")</p>
<p class="bas indent1"><span class="nm">(i)</span><span class="cl">(Beraisa):</span> Chachamim answered 'No. That refers to Sha'ul's <i>daughters</i>, Merav and Michal (but Sha'ul's widows were forbidden to David).</p>
<p class="bas indent1"><span class="nm">(j)</span><span class="cl">Question:</span> How could David marry two sisters in each other's lifetime?</p>
<p class="bas indent1"><span class="nm">(k)</span><span class="cl">Answer #1 (R. Yosi):</span> He married Michal after Merav died.</p>
<p class="bas indent1"><span class="nm">(l)</span><span class="cl">Answer #2 (R. Yehoshua ben Korchah):</span> He was never truly married to Merav. It was mistaken Kidushin - "Tenah Es Ishti Es Michal..."</p>
<p class="bas indent1"><span class="nm">(m)</span><span class="cl">Question:</span> How do we learn this from the verse?</p>
<p class="bas indent1"><span class="nm">(n)</span><span class="cl">Answer (Rav Papa):</span> Only Michal is Ishti (my wife), and not Merav.</p>
<p class="bas indent1"><span class="nm">(o)</span><span class="cl">Question:</span> What was the mistaken Kidushin?</p>
<p class="bas indent1"><span class="nm">(p)</span><span class="cl">Answer:</span> "Ha'Ish Asher Yakenu Yasherenu ha'Melech Osher Gadol v'Es Bito Yiten Lo." David killed Galyus;</p>
<p class="bas indent2"><span class="nm">1.</span><span class="cl">Sha'ul:</span> I owe you money (for killing Galyus). A loan does not make Kidushin.</p>
<p class="bas indent2"><span class="nm">2.</span>Sha'ul gave Merav to Adri'el - "v'Hi Nitenah l'Adri'el."</p>
<p class="bas indent2"><span class="nm">3.</span><span class="cl">Sha'ul:</span> If you want to marry Michal, bring me 100 foreskins of Plishtim. (David did so.)</p>
<p class="bas indent2"><span class="nm">4.</span><span class="cl">Sha'ul:</span> These are worth a Perutah, but I also owe you money!</p>
<p class="bas indent3"><span class="nm">i.</span>Sha'ul held that Kidushin made with a loan and a Perutah is invalid because she (in this case, her father, i.e. Hilchos)  intends to become Mekudeshes through the loan, and this is invalid;</p>
<p class="bas indent3"><span class="nm">ii.</span>David held that it is valid. She intends to become Mekudeshes through the Perutah.</p>
<p class="bas indent2"><span class="nm">5.</span>Alternatively, Sha'ul agreed that she intends to become Mekudeshes through the Perutah. He said that the foreskins have no value, so David did not give a Perutah;</p>
<p class="bas indent3"><span class="nm">i.</span>David held that they are worth a Perutah, for one can feed them to dogs and cats.</p>
<p class="bas indent1"><span class="nm">(q)</span><span class="cl">Question:</span> What does R. Yosi learn from "Tenah Es Ishti Es Michal..."?</p>
<p class="bas indent1"><span class="nm">(r)</span><span class="cl">Answer (Beraisa - R. Yosi):</span> We expound different verses as if they were written together: "...Chameshes Bnei Michal Bas Sha'ul Asher Yoledah l'Adri'el."</p>
<p class="bas indent2"><span class="nm">1.</span><span class="cl">Question:</span> Michal was not given to Adri'el, rather to Palti ben Layish - "v'Sha'ul Nasan Es Michal Bito Eshes David l'Palti ben Layish"!</p>
<p class="bas indent2"><span class="nm">2.</span><span class="cl">Answer:</span> Rather, the verse equates Merav's Kidushin to Adri'el to that of Michal to Palti ben Layish. Just like the latter was invalid (because she was David's Arusah ), also the former!</p>
<p class="bas subject"><span class="nm">5)</span>ONE WHO RAISES ANOTHER'S CHILDREN</p>
<p class="bas indent1"><span class="nm">(a)</span><span class="cl">Question:</span> What does R. Yehoshua ben Korchah learn from "Bnei Michal... Asher Yoledah l'Adri'el?</p>
<p class="bas indent2"><span class="nm">1.</span><span class="cl">Question:</span> They were not Michal's sons, rather Merav's sons!</p>
<p class="bas indent1"><span class="nm">(b)</span><span class="cl">Answer (to both questions):</span> They were Merav's sons. Michal raised them, so they are called her sons;</p>
<p class="bas indent2"><span class="nm">1.</span>This teaches that one who raises an orphan is credited as if he fathered him.</p>
<p class="bas indent1"><span class="nm">(c)</span>R. Chanina learns this from "...Yulad Ben l'No'omi... Oved."</p>
<p class="bas indent2"><span class="nm">1.</span><span class="cl">Question:</span> He was not No'omi's son, rather, Rus' son!</p>
<p class="bas indent2"><span class="nm">2.</span><span class="cl">Answer:</span> Even though he was Rus' son, because No'omi' raised him, he is called No'omi's son.</p>
<p class="bas indent1"><span class="nm">(d)</span><span class="cl">(R. Yochanan):</span> We learn from "Yered Avi Gedor... (names of Moshe) Bnei Bisyah Vas Paro Asher Lakach Mared."</p>
<p class="bas indent2"><span class="nm">1.</span>Mared is Kalev. He is called Mared because he rebelled against the counsel of the other Meraglim.</p>
<p class="bas indent2"><span class="nm">2.</span><span class="cl">Question:</span> Moshe was not Basyah's son, rather, Yocheved's!</p>
<p class="bas indent2"><span class="nm">3.</span><span class="cl">Answer:</span> Even though he was Yocheved's son, because Basyah raised him, he is called her son.</p>
<p class="bas indent1"><span class="nm">(e)</span><span class="cl">(R. Elazar):</span> We learn from "Ga'alta bi'Zro'a Amecha Bnei Yakov v'Yosef."</p>
<p class="bas indent2"><span class="nm">1.</span><span class="cl">Question:</span> Bnei Yisrael descend from Yakov, (most are) not from Yosef!</p>
<p class="bas indent2"><span class="nm">2.</span><span class="cl">Answer:</span> Since Yosef provided their food, they are called by his name.</p>
<p class="bas indent1"><span class="nm">(f)</span><span class="cl">(R. Shmuel bar Nachmani):</span> If one teaches another's child Torah, the Torah considers him to have fathered him - "v'Eleh Toldos Aharon u'Moshe";</p>
<p class="bas indent2"><span class="nm">1.</span>Aharon fathered them. Moshe taught them, so they are called Moshe's children.</p>
<p class="bas indent1"><span class="nm">(g)</span><span class="cl">Question:</span> "Beis Yakov Asher Padah Es Avraham" - where do we find that Yakov redeemed Avraham?</p>
<p class="bas indent1"><span class="nm">(h)</span><span class="cl">Answer (Rav Yehudah):</span> He redeemed him from (i.e. bore himself) the pain of raising (Rashi - many) children.</p>
<p class="bas indent2"><span class="nm">1.</span>"Lo Atah Yevosh Yakov" - now (after enduring this awesome burden,) Yakov is not ashamed in front of Yitzchak;</p>
<p class="bas indent2"><span class="nm">2.</span>"Lo Atah Panav Yechevaru" - now he is not ashamed in front of Avraham.</p>
<p class="bas indent1"><span class="nm">(i)</span><span class="cl">Question:</span> We find that Palti'el is called Palti!</p>
<p class="bas indent1"><span class="nm">(j)</span><span class="cl">Answer (R. Yochanan):</span> His name is Palti. He is called Palti'el because Palto Kel (Hash-m saved him from sinning).</p>
<p class="bas indent2"><span class="nm">1.</span>He put a knife between himself and Michal, and said 'whoever will engage in Bi'ah, he will be stabbed with this sword.'</p>

<p class="bas indent2"><span class="nm">3.</span><span class="cl">Answer:</span> He was <i>like</i> a husband to her (he raised and cared for her like a husband).</p>
<p class="bas indent2"><span class="nm">4.</span><span class="cl">Question:</span> "Halach u'Vacho" (if he never really married her, why was he so upset when she was taken)?</p>
<p class="bas indent2"><span class="nm">5.</span><span class="cl">Answer:</span> He cried because he lost the Mitzvah (of overcoming his temptation for her).</p>
<p class="bas indent3"><span class="nm">i.</span>"Ad Bachorim" - they were like singles (they did not have Bi'ah).</p>
<p class="bas indent1"><span class="nm">(k)</span><span class="cl">Version #1 - Rashi - (R.

<p class="bas indent2"><span class="nm">1.</span>Yosef's great deed was a small matter for Bo'az (Yosef was tempted by a married woman, and Bo'az by a single girl in bed with him) - "va'Yecherad ha'Ish va'Yilafes."</p>
<p class="bas indent1"><span class="nm">(l)</span><span class="cl">Version #2 - Ramah - (R.

<p class="bas indent2"><span class="nm">3.</span><span class="cl">Version #1 - Ramah:</span> This shows that Bo'az had to fight to overcome temptation.</p>
