<p class="bas subject"><span class="nm">1)</span>UNDOING A <i>MA'AMAR</i></p>
<p class="bas indent1"><span class="nm">(a)</span>(The Mishnah said that if Reuven died, Shimon gave a Ma'amar, then he died, both Yevamos do Chalitzah, not Yibum.)</p>
<p class="bas indent1"><span class="nm">(b)</span><span class="cl">Version #1 (Rava):</span> If a Yavam gave a Ma'amar to Leah and then a Get to undo the Ma'amar, her Tzarah may do Yibum. Leah is forbidden, lest she be confused with the recipient of a Get to undo Zikah.</p>
<p class="bas indent1"><span class="nm">(c)</span><span class="cl">Version #2 (Rava):</span> If he gave a Get to undo his Ma'amar to Leah, even she may do Yibum. He undid his Ma'amar.</p>
<p class="bas subject"><span class="nm">2)</span>A <i>YEVAMAH</i> WHO WAS ONCE FORBIDDEN IS ALWAYS FORBIDDEN</p>
<p class="bas indent1"><span class="nm">(a)</span><span class="cl">(Mishnah):</span> Reuven and Shimon (brothers) were married, respectively, to Rachel and Leah (sisters). Reuven died, and then Shimon's wife died. Reuven's widow is forever forbidden, since she was once forbidden.</p>
<p class="bas indent1"><span class="nm">(b)</span><span class="cl">(Gemara) Question:</span> This is obvious!</p>
<p class="bas indent2"><span class="nm">1.</span>In the Mishnah of three brothers (30a), when she was able to do Yibum with a different Yavam, she was forever forbidden to the Yavam she was initially forbidden to.</p>
<p class="bas indent2"><span class="nm">2.</span>Here, she cannot (initially) do Yibum at all, all the more so, she is forever forbidden!</p>
<p class="bas indent1"><span class="nm">(c)</span><span class="cl">Answer:</span> The Tana first taught our Mishnah, thinking that in the other case, she would be permitted. Later, he realized that even there, she is forbidden.</p>
<p class="bas indent2"><span class="nm">1.</span>Since it is a bigger Chidush, he put it before our Mishnah. Our Mishnah was retained (even though it does not add a Chidush).</p>
<p class="bas subject"><span class="nm">3)</span>CAN TWO <i>ISURIM</i> APPLY SIMULTANEOUSLY?</p>
<p class="bas indent1"><span class="nm">(a)</span><span class="cl">(Beraisa #1 - R. Yosi):</span> If Shimon had Bi'ah with Rachel (before Leah died), he is liable for the Isurim of Eshes Ach and Achos Ishto;</p>
<p class="bas indent2"><span class="nm">1.</span>R. Shimon says, he is liable only for Eshes Ach.</p>
<p class="bas indent1"><span class="nm">(b)</span><span class="cl">Contradiction (Beraisa #2 - R. Shimon):</span> He is liable only for Achos Ishto!</p>
<p class="bas indent1"><span class="nm">(c)</span><span class="cl">Answer:</span> (He always holds that only the first Isur takes effect.) In Beraisa #2 Shimon married (Leah) before Reuven married (Rachel, so the Isur of Eshes Ach took effect first). In Beraisa #1, Reuven married first.</p>
<p class="bas indent1"><span class="nm">(d)</span><span class="cl">Question:</span> According to R. Shimon, when Reuven married first, since the Isur of Achos Ishto does not take effect, Yibum should be permitted!</p>
<p class="bas indent1"><span class="nm">(e)</span><span class="cl">Answer (Rav Ashi):</span> The Isur is pending. If the Isur of Eshes Ach would go away, the Isur of Achos Ishto would take effect;</p>
<p class="bas indent2"><span class="nm">1.</span>Therefore, Yibum is forbidden, and the Isur of Eshes Ach remains.</p>
<p class="bas indent1"><span class="nm">(f)</span><span class="cl">Question:</span> Does R. Yosi really hold that Isur Chal Al Isur (a second Isur takes effect on something already forbidden)?</p>
<p class="bas indent2"><span class="nm">1.</span><span class="cl">(Beraisa):</span> If a man did an Aveirah punishable by two different deaths, he receives the more severe one;</p>
<p class="bas indent2"><span class="nm">2.</span>R. Yosi says, he is sentenced to the first that applied.</p>
<p class="bas indent2"><span class="nm">3.</span><span class="cl">(Beraisa):</span> What is considered the first that applies? If Chamoso (his mother-in-law) got married (and he had Bi'ah with her), he is liable for Chamoso. If she was married and then became his mother-in-law, he is liable for Eshes Ish.</p>
<p class="bas bbbline">32b----------------------------------------32b</p>
<p class="bas indent1"><span class="nm">(g)</span><span class="cl">Answer #1 (R. Avahu):</span> R. Yosi agrees that that Isur Chal Al Isur if the latter Isur is Mosif (it forbids the forbidden object to more people).</p>
<p class="bas indent1"><span class="nm">(h)</span><span class="cl">Objection:</span> This explains the case when Shimon married before Reuven did. When Rachel married Reuven, she became forbidden to all his brothers, so the Isur of Eshes Ach also takes effect on Shimon (her sister's husband).</p>
<p class="bas indent2"><span class="nm">1.</span>However, when Reuven married first, why is Achos Ishto an Isur Mosif (when Shimon marries Leah? Rachel does not become forbidden to more people!)</p>
<p class="bas indent2"><span class="nm">2.</span><span class="cl">Suggestion:</span> It is Mosif because Shimon became forbidden to all the sisters.</p>
<p class="bas indent2"><span class="nm">3.</span><span class="cl">Rejection:</span> This is an Isur Kolel (it forbids more objects on the person)!</p>
<p class="bas indent1"><span class="nm">(i)</span><span class="cl">Answer #2 (Rava):</span> Really, he is liable only for one. R. Yosi means that he is considered liable for both;</p>
<p class="bas indent2"><span class="nm">1.</span>This teaches that he is buried among the utterly wicked (like one who did two Aveiros).</p>
<p class="bas indent1"><span class="nm">(j)</span>R. Chiya and Bar Kapara argued as R. Yosi and R. Shimon do.</p>
<p class="bas indent1"><span class="nm">(k)</span><span class="cl">(R. Chiya):</span> If a Zar (non-Kohen) served in the Mikdash on Shabbos, he is liable for two Aveiros;</p>
<p class="bas indent1"><span class="nm">(l)</span><span class="cl">(Bar Kapara):</span> He is liable for one.</p>
<p class="bas indent1"><span class="nm">(m)</span><span class="cl">R. Chiya:</span> I swear that Rebbi said that he is liable twice!</p>
<p class="bas indent1"><span class="nm">(n)</span><span class="cl">Bar Kapara:</span> I swear that Rebbi said that he is liable once!</p>
<p class="bas indent2"><span class="nm">1.</span><span class="cl">R. Chiya:</span> Shabbos was forbidden to all. It was permitted (for Avodah) only to Kohanim. He is liable for transgressing Shabbos, and for Avodas Zar.</p>
<p class="bas indent1"><span class="nm">(o)</span><span class="cl">Bar Kapara:</span> Shabbos was forbidden to all. It was permitted (Stam, i.e. to all). He is liable only for Avodas Zar.</p>
<p class="bas indent1"><span class="nm">(p)</span><span class="cl">(R. Chiya):</span> If a Kohen Ba'al Mum served in the Mikdash b'Tum'ah, he is liable for two Aveiros; (p)	(Bar Kapara): He is liable for one.</p>
<p class="bas indent1"><span class="nm">(q)</span>Each of them swore that Rebbi said like him.</p>
<p class="bas indent2"><span class="nm">1.</span><span class="cl">R. Chiya:</span> Avodah b'Tum'ah was forbidden to all. It was permitted only to unblemished Kohanim (for Korbanos Tzibur). He is liable for Avodas Ba'al Mum, and for serving b'Tum'ah.</p>
<p class="bas indent2"><span class="nm">2.</span><span class="cl">Bar Kapara:</span> Avodah b'Tum'ah was forbidden to all. It was permitted in the Mikdash (Stam). He is liable only for Avodas Ba'al Mum.</p>
<p class="bas indent1"><span class="nm">(r)</span><span class="cl">(R. Chiya):</span> If a Zar ate Melikah (Chatas ha'Of; it is killed through pinching its neck), he is liable twice;</p>

<p class="bas indent2"><span class="nm">1.</span><span class="cl">R. Chiya:</span> Eating Neveilah (something that died without Shechitah) was forbidden to all. It was permitted in the Mikdash only to Kohanim. He is liable for a Zar eating Kodshei Kodoshim, and for eating Neveilah.</p>
