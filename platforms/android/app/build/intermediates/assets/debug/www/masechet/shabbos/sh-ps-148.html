<p class="bas indent1"><span class="nm">(b)</span><span class="cl">(Rav Chana Bagdata'ah citing Shmuel):</span> [The correct text of the Mishnah, and] the Halachah is, one may return a broken bone.</p>
<p class="bas indent1"><span class="nm">(c)</span>Rabah bar bar Chanah visited Pumbadisa; he did not go to the lecture of Rav Yehudah. Rav Yehudah told an officer to grab him by the clothes until he comes.</p>
<p class="bas indent1"><span class="nm">(d)</span>Rabah found Rav Yehudah teaching 'One may not return a broken bone.'</p>
<p class="bas indent1"><span class="nm">(e)</span><span class="cl">(Rabah):</span> Rav Chana cited Shmuel to say that the Halachah is, one may return it!</p>
<p class="bas indent1"><span class="nm">(f)</span><span class="cl">Rav Yehudah:</span> Rav Chana and Shmuel are both from Bavel, yet I (in Bavel) did not hear this until you (from Eretz Yisrael) told us - it is good that I forced you to come!</p>
<p class="bas indent1"><span class="nm">(g)</span><span class="cl">(Mishnah):</span> If the hand or leg bone was dislocated...</p>
<p class="bas indent1"><span class="nm">(h)</span>Rav Avya's hand became dislocated; he was asking Rav Yosef about possible ways to return it - Rav Yosef forbade all of them. Amidst this, it snapped back into place.</p>
<p class="bas indent1"><span class="nm">(i)</span><span class="cl">Rav Yosef:</span> Why were you asking - the Mishnah says, if the hand or leg bone was dislocated, he may not shake it in water, but he may wash normally - if it heals, this is no problem.</p>
<p class="bas indent1"><span class="nm">(j)</span><span class="cl">Rav Avya:</span> It also forbids to reset a broken bone, yet Shmuel taught that the Halachah is, it is permitted!</p>
<p class="bas indent1"><span class="nm">(k)</span><span class="cl">Rav Yosef:</span> Not everything is the same - we change the text only where it was taught to do so.</p>

<p class="bas subject"><span class="nm">2)</span><i>SHINUYIM</i> TO PREVENT PERFORMING A <i>MELACHAH</i> ON SHABBOS</p>
<p class="bas indent1"><span class="nm">(a)</span><span class="cl">(Mishnah):</span> Reuven may Sho'el (borrow) barrels of wine or oil from his friend, as long as he does not say 'Halveni';</p>
<p class="bas indent1"><span class="nm">(b)</span>Similarly, a woman may Sho'el loaves from her friend [but may not say 'Halveni'].</p>
<p class="bas indent1"><span class="nm">(c)</span>If the lender does not trust Reuven, Reuven leaves his Talis with him, and they calculate [the value of what was lent] after Shabbos.</p>
<p class="bas indent1"><span class="nm">(d)</span>Similarly, when Erev Pesach is on Shabbos one [who needs to buy Korban Pesach] leaves his Talis with the seller, and they make a calculation after Yom Tov.</p>
<p class="bas indent1"><span class="nm">(e)</span><span class="cl">(Gemara - Rava bar Rav Chanan) Question:</span> What is the difference whether he says 'Hash'ileni' or 'Halveni'?</p>
<p class="bas indent1"><span class="nm">(f)</span><span class="cl">Answer (Abaye):</span> If he says 'Halveni', the lender is prone to write [details of the loan; Tosfos - this connotes a loan (usually food or money) in which the same item will not be returned; Rashi it is normally a 30 day loan];</p>
<p class="bas indent2"><span class="nm">1.</span>If he says 'Hash'ileni', we are not concerned lest he write (normally the same item lent (usually a Kli) is returned, or it is for less than 30 days).</p>
<p class="bas indent1"><span class="nm">(g)</span><span class="cl">Question (Rava):</span> Since during the week people are not particular, and sometimes say Hash'ileni in place of Halveni, and the lender writes, also on Shabbos we should be concerned, even if he says Hash'ileni the lender might write!</p>
<p class="bas indent1"><span class="nm">(h)</span><span class="cl">Answer (Abaye):</span> Since on Shabbos Hash'ileni is permitted and Halveni is forbidden, his intent is clear, the lender will not write.</p>
<p class="bas indent1"><span class="nm">(i)</span><span class="cl">Question (Rava bar Rav Chanan):</span> On Yom Tov, we do everything using the biggest Shinuy possible - why do women fill jugs [with water] normally?</p>
<p class="bas indent1"><span class="nm">(j)</span><span class="cl">Answer (Abaye):</span> There is no feasible Shinuy!</p>
<p class="bas indent2"><span class="nm">1.</span>If we will say that those who use big jugs [during the week] should use small ones [on Yom Tov], this will cause extra walking [to and from the well]!</p>
<p class="bas indent2"><span class="nm">2.</span>If we will say that those who normally use small jugs should use big ones, this will cause them to carry a larger load!</p>
<p class="bas bbbline">148b----------------------------------------148b</p>
<p class="bas indent2"><span class="nm">3.</span>If we will require to cover the jug with a garment, [it may get wet and] they might come to squeeze!</p>
<p class="bas indent2"><span class="nm">4.</span>If we will require to cover it with a lid, [people will tie it on,] perhaps the rope will snap and they might come to tie!</p>
<p class="bas indent1"><span class="nm">(k)</span><span class="cl">Question (Rava bar Rav Chanan - Mishnah):</span> On Yom Tov we may not clap hands on each other or over the heart (Rashi - on account of mourning; Tosfos - out of joy) or dance (lest one fix a musical instrument);</p>
<p class="bas indent2"><span class="nm">1.</span>People do this, and we do not protest!</p>
<p class="bas indent2"><span class="nm">2.</span><span class="cl">Counter-question (Abaye):</span> Rava taught that one should not sit even with the Lechi, lest something roll away, and he will retrieve it - people set jugs down and sit there, and we do not protest!</p>
<p class="bas indent1"><span class="nm">(l)</span><span class="cl">Answer to both questions (Abaye):</span> You must say that we are silent because [they will not listen, and] it is better that Yisraelim transgress b'Shogeg than b'Mezid!</p>
<p class="bas indent1"><span class="nm">(m)</span><span class="cl">Assumption:</span> This only applies to a transgression mid'Rabanan, but regarding mid'Oraisa, we protest even if they will not listen.</p>
<p class="bas indent1"><span class="nm">(n)</span><span class="cl">Rejection:</span> Mid'Oraisa, one must add to Yom Kipur (begin fasting before nightfall), yet some eat until night, and we do not protest! (Most say that the addition to the Isur Melachah of Yom Kipur [and Shabbos and Yom Tov] is also mid'Oraisa - Bi'ur Halachah 261 (Yesh Omrim). Rama - if the Torah explicitly forbids something, we protest even if they will not listen.)</p>

<p class="bas indent1"><span class="nm">(b)</span><span class="cl">Inference:</span> This is forbidden on Shabbos, it is permitted on a weekday.</p>
<p class="bas indent1"><span class="nm">(c)</span><span class="cl">Suggestion:</span> Our Mishnah is unlike Hillel!</p>
<p class="bas indent2"><span class="nm">1.</span><span class="cl">(Mishnah - Hillel):</span> A woman may not lend a loaf to her neighbor until she sets a price for it, lest wheat will rise in price and she will [return a loaf worth more, and] transgress usury!</p>
<p class="bas indent1"><span class="nm">(d)</span><span class="cl">Rejection:</span> It is even like Hillel - he discusses a place where they do not fix the price of bread, our Mishnah discusses a place where they do.</p>

<p class="bas indent1"><span class="nm">(f)</span><span class="cl">(Rav Yosef):</span> One cannot demand payment of a loan given on Yom Tov.</p>
<p class="bas indent1"><span class="nm">(g)</span><span class="cl">(Rabah):</span> One can demand payment.</p>
<p class="bas indent1"><span class="nm">(h)</span><span class="cl">(Rav Yosef):</span> One cannot demand payment - if he could, people would come to write it down!</p>
<p class="bas indent1"><span class="nm">(i)</span><span class="cl">(Rabah):</span> One can demand payment - if he could not, people would not lend, and others [who need to borrow] will not fulfill Simchas Yom Tov!</p>
<p class="bas indent1"><span class="nm">(j)</span><span class="cl">(Mishnah):</span> If the lender does not trust Reuven, Reuven leaves his Talis with him.</p>
<p class="bas indent1"><span class="nm">(k)</span><span class="cl">Question:</span> If one cannot demand payment, we understand why he leaves his Talis with him and makes a calculation after Shabbos;</p>
<p class="bas indent2"><span class="nm">1.</span>But if one can demand payment, there is no need for Reuven to leave his Talis!</p>
<p class="bas indent1"><span class="nm">(l)</span><span class="cl">Answer:</span> The lender prefers to have collateral to avoid the bother of claiming from him in Beis Din.</p>
<p class="bas indent1"><span class="nm">(m)</span><span class="cl">Question (Rav Idi bar Avin - Mishnah):</span> (Shemitah is Meshamet (cancels) debts owed at the end of the Shemitah year.) If Levi slaughtered a cow and divided the meat [among several buyers] on [the 30th day of Elul of Shemitah, which is usually Mekudash to be] Rosh Hashanah:</p>
<p class="bas indent2"><span class="nm">1.</span>If Elul was made full (the day was not Mekudash, it was Erev Rosh Hashanah, the debt was owed at the end of Shemitah), it is Meshamet;</p>
<p class="bas indent2"><span class="nm">2.</span>If not (the day was Rosh Hashanah, the debt began after Shemitah), it is not Meshamet.</p>
<p class="bas indent2"><span class="nm">3.</span>If one cannot demand payment, it is meaningless to say [in the Reisha] 'Meshamet'!</p>
<p class="bas indent1"><span class="nm">(n)</span><span class="cl">Answer:</span> [Even though we may not do Melachah on Elul 30, lest it be Mekudash to be Rosh Hashanah,] retroactively it was not Mekudash, so the law of a loan on Yom Tov does not apply.</p>
<p class="bas indent1"><span class="nm">(o)</span><span class="cl">Question (Seifa):</span> If not (the day was Rosh Hashanah), it is not Meshamet.</p>
<p class="bas indent2"><span class="nm">1.</span>This implies that one can demand payment!</p>
<p class="bas indent1"><span class="nm">(p)</span><span class="cl">Answer:</span> No, it means that if the buyer wants to pay, the seller may accept.</p>
<p class="bas indent1"><span class="nm">(q)</span><span class="cl">Question:</span> This implies that in the Reisha, the seller may not accept!</p>
<p class="bas indent1"><span class="nm">(r)</span><span class="cl">Answer:</span> In the Reisha, he must say 'I Meshamet!'; in the Seifa, he need not say this;</p>
<p class="bas indent2"><span class="nm">1.</span><span class="cl">(Mishnah):</span> If Reuven returns a debt from before Shemitah to Shimon, Shimon must say 'I Meshamet!'</p>
<p class="bas indent2"><span class="nm">2.</span>If Reuven says, 'Even so [I want to repay]', Shimon may take the money, for it says "V'Zeh <i>Devar</i> ha'Shemitah" (one must declare that he is Meshamet).</p>
<p class="bas indent1"><span class="nm">(s)</span>Rav Avya would take a security (when lending on Yom Tov); Rabah bar Ula would scheme [and take a security after Yom Tov - Rashi; R. Chananel - he would request a loan afterwards, then say 'I will keep this as payment for the loan of Yom Tov'].</p>
<p class="bas subject"><span class="nm">4)</span>MAY ONE BE <i>MAKDISH</i> ON SHABBOS AND YOM TOV?</p>
<p class="bas indent1"><span class="nm">(a)</span><span class="cl">(Mishnah):</span> Similarly, when Erev Pesach...</p>
<p class="bas indent1"><span class="nm">(b)</span><span class="cl">(R. Yochanan):</span> One may Makdish his Korban Pesach on Shabbos and his Chagigah (a Shelamim every man must offer on each festival) on Yom Tov.</p>
<p class="bas indent1"><span class="nm">(c)</span><span class="cl">Support (Mishnah):</span> Similarly, when Erev Pesach is on Shabbos one [who needs to buy an animal for Korban Pesach] leaves his Talis with the seller, and they make a calculation after Yom Tov.</p>
<p class="bas indent1"><span class="nm">(d)</span><span class="cl">Rejection:</span> The case is, the Korban was Hukdash before Shabbos, the buyer was merely Nimneh (bought a share of the meat; all the owners fulfill their obligation to offer Korban Pesach through this animal) on Shabbos.</p>
<p class="bas indent1"><span class="nm">(e)</span><span class="cl">Question (Mishnah):</span> On Yom Tov, one may not buy the rights to eat part of an animal.</p>
<p class="bas indent1"><span class="nm">(f)</span><span class="cl">Answer:</span> Here, [the case is] the buyer is regularly Nimneh on this seller's Pesach, therefore it is as if he was Nimneh from before Shabbos.</p>
<p class="bas indent1"><span class="nm">(g)</span><span class="cl">Question (R. Hoshaya's Beraisa):</span> One may go to a shepherd he knows well, take a lamb, Makdish it and offer it for Korban Pesach.</p>
<p class="bas indent1"><span class="nm">(h)</span><span class="cl">Answer:</span> Also there, the buyer regularly buys from the shepherd, the shepherd was Makdish the Pesach before Shabbos.</p>
<p class="bas indent1"><span class="nm">(i)</span><span class="cl">Question:</span> The Beraisa says that he (the buyer) is Makdish it!</p>
<p class="bas indent1"><span class="nm">(j)</span><span class="cl">Answer:</span> It is a Mid'Rabanan virtue for the buyer to declare it Hekdesh (but mid'Oraisa, this does nothing).</p>
<p class="bas indent1"><span class="nm">(k)</span><span class="cl">Question:</span> But R. Yochanan says that the Halachah follows a Stam Mishnah!</p>
<p class="bas indent2"><span class="nm">1.</span><span class="cl">(Mishnah):</span> On Yom Tov, one may not Makdish, Ma'arich (pledge to Hekdesh a person's Erech, an amount based on his age and gender), make Cherem (it is Hekdesh until it is given to a Kohen), or separate Terumos and Ma'aseros; all the more so these are forbidden on Shabbos.</p>
<p class="bas indent1"><span class="nm">(l)</span><span class="cl">Answer:</span> The Mishnah refers to Korbanos without a fixed time, R. Yochanan discusses Korbanos with a fixed time.</p>
