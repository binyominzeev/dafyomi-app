<p class="bas indent1"><span class="nm">(a)</span><span class="cl">Version #1 - Question (Rav Bivi bar Abaye):</span> If Reuven stuck a dough in an oven on Shabbos, may he remove it before it bakes, to avoid a Chiyuv Chatas?</p>
<p class="bas indent2"><span class="nm">1.</span><span class="cl">Question (Rav Acha bar Abaye):</span> What is the case?</p>
<p class="bas indent3"><span class="nm">i.</span>If he put it in b'Shogeg and is still Shogeg, the law is irrelevant (he is unaware of any transgression, surely he will leave it in!)</p>
<p class="bas indent2"><span class="nm">2.</span><span class="cl">Answer #1:</span> Rather, he put it in b'Shogeg and later remembered.</p>
<p class="bas indent2"><span class="nm">3.</span><span class="cl">Objection:</span> If so, he cannot be Chayav Chatas!</p>
<p class="bas indent3"><span class="nm">i.</span><span class="cl">(Mishnah):</span> One is not Chayav Chatas unless he was Shogeg at the beginning and at the end.</p>
<p class="bas indent2"><span class="nm">4.</span><span class="cl">Answer #2:</span> Rather, he was Mezid.</p>
<p class="bas indent2"><span class="nm">5.</span><span class="cl">Objection:</span> If so, it should say '...To avoid an Isur Skilah (stoning)'!</p>
<p class="bas indent2"><span class="nm">6.</span><span class="cl">Answer #3 (Rav Shila):</span> Really, he was Shogeg;</p>
<p class="bas indent3"><span class="nm">i.</span>Rav Bivi's question was whether or not someone else [who knows that Reuven is transgressing] may remove it to exempt him.</p>
<p class="bas indent2"><span class="nm">7.</span><span class="cl">Objection:</span> One may not sin (even mid'Rabanan) in order to save someone else from sin!</p>
<p class="bas indent2"><span class="nm">8.</span><span class="cl">Defense of Answer #2 (Rav Ashi):</span> Really, he was Mezid; it should say 'To avoid an Isur Skilah.'</p>
<p class="bas indent1"><span class="nm">(b)</span><span class="cl">Version #2 - Rav Acha brei d'Rava - (Rav Bivi bar Abaye):</span> If Reuven stuck a dough in an oven on Shabbos, he may (Tosfos - some texts say 'may he', it is a question) remove it, to avoid an Isur Skilah.</p>
<p class="bas subject"><span class="nm">2)</span><i>AKIRAH</i> AND <i>HANACHAH</i> REQUIRE A SUBSTANTIAL PLACE</p>
<p class="bas indent1"><span class="nm">(a)</span><span class="cl">(Mishnah):</span> If the Oni put his hand inside...[and put an object in the hand of the Ba'al ha'Bayis, he is Chayav].</p>
<p class="bas indent1"><span class="nm">(b)</span><span class="cl">Question:</span> Why is he Chayav? Akirah and Hanachah must be from [and on] a place that is four by four [Tefachim; a hand is much smaller]!</p>
<p class="bas indent1"><span class="nm">(c)</span><span class="cl">Answer #1 (Rabah):</span> The Mishnah is like R. Akiva, who does not require a place that is four by four:</p>
<p class="bas indent2"><span class="nm">1.</span><span class="cl">(Mishnah - R. Akiva):</span> If one throws from a Reshus ha'Yachid to another Reshus ha'Yachid and Reshus ha'Rabim is in between, he is liable;</p>
<p class="bas indent2"><span class="nm">2.</span>Chachamim exempt.</p>
<p class="bas indent2"><span class="nm">3.</span>R. Akiva holds Kelutah k'Mi she'Hunchah (something in the air is considered to be at rest), Chachamim do not say Kelutah k'Mi she'Hunchah.</p>
<p class="bas indent2"><span class="nm">4.</span><span class="cl">Question:</span> This implies that Rabah is sure that the case is (that he threw) within 10 Tefachim of the ground, and they argue about Kelutah k'Mi she'Hunchah - but he was unsure about this!</p>
<p class="bas bbbline">4b----------------------------------------4b</p>
<p class="bas indent3"><span class="nm">i.</span><span class="cl">Question (Rabah):</span> In what case do they argue?</p>
<p class="bas indent3"><span class="nm">ii.</span>Perhaps they argue within 10 Tefachim, whether or not Kelutah k'Mi she'Hunchah, but all exempt above 10, no one learns throwing from Moshit (passing an object from one Reshus ha'Yachid to another, through Reshus ha'Rabim);</p>
<p class="bas indent3"><span class="nm">iii.</span>Or, they argue above 10 Tefachim, R. Akiva learns throwing from Moshit, Chachamim do not - but all Mechayev below 10, Kelutah k'Mi she'Hunchah.</p>
<p class="bas indent2"><span class="nm">5.</span><span class="cl">Answer:</span> Rabah later answered his own question (they argue below 10.)</p>
<p class="bas indent1"><span class="nm">(d)</span><span class="cl">Rejection:</span> Perhaps R. Akiva does not require Hanachah on a place that is four by four, but he requires Akirah from a place that is four by four:</p>
<p class="bas indent1"><span class="nm">(e)</span><span class="cl">Answer #2 (to Question (b) - Rav Yosef):</span> Our Mishnah is like Rebbi.</p>
<p class="bas indent1"><span class="nm">(f)</span><span class="cl">Question:</span> Like which teaching of Rebbi is it?</p>
<p class="bas indent1"><span class="nm">(g)</span><span class="cl">Answer #1 (Beraisa - Rebbi):</span> If one threw something [in Reshus ha'Rabim] and it landed on a ledge of any size, he is liable;</p>
<p class="bas indent2"><span class="nm">1.</span>Chachamim exempt.</p>
<p class="bas indent1"><span class="nm">(h)</span><span class="cl">Rejection:</span> No - Abaye explained, the Beraisa discusses a tree in Reshus ha'Yachid, its foliage hangs into Reshus ha'Rabim, the thrown object landed on the foliage;</p>
<p class="bas indent2"><span class="nm">1.</span>Rebbi applies the status of the trunk (Rashi - it is four by four; Tosfos - and it is Reshus ha'Yachid) to the foliage, Chachamim do not. (Tosfos ha'Rosh - just like Abaye taught that Rebbi considers the foliage to be Reshus ha'Yachid on account of the trunk, we can say that Rebbi considers the foliage to be four by four on account of the trunk.)</p>
