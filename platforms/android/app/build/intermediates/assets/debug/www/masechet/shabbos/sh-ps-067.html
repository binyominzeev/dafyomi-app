<p class="bas indent1"><span class="nm">(c)</span><span class="cl">Objection (Rav Acha brei d'Rava):</span> It would be better to say "Al Tikrav Halom" (it should not return)!</p>

<p class="bas indent1"><span class="nm">(c)</span><span class="cl">Answer #1 (R. Oshaya):</span> It is R. Shimon ben Gamliel, who says that Benei Yisrael are Benei Melachim.</p>
<p class="bas indent1"><span class="nm">(d)</span><span class="cl">Answer #2 (Rava):</span> All agree with our Mishnah - the bells are woven into the garment (so there is no concern that one will remove it to avoid appearing haughty).</p>

<p class="bas indent1"><span class="nm">(d)</span>The tooth of a fox is for sleep - a tooth from a live fox helps one who sleeps too much, a tooth from a dead fox helps one to sleep.</p>

<p class="bas indent2"><span class="nm">1.</span>We understand putting stones on it (this will weaken it, so it will not cast down its produce), but there is no sound reason for the ribbon!</p>

<p class="bas indent2"><span class="nm">2.</span>If a fishbone is stuck in the foodpipe, we say 'Ninatzta k'Machat...'</p>

<p class="bas indent2"><span class="nm">1.</span>A case occurred, R. Akiva made a [wedding] feast for his son - on every cup of wine he said 'Wine and life according to [the guidelines of] Rabanan, wine and life according to Rabanan and their Talmidim'.</p>
