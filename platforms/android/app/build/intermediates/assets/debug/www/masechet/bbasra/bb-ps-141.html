<p class="bas subject"><span class="nm">1)</span>GIFTS TO SONS AND DAUGHTERS</p>
<p class="bas indent1"><span class="nm">(a)</span><span class="cl">(Mishnah):</span> If a man said 'if my wife will give birth...</p>
<p class="bas indent1"><span class="nm">(b)</span><span class="cl">Inference:</span> A man prefers daughters to sons (he gives more to a daughter)!</p>
<p class="bas indent1"><span class="nm">(c)</span><span class="cl">Question:</span> R. Yochanan taught that Hash-m hates one who dies without a son to inherit him;</p>
<p class="bas indent2"><span class="nm">1.</span>It says "<i>v'Ha'avartem</i> Es Nachalso l'Vito", which is similar to "Yom Evrah (Gehinom)".</p>
<p class="bas indent1"><span class="nm">(d)</span><span class="cl">Answer #1:</span> Regarding inheritance, a son is better (the property is called by the father's name and stays inside his tribe);</p>
<p class="bas indent2"><span class="nm">1.</span>When giving a gift, men give more to daughters (it is abnormal for them to beg for food).</p>
<p class="bas indent1"><span class="nm">(e)</span><span class="cl">Answer #2 (Shmuel):</span> The Mishnah discusses a man about to have his first child.</p>
<p class="bas indent2"><span class="nm">1.</span><span class="cl">(Rav Chisda):</span> If the first child is a daughter, it is a good sign.</p>
<p class="bas indent2"><span class="nm">2.</span><span class="cl">Version #1:</span> This is because she helps raise future children.</p>
<p class="bas indent2"><span class="nm">3.</span><span class="cl">Version #2:</span> This is because there is no Ayin ha'Ra'ah (jealousy. A male firstborn receives a double portion. This arouses Ayin ha'Ra'ah.)</p>
<p class="bas indent2"><span class="nm">4.</span><span class="cl">(Rav Chisda):</span> I prefer daughters.</p>
<p class="bas indent1"><span class="nm">(f)</span><span class="cl">Answer #3:</span> R. Yehudah taught our Mishnah (we now explain this).</p>
<p class="bas indent1"><span class="nm">(g)</span><span class="cl">Question:</span> From which teaching of R. Yehudah do we see that a man prefers (giving money to) daughters?</p>
<p class="bas indent2"><span class="nm">1.</span><span class="cl">Suggestion (Beraisa - R. Meir):</span> "Va'Shem Berach Es Avraham ba'Kol" - he did not have a daughter;</p>
<p class="bas indent3"><span class="nm">i.</span>R. Yehudah says, this teaches that he had a daughter named 'Bakol'.</p>
<p class="bas indent2"><span class="nm">2.</span><span class="cl">Rejection:</span> R. Yehudah teaches that Hash-m gave Avraham everything. This does not show that a daughter is preferable to a son!</p>
<p class="bas indent1"><span class="nm">(h)</span><span class="cl">Answer (Beraisa - R. Meir):</span> It is a Mitzvah to feed daughters, and all the more so to feed sons;</p>
<p class="bas indent2"><span class="nm">1.</span>This is because sons learn Torah;</p>
<p class="bas indent1"><span class="nm">(i)</span>R. Yehudah says, it is a Mitzvah to feed sons, and all the more so daughters.</p>
<p class="bas indent2"><span class="nm">1.</span>This is so they will not be disgraced.</p>
<p class="bas indent1"><span class="nm">(j)</span><span class="cl">(Beraisa):</span> If she gave birth to a male and female, he receives 150 (silver Zuzim, which is six gold Dinarim), and she receives 50 Zuz.</p>
<p class="bas indent1"><span class="nm">(k)</span><span class="cl">Question:</span> What is the case?</p>
<p class="bas indent1"><span class="nm">(l)</span><span class="cl">Answer (Rav Ashi):</span> The father stipulated about twins, and made it contingent on which would be born first;</p>
<p class="bas indent2"><span class="nm">1.</span>He said 'if she will give birth to a male then to a female, he should receive 200, and she receives nothing. if she will give birth to a female then to a male, they will receive 100 each.'</p>
<p class="bas indent2"><span class="nm">2.</span>She gave birth to both, and we do not know which was first. In any case, the son receives at least 100;</p>
<p class="bas indent3"><span class="nm">i.</span>We are in doubt about who receives the other 100, therefore they divide it.</p>
<p class="bas indent1"><span class="nm">(m)</span><span class="cl">(Beraisa):</span> If she gave birth to a male and a female, he only receives 100.</p>
<p class="bas indent1"><span class="nm">(n)</span><span class="cl">Question:</span> What is the case?</p>
<p class="bas indent1"><span class="nm">(o)</span><span class="cl">Answer (Ravina):</span> He stipulated to pay the first person to inform him about his first child.</p>
<p class="bas bbbline">141b----------------------------------------141b</p>
<p class="bas indent2"><span class="nm">1.</span><span class="cl">Version #1 - our text - (Beraisa):</span> If one said 'the first person who will tell me that my wife gave birth to a male, I will give to him 100', if she gave birth to a male, the informer receives 100;</p>
<p class="bas indent2"><span class="nm">2.</span>If he said 'the first who will tell me that she gave birth to a female, I will give to him 100', if she gave birth to a female, he receives 100;</p>
<p class="bas indent2"><span class="nm">3.</span><span class="cl">Version #2 - Rashbam - (Beraisa):</span> If one said 'the first person who will tell me that my wife gave birth to a male, or who will tell me that she gave birth to a female, I will give to him 100', and she gave birth to a male or female, the informer receives 100; (end of Version #2)</p>
<p class="bas indent2"><span class="nm">4.</span>If she gave birth to a male and female, he only receives 100.</p>
<p class="bas indent2"><span class="nm">5.</span><span class="cl">Question:</span> He did not promise to give anything in this case!</p>
<p class="bas indent2"><span class="nm">6.</span><span class="cl">Answer:</span> The case is, he said also '...or who will tell me that she gave birth to a male and female, I will give to him 100'.</p>
<p class="bas indent2"><span class="nm">7.</span><span class="cl">Question:</span> In any case, the informer receives 100. Why didn't he say 'whoever tells me the gender of my first child(ren) will receive 100'? (Why did he specify the different cases?)</p>
<p class="bas indent2"><span class="nm">8.</span><span class="cl">Answer:</span> He excludes a Nafel (stillborn baby. In this case, the informer receives nothing).</p>
<p class="bas subject"><span class="nm">2)</span>A KINYAN ON BEHALF OF A FETUS</p>
<p class="bas indent1"><span class="nm">(a)</span>A man told his pregnant wife 'my property is to the child you are carrying.'</p>
<p class="bas indent1"><span class="nm">(b)</span><span class="cl">(Rav Huna):</span> A Kinyan on behalf of a fetus is invalid.</p>
<p class="bas indent1"><span class="nm">(c)</span><span class="cl">Question (Rav Nachman - Mishnah):</span> If a man said 'if my wife will give birth to a male, he should receive 100 Zuz', we fulfill his words.</p>
<p class="bas indent1"><span class="nm">(d)</span><span class="cl">Rav Huna:</span> I cannot explain our Mishnah. I do not know a Tana who holds like this!</p>
<p class="bas indent1"><span class="nm">(e)</span><span class="cl">Question:</span> Why didn't he say that the Mishnah is R. Meir, who says that one can transfer ownership of something that is not yet in the world?</p>
<p class="bas indent1"><span class="nm">(f)</span><span class="cl">Answer:</span> R. Meir said that one can transfer ownership of something that is not yet in the world to someone who is already in the world. He never discussed giving <i>to</i> something not yet in the world.</p>
<p class="bas indent1"><span class="nm">(g)</span><span class="cl">Question:</span> Why didn't he say that the Mishnah is R. Yosi?</p>
<p class="bas indent2"><span class="nm">1.</span><span class="cl">(Mishnah - R. Yosi):</span> A fetus disqualifies slaves (that he will inherit from his father, a Kohen) from eating Terumah. He does not permit his mother to eat Terumah. (Until he is born, he is not considered a Kohen. The first law teaches that a fetus already owns what he will inherit!)</p>
<p class="bas indent1"><span class="nm">(h)</span><span class="cl">Answer:</span> Inheritance is different than Kinyan, for it happens automatically.</p>
<p class="bas indent1"><span class="nm">(i)</span><span class="cl">Question:</span> Why didn't he say that the Mishnah is R. Yochanan ben Brokah, who says that a man can transfer inheritance in an expression of inheritance or gift?</p>
<p class="bas indent2"><span class="nm">1.</span><span class="cl">(Mishnah - R. Yochanan ben Brokah):</span> (If Reuven said 'Ploni will inherit me',) it takes effect if Ploni could inherit him. Our Mishnah did not specify how the fetus should receive the money. Since the fetus will inherit him, presumably, it should be like an inheritance!)</p>
<p class="bas indent1"><span class="nm">(j)</span><span class="cl">Answer:</span> R. Yochanan ben Brokah said that one can transfer inheritance to someone already in the world. He never discussed giving to someone not yet in the world.</p>
<p class="bas indent1"><span class="nm">(k)</span><span class="cl">Question:</span> Why didn't he say that the Mishnah is R. Yochanan ben Brokah, and he holds like R. Yosi (that a fetus inherits)?</p>
<p class="bas indent1"><span class="nm">(l)</span><span class="cl">Answer:</span> We have no source to say that he holds like R. Yosi.</p>
<p class="bas indent1"><span class="nm">(m)</span><span class="cl">Question:</span> Why didn't he say that the case is that he stipulated to pay the first person to inform him about his first child?</p>
<p class="bas indent1"><span class="nm">(n)</span><span class="cl">Answer (Seifa):</span> If (she gave birth to a Tumtum and) there are no other heirs, he inherits everything.</p>
<p class="bas indent2"><span class="nm">1.</span>Clearly, the Mishnah does not discuss an informer!</p>
<p class="bas indent1"><span class="nm">(o)</span><span class="cl">Question:</span> Why didn't he say that the Mishnah discusses when he gave the gift after his child was born (before he heard its gender)?</p>
<p class="bas indent1"><span class="nm">(p)</span><span class="cl">Answer (Mishnah):</span> If he said 'whatever she will give birth to...'</p>
<p class="bas indent2"><span class="nm">1.</span>If the baby was already born, it should say 'whatever she <i>gave</i> birth to...'</p>
<p class="bas indent1"><span class="nm">(q)</span><span class="cl">Question:</span> Why didn't he say that the Mishnah discusses one who said '<i>when</i> she will give birth, the baby will receive...'</p>
<p class="bas indent1"><span class="nm">(r)</span><span class="cl">Answer:</span> Rav Huna holds that even if one says '<i>when</i> she will give birth...', the baby does not acquire.</p>
