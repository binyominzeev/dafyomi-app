<p class="bas subject"><span class="nm">1)</span><i>CHALIPIN</i> WHEN ONE IS PARTICULAR ABOUT THE VALUE OF THE ITEMS</p>
<p class="bas indent1"><span class="nm">(a)</span><span class="cl">(Rabah citing Rav Huna):</span> If Reuven held up money and said 'sell me your item for this', and Shimon agreed (even though he could not see how much money it was), the acquisition works, and Shimon can claim the Ona'ah. (If the money is a sixth less than the item's value, Reuven must give the amount he underpaid.)</p>
<p class="bas indent2"><span class="nm">1.</span>The acquisition works, even though Reuven did not do Meshichah. Since Shimon was not concerned to see how much money was paid, this acquires, like Chalipin;</p>
<p class="bas indent2"><span class="nm">2.</span>Shimon can claim the Ona'ah. Since he said 'sell', and not 'trade,' it is a sale (to which the law of Ona'ah applies), and it is not Chalipin.</p>
<p class="bas indent1"><span class="nm">(b)</span><span class="cl">(Rav Aba citing Rav Huna):</span> If Reuven held up money and said 'sell to me your item for this', and Shimon agreed, the acquisition works, and Shimon cannot claim the Ona'ah.</p>
<p class="bas indent1"><span class="nm">(c)</span>Both agree that if the seller is not concerned to see how much money was paid, this acquires, like Chalipin.</p>
<p class="bas indent1"><span class="nm">(d)</span><span class="cl">Question:</span> What is the law of Chalipin when the seller is particular about how much money was paid? (Is it like a Kinyan Kesef, and it is not final until Meshichah is done?)</p>
<p class="bas indent1"><span class="nm">(e)</span><span class="cl">Answer (Rav Ada bar Ahavah - Beraisa):</span> If Reuven wanted to exchange his cow for Shimon's donkey, and after asking each other the price, Shimon was Moshech the cow, and the donkey died before Reuven was Moshech it, the cow was not acquired.</p>
<p class="bas indent2"><span class="nm">1.</span>This teaches that when the seller is concerned about how much money is paid, it is like a regular sale.</p>
<p class="bas indent1"><span class="nm">(f)</span><span class="cl">Objection (Rava):</span> People always care about the value, even in Chalipin!</p>
<p class="bas indent2"><span class="nm">1.</span>The Beraisa discusses when Shimon wanted a cow and a lamb for his donkey. Since he was Moshech only the cow, the acquisition was never completed.</p>
<p class="bas indent1"><span class="nm">(g)</span><span class="cl">(Rav Huna):</span> If Reuven held up money and said 'sell me your item for this', and Shimon agreed, the acquisition works, and Shimon can claim the Ona'ah.</p>
<p class="bas indent1"><span class="nm">(h)</span><span class="cl">Suggestion:</span> Rav Huna (who says that he acquires because it is like Chalipin) says that coins can be acquired through Chalipin.</p>
<p class="bas indent1"><span class="nm">(i)</span><span class="cl">Rejection:</span> No. Rather, he agrees with R. Yochanan, that mid'Oraisa, money acquires Metaltelim;</p>
<p class="bas indent2"><span class="nm">1.</span>Chachamim enacted that Meshichah acquires (and not money), lest someone sell something in his house and be slothful about saving it from a fire, for it already belongs to the buyer and he has nothing to gain by saving it;</p>
<p class="bas indent2"><span class="nm">2.</span>Chachamim decreed only in the usual case (when the seller is concerned about the money). In this case, we rule that the money acquires without Meshichah.</p>
<p class="bas indent1"><span class="nm">(j)</span><span class="cl">(Mar Huna brei d'Rav Nachman):</span> We learned that Rav Huna explicitly said that coins cannot be acquired through Chalipin.</p>
<p class="bas subject"><span class="nm">2)</span>THE <i>KELI</i> FOR <i>CHALIPIN</i></p>
<p class="bas indent1"><span class="nm">(a)</span><span class="cl">Question:</span> Whose Kli is used to do Chalipin?</p>
<p class="bas indent1"><span class="nm">(b)</span><span class="cl">Answer #1 (Rav):</span> The buyer's Kli is used. He wants the seller to get his Kli, in order that the seller will resolve absolutely that the buyer acquire the commodity.</p>
<p class="bas indent1"><span class="nm">(c)</span><span class="cl">Answer #2 (Levi):</span> The seller's is used (we will explain why later).</p>
<p class="bas indent1"><span class="nm">(d)</span><span class="cl">Question (Rav Huna of Diskarta):</span> According to Levi, the seller gives land (through Chalipin) through giving a Kli. A Mishnah teaches just the contrary!</p>
<p class="bas indent2"><span class="nm">1.</span><span class="cl">(Mishnah):</span> Metaltelim are acquired along with land.</p>
<p class="bas indent1"><span class="nm">(e)</span><span class="cl">Answer (Rava):</span> The Kli does not acquire the land. Rather, with the pleasure the seller gets that the buyer accepted his Kli, he resolves to give the land.</p>
<p class="bas indent1"><span class="nm">(f)</span>Tana'im argue like Rav and Levi argue.</p>
<p class="bas indent2"><span class="nm">1.</span><span class="cl">(Beraisa):</span> "Al ha'Ge'ulah... he gave his shoe to the other." "Ge'ulah" refers to a sale; "Te'udah" refers to Chalipin;</p>
<p class="bas indent2"><span class="nm">2.</span><span class="cl">Question:</span> "Lekayem Kol Davar Shalaf Ish Na'alo" - who gave his shoe to whom?</p>
<p class="bas indent2"><span class="nm">3.</span><span class="cl">Answer #1:</span> Boaz (who acquired rights to redeem the field) gave to the (closer) redeemer.</p>
<p class="bas indent2"><span class="nm">4.</span><span class="cl">Answer #2 (R. Yehudah):</span> The redeemer gave to Boaz.</p>
<p class="bas indent1"><span class="nm">(g)</span><span class="cl">(Beraisa):</span> A Kli does Chalipin, even if it is not worth a Perutah.</p>
<p class="bas indent1"><span class="nm">(h)</span><span class="cl">(Rav Nachman):</span> That refers only to a Kli, but Peros do not work.</p>
<p class="bas indent1"><span class="nm">(i)</span><span class="cl">(Rav Sheshes):</span> Even Peros work.</p>
<p class="bas indent1"><span class="nm">(j)</span><span class="cl">Question:</span> What is Rav Nachman's reason?</p>
<p class="bas indent1"><span class="nm">(k)</span><span class="cl">Answer:</span> The verse discusses a shoe (to show that a Kli is needed)!</p>
<p class="bas indent1"><span class="nm">(l)</span><span class="cl">Question:</span> How does Rav Sheshes explain this?</p>
<p class="bas indent1"><span class="nm">(m)</span><span class="cl">Answer:</span> "Na'alo" teaches that something specific must be used. This excludes half a fruit (when he did not specify which half).</p>
<p class="bas indent1"><span class="nm">(n)</span><span class="cl">Question (Rav Sheshes brei d'Rav Idi):</span> We write in documents '(we acquired) with a Kli proper to acquire with it.' Whom is this like?</p>
<p class="bas indent1"><span class="nm">(o)</span><span class="cl">Answer:</span> 'A Kli' excludes Rav Sheshes' opinion, that Peros make Chalipin. 'Proper' excludes Shmuel's opinion, that Maroka (Rashi - Kelim of dung; Tosfos - date pits) may be used;</p>
<p class="bas bbbline">47b----------------------------------------47b</p>
<p class="bas indent2"><span class="nm">1.</span>'To acquire' - not to make (the other) acquire (i.e. the Kli is of the one acquiring);</p>
<p class="bas indent2"><span class="nm">2.</span><span class="cl">Version #1 (Rav Papa):</span> 'With it' excludes coins;</p>
<p class="bas indent2"><span class="nm">3.</span><span class="cl">(Rav Zvid):</span> 'With it' excludes something forbidden to benefit from it.</p>
<p class="bas indent2"><span class="nm">4.</span><span class="cl">Version #2 (Rav Papa):</span> 'With it' excludes coins;</p>
<p class="bas indent2"><span class="nm">5.</span><span class="cl">(Rav Zvid):</span> 'Valid' excludes something forbidden to benefit from it;</p>
<p class="bas indent3"><span class="nm">i.</span>Obviously, Maroka is invalid. The text need not allude to it.</p>
<p class="bas subject"><span class="nm">3)</span>AN <i>ASIMON</i></p>
<p class="bas indent1"><span class="nm">(a)</span><span class="cl">(Mishnah):</span> An Asimon acquires coins...</p>
<p class="bas indent1"><span class="nm">(b)</span><span class="cl">Question:</span> What is an Asimon?</p>
<p class="bas indent1"><span class="nm">(c)</span><span class="cl">Answer #1 (Rav):</span> It is a coin given for a sign in the bathhouse (that one paid for a bath).</p>
<p class="bas indent1"><span class="nm">(d)</span><span class="cl">Question (Mishnah):</span> We cannot redeem Ma'aser Sheni on an Asimon, nor on coins given like a sign in the bathhouse.</p>
<p class="bas indent2"><span class="nm">1.</span>This shows that they are two different things!</p>
<p class="bas indent2"><span class="nm">2.</span><span class="cl">Suggestion:</span> The Mishnah explains that an Asimon is a coin given for a sign in the bathhouse.</p>
<p class="bas indent2"><span class="nm">3.</span><span class="cl">Rejection (Mishnah - R. Dosa):</span> We can not redeem Ma'aser Sheni on an Asimon;</p>
<p class="bas indent2"><span class="nm">4.</span>Chachamim say, we can redeem on it;</p>
<p class="bas indent3"><span class="nm">i.</span>Both agree that we cannot redeem on coins given for a sign in the bathhouse.</p>
<p class="bas indent1"><span class="nm">(e)</span><span class="cl">Answer #2 (R. Yochanan):</span> Rather, an Asimon is a blank coin.</p>
<p class="bas indent1"><span class="nm">(f)</span>This is like R. Yochanan said elsewhere.</p>
<p class="bas indent2"><span class="nm">1.</span><span class="cl">(R. Yochanan):</span> R. Dosa (brought above) and R. Yishmael agree with each other.</p>
<p class="bas indent2"><span class="nm">2.</span><span class="cl">(Beraisa - R. Yishmael):</span> "V'Tzarta ha'Kesef b'Yadecha" includes anything that may be Nitzrar (wrapped) in the hand;</p>
<p class="bas indent2"><span class="nm">3.</span>R. Akiva says, this includes any coin that has a Tzurah (form, i.e. mintage).</p>
<p class="bas subject"><span class="nm">4)</span>ACQUISITION OF <i>METALTELIM</i></p>
<p class="bas indent1"><span class="nm">(a)</span><span class="cl">(Mishnah):</span> If Reuven made Meshichah on Shimon's Peros to buy them and did not yet pay, Shimon cannot retract...</p>
<p class="bas indent1"><span class="nm">(b)</span><span class="cl">(R. Yochanan):</span> Mid'Oraisa, money acquires Metaltelim;</p>
<p class="bas indent2"><span class="nm">1.</span>Chachamim enacted that Meshichah acquires (and not money), lest one sell something in his house, and then tell the buyer 'it burned in a fire.'</p>
<p class="bas indent2"><span class="nm">2.</span><span class="cl">Objection:</span> The buyer will collect from the one responsible for the fire!</p>
<p class="bas indent2"><span class="nm">3.</span><span class="cl">Retraction:</span> Rather, the concern is lest a fire erupt through Ones;</p>
<p class="bas indent3"><span class="nm">i.</span>If the item belongs to the seller (until Meshichah), he will strive to save it. If it belongs to the buyer, he will not strive to save it.</p>
<p class="bas indent1"><span class="nm">(c)</span><span class="cl">(Reish Lakish):</span> The Torah explicitly teaches that Meshichah acquires.</p>
<p class="bas indent1"><span class="nm">(d)</span><span class="cl">Question:</span> What is the source?</p>
<p class="bas indent1"><span class="nm">(e)</span><span class="cl">Answer:</span> "Kanoh <i>mi'Yad</i> Amisecha" refers to something that is passed from hand to hand.</p>
<p class="bas indent1"><span class="nm">(f)</span>R. Yochanan explains that "mi'Yad" excludes land from the law of Ona'ah.</p>
<p class="bas indent1"><span class="nm">(g)</span><span class="cl">Reish Lakish:</span> To teach only that, it should have said 'when you will sell mi'Yad Amisecha.' "Oh Kano" is extra, to teach Meshichah.</p>
<p class="bas indent1"><span class="nm">(h)</span><span class="cl">Question:</span> What does R. Yochanan learn from "Oh Kano"?</p>
<p class="bas indent1"><span class="nm">(i)</span><span class="cl">Answer (Beraisa):</span> "V'Chi Timkeru Memkar... Al Tonu" would teach (forbid) only when the buyer was afflicted (overpaid);</p>
<p class="bas indent2"><span class="nm">1.</span>"Oh Kano... Al Tonu" includes when the seller was afflicted (the buyer underpaid).</p>
<p class="bas indent1"><span class="nm">(j)</span>Reish Lakish learns both laws from "Oh Kano."</p>
<p class="bas indent1"><span class="nm">(k)</span><span class="cl">Question (against Reish Lakish - Mishnah - R. Shimon):</span> Whoever is holding the money has the upper hand;</p>
<p class="bas indent2"><span class="nm">1.</span>The seller can retract, but the buyer cannot.</p>
<p class="bas indent2"><span class="nm">2.</span>Granted, if (mid'Oraisa) coins acquire, it sufficed to enact that the seller can retract (he will save the item in order to profit. If it rises in value, he will cancel the sale.)</p>
<p class="bas indent2"><span class="nm">3.</span>But according to Reish Lakish, coins do not acquire (mid'Oraisa or mid'Rabanan). Why can't the buyer retract?</p>
<p class="bas indent1"><span class="nm">(l)</span><span class="cl">Answer (Reish Lakish):</span> Indeed, R. Shimon holds like R. Yochanan. I explain Chachamim.</p>
<p class="bas indent1"><span class="nm">(m)</span><span class="cl">Question:</span> According to Reish Lakish, we understand the argument between Chachamim and R. Shimon;</p>
<p class="bas indent2"><span class="nm">1.</span>According to R. Yochanan, what do they argue about?</p>
<p class="bas indent1"><span class="nm">(n)</span><span class="cl">Answer:</span> They argue about Rav Chisda's law;</p>
<p class="bas indent2"><span class="nm">1.</span><span class="cl">(Rav Chisda):</span> Just like it was enacted that sellers can retract until Meshichah was done, also regarding buyers.</p>
<p class="bas indent2"><span class="nm">2.</span>Chachamim hold like Rav Chisda, and R. Shimon does not.</p>
