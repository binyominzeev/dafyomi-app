<p class="bas indent1"><span class="nm">(a)</span><span class="cl">(Mishnah):</span> If one vowed from milk, he may have Kum (water which separates from the milk);</p>
<p class="bas indent1"><span class="nm">(b)</span>R. Yosi forbids.</p>
<p class="bas indent1"><span class="nm">(c)</span>If he vowed from Kum, he may have milk.</p>
<p class="bas indent1"><span class="nm">(d)</span>Aba Sha'ul says, if one vowed from cheese, he is forbidden both salted and unsalted cheese.</p>
<p class="bas indent1"><span class="nm">(e)</span>If he vowed from meat, he may have gravy and Kipah (tiny pieces of meat at the bottom of the pot);</p>
<p class="bas indent1"><span class="nm">(f)</span>R. Yehudah forbids.</p>
<p class="bas indent1"><span class="nm">(g)</span><span class="cl">R. Yehudah:</span> A case occurred, and R. Tarfon forbade eggs cooked with the meat!</p>
<p class="bas indent1"><span class="nm">(h)</span><span class="cl">Chachamim:</span> The case was, he said 'this meat';</p>

<p class="bas subject"><span class="nm">2)</span>VOWS DEPEND ON THE WAY PEOPLE SPEAK</p>
<p class="bas indent1"><span class="nm">(a)</span><span class="cl">(Gemara) Contradiction (Mishnah):</span> If one vowed from lentils, he is forbidden Ashishim (the waste of lentils (Tosfos, Rosh) or lentils fried in honey (Ran));</p>
<p class="bas indent2"><span class="nm">1.</span>R. Yosi permits. (Tosfos, Rosh - he and Chachamim switched their opinions about whether or not by-products are forbidden. Ran - we ask only against R. Yosi, who forbids by-products but permits a special form of the Isur itself.)</p>
<p class="bas indent1"><span class="nm">(b)</span><span class="cl">Answer:</span> We explain vows according to the way people speak;</p>
<p class="bas indent2"><span class="nm">1.</span>In Chachamim's region, milk is called milk, and Kum is called Kum;</p>
<p class="bas indent2"><span class="nm">2.</span>In R. Yosi's region, Kum is also called Kum of milk. (Rosh - and in Chachamim's region, Ashishim are called Ashishim of lentils, but not in R. Yosi's region. Alternatively, Chachamim call a waste product by the name of its source, and R. Yosi does not.)</p>
<p class="bas indent1"><span class="nm">(c)</span><span class="cl">(Beraisa):</span> If one vowed from milk, he is permitted Kum. If he vowed from Kum, he is permitted milk;</p>
<p class="bas indent1"><span class="nm">(d)</span>If one vowed from milk, he is permitted cheese. If he vowed from cheese, he is permitted milk;</p>
<p class="bas indent1"><span class="nm">(e)</span>If one vowed from gravy, he is permitted Kipah. If he vowed from Kipah, he is permitted gravy;</p>
<p class="bas indent2"><span class="nm">1.</span>If he said 'this meat is forbidden to me', he may not even have its gravy or Kipah.</p>
<p class="bas indent1"><span class="nm">(f)</span>If one vowed from wine, he is permitted a Tavshil that has the taste of wine;</p>
<p class="bas indent2"><span class="nm">1.</span>If he said 'this wine is forbidden to me', and it fell into a Tavshil, if it has the taste of wine, it is forbidden.</p>
<p class="bas indent1"><span class="nm">(g)</span><span class="cl">(Mishnah):</span> If one vowed from grapes, he may drink wine. If one vowed from olives, he may have oil;</p>
<p class="bas indent1"><span class="nm">(h)</span>If he said 'I will not taste these grapes or olives', he may not have them, or what comes from them.</p>
<p class="bas indent1"><span class="nm">(i)</span><span class="cl">(Gemara - Rami bar Chama) Question:</span> Why is the law in the Seifa unlike the Reisha?</p>
<p class="bas indent2"><span class="nm">1.</span>Is it because he said 'these'?</p>
<p class="bas indent2"><span class="nm">2.</span>Or, is it because he said 'I will not taste'?</p>
<p class="bas indent3"><span class="nm">i.</span><span class="cl">Question:</span> If it is because he said 'these', why does the Seifa say that he also said 'I will not taste'?</p>
<p class="bas indent3"><span class="nm">ii.</span><span class="cl">Answer:</span> This teaches that even though he said 'I will not taste', he is forbidden in what comes from them only if he said 'these'.</p>
<p class="bas indent1"><span class="nm">(j)</span><span class="cl">Answer #1 (Rava - Mishnah):</span> If one said 'these Peros are forbidden to me, (or) to my mouth' - he is forbidden in Chilufeihem (what they are exchanged for) and Giduleihem (what grows from them).</p>
<p class="bas indent2"><span class="nm">1.</span><span class="cl">Inference:</span> He is permitted what comes out of them.</p>
<p class="bas indent1"><span class="nm">(k)</span><span class="cl">Rejection:</span> No, he is forbidden what comes from them.</p>
<p class="bas indent2"><span class="nm">1.</span>The Mishnah teaches a bigger Chidush, that Chilufeihem is like Giduleihem.</p>
<p class="bas indent1"><span class="nm">(l)</span><span class="cl">Answer #2 (Mishnah):</span> If one said 'I will not eat' or 'I will not taste', he is permitted Chilufeihem and Giduleihem.</p>
<p class="bas indent2"><span class="nm">1.</span><span class="cl">Inference:</span> He is forbidden what comes from them!</p>
<p class="bas indent1"><span class="nm">(m)</span><span class="cl">Rejection:</span> No. The Mishnah discussed only Chilufeihem and Giduleihem, for these were taught in the Reisha.</p>
<p class="bas indent1"><span class="nm">(n)</span><span class="cl">Answer #3 (Mishnah - R. Yehudah):</span> A case occurred in which (I vowed from meat, and) R. Tarfon forbade to me eggs cooked with the meat;</p>
<p class="bas indent2"><span class="nm">1.</span><span class="cl">Chachamim:</span> Yes; but this is only when the vow was from 'this meat';</p>
<p class="bas indent2"><span class="nm">2.</span>(We agree that) if one forbade a food, and it became mixed with other food, if the Isur can be tasted, the mixture is forbidden.</p>
<p class="bas indent1"><span class="nm">(o)</span><span class="cl">Retraction:</span> This was not the question. (Surely, Rami knew the Mishnah, which teaches that "this" suffices to forbid what comes from the food.)</p>
<p class="bas indent2"><span class="nm">1.</span>Rather, he asked whether saying 'I will not eat' or 'I will not taste' also forbids what comes from it (even if he didn't say 'this')?</p>
<p class="bas indent1"><span class="nm">(p)</span><span class="cl">Answer (Mishnah):</span> If one said 'I will not eat fish, fishes', he may not eat big or small fish, whether raw or cooked. He may eat chopped fish and brine.</p>
<p class="bas indent1"><span class="nm">(q)</span><span class="cl">Rejection (Rava):</span> Perhaps the Mishnah discusses when the brine already left the fish before the vow.</p>
