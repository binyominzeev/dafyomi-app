<p class="bas subject"><span class="nm">1)</span>CONDUCT IN A <i>BEIS HA'KENESES</i></p>
<p class="bas indent1"><span class="nm">(a)</span><span class="cl">(Rabah bar Rav Huna):</span> Once the Sefer Torah is opened, one may not talk, even Halachos - "in its opening, all the people stood."</p>
<p class="bas indent2"><span class="nm">1.</span>'Standing' connotes silence.</p>
<p class="bas indent1"><span class="nm">(b)</span><span class="cl">(R. Zeira):</span> We learn from "the ears of the entire nation were (listening) to the Sefer Torah."</p>
<p class="bas indent1"><span class="nm">(c)</span><span class="cl">(R. Yehoshua ben Levi):</span> A Kohen who did not wash his hands may not bless - "lift your hands in Kedushah and bless Hash-m."</p>
<p class="bas indent1"><span class="nm">(d)</span><span class="cl">(R. Elazar ben Shamuah):</span> I merited a long life through the following:</p>
<p class="bas indent2"><span class="nm">1.</span>I never used a Beis ha'Keneses for a shortcut;</p>
<p class="bas indent2"><span class="nm">2.</span>I never appeared to step on the heads of the Talmidim;</p>
<p class="bas indent2"><span class="nm">3.</span>I never gave Birkas Kohanim without a Berachah.</p>
<p class="bas indent1"><span class="nm">(e)</span><span class="cl">Question:</span> What (other) Berachah does a Kohen say?</p>
<p class="bas indent1"><span class="nm">(f)</span><span class="cl">Answer (R. Zeira):</span> He blesses "Who sanctified us with the Kedushah of Aharon, and commanded us to bless His nation Yisrael with love."</p>
<p class="bas indent1"><span class="nm">(g)</span><span class="cl">Question:</span> What does he say when he starts to walk (towards the Duchan, where he will bless)?</p>
<p class="bas indent1"><span class="nm">(h)</span><span class="cl">Answer:</span> He says "may it be Your will, Hash-m, that there should be no stumbling block or sin in this Berachah You commanded us to bless Yisrael.</p>
<p class="bas indent1"><span class="nm">(i)</span><span class="cl">Question:</span> What does he say after turning away from the Tzibur (after Birkas Kohanim)?</p>
<p class="bas indent1"><span class="nm">(j)</span><span class="cl">Answer (Rav Chisda):</span> He says "Master of the world! We did like You decreed upon us. Do with us like You promised - "look down from Your Kodesh dwelling, from Shamayim..."</p>

<p class="bas subject"><span class="nm">2)</span>THE ORDER OF THE BLESSING</p>
<p class="bas indent1"><span class="nm">(a)</span><span class="cl">(Rav Chisda):</span> The Kohanim may not fold their fingers until they face away from the Tzibur (after Birkas Kohanim).</p>
<p class="bas indent1"><span class="nm">(b)</span><span class="cl">(R. Zeira):</span> The Korei (the one who recites the words for the Kohanim to repeat) may not recite until the Tzibur finishes answering Amen (to the Shali'ach Tzibur's Berachah of Modim);</p>
<p class="bas indent2"><span class="nm">1.</span>The Kohanim may not bless until the Korei finishes;</p>
<p class="bas indent2"><span class="nm">2.</span>The Tzibur may not answer Amen (to each Berachah of Birkas Kohanim) until the Kohanim finish the Berachah;</p>
<p class="bas indent2"><span class="nm">3.</span>The Kohanim may not begin the next Berachah until the Tzibur finishes answering Amen from the previous Berachah.</p>
<p class="bas indent1"><span class="nm">(c)</span><span class="cl">(R. Zeira):</span> The Kohanim may not turn away from the Tzibur (after the Berachah) until the Shali'ach Tzibur begins Sim Shalom;</p>
<p class="bas indent2"><span class="nm">1.</span>They may not start returning to their places until the Shali'ach Tzibur finishes Sim Shalom.</p>
<p class="bas subject"><span class="nm">3)</span><i>HALACHOS </i>OF READING THE TORAH</p>
<p class="bas indent1"><span class="nm">(a)</span><span class="cl">(R. Zeira):</span> The Tzibur may not answer Amen until the Korei (one called to read from the Torah) finishes his Berachah;</p>
<p class="bas indent2"><span class="nm">1.</span>The Korei may not begin reading until the Tzibur finishes answering Amen (the custom was that everyone called to the Torah used to read himself);</p>
<p class="bas indent2"><span class="nm">2.</span>The translator (who translates aloud for the Tzibur) may not begin until the Korei finishes the verse.</p>
<p class="bas indent2"><span class="nm">3.</span>The Korei may not read the next verse until the translator finishes the previous verse.</p>
<p class="bas indent1"><span class="nm">(b)</span><span class="cl">(R. Tanchum):</span> The one called to read from Nevi'im (the prophets) must first read from the Torah;</p>
<p class="bas indent2"><span class="nm">1.</span>He may not begin reading from the Navi until the Torah is wrapped.</p>
<p class="bas indent1"><span class="nm">(c)</span><span class="cl">(R. Tanchum):</span> The Shali'ach Tzibur may not bare the Teivah (here this refers to the table on which the Torah was read) from its nice garments while the Tzibur waits, for this is dishonorable to the Tzibur.</p>
<p class="bas indent1"><span class="nm">(d)</span><span class="cl">(R. Tanchum):</span> The Tzibur may not leave until the Torah is taken (and put in its place - it seems that these words should be deleted).</p>
<p class="bas indent1"><span class="nm">(e)</span><span class="cl">(Shmuel):</span> They must wait until it leaves.</p>
<p class="bas indent1"><span class="nm">(f)</span>They do not argue. R. Tanchum discusses when there is more than one exit (one may leave from a different exit before the Sefer Torah leaves). Shmuel discusses when there is only one exit.</p>
<p class="bas indent1"><span class="nm">(g)</span><span class="cl">(Rava):</span> Bar Ahina explained the source of Shmuel's law - "you will go after Hash-m."</p>
<p class="bas subject"><span class="nm">4)</span>VERSES SAID DURING <i>BIRKAS KOHANIM</i></p>
<p class="bas indent1"><span class="nm">(a)</span><span class="cl">(R. Zeira):</span> When the Kohanim bless, the Tzibur says "bless Hash-m, mighty angels..."; "bless Hash-m, all legions that do His will"; "bless Hash-m, all His creations, in all places of His dominion..."</p>
<p class="bas indent1"><span class="nm">(b)</span><span class="cl">(Rav Asi):</span> When Kohanim bless during Musaf on Shabbos, the Tzibur says "Shir ha'Ma'alos; Bless Hash-m, all servants of Hash-m"; "Lift your hands in Kedushah and bless Hash-m"; "Blessed is Hash-m from Tziyon, He dwells in Yerushalayim..."</p>
<p class="bas indent1"><span class="nm">(c)</span><span class="cl">Question:</span> Why don't we say "Hash-m will bless you from Tziyon", which is in the same psalm with the first two verses?</p>
<p class="bas indent1"><span class="nm">(d)</span><span class="cl">Answer (Yehudah, son of R. Shimon ben Pazi):</span> Since the first verses are Berachos to Hash-m, we conclude with a Berachah to Hash-m.</p>
<p class="bas indent1"><span class="nm">(e)</span><span class="cl">(Rav Acha bar Yakov):</span> In Minchah on a fast day, the Tzibur says "if our sins incriminate us, Hash-m, act (mercifully) for the sake of Your name"; "The hope of Yisrael, Who saves them at the time of their distress, why will You be like a stranger in the land?", "Why will You be like a man befuddled and oblivious, like a mighty one who cannot save?"</p>
