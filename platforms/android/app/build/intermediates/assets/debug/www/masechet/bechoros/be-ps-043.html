<p class="bas indent1"><span class="nm">(a)</span><span class="cl">(Mishnah):</span> These Mumim (taught regarding animals) disqualify people (Kohanim from Avodah), whether they are temporary or permanent;</p>
<p class="bas indent1"><span class="nm">(b)</span><span class="cl">The following Mumim apply only to people (they will be explained):</span> Kilon, Liftan, Makvan, his head is slanted, Sekifas.</p>

<p class="bas indent1"><span class="nm">(d)</span>Chachamim are Posel.</p>

<p class="bas indent1"><span class="nm">(f)</span><span class="cl">Question:</span> What is considered bald?</p>

<p class="bas indent1"><span class="nm">(i)</span><span class="cl">Question #2:</span> What is the source that Dak and Tavlul disqualify animals? The Torah writes them only regarding people!</p>
<p class="bas indent1"><span class="nm">(j)</span><span class="cl">Answer:</span> We learn Mumim of people and animals from each other:</p>
<p class="bas indent2"><span class="nm">1.</span><span class="cl">(Beraisa):</span> Yabeles is not written regarding people. Dak and Tavlul are not written regarding animals;</p>

<p class="bas indent2"><span class="nm">3.</span><span class="cl">Answer:</span> We learn from a Gezeirah Shavah, "Garav" and "Yalefes" are written regarding both of them.</p>
<p class="bas indent2"><span class="nm">4.</span>We must say that this is Mufneh (the words are superfluous, they are written only for the Gezeirah Shavah). If not, we could challenge it!</p>
<p class="bas indent3"><span class="nm">i.</span>We cannot learn man from animals, for animals are themselves offered on the Mizbe'ach. (Perhaps the Torah is more particular about their Mumim);</p>

<p class="bas indent2"><span class="nm">5.</span><span class="cl">Question:</span> Which of the words are Mufneh?</p>
<p class="bas indent2"><span class="nm">6.</span><span class="cl">Answer:</span> The Torah could have written only "Yalefes," and we would know that all the more so "Garav" is a Mum, for it is more repulsive. (Rashi - it is dry, and it makes cracks; R. Gershom - it is moist and runny);</p>
<p class="bas indent3"><span class="nm">i.</span>"Garav" was written solely to make the verse Mufneh for the Gezeirah Shavah.</p>
<p class="bas indent1"><span class="nm">(k)</span><span class="cl">Question:</span> (Why are some Mumim mentioned regarding people <i>and</i> animals?) The Torah could have listed all Mumim regarding one of them, and repeated "Garav" and "Yalefes" regarding the other for the Gezeirah Shavah!</p>
<p class="bas indent1"><span class="nm">(l)</span><span class="cl">Answer:</span> Had it listed the Mumim regarding people (and only Garav and Yalefes regarding animals), we would have thought that only these two disqualify animals, but Mumim that do not apply to people, such as uncloven feet or Mumim of the Chutim (gums, or teeth), do not apply to animals;</p>
<p class="bas indent2"><span class="nm">1.</span>Had it listed the Mumim regarding animals (and only Garav and Yalefes regarding people), we would have thought that only these two disqualify people, but Mumim that do not apply to animals, such as Giben (his eyebrows are too long) and Charum (the nose is sunken between the eyes), do not apply to people.</p>
<p class="bas indent1"><span class="nm">(m)</span><span class="cl">Question:</span> The Torah could have listed all Mumim regarding one of them, and regarding the other, only those not mentioned in the first!</p>

<p class="bas indent1"><span class="nm">(n)</span><span class="cl">Answer:</span> Even though the Torah did not need to write the Mumim common to both in both places, this is not a problem;</p>

<p class="bas indent2"><span class="nm">1.</span><span class="cl">Answer:</span> We cannot learn (Mumim of) Bechor or Kodshim from (those of) man, for the Torah gave many Mitzvos to people;</p>
