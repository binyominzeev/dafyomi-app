<p class=newsubafdaf><span class=numt>1)</span> IMMERSING IN THE <i>MIKDASH</i> AT NIGHT</p>
<p class=firstindent><span class=numl1>(a)</span><span class=desl1>	(Continuation of Mishnah):</span> If one of the Kohanim saw Keri (had a seminal emission, making him Tamei), he would go through tunnels to the Mikveh; there were lamps illuminating the tunnels.</p>
<p class=firstindent><span class=numl1>(b)</span>	There was a big fire near the Mikveh, and a bathroom of honor;</p>
<p class=secondindent><span class=numl2>1.</span>	If someone was inside, it was locked. If it was empty, it was open.</p>
<p class=firstindent><span class=numl1>(c)</span>	He would immerse, dry himself and warm himself by the fire. He would return to the other Kohanim until the gates were opened in the morning, and then he would leave.</p>
<p class=firstindent><span class=numl1>(d)</span>	Whoever wanted to (be in the lottery to) do the Terumas ha'Deshen (taking the ashes off the Mizbe'ach) would rise early and immerse before the appointee (over the lottery) came;</p>
<p class=secondindent><span class=numl2>1.</span>	The appointee did not come at a fixed time. It could be a little before or after Keros ha'Gever (when a certain man would yell to wake the Kohanim, shortly before dawn. Alternatively, it is when roosters crow. This was a third of the night after midnight (Mefaresh. Leket Yosher 1:148b says that the Mefaresh is the Rashbam. A Hagahah there derives from Tosfos Yoma 16b DH Min that the Mefaresh is Ri bar Baruch).)</p>
<p class=firstindent><span class=numl1>(e)</span>	The appointee would knock on the gates, and they would open them. He would say "Whoever immersed may participate in the lottery";</p>
<p class=secondindent><span class=numl2>1.</span>	He conducted the lottery, and someone won.</p>
<p class=newsubject><span class=numt>2)</span> THE SOURCE THAT KOHANIM GUARD</p>
<p class=firstindent><span class=numl1>(a)</span>	(Gemara) Question: What is the source (that Kohanim must guard in the Mikdash)?</p>
<p class=firstindent><span class=numl1>(b)</span><span class=desl1>	Answer (Abaye):</span> "Veha'Chonim Lifnei ha'Mishkan Kedmah Lifnei Ohel Mo'ed Moshe v'Aharon u'Vanav Shomrim Mishmeres ha'Mikdash l'Mishmeres Bnei Yisrael."</p>
<p class=firstindent><span class=numl1>(c)</span>	Clarification of question: A Mishnah (in Midos) teaches that Kohanim guarded in three places (by themselves), and Leviyim in 21 places. The verse puts the Kohanim and Leviyim (Moshe) together!</p>
<p class=firstindent><span class=numl1>(d)</span>	Answer: (There is a break in the verse. It says) "veha'Chonim Lifnei ha'Mishkan... Moshe), and (separately) "v'Aharon u'Vanav Shomrim... ";</p>
<p class=secondindent><span class=numl2>1.</span>	Aharon was in one place, and his sons were in two other places.</p>
<p class=firstindent><span class=numl1>(e)</span>	Question: How do we know to break up the verse like this? Perhaps they (Leviyim and Kohanim) guarded together!</p>
<p class=firstindent><span class=numl1>(f)</span>	Answer: The verse changes from "Chonim" to "Shomrim" to teach that they are separate.</p>
<p class=firstindent><span class=numl1>(g)</span>	Question: Perhaps all Kohanim guarded together!</p>
<p class=firstindent><span class=numl1>(h)</span>	Answer #1: The verse equates Moshe and the Kohanim. Just like Moshe guarded by himself, also Aharon u'Vanav.</p>
<p class=firstindent><span class=numl1>(i)</span><span class=desl1>	Answer #2 (Rav Ashi):</span> "Shomrim Mishmeres (ha'Mikdash) l'Mishmeres" connotes three places.</p>
<p class=bbbline>26b----------------------------------------26b</p>
<p class=firstindent><span class=numl1>(j)</span>	Question: Were the "Aliyos" of Beis Avtinas and Beis ha'Nitzutz truly upper stories, or merely tall, like Aliyos (Rosh - built on top of mounds)?</p>
<p class=firstindent><span class=numl1>(k)</span><span class=desl1>	Answer (Mishnah):</span> In the north, Beis ha'Nitzotz was like an Achsadra (a room open on one side), and an Aliyah was built on top of it;</p>
<p class=secondindent><span class=numl2>1.</span>	Kohanim guarded from above, and Leviyim guarded below. It had an opening to Chol (a place without Kedushas Mikdash).</p>
<p class=firstindent><span class=numl1>(l)</span>	Question: What is the source that Kohanim guard above and Leviyim below?</p>
<p class=firstindent><span class=numl1>(m)</span><span class=desl1>	Answer (Beraisa):</span> "V'Yilavu Alecha vi'Sharasucha" -- they (the Leviyim) will accompany (and be subordinate to) you (Kohanim) -- in your Avodah.</p>
<p class=firstindent><span class=numl1>(n)</span>	Version #1 (Rosh) Question: Perhaps they will do their Avodah (guard the places incumbent on them), and you will guard other places!</p>
<p class=firstindent><span class=numl1>(o)</span>	Version #2 (Mefaresh) Question: Perhaps they will do their Avodah (sing and carry the Mishkan in the desert), and you will do the Avodah of the Mizbe'ach!</p>
<p class=firstindent><span class=numl1>(p)</span>	Answer: "V'Nilvu Alecha v'Shomru Es Mishmeres Ohel Mo'ed l'Chol Avodas ha'Ohel" refers to their Avodah. Therefore, "v'Yilavu Alecha vi'Sharasucha" teaches that they will assist (and be subordinate) in your Avodah;</p>
<p class=secondindent><span class=numl2>1.</span>	The Kohanim guard above, and the Leviyim below.</p>
<p class=firstindent><span class=numl1>(q)</span><span class=desl1>	(Mishnah):</span> Beis ha'Moked was a dome. It was a big house.</p>
<p class=firstindent><span class=numl1>(r)</span>	Question: Was there was one guarding there?!</p>
<p class=secondindent><span class=numl2>1.</span><span class=desl2>	Contradiction (Beraisa):</span> There were two gates in Beis ha'Moked. One was open to the Cheil (the area surrounding the Azarah and Ezras Nashim), and the other was open to the Azarah;</p>
<p class=secondindent><span class=numl2>2.</span>	R. Yehudah says, the gate to the Azarah was only a small opening from which they would enter to check if all the Kelim were there (R. Gershom; Rosh - to check if any of the Shomrim were sleeping. Mefaresh - they would wash the Azarah from there.)</p>
<p class=firstindent><span class=numl1>(s)</span><span class=desl1>	Answer (Abaye):</span> Since the gates were near each other, one person could guard both. He could see them at the same time.</p>
<p class=newsubject><span class=numt>3)</span> WHERE THE KOHANIM SLEPT</p>
<p class=firstindent><span class=numl1>(a)</span><span class=desl1>	(Mishnah):</span> Stone "Rovdim" jutted out all around.</p>
<p class=firstindent><span class=numl1>(b)</span>	Question: What are Rovdim?</p>
<p class=firstindent><span class=numl1>(c)</span>	Answer: They are ledges sticking out. One could climb from one ledge to the next.</p>
<p class=firstindent><span class=numl1>(d)</span>	Question: We cannot cut stones to make ledges -- "veha'Bayis b'Hibanoso Even Shelemah"!</p>
<p class=firstindent><span class=numl1>(e)</span><span class=desl1>	Answer (Abaye):</span> They would cut the stones to the accurate sizes (to make ledges) outside the Azarah (it is permitted to cut there) -- "Avnei Eser Amos v'Avnei Shemoneh Amos."</p>
<p class=firstindent><span class=numl1>(f)</span><span class=desl1>	(Mishnah):</span> The elders of the Beis Av would sleep there...</p>
<p class=firstindent><span class=numl1>(g)</span>	Question: Why didn't they bring beds there?</p>
<p class=firstindent><span class=numl1>(h)</span><span class=desl1>	Answer (Abaye):</span> It is not proper to bring beds into the Mikdash.</p>
<p class=firstindent><span class=numl1>(i)</span><span class=desl1>	(Mishnah):</span> Pirchei (young) Kohanim would sleep on the floor. Each left his garment on the floor.</p>
<p class=firstindent><span class=numl1>(j)</span>	Question: Why are they called Rovim above, and here Pirchei Kohanim?</p>
<p class=firstindent><span class=numl1>(k)</span>	Answer: "Rovim" refers to minors. They may not do Avodah;</p>
<p class=secondindent><span class=numl2>1.</span>	"Pirchei Kehunah" refers to young adults. They may do Avodah. (Rosh - they would sleep at night in order to have strength for the Avodah the next day.)</p>
