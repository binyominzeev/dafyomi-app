<p class="bas subject"><span class="nm">1)</span>A THIEF WHO LATER BOUGHT THE FIELD (cont.)</p>
<p class="bas indent1"><span class="nm">(a)</span><span class="cl">Question:</span> What is the difference between the answers?</p>
<p class="bas indent1"><span class="nm">(b)</span><span class="cl">Answer #1:</span> The buyer died.</p>
<p class="bas indent2"><span class="nm">1.</span>There is no concern of being called a thief, but (Rav Ashi would say) that he wants to conduct his dealings faithfully with the heirs.</p>
<p class="bas indent1"><span class="nm">(c)</span><span class="cl">Rejection:</span> If he does not justify himself, the heirs will call him a thief!</p>
<p class="bas indent1"><span class="nm">(d)</span><span class="cl">Answer #2:</span> The thief died.</p>
<p class="bas indent2"><span class="nm">1.</span>He is not concerned about being called a thief after his death, but he wants that his dealings were faithful.</p>
<p class="bas indent1"><span class="nm">(e)</span><span class="cl">Rejection:</span> He does not want that people will call his children 'children of a thief'!</p>
<p class="bas indent1"><span class="nm">(f)</span><span class="cl">Answer #3:</span> He never sold the stolen field, rather, he gave it for a gift.</p>
<p class="bas indent2"><span class="nm">1.</span>There is no concern of being called a thief, but he wants to conduct his dealings faithfully</p>
<p class="bas indent1"><span class="nm">(g)</span>(The following apply when Reuven stole Levi's field and sold it to Shimon.)</p>
<p class="bas indent2"><span class="nm">1.</span>Obviously, if Reuven sold or gave it to Yehudah and then bought it from Levi, he did not buy it so Shimon should keep it (therefore, Shimon gets his money back, but not the land);</p>
<p class="bas indent2"><span class="nm">2.</span>If Reuven inherited it, he did not do anything to show that he wants Shimon to keep it.</p>
<p class="bas indent2"><span class="nm">3.</span>If Reuven collected the field for a debt that Levi owed to him:</p>
<p class="bas indent3"><span class="nm">i.</span>If Levi had other fields and Reuven requested specifically this one, this shows that he wanted Shimon to keep it;</p>
<p class="bas indent3"><span class="nm">ii.</span>If this was Levi's only field, we have no such indication.</p>
<p class="bas indent1"><span class="nm">(h)</span><span class="cl">(Rav Acha or Ravina):</span> If Levi gave it to Reuven for a gift, this is like an inheritance (Reuven did nothing);</p>
<p class="bas indent1"><span class="nm">(i)</span><span class="cl">(The other of Rav Acha and Ravina):</span> If Levi gave it to Reuven like a gift, we assume that he requested this (to cause that his dealings were faithful).</p>
<p class="bas indent1"><span class="nm">(j)</span><span class="cl">Question:</span> Until how long do we assume that Reuven acted in order to conduct his dealings faithfully?</p>
<p class="bas indent1"><span class="nm">(k)</span><span class="cl">Answer #1 (Rav Huna):</span> It is until Shimon brings him to trial.</p>
<p class="bas indent1"><span class="nm">(l)</span><span class="cl">Answer #2 (Chiya bar Rav):</span> It is until Shimon receives an Adrachta (a document authorizing him to collect from Reuven's property).</p>
<p class="bas indent1"><span class="nm">(m)</span><span class="cl">Answer #3 (Rav Papa):</span> It is until the days of announcing (that Beis Din is selling Reuven's property).</p>
<p class="bas subject"><span class="nm">2)</span>HOW DOES THE BUYER ACQUIRE?</p>
<p class="bas indent1"><span class="nm">(a)</span><span class="cl">Question (Rami bar Chama):</span> (When we say that Reuven bought it for Shimon to keep), how did Shimon acquire the field?</p>
<p class="bas indent2"><span class="nm">1.</span>The document that he received is worthless (Reuven did not own it at the time)!</p>
<p class="bas indent1"><span class="nm">(b)</span><span class="cl">Answer (Rava):</span> The case is, Shimon trusted Reuven to give him the field. With the pleasure that Shimon relies on him, Reuven transfers the field.</p>
<p class="bas indent1"><span class="nm">(c)</span><span class="cl">Question (Rav Sheshes - Beraisa):</span> If Levi sold to Yehudah 'what I will inherit from my father' or 'what will be caught in my trap', this is void;</p>
<p class="bas indent2"><span class="nm">1.</span>If he said 'what I will inherit from my father today' or 'what will be caught in my trap today', it is valid.</p>
<p class="bas indent2"><span class="nm">2.</span>We learn that one cannot sell something that is not yet in his possession</p>
<p class="bas indent1"><span class="nm">(d)</span><span class="cl">Answer (Rava):</span> One who bought a stolen field relied on the seller. He has Gemiras Da'as (the resolve needed for an acquisition). One who buys a future  inheritance is not confident of receiving anything.</p>
<p class="bas indent2"><span class="nm">1.</span>One who bought a stolen field trusts that the seller will get the field for him, so he will not be called a thief. This does not apply by inheritance.</p>
<p class="bas indent1"><span class="nm">(e)</span><span class="cl">Version #1 (Rashi) R. Aba bar Zavda:</span> This question is too difficult. There is no answer for it.</p>
<p class="bas indent1"><span class="nm">(f)</span><span class="cl">Rava:</span> We can answer it (like above).</p>
<p class="bas indent1"><span class="nm">(g)</span><span class="cl">Version #2 (Ge'onim) R. Aba bar Zavda:</span> This is a simple question.</p>
<p class="bas indent1"><span class="nm">(h)</span><span class="cl">Rava:</span> It is very difficult!</p>
<p class="bas indent2"><span class="nm">1.</span>Regarding the stolen field, the buyer relied on the seller, by inheritance, he lacks resolve. (end of Version #2)</p>
<p class="bas indent1"><span class="nm">(i)</span>A case occurred in Pumbedisa. Rav Yosef said like R. Aba bar Zavda, Abaye said like Rava.</p>
<p class="bas indent1"><span class="nm">(j)</span><span class="cl">Question:</span> In the Beraisa, why is it different when he says (what I will inherit or my trap will catch) 'today'?</p>
<p class="bas indent1"><span class="nm">(k)</span><span class="cl">Answer (R. Yochanan):</span> The case when he says 'today' is that his father is about to die. (Chachamim enacted that) he can sell his inheritance in order to be able to honor his father with a proper burial;</p>
<p class="bas indent2"><span class="nm">1.</span>Regarding the trap, Chachamim enacted than the sale is valid to help the trapper support himself.</p>
<p class="bas bbbline">16b----------------------------------------16b</p>
<p class="bas indent1"><span class="nm">(l)</span><span class="cl">(Rav Huna citing Rav):</span> If Reuven told Shimon 'the field I will buy, when I buy it, it is acquired to you from now', Shimon acquires it.</p>
<p class="bas indent1"><span class="nm">(m)</span><span class="cl">Rava:</span> Presumably, this is when Reuven did not specify a particular field. If he did, Shimon would lack resolve, lest the seller will not want to sell it;</p>
<p class="bas indent2"><span class="nm">1.</span>However, I swear that Rav said so even regarding a particular field!</p>
<p class="bas indent2"><span class="nm">2.</span>Rav rules like R. Meir, who says that one can acquire something that is not yet in the world.</p>
<p class="bas indent3"><span class="nm">i.</span><span class="cl">(Beraisa):</span> If Levi told Leah that she will be Mekudeshes to him (when this will be possible, i.e.): after he or she converts, or after he or she is freed, or after her sister (if Levi is married to her sister) or husband will die, or after Leah does Chalitzah, she is not Mekudeshes (even after the event occurs);</p>
<p class="bas indent3"><span class="nm">ii.</span>R. Meir says, she is Mekudeshes (after it occurs).</p>
<p class="bas indent2"><span class="nm">3.</span>(Some cases of) a woman are like a field (e.g. her husband's death is beyond their control), yet R. Meir says that it takes effect!</p>
<p class="bas subject"><span class="nm">3)</span>ONE WHO FINDS A DOCUMENT</p>
<p class="bas indent1"><span class="nm">(a)</span><span class="cl">(Shmuel):</span> If one finds a Hakna'ah document (that Shimon owes Reuven), he returns it to Reuven.</p>
<p class="bas indent2"><span class="nm">1.</span>We are not concerned lest the loan was never given. Shimon obligated himself in any case!</p>
<p class="bas indent2"><span class="nm">2.</span>We are not concerned that it was paid, for then Shimon would have torn it up.</p>
<p class="bas indent1"><span class="nm">(b)</span><span class="cl">Rav Nachman:</span> My father was a scribe in Shmuel's Beis Din. From my youth, I recall announcements that Hakna'ah documents found in the market should be returned to the lender.</p>
<p class="bas indent1"><span class="nm">(c)</span><span class="cl">Support (Rav Anan - Mishnah):</span> All documents of actions of Beis Din should be returned.</p>
<p class="bas indent2"><span class="nm">1.</span>This shows that we are not concerned lest they were paid.</p>
<p class="bas indent1"><span class="nm">(d)</span><span class="cl">Rejection #1 (R. Zeira):</span> The Mishnah discusses Chaltasa documents (saying that a lender collected a field as payment), or Adrachta. Payment does not apply to such documents.</p>
<p class="bas indent1"><span class="nm">(e)</span><span class="cl">Objection (Rava):</span> Payment applies to them!</p>
<p class="bas indent2"><span class="nm">1.</span><span class="cl">(Chachamim of Neharda'a):</span> If Beis Din allowed a lender to collect a field for payment, the borrower can recover his field if he pays the debt within one year.</p>
<p class="bas indent2"><span class="nm">2.</span><span class="cl">(Ameimar):</span> I am from Neharda'a. I hold that he can always redeem his field!</p>
<p class="bas indent1"><span class="nm">(f)</span><span class="cl">Rejection #2 (Rava):</span> For such documents, we are not concerned for payment. If the borrower later paid, he caused his own loss by not tearing the document, or demanding a document of (re)sale of his field from the lender.</p>
<p class="bas indent2"><span class="nm">1.</span>Letter of the law, the lender need not return the field. Chachamim obligated him to return it due to "you will do what is straight and good in the eyes of Hash-m";</p>
<p class="bas indent3"><span class="nm">i.</span>This is like a new sale, so a new document should be written.</p>
<p class="bas indent2"><span class="nm">2.</span>Regarding loan documents, perhaps the borrower is not at fault;</p>
<p class="bas indent3"><span class="nm">i.</span>Perhaps the lender promised to return the document at his next opportunity, or was holding it until the borrower paid the scribe's fee!</p>
<p class="bas indent1"><span class="nm">(g)</span><span class="cl">(R. Avahu):</span> If one finds a loan document, even though it has a Henpek, he may not return it.</p>
<p class="bas indent2"><span class="nm">1.</span>If it has no Henpek, we are concerned lest the loan was never given. Even if it has a Henpek, we are concerned lest it was paid.</p>
<p class="bas indent2"><span class="nm">2.</span><span class="cl">Question:</span> What is a document with a Henpek?</p>
<p class="bas indent2"><span class="nm">3.</span><span class="cl">Answer:</span> It was validated by Beis Din.</p>
<p class="bas indent1"><span class="nm">(h)</span><span class="cl">Question (R. Yirmiyah - Mishnah):</span> All documents of actions of Beis Din should be returned.</p>
<p class="bas indent1"><span class="nm">(i)</span><span class="cl">Answer #1 (R. Avahu):</span> That does not apply to all actions of Beis Din. It is only when the borrower was established to be a liar (then he is not believed to say that he paid).</p>
<p class="bas indent1"><span class="nm">(j)</span><span class="cl">Objection (Rava):</span> If a man was once established to be a liar, will he never pay?!</p>
<p class="bas indent1"><span class="nm">(k)</span><span class="cl">Answer #2 (Rava):</span> The Mishnah discusses documents of Chaltasa or Adrachta (like R. Zeira said above).</p>
