<p class="dedicationbox">SHEVUOS 40 - Two weeks of study material have been dedicated by Mrs. Estanne Abraham Fawer to honor the Yahrzeit of her father, Rav Mordechai ben Eliezer Zvi (Rabbi Morton Weiner) Z'L, who passed away on 18 Teves 5760. May the merit of supporting and advancing Dafyomi study -- which was so important to him -- during the weeks of his Yahrzeit serve as an Iluy for his Neshamah. </p>

<p class="bas subject"><span class="nm">1)</span>THE ADMISSION AND DENIAL</p>
<p class="bas indent1"><span class="nm">(a)</span><span class="cl">Support (Mishnah):</span> If Reuven claimed a gold Dinar, and Shimon admitted that he owes a silver Dinar, Trisis, Pundyon or Perutah, Shimon must (pay it and) swear, for all coins are considered to be the same Min.</p>
<p class="bas indent2"><span class="nm">1.</span>We understand why he must swear if the claim was the value of a gold Dinar, for the admission was like the claim;</p>
<p class="bas indent2"><span class="nm">2.</span>However, if the claim was a gold Dinar, the admission was unlike the claim. He should be exempt!</p>
<p class="bas indent1"><span class="nm">(b)</span><span class="cl">Rejection (R. Elazar):</span> The case is, he claimed a minted gold Dinar (Rashi; Tosfos - Reuven claimed that he gave to Shimon a gold Dinar to change into smaller coins, and did not receive them). He is liable because all coins are considered the same Min.</p>
<p class="bas indent2"><span class="nm">1.</span><span class="cl">Support (Mishnah):</span> All coins are considered to be the same Min.</p>
<p class="bas indent2"><span class="nm">2.</span>Rav explains, this means that all the coins listed (i.e. even a Perutah) have the same law (each is sufficient admission to obligate an oath).</p>
<p class="bas indent1"><span class="nm">(c)</span><span class="cl">Suggestion:</span> Since R. Elazar learns the Seifa like Shmuel (specific coinage, and not just the value), he also learns the Reisha (two Ma'os) like Shmuel!</p>
<p class="bas indent1"><span class="nm">(d)</span><span class="cl">Rejection:</span> No. He learns the Seifa like Shmuel, but he could learn the Reisha like Rav (the value) or like Shmuel.</p>
<p class="bas indent1"><span class="nm">(e)</span><span class="cl">Question (against Shmuel - Beraisa):</span> If Reuven claimed a gold Dinar <i>of gold</i>, and Shimon admitted that he owes a silver Dinar, he is liable (our text, Rashi; Tosfos - he is exempt).</p>
<p class="bas indent2"><span class="nm">1.</span><span class="cl">Inference:</span> We say that he claimed a coin due to the redundancy. Had he said only 'gold Dinar', we would say that he claims its value!</p>
<p class="bas indent1"><span class="nm">(f)</span><span class="cl">Answer:</span> No, the Beraisa teaches that claiming a gold Dinar is like claiming a gold Dinar of gold, i.e. he claims a coin.</p>
<p class="bas indent1"><span class="nm">(g)</span><span class="cl">Support (for Rav - R. Chiya - Beraisa):</span> If Reuven claimed a Dinar from Shimon, and he admitted to a Dinar less two Ma'os, he must swear (because he denies two Ma'os);</p>
<p class="bas indent2"><span class="nm">1.</span>If he admitted to a Dinar less one Ma'ah, he is exempt (because he denies less than two Ma'os).</p>
<p class="bas indent1"><span class="nm">(h)</span><span class="cl">(Rav Nachman bar Yitzchak citing Shmuel):</span> The minimal claim of two Ma'os only applies to the oath of partial admission. If Reuven claims even a Perutah and one witness supports him, Shimon must swear.</p>
<p class="bas indent1"><span class="nm">(i)</span><span class="cl">Question:</span> What is the reason?</p>
<p class="bas indent1"><span class="nm">(j)</span><span class="cl">Answer:</span> "Lo Yakum Ed Echad b'Ish l'Chol Avon ul'Chol Chatas" - one witness does not obligate payment, but he obligates swearing;</p>
<p class="bas indent2"><span class="nm">1.</span><span class="cl">(Beraisa):</span> Whenever two witnesses obligate payment, one witness obligates swearing.</p>
<p class="bas subject"><span class="nm">2)</span>ADMISSION TO A DIFFERENT MIN THAN WAS DENIED</p>
<p class="bas indent1"><span class="nm">(a)</span><span class="cl">(Rav Nachman citing Shmuel):</span> If Reuven claimed wheat and barley, and Shimon admitted that he owes barley, Shimon must swear.</p>
<p class="bas indent1"><span class="nm">(b)</span><span class="cl">R. Yitzchak:</span> Correct! Also R. Yochanan taught like this.</p>
<p class="bas indent2"><span class="nm">1.</span><span class="cl">Inference:</span> This implies that Reish Lakish (who often argues with R. Yochanan) disagrees!</p>
<p class="bas indent2"><span class="nm">2.</span><span class="cl">Rejection:</span> This cannot be inferred, for R. Yitzchak left before Reish Lakish had a chance to argue.</p>
<p class="bas indent3"><span class="nm">i.</span><span class="cl">Version #1:</span> Reish Lakish never disagrees with R. Yochanan until R. Yochanan finishes speaking.</p>
<p class="bas indent3"><span class="nm">ii.</span><span class="cl">Version #2:</span> Reish Lakish was drinking when R. Yochanan said this law.</p>
<p class="bas indent1"><span class="nm">(c)</span><span class="cl">Support (Mishnah):</span> If Reuven claimed wheat, and Shimon admitted that he owes barley, Shimon is exempt. Raban Gamliel obligates.</p>
<p class="bas indent2"><span class="nm">1.</span><span class="cl">Inference:</span> Chachamim exempt because the admission was unlike (any part of) the claim, but if Reuven claimed wheat and barley, and Shimon admitted that he owes barley, Shimon must swear.</p>
<p class="bas indent1"><span class="nm">(d)</span><span class="cl">Rejection:</span> No, Chachamim exempt even in that case;</p>
<p class="bas indent2"><span class="nm">1.</span>The Mishnah discusses one who claimed only wheat, to teach that Raban Gamliel obligates even in this case.</p>
<p class="bas indent1"><span class="nm">(e)</span><span class="cl">Support (Mishnah):</span> If Reuven claimed Kelim and land, and Shimon admitted to (all) the land but denied the Kelim, or admitted to (all) the Kelim but denied the land, he is exempt; (because an admission to land cannot obligate an oath, and we do not make a primary oath about land);</p>
<p class="bas bbbline">40b----------------------------------------40b</p>
<p class="bas indent2"><span class="nm">1.</span>If Shimon admitted to part of the land but denied (all) the Kelim, he is exempt (we do not make a primary oath about land);</p>

<p class="bas indent2"><span class="nm">3.</span><span class="cl">Inference:</span> When he admitted to all the Kelim but denied all the land, he is exempt because we do not swear about land. In a corresponding claim of two kinds of Kelim, if he admitted to one kind, he would be liable!</p>

<p class="bas indent2"><span class="nm">1.</span><span class="cl">(Mishnah):</span> When one must swear about Metaltelim, the claimant can also force him to swear about land (through Gilgul).</p>
<p class="bas indent1"><span class="nm">(h)</span><span class="cl">Answer:</span> Primarily, this law is taught in our Mishnah. There, it is taught along with other laws of land.</p>

<p class="bas indent1"><span class="nm">(a)</span><span class="cl">Question (R. Aba bar Mamal - Beraisa):</span> If Reuven claimed an ox and Shimon admitted that he owes a Seh (or vice-versa), Shimon is exempt. If he claimed an ox and Seh and Shimon admitted to one of them, he must swear.</p>
<p class="bas indent1"><span class="nm">(b)</span><span class="cl">Answer #1 (R. Chiya bar Aba):</span> The Beraisa is like Raban Gamliel.</p>
<p class="bas indent1"><span class="nm">(c)</span><span class="cl">Rejection:</span> Raban Gamliel obligates even in the Reisha (Reuven claimed an ox, and Shimon admitted to a Seh)!</p>
<p class="bas indent1"><span class="nm">(d)</span><span class="cl">Answer #2 (R. Chiya bar Aba):</span> The Beraisa is Admon (38b, who obligates swearing for a claim of barrels of oil and an admission of empty barrels).</p>
<p class="bas indent2"><span class="nm">1.</span><span class="cl">R. Chiya:</span> This is not a flimsy defense, to say that <i>perhaps</i> the Beraisa is Admon. R. Yochanan explicitly said this!</p>
<p class="bas indent1"><span class="nm">(e)</span><span class="cl">(Rav Anan citing Shmuel):</span> If Reuven claimed wheat, and Shimon admitted that he owes barley, if he rushed to admit because he sensed that Reuven was about to claim barley as well, Shimon must swear. If not, he is exempt.</p>
<p class="bas indent1"><span class="nm">(f)</span><span class="cl">(Rav Anan citing Shmuel):</span> If Reuven claimed two needles, and Shimon admitted to one of them, he is liable;</p>
<p class="bas indent2"><span class="nm">1.</span>The Torah specified "Kelim" to teach that one is liable for a claim of any two Kelim (Tosfos - as long as each is worth a Perutah; Rambam - even if they are not worth a Perutah).</p>
<p class="bas indent1"><span class="nm">(g)</span><span class="cl">(Rav Papa):</span> If Reuven claimed Kelim and a Perutah, and Shimon admitted to the Kelim and denied the Perutah, he need not swear;</p>
<p class="bas indent2"><span class="nm">1.</span>If he admitted to the Perutah and denied the Kelim, he must swear.</p>
<p class="bas indent1"><span class="nm">(h)</span>Rav Papa holds like Rav in one respect, and like Shmuel in another.</p>
<p class="bas indent2"><span class="nm">1.</span>He holds like Rav regarding the denial (it must be two Ma'os (or two Kelim)). He holds like Shmuel regarding a claim of wheat and barley, and an admission of barley (he must swear).</p>
<p class="bas subject"><span class="nm">4)</span>THE OATH OF HESES</p>
<p class="bas indent1"><span class="nm">(a)</span><span class="cl">Version #1 (Mishnah):</span> If Reuven claimed a Maneh, and Shimon denied owing anything, he is exempt.</p>
<p class="bas indent1"><span class="nm">(b)</span><span class="cl">(Rav Nachman):</span> Shimon must swear a (Rabbinical) oath called Heses.</p>
<p class="bas indent1"><span class="nm">(c)</span><span class="cl">Question:</span> What is the reason?</p>
<p class="bas indent1"><span class="nm">(d)</span><span class="cl">Answer:</span> There is a Chazakah (i.e. human nature) that Reuven would not claim if Shimon did not owe him.</p>
<p class="bas indent1"><span class="nm">(e)</span><span class="cl">Objection:</span> Just the contrary. There is a Chazakah that one is not so brazen to deny owing his creditor!</p>
<p class="bas indent1"><span class="nm">(f)</span><span class="cl">Answer:</span> Shimon intends to pay. He just wants to evade Reuven until he can pay.</p>
<p class="bas indent2"><span class="nm">1.</span><span class="cl">(Rav Idi bar Avin):</span> One who denies a loan (and is contradicted by witnesses) is not disqualified from testifying (we assume that he intended to pay when he is able);</p>
<p class="bas indent2"><span class="nm">2.</span>One who denies a deposit (and witnesses testify that he did have it) is disqualified from testifying (surely, he intended to steal it).</p>
<p class="bas indent1"><span class="nm">(g)</span><span class="cl">Version #2 (Rav Chaviva) (Mishnah):</span> If Reuven claimed a Maneh from Shimon in front of witnesses, and Shimon admitted that he owes it, and the next day, Reuven claimed it again, if Shimon answers 'I paid you', he is exempt.</p>
<p class="bas indent1"><span class="nm">(h)</span><span class="cl">(Rav Nachman):</span> Shimon must swear Heses.</p>
<p class="bas indent2"><span class="nm">1.</span>According to Version #1, surely Heses applies also to the case of Version #2.</p>
<p class="bas indent2"><span class="nm">2.</span>According to Version #2, Heses only applies in the case of Version #2, when there are grounds to believe the claim, but not in the case of Version #1.</p>
