<p class="bas subject"><span class="nm">1)</span>ONE WHO DID NOT BLESS BEFORE EATING</p>
<p class="bas indent1"><span class="nm">(a)</span><span class="cl">Question:</span> If someone ate and drank without blessing [beforehand], should he bless [now, before eating more]?</p>
<p class="bas indent1"><span class="nm">(b)</span><span class="cl">Answer (Rav Chisda):</span> If one ate garlic, causing him to give off an offensive odor, should he eat more garlic, to increase the odor?! (One who transgressed should not transgress more!)</p>
<p class="bas indent1"><span class="nm">(c)</span><span class="cl">(Ravina):</span> Therefore (since he may bless in the middle), even if he finished his meal, he should bless:</p>
<p class="bas indent2"><span class="nm">1.</span><span class="cl">(Beraisa):</span> After immersion (Tosfos - of a convert; Rashi - of a Ba'al Keri), he blesses, "... Asher Kidshanu b'Mitzvosav v'Tzivanu Al ha'Tevilah."</p>
<p class="bas indent1"><span class="nm">(d)</span><span class="cl">Rejection:</span> That is not a proof -- there, he could not bless before immersing;</p>
<p class="bas indent2"><span class="nm">1.</span>Here, he could have blessed -- since he did not, perhaps he is disqualified from blessing afterwards!</p>
<p class="bas subject"><span class="nm">2)</span>ISPARGUS</p>
<p class="bas indent1"><span class="nm">(a)</span><span class="cl">(Beraisa #1):</span> Ispargus (cabbage soaked in wine) is good for the heart and eyes, all the more so for the intestines;</p>
<p class="bas indent2"><span class="nm">1.</span>If one regularly eats it, it is good for the whole body.</p>
<p class="bas indent2"><span class="nm">2.</span>If one gets drunk from it, it is bad for the whole body.</p>
<p class="bas indent1"><span class="nm">(b)</span><span class="cl">Question:</span> Since it says that it is good for the heart, this implies that it discusses Ispargus soaked in wine -- but if so, it is not good for the intestines!</p>
<p class="bas indent2"><span class="nm">1.</span><span class="cl">(Beraisa #2):</span> Ispargus is good for LA'aT (an acronym for Lev, Einayim, Techul, i.e. heart, eyes, spleen) and bad for RaMaT (Rosh, Me'ayim, Tachtoniyos, i.e. head, intestines, hemorrhoids)!</p>
<p class="bas indent1"><span class="nm">(c)</span><span class="cl">Answer:</span> Beraisa #1 discusses Ispargus made with old wine:</p>
<p class="bas indent2"><span class="nm">1.</span><span class="cl">(Mishnah):</span> If one said, "Wine is forbidden to me [to drink] like a Korban, for it harms the intestines," and then he was told that old wine is good for the intestines, and he was silent:</p>
<p class="bas indent3"><span class="nm">i.</span>New wine is forbidden to him, old wine is permitted.</p>
<p class="bas indent1"><span class="nm">(d)</span><span class="cl">(Beraisa #3):</span> Six things were said about Ispargus:</p>
<p class="bas indent2"><span class="nm">1.</span>We make it only from raw wine, the cup must be full, one receives the cup with his right hand, holds it in his left hand when drinking, we do not talk after drinking it, we do not pause while drinking it, and one returns it only to the one from whom he received it, we spit after drinking it, after drinking it we eat only its own species.</p>
<p class="bas indent1"><span class="nm">(e)</span><span class="cl">Contradiction (Beraisa #4):</span> We eat only bread after drinking it.</p>
<p class="bas indent1"><span class="nm">(f)</span><span class="cl">Resolution:</span> Beraisa #4 discusses Ispargus of (i.e. it was soaked in) wine, Beraisa #3 discusses Ispargus of beer.</p>
<p class="bas indent1"><span class="nm">(g)</span><span class="cl">(Beraisa #2):</span> Ispargus is good for LA'aT and bad for RaMaT;</p>
<p class="bas indent1"><span class="nm">(h)</span><span class="cl">Contradiction (Beraisa #5):</span> Ispargus is good for RaMaT and bad for LA'aT.</p>
<p class="bas indent1"><span class="nm">(i)</span><span class="cl">Resolution:</span> Beraisa #2 discusses Ispargus of wine, Beraisa #5 discusses Ispargus of beer.</p>
<p class="bas indent1"><span class="nm">(j)</span><span class="cl">(Beraisa #6):</span> If one spits after drinking it, he will get sick;</p>
<p class="bas indent1"><span class="nm">(k)</span><span class="cl">Contradiction (Beraisa #7):</span> If one does not spit after drinking it, he will get sick.</p>
<p class="bas indent1"><span class="nm">(l)</span><span class="cl">Resolution:</span> Beraisa #6 discusses Ispargus of wine, Beraisa #7 discusses Ispargus of beer.</p>
<p class="bas indent1"><span class="nm">(m)</span><span class="cl">(Rav Ashi):</span> Since one who does not spit after drinking Ispargus of beer will get sick, one may spit even in front of a king.</p>
<p class="bas indent1"><span class="nm">(n)</span><span class="cl">(R. Yishmael ben Elisha):</span> Suri'el (an important angel) told me three things:</p>
<p class="bas indent2"><span class="nm">1.</span>Do not take your cloak from a servant in the morning to don it (rather, take it yourself); if someone has not yet washed his hands in the morning, he should not wash your hands; one returns a cup of Ispargus to the one from whom he received it;</p>
<p class="bas indent2"><span class="nm">2.</span>There are Shedim or damaging angels that wait for a person to get trapped on account of doing one of these things.</p>
<p class="bas indent1"><span class="nm">(o)</span><span class="cl">(R. Yehoshua ben Levi):</span> The angel of death told me three things:</p>
<p class="bas indent2"><span class="nm">1.</span>Do not take your cloak from a servant in the morning; someone who has not washed should not wash your hands in the morning; do not stand in front of women returning from a funeral, for then I dance in front of them holding my sword, and I have permission to damage.</p>
<p class="bas indent1"><span class="nm">(p)</span><span class="cl">Question:</span> If one encounters [women returning from a funeral], what should he do?</p>
<p class="bas indent1"><span class="nm">(q)</span><span class="cl">Answer:</span> He should move four Amos to the side;</p>
<p class="bas indent2"><span class="nm">1.</span>If there is a river to his side, he should cross it; if there is another road, he should take it; if there is a wall, he should go in back of it;</p>
<p class="bas indent2"><span class="nm">2.</span>If none of these is possible, he should face away and say, "va'Yomer Hash-m El ha'Satan Yig'ar Hash-m Becha..." until the women pass.</p>
<p class="bas subject"><span class="nm">3)</span>THE KOS SHEL BERACHAH</p>
<p class="bas indent1"><span class="nm">(a)</span><span class="cl">(R. Zeira):</span> Ten things were said about the Kos Shel Berachah (a cup of wine held during Birkas ha'Mazon and drunk afterwards -- all of them will be explained):</p>
<p class="bas indent2"><span class="nm">1.</span>It must be washed and rinsed;</p>
<p class="bas indent2"><span class="nm">2.</span>It must be Chai (Tosfos - whole; Rashi - initially, the wine should be undiluted) and full;</p>
<p class="bas indent2"><span class="nm">3.</span>It requires Itur and Ituf;</p>
<p class="bas indent2"><span class="nm">4.</span>One receives it with both hands, and puts it in his right hand;</p>
<p class="bas indent2"><span class="nm">5.</span>He lifts it a Tefach off the ground, and looks at it.</p>
<p class="bas indent2"><span class="nm">6.</span>Some say, he sends it for a gift to his wife (to taste from it).</p>
<p class="bas indent1"><span class="nm">(b)</span><span class="cl">(R. Yochanan):</span> We hold that only four of these are necessary -- it must be washed, rinsed, Chai, and full.</p>
<p class="bas indent1"><span class="nm">(c)</span><span class="cl">(Beraisa):</span> "Washing" means, from the inside; "rinsing" means, from the outside.</p>
<p class="bas indent1"><span class="nm">(d)</span><span class="cl">(R. Yochanan):</span> Anyone who blesses on a full cup receives an unlimited inheritance -- "u'Malei Birkas Hash-m Yam v'Darom Yerashah."</p>
<p class="bas indent1"><span class="nm">(e)</span><span class="cl">(R. Yosi bar Chanina):</span> [The extra "Yud" and "Hei" in "Yerashah" teach that] he inherits this world and the World to Come (which were created with these two letters).</p>
<p class="bas indent1"><span class="nm">(f)</span>To fulfill "Itur," Rav Yehudah would crown (surround) it with Talmidim;</p>
<p class="bas indent2"><span class="nm">1.</span>Rav Chisda would surround it with other cups.</p>
<p class="bas indent1"><span class="nm">(g)</span><span class="cl">(Rav Sheshes):</span> It should be Chai until Birkas ha'Aretz, then one adds water (Rif's text).</p>
<p class="bas indent1"><span class="nm">(h)</span>To fulfill "Ituf," Rav Papa would cloak himself with his Talis; Rav Asi would cover his head with a turban.</p>
<p class="bas indent1"><span class="nm">(i)</span><span class="cl">(Beraisa):</span> One receives it with both hands.</p>
<p class="bas indent1"><span class="nm">(j)</span><span class="cl">(R. Chanina bar Papa):</span> We learn from "Se'u Yedeichem Kodesh u'Varchu Es Hash-m."</p>
<p class="bas indent1"><span class="nm">(k)</span><span class="cl">(Beraisa):</span> He puts it in his right hand.</p>
<p class="bas indent1"><span class="nm">(l)</span><span class="cl">(R. Chiya bar Aba):</span> Early Chachamim were unsure whether or not the left hand may help support it.</p>
<p class="bas indent1"><span class="nm">(m)</span><span class="cl">(Rav Ashi):</span> Since early Chachamim were unsure, we are stringent.</p>
<p class="bas bbbline">51b----------------------------------------51b</p>
<p class="bas indent1"><span class="nm">(n)</span><span class="cl">(Beraisa):</span> He lifts it a Tefach off the ground.</p>
<p class="bas indent1"><span class="nm">(o)</span><span class="cl">(Rav Acha bar Chanina):</span> We learn from "Kos Yeshu'os Esa uv'Shem Hash-m Ekra."</p>
<p class="bas indent1"><span class="nm">(p)</span>He looks at it -- this is in order that he will not take his mind off it.</p>
<p class="bas indent1"><span class="nm">(q)</span>He sends it for a gift to his wife -- in order that she will be blessed.</p>
<p class="bas indent1"><span class="nm">(r)</span>Ula ate at Rav Nachman's house; he said Birkas ha'Mazon, and gave the Kos Shel Berachah to Rav Nachman.</p>
<p class="bas indent2"><span class="nm">1.</span><span class="cl">Rav Nachman:</span> You should send it to Yalsa (my wife)!</p>
<p class="bas indent2"><span class="nm">2.</span><span class="cl">(Ula):</span> [This is unnecessary, for] R. Yochanan (also, R. Nasan) taught that a woman's seed is blessed only through her husband -- "u'Verach Pri Vitnecha" (masculine), it does not say 'Pri Vitnah" (hers).</p>
<p class="bas indent2"><span class="nm">3.</span>Yalsa overheard this -- furiously, she broke 400 barrels of wine.</p>
<p class="bas indent2"><span class="nm">4.</span>Rav Nachman told Ula to send another cup to her; he did, telling her that all the wine in the barrel (i.e. also this cup is) Kos Shel Berachah.</p>
<p class="bas indent2"><span class="nm">5.</span><span class="cl">Yalsa:</span> People that go around cities talk a lot (of idle words -- also your words are vain); worn out clothing breeds lice (Iyun Yakov - the wearer tried to economize, he really loses -- likewise, you tried to save wine for my husband, and you caused more to be lost).</p>
<p class="bas subject"><span class="nm">4)</span>PROPER CONDUCT DURING <i>BIRKAS HA'MAZON</i></p>
<p class="bas indent1"><span class="nm">(a)</span><span class="cl">(Rav Asi):</span> It is forbidden (Rashi - for the Mezamen; most Poskim - for anyone) to talk from when the Kos Shel Berachah is picked up (until after it is drunk, after Birkas ha'Mazon).</p>
<p class="bas indent1"><span class="nm">(b)</span><span class="cl">(Rav Asi):</span> We do not bless [Birkas ha'Mazon] on a cup of punishments.</p>
<p class="bas indent1"><span class="nm">(c)</span><span class="cl">Question:</span> What is this?</p>
<p class="bas indent1"><span class="nm">(d)</span><span class="cl">Answer (Rav Nachman bar Yitzchak):</span> It is a second cup (anything done in pairs summons damage upon a person).</p>
<p class="bas indent1"><span class="nm">(e)</span><span class="cl">Support (Beraisa):</span> One should not say Birkas ha'Mazon over a cup of wine if it will cause him to drink an even number of cups [in all] -- "Hachon Likros Elokecha Yisrael" (bless Him in a nice way), not with pairs, as doing so brings problems.</p>
<p class="bas indent1"><span class="nm">(f)</span><span class="cl">(R. Avahu):</span> If one ate while walking, he should bless while standing still; if one ate while standing still, he should bless while sitting; if one ate while reclining, he should bless while sitting.</p>
<p class="bas indent1"><span class="nm">(g)</span>The Halachah is, in any case one should bless while sitting.</p>

<p class="bas subject"><span class="nm">5)</span>DIFFERENCES BETWEEN BEIS SHAMAI AND BEIS HILLEL IN A MEAL</p>
<p class="bas indent1"><span class="nm">(a)</span><span class="cl">(Mishnah):</span> Beis Shamai and Beis Hillel argue about the following things in a meal:</p>
<p class="bas indent2"><span class="nm">1.</span>Beis Shamai says, [in Kidush on Shabbos night,] first we bless ("Mekadesh ha'Shabbos") on the day, then we bless on the wine;</p>
<p class="bas indent2"><span class="nm">2.</span>Beis Hillel says, first we bless on the wine, then on the day.</p>
<p class="bas indent2"><span class="nm">3.</span>Beis Shamai says, first we wash the hands, then we mix (add water to the wine in) the cup;</p>
<p class="bas indent2"><span class="nm">4.</span>Beis Hillel says, first we mix the cup, then we wash the hands.</p>
<p class="bas indent2"><span class="nm">5.</span>Beis Shamai says, one cleans his hands with a napkin, and leaves it on the table;</p>
<p class="bas indent2"><span class="nm">6.</span>Beis Hillel says, we leave it on the pillow.</p>
<p class="bas indent2"><span class="nm">7.</span>Beis Shamai says, first we clean the place [where we ate], then we wash the hands [Mayim Acharonim];</p>
<p class="bas indent2"><span class="nm">8.</span>Beis Hillel says, first we wash, then we clean.</p>
<p class="bas indent2"><span class="nm">9.</span>Beis Shamai says, [if one must bless after the meal and say Havdalah on Motza'i Shabbos,] we make the Berachos in the following order -- on the light of the flame, Birkas ha'Mazon, spices, and Havdalah;</p>
<p class="bas indent2"><span class="nm">10.</span>Beis Hillel says, we bless on the light of the flame, spices, Birkas ha'Mazon, and Havdalah;</p>
<p class="bas indent2"><span class="nm">11.</span>Beis Shamai says, the text of the Berachah on light is "she'Bara Me'or ha'Esh";</p>
<p class="bas indent2"><span class="nm">12.</span>Beis Hillel says, it is "Borei Me'orei ha'Esh."</p>
<p class="bas indent1"><span class="nm">(b)</span>We may not bless on light or spices of an idolater, or of a corpse, or of idolatry;</p>
<p class="bas indent1"><span class="nm">(c)</span>We may not bless on light unless we can benefit from it;</p>
<p class="bas indent1"><span class="nm">(d)</span>Beis Shamai says, if someone ate and did not bless, he returns to his place and blesses;</p>
<p class="bas indent1"><span class="nm">(e)</span>Beis Hillel says, he blesses in the place he remembers.</p>
<p class="bas indent1"><span class="nm">(f)</span><span class="cl">Question:</span> How long after eating may one bless?</p>
<p class="bas indent1"><span class="nm">(g)</span><span class="cl">Answer:</span> He may bless until the food is digested.</p>
<p class="bas indent1"><span class="nm">(h)</span>If wine was brought during the meal, and there is enough only for one cup:</p>
<p class="bas indent2"><span class="nm">1.</span>Beis Shamai says, [if he wants,] he blesses on the wine, and afterwards Birkas ha'Mazon;</p>
<p class="bas indent2"><span class="nm">2.</span>Beis Hillel says, he blesses Birkas ha'Mazon, and afterwards on the wine.</p>
<p class="bas indent1"><span class="nm">(i)</span>We answer Amen after a Yisrael's Berachah;</p>
<p class="bas indent2"><span class="nm">1.</span>We do not answer Amen to a Kusi's Berachah unless we heard the entire Berachah.</p>
<p class="bas indent1"><span class="nm">(j)</span><span class="cl">(Gemara - Beraisa):</span> Beis Shamai and Beis Hillel argue about the following things in a meal:</p>
<p class="bas indent2"><span class="nm">1.</span>Beis Shamai says, first we bless on the day, then on the wine, for the day is the reason for the wine; also, the day began before we drink the wine;</p>
<p class="bas indent2"><span class="nm">2.</span>Beis Hillel says, first we bless on the wine, for it allows us to say Kidush;</p>
<p class="bas indent3"><span class="nm">i.</span>Another reason is, the Berachah on wine is Tadir (more frequent) than the Berachah of Kidush -- we always bless first on what is more Tadir.</p>
<p class="bas indent2"><span class="nm">3.</span>The Halachah follows Beis Hillel.</p>
<p class="bas indent1"><span class="nm">(k)</span><span class="cl">Question:</span> Why does Beis Hillel need a second reason? (Shitah - we do not ask why Beis Shamai gives two reasons, for he does not call it "another reason.")</p>
<p class="bas indent1"><span class="nm">(l)</span><span class="cl">Answer:</span> One might have thought, since Beis Shamai has two reasons, the Halachah follows him -- therefore, it teaches that Beis Hillel also has two reasons.</p>
<p class="bas indent1"><span class="nm">(m)</span><span class="cl">Question:</span> Why must it say that the Halachah follows Beis Hillel? This is obvious, a Bas Kol (voice from Heaven) announced that the Halachah follows Beis Hillel!</p>
<p class="bas indent1"><span class="nm">(n)</span><span class="cl">Answer #1:</span> This Beraisa was taught before the Bas Kol.</p>
<p class="bas indent1"><span class="nm">(o)</span><span class="cl">Answer #2:</span> It was after the Bas Kol -- it is like R. Yehoshua, who says that we do not heed a Bas Kol.</p>
