<p class="bas subject"><span class="nm">1)</span>WHAT REQUIRES <i>HECHSHER</i></p>
<p class="bas indent1"><span class="nm">(a)</span><span class="cl">(Beraisa - R. Yochanan ben Nuri):</span> A Kal va'Chomer teaches that it is Tamei. It has severe Tum'ah without intent. All the more so, it has mild Tum'ah without intent!</p>
<p class="bas indent1"><span class="nm">(b)</span><span class="cl">Chachamim:</span> You cannot learn from severe Tum'ah, for it is not <i>Yoredes l'Kach</i>.</p>
<p class="bas indent1"><span class="nm">(c)</span><span class="cl">Question:</span> What does this mean?</p>
<p class="bas indent1"><span class="nm">(d)</span><span class="cl">Answer #1 (Rava):</span> You cannot learn from severe Tum'ah, for it is not Metamei things to be like itself. (It is an Av ha'Tum'ah, but it does not make an Av.) Mild Tum'ah is! (Rashi - it is Metamei food, enabling that food to be Metamei food. Me'iri - a Rishon can make a Rishon, i.e. if it touches a liquid!)</p>
<p class="bas indent1"><span class="nm">(e)</span><span class="cl">Objection (Abaye):</span> You explain that this is a severity of mild Tum'ah. If so, Chachamim should agree that all the more so, mild Tum'ah does not require intent!</p>
<p class="bas indent1"><span class="nm">(f)</span><span class="cl">Answer #2 (Rav Sheshes):</span> You cannot learn from severe Tum'ah, which does not require Hechsher, to mild Tum'ah, which requires Hechsher!</p>
<p class="bas indent1"><span class="nm">(g)</span><span class="cl">Objection:</span> Mild Tum'ah does not require Hechsher!</p>
<p class="bas indent2"><span class="nm">1.</span><span class="cl">(Mishnah):</span> These are three laws of Nivlas Ohf Tahor (there are 13 in all) -- it requires intent, it is Metamei only in Beis ha'Bli'ah, and it does not require Hechsher (for mild Tum'ah).</p>
<p class="bas indent1"><span class="nm">(h)</span><span class="cl">Answer:</span> The Mishnah teaches that it does not require Hechsher through a Sheretz (i.e. it has Tum'ah even without touching Tum'ah), but it requires Hechsher through a liquid.</p>
<p class="bas indent1"><span class="nm">(i)</span><span class="cl">Objection:</span> It does not require Hechsher through a Sheretz due to R. Yishmael's teaching. Likewise, it should not require Hechsher through a liquid!</p>
<p class="bas indent2"><span class="nm">1.</span><span class="cl">(Tana d'Vei R. Yishmael):</span> "Kol Zera Zeru'a (is not Mekabel Tum'ah without Hechsher)." Hechsher is needed only for things like seeds, which will never have severe Tum'ah;</p>
<p class="bas indent2"><span class="nm">2.</span>This excludes Nivlas Ohf Tahor. Since it has severe Tum'ah, it does not need Hechsher.</p>
<p class="bas indent1"><span class="nm">(j)</span><span class="cl">Answer #3 (Rava):</span> You cannot learn from severe Tum'ah, which never requires Hechsher, to mild Tum'ah, which in some cases requires Hechsher!</p>
<p class="bas subject"><span class="nm">2)</span>INTENT OF THE PLANTING TAKES EFFECT</p>
<p class="bas indent1"><span class="nm">(a)</span><span class="cl">(Rava):</span> (R. Yochanan taught (50a-b) that intent for something attached has no effect regarding Kabalas Tum'ah.) R. Yochanan agrees that intent for something attached takes effect regarding Ma'aser:</p>
<p class="bas indent2"><span class="nm">1.</span><span class="cl">(Mishnah):</span> If the following were grown in a Chatzer and were guarded, Ma'aser applies to them -- mint, hyssop and savory.</p>
<p class="bas indent2"><span class="nm">2.</span><span class="cl">Question:</span> What is the case?</p>
<p class="bas indent3"><span class="nm">i.</span>If they were planted for the sake of people, this is obvious!</p>
<p class="bas indent2"><span class="nm">3.</span><span class="cl">Answer:</span> They were initially planted for the sake of animals, and it says that if they were guarded, Ma'aser applies to them!</p>
<p class="bas indent1"><span class="nm">(b)</span><span class="cl">Rejection (Rav Ashi):</span> No. The case is, they grew by themselves in a Chatzer. Stam (without any intent), it is assumed that people will eat them;</p>
<p class="bas indent2"><span class="nm">1.</span>The Mishnah teaches that if the produce is guarded in the Chatzer (it is not Hefker), Ma'aser applies to it. If not, it is exempt from Ma'aser.</p>
<p class="bas indent1"><span class="nm">(c)</span><span class="cl">Question (Rav Ashi - Mishnah):</span> Tum'as Ochlim applies to everything from which Ma'aseros must be taken.</p>
<p class="bas indent2"><span class="nm">1.</span>Tum'as Ochlim does not apply to them, therefore Ma'aseros do not apply!</p>
<p class="bas indent1"><span class="nm">(d)</span><span class="cl">Answer (Rava):</span> It means that Tum'as Ochlim applies to every <i>species</i> from which Ma'aseros must be taken. (If these were planted for people, they are Mekabel Tum'as Ochlim.)</p>
<p class="bas indent1"><span class="nm">(e)</span><span class="cl">Support #1 (Mishnah):</span> Matanos (the foreleg, jaw and stomach of a slaughtered Chulin animal is given to a Kohen) apply to everything that Reishis ha'Gez (first shearings) applies to.</p>
<p class="bas indent2"><span class="nm">1.</span><span class="cl">Question:</span> Reishis ha'Gez applies to a Terefah, but Matanos do not!</p>
<p class="bas indent2"><span class="nm">2.</span><span class="cl">(Answer #1:</span> We must say that the Mishnah discusses species, Matanos apply to every species that Reishis ha'Gez applies to!)</p>
<p class="bas indent1"><span class="nm">(f)</span><span class="cl">Rejection (and Answer #2 - Ravina):</span> No, that Mishnah is like R. Shimon:</p>
<p class="bas indent2"><span class="nm">1.</span><span class="cl">(Beraisa - R. Shimon):</span> Reishis ha'Gez does not apply to a Terefah.</p>
<p class="bas indent1"><span class="nm">(g)</span><span class="cl">Support #2 (Rav Simi Bar Ashi - Beraisa):</span> If one made his vineyard Hefker and promptly harvested it, he must leave Peret (loose grapes), Olelos (deficient clusters), Shichchah (what one forgot to take) and Pe'ah for the poor, but he is exempt from Ma'aseros.</p>
<p class="bas indent2"><span class="nm">1.</span><span class="cl">Contradiction (Mishnah):</span> Ma'aseros must be taken from everything from which Pe'ah must be left.</p>
<p class="bas indent2"><span class="nm">2.</span><span class="cl">Answer:</span> We must say that the Mishnah discusses species.</p>
<p class="bas indent1"><span class="nm">(h)</span><span class="cl">(Mishnah):</span> Chachamim agree with R. Akiva that one who plants dill and mustard in two or three places must leave Pe'ah from each.</p>
<p class="bas bbbline">51b----------------------------------------51b</p>
<p class="bas indent1"><span class="nm">(i)</span><span class="cl">Inference:</span> Since Pe'ah applies to dill, Ma'aser applies to it;</p>
<p class="bas indent2"><span class="nm">1.</span><span class="cl">(Mishnah):</span> Ma'aseros must be taken from everything from which Pe'ah must be left.</p>
<p class="bas indent2"><span class="nm">2.</span>Since Ma'aser applies to dill, it is Mekabel Tum'as Ochlim;</p>
<p class="bas indent2"><span class="nm">3.</span><span class="cl">Conclusion:</span> Tum'as Ochlim applies (even) to things like dill that are used only to season (but are not eaten by themselves)!</p>
<p class="bas indent1"><span class="nm">(j)</span><span class="cl">Contradiction (Mishnah - R. Akiva):</span> The following may be bought with money of Ma'aser Sheni, but they are not Mekabel Tum'as Ochlim -- Kosht (costus, a root), Chimum (a type of chrysanthemum), fragrant spices, Ti'ah (aconite), Chiltis (a plant used as a resin, its leaves are used as a spice and for medicines), (black) pepper, Chalas Chari'a (a lozenge made of saffron or safflower).</p>
<p class="bas indent2"><span class="nm">1.</span><span class="cl">R. Yochanan ben Nuri:</span> If they may be bought with Ma'aser money, they should be Mekabel Tum'as Ochlim. If they are not Mekabel Tum'as Ochlim, it should be forbidden to buy them with Ma'aser money!</p>
<p class="bas indent2"><span class="nm">2.</span><span class="cl">R. Yochanan ben Nuri:</span> Chachamim voted and decided that they may not be bought with Ma'aser money, and they are not Mekabel Tum'as Ochlim.</p>
<p class="bas indent1"><span class="nm">(k)</span><span class="cl">Answer #1 (Rav Chisda):</span> The Beraisa refers to dill planted to be ground and put into Kutach (a dip. Dill is the primary ingredient. It is considered like eating it by itself.)</p>
<p class="bas indent1"><span class="nm">(l)</span><span class="cl">Objection (Rav Ashi):</span> This implies that if dill was planted Stam, it is destined to be put in a pot (to give taste). This is wrong!</p>
<p class="bas indent1"><span class="nm">(m)</span><span class="cl">Answer #2 (Rav Ashi):</span> Rather, Stam dill is for the sake of Kutach!</p>
<p class="bas indent2"><span class="nm">1.</span><span class="cl">(Mishnah):</span> Once dill gives taste to a cooked food, Terumah and Tum'as Ochlim no longer apply to it (for no taste remains in it).</p>
<p class="bas indent2"><span class="nm">2.</span><span class="cl">Inference:</span> Before it gives taste, Terumah and Tum'as Ochlim apply to it!</p>
<p class="bas indent2"><span class="nm">3.</span>If Stam dill were to give taste, even before it gave taste, Terumah and Tum'as Ochlim would not apply to it!</p>
<p class="bas indent1"><span class="nm">(n)</span><span class="cl">Conclusion:</span> Stam dill is for Kutach.</p>
<p class="bas subject"><span class="nm">3)</span>MORE GENERAL RULES</p>
<p class="bas indent1"><span class="nm">(a)</span><span class="cl">(Mishnah):</span> Matanos apply to everything that Reishis ha'Gez applies to (sheep), and also to things exempt from Reishis ha'Gez (cattle and goats).</p>
<p class="bas indent1"><span class="nm">(b)</span>(Shevi'is, i.e. produce with Kedushas Shemitah, must be made Hefker in the field. One may not make a business of selling it. It must be eaten in the normal way. When a species of Shemitah produce is no longer available in the field for wild animals, one must do Bi'ur, i.e. burn it (Rambam), make it Hefker (Ramban), or give it to appointees of Beis Din (Ra'avad).) Shevi'is applies to everything that Bi'ur applies to, and also to something exempt from Bi'ur.</p>
<p class="bas indent1"><span class="nm">(c)</span><span class="cl">(Gemara):</span> Shevi'is and Bi'ur apply to the following -- leaves of the wild Luf (a type of onion) and mint (and almost all produce);</p>
<p class="bas indent1"><span class="nm">(d)</span>Shevi'is applies to the roots of wild Luf and of mint, but they are exempt from Bi'ur. "Veli'Vhemtecha vela'Chayah Asher b'Artzecha Tiheyeh Chol Tevu'asah Le'echol" -- as long as it is available for Chayos to eat in the field, you may (eat and) feed your animals in the house;</p>
<p class="bas indent2"><span class="nm">1.</span>When it ceases for Chayos in the field, you must expel it from your house;</p>
<p class="bas indent2"><span class="nm">2.</span>These roots never cease from the field.</p>
<p class="bas indent1"><span class="nm">(e)</span><span class="cl">(Mishnah):</span> Every species (of fish) that has Kaskeses (scales) has Senapir (fins). Some species have Senapir, but not Kaskeses;</p>
<p class="bas indent1"><span class="nm">(f)</span>Every species (of animal) that has horns (Tosfos Chulin 59a - this refers to horns with certain Simanim that show that it is a Chayah) has (split) hooves (it is Kosher);</p>
<p class="bas indent2"><span class="nm">1.</span>Some species have hooves but not horns.</p>
<p class="bas indent1"><span class="nm">(g)</span><span class="cl">(Gemara):</span> 'Every species that has Kaskeses' refers to Tahor fish;</p>
<p class="bas indent1"><span class="nm">(h)</span>Some species have Senapir but not Kaskeses. These species are Teme'im.</p>
<p class="bas indent1"><span class="nm">(i)</span><span class="cl">Question:</span> If we see that a fish has Kaskeses, it is permitted. Why did the Torah also require Senapir?</p>
<p class="bas indent1"><span class="nm">(j)</span><span class="cl">Answer:</span> Had the Torah said only Kaskeses, one might have thought that this means fins, and he would mistakenly permit Tamei species. Therefore, it wrote Senapir and Kaskeses.</p>
<p class="bas indent1"><span class="nm">(k)</span><span class="cl">Question:</span> How did the Tana know which is which?</p>
<p class="bas indent1"><span class="nm">(l)</span><span class="cl">Answer:</span> It says "v'Shiryon Kaskasim Hu Lavush" (armor is like scales).</p>
<p class="bas indent1"><span class="nm">(m)</span><span class="cl">Question:</span> Since we learn from a verse, the Torah could have written just Kaskeses! (Until Sefer Shmuel (which contains the above verse) was written, we would rely on a tradition from Moshe from Sinai.)</p>
<p class="bas indent1"><span class="nm">(n)</span><span class="cl">Answer (R. Avahu):</span> The Torah includes it for grandeur. (According to the opinion (in Tosfos Chulin 66b) that a tradition from Sinai teaches that every fish with Kaskeses has Senapir, perhaps Senapir is written to prove Divine authorship of the Torah. No human could know this from investigation, like the Gemara says (Chulin 60b) about the Shesu'ah - P.F.)</p>
<p class="bas subject"><span class="nm">4)</span>SOMETHING ON WHICH WE BLESS ONLY BEFOREHAND</p>
<p class="bas indent1"><span class="nm">(a)</span><span class="cl">(Mishnah):</span> Anything that requires a Berachah afterwards requires a Berachah beforehand, but there is something that requires a Berachah beforehand but does not require a Berachah afterwards.</p>
<p class="bas indent1"><span class="nm">(b)</span><span class="cl">Question:</span> What does this (Seifa) refer to?</p>
<p class="bas indent1"><span class="nm">(c)</span><span class="cl">Answer #1:</span> It refers to Yerek (vegetables).</p>
<p class="bas indent1"><span class="nm">(d)</span><span class="cl">Question:</span> According to R. Yitzchak, who says that we bless after Yerek, what does it refer to?</p>
<p class="bas indent1"><span class="nm">(e)</span><span class="cl">Answer #2:</span> It refers to water.</p>
<p class="bas indent1"><span class="nm">(f)</span><span class="cl">Question:</span> According to Rav Papa, who says that we bless after water, what does it refer to?</p>
<p class="bas indent1"><span class="nm">(g)</span><span class="cl">Answer #3:</span> It refers to Mitzvos. (We bless beforehand, but not afterwards.)</p>
<p class="bas indent1"><span class="nm">(h)</span><span class="cl">Question:</span> In Eretz Yisrael, after removing Tefilin they bless "Asher Kideshanu b'Mitzvosav v'Tzivanu Lishmor Chukav." What does the Mishnah exempt (from a Berachah Acharonah)?</p>
