<p class="bas subject"><span class="nm">1)</span>THE READING ON <i>YOM KIPUR</i></p>
<p class="bas indent1"><span class="nm">(a)</span><span class="cl">(Mishnah):</span> He reads from the Parshiyos "Acharei Mos" and "Ach be'Asor."</p>
<p class="bas indent1"><span class="nm">(b)</span><span class="cl">Contradiction (Mishnah):</span> One may skip from Parshah to Parshah when reading (for the Tzibur) from the Nevi'im, but not when reading the Torah.</p>
<p class="bas indent1"><span class="nm">(c)</span><span class="cl">Answer #1 (Abaye):</span> One may skip (when reading the Torah) only if the Torah can be rolled to the next Parshah within the time that the translator translates the last verse.</p>
<p class="bas indent1"><span class="nm">(d)</span><span class="cl">Objection (Beraisa):</span> One may skip when reading from the prophets, but not when reading the Torah. The skip must be so short that the Sefer can be rolled to the next Parshah within the time that the translator translates the last verse.</p>
<p class="bas indent2"><span class="nm">1.</span><span class="cl">Inference:</span> Even such a skip is forbidden in the Torah!</p>
<p class="bas indent1"><span class="nm">(e)</span><span class="cl">Answer #2 (Abaye):</span> One may skip to a related Parshah, but not to an unrelated Parshah.</p>
<p class="bas indent2"><span class="nm">1.</span><span class="cl">Support (Beraisa):</span> One may skip in the Torah to a related Parshah. In Nevi'im, one may skip even to an unrelated Parshah. In both cases, we must be able to roll the Sefer to the next Parshah within the time to translate the last verse;</p>
<p class="bas indent2"><span class="nm">2.</span>We may not skip from one Navi to another. This is only allowed within the 12 minor Nevi'im, and even then not backwards.</p>
<p class="bas indent1"><span class="nm">(f)</span><span class="cl">(Mishnah):</span> He rolls the Torah (and says 'there is more written...)'</p>
<p class="bas indent1"><span class="nm">(g)</span><span class="cl">Question:</span> Why must he say this?</p>
<p class="bas indent1"><span class="nm">(h)</span><span class="cl">Answer:</span> We are concerned lest people say that the Sefer Torah is missing Parshiyos.</p>
<p class="bas indent1"><span class="nm">(i)</span><span class="cl">(Mishnah):</span> He reads by heart the Parshah (of Korbanos Musaf of Yom Kipur) in Sefer Bamidbar.</p>
<p class="bas indent1"><span class="nm">(j)</span><span class="cl">Question:</span> Why doesn't he roll the Sefer Torah and read from it?</p>
<p class="bas indent1"><span class="nm">(k)</span><span class="cl">Answer (Rav Sheshes):</span> We do not roll a Sefer Torah in a Tzibur.</p>
<p class="bas indent1"><span class="nm">(l)</span><span class="cl">Question:</span> Why don't they bring a second Sefer Torah, and he can read from it?</p>
<p class="bas indent1"><span class="nm">(m)</span><span class="cl">Answer #1 (Rav Huna bar Yehudah):</span> We are concerned lest people say that they brought a second Sefer because the first is invalid.</p>
<p class="bas indent1"><span class="nm">(n)</span><span class="cl">Answer #2 (Reish Lakish):</span> This would case an unnecessary Berachah (on reading from the second Sefer).</p>
<p class="bas indent1"><span class="nm">(o)</span><span class="cl">Question (against Rav Huna bar Yehudah):</span> We are not concerned lest people say that a Sefer is invalid!</p>
<p class="bas indent2"><span class="nm">1.</span><span class="cl">(R. Yitzchak Nafcha):</span> When Rosh Chodesh Teves falls on Shabbos, we take out three Sifrei Torah. In one we read from the usual weekly Parshah. In one, we read Korbanos Musaf of Rosh Chodesh. In one, we read what is appropriate for (that day, i.e. the sixth or seventh of) Chanukah.</p>
<p class="bas indent1"><span class="nm">(p)</span><span class="cl">Answer:</span> People will not say that the Sefer is invalid if three people read from three Sefarim, but they will say so if one person reads from two Sefarim.</p>
<p class="bas subject"><span class="nm">2)</span>THE BERACHOS</p>
<p class="bas indent1"><span class="nm">(a)</span><span class="cl">(Mishnah):</span> He blesses eight Berachos...</p>
<p class="bas indent1"><span class="nm">(b)</span><span class="cl">(Beraisa):</span> He blesses for Keri'as ha'Torah, like we do in the Beis ha'Keneses; for Avodas ha'Mikdash, of thanks, and forgiveness of sin, as enacted (like we say these three in Shemoneh Esreh); a special Berachah for the Mikdash; a special Berachah for the Kohanim; a special Berachah for Yisrael; and a special Berachah for Yerushalayim.</p>
<p class="bas indent1"><span class="nm">(c)</span><span class="cl">(Mishnah):</span> ...And the rest of the prayer.</p>
<p class="bas indent1"><span class="nm">(d)</span><span class="cl">(Beraisa):</span> This is supplication, joyous song, and request, that Your nation Yisrael needs salvation... He concludes 'He who hears prayer.'</p>
<p class="bas indent2"><span class="nm">1.</span>After this, everyone brings his Sefer Torah from his house and reads in it.</p>
<p class="bas indent2"><span class="nm">2.</span><span class="cl">Question:</span> What is the reason?</p>
<p class="bas indent2"><span class="nm">3.</span><span class="cl">Answer:</span> This is so all will see its beauty.</p>
<p class="bas subject"><span class="nm">3)</span>THE KING'S READING</p>
<p class="bas indent1"><span class="nm">(a)</span><span class="cl">(Mishnah):</span> The king reads the night after the first day of Sukos, in the eighth, in the year after Shemitah - "at the end of seven years, in the festival..."</p>
<p class="bas indent1"><span class="nm">(b)</span>They make a podium of wood in the courtyard, and he sits on it.</p>
<p class="bas indent1"><span class="nm">(c)</span>The overseer of the Beis ha'Keneses would give the Sefer Torah to the head of the Beis ha'Keneses, who gives it to the Sgan, who gives it to the Kohen Gadol, who gives it to the king.</p>
<p class="bas indent1"><span class="nm">(d)</span>The king stands up and receives the Torah and sits down and reads. King Agripas read standing, and Chachamim praised him for this.</p>
<p class="bas indent2"><span class="nm">1.</span>When he read "you may not put a foreigner (to be king) upon yourselves", tears flowed from his eyes.</p>
<p class="bas indent2"><span class="nm">2.</span><span class="cl">Chachamim:</span> Don't worry. You are our brother!</p>
<p class="bas indent1"><span class="nm">(e)</span>He reads from the beginning of Sefer Devarim until Shema Yisrael; the Parshiyos of Shema Yisrael and "v'Hayah Im Shamo'a"; "tithe" and "when you will finish tithing"; the Parshah of the king; and the Berachos and curses (on Har Gerizim and Har Eival, and the other curses in Ki Savo).</p>
<p class="bas indent1"><span class="nm">(f)</span>The king makes the same Berachos like the Kohen Gadol, except that he substitutes a Berachah for the festival in place of the Berachah for forgiveness of sin.</p>
<p class="bas indent1"><span class="nm">(g)</span><span class="cl">(Gemara) Question:</span> Can it really be bi'Shmini (the masculine form of 'eighth', i.e. the eighth day of Sukos)?!</p>
<p class="bas indent1"><span class="nm">(h)</span><span class="cl">Answer:</span> The text should say 'bi'Shminis' (feminine, i.e. the eighth year of the Shemitah cycle).</p>
<p class="bas indent1"><span class="nm">(i)</span><span class="cl">Question:</span> Why does it say "at the end of seven years, in the festival, the Shemitah year, on the festival of Sukos"? Some of this is unnecessary!</p>
<p class="bas indent1"><span class="nm">(j)</span><span class="cl">Answer:</span> Had it said only "at the end of seven years", one might have thought that we count seven years after Moshe said this (in Arvos Mo'av), even if it is not Shemitah. Therefore, it says "the Shemitah year";</p>
<p class="bas indent2"><span class="nm">1.</span>Had it said only "the Shemitah year", one might have thought it is at the end of the year. Therefore, it says "during the Mo'ed."</p>
<p class="bas indent2"><span class="nm">2.</span>Had it said only "during the Mo'ed", one might have thought it is Rosh Hashanah. Therefore, it says "during Sukos."</p>
<p class="bas indent2"><span class="nm">3.</span>Had it said only "during Sukos", one might have thought it can be even the last day of Yom Tov. Therefore, it says "when all of Yisrael come", i.e. at the beginning of the festival.</p>

<p class="bas indent1"><span class="nm">(k)</span><span class="cl">(Mishnah):</span> The overseer of the Beis ha'Keneses gives the Sefer Torah to the head of the Beis ha'Keneses...</p>
<p class="bas indent2"><span class="nm">1.</span><span class="cl">Suggestion:</span> This shows that one may honor a Talmid in front of his Rebbi.</p>
<p class="bas indent1"><span class="nm">(l)</span><span class="cl">Rejection (Abaye):</span> No, this is all done to honor the king.</p>
<p class="bas indent1"><span class="nm">(m)</span><span class="cl">(Mishnah):</span> The king stands up and receives the Torah, and sits down and reads. King Agripas read standing...</p>
<p class="bas indent1"><span class="nm">(n)</span><span class="cl">Inference:</span> This implies that he was sitting before this.</p>
<p class="bas indent1"><span class="nm">(o)</span><span class="cl">Question:</span> Only kings of the Davidic line may sit in the Mikdash!</p>
<p class="bas indent1"><span class="nm">(p)</span><span class="cl">Answer:</span> This takes place in the Ezras Nashim (where one may sit), like Rav Chisda said (elsewhere).</p>
<p class="bas indent1"><span class="nm">(q)</span><span class="cl">(Mishnah):</span> Chachamim praised him for this.</p>
<p class="bas indent1"><span class="nm">(r)</span><span class="cl">Question:</span> Rav Ashi taught, even the opinion that permits a Nasi (the theocratic head of Yisrael) to pardon his honor does not allow a king to do so!</p>
<p class="bas indent2"><span class="nm">1.</span>"Place, you will place a king upon yourself" - his fear must be upon you.</p>
<p class="bas indent1"><span class="nm">(s)</span><span class="cl">Answer:</span> A king may pardon his honor for a Mitzvah.</p>
<p class="bas subject"><span class="nm">4)</span>FLATTERY</p>
<p class="bas indent1"><span class="nm">(a)</span><span class="cl">(Mishnah):</span> When he read "you may not put..."</p>
<p class="bas indent1"><span class="nm">(b)</span><span class="cl">(Beraisa - R. Nasan):</span> When they told him that he was their brother (i.e. fit to be king), the haters of (a euphemism) Yisrael deserved to be destroyed for flattering him.</p>
<p class="bas indent1"><span class="nm">(c)</span><span class="cl">(R. Shimon ben Chalafta):</span> From the day that flattery became rampant, judgments became distorted, deeds became spoiled, and no one can say 'my deeds are greater than yours.'</p>
<p class="bas indent1"><span class="nm">(d)</span><span class="cl">(R. Yehudah bar Ma'arava):</span> One may flatter the wicked in this world - "(in the world to come) a base person will not be called generous, the drunkard will not be called 'master'."</p>
<p class="bas indent2"><span class="nm">1.</span><span class="cl">Inference:</span> This is permitted in this world.</p>
<p class="bas indent1"><span class="nm">(e)</span><span class="cl">(Reish Lakish):</span> We learn this from Yakov, who told Esav "(seeing you) is like seeing the countenance of Elokim, and I found favor with you."</p>
<p class="bas indent1"><span class="nm">(f)</span>This is unlike R. Levi.</p>
<p class="bas indent2"><span class="nm">1.</span><span class="cl">(R. Levi):</span> What Yakov told Esav is like a man who was invited to eat, and sensed that his host wanted to kill him. He told his host 'this food tastes like what I ate by the king';</p>
<p class="bas indent2"><span class="nm">2.</span>The host thought that the king knows the guest, and he was afraid to kill him.</p>
<p class="bas indent1"><span class="nm">(g)</span><span class="cl">(R. Elazar):</span> Any flatterer brings anger to the world - "flatterers at heart put anger." Also, his prayer is not heard - "they will not be saved when afflicted."</p>
<p class="bas indent1"><span class="nm">(h)</span><span class="cl">(R. Elazar):</span> Even fetuses in the womb curse one who flatters.</p>
<p class="bas indent1"><span class="nm">(i)</span><span class="cl">(R. Elazar):</span> Any one who flatters falls into Gehinom.</p>
<p class="bas indent1"><span class="nm">(j)</span><span class="cl">(R. Elazar):</span> If Reuven flatters Shimon, he will eventually fall into Shimon's hands. If not, he will fall into the hands of Shimon's sons, or grandsons. We learn from Yirmeyahu, who supported Chananyah's false prophecy. Chananyah's grandson later handed Yirmeyahu over to the Babylonians.</p>
