<p class="dedicationbox">SANHEDRIN 16 (Tisha b'Av) - Dedicated by Rabbi Dr. Eli Turkel of Ra'anana, Israel, in memory of his father, Reb Yisrael Shimon ben Shlomo ha'Levi, whose Yahrzeit is on 10 Av. </p>

<p class="bas subject"><span class="nm">1)</span>THINGS THAT REQUIRE 71 JUDGES</p>
<p class="bas indent1"><span class="nm">(a)</span><span class="cl">Answer #3 (Ula):</span> The Mishnah discusses inheritances of Shevatim, like the initial inheritance of Eretz Yisrael.</p>
<p class="bas indent2"><span class="nm">1.</span>Just like the initial inheritance of Eretz Yisrael required 71 judges, also future inheritances.</p>
<p class="bas indent1"><span class="nm">(b)</span><span class="cl">Rejection:</span> If so, just like the initial inheritance of Eretz Yisrael required a lottery, the Urim v'Tumim and the presence of all of Yisrael, also future inheritances should!</p>
<p class="bas indent2"><span class="nm">1.</span>Rather, we must answer like Rav Masnah.</p>
<p class="bas indent1"><span class="nm">(c)</span><span class="cl">Defense of Answer #1 (Ravina):</span> Really, it was enticed to serve idolatry;</p>
<p class="bas indent2"><span class="nm">1.</span>Granted, the transgressors are killed like individuals, by stoning, but they must be judged by the Great Sanhedrin.</p>
<p class="bas indent2"><span class="nm">2.</span><span class="cl">(R. Chama bar Yosi):</span> "V'Hotzeisa Es ha'Ish ha'Hu Oh Es ha'Ishah... El She'arecha" - you take a man or woman (who served idolatry) to your gates, but you do not take an entire city to your gates (rather, to the Great Sanhedrin, to be judged like an Ir ha'Nidachas);</p>
<p class="bas indent2"><span class="nm">3.</span>Likewise, you take a man or woman to your gates, but not an entire Shevet to your gates.</p>
<p class="bas indent1"><span class="nm">(d)</span><span class="cl">(Mishnah):</span> Seventy-one judges are needed to judge a false Navi.</p>
<p class="bas indent1"><span class="nm">(e)</span><span class="cl">Question:</span> What is the source of this?</p>
<p class="bas indent1"><span class="nm">(f)</span><span class="cl">Answer #1 (R. Yosi bar Chanina):</span> He learns from a Gezerah Shavah "Hazadah-Hazadah" from Zaken Mamrei. Just like a Zaken Mamrei is judged by 71, also a false Navi.</p>
<p class="bas indent1"><span class="nm">(g)</span><span class="cl">Objection:</span> It says "Hazadah" regarding the death of a Zaken Mamrei, and this can be through a Beis Din of 23 (on condition that he rebelled against the Great Sanhedrin)!</p>
<p class="bas indent1"><span class="nm">(h)</span><span class="cl">Answer #2 (Reish Lakish):</span> He learns from a Gezerah Shavah "Davar-Davar" from the rebellion of a Zaken Mamrei. Just like he must rebel against 71, also a false Navi must be judged by 71.</p>
<p class="bas indent1"><span class="nm">(i)</span><span class="cl">Question:</span> After having learned that a false Navi must be judged by 71, he should learn from "Hazadah-Hazadah" <i>to</i> Zaken Mamrei that 71 judges are required to kill him!</p>
<p class="bas indent1"><span class="nm">(j)</span><span class="cl">Answer:</span> He has a tradition (from Moshe from Sinai) for "Davar-Davar", but he has no tradition for "Hazadah- Hazadah." (One needs a tradition to learn from a Gezerah Shavah.)</p>
<p class="bas subject"><span class="nm">2)</span>JUDGING A KOHEN GADOL</p>
<p class="bas indent1"><span class="nm">(a)</span><span class="cl">(Mishnah):</span> (Seventy-one judges are needed to judge) a Kohen Gadol (in capital cases).</p>
<p class="bas indent1"><span class="nm">(b)</span><span class="cl">Question:</span> What is the source of this?</p>
<p class="bas indent1"><span class="nm">(c)</span><span class="cl">(Rav Ada bar Ahavah):</span> "Kol ha'Davar ha'Gadol Yavi'u Elecha" refers to matters of a Gadol.</p>
<p class="bas indent1"><span class="nm">(d)</span><span class="cl">Question (Beraisa #1):</span> 'Davar Gadol' refers to a difficult matter;</p>
<p class="bas indent2"><span class="nm">1.</span><span class="cl">Question:</span> Perhaps it refers to matters of a Gadol!</p>
<p class="bas indent2"><span class="nm">2.</span><span class="cl">Answer:</span> "Es ha'Davar ha'Kasheh Yevi'un El Moshe" shows that it refers to difficult matters.</p>
<p class="bas indent1"><span class="nm">(e)</span><span class="cl">Answer:</span> Rav Ada bar Ahavah holds like the following Tana.</p>
<p class="bas indent2"><span class="nm">1.</span><span class="cl">(Beraisa #2):</span> 'Davar Gadol' refers to a matters of a Gadol;</p>
<p class="bas indent2"><span class="nm">2.</span><span class="cl">Question:</span> Perhaps it refers to difficult matters!</p>
<p class="bas indent2"><span class="nm">3.</span><span class="cl">Answer:</span> "Es ha'Davar ha'Kasheh Yevi'un El Moshe" already teaches about difficult matters, so 'Davar Gadol' must refer to a matters of a Gadol.</p>
<p class="bas indent1"><span class="nm">(f)</span><span class="cl">Question:</span> According to the first Tana (i.e. Beraisa #1), why do we need two verses to teach about difficult matters?</p>
<p class="bas indent1"><span class="nm">(g)</span><span class="cl">Answer:</span> One was the command to bring the difficult matters to Moshe. The other teaches that they actually did so.</p>
<p class="bas indent2"><span class="nm">1.</span>The second Tana says, if they referred to the same thing, both verses would use the same word ('Gadol' or 'Kasheh');</p>
<p class="bas indent2"><span class="nm">2.</span>Since the verses use different words, they refer to different things.</p>
<p class="bas indent1"><span class="nm">(h)</span><span class="cl">Question (R. Elazar):</span> How many judges are required to kill the Kohen Gadol's ox?</p>
<p class="bas indent2"><span class="nm">1.</span>Do we say that the Torah equates killing the ox to killing its owner, so 71 are required?</p>
<p class="bas indent2"><span class="nm">2.</span>Or, do we equate it to killing a regular owner, so 23 suffice?</p>
<p class="bas indent1"><span class="nm">(i)</span><span class="cl">Inference (Abaye):</span> R. Elazar only asked regarding killing his ox, for it is clear to him that three suffice to judge a Kohen Gadol in monetary cases.</p>
<p class="bas indent1"><span class="nm">(j)</span><span class="cl">Question:</span> This is obvious!</p>
<p class="bas indent1"><span class="nm">(k)</span><span class="cl">Answer:</span> One might have thought that "Kol ha'Davar ha'Gadol" teaches about <i>all</i> matters of a Gadol. Abaye teaches that this is not so.</p>
<p class="bas subject"><span class="nm">3)</span>THINGS THAT REQUIRE 71 JUDGES</p>
<p class="bas indent1"><span class="nm">(a)</span><span class="cl">(Mishnah):</span> Seventy-one judges are needed to decide to go to an optional war;</p>
<p class="bas indent1"><span class="nm">(b)</span><span class="cl">Question:</span> What is the source of this?</p>
<p class="bas indent1"><span class="nm">(c)</span><span class="cl">Answer #1 (R. Avahu):</span> "V'Lifnei Elazar...";</p>
<p class="bas indent2"><span class="nm">1.</span>"Hu" refers to (Yehoshua, who will be) the king. "V'Chol Bnei Yisrael Ito" refers to the Meshu'ach Milchamah (the Kohen who speaks to the soldiers in war). "V'Chol ha'Edah" refers to the Sanhedrin.</p>
<p class="bas indent1"><span class="nm">(d)</span><span class="cl">Rejection:</span> Perhaps the verse does not refer to deciding to go to war. Rather, it teaches for whose needs we ask of the Urim v'Tumim! (Mesores ha'Shas - it is difficult to resolve this with Yoma 73b. There, R. Avahu himself expounds this verse to teach for whose needs we ask of the Urim v'Tumim! Perhaps R. Avahu retracted after he heard this rejection. Alternatively, the text here should say 'ked'Amar R. Avahu...' - <b>PF</b>)</p>
<p class="bas indent1"><span class="nm">(e)</span><span class="cl">Answer #2:</span> We learn from Rav Acha bar Bizna's teaching.</p>
<p class="bas indent2"><span class="nm">1.</span><span class="cl">(Rav Acha bar Bizna):</span> There was a harp above David'd bed. At midnight, the north wind would start blowing, making music. David would wake up and learn Torah until morning.</p>
<p class="bas indent2"><span class="nm">2.</span>In the morning, Chachamim came and said that Yisrael cannot finance themselves. David authorized them to go to war.</p>
<p class="bas indent2"><span class="nm">3.</span>They took counsel with Achisofel and the Sanhedrin, and asked the Urim v'Tumim.</p>
<p class="bas indent2"><span class="nm">4.</span><span class="cl">(Rav Yosef):</span> Rav Acha learns from "v'Acharei Achitofel Yehoyada ben Benayahu v'Evyasar v'Sar Tzava la'Melech Yo'av";</p>
<p class="bas bbbline">16b----------------------------------------16b</p>
<p class="bas indent3"><span class="nm">i.</span>Achisofel was for counsel - "v'Atzas Achisofel Asher Ya'atz (was like asking Hash-m)"</p>
<p class="bas indent3"><span class="nm">ii.</span>Yehoyada ben Benayahu was the head of the Sanhedrin. Evyasar would ask from the Urim v'Tumim - "u'Vnayahu ben Yehoyada Al ha'Keresi veha'Pelesi" (first, Benayahu ben Yehoyada was head of the Sanhedrin. Later, his son Yehoyada was the head).</p>
<p class="bas indent3"><span class="nm">iii.</span><span class="cl">Question:</span> Why is the Urim v'Tumim called Keresi and Pelesi?</p>
<p class="bas indent3"><span class="nm">iv.</span><span class="cl">Answer:</span> Keresi - they Kores (cut, i.e. enforce) their words. Pelesi - their acts are Mufla'im (wondrous).</p>
<p class="bas indent3"><span class="nm">v.</span>Later, they went to "Sar Tzava la'Melech Yo'av."</p>
<p class="bas indent2"><span class="nm">5.</span><span class="cl">Question:</span> What is the source that the harp would arouse David?</p>
<p class="bas indent2"><span class="nm">6.</span><span class="cl">Answer:</span> "Urah Chevodi Urah ha'Nevel v'Chinor A'irah ha'Shachar."</p>
<p class="bas indent1"><span class="nm">(f)</span><span class="cl">(Mishnah):</span> Seventy-one judges are needed to add to Yerushalayim.</p>
<p class="bas indent1"><span class="nm">(g)</span><span class="cl">Question:</span> What is the source of this?</p>
<p class="bas indent1"><span class="nm">(h)</span><span class="cl">Answer (Rav Simi bar Chiya):</span> "K'Chol Asher Ani Mar'eh Osecha Es Tavnis ha'Mishkan v'Es Tavnis Kol Kelav <i>v'Chen Ta'asu</i>" (Moshe, who is like 71, supervised the building of the Mishkan and its Kelim) - you must do similarly for future generations.</p>
<p class="bas indent1"><span class="nm">(i)</span><span class="cl">Question (Rava - Beraisa):</span> All the Kelim that Moshe made were anointed (with oil) to Mekadesh them for the Avodah;</p>
<p class="bas indent2"><span class="nm">1.</span>For future Kelim, using them for Avodah is Mekadesh them.</p>
<p class="bas indent2"><span class="nm">2.</span>We do not say 'you must do similarly for future generations'!</p>
<p class="bas indent1"><span class="nm">(j)</span><span class="cl">Answer:</span> A verse teaches that future Kelim are not anointed. "Va'Yimshachem va'Ykadesh <i>Osam</i>" - they were anointed, but future Kelim will not be anointed.</p>
<p class="bas indent1"><span class="nm">(k)</span><span class="cl">Question:</span> Perhaps they were anointed, but future Kelim may be inaugurated through anointing or Avodah!</p>
<p class="bas indent1"><span class="nm">(l)</span><span class="cl">Answer (Rav Papa):</span> "Asher <i>Yesharasu</i> Vam ba'Kodesh" teaches that Sherus (Avodah) is Mekadesh them.</p>
<p class="bas indent1"><span class="nm">(m)</span><span class="cl">Question:</span> If so, what do we learn from "Osam"?</p>
<p class="bas indent1"><span class="nm">(n)</span><span class="cl">Answer:</span> Had it not said "Osam", one might have thought that future Kelim are inaugurated through anointing <i>and</i> Avodah, to fulfill "v'Chen Ta'asu";</p>
<p class="bas indent2"><span class="nm">1.</span>"<i>Osam</i>" teaches that they were anointed, but future Kelim will not be anointed.</p>
<p class="bas indent1"><span class="nm">(o)</span><span class="cl">(Mishnah):</span> Seventy-one judges are needed to establish a Sanhedrin for a Shevet.</p>
<p class="bas indent1"><span class="nm">(p)</span><span class="cl">Question:</span> What is the source of this?</p>
<p class="bas indent1"><span class="nm">(q)</span><span class="cl">Answer:</span> Moshe set up a Sanhedrin for each Shevet, and he is like 71.</p>
<p class="bas indent1"><span class="nm">(r)</span>(Beraisa) We learn that we must set up judges in Yisrael from "Shofetim (v'Shoterim) Titen"; we learn to set up Shoterim (people to strike those who do not obey the judge) in Yisrael from "v'Shoterim Titen";</p>
<p class="bas indent2"><span class="nm">1.</span>We learn that we must set up judges (and Shoterim) for every Shevet from "Shofetim... li'Shvatecha" (and "v'Shoterim...  li'Shvatecha");</p>

<p class="bas indent2"><span class="nm">3.</span><span class="cl">Version #1 (Rashi):</span> R. Yehudah says, one (Great) Sanhedrin is appointed over all of them - "Titen Lecha."</p>
<p class="bas indent2"><span class="nm">4.</span><span class="cl">Version #2 (Tosfos):</span> R. Yehudah says, one (the greatest Chacham, the Av Beis Din) is appointed over the Beis Din - "Titen Lecha."</p>
<p class="bas indent2"><span class="nm">5.</span>R. Shimon ben Gamliel says, "li'Shvatecha v'Shofetu" teaches that each Shevet should judge the people of its Shevet.</p>
<p class="bas subject"><span class="nm">4)</span>MAKING AN IR HA'NIDACHAS</p>
<p class="bas indent1"><span class="nm">(a)</span><span class="cl">(Mishnah):</span> Seventy-one judges are needed to make an Ir ha'Nidachas (a city destroyed because its majority served idolatry).</p>

<p class="bas indent1"><span class="nm">(c)</span><span class="cl">Answer (R. Chiya bar Yosef):</span> "V'Hotzeisa Es ha'Ish ha'Hu Oh Es ha'Ishah... El She'arecha" - you take a man or woman to your gates, but you do not take an entire city to your gates (rather, to the Great Sanhedrin).</p>
<p class="bas indent1"><span class="nm">(d)</span><span class="cl">(Mishnah):</span> We do not make an Ir ha'Nidachas near the border of Eretz Yisrael.</p>

<p class="bas indent1"><span class="nm">(f)</span><span class="cl">(Mishnah):</span> We do not make three such cities.</p>
<p class="bas indent1"><span class="nm">(g)</span>We learn from "Achas". However, we may make two, for it says "Arecha."</p>
<p class="bas indent1"><span class="nm">(h)</span><span class="cl">(Beraisa):</span> "Achas" - we may not make three;</p>
<p class="bas indent1"><span class="nm">(i)</span><span class="cl">Suggestion:</span> Perhaps this teaches that we may not make even two!</p>
<p class="bas indent1"><span class="nm">(j)</span><span class="cl">Rejection:</span> "Arecha" teaches that we may make two. "Achas" must exclude three.</p>
<p class="bas indent1"><span class="nm">(k)</span><span class="cl">(Rav):</span> One Beis Din may not make three such cities, but different Batei Din may make three cities.</p>
<p class="bas indent1"><span class="nm">(l)</span>A different time, Rav taught that even different Batei Din may not make three cities.</p>
<p class="bas indent1"><span class="nm">(m)</span><span class="cl">Question:</span> What is the reason?</p>
<p class="bas indent1"><span class="nm">(n)</span><span class="cl">Answer:</span> We do not want to make Eretz Yisrael desolate.</p>
