<p class="bas indent1"><span class="nm">(a)</span><span class="cl">(Beraisa - R. Akiva):</span> Once, I followed R. Yehoshua into a bathroom. I learned three things there:</p>
<p class="bas indent2"><span class="nm">1.</span>We do not face east-west at the time, rather, north-south; we do not eliminate standing up, rather, sitting; we do not clean with the right hand, rather, with the left. (Maharsha - R. Akiva could see that it would have been easier for R. Yehoshua to face east-west, and to stand, and to clean with the right hand -- surely, he refrained because it is improper.)</p>
<p class="bas indent1"><span class="nm">(b)</span><span class="cl">Ben Azai (to R. Akiva):</span> How could you be so brazen as to follow your Rebbi into the bathroom (and look at him there)?!</p>

<p class="bas indent1"><span class="nm">(e)</span><span class="cl">Answer #1 (Rava):</span> This is because the Torah was given with Hash-m's right hand -- "mi'Mino Esh Das Lamo";</p>
<p class="bas indent1"><span class="nm">(f)</span><span class="cl">Answer #2 (Rabah bar bar Chanah):</span> This is because people regularly put the right hand in the mouth;</p>
<p class="bas indent1"><span class="nm">(g)</span><span class="cl">Answer #3 (Reish Lakish):</span> This is because the right hand is used to tie Tefilin (on the left arm);</p>
<p class="bas indent1"><span class="nm">(h)</span><span class="cl">Answer #4 (Rav Nachman bar Yitzchak):</span> This is because it is used to show Ta'amei Torah (the musical notes for reading Torah; the notes are written in a Sefer, or he waves his hand like a conductor).</p>
<p class="bas indent1"><span class="nm">(i)</span>[Some] Tana'im argue like [some of] these Amora'im:</p>
<p class="bas indent2"><span class="nm">1.</span><span class="cl">(Beraisa - R. Eliezer):</span> [The right hand is not used because] people normally use it to eat;</p>
<p class="bas indent2"><span class="nm">2.</span>R. Yehoshua says, because people write [Divrei Kedushah] with it;</p>
<p class="bas indent2"><span class="nm">3.</span>R. Akiva says, the right hand is used to show Ta'amim.</p>
<p class="bas indent1"><span class="nm">(j)</span><span class="cl">(Rav Tanchum bar Chanilai):</span> Anyone who is Tzanu'a (gentle, quiet and does not expose more than necessary) in the bathroom is saved from three things -- from snakes, scorpions and Mazikim (Rashi - they are not aroused to make trouble for him; Maharsha - his accompanying angels protect him from them);</p>
<p class="bas indent2"><span class="nm">1.</span>Some say, even his dreams are not disturbed [by Mazikin].</p>
<p class="bas indent1"><span class="nm">(k)</span>[Even though, normally, Mazikin only bother people alone at night,] there was a bathroom in Tiverya in which even two people would be damaged during the day; R. Ami and R. Asi went in, one at a time, and were not harmed.</p>

<p class="bas indent1"><span class="nm">(p)</span><span class="cl">Answer:</span> A goat's name (Sa'ir) is like that of the Shedim of bathrooms ("u'Se'irim Yerakdu Sham"), they can be confused (and he might be harmed).</p>
<p class="bas indent1"><span class="nm">(q)</span>Before Rava became Rosh Yeshivah, when he relieved himself, Rav Chisda's daughter (his wife) would put a nut in a copper box and make noise outside;</p>

<p class="bas indent1"><span class="nm">(a)</span><span class="cl">(Ula):</span> One may relieve himself immediately in back of the fence; in a valley, he should go far enough that no one will hear if he passes gas (even if he can be seen).</p>

<p class="bas indent1"><span class="nm">(c)</span><span class="cl">Question (against Isi - Mishnah):</span> People pressing olives b'Taharah eliminate in back of the fence, the olives and oil remain Tahor (Rashi; Rosh - the pressers (Amei ha'Aretz) remain Tehorim, we are not concerned that they touched Tum'ah).</p>
<p class="bas indent1"><span class="nm">(d)</span><span class="cl">Answer:</span> Chachamim were lenient (about how far one must distance himself) for the sake of [guarding] Taharos.</p>
<p class="bas indent1"><span class="nm">(e)</span><span class="cl">Question (against Isi - Mishnah) Question:</span> How far may one go and retain his Chezkas Taharah?</p>

<p class="bas indent1"><span class="nm">(f)</span><span class="cl">Answer #1:</span> Chachamim were lenient [about a bathroom] for the sake of Taharos (they were not lenient about Taharos for one who wants to be Tzanu'a in Beis ha'Kisei).</p>
<p class="bas indent1"><span class="nm">(g)</span><span class="cl">Answer #2 (Rav Ashi):</span> Isi meant, what he exposes should not be seen, but he himself may be seen.</p>
<p class="bas indent1"><span class="nm">(h)</span>A eulogizer said in front of Rav Nachman, "[The deceased] was very Tzanu'a."</p>
<p class="bas indent2"><span class="nm">1.</span><span class="cl">Rav Nachman:</span> Did you enter the bathroom with him, to see if he was Tzanu'a there?</p>

<p class="bas indent1"><span class="nm">(i)</span><span class="cl">Question:</span> Why did Rav Nachman care if the deceased was really Tzanu'a or not?</p>
<p class="bas indent1"><span class="nm">(j)</span><span class="cl">Answer (Beraisa):</span> Just like the deceased are punished (Aruch - for their sins; Rosh (Mo'ed Katan 3:63) - when they are praised for merits they did not have at all, this arouses judgment against them), also [false] eulogizers and those who endorse their words are punished.</p>
<p class="bas indent1"><span class="nm">(k)</span><span class="cl">(Beraisa):</span> A Tzanu'a is one who eliminates in the same place (i.e. as far away) at night as he does during the day.</p>
<p class="bas indent1"><span class="nm">(l)</span><span class="cl">Objection #1:</span> Rav Yehudah taught that one should accustom himself to eliminate [before light of] morning and evening, in order that he will not have to distance himself!</p>

<p class="bas indent2"><span class="nm">1.</span>Also [at night] R. Zeira would tell his servant to make sure that there were no people in back of the meeting house in order that he could go there!</p>
<p class="bas indent1"><span class="nm">(n)</span><span class="cl">Answer #1:</span> Rather, a Tzanu'a is one who makes in the same <i>way</i> (exposing himself no more than he must) at night as he does during the day.</p>
<p class="bas indent1"><span class="nm">(o)</span><span class="cl">Answer #2 (Rav Ashi):</span> Really, it refers to the same place; the case is, there is a corner out of view (one must use it, and not an exposed place).</p>
<p class="bas indent1"><span class="nm">(p)</span><span class="cl">(Rav Yehudah):</span> One should accustom himself to eliminate morning and evening, in order that he will not have to distance himself.</p>

<p class="bas indent1"><span class="nm">(e)</span><span class="cl">(R. Elazar):</span> "L'Hasech" teaches that he covered ("Sikech") himself like a Sukah (to avoid being exposed).</p>

(Iyun Yakov - even though he cut it to convince Shaul not to pursue him, he did not have to cut the entire corner; Ben Yehoyada - there were Tzitzis on it, he could have cut a different part to avoid invalidating the Mitzvah.)</p>
<p class="bas indent1"><span class="nm">(g)</span><span class="cl">(R.
