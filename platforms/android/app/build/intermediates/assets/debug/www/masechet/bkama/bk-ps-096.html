<p class="bas subject"><span class="nm">1)</span>IMPROVEMENTS ON STOLEN PROPERTY</p>
<p class="bas indent1"><span class="nm">(a)</span><span class="cl">(Rava):</span> If a thief stole and improved property, and then sold or bequeathed it, the sale or inheritance takes effect on the increased value (Rashi - a half, third or quarter of it; alternatively, the entire increased value. This is an enactment to facilitate repentance).</p>
<p class="bas indent1"><span class="nm">(b)</span><span class="cl">Question (Rava):</span> If the buyer improved the land, what is the law?</p>
<p class="bas indent1"><span class="nm">(c)</span><span class="cl">Answer (Rava):</span> When one sells, he sells all rights he has in the matter. (Just like if the thief improved it, he would get (all or some) of the improvements, also the buyer.)</p>
<p class="bas indent1"><span class="nm">(d)</span><span class="cl">Question (Rava):</span> If a Nochri (thief) improved the land, what is the law?</p>
<p class="bas indent2"><span class="nm">1.</span><span class="cl">Question (Rav Acha mi'Difti):</span> Should we make enactments for Nochrim?!</p>
<p class="bas indent2"><span class="nm">2.</span><span class="cl">Answer (Ravina):</span> The case is, the Nochri sold it to a Yisrael.</p>
<p class="bas indent2"><span class="nm">3.</span><span class="cl">Question:</span> Still, one who acquired land through a Nochri has no more rights than the Nochri had!</p>
<p class="bas indent2"><span class="nm">4.</span><span class="cl">Answer:</span> The case is, the Nochri bought it from a Yisrael thief, and then sold it to a Yisrael.</p>
<p class="bas indent3"><span class="nm">i.</span>Do we say that since a Yisrael stole it and now a Yisrael owns it, the enactment applies?</p>
<p class="bas indent3"><span class="nm">ii.</span>Or, since a Nochri owned it in between, there is no enactment?</p>
<p class="bas indent1"><span class="nm">(e)</span>This question is unsettled.</p>
<p class="bas subject"><span class="nm">2)</span>CHANGES TO STOLEN OBJECTS</p>
<p class="bas indent1"><span class="nm">(a)</span><span class="cl">(Rav Papa):</span> If Reuven stole a date tree and cut it down, even if he plants it in his own property, he did not acquire it.</p>
<p class="bas indent1"><span class="nm">(b)</span><span class="cl">Question:</span> What is the reason?</p>
<p class="bas indent1"><span class="nm">(c)</span><span class="cl">Answer:</span> Originally, it was called a date tree, and also now!</p>
<p class="bas indent1"><span class="nm">(d)</span>If he stole a date tree and made logs out of it, he did not acquire them, for they are called date logs (the name has not been lost).</p>
<p class="bas indent1"><span class="nm">(e)</span>If he stole logs and made beams, he acquired them.</p>
<p class="bas indent1"><span class="nm">(f)</span>If he stole long beams and cut them into small beams, he did not acquire them.</p>
<p class="bas indent2"><span class="nm">1.</span>If he made boards out of them, he acquired them.</p>
<p class="bas indent1"><span class="nm">(g)</span><span class="cl">(Rava):</span> If one stole a Lulav and pulled off the leaves, he acquired it. Originally, it was called a Lulav, and now it is leaves.</p>
<p class="bas indent1"><span class="nm">(h)</span>If one stole Lulav leaves and made a broom (by cutting each leaf in half), he acquired it. Originally, it was leaves, now it is a broom.</p>
<p class="bas indent1"><span class="nm">(i)</span>If one stole a broom and made it into a rope, he did not acquire it, for he can untie it, and have a broom again.</p>
<p class="bas indent1"><span class="nm">(j)</span><span class="cl">Question (Rav Papa):</span> If the middle leaf was split, what is the law?</p>
<p class="bas indent1"><span class="nm">(k)</span><span class="cl">Version #1 - Answer:</span> We may learn from R. Mason, who said that if the middle leaf was removed, it is disqualified.</p>
<p class="bas bbbline">96b----------------------------------------96b</p>
<p class="bas indent2"><span class="nm">1.</span><span class="cl">Suggestion:</span> Also if it was split, it is disqualified. (Therefore, this is a change, and a thief acquires through it.)</p>
<p class="bas indent1"><span class="nm">(l)</span><span class="cl">Rejection:</span> No, only removal disqualifies it, for then it is lacking.</p>
<p class="bas indent1"><span class="nm">(m)</span><span class="cl">Version #2 - Answer:</span> We may learn from R. Mason, who said that if the middle leaf was split, it is as if it was removed, and it is disqualified. (end of Version #2)</p>
<p class="bas subject"><span class="nm">3)</span>REVERSIBLE CHANGES</p>
<p class="bas indent1"><span class="nm">(a)</span><span class="cl">(Rav Papa):</span> If one stole dirt and made a brick, he did not acquire it, because he can return it to dirt.</p>
<p class="bas indent1"><span class="nm">(b)</span>If one stole a brick and made it into dirt, he acquired.</p>
<p class="bas indent1"><span class="nm">(c)</span><span class="cl">Question:</span> We should say that he can make a brick again, so he did not acquire!</p>
<p class="bas indent1"><span class="nm">(d)</span><span class="cl">Answer:</span> It would be a different brick.</p>
<p class="bas indent1"><span class="nm">(e)</span><span class="cl">(Rav Papa):</span> If one stole a lump of silver and made a Zuz (coin), he did not acquire, because he can return it to a lump of silver.</p>
<p class="bas indent1"><span class="nm">(f)</span>If one stole a Zuz and made it a lump of silver, he acquires.</p>
<p class="bas indent1"><span class="nm">(g)</span><span class="cl">Question:</span> We should say that he can make a Zuz again, so he did not acquire!</p>
<p class="bas indent1"><span class="nm">(h)</span><span class="cl">Answer:</span> It would not be the same as originally.</p>
<p class="bas indent1"><span class="nm">(i)</span>If one stole a black (i.e. old) coin and made it like new, he did not acquire;</p>
<p class="bas indent1"><span class="nm">(j)</span>If he blackened a new coin, he acquired.</p>
<p class="bas indent1"><span class="nm">(k)</span><span class="cl">Question:</span> We should say that he can make it new again!</p>
<p class="bas indent1"><span class="nm">(l)</span><span class="cl">Answer:</span> It would be recognizable that it was once blackened.</p>
<p class="bas subject"><span class="nm">4)</span>WHEN THE STOLEN OBJECT APPRECIATES IN VALUE</p>
<p class="bas indent1"><span class="nm">(a)</span><span class="cl">(Mishnah):</span> The general rule is, all thieves pay like at the time of the theft.</p>
<p class="bas indent1"><span class="nm">(b)</span><span class="cl">Question:</span> What does this rule come to include?</p>
<p class="bas indent1"><span class="nm">(c)</span><span class="cl">Answer:</span> It includes R. Ila'a's case. One stole a lamb or calf and it became a ram or bull. He acquires it through this change;</p>
<p class="bas indent2"><span class="nm">1.</span>If he slaughtered or sold it, he slaughtered or sold his own animal (he is exempt from four or five).</p>
<p class="bas indent1"><span class="nm">(d)</span>A man stole a yoke of oxen, plowed and seeded with them, and then returned them.</p>
<p class="bas indent2"><span class="nm">1.</span><span class="cl">Rav Nachman:</span> Evaluate the increased value (the owner receives it).</p>
<p class="bas indent2"><span class="nm">2.</span><span class="cl">Rava:</span> Are the oxen the only cause of the increased value, and not the land?!</p>
<p class="bas indent2"><span class="nm">3.</span><span class="cl">Rav Nachman:</span> I meant that the owner should receive half.</p>
<p class="bas indent2"><span class="nm">4.</span><span class="cl">Rava:</span> Still, the stolen object returns intact, like the Mishnah says 'all thieves pay as at the time of the theft'! (Why should the owner profit?)</p>
<p class="bas indent2"><span class="nm">5.</span><span class="cl">Rav Nachman:</span> This man has stolen many times, so I want to fine him.</p>
<p class="bas subject"><span class="nm">5)</span>WHEN THE STOLEN OBJECT DEPRECIATED</p>
<p class="bas indent1"><span class="nm">(a)</span><span class="cl">(Mishnah):</span> If a man stole an animal or slaves and they grew old, he pays like at the time of the theft;</p>
<p class="bas indent1"><span class="nm">(b)</span>R. Meir says, regarding slaves, he can say 'here are your slaves (because slaves are never considered to be stolen).'</p>
<p class="bas indent1"><span class="nm">(c)</span>If he stole a coin and it cracked, or produce and it rotted, or wine and it soured, he pays like at the time of the theft.</p>
<p class="bas indent1"><span class="nm">(d)</span>If he stole a coin and it was disqualified, or Terumah and it became Tamei, or Chametz and Pesach came, or an animal and a person slept with it or served it like idolatry or it (received a minor blemish, and) was disqualified from being a Korban, or if it was being taken to be stoned, he can say 'here is your animal.'</p>
<p class="bas indent1"><span class="nm">(e)</span><span class="cl">(Gemara - Rav Papa):</span> The Mishnah discusses not only an animal that became truly old, rather, even if it became weaker.</p>
<p class="bas indent1"><span class="nm">(f)</span><span class="cl">Question:</span> The Mishnah says 'it became old'!</p>
<p class="bas indent1"><span class="nm">(g)</span><span class="cl">Answer:</span> It means, it became weaker in a way that resembles growing old, i.e. it will not get better.</p>
<p class="bas indent1"><span class="nm">(h)</span><span class="cl">(Mar Kashisha, citing R. Yochanan):</span> Even if he stole a lamb or calf and it became a ram or bull, he acquires it through this change;</p>
<p class="bas indent2"><span class="nm">1.</span>If he slaughtered or sold it, he slaughtered or sold his own animal (and is exempt from four or five).</p>
<p class="bas indent1"><span class="nm">(i)</span><span class="cl">Rav Ashi:</span> R. Ila'a taught that law, not R. Yochanan.</p>
<p class="bas subject"><span class="nm">6)</span>STEALING SLAVES</p>
<p class="bas indent1"><span class="nm">(a)</span><span class="cl">(Mishnah - R. Meir):</span> Regarding slaves, he can say 'here are your slaves.</p>
<p class="bas indent1"><span class="nm">(b)</span><span class="cl">(R. Chanina bar Avdimi, citing Rav):</span> The Halachah follows R. Meir.</p>
<p class="bas indent1"><span class="nm">(c)</span><span class="cl">Question:</span> Why did Rav rule like R. Meir against Chachamim?</p>
<p class="bas indent1"><span class="nm">(d)</span><span class="cl">Answer:</span> A Beraisa switches the opinions.</p>
<p class="bas indent1"><span class="nm">(e)</span><span class="cl">Question:</span> Why should Rav rule like the Beraisa against the Mishnah?</p>
<p class="bas indent1"><span class="nm">(f)</span><span class="cl">Answer:</span> Rav also switches the opinions in our Mishnah.</p>
<p class="bas indent1"><span class="nm">(g)</span><span class="cl">Question:</span> Rather, he should switch the opinions in the Beraisa to conform to the Mishnah!</p>
<p class="bas indent1"><span class="nm">(h)</span><span class="cl">Answer #1:</span> Rav's text of the Mishnah was like the Beraisa (i.e. unlike our text of the Mishnah).</p>
<p class="bas indent1"><span class="nm">(i)</span><span class="cl">Answer #2:</span> We switch a Mishnah when two Beraisos teach to the contrary (the following Beraisa, and a Beraisa just like our Mishnah but with the opinions switched).</p>
<p class="bas indent2"><span class="nm">1.</span><span class="cl">(Beraisa - R. Meir):</span> If Reuven traded his cow for Levi's donkey, and the cow gave birth, or, he sold a slave, and she gave birth (and the cow or slave was not here at the time):</p>
<p class="bas indent2"><span class="nm">2.</span>If one party says, I owned the mother at the time of birth (so the child is mine), and the other party is silent, the party claiming the child gets it;</p>
<p class="bas indent2"><span class="nm">2.</span>If both parties are unsure, they each own half the child;</p>
<p class="bas indent2"><span class="nm">3.</span>If both parties claim the child, the original owner of the mother swears that he still owned her at the time of birth (and he gets the child), for mid'Oraisa, the one who swears does not pay.</p>
<p class="bas indent2"><span class="nm">4.</span>Chachamim say, we do not swear about land or slaves (because slaves are equated to land. Likewise, they cannot be stolen.)</p>
<p class="bas indent1"><span class="nm">(j)</span><span class="cl">Question:</span> If Rav rules like (the opinion he attributes to) Chachamim, he should say 'the Halachah follows Chachamim'!</p>
<p class="bas indent1"><span class="nm">(k)</span><span class="cl">Answer:</span> He teaches that according to our text (in the Mishnah), the Halachah follows R. Meir.</p>
