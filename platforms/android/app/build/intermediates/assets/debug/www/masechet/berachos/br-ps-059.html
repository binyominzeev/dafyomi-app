<p class="bas subject"><span class="nm">1)</span>THE STARS TAKEN FROM <i>KIMAH</i></p>
<p class="bas indent1"><span class="nm">(a)</span><span class="cl">Question:</span> What is the meaning of Ash?</p>
<p class="bas indent1"><span class="nm">(b)</span><span class="cl">Answer (Rav Yehudah):</span> It is Yusa.</p>
<p class="bas indent1"><span class="nm">(c)</span><span class="cl">Question:</span> What is the meaning of Yusa?</p>
<p class="bas indent1"><span class="nm">(d)</span><span class="cl">Answer:</span> Some say that it is the tail of Teleh, some say that it is the head of Eglah (calf).</p>
<p class="bas indent1"><span class="nm">(e)</span>Presumably, it is the tail of Teleh -- "v'Ayish Al Baneha Sanchem" (it is consoled for the loss of its children); Ayish looks like it had holes [was lacking stars], and was beaten flat;</p>
<p class="bas indent2"><span class="nm">1.</span>It follows [Kimah], seeking to get back its children.</p>
<p class="bas indent2"><span class="nm">2.</span>When Hash-m brought the flood, he took two stars from Kimah (to allow the water to come down); later, he took two stars from Ayish to seal the hole.</p>
<p class="bas indent2"><span class="nm">3.</span><span class="cl">Question:</span> Why didn't He return the same stars he took?</p>
<p class="bas indent2"><span class="nm">4.</span><span class="cl">Answer #1:</span> A pit cannot be filled from the dirt excavated when digging it.</p>
<p class="bas indent2"><span class="nm">5.</span><span class="cl">Answer #2:</span> The Kateigor (prosecution) cannot become the Saneigor (defender; likewise, the punisher cannot become the remedy).</p>
<p class="bas indent2"><span class="nm">6.</span><span class="cl">Question:</span> Why didn't He create two new stars to plug the holes?</p>
<p class="bas indent2"><span class="nm">7.</span><span class="cl">Answer:</span> "Ein Kol Chadash Tachas ha'Shemesh."</p>
<p class="bas indent1"><span class="nm">(f)</span><span class="cl">(Rav Nachman):</span> In the future, Hash-m will return them to her -- v'Ayish Al Baneha Sanchem."</p>
<p class="bas subject"><span class="nm">2)</span>HIS MIGHT FILLS THE WORLD</p>
<p class="bas indent1"><span class="nm">(a)</span><span class="cl">(Mishnah):</span> On Zo'os...</p>
<p class="bas indent1"><span class="nm">(b)</span><span class="cl">Question:</span> What are Zo'os?</p>
<p class="bas indent1"><span class="nm">(c)</span><span class="cl">Answer (Rav Katina):</span> They are earthquakes.</p>
<p class="bas indent1"><span class="nm">(d)</span>Rav Katina was walking; when he came to the door of Uva Tamya (a Ba'al Ov, i.e. one who conjures up the dead), the land shook greatly.</p>
<p class="bas indent1"><span class="nm">(e)</span><span class="cl">Question (Rav Katina):</span> What causes earthquakes?</p>
<p class="bas indent1"><span class="nm">(f)</span><span class="cl">Answer #1 (Uva):</span> When Hash-m remembers his children dwelling in pain amidst the Nochrim, two tears descend into Yam ha'Gadol, the sound is heard all over the world -- this causes earthquakes!</p>
<p class="bas indent1"><span class="nm">(g)</span><span class="cl">Katina:</span> You are a liar! If so, earthquakes should come two at a time (one for each tear)!</p>
<p class="bas indent1"><span class="nm">(h)</span>This is not proper disproof; indeed, earthquakes are double;</p>
<p class="bas indent2"><span class="nm">1.</span>Rav Katina did not praise his explanation lest people would admire Uva and be led astray.</p>
<p class="bas indent1"><span class="nm">(i)</span>(Rav Nisim Ga'on, cited by ha'Kosev in Ein Yakov - the anthropomorphisms of Hash-m are parables to convey that everything that Hash-m does in the world is for the sake of Yisrael.)</p>
<p class="bas indent1"><span class="nm">(j)</span><span class="cl">Answer #2 (Rav Katina):</span> [Earthquakes come when] Hash-m claps his hands -- "v'Gam Ani Akeh Chapi El Kapi v'Hanichosi Chamasi."</p>
<p class="bas indent1"><span class="nm">(k)</span><span class="cl">Answer #3 (R. Nasan):</span> Hash-m is Mis'ane'ach (sighs over the afflictions he put on Yisrael) -- "v'Hanichosi Chamasi Bam v'Hinechamti."</p>
<p class="bas indent1"><span class="nm">(l)</span><span class="cl">Answer #4 (Rabanan):</span> He kicks the firmament -- "Heidad k'Dorchim...."</p>
<p class="bas indent1"><span class="nm">(m)</span><span class="cl">Answer #5 (Rav Acha bar Yakov):</span> He presses his legs under the Kisei ha'Kavod -- "ha'Shamayim Kis'i veha'Aretz Hadom Raglai."</p>
<p class="bas indent1"><span class="nm">(n)</span><span class="cl">(Mishnah):</span> On thunder...</p>
<p class="bas indent1"><span class="nm">(o)</span><span class="cl">Question:</span> What causes thunder?</p>
<p class="bas indent1"><span class="nm">(p)</span><span class="cl">Answer #1 (Shmuel):</span> Clouds brush against [each other; alternatively, bang into] the Galgal (great sphere in heaven that revolves around the earth) -- "Kol Ra'amcha ba'Galal He'iru Verakim Tevel...."</p>
<p class="bas indent1"><span class="nm">(q)</span><span class="cl">Answer #2 (Rabanan):</span> Clouds pour water one to another -- "l'Kol Tito Hamon Mayim ba'Shamayim."</p>
<p class="bas indent1"><span class="nm">(r)</span><span class="cl">Answer #3 (Rav Acha bar Yakov):</span> Lightning breaks up hailstones in clouds."</p>
<p class="bas indent1"><span class="nm">(s)</span><span class="cl">Answer #4 (Rav Ashi):</span> Wind blows over the "mouths" of hollow clouds -- it makes a sound, just like wind over an open barrel.</p>
<p class="bas indent1"><span class="nm">(t)</span>Presumably, Rav Acha bar Yakov is right -- we see lightning, hear thunder and rain comes (from the broken hail).</p>
<p class="bas subject"><span class="nm">3)</span>WINDS, LIGHTNING AND CLOUDS</p>
<p class="bas indent1"><span class="nm">(a)</span><span class="cl">(Mishnah):</span> On Ruchos...</p>
<p class="bas indent1"><span class="nm">(b)</span><span class="cl">(Abaye):</span> These are Za'afa (whirlwinds).</p>
<p class="bas indent1"><span class="nm">(c)</span><span class="cl">(Abaye):</span> Za'afa do not come at night.</p>
<p class="bas indent1"><span class="nm">(d)</span><span class="cl">Question:</span> We see them at night!</p>
<p class="bas indent1"><span class="nm">(e)</span><span class="cl">Answer:</span> They start during the day.</p>
<p class="bas indent1"><span class="nm">(f)</span><span class="cl">(Abaye):</span> Za'afa do not last for two hours -- "Lo Sakum Pa'amayim Tzarah."</p>
<p class="bas indent1"><span class="nm">(g)</span><span class="cl">Question:</span> We see, they last for two hours!</p>
<p class="bas indent1"><span class="nm">(h)</span><span class="cl">Answer:</span> There is a break in the middle.</p>
<p class="bas indent1"><span class="nm">(i)</span><span class="cl">(Mishnah):</span> On Barakim one says, "Blessed is He whose might fills the world."</p>
<p class="bas indent1"><span class="nm">(j)</span><span class="cl">(Rava):</span> Barakim is Barka (lightning).</p>
<p class="bas indent1"><span class="nm">(k)</span><span class="cl">(Rava):</span> All of the following are bad -- a single flash of lightning, white or green lightning, clouds that leave [the sky] from the west and return from the south, and two clouds that encounter each other.</p>
<p class="bas indent1"><span class="nm">(l)</span><span class="cl">Question:</span> Why is this important for us to know?</p>
<p class="bas indent1"><span class="nm">(m)</span><span class="cl">Answer:</span> One should pray for mercy.</p>
<p class="bas indent1"><span class="nm">(n)</span>This applies only at night; during the day, they are not bad.</p>
<p class="bas indent1"><span class="nm">(o)</span><span class="cl">(R. Shmuel bar Yitzchak):</span> Morning clouds are insubstantial -- "v'Chasdechem ka'Anan Boker...."</p>
<p class="bas indent1"><span class="nm">(p)</span><span class="cl">Question (Rav Papa):</span> People say, if it rains when you open the door in the morning, don't go to buy wheat (there will be much rain, wheat will be cheap)!</p>
<p class="bas indent1"><span class="nm">(q)</span><span class="cl">Answer (Abaye):</span> If the sky is covered by thick clouds, it is a sign of much rain, but nothing will come from thin clouds.</p>
<p class="bas indent1"><span class="nm">(r)</span><span class="cl">(R. Alexandri):</span> Hash-m made thunder to straighten crookedness of the heart -- "veha'Elokim Asah she'Yir'u mi'Lefanav."</p>
<p class="bas subject"><span class="nm">4)</span>WHICH BLESSINGS ARE MADE?</p>
<p class="bas indent1"><span class="nm">(a)</span><span class="cl">(R. Alexandri):</span> If one sees a rainbow in a cloud, he must fall on his face [for it is a vision of His glory] -- "ka'Mar'eh ha'Keshes Asher Yiheyeh ve'Anan... va'Er'eh va'Epol Al Panai."</p>
<p class="bas indent1"><span class="nm">(b)</span>In Eretz Yisrael, they vehemently opposed this, for it looks like he bows to the rainbow;</p>
<p class="bas indent2"><span class="nm">1.</span>However, one must bless, "Baruch Zocher ha'Bris" (He remembers the covenant).</p>
<p class="bas indent1"><span class="nm">(c)</span><span class="cl">(Beraisa - R. Yishmael, son of R. Yochanan ben Berokah):</span> One blesses, "He is faithful about His covenant and fulfills His word."</p>
<p class="bas indent1"><span class="nm">(d)</span><span class="cl">(Rav Papa):</span> Therefore, we say both of them -- "Baruch Zocher ha'Bris v'Ne'eman bi'Vriso  v'Kayam b'Ma'amaro."</p>
<p class="bas indent1"><span class="nm">(e)</span><span class="cl">(Mishnah):</span> If one sees mountains or hills... [he says, "Blessed is He who makes [works of] creation"].</p>
<p class="bas indent1"><span class="nm">(f)</span><span class="cl">Question:</span> Was nothing mentioned previously in the Mishnah a work of creation?! It says "Berakim la'Matar Asah"!</p>
<p class="bas indent1"><span class="nm">(g)</span><span class="cl">Answer #1 (Abaye):</span> [Even though the Mishnah says that we recite only "she'Kocho u'Gevuraso Malei Olam" on phenomena, and "Oseh Ma'aseh Bereishis" on stable sights,] both blessings apply to both of them.</p>
<p class="bas indent1"><span class="nm">(h)</span><span class="cl">Answer #2 (Rava):</span> Both blessings apply to phenomena (Tosfos - one makes one blessing or the other), only "Oseh Ma'aseh Bereishis" is said for sights.</p>
<p class="bas indent1"><span class="nm">(i)</span><span class="cl">(R. Yehoshua ben Levi):</span> If one sees the firmament b'Taharasah (without any obstruction), he blesses "Oseh Ma'aseh Bereishis."</p>
<p class="bas indent1"><span class="nm">(j)</span><span class="cl">Question:</span> When is considered seeing it b'Taharasah?</p>
<p class="bas indent1"><span class="nm">(k)</span><span class="cl">Answer #1 (Abaye):</span> This is when it rained all night, and in the morning wind removes the clouds.</p>
<p class="bas indent1"><span class="nm">(l)</span>This is unlike Rafram bar Papa said:</p>
<p class="bas indent2"><span class="nm">1.</span><span class="cl">(Rafram bar Papa):</span> From the time of the Churban, the firmament was not seen b'Taharasah -- "Albish Shamayim Kadrus v'Sak Asim Kesusam."</p>
<p class="bas bbbline">59b----------------------------------------59b</p>
<p class="bas indent1"><span class="nm">(m)</span><span class="cl">(Beraisa):</span> One blesses "Oseh Ma'aseh Bereishis" on the following:</p>
<p class="bas indent2"><span class="nm">1.</span>Seeing the sun in its Tekufah (in the same position in which it was created).</p>
<p class="bas indent2"><span class="nm">2.</span>Seeing the moon in its Gevurah (Rosh - in its Taharah), the stars and constellations in their paths.</p>
<p class="bas indent1"><span class="nm">(n)</span><span class="cl">Question:</span> When is the sun in its Tekufah?</p>
<p class="bas indent1"><span class="nm">(o)</span><span class="cl">Answer (Abaye):</span> This occurs once every 28 years, on the fourth night of the week, when Shabtai (Saturn) is first to dominate at night.</p>
<p class="bas indent1"><span class="nm">(p)</span>(The five closest planets, sun, and moon are called "Kochvei Lechet," and at any time one of them dominates, according to a fixed rotation.)</p>
<p class="bas subject"><span class="nm">5)</span>BLESSINGS FOR BODIES OF WATER</p>
<p class="bas indent1"><span class="nm">(a)</span><span class="cl">(Mishnah - R. Yehudah):</span> If one sees the Yam ha'Gadol [sporadically]...</p>
<p class="bas indent1"><span class="nm">(b)</span><span class="cl">Question:</span> What is considered sporadically?</p>
<p class="bas indent1"><span class="nm">(c)</span><span class="cl">Answer (Rami bar Aba):</span> This is [at least] 30 days [since he last saw it].</p>
<p class="bas indent1"><span class="nm">(d)</span><span class="cl">(Rami bar Aba):</span> If one sees the Pras (Euphrates) River at the bridge of Bavel or above, he blesses "Oseh Ma'aseh Bereishis" (there, it flows its natural course, while below the bridge, people rerouted it);</p>
<p class="bas indent1"><span class="nm">(e)</span>Now that the Persians rerouted it (above the bridge, until Bei Shavor), one may bless only above Bei Shavor;</p>
<p class="bas indent1"><span class="nm">(f)</span><span class="cl">(Rav Yosef):</span> One may bless only above Ihi Dekira.</p>
<p class="bas indent1"><span class="nm">(g)</span><span class="cl">(Rami bar Aba):</span> If one sees the Diglas (Chidekel) River at the Shevistena bridge [or above], he blesses "Oseh Ma'aseh Bereishis";</p>
<p class="bas indent1"><span class="nm">(h)</span><span class="cl">Question:</span> Why is it called "Chidekel"?</p>
<p class="bas indent1"><span class="nm">(i)</span><span class="cl">Answer (Rav Ashi):</span> Its water is Chad (sharp) and Kal (Rashi - light; Maharsha - makes a Kol (noise)).</p>
<p class="bas indent1"><span class="nm">(j)</span><span class="cl">Question:</span> What is the meaning of the name "Pras"?</p>
<p class="bas indent1"><span class="nm">(k)</span><span class="cl">Answer:</span> Its waters increase (the river widens) and make things grow.</p>
<p class="bas indent1"><span class="nm">(l)</span><span class="cl">(Rava):</span> People of Mechuza (my city) are Charif (sharp) because they drink water of the Diglas;</p>
<p class="bas indent2"><span class="nm">1.</span>They are red because they have relations during the day (this causes the children to be red);</p>
<p class="bas indent2"><span class="nm">2.</span>Their eyes move around because they dwell in dark houses.</p>
<p class="bas subject"><span class="nm">6)</span>THE BLESSING OF <i>HA'TOV VEHA'METIV</i></p>
<p class="bas indent1"><span class="nm">(a)</span><span class="cl">(Mishnah):</span> On rain [one blesses ha'Tov veha'Metiv].</p>
<p class="bas indent1"><span class="nm">(b)</span><span class="cl">Question:</span> We say a different blessing!</p>
<p class="bas indent2"><span class="nm">1.</span><span class="cl">(R. Avahu):</span> We bless on rain when "the Chasan goes to meet the Kalah" (most Rishonim - the rain makes many bubbles in puddles, the bubbles collide; Rashi - there are puddles on the ground, when a raindrop falls in one, the drop below rises to greet it);</p>
<p class="bas indent2"><span class="nm">2.</span><span class="cl">Question:</span> What blessing do we make?</p>
<p class="bas indent2"><span class="nm">3.</span><span class="cl">Answer (Rav Yehudah):</span> "We thank You for every drop...."</p>
<p class="bas indent2"><span class="nm">4.</span><span class="cl">(R. Yochanan):</span> We conclude, ''If our mouths were full of song like the sea... we could not thank You [for a tiny fraction of Your good deeds]... Baruch Atah Hash-m <i>Rov</i> ha'Hoda'os."</p>
<p class="bas indent2"><span class="nm">5.</span><span class="cl">Question:</span> Are only <i>most</i> thanks due to Him, and not all?!</p>
<p class="bas indent2"><span class="nm">6.</span><span class="cl">Correction (Rava):</span> Rather, we say, "ha'Kel ha'Hoda'os."</p>
<p class="bas indent2"><span class="nm">7.</span><span class="cl">Version #1 (our text, most Rishonim) (Rav Papa):</span> Therefore, we say both -- "Rov ha'Hoda'os veha'Kel ha'Hoda'os."</p>
<p class="bas indent2"><span class="nm">8.</span><span class="cl">Version #2 (Ba'al ha'Me'or) (Rav Papa):</span> Therefore, we say both texts (of Rav Yehudah and R. Yochanan). (End of Version #2)</p>
<p class="bas indent2"><span class="nm">9.</span>Question (b) remains!</p>
<p class="bas indent1"><span class="nm">(c)</span><span class="cl">Answer #1:</span> If one hears that rain fell, he blesses ha'Tov veha'Metiv; if he saw it, he blesses, "We thank You for every drop...."</p>
<p class="bas indent1"><span class="nm">(d)</span><span class="cl">Objection:</span> Hearing about rain is good tidings -- the Mishnah explicitly teaches good tidings (surely, rain is a different case)!</p>
<p class="bas indent1"><span class="nm">(e)</span><span class="cl">Answer #2:</span> In both cases, he saw it;</p>
<p class="bas indent2"><span class="nm">1.</span>If much rain fell, he blesses ha'Tov veha'Metiv; if only a little fell, he says, "We thank You...."</p>
<p class="bas indent1"><span class="nm">(f)</span><span class="cl">Answer #3:</span> In both cases, much rain fell;</p>
<p class="bas indent2"><span class="nm">1.</span>If he owns land he blesses ha'Tov veha'Metiv (Hash-m did good to him), if not, "We thank You...."</p>
<p class="bas indent1"><span class="nm">(g)</span><span class="cl">Question (Beraisa):</span> If one built a new house or bought new vessels, he blesses Shehecheyanu;</p>
<p class="bas indent2"><span class="nm">1.</span>(If they are for him and for others, he blesses ha'Tov veha'Metiv - Gra deletes this.)</p>
<p class="bas indent1"><span class="nm">(h)</span><span class="cl">Answer:</span> He blesses ha'Tov veha'Metiv only if he has a partner [who shares the benefit].</p>
<p class="bas indent1"><span class="nm">(i)</span><span class="cl">Support (Beraisa):</span> The rule is -- if it is [only] his, he blesses Shehecheyanu; if it belongs to him and someone else, he blesses ha'Tov veha'Metiv.</p>
<p class="bas indent1"><span class="nm">(j)</span><span class="cl">Question:</span> Sometimes one says ha'Tov veha'Metiv even if he has no partner!</p>
<p class="bas indent2"><span class="nm">1.</span><span class="cl">(Beraisa):</span> If a man was told that his wife gave birth to a boy, he blesses ha'Tov veha'Metiv.</p>

<p class="bas indent1"><span class="nm">(n)</span><span class="cl">Question (Beraisa):</span> If one [was drinking wine and] changed his place, he must bless again [in the new place]; if he changed wines, he does not bless on the new wine;</p>
