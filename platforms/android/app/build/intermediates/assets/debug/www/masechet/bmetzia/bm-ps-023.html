<p class="bas subject"><span class="nm">1)</span>A <i>SIMAN</i> THAT WILL NOT LAST (cont.)</p>
<p class="bas indent1"><span class="nm">(a)</span><span class="cl">Question (against Rabah - Mishnah):</span> Baker's loaves (the finder keeps them).</p>
<p class="bas indent2"><span class="nm">1.</span><span class="cl">Inference:</span> Loaves of a common person must be announced!</p>
<p class="bas indent2"><span class="nm">2.</span>People have particular ways of making loaves, this is a Siman. The Mishnah's law applies even in the Reshus ha'Rabim, where they will be trampled!</p>
<p class="bas indent1"><span class="nm">(b)</span><span class="cl">Answer:</span> They will not be trampled, because it is forbidden to trample on food.</p>
<p class="bas indent1"><span class="nm">(c)</span><span class="cl">Question:</span> Also Nochrim walk there. They will trample on them!</p>
<p class="bas indent1"><span class="nm">(d)</span><span class="cl">Answer:</span> Nochrim will not trample on them, for they are concerned for witchcraft.</p>
<p class="bas indent1"><span class="nm">(e)</span><span class="cl">Question:</span> Animals and dogs walk there. They will trample on them!</p>
<p class="bas indent1"><span class="nm">(f)</span><span class="cl">Answer:</span> The Mishnah discusses a place where animals and dogs are uncommon.</p>
<p class="bas indent1"><span class="nm">(g)</span><span class="cl">Suggestion:</span> Tana'im argue as Rabah and Rava argue.</p>
<p class="bas indent2"><span class="nm">1.</span><span class="cl">(Mishnah - R. Yehudah):</span> One must announce anything unusual, such as pottery in a ring of figs, or coins in a loaf.</p>
<p class="bas indent2"><span class="nm">2.</span><span class="cl">Inference:</span> The first Tana holds that the finder keeps them!</p>
<p class="bas indent2"><span class="nm">3.</span>We are thinking that all agree that a Siman that comes by itself is a (valid) Siman, and one may trample on food.)</p>
<p class="bas indent2"><span class="nm">4.</span><span class="cl">Version #1- Suggestion:</span> The first Tana holds that a Siman that will be trampled on is not a Siman, and R. Yehudah holds that it is a Siman! (Shitah Mekubetzes - R. Yehudah mentioned a Shinuy, for only Simanim that came by themselves are lost through trampling.)</p>
<p class="bas indent1"><span class="nm">(h)</span><span class="cl">Rejection #1 (Rav Zvid citing Rava):</span> If the first Tana held that a Siman that will be trampled on is not a Siman, and one may trample on food, he would not obligate announcing loaves (not of a baker) in the Reshus ha'Rabim!</p>
<p class="bas indent2"><span class="nm">1.</span>Rather, both Tana'im hold that a Siman that will be trampled on is a Siman, and one may trample on food;</p>
<p class="bas indent2"><span class="nm">2.</span>They argue about whether or not a Siman that comes by itself is a Siman. The first Tana holds that it is not, R. Yehudah holds that it is.</p>
<p class="bas indent1"><span class="nm">(i)</span><span class="cl">Rejection #2 (on behalf of Rabah):</span> Both Tana'im hold that a Siman that will be trampled on is not a Siman, and one may not trample on food;</p>
<p class="bas indent2"><span class="nm">1.</span>They argue about whether or not a Siman that comes by itself is a Siman (like above).</p>
<p class="bas indent1"><span class="nm">(j)</span><span class="cl">Version #2:</span> Both Tana'im hold that a Siman that comes by itself is a Siman, and a Siman that will be trampled on is not a Siman.</p>
<p class="bas indent1"><span class="nm">(k)</span><span class="cl">Suggestion:</span> They argue about whether or not one may trample on food. The first Tana permits, and R. Yehudah forbids.</p>
<p class="bas indent1"><span class="nm">(l)</span><span class="cl">Rejection #1 (Rav Zvid citing Rava):</span> If the first Tana held that a Siman that will be trampled on is not a Siman, and one may trample on food, he would not obligate announcing loaves (not of a baker) in the Reshus ha'Rabim!</p>
<p class="bas indent2"><span class="nm">1.</span>Rather, both Tana'im hold that a Siman that will be trampled on is a Siman, and one may trample on food;</p>
<p class="bas indent2"><span class="nm">2.</span>They argue about whether or not a Siman that comes by itself is a Siman.</p>
<p class="bas indent1"><span class="nm">(m)</span><span class="cl">Rejection #2 (on behalf of Rabah):</span> Both Tana'im hold that a Siman that will be trampled on is not a Siman, and one may not trample on food;</p>
<p class="bas indent2"><span class="nm">1.</span>They argue about whether or not a Siman that comes by itself is a Siman.</p>
<p class="bas indent1"><span class="nm">(n)</span><span class="cl">(Rav Zvid):</span> The general rule of Aveidos is, when the owner says 'woe for my loss of money', that is despair.</p>
<p class="bas indent1"><span class="nm">(o)</span><span class="cl">(Rav Zvid):</span> The Halachah is, if one finds small bundles of sheaves in the Reshus ha'Rabim, the Siman will be trampled (so he keeps them);</p>
<p class="bas indent1"><span class="nm">(p)</span>In a Reshus ha'Yachid, if it looks like they fell, he keeps them. If it looks like they were placed down, he takes and announces them.</p>
<p class="bas indent2"><span class="nm">1.</span>Both of these are when they have no Siman. If they have a Siman, whether in a Reshus ha'Yachid or Reshus ha'Rabim, whether they fell or were placed, he announces them.</p>

<p class="bas subject"><span class="nm">2)</span>OTHER TYPES OF <i>SIMANIM</i></p>
<p class="bas indent1"><span class="nm">(a)</span><span class="cl">(Mishnah):</span> (The finder keeps) fish on a string.</p>
<p class="bas indent1"><span class="nm">(b)</span><span class="cl">Version #1 (Rosh) Question:</span> Why does he keep them? The way they are tied should be a Siman!</p>
<p class="bas indent1"><span class="nm">(c)</span><span class="cl">Answer:</span> All fishermen tie them this way.</p>
<p class="bas indent1"><span class="nm">(d)</span><span class="cl">Version #2 (Ramban):</span> Since we do not say that the way he tied them is a Siman, it must be, this is not considered a Siman!</p>
<p class="bas indent1"><span class="nm">(e)</span><span class="cl">Rejection:</span> The case is, they are tied like all fishermen tie them. (end of Version #2)</p>
<p class="bas indent1"><span class="nm">(f)</span><span class="cl">Question:</span> The number of fish is a Siman!</p>
<p class="bas indent1"><span class="nm">(g)</span><span class="cl">Answer:</span> There are as many as fishermen normally put on a string.</p>
<p class="bas indent1"><span class="nm">(h)</span><span class="cl">Question:</span> Is the number found a Siman?</p>
<p class="bas indent1"><span class="nm">(i)</span><span class="cl">Answer (Rav Sheshes - Beraisa):</span> If he found Kelim of silver or copper, or pieces of lead, or any metal Kelim, he returns them only to one who gives a Siman or their weight.</p>
<p class="bas indent2"><span class="nm">1.</span>Since weight is a Siman, also the measure or number is a Siman.</p>
<p class="bas indent1"><span class="nm">(j)</span><span class="cl">(Mishnah):</span> (The finder keeps) pieces of meat.</p>
<p class="bas indent1"><span class="nm">(k)</span><span class="cl">Question:</span> The weight should be a Siman!</p>
<p class="bas indent1"><span class="nm">(l)</span><span class="cl">Answer:</span> It is a standard weight that butchers sell.</p>
<p class="bas indent1"><span class="nm">(m)</span><span class="cl">Question:</span> The limb should be a Siman, e.g. the flanks or thigh!</p>
<p class="bas indent2"><span class="nm">1.</span><span class="cl">(Beraisa):</span> If one finds pieces of fish or a bitten fish, he must announce it;</p>
<p class="bas indent2"><span class="nm">2.</span>If one found barrels of wine, oil, grain, figs or olives, he keeps them.</p>
<p class="bas indent1"><span class="nm">(n)</span><span class="cl">Answer:</span> In the Beraisa, the pieces are cut in a special way. <i>This</i> is a Siman.</p>
<p class="bas indent2"><span class="nm">1.</span>Rabah bar Rav Huna used to cut triangular pieces of meat (to ensure that a Nochri not switch it with other meat).</p>
<p class="bas indent1"><span class="nm">(o)</span><span class="cl">Support:</span> Presumably, the pieces of fish are similar to a bitten fish (taught with it), which is (very rare, and hence) a (superb) Siman.</p>
<p class="bas subject"><span class="nm">3)</span><i>SIMANIM</i> ON BARRELS</p>
<p class="bas indent1"><span class="nm">(a)</span><span class="cl">(Beraisa):</span> If one found barrels of wine, oil, grain, figs or olives, he keeps them.</p>
<p class="bas indent1"><span class="nm">(b)</span><span class="cl">Contradiction (Mishnah):</span> If one found barrels of wine or oil, he must announce them.</p>
<p class="bas indent1"><span class="nm">(c)</span><span class="cl">Answer (R. Zeira):</span> The Mishnah discusses barrels that were (opened and re)sealed. This is a Siman.</p>
<p class="bas indent1"><span class="nm">(d)</span><span class="cl">Question:</span> If the Beraisa discusses open barrels, (one may not drink them, for) snakes can drink from them. The owner willingly forfeited them!</p>
<p class="bas indent1"><span class="nm">(e)</span><span class="cl">Answer #1 (R. Hoshaya):</span> They are covered, but not plastered closed (this is not a Siman).</p>
<p class="bas indent1"><span class="nm">(f)</span><span class="cl">Answer #2 (Abaye):</span> Also in the Beraisa they are resealed;</p>
<p class="bas indent2"><span class="nm">1.</span>The Mishnah discusses before the season to sell wine came. It is rare to reseal a barrel then, so this is a Siman;</p>
<p class="bas indent2"><span class="nm">2.</span>The Beraisa discusses after the season came. It is common to reseal barrels then, so it is not a Siman.</p>
<p class="bas indent2"><span class="nm">3.</span>Rav Yakov bar Aba found a resealed barrel after the season came. Abaye ruled that he may keep it.</p>
<p class="bas indent1"><span class="nm">(g)</span><span class="cl">Question (Rav Bivi):</span> Is the place (where it was left) a Siman?</p>
<p class="bas indent1"><span class="nm">(h)</span><span class="cl">Answer (Rav Nachman - Beraisa):</span> If one found barrels of wine, oil, grain, figs or olives, he keeps them;</p>
<p class="bas indent2"><span class="nm">1.</span>If the place were a Siman, he should announce where they were found!</p>
<p class="bas indent1"><span class="nm">(i)</span><span class="cl">Rejection (Rav Zvid):</span> The case is, it was left at the dock where ships unload.</p>
<p class="bas indent1"><span class="nm">(j)</span><span class="cl">Version #1 - Question (Rav Mari):</span> Why isn't it a Siman that he lost it at the docks?</p>
<p class="bas indent1"><span class="nm">(k)</span><span class="cl">Answer (Rav Mari):</span> Just like he forgot a barrel there, others also forgot barrels.</p>
<p class="bas indent1"><span class="nm">(l)</span><span class="cl">Version #2 - Question (Rav Mari):</span> (In general,) why isn't the place a Siman?</p>
<p class="bas indent1"><span class="nm">(m)</span><span class="cl">Answer (Rav Mari):</span> Just like he forgot a barrel there, others also forgot barrels. (end of Version #2)</p>
<p class="bas indent1"><span class="nm">(n)</span>Reuven found pitch regarding the olive-presses; Rav ruled that he may keep it. Rav saw that Reuven was hesitant; he told him to split it with Rav's son Chiya.</p>
<p class="bas indent1"><span class="nm">(o)</span><span class="cl">Suggestion:</span> This shows that Rav holds that place is not a Siman!</p>
<p class="bas indent1"><span class="nm">(p)</span><span class="cl">Rejection (R. Aba):</span> No, he permitted it because the owner surely despaired. Nettles (a kind of mold) were growing on it.</p>
<p class="bas subject"><span class="nm">4)</span>NEW <i>KELIM</i></p>
<p class="bas indent1"><span class="nm">(a)</span><span class="cl">(Mishnah - R. Shimon ben Elazar):</span> One need not announce Anpurya Kelim.</p>
<p class="bas indent1"><span class="nm">(b)</span><span class="cl">Question:</span> What is Anpurya?</p>
<p class="bas indent1"><span class="nm">(c)</span><span class="cl">Answer (Rav Yehudah):</span> It is new Kelim that one does not yet recognize well.</p>
<p class="bas indent1"><span class="nm">(d)</span><span class="cl">Question:</span> What is the case?</p>
<p class="bas indent2"><span class="nm">1.</span>If they have a Siman, even if one does not yet recognize them, they must be returned!</p>
<p class="bas indent2"><span class="nm">2.</span>If they have no Siman, even if one recognizes them, they need not be announced!</p>
<p class="bas indent1"><span class="nm">(e)</span><span class="cl">Answer:</span> Really, he has no Siman;</p>
<p class="bas indent2"><span class="nm">1.</span>If one does not yet recognize them, we are not concerned to announce it in case a Chacham recognizes it.</p>
