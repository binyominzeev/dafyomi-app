<p class="bas subject"><span class="nm">1)</span>FALSE VOWS</p>
<p class="bas indent1"><span class="nm">(a)</span><span class="cl">(Mishnah):</span> One may falsely vow to murderers, looters and tax-collectors, to convince them that it (what they want to take) is Terumah, or belongs to the king;</p>
<p class="bas indent1"><span class="nm">(b)</span>Beis Shamai say, one may falsely vow, but not swear;</p>
<p class="bas indent1"><span class="nm">(c)</span>Beis Hillel say, one may even swear.</p>
<p class="bas indent1"><span class="nm">(d)</span>Beis Shamai say, one may not be Pose'ach (initiate) a vow (if the thug did not request this);</p>
<p class="bas indent1"><span class="nm">(e)</span>Beis Hillel say, he may initiate a vow.</p>
<p class="bas indent1"><span class="nm">(f)</span>Beis Shamai say, one may vow only like he was requested;</p>
<p class="bas indent1"><span class="nm">(g)</span>Beis Hillel say, one may add to the vow;</p>
<p class="bas indent1"><span class="nm">(h)</span>If the robber asked Reuven to vow 'if I am lying, my wife may not benefit from me', and Reuven vowed 'if I am lying, my wife and children are forbidden':</p>
<p class="bas indent2"><span class="nm">1.</span>Beis Shamai say, his wife is permitted, and his children are forbidden;</p>
<p class="bas indent2"><span class="nm">2.</span>Beis Hillel say, both are permitted.</p>
<p class="bas indent1"><span class="nm">(i)</span><span class="cl">(Gemara) Question:</span> (Why may one lie to tax collectors?) Shmuel taught that the laws of the country must be followed!</p>
<p class="bas indent1"><span class="nm">(j)</span><span class="cl">Answer #1 (Rav Chinena citing Shmuel):</span> The tax collector in the Mishnah takes as much as he wants.</p>
<p class="bas indent1"><span class="nm">(k)</span><span class="cl">Answer #2 (d'Vei R. Yanai):</span> The tax collector was self-appointed (i.e. not by the king).</p>
<p class="bas subject"><span class="nm">2)</span>WHICH VOWS MAY ONE TAKE?</p>
<p class="bas indent1"><span class="nm">(a)</span><span class="cl">(Mishnah):</span> One may falsely vow that the property belongs to the king.</p>
<p class="bas indent1"><span class="nm">(b)</span><span class="cl">Question:</span> What vow does he say?</p>
<p class="bas indent1"><span class="nm">(c)</span><span class="cl">Answer (Rav Amram):</span> He says '(all) Peiros are forbidden to me if this is not the king's'.</p>
<p class="bas indent1"><span class="nm">(d)</span><span class="cl">Question:</span> If so, they indeed become forbidden to him!</p>
<p class="bas indent1"><span class="nm">(e)</span><span class="cl">Answer:</span> He says, '(all) Peiros are forbidden to me today if this is not the king's'.</p>
<p class="bas indent1"><span class="nm">(f)</span><span class="cl">Objection:</span> The tax collector will not accept such a vow!</p>
<p class="bas indent1"><span class="nm">(g)</span><span class="cl">Answer:</span> He says 'today' only in his heart, not with his lips.</p>
<p class="bas indent2"><span class="nm">1.</span>Even though unspoken conditions are ignored, in the case of Ones they are valid.</p>
<p class="bas indent1"><span class="nm">(h)</span><span class="cl">(Mishnah - Beis Shamai):</span> One may vow (but not swear)... only as requested. Beis Hillel permit adding to the vow;</p>
<p class="bas indent2"><span class="nm">1.</span>Beis Shamai say, if he asked Reuven to vow 'If I am lying, my wife is forbidden to benefit from me', and Reuven vowed 'If I am lying, my wife and children are forbidden', his wife is permitted, his children are forbidden;</p>
<p class="bas indent2"><span class="nm">2.</span>Beis Hillel say, both are permitted.</p>
<p class="bas indent1"><span class="nm">(i)</span><span class="cl">(Beraisa - Beis Shamai):</span> One may not be Pose'ach (initiate) an oath;</p>
<p class="bas indent1"><span class="nm">(j)</span>Beis Hillel permit.</p>
<p class="bas indent1"><span class="nm">(k)</span><span class="cl">Question #1 - Inference:</span> Beis Shamai forbid initiating an oath, but one may initiate a vow!</p>
<p class="bas indent2"><span class="nm">1.</span>In the Mishnah, Beis Shamai forbid this!</p>
<p class="bas indent1"><span class="nm">(l)</span><span class="cl">Question #2 - Inference:</span> Beis Shamai forbid initiating an oath, but one may swear if requested!</p>
<p class="bas indent2"><span class="nm">1.</span>In the Mishnah, Beis Shamai forbid this!</p>
<p class="bas indent1"><span class="nm">(m)</span><span class="cl">Answer #1 (to both questions):</span> The Tana of the Mishnah taught the argument regarding (initiating) a vow, to show how stringent Beis Shamai are. The Tana of the Beraisa taught the argument regarding (initiating) an oath, to show how lenient Beis Hillel are.</p>
<p class="bas indent1"><span class="nm">(n)</span><span class="cl">Answer #2 (Rav Ashi):</span> (The Beraisa does not discuss swearing to thugs.) Beis Shamai say that we do not Pose'ach (suggest grounds to permit) oaths. Beis Hillel say that we do.</p>
<p class="bas subject"><span class="nm">3)</span>IRREDEEMABLE <i>HEKDESH</i></p>
<p class="bas indent1"><span class="nm">(a)</span><span class="cl">(Mishnah):</span> If one said 'these saplings will be Hekdesh if they are not uprooted' or 'this Talis will be Hekdesh if it is not burned', they can be redeemed;</p>
<p class="bas indent1"><span class="nm">(b)</span>If he said 'these saplings are Hekdesh until they are uprooted' or 'this Talis is Hekdesh until it is burned', they cannot be redeemed.</p>
<p class="bas bbbline">28b----------------------------------------28b</p>
<p class="bas indent1"><span class="nm">(c)</span><span class="cl">(Gemara) Question:</span> The Mishnah should say whether or not they are Hekdesh (and not whether or not they can be redeemed)!</p>
<p class="bas indent1"><span class="nm">(d)</span><span class="cl">Answer:</span> Since the Seifa must teach 'they cannot be redeemed', the Reisha says 'they can be redeemed'.</p>
<p class="bas indent1"><span class="nm">(e)</span><span class="cl">Question:</span> What was his vow?</p>
<p class="bas indent1"><span class="nm">(f)</span><span class="cl">Answer (Ameimar):</span> He said '...if they are not uprooted today', and they were not uprooted that day.</p>
<p class="bas indent1"><span class="nm">(g)</span><span class="cl">Objection:</span> If so, obviously they are Hekdesh!</p>
<p class="bas indent1"><span class="nm">(h)</span><span class="cl">Answer:</span> The case is, there was a strong wind (and they were likely to be uprooted).</p>
<p class="bas indent1"><span class="nm">(i)</span><span class="cl">Objection:</span> Can we say that a Talis was likely to be burned?!</p>
<p class="bas indent1"><span class="nm">(j)</span><span class="cl">Answer:</span> Yes! The case is, there is a fire.</p>
<p class="bas indent2"><span class="nm">1.</span>One might have thought that he vows only because he thinks they will not be saved.</p>
<p class="bas indent2"><span class="nm">2.</span>The verse teaches that this is not so. He wants to make them Hekdesh if they are saved.</p>
<p class="bas indent1"><span class="nm">(k)</span><span class="cl">(Mishnah):</span> These saplings are Hekdesh...</p>
<p class="bas indent1"><span class="nm">(l)</span><span class="cl">Question:</span> Are they always Hekdesh? (Why can't they be redeemed?)</p>
<p class="bas indent1"><span class="nm">(m)</span><span class="cl">Answer #1 (Bar Pada):</span> The Mishnah teaches that no matter how many times they are redeemed before they are uprooted, they become Hekdesh again;</p>
<p class="bas indent2"><span class="nm">1.</span>Once they are uprooted, if they are redeemed, they become Chulin.</p>
<p class="bas indent1"><span class="nm">(n)</span><span class="cl">Answer #2 (Ula):</span> Once they are cut, there is no need to redeem them (they are automatically Chulin).</p>
