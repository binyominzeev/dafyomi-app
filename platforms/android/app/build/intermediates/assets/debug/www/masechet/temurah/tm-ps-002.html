<p class="bas indent1"><span class="nm">(a)</span>(If an animal was designated to be a Korban, and the owner says "this (Chulin) animal is in place of this (Korban), he transgresses the prohibition of Temurah. The Korban is unaffected, and (in most cases) the Chulin animal receives the Kedushah of the Korban.)</p>
<p class="bas indent1"><span class="nm">(b)</span><span class="cl">(Mishnah):</span> Everyone can make Temurah, both men and women;</p>
<p class="bas indent2"><span class="nm">1.</span>This does not mean that it is permitted. Rather, if one made Temurah, it takes effect, and he receives 40 lashes.</p>
<p class="bas indent1"><span class="nm">(c)</span><span class="cl">(Gemara) Question:</span> The Mishnah contradicts itself!</p>
<p class="bas indent2"><span class="nm">1.</span>First it says that anyone can make Temurah. This implies that this is l'Chatchilah;</p>
<p class="bas indent2"><span class="nm">2.</span>Then it says that it is not permitted!</p>
<p class="bas indent2"><span class="nm">3.</span><span class="cl">Counter-question:</span> If you think that "everyone can make Temurah" connotes l'Chatchilah, why did you ask from the Seifa? You should have asked from a verse (which forbids), "Lo Yachalifenu v'Lo Yamir Oso"!</p>
<p class="bas indent1"><span class="nm">(d)</span><span class="cl">Answer (Rav Yehudah):</span> The Mishnah means that everyone has the ability to be Mekadesh an animal through Temurah, men and women;</p>
<p class="bas indent2"><span class="nm">1.</span>This does not mean that it is permitted. Rather, if anyone made Temurah, it takes effect, and he receives 40 lashes.</p>
<p class="bas indent1"><span class="nm">(e)</span><span class="cl">Question:</span> The Mishnah says "everyone". Whom does this come to include?</p>
<p class="bas indent1"><span class="nm">(f)</span><span class="cl">Answer:</span> It includes an heir (who inherited a Korban). The Mishnah is unlike R. Yehudah:</p>
<p class="bas indent2"><span class="nm">1.</span><span class="cl">(Beraisa - R. Meir):</span> An heir does Semichah (leans on the Korban's head before Shechitah). An heir can make Temurah;</p>
<p class="bas indent2"><span class="nm">2.</span>R. Yehudah says, an heir does not do Semichah, he cannot make Temurah.</p>
<p class="bas indent2"><span class="nm">3.</span><span class="cl">Question:</span> What is R. Yehudah's reason?</p>
<p class="bas indent2"><span class="nm">4.</span><span class="cl">Answer:</span> He learns Techilas Hekdesh (Temurah, which makes Hekdesh) from Sof Hekdesh (Semichah, which is just before Shechitah);</p>
<p class="bas indent3"><span class="nm">i.</span>Just like an heir does not do Semichah, he cannot make Temurah.</p>
<p class="bas indent2"><span class="nm">5.</span><span class="cl">Question:</span> What is his source that an heir does not do Semichah?</p>
<p class="bas indent2"><span class="nm">6.</span><span class="cl">Answer:</span> It says three times "Korbano," to exclude (Semichah on) the Korban of a Nochri, of another Yisrael, and of one's father.</p>
<p class="bas indent2"><span class="nm">7.</span><span class="cl">Question:</span> Why does R. Meir say that an heir can do Semichah?</p>
<p class="bas indent2"><span class="nm">8.</span><span class="cl">Answer:</span> He uses the third "Korbano" to teach that every partner on a Korban does Semichah;</p>
<p class="bas indent2"><span class="nm">9.</span>R. Yehudah disagrees with this. (Rashi - he exempts a jointly owned Korban from Semichah. Rashi in Erchin - one partner does Semichah for all of them.)</p>
<p class="bas indent2"><span class="nm">10.</span><span class="cl">Question:</span> What is the reason?</p>
<p class="bas indent2"><span class="nm">11.</span><span class="cl">Answer #1:</span> The Korban does not belong exclusively to any one of them. (It is not called "Korbano").</p>
<p class="bas indent2"><span class="nm">12.</span><span class="cl">Answer #2:</span> Alternatively, R. Yehudah could agree that every partner does Semichah;</p>
<p class="bas indent3"><span class="nm">i.</span>One "Korbano" excludes Semichah on the Korban of someone else, be it a Yisrael or Nochri, and one requires all partners to do Semichah. (One excludes an heir. We cannot learn from the first "Korbano," for sometimes an heir is considered to be just like the deceased.)</p>
<p class="bas indent1"><span class="nm">(g)</span><span class="cl">Question:</span> What is R. Meir's source that an heir can make Temurah?</p>
<p class="bas indent1"><span class="nm">(h)</span><span class="cl">Answer:</span> He learns from "v'Im Hamer Yamir" (the extra word includes an heir);</p>
<p class="bas bbbline">2b----------------------------------------2b</p>
<p class="bas indent2"><span class="nm">1.</span>He learns Sof Hekdesh (Semichah) from Techilas Hekdesh (Temurah). Just like an heir can make Temurah, he can do Semichah.</p>
<p class="bas indent1"><span class="nm">(i)</span><span class="cl">Question:</span> What does R. Yehudah learn from "v'Im Hamer Yamir"?</p>
<p class="bas indent1"><span class="nm">(j)</span><span class="cl">Answer:</span> It teaches that a woman can make Temurah;</p>
<p class="bas indent2"><span class="nm">1.</span><span class="cl">(Beraisa) Suggestion:</span> Perhaps a woman cannot make Temurah, because the entire Parshah is written in the masculine (e.g. "Lo <i>Y</i>achalifenu v'Lo <i>Y</i>amir " (he will not switch), as opposed to "Lo <i>T</i>achalifenu v'Lo <i>T</i>amir," which could mean you will not switch <i>or</i> she will not switch)!</p>
<p class="bas indent2"><span class="nm">2.</span><span class="cl">Rejection:</span> "V'Im Hamer Yamir" teaches that a woman can make Temurah.</p>
<p class="bas indent1"><span class="nm">(k)</span><span class="cl">Question:</span> What is R. Meir's source that a woman can make Temurah?</p>
<p class="bas indent1"><span class="nm">(l)</span><span class="cl">Answer:</span> He learns from the "Vav" in "v'Im Hamer Yamir";</p>
<p class="bas indent2"><span class="nm">1.</span>R. Yehudah does not expound the "Vav."</p>
<p class="bas indent1"><span class="nm">(m)</span><span class="cl">Question:</span> Why do R. Yehudah and R. Meir both need a verse to obligate a woman who makes Temurah? Rav Yehudah's teaching should obligate her!</p>
<p class="bas indent2"><span class="nm">1.</span><span class="cl">(Rav Yehudah (and Tana d'Vei R. Yishmael)):</span> "Ish Oh Ishah Asher Ya'asu mi'Kol Chatos ha'Adam" equates men and women regarding all punishments.</p>
<p class="bas indent1"><span class="nm">(n)</span><span class="cl">Answer:</span> A verse is needed to teach about Temurah;</p>
<p class="bas indent2"><span class="nm">1.</span><span class="cl">Version #1 (our text):</span> One might have thought that men and women are equated regarding sins that apply to individuals and the Tzibur, but not Temurah;</p>
<p class="bas indent3"><span class="nm">i.</span><span class="cl">(Mishnah):</span> The Tzibur or partners cannot make Temurah.</p>
<p class="bas indent2"><span class="nm">2.</span><span class="cl">Version #2 (Rashi):</span> One might have thought that they are equated regarding a Lav she'Yesh Bo Ma'aseh (with an action), but not regarding a Lav she'Ein Bo Ma'aseh; (end of Version #2)</p>
<p class="bas indent3"><span class="nm">i.</span>One might have thought that a woman who makes Temurah is not lashed. The verse teaches that she is.</p>
<p class="bas subject"><span class="nm">2)</span>WHO CAN MAKE <i>TEMURAH</i>?</p>
<p class="bas indent1"><span class="nm">(a)</span><span class="cl">Question #1 (Rami bar Chama):</span> Can a minor make Temurah?</p>
<p class="bas indent2"><span class="nm">1.</span><span class="cl">Question:</span> What is the case? (Onas ha'Nedarim is the age at which we are concerned for a minor's vows. Rashi - it is a year before he can become an adult (with the appearance of two pubic hairs), i.e. 12, or 11 for a girl. Rambam - it is after 13/12 years for a boy/girl, before there are two hairs. If such a minor vowed (or was Makdish), we check whether he understands that vows are commitments to Hash-m. If he does, it takes effect.)</p>
<p class="bas indent3"><span class="nm">i.</span>If he is below Onas ha'Nedarim, since he cannot be Makdish, surely he cannot make Temurah!</p>
<p class="bas indent2"><span class="nm">2.</span><span class="cl">Answer:</span> The case is, he reached Onas ha'Nedarim;</p>
<p class="bas indent3"><span class="nm">i.</span><span class="cl">Question:</span> It says "Ish" (can be Makdish). What do we learn from "Ki Yafli Neder"?</p>
<p class="bas indent3"><span class="nm">ii.</span><span class="cl">Answer:</span> This teaches that Mufla Samuch l'Ish (a minor who reached Onas ha'Nedarim) can vow.</p>
<p class="bas indent2"><span class="nm">3.</span><span class="cl">Summation of question:</span> Do we say since he can be Makdish, he can make Temurah?</p>
<p class="bas indent3"><span class="nm">i.</span>Or, since he is not liable for sin, his Temurah does not take effect!</p>
<p class="bas indent1"><span class="nm">(b)</span><span class="cl">Question #2:</span> If you will say that a minor can make Temurah, for later he will (mature and) be liable for sin, can a Nochri make Temurah?</p>
<p class="bas indent2"><span class="nm">1.</span>Since he can be Makdish, he can make Temurah;</p>
<p class="bas indent3"><span class="nm">i.</span><span class="cl">(Beraisa) Question:</span> What do we learn from "Ish Ish (... Asher Yakriv)"?</p>
<p class="bas indent3"><span class="nm">ii.</span><span class="cl">Answer:</span> This teaches that Nochrim may offer Nedarim and Nedavos, like Yisrael.</p>
<p class="bas indent2"><span class="nm">2.</span>Or, since he will never be lashed (for Temurah), his Temurah is not Kodesh!</p>
<p class="bas indent1"><span class="nm">(c)</span><span class="cl">Answer #1 (Rava - Beraisa - R. Shimon):</span> The following apply to Kodshim of Nochrim:</p>
<p class="bas indent2"><span class="nm">1.</span>One may not benefit from them. One who benefited from them did not transgress Me'ilah;</p>
<p class="bas indent2"><span class="nm">2.</span>One is not liable for them for Pigul, Nosar or Tamei;</p>
<p class="bas indent2"><span class="nm">3.</span>They do not make Temurah;</p>
<p class="bas indent2"><span class="nm">4.</span><span class="cl">Version #1:</span> Nochrim may not bring Nesachim alone, but Nesachim must be brought with their Korbanos.</p>
<p class="bas indent2"><span class="nm">5.</span><span class="cl">Version #2:</span> Nochrim may not bring Nesachim, but Nesachim must be brought (e.g. by the Tzibur) with their Korbanos. (end of Version #2)</p>
<p class="bas indent2"><span class="nm">6.</span>R. Yosi is stringent concerning all of these.</p>
<p class="bas indent2"><span class="nm">7.</span>This applies to Kodshei Mizbe'ach, but Me'ilah applies to Kodshei Bedek ha'Bayis. (Rashi - R. Shimon says this; Ri - R. Yosi says this.)</p>
<p class="bas indent2"><span class="nm">8.</span><span class="cl">Summation of answer:</span> It says that Kodshei Nochrim do not make Temurah!</p>
<p class="bas indent1"><span class="nm">(d)</span><span class="cl">Clarification:</span> Rami bar Chama did not ask about a Korban that a Nochri was Makdish for himself, rather, for a Korban that he was Makdish to atone for a Yisrael;</p>
<p class="bas indent2"><span class="nm">1.</span>If Temurah depends on the Makdish, it should not apply. If it depends on the Miskaper (the one for whom the Korban atones), it should apply.</p>
<p class="bas indent1"><span class="nm">(e)</span><span class="cl">Answer #2:</span> The following shows that Temurah depends on the Miskaper!</p>
<p class="bas indent2"><span class="nm">1.</span><span class="cl">(R. Yochanan):</span> If the Makdish redeems his own Hekdesh, he adds a fifth;</p>
<p class="bas indent2"><span class="nm">2.</span>Only the Miskaper can make Temurah;</p>
<p class="bas indent2"><span class="nm">3.</span>If Reuven makes his produce Terumah to exempt Shimon's Tevel, Reuven has Tovas Hana'ah (he gives the Terumah to the Kohen of his choice).</p>
<p class="bas indent1"><span class="nm">(f)</span><span class="cl">Rejection:</span> No, R. Yochanan discusses when all parties to the Korban (including the Makdish) were Yisraelim;</p>
<p class="bas indent2"><span class="nm">1.</span>Rami's question is whether or not every party to the Korban, from beginning to end, must be able to make Temurah (i.e. a Yisrael).</p>
<p class="bas indent1"><span class="nm">(g)</span>Questions #1 and #2 are unsettled.</p>
