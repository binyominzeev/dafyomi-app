<p class="bas subject"><span class="nm">1)</span>SECONDARY <i>HEKDESH</i> (cont.)</p>
<p class="bas indent1"><span class="nm">(a)</span><span class="cl">Question (Rav Ashi):</span> Why does the Tana assume that a Tamei animal is always initial Hekdesh? Perhaps it is intermediate Hekdesh! (E.g. it was used to redeem Hekdesh, and later it will be redeemed, for it is not needed for Avodah in the Mikdash.)</p>
<p class="bas indent1"><span class="nm">(b)</span><span class="cl">Answer (Ravina):</span> He calls it initial Hekdesh because it cannot be final Hekdesh (something used for Avodah). This is why the Chomesh does not apply to it.</p>
<p class="bas indent1"><span class="nm">(c)</span><span class="cl">Question (Rav Acha mi'Difti):</span> When it is intermediate Hekdesh, there should be a Chomesh for it!</p>
<p class="bas indent1"><span class="nm">(d)</span><span class="cl">Answer (Ravina):</span> Intermediate Hekdesh is like final Hekdesh. Just like there is no Chomesh for the latter (it is not redeemed), also for the former.</p>
<p class="bas indent1"><span class="nm">(e)</span><span class="cl">Question (Mar Zutra brei d'Rav Mari):</span> Why do you compare intermediate Hekdesh to final Hekdesh, and not to initial Hekdesh?</p>
<p class="bas indent1"><span class="nm">(f)</span><span class="cl">Answer (Ravina):</span> It is preferable to learn Hatfasah (imbuing with Kedushah of existing Hekdesh) from Hatfasah, and not from initial Hekdesh.</p>
<p class="bas indent1"><span class="nm">(g)</span><span class="cl">Question (Mar Zutra):</span> Just the contrary! It is preferable to learn something that can be redeemed from something that can be redeemed, and not from final Hekdesh!</p>
<p class="bas indent1"><span class="nm">(h)</span><span class="cl">Answer:</span> Rava taught that "ha'Olah" refers to the first Olah (offered each day). Similarly, "ha'Teme'ah" refers to the first (Hekdesh)!</p>
<p class="bas indent1"><span class="nm">(i)</span><span class="cl">Support (for R. Yehoshua ben Levi - Beraisa):</span> If Reuven said 'this cow or garment is (Hekdesh) in place of this Hekdesh cow', it is redeemed, and Hekdesh has the upper hand (if the redemption is worth more than the Hekdesh, the redemption stands. If it is worth less than the Hekdesh, Reuven must give the difference to Hekdesh. Normally, saying this is Temurah, and both cows would be Kodesh. We must say that the first Kodesh cow was of Bedek ha'Bayis, or it had a Mum before it was made Hekdesh.)</p>
<p class="bas indent2"><span class="nm">1.</span>If he said 'this cow or garment should be like five Shekalim in place of (i.e. to redeem) this Hekdesh cow', even if it is not worth five Shekalim, it is redeemed (Rashi - and Hekdesh has the upper hand; Tosfos - here, he need not add anything, for he intended to redeem onto this cow or garment even if it is worth less than the Hekdesh);</p>
<p class="bas indent2"><span class="nm">2.</span>He adds a Chomesh when redeeming initial Hekdesh, not secondary Hekdesh.</p>
<p class="bas subject"><span class="nm">2)</span>THINGS DEPENDANT ON A <i>PERUTAH</i></p>
<p class="bas indent1"><span class="nm">(a)</span><span class="cl">(Mishnah):</span> The threshold of Ona'ah is four (Ma'os of) silver (per Sela); the oath of partial denial is only when the claim was at least two (Ma'os of) silver, and the admission was at least a Perutah;</p>
<p class="bas indent1"><span class="nm">(b)</span>A Perutah is the Shi'ur (required quantity) for five things: the admission; money to be Mekadesh a woman; benefit from Hekdesh to transgress Me'ilah; the value of a Metzi'ah that obligates the finder to announce it; and if one stole a Perutah and swore that he did not, he must return it, even if the owner is overseas.</p>
<p class="bas indent1"><span class="nm">(c)</span><span class="cl">(Gemara) Question:</span> A Mishnah (49b) already taught this. The threshold of Ona'ah is four Ma'os per Sela, a sixth of the purchase!</p>
<p class="bas indent1"><span class="nm">(d)</span><span class="cl">Answer:</span> The Chidush is the next case. The oath of partial denial requires a claim of two Ma'os and an admission of a Perutah.</p>
<p class="bas indent1"><span class="nm">(e)</span><span class="cl">Question:</span> Another Mishnah (Shevu'os 38b) explicitly teaches this!</p>
<p class="bas indent1"><span class="nm">(f)</span><span class="cl">Answer:</span> The Chidush is that a Perutah is the Shi'ur for five things.</p>
<p class="bas indent1"><span class="nm">(g)</span><span class="cl">(Mishnah):</span> A Perutah is the Shi'ur for five things...</p>
<p class="bas indent1"><span class="nm">(h)</span><span class="cl">Question:</span> It should also teach that the threshold of Ona'ah is a Perutah!</p>
<p class="bas indent1"><span class="nm">(i)</span><span class="cl">Answer (Rav Kahana):</span> The omission teaches that Ona'ah of Perutos is not Ona'ah (only Ona'ah of Isarim, silver coins).</p>
<p class="bas indent1"><span class="nm">(j)</span><span class="cl">(Levi):</span> Ona'ah applies to Perutos.</p>
<p class="bas subject"><span class="nm">3)</span>WHY SOME CASES WERE OMITTED</p>
<p class="bas indent1"><span class="nm">(a)</span><span class="cl">(Levi's Tosefta):</span> A Perutah is the Shi'ur for five things: Ona'ah; the admission; money to be Mekadesh a woman; theft; and a claim to obligate judges to judge the case.</p>
<p class="bas indent1"><span class="nm">(b)</span><span class="cl">Question:</span> Why didn't our Tana teach a claim to obligate judges to judge the case?</p>
<p class="bas indent1"><span class="nm">(c)</span><span class="cl">Answer:</span> He already taught theft.</p>
<p class="bas indent1"><span class="nm">(d)</span><span class="cl">Question:</span> Even so, he also taught a Metzi'ah. If so, he could also teach a claim to obligate judges to judge the case!</p>
<p class="bas indent1"><span class="nm">(e)</span><span class="cl">Answer:</span> Each of those had a Chidush:</p>
<p class="bas indent2"><span class="nm">1.</span>The Chidush of theft is that if one stole a Perutah and swore that he did not, he must return it, even if the owner is overseas;</p>
<p class="bas indent2"><span class="nm">2.</span>The Chidush of a Metzi'ah is that if it was worth a Perutah when he found it he must announce it, even if it declined in value to less than a Perutah.</p>
<p class="bas indent1"><span class="nm">(f)</span><span class="cl">Question:</span> Why didn't Levi teach a Metzi'ah?</p>
<p class="bas indent1"><span class="nm">(g)</span><span class="cl">Answer:</span> It is included in theft.</p>
<p class="bas indent1"><span class="nm">(h)</span><span class="cl">Question:</span> He taught theft and a claim to obligate judges to judge the case!</p>
<p class="bas indent1"><span class="nm">(i)</span><span class="cl">Answer:</span> That was needed to exclude the opinion of Rav Katina.</p>
<p class="bas indent2"><span class="nm">1.</span><span class="cl">(Rav Katina):</span> Beis Din must judge a case of less than a Perutah.</p>
<p class="bas indent1"><span class="nm">(j)</span><span class="cl">Question:</span> Why didn't Levi teach Me'ilah?</p>
<p class="bas indent1"><span class="nm">(k)</span><span class="cl">Answer:</span> He only lists Perutos of Chulin.</p>
<p class="bas indent1"><span class="nm">(l)</span><span class="cl">Question:</span> Our Tana lists Perutos of Hekdesh. Why did he omit Ma'aser?</p>
<p class="bas indent1"><span class="nm">(m)</span><span class="cl">Answer:</span> He rules according to the opinion that it can imbue Kedushah to a coin only if its Chomesh is worth a Perutah (i.e. the Ma'aser is worth four Perutos).</p>
<p class="bas indent1"><span class="nm">(n)</span><span class="cl">Question:</span> Why didn't he teach that the Chomesh of Ma'aser must be a Perutah (in order that the Ma'aser can put Kedushah on a coin)?</p>
<p class="bas indent1"><span class="nm">(o)</span><span class="cl">Answer:</span> He discusses only principal, not Chomeshim.</p>
<p class="bas indent1"><span class="nm">(p)</span><span class="cl">(Rav Katina):</span> Beis Din must judge a case of less than a Perutah.</p>
<p class="bas indent1"><span class="nm">(q)</span><span class="cl">Objection (Rava - Beraisa):</span> "Asher Chata Min ha'Kodesh Yeshalem" includes less than a Perutah. One must return it to Hekdesh.</p>
<p class="bas bbbline">55b----------------------------------------55b</p>
<p class="bas indent2"><span class="nm">1.</span>It must be returned to Hekdesh, but not to a commoner (so Beis Din would not judge the case)!</p>
<p class="bas indent1"><span class="nm">(r)</span><span class="cl">Correction (Rav Katina):</span> If Beis Din started judging a case of a Perutah, they must give a verdict, even if the claim changed and it is now less than a Perutah;</p>
<p class="bas indent2"><span class="nm">1.</span>The beginning of the case must be for a Perutah. The verdict need not be.</p>
<p class="bas subject"><span class="nm">4)</span>STRENGTHENING RABBINICAL ENACTMENTS</p>
<p class="bas indent1"><span class="nm">(a)</span>There are five cases in which one must add a Chomesh:</p>
<p class="bas indent2"><span class="nm">1.</span>If a Zar ate b'Shogeg Terumah, Terumas Ma'aser of (definite) Tevel or Demai, Chalah or Bikurim, he adds a Chomesh to what he ate and gives it to a Kohen;</p>
<p class="bas indent2"><span class="nm">2.</span>One who redeems his Reva'i fourth-year Peros or Ma'aser Sheni;</p>
<p class="bas indent2"><span class="nm">3.</span>One who redeems his Hekdesh;</p>
<p class="bas indent2"><span class="nm">4.</span>If one benefited b'Shogeg from a Perutah of Hekdesh, he adds a Chomesh when paying back Hekdesh;</p>
<p class="bas indent2"><span class="nm">5.</span>If one stole and swore falsely, when he admits his sin he adds a Chomesh to the theft.</p>
<p class="bas indent1"><span class="nm">(b)</span><span class="cl">(Gemara - Rava) Question (R. Elazar):</span> Why is there a Chomesh for Terumas Ma'aser of Demai? Did Chachamim really strengthen their enactment as Torah law?!</p>
<p class="bas indent1"><span class="nm">(c)</span><span class="cl">Answer (Shmuel):</span> The Tana is R. Meir, who holds that indeed Chachamim strengthened their enactments like Torah law.</p>
<p class="bas indent2"><span class="nm">1.</span><span class="cl">(Beraisa - R. Meir):</span> (It was enacted that a Shali'ach who brings a Get from Chutz la'Aretz must say 'it was written and signed in front of me.') If he did not say this and she remarried using this Get, she must leave her husband. Any children she had are Mamzerim;</p>
<p class="bas indent2"><span class="nm">2.</span>Chachamim say, the child are not Mamzerim;</p>
<p class="bas indent3"><span class="nm">i.</span>To make the Get valid, he gives it again in front of two witnesses and says 'it was written and signed in front of me.'</p>
<p class="bas indent2"><span class="nm">3.</span><span class="cl">Question:</span> Does R. Meir say that because he did not say 'it was written and signed in front of me', she must leave her husband and her children are Mamzerim?! (Mid'Oraisa, the Get is valid!)</p>
<p class="bas indent2"><span class="nm">4.</span><span class="cl">Answer:</span> Yes, he holds ;` this in general;</p>
<p class="bas indent3"><span class="nm">i.</span><span class="cl">(Rav Hamnuna):</span> R. Meir holds that if a woman remarried using a Get that deviates from Chachamim's enactment, she must leave her husband and the children are Mamzerim.</p>
<p class="bas indent1"><span class="nm">(d)</span><span class="cl">Question (Rav Sheshes - Mishnah #1 - R. Meir):</span> Regarding Ma'aser Sheni of Demai, one may redeem silver (coins) onto silver or copper, copper onto copper or food (even outside of Yerushalayim), and he may redeem the food again;</p>
<p class="bas indent2"><span class="nm">1.</span>Chachamim say, he must take the food to Yerushalayim.</p>
<p class="bas indent2"><span class="nm">2.</span><span class="cl">Question:</span> One may not redeem silver onto copper!</p>
<p class="bas indent3"><span class="nm">i.</span><span class="cl">(Mishnah #2):</span> If a Sela of Ma'aser was mixed with a Sela of Chulin, he brings a Sela's worth of coins and says that the Ma'aser is redeemed onto the coins. He then redeems the coins onto the better of the two Sela'im;</p>
<p class="bas indent3"><span class="nm">ii.</span>This is because one may redeem silver onto copper only in pressed circumstances. It should not be left that way.</p>
<p class="bas indent2"><span class="nm">3.</span><span class="cl">Summation of question:</span> We may redeem silver onto copper only in pressed circumstances. Mishnah #1 allows this l'Chatchilah for Demai!</p>
