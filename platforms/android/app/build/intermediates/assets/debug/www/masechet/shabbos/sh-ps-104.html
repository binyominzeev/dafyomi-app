<p class="bas subject"><span class="nm">1)</span>THE DUAL FORMS OF FIVE LETTERS</p>
<p class="bas indent1"><span class="nm">(a)</span><span class="cl">Rejection:</span> This is wrong! A final Mem is better than a regular Mem (for it was on the Luchos), therefore it may replace it - but the regular, inferior Mem may not be used in place of a final Mem.</p>
<p class="bas indent2"><span class="nm">1.</span><span class="cl">(Rav Chisda):</span> Two letters stood miraculously in the Luchos - [final] Mem and Samech (the interior was suspended, disconnected from the Luchos.</p>
<p class="bas indent2"><span class="nm">2.</span><span class="cl">(R. Yirmiyah):</span> [Later] prophets taught [the additional forms of] Mem, Nun, Tzadi, Pe, Chaf. (Since there was only one Mem at the time of Matan Torah, it was final Mem; regular Mem came later!)</p>
<p class="bas indent2"><span class="nm">3.</span><span class="cl">Objection:</span> This cannot be! "Elu ha'Mitzvos" - prophets cannot change Mitzvos [after Matan Torah - the forms of the letters affects Tefilin, Sefer Torah...]!</p>
<p class="bas indent2"><span class="nm">4.</span><span class="cl">Answer:</span> All the forms were already known, just we did not know which go at the [beginning or] middle of words, and which at the end - the prophets taught this.</p>
<p class="bas indent2"><span class="nm">5.</span><span class="cl">Question:</span> Still, this is something new, prophecy may not teach it!</p>
<p class="bas indent2"><span class="nm">6.</span><span class="cl">Answer:</span> The prophets merely reminded us of something which had been known and was forgotten.</p>
<p class="bas indent1"><span class="nm">(b)</span><span class="cl">(Rav Chisda):</span> Two letters stood miraculously in the Luchos - [final] Mem and Samech.</p>
<p class="bas indent1"><span class="nm">(c)</span><span class="cl">(Rav Chisda):</span> The Luchos could be read from the front or back (the letters were carved out from one side to the other) - if from the front one read 'Nevuv', from the back one read [reversed, i.e.] 'Buvan'.</p>
<p class="bas subject"><span class="nm">2)</span>EXPOUNDING THE ALEPH BEIS</p>
<p class="bas indent1"><span class="nm">(a)</span><span class="cl">(Rabanan):</span> Children came to the Beis Medrash saying Chidushim [regarding the order of the Aleph-Beis] that were not said in the days of Yehoshua!</p>
<p class="bas indent1"><span class="nm">(b)</span>(The names of some letters are expounded like words; often we expound a word beginning with that letter.) Aleph Beis - Aleph (learn) Binah (understanding, i.e. Torah); Gimel Dalet - Gomel Dalim (bestow to the poor).</p>
<p class="bas indent1"><span class="nm">(c)</span><span class="cl">Question:</span> [When the letters are written in order,] why does the leg of Gimel [that sticks out] point towards Dalet?</p>
<p class="bas indent1"><span class="nm">(d)</span><span class="cl">Answer:</span> This teaches that the giver should go to the poor (do not make the poor come to you).</p>
<p class="bas indent1"><span class="nm">(e)</span><span class="cl">Question:</span> Why does the face (interior) of Dalet point away from Gimel?</p>
<p class="bas indent1"><span class="nm">(f)</span><span class="cl">Answer:</span> This teaches that one should give covertly, so the receiver will not be ashamed.</p>
<p class="bas indent1"><span class="nm">(g)</span>Hei Vov - this is a name of Hash-m (Ani v'<i>Hu</i>); Zayin Ches, Tes Yud, Chaf Lamed - if you will do so (learn Torah and bestow to the poor), Hash-m will Zan (feed) you, give you CHen (grace), MeiTiv (do good) to you, give you Yerushah (inheritance), tie to you a Keser (crown) L'Olam ha'Ba (in the world to come).</p>
<p class="bas indent1"><span class="nm">(h)</span>There is an open Mem and a closed Mem, alluding to an open Ma'amar (matters which may be expounded) and a closed Ma'amar (things which should not be expounded, e.g. the Merkavah);</p>
<p class="bas indent1"><span class="nm">(i)</span>There is a bent Nun and a straight Nun - a Ne'eman (proper person) must be bent (humble), then he will be upright in the world to come.</p>
<p class="bas indent1"><span class="nm">(j)</span>Samech Ayin - one must Somech (support) Aniyim (poor people); alternatively - Simanim Ase, make ways to remember Torah and acquire it;</p>
<p class="bas indent1"><span class="nm">(k)</span>There is a bent Pe and an open Pe - sometimes the Peh (mouth) should be open (when there is no bigger Chacham to disseminate Torah), at other times it should be closed.</p>
<p class="bas indent1"><span class="nm">(l)</span>There is a bent Tzadi and an open Tzadi - a Tzadik must be bent, then he will be upright in the world to come.</p>
<p class="bas indent1"><span class="nm">(m)</span><span class="cl">Question:</span> We already expounded this regarding Nun!</p>
<p class="bas indent1"><span class="nm">(n)</span><span class="cl">Answer:</span> This teaches that one should reach higher and higher levels of humility - Torah is given amidst awe and humility.</p>
<p class="bas indent1"><span class="nm">(o)</span>Kuf represents Kadosh, Reish is Rasha - the Kuf does not look at the face of the Reish, to teach that Hash-m cannot bear to look at the face of a Rasha.</p>
<p class="bas indent1"><span class="nm">(p)</span><span class="cl">Question:</span> Why is there a [crown like a] Zayin on the top of the Kuf facing the Reish?</p>
<p class="bas indent1"><span class="nm">(q)</span><span class="cl">Answer:</span> Hash-m says, if he will repent, I will tie a crown on him, like I have.</p>
<p class="bas subject"><span class="nm">3)</span>OTHER THINGS LEARNED FROM THE LETTERS</p>
<p class="bas indent1"><span class="nm">(a)</span><span class="cl">Question:</span> Why is the leg of the Kuf disconnected?</p>
<p class="bas indent1"><span class="nm">(b)</span><span class="cl">Answer:</span> If he will repent, there is an opening for him to enter.</p>
<p class="bas indent1"><span class="nm">(c)</span>This supports Reish Lakish:</p>
<p class="bas indent2"><span class="nm">1.</span><span class="cl">(Reish Lakish):</span> "Im la'Letzim Hu Yalitz vela'Anavim Yiten Chen" - Hash-m gives opportunity for one who wants to defile himself, He helps (makes an opening) for one who wants to Metaher himself.</p>
<p class="bas indent1"><span class="nm">(d)</span>Shin represents Sheker, Tov is [the last letter] of Emes.</p>
<p class="bas indent1"><span class="nm">(e)</span><span class="cl">Question:</span> Why are the letters of Sheker next to each other, whereas the letters of Emes are spread out (at the beginning, middle and end of the Alef Beis)?</p>
<p class="bas indent1"><span class="nm">(f)</span><span class="cl">Answer:</span> Falsehood is common, truth is hard to find.</p>
<p class="bas indent1"><span class="nm">(g)</span><span class="cl">Question:</span> Why do the letters of Sheker have a single narrow leg, and the letters of Emes have a [wide] base like a brick?</p>
<p class="bas indent1"><span class="nm">(h)</span><span class="cl">Answer:</span> Truth stands, falsehood does not.</p>
<p class="bas indent1"><span class="nm">(i)</span>(We now pair letters from the beginning to the end of the Aleph Beis and expound them.) Aleph Tov - he despises Me, should I desire him?</p>
<p class="bas indent1"><span class="nm">(j)</span>Beis Shin - he does not treasure Me, should My name rest upon him? Gimel Reish - he defiled his body, should I have mercy on him? Dalet Kuf - He locked My doors, will I not cut down his horns?</p>
<p class="bas indent1"><span class="nm">(k)</span>We expounded regarding Resha'im - now we expound regarding Tzadikim.</p>
<p class="bas indent1"><span class="nm">(l)</span>Aleph Tov Beis Shin - if you will feel Bushah (shame, in front of Me), Gimel Reish Dalet Kuf - you will live in Duk (Heaven; alternatively - the One who lives in Heaven will cause that) Hei Tzadi Vov Pe - a Chatzitzah will separate between you and anger.</p>
<p class="bas indent1"><span class="nm">(m)</span>Zayin Ayin Ches Samech Tes Nun - you will not tremble on account of the Satan; Yud Mem Kaf Lamed - the angel appointed over Gehinom asks Hash-m that everyone fall into his great sea (Gehinom), even Yisrael; Hash-m responds Aleph Ches Samech, Beis Tes Ayin, Gimel Yud Pe (skipping six letters each time) - I have mercy on them, for they shunned adultery;</p>
<p class="bas indent1"><span class="nm">(n)</span>Dalet Kuf Tzadi - they are humble, truthful and Tzadikim; Hei Lamed Kuf - you (Sar of Gehinom) have no stake in Yisrael;</p>
<p class="bas indent1"><span class="nm">(o)</span>Vov Mem Reish Zayin Nun Shin Tov - the Sar of Gehinom requests to be fed from all descendants of Shes;</p>
<p class="bas indent1"><span class="nm">(p)</span>Hash-m responds Aleph Lamed Beis Mem Gimel Nun Dalet Samech (skipping half the Aleph Beis each time), you have no stake in them (Yisrael), I am taking them to the Gan of myrtle (Eden);</p>
<p class="bas indent1"><span class="nm">(q)</span>Hei Ayin Vov Pe - I (the Sar) am faint from hunger! Zayin Tzadi Ches Kuf - Hash-m answers, these descend from Yitzchak; Tes Reish Yud Shin Kaf Tes - I have others (Nochrim) stored up for you.</p>

<p class="bas indent2"><span class="nm">1.</span>He wrote two letters in one Helam, using Deyo, Sam, Sikra, Kumus, Kankantom or anything that marks;</p>
<p class="bas indent2"><span class="nm">2.</span>He wrote on two walls that meet in a corner, or on two tablets that can be read together;</p>
<p class="bas indent2"><span class="nm">3.</span>He wrote on his skin.</p>
<p class="bas indent1"><span class="nm">(b)</span>R. Eliezer says, if he scratched on his skin he is Chayav Chatas;</p>
<p class="bas indent1"><span class="nm">(c)</span>Chachamim exempt.</p>
<p class="bas indent1"><span class="nm">(d)</span>In the following cases he is exempt:</p>
<p class="bas indent2"><span class="nm">1.</span>He wrote with [ohliquids, fruit juice, mud (alternatively - in dry dirt), dust of residue left in an inkwell, or anything that does not last;</p>

<p class="bas indent2"><span class="nm">7.</span>He wrote on two walls or in two columns of a tablet that cannot be read together;</p>
<p class="bas indent1"><span class="nm">(e)</span>R. Yehudah ben Beseira is Mechayev if he wrote one letter Notrikun (with a mark showing that it represents a word);</p>
<p class="bas indent1"><span class="nm">(f)</span>Chachamim exempt.</p>
<p class="bas indent1"><span class="nm">(g)</span><span class="cl">(Gemara):</span> Deyo is ink, Sam is orpiment (a yellow dye).</p>
<p class="bas indent1"><span class="nm">(h)</span><span class="cl">(Rabah bar bar Chanah):</span> Sikra is a red dye.</p>
<p class="bas indent1"><span class="nm">(i)</span>Kumus is sap;</p>
<p class="bas indent1"><span class="nm">(j)</span><span class="cl">(Rabah bar bar Chanah):</span> Kankantom is vitriol.</p>
<p class="bas indent1"><span class="nm">(k)</span><span class="cl">(Mishnah):</span> Or anything that marks.</p>
<p class="bas indent1"><span class="nm">(l)</span><span class="cl">Question:</span> What does this come to include?</p>
<p class="bas indent1"><span class="nm">(m)</span><span class="cl">Answer (R. Chananyah - Beraisa):</span> If a Get was written with rainwater (alternatively - juice of Tarya (a fruit)) or with gallnut juice, it is valid.</p>

<p class="bas indent1"><span class="nm">(p)</span><span class="cl">(Beraisa - R. Eliezer):</span> [We find that people do this -] Ben Stada smuggled witchcraft out of Mitzrayim scratched on his skin!</p>
<p class="bas indent1"><span class="nm">(q)</span><span class="cl">Chachamim:</span> He was a lunatic - we do not bring proofs from lunatics [normal people do not do this].</p>
<p class="bas subject"><span class="nm">5)</span>EXEMPTIONS FOR WRITING</p>
<p class="bas indent1"><span class="nm">(a)</span><span class="cl">(Mishnah):</span> If he wrote one letter next to a letter that was already written [he is exempt].</p>
<p class="bas indent1"><span class="nm">(b)</span><span class="cl">Question:</span> Who is the Tana of the Mishnah?</p>
<p class="bas indent1"><span class="nm">(c)</span><span class="cl">Answer (Rabah bar Rav Huna):</span> It is unlike R. Eliezer:</p>
<p class="bas indent2"><span class="nm">1.</span><span class="cl">(Mishnah - R. Eliezer):</span> If one wove another thread onto something woven, he is liable.</p>
<p class="bas indent1"><span class="nm">(d)</span><span class="cl">(Mishnah):</span> He wrote on top of letters that were already written.</p>
<p class="bas indent1"><span class="nm">(e)</span><span class="cl">Question:</span> Who is the Tana of the Mishnah?</p>
<p class="bas indent1"><span class="nm">(f)</span><span class="cl">Answer (Rav Chisda):</span> It is unlike R. Yehudah:</p>
<p class="bas indent2"><span class="nm">1.</span><span class="cl">(Beraisa - R. Yehudah):</span> If a scribe was writing a Sefer Torah and needed to write Hash-m's name, but he intended to write 'Yehudah' and mistakenly omitted the Dalet (so the letters of Hash-m's name were written, but without the required intent for His name), he may trace the quill over the letters, to Mekadesh the name;</p>
<p class="bas indent2"><span class="nm">2.</span>Chachamim say, this is not an ideal writing of Hash-m's name.</p>
<p class="bas indent1"><span class="nm">(g)</span><span class="cl">(Beraisa):</span> If one wrote one letter and completed a Sefer, or wove one thread and completed a garment, he is liable.</p>
<p class="bas indent1"><span class="nm">(h)</span><span class="cl">Question:</span> Who is the Tana of the Beraisa?</p>
<p class="bas indent1"><span class="nm">(i)</span><span class="cl">Answer #1 (Rabah bar Rav Huna):</span> It is R. Eliezer, who says that if one wove another thread onto something woven, he is liable.</p>
<p class="bas indent1"><span class="nm">(j)</span><span class="cl">Answer #2 (Rav Ashi):</span> It is even like Chachamim - they agree that one is liable for finishing something.</p>
<p class="bas indent1"><span class="nm">(k)</span><span class="cl">(R. Ami):</span> If one wrote one letter in Tiverya and one letter in Tzipori, he is liable - it is writing, just the letters must be brought together.</p>
<p class="bas indent1"><span class="nm">(l)</span><span class="cl">Question (Mishnah):</span> If he wrote on two walls or on two columns of a tablet that cannot be read together, he is exempt.</p>
<p class="bas indent1"><span class="nm">(m)</span><span class="cl">Answer:</span> There, an action must be done to bring the letters together (he must cut the tablet or wall in between) - here, he need only bring them together.</p>
<p class="bas indent1"><span class="nm">(n)</span><span class="cl">(Beraisa):</span> If one corrected one letter, he is liable.</p>
<p class="bas indent1"><span class="nm">(o)</span><span class="cl">Question:</span> If one is exempt for writing one letter, why is he liable for correcting one letter?!</p>
<p class="bas indent1"><span class="nm">(p)</span><span class="cl">Answer #1 (Rav Sheshes):</span> He removed the roof in the middle of Ches, thereby 'writing' the letter Zayin twice.</p>
<p class="bas indent1"><span class="nm">(q)</span><span class="cl">Answer #2 (Rava):</span> Even if he removed the protrusion [in the top right corner] of a Dalet, thereby making it a Reish, he is liable (for this fixes the Sefer - it is forbidden to have an errant Sefer).</p>
<p class="bas indent1"><span class="nm">(r)</span><span class="cl">(Beraisa #1):</span> If one intended to write one letter and he wrote two, he is liable;</p>
<p class="bas indent1"><span class="nm">(s)</span><span class="cl">Contradiction (Beraisa #2):</span> He is exempt.</p>
<p class="bas indent1"><span class="nm">(t)</span><span class="cl">Resolution:</span> If the letters require crowns, he is exempt [for he is not yet finished].</p>
