<p class="bas subject"><span class="nm">1)</span>KORBAN METZORA MI'SAFEK</p>
<p class="bas indent1"><span class="nm">(a)</span><span class="cl">Question #3:</span> If the Korbanos of two Metzora'im became mixed with each other, and one of them was offered, and one Metzora died, what does the other one do? (He is unsure whether or not his Korbanos were offered already. He may not offer (the remaining animals or new animals for) Chatas or Asham mi'Safek (when in Safek whether he is obligated).)</p>
<p class="bas indent1"><span class="nm">(b)</span><span class="cl">Answer (R. Yehoshua):</span> He gives his property to someone else (presumably a relative who will return the money to him later), and then he is considered poor. An Oni brings Chatas ha'Of, which one may offer mi'Safek.</p>
<p class="bas indent1"><span class="nm">(c)</span><span class="cl">Question:</span> Still, he may not offer the Asham (it is Me'akev eating Kodshim)!</p>
<p class="bas indent1"><span class="nm">(d)</span><span class="cl">Answer (Shmuel):</span> The case is, he already offered his Asham. (The Ashamos of both were offered, or the Ashamos were never mixed).</p>
<p class="bas indent1"><span class="nm">(e)</span><span class="cl">Objection (Rav Sheshes):</span> How could a great Chacham like Shmuel err?! His answer is not like any Tana!</p>
<p class="bas indent2"><span class="nm">1.</span>It is not like R. Yehudah, who considers the wealth of a Metzora (to determine if he brings Korban Oni or Ashir) at the time he brings the Asham. If he was wealthy then, giving away his property afterwards does not allow him to bring Korban Oni!</p>
<p class="bas indent3"><span class="nm">i.</span><span class="cl">(Mishnah - R. Shimon):</span> If a Metzora brought (some of) the Korbanos Metzora of an Oni and then became rich, or vice-versa, we consider his wealth at the time he brings the Chatas;</p>
<p class="bas indent3"><span class="nm">ii.</span>R. Yehudah says, it is determined at the time he brings the Asham.</p>
<p class="bas indent3"><span class="nm">iii.</span>R. Eliezer ben Yakov says, it is determined at the time he brings birds (that permit him to enter the city).</p>
<p class="bas indent2"><span class="nm">2.</span>It is not like R. Shimon, who says that the Chatas determines it. He permits one to stipulate and bring an Asham mi'Safek! (If so, we need not say that the Asham was offered already.)</p>
<p class="bas indent3"><span class="nm">i.</span><span class="cl">(Beraisa - R. Shimon):</span> (If a Metzora Muchlat was healed, but he is unsure whether or not he fulfilled Taharas Metzora,) on the day after (shaving and immersing) he brings (a lamb for) Asham Metzora and a Log of oil, and stipulates:</p>
<p class="bas indent3"><span class="nm">ii.</span>If I must bring Asham Metzora, this is the Asham and the accompanying oil. If I am exempt, the lamb is a Shelamim Nedavah;</p>
<p class="bas indent3"><span class="nm">iii.</span>It must be slaughtered in the north (perhaps it is an Asham). Some of the blood must be put on his ear, thumb and toe. It requires Nesachim (in any case), Tenufah of Chazeh v'Shok (in case it is a Shelamim); and Semichah. (Some say that Asham Metzora does not require Semichah mid'Oraisa, so he does not do proper Semichah, for there is no Heter to lean on the Korban.)</p>
<p class="bas bbbline">70b----------------------------------------70b</p>
<p class="bas indent3"><span class="nm">iv.</span>It may be eaten for only one day and the following night by male Kohanim. (Perhaps it is an Asham. Shelamim should be permitted to all, for two days. In the Beraisa, the Metzora is also a Safek Nazir Tamei. The above laws do not depend on this.)</p>
<p class="bas indent3"><span class="nm">v.</span>Chachamim do not allow bringing the Asham on condition, lest it cause Kodshim to be burned (due to Safek. If the animal is not eaten by morning, perhaps it is really a Shelamim, which is permitted until the next evening, but we may not eat it, for to us it is a Safek Asham)</p>
<p class="bas indent1"><span class="nm">(f)</span><span class="cl">Answer (to Objection (e)):</span> Shmuel holds like R. Shimon regarding Korban Metzora (we consider his wealth when he brings the Chatas). He holds like Chachamim regarding Asham (it may not be brought on condition).</p>
<p class="bas subject"><span class="nm">2)</span>MORE QUESTIONS OF THE ALEXANDRIANS</p>
<p class="bas indent1"><span class="nm">(a)</span><span class="cl">Question #1 (of Agadata):</span> It says "Ki Lo Echpatz b'Mos ha'Mes," and it says "Ki Chafetz Hash-m Lahamisam"!</p>
<p class="bas indent1"><span class="nm">(b)</span><span class="cl">Answer (R. Yehoshua):</span> Hash-m desires to kill sinners who are not repenting, but not those who are repenting.</p>
<p class="bas indent1"><span class="nm">(c)</span><span class="cl">Question #2:</span> It says "Ki Lo Yisa Fanim v'Lo Yikach Shochad," and it says "Yisa Hash-m Panav Elecha"!</p>
<p class="bas indent1"><span class="nm">(d)</span><span class="cl">Answer (R. Yehoshua):</span> Hash-m shows favoritism (Tosfos; Maharsha - turns His countenance towards someone) before the final verdict, but not afterwards.</p>
<p class="bas indent1"><span class="nm">(e)</span><span class="cl">Question #3:</span> It says "Ki Vachar Hash-m b'Tziyon," and it says "Ki Al Api v'Al Chamasi Haysah ha'Ir ha'Zos l'Min ha'Yom Asher Banu Osah... "!</p>
<p class="bas indent1"><span class="nm">(f)</span><span class="cl">Answer (R. Yehoshua):</span> He chose Yerushalayim before Shlomo married. Afterwards, He was angry. (Maharsha - "Banu Osah" refers to Rome, who destroyed the second Mikdash. Its foundation was made the day Shlomo married Paro's daughter.)</p>
<p class="bas indent1"><span class="nm">(g)</span><span class="cl">Question #1 (of the silly matters):</span> Is Lot's wife Metamei?</p>
<p class="bas indent1"><span class="nm">(h)</span><span class="cl">Answer (R. Yehoshua):</span> No. Mesim (flesh and bones) are Metamei, but a pillar of salt is not.</p>
<p class="bas indent1"><span class="nm">(i)</span><span class="cl">Question #2:</span> Was the Shunamis' son (whom Elisha brought back to life) Tamei (like a Mes)? (Maharsha - the Alexandrians suspected that essentially he was still dead, he just showed Simanim of life due to Elisha's prayer.)</p>
<p class="bas indent1"><span class="nm">(j)</span><span class="cl">Answer (R. Yehoshua):</span> The dead are Teme'im (like a corpse), but the living are not. (He was fully alive.)</p>
<p class="bas indent1"><span class="nm">(k)</span><span class="cl">Question #3:</span> When the dead will come back to life, will they need to have Mei Chatas sprinkled on them (like one who became Tamei Mes? Maharsha - they asked only about one who died while he was Tamei Mes.)</p>
<p class="bas indent1"><span class="nm">(l)</span><span class="cl">Version #1 - Answer (R. Yehoshua):</span> When they are revived, we will investigate this.</p>
<p class="bas indent1"><span class="nm">(m)</span><span class="cl">Version #2 - Answer (R. Yehoshua):</span> When Moshe will come with them (he will tell us).</p>
<p class="bas indent1"><span class="nm">(n)</span><span class="cl">Question #1 (of Derech Eretz):</span> What should one do in order to grow wise? (Maharsha - this, and also Chachmah and sons, which they asked about below, depend on Mazal. How can one change it?)</p>
<p class="bas indent1"><span class="nm">(o)</span><span class="cl">Answer (R. Yehoshua):</span> He should spend much time learning and minimize business.</p>
<p class="bas indent2"><span class="nm">1.</span><span class="cl">The Alexandrians:</span> Many did so, and they did not become wise!</p>
<p class="bas indent2"><span class="nm">2.</span><span class="cl">R. Yehoshua:</span> He should request Chachmah from its owner -- "Ki Hash-m Yiten Chachmah mi'Piv Da'as u'Sevunah";</p>
<p class="bas indent3"><span class="nm">i.</span><span class="cl">(R. Chiya - Beraisa):</span> "Mi'Piv" alludes to a parable. A mortal king made a meal for his servants. He gave to his dear friends from his portion.</p>

<p class="bas indent1"><span class="nm">(q)</span><span class="cl">Answer (R. Yehoshua):</span> He should (do much business and - Gra deletes this from the text) engage in business with integrity.</p>
