<p class="dedicationbox"><br>PAST DEDICATION<br>BAVA KAMA 31 - dedicated by Dr. Moshe and Rivka Snow in memory of Rivka's mother, Rebbetzin Leah bas Rav Yosef (Rabinowitz), the Manostrishtcher Rebbetzin, whose Yahrzeit is 15 Teves. </p>

<p class="bas subject"><span class="nm">1)</span>WHEN IS ONE WHO TRIPPED LIABLE?</p>
<p class="bas indent1"><span class="nm">(a)</span><span class="cl">(Mishnah):</span> If two potters were walking one after the other, and one tripped, and the other tripped over him, the first pays the damages.</p>
<p class="bas indent1"><span class="nm">(b)</span><span class="cl">(Gemara - R. Yochanan):</span> Do not say that our Mishnah is only like R. Meir, who says that one who trips is negligent, and therefore liable;</p>
<p class="bas indent2"><span class="nm">1.</span>Rather, our Mishnah is even like Chachamim, who say that one who trips is not negligent, and exempt;</p>
<p class="bas indent2"><span class="nm">2.</span>In our Mishnah, he is liable, for he should have gotten up.</p>
<p class="bas indent1"><span class="nm">(c)</span><span class="cl">(Rav Nachman bar Yitzchak):</span> Even if he was unable to get up, he is liable. He should have warned Shimon.</p>
<p class="bas indent2"><span class="nm">1.</span>R. Yochanan disagrees. Since he cannot get up, he is distracted, and he is not obligated to warn.</p>
<p class="bas subject"><span class="nm">2)</span>STOPPING IN A <i>RESHUS</i> <i>HA'RABIM</i></p>
<p class="bas indent1"><span class="nm">(a)</span><span class="cl">(Mishnah):</span> If Reuven was walking, carrying a beam, and Shimon was walking in back of him, carrying a jug, and the jug broke on the beam, Reuven is exempt;</p>
<p class="bas indent1"><span class="nm">(b)</span>If Reuven stopped, he is liable.</p>
<p class="bas indent1"><span class="nm">(c)</span><span class="cl">Suggestion:</span> The case is, Reuven stopped to adjust the beam, which is normal, and still he is liable, for he should have warned (even though he was distracted. This refutes R. Yochanan!)</p>
<p class="bas indent1"><span class="nm">(d)</span><span class="cl">Rejection:</span> No, he stopped to rest (which is abnormal).</p>
<p class="bas indent1"><span class="nm">(e)</span><span class="cl">Inference:</span> Had he had stopped to adjust it, he would be exempt.</p>
<p class="bas indent1"><span class="nm">(f)</span><span class="cl">Question:</span> If so, why does the Reisha say that if he warned Shimon, he is exempt? It should distinguish between stopping to rest and to adjust!</p>
<p class="bas indent2"><span class="nm">1.</span>The Mishnah should say 'he is liable only when he stopped to rest. If he stopped to adjust, he is exempt'!</p>
<p class="bas indent1"><span class="nm">(g)</span><span class="cl">Answer:</span> The Mishnah teaches a different Chidush. Even if he stopped to rest, if he warned, he is exempt.</p>
<p class="bas indent1"><span class="nm">(h)</span><span class="cl">Question (Beraisa):</span> Potters and glassmakers were walking one after the other. Reuven (the first one) tripped and fell; Shimon tripped on Reuven, and Levi on Shimon. Reuven pays the damages to Shimon, and Shimon pays the damages to Levi.</p>
<p class="bas indent2"><span class="nm">1.</span>If they all fell due to Reuven, he pays all the damages.</p>
<p class="bas indent2"><span class="nm">2.</span>If they warned each other, all are exempt.</p>
<p class="bas indent2"><span class="nm">3.</span><span class="cl">Suggestion:</span> They were unable to stand (they are liable because they should have warned).</p>
<p class="bas indent1"><span class="nm">(i)</span><span class="cl">Rejection:</span> No, they could have stood.</p>
<p class="bas indent1"><span class="nm">(j)</span><span class="cl">Inference:</span> If they could not have stood, they would be exempt.</p>
<p class="bas indent1"><span class="nm">(k)</span>If so, why does the Reisha say that if they warned each other, they are exempt? It should distinguish between whether or not they could not have stood!</p>
<p class="bas indent2"><span class="nm">1.</span>The Beraisa should say 'they are liable only when they could have stood. If they were unable to stand, they are exempt'!</p>
<p class="bas indent1"><span class="nm">(l)</span><span class="cl">Answer:</span> The Beraisa teaches a different Chidush. Even when they could have stood, if they warned each other, they are exempt.</p>
<p class="bas subject"><span class="nm">3)</span>FOR WHICH DAMAGES MUST THEY PAY?</p>
<p class="bas indent1"><span class="nm">(a)</span><span class="cl">(Rava):</span> Reuven pays the damages to Shimon, both bodily damage (to Shimon himself, due to Reuven's body or property) and property damage (to Shimon's property, caused by Reuven's body).</p>
<p class="bas indent2"><span class="nm">1.</span>Shimon pays to Levi only bodily damage, but not property damage.</p>
<p class="bas indent1"><span class="nm">(b)</span><span class="cl">Question:</span> This is inconsistent!</p>
<p class="bas indent2"><span class="nm">1.</span>If one who trips is negligent, Shimon should be liable also for property damage!</p>
<p class="bas indent2"><span class="nm">2.</span>If one who trips is not negligent, Reuven should be exempt even for bodily damage!</p>
<p class="bas bbbline">31b----------------------------------------31b</p>
<p class="bas indent1"><span class="nm">(c)</span><span class="cl">Answer:</span> Reuven is certainly negligent (because he tripped on his own). Shimon is blameless for falling, but is liable for damage due to his body, for he should have gotten up.</p>
<p class="bas indent2"><span class="nm">1.</span>He is exempt for damage due to his property, because he cannot be blamed for his property falling, and he made it Hefker. (We explain like Tosfos and Rashi's latter Perush (Sof 31b).)</p>
<p class="bas indent1"><span class="nm">(d)</span><span class="cl">Question (Beraisa):</span> Every one of them is liable for bodily damage, and exempt for property damage.</p>
<p class="bas indent2"><span class="nm">1.</span><span class="cl">Suggestion:</span> This applies even to the first.</p>
<p class="bas indent1"><span class="nm">(e)</span><span class="cl">Answer #1:</span> No, it applies to all except the first.</p>
<p class="bas indent1"><span class="nm">(f)</span><span class="cl">Question:</span> It says 'every one of them'!</p>
<p class="bas indent1"><span class="nm">(g)</span><span class="cl">Answer (Rav Ada bar Ahavah):</span> It means, every one of those injured.</p>
<p class="bas indent1"><span class="nm">(h)</span><span class="cl">Objection:</span> This is unreasonable!</p>
<p class="bas indent2"><span class="nm">1.</span>Granted, if it means even the first, this is why it says 'every one of them.'</p>
<p class="bas indent2"><span class="nm">2.</span>But if it means all other than the first, let it just say 'the injured'!</p>
<p class="bas indent1"><span class="nm">(i)</span><span class="cl">Retraction (Rava):</span> Rather, Reuven must pay the damages to Shimon, both damage to Shimon's body and to his property (Reuven is not negligent for falling, rather for not getting up);</p>
<p class="bas indent2"><span class="nm">1.</span>Shimon pays only damage to Levi's body, but not to Levi's property.</p>
<p class="bas indent1"><span class="nm">(j)</span><span class="cl">Question:</span> Why is Shimon exempt for damage to Levi's property?</p>
<p class="bas indent1"><span class="nm">(k)</span><span class="cl">Answer:</span> Shimon's body is an obstacle. It is considered a pit (he is even less negligent than Reuven, who tripped by himself). One does not pay for Kelim damaged by a pit (only for people and animals).</p>
<p class="bas indent1"><span class="nm">(l)</span><span class="cl">Question:</span> This is like Shmuel, who says that every obstacle is like a pit;</p>
<p class="bas indent2"><span class="nm">1.</span>According to Rav, who says that an obstacle is like a pit only if the owner made it Hefker (ownerless), how can we answer?</p>
<p class="bas indent1"><span class="nm">(m)</span><span class="cl">Answer:</span> Really, it is like we said above (a). Reuven pays to Shimon damages due to Reuven's body and property;</p>
<p class="bas indent2"><span class="nm">1.</span>Shimon pays only damage that his own body caused to Levi, but not what his property caused.</p>
<p class="bas indent1"><span class="nm">(n)</span><span class="cl">Answer #2 (to question (d) - Rav Ada bar Minyomi):</span> The Beraisa says 'every one of them is liable for damage due to his own body, and exempt for damage due to his property.' It discusses damage to Kelim. (One is liable for all damage caused by his own body. He is exempt for damage caused by his property to Kelim. Reuven's property is like a pit. Shimon's property is not liable even like a pit.)</p>
<p class="bas indent1"><span class="nm">(o)</span><span class="cl">(Beraisa):</span> If they all fell due to Reuven, he pays all the damages.</p>
<p class="bas indent1"><span class="nm">(p)</span><span class="cl">Question:</span> How is it that they all fell due to Reuven?</p>
<p class="bas indent1"><span class="nm">(q)</span><span class="cl">Answer #1 (Rav Papa):</span> Reuven fell across the width of the road.</p>
<p class="bas indent1"><span class="nm">(r)</span><span class="cl">Answer #2 (Rav Zvid):</span> He fell like a blind man's stick (diagonally, covering the width of the road). (Tosfos - if he fell horizontally, like Rav Papa said, he would be liable only for damage to Shimon. The latter victims were negligent for not being careful, even after they saw others fall before them.)</p>
<p class="bas subject"><span class="nm">4)</span>COLLISIONS IN THE <i>RESHUS</i> <i>HA'RABIM</i></p>
<p class="bas indent1"><span class="nm">(a)</span><span class="cl">(Mishnah):</span> If Reuven was walking, carrying a jug, and Shimon is walking towards him, carrying a beam, and the jug collided with the beam and broke, Shimon is exempt. Both of them have the right to walk.</p>
<p class="bas indent1"><span class="nm">(b)</span>If Reuven was walking in back of Shimon, and the jug broke on the beam, Shimon is exempt.</p>
