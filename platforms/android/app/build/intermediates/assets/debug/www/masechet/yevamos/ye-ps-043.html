<p class="bas subject"><span class="nm">1)</span>IS THERE A <i>STAM</i> <i>MISHNAH</i> THAT WE DO NOT FOLLOW?</p>
<p class="bas indent1"><span class="nm">(a)</span><span class="cl">Question (R. Nachum):</span> Sometimes the Halachah does not follow a Stam Mishnah!</p>
<p class="bas indent2"><span class="nm">1.</span><span class="cl">(Mishnah):</span> If a flax comb is missing teeth, if two teeth remain, they can become Tamei. If one tooth remains, it is Tahor;</p>
<p class="bas indent2"><span class="nm">2.</span>Each tooth that is taken from the comb is Tamei;</p>
<p class="bas indent2"><span class="nm">3.</span>If every alternate tooth was taken from a wool comb, it is Tahor. If three remain in one place, it is Tamei. If one of them is the end tooth, it is Tahor.</p>
<p class="bas indent2"><span class="nm">4.</span>If two were taken and they were made into tongs they are Tamei. If one was taken and fixed for a lamp or for stretching parchment, it is Tamei.</p>
<p class="bas indent2"><span class="nm">5.</span><span class="cl">(Summation of question):</span> Even though this is a Stam Mishnah, the Halachah does not follow it!</p>
<p class="bas indent1"><span class="nm">(b)</span><span class="cl">Answer (R. Avahu):</span> This Mishnah is an exception. R. Yochanan and Reish Lakish both said that it is not an authentic Mishnah.</p>
<p class="bas indent1"><span class="nm">(c)</span><span class="cl">Question:</span> Why did they say so?</p>
<p class="bas indent1"><span class="nm">(d)</span><span class="cl">Answer #1 (Rav Huna bar Mano'ach):</span> The Reisha contradicts the Seifa.</p>
<p class="bas indent2"><span class="nm">1.</span>'If every alternate tooth was taken from a wool comb, it is Tahor' implies that if two remain together, it is Tamei;</p>
<p class="bas indent2"><span class="nm">2.</span>'If three remain in one place it is Tamei' implies that if two remain together it is Tahor!</p>
<p class="bas indent1"><span class="nm">(e)</span><span class="cl">Objection:</span> This is not difficult. Perhaps if one of the two is the end tooth it is Tahor (for it is not useful), and if not, it is Tamei!</p>
<p class="bas indent1"><span class="nm">(f)</span><span class="cl">Answer #2:</span> Rather, the Reisha says that an individual tooth taken is Tamei, even if it was not fixed for usage. The Seifa says that it was prepared for a lamp or for stretching it is Tamei. This implies that if it was not prepared, it is Tahor!</p>
<p class="bas indent1"><span class="nm">(g)</span><span class="cl">Objection #1 (Abaye):</span> This is not difficult. A tooth removed with a small wooden holder is Tamei without further preparation. If it lacks this, it is Tahor until it is prepared!</p>
<p class="bas indent1"><span class="nm">(h)</span><span class="cl">Objection #2 (Rav Papa):</span> We can say that strong teeth need no preparation, but weak teeth need preparation!</p>
<p class="bas indent1"><span class="nm">(i)</span><span class="cl">Answer #3:</span> Rather, the correct text of the Mishnah concludes 'this is R. Shimon's opinion' (it is not a Stam Mishnah).</p>
<p class="bas subject"><span class="nm">2)</span>HOW LONG MUST ONE WAIT BEFORE <i>KIDUSHIN</i>?</p>
<p class="bas indent1"><span class="nm">(a)</span><span class="cl">(R. Chiya bar Avin):</span> We may be Mekadesh within three months. We do so in practice.</p>
<p class="bas indent1"><span class="nm">(b)</span><span class="cl">(R. Elazar):</span> It suffices to wait the majority of the first and third months, and the entire second month.</p>
<p class="bas indent1"><span class="nm">(c)</span>Ameimar permitted to be Mekadesh on the 90th day.</p>
<p class="bas indent1"><span class="nm">(d)</span><span class="cl">Question #1 (Rav Ashi):</span> Rav and Shmuel say that she must wait three months, excluding the day of death and day of Kidushin!</p>
<p class="bas indent1"><span class="nm">(e)</span><span class="cl">Answer:</span> They said so (we exclude the first and last day) regarding a nursing woman:</p>
<p class="bas indent2"><span class="nm">1.</span><span class="cl">(Rav and Shmuel):</span> A nursing woman must wait 24 months (before remarrying), excluding the day the baby was born and the day of Kidushin.</p>
<p class="bas indent1"><span class="nm">(f)</span><span class="cl">Question #2:</span> A man made a Kidushin feast on the 90th day, and Rava canceled it!</p>
<p class="bas indent1"><span class="nm">(g)</span><span class="cl">Answer:</span> That was a wedding feast.</p>
<p class="bas indent1"><span class="nm">(h)</span>The Halachah is, a nursing mother must wait 24 months, excluding the day of birth and day of Kidushin;</p>
<p class="bas indent1"><span class="nm">(i)</span>All must wait three months, excluding the day of death and day of Kidushin.</p>
<p class="bas subject"><span class="nm">3)</span>ISURIM OF AVEILUS</p>
<p class="bas indent1"><span class="nm">(a)</span><span class="cl">(Mishnah - R. Yosi):</span> (Anyone may become Mekudeshes) except for a widow (due to Aveilus).</p>
<p class="bas indent1"><span class="nm">(b)</span><span class="cl">Question (Rav Chisda):</span> If Kidushin is permitted when one may not launder, all the more so it is permitted when one may launder!</p>
<p class="bas indent2"><span class="nm">1.</span>Rav Chisda refers to the following Mishnah and Beraisa;</p>
<p class="bas indent2"><span class="nm">2.</span><span class="cl">(Mishnah):</span> It is forbidden to cut hair or launder in the week (starting from Shabbos) in which Tishah b'Av falls. It is permitted on Thursday, for the honor of Shabbos.</p>
<p class="bas indent2"><span class="nm">3.</span><span class="cl">(Beraisa):</span> Before this time (Tishah b'Av), we decrease work, commerce, building, and planting. We may be Mekadesh, but we do not have Nisu'in or Se'udas Eirusin.</p>
<p class="bas indent1"><span class="nm">(c)</span><span class="cl">Answer:</span> The Beraisa permits Kidushin <i>before the week before</i> Tishah b'Av (laundering is permitted then).</p>
<p class="bas indent1"><span class="nm">(d)</span><span class="cl">Question (Rava):</span> We still have a Kal va'Chomer!</p>
<p class="bas indent2"><span class="nm">1.</span>(From Rosh Chodesh Av but) before the week we may not do [excessive] business, but Kidushin is permitted. When business is permitted (an Avel within 30 days), all the more so Kidushin is permitted!</p>
<p class="bas indent1"><span class="nm">(e)</span><span class="cl">Answer #1 - Correction:</span> The Mishnah should say that R. Yosi permits all women to get <i>married</i> (except for a widow).</p>
<p class="bas bbbline">43b----------------------------------------43b</p>
<p class="bas indent1"><span class="nm">(f)</span><span class="cl">Question:</span> Is R. Yosi not concerned for discerning the father?</p>
<p class="bas indent1"><span class="nm">(g)</span><span class="cl">Answer #1:</span> Indeed, he is not concerned!</p>
<p class="bas indent1"><span class="nm">(h)</span><span class="cl">Answer #2:</span> He is concerned. The Mishnah should say that anyone divorced from Kidushin may remarry (but a widow may not).</p>
<p class="bas indent1"><span class="nm">(i)</span><span class="cl">Objection:</span> That is R. Yehudah's opinion!</p>
<p class="bas indent1"><span class="nm">(j)</span><span class="cl">Answer:</span> They argue about whether or not a divorcee from Nisu'in may become Mekudeshes. R. Yehudah permits, and R. Yosi forbids.</p>
<p class="bas indent1"><span class="nm">(k)</span><span class="cl">Question:</span> R. Yosi permits this!</p>
<p class="bas indent2"><span class="nm">1.</span><span class="cl">(Beraisa - R. Yosi):</span> All women may become Mekudeshes, except for a widow, who must wait 30 days because of Aveilus. All may not have Nisu'in until three months.</p>
<p class="bas indent2"><span class="nm">2.</span><span class="cl">Objection:</span> This is no more conclusive than the Mishnah, which also says 'All women', and we established that it discusses divorcees from Kidushin. Perhaps also the Beraisa permits Kidushin for divorcees from Kidushin.</p>
<p class="bas indent2"><span class="nm">3.</span><span class="cl">Answer:</span> The Seifa forbids Nisu'in until three months. This implies that Kidushin is permitted!</p>
<p class="bas indent1"><span class="nm">(l)</span><span class="cl">Answer (Rava):</span> Explain the Beraisa thusly: R. Yosi permits divorcees from Kidushin to have Nisu'in. Widows must wait 30 days because of Aveilus. Women who were married may not become Mekudeshes for three months.</p>
<p class="bas indent1"><span class="nm">(m)</span><span class="cl">Question:</span> A widow from Kidushin does not mourn over her husband!</p>
<p class="bas indent2"><span class="nm">1.</span><span class="cl">(R. Chiya bar Ami - Beraisa):</span> If an Arusah died, the Arus is not considered an Onen (a mourner before burial of the Mes) and he need not become Tamei amidst burying her;</p>
<p class="bas indent2"><span class="nm">2.</span>Similarly, if he died she is not an Onenes and need not become Temei'ah;</p>
<p class="bas indent2"><span class="nm">3.</span>If she dies, he does not inherit her. If he dies, she collects her Kesuvah (if he wrote one to her).</p>
<p class="bas indent1"><span class="nm">(n)</span><span class="cl">Answer #2 (to Question (d)):</span> (Do not change the text of the Mishnah.) Tana'im argue about whether or not a woman may become Mekudeshes during Aveilus.</p>
<p class="bas indent2"><span class="nm">1.</span><span class="cl">(Beraisa):</span> From the first of Av until Tishah b'Av we diminish business, commerce, building, planting, Kidushin, and Nisu'in;</p>
<p class="bas indent2"><span class="nm">2.</span>The week of Tishah b'Av it is forbidden to cut hair and launder;</p>
<p class="bas indent2"><span class="nm">3.</span>Some say that the entire month is forbidden.</p>
<p class="bas indent1"><span class="nm">(o)</span><span class="cl">Objection (Rav Ashi):</span> Perhaps the Beraisa forbids only Se'udas Eirusin, but Kidushin itself is permitted!</p>
<p class="bas indent2"><span class="nm">1.</span><span class="cl">Question:</span> If so, also regarding Nisu'in we must say that only the meal is forbidden, but Nisu'in itself is permitted (but this is not true)!</p>
<p class="bas indent2"><span class="nm">2.</span><span class="cl">Answer:</span> That is not comparable. Nisu'in is joyous even without a meal, but Kidushin is not!</p>
<p class="bas indent1"><span class="nm">(p)</span><span class="cl">Answer #3 (Rav Ashi):</span> Rather, we are more stringent about the loss of a spouse, since this is a new Aveilus, and it is of an individual. The Aveilus over the Churban is an old Aveilus of the Tzibur, so we are lenient.</p>
<p class="bas subject"><span class="nm">4)</span>ONE MAY DO <i>YIBUM</i> WITH MANY WOMEN</p>
<p class="bas indent1"><span class="nm">(a)</span><span class="cl">(Mishnah):</span> If four brothers were married to four women and the brothers died, if the oldest brother wants he may do Yibum to all of them (this will be explained);</p>
<p class="bas indent1"><span class="nm">(b)</span>If a man was married to two women and died, Yibum or Chalitzah of one exempts the other.</p>
