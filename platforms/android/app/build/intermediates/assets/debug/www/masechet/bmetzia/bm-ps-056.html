<p class="bas subject"><span class="nm">1)</span>LENIENCIES OF <i>DEMAI</i></p>
<p class="bas indent1"><span class="nm">(a)</span><span class="cl">Answer (Rav Yosef):</span> Even though R. Meir is lenient about redeeming Ma'aser of Demai, he is stringent about eating it;</p>
<p class="bas indent2"><span class="nm">1.</span><span class="cl">(Beraisa - R. Meir):</span> Only a wholesaler may sell Demai. A regular person, whether selling a lot or little, must separate Ma'aser first.</p>
<p class="bas indent2"><span class="nm">2.</span>Chachamim say, even a regular person may sell or give Demai for a gift.</p>
<p class="bas indent1"><span class="nm">(b)</span><span class="cl">Question (Ravina - Mishnah - R. Meir):</span> If one buys from a Nachtom (Tosfos ha'Rosh - baker; Rashi - retailer of bread) who is not trustworthy about Ma'aser, he may separate warm bread (i.e. it was baked recently) to be Ma'aser on cold or vice-versa, even from different shapes of bread on each other.</p>
<p class="bas indent2"><span class="nm">1.</span>Granted, cold on warm is permitted, like R. Ilai taught;.</p>
<p class="bas indent3"><span class="nm">i.</span><span class="cl">(R. Ilai):</span> If one separated bad Peros to be Terumah on good Peros, it takes effect - "v'Lo Sisa Alav Chet..." (you will not bear sin if you separate good Peros).</p>
<p class="bas indent3"><span class="nm">ii.</span>If it would not become Terumah, why would he bear sin?! We conclude that if bad Peros are separated, it takes effect.</p>
<p class="bas indent2"><span class="nm">2.</span>But why may he separate from different shapes of bread on each other? Perhaps he will separate from tithed grain on untithed grain, or vice-versa!</p>
<p class="bas indent1"><span class="nm">(c)</span><span class="cl">Abaye:</span> R. Elazar asked a good question, and Shmuel's answer is insufficient!</p>
<p class="bas indent2"><span class="nm">1.</span>R. Elazar asked about (Terumas Ma'aser of Demai. Even Vadai Terumah is punishable only by) death b'Yedei (through) Shamayim, and Shmuel answered from (Gitin, which permit married women, for which the punishment was) death at the hands of Beis Din;</p>
<p class="bas indent2"><span class="nm">2.</span>Perhaps Chachamim are more stringent about death at the hands of Beis Din, since it is more stringent!</p>
<p class="bas indent1"><span class="nm">(d)</span><span class="cl">Abaye:</span> Rav Sheshes' question was improper. R. Elazar and Shmuel discusses (things punishable by) death, and he asked from (Ma'aser Sheni, which is only) a Lav - "Lo Suchal Le'echol"!</p>
<p class="bas indent2"><span class="nm">1.</span>Rav Yosef's answer was proper.</p>
<p class="bas indent1"><span class="nm">(e)</span><span class="cl">Question (Abaye):</span> Why did Ravina ask from a Nachtom? He should have supported the law from a Palter (wholesaler of bread)!</p>
<p class="bas indent2"><span class="nm">1.</span><span class="cl">(Mishnah - R. Meir):</span> One who buys from a Palter must tithe separately bread from each type of mold.</p>
<p class="bas indent1"><span class="nm">(f)</span><span class="cl">Answer:</span> He did not bring a support from a Palter, for we must say that he buys bread from different bakers, so surely one must tithe separately from each mold.</p>
<p class="bas indent1"><span class="nm">(g)</span><span class="cl">Rebuttal:</span> If so, we can likewise say that a Nachtom buys all (Rashi - his bread; Tosfos ha'Rosh - his wheat) from one person, so even if his bread is from different molds, we may tithe from one to another! (Therefore, Ravina's question was improper.)</p>
<p class="bas indent1"><span class="nm">(h)</span><span class="cl">(Rava):</span> Shmuel's answer was proper. Death is essentially the same, whether b'Yedei Shamayim or Beis Din.</p>
<p class="bas subject"><span class="nm">2)</span>ITEMS TO WHICH <i>ONA'AH</i> DOES NOT APPLY</p>
<p class="bas indent1"><span class="nm">(a)</span><span class="cl">(Mishnah):</span> Ona'ah does not apply to the following: slaves, documents, land, and Hekdesh;</p>
<p class="bas indent1"><span class="nm">(b)</span>Also, one who steals them does not pay Kefel, four or five. A Shomer Chinam does not swear about them, and a Shomer Sachar does not pay (if they are lost or stolen);</p>
<p class="bas indent1"><span class="nm">(c)</span>R. Shimon says, Ona'ah applies to Kodshim with Achrayus (if this animal cannot be brought, the owner must bring another), but not to Kodshim without Achrayus.</p>
<p class="bas bbbline">56b----------------------------------------56b</p>
<p class="bas indent1"><span class="nm">(d)</span>R. Yehudah says, Ona'ah does not apply to a Sefer Torah, animal or pearl;</p>
<p class="bas indent1"><span class="nm">(e)</span>Chachamim say, it applies to everything except the above exceptions.</p>
<p class="bas indent1"><span class="nm">(f)</span><span class="cl">(Gemara) Question:</span> What is the source of the first law?</p>
<p class="bas indent1"><span class="nm">(g)</span><span class="cl">Answer (Beraisa):</span> The verse forbidding Ona'ah says "v'Chi Simkeru... <i>mi'Yad</i> Amisecha." It refers to something acquired from hand to hand;</p>
<p class="bas indent2"><span class="nm">1.</span>This excludes land, which cannot be moved. It excludes slaves, which are equated to land;</p>
<p class="bas indent2"><span class="nm">2.</span>It excludes documents, because "v'Chi Simkeru" connotes that the matter itself is sold. Documents are sold for the proof they contain (of a sale or loan).</p>
<p class="bas indent2"><span class="nm">3.</span>Therefore, one who sells documents to a perfumer (to cork his bottles), Ona'ah applies to them.</p>
<p class="bas indent3"><span class="nm">i.</span><span class="cl">Objection:</span> This is obvious!</p>
<p class="bas indent3"><span class="nm">ii.</span><span class="cl">Answer:</span> This teaches unlike Rav Kahana's opinion, that Ona'ah does not apply to Perutos (it applies only to at least an Isar). The Tana teaches that it is Ona'ah (presumably, the intrinsic value of documents is only Perutos).</p>
<p class="bas indent2"><span class="nm">4.</span>We exclude Hekdesh because the verse says "Achiv".</p>
<p class="bas indent1"><span class="nm">(h)</span><span class="cl">Question (Rabah bar Mamal):</span> Whenever the Torah says "Yado", does this literally mean 'hand'?!</p>
<p class="bas indent2"><span class="nm">1.</span>"Va'Yikach Es Kol Artzo mi'Yado" - we cannot say that Sichon's land was in his hand!</p>
<p class="bas indent2"><span class="nm">2.</span>Rather, it means from his possession. Also in the verse of selling, it means from his possession!</p>
<p class="bas indent2"><span class="nm">3.</span><span class="cl">Counter-question:</span> You cannot say that 'Yado' never literally means 'hand'! (Each of the coming two Beraisos shows this.)</p>
<p class="bas indent3"><span class="nm">i.</span><span class="cl">(Beraisa #1) Question:</span> It says "(if the stolen object will be found) b'Yado." What is the source to include his roof, yard or storage area?</p>
<p class="bas indent3"><span class="nm">ii.</span><span class="cl">Answer:</span> "Himatzei Simatzei" - the double expression comes to include them.</p>
<p class="bas indent3"><span class="nm">iii.</span>We expounded this way only because it says "Himatzei Simatzei." If not, we would have said that "Yado" literally means 'his hand'!</p>
<p class="bas indent3"><span class="nm">iv.</span><span class="cl">(Beraisa #2):</span> "(A husband puts the Get) b'Yadah." What is the source to include her roof, yard or storage area?</p>
<p class="bas indent3"><span class="nm">v.</span><span class="cl">Answer:</span> It says "v'Nasan" (and he will give, before it says "her hand"). This suggests that he can put it in other places as well).</p>
<p class="bas indent3"><span class="nm">vi.</span>We expounded this way only due to "v'Nasan." If not, we would have said that "Yado" always means 'his hand'!</p>
<p class="bas indent2"><span class="nm">4.</span><span class="cl">Answer:</span> Really, 'Yado' (almost) always means 'his hand'. We cannot say so regarding Sichon, so it must mean 'his possession'.</p>
<p class="bas indent1"><span class="nm">(i)</span><span class="cl">Question (R. Zeira):</span> Does Ona'ah apply to rental?</p>
<p class="bas indent2"><span class="nm">1.</span>The verse of Ona'ah discusses a sale, but not rental;</p>
<p class="bas indent2"><span class="nm">2.</span>Or, perhaps we do not distinguish!</p>
<p class="bas indent1"><span class="nm">(j)</span><span class="cl">Answer (Abaye):</span> The verse does not specify a permanent sale. Rental is a temporary sale (so Ona'ah applies to it).</p>
<p class="bas subject"><span class="nm">3)</span>ARE PLANTED <i>PEROS</i> LIKE LAND?</p>
<p class="bas indent1"><span class="nm">(a)</span><span class="cl">Question (Rava):</span> If one planted wheat in the ground, does Ona'ah apply?</p>
<p class="bas indent2"><span class="nm">1.</span>If we view it as being in a Kli, it is still Metaltelim, so there is Ona'ah;</p>
<p class="bas indent2"><span class="nm">2.</span>Or, since it will stay in the ground, perhaps it is like land (and there is no Ona'ah)!</p>
<p class="bas indent2"><span class="nm">3.</span><span class="cl">Question:</span> What is the case?</p>
<p class="bas indent3"><span class="nm">i.</span><span class="cl">Suggestion:</span> He says that he planted six measures of wheat, and witnesses say that he only planted five.</p>
<p class="bas indent3"><span class="nm">ii.</span><span class="cl">Rejection:</span> Rava taught that if one was shortchanged through an error in measure, weight or quantity, he is compensated, even if the error was less than the threshold of Ona'ah;</p>
<p class="bas indent2"><span class="nm">4.</span><span class="cl">Answer:</span> Rather, Reuven was told to plant wheat as needed, and he planted too little.</p>
<p class="bas indent3"><span class="nm">i.</span>If we view it as being in a Kli, it is still Metaltelim, there is Ona'ah;</p>
<p class="bas indent3"><span class="nm">ii.</span>Or ,since it will stay in the ground, is it like land?</p>
<p class="bas indent1"><span class="nm">(b)</span><span class="cl">Question:</span> Does one swear about it?</p>
<p class="bas indent2"><span class="nm">1.</span>If it is considered Metaltelim, he swears; if it is land, he does not.</p>
<p class="bas indent1"><span class="nm">(c)</span><span class="cl">Question:</span> (If the wheat was Chadash (i.e. from this year's harvest)) - is it permitted when the Omer offering is brought?</p>
<p class="bas indent2"><span class="nm">1.</span><span class="cl">Question:</span> What is the case? A Mishnah teaches the law if it took root, and if not!</p>
<p class="bas indent3"><span class="nm">i.</span><span class="cl">(Mishnah):</span> If it took root before the Omer, the Omer permits it; if not, it is permitted when the Omer is brought the next year.</p>
<p class="bas indent2"><span class="nm">2.</span><span class="cl">Answer:</span> The case is, he uprooted it and planted it before the Omer; the Omer passed before it took root. The question is, may he remove it and eat it?</p>
<p class="bas indent3"><span class="nm">i.</span>If we view it as being in a Kli, the Omer permits it;</p>
<p class="bas indent3"><span class="nm">ii.</span>If it is considered as part of the ground, the Omer does not permit it.</p>
<p class="bas indent1"><span class="nm">(d)</span>These questions are unsettled.</p>
