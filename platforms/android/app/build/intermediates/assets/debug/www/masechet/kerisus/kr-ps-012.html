<p class="bas subject"><span class="nm">1)</span>CHACHAMIM'S REASON</p>
<p class="bas indent1"><span class="nm">(a)</span><span class="cl">(Mishnah - R. Meir):</span> A Kal va'Chomer teaches this (if two witnesses can kill a man, all the more so they can be Mechayev him a Korban)!</p>
<p class="bas indent1"><span class="nm">(b)</span><span class="cl">Question:</span> What is Chachamim's reason?</p>
<p class="bas indent2"><span class="nm">1.</span>Do they say that one is believed about himself more than 100 witnesses (regarding atonement, for had he sinned, surely he would want to get a Kaparah)?</p>
<p class="bas indent2"><span class="nm">2.</span>Or, Migo (since) he could have exempted himself by saying "I ate b'Mezid", he is believed to say "I did not eat". (Tosfos - we interpret this to mean 'I did not eat b'Shogeg, rather, b'Mezid.')</p>
<p class="bas indent1"><span class="nm">(c)</span><span class="cl">Question:</span> What difference does it make which is the reason?</p>
<p class="bas indent1"><span class="nm">(d)</span><span class="cl">Answer:</span> This determines the law of Tum'ah. (Two witnesses say "you became Tamei and entered the Mikdash", and he says "I did not become Tamei";)</p>
<p class="bas indent2"><span class="nm">1.</span>If one is believed about himself more than 100 witnesses, this applies also to Tum'ah;</p>
<p class="bas indent2"><span class="nm">2.</span>If he is believed because of the Migo, Chachamim would exempt only regarding an old Tum'ah (this will be explained), but not regarding a new Tum'ah.</p>
<p class="bas indent2"><span class="nm">3.</span><span class="cl">Question:</span> What is the reason?</p>
<p class="bas indent2"><span class="nm">4.</span><span class="cl">Answer:</span> Regarding an old Tum'ah, we can explain, "I did not become Tamei" to mean, "I did not <i>remain</i> Tamei, rather, I immersed (and became fully Tahor before entering the Mikdash)";</p>
<p class="bas indent3"><span class="nm">i.</span>Regarding a new Tum'ah (e.g. the same day that he entered the Mikdash), we cannot explain this way. Even if he immersed before entering the Mikdash, he was still a Tevul Yom and is liable.</p>
<p class="bas indent1"><span class="nm">(e)</span><span class="cl">Answer #1 (to Question (b) - Beraisa):</span> If one witness told Ploni, "you became Tamei (and entered the Mikdash)", and he denies it, he is exempt;</p>
<p class="bas indent2"><span class="nm">1.</span><span class="cl">Suggestion:</span> Perhaps the same applies if two witnesses told him that he became Tamei!</p>
<p class="bas indent2"><span class="nm">2.</span><span class="cl">Rejection (R. Meir):</span> Two witnesses can cause a man to be killed. All the more so they can obligate him to bring a Korban!</p>
<p class="bas indent2"><span class="nm">3.</span><span class="cl">Chachamim:</span> No. One is believed about his own (Chiyuv to bring a Korban for) atonement more than 100 witnesses.</p>
<p class="bas indent2"><span class="nm">4.</span>This shows that Chachamim hold that one is believed about himself!</p>
<p class="bas indent1"><span class="nm">(f)</span><span class="cl">Rejection (R. Ami):</span> No. Chachamim exempt due to the Migo;</p>
<p class="bas indent2"><span class="nm">1.</span>Chachamim mean, because he could have said "I did not remain Tamei, rather, I immersed", he is believed about himself more than 100 witnesses.</p>
<p class="bas indent2"><span class="nm">2.</span><span class="cl">Question:</span> If so, this is just like Chelev! (Why was the same argument taught in a different case?)</p>
<p class="bas indent2"><span class="nm">3.</span><span class="cl">Answer:</span> One might have thought that "I did not eat" can be interpreted to mean, "I did not eat b'Shogeg, rather, b'Mezid" (for we merely add words), but we do not interpret "I did not become Tamei" to mean "I did not remain Tamei, rather, I immersed." The Beraisa teaches that we interpret even "I did not become Tamei."</p>
<p class="bas indent1"><span class="nm">(g)</span><span class="cl">Answer #2 (Beraisa):</span> "V'Hisvadah" teaches that only one who confesses brings a Korban;</p>
<p class="bas indent2"><span class="nm">1.</span>If one witness told Ploni "you became Tamei", and he denies it, he is exempt.</p>
<p class="bas indent2"><span class="nm">2.</span><span class="cl">Suggestion:</span> Perhaps the same applies if two witnesses told him that he became Tamei!</p>
<p class="bas indent2"><span class="nm">3.</span><span class="cl">Rejection (R. Meir):</span> Two witnesses can cause a man to be killed. All the more so they can obligate him to bring a Korban!</p>
<p class="bas indent2"><span class="nm">4.</span><span class="cl">R. Yehudah:</span> No. One is believed about himself more than 100 witnesses.</p>
<p class="bas indent2"><span class="nm">5.</span>Chachamim agree with R. Yehudah regarding Chelev and entering the Mikdash, but not regarding Tum'ah (a Tamei who touched Taharos).</p>
<p class="bas indent2"><span class="nm">6.</span><span class="cl">Question:</span> What is the case?</p>
<p class="bas bbbline">12b----------------------------------------12b</p>
<p class="bas indent3"><span class="nm">i.</span>If it is an old Tum'ah, Tum'ah is just like Chelev and Bi'as Mikdash. Just like Chachamim exempt the latter because he could have said "I was Mezid", regarding Tum'ah we can interpret his denial to mean "I did not remain Tamei, rather, I immersed"! (Rather, they argue about a new Tum'ah. R. Yehudah exempts, for he holds that one is believed about himself. Chachamim argue, for they hold that he is believed only due to the Migo! Rashi - Chachamim of the Beraisa are Chachamim of our Mishnah; Tosfos - R. Yehudah is like Chachamim of our Mishnah.)</p>
<p class="bas indent1"><span class="nm">(h)</span><span class="cl">Rejection (Ravina):</span> Really, it refers to an old Tum'ah;</p>
<p class="bas indent2"><span class="nm">1.</span><span class="cl">Version #1 (Rashi):</span> The case is, the witnesses said that he ate Kodshim b'Tum'ah, and he said that he did not become Tamei. Chachamim do not interpret this to mean "I did not remain Tamei, rather, I immersed", for this is unlike his actual words;</p>
<p class="bas indent2"><span class="nm">2.</span>"I did not become Tamei", implies that he did not eat Kodshim b'Tum'ah, and was not Metamei the meat (through touching it when Tamei). If we interpret his denial, i.e. only to exempt himself from the Korban (for eating b'Tum'ah), this is like admission that he was Metamei the meat!</p>
<p class="bas indent2"><span class="nm">3.</span><span class="cl">Version #2 (Rashi):</span> Chachamim believe him only regarding Kaparah, i.e. Chelev and Bi'as Mikdash (for which one brings a Korban), but not regarding touching.</p>
<p class="bas indent2"><span class="nm">4.</span><span class="cl">Version #3 (Tosfos):</span> Both R. Yehudah and Chachamim believe him only when we can interpret his words;</p>
<p class="bas indent3"><span class="nm">i.</span>Chachamim interpret "I did not eat" to mean "I did not eat b'Shogeg, rather, b'Mezid", for this does not contradict what he said. We do not interpret "I did not become Tamei" to mean "I did not remain Tamei, rather, I immersed", for he said that he did not become Tamei at all.</p>
<p class="bas indent1"><span class="nm">(i)</span><span class="cl">(Rav Nachman):</span> The Halachah follows R. Yehudah.</p>
<p class="bas indent1"><span class="nm">(j)</span><span class="cl">(Rav Yosef):</span> (If witnesses said that Ploni was Metamei Taharos and he denies it,) R. Yehudah permits only Ploni to eat them (as if they are Tahor) himself, in private, lest others will be lax about Taharos.</p>
<p class="bas indent1"><span class="nm">(k)</span><span class="cl">(Reish Lakish):</span> R. Meir agrees that if Ploni contradicts witnesses who say that he had relations with a Shifchah Charufah, he is believed, because he could have said that he was not Gomer (therefore, he is exempt. Surely, witnesses did not look so closely to see whether or not he was Gomer. Acharonim say that she cannot claim 'he did not finish the Bi'ah' to exempt herself from lashes, for there is a Chazakah that since she accepted warning for lashes, they finished the Bi'ah, or because she is lashed even for Ha'ara'ah due to Kedeshah (the Isur of any Shifchah to a Yisrael). See Teshuvas Chasam Sofer (4:103) and Or Some'ach Hilchos Isurei Bi'ah 1:19.)</p>
<p class="bas indent1"><span class="nm">(l)</span><span class="cl">(Rav Sheshes):</span> R. Meir agrees that if a Nazir contradicts witnesses who say that he became Tamei, he is believed, because he could have said that he annulled his vow to be a Nazir.</p>
<p class="bas indent1"><span class="nm">(m)</span><span class="cl">(Abaye):</span> R. Meir agrees that if one contradicts witnesses who say that (his Shevu'as ha'Edus was false, because) he knew a certain testimony, he is believed, because he could have said that when he saw the event, he did not intend to testify (later. Shitah asks that most testimony does not require that one intended to testify at the time he saw it! Tosfos learns from here that all testimony requires intent from the beginning. Mahari - he could have said that he forgot the testimony (he was not careful to remember it, because he did not plan to testify).)</p>
<p class="bas subject"><span class="nm">2)</span>CHILUK HA'ALAMOS</p>
<p class="bas indent1"><span class="nm">(a)</span><span class="cl">(Mishnah):</span> If one ate Chelev twice in one He'elem (he is liable only once).</p>
<p class="bas indent1"><span class="nm">(b)</span><span class="cl">Version #1 Question (R. Zeira):</span> Why is he is liable only once? He ate two k'Zeisim!</p>
<p class="bas indent1"><span class="nm">(c)</span><span class="cl">Answer (Abaye):</span> Ha'alamos are Mechalek. Here, it was all in one He'elem, so he brings only one Korban.</p>
<p class="bas indent1"><span class="nm">(d)</span><span class="cl">Version #2 - Inference:</span> Had he eaten in two Ha'alamos, he would be liable twice.</p>
<p class="bas indent2"><span class="nm">1.</span><span class="cl">Question:</span> Why should he be liable twice for one (Shem) Isur?</p>
<p class="bas indent2"><span class="nm">2.</span><span class="cl">Answer (Abaye):</span> Ha'alamos are Mechalek.</p>
<p class="bas indent1"><span class="nm">(e)</span><span class="cl">Version #1 (Mishnah):</span> If he ate Chelev, blood, Pigul, and Nosar... (if one ate two half-k'Zeisim of the same Min (Isur) in one He'elem, he is liable).</p>
<p class="bas indent1"><span class="nm">(f)</span><span class="cl">Objection:</span> This is obvious!</p>
<p class="bas indent1"><span class="nm">(g)</span><span class="cl">Answer (Reish Lakish):</span> The case is, he ate from two different plates. It is like R. Yehoshua, who says that plates are Mechalek. (If one Isur was cooked in different plates, each plate is considered a different Min);</p>
<p class="bas indent2"><span class="nm">1.</span>One might have thought that R. Yehoshua says this to be stringent (if he ate a k'Zayis from each plate in one He'elem, it is as if he ate different Minim, he brings a Korban for each) and to be lenient (when he ate a half-k'Zayis from each, they are like different Minim and do not join). The Mishnah teaches that this is not so. He says this only to be stringent.</p>
<p class="bas indent1"><span class="nm">(h)</span><span class="cl">Version #2 (Seifa):</span> If the half-k'Zeisim were of two Minim, he is exempt.</p>
<p class="bas indent1"><span class="nm">(i)</span><span class="cl">Objection:</span> This is obvious!</p>
<p class="bas indent1"><span class="nm">(j)</span><span class="cl">Answer (Reish Lakish):</span> The case is, he ate from two different plates. It is like R. Yehoshua, who says that plates are Mechalek;</p>
<p class="bas indent2"><span class="nm">1.</span>One might have thought that R. Yehoshua says this only to be stringent, but not to be lenient. The Mishnah teaches that this is not so.</p>
<p class="bas indent2"><span class="nm">2.</span><span class="cl">Question:</span> What is the meaning of "two Minim"?</p>
<p class="bas indent2"><span class="nm">3.</span><span class="cl">Answer:</span> It is one Min (kind of Isur). It is called two because they were in two different plates;</p>
<p class="bas indent3"><span class="nm">i.</span>This shows that R. Yehoshua holds that plates are Mechalek, even to be lenient.</p>
<p class="bas indent1"><span class="nm">(k)</span><span class="cl">Question:</span> If the Seifa discusses one Min in two plates, the Reisha must discuss one Min in one plate. Obviously, he is liable!</p>
<p class="bas indent1"><span class="nm">(l)</span><span class="cl">Answer (Ravina):</span> The case is, he found out in the middle (after eating a half-k'Zayis). The Mishnah is like R. Gamliel, who says Ein Yedi'ah l'Chatzi Shi'ur (finding out that he ate a half-Shi'ur does not prevent what he eats later (b'Shogeg) from joining to complete the Shi'ur);</p>
<p class="bas indent2"><span class="nm">1.</span><span class="cl">(Mishnah - R. Gamliel):</span> If (on Shabbos) one wrote two letters (in all, the Shi'ur to be liable for writing) in two Ha'alamos, one in the morning and one in the afternoon, he is liable;</p>
<p class="bas indent2"><span class="nm">2.</span>Chachamim exempt.</p>
<p class="bas indent2"><span class="nm">3.</span>R. Gamliel holds Ein Yedi'ah l'Chatzi Shi'ur. Chachamim hold Yesh Yedi'ah l'Chatzi Shi'ur (what he writes later is a separate He'elem. It does not join to complete the Shi'ur.)</p>
<p class="bas subject"><span class="nm">3)</span>THE DURATION IN WHICH <i>ISURIM</i> ARE EATEN</p>
<p class="bas indent1"><span class="nm">(a)</span><span class="cl">(Mishnah) Question:</span> How long can one delay while eating (Isur, and still be liable)?</p>
<p class="bas indent1"><span class="nm">(b)</span><span class="cl">Answer #1 (R. Meir):</span> He can delay like one who eats crumbs (of parched grain);</p>
<p class="bas indent1"><span class="nm">(c)</span><span class="cl">Answer #2 (Chachamim):</span> (He is liable) only if the delay from beginning to end was bi'Chdei Achilas Pras (within the time needed to eat half a standard loaf (Rashi - the size of eight eggs; Rambam - of six eggs). (Mid'Rabanan, if one ate a quarter loaf of Tamei food or drank a Revi'is of Tamei liquids, he becomes Tamei, and he may not eat Terumah until he immerses. This is a decree lest one put Terumah in his mouth while there is Tamei food inside.)</p>
<p class="bas indent1"><span class="nm">(d)</span><span class="cl">Version #1 (Rashi):</span> If one ate (a quarter loaf of) Tamei food, drank (a Revi'is of) Tamei liquids, if the delay was bi'Chdei Achilas Pras, (he became Tamei);</p>
<p class="bas indent2"><span class="nm">1.</span>If one drank a Revi'is of wine within this time and entered the Mikdash, he is liable.</p>
<p class="bas indent1"><span class="nm">(e)</span><span class="cl">Version #2 (in Shitah Mekubetzes 12):</span> If one ate (a quarter loaf of) Tamei food, drank (a Revi'is of) Tamei liquids, or drank a Revi'is of wine and entered the Mikdash:</p>
<p class="bas indent2"><span class="nm">1.</span>If the delay was bi'Chdei Achilas Pras, he is liable (mid'Oraisa for wine, and mid'Rabanan if he consumed Tamei food or drink).</p>
<p class="bas indent1"><span class="nm">(f)</span>R. Eliezer says, if he paused while drinking the wine, or added any water to it, he is exempt.</p>
<p class="bas indent1"><span class="nm">(g)</span><span class="cl">(Gemara) Question:</span> Is R. Meir more lenient than Chachamim, or more stringent?</p>
<p class="bas indent2"><span class="nm">1.</span>Does he mean that he can delay all day, like one who eats crumbs, even if the total time (Rambam; Rashi - the time between eatings) exceeds Kedei Achilas Pras? This is a stringency;</p>
<p class="bas indent3"><span class="nm">i.</span>Chachamim reply that he is not liable unless he ate bi'Chdei Achilas Pras.</p>
<p class="bas indent2"><span class="nm">2.</span>Or does he mean that he must eat without pausing, like one who eats crumbs, but if he paused he is exempt, even though he ate a Shi'ur within Kedei Achilas Pras. This is a leniency;</p>
<p class="bas indent3"><span class="nm">i.</span>Chachamim reply that since he delayed at most Kedei Achilas Pras from beginning to end, he is liable.</p>
