<p class="bas indent1"><span class="nm">(a)</span><span class="cl">Resolution #2 (Rav Sheshes):</span> Beraisa #2 teaches that one does not transgress (for delaying) Pidyon Peter Chamor until 30 days.</p>
<p class="bas indent1"><span class="nm">(b)</span><span class="cl">Question (Rami bar Chama - Beraisa):</span> The Mitzvah (of Pidyon Peter Chamor) is all 30 days. After this, he redeems it or does Arifah.</p>
<p class="bas indent2"><span class="nm">1.</span><span class="cl">Suggestion:</span> This means that the Mitzvah is to wait 30 days before redeeming!</p>
<p class="bas indent1"><span class="nm">(c)</span><span class="cl">Answer:</span> No, it means that for the first 30 days the Mitzvah is to redeem.</p>
<p class="bas indent1"><span class="nm">(d)</span><span class="cl">Objection:</span> If so, it should not say "after this, he redeems it or does Arifah," rather, "after this, he redeems it or transgresses"!</p>
<p class="bas indent1"><span class="nm">(e)</span><span class="cl">Resolution #3 (Rava):</span> Beraisa #1 is like R. Eliezer, who equates Pidyon Peter Chamor to Pidyon ha'Ben. Beraisa #2 is like Chachamim, who do not equate them.</p>
<p class="bas subject"><span class="nm">2)</span>PREFERABLE <i>MITZVOS</i></p>
<p class="bas indent1"><span class="nm">(a)</span><span class="cl">(Mishnah):</span> If the owner of a Peter Chamor (or a Kohen who received one) does not want to redeem it, he does Arifah from the back of the neck and buries it;</p>
<p class="bas indent2"><span class="nm">1.</span>The Mitzvah to redeem it takes precedence over Mitzvas Arifah - "v'Im Lo Sifdeh va'Arafto";</p>
<p class="bas indent1"><span class="nm">(b)</span>The Mitzvah (for an Amah Ivriyah's master) to do Yi'ud (marry her) takes precedence over the Mitzvah (for her or her father) to redeem her(self) - "Asher Lo Ye'Adah v'Hefdah."</p>
<p class="bas indent1"><span class="nm">(c)</span>At first, people would do Yibum l'Shem Mitzvah, so it had precedence over Chalitzah;</p>
<p class="bas indent2"><span class="nm">1.</span>Nowadays, people are not l'Shem Mitzvah (such a Yibum is like Arayos, i.e. Eshes Ach), so Chalitzah takes precedence.</p>
<p class="bas indent1"><span class="nm">(d)</span>If one was Makdish (to Bedek ha'Bayis), he has precedence to redeem over anyone else (R. Gershom - because he adds a Chomesh - "v'Yasaf Chamishiso Alav), v'Im Lo Yiga'el v'Nimchar b'Erkecha."</p>

<p class="bas indent1"><span class="nm">(a)</span><span class="cl">(Mishnah):</span> In the following cases, a cow's first calf does not get Kedushas Bechor:</p>
<p class="bas indent2"><span class="nm">1.</span>If one bought the fetus in a Nochri's cow;</p>
<p class="bas indent2"><span class="nm">2.</span>If one sold the fetus in his cow to a Nochri, even though this is forbidden;</p>
<p class="bas indent2"><span class="nm">3.</span>If one was a partner with a Nochri in a cow;</p>
<p class="bas indent2"><span class="nm">4.</span>If one was Mekabel from a Nochri (to take care of his cow, and share the offspring), or he gave his cow to a Nochri b'Kabalah.</p>
<p class="bas indent1"><span class="nm">(b)</span>We learn from "b'Yisrael", but not of others.</p>
<p class="bas indent1"><span class="nm">(c)</span>Kedushas Bechor applies to Tahor animals born to Kohanim and Leviyim;</p>
<p class="bas indent2"><span class="nm">1.</span>They are exempt only from Pidyon ha'Ben and Kedushas Peter Chamor.</p>
<p class="bas indent1"><span class="nm">(d)</span><span class="cl">(Gemara) Question:</span> Why does our Masechta begin with Peter Chamor, and only afterwards it discusses Bechor Behemah Tehorah?</p>
<p class="bas indent2"><span class="nm">1.</span>It would be is more reasonable to begin with Kedushas ha'Guf, and then to teach about Kedushas Damim!</p>
<p class="bas indent1"><span class="nm">(e)</span><span class="cl">Answer #1 (Chachamim of Eretz Yisrael):</span> The Tana prefers to teach about donkeys first, due to R. Chanina's teaching. (It is the only Tamei species with Kedushas Bechor because donkeys helped Bnei Yisrael take wealth out of Mitzrayim.)</p>
<p class="bas indent1"><span class="nm">(f)</span><span class="cl">Answer #2:</span> Because there are fewer laws of Peter Chamor, the Tana immediately taught them in the first Perek, and teaches about Bechor Behemah Tehorah in (most of) the rest of the Masechta.</p>

<p class="bas indent1"><span class="nm">(a)</span><span class="cl">(Reish Lakish citing R. Oshaya):</span> If a Yisrael gave money to a Nochri for his Behemah, we follow their law (this will be explained). Even though the Yisrael did not do Meshichah (take it to his Reshus), he acquired it, and Kedushas Bechor applies to it;</p>
<p class="bas indent2"><span class="nm">1.</span>If a Nochri gave money to a Yisrael for his Behemah, we follow their law (this will be explained). Even though he did not do Meshichah, he acquired it, and it is exempt from Bechorah.</p>
<p class="bas indent1"><span class="nm">(b)</span><span class="cl">Question:</span> What is the meaning of (in the Reisha) "We follow their law"?</p>
<p class="bas indent2"><span class="nm">1.</span><span class="cl">Suggestion:</span> We learn from the law of buying a Nochri (slave);</p>
<p class="bas indent3"><span class="nm">i.</span>A Yisrael acquires a Nochri through money. Slaves are called "Lareshes Achuzah" (an inheritance). They are equated to land;</p>
<p class="bas indent3"><span class="nm">ii.</span>Just like land is acquired through money, a document or Chazakah (usage), also an Eved Kena'ani.</p>
<p class="bas indent2"><span class="nm">2.</span>Money acquires a Nochri. All the more so it acquires his property!</p>
<p class="bas indent2"><span class="nm">3.</span><span class="cl">Rejection #1:</span> The same reasoning would show that documents and Chazakah acquire his property (but this is not true)!</p>
<p class="bas indent2"><span class="nm">4.</span><span class="cl">Rejection #2:</span> A similar Kal va'Chomer should apply to Yisraelim, but the resulting law is not true! (This shows that we may not make such a Kal va'Chomer.)</p>
<p class="bas indent3"><span class="nm">i.</span>Reuven acquires Shimon (to be his Eved Ivri) through money, but he does not acquire Shimon's Metaltelim through money, only through Meshichah! (In the following discussion, unspecified Kinyan is of Metaltelim.)</p>
<p class="bas indent1"><span class="nm">(c)</span><span class="cl">Answer #1 (Abaye):</span> We follow the law that the Torah gave for Nochrim:</p>
<p class="bas indent2"><span class="nm">1.</span>A Yisrael acquires through Meshichah "mi'Yad Amisecha" -- from (the hand of) another Yisrael. He does not acquire from a Nochri through Meshichah, rather, through money.</p>
<p class="bas indent2"><span class="nm">2.</span><span class="cl">Suggestion:</span> Perhaps he does not acquire from a Nochri at all (R. Gershom; Rashi - until he actually takes it to his premises. When acquiring from a Yisrael, it suffices to take it to his Reshus (or to a place where he may stop), e.g. totally in his hand, three Tefachim off the ground (Hagbahah), or to a shoulder of Reshus ha'Rabim.)</p>
<p class="bas indent2"><span class="nm">3.</span><span class="cl">Rejection:</span> Money acquires (Tosfos - an Eved Ivri for) a Nochri. All the more so money acquires his property! (I.e. and since a Nochri acquires a Yisrael's property through money, all the more so a Yisrael acquires a Nochri's property through money.)</p>
<p class="bas indent2"><span class="nm">4.</span><span class="cl">Suggestion:</span> Perhaps he does not acquire until he gives money <i>and</i> does Meshichah!</p>
<p class="bas indent2"><span class="nm">5.</span><span class="cl">Rejection:</span> One Kinyan (money) suffices to acquire his body (to be a slave). All the more so one Kinyan suffices to acquire his property!</p>

<p class="bas indent2"><span class="nm">7.</span><span class="cl">Rejection:</span> This is (learned from and similar to) a Yisrael who acquires from a Yisrael;</p>
<p class="bas indent3"><span class="nm">i.</span>Just like there is one Kinyan for a Yisrael to acquire from a Yisrael, also for a Nochri.</p>
<p class="bas indent1"><span class="nm">(d)</span><span class="cl">(Reish Lakish):</span> If a Nochri gave money for a Yisrael's animal, we follow their law. He acquires without Meshichah, and it is exempt from Bechorah.</p>
<p class="bas indent1"><span class="nm">(e)</span><span class="cl">Question:</span> What is the meaning of "their law"?</p>
<p class="bas indent2"><span class="nm">1.</span><span class="cl">Suggestion:</span> We learn from the law of a Nochri who buys an Eved Ivri;</p>
<p class="bas indent3"><span class="nm">i.</span>A Nochri acquires a Yisrael through money, "mi'Kesef Miknaso." All the more so he acquires a Yisrael's property through money!</p>

<p class="bas indent3"><span class="nm">i.</span>Reuven acquires Shimon through money, but he does not acquire Shimon's Metaltelim through money, only through Meshichah!</p>
<p class="bas indent1"><span class="nm">(f)</span><span class="cl">Answer #1 (Abaye):</span> We follow the law that the Torah gave for Nochrim:</p>
<p class="bas indent2"><span class="nm">1.</span>"V'Chi Simkero Mimkar la'Amisecha (... mi'Yad Amisecha)" teaches that a Yisrael is Makneh (transfers ownership) to a Yisrael through Meshichah (of the buyer), but he is not Makneh to a Nochri through Meshichah, rather, through (receiving) money.</p>
<p class="bas indent2"><span class="nm">2.</span><span class="cl">Suggestion:</span> Perhaps he is not Makneh to a Nochri at all!</p>

<p class="bas bbbline">13b----------------------------------------13b</p>
<p class="bas indent2"><span class="nm">7.</span><span class="cl">Rejection:</span> Just like there is one Kinyan to be Makneh to a Yisrael, also to a Nochri.</p>
<p class="bas indent1"><span class="nm">(g)</span>Ameimar says that a Nochri acquires and is Makneh through Meshichah.</p>
<p class="bas indent1"><span class="nm">(h)</span><span class="cl">Question:</span> We understand this if he holds like R. Yochanan, who says that mid'Oraisa a Yisrael acquires through money (but Chachamim disqualified money and enacted that Meshichah acquires). "Amisecha" teaches that money works for a Yisrael, but not for a Nochri, rather, Meshichah;</p>
<p class="bas indent2"><span class="nm">1.</span>If he holds like Reish Lakish, who says that mid'Oraisa a Yisrael acquires through Meshichah, just like a Nochri, how does he expound "Amisecha"?</p>
<p class="bas indent1"><span class="nm">(i)</span><span class="cl">Answer:</span> (The verse discusses Ona'ah (overcharging) -- "v'Chi Simkero Mimkar la'Amisecha Oh Kano mi'Yad Amisecha Al Tonu.") "Amisecha" teaches that Ona'ah must be returned to a Yisrael, but not to a Nochri. (Rashash - however, one may not overcharge him.)</p>
<p class="bas indent1"><span class="nm">(j)</span><span class="cl">Question:</span> We learn this from the end of the verse, "Al Tonu <i>Ish Es Achiv</i>"!</p>
<p class="bas indent1"><span class="nm">(k)</span><span class="cl">Answer:</span> One of these excludes Ona'ah of a Nochri, and one excludes Ona'ah of Hekdesh. The Torah needed to teach both:</p>
<p class="bas indent2"><span class="nm">1.</span>Had it taught only about Ona'ah of a Nochri, we would have thought that Ona'ah applies to Hekdesh. Therefore, both are needed.</p>
<p class="bas indent1"><span class="nm">(l)</span><span class="cl">Question:</span> This is like the opinion that forbids stealing from Nochrim;</p>
<p class="bas indent2"><span class="nm">1.</span>According to the opinion that permits, there is no need to teach that Ona'ah does not apply to Nochrim!</p>
<p class="bas indent1"><span class="nm">(m)</span><span class="cl">Answer:</span> Indeed, if Ameimar permits Gezel Nochri, he must hold like R. Yochanan.</p>
<p class="bas subject"><span class="nm">5)</span>RETRACTING FROM A PURCHASE FROM A <i>NOCHRI</i></p>
<p class="bas indent1"><span class="nm">(a)</span><span class="cl">Question (Beraisa):</span> If a Yisrael bought pieces of silver from a Nochri, and found idolatry among them:</p>
<p class="bas indent2"><span class="nm">1.</span>If he did Meshichah but did not yet give the money, he can return it;</p>
<p class="bas indent2"><span class="nm">2.</span>If he did Meshichah after giving the money, he must cast the idolatry to the Dead Sea. (He acquired it, and one may not benefit from idolatry.)</p>
<p class="bas indent3"><span class="nm">i.</span>If money acquires from Nochrim, why does the Seifa mention Meshichah? He acquired through money alone!</p>
<p class="bas indent1"><span class="nm">(b)</span><span class="cl">Answer #1:</span> The case is, the Nochri agreed to conduct according to the law of Yisrael. (Only Meshichah acquires.)</p>
<p class="bas indent1"><span class="nm">(c)</span><span class="cl">Question:</span> If so, why does the Beraisa discuss giving money?</p>
<p class="bas indent1"><span class="nm">(d)</span><span class="cl">Answer:</span> It teaches that even though he gave money, if he did not do Meshichah, he may return it.</p>
<p class="bas indent1"><span class="nm">(e)</span><span class="cl">Question:</span> Also in the Reisha, he did Meshichah. Why may he return it?</p>
<p class="bas indent1"><span class="nm">(f)</span><span class="cl">Answer #1 (Abaye):</span> It is a Mekach Ta'us (mistaken sale. He never intended to buy idolatry, so he never acquired it).</p>
<p class="bas indent1"><span class="nm">(g)</span><span class="cl">Objection (Rava):</span> Also in the Seifa, it is a Mekach Ta'us, yet he may not return it!</p>
<p class="bas indent1"><span class="nm">(h)</span><span class="cl">Answer #1 (and Answer #2 to Question (e) - Rava):</span> In both clauses it is a Mekach Ta'us;</p>
<p class="bas indent2"><span class="nm">1.</span>In the Reisha, he did not give money, so it does not look like a Yisrael's idolatry;</p>
<p class="bas indent2"><span class="nm">2.</span>In the Seifa, he gave money, so it <i>looks like</i> a Yisrael's idolatry.</p>
<p class="bas indent1"><span class="nm">(i)</span><span class="cl">Answer #2 (Abaye):</span> In the Reisha it is a Mekach Ta'us. Since he did not give money, it is understandable that he did not know that there is idolatry among them;</p>
<p class="bas indent2"><span class="nm">1.</span>In the Seifa he gave money. He should have examined them before doing Meshichah. Since he did not do so, he accepted whatever is there!</p>
<p class="bas indent1"><span class="nm">(j)</span><span class="cl">Answer #2 (to question (a) - Rav Ashi):</span> The Reisha shows that Meshichah does not acquire, therefore also in the Seifa it does not acquire;</p>
<p class="bas indent2"><span class="nm">1.</span>Really, the Seifa need not mention Meshichah. It is only for parallel structure with the Reisha.</p>
<p class="bas indent1"><span class="nm">(k)</span><span class="cl">Answer #3 (Ravina):</span> The Seifa shows that Meshichah acquires, therefore also in the Reisha it acquires;</p>
<p class="bas indent2"><span class="nm">1.</span>The Reisha means, if he did not give money <i>nor</i> do Meshichah, he can return it.</p>
<p class="bas indent1"><span class="nm">(l)</span><span class="cl">Question:</span> If he did neither Kinyan, there is nothing to return!</p>
<p class="bas indent1"><span class="nm">(m)</span><span class="cl">Answer:</span> He may retract his words;</p>
<p class="bas indent2"><span class="nm">1.</span>The Tana holds that one who retracts from verbal commitments <i>to a Yisrael</i> is unfaithful, for a Yisrael honors his word;</p>
<p class="bas indent2"><span class="nm">2.</span>Since a Nochri does not honor his word, a Yisrael need not honor his word to a Nochri.</p>
