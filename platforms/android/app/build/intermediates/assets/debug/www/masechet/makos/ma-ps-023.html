<p class="bas subject"><span class="nm">1)</span>TEACHINGS OF RAV SHESHES IN THE NAME OF R. ELAZAR BEN AZARYAH</p>
<p class="bas indent1"><span class="nm">(a)</span><span class="cl">(Gemara):</span> (The reason (we tie him to a post, or tear his garments) is "v'Nikleh (he is humiliated)" - Bach deletes this from the text.)</p>
<p class="bas indent1"><span class="nm">(b)</span><span class="cl">Question (Rav Sheshes):</span> What is the source that the whip should be from a calf?</p>
<p class="bas indent1"><span class="nm">(c)</span><span class="cl">Answer:</span> Right after "Arba'im Yakenu" it says "Lo Sachsom Shor b'Disho."</p>
<p class="bas indent1"><span class="nm">(d)</span><span class="cl">Question (Rav Sheshes):</span> What is the source that if a Yavam is leprous, the Yevamah may demand Chalitzah?</p>
<p class="bas indent1"><span class="nm">(e)</span><span class="cl">Answer:</span> The Parshah of Yibum is right after "Lo Sachsom Shor b'Disho" (do not suppress her claim).</p>
<p class="bas indent1"><span class="nm">(f)</span><span class="cl">(Rav Sheshes):</span> One who disgraces the festivals (Rivan, Rashi on Avos - he works on Chol ha'Mo'ed; Rambam - does not honor Yom Tov) is like one who serves idolatry. Right after "Elohei Masechah Lo Sa'aseh Lecha" it says "Es Chag ha'Matzos Tishmor."</p>
<p class="bas indent1"><span class="nm">(g)</span><span class="cl">(Rav Sheshes):</span> One who speaks or believes Lashon ha'Ra or testifies falsely should be cast to dogs. Right after "la'Kelev Tashlichun Oso", it says "Lo Sisa Shema Shav."</p>
<p class="bas subject"><span class="nm">2)</span>THE WHIP USED FOR LASHING</p>
<p class="bas indent1"><span class="nm">(a)</span><span class="cl">(Mishnah):</span> Two straps...</p>
<p class="bas indent1"><span class="nm">(b)</span><span class="cl">(Beraisa):</span> The straps are of donkey skin.</p>
<p class="bas indent1"><span class="nm">(c)</span><span class="cl">A man of Galil:</span> "Yada Shor Konehu v'Chamor Evus B'alav Yisrael Lo Yada" - a sinner, who does not recognize his Master's feeding trough, will be chastised through a donkey, which recognizes its master's feeding trough.</p>
<p class="bas indent1"><span class="nm">(d)</span><span class="cl">(Mishnah):</span> The whip handle is a Tefach... (the end reaches Reuven's stomach).</p>
<p class="bas indent1"><span class="nm">(e)</span><span class="cl">(Abaye):</span> This teaches that we make a whip for each person lashed (so it will be the right size).</p>
<p class="bas indent1"><span class="nm">(f)</span><span class="cl">Objection (Rava):</span> If so, Beis Din will have many whips!</p>
<p class="bas indent1"><span class="nm">(g)</span><span class="cl">(Rava):</span> Rather, it has loops to adjust the size.</p>
<p class="bas indent1"><span class="nm">(h)</span><span class="cl">(Mishnah):</span> One third of the lashes...</p>
<p class="bas indent1"><span class="nm">(i)</span><span class="cl">Question:</span> What is the source of this?</p>
<p class="bas indent1"><span class="nm">(j)</span><span class="cl">Answer (Rav Kahana):</span> "V'Hikahu Lefanav Kedei Rish'aso b'Mispar" - in front, he is lashed according to his evil (but in back he is lashed more, i.e. twice as much, this is the smallest Chidush - Rashi on Chumash, according to Mizrachi).</p>
<p class="bas indent1"><span class="nm">(k)</span><span class="cl">(Mishnah):</span> He is not lashed standing...</p>
<p class="bas indent1"><span class="nm">(l)</span><span class="cl">(Rav Chisda):</span> "V'Hipilu" is the source to fold the whip.</p>
<p class="bas indent1"><span class="nm">(m)</span><span class="cl">Question:</span> We need this to teach that he is whipped leaning!</p>
<p class="bas indent1"><span class="nm">(n)</span><span class="cl">Answer:</span> Had it said 'Yatehu', we would learn only that he is whipped leaning;</p>
<p class="bas indent2"><span class="nm">1.</span>Instead it says "v'Hipilu" (we read this as if it said 'v'Hichpilu (he will double over)' - Yerushalmi).</p>
<p class="bas subject"><span class="nm">3)</span>THE WHIPPING</p>
<p class="bas indent1"><span class="nm">(a)</span><span class="cl">(Mishnah):</span> He lashes with one hand...</p>
<p class="bas indent1"><span class="nm">(b)</span><span class="cl">(Beraisa):</span> We pick only a weak person with intelligence to lash;</p>
<p class="bas indent1"><span class="nm">(c)</span>R. Yehudah says, we may even pick a strong person lacking intelligence.</p>
<p class="bas indent1"><span class="nm">(d)</span><span class="cl">(Rava):</span> Presumably, the Halachah follows R. Yehudah, for it says "Lo Yosif Pen Yosif";</p>
<p class="bas indent2"><span class="nm">1.</span>An intelligent person would not need to be warned!</p>
<p class="bas indent1"><span class="nm">(e)</span><span class="cl">Rejection:</span> Chachamim's opinion is reasonable. We warn only the zealous (for they will heed it)!</p>
<p class="bas indent1"><span class="nm">(f)</span><span class="cl">(Beraisa):</span> He lifts the whip with two hands, and lashes with one hand (in order to lash strongly).</p>
<p class="bas indent1"><span class="nm">(g)</span><span class="cl">(Mishnah):</span> Another reads ("Im Lo...")</p>
<p class="bas indent1"><span class="nm">(h)</span><span class="cl">(Beraisa):</span> The greatest judge reads, the next greatest counts, and the third says 'lash him!';</p>
<p class="bas indent2"><span class="nm">1.</span>If many lashes will be given, he reads slowly (so he will not finish before the lashes are finished). If few lashes will be given, he reads quickly.</p>
<p class="bas indent1"><span class="nm">(i)</span><span class="cl">Contradiction (Mishnah):</span> He repeats the verse (if he finishes first)!</p>
<p class="bas indent1"><span class="nm">(j)</span><span class="cl">Resolution:</span> L'Chatchilah, he should try to finish at the same time. B'Di'eved, he repeats the verse.</p>
<p class="bas indent1"><span class="nm">(k)</span><span class="cl">(Beraisa) Question:</span> The verse forbids giving an extra "Makah Rabah" (a great blow). What is the source to forbid even a light blow?</p>
<p class="bas indent1"><span class="nm">(l)</span><span class="cl">Answer:</span> We learn from "Lo Yosif."</p>
<p class="bas indent1"><span class="nm">(m)</span><span class="cl">Question:</span> If so, why do we need "Makah Rabah"</p>
<p class="bas indent1"><span class="nm">(n)</span><span class="cl">Answer:</span> This teaches that the previous lashes are mighty.</p>
<p class="bas subject"><span class="nm">4)</span>DISGRACE EXEMPTS FROM LASHES</p>
<p class="bas indent1"><span class="nm">(a)</span><span class="cl">(Mishnah):</span> If Reuven urinated...</p>
<p class="bas indent1"><span class="nm">(b)</span><span class="cl">(Beraisa - R. Meir):</span> If a man or woman excreted, he or she is exempt, but not if he or she urinated;</p>
<p class="bas indent2"><span class="nm">1.</span>R. Yehudah says, a man is exempt (only) if he excreted. A woman is exempt (even) if she urinated;</p>
<p class="bas indent2"><span class="nm">2.</span>Chachamim say, a man or woman is exempt if he or she excreted or urinated.</p>
<p class="bas indent1"><span class="nm">(c)</span><span class="cl">Contradiction (Beraisa - R. Yehudah):</span> A man and woman are the same if they excreted (this exempts).</p>
<p class="bas indent1"><span class="nm">(d)</span><span class="cl">Resolution (Rav Nachman):</span> They are the same if they excreted, but not if they urinated.</p>
<p class="bas indent1"><span class="nm">(e)</span><span class="cl">(Shmuel):</span> If he was tied to be lashed and fled, he is exempt (he was humiliated).</p>
<p class="bas indent1"><span class="nm">(f)</span><span class="cl">Question (Beraisa):</span> If he excreted, whether on the first or second time (Rambam - he was sentenced for two sets of lashes; Ritva - the first or second lash; Rivan - the first or second time the overseer raised his hand in order to lash), he is exempt;</p>
<p class="bas indent2"><span class="nm">1.</span>If the whip broke the second time, he is exempt, but not if it broke the first time.</p>
<p class="bas indent2"><span class="nm">2.</span>According to Shmuel, in either case he should be exempt!</p>
<p class="bas indent1"><span class="nm">(g)</span><span class="cl">Answer:</span> Shmuel exempts because he was humiliated by fleeing. Here, he did not flee.</p>
<p class="bas indent1"><span class="nm">(h)</span><span class="cl">Version #1 - our text - (Beraisa):</span> If they estimate that he will excrete (immediately) when lashed, he is exempt;</p>
<p class="bas indent2"><span class="nm">1.</span>If they estimate that he will excrete after he leaves Beis Din, he is lashed.</p>
<p class="bas indent2"><span class="nm">2.</span>Even if he excreted the first time (but before the overseer raised his hand), he is lashed - "v'Hikahu... v'Niklah"- not that he was disgraced before being lashed.</p>
<p class="bas indent1"><span class="nm">(i)</span><span class="cl">Version #2 - Rambam - (Beraisa):</span> If the excreted during the lashes, he is exempt;</p>
<p class="bas indent2"><span class="nm">1.</span>If he excreted before being lashed, he is not exempt;</p>
<p class="bas indent2"><span class="nm">2.</span>Even if he (was so afraid that he) excreted the night before, he is lashed - "v'Hikahu... v'Niklah" excludes one who was disgraced before being lashed.</p>
<p class="bas subject"><span class="nm">5)</span>DO LASHES EXEMPT FROM <i>KARES?</i></p>
<p class="bas indent1"><span class="nm">(a)</span><span class="cl">(Mishnah - R. Chanina ben Gamliel):</span> Anyone Chayav Kares who was lashed is exempted from Kares. "V'Niklah Achicha l'Einecha" - after he is lashed, he is like your brother;</p>
<p class="bas indent1"><span class="nm">(b)</span>If one who sins loses his life for it (Kares includes Misah bi'Ydei Shamayim), and all the more so one who does a Mitzvah receives life for it (because Hash-m's Midah to reward is greater than His Midah to punish; R. Ovadyah mi'Bartenura - some explain, his reward for accepting his punishment is to be exempted from Kares ).</p>
<p class="bas indent1"><span class="nm">(c)</span>R. Shimon says, we learn from "... v'Nichresu ha'Nefashos ha'Osos", and it says - "Asher Ya'aseh Osam ha'Adam va'Chai Bahem" (do not sin with Arayos):</p>
<p class="bas bbbline">23b----------------------------------------23b</p>
<p class="bas indent2"><span class="nm">1.</span>One who is passive and does not sin receives reward like one who did a Mitzvah.</p>
<p class="bas indent1"><span class="nm">(d)</span>R. Shimon bar Rebbi says, "Chazak l'Vilti Echol ha'Dam" - one finds blood revolting, yet he is rewarded for refraining from eating it. People desire theft and Arayos, so all the more so one who refrains from them merits for himself and all his descendants forever!</p>
<p class="bas indent1"><span class="nm">(e)</span>R. Chanina ben Akashya says, Hash-m wanted to bring merit to (some explain - refine) Yisrael, therefore he gave them many Mitzvos - "Hash-m Chafetz Lema'an Tzidko Yagdil Torah v'Yadir."</p>
<p class="bas indent1"><span class="nm">(f)</span><span class="cl">(Gemara - R. Yochanan):</span> Chachamim argue with R. Chanina ben Gamliel.</p>
<p class="bas indent1"><span class="nm">(g)</span><span class="cl">(Rav Ada bar Ahavah):</span> A Mishnah teaches this!</p>
<p class="bas indent2"><span class="nm">1.</span><span class="cl">(Mishnah):</span> The only difference between Shabbos and Yom Kipur is that intentional desecration of Shabbos is punishable by Beis Din, and the punishment for Yom Kipur is Kares.</p>
<p class="bas indent2"><span class="nm">2.</span>According to R. Chanina ben Gamliel, both are punishable by Beis Din!</p>
<p class="bas indent1"><span class="nm">(h)</span><span class="cl">Rejection #1 (Rav Nachman):</span> No, that Mishnah is like R. Yitzchak, who says that Chayavei Kerisus are not lashed.</p>
<p class="bas indent2"><span class="nm">1.</span><span class="cl">(Beraisa - R. Yitzchak):</span> The Torah taught that (all) Arayos are Chayavei Kerisus, and (superfluously) mentions Kares for Bi'ah with a sister;</p>
<p class="bas indent3"><span class="nm">i.</span>This teaches that it (and all other Chayavei Kerisus) are punishable by Kares, and not by lashes.</p>
<p class="bas indent2"><span class="nm">2.</span><span class="cl">Rejection #2 (Rav Ashi):</span> The Mishnah is even like Chachamim (who argue with R. Yitzchak). It means that the <i>primary</i> punishment for Shabbos (b'Mezid) is by Beis Din, and the primary punishment for Yom Kipur (b'Mezid) is Kares (even though lashes can exempt from Kares).</p>
<p class="bas indent1"><span class="nm">(i)</span><span class="cl">(Rav Ada bar Ahavah):</span> The Halachah follows R. Chanina ben Gamliel.</p>
<p class="bas indent1"><span class="nm">(j)</span><span class="cl">Rav Yosef:</span> Hash-m decides who gets Kares. Who heard from Him whom the Halachah follows?!</p>
<p class="bas indent1"><span class="nm">(k)</span><span class="cl">Abaye:</span> R. Yehoshua ben Levi taught that Beis Din made three enactments, and the Heavenly Beis Din agreed. (They are brought below.) Who told him what the Heavenly Beis Din said?!</p>
<p class="bas indent2"><span class="nm">1.</span>We must say that he learned this through expounding verses. Likewise, Rav Ada expounds a verse!</p>
<p class="bas subject"><span class="nm">6)</span>APPROVAL FROM ABOVE</p>
<p class="bas indent1"><span class="nm">(a)</span><span class="cl">(R. Yehoshua ben Levi):</span> Beis Din made three enactments, and the Heavenly Beis Din agreed: reading Megilas Esther on Purim, greeting people with Hash-m's name, and bringing Ma'aser (from (all) fruits and vegetables; alternatively, to the Mikdash, in order that Kohanim will share it with the Leviyim).</p>
<p class="bas indent2"><span class="nm">1.</span>Regarding reading the Megilah, "Kiymu v'Kiblu ha'Yehudim" teaches that the Beis Din above affirmed what Yisrael accepted below;</p>
<p class="bas indent2"><span class="nm">2.</span>We learn about greeting people with Hash-m's name from "Bo'az Ba...  Hash-m Imachem" and "Hash-m Imcha Gibor he'Chayil."</p>
<p class="bas indent3"><span class="nm">i.</span><span class="cl">Question:</span> Why do we need the second verse?</p>
<p class="bas indent3"><span class="nm">ii.</span><span class="cl">Answer:</span> One might have thought that Bo'az decided by himself and Beis Din above did not agree. "Hash-m Imcha" shows that Hash-m agreed.</p>
<p class="bas indent2"><span class="nm">3.</span>We learn about Ma'aser from "Havi'u Es Kol ha'Ma'aser... va'Harikosi Lachem Berachah Ad Bli Dai." (Hash-m's blessing shows that He agreed.)</p>
<p class="bas indent3"><span class="nm">i.</span><span class="cl">Question:</span> What does it mean "Ad Bli <i>Dai</i>"?</p>
<p class="bas indent3"><span class="nm">ii.</span><span class="cl">Answer (Rami bar Rav):</span> It is until your lips will wear out from saying 'enough'!</p>
<p class="bas indent1"><span class="nm">(b)</span><span class="cl">(R. Elazar):</span> Ru'ach ha'Kodesh appeared openly in three places - the Batei Din of Shem, Shmuel and Shlomo.</p>
<p class="bas indent2"><span class="nm">1.</span>We learn about Shem's Beis Din from "va'Yaker Yehudah va'Yomer Tzadkah Mimeni."</p>
<p class="bas indent3"><span class="nm">i.</span><span class="cl">Question:</span> How could he know that she was pregnant from him? (Perhaps she had Bi'ah with others, too!)</p>
<p class="bas indent3"><span class="nm">ii.</span><span class="cl">Answer:</span> (Yehudah said only "Tzadkah.") Ru'ach ha'Kodesh said '<i>Mimeni</i> Yatz'u Kevushim' (Hash-m directed hidden matters to cause seed from Yehudah and Tamar.)</p>
<p class="bas indent2"><span class="nm">2.</span>We learn about Shmuel's Beis Din from "Anu Vi Neged Hash-m... va'Yomer Ed."</p>
<p class="bas indent3"><span class="nm">i.</span><span class="cl">Question:</span> It should say 'va'Yomru' (the people answered him)!</p>
<p class="bas indent3"><span class="nm">ii.</span><span class="cl">Answer:</span> A Bas Kol announced 'I (Hash-m) testify to this.'</p>
<p class="bas indent2"><span class="nm">3.</span>We learn about Shlomo's Beis Din from "(do not kill the baby.) Hi Imo";</p>
<p class="bas indent3"><span class="nm">i.</span><span class="cl">Question:</span> How did he know that she was his mother? Perhaps she schemed to refuse to kill him in order to appear like the mother!</p>
<p class="bas indent3"><span class="nm">ii.</span><span class="cl">Answer:</span> A Bas Kol announced "Hi Imo."</p>
<p class="bas indent1"><span class="nm">(c)</span><span class="cl">Rejection (Rava):</span> These things could be known without Ru'ach ha'Kodesh!</p>
<p class="bas indent2"><span class="nm">1.</span>Perhaps Yehudah calculated the months and days from when he had Bi'ah with her (and it corresponded that the fetus showed now). He did not know that she had Bi'ah with anyone else, so we do not attribute er pregnancy to something unknown!</p>
<p class="bas indent2"><span class="nm">2.</span>Regarding Shmuel, we find that Yisrael are referred to in the singular - "Yisrael Nosha ba'Shem"!</p>
<p class="bas indent2"><span class="nm">3.</span>Perhaps Shlomo reasoned that since one had mercy on the baby, and the other did not, the former was the mother!</p>
<p class="bas indent2"><span class="nm">4.</span>Rather, tradition teaches that Ru'ach ha'Kodesh said these things.</p>
<p class="bas indent1"><span class="nm">(d)</span><span class="cl">(R. Simlai):</span> Moshe received 613 Mitzvos. They are 365 Lavim, corresponding to the days of the (solar) year, and 248 Mitzvos Aseh, corresponding to the limbs in a man.</p>
<p class="bas indent1"><span class="nm">(e)</span><span class="cl">(Rav Hamnuna):</span> He learns from "Torah Tzivah Lanu Moshe" - the Gematri'a of Torah is 611;</p>
<p class="bas indent2"><span class="nm">1.</span>Additionally, Yisrael heard two Mitzvos (the first two utterances) directly from Hash-m, "Anochi..." and "Lo Yihyeh Lecha."</p>
<p class="bas normal"></p>
