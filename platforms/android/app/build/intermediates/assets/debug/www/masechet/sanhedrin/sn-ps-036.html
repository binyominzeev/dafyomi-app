<p class="bas subject"><span class="nm">1)</span>DOES MISAS BEIS DIN OVERRIDE AVODAH? (cont.)</p>
<p class="bas indent1"><span class="nm">(a)</span><span class="cl">Answer #1 (Rava):</span> (You cannot say that "me'Im Mizbechi Tikachenu Lamus" refers only to a Korban Yachid, because) a Kal va'Chomer should teach that Misas Beis Din does not override Avodah, even for a Korban Yachid!</p>
<p class="bas indent2"><span class="nm">1.</span>A Korban Yachid (Shelamim) overrides Yom Tov, but Misas Beis Din does not override Yom Tov. All the more so, Misas Beis Din does not override a Korban Yachid!</p>
<p class="bas indent1"><span class="nm">(b)</span><span class="cl">Question:</span> (Rava assumed that a Korban Yachid overrides Yom Tov.) This is like the opinion that we may offer Nedarim (a vow to bring <i>an</i> animal) and Nedavos (one said 'this animal is a Korban) on Yom Tov;</p>
<p class="bas indent2"><span class="nm">1.</span>However, according to the opinion that we may not offer Nedarim and Nedavos on Yom Tov, how can he answer Abaye?</p>
<p class="bas indent1"><span class="nm">(c)</span><span class="cl">Answer #2 (Rava):</span> According to the opinion that we may offer Nedarim and Nedavos on Yom Tov, "me'Im Mizbechi" refutes Abaye's Kal va'Chomer (like above);</p>
<p class="bas indent2"><span class="nm">1.</span>Even according to the opinion that forbids Nedarim and Nedavos on Yom Tov, "me'Im <i>Mizbechi</i>" denotes the (Korban on the) Mizbe'ach special to Hash-m, i.e. the Tamid. This is a Korban Tzibur, and the Torah commands to kill the Kohen before he does the Avodah!</p>
<p class="bas subject"><span class="nm">2)</span>THE GREATEST CHACHAM</p>
<p class="bas indent1"><span class="nm">(a)</span><span class="cl">(Mishnah):</span> In monetary cases or questions of Tum'ah...</p>
<p class="bas indent1"><span class="nm">(b)</span><span class="cl">(Rav):</span> I was counted on Rebbi's Beis Din, and I used to begin.</p>
<p class="bas indent1"><span class="nm">(c)</span><span class="cl">Question:</span> The Mishnah says that we begin with the greatest (for everything except for capital cases, which they did not judge in Rebbi's time)!</p>
<p class="bas indent1"><span class="nm">(d)</span><span class="cl">Answer (Rabah brei d'Rava):</span> Rebbi's Beis Din was different. They always used to begin with an intermediate Chacham (due to Rebbi's humility).</p>
<p class="bas indent1"><span class="nm">(e)</span><span class="cl">(Rabah brei d'Rava):</span> From the time of Moshe until Rebbi, the greatest Chacham was never the executive leader of Yisrael.</p>
<p class="bas indent1"><span class="nm">(f)</span><span class="cl">Question:</span> Yehoshua was the greatest Chacham, and also the leader!</p>
<p class="bas indent1"><span class="nm">(g)</span><span class="cl">Answer:</span> There was a Chacham as great as him, Elazar ha'Kohen.</p>
<p class="bas indent1"><span class="nm">(h)</span><span class="cl">Questions:</span> Each of the following was the greatest Chacham of his time, and also the leader: Pinchas, Sha'ul, David, Shlomo, Chizkiyah, and Ezra!</p>
<p class="bas indent1"><span class="nm">(i)</span><span class="cl">Answer:</span> Each had another Chacham as great as him. Pinchas had the Zekenim (Shofetim), Sha'ul had Shmuel, David had Ira ha'Ye'iri, Shlomo had Shim'i ben Gera, Chizkiyah had Shevna, and Ezra had Nechemyah.</p>
<p class="bas indent1"><span class="nm">(j)</span><span class="cl">Questions:</span> After Shmuel died, Sha'ul was the greatest Chacham! Shlomo was the greatest after he killed Shim'i, and Chizkiyah was the greatest after Shevna died!</p>
<p class="bas indent1"><span class="nm">(k)</span><span class="cl">Answer:</span> Rabah meant that no one between Moshe and Rebbi was the greatest Chacham all the years that he was the leader.</p>
<p class="bas indent1"><span class="nm">(l)</span><span class="cl">(Rav Ada bar Ahavah):</span> Likewise, from the time of Rebbi until Rav Ashi, the greatest Chacham was never the leader.</p>
<p class="bas indent1"><span class="nm">(m)</span><span class="cl">Question:</span> There was Huna bar Noson (he was as powerful as Rav Ashi)!</p>
<p class="bas indent1"><span class="nm">(n)</span><span class="cl">Answer:</span> Huna was submissive to Rav Ashi.</p>
<p class="bas indent1"><span class="nm">(o)</span><span class="cl">(Mishnah):</span> In capital cases we begin with an intermediate Chacham.</p>
<p class="bas indent1"><span class="nm">(p)</span><span class="cl">Question:</span> What is the source of this?</p>
<p class="bas indent1"><span class="nm">(q)</span><span class="cl">Answer #1 (Rav Acha bar Papa):</span> "Lo Sa'aneh Al Riv" - we read this 'Al <i>Rav</i>', do not argue with the greatest Chacham. (If the greatest begins, perhaps he will give a reason for Chiyuv, and no one will argue with him. Others may <i>question</i> the Rav (Tosfos), but perhaps they will refrain.)</p>
<p class="bas indent1"><span class="nm">(r)</span><span class="cl">Answer #2 (Rabah bar bar Chanah):</span> "Va'Yachgeru Ish Es Charbo Gam David" (others began to judge Naval for rebellion against the king, and then David joined them).</p>
<p class="bas subject"><span class="nm">3)</span>COUNTING A REBBI AND HIS TALMID</p>
<p class="bas indent1"><span class="nm">(a)</span><span class="cl">(Rav):</span> In capital cases, one may explain the reasons for Zechus and Chiyuv to his Talmid, and the Talmid is also counted in the vote on the verdict.</p>
<p class="bas indent1"><span class="nm">(b)</span><span class="cl">Question (Beraisa):</span> In cases of Tum'ah, a father and his son, or a Rebbi and his Talmid, count like two;</p>
<p class="bas indent2"><span class="nm">1.</span>In monetary cases, capital cases, lashes, Kidush ha'Chodesh, and Ibur Shanah, a father and his son (or a Rebbi and his Talmid) count like only one.</p>
<p class="bas bbbline">36b----------------------------------------36b</p>
<p class="bas indent1"><span class="nm">(c)</span><span class="cl">Answer:</span> Rav referred to Talmidim such as Rav Kahana and Rav Asi, who needed to hear teachings from a Rebbi, but could reason by themselves, and did not need a Rebbi for this.</p>
<p class="bas subject"><span class="nm">4)</span>WHO MAY JUDGE CAPITAL CASES</p>
<p class="bas indent1"><span class="nm">(a)</span><span class="cl">(R. Avahu):</span> There are 10 differences between monetary and capital cases. The only one that applies to an animal that is stoned (for killing a Yisrael) is that 23 judges are required.</p>
<p class="bas indent1"><span class="nm">(b)</span><span class="cl">Question:</span> What is the source of this?</p>
<p class="bas indent1"><span class="nm">(c)</span><span class="cl">Answer (Rav Acha bar Papa):</span> "Lo Sateh Mishpat Evyoncha b'Rivo" - you do not tilt (to Mechayev through a majority of one) the judgment of the poor, but you may tilt the judgment of an ox.</p>
<p class="bas indent1"><span class="nm">(d)</span><span class="cl">Question:</span> Our Mishnah teaches nine differences, and not 10!</p>
<p class="bas indent2"><span class="nm">1.</span><span class="cl">Question:</span> It teaches 10!</p>
<p class="bas indent2"><span class="nm">2.</span><span class="cl">Answer:</span> Two of these 10 are counted like one (23 judges are required, and not everyone is qualified to judge capital cases. Both of these are because a Sanhedrin is required.)</p>
<p class="bas indent1"><span class="nm">(e)</span><span class="cl">Answer:</span> A Beraisa teaches the 10th.</p>
<p class="bas indent2"><span class="nm">1.</span><span class="cl">(Beraisa):</span> We do not put on the Sanhedrin one who is old (and has forgotten the pain of raising children), a Seris, or one who has no children.</p>
<p class="bas indent2"><span class="nm">2.</span>R. Yehudah says, also a cruel person is disqualified.</p>
<p class="bas indent2"><span class="nm">3.</span>The opposite applies to a Mesis (we prefer such judges) - "Lo Sachmol v'Lo Sechaseh Alav."</p>
<p class="bas indent1"><span class="nm">(f)</span><span class="cl">(Mishnah):</span> Everyone is qualified to judge monetary cases.</p>
<p class="bas indent1"><span class="nm">(g)</span><span class="cl">Question:</span> What does this come to include?</p>
<p class="bas indent1"><span class="nm">(h)</span><span class="cl">Answer (Rav Yehudah):</span> It includes a Mamzer.</p>
<p class="bas indent1"><span class="nm">(i)</span><span class="cl">Question:</span> Rav Yehudah already taught this (from a different Mishnah)</p>
<p class="bas indent2"><span class="nm">1.</span><span class="cl">(Mishnah):</span> Anyone proper to judge capital cases is proper to judge monetary cases;</p>
<p class="bas indent2"><span class="nm">2.</span>There is someone qualified for monetary cases who is disqualified for capital cases.</p>
<p class="bas indent2"><span class="nm">3.</span><span class="cl">Question:</span> What does this come to include?</p>
<p class="bas indent2"><span class="nm">4.</span><span class="cl">Answer (Rav Yehudah):</span> It includes a Mamzer.</p>
<p class="bas indent1"><span class="nm">(j)</span><span class="cl">Answer:</span> One Mishnah includes a convert, and one includes a Mamzer. It needed to teach both.</p>
<p class="bas indent2"><span class="nm">1.</span>Had we taught only about a convert, one might have thought that he is Kosher for monetary cases, for he can marry a Bas Yisrael, but a Mamzer is disqualified;</p>
<p class="bas indent2"><span class="nm">2.</span>Had we taught only about a Mamzer, one might have thought that he can judge monetary cases, for he was conceived by Yisraelim, but a convert would be disqualified.</p>
<p class="bas indent1"><span class="nm">(k)</span><span class="cl">(Mishnah):</span> Not everyone is qualified to judge capital cases (only Yisraelim who may marry a Bas Kohen).</p>
<p class="bas indent1"><span class="nm">(l)</span><span class="cl">Question:</span> What is the reason?</p>
<p class="bas indent1"><span class="nm">(m)</span><span class="cl">Answer (Rav Yosef):</span> Just like Beis Din are clean from transgressions, they must be clean from all blemishes (of lineage).</p>
<p class="bas indent1"><span class="nm">(n)</span><span class="cl">(Ameimar):</span> We learn from "Kulach Yafah Rayasi u'Mum Ein Bach."</p>
<p class="bas indent1"><span class="nm">(o)</span><span class="cl">Question:</span> Perhaps it refers to physical blemishes!</p>
<p class="bas indent1"><span class="nm">(p)</span><span class="cl">Answer #1 (Rav Acha bar Yakov):</span> "V'Hisyatzvu Sham <i>Imach</i>" - they must resemble you (Moshe), i.e. have proper lineage.</p>
<p class="bas indent1"><span class="nm">(q)</span><span class="cl">Objection:</span> Perhaps Moshe's Sanhedrin needed proper lineage in order that the Shechinah should rest on it (but later Sanhedriyos do not)!</p>
<p class="bas indent1"><span class="nm">(r)</span><span class="cl">Answer #2 (Rav Nachman bar Yitzchak):</span> "V'Nas'u <i>Itach</i>" - they must resemble you. (This verse discusses judges appointed like Yisro suggested, to judge the people, and not for the Shechinah to rest on them).</p>
<p class="bas subject"><span class="nm">5)</span>HOW A SANHEDRIN SITS</p>
<p class="bas indent1"><span class="nm">(a)</span><span class="cl">(Mishnah):</span> (Even a small) Sanhedrin sat in a semi-circle, in order that they see each other.</p>
<p class="bas indent1"><span class="nm">(b)</span>One scribe stands to the right of the judges and writes the words of the Mezakim, and one scribe stands to the left and writes the words of the Mechayvim.</p>
<p class="bas indent1"><span class="nm">(c)</span>R. Yehudah says, there are three scribes. One writes the words of the Mezakim, one writes the words of the Mechayvim, and one writes both.</p>
