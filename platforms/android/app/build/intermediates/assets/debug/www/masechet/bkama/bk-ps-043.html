<p class="bas subject"><span class="nm">1)</span>WHO INHERITS PAYMENTS DUE TO A WOMAN? (cont.)</p>
<p class="bas indent1"><span class="nm">(a)</span><span class="cl">Answer (Rabah and Rav Nachman):</span> That Beraisa discusses a divorcee.</p>
<p class="bas indent1"><span class="nm">(b)</span><span class="cl">Question:</span> If she is a divorcee, she should share the payment for the fetus!</p>
<p class="bas indent1"><span class="nm">(c)</span><span class="cl">Answer (Rav Papa):</span> The Torah said that the father gets it, even if she was never married to him.</p>
<p class="bas indent1"><span class="nm">(d)</span><span class="cl">Question:</span> What is the reason?</p>
<p class="bas indent1"><span class="nm">(e)</span><span class="cl">Answer:</span> It says "like Ba'al ha'Ishah will place upon him " (we expound this as if it said Bo'el, the one who had Bi'ah with her.)</p>
<p class="bas indent1"><span class="nm">(f)</span><span class="cl">Question:</span> Why did Rabah and Rav Nachman establish the Beraisa to discuss a divorcee? Each of them could have explained it even if she was not divorced!</p>
<p class="bas indent2"><span class="nm">1.</span><span class="cl">(Rabah):</span> A firstborn gets an extra share in land given to pay a loan that was owed to his father, but not if it was paid in money. (It is as if the land was Muchzak to be his father's, for he had a lien on it. The money was only Ra'uy. Likewise, a husband would not receive money paid for Kofer for his wife, for it is only Ra'uy.)</p>
<p class="bas indent2"><span class="nm">2.</span><span class="cl">(Rav Nachman):</span> A firstborn gets an extra share in money given to pay a loan that was owed to his father, but not if it was paid in land. (When he gets back money, like he lent, it is as if it was Muchzak to be his father's. Land was only Ra'uy to come. Likewise, a husband would not receive land paid for Kofer for his wife, for it is only Ra'uy.)</p>
<p class="bas indent1"><span class="nm">(g)</span><span class="cl">Answer:</span> These teachings are like Chachamim of Eretz Yisrael, according to Chachamim. Above (a) they explain like Rebbi (who says that a firstborn gets an extra share of a loan, whether it was paid in land or money).</p>
<p class="bas subject"><span class="nm">2)</span>PAYING THE VALUE OF THE VICTIM</p>
<p class="bas indent1"><span class="nm">(a)</span><span class="cl">(Reish Lakish):</span> One does not pay if his ox killed a slave unintentionally - "he will give 30 Shekalim, and the ox will be stoned." The owner pays only when the ox is stoned.</p>
<p class="bas indent1"><span class="nm">(b)</span><span class="cl">(Rabah):</span> One does not pay if his ox killed a free man unintentionally - "the ox will be stoned, and also the owner will die. If Kofer will be put upon him... " - the owner pays only when the ox is stoned.</p>
<p class="bas indent1"><span class="nm">(c)</span><span class="cl">Question (Abaye - Mishnah):</span> If a man said 'my ox killed Ploni or Ploni's ox', he pays due to his own admission.</p>
<p class="bas indent2"><span class="nm">1.</span><span class="cl">Suggestion:</span> He pays Kofer (even though his ox is not stoned due to his admission)!</p>
<p class="bas indent1"><span class="nm">(d)</span><span class="cl">Answer:</span> No, he pays (like) money (normal damages), not Kofer.</p>
<p class="bas indent1"><span class="nm">(e)</span><span class="cl">Question (Reisha):</span> If he said 'my ox killed Ploni's slave', he does not pay due to his own admission!</p>
<p class="bas indent2"><span class="nm">1.</span>Why shouldn't he pay as money?</p>
<p class="bas indent2"><span class="nm">2.</span><span class="cl">Rabah:</span> I could tell you that the Reisha discusses paying money, and the Seifa discusses the fine, but that it is a poor answer.</p>
<p class="bas indent1"><span class="nm">(f)</span><span class="cl">Answer (Rabah):</span> Both discuss money;</p>
<p class="bas bbbline">43b----------------------------------------43b</p>
<p class="bas indent2"><span class="nm">1.</span>Regarding a free man, he (sometimes) pays Kofer through his own admission (this will be explained) so when there are no witnesses, he pays money;</p>
<p class="bas indent2"><span class="nm">2.</span>Regarding a slave, he (never) pays a fine through his own admission (like we will explain), so when there are no witnesses, he does not pay money.</p>
<p class="bas indent3"><span class="nm">i.</span>One pays Kofer through his own admission, for example, if witnesses testify to the goring, but they did not know if the ox was Mu'ad, and the owner says that it was Mu'ad.</p>
<p class="bas indent3"><span class="nm">ii.</span>One does not pay the fine for a slave through his own admission, (even) if witnesses testify to the goring, but they did not know if the ox was Mu'ad, and the owner says that it was Mu'ad.</p>
<p class="bas indent1"><span class="nm">(g)</span><span class="cl">Question (Rav Shmuel bar Rav Yitzchak - Beraisa):</span> Anything liable for (killing) a free man is liable for a slave. This applies to Kofer, and killing the ox.</p>
<p class="bas indent2"><span class="nm">1.</span><span class="cl">Question:</span> Kofer does not apply to slaves!</p>
<p class="bas indent2"><span class="nm">2.</span><span class="cl">Answer:</span> Rather, it refers to money (their value).</p>
<p class="bas indent1"><span class="nm">(h)</span><span class="cl">Answer (Rav Shmuel bar Rav Yitzchak or Rabah):</span> The Beraisa means that any case that pays Kofer for a free man, i.e. with intent according to witnesses, pays the fine for a slave;</p>
<p class="bas indent2"><span class="nm">1.</span>Cases that pay money for a free man, e.g. without intent according to witnesses, pay money for a slave.</p>
<p class="bas indent1"><span class="nm">(i)</span><span class="cl">Question (Rava):</span> If so, one should pay money when one killed through fire b'Shogeg according to witnesses!</p>
<p class="bas indent2"><span class="nm">1.</span><span class="cl">Question:</span> How does Rava know that one does not?</p>
<p class="bas indent3"><span class="nm">i.</span><span class="cl">Suggestion (Mishnah):</span> If Reuven lit a stack of grain and there was a goat tied to it and a slave nearby, and they were burned, Reuven is liable. If there was a slave tied to it and a goat nearby, and they were burned, Reuven is exempt (even if he is not Chayav Misah for killing the slave).</p>
<p class="bas indent3"><span class="nm">ii.</span><span class="cl">Rejection:</span> Reish Lakish said, the case is that he directly burned the slave. He is exempt because he is liable to death!</p>
<p class="bas indent2"><span class="nm">2.</span><span class="cl">Answer #1 (Beraisa):</span> Stringencies of a fire over a pit... fire is liable even for things unfitting for it to consume.</p>
<p class="bas indent3"><span class="nm">i.</span>It does not say that a fire pays money without intent, but a pit does not.'</p>
<p class="bas indent2"><span class="nm">3.</span><span class="cl">Rejection:</span> Perhaps the Tana omitted some stringencies.</p>
<p class="bas indent2"><span class="nm">4.</span><span class="cl">Answer #2:</span> Rava himself did not know whether one pays money for fire without intent according to witnesses;</p>
<p class="bas indent3"><span class="nm">i.</span>Do we say that an ox pays Kofer with intent, so it pays money without intent, but fire does not pay Kofer with intent, so it does not pay money without intent?</p>
<p class="bas indent3"><span class="nm">ii.</span>Or, do we say that just like an ox pays money without intent, also fire, even though an ox pays Kofer with intent and fire does not?</p>
<p class="bas indent1"><span class="nm">(j)</span>This question is unresolved.</p>
<p class="bas subject"><span class="nm">3)</span>FINE AND <i>KOFER</i> FOR KILLING WITHOUT INTENT</p>
<p class="bas indent1"><span class="nm">(a)</span><span class="cl">(Rav Dimi, citing R. Yochanan):</span> "If Kofer will be set on him" includes Kofer without intent like with intent.</p>
<p class="bas indent1"><span class="nm">(b)</span><span class="cl">Question (Abaye):</span> If so, you should also learn from "if a slave" that one pays the fine for a slave without intent as with intent!</p>
<p class="bas indent2"><span class="nm">1.</span><span class="cl">Suggestion:</span> Perhaps that is the law!</p>
<p class="bas indent2"><span class="nm">2.</span><span class="cl">Rejection:</span> Reish Lakish taught that an ox that unintentionally killed a slave is exempt from 30 Shekalim.</p>
<p class="bas indent1"><span class="nm">(c)</span><span class="cl">Answer:</span> (That is the law.) Rav Dimi argues with Reish Lakish.</p>
<p class="bas indent1"><span class="nm">(d)</span><span class="cl">(Ravin, citing R. Yochanan):</span> "If a slave" teaches that one pays the fine for a slave without intent as with intent.</p>
<p class="bas indent1"><span class="nm">(e)</span><span class="cl">Suggestion:</span> Since Reish Lakish does not expound "if a slave" like R. Yochanan, he also argues about Kofer!</p>
<p class="bas indent1"><span class="nm">(f)</span><span class="cl">Rejection:</span> No, he agrees about "if Kofer".</p>
<p class="bas indent1"><span class="nm">(g)</span><span class="cl">Question:</span> What is the difference?</p>
<p class="bas indent1"><span class="nm">(h)</span><span class="cl">Answer:</span> "If Kofer" is written regarding the payment. "If a slave" is not.</p>
