<p class="bas subject"><span class="nm">1)</span>THE ANGELS' VISIT (cont.)</p>
<p class="bas indent1"><span class="nm">(a)</span><span class="cl">Question:</span> Why did they immediately accept Avraham's offer to host them, but Lot had to insist?</p>
<p class="bas indent1"><span class="nm">(b)</span><span class="cl">(R. Elazar):</span> This teaches that we may refuse the offer of a small person, but not of a great person.</p>
<p class="bas indent1"><span class="nm">(c)</span><span class="cl">Question:</span> Avraham offered only bread, but he gave beef!</p>
<p class="bas indent1"><span class="nm">(d)</span><span class="cl">(R. Elazar):</span> This teaches that Tzadikim say little and do much.</p>
<p class="bas indent2"><span class="nm">1.</span>The wicked say much and do not even do little!</p>
<p class="bas indent2"><span class="nm">2.</span>We learn from Efron. At first, he said "(land worth four hundred silver Shekalim (is a small matter; take it for a free gift)." In the end, "Avraham heard (the true desire of) Efron... 400 Shekel Kesef Over la'Socher (accepted by any merchant)";</p>
<p class="bas indent3"><span class="nm">i.</span>Efron demanded 400 coins each worth 10,000 Dinarim. There are places where 10,000 Dinarim is called 'Shekel'.</p>
<p class="bas indent1"><span class="nm">(e)</span><span class="cl">Question:</span> Avraham asked Sarah to take "Kemach Soles." Did he mean Kemach (regular flour) or Soles (fine flour)?</p>
<p class="bas indent1"><span class="nm">(f)</span><span class="cl">Answer (R. Yitzchak):</span> This teaches that woman are stingier with guests than men are. (She wanted to give Kemach; he insisted on Soles.)</p>
<p class="bas indent1"><span class="nm">(g)</span><span class="cl">Question:</span> Avraham asked her to make "Ugos" (cakes of bread), but we do not find that he served them!</p>
<p class="bas indent1"><span class="nm">(h)</span><span class="cl">Answer (Efrayim Maksha'ah):</span> Sarah became Nidah that day, and Avraham used to eat even Chulin in Taharah. (The bread became Tamei. Maharsha - she was not yet Nidah when she laughed! Rather, Avraham ate Chulin with the stringencies of Kodshim. For Kodshim, a Nidah is retroactively Teme'ah 24 hours before she sees blood. The angels told Avraham that Sarah would become Teme'ah that day.)</p>
<p class="bas indent1"><span class="nm">(i)</span>Avraham told them that Sarah is in the tent. This teaches that she was modest.</p>
<p class="bas indent1"><span class="nm">(j)</span><span class="cl">(Rav Yehudah):</span> Even though the angels knew this, they asked where Sarah was, to endear her to Avraham.</p>
<p class="bas indent1"><span class="nm">(k)</span><span class="cl">(R. Yosi bar Chanina):</span> They asked in order to send her to drink from the cup over which they said Birkas ha'Mazon.</p>
<p class="bas indent1"><span class="nm">(l)</span><span class="cl">(R. Yosi):</span> There are dots over the letters 'Aleph, Yud, Vav' of "Elav". This teaches that (they knew 'Ayo (where)' she was. They only asked because) it is proper conduct to inquire about the host's wife.</p>
<p class="bas indent1"><span class="nm">(m)</span><span class="cl">Question:</span> Shmuel taught that we do not inquire about women at all!</p>
<p class="bas indent1"><span class="nm">(n)</span><span class="cl">Answer:</span> One may ask through her husband.</p>
<p class="bas indent1"><span class="nm">(o)</span><span class="cl">(Rav Chisda):</span> "Acharei Velosi Haysah Li Ednah" - after becoming wrinkled, her skin became smooth, and she returned to her beauty.</p>
<p class="bas indent1"><span class="nm">(p)</span><span class="cl">Question:</span> She said "va'Doni Zaken", but Hash-m told Avraham that she said "va'Ani Zakanti"!</p>
<p class="bas indent1"><span class="nm">(q)</span><span class="cl">Answer (Tana d'Vei R. Yishmael):</span> Shalom is so important that Hash-m switched her words (so Avraham would not know that she called him 'old').</p>
<p class="bas subject"><span class="nm">2)</span>PUBLICIZING THE MIRACLE</p>
<p class="bas indent1"><span class="nm">(a)</span><span class="cl">Question:</span> Why does it say "Heinikah Banim" (she nursed sons)? Sarah only had one son!</p>
<p class="bas indent1"><span class="nm">(b)</span><span class="cl">Answer (R. Levi):</span> Avraham made a big banquet on the day he weaned Yitzchak (to publicize the miracle). Everyone was saying that Sarah did not bear Yitzchak, rather, they found and raised a deserted baby. To prove this, everyone brought a baby without anyone to nurse him, and asked Sarah to nurse him (one who did not give birth cannot nurse). Hash-m made a miracle that Sarah had enough milk to satisfy all the babies.</p>
<p class="bas indent2"><span class="nm">1.</span>They were forced to admit that Sarah bore Yitzchak. They said, this is because she is only 90. Avraham is 100, so surely it is not his son! (Rather, she became pregnant from Avimelech, who took her for a night!)</p>
<p class="bas indent2"><span class="nm">2.</span>Hash-m immediately made Yitzchak's face resemble Avraham's, forcing them to admit that "Avraham fathered Yitzchak."</p>
<p class="bas indent1"><span class="nm">(c)</span>Until Avraham, there were no visible signs of old age. People who wanted to talk with Avraham sometimes talked to Yitzchak (and vice-versa, because they looked the same). Avraham prayed for a solution, and Hash-m agreed - "v'Avraham Zaken Ba ba'Yamim."</p>
<p class="bas indent1"><span class="nm">(d)</span>Until Yakov, there was no weakness (shortly before death. People did not know when to command or bless their children. Yitzchak blessed his sons 57 years before his death, for "I do not know when I will die" (Bereishis 27:2).) Yakov prayed for a solution, and Hash-m agreed - "va'Yomer l'Yosef Hinei Avicha Choleh."</p>
<p class="bas indent1"><span class="nm">(e)</span>Until Elisha, no one ever recovered from weakness (it came only shortly before death). He prayed, and recovered. "Chalyo Asher Yamus Bo" implies that he was sick other times (and recovered).</p>
<p class="bas subject"><span class="nm">3)</span>THE LOCAL CUSTOM</p>
<p class="bas indent1"><span class="nm">(a)</span><span class="cl">(Mishnah):</span> Before they start working, tell them that you promise them only bread and legumes.</p>
<p class="bas indent1"><span class="nm">(b)</span><span class="cl">Question (Rav Acha brei d'Rav Yosef):</span> Is the text of the Mishnah 'bread of legumes' or 'bread and legumes'?</p>
<p class="bas indent1"><span class="nm">(c)</span><span class="cl">Answer (Rav Chisda):</span> I swear, it is 'bread and legumes.'</p>
<p class="bas indent1"><span class="nm">(d)</span><span class="cl">(Mishnah - R. Shimon ben Gamliel):</span> There was no need for this. All is like the local custom.</p>
<p class="bas indent1"><span class="nm">(e)</span><span class="cl">Question:</span> What does 'all' come to include?</p>
<p class="bas indent1"><span class="nm">(f)</span><span class="cl">Answer:</span> It includes the following case (R. Shimon holds like Chachamim. The custom overrides the rule that 'to take money from another, one must bring proof.')</p>
<p class="bas indent2"><span class="nm">1.</span><span class="cl">(Mishnah - R. Yehoshua):</span> If one hires a worker 'like one or two of the people of the city', he gets the lowest wage people get;</p>
<p class="bas indent2"><span class="nm">2.</span>Chachamim say, he gets the average of the highest and lowest wages (Rambam; Rashi -  he gets an intermediate wage).</p>
<p class="bas subject"><span class="nm">4)</span>WHEN WORKERS MAY EAT THE OWNER'S FOOD</p>
<p class="bas indent1"><span class="nm">(a)</span><span class="cl">(Mishnah):</span> If one is working with finished food attached to the ground (Tosfos - it is ready to be harvested; Rashi - he is harvesting), or any labor with detached food that (needs further processing and therefore) is exempt from Ma'aser, he may eat;</p>
<p class="bas indent1"><span class="nm">(b)</span>If one is working with unfinished attached food, or with detached (finished) food that must be tithed (before eating), or with food that did not grow from the ground, he may not eat.</p>
<p class="bas bbbline">87b----------------------------------------87b</p>
<p class="bas indent1"><span class="nm">(c)</span><span class="cl">(Gemara) Question:</span> What is the source of this?</p>
<p class="bas indent1"><span class="nm">(d)</span><span class="cl">Answer:</span> "B'Cherem Re'echa you may eat."</p>
<p class="bas indent1"><span class="nm">(e)</span><span class="cl">Question:</span> What is the source to permit eating in places other than a vineyard?</p>
<p class="bas indent1"><span class="nm">(f)</span><span class="cl">Answer #1:</span> We learn from a vineyard. A worker may eat grapes in a vineyard; they grow from the ground and are finished. Also anyone working with finished food that grows from the ground may eat.</p>
<p class="bas indent1"><span class="nm">(g)</span><span class="cl">Objection:</span> We cannot learn from a vineyard. There, workers may eat, for the owner must also leave Olelos (deficient clusters) for the poor. (For other Peros, there is no law analogous to Olelos. Perhaps workers may not eat!)</p>
<p class="bas indent1"><span class="nm">(h)</span><span class="cl">Answer #2:</span> We learn from Kamah (standing crop, i.e. grain).</p>
<p class="bas indent2"><span class="nm">1.</span><span class="cl">Question:</span> What is the source that he may eat Kamah?</p>
<p class="bas indent2"><span class="nm">2.</span><span class="cl">Answer:</span> "B'Kamas Re'echa".</p>
<p class="bas indent1"><span class="nm">(i)</span><span class="cl">Objection:</span> We cannot learn from Kamah, for Chalah must be separated (when making a dough) from it.</p>
<p class="bas indent2"><span class="nm">1.</span><span class="cl">Question:</span> What is the source that the verse discusses Kamah (of the five grains,) from which Chalah must be taken? Perhaps it discusses any standing crop!</p>
<p class="bas indent2"><span class="nm">2.</span><span class="cl">Answer:</span> We learn a Gezeirah Shavah "Kamah-Kamah" from the Omer offered on the second day of Pesach. Just like that discusses (barley,) something from which Chalah is taken, also here.</p>
<p class="bas indent1"><span class="nm">(j)</span><span class="cl">Answer #3:</span> We learn from a vineyard that permission to eat does not depend on liability to take Chalah.</p>
<p class="bas indent2"><span class="nm">1.</span><span class="cl">Question:</span> We cannot learn from a vineyard, for one must leave Olelos there!</p>
<p class="bas indent2"><span class="nm">2.</span><span class="cl">Answer:</span> We learn from Kamah that permission to eat does not depend on Olelos.</p>
<p class="bas indent3"><span class="nm">i.</span>The stringency of each is unlike the stringency of the other. What is common to both is that they grow from the ground, and when they are finished, anyone working with them may eat them. Likewise, anything that grows from the ground, when it is finished, anyone working with it may eat it.</p>
<p class="bas indent1"><span class="nm">(k)</span><span class="cl">Objection:</span> We cannot learn from the Tzad ha'Shavah, since (products of) both grapes and Kamah are offered on the Mizbe'ach!</p>
<p class="bas indent2"><span class="nm">1.</span><span class="cl">Concession:</span> At least we can learn to olives, for its oil is offered on the Mizbe'ach.</p>
<p class="bas indent2"><span class="nm">2.</span><span class="cl">Question:</span> We need not learn olives from the Tzad ha'Shavah. An olive orchard itself is called a vineyard - "Kerem Zayis"!</p>
<p class="bas indent2"><span class="nm">3.</span><span class="cl">Answer (Rav Papa):</span> It is called "Kerem Zayis", it is not called just 'Kerem'.</p>
<p class="bas indent2"><span class="nm">4.</span>We still have no source for foods not offered on the Mizbe'ach.</p>
<p class="bas indent1"><span class="nm">(l)</span><span class="cl">Answer #3 (Shmuel):</span> "<i>V</i>'Chermesh (<i>and</i> a scythe)" includes anything harvested with a scythe.</p>
<p class="bas indent2"><span class="nm">1.</span><span class="cl">Question:</span> That is needed to teach that one may eat only when he harvests them (Rashi; Tosfos - they are ready for harvesting) with a scythe!</p>
<p class="bas indent2"><span class="nm">2.</span><span class="cl">Answer:</span> We learn that from "v'El Kelyecha Lo Siten."</p>
<p class="bas indent1"><span class="nm">(m)</span><span class="cl">Objection:</span> This teaches only things harvested with a scythe. What is the source for things not harvested with a scythe?</p>
<p class="bas indent1"><span class="nm">(n)</span><span class="cl">Answer #4 (R. Yitzchak):</span> "Kamah" includes anything that stands (i.e. grows from the ground).</p>
<p class="bas indent1"><span class="nm">(o)</span><span class="cl">Question:</span>  We proved that "Kamah" only refers to things from which Chalah must be taken!</p>
<p class="bas indent1"><span class="nm">(p)</span><span class="cl">Answer:</span> That was before we expounded "V'Chermesh";</p>
<p class="bas indent2"><span class="nm">1.</span>Now that "v'Chermesh" teaches anything harvested with a scythe, whether or not Chalah is taken from it, "Kamah" is extra to teach everything that grows from the ground.</p>
<p class="bas indent1"><span class="nm">(q)</span><span class="cl">Question:</span> Now that we learned everything from "Kamah" and "v'Chermesh", why did the Torah have to write "Kerem"?</p>
<p class="bas indent1"><span class="nm">(r)</span><span class="cl">Answer (Rava):</span> It teaches about the special laws of a vineyard;</p>
<p class="bas indent2"><span class="nm">1.</span><span class="cl">(Beraisa):</span> It says "Ki Savo" regarding eating in another's vineyard, and also regarding paying a worker the same day. Just like the latter discusses a worker, also the former.</p>
<p class="bas indent2"><span class="nm">2.</span>The Torah discusses "b'Cherem Re'echa", but not in a Nochri's vineyard. (Rashi - there, you may even put into your Kelim; Ritva - there, you may not take at all.)</p>
<p class="bas indent2"><span class="nm">3.</span>We understand this according to the opinion that forbids stealing from Nochrim.</p>
<p class="bas indent2"><span class="nm">4.</span><span class="cl">Question:</span> According to the opinion that permits stealing from them, (Rashi - the verse is not needed; Ritva surely it does not forbid a worker), what do we learn from the verse?</p>
<p class="bas indent2"><span class="nm">5.</span><span class="cl">Answer:</span> You may eat "b'Cherem Re'echa", but not in a Hekdesh vineyard.</p>
<p class="bas indent2"><span class="nm">6.</span>"V'Achalta" - you may eat, but you may not suck the juice and discard the skin;</p>
<p class="bas indent2"><span class="nm">7.</span>You may eat "Anavim", but not grapes and something else (to make them tastier);</p>
<p class="bas indent2"><span class="nm">8.</span>You may eat "k'Nafshecha" - the worker's law is like the owner's;</p>
<p class="bas indent3"><span class="nm">i.</span>Just like the owner may eat without tithing (he need not tithe until making wine), also a worker.</p>
<p class="bas indent2"><span class="nm">9.</span>You may eat "Savecha (to satiation)" one may not gorge himself.</p>
<p class="bas indent2"><span class="nm">10.</span>"V'El Kelyecha Lo Siten" - you may eat only when you are putting in the owner's Kli (i.e. harvesting - Rashi; Tosfos - when they are ready to put in his Kli, i.e. fully ripe).</p>
