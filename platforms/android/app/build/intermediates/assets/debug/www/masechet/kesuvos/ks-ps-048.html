<p class="dedicationbox">KESUVOS 48 - Two weeks of study material have been dedicated by Mrs. Estanne Abraham Fawer to honor the Yahrzeit of her father, Rav Mordechai ben Eliezer Zvi (Rabbi Morton Weiner) Z'L, who passed away on 18 Teves 5760. May the merit of supporting and advancing Dafyomi study -- which was so important to him -- during the weeks of his Yahrzeit serve as an Iluy for his Neshamah. </p>

<p class="bas subject"><span class="nm">1)</span>THE OBLIGATION TO FEED ONE'S WIFE (cont.)</p>
<p class="bas indent1"><span class="nm">(a)</span>R. Elazar ben Yakov says, "She'erah Kesusah" - give to her clothing according to her age;</p>
<p class="bas indent2"><span class="nm">1.</span>Do not give to a girl clothing fitting for an older woman, nor clothing fitting for a girl to an older woman;</p>
<p class="bas indent1"><span class="nm">(b)</span>"Kesusah v'Onasah" - give clothing fitting for the season;</p>
<p class="bas indent2"><span class="nm">1.</span>Do not give new clothing in summer, nor worn clothing in winter.</p>
<p class="bas indent1"><span class="nm">(c)</span><span class="cl">(Rav Yosef - Beraisa):</span> "She'erah" - he should have Bi'ah without clothing, unlike the Persians who have Bi'ah clothed.</p>
<p class="bas indent1"><span class="nm">(d)</span>This supports Rav Huna, who said that if a man agrees to have Bi'ah only clothed, he must divorce his wife and pay a Kesuvah (if she desires).</p>
<p class="bas indent1"><span class="nm">(e)</span><span class="cl">(Mishnah - R. Yehudah):</span> Even the poorest Yisrael must have two flutists and a woman to arouse wailing at his wife's funeral.</p>
<p class="bas indent1"><span class="nm">(f)</span><span class="cl">Inference:</span> The first Tana does not require this.</p>
<p class="bas indent1"><span class="nm">(g)</span><span class="cl">Question:</span> What is the case?</p>
<p class="bas indent2"><span class="nm">1.</span>If it is her family's custom to have this, the first Tana should agree!</p>
<p class="bas indent2"><span class="nm">2.</span>If it is not her family's custom to have this, why does R. Yehudah require it?</p>
<p class="bas indent1"><span class="nm">(h)</span><span class="cl">Answer:</span> It is his family's custom, but not her family's;</p>
<p class="bas indent2"><span class="nm">1.</span>All agree that she rises with him (when his family's customs are greater) but does not descend (when his customs are lower). The first Tana holds that this applies only in her lifetime, but not after her death;</p>
<p class="bas indent2"><span class="nm">2.</span>R. Yehudah holds that she rises with him even after her death.</p>
<p class="bas indent1"><span class="nm">(i)</span><span class="cl">(Rav Chisda):</span> The Halachah follows R. Yehudah.</p>
<p class="bas subject"><span class="nm">2)</span>FOR WHAT DO SPEND MONEY OF ONE WHO WENT AWAY?</p>
<p class="bas indent1"><span class="nm">(a)</span><span class="cl">(Rav Chisda):</span> If a man went insane, Beis Din takes from his property to feed his wife and children, and for something else (this will be explained).</p>
<p class="bas indent1"><span class="nm">(b)</span><span class="cl">Question (Ravina):</span> Why is this different than the following?</p>
<p class="bas indent2"><span class="nm">1.</span><span class="cl">(Beraisa):</span> If a man went overseas and his wife demands food, Beis Din takes from his property to feed her, but not to feed his children or for something else.</p>
<p class="bas indent1"><span class="nm">(c)</span><span class="cl">Answer (Rav Ashi):</span> We distinguish between one who left intentionally and one who left unintentionally.</p>
<p class="bas indent1"><span class="nm">(d)</span><span class="cl">Question:</span> What is 'something else'?</p>
<p class="bas indent1"><span class="nm">(e)</span><span class="cl">Answer #1 (Rav Chisda):</span> It is cosmetics (for his wife).</p>
<p class="bas indent1"><span class="nm">(f)</span><span class="cl">Answer #2 (Rav Yosef):</span> It is Tzedakah.</p>
<p class="bas indent1"><span class="nm">(g)</span>Rav Chisda, who says that we do not give to her cosmetics, certainly agrees that we do not give Tzedakah from his property;</p>
<p class="bas indent2"><span class="nm">1.</span>Rav Yosef, who says that we do not give Tzedakah from his property, would say that we give to her cosmetics. Her husband does not want her to become repulsive.</p>
<p class="bas indent1"><span class="nm">(h)</span><span class="cl">(R. Chiya bar Avin):</span> If a man went overseas and his wife died, Beis Din takes from his estate to bury her, according to his honor.</p>
<p class="bas indent1"><span class="nm">(i)</span><span class="cl">Question:</span> Do we bury her according to his honor, but not according to hers?!</p>
<p class="bas indent1"><span class="nm">(j)</span><span class="cl">Correction:</span> Rather, we bury even according to his honor.</p>
<p class="bas indent2"><span class="nm">1.</span>This teaches that she ascends with him and does not descend, even after she dies.</p>
<p class="bas indent1"><span class="nm">(k)</span><span class="cl">(Rav Masnah):</span> If one said 'if my wife dies (after me), do not bury her', we heed his words.</p>
<p class="bas indent1"><span class="nm">(l)</span><span class="cl">Question:</span> Do his words cause his property to fall to his heirs? Even had he said nothing, this would happen (and surely, they need not bury her)!</p>
<p class="bas indent1"><span class="nm">(m)</span><span class="cl">Correction:</span> Rather, if he says 'do not bury me from my property (Rashi - rather, from Tzedakah)', we ignore his words;</p>
<p class="bas indent2"><span class="nm">1.</span>He cannot benefit his children by imposing on the congregation.</p>
<p class="bas subject"><span class="nm">3)</span>ENTERING THE HUSBAND'S <i>RESHUS</i></p>
<p class="bas indent1"><span class="nm">(a)</span><span class="cl">(Mishnah):</span> A girl is always in her father's Reshus (jurisdiction), until she enters her husband's Reshus for Nisu'in;</p>
<p class="bas bbbline">48b----------------------------------------48b</p>
<p class="bas indent1"><span class="nm">(b)</span>If her father gave her over to her husband's Sheluchim, she is in her husband's Reshus;</p>
<p class="bas indent1"><span class="nm">(c)</span>If the father or his Sheluchim went with her husband's Sheluchim, she is in her father's Reshus;</p>
<p class="bas indent1"><span class="nm">(d)</span>If her father's Sheluchim gave her to the husband's Sheluchim, she is in her husband's Reshus.</p>
<p class="bas indent1"><span class="nm">(e)</span><span class="cl">(Gemara) Question:</span> Why does it say she is <i>always</i> in her father's Reshus?</p>
<p class="bas indent1"><span class="nm">(f)</span><span class="cl">Answer:</span> This shows that our Mishnah disagrees with the original version of the Mishnah:</p>
<p class="bas indent2"><span class="nm">1.</span><span class="cl">(Mishnah):</span> If the time that an Arus and his Arusah set for Nisu'in came and they were not married, she eats Terumah (if he is a Kohen) and is fed from his property.</p>
<p class="bas indent2"><span class="nm">2.</span>'Always' shows that our Mishnah argues.</p>
<p class="bas subject"><span class="nm">4)</span>FOR WHAT IS SHE GIVEN OVER?</p>
<p class="bas indent1"><span class="nm">(a)</span><span class="cl">(Mishnah):</span> If her father gave her over to the husband's Sheluchim, she is in her husband's Reshus.</p>
<p class="bas indent1"><span class="nm">(b)</span><span class="cl">(Rav):</span> She is given over for all laws, except for eating Terumah.</p>
<p class="bas indent1"><span class="nm">(c)</span><span class="cl">(Rav Asi):</span> She is given over even for Terumah.</p>
<p class="bas indent1"><span class="nm">(d)</span><span class="cl">Question (against Rav Asi - Rav Huna - Beraisa):</span> She is always in her father's Reshus, until she enters the Chupah.</p>
<p class="bas indent1"><span class="nm">(e)</span><span class="cl">Objection (Rav):</span> Do not challenge a teaching based on your understanding of a Mishnah or Beraisa that can be learned differently!</p>
<p class="bas indent2"><span class="nm">1.</span>Rav Asi can say that giving her over to the Sheluchim <i>is</i> entering Chupah!</p>
<p class="bas indent1"><span class="nm">(f)</span><span class="cl">(Shmuel):</span> After she is given over, the husband becomes her heir.</p>
<p class="bas indent1"><span class="nm">(g)</span><span class="cl">(Reish Lakish):</span> Giving her over is considered like Chupah regarding the Kesuvah.</p>
<p class="bas indent1"><span class="nm">(h)</span><span class="cl">Question:</span> What does this mean?</p>
<p class="bas indent2"><span class="nm">1.</span>If it means that he inherits the Kesuvah if she dies, this is just like Shmuel!</p>
<p class="bas indent1"><span class="nm">(i)</span><span class="cl">Answer (Ravina):</span> If she remarries (after becoming widowed or divorced) her Kesuvah from the new husband is 100.</p>
<p class="bas indent1"><span class="nm">(j)</span><span class="cl">(R. Yochanan):</span> She is given over for all laws of marriage, even Terumah.</p>
<p class="bas indent1"><span class="nm">(k)</span><span class="cl">Question (Beraisa):</span> If the father or his Sheluchim went with the husband's Sheluchim, or if she entered her courtyard with her husband to lodge, if she dies, her father inherits her. This is even if the husband has (the Metaltelim (movable objects) designated for) the Kesuvah (dowry);</p>
<p class="bas indent2"><span class="nm">1.</span>If the father or his Sheluchim gave her over to the husband's Sheluchim, or if she entered the husband's courtyard with him for Nisu'in, if she dies, her husband inherits her. This is even if her father has the Kesuvah.</p>
<p class="bas indent2"><span class="nm">2.</span>This applies only to inheritance. She may not eat Terumah until Chupah.</p>
<p class="bas indent2"><span class="nm">3.</span>This refutes all the Amora'im (other than Shmuel).</p>
<p class="bas indent1"><span class="nm">(l)</span><span class="cl">Question:</span> Contradictory inferences can be made from the Beraisa.</p>
<p class="bas indent2"><span class="nm">1.</span>'If she entered her courtyard with him to lodge' implies that Stam (unspecified), it is for Nisu'in!</p>
<p class="bas indent2"><span class="nm">2.</span>'If she entered his courtyard with him for Nisu'in' implies that Stam, it is to lodge!</p>
<p class="bas indent1"><span class="nm">(m)</span><span class="cl">Answer (Rav Ashi):</span> The Beraisa teaches the Stam cases;</p>
<p class="bas indent2"><span class="nm">1.</span>We assume that entering her courtyard is to lodge. Entering his is for Nisu'in.</p>
<p class="bas subject"><span class="nm">5)</span>CAPITAL PUNISHMENT</p>
<p class="bas indent1"><span class="nm">(a)</span><span class="cl">(Beraisa):</span> If her father gave her to the husband's Sheluchim and she was Mezanah, she is strangled.</p>
<p class="bas indent1"><span class="nm">(b)</span><span class="cl">(Rav Ami bar Chama):</span> "To be Mezanah in her father's house" excludes this case (from stoning).</p>
<p class="bas indent1"><span class="nm">(c)</span><span class="cl">Question:</span> Perhaps it excludes a girl that had Chupah without Bi'ah!</p>
<p class="bas indent1"><span class="nm">(d)</span><span class="cl">Answer (Rava citing Ami):</span> Another verse teaches that she is not stoned after Chupah:</p>
<p class="bas indent2"><span class="nm">1.</span>"Na'arah Besulah Me'orasah" excludes a Bogeres, a non-virgin and a Nesu'ah.</p>
<p class="bas indent3"><span class="nm">i.</span>If 'Nesu'ah' truly refers to a full Nesu'ah (after Chupah and Bi'ah), "Besulah" excludes her!</p>
<p class="bas indent2"><span class="nm">2.</span>Rather, "Me'orasah" excludes Chupah without Bi'ah.</p>
