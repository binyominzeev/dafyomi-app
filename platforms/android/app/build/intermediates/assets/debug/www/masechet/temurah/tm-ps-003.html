<p class="bas subject"><span class="nm">1)</span>KODSHIM OF NOCHRIM</p>
<p class="bas indent1"><span class="nm">(a)</span><span class="cl">(Beraisa - R. Shimon):</span> The following apply to Kodshim of Nochrim: one may not benefit from them, one who benefited did not transgress Me'ilah...</p>
<p class="bas indent1"><span class="nm">(b)</span>One may not benefit from them mid'Rabanan. There is no Me'ilah mid'Oraisa.</p>
<p class="bas indent1"><span class="nm">(c)</span><span class="cl">Question:</span> What is the reason?</p>
<p class="bas indent1"><span class="nm">(d)</span><span class="cl">Answer:</span> We learn from a Gezeirah Shavah "Chet-Chet" from Terumah;</p>
<p class="bas indent2"><span class="nm">1.</span>It says "Chet" regarding Me'ilah, like it says regarding Terumah;</p>
<p class="bas indent2"><span class="nm">2.</span>Regarding Terumah it says "Bnei Yisrael," to exclude (Terumah of) Nochrim.</p>
<p class="bas indent1"><span class="nm">(e)</span><span class="cl">(Beraisa):</span> One is not liable for them for Pigul, Nosar and Tamei.</p>
<p class="bas indent2"><span class="nm">1.</span>Regarding Tum'ah it says "va'Yinozru mi'Kodshei <i>Venei Yisrael</i>... v'Lo Yechalelu", to exclude Nochrim;</p>
<p class="bas indent2"><span class="nm">2.</span>It says regarding Nosar "v'Ochlav Avono Yisa Ki Es Kodesh Hash-m Chilel." We learn a Gezeirah Shavah "Chilul-Chilul" from Tum'ah;</p>
<p class="bas indent2"><span class="nm">3.</span>It says regarding Pigul "Avonah Tisa." We learn a Gezeirah Shavah "Avon-Avon" from Nosar.</p>
<p class="bas indent1"><span class="nm">(f)</span><span class="cl">(Beraisa):</span> Temurah does not apply to them.</p>
<p class="bas indent1"><span class="nm">(g)</span><span class="cl">Version #1:</span> Before the Parshah of Temurah it says "Daber El Bnei Yisrael Ish Ki Yafli Neder."</p>
<p class="bas indent1"><span class="nm">(h)</span><span class="cl">Version #2 - Question:</span> Why can't Nochrim make Temurah?</p>
<p class="bas indent1"><span class="nm">(i)</span><span class="cl">Answer:</span> Regarding Ma'aser of Degen (grain), it says "Bnei Yisrael," to exclude Nochrim;</p>
<p class="bas indent2"><span class="nm">1.</span>A Hekesh equates Ma'aser Behemah to Ma'aser Degen, and a Hekesh equates Temurah to Ma'aser Behemah.</p>
<p class="bas indent1"><span class="nm">(j)</span><span class="cl">(Beraisa - R. Shimon):</span> A Nochri may not bring Nesachim (some texts - alone), but his Korban requires Nesachim.</p>
<p class="bas indent1"><span class="nm">(k)</span><span class="cl">Question:</span> What is his reason?</p>
<p class="bas indent1"><span class="nm">(l)</span><span class="cl">Answer (Beraisa):</span> "Ezrach" teaches that only a Yisrael brings Nesachim;</p>
<p class="bas indent2"><span class="nm">1.</span><span class="cl">Suggestion:</span> Perhaps a Nochri's Olah does not require Nesachim!</p>
<p class="bas indent2"><span class="nm">2.</span><span class="cl">Rejection:</span> It says "Kachah". (It requires Nesachim. The Tzibur can (or must) bring them.)</p>
<p class="bas indent1"><span class="nm">(m)</span>R. Yosi is stringent concerning all of these.</p>
<p class="bas indent1"><span class="nm">(n)</span><span class="cl">Question:</span> What is the reason?</p>
<p class="bas indent1"><span class="nm">(o)</span><span class="cl">Answer:</span> It says "la'Shem" (to include Nochrim).</p>
<p class="bas indent1"><span class="nm">(p)</span><span class="cl">(Beraisa):</span> This applies to Kodshei Mizbe'ach, but Me'ilah applies to Kodshei Bedek ha'Bayis.</p>
<p class="bas indent1"><span class="nm">(q)</span><span class="cl">Question:</span> What is the reason?</p>
<p class="bas indent1"><span class="nm">(r)</span><span class="cl">Answer:</span> We learn Me'ilah from a Gezeirah Shavah "Chet-Chet" from Terumah;</p>
<p class="bas indent2"><span class="nm">1.</span>We learn only about Kodshei Mizbe'ach, which have Kedushas ha'Guf (intrinsic Kedushah) like Terumah, but not regarding Bedek ha'Bayis, which is Kedushas Damim. (Only its value is Kodesh.)</p>
<p class="bas subject"><span class="nm">2)</span>LASHES FOR A LAV SHE'EIN BO MA'ASEH</p>
<p class="bas indent1"><span class="nm">(a)</span><span class="cl">(Rav Yehudah):</span> Regarding every Lav in the Torah:</p>
<p class="bas indent2"><span class="nm">1.</span>If one transgressed through an action, he is liable. If not, he is exempt. (This refers to lashes, not to Lavim punishable by Misas Beis Din or paying money.)</p>
<p class="bas indent1"><span class="nm">(b)</span><span class="cl">Question:</span> This is not always true!</p>
<p class="bas indent2"><span class="nm">1.</span>Temurah is a Lav she'Ein Bo Ma'aseh, yet our Mishnah says "if one made Temurah, it takes effect, and he receives 40 lashes"!</p>
<p class="bas indent1"><span class="nm">(c)</span><span class="cl">Answer #1:</span> Our Mishnah is like R. Yehudah, who obligates lashes for a Lav she'Ein Bo Ma'aseh.</p>
<p class="bas indent1"><span class="nm">(d)</span><span class="cl">Question:</span> Our Mishnah says "everyone can make Temurah," to include an heir. This is unlike R. Yehudah!</p>
<p class="bas indent1"><span class="nm">(e)</span><span class="cl">Answer:</span> The Tana holds like R. Yehudah regarding Lav she'Ein Bo Ma'aseh. He argues with him about whether an heir can make Temurah and do Semichah.</p>
<p class="bas indent1"><span class="nm">(f)</span><span class="cl">(Rav Idi bar Avin):</span> If one transgressed any Lav of the Torah:</p>
<p class="bas indent2"><span class="nm">1.</span>If he did an action, he is lashed;</p>
<p class="bas indent2"><span class="nm">2.</span>If he did not do an action, he is not lashed, except for swearing falsely, Temurah, and cursing someone with Hash-m's name. He is liable for these, even without an action.</p>
<p class="bas indent2"><span class="nm">3.</span>R. Yosi b'Rebbi Chanina says, even one who designates Terumah before Bikurim (is lashed, even without an action).</p>
<p class="bas subject"><span class="nm">3)</span>LASHES FOR OATHS</p>
<p class="bas indent1"><span class="nm">(a)</span><span class="cl">Question:</span> What is the source to lash for swearing falsely?</p>
<p class="bas indent1"><span class="nm">(b)</span><span class="cl">Answer (R. Yochanan):</span> "(Lo Tisa... ) Ki Lo Yenakeh Hash-m... " - the Heavenly court does not cleanse (one who swore falsely), but Beis Din lashes and cleanses.</p>
<p class="bas bbbline">3b----------------------------------------3b</p>
<p class="bas indent1"><span class="nm">(c)</span><span class="cl">Question (Rav Papa):</span> Perhaps he will not be cleansed at all!</p>
<p class="bas indent1"><span class="nm">(d)</span><span class="cl">Answer (Abaye):</span> Had it only said "Lo Yenakeh," that would be correct;</p>
<p class="bas indent2"><span class="nm">1.</span>Rather, it says "Lo Yenakeh Hash-m." We infer that (a punishment from) Beis Din cleanses.</p>
<p class="bas indent1"><span class="nm">(e)</span><span class="cl">Question:</span> This teaches only that there are lashes for a Shav oath. What is the source for Sheker?</p>
<p class="bas indent1"><span class="nm">(f)</span><span class="cl">Answer (R. Yochanan):</span> It says twice "la'Shav";</p>
<p class="bas indent2"><span class="nm">1.</span>We use the extra one to teach about Sheker.</p>
<p class="bas indent1"><span class="nm">(g)</span><span class="cl">Question (R. Avahu):</span> What kind of Sheker do we learn about?</p>
<p class="bas indent2"><span class="nm">1.</span><span class="cl">Suggestion:</span> He swore "I will not eat", and he ate.</p>
<p class="bas indent2"><span class="nm">2.</span><span class="cl">Rejection:</span> He transgressed through an action. (We already know that he is lashed!)</p>
<p class="bas indent1"><span class="nm">(h)</span><span class="cl">Answer #1:</span> Rather, he swore "I will eat" and he did not eat.</p>
<p class="bas indent1"><span class="nm">(i)</span><span class="cl">Objection:</span> He is not lashed for this!</p>
<p class="bas indent2"><span class="nm">1.</span><span class="cl">(R. Yochanan and Reish Lakish):</span> If one swore "I will eat this loaf today" and he did not eat it, he is not lashed.</p>
<p class="bas indent3"><span class="nm">i.</span><span class="cl">(R. Yochanan):</span> He is not lashed because he transgressed without an action, one is not lashed for such a Lav;</p>
<p class="bas indent3"><span class="nm">ii.</span><span class="cl">(Reish Lakish):</span> He is not lashed because he did not receive definite warning. (He transgressed right before the day ends. No one knows precisely when this is.)</p>
<p class="bas indent1"><span class="nm">(j)</span><span class="cl">Answer #2 (R. Avahu):</span> Rather, he swore "I ate" or "I did not eat."</p>
<p class="bas indent1"><span class="nm">(k)</span><span class="cl">Question:</span> Also here, he transgressed without an action. Why is he lashed?</p>
<p class="bas indent1"><span class="nm">(l)</span><span class="cl">Answer (Rava):</span> The Torah teaches that one is lashed for Sheker that resembles Shav, i.e. in the past.</p>
<p class="bas indent1"><span class="nm">(m)</span><span class="cl">Question (against R. Avahu - R. Yirmeyah - Mishnah):</span> If Reuven said "I swear that I will not eat this loaf, I swear that I will not eat it, I swear that I will not eat it," and he ate it, he is liable for only one oath;</p>
<p class="bas indent2"><span class="nm">1.</span><i>This</i> is the Shevu'ah of Bituy for which one is lashed if he was Mezid, and brings a Korban Oleh v'Yored for Shogeg.</p>
<p class="bas indent2"><span class="nm">2.</span><span class="cl">Suggestion:</span> "This" excludes "I ate" or "I did not eat." He is not lashed for them!</p>
<p class="bas indent1"><span class="nm">(n)</span><span class="cl">Answer #1:</span> No, it excludes "I ate" or "I did not eat," for he does not bring a Korban for them;</p>
<p class="bas indent2"><span class="nm">1.</span>The Mishnah is R. Yishmael, who says that a Korban is brought only for oaths about the future;</p>
<p class="bas indent2"><span class="nm">2.</span>He is lashed for "I ate" or "I did not eat."</p>
<p class="bas indent2"><span class="nm">3.</span><span class="cl">Question (Seifa):</span> <i>This</i> is the Shevu'as Shav for which there are lashes, but no Korban;</p>
<p class="bas indent3"><span class="nm">i.</span><span class="cl">Suggestion:</span> This excludes "I ate" or "I did not eat." He is not lashed for them!</p>
<p class="bas indent2"><span class="nm">4.</span><span class="cl">Answer:</span> No, it excludes "I ate" or "I did not eat," to teach that he brings a Korban for them;</p>
<p class="bas indent3"><span class="nm">i.</span>This is like R. Akiva, who obligates a Korban for the past just like for the future.</p>
<p class="bas indent2"><span class="nm">5.</span><span class="cl">Objection:</span> Is the Reisha R. Yishmael, and the Seifa R. Akiva?!</p>
<p class="bas indent1"><span class="nm">(o)</span><span class="cl">Answer #2:</span> Since the Seifa is R. Akiva, also the Reisha is R. Akiva;</p>
<p class="bas indent2"><span class="nm">1.</span>The Reisha does not exclude "I ate" or "I did not eat" from a Korban, rather it excludes "I will eat" from lashes (since he transgresses through inaction, i.e. not eating, but he brings a Korban for Shogeg. Our texts of Rashi and Tosfos explain just the contrary. It excludes "I will eat" from Korban, but he is lashed. Chok Nasan and Sefas Emes say that this is a mistake; the texts should read like we explained.)</p>
<p class="bas indent1"><span class="nm">(p)</span><span class="cl">Version #1 (Rashi) Question:</span> Why do we say that the Reisha excludes "I will eat" from lashes, and the Seifa includes "I ate" and "I did not eat" for Korban (and not vice-versa)?</p>
<p class="bas indent1"><span class="nm">(q)</span><span class="cl">Version #2 (Tosfos) Question:</span> Why don't we answer that the entire Mishnah is R. Yishmael; the Reisha excludes "I ate" and "I did not eat" from Korban, the Seifa excludes them from lashes? (end of Version #2)</p>
<p class="bas indent1"><span class="nm">(r)</span><span class="cl">Answer:</span> The Reisha discusses an oath of the future. Presumably it excludes an oath of the future.</p>

<p class="bas indent1"><span class="nm">(a)</span>(Rav Idi bar Avin citing R. Yosi ha'Gelili):... Except for Temurah...</p>
<p class="bas indent1"><span class="nm">(b)</span><span class="cl">R. Yochanan (to a reciter of Beraisos):</span> Do not include Temurah (among the exceptions), for his words do an action (they are Makdish an animal. According to our text (3a), R. Yochanan was part of the chain citing R. Yosi ha'Gelili to say that Temurah is an exception! This is not difficult according to the text in the margin (there) that replaces "R. Yochanan" with "R.

<p class="bas indent2"><span class="nm">1.</span><span class="cl">Answer:</span> It refers to lashes - "v'Hipilo ha'Shofet v'Hikahu."</p>
<p class="bas indent2"><span class="nm">2.</span><span class="cl">Suggestion:</span> Perhaps one is lashed even for a true oath!</p>
<p class="bas indent2"><span class="nm">3.</span><span class="cl">Rejection:</span> The Torah commands to swear (sometimes) - "Shevu'as Hash-m Tihyeh Bein Sheneihem."</p>
<p class="bas indent2"><span class="nm">4.</span><span class="cl">Suggestion:</span> Perhaps that is to appease the other party, but one is lashed for it!</p>

<p class="bas indent3"><span class="nm">ii.</span><span class="cl">Answer:</span> We learn from "Nishbati va'Akayemah Lishmor Mishpetei Tzidkecha." (Really, the Heter must be from a verse in the Chumash, i.e. "uvi'Shemo Tishave'a.")</p>
