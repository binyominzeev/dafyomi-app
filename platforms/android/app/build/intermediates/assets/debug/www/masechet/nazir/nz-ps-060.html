<p class="bas subject"><span class="nm">1)</span>A NAZIR WHO IS SAFEK TAMEI AND SAFEK MUCHLAT</p>
<p class="bas indent1"><span class="nm">(a)</span><span class="cl">(Mishnah):</span> If a Nazir was Safek Tamei (Mes), and was a Safek Metzora Muchlat, he may eat Kodshim after 60 days, and drink wine and be Metamei after 120 days.</p>
<p class="bas indent2"><span class="nm">1.</span>This is because the Aseh for a definite Metzora to shave overrides the Isur for a Nazir to shave, but a Safek Metzora who is a Nazir may not shave.</p>
<p class="bas indent1"><span class="nm">(b)</span><span class="cl">(Beraisa):</span> This applies to a 30 day Nezirus. If he accepted a year of Nezirus, he may eat Kodshim after two years and drink wine and be Metamei after four years.</p>
<p class="bas indent1"><span class="nm">(c)</span><span class="cl">(Beraisa):</span> He shaves four times:</p>
<p class="bas indent2"><span class="nm">1.</span>The first time, he brings Tziporim, Chatas ha'Of, and Olas Beheimah. (The Tziporim (birds) are not Korbanos. They are used in a ritual to permit a Muchlat to enter the city after his Tzara'as went away.)</p>
<p class="bas indent2"><span class="nm">2.</span>The second time, he brings Chatas ha'Of and Olas Beheimah;</p>
<p class="bas indent2"><span class="nm">3.</span>The third time, he brings Chatas ha'Of and Olas Beheimah;</p>
<p class="bas indent2"><span class="nm">4.</span>The fourth time, he brings Korbanos Nazir Tahor.</p>
<p class="bas indent1"><span class="nm">(d)</span>Whether or not he was a Muchlat, whether or not he was Tamei, he does not transgress bringing invalid Korbanos.</p>
<p class="bas indent1"><span class="nm">(e)</span><span class="cl">The first time:</span> if he really was an (absolute) Metzora, the Tziporim were brought properly. The Safek Chatas ha'Of is not eaten, rather buried. The Olah is a Nedavah;</p>
<p class="bas indent2"><span class="nm">1.</span>He cannot shave after only seven days (like a Muchlat whose Tzara'as went away), lest he was not a Muchlat, rather a Tahor Nazir, who cannot shave until finishing Nezirus.</p>
<p class="bas indent2"><span class="nm">2.</span>If he was not a Muchlat, but was Tamei Mes, the Chatas ha'Of was obligatory. The Tziporim were not offered in the Mikdash, so there is no Isur of offering them needlessly. The Olah was a Nedavah.</p>
<p class="bas indent2"><span class="nm">3.</span>If he was not a Muchlat, and was Tahor, the Tziporim were no problem (like above). The Chatas ha'Of was not eaten, rather buried. The Olas Beheimah was part of the obligatory Korban of a Nazir.</p>
<p class="bas indent1"><span class="nm">(f)</span><span class="cl">Question:</span> He must bring also a Korban Asham! (A Metzora must bring an Asham before he may eat Kodshim!)</p>
<p class="bas indent1"><span class="nm">(g)</span><span class="cl">Answer:</span> The Beraisa is like R. Shimon, who says that he may stipulate (if he does not need an Asham, it should be a Shelamim Nedavah).</p>
<p class="bas indent1"><span class="nm">(h)</span>The second and third times, he need not bring Tziporim, for he already brought them!</p>
<p class="bas indent2"><span class="nm">1.</span>Both times he brings Chatas ha'Of. (The second time,) perhaps he needs it because he finished the seven days of Sefirah of a Metzora. (The second and third time,) perhaps he needs it because he was a Tamei Nazir.</p>
<p class="bas indent1"><span class="nm">(i)</span>The fourth time, he brings Korbanos Nazir Tahor and stipulates as follows:</p>
<p class="bas bbbline">60b----------------------------------------60b</p>
<p class="bas indent2"><span class="nm">1.</span>If he was initially a Nazir Tahor (i.e. he was not a Metzora, and he was not Tamei), he brought his obligatory Olah the first time, so the Olah he brings now is a Nedavah;</p>
<p class="bas indent2"><span class="nm">2.</span>If he was a Muchlat and was Tamei, all the Olos he brought were Nedavah, and the current Olah is obligatory.</p>
<p class="bas indent3"><span class="nm">i.</span>In either case, he also brings the other Korbanos Nazir Tahor.</p>
<p class="bas subject"><span class="nm">2)</span>DEFINITE <i>TZARA'AS</i> OR <i>TUM'AH</i></p>
<p class="bas indent1"><span class="nm">(a)</span>If he was Safek Tamei and definitely a (Muchlat) Metzora, he may eat Kodshim after eight days, and drink wine and be Metamei after 67 days;</p>
<p class="bas indent1"><span class="nm">(b)</span>If he was a Safek Metzora and definitely Tamei, he may eat Kodshim after 37 days, and drink wine and be Metamei after 74 days;</p>
<p class="bas indent1"><span class="nm">(c)</span>If he was definitely Tamei and a Metzora, he may eat Kodshim after eight days, and drink wine and be Metamei after 44 days.</p>
<p class="bas subject"><span class="nm">3)</span>CAN ONE SHAVING COUNT TWICE?</p>
<p class="bas indent1"><span class="nm">(a)</span><span class="cl">(Beraisa) Question:</span> When a Metzora Nazir Tahor shaves at the end of Tzara'as, can this also count for Tiglachas (upon completing) Nezirus Taharah?</p>
<p class="bas indent1"><span class="nm">(b)</span><span class="cl">Answer (R. Shimon bar Yochai):</span> No. At the end of Tzara'as, he shaves in order to grow his hair again (so he can shave after Sefirah); when he shaves upon completing Nezirus, he need not grow his hair again.</p>
<p class="bas indent1"><span class="nm">(c)</span><span class="cl">Question:</span> This applies to shaving before Sefirah. When he shaves after Sefirah (he need not grow his hair again), this should also count for the shaving upon completing Nezirus!</p>
<p class="bas indent1"><span class="nm">(d)</span><span class="cl">Answer (R. Shimon bar Yochai):</span> No. A cured Metzora shaves before he brings Korbanos. A Nazir shaves after bringing a Korban.</p>
<p class="bas indent1"><span class="nm">(e)</span><span class="cl">Version #1 - Question:</span> This shows that the Tiglachas Metzora should not also count for Tiglachas Nazir Tahor; but it should count for Tiglachas Nazir Tamei (who brings Korbanos after shaving)!</p>
<p class="bas indent1"><span class="nm">(f)</span><span class="cl">Answer (R. Shimon bar Yochai):</span> No. A Nazir Tamei immerses before shaving. A cured Metzora shaves after immersing.</p>
<p class="bas indent1"><span class="nm">(g)</span><span class="cl">Version #2 - Question:</span> You have shown that Tiglachas Metzora after Sefirah does not count for Tiglachas Nazir Tahor; but the Tiglachas before Sefirah should count for Tiglachas Nazir Tamei, since both must grow hair to shave again!</p>
<p class="bas indent1"><span class="nm">(h)</span><span class="cl">Answer (R. Shimon bar Yochai):</span> The Tiglachas of a cured Metzora can never count for Tiglachas Nezirus.</p>
<p class="bas indent2"><span class="nm">1.</span>It cannot count for Tiglachas Nazir Tahor, because a cured Metzora shaves to grow his hair, and a Nazir Tahor need not grow hair again.</p>
<p class="bas indent2"><span class="nm">2.</span>It cannot count for Tiglachas Nazir Tamei, because a cured Metzora shaves before immersing, and a Nazir Tamei shaves after immersing.</p>
