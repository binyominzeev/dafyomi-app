<p class="bas subject"><span class="nm">1)</span>THINGS THAT MIGHT CONTAIN WINE OF NOCHRIM</p>
<p class="bas indent1"><span class="nm">(a)</span><span class="cl">(Rav Yosef):</span> Beer vinegar of Nochrim is forbidden, for they mix dregs of their wine with it;</p>
<p class="bas indent1"><span class="nm">(b)</span><span class="cl">(Rav Ashi):</span> If one sees it taken straight from the (large storage) barrel, it is permitted. They would not mix in wine, for this makes it spoil quickly.</p>
<p class="bas indent1"><span class="nm">(c)</span><span class="cl">(Mishnah):</span> Hadriyani earthenware...</p>
<p class="bas indent1"><span class="nm">(d)</span><span class="cl">Question:</span> What is this?</p>
<p class="bas indent1"><span class="nm">(e)</span><span class="cl">Answer (Rav Yehudah):</span> It is earthenware of Hadriyanus Keisar.</p>
<p class="bas indent1"><span class="nm">(f)</span><span class="cl">(Rav Dimi):</span> They grow vines in virgin soil (that was never farmed), make wine from the grapes, soak earthenware in the wine, and it absorbs the wine. They break the Kelim and take the shards. When they want wine, they soak the shards in water, and wine exudes.</p>
<p class="bas indent2"><span class="nm">1.</span><span class="cl">(R. Yehoshua ben Levi):</span> The third time they soak them, the resulting wine is as good as our best quality wine!</p>
<p class="bas indent1"><span class="nm">(g)</span><span class="cl">Question:</span> May one use these shards to support a bed?</p>
<p class="bas indent2"><span class="nm">1.</span>May one use something that contains Isur Hana'ah (something one may not benefit from), if he does not benefit from the Isur?</p>
<p class="bas indent1"><span class="nm">(h)</span><span class="cl">Answer #1:</span> R. Elazar and R. Yochanan argued about this. One permitted, and one forbade. (The Halachah follows the one who forbids - some delete this from the text.)</p>
<p class="bas indent1"><span class="nm">(i)</span><span class="cl">Question (against the one who permits - Beraisa #1):</span> If wine of a Yisrael was put in small flasks and leather pouches of Nochrim, one may not drink the wine, but one may benefit from them;</p>
<p class="bas indent2"><span class="nm">1.</span>Shimon ben Guda testified in front of Raban Gamliel's son that Raban Gamliel drank from it in Ako. They did not agree to this.</p>
<p class="bas indent2"><span class="nm">2.</span>R. Shimon ben Gamliel says (in the name of) R. Yehoshua ben Kafosai that one may not make a saddle out of pouches of Nochrim.</p>
<p class="bas indent2"><span class="nm">3.</span>The Beraisa forbids using the pouch, even in a way that he will not benefit from the wine!</p>
<p class="bas indent2"><span class="nm">4.</span><span class="cl">(Counter-question:</span> If so, also the flasks should be forbidden! - Tosfos deletes this from the text.)</p>
<p class="bas indent1"><span class="nm">(j)</span><span class="cl">Answer (Rava):</span> It is a decree not to make a saddle out of the pouches, lest a pouch (of the Yisrael) break and he will tear off part of the saddle to patch it (and the Nochri wine from the saddle will enter the Yisrael's wine).</p>
<p class="bas indent1"><span class="nm">(k)</span><span class="cl">Question:</span> According to the opinion that one may not benefit (even without benefiting from the Isur), why is Hadriyani earthenware forbidden, but bottles are permitted?</p>
<p class="bas indent1"><span class="nm">(l)</span><span class="cl">Answer:</span> Regarding Hadriyani earthenware, the forbidden wine is intact (through soaking, one gets proper wine). Wine absorbed in bottles cannot be recovered by itself (it can only give taste to something).</p>
<p class="bas indent1"><span class="nm">(m)</span><span class="cl">(Beraisa #1):</span> They did not agree to this.</p>
<p class="bas indent1"><span class="nm">(n)</span><span class="cl">Contradiction (Beraisa #2):</span> One may not drink wine put in pouches of Nochrim, but one may benefit from the pouches;</p>
<p class="bas indent2"><span class="nm">1.</span>Shimon ben Gude'a testified in front of Raban Gamliel's son that Raban Gamliel drank from it in Ako; they agreed to this.</p>
<p class="bas indent1"><span class="nm">(o)</span><span class="cl">Answer #1:</span> (In Beraisa #1) all his colleagues did not agree, but his son agreed.</p>
<p class="bas indent1"><span class="nm">(p)</span><span class="cl">Answer #2:</span> Shimon ben <i>Goda</i> is not Shimon ben <i>Gude'a</i>. When the latter testified, they agreed.</p>
<p class="bas subject"><span class="nm">2)</span>HIDES WITH A HOLE</p>
<p class="bas indent1"><span class="nm">(a)</span><span class="cl">(Mishnah):</span> Hides with a hole near the heart.</p>
<p class="bas indent1"><span class="nm">(b)</span><span class="cl">(Beraisa):</span> If a hide has a hole (like a window) near the heart (from which the heart could be removed), and there is a crust of blood, it is forbidden;</p>
<p class="bas bbbline">32b----------------------------------------32b</p>
<p class="bas indent2"><span class="nm">1.</span>If not, it is permitted.</p>
<p class="bas indent1"><span class="nm">(c)</span><span class="cl">(Rav Huna):</span> This is only if the hide was not salted;</p>
<p class="bas indent2"><span class="nm">1.</span>If it was salted, it is forbidden. Perhaps there was a crust and the salt removed it.</p>
<p class="bas indent1"><span class="nm">(d)</span><span class="cl">(Mishnah - R. Shimon ben Gamliel):</span> If the hole is round it is forbidden. If it is long and narrow, it is permitted.</p>
<p class="bas indent1"><span class="nm">(e)</span><span class="cl">(Rav Yosef):</span> The Halachah follows R. Shimon ben Gamliel.</p>
<p class="bas indent2"><span class="nm">1.</span><span class="cl">Inference (Abaye):</span> This implies that Chachamim argue with him!</p>
<p class="bas indent2"><span class="nm">2.</span><span class="cl">Rav Yosef:</span> What difference does it make? (In any case, the Halachah follows R. Shimon!)</p>
<p class="bas indent2"><span class="nm">3.</span><span class="cl">Abaye:</span> Should we recite teachings (that are not needed,) like a song?!</p>
<p class="bas indent1"><span class="nm">(f)</span><span class="cl">(Mishnah - R. Akiva):</span> Meat being taken to (where they serve) idolatry is permitted.</p>
<p class="bas indent1"><span class="nm">(g)</span><span class="cl">Question:</span> Like whom does R. Akiva hold?</p>
<p class="bas indent1"><span class="nm">(h)</span><span class="cl">Answer (R. Chiya bar Aba):</span> He argues with R. Eliezer, who says that everything a Nochri does (Tosfos - slaughters) is for the sake of idolatry.</p>
<p class="bas indent1"><span class="nm">(i)</span><span class="cl">(Mishnah - R. Akiva):</span> What is taken from it is forbidden, for it is like something sacrificed to idolatry.</p>
<p class="bas indent1"><span class="nm">(j)</span><span class="cl">Question:</span> What is the reason?</p>
<p class="bas indent1"><span class="nm">(k)</span><span class="cl">Answer:</span> Surely, it was offered to idolatry. R. Akiva holds like R. Yehudah ben Beseira.</p>
<p class="bas indent2"><span class="nm">1.</span><span class="cl">(R. Yehudah ben Beseira):</span> Something offered to idolatry has Tum'as Ohel (makes Tamei everything under the same roof with it). It says "... va'Yochelu Zivchei Mesim" - just like a corpse has Tum'as Ohel, also what is offered to idolatry.</p>
