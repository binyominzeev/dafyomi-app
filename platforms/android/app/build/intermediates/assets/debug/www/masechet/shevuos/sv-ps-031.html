<p class="bas subject"><span class="nm">1)</span>FALSE MATTERS (cont.)</p>
<p class="bas indent1"><span class="nm">(a)</span><span class="cl">(Continuation of Beraisa):</span> We learn the following laws from "mi'Devar Sheker Tirchak";</p>
<p class="bas indent2"><span class="nm">1.</span>If a Talmid in front of the judge sees why the poor person is innocent and the rich person is liable, he may not keep quiet;</p>
<p class="bas indent2"><span class="nm">2.</span>If a Talmid sees that the judge is erring, he may not wait until a wrong verdict is given and then show what the verdict should be, in order that people will say the verdict in his name;</p>
<p class="bas indent2"><span class="nm">3.</span>If a Rebbi told his Talmid 'you know that I would not lie for a fortune. Reuven owes me money, and I only have one witness against him', the Talmid may not join with the witness.</p>
<p class="bas indent2"><span class="nm">4.</span><span class="cl">Objection:</span> "Lo Sa'aneh b'Re'echa Ed Shaker" teaches this, and not "mi'Devar Sheker Tirchak"!</p>
<p class="bas indent2"><span class="nm">5.</span><span class="cl">Correction:</span> Rather, even if the Rebbi asks 'just stand with my witness, to make Reuven think that I have two witnesses (so he will admit)', it is forbidden.</p>
<p class="bas indent2"><span class="nm">6.</span>If Shimon owes Levi 100, Levi may not claim 200 in order that Shimon will (deny half and) have to swear, enabling Levi to force Shimon to swear about another matter. (This is the law of Gilgul Shevu'ah. When Shimon must swear to Levi, Levi can demand that Shimon swear about other claims as well);</p>
<p class="bas indent2"><span class="nm">7.</span>If Shimon owes Levi 100 and Levi claimed 200, Shimon may not deny the entire claim in Beis Din and admit to Levi outside of Beis Din, to exempt himself from the oath of partial admission (lest Levi force Shimon to swear through Gilgul about another matter);</p>
<p class="bas indent2"><span class="nm">8.</span>If Reuven owes money to three partners and denies it, one may not claim the entire amount and bring the others for witnesses (in order to share the money with them).</p>
<p class="bas indent2"><span class="nm">9.</span>If Shimon is dressed in rags, and Levi (his opponent) is wearing very expensive clothing, Levi must supply Shimon with clothing like he is wearing, or also he must dress in rags.</p>
<p class="bas indent3"><span class="nm">i.</span>Rabah bar Rav Huna would tell a litigant to remove his linen shoes before he would hear the case.</p>
<p class="bas indent2"><span class="nm">10.</span>A judge may not hear one party before the other party comes.</p>
<p class="bas indent2"><span class="nm">11.</span>A party may not justify its claim to the judge before the other party comes.</p>
<p class="bas indent3"><span class="nm">i.</span>Rav Kahana learns the last two Isurim from "Lo Sisa Shema Shav" (do not hear a vain report; this may also be read 'Lo Sasi', do not give a vain report).</p>
<p class="bas indent1"><span class="nm">(b)</span><span class="cl">(Rav):</span> "Lo Tov Asah b'Soch Amav" is one who pleads on behalf of another through Harsha'ah (authorization; Tosfos - i.e. when he accepts Harsha'ah because he is more likely to win in Beis Din, but it is a Mitzvah to accept Harsha'ah for a litigant who cannot come to Beis Din.)</p>
<p class="bas indent1"><span class="nm">(c)</span><span class="cl">(Shmuel):</span> This is one who buys a contested field (confident that he will win in Beis Din, for he is powerful).</p>
<p class="bas subject"><span class="nm">2)</span>LIABILITY FOR SHEVU'AS HA'EDUS</p>
<p class="bas indent1"><span class="nm">(a)</span><span class="cl">(Mishnah):</span> Shevu'as ha'Edus applies only to people proper to testify.</p>
<p class="bas indent1"><span class="nm">(b)</span><span class="cl">Question:</span> What does this come to exclude?</p>
<p class="bas indent1"><span class="nm">(c)</span><span class="cl">Answer #1 (Rav Papa):</span> It excludes a king. (He cannot testify, because it is below his honor to stand.)</p>
<p class="bas indent1"><span class="nm">(d)</span><span class="cl">Answer #2 (Rav Acha bar Yakov):</span> It excludes a dice-player. (Mid'Rabanan, gambling winnings are considered theft, because the loser did not resolve to forfeit his money if he loses.)</p>
<p class="bas indent2"><span class="nm">1.</span>Rav Acha excludes even someone disqualified mid'Rabanan, and all the more so a king who is disqualified mid'Oraisa;</p>
<p class="bas indent2"><span class="nm">2.</span>Rav Papa excludes a king, who is disqualified mid'Oraisa. He would say that a dice-player, who is only disqualified mid'Rabanan, is liable for Shevu'as ha'Edus.</p>
<p class="bas indent1"><span class="nm">(e)</span><span class="cl">(Mishnah - R. Meir):</span> (When he swears himself) he is liable in or outside of Beis Din... (Chachamim say, whether he swears himself or the oath is imposed on him, he is liable only if he denies in Beis Din).</p>
<p class="bas indent1"><span class="nm">(f)</span><span class="cl">Question:</span> What do they argue about?</p>
<p class="bas indent1"><span class="nm">(g)</span><span class="cl">Answer #1 (Rabanan):</span> R. Meir holds 'Dun Minah u'Minah' (when a matter is learned from another matter, we copy (learn) the entire framework of the source). Chachamim hold 'Dun Minah v'Uki b'Asra' (when we learn a law, we apply it to the framework of the matter being learned).</p>
<p class="bas indent2"><span class="nm">1.</span>R. Meir learns, just like Shevu'as ha'Pikadon applies when he swears himself, also Shevu'as ha'Edus;</p>
<p class="bas indent3"><span class="nm">i.</span>Also, just like Shevu'as ha'Pikadon applies in or outside of Beis Din, also Shevu'as ha'Edus.</p>
<p class="bas indent2"><span class="nm">2.</span>Chachamim also learn, just like Shevu'as ha'Pikadon applies when he swears himself, also Shevu'as ha'Edus;</p>
<p class="bas indent3"><span class="nm">i.</span>However, they apply this to the framework of Shevu'as ha'Edus (the Torah discusses an oath imposed on a witness, and this is only in Beis Din).</p>
<p class="bas bbbline">31b----------------------------------------31b</p>
<p class="bas indent1"><span class="nm">(h)</span><span class="cl">Rejection (Rav Papa):</span> Also Chachamim hold Dun Minah u'Minah. If they learned Shevu'as ha'Edus from Shevu'as ha'Pikadon, they would agree with R. Meir;</p>
<p class="bas indent1"><span class="nm">(i)</span><span class="cl">Answer #2 (Rav Papa):</span> (R. Meir learns as above.) Chachamim learn from a Kal va'Chomer;</p>
<p class="bas indent2"><span class="nm">1.</span>One is liable even when the oath is imposed on him, and all the more so if he swears himself!</p>
<p class="bas indent2"><span class="nm">2.</span>The principle of 'Dayo' says that we cannot learn more than the source of the Kal va'Chomer. When the oath is imposed on him, he is liable only in Beis Din, also when he swears himself.</p>
<p class="bas indent1"><span class="nm">(j)</span><span class="cl">Objection (Rabanan):</span> Chachamim surely hold Dun Minah v'Uki b'Asra!</p>
<p class="bas indent2"><span class="nm">1.</span><span class="cl">(Mishnah - R. Meir):</span> Shevu'as ha'Pikadon (the oath of watchmen) applies to men and women, to strangers and relatives, to Kosher and invalid witnesses;</p>
<p class="bas indent3"><span class="nm">i.</span>When he swears himself, it applies in or outside of Beis Din. If the oath is imposed on him, he is liable only if he denies in Beis Din.</p>
<p class="bas indent2"><span class="nm">2.</span>Chachamim say, whether he swears himself or the oath is imposed on him, he is liable (even outside of Beis Din).</p>
<p class="bas indent2"><span class="nm">3.</span><span class="cl">Question:</span> What is Chachamim's source that one is liable if the oath is imposed on him?</p>
<p class="bas indent2"><span class="nm">4.</span><span class="cl">Answer:</span> They learn from Shevu'as ha'Edus, but they apply to it the law of Shevu'as ha'Pikadon (to be liable everywhere)!</p>
<p class="bas indent1"><span class="nm">(k)</span><span class="cl">Answer (Rav Papa):</span> Indeed, from there you can prove that Chachamim hold Dun Minah v'Uki b'Asra, but not from our Mishnah. (Tosfos - and from our Mishnah you can prove that R. Meir holds Dun Minah u'Minah.)</p>
<p class="bas subject"><span class="nm">3)</span>LIABILITY OF SHOGEG AND MEZID</p>
<p class="bas indent1"><span class="nm">(a)</span><span class="cl">(Mishnah):</span> One is liable (for swearing falsely) b'Mezid (or b'Shogeg, when he knew the testimony).</p>
<p class="bas indent1"><span class="nm">(b)</span><span class="cl">Question:</span> What is the source of this?</p>
<p class="bas indent1"><span class="nm">(c)</span><span class="cl">Answer (Beraisa):</span> It does not say 'v'Ne'elam' regarding Shevu'as ha'Edus, like it says in the other Parshiyos of Oleh v'Yored, to teach that one is liable for Mezid just like for Shogeg.</p>
<p class="bas indent1"><span class="nm">(d)</span><span class="cl">(Mishnah):</span> He is liable also for Shogeg about the oath, if he remembers the testimony.</p>
<p class="bas indent1"><span class="nm">(e)</span><span class="cl">Question:</span> What is this case?</p>
<p class="bas indent1"><span class="nm">(f)</span><span class="cl">Answer (Rav Yehudah):</span> He knows that one may not swear falsely, but he does not remember if he is liable for this.</p>
<p class="bas indent1"><span class="nm">(g)</span><span class="cl">(Mishnah):</span> He is exempt if he was totally Shogeg.</p>
<p class="bas indent1"><span class="nm">(h)</span><span class="cl">Suggestion:</span> Our Mishnah proves that Rav Kahana or Rav Asi (who swore about what he thought Rav said, and was wrong (26a)) was guiltless! (If so, why was he worried?)</p>
<p class="bas indent1"><span class="nm">(i)</span><span class="cl">Rejection:</span> No. Our Mishnah exempts regarding Shevu'as ha'Edus, about which it does not say 'v'Nelam', therefore he is exempt if he forgot;</p>
<p class="bas indent2"><span class="nm">1.</span>Regarding oaths of Bituy, about which it says "v'Nelam", one might have thought that he is liable even when he mistakenly swore falsely. Rav had to tell him that this is not so.</p>
<p class="bas subject"><span class="nm">4)</span>THE OATH</p>
<p class="bas indent1"><span class="nm">(a)</span><span class="cl">(Mishnah):</span> Shevu'as ha'Edus is when Reuven told the witnesses 'come testify for me', and they <i>swore</i> 'we do not know testimony for you';</p>
<p class="bas indent2"><span class="nm">1.</span>Alternatively, they <i>said</i> 'we do not know testimony for you', and Reuven said 'I impose this on you in an oath', and they answered 'Amen'';</p>
<p class="bas indent2"><span class="nm">2.</span>(If they were lying) they are liable.</p>
<p class="bas indent1"><span class="nm">(b)</span>If Reuven made them swear five times outside of Beis Din, and they came to Beis Din and admitted that they know, they are exempt;</p>
<p class="bas indent2"><span class="nm">1.</span>If they denied knowing, they are liable for each oath.</p>
<p class="bas indent1"><span class="nm">(c)</span>If Reuven made them swear five times in Beis Din, they are liable only once.</p>
<p class="bas indent1"><span class="nm">(d)</span>R. Shimon says, this is because once they swear that they do not know, they can no longer testify.</p>
<p class="bas indent1"><span class="nm">(e)</span>If both witnesses simultaneously denied knowing, they are liable. If one denied after the other, the first is liable, and the latter is exempt;</p>
<p class="bas indent1"><span class="nm">(f)</span>If one denied and the other admitted knowing, the denier is liable, the one who admitted is exempt.</p>
<p class="bas indent1"><span class="nm">(g)</span>If there were two pairs of witnesses, and one pair denied after the other, both pairs are liable, for either pair could have testified.</p>
