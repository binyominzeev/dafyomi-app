<p class="bas subject"><span class="nm">1)</span>A PURCHASE OR GIFT IS EXEMPT FROM <i>MA'ASER</i></p>
<p class="bas indent1"><span class="nm">(a)</span><span class="cl">(Mishnah):</span> If one bought or received a gift of animals, they are exempt from Ma'aser.</p>
<p class="bas indent1"><span class="nm">(b)</span><span class="cl">(Gemara) Question:</span> What is the source of this?</p>
<p class="bas indent1"><span class="nm">(c)</span><span class="cl">Answer (Rav Kahana):</span> "Bechor Banecha Titen Li; Ken Ta'aseh l'Shorcha l'Tzonecha" teaches that just like people are not sold or given, likewise, Ma'aser Behemah does not apply to a purchase or gift.</p>
<p class="bas indent1"><span class="nm">(d)</span><span class="cl">Question:</span> The verse discusses Bechor (and not Ma'aser. Also, the exemption of a purchase or gift does not apply to Bechor Behemah, for it is Kodesh from birth!)</p>
<p class="bas indent1"><span class="nm">(e)</span><span class="cl">Answer:</span> It says "Ken Ta'aseh." Since we do not need it to teach about Bechor (which is Kodesh by itself), we use it to teach about Ma'aser.</p>
<p class="bas indent1"><span class="nm">(f)</span><span class="cl">Suggestion:</span> Perhaps we should use it to teach about Chatas and Asham (that they may not come from purchased animals)!</p>
<p class="bas indent1"><span class="nm">(g)</span><span class="cl">Answer:</span> We learn about a Korban resembling a son. It is not due to sin.</p>
<p class="bas indent1"><span class="nm">(h)</span><span class="cl">Suggestion:</span> Perhaps it should teach about Olah and Shelamim!</p>
<p class="bas indent1"><span class="nm">(i)</span><span class="cl">Answer:</span> We learn about a Korban resembling a son. It is not due to a vow.</p>
<p class="bas indent1"><span class="nm">(j)</span><span class="cl">Suggestion:</span> Perhaps it should teach about Olas Re'iyah!</p>
<p class="bas indent1"><span class="nm">(k)</span><span class="cl">Answer:</span> We learn about a Korban resembling a son. It does not have a fixed time.</p>
<p class="bas indent1"><span class="nm">(l)</span><span class="cl">Suggestion:</span> Since we learn from a son, which is not bought, we should say that Ma'aser can never come from something bought;</p>
<p class="bas indent2"><span class="nm">1.</span>R. Asi taught that if one bought 10 fetuses inside their mother, all enter the pen for Ma'aser!</p>
<p class="bas indent1"><span class="nm">(m)</span><span class="cl">Answer (Rava):</span> It says "Ta'aseh". At the time of action (taking Ma'aser, after they are born) a sale exempts from Ma'aser (but not before this).</p>
<p class="bas indent1"><span class="nm">(n)</span><span class="cl">(R. Asi citing R. Yochanan):</span> If one bought 10 fetuses inside their mother, all enter the pen for Ma'aser.</p>
<p class="bas indent1"><span class="nm">(o)</span><span class="cl">Question (Mishnah):</span> If one bought or received a gift of animals, they are exempt from Ma'aser.</p>
<p class="bas indent2"><span class="nm">1.</span><span class="cl">R. Elazar:</span> R. Yochanan appeared to me in a dream. Surely I will give a good answer for him!</p>
<p class="bas indent1"><span class="nm">(p)</span><span class="cl">Answer (R. Elazar):</span> It says "Ta'aseh". (Only) at the time of action, a sale exempts from Ma'aser.</p>
<p class="bas indent1"><span class="nm">(q)</span><span class="cl">Question (R. Shimon ben Elyakim - Beraisa):</span> The exemption of a bought animal is Chal (takes effect) on Mechusar Zeman (before the animal can be offered, i.e. before eight days).</p>
<p class="bas indent1"><span class="nm">(r)</span><span class="cl">Answer #1 (R. Elazar):</span> Your Beraisa is mistaken.</p>
<p class="bas indent1"><span class="nm">(s)</span><span class="cl">Answer #2 (R. Elazar):</span> Even if your Beraisa is correct, it is like R. Shimon ben Yehudah, who says that Mechusar Zeman enters the pen for Ma'aser. It is like a Bechor;</p>
<p class="bas indent2"><span class="nm">1.</span>Just like a Bechor is Kodesh (from birth), but it cannot be offered until later (eight days), also Mechusar Zeman can become Kodesh before it may be offered.</p>
<p class="bas subject"><span class="nm">2)</span>AN <i>ESNAN</i> THAT CAN BE TITHED</p>
<p class="bas indent1"><span class="nm">(a)</span><span class="cl">(A reciter of Beraisos) Question:</span> What is the case of an Esnan (wages of a harlot; it is Pasul for a Korban) that enters the pen for Ma'aser?</p>
<p class="bas indent1"><span class="nm">(b)</span><span class="cl">Answer:</span> The case is, the man gave an animal to a harlot and bought it back. (If it becomes Ma'aser, it is not offered. It is eaten after it gets a Mum.)</p>
<p class="bas indent1"><span class="nm">(c)</span><span class="cl">Objection (Rav):</span> It should be exempt from Ma'aser, because it was sold!</p>
<p class="bas indent1"><span class="nm">(d)</span><span class="cl">Answer:</span> Rav was unaware of R. Asi's teaching, that if one bought 10 fetuses, all enter the pen for Ma'aser. (The case is, he gave ownership of a fetus to her, and bought it back.)</p>
<p class="bas bbbline">56b----------------------------------------56b</p>
<p class="bas indent1"><span class="nm">(e)</span><span class="cl">Question:</span> Why does the Tana discuss when he bought it back? He should teach that it enters the pen when the harlot takes Ma'aser!</p>
<p class="bas indent1"><span class="nm">(f)</span><span class="cl">Answer:</span> The case is, she is a Nochris.</p>
<p class="bas indent1"><span class="nm">(g)</span><span class="cl">Question:</span> The Tana should discuss a Yisraelis, and teach that it enters the pen when she takes Ma'aser!</p>
<p class="bas indent1"><span class="nm">(h)</span><span class="cl">Answer:</span> The Tana teaches that the Esnan of a Yisraelis is not considered an Esnan. (It is Kosher for a Korban);</p>
<p class="bas indent2"><span class="nm">1.</span><span class="cl">(Abaye):</span> The Esnan of a Nochris harlot is Pasul (for a Korban). If a Kohen has relations with her he is not lashed for "Lo Yechalel Zar'o."</p>
<p class="bas indent2"><span class="nm">2.</span>The Esnan of a Yisraelis Zonah is Kosher. If a Kohen has relations with her he is lashed for "Lo Yechalel Zar'o".</p>
<p class="bas indent2"><span class="nm">3.</span>The Esnan of a Nochris harlot is Pasul. We learn from a Gezeirah Shavah, "To'evah-To'evah" from Arayos;</p>
<p class="bas indent3"><span class="nm">i.</span>Kidushin does not take effect with Arayos. Similarly, Esnan applies to a harlot with whom Kidushin does not take effect.</p>
<p class="bas indent3"><span class="nm">ii.</span>If a Kohen has relations with a Nochris he is not lashed for "Lo Yechalel Zar'o" because the child (that could result) would be a Nochri. The child is not called Zar'o (his seed).</p>
<p class="bas subject"><span class="nm">3)</span>WHEN BROTHERS MUST SEPARATE <i>MA'ASAR BEHEMAH</i></p>
<p class="bas indent1"><span class="nm">(a)</span><span class="cl">(Mishnah):</span> Brothers or partners (our text, Rambam; Rashi - brothers who are partners in an inheritance):</p>
<p class="bas indent2"><span class="nm">1.</span>If they are obligated to give a (second) Kalbon (a small coin added when giving Machtzis ha'Shekel), they are exempt from Ma'aser Behemah. (Our text in Rashi, and Tosfos 50b - they must always give at least one Kalbon. Sometimes they must give two. Shitah Mekubetzes here and Rashi in Chulin - sometimes they give one Kalbon, and sometimes they are exempt. Rambam - only the animals brought into the partnership are exempt from Ma'aser. It is as if they were sold.)</p>
<p class="bas indent2"><span class="nm">2.</span>If they are obligated to take Ma'aser, they are exempt from Kalbon.</p>
<p class="bas indent1"><span class="nm">(b)</span>If Kanu (they inherited) animals from Tefisas ha'Bayis (the estate was not yet divided), they are obligated to take Ma'aser. If not, they are exempt. (Here, "Kanu" cannot mean bought, for bought animals are always exempt.)</p>
<p class="bas indent1"><span class="nm">(c)</span>If they divided the estate and became partners again, they are obligated in Kalbon, and they are exempt from Ma'aser.</p>
<p class="bas indent1"><span class="nm">(d)</span><span class="cl">(Gemara - Beraisa):</span> "Yihyeh Lecha" (singular) excludes partners (from Ma'aser Behemah);</p>
<p class="bas indent2"><span class="nm">1.</span><span class="cl">Suggestion:</span> Perhaps they are exempt even if they bought from Tefisas ha'Bayis!</p>
<p class="bas indent2"><span class="nm">2.</span><span class="cl">Rejection:</span> "Yihyeh" (includes this).</p>
<p class="bas indent1"><span class="nm">(e)</span><span class="cl">Question:</span> This verse (Shemos 13:12) refers to Bechor!</p>
<p class="bas indent1"><span class="nm">(f)</span><span class="cl">Answer:</span> We do not need it to teach about Bechor, for "u'Vchoros Bekarchem v'Tzonchem" (plural) teaches that Bechor applies to partners. Therefore, we use it to teach about Ma'aser.</p>
<p class="bas indent1"><span class="nm">(g)</span><span class="cl">(R. Yirmeyah):</span> Sometimes brothers are obligated in both (Kalbon and Ma'aser), and sometimes they are exempt from both. Sometimes they are obligated in Kalbon and exempt from Ma'aser, and sometimes they are obligated in Ma'aser and exempt from Kalbon.</p>
<p class="bas indent2"><span class="nm">1.</span>They are obligated in both if they divided the money, but not the animals;</p>
<p class="bas indent2"><span class="nm">2.</span>They are exempt from both if they divided the animals, but not the money;</p>
<p class="bas indent2"><span class="nm">3.</span>They are obligated in Kalbon and exempt from Ma'aser if they divided everything;</p>
<p class="bas indent2"><span class="nm">4.</span>They are obligated in Ma'aser and exempt from Kalbon if they did not divide anything.</p>
<p class="bas indent1"><span class="nm">(h)</span><span class="cl">Objection:</span> This is obvious!</p>
<p class="bas indent1"><span class="nm">(i)</span><span class="cl">Answer:</span> The Chidush is case 2, in which they divided the animals, but not the money;</p>
<p class="bas indent2"><span class="nm">1.</span>One might have thought that their actions show that they will divide the money soon, they should be obligated in Kalbon (as if they already divided it). R. Yirmeyah teaches that this is not so.</p>
<p class="bas indent1"><span class="nm">(j)</span><span class="cl">(Rav Anan):</span> The Mishnah exempts them from Ma'aser only if one brother took kids and the other took (mature) goats (even if they are worth the same);</p>
<p class="bas indent2"><span class="nm">1.</span>If each took half of the kids, and each took half of the goats, we say that (Yesh Bereirah, and) each brother received his proper inheritance, so they are obligated.</p>
<p class="bas indent1"><span class="nm">(k)</span><span class="cl">(Rav Nachman):</span> Even if each took half the kids and half the goats, (Ein Bereirah, and) we do not say that each received his proper inheritance. Rather, it is as if each bought the animals he took in exchange for his true inheritance. (Bought animals are exempt from Ma'aser.)</p>
<p class="bas indent1"><span class="nm">(l)</span><span class="cl">(R. Elazar):</span> The Mishnah exempts from Ma'aser only if one brother took nine animals and the other took 10 (worth the same amount);</p>
<p class="bas indent2"><span class="nm">1.</span>If each took the same number, we say that (Yesh Bereirah, and) each brother received his proper inheritance, so they are obligated.</p>
<p class="bas indent1"><span class="nm">(m)</span><span class="cl">(R. Yochanan):</span> Even if each took the same number, (Ein Breirah, and) we do not say that each received his proper inheritance. (They are exempt).</p>
