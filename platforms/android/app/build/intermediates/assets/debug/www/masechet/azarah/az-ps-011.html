<p class="bas subject"><span class="nm">1)</span>ONKELUS</p>
<p class="bas indent1"><span class="nm">(a)</span>Onkelus bar Kelonimus converted. The Kaiser sent troops to return him. He expounded verses and persuaded them to convert.</p>
<p class="bas indent2"><span class="nm">1.</span>Kaiser sent more troops; he instructed them not to talk to Onkelus. As they were taking him, he said 'I will just say one thing. A deputy holds a lamp for an official, an official holds for a mayor, a mayor for a governor, and a governor for a king. Does the king hold for anyone?</p>
<p class="bas indent2"><span class="nm">2.</span><span class="cl">The troops:</span> No.</p>
<p class="bas indent2"><span class="nm">3.</span><span class="cl">Onkelus:</span> Hash-m held a lamp for Yisrael - "va'Shem Holech... b'Amud Esh Leha'ir Lahem."</p>
<p class="bas indent2"><span class="nm">4.</span>The troops all converted.</p>
<p class="bas indent2"><span class="nm">5.</span>Kaiser sent more troops. He instructed them not to talk to Onkelus at all. While they were taking him, he saw a Mezuzah; he put his hand on it and asked them what it is.</p>
<p class="bas indent2"><span class="nm">6.</span><span class="cl">The troops:</span> You tell us.</p>
<p class="bas indent2"><span class="nm">7.</span><span class="cl">Onkelus:</span> A mortal king sits inside, and his servants guard him from outside. Hash-m's servants are inside, and He guards them from the outside - "Hash-m Yishmor Tzeisecha u'Vo'echa."</p>
<p class="bas indent2"><span class="nm">8.</span>The troops converted. Kaiser did not send more troops.</p>
<p class="bas indent1"><span class="nm">(b)</span><span class="cl">(Rav Yehudah):</span> "Shnei Goyim b'Vitnech" is written "Geiyim" (exalted ones). This alludes to Antoninus and Rebbi (who descend from Esav and Yakov). Lettuce, gourds and radishes were always on their tables, in all seasons.</p>
<p class="bas indent2"><span class="nm">1.</span>Radishes cut the food (in the stomach, to aid digestion), lettuce turns the food over, and gourds expand the intestines (to help one eat more).</p>
<p class="bas indent1"><span class="nm">(c)</span><span class="cl">Question:</span> Tana d'Vei R. Yishmael taught that "Kishu'in" (gourds) are Kashe (harsh) to the body like a sword!</p>
<p class="bas indent1"><span class="nm">(d)</span><span class="cl">Answer:</span> Small gourds are helpful. Large gourds are harmful.</p>
<p class="bas subject"><span class="nm">2)</span>BURNING THE KING'S KELIM</p>
<p class="bas indent1"><span class="nm">(a)</span><span class="cl">(Mishnah - R. Meir):</span> The day he (the king) was born, the day he (the king's father) died... (Chachamim forbid the day of death only if they burned his Kelim.)</p>
<p class="bas indent1"><span class="nm">(b)</span><span class="cl">Inference:</span> R. Meir does not distinguish whether or not they burned (his Kelim when he died). He always forbids the day. He holds that burning is not a Nochri statute, and Chachamim hold that it is a Nochri statute!</p>
<p class="bas indent1"><span class="nm">(c)</span><span class="cl">Question (Beraisa):</span> We burn after a king dies. This is not forbidden due to 'ways of the Emori (Nochrim)';</p>
<p class="bas indent2"><span class="nm">1.</span>If it were a Nochri statute, this should be forbidden - "uv'Chukoseihem Lo Selechu"! (Presumably, this Beraisa is like the majority opinion, i.e. Chachamim - Ritva.)</p>
<p class="bas indent1"><span class="nm">(d)</span><span class="cl">Answer:</span> Rather, all agree that it is not a Nochri statute. Rather, it shows honor to the king;</p>
<p class="bas indent2"><span class="nm">1.</span>R. Meir holds that they serve idolatry whether or not they burned. Chachamim hold that they serve idolatry only if they burned, for then the death is meaningful to them.</p>
<p class="bas indent1"><span class="nm">(e)</span><span class="cl">(Beraisa):</span> We burn after a king dies. This is not forbidden due to 'ways of the Emori' - "uv'Misrefos Avosecha ha'Melachim...";</p>
<p class="bas indent2"><span class="nm">1.</span>Just like we burn for a king, also for a Nasi.</p>
<p class="bas indent2"><span class="nm">2.</span>We burn his bed and the Kelim he used.</p>
<p class="bas indent2"><span class="nm">3.</span>When Raban Gamliel died, Onkelus burned 70 Manos of (silver coins of) Tzur.</p>
<p class="bas indent2"><span class="nm">4.</span><span class="cl">Question:</span> We said that we burn (only) his bed and the Kelim he used!</p>
<p class="bas indent2"><span class="nm">5.</span><span class="cl">Correction:</span> Rather, he burned Kelim <i>worth</i> 70 Manos.</p>
<p class="bas indent1"><span class="nm">(f)</span><span class="cl">Question:</span> Is it really true that we do not destroy anything else?!</p>
<p class="bas indent2"><span class="nm">1.</span><span class="cl">(Beraisa):</span> We are Oker (cut animals' legs) when the king dies. This is not forbidden due to 'ways of the Emori.'</p>
<p class="bas indent1"><span class="nm">(g)</span><span class="cl">Answer (Rav Papa):</span> That refers to the horse he rode on (it is like a Keli he used).</p>
<p class="bas indent1"><span class="nm">(h)</span><span class="cl">Question:</span> We do this also for Tahor animals (which people do not ride on)!</p>
<p class="bas indent2"><span class="nm">1.</span><span class="cl">(Beraisa):</span> Ikur that makes an animal Treifah is forbidden. If it does not make it Treifah, it is permitted (Rashi; Tosfos - when Ikur makes the animal a Tereifah, one may not eat it means that but one may benefit from it. When it does not make the animal a Tereifah, one may even eat it. This refers to Kosher animals, for Treifah applies only to Kosher animals.)</p>
<p class="bas indent2"><span class="nm">2.</span>Ikur does not make an animal Treifah if it is done below the knee.</p>

<p class="bas subject"><span class="nm">3)</span>OTHER FESTIVALS</p>
<p class="bas indent1"><span class="nm">(a)</span><span class="cl">(Mishnah):</span> The day he shaves his beard...</p>
<p class="bas indent1"><span class="nm">(b)</span><span class="cl">Question:</span> Does the Mishnah mean the day that he shaves his beard and (Rashi - the day he) cuts his hair but leaves his Beloris, or the day that he shaves his beard and (Rashi - the day he) cuts his Beloris?</p>
<p class="bas indent1"><span class="nm">(c)</span><span class="cl">Answer:</span> Both are forbidden.</p>
<p class="bas indent2"><span class="nm">1.</span><span class="cl">(Beraisa #1):</span> The day he shaves his beard and the day he leaves his Beloris (are forbidden).</p>
<p class="bas indent2"><span class="nm">2.</span><span class="cl">(Beraisa #2):</span> The day he shaves his beard and the day he cuts his Beloris. (Rashi explains like this. Tosfos says that this is one Beraisa,which forbids the day he shaves his beard and leaves his Beloris, and the day he shaves his beard and cuts his Beloris.)</p>
<p class="bas indent1"><span class="nm">(d)</span><span class="cl">(Rav Yehudah):</span> Romi has another festival: once in 70 years, they put a healthy man (to represent Esav) on top of a lame man (Yakov); 'Esav' wears the clothes of Adam ha'Rishon, has the skin of R. Yishmael over his face, and the weight of a Zuz of Paz (a very rare type of gold) hanging from his neck;</p>
<p class="bas indent2"><span class="nm">1.</span>They cover the market with carbuncle, and announce in front of him: the prediction (of the redemption of Yisrael) of the master (Rashi - Yakov; Tosfos - Yitzchak) is false; the brother (Yakov) of our master (is) a swindler; one who missed seeing this will not see it (he is not likely to live another 70 years); the swindler did not gain by his swindle (taking the blessings); woe to this one (Esav), when this one (Yakov) will rise.</p>
<p class="bas indent2"><span class="nm">2.</span><span class="cl">(Rav Ashi):</span> They inadvertently said the truth!</p>
<p class="bas indent3"><span class="nm">i.</span>They meant to say 'a swindler is the brother of our master; the way they said implies, the brother of our master, the swindler.</p>
<p class="bas indent1"><span class="nm">(e)</span><span class="cl">Question:</span> Why did the Mishnah omit this festival?</p>
<p class="bas indent1"><span class="nm">(f)</span><span class="cl">Answer:</span> It lists only festivals that occur every year.</p>
<p class="bas indent1"><span class="nm">(g)</span><span class="cl">Question:</span> These are the festivals of Romi. What are the festivals of Peras?</p>
<p class="bas indent1"><span class="nm">(h)</span><span class="cl">Answer:</span> They are Mutradi, Turski, Muharanki, and Moharin.</p>
<p class="bas indent2"><span class="nm">1.</span>The festivals of Bavel are Muharanki, Aknisei, Bechanuni, and the 10th of Adar.</p>
<p class="bas indent1"><span class="nm">(i)</span><span class="cl">(R. Chanan bar Rav Chisda):</span> There are five fixed idolatry houses: Beis Bel in Bavel, Beis Nevo in Kursi, Tarasa in Mefeg, Tzerifa in Ashkelon, and Nashra in Arabia.</p>
<p class="bas indent1"><span class="nm">(j)</span><span class="cl">(Rav Dimi):</span> Also Yarid in Ein Bechi and Nidvacha (some say Nisrava) in Ako.</p>
<p class="bas indent1"><span class="nm">(k)</span><span class="cl">Question (R. Chanan bar Rav Chisda):</span> What is the significance of saying that they are fixed?</p>
<p class="bas indent1"><span class="nm">(l)</span><span class="cl">Answer (Rav Chisda):</span> People sacrifice to them every day of the year.</p>
<p class="bas indent1"><span class="nm">(m)</span><span class="cl">(Shmuel):</span> In Chutz la'Aretz, only the day of the festival is forbidden (but not three days before it).</p>
<p class="bas indent1"><span class="nm">(n)</span><span class="cl">Question:</span> Even the day of the festival is permitted!</p>
<p class="bas indent2"><span class="nm">1.</span>On the merchants' festival, Rav Yehudah allowed Rav Berona to sell wine and Rav Gidal to sell wheat.</p>
<p class="bas indent1"><span class="nm">(o)</span><span class="cl">Answer:</span> The merchants' festival is different, for it is not a fixed annual festival.</p>
<p class="bas subject"><span class="nm">4)</span>OUTSIDE A CITY CELEBRATING A FESTIVAL</p>
<p class="bas indent1"><span class="nm">(a)</span><span class="cl">(Mishnah):</span> When a city celebrates a festival, one may do business outside the city;</p>
<p class="bas indent2"><span class="nm">1.</span>When the outskirts celebrate a festival, one may do business with the city.</p>
<p class="bas indent1"><span class="nm">(b)</span>One may travel to the city only if the road also leads to another city (if not, people will suspect that he is going to sacrifice with them).</p>
<p class="bas indent1"><span class="nm">(c)</span><span class="cl">(Gemara) Version #1 - Question:</span> What is considered outside the city?</p>
<p class="bas indent1"><span class="nm">(d)</span><span class="cl">Answer (Reish Lakish):</span> Even the market of Azah is considered outside Azah (even though it is very close).</p>
