<p class="bas subject"><span class="nm">1)</span>HASH-M'S PRAYER AND HIS <i>MIDAH</i> OF WRATH</p>
<p class="bas indent1"><span class="nm">(a)</span><span class="cl">Question (R. Yochanan):</span> What is the source that Hash-m prays?</p>
<p class="bas indent1"><span class="nm">(b)</span><span class="cl">Answer:</span> "Va'Havi'osim El Har Kodshi v'Simachtim b'Veis <i>Tefilasi</i>," i.e. where I (Hash-m) pray.</p>
<p class="bas indent1"><span class="nm">(c)</span>(Obviously, Hash-m has no need "pray"! Some explain that this is a lesson in how to pray, or a request that we merit His mercy.)</p>
<p class="bas indent1"><span class="nm">(d)</span><span class="cl">Question:</span> What is Hash-m's prayer?</p>
<p class="bas indent1"><span class="nm">(e)</span><span class="cl">Answer (Rav Zutra bar Tuvya):</span> "May it be My will that My mercy overpower My anger, and My mercy overcome My [other] attributes, and that I should treat My children with mercy, and go beyond the letter of the law with them [in judgement]."</p>
<p class="bas indent1"><span class="nm">(f)</span><span class="cl">(Beraisa - R. Yishmael ben Elisha (he was Kohen Gadol)):</span> Once I entered the Kodesh ha'Kodashim to burn the Ketores, and I saw Achasri'el (a prophetic vision of Hash-m; some explain, an angel of Hash-m) sitting on an exalted throne. He asked me to bless Him.</p>
<p class="bas indent1"><span class="nm">(g)</span><span class="cl">R. Yishmael:</span> May it be Your will that Your mercy overpower Your anger, and Your mercy overcome Your attributes, and that You should treat Your children with mercy, and go beyond the letter of the law with them.</p>
<p class="bas indent2"><span class="nm">1.</span>He nodded His head to me; this shows that one should not belittle the blessing of a simple person.</p>
<p class="bas indent1"><span class="nm">(h)</span><span class="cl">Question (R. Yochanan citing R. Yosi):</span> What is the source that one should not try to appease a person when he is angry?</p>
<p class="bas indent1"><span class="nm">(i)</span><span class="cl">Answer:</span> "Panai Yelechu va'Hanichosi Lach" -- after My anger passes, I will let you rest.</p>
<p class="bas indent1"><span class="nm">(j)</span><span class="cl">Question:</span> Does Hash-m really get angry?!</p>
<p class="bas indent1"><span class="nm">(k)</span><span class="cl">Answer:</span> Yes!</p>
<p class="bas indent2"><span class="nm">1.</span><span class="cl">(Beraisa):</span> "V'Kel Zo'em b'Chol Yom" -- Hash-m's fury is for a Rega (moment); this is one part in 58,888 parts of an hour (about 1/15th of a second);</p>
<p class="bas indent2"><span class="nm">2.</span>The only creature that knew when this moment comes was Bil'am, about whom it says "v'Yode'a Da'as Elyon."</p>
<p class="bas indent2"><span class="nm">3.</span><span class="cl">Question:</span> He did not even know his donkey's mind (his donkey won the argument), how could he know Hash-m's?!</p>
<p class="bas indent2"><span class="nm">4.</span><span class="cl">Answer:</span> Rather, "v'Yode'a Da'as Elyon" teaches that Bil'am knew the moment of Hash-m's wrath.</p>
<p class="bas indent1"><span class="nm">(l)</span><span class="cl">(R. Elazar):</span> "Ami Zechor Na Mah Yo'atz Balak... Lema'an Da'as Tzidkos Hash-m" -- we should know what Hash-m did for us, He was not angry for a moment the entire time Bil'am was trying to curse us;</p>
<p class="bas indent2"><span class="nm">1.</span>Had He become angry, [Bil'am would have succeeded to curse us and] there would be no remnant of us.</p>
<p class="bas indent1"><span class="nm">(m)</span>This explains, "Mah Ekov Lo Kaboh Kel, u'Mah Ez'om Lo Za'am Hash-m."</p>
<p class="bas subject"><span class="nm">2)</span>HASH-M'S WRATH</p>
<p class="bas indent1"><span class="nm">(a)</span><span class="cl">Question:</span> How long does Hash-m's wrath last?</p>
<p class="bas indent1"><span class="nm">(b)</span><span class="cl">Answer:</span> It is for a Rega.</p>
<p class="bas indent1"><span class="nm">(c)</span><span class="cl">Question:</span> How long is a Rega?</p>
<p class="bas indent1"><span class="nm">(d)</span><span class="cl">Answer:</span> It is the time needed to say "Rega."</p>
<p class="bas indent1"><span class="nm">(e)</span><span class="cl">Question:</span> What is the source that Hash-m's wrath is a Rega?</p>
<p class="bas indent1"><span class="nm">(f)</span><span class="cl">Answer #1:</span> "Ki Rega b'Apo."</p>
<p class="bas indent1"><span class="nm">(g)</span><span class="cl">Answer #2:</span> "Chavi Chim'at Rega Ad Ya'avor Za'am."</p>
<p class="bas indent1"><span class="nm">(h)</span><span class="cl">Question:</span> When does this Rega come?</p>
<p class="bas indent1"><span class="nm">(i)</span><span class="cl">Answer (Abaye):</span> In the first three hours of the day, when a rooster's mane turns white.</p>
<p class="bas indent1"><span class="nm">(j)</span><span class="cl">Question:</span> Its mane is always white!</p>
<p class="bas indent1"><span class="nm">(k)</span><span class="cl">Answer:</span> At all other times, it has red speckles; during the Rega, it is totally white.</p>
<p class="bas indent1"><span class="nm">(l)</span>A certain heretic used to bother R. Yehoshua ben Levi with [perverted explanations of] verses. R. Yehoshua ben Levi set a rooster between the legs of his bed, intending to curse him when the mane turned all white.</p>
<p class="bas indent2"><span class="nm">1.</span>At the time, R. Yehoshua ben Levi fell asleep; he realized that Hash-m did not want him to curse him -- it says, "v'Rachamav Al Kol Ma'asav," and "Gam Anosh la'Tzadik Lo Tov."</p>
<p class="bas indent1"><span class="nm">(m)</span><span class="cl">(Beraisa - R. Meir):</span> When kings put on their crowns and bow to the sun, immediately Hash-m gets angry.</p>
<p class="bas indent1"><span class="nm">(n)</span><span class="cl">(R. Yochanan):</span> One chastisement in the heart of man is better than many lashes -- "v'Ridfah Es Me'ahaveha... v'Ashuvah El Ishi ha'Rishon Ki Tov Li Az me'Atah."</p>
<p class="bas indent1"><span class="nm">(o)</span><span class="cl">(Reish Lakish):</span> It is better than 100 lashes -- "Tachas Ge'arah v'Mevin me'Hakos Kesil Me'ah."</p>
<p class="bas subject"><span class="nm">3)</span>THINGS HASH-M GRANTED TO MOSHE</p>
<p class="bas indent1"><span class="nm">(a)</span><span class="cl">(R. Yochanan):</span> Moshe requested three things from Hash-m, and Hash-m agreed:</p>
<p class="bas indent2"><span class="nm">1.</span>He asked that the Shechinah dwell among Yisrael -- "Ha'Lo b'Lechtecha Imanu";</p>
<p class="bas indent2"><span class="nm">2.</span>He asked that the Shechinah not dwell amidst Nochrim -- "v'Niflinu Ani v'Amcha";</p>
<p class="bas indent2"><span class="nm">3.</span>He asked that Hash-m show His ways to him -- "Hodi'eni Na Es Derachecha."</p>
<p class="bas indent3"><span class="nm">i.</span>He wanted to know why some Tzadikim prosper and others suffer, and why some Resha'im prosper and others suffer;</p>
<p class="bas indent3"><span class="nm">ii.</span><span class="cl">Hash-m:</span> A Tzadik ben Tzadik (his father was also a Tzadik) prospers, a Tzadik ben Rasha suffers; a Rasha ben Tzadik prospers, a Rasha ben Rasha suffers.</p>
<p class="bas indent1"><span class="nm">(b)</span><span class="cl">Objection:</span> How can he say that a Tzadik ben Tzadik prospers, but a Tzadik ben Rasha suffers?</p>
<p class="bas indent2"><span class="nm">1.</span><span class="cl">Contradiction:</span> It says, "Poked Avon Avos Al Banim," and it says, "u'Vanim Lo Yumsu Al Avos"!</p>
<p class="bas indent2"><span class="nm">2.</span><span class="cl">Resolution:</span> Hash-m punishes someone for his father's sins only if he continues in his father's evil way. (But R. Yochanan says that even a Tzadik ben Rasha suffers!)</p>
<p class="bas indent1"><span class="nm">(c)</span><span class="cl">Correction:</span> Rather, Hash-m said that a pure Tzadik prospers, a Tzadik with some sins suffers; a Rasha with some merits prospers, an absolute Rasha suffers.</p>
<p class="bas indent1"><span class="nm">(d)</span>R. Yochanan argues with R. Meir:</p>
<p class="bas indent2"><span class="nm">1.</span><span class="cl">(R. Meir):</span> Hash-m granted two of Moshe's three requests -- "v'Chanosi Es Asher Achon v'Richamti Es Asher Arachem" -- even if they are unworthy. (He did not explain to Moshe <i>why</i> some Tzadikim suffer....)</p>
<p class="bas indent1"><span class="nm">(e)</span><span class="cl">(Beraisa - R. Yehoshua ben Korchah):</span> "Lo Suchal Lir'os Es Panai" -- when I wanted you to look [at the burning bush on Sinai], you did not want to; now, you want to look [at My glory], I do not want you to.</p>
<p class="bas indent1"><span class="nm">(f)</span>This is unlike R. Shmuel bar Nachmani:</p>
<p class="bas indent2"><span class="nm">1.</span><span class="cl">(R. Shmuel bar Nachmani):</span> Moshe merited three things in reward for his three-fold reluctance to look at the Sneh (burning bush):</p>
<p class="bas indent3"><span class="nm">i.</span>In reward for "va'Yaster Moshe Panav," he merited that his face radiate light;</p>
<p class="bas indent3"><span class="nm">ii.</span>In reward for "Ki Yarei," he merited that Bnei Yisrael were afraid to approach him;</p>
<p class="bas indent3"><span class="nm">iii.</span>In reward for "me'Habit," he merited "u'Semunas Hash-m Yabit."</p>
<p class="bas indent1"><span class="nm">(g)</span><span class="cl">(Rav Chana bar Bizna):</span> "Va'Hasirosi Es Kapi v'Ra'isa Es Achorai" -- Hash-m showed to Moshe the knot of His Tefilin (which is on the back of the neck.)</p>
<p class="bas indent1"><span class="nm">(h)</span><span class="cl">(R. Yochanan):</span> Whenever Hash-m promised to do something good, even if it was conditional, He never retracted -- we learn this from Moshe;</p>
<p class="bas indent2"><span class="nm">1.</span>Hash-m said, "Heref Mimeni v'Ashmidem v'E'eseh Oscha l'Goy Atzum";</p>
<p class="bas indent2"><span class="nm">2.</span>Even though He accepted Moshe's prayer and did not destroy Yisrael, nevertheless he made a great nation from Moshe's children -- "Benei Moshe... Ravu l'Ma'alah."</p>
<p class="bas indent2"><span class="nm">3.</span><span class="cl">(Rav Yosef - Beraisa):</span> It says "Ravu," like it says regarding Bnei Yisrael in Mitzrayim, to teach that he had 600,000 descendants.</p>

<p class="bas subject"><span class="nm">4)</span>THE SIGNIFICANCE OF NAMES</p>
<p class="bas indent1"><span class="nm">(a)</span><span class="cl">(R. Yochanan):</span> Avraham was the first person to call Hash-m "Adon" -- "va'Yomer Ado-nai ba'Mah Eda."</p>
<p class="bas indent1"><span class="nm">(b)</span><span class="cl">(Rav):</span> Daniel was saved (in the lions' den) only in the merit of Avraham -- "Shema Elokeinu El Tefilas Avdecha... Lema'an Ado-nai";</p>
<p class="bas indent2"><span class="nm">1.</span><span class="cl">Question:</span> It should say "Lema'ancha"!</p>
<p class="bas indent2"><span class="nm">2.</span><span class="cl">Answer:</span> He asked to be saved in the merit of Avraham, who called Hash-m "Adon."</p>
<p class="bas indent1"><span class="nm">(c)</span><span class="cl">(R. Yochanan citing R. Shimon):</span> What is the source that one should not try to appease a person when he is angry?</p>
<p class="bas indent1"><span class="nm">(d)</span><span class="cl">Answer:</span> "Panai Yelechu va'Hanichosi Lach" -- after My anger passes, I will let you rest.</p>
<p class="bas indent1"><span class="nm">(e)</span><span class="cl">(R. Yochanan):</span> Leah was the first person to thank Hash-m (when she had her fourth son) -- "Ha'Pa'am Odeh Es Hash-m." (She was the first to feel that she received more than her portion. Normally, there is no limit to the good Hash-m can bestow; however, she knew that there would be only twelve Shevatim from four wives, an average of three each.)</p>
<p class="bas indent1"><span class="nm">(f)</span><span class="cl">(R. Elazar):</span> She called her first son "Reuven" (with Ru'ach ha'Kodesh) -- <i>Re'u</i> (see) the difference between my <i>Ben</i> (son) and Esav;</p>
<p class="bas indent2"><span class="nm">1.</span>Even though Esav willingly sold his birthright, he hated Yakov for taking it;</p>
<p class="bas indent2"><span class="nm">2.</span>Reuven will lose his birthright to Yosef against his will, yet he will not be jealous (and will even try to save Yosef) -- "va'Yishma Reuven va'Yatzilehu mi'Yadam."</p>
<p class="bas indent1"><span class="nm">(g)</span><span class="cl">Question:</span> What is the significance of the name "Ruth"?</p>
<p class="bas indent1"><span class="nm">(h)</span><span class="cl">Answer (R. Yochanan):</span> She merited that David descended from her, who RiVah (satiated) Hash-m with songs and praises (Tehilim.)</p>
<p class="bas indent1"><span class="nm">(i)</span><span class="cl">Question:</span> What is the source that names influence things?</p>
<p class="bas indent1"><span class="nm">(j)</span><span class="cl">Answer (R. Elazar):</span> "Asher Sam Shamos (destruction) ba'Aretz" -- we read this "Shemos."</p>
<p class="bas subject"><span class="nm">5)</span>DEALING WITH THE WICKED</p>
<p class="bas indent1"><span class="nm">(a)</span><span class="cl">(R. Yochanan):</span> Evil in a person's house is worse than the war of Gog and Magog:</p>
<p class="bas indent2"><span class="nm">1.</span>Regarding Avshalom, it says "Mah Rabu Tzarai" -- it does not say this about Gog and Magog.</p>
<p class="bas indent1"><span class="nm">(b)</span><span class="cl">Question:</span> "Mizmor l'David b'Varcho Mipnei Avshalom Beno" -- it should say "Kinah (a lamentation) l'David"!</p>
<p class="bas indent1"><span class="nm">(c)</span><span class="cl">Answer (R. Shimon ben Avishalom):</span> This is like a man who had to pay a loan document -- before paying it, he was sad; after paying it, he rejoiced;</p>
<p class="bas indent2"><span class="nm">1.</span>Hash-m had told David, "Hineni Mekim Alecha Ra'ah mi'Beisecha" -- David was worried, perhaps it will be a slave or Mamzer, who would not have mercy on me!</p>
<p class="bas indent2"><span class="nm">2.</span>When he saw that it was his son, he rejoiced -- therefore, it says "Mizmor."</p>
<p class="bas indent1"><span class="nm">(d)</span><span class="cl">(R. Yochanan):</span> It is permitted to confront Resha'im in this world -- "Ozvei Sorah Yehalelu Rasha v'Shomrei Sorah Yisgaru Vam";</p>
<p class="bas indent1"><span class="nm">(e)</span><span class="cl">Support (Beraisa - R. Dostai):</span> It is permitted to confront Resha'im in this world -- "Ozvei Sorah...";</p>
<p class="bas indent2"><span class="nm">1.</span><span class="cl">Question:</span> But it says, "Al Tischar ba'Mere'im Al Tekanei b'Osei Avlah" (do not challenge them)!</p>
<p class="bas indent2"><span class="nm">2.</span><span class="cl">Answer:</span> It means, do not compete with or be envious of their deeds -- "Al Yekanei Libcha ba'Chata'im Ki Im b'Yir'as Hash-m Kol ha'Yom."</p>
<p class="bas indent1"><span class="nm">(f)</span><span class="cl">Question:</span> R. Yitzchak taught, if you see a Rasha prosper, do not confront him -- "Yachilu Derachav b'Chol Es"!</p>
<p class="bas indent1"><span class="nm">(g)</span><span class="cl">Answer #1:</span> Do not confront him in his affairs, but confront him in Heavenly matters.</p>
<p class="bas indent1"><span class="nm">(h)</span><span class="cl">Answer #2:</span> R. Yitzchak also refers to Heavenly matters -- R. Yochanan agrees that one should not confront him when he prospers.</p>
<p class="bas indent1"><span class="nm">(i)</span><span class="cl">Answer #3:</span> Both discuss confronting a prospering Rasha in Heavenly matters;</p>
<p class="bas indent2"><span class="nm">1.</span>A total Tzadik may confront a Rasha, a Tzadik with some sins should not.</p>
<p class="bas indent2"><span class="nm">2.</span><span class="cl">(Rav Huna) Question:</span> "B'Vala Rasha Tzadik Mimenu" -- can a Rasha swallow (destroy) a Tzadik?! It says, "Hash-m Lo Ya'azvenu v'Yado"!</p>
<p class="bas indent2"><span class="nm">3.</span><span class="cl">Answer #1:</span> He can destroy someone more righteous than himself, he cannot destroy a perfect Tzadik.</p>
<p class="bas indent2"><span class="nm">4.</span><span class="cl">Answer #2:</span> A prospering Rasha can destroy a Tzadik.</p>
<p class="bas indent1"><span class="nm">(j)</span><span class="cl">(R. Yochanan):</span> If one fixes a place for Tefilah (Rif - Torah), his enemies will fall under him -- "v'Samti Makom l'Yisrael Avdi u'Netativ v'Shochen Tachtav v'Lo Yosifu Benei Avlah v'Lo Yirgaz Od l'Anoso."</p>
<p class="bas indent1"><span class="nm">(k)</span><span class="cl">Contradiction (Rav Huna):</span> It says [our enemies will not be able] "l'Anoso" (to afflict us) -- elsewhere, it says "l'Valoso" (to consume us)!</p>
<p class="bas indent1"><span class="nm">(l)</span><span class="cl">Resolution:</span> When the Mikdash was first built, it prevented our enemies from afflicting us; after Yisrael sinned, it afforded only protection that they not consume us!</p>
<p class="bas indent1"><span class="nm">(m)</span><span class="cl">(R. Yochanan):</span> Shimush (service of) Chachamim is greater than learning Torah -- "Po Elisha... Asher Yatzak Mayim Al Yedei Eliyahu";</p>
<p class="bas indent2"><span class="nm">1.</span>It does not say that he learned from him, rather, that he poured water on his hands, for this is greater. (Often (but not here), Shimush Chachamim refers to understanding how to resolve difficulties between Mishnayos.)</p>
