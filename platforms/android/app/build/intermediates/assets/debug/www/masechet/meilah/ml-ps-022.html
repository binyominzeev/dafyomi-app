<p class="bas indent1"><span class="nm">(a)</span><span class="cl">Version #3 (Rav Papa) Question (Reish Lakish - Mishnah - R. Meir):</span> If one bought (100 Lugim of) wine from Kusim (and cannot separate the tithes before drinking), he may declare "the two Lugim that I will later separate should be Terumah. Ten Lugim (that I will separate) are Ma'aser Rishon. Nine Lugim are Ma'aser Sheni." He (Rashi - redeems the Ma'aser Sheni and) may drink immediately;</p>
<p class="bas indent2"><span class="nm">1.</span>R. Yehudah, R. Yosi and R. Shimon forbid. (They hold that Ein Bereirah. I.e. one may not stipulate that a future event will determine what takes effect now. In our Seifa, all rely on Bereirah to say that the last coin is Hekdesh! Alternatively, Reish Lakish asks why R. Meir requires saying, "the two Lugim that I will separate... " In our Seifa, no one requires this!)</p>
<p class="bas indent1"><span class="nm">(b)</span><span class="cl">Answer (R. Yochanan):</span> In the Seifa, he actually said "this wallet will not be exempt from Hekdesh."</p>
