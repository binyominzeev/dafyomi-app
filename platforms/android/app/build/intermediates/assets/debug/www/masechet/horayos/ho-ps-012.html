<p class="bas subject"><span class="nm">1)</span>ANOINTING WITH THE OIL</p>
<p class="bas indent1"><span class="nm">(a)</span><span class="cl">Question:</span> How was Yeho'achaz anointed with Shemen ha'Mishchah? It was hidden before he reigned!</p>
<p class="bas indent2"><span class="nm">1.</span><span class="cl">(Beraisa):</span> The following were hidden with the Aron - Shemen ha'Mishchah, the flask of Man, Aharon's staff, and the chest that the Plishtim sent for a gift to Yisrael - "... in the chest by (the Aron's) side";</p>
<p class="bas indent2"><span class="nm">2.</span><span class="cl">Question:</span> Who hid the Aron?</p>
<p class="bas indent2"><span class="nm">3.</span><span class="cl">Answer:</span> Yoshiyahu Melech Yehudah hid it, because it says "Hash-m will take you and your king into exile" (and he did not want the Nochrim to get it);</p>
<p class="bas indent2"><span class="nm">4.</span>He commanded to hide them - "Tenu Es Aron ha'Kodesh (in the Bayis that Shlomo built)." Presumably, the Aron was already in the Beis ha'Mikdash, so we must say that he commanded to hide them. Also, why did he need to say 'that Shlomo built'? Rather, Shlomo knew that the Beis ha'Mikdash will be destroyed, and he built a basement to hide the Aron - Tosfos ha'Rosh.)</p>
<p class="bas indent3"><span class="nm">i.</span><span class="cl">(R. Elazar):</span> We learn Gezeros Shavos "Sham-Sham", "Mishmeres-Mishmeres", and "Doros-Doros" (teaching that also the flask of Man, Shemen ha'Mishchah, and Aharon's staff were also hidden).</p>
<p class="bas indent1"><span class="nm">(b)</span><span class="cl">Answer (Rav Papa):</span> He was anointed with pure Afarsimon oil (not Shemen ha'Mishchah).</p>
<p class="bas indent1"><span class="nm">(c)</span><span class="cl">(Beraisa):</span> We anoint kings like a crown, and Kohanim like Chai.</p>
<p class="bas indent1"><span class="nm">(d)</span><span class="cl">Question:</span> What does it mean 'like Chai'?</p>
<p class="bas indent1"><span class="nm">(e)</span><span class="cl">Answer (Ran Manshiya bar Gada):</span> It is like the Greek letter 'Chai' (like an English 'X').</p>
<p class="bas indent1"><span class="nm">(f)</span><span class="cl">Beraisa #1:</span> First they pour oil on his (the Kohen's) head, then they put some (drawing a line) between his eyebrows.</p>
<p class="bas indent1"><span class="nm">(g)</span><span class="cl">(Beraisa #2):</span> First they put between his eyebrows, then they pour oil on his head.</p>
<p class="bas indent1"><span class="nm">(h)</span>The Tana'im argue about whether the anointing is primary, or the pouring</p>
<p class="bas indent2"><span class="nm">1.</span>The opinion (Tana #1) that pouring is primary learns from "and he poured Shemen ha'Mishchah on Aharon's head and anointed him";</p>
<p class="bas indent2"><span class="nm">2.</span>The opinion that anointing is primary learns from the Klei Shares (they were anointed, but Shemen ha'Mishchah was not poured on them,).</p>
<p class="bas indent2"><span class="nm">3.</span><span class="cl">Question:</span> The above verse "he poured... he anointed him" proves that we pour first!</p>
<p class="bas indent2"><span class="nm">4.</span><span class="cl">Answer:</span> No. The verse teaches that the whole purpose of pouring was to anoint him.</p>
<p class="bas indent1"><span class="nm">(i)</span><span class="cl">(Beraisa):</span> "Like the good oil... on <i>the beard, the beard</i> of Aharon" alludes to two drops of oil hanging on his beard.</p>
<p class="bas indent1"><span class="nm">(j)</span><span class="cl">(Rav Papa):</span> When he would talk (Rashi; Tosfos ha'Rosh - trim his beard), these drops would rise to the roots of the hairs;</p>
<p class="bas indent2"><span class="nm">1.</span>Moshe was concerned lest he transgressed Me'ilah (by putting two drops more than needed on Aharon - Rashi Kerisus 5b). A voice from Heaven proclaimed "like the good oil (that descends on Aharon's beard)...; Like the dew of Chermon";</p>
<p class="bas indent3"><span class="nm">i.</span>Just like there is no Me'ilah in the dew of Chermon, also in the Shemen ha'Mishchah in Aharon's beard.</p>
<p class="bas indent2"><span class="nm">2.</span>Aharon was still concerned lest he transgressed Me'ilah. (Perhaps the oil went where it was not needed, and he benefited from it.) A voice from Heaven proclaimed "how good and how pleasant, brothers dwelling together";</p>
<p class="bas indent3"><span class="nm">i.</span>Just like Moshe did not transgress, also Aharon.</p>
<p class="bas subject"><span class="nm">2)</span>RELYING ON SIGNS</p>
<p class="bas indent1"><span class="nm">(a)</span><span class="cl">(Beraisa):</span> We anoint kings only by a spring, for an omen that their kingship should last. David commanded "take him (Shlomo) down to Gichon" (to anoint him).</p>
<p class="bas indent1"><span class="nm">(b)</span><span class="cl">(R. Ami):</span> If one wants to know if he will survive the coming year, he should hang a lamp during the 10 days between Rosh Hashanah and Yom Kipur in a house in which wind does not blow. If all the oil burns, this shows that he will live.</p>
<p class="bas indent1"><span class="nm">(c)</span>If one wants to start a business venture, and wants to know if it will succeed, he should raise a chicken. If it grows fat, he will succeed.</p>
<p class="bas indent1"><span class="nm">(d)</span>If one wants to go on a trip and wants to know if he will return, he should stand in a dark house. If he sees a shadow of his shadow, he will return.</p>
<p class="bas indent1"><span class="nm">(e)</span><span class="cl">Rejection:</span> He should not do this. Perhaps he will not see it, and he will worry, and this will spoil his Mazal (and cause that he not return).</p>
<p class="bas indent1"><span class="nm">(f)</span><span class="cl">(Abaye):</span> Since we learn that omens are significant, one should eat on Rosh Hashanah gourds, fenugreek (Rashi - clover) leeks, beets and dates (these grow quickly or are sweet).</p>
<p class="bas indent1"><span class="nm">(g)</span><span class="cl">Rav Mesharshiya (to his sons):</span> When you go to learn from your Rebbe'im, first learn the text (by heart). When he teaches, look at his mouth - "your eyes will see your teachers."</p>
<p class="bas indent2"><span class="nm">1.</span>You should learn by a river, so your teachings will endure like a river;</p>
<p class="bas indent2"><span class="nm">2.</span>It is better to dwell in a wasteheap in Masa Machsya (a city of Chachamim) than in a palace in Pumbadisa;</p>
<p class="bas indent2"><span class="nm">3.</span>It is better to eat rotting fish of Masa Machsya than Kutach (a dish made with bread and milk) of Rami Kipi.</p>
<p class="bas indent1"><span class="nm">(h)</span>"My horn is exalted in my G-d" - my horn is exalted, but not my flask.</p>
<p class="bas indent2"><span class="nm">1.</span>David and Shlomo were anointed with a horn, and their kingships lasted;</p>
<p class="bas indent2"><span class="nm">2.</span>Sha'ul and Yehu were anointed with a flask, and their kingships did not last.</p>
<p class="bas subject"><span class="nm">3)</span>THE DIFFERENT KOHANIM GEDOLIM</p>
<p class="bas indent1"><span class="nm">(a)</span><span class="cl">(Mishnah):</span> A Kohen anointed with Shemen ha'Mishchah...</p>
<p class="bas indent1"><span class="nm">(b)</span><span class="cl">(Beraisa) Suggestion:</span> Perhaps "Mashi'ach" refers to the king!</p>
<p class="bas indent2"><span class="nm">1.</span><span class="cl">Rejection:</span> "Kohen" teaches that this is not so.</p>
<p class="bas indent2"><span class="nm">2.</span><span class="cl">Suggestion:</span> Perhaps even Merubah Begadim (brings a Par for Hora'ah)!</p>
<p class="bas indent2"><span class="nm">3.</span><span class="cl">Rejection:</span> It says "Mashi'ach."</p>
<p class="bas indent2"><span class="nm">4.</span><span class="cl">Suggestion:</span> Perhaps this includes Mashu'ach Milchamah (the Kohen who speaks to the soldiers)!</p>
<p class="bas indent2"><span class="nm">5.</span><span class="cl">Rejection:</span> "The Mashi'ach" refers to the one who has no Mashu'ach above him.</p>
<p class="bas indent2"><span class="nm">6.</span><span class="cl">Question:</span> How does the verse teach this?</p>
<p class="bas indent2"><span class="nm">7.</span><span class="cl">Answer:</span> This is like Rava taught, that "(Gid ha'Nasheh of) <i>the</i> thigh" refers to the special thigh (the right one);</p>
<p class="bas indent3"><span class="nm">i.</span>Here also, "<i>the</i> Mashi'ach" refers to the most special Mashu'ach.</p>
<p class="bas indent1"><span class="nm">(c)</span><span class="cl">Question:</span> How could we think that it refers to the king? He brings a Sa'ir!</p>
<p class="bas indent1"><span class="nm">(d)</span><span class="cl">Answer:</span> One might have thought that if he sinned b'Shogeg, he brings a Sa'ir, but if he sinned through Hora'ah, he brings a Par;</p>
<p class="bas indent2"><span class="nm">1.</span>The verse teaches that this is not so.</p>
<p class="bas indent1"><span class="nm">(e)</span><span class="cl">(Mishnah):</span> The only difference between a Mashu'ach...</p>
<p class="bas indent1"><span class="nm">(f)</span>The Mishnah is not like R. Meir.</p>
<p class="bas indent2"><span class="nm">1.</span><span class="cl">(Beraisa - R. Meir):</span> A Merubah Begadim brings a Par for Hora'ah;</p>
<p class="bas indent2"><span class="nm">2.</span>Chachamim argued with R. Meir.</p>
<p class="bas indent2"><span class="nm">3.</span><span class="cl">Question:</span> What is R. Meir's reason?</p>
<p class="bas indent2"><span class="nm">4.</span><span class="cl">Answer (Beraisa):</span> Had it said "Mashi'ach", one might have thought that only a Mashu'ach brings a Par. "Ha'Kohen ha'Mashi'ach" includes Merubah Begadim.</p>
<p class="bas indent1"><span class="nm">(g)</span><span class="cl">Question:</span> The Seifa proves that the Mishnah is R. Meir!</p>
<p class="bas bbbline">12b----------------------------------------12b</p>
<p class="bas indent2"><span class="nm">1.</span><span class="cl">(Seifa):</span> The only differences between the serving Kohen Gadol and Kohen she'Avar are that the former pays for the Par of Yom Kipur and Asiris ha'Efah.</p>
<p class="bas indent2"><span class="nm">2.</span>This is like R. Meir!</p>
<p class="bas indent2"><span class="nm">3.</span><span class="cl">(Beraisa - R. Meir):</span> If the Kohen Gadol was temporarily disqualified and another was appointed, the first resumes serving (when he becomes qualified again). All laws of a Kohen Gadol (permanently) apply to the second;</p>
<p class="bas indent2"><span class="nm">4.</span>R. Yosi says, the first one resumes serving. The second cannot serve like a Kohen Gadol, nor like a regular Kohen.</p>
<p class="bas indent2"><span class="nm">5.</span><span class="cl">R. Yosi:</span> A case occurred in which the Kohen Gadol became disqualified. Another was appointed. Chachamim ruled that the first resumes serving, but the second cannot serve, not like a Kohen Gadol nor like a regular Kohen:</p>
<p class="bas indent3"><span class="nm">i.</span>He cannot serve like a Kohen Gadol, for this will cause enmity;</p>
<p class="bas indent3"><span class="nm">ii.</span>He cannot serve like a regular Kohen, for we ascend in Kedushah, and we do not descend.</p>
<p class="bas indent2"><span class="nm">6.</span><span class="cl">Summation of question:</span> Did Chachamim teach the Reisha, and R. Meir taught the Seifa?!</p>
<p class="bas indent1"><span class="nm">(h)</span><span class="cl">Answer #1 (Rav Chisda):</span> Yes!</p>
<p class="bas indent1"><span class="nm">(i)</span><span class="cl">Answer #2 (Rav Yosef):</span> Rebbi taught the Mishnah. Regarding the Reisha, he holds like Chachamim. regarding the second, he holds like R. Meir.</p>
<p class="bas indent1"><span class="nm">(j)</span><span class="cl">Answer #3 (Rava):</span> R. Shimon taught the Mishnah. He agrees with R. Meir about one law, and argues with him about the other. (We know this from the following Beraisa.)</p>
<p class="bas indent2"><span class="nm">1.</span><span class="cl">(Beraisa):</span> The following apply to a Kohen Gadol, but not to a regular Kohen:</p>
<p class="bas indent3"><span class="nm">i.</span>He brings a Par for a Chatas. He pays for the Par of Yom Kipur and Asiris ha'Efah;</p>
<p class="bas indent3"><span class="nm">ii.</span>He does not grow his hair long nor tear his clothes in the usual way when a relative dies. He tears at the bottom, and others tear above.</p>
<p class="bas indent3"><span class="nm">iii.</span>He may not become Tamei to bury a relative;</p>
<p class="bas indent3"><span class="nm">iv.</span>He is commanded to marry a virgin. He is forbidden to marry a widow;</p>
<p class="bas indent3"><span class="nm">v.</span>When he dies, Shogeg murderers leave Arei Miklat;</p>
<p class="bas indent3"><span class="nm">vi.</span>He can serve in the Mikdash during Aninus (on the day that a relative died), but he may not eat Kodshim nor receive a portion of Kodshim when he is an Onen (even though he will be permitted to eat at night);</p>
<p class="bas indent3"><span class="nm">vii.</span>(When he is not an Onen) he has first rights to offer Korbanos, and to receive a share of Kodshim;</p>
<p class="bas indent3"><span class="nm">viii.</span>He wears eight garments when he serves;</p>
<p class="bas indent3"><span class="nm">ix.</span>He may do the Avodah of Yom Kipur;</p>
<p class="bas indent3"><span class="nm">x.</span>He is exempt if he enters the Mikdash or eats Kodshim when he is Tamei.</p>
<p class="bas indent2"><span class="nm">2.</span>All these apply to Merubah Begadim, except for bringing a Par for a Chatas.</p>
<p class="bas indent2"><span class="nm">3.</span>All of these laws apply to Kohen she'Avar, except for paying for the Par of Yom Kipur and Asiris ha'Efah;</p>
<p class="bas indent2"><span class="nm">4.</span>None of these laws apply to Mashu'ach Milchamah, except for the five laws in the Parshah of the Kohen Gadol:</p>
<p class="bas indent3"><span class="nm">i.</span>He does not grow his hair long nor tear his clothes (above) when a relative dies;</p>
<p class="bas indent3"><span class="nm">ii.</span>He may not become Tamei for a relative;</p>
<p class="bas indent3"><span class="nm">iii.</span>He is commanded to marry a virgin, and is forbidden to marry a widow;</p>
<p class="bas indent3"><span class="nm">iv.</span>R. Yehudah says, when he dies, the Shogeg murderers leave the Arei Miklat;</p>
<p class="bas indent3"><span class="nm">v.</span>Chachamim say, they do not leave.</p>
<p class="bas indent1"><span class="nm">(k)</span><span class="cl">Question:</span> What is the source that this Beraisa is like R. Shimon?</p>
<p class="bas indent1"><span class="nm">(l)</span><span class="cl">Answer (Rav Papa):</span> We know that R. Shimon exempts a Kohen Gadol for Tum'ah of the Mikdash and Kodshim.</p>
<p class="bas subject"><span class="nm">4)</span>MASHU'ACH MILCHAMAH</p>
<p class="bas indent1"><span class="nm">(a)</span><span class="cl">(Beraisa):</span> None of these laws apply to Mashu'ach Milchamah, except for the five things in the Parshah of the Kohen Gadol (above, 4:i-v).</p>
<p class="bas indent1"><span class="nm">(b)</span><span class="cl">Question:</span> What is the source of this?</p>
<p class="bas indent1"><span class="nm">(c)</span><span class="cl">(Beraisa):</span> "The Kohen that is greater than his brothers" is the Kohen Gadol;</p>
<p class="bas indent2"><span class="nm">1.</span>"That Shemen ha'Mishchah was poured on his head" is Mashu'ach Milchamah;</p>
<p class="bas indent2"><span class="nm">2.</span>"And he qualified himself (through bringing Asiris ha'Eifah) to wear the clothing" is Merubah Begadim.</p>
<p class="bas indent1"><span class="nm">(d)</span>Regarding all of these it says "he will not grow his hair long, and he will not tear his clothes. He will not approach a Mes."</p>
<p class="bas indent1"><span class="nm">(e)</span><span class="cl">Suggestion:</span> Perhaps any of these Kohanim Gedolim may serve when he is an Onen!</p>
<p class="bas indent1"><span class="nm">(f)</span><span class="cl">Rejection:</span> "(He will not leave the Mikdash, and will not profane)... for the crown of Shemen Mishchas Elokav is <i>on him</i>", but not on another (anointed Kohen, i.e. the Mashu'ach Milchamah. Also, we do not exclude Merubah Begadim, for "he will not leave the Mikdash (when a relative dies)" applies to him.)</p>
<p class="bas indent1"><span class="nm">(g)</span><span class="cl">Suggestion:</span> Since the law of Mashu'ach Milchamah is different regarding Aninus, perhaps he is not commanded to marry (only) a virgin!</p>
<p class="bas indent1"><span class="nm">(h)</span><span class="cl">Rejection:</span> "<i>And</i> he (will marry a virgin" includes Mashu'ach Milchamah).</p>
<p class="bas indent1"><span class="nm">(i)</span>Tana'im argue about this.</p>
<p class="bas indent2"><span class="nm">1.</span><span class="cl">(Beraisa - R. Yishmael):</span> "He will marry a woman in her virginity" - because the law of Mashu'ach Milchamah is different regarding Aninus, the Torah needed to teach that this applies also to him;</p>
<p class="bas indent2"><span class="nm">2.</span>R. Akiva says, if a Kohen Gadol became Tamei, he is still commanded to marry (only) a virgin (because he may serve again after becoming Tahor);</p>
<p class="bas indent3"><span class="nm">i.</span><span class="cl">Suggestion:</span> If he became blemished (and will not serve again), he is not commanded!</p>
<p class="bas indent3"><span class="nm">ii.</span><span class="cl">Rejection:</span> "<i>And</i> he" teaches that this is not so.</p>
<p class="bas indent1"><span class="nm">(j)</span><span class="cl">Question (Rava and Rav Papa):</span> If a Kohen Gadol became a Metzora, may he marry a widow?</p>
<p class="bas indent2"><span class="nm">1.</span>Is he Nidcheh (Rashi - utterly withheld from ever marrying a widow; Tosfos ha'Rosh - exempted from those laws of a Kohen Gadol he cannot fulfill, but still commanded about what he can fulfill)?</p>
<p class="bas indent2"><span class="nm">2.</span>Or, is he Patur (Rashi - unable to marry a widow while he is Kohen Gadol, but now this does not apply; Tosfos ha'Rosh - totally exempted from all laws of a Kohen Gadol)?</p>
<p class="bas indent2"><span class="nm">3.</span>Rav Nachman was unable to answer the question.</p>
<p class="bas indent1"><span class="nm">(k)</span><span class="cl">Answer (Rav Huna brei d'Rav Yehoshua - Beraisa):</span> Not only a Kohen Gadol disqualified due to Tum'ah (is still commanded to marry a virgin), but even one disqualified due to a blemish - "<i>and</i> he." (Tzara'as is the ultimate blemish, and R. Akiva taught that a blemished Kohen Gadol is still commanded.)</p>
<p class="bas indent1"><span class="nm">(l)</span>Rav Papa was so happy with the answer that he kissed Rav Huna and married off his daughter to him.</p>
<p class="bas subject"><span class="nm">5)</span>HOW A KOHEN GADOL TEARS HIS CLOTHES</p>
<p class="bas indent1"><span class="nm">(a)</span><span class="cl">(Mishnah):</span> A Kohen Gadol tears his clothes from below; a commoner tears from above.</p>
<p class="bas indent1"><span class="nm">(b)</span>A Kohen Gadol can serve in the Mikdash when he is an Onen, but he may not eat Kodshim. A regular Kohen may not serve nor eat when he is an Onen.</p>
<p class="bas indent1"><span class="nm">(c)</span><span class="cl">(Gemara - Rav):</span> 'Below' and 'above' are understood literally, at the bottom or top of his garment.</p>
<p class="bas indent1"><span class="nm">(d)</span><span class="cl">(Shmuel):</span> 'Below' and 'above' mean above and below the collar, by the neck.</p>
<p class="bas indent1"><span class="nm">(e)</span><span class="cl">Question (Beraisa):</span> For any (other) relative that dies, one may tear the neckline of his garment or below it. For a parent, he must tear the neckline.</p>
<p class="bas indent2"><span class="nm">1.</span>Since one fulfills the Mitzvah by tearing below the neckline, how can Shmuel permit a Kohen Gadol to do this? It says "he will not tear his clothes"!</p>
<p class="bas indent1"><span class="nm">(f)</span><span class="cl">Answer:</span> Shmuel holds like R. Yehudah, who says that one who does not tear the neckline has not done the Mitzvah.</p>
<p class="bas indent1"><span class="nm">(g)</span><span class="cl">Question:</span> R. Yehudah holds that a Kohen Gadol does not tear at all!</p>
<p class="bas indent2"><span class="nm">1.</span><span class="cl">(Beraisa - R. Yehudah):</span> Had it said "he will not Yifra (expose) a head, and he will not tear a garment", one might have understood that he will not expose the head or tear the garment of a Sotah;</p>
<p class="bas indent3"><span class="nm">i.</span>Rather, it says "he will not Yifra (let grow the hair of) <i>his</i> head, and he will not tear <i>his</i> garments" - he does not let his hair grow nor tear his garments at all;</p>
<p class="bas indent2"><span class="nm">2.</span>R. Yishmael says, he does not tear his garments like others. He tears below, and commoners tear above.</p>
<p class="bas indent1"><span class="nm">(h)</span><span class="cl">Answer:</span> Shmuel holds like R. Yehudah regarding what is considered tearing. He does not rule like him regarding whether a Kohen Gadol tears.</p>
<p class="bas subject"><span class="nm">6)</span>WHAT IS MORE FREQUENT AND MORE KODESH</p>
<p class="bas indent1"><span class="nm">(a)</span><span class="cl">(Mishnah):</span> Whatever is more frequent has precedence. Whatever is more Kadosh has precedence.</p>
<p class="bas indent2"><span class="nm">1.</span>If the Par of the Kohen Gadol and the Par of the Tzibur (for sins through Hora'ah) are waiting to be offered, the Kohen Gadol offers his Par completely before that of the Tzibur.</p>

<p class="bas indent1"><span class="nm">(c)</span><span class="cl">Answer (Abaye):</span> "Aside from the morning Olah <i>l'Olas ha'Tamid</i>" - these words are extra!</p>
<p class="bas indent2"><span class="nm">1.</span>They teach that whatever is Tamid (more frequent) goes first. ("Aside from" connotes that the coming matter is domne first.)</p>
<p class="bas indent1"><span class="nm">(d)</span><span class="cl">(Mishnah):</span> Whatever is more Kadosh than something else, goes first.</p>

<p class="bas indent1"><span class="nm">(f)</span><span class="cl">Answer (Tana d'Vei R. Yishmael):</span> "You will be Mekadesh him (a Kohen)" - in every matter of Kedushah. He reads the Torah first, blesses (after eating) first, and takes a nice portion first.</p>
