<p class="dedicationbox"><br>12TH CYCLE DEDICATION<br>NEDARIM 85 (8 Adar II) - dedicated by Rabbi Wes Kalmar of New Haven, CT, to honor the Yahrzeit of his father, Mattisyahu Yehuda (Martin) Kalmar z'l. </p>

<p class="bas subject"><span class="nm">1)</span>TOVAS HANA'AH</p>
<p class="bas indent1"><span class="nm">(a)</span><span class="cl">Rejection:</span> No, all hold that it is not money.</p>
<p class="bas indent1"><span class="nm">(b)</span><span class="cl">Answer #2:</span> They argue about gifts that have not yet been separated. (R. Yosi b'Rebbi Yehudah holds that it is as if they were separated. Therefore, it is as if the thief stole Chulin from the owner, and tithes that belong to Kohanim and Leviyim. Rebbi holds that it is as if they were not separated).</p>
<p class="bas indent1"><span class="nm">(c)</span><span class="cl">Objection:</span> If Tovas Hana'ah is not money, even if it is as if the gifts were not separated, the thief should pay only for the Chulin!</p>
<p class="bas indent1"><span class="nm">(d)</span><span class="cl">Answer #3:</span> Rebbi fines the thief, and makes him pay more than just the value of the Chulin, to discourage theft. R. Yosi b'Rebbi Yehudah holds that the owner receives only the value of the Chulin. This is a stringency to discourage people from delaying giving tithes.</p>
<p class="bas indent1"><span class="nm">(e)</span><span class="cl">Answer #4 (Rava):</span> (One Tana taught the entire Mishnah. He holds that Tovas Hana'ah is money.) The reason why Kohanim and Leviyim may take against his will (in the Reisha) is because tithes must be given to them;</p>
<p class="bas indent2"><span class="nm">1.</span>Because he forbade Kohanim and Leviyim from benefiting from him, he may not give to them. He forfeits his Tovas Hana'ah, so any Kohen or Levi may take the appropriate tithe.</p>
<p class="bas subject"><span class="nm">2)</span>A VOW ABOUT SOMETHING NOT YET IN THE WORLD</p>
<p class="bas indent1"><span class="nm">(a)</span><span class="cl">(Mishnah):</span> If a woman forbade, to her father, father-in-law, brother or brother-in-law, what she will earn, her husband cannot annul the vow;</p>
<p class="bas indent1"><span class="nm">(b)</span>If she forbade her earnings to her husband, he need not annul (the vow is void anyway);</p>
<p class="bas indent2"><span class="nm">1.</span>R. Akiva says, he should annul it, lest she earn more than required;</p>
<p class="bas indent2"><span class="nm">2.</span>R. Yochanan ben Nuri says, he should annul it, lest he divorce her, and the vow would prevent him from remarrying her.</p>
<p class="bas indent1"><span class="nm">(c)</span><span class="cl">(Gemara - Shmuel):</span> The Halachah follows R. Yochanan ben Nuri.</p>
<p class="bas indent1"><span class="nm">(d)</span><span class="cl">Inference:</span> Shmuel holds that a man can make Hekdesh (which has the same law as forbidding through a vow) something that is not yet in the world.</p>
<p class="bas indent1"><span class="nm">(e)</span><span class="cl">Contradiction (Mishnah):</span> If one was Makdish his wife's earnings, she works and eats (what she produces);</p>
<p class="bas indent2"><span class="nm">1.</span>R. Meir says, any excess (earnings) is Hekdesh;</p>
<p class="bas bbbline">85b----------------------------------------85b</p>
<p class="bas indent2"><span class="nm">2.</span>R. Yochanan ha'Sandlar says, it is Chulin.</p>
<p class="bas indent2"><span class="nm">3.</span><span class="cl">(Shmuel):</span> The Halachah follows R. Yochanan ha'Sandlar.</p>
<p class="bas indent3"><span class="nm">i.</span><span class="cl">Inference:</span> Shmuel holds that one cannot be Makdish something that is not yet in the world.</p>
<p class="bas indent2"><span class="nm">4.</span><span class="cl">Suggestion:</span> Shmuel meant that the Halachah follows R. Yochanan ben Nuri (only) regarding the excess (it is not Hekdesh).</p>
<p class="bas indent2"><span class="nm">5.</span><span class="cl">Rejection:</span> If so, Shmuel should have said that the Halachah follows R. Yochanan ben Nuri regarding extra earnings!</p>
<p class="bas indent3"><span class="nm">i.</span>Alternatively, he should have said that the Halachah does not follow R. Akiva (for Shmuel holds that the vow need not be annulled, for it does not forbid excess earnings nor after divorce)!</p>
<p class="bas indent3"><span class="nm">ii.</span>Or,  he should have said that the Halachah follows the first Tana (who says he need not annul)!</p>
<p class="bas indent1"><span class="nm">(f)</span><span class="cl">Answer #1 (Rav Yosef):</span> One cannot ask a question from Konamos to Hekdesh. Konamos are different!</p>
<p class="bas indent2"><span class="nm">1.</span>Since a person can forbid his friend's property to himself via Konam, he can also forbid something that is not yet in the world.</p>
<p class="bas indent1"><span class="nm">(g)</span><span class="cl">Objection (Abaye):</span> Granted, a person can forbid his friend's property to himself via Konam, since he can forbid his property to his friend;</p>
<p class="bas indent2"><span class="nm">1.</span>Will we say that a person can forbid something not in the world to his friend? A person cannot forbid his friend's property to his friend!</p>
<p class="bas indent1"><span class="nm">(h)</span><span class="cl">Answer #2 (Rav Huna brei d'Rav Yehoshua):</span> The case is, she said 'my hands are Hekdesh to their Maker.' Her hands are in the world.</p>
<p class="bas indent1"><span class="nm">(i)</span><span class="cl">Question:</span> When she says this, they do not become Hekdesh. They are obligated to work for her husband!</p>
<p class="bas indent1"><span class="nm">(j)</span><span class="cl">Answer #1:</span> She said 'when I will be divorced.'</p>
<p class="bas indent1"><span class="nm">(k)</span><span class="cl">Question:</span> Right now, she is not divorced! Do we ever find that something does not become Hekdesh now, and it becomes Hekdesh later?</p>
