<p class="bas subject"><span class="nm">1)</span>CAPITAL CASES ARE FINISHED DURING THE DAY</p>
<p class="bas indent1"><span class="nm">(a)</span><span class="cl">(Mishnah):</span> Monetary cases must be started during the day....[Capital cases are started and finished during the day.]</p>
<p class="bas indent1"><span class="nm">(b)</span><span class="cl">Question:</span> What is the source of this?</p>
<p class="bas indent1"><span class="nm">(c)</span><span class="cl">Answer (Rav Simi bar Chiya):</span> "V'Hoka Osam la'Shem Neged ha'Shemesh."</p>
<p class="bas indent1"><span class="nm">(d)</span><span class="cl">(Rav Chisda):</span> "V'Hoka" means hanging. It says "v'Hokanum la'Shem b'Giv'as Sha'ul", and it says "va'Tikach... ha'Sak va'Tatehu" (the bodies were exposed, because they were hanging).</p>
<p class="bas indent2"><span class="nm">1.</span>Also, it says "Kach Es Kol Roshei ha'Am."</p>
<p class="bas indent2"><span class="nm">2.</span><span class="cl">Question:</span> The people sinned (with the women of Midyan and served Ba'al Pe'or), and not the leaders!</p>
<p class="bas indent2"><span class="nm">3.</span><span class="cl">Answer (Rav Yehudah):</span> Hash-m told Moshe to set up many Batei Din to judge the sinners.</p>
<p class="bas indent2"><span class="nm">4.</span><span class="cl">Question:</span> What is the reason?</p>
<p class="bas indent3"><span class="nm">i.</span><span class="cl">Suggestion:</span> One Beis Din may judge only one capital case at a time.</p>
<p class="bas indent3"><span class="nm">ii.</span><span class="cl">Rejection:</span> It may not judge capital cases of different death penalties (or transgressions), but it may judge many similar cases (i.e. of the same transgression).</p>
<p class="bas indent2"><span class="nm">5.</span><span class="cl">Answer:</span> Involving many people in punishing the sinners would assuage Hash-m's anger at Yisrael.</p>
<p class="bas subject"><span class="nm">2)</span>WHEN MAY WE GIVE THE FINAL VERDICT IN CAPITAL CASES?</p>
<p class="bas indent1"><span class="nm">(a)</span><span class="cl">(Mishnah):</span> Capital cases can be finished on the same day for Zechus (and on the morrow for Chiyuv).</p>
<p class="bas indent1"><span class="nm">(b)</span><span class="cl">Question:</span> What is the source of this?</p>
<p class="bas indent1"><span class="nm">(c)</span><span class="cl">Answer #1 (R. Chanina):</span> "Mele'asi Mishpat Tzedek Yalin Bah v'Atah Meratzechim" (postponing the verdict until the morrow was good. Now they do not. This is like murder!)</p>
<p class="bas indent1"><span class="nm">(d)</span><span class="cl">Answer #2 (Rava):</span> "Ashru Chamutz" - support a judge (some texts - happy is a judge) who delays giving the verdict.</p>
<p class="bas indent2"><span class="nm">1.</span>R. Chanina expounds, "Ashru Chamutz", but not Chometz (vinegar, i.e. do not help the thief to keep his theft).</p>
<p class="bas indent1"><span class="nm">(e)</span><span class="cl">Question:</span> How does Rava expound "Mele'asi Mishpat..."?</p>
<p class="bas indent1"><span class="nm">(f)</span><span class="cl">Answer:</span> He expounds like R. Elazar;</p>
<p class="bas indent2"><span class="nm">1.</span><span class="cl">(R. Elazar):</span> If Tzedakah is not given on the night after a fast (as is usual), rather the next day, it is like bloodshed - "...Tzedek Yalin Bah v'Atah Meratzechim."</p>
<p class="bas indent2"><span class="nm">2.</span>This is only where they normally give bread and dates (for then, the poor expected to receive it, and did not prepare food to break the fast), but where they give money or grain, it is not a problem.</p>
<p class="bas indent1"><span class="nm">(g)</span><span class="cl">(Mishnah):</span> Therefore, we do not begin on Erev Shabbos (or Erev Yom Tov).</p>
<p class="bas indent1"><span class="nm">(h)</span><span class="cl">Question:</span> What is the reason?</p>
<p class="bas indent1"><span class="nm">(i)</span><span class="cl">Answer:</span> (If he is liable,) we would not be able to finish the case properly.</p>
<p class="bas indent2"><span class="nm">1.</span>We cannot plan to finish on Erev Shabbos. If the majority are Mechayev, we need Halanas Din!</p>
<p class="bas indent2"><span class="nm">2.</span>We cannot give the verdict and execute on the next day. Misas Beis Din does not override Shabbos!</p>
<p class="bas indent2"><span class="nm">3.</span>We cannot execute right after Shabbos, for this is not "Neged ha'Shemesh" (during the day).</p>
<p class="bas indent2"><span class="nm">4.</span>We cannot kill him on Sunday, for this delays his execution after the sentence!</p>
<p class="bas indent2"><span class="nm">5.</span>We cannot finish judging on Sunday, lest the judges forget their reasoning!</p>
<p class="bas indent3"><span class="nm">i.</span>Even though we write their words, we cannot write how each understood in his heart. This might be forgotten.</p>
<p class="bas subject"><span class="nm">3)</span>DOES MISAS BEIS DIN OVERRIDE SHABBOS?</p>
<p class="bas indent1"><span class="nm">(a)</span><span class="cl">Question (Reish Lakish):</span> A Kal va'Chomer should teach that burying a Mes Mitzvah overrides Shabbos!</p>
<p class="bas indent2"><span class="nm">1.</span>Avodah (in the Mikdash, e.g. offering Korbanos of the Tzibur) overrides Shabbos, and burying a Mes Mitzvah overrides Avodah (as we now explain);</p>
<p class="bas indent3"><span class="nm">i.</span><span class="cl">(Beraisa) Question:</span> What do we learn from "l'Aviv... ul'Achoso Lo Yitama"?</p>
<p class="bas indent3"><span class="nm">ii.</span><span class="cl">Answer - Suggestion:</span> If someone (Tosfos; Rashi - the Kohen Gadol, who was a Nazir) was going to slaughter his Korban Pesach or circumcise his son, and he heard that a relative died, perhaps he should (engage in the burial and) become Tamei!</p>
<p class="bas bbbline">35b----------------------------------------35b</p>
<p class="bas indent3"><span class="nm">iii.</span><span class="cl">Rejection:</span> "Lo Yitama."</p>
<p class="bas indent3"><span class="nm">iv.</span><span class="cl">Suggestion:</span> Perhaps, just like he does not become Tamei for his sister, he does not become Tamei for a Mes Mitzvah!</p>
<p class="bas indent3"><span class="nm">v.</span><span class="cl">Rejection:</span> "Ul'Achoso" - for his sister he does not become Tamei, but he becomes Tamei for a Mes Mitzvah.</p>
<p class="bas indent2"><span class="nm">2.</span>Since burying a Mes Mitzvah overrides Avodah (he will be unable to offer Korban Pesach), and Avodah overrides Shabbos, and all the more so burying a Mes Mitzvah should override Shabbos!</p>
<p class="bas indent1"><span class="nm">(b)</span><span class="cl">Answer (R. Yochanan):</span> Misas Beis Din disproves this, for it overrides Avodah, but it does not override Shabbos.</p>
<p class="bas indent1"><span class="nm">(c)</span><span class="cl">Question (Reish Lakish):</span> A Kal va'Chomer should teach that Misas Beis Din overrides Shabbos!</p>
<p class="bas indent2"><span class="nm">1.</span>Avodah (in the Mikdash) overrides Shabbos, and Misas Beis Din overrides Avodah - "me'Im Mizbechi Tikachenu Lamus" (if a Kohen who is Chayav Misah wants to do Avodah, we do not allow him. We judge him immediately);</p>
<p class="bas indent2"><span class="nm">2.</span>All the more so, Misas Beis Din should override Shabbos!</p>
<p class="bas indent1"><span class="nm">(d)</span><span class="cl">Answer (Rava):</span> Tana d'Vei R. Yishmael teaches that it does not.</p>
<p class="bas indent1"><span class="nm">(e)</span><span class="cl">(Tana d'Vei R. Yishmael) Question:</span> What do we learn from "Lo Seva'aru Esh b'Chol Moshevoseichem b'Yom ha'Shabbos"?</p>
<p class="bas indent2"><span class="nm">1.</span><span class="cl">Objection:</span> We know what it teaches! R. Yosi holds that it teaches that burning is only a Lav, and R. Noson holds that it separates the Melachos of Shabbos!</p>
<p class="bas indent3"><span class="nm">i.</span><span class="cl">(Beraisa - R. Yosi):</span> The Torah forbids all Melachos. It specifically forbids burning to teach that it is only a Lav, and one is not Chayav Misah for it;</p>
<p class="bas indent3"><span class="nm">ii.</span>R. Noson says, it is taught by itself to separate the Melachos (to teach that one is liable for a single Melachah, and to obligate a Korban for every Melachah done b'Shogeg).</p>
<p class="bas indent2"><span class="nm">2.</span><span class="cl">Correction (Rava):</span> Tana d'Vei R. Yishmael asks why the Torah forbids burning "<i>b'Chol Moshevoseichem</i>" (in all your dwellings, i.e. even in Chutz la'Aretz);</p>
<p class="bas indent3"><span class="nm">i.</span>Shabbos is an obligation on people (it does not depend on land). We know that such Mitzvos apply everywhere!</p>
<p class="bas indent1"><span class="nm">(f)</span><span class="cl">Answer (a Talmid citing R. Yishmael) Suggestion:</span> "...B'Ish Chet Mishpat Maves v'Humas" - perhaps one can be executed on a weekday or Shabbos!</p>
<p class="bas indent2"><span class="nm">1.</span><span class="cl">Question:</span> Surely it is forbidden on Shabbos - "Mechalaleha Mos Yumas" (killing is a Melachah)!</p>
<p class="bas indent2"><span class="nm">2.</span><span class="cl">Answer:</span> Perhaps that applies to Melachos other than Misas Beis Din.</p>
<p class="bas indent2"><span class="nm">3.</span><span class="cl">Suggestion:</span> Perhaps it includes Misas Beis Din, and "v'Humas" applies only on a weekday!</p>
<p class="bas indent3"><span class="nm">i.</span><span class="cl">Suggestion:</span> Or, perhaps "v'Humas" applies even on Shabbos!</p>
<p class="bas indent1"><span class="nm">(g)</span><span class="cl">Conclusion:</span> It says "Lo Seva'aru Esh b'Chol Moshevoseichem", and it says "l'Chukas Mishpat l'Doroseichem b'Chol Moshevoseichem." Just like 'Moshevos' in the latter verse refers to Beis Din, also in the former (i.e. it forbids burning in Beis Din to execute).</p>
<p class="bas subject"><span class="nm">4)</span>DOES MISAS BEIS DIN OVERRIDE AVODAH?</p>
<p class="bas indent1"><span class="nm">(a)</span><span class="cl">Question (Abaye):</span> Since Misas Beis Din does not override Shabbos, a Kal va'Chomer should teach that Misas Beis Din does not override Avodah!</p>
<p class="bas indent2"><span class="nm">1.</span>Avodah overrides Shabbos, but Misas Beis Din does not override Shabbos. All the more so, Misas Beis Din does not override Avodah!</p>
<p class="bas indent2"><span class="nm">2.</span><span class="cl">Question:</span> It says "me'Im Mizbechi Tikachenu Lamus"!</p>
<p class="bas indent2"><span class="nm">3.</span><span class="cl">Answer:</span> That refers to a Korban Yachid, which does not override Shabbos (therefore, Misas Beis Din overrides it, but Misas Beis Din should not override a Korban Tzibur)!</p>
