<p class="bas indent1"><span class="nm">(a)</span><span class="cl">Question (against Rav - Beraisa):</span> If five animals were born (in Reuven's flock) in Kefar Chananyah, and five (32 Mil away) in Kefar Osnai, they do not join unless he has one (in the middle) in Tzipori.</p>
<p class="bas indent1"><span class="nm">(b)</span><span class="cl">Answer (Shmuel, on behalf of Rav):</span> The Seifa does not refer to the Reisha (when there were only five on each side), rather, if there were nine on each side. Then, one in the middle joins with those on either side to make 10.</p>
<p class="bas indent1"><span class="nm">(c)</span><span class="cl">(Rav Papa):</span> According to Shmuel, even if there are no animals in the middle, the shepherd joins them if his residence is in the middle, or his Kelim. (Surely, he will go to retrieve them).</p>
<p class="bas indent1"><span class="nm">(d)</span><span class="cl">Question (Rav Ashi):</span> If the shepherd's dog is in the middle, does this join them?</p>
<p class="bas indent2"><span class="nm">1.</span>Since he can call to the dog, he need not go there, so they do not join;</p>
<p class="bas indent2"><span class="nm">2.</span>Or, since sometimes the dog does not come and he must go there, they do join!</p>
<p class="bas indent1"><span class="nm">(e)</span>This question is not resolved.</p>
<p class="bas subject"><span class="nm">2)</span>THE <i>YARDEN</i> SEPARATES</p>
<p class="bas indent1"><span class="nm">(a)</span><span class="cl">(Mishnah - R. Meir):</span> The Yarden separates regarding Ma'aser Behemah.</p>
<p class="bas indent1"><span class="nm">(b)</span><span class="cl">(R. Ami):</span> This is only if there is no bridge there. If there is a bridge, they join.</p>
<p class="bas indent1"><span class="nm">(c)</span><span class="cl">Inference:</span> It separates because neither the animals nor the shepherd can get to those on the other side.</p>
<p class="bas indent1"><span class="nm">(d)</span><span class="cl">Question (Beraisa):</span> If Reuven had 10 animals (in all) on the two sides of the Yarden (some on each side), or in two provinces (in one kingdom), even if they are close to each other, they do not join. There is no need to say that animals in Eretz Yisrael and Chutz la'Aretz do not join.</p>
<p class="bas indent2"><span class="nm">1.</span>Animals in Eretz Yisrael and Chutz la'Aretz resemble the case of a bridge (they can come to each other), yet they do not join!</p>
<p class="bas indent1"><span class="nm">(e)</span><span class="cl">(R. Chiya bar Aba):</span> Rather, R. Meir learns from "veha'Yarden Yigbol Oso li'F'as Kedmah" that the Yarden is a boundary (for Ma'aser Behemah).</p>
<p class="bas indent1"><span class="nm">(f)</span><span class="cl">Question:</span> If so, every border between Shevatim should be a boundary. It says "v'Sa'ar ha'Gevul" and "v'Alah ha'Gevul"!</p>
<p class="bas indent1"><span class="nm">(g)</span><span class="cl">Answer:</span> The Torah considers all of Eretz Yisrael to be one boundary - "Zos Tihyeh Lachem ha'Aretz li'Gvuloseha Soviv".</p>
<p class="bas indent1"><span class="nm">(h)</span><span class="cl">Question:</span> If so, also the Yarden should not be a boundary!</p>
<p class="bas indent1"><span class="nm">(i)</span><span class="cl">Answer:</span> "Ha'Aretz" is all one boundary. This does not include the Yarden.</p>
<p class="bas indent1"><span class="nm">(j)</span><span class="cl">Question:</span> According to R. Chiya, we understand why the Beraisa mentions the Yarden. (It is the only separation in Eretz Yisrael);</p>
<p class="bas indent2"><span class="nm">1.</span>However, according to R. Ami, why does the Beraisa mention the Yarden? (Every river separates!)</p>
<p class="bas indent1"><span class="nm">(k)</span>This is left difficult.</p>
<p class="bas indent1"><span class="nm">(l)</span>Tana'im argue about whether the Yarden is considered part of Eretz Yisrael;</p>
<p class="bas indent2"><span class="nm">1.</span><span class="cl">(Beraisa - R. Yehudah ben Beseira):</span> "Ki Atem Ovrim Es ha'Yarden Artzah Kena'an" - the land is considered Eretz Kena'an, but the Yarden is not.</p>
<p class="bas indent2"><span class="nm">2.</span>R. Shimon says, "me'Ever l'Yarden Yerecho Kedmah Mizrachah" teaches that just like Yericho is part of Eretz Kena'an, also the Yarden.</p>
<p class="bas indent1"><span class="nm">(m)</span><span class="cl">(Rabah bar bar Chanah):</span> Only the part of the Yarden below (downstream, south of) Yericho is considered the Yarden.</p>
<p class="bas indent1"><span class="nm">(n)</span><span class="cl">Question:</span> Concerning what law was this said?</p>
<p class="bas indent2"><span class="nm">1.</span>It is not concerning vows (e.g. not to drink from the Yarden), for vows are based on the way people speak. Also above Yericho is called the Yarden!</p>
<p class="bas indent1"><span class="nm">(o)</span><span class="cl">Answer:</span> It was said regarding Ma'aser Behemah.</p>
<p class="bas indent1"><span class="nm">(p)</span><span class="cl">Support (Beraisa):</span> The Yarden emanates from (a spring in) the Pamyas cave. It passes through the seas of Sivki and Tiveryah, and Sedom (Dead Sea), and falls into the Yam ha'Gadol;</p>
<p class="bas indent2"><span class="nm">1.</span>Only the part below Yericho is considered the Yarden.</p>
<p class="bas indent2"><span class="nm">2.</span><span class="cl">(R. Chiya bar Aba):</span> It is called Yarden because it is Yored mi'Dan (descends from a place called Dan).</p>
<p class="bas indent1"><span class="nm">(q)</span><span class="cl">R. Aba (to Rav Ashi):</span> We learn from a different source than you (that it comes from Dan).</p>
<p class="bas indent2"><span class="nm">1.</span><span class="cl">(R. Yitzchak):</span> "Va'Yikre'u Lo <i>l'Leshem</i> Dan" is Pamyas.</p>
<p class="bas indent2"><span class="nm">2.</span><span class="cl">(Beraisa):</span> The Yarden emanates from the Pamyas.</p>
<p class="bas indent1"><span class="nm">(r)</span><span class="cl">(Rav Kahana):</span> The primary source of the Yarden is the Pamyas;</p>
<p class="bas indent2"><span class="nm">1.</span>If one vowed not to drink from the Pamyas cave, he may not drink from any part of the Yarden.</p>
<p class="bas indent1"><span class="nm">(s)</span>The primary source of blood is the liver;</p>
<p class="bas indent2"><span class="nm">1.</span><span class="cl">(R. Yitzchak):</span> If a liver (of a Mes) dissolved, a Revi'is of it has Tumas Ohel (just like blood).</p>
<p class="bas subject"><span class="nm">3)</span>ALL WATER COMES FROM THE <i>PRAS</i> RIVER</p>
<p class="bas indent1"><span class="nm">(a)</span>The primary source of water is the Pras (Euphrates) River;</p>
<p class="bas indent2"><span class="nm">1.</span><span class="cl">(Rav Yehudah):</span> If one vowed from water of the Pras, he may not drink any water.</p>
<p class="bas indent2"><span class="nm">2.</span><span class="cl">Question:</span> What is the case?'</p>
<p class="bas indent3"><span class="nm">i.</span>If he vowed not to drink water of the Pras, he only intended to forbid what is called Pras, not other rivers!</p>
<p class="bas indent2"><span class="nm">3.</span><span class="cl">Answer:</span> He vowed not to drink water that comes from the Pras.</p>
<p class="bas indent3"><span class="nm">i.</span><span class="cl">(Rav Yehudah):</span> All rivers are below (and come from) three rivers (of the four in Gan Eden). The three are below the (fourth, the) Pras.</p>
<p class="bas indent3"><span class="nm">ii.</span><span class="cl">Question:</span> There are springs on mountains that are higher!</p>
<p class="bas bbbline">55b----------------------------------------55b</p>
<p class="bas indent3"><span class="nm">iii.</span><span class="cl">Answer (Rav Mesharshiya):</span> They originate in the Pras, the water goes up 'ladders' in the ground.</p>
<p class="bas indent3"><span class="nm">iv.</span><span class="cl">Question:</span> "Veha'Nahar ha'Revi'i Hu Feras" (shows that it is not considered more important than the others!)</p>
<p class="bas indent3"><span class="nm">v.</span><span class="cl">Answer (Rav Nachman bar Yitzchak):</span> It is the river mentioned at the beginning (from which all four rivers emanate).</p>
<p class="bas indent1"><span class="nm">(b)</span><span class="cl">(Beraisa - R. Meir):</span> The real name of Pras is Yuval - "v'Hayah k'Etz Shasul Al Mayim v'Al Yuval Yeshalach Sharashav";</p>
<p class="bas indent2"><span class="nm">1.</span>It is called Pras because its waters increase (even without rain).</p>
<p class="bas indent1"><span class="nm">(c)</span>This supports Shmuel, and is unlike Rav.</p>
<p class="bas indent2"><span class="nm">1.</span><span class="cl">(Shmuel):</span> A river's water is mostly from its Kipah (source; R. Gershom - banks.)</p>
<p class="bas indent2"><span class="nm">2.</span><span class="cl">(Rav):</span> When the Pras is fuller than usual, this shows that there was much rain in Eretz Yisrael (Rashi - from where it flows).</p>
<p class="bas indent1"><span class="nm">(d)</span>Shmuel's father made Mikva'os for his daughters in springtime, and put mats (on the river floor) for them in fall.</p>
<p class="bas indent1"><span class="nm">(e)</span>He made Mikva'os in springtime, because he holds like Rav, who attributes the extra water to Notfim (rain, or melting snow). He was concerned lest the river is mostly Notfim, and it is considered rainwater.</p>
<p class="bas indent2"><span class="nm">1.</span><span class="cl">Version #1 (Rashi):</span> Nowadays, any woman who sees blood is considered a Safek Zavah. She must immerse in Mayim Chayim (flowing water), i.e. the majority must be Zochlim (what comes from the source. Chasam Sofer (Y.D. 202) - Rashi agrees with most Meforshim, that mid'Oraisa, a Zavah does not need Mayim Chayim. He was stringent for his unmarried daughters, who immersed for Taharos (but not for his wife, who immersed primarily for relations), lest a Zav (who needs Mayim Chayim) likewise immerse there.)</p>
<p class="bas indent2"><span class="nm">2.</span><span class="cl">Version #2 (Rashi):</span> Even though water that flows from the ground to the river is called Zochlim, perhaps the river is mostly Notfim (rain that fell directly into the river).</p>
<p class="bas indent2"><span class="nm">3.</span><span class="cl">Version #3 (Tosfos):</span> Rainwater is Metaher only if it is gathered, but not if it is flowing. (Only Zochlim are Metaher when flowing, i.e. in a spring.)</p>
<p class="bas indent2"><span class="nm">4.</span><span class="cl">Version #4 (Ran Nedarim 40b):</span> He was concerned lest they immerse in an area where the river normally does not reach, and only now it (is wider and) reaches there due to the rainwater.</p>
<p class="bas indent1"><span class="nm">(f)</span>He put mats for them in fall, lest their feet be in mud, and it will be a Chatzitzah.</p>
<p class="bas indent1"><span class="nm">(g)</span><span class="cl">Version #1 (our text):</span> Shmuel contradicts what he said above (that a river's water is mostly from its Kipah):</p>
<p class="bas indent1"><span class="nm">(h)</span><span class="cl">Version #2 (brought in Rashi):</span> Shmuel argues with his father (who did not make Mikva'os until Nisan); (end of Version #2)</p>
<p class="bas indent2"><span class="nm">1.</span><span class="cl">(Shmuel):</span> The only water that is Metaher b'Zochlim is the Pras in Tishrei. (At all other times, we are concerned lest the majority is rainwater.)</p>
