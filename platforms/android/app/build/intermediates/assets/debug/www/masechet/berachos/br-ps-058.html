<p class="bas indent1"><span class="nm">(a)</span><span class="cl">(R. Yirmeyah ben Elazar):</span> Bavel was cursed, also its neighbors were cursed -- "v'Samtiha l'Morash Kipod v'Agmei Mayim" (wild birds will be there, they will damage the surrounding area);</p>
<p class="bas indent1"><span class="nm">(b)</span>Shomron (the capital of the ten tribes) was cursed, its neighbors were blessed -- "v'Samti Shomron l'Iy ha'Sadeh la'Mata'ei Charem" (it will be a vineyard, the neighbors will benefit from it).</p>
<p class="bas indent1"><span class="nm">(c)</span><span class="cl">(Rav Hamnuna):</span> If one sees a multitude of Jews, he says, "Blessed is He who knows secrets" (Rashi - each of their thoughts; Me'iri - all humanly attainable knowledge is possessed by such a crowd, only Hash-m knows what is beyond this);</p>
<p class="bas indent2"><span class="nm">1.</span>If one sees a multitude of Nochrim, he says, "Boshah Imchem..." (it is shameful to their mothers, who gave birth to people whose end is desolation).</p>
<p class="bas indent1"><span class="nm">(d)</span><span class="cl">(Beraisa):</span> If one sees a multitude of Jews, he says, "Blessed is He who knows secrets," for their minds are all unlike, their faces are all unlike.</p>
<p class="bas indent1"><span class="nm">(e)</span>While standing on a step in Har ha'Bayis, Ben Zoma saw a multitude of Jews; he said, "Blessed is He who knows secrets, and blessed is He who created all of these people to serve me."</p>
<p class="bas indent1"><span class="nm">(f)</span><span class="cl">Ben Zoma:</span> How hard it was for Adam ha'Rishon to get bread! He had to plow, plant, reap, make piles, thresh, winnow, select, grind, sift, knead and bake before he could eat -- I find all of these done for me!</p>
<p class="bas indent2"><span class="nm">1.</span>How hard it was for Adam to get clothing! He had to shear, clean the wool, unravel it, spin, and weave before he had clothing -- I find all of these done for me! All craftsmen come to my door (to sell me their wares; Ben Zoma was rich).</p>
<p class="bas indent1"><span class="nm">(g)</span><span class="cl">Ben Zoma:</span> A good guest says, "How much my host toiled for me! He brought so much meat in front of me, so much wine, so many rolls -- all his exertion was just for me!"</p>
<p class="bas indent2"><span class="nm">1.</span>A bad guest says, "What did my host toil for me? I ate just one roll, just one piece [of meat], I drank just one cup -- all his exertion was for his own household!"</p>
<p class="bas indent1"><span class="nm">(h)</span>Regarding the good guest it says, "Zechor Ki Sasgi Fa'alo Asher Shoreru Anashim" (Maharsha - the guest should aggrandize what his host did; alternatively, he should praise Hash-m for preparing people that fulfill all his needs);</p>
<p class="bas indent2"><span class="nm">1.</span>Regarding the bad guest it says, "Lachen Yere'uhu Anashim..." (man should fear Hash-m, for the wisest of men does not impress Him; likewise, a bad guest is not impressed by the greatest hospitality).</p>
<p class="bas indent1"><span class="nm">(i)</span><span class="cl">(Rava):</span> "Veha'Ish... Ba va'Anashim" -- this is Yishai, David's father, who was accompanied by a multitude when he went in or out, and he would teach to a multitude.</p>
<p class="bas indent1"><span class="nm">(j)</span><span class="cl">(Ula):</span> [The blessing for] a multitude does not apply in Bavel.</p>
<p class="bas indent1"><span class="nm">(k)</span><span class="cl">(Beraisa):</span> "Multitude" refers to at least 600,000 people.</p>
<p class="bas indent1"><span class="nm">(l)</span><span class="cl">(Beraisa):</span> If one sees Chachmei Yisrael, he says, "Blessed is He who apportioned from His wisdom to those who fear Him";</p>
<p class="bas indent2"><span class="nm">1.</span>If one sees Chachmei Nochrim, he says, "Blessed is He who gave from His wisdom to mortals" (text of Gra).</p>
<p class="bas indent1"><span class="nm">(m)</span>If one sees Yisrael kings, he says, "Blessed is He who apportioned from His honor to those who fear Him;</p>
<p class="bas indent2"><span class="nm">1.</span>If one sees Nochri kings, he says, "Blessed is He who gave from His honor to mortals."</p>
<p class="bas indent1"><span class="nm">(n)</span><span class="cl">(R. Yochanan):</span> One should strive to see Jewish kings, and even Nochri kings, so that if he merits, he will perceive the difference between Malchei Yisrael (Mashi'ach, in the World to Come) and Nochri kings.</p>
<p class="bas indent1"><span class="nm">(o)</span>Rav Sheshes was blind. Everyone was going to see the [Nochri] king; he went with them. He met up with a Tzeduki, who said, "We take intact vessels to draw water, not broken vessels! Why did you come? You will not see anything!"</p>
<p class="bas indent2"><span class="nm">1.</span><span class="cl">Rav Sheshes:</span> You will see that I know more than you do.</p>
<p class="bas indent2"><span class="nm">2.</span>A throng passed; when it became noisy, the Tzeduki said, "The king is coming!"</p>
<p class="bas indent2"><span class="nm">3.</span><span class="cl">Rav Sheshes:</span> He is not coming [yet].</p>
<p class="bas indent2"><span class="nm">4.</span>A second throng passed; when it became noisy, the Tzeduki said, "The king is coming!"</p>
<p class="bas indent2"><span class="nm">5.</span><span class="cl">Rav Sheshes:</span> He is not coming.</p>
<p class="bas indent2"><span class="nm">6.</span>A third throng passed; when it became quiet, Rav Sheshes said, "Surely, now the king is coming!"</p>
<p class="bas indent2"><span class="nm">7.</span><span class="cl">The Tzeduki:</span> How do you know?</p>
<p class="bas indent2"><span class="nm">8.</span><span class="cl">Rav Sheshes:</span> Earthly kings are a semblance of the Heavenly King -- "Lo va'Ru'ach Hash-m... Lo va'Ra'ash Hash-m... Lo va'Esh Hash-m v'Achar ha'Esh Kol Demamah Dakah."</p>
<p class="bas indent2"><span class="nm">9.</span>When the king came, Rav Sheshes blessed him.</p>
<p class="bas indent2"><span class="nm">10.</span><span class="cl">The Tzeduki:</span> Do you bless someone you do not see?!</p>
<p class="bas indent1"><span class="nm">(p)</span><span class="cl">Question:</span> What happened to the Tzeduki?</p>
<p class="bas indent1"><span class="nm">(q)</span><span class="cl">Answer #1:</span> His colleagues gouged out his eyes.</p>
<p class="bas indent1"><span class="nm">(r)</span><span class="cl">Answer #2:</span> Rav Sheshes put his eyes on him (Maharsha - he miraculously regained sight, in order to punish him; alternatively, he cursed him), and he became a pile of bones.</p>
<p class="bas subject"><span class="nm">2)</span>THE EPISODE OF RAV SHILA</p>
<p class="bas indent1"><span class="nm">(a)</span>Rav Shila lashed a man who had relations with a Mitzris. The man informed on him to the king, that there is a Jew who judges without permission of the king. The king sent to take Rav Shila.</p>
<p class="bas indent1"><span class="nm">(b)</span>They (the king's court) asked why he lashed the man; Rav Shila said, "He had relations with a donkey."</p>
<p class="bas indent1"><span class="nm">(c)</span>When asked if he has witnesses, Rav Shila answered, "Yes"; Eliyahu came in the guise of a man and testified.</p>
<p class="bas indent1"><span class="nm">(d)</span><span class="cl">The court:</span> If so, he is Chayav Misah!</p>
<p class="bas indent1"><span class="nm">(e)</span><span class="cl">Rav Shila:</span> Once we were exiled from our land, we may not execute; you may do as you see fit.</p>
<p class="bas indent1"><span class="nm">(f)</span>During the deliberations, Rav Shila said, "Lecha Hash-m ha'Gedulah..."; they asked what he was saying.</p>
<p class="bas indent1"><span class="nm">(g)</span><span class="cl">Rav Shila:</span> I praise Hash-m, who gave kingship below which is a semblance of His Kingship, and gave to you authority and love of justice (Rashi; Maharsha - you are merciful in judgment (he did not want the man to be killed, since he was not really Chayav Misah)).</p>
<p class="bas indent1"><span class="nm">(h)</span><span class="cl">The court:</span> Since you love judgment so much, here is a staff [to enforce your authority], go judge!</p>
<p class="bas indent1"><span class="nm">(i)</span>After they left, the man bewailed, "Miracles are done for a liar" (I did not have relations with a donkey)!</p>
<p class="bas indent1"><span class="nm">(j)</span><span class="cl">Rav Shila:</span> Mitzriyim are equated to donkeys -- "Asher Besar Chamorim Besaram."</p>
<p class="bas indent1"><span class="nm">(k)</span>Rav Shila saw that the man was going to report this to the king. Rav Shila reasoned -- he seeks to kill me; the Torah says, if someone seeks to kill you, kill him first! He hit him with the staff and killed him.</p>
<p class="bas indent1"><span class="nm">(l)</span><span class="cl">Rav Shila:</span> Since a miracle was done for me through this verse, I will expound it:</p>
<p class="bas indent2"><span class="nm">1.</span>"Lecha Hash-m ha'Gedulah" refers to the works of creation, as it says "Oseh Gedolos Ad Ein Cheker";</p>
<p class="bas indent2"><span class="nm">2.</span>"Veha'Gevurah refers to Yetzi'as Mitzrayim -- "va'Yar Yisrael Es <i>ha'Yad ha'Gedolah</i>..." (this refers to mighty acts);</p>
<p class="bas indent2"><span class="nm">3.</span>"Veha'Tif'eres" refers to the sun and moon standing still for Yehoshua (it made him famous);</p>
<p class="bas indent2"><span class="nm">4.</span>"Veha'Netzach" refers to the fall of Rome -- "v'Yez Nitzcham Al Begadai...";</p>
<p class="bas indent2"><span class="nm">5.</span>"Veha'Hod" refers to the war in the valley of Arnon (above, 54a-b);</p>
<p class="bas indent2"><span class="nm">6.</span>"Ki Chol ba'Shamayim uva'Aretz" refers to the war against Sisera -- "Min Shamayim Nilchamu ha'Kochavim...";</p>
<p class="bas indent2"><span class="nm">7.</span>"Lecha Hash-m ha'Mamlachah" refers to the war against Amalek -- "Ki Yad Al Kes Kah" (His throne alludes to His kingship);</p>
<p class="bas indent2"><span class="nm">8.</span>"Veha'Misnasei" refers to the war of Gog and Magog -- "Gog Nesi Rosh...."</p>
<p class="bas indent2"><span class="nm">9.</span><span class="cl">(R. Chanan bar Rava):</span> "L'Chol l'Rosh" -- Shamayim decrees [all authority, even] who will supervise the digging of water pits.</p>
<p class="bas indent2"><span class="nm">10.</span><span class="cl">(Beraisa - R. Akiva):</span> "Lecha Hash-m ha'Gedulah" refers to Keri'as Yam Suf; "veha'Gevurah" refers to Makas Bechoros; "veha'Tif'eres" refers to Matan Torah; "veha'Netzach" refers to Yerushalayim; "veha'Hod" refers to the Beis ha'Mikdash.</p>

<p class="bas subject"><span class="nm">3)</span>BLESSINGS ON DESOLATION</p>
<p class="bas indent1"><span class="nm">(a)</span><span class="cl">(Beraisa):</span> If one sees houses of [rich] Jews settled [in Eretz Yisrael during the time of the second Beis ha'Mikdash], he says, "Blessed is He who establishes the boundary of the widow";</p>
<p class="bas indent2"><span class="nm">1.</span>If he sees them in desolation, he says, "Baruch Dayan ha'Emes."</p>
<p class="bas indent1"><span class="nm">(b)</span>If one sees houses of Nochrim settled, he says, "Beis Ge'im Yisach Hash-m" (they should be uprooted);</p>
<p class="bas indent2"><span class="nm">1.</span>If he sees them in desolation, he says, "Kel Nekamos Hash-m Kel Nekamos Hofi'ah."</p>
<p class="bas indent1"><span class="nm">(c)</span>Ula and Rav Chisda were traveling; when they passed by the [desolate] house of Rav Chana bar Chanilai, Rav Chisda sighed.</p>
<p class="bas indent1"><span class="nm">(d)</span><span class="cl">Ula:</span> You should not sigh! Rav taught that sighing breaks half the body -- "... He'anach b'Shivron Masnayim!"</p>
<p class="bas indent2"><span class="nm">1.</span><span class="cl">(R. Yochanan):</span> It breaks the whole body -- "... Al Mah Atah Ne'enach; v'Names Kol Lev."</p>
<p class="bas indent1"><span class="nm">(e)</span><span class="cl">Rav Chisda:</span> How can I not sigh? In his house were 60 bakers during the day and 60 at night, for anyone hungry;</p>
<p class="bas indent2"><span class="nm">1.</span>Rav Chana never took his hand out of his wallet, lest someone who lost his wealth come (for Tzedakah), and when I reach for my wallet he will be embarrassed;</p>
<p class="bas indent2"><span class="nm">2.</span>He had doors in all four directions; anyone who entered hungry left satiated.</p>
<p class="bas indent2"><span class="nm">3.</span>In famine years, they would throw wheat and barley outside, so people who were embarrassed to take during the day could take at night.</p>
<p class="bas indent2"><span class="nm">4.</span>Now his house is a mound -- how can I not sigh?!</p>
<p class="bas indent1"><span class="nm">(f)</span><span class="cl">(Ula citing R. Yochanan):</span> From the day of the Churban it was decreed that houses of Tzadikim would be destroyed -- "... Batim Rabim l'Shamah Yiheyu Gedolim v'Tovim me'Ein Yoshev."</p>
<p class="bas indent2"><span class="nm">1.</span><span class="cl">(R. Yochanan):</span> In the future, Hash-m will resettle them -- "... ha'Botchim ba'Shem [Yiheyu] k'Har Tziyon" -- just like Hash-m will resettle Har Tziyon, He will resettle houses of Tzadikim.</p>
<p class="bas indent1"><span class="nm">(g)</span>Ula saw that Rav Chisda was not comforted -- he said, "It suffices for the slave to be like his Master [His house is desolate]."</p>
<p class="bas indent1"><span class="nm">(h)</span><span class="cl">(Beraisa):</span> If one sees graves of Jews, he says, "Blessed is He who created you b'Din (according to strict justice), and fed and financed you b'Din, and killed you b'Din, and will later revive you b'Din."</p>
<p class="bas indent1"><span class="nm">(i)</span><span class="cl">(Mar brei d'Ravina):</span> The Beraisa concludes, "And He knows your number and in the future will revive and sustain you; Baruch Mechayeh ha'Mesim."</p>
<p class="bas indent1"><span class="nm">(j)</span>If one sees graves of Nochrim, he says "Boshah Imchem...."</p>
<p class="bas indent1"><span class="nm">(k)</span><span class="cl">(R. Yehoshua ben Levi):</span> If one sees a friend for the first time in 30 days, he blesses Shehecheyanu;</p>
<p class="bas indent2"><span class="nm">1.</span>If one sees a friend for the first time in 12 months, he says, "Baruch Mechayeh ha'Mesim."</p>
<p class="bas indent1"><span class="nm">(l)</span><span class="cl">(Rav):</span> A Mes is not forgotten until 12 months -- "Nishkachti k'Mes mi'Lev Hayisi chi'Chli Oved" (one despairs from a lost vessel after 12 months).</p>
<p class="bas indent1"><span class="nm">(m)</span>Rav Papa and Rav Huna brei d'Rav Yehoshua were walking; they encountered Rav Chanina brei d'Rav Ika.

<p class="bas indent1"><span class="nm">(n)</span><span class="cl">Rav Chanina:</span> To me, you are like 600,000 Jews (you possess all forms of wisdom) -- for seeing you, I can make the two blessings you mentioned, as well as "Blessed is He who knows secrets."</p>
<p class="bas indent1"><span class="nm">(o)</span>Version #1 (Ramban, in Milchamos Hash-m) Rav Papa and Rav Huna: You must be such a Chacham [to see from our faces that we contain all forms of wisdom]! (Ben Yehoyada - also, saying, "To me, you are like 600,000," was an ingenious way to show humility, as opposed to denying that he is worthy of the blessing they made on him.)</p>
<p class="bas indent1"><span class="nm">(p)</span><span class="cl">Version #2 (Bach, OC 224) Rav Papa and Rav Huna:</span> Are you such a Chacham (to rely on your wisdom to make a blessing for which you have no tradition)?! (End of Version #2)</p>
<p class="bas indent1"><span class="nm">(q)</span>They put their eyes on him, and he died (Bach - because he made a Berachah l'Vatalah; Ramban - from Ayin ha'Ra; Ben Yehoyada - they had an intrinsic Midah of Gevurah which automatically brought Din upon him).</p>
<p class="bas subject"><span class="nm">4)</span>BLESSINGS FOR UNUSUAL THINGS</p>
<p class="bas indent1"><span class="nm">(a)</span><span class="cl">(R. Yehoshua ben Levi):</span> If one sees a freckled person, he says, "Baruch Meshaneh ha'Beriyos" (who varies the created beings).</p>
<p class="bas indent1"><span class="nm">(b)</span><span class="cl">Question (Beraisa):</span> If one sees a person who is black, red, very white, with an oversized stomach (alternatively, very tall), a midget, or with warts (alternatively, with a crooked mouth), he says, "Baruch Meshaneh ha'Beriyos";</p>
<p class="bas indent2"><span class="nm">1.</span>If one sees someone missing an arm or leg, blind, or his hair sticks together (Rashi; Aruch - his head is oval-shaped), stricken with boils, or freckled, he says, "Baruch Dayan ha'Emes."</p>
<p class="bas indent1"><span class="nm">(c)</span><span class="cl">Answer:</span> R. Yehoshua ben Levi discusses someone born freckled, the Beraisa discusses when this happened after he was born.</p>
<p class="bas indent1"><span class="nm">(d)</span><span class="cl">Support:</span> Presumably, all cases in the Beraisa resemble one missing a limb, which happened after he was born!</p>
<p class="bas indent1"><span class="nm">(e)</span><span class="cl">(Beraisa):</span> If one sees an elephant, ape or Kafuf (Rashi - vulture), he says, "Baruch Meshaneh ha'Beriyos."</p>
<p class="bas indent1"><span class="nm">(f)</span>If one sees nice creatures or trees, he says, "Blessed is He who has such in His world."</p>
<p class="bas indent1"><span class="nm">(g)</span><span class="cl">(Mishnah):</span> On Zikin [one says "Blessed is He whose might fills the world"].</p>
<p class="bas indent1"><span class="nm">(h)</span><span class="cl">Question:</span> What are Zikin?</p>
<p class="bas indent1"><span class="nm">(i)</span><span class="cl">Answer [#1] (Shmuel):</span> They are shooting stars.</p>
<p class="bas indent2"><span class="nm">1.</span><span class="cl">Shmuel:</span> I know the pathways in the sky like the streets of my city, except for shooting stars -- I do not know what they are;</p>
<p class="bas indent2"><span class="nm">2.</span>We have a tradition -- they do not pass the constellation Kesil;</p>

<p class="bas indent2"><span class="nm">2.</span><span class="cl">Answer #2 (or #3) (Rav Ashi):</span> A star on one side of Kesil starts to move, another star on the other side gets afraid and moves, it <i>looks like</i> a star passed Kesil.</p>
