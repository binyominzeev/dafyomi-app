<p class="bas subject"><span class="nm">1)</span>AUTHORIZATION</p>
<p class="bas indent1"><span class="nm">(a)</span><span class="cl">Version #1 (Chachamim of Nehardai):</span> One cannot write an Orkesa (power of attorney) for Metaltelim (movable objects).</p>
<p class="bas indent1"><span class="nm">(b)</span><span class="cl">Question (Rav Ashi):</span> What is the reason?</p>
<p class="bas indent1"><span class="nm">(c)</span><span class="cl">Answer (Ameimar):</span> It is due to R. Yochanan's law;</p>
<p class="bas indent2"><span class="nm">1.</span><span class="cl">(R. Yochanan):</span> If something was stolen and the owner did not despair, neither the thief nor owner can make it Hekdesh;</p>
<p class="bas indent2"><span class="nm">2.</span>The thief cannot, for it is not his. The owner cannot, for it is not in his Reshus!</p>
<p class="bas indent1"><span class="nm">(d)</span><span class="cl">Version #2 (Chachamim of Nehardai):</span> One may not write an Orkesa for contested Metaltelim.</p>
<p class="bas indent1"><span class="nm">(e)</span><span class="cl">Inference:</span> This is only because it looks like Sheker (since another contests this). If they were not contested, one may write it! (end of Version #2)</p>
<p class="bas indent1"><span class="nm">(f)</span><span class="cl">(Chachamim of Nehardai):</span> If Reuven wrote an Orkesa to authorize Levi, and it does not say 'go claim and acquire for yourself', it is void.</p>
<p class="bas indent1"><span class="nm">(g)</span><span class="cl">Question:</span> What is the reason?</p>
<p class="bas indent1"><span class="nm">(h)</span><span class="cl">Answer:</span> The one from whom Levi claims (Shimon) can say to him 'you have no claim against me.'</p>
<p class="bas indent1"><span class="nm">(i)</span><span class="cl">(Abaye):</span> If it says that Levi receives a percentage of the property, since he has a claim on his percentage, he can argue the case for all the property.</p>
<p class="bas indent1"><span class="nm">(j)</span><span class="cl">(Ameimar):</span> If Levi seized the property (and refuses to return it to Reuven; some explain, if he seized from Shimon with an invalid Orkesa), he keeps it.</p>
<p class="bas indent1"><span class="nm">(k)</span><span class="cl">Version #1 (Rav Ashi):</span> No. Since Reuven wrote "all (Meiri - gains or) losses you incur, is upon me', Levi is merely a Shali'ach.</p>
<p class="bas indent1"><span class="nm">(l)</span><span class="cl">Version #2:</span> He is a partner. (end of Version #2)</p>
<p class="bas indent1"><span class="nm">(m)</span><span class="cl">Question:</span> What difference does it make if he is a Shali'ach or partner?</p>
<p class="bas indent1"><span class="nm">(n)</span><span class="cl">Answer:</span> If he is a partner, he may keep half for himself.</p>
<p class="bas indent1"><span class="nm">(o)</span>The Halachah is, he is a Shali'ach.</p>
<p class="bas subject"><span class="nm">2)</span>TESTIMONY MUST BE ABOUT A FULL MATTER</p>
<p class="bas indent1"><span class="nm">(a)</span><span class="cl">(Mishnah):</span> If one stole in front of two witnesses, and slaughtered or sold in front of them or two other witnesses, he pays four and five;</p>
<p class="bas indent1"><span class="nm">(b)</span><span class="cl">In all these cases, he pays four and five:</span> he stole and sold on Shabbos, or to idolatry;</p>
<p class="bas indent2"><span class="nm">1.</span>He stole and slaughtered on Yom Kipur;</p>
<p class="bas indent2"><span class="nm">2.</span>He stole from his father and slaughtered or sold, and then his father died;</p>
<p class="bas indent2"><span class="nm">3.</span>He stole and slaughtered, and then made it Hekdesh.</p>
<p class="bas indent1"><span class="nm">(c)</span>If he stole and slaughtered for medicinal needs, or to feed to dogs, or the animal was found to be Tereifah, or he slaughtered Chulin ba'Azarah (in the Mikdash); he pays four or five;</p>
<p class="bas indent1"><span class="nm">(d)</span>R. Shimon exempts for these (last) two.</p>
<p class="bas indent1"><span class="nm">(e)</span><span class="cl">(Gemara) Suggestion:</span> The Mishnah is unlike R. Akiva, for he holds that testimony must be about a full matter.</p>
<p class="bas indent2"><span class="nm">1.</span><span class="cl">(Beraisa - Aba Chalafta and R. Yochanan ben Nuri):</span> If three different pairs of witnesses saw Reuven living on Shimon's land, and each pair saw this for a different year (for three consecutive years), this is a Chazakah (demonstration of ownership. Reuven is believed to say 'I bought it from you, and I lost my document of purchase.)</p>
<p class="bas bbbline">70b----------------------------------------70b</p>
<p class="bas indent2"><span class="nm">2.</span>R. Akiva says, it is not a Chazakah. Witnesses must testify about a (full) "Davar (matter)", not half a Davar. (Living on Shimon's land for one year has no significance. Similarly, the testimony about slaughter has no significance by itself.)</p>
<p class="bas indent1"><span class="nm">(f)</span><span class="cl">Rejection (Abaye):</span> R. Akiva can agree to our Mishnah!</p>
<p class="bas indent2"><span class="nm">1.</span>He surely agrees that if two witnesses saw David be Mekadesh Leah, and two others saw Menasheh have Bi'ah with her, even though the latter testimony has no significance without the former, since the first witnesses do not need the latter, all the testimony stands;</p>
<p class="bas indent2"><span class="nm">2.</span>Here also, even though the latter witnesses (about the slaughter) need the former witnesses (about the theft), since the former do not need the latter, all the testimony stands!</p>
<p class="bas indent1"><span class="nm">(g)</span><span class="cl">Question:</span> In what case do Chachamim invalidate testimony because it is only half a "Davar"?</p>
<p class="bas indent1"><span class="nm">(h)</span><span class="cl">Answer #1:</span> One witness saw that a girl (above 12 years  old) has one (pubic) hair on her back, and one witness saw one hair on her front. (She is an adult only if she brought two hairs.)</p>
<p class="bas indent1"><span class="nm">(i)</span><span class="cl">Rejection:</span> That is half-testimony (only one witness saw each hair)!</p>
<p class="bas indent1"><span class="nm">(j)</span><span class="cl">Answer #2:</span> Two witnesses saw one hair on her back, and two saw one hair on her front.</p>
<p class="bas indent2"><span class="nm">1.</span>This is a half-Davar, since each pair of witnesses testifies that she is still a minor!</p>
<p class="bas subject"><span class="nm">3)</span>ONE LIABLE TO DIE DOES NOT PAY</p>
<p class="bas indent1"><span class="nm">(a)</span><span class="cl">(Mishnah):</span> If he stole and sold on Shabbos...</p>
<p class="bas indent1"><span class="nm">(b)</span><span class="cl">Contradiction (Beraisa):</span> He is exempt.</p>
<p class="bas indent1"><span class="nm">(c)</span><span class="cl">Answer #1 (Rami bar Chama):</span> The Beraisa discusses when Levi (the buyer) told Reuven (the thief) 'pick a date from my tree to be payment for the stolen item.' (Since Reuven is liable to die for detaching on Shabbos, he is exempt from the fine due to the sale that resulted from this action.)</p>
<p class="bas indent1"><span class="nm">(d)</span><span class="cl">Rejection:</span> Since Levi cannot force Reuven to give him anything (since Reuven is Chayav Misah for Chilul Shabbos), this is not a sale at all!</p>
<p class="bas indent1"><span class="nm">(e)</span><span class="cl">Answer #2 (Rav Papa):</span> In the Beraisa, Levi told Reuven 'throw the stolen item into my yard so I will acquire it'.</p>
<p class="bas indent1"><span class="nm">(f)</span><span class="cl">Suggestion:</span> This is like R. Akiva, who considers an airborne object as if it rests on the ground below. (The item is acquired when it enters the airspace of Levi's yard. That is also when Reuven is liable for Chilul Shabbos.)</p>
<p class="bas indent2"><span class="nm">1.</span>Chachamim hold that the item is acquired when it enters Levi's airspace; but Reuven is not liable until it lands.</p>
<p class="bas indent1"><span class="nm">(g)</span><span class="cl">Rejection:</span> It is even like Chachamim. The case is, Levi said 'I do not want to acquire until it rests on the ground.'</p>
<p class="bas indent1"><span class="nm">(h)</span><span class="cl">Defense (of Answer #1 - Rava):</span> The Torah forbade the wages of a harlot (to be a Korban) in every case, even if one paid his mother for Bi'ah with her;</p>
<p class="bas indent2"><span class="nm">1.</span>Even though Beis Din cannot make him pay what he promised her (since he is Chayav Misah for Bi'ah with her), if he pays, it is considered a harlot's wages.</p>
<p class="bas indent2"><span class="nm">2.</span>Here also, even though Beis Din cannot force Reuven to give Levi the animal (for which Levi paid a date), if Reuven gives it, it was a sale.</p>
