<p class="bas subject"><span class="nm">1)</span>OTHER LAWS OF <i>IR HA'NIDACHAS</i></p>
<p class="bas indent1"><span class="nm">(a)</span><span class="cl">(Mishnah):</span> Kisvei ha'Kodesh are buried.</p>
<p class="bas indent1"><span class="nm">(b)</span>Our Mishnah is not like R. Eliezer.</p>
<p class="bas indent2"><span class="nm">1.</span><span class="cl">(Beraisa - R. Eliezer):</span> If there is even one Mezuzah in a city, it cannot become an Ir ha'Nidachas.</p>
<p class="bas indent1"><span class="nm">(c)</span><span class="cl">Question:</span> What is his reason?</p>
<p class="bas indent1"><span class="nm">(d)</span><span class="cl">Answer:</span> We must fulfill "v'Es Kol Shelalah... v'Sarafta";</p>
<p class="bas indent2"><span class="nm">1.</span>We cannot burn a Mezuzah - "Lo Sa'ason Ken la'Shem Elokeichem."</p>
<p class="bas indent1"><span class="nm">(e)</span><span class="cl">(Mishnah - R. Shimon):</span> Hash-m says...  (R. Yosi ha'Galili forbids using the city for gardens or orchards. R. Akiva permits.)</p>
<p class="bas indent1"><span class="nm">(f)</span><span class="cl">Suggestion:</span> R. Yosi ha'Galili and R. Akiva argue about R. Avin's law.</p>
<p class="bas indent2"><span class="nm">1.</span><span class="cl">(R. Avin):</span> Wherever a Klal (general term) is given in a Mitzvas Aseh, and a Prat (specific term) in a Lav, we do not expound according to Klal u'Frat.</p>
<p class="bas indent2"><span class="nm">2.</span>R. Akiva argues with R. Avin. ("V'Haysah Tel Olam" is a Klal (it forbids everything, even gardens). "Lo Sibaneh Od" is a Prat (it forbids houses). From a Klal u'Frat we only learn the Prat. Only houses are forbidden;</p>
<p class="bas indent2"><span class="nm">3.</span>R. Yosi ha'Galili holds like R. Avin. He does not expound the Klal u'Frat. The Aseh forbids everything, and houses are forbidden also with a Lav.</p>
<p class="bas indent1"><span class="nm">(g)</span><span class="cl">Rejection:</span> No, all agree with R. Avin. They argue about how to expound "Od";</p>
<p class="bas indent2"><span class="nm">1.</span>R. Yosi ha'Galili expounds "Od" - it may not be rebuilt at all;</p>
<p class="bas indent2"><span class="nm">2.</span>R. Akiva expounds, it may not be rebuilt like it was (but gardens are permitted).</p>
<p class="bas subject"><span class="nm">2)</span>REBUILDING YERICHO</p>
<p class="bas indent1"><span class="nm">(a)</span><span class="cl">(Mishnah - R. Akiva):</span> It may not be rebuilt like it was, but gardens and orchards are permitted.</p>
<p class="bas indent1"><span class="nm">(b)</span><span class="cl">(Beraisa):</span> Uprooted trees in the city are forbidden. Attached trees are permitted;</p>
<p class="bas indent2"><span class="nm">1.</span>In another city, both attached and detached are forbidden.</p>
<p class="bas indent1"><span class="nm">(c)</span><span class="cl">Question:</span> What does 'in another city' refer to?</p>
<p class="bas indent1"><span class="nm">(d)</span><span class="cl">Answer (Rav Chisda):</span> It refers to Yericho - "v'Haysah ha'Ir Cherem (Hi v'Chol Asher Bah) la'Shem."</p>
<p class="bas indent1"><span class="nm">(e)</span><span class="cl">(Beraisa):</span> "Va'Yashba Yehoshua...  Arur ha'Ish...  Asher Yakum u'Vanah <i>Es ha'Ir ha'Zos Es Yericho</i> bi'Vchoro Yeyasdenah uvi'Tz'iro Yatziv Delaseha" - one may not rebuild Yericho, even with a different name, and no city may be built and called Yericho;</p>
<p class="bas indent2"><span class="nm">1.</span>"Banah Chi'el Beis ha'Eli (and he called it) Es Yericho ba'Aviram Bechoro Yisdah uvi'Sguv Tz'iro Hitziv Delaseha." (Ramah - alternatively, he rebuilt Yericho with a different name.)</p>
<p class="bas indent1"><span class="nm">(f)</span><span class="cl">(Beraisa):</span> Granted, he did not realize that his firstborn died due to the curse, for Aviram was a Rasha. However, he should have realized that Seguv died due to the curse!</p>
<p class="bas indent1"><span class="nm">(g)</span><span class="cl">Objection:</span> We have no source that Aviram or Seguv was a Rasha!</p>
<p class="bas indent1"><span class="nm">(h)</span><span class="cl">Correction:</span> Rather, Chi'el was a Rasha. He should have realized that Aviram died due to the curse.</p>
<p class="bas indent1"><span class="nm">(i)</span><span class="cl">Question:</span> Since it says that Aviram was his firstborn, we know that Seguv was younger!</p>
<p class="bas indent1"><span class="nm">(j)</span><span class="cl">Answer:</span> This teaches that he kept burying his intermediate children while he was building it.</p>
<p class="bas indent1"><span class="nm">(k)</span>Achav was his close friend. Eliyahu and Achav came to visit him during his mourning (Ramah - to find the reason for his punishment).</p>
<p class="bas indent2"><span class="nm">1.</span><span class="cl">Achav:</span> Perhaps Yehoshua cursed that Yericho may not be rebuilt, even by a different name, and no city may be built and called Yericho;</p>
<p class="bas indent2"><span class="nm">2.</span><span class="cl">Eliyahu:</span> You are Correct!</p>
<p class="bas indent2"><span class="nm">3.</span><span class="cl">Achav:</span> Moshe's curse was not fulfilled. It says "va'Avadtem (if you will serve idolatry)...  v'Lo Yihyeh Matar." I put idolatry in every furrow (in Eretz Yisrael), yet there is so much rain, that it is hard to go to serve them! Why was the curse of his Talmid (Yehoshua) fulfilled?!</p>
<p class="bas indent2"><span class="nm">4.</span>Immediately, Eliyahu swore "Chai Hash-m...  Im Yihyeh...  Tal u'Matar (rain will come only through my decree)." He prayed, and Hash-m gave to him the key to rain.</p>
<p class="bas subject"><span class="nm">3)</span>ELIYAHU WITHHELD THE RAIN</p>
<p class="bas indent1"><span class="nm">(a)</span><span class="cl">Question:</span> "(Hash-m told him) v'Nistarta b'Nachal... veha'Orvim Mevi'im Lo Lechem u'Vasar ba'Boker." Where did the bread and meat come from?</p>
<p class="bas indent1"><span class="nm">(b)</span><span class="cl">Answer (Rav Yehudah):</span> They took it from Achav's slaughter house. (Ovadyah, a Tzadik, slaughtered it.).</p>
<p class="bas indent1"><span class="nm">(c)</span>"Va'Yivash ha'Nachal Ki Lo Hayah Geshem" - Hash-m saw that the drought was paining Yisrael, so he told Eliyahu to go to Tzarfas;</p>
<p class="bas indent2"><span class="nm">1.</span>"Chalah Ben ha'Ishah" - Eliyahu prayed for the key of revival of the dead to revive the son (of the widow who gave to him to eat)..</p>
<p class="bas indent2"><span class="nm">2.</span><span class="cl">Hash-m:</span> I have three keys that I never entrusted to a Shali'ach (Rashi - except for you; Tosfos (Ta'anis 2a) - permanently) - birth, rain and Techiyas ha'Mesim. It is not proper that (you) the Talmid hold two, and the Rebbi holds only one;</p>
<p class="bas indent2"><span class="nm">3.</span>Return the key of rain to me, and I will give to you the key of Techiyas ha'Mesim. (Eliyahu did so.) "Lech He'ra'eh El Achav v'Etnah Matar" (tell Achav that there will be rain).</p>
<p class="bas indent1"><span class="nm">(d)</span><span class="cl">A man of Galil:</span> A parable explains this. A man locked his gate and lost the key, so he was not the one to open it. (Likewise, Eliyahu stopped the rain, so he did not restore it.)</p>
<p class="bas indent1"><span class="nm">(e)</span>Eliyahu used to come to R. Yosi's Beis Medrash. R. Yosi once taught 'our teacher Eliyahu was a Kapdan (temperamental)'. Eliyahu did not come for three days. When he came, R. Yosi asked why he had not come for three days.</p>
<p class="bas bbbline">113b----------------------------------------113b</p>
<p class="bas indent2"><span class="nm">1.</span><span class="cl">Eliyahu:</span> It is because you called me a Kapdan.</p>
<p class="bas indent2"><span class="nm">2.</span><span class="cl">R. Yosi:</span> This shows that you are a Kapdan!</p>
<p class="bas subject"><span class="nm">4)</span>THE COMING AND GOING OF RESHA'IM AND TZADIKIM</p>
<p class="bas indent1"><span class="nm">(a)</span><span class="cl">(Mishnah):</span> "V'Lo Yidbak b'Yadcha Me'umah Min ha'Cherem" - as long as there are Resha'im in the world, Hash-m's anger is in the world...</p>
<p class="bas indent1"><span class="nm">(b)</span><span class="cl">Question:</span> Which Resha'im does the Mishnah refer to?</p>
<p class="bas indent1"><span class="nm">(c)</span><span class="cl">Answer (Rav Yosef):</span> It refers to thieves.</p>
<p class="bas indent1"><span class="nm">(d)</span><span class="cl">(Beraisa):</span> When a Rasha enters the world, anger enters the world - "b'Vo Rasha Ba Gam Buz..."</p>
<p class="bas indent2"><span class="nm">1.</span>When a Rasha leaves the world, good comes to the world - "uva'Avod Resha'im Rinah."</p>
<p class="bas indent1"><span class="nm">(e)</span>When a Tzadik leaves the world, evil comes to the world - "Mipnei (before) ha'Ra'ah Ne'esaf ha'Tzadik";</p>
<p class="bas indent2"><span class="nm">1.</span>When a Tzadik comes to the world, good comes to the world - "Zeh (Noach) Yenachamenu mi'Ma'asenu umi'Etzvon Yadenu."</p>
