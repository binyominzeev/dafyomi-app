<p class="bas subject"><span class="nm">1)</span>SANCTIFICATION OF THE FESTIVALS</p>
<p class="bas indent1"><span class="nm">(a)</span><span class="cl">Question:</span> Beis Shamai do not learn the Gezerah Shavah. What is their source that three commoners can annul a vow?</p>
<p class="bas indent1"><span class="nm">(b)</span><span class="cl">Answer (Beraisa - R. Yosi ha'Galili):</span> "Va'Ydaber Moshe Es Mo'adei Hash-m El Bnei Yisrael" - the festivals were said, but Shabbos was not;</p>
<p class="bas indent2"><span class="nm">1.</span>Ben Azai says, the festivals were said, but the passage of vows was not said.</p>
<p class="bas indent1"><span class="nm">(c)</span><span class="cl">Question (Rav Yosi bar Noson):</span> What is the meaning of 'Shabbos was not said'?</p>
<p class="bas indent1"><span class="nm">(d)</span><span class="cl">Answer (Rav Sheshes):</span> The festivals depend on Kidush Beis Din (deciding which day is Rosh Chodesh), but Shabbos does not.</p>
<p class="bas indent2"><span class="nm">1.</span>One might have thought that since Shabbos is mentioned with the Mo'adim, it also needs Kidush Beis Din. He teaches that this is not so.</p>
<p class="bas indent1"><span class="nm">(e)</span><span class="cl">Question:</span> What is the meaning of 'the festivals were said, but vows were not said'?</p>
<p class="bas indent1"><span class="nm">(f)</span><span class="cl">Answer:</span> Kidush of the festivals (through Kidush Rosh Chodesh) requires experts, but annulment of vows does not require experts.</p>
<p class="bas indent1"><span class="nm">(g)</span><span class="cl">Question:</span> "Roshei ha'Matos" is written regarding vows!</p>
<p class="bas indent1"><span class="nm">(h)</span><span class="cl">Answer (Rav Chisda):</span> Only an expert can annul a vow by himself. (For commoners to annul, there must be three.)</p>
<p class="bas subject"><span class="nm">2)</span>THE 15TH OF AV</p>
<p class="bas indent1"><span class="nm">(a)</span><span class="cl">(Mishnah - R. Shimon ben Gamliel):</span> Yisrael did not have days as joyous as Yom Kipur and the 15th of Av.</p>
<p class="bas indent2"><span class="nm">1.</span>On these days, girls of Yerushalayim went out in white clothing. Every girl borrowed, so a girl that did not have would not be embarrassed.</p>
<p class="bas indent1"><span class="nm">(b)</span>We understand why Yom Kipur was so festive. It is the day of pardon and forgiveness, the day the second Luchos were given!</p>
<p class="bas indent1"><span class="nm">(c)</span><span class="cl">Question:</span> What was special about the 15th of Av?</p>
<p class="bas indent1"><span class="nm">(d)</span><span class="cl">Answer #1 (Rav Yehudah):</span> It was the day that intermarriage between the tribes was permitted.</p>
<p class="bas indent2"><span class="nm">1.</span><span class="cl">Question:</span> What Scriptural source did they have to permit this?</p>
<p class="bas indent2"><span class="nm">2.</span><span class="cl">Answer:</span> "Zeh ha'Davar (a daughter who inherits must marry within her tribe)" applies only to this generation.</p>
<p class="bas indent1"><span class="nm">(e)</span><span class="cl">Answer #2 (Rabah bar bar Chanah):</span> On this day, men of Binyamin were permitted to marry women of other tribes.</p>
<p class="bas indent2"><span class="nm">1.</span>"Yisrael Nishba ba'Mitzpah Leimor Ish Mimenu Lo Yiten Bito l'Vinyamin l'Ishah" (after the war against Binyamin, the other tribes swore not to marry off their daughters to men of Binyamin).</p>
<p class="bas indent2"><span class="nm">2.</span><span class="cl">Question:</span> What Scriptural source did they have to later permit this?</p>
<p class="bas indent2"><span class="nm">3.</span><span class="cl">Answer:</span> The oath applies to "Mimenu" (us), but not to our children.</p>
<p class="bas indent1"><span class="nm">(f)</span><span class="cl">Answer #3 (Rav Dimi bar Yosef):</span> On this day, the generation that left Mitzrayim ceased dying in the wilderness.</p>
<p class="bas indent2"><span class="nm">1.</span>"Cha'asher Tamu Kol Anshei ha'Milchamah Lamus...; <i>Va'Ydaber</i> Hash-m Elai" - (from the time of the Meraglim,) until they all died, Hash-m did not speak with Moshe (so closely).</p>
<p class="bas bbbline">121b----------------------------------------121b</p>
<p class="bas indent1"><span class="nm">(g)</span><span class="cl">Answer #4 (Ula):</span> On this day Hoshe'ah ben Elah abolished the guards that Yeravam had set up to prevent people of the 10 tribes from ascending to Yerushalayim for the festivals.</p>
<p class="bas indent1"><span class="nm">(h)</span><span class="cl">Answer #5 (Rav Masneh):</span> On this day they were able to bury those killed in Beitar (at the time of the Churban).</p>
<p class="bas indent2"><span class="nm">1.</span><span class="cl">(Rav Masneh):</span> On the day that they were able to bury those killed in Beitar, the Sanhedrin in Yavneh enacted the fourth blessing of Birkas ha'Mazon, 'ha'Tov veha'Metiv'.</p>
<p class="bas indent3"><span class="nm">i.</span>'Ha'Tov' - Hash-m kept the bodies from decaying;</p>
<p class="bas indent3"><span class="nm">ii.</span>'Ha'Metiv' - He enabled that they will be buried.</p>
<p class="bas indent1"><span class="nm">(i)</span><span class="cl">Answer #6 (Rabah and Rav Yosef):</span> This is the day that they cease cutting wood for the fire on the altar (Rashbam - we celebrate completion of a great Mitzvah; R. Gershom - we are no longer Batel from Torah).</p>
<p class="bas indent2"><span class="nm">1.</span><span class="cl">(Beraisa - R. Eliezer ha'Gadol):</span> When the 15th of Av comes, the sun is not so strong, so they stop cutting wood for the altar (lest it be wormy).</p>
<p class="bas indent2"><span class="nm">2.</span><span class="cl">(Rav Menashe):</span> It is called the day of breaking the saw.</p>
<p class="bas indent1"><span class="nm">(j)</span>From this day onwards, (the nights get longer, so) one who increases learning at night will live longer. One who does not do so, Yasif.</p>
<p class="bas indent1"><span class="nm">(k)</span><span class="cl">Question:</span> What does Yasif mean?</p>
<p class="bas indent1"><span class="nm">(l)</span><span class="cl">Answer (Rav Yosef):</span> His mother will bury him (i.e. he will perish).</p>
<p class="bas subject"><span class="nm">3)</span>SEVEN MEN WHO SPANNED THE WORLD</p>
<p class="bas indent1"><span class="nm">(a)</span><span class="cl">(Beraisa):</span> There are seven men whose lives cover all of time, from the creation of man until today: Adam, Mesushelach, Shem, Yakov, Amram, Achiyah ha'Shiloni, and Eliyahu.</p>
<p class="bas indent2"><span class="nm">1.</span><span class="cl">Question:</span> How could Achiyah ha'Shiloni have been born in Amram's lifetime? "V'Lo Nosar Mehem Ish Ki Im Kalev ben Yefuneh vi'Hoshua" (only Yehoshua and Kalev entered Eretz Yisrael among the men who left Mitzrayim)!</p>
<p class="bas indent1"><span class="nm">(b)</span><span class="cl">Answer (Rav Hamnuna):</span> The decree did not include Leviyim. It says "l'Chol Misparchem mi'Ben Esrim Shanah va'Ma'alah";</p>
<p class="bas indent2"><span class="nm">1.</span>This excludes Leviyim, who are counted from 30 days and older.</p>
<p class="bas indent1"><span class="nm">(c)</span><span class="cl">Question:</span> Also men from other tribes who left Mitzrayim entered Eretz Yisrael!</p>
<p class="bas indent2"><span class="nm">1.</span><span class="cl">(Beraisa):</span> Ya'ir ben Menashe and Machir ben Menashe were born in Yakov's lifetime, and they entered Eretz Yisrael.</p>
<p class="bas indent3"><span class="nm">i.</span><span class="cl">(Beraisa - R. Yehudah):</span> "Va'Yaku Mehem Anshei ha'Ai ki'Shloshim v'Shishah Ish" is literally true;</p>
<p class="bas indent3"><span class="nm">ii.</span><span class="cl">R. Nechemyah:</span> It says <i>like</i> 36! (How can the number not be exact?!) Rather, they killed Ya'ir ben Menashe, who is the equal of the majority of a Sanhedrin.</p>
<p class="bas indent1"><span class="nm">(d)</span><span class="cl">Answer (Rav Acha bar Yakov):</span> The decree was only on men between 20 and 60.</p>
<p class="bas indent2"><span class="nm">1.</span>It says "mi'Ben Esrim Shanah va'Ma'alah". We learn a Gezerah Shavah "va'Ma'alah-va'Ma'alah" from Erchin (pledging to Hekdesh a sum based on the age and gender of a particular person).</p>
<p class="bas indent3"><span class="nm">i.</span>Just like there, above 60 is like below 20 (both have a lower Erech than one between 20 and 60), also regarding the decree to die in the Midbar.</p>
