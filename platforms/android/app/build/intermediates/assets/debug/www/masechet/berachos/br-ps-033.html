<p class="bas subject"><span class="nm">1)</span>INTERRUPTING PRAYER</p>
<p class="bas indent1"><span class="nm">(a)</span><span class="cl">(Beraisa):</span> A case occurred, a Chasid was praying on the road; a nobleman came and greeted him, he did not answer. The nobleman waited until he finished praying, and rebuked him:</p>
<p class="bas indent2"><span class="nm">1.</span>Your Torah says, "Rak Hishamer Lecha u'Shemor Nafshecha...; v'Nishmartem Me'od l'Nafshoseichem" -- you should have answered me! Had I killed you, no one would have a claim against me!</p>
<p class="bas indent2"><span class="nm">2.</span><span class="cl">The Chasid:</span> Allow me to appease you! If you were standing in front of the king, and your friend greeted you, would you answer him?</p>
<p class="bas indent2"><span class="nm">3.</span><span class="cl">The nobleman:</span> No.</p>
<p class="bas indent2"><span class="nm">4.</span><span class="cl">The Chasid:</span> If you answered him, what would they do to you?</p>
<p class="bas indent2"><span class="nm">5.</span><span class="cl">The nobleman:</span> They would kill me!</p>
<p class="bas indent2"><span class="nm">6.</span><span class="cl">The Chasid:</span> Make a Kal va'Chomer! If you were standing in front of a mortal king, who is here today and will die tomorrow, you would not interrupt -- I was standing in front of the King of kings, who lives for all eternity, all the more so I should not interrupt!</p>
<p class="bas indent2"><span class="nm">7.</span>The nobleman was appeased.</p>
<p class="bas indent1"><span class="nm">(b)</span><span class="cl">(Mishnah):</span> Even if a snake wraps itself around his heel, he should not interrupt.</p>
<p class="bas indent1"><span class="nm">(c)</span><span class="cl">(Rav Sheshes):</span> This only applies to a snake, but if a scorpion is about to sting him, he should interrupt.</p>
<p class="bas indent1"><span class="nm">(d)</span><span class="cl">Question (Beraisa):</span> If a man fell into a lion's den, we may not testify that he died (to permit his wife to remarry);</p>
<p class="bas indent2"><span class="nm">1.</span>If he fell into a pit of snakes <i>or</i> scorpions, we may testify that he died. (Even snakes definitely kill!)</p>
<p class="bas indent1"><span class="nm">(e)</span><span class="cl">Answer:</span> There it is different, since he fell on them, they will surely kill him.</p>
<p class="bas indent1"><span class="nm">(f)</span><span class="cl">(R. Yitzchak):</span> If one was praying and saw bulls coming towards him, he should interrupt.</p>
<p class="bas indent1"><span class="nm">(g)</span><span class="cl">(R. Oshaya):</span> One should distance himself 50 Amos from a Tam bull, and as far as one can see from a Mu'ad (one that has gored three times in the past).</p>
<p class="bas indent1"><span class="nm">(h)</span><span class="cl">(Beraisa - R. Meir):</span> [Even] if a bull is eating from its trough, go up to the roof and throw down the ladder (i.e. do not go down while it is around (we are not really concerned that it will climb the ladder)).</p>
<p class="bas indent1"><span class="nm">(i)</span><span class="cl">(Shmuel):</span> This applies only to a black bull in Nisan, for then [winter is over, it sees grass all around and becomes bold, and] the Satan dances between its horns (tempts it to gore).</p>
<p class="bas indent1"><span class="nm">(j)</span><span class="cl">(Beraisa):</span> A case occurred in a certain place, an Arod (a crossbreed of serpent and lizard) was damaging people; R. Chanina ben Dosa put his foot over its hole, it bit him and it died. He took it to the Beis Medrash and announced, "See, the Arod does not kill; rather, sin kills!"</p>
<p class="bas indent1"><span class="nm">(k)</span>People said, "Woe to the person who encounters an Arod, woe to the Arod who encounters R. Chanina ben Dosa!"</p>
<p class="bas subject"><span class="nm">2)</span>ADDITIONS TO SHEMONEH ESREH</p>
<p class="bas indent1"><span class="nm">(a)</span><span class="cl">(Mishnah):</span> [In winter] we mention the might of rain in Techiyas ha'Mesim (the second blessing), we request rain in Birkas ha'Shanim.</p>
<p class="bas indent1"><span class="nm">(b)</span>[On Motza'i Shabbos or Motza'i Yom Tov] we say Havdalah in Chonen ha'Da'as;</p>
<p class="bas indent1"><span class="nm">(c)</span>R. Akiva says, it is [a blessing by itself,] the fourth blessing;</p>
<p class="bas indent1"><span class="nm">(d)</span>R. Eliezer says, one says Havdalah in Modim.</p>
<p class="bas indent1"><span class="nm">(e)</span><span class="cl">(Gemara) Question:</span> Why do we mention rain in Techiyas ha'Mesim?</p>
<p class="bas indent1"><span class="nm">(f)</span><span class="cl">Answer (Rav Yosef):</span> Because it is like Techiyas ha'Mesim (it gives life), we mention it in the blessing of Techiyas ha'Mesim.</p>
<p class="bas indent1"><span class="nm">(g)</span><span class="cl">Question:</span> Why do we request rain in Birkas ha'Shanim?</p>
<p class="bas indent1"><span class="nm">(h)</span><span class="cl">Answer (Rav Yosef):</span> Because it is livelihood, we request it in the blessing of livelihood.</p>
<p class="bas indent1"><span class="nm">(i)</span><span class="cl">Question:</span> Why do we say Havdalah in Chonen ha'Da'as?</p>
<p class="bas indent1"><span class="nm">(j)</span><span class="cl">Answer #1 (Rav Yosef):</span> Because it involves wisdom (the ability to differentiate), we say it in the blessing of wisdom.</p>
<p class="bas indent1"><span class="nm">(k)</span><span class="cl">Answer #2 (Rabanan):</span> Because it pertains to [the end of Kodesh and the beginning of] Chol, we say it in the [first] Chol (weekday) blessing.</p>
<p class="bas indent1"><span class="nm">(l)</span><span class="cl">(R. Ami):</span> Understanding is great, for we say it in the [first[ weekday blessing.</p>
<p class="bas indent1"><span class="nm">(m)</span><span class="cl">(R. Ami):</span> Understanding is great, for a verse puts it between two names of Hash-m -- "Ki Kel De'os Hash-m";</p>
<p class="bas indent1"><span class="nm">(n)</span><span class="cl">(R. Elazar):</span> If a person does not have (i.e. does not use his) understanding, it is forbidden to have mercy on him -- "Ki Lo Am Binos Hu Al Ken Lo Yerachamenu."</p>
<p class="bas indent1"><span class="nm">(o)</span><span class="cl">(R. Elazar):</span> The Mikdash is great, it is between two names of Hash-m -- "Pa'alta Hash-m Mikdash Hash-m Konenu Yadecha."</p>
<p class="bas indent1"><span class="nm">(p)</span><span class="cl">(R. Elazar):</span> Any person who has understanding, it is as if the Beis ha'Mikdash was built in his day, since both of these are put between two names of Hash-m.</p>
<p class="bas indent1"><span class="nm">(q)</span><span class="cl">Question (Rav Ada Karchina'ah):</span> If so, you should say that vengeance is great, it is also between two names of Hash-m -- "Kel Nekamos Hash-m"!</p>
<p class="bas indent1"><span class="nm">(r)</span><span class="cl">Answer (R. Elazar):</span> Indeed, it is sometimes great, as Ula taught:</p>
<p class="bas indent2"><span class="nm">1.</span><span class="cl">(Ula):</span> The verse mentions two vengeances -- one was for good, "Hofi'a me'Har Paran" (He took Shechinah from the Nochrim and put it on Yisrael);</p>
<p class="bas indent2"><span class="nm">2.</span>The other was for punishment -- "Kel Nekamos Hash-m Kel Nekamos Hofi'a"!</p>
<p class="bas subject"><span class="nm">3)</span>THE ENACTMENTS OF HAVDALAH</p>
<p class="bas indent1"><span class="nm">(a)</span><span class="cl">(Mishnah - R. Akiva):</span> It is [a blessing by itself,] the fourth blessing.</p>
<p class="bas indent1"><span class="nm">(b)</span><span class="cl">Question (R. Shemen bar Aba):</span> The Anshei Keneses ha'Gedolah established Berachos, Tefilos, Kedushos and Havdalos -- why, then, do Tana'im argue about Havdalah? We should follow what they enacted!</p>
<p class="bas indent1"><span class="nm">(c)</span><span class="cl">Answer (R. Yochanan):</span> At first, Bnei Yisrael (those who returned with Ezra) were poor, they enacted to say Havdalah in Shemoneh Esreh; later, they became richer, they enacted to say it over of wine;</p>
<p class="bas indent2"><span class="nm">1.</span>They became poor again, they enacted to say it in Shemoneh Esreh again, but one [who is able to] should say it again over wine.</p>
<p class="bas indent1"><span class="nm">(d)</span><span class="cl">(Rabah and Rav Yosef):</span> [Even] one who says Havdalah in Shemoneh Esreh should say it again over wine.</p>
<p class="bas indent1"><span class="nm">(e)</span><span class="cl">Question (Rabah against himself - Beraisa):</span> If [in winter] one mistakenly omitted mention of rain in Techiyas ha'Mesim or the request for rain in Birkas ha'Shanim, he must go back and say them;</p>
<p class="bas indent2"><span class="nm">1.</span>If he mistakenly omitted Havdalah in Chonen ha'Da'as, he does not go back, for he <i>can</i> say it later over wine.</p>
<p class="bas indent2"><span class="nm">2.</span>(Rabah holds that in any case one must say Havdalah over wine!)</p>
<p class="bas indent1"><span class="nm">(f)</span><span class="cl">Answer:</span> It means, he does not go back, for he <i>will</i> say it later over wine.</p>
<p class="bas indent1"><span class="nm">(g)</span><span class="cl">(R. Binyamin bar Yefes):</span> R. Yosi asked if one who says Havdalah in Shemoneh Esreh must say it again over wine; R. Yochanan said that he must.</p>
<p class="bas indent1"><span class="nm">(h)</span><span class="cl">Question:</span> If one said Havdalah over wine, must he say it again in Shemoneh Esreh?</p>
<p class="bas indent1"><span class="nm">(i)</span><span class="cl">Answer (Rav Nachman bar Yitzchak):</span> A Kal va'Chomer teaches that he must!</p>
<p class="bas indent2"><span class="nm">1.</span>The primary enactment was to say Havdalah in Shemoneh Esreh, yet one who says Havdalah in Shemoneh Esreh must still say it again over wine; all the more so, one who says it over wine must fulfill the primary enactment to say it in Shemoneh Esreh!</p>
<p class="bas indent1"><span class="nm">(j)</span><span class="cl">(Rav Acha Aricha - Beraisa):</span> One who says Havdalah in Shemoneh Esreh is more praiseworthy than one who says it over wine; if he says both of them, blessings will rest on his head!</p>
<p class="bas indent1"><span class="nm">(k)</span><span class="cl">Question:</span> The Beraisa contradicts itself!</p>
<p class="bas indent2"><span class="nm">1.</span>First it says that one who says Havdalah in Shemoneh Esreh is more praiseworthy than one who says it again over wine -- implying that it suffices to say it in Shemoneh Esreh;</p>
<p class="bas indent2"><span class="nm">2.</span>Then it says that if he says both of them, blessings will rest on his head -- since he already fulfilled his obligation, saying it again is an unnecessary blessing!</p>
<p class="bas indent2"><span class="nm">3.</span><span class="cl">(Rav):</span> Anyone who says an unnecessary blessing transgresses "Lo Sisa [Es Shem Hash-m Elokecha la'Shav]."</p>
<p class="bas indent1"><span class="nm">(l)</span><span class="cl">Correction:</span> It should say, "If he was Mavdil in Shemoneh Esreh and <i>not</i> over wine, blessings will rest on his head."</p>
<p class="bas indent1"><span class="nm">(m)</span><span class="cl">Question (Rav Chisda):</span> If he forgot to say Havdalah in Shemoneh Esreh and over wine (Rashba - before eating or doing Melachah), what is the law?</p>
<p class="bas indent1"><span class="nm">(n)</span><span class="cl">Answer (Rav Sheshes):</span> He must pray again and say Havdalah over wine (as a penalty).</p>
<p class="bas bbbline">33b----------------------------------------33b</p>
<p class="bas indent1"><span class="nm">(o)</span><span class="cl">Question (Ravina):</span> What is the Halachah?</p>
<p class="bas indent1"><span class="nm">(p)</span><span class="cl">Answer (Rava):</span> It is like Kidush -- just as one says it in Shemoneh Esreh, he also says it over wine; the same applies to Havdalah.</p>
<p class="bas subject"><span class="nm">4)</span>WHERE TO SAY HAVDALAH</p>
<p class="bas indent1"><span class="nm">(a)</span><span class="cl">(Mishnah - R. Eliezer):</span> One says Havdalah in the blessing of Modim.</p>
<p class="bas indent1"><span class="nm">(b)</span><span class="cl">R. Zeira (to R. Chiya bar Avin):</span> Did you say in the name of R. Yochanan that the Halachah is like R. Eliezer when Yom Tov is after Shabbos?</p>
<p class="bas indent1"><span class="nm">(c)</span><span class="cl">R. Chiya:</span> Yes.</p>
<p class="bas indent1"><span class="nm">(d)</span><span class="cl">R. Zeira:</span> Saying that the Halachah follows him implies that there is an argument about it (but there is no argument)!</p>
<p class="bas indent2"><span class="nm">1.</span><span class="cl">Objection:</span> Chachamim explicitly argue in the Mishnah!</p>
<p class="bas indent2"><span class="nm">2.</span><span class="cl">Answer:</span> They argue about a regular Motza'i Shabbos (when we say the blessing of Chonen ha'Da'as), not when Motza'i Shabbos is Yom Tov!</p>
<p class="bas indent2"><span class="nm">3.</span><span class="cl">Question:</span> R. Akiva argues (and says that it is a blessing by itself, surely the same applies on Yom Tov)!</p>
<p class="bas indent2"><span class="nm">4.</span><span class="cl">Answer:</span> The Halachah does not follow R. Akiva (on a regular Motza'i Shabbos), why should it follow him on Yom Tov?!</p>
<p class="bas indent3"><span class="nm">i.</span>The Halachah is unlike R. Akiva (on a regular Motza'i Shabbos) because the Anshei Keneses ha'Gedolah enacted 18 Berachos, not 19 -- likewise, they enacted seven Berachos on Yom Tov, not eight!</p>
<p class="bas indent1"><span class="nm">(e)</span><span class="cl">Version #1 (our text) R. Chiya bar Avin:</span> [Regarding the Halachah, I do not hold like R. Yochanan who says that the Halachah <i>follows</i> R. Eliezer, rather,] we are <i>inclined</i> to follow R. Eliezer:</p>
<p class="bas indent1"><span class="nm">(f)</span>(Devar Shmuel (cited by Gilyon ha'Shas) - R. Chiya never answered R. Zeira's objection; he relies on Rav, who surely holds that they argue.)</p>
<p class="bas indent1"><span class="nm">(g)</span><span class="cl">Version #2 - R. Zeira:</span> R. Yochanan did not say that the Halachah follows R. Eliezer, rather, Chachamim agree with R. Eliezer. (End of Version #2)</p>
<p class="bas indent2"><span class="nm">1.</span><span class="cl">Version A (R. Yitzchak bar Avodimi citing Rav):</span> The Halachah follows R. Eliezer.</p>
<p class="bas indent2"><span class="nm">2.</span><span class="cl">Version B (R. Yitzchak bar Avodimi citing Rav):</span> We are inclined to follow R. Eliezer. (End of Version B)</p>
<p class="bas indent2"><span class="nm">3.</span><span class="cl">(R. Yochanan):</span> Chachamim agree with R. Eliezer (when Motza'i Shabbos is Yom Tov).</p>
<p class="bas indent2"><span class="nm">4.</span><span class="cl">(R. Chiya bar <i>Aba</i>):</span> R. Eliezer's opinion appears to be correct (in this case).</p>
<p class="bas indent1"><span class="nm">(h)</span><span class="cl">R. Zeira:</span> One should rely on R. Chiya bar Aba, for he is as careful about what he learns (from R. Yochanan) as Rachbah of Pumbedisa:</p>
<p class="bas indent2"><span class="nm">1.</span><span class="cl">(Rachbah citing Rav Yehudah):</span> Har ha'Bayis was surrounded by a double Stav (ledges to sit on), one inside the other. (He used the same word (Stav) that his Rebbi did, even though the Mishnayos use a different word.)</p>
<p class="bas indent1"><span class="nm">(i)</span><span class="cl">(Rav Yosef):</span> I do not rely on any of the above opinions, rather, on the beautiful text that Rav and Shmuel enacted in Bavel (that puts Havdalah in Kedushas ha'Yom when Motza'i Shabbos is Yom Tov):</p>
<p class="bas indent2"><span class="nm">1.</span>"Hash-m, You made known to us your laws... You bequeathed to us times of joy... You distinguished between the Kedushos of Shabbos and Yom Tov... Give us... [times of Simchah]..."</p>
<p class="bas subject"><span class="nm">5)</span>IMPROPER PRAYERS</p>
<p class="bas indent1"><span class="nm">(a)</span><span class="cl">(Mishnah):</span> If one says, "Your mercy is even upon a bird's nest (therefore, You commanded us to send away the mother before taking her young)," or, "Your name will be mentioned for good [deeds that You do]," or, "Modim Modim (we thank You, we thank You)," we silence him.</p>
<p class="bas indent1"><span class="nm">(b)</span><span class="cl">(Gemara) Question:</span> We understand why we silence one who says, "Modim Modim," for it sounds like he prays to two powers;</p>
<p class="bas indent2"><span class="nm">1.</span>We also understand why we silence one who says, "Your name will be mentioned for good," for this implies that we do not bless over misfortune (but this is wrong)!</p>
<p class="bas indent3"><span class="nm">i.</span><span class="cl">(Mishnah):</span> One must bless over misfortune just as one blesses over the good.</p>
<p class="bas indent2"><span class="nm">2.</span>But why do we silence one who says, "Your mercy is upon a bird's nest"?</p>
<p class="bas indent1"><span class="nm">(c)</span><span class="cl">Answer #1 (R. Yosi bar Avin or R. Yosi bar Zvida):</span> This arouses jealousy among the creations;</p>
<p class="bas indent1"><span class="nm">(d)</span><span class="cl">Answer #2 (The other of R. Yosi bar Avin and R. Yosi bar Zvida):</span> He says that the Mitzvos are because of Hash-m's mercy -- this is wrong, they are decrees (to publicize that Yisrael are His servants).</p>
<p class="bas indent1"><span class="nm">(e)</span>A man came in front of Rabah and said, "You (Hash-m) had mercy on a bird's nest, may You have mercy on us!"</p>
<p class="bas indent2"><span class="nm">1.</span><span class="cl">Rabah:</span> He really knows how to appease his Master!</p>
<p class="bas indent2"><span class="nm">2.</span><span class="cl">Abaye:</span> But the Mishnah says that we silence him!</p>
<p class="bas indent2"><span class="nm">3.</span>Rabah knew this, he was just testing Abaye.</p>
<p class="bas indent1"><span class="nm">(f)</span>A man came in front of R. Chanina and said, "ha'Kel ha'Gadol ha'Gibor veha'Nora veha'Adir..."</p>
<p class="bas indent1"><span class="nm">(g)</span><span class="cl">R. Chanina (after the man finished):</span> Have you exhausted the praises of your Master?!</p>
<p class="bas indent2"><span class="nm">1.</span>Why did you say so many -- we may say [the first] three only because they are written in the Torah, and the Anshei Keneses ha'Gedolah enacted to say them in Shemoneh Esreh!</p>
<p class="bas indent2"><span class="nm">2.</span>This is like a mortal king who had millions of gold coins, and someone was praising him for having silver -- this is a insult to him!</p>
<p class="bas indent1"><span class="nm">(h)</span><span class="cl">(R. Chanina):</span> Everything is in the hands of Shamayim, except for Yir'as Shamayim -- "v'Atah Mah Hash-m Elokecha Sho'el me'Imach Ki Im l'Yir'ah."</p>
<p class="bas indent1"><span class="nm">(i)</span><span class="cl">Question:</span> Is Yir'as Shamayim such a small matter?!</p>
<p class="bas indent2"><span class="nm">1.</span><span class="cl">(R. Chanina):</span> Hash-m's treasure-house contains only Yir'as Shamayim -- "Yir'as Shamayim Hi Otzaro" (it is most dear to Hash-m)!</p>
<p class="bas indent1"><span class="nm">(j)</span><span class="cl">Answer:</span> Indeed, for Moshe it was a simple matter. (Maharsha - the simple Yir'as Shamayim, fear of punishment, is indeed easy -- but R. Chanina did not discuss this, for it is bi'Yedei Shamayim (Hash-m punishes others to instill fear in Bnei Yisrael)! Rather, he discusses an intellectual awe of His greatness; for those who saw the radiance of Moshe and feared to approach him, it was simple to similarly fear Hash-m.)</p>
<p class="bas indent1"><span class="nm">(k)</span><span class="cl">R. Chanina:</span> This is like one who is asked for a large vessel -- if he has it, it is like a small vessel;</p>
<p class="bas indent2"><span class="nm">1.</span>If one is asked for a small vessel and he lacks it, it is like a big vessel (he feels his lack acutely).</p>
<p class="bas indent1"><span class="nm">(l)</span><span class="cl">(Mishnah):</span> If one says, "Modim Modim," we silence him.</p>
<p class="bas indent1"><span class="nm">(m)</span><span class="cl">(R. Zeira):</span> Saying "Shema Shema" is like saying "Modim Modim."</p>
<p class="bas indent1"><span class="nm">(n)</span><span class="cl">Question (Beraisa):</span> Saying Shema and repeating it is detestable.</p>
<p class="bas indent2"><span class="nm">1.</span><span class="cl">Inference:</span> It is detestable, we do not silence him!</p>
<p class="bas indent1"><span class="nm">(o)</span><span class="cl">Answer:</span> If he says each word and repeats it, it is only detestable; if he says the entire verse and repeats it, we silence him.</p>
<p class="bas indent1"><span class="nm">(p)</span><span class="cl">Question (Rav Papa):</span> Perhaps he did not have proper intent the first time, and he repeats it with proper intent (why is this detestable)?!</p>
<p class="bas indent1"><span class="nm">(q)</span><span class="cl">Answer (Abaye):</span> Is he a peer of Hash-m (that he speaks to Him without intent)?! If one normally does so, we hit him with a hammer until he says it with intent!</p>
