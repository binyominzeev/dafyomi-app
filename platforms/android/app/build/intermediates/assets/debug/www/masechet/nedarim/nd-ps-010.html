<p class="dedicationbox"><br>12TH CYCLE DEDICATION<br>NEDARIM 7-10 - Two weeks of study material have been dedicated by Mrs. Estanne Abraham Fawer to honor the eighth Yahrzeit of her father, Rav Mordechai ben Eliezer Zvi (Rabbi Morton Weiner) Z'L, who passed away on 18 Teves 5760. May the merit of supporting and advancing Dafyomi study -- which was so important to him -- during the weeks of his Yahrzeit serve as an Iluy for his Neshamah. </p>

<p class="bas subject"><span class="nm">1)</span>NEDARIM AND NEDAVOS OF TZADIKIM</p>
<p class="bas indent1"><span class="nm">(a)</span><span class="cl">Answer #2 (to Question 2:b, Daf 9a):</span> Our Mishnah is like R. Yehudah. He meant that a Nedavah that is fulfilled is better than not vowing at all. He did not say so about a Neder.</p>
<p class="bas indent1"><span class="nm">(b)</span><span class="cl">Question (Beraisa - R. Yehudah):</span> Better than both of these, is to be Noder and fulfill it.</p>
<p class="bas indent1"><span class="nm">(c)</span><span class="cl">Answer:</span> It should say "better... is to be Nodev and fulfill it."</p>
<p class="bas indent1"><span class="nm">(d)</span><span class="cl">Question:</span> Surely, it is better not to take a Neder lest one transgress it. The same concern applies to Nedavos!</p>
<p class="bas indent1"><span class="nm">(e)</span><span class="cl">Answer:</span> R. Yehudah holds that one brings his animal to the Mikdash, makes it Hekdesh and immediately offers it (so there is no concern lest one benefit from it).</p>
<p class="bas indent1"><span class="nm">(f)</span><span class="cl">Question:</span> This answers for Nedavos of Korbanos. How can we explain Nedavos of Nezirus?</p>
<p class="bas indent1"><span class="nm">(g)</span><span class="cl">Answer (Beraisa - R. Yehudah):</span> Early Chasidim yearned to be able to bring a Chatas, since (they never needed to bring one due to sin, for) Hash-m does not bring mishaps through them. They would accept a Nedavah of Nezirus, in order to bring a Chatas (at the end of Nezirus);</p>
<p class="bas indent2"><span class="nm">1.</span>R. Shimon says, they did not become Nezirim. One may bring Olah, Shelamim or Todah and its four types of bread for Nedavah, but not Nezirus, for a Nazir is called a sinner - "me'Asher Chata Al ha'Nefesh."</p>
<p class="bas indent1"><span class="nm">(h)</span><span class="cl">(Abaye):</span> Shimon ha'Tzadik, R. Shimon and R. Elazar ha'Kafar b'Ribi all hold similarly, that a Nazir is a sinner. We already taught about Shimon ha'Tzadik (he considered only one Nazir to be a proper Nazir la'Shem) and R. Shimon. The following teaches about R. Elazar ha'Kafar:</p>
<p class="bas indent2"><span class="nm">1.</span><span class="cl">(Beraisa - R. Elazar ha'Kafar) Question:</span> "Me'Asher Chata Al ha'Nefesh" - against whom did the Nazir sin?</p>
<p class="bas indent2"><span class="nm">2.</span><span class="cl">Answer:</span> He sinned against himself, by denying himself wine. If one who denies himself one matter is called a sinner, all the more so, one who fasts and denies himself everything!</p>
<p class="bas indent1"><span class="nm">(i)</span><span class="cl">Question:</span> "Me'Asher Chata Al ha'Nefesh" is written regarding a Nazir Tamei! (His sin was becoming Tamei!)</p>
<p class="bas indent1"><span class="nm">(j)</span><span class="cl">Answer:</span> (It applies to all Nezirim.) It was written regarding a Nazir Tamei because he sinned twice (denying himself wine, and becoming Tamei. Alternatively, he must begin Nezirus anew and pain himself again.)</p>
<p class="bas subject"><span class="nm">2)</span>KINUYIM</p>
<p class="bas indent1"><span class="nm">(a)</span><span class="cl">(Mishnah):</span> The following are Kinuyim (substitute words) for Korban. Konam, Konach, and Konas;</p>
<p class="bas indent1"><span class="nm">(b)</span>Cherek, Cherech, Cheref are Kinuyim for Cherem.</p>
<p class="bas indent1"><span class="nm">(c)</span>Nazik, Nazi'ach, and Pazi'ach are Kinuyim for Nezirus.</p>
<p class="bas indent1"><span class="nm">(d)</span>Shevusah, Shekukah, or vowing 'b'Mohi' are Kinuyim for Shevu'ah.</p>
<p class="bas indent1"><span class="nm">(e)</span><span class="cl">(Gemara - R. Yochanan):</span> Kinuyim are (translations of Korban or Cherem...) from Nochri languages;</p>
<p class="bas indent1"><span class="nm">(f)</span><span class="cl">(Reish Lakish):</span> Chachamim concocted them for people to use when vowing.</p>
<p class="bas indent1"><span class="nm">(g)</span><span class="cl">Question:</span> Why did they concoct them?</p>
<p class="bas indent1"><span class="nm">(h)</span><span class="cl">Answer:</span> They did not want people to say "Korban".'</p>
<p class="bas indent1"><span class="nm">(i)</span><span class="cl">Question:</span> What is wrong with saying "Korban"?</p>
<p class="bas indent1"><span class="nm">(j)</span><span class="cl">Answer:</span> One might come to say "Korban la'Shem."</p>
<p class="bas indent1"><span class="nm">(k)</span><span class="cl">Question:</span> What's wrong with saying that?</p>
<p class="bas indent1"><span class="nm">(l)</span><span class="cl">Answer:</span> Perhaps he will say only "la'Shem" without "Korban," and his mention of Hash-m's Name was in vain:</p>
<p class="bas bbbline">10b----------------------------------------10b</p>
<p class="bas indent2"><span class="nm">1.</span><span class="cl">(Beraisa - R. Shimon) Question:</span> What is the source that one shouldn't say "la'Shem Olah", or "(la'Shem) Minchah", "Todah" or "Shelamim"?</p>
<p class="bas indent2"><span class="nm">2.</span><span class="cl">Answer:</span> It says "Korban la'Shem".</p>
<p class="bas indent3"><span class="nm">i.</span>The Torah was particular about one who says Hash-m's Name to be Makdish a Korban (to guard against saying His Name in vain). All the more so, one may not intentionally say it in vain!</p>
<p class="bas indent1"><span class="nm">(m)</span><span class="cl">Suggestion:</span> R. Yochanan and Reish Lakish argue like the following Tana'im:</p>
<p class="bas indent2"><span class="nm">1.</span><span class="cl">(Beraisa - Beis Shamai):</span> Kinuyim of Kinuyim are binding.</p>
<p class="bas indent2"><span class="nm">2.</span>Beis Hillel say, they are not binding.</p>
<p class="bas indent2"><span class="nm">3.</span><span class="cl">Suggestion:</span> Beis Shamai hold that they are from Nochri languages (and also Kinuyei Kinuyim are used to denote Korban or Cherem...) Beis Hillel hold that Chachamim concocted Kinuyim, but not Kinuyei Kinuyim.</p>
<p class="bas indent1"><span class="nm">(n)</span><span class="cl">Rejection #1:</span> All agree that Kinuyim are from Nochri languages. Beis Shamai hold that Nochrim also use Kinuyei Kinuyim, and Beis Hillel hold that they do not.</p>
<p class="bas indent1"><span class="nm">(o)</span><span class="cl">Rejection #2:</span> They argue about whether or not we decree to forbid one who vowed with Kinuy Kinuyim.</p>
<p class="bas subject"><span class="nm">3)</span>EXAMPLES OF <i>KINUYEI</i> <i>KINUYIM</i></p>
<p class="bas indent1"><span class="nm">(a)</span><span class="cl">Question:</span> What are Kinuyei Kinuyim of Nedarim?</p>
<p class="bas indent1"><span class="nm">(b)</span><span class="cl">Answer (Rav Yosef - Beraisa):</span> Mekanmena, Mekanchana and Mekansana are Kinuyei Kinuyim (for Korban).</p>
<p class="bas indent1"><span class="nm">(c)</span><span class="cl">(Mafsha'ah - Beraisa):</span> Charakim, Charachim and Charafim are Kinuyei Kinuyim for Cherem.</p>
<p class="bas indent1"><span class="nm">(d)</span><span class="cl">(Rav Yosef - Beraisa):</span> Mechazkana, Menazchana and Mafichna are Kinuyei Kinuyim for Nezirus.</p>
<p class="bas indent1"><span class="nm">(e)</span><span class="cl">Question:</span> Are Mifchazna, Mischazna, and Misazna Kinuyei Kinuyim?</p>
<p class="bas indent1"><span class="nm">(f)</span><span class="cl">Question (Ravina):</span> If one said 'Kinma', does he refer to Konam, or to Kinman Besem (cinnamon)?</p>
<p class="bas indent1"><span class="nm">(g)</span><span class="cl">Question (Rav Acha brei d'Rav Chiya):</span> If one said 'Kinah', does this refer to a chickens' nest, or to Konam?</p>
<p class="bas indent1"><span class="nm">(h)</span>These questions are not resolved.</p>
<p class="bas indent1"><span class="nm">(i)</span><span class="cl">Question:</span> What are Kinuyei Kinuyim of Shevu'ah?</p>
<p class="bas indent1"><span class="nm">(j)</span><span class="cl">Answer:</span> They are Shevuel, Shevusiel, and Shekukel.</p>
<p class="bas indent1"><span class="nm">(k)</span><span class="cl">Objection:</span> Shevuel is a name, of the son of Gershsom (Divrei ha'Yamim 1:23:16)!</p>
<p class="bas indent1"><span class="nm">(l)</span><span class="cl">Answer:</span> Rather, 'Shevuva'el' is a Kinuy Kinuy.</p>
<p class="bas indent1"><span class="nm">(m)</span><span class="cl">(Shmuel):</span> If one said 'Ashivta', 'Ashkika', or 'Karinsha', it has no effect.</p>
<p class="bas subject"><span class="nm">4)</span>VOWING <i>B'MOHI</i></p>
<p class="bas indent1"><span class="nm">(a)</span><span class="cl">(Mishnah):</span> Vowing 'b'Mohi' is a Kinuy for Shevu'ah.</p>
<p class="bas indent1"><span class="nm">(b)</span>(Beraisa - R. Shimon ben Gamliel) If one said (only) "b'Mohi" (a nickname for Moshe), it has no effect;</p>
<p class="bas indent1"><span class="nm">(c)</span>If he said "the Mumsa (oath) of Mohi", it is a Kinuy for a Shevu'ah. (Our Mishnah discusses this.)</p>
<p class="bas subject"><span class="nm">5)</span>SAYING THAT SOMETHING IS LIKE <i>CHOL</i> OR LIKE <i>KODESH</i></p>
<p class="bas indent1"><span class="nm">(a)</span><span class="cl">(Mishnah):</span> The following forbid: if one said 'l'Chulin (is) what I will eat from you', or 'not Kosher', 'not Tahor', 'Tahor', 'Tamei', 'Nosar', or 'Pigul';</p>
<p class="bas indent1"><span class="nm">(b)</span>The following forbid like a Korban - if one said 'like Imra (a lamb)', 'like pens (of animals)', 'like wood', 'like (things that go on the) fires', 'like the Mizbe'ach', 'like the Heichal', or 'like Yerushalayim';</p>
<p class="bas indent1"><span class="nm">(c)</span>R. Yehudah says, saying 'Yerushalayim' does not forbid at all.</p>
