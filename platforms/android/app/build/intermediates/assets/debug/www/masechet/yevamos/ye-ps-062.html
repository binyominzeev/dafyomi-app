<p class="bas indent1"><span class="nm">(a)</span><span class="cl">Question:</span> Why don't Beis Hillel learn from Moshe?</p>
<p class="bas indent1"><span class="nm">(b)</span><span class="cl">Answer:</span> Moshe himself decided to cease having children.</p>
<p class="bas indent2"><span class="nm">1.</span><span class="cl">(Beraisa):</span> Moshe made three decisions on his own, and Hash-m agreed with him: he separated from his wife, he broke the Luchos, and he added a day (to the days of preparation for Matan Torah).</p>
<p class="bas indent1"><span class="nm">(c)</span><span class="cl">Question:</span> Why did he separate from his wife?</p>
<p class="bas indent1"><span class="nm">(d)</span><span class="cl">Answer:</span> He made a Kal va'Chomer. Yisrael spoke with Hash-m once, and they were commanded to refrain from Bi'ah beforehand. Hash-m speaks with me at all times, all the more so I should refrain!</p>
<p class="bas indent2"><span class="nm">1.</span>Hash-m agreed to this - "Tell them to return to their tents, and you (Moshe) remain here with Me".</p>
<p class="bas indent1"><span class="nm">(e)</span><span class="cl">Question:</span> Why did he break the Luchos?</p>
<p class="bas indent1"><span class="nm">(f)</span><span class="cl">Answer:</span> He made a Kal va'Chomer. Korban Pesach is one of 613 Mitzvos, and "Any apostate may not eat from it". All the more so, the entire Torah may not be given to Yisrael, who are serving idolatry!</p>
<p class="bas indent1"><span class="nm">(g)</span>Hash-m agreed to this;</p>
<p class="bas indent2"><span class="nm">1.</span><span class="cl">(Reish Lakish):</span> "ASHeR Shibarta" - YiSHaR Kochacha (you should be strengthened) for breaking them.</p>
<p class="bas indent1"><span class="nm">(h)</span><span class="cl">Question:</span> Why did Moshe add a day to the preparation for Matan Torah?</p>
<p class="bas indent1"><span class="nm">(i)</span><span class="cl">Answer:</span> He expounded - "Sanctify today and tomorrow" - today should be like tomorrow;</p>
<p class="bas indent2"><span class="nm">1.</span>Just like tomorrow is a full day of separation including the night, also today (the first day of separation) includes the night. Since the night had already passed when Hash-m said this (Yom Revi'i), "today" (the first day of separation) must refer to Yom Chamishi.</p>
<p class="bas indent1"><span class="nm">(j)</span>Hash-m agreed to this. He did not put His presence on Mount Sinai until Shabbos.</p>
<p class="bas subject"><span class="nm">2)</span>THE <i>MITZVAH</i> OF HAVING CHILDREN</p>
<p class="bas indent1"><span class="nm">(a)</span><span class="cl">(Beraisa #1 - R. Noson):</span> Beis Shamai say that one must have two sons and two daughters. Beis Hillel require one of each.</p>
<p class="bas indent1"><span class="nm">(b)</span><span class="cl">(Rav Huna):</span> According to R. Noson, Beis Shamai learn from "Va'Tosef Laledes Es Achiv Es Hevel" (each "Es" alludes to a sister) - Hevel and his sister and Kayin and his sister;</p>
<p class="bas indent2"><span class="nm">1.</span>It says "Hash-m gave to me other seed in place of Hevel" (to fulfill the obligation).</p>
<p class="bas indent2"><span class="nm">2.</span>Chachamim say that Adam merely thanked Hash-m.</p>
<p class="bas indent1"><span class="nm">(c)</span><span class="cl">(Beraisa #2 - R. Noson):</span> Beis Shamai require one male and one female. Beis Hillel require a male or a female.</p>
<p class="bas indent1"><span class="nm">(d)</span><span class="cl">(Rava):</span> According to R. Noson, Beis Hillel learn from "Lo Sohu Vera'ah Lasheves Yetzarah" - one child fulfills Sheves (populates the world).</p>
<p class="bas indent1"><span class="nm">(e)</span><span class="cl">(R. Yochanan):</span> If a Nochri had children and then converted, he fulfilled Peru u'Rvu (the Mitzvah to have children);</p>
<p class="bas indent1"><span class="nm">(f)</span>Reish Lakish says, he has not fulfilled it.</p>
<p class="bas indent2"><span class="nm">1.</span>R. Yochanan says that he fulfilled Peru u'Rvu because he had children;</p>
<p class="bas indent2"><span class="nm">2.</span>Reish Lakish says that he did not fulfill it, because a convert is like a newborn.</p>
<p class="bas indent1"><span class="nm">(g)</span>They argued similarly elsewhere:</p>
<p class="bas indent2"><span class="nm">1.</span><span class="cl">(R. Yochanan):</span> If a Nochri had children and then converted, his first son born after conversion is not considered a Bechor, for he has previous sons;</p>
<p class="bas indent2"><span class="nm">2.</span>Reish Lakish says, he is a Bechor, since a firstborn Nochri has no special law of inheritance.</p>
<p class="bas indent1"><span class="nm">(h)</span>It was necessary for R. Yochanan and Reish Lakish to argue in both cases.</p>
<p class="bas indent2"><span class="nm">1.</span>Had they argued only in the first case, one might have thought that R. Yochanan argues only there, because Piryah v'Rivyah also applies to Nochrim, but regarding inheritance, he would admit to Reish Lakish;</p>
<p class="bas indent2"><span class="nm">2.</span>Had they argued only in the second case, one would say that Reish Lakish argues only there, but regarding Piryah v'Rivyah, he would admit to R. Yochanan.</p>
<p class="bas indent1"><span class="nm">(i)</span><span class="cl">Question (R. Yochanan):</span> "Bradach Bladan ben Bladan..." (this shows that they have lineage)!</p>
<p class="bas indent1"><span class="nm">(j)</span><span class="cl">Answer (Reish Lakish):</span> While they are Nochrim they have lineage. When they convert, they lose it.</p>
<p class="bas indent1"><span class="nm">(k)</span><span class="cl">(Rav):</span> All agree that a slave has no lineage. "Shevu Lachem Po Im ha'Chamor" - ("Im" connotes equality, and it can be read 'Am', suggesting) a nation similar to a donkey. (This verse was said to Eliezer (a slave) and Yishmael, the son of a Shifchah.)</p>
<p class="bas indent1"><span class="nm">(l)</span><span class="cl">Question:</span> "To Tziva (the slave of Mefivoshes) were 15 <i>Banim</i> and 20 slaves".</p>
<p class="bas indent1"><span class="nm">(m)</span><span class="cl">Answer (Rav Acha bar Yakov):</span> This does not connote lineage any more than "Par Ben Bakar" (a bull born to cattle).</p>
<p class="bas indent1"><span class="nm">(n)</span><span class="cl">Question:</span> If so, the same applies to Nochrim!</p>
<p class="bas indent1"><span class="nm">(o)</span><span class="cl">Answer #1:</span> Regarding Nochrim, it specifies the names of the son and the father. Regarding slaves, it does not.</p>
<p class="bas indent1"><span class="nm">(p)</span><span class="cl">Answer #2:</span> Elsewhere, a Nochri is traced to his father and grandfather - "Ben Hadad ben Tavrimum ben Chaziyon."</p>
<p class="bas subject"><span class="nm">3)</span>WHICH DESCENDANTS COUNT FOR THE <i>MITZVAH</i></p>
<p class="bas indent1"><span class="nm">(a)</span><span class="cl">(Rav Huna):</span> If a man had children and they died, he fulfilled Peru u'Rvu;</p>
<p class="bas indent1"><span class="nm">(b)</span>R. Yochanan says, he did not.</p>
<p class="bas indent1"><span class="nm">(c)</span>Rav Huna holds like Rav Asi:</p>
<p class="bas indent2"><span class="nm">1.</span><span class="cl">(Rav Asi):</span> "Ki Ru'ach mi'Lefanai Ya'atof  (souls in front of Me delay)" - (Mashi'ach) the son of David will not come until all Neshamos in 'Guf' (a treasury) are completed.</p>
<p class="bas indent1"><span class="nm">(d)</span>R. Yochanan says that he was not Yotzei, for he did not fulfil "Lasheves Yetzarah" (he did not help populate the world).</p>
<p class="bas bbbline">62b----------------------------------------62b</p>
<p class="bas indent1"><span class="nm">(e)</span><span class="cl">Question (Beraisa):</span> Grandchildren are like children (a living grandchild substitutes in place of his deceased parent).</p>
<p class="bas indent1"><span class="nm">(f)</span><span class="cl">Answer:</span> No. No substitute is needed for a deceased child. The Beraisa teaches that grandchildren join with children to fulfill the required number of boys and girls.</p>
<p class="bas indent1"><span class="nm">(g)</span><span class="cl">Question (Beraisa):</span> Grandchildren are like children. If a child died, or was found to be a Seris, his father did not fulfill Peru u'Rvu.</p>
<p class="bas indent1"><span class="nm">(h)</span>This refutes Rav Huna.</p>
<p class="bas indent1"><span class="nm">(i)</span><span class="cl">(Beraisa):</span> Grandchildren are like children.</p>
<p class="bas indent1"><span class="nm">(j)</span><span class="cl">(Abaye):</span> This refers to a son of a son, or a daughter of a daughter, and all the more so a son of a daughter (if the grandchild is alive, it is as if his parent is alive), but not a daughter of a son.</p>
<p class="bas indent1"><span class="nm">(k)</span><span class="cl">Objection (Rava):</span> Also a daughter of a son fulfils "Lasheves Yetzarah"!</p>
<p class="bas indent1"><span class="nm">(l)</span>Both agree that we cannot count two grandchildren from one child (if the other child died without children).</p>
<p class="bas indent1"><span class="nm">(m)</span><span class="cl">Question:</span> This is not so! Rabanan told Rav Sheshes to remarry and have children, and he answered, 'The sons of my daughter are (like) sons'!</p>
<p class="bas indent1"><span class="nm">(n)</span><span class="cl">Answer:</span> He rejected them (with a false answer. He didn't remarry because) he became sterile from Rav Huna's class (it was very long, and Rav Sheshes did not leave to urinate when he needed to.)</p>
<p class="bas indent1"><span class="nm">(o)</span><span class="cl">Question (Rabah):</span> What is the source that grandchildren are like children? (Rashi - he asks about sons of daughters. It is clear that sons of sons are like sons.)</p>
<p class="bas indent2"><span class="nm">1.</span><span class="cl">Suggestion:</span> We learn from "The daughters are my daughters, the sons are my sons".</p>
<p class="bas indent2"><span class="nm">2.</span><span class="cl">Rejection - Question:</span> How will we explain "The flock is my flock"? (They are not considered Lavan's children!)</p>
<p class="bas indent3"><span class="nm">i.</span><span class="cl">Answer:</span> Rather, it "is my flock", i.e. that you acquired from me. Similarly, 'they are my children', i.e. that you acquired from me!</p>
<p class="bas indent1"><span class="nm">(p)</span><span class="cl">Answer:</span> Rather, we learn from "Chetzron fathered Seguv from Machir's daughter", "Rulers came from Machir" and "Yehudah is my ruler". (Even though the paternal lineage of all rulers is from Yehudah, some are attributed to Machir, because his daughter's son is like his son.)</p>
<p class="bas subject"><span class="nm">4)</span>SHOULD ONE REMARRY IN HIS OLD AGE?</p>
<p class="bas indent1"><span class="nm">(a)</span>Our Mishnah is unlike R. Yehoshua.</p>
<p class="bas indent2"><span class="nm">1.</span><span class="cl">(Beraisa - R. Yehoshua):</span> If a man married in his youth, he should marry in his old age. If he had children in his youth, he should have children in his old age - "Seed your seed in the morning, and do not withhold in the evening, for you do not know which will be better."</p>
<p class="bas indent2"><span class="nm">2.</span>R. Akiva says, if a man learned Torah in his youth, he should learn in his old age. If he had Talmidim in his youth, he should have Talmidim in his old age - "Seed your seed..."</p>
<p class="bas indent1"><span class="nm">(b)</span>R. Akiva had 12,000 pairs of Talmidim, from Gavas to Antiferus. They all died in one period, because they did not act with honor to each other. The world was desolate until R. Akiva went to our teachers in the south, R. Meir, R. Yehudah, R. Yosi, R. Shimon and R. Elazar ben Shamu'a, and taught them. They stood up the Torah at that time.</p>
<p class="bas indent1"><span class="nm">(c)</span><span class="cl">(Beraisa):</span> All 24,000 Talmidim died between Pesach and Shavuos.</p>
<p class="bas indent1"><span class="nm">(d)</span><span class="cl">(Rav Chama bar Aba):</span> They all died an evil death.</p>
<p class="bas indent1"><span class="nm">(e)</span><span class="cl">Question:</span> What is that?</p>
<p class="bas indent1"><span class="nm">(f)</span><span class="cl">Answer (Rav Nachman):</span> It is croup.</p>
<p class="bas indent1"><span class="nm">(g)</span><span class="cl">(Rav Masnah):</span> The Halachah follows R. Yehoshua.</p>
<p class="bas indent1"><span class="nm">(h)</span><span class="cl">(R. Tanchum):</span> A single man dwells without joy, Berachah or good;</p>
<p class="bas indent2"><span class="nm">1.</span>He lacks joy, for it says "You will rejoice, you and your household."</p>
<p class="bas indent2"><span class="nm">2.</span>He lacks Berachah, for it says "To put Berachah on your household."</p>
<p class="bas indent2"><span class="nm">3.</span>He lacks good, for it says "It is not good that man be alone."</p>
<p class="bas indent1"><span class="nm">(i)</span>In Eretz Yisrael, they say that he lacks Torah and a wall;</p>
<p class="bas indent2"><span class="nm">1.</span>He lacks Torah, for it says "If my helpmate is not with me, Torah is cast from me".</p>
<p class="bas indent2"><span class="nm">2.</span>He lacks a wall, for it says "A female will surround a man."</p>
<p class="bas indent1"><span class="nm">(j)</span><span class="cl">(Rava bar Ula):</span> He lacks Shalom, for it says "... Shalom is your tent..."</p>
<p class="bas subject"><span class="nm">5)</span>ONE MUST BE INTIMATE WITH HIS WIFE AT THE PROPER TIMES</p>
<p class="bas indent1"><span class="nm">(a)</span><span class="cl">(R. Yehoshua ben Levi):</span> If one knows that his wife fears Heaven but does not fulfill Onah (Bi'ah in the proper time), he is called a sinner - "v'Yadata Ki Shalom Ohalecha u'Fakadta Navcha v'Lo Secheta".</p>
<p class="bas indent1"><span class="nm">(b)</span><span class="cl">(R. Yehoshua ben Levi):</span> A man must be with his wife before he goes on a trip - "V'Yadata Ki Shalom Ohalecha (u'Fakadta Navcha)".</p>
<p class="bas indent1"><span class="nm">(c)</span><span class="cl">Question:</span> We know this from "Your desire is to your husband", that a woman desires her husband when he goes away (therefore he must be with her)!</p>
<p class="bas indent1"><span class="nm">(d)</span><span class="cl">Answer (Rav Yosef):</span> R. Yehoshua teaching is needed for Samuch l'Vestah (shortly before she is due to become Nidah. Rashi - Bi'ah is forbidden mid'Rabanan Samuch l'Vestah, except for one who is going away. Tosfos - Samuch l'Vestah is always forbidden, mid'Oraisa! R. Yehoshua obligates intimacy, but not necessarily Bi'ah.)</p>
<p class="bas indent1"><span class="nm">(e)</span><span class="cl">Question:</span> How long before is forbidden?</p>
<p class="bas indent1"><span class="nm">(f)</span><span class="cl">Answer (Rava):</span> It is the entire night or daytime in which her Veses falls.</p>
<p class="bas indent1"><span class="nm">(g)</span>This only applies to an optional trip. If he is leaving to do a Mitzvah he need not be with her, lest this distract him from the Mitzvah.</p>
<p class="bas indent1"><span class="nm">(h)</span><span class="cl">(Beraisa):</span> "V'Yadata Ki Shalom Ohalecha" applies to one who loves his wife as himself and honors her more than himself, guides his sons and daughters in the straight path, and marries them off shortly before adulthood.</p>
<p class="bas indent1"><span class="nm">(i)</span>"Then you will call and Hash-m will answer; you will call, and He will say 'I am here'" applies to one who loves his neighbors, draws his relatives close, marries his sister's daughter, and lends to a poor man when he needs it.</p>
