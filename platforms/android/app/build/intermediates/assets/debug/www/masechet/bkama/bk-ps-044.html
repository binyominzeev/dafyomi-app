<p class="bas subject"><span class="nm">1)</span>LIABILITY FOR MINORS</p>
<p class="bas indent1"><span class="nm">(a)</span><span class="cl">(Mishnah):</span> And similarly for a boy or girl.</p>
<p class="bas indent1"><span class="nm">(b)</span><span class="cl">(Beraisa):</span> "Or if it will gore a boy or girl" - (we kill the ox) for minors like for adults.</p>
<p class="bas indent2"><span class="nm">1.</span><span class="cl">Suggestion:</span> We should be able to learn from man, who is liable for minors like for adults!</p>
<p class="bas indent3"><span class="nm">i.</span>One who kills a minor is (killed) like one who kills an adult. Also, an ox that kills a minor should be (killed) like an ox that kills an adult!</p>
<p class="bas indent3"><span class="nm">ii.</span>Further, there is a Kal va'Chomer! A child who kills is not (killed) like an adult who kills, yet people are killed for killing children. A young ox that kills one is (killed) like a mature ox, all the more so, an ox that kills a minor is like one who kills an adult!</p>
<p class="bas indent2"><span class="nm">2.</span><span class="cl">Rejection:</span> No. A man who kills is more stringent, for he pays four (additional) damages. We cannot learn to an ox, which only pays Nezek. We need "a boy or a girl".</p>
<p class="bas indent1"><span class="nm">(c)</span><span class="cl">Question:</span> This teaches about a Mu'ad. What is the source for a Tam?</p>
<p class="bas indent1"><span class="nm">(d)</span><span class="cl">Answer #1:</span> The Torah said that we kill the ox for goring a man or woman, and for a boy or girl. Just like for a man or woman, Tam is like Mu'ad, also for a boy or girl.</p>
<p class="bas indent2"><span class="nm">1.</span>Further, there is a Kal va'Chomer! Men and women have less privileges regarding damages (when they damage, they are liable), yet a Tam is killed for them like a Mu'ad. Minors are privileged regarding damages (they are exempt for damage). All the more so a Tam is killed for them, like a Mu'ad!</p>
<p class="bas indent2"><span class="nm">2.</span><span class="cl">Question:</span> Can we make such a Kal va'Chomer, to be stringent?</p>
<p class="bas indent3"><span class="nm">i.</span>We are stringent for killing adults, for they are commanded to keep Mitzvos. Perhaps we are lenient for killing minors, who are exempt from Mitzvos!</p>
<p class="bas indent1"><span class="nm">(e)</span><span class="cl">Answer #2:</span> "If it will gore a boy, if it will gore a girl" - it says "gore" twice. The verse discusses a Mu'ad and a Tam that gore, regarding death and damages.</p>
<p class="bas subject"><span class="nm">2)</span>KILLING <i>B'SHOGEG</i></p>
<p class="bas indent1"><span class="nm">(a)</span><span class="cl">(Mishnah):</span> In the following cases, an ox is exempt:</p>
<p class="bas indent2"><span class="nm">1.</span>It was scratching on the wall, and it fell on a man;</p>
<p class="bas indent2"><span class="nm">2.</span>It intended to kill an animal, a Nochri, or a Nefel (stillborn baby), and killed a (healthy) Yisrael.</p>
<p class="bas indent1"><span class="nm">(b)</span><span class="cl">(Gemara - Shmuel):</span> The animal is not killed, but it pays Kofer.</p>
<p class="bas indent1"><span class="nm">(c)</span><span class="cl">(Rav):</span> It is exempt from both.</p>
<p class="bas indent1"><span class="nm">(d)</span><span class="cl">Question:</span> Why does Shmuel obligate Kofer? It is Tam!</p>
<p class="bas indent1"><span class="nm">(e)</span><span class="cl">Answer:</span> Elsewhere, Rav said 'the case is, the ox is Mu'ad to fall on people in pits.' Here, we can say that the ox is Mu'ad to kill people when scratching on walls.</p>
<p class="bas indent1"><span class="nm">(f)</span><span class="cl">Question:</span> If so, we kill the ox!</p>
<p class="bas indent2"><span class="nm">1.</span>Regarding the pit, we can say that it saw food, and therefore fell in. Here, it intended to kill!</p>
<p class="bas indent1"><span class="nm">(g)</span><span class="cl">Answer:</span> No, it was scratching for its own benefit.</p>
<p class="bas indent1"><span class="nm">(h)</span><span class="cl">Question:</span> How could we know this?</p>
<p class="bas indent1"><span class="nm">(i)</span><span class="cl">Answer:</span> After it fell, it resumed scratching.</p>
<p class="bas bbbline">44b----------------------------------------44b</p>
<p class="bas indent1"><span class="nm">(j)</span><span class="cl">Question:</span> This is only pebbles (the ox made the wall fall, and the wall killed)!</p>
<p class="bas indent1"><span class="nm">(k)</span><span class="cl">Answer (Rav Mari brei d'Rav Kahana):</span> The ox was pressing on the wall the entire time it was falling.</p>
<p class="bas indent1"><span class="nm">(l)</span><span class="cl">Support (for Shmuel, and question against Rav - Beraisa):</span> Sometimes the ox is killed and pays Kofer; sometimes the ox is not killed but it pays Kofer; sometimes the ox is killed but it is exempt from Kofer; sometimes it is exempt from both:</p>
<p class="bas indent2"><span class="nm">1.</span>A Mu'ad that intended to kill is killed, and it pays Kofer;</p>
<p class="bas indent2"><span class="nm">2.</span>A Mu'ad that did not intend is not killed, but it pays Kofer;</p>
<p class="bas indent2"><span class="nm">3.</span>A Tam that intended is killed, but it is exempt from Kofer;</p>
<p class="bas indent2"><span class="nm">4.</span>A Tam that did not intend is exempt from both.</p>
<p class="bas indent2"><span class="nm">5.</span>R. Yehudah says, if it damaged without intent, it pays;</p>
<p class="bas indent2"><span class="nm">6.</span>R. Shimon exempts.</p>
<p class="bas indent1"><span class="nm">(m)</span><span class="cl">Question:</span> What is R. Yehudah's reason?</p>
<p class="bas indent1"><span class="nm">(n)</span><span class="cl">Answer:</span> He learns from Kofer. Just like Kofer is paid even without intent, also damages.</p>
<p class="bas indent1"><span class="nm">(o)</span>R. Shimon learns from stoning. Just like we kill the ox only when it intended, also payment of damages.</p>
<p class="bas indent1"><span class="nm">(p)</span><span class="cl">Question:</span> Why doesn't R. Yehudah learn like R. Shimon?</p>
<p class="bas indent1"><span class="nm">(q)</span><span class="cl">Answer:</span> He prefers to learn payments from payments, not from death.</p>
<p class="bas indent1"><span class="nm">(r)</span><span class="cl">Question:</span> Why doesn't R. Shimon learn like R. Yehudah?</p>
<p class="bas indent1"><span class="nm">(s)</span><span class="cl">Answer:</span> He prefers to learn damages from stoning, which are both liabilities of the ox, not from Kofer, which is an atonement for the owner.</p>
<p class="bas subject"><span class="nm">3)</span>KILLING AN UNINTENDED VICTIM</p>
<p class="bas indent1"><span class="nm">(a)</span><span class="cl">(Mishnah):</span> If it intended to kill an animal, and killed a Yisrael... it is exempt.</p>
<p class="bas indent1"><span class="nm">(b)</span><span class="cl">(Inference):</span> Had it intended to kill Reuven and killed Shimon, it would be liable!</p>
<p class="bas indent1"><span class="nm">(c)</span>Our Mishnah is not like R. Shimon.</p>
<p class="bas indent2"><span class="nm">1.</span><span class="cl">(Beraisa - R. Shimon):</span> Even if it intended to kill Reuven and killed Shimon, it is exempt.</p>
<p class="bas indent1"><span class="nm">(d)</span><span class="cl">Question:</span> What is his reason?</p>
<p class="bas indent1"><span class="nm">(e)</span><span class="cl">Answer:</span> "The ox will be stoned, and also its owner will die" - death of the ox is like of the owner;</p>
<p class="bas indent2"><span class="nm">1.</span>Just like a man is killed only for killing his intended victim, also an ox.</p>
<p class="bas indent1"><span class="nm">(f)</span><span class="cl">Question:</span> What is his source that a man is killed only for killing his intended victim?</p>
<p class="bas indent1"><span class="nm">(g)</span><span class="cl">Answer:</span> "He waited in ambush for him, and rose upon him" - he must intend for his victim.</p>
<p class="bas indent1"><span class="nm">(h)</span><span class="cl">Question:</span> What do Chachamim learn from that verse?</p>
<p class="bas indent1"><span class="nm">(i)</span><span class="cl">Answer (d'Vei R. Yanai):</span> It excludes one who throws a rock into a group and kills someone.</p>
<p class="bas indent1"><span class="nm">(j)</span><span class="cl">Question:</span> What is the case?</p>
<p class="bas indent2"><span class="nm">1.</span>If the majority are Nochrim, even without this verse we would follow the majority (and not kill him, for it is as if he intended to kill a Nochri)!</p>
<p class="bas indent2"><span class="nm">2.</span>Even if half were Nochrim, for an even doubt we do not kill!</p>
<p class="bas indent1"><span class="nm">(k)</span>The case is, there are nine Yisraelim and one Nochri there. Even though the majority are Yisraelim, the minority is considered Kavu'a (fixed). It is like an even doubt; we do not kill when in doubt.</p>
<p class="bas subject"><span class="nm">4)</span>WHICH ANIMALS ARE KILLED FOR KILLING?</p>
<p class="bas indent1"><span class="nm">(a)</span><span class="cl">(Mishnah):</span> The following oxen are killed (for killing): the ox of a woman, of orphans (without an Apotropos), of (orphans with) an Apotropos, an ox of the wilderness, a Hekdesh ox, and the ox of a convert who died without heirs;</p>
<p class="bas indent1"><span class="nm">(b)</span>R. Yehudah says, we do not kill an ox of the wilderness, of Hekdesh, or of a convert who died without heirs, because it has no owner.</p>
<p class="bas indent1"><span class="nm">(c)</span><span class="cl">(Gemara - Beraisa):</span> It says 'ox' seven times in the Parshah. Six are extra, to teach about six special oxen that we kill: the ox of a woman, of orphans, of an Apotropos, an ox of the wilderness, a Hekdesh ox, and the ox of a convert who died without heirs;</p>
<p class="bas indent1"><span class="nm">(d)</span>R. Yehudah says, we do not kill the last three, because they have no owners.</p>
<p class="bas indent1"><span class="nm">(e)</span><span class="cl">(Rav Huna):</span> R. Yehudah exempts even if it had an owner, and he made it Hefker or Hekdesh after it gored.</p>
<p class="bas indent1"><span class="nm">(f)</span><span class="cl">Question:</span> What is the source for this?</p>
<p class="bas indent1"><span class="nm">(g)</span><span class="cl">Answer:</span> The Mishnah counts an ox of the wilderness and the ox of a convert who died without heirs as separate cases.</p>
<p class="bas indent2"><span class="nm">1.</span><span class="cl">Question:</span> Both are Hefker!</p>
<p class="bas indent2"><span class="nm">2.</span><span class="cl">Answer:</span> Both were taught to teach that even if it had an owner, and he made it Hefker or Hekdesh after it gored, R. Yehudah exempts.</p>
<p class="bas indent1"><span class="nm">(h)</span><span class="cl">Support (Beraisa - R. Yehudah):</span> Even if it had an owner, and he made it Hefker or Hekdesh after it gored, it is exempt - "the owner heard testimony on it, and it killed (again... the ox will be stoned)" - the trial of the ox must be like the goring, (i.e. when it has an owner).</p>
<p class="bas indent1"><span class="nm">(i)</span><span class="cl">Question:</span> We should require an owner also at the time of the verdict! "The ox will be stoned" is the verdict!</p>
<p class="bas indent1"><span class="nm">(j)</span><span class="cl">Correction:</span> Indeed, it should say 'the goring, the trial, and the verdict must be the same' (when it has an owner).</p>
<p class="bas subject"><span class="nm">5)</span>AN OX SENTENCED TO BE STONED</p>
<p class="bas indent1"><span class="nm">(a)</span><span class="cl">(Mishnah):</span> If Reuven's ox was being brought out to be stoned, and he made it Hekdesh, it is not Hekdesh. If he slaughtered it, the meat is forbidden.</p>
<p class="bas indent1"><span class="nm">(b)</span>Before a verdict was reached, if he made it Hekdesh, it is Hekdesh. If he slaughtered it, the meat is permitted.</p>
<p class="bas indent1"><span class="nm">(c)</span>If one gave an animal to a Shomer Chinam (one who guards a deposit for free), borrower, Shomer Sachar (he is paid to guard it), or renter, the Shomer is like the owner. A Mu'ad pays full damage, and a Tam pays half- damage.</p>
