<p class="bas indent1"><span class="nm">(a)</span><span class="cl">Question:</span> The Tana holds that one who eats a Rishon or Sheni is Posel Terumah, he does not Metamei it (make it able to Posel other Terumah, e.g. a Sheni) - who is the Tana?</p>
<p class="bas indent1"><span class="nm">(b)</span><span class="cl">Answer (Rabah bar bar Chanah):</span> It is R. Yehoshua:</p>
<p class="bas indent2"><span class="nm">1.</span><span class="cl">(Mishnah - R. Eliezer):</span> One who eats a Rishon becomes a Rishon, one who eats a Sheni becomes a Sheni, one who eats a Shelishi becomes a Shelishi;</p>
<p class="bas indent2"><span class="nm">2.</span>R. Yehoshua says, one who eats a Rishon or Sheni becomes a Sheni; Sheni becomes a Sheni, one who eats a Shelishi becomes a Sheni regarding Kodesh, but not regarding Terumah;</p>
<p class="bas indent3"><span class="nm">i.</span>This refers to Chulin Al Taharas (guarded as if they were) Terumah (but regular Chulin cannot become a Shelishi).</p>
<p class="bas indent1"><span class="nm">(c)</span><span class="cl">Question:</span> Why did they decree that one who eats a Rishon or Sheni becomes a Sheni?</p>
<p class="bas indent1"><span class="nm">(d)</span><span class="cl">Answer:</span> This is a decree lest he put Terumah liquids in his mouth together with Tamei food, which would Posel the Terumah.</p>
<p class="bas indent1"><span class="nm">(e)</span><span class="cl">Question:</span> Why did they decree that one who drinks a Tamei liquid becomes a Sheni?</p>
<p class="bas indent1"><span class="nm">(f)</span><span class="cl">Answer:</span> This is a decree lest he put Terumah food in his mouth together with Tamei liquids.</p>
<p class="bas indent1"><span class="nm">(g)</span><span class="cl">Question:</span> This is just like the previous decree (why are they counted separately)?</p>
<p class="bas indent1"><span class="nm">(h)</span><span class="cl">Answer:</span> One might have thought that we do not make the latter decree, because [it is common to drink while eating, but] it is not common to eat while drinking - the Mishnah teaches, this is not so.</p>
<p class="bas indent1"><span class="nm">(i)</span><span class="cl">(Mishnah):</span> One [a Tevul Yom] who entered his head or his majority in Mayim She'uvim [is Posel Terumah].</p>
<p class="bas indent1"><span class="nm">(j)</span><span class="cl">Question:</span> Why was this decreed?</p>
<p class="bas indent1"><span class="nm">(k)</span><span class="cl">Answer:</span> People used to immerse in [Mikva'os of] stinking water in caves; afterwards, they would pour [three Lugim of] Mayim She'uvim on their heads - it became Keva (primary), so they decreed about it.</p>
<p class="bas indent1"><span class="nm">(l)</span><span class="cl">Question:</span> What does it mean, 'it became Keva'?</p>
<p class="bas indent1"><span class="nm">(m)</span><span class="cl">Answer #1 (Abaye):</span> People used to say that the Mikvah is not Metaher without the Mayim She'uvim.</p>
<p class="bas indent1"><span class="nm">(n)</span><span class="cl">Objection (Rava):</span> That would not be a problem, for they would continue to immerse in the Mikvah!</p>
<p class="bas indent1"><span class="nm">(o)</span><span class="cl">Answer #2 (Rava):</span> People used to say that the Mikvah is not Metaher, only the Mayim She'uvim are.</p>
<p class="bas indent1"><span class="nm">(p)</span><span class="cl">(Mishnah):</span> A Tahor who had three Lugim of Mayim She'uvim poured on his head.</p>
<p class="bas indent1"><span class="nm">(q)</span><span class="cl">Question:</span> Why was this decreed (the above reason applies only to a Tevul Yom)?!</p>
<p class="bas indent1"><span class="nm">(r)</span><span class="cl">Answer:</span> If not for this decree on all people, the decree on a Tevul Yom would not be followed.</p>
<p class="bas subject"><span class="nm">2)</span><i>TUM'AH</i> OF HANDS</p>
<p class="bas indent1"><span class="nm">(a)</span><span class="cl">(Mishnah):</span> One who touched a Sefer.</p>
<p class="bas indent1"><span class="nm">(b)</span><span class="cl">Question:</span> Why was this decreed?</p>
<p class="bas indent1"><span class="nm">(c)</span><span class="cl">Answer (Rav Mesharshiya):</span> People used to store Terumah in the same place that Sifrei Torah were kept, for both of them are Kodesh;</p>
<p class="bas indent2"><span class="nm">1.</span>The Terumah [attracted mice, which] caused Seforim to be ruined - they decreed Tum'ah on Seforim [to discourage the practice].</p>
<p class="bas indent1"><span class="nm">(d)</span><span class="cl">(Mishnah):</span> [Stam] hands.</p>
<p class="bas indent1"><span class="nm">(e)</span><span class="cl">Question:</span> Why was this decreed?</p>
<p class="bas indent1"><span class="nm">(f)</span><span class="cl">Answer:</span> Hands touch many things (Rashi - perhaps they will touch filth and debase Terumah; alternatively - perhaps they touched Tum'ah).</p>
<p class="bas indent1"><span class="nm">(g)</span><span class="cl">(Beraisa):</span> Even hands that touched a Sefer Posel Terumah, on account of R. Parnach's teaching:</p>
<p class="bas indent2"><span class="nm">1.</span><span class="cl">(R. Parnach):</span> One who holds [the parchment of] a Sefer Torah in his bare hand [not through a cloth] will be buried bare.</p>
<p class="bas indent2"><span class="nm">2.</span><span class="cl">Objection:</span> This is unreasonable!</p>
<p class="bas indent2"><span class="nm">3.</span><span class="cl">Correction:</span> Rather, he will be buried bare of Mitzvos.</p>
<p class="bas indent2"><span class="nm">4.</span><span class="cl">Objection:</span> This is unreasonable!</p>
<p class="bas indent2"><span class="nm">5.</span><span class="cl">Correction:</span> Rather, he will be buried bare of that Mitzvah (of learning in it).</p>
<p class="bas indent1"><span class="nm">(h)</span><span class="cl">Question:</span> Which of these two decrees was first?</p>
<p class="bas indent2"><span class="nm">1.</span>We cannot say that the decree on Stam hands was first - if so, there would be no need to decree on hands that touched a Sefer!</p>

<p class="bas subject"><span class="nm">3)</span>OTHER THINGS THAT ARE <i>POSEL</i> THE <i>TERUMAH</i></p>
<p class="bas indent1"><span class="nm">(a)</span><span class="cl">(Mishnah):</span> A Tevul Yom.</p>
<p class="bas indent1"><span class="nm">(b)</span><span class="cl">Objection:</span> This is not a decree, he is Posel Terumah mid'Oraisa - "U'Va ha'Shemesh v'Taher"!</p>
<p class="bas indent1"><span class="nm">(c)</span><span class="cl">Correction:</span> We must delete Tevul Yom from the Mishnah.</p>
<p class="bas indent1"><span class="nm">(d)</span><span class="cl">(Mishnah):</span> Food that became Tamei through liquids.</p>
<p class="bas indent1"><span class="nm">(e)</span><span class="cl">Question:</span> What kind of liquids were Metamei the food?</p>
<p class="bas indent2"><span class="nm">1.</span><span class="cl">Suggestion:</span> The liquids touched a Sheretz.</p>
<p class="bas indent2"><span class="nm">2.</span><span class="cl">Rejection:</span> If so, the food is Posel Terumah mid'Oraisa!</p>
<p class="bas indent1"><span class="nm">(f)</span><span class="cl">Answer:</span> The liquids touched [Stam] hands - this is a decree on account of liquids that touched a Sheretz.</p>
<p class="bas indent1"><span class="nm">(g)</span><span class="cl">(Mishnah):</span> Vessels that became Tamei through liquids.</p>
<p class="bas indent1"><span class="nm">(h)</span><span class="cl">Question:</span> What kind of liquids were Metamei the vessels?</p>
<p class="bas indent2"><span class="nm">1.</span><span class="cl">Suggestion:</span> They are fluids of a Zav (spit, urine...)</p>
<p class="bas indent1"><span class="nm">(i)</span><span class="cl">Rejection:</span> If so, the vessels are Posel Terumah mid'Oraisa!</p>
<p class="bas indent2"><span class="nm">1.</span>"V'Chi Yarok ha'Zav ba'Tahor" - if a Zav spits on something the Tahor holds, he is Metamei it.</p>
<p class="bas indent1"><span class="nm">(j)</span><span class="cl">Answer:</span> The liquids touched a Sheretz - this is a decree on account of fluids of a Zav.</p>
<p class="bas indent1"><span class="nm">(k)</span><span class="cl">Question:</span> We said that these decrees were made when Beis Shamai outnumbered Beis Hillel - but Hillel and Shamai themselves decreed about hands, not their Talmidim!</p>
<p class="bas indent2"><span class="nm">1.</span><span class="cl">(Beraisa):</span> Yosi ben Yo'ezer and Yosi ben Yochanan decreed Tum'ah on Chutz la'Aretz and on glass vessels;</p>
<p class="bas indent2"><span class="nm">2.</span>Shimon Ben Shetach enacted [a lien on all a man's property to pay a] Kesuvah and decreed Tum'ah on metal vessels (this will be explained);</p>
<p class="bas indent2"><span class="nm">3.</span>Hillel and Shamai decreed Tum'ah on [Stam] hands.</p>
<p class="bas indent2"><span class="nm">4.</span><span class="cl">Suggestion:</span> Perhaps this means, Hillel and his followers and Shamai and his followers decreed.</p>
<p class="bas indent2"><span class="nm">5.</span><span class="cl">Rejection:</span> Rav Yehudah taught that there was an argument about all 18 things decreed - Hillel and Shamai argued about only three things [and Tum'ah of hands was not among them]!</p>
<p class="bas indent3"><span class="nm">i.</span><span class="cl">(Rav Huna):</span> Hillel and Shamai argued about three things and nothing else.</p>
<p class="bas indent2"><span class="nm">6.</span><span class="cl">Suggestion:</span> Perhaps Hillel and Shamai decreed to Toleh Terumah touched by Stam hands, and their Talmidim decreed to burn it!</p>
<p class="bas indent2"><span class="nm">7.</span><span class="cl">Rejection:</span> Ilfa taught that the initial decree regarding [Terumah that touched Stam] hands was to burn it.</p>
<p class="bas indent1"><span class="nm">(l)</span><span class="cl">Answer:</span> Hillel and Shamai decreed about Terumah touched by Stam hands, the decree was not accepted; their Talmidim decreed, the decree was accepted.</p>
<p class="bas indent1"><span class="nm">(m)</span><span class="cl">Question:</span> Shlomo decreed this [long before Hillel and Shamai]!</p>
<p class="bas indent2"><span class="nm">1.</span><span class="cl">(Rav Yehudah):</span> When Shlomo decreed Eiruvin and Netilas Yadayim, a Bas Kol (voice from Shamayim) said "Beni Im Chacham Libecha Yismach Libi Gam Ani" and "Chacham Beni v'Samach Libi va'Ashivah Chorfi Davar".</p>
<p class="bas indent1"><span class="nm">(n)</span><span class="cl">Answer:</span> Shlomo decreed regarding Kodshim, they decreed regarding Terumah.</p>
