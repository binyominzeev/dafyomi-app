<p class="dedicationbox">SHABBOS 101 - Two weeks of study material have been dedicated by Mrs. Estanne Abraham Fawer to honor the thirteenth Yahrzeit of her father, Rav Mordechai ben Eliezer Zvi (Rabbi Morton Weiner) Z'L, who passed away on 18 Teves 5760. May the merit of supporting and advancing Dafyomi study -- which was so important to him -- during the weeks of his Yahrzeit serve as an Iluy for his Neshamah. </p>

<p class="bas subject"><span class="nm">1)</span>KO'ACH IS PERMITTED REGARDING KARMELIS</p>
<p class="bas indent1"><span class="nm">(a)</span><span class="cl">Question:</span> What is the source [that Chachamim did not forbid Ko'ach regarding Karmelis]?</p>
<p class="bas indent1"><span class="nm">(b)</span><span class="cl">Answer (Beraisa):</span> One may not transfer from a ship to the sea or vice-versa;</p>
<p class="bas indent2"><span class="nm">1.</span>R. Yehudah says, if the ship is 10 deep (it is Reshus ha'Yachid) but the deck is not 10 above the water, one may transfer from it to the sea but not vice-versa.</p>
<p class="bas indent2"><span class="nm">2.</span><span class="cl">Question:</span> Surely, one may not transfer from the sea to it for this is from a Karmelis to a Reshus ha'Yachid - also the other direction should be forbidden!</p>
<p class="bas indent2"><span class="nm">3.</span><span class="cl">Answer:</span> We must say that R. Yehudah permits pouring on the side of the ship because it descends to the sea by itself.</p>
<p class="bas indent2"><span class="nm">4.</span>This shows that Ko'ach is permitted regarding aKarmelis.</p>
<p class="bas subject"><span class="nm">2)</span>GUD ACHIS MECHITZTA</p>
<p class="bas indent1"><span class="nm">(a)</span><span class="cl">(Rav Huna):</span> In a small boat of Meishan (the sides slope and meet at the bottom, like a 'V' shape), one may carry only within four Amos;</p>
<p class="bas indent2"><span class="nm">1.</span>This is only if it is not four wide within three Tefachim of the bottom [for then its walls are like hanging Mechitzos, which are invalid] - but if it is this wide, one may carry on the whole boat (it is as if the Mechitzos extend to the bottom).</p>
<p class="bas indent2"><span class="nm">2.</span>[Even if it is not four wide near the bottom,] if the bottom [until it is four wide] was filled with reeds and thin willow branches, one may carry on the whole boat.</p>
<p class="bas indent1"><span class="nm">(b)</span><span class="cl">Question (Rav Nachman):</span> We should say Gud Achis Mechitzta (it is as if the wall extends downward, from where it is four wide)!</p>
<p class="bas indent2"><span class="nm">1.</span><span class="cl">(Beraisa - R. Yosi b'Rebbi Yehudah):</span> If one inserted a pole in Reshus ha'Rabim with a basket (four by four) on top, and one threw something (from Reshus ha'Rabim) and it landed on the basket, he is liable.</p>
<p class="bas indent2"><span class="nm">2.</span>The basket is Reshus ha'Yachid on account of Gud Achis - likewise here we should say Gud Achis!</p>
<p class="bas indent1"><span class="nm">(c)</span><span class="cl">Answer (Rav Yosef):</span> Rav Yehudah taught that Chachamim [argue with R. Yosi b'Rebbi Yehudah, and] exempt!</p>
<p class="bas indent1"><span class="nm">(d)</span><span class="cl">Question (Abaye):</span> Surely, you agree with Gud Achis!</p>
<p class="bas indent2"><span class="nm">1.</span><span class="cl">(Beraisa):</span> If a pillar in Reshus ha'Yachid is 10 tall and four wide, but at the bottom it is less than four wide, [even] if the narrow part is three Tefachim tall [so Lavud does not apply], if one threw [from Reshus ha'Rabim] and it landed on top of it, he is liable.</p>
<p class="bas indent2"><span class="nm">2.</span>This shows that we say Gud Achis!</p>
<p class="bas indent2"><span class="nm">3.</span>Regarding the basket Chachamim do not say Gud Achis because goats can stick their heads through [the projected extension of the walls] - this does not apply to the pole (goats are not wont to come close to scratch themselves on it) or the boat!</p>
<p class="bas indent1"><span class="nm">(e)</span><span class="cl">Question (Rav Acha brei d'Rav Acha):</span> Regarding the boat, fish can break through [the projected extension of the walls]!</p>
<p class="bas indent1"><span class="nm">(f)</span><span class="cl">Answer (Rav Ashi):</span> We are concerned for penetration of goats, not of fish (for they are covered by the water).</p>
<p class="bas indent1"><span class="nm">(g)</span><span class="cl">Question:</span> What is the source of this?</p>
<p class="bas indent1"><span class="nm">(h)</span><span class="cl">Answer - Question (R. Tavla):</span> Does a hanging Mechitzah permit carrying in a ruined house?</p>
<p class="bas indent2"><span class="nm">1.</span><span class="cl">Answer (Ravin):</span> Chachamim gave this leniency only in water.</p>
<p class="bas bbbline">101b----------------------------------------101b</p>
<p class="bas indent2"><span class="nm">2.</span><span class="cl">Question:</span> Fish can penetrate!</p>
<p class="bas indent2"><span class="nm">3.</span><span class="cl">Answer:</span> This shows that we are not concerned for penetration of fish.</p>
<p class="bas subject"><span class="nm">3)</span>SHIPS TIED TOGETHER</p>
<p class="bas indent1"><span class="nm">(a)</span><span class="cl">(Mishnah):</span> If ships are tied to each other [one may carry from one to the other].</p>
<p class="bas indent1"><span class="nm">(b)</span><span class="cl">Objection:</span> This is obvious!</p>
<p class="bas indent1"><span class="nm">(c)</span><span class="cl">Answer #1 (Rava):</span> The Chidush is, one may even carry from one to a small boat in between them.</p>
<p class="bas indent1"><span class="nm">(d)</span><span class="cl">Objection (Rav Safra):</span> It says, one may carry from <i>one to the other</i> [implying that there are only two]!</p>
<p class="bas indent1"><span class="nm">(e)</span><span class="cl">Answer #2 (Rav Safra):</span> It teaches that [even if different people own the ships,] they may make an Eiruv and carry from one to the other:</p>
<p class="bas indent2"><span class="nm">1.</span><span class="cl">(Beraisa):</span> If ships are tied to each other, one may make an Eiruv and carry from one to the other;</p>
<p class="bas indent2"><span class="nm">2.</span>If they became separate, it is forbidden;</p>
<p class="bas indent2"><span class="nm">3.</span>If they were tied to each other again, they are permitted like before, whether they were tied b'Shogeg (he forgot that it is Shabbos or that tying is forbidden), b'Mezid, through Ones, or Misasek (engaged in tying something else).</p>
<p class="bas indent2"><span class="nm">4.</span>The same applies to mats spread [for Mechitzos] in Reshus ha'Rabim, one may make an Eiruv and carry from one [resulting Reshus ha'Yachid] to the other;</p>
<p class="bas indent3"><span class="nm">i.</span>If the mats were rolled up (they are no longer Mechitzos), one may not carry;</p>
<p class="bas indent3"><span class="nm">ii.</span>If they were spread again, they are permitted like before, whether they were spread b'Shogeg, b'Mezid, b'Ones, or Misasek (l'Chatchilah, one may not make a Mechitzah on Shabbos to permit something);</p>
<p class="bas indent2"><span class="nm">5.</span>Any Mechitzah made on Shabbos, whether Shogeg or Mezid, is considered a Mechitzah.</p>
<p class="bas indent1"><span class="nm">(f)</span><span class="cl">Question:</span> But Rav Nachman taught that they are Mechitzos only regarding throwing (to obligate one who throws to there from Reshus ha'Rabim, for mid'Oraisa they are Mechitzos), but they do not permit carrying inside!</p>
<p class="bas indent1"><span class="nm">(g)</span><span class="cl">Answer:</span> He refers only to Mezid (this is a fine. Above, we said 'whether Shogeg, Mezid, Ones...' - really, all of these are Mechitzos for throwing, but Mezid does not permit carrying. Tosfos - the fine is only when the Mechitzah makes Reshus ha'Yachid - if it was already Reshus ha'Yachid, and the Mechitzah is required mid'Rabanan, it is valid even if made b'Mezid.)</p>
<p class="bas indent1"><span class="nm">(h)</span><span class="cl">(Shmuel):</span> [It is permitted] even if the ships are tied with a drawstring of a cloak.</p>
<p class="bas indent1"><span class="nm">(i)</span><span class="cl">Question:</span> What is the case?</p>
<p class="bas indent2"><span class="nm">1.</span>If the string can hold them together, this is obvious!</p>
<p class="bas indent2"><span class="nm">2.</span>If it cannot hold them together, it should be forbidden!</p>
<p class="bas indent1"><span class="nm">(j)</span><span class="cl">Answer:</span> Really, it can hold them together - Shmuel teaches that another of his teachings does not apply here:</p>
<p class="bas indent2"><span class="nm">1.</span><span class="cl">Version #1 (our text) (Mishnah):</span> If a ship was tied with something that can hold it [and one end was in Ohel ha'Mes], it brings Tum'ah to the whole boat.</p>
<p class="bas indent2"><span class="nm">2.</span><span class="cl">(Shmuel):</span> This is if it was tied with an iron chain.</p>
<p class="bas indent2"><span class="nm">3.</span>Shmuel requires an iron chain only regarding Tum'ah, for it says "Ba'Chalal Cherev" - a sword [or any metal Kli exposed to Tum'as Mes] is like a corpse (it is Avi Avos ha'Tum'ah, it makes an Av ha'Tum'ah) - but regarding Shabbos, anything that holds them together suffices, even a drawstring.</p>
<p class="bas indent2"><span class="nm">4.</span><span class="cl">Version #2 (Tosfos) (Mishnah):</span> If a ship was tied with something that can hold it [and Tum'as Mes was underneath it], it brings Tum'ah to [underneath] the whole boat.</p>
<p class="bas indent2"><span class="nm">5.</span><span class="cl">(Shmuel):</span> This is if it was tied with an iron chain.</p>
<p class="bas indent2"><span class="nm">6.</span>Shmuel requires a solid chain only regarding Tum'ah, so it will not be a moving Ohel, which does not bring Tum'ah - but regarding Shabbos, anything that keeps them together suffices, even a drawstring.</p>
