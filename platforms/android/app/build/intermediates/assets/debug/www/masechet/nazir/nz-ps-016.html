<p class="bas indent1"><span class="nm">(a)</span><span class="cl">R. Oshaya (to R. Yochanan):</span> R. Yosi holds like you do, that he is Tamei only from when he sees.</p>
<p class="bas indent1"><span class="nm">(b)</span><span class="cl">Question:</span> R. Yosi said that they are Metamei retroactively!</p>
<p class="bas indent1"><span class="nm">(c)</span><span class="cl">Answer:</span> This is only mid'Rabanan.</p>
<p class="bas indent1"><span class="nm">(d)</span><span class="cl">Question:</span> If R. Yosi holds that Miktzas ha'Yom k'Kulo, how can a woman become a Zavah Gedolah (by seeing blood three consecutive days) and bring a Korban?</p>
<p class="bas indent2"><span class="nm">1.</span>The first part of the second (or third) day, before she saw, should be considered an intervening clean day!</p>
<p class="bas indent1"><span class="nm">(e)</span><span class="cl">Answer #1:</span> Blood was flowing continuously from the first day until the third day.</p>
<p class="bas indent1"><span class="nm">(f)</span><span class="cl">Answer #2:</span> On three consecutive nights, she saw at the start of the evening, so there was no time to count as a day.</p>

<p class="bas subject"><span class="nm">2)</span><i>TUM'AH</i> ON THE LAST DAY OF <i>NEZIRUS</i></p>
<p class="bas indent1"><span class="nm">(a)</span><span class="cl">(Mishnah):</span> If Reuven said 'I am a Nazir', he shaves (and brings Korbanos Nazir) on the 31st day. If he shaved on day 30, he was Yotzei;</p>
<p class="bas indent1"><span class="nm">(b)</span>If he said 'I am a Nazir for 30 days', and shaved on day 30, he was not Yotzei.</p>
<p class="bas indent1"><span class="nm">(c)</span>If one accepted to be a Nazir twice, he shaves for their completion on day 31 and day 61. If he shaved for the first on day 30, he shaves for the second on day 60. If he shaved on day 59, he was Yotzei.</p>
<p class="bas indent2"><span class="nm">1.</span>R. Papiyus testified to this law. It is because the 30th day is counted.</p>
<p class="bas indent1"><span class="nm">(d)</span>If Reuven said 'I am a Nazir'; and he became Tamei on day 30, this nullifies all the days he counted;</p>
<p class="bas indent1"><span class="nm">(e)</span>R. Eliezer says, only seven days are lost.</p>
<p class="bas indent1"><span class="nm">(f)</span>If he said 'I am a Nazir for 30 days', and he became Tamei on day 30, this nullifies all the days;</p>
<p class="bas indent1"><span class="nm">(g)</span>If he said 'I am a Nazir 100 days'; and he became Tamei on day 100, this nullifies all the days;</p>
<p class="bas indent1"><span class="nm">(h)</span>R. Eliezer says, only 30 days are lost;</p>
<p class="bas indent1"><span class="nm">(i)</span>If he became Tamei on day 101, this nullifies 30 days;</p>

<p class="bas indent1"><span class="nm">(k)</span><span class="cl">(Gemara - Mishnah):</span> Reuven said 'I am a Nazir'; if he became Tamei on day 30, this nullifies all the days he counted. R. Eliezer says, only seven days are lost.</p>
<p class="bas bbbline">16b----------------------------------------16b</p>
<p class="bas indent1"><span class="nm">(l)</span><span class="cl">Inference:</span> R. Eliezer holds that one who becomes Tamei after completing the term of Nezirus loses seven days.</p>
<p class="bas indent1"><span class="nm">(m)</span><span class="cl">Question (Mishnah):</span> If he said 'I am a Nazir for 30 days', and became Tamei on day 30, this nullifies all the days.</p>
<p class="bas indent2"><span class="nm">1.</span>R. Eliezer does not argue!</p>
<p class="bas indent1"><span class="nm">(n)</span><span class="cl">Answer:</span> (It is as if) he said complete days.</p>
<p class="bas indent1"><span class="nm">(o)</span><span class="cl">Question (Mishnah):</span> If one said 'I am a Nazir 100 days'; if he became Tamei on day 100, this nullifies all the days;</p>
<p class="bas indent2"><span class="nm">1.</span>R. Eliezer says, only 30 days are lost;</p>
<p class="bas indent1"><span class="nm">(p)</span><span class="cl">Answer:</span> We answer like above (6b), according to Bar Pada (who holds that Miktzas ha'Yom Lav k'Kulo) and Rav Masna (who disagrees. "Zos Toras ha'Nazir b'Yom Melos" obligates one who became Tamei on the last day of Nezirus to observe standard Nezirus. Rav Masna says that we discuss one who accepted 100 full days of Nezirus.)</p>

<p class="bas indent1"><span class="nm">(a)</span><span class="cl">(Mishnah):</span> If Reuven accepted Nezirus in a cemetery, even if he stayed there 30 days, they do not count. He does not bring Korbanos Nazir Tamei;</p>
<p class="bas indent1"><span class="nm">(b)</span>If he left (and became Tahor) and returned to the cemetery, the days are counted, and he brings Korbanos Nazir Tamei;</p>
<p class="bas indent1"><span class="nm">(c)</span>R. Eliezer says, if he returned on the day he became Tahor, he does not bring the Korbanos;</p>
<p class="bas indent2"><span class="nm">1.</span>"The first days will fall" - he brings Korbanos only if there were (at least two) first days.</p>
<p class="bas indent1"><span class="nm">(d)</span><span class="cl">(Gemara - R. Yochanan):</span> If Reuven accepted Nezirus in a cemetery, Nezirus takes effect on him.</p>
<p class="bas indent2"><span class="nm">1.</span>He holds that the Nezirus Taharah is pending. When he becomes Tahor, it takes effect.</p>
<p class="bas indent1"><span class="nm">(e)</span><span class="cl">(Reish Lakish):</span> Nezirus does not take effect on him.</p>

<p class="bas indent2"><span class="nm">1.</span><span class="cl">Inference:</span> he does not bring the Korbanos, but the Nezirus takes effect!</p>
<p class="bas indent1"><span class="nm">(g)</span><span class="cl">Answer:</span> No, the Mishnah teaches that the laws of Tum'ah and Korbanos do not apply to him.</p>
<p class="bas indent1"><span class="nm">(h)</span><span class="cl">Question (Beraisa):</span> If a Tamei (person) accepted Nezirus, he may not shave, drink wine, or become Tamei. If he did any of these, he receives 40 lashes.</p>
