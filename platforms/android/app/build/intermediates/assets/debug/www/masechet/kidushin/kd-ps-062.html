<p class="dedicationbox">KIDUSHIN 62 - Dedicated by a Talmid of Rabbi Kornfeld in Chicago. May Hashem bestow upon him and his wife Berachah in all their endeavors, and Yiddishe Nachas and joy from their dear children. </p>

<p class="bas subject"><span class="nm">1)</span>TANAYIM WITH A KEFEL</p>
<p class="bas indent1"><span class="nm">(a)</span><span class="cl">Question:</span> According to R. Chanina, we understand "if a man did not lie with you... Hinaki (you will be blessed." This implies that if she was Mezanah, she will be cursed);</p>
<p class="bas indent2"><span class="nm">1.</span>According to R. Meir, it should also say 'if you lied with a man, Chinaki (you will be choked)'!</p>
<p class="bas indent1"><span class="nm">(b)</span><span class="cl">Answer:</span> "Hinaki" is written without a Yud. It also alludes to 'Chinaki'.</p>
<p class="bas indent1"><span class="nm">(c)</span><span class="cl">Question:</span> According to R. Meir, we understand why "Hinaki" is written without a Yud (like above);</p>
<p class="bas indent2"><span class="nm">1.</span>According to R. Chanina, why was this necessary. We can infer that if she lied with a man, she will be choked!</p>
<p class="bas indent1"><span class="nm">(d)</span><span class="cl">Answer:</span> One might have thought that if a man did not lie with her, she will be blessed. If she lied with a man, even though she transgressed, she will neither be blessed nor cursed. Hinaki teaches that this is not so.</p>
<p class="bas indent1"><span class="nm">(e)</span><span class="cl">Question:</span> According to R. Meir, we understand "Hu Yischata Bo (he will be sprinkled with water with ashes of the red heifer) on the third day and the seventh day" and "if he will not be Yischata...";</p>
<p class="bas indent2"><span class="nm">1.</span>According to R. Chanina, why was this necessary?</p>
<p class="bas indent1"><span class="nm">(f)</span><span class="cl">Answer:</span> One might have thought that l'Chatchilah, he should be sprinkled on days three and seven, but b'Di'eved, if he was sprinkled on either of them, he is Tahor The Kefel teaches that this is not so.</p>
<p class="bas indent1"><span class="nm">(g)</span><span class="cl">Question:</span> Why must it say "the Tahor one will sprinkle on the Tamei one on the third day and the seventh day"?</p>
<p class="bas indent1"><span class="nm">(h)</span><span class="cl">Answer:</span> Had it said only the first verse, one might have thought that it says "third" and "seventh" to exclude the second and sixth days, for not enough time has elapsed from when he became Tamei, but sprinkling on the third and eighth days would be Metaher, for there are more days since the Tum'ah. The repetition teaches that this is not so.</p>
<p class="bas indent1"><span class="nm">(i)</span><span class="cl">Question:</span> Why does it say (at the end of the above verse) "he will be Metaher him on the seventh day"?</p>
<p class="bas indent1"><span class="nm">(j)</span><span class="cl">Answer:</span> One might have thought that to eat Kodshim, he needs sprinkling on days three and seven, but to eat Terumah, it suffices to be sprinkled on one of them. These words teach that this is not so (he is not Tahor at all until day seven).</p>
<p class="bas subject"><span class="nm">2)</span>SOMETHING THAT CANNOT BE DONE NOW</p>
<p class="bas indent1"><span class="nm">(a)</span><span class="cl">(Mishnah):</span> If Reuven was Mekadesh Leah, and he erred about her lineage (if she is a Bas Kohen or a Bas Levi) or her wealth (rich or poor), she is Mekudeshes, for she did not trick him.</p>
<p class="bas indent1"><span class="nm">(b)</span>If now Sam cannot be Mekadesh Sally, Kidushin will not take effect even if he stipulates that it take effect after the obstacle to Kidushin is removed, e.g.:</p>
<p class="bas indent2"><span class="nm">1.</span>After he converts or is freed;</p>
<p class="bas indent2"><span class="nm">2.</span>After she converts or is freed;</p>
<p class="bas indent2"><span class="nm">3.</span>After the death of her husband or her sister (Sam's wife);</p>
<p class="bas indent2"><span class="nm">4.</span>After she does Chalitzah.</p>
<p class="bas indent1"><span class="nm">(c)</span>Similarly, if Reuven told Shimon 'if your wife gives birth to a girl, she is Mekudeshes to me' (and gave money to him), she is not Mekudeshes.</p>
<p class="bas indent1"><span class="nm">(d)</span><span class="cl">(Gemara - Mishnah):</span> We cannot separate detached Peros to be Terumah on (exempt) attached Peros, nor vice-versa. B'Di'eved, it does not take effect.</p>
<p class="bas indent1"><span class="nm">(e)</span><span class="cl">Question (Rav Asi):</span> If one said 'detached Peros of this patch should be Terumah on the attached Peros of this patch (or vice-versa) when they are picked' does this work (after they are picked)?</p>
<p class="bas indent1"><span class="nm">(f)</span><span class="cl">Answer (R. Yochanan):</span> If something cannot take effect until an action is done, if he is able to to the action, it is if it was done.</p>
<p class="bas indent1"><span class="nm">(g)</span><span class="cl">Question (Mishnah):</span> Kidushin does not work even if he stipulates that it should take effect after he or she converts or is freed, after the death of her husband or her sister, or after she does Chalitzah.</p>
<p class="bas indent2"><span class="nm">1.</span>Granted, the last cases are not in his control, but he can convert if he wants!</p>
<p class="bas indent1"><span class="nm">(h)</span><span class="cl">Answer:</span> No, he cannot convert at will;</p>
<p class="bas indent2"><span class="nm">1.</span><span class="cl">(R. Chiya bar Aba):</span> Conversion must be in front of a Beis Din of three.</p>
<p class="bas bbbline">62b----------------------------------------62b</p>
<p class="bas indent2"><span class="nm">2.</span><span class="cl">Question:</span> What is the reason?</p>
<p class="bas indent2"><span class="nm">3.</span><span class="cl">Answer:</span> Conversion is called Mishpat, like monetary judgments.</p>
<p class="bas indent2"><span class="nm">4.</span><span class="cl">(Summation of answer):</span> One cannot convert whenever he wants. Perhaps he will not find a Beis Din of three to convert him.</p>
<p class="bas indent1"><span class="nm">(i)</span><span class="cl">Question (R. Aba bar Mamal):</span> If so, if Reuven is Mekadesh his Shifchah to take effect after Reuven frees her, it should work (since he can free her at will)!</p>
<p class="bas indent1"><span class="nm">(j)</span><span class="cl">Answer:</span> A Shifchah's acceptance of Kidushin (even with intent for after freedom) is meaningless.</p>
<p class="bas indent1"><span class="nm">(k)</span><span class="cl">Suggestion:</span> R. Yochanan would argue about R. Oshiya's law.</p>
<p class="bas indent2"><span class="nm">1.</span><span class="cl">(R. Oshaya):</span> If Shimon gave to his wife a Perutah and said 'you are Mekudeshes to me after I will divorce you' she is not Mekudeshes (after he divorces her).</p>
<p class="bas indent1"><span class="nm">(l)</span><span class="cl">Rejection:</span> No. Granted, Shimon can divorce his wife, but he cannot be Mekadesh her again without her consent.</p>
<p class="bas indent1"><span class="nm">(m)</span><span class="cl">Suggestion:</span> We can resolve R. Oshiya's question.</p>
<p class="bas indent2"><span class="nm">1.</span><span class="cl">Question (R. Oshaya):</span> If Reuven gave two Perutos to Leah and said 'you are Mekudeshes to me today with one Perutah, and you are Mekadesh to me with the other Perutah after I will divorce you', does the second Kidushin work?</p>
<p class="bas indent2"><span class="nm">2.</span>Since he cannot Mekadesh her again without her consent, he cannot stipulate to do this!</p>
<p class="bas indent1"><span class="nm">(n)</span><span class="cl">Rejection:</span> No. Perhaps since Kidushin is Tofes (takes effect) now, he can Mekadesh her also for after divorce.</p>
<p class="bas subject"><span class="nm">3)</span>EARLY STAGES OF DEVELOPMENT</p>
<p class="bas indent1"><span class="nm">(a)</span><span class="cl">Support (for R. Yochanan - Beraisa):</span> One may not separate detached Peros to be Terumah on attached Peros. B'Di'eved, it does not take effect.</p>
<p class="bas indent2"><span class="nm">1.</span>The case is, he said 'detached Peros of this patch are Terumah on the attached Peros of this patch (or vice-versa)' this has no effect;</p>
<p class="bas indent2"><span class="nm">2.</span>If he said, they will be Terumah when they are picked, it works (after they are picked).</p>
<p class="bas indent2"><span class="nm">3.</span>R. Eliezer ben Yakov says, even if he said 'detached Peros of this patch should be Terumah on the attached Peros of this patch (or vice-versa) after they grow to a third of their full growth and are picked', this works.</p>
<p class="bas indent1"><span class="nm">(b)</span><span class="cl">Version #1 (Rabah):</span> R. Eliezer ben Yakov said so only if the grain already grew enough to be used for fodder;</p>
<p class="bas indent1"><span class="nm">(c)</span><span class="cl">(Rav Yosef):</span> He said so even if it is Agam (soft sproutings).</p>
<p class="bas indent1"><span class="nm">(d)</span><span class="cl">Question:</span> What is the source that Agam means something that can be bent?</p>
<p class="bas indent1"><span class="nm">(e)</span><span class="cl">Answer:</span> "Will a man bend his head as an Agmon (hook)?"</p>
<p class="bas indent1"><span class="nm">(f)</span><span class="cl">Question:</span> Does R. Chanina hold like Rabah or like Rav Yosef?</p>
<p class="bas indent2"><span class="nm">1.</span><span class="cl">(Mishnah):</span> If Reuven told Shimon 'if your wife gives birth to a girl, she is Mekudeshes to me', this has no effect.</p>
<p class="bas indent2"><span class="nm">2.</span><span class="cl">(R. Chanina):</span> This is only if Shimon's wife is not pregnant. If she is pregnant (and gives birth to a girl), the daughter is Mekudeshes (when she is born).</p>
<p class="bas indent1"><span class="nm">(g)</span><span class="cl">Answer:</span> If R. Chanina holds like Rabah, she must be visibly pregnant. If he holds like Rav Yosef, it is even if she is not visibly pregnant.)</p>
<p class="bas indent1"><span class="nm">(h)</span><span class="cl">Version #2 (Rabah):</span> R. Eliezer ben Yakov discusses Shachas (grain that can be used for fodder), in a field nourished solely by rain, but not in a field that needs irrigation (for often, such fodder does not develop into grain);</p>
<p class="bas indent1"><span class="nm">(i)</span><span class="cl">(Rav Yosef):</span> R. Eliezer ben Yakov discusses Shachas even in a field that needs irrigation.</p>
<p class="bas indent1"><span class="nm">(j)</span><span class="cl">Question:</span> Does R. Chanina hold like Rabah or like Rav Yosef?</p>
<p class="bas indent2"><span class="nm">1.</span><span class="cl">(Mishnah):</span> If Reuven told Shimon 'if your wife gives birth to a girl, she is Mekudeshes to me', this has no effect.</p>
<p class="bas indent2"><span class="nm">2.</span><span class="cl">(R. Chanina):</span> This is only if Shimon's wife is not pregnant. If she is pregnant, the daughter is Mekudeshes.</p>
<p class="bas indent1"><span class="nm">(k)</span><span class="cl">Answer:</span> She must be visibly pregnant. R. Chanina can hold like Rabah or like Rav Yosef.</p>
