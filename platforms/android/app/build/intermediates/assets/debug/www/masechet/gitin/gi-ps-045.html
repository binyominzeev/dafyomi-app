<p class="bas subject"><span class="nm">1)</span>THE BUYER IS FINED</p>
<p class="bas indent1"><span class="nm">(a)</span>Rav Anan was unable to settle his doubt because he had not heard the Beraisa.</p>
<p class="bas indent1"><span class="nm">(b)</span>One cannot settle it from what Shmuel himself said that it is not sold. Perhaps he meant that it is not sold, and the money is like a gift, like one who was Mekadesh his sister:</p>
<p class="bas indent2"><span class="nm">1.</span><span class="cl">(Rav):</span> If one was Mekadesh his sister, she must return the money;</p>
<p class="bas indent2"><span class="nm">2.</span><span class="cl">(Shmuel):</span> He gave it for a gift. She keeps it.</p>
<p class="bas indent1"><span class="nm">(c)</span><span class="cl">Question (Abaye):</span> Why is the buyer fined? (Shmuel says, he does not get his money back, and the slave goes free.) The seller should be fined!</p>
<p class="bas indent1"><span class="nm">(d)</span><span class="cl">Answer (Rav Yosef):</span> If not for the hole (a place to put the stolen goods), the mouse could not steal!</p>
<p class="bas indent1"><span class="nm">(e)</span><span class="cl">Question: (Abaye):</span> If not for the mouse, the hole would not do anything!</p>
<p class="bas indent1"><span class="nm">(f)</span><span class="cl">Answer (Rav Yosef):</span> It is more reasonable to fine the buyer, since the Isur (the slave) is by him.</p>
<p class="bas subject"><span class="nm">2)</span>A SLAVE WHO FLED TO ERETZ YISRAEL</p>
<p class="bas indent1"><span class="nm">(a)</span>A slave fled from Chutz La'aretz to Eretz Yisrael. His master pursued and caught him.</p>
<p class="bas indent1"><span class="nm">(b)</span><span class="cl">R. Ami (to the master):</span> You must free him. We will make him write a document saying that he owes you his value. If you do not agree, I will free him based on R. Achi b'Rebbi Yoshiyah's teaching!</p>
<p class="bas indent2"><span class="nm">1.</span><span class="cl">(Beraisa) Suggestion:</span> "They (the seven Kena'ani nations) will not dwell in your land" - perhaps this is even one who accepted not to serve idolatry!</p>
<p class="bas indent2"><span class="nm">2.</span><span class="cl">Rejection:</span> "Do not return a slave to his master, who flees to you from his master." Rather, "he will dwell among you."</p>
<p class="bas indent2"><span class="nm">3.</span><span class="cl">Question (R. Yoshiyah):</span> Why does it say "his master"? It should say 'his gods'!</p>
<p class="bas indent2"><span class="nm">4.</span><span class="cl">(R. Yoshiyah):</span> Rather, the verse discusses one who sells his slave to Chutz La'aretz.</p>
<p class="bas indent2"><span class="nm">5.</span><span class="cl">Question (R. Achi b'Rebbi Yoshiyah):</span> Why does it say "who flees to you" - it should say, 'who flees from you'!</p>
<p class="bas indent2"><span class="nm">6.</span><span class="cl">Question (R. Achi b'Rebbi Yoshiyah):</span> Rather, the verse discusses a slave who flees from Chutz La'aretz to Eretz Yisrael.</p>
<p class="bas indent1"><span class="nm">(c)</span><span class="cl">(Beraisa - Rebbi):</span> "Do not return a slave to his master" discusses one who bought a slave in order to free him.</p>
<p class="bas indent1"><span class="nm">(d)</span><span class="cl">Question:</span> What is the case?</p>
<p class="bas indent1"><span class="nm">(e)</span><span class="cl">Answer (Rav Nachman bar Yitzchak):</span> He gave a document to the slave saying 'when I buy you, you are retroactively free from now.'</p>
<p class="bas indent1"><span class="nm">(f)</span>Rav Chisda's slave fled to Bei Kusoy (also in Bavel). He asked them to send the slave back. They replied "do not return a slave to his master (who flees to you from his master)."</p>
<p class="bas indent2"><span class="nm">1.</span><span class="cl">Rav Chisda:</span> The verse discusses a slave who flees from Chutz La'aretz to Eretz Yisrael, like R. Achi b'Rebbi Yoshiyah taught.</p>
<p class="bas indent2"><span class="nm">2.</span><span class="cl">Question:</span> Why didn't he explain the verse like Rebbi?</p>
<p class="bas indent2"><span class="nm">3.</span><span class="cl">Answer:</span> They were more likely to accept R. Achi's explanation, since it was closer to their understanding.</p>
<p class="bas indent1"><span class="nm">(g)</span>Abaye lost a donkey in Bei Kusoy. He asked them to return it; they asked him for a sign that it is his.</p>
<p class="bas indent2"><span class="nm">1.</span><span class="cl">Abaye:</span> Its stomach is white.</p>
<p class="bas indent2"><span class="nm">2.</span><span class="cl">The finders:</span> If we didn't know you (that you would never lie), we would not return it. All donkeys have white stomachs!</p>
<p class="bas subject"><span class="nm">3)</span>REDEEMING CAPTIVES</p>
<p class="bas indent1"><span class="nm">(a)</span><span class="cl">(Mishnah):</span> We do not redeem captives for more than their value. This is a decree for Tikun ha'Olam.</p>
<p class="bas indent1"><span class="nm">(b)</span>We do not help captives escape, for Tikun ha'Olam (lest captors be harsher with captives);</p>
<p class="bas indent1"><span class="nm">(c)</span>R. Shimon ben Gamliel says, this is to help captives.</p>
<p class="bas indent1"><span class="nm">(d)</span><span class="cl">(Gemara) Question:</span> How does this fix things? Is it to avoid depletion of the community's money, or so that captors will not be encouraged to capture even more?</p>
<p class="bas indent1"><span class="nm">(e)</span><span class="cl">Answer:</span> Levi bar Darga redeemed his daughter for 13,000 gold coins. (This shows that the concern is not lest captors capture more, rather, for the money of the community.)</p>
<p class="bas indent1"><span class="nm">(f)</span><span class="cl">Rejection (Abaye):</span> Perhaps Chachamim disapproved of his action!</p>
<p class="bas indent1"><span class="nm">(g)</span><span class="cl">(Mishnah):</span> We do not help captives escape, for Tikun ha'Olam. R. Shimon ben Gamliel says, this is to help captives.</p>
<p class="bas indent1"><span class="nm">(h)</span><span class="cl">Question:</span> What difference does it make which is the reason?</p>
<p class="bas indent1"><span class="nm">(i)</span><span class="cl">Answer:</span> This affects the law when now there is only one captive. (Chachamim forbid helping him to escape, and R. Shimon ben Gamliel permits.)</p>
<p class="bas indent1"><span class="nm">(j)</span>Rav Nachman's daughters used to stir (boiling) pots with their hands. This puzzled Rav Ilish. It says "I did not find one man in 1000 (so righteous to merit such miracles), and not a single woman", but Rav Nachman's daughters are so righteous!</p>
<p class="bas indent2"><span class="nm">1.</span>Rav Ilish and Rav Nachman's daughters were taken captive. Rav Ilish found a man who understood the language of birds. A raven was chirping at Rav Ilish. The man said that it was telling Ilish to flee.</p>
<p class="bas indent2"><span class="nm">2.</span><span class="cl">Rav Ilish:</span> One cannot rely on ravens. They lie.</p>
<p class="bas indent2"><span class="nm">3.</span>A dove chirped at Rav Ilish. The man said that it was telling Ilish to flee.</p>
<p class="bas indent2"><span class="nm">4.</span><span class="cl">Rav Ilish:</span> The congregation of Yisrael is compared to a dove. Surely, a miracle will be done for me! I will check Rav Nachman's daughters. If they are still so righteous, I will take them with me.</p>
<p class="bas indent3"><span class="nm">i.</span>He went to the privy, for there women relate their matters. He overheard them planning to ask the captors to take them further away, so they could live with them, and their real husbands will not come to redeem them.</p>
<p class="bas indent2"><span class="nm">5.</span>Rav Ilish fled with the man who knew bird language. Rav Ilish escaped; the man was caught and killed. He concluded that Rav Nachman's daughters stirred pots with their hands through witchcraft.</p>
<p class="bas subject"><span class="nm">4)</span>REDEEMING KISVEI HA'KODESH FROM NOCHRIM</p>
<p class="bas indent1"><span class="nm">(a)</span><span class="cl">(Mishnah):</span> We do not buy Sefarim, Tefilin or Mezuzos from Nochrim for more than their value, for Tikun ha'Olam.</p>
<p class="bas bbbline">45b----------------------------------------45b</p>
<p class="bas indent1"><span class="nm">(b)</span><span class="cl">(Gemara - Rav Budya):</span> 'We do not buy them for more than their value' implies that we may buy them for their value!</p>
<p class="bas indent2"><span class="nm">1.</span>This teaches that we may read from a Sefer Torah found by a Nochri!</p>
<p class="bas indent1"><span class="nm">(c)</span><span class="cl">Rejection:</span> Perhaps we may not read from it. The Mishnah discusses one who buys them to bury them (lest they be desecrated).</p>
<p class="bas indent1"><span class="nm">(d)</span><span class="cl">(Rav Nachman):</span> A Sefer Torah written by a Min (a zealous idolater) must be burned. If a (regular) Nochri wrote it, it is buried;</p>
<p class="bas indent2"><span class="nm">1.</span>A Sefer Torah found with (i.e. belongs to) a Min is buried;</p>
<p class="bas indent2"><span class="nm">2.</span><span class="cl">Version #1:</span> If it is found with a Nochri, it is buried.</p>
<p class="bas indent2"><span class="nm">3.</span><span class="cl">Version #2:</span> We may read from it.</p>
<p class="bas indent1"><span class="nm">(e)</span><span class="cl">(Beraisa #1):</span> If a Sefer Torah was written by a Nochri, we burn it.</p>
<p class="bas indent1"><span class="nm">(f)</span><span class="cl">(Beraisa #2):</span> We bury it.</p>
<p class="bas indent1"><span class="nm">(g)</span><span class="cl">(Beraisa #3):</span> We may read from it.</p>
<p class="bas indent1"><span class="nm">(h)</span>Beraisa #1 is like R. Eliezer, who assumes that all actions of a Nochri are for the sake of idolatry;</p>
<p class="bas indent1"><span class="nm">(i)</span>Beraisa #2 is like the following Tana.</p>
<p class="bas indent2"><span class="nm">1.</span><span class="cl">(Rav Hamnuna - Beraisa):</span> A Sefer Torah, Tefilin, or Mezuzah written by an informer, Nochri, slave, woman, minor, Kusi, or Yisrael Mumar is Pasul.</p>
<p class="bas indent2"><span class="nm">2.</span>"You will bind... and you will write" - only one who is commanded to wear Tefilin is qualified to write them.</p>
<p class="bas indent1"><span class="nm">(j)</span>Beraisa #3 is like the following Tana.</p>
<p class="bas indent2"><span class="nm">1.</span><span class="cl">(Beraisa):</span> We may buy Sefarim from Nochrim anywhere, as long as they are written properly.</p>
<p class="bas indent2"><span class="nm">2.</span>There was a Nochri in Tzidan who used to write Sefarim. R. Shimon ben Gamliel permitted buying from him.</p>
<p class="bas indent1"><span class="nm">(k)</span><span class="cl">Question:</span> Is it possible that R. Shimon requires tanning the hide l'Shem (for the sake of) Sefarim, but the writing does not require intent?!</p>
<p class="bas indent2"><span class="nm">1.</span><span class="cl">(Beraisa):</span> If Tefilin (boxes) were covered with gold, or were made from the hide of a Tamei animal, they are Pasul. If they were from the hide of a Tahor animal, they are valid, even if the hide was not tanned l'Shem Tefilin;</p>
<p class="bas indent2"><span class="nm">2.</span>R. Shimon ben Gamliel says, even the hide of a Tahor animal is Pasul unless it was tanned Lishmah.</p>
<p class="bas indent1"><span class="nm">(l)</span><span class="cl">Answer (Rabah bar Shmuel):</span> R. Shimon permitted buying (not from a real Nochri, rather,) from a convert who reverted to being a Nochri.</p>
<p class="bas indent1"><span class="nm">(m)</span><span class="cl">Question:</span> All the more so, what he writes is Pasul. He is considered a Min!</p>
<p class="bas indent1"><span class="nm">(n)</span><span class="cl">Answer (Rav Ashi):</span> He reverted because he feared for his life.</p>
<p class="bas indent1"><span class="nm">(o)</span><span class="cl">(Beraisa):</span> One may pay one Trape'ik more than their value.</p>
<p class="bas indent1"><span class="nm">(p)</span><span class="cl">Question:</span> How much is a Trape'ik?</p>
<p class="bas indent1"><span class="nm">(q)</span><span class="cl">Answer (Rav Sheshes):</span> It is one Istira (half a Dinar).</p>
<p class="bas indent1"><span class="nm">(r)</span>An Arab woman showed a sack of Tefilin to Abaye. He asked if she would sell each pair for a date. She was enraged, and threw them in the river.</p>
<p class="bas indent2"><span class="nm">1.</span><span class="cl">Abaye:</span> I should not have disgraced them so much in front of her.</p>
<p class="bas subject"><span class="nm">5)</span>DIVORCEES WHO MAY NOT REMARRY</p>
<p class="bas indent1"><span class="nm">(a)</span><span class="cl">(Mishnah):</span> If Reuven divorced his wife due to her ill repute, or because of a vow, he may never remarry her;</p>
<p class="bas indent1"><span class="nm">(b)</span>R. Yehudah says, if many knew about the vow, he may not remarry her. If not, he may;</p>
<p class="bas indent1"><span class="nm">(c)</span>R. Meir says, if the vow required a Chacham (to permit it), he may not remarry her. If it did not require a Chacham, he may remarry her;</p>
<p class="bas indent2"><span class="nm">1.</span>R. Yosi b'Rebbi Yehudah says, we were stringent about a vow that requires a Chacham only due to a vow that does not require a Chacham!</p>
<p class="bas indent1"><span class="nm">(d)</span>R. Yosi b'Rebbi Yehudah says, a case occurred in Tzidon in which Reuven vowed to divorce his wife, and divorced her. Chachamim permitted him to remarry her for Tikun ha'Olam.</p>
