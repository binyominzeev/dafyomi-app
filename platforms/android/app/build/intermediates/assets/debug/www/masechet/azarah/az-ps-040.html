<p class="bas subject"><span class="nm">1)</span>HETERIM FOR FISH AND THEIR EGGS</p>
<p class="bas indent1"><span class="nm">(a)</span><span class="cl">(Mishnah):</span> Tiryas that is not diced.</p>
<p class="bas indent1"><span class="nm">(b)</span><span class="cl">(Beraisa):</span> Tiryas is not considered diced if the head and spine are recognizable;</p>
<p class="bas indent2"><span class="nm">1.</span>'Brine in which there is a fish' is when a Kilbis (Rashi - a small Tamei fish; R. Chananel - a Tahor fish) or two are swimming in it. (This is a sign that the brine is from Tahor fish.)</p>
<p class="bas indent1"><span class="nm">(c)</span><span class="cl">Question:</span> If it is permitted when one is inside, there is no need to say so when two are inside!</p>
<p class="bas indent1"><span class="nm">(d)</span><span class="cl">Answer:</span> An open barrel must have two. A closed barrel is permitted with one (Rashi; Tosfos - vice-versa).</p>
<p class="bas indent1"><span class="nm">(e)</span><span class="cl">(Rav Huna):</span> The head and spine must be recognizable.</p>
<p class="bas indent1"><span class="nm">(f)</span><span class="cl">(Rav Nachman):</span> The head <i>or</i> spine must be recognizable.</p>
<p class="bas indent1"><span class="nm">(g)</span><span class="cl">Question (Rav Ukva - Mishnah):</span> Any fish with fins and scales is permitted. (This implies that there are no other (Tosfos - external) signs of Kashrus)!</p>
<p class="bas indent1"><span class="nm">(h)</span><span class="cl">Answer (Abaye):</span> Ara and Falmuda (two species of Tahor fish) are permitted only if one sees their fins and scales, for their heads resemble those of Tamei fish.</p>
<p class="bas indent1"><span class="nm">(i)</span><span class="cl">(Rav Yehudah):</span> Rav Huna and Rav Nachman only argue about the brine. Both agree that the fish itself is forbidden unless the head and spine are both recognizable.</p>
<p class="bas indent1"><span class="nm">(j)</span><span class="cl">R. Zeira:</span> I used to eat the brine even if only the head or spine was recognizable (I thought that they argued only about the fish itself). Now that I heard Rav Yehudah's teaching, I will not!</p>
<p class="bas indent1"><span class="nm">(k)</span><span class="cl">(Rav Papa):</span> The Halachah is, the head and spine of every fish must be recognizable.</p>
<p class="bas indent1"><span class="nm">(l)</span><span class="cl">Question (Beraisa):</span> If some (or even one) fish pieces have a sign of Kashrus, all the pieces are permitted;</p>
<p class="bas indent2"><span class="nm">1.</span>A case occurred in which a Nochri brought a barrel of pieces. One had a sign of Kashrus, and R. Shimon ben Gamliel permitted all of them.</p>
<p class="bas indent1"><span class="nm">(m)</span><span class="cl">Answer (Rav Papa):</span> The pieces were recognizably all from the same fish.</p>
<p class="bas indent1"><span class="nm">(n)</span><span class="cl">Question:</span> If so, obviously they are permitted!</p>
<p class="bas indent1"><span class="nm">(o)</span><span class="cl">Answer:</span> One might have thought that we are concerned lest by coincidence, they appear to all be from the same fish, but really they are not. The Beraisa teaches that we are not concerned.</p>
<p class="bas indent1"><span class="nm">(p)</span>A boat laden with Chilak came to Sichra. Rav Huna bar Chinena saw scales on the walls of the boat. He permitted the Chilak.</p>
<p class="bas indent1"><span class="nm">(q)</span><span class="cl">Rava:</span> We must be concerned lest some of the fish are Tamei!</p>
<p class="bas indent2"><span class="nm">1.</span>Rava forbade what Rav Huna bar Chinena had permitted.</p>
<p class="bas indent1"><span class="nm">(r)</span><span class="cl">(R. Yirmeyah of Difti citing Rav Papi):</span> Rav Huna bar Chinena permitted only the brine, but not the fish itself.</p>
<p class="bas indent1"><span class="nm">(s)</span><span class="cl">(Rav Ashi citing Rav Papa):</span> Rav Huna even permitted the fish.</p>
<p class="bas indent2"><span class="nm">1.</span><span class="cl">Rav Ashi:</span> I will not forbid the fish, because I heard from Rav Papa that they are permitted;</p>
<p class="bas indent2"><span class="nm">2.</span>I will not permit (even the brine), for Rav Yehudah said that Rav Huna and Rav Nachman argue about the brine. One may not eat the fish unless its head and spine are recognizable.</p>
<p class="bas subject"><span class="nm">2)</span>WHEN ARE FISH PERMITTED (cont.)</p>
<p class="bas indent1"><span class="nm">(a)</span><span class="cl">(Rav Chinena bar Idi):</span> If a Nochri brought a boat of barrels of brine, and one barrel had Kilbis in it (one or two, enough to permit it), all the open barrels are permitted (we assume that they had Kilbis, and it jumped out). Closed barrels (without Kilbis) are forbidden.</p>
<p class="bas indent1"><span class="nm">(b)</span><span class="cl">Question (Rav Ada bar Ahavah):</span> What is your source?</p>
<p class="bas indent1"><span class="nm">(c)</span><span class="cl">Answer (Rav Chinena):</span> I have three great sources - Rav, Shmuel and R. Yochanan.</p>
<p class="bas indent1"><span class="nm">(d)</span><span class="cl">(Rav Berona):</span> Fish innards and fish eggs may be bought only from a Mumcheh (Rashi - one who is skilled to discern; Ramban - a reliable Yisrael).</p>
<p class="bas indent1"><span class="nm">(e)</span><span class="cl">Question (Ula):</span> This implies that we are concerned lest the eggs are from a Tamei fish;</p>
<p class="bas indent2"><span class="nm">1.</span>Tamei fish give birth to fish. They do not lay eggs!</p>
<p class="bas indent1"><span class="nm">(f)</span><span class="cl">Answer #1 (R. Dosta'i d'Min Biri):</span> We must delete 'fish eggs' from Rav Berona's teaching.</p>
<p class="bas indent1"><span class="nm">(g)</span><span class="cl">Answer #2 (R. Zeira):</span> The teaching is correct. Tamei fish also lay eggs, just their eggs hatch inside the mother. Tahor eggs hatch outside the mother.</p>
<p class="bas indent1"><span class="nm">(h)</span><span class="cl">Question:</span> Why must fish eggs be bought from a Mumcheh? One can check the signs!</p>
<p class="bas indent2"><span class="nm">1.</span><span class="cl">(Beraisa):</span> The signs of Tahor fish are like the signs of Tahor eggs.</p>
<p class="bas indent2"><span class="nm">2.</span><span class="cl">Objection:</span> That cannot be! The signs of Tahor fish are fins and scales!</p>
<p class="bas indent2"><span class="nm">3.</span><span class="cl">Correction:</span> Rather, the signs of Tahor fish eggs are like the signs of Tahor bird eggs:</p>
<p class="bas indent3"><span class="nm">i.</span>One end of a Tahor egg is spherical, and the other is pointy. Both ends of a Tamei egg are spherical, or both are pointy.</p>
<p class="bas indent3"><span class="nm">ii.</span>The yolk of a Tamei egg is outside, and the white is inside. The yolk of a Tahor egg is inside, and the white is outside.</p>
<p class="bas indent3"><span class="nm">iii.</span>If the yolk and white are mixed together, this is a rodent's egg.</p>
<p class="bas indent1"><span class="nm">(i)</span><span class="cl">Answer (Rava):</span> The case is, the eggs are mashed, so the signs cannot be checked.</p>
<p class="bas indent1"><span class="nm">(j)</span><span class="cl">Question:</span> R. Dosta'i deleted 'fish eggs' from the teaching because he says that Tamei fish do not lay eggs;</p>
<p class="bas bbbline">40b----------------------------------------40b</p>
<p class="bas indent2"><span class="nm">1.</span><span class="cl">(Beraisa):</span> The signs of Tahor fish eggs are like the signs of Tahor eggs... (this implies that also Tamei fish have eggs)!</p>
<p class="bas indent1"><span class="nm">(k)</span><span class="cl">Answer:</span> The Beraisa did not say that. That was R. Zeira's correction;</p>
<p class="bas indent2"><span class="nm">1.</span>R. Dosta'i can correct the Beraisa to say 'the signs of Tahor fish <i>innards</i> are like the signs of Tahor eggs... '</p>
<p class="bas indent2"><span class="nm">2.</span><span class="cl">Question:</span> If so, it says that in Tahor innards, one end is spherical, and the other is pointier. Where do we find this?!</p>
<p class="bas indent2"><span class="nm">3.</span><span class="cl">Answer:</span> It is in the bladder of a fish.</p>
<p class="bas indent1"><span class="nm">(l)</span><span class="cl">Question:</span> If there is no Mumcheh, what should one do?</p>
<p class="bas indent1"><span class="nm">(m)</span><span class="cl">Answer #1 (Rav Yehudah):</span> If the seller says 'I salted them myself', one may rely on him (he would be afraid to lie).</p>
<p class="bas indent1"><span class="nm">(n)</span><span class="cl">Answer #2 (Rav Nachman):</span> The seller must say 'these are the fish, and these are the innards.'</p>
<p class="bas indent2"><span class="nm">1.</span>Rav Yehudah authorized Ada Daila to rely on a seller who says 'I salted them myself.'</p>
<p class="bas subject"><span class="nm">3)</span>OTHER PERMITTED FOODS</p>
<p class="bas indent1"><span class="nm">(a)</span><span class="cl">(Mishnah):</span> A leaf of Chiltis.</p>
<p class="bas indent1"><span class="nm">(b)</span><span class="cl">Question:</span> Obviously, this is permitted!</p>
<p class="bas indent1"><span class="nm">(c)</span><span class="cl">Answer:</span> The Mishnah permits even small pieces attached to the leaves (Ran; Rashi - or in the Keli);</p>
<p class="bas indent2"><span class="nm">1.</span><span class="cl">Version #1 (Rashi):</span> One might have thought that we are concerned lest the Nochri cut them with his knife. The Mishnah teaches that this is not so. We assume that they fell off with the leaves.</p>
<p class="bas indent2"><span class="nm">2.</span><span class="cl">Version #2 (Ran):</span> One might have thought that we are concerned lest the Nochri cut them with his knife. The Mishnah teaches that this is not so, for if so they would not cling to the leaves.</p>
<p class="bas indent1"><span class="nm">(d)</span><span class="cl">(Mishnah):</span> Clumps of soft olives.</p>
<p class="bas indent1"><span class="nm">(e)</span><span class="cl">Question:</span> Obviously, this is permitted!</p>
<p class="bas indent1"><span class="nm">(f)</span><span class="cl">Answer:</span> The case is, they are very soft;</p>
<p class="bas indent2"><span class="nm">1.</span>One might have thought that this is because wine was put on them. The Mishnah teaches that this is not so (their oil made them soft).</p>
<p class="bas indent1"><span class="nm">(g)</span><span class="cl">(Mishnah):</span> R. Yosi says, Shelachin (olives) are forbidden.</p>
<p class="bas indent1"><span class="nm">(h)</span><span class="cl">Question:</span> What are Shelachin?</p>
<p class="bas indent1"><span class="nm">(i)</span><span class="cl">Answer (R. Yosi bar Chanina):</span> One holds it with one hand, and the pit comes out.</p>
<p class="bas indent1"><span class="nm">(j)</span><span class="cl">(Mishnah):</span> Grasshoppers from...</p>
<p class="bas indent1"><span class="nm">(k)</span><span class="cl">(Beraisa):</span> Grasshoppers, caper fruits and leeks from the storehouse, pile or boat are permitted,</p>
<p class="bas indent2"><span class="nm">1.</span>Those sold in the market in front of the vendor are forbidden, because they sprinkle wine on them.</p>
<p class="bas indent1"><span class="nm">(l)</span>Similarly, apple wine of Nochrim from the storehouse, pile or basket it is permitted,</p>
<p class="bas indent2"><span class="nm">1.</span>What is sold in the market in front of the vendor is forbidden, because they mix wine with it.</p>
<p class="bas indent1"><span class="nm">(m)</span><span class="cl">(Beraisa):</span> Rebbi had a stomach ache. He asked if anyone knew whether apple wine of Nochrim is permitted.</p>
<p class="bas indent2"><span class="nm">1.</span><span class="cl">R. Yishmael b'Rebbi Yosi:</span> Once, my father had a stomach ache. They brought him 70 year old apple wine of Nochrim, and it cured him.</p>
<p class="bas indent2"><span class="nm">2.</span>Rebbi found a Nochri with 300 barrels of 70 year old apple wine. It cured him. He praised Hash-m for His Providence.</p>
<p class="bas indent1"><span class="nm">(n)</span><span class="cl">(Mishnah):</span> And similarly regarding Terumah.</p>
<p class="bas indent1"><span class="nm">(o)</span><span class="cl">Question:</span> What does this mean?</p>
<p class="bas indent1"><span class="nm">(p)</span><span class="cl">Answer (Rav Sheshes):</span> Similarly, if a Kohen is suspected of selling Terumah in the guise of Chulin, what is in front of him is forbidden;</p>
<p class="bas indent2"><span class="nm">1.</span>What he takes from the storehouse, pile or basket is permitted. He would not bring Terumah, lest Chachamim find out and make it all Hefker.</p>

<p class="bas subject"><span class="nm">4)</span>WHICH IMAGES ARE FORBIDDEN?</p>
<p class="bas indent1"><span class="nm">(a)</span><span class="cl">(Mishnah - R. Meir):</span> All images are forbidden, because they are served once a year;</p>
<p class="bas indent1"><span class="nm">(b)</span>Chachamim say, the only forbidden images are those holding a staff, bird or ball;</p>
<p class="bas indent1"><span class="nm">(c)</span>R. Shimon ben Gamliel says, any image holding anything is forbidden.</p>
<p class="bas indent1"><span class="nm">(d)</span><span class="cl">(Gemara) Question:</span> If they are served once a year, why do Chachamim permit them?</p>
<p class="bas indent1"><span class="nm">(e)</span><span class="cl">Answer (R. Yitzchak bar Yosef):</span> In R. Meir's region, all images were served once a year;</p>
<p class="bas indent2"><span class="nm">1.</span>R. Meir is concerned for the minority. He decrees in all places due to his place;</p>
<p class="bas indent2"><span class="nm">2.</span>Chachamim are not concerned for the minority. They do not decree in other places.</p>
<p class="bas indent1"><span class="nm">(f)</span><span class="cl">Version #1 - Rashi - Answer #2 (Rav Yehudah):</span> R. Meir and Chachamim argue about statues of kings.</p>
<p class="bas indent1"><span class="nm">(g)</span><span class="cl">Version #2 - Tosfos - Answer #2 (Rav Yehudah):</span> The Mishnah discusses statues of kings (and Chachamim permit them if they are not holding anything).</p>
<p class="bas indent1"><span class="nm">(h)</span><span class="cl">Version #3 - Rashba - Answer #2 (Rav Yehudah):</span> They argue about statues (R. Meir forbids every statue, lest it is a statue of a king, even though this is the minority. Chachamim are concerned only if it holds something). (end of Version #3)</p>
<p class="bas indent2"><span class="nm">1.</span><span class="cl">(Rabah bar bar Chanah):</span> The case is, the statues are at the entrance to the city.</p>
