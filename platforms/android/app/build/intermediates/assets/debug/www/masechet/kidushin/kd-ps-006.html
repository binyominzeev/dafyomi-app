<p class="bas subject"><span class="nm">1)</span>EXPRESSIONS OF KIDUSHIN</p>
<p class="bas indent1"><span class="nm">(a)</span><span class="cl">(Beraisa):</span> If he said 'you are my wife', 'you are my betrothed', or 'you are acquired to me', she is Mekudeshes;</p>
<p class="bas indent1"><span class="nm">(b)</span>If he said 'you are mine', 'you are in my domain', 'you are Zekukah (in need of) me', she is Mekudeshes.</p>
<p class="bas indent1"><span class="nm">(c)</span><span class="cl">Question:</span> Why didn't the Beraisa teach all six cases in one clause?</p>
<p class="bas indent1"><span class="nm">(d)</span><span class="cl">Answer:</span> The Tana first heard the first three cases, and taught them. He later heard the latter three, and appended them.</p>
<p class="bas indent1"><span class="nm">(e)</span><span class="cl">Question:</span> What is the law in the following cases? He said 'you are Meyuchedes (special) to me', 'you are Meyu'edes (designated) for me', 'you are my helpmate', 'you are my counterpart', 'you are Atzurasi (my gathered one )', 'you are Tzalasi (my side)', 'you are Segurasi (closed off to me)', 'you are under me', 'you are Tefusasi (the one I seized)', or 'you are Lekuchasi (the one I took).'</p>
<p class="bas indent1"><span class="nm">(f)</span><span class="cl">Answer (for to the last case - Beraisa):</span> If one said 'you are Lekuchasi', she is Mekudeshes, like it says 'Ki Yikach (when a man will take) a woman'.</p>
<p class="bas indent1"><span class="nm">(g)</span><span class="cl">Question:</span> If he says 'you are my Charufah', what is the law?</p>
<p class="bas indent1"><span class="nm">(h)</span><span class="cl">Answer (Beraisa):</span> If he says 'you are my Charufah' she is Mekudeshes, for it says "and she is a Shifchah (Kena'anis slave) Charufah to a man." Also, in Yehudah, an Arusah (one who was Mekudeshes, before Nisu'in) is called Charufah.</p>
<p class="bas indent1"><span class="nm">(i)</span><span class="cl">Question:</span> Since the Torah uses the word to refers to marriage, why must we bring support from the way people speak in Yehudah?</p>
<p class="bas indent1"><span class="nm">(j)</span><span class="cl">Correction:</span> The Beraisa means that in Yehudah, if one said 'you are my Charufah', she is Mekudeshes, because in Yehudah, an Arusah is called Charufah.</p>
<p class="bas indent1"><span class="nm">(k)</span><span class="cl">Question:</span> What is the case of the expressions about which we asked above?</p>
<p class="bas indent2"><span class="nm">1.</span>If he was not talking with her about Kidushin, how would she know that he intends to be Mekadesh her?</p>
<p class="bas indent2"><span class="nm">2.</span>If he was talking with her about Kidushin, he need not say anything else!</p>
<p class="bas indent3"><span class="nm">i.</span><span class="cl">(Mishnah - Rebbi Yosi):</span> If a man was talking with a woman about divorce or Kidushin, and gave her a Get or Kidushin money without specifying (that he intends to divorce or Mekadesh her), it works;</p>
<p class="bas indent3"><span class="nm">ii.</span>Rebbi Yehudah says, he must specify.</p>
<p class="bas indent3"><span class="nm">iii.</span><span class="cl">(Rav Huna):</span> The Halachah follows Rebbi Yosi.</p>
<p class="bas indent1"><span class="nm">(l)</span><span class="cl">Answer:</span> The case is, he was talking with her about Kidushin. Indeed, had he given the money silently, she would be Mekudeshes;</p>
<p class="bas indent2"><span class="nm">1.</span>If he said one of the doubtful expressions, we are not sure if he meant to be Mekadesh her or to employ her.</p>
<p class="bas indent1"><span class="nm">(m)</span>These questions are unresolved.</p>
<p class="bas indent1"><span class="nm">(n)</span><span class="cl">(Mishnah - Rebbi Yosi):</span> If a man was talking with a woman about divorce or Kidushin, and gave her a Get or Kidushin money without specifying, it works;</p>
<p class="bas indent1"><span class="nm">(o)</span>Rebbi Yehudah says, he must specify.</p>
<p class="bas indent1"><span class="nm">(p)</span><span class="cl">(Rav Yehudah and R. Elazar):</span> The case is, they were discussing the divorce or Kidushin (right before he gave it to her).</p>
<p class="bas indent1"><span class="nm">(q)</span>(Later) Tana'im argue about whether or not Rebbi Yosi and Rebbi Yehudah indeed argued in this case.</p>
<p class="bas indent2"><span class="nm">1.</span><span class="cl">(Beraisa - Rebbi):</span> The case is, they were discussing the divorce or Kidushin;</p>
<p class="bas indent2"><span class="nm">2.</span>R. Elazar b'Rebbi Shimon says, it is even if they were not discussing it.</p>
<p class="bas indent2"><span class="nm">3.</span><span class="cl">Question:</span> If he were not talking with her about Kidushin, how would she know that he intends to be Mekadesh her?</p>
<p class="bas indent2"><span class="nm">4.</span><span class="cl">Answer (Abaye):</span> They were discussing the divorce or Kidushin, then discussed related matters, and he gave a Get or money to her.</p>
<p class="bas indent2"><span class="nm">5.</span><span class="cl">(Rav Huna):</span> The Halachah follows Rebbi Yosi.</p>
<p class="bas indent1"><span class="nm">(r)</span><span class="cl">(Rav Yehudah):</span> Anyone who is not an expert in divorce and Kidushin should not rule about such matters.</p>
<p class="bas indent1"><span class="nm">(s)</span><span class="cl">Question (Rav Yemar):</span> Must one know even Rav Huna's ruling?</p>
<p class="bas indent1"><span class="nm">(t)</span><span class="cl">Answer (Rav Ashi):</span> Yes.</p>
<p class="bas subject"><span class="nm">2)</span>EXPRESSIONS OF DIVORCE</p>
<p class="bas indent1"><span class="nm">(a)</span><span class="cl">(Beraisa):</span> Similarly regarding divorce, if a man gave to his wife a Get and said 'you are sent', 'you are divorced', or 'you are permitted to any man', she is divorced.</p>
<p class="bas indent1"><span class="nm">(b)</span>Clearly, if he (gave her a Get and) said 'you are a free woman', this has no effect;</p>
<p class="bas bbbline">6b----------------------------------------6b</p>
<p class="bas indent1"><span class="nm">(c)</span>If he told his Shifchah 'you are permitted to any man', this has no effect.</p>
<p class="bas indent1"><span class="nm">(d)</span><span class="cl">Question:</span> If he told his wife 'you are to yourself', what is the law?</p>
<p class="bas indent2"><span class="nm">1.</span>Does he mean 'you may keep your earnings'?</p>
<p class="bas indent2"><span class="nm">2.</span>Or, does he mean 'you are entirely to yourself (i.e. divorced from me)'?</p>
<p class="bas indent1"><span class="nm">(e)</span><span class="cl">Answer (Ravina - Beraisa):</span> The essence of a Get of freedom is 'you are free' or 'you are to yourself'.</p>
<p class="bas indent2"><span class="nm">1.</span>'You are to yourself' works even for a slave, who bodily belongs to his master. All the more so, it works for a wife, since her husband does not own her!</p>
<p class="bas indent1"><span class="nm">(f)</span><span class="cl">Question (Ravina):</span> If one told his slave 'I have no involvement with you', what is the law?</p>
<p class="bas indent2"><span class="nm">1.</span>Does he mean, 'I have no involvement with you' at all (and you are free)?</p>
<p class="bas indent2"><span class="nm">2.</span>Or, does he mean 'I will not make you work for me'?</p>
<p class="bas indent1"><span class="nm">(g)</span><span class="cl">Answer (Rav Nachman - Mishnah):</span> If one sold his slave to a Nochri, the original master must free the slave with a document (this is a fine);</p>
<p class="bas indent2"><span class="nm">1.</span>R. Shimon ben Gamliel says, if the original master wrote Ono, no other document is needed.</p>
<p class="bas indent2"><span class="nm">2.</span><span class="cl">(Rav Sheshes):</span> An Ono says 'if you flee from your new master, I have no involvement with you.'</p>
<p class="bas subject"><span class="nm">3)</span>HOW MONEY FOR KIDUSHIN MUST BE GIVEN</p>
<p class="bas indent1"><span class="nm">(a)</span><span class="cl">(Abaye):</span> If a man was Mekadesh a woman with a loan, she is not Mekudeshes;</p>
<p class="bas indent1"><span class="nm">(b)</span>If he was Mekadesh her with the benefit of a loan, she is Mekudeshes, but this is forbidden because it is a ruse for usury.</p>
<p class="bas indent1"><span class="nm">(c)</span><span class="cl">Question:</span> What is the case of benefit of a loan?</p>
<p class="bas indent2"><span class="nm">1.</span><span class="cl">Suggestion:</span> He lent her four coins on condition that she repay five, and he is Mekadesh her with the fifth coin.</p>
<p class="bas indent2"><span class="nm">2.</span><span class="cl">Rejection #1:</span> That is absolute interest, not just a ruse!</p>
<p class="bas indent2"><span class="nm">3.</span><span class="cl">Rejection #2:</span> That is just like Kidushin with a loan (which does not work)!</p>
<p class="bas indent1"><span class="nm">(d)</span><span class="cl">Answer:</span> Rather, he granted her an extension on her loan (Rashi; Tosfos - he paid her creditor to grant her an extension).</p>
<p class="bas indent1"><span class="nm">(e)</span><span class="cl">(Rava):</span> If one said 'here is money on condition that you return it to me', this is not a valid Kinyan Kesef (to buy land), it cannot make Kidushin, and (if he give to a Kohen) it cannot redeem a firstborn son;</p>
<p class="bas indent2"><span class="nm">1.</span>One fulfills the Mitzvah of giving Terumah even if he stipulates that the Kohen return it;</p>
<p class="bas indent2"><span class="nm">2.</span>However, this is forbidden, for it is like a Kohen who helps in the granary in exchange for receiving Terumah.</p>
<p class="bas indent1"><span class="nm">(f)</span><span class="cl">Objection #1:</span> No matter how Rava holds, this is difficult!</p>
<p class="bas indent2"><span class="nm">1.</span>If a gift on condition to return it is considered a gift, it should work in all the cases!</p>
<p class="bas indent2"><span class="nm">2.</span>If it is not considered a gift, it should not help for Terumah, either!</p>
<p class="bas indent1"><span class="nm">(g)</span><span class="cl">Objection #2:</span> Elsewhere, Rava considers it to be a gift!</p>
<p class="bas indent2"><span class="nm">1.</span><span class="cl">(Rava):</span> If one said 'this Esrog is yours on condition that you return it to me', the recipient fulfilled the Mitzvah only if he returned it.</p>
<p class="bas indent1"><span class="nm">(h)</span><span class="cl">(Rav Ashi):</span> Rather, such a gift works in all cases, except for Kidushin, because (it is like Chalipin, and) a woman cannot be acquired through Chalipin.</p>
<p class="bas indent1"><span class="nm">(i)</span><span class="cl">(Rav Huna Mar Brei d'Rav Nechemyah):</span> I heard that Rava actually taught like you said.</p>
