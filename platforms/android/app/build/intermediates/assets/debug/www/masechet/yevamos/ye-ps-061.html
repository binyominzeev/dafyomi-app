<p class="bas subject"><span class="nm">1)</span>THE TUM'AH OF NOCHRIM</p>
<p class="bas indent1"><span class="nm">(a)</span><span class="cl">(Beraisa - R. Shimon):</span> The graves of Nochrim do not have Tum'as Ohel (they are not Metamei what towers above them. Regarding Tum'as Ohel it says "Adam Ki Yamus b'Ohel", and) it says "You are my flock... you are Adam";</p>
<p class="bas indent2"><span class="nm">1.</span>You (Yisrael) are called Adam, but Nochrim are not called Adam.</p>
<p class="bas indent1"><span class="nm">(b)</span><span class="cl">Question:</span> "V'Nefesh Adam Shishah Asar Elef" (captives were taken from Midyan)!</p>
<p class="bas indent1"><span class="nm">(c)</span><span class="cl">Answer:</span> It says "Adam" to distinguish from the animals.</p>
<p class="bas indent1"><span class="nm">(d)</span><span class="cl">Question:</span> "(Ninveh) has more than 120,000 Adam..."!</p>
<p class="bas indent1"><span class="nm">(e)</span><span class="cl">Answer:</span> It says Adam to distinguish from the animals.</p>
<p class="bas indent1"><span class="nm">(f)</span><span class="cl">Question:</span> "Whoever killed a soul (in the war against Midyan) and touched a Mes will make himself Tahor" (this shows that a dead Nochri is Metamei)!</p>
<p class="bas indent1"><span class="nm">(g)</span><span class="cl">Answer #1:</span> Perhaps a Yisrael died.</p>
<p class="bas indent2"><span class="nm">1.</span>Chachamim do not accept this answer, for it says "V'Lo Nifkad Mimenu Ish";</p>
<p class="bas indent2"><span class="nm">2.</span>R. Shimon holds that this means that no one stumbled in sin.</p>
<p class="bas indent1"><span class="nm">(h)</span><span class="cl">Answer #2 (Ravina):</span> R. Shimon says that Nochrim are excluded from Tum'as Ohel. They are not excluded from Tum'ah of carrying or touching!</p>
<p class="bas subject"><span class="nm">2)</span>WHEN CAN A <i>KOHEN</i> <i>GADOL</i> MARRY A WIDOW?</p>
<p class="bas indent1"><span class="nm">(a)</span><span class="cl">(Mishnah):</span> If a Kohen was Mekadesh a widow and then was appointed to be Kohen Gadol, he may marry her.</p>
<p class="bas indent1"><span class="nm">(b)</span>A case occurred in which Yehoshua ben Gamla was Mekadesh Marsa Bas Baisus. The king appointed him to be Kohen Gadol, and he married her.</p>
<p class="bas indent1"><span class="nm">(c)</span>If a Yevamah fell to a Kohen, and he was appointed to be Kohen Gadol, even if he had given her a Ma'amar, he may not do Yibum.</p>
<p class="bas indent1"><span class="nm">(d)</span><span class="cl">(Gemara) Question:</span> What is the source that if a Kohen was Mekadesh a widow, then was appointed Kohen Gadol, he may marry her?</p>
<p class="bas indent1"><span class="nm">(e)</span><span class="cl">Answer:</span> "He will take a wife".</p>
<p class="bas indent1"><span class="nm">(f)</span><span class="cl">Objection:</span> If so, this should also permit him to do Yibum!</p>
<p class="bas indent1"><span class="nm">(g)</span><span class="cl">Answer:</span> "He will take a <i>wife</i>",  but not a Yevamah.</p>
<p class="bas indent1"><span class="nm">(h)</span><span class="cl">(Mishnah):</span> A case occurred in which Yehoshua ben Gamla...</p>
<p class="bas indent1"><span class="nm">(i)</span><span class="cl">Inference:</span> It says that the king appointed him. He was not appointed (by the Kohanim and Sanhedrin)!</p>
<p class="bas indent1"><span class="nm">(j)</span><span class="cl">Rav Yosef:</span> This was the scheme of Resha'im!</p>
<p class="bas indent2"><span class="nm">1.</span><span class="cl">(Rav Asi):</span> Marsa bas Baisus bribed King Yanai with a Tarkav (about six liters) of gold coins so he would appoint R. Yehoshua ben Gamla to be Kohen Gadol.</p>
<p class="bas indent1"><span class="nm">(k)</span><span class="cl">(Mishnah):</span> If the Kohen Gadol's brother died, the Kohen Gadol does Chalitzah, but not Yibum.</p>
<p class="bas indent1"><span class="nm">(l)</span><span class="cl">(Gemara) Inference:</span> The Mishnah does not distinguish if she was widowed from Eirusin or Nisu'in!</p>
<p class="bas indent1"><span class="nm">(m)</span><span class="cl">Question:</span> Granted, from Nisu'in she is forbidden to him with a Lav (a widow) and an Aseh (non-virgin). The Mitzvas Aseh of Yibum does not override a Lav and Aseh;</p>
<p class="bas indent2"><span class="nm">1.</span>However, if she was widowed from Eirusin, the Aseh of Yibum should override the Lav of a widow!</p>
<p class="bas indent1"><span class="nm">(n)</span><span class="cl">Answer:</span> Mid'Oraisa, it does. Chachamim decreed against the first Bi'ah (Yibum), lest he come to do a second act (which is forbidden).</p>
<p class="bas subject"><span class="nm">3)</span>MAY A <i>KOHEN</i> MARRY AN <i>AILONIS</i>?</p>
<p class="bas indent1"><span class="nm">(a)</span><span class="cl">(Mishnah):</span> A regular Kohen may not marry an Ailonis, unless he already has a wife and children;</p>
<p class="bas indent1"><span class="nm">(b)</span>R. Yehudah says, even if he has a wife and children he may not marry her, since she is a Zonah;</p>
<p class="bas indent1"><span class="nm">(c)</span>Chachamim say that only a convert, freed slave, or one who had Bi'as Zenus is a Zonah.</p>
<p class="bas indent1"><span class="nm">(d)</span><span class="cl">(Gemara - Reish Galusa) Question:</span> Why can't a Kohen marry an Ailonis?</p>
<p class="bas indent1"><span class="nm">(e)</span><span class="cl">Answer (Rav Huna):</span> He must fulfill Peru u'Rvu (having children).</p>
<p class="bas indent1"><span class="nm">(f)</span><span class="cl">Question (Reish Galusa):</span> Also Yisraelim have this Mitzvah!</p>
<p class="bas indent1"><span class="nm">(g)</span><span class="cl">Answer (Rav Huna):</span> It mentions Kohanim due to the Seifa. R. Yehudah says, even if he has a wife and children he may not marry her, since she is a Zonah;</p>
<p class="bas bbbline">61b----------------------------------------61b</p>
<p class="bas indent2"><span class="nm">1.</span>A Zonah is forbidden only to Kohanim, but not to Yisraelim.</p>
<p class="bas indent1"><span class="nm">(h)</span><span class="cl">Question:</span> What is R. Yehudah's reason?</p>
<p class="bas indent1"><span class="nm">(i)</span><span class="cl">Answer (Rav Huna):</span> "They ate and were not satiated, they were Mezaneh and did not spread (progeny)" - any Bi'ah that (is with a woman who) cannot procreate is Zenus.</p>
<p class="bas subject"><span class="nm">4)</span>A <i>KOHEN</i> MAY NOT MARRY A MINOR</p>
<p class="bas indent1"><span class="nm">(a)</span><span class="cl">(Beraisa - R. Eliezer):</span> A Kohen may not marry a minor.</p>
<p class="bas indent1"><span class="nm">(b)</span><span class="cl">Rav Chisda (to Rabah):</span> Investigate this law, for Rav Huna will ask you about it tonight.</p>
<p class="bas indent1"><span class="nm">(c)</span><span class="cl">Explanation #1 (Rabah):</span> R. Eliezer holds like R. Meir and as R. Yehudah:</p>
<p class="bas indent2"><span class="nm">1.</span>He holds like R. Meir, who is concerned for the minority (perhaps she is an Ailonis);</p>
<p class="bas indent2"><span class="nm">2.</span>He holds like R. Yehudah, who says that an Ailonis is a Zonah.</p>
<p class="bas indent1"><span class="nm">(d)</span><span class="cl">Objection #1:</span> R. Eliezer does not hold like R. Meir!</p>
<p class="bas indent2"><span class="nm">1.</span><span class="cl">(Beraisa - R. Meir):</span> A male or female minor may not do Chalitzah nor Yibum;</p>
<p class="bas indent2"><span class="nm">2.</span><span class="cl">Question (Chachamim):</span> We agree that they may not do Chalitzah, for it says "Ish (an adult)", and we equate her to him. Why can't they do Yibum?</p>
<p class="bas indent2"><span class="nm">3.</span><span class="cl">Answer (R. Meir):</span> If they do Yibum and we find that he is a Seris or she is an Ailonis, they transgressed Ervah (there was no Mitzvah of Yibum to permit Eshes Ach).</p>
<p class="bas indent2"><span class="nm">4.</span><span class="cl">(Beraisa - R. Eliezer):</span> A girl who is a minor may do Yibum, but not Chalitzah. (This shows that he is not concerned lest she is an Ailonis!)</p>
<p class="bas indent1"><span class="nm">(e)</span><span class="cl">Objection #2:</span> R. Eliezer does not hold like R. Yehudah!</p>
<p class="bas indent2"><span class="nm">1.</span><span class="cl">(Beraisa - R. Eliezer):</span> A Zonah is like her name (an adulteress);</p>
<p class="bas indent2"><span class="nm">2.</span>R. Akiva says, she is a woman open to have Bi'ah with anyone;</p>
<p class="bas indent2"><span class="nm">3.</span>R. Masya ben Charash says, even if her husband was taking her to drink (Sotah water) and he had Bi'ah with her on the way, she becomes a Zonah;</p>
<p class="bas indent2"><span class="nm">4.</span>R. Yehudah says, a Zonah is an Ailonis;</p>
<p class="bas indent2"><span class="nm">5.</span>Chachamim say that a Zonah is only a convert, a freed slave, or one who had Bi'as Zenus;</p>
<p class="bas indent2"><span class="nm">6.</span>R. Elazar says, if two singles had Bi'ah without intent for Kidushin, she becomes a Zonah.</p>
<p class="bas indent1"><span class="nm">(f)</span><span class="cl">Explanation #2 (Rav Ada bar Ahavah):</span> R. Eliezer forbids a Kohen <i>Gadol</i> to marry a minor;</p>
<p class="bas indent2"><span class="nm">1.</span>The marriage takes effect when she becomes a Bogeres, and then she is not a (full) Besulah!</p>
<p class="bas indent1"><span class="nm">(g)</span><span class="cl">Objection (Rava):</span> If her father was Mekadesh her, the marriage takes effect immediately! If she married herself off, also Chachamim would forbid!</p>
<p class="bas indent1"><span class="nm">(h)</span><span class="cl">Explanation #3 (Rava):</span> Really, R. Eliezer discusses a regular Kohen. We are concerned lest she be enticed to Zenus.</p>
<p class="bas indent1"><span class="nm">(i)</span><span class="cl">Question:</span> This concern also applies to a Yisrael!</p>
<p class="bas indent1"><span class="nm">(j)</span><span class="cl">Answer:</span> Enticement of a minor is considered Ones. This does not forbid a Yisrael's wife.</p>
<p class="bas indent1"><span class="nm">(k)</span><span class="cl">Explanation #4 (Rav Papa):</span> R. Eliezer discusses a Kohen Gadol. He holds like the following Tana:</p>
<p class="bas indent2"><span class="nm">1.</span><span class="cl">(Beraisa) Suggestion:</span> Perhaps "Besulah" must be a minor!</p>
<p class="bas indent2"><span class="nm">2.</span><span class="cl">Rejection:</span> "(He will take an) Ishah" (an adult).</p>
<p class="bas indent2"><span class="nm">3.</span><span class="cl">Suggestion:</span> Perhaps "Ishah" must be a Bogeres!</p>
<p class="bas indent2"><span class="nm">4.</span><span class="cl">Rejection:</span> "Besulah".</p>
<p class="bas indent2"><span class="nm">5.</span><span class="cl">Resolution:</span> She is not a minor, but she is not yet a Bogeres (she is in the six months of Na'arus).</p>
<p class="bas indent1"><span class="nm">(l)</span><span class="cl">Explanation #5 (Rav Nachman bar Yitzchak):</span> R. Eliezer holds like the following Tana:</p>
<p class="bas indent2"><span class="nm">1.</span><span class="cl">(Beraisa):</span> "Besulah" refers only to a Na'arah, like it says, "Veha'Na'arah Yafah Me'od Besulah". (Ramban - Seder Olam says that Rivkah was three at the time. Rav Nachman holds that she was 14, like the Sifri. We must say that she brought two hairs less than six months before this.)</p>
<p class="bas indent1"><span class="nm">(m)</span><span class="cl">(Beraisa - R. Elazar):</span> If two singles had Bi'ah without intent for Kidushin, she becomes a Zonah.</p>
<p class="bas indent1"><span class="nm">(n)</span><span class="cl">(Rav Amram):</span> The Halachah does not follow R. Elazar.</p>
<p class="bas subject"><span class="nm">5)</span>THE <i>MITZVAH</i> OF HAVING CHILDREN</p>
<p class="bas indent1"><span class="nm">(a)</span><span class="cl">(Mishnah - Beis Shamai):</span> A man may not neglect having children unless he has children. He must have (at least) two sons;</p>
<p class="bas indent1"><span class="nm">(b)</span>Beis Hillel say, he must have a male and a female - "Male and female He created them."</p>
<p class="bas indent1"><span class="nm">(c)</span><span class="cl">(Gemara) Version #1:</span> If he has children he may neglect having children, but he should have a wife. This supports Rav Nachman;</p>
<p class="bas indent2"><span class="nm">1.</span><span class="cl">(Rav Nachman):</span> Even if a man has many children, he may not remain single - "It is not good that man be alone."</p>
<p class="bas indent1"><span class="nm">(d)</span><span class="cl">Version #2 - Inference:</span> If he has children, he may neglect having children and having a wife.</p>
<p class="bas indent1"><span class="nm">(e)</span><span class="cl">Question:</span> This refutes Rav Nachman!</p>
<p class="bas indent1"><span class="nm">(f)</span><span class="cl">Answer:</span> No. If he lacks children, he must marry a woman who can bear children. If he has children, he may marry a woman who cannot bear children.</p>
<p class="bas indent2"><span class="nm">1.</span>One should sell a Sefer Torah to marry a childbearing woman only if he lacks children.</p>
<p class="bas indent1"><span class="nm">(g)</span><span class="cl">(Mishnah - Beis Shamai):</span> He must have two sons.</p>
<p class="bas indent1"><span class="nm">(h)</span><span class="cl">Question:</span> What is Beis Shamai's source?</p>
<p class="bas indent1"><span class="nm">(i)</span><span class="cl">Answer:</span> They learn from Moshe - "Moshe's children were Gershom and Eliezer".</p>
<p class="bas indent2"><span class="nm">1.</span>Beis Hillel learn from the creation of the world (Adam and Chavah).</p>
<p class="bas indent1"><span class="nm">(j)</span><span class="cl">Question:</span> Why don't Beis Shamai learn from Creation?</p>
<p class="bas indent1"><span class="nm">(k)</span><span class="cl">Answer:</span> We do not learn about something possible (the Mitzvah of Peru u'Rvu) from something impossible (it was essential to have a male and a female at creation).</p>
