<p class="bas subject"><span class="nm">1)</span>DAVID'S SIN</p>
<p class="bas indent1"><span class="nm">(a)</span><span class="cl">(Rav Yehudah):</span> One should never bring himself to temptation. David brought himself to temptation and failed.</p>
<p class="bas indent2"><span class="nm">1.</span><span class="cl">David:</span> Why do we say Elokei Avraham, Elokei Yitzchak and Elokei Yakov, but not Elokei David? (Maharsha - he knew that even after he dies, Yisrael will not say this.)</p>
<p class="bas indent2"><span class="nm">2.</span><span class="cl">Hash-m:</span> I tested them, I did not test you.</p>
<p class="bas indent2"><span class="nm">3.</span><span class="cl">David:</span> "Bechaneni Hash-m v'Naseni (test me)"!</p>
<p class="bas indent2"><span class="nm">4.</span><span class="cl">Hash-m:</span> I did not tell them in what they will be tested, yet I will tell you. You will be tested in a matter of Ervah.</p>
<p class="bas indent1"><span class="nm">(b)</span><span class="cl">(Rav Yehudah):</span> "Va'Yhi l'Es ha'Erev va'Yakam David me'Al Mishkavo" - David had Bi'ah during the day (in order to satiate his Yetzer, and not think about women);</p>
<p class="bas indent2"><span class="nm">1.</span>He forgot that if one satiates the Ever, it craves more. If one starves it, it is satiated.</p>
<p class="bas indent1"><span class="nm">(c)</span>"Va'Yis'halech Al Gag... va'Yar Ishah Rochetzes" - Bas Sheva was shampooing her hair under a chest (Ramah - canopy). The Satan took the form of a bird. David shot an arrow at it. It broke the chest (lifted the canopy) and revealed her. David saw her.</p>
<p class="bas indent1"><span class="nm">(d)</span>David inquired, and was told that she was Uriyah's wife. He sent for her - "...va'Tavo Elav va'Yishkav Imah..."</p>
<p class="bas indent2"><span class="nm">1.</span>"Bachanta Libi... Tzeraftani Val Timtza" (You tested me, to refine me. I did not pass.)</p>
<p class="bas indent2"><span class="nm">2.</span>"Zamosi Bal Ya'avar Pi" - if only I had not asked to be tested!</p>
<p class="bas indent1"><span class="nm">(e)</span><span class="cl">(Rava):</span> "...Eich Tomru l'Nafshi Nudi Harchem Tzipor" - David asked Hash-m 'forgive me for the sin, lest people say that a bird toppled the mountain (king).'</p>
<p class="bas indent1"><span class="nm">(f)</span><span class="cl">(Rava):</span> "Lecha Levadcha Chotasi... Lema'an Titzdak b'Davrecha" - David told Hash-m 'You know that I could have overcome my Yetzer, just I did not want people to say that the slave (me) overcame his Master.'</p>
<p class="bas indent1"><span class="nm">(g)</span><span class="cl">(Rava):</span> "Ki Ani l'Tzela Nachon u'Mach'ovai Negdi Samid" - Bas Sheva was prepared for David from the six days of creation, just she came to him through great anguish.</p>
<p class="bas indent2"><span class="nm">1.</span><span class="cl">Support (Beraisa - Tana d'Vei R. Yishmael):</span> Bas Sheva was prepared for David from the six days of creation, just he took her before the proper time.</p>
<p class="bas indent1"><span class="nm">(h)</span><span class="cl">(Rava):</span> "...Kor'u v'Lo Damu" - David said, 'if I would be torn, my blood would not spill (because it drains from me when people shame me);'</p>
<p class="bas indent2"><span class="nm">1.</span>When my tormentors are learning the four Misos of Beis Din (some texts - Ohalos and Nega'im, i.e. difficult tractates unrelated to my sin; learning about Tzara'as should make one careful about Lashon ha'Ra), they stop learning to ask me which is the death penalty for Bi'ah with a married woman;</p>
<p class="bas indent2"><span class="nm">2.</span>I answer that it is choking, and he has a share in the world to come, but one who makes someone blush has no share in the world to come.</p>
<p class="bas indent1"><span class="nm">(i)</span><span class="cl">Rav Yehudah):</span> Even when David was sick, he fulfilled the Onah of his 18 wives - "Yagati b'Anchasi Ascheh b'Chol Laylah Mitasi."</p>
<p class="bas indent1"><span class="nm">(j)</span><span class="cl">(Rav Yehudah):</span> David thought to (Ramah - pretend to) serve idolatry - "va'Yhi David Ba Ad ha'Rosh Asher Yishtachaveh Sham l'Eilohim" - 'Rosh' refers to idolatry.</p>
<p class="bas indent1"><span class="nm">(k)</span>Chushai ha'Arki encountered David.</p>
<p class="bas indent2"><span class="nm">1.</span><span class="cl">Chushai:</span> Will people say that a king like yourself will serve idolatry?!</p>
<p class="bas indent2"><span class="nm">2.</span><span class="cl">David:</span> My son is about to kill me. People will think that Hash-m was not justified in doing this to me. It will be an open Chilul Hash-m. It is better that I (pretend to) serve idolatry!</p>
<p class="bas indent2"><span class="nm">3.</span><span class="cl">Chushai:</span> Why did you marry a Yafes To'ar (a beautiful woman taken in war)?</p>
<p class="bas indent2"><span class="nm">4.</span><span class="cl">David:</span> This is permitted!</p>
<p class="bas indent2"><span class="nm">5.</span><span class="cl">Chushai:</span> You did not expound that the Parshah of Ben Sorer u'Moreh is written right after it, to teach that one who marries a Yafes To'ar will have a Ben Sorer u'Moreh. (Therefore, people will not question Hash-m's ways.)</p>
<p class="bas indent1"><span class="nm">(l)</span><span class="cl">(R. Dostai of Biri):</span> David was like a Kusi merchant (who sells bit by bit. Likewise, David asked for forgiveness bit by bit);</p>
<p class="bas indent2"><span class="nm">1.</span><span class="cl">David:</span> "Shegi'os Mi Yavin (who can avoid sinning b'Shogeg)?"</p>
<p class="bas indent2"><span class="nm">2.</span><span class="cl">Hash-m:</span> I forgive to you (for Shogeg).</p>
<p class="bas indent2"><span class="nm">3.</span><span class="cl">David:</span> "Mi'Nistaros Nakeni" (cleanse me from intentional sins in private)!</p>
<p class="bas indent2"><span class="nm">4.</span><span class="cl">Hash-m:</span> I forgive to you.</p>
<p class="bas indent2"><span class="nm">5.</span><span class="cl">David:</span> (Also forgive) "Gam mi'Zedim..." (intentional sins in public).</p>
<p class="bas indent2"><span class="nm">6.</span><span class="cl">Hash-m:</span> I forgive to you.</p>
<p class="bas indent2"><span class="nm">7.</span><span class="cl">David:</span> "Al Yimshelu Vi (Chachamim should not expound my sin)"</p>
<p class="bas indent2"><span class="nm">8.</span><span class="cl">Hash-m:</span> I grant this.</p>
<p class="bas indent2"><span class="nm">9.</span><span class="cl">David:</span> "V'Nikeisi mi'Pesha Rav (my sin should not be written in Scripture)"</p>
<p class="bas indent2"><span class="nm">10.</span><span class="cl">Hash-m:</span> That is impossible. I removed a Yud from Sarai (when I changed her name to Sarah), and the Yud was complaining for hundreds of years until I added it to Hoshe'a (when I changed his name to Yehoshua). All the more so, I cannot omit an entire Parshah!</p>
<p class="bas indent1"><span class="nm">(m)</span>"V'Nikeisi mi'Pesha Rav" - David asked for total forgiveness.</p>
<p class="bas indent2"><span class="nm">1.</span><span class="cl">Hash-m:</span> Your son Shlomo will write "...ha'Ba El Eshes Re'ehu Lo Yinakeh Kol ha'Noge'a Bah"!</p>
<p class="bas indent2"><span class="nm">2.</span><span class="cl">David:</span> Will I be forever plagued by this sin?</p>
<p class="bas indent2"><span class="nm">3.</span><span class="cl">Hash-m:</span> Accept on yourself afflictions. (He did.)</p>
<p class="bas indent1"><span class="nm">(n)</span><span class="cl">(Rav Yehudah):</span> David was a Metzora for six months. "Techat'eni v'Ezov (purify me with hyssop, which is used to be Metaher Metzora'im) v'Etaher";</p>
<p class="bas indent2"><span class="nm">1.</span>The Shechinah departed from him - "Hashivah Li Seson Yish'echa v'Ru'ach Nedivah Sismecheni";</p>
<p class="bas indent2"><span class="nm">2.</span>The Sanhedrin separated from him - "Yashuvu Li Yera'echa."</p>
<p class="bas indent1"><span class="nm">(o)</span><span class="cl">Question:</span> What is the source that this was for six months?</p>
<p class="bas indent1"><span class="nm">(p)</span><span class="cl">Answer - contradiction:</span> It says "b'Chevron Molach Sheva Shanim", and it says "b'Chevron Molach Al Yehudah Sheva Shanim v'Shishah Chodoshim"!</p>
<p class="bas bbbline">107b----------------------------------------107b</p>
<p class="bas indent2"><span class="nm">1.</span><span class="cl">Resolution:</span> The first verse does not count the six months that he was a Metzora.</p>
<p class="bas indent1"><span class="nm">(q)</span><span class="cl">David:</span> Forgive to me for the sin!</p>
<p class="bas indent1"><span class="nm">(r)</span><span class="cl">Hash-m:</span> I forgive to you.</p>
<p class="bas indent1"><span class="nm">(s)</span><span class="cl">David:</span> "Asei Imi Os l'Tovah va'Yir'u Son'ai v'Yevoshu (make a sign to show this, so my enemies will be embarrassed)"!</p>
<p class="bas indent1"><span class="nm">(t)</span><span class="cl">Hash-m:</span> I will not do so in your lifetime, rather, in your son's day.</p>
<p class="bas indent2"><span class="nm">1.</span>When Shlomo built the Beis ha'Mikdash and wanted to bring the Aron into the Kodesh ha'Kodoshim, the gates clung to each other and would not let it enter. Shlomo sang 24 praises to Hash-m; they remained closed.</p>
<p class="bas indent2"><span class="nm">2.</span>He said "Se'u She'arim Rosheichem..." - they remained closed.</p>
<p class="bas indent2"><span class="nm">3.</span>When he said "Zochrah l'Chasdei David Avdecha", they opened. The faces of David's enemies turned black (from shame). All knew that Hash-m forgave David.</p>
<p class="bas subject"><span class="nm">2)</span>GECHAZI</p>
<p class="bas indent1"><span class="nm">(a)</span>We learn that Gechazi has no share in the world to come from "va'Yelech Elisha Dameshek";</p>
<p class="bas indent1"><span class="nm">(b)</span><span class="cl">Question:</span> Why did Elisha go there?</p>
<p class="bas indent1"><span class="nm">(c)</span><span class="cl">Answer:</span> He went to get Gechazi to do Teshuvah. He did not succeed.</p>
<p class="bas indent2"><span class="nm">1.</span><span class="cl">Elisha:</span> Do Teshuvah!</p>
<p class="bas indent2"><span class="nm">2.</span><span class="cl">Gechazi:</span> You taught me that if one sins and makes others sin, Hash-m does not allow him to repent.</p>
<p class="bas indent3"><span class="nm">i.</span><span class="cl">Question:</span> How did he make others sin?</p>
<p class="bas indent3"><span class="nm">ii.</span><span class="cl">Answer #1:</span> He used magnets to suspend Yarav'am's idols in mid-air (making people think that they have power).</p>
<p class="bas indent3"><span class="nm">iii.</span><span class="cl">Answer #2:</span> He carved a name of Hash-m on the idol's mouth. It would say the first two of the 10 utterances (and people thought that the idol was declaring "Anochi Hash-m...")</p>
<p class="bas indent3"><span class="nm">iv.</span><span class="cl">Answer #3:</span> He expelled Rabanan from learning from Elisha - "ha'Makom... Tzar Mimenu." (After Gechazi left, the Talmidim were crowded. Before this, there were less Talmidim, and there was enough room.)</p>
<p class="bas indent1"><span class="nm">(d)</span><span class="cl">(Beraisa):</span> One should repel with the left hand, and draw close with the right hand, unlike Elisha, who repelled Gechazi with both hands;</p>
<p class="bas indent2"><span class="nm">1.</span><span class="cl">Question:</span> Why does it say "va'Yomer (Gechazi) Lo Holach Avdecha... va'Yomer Elav (Elisha)... ha'Es Lokachas Es ha'Kesef v'Lokachas Begadim v'Zeisim u'Chramim v'Tzon u'Vakar v'Avadim u'Shfachos"? Gechazi took only money and clothes!</p>
<p class="bas indent2"><span class="nm">2.</span><span class="cl">Answer (R. Yitzchak):</span> At the time, Elisha was teaching about the eight Sheratzim (rodents). Na'aman, the head general of Aram, had Tzara'as. A girl taken captive from Eretz Yisrael told him that Elisha would be able to cure him.</p>
<p class="bas indent2"><span class="nm">3.</span>Elisha told him to immerse seven times in the Yarden. Na'aman thought that he was mocking him, but the people he was with convinced him to try it. It worked. He wanted to give Elisha everything he had with him, but Elisha refused to take. Na'aman left. Gechazi slipped away, caught up with Na'aman, (lied and said that Elisha reconsidered) and took a gift from Na'aman. When he returned, Elisha saw that Na'aman's Tzara'as was on Gechazi.</p>
<p class="bas indent2"><span class="nm">4.</span><span class="cl">Elisha:</span> Rasha! The time has come for you to receive your reward for learning about the eight Sheratzim (and all your Torah, in this world, and not in the world to come. This is why Elisha mentioned eight things.) The Tzara'as of Na'aman should cling to you and your children forever!</p>
<p class="bas indent2"><span class="nm">5.</span>Gechazi left. His Tzara'as was snow-white.</p>
<p class="bas indent1"><span class="nm">(e)</span><span class="cl">(R. Yochanan):</span> "Arba'ah Anashim Hayu Metzora'im" - these were Gechazi and his three sons.</p>
<p class="bas indent1"><span class="nm">(f)</span><span class="cl">(Beraisa - R. Shimon ben Elazar):</span> Three things should be repelled with the left hand, and drawn close with the right - the Yetzer ha'Ra, a child, and a wife.</p>
<p class="bas indent1"><span class="nm">(g)</span><span class="cl">(Beraisa):</span> Elisha fell sick three times - "(1) Ve'Elisha Cholah (2) Es Chalyo (3) Asher Yamus Bo";</p>
<p class="bas indent2"><span class="nm">1.</span>These were for causing bears to ravage youths (who had mocked him), for repelling Gechazi with both hands, and the sickness he died from .</p>
<p class="bas indent1"><span class="nm">(h)</span>Until Avraham, there were no visible signs of old age. People would see Avraham and think that hei is Yitzchak (and vice-versa, because they looked the same). Avraham prayed for a solution, and Hash-m agreed - "v'Avraham Zaken Ba ba'Yamim."</p>
<p class="bas indent2"><span class="nm">1.</span>Until Yakov, there was no weakness (shortly before death. People did not know when to command or bless their children). Yakov prayed for a solution, and Hash-m agreed - "va'Yomer l'Yosef Hinei Avicha Choleh."</p>
<p class="bas indent2"><span class="nm">2.</span>Until Elisha, no one ever recovered from weakness (it came only shortly before death). He prayed, and recovered - "Chalyo Asher Yamus Bo" implies that he was sick other times (and recovered).</p>
<p class="bas subject"><span class="nm">3)</span>GENERATIONS WITH NO SHARE IN THE WORLD TO COME</p>
<p class="bas indent1"><span class="nm">(a)</span><span class="cl">(Mishnah):</span> The Dor ha'Mabul (generation of the flood) has no share in the world to come, and they will not be judged (Ramah - for they already received their punishment, the flood) - "Lo Yadun Ruchi va'Adam l'Olam" - there will be neither Din (judgment) nor Ru'ach;</p>
