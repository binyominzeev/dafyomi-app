<p class="bas indent1"><span class="nm">(a)</span><span class="cl">(Rav Ila):</span> If one ate (outside Yerushalayim) Ma'aser (Sheni) of grain, wine and oil, he is lashed three times.</p>

<p class="bas indent1"><span class="nm">(c)</span><span class="cl">Answer:</span> Here is different, for there are extra words in the verse:</p>
<p class="bas indent2"><span class="nm">1.</span>"V'Achalta <i>Lifnei Hash-m</i> Elokecha Ma'asar Degancha v'Siroshcha v'Yitzharecha" teaches that you must eat inside (Yerushalayim), and not outside;</p>

<p class="bas indent1"><span class="nm">(i)</span><span class="cl">Rejection:</span> We could not learn bread from Kali, for grain was changed to make bread, but Kali is intact;</p>

<p class="bas indent1"><span class="nm">(n)</span><span class="cl">Question:</span> We should say that one is lashed for Kali by itself, for it is extra, and one is lashed only once for both bread and Karmel, since there is nothing to be Mechalek them!</p>
<p class="bas indent1"><span class="nm">(o)</span><span class="cl">Answer:</span> If so, the Torah should have written Kali at the beginning or end;</p>
<p class="bas indent2"><span class="nm">1.</span>Rather, it wrote Kali in the middle, to teach that the others are like it, and one is lashed for each one by itself.</p>

<p class="bas indent1"><span class="nm">(a)</span><span class="cl">(R. Yanai):</span> Do not belittle Gezeirah Shavah. (Kares for eating) Pigul is among Gufei (vital laws of) Torah, yet we know this only from a Gezeirah Shavah!</p>
<p class="bas indent2"><span class="nm">1.</span><span class="cl">(R. Yochanan):</span> It says (regarding Nosar) "v'Ochlav Avono Yisa (... v'Nichresah)," and it says regarding Pigul "veha'Nefesh ha'Ocheles Mimenu Avonah Tisa";</p>
<p class="bas indent2"><span class="nm">2.</span>Just like there is Kares for (eating) Nosar, also for Pigul.</p>
<p class="bas indent1"><span class="nm">(b)</span><span class="cl">(R. Simai):</span> Do not belittle Gezeirah Shavah. Nosar is among Gufei Torah, yet we know Kares for eating it only from a Gezeirah Shavah! ("V'Ochlav... " does not explicitly mention Nosar. If not for a Gezeirah Shavah, we would think that it refers to Pigul, mentioned in the previous verse.)</p>
<p class="bas indent2"><span class="nm">1.</span>It says "v'Ochlav Avono Yisa Ki Kodesh Hash-m Chilel," and it says "v'Sorafta Es ha'Nosar ba'Esh... Ki Kodesh". Just like the latter refers to Nosar, also the former.</p>
<p class="bas indent1"><span class="nm">(c)</span><span class="cl">(Abaye):</span> Do not belittle Gezeirah Shavah. (Death through burning for relations with) one's daughter from a woman he raped (or enticed) is among Gufei Torah, yet we know it only from a Gezeirah Shavah!</p>
<p class="bas indent2"><span class="nm">1.</span><span class="cl">(Rava):</span> The Gezeirah Shavah "Henah-Henah" forbids a man to his daughter (not from his wife). "Zimah-Zimah" teaches that he is burned for relations with her.</p>
<p class="bas indent1"><span class="nm">(d)</span><span class="cl">(Rav Ashi):</span> Do not belittle Gezeirah Shavah. Death through stoning is among Gufei Torah, yet (in most cases) we know Sekilah only from a Gezeirah Shavah!</p>
<p class="bas indent2"><span class="nm">1.</span>It says "Demeihem Bam" (regarding most Chayavei Sekilah), just like it says regarding Ov and Yid'oni (conjuring up the dead), which are Chayavei Sekilah.</p>

<p class="bas indent1"><span class="nm">(a)</span><span class="cl">(Mishnah):</span> One who scents oil (just like Shemen ha'Mishchah).</p>
<p class="bas indent1"><span class="nm">(b)</span><span class="cl">(Beraisa):</span> If one scents oil (like Shemen ha'Mishchah) in order to learn or to give it to the Tzibur, he is exempt;</p>
<p class="bas indent2"><span class="nm">1.</span>If he did so to anoint, he is liable.</p>
<p class="bas indent2"><span class="nm">2.</span>One is exempt for anointing with it. Liability for anointing is only with Moshe's oil.</p>
<p class="bas indent1"><span class="nm">(c)</span><span class="cl">Question:</span> What is the source to exempt for scenting oil in order to learn or to give to the Tzibur?</p>
<p class="bas indent1"><span class="nm">(d)</span><span class="cl">Answer:</span> We learn from a Gezeirah Shavah "Maskunto-Maskunto" from Ketores;</p>
<p class="bas indent2"><span class="nm">1.</span>Regarding Ketores it says "Lo Sa'asu Lachem". One may not make Ketores (just like that offered to Hash-m, and one is liable for this) for yourselves, but one who makes it to give to the Tzibur is exempt. The same applies to Shemen ha'Mishchah.</p>
<p class="bas indent1"><span class="nm">(e)</span><span class="cl">Question:</span> We should learn about Ketores from Shemen ha'Mishchah!</p>
<p class="bas indent2"><span class="nm">1.</span>Just like one who makes a half-Shi'ur of Shemen ha'Mishchah (only six Lugim) is exempt, one who makes a half-Shi'ur of Ketores should be exempt!</p>
<p class="bas indent2"><span class="nm">2.</span>However, Rava taught that one who makes a half-Shi'ur of Ketores is liable, but one who makes a half-Shi'ur of Shemen ha'Mishchah is exempt!</p>
<p class="bas indent1"><span class="nm">(f)</span><span class="cl">Answer:</span> Regarding Shemen ha'Mishchah it says "uv'Maskunto Lo Sa'asu <i>Kamohu.</i>" Only making the same amount is forbidden;</p>
<p class="bas indent2"><span class="nm">1.</span>Regarding Ketores it says "veha'Ketores Asher Ta'aseh" - whatever one makes (that is valid for Haktarah) is forbidden, and one may offer half a Maneh in the morning and half in the evening. (Shitah Mekubetzes - this is the norm, but even a k'Zayis is considered Haktarah, so one is liable for making a k'Zayis.)	(A Maneh is the weight of 9600 barley seeds, less than half a kilogram.)</p>
<p class="bas indent1"><span class="nm">(g)</span><span class="cl">(Beraisa):</span> The spices used to scent Shemen ha'Mishchah - 500 Manos of Mor Deror (myrrh, a tree resin; some say that it is musk), 500 Manos of Kidah (cassia (tree bark) or costus (Kosht, the root of an herb), 500 Manos of Kineman Besem (cinnamon; some say aloeswood), and 250 Manos of Keneh Vosem (fragrant cane - some say that this is sweet calamus), 1750 Manos in all.</p>
<p class="bas indent1"><span class="nm">(h)</span><span class="cl">Question:</span> Does the Tana come to teach arithmetic?!</p>
<p class="bas indent1"><span class="nm">(i)</span><span class="cl">Answer:</span> (It says "... v'Kinman Besem Machatziso Chamishim u'Masayim u'Keneh Bosem Chamishim u'Masayim.") One might have thought that the Shi'ur of Keneh Vosem should be two weighings of 250 Manos each, just like cinnamon, the total weight of the spices would be 2000 Manos. The Tana teaches that this is not so.</p>
<p class="bas indent1"><span class="nm">(j)</span><span class="cl">Question:</span> Why don't we say so?</p>
<p class="bas indent1"><span class="nm">(k)</span><span class="cl">Answer:</span> If so, the Torah would have written "v'Kinman Besem u'Keneh Bosem Mechtzah u'Mechtzah Chamishim u'Masayim."</p>
<p class="bas indent1"><span class="nm">(l)</span><span class="cl">Question (Rav Papa):</span> Are the spices weighed evenly (with the weight on the other side of the balance scale), or with Hechra (the pan with the spices must be lower)?</p>
<p class="bas indent1"><span class="nm">(m)</span><span class="cl">Answer (Abaye):</span> The Torah says "Bad b'Vad," the weights must be even!</p>
<p class="bas indent1"><span class="nm">(n)</span><span class="cl">Objection (and Answer #2 - Rav Papa):</span> Rav Yehudah taught that Hash-m knows about (i.e. desires the extra weight needed for) Hechra (therefore, he commanded to weigh with Hechra)!</p>
<p class="bas indent2"><span class="nm">1.</span><span class="cl">(Rav Yehudah):</span> Why does the Torah command to weigh the 500 Manos of cinnamon half at a time, and not all at once?</p>
<p class="bas indent2"><span class="nm">2.</span><span class="cl">Answer:</span> This is in order that there will be two Hachra'os. Hash-m desires Hechra.</p>
<p class="bas indent1"><span class="nm">(o)</span><span class="cl">Question:</span> What do we learn from "Bad b'Vad"?</p>
<p class="bas indent1"><span class="nm">(p)</span><span class="cl">Answer (Ravina):</span> The spices must be weighed against weights, and not against spices (which were already weighed against weights).</p>
<p class="bas indent1"><span class="nm">(q)</span><span class="cl">(Beraisa - R. Yehudah):</span> To make the Shemen ha'Mishchah, Moshe cooked oil with the spices.</p>
<p class="bas indent2"><span class="nm">1.</span><span class="cl">R. Yosi:</span> A Hin (about six liters) of oil is not enough even to rub on the spices! (It is not even a hundredth of the volume of the spices - <b>PF</b>.)</p>
<p class="bas indent2"><span class="nm">2.</span><span class="cl">Version #1 (Our text, Rambam):</span> Rather, he cooked the spices in water. It absorbed the scent. He added the oil, and boiled away the water.</p>
<p class="bas indent2"><span class="nm">3.</span><span class="cl">Version #2 (Rashi):</span> Rather, he soaked the spices in water (to saturate them, so they would not absorb the oil), then put oil on the spices to absorb the scent, and then removed the oil.</p>
<p class="bas indent2"><span class="nm">4.</span><span class="cl">R. Yehudah:</span> There were many miracles with the Shemen ha'Mishchah! (We can say that another miracle was that the oil was not absorbed in the spices.)</p>
