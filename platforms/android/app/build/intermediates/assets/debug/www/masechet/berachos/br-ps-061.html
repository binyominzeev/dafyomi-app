<p class="bas indent1"><span class="nm">(a)</span><span class="cl">(Rav Huna):</span> A person should say few words in front of Hash-m (Maharsha - he should not pray excessively for relief from his afflictions, speak about them or question His ways) - "Al Tevahel Al Picha v'Libcha Al Yemaher... Yiheyu Devarecha Me'atim."</p>
<p class="bas indent1"><span class="nm">(b)</span><span class="cl">Question (Rav Nachman bar Rav Chisda):</span> Why are there two letters Yud in "va'Yitzer Hash-m Elokim Es ha'Adam"?</p>
<p class="bas indent1"><span class="nm">(c)</span><span class="cl">Answer #1 (Rav Nachman bar Rav Chisda):</span> This teaches that man was created with two Yetzarim (inclinations), the Yetzer Tov and Yetzer ha'Ra.</p>
<p class="bas indent1"><span class="nm">(d)</span>(However, Rashi to Bereishis 2:25 and Yeshayah 5:2-7 says that before eating from the Etz ha'Da'as, Adam did not have a Yetzer ha'Ra! We can answer according to Nefesh ha'Chayim (1:6, Hagah DH veha'Inyan)- his Yetzer ha'Ra was not an internal Yetzer ha'Ra; it was external (in the Nachash). Also, at first, each Yetzer was separate; after eating from the Etz ha'Da'as they became mixed.)</p>
<p class="bas indent1"><span class="nm">(e)</span><span class="cl">Objection (Rav Nachman bar Yitzchak):</span> Regarding animals, "va'Yitzer" has only one Yud -- will we say that they lack a Yetzer ha'Ra?! We see that they damage, bite and kick! (Rashash - we know that they have a Yetzer Tov, for they work for man.)</p>
<p class="bas indent1"><span class="nm">(f)</span><span class="cl">Answer #2 (R. Shimon ben Pazi):</span> (The two Yuds allude to two ways to read the word:) Woe to me from Yotzri (Hash-m, "the One who formed me," if I succumb to Yitzri, my Yetzer ha'Ra); woe to me from Yitzri (my Yetzer ha'Ra will torment me if I obey Yotzri, the One who formed me).</p>
<p class="bas indent1"><span class="nm">(g)</span><span class="cl">Answer #3 (R. Yirmeyah ben Elazar):</span> Hash-m created Adam with two Partzufim -- "Achor va'Kedem Tzartani" (the bodily form of his back resembled his front).</p>
<p class="bas indent1"><span class="nm">(h)</span><span class="cl">(Rav or Shmuel):</span> "Va'Yiven Hash-m Elokim Es <i>ha'Tzela</i>" -- Chavah was formed from one Partzuf of Adam;</p>
<p class="bas indent1"><span class="nm">(i)</span><span class="cl">(The other of Rav and Shmuel):</span> She was formed from a tail (with which Adam was created).</p>
<p class="bas indent1"><span class="nm">(j)</span><span class="cl">Question:</span> According to the first opinion, we understand "Achor va'Kedem Tzartani"; according to the latter opinion, what does it mean?</p>
<p class="bas indent1"><span class="nm">(k)</span><span class="cl">Answer (R. Ami):</span> Adam was Achor (the last) of Creation, he was Kedem (first) to be punished.</p>
<p class="bas indent1"><span class="nm">(l)</span><span class="cl">Question:</span> We understand that he was the last of Creation, as he was created on Erev Shabbos; in what sense was he first to be punished?</p>
<p class="bas indent2"><span class="nm">1.</span><span class="cl">Suggestion:</span> He was first to be punished for the sin [of eating from the Etz ha'Da'as] due to the snake.</p>
<p class="bas indent2"><span class="nm">2.</span><span class="cl">Rejection (Beraisa - Rebbi):</span> When giving grandeur, we begin with the most important -- "va'Yedaber Moshe El Aharon v'El Elazar v'El Isamar..."</p>
<p class="bas indent3"><span class="nm">i.</span>When punishing or cursing, we begin with the least important -- first the snake was cursed, then Chavah, then Adam.</p>
<p class="bas indent1"><span class="nm">(m)</span><span class="cl">Answer:</span> Man was punished first in the flood, before animals -- "va'Yimach... me'Adam v'Ad Behemah."</p>
<p class="bas indent1"><span class="nm">(n)</span><span class="cl">Question:</span> According to the first opinion (Chavah was formed from a Partzuf), we understand the two Yuds in "va'Yitzer";</p>
<p class="bas indent2"><span class="nm">1.</span>According to the latter opinion, why are there two Yuds?</p>
<p class="bas indent1"><span class="nm">(o)</span><span class="cl">Answer:</span> It teaches like R. Shimon ben Pazi: "Woe to me from Yotzri..."</p>
<p class="bas indent1"><span class="nm">(p)</span><span class="cl">Question:</span> According to the first opinion, we understand "Zachar u'Nekevah Bera'am" (one Partzuf was male, the other female);</p>
<p class="bas indent2"><span class="nm">1.</span>According to the latter opinion, how can we explain this?</p>
<p class="bas indent1"><span class="nm">(q)</span><span class="cl">Answer - contradiction (R. Avahu):</span> It says "Zachar u'Nekevah Bera'am," and it says "Ki b'Tzelem Elokim Asah Es ha'Adam," implying that he was a single creation!</p>
<p class="bas indent2"><span class="nm">1.</span><span class="cl">Resolution:</span> Hash-m had intent to create two, but He actually created only one.</p>
<p class="bas indent1"><span class="nm">(r)</span><span class="cl">Question:</span> According the first opinion, we understand "va'Yisgor Basar Tachtenah" (He put skin in place of the removed Partzuf); according to the latter opinion, how can we explain this?</p>
<p class="bas indent1"><span class="nm">(s)</span><span class="cl">Answer (R. Yirmeyah):</span> He covered up the place where he cut [off the tail].</p>
<p class="bas subject"><span class="nm">2)</span>WE DO NOT WALK BEHIND A WOMAN</p>
<p class="bas indent1"><span class="nm">(a)</span><span class="cl">Question:</span> According the latter opinion, we understand "va'Yiven" (a tail was made into a person); according to the first opinion, Chavah was already made!</p>
<p class="bas indent1"><span class="nm">(b)</span><span class="cl">Answer #1 (R. Shimon ben Menasiya):</span> Hash-m braided Chavah's hair and brought her to Adam;</p>
<p class="bas indent2"><span class="nm">1.</span>Braiding is called "Binyan" in the language of certain islands.</p>
<p class="bas indent1"><span class="nm">(c)</span><span class="cl">Answer #2 (Rav Chisda):</span> Hash-m built her like a storehouse, wide at the bottom and narrow on top, in order to hold a fetus.</p>
<p class="bas indent1"><span class="nm">(d)</span><span class="cl">(R. Yirmeyah ben Elazar):</span> "Va'Yevi'eha El ha'Adam" -- Hash-m was like a Shushbin (a dear friend who helps make a wedding) to Adam;</p>
<p class="bas indent2"><span class="nm">1.</span>This teaches proper conduct -- someone important should not scorn being a Shushbin for someone less important.</p>
<p class="bas indent1"><span class="nm">(e)</span><span class="cl">Question:</span> According to the opinion that there were two Partzufim, which one faced forward (the direction in which Adam walked)?</p>
<p class="bas indent1"><span class="nm">(f)</span><span class="cl">Answer (Rav Nachman bar Yitzchak):</span> Presumably, the male faced forward:</p>
<p class="bas indent2"><span class="nm">1.</span><span class="cl">(Beraisa):</span> One should not walk in back of a woman on the road, even one's wife;</p>
<p class="bas indent2"><span class="nm">2.</span>(Rashi - it is disgraceful (Maharsha - he is more important; Einayim l'Mishpat - perhaps people do not know that she is his wife); Radvaz - if he is close enough to notice her movements, it is forbidden, lest it arouse his lust. Be'er Heitev - some permit walking more than four Amos in back of her.)</p>
<p class="bas indent2"><span class="nm">3.</span>If he encounters a woman (Rashi - a married woman; the other Poskim do not distinguish between married and unmarried) in front of him on a bridge, he should go to her side until he passes.</p>
<p class="bas indent2"><span class="nm">4.</span>Anyone who (Tosfos - regularly) goes in back of a (Rashi - married) woman while crossing a river has no share in the World to Come (she lifts up her clothing so it will not get wet, he will see).</p>
<p class="bas indent1"><span class="nm">(g)</span><span class="cl">(Beraisa):</span> If one counts out coins to a woman in order to look at her, even if he has [the merit of] Torah and Mitzvos like Moshe, he will not be spared from Gehinom -- "Yad l'Yad Lo Yinakeh Ra."</p>
<p class="bas indent1"><span class="nm">(h)</span><span class="cl">(Rav Nachman):</span> Mano'ach (Shimshon's father) was an ignoramus -- "va'Yelech Mano'ach Acharei Ishto" (he walked behind his wife).</p>
<p class="bas indent1"><span class="nm">(i)</span><span class="cl">Objection (Rav Nachman bar Yitzchak):</span> It also says, "va'Yakam va'Yelech Achareha" (and "va'Yelech Elkanah Acharei Ishto") -- you cannot say that Elisha (or Elkanah) was unlearned! (Tosfos deletes what is in brackets, for there is no such verse. Maharshal - regarding Pilegesh b'Giv'ah it says, "va'Yakam Ishah va'Yelech Achareha" -- the Gemara misquotes the verse to as referring to Elkanah. Maharsha - the Gemara is referring to the verse, "va'Yelech Elkanah ha'Ramasah Al Beiso," which implies that he walked after his wife.)</p>
<p class="bas indent2"><span class="nm">1.</span>Regarding Elisha (and Elkanah), you must say that it means that he "went after her words and counsel" -- the same applies to Mano'ach.</p>
<p class="bas indent1"><span class="nm">(j)</span><span class="cl">(Rav Ashi):</span> According to Rav Nachman's understanding, Mano'ach did not even learn Chumash [properly] -- "va'Takam Rivkah v'Na'aroseha... va'Telachnah <i>Acharei ha'Ish</i>," not in front of him (Eliezer).</p>
<p class="bas indent1"><span class="nm">(k)</span><span class="cl">(R. Yochanan):</span> It is better to walk in back of a lion than in back of a woman;</p>
<p class="bas indent2"><span class="nm">1.</span>It is better to walk in back of a woman than in back of a Nochri (Maharsha - lest he be lured to serve idolatry; Einayin l'Mishpat - lest the Nochri kill him);</p>
<p class="bas indent2"><span class="nm">2.</span>It is better to walk in back of a Nochri than in back of a synagogue when the congregation is praying (for it looks as though he does not want to pray with them; Maharsha - it looks like heresy);</p>
<p class="bas indent3"><span class="nm">i.</span>Going in back of a synagogue is forbidden only if the following conditions are met: he is not carrying a load, there is no other entrance, he is not riding a donkey, and he is not wearing Tefilin (if even one of these is not met, people understand why he does not enter to pray, or will see that the fear of Heaven is upon him).</p>
<p class="bas subject"><span class="nm">3)</span>FUNCTIONS OF THE ORGANS</p>
<p class="bas indent1"><span class="nm">(a)</span><span class="cl">(Rav):</span> The Yetzer ha'Ra is like a fly (a tiny creature that spoils great things), it sits between the two chambers of the heart -- "Zevuvei Maves Yav'ish Yabi'a Shemen Roke'ach";</p>
<p class="bas indent1"><span class="nm">(b)</span>(Etz Yosef, citing Nefesh ha'Chayim - the Yetzer Tov is always in the right chamber, the Yetzer ha'Ra is normally in the left, but sometimes switches, giving counsel that looks virtuous but is really evil.)</p>
<p class="bas indent1"><span class="nm">(c)</span><span class="cl">(Shmuel):</span> It is like a wheat kernel -- "la'Pesach Chatas Rovetz" ("Chatas" is similar to the word "Chitah").</p>
<p class="bas indent1"><span class="nm">(d)</span><span class="cl">(Beraisa):</span> A person has two kidneys -- one counsels to do good, the other for evil;</p>
<p class="bas indent1"><span class="nm">(e)</span>Presumably, the good counselor is on the right, the bad on the left -- "Lev Chacham li'Yemino v'Lev Kesil li'Smolo."</p>
<p class="bas indent1"><span class="nm">(f)</span><span class="cl">(Beraisa):</span> The kidneys counsel, the heart understands (whether or not to accept the counsel), the tongue articulates words, the mouth emits them, the esophagus takes in and discharges all kinds of food, the windpipe emits voice;</p>
<p class="bas bbbline">61b----------------------------------------61b</p>
<p class="bas indent1"><span class="nm">(g)</span>The lungs absorb liquids (from the stomach; (Gra (YD 36:2) - this is why some say that a hole in each membrane (even in different places) makes a Tereifah, just as it does in the esophagus);</p>
<p class="bas indent1"><span class="nm">(h)</span>The liver gets angry, the gall bladder shoots a drop [of bile] at it to calm it;</p>
<p class="bas indent1"><span class="nm">(i)</span>The spleen jests, the crop (a stomach in birds) grinds;</p>
<p class="bas indent1"><span class="nm">(j)</span>The stomach causes sleep, the nose awakens; if they reverse their roles, a person deteriorates and dies.</p>
<p class="bas indent1"><span class="nm">(k)</span><span class="cl">(Beraisa):</span> If both cause sleep or both awaken, one dies immediately.</p>
<p class="bas indent1"><span class="nm">(l)</span><span class="cl">(Beraisa - R. Yosi ha'Glili):</span> Tzadikim are ruled by their Yetzer Tov -- "v'Libi Chalal b'Kirbi" (David said, it is as if I have no Yetzer ha'Ra, for I can overcome it);</p>
<p class="bas indent2"><span class="nm">1.</span>Resha'im are ruled by their Yetzer ha'Ra -- "Ne'um Pesha la'Rasha b'Kerev Libi Ein Pachad Elokim l'Neged Einav" (it tells them not to fear Hash-m);</p>
<p class="bas indent2"><span class="nm">2.</span>Intermediate people are ruled by both -- "Ya'amod li'Min Evyon Lehoshi'a mi'<i>Shoftei</i> Nafsho" (he has two rulers).</p>
<p class="bas indent1"><span class="nm">(m)</span><span class="cl">(Rabah):</span> People like us are intermediate.</p>
<p class="bas indent1"><span class="nm">(n)</span><span class="cl">(Abaye):</span> If so, no one is a Tzadik nowadays!</p>
<p class="bas indent1"><span class="nm">(o)</span><span class="cl">(Rava):</span> [Pleasure in] this world is only for absolute Tzadikim and absolute Resha'im (the latter are paid for all their merits in this world, for they have no share in the World to Come. Maharsha deletes this teaching, for the following teaching is Rabah's response to Abaye.)</p>
<p class="bas indent1"><span class="nm">(p)</span><span class="cl">(Rava):</span> A person himself knows whether or not he is an absolute Tzadik. (Maharsha - Rabah's humility did not allow him to call himself a Tzadik.)</p>
<p class="bas indent1"><span class="nm">(q)</span><span class="cl">(Rav):</span> The world was created for [people like] Ach'av and R. Chanina ben Dosa:</p>
<p class="bas indent2"><span class="nm">1.</span>Ach'av received [awesome wealth] in this world, R. Chanina ben Dosa receives awesome reward in the World to Come.</p>
<p class="bas subject"><span class="nm">4)</span>B'CHOL NAFSHECHA</p>
<p class="bas indent1"><span class="nm">(a)</span><span class="cl">(Mishnah):</span> For it says "v'Ahavta Es Hash-m Elokecha..."</p>
<p class="bas indent1"><span class="nm">(b)</span><span class="cl">(Beraisa - R. Eliezer) Question:</span> Why must it say both "uv'Chol Nafshecha" and "uv'Chol Me'odecha"?</p>
<p class="bas indent1"><span class="nm">(c)</span><span class="cl">Answer:</span> [Even] if a person's life is more dear to him than his money, he must love Hash-m with all his life (and be ready to give up his life if required to do so); [even] if his money is more dear to him than his life, he must love Hash-m with all his money.</p>
<p class="bas indent1"><span class="nm">(d)</span>R. Akiva says, "uv'Chol Nafshecha" teaches that one must love Hash-m even when He takes your life.</p>
<p class="bas indent1"><span class="nm">(e)</span><span class="cl">(Beraisa):</span> The kingdom (Rome) once decreed that the Jews may not learn Torah; Papus ben Yehudah found R. Akiva gathering multitudes and teaching Torah.</p>
<p class="bas indent2"><span class="nm">1.</span><span class="cl">Papus:</span> Are you not afraid of the kingdom?!</p>
<p class="bas indent2"><span class="nm">2.</span><span class="cl">R. Akiva:</span> I shall give you a parable. A fox was walking next to the river and saw schools of fish frenziedly fleeing from place to place. He asked them why they flee.</p>
<p class="bas indent2"><span class="nm">3.</span><span class="cl">The fish:</span> We flee from nets that people set to catch us!</p>
<p class="bas indent2"><span class="nm">4.</span><span class="cl">The fox:</span> Would you like to come up on the dry land, and we will live together like my ancestors dwelled with yours?</p>
<p class="bas indent2"><span class="nm">5.</span><span class="cl">The fish:</span> You are reputed to be the cleverest animal, yet you are the most foolish! We are afraid even in the place where we can live, all the more so in the place where we die!</p>
<p class="bas indent2"><span class="nm">6.</span><span class="cl">R. Akiva:</span> The same applies to us. Now, when we engage in Torah about which it says, "Ki Hu Chayecha v'Orech Yomecha," we are in danger -- if we would cease to learn, all the more so!</p>
<p class="bas indent2"><span class="nm">7.</span>Shortly after this, R. Akiva was imprisoned; Papus was also imprisoned and was quartered near R. Akiva.</p>
<p class="bas indent2"><span class="nm">8.</span><span class="cl">R. Akiva:</span> Why were you taken?</p>
<p class="bas indent2"><span class="nm">9.</span><span class="cl">Papus:</span> You are fortunate, you were taken for engaging in Torah; woe to me, I was taken for worthless things!</p>
<p class="bas indent1"><span class="nm">(f)</span>When R. Akiva was taken to be executed, it was the time for Keri'as Shema; they were tearing off his skin with iron combs, he was accepting upon himself Ol Malchus Shamayim.</p>
<p class="bas indent1"><span class="nm">(g)</span><span class="cl">His Talmidim:</span> Rebbi, to this extent?! (You are able to do so even amidst such pain?!)</p>
<p class="bas indent1"><span class="nm">(h)</span><span class="cl">R. Akiva:</span> My entire life I was troubled by the verse "uv'Chol Nafshecha," even when He takes your life -- when would I be able to fulfill it? Now that I have the opportunity, will I not fulfill it?!</p>
<p class="bas indent1"><span class="nm">(i)</span>He was prolonging the word "Echad," and died while saying it. A voice from heaven announced, "Happy are you R. Akiva! You died while saying 'Echad'!"</p>
<p class="bas indent1"><span class="nm">(j)</span>(Tzelach - it is forbidden to interrupt during the verse "Shema Yisrael..."! R. Akiva's Talmidim knew that he wanted to die while saying Shema. They thought that he should not seek an early end to the torture, but rather should endure everything for the sake of Kidush Hash-m. Einayim l'Mishpat - perhaps it is permitted to interrupt to discuss Kabalas Ol Malchus Shamayim; Ramaz - he said all of Shema, and afterwards he answered the Talmidim, and then repeated "Shema Yisrael..." and died.)</p>
<p class="bas indent2"><span class="nm">1.</span><span class="cl">The angels (to Hash-m):</span> Is this the reward for Torah?! "Mi'Mesim Yadcha Hash-m mi'Mesim..." (his death should be through Your hands)!</p>
