<p class="bas subject"><span class="nm">1)</span>CONDITIONS OF INHERITING <i>ERETZ</i> <i>YISRAEL</i></p>
<p class="bas indent1"><span class="nm">(a)</span><span class="cl">(Beraisa):</span> Yehoshua made the inheritance of Eretz Yisrael conditional on the following 10 laws (we will explain on Amud B why there are only 10):</p>
<p class="bas indent2"><span class="nm">1.</span>People may graze animals in forests;</p>
<p class="bas indent2"><span class="nm">2.</span>People may collect wood from (others') fields;</p>
<p class="bas indent2"><span class="nm">3.</span>People may take grass from anywhere, except for a field of clover;</p>
<p class="bas indent2"><span class="nm">4.</span>In all places, people may cut branches to plant them to be new trees, except for stumps of olive trees;</p>
<p class="bas indent2"><span class="nm">5.</span>Local city dwellers have first rights to take water from a new spring;</p>
<p class="bas indent2"><span class="nm">6.</span>People may fish (with hooks on strings) in Lake Teveriyah, but they may not build traps, for these interfere with boats;</p>
<p class="bas indent2"><span class="nm">7.</span>People may relieve themselves in back of a fence, even in a field of saffron.</p>
<p class="bas indent2"><span class="nm">8.</span>After crops are gathered from a field until it is plowed (for next year's crop), people may walk through it, until the time of the second rainfall;</p>
<p class="bas indent2"><span class="nm">9.</span>People may walk on the side of the road (on the border of others' property), to avoid hardened clumps of dirt in the middle;</p>
<p class="bas indent2"><span class="nm">10.</span>One lost in a vineyard may cut vines until he finds his way to the road;</p>
<p class="bas indent2"><span class="nm">11.</span>A found corpse is buried where it is found.</p>
<p class="bas indent1"><span class="nm">(b)</span><span class="cl">(Rav Papa):</span> The Beraisa permits grazing animals in forests, i.e. small animals (i.e. sheep) in large forests (this will not consume too many of the trees). One may not graze large animals (i.e. cattle), nor (even small animals) in small forests.</p>
<p class="bas subject"><span class="nm">2)</span>THINGS THAT MAY BE TAKEN</p>
<p class="bas indent1"><span class="nm">(a)</span><span class="cl">(Beraisa):</span> People may take wood from (others') fields.</p>
<p class="bas indent1"><span class="nm">(b)</span>Only thorny shrubs may be taken, but not other wood. One may take only from what is growing, but not from what was already cut. One may only take from moist trees, not from dry trees;</p>
<p class="bas indent1"><span class="nm">(c)</span>One may not uproot the trees (rather, he must leave a stump).</p>
<p class="bas indent1"><span class="nm">(d)</span><span class="cl">(Beraisa):</span> People may take grass from anywhere, except from a field of clover.</p>
<p class="bas indent1"><span class="nm">(e)</span><span class="cl">Inference:</span> This connotes that grass helps clover.</p>
<p class="bas indent1"><span class="nm">(f)</span><span class="cl">Contradiction (Mishnah):</span> If grass sprouted amidst clover, we do not force him to uproot it to avoid the Isur of Kilayim (growing diverse species together, for surely he will eventually uproot the grasses, since they harm clover).</p>
<p class="bas indent1"><span class="nm">(g)</span><span class="cl">Answer #1 (R. Yirmiyah):</span> The Mishnah refers to one who intends to replant the clover. Grass is detrimental, it weakens it;</p>
<p class="bas indent2"><span class="nm">1.</span>The Beraisa discusses one who intends to eat the stalks. It grows better when it is draped over grass.</p>
<p class="bas indent1"><span class="nm">(h)</span><span class="cl">Answer #2:</span> Normally, grass is detrimental for clover. The Beraisa discusses clover planted for animals. Presumably, the owner wants the grass for his animals.</p>
<p class="bas indent1"><span class="nm">(i)</span><span class="cl">Question:</span> How do we know for which it was planted?</p>
<p class="bas indent1"><span class="nm">(j)</span><span class="cl">Answer (Rav Papa):</span> If it is in patches, it is for man. If not, it is for animals.</p>
<p class="bas indent1"><span class="nm">(k)</span><span class="cl">(Beraisa):</span> In all places, people may cut branches to plant them to be new trees, except for stumps of olive trees.</p>
<p class="bas indent1"><span class="nm">(l)</span><span class="cl">(R. Tanchum and R. Beryas):</span> For olive saplings, one must leave a stump the size of an egg. For reeds and vines, one may cut only above the highest bulge;</p>
<p class="bas indent2"><span class="nm">1.</span>Regarding all other trees, one may cut only the soft branches, not the thick ones. (Others explain - one may cut only (in the middle) where there are many branches, not the pinnacle.)</p>
<p class="bas indent2"><span class="nm">2.</span>One may cut only new trees that do not yet yield fruit, but not mature trees that bear fruit.</p>
<p class="bas indent2"><span class="nm">3.</span>One may cut only from the part that does not see the sun - "from the sweet fruits of the sun."</p>
<p class="bas bbbline">81b----------------------------------------81b</p>
<p class="bas indent1"><span class="nm">(m)</span><span class="cl">(Beraisa):</span> Local city dwellers have first right to take water from a new spring...</p>
<p class="bas indent2"><span class="nm">1.</span><span class="cl">(Rabah bar Rav Huna):</span> They must pay the one from whose property it emanates.</p>
<p class="bas indent2"><span class="nm">2.</span>The Halachah does not follow Rabah bar Rav Huna.</p>
<p class="bas indent1"><span class="nm">(n)</span><span class="cl">(Beraisa):</span> People may fish (with hooks on strings) in the lake of Teveriyah, but they may not build traps, for these interfere with boats.</p>
<p class="bas indent1"><span class="nm">(o)</span><span class="cl">(Beraisa):</span> At first, the tribes stipulated with each other that one may not spread large nets, which can interfere with river traffic, but one may hunt fish with small nets or traps.</p>
<p class="bas indent1"><span class="nm">(p)</span><span class="cl">(Beraisa):</span> The lake of Teveriyah was in Naftali's portion; Naftali also received an area to spread traps in the south, to fulfill "inherit the sea and the south".</p>
<p class="bas indent1"><span class="nm">(q)</span><span class="cl">(Beraisa - R. Shimon ben Elazar):</span> Uprooted trees (Meiri - everything detached) in the mountains belong to all the tribes. What is attached belongs to the tribe in which it is found.</p>
<p class="bas indent2"><span class="nm">1.</span>Every tribe received in the mountain, lowland, dry land and valley - "... come to the land of the Emori and its neighbors, in the plain, mountain, lowland, dry land and seashore."</p>
<p class="bas indent2"><span class="nm">2.</span>Also the land we took from the Kena'anim and Perizim was like this - "Emori and its neighbors" teaches that all were the same.</p>
<p class="bas subject"><span class="nm">3)</span>PERMISSION TO USE OTHERS' PROPERTY</p>
<p class="bas indent1"><span class="nm">(a)</span><span class="cl">(Beraisa):</span> People may relieve themselves in back of a fence, even in a field of saffron.</p>
<p class="bas indent1"><span class="nm">(b)</span><span class="cl">(Rav Acha bar Yakov):</span> The only Chidush is that one may take a stone from the fence.</p>
<p class="bas indent1"><span class="nm">(c)</span><span class="cl">(Rav Chisda):</span> This is permitted even on Shabbos.</p>
<p class="bas indent2"><span class="nm">1.</span>Mar Zutra the Chasid would replace the stone. He told his servant to plaster it well.</p>
<p class="bas indent1"><span class="nm">(d)</span><span class="cl">(Beraisa):</span> After crops are gathered from a field until it is plowed (for next year's crop), people may walk through it, until the time of the second rainfall.</p>
<p class="bas indent1"><span class="nm">(e)</span><span class="cl">(Rav Papa):</span> In Bavel, walking on a field harms it (and is forbidden) even if dew fell the previous night.</p>
<p class="bas indent1"><span class="nm">(f)</span><span class="cl">(Beraisa):</span> People may walk on the side of the road (on the border of others' property), to avoid hardened clumps of dirt in the middle.</p>
<p class="bas indent1"><span class="nm">(g)</span>Shmuel and Rav Yehudah were walking on a road (in Bavel). Shmuel went to the side.</p>
<p class="bas indent2"><span class="nm">1.</span><span class="cl">Rav Yehudah:</span> Do Yehoshua's enactments also apply in Bavel?!</p>
<p class="bas indent2"><span class="nm">2.</span><span class="cl">Shmuel:</span> Yes, they were also for Chutz la'Aretz.</p>
<p class="bas indent1"><span class="nm">(h)</span>Rav and R. Chiya were walking on the road; they went to the side. Rav Yehudah bar Kenosa was ahead of them, walking in the middle, taking big steps to avoid the obstacles.</p>
<p class="bas indent2"><span class="nm">1.</span><span class="cl">Rav:</span> Who is that? That is haughtiness, not to rely on Yehoshua's Tanayim!</p>
<p class="bas indent2"><span class="nm">2.</span><span class="cl">R. Chiya:</span> Perhaps it is my Talmid Rav Yehudah bar Kenosa. All his actions are for the sake of Heaven.</p>
<p class="bas indent3"><span class="nm">i.</span>R. Chiya found that this was so. He told Rav Yehudah 'anyone else who did so would be excommunicated for haughtiness.'</p>
<p class="bas indent1"><span class="nm">(i)</span><span class="cl">(Beraisa):</span> One lost in a vineyard may cut vines until he finds his way to the road.</p>
<p class="bas indent1"><span class="nm">(j)</span><span class="cl">(Beraisa):</span> If Reuven saw Shimon lost in a vineyard, Reuven may cut vines until he helps Shimon find his way.</p>
<p class="bas indent1"><span class="nm">(k)</span>Similarly, if Reuven is lost he may cut vines until he finds his way.</p>
<p class="bas indent1"><span class="nm">(l)</span><span class="cl">Question:</span> What is the Chidush of the second clause?</p>
<p class="bas indent1"><span class="nm">(m)</span><span class="cl">Answer:</span> One might have thought that one may cut vines only if he knows the way. Otherwise, one must backtrack without cutting vines.</p>
<p class="bas indent1"><span class="nm">(n)</span><span class="cl">Question:</span> Why is this listed among enactments of Yehoshua? It is mid'Oraisa!</p>
<p class="bas indent2"><span class="nm">1.</span><span class="cl">(Beraisa):</span> "You will return him" teaches that it is a Mitzvah to return another's body (help him find his way if he is lost).</p>
<p class="bas indent1"><span class="nm">(o)</span><span class="cl">Answer:</span> Mid'Oraisa, one may not harm another's property to help him. Yehoshua enacted that he may cut vines for this.</p>
<p class="bas indent1"><span class="nm">(p)</span><span class="cl">(Beraisa):</span> A corpse that is found is buried in that place.</p>
<p class="bas indent1"><span class="nm">(q)</span><span class="cl">Contradiction (Beraisa):</span> A corpse found on a public road is buried to the right or left side of the road, whichever place will cause less loss.</p>
<p class="bas indent2"><span class="nm">1.</span>There is less loss in an unplowed field than in a plowed field. There is less loss in a plowed field than in a seeded field.</p>
<p class="bas indent2"><span class="nm">2.</span>If both sides are similar, the corpse may be buried in either side.</p>
<p class="bas indent1"><span class="nm">(r)</span><span class="cl">Answer (Rav Bivi):</span> The case is, the corpse lies on the width of the road. We do not bury it there, for then people who pass would become Tamei;</p>
<p class="bas indent2"><span class="nm">1.</span>Since we cannot bury it in his place, we may move it anywhere.</p>
<p class="bas subject"><span class="nm">4)</span>OTHER ENACTMENTS</p>
<p class="bas indent1"><span class="nm">(a)</span><span class="cl">Question:</span> The Beraisa said there were 10 enactments, but it listed 11!</p>
<p class="bas indent1"><span class="nm">(b)</span><span class="cl">Answer:</span> Shlomo enacted that people may walk through a field after the crops have been gathered (until it is plowed).</p>
<p class="bas indent2"><span class="nm">1.</span><span class="cl">(Beraisa):</span> If Reuven gathered his crops, and does not allow people to walk through his field, there is no justification for this. They would not harm his field!</p>
<p class="bas indent3"><span class="nm">i.</span>It says about this 'in place of being good, do not be called evil'.</p>
<p class="bas indent3"><span class="nm">ii.</span><span class="cl">Question:</span> There is no such verse!</p>
<p class="bas indent3"><span class="nm">iii.</span><span class="cl">Answer:</span> This is the meaning of "do not withhold doing good for someone; if you have the ability, do it."</p>
<p class="bas indent1"><span class="nm">(c)</span><span class="cl">Question:</span> Yehoshua made other enactments!</p>
<p class="bas indent2"><span class="nm">1.</span><span class="cl">(Beraisa - R. Yehudah):</span> When people normally put dung out, one may put dung in the Reshus ha'Rabim for 30 days so people and animals will trample on it. Yehoshua made this a condition for inheriting Eretz Yisrael.</p>
<p class="bas indent2"><span class="nm">2.</span><span class="cl">(Beraisa - R. Yishmael son of Rebbi Yochanan ben Berokah):</span> Yehoshua made the inheritance of Eretz Yisrael conditional on these three enactments:</p>
<p class="bas indent3"><span class="nm">i.</span>If Reuven's bees settled on a branch in Shimon's field, Reuven may cut off the branch to retrieve his bees and pay for the branch;</p>
<p class="bas indent3"><span class="nm">ii.</span>If Reuven was carrying a barrel of honey and it broke, and Shimon was carrying a barrel of wine (which is cheaper than honey), Shimon should spill out his wine to save the honey. Reuven to pays him the value of his wine.</p>
<p class="bas indent3"><span class="nm">iii.</span>If Reuven's donkey, which was carrying flax, died, and Shimon's donkey was carrying wood, (which is cheaper than flax,) Shimon should dump his wood and load the flax on his donkey. Reuven pays to him the value of his wood.</p>
<p class="bas indent1"><span class="nm">(d)</span><span class="cl">Answer:</span> Our Tana lists only Tanayim that all agree about. Only one Tana holds that Yehoshua made these other enactments.</p>
