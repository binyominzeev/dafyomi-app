<p class="bas indent1"><span class="nm">(a)</span>Bar Hedya used to interpret dreams; he would interpret favorably for one who paid him, and unfavorably for one who did not.</p>
<p class="bas indent1"><span class="nm">(b)</span>Abaye and Rava dreamed the same dream, and asked Bar Hedya to interpret it; Abaye gave him a Zuz, Rava did not.</p>
<p class="bas indent1"><span class="nm">(c)</span><span class="cl">Abaye and Rava:</span> The verse "Shorcha Tavu'ach Lefanecha..." (your ox will be slaughtered, you will not eat from it) was read to us [in the dream]. (This and the next two verses are from the curses in Devarim.)</p>
<p class="bas indent1"><span class="nm">(d)</span>Bar Hedya told Rava that his business will fail, and he will be so sad that he will not taste his food; he told Abaye that his business will prosper, and he will be so sated with joy that he will not feel a need to eat.</p>
<p class="bas indent1"><span class="nm">(e)</span>(Ben Yehoyada - Hash-m gave certain people the wisdom to interpret dreams correctly; He caused that whoever was meant to have a bad interpretation would not pay Bar Hedya.)</p>

<p class="bas indent1"><span class="nm">(l)</span><span class="cl">Abaye and Rava:</span> The verse "Zera Rav Totzi ha'Sadeh" was read to us.</p>
<p class="bas indent1"><span class="nm">(m)</span>Bar Hedya said that these words will apply to Abaye (his land will produce much), to Rava he applied the end of the verse (you will harvest little, for locusts will eat it).</p>

<p class="bas indent1"><span class="nm">(a)</span><span class="cl">Abaye and Rava:</span> We saw meat on barrels.</p>
<p class="bas indent1"><span class="nm">(b)</span>Bar Hedya said that Abaye's wine will smell nice, everyone will come to buy meat and wine from him; Rava's wine will turn to vinegar, people will buy meat to eat with it.</p>
<p class="bas indent1"><span class="nm">(c)</span><span class="cl">Abaye and Rava:</span> We saw a barrel hanging from a date tree.</p>
<p class="bas indent1"><span class="nm">(d)</span>Bar Hedya said that Abaye's business will grow like a date tree, Rava's business will be sweet (i.e. cheap) like dates.</p>

<p class="bas indent1"><span class="nm">(f)</span>Bar Hedya said that Abaye's wares will be expensive like pomegranates, Rava's will be detested like [sour] pomegranates</p>
<p class="bas indent1"><span class="nm">(g)</span><span class="cl">Abaye and Rava:</span> We saw a barrel fall into a well.</p>
<p class="bas indent1"><span class="nm">(h)</span>Bar Hedya said that Abaye's merchandise will be highly sought [but usually sold out], as people say, "The bread fell in the well and can't be found";</p>
<p class="bas indent2"><span class="nm">1.</span>Rava's merchandise will be despised and thrown into a well.</p>
<p class="bas indent1"><span class="nm">(i)</span><span class="cl">Abaye and Rava:</span> We saw a young donkey standing near our heads and braying.</p>
<p class="bas indent1"><span class="nm">(j)</span>Bar Hedya said that Abaye would be Rosh Yeshivah, a translator will be next to him;</p>
<p class="bas indent2"><span class="nm">1.</span>He told Rava that the words "Peter Chamor" are missing from his Tefilin.</p>
<p class="bas indent2"><span class="nm">2.</span><span class="cl">Version #1 (our text) Rava:</span> I saw them, they are there!</p>

<p class="bas indent2"><span class="nm">4.</span>(Ben Yehoyada - Rava's Tefilin were not Pasul; the correction of the letter "Vav" was done before anything further was written. Rather, without a Vav, the word reads like Chemar (wine) - Hash-m informed Rava about the Vav to hint that he should not engage solely in Torah (which is called wine), rather, also in Chesed (a pillar of the world, symbolized by the letter Vav).</p>
<p class="bas indent2"><span class="nm">5.</span><span class="cl">Version #2 (Bach):</span> Rava checked and found that a "Vav" was erased.</p>
<p class="bas indent1"><span class="nm">(k)</span>Rava asked about the following by himself:</p>

<p class="bas indent3"><span class="nm">i.</span>Rava sat in the study hall that entire day. He saw two blind men fighting with each other, and went to separate them; they hit him twice, and raised their sticks to hit him again.</p>
<p class="bas indent3"><span class="nm">ii.</span><span class="cl">Rava:</span> You hit me enough -- I saw only two [turnip heads]!</p>
<p class="bas indent1"><span class="nm">(l)</span>In the end, Rava paid Bar Hedya to interpret.</p>
<p class="bas indent2"><span class="nm">1.</span><span class="cl">Rava:</span> I saw a wall (alternatively -- the foundation of the house) fall.</p>
<p class="bas indent2"><span class="nm">2.</span><span class="cl">Bar Hedya:</span> You will buy property without limit.</p>
<p class="bas indent2"><span class="nm">3.</span><span class="cl">Rava:</span> I saw Abaye's house fall, and I was covered with its dirt.</p>

<p class="bas indent2"><span class="nm">9.</span><span class="cl">Rava:</span> Hallel Mitzrayim (the standard Hallel, the psalm of praises said when leaving Mitzrayim) was read to me.</p>
<p class="bas indent2"><span class="nm">10.</span><span class="cl">Bar Hedya:</span> A miracle will be done for you.</p>
<p class="bas indent1"><span class="nm">(m)</span>Bar Hedya was traveling on the same boat as Rava -- he decided to get off, lest the boat sink and only Rava would be saved. As he was getting off, he dropped a book; Rava saw that it said that dreams are [fulfilled] according to the mouth (their interpretation).</p>
<p class="bas indent1"><span class="nm">(n)</span><span class="cl">Rava:</span> You are a Rasha! I suffered from all your evil interpretations! I forgive you for all of them, except for the death of [my wife,] Rav Chisda's daughter! May it be His will that you be handed over to a kingdom that will have no mercy on you! (Anaf Yosef - Rava already knew that dreams are according to the mouth, but he did not know that Bar Hedya knew this, so he did not curse him earlier. Ben Yehoyada - Rava forgave him for his own suffering, for it was decreed from above, and so Rava would not be responsible for Bar Hedya's punishment; he could not pardon him on behalf of his wife. Also, Bar Hedya should not have said explicitly that she will die, for then it is much more difficult to reverse the decree.)</p>
<p class="bas indent1"><span class="nm">(o)</span><span class="cl">Bar Hedya:</span> What can I do? A Chacham's curse is fulfilled, even if it is unjustified -- all the more so Rava's, for he justifiably cursed me! I will exile myself; it was taught that exile atones for sin (Ben Yehoyada - in particular, causing death (to Rava's wife) b'Shogeg, accidentally).</p>
<p class="bas indent1"><span class="nm">(p)</span>He exiled himself to Rome, and sat at the door of the guardian of the treasury. The guardian said that he had a dream that a needle entered his finger; Bar Hedya did not agree to interpret it unless he would pay a Zuz; the guardian refused.</p>
<p class="bas indent1"><span class="nm">(q)</span>Later, the guard told him that he dreamed that a worm fell between his fingers; Bar Hedya refused to interpret it for free. In yet another dream, a worm fell on his whole hand; Bar Hedya said that worms came upon all the silk (in the treasury). The king killed the guardian; before dying, he said that they should rather kill the one who knew about it but did not say anything.</p>
<p class="bas indent2"><span class="nm">1.</span><span class="cl">They told Bar Hedya:</span> Because of the one Zuz you wanted, all the king's silk robes were destroyed! They [bent and] tied two cedar trees together, and tied one of his legs to each tree. They untied the trees, they snapped back, Bar Hedya was split in two, up to and including his head.</p>
