<p class="bas subject"><span class="nm">1)</span>THE DIFFERENCES BETWEEN MONETARY AND CAPITAL CASES</p>
<p class="bas indent1"><span class="nm">(a)</span><span class="cl">(Mishnah):</span> The same laws of Drishah v'Chakirah apply to monetary and capital cases - "Mishpat Echad Yihyeh Lachem."</p>
<p class="bas indent1"><span class="nm">(b)</span>The following are different in monetary and capital cases:</p>
<p class="bas indent2"><span class="nm">1.</span>Monetary cases require three judges. Capital cases require 23;</p>
<p class="bas indent2"><span class="nm">2.</span>In monetary cases, the judges may begin their discussion with an opinion for Zechus or Chiyuv. Capital cases must begin with Zechus;</p>
<p class="bas indent2"><span class="nm">3.</span>In monetary cases, a majority of one suffices for Zechus or Chiyuv. In capital cases, a majority of one suffices for Zechus, but a majority of two is needed for Chiyuv;</p>
<p class="bas indent2"><span class="nm">4.</span>In monetary cases, we can overturn a verdict of Zechus or Chiyuv. In capital cases, we can overturn a verdict of Chiyuv, but not of Zechus.</p>
<p class="bas indent2"><span class="nm">5.</span>In monetary cases, anyone (even Talmidim) can give a reason for Zechus or Chiyuv. In capital cases, anyone can give a reason for Zechus, but not everyone can give a reason for Chiyuv.</p>
<p class="bas indent2"><span class="nm">6.</span>In monetary cases, one who gave a reason for Zechus can give a reason for Chiyuv, or vice-versa. In capital cases, one who gave a reason for Chiyuv can give a reason for Zechus, but one who gave a reason for Zechus cannot give a reason for Chiyuv.</p>
<p class="bas indent2"><span class="nm">7.</span>Monetary cases must be started during the day, and they can be finished at night. Capital cases are started and finished during the day.</p>
<p class="bas indent2"><span class="nm">8.</span>Monetary cases are judged and finished on the same day, for Zechus or Chiyuv. Capital cases can be finished on the same day for Zechus, but a verdict of Chiyuv cannot be given until the next day;</p>
<p class="bas indent3"><span class="nm">i.</span>Therefore, we do not begin capital cases on Erev Shabbos or Erev Yom Tov.</p>
<p class="bas indent2"><span class="nm">9.</span>In monetary cases or questions of Tum'ah, the greatest Chacham begins (gives his opinion). In capital cases, we may not begin with the greatest Chacham.</p>
<p class="bas indent2"><span class="nm">10.</span>Everyone (even a Mamzer) may judge monetary cases, but capital cases require Kohanim, Leviyim or Yisraelim who may marry a Bas Kohen.</p>
<p class="bas indent1"><span class="nm">(c)</span><span class="cl">(Gemara) Question:</span> Do monetary cases really require Drishah v'Chakirah?</p>
<p class="bas indent2"><span class="nm">1.</span><span class="cl">Contradiction (Beraisa):</span> If Yo'av and Michah were signed on a document dated 'Nisan 1, in Shemitah (in the place Ploni)', and Reuven and David said 'they were with us that day elsewhere (too far to get to Ploni the same day)', the document and its witnesses are Kesherim. We assume that it was postdated.</p>
<p class="bas indent2"><span class="nm">2.</span>This shows that we do not require Drishah v'Chakirah (it is primarily to enable Hazamah)!</p>
<p class="bas indent2"><span class="nm">3.</span><span class="cl">Question:</span> Why didn't we ask from a Mishnah?</p>
<p class="bas indent3"><span class="nm">i.</span><span class="cl">(Mishnah):</span> Predated loan documents are disqualified (because they can be used to swindle), postdated loan documents are Kesherim.</p>
<p class="bas indent3"><span class="nm">ii.</span>If we require Drishah v'Chakirah, why are they Kesherim?</p>
<p class="bas indent2"><span class="nm">4.</span><span class="cl">Answer:</span> The Beraisa is a bigger Chidush. Even though it is unlikely that one would postdate a document and give a date in Shemitah, since it looks suspicious (people usually refrain from lending in Shemitah, lest the loan be cancelled), we assume that this was the case;</p>
<p class="bas indent3"><span class="nm">i.</span>Shemitah does not cancel loans until the end of Shemitah, therefore the document is valid.</p>
<p class="bas indent1"><span class="nm">(d)</span>The contradiction has not been resolved yet.</p>
<p class="bas indent1"><span class="nm">(e)</span><span class="cl">Answer #1 (R. Chanina):</span> Our Mishnah teaches that <i>mid'Oraisa</i>, the same laws of Drishah v'Chakirah apply to monetary and capital cases - "Mishpat Echad Yihyeh Lachem";</p>
<p class="bas indent2"><span class="nm">1.</span>Chachamim enacted that monetary cases do not require Drishah v'Chakirah, due to Ne'ilas Delet (lest one be deterred from lending, out of fear that the witnesses will remember the loan but forget Drishos or Chakiros, and he will be unable to collect).</p>
<p class="bas bbbline">32b----------------------------------------32b</p>
<p class="bas indent1"><span class="nm">(f)</span><span class="cl">Question:</span> If so, we should say that Beis Din does not pay if they err (since they could not interrogate the witnesses)!</p>
<p class="bas indent1"><span class="nm">(g)</span><span class="cl">Answer:</span> All the more so, that would discourage people from lending!</p>
<p class="bas indent1"><span class="nm">(h)</span><span class="cl">Answer #2 (Rava):</span> Our Mishnah discusses fines (Ne'ilas Delet does not apply, so no enactment was made). The Beraisa discusses admissions and loans (in which Drishah v'Chakirah was abolished).</p>
<p class="bas indent1"><span class="nm">(i)</span><span class="cl">Answer #3 (Rav Papa):</span> Both discuss admissions and loans. Our Mishnah discusses a Din Merumeh (when Beis Din senses that the claim is false). The Beraisa discusses a normal case.</p>
<p class="bas indent2"><span class="nm">1.</span><span class="cl">Contradiction (Reish Lakish):</span> It says "b'Tzedek Tishpot Amisecha", and it says "Tzedek Tzedek Tirdof" (one must be extra zealous to reach the correct verdict)!</p>
<p class="bas indent2"><span class="nm">2.</span><span class="cl">Answer #1 (Reish Lakish):</span> One must be extra zealous in a Din Merumeh.</p>
<p class="bas indent2"><span class="nm">3.</span><span class="cl">Answer #2 (Rav Ashi):</span> (We resolve the Mishnah and Beraisa like R. Chanina or Rava.) "Tzedek Tzedek Tirdof" teaches to equally pursue Din (letter of the law) or compromise.</p>
<p class="bas indent3"><span class="nm">i.</span><span class="cl">(Beraisa):</span> "Tzedek Tzedek Tirdof" - equally pursue Din and compromise. If two ships encounter each other in a narrow river, if they try to pass at the same time, both will sink. If they go one after the other, both will pass.</p>
<p class="bas indent3"><span class="nm">ii.</span>The same applies to two camels ascending (in opposite directions) the incline to Beis Choron, and they meet at the peak (it is wide enough for only one). If they go at the same time, they will fall. If one waits for the other, both will pass;</p>
<p class="bas indent3"><span class="nm">iii.</span>If one was laden and the other empty, the laden one goes first. If one was near its city and the other far, the far one goes first;</p>
<p class="bas indent3"><span class="nm">iv.</span>If they are equal, make a compromise between them. The one that waits receives compensation.</p>
<p class="bas indent1"><span class="nm">(j)</span><span class="cl">(Beraisa):</span> "Tzedek Tzedek Tirdof" - go to a good Beis Din, e.g. to R. Eliezer in Lud, or to R. Yochanan Ben Zakai in Beror Chayil.</p>
<p class="bas indent1"><span class="nm">(k)</span><span class="cl">(Beraisa):</span> If a mill is heard in Boreni, this hints to (grinding spices to cure the wound of) a circumcision (when the king decreed against circumcision, they could not openly announce it);</p>
<p class="bas indent2"><span class="nm">1.</span>A lamp burning (by day, or many lamps at night) in Beror Chayil is a sign of a circumcision feast.</p>
<p class="bas indent1"><span class="nm">(l)</span><span class="cl">(Beraisa):</span> "Tzedek Tzedek Tirdof" - go to the Beis ha'Va'ad: to R. Eliezer in Lud, to R. Yochanan Ben Zakai in Beror Chayil... or to the Great Sanhedrin in Lishkas ha'Gazis.</p>
<p class="bas subject"><span class="nm">2)</span>WE BEGIN MONETARY CASES WITH ZECHUS</p>
<p class="bas indent1"><span class="nm">(a)</span><span class="cl">(Mishnah):</span> In monetary cases, we begin...</p>
<p class="bas indent1"><span class="nm">(b)</span><span class="cl">Question:</span> How do we begin (to interrogate the witnesses, for Zechus, in capital cases)?</p>
<p class="bas indent1"><span class="nm">(c)</span><span class="cl">Answer #1 (Rav Yehudah):</span> We say 'who says that it was like you say?!'</p>
<p class="bas indent1"><span class="nm">(d)</span><span class="cl">Objection (Ula):</span> This will make them retract!</p>
<p class="bas indent2"><span class="nm">1.</span><span class="cl">Question:</span> What is wrong with that?</p>
<p class="bas indent3"><span class="nm">i.</span><span class="cl">(Beraisa - R. Shimon ben Elazar):</span> We make the witnesses move from place to place, perhaps this will confound them and they will decide not to testify.</p>
<p class="bas indent2"><span class="nm">2.</span><span class="cl">Answer:</span> We encourage them to retract on their own (if they are lying). We do not induce them to retract (perhaps they are telling the truth)!.</p>
<p class="bas indent1"><span class="nm">(e)</span><span class="cl">Answer #2 (Ula):</span> We ask the defendant if he has witnesses to Mezim them.</p>
<p class="bas indent1"><span class="nm">(f)</span><span class="cl">Objection (Rabah):</span> Do we begin with Zechus for the defendant that is (mortal) liability for the witnesses?!</p>
<p class="bas indent2"><span class="nm">1.</span><span class="cl">Question:</span> (If Mezimim come now,) this is not liability for the witnesses!</p>
<p class="bas indent3"><span class="nm">i.</span><span class="cl">(Mishnah):</span> Edim Zomemim are killed only if there was a final verdict to kill the defendant.</p>
<p class="bas indent2"><span class="nm">2.</span><span class="cl">Correction:</span> Rabah meant that do we begin with Zechus for the defendant, which (if there would be a final verdict before Mezimim were brought) could obligate witnesses to die?!</p>
<p class="bas indent1"><span class="nm">(g)</span><span class="cl">Answer #3 (Rabah):</span> We ask the defendant if he has witnesses to contradict them.</p>
<p class="bas indent1"><span class="nm">(h)</span><span class="cl">Answer #4 (Rav Kahana):</span> We say 'from your words, Ploni is innocent.'</p>
<p class="bas indent1"><span class="nm">(i)</span><span class="cl">Answer #5 (Abaye and Rava):</span> We tell Ploni 'if you did not kill, don't worry. (You will not be killed.)'</p>
<p class="bas indent1"><span class="nm">(j)</span><span class="cl">Answer #6 (Rav Ashi):</span> We say ''whoever knows Zechus for Ploni, let him come and say it!'</p>
<p class="bas indent2"><span class="nm">1.</span><span class="cl">Support (for Abaye and Rava - Beraisa - Rebbi):</span> "Im Lo Shachav..." teaches that in capital cases we begin with Zechus.</p>
