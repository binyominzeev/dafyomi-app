<p class="bas subject"><span class="nm">1)</span>IBUR DUE TO THE TEKUFAH</p>
<p class="bas indent1"><span class="nm">(a)</span><span class="cl">(Shmuel):</span> We are Me'aber the year (due to the Tekufah) only if the Tekufah (of Tamuz, the 91 and a quarter days after the solstice) would extend into the majority of Tishrei (if we would not be Me'aber) .</p>
<p class="bas indent2"><span class="nm">1.</span><span class="cl">Question:</span> What is considered the majority of a month?</p>
<p class="bas indent2"><span class="nm">2.</span><span class="cl">Answer (Shmuel):</span> R. Yehudah requires 16 days, and R. Yosi requires 21 days.</p>
<p class="bas indent1"><span class="nm">(b)</span>Both of them expound "Chag ha'Asif Tekufas ha'Shanah." R. Yehudah holds that all of Chol ha'Mo'ed Sukos must be in the new Tekufah. R. Yosi holds that part of Chol ha'Mo'ed (i.e. at least the last day, the 21st) must be in the new Tekufah.</p>
<p class="bas indent1"><span class="nm">(c)</span><span class="cl">Question:</span> How do they hold (about the day of (transition of) the Tekufah)?</p>
<p class="bas indent2"><span class="nm">1.</span>If they hold that the day of the Tekufah ends (and is considered part of) the (previous) Tekufah), even if 15 days (for R. Yehudah, or 20 for R. Yosi) of the old Tekufah would fall in Tishrei (without Ibur), we must be Me'aber the year (for if the Tekufah falls on the 16th (or 21st), the first day of the new Tekufah is the 17th (or 22nd))!</p>
<p class="bas indent1"><span class="nm">(d)</span><span class="cl">Answer:</span> They hold that the day of the Tekufah begins the new Tekufah.</p>
<p class="bas indent1"><span class="nm">(e)</span><span class="cl">Question #1 (Beraisa - R. Yehudah):</span> The day of the Tekufah ends;</p>
<p class="bas indent1"><span class="nm">(f)</span>R. Yosi says, the day of the Tekufah begins.</p>
<p class="bas indent1"><span class="nm">(g)</span><span class="cl">Question #2 (Beraisa):</span> We are Me'aber the year only if (otherwise,) the Tekufah would extend into the majority of the month (of Tishrei);</p>
<p class="bas indent2"><span class="nm">1.</span>The majority of the month is 16 days;</p>
<p class="bas indent2"><span class="nm">2.</span>R. Yehudah says, we require two thirds of the month, i.e. 20 days;</p>
<p class="bas indent2"><span class="nm">3.</span>R. Yosi says, if 16 days of the Tekufah (of winter) would remain when (Nisan, the month of) Pesach comes, we are Me'aber the year. If 16 days of the (summer) Tekufah will remain when (Tishrei, the month of) Sukos comes, we are not Me'aber the year;</p>
<p class="bas indent2"><span class="nm">4.</span>R. Shimon says, also if 16 days of the Tekufah remain before Tishrei, we are Me'aber;</p>
<p class="bas indent2"><span class="nm">5.</span>Others say, even if a minority remains (we are Me'aber);</p>
<p class="bas indent3"><span class="nm">i.</span>A minority containing 14 days is required.</p>
<p class="bas indent2"><span class="nm">6.</span><span class="cl">Summation of question:</span> This contradicts what Shmuel said above (a:2) according to R. Yehudah!</p>
<p class="bas indent1"><span class="nm">(h)</span>This is left difficult.</p>
<p class="bas indent1"><span class="nm">(i)</span><span class="cl">(Beraisa - R. Yehudah):</span> We require two thirds of the month, i.e. 20 days;</p>
<p class="bas indent1"><span class="nm">(j)</span>R. Yosi says, if 16 days of the Tekufah remain before Nisan, we are Me'aber.</p>
<p class="bas indent1"><span class="nm">(k)</span><span class="cl">Question:</span> (There are 182 (and a half, which we ignore) days altogether in the spring and summer Tekufos, and 177 days in the six months from Nisan until Tishrei. If 16 days of the winter Tekufah will remain before Nisan, 21 days (of Tekufas Tamuz) will remain before Tishrei.) R. Yosi holds like R. Yehudah (only part of Chol ha'Mo'ed Sukos must be in the new Tekufah)!</p>
<p class="bas indent1"><span class="nm">(l)</span><span class="cl">Answer:</span> They argue about the day of the Tekufah. R. Yehudah says that it ends (therefore, we are Me'aber if otherwise the Tekufah would fall on the 21st). R. Yosi says that it begins (therefore, we are Me'aber if it would fall on the 20th).</p>
<p class="bas indent1"><span class="nm">(m)</span><span class="cl">Question (Beraisa - R. Yosi):</span> If 16 days of the Tekufah would remain before Tishrei, we are not Me'aber;</p>
<p class="bas indent2"><span class="nm">1.</span><span class="cl">Inference:</span> If 17 (or more) days would remain, we are Me'aber.</p>
<p class="bas indent2"><span class="nm">2.</span><span class="cl">Contradiction (Beraisa - R. Yosi):</span> If 16 days would remain before Nisan, we are Me'aber.</p>
<p class="bas indent3"><span class="nm">i.</span><span class="cl">Inference:</span> If 15 (or less) would remain, we are not Me'aber (even though 20 days would remain before Tishrei, as we calculated above)!</p>
<p class="bas indent1"><span class="nm">(n)</span><span class="cl">Answer:</span> Really, even if 17 (or more, up to 20) days would remain before Tishrei, we are <i>not</i> Me'aber;</p>
<p class="bas indent2"><span class="nm">1.</span>R. Yosi mentioned 16 for parallel structure (to the previous law, if 16 days would remain before Nisan, we are Me'aber).</p>
<p class="bas indent1"><span class="nm">(o)</span><span class="cl">(Beraisa - R. Shimon):</span> Also if 16 days of the Tekufah would remain before Tishrei, we are Me'aber.</p>
<p class="bas indent1"><span class="nm">(p)</span><span class="cl">Question:</span> This is like the first Tana!</p>
<p class="bas bbbline">13b----------------------------------------13b</p>
<p class="bas indent1"><span class="nm">(q)</span><span class="cl">Answer:</span> They argue about the day of the Tekufah (but we do not know who says that it ends and who says that it begins).</p>
<p class="bas subject"><span class="nm">2)</span>THE OPINION OF OTHERS</p>
<p class="bas indent1"><span class="nm">(a)</span><span class="cl">(Beraisa - Others):</span> Even if a minority of 14 days would remain (we are Me'aber).</p>
<p class="bas indent1"><span class="nm">(b)</span><span class="cl">Question:</span> Even if they hold that the day of the Tekufah ends, the new Tekufah would begin on the 16th, and all of Chol ha'Mo'ed would be in the new Tekufah. Why are we Me'aber?!</p>
<p class="bas indent1"><span class="nm">(c)</span><span class="cl">Answer #1 (Rav Shmuel bar Rav Yitzchak):</span> Others discuss the remaining days before Nisan;</p>
<p class="bas indent2"><span class="nm">1.</span>"Shamor Es Chodesh ha'Aviv" - ensure that the Tekufah of Aviv (i.e. of Nisan) will begin in the first half of the month, before the moon is full.</p>
<p class="bas indent2"><span class="nm">2.</span><span class="cl">Question:</span> If 14 days remain, it would suffice to add a day to Adar! (Why must we be Me'aber the year?)</p>
<p class="bas indent2"><span class="nm">3.</span><span class="cl">Answer (Rav Acha bar Yakov):</span> Indeed, that is true. The Tana counts from the top down. We are Me'aber as long as the remaining days would be (at least 15,) but not a minority of Nisan;</p>
<p class="bas indent1"><span class="nm">(d)</span><span class="cl">Answer #2 (Ravina):</span> Really, Others discuss the remaining days before Tishrei. They require that all of Sukos, even the first day of Yom Tov, be in the new Tekufah.</p>
<p class="bas indent1"><span class="nm">(e)</span><span class="cl">Question:</span> We learn from "Chag ha'Asif" - Asifah (gathering) is forbidden on Yom Tov!</p>
<p class="bas indent1"><span class="nm">(f)</span><span class="cl">Answer:</span> It means, the festival that comes at the time of gathering.</p>
<p class="bas subject"><span class="nm">3)</span>SEMICHAH</p>
<p class="bas indent1"><span class="nm">(a)</span><span class="cl">(Mishnah - R. Shimon):</span> Three judges are needed for Semichah of judges.</p>
<p class="bas indent1"><span class="nm">(b)</span><span class="cl">(Beraisa) Suggestion:</span> Perhaps "v'Somchu Ziknei..." (the Chachamim who lean on a Par He'elem Davar (a Korban brought for a mistake of the Sanhedrin)) need not be from the Sanhedrin!</p>
<p class="bas indent1"><span class="nm">(c)</span><span class="cl">Rejection:</span> It says "Edah".</p>
<p class="bas indent2"><span class="nm">1.</span><span class="cl">Suggestion:</span> Perhaps they can be from a small Sanhedrin!</p>
<p class="bas indent2"><span class="nm">2.</span><span class="cl">Rejection:</span> "Ha'Edah" refers to the most special one (the Great Sanhedrin).</p>
<p class="bas indent1"><span class="nm">(d)</span>R. Yehudah says, "v'Somchu" teaches two judges, and "Ziknei" teaches two. We do not make a Beis Din with an even number, so we add a fifth.</p>
<p class="bas indent1"><span class="nm">(e)</span>R. Shimon says, "Ziknei" teaches two judges. We do not make a Beis Din with an even number, so we add a third.</p>
<p class="bas indent2"><span class="nm">1.</span><span class="cl">Question:</span> Why doesn't R. Shimon learn from "v'Somchu"?</p>
<p class="bas indent2"><span class="nm">2.</span><span class="cl">Answer:</span> This is needed to teach that they do Semichah!</p>
<p class="bas indent2"><span class="nm">3.</span>R. Yehudah expounds it, for it could have omitted this, and said only 'Ziknei ha'Edah Yedeihem Al Rosh ha'Par.'</p>
<p class="bas indent2"><span class="nm">4.</span>R. Shimon says, had it said so, one might have thought that 'Al' means <i>near</i>.</p>
<p class="bas indent2"><span class="nm">5.</span>R. Yehudah says, we would learn from the Gezerah Shavah "Rosh-Rosh" from an Olah.</p>
<p class="bas indent2"><span class="nm">6.</span>R. Shimon had no tradition for this Gezerah Shavah.</p>
<p class="bas indent1"><span class="nm">(f)</span><span class="cl">(Beraisa - R. Shimon):</span> Three judges are needed for Semichah and Semichah of Zekenim.</p>
<p class="bas indent1"><span class="nm">(g)</span><span class="cl">Question:</span> What is the difference between Semichah and Semichah of Zekenim?</p>
<p class="bas indent1"><span class="nm">(h)</span><span class="cl">Answer (R. Yochanan):</span> (Semichah is leaning on a Korban for a mistake of the Sanhedrin.) Semichah of Zekenim is ordination of judges.</p>
<p class="bas indent1"><span class="nm">(i)</span><span class="cl">Question (Abaye):</span> Question: What is the source that Semichah of Zekenim requires three judges?</p>
<p class="bas indent2"><span class="nm">1.</span>If we learn from Moshe's Semichah of Yehoshua, one should suffice - "va'Yismoch Es Yadav Alav"!</p>
<p class="bas indent2"><span class="nm">2.</span><span class="cl">Suggestion:</span> Perhaps Moshe is considered like 71 judges.</p>
<p class="bas indent2"><span class="nm">3.</span><span class="cl">Rejection:</span> If so, we should need 71!</p>
<p class="bas indent1"><span class="nm">(j)</span>This is left difficult.</p>
<p class="bas indent1"><span class="nm">(k)</span><span class="cl">Question (Rav Acha brei d'Rava):</span> Must Semichah be with the hand?</p>
<p class="bas indent1"><span class="nm">(l)</span><span class="cl">Answer (Rav Ashi):</span> (No.) Semichah is giving the title 'Rebbi' and permission to judge fines.</p>
