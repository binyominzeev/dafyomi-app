<p class="bas subject"><span class="nm">1)</span>MERITOROUS PEOPLE</p>
<p class="bas indent1"><span class="nm">(a)</span>Rava was disheartened because Abaye received Divine greetings more frequently than he.</p>
<p class="bas indent2"><span class="nm">1.</span>He was told that his own merit protected the entire (non-deserving) town.</p>
<p class="bas indent1"><span class="nm">(b)</span>R. Beruka Chaza'a would frequently be joined by Eliyahu ha'Navi. One day in the market he asked him if there was anyone present who was a Ben Olam ha'Ba and was told that there was not.</p>
<p class="bas indent1"><span class="nm">(c)</span>Later, Eliyahu pointed out a man wearing black (non-Jewish) shoes and no tzitzis.</p>
<p class="bas indent1"><span class="nm">(d)</span>R. Beruka asked the man his profession, and was told to return tomorrow.</p>
<p class="bas indent1"><span class="nm">(e)</span>The next day, the man told him that he was a jailer, and he imprisoned men and women separately, placing his bed between them.</p>
<p class="bas indent2"><span class="nm">1.</span>He would endanger himself to help a Jewish girl who was in danger from her captors.</p>
<p class="bas indent2"><span class="nm">2.</span>One betrothed Jewish girl in particular was in danger.</p>
<p class="bas indent2"><span class="nm">3.</span>He put wine lees on her skirt and told the men that she was a Nidah.</p>
<p class="bas indent2"><span class="nm">4.</span>He told R. Beruka that he dressed as a non-Jew so that he could pass amongst them undetected and learn of any decrees against the Jews in advance so as to warn them to pray.</p>
<p class="bas indent2"><span class="nm">5.</span>That was why he first told R. Beruka to return tomorrow - as he had just learned of a decree and had to hurry to warn them.</p>
<p class="bas indent1"><span class="nm">(f)</span>Meanwhile, two other people happened along, and Eliyahu said that they too were Bnei Olam ha'Ba.</p>
<p class="bas indent2"><span class="nm">1.</span>R. Beruka asked them their profession, and they replied that they were jesters who would cheer up unhappy people and smooth over disputes between people.</p>
<p class="bas subject"><span class="nm">2)</span>CROP-PLAGUE AND LOCUSTS</p>
<p class="bas indent1"><span class="nm">(a)</span>The Mishnah said that the procedure of fasting and Shofar is done in all towns if one town experiences plague on the crops, locusts, or wild animals.</p>
<p class="bas indent1"><span class="nm">(b)</span><span class="cl">(R. Akiva):</span> this is true even for the slightest amount of plague; and for locusts, even if only one was seen in Eretz Yisrael.</p>
<p class="bas subject"><span class="nm">3)</span>ANIMALS ON THE RAMPAGE</p>
<p class="bas indent1"><span class="nm">(a)</span><span class="cl">(Beraisa):</span> The crisis with wild animals spoken of refers to where they were on the rampage; otherwise, the procedure is not done.</p>
<p class="bas indent2"><span class="nm">1.</span>"On the rampage" is defined as when they are seen in the town, but not if they are seen in the wild.</p>
<p class="bas indent2"><span class="nm">2.</span>It is also defined as when they are seen by day, but not when they are seen by night.</p>
<p class="bas indent2"><span class="nm">3.</span>If an animal saw two people and chased them, it is considered to be on the rampage, but not if it fled.</p>
<p class="bas indent2"><span class="nm">4.</span>If it killed two people and ate one, it is considered to be on the rampage, but not if it ate both (in which case it is merely hungry).</p>
<p class="bas indent2"><span class="nm">5.</span>If it climbed into a house and grabbed a baby from its crib, it is considered to be on the rampage.</p>
<p class="bas indent1"><span class="nm">(b)</span><span class="cl">Question:</span> It first said that it is only on the rampage if it appears in the town, implying regardless of the time of day; yet it then says that it is only on the rampage if seen by day!?</p>
<p class="bas indent1"><span class="nm">(c)</span><span class="cl">Answer:</span> It means that if it is seen in the town, it is considered on the rampage, but only if seen by day, whereas if seen by night or in the wild even by day it is not on the rampage.</p>
<p class="bas indent1"><span class="nm">(d)</span><span class="cl">Question:</span> It said that if it chased the people, it is on the rampage, implying that if it stood still, it is not; yet then it says that if it flees, it is not on the rampage, implying that if it stood still, it is!?</p>
<p class="bas indent1"><span class="nm">(e)</span><span class="cl">Answer:</span> The first refers to a field near marshland; it feels secure on home turf, and standing still does not signify that it is dangerous; the second rule refers to where it is not near marshland.</p>
<p class="bas indent1"><span class="nm">(f)</span><span class="cl">Question:</span> The Beraisa said that it is only on the rampage if it killed two people and ate one of them, but the previous rule said that it is on the rampage if it just chases people!?</p>
<p class="bas indent1"><span class="nm">(g)</span><span class="cl">Answer:</span> This rule refers to where it is in its marshland territory, and only killing them is a sign that it is unusually dangerous.</p>
<p class="bas indent1"><span class="nm">(h)</span><span class="cl">Question:</span> The Beraisa said that if it climbed into a house and grabbed a baby from its crib, it is considered to be on the rampage - but is not this obvious?</p>
<p class="bas indent1"><span class="nm">(i)</span><span class="cl">Answer:</span> It refers to a hunter's shack, which is not perceived as proper human habitation.</p>
<p class="bas subject"><span class="nm">4)</span>FOREIGN ARMIES PASSING THROUGH</p>
<p class="bas indent1"><span class="nm">(a)</span>The Mishnah said that the procedure is done in all towns if one town encounters a foreign army.</p>
<p class="bas indent1"><span class="nm">(b)</span><span class="cl">(Beraisa):</span> This even includes an army that is travelling in peace to fight a different country.</p>
<p class="bas indent2"><span class="nm">1.</span>For there was no better such example than the army of Pharaoh-Necho, and it brought Yoshiyahu to disaster.</p>
<p class="bas bbbline">22b----------------------------------------22b</p>
<p class="bas indent2"><span class="nm">2.</span>Pharaoh-Necho said that he did not intend to fight the Jews and warned Yoshiyahu against starting trouble.</p>
<p class="bas indent2"><span class="nm">3.</span>Yoshiyahu reasoned that since Pharaoh-Necho was trusting in idols, he could defeat him.</p>
<p class="bas indent2"><span class="nm">4.</span>He was pierced with arrows like a sieve.</p>
<p class="bas indent2"><span class="nm">5.</span>Yoshiyahu was punished for not consulting Yirmiyahu.</p>
<p class="bas indent2"><span class="nm">6.</span>Yoshiyahu did not want to let them through as the Pasuk says that no sword shall pass through Eretz Yisrael, which must be referring to armies passing through in peace, as active warfare has already been ruled out by a different Pasuk.</p>
<p class="bas indent2"><span class="nm">7.</span>Yoshiyahu's mistake was that his people were not as righteous as he thought (to merit being victorious).</p>
<p class="bas indent2"><span class="nm">8.</span>When he was dying, Yirmiyahu saw him murmuring, and worried that his pain was causing him to say something inappropriate.</p>
<p class="bas indent2"><span class="nm">9.</span>Bending down, he heard Yoshiyahu accepting the justice of Hash-m's punishment, and he praised him.</p>
<p class="bas subject"><span class="nm">5)</span>CROP PLAGUE</p>
<p class="bas indent1"><span class="nm">(a)</span>The Mishnah said that a fast was decreed because crop-plague in the amount of an ovenfull was seen in Ashkelon.</p>
<p class="bas indent1"><span class="nm">(b)</span><span class="cl">Question:</span> Does this mean an oven full of produce, or the lesser amount of an oven's worth of bread?</p>
<p class="bas indent1"><span class="nm">(c)</span><span class="cl">Answer:</span> A Beraisa speaks of an oven's mouth full, which refers to bread, placed on shelves near the opening.</p>
<p class="bas indent1"><span class="nm">(d)</span><span class="cl">Question:</span> Does this mean a row of bread surrounding the opening, or reaching from the base until the opening?</p>
<p class="bas indent1"><span class="nm">(e)</span><span class="cl">Answer:</span> Teyku.</p>
<p class="bas subject"><span class="nm">6)</span>WOLVES</p>
<p class="bas indent1"><span class="nm">(a)</span>The Mishnah said that a fast was once decreed because wolves ate two children.</p>
<p class="bas indent1"><span class="nm">(b)</span>It once happened that wolves swallowed two babies whole and excreted them.</p>
<p class="bas indent1"><span class="nm">(c)</span>The Chachamim ruled that the flesh (which was digested) would not cause Tum'ah, but the bones would.</p>
<p class="bas subject"><span class="nm">7)</span>INDIVIDUAL FASTS</p>
<p class="bas indent1"><span class="nm">(a)</span><span class="cl">(Beraisa):</span> Whether a city is surrounded by non-Jews or a flooded river, or a ship is storm-tossed, or an individual is running from non-Jews or robbers or a demon possession, a person may inflict a fast upon himself.</p>
<p class="bas indent1"><span class="nm">(b)</span><span class="cl">(R. Yosi):</span> A person may not fast, in case in his weakened state he requires the support of others and they do not have mercy.</p>
<p class="bas indent2"><span class="nm">1.</span>His reason is that the Pasuk says that man became a living soul, which is a command to keep our soul alive.</p>
<p class="bas subject"><span class="nm">8)</span>PESTILENCE</p>
<p class="bas indent1"><span class="nm">(a)</span>The Mishnah stated that Shimon ha'Teimani said that the procedure is also done on Shabbos in the event of pestilence, but the Chachamim disagreed.</p>
<p class="bas indent1"><span class="nm">(b)</span><span class="cl">Question:</span> Did they only disagree about doing it on Shabbos, or did they hold that it should never be done?</p>
<p class="bas indent1"><span class="nm">(c)</span><span class="cl">Answer:</span> In a Beraisa, the Tana Kama states that it is done even on Shabbos.</p>
<p class="bas indent1"><span class="nm">(d)</span><span class="cl">(R. Chanan b. Pitam citing R. Akiva):</span> It is never done for pestilence.</p>
<p class="bas subject"><span class="nm">9)</span>OVERABUNDANT RAIN</p>
<p class="bas indent1"><span class="nm">(a)</span><span class="cl">Question:</span> The Mishnah said that the procedure is done to protect from all forms of suffering except an overabundance of rain - why?</p>
<p class="bas indent1"><span class="nm">(b)</span><span class="cl">Answer (R. Yochanan):</span> As we do not pray about too much of a good thing.</p>
<p class="bas indent2"><span class="nm">1.</span>This is learned from a Pasuk in which Hash-m promises too much Berachah.</p>
<p class="bas indent1"><span class="nm">(c)</span><span class="cl">(Rami bar Rav):</span> In Bavel, however, they do pray about too much rain.</p>
<p class="bas indent2"><span class="nm">1.</span>Likewise, a Beraisa states that in a rainy year, the men of the Mishmar would tell the men of the Maimad to pray on behalf of those in Bavel that their houses should not drown them.</p>
<p class="bas indent1"><span class="nm">(d)</span><span class="cl">Question:</span> At what point do we pray that the rain should stop?</p>
<p class="bas indent1"><span class="nm">(e)</span><span class="cl">Answer (R. Eliezer):</span> When a person can stand on the high stone of Keren Afel and dip his feet in the water (i.e. never).</p>
<p class="bas indent2"><span class="nm">1.</span><span class="cl">Question:</span> A Beraisa speaks instead of dipping his hands in?</p>
<p class="bas indent2"><span class="nm">2.</span><span class="cl">Answer:</span> When you can dip your feet in, you can also bend and dip your hands in.</p>
<p class="bas indent2"><span class="nm">3.</span><span class="cl">(Rabah bar Chanah):</span> Standing on Keren Afel, a merchant riding a camel and brandishing a spear looks like a worm.</p>
