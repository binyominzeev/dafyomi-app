<p class="bas subject"><span class="nm">1)</span>A LONG <i>NEZIRUS</i></p>
<p class="bas indent1"><span class="nm">(a)</span><span class="cl">(Mishnah):</span> If one said 'I am a Nazir for one long term' or 'I am a Nazir for one short term', even if he said 'from here to the end of the world', he is a Nazir for 30 days.</p>
<p class="bas indent1"><span class="nm">(b)</span><span class="cl">(Gemara) Question:</span> Why is he a Nazir for only 30 days? He said 'until the end of the world'!</p>
<p class="bas indent1"><span class="nm">(c)</span><span class="cl">Answer #1:</span> He meant, one (standard) Nezirus for me is like until the end of the world.</p>
<p class="bas indent1"><span class="nm">(d)</span><span class="cl">(Mishnah):</span> If one said 'I am a Nazir from here until a certain place', we estimate how many days journey it is until that place;</p>
<p class="bas indent2"><span class="nm">1.</span>If it is less than 30 days, he is a Nazir for 30 days. If it is more than 30 days, he is a Nazir for that time.</p>
<p class="bas indent1"><span class="nm">(e)</span><span class="cl">Question:</span> Why don't we say that he meant, one (standard) Nezirus for me is like until that place!</p>
<p class="bas indent1"><span class="nm">(f)</span><span class="cl">Answer (Rava):</span> The case is, he already started on the way.</p>
<p class="bas indent1"><span class="nm">(g)</span><span class="cl">Question:</span> We should say that he accepted one term of Nezirus for each Parsah (the standard unit of distance, about four kilometers. This question is based on the Mishnah below (i:1), which holds that he accepted one Nezirus for each hair on his head.)</p>
<p class="bas indent1"><span class="nm">(h)</span><span class="cl">Answer (Rav Papa):</span> It is in a place where a Parsah is not a standard unit of measure.</p>
<p class="bas indent1"><span class="nm">(i)</span><span class="cl">Question:</span> We should say that he accepted one term of Nezirus for each lodging station (which are spaced a day's journey apart)!</p>
<p class="bas indent2"><span class="nm">1.</span><span class="cl">(Mishnah):</span> If one said 'I am a Nazir like the dirt of the ground', 'like the hairs on my head', or 'like the sand by the sea', he is a Nazir Olam, and shaves once every 30 days.</p>
<p class="bas indent1"><span class="nm">(j)</span><span class="cl">Answer #1:</span> When he attributes the Nezirus to something that we can count, we say that he accepted one long Nezirus of that duration.</p>
<p class="bas indent2"><span class="nm">1.</span><span class="cl">(Beraisa):</span> If one said 'I am a Nazir all the days of my life' or 'I am a Nazir Olam', he is a Nazir Olam;</p>
<p class="bas indent2"><span class="nm">2.</span>Even if he said '100 years' or '1000 years', he is not a Nazir Olam, rather a Nazir l'Olam (i.e. his term of Nezirus will never end).</p>
<p class="bas indent1"><span class="nm">(k)</span><span class="cl">Answer #2 (Rabah):</span> Hairs of his head are different, for they are discrete (separated from each other).</p>
<p class="bas indent1"><span class="nm">(l)</span><span class="cl">Question:</span> Also days are discrete - "it was evening and it was morning, one day"! (This separates it from the second day.)</p>
<p class="bas indent1"><span class="nm">(m)</span><span class="cl">Answer:</span> Days are not discrete. The verse merely teaches that the evening is part of the coming day.</p>
<p class="bas indent1"><span class="nm">(n)</span><span class="cl">Answer #3 (Rava):</span> There is no difficulty! The Seifa ('from here until the end of the world') applies to the Reisha, in which he said 'I am a Nazir for one term.'</p>
<p class="bas subject"><span class="nm">2)</span>ACCEPTING MORE THAN ONE TERM OF <i>NEZIRUS</i></p>
<p class="bas indent1"><span class="nm">(a)</span><span class="cl">(Mishnah):</span> If one said 'I am a Nazir and one day' or 'I am a Nazir and one hour' or 'I am a Nazir once and a half', he is a Nazir twice.</p>
<p class="bas indent1"><span class="nm">(b)</span><span class="cl">(Gemara) Question:</span> Why must the Mishnah teach all three cases?</p>
<p class="bas indent1"><span class="nm">(c)</span><span class="cl">Answer:</span> Had it taught only 'I am a Nazir and one day', one might have thought that this is because Nezirus cannot be for one day, but if he said 'I am a Nazir and an hour', it suffices to add a 31st day for the extra hour;</p>
<p class="bas indent2"><span class="nm">1.</span>Therefore it taught that 'I am a Nazir and one hour' makes him a Nazir twice.</p>
<p class="bas bbbline">7b----------------------------------------7b</p>
<p class="bas indent2"><span class="nm">2.</span>Had it taught only 'I am a Nazir and one hour', we would have thought that because he is in any case imprecise (Nezirus is always a whole number of days), he is a Nazir twice, but if he said 'I  am a Nazir once and a half', this can be fulfilled precisely, i.e. he will be a Nazir for 45 days!</p>
<p class="bas indent3"><span class="nm">i.</span>The Mishnah teaches that in all cases, he is a Nazir twice.</p>
<p class="bas indent1"><span class="nm">(d)</span><span class="cl">(Mishnah):</span> If one said 'I am a Nazir 30 days and an hour', he is a Nazir for 31 days, since a term of Nezirus is (a whole number of) days, not hours.</p>
<p class="bas indent1"><span class="nm">(e)</span><span class="cl">(Gemara - Rav):</span> We can infer from the Mishnah that if he said 'I am a Nazir 30 and one days', he is a Nazir for 31 days. However, if he said 'I am a Nazir 30 days and one day', he is a Nazir twice.</p>
<p class="bas indent1"><span class="nm">(f)</span>Rav holds like R. Akiva, who expounds superfluous words.</p>
<p class="bas indent2"><span class="nm">1.</span><span class="cl">(Mishnah - R. Akiva):</span> One (who sold his house) did not sell the pit or cistern, even if he wrote 'the depth and height.' However, the seller did not retain a path to them, and he must buy this from the buyer;</p>
<p class="bas indent2"><span class="nm">2.</span>Chachamim say, he retained a path to them;</p>
<p class="bas indent2"><span class="nm">3.</span>R. Akiva agrees that if he said '(I sell the house) except for the pit and cistern', he retained a path to them.</p>
