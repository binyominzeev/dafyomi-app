<p class="bas subject"><span class="nm">1)</span>CONDITIONS OF THE <i>SEH</i></p>
<p class="bas indent1"><span class="nm">(a)</span><span class="cl">(Mishnah):</span> One may not redeem a Peter Chamor with any of the following (b'Toras Seh, i.e. even if it is worth less than the donkey);</p>
<p class="bas indent2"><span class="nm">1.</span>A calf, Chayah, slaughtered animal, Terefah, Kil'ayim (a crossbreed of a goat and sheep), or Koy (this will be explained);</p>
<p class="bas indent2"><span class="nm">2.</span>R. Eliezer permits using Kil'ayim, for it is a Seh, and forbids a Koy, for it is a Safek.</p>
<p class="bas indent1"><span class="nm">(b)</span>If one gave the Peter Chamor itself to the Kohen, the Kohen may not keep it until the Yisrael designates a Seh to redeem it.</p>
<p class="bas indent1"><span class="nm">(c)</span><span class="cl">(Gemara) Question:</span> Who is the Tana of the Mishnah?</p>
<p class="bas indent1"><span class="nm">(d)</span><span class="cl">Answer:</span> It is Ben Bag Bag;</p>
<p class="bas indent2"><span class="nm">1.</span><span class="cl">(Beraisa - Ben Bag Bag):</span> It says "Seh" regarding redemption of a Peter Chamor, like it says regarding Korban Pesach;</p>
<p class="bas indent3"><span class="nm">i.</span>Just like each of these (in the Mishnah) is Pasul for Korban Pesach, it may not be used to redeem.</p>
<p class="bas indent2"><span class="nm">2.</span><span class="cl">Suggestion:</span> Korban Pesach must be an unblemished male in its first year. Perhaps this is required also for redemption!</p>
<p class="bas indent2"><span class="nm">3.</span><span class="cl">Rejection:</span> It says "Tifdeh" twice, to teach that these are not required.</p>
<p class="bas indent2"><span class="nm">4.</span><span class="cl">Question:</span> If so, we should be Machshir even the cases listed in the Mishnah!</p>
<p class="bas indent2"><span class="nm">5.</span><span class="cl">Answer:</span> If so, the Gezeirah Shavah "Seh-Seh" would not teach anything. (We include a Ba'al Mum, a female and a Seh after its first year, for they are Seiyin.)</p>
<p class="bas indent1"><span class="nm">(e)</span><span class="cl">Question:</span> Can one redeem with a Ben Paku'a (a fetus found inside a slaughtered animal)?</p>
<p class="bas indent2"><span class="nm">1.</span>According to R. Meir, clearly one can. Since it must be slaughtered, it is a fully fledged Seh;</p>
<p class="bas indent2"><span class="nm">2.</span>The question is according to Chachamim. Do we say since it became permitted through its mother's Shechitah, it is called meat (and not a Seh);</p>
<p class="bas indent3"><span class="nm">i.</span>Or, since it runs around, it is called a Seh?</p>
<p class="bas indent1"><span class="nm">(f)</span><span class="cl">Answer #1 (Mar Zutra):</span> It cannot be used.</p>
<p class="bas indent1"><span class="nm">(g)</span><span class="cl">Answer #2 (Rav Ashi):</span> It can be used.</p>
<p class="bas indent2"><span class="nm">1.</span><span class="cl">Question (Rav Ashi to Mar Zutra):</span> Do you learn from a Gezeirah Shavah Seh-Seh from Korban Pesach (for which Ben Peku'ah is invalid)?</p>
<p class="bas indent3"><span class="nm">i.</span>If so, you should require all the qualifications for the Korban Pesach, i.e. an unblemished male in its first year!</p>
<p class="bas indent2"><span class="nm">2.</span><span class="cl">Answer:</span> It says "Tifdeh" twice to include even a Seh invalid for Pesach.</p>
<p class="bas indent2"><span class="nm">3.</span><span class="cl">Question:</span> If so, it should include also a Ben Peku'ah!</p>
<p class="bas indent2"><span class="nm">4.</span><span class="cl">Answer:</span> This cannot be, for then the Gezeirah Shavah would not teach anything.</p>
<p class="bas indent1"><span class="nm">(h)</span><span class="cl">Question:</span> May one redeem with a Nidmeh (an animal that does not resemble its mother)?</p>
<p class="bas indent2"><span class="nm">1.</span>We do not ask according to R. Eliezer. He permits even with Kil'ayim, and all the more so Nidmeh! (R. Gershom - both of its parents are the same species, the it is better.)</p>
<p class="bas indent2"><span class="nm">2.</span>We ask according to Chachamim. Perhaps they forbid only Kil'ayim, but permit Nidmeh;</p>
<p class="bas indent2"><span class="nm">3.</span>Or, perhaps they forbid both of them!</p>
<p class="bas indent1"><span class="nm">(i)</span><span class="cl">Answer #1 (Beraisa):</span> If a cow gave birth to a goat, it may not be used to redeem.</p>
<p class="bas indent2"><span class="nm">1.</span><span class="cl">Inference:</span> If a sheep gave birth to a goat, it may be used to redeem!</p>
<p class="bas indent2"><span class="nm">2.</span><span class="cl">Question:</span> Who is the Tana of the Beraisa?</p>
<p class="bas indent3"><span class="nm">i.</span>It cannot be R. Eliezer. He permits even with Kil'ayim!</p>
<p class="bas indent2"><span class="nm">3.</span><span class="cl">Answer #1:</span> It is Chachamim.</p>
<p class="bas indent1"><span class="nm">(j)</span><span class="cl">Rejection (and Answer #2 to Question i:2):</span> Really, it is R. Eliezer. He teaches that a goat born to a cow is invalid. (Indeed, the inference is not a Chidush);</p>
<p class="bas indent2"><span class="nm">1.</span>One might have thought that the law depends on the child, and since it is a Seh, it may be used. The Beraisa teaches that this is not so. The mother determines the law; the child is a calf.</p>
<p class="bas indent1"><span class="nm">(k)</span><span class="cl">Answer #2 (Rabah bar Shmuel - Beraisa) Question:</span> What is the case of Kil'ayim?</p>
<p class="bas indent2"><span class="nm">1.</span><span class="cl">Answer:</span> It is a goat born to a ewe. The father was a Seh. (From the next question, it is clear that here, 'Seh' refers to a ram. I do not know why the Gemara did not explicitly say 'ram'.)</p>
<p class="bas indent2"><span class="nm">2.</span><span class="cl">Objection:</span> This is not Kil'ayim. It is Nidmeh!</p>
<p class="bas indent2"><span class="nm">3.</span><span class="cl">Correction:</span> Rather, what is the case of a Nidmeh that Chachamim equated to Kil'ayim? It is a goat born to a ewe. The father was a Seh.</p>
<p class="bas indent2"><span class="nm">4.</span><span class="cl">Question:</span> Regarding what it is considered Kil'ayim?</p>
<p class="bas indent2"><span class="nm">5.</span><span class="cl">Answer #1:</span> It is Kil'ayim (and therefore Pasul) regarding Kodshim.</p>
<p class="bas indent2"><span class="nm">6.</span><span class="cl">Rejection:</span> The same verse that disqualifies Kil'ayim disqualifies Nidmeh!</p>
<p class="bas indent3"><span class="nm">i.</span><span class="cl">(Beraisa):</span> "Shor Oh Kesev" excludes Kil'ayim. "Oh Ez" excludes Nidmeh.</p>
<p class="bas indent2"><span class="nm">7.</span><span class="cl">Answer #2:</span> It is Kil'ayim regarding Bechor. (It does not become Kadosh).</p>
<p class="bas indent2"><span class="nm">8.</span><span class="cl">Rejection:</span> A verse directly excludes Nidmeh - "Ach Bechor Shor... ," both it and its mother must be cattle (or both sheep, or both goats).</p>
<p class="bas indent2"><span class="nm">9.</span><span class="cl">Answer #3:</span> It is Kil'ayim to be exempt from Ma'aser.</p>
<p class="bas indent2"><span class="nm">10.</span><span class="cl">Rejection:</span> We learn from a Gezeirah Shavah "Tachas-Tachas" from Kodshim (to exempt Nidmeh)!</p>
<p class="bas indent2"><span class="nm">11.</span><span class="cl">Answer #4:</span> It is Kil'ayim regarding Pidyon Peter Chamor. (This culminates Answer #2 to Question (h).)</p>
<p class="bas indent1"><span class="nm">(l)</span><span class="cl">Rejection (and Support of Answer #3):</span> Really, it is Kil'ayim regarding Ma'aser. The case is, it slightly resembles its mother;</p>
<p class="bas indent2"><span class="nm">1.</span>One might have thought that we learn "Ha'avarah-Ha'avarah" from Bechor (such a child gets Kedushas Bechor like a Ba'al Mum. It is given to Kohanim. Likewise, such a child should enter the pen to be tithed.) The Tana teaches that this is not so. We learn "Tachas-Tachas" from Kodshim.</p>
<p class="bas indent1"><span class="nm">(m)</span><span class="cl">Question:</span> May one redeem with Pesulei ha'Mukdashim (a Ba'al Mum that was redeemed)?</p>
<p class="bas indent2"><span class="nm">1.</span>We do not ask according to R. Shimon. He permits benefit from a Peter Chamor. It is Chulin. (There is no reason not to use Pesulei ha'Mukdashim);</p>
<p class="bas indent2"><span class="nm">2.</span>We ask according to R. Yehudah;</p>
<p class="bas indent3"><span class="nm">i.</span>Since he forbids Hana'ah of a Peter Chamor, Ein Isur Chal Al Isur (the Isur on the donkey cannot take effect, even for a moment, on Pesulei ha'Mukdashim, which is already Asur. The only Heter is to slaughter and eat it);</p>
<p class="bas indent3"><span class="nm">ii.</span>Or, since the Seh permits the Peter Chamor without becoming forbidden itself, Ein Isur Chal Al Isur does not apply. It may be used!</p>
<p class="bas indent1"><span class="nm">(n)</span><span class="cl">Answer (Rav Mari brei d'Rav Kahana):</span> Pesulei ha'Mukdashim may be eaten "ka'Tzvi vecha'Ayal." Just like Chayos may not be used to redeem (b'Toras Seh), also Pesulei ha'Mukdashim.</p>
<p class="bas indent1"><span class="nm">(o)</span><span class="cl">Retraction:</span> This shows that even R. Shimon disqualifies it (unlike our original assumption)!</p>

<p class="bas subject"><span class="nm">2)</span>KEDUSHAS SHEMITAH</p>
<p class="bas indent1"><span class="nm">(a)</span><span class="cl">Question:</span> May one redeem with a Seh (bought with produce or money) of Shemitah?</p>
<p class="bas indent2"><span class="nm">1.</span>Surely, it may not be used to redeem a definite Peter Chamor. Since the Kohen keeps the Seh, this would be like commerce. (Anything with Kedushas) Shemitah is for eating, and not for business!</p>
<p class="bas indent2"><span class="nm">2.</span>We ask about redeeming a Safek.</p>
<p class="bas indent2"><span class="nm">3.</span>We do not ask according to R. Shimon. Since he permits benefit from a Peter Chamor, there is no need to designate a Seh for a Safek;</p>
<p class="bas indent2"><span class="nm">4.</span>We ask according to R. Yehudah;</p>
<p class="bas indent3"><span class="nm">i.</span>Since the Yisrael keeps the Seh, this is called "Le'achlah";</p>
<p class="bas indent3"><span class="nm">ii.</span>Or, since the Peter Chamor is forbidden until designating the Seh, this is like business!</p>
<p class="bas indent1"><span class="nm">(b)</span><span class="cl">Answer:</span> Rav Chisda taught that a Shemitah animal is exempt from Bechorah. Matanos (the foreleg, jaw and stomach) must be given;</p>
<p class="bas indent2"><span class="nm">1.</span>It is exempt from Bechorah. Shemitah is for eating, and not for burning (the Eimurim);</p>
<p class="bas indent2"><span class="nm">2.</span>Matanos must be given. They are for Kohanim to eat!</p>
<p class="bas indent1"><span class="nm">(c)</span><span class="cl">Question (Mishnah):</span> One who eats from a Shemitah dough before separating Chalah is Chayav Misah (b'Yedei Shamayim).</p>
<p class="bas indent2"><span class="nm">1.</span>If the Chalah would become (Rashi; Tosfos - if the dough was) Tamei, the Chalah would have to be burned. We should say that the dough is exempt from Chalah, for Shemitah is to be eaten, and not burned!</p>
<p class="bas indent1"><span class="nm">(d)</span><span class="cl">Answer:</span> Chalah applies to a Shemitah dough, for it says "l'Doroseichem." (at all times, i.e. even in Shemitah).</p>
<p class="bas indent1"><span class="nm">(e)</span><span class="cl">Support (Beraisa) Question:</span> What is the source that one who eats from a Shemitah dough before separating Chalah is Chayav Misah?</p>
<p class="bas indent2"><span class="nm">1.</span><span class="cl">Answer:</span> It says "l'Doroseichem."</p>
<p class="bas indent1"><span class="nm">(f)</span><span class="cl">Question:</span> We should learn from Chalah to Bechorah!</p>
<p class="bas indent1"><span class="nm">(g)</span><span class="cl">Answer:</span> L'Chatchilah, Chalah is not burned (unless it became Tamei), but Eimurei Bechor must be burned.</p>
<p class="bas subject"><span class="nm">3)</span>GIVING THE <i>PIDYON</i> OR THE <i>PETER CHAMOR</i> TO A KOHEN</p>
<p class="bas indent1"><span class="nm">(a)</span><span class="cl">(Mishnah):</span> If one gave the Peter Chamor itself to the Kohen, he may not keep it until he designates a Seh to redeem it.</p>
<p class="bas indent1"><span class="nm">(b)</span>Our Mishnah teaches like the following Beraisa;</p>
<p class="bas indent2"><span class="nm">1.</span><span class="cl">(Beraisa):</span> If a Yisrael had a Peter Chamor in his house, and a Kohen said "give it to me. I will redeem it," the Yisrael should not consent unless he sees the Kohen redeem it.</p>
<p class="bas indent1"><span class="nm">(c)</span><span class="cl">(Rav Nachman):</span> This teaches that Kohanim are suspected of using a Peter Chamor before redeeming it.</p>
<p class="bas indent1"><span class="nm">(d)</span><span class="cl">Objection:</span> This is obvious!</p>
<p class="bas indent1"><span class="nm">(e)</span><span class="cl">Answer:</span> One might have thought that this applies only to Kohanim known to be suspected (alternatively - who transgressed);</p>
<p class="bas indent2"><span class="nm">1.</span>Rav Nachman teaches that it applies to all Kohanim, for they rationalize. (They think that since they keep the Seh, there is no need to redeem.)</p>
<p class="bas indent1"><span class="nm">(f)</span><span class="cl">(Mishnah - R. Eliezer):</span> If one designated a Seh to redeem a Peter Chamor and the Seh died, he has Acharayus (he must give a different Seh to a Kohen), just like there is Acharayus for the five Shekalim of Pidyon ha'Ben;</p>
<p class="bas indent1"><span class="nm">(g)</span>Chachamim say he has no Acharayus, just like there is no Acharayus for Ma'aser Sheni.</p>
<p class="bas indent1"><span class="nm">(h)</span>R. Yehoshua and R. Tzadok testified that if the Seh died, the Kohen does not receive anything (except for the carcass).</p>
<p class="bas indent1"><span class="nm">(i)</span>R. Eliezer says, if the Peter Chamor died, it is buried. One may benefit from the Seh. (The Yisrael keeps it);</p>
<p class="bas indent1"><span class="nm">(j)</span>Chachamim say, the Peter Chamor need not be buried. The Seh is given to a Kohen.</p>
<p class="bas indent1"><span class="nm">(k)</span><span class="cl">(Gemara - Rav Yosef):</span> R. Eliezer learns from "Ach Pado Tifdeh... " The verse equates Peter Chamor to Bechor Adam;</p>
<p class="bas indent2"><span class="nm">1.</span>Just like there is Acharayus for Pidyon ha'Ben, also for Pidyon Peter Chamor.</p>
<p class="bas indent1"><span class="nm">(l)</span><span class="cl">Question (Abaye):</span> If so, we should also permit benefit from a Peter Chamor (before redemption), just like from Bechor Adam!</p>
<p class="bas indent2"><span class="nm">1.</span><span class="cl">Suggestion:</span> Perhaps R. Eliezer indeed permits this (like R. Shimon)!</p>
<p class="bas indent2"><span class="nm">2.</span><span class="cl">Rejection #1 (Mishnah - R. Eliezer):</span> If the Peter Chamor died, it is buried.</p>
<p class="bas indent3"><span class="nm">i.</span>It is buried because it is Asur b'Hana'ah.</p>
<p class="bas indent3"><span class="nm">ii.</span><span class="cl">Suggestion:</span> Perhaps it is permitted. It is buried because it is equated to Bechor Adam. (People are normally buried!)</p>
<p class="bas indent3"><span class="nm">iii.</span><span class="cl">Rejection:</span> Not only Bechoros are buried. (The Hekesh should teach things particular to Bechor Adam).</p>
<p class="bas indent2"><span class="nm">3.</span><span class="cl">Rejection #2 (Beraisa):</span> R. Eliezer agrees that if a Yisrael has a Safek Peter Chamor, he designates a Seh and keeps it. (This is necessary only if the Peter Chamor is Asur b'Hana'ah!)</p>
<p class="bas indent1"><span class="nm">(m)</span><span class="cl">Answer (Rava):</span> "Ach Pado Sifdeh" equates Peter Chamor to Bechor Adam only regarding Pidyon (e.g. Acharayus, but not regarding Hana'ah).</p>
<p class="bas indent1"><span class="nm">(n)</span><span class="cl">(Beraisa #1):</span> Erchin (a vow to give to Hekdesh a certain amount based on the age and gender of oneself or another person, the Ne'erach) is according to (his age at) the time of the vow;</p>
<p class="bas indent2"><span class="nm">1.</span>Pidyon ha'Ben applies after 30 days. Pidyon Peter Chamor applies immediately.</p>
<p class="bas indent1"><span class="nm">(o)</span><span class="cl">Contradiction (Beraisa #2):</span> At least 30 days are required for all of the following:</p>
<p class="bas indent2"><span class="nm">1.</span>Erchin (the Ne'erach must be at least 30 days old), Pidyon ha'Ben, Nezirus, and Pidyon Peter Chamor.</p>
<p class="bas indent2"><span class="nm">2.</span>These have no upper limit (the age of the Ne'erach, the length of Nezirus, or the time to redeem a son or Peter Chamor).</p>
<p class="bas indent1"><span class="nm">(p)</span><span class="cl">Resolution #1 (Rav Nachman):</span> Beraisa #1 teaches that if Pidyon Peter Chamor was done immediately (i.e. before 30 days), it is valid (b'Di'eved).</p>
<p class="bas indent2"><span class="nm">1.</span><span class="cl">Question:</span> This implies that Pidyon ha'Ben is invalid even b'Di'eved within 30 days. Rav was Machshir such a Pidyon!</p>
<p class="bas indent2"><span class="nm">2.</span><span class="cl">Answer (Rava):</span> If he said that the Pidyon should take effect immediately, all agree that it is invalid. (Rav is Machshir when he gave the money now to take effect after 30 days.)</p>
