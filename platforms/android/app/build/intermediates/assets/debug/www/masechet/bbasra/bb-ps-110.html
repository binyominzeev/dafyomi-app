<p class="bas subject"><span class="nm">1)</span>THE IMPORTANCE OF LINEAGE (cont.)</p>
<p class="bas indent1"><span class="nm">(a)</span><span class="cl">Answer #2:</span> Rather, Pinchas descended from both Yisro and Yosef, from one on the father's side, and from the other on the mother's side.</p>
<p class="bas indent2"><span class="nm">1.</span><span class="cl">Support:</span> "Mi'Ben<i>os</i> Puti'el" implies from two (people called Puti'el).</p>
<p class="bas indent1"><span class="nm">(b)</span><span class="cl">(Rava):</span> One must check a woman's brothers before marrying her - "va'Yikach Aharon Es Elisheva Bas Aminadav Achos Nachshon";</p>
<p class="bas indent2"><span class="nm">1.</span><span class="cl">Question:</span> Since the verse calls her Aminadav's daughter, we know that she is Nachshon's sister!</p>
<p class="bas indent2"><span class="nm">2.</span><span class="cl">Answer:</span> It says "Achos Nachshon" to teach that one must check a woman's brothers before marrying her.</p>
<p class="bas indent1"><span class="nm">(c)</span><span class="cl">(Beraisa):</span> Most sons resemble the mother's brothers.</p>
<p class="bas subject"><span class="nm">2)</span>YONASON ERRED AND REPENTED</p>
<p class="bas indent1"><span class="nm">(a)</span>"Mi Hevi'acha Halom, u'Mah Atah Oseh ba'Zeh, u'Mah Lecha Po"- they asked him, don't you descend from Moshe, about whom it says "Al Tikrav Halom", "Mah Zeh b'Yadecha", and "v'Atah Po Amod Imadi"? Will you become a Kohen to idolatry?!</p>
<p class="bas indent2"><span class="nm">1.</span><span class="cl">Yonason:</span> I have a tradition from Moshe that it is better to hire himself out and do <i>Avodah Zarah</i>, than to be supported by others.</p>
<p class="bas indent2"><span class="nm">2.</span>He thought that this means idolatry. Really, it means work that is foreign to him.</p>
<p class="bas indent2"><span class="nm">3.</span><span class="cl">Rav (to Rav Kahana):</span> Flay a carcass in the market for wages. Do not consider yourself too important, and that this is a disgrace for you.</p>
<p class="bas indent1"><span class="nm">(b)</span>When David saw how much Yonason liked money, he appointed him over the treasuries - "u'Shevu'el ben Gershom ben Moshe Nagid Al ha'Otzaros."</p>
<p class="bas indent1"><span class="nm">(c)</span><span class="cl">Question:</span> Why does the verse call him "Shevu'el"?</p>
<p class="bas indent1"><span class="nm">(d)</span><span class="cl">Answer (R. Yochanan):</span> He returned to Hash-m (Shav la'Kel) with all his heart.</p>
<p class="bas subject"><span class="nm">3)</span>SONS INHERIT THE FATHER</p>
<p class="bas indent1"><span class="nm">(a)</span><span class="cl">(Mishnah):</span> Sons inherit their father ...</p>
<p class="bas indent1"><span class="nm">(b)</span><span class="cl">Question:</span> What is the source for this?</p>
<p class="bas indent1"><span class="nm">(c)</span><span class="cl">Answer #1:</span> "Ish Ki Yamus u'Ven Ein Lo" implies that if he had a son, the son would be first to inherit.</p>
<p class="bas indent2"><span class="nm">1.</span><span class="cl">Question (Rav Papa):</span> Why don't we say that if there is only a son or daughter, he or she inherits, but if there are both, neither inherits?</p>
<p class="bas bbbline">110b----------------------------------------110b</p>
<p class="bas indent2"><span class="nm">2.</span><span class="cl">Objection (Abaye):</span> When there are both, who should inherit? Will the mayor inherit?!</p>
<p class="bas indent2"><span class="nm">3.</span><span class="cl">Clarification (Rav Papa):</span> I meant that neither would inherit alone, rather, they would split the inheritance.</p>
<p class="bas indent2"><span class="nm">4.</span><span class="cl">Answer (Abaye):</span> We do not need a verse to teach that a lone son inherits everything.</p>
<p class="bas indent2"><span class="nm">5.</span><span class="cl">Question:</span> Perhaps the verse teaches that a daughter also inherits?</p>
<p class="bas indent2"><span class="nm">6.</span><span class="cl">Answer:</span> That is learned from "v'Chol Bas Yoreshes Nachalah."</p>
<p class="bas indent1"><span class="nm">(d)</span><span class="cl">Answer #2 (Rav Acha bar Yakov):</span> We learn that sons inherit from "Lamah Yigara Shem Avinu... Ki Ein Lo Ben."</p>
<p class="bas indent2"><span class="nm">1.</span><span class="cl">Inference:</span> Had he had a son, the son alone would inherit.</p>
<p class="bas indent1"><span class="nm">(e)</span><span class="cl">Rejection:</span> That is no proof. Perhaps Tzelafchad's daughters thought so, but the Torah teaches differently!</p>
<p class="bas indent2"><span class="nm">1.</span>Rather, we must rely on Answer #1.</p>
<p class="bas indent1"><span class="nm">(f)</span><span class="cl">Answer #3 (Ravina):</span> We learn from "ha'Karov Elav" - the closest one inherits.</p>
<p class="bas indent2"><span class="nm">1.</span>The son is closer than the daughter, for he stands in place of his father regarding Yi'ud (marrying an Amah Ivriyah) and (redeeming) an inherited field.</p>
<p class="bas indent1"><span class="nm">(g)</span><span class="cl">Rejection:</span> Yi'ud does not prove that the son is closer, since it is not applicable to a daughter. We know that a son stands in place of his father regarding an inherited field only from the fact that he precedes the daughter regarding inheritance!</p>
<p class="bas indent2"><span class="nm">1.</span>Rather, we must rely on Answer #1.</p>
<p class="bas indent1"><span class="nm">(h)</span><span class="cl">Answer #4:</span> "V'Hisnachaltem Osam li'<i>Vneichem</i> Achareichem" - you will bequeath slaves to your sons, but not to your daughters.</p>
<p class="bas indent1"><span class="nm">(i)</span><span class="cl">Question:</span> If so, we should also expound "Lema'an Yirbu Yemeichem vi'Mei <i>Veneichem</i>" to exclude your daughters?!</p>
<p class="bas indent1"><span class="nm">(j)</span><span class="cl">Answer:</span> Regarding a blessing, it is illogical to expound to exclude daughters.</p>
<p class="bas subject"><span class="nm">4)</span>BROTHERS INHERIT EACH OTHER</p>
<p class="bas indent1"><span class="nm">(a)</span><span class="cl">(Mishnah):</span> Paternal brothers inherit each other ...</p>
<p class="bas indent1"><span class="nm">(b)</span><span class="cl">Question:</span> What is the source of this?</p>
<p class="bas indent1"><span class="nm">(c)</span><span class="cl">Answer (Rabah):</span> We learn a Gezeirah Shavah "Achvah-Achvah" from Yakov's sons.</p>
<p class="bas indent2"><span class="nm">1.</span>Just like Yakov's sons were paternal but not (all) maternal brothers, also brothers mentioned regarding inheritance must be paternal.</p>
<p class="bas indent1"><span class="nm">(d)</span><span class="cl">Question:</span> Why is the Gezeirah Shavah needed? We can learn from "mi'Mishpachto v'Yorash Osah!" (We said above (109b) that 'Mishpachah' refers to the father's family.)</p>
<p class="bas indent1"><span class="nm">(e)</span><span class="cl">Answer:</span> True! In truth, Rabah's Gezeirah Shavah teaches about Yibum.</p>
