<p class="bas subject"><span class="nm">1)</span>WHAT IS INCLUDED IN A CHATZER</p>
<p class="bas indent1"><span class="nm">(a)</span><span class="cl">(Mishnah):</span> If one sells a Chatzer, he sells the houses, pits and caves, but not Metaltelim;</p>
<p class="bas indent1"><span class="nm">(b)</span>If he said 'it and everything inside', all these are included;</p>
<p class="bas indent1"><span class="nm">(c)</span>In any case, he did not sell the bathhouse or olivepress;</p>
<p class="bas indent1"><span class="nm">(d)</span>R. Eliezer says, one who sells a Chatzer sells only the level ground (but not houses or pits).</p>
<p class="bas indent1"><span class="nm">(e)</span><span class="cl">(Gemara - Beraisa):</span> If one sells a Chatzer, he sells the outer and inner houses and sand patches;</p>
<p class="bas indent1"><span class="nm">(f)</span>Stores that open to it are included, but not stores that do not open to it;</p>
<p class="bas indent2"><span class="nm">1.</span>Stores that open to it and to another Chatzer are sold.</p>
<p class="bas indent2"><span class="nm">2.</span>R. Eliezer says, one who sells a Chatzer sells only the ground.</p>
<p class="bas indent1"><span class="nm">(g)</span><span class="cl">Question:</span> The Beraisa said that stores that open to it and to another Chatzer are sold. R. Chiya taught that they are not sold with it!</p>
<p class="bas indent1"><span class="nm">(h)</span><span class="cl">Answer:</span> They are sold only if most of their use is in the Chatzer that was sold.</p>
<p class="bas indent1"><span class="nm">(i)</span><span class="cl">(Mishnah):</span> R. Eliezer says, one who sells a Chatzer sold only the level ground.</p>
<p class="bas indent1"><span class="nm">(j)</span><span class="cl">Version #1 (Rava):</span> If he called it 'Dirta' (a dwelling), all agree that houses are included;</p>
<p class="bas indent2"><span class="nm">1.</span>They argue when he called it 'Darta' (the Arame'ic translation of Chatzer). R. Eliezer says, this connotes the level ground;</p>
<p class="bas indent2"><span class="nm">2.</span>Chachamim say, it connotes houses.</p>
<p class="bas indent1"><span class="nm">(k)</span><span class="cl">Version #2 (Rava):</span> If he called it 'Darta', all agree that houses are included;</p>
<p class="bas indent2"><span class="nm">1.</span><span class="cl">They argue when he called it 'Chatzer':</span> R. Eliezer says that Chatzer connotes the level ground;</p>
<p class="bas indent2"><span class="nm">2.</span>Chachamim say, this is like the Chatzer of the Mishkan (which included the Mishkan).</p>
<p class="bas indent1"><span class="nm">(l)</span><span class="cl">Version #1 (Rava):</span> If one sells a sand patch and property by the river (from which one gets gold or silver, or fish), a Chazakah in one does not acquire the other.</p>
<p class="bas indent1"><span class="nm">(m)</span><span class="cl">Question:</span> Shmuel taught that if Reuven buys 10 fields in 10 countries from Shimon, once he makes Chazakah in one of them, he acquires all of them!</p>
<p class="bas indent1"><span class="nm">(n)</span><span class="cl">Answer:</span> There, since they all serve the same purpose, and all land is connected, one Kinyan suffices;</p>
<p class="bas indent2"><span class="nm">1.</span>Here, they serve different purposes, so they are not acquired together.</p>

<p class="bas indent1"><span class="nm">(o)</span><span class="cl">Version #2 (Rava):</span> If one sells a sand patch and property by the river, a Chazakah in one acquires the other.</p>
<p class="bas indent1"><span class="nm">(p)</span><span class="cl">Objection:</span> This is obvious! Shmuel taught that if Reuven buys 10 fields...</p>
<p class="bas indent1"><span class="nm">(q)</span><span class="cl">Answer:</span> One might have thought that there, since they all serve the same purpose, and all land is connected, one Kinyan suffices, but here, they serve different purposes, so they are not acquired together. Rava teaches that this is not so.</p>
<p class="bas subject"><span class="nm">2)</span>ONE WHO SELLS AN OLIVEPRESS</p>
<p class="bas indent1"><span class="nm">(a)</span><span class="cl">(Mishnah):</span> If one sells an olivepress, this includes the Yam, Mamal and Besulos (these will be explained), but not the Avirim, wheel or beam;</p>
<p class="bas indent1"><span class="nm">(b)</span>If he said 'it and everything inside', all these are included.</p>
<p class="bas indent1"><span class="nm">(c)</span>R. Eliezer says, (even without saying this) the beam is included.</p>
<p class="bas indent1"><span class="nm">(d)</span><span class="cl">(Gemara):</span> 'Yam' is the tub;</p>
<p class="bas indent2"><span class="nm">1.</span><span class="cl">(R. Aba bar Mamal):</span> Mamal is the rock with a cavity in which the olives are pressed;</p>
<p class="bas indent2"><span class="nm">2.</span><span class="cl">(R. Yochanan):</span> Besulos are the poles that support the beam.</p>
<p class="bas indent1"><span class="nm">(e)</span>Avirim are planks placed on the olives when they are pressed;</p>
<p class="bas indent2"><span class="nm">1.</span>The wheel is used to lift and lower the beam;</p>
<p class="bas indent1"><span class="nm">(f)</span><span class="cl">(Beraisa):</span> If one sells an olivepress, this includes the planks, Yamim, Mamalim and bottoms of the millstones, but not the tops;</p>
<p class="bas indent2"><span class="nm">1.</span>If he said 'it and everything inside', all the tops are included.</p>
<p class="bas indent2"><span class="nm">2.</span>In any case, he did not sell the Avirim or sacks.</p>
<p class="bas indent1"><span class="nm">(g)</span>R. Eliezer says, the beam is included. The beam makes it an olivepress!</p>
<p class="bas subject"><span class="nm">3)</span>WHAT IS INCLUDED WITH A BATHHOUSE</p>
<p class="bas indent1"><span class="nm">(a)</span><span class="cl">(Mishnah):</span> If one sells a bathhouse, the planks, basins and curtains (or towels) are not included;</p>
<p class="bas indent1"><span class="nm">(b)</span>If he said 'it and everything inside', all these are included.</p>
<p class="bas indent1"><span class="nm">(c)</span>In any case, he did not sell springs that supply water, nor the storehouses of wood.</p>
<p class="bas indent1"><span class="nm">(d)</span><span class="cl">(Gemara - Beraisa):</span> If one sells a bathhouse, this includes the adjoining rooms where the planks, turbans, basins and curtains are stored;</p>
<p class="bas indent2"><span class="nm">1.</span>He did not sell the planks, turbans basins or curtains themselves.</p>
<p class="bas indent1"><span class="nm">(e)</span>If he said 'it and everything inside', all these are included.</p>
<p class="bas indent2"><span class="nm">1.</span>In any case, the springs that supply water are not sold, not in summer or winter (Rashbam; Tosfos ha'Rosh - springs that supply water in both summer or winter are excluded);</p>
<p class="bas indent2"><span class="nm">2.</span>If he said 'the bathhouse and everything that serves it', all are included.</p>
