<p class="bas subject"><span class="nm">1)</span>LAWS OF PESULEI HA'MUKDASHIN</p>
<p class="bas indent1"><span class="nm">(a)</span><span class="cl">(Seifa):</span> Its offspring may not be redeemed Tam. One may not be Matpis them for any Korban.</p>
<p class="bas indent1"><span class="nm">(b)</span><span class="cl">Inference #1:</span> Its offspring may be redeemed with a Mum;</p>
<p class="bas indent1"><span class="nm">(c)</span><span class="cl">Inference #2:</span> One may not be Matpis them for <i>any</i> Korban, but one may be Matpis them for the same Korban;</p>
<p class="bas indent2"><span class="nm">1.</span>One is Matpis them for the same Korban. They are redeemed with a Mum.</p>
<p class="bas indent1"><span class="nm">(d)</span><span class="cl">Question:</span> This refutes Rav Huna (15b, who said that we leave it to starve, for there is no other solution)!</p>
<p class="bas indent1"><span class="nm">(e)</span><span class="cl">Answer (Rav Huna):</span> No, its offspring may not be redeemed even with a Mum. (The inferences were wrong);</p>
<p class="bas indent2"><span class="nm">1.</span>The Seifa mentions Tam for parallel structure with the Reisha (which permits Pidyon even for a Tam).</p>
<p class="bas indent2"><span class="nm">2.</span>Since the Reisha permits Hatpasah (Hekdesh) to any Korban, the Seifa forbids Hatpasah to any Korban (even for the same Korban).</p>
<p class="bas indent1"><span class="nm">(f)</span><span class="cl">(Beraisa):</span> One who slaughters it outside is exempt. (Rashi explains that this is an explicit clause of the Seifa, i.e. a Tam that was Hukdash and later developed a Mum.)</p>
<p class="bas indent1"><span class="nm">(g)</span>Rav Huna's text in the Beraisa reads "he is liable." He establishes the case to be Dukin in the eye (a film over the eye, or a Mum in the eyelid);</p>
<p class="bas indent2"><span class="nm">1.</span>The Beraisa is like R. Akiva, who says that if a Korban with such a Mum was brought up the ramp, it is offered. (Therefore, it is considered fitting for the Mizbe'ach, so one is liable for Shechutei Chutz.)</p>
<p class="bas indent1"><span class="nm">(h)</span><span class="cl">(Mishnah):</span> Both before and after Pidyon it makes Temurah.</p>
<p class="bas indent1"><span class="nm">(i)</span><span class="cl">(Rav Nachman):</span> If Temurah was made after Pidyon, the Temurah must die.</p>
<p class="bas indent1"><span class="nm">(j)</span><span class="cl">Question:</span> What is the reason?</p>
<p class="bas indent1"><span class="nm">(k)</span><span class="cl">Answer:</span> There is no solution;</p>
<p class="bas indent2"><span class="nm">1.</span>It cannot be offered, for it comes from a Kedushah Dechuyah;</p>
<p class="bas indent2"><span class="nm">2.</span>It cannot be redeemed, for its Kedushah is too weak to be Matpis Pidyono.</p>
<p class="bas indent1"><span class="nm">(l)</span><span class="cl">Question (Rav Amram):</span> The owner should be allowed to eat it after it gets a Mum, just like Temurah of Bechor or of Ma'aser!</p>
<p class="bas indent2"><span class="nm">1.</span><span class="cl">(Mishnah):</span> Temuras Bechor or Ma'aser and all its descendants for all generations are like Bechor and Ma'aser. The owner eats it after it gets a Mum. (The Kohen is considered the "owner" of a Bechor.)</p>
<p class="bas indent1"><span class="nm">(m)</span><span class="cl">Answer (Abaye):</span> In both cases, descendants are attributed to their mother (or grandmother... ):</p>
<p class="bas indent2"><span class="nm">1.</span>Descendants of Temuras Bechor and Ma'aser are like Bechor and Ma'aser, the owner eats it after it gets a Mum;</p>
<p class="bas indent2"><span class="nm">2.</span>A descendant of Temuros of other Kodshim is like the original Kodshim. It may not be eaten until it is redeemed;</p>
<p class="bas indent3"><span class="nm">i.</span>A Temurah made after Pidyon cannot be redeemed.</p>
<p class="bas indent1"><span class="nm">(n)</span><span class="cl">Support (for Rav Nachman - Beraisa #1) Question:</span> What is the source that Temurah of Pesulei ha'Mukdashin must die?</p>
<p class="bas indent2"><span class="nm">1.</span><span class="cl">Answer:</span> "Mi'Ma'alei ha'Gera... Tamei (Hu Lachem)" (teaches that there are animals with Simanei Kashrus that are forbidden, i.e. Temuras Pesulei ha'Mukdashin).</p>
<p class="bas indent2"><span class="nm">2.</span><span class="cl">Question:</span> This is needed to forbid the five Chata'os that must die (because they cannot be offered, e.g. if the owner died, Temuras Chatas, etc.)!</p>
<p class="bas indent2"><span class="nm">3.</span><span class="cl">Answer #1:</span> We learn those from "umi'Mafrisei ha'Parsah... Tamei."</p>
<p class="bas indent2"><span class="nm">4.</span><span class="cl">Support (Beraisa #2):</span> Question: What is the source that the five Chata'os must die?</p>
<p class="bas indent3"><span class="nm">i.</span><span class="cl">Answer:</span> It says "umi'Mafrisei ha'Parsah... Tamei."</p>
<p class="bas indent2"><span class="nm">5.</span><span class="cl">Answer #2 (and Rebuttal of Answer #1 and Beraisa #2):</span> A tradition from Moshe from Sinai teaches that the five Chata'os must die!</p>
<p class="bas indent2"><span class="nm">6.</span><span class="cl">Correction:</span> Rather, "umi'Mafrisei ha'Parsah... " teaches about Temuras Asham. (It is Ro'eh until it becomes "Tamei," i.e. gets a Mum - Rashi. Alternatively, that it must die - Shitah Mekubetzes.)</p>
<p class="bas indent2"><span class="nm">7.</span><span class="cl">Question:</span> A tradition from Sinai teaches that whenever a Chatas must die (and this includes Temuras Chatas), the corresponding case of Asham is Ro'eh! (R. Tam - mid'Oraisa, it becomes an Olah. Mid'Rabanan, it is Ro'eh.)</p>
<p class="bas indent2"><span class="nm">8.</span><span class="cl">Defense #1 of Beraisa #2:</span> Really, "umi'Mafrisei... " teaches that the five Chata'os must die. Both the verse and the tradition are needed:</p>
<p class="bas indent3"><span class="nm">i.</span>If we only had the verse, we would have thought that it is Ro'eh (i.e. the verse forbids eating it without Pidyon). The tradition teaches that it must die;</p>
<p class="bas indent3"><span class="nm">ii.</span>If we had only the tradition, we would have thought that one who ate it transgressed, but there is no Lav. The verse teaches that he transgressed a Lav.</p>
<p class="bas indent2"><span class="nm">9.</span><span class="cl">Defense #2 of Beraisa #2:</span> "Umi'Mafrisei... " refers to the five Chata'os. It equates what is learned from "mi'Ma'alei ha'Gera" (Temuras Pesulei ha'Mukdashin) to Mafrisei ha'Parsah (the end of the verse, which alludes to the five Chata'os). Also it must die.</p>
<p class="bas subject"><span class="nm">2)</span>TZON BARZEL</p>
<p class="bas indent1"><span class="nm">(a)</span>(If Reuven gives animals to Shimon to be "Tzon Barzel," we assess their value. Shimon has a set time to pay, and until then Reuven gets half of the offspring. We will call the animals given "mothers.")</p>
<p class="bas indent1"><span class="nm">(b)</span><span class="cl">(Mishnah):</span> If Shimon received Tzon Barzel from a Nochri, the Vlados (offspring) of the mothers are exempt from Bechorah. Vladei Vladoseihen (grandchildren) are liable.</p>
<p class="bas bbbline">16b----------------------------------------16b</p>
<p class="bas indent1"><span class="nm">(c)</span><span class="cl">Version #1 (Rashi):</span> If Shimon gave the Nochri the right to collect from the Vlados in case the mothers will die, Vladei Vlados are exempt, and Vladei Vladei Vladoseihen are liable.</p>
<p class="bas indent1"><span class="nm">(d)</span><span class="cl">Version #2 (Tosfos):</span> If the mothers died and the children were designated to be in place of them, Vladei Vlados are exempt, and Vladei Vladei Vladoseihen are liable. (end of Version #2)</p>
<p class="bas indent1"><span class="nm">(e)</span>R. Shimon ben Gamliel says, even 10 generations are exempt, for the Nochri has Acharayus. (He may collect from them.)</p>
<p class="bas indent1"><span class="nm">(f)</span>If a sheep gave birth to a goat, or vice-versa, it is (a Nidmeh. It is) exempt from Bechorah;</p>
<p class="bas indent2"><span class="nm">1.</span>If the child resembles its mother in some ways, it has Kedushas Bechor;</p>
<p class="bas indent1"><span class="nm">(g)</span><span class="cl">(Gemara) Inference:</span> Because the owner did not receive money for the animals, it is as if they still belong to the original owner (the Nochri. Therefore, they are exempt.)</p>
<p class="bas indent1"><span class="nm">(h)</span><span class="cl">Contradiction (Mishnah):</span> Reuven may not receive Tzon Barzel from Shimon, for it is Ribis. (Shimon, the original owner, receives half of the offspring because he lent animals. Rashi - this is Ribis mid'Rabanan; Tosfos - it is mid'Oraisa.)</p>
<p class="bas indent2"><span class="nm">1.</span>(This would not be Ribis if the animals still belonged to Shimon. Rather,) this shows that the animals are considered to belong to the receiver!</p>
<p class="bas indent1"><span class="nm">(i)</span><span class="cl">Answer #1 (Abaye):</span> Here, the investor accepted (any losses due to) Ones or Zol (a drop in price), so they are considered his. In our Mishnah he did not, so they belong to the receiver.</p>
<p class="bas indent1"><span class="nm">(j)</span><span class="cl">Objection #1 (Rava):</span> If he accepted Ones or Zol, this is not called Tzon Barzel! (The name means that the investment is solid like iron. It is guaranteed not to decrease.)</p>
<p class="bas indent1"><span class="nm">(k)</span><span class="cl">Objection #2 (Rava):</span> Both Mishnayos simply say Tzon Barzel. We cannot say that each refers to a different agreement!</p>
<p class="bas indent1"><span class="nm">(l)</span><span class="cl">Objection #3 (Rava):</span> The Seifa of that Mishnah permits receiving Tzon Barzel from a Nochri;</p>
<p class="bas indent2"><span class="nm">1.</span>If it were true that when Shimon accepts Ones or Zol, they are considered his, so it is not Ribis, the Mishnah should make this distinction, to show that sometimes one may accept from a Yisrael, rather than distinguishing between Yisraelim and Nochrim!</p>
<p class="bas indent1"><span class="nm">(m)</span><span class="cl">Answer #2 (Rava):</span> In both Mishnayos, the investor did not accept Ones or Zol;</p>
<p class="bas indent2"><span class="nm">1.</span>(In our Mishnah), they are exempt from Bechorah because if the Nochri demands his money and the Yisrael does not give, the Nochri will take the animals. If he needs, he will take the children.</p>
<p class="bas indent2"><span class="nm">2.</span>Whenever a Nochri has rights to collect from animals, they are exempt from Bechorah.</p>
<p class="bas indent1"><span class="nm">(n)</span><span class="cl">(Mishnah):</span> If he designated Vlados in place of their mother, Vladei Vlados are exempt.</p>
<p class="bas indent1"><span class="nm">(o)</span><span class="cl">(Rav Huna):</span> (In the Reisha, without designation,) Vlados (of the mothers) are exempt from Bechorah (a firstborn male is not Kadosh, nor the firstborn of a female Vlad), but a firstborn of Vladei Vlados gets Kedushas Bechor.</p>
<p class="bas indent1"><span class="nm">(p)</span><span class="cl">(Rav Yehudah):</span> Vladei Vlados are exempt, but a firstborn of Vladei Vladei Vlados is Kodesh.</p>
<p class="bas indent1"><span class="nm">(q)</span><span class="cl">Question (against Rav Yehudah - Mishnah):</span> If he designated Vlados in place of their mother, Vladei Vlados are exempt.</p>
<p class="bas indent2"><span class="nm">1.</span><span class="cl">Inference:</span> Had he not designated them, Vladei Vlados would be liable!</p>
<p class="bas indent1"><span class="nm">(r)</span><span class="cl">Answer:</span> No, even had he not designated them, Vladei Vlados would be exempt;</p>
<p class="bas indent2"><span class="nm">1.</span>The Mishnah teaches that designation does not change anything. With or without designation, the Nochri normally collects from the grandchildren if he needs to. Therefore, Vladei Vlados are exempt, but Vladei Vladei Vlados are liable.</p>
