<p class="bas subject"><span class="nm">1)</span>EATING THINGS THAT ARE NOT PROPER TO EAT</p>
<p class="bas indent1"><span class="nm">(a)</span>According to Reish Lakish, we understand why R. Shimon exempts (one who swore 'I will not eat Neveilos... ') R. Shimon obligates lashes for eating Mashehu of Isur, therefore the oath does not take effect;</p>
<p class="bas indent2"><span class="nm">1.</span><span class="cl">(Beraisa - R. Shimon):</span> One is lashed for eating Mashehu of Isur. The Shi'ur of a k'Zayis pertains only to bringing a Korban.</p>
<p class="bas indent1"><span class="nm">(b)</span><span class="cl">Question:</span> According to R. Yochanan, why does R. Shimon exempt? (The oath should take effect, for it is Kolel permitted and forbidden food!)</p>
<p class="bas indent1"><span class="nm">(c)</span><span class="cl">Answer:</span> R. Shimon disagrees with the principle of Kolel.</p>
<p class="bas indent2"><span class="nm">1.</span><span class="cl">(Beraisa - R. Shimon):</span> One who eats a Neveilah on Yom Kipur is not liable for eating on Yom Kipur. (Ritzba - the animal died before Yom Kipur. The Isur to eat on Yom Kipur does not take effect on it, even though it forbids all Heter. If an animal dies on Yom Kipur, the Isur of Ever Min ha'Chai goes away, and the Isurim of Yom Kipur and Neveilah both take effect. Others say that even in this case, since it was forbidden to eat before Yom Kipur due to Ever Min ha'Chai (Rashi) or because it was not slaughtered (Tosfos), the Isur of Yom Kipur does not take effect.)</p>
<p class="bas indent1"><span class="nm">(d)</span>According to Reish Lakish, we understand why he brings a Korban for this oath. The oath could take effect in the positive ('I will eat less than a k'Zayis of Neveilos'; Reish Lakish holds that the Torah permits this) and the negative.</p>
<p class="bas indent1"><span class="nm">(e)</span><span class="cl">Question:</span> According to R. Yochanan, the oath takes effect in the negative (I will not eat Neveilos or slaughtered animals), but not in the positive (the oath of Sinai already forbids him to eat Neveilos)!</p>
<p class="bas indent1"><span class="nm">(f)</span><span class="cl">Version #1 - Answer:</span> The oath takes effect in the positive regarding a rotting Neveilah (it is unproper to eat, so the Torah permits it);</p>
<p class="bas indent2"><span class="nm">1.</span>We infer from Rava that when one specifies, eating unproper food is considered eating.</p>
<p class="bas indent2"><span class="nm">2.</span><span class="cl">Question (Rava):</span> If one swore 'I will not eat dirt', how much dirt must he eat to be liable?</p>
<p class="bas indent1"><span class="nm">(g)</span><span class="cl">Version #2 - Rashi - Answer #2 (to Question 3:c, 23b):</span> (In both clauses, he said 'I will not eat.') In the Reisha he is exempt, like Rava taught:</p>
<p class="bas indent2"><span class="nm">1.</span><span class="cl">(Rava):</span> If one swore 'I will not eat' and he ate dirt, he is exempt.</p>
<p class="bas indent2"><span class="nm">2.</span>In the Seifa he is liable, because Neveilos, Treifos... are considered proper to eat (just they are forbidden). (end of Version #2)</p>
<p class="bas indent1"><span class="nm">(h)</span><span class="cl">Support (Rav Mari - Mishnah):</span> If one swore 'Konam, I may not benefit from my wife if I ate today' and he ate Neveilos... she is forbidden.</p>
<p class="bas indent1"><span class="nm">(i)</span><span class="cl">Rejection:</span> That is no proof. There is different. Since he ate before swearing, when he swore he considered his act to be 'eating';</p>
<p class="bas bbbline">24b----------------------------------------24b</p>
<p class="bas indent2"><span class="nm">1.</span>Here, when he swears before eating, we have no source that he considers this eating!</p>
<p class="bas subject"><span class="nm">2)</span>ISUR KOLEL</p>
<p class="bas indent1"><span class="nm">(a)</span><span class="cl">(Rava):</span> (Normally, Ein Isur Chal Al Isur (a second Isur does not take effect on something already forbidden.) The opinion that Isur Chal Al Isur when it is Kolel (it also forbids things that were previously permitted) learns from an Isur Mosif (it forbids the forbidden object to more people or in more ways), which is Chal Al Isur;</p>
<p class="bas indent2"><span class="nm">1.</span>The opinion that Ein Isur Kolel Chal Al Isur, even though Isur Mosif is Chal, distinguishes. Since Mosif puts new Isurim on the forbidden object, it takes effect also regarding the old Isur;</p>
<p class="bas indent3"><span class="nm">i.</span>Regarding Kolel, the fact that new things become forbidden is no reason to put an additional Isur on what is already forbidden.</p>
<p class="bas indent1"><span class="nm">(b)</span><span class="cl">(Rava):</span> According to the opinion that Isur Kolel Chal Al Isur, if one swore 'I will not eat figs', and later swore 'I will not eat figs or grapes', since the latter oath takes effect for grapes, it also takes effect for figs.</p>
<p class="bas indent1"><span class="nm">(c)</span><span class="cl">Objection:</span> This is obvious!</p>
<p class="bas indent1"><span class="nm">(d)</span><span class="cl">Answer:</span> One might have thought that Isur Kolel Chal Al Isur only for Torah Isurim, but not for an Isur (such as an oath) that one made by himself. Rava teaches that this is not so.</p>
<p class="bas subject"><span class="nm">3)</span>MULTIPLE TRANSGRESSIONS FOR ONE EATING</p>
<p class="bas indent1"><span class="nm">(a)</span><span class="cl">Question (Rava brei d'Rabah - Mishnah):</span> One can be liable four Korbanos Chatas and an Asham for eating (slightly more than) a k'Zayis. The case is, a Tamei person ate Chelev that was Nosar from Kodshim, on Yom Kipur;</p>
<p class="bas indent2"><span class="nm">1.</span>R. Meir says, if it was also Shabbos and he took the food from a Reshus ha'Yachid and swallowed it in a Reshus ha'Rabim, he is also liable for transferring domains!</p>
<p class="bas indent2"><span class="nm">2.</span><span class="cl">Chachamim:</span> That liability is not for eating.</p>
<p class="bas indent2"><span class="nm">3.</span><span class="cl">Summation of question:</span> According to Rava, Chachamim can find a fifth Chatas. The case is, he had sworn 'I will not eat figs or Chelev.' Since the oath applies to figs, it applies also to Chelev!</p>
<p class="bas indent1"><span class="nm">(b)</span><span class="cl">Answer #1:</span> The Tana lists only Torah Isurim, but not what he forbade to himself.</p>
<p class="bas indent2"><span class="nm">1.</span><span class="cl">Question:</span> One Chatas is for eating Kodshim while Tamei. He made it Kodshim!</p>
<p class="bas indent2"><span class="nm">2.</span><span class="cl">Answer:</span> No, the case is, it was a Bechor (a male firstborn Tahor animal). The Torah made it Kodesh when it was born.</p>
<p class="bas indent1"><span class="nm">(c)</span><span class="cl">Answer #2:</span> The Tana only lists Isurim that cannot be annulled (but one can annul an oath).</p>
<p class="bas indent2"><span class="nm">1.</span><span class="cl">Question:</span> One can annul making an animal Kodesh!</p>
<p class="bas indent2"><span class="nm">2.</span><span class="cl">Answer:</span> We already established the case to be a Bechor.</p>
<p class="bas indent1"><span class="nm">(d)</span><span class="cl">Answer #3:</span> The Tana lists only liability that is Kavu'a (the same for rich and poor people). The Korban for transgressing Shevu'as Bituy is Oleh v'Yored.</p>
<p class="bas indent2"><span class="nm">1.</span><span class="cl">Question:</span> The Chatas for a Tamei person who ate Kodshim is an Oleh v'Yored!</p>
<p class="bas indent2"><span class="nm">2.</span><span class="cl">Answer:</span> The Mishnah discusses a Nasi. It is like R. Eliezer, who says that a Nasi brings a goat for Tum'ah of the Mikdash or Kodshim</p>
<p class="bas indent1"><span class="nm">(e)</span><span class="cl">Answer #4 (Rav Ashi):</span> The Tana lists only liability that depends on eating a certain quantity;</p>
<p class="bas indent2"><span class="nm">1.</span>One can be liable for an oath for eating Mashehu (if he specifies).</p>
<p class="bas indent2"><span class="nm">2.</span><span class="cl">Question:</span> One can be liable for eating Hekdesh, even less than a k'Zayis!</p>
<p class="bas indent2"><span class="nm">3.</span><span class="cl">Answer:</span> That also has a minimal quantity. It must be worth a Perutah.</p>
<p class="bas indent1"><span class="nm">(f)</span><span class="cl">Answer #5 (Rav Ashi of Avirya):</span> The Tana lists only liability for transgressions of Kares (had he sinned b'Mezid). Transgressing an oath is only a Lav.</p>
<p class="bas indent2"><span class="nm">1.</span><span class="cl">Question:</span> The Asham is for benefit from Kodshim, which is only a Lav!</p>
<p class="bas indent2"><span class="nm">2.</span><span class="cl">Answer:</span> The Tana lists liability for Chata'os only for transgressions of Kares.</p>
