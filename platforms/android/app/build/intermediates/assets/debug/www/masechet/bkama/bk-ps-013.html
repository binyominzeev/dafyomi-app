<p class="bas subject"><span class="nm">1)</span>WHICH <i>KODSHIM</i> <i>KALIM</i> ARE CONSIDERED PERSONAL MONEY?</p>
<p class="bas indent1"><span class="nm">(a)</span><span class="cl">(Beraisa - R. Yosi ha'Glili):</span> "He transgressed in Hash-m" includes Kodshei Kalim, which are a person's property;</p>
<p class="bas indent1"><span class="nm">(b)</span>Ben Azai says, this includes Shelamim;</p>
<p class="bas indent1"><span class="nm">(c)</span>Aba Yosi ben Dostai says, Ben Azai said 'only a Bechor (is a person's property).'</p>
<p class="bas indent1"><span class="nm">(d)</span><span class="cl">Version #1 - Question:</span> Ben Azai said 'this includes Shelamim' (i.e. but not all Kodshim Kalim). What did he come to exclude?</p>
<p class="bas indent2"><span class="nm">1.</span><span class="cl">Suggestion:</span> He excludes a Bechor.</p>
<p class="bas indent2"><span class="nm">2.</span><span class="cl">Rejection:</span> Shelamim requires Semichah (pressing on the animal's neck), accompanying flour and wine offerings, and waving the chest and foreleg, and still, we say that it is the owner's money. All the more so, a Bechor is the owner's property!</p>
<p class="bas indent1"><span class="nm">(e)</span><span class="cl">Answer (R. Yochanan):</span> He excludes Ma'aser of animals.</p>
<p class="bas indent2"><span class="nm">1.</span><span class="cl">(Beraisa):</span> It says about Bechor "Lo Sipadeh (it will not be redeemed)." It may be sold unblemished when alive, and if blemished, alive or slaughtered;</p>
<p class="bas indent2"><span class="nm">2.</span>It says about Ma'aser "Lo Yiga'el (it will not be redeemed)". (We learn from a Gezeirah Shavah from Cherem that) it may not be sold, alive or slaughtered, unblemished or blemished. (Therefore, it is not considered the owner's property.)</p>
<p class="bas indent1"><span class="nm">(f)</span><span class="cl">Version #2 (Ravina) Question:</span> Aba Yosi ben Dostai said that Ben Azai said 'only a Bechor.' What did he come to exclude?</p>
<p class="bas indent2"><span class="nm">1.</span><span class="cl">Suggestion:</span> He excludes a Shelamim.</p>
<p class="bas indent2"><span class="nm">2.</span><span class="cl">Rejection:</span> A Bechor is Kodesh from the moment it is born, and still, it is the owner's property. All the more so, a Shelamim is the owner's property!</p>
<p class="bas indent1"><span class="nm">(g)</span><span class="cl">Answer (R. Yochanan):</span> He excludes Ma'aser.</p>
<p class="bas indent2"><span class="nm">1.</span><span class="cl">(Beraisa):</span> It says about Bechor "Lo Sipadeh." It may be sold unblemished when alive, and if blemished, alive or slaughtered;</p>
<p class="bas indent2"><span class="nm">2.</span>It says about Ma'aser "Lo Yiga'el." It may not be sold, alive or slaughtered, unblemished or blemished.</p>
<p class="bas indent1"><span class="nm">(h)</span><span class="cl">Question:</span> Aba Yosi said that Ben Azai said only a Bechor (implying, nothing else)!</p>
<p class="bas indent2"><span class="nm">1.</span>This is left difficult.</p>
<p class="bas indent1"><span class="nm">(i)</span><span class="cl">(Rava):</span> The Mishnah says 'property in which there is no Me'ilah.' This refers to property to which the law of Me'ilah does not apply to, i.e. a person's property.</p>
<p class="bas indent1"><span class="nm">(j)</span><span class="cl">Question:</span> If so. the Mishnah should have said so explicitly!</p>
<p class="bas indent2"><span class="nm">1.</span>This is left difficult.</p>
<p class="bas subject"><span class="nm">2)</span><i>KODSHIM</i> THAT DAMAGEF</p>
<p class="bas indent1"><span class="nm">(a)</span><span class="cl">(R. Aba):</span> If a Shelamim damaged, we collect from the meat, not from the Eimurim (the parts of a Korban offered on the Mizbe'ach).</p>
<p class="bas indent1"><span class="nm">(b)</span><span class="cl">Question:</span> This is obvious! The Eimurim are to Hash-m!</p>
<p class="bas indent1"><span class="nm">(c)</span><span class="cl">Answer:</span> One might have thought that we collect from the meat the complete (half) damage, even though the Eimurim were partners in the damage. He teaches that this is not so.</p>
<p class="bas indent1"><span class="nm">(d)</span><span class="cl">Question:</span> According to which Tana is this?</p>
<p class="bas indent2"><span class="nm">1.</span><span class="cl">Suggestion:</span> It is like Chachamim.</p>
<p class="bas indent2"><span class="nm">2.</span><span class="cl">Rejection:</span> This is obvious! Chachamim say that when we cannot collect from one of two damagers, we do not collect extra from the other to compensate.</p>
<p class="bas indent2"><span class="nm">3.</span><span class="cl">Suggestion:</span> It is like R. Nasan.</p>
<p class="bas indent2"><span class="nm">4.</span>He says that when we cannot collect from one of two damagers, we collect extra from the other to compensate!</p>
<p class="bas indent1"><span class="nm">(e)</span><span class="cl">Answer:</span> This can be like either Tana'</p>
<p class="bas indent2"><span class="nm">1.</span>It can be like Chachamim. They said that one damager does not pay the other's share only when there are two damagers. When there is one damager, perhaps they admit that we collect from wherever we can!</p>
<p class="bas indent2"><span class="nm">2.</span>It can be like R. Nasan. He said his law only regarding a pit, for the victim can claim 'my ox is in your pit. What I cannot collect from the ox that pushed my ox, I will collect from you;'</p>
<p class="bas bbbline">13b----------------------------------------13b</p>
<p class="bas indent3"><span class="nm">i.</span>Here, one cannot say that the meat without the Eimurim caused all the damage!</p>
<p class="bas indent1"><span class="nm">(f)</span><span class="cl">(Rava):</span> If a Korban Todah damaged, we collect from the meat, not from the bread brought with it.</p>
<p class="bas indent1"><span class="nm">(g)</span><span class="cl">Question:</span> This is obvious!</p>
<p class="bas indent1"><span class="nm">(h)</span><span class="cl">Answer:</span> The Chidush is in the end of his teaching. The victim eats the meat, and the Miskaper (the one obligated to offer the Korban, i.e. the damager) brings the bread.</p>
<p class="bas indent1"><span class="nm">(i)</span><span class="cl">Question:</span> This is also obvious!</p>
<p class="bas indent1"><span class="nm">(j)</span><span class="cl">Answer:</span> One might have thought that since the Korban is invalid without the bread, the one who will eat the meat must bring the bread. He teaches that this is not so. The bread is the obligation of the owner of the Korban.</p>
<p class="bas subject"><span class="nm">3)</span>FOR WHICH PROPERTY MUST DAMAGES BE PAID?</p>
<p class="bas indent1"><span class="nm">(a)</span><span class="cl">(Mishnah):</span> Property of members of the covenant.</p>
<p class="bas indent1"><span class="nm">(b)</span><span class="cl">Question:</span> What does this come to exclude?</p>
<p class="bas indent2"><span class="nm">1.</span>It need not exclude Nochrim. A later Mishnah exempts the ox of a Yisrael that gores the ox of a Nochri!</p>
<p class="bas indent1"><span class="nm">(c)</span><span class="cl">Answer:</span> That Mishnah explains our Mishnah.</p>
<p class="bas indent1"><span class="nm">(d)</span><span class="cl">(Mishnah):</span> Specific property.</p>
<p class="bas indent1"><span class="nm">(e)</span><span class="cl">Question:</span> What does this come to exclude?</p>
<p class="bas indent1"><span class="nm">(f)</span><span class="cl">Answer #1 (Rav Yehudah):</span> It excludes when we do not know which animal damaged.</p>
<p class="bas indent2"><span class="nm">1.</span><span class="cl">Question:</span> A later Mishnah teaches that two oxen of two men were chasing an animal, and we do not know which damaged it, they are exempt.</p>
<p class="bas indent2"><span class="nm">2.</span><span class="cl">Answer:</span> That Mishnah explains our Mishnah.</p>
<p class="bas indent1"><span class="nm">(g)</span><span class="cl">Answer #2 (Beraisa):</span> It excludes Hefker property.</p>
<p class="bas indent2"><span class="nm">1.</span><span class="cl">Question:</span> What is the case?</p>
<p class="bas indent3"><span class="nm">i.</span>If a man's ox gored a Hefker ox, surely he is exempt. No one can ask him to pay!</p>
<p class="bas indent2"><span class="nm">2.</span><span class="cl">Answer:</span> Rather, a Hefker ox gored a man's ox.</p>
<p class="bas indent2"><span class="nm">3.</span><span class="cl">Question:</span> He can take the ox that damaged!</p>
<p class="bas indent2"><span class="nm">4.</span><span class="cl">Answer:</span> The case is, someone else took it before the victim.</p>
<p class="bas indent1"><span class="nm">(h)</span><span class="cl">Answer #3 (Ravina):</span> If Reuven's ox damaged, and Reuven made it Hekdesh or Hefker, he is exempt.</p>
<p class="bas indent1"><span class="nm">(i)</span><span class="cl">Support (Beraisa - R. Yehudah):</span> Even if the owner made his animal Hekdesh or Hefker after it damaged, he is exempt.</p>
<p class="bas indent2"><span class="nm">1.</span>We learn from "the owner was warned, and it killed" - the killing and bringing to trial must like one (the animal had one owner the entire time).</p>
<p class="bas indent2"><span class="nm">2.</span><span class="cl">Question:</span> Is this enough? We should also require the final verdict in the same status - "the ox will be stoned" is the final verdict!</p>
<p class="bas indent2"><span class="nm">3.</span><span class="cl">Correction:</span> Indeed, the killing, bringing to trial and final verdict must like one.</p>
<p class="bas subject"><span class="nm">4)</span>WHERE IS ONE LIABLE FOR DAMAGE?</p>
<p class="bas indent1"><span class="nm">(a)</span><span class="cl">(Mishnah):</span> Except in the premises of the damager.</p>
<p class="bas indent1"><span class="nm">(b)</span>This is because he can say 'your ox had no right to be on my property.'</p>
<p class="bas indent1"><span class="nm">(c)</span><span class="cl">(Mishnah):</span> ...And the joint property of the damager and victim.</p>
<p class="bas indent1"><span class="nm">(d)</span><span class="cl">(Rav Chisda):</span> One is liable for Shen and Regel in the joint property of the damager and victim;</p>
<p class="bas indent2"><span class="nm">1.</span>The Mishnah means 'except in the premises of the damager (where he is exempt). In the joint property of the damager and victim, when he damages, he must pay.'</p>
<p class="bas indent1"><span class="nm">(e)</span><span class="cl">(R. Elazar):</span> One is exempt for Shen and Regel in the joint property of the damager and victim;</p>
<p class="bas indent2"><span class="nm">1.</span>The Mishnah means 'except in the premises of the damager, or in the joint property of the damager and victim (where he is exempt). 'And when he damages, he must pay' comes to include Keren.</p>
<p class="bas indent1"><span class="nm">(f)</span>This is like Shmuel (who says that Keren was not yet mentioned in the Mishnah. 'Ox' refers to Regel);</p>
<p class="bas indent1"><span class="nm">(g)</span><span class="cl">Question:</span> Rav says that 'ox' includes all damages of an ox. What does 'when he damages, he must pay' come to include?</p>
<p class="bas indent1"><span class="nm">(h)</span><span class="cl">Answer (Beraisa):</span> 'When he damages, he must pay' comes to include a Shomer Chinam, a borrower, a Shomer Sachar, and a renter, when an animal in their Reshus damaged (this will be explained);</p>
<p class="bas indent2"><span class="nm">1.</span>A Tam pays half-damage, a Mu'ad pays full damage.</p>
<p class="bas indent2"><span class="nm">2.</span>If the wall broke down at night, or robbers made an opening and the animal went out and damaged, the Shomer is exempt.</p>
<p class="bas indent1"><span class="nm">(i)</span><span class="cl">Question:</span> What case does this discuss?</p>
<p class="bas indent2"><span class="nm">1.</span><span class="cl">Suggestion:</span> The lender's animal damaged the borrower's animal (and the lender must pay). 2.  Rejection: Had it damaged someone else's animal, the borrower would have needed to pay (for not guarding it properly). Should the lender pay for damage to the borrower's animal?!</p>
<p class="bas indent1"><span class="nm">(j)</span><span class="cl">Answer #1:</span> Rather, the borrower's animal damaged the lender's animal.</p>
<p class="bas indent1"><span class="nm">(k)</span><span class="cl">Objection:</span> Had another's animal damaged the lender's animal, the borrower would have had to pay full damage. If the borrower's (Tam) animal did the damage, should he pay only half-damage?!</p>
<p class="bas indent1"><span class="nm">(l)</span><span class="cl">Answer #2:</span> Really the lender's animal damaged the borrower's animal. The case is, the borrower accepted only to guard the lender's animal from being damaged, but not from damaging.</p>
