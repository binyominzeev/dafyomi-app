<p class="bas indent1"><span class="nm">(a)</span><span class="cl">(Mishnah):</span> The following are Pesulim:</p>
<p class="bas indent2"><span class="nm">1.</span>One whose ankles or knees knock when he walks;</p>
<p class="bas indent2"><span class="nm">2.</span>Ikal, i.e. one whose knees do not touch when he sits with his feet together;</p>
<p class="bas indent2"><span class="nm">3.</span>Ba'al Pikah (Rashi - flesh like a ball protrudes from his thumb or big toe; Rambam - the next Mum (a big heel) is Ba'al Pikah);</p>
<p class="bas indent2"><span class="nm">4.</span>His heel sticks out in back (of where his foot connects to his leg);</p>
<p class="bas indent2"><span class="nm">5.</span>His feet are wide like a goose's;</p>
<p class="bas indent2"><span class="nm">6.</span>His fingers or toes overlap each other.</p>
<p class="bas indent1"><span class="nm">(b)</span>If his fingers or toes are connected until the (middle) joint, he is Kosher;</p>
<p class="bas indent2"><span class="nm">1.</span>If they were connected past the joint, and they were cut apart, he is Kosher.</p>
<p class="bas indent1"><span class="nm">(c)</span>If he had an extra finger or toe and it was cut off, if it had a bone, he is Pasul. If not, he is Kosher.</p>
<p class="bas indent1"><span class="nm">(d)</span>R. Yehudah says, if he has six fingers on every hand and foot, 24 in all, he is Kosher;</p>
<p class="bas indent1"><span class="nm">(e)</span>Chachamim are Posel.</p>
<p class="bas indent1"><span class="nm">(f)</span>Rebbi is Posel one who is ambidextrous;</p>
<p class="bas indent1"><span class="nm">(g)</span>Chachamim are Machshir.</p>
<p class="bas indent1"><span class="nm">(h)</span><span class="cl">(Gemara - Beraisa) Question:</span> "Shever Ragel" only teaches about a broken leg. What is the source to Posel one who is knock-kneed, Ikal, and Ba'al Pikah?</p>
<p class="bas indent1"><span class="nm">(i)</span><span class="cl">Answer:</span> "Oh Shever Ragel" includes these.</p>
<p class="bas indent1"><span class="nm">(j)</span><span class="cl">(Beraisa):</span> Ba'al Pikah and Shufnar are Pesulim.</p>
<p class="bas indent1"><span class="nm">(k)</span><span class="cl">(R. Yochanan):</span> Ba'al Pikah is one whose ankle is big. Shufnar does not have ankles (that stick out) at all.</p>
<p class="bas indent1"><span class="nm">(l)</span><span class="cl">(Mishnah):</span> Flesh like a ball protrudes from his thumb or big toe. His heel sticks out in back.</p>
<p class="bas indent1"><span class="nm">(m)</span><span class="cl">(R. Elazar):</span> (In the latter,) his leg connects to the middle of his foot.</p>
<p class="bas indent1"><span class="nm">(n)</span><span class="cl">(Mishnah):</span> His feet are wide like a goose's.</p>
<p class="bas indent1"><span class="nm">(o)</span><span class="cl">(Rav Papa):</span> We do not require that they are thin <i>and</i> the toes are stuck together. Rather, if they are thin, even if the toes are apart, it is a Mum.</p>
<p class="bas indent1"><span class="nm">(p)</span><span class="cl">(Mishnah):</span> His fingers or toes overlap each other; or, if his fingers or toes are connected...</p>
<p class="bas indent1"><span class="nm">(q)</span><span class="cl">(Beraisa) Question:</span> "Shever Yad" teaches only about a broken hand;</p>
<p class="bas indent2"><span class="nm">1.</span>What is the source to Posel one whose fingers overlap each other; or, if his fingers are connected past the joint, and they were cut apart...</p>
<p class="bas indent2"><span class="nm">2.</span><span class="cl">Interjection:</span> The Mishnah is Machshir if they were cut apart!</p>
<p class="bas indent2"><span class="nm">3.</span><span class="cl">Correction:</span> What is the source to Posel... if they were not cut apart?</p>
<p class="bas indent2"><span class="nm">4.</span><span class="cl">Answer:</span> "Oh Shever Yad" includes these.</p>
<p class="bas subject"><span class="nm">2)</span>AN EXTRA FINGER</p>
<p class="bas indent1"><span class="nm">(a)</span><span class="cl">(Mishnah):</span> If he had an extra finger or toe and it was cut off, if it had a bone, he is Pasul. If not, he is Kosher.</p>
<p class="bas indent1"><span class="nm">(b)</span><span class="cl">(R. Yochanan):</span> This is only if it is counted on the hand (i.e. it is in line with the other fingers. If not, he is Kosher in any case.)</p>
<p class="bas indent1"><span class="nm">(c)</span>(Even a small bone of a Mes has Tum'as Maga (touching) and Masa (moving); Tum'as Ohel applies only to a complete Ever (with flesh and sinews), or a Rova Kav (Log) of bones, or bones that comprise the majority of the height, or are the majority of bones of the body (i.e. at least 125).)</p>
<p class="bas indent1"><span class="nm">(d)</span><span class="cl">(Beraisa):</span> If an extra finger has a bone but not a nail, it has Tum'as Maga, Masa and Ohel, and it counts towards 125 bones.</p>
<p class="bas indent1"><span class="nm">(e)</span><span class="cl">(R. Yochanan):</span> This is only if it is counted on the hand.</p>
<p class="bas indent1"><span class="nm">(f)</span><span class="cl">(Rav Chisda citing Rav):</span> If an extra finger has a bone but not a nail, it has Tum'as Maga and Masa, but not Ohel.</p>
<p class="bas indent1"><span class="nm">(g)</span><span class="cl">(R. Yochanan):</span> This is only if it is not counted on the hand.</p>
<p class="bas indent1"><span class="nm">(h)</span><span class="cl">R. Yochanan:</span> This is difficult. Chachamim did not explain it!</p>
<p class="bas indent2"><span class="nm">1.</span>If it is an Ever, it should be Metamei also b'Ohel;</p>
<p class="bas indent2"><span class="nm">2.</span>If it is not an Ever, it should not have Tum'as Masa or Maga!</p>
<p class="bas indent1"><span class="nm">(i)</span><span class="cl">Answer #1 (Rav Huna bar Mano'ach):</span> (It is not an Ever.) It is like a bone no smaller than a barley seed. It has Tum'as Maga and Masa, but not Ohel.</p>
<p class="bas indent1"><span class="nm">(j)</span><span class="cl">Answer #2 (Rav Papa):</span> (Mid'Oraisa, it is not an Ever, and it does not have Tum'as Mes.) Chachamim decreed that it has Tum'as Maga and Masa, lest people think that even if it is counted on the hand it is not Tamei.</p>
<p class="bas indent1"><span class="nm">(k)</span><span class="cl">Question:</span> For the same reason, they should have decreed Tum'as Ohel!</p>
<p class="bas indent1"><span class="nm">(l)</span><span class="cl">Answer:</span> They made it unlike Tum'ah mid'Oraisa in this respect, in order that people will know that its Tum'ah is only mid'Rabanan, lest they burn Terumah or Kodshim due to it.</p>
<p class="bas subject"><span class="nm">3)</span>THE NUMBER OF LIMBS</p>
<p class="bas indent1"><span class="nm">(a)</span><span class="cl">(Mishnah):</span> Bones that comprise the majority of the height (without the head; this will be explained), or are the majority of bones of the body have Tum'as Ohel.</p>
<p class="bas indent1"><span class="nm">(b)</span><span class="cl">(Beraisa) Question:</span> What is the majority of the height?</p>
<p class="bas indent1"><span class="nm">(c)</span><span class="cl">Answer:</span> It is both shins and one thigh;</p>
<p class="bas indent2"><span class="nm">1.</span>The majority of bones is 125.</p>
<p class="bas indent1"><span class="nm">(d)</span><span class="cl">Question (Ravina):</span> Does the Tana merely teach that 125 is the majority (of the 248 limbs)?!</p>
<p class="bas indent1"><span class="nm">(e)</span><span class="cl">Answer (Rava):</span> He teaches like the following Beraisa;</p>
<p class="bas indent2"><span class="nm">1.</span><span class="cl">(Beraisa):</span> Even if the person was missing limbs and had only 200.(e.g. he lacked eight fingers and toes, each of which has six bones) or had extra, e.g. a total of 281, even the extra limbs count towards 125;</p>
<p class="bas indent2"><span class="nm">2.</span>We consider 125 to be the majority, like it is for most people.</p>
<p class="bas indent1"><span class="nm">(f)</span><span class="cl">(Rav Yehudah):</span> A case occurred in which the king sentenced a harlot to be burned. She was cooked in water. R. Yishmael's Talmidim counted the bones.</p>
<p class="bas indent2"><span class="nm">1.</span><span class="cl">His Talmidim:</span> We found 252 bones in a Mes!</p>
<p class="bas indent2"><span class="nm">2.</span><span class="cl">R. Yishmael:</span> Perhaps it was a female. Verses teach that she has four extra limbs, i.e. two hinges and two doors.</p>
<p class="bas indent2"><span class="nm">3.</span><span class="cl">(Beraisa - R. Eliezer):</span> A woman has hinges, just like a house - "... Ki Nehefchu Aleha Tzireha."</p>
<p class="bas indent2"><span class="nm">4.</span>R. Yehoshua says a woman has doors, just like a house - "Ki Lo Sagar Dalsei Vitni."</p>
<p class="bas indent2"><span class="nm">5.</span>R. Akiva says a woman has a key, just like a house - "va'Yiftach Es Rachmah."</p>
<p class="bas indent1"><span class="nm">(g)</span><span class="cl">Question:</span> According to R. Akiva, they should have found 253!</p>
<p class="bas indent1"><span class="nm">(h)</span><span class="cl">Answer:</span> The key is very small. Perhaps it dissolved in cooking.</p>
<p class="bas indent1"><span class="nm">(i)</span><span class="cl">(Rava):</span> The extra limbs of a woman are not Metamei b'Ohel. "Adam Ki Yamus b'Ohel" teaches that Tum'as Ohel applies only to limbs found in all people (but not those special to females).</p>
<p class="bas indent1"><span class="nm">(j)</span><span class="cl">Question (Abaye):</span> Verses teach that men also have hinges. Yeshayahu said "Tzirim Achazuni k'Tzirei Yoledah"!</p>
<p class="bas indent1"><span class="nm">(k)</span><span class="cl">Answer (Rava):</span> A man's hinges are of flesh, not of bone.</p>
<p class="bas indent1"><span class="nm">(l)</span><span class="cl">Question:</span> Daniel said that "Adoni ba'Mar'a Nehefchu Tzirai Alai"!</p>
<p class="bas indent1"><span class="nm">(m)</span><span class="cl">Answer:</span> A man's hinges are of flesh, not bone.</p>
<p class="bas indent1"><span class="nm">(n)</span><span class="cl">Support:</span> We must say so. If not, neither men nor women would have (exactly) 248 limbs!</p>
<p class="bas bbbline">45b----------------------------------------45b</p>
<p class="bas indent1"><span class="nm">(o)</span><span class="cl">(Mishnah):</span> If he has six fingers on every hand and foot... (R. Yehudah is Machshir, and Chachamim are Posel.)</p>
<p class="bas indent1"><span class="nm">(p)</span><span class="cl">(R. Yitzchak):</span> Both of them expound the same verse. Regarding Galyus it says "v'Etzbe'os Yadav v'Etzbe'os Raglav Shesh va'Shesh";</p>
<p class="bas indent2"><span class="nm">1.</span>Chachamim hold that the verse disgraces him (he was a Ba'al Mum);</p>
<p class="bas indent2"><span class="nm">2.</span>R. Yehudah holds that the verse magnifies his might.</p>
<p class="bas indent1"><span class="nm">(q)</span><span class="cl">Question (Rabah):</span> Why does it say "Shesh va'Shesh Esrim v'Arba Mispar"?</p>
<p class="bas indent1"><span class="nm">(r)</span><span class="cl">Answer:</span> Had it said only Shesh va'Shesh, we would have thought that he had a total of six fingers and a total of six toes. Therefore, it says Esrim v'Arba (24);</p>
<p class="bas indent2"><span class="nm">1.</span>Had it said only Esrim v'Arba, we would not know that each hand had the same number of fingers;</p>
<p class="bas indent2"><span class="nm">2.</span>"Mispar" teaches that they were counted with the hand.</p>
<p class="bas indent1"><span class="nm">(s)</span><span class="cl">(Beraisa - R. Yehudah):</span> A case occurred in which a man came in front of R. Tarfon. He had six digits on every hand and foot. R. Tarfon said "there should be more like you in Yisrael!"</p>
<p class="bas indent1"><span class="nm">(t)</span><span class="cl">R. Yosi:</span> (This was not a praise. He meant that the Mamzerim and Nesinim in Yisrael should stand out like you (lest people marry them)!</p>
<p class="bas subject"><span class="nm">4)</span><i>PESULIM</i> THAT APPLY ONLY TO PEOPLE</p>
<p class="bas indent1"><span class="nm">(a)</span><span class="cl">(Mishnah):</span> One who is ambidextrous...</p>
<p class="bas indent1"><span class="nm">(b)</span><span class="cl">(Beraisa):</span> If a Kohen is left handed or favors his left foot (begins walking with it), he is Pasul;</p>
<p class="bas indent2"><span class="nm">1.</span>Rebbi is Posel an ambidextrous Kohen;</p>
<p class="bas indent2"><span class="nm">2.</span>Chachamim are Machshir.</p>
<p class="bas indent1"><span class="nm">(c)</span>Rebbi holds that his right hand is weaker than it should be. Chachamim hold that his right hand is fine, and his left hand is extra strong.</p>
<p class="bas indent1"><span class="nm">(d)</span><span class="cl">(Mishnah):</span> The following are Pesulim in a person, but not in an animal:</p>
<p class="bas indent2"><span class="nm">1.</span>A Kushi, Gichor, or Lavkan (these will be explained);</p>
<p class="bas indent2"><span class="nm">2.</span>One who is a Kipe'ach, midget, deaf, crazy, drunk, or has Nega'im (resembling Tzara'as) that are Tehorim.</p>
<p class="bas indent1"><span class="nm">(e)</span>R. Shimon ben Gamliel says, a crazy animal is not a choice Korban.</p>
<p class="bas indent1"><span class="nm">(f)</span>R. Elazar says, also dangling flesh is Posel a person, but not an animal.</p>
<p class="bas indent1"><span class="nm">(g)</span><span class="cl">(Gemara):</span> A Kushi is black. A Gichor is (very) white (Albino). A Lavkan is red.</p>
<p class="bas indent1"><span class="nm">(h)</span><span class="cl">Objection:</span> A man was saying "who wants Luvkiani," and he was found to be selling white (sheep)!</p>
<p class="bas indent1"><span class="nm">(i)</span><span class="cl">Correction:</span> Rather, a Kushi is black, a Gichor is red, and a Lavkan is white.</p>
<p class="bas indent1"><span class="nm">(j)</span><span class="cl">(Mishnah):</span> A Kipe'ach.</p>
<p class="bas indent1"><span class="nm">(k)</span><span class="cl">(Rav Zevid - Beraisa):</span> This is a (very) tall person.</p>
<p class="bas indent1"><span class="nm">(l)</span><span class="cl">Objection:</span> R. Avahu taught that Hash-m praises tall people - "v'Anochi Hishmadeti Es ha'Emori Mipneihem Asher k'Govah Arazim Gavho"!</p>
<p class="bas indent1"><span class="nm">(m)</span><span class="cl">Answer (Rav Papa):</span> One who is too thin for his height is scorned. (He does not stand straight, for he cannot support his weight.)</p>
<p class="bas indent1"><span class="nm">(n)</span><span class="cl">(Reish Lakish):</span> A (very) tall person should not marry another tall person, lest the children will be giants;</p>
<p class="bas indent2"><span class="nm">1.</span>A midget should not marry another midget, lest the children be even smaller;</p>
<p class="bas indent2"><span class="nm">2.</span>An Albino should not marry another Albino, lest the children be too white;</p>
<p class="bas indent2"><span class="nm">3.</span>A black person should not marry another black person, lest the children be very black.</p>
<p class="bas indent1"><span class="nm">(o)</span><span class="cl">(Mishnah):</span> One who is deaf, crazy, or drunk.</p>
<p class="bas indent1"><span class="nm">(p)</span><span class="cl">Question:</span> One who is drunk is Mechalel Avodah (what he offered is Pasul). He should be listed among Pesulim that are Mechalel Avodah!</p>
<p class="bas indent1"><span class="nm">(q)</span><span class="cl">Answer:</span> The Mishnah discusses someone drunk from things other than wine. It is unlike R. Yehudah:</p>
<p class="bas indent2"><span class="nm">1.</span><span class="cl">(Beraisa):</span> If one ate a date of Ke'ilah, drank much milk, or ate much honey (cooked with water) and (became drunk and) entered the Mikdash, he is liable. (We know that this Beraisa is like R. Yehudah.)</p>
<p class="bas subject"><span class="nm">5)</span>THINGS THAT DISQUALIFY ONLY ANIMALS</p>
<p class="bas indent1"><span class="nm">(a)</span><span class="cl">(Mishnah):</span> The following are Pesulim in an animal, but not in a person:</p>
<p class="bas indent2"><span class="nm">1.</span>Oso v'Es Beno, Terefah, and Yotzei Dofen.</p>
<p class="bas indent1"><span class="nm">(b)</span>If a Kohen married a woman forbidden to him, he is Pasul until he vows not to benefit from her (Rashi - nor she from him);</p>
<p class="bas indent1"><span class="nm">(c)</span>If a Kohen becomes Tamei Mes, he is Pasul until he accedes not to do so again.</p>
<p class="bas indent1"><span class="nm">(d)</span><span class="cl">(Gemara) Question:</span> Oso v'Es Beno is not Pasul in a person. What is the case?</p>
<p class="bas indent1"><span class="nm">(e)</span><span class="cl">Answer #1:</span> Aharon (or any other Kohen) and his children may serve together.</p>
<p class="bas indent1"><span class="nm">(f)</span><span class="cl">Objection:</span> The corresponding case of animals is permitted!</p>
<p class="bas indent2"><span class="nm">1.</span><span class="cl">(Beraisa):</span> Oso v'Es Beno applies to a mother (and her child), but not to a father.</p>
<p class="bas indent1"><span class="nm">(g)</span><span class="cl">Answer #2:</span> We may not offer a mother and her child on the same day, the corresponding case of Kohanim (a Kohenes and her son) may serve together.</p>
<p class="bas indent1"><span class="nm">(h)</span><span class="cl">Rejection:</span> A Kohenes may not do Avodah!</p>
<p class="bas indent1"><span class="nm">(i)</span><span class="cl">Defense of Answer #1:</span> Really, the Mishnah permits a Kohen and his son;</p>
<p class="bas indent2"><span class="nm">1.</span><span class="cl">(R. Yosi bar Avin):</span> Our Mishnah is like Chananya.</p>
<p class="bas indent2"><span class="nm">2.</span><span class="cl">(Beraisa):</span> Oso v'Es Beno applies to a mother, not to a father;</p>
<p class="bas indent2"><span class="nm">3.</span>Chananya says, it applies to mothers and fathers.</p>
