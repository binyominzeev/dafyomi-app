<p class="bas subject"><span class="nm">1)</span>HOW SHMUEL EXPLAINS THE MISHNAH</p>
<p class="bas indent1"><span class="nm">(a)</span><span class="cl">(Rav Yehudah):</span> Shmuel explains the Mishnah to say 'Re'i (the leniency) of an ox (Keren), in which the damager gets no Hana'ah, is unlike that of Mav'eh (Shen), in which the damager gets Hana'ah;</p>
<p class="bas indent2"><span class="nm">1.</span>The Re'i of Shen, which has no intent to damage, is unlike that of Keren, which has intent to damage. (Tosfos - he considers lack of Hana'ah or no intent to damage to be leniencies, for it is easier to guard one's animal from damage in these cases. The next question disagrees with Rav Yehudah.)</p>
<p class="bas indent1"><span class="nm">(b)</span><span class="cl">Question:</span> We should be able to learn one from the other from a Kal va'Chomer!</p>
<p class="bas indent2"><span class="nm">1.</span>One is liable for Shen, which has no intent to damage. All the more so, one should be liable for Keren, which has intent to damage!</p>
<p class="bas indent1"><span class="nm">(c)</span><span class="cl">Answer:</span> We cannot learn from a Kal va'Chomer. One might have thought that just like (the master of) a slave is exempt, even though the slave intended to damage, also Keren.</p>
<p class="bas indent1"><span class="nm">(d)</span><span class="cl">Objection (Rav Ashi):</span> We would not think so. The only reason one is exempt for his slaves is lest a slave get angry at his master, and decide to cause tremendous damage to trouble him. This reason does not apply to animals!</p>
<p class="bas indent1"><span class="nm">(e)</span><span class="cl">Correction:</span> Rather, Re'i, i.e. the stringency of Keren, which has intent to damage, is unlike that of Shen, which has no intent to damage;</p>
<p class="bas indent2"><span class="nm">1.</span>The stringency of Shen, in which there is Hana'ah to the damager, is unlike that of Keren, which has no Hana'ah to the damager.</p>
<p class="bas indent1"><span class="nm">(f)</span><span class="cl">Question:</span> Did the Tana teach Keren and Shen, and omit Regel?!</p>
<p class="bas indent1"><span class="nm">(g)</span><span class="cl">Answer:</span> The Reisha, 'if they damaged, the damager must pay from Meitav land' includes Regel.</p>
<p class="bas indent1"><span class="nm">(h)</span><span class="cl">Objection:</span> Regel should have been taught explicitly!</p>
<p class="bas indent1"><span class="nm">(i)</span><span class="cl">Answer #2 (to question 4:l, Daf 3b - Rava):</span> 'Ox' teaches Regel, and Mav'eh teaches Shen.</p>
<p class="bas indent2"><span class="nm">1.</span>The stringency of Regel, which is common, is unlike that of Shen, which is not common;</p>
<p class="bas indent3"><span class="nm">i.</span>The stringency of Shen, in which there is Hana'ah to the damager, is unlike that of Regel, which has no Hana'ah to the damager.</p>
<p class="bas indent1"><span class="nm">(j)</span><span class="cl">Question:</span> Did the Tana teach Regel and Shen, and omit Keren?!</p>
<p class="bas indent1"><span class="nm">(k)</span><span class="cl">Answer:</span> The Reisha, 'if they damaged, the damager must pay from Meitav' includes Keren.</p>
<p class="bas indent1"><span class="nm">(l)</span><span class="cl">Objection:</span> Keren should have been taught explicitly!</p>
<p class="bas indent1"><span class="nm">(m)</span><span class="cl">Answer:</span> The Tana only lists explicitly things that are Mu'ad (pay full damage) from the beginning.</p>
<p class="bas indent1"><span class="nm">(n)</span><span class="cl">Question:</span> Why didn't Shmuel learn like Rav?</p>
<p class="bas indent1"><span class="nm">(o)</span><span class="cl">Answer:</span> A later Mishnah (15b) teaches 'a Mu'ad ox, an ox that damages on the premises of the victim (the one whose property was harmed), and man.' This implies that our Mishnah does not discuss man.</p>
<p class="bas indent1"><span class="nm">(p)</span><span class="cl">Question:</span> Why doesn't our Mishnah discuss man?</p>
<p class="bas indent1"><span class="nm">(q)</span><span class="cl">Answer:</span> Our Mishnah discusses only damages of a man's property, not of man himself.</p>
<p class="bas indent1"><span class="nm">(r)</span><span class="cl">Question:</span> How does Rav explain why the later Mishnah also mentions man?</p>
<p class="bas indent1"><span class="nm">(s)</span><span class="cl">Answer:</span> That Mishnah lists all Mu'ad damagers.</p>
<p class="bas subject"><span class="nm">2)</span>HOW RAV EXPLAINS THE MISHNAH</p>
<p class="bas indent1"><span class="nm">(a)</span><span class="cl">Question:</span> How does Rav explain our Mishnah (how it explains why an ox and Mav'eh needed to be written in the Torah)?</p>
<p class="bas indent1"><span class="nm">(b)</span><span class="cl">Answer:</span> The stringency of an ox, which (i.e. its owner) pays Kofer (ransom when it kills someone), is unlike that of man, who does not pay Kofer;</p>
<p class="bas indent2"><span class="nm">1.</span>The leniency of man, who pays four additional damages (pain, medical expenses, Sheves (compensation for total inability to work while sick due to the injury), and embarrassment) is unlike that of an ox, which is exempt from these.</p>
<p class="bas indent1"><span class="nm">(c)</span><span class="cl">Question:</span> The Reisha says 'the Tzad ha'Shavah of (what is common to) all the damagers is that it is their nature is to damage.' Is this really true about an ox?!</p>
<p class="bas indent1"><span class="nm">(d)</span><span class="cl">Answer:</span> This refers to a Mu'ad.</p>
<p class="bas indent1"><span class="nm">(e)</span><span class="cl">Question:</span> Is it really the nature of a Mu'ad to damage?</p>
<p class="bas indent1"><span class="nm">(f)</span><span class="cl">Answer:</span> Yes!</p>
<p class="bas indent1"><span class="nm">(g)</span><span class="cl">Question:</span> Is it really the nature of a man to damage?</p>
<p class="bas indent1"><span class="nm">(h)</span><span class="cl">Answer:</span> This refers to a sleeping man.</p>
<p class="bas indent1"><span class="nm">(i)</span><span class="cl">Question:</span> Is it really the nature of a sleeping man to damage?</p>
<p class="bas indent1"><span class="nm">(j)</span><span class="cl">Answer:</span> Yes, because he retracts and stretches out his limbs.</p>
<p class="bas indent1"><span class="nm">(k)</span><span class="cl">Question:</span> The Mishnah continues, 'you are obligated to guard them.' Regarding man, it should say 'he must guard himself'!</p>
<p class="bas indent2"><span class="nm">1.</span><span class="cl">Counter-question:</span> Karna taught that there are four Avos Nezikin, and man is one of them. How does he explain why the Mishnah didn't say 'man must guard himself'?</p>
<p class="bas indent2"><span class="nm">2.</span><span class="cl">Answer (R. Avahu):</span> The Mishnah should say (regarding man), 'man must guard himself'.</p>
<p class="bas bbbline">4b----------------------------------------4b</p>
<p class="bas indent1"><span class="nm">(l)</span><span class="cl">Answer:</span> Rav will also say, the Mishnah should say 'man must guard himself'.</p>
<p class="bas indent1"><span class="nm">(m)</span><span class="cl">Question (Rav Mari):</span> We should say that Mav'eh is water - "like water Tiv'eh (bubbles) because of fire"!</p>
<p class="bas indent1"><span class="nm">(n)</span><span class="cl">Answer:</span> The singular conjugation "Tiv'eh" shows that the verb refers to fire (which makes the water bubble), not Mayim (water, which is plural in Hebrew grammar).</p>
<p class="bas indent1"><span class="nm">(o)</span><span class="cl">Question (Rav Zvid):</span> We should say that Mav'eh is fire - "like fire Tiv'eh (makes bubble) water"!</p>
<p class="bas indent1"><span class="nm">(p)</span><span class="cl">Answer:</span> This cannot be. Our Mishnah lists Mav'eh and Hev'er (fire).</p>
<p class="bas indent2"><span class="nm">1.</span><span class="cl">Suggestion:</span> Perhaps Hev'er explains what Mav'eh is!</p>
<p class="bas indent2"><span class="nm">2.</span><span class="cl">Objection:</span> If so, the Mishnah only listed three Avos (but it says there are four)!</p>
<p class="bas indent2"><span class="nm">3.</span><span class="cl">Suggestion:</span> Perhaps it counts an ox like two (Regel and Shen, which are Mu'ad from the beginning).</p>
<p class="bas indent2"><span class="nm">4.</span><span class="cl">Rejection ((Mishnah):</span> The leniency of an ox and Mav'eh, which are alive, is unlike that of fire.;</p>
<p class="bas indent3"><span class="nm">i.</span>Fire is not alive! Also, it says, Mav'eh is not like fire!</p>
<p class="bas subject"><span class="nm">3)</span>OTHER DAMAGERS</p>
<p class="bas indent1"><span class="nm">(a)</span><span class="cl">(R. Oshiya):</span> There are 13 Avos Nezikin: a Shomer Chinam (one who guards a deposit for free), a borrower, a Shomer Sachar (he is paid to guard it), one who rents an object; Nezek (lifelong loss in earning potential), pain, medical expenses, Sheves, and embarrassment; and the four Avos of our Mishnah.</p>
<p class="bas indent1"><span class="nm">(b)</span><span class="cl">Question:</span> Why did our Tana list only four?</p>
<p class="bas indent1"><span class="nm">(c)</span><span class="cl">Answer #1 (according to Shmuel):</span> Our Tana lists only damage of a man's money, not of man himself.</p>
<p class="bas indent1"><span class="nm">(d)</span><span class="cl">Answer #2 (according to Rav):</span> Our Tana listed man. This includes all damages of man.</p>
<p class="bas indent1"><span class="nm">(e)</span><span class="cl">Question:</span> Why did R. Oshiya list separately these damages of man?</p>
<p class="bas indent1"><span class="nm">(f)</span><span class="cl">Answer:</span> He distinguishes a man who damages an animal from a man who damages a man.</p>
<p class="bas indent1"><span class="nm">(g)</span><span class="cl">Question:</span> If so, he should also list separately an animal that damages man, and an animal that damages an animal!</p>
<p class="bas indent1"><span class="nm">(h)</span><span class="cl">Answer:</span> No. When man damages man, he pays four more damages than when he damages an animal, so there is reason to list them separately;</p>
<p class="bas indent2"><span class="nm">1.</span>An animal always pays only Nezek!</p>
<p class="bas indent1"><span class="nm">(i)</span><span class="cl">Question:</span> R. Oshiya listed the four Shomrim, which are cases of man damaging animals!</p>
<p class="bas indent1"><span class="nm">(j)</span><span class="cl">Answer:</span> He lists overt damage, and damage that happens by itself. The Mishnah lists only overt damage.</p>
<p class="bas indent1"><span class="nm">(k)</span><span class="cl">(R. Chiya):</span> There are 24 Avos Nezikin: the double payment of a thief, the payment of four or five times (the value of an animal sold or slaughtered after it was stolen), a thief, a Gazlan (open robber), Edim Zomemim (witnesses who testify about something they were not present to see);</p>
<p class="bas indent2"><span class="nm">1.</span>One who rapes or entices (a virgin Na'arah), Motzi Shem Ra (one who falsely claims that the Na'arah he married was not a virgin);</p>
<p class="bas indent2"><span class="nm">2.</span>One who is Metamei (e.g. food), one who mixes Terumah with Chulin, one who pours libations to idolatry, and the 13 Avos of R. Oshiya.</p>
<p class="bas indent1"><span class="nm">(l)</span><span class="cl">Question:</span> Why did R. Oshiya omit these other 11 Avos?</p>
<p class="bas indent1"><span class="nm">(m)</span><span class="cl">Answer:</span> He lists only payments of principal, but not fines.</p>
<p class="bas indent1"><span class="nm">(n)</span><span class="cl">Question:</span> He should have listed (the principal paid by) a thief and Gazlan!</p>
<p class="bas indent1"><span class="nm">(o)</span><span class="cl">Answer:</span> These are included in the Shomrim.</p>
<p class="bas indent1"><span class="nm">(p)</span><span class="cl">Question:</span> Why did R. Chiya list them separately?</p>
<p class="bas indent1"><span class="nm">(q)</span><span class="cl">Answer:</span> A Shomer received the property in a permitted way. A thief or Gazlan took it improperly.</p>
