<p class="bas subject"><span class="nm">1)</span>ENTERING ERETZ YISRAEL</p>
<p class="bas indent1"><span class="nm">(a)</span><span class="cl">(Beraisa):</span> Many miracles were done on that day (when Yisrael crossed the Jordan).</p>
<p class="bas indent2"><span class="nm">1.</span>Yisrael crossed the Jordan (the water piled up while they crossed);</p>
<p class="bas indent2"><span class="nm">2.</span>They came to Har Gerizim and Har Eival, a journey of more than 60 Mil;</p>
<p class="bas indent2"><span class="nm">3.</span>No one was able to oppose them. Anyone who tried immediately lost control of his bowels (from fright).</p>
<p class="bas indent3"><span class="nm">i.</span>"I will send my terror before you, and I will confound the nation you will come upon";</p>
<p class="bas indent3"><span class="nm">ii.</span>"Terror and fear should fall upon them, until Your nation will pass" refers to the first entry into Eretz Yisrael (with Yehoshua);</p>
<p class="bas indent3"><span class="nm">iii.</span>"Until will pass this nation that You acquired" refers to the second entry (with Ezra).</p>
<p class="bas indent3"><span class="nm">iv.</span>The juxtaposition shows that the second entry should have been miraculous, like the first, but sins prevented this.</p>
<p class="bas indent2"><span class="nm">4.</span>They brought the rocks, built the Mizbe'ach, plastered it, and wrote the entire Torah on it in 70 languages - "well explained."</p>
<p class="bas indent2"><span class="nm">5.</span>They offered Olos and Shelamim, ate, drank, rejoiced, and said the Berachos and curses.</p>
<p class="bas indent2"><span class="nm">6.</span>They dissembled the rocks of the Mizbe'ach and came to Gilgal to spend the night - "you will carry them with you and place them at the lodging where you will spend the night.</p>
<p class="bas indent3"><span class="nm">i.</span><span class="cl">Suggestion:</span> Perhaps they may leave them at any lodging!</p>
<p class="bas indent3"><span class="nm">ii.</span><span class="cl">Rejection:</span> It must be "where you will spend the night."</p>
<p class="bas indent1"><span class="nm">(b)</span><span class="cl">(Beraisa):</span> The hornet (that killed their enemies) did not cross the Jordan with them.</p>
<p class="bas indent1"><span class="nm">(c)</span><span class="cl">Question:</span> "I will send the hornet in front of you"!</p>
<p class="bas indent1"><span class="nm">(d)</span><span class="cl">Answer #1 (Reish Lakish):</span> It stayed on the east bank of the Jordan and shot poison at the Kena'anim, blinding them and castrating them - "and I destroyed their fruit from above and their roots from below."</p>
<p class="bas indent1"><span class="nm">(e)</span><span class="cl">Answer #2 (Rav Papa):</span> There were two hornets. One was in the wars Moshe fought (against Sichon and Og), which did not cross the Jordan. There was one in Yehoshua's wars, which did cross.</p>
<p class="bas subject"><span class="nm">2)</span>THE NAMES OF THE <i>SHEVATIM </i>ON THE STONES OF THE <i>EPHOD</i></p>
<p class="bas indent1"><span class="nm">(a)</span><span class="cl">(Mishnah):</span> Six Shevatim went on Har Gerizim...</p>
<p class="bas indent1"><span class="nm">(b)</span><span class="cl">Question:</span> Why does the verse say "the half (on Har Eival)"?</p>
<p class="bas indent1"><span class="nm">(c)</span><span class="cl">Answer #1 (Rav Kahana):</span> The division of the tribes into two groups of six was the same like the division of their names on the two stones of the Efod.</p>
<p class="bas indent1"><span class="nm">(d)</span><span class="cl">Question (Beraisa):</span> "Six of their names were on one stone, and the six remaining on the second stone, like their birth." They are like (the order of) their birth on the second stone, but not on the first, for Yehudah was written first. There were 25 letters in the names on each stone;</p>
<p class="bas indent2"><span class="nm">1.</span>R. Chanina ben Gamliel says, the tribes are not ordered like at the beginning of Sefer Bamidbar, rather, like at the beginning of Shemos.</p>
<p class="bas bbbline">36b----------------------------------------36b</p>
<p class="bas indent2"><span class="nm">2.</span>The first stone has the sons of Leah, in order of their birth. Rachel's two sons are at the top and bottom of the second stone, and the sons of Zilpah and Bilhah are in between.</p>
<p class="bas indent2"><span class="nm">3.</span><span class="cl">Question:</span> It says "like their birth"!</p>
<p class="bas indent2"><span class="nm">4.</span><span class="cl">Answer:</span> They are written like Yakov called them at birth, not like they are written later in the Torah;</p>
<p class="bas indent3"><span class="nm">i.</span>It says 'Reuven', not (the tribe of) 'Reuveni'...</p>
<p class="bas indent2"><span class="nm">5.</span>Rav Kahana is refuted. (Shimon, Levi, Yehudah, Yisachar, Yosef and Binyamin were on Har Gerizim. This does not correspond to the Shevatim on one stone according to either Tana.)</p>
<p class="bas indent1"><span class="nm">(e)</span><span class="cl">Question:</span> How can we explain why it says "the half"?</p>
<p class="bas indent1"><span class="nm">(f)</span><span class="cl">Answer (Beraisa):</span> The half (of the Shevatim) on Har Gerizim had more people than the half on Har Eival, because part of Levi stayed below.</p>
<p class="bas indent1"><span class="nm">(g)</span><span class="cl">Objection:</span> To the contrary! (Levi was on Har Gerizim.) Because part of Levi stayed below, there should be fewer on Har Gerizim!</p>
<p class="bas indent1"><span class="nm">(h)</span><span class="cl">Answer:</span> The Beraisa means, even though part of Levi stayed below, there were more on Har Gerizim, because Yosef was with them;</p>
<p class="bas indent2"><span class="nm">1.</span>"Bnei Yosef said to Yehoshua 'why did you only give us one portion? We are numerous!' Yehoshua answered 'if so, go to the forest.'"</p>
<p class="bas indent2"><span class="nm">2.</span>He advised them to hide themselves in the forest, lest an Ayin ha'Ra (envy, which arouses harsh judgments) harm them.</p>
<p class="bas indent2"><span class="nm">3.</span>They told him that Ayin ha'Ra does not harm the seed of Yosef;</p>
<p class="bas indent3"><span class="nm">i.</span><span class="cl">(R. Avahu):</span> We may read "Alei Ayin" like Olei Ayin (they ascend over the (evil) eye).</p>
<p class="bas indent3"><span class="nm">ii.</span><span class="cl">(R. Yosi bar Chanina):</span> (Yakov blessed Yosef's children) "they will increase like fish in the midst of the land." Just like fish are covered in the water, and the (evil) eye does not rule over them, also the eye does not rule over the seed of Yosef.</p>
<p class="bas indent1"><span class="nm">(i)</span><span class="cl">Question:</span> When you count the letters of the names of the tribes, there are only 49, not 50! (The Beraisa said that there were 25 letters on each stone.)</p>
<p class="bas indent1"><span class="nm">(j)</span><span class="cl">Answer #1 (R. Yitzchak):</span> A letter (Hei) was added to Yosef's name - "Testimony in Yehosef is his name..."</p>
<p class="bas indent1"><span class="nm">(k)</span><span class="cl">Objection (Rav Nachman bar Yitzchak):</span> It says "like their birth." His name was Yosef at birth!</p>
<p class="bas indent1"><span class="nm">(l)</span><span class="cl">Answer #2:</span> In all other places, Binyamin is spelled with only one Yud. On the stone, it was spelled like at his birth, with an extra Yud.</p>
<p class="bas subject"><span class="nm">3)</span>YOSEF SANCTIFIED HASH-M'S NAME</p>
<p class="bas indent1"><span class="nm">(a)</span><span class="cl">(Rav Chana bar Bizna):</span> Yosef sanctified Hash-m's name in private, and one letter of His name was added to Yosef's name. Yehudah sanctified Hash-m's name in public, so his name includes all letters of Hash-m's name.</p>
<p class="bas indent1"><span class="nm">(b)</span><span class="cl">(R. Yochanan):</span> "On a day like this, he (Yosef) came to the house to do his work" - he and Potifar's wife both intended to sin.</p>
<p class="bas indent1"><span class="nm">(c)</span><span class="cl">(Rav or Shmuel):</span> Yosef came to do his tasks.</p>
<p class="bas indent1"><span class="nm">(d)</span><span class="cl">(The other of Rav and Shmuel):</span> Yosef came to be with her.</p>
<p class="bas indent1"><span class="nm">(e)</span><span class="cl">Question:</span> It is unreasonable that "there was no one in the house." The evil Potifar had a very large household!</p>
<p class="bas indent1"><span class="nm">(f)</span><span class="cl">Answer (Tana d'Vei R. Yishmael):</span> It was their festival. They all went to their worship. She claimed that she was sick, thinking that this was her best day to be with Yosef.</p>
<p class="bas indent1"><span class="nm">(g)</span>"She grabbed him by his garment, saying..." - the image of Yakov appeared to Yosef in the window.</p>
<p class="bas indent2"><span class="nm">1.</span>Yakov said to him 'your brothers' names will be written on the stones of the Efod. Also your name should be there. Do you want (to sin, causing) that your name should be erased, and you will be called a manager of harlots?!</p>
<p class="bas indent3"><span class="nm">i.</span>"A manager of harlots loses great wealth."</p>
<p class="bas indent1"><span class="nm">(h)</span><span class="cl">(R. Yochanan):</span> "His strength was firmly founded" - his Ever was erected. "And gushed out from his hands" - he stuck his hands in the ground, and the semen came out from between his fingernails.</p>
<p class="bas indent1"><span class="nm">(i)</span>"At the hands of the might of Yakov" - the might of Yakov caused Yosef's name to be written on the stones of the Efod. "From there, a shepherd of the Rock of Yisrael" - from there, he merited to become a shepherd - "shepherd of Yisrael, listen, lead the flock like Yosef."</p>
<p class="bas indent1"><span class="nm">(j)</span><span class="cl">(Beraisa):</span> Twelve Shevatim should have descended from Yosef, like from Yakov - "these are the descendants of Yakov, Yosef." Since the semen exuded from his (10) fingernails, he merited only two sons;</p>
<p class="bas indent1"><span class="nm">(k)</span>Nevertheless, the 10 he lost descended from Binyamin, and Binyamin gave all of them names related to Yosef:</p>
<p class="bas indent2"><span class="nm">1.</span>Bela - he (Yosef) was Nivla (swallowed) among the nations;</p>
<p class="bas indent2"><span class="nm">2.</span>Becher - he was Bechor (firstborn) to his mother;</p>
<p class="bas indent2"><span class="nm">3.</span>Ashbel - Hash-m took him captive (Shavo Kel);</p>
<p class="bas indent2"><span class="nm">4.</span>Gera - he was Gar (lived) by hosts;</p>
<p class="bas indent2"><span class="nm">5.</span>Na'aman - he was extremely Na'im (pleasing);</p>
<p class="bas indent2"><span class="nm">6.</span>Achi and Rosh - he was Achi (my brother) and Roshi (my leader);</p>
<p class="bas indent2"><span class="nm">7.</span>Mupim and Chupim - he did not see my Chupah, and I did not see his. (Rashi - Medrash Tanchuma explains the name Mupim, because his Pi (mouth) was (fluent) like Yakov's in the Halachos Yakov learned from Shem and Ever.)</p>
<p class="bas indent2"><span class="nm">8.</span>Ard - he descended (Yarad) among the nations. Others say, his face was like a Varad (rose).</p>
<p class="bas subject"><span class="nm">4)</span>YOSEF LEARNED THE SEVENTY LANGUAGES</p>
<p class="bas indent1"><span class="nm">(a)</span><span class="cl">(R. Chiya bar Aba):</span> When Pharaoh put Yosef in power, Pharaoh's astrologers objected: will you put a slave, who was bought for 20 pieces of silver, over us?!'</p>
<p class="bas indent2"><span class="nm">1.</span><span class="cl">Pharaoh:</span> I see qualities of kingship in him.</p>
<p class="bas indent2"><span class="nm">2.</span><span class="cl">The astrologers:</span> If so, he should know the 70 languages!</p>
<p class="bas indent1"><span class="nm">(b)</span>Gavri'el came to teach the 70 languages to him. Yosef was unable to learn until a Hei from Hash-m's name was added to Yosef's name - "Testimony in Yehosef is his name, in his going out over Mitzrayim..."</p>
<p class="bas indent1"><span class="nm">(c)</span>The next day, he was able to answer Pharaoh in every language Pharaoh spoke to him. Yosef spoke to Pharaoh in Hebrew, and Pharaoh did not understand. Pharaoh asked him to teach him Hebrew, but he was unable to learn.</p>
<p class="bas indent1"><span class="nm">(d)</span>Pharaoh made Yosef swear that Yosef will not reveal that Pharaoh does not know Hebrew.</p>
<p class="bas indent2"><span class="nm">1.</span>When Yosef asked to bury his father in Eretz Yisrael, as he had sworn, Pharaoh told him to ask (a Chacham) to permit his oath.</p>
<p class="bas indent2"><span class="nm">2.</span><span class="cl">Yosef:</span> If so, I could also permit my oath to you (not to reveal), even though it is against your will!</p>
<p class="bas indent2"><span class="nm">3.</span>Pharaoh told Yosef to fulfill his oath to bury his father.</p>
