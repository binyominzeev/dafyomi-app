<p class="bas subject"><span class="nm">1)</span>A FORCED SALE (cont.)</p>
<p class="bas indent1"><span class="nm">(a)</span><span class="cl">Answer #2 (Beraisa):</span> "Yakriv" teaches that if Levi must bring an Olah, Beis Din forces him to bring it.</p>
<p class="bas indent2"><span class="nm">1.</span><span class="cl">Suggestion:</span> Perhaps we force him against his will!</p>
<p class="bas indent2"><span class="nm">2.</span><span class="cl">Rejection:</span> It says "li'Rtzono" (willingly).</p>
<p class="bas indent2"><span class="nm">3.</span><span class="cl">Question:</span> How do we fulfill both verses?</p>
<p class="bas indent2"><span class="nm">4.</span><span class="cl">Answer:</span> We force him until he says 'I want to bring it'.</p>
<p class="bas indent1"><span class="nm">(b)</span><span class="cl">Rejection:</span> Perhaps there is different, for he truly wants to bring the Olah in order to get atonement!</p>
<p class="bas indent1"><span class="nm">(c)</span><span class="cl">Answer #3 (Seifa):</span> Similarly, (if one is obligated to divorce his wife but refuses to,) we force him until he says 'I want' (to authorize Sheluchim to write and give a Get).</p>
<p class="bas indent1"><span class="nm">(d)</span><span class="cl">Objection:</span> Perhaps there he truly wants, because it is a Mitzvah to heed Chachamim (who ruled that he must divorce her)!</p>
<p class="bas indent1"><span class="nm">(e)</span><span class="cl">Answer #4:</span> Rather, reason dictates that amidst the coercion, he resolves to sell (since he gets the proper price).</p>
<p class="bas indent1"><span class="nm">(f)</span><span class="cl">Question (Rav Yehudah - Mishnah):</span> If (a Beis Din of) Yisrael forces a man to divorce his wife, it is valid. If Nochrim force him, it is invalid;</p>
<p class="bas indent2"><span class="nm">1.</span>Nochrim beat him and say 'do what Beis Din of Yisrael tell you.'</p>
<p class="bas indent2"><span class="nm">2.</span><span class="cl">Summation of question:</span> Why is it invalid when Nochrim coerce (on their own)? We should say that amidst the coercion, he decides absolutely to divorce!</p>
<p class="bas indent1"><span class="nm">(g)</span><span class="cl">Answer (Rav Mesharshiya):</span> Mid'Oraisa, it is valid. Chachamim decreed that it is invalid, lest women get Nochrim to force their husbands to divorce them.</p>
<p class="bas indent1"><span class="nm">(h)</span><span class="cl">Question (Rav Hamnuna - Mishnah):</span> If Reuven bought a field from a Sikrikon, then bought it from the real owner (Shimon), his purchase is void;</p>
<p class="bas indent2"><span class="nm">1.</span>We should say that amidst the coercion, he decides absolutely to sell!</p>
<p class="bas indent1"><span class="nm">(i)</span><span class="cl">Answer:</span> Indeed, if Reuven paid Shimon, the sale is valid;</p>
<p class="bas indent2"><span class="nm">1.</span><span class="cl">(Rav):</span> The Mishnah discusses when Shimon told Reuven to acquire through Chazakah, but if Shimon wrote a document (we assume that he was paid), Reuven acquires.</p>
<p class="bas indent1"><span class="nm">(j)</span><span class="cl">Question:</span> According to Shmuel, how can we answer?</p>
<p class="bas indent2"><span class="nm">1.</span><span class="cl">(Shmuel):</span> Even if Shimon wrote a document, Reuven does not acquire unless Shimon wrote in the document that he accepts Acharayos.</p>
<p class="bas indent1"><span class="nm">(k)</span><span class="cl">Answer:</span> Shmuel agrees that if Reuven paid Shimon, the sale is valid. (He argues with Rav and says that a document does not prove that he paid.)</p>
<p class="bas indent1"><span class="nm">(l)</span><span class="cl">Question:</span> According to Rav Bivi, how can we answer?</p>
<p class="bas indent2"><span class="nm">1.</span><span class="cl">(Rav Bivi citing Rav Nachman):</span> If a robber brings a proof, we do not establish him to own the land, but he gets back the money he paid.</p>
<p class="bas indent1"><span class="nm">(m)</span><span class="cl">Answer:</span> Rav Huna and Rav Bivi are both Amora'im, they argue with each other.</p>
<p class="bas indent1"><span class="nm">(n)</span><span class="cl">(Rava):</span> The Halachah is, if Reuven hung Shimon until Shimon agreed to sell his property, the sale is valid;</p>
<p class="bas indent2"><span class="nm">1.</span>This is only when Reuven asked to buy a field. If he asked for a specific field, it is invalid;</p>
<p class="bas bbbline">48b----------------------------------------48b</p>
<p class="bas indent2"><span class="nm">2.</span>The sale of a specific field is invalid only if Shimon did not count the money (this shows that he did not accept willingly).</p>
<p class="bas indent2"><span class="nm">3.</span>It is invalid only if Shimon had no way to evade Reuven, but if he did, it is valid.</p>
<p class="bas subject"><span class="nm">2)</span>FORCED KIDUSHIN</p>
<p class="bas indent1"><span class="nm">(a)</span>The Halachah is, in all cases the sale is valid, even for a specific field, for this resembles the following law of Kidushin (in which the woman gets no choice):</p>
<p class="bas indent2"><span class="nm">1.</span><span class="cl">(Ameimar):</span> If Levi hung Leah until Leah agreed to accept Kidushin from him, the Kidushin is valid.</p>
<p class="bas indent1"><span class="nm">(b)</span><span class="cl">(Mar bar Rav Ashi):</span> Mid'Oraisa, she is Mekudeshes. Mid'Rabanan she is not. Since Levi acted improperly, Chachamim fined him and uprooted the Kidushin.</p>
<p class="bas indent1"><span class="nm">(c)</span><span class="cl">Question (Ravina):</span> Granted, Chachamim can uproot Kidushin of money and say that the money was only a gift.</p>
<p class="bas indent2"><span class="nm">1.</span>But if he was Mekadesh through Biah, how can Chachamim uproot it? (Tosfos - if they uproot the Kidushin, the Bi'ah was Zenus (extramarital relations)!)</p>
<p class="bas indent1"><span class="nm">(d)</span><span class="cl">Answer (Rav Ashi):</span> ( Indeed,) Chachamim transform his Kidushin into an act of Bi'as Zenus.</p>
<p class="bas subject"><span class="nm">3)</span>A MODA'AH AGAINST A FORCED SALE</p>
<p class="bas indent1"><span class="nm">(a)</span>Tavi hung Papi until he agreed to sell him land. Rabah bar bar Chanah signed on a Moda'ah (saying that Papi is acting under duress, and he does not agree to sell) and on the document of sale.</p>
<p class="bas indent1"><span class="nm">(b)</span><span class="cl">Rav Huna:</span> A witness may properly sign on a Moda'ah, and on the document of sale.</p>
<p class="bas indent1"><span class="nm">(c)</span><span class="cl">Objection:</span> If the Moda'ah is valid, the sale is not!</p>
<p class="bas indent1"><span class="nm">(d)</span><span class="cl">Correction:</span> He meant that if not for the Moda'ah, the sale would be valid (a sale through coercion is a sale).</p>
<p class="bas indent2"><span class="nm">1.</span>This is like Rav Huna said above.</p>
<p class="bas indent2"><span class="nm">2.</span><span class="cl">(Rav Huna):</span> If Reuven hung Shimon until Shimon agreed to sell his property, the sale is valid.</p>
<p class="bas indent1"><span class="nm">(e)</span><span class="cl">Question:</span> Rav Nachman taught that if witnesses say that the document they signed was Emanah (the 'borrower' trusted the 'lender' with a loan document, even though he did not yet lend the money) or that they signed a sale document about which they heard a Moda'ah from the seller, they are not believed.</p>
<p class="bas indent1"><span class="nm">(f)</span><span class="cl">Answer:</span> They are not believed to say that the seller gave a Moda'ah, for their speech cannot override the document they signed, but if they signed a Moda'ah, this invalidates the document they signed.</p>
