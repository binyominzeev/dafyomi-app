<p class="bas subject"><span class="nm">1)</span>REWARDS GIVEN TO LOT'S DAUGHTERS</p>
<p class="bas indent1"><span class="nm">(a)</span><span class="cl">(R. Chiya bar Aba):</span> Hash-m rewards even for modest words.</p>
<p class="bas indent2"><span class="nm">1.</span>Lot's older daughter shamelessly called her son Mo'av (like me'Av, from father). The Torah said "do not besiege Mo'av, and do not wage war against them." War is forbidden, but we may afflict them;</p>
<p class="bas indent2"><span class="nm">2.</span>Lot's younger daughter modestly called her son Ben Ami (the son of my nation). The Torah said "do not besiege (Amon), and do not instigate a quarrel with them." We may not pain them at all.</p>
<p class="bas indent1"><span class="nm">(b)</span><span class="cl">(R. Chiya bar Avin):</span> One should always be quick to do a Mitzvah. Because Lot's older daughter slept with Lot one night before her sister, she merited to have a descendant in Yisrael (Oved, the son of Rus the Mo'avis) four generations earlier (than Rechav'om, the son of Na'amah the Amonis).</p>
<p class="bas subject"><span class="nm">2)</span>DIFFERENT LAWS OF A <i>MASHU'ACH</i> AND <i>NASI</i></p>
<p class="bas indent1"><span class="nm">(a)</span><span class="cl">(Beraisa):</span> "From the common people" excludes a Mashu'ach and a Nasi.</p>
<p class="bas indent1"><span class="nm">(b)</span><span class="cl">Question:</span> The Torah already taught that a Mashu'ach brings a Par, and a Nasi brings a Sa'ir (unlike commoners)!</p>
<p class="bas indent1"><span class="nm">(c)</span><span class="cl">Answer (part 1):</span> One might have thought that a Mashu'ach brings a Par when he sins through Hora'ah, and a Se'irah or Kisvah for Shogeg. The Tana teaches that this is not so.</p>
<p class="bas indent2"><span class="nm">1.</span><span class="cl">Question:</span> This does not explain why we must exclude a Nasi. He brings only for Shogeg!</p>
<p class="bas indent1"><span class="nm">(d)</span><span class="cl">Answer (part 2 - Rav Zvid):</span> The case is, he ate a k'Zayis of Chelev when he was a commoner, and then he was appointed Nasi, and then learned of his sin. One might have thought that he brings like a commoner. The Tana teaches that this is not so (he is exempt).</p>
<p class="bas indent1"><span class="nm">(e)</span><span class="cl">Question:</span> This is like R. Shimon, who follows (says that the law depends on his status at) the time he learns of his sin;</p>
<p class="bas indent2"><span class="nm">1.</span>However, Chachamim follow the time of his sin. If so, he brings like a commoner. When do we exempt a Nasi from a Se'irah or Kisvah?</p>
<p class="bas indent1"><span class="nm">(f)</span><span class="cl">Correction (Rav Zvid):</span> Rather, he ate a half k'Zayis of Chelev when he was a commoner, then he was appointed Nasi, he ate another half k'Zayis (the entire k'Zayis was eaten within the normal allotted time to be liable for eating a k'Zayis), and then learned of his sin. One might have thought that he brings like a commoner. The Tana teaches that this is not so (he is exempt).</p>
<p class="bas indent1"><span class="nm">(g)</span><span class="cl">Question (Rava):</span> Does being Nasi separate (acts of eating, so they will not join)?</p>
<p class="bas indent2"><span class="nm">1.</span><span class="cl">Question:</span> What is the case?</p>
<p class="bas indent2"><span class="nm">2.</span><span class="cl">Answer:</span> He ate a half k'Zayis of Chelev when he was a commoner, he was appointed Nasi, he was deposed, and then ate another half k'Zayis (all within the allotted time) and then learned of his sin.</p>
<p class="bas indent3"><span class="nm">i.</span>Perhaps the two eatings do not join when his status was not the same for both, but here, both times he was a commoner!</p>
<p class="bas indent3"><span class="nm">ii.</span>Or, perhaps in either case, the eatings do not join.</p>
<p class="bas indent1"><span class="nm">(h)</span><span class="cl">Suggestion:</span> We can settle this from Ula's law!</p>
<p class="bas indent2"><span class="nm">1.</span><span class="cl">(Ula):</span> A man ate Chelev; he (later realized this and) separated a Chatas, became a Mumar (idolater) then repented. Since the Korban could not be offered when he was a Mumar, it is permanently disqualified.</p>
<p class="bas indent1"><span class="nm">(i)</span><span class="cl">Rejection:</span> We cannot learn from there. A Mumar cannot bring a Korban, but a Nasi can (just it is different)!</p>
<p class="bas indent1"><span class="nm">(j)</span><span class="cl">Question (R. Zeira):</span> If a commoner ate Safek Safek Chelev, and he was appointed Nasi, and then learned of his (Safek) sin, what is the law?</p>
<p class="bas indent2"><span class="nm">1.</span>Obviously, according to Chachamim, who follow the time of the sin, he brings an Asham Taluy (like a commoner).</p>
<p class="bas indent2"><span class="nm">2.</span>The question is according to R. Shimon. Since his law changed regarding a definite sin, does it also change regarding a Safek sin?</p>
<p class="bas indent3"><span class="nm">i.</span>Or, perhaps his law changes only in the definite case, but not in a case of Safek?</p>
<p class="bas indent1"><span class="nm">(k)</span>This question is unsettled.</p>
<p class="bas subject"><span class="nm">3)</span>A <i>MUMAR</i></p>
<p class="bas indent1"><span class="nm">(a)</span><span class="cl">(Beraisa):</span> "From the common people" excludes a Mumar;</p>
<p class="bas indent1"><span class="nm">(b)</span>R. Shimon bar Yosi says, "(a Mitzvah) that one may not do it, and he forgot, and sinned" - one brings a Korban only if he would not have sinned had he known (that this is forbidden).</p>
<p class="bas indent1"><span class="nm">(c)</span><span class="cl">Question:</span> What do they argue about?</p>
<p class="bas indent1"><span class="nm">(d)</span><span class="cl">Answer #1 (Rav Hamnuna):</span> They argue about whether a Mumar to eat Chelev (one who wantonly eats Chelev) brings a Korban for eating blood.</p>
<p class="bas indent2"><span class="nm">1.</span>The first Tana holds that since he is a Mumar to eat Chelev, he is also a Mumar regarding blood;</p>
<p class="bas indent2"><span class="nm">2.</span>R. Shimon bar Rebbi Yosi holds that since he would not have eaten blood knowingly, he brings a Korban.</p>
<p class="bas indent2"><span class="nm">3.</span><span class="cl">Question:</span> Rava holds that all agree that a Mumar to eat Chelev is not a Mumar to eat blood!</p>
<p class="bas indent1"><span class="nm">(e)</span><span class="cl">Answer #2:</span> The case is, he is a Mumar to eat Neveilah l'Te'avon (for pleasure). He intended to eat Kosher meat, and accidentally ate Neveilah.</p>
<p class="bas indent2"><span class="nm">1.</span>The first Tana holds, since he intentionally sins l'Te'avon, he is like a (standard) Mumar (i.e. idolater);</p>
<p class="bas indent2"><span class="nm">2.</span>R. Shimon bar Yosi holds, since he does not sin when he can fulfill his desire in a permitted way, he is not a Mumar.</p>
<p class="bas indent1"><span class="nm">(f)</span><span class="cl">(Beraisa):</span> If a man ate Chelev, he is a Mumar;</p>
<p class="bas indent2"><span class="nm">1.</span>Who is a Mumar? It is one who eats Neveilos, Treifos, Shekatzim u'Rmasim (insects and swarming rodents), or drinks Yayin Nesech (wine offered to idolatry. Tosfos ha'Rosh - since it is so spiritually revolting, he must be a Mumar; Merumei Sadeh - we discuss wine poured on the ground in front of idolatry);</p>
<p class="bas indent2"><span class="nm">2.</span>R. Yehudah says, even one who wears Sha'atnez is a Mumar.</p>
<p class="bas indent1"><span class="nm">(g)</span><span class="cl">Question:</span> The first Tana contradicts himself!</p>
<p class="bas indent1"><span class="nm">(h)</span><span class="cl">Answer (Rabah bar bar Chanah):</span> It means, if a man ate Chelev because he desired it, he is a Mumar. If he ate to anger Hash-m, he is a Tzeduki;</p>
<p class="bas indent2"><span class="nm">1.</span>What kind of Mumar is assumed to be a Tzeduki? It is one who eats Neveilos, Treifos, insects, Shekatzim u'Rmasim, or drinks Yayin Nesech;</p>
<p class="bas indent2"><span class="nm">2.</span>R. Yehudah says, even one who wears Sha'atnez is a Mumar.</p>
<p class="bas indent2"><span class="nm">3.</span><span class="cl">Question:</span> What do they argue about?</p>
<p class="bas indent2"><span class="nm">4.</span><span class="cl">Answer:</span> They argue about one who wears Sha'atnez mid'Rabanan. Chachamim say that one is Mumar only for Sha'atnez mid'Oraisa;</p>
<p class="bas indent2"><span class="nm">5.</span>R. Yehudah says, since this is a well-known Isur, he is a Mumar even for Sha'atnez mid'Rabanan.</p>
<p class="bas indent1"><span class="nm">(i)</span>Rav Acha and Ravina argued. One said that one who sins l'Te'avon is a Mumar, and one who sins to anger Hash-m is a Tzeduki;</p>
<p class="bas indent2"><span class="nm">1.</span>The other said, even one who sins to anger Hash-m is a Mumar.</p>
<p class="bas indent2"><span class="nm">2.</span><span class="cl">Question:</span> What does he consider to be a Tzeduki?</p>
<p class="bas indent2"><span class="nm">3.</span><span class="cl">Answer:</span> An idolater is a Tzeduki.</p>
<p class="bas indent1"><span class="nm">(j)</span><span class="cl">Question (against the first opinion - Beraisa):</span> One who eats a flea or mosquito is a Mumar.</p>
<p class="bas indent2"><span class="nm">1.</span>Surely, this is to anger Hash-m, and he is only a Mumar!</p>
<p class="bas indent1"><span class="nm">(k)</span><span class="cl">Answer:</span> He does this only to taste what is forbidden, but not to anger Hash-m.</p>
<p class="bas subject"><span class="nm">4)</span>WHO IS CONSIDERED A <i>NAS?I</i></p>
<p class="bas indent1"><span class="nm">(a)</span><span class="cl">(Mishnah):</span> Nasi is a king.</p>
<p class="bas indent1"><span class="nm">(b)</span><span class="cl">(Beraisa) Suggestion:</span> Perhaps "Nasi" refers even to the head of a Shevet, such as Nachshon;</p>
<p class="bas indent1"><span class="nm">(c)</span><span class="cl">Rejection:</span> It says regarding the Nasi "Hash-m Elokav"; like it says about a king;</p>
<p class="bas bbbline">11b----------------------------------------11b</p>
<p class="bas indent2"><span class="nm">1.</span>Just like a king has only Hash-m over him, also a Nasi.</p>
<p class="bas indent1"><span class="nm">(d)</span><span class="cl">Version #1 - Question (Rebbi):</span> Would I be considered a Nasi?</p>
<p class="bas indent1"><span class="nm">(e)</span><span class="cl">Answer (R. Chiya):</span> No. You have a counterpart in Bavel (the Reish Galusa, i.e. the executive head of Yisrael in exile).</p>
<p class="bas indent1"><span class="nm">(f)</span><span class="cl">Question (Rebbi - Beraisa):</span> Kings of (the 10 tribes of) Yisrael and kings of the Davidic line both bring the Korban of a Nasi.</p>
<p class="bas indent1"><span class="nm">(g)</span><span class="cl">Answer (R. Chiya):</span> They were not submissive to each other, but we are submissive to Bavel.</p>
<p class="bas indent1"><span class="nm">(h)</span><span class="cl">Version #2 (Rav Safra) Question (Rebbi):</span> Would I be considered a Nasi?</p>
<p class="bas indent1"><span class="nm">(i)</span><span class="cl">Answer (R. Chiya):</span> No. (The Reish Galusa of) Bavel is the staff (executive authority). Eretz Yisrael (which you head) is (only) the lawmaker.</p>
<p class="bas indent2"><span class="nm">1.</span><span class="cl">(Beraisa):</span> "The staff will not depart from Yehudah" is the Reish Galusa of Bavel, who subjugates Yisrael with a staff;</p>
<p class="bas indent2"><span class="nm">2.</span>"The lawmaker (will not depart) from (Yehudah)" are the descendants of Hillel, who teach Torah to multitudes.</p>
<p class="bas subject"><span class="nm">5)</span>WHO IS A <i>MASHU'ACH</i>?</p>
<p class="bas indent1"><span class="nm">(a)</span><span class="cl">(Mishnah):</span> Which Kohen Gadol is considered Mashu'ach? It is one anointed with Shemen ha'Mishchah, but not Merubah Begadim (he was not anointed. His inauguration was through wearing the extra garments of a Kohen Gadol.)</p>
<p class="bas indent1"><span class="nm">(b)</span>The only difference between a Mashu'ach and Merubah Begadim is that the former brings a Par (for Hora'ah).</p>
<p class="bas indent1"><span class="nm">(c)</span>(If the Kohen Gadol is Tamei or sick on Yom Kipur, another Kohen does the Avodah in his stead. When the former becomes Tahor or healthy, he resumes being Kohen Gadol. He is called the serving Kohen Gadol. The latter is called Kohen she'Avar.) The only difference between them is that serving Kohen <i>pays for</i> the Par (that atones for for the Kohanim) on Yom Kipur and Asiris ha'Efah (the daily Minchah of the Kohen Gadol);</p>
<p class="bas indent1"><span class="nm">(d)</span>The following apply to both of them;</p>
<p class="bas indent2"><span class="nm">1.</span>He may offer the Korbanos on Yom Kipur, he is commanded to marry a virgin, a widow is forbidden to him, he may not become Tamei if a relative dies, he does not grow his hair or tear his clothes over a Mes, and Shogeg murderers in Arei Miklat (refuge cities) go free when he dies.</p>
<p class="bas indent1"><span class="nm">(e)</span><span class="cl">(Gemara - Beraisa #1 - R. Yehudah):</span> To make Shemen ha'Mishchah in the Midbar, they cooked the spices in the oil;</p>
<p class="bas indent2"><span class="nm">1.</span><span class="cl">R. Yosi:</span> There was not even enough oil to rub on the spices! (The spices weighed 1750 Shekalim (about 30 kilograms, so their volume was roughly 50 liters), and there was only one Hin (about four liters) of oil - Shmos 30:23,24.) Rather, they soaked the spices in water, then put the oil on them to absorb the fragrance, then scraped off the oil.</p>
<p class="bas indent2"><span class="nm">2.</span><span class="cl">R. Yehudah:</span> We know that other miracles occurred with Shemen ha'Mishchah (so we can say that also the cooking was a miracle)!</p>
<p class="bas indent3"><span class="nm">i.</span>Only 12 Lugim of oil were made. They used it to anoint the Mishkan, its Kelim, Aharon, and his sons all seven days of the inauguration, and the full measure lasted for all generations!</p>
<p class="bas indent3"><span class="nm">ii.</span>"<i>Zeh</i> (this) will be to Me for generations" (the Gematri'a of "Zeh" is 12).</p>
<p class="bas indent1"><span class="nm">(f)</span><span class="cl">(Beraisa #2 - R. Yehudah):</span> "Moshe took the Shemen ha'Mishchah and anointed the Mishkan and everything in it" - several miracles occurred with the Shemen ha'Mishchah;</p>
<p class="bas indent2"><span class="nm">1.</span>They started with only 12 Lugim. Much should have been lost through absorptions into the pot (in which they cooked it) and the spices, through evaporation during the cooking, through anointing the Mishkan, its Kelim, Aharon and his sons all seven days of the inauguration, and through anointing Kohanim Gedolim and kings;</p>
<p class="bas indent3"><span class="nm">i.</span>A Kohen Gadol must be anointed even if his father was Kohen Gadol, but we do not anoint a king succeeding his father.</p>
<p class="bas indent3"><span class="nm">ii.</span><span class="cl">Question:</span> Some kings who succeeded their fathers were anointed!</p>
<p class="bas indent3"><span class="nm">iii.</span><span class="cl">Answer:</span> In each case, this was to silence a dispute over the kingship. Adoniyahu tried to usurp Shlomo's kingship, Asalyah had seized reign in place of Yeho'ash, and Yehoyakim expected to reign before Yeho'achaz, for he was two years older.</p>
<p class="bas indent2"><span class="nm">2.</span><span class="cl">All the oil is intact for future use:</span> "<i>Zeh</i> will be to Me for generations."</p>
<p class="bas indent1"><span class="nm">(g)</span><span class="cl">Question:</span> The Beraisa requires anointing a Kohen Gadol who succeeds his father. What is the source of this?</p>
<p class="bas indent1"><span class="nm">(h)</span><span class="cl">Answer:</span> "The Kohen <i>ha'Mashi'ach</i> in place of him from his children" - even though he succeeds his father, he is Kohen Gadol only if he was anointed. (Keren Orah - surely, anointing is not Me'akev (essential). The Gemara means that he is not Kohen Gadol due to inheritance unless he was anointed. Note - we said that a Merubah Begadim is a Kohen Gadol, even though he was not anointed. However, one could have explained that until the Shemen ha'Mishchah was hidden, it was Me'akev.)</p>
<p class="bas indent1"><span class="nm">(i)</span><span class="cl">Question:</span> The Beraisa says that we need not anoint a king who succeeds his father. What is the source?</p>
<p class="bas indent1"><span class="nm">(j)</span><span class="cl">Answer (Rav Acha bar Yakov):</span> "In order that his kingship will last (he and his children)" - it is an inheritance.</p>
<p class="bas subject"><span class="nm">6)</span>WHEN THE KINGSHIP IS DISPUTED</p>
<p class="bas indent1"><span class="nm">(a)</span><span class="cl">Question:</span> What is the source that we must anoint his son when there is a dispute, and it does not suffice to say which son will succeed him?</p>
<p class="bas indent1"><span class="nm">(b)</span><span class="cl">Answer (Rav Papa):</span> "He and his children <i>b'Kerev</i> (amidst) Yisrael" - it is an inheritance (only) when there is peace in Yisrael.</p>
<p class="bas indent1"><span class="nm">(c)</span><span class="cl">(Beraisa):</span> Yehu ben Nishmi was anointed because Yoram disputed his kingship.</p>
<p class="bas indent1"><span class="nm">(d)</span><span class="cl">Question:</span> In any case, he needed to be anointed. His father was not king!</p>
<p class="bas indent1"><span class="nm">(e)</span><span class="cl">Answer:</span> The Beraisa is abbreviated. It means that we anoint kings of the Davidic line, but not Malchei Yisrael.</p>
<p class="bas indent2"><span class="nm">1.</span><span class="cl">Question:</span> What is the source of this?</p>
<p class="bas indent2"><span class="nm">2.</span><span class="cl">Answer (Rava):</span> "Go anoint (David) for <i>this one</i>..." - only this (royal line) must be anointed.</p>
<p class="bas indent1"><span class="nm">(f)</span><span class="cl">Question:</span> If Malchei Yisrael are not anointed, Yoram's dispute is no justification for Me'ilah (forbidden usage) of Shemen ha'Mishchah!</p>
<p class="bas indent1"><span class="nm">(g)</span><span class="cl">Answer:</span> We answer like Rav Papa did (to answer a different question). He was anointed with pure Afarsimon oil (not Shemen ha'Mishchah).</p>

<p class="bas indent1"><span class="nm">(i)</span><span class="cl">Answer:</span> Yehoyakim was older. The verse calls Yochanan the firstborn regarding kingship (i.e. he was the first of them to reign).</p>
