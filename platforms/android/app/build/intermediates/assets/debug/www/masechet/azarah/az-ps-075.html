<p class="bas indent1"><span class="nm">(a)</span><span class="cl">Question:</span> How do we dry Kelim?</p>
<p class="bas indent1"><span class="nm">(b)</span><span class="cl">Answer #1 (Rav):</span> We use water (this will be explained).</p>
<p class="bas indent1"><span class="nm">(c)</span><span class="cl">Answer #2 (Rabah bar bar Chanah):</span> We use ashes.</p>
<p class="bas indent1"><span class="nm">(d)</span><span class="cl">Objection:</span> Does Rav say that we use only water, and does Rabah bar bar Chanah say that we use only ashes?!</p>
<p class="bas indent1"><span class="nm">(e)</span><span class="cl">Answer:</span> No. Each mentioned one, but he agrees that we also use the other;</p>
<p class="bas indent2"><span class="nm">1.</span>They do not argue. When it is wet, we first apply ashes. When it is dry, we first apply water.</p>
<p class="bas indent1"><span class="nm">(f)</span>(In all the following versions, we always alternate between applications of water and ashes. When it is wet, we first apply ashes; when it is dry, we first apply water. The last application is always water, but sometimes this is not counted.)</p>
<p class="bas indent1"><span class="nm">(g)</span><span class="cl">Version #1 - Chachamim of Sura - (Rav):</span> There are (a total of) two or three applications of water and ashes (depending on whether it was wet or dry, like we will explain)</p>
<p class="bas indent1"><span class="nm">(h)</span><span class="cl">(Shmuel):</span> There are three or four applications.</p>
<p class="bas indent1"><span class="nm">(i)</span><span class="cl">Version #2 - Chachamim of Pumbadisa - (Rav):</span> There are three or four applications;</p>
<p class="bas indent1"><span class="nm">(j)</span><span class="cl">(Shmuel):</span> There are four or five applications. (End of Version #2)</p>
<p class="bas indent1"><span class="nm">(k)</span>They do not argue. One of them does not count the final application of water (but he admits that it must be done), the other counts it.</p>
<p class="bas indent1"><span class="nm">(l)</span><span class="cl">(Version A (Rashi's Rebbeyim):</span> According to Chachamim of Pumbadisa, Rav and Shmuel do not argue with each other. Rav does not count the final application of water (but he admits that it must be done), and Shmuel counts it.</p>
<p class="bas indent2"><span class="nm">1.</span>According to Chachamim of Sura, Rav and Shmuel both count the final application of water, and they argue with each other. Rav requires ashes (1) and water (2) when it is wet; when it is dry, he adds another application of water at the beginning. Shmuel agrees when it is dry, but if it was wet, he requires ashes (1), water (2), ashes (3), water (4). (See table on this Daf.)</p>
<p class="bas indent1"><span class="nm">(m)</span><span class="cl">Version B (Rashi's father):</span> The Chachamim of Sura and Pumbadisa do not argue with each other. The former do not count the final application of water, but the latter do.</p>
<p class="bas indent1"><span class="nm">(n)</span><span class="cl">Version C (Tosfos):</span> Chachamim of Sura and Pumbadisa argue with each other, but each of them holds that Rav and Shmuel do not argue with each other. Rav does not count the final application of water, and Shmuel counts it.)</p>

<p class="bas indent1"><span class="nm">(a)</span><span class="cl">Question:</span> What is the law of Akalim (a net of poles tied around grapes or olives being pressed) of Nochrim?</p>
<p class="bas indent1"><span class="nm">(b)</span><span class="cl">Answer (R. Avahu - Beraisa):</span> To be Metaher a Gas or olivepress (used with Tamei wine or oil), one must rinse the boards, brooms and tub (used to press, gather and hold the grapes or olives);</p>
<p class="bas indent2"><span class="nm">1.</span>Akalim of shoots and of Kanvus (hemp) must be dried;</p>
<p class="bas indent2"><span class="nm">2.</span>If it is of rush (marsh reeds), one must wait 12 months before using them.</p>
<p class="bas indent2"><span class="nm">3.</span>R. Shimon ben Gamliel says, one must wait until the next season of pressing grapes or olives.</p>
<p class="bas indent2"><span class="nm">4.</span>(Rambam - additionally, all these Kelim must be immersed; Me'iri - Kelim of wood (or other vegetation) without an interior cannot become Tamei, so it suffices to purge the Tamei liquids absorbed in them).</p>
<p class="bas indent2"><span class="nm">5.</span><span class="cl">Question:</span> What is the difference between the first Tana and R. Shimon ben Gamliel? (There is one pressing season per year, after the harvest.)</p>
<p class="bas indent2"><span class="nm">6.</span><span class="cl">Answer:</span> There can be more (or less) than 12 months if the grapes or olives are late (or early) to ripen.</p>
<p class="bas indent2"><span class="nm">7.</span>R. Yosi says, one may be Metaher them immediately by Hag'alah (putting them in boiling water), or scalding through (pouring over them) water in which olives were cooked.</p>
<p class="bas indent2"><span class="nm">8.</span>R. Shimon ben Gamliel says (in R. Yosi's name) that one may put them under a flow of water from a pipe or in a spring for an Onah (a period of time; this will be explained).</p>
<p class="bas indent2"><span class="nm">9.</span>Just like we Kasher from Yayin Nesech, we are Metaher.</p>
<p class="bas indent2"><span class="nm">10.</span><span class="cl">Objection:</span> This Beraisa taught how to be Metaher, and not how to Kasher!</p>
<p class="bas indent2"><span class="nm">11.</span><span class="cl">Correction:</span> Rather, just like we Metaher, we Kasher from Yayin Nesech.</p>
<p class="bas indent1"><span class="nm">(c)</span><span class="cl">Question:</span> What is an Onah?</p>
<p class="bas indent1"><span class="nm">(d)</span><span class="cl">Answer #1 (R. Chiya bar Aba citing R. Yochanan):</span> It is a day (morning until evening) or a night.</p>
<p class="bas indent1"><span class="nm">(e)</span><span class="cl">Answer #2 (R. Chana Sheina citing R. Yochanan):</span> It is 12 hours.</p>
<p class="bas indent1"><span class="nm">(f)</span><span class="cl">(R. Shmuel bar Yitzchak):</span> All agree that it is always 12 hours. R. Chiya bar Aba refers to Nisan or Tishrei, when the day and night are each 12 hours.</p>
<p class="bas indent1"><span class="nm">(g)</span><span class="cl">(Rav Yehudah):</span> Strainers of Nochrim:</p>
<p class="bas indent2"><span class="nm">1.</span>If they are made of hair, it suffices to rinse them;</p>
<p class="bas indent2"><span class="nm">2.</span>If they are made of wool, it suffices to dry them;</p>
<p class="bas indent2"><span class="nm">3.</span>If they are made of linen, one must leave them for 12 months before using them;</p>
<p class="bas indent3"><span class="nm">i.</span>If they have knots, one must untie them (before drying them - Rashi; Ramban - or before leaving them for 12 months).</p>
<p class="bas indent1"><span class="nm">(h)</span>Baskets for straining wine:</p>
<p class="bas indent2"><span class="nm">1.</span>If they are made of ropes of date shoots, it suffices to rinse them;</p>

<p class="bas indent1"><span class="nm">(i)</span><span class="cl">(Rebbi or R. Chiya):</span> If an ignoramus (who is Muchzak to be Tamei) touched grape clusters (resting in wine in a Gas), they and the surrounding clusters are Teme'im, and the rest of the Gas is Tahor;</p>
<p class="bas indent1"><span class="nm">(j)</span><span class="cl">(The other of Rebbi and R. Chiya):</span> The entire Gas is Tamei.</p>
<p class="bas indent1"><span class="nm">(k)</span><span class="cl">Question:</span> According to the first opinion, why is this different than a Sheretz found in a grinder?</p>
<p class="bas indent2"><span class="nm">1.</span><span class="cl">(Mishnah):</span> If a Sheretz was found in an olive-grinder, only what it touched is Tamei;</p>
<p class="bas indent2"><span class="nm">2.</span>If oil was flowing around the olives, everything (touching the oil) is Tamei.</p>
<p class="bas indent1"><span class="nm">(l)</span><span class="cl">Answer:</span> There, the Sheretz touched olives in the oil. Here, the ignoramus touched the branches, and they themselves do not touch the wine (rather, the grapes do).</p>

<p class="bas subject"><span class="nm">3)</span>'KASHERING' 'KELIM' OF 'NOCHRIM'</p>
<p class="bas indent1"><span class="nm">(a)</span><span class="cl">(Mishnah):</span> If one buys from a Nochri a utensil used for food:</p>
<p class="bas indent2"><span class="nm">1.</span>If it does not need to be Kashered, it suffices to immerse it;</p>
<p class="bas indent2"><span class="nm">2.</span>If boiling liquids are cooked in it, it is Kashered through Hag'alah;</p>
<p class="bas indent2"><span class="nm">3.</span>If it is used to cook over a fire without liquid, Libun is needed (he makes it glowing hot);</p>
<p class="bas indent3"><span class="nm">i.</span>A roasting spit or grill is Kashered through Libun.</p>
<p class="bas indent2"><span class="nm">4.</span>A knife is Kashered by rubbing it on a sharpening stone.</p>
<p class="bas indent1"><span class="nm">(b)</span><span class="cl">(Gemara - Beraisa):</span> All of these must be immersed in a Mikveh of 40 Sa'im (Ramban - after it is Kashered; Tosfos - before or after Kashering).</p>
<p class="bas indent1"><span class="nm">(c)</span><span class="cl">Question:</span> What is the source of this?</p>
<p class="bas indent1"><span class="nm">(d)</span><span class="cl">Answer (Rava):</span> "Kol Davar Asher Yavo ba'Esh Ta'aviru ba'Esh <i>v'Taher</i>" - the Torah requires an additional Taharah after Kashering.</p>
<p class="bas indent1"><span class="nm">(e)</span><span class="cl">Question (Bar Kapara):</span> Since it says "b'Mei Nidah Yischata" (which refers to sprinkling with Mei Chatas (water on which ashes of the Parah Adumah were put)), perhaps one must sprinkle on it on the third and seventh day!</p>
<p class="bas indent1"><span class="nm">(f)</span><span class="cl">Answer:</span> "Ach" excludes this (unless the Keli is Tamei Mes).</p>
<p class="bas indent1"><span class="nm">(g)</span><span class="cl">Question:</span> If so, why does it say "b'Mei Nidah"?</p>
<p class="bas indent1"><span class="nm">(h)</span><span class="cl">Answer:</span> This teaches that he must immerse it in water that a Nidah could immerse in, i.e. a Mikveh of 40 Sa'im.</p>
<p class="bas indent1"><span class="nm">(i)</span>The Torah needed to say "v'Taher", and also "b'Mei Nidah";</p>
<p class="bas indent2"><span class="nm">1.</span>Had it said only "v'Taher", one might have thought that a Mikveh of any size suffices. "B'Mei Nidah" teaches that 40 Sa'im are needed;</p>
<p class="bas indent2"><span class="nm">2.</span>Had it said only "b'Mei Nidah", one might have thought that the Keli may not be used until Ha'arev Shemesh (the night after immersion). "V'Taher" teaches that it is permitted immediately after immersion.</p>
<p class="bas indent1"><span class="nm">(j)</span><span class="cl">(Rav Nachman):</span> Even new Kelim must be immersed, for after Libun, a used Keli is like new (yet the Torah requires immersion).</p>
<p class="bas indent1"><span class="nm">(k)</span><span class="cl">Question (Rav Sheshes):</span> If so, even scissors used for cutting wool should require immersion!</p>
<p class="bas indent1"><span class="nm">(l)</span><span class="cl">Answer (Rav Nachman):</span> The Parshah discusses only Kelim (similar to those used with fire, i.e. Kelim) used for food.</p>
<p class="bas indent1"><span class="nm">(m)</span><span class="cl">(Rav Nachman):</span> The obligation to immerse is only when one buys from a Nochri, similar to the spoils of Midyan (which were taken to keep), but not if one borrows a Keli.</p>
<p class="bas indent1"><span class="nm">(n)</span>R. Yitzchak bar Yosef thought to immerse a Keli made of earth (that he bought from a Nochri).</p>
<p class="bas indent1"><span class="nm">(o)</span><span class="cl">R. Ya'akov:</span> The Parshah discusses only metal Kelim. (Nothing else need be immersed.)</p>
<p class="bas indent1"><span class="nm">(p)</span><span class="cl">(Rav Ashi):</span> Since glass Kelim can be (melted and) made again if they break, they resemble metal Kelim, and they require immersion.</p>
<p class="bas indent1"><span class="nm">(q)</span><span class="cl">(Rav Acha or Ravina):</span> The law of an earthenware Keli plated with lead is like the law of the original Keli (earthenware, it need not be immersed);</p>
<p class="bas indent1"><span class="nm">(r)</span><span class="cl">(The other of Rav Acha and Ravina):</span> It has the law of the plating (metal, it must be immersed).</p>
<p class="bas indent2"><span class="nm">1.</span>The Halachah is, it has the law of the plating.</p>
<p class="bas indent1"><span class="nm">(s)</span><span class="cl">Question:</span> If a Nochri gave a Keli for a security for a loan, is this considered like a sale?</p>
<p class="bas indent2"><span class="nm">1.</span><span class="cl">Mar bar Rav Ashi:</span> My father received a silver cup for a security, and he immersed it;</p>
<p class="bas indent2"><span class="nm">2.</span>I do not know whether he holds that giving a security is (always) like a sale, or if he immersed it because he sensed that the Nochri would never pay, rather, he would let him keep it.</p>
<p class="bas subject"><span class="nm">4)</span>THE METHOD OF 'KASHERING'</p>
<p class="bas indent1"><span class="nm">(a)</span><span class="cl">(Beraisa):</span> If a Yisrael buys a new Keli from a Nochri, it suffices to immerse it;</p>
<p class="bas indent1"><span class="nm">(b)</span>If he buys a used Keli:</p>
<p class="bas indent2"><span class="nm">1.</span>If it was used with cold food, such as cups and flasks, he rinses and immerses it;</p>
<p class="bas indent2"><span class="nm">2.</span>If it was used with hot liquids, such as pots and kettles, he does Hag'alah and immerses it;</p>
<p class="bas indent2"><span class="nm">3.</span>If it is used to cook over a fire without liquid, such as spits and grills, he does Libun and immerses it.</p>
<p class="bas indent1"><span class="nm">(c)</span><span class="cl">(Beraisa #1):</span> If he used it before immersing (Ramban; Tosfos - before rinsing), Hag'alah or Libun, the food is forbidden;</p>
<p class="bas indent1"><span class="nm">(d)</span><span class="cl">Contradiction (Beraisa #2):</span> The food is permitted.</p>
<p class="bas indent1"><span class="nm">(e)</span><span class="cl">Resolution:</span> The first Tana forbids Nosen Ta'am li'Fgam (we assume that it is not a Ben Yomo, i.e. the Nochri did not cook in it in the last 24 hours, so any absorbed taste is detrimental). The second Tana permits it.</p>
<p class="bas indent1"><span class="nm">(f)</span><span class="cl">Question:</span> According to the opinion that permits Nosen Ta'am li'Fgam, why did the Torah require Kashering the Kelim taken from Midyan?</p>
<p class="bas indent1"><span class="nm">(g)</span><span class="cl">Answer (Rav Chiya bar Rav Huna):</span> The Torah requires Kashering only a Ben Yomo. It is Nosen Ta'am li'Shvach.</p>
