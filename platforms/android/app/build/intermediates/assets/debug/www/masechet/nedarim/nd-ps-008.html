<p class="dedicationbox">NEDARIM 8 (14 Sivan) - Dedicated by Doug Rabin in memory of his mother, Leah Miriam bat Yisroel (Lucy) Rabin, in honor of her Yahrzeit.<br>12TH CYCLE DEDICATION<br>NEDARIM 7-10 - Two weeks of study material have been dedicated by Mrs. Estanne Abraham Fawer to honor the eighth Yahrzeit of her father, Rav Mordechai ben Eliezer Zvi (Rabbi Morton Weiner) Z'L, who passed away on 18 Teves 5760. May the merit of supporting and advancing Dafyomi study -- which was so important to him -- during the weeks of his Yahrzeit serve as an Iluy for his Neshamah. </p>

<p class="bas subject"><span class="nm">1)</span>AN OATH TO DO A <i>MITZVAH</i></p>
<p class="bas indent1"><span class="nm">(a)</span><span class="cl">(Rav Gidal):</span> "Nishbati va'Akayemah Lishmor Mishpetei Tzidkecha" teaches that one may swear to fulfill a Mitzvah.</p>
<p class="bas indent1"><span class="nm">(b)</span><span class="cl">Question:</span> The oath (of Kabalas ha'Torah) of Sinai already obligates him (so another oath cannot take effect! Ran - we know that there is no Korban for transgressing such an oath. If he teaches that "Lo Yachel Devaro" applies, this is not learned from "Nishbati va'Akayemah"!)</p>
<p class="bas indent1"><span class="nm">(c)</span><span class="cl">Answer:</span> He teaches that it is permitted to make himself zealous (to do the Mitzvah. It is proper, even for Tzadikim who normally do not swear.)</p>
<p class="bas indent1"><span class="nm">(d)</span><span class="cl">(Rav Gidal):</span> If one said '"I will get up early to learn tractate Ploni", this is a great Neder. (Really, it is a Shevu'ah. He means, it is as great as a Neder of Tzedakah.)</p>
<p class="bas indent1"><span class="nm">(e)</span><span class="cl">Question:</span> The oath of Sinai already obligates him!</p>
<p class="bas indent2"><span class="nm">1.</span>Surely, he does not teach that it is proper to do so. He already taught this above!</p>
<p class="bas indent1"><span class="nm">(f)</span><span class="cl">Answer:</span> Since the Torah does not (explicitly) obligate more than saying "Shema Yisrael..." every morning and evening, the Shevu'ah takes effect (even regarding bringing a Korban if he transgresses it).</p>
<p class="bas indent1"><span class="nm">(g)</span><span class="cl">(Rav Gidal):</span> If David said to Levi '"Let us rise early to learn tractate Ploni", David must rise first;</p>
<p class="bas indent2"><span class="nm">1.</span>Hash-m told Yechezkel "Go to the valley, and I will speak with you there", and Yechezkel found the Shechinah already there.</p>
<p class="bas subject"><span class="nm">2)</span>ONE WHO WAS EXCOMMUNICATED IN A DREAM</p>
<p class="bas indent1"><span class="nm">(a)</span><span class="cl">(Rav Yosef):</span> If Levi was excommunicated in a dream, he must get ten people to permit him.</p>
<p class="bas indent1"><span class="nm">(b)</span>The ten must be people who teach Halachos. People who only learn (some texts - Mishnah) do not suffice.</p>
<p class="bas indent2"><span class="nm">1.</span>If one cannot find 10 who teach, he may use ten who learn.</p>
<p class="bas indent2"><span class="nm">2.</span>If one cannot gather 10 who learn, he should sit at the crossroad and give Shalom to passersby (they will return Shalom to him), until ten who learn Halachos have passed.</p>
<p class="bas indent1"><span class="nm">(c)</span><span class="cl">Question (Ravina):</span> If he knows that David excommunicated him in the dream, can David permit him?</p>
<p class="bas indent1"><span class="nm">(d)</span><span class="cl">Answer (Rav Ashi):</span> No. Perhaps David was a Shali'ach from Shamayim only to excommunicate him, but not to permit him.</p>
<p class="bas indent1"><span class="nm">(e)</span><span class="cl">Question (Rav Acha):</span> If David excommunicated him and released him in the dream, what is the law?</p>
<p class="bas indent1"><span class="nm">(f)</span><span class="cl">Answer (Rav Ashi):</span> All dreams contain some nonsense. (Perhaps the permission is nonsense.)</p>

<p class="bas subject"><span class="nm">3)</span>BEING A <i>SHALI'ACH</i> TO PERMIT ONE'S WIFE'S VOW</p>
<p class="bas indent1"><span class="nm">(a)</span><span class="cl">Question (Ravina):</span> Can a man be a Shali'ach for his wife, to permit her Neder through regret? (Ravina wanted to do so for his wife.)</p>
<p class="bas indent1"><span class="nm">(b)</span><span class="cl">Answer (Rav Ashi):</span> He may do so only if he finds (three) people already gathered. If not, he may not assemble a Beis Din to permit it.</p>
<p class="bas indent1"><span class="nm">(c)</span>We learn three things from this:</p>
<p class="bas indent2"><span class="nm">1.</span>A man can be a Shali'ach for his wife's regret.</p>
<p class="bas indent2"><span class="nm">2.</span>One cannot permit a Neder in his Rebbi's region. (If not, Ravina would have permitted her himself or asked his Talmidim to do so.)</p>
<p class="bas indent2"><span class="nm">3.</span>One can be a Shali'ach for his wife's regret only if three are already gathered.</p>
<p class="bas indent1"><span class="nm">(d)</span>One can permit excommunication even in his Rebbi's town.</p>
<p class="bas indent1"><span class="nm">(e)</span>An outstanding Chacham can permit excommunication by himself.</p>
<p class="bas subject"><span class="nm">4)</span>REWARD AND PUNISHMENT THROUGH THE SUN</p>
<p class="bas indent1"><span class="nm">(a)</span><span class="cl">(Rav Shimon bar Zevid):</span> "V'Zarchah Lachem Yir'ei Shemi" refers to people who are afraid to say Hash-m's Name in vain;</p>
<p class="bas indent1"><span class="nm">(b)</span><span class="cl">(Abaye):</span> Dust that can be seen (only) in the sun heals - "Shemesh Tzedakah u'Marpei."</p>
<p class="bas indent1"><span class="nm">(c)</span>He argues with Reish Lakish:</p>
<p class="bas indent2"><span class="nm">1.</span><span class="cl">(Reish Lakish):</span> In the world to come, there is no Gehinom for Resha'im. (Ran - he discusses after Techiyas ha'Meisim. He agrees that there is Gehinom after death.) Rather, Hash-m will remove the sun from its case;</p>
<p class="bas indent2"><span class="nm">2.</span>It will heal Tzadikim - "Shemesh Tzedakah u'Marpei." They will delight in it - "u'Fishtem k'Eglei Marbek";</p>
<p class="bas indent2"><span class="nm">3.</span>It will punish Resha'im - "Hinei Yom Bo'er ka'Tanur..."</p>
