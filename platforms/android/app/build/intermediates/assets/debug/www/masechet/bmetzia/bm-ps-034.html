<p class="bas subject"><span class="nm">1)</span>HOW THE <i>SHOMER</i> GETS <i>KEFEL</i></p>
<p class="bas indent1"><span class="nm">(a)</span><span class="cl">Version #1 - Answer #1 (Rava):</span> It is considered as if Reuven stipulated (when he gave over the deposit) 'if it will be stolen and you will want to pay, it is acquired to you from now.'</p>
<p class="bas indent1"><span class="nm">(b)</span><span class="cl">Objection (R. Zeira):</span> If so, the shearings and offspring (from when he took the deposit) should belong to Shimon (but this is not so)!</p>
<p class="bas indent2"><span class="nm">1.</span><span class="cl">(Beraisa):</span> Shimon receives everything, except for the shearings and offspring.</p>
<p class="bas indent1"><span class="nm">(c)</span><span class="cl">Answer #2 (R. Zeira):</span> It is considered as if Reuven stipulated 'if it will be stolen and you will want to pay, it is acquired to you from now, except for the shearings and offspring.'</p>
<p class="bas indent1"><span class="nm">(d)</span><span class="cl">Question:</span> Why should Reuven stipulate this way?</p>
<p class="bas indent1"><span class="nm">(e)</span><span class="cl">Answer:</span> People normally give away profit that comes from another source (Kefel), but not profit that comes from their own property.</p>
<p class="bas indent1"><span class="nm">(f)</span><span class="cl">Version #2 - Answer (Rava):</span> It is considered as if Reuven stipulated 'if it will be stolen and you will want to pay, it is acquired to you just before it is stolen.'</p>
<p class="bas indent1"><span class="nm">(g)</span><span class="cl">Question:</span> What is the difference between the two versions?</p>
<p class="bas indent1"><span class="nm">(h)</span><span class="cl">Answer #1:</span> R. Zeira's question does not apply to Version #2.</p>
<p class="bas indent1"><span class="nm">(i)</span><span class="cl">Answer #2:</span> The animal was in a swamp just before it was stolen. (Since it cannot be acquired there, Shimon would not get Kefel.)</p>
<p class="bas subject"><span class="nm">2)</span>MUST THE <i>SHOMER</i> ACTUALLY PAY?</p>
<p class="bas indent1"><span class="nm">(a)</span><span class="cl">(Mishnah):</span> If he paid and did not want to swear...</p>
<p class="bas indent1"><span class="nm">(b)</span><span class="cl">(R. Chiya bar Aba):</span> Even if he did not pay, once he said that he wants to pay, he acquires Kefel.</p>
<p class="bas indent1"><span class="nm">(c)</span><span class="cl">Question:</span> The Mishnah said 'if he paid and did not want to swear.' This shows that he must pay!</p>
<p class="bas indent2"><span class="nm">1.</span><span class="cl">Counter-question (Reisha):</span> If Shimon swore and did not want to pay...</p>
<p class="bas indent2"><span class="nm">2.</span>He does not get Kefel because he did not want to pay. Had he wanted to pay, he would get it!</p>
<p class="bas indent2"><span class="nm">3.</span><span class="cl">Conclusion:</span> The inferences contradict one another. We cannot determine which is correct. The Mishnah neither supports nor refutes R. Chiya.</p>
<p class="bas indent1"><span class="nm">(d)</span><span class="cl">Support (Beraisa):</span> If Reuven rented a cow from Shimon, and it was stolen, and Reuven said 'I will pay and not swear', and the thief was found, he pays Kefel to Reuven.</p>
<p class="bas indent1"><span class="nm">(e)</span><span class="cl">(Rav Papa):</span> A Shomer Chinam acquires Kefel once he says that he was negligent (the owner consents), for he could have exempted himself by saying that it was stolen;</p>
<p class="bas indent1"><span class="nm">(f)</span>A Shomer Sachar acquires Kefel once he says that he was stolen, for he could have exempted himself by saying that it died through Ones;</p>
<p class="bas indent1"><span class="nm">(g)</span><span class="cl">Version #1:</span> If a borrower says that he will pay, he does not acquire;</p>
<p class="bas indent2"><span class="nm">1.</span>He could exempt himself only by saying that it died while working, and this is uncommon. (He is reluctant to claim this, lest people suspect that he is lying.)</p>
<p class="bas indent1"><span class="nm">(h)</span><span class="cl">Version #2:</span> Also a borrower acquires once he says that he will pay, for he could have exempted himself by saying that it died while working. (end of Version #2)</p>
<p class="bas indent1"><span class="nm">(i)</span><span class="cl">Question (Rav Zvid):</span> Abaye said that a borrower does not acquire until he actually pays!</p>
<p class="bas indent2"><span class="nm">1.</span><span class="cl">Question:</span> What is Abaye's reason?</p>
<p class="bas indent2"><span class="nm">2.</span><span class="cl">Answer:</span> Since a borrower gets free benefit, the owner does not want him to acquire with mere words.</p>
<p class="bas indent1"><span class="nm">(j)</span><span class="cl">Support (for Abaye - Beraisa):</span> If Shimon borrowed a cow from Reuven and it was stolen, and Shimon paid first, and then the thief was found, Shimon receives Kefel.</p>
<p class="bas indent1"><span class="nm">(k)</span><span class="cl">Question:</span> This does not refute Rav Papa according to Version #1 (Rav Papa did not say what the law is if he actually pays);</p>
<p class="bas indent2"><span class="nm">1.</span>However, it refutes Version #2 of Rav Papa (he gets Kefel only because he paid)!</p>
<p class="bas indent1"><span class="nm">(l)</span><span class="cl">Answer:</span> We can answer like we answered the Mishnah (which said similarly). The same applies once he says that he will pay.</p>
<p class="bas indent1"><span class="nm">(m)</span><span class="cl">Question:</span> The Beraisa says 'he paid <i>first</i>.' The Mishnah did not say this!</p>
<p class="bas indent1"><span class="nm">(n)</span><span class="cl">Answer:</span> It means, he said first (that he will pay, before the thief was found).</p>
<p class="bas indent1"><span class="nm">(o)</span><span class="cl">Question:</span> Regarding a renter, it says 'he said.' Regarding a borrower it says 'he paid', to show that he must pay first!</p>
<p class="bas indent1"><span class="nm">(p)</span><span class="cl">Answer:</span> This inference is invalid, for a different Beraisa discusses a renter.</p>
<p class="bas indent1"><span class="nm">(q)</span><span class="cl">Rejection:</span> We asked the Chachamim who learn the Tosefta (authenticated Beraisos) of R. Chiya and R. Oshiya. They said that they are parts of the same Beraisa.</p>
<p class="bas subject"><span class="nm">3)</span>IN WHICH SITUATIONS DOES THE <i>SHOMER</i> GET <i>KEFEL</i>?</p>
<p class="bas indent1"><span class="nm">(a)</span>Clearly, if the Shomer first said that he will not pay, and then decided to pay, he acquires.</p>
<p class="bas indent1"><span class="nm">(b)</span><span class="cl">Question #1:</span> If first he said that he will pay, and then decided not to pay, what is the law?</p>
<p class="bas bbbline">34b----------------------------------------34b</p>
<p class="bas indent2"><span class="nm">1.</span>Since he retracted, he does not acquire?</p>
<p class="bas indent2"><span class="nm">2.</span>Or, perhaps he really intends to pay, but not right now?</p>
<p class="bas indent1"><span class="nm">(c)</span><span class="cl">Question #2:</span> If Shimon said that he will pay, then he died, and his heirs say that they will not pay, what is the law?</p>
<p class="bas indent2"><span class="nm">1.</span>Since they retract, they do not acquire?</p>
<p class="bas indent2"><span class="nm">2.</span>Or, perhaps they really intend to pay, but not right now?</p>
<p class="bas indent1"><span class="nm">(d)</span><span class="cl">Question #3:</span> If Shimon's heirs paid, what is the law?</p>
<p class="bas indent2"><span class="nm">1.</span>Can Reuven say 'I wanted only your father to get Kefel, since he was very nice to me, but not that you should get it!'</p>
<p class="bas indent2"><span class="nm">2.</span>Or, is there no difference?</p>
<p class="bas indent1"><span class="nm">(e)</span><span class="cl">Question #4:</span> If (Reuven died and) Shimon paid Reuven's heirs, what is the law?</p>
<p class="bas indent2"><span class="nm">1.</span>Can they say 'our father would have given you Kefel, since you were very nice to him.' We do not give it to you!</p>
<p class="bas indent2"><span class="nm">2.</span>Or, is there no difference?</p>
<p class="bas indent1"><span class="nm">(f)</span><span class="cl">Questions:</span> What is the law in the following cases:</p>
<p class="bas indent2"><span class="nm">1.</span>Shimon's heirs paid Reuven's heirs;</p>
<p class="bas indent2"><span class="nm">2.</span>Shimon paid half;</p>
<p class="bas indent2"><span class="nm">3.</span>Shimon borrowed two cows and paid for one;</p>
<p class="bas indent2"><span class="nm">4.</span>Shimon borrowed from two partners and paid one of them;</p>
<p class="bas indent2"><span class="nm">5.</span>Two partners borrowed, and one of them paid;</p>
<p class="bas indent2"><span class="nm">6.</span>Shimon borrowed from a married woman, and paid her husband;</p>
<p class="bas indent2"><span class="nm">7.</span>A married woman borrowed, and her husband paid.</p>
<p class="bas indent1"><span class="nm">(g)</span>None of these questions are resolved.</p>
<p class="bas subject"><span class="nm">4)</span>THE <i>SHOMER</i> MUST SWEAR</p>
<p class="bas indent1"><span class="nm">(a)</span><span class="cl">(Rav Huna):</span> A Shomer who wants to pay must swear that the deposit is not in his premises.</p>
<p class="bas indent1"><span class="nm">(b)</span><span class="cl">Question:</span> What is the reason?</p>
<p class="bas indent1"><span class="nm">(c)</span><span class="cl">Answer:</span> We suspect lest he wants to keep the deposit for himself. (The question from the following Mishnah appears at the top of 35a. First, the Gemara explains the Mishnah.)</p>
<p class="bas indent1"><span class="nm">(d)</span><span class="cl">Question (Mishnah):</span> Reuven lent Shimon and took a security, and he lost the security. Reuven says that he lent one Sela, and the security was worth half a Sela (he demands payment of half a Sela):</p>
<p class="bas indent2"><span class="nm">1.</span>If Shimon says that the security was worth one Sela, the same as the loan, Shimon is exempt from swearing (since he says that he does not owe anything);</p>
<p class="bas indent2"><span class="nm">2.</span>If Reuven says like above (that he lent a Sela, and the security was worth half a Sela), and Shimon says that the loan was one, and the security was worth three quarters, Shimon must swear (since he admits that he owes a quarter, i.e. part of the claim).</p>
<p class="bas indent2"><span class="nm">3.</span>If Shimon says 'I borrowed one Sela, and the security was worth two. You owe me one', and Reuven says that the loan and security were both worth one, Reuven need not swear (he denies owing anything);</p>
<p class="bas indent2"><span class="nm">4.</span>If Shimon says like above (he claims one), and Reuven says that the loan was one, and the security was worth one and a quarter, Reuven must swear.</p>
<p class="bas indent2"><span class="nm">5.</span>The one holding the security swears, lest one will swear and the other will show the security (and prove that the first swore falsely about its value).</p>
<p class="bas indent2"><span class="nm">6.</span><span class="cl">Question:</span> To which case does this refer?</p>
<p class="bas indent3"><span class="nm">i.</span><span class="cl">Suggestion:</span> It applies to case 4.</p>
<p class="bas indent3"><span class="nm">ii.</span><span class="cl">Rejection:</span> Even without this concern, Reuven swears, for he partially admits to the claim!</p>
<p class="bas indent2"><span class="nm">7.</span><span class="cl">Answer (Shmuel):</span> This applies to the Reisha (when Reuven claims from Shimon).</p>
<p class="bas indent2"><span class="nm">8.</span><span class="cl">Question:</span> There are two cases in the Reisha (1 and 2). To which does Shmuel refer?</p>
<p class="bas indent2"><span class="nm">9.</span><span class="cl">Answer:</span> He refers to case 2, in which Shimon partially admitted. Mid'Oraisa, Shimon must swear. Chachamim enacted that instead Reuven swears, lest Shimon swear and Reuven show the security to prove that Shimon swore falsely about its value.</p>
