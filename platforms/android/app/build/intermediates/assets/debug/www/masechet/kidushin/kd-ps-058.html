<p class="bas subject"><span class="nm">1)</span>ONE MAY NOT EAT CHULIN B'AZARAH</p>
<p class="bas indent1"><span class="nm">(a)</span><span class="cl">Question:</span> This only forbids eating unblemished animals (slaughtered in the Mikdash), for they are Kosher for Korbanos;</p>
<p class="bas indent2"><span class="nm">1.</span>What is the source for blemished animals?</p>
<p class="bas indent1"><span class="nm">(b)</span><span class="cl">Answer:</span> The same applies to them, for they are the same species as animals fitting for Korbanos.</p>
<p class="bas indent1"><span class="nm">(c)</span><span class="cl">Question:</span> What is the source for Chayos?</p>
<p class="bas indent1"><span class="nm">(d)</span><span class="cl">Answer:</span> The Torah explicitly says that they require slaughter like Beheimos.</p>
<p class="bas indent1"><span class="nm">(e)</span><span class="cl">Question:</span> What is the source for birds?</p>
<p class="bas indent1"><span class="nm">(f)</span><span class="cl">Answer:</span> It says "he will slaughter it", "he will slaughter it", he will slaughter it." (Just like one may not slaughter Chayos and birds in the Mikdash, just like Beheimos, one may not eat them if they were slaughtered in the Mikdash, like Beheimos.)</p>
<p class="bas indent1"><span class="nm">(g)</span><span class="cl">Suggestion:</span> Perhaps one may not slaughter, but if he slaughtered, he may feed it to dogs!</p>
<p class="bas indent1"><span class="nm">(h)</span><span class="cl">Rejection:</span> "You will cast it (a Tereifah) to the dogs", but not Chulin ba'Azarah.</p>
<p class="bas indent1"><span class="nm">(i)</span><span class="cl">(Beraisa - R. Shimon):</span> If one was Mekadesh a woman with a firstborn donkey, with meat cooked with milk, or Chulin ba'Azarah, she is Mekudeshes;</p>
<p class="bas indent1"><span class="nm">(j)</span>Chachamim say, she is not Mekudeshes.</p>
<p class="bas indent1"><span class="nm">(k)</span><span class="cl">Inference:</span> R. Shimon forbids Chulin ba'Azarah only mid'Rabanan.</p>
<p class="bas indent1"><span class="nm">(l)</span><span class="cl">Contradiction (Mar Yehudah - Mishnah - R. Shimon):</span> Chulin ba'Azarah must be burned. The same applies to a Chayah slaughtered in the Mikdash.</p>
<p class="bas indent1"><span class="nm">(m)</span>Rav Yosef and Rav Shmuel Brei d'Rabah bar Rav Huna could not answer.</p>
<p class="bas indent1"><span class="nm">(n)</span><span class="cl">Answer (Rabah):</span> R. Shimon says that she is Mekudeshes with Chulin ba'Azarah when it was found to be Tereifah.</p>
<p class="bas indent2"><span class="nm">1.</span>This is like R. Shimon taught elsewhere, that a slaughter that does not permit the meat is not considered slaughter.</p>
<p class="bas indent2"><span class="nm">2.</span><span class="cl">(Beraisa - R. Shimon):</span> If one slaughtered a Tereifah (or after Shechitah found that it is a Tereifah), and it was Chulin ba'Azarah, it is permitted to benefit from it;</p>
<p class="bas indent2"><span class="nm">3.</span>Chachamim forbid benefit from it.</p>
<p class="bas subject"><span class="nm">2)</span>THE SALE OF ISUREI HANA'AH</p>
<p class="bas indent1"><span class="nm">(a)</span><span class="cl">(Mishnah):</span> If he sold (any of these) and was Mekadesh with the money, she is Mekudeshes.</p>
<p class="bas indent1"><span class="nm">(b)</span><span class="cl">Question:</span> What is the source for this?</p>
<p class="bas indent1"><span class="nm">(c)</span><span class="cl">Answer:</span> It says about idolatry "v'Hayisa (you will be) Cherem (condemned) like it" - whatever you will make of (exchange for) it, it is (Asur b'Hana'ah,) like the idolatry.</p>
<p class="bas indent2"><span class="nm">1.</span><span class="cl">Inference:</span> Regarding other Isurim, what he receives in exchange for them is permitted.</p>
<p class="bas indent1"><span class="nm">(d)</span><span class="cl">Question:</span> Why don't we learn from idolatry to other Isurim?</p>
<p class="bas indent1"><span class="nm">(e)</span><span class="cl">Answer:</span> Idolatry and Shemitah are Shnei Kesuvim (two verses, one of which could have been learned from the other), so we do not learn from them.</p>
<p class="bas indent1"><span class="nm">(f)</span><span class="cl">Question:</span> What is the source for Shemitah?</p>
<p class="bas indent1"><span class="nm">(g)</span><span class="cl">Answer:</span> "Yovel Hi Kodesh Tihyeh Lachem" - just like Kodesh forbids money exchanged for it, also Peros Shemitah.</p>
<p class="bas indent1"><span class="nm">(h)</span><span class="cl">Suggestion:</span> Just like Kodesh forbids (money exchanged for it) and it itself becomes permitted, also Peros Shemitah.</p>
<p class="bas indent1"><span class="nm">(i)</span><span class="cl">Rejection:</span> "Tihyeh" - the Peros remain (forbidden,) like they are.</p>
<p class="bas indent2"><span class="nm">1.</span>If one bought meat with Peros Shemitah, both require Bi'ur (when that species of Peros is not available to Chayos in the field, one may leave in his house only the amount for three meals);</p>
<p class="bas indent2"><span class="nm">2.</span>If he then bought fish with the meat, the fish gets Kedushas Shemitah in place of the meat;</p>
<p class="bas indent2"><span class="nm">3.</span>If he then bought wine with the fish, the wine is in place of the fish;</p>
<p class="bas indent2"><span class="nm">4.</span>The rule is, the last thing bought is like Shemitah, and also the original Peros.</p>
<p class="bas indent1"><span class="nm">(j)</span><span class="cl">Question:</span> This is like the opinion that we may not learn from Shnei Kesuvim.</p>
<p class="bas indent2"><span class="nm">1.</span>According to the opinion that learns from Shnei Kesuvim, what is the source that she is Mekudeshes with money from the sale of other Isurei Hana'ah?</p>
<p class="bas indent1"><span class="nm">(k)</span><span class="cl">Answer:</span> It says "for it (idolatry) is Cherem", and "it is Yovel (in which Peros get Kedushas Shemitah)" - only these forbid what they are exchanged for.</p>
<p class="bas subject"><span class="nm">3)</span>TOVAS HANA'AH</p>
<p class="bas indent1"><span class="nm">(a)</span><span class="cl">(Mishnah):</span> If a man, even if he is not a Kohen or Levi, was Mekadesh with any of the following, she is Mekudeshes:</p>
<p class="bas indent2"><span class="nm">1.</span>Terumos, Ma'asros or Matanos (parts of a Chulin animal that are given to a Kohen);</p>
<p class="bas indent2"><span class="nm">2.</span>Water or ashes of the red heifer.</p>
<p class="bas indent1"><span class="nm">(b)</span><span class="cl">(Gemara - Ula):</span> Tovas Hana'ah (the right to decide to whom one will give gifts) is not considered like one's money.</p>
<p class="bas indent1"><span class="nm">(c)</span><span class="cl">Question (Rava - Mishnah):</span> If a man, even a Yisrael, was Mekadesh with Terumos, Ma'asros or Matanos, she is Mekudeshes.</p>
<p class="bas indent1"><span class="nm">(d)</span><span class="cl">Answer (Ula):</span> The case is, the Yisrael inherited Tevel (untithed Peros) from his mother's father (who was a Kohen);</p>
<p class="bas indent2"><span class="nm">1.</span>Ula considers Tevel to contain gifts (given to Kohanim), as if they were separated. (It is as if the grandfather fully owned the gifts. The Yisrael inherited them, not just the Tovas Hana'ah.)</p>
<p class="bas indent1"><span class="nm">(e)</span><span class="cl">Question (R. Chiya bar Avin):</span> Is Tovas Hana'ah considered like money?</p>
<p class="bas indent1"><span class="nm">(f)</span><span class="cl">Answer (Rav Huna - Mishnah):</span> If a man, even a Yisrael, was Mekadesh with Terumos, Ma'asros or Matanos, she is Mekudeshes.</p>
<p class="bas indent1"><span class="nm">(g)</span><span class="cl">Question (R. Chiya bar Avi):</span> We established the Mishnah to discuss a Yisrael who inherited Tevel from his mother's father!</p>
<p class="bas bbbline">58b----------------------------------------58b</p>
<p class="bas indent1"><span class="nm">(h)</span><span class="cl">Rav Huna:</span> You are a Hotza'ah!</p>
<p class="bas indent1"><span class="nm">(i)</span>R. Chiya bar Avin was embarrassed. He though Rav Huna meant that he distorts things.</p>
<p class="bas indent2"><span class="nm">1.</span>Really, Rav Huna meant that R. Chiya holds like Rav Asi of Hutzal.</p>
<p class="bas indent1"><span class="nm">(j)</span><span class="cl">Suggestion:</span> The following Tana'im argue about whether or not Tovas Hana'ah is like money.</p>
<p class="bas indent2"><span class="nm">1.</span><span class="cl">(Beraisa - Rebbi):</span> If Reuven stole Shimon's Tevel, he must pay the value of the Tevel;</p>
<p class="bas indent2"><span class="nm">2.</span>Rebbi Yosi b'Rebbi Yehudah says, he pays the value of the Chulin that one keeps from the Tevel.</p>
<p class="bas indent2"><span class="nm">3.</span><span class="cl">Suggestion:</span> Rebbi obligates also the Tovas Hana'ah because (Shimon lost the privilege to give the Terumah and Ma'asros to whom he wanted, and) this is like money. Rebbi Yosi b'Rebbi Yehudah exempts, for it is unlike money.</p>
<p class="bas indent1"><span class="nm">(k)</span><span class="cl">Rejection #1:</span> All agree that Tovas Hana'ah is unlike money. The case is, Shimon inherited Tevel from his grandfather (a Kohen);</p>
<p class="bas indent2"><span class="nm">1.</span>They argue about whether or not we consider Tevel to contain gifts that were separated. Rebbi says that we do (Shimon's grandfather fully owned them, and Shimon inherited them). Rebbi Yosi b'Rebbi Yehudah says that we do not.</p>
<p class="bas indent1"><span class="nm">(l)</span><span class="cl">Rejection #2:</span> All consider Tevel to contain gifts that were separated, and hold that Tovas Hana'ah is unlike money. They argue about Shmuel's law.</p>
<p class="bas indent2"><span class="nm">1.</span><span class="cl">(Shmuel):</span> If one separated one blade of wheat to be Terumah, this exempts the entire harvest.</p>
<p class="bas indent2"><span class="nm">2.</span>Rebbi holds like Shmuel. (Shimon could have given a miniscule amount of Terumah, therefore we do not deduct the amount (about 2%) that people usually give for Terumah);</p>
<p class="bas indent2"><span class="nm">3.</span>Rebbi Yosi b'Rebbi Yehudah argues with Shmuel (he obligates separating at least one part in 60 for Terumah, so Reuven need not pay for this).</p>
<p class="bas indent1"><span class="nm">(m)</span><span class="cl">Rejection:</span> #3: Both hold unlike Shmuel. Letter of the law, the thief should be exempt for the amount that Shimon needed to give to the Kohen;</p>
<p class="bas indent2"><span class="nm">1.</span>Rebbi holds that we fine the thief to pay for it.</p>
<p class="bas indent1"><span class="nm">(n)</span><span class="cl">Rejection:</span> #4: Both hold like Shmuel. Letter of the law, we should not deduct from Reuven's liability the amount of Terumah that would have been separated;</p>
<p class="bas indent2"><span class="nm">1.</span>Rebbi Yosi b'Rebbi Yehudah deducts it to penalize Shimon for having delayed separating Terumah.</p>
<p class="bas subject"><span class="nm">4)</span>TAKING PAYMENT FOR MITZVOS</p>
<p class="bas indent1"><span class="nm">(a)</span><span class="cl">(Mishnah):</span> If one was Mekadesh a woman with water or ashes of the red heifer, she is Mekudeshes.</p>
<p class="bas indent1"><span class="nm">(b)</span><span class="cl">Contradiction (Mishnah #1):</span> If one takes wages for a Mitzvah, the Mitzvah is invalid;</p>
<p class="bas indent2"><span class="nm">1.</span>If he is a judge or witness, his judgment or testimony is invalid;</p>
<p class="bas indent2"><span class="nm">2.</span>If he sprinkled the water of the red heifer, or was Mekadesh (put the ashes on) the water, the water and ashes do not Metaher.</p>
<p class="bas indent1"><span class="nm">(c)</span><span class="cl">Answer (Abaye):</span> One may take (and be Mekadesh a woman with) wages for the exertion of transporting and drawing the water. One may not take wages for sprinkling or Kidush.</p>
<p class="bas indent1"><span class="nm">(d)</span><span class="cl">Support:</span> Our Mishnah discusses Kidushin with water and ashes of the red heifer. Mishnah #1 discusses sprinkling and Kidush.</p>
<p class="perekline">PEREK HA'OMER</p>
<p class="bas subject"><span class="nm">5)</span>DEVIOUS KIDUSHIN</p>
<p class="bas indent1"><span class="nm">(a)</span><span class="cl">(Mishnah):</span> If Reuven told his friend (Shimon) 'go be Mekadesh Plonis to me', and Shimon went and was Mekadesh her to himself, she is Mekudeshes to him;</p>
<p class="bas indent1"><span class="nm">(b)</span>Similarly, if Reuven told Leah 'you are Mekudeshes to me after 30 days', and Moshe was Mekadesh her during the 30 days, she is Mekudeshes to Moshe;</p>
<p class="bas indent2"><span class="nm">1.</span>If Moshe is a Kohen and Leah is a Bas Yisrael, she may eat Terumah.</p>
<p class="bas indent1"><span class="nm">(c)</span>If Reuven told Leah 'you are Mekudeshes to me from now and after 30 days', and Moshe was Mekadesh her during the 30 days, she is Mekudeshes and not Mekudeshes;</p>
<p class="bas indent2"><span class="nm">1.</span>If he is a Kohen and she is a Bas Yisrael, or he is a Yisrael and she is a Bas Kohen, she may not eat Terumah.</p>
<p class="bas indent1"><span class="nm">(d)</span><span class="cl">(Gemara):</span> If Reuven told his friend...</p>
<p class="bas indent1"><span class="nm">(e)</span><span class="cl">(Beraisa):</span> Shimon's Kidushin takes effect, but he acted like a swindler.</p>
<p class="bas indent2"><span class="nm">1.</span>Our Mishnah agrees. It says 'he went', i.e. he went with deceit.</p>
