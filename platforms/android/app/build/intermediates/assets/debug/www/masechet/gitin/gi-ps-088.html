<p class="bas subject"><span class="nm">1)</span>A <i>GET</i> IN TWO COLUMNS</p>
<p class="bas indent1"><span class="nm">(a)</span><span class="cl">Question:</span> The fact that the Get finishes in another column suggests that it was not written at once;</p>
<p class="bas indent2"><span class="nm">1.</span>If the first column ends with 'behold you are' and the second column begins with 'permitted', perhaps after writing the first column, the husband canceled the Get, and later resumed writing in the second column!</p>
<p class="bas indent1"><span class="nm">(b)</span><span class="cl">Answer:</span> We are not concerned for such far-fetched possibilities.</p>
<p class="bas indent1"><span class="nm">(c)</span><span class="cl">Answer #2 (to Question (3:g, 87b) - Rav Ashi):</span> The case is, we can see from the parchment that the scribe intended to write the Get in two columns.</p>
<p class="bas subject"><span class="nm">2)</span>WHAT ARE VALID SIGNATURES?</p>
<p class="bas indent1"><span class="nm">(a)</span><span class="cl">(Mishnah):</span> If the witnesses signed at the top (or side, it is Pasul).</p>
<p class="bas indent1"><span class="nm">(b)</span><span class="cl">Question:</span> Rav used to sign at the side!</p>
<p class="bas indent1"><span class="nm">(c)</span><span class="cl">Answer #1:</span> The top of Rav's signature faced the Get. The Mishnah disqualifies when the top faces away from the Get.</p>
<p class="bas indent2"><span class="nm">1.</span><span class="cl">Question (Mishnah):</span> If two Gitin are written on one page, and the witnesses signed in between, if each Get begins at the signatures (and goes outwards), both are Pasul;</p>
<p class="bas indent3"><span class="nm">i.</span>The Get above the top of the signatures should be valid!</p>
<p class="bas indent2"><span class="nm">2.</span><span class="cl">Answer:</span> The case is, the signatures are sideways. Their top faces the side of the page.</p>
<p class="bas indent2"><span class="nm">3.</span><span class="cl">Question (Seifa):</span> If one of the Gitin ends at the signatures, it is Kosher. The other is Pasul.</p>
<p class="bas indent3"><span class="nm">i.</span>If the signatures are sideways, they are not read with either Get!</p>
<p class="bas indent1"><span class="nm">(d)</span><span class="cl">Answer #2:</span> Rather, Rav used to sign his name at the side on letters to summon parties to Beis Din.</p>
<p class="bas indent1"><span class="nm">(e)</span><span class="cl">(Mishnah):</span> If a Get is in Kesav Sofer (the scribe's handwriting) and one witness signed, it is Kosher.</p>
<p class="bas indent1"><span class="nm">(f)</span><span class="cl">(R. Yirmeyah):</span> The text of the Mishnah says 'if a Get has Chasam Sofer (the scribe signed it) and one other witness signed, it is Kosher.'</p>
<p class="bas indent2"><span class="nm">1.</span><span class="cl">(Rav Chisda):</span> The Mishnah is like R. Yosi (who says that a Shali'ach cannot appoint other Sheluchim. The Chachamim who argue would disqualify Chasam Sofer, lest the husband told Sheluchim to ask other witnesses to sign, and they asked the scribe to sign lest he be insulted that he was not asked.)</p>
<p class="bas indent1"><span class="nm">(g)</span>A Kesuvah came in front of R. Avahu. Witnesses recognized the handwriting of the document and one of the witnesses. R. Avahu was about to be Mekayem (validate) the document based on this.</p>
<p class="bas indent1"><span class="nm">(h)</span><span class="cl">R. Yirmeyah:</span> The text of the Mishnah is Chasam Sofer. (Kesav Sofer and one witness do not suffice.)</p>
<p class="bas subject"><span class="nm">3)</span>WHAT IS CONSIDERED GETTING OLD</p>
<p class="bas indent1"><span class="nm">(a)</span><span class="cl">(Mishnah):</span> If family names of the husband and wife were used, it is Kosher.</p>
<p class="bas indent1"><span class="nm">(b)</span><span class="cl">(Beraisa):</span> A family name may be used in a Get, until 10 generations;</p>
<p class="bas indent1"><span class="nm">(c)</span>R. Shimon ben Elazar says, it may be used only until three generations.</p>
<p class="bas indent1"><span class="nm">(d)</span><span class="cl">(R. Chanina):</span> A family name may be used in a Get until three generations.</p>
<p class="bas indent2"><span class="nm">1.</span>R. Chanina holds like R. Shimon ben Elazar.</p>
<p class="bas indent1"><span class="nm">(e)</span><span class="cl">(Rav Huna):</span> R. Shimon ben Elazar learns from "when you will bear children and grandchildren, and grow old in the land."</p>
<p class="bas indent1"><span class="nm">(f)</span><span class="cl">(R. Yehoshua ben Levi):</span> Eretz Yisrael was made desolate (the 10 tribes were exiled) only after seven families of kings (of the 10 tribes) served idolatry - Yarav'am, Basha... and Hoshe'a ben Elah, like it says "the widow bore seven..."</p>
<p class="bas indent1"><span class="nm">(g)</span><span class="cl">(R. Ami):</span> He learns from "when you will bear children and grandchildren and grow old."</p>
<p class="bas indent1"><span class="nm">(h)</span><span class="cl">Question (Rav Kahana and Rav Asi):</span> "(Hoshe'a ben Elah) was wicked, but not as bad like the kings of Yisrael who preceded him." If so, why "Shalmaneser (Sancheriv) will come upon him"?</p>
<p class="bas indent1"><span class="nm">(i)</span><span class="cl">Answer (Rav):</span> Yarav'am had set up guards to prevent Yisrael from alighting to Yerushalayim on the festivals. Hoshe'a abolished the guards, but Yisrael still did not come;</p>
<p class="bas indent2"><span class="nm">1.</span>Hash-m decreed that Yisrael would be exiled corresponding to the years they did not alight.</p>
<p class="bas indent1"><span class="nm">(j)</span><span class="cl">Question (Rav Chisda):</span> "Hash-m was diligent to bring the evil upon us, for He is a Tzadik." Why is this a reason?</p>
<p class="bas indent1"><span class="nm">(k)</span><span class="cl">Answer #1 (Rav Chisda):</span> Hash-m did Tzedakah (a great benefit) for us by exiling (1000 Chachamim with) Yechanyah (to Bavel) before the exile of (most of Yisrael with) Tzidkiyahu (so Yisrael would have teachers) - "ha'Cheresh veha'Masger Elef)</p>
<p class="bas indent2"><span class="nm">1.</span>"Cheresh" are Chachamim who make others like deaf-mutes (unable to challenge what was said). "Masger" are great Chachamim, that when they finish, no one opens (questions their conclusion).</p>
<p class="bas indent1"><span class="nm">(l)</span><span class="cl">Answer #2 (Ula):</span> Hash-m benefited us by not allowing us to stay in the land for 852 years (the numerical value of "v'Noshantem (you will become antiquated)," lest we be subject to the accompanying curse "you will perish." Rather, He exiled us two years before this.</p>
<p class="bas bbbline">88b----------------------------------------88b</p>
<p class="bas indent2"><span class="nm">1.</span><span class="cl">(Rav Acha bar Yakov):</span> We may derive that 852 years is considered 'quickly' according to Hash-m's standards ("you will quickly perish").</p>
<p class="bas subject"><span class="nm">4)</span>A COERCED <i>GET</i></p>
<p class="bas indent1"><span class="nm">(a)</span><span class="cl">(Mishnah):</span> If (a Beis Din of) Yisre'elim forced a man to divorce his wife, it is valid. If Nochrim forced him, it is Pasul;</p>
<p class="bas indent2"><span class="nm">1.</span>The case is, the Nochrim beat him, telling him to do like Chachmei Yisrael say.</p>
<p class="bas indent1"><span class="nm">(b)</span><span class="cl">(Gemara - Rav Nachman):</span> A Get coerced legally (i.e. when he is obligated to divorce) by Yisre'elim is valid. If it was illegally coerced, it is Pasul and is Posel (disqualifies her from Kehunah).</p>
<p class="bas indent1"><span class="nm">(c)</span>If it was coerced legally by Nochrim, it is Pasul and is Posel. If it was coerced illegally by Nochrim, it is not even Posel.</p>
<p class="bas indent1"><span class="nm">(d)</span><span class="cl">Question:</span> If Nochrim have the power to force us to divorce, a legally coerced Get should be valid. If they have no such power, it should not be Posel!</p>
<p class="bas indent1"><span class="nm">(e)</span><span class="cl">Answer #1 (Rav Mesharshiya):</span> Mid'Oraisa, a Get legally coerced by Nochrim is valid. Chachamim decreed that it is Pasul, lest women who want to be divorced get Nochrim to coerce their husbands.</p>
<p class="bas indent1"><span class="nm">(f)</span><span class="cl">Objection:</span> If so, a Get coerced illegally should be Posel, just like a Get coerced illegally by Yisre'elim!</p>
<p class="bas indent2"><span class="nm">1.</span>Rav Mesharshiya's answer is wrong.</p>
<p class="bas indent1"><span class="nm">(g)</span><span class="cl">Answer #2:</span> Mid'Oraisa, a Get legally coerced by Nochrim is Pasul. Chachamim decreed that it is Posel, lest it be confused with a Get coerced legally by Yisrael.</p>
<p class="bas indent2"><span class="nm">1.</span>A Get coerced illegally by Nochrim will not be confused with a Get coerced legally by Yisrael, so there is no need to decree.</p>
<p class="bas indent1"><span class="nm">(h)</span>Rav Yosef was forcing a man to give a Get.</p>
<p class="bas indent1"><span class="nm">(i)</span><span class="cl">Question (Abaye):</span> We (Chachamim of Bavel) are like commoners. We cannot coerce to divorce!</p>
<p class="bas indent2"><span class="nm">1.</span><span class="cl">(Beraisa - R. Meir):</span> "These are the judgments that you will put before them" - one may not go for judgment in front of Nochrim, even if their law (in the case) is the same as Torah law;</p>
<p class="bas indent2"><span class="nm">2.</span>Also, we expound "before them (expert judges)", and not before commoners.</p>
<p class="bas indent1"><span class="nm">(j)</span><span class="cl">Answer (Rav Yosef):</span> We are Sheluchim (to coerce Gitin) on behalf of the expert judges in Eretz Yisrael, just like we are their Sheluchim to judge cases of admissions (of debt) and loans.</p>
<p class="bas indent1"><span class="nm">(k)</span><span class="cl">Question:</span> If so, we should be Sheluchim also to judge thefts and injuries!</p>
<p class="bas indent1"><span class="nm">(l)</span><span class="cl">Answer:</span> We are Sheluchim to judge only admissions and loans, for these are frequent.</p>
<p class="bas subject"><span class="nm">5)</span>RUMORS OF <i>KIDUSHIN</i></p>
<p class="bas indent1"><span class="nm">(a)</span><span class="cl">(Mishnah):</span> If there are rumors in the city that Leah was Mekudeshes, we consider her to be Mekudeshes;</p>
<p class="bas indent1"><span class="nm">(b)</span>If there are rumors in the city that she was divorced, we consider her to be divorced;</p>
<p class="bas indent2"><span class="nm">1.</span>This is only if there is no excuse (a way to discredit the rumors).</p>
<p class="bas indent2"><span class="nm">2.</span>Examples of excuses are if Leah was divorced on condition, or Kidushin money was thrown to her, and we were in doubt if it landed closer to her or to him. These are excuses (why there are rumors. In truth, perhaps the divorce or Kidushin was found to be invalid!)</p>
<p class="bas indent1"><span class="nm">(c)</span><span class="cl">(Gemara) Question:</span> (If there are rumors that a Kohen divorced his wife,) do we really forbid her to him?!</p>
<p class="bas indent2"><span class="nm">1.</span><span class="cl">(Rav Ashi):</span> We are not concerned for any rumors that started after Nisu'in.</p>
<p class="bas indent1"><span class="nm">(d)</span><span class="cl">Answer:</span> The Mishnah means that if there are rumors in the city that Leah was Mekudeshes, we consider her to be Mekudeshes. If there are rumors that she was Mekudeshes and divorced, we consider her to be Mekudeshes and divorced. (I.e. the rumors came at the time of Kidushin, before Nisu'in).</p>
<p class="bas indent1"><span class="nm">(e)</span><span class="cl">Question:</span> Why can we rely on rumors (that she was divorced) to permit her?</p>
<p class="bas indent1"><span class="nm">(f)</span><span class="cl">Answer:</span> These rumors break the rumors that she was Mekudeshes.</p>
