<p class="bas subject"><span class="nm">1)</span>MUST THE DAMAGER DISTANCE HIMSELF?</p>
<p class="bas indent1"><span class="nm">(a)</span><span class="cl">(Mishnah):</span> A laundry ditch ...</p>
<p class="bas indent1"><span class="nm">(b)</span><span class="cl">Version #1 (Rav Nachman):</span> Three Tefachim suffice only for the ditch in which the laundry is soaked. The ditch in which one rubs the clothes must be distanced four Amos.</p>
<p class="bas indent2"><span class="nm">1.</span><span class="cl">Support (Beraisa):</span> A laundry ditch must be distanced four Amos.</p>
<p class="bas indent2"><span class="nm">2.</span><span class="cl">Contradiction (Mishnah):</span> It must be distanced three Tefachim.</p>
<p class="bas indent2"><span class="nm">3.</span><span class="cl">Answer:</span> The Mishnah and Beraisa discuss different types of laundry ditches, like Rav Nachman taught.</p>
<p class="bas indent1"><span class="nm">(c)</span><span class="cl">Version #2 - Question:</span> The Mishnah says that a laundry ditch must be distanced three Tefachim;</p>
<p class="bas indent2"><span class="nm">1.</span><span class="cl">Contradiction (Beraisa):</span> A laundry ditch must be distanced four Amos.</p>
<p class="bas indent1"><span class="nm">(d)</span><span class="cl">Answer (Rav Nachman):</span> Three Tefachim suffices for the ditch in which the laundry is soaked. The ditch in which one rubs the clothes must be distanced four Amos. (end of Version #2)</p>
<p class="bas indent1"><span class="nm">(e)</span><span class="cl">(R. Chiya, son of Rav Avya):</span> The text of the Mishnah explicitly says that he must distance the edge of the soaking ditch three Tefachim from the wall.</p>
<p class="bas indent1"><span class="nm">(f)</span><span class="cl">(Mishnah):</span> V'Sad (and he plasters the wall of the pit).</p>
<p class="bas indent1"><span class="nm">(g)</span><span class="cl">Question:</span> Does this mean '<i>and</i> he plasters', or '<i>or</i> he plasters'?</p>
<p class="bas indent1"><span class="nm">(h)</span><span class="cl">Answer #1:</span> Clearly, it must be 'and'. If not, the Reisha (one who digs a pit, irrigation channel... must distance v'Sad) would have been taught together with the Seifa (one must distance the refuse of olives, manure... or apply plaster)! (Tosfos 17a - the text in both clauses must be v'Sad. If not, surely the Tana said v'Sad only in the Reisha, for only in the Reisha both (distance and plaster) are required! The Gemara knows that the damagers in the Seifa are not so potent to require both.)</p>
<p class="bas indent1"><span class="nm">(i)</span><span class="cl">Rejection:</span> Even though also in the Reisha, either suffices, the Tana teaches separately damage from water, and damage from heat.</p>
<p class="bas indent1"><span class="nm">(j)</span><span class="cl">Answer #2 (Beraisa - R. Yehudah):</span> In land in which the dirt is brittle, each neighbor may dig (a pit) in his own property, but must distance himself three Tefachim and plaster it.</p>
<p class="bas indent2"><span class="nm">1.</span><span class="cl">Inference:</span> He must distance and plaster only because the dirt is brittle!</p>
<p class="bas indent1"><span class="nm">(k)</span><span class="cl">Rejection:</span> No. Even if the dirt is not brittle, he must distance and plaster.</p>
<p class="bas indent2"><span class="nm">1.</span>The Beraisa taught the case of brittle dirt, for one might have thought that more than three Tefachim are required. It teaches that this is not so.</p>
<p class="bas subject"><span class="nm">2)</span>DAMAGE DUE TO HEAT</p>
<p class="bas indent1"><span class="nm">(a)</span><span class="cl">(Mishnah):</span> One must distance the refuse of olives, manure, salt, lime, and rocks ...</p>
<p class="bas indent1"><span class="nm">(b)</span><span class="cl">(Mishnah):</span> We may not do Hatmanah (wrap food to keep it warm on Shabbos) in refuse of olives, manure, salt, lime, or sand, whether they are wet or dry.</p>
<p class="bas indent1"><span class="nm">(c)</span><span class="cl">Question:</span> Why does our Mishnah teach about rocks but not about sand, and the other Mishnah teaches about sand, but not about rocks?</p>
<p class="bas indent1"><span class="nm">(d)</span><span class="cl">Answer #1 (Rav Yosef):</span> The Mishnah of Hatmanah does not teach about rocks, for people do not normally do Hatmanah in rocks.</p>
<p class="bas indent1"><span class="nm">(e)</span><span class="cl">Objection (Abaye):</span> It is not normal to do Hatmanah in tufts of wool, or strips of purple wool, but a Beraisa teaches these!</p>
<p class="bas indent2"><span class="nm">1.</span><span class="cl">(Beraisa):</span> We may do Hatmanah in tufts of wool, or pieces of combed wool, or in strips of purple wool, and in soft wads, but we may not move them (on Shabbos).</p>
<p class="bas indent1"><span class="nm">(f)</span><span class="cl">Answer #2 (Abaye):</span> The two Mishnayos reveal about each other.</p>
<p class="bas indent2"><span class="nm">1.</span>Our Mishnah teaches about rocks. The same law applies to sand;</p>
<p class="bas indent2"><span class="nm">2.</span>That Mishnah teaches about sand. The same law applies to rocks.</p>
<p class="bas indent1"><span class="nm">(g)</span><span class="cl">Objection (Rava):</span> If so, why were the other things listed in both Mishnayos? Each should have been taught only in one, and we would know that it applies to the other, also!</p>
<p class="bas indent1"><span class="nm">(h)</span><span class="cl">Answer #3 (Rava):</span> That Mishnah does not teach about rocks for they would make the pots rust or break (so they are never used for Hatmanah).</p>
<p class="bas indent2"><span class="nm">1.</span>Sand is not taught in our Mishnah, for it heats only what is hot, but cools what is cold. (Therefore, it does not harm walls, which are cold.)</p>
<p class="bas indent1"><span class="nm">(i)</span><span class="cl">Objection:</span> R. Oshiya taught that sand must be distanced from a wall!</p>
<p class="bas indent1"><span class="nm">(j)</span><span class="cl">Answer:</span> That refers to wet sand.</p>
<p class="bas indent1"><span class="nm">(k)</span><span class="cl">Question:</span> Our Tana should teach the case of wet sand!</p>
<p class="bas indent1"><span class="nm">(l)</span><span class="cl">Answer:</span> He already taught the case of an irrigation channel (which damages like wet sand).</p>
<p class="bas indent1"><span class="nm">(m)</span><span class="cl">Question:</span> He taught both an irrigation channel and a laundry ditch!</p>
<p class="bas indent1"><span class="nm">(n)</span><span class="cl">Answer:</span> It was necessary to teach both of those.</p>
<p class="bas indent2"><span class="nm">1.</span>Had he taught only an irrigation channel, one might have thought that this is because it is constantly used, but a laundry ditch need not be distanced!</p>
<p class="bas indent2"><span class="nm">2.</span>If only a laundry ditch was taught one might have thought that this is because its water is stagnant (and damages more), but an irrigation channel need not be distanced!</p>
<p class="bas subject"><span class="nm">3)</span>DAMAGE DUE TO VEGETATION</p>
<p class="bas indent1"><span class="nm">(a)</span><span class="cl">(Mishnah):</span> He cannot plant seeds or plow (unless he distances ...).</p>
<p class="bas indent1"><span class="nm">(b)</span><span class="cl">Question:</span> The Mishnah obligates distancing plowing. Why must it also teach that he must distance his plants?</p>
<p class="bas indent1"><span class="nm">(c)</span><span class="cl">Answer:</span> One can sow seeds by hand, without plowing.</p>
<p class="bas indent1"><span class="nm">(d)</span><span class="cl">Question:</span> The Mishnah obligates distancing seeds. Why must it also teach that he must distance his plowing? (Things grow only where he seeds!)</p>
<p class="bas indent1"><span class="nm">(e)</span><span class="cl">Answer:</span> He may want to plow to improve his trees (which were properly planted long ago).</p>
<p class="bas indent1"><span class="nm">(f)</span><span class="cl">Question:</span> Why must the Mishnah teach that he must distance his plants? We know that he cannot bring water close to the wall!</p>
<p class="bas indent1"><span class="nm">(g)</span><span class="cl">Answer:</span> The Tana is in Eretz Yisrael, where the rain suffices for the plants.</p>
<p class="bas bbbline">19b----------------------------------------19b</p>
<p class="bas indent1"><span class="nm">(h)</span><span class="cl">Suggestion:</span> He must distance plants because roots do not grow straight down, rather to the sides.</p>
<p class="bas indent1"><span class="nm">(i)</span><span class="cl">Question (Mishnah):</span> If one plants the top of a growing vine into the ground, if it is less than three Tefachim deep, he may not plants seeds on top of it (because the area is considered a vineyard);</p>
<p class="bas indent2"><span class="nm">1.</span><span class="cl">(Beraisa):</span> He may plant seeds to the sides.</p>
<p class="bas indent1"><span class="nm">(j)</span><span class="cl">Answer:</span> (Really, the roots grow straight down.) Plants must be distanced because they cause the surrounding dirt to soften.</p>
<p class="bas indent1"><span class="nm">(k)</span><span class="cl">(Mishnah):</span> He must distance urine three Tefachim from his neighbor's wall...</p>
<p class="bas indent1"><span class="nm">(l)</span><span class="cl">(Rabah bar bar Chanah):</span> One may urinate near his neighbor's wall. It says "I will cut off (from the seed of Achav) one that urinates at the wall ..."</p>
<p class="bas indent1"><span class="nm">(m)</span><span class="cl">Question:</span> Our Mishnah forbids urinating within three Tefachim of his neighbor's wall!</p>
<p class="bas indent1"><span class="nm">(n)</span><span class="cl">Answer:</span> No, the Mishnah prohibits pouring out urine near the wall.</p>
<p class="bas indent1"><span class="nm">(o)</span><span class="cl">(Beraisa):</span> One may not urinate within three Tefachim of his neighbor's wall, i.e. a brick wall;</p>
<p class="bas indent2"><span class="nm">1.</span>Regarding a stone wall, it suffices to distance one Tefach, for this will not harm the wall;</p>
<p class="bas indent2"><span class="nm">2.</span>If the stone wall is built on a rock, one need not distance himself at all.</p>
<p class="bas indent1"><span class="nm">(p)</span>Rabah bar bar Chanah is refuted.</p>
<p class="bas indent1"><span class="nm">(q)</span><span class="cl">Question:</span> He brought a verse as support!</p>
<p class="bas indent1"><span class="nm">(r)</span><span class="cl">Answer:</span> The prophecy was that there will not remain to Achav's house even what normally urinates at the wall, namely, a dog.</p>
<p class="bas subject"><span class="nm">4)</span>BARRIERS THAT SHIELD FROM TUM'AH</p>
<p class="bas indent1"><span class="nm">(a)</span>(We know that Tum'ah passes from one room to another if the wall between them has an opening of a square Tefach.)</p>
<p class="bas indent1"><span class="nm">(b)</span><span class="cl">(Shmuel):</span> When measuring the size of the opening, if there is a thin wafer in the hole there, the space it occupies is considered part of the opening.</p>
<p class="bas indent1"><span class="nm">(c)</span><span class="cl">Question:</span> Even a thick loaf does not diminish the gap!</p>
<p class="bas indent1"><span class="nm">(d)</span><span class="cl">Answer:</span> He teaches a bigger Chidush.</p>
<p class="bas indent2"><span class="nm">1.</span>A loaf does not diminish it, since he may want to eat it, so he is not Mevatel it (leave it to be part of the wall);</p>
<p class="bas indent2"><span class="nm">2.</span>One might have thought that he is Mevatel a wafer (which gets ruined quickly, so it diminishes the gap). He teaches that this is not so.</p>
<p class="bas indent1"><span class="nm">(e)</span><span class="cl">Question:</span> We already know that it cannot shield from Tum'ah, since it itself can become Tamei!</p>
<p class="bas indent1"><span class="nm">(f)</span><span class="cl">Answer:</span> The wafer was kneaded with fruit juice (none of the seven liquids that enable food to receive Tum'ah ever touched the flour, so the wafer cannot become Tamei).</p>
<p class="bas indent1"><span class="nm">(g)</span><span class="cl">Question (Mishnah):</span> If a box full of straw or a jug full of dried figs is in a window, and the straw or figs could stand there even if the box or jug was removed, the straw or figs block Tum'ah from passing through the opening. If they cannot stand by themselves, they do not block Tum'ah.</p>
<p class="bas indent2"><span class="nm">1.</span>Even though straw is fit for an animal (to eat, so he will not be Mevatel it), it blocks Tum'ah!</p>
<p class="bas indent1"><span class="nm">(h)</span><span class="cl">Answer:</span> The case is, the straw is spoiled.</p>
<p class="bas indent2"><span class="nm">1.</span><span class="cl">Question:</span> Still, it is fit for making mud!</p>
<p class="bas indent2"><span class="nm">2.</span><span class="cl">Answer:</span> The case is, there are thorns in it (so it is not fitting).</p>
<p class="bas indent2"><span class="nm">3.</span><span class="cl">Question:</span> It is fitting to burn!</p>
<p class="bas indent2"><span class="nm">4.</span><span class="cl">Answer:</span> The Mishnah discusses wet straw.</p>
<p class="bas indent2"><span class="nm">5.</span><span class="cl">Question:</span> It is fitting to burn in a big fire!</p>
<p class="bas indent2"><span class="nm">6.</span><span class="cl">Answer:</span> Big fires are uncommon (so he is Mevatel it).</p>
<p class="bas indent1"><span class="nm">(i)</span><span class="cl">Question:</span> Even though dried figs are fit to eat, they block Tum'ah!</p>
<p class="bas indent1"><span class="nm">(j)</span><span class="cl">Answer (Shmuel and Rabah bar Avuha):</span> The case is, they are wormy.</p>
