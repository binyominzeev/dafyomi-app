<p class="bas subject"><span class="nm">1)</span>YO'AV</p>
<p class="bas indent1"><span class="nm">(a)</span>They brought Yo'av for judgment. They asked 'why did you kill Avner'?</p>
<p class="bas indent2"><span class="nm">1.</span><span class="cl">Yo'av:</span> I was Go'el ha'Dam for my brother Asa'el.</p>
<p class="bas indent2"><span class="nm">2.</span><span class="cl">The Sanhedrin:</span> He was pursuing Avner to kill him. Avner was allowed to kill him (so the law of Go'el ha'Dam does not apply)!</p>
<p class="bas indent2"><span class="nm">3.</span><span class="cl">Yo'av:</span> Avner was forbidden to kill him, for he could have stopped Asa'el by destroying one of his limbs, without killing him.</p>
<p class="bas indent2"><span class="nm">4.</span><span class="cl">The Sanhedrin:</span> He was unable to do so.</p>
<p class="bas indent2"><span class="nm">5.</span><span class="cl">Yo'av:</span> "Va'Yakehu...El ha'Chomesh" - he was able to (aim for and) strike the fifth rib. All the more so he could have struck a limb that would not kill him!</p>
<p class="bas indent3"><span class="nm">i.</span><span class="cl">(R. Yochanan):</span> The gall bladder and liver are attached to the fifth rib.</p>
<p class="bas indent2"><span class="nm">6.</span><span class="cl">The Sanhedrin:</span> Indeed, we exempt you for killing Avner. Why did you kill Amasa?</p>
<p class="bas indent2"><span class="nm">7.</span><span class="cl">Yo'av:</span> He was Mored b'Malchus - "va'Yelech Amasa... va'Yocher" (he delayed fulfilling David's request to gather Yehudah).</p>
<p class="bas indent2"><span class="nm">8.</span><span class="cl">The Sanhedrin:</span> This was not rebellious. Amasa expounded 'Ach' and 'Rak' to exclude:</p>
<p class="bas indent3"><span class="nm">i.</span>"Kol Asher Yamreh Es Picha... Rak Chazak ve'Ematz" excludes a command of the king contrary to Torah (one must not obey it);</p>
<p class="bas indent3"><span class="nm">ii.</span>When Amasa went to gather Yehudah, they were learning, therefore he waited until they finished.</p>
<p class="bas indent2"><span class="nm">9.</span><span class="cl">The Sanhedrin:</span> Rather, you were Mored (against David, through supporting Adoniyahu's rebellion) - "Yo'av Nota Acharei Adoniyahu v'Acharei Avshalom Lo Nota."</p>
<p class="bas indent1"><span class="nm">(b)</span><span class="cl">Questions:</span> Why does it mention that Yo'av had not supported Avshalom's rebellion, and why didn't he?</p>
<p class="bas indent1"><span class="nm">(c)</span><span class="cl">Answer #1 (R. Elazar):</span> He thought to support Avshalom. He did not, for David still had some of his strength.</p>
<p class="bas indent1"><span class="nm">(d)</span><span class="cl">Answer #2 (R. Yosi b'Rebbi Chanina):</span> David's strong-arms were still around.</p>
<p class="bas indent1"><span class="nm">(e)</span><span class="cl">(Rav Yehudah):</span> David had 400 children from Yefos To'ar (attractive women taken in war);</p>
<p class="bas indent2"><span class="nm">1.</span>They grew Bluris (long hair in back), and sat in gold wagons at the head of the troops. They were the strong-arms of Beis David (to scare the enemy).</p>
<p class="bas indent1"><span class="nm">(f)</span>R. Aba bar Kahana argues with Rav Yehudah.</p>
<p class="bas indent2"><span class="nm">1.</span><span class="cl">(R. Aba bar Kahana):</span> If not for the merit of David's Torah, Yo'av would not have succeeded in war; if not for Yo'av's success in war, David could not have engaged in Torah;</p>
<p class="bas indent2"><span class="nm">2.</span>We learn from "David Oseh Mishpat u'Tzedakah... v'Yo'av ben Tzeruyah Al ha'Tzeva" - each was dependant on the other.</p>
<p class="bas indent1"><span class="nm">(g)</span><span class="cl">Question:</span> "Yo'av... va'Yishlach Mal'achim Acharei Avner va'Yashivu Oso <i>mi'Bor ha'Sirah.</i>" What is this?</p>
<p class="bas indent1"><span class="nm">(h)</span><span class="cl">Answer (R. Aba bar Kahana):</span> A pit and a thorn caused Avner's death. (David had an opportunity to kill Sha'ul. Instead, he took the flask near Sha'ul and (on another such occasion) cut Sha'ul's garment. This should have proven to Sha'ul that David did not want to kill him, but Avner said that perhaps a servant took the flask to bring water from a pit, and perhaps the garment was torn on a thorn.)</p>
<p class="bas indent1"><span class="nm">(i)</span><span class="cl">(R. Yochanan):</span> "Va'Yatehu Yo'av El Toch ha'Sha'ar" - Yo'av judged Avner like a Sanhedrin. ('Sha'ar' normally refers to a Sanhedrin.)</p>
<p class="bas indent2"><span class="nm">1.</span><span class="cl">Yo'av:</span> Why did you kill Asa'el?</p>
<p class="bas indent2"><span class="nm">2.</span><span class="cl">Avner:</span> He was pursuing me!</p>
<p class="bas indent2"><span class="nm">3.</span><span class="cl">Yo'av:</span> You could have destroyed one of his limbs. You were forbidden to kill him!</p>
<p class="bas indent2"><span class="nm">4.</span><span class="cl">Avner:</span> I was unable to do so.</p>
<p class="bas indent2"><span class="nm">5.</span><span class="cl">Yo'av:</span> "Va'Yakehu... El ha'Chomesh" - you were able to strike the fifth rib, and all the more so you could have struck a limb that would not kill him!</p>
<p class="bas indent1"><span class="nm">(j)</span>"Ledaber Ito ba'Sheli" - he spoke with him about Shalu (removing. Yo'av asked how a woman without hands does Chalitzah (removes the Yavam's shoe.). Avner bent down to demonstrate (i.e. with her teeth). Yo'av drew his sword and killed him).</p>
<p class="bas indent1"><span class="nm">(k)</span><span class="cl">(R. Yochanan):</span> "Va'Yakehu (Yo'av struck Avner) Sham ha'Chomesh" - the gall bladder and liver are attached to the fifth rib.</p>
<p class="bas indent1"><span class="nm">(l)</span>"Asher Paga bi'Shnei Anashim Tzadikim v'Tovim Mimenu" - Amasa and Avner were better than Yo'av. They expounded 'Ach' and 'Rak' to exclude a command of the king contrary to Torah (Amasa did not interrupt people learning, and Avner refused to kill the Kohanim or Nov), but Yo'av did not (he killed Uriyah).</p>
<p class="bas indent2"><span class="nm">1.</span>They were bigger Tzadikim. They refused to fulfill a verbal command of the king (contrary to Torah), but Yo'av fulfilled what he was commanded in a letter.</p>
<p class="bas indent1"><span class="nm">(m)</span><span class="cl">(Rav):</span> "Va'Amasa Lo Nishmar ba'Cherev Asher b'Yad Yo'av" - he did not suspect that he wanted to kill him.</p>
<p class="bas indent1"><span class="nm">(n)</span><span class="cl">Question:</span> "Ya'Yikaver (Yo'av) b'Veiso ba'Midbar." Was his house a wilderness?!</p>
<p class="bas indent1"><span class="nm">(o)</span><span class="cl">Answer #1 (Rav Yehudah):</span> It was like a wilderness. Just like a wilderness is Hefker to all, Yo'av's house was open for the needs of the poor.</p>
<p class="bas indent1"><span class="nm">(p)</span><span class="cl">Answer #2:</span> Just like a wilderness is free of theft and incest, also Yo'av's house.</p>
<p class="bas indent1"><span class="nm">(q)</span><span class="cl">(Rav Yehudah):</span> "V'Yo'av Yechayeh Es She'ar ha'Ir" - he would share with the poor the very fish (delicacies) that he ate.</p>

<p class="perekline">PEREK ARBA MISOS</p>
<p class="bas subject"><span class="nm">2)</span>PLACES WHERE THE ORDER IS IMPORTANT</p>
<p class="bas indent1"><span class="nm">(a)</span><span class="cl">(Mishnah):</span> Beis Din administers four death penalties: stoning, burning, beheading (by a sword), and choking;</p>
<p class="bas indent1"><span class="nm">(b)</span>R. Shimon says, the order (from most severe to least severe) is burning, stoning, choking, beheading.</p>
<p class="bas indent1"><span class="nm">(c)</span><span class="cl">(Gemara - Rava):</span> There is only one place where Chachamim listed things and the order is important - the seven ingredients:</p>
<p class="bas indent2"><span class="nm">1.</span><span class="cl">(Mishnah):</span> We apply seven ingredients to test a stain (to determine whether or not it is from menstrual blood) - saliva (of one who has not eaten all day), chewed beans, urine (that putrefied), nitre, Boris (plant leaves used for cleaning), Kimolya (a white sand used for laundering) and Ashlag (an herb used to clean hands).</p>
<p class="bas indent2"><span class="nm">2.</span>If they were not applied in this order, or they were applied all at once, one may not rely on them.</p>
<p class="bas indent1"><span class="nm">(d)</span><span class="cl">(Rav Papa Sava):</span> Also in our Mishnah the order is important;</p>
<p class="bas indent2"><span class="nm">1.</span>Since R. Shimon argues, this shows that the first Tana also cares about the order!</p>
<p class="bas indent2"><span class="nm">2.</span>Rava did not discuss matters about which there is an argument, so he did not count our Mishnah.</p>
<p class="bas indent1"><span class="nm">(e)</span><span class="cl">(Rav Papa):</span> Also regarding the Avodah of Yom Kipur the order is important!</p>
<p class="bas indent2"><span class="nm">1.</span><span class="cl">(Mishnah):</span> Every Avodah of Yom Kipur given in order, if it was done out of order, it is invalid.</p>
<p class="bas indent2"><span class="nm">2.</span>Rava only discussed matters in which there is an order of importance;</p>
<p class="bas indent3"><span class="nm">i.</span>It is a mere stringency that Avodah of Yom Kipur done out of order is invalid.</p>
<p class="bas indent1"><span class="nm">(f)</span><span class="cl">(Rav Huna brei d'Rav Yehoshua):</span> Also the order of the Tamid offerings is importantl</p>
<p class="bas indent2"><span class="nm">1.</span><span class="cl">(Mishnah):</span> This is the order of the Tamid.</p>
<p class="bas indent2"><span class="nm">2.</span>Rav Papa did not add this because the order is only l'Chatchilah.</p>
<p class="bas indent1"><span class="nm">(g)</span>Rava intended to exclude Chalitzah.</p>
<p class="bas indent2"><span class="nm">1.</span><span class="cl">(Mishnah):</span> The Mitzvah of Chalitzah: the Yevamah and Yavam come in front of Beis Din. They give to him a proper counsel - "v'Kor'u Lo Ziknei Iro";</p>
<p class="bas indent2"><span class="nm">2.</span>She says "Me'en Yevami..." He says "Lo Chafatzti Lekachta." Both are in Lashon ha'Kodesh;</p>
<p class="bas indent2"><span class="nm">3.</span>"L'Einei ha'Zekenim (v'Choltzah Na'alo) v'Yorkah Befanav" - the judges must be able to see her spit.</p>
<p class="bas indent2"><span class="nm">4.</span><span class="cl">(Rav Yehudah):</span> "V'Onsah v'Omrah" - the Mitzvah is that first she recites (the verses), then he does, then she removes his shoe, spits, and she recites;</p>
<p class="bas indent2"><span class="nm">5.</span><span class="cl">Question:</span> What is his Chidush? A Mishnah teaches this!</p>
<p class="bas indent2"><span class="nm">6.</span><span class="cl">Answer:</span> He teaches that this is only l'Chatchilah, but if the order was changed, it does not make a difference.</p>
<p class="bas indent2"><span class="nm">7.</span><span class="cl">Support (Beraisa):</span> Whether she removed his shoe and then spit, or spit beforehand, the Chalitzah is Kesherah.</p>
<p class="bas indent1"><span class="nm">(h)</span>Rava also excludes the Mishnah of Bigdei Kehunah.</p>
<p class="bas indent2"><span class="nm">1.</span>A Kohen Gadol serves with eight garments, and a regular Kohen with four: Kesones (a tunic), pants, hat, and a belt.</p>
<p class="bas indent2"><span class="nm">2.</span><span class="cl">The Kohen Gadol wears these and four more:</span> the Choshen (on his chest), Efod (like an apron), Me'il (coat), and Tzitz (plate on the forehead).</p>
<p class="bas indent2"><span class="nm">3.</span><span class="cl">(Beraisa):</span> He should wear the pants first - "u'Michnesei Vad Yihyeh Al Besaro."</p>
<p class="bas indent2"><span class="nm">4.</span>The Tana of the Mishnah listed the Kesones first, because the Torah lists it first.</p>
<p class="bas indent2"><span class="nm">5.</span><span class="cl">Question:</span> Why does the Torah list it first?</p>
<p class="bas indent2"><span class="nm">6.</span><span class="cl">Answer:</span> Because it covers the entire body, it is more important.</p>
<p class="bas subject"><span class="nm">3)</span>HOW CHACHAMIM LEARN THE ORDER OF SEVERITY OF THE FOUR MISOS</p>
<p class="bas indent1"><span class="nm">(a)</span><span class="cl">(Mishnah):</span> Stoning, burning...</p>
<p class="bas indent1"><span class="nm">(b)</span>Stoning is more severe than burning, for it is given to blasphemers and idolaters.</p>
<p class="bas indent2"><span class="nm">1.</span>Those are considered severe transgressions because they rebel against Hash-m; (the reasons for the severity of the transgressions remains the same in the entire discussion. We will not repeat them every time.)</p>
<p class="bas indent1"><span class="nm">(c)</span><span class="cl">Question:</span> Burning is more severe, for (a Na'arah Me'urasah Bas Yisrael is stoned for Zenus, but) a Bas Kohen who was Mezanah is burned!</p>
<p class="bas indent2"><span class="nm">1.</span>This is more severe (than Zenus of a Bas Yisrael), because she profanes her father!</p>
