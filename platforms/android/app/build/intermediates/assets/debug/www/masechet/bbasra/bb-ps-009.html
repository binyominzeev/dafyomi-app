<p class="dedicationbox">BAVA BASRA 9 - Dedicated for a speedy Refu'ah Sheleimah for Gittel bas Esther Chayah Reizel, by her nephew and family. </p>

<p class="bas subject"><span class="nm">1)</span>WHOM WE TRUST</p>
<p class="bas indent1"><span class="nm">(a)</span><span class="cl">(Rav Ashi):</span> I do not need to stipulate. Anyone who gives, he gives on condition that I will distribute it as I see fit.</p>
<p class="bas indent1"><span class="nm">(b)</span>Two slaughterers made a deal that if either works on the other's day, the skin of his animal will be torn. Reuven worked on Shimon's day, and Shimon tore the skin.</p>
<p class="bas indent2"><span class="nm">1.</span><span class="cl">Rava:</span> Shimon must pay.</p>
<p class="bas indent2"><span class="nm">2.</span><span class="cl">Rav Yemar bar Shalmiya:</span> The Beraisa says that people of the city may (fix...) and enforce this with fines!</p>
<p class="bas indent2"><span class="nm">3.</span>Rava did not answer.</p>
<p class="bas indent2"><span class="nm">4.</span><span class="cl">Rav Papa:</span> Rava justifiably did not answer. When there is a great person in the city, fines must be enacted in front of him.</p>
<p class="bas indent1"><span class="nm">(c)</span><span class="cl">(Beraisa):</span> We do not ask collectors of Tzedakah to give a calculation of what they collected and distributed, nor with overseers of Hekdesh;</p>
<p class="bas indent2"><span class="nm">1.</span>A hint (not a proof) of this is "v'Lo Yechashevu... ve'Emunah Hem Osim" (those who.built the Mikdash did not need to account for what they took).</p>
<p class="bas indent1"><span class="nm">(d)</span><span class="cl">(R. Elazar):</span> Even when giving money to a trustworthy person, one should wrap and count the money - "va'Yatzuru va'Yimnu."</p>
<p class="bas indent1"><span class="nm">(e)</span><span class="cl">(Rav Huna):</span> If one (claiming to be poor) requests food, we check if he is truly poor. If he requests clothing, we give before checking.</p>
<p class="bas indent2"><span class="nm">1.</span>We can learn from a verse or from reasoning.</p>
<p class="bas indent2"><span class="nm">2.</span>Reasoning - one without clothes is embarrassed. One lacking food is not.</p>
<p class="bas indent2"><span class="nm">3.</span>A verse - "Paros la'Ra'ev Lachmecha" is written with a 'Sin', it may be read 'Perosh' (clarify before giving). (Either we must say like Tosfos (Shabbos 55B) that the Gemara's text (of Yeshayah) differs from our text, or we must change the text of our Gemara - see Maharsha.)</p>
<p class="bas indent3"><span class="nm">i.</span>"...Ki Sir'eh Arum v'Chisiso" - as soon as you see a naked person, clothe him.</p>
<p class="bas indent1"><span class="nm">(f)</span><span class="cl">(Rav Yehudah):</span> We check before giving clothing, but not before giving food.</p>
<p class="bas indent2"><span class="nm">1.</span>We can learn from a verse or from reasoning.</p>
<p class="bas indent2"><span class="nm">2.</span>Reasoning - one without food is in pain. One lacking clothing is not.</p>
<p class="bas indent2"><span class="nm">3.</span>A verse - "Paros la'Ra'ev Lachmecha" - immediately;</p>
<p class="bas indent3"><span class="nm">i.</span>"...Ki Sir'eh Arum v'Chisiso" - after you see that he is truly poor.</p>
<p class="bas indent1"><span class="nm">(g)</span><span class="cl">Support (for Rav Yehudah - Beraisa):</span> If one requests clothing, we check if he is truly poor. If he requests food, we give before checking.</p>
<p class="bas subject"><span class="nm">2)</span>HOW MUCH WE GIVE TO THE POOR</p>
<p class="bas indent1"><span class="nm">(a)</span><span class="cl">(Mishnah):</span> If a poor person is traveling, we give to him at least a loaf bought for a Pundiyon when grain sells for four Sa'im for a Sela (i.e. the loaf is a quarter Kav, the volume of six eggs);</p>
<p class="bas indent1"><span class="nm">(b)</span>If he will spend the night, we give to him needs of lodging.</p>
<p class="bas indent2"><span class="nm">1.</span><span class="cl">(Rav Papa):</span> This is a bed and a pillow.</p>
<p class="bas indent1"><span class="nm">(c)</span>If he will stay over Shabbos, we give to him food for three meals.</p>
<p class="bas indent1"><span class="nm">(d)</span><span class="cl">(Beraisa):</span> If one begs from door to door, we do not give to him from the Kupah.</p>
<p class="bas indent1"><span class="nm">(e)</span>A poor person begging from door to door came to Rav Papa. He did not give to him.</p>
<p class="bas indent2"><span class="nm">1.</span><span class="cl">Rav Sama brei d'Rav Yeiva:</span> If you do not give to him, no one will, and he will die!</p>
<p class="bas indent2"><span class="nm">2.</span><span class="cl">Question:</span> The Beraisa says that we do not give to him!</p>
<p class="bas indent2"><span class="nm">3.</span><span class="cl">Answer:</span> We do not give to him a large amount, but we give a small amount.</p>
<p class="bas indent1"><span class="nm">(f)</span><span class="cl">(Rav Asi):</span> One should give at least a third of a Shekel to Tzedakah every year - "we established Mitzvos upon ourselves... Shlishis ha'Shekel b'Shanah (above the half-Shekel that the Torah requires) for the Mikdash." (Fifty Shekalim used to be a standard annual income.)</p>
<p class="bas indent1"><span class="nm">(g)</span><span class="cl">(Rav Asi):</span> Tzedakah is equated to all the Mitzvos - "v'Ha'amadnu Alenu Mitzvos (plural)."</p>
<p class="bas indent1"><span class="nm">(h)</span><span class="cl">(R. Elazar):</span> One who induces others to give is greater than one who gives himself - "v'Hayah Ma'ase ha'Tzedakah Shalom".</p>
<p class="bas indent2"><span class="nm">1.</span>If one merits (to have a good Mazel), "Paros la'Ra'ev Lachmecha" will apply to him;</p>
<p class="bas indent2"><span class="nm">2.</span>If not, "v'Aniyim Merudim Tavi Vayis" (the kingdom of Romi, which constantly demands money, will take his money).</p>
<p class="bas indent1"><span class="nm">(i)</span><span class="cl">Rava (to people of his city):</span> Do (Tzedakah) with each other in order that you will have Shalom with the king.</p>
<p class="bas indent1"><span class="nm">(j)</span><span class="cl">(R. Elazar):</span> When the Mikdash stood, a person gave a half Shekel, and this was an atonement for him;</p>
<p class="bas indent2"><span class="nm">1.</span>Now that there is no Mikdash, if one gives Tzedakah, this is good;</p>
<p class="bas indent2"><span class="nm">2.</span>If not, Nochrim will forcibly take his money.</p>
<p class="bas indent3"><span class="nm">i.</span>Even so, that is considered Tzedakah - "v'Nogesayich Tzedakah."</p>
<p class="bas bbbline">9b----------------------------------------9b</p>
<p class="bas indent1"><span class="nm">(k)</span><span class="cl">(Rav Sheshes (Rashi; Tosfos - Rav Achdevoy bar Ami), who perverted the ways of his mother (this will be explained)):</span> "Va'Yilbash Tzedakah ka'Shiryan" - just like little pieces of iron join to make a big armor, also every Perutah of Tzedakah joins to a great sum.</p>
<p class="bas indent1"><span class="nm">(l)</span><span class="cl">(R. Chanina):</span> We learn this from "uch'Veged Idim Kol Tzidkoseinu" - just like every thread joins to make a big garment, also every Perutah of Tzedakah joins to a great sum.</p>
<p class="bas subject"><span class="nm">3)</span>HOW A METZORA IS METAMEI PEOPLE</p>
<p class="bas indent1"><span class="nm">(a)</span><span class="cl">Question:</span> How did Rav Sheshes (Tosfos - Rav Achdevoy) pervert the ways of his mother?</p>
<p class="bas indent1"><span class="nm">(b)</span><span class="cl">Answer:</span> He forced her to act immodestly in the following episode.</p>
<p class="bas indent2"><span class="nm">1.</span><span class="cl">Question (Rav Achdevoy bar Ami):</span> What is the source that a Metzora during the seven days of counting (after bringing birds, until he shaves again) is Metamei people?</p>
<p class="bas indent2"><span class="nm">2.</span><span class="cl">Answer (Rav Sheshes):</span> Since he makes clothing Tamei, he makes people Tamei.</p>
<p class="bas indent2"><span class="nm">3.</span><span class="cl">Question (Rav Achdevoy bar Ami):</span> Perhaps he is Metamei only what he wears, but not other clothing or people;</p>
<p class="bas indent3"><span class="nm">i.</span>One who moves a Neveilah is Metamei what he wears, but not other clothing or people!</p>
<p class="bas indent3"><span class="nm">ii.</span><span class="cl">Counter-question (Rav Sheshes):</span> What is our source that a rodent is Metamei people, if not that it is Metamei clothing?</p>
<p class="bas indent3"><span class="nm">iii.</span><span class="cl">Answer (Rav Achdevoy bar Ami):</span> It says explicitly about rodents "Ish Asher Yiga b'Chol Sheretz"!</p>
<p class="bas indent3"><span class="nm">iv.</span><span class="cl">Correction - Counter-question (Rav Sheshes):</span> Rather, what is our source that semen is Metamei people, if not that it is Metamei clothing?</p>
<p class="bas indent3"><span class="nm">v.</span><span class="cl">Answer (Rav Achdevoy):</span> Also about semen, it says "O Ish", to include one who touches!</p>
<p class="bas indent3"><span class="nm">vi.</span>Rav Achdevoy answered jovially. Rav Sheshes was very hurt, and Rav Achdevoy became mute and forgot his learning. Rav Sheshes' (Tosfos - his) mother begged Rav Sheshes to pray for him; he refused, until she said 'see these breasts that you nursed from (and have mercy on Rav Achdevoy)!'</p>
<p class="bas indent3"><span class="nm">vii.</span>Rav Sheshes prayed for him, and he recovered.</p>
<p class="bas indent2"><span class="nm">4.</span><span class="cl">Question:</span> We still did not hear the source that a Metzora during the days of counting is Metamei people!</p>
<p class="bas indent2"><span class="nm">5.</span><span class="cl">Answer (Beraisa - R. Shimon):</span> It says that a Metzora must wash (immerse) his clothes during the days of counting, and during the days he is Muchlat (absolutely Tamei);</p>
<p class="bas indent3"><span class="nm">i.</span>Just like he is Metamei people when he is Muchlat, also during the days of counting.</p>
<p class="bas subject"><span class="nm">4)</span>THE REWARD OF TZEDAKAH</p>
<p class="bas indent1"><span class="nm">(a)</span><span class="cl">(R. Elazar ha'Gadol):</span> A covert gift of Tzedakah suppresses damaging angels of anger more than the prayer of Moshe Rabeinu!</p>
<p class="bas indent2"><span class="nm">1.</span>Moshe said "Ki Yagorti Mipnei ha'Af veha'Chemah" (he feared them). It says about Tzedakah given covertly "Matan ba'Seser Yichpeh Af v'Shochad ba'Cheik Chemah Azah" (it covers them).</p>
<p class="bas indent1"><span class="nm">(b)</span><span class="cl">Version #1:</span> R. Yitzchak disagrees.</p>
<p class="bas indent2"><span class="nm">1.</span><span class="cl">(R. Yitzchak):</span> Covert Tzedakah suppresses Af, but not Chemah - "v'Shochad ba'Cheik Chemah Azah";</p>
<p class="bas indent3"><span class="nm">i.</span>Even though he gives Tzedakah covertly, there is still Chemah.</p>
<p class="bas indent1"><span class="nm">(c)</span><span class="cl">Version #2 - (R. Yitzchak):</span> Any judge who takes bribery brings harsh Chemah to the world - "V'Shochad ba'Cheik Chemah Azah". (End of Version #2)</p>
<p class="bas indent1"><span class="nm">(d)</span><span class="cl">(R. Yitzchak):</span> One who gives a Perutah to a poor person gets six blessings. One who comforts him with kind words gets 11 blessings.</p>
<p class="bas indent2"><span class="nm">1.</span>One who gives ("Paros la'Ra'ev Lachmecha") is rewarded "Yibaka... (he will succeed greatly, he will be healed speedily, his Tzedakah will bring him to Gan Eden, Hash-m's glory will gather him, Hash-m will answer his cry, and Hash-m will do his will);</p>
<p class="bas indent2"><span class="nm">2.</span>One who comforts him with words ("v'Safek la'Ra'ev Nafshecha") is rewarded "v'Zorach..." (his success will shine, he will be saved from afflictions, Hash-m will always guide him on the good path, he will not suffer hunger or thirst, his bones will be healthy, he will be satiated like a garden that is always moist, and like an unceasing spring, his deeds will build the ruins of the world, and restore the fallen foundations, and he will be called the one who fenced the breach, and returned people to Torah).</p>
<p class="bas indent1"><span class="nm">(e)</span><span class="cl">(R. Yitzchak) Question:</span> Because one is "Rodef Tzedakah v'Chesed, he will (need and) find... Tzedakah"?</p>
<p class="bas indent1"><span class="nm">(f)</span><span class="cl">Answer #1 (R. Yitzchak):</span> Rather, anyone who pursues to do Tzedakah, Hash-m will enable him to give Tzedakah.</p>
<p class="bas indent1"><span class="nm">(g)</span><span class="cl">Answer #2 (Rav Nachman bar Yitzchak):</span> Hash-m will present to him fitting recipients of Tzedakah, so he will get reward.</p>
<p class="bas indent2"><span class="nm">1.</span>This excludes the case that Rabah taught about.</p>
<p class="bas indent1"><span class="nm">(h)</span><span class="cl">(Rabah):</span> "Va'Yihyu Muchshalim Lefanecha" - Yirmeyah asked that even when (the people who wanted to kill him) try to do Tzedakah, Hash-m should present to them unworthy recipients, so they will get no reward.</p>
