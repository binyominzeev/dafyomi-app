<p class="bas subject"><span class="nm">1)</span>WHY ARE DICEPLAYERS DISQUALIFIED?</p>
<p class="bas indent1"><span class="nm">(a)</span><span class="cl">(Mishnah - R. Yehudah):</span> When is this? It is when they have no other profession. If they have another profession, they are Kesherim.</p>
<p class="bas indent1"><span class="nm">(b)</span><span class="cl">Question:</span> This shows that the reason is because they do not contribute to society. This refutes Rami bar Chama!</p>
<p class="bas indent2"><span class="nm">1.</span><span class="cl">Suggestion:</span> Chachamim argue with R. Yehudah, and they disqualify because it is Asmachta.</p>
<p class="bas indent2"><span class="nm">2.</span><span class="cl">Rejection:</span> R. Yehoshua ben Levi taught that whenever R. Yehudah says (in a Mishnah) 'when is this?' or 'what is the case?', he does not argue, he rather explains the first Tana;</p>
<p class="bas indent3"><span class="nm">i.</span><span class="cl">(R. Yochanan):</span> When R. Yehudah says 'when is this?', he explains. When he says 'what is the case?', he argues.</p>
<p class="bas indent1"><span class="nm">(c)</span><span class="cl">Answer:</span> Rami bar Chama is an Amora, just like R. Yehoshua ben Levi and R. Yochanan. He argues with them. He holds that 'when is this?' shows that R. Yehudah argues with the first Tana.</p>
<p class="bas indent1"><span class="nm">(d)</span><span class="cl">Question:</span> Surely, all agree that R. Yehudah argues with Chachamim!</p>
<p class="bas indent2"><span class="nm">1.</span><span class="cl">(Beraisa):</span> Whether or not he has a profession, he is disqualified. (This must be like Chachamim!)</p>
<p class="bas indent1"><span class="nm">(e)</span><span class="cl">Answer:</span> Really, the Beraisa is like R. Yehudah in the name of R. Tarfon.</p>
<p class="bas indent2"><span class="nm">1.</span><span class="cl">(Beraisa - R. Yehudah citing R. Tarfon):</span> (Reuven said 'I accept Nezirus if Ploni is a Nazir, and Shimon said 'I accept Nezirus if Ploni is not a Nazir.' . In any case, neither Reuven nor Shimon is a Nazir, because (acceptance of) Nezirus requires Hafla'ah (certainty. Likewise, betting is Asmachta, so it is not a Kinyan.)</p>
<p class="bas subject"><span class="nm">2)</span>THOSE WHO LEND WITH <i>RIBIS</i></p>
<p class="bas indent1"><span class="nm">(a)</span><span class="cl">(Mishnah):</span> Those who lend on Ribis (may not testify or judge).</p>
<p class="bas indent1"><span class="nm">(b)</span><span class="cl">(Rava):</span> One who borrows on Ribis is disqualified.</p>
<p class="bas indent1"><span class="nm">(c)</span><span class="cl">Question:</span> The Mishnah taught 'those who <i>lend </i>with Ribis!'</p>
<p class="bas indent1"><span class="nm">(d)</span><span class="cl">Answer:</span> It means, a loan on Ribis disqualifies (the lender and borrower).</p>
<p class="bas indent1"><span class="nm">(e)</span>Ploni testified 'I saw Bar Binisus borrow on Ribis', and Almoni testified 'I borrowed from Bar Binisus on Ribis.' Rava disqualified Bar Binisus.</p>
<p class="bas indent1"><span class="nm">(f)</span><span class="cl">Question:</span> Rava said that one who borrows on Ribis is disqualified. If so, Almoni is a Rasha - "Al Tesht Rasha Ed"!</p>
<p class="bas indent1"><span class="nm">(g)</span><span class="cl">Answer:</span> Rava ruled like another of his teachings.</p>
<p class="bas indent2"><span class="nm">1.</span><span class="cl">(Rava):</span> One is considered a relative with respect to himself, so he cannot disqualify himself by saying that he is a Rasha.</p>
<p class="bas indent1"><span class="nm">(h)</span>A butcher said that he sells Kosher meat, and it was found to be Treifah. Rav Nachman disqualified (many texts say - excommunicated) him and deposed him.</p>
<p class="bas indent2"><span class="nm">1.</span>The butcher let his hair and nails grow (signs of repentance); Rav Nachman thought to return him to his post.</p>
<p class="bas indent2"><span class="nm">2.</span><span class="cl">Rava:</span> Perhaps he is scheming!</p>
<p class="bas indent1"><span class="nm">(i)</span><span class="cl">Question:</span> How do we know that he has repented?</p>
<p class="bas indent1"><span class="nm">(j)</span><span class="cl">Answer:</span> Rav Idi bar Avin taught that one suspected to sell Treifah meat in the guise of Kosher is not trusted until he goes to a place where he is not known and returns a valuable lost object or admits that one of his animals is Treifah, and suffers a major loss.</p>
<p class="bas subject"><span class="nm">3)</span>MAFRICHEI YONIM</p>
<p class="bas indent1"><span class="nm">(a)</span><span class="cl">(Mishnah):</span> Mafrichei Yonim (are disqualified).</p>
<p class="bas indent1"><span class="nm">(b)</span><span class="cl">Question:</span> What does this mean?</p>
<p class="bas indent1"><span class="nm">(c)</span><span class="cl">Answer #1 (Chachamim of Bavel):</span> It is people who bet 'if my dove will come before your dove...'</p>
<p class="bas indent1"><span class="nm">(d)</span><span class="cl">Answer #2 (Rav Chama bar Oshaya):</span> It is people who train their doves to lure other doves after them (i.e. they take others' doves).</p>
<p class="bas indent1"><span class="nm">(e)</span><span class="cl">Question:</span> Why didn't Chachamim of Bavel say this?</p>
<p class="bas indent1"><span class="nm">(f)</span><span class="cl">Answer:</span> That is (not real theft, for flying birds are Hefker. Taking them is) considered theft only mid'Rabanan, due to Darchei (the ways of) Shalom.</p>
<p class="bas indent1"><span class="nm">(g)</span><span class="cl">Question:</span> Why didn't Rav Chama bar Oshaya say that they race birds?</p>
<p class="bas indent1"><span class="nm">(h)</span><span class="cl">Answer:</span> The Mishnah already taught diceplayers!</p>
<p class="bas indent2"><span class="nm">1.</span>Chachamim of Bavel say that the Tana needed to teach both. Diceplayers expect to win due to their own skill. Bird racers expect to win due to their birds.</p>
<p class="bas indent2"><span class="nm">2.</span>Had the Tana taught only one who relies on himself, one might have thought this is Asmachta, for he is sure that he knows better, but one who relies on his bird realizes that he may win or lose (and resolves to pay if he loses);</p>
<p class="bas bbbline">25b----------------------------------------25b</p>
<p class="bas indent2"><span class="nm">3.</span>Had he taught only one who relies on his bird, one might have thought that this is Asmachta, for he is sure he will win, for he is more skilled to bang on boards to make his bird go faster, but a diceplayer realizes that he may lose.</p>
<p class="bas indent1"><span class="nm">(i)</span><span class="cl">Question (Beraisa):</span> Diceplayers are people who play (and bet) with chips of wood, or nut shells or pomegranate rinds;</p>
<p class="bas indent2"><span class="nm">1.</span><span class="cl">Question:</span> How do we know when they have repented?</p>
<p class="bas indent2"><span class="nm">2.</span><span class="cl">Answer:</span> It is when they break their chips and fully cease their former actions, and they do not even play without betting.</p>
<p class="bas indent2"><span class="nm">3.</span>People who lend on Ribis are disqualified, and also people who borrow on Ribis;</p>
<p class="bas indent3"><span class="nm">i.</span>We know that they have repented when they tear up their documents and fully cease their former actions, and do not lend even to Nochrim on Ribis.</p>
<p class="bas indent2"><span class="nm">4.</span>Mafrichei Yonim are people who incite their doves. The same applies to those who incite Behemos or Chayos (domestic or wild animals) or birds;</p>
<p class="bas indent3"><span class="nm">i.</span>We know that they have repented when they break their boards and fully cease their former actions, that they will not do so even in the wilderness.</p>
<p class="bas indent2"><span class="nm">5.</span>Socharei Shemitah are people who buy and sell Shemitah Peros;</p>
<p class="bas indent3"><span class="nm">i.</span>We know that they have repented when the next Shemitah comes, and they refrain.</p>
<p class="bas indent3"><span class="nm">ii.</span>R. Nechemyah says, verbal repentance does not suffice. They must return money, e.g. 'I profited 100 Zuz from selling Shemitah Peros. I give it to the poor.'</p>
<p class="bas indent2"><span class="nm">6.</span><span class="cl">Summation of question:</span> It says that Mafrichei Yonim applies also to Behemos. This is like the opinion that Mafrichei Yonim race doves;</p>
<p class="bas indent3"><span class="nm">i.</span>However, if Mafrichei Yonim train their doves to lure other doves after them, this does not apply to Behemos! (It is clear from below that we know <i>Chayos</i> that bring others' animals.)</p>
<p class="bas indent1"><span class="nm">(j)</span><span class="cl">Answer:</span> It applies to Shor ha'Bar (a wild ox or bison. One can train it to lure animals from quarries. Also this is theft due to Darchei Shalom.)</p>
<p class="bas indent2"><span class="nm">1.</span>This is like the opinion that Shor ha'Bar is a Behemah.</p>
<p class="bas indent3"><span class="nm">i.</span><span class="cl">(Mishnah):</span> Shor ha'Bar is a Behemah;</p>
<p class="bas indent3"><span class="nm">ii.</span>R. Yosi says, it is a Chayah.</p>
<p class="bas subject"><span class="nm">4)</span>OTHERS WHO ARE DISQUALIFIED</p>
<p class="bas indent1"><span class="nm">(a)</span><span class="cl">(Beraisa):</span> Chachamim later decreed that also robbers and Chamsanim (people who force others to sell) are disqualified.</p>
<p class="bas indent1"><span class="nm">(b)</span><span class="cl">Question:</span> Robbers are disqualified mid'Oraisa!</p>
<p class="bas indent1"><span class="nm">(c)</span><span class="cl">Answer:</span> This refers to one who takes an object found by a child, lunatic or deaf-mute;</p>
<p class="bas indent2"><span class="nm">1.</span>Originally, they did not disqualify them, for it is not common, or, because it is theft only due to Darchei Shalom;</p>
<p class="bas indent2"><span class="nm">2.</span>Later, they disqualified them, for they do take others' money.</p>
<p class="bas indent1"><span class="nm">(d)</span>Originally, they did not disqualify Chamsanim, for they pay. They merely coerce the owner to sell (the sale is valid);</p>
<p class="bas indent2"><span class="nm">1.</span>Later, they disqualified them, for they saw that they take and give money, even if the owners do not agree to sell.</p>
<p class="bas indent1"><span class="nm">(e)</span><span class="cl">(Beraisa):</span> Chachamim later decreed that also shepherds, Gaba'im and Muchsim (tax collectors) are disqualified.</p>
<p class="bas indent2"><span class="nm">1.</span>Originally, they did not disqualify shepherds, for they thought that it is just by chance that their animals graze in others' fields;</p>
<p class="bas indent2"><span class="nm">2.</span>Later, they disqualified them, for they saw that they intend for this.</p>
<p class="bas indent2"><span class="nm">3.</span>Originally, they did not disqualify tax collectors, because they thought that they only take what they are entitled to;</p>
<p class="bas indent2"><span class="nm">4.</span>Later, they disqualified them, for they saw that they take more than they should.</p>
<p class="bas indent1"><span class="nm">(f)</span><span class="cl">(Rava):</span> Shepherds of small animals (i.e. that do not work) and of big animals are disqualified.</p>
<p class="bas indent1"><span class="nm">(g)</span><span class="cl">Contradiction (Rava):</span> Shepherds of small animals in Eretz Yisrael are disqualified. In Chutz la'Aretz they are Kesherim;</p>
<p class="bas indent2"><span class="nm">1.</span>Shepherds of big animals are Kesherim even in Eretz Yisrael.</p>
<p class="bas indent1"><span class="nm">(h)</span><span class="cl">Resolution:</span> The latter teaching refers to people who raise animals in their houses (big animals can be guarded properly, but small animals escape and graze in others' fields. The former teaching refers to people who raise animals in the field. Even big animals graze in others' fields.)</p>
<p class="bas indent1"><span class="nm">(i)</span><span class="cl">Support (Mishnah - R. Meir):</span> If one party said 'you may use my father, or your father, or three cattle shepherds...'</p>
<p class="bas indent2"><span class="nm">1.</span><span class="cl">Suggestion:</span> He allows the other party to use them for witnesses (but normally, they are disqualified)!</p>
<p class="bas indent1"><span class="nm">(j)</span><span class="cl">Rejection:</span> No, he allows the other party to use them for judges. (Letter of the law, they are Pasul, for  are unlearned).</p>
<p class="bas indent1"><span class="nm">(k)</span><span class="cl">Support:</span> Presumably, this is correct, for the Mishnah mentions <i>three</i> cattle shepherds. If he accepts them to testify, only two are needed!</p>
<p class="bas indent1"><span class="nm">(l)</span><span class="cl">Question:</span> If he allows the other party to use them for judges (but normally, they are Pasul for they are unlearned), why does it mention shepherds? It could have mentioned any three unlearned people!</p>
<p class="bas indent1"><span class="nm">(m)</span><span class="cl">Answer:</span> Shepherds are not normally in town and never see Beis Din. This is a Chidush (that Chachamim say that even so, he cannot retract.)</p>
<p class="bas indent1"><span class="nm">(n)</span><span class="cl">(Rav Yehudah):</span> We assume that a shepherd is disqualified (even before we see him graze animals in others' fields). We assume that a tax collector is Kosher (until we hear that he takes too much).</p>
<p class="bas indent1"><span class="nm">(o)</span>R. Zeira's father collected taxes for 13 years. He would collect a minimal amount, and tell the mayor that there are few people in the city. When the mayor was around, R. Zeira's father would tell people to hide, lest the mayor see many people and demand more taxes.</p>
<p class="bas indent2"><span class="nm">1.</span>To Chachamim, he would say "Lech Ami Bo va'Chadarecha." He did not fear lest they inform on him that he tells them to hide;</p>
<p class="bas indent2"><span class="nm">2.</span>To others, he would hint subtly that the mayor will demand more if he sees many people. They understood and hid.</p>
<p class="bas indent1"><span class="nm">(p)</span>When he was dying, he commanded 'I have 13 coins wrapped up. I collected them from Ploni. Return them, for I will not need to give to them to the mayor.'</p>
