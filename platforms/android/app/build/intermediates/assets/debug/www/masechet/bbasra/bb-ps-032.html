<p class="bas subject"><span class="nm">1)</span>CONCERN FOR THE HONOR OF BEIS DIN</p>
<p class="bas indent1"><span class="nm">(a)</span><span class="cl">Question:</span> R. Elazar and R. Shimon ben Gamliel say the same thing!</p>
<p class="bas indent2"><span class="nm">1.</span><span class="cl">Suggestion:</span> R. Elazar says that even one person can challenge his lineage, and R. Shimon ben Gamliel requires two.</p>
<p class="bas indent2"><span class="nm">2.</span><span class="cl">Rejection:</span> R. Yochanan taught that all agree that two are needed to challenge.</p>
<p class="bas indent1"><span class="nm">(b)</span><span class="cl">Answer #1:</span> Rather, they argue in a case when two challenged.</p>
<p class="bas indent2"><span class="nm">1.</span>The case is, we know that David's father is a Kohen. There were rumors that David's mother was divorced or a Chalutzah,</p>
<p class="bas indent2"><span class="nm">2.</span>Beis Din put David's status in question until it would be researched. One witness said that David is a valid Kohen, and he was re-established to be a Kohen.</p>
<p class="bas indent2"><span class="nm">3.</span>Two witnesses then came and said that his mother was divorced or a Chalutzah, so Beis Din declared that he is not a Kohen. Another witness came and said that David is a Kohen.</p>
<p class="bas indent2"><span class="nm">4.</span>All agree that the first and last witnesses, in general, can join. They argue about whether here we are concerned for disgrace to Beis Din.</p>
<p class="bas indent2"><span class="nm">5.</span>R. Elazar is concerned. Since Beis Din disqualified him, they do not reinstate him;</p>
<p class="bas indent2"><span class="nm">6.</span>R. Shimon ben Gamliel says, they reinstate him. We are not concerned for disgrace to Beis Din.</p>
<p class="bas indent1"><span class="nm">(c)</span><span class="cl">Objection (Rav Ashi):</span> The Mishnah implies that two witnesses always suffice to establish someone to be a Kohen;</p>
<p class="bas indent2"><span class="nm">1.</span>If R. Elazar is concerned for disgrace to Beis Din, even if two witnesses come together (after others disqualified him), we would not reinstate him!</p>
<p class="bas indent1"><span class="nm">(d)</span><span class="cl">Answer #2 (Rav Ashi):</span> Rather, all agree that we are not concerned for disgrace to Beis Din;</p>
<p class="bas indent2"><span class="nm">1.</span>They argue about when we can join witnesses, like R. Noson and Chachamim argue (in the end of this Beraisa):</p>
<p class="bas indent2"><span class="nm">2.</span><span class="cl">(Beraisa):</span> Two witnesses cannot testify together unless they saw the testimony together;</p>
<p class="bas indent2"><span class="nm">3.</span>R. Yehoshua ben Korchah says, even if they saw the testimony at different times, they join.</p>
<p class="bas indent2"><span class="nm">4.</span>We cannot join the testimony of two witnesses unless they testify together;</p>
<p class="bas indent2"><span class="nm">5.</span>R. Noson says, they can testify at different times.</p>
<p class="bas subject"><span class="nm">2)</span>A MIGO SUPPORTING A DOCUMENT</p>
<p class="bas indent1"><span class="nm">(a)</span>Reuven challenged Shimon 'what are you doing on my field?' Shimon said 'I bought it. Here is the document.'</p>
<p class="bas bbbline">32b----------------------------------------32b</p>
<p class="bas indent1"><span class="nm">(b)</span><span class="cl">Reuven:</span> That is a forgery!</p>
<p class="bas indent1"><span class="nm">(c)</span>Shimon whispered to Rabah (who was judging the case) 'indeed, it is a forgery, but I had a proper document and I lost it.' (The case is, Shimon could have validated the document.)</p>
<p class="bas indent1"><span class="nm">(d)</span><span class="cl">Rabah:</span> Shimon is believed. Had he wanted to lie, he could have insisted that it is a proper document!</p>
<p class="bas indent1"><span class="nm">(e)</span><span class="cl">Rav Yosef:</span> We cannot rule in Shimon's favor due to the document, for now we know that the document is a forgery!</p>
<p class="bas indent1"><span class="nm">(f)</span>Levi asked Yehudah to pay the money he owes, and showed the loan document.</p>
<p class="bas indent1"><span class="nm">(g)</span><span class="cl">Yehudah:</span> That is a forgery!</p>
<p class="bas indent1"><span class="nm">(h)</span>Levi whispered to Rabah 'indeed, it is a forgery, but I had a proper document and I lost it.'</p>
<p class="bas indent1"><span class="nm">(i)</span><span class="cl">Rabah:</span> Levi is believed, for he could have insisted that it is a proper document!</p>
<p class="bas indent1"><span class="nm">(j)</span><span class="cl">Rav Yosef:</span> We cannot rule in his favor due to the document, for now we know that it is a forgery!</p>
<p class="bas indent1"><span class="nm">(k)</span><span class="cl">(Rav Idi bar Avin):</span> The Halachah follows Rav Yosef in a dispute over money. The Halachah follows Rabah in a dispute over land. (Rashbam - we are in doubt whom the Halachah follows, so we leave the property where it is; Tosfos - we apply Migo only to keep property, but not to take it.)0</p>
<p class="bas indent2"><span class="nm">1.</span>The Halachah follows Rabah in a dispute over land. Shimon is now on the land, we leave him there;</p>
<p class="bas indent2"><span class="nm">2.</span>The Halachah follows Rav Yosef in a dispute over money. We leave the money where it is (with Yehudah).</p>
<p class="bas subject"><span class="nm">3)</span>BORROWING BACK MONEY THAT WAS PAID UP</p>
<p class="bas indent1"><span class="nm">(a)</span>Reuven, the Arev (guarantor) for a loan, told Shimon (the borrower) 'I paid up your loan. Here is the document. Pay me back.'</p>
<p class="bas indent1"><span class="nm">(b)</span><span class="cl">Shimon:</span> I already paid you back!</p>
<p class="bas indent1"><span class="nm">(c)</span><span class="cl">Reuven:</span> You borrowed the money back again!</p>
<p class="bas indent1"><span class="nm">(d)</span>Shimon denied this.</p>
<p class="bas indent1"><span class="nm">(e)</span><span class="cl">Question (Rav Idi bar Avin):</span> What is the law?</p>
<p class="bas indent2"><span class="nm">1.</span><span class="cl">Question (Abaye):</span> Why do you ask? You yourself said that the Halachah follows Rabah regarding land, and Rav Yosef regarding money! (This is a case of money, so) we leave the money where it is (with Shimon)!</p>
<p class="bas indent2"><span class="nm">2.</span>This is only if Reuven claims that Shimon borrowed the money again. If Reuven says that he returned the coins because they were rubbed out or reddish (and he demands to receive good coins), the document is still in force, and Shimon must pay.</p>
