<p class="bas subject"><span class="nm">1)</span>PEOPLE WHO FELL AND DAMAGED OR WERE DAMAGED</p>
<p class="bas indent1"><span class="nm">(a)</span>If the baby landed on the horns of an ox and died, R. Yishmael (son of R. Yochanan ben Berokah) and Chachamim argue about whether or not the owner pays Kofer.</p>
<p class="bas indent2"><span class="nm">1.</span><span class="cl">(Beraisa):</span> "He will give redemption of his soul" - the value of the victim (here, since the baby was destined to die, he has no value, so there is no Kofer);</p>
<p class="bas indent2"><span class="nm">2.</span>R. Yishmael says, the owner of the ox pays his own value (so he pays Kofer).</p>
<p class="bas indent1"><span class="nm">(b)</span><span class="cl">(Rabah):</span> If a man fell off a roof (in a normal wind) and landed on a woman, he pays four damages. If she was his Yevamah (and he had Bi'ah due to the fall), he does not acquire her.</p>
<p class="bas indent2"><span class="nm">1.</span>He pays Nezek, pain, medical expenses and temporary Sheves, but not embarrassment.</p>
<p class="bas indent3"><span class="nm">i.</span><span class="cl">(Mishnah):</span> One pays for embarrassment only if he intended to damage.</p>
<p class="bas indent1"><span class="nm">(c)</span><span class="cl">(Rabah):</span> If one fell off a roof in an abnormal wind and damaged, he pays Nezek, but not the four damages. If he fell in a normal wind, he pays four damages, but is exempt for embarrassment;</p>
<p class="bas indent2"><span class="nm">1.</span>If he turned (in midair to land on the person), he is liable even for embarrassment.</p>
<p class="bas indent2"><span class="nm">2.</span><span class="cl">(Beraisa):</span> Obviously, "she stuck out her hand" to grab (the private parts of the man fighting her husband)! It says "and grabbed" to teach that intent to damage obligates payment for embarrassment, even without intent to embarrass.</p>
<p class="bas subject"><span class="nm">2)</span>LIABILITY FOR BURNING</p>
<p class="bas indent1"><span class="nm">(a)</span><span class="cl">(Rabah):</span> If Reuven put a coal on Shimon's heart, and Shimon died from it, Reuven is exempt (because Shimon should have removed it).</p>
<p class="bas indent2"><span class="nm">1.</span>If he put it on Shimon's clothing and they were burned, Reuven is liable.</p>
<p class="bas indent1"><span class="nm">(b)</span><span class="cl">Rava:</span> We learn both of these from Mishnayos:</p>
<p class="bas indent2"><span class="nm">1.</span><span class="cl">(Mishnah):</span> If Reuven held Shimon in a fire or in water so that Shimon could not escape, Reuven is liable;</p>
<p class="bas indent3"><span class="nm">i.</span>If he pushed him in, and Shimon could have escaped, Reuven is exempt.</p>
<p class="bas indent2"><span class="nm">2.</span><span class="cl">(Mishnah):</span> If Reuven told Shimon 'tear my garment' or 'break my jug', and Shimon did so, he is liable;</p>
<p class="bas indent3"><span class="nm">i.</span>If he said 'on condition that you will be exempt', he is exempt.</p>
<p class="bas indent1"><span class="nm">(c)</span><span class="cl">Question #1 (Rabah):</span> If Reuven put a coal on the heart of Shimon's slave; and the slave died, is this like putting the coal on Shimon, or like on Shimon's money?</p>
<p class="bas indent1"><span class="nm">(d)</span><span class="cl">Question #2 (Rabah):</span> If it is not like putting the coal on Shimon, if he puts it on Shimon's ox, what is the law?</p>
<p class="bas indent1"><span class="nm">(e)</span><span class="cl">Answer (Rabah):</span> The slave is like Shimon (for he knows to remove it). The ox is like his money (it lacks understanding).</p>
<p class="perekline">PEREK HA'MENI'ACH</p>
<p class="bas subject"><span class="nm">3)</span>INTERCHANGEABLE WORDS</p>
<p class="bas indent1"><span class="nm">(a)</span><span class="cl">(Mishnah):</span> If Reuven left his Kad (jug) in a Reshus ha'Rabim, and Shimon came and tripped on it, and it broke, Shimon is exempt from paying for it.</p>
<p class="bas indent2"><span class="nm">1.</span>If Shimon was hurt by it, (Reuven,) the owner of the Chavis (barrel) must pay the damage.</p>
<p class="bas indent1"><span class="nm">(b)</span><span class="cl">(Gemara) Question #1:</span> Why does it first call it a jug, and then call it a barrel?</p>
<p class="bas indent1"><span class="nm">(c)</span><span class="cl">Question #2 (Mishnah #2):</span> If Levi was walking with a barrel, and Yehudah with a beam, and the jug broke when it hit the beam, Yehudah is exempt.</p>
<p class="bas indent2"><span class="nm">1.</span>There it calls it a barrel, and then a jug!</p>
<p class="bas indent1"><span class="nm">(d)</span><span class="cl">Question #3 (Mishnah #3):</span> If Levi was carrying a barrel of wine and Yehudah was carrying a jug of honey, and Yehudah's barrel cracked and Levi spilled out his wine and saved the honey, he is paid only like a worker (he is not compensated for the wine he sacrificed).</p>
<p class="bas indent2"><span class="nm">1.</span>First it calls it a jug; and later it calls it a barrel!</p>
<p class="bas indent1"><span class="nm">(e)</span><span class="cl">Answer (Rav Papa - to all three questions):</span> The two words are interchangeable.</p>
<p class="bas indent1"><span class="nm">(f)</span><span class="cl">Question:</span> Why does the Tana bother to teach this?</p>
<p class="bas indent1"><span class="nm">(g)</span><span class="cl">Answer:</span> It pertains to commerce.</p>
<p class="bas indent1"><span class="nm">(h)</span><span class="cl">Question:</span> What is the case?</p>
<p class="bas indent2"><span class="nm">1.</span>If in this place a jug is not called a barrel, nor vice-versa, one must give what the buyer requested!</p>
<p class="bas indent1"><span class="nm">(i)</span><span class="cl">Answer:</span> The case is, most people call a jug 'Kad' and a barrel 'Chavis'. A minority of people call a barrel 'Kad' and a jug 'Chavis'.</p>
<p class="bas indent2"><span class="nm">1.</span>One might have thought that we follow the majority (i.e. a buyer who asked for a Chavis may demand a barrel);</p>
<p class="bas bbbline">27b----------------------------------------27b</p>
<p class="bas indent2"><span class="nm">2.</span>The Mishnah teaches that this is not so. In monetary matters, we do not follow the majority.</p>
<p class="bas subject"><span class="nm">4)</span>WHEN IS ONE LIABLE FOR TRIPPING?</p>
<p class="bas indent1"><span class="nm">(a)</span><span class="cl">(Mishnah):</span> If Shimon came and tripped on it, and it broke, he is exempt from paying for it.</p>
<p class="bas indent1"><span class="nm">(b)</span><span class="cl">Question:</span> Why is Shimon exempt? He should look where he walks!</p>
<p class="bas indent1"><span class="nm">(c)</span><span class="cl">Answer #1 (Rav):</span> The case is, Reuven filled the Reshus ha'Rabim with jugs.</p>
<p class="bas indent1"><span class="nm">(d)</span><span class="cl">Answer #2 (Shmuel):</span> The case is, it was dark.</p>
<p class="bas indent1"><span class="nm">(e)</span><span class="cl">Answer #3 (R. Yochanan):</span> The jug was around a corner, out of his sight.</p>
<p class="bas indent1"><span class="nm">(f)</span><span class="cl">Question (Rav Papa):</span> The wording of the Mishnah is unlike Rav's explanation!</p>
<p class="bas indent2"><span class="nm">1.</span>According to Rav, why does the Mishnah say 'he tripped'? He should be exempt even if he  broke it b'Mezid!</p>
<p class="bas indent1"><span class="nm">(g)</span><span class="cl">Answer (Rav Zvid):</span> Indeed, even if he breaks it, he is exempt. The Mishnah discusses tripping, so the Reisha can teach that if Shimon (tripped and) was hurt, Reuven must pay.</p>
<p class="bas indent2"><span class="nm">1.</span>If Shimon (intentionally) broke it and got hurt, Reuven would be exempt.</p>
<p class="bas indent2"><span class="nm">2.</span><span class="cl">Question:</span> What is the reason?</p>
<p class="bas indent2"><span class="nm">3.</span><span class="cl">Answer:</span> He brought the damage on himself.</p>
<p class="bas indent2"><span class="nm">4.</span>Since the Reisha discusses tripping, also the Seifa discusses tripping.</p>
<p class="bas indent1"><span class="nm">(h)</span><span class="cl">Answer #4 (R. Aba):</span> Shimon is exempt, because normally people do not look where they walk.</p>
<p class="bas indent1"><span class="nm">(i)</span>A case occurred in Neharda'a, and Shmuel obligated one who tripped to pay. A case occurred in Pumbedisa, and Rava obligated one who tripped to pay.</p>
<p class="bas indent1"><span class="nm">(j)</span>Shmuel is consistent with his explanation of the Mishnah.</p>
<p class="bas indent1"><span class="nm">(k)</span><span class="cl">Inference:</span> We can deduce that Rava holds like Shmuel.</p>
<p class="bas indent1"><span class="nm">(l)</span><span class="cl">Rejection (Rav Papa):</span> Perhaps he holds like R. Aba.  He ruled in a case of Kelim left near the corner of the olive-press;</p>
<p class="bas indent2"><span class="nm">1.</span>Since the owner was allowed to leave his Kelim there (such is the custom), one who walks must watch his step. Since he did not, he must pay.</p>
<p class="bas subject"><span class="nm">5)</span>WHEN MAY ONE TAKE THE LAW INTO HIS OWN HANDS?</p>
<p class="bas indent1"><span class="nm">(a)</span><span class="cl">(Rav Chisda):</span> The custom is, one who kicks someone with his knee must pay three Sela'im (for embarrassment alone). For kicking with the foot, he pays five Sela'im; for hitting him with a donkey's saddle, he pays 13.</p>
<p class="bas indent1"><span class="nm">(b)</span><span class="cl">Question (Rav Chisda):</span> How much must one pay for hitting with the handle or blade of a shovel?</p>
<p class="bas indent2"><span class="nm">1.</span><span class="cl">Objection (Rav Nachman):</span> We do not obligate people to pay fines in Bavel! What case (do you ask about)?</p>
<p class="bas indent2"><span class="nm">2.</span><span class="cl">Answer (Rav Chisda):</span> There were two partners in a pit of water. Each day, one of them would water his field from it. One day, one was using it on his partner's day.</p>
<p class="bas indent2"><span class="nm">3.</span>The partner protested, to no avail. He hit the one using it with the handle of a shovel.</p>
<p class="bas indent1"><span class="nm">(c)</span><span class="cl">Answer (Rav Nachman):</span> He can hit him 100 times, and he is exempt!</p>
<p class="bas indent2"><span class="nm">1.</span>Even the opinion that forbids taking the law into one's own hands, admits that one may do so to avoid a loss.</p>
<p class="bas indent1"><span class="nm">(d)</span><span class="cl">(Rav Yehudah):</span> One may not take the law into his own hands;</p>
<p class="bas indent1"><span class="nm">(e)</span><span class="cl">(Rav Nachman):</span> One may do so.</p>
<p class="bas indent1"><span class="nm">(f)</span>All permit when needed to avoid a loss. They argue about when there is no loss;</p>
<p class="bas indent2"><span class="nm">1.</span>Rav Yehudah forbids, for he can go to Beis Din!</p>
<p class="bas indent2"><span class="nm">2.</span>Rav Nachman permits. Since he acts properly, he need not exert himself to go to Beis Din.</p>
<p class="bas indent1"><span class="nm">(g)</span><span class="cl">Question (Rav Kahana - Beraisa - Ben Bag Bag):</span> Do not enter your friend's property to take what is yours without permission. Perhaps you will appear like a thief to him! Rather, blunt his teeth and say 'I am taking what is mine!'</p>
