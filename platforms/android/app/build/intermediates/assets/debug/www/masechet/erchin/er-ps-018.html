<p class="bas subject"><span class="nm">1)</span><i>KASHRUS</i> FOR TESTIMONY</p>
<p class="bas indent1"><span class="nm">(a)</span><span class="cl">Answer:</span> Testimony is different. "Oh Ra'ah... Im Lo Yagid" teaches that it depends only on being Kosher at the time of seeing and testifying.</p>
<p class="bas indent1"><span class="nm">(b)</span><span class="cl">Question:</span> What do we learn from "v'<i>Hu</i>"?</p>
<p class="bas indent1"><span class="nm">(c)</span><span class="cl">Answer (Beraisa) Suggestion:</span> If one saw a throng of people and witnesses were among them, and he said "I impose an oath on you that you will testify for me if you know testimony", perhaps they are liable!</p>
<p class="bas indent2"><span class="nm">1.</span><span class="cl">Rejection:</span> "V'Hu Ed" exempts. He must specify the witnesses.</p>
<p class="bas indent2"><span class="nm">2.</span><span class="cl">Suggestion:</span> Perhaps even if he said "(I impose an oath on) you who are standing here," they are exempt!</p>
<p class="bas indent2"><span class="nm">3.</span><span class="cl">Rejection:</span> "V'Hu Ed" is Mechayev, since he specified the witnesses.</p>
<p class="bas subject"><span class="nm">2)</span>ASSETS THAT DO NOT MAKE ONE AN <i>ASHIR</i></p>
<p class="bas indent1"><span class="nm">(a)</span><span class="cl">(Mishnah):</span> The law of Korbanos is different...</p>
<p class="bas indent1"><span class="nm">(b)</span><span class="cl">Question:</span> If Ploni's father died, leaving him a fortune, Ploni is an Ashir!</p>
<p class="bas indent1"><span class="nm">(c)</span><span class="cl">Answer (R. Avahu):</span> It means, even if he was going to inherit from his father (he brings Korban Oni).</p>
<p class="bas indent1"><span class="nm">(d)</span><span class="cl">Objection:</span> This is obvious!</p>
<p class="bas indent1"><span class="nm">(e)</span><span class="cl">Answer:</span> The case is, his father was Goses (about to die);</p>
<p class="bas indent2"><span class="nm">1.</span>One might have thought that since most Gosesim die, it is as if he already died. The Mishnah teaches that this is not so.</p>
<p class="bas indent1"><span class="nm">(f)</span><span class="cl">Question:</span> The Mishnah says 'even if his ship is coming in with a fortune.' If so, he is an Ashir (even though the money is not here yet)!</p>
<p class="bas indent1"><span class="nm">(g)</span><span class="cl">Answer (Rav Chisda):</span> The case is, he does not own the cargo. He rented the ship to others.</p>
<p class="bas indent1"><span class="nm">(h)</span><span class="cl">Question:</span> They owe him the rent! (Therefore, he is an Ashir!)</p>
<p class="bas indent1"><span class="nm">(i)</span><span class="cl">Answer:</span> Rental is not due until the end of the rental.</p>
<p class="bas indent1"><span class="nm">(j)</span><span class="cl">Question:</span> He is an Ashir because he owns a ship!</p>
<p class="bas indent1"><span class="nm">(k)</span><span class="cl">Answer:</span> Our Mishnah is like R. Eliezer:</p>
<p class="bas indent2"><span class="nm">1.</span><span class="cl">(Mishnah - R. Eliezer):</span> If a farmer owes Erchin, we let him keep his yoked animals. (He gives Erech Oni. He need not sell them, for his income depends on them.) If a donkey-driver owes Erchin, we let him keep his donkey. (Similarly, we leave to Ploni his ship, for for his income is from renting it out.)</p>
<p class="bas subject"><span class="nm">3)</span>WHAT DETERMINES <i>ERCHIN</i></p>
<p class="bas indent1"><span class="nm">(a)</span><span class="cl">(Mishnah):</span> The years (that determine the Erech) are according to the Nidar:</p>
<p class="bas indent2"><span class="nm">1.</span>If a Yeled (someone between 20 and 60) was Ma'arich an elder (above 60), he pays the Erech of an elder. If an elder was Ma'arich a Yeled, he pays the Erech of a Yeled.</p>
<p class="bas indent1"><span class="nm">(b)</span>Erchin is according to (the gender of) the Ne'erach;</p>
<p class="bas indent2"><span class="nm">1.</span>If a man was Ma'arich a woman, he pays the Erech of a woman. If a woman was Ma'arich a man, she pays the Erech of a man.</p>
<p class="bas indent1"><span class="nm">(c)</span>The Erech is paid according to (the age at) the time of the Erech:</p>
<p class="bas indent2"><span class="nm">1.</span>If Reuven was Ma'arich someone less than five (or 20) years, and (before paying) the Ne'erach completed five (or 20) years, Reuven pays according to the time of the Erech.</p>
<p class="bas indent1"><span class="nm">(d)</span><span class="cl">(Gemara - Beraisa):</span> (Vows of) Damim are equated to Erchin regarding two things:</p>
<p class="bas indent2"><span class="nm">1.</span>A cheap estimation of a pearl. (If it sells for 30 here, it is considered to be worth 30, even if he could sell it for 50 in the city. This affects Heseg Yad and one who vowed to give its value to Hekdesh);</p>
<p class="bas indent2"><span class="nm">2.</span>Limbs are judged bi'Chvodo. (If a vital limb was Ne'erach or Nidar, the Erech or Damim of the entire person must be given.)</p>
<p class="bas indent1"><span class="nm">(e)</span><span class="cl">Suggestion:</span> Perhaps we should equate Erchin to Damim also to evaluate them according to the time of payment! (Rashi - surely, Damim is according to the time of payment, for it is according to the Nidar's slave value. Beis Din did not see the Nidar at the time of the vow, only when the Noder comes to pay! Tosfos - we expound this from a verse.)</p>
<p class="bas indent1"><span class="nm">(f)</span><span class="cl">Rejection:</span> "K'Erkecha Yakum" teaches that he pays according to the time of the vow. (Tosfos Yom Tov - this verse is written regarding Sedeh Achuzah. We do not need it to teach about Sedeh Achuzah, so it teaches about Erchin.)</p>
<p class="bas subject"><span class="nm">4)</span>THE YEARS OF <i>ERCHIN</i></p>
<p class="bas indent1"><span class="nm">(a)</span><span class="cl">(Mishnah):</span> (A Ne'erach on) the 30th day is like before the 30th day (he has no Erech). During the fifth year is like before the fifth year. (The Erech is like under five years.) During the 20th year is like before the 20th year;</p>
<p class="bas indent2"><span class="nm">1.</span>"V'Im mi'Ben Shishim Shanah va'Ma'alah" teaches about all other years. During the 60th year is like before 60 (only Shishim va'Ma'alah, i.e. after 60 years are completed, is like after 60). The same applies to years five and 20.</p>
<p class="bas indent1"><span class="nm">(b)</span><span class="cl">Objection:</span> It is a stringency to consider during the 60th year like before 60 (this obligates paying the biggest Erech). We cannot learn to years five and 20, for then it is a leniency!</p>
<p class="bas indent1"><span class="nm">(c)</span><span class="cl">Answer:</span> We learn from a Gezeirah Shavah "Shanah- Shanah" from year 60 to years five and 20. During the year is like before the year, whether this is a stringency or leniency.</p>
<p class="bas indent1"><span class="nm">(d)</span>R. Eliezer says, one does not enter the next age bracket until a month and a day into the next year.</p>
<p class="bas indent1"><span class="nm">(e)</span><span class="cl">(Gemara):</span> We must say that the Gezeirah Shavah is Mufneh (both words are extra, therefore we do not challenge the Gezeirah Shavah). If not, we would challenge it like in the Mishnah! (We would not learn a leniency from a stringency.)</p>
<p class="bas indent1"><span class="nm">(f)</span><span class="cl">Answer:</span> Indeed, this is true. There was no need to repeat "Shanah" every time.</p>
<p class="bas indent1"><span class="nm">(g)</span><span class="cl">Suggestion:</span> Our Mishnah is unlike Rebbi, who says that "Ad" (until) does not include (the ending point, as follows):</p>
<p class="bas indent2"><span class="nm">1.</span><span class="cl">(Beraisa) Suggestion:</span> Perhaps "mi'Yom ha'Rishon Ad Yom ha'Shevi'i" (one who eats Chametz from the first day of Pesach until the seventh gets Kares) does not apply to days one and seven!</p>
<p class="bas bbbline">18b----------------------------------------18b</p>
<p class="bas indent3"><span class="nm">i.</span>We find so regarding a Metzora. He becomes Tahor if the Tzara'as spreads "mi'Rosho v'Ad Raglav", and this does not include the head or the legs.</p>
<p class="bas indent2"><span class="nm">2.</span><span class="cl">Rejection:</span> "Ad Yom ha'Echad v'Esrim la'Chodesh ba'Arev" (teaches that there is Kares also for the seventh day).</p>
<p class="bas indent2"><span class="nm">3.</span>Rebbi says, we need not learn from another verse. Yom Rishon and Yom ha'Shevi'i are included (because it says "Ad").</p>
<p class="bas indent1"><span class="nm">(h)</span><span class="cl">Rejection:</span> Our Mishnah is even like Rebbi. The connotations of the verses contradict each other, therefore we cannot learn from them;</p>
<p class="bas indent2"><span class="nm">1.</span>It says "mi'Ben Chodesh v'Ad Ben Chamesh Shanim." (This should include the fifth year like less than five). It says also "mi'Ben Chamesh v'Ad... "! (This implies that the fifth year is like more than five.)</p>
<p class="bas indent1"><span class="nm">(i)</span><span class="cl">(Beraisa):</span> "Mi'Rosho v'Ad Raglav" does not include the head or the legs.</p>
<p class="bas indent1"><span class="nm">(j)</span><span class="cl">Question:</span> What is the source of this?</p>
<p class="bas indent1"><span class="nm">(k)</span><span class="cl">Answer #1:</span> Simanim of Tum'ah of (Tzara'as of) the head (e.g. fine yellow hairs) are different than those of the foot (white hairs);</p>
<p class="bas indent1"><span class="nm">(l)</span><span class="cl">Answer #2:</span> Tzara'as does not apply to the head and foot, for we cannot fulfill "l'Chol Mar'e Einei ha'Kohen." (R. Gershom - they cannot be seen at the same time. Rashi - he cannot see the scalp under the hair, nor between the toes. Shitah Mekubetzes - the sole is not seen, for one is always stepping on it.)</p>
<p class="bas indent1"><span class="nm">(m)</span><span class="cl">(Mishnah - R. Eliezer):</span> One does not enter the next age bracket until a month and a day into the next year.</p>
<p class="bas indent1"><span class="nm">(n)</span><span class="cl">(Beraisa - R. Eliezer):</span> It says (regarding Erech of an elder) l'Ma'alah, like it says regarding (counting) Leviyim (Rashi; Tosfos - Pidyon ha'Ben);</p>
<p class="bas indent2"><span class="nm">1.</span>Just like there, we require a month and a day, also here. ('Above 60' means a month and a day after 60 full years.)</p>
<p class="bas indent2"><span class="nm">2.</span><span class="cl">Suggestion:</span> There, "l'Ma'alah" only adds one day to what is explicitly written (a month). We should say the same here!</p>
<p class="bas indent2"><span class="nm">3.</span><span class="cl">Rejection:</span> If so, the Gezeirah Shavah would not teach anything.</p>
<p class="bas subject"><span class="nm">5)</span>THINGS THAT MUST BE FULL YEARS</p>
<p class="bas indent1"><span class="nm">(a)</span><span class="cl">(Beraisa):</span> All of the following are full years me'Es l'Es:</p>
<p class="bas indent2"><span class="nm">1.</span>The years specified for (certain) Korbanos;</p>
<p class="bas indent2"><span class="nm">2.</span>The year in which one may redeem a house sold in a walled city;</p>
<p class="bas indent2"><span class="nm">3.</span>The two years one must wait before redeeming a field that he sold;</p>
<p class="bas indent2"><span class="nm">4.</span>The six years that an Eved Ivri serves;</p>
<p class="bas indent2"><span class="nm">5.</span>The years of a boy or girl. (This will be explained.)</p>
<p class="bas indent1"><span class="nm">(b)</span><span class="cl">Question:</span> What is the source for the years of Korbanos?</p>
<p class="bas indent1"><span class="nm">(c)</span><span class="cl">Answer (Rav Acha bar Yakov):</span> "Keves Ben <i>Shenaso</i>" teaches that it must be in <i>its</i> first year. (It need not be in the same calendar year, i.e. from Rosh Hashanah until Rosh Hashanah.)</p>
<p class="bas indent1"><span class="nm">(d)</span><span class="cl">Question:</span> What is the source for the year to redeem a house?</p>
<p class="bas indent1"><span class="nm">(e)</span><span class="cl">Answer:</span> "Ad Tom Shenas <i>Mimkaro</i>" is the year of <i>its</i> sale.</p>
<p class="bas indent1"><span class="nm">(f)</span><span class="cl">Question:</span> What is the source for the years before redeeming a field?</p>
<p class="bas indent1"><span class="nm">(g)</span><span class="cl">Answer:</span> It says "b'Mispar Shnei Sevu'os Yimkar Lach." ("Shnei" is extra, for Sevu'os connotes two. It) teaches that all the harvests of the two years are included, even if there are three. (I.e. he bought the field laden with produce, and twice harvests what he himself grew, and it ripened in the same season.)</p>
<p class="bas indent1"><span class="nm">(h)</span><span class="cl">Question:</span> What is the source for the six years of an Eved Ivri?</p>
<p class="bas indent1"><span class="nm">(i)</span><span class="cl">Answer:</span> "Shesh Shanim Ya'avod <i>uva'Shevi'is</i>" teaches that he also works in the seventh (calendar) year (if he was sold in the middle of a calendar year).</p>
<p class="bas indent1"><span class="nm">(j)</span><span class="cl">(Beraisa):</span> The years of a boy or girl must be full.</p>
<p class="bas indent1"><span class="nm">(k)</span><span class="cl">Question:</span> What does this refer to?</p>
<p class="bas indent1"><span class="nm">(l)</span><span class="cl">Answer #1 (Rav Gidal citing Rav):</span> It refers to the years of Erchin.</p>
<p class="bas indent1"><span class="nm">(m)</span><span class="cl">Answer #2 (Rav Yosef):</span> It refers to the Mishnayos in Perek "Yotzei Dofen" (in Maseches Nidah, which discuss the ages for Nedarim and relations).</p>
<p class="bas indent1"><span class="nm">(n)</span><span class="cl">Abaye (to Rav Yosef):</span> Do you argue with Rav Gidal (regarding the Halachah)?</p>
<p class="bas indent1"><span class="nm">(o)</span><span class="cl">Rav Yosef:</span> No. We agree that all of these must be full years. (We argue only about what the Beraisa refers to.)</p>
<p class="bas indent1"><span class="nm">(p)</span><span class="cl">Support:</span> Rav Gidal must agree. He cited Rav, who says that all the years in Perek Yotzei Dofen are full!</p>
<p class="bas indent2"><span class="nm">1.</span><span class="cl">Question:</span> Why didn't Rav Gidal say that "boy or girl" refers to the years in Yotzei Dofen?</p>
<p class="bas indent2"><span class="nm">2.</span><span class="cl">Answer:</span> Presumably, it resembles everything else in the Beraisa, in which the years are explicit in the Torah.</p>
<p class="bas indent2"><span class="nm">3.</span><span class="cl">Question:</span> Why didn't Rav Yosef say that the Beraisa refers to Erchin?</p>
<p class="bas indent2"><span class="nm">4.</span><span class="cl">Answer:</span> If so, it should have said "Zachar Oh Nekevah," the phrase used in the Parshah of Erchin.</p>
