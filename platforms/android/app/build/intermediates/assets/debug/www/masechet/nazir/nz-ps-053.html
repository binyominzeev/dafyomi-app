<p class="bas subject"><span class="nm">1)</span>BONES FROM THE SPINE OR SKULL (cont.)</p>
<p class="bas indent1"><span class="nm">(a)</span><span class="cl">Answer #2 (Beraisa - Shamai):</span> Even from one bone of the spine or skull (has Tum'as Ohel).</p>
<p class="bas indent2"><span class="nm">1.</span>This shows that the spine and skull are more stringent!</p>
<p class="bas indent1"><span class="nm">(b)</span><span class="cl">Rejection:</span> We cannot bring a proof from Shamai, for he is more stringent.</p>
<p class="bas indent1"><span class="nm">(c)</span><span class="cl">Inference:</span> Only Shamai, who is stringent, says that they are more stringent. Chachamim require a half Kav (to obligate a Nazir to shave)!</p>
<p class="bas indent1"><span class="nm">(d)</span><span class="cl">Rejection:</span> Perhaps Chachamim argue only about one bone from the spine or skull, but they agree that a quarter Kav suffices.</p>
<p class="bas subject"><span class="nm">2)</span>A QUARTER <i>KAV</i> OF BONES</p>
<p class="bas indent1"><span class="nm">(a)</span><span class="cl">(R. Eliezer):</span> Some early Chachamim said that a half Kav of bones or a half Log of blood is Metamei in every respect. A quarter Kav of bones or a quarter Log of blood has no Tum'as Ohel;</p>
<p class="bas indent2"><span class="nm">1.</span>Others said that even a quarter Kav of bones or a quarter Log of blood is Metamei in every respect;</p>
<p class="bas indent2"><span class="nm">2.</span>Later sages said that a half Kav of bones or a half Log of blood is Metamei in every respect. A quarter Kav of bones or a quarter Log of blood is Metamei b'Ohel regarding Terumah and Kodshim, but not regarding a Nazir or one offering the Korban Pesach.</p>
<p class="bas indent1"><span class="nm">(b)</span><span class="cl">Objection:</span> We do not rule like a third mediating opinion (i.e. of later sages; alternatively, it distinguishes between cases that the previous opinions did not mention)!</p>
<p class="bas indent1"><span class="nm">(c)</span><span class="cl">Answer (R. Yakov bar Idi):</span> Here we rule like the third opinion because they received the law from the last of the Nevi'im.</p>
<p class="bas subject"><span class="nm">3)</span><i>TUM'OS</i> FOR WHICH A <i>NAZIR</i> DOES NOT SHAVE</p>
<p class="bas indent1"><span class="nm">(a)</span><span class="cl">(Mishnah):</span> For these a Nazir shaves...</p>
<p class="bas indent1"><span class="nm">(b)</span>In the Reisha, these words hint at something for which he does not shave, i.e. a bone k'Se'orah;</p>
<p class="bas indent2"><span class="nm">1.</span>A Nazir shaves only if he touches or moves it, but not for entering a tent with such a bone.</p>
<p class="bas indent1"><span class="nm">(c)</span>These words are repeated in the Seifa to allude to something else for which he does not shave, i.e. a Sechuchis stone (Tosfos - a stone sticking out from a wall, and he does not know if it towered over him and Tum'ah; Rashi - a stone on a Mes or grave).</p>
<p class="bas indent1"><span class="nm">(d)</span><span class="cl">(Mishnah):</span> For half a Kav of bones...</p>
<p class="bas bbbline">53b----------------------------------------53b</p>
<p class="bas indent1"><span class="nm">(e)</span><span class="cl">Inference:</span> He shaves for half a Kav, but not for a quarter Kav.</p>
<p class="bas indent1"><span class="nm">(f)</span><span class="cl">Question:</span> What is the case?</p>
<p class="bas indent2"><span class="nm">1.</span><span class="cl">Suggestion:</span> If among them is a bone k'Se'orah, for that alone he must shave! (Tosfos - even though our Mishnah discusses Tum'as Ohel, the inference connotes that he shaves for touching a quarter Kav.)</p>
<p class="bas indent1"><span class="nm">(g)</span><span class="cl">Answer:</span> The case is, the bones were ground up, and there is no piece k'Se'orah.</p>
<p class="bas subject"><span class="nm">4)</span>A LIMB LACKING FLESH</p>
<p class="bas indent1"><span class="nm">(a)</span><span class="cl">(Mishnah):</span> (He shaves) due to a limb from a Mes or a limb from a Chai that has enough flesh on it to sustain it (if it were attached to a Chai).</p>
<p class="bas indent1"><span class="nm">(b)</span><span class="cl">Question:</span> What is the law if it lacks this amount of flesh?</p>
<p class="bas indent1"><span class="nm">(c)</span><span class="cl">Answer #1 (R. Yochanan):</span> A Nazir does not shave for it.</p>
<p class="bas indent1"><span class="nm">(d)</span><span class="cl">Answer #2 (Reish Lakish):</span> A Nazir shaves for it.</p>
<p class="bas indent2"><span class="nm">1.</span>R. Yochanan learns from our Mishnah. It says that he shaves only if it has sufficient flesh!</p>
<p class="bas indent2"><span class="nm">2.</span>Reish Lakish learns from the fact that it is not listed in the Seifa (the next Mishnah, 54a) among things for which a Nazir does not shave.</p>
<p class="bas indent2"><span class="nm">3.</span>R. Yochanan says that this is no proof. Anything that can be inferred from the Reisha is not taught in the Seifa.</p>
<p class="bas indent2"><span class="nm">4.</span><span class="cl">Objection #1:</span> Our Mishnah teaches a half Kav of bones, implying that he does not shave for a quarter Kav, yet the Seifa teaches about a quarter Kav!</p>
<p class="bas indent2"><span class="nm">5.</span><span class="cl">Answer:</span> A quarter Kav needed to be taught. If not, one might have thought that he does not shave even for touching or moving them;</p>
<p class="bas indent3"><span class="nm">i.</span>The Seifa teaches that the exemption is only for Tum'as Ohel of them.</p>
<p class="bas indent2"><span class="nm">6.</span><span class="cl">Objection #2:</span> The Reisha teaches about a half Log of blood, implying that he does not shave for a quarter Log, yet the Seifa teaches about a quarter Log!</p>
<p class="bas indent2"><span class="nm">7.</span><span class="cl">Answer:</span> A quarter Log was taught to oppose R. Akiva, who says that a Nazir shaves for touching or moving it.</p>
<p class="bas indent1"><span class="nm">(e)</span><span class="cl">Question:</span> What is the case of a limb from a Mes that R. Yochanan and Reish Lakish argue about?</p>
<p class="bas indent2"><span class="nm">1.</span>If it contains a bone k'Se'orah, why does R. Yochanan say that he does not shave for it?</p>
<p class="bas indent2"><span class="nm">2.</span>If it does not have a bone k'Se'orah, why does Reish Lakish say that he shaves for it?</p>
<p class="bas indent1"><span class="nm">(f)</span><span class="cl">Answer:</span> Really, it has no bone k'Se'orah. Reish Lakish holds that even so, the Torah says that he shaves for it:</p>
<p class="bas indent2"><span class="nm">1.</span><span class="cl">Beraisa:</span> It says "anyone who will touch on the face of the field, a body killed by a sword, or a Mes (becomes Tamei)." "On the face of the field" teaches about one who towers above a Mes;</p>
<p class="bas indent2"><span class="nm">2.</span>"A body killed" teaches about a limb from a Chai with sufficient flesh;</p>
<p class="bas indent2"><span class="nm">3.</span>"A sword " teaches that a sword that killed a person is Tamei just like a Mes;</p>
<p class="bas indent2"><span class="nm">4.</span>"Or a Mes" teaches about a limb that became detached from a Mes;</p>
<p class="bas indent2"><span class="nm">5.</span>"Or a bone of a man" teaches about a quarter Kav of bones;</p>
<p class="bas indent2"><span class="nm">6.</span>"Or a grave" teaches about a sealed coffin;</p>
<p class="bas indent3"><span class="nm">i.</span>We learned that a sealed coffin is Metamei anything above or below it.</p>
