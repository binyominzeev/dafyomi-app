<p class="bas subject"><span class="nm">1)</span>OILS FORBIDDEN EVEN DURING THE WEEK</p>
<p class="bas indent1"><span class="nm">(a)</span><span class="cl">(Beraisa - R. Shimon ben Elazar):</span> One may not light with Tzari (balsam sap).</p>
<p class="bas indent1"><span class="nm">(b)</span><span class="cl">Question:</span> What is the reason?</p>
<p class="bas indent1"><span class="nm">(c)</span><span class="cl">Answer (Rabah):</span> Since it smells nice (it is one of the ingredients in the Ketores), we decree lest he will take some of the sap [and be liable for extinguishing].</p>
<p class="bas indent1"><span class="nm">(d)</span><span class="cl">Question (Abaye):</span> You should say that it is forbidden for it flies (Rashi - it is dangerous, it may burn the house; Tosfos - one may come to extinguish)!</p>
<p class="bas indent1"><span class="nm">(e)</span><span class="cl">Answer (Rabah):</span> I agree that it is forbidden because it flies - I add, we also decree lest he will take some of the sap.</p>
<p class="bas indent1"><span class="nm">(f)</span>There was a mother-in-law who hated her daughter-in-law; she told her to anoint with balsam oil, and to light a lamp. The daughter-in-law did so; she was consumed in fire.</p>
<p class="bas indent1"><span class="nm">(g)</span><span class="cl">(Rav Yosef - Beraisa):</span> "Umi'Dalos ha'Aretz Hish'ir Nevuzaradan...l'Chomrim ul'Yogvim" - Chomrim are people who collect balsam from Ein Gedi to Ramot;</p>
<p class="bas indent1"><span class="nm">(h)</span>Yogvim are people who hunt for the Chilazon from the hill of Tzur to Chaifah. (It seems that this is not the fish from whose blood we make Techeiles for Tzitzis. See Yad Ramah Sanhedrin 91a DH Amar.)</p>
<p class="bas indent1"><span class="nm">(i)</span><span class="cl">(Beraisa):</span> One may not light with Tamei Tevel (untithed produce) on Chol, there is no need to say it is forbidden on Shabbos;</p>
<p class="bas indent1"><span class="nm">(j)</span>Similarly - one may not light with white kerosene on Chol, there is no need to say it is forbidden on Shabbos.</p>
<p class="bas indent1"><span class="nm">(k)</span><span class="cl">Question:</span> We understand why white kerosene is forbidden - it flies;</p>
<p class="bas indent2"><span class="nm">1.</span>Why is Tamei Tevel forbidden?</p>
<p class="bas indent1"><span class="nm">(l)</span><span class="cl">Answer:</span> "...Mishmeres Terumosai" - the verse discusses two Terumos, Tahor and Tamei;</p>
<p class="bas indent2"><span class="nm">1.</span>Just like you may not benefit (eat) from Tahor Terumah before separating it (it is Tevel), you may not benefit (e.g. burn) from Tamei Terumah before separating it.</p>
<p class="bas subject"><span class="nm">2)</span>OILS FORBIDDEN TO BE USED ON SHABBOS</p>
<p class="bas indent1"><span class="nm">(a)</span><span class="cl">(Beraisa - R. Shimon ben Elazar):</span> One may not light with Tzari - this is balsam sap.</p>
<p class="bas indent1"><span class="nm">(b)</span>R. Yishmael says, one may not light with anything that comes from a tree.</p>
<p class="bas indent1"><span class="nm">(c)</span>R. Yishmael ben Brokah says, one may light only with things that come from produce.</p>
<p class="bas indent1"><span class="nm">(d)</span>R. Tarfon says, only olive oil may be used.</p>
<p class="bas indent1"><span class="nm">(e)</span><span class="cl">R. Yochanan ben Nuri:</span> [This is unreasonable -] what will people in Bavel do, they have only sesame oil! People in Madai, Alexandria and Kaputkia have (respectively) only nut oil, radish oil and kerosene!</p>
<p class="bas indent2"><span class="nm">1.</span>One may light with anything Chachamim did not forbid.</p>
<p class="bas indent1"><span class="nm">(f)</span>One may light with fish oil or tar;</p>
<p class="bas indent1"><span class="nm">(g)</span>R. Shimon Shezuri permits wild gourd and kerosene;</p>
<p class="bas indent1"><span class="nm">(h)</span>Sumchus says, the only thing that comes from flesh that one may light with is fish oil.</p>
<p class="bas indent1"><span class="nm">(i)</span><span class="cl">Question:</span> Sumchus does not argue with the first Tana!</p>
<p class="bas indent1"><span class="nm">(j)</span><span class="cl">Answer:</span> They argue about Rav Beruna's law (that one may put a drop of good oil into melted Chelev or fish innards and light with it) - we cannot determine which holds like Rav Beruna and which argues.</p>
<p class="bas subject"><span class="nm">3)</span>WHICH GARMENTS CAN BECOME <i>TAMEI</i> THROUGH <i>TZARA'AS</i></p>
<p class="bas indent1"><span class="nm">(a)</span><span class="cl">(Beraisa - R. Shimon ben Elazar):</span> A garment of [at least] three fingers by three fingers of any material derived from a tree is not Mekabel Tum'ah, unless it is of linen;</p>
<p class="bas indent2"><span class="nm">1.</span>Any tree derivative may be used for Sechach (the roof of a Sukah), except for linen.</p>
<p class="bas bbbline">26b----------------------------------------26b</p>
<p class="bas indent1"><span class="nm">(b)</span><span class="cl">(Abaye):</span> R. Shimon ben Elazar and Tana d'vei R. Yishmael agree with each other.</p>
<p class="bas indent2"><span class="nm">1.</span><span class="cl">(Tana d'vei R. Yishmael - Beraisa):</span> The Torah often says 'Beged' without specifying; in one place, it specified 'Tzemer u'Pishtim' - in all places, it refers to wool or linen.</p>
<p class="bas indent1"><span class="nm">(c)</span><span class="cl">(Rava):</span> They argue regarding garments of other materials that are three Tefachim by three Tefachim - R. Shimon ben Elazar says that they Mekabel Tum'ah, Tana d'vei R. Yishmael says they do not.</p>
<p class="bas indent1"><span class="nm">(d)</span><span class="cl">Question:</span> All agree that three by three fingers of wool or linen can receive [Tum'as] Tzara'as - from where do they learn this?</p>
<p class="bas indent1"><span class="nm">(e)</span><span class="cl">Answer (Beraisa):</span> 'Beged' only teaches that a [full] garment can receive Tzara'as;</p>
<p class="bas indent2"><span class="nm">1.</span><span class="cl">Question:</span> What is the source for even three by three fingers?</p>
<p class="bas indent2"><span class="nm">2.</span><span class="cl">Answer:</span> "<i>Veha</i>'Beged" includes this.</p>
<p class="bas indent2"><span class="nm">3.</span><span class="cl">Suggestion:</span> Perhaps it comes to include three Tefachim by three Tefachim!</p>
<p class="bas indent2"><span class="nm">4.</span>Rejection We know that from a Kal va'Chomer - even warp and woof threads receive Tzara'as, all the more so three by three Tefachim!</p>
<p class="bas indent2"><span class="nm">5.</span><span class="cl">Question:</span> The same Kal va'Chomer should teach that three by three fingers receives Tzara'as!</p>
<p class="bas indent2"><span class="nm">6.</span><span class="cl">Answer:</span> The Kal va'Chomer only teaches three by three Tefachim, for fabric this size is fitting for rich and poor alike;</p>
<p class="bas indent3"><span class="nm">i.</span>It does not teach three by three fingers, for such pieces are fitting only for poor people; we learn three by three fingers only from the verse.</p>
<p class="bas indent2"><span class="nm">7.</span><span class="cl">Question:</span> Why not say that "<i>Veha</i>'Beged" includes three Tefachim by three Tefachim of garments of other materials!</p>
<p class="bas indent2"><span class="nm">8.</span><span class="cl">Answer:</span> "V'Beged Tzemer O b'Veged Pishtim" - wool and linen, nothing else.</p>
<p class="bas indent2"><span class="nm">9.</span><span class="cl">Question:</span> Perhaps that only excludes three fingers by three fingers (of other garments), but we learn three Tefachim by three Tefachim from Veha'Beged"!</p>
<p class="bas indent2"><span class="nm">10.</span><span class="cl">Answer:</span> There are two verses to exclude other garments - [the above verse and] "Beged ha'Tzemer O ha'Pishtim";</p>
<p class="bas indent3"><span class="nm">i.</span>One verse excludes three fingers by three fingers, the other excludes three Tefachim by three Tefachim.</p>
