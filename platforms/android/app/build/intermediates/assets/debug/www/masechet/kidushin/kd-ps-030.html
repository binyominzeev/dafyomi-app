<p class="bas subject"><span class="nm">1)</span>WHEN TO GET MARRIED (cont.)</p>
<p class="bas indent1"><span class="nm">(a)</span><span class="cl">Version #1 (Rava):</span> While your son will accept your rebuke, marry him off. This is from 16 until 22.</p>
<p class="bas indent1"><span class="nm">(b)</span><span class="cl">Version #2 (Rava):</span> The proper time is from 18 until 24.</p>
<p class="bas indent1"><span class="nm">(c)</span>These versions are like the following Tana'im:</p>
<p class="bas indent2"><span class="nm">1.</span><span class="cl">(Beraisa - Rebbi Yehudah or R. Nechemyah):</span> "Train a youth according to his way" is from 16 until 22 (he is a youth, and will accept your training);</p>
<p class="bas indent2"><span class="nm">2.</span><span class="cl">(The other of Rebbi Yehudah and R. Nechemyah):</span> This is from 18 until 24.</p>
<p class="bas subject"><span class="nm">2)</span>TEACHING TORAH TO ONE'S SON</p>
<p class="bas indent1"><span class="nm">(a)</span><span class="cl">Question:</span> What is the extent of the obligation to teach Torah to one's son?</p>
<p class="bas indent1"><span class="nm">(b)</span><span class="cl">Answer (Rav Yehudah):</span> It is like the case of Zevulun ben Dan. His grandfather taught him written Torah, Mishnah, Gemara, Halachos and Agados.</p>
<p class="bas indent1"><span class="nm">(c)</span><span class="cl">Question (Beraisa):</span> One must teach one's son written Torah. He need not teach him Mishnah!</p>
<p class="bas indent1"><span class="nm">(d)</span><span class="cl">Answer:</span> The obligation extends as many generations as the case of Zevulun ben Dan, whose grandfather taught him;</p>
<p class="bas indent2"><span class="nm">1.</span>One need not teach as much as Zevulun ben Dan was taught. Written Torah is enough.</p>
<p class="bas indent1"><span class="nm">(e)</span><span class="cl">Question:</span> Is a grandfather really obligated?!</p>
<p class="bas indent2"><span class="nm">1.</span><span class="cl">(Beraisa):</span> "You will teach your sons", not your grandsons;</p>
<p class="bas indent2"><span class="nm">2.</span><span class="cl">Question:</span> "You will make known to your sons and grandsons"!</p>
<p class="bas indent2"><span class="nm">3.</span><span class="cl">Answer:</span> This teaches that if one teaches his son Torah, it is considered as if he taught also his grandsons and all future generations.</p>
<p class="bas indent1"><span class="nm">(f)</span><span class="cl">Answer:</span> Rav Yehudah holds like the following Tana.</p>
<p class="bas indent2"><span class="nm">1.</span><span class="cl">(Beraisa) Question:</span> It says "you will teach your sons." What is the source for grandsons?</p>
<p class="bas indent2"><span class="nm">2.</span><span class="cl">Answer:</span> "You will make known to your sons and grandsons"!</p>
<p class="bas indent2"><span class="nm">3.</span><span class="cl">Question:</span> If so, why does it say "you will teach your sons" (implying only your sons)?</p>
<p class="bas indent2"><span class="nm">4.</span><span class="cl">Answer:</span> That teaches that one need not teach his daughters.</p>
<p class="bas indent1"><span class="nm">(g)</span><span class="cl">(R. Yehoshua ben Levi):</span> If one teaches his grandson Torah, it is considered as if he received it from Sinai - "you will make known to your sons and grandsons... the day that you stood in front of Hash-m on Sinai."</p>
<p class="bas indent1"><span class="nm">(h)</span>R. Yehoshua ben Levi put a sheet on his head and was taking his son to learn.</p>
<p class="bas indent2"><span class="nm">1.</span><span class="cl">R. Chiya bar Aba:</span> Why didn't you cover your head in a more dignified manner?</p>
<p class="bas indent2"><span class="nm">2.</span><span class="cl">R. Yehoshua ben Levi:</span> (I did not want to lose time.) This is no light matter - "you will make known to your sons and grandsons... the day that you stood in front of Hash-m on Sinai"!</p>
<p class="bas indent1"><span class="nm">(i)</span>From that day, R. Chiya bar Aba would not eat each morning until he reviewed with his son his learning (of the previous day) and taught him more.</p>
<p class="bas indent1"><span class="nm">(j)</span>Rabah bar Rav Huna would not eat each morning until he brought his son to learn.</p>
<p class="bas indent1"><span class="nm">(k)</span><span class="cl">(Rav Safra):</span> "V'Shinantam (you will teach them) to your sons" - since it did not say "v'Shanisam", we expound this to say v'Shilashtam (you will divide in thirds);</p>
<p class="bas indent2"><span class="nm">1.</span>One should divide his years in three. One third he should learn written Torah, one third Mishnah, and one third Gemara.</p>
<p class="bas indent2"><span class="nm">2.</span><span class="cl">Objection:</span> One does not know how many years he will live!</p>
<p class="bas indent2"><span class="nm">3.</span><span class="cl">Answer:</span> He should divide the days of each week among these three (Rashi; Tosfos - each day, he should learn all three).</p>
<p class="bas subject"><span class="nm">3)</span>COUNTING LETTERS AND VERSES</p>
<p class="bas indent1"><span class="nm">(a)</span>The early Chachamim were called Sofrim (counters), for they would count all letters of the Torah:</p>
<p class="bas indent2"><span class="nm">1.</span>The Vav of "Gachon" is the middle letter (of the large and small letters) of the Torah;</p>
<p class="bas indent2"><span class="nm">2.</span>"Darash Darash" are the middle words;</p>
<p class="bas indent2"><span class="nm">3.</span>"V'Hisgalach" is the middle verse;</p>
<p class="bas indent2"><span class="nm">4.</span>The Ayin of "mi'Ya'ar" is the middle letter of Tehilim.</p>
<p class="bas indent2"><span class="nm">5.</span>"V'Hu Rachum" is the middle verse of Tehilim.</p>
<p class="bas indent1"><span class="nm">(b)</span><span class="cl">Question (Rav Yosef):</span> Is the Vav of Gachon the first of the two letters in the middle, or the second?</p>
<p class="bas indent2"><span class="nm">1.</span><span class="cl">Rabanan:</span> Let's take out a Sefer Torah and count. Rabah bar bar Chanah said that they did so for a similar question!</p>
<p class="bas indent2"><span class="nm">2.</span><span class="cl">Rav Yosef:</span> They knew all the extra and missing letters. We do not.</p>
<p class="bas indent1"><span class="nm">(c)</span><span class="cl">Question (Rav Yosef):</span> Is "v'Hisgalach" the first of the two middle verses, or the second?</p>
<p class="bas indent2"><span class="nm">1.</span><span class="cl">Abaye:</span> This we can count!</p>
<p class="bas indent2"><span class="nm">2.</span><span class="cl">Rav Yosef:</span> Here also we are unsure! In Eretz Yisrael, they consider "Hash-m said... I will come to you in the cloud" to be three verses!</p>
<p class="bas indent1"><span class="nm">(d)</span><span class="cl">(Beraisa):</span> There are 5,888 verses in the Torah. Tehilim has eight additional verses, Divrei ha'Yamim lacks eight verses. (Tosfos cannot fathom how there can be so many verses in Tehilim. It seems that Tehilim and Divrei ha'Yamim each have about a third as many verses as this. Ha'Mikra veha'Mesorah (pp.34-37) says that Moshe Rabeinu composed many praises of Hash-m, and chronicles. Eight verses of his praises (in Shiras ha'Yam) were included in the Torah. The last eight verses of the Torah (that are after Moshe's death), which Moshe did not write in their final form, are not included in the number of verses of the Torah.)</p>
<p class="bas subject"><span class="nm">4)</span>HOW ONE SHOULD LEARN</p>
<p class="bas indent1"><span class="nm">(a)</span><span class="cl">(Beraisa):</span> "V'Shinantam (you will repeat them)" - (you should review until) words of Torah are sharp in your mouth, so if you are asked, you can respond immediately.</p>
<p class="bas bbbline">30b----------------------------------------30b</p>
<p class="bas indent2"><span class="nm">1.</span>"Say to Chachmah, you are my sister" (Torah should be as clear to you as (the Isur to marry) your sister.</p>
<p class="bas indent1"><span class="nm">(b)</span><span class="cl">(R. Chiya bar Aba):</span> "When they speak with enemies in the gate" - even a father and son, or a Rebbi and Talmid, when they engage in Torah, they become enemies;</p>
<p class="bas indent2"><span class="nm">1.</span>"Es v'Hav b'Sufah" - in the Sof (end), they will love each other.</p>
<p class="bas indent1"><span class="nm">(c)</span><span class="cl">(Beraisa):</span> "V'Samtem (you will put them)" - Torah is compared to a Sam Tam (a pure potion) of life;</p>
<p class="bas indent2"><span class="nm">1.</span>This is like a man who severely wounded his son. He put a bandage on the wound and told him 'as long as the bandage is on, you may eat and bathe like you desire. If you remove the bandage, blisters will sprout.</p>
<p class="bas indent2"><span class="nm">2.</span>Hash-m told Yisrael similarly. I created the Yetzer Ra (evil inclination), and I created the Torah to fix it;'</p>
<p class="bas indent3"><span class="nm">i.</span>If you engage in Torah, it will not overcome you - "if you will improve, you will rise";</p>
<p class="bas indent3"><span class="nm">ii.</span>If you do not engage in Torah, it will overcome you - "sin crouches at the opening."</p>
<p class="bas indent3"><span class="nm">iii.</span>Further, the Yetzer Ra will be wholly dedicated to make you stumble - "your desire is to it";</p>
<p class="bas indent3"><span class="nm">iv.</span>If you want, you can rule over it - "you will rule over it."</p>
<p class="bas indent1"><span class="nm">(d)</span><span class="cl">(Beraisa):</span> The Yetzer Ra is very harsh. Even Hash-m calls it evil! "The Yetzer of man's heart is evil from his youth".</p>
<p class="bas indent1"><span class="nm">(e)</span><span class="cl">(R. Yitzchak):</span> A man's Yetzer renews itself every day - "just evil the entire day."</p>
<p class="bas indent1"><span class="nm">(f)</span><span class="cl">(R. Yehoshua ben Levi):</span> A man's Yetzer overpowers him every day and seeks to destroy him - "the evil one waits for the Tzadik and seeks to kill him";</p>
<p class="bas indent2"><span class="nm">1.</span>Without Hash-m's help, the Tzadik could not prevail - "Hash-m will not abandon (the Tzadik and let him fall) into its hands."</p>
<p class="bas indent1"><span class="nm">(g)</span><span class="cl">Beraisa (Tana d'Vei R. Yishmael):</span> If this disgusting one (the Yetzer Ra) encounters you, drag it to the Beis Medrash;</p>
<p class="bas indent2"><span class="nm">1.</span>If it is stone, it will melt. If it is iron, it will shatter (some texts - if it is iron, he will melt. If it is stone, it will shatter.)</p>
<p class="bas subject"><span class="nm">5)</span>OTHER MITZVOS PERFORMED UPON A SON</p>
<p class="bas indent1"><span class="nm">(a)</span><span class="cl">(Beraisa):</span> It is a Mitzvah to marry him to a woman.</p>
<p class="bas indent1"><span class="nm">(b)</span><span class="cl">Question:</span> What is the source for this?</p>
<p class="bas indent1"><span class="nm">(c)</span><span class="cl">Answer:</span> "Take wives and bear sons and daughters. Take wives for your sons, and give your daughters to men."</p>
<p class="bas indent1"><span class="nm">(d)</span><span class="cl">Question:</span> Granted, a man can find a wife for his son;</p>
<p class="bas indent2"><span class="nm">1.</span>Can a man always find a husband for his daughter?</p>
<p class="bas indent1"><span class="nm">(e)</span><span class="cl">Answer:</span> He can give her clothing and property, so men will be eager to marry her.</p>
<p class="bas indent1"><span class="nm">(f)</span><span class="cl">(Beraisa):</span> He must teach him a trade.</p>
<p class="bas indent1"><span class="nm">(g)</span><span class="cl">Question:</span> What is the source for this?</p>
<p class="bas indent1"><span class="nm">(h)</span><span class="cl">Answer (Chizkiyah):</span> "See life with the woman whom you love";</p>
<p class="bas indent2"><span class="nm">1.</span>The 'woman' referred literally means a wife, or, it alludes to Torah.</p>
<p class="bas indent2"><span class="nm">2.</span>In either case, just like it is a Mitzvah to take a wife for one's son or to teach him Torah, it is also a Mitzvah to teach him a livelihood.</p>
<p class="bas indent1"><span class="nm">(i)</span><span class="cl">(Beraisa):</span> Some say, it is a Mitzvah even to teach him to swim.</p>
<p class="bas indent1"><span class="nm">(j)</span>This may save his life.</p>
<p class="bas indent1"><span class="nm">(k)</span><span class="cl">(Beraisa):</span> Rebbi Yehudah says, whoever does not teach his son a trade, he teaches him robbery.</p>
<p class="bas indent1"><span class="nm">(l)</span><span class="cl">Question:</span> This cannot be!</p>
<p class="bas indent1"><span class="nm">(m)</span><span class="cl">Answer:</span> Rather, it is as if he teaches him robbery.</p>
<p class="bas indent1"><span class="nm">(n)</span><span class="cl">Question:</span> The first Tana also said he must teach him a trade. What do they argue about?</p>
<p class="bas indent1"><span class="nm">(o)</span><span class="cl">Answer:</span> The first Tana says that it suffices to teach the son business. Rebbi Yehudah says, he must teach him a trade.</p>
<p class="bas subject"><span class="nm">6)</span>MITZVOS THAT A SON MUST DO FOR HIS FATHER</p>
<p class="bas indent1"><span class="nm">(a)</span><span class="cl">(Mishnah):</span> Every Mitzvah of the father on the son (is obligatory for men and women).</p>
<p class="bas indent1"><span class="nm">(b)</span><span class="cl">Question:</span> What does this mean?</p>
<p class="bas indent2"><span class="nm">1.</span><span class="cl">Suggestion:</span> It refers to Mitzvos that the father must perform on his son.</p>
<p class="bas indent2"><span class="nm">2.</span><span class="cl">Rejection (Beraisa):</span> A father is commanded to circumcise his son and redeem his firstborn son. A mother is exempt!</p>
<p class="bas indent1"><span class="nm">(c)</span><span class="cl">Answer (Rav Yehudah):</span> Rather, every Mitzvah incumbent on the son to do for the father, is obligatory for both men and women.</p>
<p class="bas indent2"><span class="nm">1.</span><span class="cl">(Beraisa):</span> "A man (will fear his mother and father)" obligates only a man. "Tira'u (you (plural) will fear)" obligates also a woman.</p>
<p class="bas indent2"><span class="nm">2.</span><span class="cl">Question:</span> If so, why does it say "a man"?</p>
<p class="bas indent2"><span class="nm">3.</span><span class="cl">Answer:</span> A man is able to fulfill the Mitzvah. A (married) woman cannot (because she must be by her husband).</p>
<p class="bas indent1"><span class="nm">(d)</span><span class="cl">(Rav Idi bar Avin):</span> If a woman is divorced, she is obligated (to honor and fear parents) just like a man.</p>
<p class="bas indent1"><span class="nm">(e)</span><span class="cl">(Beraisa):</span> It says "honor your father and mother", and "honor Hash-m from your wealth";</p>
<p class="bas indent2"><span class="nm">1.</span>The Torah equates the honor of parents with honor of Hash-m.</p>
<p class="bas indent1"><span class="nm">(f)</span>It says "a man will fear his mother and father", and "you will fear Hash-m and serve Him";</p>
<p class="bas indent2"><span class="nm">1.</span>The Torah equates fear of parents with fear of Hash-m.</p>
<p class="bas indent1"><span class="nm">(g)</span>It says "a man who will curse his father and (i.e. or) mother will die", and "a man who will curse Hash-m will bear his sin";</p>
<p class="bas indent2"><span class="nm">1.</span>The Torah equates cursing parents to cursing Hash-m.</p>
<p class="bas indent3"><span class="nm">i.</span>We cannot equate them regarding hitting, for this does not apply to Hash-m!</p>
<p class="bas indent2"><span class="nm">2.</span>It is fitting that obligations to parents parallel obligations to Hash-m, for all three were partners in the child's creation.</p>
<p class="bas indent1"><span class="nm">(h)</span><span class="cl">(Beraisa):</span> There are three partners in creation of a child: Hash-m, the father, and the mother.</p>
<p class="bas indent2"><span class="nm">1.</span>When a child honors his parent, Hash-m considers it as if He dwelled among them and they honored Him.</p>
<p class="bas indent1"><span class="nm">(i)</span><span class="cl">(Rebbi):</span> Hash-m knows that a child honors his mother more than his father because she entices him (with food), therefore, He commanded to honor the father before the mother;</p>
<p class="bas indent1"><span class="nm">(j)</span>Hash-m knows that a child fears his father more than his mother because his father teaches him Torah. Therefore, He commanded to honor the mother before the father.</p>
