<p class="bas subject"><span class="nm">1)</span>ANOTHER LAW LEARNED FROM <i>IM</i> <i>HIMATZEI</i> <i>SIMATZEI</i></p>
<p class="bas indent1"><span class="nm">(a)</span><span class="cl">Question:</span> We need "Im Himatzei Simatzei" for another teaching!</p>
<p class="bas indent2"><span class="nm">1.</span><span class="cl">(Beraisa) Question:</span> "(If it will be found in) his hand (he pays two)." What is the source that he pays Kefel even if it is found on his roof or yard?</p>
<p class="bas indent2"><span class="nm">2.</span><span class="cl">Answer:</span> "Im Himatzei Simatzei" - in any place.</p>
<p class="bas indent1"><span class="nm">(b)</span><span class="cl">Answer:</span> Had it written the same word twice, 'Himatzei Himatzei' or 'Simatzei Simatzei', we would only learn one law;</p>
<p class="bas indent2"><span class="nm">1.</span>Since the Torah switched, we learn two laws.</p>
<p class="bas subject"><span class="nm">2)</span>RESUSCITATING THE PRINCIPAL</p>
<p class="bas indent1"><span class="nm">(a)</span><span class="cl">(Rav):</span> A thief pays principal like the value at the time he stole it. The additional payments (of Kefel, four or five) are like the value at the time of the trial.</p>
<p class="bas indent1"><span class="nm">(b)</span><span class="cl">Question:</span> What is the reason?</p>
<p class="bas indent2"><span class="nm">1.</span><span class="cl">Answer:</span> It says "theft" and "living" - the thief must resuscitate what he stole like when he stole it.</p>
<p class="bas indent1"><span class="nm">(c)</span><span class="cl">Question (Rav Sheshes - Beraisa):</span> If a thief stole an animal and fattened it, he pays Kefel, four or five like at the time he stole.</p>
<p class="bas indent1"><span class="nm">(d)</span><span class="cl">Answer:</span> Since the thief fattened the animal, it is not reasonable that he should pay extra for this.</p>
<p class="bas indent1"><span class="nm">(e)</span><span class="cl">Question (Beraisa):</span> If a thief stole a fat animal and weakened it, he pays Kefel, four or five like at the time he stole.</p>
<p class="bas indent1"><span class="nm">(f)</span><span class="cl">Answer:</span> Weakening the animal is like partially killing it (it is not reasonable that he should pay less for this).</p>
<p class="bas indent1"><span class="nm">(g)</span>Rav's law applies when the price of animals changed.</p>
<p class="bas indent1"><span class="nm">(h)</span><span class="cl">Question:</span> What is the case?</p>
<p class="bas indent2"><span class="nm">1.</span><span class="cl">Suggestion:</span> It was worth one (Zuz) when he stole it, and four later (at the time of the trial). Rav argues with Rabah!</p>
<p class="bas indent3"><span class="nm">i.</span><span class="cl">(Rabah):</span> If Reuven stole a barrel of wine worth one Zuz, and later, the price went up to four, and he broke it or drank it, he pays four. If it broke by itself, he pays one.</p>
<p class="bas indent1"><span class="nm">(i)</span><span class="cl">Answer:</span> (Rav does not argue.) Rav discusses when it was worth four when he stole it, and one later.</p>
<p class="bas indent2"><span class="nm">1.</span>He pays four for principal, and payments of Kefel, four and five are based on the final value (one).</p>
<p class="bas subject"><span class="nm">3)</span>THE ADDED FIFTH</p>
<p class="bas indent1"><span class="nm">(a)</span><span class="cl">Support (for Rav - R. Chanina - Beraisa):</span> If a Shomer claimed that the deposit was stolen, and he swore falsely, admitted that he lied, and witnesses testified that the Shomer himself took it:</p>
<p class="bas indent2"><span class="nm">1.</span>If he admitted before witnesses came, he pays principal, Chomesh, and brings an Asham;</p>
<p class="bas indent2"><span class="nm">2.</span>R. Yakov says, if he admitted after witnesses came, he pays Kefel and brings an Asham. The extra payment (of Kefel) counts for Chomesh.</p>
<p class="bas bbbline">65b----------------------------------------65b</p>
<p class="bas indent2"><span class="nm">3.</span>Chachamim say, "b'Rosho va'Chamishisav" teaches that one adds a Chomesh only when he pays b'Rosho (principal, but not when he pays Kefel).</p>
<p class="bas indent2"><span class="nm">4.</span>R. Shimon bar Yochai says, Chomesh and Asham do not apply when Kefel is paid.</p>
<p class="bas indent2"><span class="nm">5.</span><span class="cl">Question:</span> R. Yakov said that the Kefel counts for Chomesh. What is the case?</p>
<p class="bas indent3"><span class="nm">i.</span>If the deposit was worth four from beginning to end, the Kefel is four, but the Chomesh is only one!</p>
<p class="bas indent2"><span class="nm">6.</span><span class="cl">Answer:</span> Rather, it was worth four when he stole it, and one at the end. The Kefel is one, and so is the Chomesh!</p>
<p class="bas indent2"><span class="nm">7.</span>This shows that the principal is paid like the initial price (the Chomesh is a quarter of the principal), and Kefel are like the final price!</p>
<p class="bas indent1"><span class="nm">(b)</span><span class="cl">Rejection (Rava):</span> Really, it was worth four from beginning to end. The case is, he swore four times, so the Kefel equals the (four) added fifths!</p>
<p class="bas indent2"><span class="nm">1.</span>"Va'Chamishisav (and its fifths)" teaches that many fifths can be paid for one principal.</p>
<p class="bas indent1"><span class="nm">(c)</span>(Beraisa - Chachamim) "B'Rosho va'Chamishisav" teaches that one adds a fifth when paying (only) principal (but he brings an Asham).</p>
<p class="bas indent1"><span class="nm">(d)</span><span class="cl">Question:</span> The same reason he is exempt from the Choleh should also exempt from the Asham - " b'Rosho va'Chamishisav v'Es Ashamo"!</p>
<p class="bas indent1"><span class="nm">(e)</span><span class="cl">Answer:</span> Chachamim hold that the word "Es" separates (Asham does not depend on paying only principal);</p>
<p class="bas indent2"><span class="nm">1.</span>R. Shimon holds that the Vav (in v'Es) connects (so also Asham depends on paying only principal).</p>
<p class="bas indent2"><span class="nm">2.</span><span class="cl">Chachamim:</span> If so, the Torah should have omitted the entire word 'v'Es'!</p>
<p class="bas indent2"><span class="nm">3.</span><span class="cl">R. Shimon:</span> It must be written to separate between money paid to a person (the Chomesh) and what goes to Hash-m (the Asham).</p>
<p class="bas subject"><span class="nm">4)</span>AN ANIMAL THAT CHANGED</p>
<p class="bas indent1"><span class="nm">(a)</span><span class="cl">(R. Ila'i):</span> If a man stole a lamb or calf, and it grew up and became a ram or ox, this is a change, and he acquires it (but he owes its value);</p>
<p class="bas indent2"><span class="nm">1.</span>If he slaughters or sells it, he slaughters or sells his own animal.</p>
<p class="bas indent1"><span class="nm">(b)</span><span class="cl">Question (R. Chanina - Beraisa):</span> If a man stole a lamb, and it grew up and became a ram or ox, he pays Kefel, four or five as at the time of the theft.</p>
<p class="bas indent2"><span class="nm">1.</span>If he acquires it through the change, he should not pay four or five, for he slaughters or sells his own animal!</p>
<p class="bas indent2"><span class="nm">2.</span><span class="cl">Counter-question: (R. Ilai):</span> If he does not acquire, why does he pay like the time of the theft? He should pay like now!</p>
<p class="bas indent2"><span class="nm">3.</span><span class="cl">Answer (R. Chanina):</span> He does not pay like now, because he stole a lamb, not a ram!</p>
<p class="bas indent1"><span class="nm">(c)</span><span class="cl">Question (R. Zeira):</span> He should acquire because the stolen item has a new name!</p>
<p class="bas indent1"><span class="nm">(d)</span><span class="cl">Answer (Rava):</span> A one-day old ox is also called an ox.</p>
<p class="bas indent2"><span class="nm">1.</span>We learn from "an ox... that will be born".</p>
<p class="bas indent2"><span class="nm">2.</span>The same applies to rams. Yakov said "the rams of your flock I did not eat." Surely, he did not eat Lavan's lambs!</p>
<p class="bas indent1"><span class="nm">(e)</span>Question (b) has still not been answered!</p>
<p class="bas indent1"><span class="nm">(f)</span><span class="cl">Answer (Rav Sheshes):</span> The Beraisa is like Beis Shamai, who say that one does not acquire through a change.</p>
<p class="bas indent2"><span class="nm">1.</span><span class="cl">(Beraisa #1):</span> If a man paid a harlot with wheat, olives or grapes, and she made them into flour, oil or wine, they may not be offered on the Mizbe'ach (they are still considered her wages);</p>
<p class="bas indent2"><span class="nm">2.</span><span class="cl">(Beraisa #2):</span> They may be offered.</p>
<p class="bas indent1"><span class="nm">(g)</span><span class="cl">(Rav Yosef - Beraisa):</span> Beis Shamai forbid;</p>
<p class="bas indent1"><span class="nm">(h)</span>Beis Hillel permit.</p>
<p class="bas indent1"><span class="nm">(i)</span><span class="cl">Question:</span> Why do Beis Shamai forbid?</p>
<p class="bas indent1"><span class="nm">(j)</span><span class="cl">Answer:</span> The verse (that disqualifies a harlot's wages or something traded for a dog for a Korban) says "also", to include what they are transformed into.</p>
