<p class="bas subject"><span class="nm">1)</span>MISHNAH: MUSAF OF ROSH HASHANAH</p>
<p class="bas indent1"><span class="nm">(a)</span><span class="cl">(R. Yochanan ben Nuri):</span> In Musaf of Rosh Hashanah, one says Avos, Gevuros, Kedushas Hash-m, including Malchuyos, but not blowing the Shofar.</p>
<p class="bas indent2"><span class="nm">1.</span>Then Kedushas ha'Yom and blowing Shofar,</p>
<p class="bas indent2"><span class="nm">2.</span>Then Zichronos and blowing Shofar,</p>
<p class="bas indent2"><span class="nm">3.</span>Then Shofros and blowing Shofar,</p>
<p class="bas indent2"><span class="nm">4.</span>Then Avodah, Hoda'ah, and Birchas Kohanim.</p>
<p class="bas indent1"><span class="nm">(b)</span><span class="cl">(R. Akiva):</span> There's no point in mentioning Malchuyos and not blowing Shofar; it should be included in Kedushas ha'Yom and then blow Shofar.</p>
<p class="bas subject"><span class="nm">2)</span>R. AKIVA'S ARGUMENT</p>
<p class="bas indent1"><span class="nm">(a)</span><span class="cl">Question:</span> How could R. Akiva say that there would be no point in mentioning Malchuyos - the Torah instructs it?</p>
<p class="bas indent1"><span class="nm">(b)</span><span class="cl">Answer:</span> He meant that since it is already different to Zichronos and Shofros, it should also have less Pesukim.</p>
<p class="bas subject"><span class="nm">3)</span>THE SOURCES FOR THE <i>BERACHOS</i></p>
<p class="bas indent1"><span class="nm">(a)</span>A Beraisa lists the sources for the obligation to say the Berachos of Avos, Gevuros, and Kedushas Hash-m.</p>
<p class="bas indent1"><span class="nm">(b)</span>R. Eliezer and R. Akiva cite different sources for Zichronos, Shofros, and Kedushas ha'Yom.</p>
<p class="bas indent1"><span class="nm">(c)</span>The source for the Berachah of Malchuyos:</p>
<p class="bas indent2"><span class="nm">1.</span><span class="cl">(Rebbi):</span> The Torah says "I am Hash-m" and continues "In the seventh month."</p>
<p class="bas indent2"><span class="nm">2.</span><span class="cl">(R. Yosi bar Yehudah):</span> A Pasuk shows that Zichronos is always to be accompanied by Malchuyos.</p>
<p class="bas indent1"><span class="nm">(d)</span><span class="cl">Question:</span> Where is Kedushas ha'Yom said?</p>
<p class="bas indent1"><span class="nm">(e)</span><span class="cl">Answer:</span> As taught in a Beraisa:</p>
<p class="bas indent2"><span class="nm">1.</span><span class="cl">(Rebbi):</span> It is said with Malchuyos, as we find that it is always in the fourth Berachah.</p>
<p class="bas indent2"><span class="nm">2.</span><span class="cl">(R. Shimon ben Gamliel):</span> It is said with Zichronos, as we always find that it is in the middle Berachah.</p>
<p class="bas indent1"><span class="nm">(f)</span><span class="cl">(The Beraisa continues):</span> When the Sanhedrin went to Usha, R. Yochanan ben Beruka followed R. Yochanan ben Nuri (in the Mishnah, that Malchuyos is said in Kedushas Hash-m and not accompanied by Shofar).</p>
<p class="bas indent2"><span class="nm">1.</span>R. Shimon ben Gamliel told him that such was not the custom in Yavneh.</p>
<p class="bas indent2"><span class="nm">2.</span>On the second day, R. Chanina ben R. Yosi Hagelili followed R. Akiva (putting Malchuyos in Kedushas ha'Yom with Shofar blowing).</p>
<p class="bas indent2"><span class="nm">3.</span>R. Shimon ben Gamliel told him that such was the custom in Yavneh.</p>
<p class="bas indent3"><span class="nm">i.</span><span class="cl">Question:</span> This shows that R. Shimon ben Gamliel followed R. Akiva, yet R. Akiva said that Kedushas ha'Yom should be said with Malchuyos, and he said that Kedushas ha'Yom should be said with Zichronos!?</p>
<p class="bas indent3"><span class="nm">ii.</span><span class="cl">Answer:</span> R. Shimon ben Gamliel only followed R. Akiva regarding blowing the Shofar for Malchuyos, but not regarding the placement of Kedushas h'Yom.</p>
<p class="bas indent3"><span class="nm">iii.</span><span class="cl">Question:</span> What does "the second day" mean?</p>
<p class="bas indent3"><span class="nm">iv.</span>It can't mean the second day of Yom Tov, as that would mean that Elul was a full month, which never happened after Ezra's time?</p>
<p class="bas indent3"><span class="nm">v.</span><span class="cl">Answer:</span> It means the next day of Rosh Hashanah which occurred, i.e. in the following year.</p>
<p class="bas subject"><span class="nm">4)</span><i>MISHNAH:</i> THE NUMBER OF <i>PESUKIM</i></p>
<p class="bas indent1"><span class="nm">(a)</span>There must be no less than ten Pesukim for Malchuyos, Zichronos and Shofros.</p>
<p class="bas indent1"><span class="nm">(b)</span><span class="cl">(R. Yochanan ben Nuri):</span> If he said three Pesukim for each, he is Yotzei.</p>
<p class="bas subject"><span class="nm">5)</span>THE TEN PESUKIM OF MALCHUYOS</p>
<p class="bas indent1"><span class="nm">(a)</span><span class="cl">Question:</span> What do the ten Pesukim of Malchuyos correspond to?</p>
<p class="bas indent1"><span class="nm">(b)</span><span class="cl">Answer #1 (R. Levi):</span> The expressions of Hallel in Tehillim.</p>
<p class="bas indent2"><span class="nm">1.</span><span class="cl">Question:</span> There are more than ten!?</p>
<p class="bas indent2"><span class="nm">2.</span><span class="cl">Answer:</span> The ten which say to praise Him with Shofar.</p>
<p class="bas indent1"><span class="nm">(c)</span><span class="cl">Answer #2 (R. Yosef):</span> They correspond to the Ten Commandments.</p>
<p class="bas indent1"><span class="nm">(d)</span><span class="cl">Answer #3 (R. Yochanan):</span> They correspond to the ten utterances with which the world was created.</p>
<p class="bas indent2"><span class="nm">1.</span>These are the nine "And he said"'s of Bereishis, plus Bereishis itself.</p>
<p class="bas subject"><span class="nm">6)</span>R. YOCHANAN BEN NURI'S VIEW</p>
<p class="bas indent1"><span class="nm">(a)</span>The Gemara discusses R. Yochanan ben Nuri's opinion that it is adequate to say three Pesukim for each.</p>
<p class="bas indent1"><span class="nm">(b)</span><span class="cl">Question:</span> Does he mean three Pesukim from Torah, from Nevi'im, and Kesuvim, totaling nine, thus differing from the Tana Kama by one, or one from each, totaling three?</p>
<p class="bas indent1"><span class="nm">(c)</span><span class="cl">Answer:</span> We see that he means a total of three:</p>
<p class="bas indent2"><span class="nm">1.</span><span class="cl">(Beraisa):</span> There must be no less than ten Pesukim for Malchuyos, Zichronos and Shofros.</p>
<p class="bas indent2"><span class="nm">2.</span>If he said seven from each, corresponding to the Seven Heavens, he is Yotzei.</p>
<p class="bas indent2"><span class="nm">3.</span><span class="cl">(R. Yochanan ben Nuri):</span> If he says less, he should still say seven; if he says three, he is still Yotzei, corresponding to Torah, Nevi'im and Kesuvim, or Kohanim, Levi'im and Yisraelim.</p>
<p class="bas indent1"><span class="nm">(d)</span>The Halachah follows R. Yochanan ben Nuri.</p>
<p class="bas subject"><span class="nm">7)</span><i>MISHNAH:</i> RESTRICTED <i>PESUKIM</i></p>
<p class="bas indent1"><span class="nm">(a)</span>We do not mention Pesukim of Malchuyos, Zichronos and Shofros that deal with punishment.</p>
<p class="bas indent1"><span class="nm">(b)</span>We begin with a Pasuk from Torah, and finish with one from Nevi'im.</p>
<p class="bas indent1"><span class="nm">(c)</span><span class="cl">(R. Yose):</span> If one finishes with a Pasuk from Torah, he is Yotzei.</p>
<p class="bas bbbline">32b----------------------------------------32b</p>
<p class="bas subject"><span class="nm">8)</span>EXAMPLES AND QUALIFICATIONS</p>
<p class="bas indent1"><span class="nm">(a)</span>The Gemara lists examples of Pesukim dealing with punishment which may not be used (as cited).</p>
<p class="bas indent2"><span class="nm">1.</span>However, one may use Pesukim dealing with punishment to idolaters, such as the examples cited.</p>
<p class="bas indent1"><span class="nm">(b)</span>We do not mention a Pasuk dealing with the remembrance of an individual, even if it is a beneficial one, such as the examples cited.</p>
<p class="bas indent1"><span class="nm">(c)</span><span class="cl">(R. Yosi):</span> Pesukim about Pikdonos are like Zichronos, such as that of Sarah.</p>
<p class="bas indent1"><span class="nm">(d)</span><span class="cl">(R. Yehudah):</span> They are not.</p>
<p class="bas indent2"><span class="nm">1.</span><span class="cl">Question:</span> Even if they are, Sarah was an individual, which we ruled out!?</p>
<p class="bas indent2"><span class="nm">2.</span><span class="cl">Answer:</span> Since she had many descendants, it is considered a remembrance of many.</p>
<p class="bas indent1"><span class="nm">(e)</span>The Beraisa discusses a dispute between R. Yosi and R. Yehudah as to the number of mentions of Malchuyos in Se'u She'arim and Zamru Elokim (as cited).</p>
<p class="bas indent1"><span class="nm">(f)</span>It then mentions another dispute of theirs concerning a Pasuk of Zichronos that also mentions Teru'ah:</p>
<p class="bas indent2"><span class="nm">1.</span><span class="cl">(R. Yosi):</span> It can be said both with Zichronos and Shofros.</p>
<p class="bas indent2"><span class="nm">2.</span><span class="cl">(R. Yehudah):</span> It can only be said with Zichronos.</p>
<p class="bas indent1"><span class="nm">(g)</span>Concerning a Pasuk of Malchuyos that also mentions Teru'ah:</p>
<p class="bas indent2"><span class="nm">1.</span><span class="cl">(R. Yosi):</span> It can be said both with Malchuyos and Shofros.</p>
<p class="bas indent2"><span class="nm">2.</span><span class="cl">(R. Yehudah):</span> It can only be said with Malchuyos.</p>
<p class="bas indent1"><span class="nm">(h)</span>Concerning a Pasuk that only mentions Teru'ah:</p>
<p class="bas indent2"><span class="nm">1.</span><span class="cl">(R. Yosi):</span> It can be said with Shofros.</p>
<p class="bas indent2"><span class="nm">2.</span><span class="cl">(R. Yehudah):</span> It cannot be said at all.</p>
<p class="bas subject"><span class="nm">9)</span>THE FINISHING <i>PASUK</i></p>
<p class="bas indent1"><span class="nm">(a)</span>The Mishnah said that we begin with a Pasuk from Torah, and finish with one from Nevi'im, and R. Yose said that if one finishes with a Pasuk from Torah, he is Yotzei.</p>
<p class="bas indent1"><span class="nm">(b)</span><span class="cl">Question:</span> It seems according to R. Yosi that it is b'Di'eved acceptable if he finishes with a Pasuk from Torah, yet a Beraisa states that he held it to be praiseworthy!?</p>
<p class="bas indent1"><span class="nm">(c)</span><span class="cl">Answer:</span> Emend the Mishnah to read that he <i>should</i> finish with a Pasuk from Torah.</p>
<p class="bas indent1"><span class="nm">(d)</span><span class="cl">Question:</span> But it said "If he did, then he is Yotzei," implying b'Di'eved?</p>
<p class="bas indent1"><span class="nm">(e)</span><span class="cl">Answer:</span> Emend it to read that he <i>should</i> finish with a Pasuk from Torah, but if he <i>did</i> finish with a Pasuk from Nevi'im, he is Yotzei.</p>
<p class="bas indent2"><span class="nm">1.</span>Similarly, we find in a Beraisa that the devoted ones would finish with a Pasuk from Torah.</p>
<p class="bas subject"><span class="nm">10)</span>THE PESUKIM FOR MALCHUYOS</p>
<p class="bas indent1"><span class="nm">(a)</span>The Gemara discusses the rule that the first three and the tenth Pasuk should be from the Torah:</p>
<p class="bas indent1"><span class="nm">(b)</span><span class="cl">Question:</span> That is good for Zichronos and Shofros, but for Malchuyos there are only three Pesukim in the Torah!?</p>
<p class="bas indent1"><span class="nm">(c)</span><span class="cl">Answer:</span> We see in a Beraisa that other Pesukim in the Torah are considered to refer to Malchuyos:</p>
<p class="bas indent2"><span class="nm">1.</span>"Shema Yisrael...", "ve'Yadaata ha'Yom" and "Atah Haraysa" are considered to be Malchuyos according to R. Yosi, but not according to R. Yehudah.</p>
<p class="bas subject"><span class="nm">11)</span>MISHNAH: SHACHARIS AND MUSAF</p>
<p class="bas indent1"><span class="nm">(a)</span>On Rosh Hashanah, the Shofar is blown during Musaf.</p>
<p class="bas indent1"><span class="nm">(b)</span>When Hallel is said (on festivals), it is done by the one leading Shacharis.</p>
<p class="bas subject"><span class="nm">12)</span>UNDERSTANDING THE <i>MISHNAH</i></p>
<p class="bas indent1"><span class="nm">(a)</span><span class="cl">Question:</span> If the Shofar is blown during Musaf, presumably because there are more people and it is more honorable, then Hallel should also be at Musaf; if it is at Shacharis to show zeal, then so too should be Shofar?</p>
<p class="bas indent1"><span class="nm">(b)</span><span class="cl">Answer:</span> The government decreed against Shofar, so it was changed to Musaf to avoid detection.</p>
<p class="bas indent1"><span class="nm">(c)</span><span class="cl">Question:</span> The Mishnah implies that there is no Hallel on Rosh Hashanah - why not?</p>
<p class="bas indent1"><span class="nm">(d)</span><span class="cl">Answer:</span> Hash-m told the Melachim that it would be inappropriate for them to do so while undergoing judgment.</p>
<p class="bas subject"><span class="nm">13)</span><i>MISHNAH:</i> LAWS OF SHOFAR</p>
<p class="bas indent1"><span class="nm">(a)</span>For the Shofar, one may not travel beyond the Techum on Shabbos, clear away rubble, climb a tree, ride an animal, swim, or cut it, whether with something prohibited d'Rabanan or d'Oraisa.</p>
<p class="bas indent2"><span class="nm">1.</span>However, he may rinse it with water or wine.</p>
<p class="bas indent1"><span class="nm">(b)</span>We do not prevent children from blowing the Shofar, but rather we encourage them to learn how to blow it.</p>
<p class="bas indent1"><span class="nm">(c)</span>One who blows absent-mindedly is not Yotzei, nor is someone who hears Shofar from such a person Yotzei.</p>
<p class="bas subject"><span class="nm">14)</span>TRANSGRESSING <i>YOM TOV </i>FOR SHOFAR</p>
<p class="bas indent1"><span class="nm">(a)</span>The reason why one may not break Yom Tov for Shofar is that Shofar is an Ase, whereas Yom Tov is both an Aseh and a Lo Sa'aseh, which is not pushed aside.</p>
<p class="bas indent2"><span class="nm">1.</span><span class="cl">Question:</span> Why did the Mishnah need to prohibit the d'Oraisa of climbing a tree etc. when it has already prohibited the d'Rabanan (of Techum)?</p>
<p class="bas indent2"><span class="nm">2.</span><span class="cl">Answer:</span> The format is that "this, and needless to say this" is forbidden.</p>
<p class="bas normal"></p>
