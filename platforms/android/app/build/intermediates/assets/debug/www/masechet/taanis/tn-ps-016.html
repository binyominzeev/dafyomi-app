<p class="bas subject"><span class="nm">1)</span>THE ORDER OF THE FAST DAY</p>
<p class="bas indent1"><span class="nm">(a)</span><span class="cl">Question:</span> Why did everyone go out into the street?</p>
<p class="bas indent1"><span class="nm">(b)</span><span class="cl">Answer #1 (R. Chiya bar Aba):</span> To proclaim that we have cried out in the privacy of Shul and have not been answered, so now we are demeaning ourselves in public.</p>
<p class="bas indent1"><span class="nm">(c)</span><span class="cl">Answer #2 (Resh Lakish):</span> To proclaim that we are undergoing exile as an atonement.</p>
<p class="bas indent2"><span class="nm">1.</span>The practical difference would be in a case where they moved from one Shul to another, which would only be effective according to the second explanation.</p>
<p class="bas indent1"><span class="nm">(d)</span><span class="cl">Question:</span> Why was the Aron taken out into the street?</p>
<p class="bas indent1"><span class="nm">(e)</span><span class="cl">Answer:</span> To show that our private vessel has become demeaned through our sins.</p>
<p class="bas indent1"><span class="nm">(f)</span><span class="cl">Question:</span> Why do the people wear sackcloth?</p>
<p class="bas indent1"><span class="nm">(g)</span><span class="cl">Answer:</span> To proclaim that we are no better than animals (and therefore wear animal skins).</p>
<p class="bas indent1"><span class="nm">(h)</span><span class="cl">Question:</span> Why are ashes placed on the Aron?</p>
<p class="bas indent1"><span class="nm">(i)</span><span class="cl">Answer:</span> As Hash-m is with His people in their distress.</p>
<p class="bas indent2"><span class="nm">1.</span><span class="cl">(R. Zeira):</span> "When I first saw them place ashes on the Aron, my whole body trembled."</p>
<p class="bas indent1"><span class="nm">(j)</span><span class="cl">Question:</span> Why would everybody place ashes on their head?</p>
<p class="bas indent1"><span class="nm">(k)</span><span class="cl">Answer #1:</span> To proclaim that we are considered before Hash-m as ashes.</p>
<p class="bas indent1"><span class="nm">(l)</span><span class="cl">Answer #2:</span> To raise the memory of the ashes of Yitzchak.</p>
<p class="bas indent2"><span class="nm">1.</span>The practical difference is that according to the first answer, dust would suffice.</p>
<p class="bas indent1"><span class="nm">(m)</span><span class="cl">Question:</span> Why would everyone go to the cemetery?</p>
<p class="bas indent1"><span class="nm">(n)</span><span class="cl">Answer #1:</span> To proclaim that we are considered before Hash-m as the dead.</p>
<p class="bas indent1"><span class="nm">(o)</span><span class="cl">Answer #2:</span> So that the dead should pray for mercy on our behalf.</p>
<p class="bas indent2"><span class="nm">1.</span>The practical difference is that according to the first answer, a non-Jewish cemetery would suffice.</p>
<p class="bas indent1"><span class="nm">(p)</span><span class="cl">Question:</span> Why was Har ha'Moriah so called?</p>
<p class="bas indent1"><span class="nm">(q)</span><span class="cl">Answer #1:</span> It is the mountain from which teachings (Hora'ah) went out for Israel.</p>
<p class="bas indent1"><span class="nm">(r)</span><span class="cl">Answer #2:</span> It is the mountain which caused fear (Mora) for the non-Jews.</p>
<p class="bas subject"><span class="nm">2)</span>THE SPEECH</p>
<p class="bas indent1"><span class="nm">(a)</span>The Mishnah said that the oldest present would deliver a moving speech.</p>
<p class="bas indent1"><span class="nm">(b)</span><span class="cl">(Beraisa):</span> If there is an elder present, he delivers it; otherwise, a Chacham delivers it; otherwise, a person of stature should deliver it.</p>
<p class="bas indent2"><span class="nm">1.</span><span class="cl">Question:</span> Does this mean that the first choice is an elder even if he is not a Chacham?</p>
<p class="bas indent2"><span class="nm">2.</span><span class="cl">Answer:</span> It means that the first choice is an elder who is also a Chacham.</p>
<p class="bas indent1"><span class="nm">(c)</span>He should say that, as we find with the people of Ninveh, it is not sackcloth and fasting which help, but repentance and good deeds.</p>
<p class="bas indent1"><span class="nm">(d)</span>The people of Ninveh tied up the animals away from their young, and told Hash-m that if He did not have mercy on them, they wouldn't have mercy on their animals.</p>
<p class="bas indent1"><span class="nm">(e)</span>They challenged Hash-m that the righteous should sway the fate of the wicked, rather than vice-versa.</p>
<p class="bas indent2"><span class="nm">1.</span>What does the Pasuk mean with "they repented from the violence of their hands"?</p>
<p class="bas indent2"><span class="nm">2.</span><span class="cl">Answer:</span> A person who stole a beam and built a building with it destroyed the building to return it to its owner.</p>
<p class="bas indent2"><span class="nm">3.</span>A person who has stolen something and repents without returning it is like someone holding a Sheretz for whom all the waters in the world will not work for Tevilah.</p>
<p class="bas indent3"><span class="nm">i.</span>But as soon as he discards it, forty Se'ah alone works as a Tevilah.</p>
<p class="bas indent2"><span class="nm">4.</span>The Pasuk says that we have to place our heart in our hands i.e. to repent in deed.</p>
<p class="bas subject"><span class="nm">3)</span>THE SHALI'ACH TZIBUR</p>
<p class="bas indent1"><span class="nm">(a)</span>The Mishnah says that an elder etc. would act as the Shali'ach Tzibur.</p>
<p class="bas indent1"><span class="nm">(b)</span><span class="cl">(Beraisa):</span> Even if there is an elder who is a Chacham present, the Shali'ach Tzibur must be someone who is practiced.</p>
<p class="bas indent1"><span class="nm">(c)</span>It must be someone with dependants whom he cannot support; agricultural concerns; an empty home; a noble history; humble; beloved to the people; pleasant voiced; familiar with Tenach, Midrash, Halachah and Agadah; and familiar with all the Berachos.</p>
<p class="bas indent1"><span class="nm">(d)</span>R. Yiztchak bar Ami was considered to meet these criteria.</p>
<p class="bas bbbline">16b----------------------------------------16b</p>
<p class="bas indent1"><span class="nm">(e)</span><span class="cl">Question:</span> Is not having dependants whom he cannot support the same as  having an empty house?</p>
<p class="bas indent1"><span class="nm">(f)</span><span class="cl">Answer:</span> It refers to having a house empty of sin.</p>
<p class="bas indent1"><span class="nm">(g)</span>"A noble history" means that he did not get a bad name in his youth.</p>
<p class="bas indent1"><span class="nm">(h)</span>The Pasuk about a lion "roaring against me" refers to an unsuitable Shali'ach Tzibur.</p>
<p class="bas subject"><span class="nm">4)</span>THE EXTRA <i>BERACHOS</i></p>
<p class="bas indent1"><span class="nm">(a)</span><span class="cl">Question:</span> The Mishnah says that six Berachos were added; yet it lists seven concluding Berachos!?</p>
<p class="bas indent1"><span class="nm">(b)</span><span class="cl">Answer:</span> The seventh does not conclude a seventh new Berachah, but rather the seventh Berachah from the one which was added on to:</p>
<p class="bas indent2"><span class="nm">1.</span>This is the Berachah of Go'el Yisrael, which is lengthened and responded to with Amen; the Chazan then calls for a Tekiyah.</p>
<p class="bas indent2"><span class="nm">2.</span>After the next Berachah, he calls for a Teruah, and alternates in this way for all of them.</p>
<p class="bas indent1"><span class="nm">(c)</span>This was only true in the rest of Eretz Yisrael, but not in the Beis ha'Mikdash, where they do not say Amen.</p>
<p class="bas indent1"><span class="nm">(d)</span>We know this as the Pasuk, referring to the Beis ha'Mikdash, says that when Hash-m is blessed, the people would respond with Baruch Shem Kevod Malchuso l'Olam Va'ed.</p>
<p class="bas indent1"><span class="nm">(e)</span>One might think that this response is only said once; the Pasuk therefore says that it is said in response to every Berachah.</p>
<p class="bas indent1"><span class="nm">(f)</span>The Chazan then calls for a Tekiyah, and after the next Berachah, he calls for a Teruah, and alternates in this way for all of them.</p>
<p class="bas indent2"><span class="nm">1.</span>R. Chalafta acted in this way in Tzipori, as did R. Chananyah b. Tradyon in Sichni.</p>
<p class="bas indent2"><span class="nm">2.</span>The Chachamim responded that the custom was to do so only in Sha'ar ha'Mizrach and Har ha'Bayis.</p>
<p class="bas indent1"><span class="nm">(g)</span>The Gemara then lists an alternative rendition of the Beraisa (as cited).</p>
<p class="bas indent1"><span class="nm">(h)</span>R. Yehudah said that Zichronos and Shofaros need not be amongst the six extra Berachos.</p>
<p class="bas indent2"><span class="nm">1.</span>His reason is that these are only said on Rosh Hashanah, Yovel, and during times of war.</p>
