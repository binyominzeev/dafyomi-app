<p class="bas subject"><span class="nm">1)</span>ACQUISITION THROUGH CHANGE</p>
<p class="bas indent1"><span class="nm">(a)</span>Beis Hillel say, "they (are disqualified)", but what they are transformed into is not.</p>
<p class="bas indent2"><span class="nm">1.</span>Beis Shamai expound "they (are disqualified)", but their offspring are not.</p>
<p class="bas indent2"><span class="nm">2.</span>Beis Hillel say that "they" excludes both of these (they are valid for Korbanos).</p>
<p class="bas indent1"><span class="nm">(b)</span><span class="cl">Question:</span> What do Beis Hillel learn from "also"?</p>
<p class="bas indent1"><span class="nm">(c)</span>This is left unanswered.</p>
<p class="bas indent1"><span class="nm">(d)</span>Beis Shamai and Beis Hillel argue only about whether or not one acquires through a change, but all agree, Kefel, four and five are like the time of the theft!</p>
<p class="bas indent1"><span class="nm">(e)</span><span class="cl">Question:</span> Rav said that principal is like the time of the theft, and Kefel, four and five are like the time of the trial!</p>
<p class="bas indent1"><span class="nm">(f)</span><span class="cl">Answer (Rava):</span> The Beraisa teaches that he pays lambs, like the time of the theft, but he pays according to the market value at the time of the trial.</p>
<p class="bas indent1"><span class="nm">(g)</span><span class="cl">(Rabah):</span> A verse and Mishnayos teach that one acquires through a change.</p>
<p class="bas indent2"><span class="nm">1.</span>"He will return the stolen object that he stole" - these words are redundant, to teach that he returns it if only it is like he stole. If not, he just owes their value.</p>
<p class="bas indent2"><span class="nm">2.</span><span class="cl">(Mishnah):</span> If a thief stole wood or wool and made it into Kelim, he pays their value at the time he stole them.</p>
<p class="bas indent2"><span class="nm">3.</span><span class="cl">(Mishnah):</span> If a Yisrael dyed his first shearings before giving them to a Kohen, he is exempt (from giving them to a Kohen).</p>
<p class="bas indent3"><span class="nm">i.</span>These show that one acquires through a change.</p>
<p class="bas subject"><span class="nm">2)</span>ACQUISITION THROUGH DESPAIR</p>
<p class="bas indent1"><span class="nm">(a)</span><span class="cl">(Rabah):</span> If the owner despairs, the thief acquires. We do not know if this is mid'Oraisa or mid'Rabanan.</p>
<p class="bas indent2"><span class="nm">1.</span>Perhaps it is like an Aveidah. If the owner despaired before it was found, the finder acquires it mid'Oraisa. The same applies to a thief;</p>
<p class="bas indent2"><span class="nm">2.</span>Or, perhaps an Aveidah is different, for the finder had permission to pick it up;</p>
<p class="bas indent3"><span class="nm">i.</span>A thief only acquires mid'Rabanan. This is an enactment to help people repent.</p>
<p class="bas indent1"><span class="nm">(b)</span><span class="cl">(Rav Yosef):</span> A thief does not acquire through despair (of the owner), even mid'Rabanan.</p>
<p class="bas indent1"><span class="nm">(c)</span><span class="cl">Question (Rav Yosef - Mishnah):</span> If a thief stole Chametz, and it became forbidden on Pesach, he can return it after Pesach and say 'here is your Chametz'!</p>
<p class="bas bbbline">66b----------------------------------------66b</p>
<p class="bas indent2"><span class="nm">1.</span>Surely, when Pesach came, the owner despaired. If the thief acquired it, he would not be able to return it. He would need to return the value of what he stole!</p>
<p class="bas indent1"><span class="nm">(d)</span><span class="cl">Answer (Rabah):</span> I said only that a thief acquires through despair when he wants to acquire. Here, he does not want to acquire.</p>
<p class="bas indent1"><span class="nm">(e)</span><span class="cl">Question (Abaye - Beraisa):</span> "His Korban" - not a stolen one.</p>
<p class="bas indent2"><span class="nm">1.</span><span class="cl">Question:</span> What is the case?</p>
<p class="bas indent3"><span class="nm">i.</span><span class="cl">Suggestion:</span> If the owner did not despair yet, this is obvious!</p>
<p class="bas indent2"><span class="nm">2.</span><span class="cl">Answer:</span> Rather, the owner despaired. This shows that the thief did not acquire it!</p>
<p class="bas indent2"><span class="nm">3.</span><span class="cl">Counter-question (Rabah - Beraisa):</span> "His (a Zav's) mattress (becomes an Av ha'Tum'ah to be Metamei people when he sits on it)", but a stolen one does not.</p>
<p class="bas indent3"><span class="nm">i.</span>If Reuven stole wool and made a mattress, all agree that he acquires through change!</p>
<p class="bas indent2"><span class="nm">4.</span><span class="cl">Answer:</span> Rather, you must say that he stole another's mattress.</p>
<p class="bas indent1"><span class="nm">(f)</span><span class="cl">Answer:</span> Likewise, we can say that he stole another's Korban!</p>
<p class="bas subject"><span class="nm">3)</span>WHEN INTENT HELPS FOR <i>TUM'AH</i></p>
<p class="bas indent1"><span class="nm">(a)</span><span class="cl">Question (Abaye - Mishnah):</span> Hides of a regular person can receive Tum'ah through intent;</p>
<p class="bas indent2"><span class="nm">1.</span>A tanner's hides cannot receive Tum'ah through intent.</p>
<p class="bas indent2"><span class="nm">2.</span>Hides of a Ganav (covert thief) can receive Tum'ah through intent. Hides of a Gazlan (open robber) cannot.</p>
<p class="bas indent2"><span class="nm">3.</span>R. Shimon says, hides of a Ganav cannot receive Tum'ah through intent. Hides of a Gazlan can, because the owner despaired.</p>
<p class="bas indent2"><span class="nm">4.</span>This shows that one acquires through despair of the owner!</p>
<p class="bas indent1"><span class="nm">(b)</span><span class="cl">Answer #1 (Rav Yosef):</span> The case is, he cut them (the change helps him acquire them).</p>
<p class="bas indent1"><span class="nm">(c)</span><span class="cl">Question (Rav Chanan):</span> The Mishnah discusses a table- cover, which does not need to be cut!</p>
<p class="bas indent2"><span class="nm">1.</span><span class="cl">(Mishnah):</span> Anything that needs no further work can receive Tum'ah through intent;</p>
<p class="bas indent2"><span class="nm">2.</span>Anything that needs further work cannot receive Tum'ah through intent, except for a table-cover.</p>
<p class="bas indent1"><span class="nm">(d)</span><span class="cl">Answer #2 (Rava):</span> A change in the name of the object is like a physical change.</p>
<p class="bas indent2"><span class="nm">1.</span>One acquires through physical change, e.g. he stole wood, and now it is Kelim. Similarly, it was called a hide, and now it is called a table-cover.</p>
<p class="bas indent1"><span class="nm">(e)</span><span class="cl">Question:</span> Regarding a beam, a change in name (to 'roof') does not acquire!</p>
<p class="bas indent2"><span class="nm">1.</span><span class="cl">(Mishnah):</span> One who built a stolen beam into his house can return its value to the owner. This is an enactment to help thieves repent.</p>
<p class="bas indent2"><span class="nm">2.</span>If not for the enactment, he would not acquire it!</p>
