<p class="bas subject"><span class="nm">1)</span><i>TELIYAH</i> OF ONE KESEM ON ANOTHER</p>
<p class="bas indent1"><span class="nm">(a)</span><span class="cl">Version #1 - Tosfos - Question (against Rav Huna - Beraisa):</span> If there were drops of blood above and below (the belt), we can be Toleh lower blood on upper blood up to a Gris. (Surely, the upper blood is not from her. Wherever it came from, we say that the lower blood is also from there.)</p>
<p class="bas indent2"><span class="nm">1.</span><span class="cl">Suggestion:</span> If a lower Kesem is up to a Gris, we can be Toleh on an upper one. (If it is less than a Gris, in any case we are Toleh on a louse. The Chidush must be about exactly a Gris. We are not Toleh on a louse, but we are Toleh on the upper Kesem!)</p>
<p class="bas indent1"><span class="nm">(b)</span><span class="cl">Rejection:</span> No, it means that if the upper Kesem is (too big to be Toleh on a louse, e.g. three Grisim or two or any amount) up to (but not including) a Gris, we can be Toleh the lower one on it.</p>
<p class="bas indent1"><span class="nm">(c)</span><span class="cl">Version #2 - Rashi - Question (against Rav Huna - Beraisa):</span> If there were drops of blood more than and less than a Gris, we can be Toleh up to a Gris.</p>
<p class="bas indent2"><span class="nm">1.</span><span class="cl">Suggestion:</span> This means, we can be Toleh up to and including a Gris!</p>
<p class="bas indent1"><span class="nm">(d)</span><span class="cl">Rejection:</span> No, we can be Toleh up to but not including a Gris. (end of Version #2)</p>
<p class="bas indent1"><span class="nm">(e)</span><span class="cl">(R. Chanina):</span> If more than a Gris was found on her, and a louse is mashed into the Kesem, she is Teme'ah;</p>
<p class="bas indent2"><span class="nm">1.</span>We are not Toleh more than a Gris on lice (even if we see a louse in the Kesem).</p>
<p class="bas indent1"><span class="nm">(f)</span><span class="cl">(R. Yanai):</span> She is Tehorah;</p>
<p class="bas indent2"><span class="nm">1.</span>We are not Toleh more than a Gris on lice when there is no known louse in the Kesem. Here, we are Toleh the excess over a Gris (Tosfos ha'Rosh - up to a Gris) on the known louse. We may be Toleh the remaining Gris on an unknown louse, as usual. (In the Mishnah, we are not Toleh more than a Gris even when she killed a louse, for we do not know whether or not its blood is in the Kesem found. - <b>PF</b>.)</p>
<p class="bas indent1"><span class="nm">(g)</span><span class="cl">Question (R. Yirmeyah):</span> If a woman engaged in blood (that could make a Kesem) the size of a Gris, and she found a Kesem more than a Gris, what is the law?</p>
<p class="bas indent2"><span class="nm">1.</span>He asks according to R. Chanina and R. Yanai.</p>
<p class="bas indent2"><span class="nm">2.</span>R. Chanina is Metamei only when she did not engage in blood (he is never Toleh more than a Gris on lice). However, when she engaged in blood, he could be Toleh up to a Gris on the blood, and the remaining Gris on an unknown louse!</p>
<p class="bas indent2"><span class="nm">3.</span>R. Yanai is Metaher only when she found a known louse in the Kesem. When she did not, perhaps he is not Toleh more than a Gris (on things that are not known)!</p>
<p class="bas indent1"><span class="nm">(h)</span><span class="cl">Answer (Beraisa):</span> If a woman engaged in red things, she may not be Toleh a black Kesem on them. (This is not so obvious. Black blood was originally red. One might have thought that we are Toleh that the blood changed color);</p>
<p class="bas indent2"><span class="nm">1.</span>If she dealt with a small amount, she may not be Toleh a large Kesem on it.</p>
<p class="bas indent2"><span class="nm">2.</span><span class="cl">Question:</span> What is the case?</p>
<p class="bas indent2"><span class="nm">3.</span><span class="cl">Answer #1:</span> The case is like our question. (She engaged in the size of a Gris, and found a Kesem more than a Gris, and it says that she may not be Toleh!)</p>
<p class="bas indent1"><span class="nm">(i)</span><span class="cl">Rejection (and Answer #2 to Question h:2):</span> No, she engaged in a Gris, and found a Kesem more than two Grisim.</p>
<p class="bas indent1"><span class="nm">(j)</span><span class="cl">Objection:</span> If so, obviously we cannot be Toleh!</p>
<p class="bas indent1"><span class="nm">(k)</span><span class="cl">Answer:</span> One might have thought that we are Toleh that the blood she dealt with is in the middle, so less than a Gris remains on each side, and we are Toleh each remainder on a louse. The Beraisa teaches that this is not so. (Rosh - this is a flimsy rejection. There is no reason to be Toleh that the blood she dealt with is in the middle. The Halachah follows Answer #1.)</p>
<p class="bas indent1"><span class="nm">(l)</span><span class="cl">Version #1 (Rava):</span> If one substance resembling blood (but it is not blood) was found on her, she may be Toleh different appearances (which could be blood) on it. (Just like the first substance came from elsewhere and she did not notice, the same applies to the others.)</p>
<p class="bas indent1"><span class="nm">(m)</span><span class="cl">Question (Beraisa):</span> If a woman engaged in red things, she may not be Toleh a black Kesem on them.</p>
<p class="bas indent1"><span class="nm">(n)</span><span class="cl">Answer:</span> The law is different when she engaged in red things. (We have no source to say that anything else came on her without her noticing.)</p>
<p class="bas indent1"><span class="nm">(o)</span><span class="cl">Version #2 (Rava):</span> If a woman engaged in one thing, she may be Toleh other things on it.</p>
<p class="bas indent1"><span class="nm">(p)</span><span class="cl">Question (Beraisa):</span> If a woman engaged in red things, she may not be Toleh a black Kesem on them.</p>
<p class="bas indent1"><span class="nm">(q)</span><span class="cl">Answer:</span> Rava discusses a chicken. It has various appearances of blood.</p>
<p class="bas subject"><span class="nm">2)</span>STRINGENCIES OF <i>KESAMIM</i></p>
<p class="bas indent1"><span class="nm">(a)</span><span class="cl">(Mishnah):</span> A case occurred... (R. Akiva says, Chachamim enacted Kesamim, but to be lenient... )</p>
<p class="bas indent1"><span class="nm">(b)</span><span class="cl">Contradiction (Beraisa):</span> Chachamim enacted Kesamim, to be stringent.</p>
<p class="bas indent1"><span class="nm">(c)</span><span class="cl">Resolution (Ravina):</span> The Beraisa means, Chachamim enacted Kesamim to be more stringent than the Torah. The entire law of Kesamim is mid'Rabanan.</p>
<p class="bas indent1"><span class="nm">(d)</span><span class="cl">(Mishnah - R. Eliezer bar Tzadok):</span> If an Ed was under a pillow... (if blood is in a round shape, she is Tehorah. If it is a streak, she is Teme'ah).</p>
<p class="bas indent1"><span class="nm">(e)</span><span class="cl">Question:</span> Do Chachamim argue with R. Eliezer?</p>
<p class="bas indent1"><span class="nm">(f)</span><span class="cl">Answer #1 (Beraisa):</span> (The extent of) a long Kesem joins (for the Shi'ur of over a Gris), but spots of blood do not join.</p>
<p class="bas indent2"><span class="nm">1.</span><span class="cl">Question:</span> Who is the Tana of the Beraisa?</p>
<p class="bas indent3"><span class="nm">i.</span>It cannot be R. Eliezer. He does not require a Shi'ur for a streak!</p>
<p class="bas indent2"><span class="nm">2.</span><span class="cl">Answer #1:</span> (We must say that Chachamim argue with R. Eliezer.) The Tana is Chachamim.</p>
<p class="bas indent1"><span class="nm">(g)</span><span class="cl">Rejection (and Answer #2 to Question f:1):</span> No, the Tana is R. Eliezer. He does not require a Shi'ur for a streak on an Ed, but he requires a Shi'ur for Kesamim. (Blood on an Ed creates a Safek mid'Oraisa. Perhaps it came with Hargashah, but she attributed the Hargashah to the Bedikah! Also, it is reasonable to be stringent about an Ed because the blood almost certainly came from the Makor, for lice rarely enter that area.)</p>
<p class="bas indent1"><span class="nm">(h)</span><span class="cl">Answer #2:</span> Rav Yehudah taught that the Halachah follows R. Eliezer.</p>
<p class="bas indent2"><span class="nm">1.</span>This implies that there is an argument.</p>

<p class="bas subject"><span class="nm">3)</span>BLOOD FOUND IN URINE</p>
<p class="bas indent1"><span class="nm">(a)</span><span class="cl">(Mishnah - R. Meir):</span> If a woman urinated and saw blood:</p>
<p class="bas indent2"><span class="nm">1.</span>If she was standing, she is Teme'ah; if she was sitting, she is Tehorah.</p>
<p class="bas indent1"><span class="nm">(b)</span>R. Yosi says, in either case she is Tehorah.</p>
<p class="bas indent1"><span class="nm">(c)</span>R. Yosi says, if a man and woman urinated into the same Kli and there is blood in the urine, she is Tehorah;</p>
<p class="bas indent1"><span class="nm">(d)</span>R. Shimon is Metamei, because it is rare for blood to come from a man. The Chazakah is that it came from her.</p>
<p class="bas indent1"><span class="nm">(e)</span><span class="cl">(Gemara) Question:</span> What difference does it make if she was standing or sitting?</p>
<p class="bas indent2"><span class="nm">1.</span>Surely, the stringency of standing is that the urine goes to the Makor (before coming out), the Dam came from there. Also when she sits, (if she does not allow the urine to spurt) it goes to the Makor!</p>
<p class="bas indent1"><span class="nm">(f)</span><span class="cl">Answer (Shmuel):</span> The case is, she allowed the urine to spurt.</p>
<p class="bas indent1"><span class="nm">(g)</span><span class="cl">Question:</span> We should be concerned lest after the urine spurted, (Tosfos - it dripped, some went to the Makor and) blood came from the Makor!</p>
<p class="bas indent1"><span class="nm">(h)</span><span class="cl">Answer (R. Aba):</span> The case is, she sat on the edge of the Kli. Had the blood came after the spurting stopped, it would have been found on the Kli.</p>
<p class="bas indent1"><span class="nm">(i)</span><span class="cl">(Shmuel and R. Aba):</span> The Halachah follows R. Yosi.</p>
<p class="bas indent1"><span class="nm">(j)</span><span class="cl">(Mishnah - R. Yosi):</span> If a man or woman urinated...</p>
<p class="bas indent1"><span class="nm">(k)</span><span class="cl">Question:</span> What would R. Meir say if a man and woman stood and urinated into the same Kli?</p>
<p class="bas indent2"><span class="nm">1.</span>Perhaps R. Meir is Metamei only regarding a single Safek (whether or not it came from the Makor), but not when there is another Safek (perhaps the blood is from him);</p>
<p class="bas indent2"><span class="nm">2.</span>Or, perhaps he is Metamei in either case!</p>
<p class="bas indent1"><span class="nm">(l)</span><span class="cl">Answer #1 (Reish Lakish):</span> He is Metamei in either case.</p>
<p class="bas indent2"><span class="nm">1.</span><span class="cl">Question:</span> What is Reish Lakish's source for this?</p>
<p class="bas indent2"><span class="nm">2.</span><span class="cl">Answer:</span> Since the Mishnah does not say that R. Meir and R. Yosi are Metaher, this implies that R. Meir is Metamei.</p>
<p class="bas indent2"><span class="nm">3.</span><span class="cl">Question:</span> If R. Meir is Metamei even in a Sfek Sfeika, the Tana should have taught this, and he would not need to teach (the Reisha,) that he is Metamei a single Safek!</p>
<p class="bas indent2"><span class="nm">4.</span><span class="cl">Answer:</span> The argument was taught in the Reisha to teach the Ko'ach (extremity) of R. Yosi. He is Metaher a single Safek.</p>
<p class="bas indent2"><span class="nm">5.</span><span class="cl">Question:</span> Why does he teach the Ko'ach of R. Yosi, and not the (argument in the Seifa, i.e. the) Ko'ach of R. Meir?</p>
<p class="bas indent2"><span class="nm">6.</span><span class="cl">Answer:</span> It is preferable to teach the Ko'ach of the lenient opinion.</p>
<p class="bas indent1"><span class="nm">(m)</span><span class="cl">Answer #2 (R. Yochanan):</span> R. Meir is Metamei a single Safek, but he agrees that a Sfek Sfeika is Tahor.</p>
<p class="bas indent1"><span class="nm">(n)</span><span class="cl">Question:</span> If so, both R. Meir and R. Yosi should be Metaher in the Seifa!</p>
<p class="bas indent1"><span class="nm">(o)</span><span class="cl">Answer:</span> Indeed, they do. Since the Reisha ended with R. Yosi's opinion, the law of the Seifa was said in his name (even though R. Meir agrees with it).</p>
<p class="bas indent1"><span class="nm">(p)</span><span class="cl">Question:</span> Since R. Yosi is Metaher a single Safek, there was no need to teach that he is Metaher a Sfek Sfeika!</p>
<p class="bas indent1"><span class="nm">(q)</span><span class="cl">Answer:</span> One might have thought that he is Metaher a single Safek b'Di'eved (if she already touched Taharos), but l'Chatchilah she should not touch. The extra clause teaches that he is Metaher even l'Chatchilah.</p>
<p class="bas indent1"><span class="nm">(r)</span><span class="cl">Support (for R. Yochanan - Beraisa - R. Meir and R. Yosi):</span> If a man and woman urinated into the same Kli and there is blood in the urine, she is Tehorah;</p>

<p class="bas subject"><span class="nm">4)</span>R. SHIMON'S OPINION</p>
<p class="bas indent1"><span class="nm">(a)</span><span class="cl">Question:</span> What would R. Shimon say if a woman sat and urinated (by herself)?</p>
<p class="bas indent2"><span class="nm">1.</span>Perhaps he is Metamei only if she was standing, for there is no room (for the urine to flow straight out. It goes to the Makor first.) However, if she was sitting, she is Tehorah;</p>
<p class="bas indent2"><span class="nm">2.</span>Or, perhaps he does not distinguish!</p>
<p class="bas indent1"><span class="nm">(b)</span><span class="cl">Answer (Beraisa - R. Meir):</span> If a woman sat and urinated (and saw blood), she may be Toleh (that it came from the source of urine), but not if she was standing;</p>
<p class="bas indent1"><span class="nm">(c)</span>R. Yosi says, in either case she may be Toleh;</p>
<p class="bas indent1"><span class="nm">(d)</span>R. Shimon says, in either case she may not be Toleh.</p>
<p class="bas indent1"><span class="nm">(e)</span><span class="cl">Question:</span> What would R. Shimon say if a woman sat and urinated into the same Kli as a man?</p>
<p class="bas indent2"><span class="nm">1.</span>Perhaps (in the Mishnah) he is Metamei only if she was standing (even if a man also urinated into the Kli, for then her urine surely went to the Makor first) or if she was sitting (and all the urine is from her), for each is like a single Safek. However, if she sat and urinated into the same Kli as a man, this is a Sfek Sefeika, so he is Metaher!</p>
<p class="bas indent2"><span class="nm">2.</span>Or, perhaps he does not distinguish!</p>
<p class="bas indent1"><span class="nm">(f)</span><span class="cl">Answer (Mishnah - R. Shimon):</span> She is Teme'ah, for the Chazakah is that it came from her.</p>
<p class="bas indent2"><span class="nm">1.</span>He does not distinguish between standing and sitting.</p>
<p class="bas subject"><span class="nm">5)</span>BLOOD THAT MAY HAVE COME FROM DIFFERENT WOMEN</p>
<p class="bas indent1"><span class="nm">(a)</span><span class="cl">(Mishnah):</span> If a (Tahor) woman lent a (checked) garment to a Nidah or a Nochris, received it back, wore it, and found a Kesem (Rashi; Rashba - the Tehorah wore it before lending it), she is Toleh that the Kesem came from the borrower.</p>
<p class="bas indent1"><span class="nm">(b)</span>If three women wore the same garment or sat on the same bench, and blood was found, all are Teme'os;</p>
<p class="bas indent1"><span class="nm">(c)</span>R. Nechemyah says, if they sat on a stone bench or the platform of the bathhouse, they are Tehoros;</p>
