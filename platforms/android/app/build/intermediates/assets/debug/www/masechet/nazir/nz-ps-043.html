<p class="bas subject"><span class="nm">1)</span>DOUBLE LIABILITY FOR <i>TUM'AH</i></p>
<p class="bas indent1"><span class="nm">(a)</span><span class="cl">Question:</span> Even in the house, the moment his hand enters, he becomes Tamei. When his whole body (really, the majority) enters, he is already Tamei!</p>
<p class="bas indent1"><span class="nm">(b)</span><span class="cl">Answer #2 (R. Eliezer):</span> If he sticks his hand in first, he is liable only for Tum'ah. If he keeps his hand by his body, he becomes Tamei when he enters, and he is also liable for entering.</p>
<p class="bas indent1"><span class="nm">(c)</span><span class="cl">Objection:</span> His nose will enter first, and he will be Tamei before his body enters!</p>
<p class="bas indent1"><span class="nm">(d)</span><span class="cl">Answer #3 (Rava):</span> If he sticks his hand in first, he is liable only for Tum'ah. If he enters his body first, he becomes Tamei like he enters.</p>
<p class="bas indent1"><span class="nm">(e)</span><span class="cl">Objection:</span> Surely his toes will enter before (most of) his body!</p>
<p class="bas indent1"><span class="nm">(f)</span><span class="cl">Answer #4 (Rav Papa):</span> The case is, he entered the Ohel in an enclosed box, and someone else removed the bottom of the box. Tum'ah and entering come at the same moment.</p>
<p class="bas indent1"><span class="nm">(g)</span><span class="cl">Answer #5 (Mar bar Rav Ashi):</span> The case is, he entered an Ohel containing a Goses (a dying person), and the Goses died when he was there. Tum'ah and entering come together.</p>
<p class="bas subject"><span class="nm">2)</span>ENTERING AN <i>OHEL</i> IN WHICH THERE IS A <i>GOSES</i></p>
<p class="bas indent1"><span class="nm">(a)</span><span class="cl">(Beraisa):</span> "(A Kohen is forbidden Leheichalo (to profane himself)" - he is not profaned until the time of death (when there is a Chalal, corpse);</p>
<p class="bas indent1"><span class="nm">(b)</span>Rebbi says, "he (a Nazir) may not be Metamei for them (his relatives) in their deaths" - the Isur is not until they die.</p>
<p class="bas indent1"><span class="nm">(c)</span><span class="cl">Question:</span> What is the difference between the opinions?</p>
<p class="bas indent1"><span class="nm">(d)</span><span class="cl">Answer #1 (R. Yochanan):</span> They argue only about how the Halachah is derived.</p>
<p class="bas indent1"><span class="nm">(e)</span><span class="cl">Answer #2 (Reish Lakish):</span> They argue about a Goses:</p>
<p class="bas indent2"><span class="nm">1.</span>The first Tana learns from "Leheichalo". This includes a Goses, who will become a Chalal (Mes);</p>
<p class="bas indent2"><span class="nm">2.</span>Rebbi learns from "in their death". It is forbidden until after death.</p>
<p class="bas indent1"><span class="nm">(f)</span><span class="cl">Question:</span> What does the first Tana learn from "in their death"?</p>
<p class="bas indent1"><span class="nm">(g)</span><span class="cl">Answer:</span> He expounds like Rebbi:</p>
<p class="bas indent2"><span class="nm">1.</span><span class="cl">(Rebbi):</span> "In their death" he may not become Tamei (Mes) through them, but he may become Tamei through their plagues or emissions.</p>
<p class="bas indent1"><span class="nm">(h)</span><span class="cl">Question:</span> How can Rebbi expound this? He already expounded this verse regarding a Goses!</p>
<p class="bas indent1"><span class="nm">(i)</span><span class="cl">Answer:</span> Had the Torah wanted to teach only that law, it would have said 'in his death' (of any relative). It says "in their deaths" to teach us both.</p>
<p class="bas indent1"><span class="nm">(j)</span><span class="cl">Question:</span> What does Rebbi learn from "Leheichalo"?</p>
<p class="bas indent1"><span class="nm">(k)</span><span class="cl">Answer:</span> This excludes one who is already profaned.</p>
<p class="bas indent1"><span class="nm">(l)</span><span class="cl">Question:</span> Also Chachamim must learn this from "Leheichalo"! How can they use it to teach about a Goses?</p>
<p class="bas indent1"><span class="nm">(m)</span><span class="cl">Answer:</span> Had the Torah wanted to teach only this, it would have said 'Leheichal'. It says "Leheichalo", so we learn two laws.</p>
<p class="bas indent1"><span class="nm">(n)</span><span class="cl">Question (Beraisa):</span> A man is not Metamei until his soul leaves, even if he is cut up, even if he is Goses.</p>
<p class="bas indent2"><span class="nm">1.</span>This opposes Chachamim, who say that he is forbidden to touch (or be in an Ohel with) a Goses!</p>
<p class="bas indent1"><span class="nm">(o)</span><span class="cl">Answer:</span> Even though a Goses is not Metamei, a Kohen (or Nazir) transgresses for (touching or being in an Ohel with) him.</p>

<p class="bas subject"><span class="nm">3)</span>AN INCOMPLETE <i>MES</i></p>
<p class="bas indent1"><span class="nm">(a)</span><span class="cl">(Rav Chisda):</span> A Kohen may not be Metamei to bury his father if the head was cut off, because it says "for his father" - when his father is complete.</p>
<p class="bas indent1"><span class="nm">(b)</span><span class="cl">Question (Rav Hamnuna):</span> Does this apply even if he was beheaded in a valley of bandits?</p>
<p class="bas indent1"><span class="nm">(c)</span><span class="cl">Answer (Rav Chisda):</span> I did not discuss a Mes Mitzvah (a corpse that no one else can bury). A Kohen may be Metamei for a Mes Mitzvah even if it is not a relative, all the more so for his father!</p>
<p class="bas indent1"><span class="nm">(d)</span><span class="cl">Question:</span> This is not a Mes Mitzvah!</p>
<p class="bas indent2"><span class="nm">1.</span><span class="cl">(Beraisa):</span> A Mes Mitzvah is one with no one (else) to bury it;</p>
<p class="bas indent3"><span class="nm">i.</span>If he calls and people answer, it is not a Mes Mitzvah.</p>
<p class="bas indent2"><span class="nm">2.</span>Since the son of the Mes is here, this is not a Mes Mitzvah (he must hire others to bury him)!</p>
<p class="bas indent1"><span class="nm">(e)</span><span class="cl">Answer:</span> Since the Mes is in a valley (and others are not around), it is as if there is no one else to bury him.</p>
<p class="bas indent1"><span class="nm">(f)</span><span class="cl">Question (Beraisa):</span> "For her (his sister), he (a Kohen) will be Metamei", but not for her limbs.</p>
<p class="bas indent2"><span class="nm">1.</span>He may not be Metamei for a limb that separated from his father in his father's lifetime, but he may return for a bone the size of a barley seed.</p>
<p class="bas indent2"><span class="nm">2.</span><span class="cl">Inference:</span> The Mes was lacking (a bone), and he was permitted to be Metamei for it (and becomes Tamei again for the remaining bone)!</p>
<p class="bas indent1"><span class="nm">(g)</span><span class="cl">Answer:</span> The Beraisa is like R. Yehudah (but Chachamim permit him to be Metamei only for a complete Mes).</p>
<p class="bas indent2"><span class="nm">1.</span><span class="cl">(Beraisa - R. Yehudah):</span> "For her he will be Metamei" - for her, but not for her limbs</p>
<p class="bas indent3"><span class="nm">i.</span>He may not be Metamei for a limb that separated from his father while alive, but he may be Metamei for a limb that separated from his father after death.</p>
<p class="bas indent1"><span class="nm">(h)</span><span class="cl">Question (Rav Kahana's Beraisa - R. Eliezer ben Yakov):</span> "For her he will be Metamei" - for her, but not for limbs. This excludes a k'Zayis of flesh of a Mes, a k'Zayis of Netzel (flesh of a corpse that dissolved and then coagulated), and a large spoonful of a decomposed corpse.</p>
<p class="bas indent2"><span class="nm">1.</span><span class="cl">Suggestion:</span> Perhaps he may not be Metamei for her spine, skull, or bones comprising the majority of the stature (i.e. three bones out of the shins and thighs) or of the number (of bones of the body, 248)!</p>
<p class="bas indent2"><span class="nm">2.</span><span class="cl">Rejection:</span> The repetition "say... and you will say" permits becoming Tamei for these.</p>
