<p class="bas indent1"><span class="nm">(a)</span><span class="cl">(Mishnah - R. Shimon):</span> At first, they used to call such people gatherers of Shemitah Peros....</p>
<p class="bas indent1"><span class="nm">(b)</span><span class="cl">Question:</span> What does this mean?</p>
<p class="bas indent1"><span class="nm">(c)</span><span class="cl">Answer #1 (Rav Yehudah):</span> At first, they used to say that gatherers of Shemitah Peros are Kesherim (they do so to eat it), but Socharei Shemitah are disqualified;</p>
<p class="bas indent2"><span class="nm">1.</span>It became rampant that people would say (to am Oni (poor person)) 'take this money and gather Peros for me';</p>
<p class="bas indent2"><span class="nm">2.</span><span class="cl">Version #1 (Rashi):</span> Chachamim then decreed that also gatherers are Socharei Shemitah (since they gathered with intent to sell), and are disqualified.</p>
<p class="bas indent2"><span class="nm">3.</span><span class="cl">Version #2 (Ramah):</span> Chachamim then called the Aniyim Socharei Shemitah (since they picked the Peros in order to sell it to the gatherers) and disqualified them.</p>
<p class="bas indent1"><span class="nm">(d)</span><span class="cl">Objection (Bnei Rachbah - Mishnah):</span> After <i>extortionists</i> became rampant...</p>
<p class="bas indent2"><span class="nm">1.</span>According to Rav Yehudah, it should say 'after <i>merchants</i> became rampant'!</p>
<p class="bas indent1"><span class="nm">(e)</span><span class="cl">Answer #2 (Bnei Rachbah):</span> At first, they used to say that gatherers and Socharim of Shemitah are both disqualified;</p>
<p class="bas indent2"><span class="nm">1.</span>'After extortionists became rampant' refers to Arnona (the king demands a certain amount of Peros from each field), they declared that gatherers are Kesherim but Socharim are still disqualified;</p>
<p class="bas indent3"><span class="nm">i.</span>R. Yanai announced 'seed the land in Shemitah due to Arnona' (we may be lenient, for Shemitah is only mid'Rabanan nowadays. Alternatively, there is mortal danger if they cannot pay what the king demands.)</p>
<p class="bas indent1"><span class="nm">(f)</span>R. Chiya bar Zarnuki and R. Shimon ben Yehotzadak were going to Asya to (consider whether or not to) be Me'aber the (coming) year. Reish Lakish saw them and accompanied them to see how it is done.</p>
<p class="bas indent1"><span class="nm">(g)</span>On the way, he saw a man plowing (it was Shemitah). He said 'this must be a Kohen plowing in Shemitah.'</p>
<p class="bas indent2"><span class="nm">1.</span><span class="cl">R. Chiya and R. Shimon:</span> Perhaps it is for the sake of Arnona (Rashi - or he is a sharecropper in a Nochri's field).</p>
<p class="bas indent1"><span class="nm">(h)</span>Reish Lakish also saw a man pruning a vineyard. He said 'this must be a Kohen pruning in Shemitah.'</p>
<p class="bas indent2"><span class="nm">1.</span><span class="cl">R. Chiya and R. Shimon:</span> Perhaps he needs the vines to tie the beam in his olivepress.</p>
<p class="bas indent1"><span class="nm">(i)</span><span class="cl">Reish Lakish:</span> He knows his intention!</p>
<p class="bas indent2"><span class="nm">1.</span><span class="cl">Question:</span> Which man did Reish Lakish see first?</p>
<p class="bas indent3"><span class="nm">i.</span>It cannot be the man plowing, for then Reish Lakish would not have accused the man pruning. He could have assumed that it is for Arnona!</p>
<p class="bas indent2"><span class="nm">2.</span><span class="cl">Answer:</span> He first saw the man pruning.</p>
<p class="bas indent2"><span class="nm">3.</span><span class="cl">Question:</span> Why did he assume that he was a Kohen?</p>
<p class="bas indent2"><span class="nm">4.</span><span class="cl">Answer:</span> Kohanim were suspected of transgressing Shemitah;</p>
<p class="bas indent3"><span class="nm">i.</span><span class="cl">(Beraisa):</span> If a Se'ah of Terumah fell into 100 Se'im of Shemitah Peros, it is Batul (a non- Kohen may eat it like regular Shemitah);</p>
<p class="bas indent3"><span class="nm">ii.</span>If it fell into less than 100 Se'im, we must let the entire mixture rot.</p>
<p class="bas indent3"><span class="nm">iii.</span><span class="cl">Question:</span> Why must it rot? We should sell the mixture to Kohanim, without charging for the value of the Terumah. They will eat it with the stringencies of Terumah and Shemitah!</p>
<p class="bas indent3"><span class="nm">iv.</span><span class="cl">Answer (Rav Chiya):</span> This teaches that Kohanim were suspected of transgressing Shemitah (therefore, we do not give Shemitah Peros to them).</p>
<p class="bas indent1"><span class="nm">(j)</span><span class="cl">R. Chiya and R. Shimon:</span> Our companion is quarrelsome!</p>
<p class="bas indent1"><span class="nm">(k)</span>When they reached Asya, they went up to the roof and took the ladder (so Reish Lakish could not follow them).</p>
<p class="bas indent1"><span class="nm">(l)</span><span class="cl">Reish Lakish (to R. Yochanan):</span> Are people suspected of transgressing Shemitah (they defend transgressors!) Kesherim to be Me'aber the year?</p>
<p class="bas indent1"><span class="nm">(m)</span><span class="cl">Retraction (Reish Lakish):</span> This is not difficult. They may participate, just like three cattle shepherds did (18b);</p>
<p class="bas indent2"><span class="nm">1.</span>Chachamim rely on their own calculations to decide whether we should be Me'aber the year.</p>
<p class="bas indent1"><span class="nm">(n)</span><span class="cl">Retraction (Reish Lakish):</span> Really, this is a problem! Even though Chachamim rely on their own calculation, three Kosher judges are required (to begin), and not Kesher (a band of) Resha'im!</p>
<p class="bas indent1"><span class="nm">(o)</span><span class="cl">R. Yochanan:</span> That is improper (to call them Resha'im)!</p>
<p class="bas indent2"><span class="nm">1.</span><span class="cl">R. Chiya and R. Shimon complained to R. Yochanan:</span> Reish Lakish considered us like shepherds, and you were silent (until he called us Resha'im)?!</p>
<p class="bas indent2"><span class="nm">2.</span><span class="cl">R. Yochanan:</span> What should I have said?</p>
<p class="bas subject"><span class="nm">2)</span>SHEVNA</p>
<p class="bas indent1"><span class="nm">(a)</span><span class="cl">Question:</span> What is 'Kesher Resha'im'?</p>
<p class="bas indent1"><span class="nm">(b)</span><span class="cl">Answer:</span> Shevna (who was appointed over the house of Chizkiyah ha'Melech) would expound in front of 130,000 people, and Chizkiyah in front of 110,000;</p>
<p class="bas indent2"><span class="nm">1.</span>When Sancheriv besieged Yerushalayim, Shevna sent to him 'Shevna and his followers surrender to you. Chizkiyah and his followers do not.' We learn from "ha'Resha'im Yidrechun Keshes" (Lashon ha'Ra is like arrows).</p>
<p class="bas indent2"><span class="nm">2.</span>Chizkiyah feared lest Hash-m follow the majority. Since they will fall to the enemy, also we will!</p>
<p class="bas indent2"><span class="nm">3.</span>Hash-m reassured him (through Yeshayah ha'Navi) "Lo Somerun Kesher l'Chol Asher Yomar ha'Am ha'Zeh Kesher";</p>
<p class="bas indent2"><span class="nm">4.</span>"Kesher" refers to 'Kesher Resha'im.' They are not counted when determining the majority.</p>
<p class="bas indent1"><span class="nm">(c)</span>Shevna went to dig a grave for himself in the burial place of Beis David (to show that he considers himself to be king). Hash-m told him (through Yeshayah) "Mah Lecha Fo... Hash-m Metaltelcha Taltelah Gaver" (He will drag you like a man).</p>
<p class="bas indent1"><span class="nm">(d)</span><span class="cl">(Rav):</span> It is worse for a man to be dragged around than a woman (Iyun Yakov - this opposes his nature. Man was created from the ground.)</p>
<p class="bas indent1"><span class="nm">(e)</span><span class="cl">(R. Yosi b'Rebbi Chanina):</span> "V'Otecha Ato" teaches that he became a Metzora, about which it similarly says "v'Al Safam Yateh."</p>
<p class="bas indent1"><span class="nm">(f)</span><span class="cl">(Beraisa):</span> "Yitznofecha Tzefenah Kador" - he wanted to disgrace his master's house, therefore his honor was turned to shame.</p>
<p class="bas indent1"><span class="nm">(g)</span>When he left Yerushalayim to make Shalom with Sancheriv, Gabri'el closed the door in front of his camp.</p>
<p class="bas bbbline">26b----------------------------------------26b</p>
<p class="bas indent2"><span class="nm">1.</span><span class="cl">Sancheriv's men:</span> Where are your followers?</p>
<p class="bas indent2"><span class="nm">2.</span><span class="cl">Shevna:</span> They reconsidered.</p>
<p class="bas indent2"><span class="nm">3.</span><span class="cl">Sancheriv's men:</span> You mock us!</p>
<p class="bas indent2"><span class="nm">4.</span>They pierced his ankles and hung him from the tails of their horses; they dragged him on thorns.</p>
<p class="bas indent1"><span class="nm">(h)</span><span class="cl">(R. Elazar):</span> Shevna indulged in pleasures. It says "Lech Ba El ha'Sochen", like it says "va'Tehi Lo Sochenes."</p>
<p class="bas indent1"><span class="nm">(i)</span><span class="cl">(Rav Yehudah or Eina):</span> "Ki ha'Shasos Yeharesun Tzadik Mah Pa'al" - if Chizkiyah and his followers would be trampled, where is the reward for their righteousness?</p>
<p class="bas indent1"><span class="nm">(j)</span><span class="cl">(The other of Rav Yehudah and Eina):</span> If the Beis ha'Mikdash would be destroyed, where is the reward for their righteousness?</p>
<p class="bas indent1"><span class="nm">(k)</span><span class="cl">(Ula):</span> If the Machshavos (plans) of that Rasha (Shevna) will not be foiled, where is the reward for Tzadikim?</p>
<p class="bas indent1"><span class="nm">(l)</span><span class="cl">Question:</span> According to Ula, we understand why it says "ha'Shasos Yeharesun."</p>
<p class="bas indent2"><span class="nm">1.</span>We also understand according to the one who said 'if the Beis ha'Mikdash would be destroyed';</p>
<p class="bas indent3"><span class="nm">i.</span><span class="cl">(Mishnah):</span> There was a rock called Shesiyah (under the Aron) from the days of the early Nevi'im.</p>
<p class="bas indent2"><span class="nm">2.</span>However,  according to the one who said 'if Chizkiyah and his followers would be trampled', where do we find a Tzadik called 'Shesos'?</p>
<p class="bas indent1"><span class="nm">(m)</span><span class="cl">Answer #1:</span> "La'Shem Metukei Eretz va'Yashes Aleihem Tevel."</p>
<p class="bas indent1"><span class="nm">(n)</span><span class="cl">Answer #2:</span> "Hifli Etzah Higdil Toshiyah."</p>
<p class="bas indent1"><span class="nm">(o)</span><span class="cl">(R. Chanan):</span> Torah is called Shesiyah because it saps one's strength;</p>
<p class="bas indent2"><span class="nm">1.</span>Alternatively, it is called Shesiyah because it was given b'Chashai (quietly), due to the Satan.</p>
<p class="bas indent2"><span class="nm">2.</span>Alternatively, it is called Shesiyah because it is Tohu (non-physical) and the world is Meshusas (based) on it.</p>
<p class="bas indent1"><span class="nm">(p)</span><span class="cl">Version #1 - Rashi - (Ula):</span> Worry about finances makes one forget (everything, even) Torah - "Mefer Machshevos Arumim v'Lo Sa'asenah Yedeihem Tushiyah."</p>
<p class="bas indent1"><span class="nm">(q)</span><span class="cl">Version #2 - Ramah - (Ula):</span> Planning (when one will accomplish something) inhibits one from fulfilling it, even Torah - "Mefer..." (end of Version #2)</p>
<p class="bas indent1"><span class="nm">(r)</span><span class="cl">(Rabah):</span> If one learns Lishmah, planning will not harm his Torah - "Rabos Machashavos b'Lev Ish va'Atzas Hash-m Hi Sakum."</p>
<p class="bas subject"><span class="nm">3)</span>ANNOUNCING THAT SOMEONE IS DISQUALIFIED</p>
<p class="bas indent1"><span class="nm">(a)</span><span class="cl">(Mishnah - R. Yehudah):</span> When is this?...</p>
<p class="bas indent1"><span class="nm">(b)</span><span class="cl">(R. Avahu):</span> The Halachah follows R. Yehudah.</p>
<p class="bas indent1"><span class="nm">(c)</span><span class="cl">(R. Avahu):</span> All of them must be announced by Beis Din (to be disqualified. Until this they are Kosher).</p>
<p class="bas indent1"><span class="nm">(d)</span><span class="cl">(Rav Acha or Ravina):</span> A shepherd must be announced.</p>
<p class="bas indent1"><span class="nm">(e)</span><span class="cl">(The other of Rav Acha and Ravina):</span> He need not be announced.</p>
<p class="bas indent1"><span class="nm">(f)</span><span class="cl">Question:</span> According to the opinion that he need not be announced, we understand why Rav Yehuda taught that a shepherd is assumed to be disqualified;</p>
<p class="bas indent2"><span class="nm">1.</span>However, according to the opinion that he must be announced, why is this? (He should be Kosher until Beis Din disqualifies him!)</p>
<p class="bas indent1"><span class="nm">(g)</span><span class="cl">Answer:</span> Rav Yehudah means that Beis Din may announce about him (without evidence), and assume that he should be disqualified.</p>
<p class="bas indent1"><span class="nm">(h)</span>Two thieves were signed on a gift document; Rav Papa bar Shmuel thought to honor the document, because no announcement was made about the thieves.</p>
<p class="bas indent1"><span class="nm">(i)</span><span class="cl">(Rava):</span> No. Announcement is only for thieves mid'Rabanan. Thieves mid'Oraisa do not need announcement.</p>
<p class="bas subject"><span class="nm">4)</span>TRANSGRESSIONS THAT DISQUALIFY SOMEONE</p>
<p class="bas indent1"><span class="nm">(a)</span><span class="cl">(Rav Nachman):</span> Those who consume 'Devar Acher' (take Tzedakah from Nochrim, which desecrates Hash-m's name) are disqualified from testifying.</p>
<p class="bas indent2"><span class="nm">1.</span>This is only if they take in public. If they take privately, they are Kesherim.</p>
<p class="bas indent2"><span class="nm">2.</span>Even if they take in public, they are disqualified only if they could take privately but do not.</p>
<p class="bas indent2"><span class="nm">3.</span>If they have no choice but to take in public, this is their livelihood, and they are Kesherim.</p>
<p class="bas indent1"><span class="nm">(b)</span><span class="cl">(Rav Nachman):</span> One who is suspected of sexual immorality is Kosher for testimony.</p>
<p class="bas indent1"><span class="nm">(c)</span><span class="cl">Objection (Rav Sheshes):</span> We give forty lashes (for bad repute). Surely he is disqualified!</p>
<p class="bas indent1"><span class="nm">(d)</span><span class="cl">(Rava):</span> Rav Nachman admits that he is disqualified to testify about a woman.</p>
<p class="bas indent1"><span class="nm">(e)</span><span class="cl">(Ravina):</span> Rava refers to testifying (alone) that a man died (to permit his widow to remarry). He is Kosher to testify that she became Mekudeshes.</p>
<p class="bas indent1"><span class="nm">(f)</span><span class="cl">Objection:</span> This is obvious!</p>
<p class="bas indent1"><span class="nm">(g)</span><span class="cl">Answer:</span> One might have thought that he prefers that she be (established to be) married to increase his enjoyment - "Mayim Genuvim Yimtaku" - Ravina teaches that this is not so. When she is considered single, she is more available to him.</p>
<p class="bas indent1"><span class="nm">(h)</span><span class="cl">(Rav Nachman):</span> A thief of Nisan (harvest time) and Tishrei (time of gathering) is not considered a thief.</p>
<p class="bas indent2"><span class="nm">1.</span>This refers only to a sharecropper who takes a small amount of something that need not be processed further (he considers himself like a worker who may eat while he works. Really, since he receives a portion of the Peros, he is not entitled to this.)</p>
<p class="bas indent1"><span class="nm">(i)</span>Rav Zvid had two farmhands (who do not receive a portion of the Peros). One stole a Kav of barley, and the other stole a cluster of dates. Rav Zvid disqualified both of them.</p>
<p class="bas indent1"><span class="nm">(j)</span>Burial workers buried someone on Shavu'os (on the first day of Yom Tov). Rav Papa excommunicated them and disqualified them from testifying;</p>
<p class="bas indent1"><span class="nm">(k)</span>Rav Huna brei d'Rav Yehoshua was Machshir them for testimony.</p>
<p class="bas indent2"><span class="nm">1.</span><span class="cl">Rav Papa:</span> They are Resha'im!</p>
<p class="bas indent2"><span class="nm">2.</span><span class="cl">Rav Huna brei d'Rav Yehoshua:</span> They thought that they were doing a Mitzvah.</p>
<p class="bas indent2"><span class="nm">3.</span><span class="cl">Rav Papa:</span> I put them in Niduy (and they continued to bury on Yom Tov)!</p>
<p class="bas indent2"><span class="nm">4.</span><span class="cl">Rav Huna brei d'Rav Yehoshua:</span> They reasoned that the Mitzvah to bury the dead overrides Yom Tov, and your Niduy was for atonement (because they had to desecrate Yom Tov).</p>
