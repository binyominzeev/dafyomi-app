<p class="bas subject"><span class="nm">1)</span>PICKING THE BEIS DIN</p>
<p class="bas indent1"><span class="nm">(a)</span><span class="cl">(Mishnah - R. Meir):</span> Monetary cases require three judges. Each (party) picks one (this will be explained), and both agree upon a third;</p>
<p class="bas indent1"><span class="nm">(b)</span>Chachamim say, the two judges (picked by the two parties) agree upon a third.</p>
<p class="bas indent1"><span class="nm">(c)</span>R. Meir says, either party can disqualify a judge picked by the other;</p>
<p class="bas indent1"><span class="nm">(d)</span>Chachamim say, this is only if he can prove that he is a relative or invalid to judge. One cannot disqualify a Kosher or Mumcheh judge.</p>
<p class="bas indent1"><span class="nm">(e)</span>R. Meir says, either party can disqualify the other's witnesses;</p>
<p class="bas indent1"><span class="nm">(f)</span>Chachamim say, to do so he must prove that they are relatives or invalid witnesses.</p>
<p class="bas indent1"><span class="nm">(g)</span><span class="cl">(Gemara) Version #1 (Rashi) Question:</span> Why does it say that each (party) picks one (Beis Din, and then they pick a third)? Three judges suffice!</p>
<p class="bas indent1"><span class="nm">(h)</span><span class="cl">Version #2 (Tosfos) Question:</span> Why <i>must</i> they first select different Batei Din? It suffices to pick only the third (the one that they agree to)! (end of Version #2)</p>
<p class="bas indent1"><span class="nm">(i)</span><span class="cl">Answer #1:</span> It means, <i>if</i> each picks a different Beis Din, they must pick a third Beis Din together.</p>
<p class="bas indent2"><span class="nm">1.</span><span class="cl">Question:</span> Can the borrower really reject the Beis Din of the lender?</p>
<p class="bas indent3"><span class="nm">i.</span><span class="cl">(R. Elazar):</span> The lender can force the borrower to go to the Beis ha'Va'ad (a better Beis Din in another city), but the borrower cannot force the lender (if the lender wants to go to a Beis Din in his city).</p>
<p class="bas indent2"><span class="nm">2.</span><span class="cl">Answer #1:</span> The case is like R. Yochanan said (to answer a different question). He can reject only a Beis Din like those of Surya (i.e. it is unlearned!)</p>
<p class="bas indent2"><span class="nm">3.</span><span class="cl">Answer #2 (Rav Papa):</span> Even if the Beis Din is Mumcheh, if both Batei Din are in the same area (Tosfos - not far apart), like the Batei Din of Rav Huna and Rav Chisda, the borrower can reject the lender's choice, for this is not a burden.</p>
<p class="bas indent1"><span class="nm">(j)</span><span class="cl">Objection #1 (Mishnah - Chachamim):</span> The two judges agree upon a third.</p>
<p class="bas indent2"><span class="nm">1.</span>If the first Batei Din were rejected, why do these judges pick the third?</p>
<p class="bas indent1"><span class="nm">(k)</span><span class="cl">Objection #2:</span> The words of the Mishnah imply that each party <i>must</i> pick one!</p>
<p class="bas indent1"><span class="nm">(l)</span><span class="cl">Answer #2:</span> It means, each party picks one <i>judge</i>, and both parties agree upon a third judge.</p>
<p class="bas indent1"><span class="nm">(m)</span><span class="cl">Question:</span> Why do they do it this way? (Both parties should agree to all three judges!)</p>
<p class="bas indent1"><span class="nm">(n)</span><span class="cl">Version #1 (Rashi) Answer (R. Zeira):</span> Each party will think 'the judge that I picked tried his best to be Mezakeh me', so he will accept the verdict.</p>
<p class="bas indent1"><span class="nm">(o)</span><span class="cl">Version #2 (Tosfos) Answer (R. Zeira):</span> Since each party had equal input in picking the judges, the judges will strive to be Mezakeh both sides equally, and they will reach the correct verdict.</p>
<p class="bas indent1"><span class="nm">(p)</span><span class="cl">(Mishnah - Chachamim):</span> The two judges agree upon a third.</p>
<p class="bas indent1"><span class="nm">(q)</span><span class="cl">Suggestion:</span> They argue about Rav Yehudah's law.</p>
<p class="bas indent2"><span class="nm">1.</span><span class="cl">(Rav Yehudah):</span> A witness should not sign a document until he knows the other witnesses (lest one of them is a relative or invalid witness, and this will be Mevatel the testimony).</p>
<p class="bas indent2"><span class="nm">2.</span>Chachamim hold like Rav Yehudah. (Likewise, one should not judge a case until he knows the other judges, lest one of them is a relative or invalid, and this will disqualify the verdict). R. Meir argues with Rav Yehudah.</p>
<p class="bas indent1"><span class="nm">(r)</span><span class="cl">Rejection:</span> No, all agree with Rav Yehudah. All require that the judges agree to each other;</p>
<p class="bas indent2"><span class="nm">1.</span>They argue about whether the parties must agree to the judges. R. Meir says that they must, and Chachamim say that they need not.</p>
<p class="bas indent1"><span class="nm">(s)</span><span class="cl">Support (for Rav Yehudah - Beraisa):</span> Nekiyei ha'Da'as (very pious people) of Yerushalayim would not sign documents until they knew the other witnesses, they would not judge until they knew the other judges, and they would not sit to eat until they knew the others at the meal.</p>
<p class="bas subject"><span class="nm">2)</span>DISQUALIFYING JUDGES</p>
<p class="bas indent1"><span class="nm">(a)</span><span class="cl">(Mishnah - R. Meir):</span> Either party can disqualify a judge picked by the other.</p>
<p class="bas indent1"><span class="nm">(b)</span><span class="cl">Question:</span> Can he really do this (without good reason)?!</p>
<p class="bas indent1"><span class="nm">(c)</span><span class="cl">Answer (R. Yochanan):</span> He can disqualify judges of Batei Din of Surya (i.e. who are unqualified).</p>
<p class="bas indent1"><span class="nm">(d)</span><span class="cl">Inference:</span> He cannot disqualify qualified judges.</p>
<p class="bas indent1"><span class="nm">(e)</span><span class="cl">Question (Mishnah - Chachamim):</span> To disqualify him, he must prove that he is a relative or invalid to judge. He cannot disqualify a Kosher or Mumcheh judge.'</p>
<p class="bas indent2"><span class="nm">1.</span><span class="cl">Inference:</span> R. Meir says that he can disqualify a Mumcheh!</p>
<p class="bas indent1"><span class="nm">(f)</span><span class="cl">Answer:</span> Chachamim mean that a Kosher judge (i.e. he is not a relative or disqualified from judging, even if we do not know whether or not he is learned) is like an established Mumcheh, and one cannot disqualify him.</p>
<p class="bas indent1"><span class="nm">(g)</span><span class="cl">Question (against R. Yochanan - Beraisa):</span> Chachamim told R. Meir 'one cannot disqualify Mumchim!'</p>
<p class="bas indent1"><span class="nm">(h)</span><span class="cl">Answer:</span> It means, one cannot disqualify judges that many people (i.e. of Surya) accepted upon themselves to consider them like Mumchim.</p>
<p class="bas indent1"><span class="nm">(i)</span><span class="cl">Support (for R. Yochanan - Beraisa - R. Meir):</span> A party may reject the other's judges, unless he accepted in front of a Beis Din of Mumchim. (If one could reject Mumchim, he could retract his acceptance!)</p>
<p class="bas indent1"><span class="nm">(j)</span><span class="cl">Question:</span> Witnesses are like Mumchim (they are not disqualified due to ignorance), and R. Meir says (in our Mishnah) that either party can disqualify the other's witnesses!</p>
<p class="bas indent1"><span class="nm">(k)</span><span class="cl">Answer #1:</span> Reish Lakish explained, the awesome R. Meir would never say this!</p>
<p class="bas indent2"><span class="nm">1.</span>Rather, R. Meir says that either party can disqualify the other's <i>witness</i>!</p>
<p class="bas indent2"><span class="nm">2.</span><span class="cl">Question:</span> What could one witness do if he were not disqualified?</p>
<p class="bas indent3"><span class="nm">i.</span><span class="cl">Suggestion:</span> He obligates paying.</p>
<p class="bas indent3"><span class="nm">ii.</span><span class="cl">Rejection:</span> Two witnesses are required for this!</p>
<p class="bas indent3"><span class="nm">iii.</span><span class="cl">Suggestion:</span> He obligates an oath.</p>
<p class="bas indent3"><span class="nm">iv.</span><span class="cl">Rejection:</span> For this he is like two witnesses, i.e. the other party cannot disqualify him!</p>
<p class="bas indent2"><span class="nm">3.</span><span class="cl">Answer:</span> He could have obligated money. The case is, the other party accepted to believe the witness like two witnesses.</p>
<p class="bas indent2"><span class="nm">4.</span><span class="cl">Question:</span> If so, (in the Mishnah) R. Meir says that he can retract from his acceptance, and Chachamim say that he cannot. Another Mishnah teaches this!</p>
<p class="bas indent3"><span class="nm">i.</span><span class="cl">(Mishnah - R. Meir):</span> If one party said 'you may use my father (or your father, or three cattle shepherds) to judge our case', he may retract;</p>
<p class="bas indent3"><span class="nm">ii.</span>Chachamim say, he may not retract.</p>
<p class="bas bbbline">23b----------------------------------------23b</p>
<p class="bas indent3"><span class="nm">iii.</span><span class="cl">(Rav Dimi brei d'Rav Nachman):</span> We discuss accepting his (or his opponent's father) to be one of the judges. (Since he is Pasul mid'Oraisa, R. Meir says that he can retract. The same applies here!)</p>
<p class="bas indent2"><span class="nm">5.</span><span class="cl">Answer:</span> They must argue in both cases.</p>
<p class="bas indent3"><span class="nm">i.</span>Had they argued only about accepting a father to judge, one might have thought that only there Chachamim say that he cannot retract, for he is valid to judge others, but Chachamim admit that one may retract from accepting one witness like two witnesses (for he is never believed like two);</p>
<p class="bas indent3"><span class="nm">ii.</span>Had they argued only about believing one witness like two, one might have thought that R. Meir admits that one cannot retract from accepting a father to judge (for he is valid to judge others).</p>
<p class="bas indent1"><span class="nm">(l)</span><span class="cl">Objection:</span> Since the Reisha of our Mishnah says that he may reject the other's <i>judge</i> (singular), and the Seifa says that he may reject the other's witness<i>es</i>, surely, it discusses rejecting two witnesses!</p>
<p class="bas indent1"><span class="nm">(m)</span><span class="cl">Answer #2 (R. Elazar):</span> The case is, a party (Reuven) and one witness (David) are believed to say that the other's (Shimon's) witnesses are invalid.</p>
<p class="bas indent2"><span class="nm">1.</span><span class="cl">Objection:</span> Surely, Reuven is not believed. He is Noge'a (partial, he may gain by saying this)!</p>
<p class="bas indent2"><span class="nm">2.</span><span class="cl">Answer (Rav Acha brei d'Rav Ika):</span> The case is, Reuven explains why the witnesses are invalid.</p>
<p class="bas indent2"><span class="nm">3.</span><span class="cl">Question:</span> What does he say?</p>
<p class="bas indent3"><span class="nm">i.</span>Surely, he is not believed to say that they are thieves. He is Noge'a!</p>
<p class="bas indent2"><span class="nm">4.</span><span class="cl">Answer:</span> He says that their lineage disqualifies them from testifying (i.e. they are slaves).</p>
<p class="bas indent3"><span class="nm">i.</span>R. Meir says that Reuven's testimony is primarily about lineage, and automatically the witnesses are disqualified;</p>
<p class="bas indent3"><span class="nm">ii.</span>Chachamim say that since his testimony helps himself, he is Noge'a.</p>
<p class="bas indent1"><span class="nm">(n)</span><span class="cl">Answer #3 (Rav Dimi):</span> The case is, Shimon said that he has two pairs of witnesses;</p>
<p class="bas indent2"><span class="nm">1.</span><span class="cl">Version #1 (our text):</span> R. Meir says that Shimon must defend his claim (therefore, Reuven can (Ramah; Tosfos - join David to) disqualify one pair of Shimon's witnesses. Reuven is not Noge'a, for in any case Shimon must bring other witnesses);</p>
<p class="bas indent2"><span class="nm">2.</span>Chachamim say, Shimon need not defend his claim. (Therefore, Reuven is Noge'a, and he cannot (join to) disqualify witnesses.)</p>
<p class="bas indent2"><span class="nm">3.</span><span class="cl">Version #2 (Rashi):</span> R. Meir says that Shimon need not defend his claim (therefore, Reuven can join to disqualify one pair of Shimon's witnesses, since it suffices for Shimon to bring the other pair of witnesses);</p>
<p class="bas indent2"><span class="nm">4.</span>Chachamim say, Shimon must defend his claim (therefore, Reuven cannot join to disqualify witnesses, for this would destroy Shimon's claim, Reuven is Noge'a). (end of Version #2)</p>
<p class="bas indent2"><span class="nm">5.</span>All agree that if Shimon never claimed to have two pairs of witnesses, Reuven cannot join to disqualify witnesses.</p>
<p class="bas indent1"><span class="nm">(o)</span><span class="cl">Question (Rav Ami and Rav Asi):</span> If Shimon has only one pair of witnesses, what is the law (according to R. Meir)?</p>
<p class="bas indent2"><span class="nm">1.</span><span class="cl">Question:</span> We said that all agree in this case that Reuven cannot (join to) disqualify witnesses!</p>
<p class="bas indent2"><span class="nm">2.</span><span class="cl">Answer:</span> The question is, if one pair of witnesses was later found (undisputedly) to be relatives or invalid witnesses, what is the law?</p>
<p class="bas indent1"><span class="nm">(p)</span><span class="cl">Version #1 - Rashi - Answer (R. Yochanan or Rav Ashi):</span> We already accepted the testimony of the first witnesses (Reuven and David, who disqualified Shimon's witnesses. Reuven was not Noge'a at the time).</p>
<p class="bas indent1"><span class="nm">(q)</span><span class="cl">Version #2 - Answer (R. Yochanan or Rav Ashi):</span> We already accepted the testimony of the first witnesses (who testified for Shimon. Since the other pair was disqualified, Reuven is Noge'a, so he cannot (Ramah; Rashi - join to) disqualify the Kosher pair.) (end of Version #2)</p>
<p class="bas indent1"><span class="nm">(r)</span><span class="cl">Suggestion:</span> R. Meir and Chachamim argue as Rebbi and R. Shimon ben Gamliel argue.</p>
<p class="bas indent2"><span class="nm">1.</span><span class="cl">(Beraisa - Rebbi):</span> If Levi says that he has a document and a Chazakah for his land, he must produce the document;</p>
<p class="bas indent2"><span class="nm">2.</span>R. Shimon ben Gamliel says, he brings witnesses of Chazakah.</p>
<p class="bas indent2"><span class="nm">3.</span><span class="cl">Question:</span> Would R. Shimon ben Gamliel say that the document is not enough?!</p>
<p class="bas indent2"><span class="nm">4.</span><span class="cl">Answer:</span> No. He means, he may bring witnesses of Chazakah <i>or</i> the document.</p>
<p class="bas indent1"><span class="nm">(s)</span><span class="cl">Rejection:</span> Granted, R. Shimon ben Gamliel must hold like Chachamim, but Chachamim could hold like Rebbi;</p>
<p class="bas indent2"><span class="nm">1.</span>Rebbi said that one must defend both his claims only regarding a Chazakah based on a document. Here, neither pair of witnesses depends on the other, so he need not defend both claims!</p>
