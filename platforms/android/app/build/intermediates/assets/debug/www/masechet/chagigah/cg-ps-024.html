<p class="bas indent1"><span class="nm">(a)</span><span class="cl">(Beraisa):</span> The source that Kodesh has Revi'i is a Kal v'Chomer.</p>
<p class="bas indent2"><span class="nm">1.</span>A person who is Mechusar Kipurim is permitted to eat Terumah, yet is Pasul for Kodesh.</p>
<p class="bas indent2"><span class="nm">2.</span>If so, since a Tum'ah level of Shlishi is Pasul for Terumah, then certainly it will make a Revi'i for Kodesh.</p>
<p class="bas indent2"><span class="nm">3.</span>If a Kal v'Chomer is used to make Revi'i for Kodesh, how do we know from the Torah that there is Shlishi for Kodesh?</p>
<p class="bas indent2"><span class="nm">4.</span>We know Shlishi for Kodesh from the verse, "Any flesh [of Shelamim, which is Kodesh] touched by anything Tamei may not be eaten" (Vayikra 7:19).</p>
<p class="bas indent3"><span class="nm">i.</span>"Anything Tamei" refers even to a Sheni l'Tum'ah.</p>
<p class="bas indent3"><span class="nm">ii.</span>And the verse says that flesh of Kodesh that touches it becomes a Shlishi ("may not be eaten").</p>
<p class="bas subject"><span class="nm">2)</span>THE NINTH STRINGENCY OF <i>KODESH</i> OVER <i>TERUMAH</i>: ONE HAND IS <i>METAMEI</i> THE OTHER FOR <i>KODESH</i> BUT NOT FOR <i>TERUMAH</i></p>
<p class="bas indent1"><span class="nm">(a)</span><span class="cl">(R. Shizbi):</span> This enactment applies only when the Tahor hand is touching the Kodesh food at the time that the Tamei hand touches the Tahor hand.</p>
<p class="bas indent1"><span class="nm">(b)</span>The Tamei hand does not make the Tahor hand Tamei when the Tahor hand is not touching the food.</p>
<p class="bas indent1"><span class="nm">(c)</span><span class="cl">Question (Abaye):</span> A Beraisa contradicts this!</p>
<p class="bas indent2"><span class="nm">1.</span><span class="cl">(Rebbi):</span> A <i>dry</i> hand (with the status of Sheni l'Tum'ah) which touches the other hand makes that hand into a Sheni (with the ability to be Metamei any Kodesh that it touches and make it a Shlishi).</p>
<p class="bas indent2"><span class="nm">2.</span><span class="cl">(R. Yosi b'R. Yehudah):</span> The second hand only becomes a Shlishi (with the ability only to be Posel any Kodesh that it touches and make it a Revi'i).</p>
<p class="bas indent2"><span class="nm">3.</span>If the second hand is not touching Kodesh, then that is why the Beraisa says that the first hand is <i>dry</i>.</p>
<p class="bas indent3"><span class="nm">i.</span>It is teaching the Chidush that even though a Sheni normally cannot make another Sheni while dry, the Rabanan were strict with regard to Kodesh.</p>
<p class="bas indent2"><span class="nm">4.</span>But if the second hand <i>is</i> touching Kodesh, then why does the Beraisa have to say that the first hand is dry?</p>
<p class="bas indent3"><span class="nm">i.</span>The fear is that the first hand will touch the Kodesh food (that the second hand is holding).</p>
<p class="bas indent3"><span class="nm">ii.</span>There is no Chidush in saying that the first hand is dry, because a Sheni can certainly make Kodesh which it touches into a Shlishi without being wet!</p>
<p class="bas subject"><span class="nm">3)</span>CAN ONE PERSON'S HAND BE <i>METAMEI</i> ANOTHER PERSON'S HAND FOR <i>KODESH</i>?</p>
<p class="bas indent1"><span class="nm">(a)</span><span class="cl">(Reish Lakish):</span> This stringecy of Kodesh applies only when one person touches his own hand, but not when he touches his friend's hand.</p>
<p class="bas bbbline">24b----------------------------------------24b</p>
<p class="bas indent1"><span class="nm">(b)</span><span class="cl">(R. Yochanan):</span> Even if he touches his friend's hand, he will make it Tamei for Kodesh.</p>
<p class="bas indent2"><span class="nm">1.</span>This is only if his first hand touches his friend's hand, but not if his second hand (that was made Tamei by his first) touches his friend's hand.</p>
<p class="bas indent2"><span class="nm">2.</span>His hand will only make his friend's hand into a Shlishi (with the ability only to be Posel the Kodesh that it touches and make it a Revi'i).</p>
<p class="bas indent3"><span class="nm">i.</span>This is the subject of a Machlokes Tana'im (Rebbi and R. Yosi b'R. Yehudah in a Beraisa cited earlier).</p>
<p class="bas indent1"><span class="nm">(c)</span>R. Yochanan derives this from the repetition in the Mishnah.</p>
<p class="bas indent2"><span class="nm">1.</span>The Mishnah first says, "For Terumah, if one hand became Tamei, the other remains Tahor, while for Kodesh, one must immerse both hands."</p>
<p class="bas indent2"><span class="nm">2.</span>The Mishnah then repeats itself and says again, "Because one hand is Metamei the other for Kodesh but not for Terumah."</p>
<p class="bas indent2"><span class="nm">3.</span>It must be that the second statement is teaching that one's hand can be Metamei his friend's hand.</p>
<p class="bas indent1"><span class="nm">(d)</span>Reish Lakish changed his mind and agreed with R. Yochanan.</p>
<p class="bas subject"><span class="nm">4)</span>THE TENTH STRINGENCY OF <i>KODESH</i> OVER <i>TERUMAH</i>: ONE MAY EAT <i>TERUMAH</i> FOODS THAT ARE DRY, WITH HANDS THAT ARE <i>TAMEI</i>, BUT NOT <i>KODESH</i> FOODS</p>
<p class="bas indent1"><span class="nm">(a)</span><span class="cl">Question:</span> What is the Mishnah teaching -- it is obvious that one may not eat Kodesh foods that are dry with hands that are Tamei!?</p>
<p class="bas indent2"><span class="nm">1.</span>Kodesh foods are Mekabel Tum'ah even when dry, because of "Chibas ha'Kodesh!"</p>
<p class="bas indent1"><span class="nm">(b)</span><span class="cl">Answer:</span> It is referring to a case where one's friend (whose hands are Tahor) places the food in his mouth (or he places it in his own mouth by using a flat reed or flat spoon, which are not Mekabel Tum'ah).</p>
<p class="bas indent2"><span class="nm">1.</span>Now, he wants to eat with it a radish or onion of Chulin.</p>
<p class="bas indent2"><span class="nm">2.</span>Even though his Tamei hands will not make the Chulin food Tamei (since they are dry), the Rabanan prohibited placing that Chulin food in his mouth when he is already eating Kodesh (lest he touch the saliva in his mouth, making his Tamei hands wet, and then touch the Chulin, making it Tamei, which in turn would make the Kodesh Tamei).</p>
<p class="bas subject"><span class="nm">5)</span>THE ELEVENTH STRINGENCY OF <i>KODESH</i> OVER <i>TERUMAH</i>: AN <i>ONEN</i> AND ONE WHO IS <i>MECHUSAR KIPURIM</i> REQUIRE <i>TEVILAH</i> IN ORDER TO EAT <i>KODESH</i></p>
<p class="bas indent1"><span class="nm">(a)</span><span class="cl">Question:</span> What is the reason?</p>
<p class="bas indent1"><span class="nm">(b)</span><span class="cl">Answer:</span> Since until now they were prohibited from eating Kodesh (but permitted to eat Terumah), the Rabanan required that they immerse in order to eat Kodesh.</p>
<p class="bas subject"><span class="nm">6)</span><i>MISHNAH</i>: WAYS IN WHICH <i>TERUMAH</i> IS MORE STRINGENT THAN <i>KODESH</i></p>
<p class="bas indent1"><span class="nm">(a)</span>In Yehudah, an Am ha'Aretz is trusted the entire year with regard to the Taharah of wine and oil of Kodesh (which he designated at the time of their production to be used upon the Mizbe'ach).</p>
<p class="bas indent2"><span class="nm">1.</span>For wine and oil of Terumah, though, he is only trusted during their production seasons (the wine-press and olive- press seasons).</p>
<p class="bas indent2"><span class="nm">2.</span>If those seasons passed and the Am ha'Aretz brings a barrel of Terumah wine to the Kohen, the Kohen may not accept it.</p>
<p class="bas indent2"><span class="nm">3.</span>Rather, he (the Am ha'Aretz) leaves it until the next wine- pressing season and then gives it to the Kohen.</p>
<p class="bas indent2"><span class="nm">4.</span>If, however, the Am ha'Aretz says that he designated in the barrel some wine for Kodesh, he is trusted (and the Kohen may accept it from him at any time).</p>
<p class="bas indent1"><span class="nm">(b)</span>An Am ha'Aretz is trusted for jugs of wine and jugs of oil that are Demai (have Terumah and Chulin mixed together) during the  production seasons, and seventy days before them.</p>
