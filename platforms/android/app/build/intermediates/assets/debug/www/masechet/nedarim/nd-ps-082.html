<p class="bas subject"><span class="nm">1)</span>VOWS THAT AFFECT <i>BI'AH</i></p>
<p class="bas indent1"><span class="nm">(a)</span><span class="cl">Answer (Rav Nachman - Mishnah):</span> If she said 'I will not have Bi'ah with any Yisrael', he annuls the part of the vow relevant to him, and she is forbidden to have Bi'ah with any other Yisrael (even after she is widowed or divorced).</p>
<p class="bas indent2"><span class="nm">1.</span>If it is a vow of affliction, the vow should be annulled entirely!</p>
<p class="bas indent2"><span class="nm">2.</span><span class="cl">Conclusion:</span> Rather, it is a vow between them.</p>
<p class="bas indent1"><span class="nm">(b)</span><span class="cl">Rejection:</span> That Mishnah is like R. Yosi. We ask about Chachamim.</p>
<p class="bas indent2"><span class="nm">1.</span><span class="cl">(Rav Huna):</span> R. Yosi taught all the Mishnayos in this Perek.</p>
<p class="bas indent2"><span class="nm">2.</span><span class="cl">Question:</span> How does Rav Huna know this?</p>
<p class="bas indent2"><span class="nm">3.</span><span class="cl">Answer:</span> The Mishnah begins 'R. Yosi says...' Why does the Mishnah later say 'this is R. Yosi's opinion'? This teaches that R. Yosi taught the entire Perek.</p>
<p class="bas indent1"><span class="nm">(c)</span><span class="cl">(Shmuel):</span> A man can annul all his wife's vows, except for 'Ploni may not benefit from me.'</p>
<p class="bas indent2"><span class="nm">1.</span>He can annul 'I will not benefit from Ploni.'</p>
<p class="bas indent1"><span class="nm">(d)</span><span class="cl">Question #1 (Mishnah):</span> If she said 'Peros of this province are forbidden to me', he (cannot annul, rather he) brings to her from another province.</p>
<p class="bas indent1"><span class="nm">(e)</span><span class="cl">Answer #1 (Rav Yosef):</span> The case is, she said 'Peros of this province are forbidden to me if you bring them.' (It is possible for her to enjoy the Peros, unlike Shmuel's case 'I will not benefit from Ploni.')</p>
<p class="bas indent1"><span class="nm">(f)</span><span class="cl">Question #2 (Mishnah):</span> If she said 'Peros of this grocer are forbidden to me', he cannot annul.'</p>
<p class="bas indent1"><span class="nm">(g)</span><span class="cl">Answer #1:</span> Here also, the case is, she said '... if you bring them.'</p>
<p class="bas indent1"><span class="nm">(h)</span><span class="cl">Objection (Seifa):</span> If he gets all his Peros from this grocer, he can annul. If she stipulated '... if you bring them', why can he annul?</p>
<p class="bas indent2"><span class="nm">1.</span>Since in the Seifa she did not say 'if you bring them', the same applies to the Reisha ('Peros of this grocer are forbidden to me')!</p>
<p class="bas indent1"><span class="nm">(i)</span><span class="cl">Answer #2 (to Questions 1 and 2):</span> Indeed, she forbade the Peros, even when she brings them herself;</p>

<p class="bas indent2"><span class="nm">1.</span>The Mishnah is like R. Yosi. Shmuel's law is according to Chachamim.</p>
<p class="bas indent3"><span class="nm">i.</span><span class="cl">(Rav Huna):</span> All Mishnayos in our Perek are like R. Yosi.</p>
<p class="bas indent2"><span class="nm">2.</span>The Mishnah says 'he cannot annul', i.e. due to affliction (for this is not affliction). He can annul because it is a vow between them. (Some say that this is a third answer.)</p>
<p class="bas subject"><span class="nm">2)</span>VOWS THAT INCLUDE AFFLICTION</p>
<p class="bas indent1"><span class="nm">(a)</span><span class="cl">(Rav Yehudah):</span> If a woman vowed not to eat either of two loaves, and she longs to eat one, but she has no desire for the other, since her husband can annul the vow regarding the loaf she wants, he can annul the entire vow.</p>
<p class="bas indent1"><span class="nm">(b)</span><span class="cl">Version #1 (Rav Asi, citing R. Yochanan):</span> He can annul only regarding the one she wants.</p>
<p class="bas indent1"><span class="nm">(c)</span><span class="cl">Version #2 - Question (Rav Asi):</span> In this case, what is the law?</p>
<p class="bas indent1"><span class="nm">(d)</span><span class="cl">Answer (R. Yochanan):</span> He can annul only regarding the one she wants.</p>
