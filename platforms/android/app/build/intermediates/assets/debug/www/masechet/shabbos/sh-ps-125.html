<p class="bas indent1"><span class="nm">(a)</span><span class="cl">(Bar Hameduri):</span> On Shabbos, one may move strands that came off a mattress.</p>
<p class="bas indent1"><span class="nm">(b)</span><span class="cl">Question:</span> What is the reason?</p>
<p class="bas indent1"><span class="nm">(c)</span><span class="cl">Answer (Rava):</span> The mattress itself is made to cover dirt - similarly, the strands are fitting to cover filth!</p>
<p class="bas indent1"><span class="nm">(d)</span><span class="cl">(R. Zeira):</span> One may not move a worn out Talis on Shabbos.</p>
<p class="bas indent1"><span class="nm">(e)</span><span class="cl">(Abaye):</span> He refers to rags less than three by three fingers, since they are not fit for rich or poor people.</p>
<p class="bas indent1"><span class="nm">(f)</span><span class="cl">(Beraisa - R. Meir):</span> Shards of an oven are like regular Kelim, they may be moved in a Chatzer;</p>
<p class="bas indent1"><span class="nm">(g)</span>R. Yehudah says, they may not be moved.</p>
<p class="bas indent1"><span class="nm">(h)</span>R. Yosi testified in the name of R. Eliezer ben Yakov that shards of an oven may be moved on Shabbos, and that the cover of an oven does not need a handle [to be permitted to be moved].</p>
<p class="bas indent1"><span class="nm">(i)</span><span class="cl">Question:</span> What do they argue about?</p>
<p class="bas indent1"><span class="nm">(j)</span><span class="cl">Answer #1 (Abaye):</span> They argue like they argue in our Mishnah, about whether or not we require that the shards perform a use similar to the original Kli - R. Yehudah requires this, R. Meir does not.</p>
<p class="bas indent1"><span class="nm">(k)</span><span class="cl">Objection (Rava):</span> If so, they should discuss fragments of a [any] Kli - why did the Beraisa specify an oven?!</p>
<p class="bas indent1"><span class="nm">(l)</span><span class="cl">Answer #2 (Rava):</span> (A normal oven is a box open on bottom and attached to the ground; it is heated by a fire below.) They argue about shards of the following oven:</p>
<p class="bas indent2"><span class="nm">1.</span><span class="cl">(Mishnah - R. Yehudah):</span> If an oven was placed over the opening of a pit or cistern, and a rock was wedged between it and the wall [to hold it up]:</p>
<p class="bas indent3"><span class="nm">i.</span>If a fire below will heat the oven [enough to bake], it is Tamei; if not, it is Tahor;</p>
<p class="bas indent2"><span class="nm">2.</span>Chachamim say, since there is a way to heat it (from inside itself if it would be put on the ground) it is Tamei.</p>
<p class="bas indent2"><span class="nm">3.</span>They argue about "Tanur v'Chirayim <i>Yutatz</i> Teme'im Hem u'Tme'im Yihyu Lachem":</p>
<p class="bas indent3"><span class="nm">i.</span>R. Yehudah says, it is Tamei only if it requires Nesitzah (demolition) - since this oven need not be razed [to put it elsewhere], it is Tahor;</p>
<p class="bas indent3"><span class="nm">ii.</span>Chachamim expound "U'Tme'im Yihyu Lachem" - in any case.</p>
<p class="bas indent2"><span class="nm">4.</span><span class="cl">Question:</span> How do Chachamim expound "Yutatz"?</p>
<p class="bas indent2"><span class="nm">5.</span><span class="cl">Answer:</span> One might have thought that a proper oven, which is attached to the ground, is [Tahor] like the ground - the verse teaches that this is not so.</p>
<p class="bas indent2"><span class="nm">6.</span><span class="cl">Question:</span> How does R. Yehudah expound "U'Tme'im Yihyu Lachem"?</p>
<p class="bas indent2"><span class="nm">7.</span><span class="cl">Answer:</span> He expounds it like Rav Yehudah:</p>
<p class="bas indent3"><span class="nm">i.</span><span class="cl">(Rav Yehudah):</span> They argue about the first time it is heated - but once it was heated [while attached to the ground] it is Mekabel Tum'ah on any subsequent heating, even if it hangs from a camel's neck.</p>
<p class="bas indent3"><span class="nm">ii.</span><span class="cl">(Ula):</span> Chachamim Metamei the first time it is heated, even if it hangs from a camel's neck.</p>
<p class="bas indent1"><span class="nm">(m)</span><span class="cl">Objection (Rav Ashi):</span> If so, they should argue about an intact [detached] oven - since R. Yehudah does not consider it a Kli (he is Metaher), all the more so regarding shards!</p>
<p class="bas indent1"><span class="nm">(n)</span><span class="cl">Support of Answer #1 (Rav Ashi):</span> Really, they argue about whether or not a use similar to the original Kli is required - the case is, the shards are [heated externally and] used for cooking like tiles; R. Meir addresses R. Yehudah according to R. Yehudah's reasoning:</p>
<p class="bas indent2"><span class="nm">1.</span>I say that any use suffices for it to be Mekabel Tum'ah - granted, you require a use similar to the original Kli - you should agree that this is similar to an oven!</p>
<p class="bas indent2"><span class="nm">2.</span><span class="cl">R. Yehudah:</span> This is different - an oven is heated from its inside, these are heated externally; an oven stands upright [and bread is stuck to its walls], these are not upright (they rest on their width)!</p>
<p class="bas indent1"><span class="nm">(o)</span><span class="cl">(Beraisa):</span> R. Yosi testified in the name of R. Eliezer ben Yakov that shards of an oven may be moved on Shabbos, and that the cover of an oven does not need a handle.</p>
<p class="bas indent1"><span class="nm">(p)</span><span class="cl">Question (Ravina):</span> We move covers of ovens of Masa Machsiya, which do not have handles - like which Tana is this?</p>
<p class="bas indent1"><span class="nm">(q)</span><span class="cl">Answer:</span> It is like R. Eliezer ben Yakov.</p>
<p class="bas subject"><span class="nm">2)</span>PREPARATION OF AN OBJECT FOR USE ON SHABBOS</p>
<p class="bas indent1"><span class="nm">(a)</span><span class="cl">(Mishnah):</span> If a rock in a dry hollow pumpkin (used to weigh it down, in order to draw water from a well) does not fall out, we may use it to draw water; if not, not;</p>
<p class="bas bbbline">125b----------------------------------------125b</p>
<p class="bas indent1"><span class="nm">(b)</span>If a vine branch is tied to a flask used to draw water, one may draw with it on Shabbos.</p>
<p class="bas indent1"><span class="nm">(c)</span>('Window' refers to a hole in the wall.) R. Eliezer says, if a window stopper (a board or curtain used to cover the opening) is tied [to the wall] and hangs (does not drag on the ground), one may use it to close a window; if not, not;</p>
<p class="bas indent1"><span class="nm">(d)</span>Chachamim say, in either case one may use it to close.</p>
<p class="bas indent1"><span class="nm">(e)</span><span class="cl">(Gemara - Mishnah):</span> If a rock is on top of a barrel, one tilts the barrel and the rock falls.</p>
<p class="bas indent1"><span class="nm">(f)</span><span class="cl">(Rabah citing R. Ami citing R. Yochanan):</span> This is only if he forgot it - if he intentionally left it on, the barrel is a Bosis for Isur.</p>
<p class="bas indent1"><span class="nm">(g)</span><span class="cl">(Rav Yosef citing R. Asi citing R. Yochanan):</span> This is only if he forgot it - if he intentionally left it on, the rock is a cover (it may be moved normally).</p>
<p class="bas indent1"><span class="nm">(h)</span><span class="cl">Question (Rabah, against himself - Mishnah):</span> If a rock in a dry hollow pumpkin does not fall out, we may use it to draw water.</p>
<p class="bas indent1"><span class="nm">(i)</span><span class="cl">Answer (Rabah):</span> There, since it fits tightly, it is like a wall of the pumpkin.</p>
<p class="bas indent1"><span class="nm">(j)</span><span class="cl">Question (Rav Yosef, against himself - Mishnah):</span> If the rock falls out, we may not use it to draw.</p>
<p class="bas indent1"><span class="nm">(k)</span><span class="cl">Answer (Rav Yosef):</span> There, since he did not make it fit tightly, he shows that he was Mevatel it (he does not consider it to be a wall).</p>
<p class="bas indent1"><span class="nm">(l)</span><span class="cl">Question:</span> What do they argue about?</p>
<p class="bas indent1"><span class="nm">(m)</span><span class="cl">Answer:</span> Rabah requires an action to be done [to make it a Kli], Rav Yosef does not require an action</p>
<p class="bas indent1"><span class="nm">(n)</span>This is like R. Ami and R. Asi taught elsewhere:</p>
<p class="bas indent2"><span class="nm">1.</span><span class="cl">(R. Chanina):</span> A case occurred, Rebbi came upon a row of rocks and told his Talmidim to have intent to sit on them tomorrow [Shabbos] - he did not require an action;</p>
<p class="bas indent2"><span class="nm">2.</span><span class="cl">(R. Yochanan):</span> He required an action.</p>
<p class="bas indent2"><span class="nm">3.</span><span class="cl">Question:</span> What did he do?</p>
<p class="bas indent2"><span class="nm">4.</span><span class="cl">Answer #1 (R. Ami):</span> He told them to arrange them (because they may not move them on Shabbos);</p>
<p class="bas indent2"><span class="nm">5.</span><span class="cl">Answer #2 (R. Asi):</span> He told them to clean the mud off them (this permits to move them on Shabbos).</p>
<p class="bas indent2"><span class="nm">6.</span><span class="cl">(R. Yosi ben Sha'ul):</span> It was a row of beams (not rocks);</p>
<p class="bas indent2"><span class="nm">7.</span><span class="cl">(R. Yochanan ben Sha'ul):</span> It was a pole used by ships [to feel if the water is too shallow].</p>
<p class="bas indent1"><span class="nm">(o)</span>The opinion that it was a ship pole agrees that this would suffice for beams - but the opinion that it was beams would not permit a ship pole so easily, since people are adamant that it not get ruined [they fix a place for it].</p>
<p class="bas indent1"><span class="nm">(p)</span><span class="cl">(Mishnah):</span> If a vine branch is tied...</p>
<p class="bas indent1"><span class="nm">(q)</span><span class="cl">Inference:</span> If it is not tied, one may not draw with it on Shabbos.</p>
<p class="bas indent1"><span class="nm">(r)</span><span class="cl">Suggestion:</span> Our Mishnah is unlike R. Shimon ben Gamliel:</p>
<p class="bas indent2"><span class="nm">1.</span><span class="cl">(Beraisa):</span> If one cut Chariyos (hard, leafless Lulav branches) for the sake of [fire] wood, and then decided to use them to sit on, he must tie them;</p>
<p class="bas indent2"><span class="nm">2.</span>R. Shimon ben Gamliel says, he need not tie them.</p>
<p class="bas indent1"><span class="nm">(s)</span><span class="cl">Answer #1 (Rav Sheshes):</span> It is even like R. Shimon ben Gamliel - the case is the vine branches are connected to the vine.</p>
<p class="bas indent2"><span class="nm">1.</span><span class="cl">Question:</span> It is forbidden to use something attached to the ground!</p>
<p class="bas indent2"><span class="nm">2.</span><span class="cl">Answer:</span> He uses them within three Tefachim of the ground (this is permitted).</p>
<p class="bas indent1"><span class="nm">(t)</span><span class="cl">Answer #2 (Rav Ashi):</span> The vine branches are detached - if they are not tied, it is forbidden lest one cut them to size.</p>
<p class="bas subject"><span class="nm">3)</span>ADDING TO AN <i>OHEL</i> ON SHABBOS</p>
<p class="bas indent1"><span class="nm">(a)</span><span class="cl">(Mishnah):</span> If a window stopper...</p>
<p class="bas indent1"><span class="nm">(b)</span><span class="cl">(Rabah bar bar Chanah):</span> All agree that one may not make a new temporary Ohel (roof) on Yom Tov, there is no need to say it is forbidden on Shabbos - they argue about adding to an Ohel:</p>
<p class="bas indent2"><span class="nm">1.</span>R. Eliezer forbids adding on Yom Tov, there is no need to say that he forbids on Shabbos;</p>
<p class="bas indent2"><span class="nm">2.</span>Chachamim permit adding on Shabbos, there is no need to say that they permit on Yom Tov.</p>
