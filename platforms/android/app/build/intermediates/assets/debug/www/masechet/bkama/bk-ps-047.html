<p class="bas subject"><span class="nm">1)</span>A <i>SAFEK</i> ABOUT WHETHER THE FETUS HELPED DAMAGE (cont.)</p>
<p class="bas indent1"><span class="nm">(a)</span><span class="cl">(Inference):</span> This is because we do not know if the calf was born before or after the goring. Had we known it was born after (and was a partner in the damage), the entire half-damage could be collected from it!</p>
<p class="bas indent1"><span class="nm">(b)</span>This is like Rava taught, that if a pregnant cow damaged, one may collect from the calf.</p>
<p class="bas indent1"><span class="nm">(c)</span><span class="cl">Question:</span> What is the reason?</p>
<p class="bas indent1"><span class="nm">(d)</span><span class="cl">Answer:</span> It was part of the cow.</p>
<p class="bas indent1"><span class="nm">(e)</span>If a chicken damaged, we do not collect from the eggs.</p>
<p class="bas indent1"><span class="nm">(f)</span><span class="cl">Question:</span> What is the reason?</p>
<p class="bas indent1"><span class="nm">(g)</span><span class="cl">Answer:</span> It is like something separate from the chicken.</p>
<p class="bas subject"><span class="nm">2)</span>HOW MUCH DOES ONE PAY IF HIS OX CAUSED A COW TO MISCARRY?</p>
<p class="bas indent1"><span class="nm">(a)</span><span class="cl">(Rava):</span> (In the Reisha, a dead calf was found near a gored cow.) We do not evaluate the cow by itself and the calf by itself. Rather, we evaluate how much the calf increased the value of the mother.</p>
<p class="bas indent2"><span class="nm">1.</span>To evaluate it by itself would make the damager pay too much.</p>
<p class="bas indent1"><span class="nm">(b)</span>Similarly, if Reuven cut off the hand of Shimon's slave (we do not estimate how much Shimon would demand to allow this, rather, we evaluate the loss in value of the slave) or damaged his field (we do not estimate the damaged area by itself, rather, we evaluate how much it decreased the value of a sizable portion of the field).</p>
<p class="bas indent1"><span class="nm">(c)</span><span class="cl">Question (R. Acha brei d'Rava):</span> Why is this considered 'too much', if this is what the damager should pay?</p>
<p class="bas indent1"><span class="nm">(d)</span><span class="cl">Answer (Rav Ashi):</span> The damage was done to a pregnant cow, so that is what we evaluate.</p>
<p class="bas indent1"><span class="nm">(e)</span>Obviously, if Reuven owns the cow and Levi owns the calf, Reuven gets the compensation for the increased fat.</p>
<p class="bas indent1"><span class="nm">(f)</span><span class="cl">Question:</span> Who gets paid for the increased value due to the larger volume (it looks fatter and healthier)?</p>
<p class="bas indent1"><span class="nm">(g)</span><span class="cl">Answer #1 (Rav Papa):</span> Reuven gets it.</p>
<p class="bas indent1"><span class="nm">(h)</span><span class="cl">Answer #2 (R. Acha brei d'Rav Ika):</span> They share it.</p>
<p class="bas indent2"><span class="nm">1.</span>The Halachah is, they share it.</p>
<p class="bas subject"><span class="nm">3)</span>BRINGING PROPERTY INTO ANOTHER'S DOMAIN</p>
<p class="bas indent1"><span class="nm">(a)</span><span class="cl">(Mishnah):</span> If Shimon brought his pots or fruit into Reuven's yard without permission, and Reuven's animals broke or ate them, he is exempt;</p>
<p class="bas indent2"><span class="nm">1.</span>If Reuven's animals were damaged by the pots or fruit, Shimon is liable.</p>
<p class="bas indent2"><span class="nm">2.</span>If Shimon had permission to bring them in, Reuven is liable.</p>
<p class="bas bbbline">47b----------------------------------------47b</p>
<p class="bas indent1"><span class="nm">(b)</span>If Shimon brought his ox into Reuven's yard without permission, and Reuven's animals damaged it, he is exempt;</p>
<p class="bas indent2"><span class="nm">1.</span>If the ox damaged Reuven's animals, or fell into a pit and dirtied the water, Shimon is liable;</p>
<p class="bas indent2"><span class="nm">2.</span>If Reuven's father or son was inside the pit, Shimon pays Kofer;</p>
<p class="bas indent2"><span class="nm">3.</span>If Shimon had permission to bring his ox in, Reuven is liable.</p>
<p class="bas indent1"><span class="nm">(c)</span>Rebbi says, in all cases one is liable only if he accepted responsibility for the other's property.</p>
<p class="bas indent1"><span class="nm">(d)</span><span class="cl">(Gemara) Inference:</span> Shimon is liable because he had no permission. Had he had permission, he would be exempt when Reuven's animals were damaged;</p>
<p class="bas indent2"><span class="nm">1.</span>We do not say that Shimon accepted to guard Reuven's animals. This is like Rebbi, who says that Stam (without specifying), one does not accept responsibility for another's animals.</p>
<p class="bas indent1"><span class="nm">(e)</span><span class="cl">Question (next clause of Mishnah):</span> If Shimon had permission to bring his pots in, Reuven is liable.</p>
<p class="bas indent2"><span class="nm">1.</span>This is like Chachamim, who say that Stam one accepts responsibility to guard himself from damaging another's property!</p>
<p class="bas indent2"><span class="nm">2.</span>The Mishnah concludes with Rebbi's opinion. Can the Reisha and Seifa be like Rebbi, and the middle is like Chachamim?!</p>
<p class="bas indent1"><span class="nm">(f)</span><span class="cl">Answer #1 (R. Zeira):</span> Different Tana'im taught the Mishnah. (The Tana of the middle clause holds that Chachamim argue with Rebbi. The Tana of the Reisha and Seifa holds that Chachamim agree with Rebbi.)</p>
<p class="bas indent1"><span class="nm">(g)</span><span class="cl">Answer #2 (Rava):</span> The entire Mishnah (until it mentions Rebbi) is like Chachamim. When Reuven gives permission, he accepts to guard Shimon's property even from falling in the wind!</p>
<p class="bas subject"><span class="nm">4)</span>AN ANIMAL THAT WAS DAMAGED BY EATING</p>
<p class="bas indent1"><span class="nm">(a)</span><span class="cl">(Mishnah):</span> If Shimon brought his fruit into Reuven's yard...</p>
<p class="bas indent1"><span class="nm">(b)</span><span class="cl">(Rav):</span> Shimon is liable only for damage to Reuven's animals if they slipped on the fruit. If they got sick from eating the fruit, Shimon is exempt.</p>
<p class="bas indent1"><span class="nm">(c)</span><span class="cl">Question:</span> What is the reason?</p>
<p class="bas indent1"><span class="nm">(d)</span><span class="cl">Answer:</span> The animals should not have eaten them.</p>
<p class="bas indent1"><span class="nm">(e)</span><span class="cl">Question (Rav Sheshes - Beraisa):</span> If Levi put poison in front of Yehudah's animal, he is exempt b'Yedei Adam (Beis Din cannot make him pay), but liable b'Yedei Shamayim (Hash-m holds him accountable).</p>
<p class="bas indent2"><span class="nm">1.</span><span class="cl">Inference:</span> This refers only to poison, which animals do not normally eat. If they ate fruit, which is normal, even Beis Din forces him to pay!</p>
<p class="bas indent2"><span class="nm">2.</span>According to Rav, he should be exempt, for the animal should not have eaten!</p>
<p class="bas indent1"><span class="nm">(f)</span><span class="cl">Answer #1:</span> Even regarding fruit, Beis Din cannot make him pay;</p>
<p class="bas indent2"><span class="nm">1.</span>The Beraisa discusses poison to teach that even though animals normally don't eat it, he is liable b'Yedei Shamayim.</p>
<p class="bas indent1"><span class="nm">(g)</span><span class="cl">Answer #2:</span> The Beraisa discusses a poisonous fruit. (Even though it is normal for animals to eat it, Beis Din does not make him pay.)</p>
<p class="bas indent1"><span class="nm">(h)</span><span class="cl">Question (Beraisa):</span> If a woman, without permission, brought wheat into Reuven's premises to grind it and Reuven's animal ate it, he is exempt.</p>
<p class="bas indent2"><span class="nm">1.</span>If Reuven's animal was damaged, she is liable.</p>
<p class="bas indent2"><span class="nm">2.</span>According to Rav, we should say that Reuven's animal should not have eaten!</p>
<p class="bas indent1"><span class="nm">(i)</span><span class="cl">Answer:</span> Just like Rav explains that the Mishnah is when the animal slipped on the fruit, also the Beraisa!</p>
<p class="bas indent1"><span class="nm">(j)</span><span class="cl">Question:</span> This is obvious! The one who asked, what did he think?</p>
<p class="bas indent1"><span class="nm">(k)</span><span class="cl">Answer:</span> The Mishnah says 'Reuven's animal was damaged ba'Hen (through them)', which can mean that it slipped on them;</p>
<p class="bas indent2"><span class="nm">1.</span>The Beraisa says only 'Reuven's animal was damaged', which connotes that it ate them!</p>
<p class="bas indent2"><span class="nm">2.</span>Rav holds that both can be explained to mean that it slipped on them.</p>
<p class="bas indent1"><span class="nm">(l)</span><span class="cl">Question (Beraisa):</span> If Shimon brought his ox into Reuven's yard without permission, and it ate wheat, fell sick and died, Reuven is exempt;</p>
<p class="bas indent2"><span class="nm">1.</span>If Shimon had permission to bring his ox in, Reuven is liable.</p>
<p class="bas indent2"><span class="nm">2.</span>According to Rav, we should say that Shimon's animal should not have eaten!</p>
<p class="bas indent1"><span class="nm">(m)</span><span class="cl">Answer (Rava):</span> You cannot compare when there was permission to when there was not!</p>
<p class="bas indent2"><span class="nm">1.</span>One who gives permission accepts responsibility, even if the animal chokes itself!</p>
<p class="bas subject"><span class="nm">5)</span>DAMAGE IN THE PREMISES OF A THIRD PARTY</p>
<p class="bas indent1"><span class="nm">(a)</span><span class="cl">Question:</span> When one accepts responsibility, does he accept only that his own property will not damage it, or even that others' property will not damage it?</p>
<p class="bas indent1"><span class="nm">(b)</span><span class="cl">Answer #1:</span> Rav Yehudah bar Simon taught that if Shimon brought his fruit into Reuven's yard without permission and Levi's ox ate them, he is exempt;</p>
<p class="bas indent2"><span class="nm">1.</span>If Shimon had permission to bring them in, he is liable.</p>
<p class="bas indent2"><span class="nm">2.</span><span class="cl">Question:</span> Who is exempt or liable?</p>
<p class="bas indent3"><span class="nm">i.</span><span class="cl">Suggestion:</span> Reuven is. (This shows that one accepts responsibility even that others' property will not damage it.)</p>
<p class="bas indent1"><span class="nm">(c)</span><span class="cl">Rejection:</span> No, Levi is.</p>
