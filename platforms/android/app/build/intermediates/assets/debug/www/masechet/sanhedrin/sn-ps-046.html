<p class="bas subject"><span class="nm">1)</span>WHO IS HANGED? (cont.)</p>
<p class="bas indent1"><span class="nm">(a)</span><span class="cl">Question:</span> What do they argue about?</p>
<p class="bas indent1"><span class="nm">(b)</span><span class="cl">Answer:</span> Chachamim expound according to Kelal u'Ferat (generalities and specifics), and R. Eliezer expounds Ribuy and Mi'ut (inclusions and exclusions):</p>
<p class="bas indent2"><span class="nm">1.</span>Chachamim expound that "v'Humas v'Salisa" is a Klal, and "Ki Kilelas Elokim Taluy" is a Prat;</p>
<p class="bas indent2"><span class="nm">2.</span>If they would be adjacent to each other, we would include only the Prat;</p>
<p class="bas indent3"><span class="nm">i.</span>Since they are far apart, this comes to include idolatry, which resembles it in all respects.</p>
<p class="bas indent2"><span class="nm">3.</span>R. Eliezer expounds Ribuy and Mi'ut. "V'Humas v'Salisa" is a Ribuy. "Ki Kilelas Elokim Taluy" is a Mi'ut;</p>
<p class="bas indent2"><span class="nm">4.</span>If they would be adjacent to each other, we would include only idolatry, which resembles it in all respects;</p>
<p class="bas indent3"><span class="nm">i.</span>Since they are far apart, this comes to include everyone who is stoned.</p>
<p class="bas indent1"><span class="nm">(c)</span><span class="cl">(Mishnah):</span> We hang a man...</p>
<p class="bas indent1"><span class="nm">(d)</span><span class="cl">Question:</span> What is Chachamim's reason?</p>
<p class="bas indent1"><span class="nm">(e)</span><span class="cl">Answer #1:</span> "V'Salisa Oso" - not her.</p>
<p class="bas indent1"><span class="nm">(f)</span><span class="cl">Objection:</span> R. Eliezer expounds "Oso" - without his garment. Also Chachamim should expound like this!</p>
<p class="bas indent1"><span class="nm">(g)</span><span class="cl">Answer #2:</span> Indeed, they do. Rather, they learn from "v'Chi Yihyeh b'Ish Chet", but not in a woman.</p>
<p class="bas indent1"><span class="nm">(h)</span><span class="cl">Question:</span> How does R. Eliezer expound this?</p>
<p class="bas indent1"><span class="nm">(i)</span><span class="cl">Answer #1 (Reish Lakish):</span> This excludes a Ben Sorer u'Moreh (he is a not a proper Ish (i.e. adult), so he is not hung).</p>
<p class="bas indent1"><span class="nm">(j)</span><span class="cl">Rejection (Beraisa - R. Eliezer):</span> A Ben Sorer u'Moreh is stoned and hung.</p>
<p class="bas indent1"><span class="nm">(k)</span><span class="cl">Answer #2 (Rav Nachman bar Yitzchak):</span> R. Eliezer uses it to include a Ben Sorer u'Moreh.</p>
<p class="bas indent1"><span class="nm">(l)</span><span class="cl">Question:</span> How does he learn this?</p>
<p class="bas indent1"><span class="nm">(m)</span><span class="cl">Answer:</span> "V'Chi Yihyeh b'Ish Chet" refers to a proper man, but not a Ben. Also "Chet" excludes a Ben Sorer u'Moreh. He is not killed for his sin, rather, due to his future (if he would live, he would sin much more);</p>
<p class="bas indent2"><span class="nm">1.</span>Two exclusions, one after the other, always come to include.</p>
<p class="bas subject"><span class="nm">2)</span>MAY WE JUDGE DIFFERENT CAPITAL CASES IN ONE DAY?</p>
<p class="bas indent1"><span class="nm">(a)</span><span class="cl">(Mishnah - R. Eliezer):</span> Shimon ben Shetach hung women in Ashkelon!</p>
<p class="bas indent1"><span class="nm">(b)</span><span class="cl">(Rav Chisda):</span> Beis Din may not judge capital cases of different death penalties (on one day), but it may judge many similar cases.</p>
<p class="bas indent1"><span class="nm">(c)</span><span class="cl">Objection:</span> In the episode with Shimon ben Shetach, they all received the same Misah, yet Chachamim proved that it was a special action not according to Halachah from the law that we do not judge two capital cases in one day!</p>
<p class="bas indent1"><span class="nm">(d)</span><span class="cl">Correction (Rav Chisda):</span> Beis Din may not judge two cases which are <i>like</i> different death penalties...</p>
<p class="bas indent2"><span class="nm">1.</span><span class="cl">Interjection:</span> What does this mean?</p>
<p class="bas indent2"><span class="nm">2.</span><span class="cl">Answer:</span> It means different transgressions.</p>
<p class="bas indent1"><span class="nm">(e)</span><span class="cl">(Rav Chisda - continuation):</span> ...but it may judge multiple cases of the same transgression and the same Misah.</p>
<p class="bas indent1"><span class="nm">(f)</span><span class="cl">Question (Rav Ada bar Ahavah - Beraisa):</span> Beis Din may not judge two capital cases in one day, even an adulterer and adulteress.</p>
<p class="bas indent1"><span class="nm">(g)</span><span class="cl">Answer (Rav Chisda):</span> That refers to a Bas Kohen and her adulterer (or Zomemei Zomemeha. I.e. if lying witnesses testified 'the witnesses who convicted her were with us elsewhere at the time', and they were Huzmu). She is burned and he (or they) are choked. Different Misos cannot be judged the same day.)</p>
<p class="bas indent1"><span class="nm">(h)</span><span class="cl">(Beraisa - R. Eliezer ben Yakov):</span> I heard that Beis Din can lash or punish not according to Torah law;</p>
<p class="bas indent2"><span class="nm">1.</span>They do not intend to transgress Torah law, rather, to make a fence (to deter transgressors).</p>
<p class="bas indent2"><span class="nm">2.</span>A case occurred in the days of the Yevanim, in which a man rode on a horse on Shabbos. Beis Din killed him.</p>
<p class="bas indent3"><span class="nm">i.</span>He did not deserve to be killed, but at the time it was necessary to kill him (people were disgracing the Mitzvos).</p>
<p class="bas indent2"><span class="nm">3.</span>Another case occurred in which a man had Bi'ah with his wife under a fig tree. Beis Din killed gave him lashes.</p>
<p class="bas indent3"><span class="nm">i.</span>He did not deserve to be given lashes, but at the time it was necessary.</p>
<p class="bas subject"><span class="nm">3)</span>HOW WE HANG PEOPLE</p>
<p class="bas indent1"><span class="nm">(a)</span><span class="cl">(Mishnah):</span> To hang someone, we insert a beam into the ground, partly sticking out. We bring his hands together, and hang him by them;</p>
<p class="bas indent1"><span class="nm">(b)</span>R. Yosi says, we lean the beam against a wall and hang him from it, the way butchers hang meat.</p>
<p class="bas indent1"><span class="nm">(c)</span>Immediately, we take him down. If not, we transgress "Lo Salin."</p>
<p class="bas indent2"><span class="nm">1.</span>Since he is hung for blasphemy, everyone who sees him is reminded of his act - this is Chilul Hash-m.</p>
<p class="bas indent1"><span class="nm">(d)</span>R. Meir says, when one is in pain, the Shechinah (Divine Presence) says 'My head hurts. My arms hurt.' (Kilelas is like Kal Leis, I (Hash-m) am not feeling well);</p>
<p class="bas indent2"><span class="nm">1.</span>The Shechinah feels pain over the blood (pain) of Resha'im, and all the more so over the blood of Tzadikim!</p>
<p class="bas indent1"><span class="nm">(e)</span>Also, anyone who leaves his dead relative overnight (unburied) transgresses a Lav;</p>
<p class="bas indent2"><span class="nm">1.</span>If he left him for his honor, to bring a coffin or shrouds, he does not transgress.</p>
<p class="bas indent1"><span class="nm">(f)</span>Someone executed is not buried with his family;</p>
<p class="bas indent2"><span class="nm">1.</span>Beis Din has two cemeteries, one for those killed by the sword or choked, and one for those stoned or burned.</p>
<p class="bas indent2"><span class="nm">2.</span>After the flesh has decomposed (the deceased received atonement), his bones are buried with his family.</p>
<p class="bas indent1"><span class="nm">(g)</span>After one is executed, his relatives greet the judges and witnesses, to shows that they do not bear a grudge. They believe that the sentence was correct.</p>
<p class="bas bbbline">46b----------------------------------------46b</p>
<p class="bas indent1"><span class="nm">(h)</span>The relatives do not mourn (Aveilus)., they conduct Aninus, for this is not apparent to others.</p>
<p class="bas indent1"><span class="nm">(i)</span><span class="cl">(Gemara - Beraisa):</span> Had it said 'Chet v'Salisa', one would have thought that we hang before killing, like kings do;</p>
<p class="bas indent2"><span class="nm">1.</span>It says "v'Humas v'Salisa" to teach that we kill before hanging.</p>
<p class="bas indent2"><span class="nm">2.</span>We delay the verdict until shortly before sundown. we kill him and hang him (this way, we must bury him immediately, we are not concerned lest people will tarry and come to forget).</p>
<p class="bas indent2"><span class="nm">3.</span>One person ties him to the beam and (immediately) one unties him, to fulfill the Mitzvah of hanging.</p>
<p class="bas indent1"><span class="nm">(j)</span><span class="cl">(Beraisa) Suggestion:</span> Perhaps the "Etz" (beam) can be attached or detached!</p>
<p class="bas indent1"><span class="nm">(k)</span><span class="cl">Rejection:</span> "Ki Kavor" - we must be able to bury the body right away;</p>
<p class="bas indent2"><span class="nm">1.</span>This excludes an attached tree, for it must be cut before it can be buried.</p>
<p class="bas indent2"><span class="nm">2.</span>R. Yosi says, it also excludes a beam inserted in the ground, for it must be unearthed before it can be buried.</p>
<p class="bas indent2"><span class="nm">3.</span>Chachamim say, unearthing it is insignificant. An inserted beam is considered ready for immediate burial.</p>
<p class="bas indent1"><span class="nm">(l)</span><span class="cl">(Mishnah):</span> Since he is hung for blasphemy...</p>
<p class="bas indent1"><span class="nm">(m)</span><span class="cl">(Beraisa - R. Meir):</span> A parable explains this. There were twin brothers. One was appointed king, and the other was a bandit. The king ordered to hang him. Passersby thought that the king was hanging, so the king ordered to take him down. (Man was created in Hash-m's image.)</p>
<p class="bas indent1"><span class="nm">(n)</span><span class="cl">(Mishnah - R. Meir):</span> (When one is in pain,the Shechinah says 'My head hurts...')</p>
<p class="bas indent1"><span class="nm">(o)</span><span class="cl">Question:</span> What is R. Meir's source for this?</p>
<p class="bas indent1"><span class="nm">(p)</span><span class="cl">Answer #1 (Abaye):</span> He expounds "Kilelas" like Kal Leis (Hash-m's 'limbs' are not light).</p>
<p class="bas indent1"><span class="nm">(q)</span><span class="cl">Objection (Rava):</span> If so, the Mishnah should have said 'My head is <i>heavy</i> upon me...'!</p>
<p class="bas indent1"><span class="nm">(r)</span><span class="cl">Answer #2 (Rava):</span> Hash-m says that the world is light to Me (an indirect way of saying that He 'feels heavy').</p>
<p class="bas indent1"><span class="nm">(s)</span><span class="cl">Question:</span> The verse teaches that a blasphemer is hung (it is not free to be expounded)!</p>
<p class="bas indent1"><span class="nm">(t)</span><span class="cl">Answer:</span> If so, it should have said 'Mekalel.' (Since it says "Kilelas", we also expound like Rava).</p>
<p class="bas indent2"><span class="nm">1.</span><span class="cl">Question:</span> Perhaps it only comes to teach like Rava!</p>
<p class="bas indent2"><span class="nm">2.</span><span class="cl">Answer:</span> If so, it should have said 'Kalas.' (Since it says "Kilelas", it also teaches about a blasphemer).</p>
<p class="bas subject"><span class="nm">4)</span>THE MITZVAH OF BURYING THE DEAD</p>
<p class="bas indent1"><span class="nm">(a)</span><span class="cl">(Mishnah):</span> Also, anyone who leaves his deceased overnight transgresses a Lav.</p>
<p class="bas indent1"><span class="nm">(b)</span><span class="cl">Version #1 (R. Yochanan):</span> Anyone who leaves his deceased overnight transgresses a Lav. (A Lav forbids leaving someone hung by Beis Din overnight, and after this it says "Ki Kavor Tikberenu." (The double expression comes to include any Mes).</p>
<p class="bas indent1"><span class="nm">(c)</span><span class="cl">Version #2 (R. Yochanan):</span> "Ki Kavor Tikberenu" hints at the Mitzvah of burying the dead.</p>
<p class="bas indent1"><span class="nm">(d)</span><span class="cl">Question (Shevor Malka):</span> What is the source for the Mitzvah of burying the dead?</p>
<p class="bas indent1"><span class="nm">(e)</span>Rav Chama was silent.</p>
<p class="bas indent1"><span class="nm">(f)</span><span class="cl">Question (Rav Acha bar Yakov):</span> He should have said "Ki Kavor"!</p>
<p class="bas indent1"><span class="nm">(g)</span><span class="cl">Answer:</span> Rav Chama expounds that to teach that we put a Mes in a coffin (it does not teach that we bury in the ground).</p>
<p class="bas indent1"><span class="nm">(h)</span><span class="cl">Question Rav Acha bar Yakov:</span> He should have said "Tikberenu"!</p>
<p class="bas indent1"><span class="nm">(i)</span><span class="cl">Answer:</span> Rav Chama does not (Ran; Rashi - Shvor Malka would not) hold that the double expression warrants this Drashah.</p>
<p class="bas indent1"><span class="nm">(j)</span><span class="cl">Question:</span> He should have said, since we find that great Tzadikim were buried, surely it is a Mitzvah!</p>
<p class="bas indent1"><span class="nm">(k)</span><span class="cl">Answer:</span> Perhaps it is only a custom.</p>
<p class="bas indent1"><span class="nm">(l)</span><span class="cl">Question:</span> Hash-m buried Moshe. Surely it is a Mitzvah!</p>
<p class="bas indent1"><span class="nm">(m)</span><span class="cl">Answer:</span> Perhaps He did not want to deviate from the custom.</p>
<p class="bas indent1"><span class="nm">(n)</span><span class="cl">Question:</span> "V'Sofdu... (v'Kovru Oso.)" (This was a reward to Aviyah!)</p>
<p class="bas indent1"><span class="nm">(o)</span><span class="cl">Answer:</span> His reward was that he would not be different. (However, it is only a custom, and not a Mitzvah.)</p>
<p class="bas indent1"><span class="nm">(p)</span><span class="cl">Question:</span> "Lo Yisofdu v'Lo Yikaveru" - if it is a punishment that Resha'im are not buried, surely Hash-m approves of burial!</p>
<p class="bas indent1"><span class="nm">(q)</span><span class="cl">Answer:</span> It is a punishment not to conduct with them according to custom.</p>
<p class="bas subject"><span class="nm">5)</span>THE REASON FOR BURIAL AND EULOGIES</p>
<p class="bas indent1"><span class="nm">(a)</span><span class="cl">Question:</span> What is the reason for burial? Is it to avoid disgrace (of a rotting corpse), or for atonement?</p>
<p class="bas indent2"><span class="nm">1.</span><span class="cl">Question:</span> What difference does it make?</p>
<p class="bas indent2"><span class="nm">2.</span><span class="cl">Answer:</span> If he asked (before he died) not to be buried: if we are concerned for disgrace, we do not comply; if it is for atonement, since he does not want it, we honor his request.</p>
<p class="bas indent1"><span class="nm">(b)</span><span class="cl">Answer #1:</span> Tzadikim are buried, even though they do not need atonement!</p>
<p class="bas indent1"><span class="nm">(c)</span><span class="cl">Rejection:</span> They do - "Adam Ein Tzadik ba'Aretz... v'Lo Yecheta."</p>
<p class="bas indent1"><span class="nm">(d)</span><span class="cl">Answer #2:</span> "V'Sofdu (Aviyah)... v'Kovru Oso."</p>
<p class="bas indent2"><span class="nm">1.</span>If it is for atonement, all of Yarav'am's family should have been buried!</p>
<p class="bas indent1"><span class="nm">(e)</span><span class="cl">Rejection:</span> Hash-m did not want them to get atonement, for they were Resha'im.</p>
<p class="bas indent1"><span class="nm">(f)</span><span class="cl">Answer #3:</span> "(The people of Anasos) Lo Yisofdu v'Lo Yikaveru."</p>
<p class="bas indent1"><span class="nm">(g)</span><span class="cl">Rejection:</span> Hash-m did not want them to get atonement.</p>
<p class="bas indent1"><span class="nm">(h)</span><span class="cl">Question:</span> Is a eulogy to honor the dead or the living?</p>
<p class="bas indent2"><span class="nm">1.</span><span class="cl">Question:</span> What difference does it make?</p>
<p class="bas indent2"><span class="nm">2.</span><span class="cl">Answer #1:</span> He asked not to be eulogized. (If it is for his honor, we comply.)</p>
<p class="bas indent2"><span class="nm">3.</span><span class="cl">Answer #2:</span> If it is for his honor, we force the heirs to pay for eulogizers.</p>
<p class="bas indent1"><span class="nm">(i)</span>Answer #1 "Va'Yavo Avraham Lispod l'Sarah v'Livkosah." If it were to honor the living, they would not have delayed her burial until Avraham returned (from the Akeidah)!</p>
<p class="bas indent1"><span class="nm">(j)</span><span class="cl">Rejection:</span> Sarah herself would have wanted this, in order to honor Avraham.</p>
<p class="bas indent1"><span class="nm">(k)</span><span class="cl">Answer #2:</span> "V'Sofdu Lo Chol Yisrael." Aviyah's relatives were Resha'im, and they were not worthy of being honored. (Surely, it must be to honor the dead.)</p>
<p class="bas indent1"><span class="nm">(l)</span><span class="cl">Rejection:</span> Tzadikim want that others be honored through them.</p>
<p class="bas indent1"><span class="nm">(m)</span>Answer #3 "Lo Yisofdu v'Lo Yikaveru" (if it is to honor the living, they should be eulogized)!</p>
<p class="bas indent1"><span class="nm">(n)</span><span class="cl">Rejection:</span> Tzadikim do not want to be honored through Resha'im.</p>
<p class="bas indent1"><span class="nm">(o)</span><span class="cl">Answer #4:</span> "(Yirmeyahu told Tzidkiyahu) "V'Hoy Adon Yispedu Lach." If it is to honor the living, what difference does it make to him?</p>
<p class="bas indent1"><span class="nm">(p)</span><span class="cl">Rejection:</span> He told him 'Yisrael will get honor through you, like they did from your ancestors.'</p>
