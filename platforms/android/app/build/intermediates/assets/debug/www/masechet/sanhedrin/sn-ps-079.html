<p class="bas subject"><span class="nm">1)</span>ONE WHO DID NOT STRIKE WHAT HE AIMED FOR</p>
<p class="bas indent1"><span class="nm">(a)</span><span class="cl">(Mishnah):</span> In the following cases, one is exempt:</p>
<p class="bas indent2"><span class="nm">1.</span>He intended to kill an animal, Nochri, or Nefel (stillborn baby) (and he accidentally killed a healthy Yisrael);</p>
<p class="bas indent2"><span class="nm">2.</span>He intended to hit him on his leg, and such a blow on the leg would not have killed him, but he hit him on the heart and it was enough to kill him there;</p>
<p class="bas indent2"><span class="nm">3.</span>He intended to hit him on his heart, and such a blow on the heart would have killed him, but he hit him on the leg and it was not enough to kill him there (but he died anyway);</p>
<p class="bas indent2"><span class="nm">4.</span>He intended to hit an adult, and such a blow would not kill an adult, but he hit a minor and it was enough to kill a minor;</p>
<p class="bas indent2"><span class="nm">5.</span>He intended to hit a minor, and such a blow would kill a minor, but he hit an adult and it was not enough to kill an adult (but he died anyway).</p>
<p class="bas indent1"><span class="nm">(b)</span>In the following cases, one is liable:</p>
<p class="bas indent2"><span class="nm">1.</span>He intended to hit him on his leg, and such a blow on the leg would kill, but he hit him on the heart and it was enough to kill him;</p>
<p class="bas indent2"><span class="nm">2.</span>He intended to hit an adult, and such a blow would kill an adult, but he hit a minor and it was enough to kill a minor.</p>
<p class="bas indent1"><span class="nm">(c)</span>R. Shimon says, even if he intended to kill Reuven and killed Shimon, he is exempt.</p>
<p class="bas indent1"><span class="nm">(d)</span><span class="cl">(Gemara) Question:</span> To which law does R. Shimon respond?</p>
<p class="bas indent1"><span class="nm">(e)</span><span class="cl">Answer #1:</span> He responds to the last law.</p>
<p class="bas indent1"><span class="nm">(f)</span><span class="cl">Rejection:</span> If so, why did R. Shimon say 'even'? Also Chachamim discuss killing a different person than intended. R. Shimon should have said only 'he is exempt.'</p>
<p class="bas indent1"><span class="nm">(g)</span><span class="cl">Answer #2:</span> He responds to the first law, 'if he intended to kill an animal, Nochri, or Nefel, and he killed a healthy Yisrael, he is exempt';</p>
<p class="bas indent2"><span class="nm">1.</span><span class="cl">Inference:</span> If one intended to kill a Yisrael and killed a different Yisrael, he is liable;</p>
<p class="bas indent2"><span class="nm">2.</span>R. Shimon argues and says that even in this case, he is exempt.</p>
<p class="bas indent1"><span class="nm">(h)</span>Obviously, if Reuven and Shimon are standing together and Levi said 'I intend to kill Reuven, and not Shimon' (and he killed Shimon), Chachamim are`Mechayev, and R. Shimon exempts.</p>
<p class="bas indent1"><span class="nm">(i)</span><span class="cl">Question #1:</span> If he said 'I want to kill one of them (I do not care which)', what is the law?</p>
<p class="bas indent1"><span class="nm">(j)</span><span class="cl">Question #2:</span> If Levi appeared to him like Reuven and therefore he killed him, what is the law?</p>
<p class="bas indent1"><span class="nm">(k)</span><span class="cl">Answer (Beraisa - R. Shimon):</span> He is not liable unless he says "I intend to kill Ploni."</p>
<p class="bas indent1"><span class="nm">(l)</span><span class="cl">Question:</span> What is R. Shimon's reason?</p>
<p class="bas indent1"><span class="nm">(m)</span><span class="cl">Answer:</span> "V'Arav Lo v'Kam Alav" - he must intend for him.</p>
<p class="bas indent1"><span class="nm">(n)</span><span class="cl">Question:</span> How do Chachamim expound this?</p>
<p class="bas indent1"><span class="nm">(o)</span><span class="cl">Answer (d'Vei R. Yanai):</span> This excludes one who throws a rock into a crowd of Yisraelim and Nochrim, without knowing whom it will kill (and it killed a Yisrael).</p>
<p class="bas indent1"><span class="nm">(p)</span><span class="cl">Question:</span> What is the case?</p>
<p class="bas indent2"><span class="nm">1.</span>If the majority are Nochrim, even without this verse we would follow the majority (and`we say that he intended to kill a Yisrael)!</p>
<p class="bas indent2"><span class="nm">2.</span>Even if half were Nochrim, we would not kill due to an even Safek!</p>
<p class="bas indent1"><span class="nm">(q)</span><span class="cl">Answer:</span> There is one Nochri and many Yisraelim. The Nochri is considered 'Kavu'a' (he did not separate from the majority). Such a case is considered like an even Safek, i.e. we do not follow the majority, so we do not kill the murderer.</p>
<p class="bas subject"><span class="nm">2)</span>DOES ONE WHO KILLED PAY MONEY?</p>
<p class="bas indent1"><span class="nm">(a)</span><span class="cl">Question:</span> We understand according to Chachamim, who say that if Levi intended to kill Reuven and killed Shimon, he is liable. They learn from "v'Chi Yinatzu Anashim Yachdav";</p>
<p class="bas indent2"><span class="nm">1.</span><span class="cl">(R. Elazar):</span> The verse discusses a fight to kill - "v'Im Ason Yihyeh v'Nosata Nefesh Tachas Nafesh" (Beis Din kills only one who intended to kill).</p>
<p class="bas indent2"><span class="nm">2.</span>However, how does R. Shimon expound the verse?</p>
<p class="bas indent1"><span class="nm">(b)</span><span class="cl">Answer:</span> R. Shimon says that it refers to paying money, like Rebbi.</p>
<p class="bas indent2"><span class="nm">1.</span><span class="cl">(Beraisa - Rebbi):</span> "V'Nosata Nefesh Tachas Nafesh" refers to money.</p>
<p class="bas indent2"><span class="nm">2.</span><span class="cl">Suggestion:</span> Perhaps it refers to capital punishment!</p>
<p class="bas indent2"><span class="nm">3.</span><span class="cl">Rejection:</span> It says 'Nesinah' here, and also regarding compensation for causing a miscarriage;</p>
<p class="bas bbbline">79b----------------------------------------79b</p>
<p class="bas indent3"><span class="nm">i.</span>Just like the latter refers to money, also here.</p>
<p class="bas indent1"><span class="nm">(c)</span><span class="cl">(Rava):</span> Tana d'Vei Chizkiyah argues with Rebbi and with Chachamim.</p>
<p class="bas indent2"><span class="nm">1.</span><span class="cl">(Tana d'Vei Chizkiyah):</span> "Makeh Adam... u'Makeh Vehemah" equates striking (killing) people and animals;</p>
<p class="bas indent2"><span class="nm">2.</span>One who strikes an animal always pays, whether he was Shogeg or Mezid, with or without intention, whether he hit going downward or upward. Similarly, one who strikes a man never pays, without distinction.</p>
<p class="bas indent1"><span class="nm">(d)</span><span class="cl">Question:</span> What does it mean 'without intention'?</p>
<p class="bas indent2"><span class="nm">1.</span>If it means without intention at all, that is Shogeg!</p>
<p class="bas indent1"><span class="nm">(e)</span><span class="cl">Answer:</span> Rather, he intended for Reuven and killed Shimon;</p>
<p class="bas indent2"><span class="nm">1.</span>The Beraisa teaches that we always exempt him from paying. If he is killed, there would be no need to teach this!</p>
<p class="bas indent2"><span class="nm">2.</span>Rather, it teaches that he is not killed, and he does not pay money.</p>
<p class="bas subject"><span class="nm">3)</span>A MURDERER WHO WAS MIXED WITH OTHERS</p>
<p class="bas indent1"><span class="nm">(a)</span><span class="cl">(Mishnah):</span> If a murderer became mixed up with others (this will be explained), all are exempt;</p>
<p class="bas indent1"><span class="nm">(b)</span>R. Yehudah says, we put them in a Kipah (a cell, and precipitate their death).</p>
<p class="bas indent1"><span class="nm">(c)</span>If people sentenced to receive different Misos Beis Din became mixed together, they all receive the lightest Misah (of any of them).</p>
<p class="bas indent1"><span class="nm">(d)</span>R. Shimon says, if people sentenced to be stoned became mixed with people sentenced to be burned, we stone them, for this is more lenient;</p>
<p class="bas indent1"><span class="nm">(e)</span>Chachamim say, we burn them, for this is more lenient.</p>
<p class="bas indent2"><span class="nm">1.</span>R. Shimon says, a Bas Kohen who was Mezanah is burned. This shows that burning is more severe;</p>
<p class="bas indent2"><span class="nm">2.</span>Chachamim say, stoning is more severe, for it is given to blasphemers and idolaters.</p>
<p class="bas indent1"><span class="nm">(f)</span>R. Shimon says, if people sentenced to be beheaded became mixed with people sentenced to be choked, we behead them;</p>
<p class="bas indent1"><span class="nm">(g)</span>Chachamim say, we choke them.</p>
<p class="bas indent1"><span class="nm">(h)</span><span class="cl">(Gemara) Question:</span> With whom did the murderer get mixed up?</p>
<p class="bas indent2"><span class="nm">1.</span><span class="cl">Suggestion:</span> He became mixed with innocent people.</p>
<p class="bas indent2"><span class="nm">2.</span><span class="cl">Rejection #1:</span> If so, obviously all are exempt!</p>
<p class="bas indent2"><span class="nm">3.</span><span class="cl">Rejection #2:</span> If so, R. Yehudah would not say that we put them in Kipah!</p>
<p class="bas indent1"><span class="nm">(i)</span><span class="cl">Answer #1 (R. Avahu):</span> A murderer who was not yet sentenced became mixed up with sentenced murderers.</p>
<p class="bas indent2"><span class="nm">1.</span>Chachamim say that he must be present (and recognizable) to pronounce the final verdict. Since we cannot do this, all are exempt.</p>
<p class="bas indent2"><span class="nm">2.</span>R. Yehudah says, we do not exempt them, since all are murderers. Therefore, we put them in Kipah.</p>
<p class="bas indent1"><span class="nm">(j)</span><span class="cl">Rejection (Reish Lakish):</span> If people became mixed up (and one was not sentenced), all agree that they are exempt;</p>
<p class="bas indent2"><span class="nm">1.</span>The Mishnah discusses an ox that was not yet sentenced (for goring) that became mixed up with sentenced oxen.</p>
<p class="bas indent2"><span class="nm">2.</span>Chachamim equate the death of the ox to what we would do to people. Since people (in this situation) would be exempt, the oxen are exempt;</p>
<p class="bas indent2"><span class="nm">3.</span>R. Yehudah says, we put them in Kipah.</p>
