<p class="bas subject"><span class="nm">1)</span>ARE <i>PARNASAH</i> AND FOOD COLLECTED FROM SOLD PROPERTY?</p>
<p class="bas indent1"><span class="nm">(a)</span><span class="cl">Question (Rav):</span> If brothers diverted the property to others, what is the law?</p>
<p class="bas indent2"><span class="nm">1.</span>R. Chiya was present when this question was delivered (to Rebbi).</p>
<p class="bas indent2"><span class="nm">2.</span><span class="cl">Question (R. Chiya):</span> Does he mean that they sold the property, or that they gave it for collateral?</p>
<p class="bas indent1"><span class="nm">(b)</span><span class="cl">Answer to both questions (Rebbi):</span> It makes no difference. In either case, daughters can collect Parnasah from it, but not food.</p>
<p class="bas indent1"><span class="nm">(c)</span><span class="cl">Question:</span> Why didn't Rav specify whether they sold it, or gave it for collateral?</p>
<p class="bas indent1"><span class="nm">(d)</span><span class="cl">Answer:</span> Rav wanted to know about both:</p>
<p class="bas indent2"><span class="nm">1.</span>Had he asked about when they sold it, and Rebbi would answer that daughters collect it, Rav would know that all the more so, if they gave it for collateral;</p>
<p class="bas indent3"><span class="nm">i.</span>However, if Rebbi would answer that it is not collected, Rav would not know about when they gave it for collateral.</p>
<p class="bas indent2"><span class="nm">2.</span>Had he asked about when they gave it for collateral, and Rebbi would answer that daughters do not collect it, Rav would know that all the more so, if they sold it;</p>
<p class="bas indent3"><span class="nm">i.</span>However, if Rebbi would answer that it is collected, Rav would not know about when they sold it.</p>
<p class="bas indent2"><span class="nm">3.</span>Therefore, he worded his question in a way that includes both.</p>
<p class="bas indent1"><span class="nm">(e)</span><span class="cl">(R. Yochanan):</span> We do not collect for food or Parnasah.</p>
<p class="bas indent1"><span class="nm">(f)</span><span class="cl">Question:</span> Did R. Yochanan not hear Rebbi's ruling, but had he heard it, he would have retracted his own ruling?</p>
<p class="bas indent2"><span class="nm">1.</span>Or, R. Yochanan heard it, but nevertheless he argued?</p>
<p class="bas indent1"><span class="nm">(g)</span><span class="cl">Answer:</span> The following shows that he had heard it.</p>
<p class="bas indent2"><span class="nm">1.</span><span class="cl">(R. Yochanan):</span> A man died, leaving two daughters and a son. One daughter took Parnasah. If the son died before the other daughter received Parnasah, she pardoned her Parnasah (and splits the remaining property with her sister);</p>
<p class="bas indent2"><span class="nm">2.</span><span class="cl">Objection (R. Chanina):</span> A bigger Chidush was taught, that we take (sold property to pay) Parnasah, but not for food. How can you say that she pardoned it?</p>
<p class="bas indent3"><span class="nm">i.</span>If R. Yochanan had not heard Rebbi's ruling, he should have asked 'Who says that Parnasah is taken from sold property (since R. Yochanan himself argues)!'</p>
<p class="bas indent1"><span class="nm">(h)</span><span class="cl">Rejection:</span> Perhaps R. Yochanan had not heard it (when he taught (e) above), but he heard it later, before R. Chanina challenged him. Even though R. Yochanan accepted the ruling, he argued with R. Chanina <i>in this case</i>, where the second daughter receives much property anyway (therefore she forfeits Parnasah).</p>
<p class="bas indent1"><span class="nm">(i)</span><span class="cl">Question (Rav Yemar):</span> According to R. Yochanan, if a girl has money because she found a Metzi'ah, does she pardon Parnasah?!</p>
<p class="bas indent1"><span class="nm">(j)</span><span class="cl">Answer (Rav Ashi):</span> No. R. Yochanan says so only when she receives a large share <i>of the estate</i>.</p>
<p class="bas subject"><span class="nm">2)</span><i>PARNASAH</i> IS LIKE A DEBT</p>
<p class="bas indent1"><span class="nm">(a)</span><span class="cl">(Ameimar):</span> A daughter who receives Parnasah is considered an heir.</p>
<p class="bas indent1"><span class="nm">(b)</span><span class="cl">Question (Rav Ashi):</span> If so, the sons cannot force her to accept money (if she wants a tenth of the land)!</p>
<p class="bas indent1"><span class="nm">(c)</span><span class="cl">Answer (Ameimar):</span> Correct!</p>
<p class="bas indent1"><span class="nm">(d)</span><span class="cl">Question (Rav Ashi):</span> If the sons want her to take the land in one place, can she demand a tenth of each piece of land?</p>
<p class="bas indent1"><span class="nm">(e)</span><span class="cl">Answer (Ameimar):</span> She can!</p>
<p class="bas indent1"><span class="nm">(f)</span><span class="cl">(Rav Ashi):</span> She is like a creditor.</p>
<p class="bas indent1"><span class="nm">(g)</span>Ameimar subsequently retracted, and agreed to Rav Ashi.</p>
<p class="bas indent2"><span class="nm">1.</span><span class="cl">(Rav Minyomi):</span> A woman came in front of Ameimar claiming Parnasah. The brothers said 'If we had money, we could force you to take it instead of the land', and Ameimar was silent.</p>
<p class="bas indent2"><span class="nm">2.</span>This shows that Ameimar agrees that they could force her to accept money.</p>
<p class="bas indent1"><span class="nm">(h)</span><span class="cl">Question:</span> Is she like a creditor of the father, or of the brothers?</p>
<p class="bas indent2"><span class="nm">1.</span>If she is a creditor of the brothers she collects middle quality land, without an oath (like a regular lender collects from the borrower);</p>
<p class="bas indent2"><span class="nm">2.</span>If she is a creditor of the father, she collects low quality land, with an oath (like a lender collects from heirs of the borrower).</p>
<p class="bas indent1"><span class="nm">(i)</span><span class="cl">Answer:</span> The following episode proves that she is a creditor of the brothers:</p>
<p class="bas indent2"><span class="nm">1.</span>Ravina authorized Rav Ashi's daughter to collect middle quality land from her brother, without an oath.</p>
<p class="bas indent2"><span class="nm">2.</span>She also collected low quality land from the son of a deceased brother, with an oath (since she was a creditor of the deceased brother, and was collecting from his heir).</p>
<p class="bas indent1"><span class="nm">(j)</span>Rav Nechemyah sent to Rabah bar Rav Huna to collect Parnasah for a certain woman, even from the base of a millstone.</p>
<p class="bas indent1"><span class="nm">(k)</span><span class="cl">Rav Ashi:</span> In Rav Kahana's academy, we used to collect for women even from rental of houses.</p>
<p class="bas indent1"><span class="nm">(l)</span>Rav Anan sent to Rav Huna 'Huna our colleague, Shalom! When this woman comes before you, collect a tenth of the estate for her.' (This was not a proper way to address Rav Huna. Even Shmuel put Rav Huna before himself!)</p>
<p class="bas indent2"><span class="nm">1.</span><span class="cl">Rav Huna (to Rav Sheshes):</span> Say the following to Rav Anan verbatim! If not, you will be excommunicated!</p>
<p class="bas indent2"><span class="nm">2.</span>'Anan, Anan! From land, or from Metaltelim? Also, who sits at the head in the house of Marzicha?'</p>
<p class="bas indent2"><span class="nm">3.</span>Rav Sheshes delivered the message verbatim, but first apologized to Rav Anan. 'You are greater than me; Rav Huna is greater than you. He said I will be in Cherem if I do not give this message. Otherwise, I would not say it! Anan, Anan...'</p>
<p class="bas indent2"><span class="nm">4.</span><span class="cl">Rav Anan (to Mar Ukva):</span> Do you see how he treated me? Also - what is Marzicha?</p>
<p class="bas bbbline">69b----------------------------------------69b</p>
<p class="bas indent2"><span class="nm">5.</span>Mar Ukva asked to hear the full story. Rav Anan explained.</p>
<p class="bas indent2"><span class="nm">6.</span><span class="cl">Mar Ukva:</span> You do not know what Marzicha is, and you called Rav Huna 'Huna, our <i>colleague'</i>?!</p>
<p class="bas indent1"><span class="nm">(m)</span><span class="cl">Question:</span> What is Marzicha?</p>
<p class="bas indent1"><span class="nm">(n)</span><span class="cl">Answer:</span> It is a mourner - "Do not come to a house of Marzach."</p>
<p class="bas indent1"><span class="nm">(o)</span><span class="cl">Question (R. Avahu):</span> How do we know that a mourner sits at the head?</p>
<p class="bas indent1"><span class="nm">(p)</span><span class="cl">Answer #1 (R. Avahu):</span> "V'Eshev Rosh...ka'Asher Avelim Yenachem"</p>
<p class="bas indent2"><span class="nm">1.</span><span class="cl">Question:</span> Yenachem connotes consoling others (the consoler is at the head)!</p>
<p class="bas indent2"><span class="nm">2.</span><span class="cl">Answer (Rav Nachman bar Yitzchak):</span> It is written (so we can read it) "Yinachem" (will be consoled. The verse could have said "Menachem' (console), which cannot be read any other way - Tosfos).</p>
<p class="bas indent1"><span class="nm">(q)</span><span class="cl">Answer #2 (Mar Zutra):</span> "V'Sar Mirzach Seruchim" - a mourner becomes a Sar (leader) to great people (who come to console him).</p>
<p class="bas indent1"><span class="nm">(r)</span><span class="cl">(Rava):</span> The Halachah is, the following are taken only from land, not from Metaltelim: feeding a widow and daughters, paying a Kesuvah, and Parnasah.</p>
<p class="bas subject"><span class="nm">3)</span>ONE WHO ENTRUSTS MONEY TO GIVE TO HIS DAUGHTER</p>
<p class="bas indent1"><span class="nm">(a)</span><span class="cl">(Mishnah - R. Meir):</span> If Levi gave money to David for Levi's daughter (for her dowry or to buy a field for her), and she says 'I trust my husband (give the money to him)', David should do like he was instructed;</p>
<p class="bas indent1"><span class="nm">(b)</span>R. Yosi says, even if he bought a field for her and she wanted to sell it, she could. It is as if it is already sold! (Therefore, we heed her.)</p>
<p class="bas indent1"><span class="nm">(c)</span>This applies to an adult; but the actions of a minor are void.</p>
<p class="bas indent1"><span class="nm">(d)</span><span class="cl">(Gemara - Beraisa - R. Meir):</span> If Levi gave money to David, to give to Levi's son-in-law to buy a field for Levi's daughter, and she says 'give it to my husband', if she is Nesu'ah, we heed her. If she is Arusah, David does like he was instructed;</p>
<p class="bas indent1"><span class="nm">(e)</span>R. Yosi says, we heed an adult, whether she is Nesu'ah or Arusah. We do not heed a minor, whether Nesu'ah or Arusah. Rather, David does like he was instructed.</p>
<p class="bas indent1"><span class="nm">(f)</span><span class="cl">Question:</span> In which case do they argue?</p>
<p class="bas indent1"><span class="nm">(g)</span><span class="cl">Answer #1:</span> They argue about a Nesu'ah minor. R. Meir says that we heed her. R. Yosi says that even if she is Nesu'ah, we heed her only if she is an adult.</p>
<p class="bas indent1"><span class="nm">(h)</span><span class="cl">Rejection - Question:</span> If so, who taught the Seifa, which says 'but the actions of a minor are void?'</p>
<p class="bas indent2"><span class="nm">1.</span>It is not R. Yosi. He already said 'it is like a field that she wants to sell', which shows that he discusses only an adult, who can sell!</p>
<p class="bas indent2"><span class="nm">2.</span><span class="cl">Answer:</span> Rather, R. Meir taught it. The Mishnah is abbreviated; it means as follows:</p>
<p class="bas indent3"><span class="nm">i.</span>David does like he was instructed. This is if she was Arusah, but if she was Nesu'ah, we heed her. This refers to an adult, but the actions of a minor are void.</p>
<p class="bas indent1"><span class="nm">(i)</span><span class="cl">Answer #2:</span> They argue about an Arusah adult. (R. Meir says, David does like he was instructed; R. Yosi says, we heed her.)</p>
<p class="bas indent1"><span class="nm">(j)</span><span class="cl">(Rav Yehudah):</span> The Halachah follows R. Yosi.</p>
<p class="bas indent1"><span class="nm">(k)</span><span class="cl">(Rava):</span> The Halachah follows R. Meir.</p>
<p class="bas subject"><span class="nm">4)</span>ONE WHO LEFT MONEY FOR HIS CHILDREN</p>
<p class="bas indent1"><span class="nm">(a)</span>(Ilfa was very poor, and went away to earn money. He returned and found out that had he stayed, he would have been appointed Rosh Yeshiva.) He hung himself on a mast.</p>
<p class="bas indent1"><span class="nm">(b)</span><span class="cl">Ilfa:</span> If anyone can say a Tosefta of R. Chiya and R. Oshaya, for which I cannot bring its source in the Mishnah, I will fall and drown!</p>
<p class="bas indent1"><span class="nm">(c)</span>An elder asked the source of the following Tosefta.</p>
<p class="bas indent2"><span class="nm">1.</span>If one said 'give a Shekel to my children each week', and they need a Sela, we give to them a Sela. If he said 'give to them only a Shekel', we give to them only a Shekel;</p>
<p class="bas indent2"><span class="nm">2.</span>If he said 'if they die, others should inherit in place of them', whether or not he said 'only', we give to them only a Shekel.</p>
<p class="bas indent1"><span class="nm">(d)</span><span class="cl">Ilfa:</span> That is like R. Meir, who says (in our Mishnah) that it is a Mitzvah to fulfill the words of the deceased.</p>
