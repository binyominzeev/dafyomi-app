<p class="bas subject"><span class="nm">1)</span>ONE WHO DIES WITHOUT SONS</p>
<p class="bas indent1"><span class="nm">(a)</span><span class="cl">(R. Yitzchak):</span> "Yerushas Peleitah l'Vinyamin v'Lo Yimacheh Shevet mi'Yisrael" teaches that they stipulated about Binyamin (after the war, when very few Bnei Binyamin remained) that a daughter of a son will not inherit with the brothers (lest she marry into a different tribe, and a large portion of Binyamin's inheritance will go to other tribes).</p>
<p class="bas indent1"><span class="nm">(b)</span><span class="cl">(R. Yochanan):</span> Hash-m hates one who dies without a son to inherit him;</p>
<p class="bas indent2"><span class="nm">1.</span>It says "v<i>'Ha'avartem</i> Es Nachalso l'Vito", similar to "Yom <i>Evrah.</i>"</p>
<p class="bas indent1"><span class="nm">(c)</span><span class="cl">(R. Yochanan or R. Yehoshua ben Levi):</span> "Asher Ein Chalifos Lamo v'Lo Yar'u Elokim" refers to one who dies without a son;</p>
<p class="bas indent1"><span class="nm">(d)</span><span class="cl">(The other of R. Yochanan and R. Yehoshua ben Levi):</span> This is one who dies without a Talmid.</p>
<p class="bas indent1"><span class="nm">(e)</span>Surely, R. Yochanan said the latter, for he would say (to console mourners) 'this is a bone (Rashbam - tooth) from my tenth son' (all died in his lifetime. He would not say this if he held that such a person does not fear Hash-m!)</p>
<p class="bas indent1"><span class="nm">(f)</span><span class="cl">Question:</span> If so, R. Yehoshua ben Levi must have said the former. However, R. Yehoshua ben Levi would (interrupt learning to) go to a house of mourning only for one who died without a son;</p>
<p class="bas indent2"><span class="nm">1.</span>Surely, he does not say that such a person does not fear Hash-m. He must say that the verse discusses one who dies without a Talmid, and R. Yochanan says that it discusses one who dies without a son;</p>
<p class="bas indent2"><span class="nm">2.</span>However, R. Yochanan publicized about himself that he lost all his sons!</p>
<p class="bas indent1"><span class="nm">(g)</span><span class="cl">Answer:</span> R. Yochanan agrees that the verse discusses one who dies without a Talmid;</p>
<p class="bas indent2"><span class="nm">1.</span>R. Yochanan said in his Rebbi's name (but he himself disagrees) that it refers to one who dies without a son.</p>
<p class="bas indent1"><span class="nm">(h)</span><span class="cl">Question (R. Pinchas ben Chama):</span> "Ki Shachav David... v'Chi Mes Yo'av" - why does it say that David <i>lied</i> (with his fathers), and that Yo'av <i>died</i>?</p>
<p class="bas indent1"><span class="nm">(i)</span><span class="cl">Answer (R. Pinchas):</span> David left a son, so it says that he lied. Yo'av left no son, so it says that he died.</p>
<p class="bas indent1"><span class="nm">(j)</span><span class="cl">Question:</span> Yo'av left a son - "mi'Benei Yo'av Ovadyah..."!</p>
<p class="bas indent1"><span class="nm">(k)</span><span class="cl">Correction:</span> Rather, David left a son like himself. Yo'av did not leave a son like himself.</p>
<p class="bas indent1"><span class="nm">(l)</span><span class="cl">(R. Pinchas ben Chama):</span> Poverty in a man's house in worse than 50 plagues - "Yad Eloka Nog'ah Bi" (the 10 Makos in Mitzrayim are called the finger of Hash-m, so the hand is like 50), and Iyov's friends answered "Zeh Bocharta me'Oni".</p>
<p class="bas indent1"><span class="nm">(m)</span><span class="cl">(R. Pinchas ben Chama):</span> If a man has a sick person in his house, he should ask a Chacham to pray for him - "v'Ish Chacham Yechaperenah".</p>
<p class="bas subject"><span class="nm">2)</span>THE ORDER OF INHERITANCE</p>
<p class="bas indent1"><span class="nm">(a)</span><span class="cl">(Mishnah):</span> The general rule is: whoever has precedence to inherit, all his descendants have precedence. A father precedes his own descendants.</p>
<p class="bas indent1"><span class="nm">(b)</span><span class="cl">Question (Rami bar Chama):</span> Who has precedence to inherit a man (Esav), his paternal grandfather (Avraham) or his paternal uncle (Yishmael)?</p>
<p class="bas indent1"><span class="nm">(c)</span><span class="cl">Answer (Rava - Mishnah):</span> A father precedes his own descendants.</p>
<p class="bas bbbline">116b----------------------------------------116b</p>
<p class="bas indent2"><span class="nm">1.</span>Rami bar Chama was distracted by another question, therefore he did not realize that the Mishnah answers his question.</p>
<p class="bas indent1"><span class="nm">(d)</span><span class="cl">Question (Rami bar Chama):</span> Who has precedence to inherit a man (Esav), his paternal grandfather (Avraham) or his brother (Yakov)?</p>
<p class="bas indent1"><span class="nm">(e)</span><span class="cl">Answer (Rava - Mishnah):</span> A father precedes his own descendants.</p>
<p class="bas indent1"><span class="nm">(f)</span>Rami bar Chama does not consider this conclusive. Perhaps it means that a father precedes his own children, but not his children's children.</p>
<p class="bas indent1"><span class="nm">(g)</span><span class="cl">Support (for the latter understanding - Mishnah):</span> The general rule is, whoever has precedence to inherit, all his descendants have precedence;</p>
<p class="bas indent2"><span class="nm">1.</span>If the father (Yitzchak) was alive, he would inherit before Avraham. Therefore, if Yitzchak is dead, his son (Yakov) inherits before Avraham.</p>
<p class="bas subject"><span class="nm">3)</span>TZELAFCHAD'S DAUGHTERS</p>
<p class="bas indent1"><span class="nm">(a)</span><span class="cl">(Mishnah):</span> Tzelafchad's daughters received three portions of Eretz Yisrael for an inheritance: the portion of Tzelafchad, who left Mitzrayim; Tzelafchad's share of Chefer's (his father) portion; and Tzelafchad's extra share of his father's portion, for Tzelafchad was a firstborn.</p>
