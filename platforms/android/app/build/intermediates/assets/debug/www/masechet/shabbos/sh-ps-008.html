<p class="bas indent1"><span class="nm">(a)</span><span class="cl">(Abaye):</span> If one threw a [wicker] basket that is 10 Tefachim tall [from Reshus ha'Yachid] to Reshus ha'Rabim:</p>
<p class="bas indent2"><span class="nm">1.</span>If its width (diameter) is less than six Tefachim wide, he is liable; if it is more than six, [since it contains a square more than four by four, it itself is a Reshus ha'Yachid,] he is exempt. (Really, he is exempt whenever it is wide enough to contain such a square, i.e. slightly more than five and three fifths - Abaye was not precise.)</p>
<p class="bas indent1"><span class="nm">(b)</span><span class="cl">(Rava):</span> Even if it is not six wide, he is exempt.</p>
<p class="bas indent1"><span class="nm">(c)</span><span class="cl">Question:</span> What is the reason?</p>
<p class="bas indent1"><span class="nm">(d)</span><span class="cl">Answer:</span> Surely, strands [of the basket] extend above 10 Tefachim, so part of the basket is in Makom Petur.</p>
<p class="bas indent1"><span class="nm">(e)</span><span class="cl">Version #1 (Rashi):</span> [If it is not six wide], if he turned it over [so the opening faces down]:</p>
<p class="bas indent2"><span class="nm">1.</span>[Even] if it is Mashehu [a tiny amount] more than seven tall, he is liable; (Even when it is considered to be Munach on account of Lavud (a Halachah from Sinai that Mechitzos less than three Tefachim apart are considered connected), i.e. it is within three Tefachim of the ground, it is entirely in Reshus ha'Rabim.)</p>
<p class="bas indent2"><span class="nm">2.</span>If it is seven and a half (or even seven and two Mashehu'im) tall, he is exempt (when it is three Tefachim less one Mashehu off the ground, it is considered Munach, and part is in Makom Petur).</p>
<p class="bas indent1"><span class="nm">(f)</span><span class="cl">Version #2 (Tosfos):</span> [If it is six wide], if he turned it over:</p>
<p class="bas indent2"><span class="nm">1.</span>[Even] if it is just over seven tall, he is liable (it is not considered Reshus ha'Yachid even when it is within three of the ground, for Lavud applies only to Mechitzos surrounding the airspace [of a Reshus], not to the walls around the bottom of the basket).</p>
<p class="bas indent2"><span class="nm">2.</span>If it is seven and a half (or even seven plus the thickness of the bottom wall plus Mashehu) tall, he is exempt (for it is considered Reshus ha'Yachid when it is within three of the ground). (end of Version #2)</p>
<p class="bas indent1"><span class="nm">(g)</span><span class="cl">(Rav Ashi):</span> Even if it is seven and a half, he is liable.</p>
<p class="bas indent1"><span class="nm">(h)</span><span class="cl">Question:</span> What is the reason?</p>
<p class="bas indent1"><span class="nm">(i)</span><span class="cl">Answer:</span> Walls of a Kli serve to store things inside (therefore we do not apply Lavud to extend them downwards).</p>
<p class="bas subject"><span class="nm">2)</span>USAGE WITH DIFFICULTY</p>
<p class="bas indent1"><span class="nm">(a)</span><span class="cl">(Ula):</span> If a pillar in Reshus ha'Rabim is nine Tefachim tall and many people use it to adjust loads (e.g. on their backs), if one threw something and it landed on the pillar, he is liable. (Rashi (on 91B) requires it to be four wide, Rashi here does not. Rosh - it can be up to 10 Tefachim; Rashi, Rambam - it must be exactly nine. Ra'avad - many people must actually use it; Rambam and Rashi (Eruvin 33A) - it suffices that it is fit for public use.)</p>
<p class="bas indent1"><span class="nm">(b)</span><span class="cl">Question:</span> What is the reason?</p>
<p class="bas indent1"><span class="nm">(c)</span><span class="cl">Answer:</span> Something [in Reshus ha'Rabim] less than three Tefachim tall [is Reshus ha'Rabim, for] people walk over it;</p>
<p class="bas indent2"><span class="nm">1.</span>Something at least three but less than nine [is Makom Petur, or Karmelis if it is at least four by four, for] people neither walk over it nor use it to adjust a load;</p>
<p class="bas indent2"><span class="nm">2.</span>Something nine tall [is Reshus ha'Rabim, for] many use it to adjust loads.</p>
<p class="bas indent1"><span class="nm">(d)</span><span class="cl">Question (Abaye):</span> What is the law of a ditch [that is nine (Rashi; Tosfos - or less) Tefachim deep]?</p>
<p class="bas indent1"><span class="nm">(e)</span><span class="cl">Answer #1 (Rav Yosef):</span> A ditch has the same law [as a pillar].</p>
<p class="bas indent1"><span class="nm">(f)</span><span class="cl">Answer #2 (Rava):</span> A ditch is different (it is Makom Petur, or Karmelis, if it is four by four).</p>
<p class="bas indent1"><span class="nm">(g)</span><span class="cl">Question:</span> What is the reason?</p>
<p class="bas indent1"><span class="nm">(h)</span><span class="cl">Answer:</span> Usage with difficulty is not considered usage (to make it Reshus ha'Rabim, i.e. one must descend into the ditch in order to adjust a load on the ground next to it).</p>
<p class="bas indent1"><span class="nm">(i)</span><span class="cl">Question (Rav Ada bar Masnah, against Rava - Beraisa):</span> If a box in Reshus ha'Rabim was 10 tall and four wide, one may not transfer from it to Reshus ha'Rabim or vice-versa;</p>
<p class="bas indent2"><span class="nm">1.</span>If it is less than this, it is permitted.</p>
<p class="bas indent2"><span class="nm">2.</span>The same applies to a ditch.</p>
<p class="bas indent2"><span class="nm">3.</span><span class="cl">Suggestion:</span> This last clause applies [even] to the Seifa (even if it is nine deep, it is permitted, for it is a Reshus ha'Rabim)!</p>
<p class="bas indent1"><span class="nm">(j)</span><span class="cl">Answer:</span> No, it applies [only] to the Reisha.</p>
<p class="bas bbbline">8b----------------------------------------8b</p>
<p class="bas indent1"><span class="nm">(k)</span><span class="cl">Question (against Rava - Beraisa):</span> (On Shabbos and Yom Tov, one may walk 2000 Amos in every direction from the place of his Shevisah (residence). If one leaves food in a place from which he could take it Bein ha'Shemashos [without transferring Reshuyos], he may declare that place to be his Shevisah - this is Eiruv Techumim.) If one intended to make Shevisah in Reshus ha'Rabim and left his Eiruv in a pit above 10 Tefachim, it is a valid Eiruv;</p>
<p class="bas indent2"><span class="nm">1.</span>If it is below 10, it is invalid.</p>
<p class="bas indent2"><span class="nm">2.</span><span class="cl">Question:</span> What is the case?</p>
<p class="bas indent3"><span class="nm">i.</span><span class="cl">Suggestion:</span> The pit is deeper than 10, 'above and below' refer to leaving the food more or less than 10 Tefachim above the bottom of the pit.</p>
<p class="bas indent3"><span class="nm">ii.</span><span class="cl">Rejection:</span> In either case [the entire pit is Reshus ha'Yachid,] he is in a different Reshus from his Eiruv (it is invalid)!</p>
<p class="bas indent2"><span class="nm">3.</span><span class="cl">Answer:</span> If the bottom of the pit is higher than 10 [Tefachim below the ground], it is a valid Eiruv.</p>
<p class="bas indent3"><span class="nm">i.</span>We must say, [such a pit is Reshus ha'Rabim because] usage with difficulty is considered usage!</p>
<p class="bas indent1"><span class="nm">(l)</span><span class="cl">Answer #1 (Rava):</span> No, it is Karmelis - the case is, also he is in a Karmelis;</p>
<p class="bas indent2"><span class="nm">1.</span>The Beraisa called it Reshus ha'Rabim, only because it is not Reshus ha'Yachid.</p>
<p class="bas indent1"><span class="nm">(m)</span><span class="cl">Answer #2 (Rava):</span> No, it is Karmelis, he is in Reshus ha'Rabim;</p>
<p class="bas indent2"><span class="nm">1.</span>The Beraisa is like Rebbi, who says that Shevus (mid'Rabanan prohibitions of Shabbos, e.g. transferring from Karmelis to Reshus ha'Rabim) does not apply Bein ha'Shemashos.</p>
<p class="bas indent1"><span class="nm">(n)</span><span class="cl">Rava:</span> Don't think that my answer is inadequate - a Mishnah supports me!</p>
<p class="bas indent2"><span class="nm">1.</span><span class="cl">(Mishnah):</span> If Reshus ha'Rabim (many people) walk through [gravel covered by] a puddle, one who throws four Amos in it is Chayav.</p>
<p class="bas indent3"><span class="nm">i.</span>The puddle must be less than 10 Tefachim [to be Reshus ha'Rabim].</p>
<p class="bas indent2"><span class="nm">2.</span>If one throws into a puddle that many people walk through, he is liable.</p>
<p class="bas indent2"><span class="nm">3.</span><span class="cl">Question:</span> We understand why the Mishnah mentions puddle twice - it needs to teach that this applies in summer and winter:</p>
<p class="bas indent3"><span class="nm">i.</span>Had it only taught about summer, we would have thought that that is because people often go there to cool off (but in winter it is not Reshus ha'Rabim);</p>
<p class="bas indent3"><span class="nm">ii.</span>Had it only taught about winter, we would have thought that that is because [the ground everywhere is muddy, so] people often go there (but in summer it is not Reshus ha'Rabim).</p>
<p class="bas indent3"><span class="nm">iii.</span>But why does the Mishnah mention 'walking' twice?</p>
<p class="bas indent2"><span class="nm">4.</span><span class="cl">Answer:</span> It teaches that walking with difficulty is considered walking, but usage with difficulty is not considered usage!</p>
<p class="bas indent1"><span class="nm">(o)</span><span class="cl">(Rav Yehudah):</span> If one transported a bundle of long reeds in Reshus ha'Rabim by repeatedly standing it on its end and casting it down in the desired direction, he is not liable unless he was Oker (moved the entire bundle four Amos without stopping in between. He is exempt even though this is the normal way to transport it, i.e. it is too heavy to carry.)</p>
<p class="bas subject"><span class="nm">3)</span>TRANSFERRING FROM A <i>MAKOM PETUR</i></p>
<p class="bas indent1"><span class="nm">(a)</span><span class="cl">(Beraisa):</span> Someone standing on a threshold [between two Reshuyos] may take from or give to a Ba'al ha'Bayis [in Reshus ha'Yachid], or take from or give to an Oni [in Reshus ha'Rabim].</p>
<p class="bas indent1"><span class="nm">(b)</span><span class="cl">Question:</span> What is the status of the threshold?</p>
<p class="bas indent2"><span class="nm">1.</span>If it is Reshus ha'Rabim, why may he take from the Ba'al ha'Bayis - he is Motzi from Reshus ha'Yachid to Reshus ha'Rabim!</p>
<p class="bas indent2"><span class="nm">2.</span>If it is Reshus ha'Rabim, why may he take from the Oni - he brings from Reshus ha'Rabim to Reshus ha'Yachid!</p>
<p class="bas indent1"><span class="nm">(c)</span><span class="cl">Answer #1:</span> It is Karmelis.</p>
<p class="bas indent1"><span class="nm">(d)</span><span class="cl">Objection:</span> Mid'Rabanan, it is forbidden to transfer from Karmelis [to either Reshus]!</p>
<p class="bas indent1"><span class="nm">(e)</span><span class="cl">Answer #2:</span> It is Makom Petur, e.g. it is less than four by four.</p>
<p class="bas indent2"><span class="nm">1.</span><span class="cl">(Rav Dimi):</span> If a place is less than four by four, both those in Reshus ha'Yachid and Reshus ha'Rabim may adjust loads on it, as long as they [people in different Reshuyos] do not switch loads.</p>
<p class="bas indent1"><span class="nm">(f)</span><span class="cl">(Beraisa):</span> He may not take from the Ba'al ha'Bayis and give the item to the Oni, nor vice-versa; if he did so, all three are exempt.</p>
<p class="bas indent1"><span class="nm">(g)</span><span class="cl">Suggestion:</span> This refutes Rava!</p>
<p class="bas indent2"><span class="nm">1.</span><span class="cl">(Rava):</span> One who transfers an item four Amos in Reshus ha'Rabim is liable, even if he carried it above 10 Tefachim.</p>
<p class="bas indent1"><span class="nm">(h)</span><span class="cl">Rejection:</span> No - in Rava's case [he is liable] because the item did not rest [in the middle] - here, it was Nach [in the middleman's hands].</p>
