<p class="bas indent1"><span class="nm">(a)</span><span class="cl">Version #1 - Rashi - (Beraisa - R. Meir):</span> If an Am ha'Aretz (or Kohen or Levi) originally did not accept a matter of Chaverus (or Leviyah or Kehunah, and now he agrees to accept everything), we never accept him;</p>
<p class="bas indent1"><span class="nm">(b)</span><span class="cl">Version #1A:</span> R. Yehudah says, if he impoved his ways only in private, we do not accept him. If he repented (even) in public, we accept him;</p>
<p class="bas indent1"><span class="nm">(c)</span><span class="cl">Version #1B (of R. Yehudah):</span> If he sinned in private (he did not descecrate Hash-m's name), we accept him. If he sinned openly, we do not accept them.</p>
<p class="bas indent1"><span class="nm">(d)</span><span class="cl">Version #2 - Tosfos - (Beraisa - R. Meir):</span> If an Am ha'Aretz (or convert, Kohen or Levi) accepted Chaverus (or the Mitzvos, Leviyah or Kehunah, and did not fulfill it), and seeks to repent, we never accept (trust) him;</p>
<p class="bas indent1"><span class="nm">(e)</span><span class="cl">Version #2A:</span> R. Yehudah says if (only) in private he returned to his sinful way, we do not accept him (for he is a deceiver). If he openly stumbled, we accept him;</p>
<p class="bas indent1"><span class="nm">(f)</span><span class="cl">Version #2B:</span> If we saw him fulfill his acceptance in private (before he sinned), we accept him. If we saw him fulfill it (only) in public, we do not accept him. (end of Version #2)</p>
<p class="bas indent1"><span class="nm">(g)</span>R. Shimon and R. Yehoshua ben Korchah say in either case we accept him - "Shuvu Banim Shovevim."</p>
<p class="bas indent1"><span class="nm">(h)</span><span class="cl">(R. Yitzchak of Ako):</span> The Halachah follows R. Shimon and R. Yehoshua.</p>
<p class="bas indent1"><span class="nm">(i)</span><span class="cl">(Beraisa):</span> Initially, if a Chaver became a tax collector, he ceased to be considered a Chaver. Even if he ceased to be a tax collector, he would not be accepted for Chaverus;</p>
<p class="bas indent2"><span class="nm">1.</span>They retracted to say that if he ceased, he is like anyone else. (He can accept Chaverus.)</p>
<p class="bas indent1"><span class="nm">(j)</span>Chachamim needed to ask questions of Rav Huna bar Chiya (Rashi; R. Gershom - he fell sick; Maharsha - he needed money, so he became a tax collector). Rabah, Rav Yosef and 400 pairs of Chachamim were heading towards him; he prepared to receive them. They heard that he became a tax collector, and sent to him "you chose what you want. We will not come to you." He promised to quit his job.</p>
<p class="bas indent1"><span class="nm">(k)</span>Rav Yosef did not go to him, for the Beraisa says that even if he ceases, he is not accepted;</p>
<p class="bas indent1"><span class="nm">(l)</span>Rabah went to him, for Chachamim retracted to say that if he ceases, he is like anyone else.</p>
<p class="bas subject"><span class="nm">2)</span>RULING ABOUT ONE'S OWN PROPERTY</p>
<p class="bas indent1"><span class="nm">(a)</span><span class="cl">(Beraisa):</span> One may inspect (a Mum on) any Bechor, except for his own;</p>
<p class="bas indent1"><span class="nm">(b)</span>He may inspect (even) his own Kodshim (except for Bechor) or Ma'aser (Behemah), and rule about his own Taharos.</p>
<p class="bas indent1"><span class="nm">(c)</span><span class="cl">Question:</span> In what case may one inspect any Bechor except for his own?</p>
<p class="bas indent2"><span class="nm">1.</span>One person may not check by himself. Three are needed!</p>
<p class="bas indent1"><span class="nm">(d)</span><span class="cl">Answer #1:</span> He is one of three that check.</p>
<p class="bas indent1"><span class="nm">(e)</span><span class="cl">Rejection:</span> If so, he would not be suspected! (He may be one of those who check his own animal.)</p>
<p class="bas indent2"><span class="nm">1.</span><span class="cl">(Mishnah):</span> If Leah did Mi'un or Chalitzah in front of Reuven, he may marry her, because this requires a Beis Din. (We do not suspect the other judges!)</p>
<p class="bas indent1"><span class="nm">(f)</span><span class="cl">Answer #2:</span> Really, he checks by himself, like Rav Chisda taught (elsewhere) that an expert is like three (regarding permitting vows);</p>
<p class="bas indent2"><span class="nm">1.</span>Here also, one expert may check a Mum.</p>
<p class="bas indent1"><span class="nm">(g)</span>He may inspect his own Kodshim (other than Bechor). He is not suspected, for he could retract his Hekdesh (like Hataras Nedarim) if he wanted;</p>
<p class="bas indent1"><span class="nm">(h)</span>He may inspect his own Ma'aser. He is not suspected, for he could have put Mumim in his entire herd before taking Ma'aser. (This is permitted, for they were Chulin at the time.)</p>
<p class="bas indent1"><span class="nm">(i)</span>He may rule about his own (Chulin) Taharos. He is not suspected, for even if they are Teme'im, he could eat them when he is Tamei.</p>
<p class="perekline">PEREK KOL PESULEI HA'MUKDASHIM</p>
<p class="bas subject"><span class="nm">3)</span>SELLING PESULEI HA'MUKDASHIM</p>
<p class="bas indent1"><span class="nm">(a)</span><span class="cl">(Mishnah):</span> All Pesulei ha'Mukdashim may be slaughtered and sold in the Itliz (meat market, even though this is a disgrace to Hekdesh), except for Bechor and Ma'aser, for the Hana'ah (benefit, i.e. money received for them) belongs to the owner;</p>
<p class="bas indent2"><span class="nm">1.</span>The Hana'ah of (other) Kodshim is Hekdesh. (It is used to buy a similar Korban.)</p>
<p class="bas indent1"><span class="nm">(b)</span>One may weigh meat of Bechor against meat (Rambam - of Bechor, to equate the portions; Rashi - of Chulin, of a known weight).</p>
<p class="bas bbbline">31b----------------------------------------31b</p>
<p class="bas indent1"><span class="nm">(c)</span><span class="cl">(Gemara) Question:</span> What is the case (in which Hana'ah of Kodshim is Hekdesh)?</p>
<p class="bas indent2"><span class="nm">1.</span>It is not after redemption. Money received after Pidyon belongs to the owner!</p>
<p class="bas indent1"><span class="nm">(d)</span><span class="cl">Answer #1:</span> It must be before Pidyon.</p>
<p class="bas indent1"><span class="nm">(e)</span><span class="cl">Question:</span> If they are slaughtered, Pidyon will be impossible, for Ha'amadah and Ha'arachah (standing it up before a Kohen for appraisal) must be done first!</p>
<p class="bas indent2"><span class="nm">1.</span>There is no question according to the opinion that Ha'amadah and Ha'arachah do not apply to Kodshei Mizbe'ach. We ask only according to the opinion that they do apply.</p>
<p class="bas indent1"><span class="nm">(f)</span><span class="cl">Answer #2:</span> Really, it is after Pidyon;</p>
<p class="bas indent2"><span class="nm">1.</span>When appraising them, the Kohen knows that they may be slaughtered and sold in the Itliz and weighed normally, so he sets a higher redemption price. This is Hana'ah for Hekdesh.</p>
<p class="bas indent1"><span class="nm">(g)</span><span class="cl">(Mishnah):</span> Except for Bechor and Ma'aser, for the Hana'ah belongs to the owner.</p>
<p class="bas indent1"><span class="nm">(h)</span><span class="cl">Question:</span> Granted, one may not sell Bechor in the Itliz, but one may sell it in his house;</p>
<p class="bas indent2"><span class="nm">1.</span>However, it is misleading to say that Ma'aser may not be sold in the Itliz. It may not be sold anywhere!</p>
<p class="bas indent3"><span class="nm">i.</span><span class="cl">(Beraisa):</span> It says about Bechor "Lo Sifdeh." It may be sold (even) while alive;</p>
<p class="bas indent3"><span class="nm">ii.</span>It says about Ma'aser "Lo Yiga'el," it may not be sold alive or slaughtered, Tam or Ba'al Mum.</p>
<p class="bas indent1"><span class="nm">(i)</span><span class="cl">Answer (Rav Sheshes, based on a Beraisa):</span> The Mishnah alludes to Ma'aser Behemah of orphans. It may be sold (privately in the house) to avoid a loss.</p>
<p class="bas indent1"><span class="nm">(j)</span>His servant, Rav Idi, said this in the Beis Medrash, without citing Rav Sheshes; when Rav Sheshes found out, he was upset.</p>
<p class="bas indent1"><span class="nm">(k)</span><span class="cl">Rav Sheshes:</span> One who stings should be stung by a scorpion (i.e. excommunicated)!</p>
<p class="bas indent1"><span class="nm">(l)</span><span class="cl">Question:</span> Why was Rav Sheshes upset?</p>
<p class="bas indent1"><span class="nm">(m)</span><span class="cl">Answer - Question (Rav Yehudah):</span> How do we understand "Agurah b'Ohalcha <i>Olamim</i>"? Can one live in two worlds?</p>
<p class="bas indent2"><span class="nm">1.</span><span class="cl">Answer (Rav Yehudah):</span> David requested that teachings be said in his name in this world (after his death);</p>
<p class="bas indent2"><span class="nm">2.</span><span class="cl">(R. Yochanan):</span> If a teaching is said in the name of a deceased Chacham, his lips move (Tosfos Yeshanim - drip) in the grave.</p>
<p class="bas indent2"><span class="nm">3.</span><span class="cl">(R. Yitzchak bar Ze'iri):</span> He learns from "v'Chikech k'Yein ha'Tov... Dovev Sifsei Yeshenim";</p>
<p class="bas indent2"><span class="nm">4.</span>His lips are like a bucket of grapes. If they are touched, they move (Tosfos Yeshanim - they exude juice).</p>
<p class="bas subject"><span class="nm">4)</span>THE HETER TO SELL MA'ASAR BEHEMAH</p>
<p class="bas indent1"><span class="nm">(a)</span><span class="cl">Question:</span> Which Beraisa did Rav Sheshes learn from?</p>
<p class="bas indent1"><span class="nm">(b)</span><span class="cl">Answer (Beraisa):</span> Ma'aser Behemah of orphans may be sold;</p>
<p class="bas indent2"><span class="nm">1.</span>(The meat of) a slaughtered Ma'aser Behemah may be sold b'Havla'ah (together, for one price) with the skin, Chelev, Gidim and horns. (He sells these for an inflated price, and gives the meat for free with them.)</p>
<p class="bas indent1"><span class="nm">(c)</span><span class="cl">Question:</span> What does this mean? (First it says that Ma'aser may be sold (normally), then it says that it may be sold only b'Havla'ah!)</p>
<p class="bas indent1"><span class="nm">(d)</span><span class="cl">Answer #1 (Abaye):</span> A (slaughtered) Ma'aser Behemah of orphans may be sold b'Havla'ah.</p>
<p class="bas indent2"><span class="nm">1.</span><span class="cl">Inference:</span> Ma'aser Behemah of adults may not be sold (even) b'Havla'ah.</p>
<p class="bas indent2"><span class="nm">2.</span><span class="cl">Question:</span> Why is this different than an Esrog of Shemitah, which may be sold b'Havla'ah?</p>
<p class="bas indent3"><span class="nm">i.</span><span class="cl">(Mishnah):</span> When one buys a Lulav from an Am ha'Aretz in Shemitah, the seller gives an Esrog for a gift, for one may not buy it. (We do not pay an Am ha'Aretz for Shemitah produce, lest he not treat the money with Kedushas Shemitah. One may buy the Lulav, for it is inedible, so it and the money paid for it have no Kedushah.)</p>
<p class="bas indent3"><span class="nm">ii.</span><span class="cl">Question:</span> What can one do if the seller does not agree to give it for a gift?</p>
<p class="bas indent3"><span class="nm">iii.</span><span class="cl">Answer (Rav Huna):</span> One buys it b'Havla'ah with the Lulav.</p>
<p class="bas indent2"><span class="nm">3.</span><span class="cl">Answer:</span> Regarding an Esrog, the ruse is not evident, for the price charged for the Lulav is reasonable (Esrogim are relatively cheap);</p>
<p class="bas indent3"><span class="nm">i.</span>Regarding Ma'aser, the ruse is evident, for the meat is worth much more than the skin (and Chelev, etc.) No one would pay so much for skin alone.</p>
<p class="bas indent1"><span class="nm">(e)</span><span class="cl">Objection (Rava):</span> If the Beraisa were all one clause, it would not say "Ma'aser Behemah"... and then repeat "Ma'aser Behemah"!</p>
<p class="bas indent1"><span class="nm">(f)</span><span class="cl">Answer #2 (Rava):</span> It means that Ma'aser Behemah of orphans may be sold normally;</p>
<p class="bas indent2"><span class="nm">1.</span>A slaughtered Ma'aser of an adult may be sold b'Havla'ah with the skin, etc... .</p>
<p class="bas indent1"><span class="nm">(g)</span><span class="cl">(Rava):</span> I learn from "(v'Lo Yemirenu... v'Im Hamer Yemirenu) v'Hayah Hu u'Semuraso Yihyeh Kodesh Lo Yiga'el" - just like Temurah applies while it is alive, also the Isur to sell it;</p>
<p class="bas indent2"><span class="nm">1.</span>Chachamim decreed against selling it after Shechitah, lest one sell it before Shechitah;</p>
<p class="bas indent2"><span class="nm">2.</span>They decreed only about what is (important and) commonly sold in the animal's lifetime (i.e. meat);</p>
<p class="bas indent2"><span class="nm">3.</span>Chachamim did not decree concerning orphans.</p>
