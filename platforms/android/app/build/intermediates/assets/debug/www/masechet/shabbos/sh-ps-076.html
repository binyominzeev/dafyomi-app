<p class="bas subject"><span class="nm">1)</span><i>SHI'URIM</i> OF <i>HOTZA'AH</i> FOR ANIMAL FOOD</p>
<p class="bas indent1"><span class="nm">(a)</span><span class="cl">(Mishnah):</span> If one was Motzi any of the following [he is liable]:</p>
<p class="bas indent2"><span class="nm">1.</span>Enough Teven (hard straw that remains in the ground when harvesting) to fill a cow's mouth, a camel's mouth full of Etzah (this will be explained), a lamb's mouth full of Amir (Kash, soft straw that is harvested with the grain), a kid's mouth full of grass, a k'Grogeres of moist leaves of garlic and onions (people eat them), or a kid's mouth of them if they are dry.</p>
<p class="bas indent1"><span class="nm">(b)</span>Different foods do not join with each other because the Shi'urim are different.</p>
<p class="bas indent1"><span class="nm">(c)</span><span class="cl">(Gemara) Question:</span> What is Etzah?</p>
<p class="bas indent1"><span class="nm">(d)</span><span class="cl">Answer (Rav Yehudah):</span> It is straw of legumes.</p>
<p class="bas indent1"><span class="nm">(e)</span><span class="cl">Version #1 (Rav Dimi):</span> At night, R. Yochanan said that if one was Motzi a cow's mouth full of straw for a camel, he is liable; Reish Lakish exempts;</p>
<p class="bas indent2"><span class="nm">1.</span>In the morning, R. Yochanan retracted.</p>
<p class="bas indent1"><span class="nm">(f)</span><span class="cl">Rav Yosef:</span> It was proper that he retracted - camels do not eat straw!</p>
<p class="bas indent1"><span class="nm">(g)</span><span class="cl">Abaye:</span> No, his first ruling was better - it is fitting for a cow (intent to feed to a camel does not exempt)!</p>
<p class="bas indent1"><span class="nm">(h)</span><span class="cl">Version #2 (Ravin):</span> All agree that if one was Motzi a cow's mouth full of straw for a camel, he is liable;</p>
<p class="bas indent1"><span class="nm">(i)</span>They argue about a cow's mouth full of Etzah for a cow, but unlike Rav Dimi said - R. Yochanan exempts, Reish Lakish is Mechayev.</p>
<p class="bas indent2"><span class="nm">1.</span>R. Yochanan exempts - he holds that eating [something eaten only] on account of pressed circumstances is not considered eating;</p>
<p class="bas indent2"><span class="nm">2.</span>Reish Lakish obligates - he holds that eating due to pressed circumstances is considered eating.</p>
<p class="bas indent1"><span class="nm">(j)</span><span class="cl">(Mishnah):</span> A lamb's mouth full of Amir.</p>
<p class="bas indent1"><span class="nm">(k)</span><span class="cl">Contradiction (Beraisa):</span> One is liable for a k'Grogeres of Amir.</p>
<p class="bas indent1"><span class="nm">(l)</span><span class="cl">Resolution:</span> Both of these are the same amount.</p>
<p class="bas indent1"><span class="nm">(m)</span><span class="cl">(Mishnah):</span> K'Grogeres of moist leaves of garlic and onions, or a kid's mouth of them if they are dry; different foods do not join because the Shi'urim are different.</p>
<p class="bas indent1"><span class="nm">(n)</span><span class="cl">(R. Yosi b'Rebbi Chanina):</span> They do not join to the smaller Shi'ur, but they join to the larger Shi'ur.</p>
<p class="bas indent1"><span class="nm">(o)</span><span class="cl">Question:</span> Things with different Shi'urim do not join!</p>
<p class="bas indent2"><span class="nm">1.</span><span class="cl">(Mishnah):</span> The Shi'urim [to receive Tum'as Medras] for fabric, sackcloth, leather and matting are, respectively, three Tefachim by three [Tefachim], four by four [Tefachim], five by five and six by six.</p>
<p class="bas indent2"><span class="nm">2.</span><span class="cl">(Mishnah):</span> The following join [for the Shi'ur] - fabric and sackcloth, sackcloth and leather, leather and matting. (Tosfos - only the pairs listed join, for they connect well. Bartenura (Me'ilah) - all the materials join to comprise the largest Shi'ur among them.)</p>
<p class="bas indent2"><span class="nm">3.</span>R. Shimon says, they join because a common Shi'ur of Moshav applies to all of them. (If one cut from any one (Tosfos; Rashi - two) of them and made a patch [for a saddle] at least one Tefach, it is Mekabel Tum'as Moshav.)</p>

<p class="bas subject"><span class="nm">2)</span>WHICH THINGS COMBINE TO COMPLETE A <i>SHI'UR</i> FOR <i>HOTZA'AH</i>?</p>
<p class="bas indent1"><span class="nm">(a)</span><span class="cl">(Mishnah):</span>  If one was Motzi k'Grogeres of [human] food, he is liable; different foods join with each other because they have the same Shi'ur.</p>
<p class="bas indent1"><span class="nm">(b)</span>Shells, pits, stems, bran and coarse bran do not help comprise the Shi'ur;</p>
<p class="bas indent1"><span class="nm">(c)</span>R. Yehudah says, [inner] shells of lentil that are cooked with the lentils join.</p>
<p class="bas indent1"><span class="nm">(d)</span><span class="cl">(Gemara) Question:</span> Bran and coarse bran do help comprise a Shi'ur!</p>
<p class="bas indent2"><span class="nm">1.</span><span class="cl">(Mishnah):</span> [If a dough was made with] more than a Kav and a quarter of flour, Chalah must be taken;</p>
<p class="bas indent2"><span class="nm">2.</span>The bran and coarse bran are included for the Shi'ur.</p>
<p class="bas indent1"><span class="nm">(e)</span><span class="cl">Answer (Abaye):</span> They are included regarding Chalah because an Oni does not remove them when making [flour to make] bread (but they do not join for Shabbos, since normally they are not eaten).</p>
<p class="bas indent1"><span class="nm">(f)</span><span class="cl">(Mishnah - R. Yehudah):</span> Lentil shells join, for they are cooked with them.</p>
<p class="bas indent1"><span class="nm">(g)</span><span class="cl">Inference:</span> Lentil shells join, but not bean shells.</p>
<p class="bas indent1"><span class="nm">(h)</span><span class="cl">Contradiction (Beraisa - R. Yehudah):</span> ...Except for shells of lentils and beans.</p>
<p class="bas indent1"><span class="nm">(i)</span><span class="cl">Resolution:</span> Shells of fresh beans join, shells of old beans do not join.</p>
<p class="bas indent1"><span class="nm">(j)</span><span class="cl">Question:</span> Why don't shells of old beans join?</p>
<p class="bas indent1"><span class="nm">(k)</span><span class="cl">Answer (R. Avahu):</span> This is because they [are black, they] looks like flies in the bowl [so people usually remove the shells].</p>

<p class="bas subject"><span class="nm">3)</span>THE <i>SHI'URIM</i> OF <i>HOTZA'AH</i> FOR LIQUIDS</p>
<p class="bas indent1"><span class="nm">(a)</span><span class="cl">(Mishnah):</span> If one was Motzi any of the following [he is liable]:</p>
<p class="bas indent2"><span class="nm">1.</span>Enough [raw, i.e. undiluted] wine to mix [with water] to comprise a cup (these Shi'urim will be explained), Kedai Gemi'ah (a gulp; alternatively, Malei Lugmav, the amount that one can hold in his mouth when one cheek sticks out) of milk, enough honey to put on Kasis (a wound on an animal's back or leg; Ritva - a wound on a person), enough oil to anoint a small limb, enough water to dissolve into Kilor (an ointment for the eye);</p>
<p class="bas indent1"><span class="nm">(b)</span>The Shi'ur for all other liquids, including waste water, is a Revi'is.</p>
<p class="bas indent1"><span class="nm">(c)</span>R. Shimon says, the Shi'ur for <i>all</i> liquids is a Revi'is [for most people] - all the [smaller] Shi'urim are for one who saves them.</p>
<p class="bas indent1"><span class="nm">(d)</span><span class="cl">(Gemara - Beraisa):</span> The Mishnah refers to the amount of wine to mix a nice cup.</p>
<p class="bas indent1"><span class="nm">(e)</span><span class="cl">Question:</span> What is this?</p>
<p class="bas indent1"><span class="nm">(f)</span><span class="cl">Answer:</span> It is the Kos of Berachah (over which we say Birkas ha'Mazon).</p>
