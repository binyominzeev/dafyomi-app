<p class="bas indent1"><span class="nm">(a)</span>Two people once testified that they saw the moon in the east at morning and in the west at night.</p>
<p class="bas indent2"><span class="nm">1.</span>R. Yochanan ben Nuri rejected their testimony, but Raban Gamliel accepted it.</p>
<p class="bas indent1"><span class="nm">(b)</span>Two people once testified that they saw the moon on the day of the 30th, but it was not seen the following evening.</p>
<p class="bas indent2"><span class="nm">1.</span>Raban Gamliel accepted their testimony.</p>
<p class="bas indent2"><span class="nm">2.</span><span class="cl">(R. Dosa ben Hurkenos):</span> "They are false; it is like a woman giving birth later being seen pregnant!"</p>
<p class="bas indent2"><span class="nm">3.</span><span class="cl">(R. Yehoshua):</span> Agreed.</p>
<p class="bas indent2"><span class="nm">4.</span>Raban Gamliel ordered R. Yehoshua to come to him with his stick and money on the 11th of Tishrei (which he would consider to be Yom Kipur).</p>
<p class="bas indent2"><span class="nm">5.</span>R. Akiva comforted him by telling him that Rosh Chodesh is whenever Beis Din say it is, correct or not.</p>
<p class="bas indent2"><span class="nm">6.</span>R. Dosa ben Hurkenos pointed out that analyzing the accuracy of Raban Gamliel's judgments would also require analyzing the accuracy of all previous Batei Din.</p>
<p class="bas indent3"><span class="nm">i.</span>The seventy elders in Moshe's Beis Din are not named so that the Beis Din of any generation can be argued to be as great.</p>
<p class="bas indent2"><span class="nm">7.</span>When R. Yehoshua went to Raban Gamliel, he kissed him, calling him his master in wisdom, and his student in obedience.</p>
<p class="bas subject"><span class="nm">2)</span>LUNAR PHENOMENAE</p>
<p class="bas indent1"><span class="nm">(a)</span><span class="cl">(Raban Gamliel):</span> Sometimes the moon's orbit is long, sometimes short.</p>
<p class="bas indent2"><span class="nm">1.</span>The source is a Pasuk which states that the sun has a regular path, but (by implication) not the moon.</p>
<p class="bas indent1"><span class="nm">(b)</span>R. Chiya saw the old moon on the morning of the 29th of Elul;</p>
<p class="bas indent2"><span class="nm">1.</span>He threw a clod of earth at it, as he wanted it to be invisible now so that the new one could appear at night (and the month could be abridged, thereby separating Yom Kipur from Shabbos).</p>
<p class="bas indent2"><span class="nm">2.</span>Rebbi told him to go to Ein Tav and sanctify Rosh Chodesh there, and to send the message "David Melech Yisrael..."</p>
<p class="bas indent1"><span class="nm">(c)</span><span class="cl">(Beraisa):</span> Once, it looked like a new moon had appeared on the 29th, and they wanted to declare Rosh Chodesh.</p>
<p class="bas indent2"><span class="nm">1.</span>Raban Gamliel told them that a month cannot be shorter than 29 1/2 days, 40 minutes and 73 Chalakim.</p>
<p class="bas indent2"><span class="nm">2.</span>He gave an extensive Hesped on that day to publicize that it was not Rosh Chodesh.</p>
<p class="bas subject"><span class="nm">3)</span>R. AKIVA'S SOLACE</p>
<p class="bas indent1"><span class="nm">(a)</span><span class="cl">Question:</span> Was R. Yehoshua in distress, or R. Akiva?</p>
<p class="bas indent1"><span class="nm">(b)</span><span class="cl">Answer:</span> R. Yehoshua was in distress, wishing to fall sick for a year rather than have to travel on what he considered to be Yom Kipur.</p>
<p class="bas indent2"><span class="nm">1.</span>R. Akiva, with his permission, pointed out that the Pasuk says "You" three times to teach that Beis Din's decisions on the calendar stand even if they are mistaken, deliberately inaccurate, or based on false testimony.</p>
<p class="bas indent2"><span class="nm">2.</span>R. Yehoshua told him that he had comforted him.</p>
<p class="bas subject"><span class="nm">4)</span>ACCEPTING THE LEADERS OF ONE'S GENERATION</p>
<p class="bas indent1"><span class="nm">(a)</span><span class="cl">(Beraisa):</span> The names of the seventy elders are not mentioned so as to prevent people from saying, "Are our judges like Moshe and all the rest?!"</p>
<p class="bas indent1"><span class="nm">(b)</span>Likewise, the Pasuk states that Hash-m sent Yeruba'al, Badan and Yiftach;</p>
<p class="bas indent2"><span class="nm">1.</span>Gidon was called Yeruba'al because he fought against Ba'al.</p>
<p class="bas indent2"><span class="nm">2.</span>Shimshon was called Badan because he was descended from Dan.</p>
<p class="bas bbbline">25b----------------------------------------25b</p>
<p class="bas indent2"><span class="nm">3.</span>Another Pasuk equates Shmuel with Moshe and Aharon.</p>
<p class="bas indent2"><span class="nm">4.</span>In combination, the Pesukim equates the first three (lesser) people with the last three (greater) people, teaching us that each was just as great for his generation.</p>
<p class="bas indent2"><span class="nm">5.</span>This teaches us that even the least of people who is appointed over the community is as the greatest.</p>
<p class="bas indent1"><span class="nm">(c)</span>Likewise, the Pasuk instructs a person to go to the judge "of his day"; obviously there's no other judge to got to, but it teaches us that none other should be wanted.</p>
<p class="bas indent1"><span class="nm">(d)</span>Likewise, the Pasuk tells us not to say that earlier generations were superior.</p>
<p class="bas subject"><span class="nm">5)</span>RABAN GAMLIEL'S RECEPTION OF R. YEHOSHUA</p>
<p class="bas indent1"><span class="nm">(a)</span>When Raban Gamliel saw R. Yehoshua, he stood up and kissed him.</p>
<p class="bas indent1"><span class="nm">(b)</span>He said, "Welcome, my teacher (of Torah in public) and my disciple (who accepts my orders;"</p>
<p class="bas indent1"><span class="nm">(c)</span>"...Happy is the generation where the elders listen to the juniors, and Kal v'Chomer vice-versa."</p>
<p class="bas indent2"><span class="nm">1.</span><span class="cl">Question:</span> It isn't a Kal v'Chomer - it's an obligation!?</p>
<p class="bas indent2"><span class="nm">2.</span><span class="cl">Answer:</span> It means, since the elders listen to the juniors, the juniors will make a Kal v'Chomer for themselves.</p>
<p class="perekline">PEREK RA'UHU BEIS DIN</p>
<p class="bas subject"><span class="nm">6)</span><i>MISHNAH:</i> SANCTIFYING THE MOON</p>
<p class="bas indent1"><span class="nm">(a)</span>If Beis Din and all Israel saw the moon (on the 30th), witnesses were examined, and they didn't manage to say Mekudash before dark, it is a full month.</p>
<p class="bas indent1"><span class="nm">(b)</span>If Beis Din alone saw it, two of them should testify before the others.</p>
<p class="bas indent1"><span class="nm">(c)</span>If Beis Din alone saw it and there are only three of them, then two testify and the other is joined by other Dayanim.</p>
<p class="bas indent2"><span class="nm">1.</span>This is because the single Dayan cannot sanctify it on his own.</p>
<p class="bas subject"><span class="nm">7)</span>THE CASES OF THE <i>MISHNAH</i></p>
<p class="bas indent1"><span class="nm">(a)</span><span class="cl">Question:</span> Why state that all Israel saw it (seeing as Beis Din anyway saw it)?</p>
<p class="bas indent1"><span class="nm">(b)</span><span class="cl">Answer:</span> One might think that since all Israel saw it, it is public knowledge and shouldn't be made a full month.</p>
<p class="bas indent1"><span class="nm">(c)</span><span class="cl">Question:</span> Since they all saw it, why does the Mishnah need to state that witnesses were examined?</p>
<p class="bas indent1"><span class="nm">(d)</span><span class="cl">Answer:</span> It means "<i>or</i>" witnesses were examined.</p>
<p class="bas indent1"><span class="nm">(e)</span><span class="cl">Question:</span> Since when everyone saw it, it didn't help, obviously it won't help if witnesses were examined either?</p>
<p class="bas indent1"><span class="nm">(f)</span><span class="cl">Answer:</span> One might think that the sanctification is a conclusion of a single process that began with the witness examination by day, and is therefore valid even if done after dark;</p>
<p class="bas indent2"><span class="nm">1.</span>This would be similar to monetary judgments that can finish at night if begun by day.</p>
<p class="bas indent2"><span class="nm">2.</span><span class="cl">Question:</span> Why is this not indeed true?</p>
<p class="bas indent2"><span class="nm">3.</span><span class="cl">Answer:</span> The Pasuk calls the sanctification of the moon a Chok, which refers to the end of the process, and calls it a Mishpat, which must be done by day.</p>
<p class="bas subject"><span class="nm">8)</span><i>DAYANIM </i>AS WITNESSES AND WITNESSES AS <i>DAYANIM</i></p>
<p class="bas indent1"><span class="nm">(a)</span><span class="cl">Question:</span> What is the point of two Dayanim testifying before the others - why should hearing it be any better than seeing it?</p>
<p class="bas indent1"><span class="nm">(b)</span><span class="cl">Answer:</span> If it was seen at night, then seeing it is not adequate for sanctifying it.</p>
<p class="bas indent1"><span class="nm">(c)</span><span class="cl">Question:</span> What is the point of two Dayanim (in the third case) testifying before the other one - why should hearing it be any better than seeing it?</p>
<p class="bas indent2"><span class="nm">1.</span><span class="cl">Attempted answer:</span> It is referring to where they saw it at night.</p>
<p class="bas indent2"><span class="nm">2.</span><span class="cl">Objection:</span> It is the same Chidush as the earlier case!</p>
<p class="bas indent1"><span class="nm">(d)</span><span class="cl">Answer:</span> The Chidush is in the latter part, that one Dayan alone may not sanctify it.</p>
<p class="bas indent1"><span class="nm">(e)</span>One might think that it should be like monetary matters, which require three judges unless one is an expert.</p>
<p class="bas indent2"><span class="nm">1.</span><span class="cl">Question:</span> Why is it not like that?</p>
<p class="bas indent2"><span class="nm">2.</span><span class="cl">Answer:</span> There was no-one more expert than Moshe, and Hash-m said that Aharon was needed also.</p>
<p class="bas indent1"><span class="nm">(f)</span>We see here that a potential witness can act as a Dayan instead.</p>
<p class="bas indent1"><span class="nm">(g)</span><span class="cl">Question:</span> The Mishnah therefore seems not to follow R. Akiva:</p>
<p class="bas indent2"><span class="nm">1.</span><span class="cl">(R. Tarfon):</span> If the Sanhedrin saw a murder, some can act as witnesses and the others as Dayanim.</p>
<p class="bas indent2"><span class="nm">2.</span><span class="cl">(R. Akiva):</span> They must all act as witnesses and none can act as Dayanim.</p>
<p class="bas indent1"><span class="nm">(h)</span><span class="cl">Answer:</span> R. Akiva only held that view in cases of murder, where the Torah wants the Dayanim to find him innocent, which they won't do if they saw him do it.</p>
