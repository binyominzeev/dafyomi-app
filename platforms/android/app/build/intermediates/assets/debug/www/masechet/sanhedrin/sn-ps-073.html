<p class="bas subject"><span class="nm">1)</span>KILLING SOMEONE BEFORE HE SINS</p>
<p class="bas indent1"><span class="nm">(a)</span><span class="cl">(Mishnah):</span> An onlooker may kill any of the following to prevent them from transgressing:</p>
<p class="bas indent2"><span class="nm">1.</span>A Rodef;</p>
<p class="bas indent2"><span class="nm">2.</span>A man chasing a man to have Bi'ah with him, or a man chasing a Na'arah Me'orasah to rape her.</p>
<p class="bas indent1"><span class="nm">(b)</span>An onlooker may not kill someone chasing an animal for bestiality, or one who seeks to desecrate Shabbos, or to serve idolatry.</p>
<p class="bas indent1"><span class="nm">(c)</span><span class="cl">(Gemara - Beraisa) Question:</span> What is the source that we may kill a Rodef?</p>
<p class="bas indent1"><span class="nm">(d)</span><span class="cl">Answer #1:</span> "Lo Sa'amod Al Dam Re'echa."</p>
<p class="bas indent1"><span class="nm">(e)</span><span class="cl">Objection:</span> We need this to teach the following!</p>
<p class="bas indent2"><span class="nm">1.</span><span class="cl">(Beraisa):</span> If Reuven sees Shimon drowning in a river, or being dragged by an animal, or being pursued by bandits, he must save him - "Lo Sa'amod Al Dam Re'echa." (Perhaps this is only if he can save without killing the bandits, or if they are not Yisraelim, but one may not kill a Rodef.)</p>
<p class="bas indent1"><span class="nm">(f)</span><span class="cl">Answer #2:</span> We learn a Kal va'Chomer from Na'arah Me'orasah. We kill one who seeks to rape her, even though he intends only to blemish her. All the more so, we kill one who seeks to kill someone!</p>
<p class="bas indent1"><span class="nm">(g)</span><span class="cl">Objection:</span> We do not punish based on a Kal va'Chomer!</p>
<p class="bas indent1"><span class="nm">(h)</span><span class="cl">Answer #3 (d'Vei Rebbi):</span> We learn from a Hekesh from Na'arah Me'orasah - "Ki Ka'asher... u'Retzacho Nefesh (the law of Na'arah Me'orasah is like Rotze'ach).</p>
<p class="bas indent2"><span class="nm">1.</span><span class="cl">Question:</span> We do not learn Na'arah Me'orasah from Rotze'ach. The Torah explicitly says that we do not kill her, for she was Anusah!</p>
<p class="bas indent2"><span class="nm">2.</span><span class="cl">Answer:</span> The verse seems to learn Na'arah Me'orasah from Rotze'ach, but really, Na'arah Me'orasah teaches about Rotze'ach;</p>
<p class="bas indent3"><span class="nm">i.</span>It equates Na'arah Me'orasah and Rotze'ach. Just like one can kill one who seeks to rape a Na'arah Me'orasah to save her, one can kill a Rodef to save the victim.</p>
<p class="bas indent1"><span class="nm">(i)</span><span class="cl">Question:</span> What is the source to kill one who seeks to rape a Na'arah Me'orasah?</p>
<p class="bas indent1"><span class="nm">(j)</span><span class="cl">Answer (Tana d'Vei R. Yishmael):</span> "V'Ein Moshi'a Lah" - if someone can save her, he does whatever is necessary (he may kill the rapist).</p>
<p class="bas indent1"><span class="nm">(k)</span><span class="cl">(Beraisa):</span> If Reuven sees Shimon drowning in a river, or being dragged by an animal, or being pursued by bandits, he must save him - "Lo Sa'amod Al Dam Re'echa."</p>
<p class="bas indent1"><span class="nm">(l)</span><span class="cl">Question:</span> A different verse teaches this!</p>
<p class="bas indent2"><span class="nm">1.</span><span class="cl">(Beraisa) Question:</span> If one is in danger of dying, what is the source that one must save him?</p>
<p class="bas indent2"><span class="nm">2.</span><span class="cl">Answer:</span> "Va'Hashevoso Lo."</p>
<p class="bas indent1"><span class="nm">(m)</span><span class="cl">Answer:</span> From there, we would know that an onlooker must exert himself to save him, but we would not know that (if he cannot) he must hire others to save him;</p>
<p class="bas indent2"><span class="nm">1.</span>"Lo Sa'amod Al Dam Re'echa" teaches that he must hire others.</p>
<p class="bas subject"><span class="nm">2)</span>WHEN MAY WE KILL?</p>
<p class="bas indent1"><span class="nm">(a)</span><span class="cl">(Beraisa):</span> An onlooker may kill any of the following to prevent them from transgressing:</p>
<p class="bas indent2"><span class="nm">1.</span>A Rodef;</p>
<p class="bas indent2"><span class="nm">2.</span>A man chasing a man for the sake of Mishkav Zachar;</p>
<p class="bas indent2"><span class="nm">3.</span>A man chasing a Na'arah Me'orasah (to rape her), or any other Ervah punishable by Misah or Kares.</p>
<p class="bas indent1"><span class="nm">(b)</span>We do not kill a Kohen Gadol chasing a widow, or a regular Kohen chasing a divorcee or Chalutzah (for these are only Chayavei Lavin).</p>
<p class="bas indent1"><span class="nm">(c)</span>If he already sinned with her, we do not kill him.</p>
<p class="bas indent1"><span class="nm">(d)</span>If someone can save her (without killing him), we do not kill him.</p>
<p class="bas indent1"><span class="nm">(e)</span>R. Yehudah says, even if she says '?o not pursue him, lest he kill me (before you kill him)', we do not kill him.</p>
<p class="bas indent1"><span class="nm">(f)</span><span class="cl">Question:</span> What is the source of these laws (other than Rodef, which we learned above)?</p>
<p class="bas indent1"><span class="nm">(g)</span><span class="cl">Answer:</span> "Vela'Na'arah Lo Sa'aseh Davar" - 'Na'arah' is spelled (without a 'Hei') like Na'ar, to teach about someone chasing a man;</p>
<p class="bas indent2"><span class="nm">1.</span>'Na'arah' teaches about a Na'arah Me'orasah;</p>
<p class="bas indent2"><span class="nm">2.</span>'Chet' teaches Arayos of Kares;</p>
<p class="bas indent2"><span class="nm">3.</span>'Maves' teaches Arayos of Misah.</p>
<p class="bas indent1"><span class="nm">(h)</span><span class="cl">Question:</span> Why must the Torah teach all of these?</p>
<p class="bas indent1"><span class="nm">(i)</span><span class="cl">Answer #1:</span> Had it taught only Na'ar, one might have thought that we (kill to) save him because Mishkav Zachar is abnormal (and is a great disgrace), but we do not save a woman;</p>
<p class="bas indent2"><span class="nm">1.</span>Had it taught only Na'arah, one might have thought that we save her from becoming defiled (she loses her virginity, and her husband will despise her), but we do not save a male;</p>
<p class="bas indent2"><span class="nm">2.</span>Had it taught only these two, one might have thought that this is only because (Na'ar) is abnormal or (Na'arah Me'orasah) is greatly defiled, but we do not save other Arayos;</p>
<p class="bas bbbline">73b----------------------------------------73b</p>
<p class="bas indent3"><span class="nm">i.</span>Therefore, 'Chet' is needed to teach other Arayos.</p>
<p class="bas indent2"><span class="nm">3.</span>Had it taught only 'Chet', one might have thought that even Chayavei Lavin are included. Therefore, it says 'Maves.'</p>
<p class="bas indent2"><span class="nm">4.</span>Had it taught only 'Maves', one might have thought that Chayavei Misah are included, but not Chayavei Kerisus. Therefore, it says 'Chet.'</p>
<p class="bas indent1"><span class="nm">(j)</span><span class="cl">Objection::</span> The Torah could have said 'Chet Maves', and it would not need to say 'Na'ar' and 'Na'arah'!</p>
<p class="bas indent1"><span class="nm">(k)</span><span class="cl">Answer #2:</span> Indeed, that would suffice to teach all these cases;</p>
<p class="bas indent2"><span class="nm">1.</span>Rather, 'Na'ar' excludes (one about to serve) idolatry. 'Na'arah' excludes bestiality and Chilul of Shabbos.</p>
<p class="bas indent1"><span class="nm">(l)</span><span class="cl">Question:</span> According to R. Shimon, who says that we do kill someone about to serve idolatry, what do they exclude?</p>
<p class="bas indent1"><span class="nm">(m)</span><span class="cl">Answer:</span> One of them excludes bestiality, and the other excludes Chilul Shabbos;</p>
<p class="bas indent2"><span class="nm">1.</span>One might have thought to include Shabbos, from the Gezeirah Shavah "Chilul-Chilul" from idolatry. 'Na'ar' (or 'Na'arah') teaches that this is not so.</p>
<p class="bas indent1"><span class="nm">(n)</span><span class="cl">Question:</span> According to R. Elazar b'Rebbi Shimon, who says that we kill someone about to serve idolatry or desecrate Shabbos, what do they exclude?</p>
<p class="bas indent1"><span class="nm">(o)</span><span class="cl">Answer:</span> 'Na'ar' excludes bestiality. There is a tradition to pronounce it 'Na'arah' to correspond to the Parshah (which discusses a girl).</p>
<p class="bas subject"><span class="nm">3)</span>KILLING TO PREVENT RAPE</p>
<p class="bas indent1"><span class="nm">(a)</span><span class="cl">(Mishnah - R. Yehudah):</span> Even if she says 'do not pursue him, lest he kill me', we do not kill him.</p>
<p class="bas indent1"><span class="nm">(b)</span><span class="cl">Question:</span> What do they argue about?</p>
<p class="bas indent1"><span class="nm">(c)</span><span class="cl">Answer (Rava):</span> They argue in a case that she does not want to be defiled, but prefers that they not pursue him, lest he kill her:</p>
<p class="bas indent2"><span class="nm">1.</span>Chachamim say that the criterion is the Pegam, and she is concerned for this;</p>
<p class="bas indent2"><span class="nm">2.</span>R. Yehudah says that the Torah allows killing him to save her life (perhaps she will resist and he will kill her). Here, she is not ready to sacrifice her life.</p>
<p class="bas indent1"><span class="nm">(d)</span><span class="cl">Question (Rav Papa):</span> A Kohen Gadol defiles also a widow (he makes her a Chalalah, forbidding her to Terumah and Kohanim), yet we do not kill to save her!</p>
<p class="bas indent1"><span class="nm">(e)</span><span class="cl">Answer (Abaye):</span> The Torah allows killing to save from a big Pegam, but not from a small one.</p>
<p class="bas indent1"><span class="nm">(f)</span><span class="cl">(Beraisa):</span> 'Chet' teaches Arayos of Kares.</p>
<p class="bas indent1"><span class="nm">(g)</span><span class="cl">Contradiction (Mishnah):</span> The fine (for raping or enticing a virgin Na'arah) applies (even) to one who has Bi'ah with his sister. (If he may be killed to save her, he would be exempt from the fine!)</p>
<p class="bas indent1"><span class="nm">(h)</span><span class="cl">Answer #1 (Rabanan):</span> He cannot be killed once he did Ha'ara'ah (the first stage of Bi'ah). The fine is for completing the marital act (which breaks the Besulim).</p>
<p class="bas indent1"><span class="nm">(i)</span><span class="cl">Objection:</span> This is like the opinion that Ha'ara'ah is touching (of the genitals);</p>
<p class="bas indent2"><span class="nm">1.</span>However, like the opinion that it is entrance of the crown (of the Ever), this breaks the Besulim. Liability for the fine comes when he may be killed!</p>
<p class="bas indent1"><span class="nm">(j)</span><span class="cl">Answer #2 (Rav Chisda):</span> The case is, he had abnormal Bi'ah with her (which is Pogem her but does not break the Besulim), and afterwards (when he may no longer be killed) he had normal Bi'ah with her (for which he must pay the fine).</p>
<p class="bas indent1"><span class="nm">(k)</span><span class="cl">Answer #3 (Rava):</span> The case is, she told the onlookers not to kill him. The Mishnah is like R. Yehudah (that he may not be killed in such a case).</p>
<p class="bas indent1"><span class="nm">(l)</span><span class="cl">Answer #4 (Rav Papa):</span> The case is, he enticed her (she consented). All agree that we do not kill him; he must pay the fine.</p>
<p class="bas indent1"><span class="nm">(m)</span><span class="cl">Answer #5 (Abaye):</span> The case is, someone could have saved her without killing him. The Mishnah is like R. Yonason ben Sha'ul.</p>
<p class="bas indent2"><span class="nm">1.</span><span class="cl">(Beraisa - R. Yonason ben Sha'ul):</span> If the Nirdaf or an onlooker could have stopped the Rodef by maiming one of his limbs, but he killed him, he is (Rambam - worthy of being) killed for doing so.</p>
