<p class="bas subject"><span class="nm">1)</span>SAFEK NEFEL</p>
<p class="bas indent1"><span class="nm">(a)</span><span class="cl">(Beraisa - R. Shimon Ben Gamliel):</span> Any child that lives 30 days is viable (even if he was born in the eighth month, we say that he was a seven month baby that came out late) - "U'Fduyav mi'Ben Chodesh Tifdeh";</p>
<p class="bas indent2"><span class="nm">1.</span>Any animal that lives eight days is viable - "Umi'Yom ha'Shemini va'Hal'ah Yeratzeh l'Korban";</p>
<p class="bas indent1"><span class="nm">(b)</span><span class="cl">Inference:</span> Before these times, it is a Safek.</p>
<p class="bas indent1"><span class="nm">(c)</span><span class="cl">Question:</span> How may we circumcise [any child] on Shabbos if he is [always] Safek Nefel?</p>
<p class="bas indent1"><span class="nm">(d)</span><span class="cl">Answer (Rav Ada bar Ahavah):</span> We may circumcise in any case:</p>
<p class="bas indent2"><span class="nm">1.</span>If the baby is viable, Milah overrides Shabbos;</p>
<p class="bas indent2"><span class="nm">2.</span>If it is a Nefel, it is like cutting dead flesh.</p>
<p class="bas indent1"><span class="nm">(e)</span><span class="cl">Question (Beraisa):</span> If we are unsure if a baby is seven or eight months, we do not Mechalel Shabbos.</p>
<p class="bas indent2"><span class="nm">1.</span>We should be allowed to circumcise in any case - either it is a proper Milah, or like cutting dead flesh!</p>
<p class="bas indent1"><span class="nm">(f)</span><span class="cl">Answer (Mar brei d'Ravina and Rav Nechumi):</span> Indeed, he may be circumcised on Shabbos - the Beraisa forbids Machshirei Milah, it is like R. Eliezer [who normally permits them].</p>
<p class="bas indent1"><span class="nm">(g)</span><span class="cl">(Abaye):</span> Tana'im argue about this (whether or not a Nefel is considered dead):</p>
<p class="bas indent2"><span class="nm">1.</span>"V'Chi Yamus Min ha'Behemah Asher Hi Lachem l'Ochlah" - this includes an eight month animal, slaughter does not Metaher it [from Tum'as Nevelah. 'Eight month' refers to a premature birth - really, the full term of pregnancy for small Tahor animals is only five months (Bechoros 8A).]</p>
<p class="bas indent2"><span class="nm">2.</span>R. Yosi b'Rebbi Yehudah and R. Elazar b'Rebbi Shimon say, slaughter is Metaher it.</p>
<p class="bas indent2"><span class="nm">3.</span><span class="cl">Suggestion:</span> Chachamim (the first Tana) consider a Nefel to be alive, R. Yosi and R. Eliezer consider it to be dead.</p>
<p class="bas indent1"><span class="nm">(h)</span><span class="cl">Rejection (Rava):</span> If so, instead of arguing about Tum'ah, they should argue about eating it!</p>
<p class="bas indent2"><span class="nm">1.</span>Rather, all agree that it is dead; R. Yosi and R. Elazar consider it like a Treifah - even though it is dead, slaughter is Metaher it - the same applies to a Nefel;</p>
<p class="bas indent2"><span class="nm">2.</span>Chachamim do not consider it like a Treifah - a Treifah was once fit to live, a Nefel was never fit to live.</p>
<p class="bas indent2"><span class="nm">3.</span><span class="cl">Question:</span> An animal born Treifah was never fit to live [yet slaughter is Metaher it]!</p>
<p class="bas indent2"><span class="nm">4.</span><span class="cl">Answer:</span> Slaughter applies to the category of Treifos, but not to the category of Nefalim.</p>
<p class="bas indent1"><span class="nm">(i)</span><span class="cl">Question #1:</span> Do Chachamim argue with R. Shimon ben Gamliel?</p>
<p class="bas indent1"><span class="nm">(j)</span><span class="cl">Question #2:</span> If you will say that Chachamim argue with him - does the Halachah follow him? (The following two answers are to Question #1, i.e. there is a Tana who is not concerned for a Nefel within eight days, unlike R. Shimon.)</p>
<p class="bas indent1"><span class="nm">(k)</span><span class="cl">Answer #1 (Beraisa):</span> A calf born on Yom Tov may be slaughtered that same day.</p>
<p class="bas indent1"><span class="nm">(l)</span><span class="cl">Rejection:</span> The case is, we know that it had a full term pregnancy.</p>
<p class="bas indent1"><span class="nm">(m)</span><span class="cl">Answer #2 (Beraisa):</span> All agree that if a Bechor was born blemished [on Yom Tov], it is Muchan (it may be slaughtered that day).</p>
<p class="bas indent1"><span class="nm">(n)</span><span class="cl">Rejection:</span> Here also, we know that it had a full term pregnancy.</p>
<p class="bas indent1"><span class="nm">(o)</span><span class="cl">Answer #3 (to both questions):</span> Rav Yehudah taught that the Halachah follows R. Shimon.</p>
<p class="bas indent2"><span class="nm">1.</span>This implies that they argue!</p>
<p class="bas indent1"><span class="nm">(p)</span><span class="cl">(Abaye):</span> If a baby (within 30 days) fell from the roof or was eaten by a lion, all agree that he was [Muchzak to be] alive (most babies are not Nefalim);</p>
<p class="bas indent2"><span class="nm">1.</span>They argue about when he yawned and died [soon after birth, before showing any sign of strength].</p>
<p class="bas indent2"><span class="nm">2.</span><span class="cl">Question:</span> What difference does it make whether or not he was a Nefel?</p>
<p class="bas indent2"><span class="nm">3.</span><span class="cl">Answer:</span> If he was alive (and his father died before him without other descendants), he exempts his mother from Yibum.</p>
<p class="bas indent1"><span class="nm">(q)</span><span class="cl">Objection:</span> They argue about a baby who fell from the roof or was eaten by a lion!</p>
<p class="bas indent2"><span class="nm">1.</span>Rav Papa and Rav Huna brei d'Rav Yehoshua visited Rav Idi bar Avin; he prepared for them a third-born calf (it is healthiest) on its seventh day; they told him, had you waited until evening (its eighth day) to slaughter it, we would have eaten it - since you slaughtered it now, we will not eat it.</p>
<p class="bas indent1"><span class="nm">(r)</span><span class="cl">Correction:</span> Rather, if he yawned and died [soon after birth], all assume that he was a Nefel;</p>
<p class="bas indent2"><span class="nm">1.</span>They argue about a baby (within 30 days) who fell from the roof or was eaten by a lion - R. Shimon assumes that he was a Nefel, Chachamim assume that he was alive.</p>
<p class="bas subject"><span class="nm">2)</span><i>SAFEK NEFEL</i> (cont.)</p>
<p class="bas indent1"><span class="nm">(a)</span>Rav Dimi bar Yosef's son had a son that died within 30 days - the father was mourning over him.</p>
<p class="bas indent1"><span class="nm">(b)</span><span class="cl">Rav Dimi:</span> Do you seek to eat the nice foods brought to mourners?! (We do not mourn over Nefalim!)</p>
<p class="bas indent1"><span class="nm">(c)</span><span class="cl">His son:</span> I know that he was a nine month baby (not a Nefel).</p>
<p class="bas indent1"><span class="nm">(d)</span>Rav Ashi visited the house of Rav Kahana; Rav Kahana's son had died within 30 days, he was mourning over him.</p>
<p class="bas indent1"><span class="nm">(e)</span><span class="cl">Rav Ashi:</span> Rav Yehudah taught that the Halachah follows R. Shimon!</p>
<p class="bas indent1"><span class="nm">(f)</span><span class="cl">Rav Kahana:</span> I know that he was a nine month baby.</p>
<p class="bas indent1"><span class="nm">(g)</span><span class="cl">(Ravina citing Rava):</span> If [a man died leaving only one child, and] the child died within 30 days, and the widow became Mekudeshes (if the baby was a Nefel, Yibum or Chalitzah is required):</p>
<p class="bas bbbline">136b----------------------------------------136b</p>
<p class="bas indent2"><span class="nm">1.</span>If a Yisrael (who may marry a Chalutzah) was Mekadesh her, she does Chalitzah;</p>
<p class="bas indent2"><span class="nm">2.</span>If a Kohen was Mekadesh her, she does not do Chalitzah (Tosfos - regarding Eshes Kohen the Halachah follows Chachamim, we assume that the baby was viable).</p>
<p class="bas indent1"><span class="nm">(h)</span><span class="cl">(Rav Sharbiya citing Rava):</span> In either case, she does Chalitzah.</p>
<p class="bas indent1"><span class="nm">(i)</span><span class="cl">Ravina:</span> Rava said so at night, but the next morning he retracted [and said like I reported]!</p>
<p class="bas indent1"><span class="nm">(j)</span><span class="cl">Rav Sharbiya:</span> If only you would permit Chelev!</p>
<p class="bas subject"><span class="nm">3)</span>ANDROGINUS</p>
<p class="bas indent1"><span class="nm">(a)</span><span class="cl">(Mishnah - R. Yehudah):</span> We may circumcise an Androginus on Shabbos.</p>
<p class="bas indent1"><span class="nm">(b)</span><span class="cl">(Rav Shizbi):</span> R. Yehudah does not consider an Androginus to be male in every respect - if so, he would have an Erech! (If one says 'Erech Ploni Alai', this obligates him to give to Hekdesh a certain amount based on Ploni's age and gender.)</p>
<p class="bas indent1"><span class="nm">(c)</span><span class="cl">Question:</span> How do we know that an Androginus has no Erech?</p>
<p class="bas indent1"><span class="nm">(d)</span><span class="cl">Answer (Beraisa):</span> "[V'Hayah Erkecha] ha'Zachar" - this excludes a Tumtum or Androginus.</p>
<p class="bas indent2"><span class="nm">1.</span><span class="cl">Suggestion:</span> Perhaps this teaches that Erech of a male does not apply to them, rather, Erech Nekevah!</p>
<p class="bas indent2"><span class="nm">2.</span><span class="cl">Rejection:</span> "V'Hayah Erkecha ha'Zachar...v'Im Nekevah Hi" - Erchin applies to a Vadai male or female, not to a Tumtum or Androginus.</p>
<p class="bas indent2"><span class="nm">3.</span>A Stam (anonymous) Sifra (Beraisa that expounds a verse in Vayikra) is R. Yehudah!</p>
<p class="bas indent1"><span class="nm">(e)</span><span class="cl">Support (Rav Nachman bar Yitzchak - Mishnah):</span> Everyone is Kosher to Mekadesh (mix ashes of the Parah Adumah with the water), except for a child, lunatic or deaf person;</p>
<p class="bas indent2"><span class="nm">1.</span>R. Yehudah is Machshir a child, he is Posel a woman and Androginus.</p>
<p class="bas indent2"><span class="nm">2.</span>This shows that he does not consider an Androginus a male for other laws.</p>
<p class="bas indent1"><span class="nm">(f)</span><span class="cl">Question:</span> Why is Milah different?</p>
<p class="bas indent1"><span class="nm">(g)</span><span class="cl">Answer:</span> "Himol Lachem <i>Kol</i> Zachar" includes an Androginus.</p>
