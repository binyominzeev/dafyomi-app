<p class="bas indent1"><span class="nm">(a)</span>(The elders admitted defeat.) R. Yehoshua brought them one by one onto the boat. Each saw a room with 60 chairs, and assumed that all of his colleagues would later join him.</p>
<p class="bas indent1"><span class="nm">(b)</span>R. Yehoshua took earth from Athens. He told the captain to return home. When they came to Bei Bli'i (a place that swallows water or sends it to the depths, in order that the sea will never be full), he filled a flask with its water.</p>
<p class="bas indent1"><span class="nm">(c)</span>He brought the elders in front of the Caesar. Because they were away from their native land, they felt lowly and could not answer him assertively. The Caesar did not believe that these were the elders of Athens. R. Yehoshua put their native earth in front of them and then they spoke brazenly to the Caesar.</p>
<p class="bas indent1"><span class="nm">(d)</span>The Caesar authorized R. Yehoshua to do with them as he wishes. R. Yehoshua put down the Mei Bli'i into a flask (Tosfos - over a pit), and told them that they may leave after they fill the flask with water. They kept pouring in water until their shoulders fell off (they died).</p>
<p class="bas subject"><span class="nm">2)</span>DOUBTFUL PITREI CHAMORIM</p>
<p class="bas indent1"><span class="nm">(a)</span><span class="cl">(Mishnah):</span> If a Mevakeres (an animal giving birth for the first time) gave birth to two male donkeys, the owner gives a Seh to a Kohen. (In this entire Mishnah, one left pregnant female donkey(s) and later found it/them not pregnant, and offspring were born, and no one saw the births.</p>
<p class="bas indent1"><span class="nm">(b)</span>If it gave birth to a male and female, he designates a Seh (to redeem the male, in case it is a Bechor), and he keeps it. (The Kohen cannot prove that it is a Bechor.)</p>
<p class="bas indent1"><span class="nm">(c)</span>If one had two Mevakros, and they gave birth to two males, he gives two Seiyin (plural of Seh) to a Kohen;</p>
<p class="bas indent1"><span class="nm">(d)</span>If they gave birth to a male and female, or to two males and a female, he gives one Seh (perhaps only one is a Bechor. He must designate a second Seh, but he keeps it.)</p>
<p class="bas indent1"><span class="nm">(e)</span>If they gave birth to two females and one or two males, he does not give anything to a Kohen. (Perhaps there is no Bechor. Rashi requires designating two Seiyin. Tosfos requires designating one. Rambam exempts from designation.)</p>
<p class="bas indent1"><span class="nm">(f)</span>If only one mother was Mevakeres, and they gave birth to two males, he gives a Seh to a Kohen;</p>
<p class="bas indent2"><span class="nm">1.</span>If they gave birth to a male and female, he designates a Seh and keeps it.</p>
<p class="bas indent1"><span class="nm">(g)</span>"V'Chol Peter Chamor Tifdeh b'Seh" teaches that a Seh is used to redeem.</p>
<p class="bas indent1"><span class="nm">(h)</span>The Seh can be a sheep or goat, male or female, old or young, Tamim or Ba'al Mum.</p>
<p class="bas indent1"><span class="nm">(i)</span>One may redeem many times with one Seh (Tosfos - in doubtful cases, when one need not give to a Kohen; Rashi - if the Kohen sells or gives the Seh back to him).</p>
<p class="bas indent1"><span class="nm">(j)</span>The Seh is put into the pen for the sake of taking Ma'aser Behemah. If it dies, one may benefit from it.</p>

<p class="bas indent1"><span class="nm">(a)</span><span class="cl">(Gemara) Version #1 - Question:</span> Who is the Tana of the Mishnah?</p>
<p class="bas indent1"><span class="nm">(b)</span><span class="cl">Answer #1 (R. Yirmeyah):</span> It is unlike R. Yosi ha'Gelili, for he says Efshar Letzamtzem (it is possible for things to happen simultaneously; he would require designating (Tosfos; Rashi - giving) two Seiyin when two males are born to one donkey, for perhaps they were born at the same time);</p>
<p class="bas indent1"><span class="nm">(c)</span><span class="cl">Answer #2 (Abaye):</span> It is even like R. Yosi ha'Gelili;</p>
<p class="bas indent2"><span class="nm">1.</span>R. Yosi says that two Tahor Bechoros born at the same time both become Kodesh. He learns from "ha'Zecharim la'Shem" (but this does not apply to Pitrei Chamorim).</p>
<p class="bas indent2"><span class="nm">2.</span><span class="cl">Question:</span> We should learn from there to Pitrei Chamorim!</p>
<p class="bas indent2"><span class="nm">3.</span><span class="cl">Answer:</span> "<i>Ha</i>'Zecharim" excludes other Bechoros.</p>
<p class="bas indent1"><span class="nm">(d)</span><span class="cl">Version #2 - Suggestion:</span> Our Mishnah is unlike R. Yosi ha'Gelili, for he says Efshar Letzamtzem.</p>
<p class="bas indent1"><span class="nm">(e)</span><span class="cl">Rejection (Abaye):</span> It is even like R. Yosi ha'Gelili. The case of Tahor Bechoros born at the same time is different, because it says "ha'Zecharim la'Shem."</p>
<p class="bas indent1"><span class="nm">(f)</span><span class="cl">Objection #1:</span> Granted, according to R. Yirmeyah, the Mishnah (is like Chachamim. It) does not say that they were born at the same time, because this is impossible;</p>
<p class="bas indent2"><span class="nm">1.</span>However, according to Abaye, the Mishnah (is like R. Yosi. It) should teach that even though they were born at the same time, only one need be redeemed (because "ha'Zecharim" does not apply to Pitrei Chamorim)!</p>
<p class="bas indent1"><span class="nm">(g)</span><span class="cl">Objection #2 (Beraisa - R. Yosi ha'Gelili):</span> If a Mevakeres donkey gave birth to two males, and their heads came out at the same time, the owner gives two Seiyin to a Kohen, for it says "ha'Zecharim la'Shem".</p>
<p class="bas indent2"><span class="nm">1.</span><span class="cl">Question:</span> The verse discusses Tahor animals!</p>
<p class="bas indent2"><span class="nm">2.</span><span class="cl">Correction:</span> Rather, the Beraisa should say "<i>because</i> it says 'ha'Zecharim la'Shem'" (and we learn to Pitrei Chamorim).</p>

<p class="bas indent1"><span class="nm">(c)</span><span class="cl">Answer:</span> This is to permit the Peter Chamor.</p>

<p class="bas indent1"><span class="nm">(e)</span><span class="cl">Question:</span> Who is the Tana of the Mishnah?</p>
<p class="bas indent1"><span class="nm">(f)</span><span class="cl">Answer:</span> It is like R. Yehudah;</p>
<p class="bas indent2"><span class="nm">1.</span><span class="cl">(Beraisa - R. Yehudah):</span> One may not benefit from a Peter Chamor (presumably, the correct text attributes this to R. Yehudah. If not, we would call this opinion "Chachamim");</p>

<p class="bas indent1"><span class="nm">(g)</span><span class="cl">Question:</span> What is R. Yehudah's reason?</p>
<p class="bas indent1"><span class="nm">(h)</span><span class="cl">Answer #1 (Ula):</span> We never find something that must be redeemed, yet it is permitted (to benefit from it).</p>
<p class="bas indent1"><span class="nm">(i)</span><span class="cl">Objection:</span> Bechor Adam must be redeemed, but one may benefit from him!</p>
<p class="bas indent1"><span class="nm">(j)</span><span class="cl">Correction:</span> Rather, we never find something that must be redeemed with (something specific, such as) a Seh, yet it is permitted to benefit from it.</p>
<p class="bas indent1"><span class="nm">(k)</span><span class="cl">Question:</span> A Peter Chamor need not be redeemed with a Seh!</p>
<p class="bas indent2"><span class="nm">1.</span>Rav Nechemyah brei d'Rav Yosef redeemed one for cooked herbs of the same value.</p>
<p class="bas indent1"><span class="nm">(l)</span><span class="cl">Answer:</span> We do not discuss redeeming for the value. (Surely, it is not more stringent than Hekdesh, which can be redeemed for its value);</p>
<p class="bas indent2"><span class="nm">1.</span>Rather, we never find something that can be (fully) permitted (for less than its value) only with a Seh, yet one may benefit from it.</p>
<p class="bas indent1"><span class="nm">(m)</span><span class="cl">Question:</span> Ma'aser Sheni can be (fully) permitted only with Kesef Tzuri (minted coins), yet one may benefit from it!</p>
<p class="bas indent2"><span class="nm">1.</span><span class="cl">(Mishnah - R. Yehudah):</span> If Reuven was Mekadesh Leah with Ma'aser Sheni b'Mezid, she is Mekudeshes.</p>
<p class="bas indent1"><span class="nm">(n)</span><span class="cl">Answer:</span> Likewise, if he was Mekadesh her with a Peter Chamor, she is Mekudeshes (even though it is Isurei Hana'ah)!</p>
<p class="bas indent2"><span class="nm">1.</span><span class="cl">(R. Elazar):</span> A woman knows that Ma'aser Sheni is not Mischalel (profaned) through her acceptance. She accepted the Ma'aser with intent to eat it in Yerushalayim;</p>
<p class="bas indent3"><span class="nm">i.</span>Here also, she knows that Peter Chamor is Asur b'Hana'ah. She accepted it intending to redeem it for a Seh. She is Mekudeshes with the excess value of the donkey above the amount she must spend to redeem it.</p>
<p class="bas indent1"><span class="nm">(o)</span><span class="cl">Question:</span> What is R. Shimon's reason?</p>
<p class="bas indent1"><span class="nm">(p)</span><span class="cl">Answer #1 (Ula):</span> We never find something that is forbidden, yet what was used to redeem is permitted.</p>

<p class="bas subject"><span class="nm">5)</span>HOW THE <i>TANA'IM</i> LEARN THE VERSE</p>
<p class="bas indent1"><span class="nm">(a)</span><span class="cl">Answer #2 (to Questions (g) and (o)):</span> R. Yehudah and R. Shimon argue about how to expound a verse:</p>
<p class="bas indent2"><span class="nm">1.</span><span class="cl">(Beraisa - R. Yehudah):</span> "Lo Sa'avod bi'Vechor <i>Shorecha</i>", but you may work with a Bechor in which you are a partner (with a Nochri);</p>
<p class="bas indent2"><span class="nm">2.</span>"V'Lo Sagoz Bechor <i>Tzonecha</i>", but you may shear a Bechor in which you are a partner (with a Nochri);</p>
<p class="bas indent2"><span class="nm">3.</span>R. Shimon says, "Lo Sa'avod bi'Vechor <i>Shorecha</i>", but you may work with Bechor Adam;</p>
<p class="bas indent2"><span class="nm">4.</span>"V'Lo Sagoz Bechor Tzonecha", but you may shear a Peter Chamor.</p>
<p class="bas indent1"><span class="nm">(b)</span><span class="cl">Objection #1:</span> According to R. Shimon, we understand why the entire verse is needed;</p>
<p class="bas indent2"><span class="nm">1.</span>However, according to R. Yehudah, why do we need two clauses (to teach that there is no Kedushah when a Nochri is a partner)?</p>
<p class="bas indent1"><span class="nm">(c)</span><span class="cl">Objection #2:</span> According to R. Yehudah, we have no source to permit working with Bechor Adam!</p>
<p class="bas indent1"><span class="nm">(d)</span><span class="cl">Answer #3:</span> Rather, all agree that "Shorecha" excludes (i.e. permits working with) Bechor Adam. They argue about "Tzonecha":</p>
<p class="bas indent2"><span class="nm">1.</span>R. Yehudah holds that partnership with a Nochri does not exempt from Bechorah. "Tzonecha" teaches that (even though he must give half its value to a Kohen, the Bechor has no Kedushas ha'Guf). One may work with it and shear it;</p>
<p class="bas indent2"><span class="nm">2.</span>R. Shimon holds that partnership with a Nochri exempts from Bechorah. "Tzonecha" need not teach about this case;</p>
<p class="bas indent3"><span class="nm">i.</span>Rather, it teaches about a Peter Chamor (like above).</p>
<p class="bas indent1"><span class="nm">(e)</span><span class="cl">Question:</span> We understand according to R. Yehudah. The Torah needed to say "Tzon<i>echa</i>" to teach about partnership with a Nochri. For parallel structure, it also wrote "Shorecha". (The Torah could have written just "Shor", and still we would have excluded Bechor Adam.)</p>
<p class="bas indent2"><span class="nm">1.</span>However, according to R. Shimon, it would have sufficed to say "Tzon". There is no need to say "Shorecha" nor "Tzonecha"!</p>
<p class="bas indent1"><span class="nm">(f)</span>This is left difficult.</p>
<p class="bas indent1"><span class="nm">(g)</span><span class="cl">(Rava):</span> R. Shimon agrees that Peter Chamor is Asur b'Hana'ah after Arifah. (We amend the text like Rashi, for later Rava explains why he said this. Shitah Mekubetzes attributes both teachings to Rabah, presumably because Abaye challenges it. Usually, Abaye's opinion is brought before Rava's.)</p>
<p class="bas indent1"><span class="nm">(h)</span><span class="cl">Question:</span> What is his reason?</p>
<p class="bas indent1"><span class="nm">(i)</span><span class="cl">Answer:</span> He learns from a Gezerah Shavah "Arifah-Arifah" from Eglah Arufah.</p>
