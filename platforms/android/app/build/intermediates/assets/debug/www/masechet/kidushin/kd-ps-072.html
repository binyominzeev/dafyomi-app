<p class="bas subject"><span class="nm">1)</span>THE BOUNDARIES OF BAVEL</p>
<p class="bas indent1"><span class="nm">(a)</span><span class="cl">Question (Abaye):</span> How far does Bavel extend on the other side of the Pras?</p>
<p class="bas indent1"><span class="nm">(b)</span><span class="cl">Answer (Rav Yosef):</span> Do you ask about Biram? The best lineages of Pumbadisa marry people of Biram!</p>
<p class="bas indent1"><span class="nm">(c)</span><span class="cl">(Rav Papa):</span> The argument about the boundaries of Bavel for lineage is just like the argument for divorce (a Shali'ach to give a Get in Bavel need not testify that it was written and signed in front of him).</p>
<p class="bas indent1"><span class="nm">(d)</span><span class="cl">(Rav Yosef):</span> The argument is only for lineage. For divorce, all agree that that Bavel extends until the second swamp of willows past the bridge.</p>
<p class="bas indent1"><span class="nm">(e)</span><span class="cl">(Rami bar Aba):</span> The epitome of lineage of Bavel is Chavil Yama. Shunya and Guvya are the epitome of lineage of Chavil Yama.</p>
<p class="bas indent1"><span class="nm">(f)</span><span class="cl">(Ravina):</span> Tzitzora is also the epitome.</p>
<p class="bas indent1"><span class="nm">(g)</span><span class="cl">Support (Beraisa - Chanan ben Pinchas):</span> The epitome of lineage of Bavel is Chavil Yama. Shunya, Guvya and Tzitzora are the epitome of Chavil Yama.</p>
<p class="bas indent1"><span class="nm">(h)</span><span class="cl">Objection (Rav Papa):</span> Kusim intermarried with them! (R. Meir disqualified their conversion, and ruled that Kusim are like Nochrim!)</p>
<p class="bas indent1"><span class="nm">(i)</span><span class="cl">Answer:</span> This is wrong. A Kusi requested to marry among them, but they refused.</p>
<p class="bas indent1"><span class="nm">(j)</span><span class="cl">(Abaye):</span> Between the rivers is like Pumbedisa (regarding lineage).</p>
<p class="bas indent1"><span class="nm">(k)</span><span class="cl">(R, Ika bar Avin, citing Rav Chananel):</span> The Nihavand river is like Pumbedisa.</p>
<p class="bas indent2"><span class="nm">1.</span><span class="cl">Abaye:</span> We cannot rely on this. R. Ika is biased, for a girl from there fell to him to Yibum.</p>
<p class="bas indent2"><span class="nm">2.</span><span class="cl">R. Ika:</span> I heard this from Rav Chananel! (Rav Chananel confirmed this.)</p>
<p class="bas indent1"><span class="nm">(l)</span><span class="cl">(R. Aba bar Kahana):</span> "(Sancheriv exiled Yisrael)... they rested in Chalach, Chavor, the Gozan river and the cities of Madai" - Chalach is Chalazon Nihavand.</p>
<p class="bas indent1"><span class="nm">(m)</span><span class="cl">(Shmuel):</span> The cities of Madai are the metropolises of Mushchi, Huski; and Romki.</p>
<p class="bas indent1"><span class="nm">(n)</span><span class="cl">(R. Yochanan):</span> All the places in the verse have bad lineage.</p>
<p class="bas indent1"><span class="nm">(o)</span><span class="cl">Question:</span> R. Chiya bar Avin said in the name of Shmuel that Mushchani is like Pumbedisa!</p>
<p class="bas indent1"><span class="nm">(p)</span><span class="cl">Answer:</span> Mushchi and Mushchani are not the same.</p>
<p class="bas subject"><span class="nm">2)</span>INSIGHTS OF CHACHAMIM</p>
<p class="bas indent1"><span class="nm">(a)</span><span class="cl">(Rav Yosef):</span> "A second animal resembling a bear (in Nevuchadnetzar's dream)" refers to Persians, who resemble bears in their eating, drinking, obesity, hairiness, and restlessness.</p>
<p class="bas indent1"><span class="nm">(b)</span><span class="cl">(Levi):</span> Chachamim of Bavel resemble angels.</p>
<p class="bas indent1"><span class="nm">(c)</span>When Rebbi was dying, he revealed certain cities in Bavel with lineage problems. One was full of converts from Amon (the men may not marry Benos Yisrael). Another was full of Mamzerim. One has brothers who swap wives (which makes Mamzerim);</p>
<p class="bas indent1"><span class="nm">(d)</span>Rebbi said that that very day, residents of a certain city were desecrating Shabbos.</p>
<p class="bas indent2"><span class="nm">1.</span>The ponds were filled with fish, and the people were hunting them.</p>
<p class="bas indent2"><span class="nm">2.</span>R. Acha bar Yoshiyah excommunicated them. They became heretics.</p>
<p class="bas bbbline">72b----------------------------------------72b</p>
<p class="bas indent1"><span class="nm">(e)</span><span class="cl">Rebbi:</span> Rav Ada bar Ahavah (in Bavel) will be circumcised today. (Alternatively, he will die today. This is not the Rav Ada bar Ahavah who lived in the days of the Amora'im.) Rav Yehudah will be born today in Bavel.</p>
<p class="bas indent2"><span class="nm">1.</span>Rebbi was born when R. Akiva died. Rav Yehudah was born when Rebbi died. Rava was born when Rav Yehudah died. Rav Ashi was born when Rava died.</p>
<p class="bas indent2"><span class="nm">2.</span>"The sun shone¸ the sun set" - before a Tzadik dies, a Tzadik like him is born.</p>
<p class="bas indent2"><span class="nm">3.</span>"The lamp of Hash-m did not yet go out; Shmuel was lying..." - Shmuel started to rise before Eli died.</p>
<p class="bas indent1"><span class="nm">(f)</span>"When I prophesized that Platyahu ben Benayah died, I fell on my face and cried" - Rav and Shmuel argued about whether Yechezkel considered him to be a Tzadik or Rasha.</p>
<p class="bas indent2"><span class="nm">1.</span>One opinion holds that was a Tzadik. Nevuchadnetzar used to send some of his captives to his father-in-law in Meishan. The latter complained that he never received Yisre'elim.</p>
<p class="bas indent3"><span class="nm">i.</span><span class="cl">Platyahu (to Nevuchadnetzar):</span> We are distinguished, we should stay to serve you! You can send slaves to your father-in-law.</p>
<p class="bas indent3"><span class="nm">ii.</span>(This was good for Yisrael, lest Yisrael be slaves to slaves (of Nevuchadnetzar).) Yechezkel regretted that Platyahu died so young.</p>
<p class="bas indent2"><span class="nm">2.</span>One opinion holds that he was a Rasha. It says "at the gate (of the Mikdash)... 25 men, among them... Platyahu", and it says "twenty-five men, their backs to the Heichal, they were facing east".</p>
<p class="bas indent3"><span class="nm">i.</span><span class="cl">Question:</span> If they were facing east, we know that their backs were (to the Heichal) to the west!</p>
<p class="bas indent3"><span class="nm">ii.</span><span class="cl">Answer:</span> The verse teaches that they exposed themselves and excreted in front of Hash-m.</p>
<p class="bas indent3"><span class="nm">iii.</span>Yechezkel regretted that such a Rasha died peacefully on his bed.</p>
<p class="bas indent1"><span class="nm">(g)</span><span class="cl">Suggestion:</span> Shmuel must hold that he was a Rasha (for he holds that there are no slaves in Meishan)!</p>
<p class="bas indent2"><span class="nm">1.</span><span class="cl">(R. Chiya bar Avin citing Shmuel):</span> Mushchani is like Pumbedisa. There is no concern lest people of Meishan are slaves or Mamzerim. The only concern is for Kohanim who married divorcees (their children are Chalalim).</p>
<p class="bas indent1"><span class="nm">(h)</span><span class="cl">Rejection:</span> Really, Shmuel can hold he was a Tzadik!</p>
<p class="bas indent2"><span class="nm">1.</span><span class="cl">Question (Shmuel):</span> Does "any slave of a man" exclude the slave of a woman?!</p>
<p class="bas indent2"><span class="nm">2.</span><span class="cl">Answer (Shmuel):</span> Rather, it teaches that only a slave with a master over him is considered a slave. If a master makes his slave Hefker, the slave is free and does not need a Get of freedom. (Surely the masters of the slaves sent to Meishan despaired, so the slaves became free. Therefore, there is no concern lest people of Meishan are slaves.)</p>
<p class="bas indent1"><span class="nm">(i)</span><span class="cl">(Rav Yehudah citing Shmuel):</span> Only R. Meir holds that all lands are like dough compared to Eretz Yisrael, and Eretz Yisrael is like dough compared to Bavel. Chachamim hold that all lands have a Chazakah of good lineage.</p>
<p class="bas indent1"><span class="nm">(j)</span>Ameimar allowed Rav Huna bar Nasan to marry a girl from Mechuzaisa (a city outside of Bavel).</p>
<p class="bas indent2"><span class="nm">1.</span><span class="cl">Rav Ashi:</span> Do you rely on Rav Yehudah's teaching? Rav Kahana, Rav Papa and Rav Zevid said differently (in the name of Shmuel)!</p>
<p class="bas indent2"><span class="nm">2.</span>Ameimar did not retract, for he heard from Rav Zevid of Neharda'a (like Rav Yehudah reported).</p>
<p class="bas subject"><span class="nm">3)</span>HETERIM FOR MAMZERIM</p>
<p class="bas indent1"><span class="nm">(a)</span><span class="cl">(Beraisa - Rebbi Yosi):</span> In the future, Mamzerim and Nesinim will be permitted;</p>
<p class="bas indent1"><span class="nm">(b)</span>R. Meir says, they will not.</p>
<p class="bas indent2"><span class="nm">1.</span><span class="cl">Rebbi Yosi:</span> It says "I will throw Tahor water on you, and you will become Tehorim!"</p>
<p class="bas indent2"><span class="nm">2.</span><span class="cl">R. Meir:</span> That refers to Taharah from Tum'ah and abominations, not from Mamzerus.</p>
<p class="bas indent2"><span class="nm">3.</span><span class="cl">Rebbi Yosi:</span> "I will be Metaher you" includes even from Mamzerus.</p>
<p class="bas indent1"><span class="nm">(c)</span><span class="cl">Question:</span> According to R. Meir, we understand "a Mamzer will dwell in Ashdod";</p>
<p class="bas indent2"><span class="nm">1.</span>This refutes Rebbi Yosi!</p>
<p class="bas indent1"><span class="nm">(d)</span><span class="cl">Answer:</span> He explains like Rav Yosef translates the verse, Beis Yisrael will dwell in the land, from which they were estranged like a Mamzer until now.</p>
<p class="bas indent1"><span class="nm">(e)</span><span class="cl">(Rav Yehudah):</span> The Halachah follows Rebbi Yosi.</p>
<p class="bas indent1"><span class="nm">(f)</span><span class="cl">(Rav Yosef):</span> Had Rav Yehudah not ruled like Rebbi Yosi, Eliyahu (in the future) would have separated many groups (of Mamzerim) from Yisrael.</p>
<p class="bas indent1"><span class="nm">(g)</span><span class="cl">(Beraisa - Rebbi Yosi):</span> A convert may marry a Mamzeres;</p>
<p class="bas indent1"><span class="nm">(h)</span>Rebbi Yehudah says, he may not.</p>
<p class="bas indent1"><span class="nm">(i)</span>Converts, freed slaves and Chalalim may all marry a Bas Kohen.</p>
