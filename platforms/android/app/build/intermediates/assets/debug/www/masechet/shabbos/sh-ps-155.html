<p class="bas indent1"><span class="nm">(a)</span><span class="cl">(Rava):</span> The opinion that forbids Tzedadim also forbids Tzidei Tzedadim; the opinion that permits Tzidei Tzedadim also permits Tzedadim.</p>
<p class="bas indent1"><span class="nm">(b)</span><span class="cl">Question (Rav Mesharshiya - Beraisa):</span> If a peg was inserted into a tree and one hung a basket (four by four Tefachim wide) above 10 Tefachim [and put food inside for an Eiruv], the Eiruv is Pasul (it is in Reshus ha'Yachid, the person is in Reshus ha'Yachid, he may not take it Bein ha'Shemashos);</p>
<p class="bas indent2"><span class="nm">1.</span>If it is below 10, the Eiruv is Kosher.</p>
<p class="bas indent2"><span class="nm">2.</span><span class="cl">Inference:</span> Below 10 it is Kosher because the basket rests on a peg in the tree - if it hung on the tree itself, it would be Pasul in any case!</p>
<p class="bas indent2"><span class="nm">3.</span><span class="cl">Summation of question:</span> The Tana forbids Tzedadim (on the tree itself) and permits Tzidei Tzedadim (on a peg in the tree)!</p>
<p class="bas indent1"><span class="nm">(c)</span><span class="cl">Answer (Rav Papa):</span> The case is, the basket has a narrow opening - if it would be attached to the tree itself, he could not remove the food without moving the tree.</p>
<p class="bas indent1"><span class="nm">(d)</span>The Halachah is, Tzedadim are forbidden, and Tzidei Tzedadim are permitted.</p>
<p class="bas indent1"><span class="nm">(e)</span><span class="cl">(Rav Ashi):</span> Since Tzedadim are forbidden, one may not rest a ladder against a date tree [and go up] - rather, he should insert a peg, and rest the ladder against it;</p>
<p class="bas indent2"><span class="nm">1.</span>When going up, one may not step on the peg, only on rungs of the ladder.</p>

<p class="bas indent2"><span class="nm">2.</span>If the first Tana forbids Tirchah and permits Shivuy Ochel, we understand this - R. Yehudah comes to say that cutting carobs for a small animal is also Shivuy Ochel [and is permitted].</p>

<p class="bas indent1"><span class="nm">(m)</span><span class="cl">Answer:</span> R. Yehudah permits for a 'Dakah' - this does not mean a small animal, rather, a big animal;</p>
<p class="bas indent2"><span class="nm">1.</span>He calls it Dakah because it is Daika (fussy) about what it eats.</p>
<p class="bas indent2"><span class="nm">2.</span><span class="cl">Objection:</span> The Reisha says 'for a Gasah or Dakah', there 'Dakah' means the opposite of big - surely also R. Yehudah uses it to refer to a small animal!</p>
