<p class="bas subject"><span class="nm">1)</span>WHEN MAY WE BE <i>TOLEH</i> THAT THERE IS NO <i>TUM'AH</i>?</p>
<p class="bas indent1"><span class="nm">(a)</span><span class="cl">(Mishnah):</span> If three women slept in a bed and blood was found under the middle woman, all of them are Teme'os (one of the long sides of the bed is against a wall);</p>
<p class="bas indent1"><span class="nm">(b)</span>If blood was found under the woman on the inside, she and the middle woman are Teme'os, and the outer woman is Tehorah;</p>
<p class="bas indent1"><span class="nm">(c)</span>If blood was found under the outer woman, she and the middle woman are Teme'os. the inner woman is Tehorah;</p>
<p class="bas indent2"><span class="nm">1.</span>This is if they entered the bed from its foot. If they entered from the outside, all are Teme'os (for everyone passed over the place of blood).</p>
<p class="bas indent1"><span class="nm">(d)</span>If one of them checked (Ra'avad - within Shi'ur Veses after finding the blood; Ba'al ha'Ma'or - even after this) and found that she is Tehorah, she is Tehorah, and the others are Teme'os;</p>
<p class="bas indent1"><span class="nm">(e)</span>If two of them checked and found themselves Tehoros, they are Tehoros, and the third is Teme'ah;</p>
<p class="bas indent1"><span class="nm">(f)</span>If all of them checked and found themselves Tehoros, all are Teme'os.</p>
<p class="bas indent1"><span class="nm">(g)</span>R. Meir says, this is like a heap containing Tum'as Mes that became confused with two Tahor heaps. If one of them was checked and found to be Tahor, it is Tahor, and the others are Teme'im;</p>
<p class="bas indent2"><span class="nm">1.</span>If two of them were checked and found to be Tehorim, they are Tehorim, and the third is Tamei;</p>
<p class="bas indent2"><span class="nm">2.</span>If all of them were checked and found to be Tehorim, all of them are Teme'im.</p>
<p class="bas indent1"><span class="nm">(h)</span>R. Meir says, anything Muchzak to be Tamei keeps its Chazakah until we know where the Tum'ah went;</p>
<p class="bas indent1"><span class="nm">(i)</span>Chachamim say, one digs until finding a big rock or virgin soil. (We are not concerned for Tum'ah underneath.)</p>
<p class="bas indent1"><span class="nm">(j)</span><span class="cl">(Gemara) Question:</span> Why does our Mishnah distinguish under which woman the Tum'ah was found, but the previous Mishnah did not?</p>
<p class="bas indent1"><span class="nm">(k)</span><span class="cl">Version #1 (most Mefarshim) Answer (R. Ami):</span> In the previous Mishnah, the women overlapped. (Therefore, we are concerned no matter where the blood was found. In our Mishnah, they were separated.)</p>
<p class="bas indent1"><span class="nm">(l)</span><span class="cl">Version #2 (Eliyahu Rabah) Answer (R. Ami):</span> In our Mishnah, the women were on the bed at the same time. (In the previous Mishnah, they were on it one after the other. No woman was on the inside or outside. The previous Mishnah discusses only one woman checking herself, for only the last woman (who found the Kesem) was able to check within Shi'ur Veses.) (end of Version #2)</p>
<p class="bas indent1"><span class="nm">(m)</span><span class="cl">(Mishnah):</span> If one of them checked... (R. Meir says, this is like a heap...)</p>
<p class="bas indent1"><span class="nm">(n)</span><span class="cl">Question:</span> Why does the Mishnah give a parable?</p>
<p class="bas indent1"><span class="nm">(o)</span><span class="cl">Answer:</span> R. Meir asks Chachamim 'why do you agree with me concerning blood, and argue with me about a heap?'</p>
<p class="bas indent2"><span class="nm">1.</span>Chachamim hold that we can be Metaher all the heaps, for perhaps a raven removed the Tum'ah. We cannot be Metaher all the women, for the blood came from one of them!</p>
<p class="bas indent1"><span class="nm">(p)</span><span class="cl">(Beraisa - R. Meir):</span> A case occurred in which Tum'ah was Muchzak near a certain tree. People checked and did not find it. In the end, a wind uprooted the tree, and a skull was found inserted in its trunk!</p>
<p class="bas indent1"><span class="nm">(q)</span><span class="cl">Chachamim:</span> That was because they had not checked very well.</p>
<p class="bas indent1"><span class="nm">(r)</span><span class="cl">(Beraisa - R. Yosi):</span> A case occurred in which Tum'ah was Muchzak in a certain cave. They checked until reaching virgin soil as smooth as a fingernail, and did not find it. Once, workers entered to escape the rain. They found a hollow (shaped like a mortar) full of bones.</p>
<p class="bas indent1"><span class="nm">(s)</span><span class="cl">Chachamim:</span> That was because they had not checked very well.</p>
<p class="bas indent1"><span class="nm">(t)</span><span class="cl">(Beraisa - Aba Sha'ul):</span> A case occurred in which Tum'ah was Muchzak in a certain area. It was too big to check. R. Yehoshua took sheets, soaked them in water, and spread them over the area. The ground was wet in the place of the Tum'ah (the earth had been dug up. It was softer, so it absorbed the water) and dry elsewhere. (Alternatively, the sheet was dry in the place of Taharah and wet elsewhere.)</p>
<p class="bas subject"><span class="nm">2)</span>BEING CONCERNED FOR <i>LASHON HA'RA</i></p>
<p class="bas indent1"><span class="nm">(a)</span><span class="cl">(Beraisa):</span> This episode was in the pit that Yishmael ben Nesanyah filled with corpses -- "veha'Bor Asher Hishlich Sham Yishmael... Anashim Asher Hikah b'Yad Gedalyah";</p>
<p class="bas indent2"><span class="nm">1.</span><span class="cl">Question:</span> Gedalyah did not kill them. Yishmael killed them!</p>
<p class="bas indent2"><span class="nm">2.</span><span class="cl">Answer:</span> Because Gedalyah should have been concerned for the words of Yochanan ben Korach (that Yishmael seeks to kill Gedalyah), and he did not, the verse attributes to him as if he killed the people.</p>
<p class="bas indent1"><span class="nm">(b)</span><span class="cl">(Rava):</span> Even though one may not accept (believe) Lashon ha'Ra, he should be concerned lest it is true.</p>
<p class="bas indent1"><span class="nm">(c)</span>There were rumors that some Galileans had killed someone. They asked R. Tarfon to hide them.</p>
<p class="bas indent1"><span class="nm">(d)</span><span class="cl">R. Tarfon:</span> If I will not hide you, perhaps you will be found (and executed);</p>
<p class="bas indent2"><span class="nm">1.</span>I cannot hide you. Chachamim taught that one must be concerned for Lashon ha'Ra. (Tosfos - if you really killed, the kingdom will want to kill me for hiding you)!</p>
<p class="bas indent2"><span class="nm">2.</span>Go hide yourselves!</p>
<p class="bas indent1"><span class="nm">(e)</span><span class="cl">Question:</span> "Va'Yomer Hash-m El Moshe Al Tira" (implies that Moshe feared Og). Why did he fear Ogeres (even after he killed Sichon), but he did not fear Sichon?</p>
<p class="bas indent2"><span class="nm">1.</span>It was taught that Sichon and Og were (brothers,) the sons of Achiyah bar Shemchazai (an angel).</p>
<p class="bas indent1"><span class="nm">(f)</span><span class="cl">Answer (R. Yochanan):</span> He feared that the merit of (what Og did for) Avraham would help Og. "Va'Yavo <i>ha'Palit</i> va'Yaged l'Avram" refers to Og, who remained from the generation of the flood.</p>
<p class="bas subject"><span class="nm">3)</span>A <i>KESEM</i> LOST IN A GARMENT</p>
<p class="bas indent1"><span class="nm">(a)</span><span class="cl">(Beraisa):</span> If a Kesem was lost in a garment (and we want to be Metaher the garment), we wash it with seven ingredients to be Mevatel (nullify) it;</p>
<p class="bas indent1"><span class="nm">(b)</span>R. Shimon ben Elazar says, one checks a small area at a time.</p>
<p class="bas bbbline">61b----------------------------------------61b</p>
<p class="bas indent1"><span class="nm">(c)</span>If semen was lost in a new garment (Rashi; Me'iri - the semen came recently), we check it with a needle. (The place of absorbed semen is hard. The needle is slow to penetrate there);</p>
<p class="bas indent1"><span class="nm">(d)</span>If semen was lost in an old garment (Rashi; Me'iri - the semen is old), we check it in the sun. (The place of semen is more opaque.)</p>
<p class="bas indent1"><span class="nm">(e)</span><span class="cl">(Beraisa):</span> The small area (that one may check at a time) is no less than three (by three) fingers.</p>
<p class="bas indent1"><span class="nm">(f)</span><span class="cl">(Beraisa):</span> If Sha'atnez was lost in a garment, one may not sell it to a Nochri (lest he resell it to a Yisrael) nor make it into a saddle, but one may use it for shrouds.</p>
<p class="bas indent1"><span class="nm">(g)</span><span class="cl">Inference (Rav Yosef):</span> (We are not concerned that the Mes will be wearing Kil'ayim when he is revived.) This shows that the Mitzvos will cease!</p>
<p class="bas indent1"><span class="nm">(h)</span><span class="cl">Question (Abaye):</span> R. Yanai taught that we may dress the Mes in such shrouds at the time of eulogies, but we may not use them for burial!</p>
<p class="bas indent1"><span class="nm">(i)</span><span class="cl">Answer (Rav Yosef):</span> R. Yochanan permits them even for burial. This is as he expounds:</p>
<p class="bas indent2"><span class="nm">1.</span><span class="cl">(R. Yochanan):</span> "Ba'Mesim Chofshi" teaches that once someone dies, he is (permanently) exempt from Mitzvos.</p>
<p class="bas indent1"><span class="nm">(j)</span><span class="cl">(Rafram bar Papa citing Rav Chisda):</span> If Sha'atnez was lost in a garment, one dyes it and it is permitted.</p>
<p class="bas indent1"><span class="nm">(k)</span><span class="cl">Question (Rava):</span> What is his source for this?</p>
<p class="bas indent1"><span class="nm">(l)</span><span class="cl">Answer (Rafram - Mishnah - Chachamim):</span> One digs until he finds a big rock...</p>
<p class="bas indent2"><span class="nm">1.</span>If Tum'ah is not found, we assume that ravens took it. Likewise, (if the dye is absorbed uniformly) we know that the Kil'ayim fell out, for wool and linen do not absorb dye equally!</p>
<p class="bas indent1"><span class="nm">(m)</span><span class="cl">(Mar Zutra):</span> If one sewed a linen thread into a wool garment, pulled it out and is unsure whether or not (all of) it came out, it is permitted.</p>
<p class="bas indent1"><span class="nm">(n)</span><span class="cl">Question:</span> What is the reason?</p>
<p class="bas indent1"><span class="nm">(o)</span><span class="cl">Version #1 (Tosfos) Answer:</span> "Sha'atnez" teaches that the Torah forbids only (if the wool and linen were each) Shu'a (combed), Tavi (spun) and Nuz (twined, and then they were connected. Mar Zutra discusses a linen thread that was not twined);</p>
<p class="bas indent2"><span class="nm">1.</span>Chachamim forbid (even if it was not twined) if a thread is Vadai there. They did not forbid a Safek.</p>
<p class="bas indent1"><span class="nm">(p)</span><span class="cl">Version #2 (Rashi) Answer:</span> "Sha'atnez" teaches that the Torah forbids only (if the wool and linen were <i>together</i>) Shu'a (combed), Tavi (spun) and Nuz (woven); (end of Version #2)</p>
<p class="bas indent2"><span class="nm">1.</span>Chachamim forbid if a thread is Vadai there, even though the wool and linen are only woven together. They did not forbid a Safek.</p>
<p class="bas indent1"><span class="nm">(q)</span><span class="cl">Question (Rav Ashi):</span> Perhaps the Torah forbids even if the wool and linen were (Rashi - together) Shu'a, Tavi <i>or</i> Noz!</p>
<p class="bas indent1"><span class="nm">(r)</span><span class="cl">Answer:</span> The Torah taught all of these in one word, to teach that all are required.</p>
<p class="bas indent1"><span class="nm">(s)</span>The Halachah follows Mar Zutra.</p>
<p class="bas subject"><span class="nm">4)</span><i>KESAMIM</i> ON COLORED GARMENTS</p>
<p class="bas indent1"><span class="nm">(a)</span><span class="cl">(Beraisa):</span> Tum'as Kesamim applies to colored garments;</p>
<p class="bas indent1"><span class="nm">(b)</span>R. Nasan bar Yosef says, it does not. The enactment to wear colored garments was in order to be lenient about Kesamim!</p>
<p class="bas indent1"><span class="nm">(c)</span><span class="cl">Objection:</span> There was no enactment to wear colored garments!</p>
<p class="bas indent1"><span class="nm">(d)</span><span class="cl">Correction:</span> Rather, the Heter (allowance) to wear colored garments was in order to be lenient about Kesamim.</p>
<p class="bas indent1"><span class="nm">(e)</span><span class="cl">Inference:</span> It would be forbidden to wear colored garments if not for Kesamim!</p>
<p class="bas indent1"><span class="nm">(f)</span><span class="cl">Affirmation:</span> Yes!</p>
<p class="bas indent2"><span class="nm">1.</span><span class="cl">(Mishnah):</span> During Vespasian's siege of Yerushalayim (before the second Churban), Chachamim decreed against crowns of Chasanim and bells with one surface (on which the clapper bangs);</p>
<p class="bas indent2"><span class="nm">2.</span>Chachamim considered forbidding colored garments. They decided that it is better to allow them, to be lenient about Kesamim.</p>
