<p class="bas subject"><span class="nm">1)</span>NOCHRIM EXEMPT FROM KEDUSHAS BECHOR</p>
<p class="bas indent1"><span class="nm">(a)</span><span class="cl">(Mishnah):</span> (Normally, one must redeem a Peter Chamor (a firstborn donkey, by giving its value or a Seh (goat or sheep) to a Kohen). If not, he must do Arifah (break its neck).) In the following cases, a Peter Chamor is exempt (from redemption or Arifah):</p>
<p class="bas indent2"><span class="nm">1.</span>One bought the fetus in a Nochri's donkey;</p>
<p class="bas indent2"><span class="nm">2.</span>One sold the fetus in his donkey to a Nochri, even though this is forbidden;</p>
<p class="bas indent2"><span class="nm">3.</span>One was a partner with a Nochri in a donkey;</p>
<p class="bas indent2"><span class="nm">4.</span>One was Mekabel from a Nochri (to take care of his donkey, and share the offspring), or he gave his donkey to a Nochri b'Kabalah.</p>
<p class="bas indent1"><span class="nm">(b)</span>We learn from "b'Yisrael" -- not of others.</p>
<p class="bas indent1"><span class="nm">(c)</span><span class="cl">(Gemara) Question:</span> Why must the Mishnah teach all of these cases?</p>
<p class="bas indent1"><span class="nm">(d)</span><span class="cl">Answer:</span> All are needed;</p>
<p class="bas indent2"><span class="nm">1.</span>Had it only taught only about one who bought a fetus, we would think that then it is exempt, for he (did not transgress, he even) increased its Kedushah (Tosfos -- if the fetus is a female, Kedushas Bechor will apply to its offspring), but one who sold his fetus is fined (he must buy it back to redeem it), for he uprooted Kedushas Bechor from it;</p>
<p class="bas indent2"><span class="nm">2.</span><span class="cl">Question:</span> Why must it teach about one who was a partner with a Nochri?</p>
<p class="bas indent2"><span class="nm">3.</span><span class="cl">Answer:</span> Chachamim teach unlike R. Yehudah, who says that Kedushas Bechor applies in this case.</p>
<p class="bas indent2"><span class="nm">4.</span><span class="cl">Question:</span> Why must it teach about one who was Mekabel from a Nochri?</p>
<p class="bas indent2"><span class="nm">5.</span><span class="cl">Answer:</span> This is for parallel structure with the last case, in which a Nochri was Mekabel one's donkey.</p>
<p class="bas indent2"><span class="nm">6.</span><span class="cl">Question:</span> Why must it teach about giving to a Nochri b'Kabalah?</p>
<p class="bas indent2"><span class="nm">7.</span><span class="cl">Answer:</span> One might have thought that since the mother primarily belongs to the Yisrael, we fine him (to buy it back to redeem it), lest this be confused with a regular case (in which the Yisrael owns everything).</p>
<p class="bas subject"><span class="nm">2)</span>SELLING A FETUS TO A <i>NOCHRI</i></p>
<p class="bas indent1"><span class="nm">(a)</span>(In all places a Yisrael is forbidden to sell a large (i.e. work) animal to Nochrim. This is a decree, lest he sell just before Shabbos and (on Shabbos) show the Nochri how to call to it to make it go, (and transgress making an animal work on Shabbos), or lest he rent to Nochrim. (A Yisrael is commanded that his animals rest on Shabbos). In some places, the custom is to permit selling small animals to Nochrim. In other places, it is forbidden.)</p>
<p class="bas indent1"><span class="nm">(b)</span><span class="cl">Version #1 (Mishnah - R. Yehudah):</span> It is permitted to sell a Shevurah (lame animal) to Nochrim;</p>
<p class="bas indent1"><span class="nm">(c)</span>Ben Beseira permits selling a horse.</p>
<p class="bas indent1"><span class="nm">(d)</span><span class="cl">Question:</span> Does R. Yehudah permit selling a fetus to a Nochri?</p>
<p class="bas indent2"><span class="nm">1.</span>Perhaps he permits a Shevurah because it cannot work. The same applies to a fetus!</p>
<p class="bas indent2"><span class="nm">2.</span>Or, perhaps he permits a Shevurah because it is unusual (and people will not come to sell a Bari (healthy animal).) If so, one may not sell a fetus (for it is normal).</p>
<p class="bas indent1"><span class="nm">(e)</span><span class="cl">Answer #1 (Mishnah):</span> ... If one sold the fetus in his donkey to a Nochri, even though this is forbidden;</p>
<p class="bas indent2"><span class="nm">1.</span>R. Yehudah does not argue!</p>
<p class="bas indent1"><span class="nm">(f)</span><span class="cl">Objection:</span> If so, you should also infer that he does not argue about partnership, Kabalah from a Nochri or giving to a Nochri b'Kabalah!</p>
<p class="bas indent2"><span class="nm">1.</span>We know that he argues (at least about partnership). Likewise, he can argue about selling a fetus.</p>
<p class="bas indent1"><span class="nm">(g)</span><span class="cl">Answer #2 (Beraisa - R. Yehudah):</span> If Reuven was Mekabel from a Nochri and it gave birth, we estimate its value. He gives half of this to a Kohen;</p>
<p class="bas indent2"><span class="nm">1.</span>If he gave to a Nochri b'Kabalah, even though this is forbidden, he is fined (and must buy it back for up to) 10 times its value, he gives its full value to a Kohen.</p>
<p class="bas bbbline">2b----------------------------------------2b</p>
<p class="bas indent2"><span class="nm">2.</span><span class="cl">Suggestion:</span> R. Yehudah discusses giving a fetus to a Nochri b'Kabalah. (The Mekabel has no stake in the mother).</p>
<p class="bas indent1"><span class="nm">(h)</span><span class="cl">Rejection #1:</span> No, he discusses giving a female (not pregnant) b'Kabalah for its offspring.</p>
<p class="bas indent2"><span class="nm">1.</span><span class="cl">Question:</span> It says "Damav" (the masculine form for "its value.") Surely he discusses giving a fetus!</p>
<p class="bas indent2"><span class="nm">2.</span><span class="cl">Answer:</span> It should say "Dameha" (the feminine form).</p>
<p class="bas indent2"><span class="nm">3.</span><span class="cl">Objection:</span> If the mother was given (and Reuven must buy it back), why is it given to Kohanim?!</p>
<p class="bas indent1"><span class="nm">(i)</span><span class="cl">Rejection #2:</span> Rather, he gave a pregnant female to a Nochri to fatten it (the Nochri gets half of the increased value and offspring);</p>
<p class="bas indent2"><span class="nm">1.</span>Since we fine him regarding the mother (he must buy it back), we also fine him regarding the fetus. (He must give its full value to a Kohen, lest he benefit from uprooting Kedushas Bechor.)</p>
<p class="bas indent1"><span class="nm">(j)</span><span class="cl">Answer #2 (Rav Ashi - Beraisa - R. Yehudah):</span> One may sell a Shevurah, because it cannot heal.</p>
<p class="bas indent2"><span class="nm">1.</span><span class="cl">Inference:</span> If it could heal, it would be forbidden.</p>
<p class="bas indent2"><span class="nm">2.</span>A fetus is like a Shevurah that can heal! (After it is born and grows, it can work.)</p>

<p class="bas indent1"><span class="nm">(m)</span><span class="cl">Rejection:</span> It can even be like R. Yehudah. He permits a Shevurah because it is unusual, but it is normal to sell a fetus, so it is forbidden.</p>

<p class="bas indent2"><span class="nm">4.</span><span class="cl">Answer:</span> The case is, he gave a pregnant female to a Nochri to fatten it. Since we fine him regarding the mother, we fine him regarding the fetus.</p>

<p class="bas subject"><span class="nm">3)</span>AN ANIMAL SOLD FOR ITS OFFSPRING</p>
<p class="bas indent1"><span class="nm">(a)</span>(If one sold a large animal (i.e. a species that works) to a Nochri, he is fined. He must buy it back for up to 10 times its value.)</p>
<p class="bas indent1"><span class="nm">(b)</span><span class="cl">Question:</span> If one sold a female to a Nochri just for (R. Gershom - half of) its future offspring (it is not pregnant now), what is the law?</p>
<p class="bas indent2"><span class="nm">1.</span>We ask according to R. Yehudah and according to Chachamim.</p>
<p class="bas indent2"><span class="nm">2.</span>R. Yehudah permits selling a Shevurah, for (this is unusual, so) people will not confuse this with (and come to sell) a Bari. Here people might confuse this (a sale for offspring) with a full sale, so he should be fined;</p>
<p class="bas indent3"><span class="nm">i.</span>Or, since R. Yehudah permits selling a Shevurah absolutely, all the more so here, when he retains some ownership!</p>
<p class="bas indent2"><span class="nm">3.</span>Chachamim forbid selling a Shevurah absolutely. They would permit here, for he retains some ownership;</p>
<p class="bas indent3"><span class="nm">i.</span>Or, since they forbid selling a Shevurah, even though people are not likely to get confused, all the more so they forbid here (like a full sale, and fine)!</p>
<p class="bas indent2"><span class="nm">4.</span><span class="cl">Question:</span> Do Chachamim really forbid because of confusion?!</p>
<p class="bas indent3"><span class="nm">i.</span><span class="cl">(Beraisa):</span> Chachamim asked R. Yehudah "(why do you permit a female Shevurah?) The Nochri will leave it to mate and have offspring!"</p>
<p class="bas indent3"><span class="nm">ii.</span>This shows that they forbid (and fine) because (he will leave it for the sake) of offspring (but not because of confusion)!</p>
<p class="bas indent2"><span class="nm">5.</span><span class="cl">Answer:</span> They address R. Yehudah according to his reasoning;</p>
<p class="bas indent3"><span class="nm">i.</span>We forbid due to confusion. Why do you permit?</p>
<p class="bas indent3"><span class="nm">ii.</span>Presumably, since it cannot be healed, you consider it as if he bought it to eat immediately. Perhaps he wants it for offspring, and he will keep it for a long time!</p>
<p class="bas indent2"><span class="nm">6.</span>R. Yehudah answered that it will not gave birth, for it will not allow a male to mate with it. (R. Gershom - it cannot bear a male's weight).</p>
<p class="bas indent1"><span class="nm">(c)</span>Answer #1 (Mishnah):... If one gave his donkey to a Nochri b'Kabalah.</p>
<p class="bas indent2"><span class="nm">1.</span>It does not say "even though this is forbidden"!</p>
<p class="bas indent1"><span class="nm">(d)</span><span class="cl">Objection:</span> Also regarding partnership with a Nochri, it does not say "even though this is forbidden." Will you infer that it is permitted?!</p>
<p class="bas indent2"><span class="nm">1.</span><span class="cl">(Shmuel's father):</span> One may not make a partnership with a Nochri, lest the Nochri need to swear, and he will swear in the name of idolatry, and the Yisrael transgresses "Lo Yishma Al Picha."</p>
<p class="bas indent2"><span class="nm">2.</span>We must say that Mishnah forbids selling (a fetus), and the same applies to partnership;</p>
<p class="bas indent2"><span class="nm">3.</span>Likewise, it forbids selling, and the same applies to giving b'Kabalah!</p>
<p class="bas indent2"><span class="nm">4.</span><span class="cl">Question:</span> Why does it mention the Isur to sell, and not the Isurim of partnership or giving b'Kabalah?</p>
<p class="bas indent2"><span class="nm">5.</span><span class="cl">Answer:</span> This is the main (Tosfos - most evident) prohibition.</p>
<p class="bas indent1"><span class="nm">(e)</span><span class="cl">Answer #2 (Beraisa - R. Yehudah):</span> If Reuven was Mekabel from a Nochri (and it gave birth), we estimate its value, he gives half of this to a Kohen;</p>
