<p class="bas subject"><span class="nm">1)</span><i>KORBANOS</i> FOR <i>NEZIRUS</i> THAT WAS ANNULLED</p>
<p class="bas indent1"><span class="nm">(a)</span><span class="cl">Question:</span> Who is the Tana of the following Beraisa?</p>
<p class="bas indent2"><span class="nm">1.</span><span class="cl">(Beraisa):</span> If a woman accepted Nezirus and became Teme'ah and her husband annulled her Nezirus, she brings Chatas ha'Of (a bird), but not Olas ha'Of.</p>
<p class="bas indent1"><span class="nm">(b)</span><span class="cl">Answer (Rav Chisda):</span> It is R. Yishmael.</p>
<p class="bas indent1"><span class="nm">(c)</span><span class="cl">Question:</span> What is R. Yishmael's opinion about a husband's annulment?</p>
<p class="bas indent2"><span class="nm">1.</span>If it uproots the vow retroactively, even Chatas ha'Of should not be needed;</p>
<p class="bas indent2"><span class="nm">2.</span>If it uproots the vow from the time of annulment and onwards, she should also need to bring Olas ha'Of!</p>
<p class="bas indent1"><span class="nm">(d)</span><span class="cl">Answer:</span> He holds that it uproots the vow retroactively. She brings Chatas ha'Of because he holds like R. Elazar ha'Kapar:</p>
<p class="bas indent2"><span class="nm">1.</span><span class="cl">(Beraisa - R. Elazar ha'Kapar b'Ribi) Question:</span> "Me'Asher Chata Al ha'Nefesh" - regarding which soul did he sin?</p>
<p class="bas indent2"><span class="nm">2.</span><span class="cl">Answer:</span> He sinned against his own soul, by denying himself wine.</p>
<p class="bas indent3"><span class="nm">i.</span>If one is called a sinner for denying himself wine, all the more so one who (fasts and) denies himself all food is called a sinner!</p>
<p class="bas indent1"><span class="nm">(e)</span><span class="cl">Question:</span> The verse discusses a Tamei Nazir, but we say that R. Elazar ha'Kapar calls even a Tahor Nazir a sinner!</p>
<p class="bas indent1"><span class="nm">(f)</span><span class="cl">Answer:</span> Indeed, also a Tahor Nazir sins. The verse was written regarding a Tamei Nazir, since he (repeats Nezirus and) sins twice.</p>
<p class="bas subject"><span class="nm">2)</span>WHEN DOES <i>TUM'AH</i> CANCEL DAYS?</p>
<p class="bas indent1"><span class="nm">(a)</span><span class="cl">(Mishnah):</span> If he left and entered (the cemetery), the days count.</p>
<p class="bas indent1"><span class="nm">(b)</span><span class="cl">Question:</span> Do the days count just because he left?!</p>
<p class="bas indent1"><span class="nm">(c)</span><span class="cl">Answer: (Shmuel):</span> He left, was sprinkled on (with water mixed with ashes of the red heifer on days three and seven), and immersed.</p>
<p class="bas indent1"><span class="nm">(d)</span><span class="cl">Question:</span> The Mishnah connotes that the days count because he re-entered the cemetery. Can we say that if he did not re-enter, the days would not count?!</p>
<p class="bas indent1"><span class="nm">(e)</span><span class="cl">Answer:</span> The Mishnah teaches an even bigger Chidush:</p>
<p class="bas indent2"><span class="nm">1.</span>Not only if he left the cemetery, but even if he re-enters, the days count.</p>
<p class="bas indent1"><span class="nm">(f)</span><span class="cl">Rav Kahana and Rav Asi (to Rav):</span> Why didn't you explain this to us?</p>
<p class="bas indent1"><span class="nm">(g)</span><span class="cl">Rav:</span> I thought that you did not need me to explain the Mishnah.</p>
<p class="bas indent1"><span class="nm">(h)</span><span class="cl">(Mishnah):</span> R. Eliezer says, if he re-entered on the same day, the day is not Batel. "The first days will fall" connotes that there must be (at least two) first days.</p>
<p class="bas indent1"><span class="nm">(i)</span><span class="cl">(Ula):</span> R. Eliezer said only this regarding a Tamei who accepted Nezirus, but if a Tahor Nazir became Tamei, even on the first day, the day is Batel.</p>
<p class="bas bbbline">19b----------------------------------------19b</p>
<p class="bas indent1"><span class="nm">(j)</span><span class="cl">(Rava):</span> R. Eliezer learns from "Ki Tamei Nizro" - because he accepted Nezirus in Tum'ah.</p>
<p class="bas indent1"><span class="nm">(k)</span><span class="cl">Question (Abaye - Beraisa) Suggestion:</span> If one said 'I am a Nazir for 100 days', and he became Tamei at the beginning, perhaps the first day should be wiped out!</p>
<p class="bas indent2"><span class="nm">1.</span><span class="cl">Rejection:</span> "The first days will fall" - there must be days. This man has only one first day.</p>
<p class="bas indent2"><span class="nm">2.</span><span class="cl">Suggestion:</span> If he became Tamei on day 100, perhaps this cancels the days he counted!</p>
<p class="bas indent2"><span class="nm">3.</span><span class="cl">Rejection:</span> "The first days will fall" implies that there are last days. This man has only one last day.</p>
<p class="bas indent2"><span class="nm">4.</span><span class="cl">Suggestion:</span> If he became Tamei on day 99, perhaps the days he counted are not cancelled!</p>
<p class="bas indent2"><span class="nm">5.</span><span class="cl">Rejection:</span> "The first days will fall" implies that there are last days. This man has first and last days.</p>
<p class="bas indent2"><span class="nm">6.</span>You cannot say that he was Tamei when he accepted Nezirus, since it says 'he became Tamei.' Still, Tum'ah on the first day does not cancel, for we require first days.</p>
<p class="bas indent1"><span class="nm">(l)</span>Ula is refuted.</p>
<p class="bas indent1"><span class="nm">(m)</span><span class="cl">Question (Rav Papa):</span> Does 'the first days' mean that two days have passed, and the third day has begun?</p>
<p class="bas indent2"><span class="nm">1.</span>Or, one day has passed, the second day has begun?</p>
<p class="bas indent1"><span class="nm">(n)</span>Abaye was unable to answer.</p>
<p class="bas indent1"><span class="nm">(o)</span><span class="cl">Answer (Rava):</span> It says "They will fall" (even partial days; Rashi (first Perush) - two full days).</p>
<p class="bas indent1"><span class="nm">(p)</span>The Torah needed to write "days" and "will fall (plural)":</p>
<p class="bas indent2"><span class="nm">1.</span>Had it written only "days", one might have thought that two days have passed, and the third has begun;</p>
<p class="bas indent2"><span class="nm">2.</span>Had it written only "will fall", one might have thought that this refers to even one day.</p>
<p class="bas subject"><span class="nm">3)</span>NEZIRUS IN CHUTZ LA'ARETZ</p>
<p class="bas indent1"><span class="nm">(a)</span><span class="cl">(Mishnah - Beis Shamai):</span> If one accepted a long Nezirus in Chutz la'Aretz, completed it and came to Eretz Yisrael, he must conduct 30 more days of Nezirus;</p>
<p class="bas indent1"><span class="nm">(b)</span>Beis Hillel say, he starts the entire Nezirus from the beginning;</p>
<p class="bas indent2"><span class="nm">1.</span>A case occurred in which Queen Hilni accepted to be a Nezirah for seven years if her son will return safely from war. He did. At the end of the seven years, she came up to Eretz Yisrael. Beis Hillel ruled that she must be a Nezirah for seven more years.</p>
<p class="bas indent2"><span class="nm">2.</span>At the end of those seven years, she became Teme'ah, and had to fulfill seven more years, a total of 21 years of Nezirus.</p>
<p class="bas indent1"><span class="nm">(c)</span>R. Yehudah says, she was a Nezirah for only 14 years.</p>
<p class="bas indent1"><span class="nm">(d)</span><span class="cl">(Gemara - Mishnah):</span> Beis Shamai say that he must conduct 30 more days of Nezirus; Beis Hillel say that he starts the entire Nezirus from the beginning.</p>
<p class="bas indent1"><span class="nm">(e)</span><span class="cl">Suggestion:</span> Beis Shamai hold that Tum'ah was decreed on the soil of Chutz la'Aretz, and Beis Hillel hold that anything in the airspace of Chutz la'Aretz is Tamei. (Since Beis Hillel are more stringent about Tum'ah, they are more stringent about Nezirus also. Tosfos' text - Beis Shamai hold that the air of Chutz la'Aretz is Tamei, and Beis Hillel hold that the soil is Tamei. Since Beis Hillel's decree resembles Tum'ah mid'Oraisa, they require the Nazir to act as if he became Tamei mid'Oraisa.)</p>
