<p class="bas indent2"><span class="nm">1.</span>If he said, "Bring salt or relish," he must bless again.</p>
<p class="bas indent1"><span class="nm">(b)</span><span class="cl">(R. Yochanan):</span> Even if he said, "Bring salt or relish," he need not bless again, but if he said, "Knead the bran [with water] for the cattle," he must bless again;</p>
<p class="bas indent1"><span class="nm">(c)</span><span class="cl">(Rav Sheshes):</span> Even if he said, "Knead the bran for the cattle," he need not bless again;</p>
<p class="bas indent2"><span class="nm">1.</span><span class="cl">(Rav Yehudah):</span> It is forbidden for one to eat before feeding his animals [that depend on him for food] -- "v'Nasati Esev b'Sadcha li'Vehemtecha v'Achalta v'Savata."</p>
<p class="bas indent1"><span class="nm">(d)</span><span class="cl">(Rava bar Shmuel):</span> The Botze'a may not bless until there is salt or relish in front of everyone at the meal.</p>
<p class="bas indent1"><span class="nm">(e)</span>Rava bar Shmuel went to the Reish Galusa's house; he blessed immediately (without waiting for them to bring salt or relish).</p>

<p class="bas indent1"><span class="nm">(g)</span><span class="cl">Rava:</span> No -- here, there is no need to wait (the bread is from finely-sifted flour, it does not need salt or relish).</p>
<p class="bas subject"><span class="nm">2)</span>HEALTHY PRACTICES</p>
<p class="bas indent1"><span class="nm">(a)</span><span class="cl">(Rava bar Shmuel):</span> One should not finish urinating [every drop] while standing (out of concern that drops will fall on his feet), but only while sitting.</p>
<p class="bas indent1"><span class="nm">(b)</span><span class="cl">(Rav Kahana):</span> If he is in loose dirt, he finishes even while standing (he is not concerned for drops).</p>
<p class="bas indent2"><span class="nm">1.</span>If there is no loose dirt available, he should stand on a high place and urinate onto an incline.</p>
<p class="bas indent1"><span class="nm">(c)</span><span class="cl">(Rava bar Shmuel; also, Beraisa #1):</span> After eating anything, one should eat salt; after drinking anything, one should drink water.</p>
<p class="bas indent1"><span class="nm">(d)</span><span class="cl">(Beraisa #2):</span> If one did not eat salt after eating, or did not drink water after drinking anything:</p>
<p class="bas indent2"><span class="nm">1.</span>If this was during the day, he is prone to get bad breath; if it was at night, he is prone to get Askarah (quinsy, an inflamation that can make one choke).</p>
<p class="bas indent1"><span class="nm">(e)</span><span class="cl">(Beraisa):</span> If one "floods" his food by drinking much water afterwards, he will not get intestinal sickness.</p>
<p class="bas indent1"><span class="nm">(f)</span><span class="cl">Question:</span> How much should one drink?</p>
<p class="bas indent1"><span class="nm">(g)</span><span class="cl">Answer (Rav Chisda):</span> He should drink one flask for bread.</p>
<p class="bas indent1"><span class="nm">(h)</span><span class="cl">(Rav Mari):</span> Eating lentils every 30 days prevents [constipation, thereby preventing] Askarah.</p>
<p class="bas indent2"><span class="nm">1.</span>One should not eat them every day, for this causes bad breath.</p>
<p class="bas indent1"><span class="nm">(i)</span><span class="cl">(Rav Mari):</span> Eating mustard every 30 days prevents sicknesses.</p>
<p class="bas indent2"><span class="nm">1.</span>One should not eat it every day, for this weakens the heart.</p>
<p class="bas indent1"><span class="nm">(j)</span><span class="cl">(Rav Chiya bar Ashi):</span> One who regularly eats small fish will not get intestinal sickness;</p>
<p class="bas indent2"><span class="nm">1.</span>Moreover, it increases fertility and improves the health of the whole body.</p>
<p class="bas indent1"><span class="nm">(k)</span><span class="cl">(Rav Chama b'Rebbi Chanina):</span> One who regularly eats Katzach (an herb) will not get heartache.</p>
<p class="bas indent1"><span class="nm">(l)</span><span class="cl">Question (Beraisa - R. Shimon ben Gamliel):</span> Katzach is one of 60 deadly poisons; if one sleeps to the east of his Goren (of Katzach), he causes his own death (for the west wind takes the smell to him).</p>
<p class="bas indent1"><span class="nm">(m)</span><span class="cl">Answer:</span> The smell is harmful, the taste is beneficial.</p>
<p class="bas indent1"><span class="nm">(n)</span>R. Yirmeyah's mother baked bread for him with Katzach (so its taste would be absorbed) and peeled it off (so its smell would not pervade the bread).</p>
<p class="bas subject"><span class="nm">3)</span>SPECIFIC BLESSINGS</p>

<p class="bas indent1"><span class="nm">(c)</span><span class="cl">(R. Zeira):</span> R. Yehudah learns from "Baruch Hash-m Yom Yom";</p>
<p class="bas indent2"><span class="nm">1.</span><span class="cl">Question:</span> Do we bless Hash-m only by day?!</p>
<p class="bas indent2"><span class="nm">2.</span><span class="cl">Answer:</span> Rather, we should bless him according to [what is special about] each day.</p>
<p class="bas indent2"><span class="nm">3.</span>Likewise, we should bless him according to each food!</p>
<p class="bas indent1"><span class="nm">(d)</span><span class="cl">(R. Zeira):</span> Hash-m's ways are unlike the ways of people:</p>
<p class="bas indent2"><span class="nm">1.</span>A person's vessel can hold things if it is empty, not if it is full. Hash-m's [creations] can contain if they are full (of Chochmah), but not if they are empty!</p>
<p class="bas indent2"><span class="nm">2.</span>"Im Shamo'a Tishma" -- if you listen [to Divrei Torah] once, you will listen again;</p>
<p class="bas indent2"><span class="nm">3.</span>Also, if you listen to what you already heard (review your learning), you willl understand new things; if you turn to idleness, you will not understand new things.</p>

<p class="bas indent1"><span class="nm">(a)</span><span class="cl">(Mishnah):</span> If one blessed Borei Pri ha'Adamah on fruits of a tree, he was Yotzei;</p>
<p class="bas indent1"><span class="nm">(b)</span>If one blessed Borei Pri ha'Etz on fruits of the ground, he was not Yotzei.</p>

<p class="bas indent1"><span class="nm">(d)</span><span class="cl">(Gemara) Question:</span> The Tana of the Mishnah holds that [fruits of] a tree grow primarily from the ground -- like whom is this?</p>
<p class="bas indent1"><span class="nm">(e)</span><span class="cl">Answer (Rav Nachman bar Yitzchak):</span> It is like R. Yehudah:</p>

<p class="bas indent2"><span class="nm">2.</span>R. Yehudah says, he brings Bikurim and recites Viduy Bikurim (the ground is intact, it is the primary source of the fruits).</p>
<p class="bas indent1"><span class="nm">(f)</span><span class="cl">(Mishnah):</span> [If one blessed Borei Pri ha'Etz] on fruits of the ground [he was not Yotzei].</p>
<p class="bas indent1"><span class="nm">(g)</span><span class="cl">Objection:</span> This is obvious!</p>
<p class="bas indent1"><span class="nm">(h)</span><span class="cl">Answer (Rav Nachman bar Yitzchak):</span> It is a Chidush according to R. Yehudah (the Tana of the Mishnah), who considers wheat to be a tree:</p>
<p class="bas indent2"><span class="nm">1.</span><span class="cl">(Beraisa - R. Meir):</span> The Etz ha'Da'as (Tree of Knowlede) was a vine, which brings more misery to the world than anything else;</p>
<p class="bas indent2"><span class="nm">2.</span>R. Yehudah says, it was wheat -- a child does not know to call to his parents until he tastes grain;</p>
<p class="bas indent2"><span class="nm">3.</span>R. Nechemyah says, it was a fig tree -- their remedy ("va'Yisperu Alei Se'enah," clothes made from fig leaves) was from the tree with which they sinned.</p>
<p class="bas indent2"><span class="nm">4.</span>One might have thought, since R. Yehudah considers wheat to be a tree, its blessing is Borei Pri ha'Etz;</p>
<p class="bas indent2"><span class="nm">5.</span>The Mishnah teaches, this is not so -- Borei Pri ha'Etz applies only when the branch remains after the fruit is taken, and it bears more fruits;</p>
<p class="bas bbbline">40b----------------------------------------40b</p>

<p class="bas indent2"><span class="nm">1.</span>R. Yosi only said that he was not Yotzei when he uses a text that Chachamim did not compose -- but since Chachamim composed she'Hakol Niheyeh bi'Devaro (for some foods), one could be Yotzei with it for other foods.</p>
