<p class="bas indent1"><span class="nm">(a)</span><span class="cl">Suggestion:</span> The following shows that R. Yochanan holds that Beis Shamai forbid redeeming Peros onto gold.</p>
<p class="bas indent2"><span class="nm">1.</span><span class="cl">(R. Yochanan):</span> One may not lend a Dinar for a Dinar (lest this lead to Ribis).</p>
<p class="bas indent2"><span class="nm">2.</span><span class="cl">Question:</span> To which kind of Dinarim does he refer?</p>
<p class="bas indent3"><span class="nm">i.</span><span class="cl">Suggestion:</span> He forbids lending a silver Dinar for a silver Dinar.</p>
<p class="bas indent3"><span class="nm">ii.</span><span class="cl">Rejection:</span> Surely, all agree that silver is a currency with respect to itself (and permit this)!</p>
<p class="bas indent2"><span class="nm">3.</span><span class="cl">Answer:</span> Rather, he forbids lending a gold Dinar for a gold Dinar.</p>
<p class="bas indent2"><span class="nm">4.</span><span class="cl">Question:</span> According to whom is this forbidden?</p>
<p class="bas indent3"><span class="nm">i.</span>It is not like Beis Hillel. They say that gold is the currency!</p>
<p class="bas indent2"><span class="nm">5.</span><span class="cl">Answer:</span> Rather, it is like Beis Shamai. They must hold that it is never considered a currency (therefore, they forbid redeeming Peros onto gold).</p>
<p class="bas indent1"><span class="nm">(b)</span><span class="cl">Rejection:</span> Rather, R. Yochanan says that Beis Shamai permit redeeming Peros onto gold;</p>
<p class="bas indent2"><span class="nm">1.</span>Loans are different. Since regarding commerce gold is the commodity (with respect to silver), we consider its value to fluctuate, therefore also regarding loans, one may not lend it Dinar for Dinar.</p>
<p class="bas indent1"><span class="nm">(c)</span><span class="cl">Support (Ravin citing R. Yochanan):</span> Even though one may not one may not lend a (gold) Dinar for a Dinar, one may use it to redeem Peros. (He explains the opinion of Beis Shamai, who forbid lending a (gold) Dinar for a Dinar.)</p>
<p class="bas indent1"><span class="nm">(d)</span>(We conclude that Reish Lakish says that Beis Shamai forbid redeeming Peros onto gold.)</p>
<p class="bas indent1"><span class="nm">(e)</span><span class="cl">Question (against Reish Lakish - Mishnah #2 - Beis Shamai):</span> One may exchange a full Sela's worth of copper coins of Ma'aser Sheni for silver coins (to lighten his load for his trip to Yerushalayim);</p>
<p class="bas indent2"><span class="nm">1.</span>Beis Hillel say, he may exchange half for silver, half he must leave as copper (lest the demand for copper coins in Yerushalayim inflate their price, and the silver coins of Ma'aser Sheni will decrease in value).</p>
<p class="bas indent2"><span class="nm">2.</span><span class="cl">Summation of question:</span> Beis Shamai permit redeeming (Peros) onto copper coins. All the more so, they permit redeeming onto gold!</p>
<p class="bas indent1"><span class="nm">(f)</span><span class="cl">Answer:</span> No. In places where copper is used, it is more accepted than gold.</p>
<p class="bas indent1"><span class="nm">(g)</span><span class="cl">Version #2 (R. Yochanan or Reish Lakish):</span> (In Mishnah #1,) Beis Shamai and Beis Hillel argue about converting Sela'im to gold Dinarim. Beis Shamai expound "ha'Kesef" - the first money (on which Peros were redeemed) must be brought to Yerushalayim, not second money (on which the first money was redeemed);</p>
<p class="bas indent2"><span class="nm">1.</span>Beis Hillel hold that "ha'Kesef" is an inclusion. It permits second money.</p>
<p class="bas indent2"><span class="nm">2.</span>All agree that we may redeem Peros onto (gold) Dinarim.</p>
<p class="bas indent1"><span class="nm">(h)</span><span class="cl">(The other of R. Yochanan and Reish Lakish):</span> They even argue about redeeming Peros onto Dinarim.</p>
<p class="bas indent1"><span class="nm">(i)</span>(The following three questions are against the first opinion, which holds that they argue about second money.)</p>
<p class="bas indent1"><span class="nm">(j)</span><span class="cl">Question #1:</span> The Mishnah should rather teach that they argue about redeeming Sela'im onto Sela'im (both of silver)!</p>
<p class="bas indent1"><span class="nm">(k)</span><span class="cl">Answer:</span> If so, one might have thought that they only argue there, but Beis Shamai admits that one may redeem Sela'im onto (gold) Dinarim, for gold is currency with respect to silver. The Mishnah discusses Sela'im onto Dinarim, to teach that this is not so.</p>
<p class="bas indent1"><span class="nm">(l)</span><span class="cl">Question #2 (Mishnah #2 - Beis Shamai):</span> One may exchange a full silver Sela in Yerushalayim for (copper) Perutos;</p>
<p class="bas indent2"><span class="nm">1.</span>Beis Hillel say, he may exchange half for copper, but he must leave half in silver coins (lest he not spend all of it this festival, and incur a loss due to corrosion, or a second moneychanger's commission if he trades them back for silver).</p>
<p class="bas indent2"><span class="nm">2.</span>Beis Shamai do not forbid exchanging silver for copper due to 'second money.' All the more so, they permit exchanging silver for gold, which is more important!</p>
<p class="bas indent1"><span class="nm">(m)</span><span class="cl">Answer (Rava):</span> The law in Yerushalayim is different. There, "v'Nasata ha'Kesef..." (you will spend the money on any food you desire. Perutos are useful for buying food!)</p>
<p class="bas indent1"><span class="nm">(n)</span><span class="cl">Question #3 (Mishnah #3 - Beis Shamai):</span> One may exchange a full Sela's worth of copper coins of Ma'aser Sheni for silver coins (before going to Yerushalayim);</p>
<p class="bas indent2"><span class="nm">1.</span>Beis Hillel say, he may exchange half for silver, but he must leave half copper. (Beis Shamai do not forbid exchanging coins for coins due to 'second money.' This refutes the first opinion! Therefore, we reject Version #2.)</p>
<p class="bas subject"><span class="nm">2)</span>ANOTHER EXPLANATION OF THE MISHNAH</p>
<p class="bas indent1"><span class="nm">(a)</span><span class="cl">Version #3 (R. Yochanan or Reish Lakish):</span> (In Mishnah #1) they argue about converting Sela'im to gold Dinarim. Beis Shamai decree lest one delay bringing his Ma'aser money to Yerushalayim (until he has enough to redeem onto a gold coin);</p>
<p class="bas bbbline">45b----------------------------------------45b</p>
<p class="bas indent2"><span class="nm">1.</span>Beis Hillel do not decree. One would (not delay; he would) take the silver coins.</p>
<p class="bas indent2"><span class="nm">2.</span>All agree that we may redeem Peros onto (gold) Dinarim. Since Peros rot, one would not delay until he has enough for a full Dinar.</p>
<p class="bas indent1"><span class="nm">(b)</span><span class="cl">(The other of R. Yochanan and Reish Lakish):</span> Beis Shamai decree even about redeeming Peros onto Dinarim.</p>
<p class="bas indent1"><span class="nm">(c)</span><span class="cl">Support:</span> According to Version #3, it is clear why Mishnah #1 says 'one may (or may not) convert' (l'Chatchilah), for mid'Oraisa, all agree that one may redeem. According to Versions 1 and 2, the Mishnah <i>should</i> say 'one can (or cannot) redeem' (for Beis Shamai say that even b'Di'eved, it is not redeemed)!</p>
<p class="bas subject"><span class="nm">3)</span>CAN MONEY BE USED FOR <i>CHALIPIN</i>?</p>
<p class="bas indent1"><span class="nm">(a)</span><span class="cl">(Rav or Levi):</span> A coin can be used to do Chalipin (i.e. through transferring a coin, the seller or giver is Makneh his object to the buyer or receiver).</p>
<p class="bas indent1"><span class="nm">(b)</span><span class="cl">(The other of Rav and Levi):</span> It cannot be used to do Chalipin.</p>
<p class="bas indent1"><span class="nm">(c)</span><span class="cl">(Rav Papa):</span> The latter opinion disqualifies it because one relies on the mintage of a coin, and this is prone to be invalidated (the king may change the coins).</p>
<p class="bas indent1"><span class="nm">(d)</span><span class="cl">Question (against the latter opinion - Mishnah):</span> Gold acquires silver.</p>
<p class="bas indent2"><span class="nm">1.</span><span class="cl">Suggestion:</span> The Mishnah implies that gold acquires silver through Chalipin (for then, the silver is truly <i>acquired</i> through transferring the gold. If the Mishnah referred to Kinyan Meshichah, transferring the gold would obligate the buyer to pay silver, but would not actually acquire the silver for the seller.)</p>
<p class="bas indent1"><span class="nm">(e)</span><span class="cl">Answer:</span> No, it acquires through Meshichah.</p>
<p class="bas indent1"><span class="nm">(f)</span><span class="cl">Question:</span> If so, it should rather say 'gold obligates silver'!</p>
<p class="bas indent1"><span class="nm">(g)</span><span class="cl">Answer:</span> Indeed, that is the correct text of the Mishnah.</p>
<p class="bas indent1"><span class="nm">(h)</span><span class="cl">Support #1 (Reisha):</span> Silver does not acquire gold.</p>
<p class="bas indent2"><span class="nm">1.</span>We understand if the Mishnah discusses Meshichah. Gold is the commodity and silver is the currency, therefore silver does not acquire gold.</p>
<p class="bas indent2"><span class="nm">2.</span>But if the Mishnah means Chalipin, both should acquire each other!</p>
<p class="bas indent1"><span class="nm">(i)</span><span class="cl">Support #2 (Beraisa):</span> Silver does not acquire gold: if Reuven sold 25 silver Dinarim for a gold Dinar, even if Shimon did Meshichah on the silver, he does not acquire until Reuven does Meshichah on the gold.</p>
<p class="bas indent2"><span class="nm">1.</span>We understand if the Beraisa refers to Kinyan Meshichah. Silver is the currency, therefore it does not acquire gold.</p>
<p class="bas indent2"><span class="nm">2.</span>But if it means Chalipin, it should acquire!</p>
<p class="bas indent1"><span class="nm">(j)</span><span class="cl">Question (Reisha):</span> Gold acquires silver. If Reuven sold a gold Dinar for 25 silver Dinarim, once Shimon does Meshichah on the gold, Reuven acquires the silver, wherever it is.</p>
<p class="bas indent2"><span class="nm">1.</span>Granted, if it means Chalipin, he acquires the silver, wherever it is;</p>
<p class="bas indent2"><span class="nm">2.</span>But if it means Kinyan Meshichah, why does it say 'he acquires the silver, wherever it is'? Shimon merely owes him the silver!</p>
<p class="bas indent1"><span class="nm">(k)</span><span class="cl">Answer (Rav Ashi):</span> It refers to Kinyan Meshichah. It means that he acquires the silver, however they stipulated. If he agreed to give new coins, he cannot give old coins, even if they are better.</p>
<p class="bas indent2"><span class="nm">1.</span><span class="cl">Question:</span> What is the reason?</p>
<p class="bas indent2"><span class="nm">2.</span><span class="cl">Answer:</span> The seller can say that he needs new coins because he plans to keep them for a long time.</p>
<p class="bas indent1"><span class="nm">(l)</span><span class="cl">(Rav Papa):</span> Even according to the opinion that a coin cannot be used (given) to do Chalipin, it can be acquired through Chalipin;</p>
<p class="bas indent1"><span class="nm">(m)</span>This is like Rav Nachman says about Peros. It cannot be used to do Chalipin, but it can be acquired through Chalipin.</p>
