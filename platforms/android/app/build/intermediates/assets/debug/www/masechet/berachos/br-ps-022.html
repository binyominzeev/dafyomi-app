<p class="bas indent1"><span class="nm">(a)</span><span class="cl">Question:</span> But R. Yehudah holds that a Ba'al Keri is not Meharher! (Rather, he says the words!)</p>
<p class="bas indent2"><span class="nm">1.</span><span class="cl">(Beraisa - R. Meir):</span> If a Ba'al Keri does not have a place to immerse, he says Shema but does not say the blessings before or after;</p>
<p class="bas indent2"><span class="nm">2.</span>He eats bread and says the blessings afterwards, but not before;</p>
<p class="bas indent3"><span class="nm">i.</span>He does not utter [Shema or Birkas ha'Mazon] with his lips, he is just Meharher.</p>
<p class="bas indent2"><span class="nm">3.</span>R. Yehudah says, he says all of them with his lips.</p>
<p class="bas indent1"><span class="nm">(b)</span><span class="cl">Answer (Rav Nachman bar Yitzchak):</span> R. Yehudah equates the law of a Ba'al Keri to Hilchos Derech Eretz (proper conduct):</p>
<p class="bas indent2"><span class="nm">1.</span><span class="cl">(Beraisa):</span> "V'Hodatam l'Vanecha uli'Venei Vanecha... Yom Asher Amadta Lifnei Hash-m Elokecha b'Chorev" -- learning Torah should always be done with awe, fear, and trembling, just like at Matan Torah.</p>
<p class="bas indent3"><span class="nm">i.</span>This is the source to permit a Bo'al Nidah (who immersed after relations), a Zav, and a Metzora to learn Torah, Nevi'im, Kesuvim, Mishnah, Gemara, Halachah and Agadah (even though they are Teme'im), and to forbid a Ba'al Keri (for this comes from frivolity).</p>
<p class="bas indent2"><span class="nm">2.</span>R. Yosi permits a Ba'al Keri to learn Mishnayos that he knows fluently and can say quickly, but he may not teach others;</p>
<p class="bas indent2"><span class="nm">3.</span>R. Yonasan bar Yosef permits him to teach Mishnayos, but not to teach Gemara;</p>
<p class="bas indent2"><span class="nm">4.</span>R. Nasan bar Avishalom permits teaching even Gemara, but he may not say Hash-m's name;</p>
<p class="bas indent2"><span class="nm">5.</span><span class="cl">Version #1:</span> R. Yochanan ha'Sandlar says, he should not expound at all (lest he will need to cite verses);</p>

<p class="bas indent2"><span class="nm">7.</span>R. Yehudah says, he may learn Hilchos Derech Eretz.</p>
<p class="bas indent2"><span class="nm">8.</span>A case occurred, R. Yehudah was a Ba'al Keri; he was walking along the riverbank, his Talmidim asked him to teach them Hilchos Derech Eretz. He immersed and taught them.</p>

<p class="bas indent2"><span class="nm">10.</span><span class="cl">R. Yehudah:</span> For others I am lenient, but for myself I am stringent.</p>
<p class="bas indent1"><span class="nm">(c)</span><span class="cl">(Beraisa - R. Yehudah ben Beseira):</span> Divrei Torah cannot become Tamei (a Ba'al Keri need not immerse to learn or teach).</p>

<p class="bas indent2"><span class="nm">1.</span>It says, "ha'Lo Cho Devari ka'Esh" -- just like fire is not Mekabel Tum'ah, neither are Divrei Torah.</p>
<p class="bas indent1"><span class="nm">(e)</span><span class="cl">(Beraisa - R. Yonasan bar Yosef):</span> He may teach Mishnayos, but not Gemara.</p>
<p class="bas indent1"><span class="nm">(f)</span>This supports R. Ila'i:</p>
<p class="bas indent2"><span class="nm">1.</span><span class="cl">(R. Ila'i):</span> The Halachah is, he may teach Mishnayos, but not Gemara.</p>
<p class="bas indent1"><span class="nm">(g)</span>[Other] Tana'im [also] argue about this:</p>

<p class="bas indent3"><span class="nm">i.</span>R. Yoshiyah derives from "Lo Sizra Karmecha Kil'ayim" (there is Kil'ayim even without the vineyard) that one is liable for Kil'ei ha'Kerem only if he seeds wheat, barley and a grape seed together.</p>

<p class="bas indent1"><span class="nm">(a)</span><span class="cl">(Beraisa):</span> If nine Kabim of water were poured on a Ba'al Keri, he is Tahor.</p>
<p class="bas indent1"><span class="nm">(b)</span>Nachum Ish Gam Zu whispered this to R. Akiva, who then whispered this to Ben Azai, who then taught it to his Talmidim in public.</p>

<p class="bas indent2"><span class="nm">1.</span><span class="cl">(R. Yosi bar Avin or R. Yosi bar Zvida):</span> He taught it to his Talmidim.</p>
<p class="bas indent2"><span class="nm">2.</span><span class="cl">(The other of R. Yosi bar Avin and R. Yosi bar Zvida):</span> He whispered it to his Talmidim.</p>
<p class="bas indent2"><span class="nm">3.</span>The first opinion says that he taught it -- he wanted to publicize it to prevent Bitul Torah (to make it easier for Talmidim to learn) and to prevent Bitul of procreation (lest Talmidim be deterred by the need to immerse).</p>
<p class="bas indent2"><span class="nm">4.</span>The second opinion says that he whispered it -- he feared to publicize it, lest Talmidim be with their wives too often, like roosters.</p>
<p class="bas indent1"><span class="nm">(d)</span><span class="cl">(R. Yanai):</span> I heard that some are lenient (to rely on nine Kabim) and others are stringent (to immerse) -- if one is stringent, his days and years will be lengthened.</p>
<p class="bas indent1"><span class="nm">(e)</span><span class="cl">R. Yehoshua ben Levi:</span> What purpose is there to those who immerse in the morning (from Keri)?</p>

<p class="bas indent2"><span class="nm">2.</span><span class="cl">Answer:</span> Since nine Kabim suffice (for a sick person, and most Talmidim are considered weak and sick), there is no need to immerse.</p>
<p class="bas indent1"><span class="nm">(f)</span><span class="cl">(R. Chanina):</span> Takanas Ezra was a great protection (against licentiousness)!</p>
<p class="bas indent2"><span class="nm">1.</span>A case occurred, a man solicited a woman to have relations with him; she rebuked him -- there is no place to immerse here (you will be unable to learn afterwards)! He desisted.</p>

<p class="bas indent1"><span class="nm">(l)</span><span class="cl">Answer (R. Zeira):</span> The Heter of nine Kabim is like [immersion in] 40 Se'ah -- just as 40 Se'ah works only in one way (immersion), also nine Kabim works only in one way (pouring).</p>
