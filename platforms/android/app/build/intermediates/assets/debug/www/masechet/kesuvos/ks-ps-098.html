<p class="bas subject"><span class="nm">1)</span>SELLING OUTSIDE OF BEIS DIN</p>
<p class="bas indent1"><span class="nm">(a)</span>A woman seized a silver cup towards payment of her Kesuvah, and demanded food.</p>
<p class="bas indent1"><span class="nm">(b)</span><span class="cl">(Rava):</span> The orphans must feed her. No one rules like R. Shimon, who says that being owed part of the Kesuvah is unlike being owed the entire Kesuvah.</p>
<p class="bas indent1"><span class="nm">(c)</span><span class="cl">Question (Rabah brei d'Rava):</span> If a widow sells outside of Beis Din, must she swear?</p>
<p class="bas indent2"><span class="nm">1.</span><span class="cl">Question (Rav Yosef):</span> Why don't you ask if she must announce for a month that the property is being sold before she may sell it?</p>
<p class="bas indent2"><span class="nm">2.</span><span class="cl">Answer (Rabah brei d'Rava):</span> I know that she need not announce before selling;</p>
<p class="bas indent3"><span class="nm">i.</span><span class="cl">(R. Zeira):</span> If a widow evaluated property and took it herself towards payment of her Kesuvah, it is not hers.</p>
<p class="bas indent3"><span class="nm">ii.</span><span class="cl">Question:</span> If she announced that the property is for sale, why can't she keep it?</p>
<p class="bas indent3"><span class="nm">iii.</span><span class="cl">Answer:</span> We must say that she did not announce.</p>
<p class="bas indent3"><span class="nm">iv.</span><span class="cl">Inference:</span> If she took the property herself, it is void. Had she sold it to others, the sale would stand!</p>
<p class="bas indent2"><span class="nm">3.</span><span class="cl">Rejection:</span> Really, she did announce. She may not keep the property because Beis Din did not empower her to take it.</p>
<p class="bas indent2"><span class="nm">4.</span>This is like the case of a man that was watching fodder (or wood) of orphans. He evaluated that it is worth 400 Zuz, and took it for himself. It rose in value to 600 Zuz;</p>
<p class="bas indent2"><span class="nm">5.</span><span class="cl">R. Ami:</span> Who empowered you to take it? (I.e. it is not yours).</p>
<p class="bas indent1"><span class="nm">(d)</span>The Halachah is, she must swear. She need not announce that the property is for sale.</p>
<p class="bas subject"><span class="nm">2)</span>A WIDOW THAT SOLD ORPHANS' PROPERTY</p>
<p class="bas indent1"><span class="nm">(a)</span><span class="cl">(Mishnah):</span> If a widow's Kesuvah was 200 Dinarim and she sold property of the orphans which was worth 100 for 200, or property worth 200 for 100, in either case she has received her full Kesuvah;</p>
<p class="bas indent1"><span class="nm">(b)</span>If her Kesuvah was 100, and she sold property worth 101 for 100, the sale is void, even if she says that she will return the extra Dinar;</p>
<p class="bas indent1"><span class="nm">(c)</span>R. Shimon ben Gamliel says, the sale stands unless the extra land sold is a field fitting to sow nine Kavim of seed, or a garden fitting to sow half a Kav;</p>
<p class="bas indent1"><span class="nm">(d)</span>According to R. Akiva, the excess must be a quarter Kav (to invalidate the sale).</p>
<p class="bas indent1"><span class="nm">(e)</span>If her Kesuvah was 400, and she sold 100, and another 100, and the last sale was worth 101 and she sold it for 100 - the last sale is void, the other sales stand.</p>
<p class="bas indent1"><span class="nm">(f)</span><span class="cl">(Gemara) Question:</span> When she sells land worth 200 for 100, the orphans tell her that she lost 100. When she sells land worth 100 for 200, why can't she say that she profited?</p>
<p class="bas indent1"><span class="nm">(g)</span><span class="cl">Answer (Rav Nachman):</span> In our Mishnah, Rebbi taught us that the owner of the property receives the profits.</p>
<p class="bas bbbline">98b----------------------------------------98b</p>
<p class="bas indent2"><span class="nm">1.</span><span class="cl">(Beraisa - R. Yehudah):</span> If a Shali'ach bought something, and the seller gave one extra, the Shali'ach keeps it;</p>
<p class="bas indent2"><span class="nm">2.</span>R. Yosi says, he shares it with the one he bought for.</p>
<p class="bas indent2"><span class="nm">3.</span><span class="cl">Contradiction (Beraisa - R. Yosi):</span> The one who sent him keeps the extra one.</p>
<p class="bas indent2"><span class="nm">4.</span><span class="cl">Answer (Rami bar Chama):</span> If the sold item has a fixed price, they share the extra one. If the price varies, the one who sent him keeps it.</p>
<p class="bas indent1"><span class="nm">(h)</span><span class="cl">(Rav Papa):</span> The Halachah is, if the sold item has a fixed price, they share it. If the price is variable, the one who sent him keeps it.</p>
<p class="bas indent1"><span class="nm">(i)</span><span class="cl">Question:</span> What does Rav Papa teach (that Rami bar Chama did not teach)?</p>
<p class="bas indent1"><span class="nm">(j)</span><span class="cl">Answer:</span> He teaches that Rami bar Chama's answer is correct.</p>
<p class="bas subject"><span class="nm">3)</span>A <i>SHALI'ACH</i> WHO SOLD TOO MUCH</p>
<p class="bas indent1"><span class="nm">(a)</span><span class="cl">Version #1 - Question:</span> If Reuven told a Shali'ach to sell for him (land fitting to sow) 15 Sa'im and the Shali'ach sold 30, what is the law?</p>
<p class="bas indent2"><span class="nm">1.</span>Do we say that he fulfilled his mission and added to it, and the sale of 15 stands?</p>
<p class="bas indent2"><span class="nm">2.</span>Or, do we say that he deviated from his mission, and the sale is totally void?</p>
<p class="bas indent1"><span class="nm">(b)</span><span class="cl">Answer #1 (R. Yakov - Mishnah):</span> If Reuven told his servant to give one piece of meat to each guest; the servant told the guests to take two each and the guests took three each (and the meat was found to be Hekdesh), all transgressed Me'ilah.</p>
<p class="bas indent2"><span class="nm">1.</span>This connotes the Shali'ach fulfilled his mission and added to it. Since Reuven's command was fulfilled, he transgressed Me'ilah.</p>
<p class="bas indent2"><span class="nm">2.</span><span class="cl">Question:</span> But if we say that he changed his mission, why does Reuven transgress?</p>
<p class="bas indent3"><span class="nm">i.</span><span class="cl">(Mishnah):</span> The sender transgresses Me'ilah only if the Shali'ach fulfilled his mission.</p>
<p class="bas indent1"><span class="nm">(c)</span><span class="cl">Rejection:</span> The case is, the servant said 'take one like my master said, and a second on my authorization', and they took three.</p>
<p class="bas indent1"><span class="nm">(d)</span><span class="cl">Answer #2 (Mishnah):</span> If her Kesuvah was 100, and she sold property worth 101 for 100, the sale is void.</p>
<p class="bas indent2"><span class="nm">1.</span><span class="cl">Suggestion:</span> The case is, she sold property worth 101 for 101.</p>
<p class="bas indent2"><span class="nm">2.</span>The Mishnah says 'for 100', i.e. for the 100 she was entitled to. It continues 'even if she says that she will return the extra Dinar', i.e. she offers to buy back the extra land sold and return it. The Halachah is, the sale is void.</p>
<p class="bas indent1"><span class="nm">(e)</span><span class="cl">Rejection (Rav Huna brei d'Rav Nasan):</span> No, the case is, she sold the land for less than its value (i.e. for 100).</p>
