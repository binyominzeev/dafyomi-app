<p class="bas subject"><span class="nm">1)</span>THE AFFLICTIONS OF IYOV</p>
<p class="bas indent1"><span class="nm">(a)</span>Messengers cam in succession telling Iyov about the loss of his property and children. Iyov accepted it and blessed Hash-m. The Satan still praised Avraham, and Hash-m praised Iyov.</p>
<p class="bas indent1"><span class="nm">(b)</span><span class="cl">(R. Yochanan):</span> "Va'Tesiseni" - if the verse did not say that Hash-m was enticed, it would be forbidden to say this.</p>
<p class="bas indent2"><span class="nm">1.</span><span class="cl">(Beraisa):</span> The Satan descends, causes people to sin, ascends, prosecutes, and receives permission to kill.</p>
<p class="bas indent2"><span class="nm">2.</span>The Satan thought that if Iyov himself was stricken, he would blaspheme. Hash-m authorized the Satan to do as he wanted to him, on condition that he keep Iyov alive.</p>
<p class="bas indent2"><span class="nm">3.</span><span class="cl">(R. Yitzchak):</span> The Satan was in more pain than Iyov. i/t was very hard to ravage his body and preserve his life.</p>
<p class="bas indent1"><span class="nm">(c)</span><span class="cl">(Reish Lakish):</span> The Satan, evil inclination, and the angel of death these are all one.</p>
<p class="bas indent2"><span class="nm">1.</span>A Gezerah Shavah teaches that the Satan is the evil inclination;</p>
<p class="bas indent2"><span class="nm">2.</span>Since Hash-m told him to guard Iyov's life, we learn that he can take lives, i.e. he is the angel of death.</p>
<p class="bas indent1"><span class="nm">(d)</span><span class="cl">(R. Yehoshua ben Levi):</span> The Satan and Peninah both intended for the sake of Heaven.</p>
<p class="bas indent2"><span class="nm">1.</span>The Satan was concerned that Hash-m's love of Iyov might detract from his love for Avraham.</p>
<p class="bas indent2"><span class="nm">2.</span>Peninah pained Chanah (about being barren) "Ba'avor Hare'imah", in order that Chanah would pray to Hash-m. (Ben Yehoyada - surely, she was punished so severely because she intended to pain her. Rather, Elkanah did not rebuke her because she said that she intends l'Shem Shamayim.)</p>
<p class="bas indent2"><span class="nm">3.</span>Rav Acha bar Yakov expounded like this, and the Satan kissed his knees.</p>
<p class="bas subject"><span class="nm">2)</span>IYOV'S REACTION</p>
<p class="bas indent1"><span class="nm">(a)</span><span class="cl">(Rava):</span> "Lo Chata Iyov bi'Sfasav (he did not sin with his lips, i.e. speech)", but he sinned in his heart.</p>
<p class="bas indent1"><span class="nm">(b)</span><span class="cl">Question:</span> What does it mean "Eretz Nitenah b'Yad Rasha"?</p>
<p class="bas indent1"><span class="nm">(c)</span><span class="cl">Answer #1 (Rava):</span> Iyov blasphemed (he said this about Hash-m).</p>
<p class="bas indent1"><span class="nm">(d)</span><span class="cl">Answer #2 (Abaye):</span> Iyov said this about the Satan.</p>
<p class="bas indent2"><span class="nm">1.</span>Tana'im argued about this. R. Eliezer said like Rava, and R. Yehoshua said like Abaye.</p>
<p class="bas indent1"><span class="nm">(e)</span><span class="cl">(Rava):</span> "Al Datecha Lo Ersha v'Ein mi'Yadcha Matzil" - Iyov sought to exempt the whole world from judgment, by saying that there is no free choice;</p>
<p class="bas indent2"><span class="nm">1.</span>Just like Hash-m created Tahor animals and Tamei animals, He created Tzadikim and Resha'im, one cannot change the way he was created!</p>
<p class="bas indent1"><span class="nm">(f)</span><span class="cl">Question:</span> How did his friends respond?</p>
<p class="bas indent1"><span class="nm">(g)</span><span class="cl">Answer:</span> Indeed Hash-m created the evil inclination, but He also created the Torah to enable people to overcome it.</p>
<p class="bas indent1"><span class="nm">(h)</span><span class="cl">(Rava):</span> "Birkas Oved Alai Tavo" - Iyov would steal orphans' fields, improve them and return them;</p>
<p class="bas indent2"><span class="nm">1.</span>"V'Lev Almanah Arnin" - if a widow was unable to remarry, Iyov would speak on her behalf or say she was his relative to help her remarry.</p>
<p class="bas indent1"><span class="nm">(i)</span><span class="cl">(Rav):</span> Iyov's mouth should be filled with dirt for the following things he said:</p>
<p class="bas indent2"><span class="nm">1.</span>"Lu Shakol Yishakel (if only we would see who is justified)" - one speaks to a person thisly, but not to Hash-m!</p>
<p class="bas indent2"><span class="nm">2.</span>"Lo Yesh Beineinu Mochi'ach" - a slave does not rebuke his master!</p>
<p class="bas indent1"><span class="nm">(j)</span><span class="cl">(Rava):</span> His mouth should be filled with dirt also for "Bris Korati l'Einai u'Mah Esbonen Al Besulah." He credits himself for not looking at other women;</p>
<p class="bas indent2"><span class="nm">1.</span>Avraham did not even look at his own wife - "Hinei Na Yadati Ki Ishah Yefas Mar'eh At";</p>
<p class="bas indent2"><span class="nm">2.</span><span class="cl">Inference:</span> Until now, he did not know!</p>
<p class="bas indent1"><span class="nm">(k)</span><span class="cl">(Rava):</span> "Yored She'ol Lo Ya'aleh" - Iyov denied revival of the dead.</p>
<p class="bas indent1"><span class="nm">(l)</span><span class="cl">(Rava):</span> "Bi'Sarah Yeshufeni" - he blasphemed by speaking of Se'arah (a stormy wind), and Hash-m answered by speaking of Sa'ar (hair);</p>
<p class="bas indent2"><span class="nm">1.</span>Iyov suggested that a stormy wind caused a confusion, and the punishment intended for Oyev (the enemy) was meted to Iyov;</p>
<p class="bas indent2"><span class="nm">2.</span>"Va'Ya'an Hash-m... Min ha'Se'arah..." - I created so many hairs on a person's head, each is fed from its own follicle;</p>
<p class="bas indent3"><span class="nm">i.</span>If two hairs would come from the same follicle, the person would be blinded;</p>
<p class="bas indent2"><span class="nm">3.</span>I did not confuse two hairs. Will you say that I confused Oyev and Iyov?!</p>
<p class="bas indent2"><span class="nm">4.</span>"Mi Filag la'Shetef Te'alah" - I created clouds, with so many drops of water; each has its own cavity;</p>
<p class="bas indent3"><span class="nm">i.</span>If two drops would come from the same cavity, they would make the ground muddy and unable to bear fruit.</p>
<p class="bas indent2"><span class="nm">5.</span>I did not confuse two drops. Will you say that I confused Oyev and Iyov?!</p>
<p class="bas indent3"><span class="nm">i.</span><span class="cl">Question:</span> What is the source that "Te'alah" means 'cavity'?</p>
<p class="bas indent3"><span class="nm">ii.</span><span class="cl">Answer (Rabah bar Shila):</span> "Va'Ya'as Te'alah" (Eliyahu dug a trench around his Altar).</p>
<p class="bas indent2"><span class="nm">6.</span>"V'Derech la'Chaziz Kolos" - I created many sounds (thunder) in the clouds, each has its own channel;</p>
<p class="bas indent3"><span class="nm">i.</span>If two sounds would come from the same channel, they would destroy the world.</p>
<p class="bas indent2"><span class="nm">7.</span>I did not confuse two sounds. Will you say that I confused Oyev and Iyov?!</p>
<p class="bas indent2"><span class="nm">8.</span>"Ha'Yadata Es Ledes Ya'alei Sala" - a wild goat is cruel to its young, it ascends a mountain in order that the baby will fall to its death when it is born;</p>
<p class="bas bbbline">16b----------------------------------------16b</p>
<p class="bas indent2"><span class="nm">9.</span>I prepare a Nesher (eagle or vulture) to catch the baby on its wings, and return it to the mother.</p>
<p class="bas indent3"><span class="nm">i.</span>If the Nesher would come a moment earlier or later, the baby would die.</p>
<p class="bas indent2"><span class="nm">10.</span>I did not miscalculate by a moment. Will you say that I confused Oyev and Iyov?!</p>
<p class="bas indent2"><span class="nm">11.</span>"Cholel Ayalos Tishmor" - the womb of a hart (wild goat) is narrow. When it is ready to give birth, I send a snake to bite it, causing the womb to open more;</p>
<p class="bas indent3"><span class="nm">i.</span>If the snake would come a moment earlier or later, it would die.</p>
<p class="bas indent2"><span class="nm">12.</span>I did not miscalculate by a moment. Will you say that I confused Oyev and Iyov?!</p>
<p class="bas indent1"><span class="nm">(m)</span><span class="cl">(Rava):</span> "Iyov Lo b'Da'as Yedaber" teaches that one is not liable for what he says when in pain.</p>
<p class="bas indent1"><span class="nm">(n)</span><span class="cl">Question:</span> "Iyov's three friends heard of his afflictions... va'Yiva'adu Yachdav." What does this mean?</p>
<p class="bas indent1"><span class="nm">(o)</span><span class="cl">Answer (Rav Yehudah):</span> They all arrived at the same moment.</p>
<p class="bas indent2"><span class="nm">1.</span><span class="cl">(Beraisa):</span> Each was 300 Parsa'os (a Parsah is about four kilometers) from each other.</p>
<p class="bas indent1"><span class="nm">(p)</span><span class="cl">Question:</span> How did they know of his afflictions?</p>
<p class="bas indent1"><span class="nm">(q)</span><span class="cl">Answer:</span> Each had a crown (another version - tree) with images of the faces of his three friends;</p>
<p class="bas indent2"><span class="nm">1.</span>If a face withered, this showed that he was suffering afflictions.</p>
<p class="bas indent2"><span class="nm">2.</span><span class="cl">(Rava):</span> If one does not have friends like Iyov's, it is better to die.</p>
<p class="bas subject"><span class="nm">3)</span>HAVING DAUGHTERS</p>
<p class="bas indent1"><span class="nm">(a)</span><span class="cl">(R. Yochanan):</span> "Hechel ha'Adam <i>Larov</i>... u'Vanos Yuldu Lahem" - when a girl is born, Rivya (reproduction) comes to the world.</p>
<p class="bas indent1"><span class="nm">(b)</span><span class="cl">(Reish Lakish):</span> Merivah (quarrels) comes to the world.</p>
<p class="bas indent1"><span class="nm">(c)</span><span class="cl">Question (Reish Lakish against R. Yochanan):</span> According to you, why didn't Hash-m give Iyov twice as many daughters as he originally had (just like he doubled everything else)?</p>
<p class="bas indent1"><span class="nm">(d)</span><span class="cl">Answer (R. Yochanan):</span> They were not doubled in number, but they were doubled in beauty (we learn from their names);</p>
<p class="bas indent2"><span class="nm">1..</span>Yamimah was as clear as the Yom (the daytime sun);</p>
<p class="bas indent2"><span class="nm">2..</span>Ketzi'ah smelled like Ketziah (cassia, an ingredient of the incense);</p>
<p class="bas indent2"><span class="nm">3.</span><span class="cl">(D'Vei R. Shila):</span> Keren ha'Puch was (black) like the horn of a Keresh (giraffe).</p>
<p class="bas indent2"><span class="nm">4.</span><span class="cl">Rejection (Rabanan in Eretz Yisrael):</span> This is not beautiful!</p>
<p class="bas indent2"><span class="nm">5.</span><span class="cl">(Rav Chisda):</span> Rather, she was like garden saffron.</p>
<p class="bas indent1"><span class="nm">(e)</span>A daughter was born to R. Shimon, the son of Rebbi. He felt bad.</p>
<p class="bas indent2"><span class="nm">1.</span><span class="cl">Rebbi:</span> Rivya came to the world!</p>
<p class="bas indent2"><span class="nm">2.</span><span class="cl">Bar Kapara:</span> Rebbi gave empty consolation.</p>
<p class="bas indent3"><span class="nm">i.</span><span class="cl">(Beraisa):</span> The world needs males and females, but happy is one who has sons, and woe to the one who has daughters;</p>
<p class="bas indent3"><span class="nm">ii.</span>The world needs perfumers and tanners. Happy is a perfumer, and woe to the tanner (he absorbs the odor of excrement, which is used in tanning).</p>
<p class="bas indent1"><span class="nm">(f)</span>Tana'im argue whether having daughters is good.</p>
<p class="bas indent2"><span class="nm">1.</span><span class="cl">(Beraisa - R. Meir):</span> "Va'shem Berach Es Avraham ba'Kol" - he did not have a daughter;</p>
<p class="bas indent2"><span class="nm">2.</span>R. Yehudah says, this teaches that he had a daughter;</p>
<p class="bas indent2"><span class="nm">3.</span>Others say, 'he had a daughter named 'Bakol'.</p>
<p class="bas indent2"><span class="nm">4.</span>R. Eliezer ha'Moda'i says, he knew how to read the stars. All the kings of the east and west constantly came to him for advice.</p>
<p class="bas indent2"><span class="nm">5.</span>R. Shimon says, he hung a special stone around his neck. Any sick person who looked at it was be cured immediately;</p>
<p class="bas indent3"><span class="nm">i.</span>When Avraham died, Hash-m hung the stone on the sun;</p>
<p class="bas indent3"><span class="nm">ii.</span><span class="cl">(Abaye):</span> That is why people say 'a sickness lightens when day comes.</p>
<p class="bas indent2"><span class="nm">6.</span>Also, he was blessed 'ba'Kol', that he died before Esav rebelled, and Yishmael repented in Avraham's lifetime.</p>
<p class="bas subject"><span class="nm">4)</span>YISHMAEL REPENTED, BUT ESAV DID NOT</p>
<p class="bas indent1"><span class="nm">(a)</span><span class="cl">Question:</span> What is the source that that Avraham died before Esav rebelled?</p>
<p class="bas indent1"><span class="nm">(b)</span><span class="cl">Answer:</span> The day that Esav sold his birthright, Yakov was cooking lentils to console Yitzchak, for Avraham died that day.</p>
<p class="bas indent1"><span class="nm">(c)</span><span class="cl">Question:</span> Why are lentils fitting for a mourner?</p>
<p class="bas indent1"><span class="nm">(d)</span><span class="cl">Answer #1 (Rabah bar Mari):</span> Just like lentils have no mouth (opening), also a mourner (talks little).</p>
<p class="bas indent1"><span class="nm">(e)</span><span class="cl">Answer #2:</span> Just like lentils are round, also mourning is a cycle, everyone will eventually be mourned over by others.</p>
<p class="bas indent1"><span class="nm">(f)</span><span class="cl">Question:</span> What is the difference between these answers?</p>
<p class="bas indent1"><span class="nm">(g)</span><span class="cl">Answer:</span> They argue about consoling with eggs (they have no mouth, but they are not round like a circle).</p>
<p class="bas indent1"><span class="nm">(h)</span><span class="cl">(R. Yochanan):</span> Esav committed five transgressions that day. He had Bi'ah with a Na'arah Me'orasah, he murdered, he denied Hash-m, he denied revival of the dead, and he cast off the privilege of the firstborn (i.e. to do the Avodah).</p>
<p class="bas indent1"><span class="nm">(i)</span><span class="cl">Question:</span> What is the source that Yishmael repented in Avraham's lifetime?</p>
<p class="bas indent1"><span class="nm">(j)</span><span class="cl">Answer:</span> We learn from the following.</p>
<p class="bas indent2"><span class="nm">1.</span><span class="cl">Question (Ravina):</span> Does 'Geviyah' always refer to a Tzadik's death?</p>
<p class="bas indent2"><span class="nm">2.</span><span class="cl">Answer (Rav Chama bar Buzi):</span> Yes.</p>
<p class="bas indent2"><span class="nm">3.</span><span class="cl">Question (Ravina):</span> It says this regarding the generation of the flood!</p>
<p class="bas indent2"><span class="nm">4.</span><span class="cl">Answer (Rav Chama):</span> I meant that 'Geviyah' and 'Asifah' together always refer to a Tzadik's death</p>
<p class="bas indent2"><span class="nm">5.</span><span class="cl">Question:</span> It says 'Geviyah' and 'Asifah' by Yishmael!</p>
<p class="bas indent2"><span class="nm">6.</span><span class="cl">Answer (Rava):</span> R. Yochanan taught that Yishmael repented in Avraham's lifetime.</p>
<p class="bas indent3"><span class="nm">i.</span>It says "va'Yikberu Oso Yitzchak v'Yishmael" (Yitzchak was first).</p>
<p class="bas indent2"><span class="nm">7.</span><span class="cl">Question:</span> Perhaps the verse lists them in order of their Chachmah!</p>
<p class="bas indent2"><span class="nm">8.</span>Rejection "Va'Yikberu Oso Esav v'Yakov"!</p>
<p class="bas indent3"><span class="nm">i.</span>Rather, we must say that Yitzchak is listed first because Yishmael deferred to him, i.e. he repented.</p>
