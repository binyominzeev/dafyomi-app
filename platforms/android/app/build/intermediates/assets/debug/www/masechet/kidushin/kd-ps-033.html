<p class="bas subject"><span class="nm">1)</span>EXEMPTIONS FROM STANDING</p>
<p class="bas indent1"><span class="nm">(a)</span><span class="cl">(Beraisa) Suggestion:</span> Perhaps one must give money to the Zaken to honor him.</p>
<p class="bas indent1"><span class="nm">(b)</span><span class="cl">Rejection:</span> "You will rise and honor" - just like one does not lose money by rising, one need not lose by honoring.</p>
<p class="bas indent1"><span class="nm">(c)</span><span class="cl">Question:</span> Why do we assume that one does not lose money by rising?</p>
<p class="bas indent2"><span class="nm">1.</span>Does not the verse include a man drilling through pearls (to thread them, a very lucrative job), and he must stop working when he rises?</p>
<p class="bas indent1"><span class="nm">(d)</span><span class="cl">Answer:</span> The verse equates rising to honoring. Just like one need not desist (from working) to honor (honor connotes through gifts or verbally), also to rise.</p>
<p class="bas indent2"><span class="nm">1.</span>The verse also equates honoring to rising. Just like one does not lose money by rising, one need not lose by honoring.</p>
<p class="bas indent2"><span class="nm">2.</span>From here we learn that craftsmen are not allowed (alternatively - obligated) to rise for Chachamim.</p>
<p class="bas indent1"><span class="nm">(e)</span><span class="cl">Question (Mishnah):</span> (When people come to Yerushalayim bringing Bikurim (first fruits), all craftsmen rise for them, greet them and bless them.</p>
<p class="bas indent1"><span class="nm">(f)</span><span class="cl">Answer (R. Yochanan):</span> They must rise for people bringing Bikurim, but not for Chachamim.</p>
<p class="bas indent1"><span class="nm">(g)</span><span class="cl">(Rebbi Yosi bar Avin):</span> This shows the greatness of one doing a Mitzvah. He is honored more than Chachamim!</p>
<p class="bas indent1"><span class="nm">(h)</span><span class="cl">Rejection:</span> Perhaps he is not worthy of such honor. Chachamim enacted to honor people bringing Bikurim, lest they decide not to come again.</p>
<p class="bas indent1"><span class="nm">(i)</span><span class="cl">(Beraisa) Suggestion:</span> Perhaps one must rise in the privy or bathhouse...</p>
<p class="bas indent1"><span class="nm">(j)</span><span class="cl">Question:</span> Is one truly exempt?!</p>
<p class="bas indent2"><span class="nm">1.</span>Once, in the bathhouse, R. Shimon bar Rebbi walked by R. Chiya (and on another occasion, Bar Kapara), who had learned from him, yet he did not rise for R. Shimon. R. Shimon complained to  Rebbi.</p>
<p class="bas indent2"><span class="nm">2.</span><span class="cl">Rebbi:</span> Perhaps he was thinking about what you taught him, and he did not notice you.</p>
<p class="bas indent2"><span class="nm">3.</span><span class="cl">Inference:</span> Had he noticed, he would be obligated to rise!</p>
<p class="bas indent1"><span class="nm">(k)</span><span class="cl">Answer:</span> One is obligated to rise in the outer rooms of a bathhouse, but not in the inner rooms.</p>
<p class="bas indent1"><span class="nm">(l)</span><span class="cl">Support:</span> These cases must have been in the outer rooms.</p>
<p class="bas indent2"><span class="nm">1.</span><span class="cl">(Rabah bar bar Chanah):</span> One may think about Torah anywhere except for a privy or (the inner rooms of) a bathhouse.</p>
<p class="bas indent1"><span class="nm">(m)</span><span class="cl">Rejection:</span> Sometimes a Chacham cannot avoid thinking about Torah in these places.</p>
<p class="bas indent1"><span class="nm">(n)</span><span class="cl">(Beraisa) Suggestion:</span> Perhaps one may close his eyes as if he does not see the Zaken.</p>
<p class="bas indent1"><span class="nm">(o)</span><span class="cl">Question:</span> Does the Beraisa discuss Resha'im?!</p>
<p class="bas indent1"><span class="nm">(p)</span><span class="cl">Answer:</span> It means, perhaps one may close his eyes before the Chacham is so close that he will need to rise if he sees him;</p>
<p class="bas indent2"><span class="nm">1.</span>"You will rise and you will fear" teaches that one may not.</p>
<p class="bas indent1"><span class="nm">(q)</span><span class="cl">(Beraisa):</span> Rising that shows honor is when the Chachamim is within four Amos.</p>
<p class="bas indent1"><span class="nm">(r)</span><span class="cl">(Abaye):</span> This is for a Chacham who is not his primary Rebbi. For one's primary Rebbi, he must rise as soon as he can see him.</p>
<p class="bas indent2"><span class="nm">1.</span>Abaye would rise as soon as he saw the ear of the donkey on which Rav Yosef (his Rebbi) used to ride.</p>
<p class="bas indent1"><span class="nm">(s)</span>Abaye was riding on the bank of a river; Rav Mesharshiya and other Chachamim were on the other side; they did not rise.</p>
<p class="bas indent2"><span class="nm">1.</span><span class="cl">Abaye:</span> Am I not your primary Rebbi?!</p>
<p class="bas indent2"><span class="nm">2.</span><span class="cl">Chachamim:</span> We did not notice you.</p>
<p class="bas subject"><span class="nm">2)</span>HOW THE ZAKEN SHOULD ACT</p>
<p class="bas indent1"><span class="nm">(a)</span><span class="cl">(Beraisa - R. Shimon ben Elazar):</span> "Zaken and you will fear" teaches that he should not unnecessarily cause people to stand for him.</p>
<p class="bas indent1"><span class="nm">(b)</span><span class="cl">(Abaye):</span> If the Zaken takes a longer route to avoid making people stand for him, his life will be lengthened.</p>
<p class="bas indent2"><span class="nm">1.</span>Abaye and R. Zeira used to take longer routes.</p>
<p class="bas indent1"><span class="nm">(c)</span>Ravina was sitting in front of R. Yirmiyah mi'Difti. A man passed by without covering his head.</p>
<p class="bas indent2"><span class="nm">1.</span><span class="cl">Ravina:</span> That man is so brazen!</p>
<p class="bas indent2"><span class="nm">2.</span><span class="cl">R. Yirmiyah:</span> Perhaps he is from the city of Machsiya. People there are used to Chachamim, and feel informal with them.</p>
<p class="bas indent1"><span class="nm">(d)</span><span class="cl">(Isi ben Yehudah):</span> "You will rise in front of an elder" - any elder.</p>
<p class="bas indent1"><span class="nm">(e)</span><span class="cl">(R. Yochanan):</span> The Halachah follows Isi.</p>
<p class="bas indent1"><span class="nm">(f)</span>R. Yochanan would rise for Nochri elders, because they have experienced many afflictions and many miracles.</p>
<p class="bas indent2"><span class="nm">1.</span>Rava would not rise for them, but he would show honor.</p>
<p class="bas indent2"><span class="nm">2.</span>Abaye would give them a hand.</p>
<p class="bas indent2"><span class="nm">3.</span>Rava and Rav Nachman would send messengers to give them a hand.</p>
<p class="bas indent3"><span class="nm">i.</span>Rav Nachman thought that it would belittle the honor of Torah if he himself would help them.</p>

<p class="bas subject"><span class="nm">3)</span>RISING FOR ONE'S REBBI</p>
<p class="bas indent1"><span class="nm">(a)</span><span class="cl">(R. Eibo):</span> A Chachamim may not rise for his Rebbi more than twice a day, morning and evening, lest he honor his Rebbi more than he honors Hash-m (he says Shema Yisrael only twice a day).</p>
<p class="bas indent1"><span class="nm">(b)</span><span class="cl">Question (Beraisa - R. Shimon ben Elazar):</span> "Zaken, you will fear" teaches that a Zaken should not cause that people will have to rise for him.</p>
<p class="bas indent2"><span class="nm">1.</span>If others must rise only twice a day, they should do so! What is wrong if he makes them rise?!</p>
<p class="bas indent2"><span class="nm">2.</span>Rather, we must say that they must rise every time he passes!</p>
<p class="bas indent1"><span class="nm">(c)</span><span class="cl">Answer:</span> Really, people need rise only twice a day. Still, the Zaken should minimize how much they must rise for him.</p>
<p class="bas indent1"><span class="nm">(d)</span><span class="cl">(R. Elazar):</span> Any Chacham who does not rise for his Rebbi is called wicked. He will not live long, and he will forget his learning.</p>
<p class="bas indent2"><span class="nm">1.</span>"A Rasha will not live long... who does not fear Hash-m" refers to (not) rising for a Chacham, about which it says "you will fear Hash-m".</p>
<p class="bas indent2"><span class="nm">2.</span><span class="cl">Question:</span> Perhaps it refers to usury or false measures, about which it says "you will fear Hash-m"!</p>
<p class="bas indent2"><span class="nm">3.</span><span class="cl">Answer:</span> R. Elazar learns from a Gezeirah Shavah "Pnei-Pnei".</p>
<p class="bas indent1"><span class="nm">(e)</span><span class="cl">Question:</span> If a son is his father's Rebbi, should he rise for his father?</p>
<p class="bas indent1"><span class="nm">(f)</span><span class="cl">Answer:</span> Yes. Rav Yehudah taught his father, yet Shmuel told Rav Yehudah to rise for his father.</p>
<p class="bas indent1"><span class="nm">(g)</span><span class="cl">Rejection:</span> Rav Yehudah's father is an exception. He was an awesome Tzadik, and even Shmuel used to rise for him.</p>
<p class="bas indent1"><span class="nm">(h)</span><span class="cl">Question:</span> If so, why did Shmuel need to tell Rav Yehudah to rise for him? (Surely, this was to teach that a son must rise for his father, even if he is his Rebbi?)</p>
<p class="bas indent1"><span class="nm">(i)</span><span class="cl">Answer:</span> He told him that when Rav Yehudah's father enters after Shmuel, he should only rise when his father enters (Shmuel pardoned the honor due to himself).</p>
<p class="bas indent1"><span class="nm">(j)</span><span class="cl">Question:</span> Must a man rise for his son, if his son is his Rebbi?</p>
<p class="bas indent1"><span class="nm">(k)</span><span class="cl">Answer:</span> R. Yehoshua ben Levi said 'the only reason I rise for my son is because he married into the family of the Nasi.'</p>
<p class="bas indent2"><span class="nm">1.</span><span class="cl">Inference:</span> This is because R. Yehoshua ben Levi was his son's Rebbi. Had he been his son's Talmid, that would (also) require him to rise for him!</p>
<p class="bas indent1"><span class="nm">(l)</span><span class="cl">Rejection:</span> No. He meant, even if my son were my Rebbi, that would not obligate me to rise for him, for he is my son;</p>
<p class="bas indent2"><span class="nm">1.</span>I would rise for him only due to the honor of the Nasi.</p>
<p class="bas indent1"><span class="nm">(m)</span><span class="cl">Question:</span> Is riding like walking (if a Chacham rides by, must people rise for him)?</p>
<p class="bas indent1"><span class="nm">(n)</span><span class="cl">Answer (Abaye - Mishnah):</span> If someone with Tum'as Tzara'as sits under a tree, and a Tahor person stands underneath, the latter becomes Tamei;</p>
<p class="bas indent2"><span class="nm">1.</span>If the Metzora stands under a tree and the Tahor sits underneath, he remains Tahor;</p>
<p class="bas indent2"><span class="nm">2.</span>If the Metzora sat down, the Tahor person would become Tamei.</p>
<p class="bas indent2"><span class="nm">3.</span>The same applies to a stone from a house with Tzara'as (that Ploni is holding, under a tree. It is Metamei Tehorim under the tree only if Ploni sits.)</p>
<p class="bas indent3"><span class="nm">i.</span><span class="cl">(Rav Nachman bar Kohen):</span> This teaches that riding is like walking. (Just like the law of the  stone depends on the person holding it, also one riding is like the animal carrying him, i.e. like one who is walking.)</p>
<p class="bas indent1"><span class="nm">(o)</span><span class="cl">Question:</span> Must one rise for a Sefer Torah?</p>
<p class="bas indent1"><span class="nm">(p)</span><span class="cl">Answer (R. Chilkiyah and...):</span> We stand for those that learn Torah, all the more so for a Torah itself!</p>
<p class="bas indent1"><span class="nm">(q)</span>R. Ilai and R. Yakov bar Zavdi rose for R. Shemen bar Aba.</p>
<p class="bas indent2"><span class="nm">1.</span><span class="cl">R. Shemen:</span> That was unnecessary! Firstly, you are also Chachamim;</p>
<p class="bas indent2"><span class="nm">2.</span>Secondly, people engaging in Torah need not stand for those that learn it!</p>
<p class="bas indent3"><span class="nm">i.</span><span class="cl">(R. Elazar):</span> A Chacham may not rise for his Rebbi while he is learning.</p>
<p class="bas indent1"><span class="nm">(r)</span>Abaye would curse those who ruled like R. Elazar.</p>
<p class="bas subject"><span class="nm">4)</span>HOW FAR DOES ONE STAND FOR CHACHAMIM?</p>
<p class="bas indent1"><span class="nm">(a)</span><span class="cl">(R. Ami or R. Yitzchak Nafcha):</span> "They looked at Moshe until he entered the tent" - they looked contemptuously;</p>
<p class="bas indent1"><span class="nm">(b)</span><span class="cl">(The other of R. Ami and R. Yitzchak Nafcha):</span> This teaches how long one must stand when the Nasi passes.</p>
<p class="bas indent2"><span class="nm">1.</span><span class="cl">(Chizkiyah):</span> One must rise when a Chacham comes within four Amos. When he (leaves and) is four Amos away, one may sit;</p>
<p class="bas indent2"><span class="nm">2.</span>One must rise when he sees the head of Beis Din coming. When he (leaves and) is four Amos away, one may sit;</p>
<p class="bas indent2"><span class="nm">3.</span>For the Nasi, one must rise when one sees him coming. When he sits in his place, one may sit - "they looked at Moshe until he entered the tent."</p>
