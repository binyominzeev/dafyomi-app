<p class="bas subject"><span class="nm">1)</span>WHEN A <i>NAZIR</i> <i>OLAM</i> CUTS HIS HAIR</p>
<p class="bas indent1"><span class="nm">(a)</span><span class="cl">(Beraisa - Rebbi):</span> He cuts his hair once a year - "at the end of the term, from time to time"</p>
<p class="bas indent2"><span class="nm">1.</span>Rebbi learns a Gezeirah Shavah "Yamim-Yamim" from (rights to redeem) a house (that one sold) in a walled city. Just like there, "Yamim" means 12 months, also, here.</p>
<p class="bas indent1"><span class="nm">(b)</span>R. Nehorai says, he cuts his hair every 30 days;</p>
<p class="bas indent1"><span class="nm">(c)</span>R. Yosi says, he cuts it every Erev Shabbos, for this is normal for sons of kings.</p>
<p class="bas indent1"><span class="nm">(d)</span><span class="cl">Question:</span> How can Rebbi learn 12 months from the Gezeirah Shavah? Rebbi expounds that "Yamim" means two (he cannot redeem within two days)!</p>
<p class="bas indent1"><span class="nm">(e)</span><span class="cl">Answer:</span> Avshalom would cut his hair "when it became too cumbersome." The Gezeirah Shavah cannot teach that this was after two days!</p>
<p class="bas indent1"><span class="nm">(f)</span><span class="cl">Suggestion:</span> Perhaps we should learn two years, from a Gezeirah Shavah with "mi'Ketz Shenasayim Yamim"!</p>
<p class="bas indent1"><span class="nm">(g)</span><span class="cl">Rejection:</span> Regarding Avshalom, it says only "Yamim", not years. We learn from a similar source (a house in a walled city), and not from "Shenasayim Yamim."</p>
<p class="bas indent1"><span class="nm">(h)</span><span class="cl">Suggestion:</span> Perhaps we should learn one month, from a Gezeirah Shavah with "until a month of days"?</p>
<p class="bas indent1"><span class="nm">(i)</span><span class="cl">Rejection:</span> We learn "Yamim" from "Yamim", and not from "Chodesh Yamim."</p>
<p class="bas indent1"><span class="nm">(j)</span><span class="cl">Suggestion:</span> Perhaps we should learn from a Gezeirah Shavah with "mi'Yamim Yamimah"! (Benos Yisrael went four days every year, i.e. every three months, to cry over Yiftach's daughter.)</p>
<p class="bas indent1"><span class="nm">(k)</span><span class="cl">Rejection #1:</span> We learn "Yamim" from "Yamim", and not from "Yamimah."</p>
<p class="bas indent2"><span class="nm">1.</span><span class="cl">Question:</span> We may learn from a different word!</p>
<p class="bas indent3"><span class="nm">i.</span><span class="cl">(Tana d'Vei R. Yishmael):</span> It says "V'Shav ha'Kohen... u'Va ha'Kohen." A Gezeirah Shavah (Shivah-Bi'ah) equates these.</p>
<p class="bas indent2"><span class="nm">2.</span><span class="cl">Answer:</span> If there is no better match, we may learn a Gezeirah Shavah between different words. If there are more similar words, we learn from them.</p>
<p class="bas indent1"><span class="nm">(l)</span><span class="cl">Rejection #2:</span> We cannot learn from there. We have no source that the four days were evenly spaced throughout the year.</p>
<p class="bas indent1"><span class="nm">(m)</span><span class="cl">(Beraisa - R. Nehorai):</span> He may cut his hair once every 30 days.</p>
<p class="bas indent2"><span class="nm">1.</span>Kohanim cut their hair this often, because after this it is too long. The same applies to a Nazir Olam!</p>
<p class="bas indent1"><span class="nm">(n)</span><span class="cl">(Beraisa - R. Yosi):</span> He may cut it every Erev Shabbos (for this is normal for princes).</p>
<p class="bas indent1"><span class="nm">(o)</span><span class="cl">Question:</span> If so, how was Avshalom different than his brothers?</p>
<p class="bas indent1"><span class="nm">(p)</span><span class="cl">Answer #1:</span> When Yom Tov fell during the week, his brothers would cut their hair on Erev Yom Tov, but he did not.</p>
<p class="bas indent1"><span class="nm">(q)</span><span class="cl">Answer #2:</span> His brothers could cut their hair in the morning, but he would cut only in the afternoon (after bringing the Korbanos - Rosh).</p>
<p class="bas indent1"><span class="nm">(r)</span><span class="cl">Question:</span> It says "at the end of 40 years." From when do they begin?</p>
<p class="bas indent1"><span class="nm">(s)</span><span class="cl">Answer (R. Nehorai):</span> This is from when Yisrael requested a king;</p>
<p class="bas indent2"><span class="nm">1.</span><span class="cl">(Beraisa):</span> They requested a king in the 10th year of Shmuel's leadership over Yisrael.</p>
<p class="bas subject"><span class="nm">2)</span><i>STAM</i> <i>NEZIRUS</i> IS 30 DAYS</p>
<p class="bas indent1"><span class="nm">(a)</span><span class="cl">(Mishnah):</span> Stam (unspecified) Nezirus is 30 days.</p>
<p class="bas indent1"><span class="nm">(b)</span><span class="cl">Question:</span> What is the source for this?</p>
<p class="bas indent1"><span class="nm">(c)</span><span class="cl">Answer #1 (Rav Masna):</span> "Yihyeh (he will be) Kadosh" - the numerical value of Yihyeh is 30.</p>
<p class="bas indent1"><span class="nm">(d)</span><span class="cl">Answer #2 (Bar Pada):</span> This corresponds to the 29 times "Nazir" (or variant forms) appears in this Parashah in the Torah.</p>
<p class="bas indent1"><span class="nm">(e)</span><span class="cl">Question:</span> Why doesn't Rav Masna learn like Bar Pada?</p>
<p class="bas indent1"><span class="nm">(f)</span><span class="cl">Answer:</span> Some of the occurrences are expounded to teach laws, so we may not count them:</p>
<p class="bas indent2"><span class="nm">1.</span>"From wine and string drink Yazir" forbids wine of a Mitzvah just like optional wine;</p>
<p class="bas indent2"><span class="nm">2.</span>"Lindor Neder Nazir Lehazir la'Shem" teaches that if a Nazir accepts Nezirus, he must fulfill it when he finishes his current Nezirus.</p>
<p class="bas bbbline">5b----------------------------------------5b</p>
<p class="bas indent1"><span class="nm">(g)</span><span class="cl">Defense of Bar Pada:</span> Certainly, at least one of the 29 is not expounded. Since that one comes to teach about the duration of Stam Nezirus, all come for this.</p>
<p class="bas indent1"><span class="nm">(h)</span><span class="cl">(Mishnah):</span> Stam Nezirus is 30 days.</p>
<p class="bas indent1"><span class="nm">(i)</span><span class="cl">Question:</span> This is like Rav Masna, and refutes Bar Pada!</p>
<p class="bas indent1"><span class="nm">(j)</span><span class="cl">Answer (on behalf of Bar Pada):</span> Since he shaves (and brings Korbanos) on the 30th day, the Tana considers the Nezirus to be 30 days.</p>
<p class="bas indent1"><span class="nm">(k)</span><span class="cl">(Mishnah):</span> If one said 'I am a Nazir', he shaves on the 31st day.</p>
<p class="bas indent1"><span class="nm">(l)</span><span class="cl">Question:</span> This is like Rav Masna. According to Bar Pada, he may shave on day 30!</p>
<p class="bas indent1"><span class="nm">(m)</span><span class="cl">Counter-question (Bar Pada - Seifa):</span> If he shaved on day 30, he fulfilled the Nezirus.</p>
<p class="bas indent2"><span class="nm">1.</span>The Seifa supports Bar Pada. The Reisha is a decree, due to one who accepted Nezirus for 30 full days.</p>
<p class="bas indent1"><span class="nm">(n)</span><span class="cl">Question:</span> How does Rav Masna explain the Seifa?</p>
<p class="bas indent1"><span class="nm">(o)</span><span class="cl">Answer:</span> He holds that Miktzas ha'Yom k'Kulo (observing Nezirus for part of the (30th) day is like the full day).</p>
<p class="bas indent1"><span class="nm">(p)</span><span class="cl">Question (Mishnah):</span> If one said 'I am a Nazir for 30 days', if he shaved on day 30, he did not fulfill his vow. (This shows that Miktzas ha'Yom is not k'Kulo!)</p>
<p class="bas indent1"><span class="nm">(q)</span><span class="cl">Answer:</span> The case is, he said 30 full days (some texts - it is as if he said 30 full days, i.e. surely he said '30' to obligate full days).</p>
<p class="bas indent1"><span class="nm">(r)</span><span class="cl">Question (Mishnah):</span> If one accepted to be a Nazir twice, he shaves for the first Nezirus on day 31, and shaves for the second Nezirus on day 61.</p>
<p class="bas indent2"><span class="nm">1.</span>This is like Rav Masna, and unlike Bar Pada!</p>
