<p class="bas subject"><span class="nm">1)</span>OTHER POSSIBLE LASHES FOR PLOWING ONE FURROW (cont.)</p>
<p class="bas indent1"><span class="nm">(a)</span><span class="cl">Question (Abaye - Mishnah):</span> One who cooks Gid ha'Nasheh in milk on Yom Tov, and eats it, is lashed five times - for eating Gid ha'Nasheh, for cooking unnecessarily on Yom Tov, for cooking meat and milk, for eating meat and milk, and for burning on Yom Tov.</p>
<p class="bas indent2"><span class="nm">1.</span>He is lashed twice for Melachos on Yom Tov!</p>
<p class="bas indent1"><span class="nm">(b)</span><span class="cl">Answer #1 (Rava):</span> The text of the Beraisa is mistaken. It should omit burning on Yom Tov, and it should say that the Gid was of a Neveilah (the fifth lashes are for eating Neveilah).</p>
<p class="bas indent1"><span class="nm">(c)</span><span class="cl">Question:</span> R. Chiya taught that he is lashed twice for eating and three times for cooking!</p>
<p class="bas indent1"><span class="nm">(d)</span><span class="cl">Answer #2 (Rava):</span> Rather, it should omit burning, and say that the wood was from an Asherah. He transgressed "v'Lo Yidbak b'Yadcha Me'umah Min ha'Cherem"!</p>
<p class="bas indent1"><span class="nm">(e)</span><span class="cl">Objection (Rav Acha brei d'Rava):</span> If so, he also transgresses "v'Lo Savi To'evah El Beisecha"!</p>
<p class="bas indent1"><span class="nm">(f)</span><span class="cl">Answer #3 (Rav Acha brei d'Rava):</span> Rather, the wood was Hekdesh, and he transgressed "va'Ashereihem Tisrefun ba'Esh...; Lo Sa'asun Ken la'Shem."</p>
<p class="bas indent1"><span class="nm">(g)</span><span class="cl">Question #2 (why our Mishnah (21b) say that he is lashed only eight times - R. Hoshaya):</span> He can transgress also planting in a Nachal Eisan (a valley where an Eglah Arufah was beheaded) - "Asher Lo Ye'aved Bo v'Lo Yizare'a"!</p>
<p class="bas indent1"><span class="nm">(h)</span><span class="cl">Question #3 (R. Chananya):</span> He can transgress also erasing Hash-m's name (by plowing through it) - "v'Ibadtem Es Shemam...  Lo Sa'asun Ken la'Shem."</p>
<p class="bas indent1"><span class="nm">(i)</span><span class="cl">Question #4 (R. Avahu):</span> He can transgress also cutting off Tzara'as - "Hishamer b'Nega ha'Tzara'as"!</p>
<p class="bas indent1"><span class="nm">(j)</span><span class="cl">Question #5 (Abaye):</span> He can transgress also displacing the Choshen from the Efod (garments of the Kohen Gadol), and removing the poles that carry the Aron from the rings on the Aron! (Ritva - if he plows with the poles while wearing the Choshen, he is liable for not returning them.)</p>
<p class="bas indent1"><span class="nm">(k)</span><span class="cl">Question #6 (Rav Ashi):</span> He can transgress also plowing with wood of an Asherah - "v'Lo Yidbak b'Yadcha Me'umah Min ha'Cherem"!</p>
<p class="bas indent1"><span class="nm">(l)</span><span class="cl">Question #7 (Ravina):</span> He can transgress also cutting good trees - "Ki Mimenu Sochel v'Oso Lo Sichros."</p>
<p class="bas indent1"><span class="nm">(m)</span><span class="cl">Question #8 (R. Ze'ira):</span> He can transgress also a false oath, if he had sworn not to plow on Yom Tov!</p>
<p class="bas indent1"><span class="nm">(n)</span><span class="cl">Objection (R. Mani):</span> That oath does not take effect, for the oath of Sinai (when Yisrael accepted the Torah) already forbids this!</p>
<p class="bas indent1"><span class="nm">(o)</span><span class="cl">Answer:</span> The case is, he swore not to plow on Chol or Yom Tov. Since the oath takes effect regarding Chol, it also takes effect regarding Yom Tov.</p>
<p class="bas indent1"><span class="nm">(p)</span><span class="cl">Answer #1 (to Question #8):</span> The Mishnah does not list transgressions that can be annulled (he can permit his oath).</p>
<p class="bas indent2"><span class="nm">1.</span><span class="cl">Question:</span> the Mishnah lists Hekdesh. He can annul his Hekdesh!</p>
<p class="bas indent2"><span class="nm">2.</span><span class="cl">Answer:</span> The case is, it is a Bechor. (It is Hekdesh due to birth. He cannot annul it!)</p>
<p class="bas indent2"><span class="nm">3.</span><span class="cl">Question:</span> The Mishnah lists Tum'ah of a Nazir. He can annul his Nezirus!</p>
<p class="bas indent2"><span class="nm">4.</span><span class="cl">Answer:</span> The case is, he is a Nazir Shimshon (which cannot be annulled).</p>
<p class="bas indent2"><span class="nm">5.</span><span class="cl">Objection:</span> A Nazir Shimshon may become Tamei!</p>
<p class="bas indent1"><span class="nm">(q)</span><span class="cl">Answer #2 (to Question #8):</span> The Tana holds that Isur Kolel does not take effect. (Normally, another Isur does not take effect on something already forbidden. Some say that it does if it is Kolel, i.e. it also forbids things that were permitted, therefore, it takes effect also on what was already Asur. Our Tana disagrees. Therefore, the oath not to plow on Chol takes effect, but it does not take effect regarding Yom Tov. Answer (o) is not true, so R. Mani's objection answers Question #8.)</p>
<p class="bas indent1"><span class="nm">(r)</span><span class="cl">(R. Hoshaya):</span> One who mates a blemished Korban (after it was redeemed) is lashed (even if he mates it with its own species. It is like two species, Chulin (one may eat it, like Chulin) and Kodshim (one may not shear it or work with it). Therefore, one is lashed for crossbreeding diverse species. Our text says that he is lashed twice. Mating is considered work, so he is lashed also for working with a blemished Korban. Many delete this from the text.)</p>
<p class="bas indent1"><span class="nm">(s)</span><span class="cl">(R. Yitzchak):</span> One who conducts (works with) a blemished Korban (after it was redeemed) is lashed (for working with diverse species);</p>
<p class="bas indent2"><span class="nm">1.</span>Even though it is one animal, the Torah considers it like two species.</p>
<p class="bas subject"><span class="nm">2)</span>THE TOTAL NUMBER OF LASHES</p>
<p class="bas indent1"><span class="nm">(a)</span><span class="cl">(Mishnah):</span> One who is lashed receives 39 lashes. "B'Mispar Arba'im" means the number followed by 40;</p>
<p class="bas indent1"><span class="nm">(b)</span>R. Yehudah says, he receives a full 40 lashes;</p>
<p class="bas indent2"><span class="nm">1.</span>(The Mishnah on 22B teaches that the lashes are evenly divided among three places.) The extra (40th) lash is between his shoulders.</p>
<p class="bas indent1"><span class="nm">(c)</span>We estimate (how many lashes he can survive) only a number divisible by three.</p>
<p class="bas indent1"><span class="nm">(d)</span>If we estimated that he can survive 40 (really, 39) and after he was lashed some of them we estimate that he cannot bear them, he is exempt (for he was already humiliated).</p>
<p class="bas bbbline">22b----------------------------------------22b</p>
<p class="bas indent1"><span class="nm">(e)</span>If we estimated that he can survive 18, and after he was lashed 18 we estimate that he can bear 40, he is exempt.</p>
<p class="bas indent1"><span class="nm">(f)</span><span class="cl">(Gemara) Question:</span> What is the reason (why he gets only 39 lashes)?</p>
<p class="bas indent1"><span class="nm">(g)</span><span class="cl">Answer:</span> Had it said 'Arba'im b'Mispar', we would say that it means 40;</p>
<p class="bas indent2"><span class="nm">1.</span>Instead, it says "b'Mispar Arba'im", i.e. the number followed by 40.</p>
<p class="bas indent1"><span class="nm">(h)</span><span class="cl">(Rava):</span> Most people are foolish. They stand for a Sefer Torah, but not for Chachamim;</p>
<p class="bas indent2"><span class="nm">1.</span>The Torah says to give 40 lashes, and Chachamim expounded that it is only 39!</p>
<p class="bas indent1"><span class="nm">(i)</span><span class="cl">(Mishnah - R. Yehudah):</span> He receives a full 40 lashes (the extra lash is between his shoulders).</p>
<p class="bas indent1"><span class="nm">(j)</span><span class="cl">(R. Yitzchak):</span> R. Yehudah learns from "Mah ha'Makos he'Eleh Bein Yadecha v'Amar Asher Hukeisi Beis Me'ahavai" (Ritva - the extra lash is between his arms; Aruch l'Ner - 39 lashes are for the sin, the extra one arouses Hash-m's love for him);</p>
<p class="bas indent2"><span class="nm">1.</span>Chachamim explain that this discusses a Rebbi lashing children.</p>
<p class="bas indent1"><span class="nm">(k)</span><span class="cl">(Mishnah):</span> ... (After he was lashed some, we estimate that he cannot bear them, he is exempt).</p>
<p class="bas indent1"><span class="nm">(l)</span><span class="cl">Inference:</span> He is exempt because he already received some lashes.</p>
<p class="bas indent1"><span class="nm">(m)</span><span class="cl">Contradiction (Beraisa):</span> If we estimated that he can survive 40, then we estimated that he cannot bear 40, he is exempt;</p>
<p class="bas indent2"><span class="nm">1.</span>If we estimated that he can survive 18, and then we estimated that he can bear 40, he is exempt.</p>
<p class="bas indent1"><span class="nm">(n)</span><span class="cl">Resolution (Rav Ashi):</span> In the Mishnah, the second estimation was the same day. Surely, he did not change! Rather, the first estimation was a mistake, so he is not exempt until he is lashed;</p>
<p class="bas indent2"><span class="nm">1.</span>In the Beraisa, the second estimation was on another day. Presumably, our estimation was proper, but he became weaker. He was already humiliated through the first estimation, so he is exempt.</p>
<p class="bas indent1"><span class="nm">(o)</span><span class="cl">(Mishnah):</span> If one transgressed something forbidden by two Lavim:</p>
<p class="bas indent2"><span class="nm">1.</span>If one estimation was made for both Lavim, he receives that amount, and he is exempt;</p>
<p class="bas indent2"><span class="nm">2.</span>If the estimation was made for one Lav, he receives that amount. After he recovers, we estimate and lash him for the other.</p>
<p class="bas indent1"><span class="nm">(p)</span><span class="cl">(Gemara - Beraisa) Contradiction:</span> We do not make one estimation for two Lavim.</p>
<p class="bas indent1"><span class="nm">(q)</span><span class="cl">Resolution (Rav Sheshes):</span> An estimation of at most 41 does not exempt two Lavim (for he only receives 39, the multiple of three before this, just like he would for one Lav);</p>
<p class="bas indent2"><span class="nm">1.</span>An estimation of at least 42 exempts two Lavim.</p>
<p class="bas subject"><span class="nm">3)</span>HOW WE LASH</p>
<p class="bas indent1"><span class="nm">(a)</span><span class="cl">(Mishnah):</span> To lash (Reuven), we lean him on a post and tie his hands to it;</p>
<p class="bas indent2"><span class="nm">1.</span>The overseer of Beis Din grabs him by his garments. He is not concerned whether they tear on the seams or elsewhere. He tears until his chest is exposed.</p>
<p class="bas indent1"><span class="nm">(b)</span>The overseer stands on a rock, holding a (Me'iri; Rivan - two) calf-skin strap(s) folded into four. Two straps (of donkey skin) are attached.</p>
<p class="bas indent1"><span class="nm">(c)</span>The whip handle is a Tefach, the width of the whip is a Tefach, and the end (wraps around the width (Rivan; Ritva - the length) of Reuven's back and) reaches his stomach.</p>
<p class="bas indent1"><span class="nm">(d)</span>One third of the lashes are on the stomach, and two thirds are on the back (Ritva - in the middle; Rambam - one third on each shoulder).</p>
<p class="bas indent1"><span class="nm">(e)</span>He is not lashed standing, nor sitting, rather, leaning - "v'Hipilu ha'Shofet."</p>
<p class="bas indent1"><span class="nm">(f)</span>The one lashing lashes with one hand, with all his strength. Another reads "Im Lo Sishmor... v'Hifla Hash-m Es Makosecha" , and repeats it.</p>
<p class="bas indent1"><span class="nm">(g)</span>If Reuven dies, the overseer is exempt. If he died from an extra lash, the overseer is exiled.</p>
<p class="bas indent1"><span class="nm">(h)</span>If Reuven urinated or excreted (Rambam - from the lashes, and not from fear beforehand), he is exempt (for he was humiliated);</p>
<p class="bas indent1"><span class="nm">(i)</span>R. Yehudah says, a man is exempt if he excreted. A woman is exempt if she urinated or excreted.</p>
