<p class="bas subject"><span class="nm">1)</span><i>ME'ILAH</i> FOR CHANGING <i>RESHUS</i></p>
<p class="bas indent1"><span class="nm">(a)</span><span class="cl">(Mishnah):</span> If Reuven took a rock or beam of Hekdesh, he was not Mo'el;</p>
<p class="bas indent1"><span class="nm">(b)</span>If he gave it to Shimon, Reuven was Mo'el, but Shimon was not Mo'el.</p>
<p class="bas indent1"><span class="nm">(c)</span>If Reuven (kept it and) built it into his house, he is not Mo'el until he gets a Perutah's worth of benefit from it through living in the house.</p>
<p class="bas indent1"><span class="nm">(d)</span>If Reuven took a Perutah of Hekdesh, he was not Mo'el;</p>
<p class="bas indent1"><span class="nm">(e)</span>If he gave it to Shimon, he was Mo'el, but Shimon was not;</p>
<p class="bas indent1"><span class="nm">(f)</span>If he gave it to a bathhouse attendant (to pay for a bath he will take), he is Mo'el immediately, even before he bathes, for he may bathe whenever he wants.</p>
<p class="bas indent1"><span class="nm">(g)</span>What Reuven eats or benefits from joins with what (he gave to Shimon and) Shimon eats or benefits from to obligate Reuven for Me'ilah, even over a long period of time.</p>
<p class="bas indent1"><span class="nm">(h)</span><span class="cl">(Gemara) Question:</span> When Reuven takes Hekdesh there is no Me'ilah. Why is there Me'ilah when he gives it to Shimon?</p>
<p class="bas indent1"><span class="nm">(i)</span><span class="cl">Answer (Shmuel):</span> The case is, Reuven is a Gizbar (treasurer of Hekdesh) who oversees the objects of Hekdesh. (As long as he has it, it did not leave the Reshus of Hekdesh. Ra'avad - every person is considered the Gizbar over what he was Makdish until the Gizbar of Hekdesh receives it).</p>
<p class="bas indent1"><span class="nm">(j)</span><span class="cl">(Mishnah):</span> If he built it into his house, he is not Mo'el until...</p>
<p class="bas indent1"><span class="nm">(k)</span><span class="cl">Question:</span> He should be Mo'el right away, for he changed it (e.g. smoothed it, or cut it to size) in order to build it into his house!</p>
<p class="bas indent1"><span class="nm">(l)</span><span class="cl">Answer (Rav):</span> (He did not change it.) He merely affixed it on top of a skylight (opening in the roof).</p>
<p class="bas indent1"><span class="nm">(m)</span><span class="cl">Version #1 (Tosfos) Inference:</span> After building it into his house, Me'ilah applies to it. (Me'ilah does not apply to anything attached. We must say that a house is not considered attached, for it was initially detached.)</p>
<p class="bas indent2"><span class="nm">1.</span>This supports Rav, who says that if one bowed to (worshipped) a house, it becomes forbidden (even though attached things do not become forbidden due to idolatry)!</p>
<p class="bas indent1"><span class="nm">(n)</span><span class="cl">Rejection (Rav Acha brei d'Rav Ika):</span> (Really, a house is considered attached;)</p>
<p class="bas indent2"><span class="nm">1.</span>Because the skylight cover is visible from the outside, Me'ilah applies to it. (Pirush Kadmon (B) - since the beam was Hekdesh before it was attached, mid'Rabanan) we are concerned for Mar'is Ayin. (People might think that there is Me'ilah.)</p>
<p class="bas indent1"><span class="nm">(o)</span><span class="cl">Version #2 (R. Gershom) Inference:</span> Even after building it into his house, he is not Mo'el until he benefits from it. (We do not say that attaching it is a change. We must say that a house is not considered attached).</p>
<p class="bas indent2"><span class="nm">1.</span>This supports Rav, who says that if one bowed to a house, it becomes forbidden.</p>
<p class="bas indent1"><span class="nm">(p)</span><span class="cl">Rejection (Rav Acha brei d'Rav Ika):</span> Really, a house is considered attached. Me'ilah applies only to blatant benefit. (end of Version #2)</p>
<p class="bas indent1"><span class="nm">(q)</span><span class="cl">Support (for Rav's law about idolatry - Beraisa):</span> If one lived in a Hekdesh house and benefited from it, he was Mo'el.</p>
<p class="bas indent1"><span class="nm">(r)</span><span class="cl">Rejection (Reish Lakish):</span> (Really, a house is considered attached.) The Beraisa discusses a house made from Hekdesh materials.</p>
<p class="bas indent1"><span class="nm">(s)</span><span class="cl">Question:</span> This implies that if it was made from Chulin and then made Hekdesh, Me'ilah would not apply;</p>
<p class="bas indent2"><span class="nm">1.</span>If so, why does the Seifa say that if one lived in a (Hekdesh) cave and benefited, he was not Mo'el? Even regarding a house (which was initially detached), Me'ilah does not apply to it if it was Hukdash after it was built!</p>
<p class="bas indent1"><span class="nm">(t)</span><span class="cl">Answer:</span> The Tana prefers to teach a uniform law. (Me'ilah never applies to a cave.) The law of a house is not uniform.</p>
<p class="perekline">PEREK HA'SHALI'ACH</p>
<p class="bas subject"><span class="nm">2)</span>DEVIATION FROM <i>SHELICHUS</i></p>
<p class="bas indent1"><span class="nm">(a)</span><span class="cl">(Mishnah):</span> If a Shali'ach fulfilled his mission (and caused a loss to Hekdesh), the sender was Mo'el. If he did not fulfill his mission, he was Mo'el.</p>
<p class="bas indent1"><span class="nm">(b)</span>For example, if Reuven told Shimon to give meat to guests, and Shimon gave liver, or vice-versa, (and the meat was found to be Hekdesh,) Shimon was Mo'el;</p>
<p class="bas indent1"><span class="nm">(c)</span>If he told him "give one piece of meat to each guest," and Shimon told the guests to take two each, and the guests took three each (and the meat was found to be Hekdesh), Reuven, Shimon and the guests were all Mo'el.</p>
<p class="bas bbbline">20b----------------------------------------20b</p>
<p class="bas indent1"><span class="nm">(d)</span><span class="cl">(Gemara) Question:</span> (Meat and liver are similar enough that if a Shali'ach was asked to buy meat, and found only liver, he would ask the sender if he wants liver. Nevertheless, the Mishnah says that Shimon was Mo'el, i.e. it is considered that he did not fulfill his mission.) Who is the Tana of the Mishnah, who says that if a Shali'ach was told to buy "A," and he would ask before substituting "B" for it, this shows that "B" is considered a different species than "A"?</p>
<p class="bas indent1"><span class="nm">(e)</span><span class="cl">Answer #1 (Rav Chisda):</span> It is unlike R. Akiva:</p>
<p class="bas indent2"><span class="nm">1.</span><span class="cl">(Mishnah):</span> If one vowed not to eat vegetables, gourds are permitted to him;</p>
<p class="bas indent2"><span class="nm">2.</span>R. Akiva forbids. (Chachamim permit because if a Shali'ach was sent to buy vegetables and found only gourds, he would ask the sender before buying them. R. Akiva says this shows that gourds <i>are</i> in the category of vegetables. He would not ask whether he should buy legumes!)</p>
<p class="bas indent1"><span class="nm">(f)</span><span class="cl">Answer #2 (Abaye):</span> The Mishnah can be R. Akiva. R. Akiva agrees that the Shali'ach must ask the sender! (Since he did not ask, he acted on his own accord. Pirush Kadmon (B) - mid'Oraisa, R. Akiva admits that they are different species. Regarding vows, he is stringent mid'Rabanan.)</p>
<p class="bas indent1"><span class="nm">(g)</span><span class="cl">(Rava):</span> Abaye is correct.</p>
<p class="bas indent1"><span class="nm">(h)</span><span class="cl">Question:</span> Who are the Chachamim who argue with R. Akiva?</p>
<p class="bas indent1"><span class="nm">(i)</span><span class="cl">Answer:</span> They hold like R. Shimon ben Gamliel:</p>
<p class="bas indent2"><span class="nm">1.</span><span class="cl">(Beraisa):</span> If one vowed not to eat meat, all types of meat are forbidden to him -- the head, legs, chest, innards, liver, heart, and fowl;</p>
<p class="bas indent3"><span class="nm">i.</span>Fish and grasshoppers are permitted.</p>
<p class="bas indent2"><span class="nm">2.</span>R. Shimon ben Gamliel permits the head, legs, innards, liver, heart, and fowl (and fish and grasshoppers. Shitah deletes this.)</p>
<p class="bas indent2"><span class="nm">3.</span><span class="cl">R. Shimon ben Gamliel:</span> The innards are not considered meat. One who eats them (even though he could buy other meat for the same price) is not a (normal) person.</p>
<p class="bas indent1"><span class="nm">(j)</span><span class="cl">Question:</span> Presumably, the first Tana forbids fowl because a Shali'ach would ask whether he should buy it in place of meat;</p>
<p class="bas indent2"><span class="nm">1.</span>He would also ask whether he should buy fish in place of meat. Also it should be forbidden!</p>
<p class="bas indent1"><span class="nm">(k)</span><span class="cl">Answer #1 (Rav Papa):</span> The Beraisa discusses a vow on the day of bloodletting. One does not eat fish that day. (One who vows intends to forbid only foods that he might want to eat that day.)</p>
<p class="bas indent1"><span class="nm">(l)</span><span class="cl">Objection:</span> If so, the same should apply to fowl!</p>
<p class="bas indent2"><span class="nm">1.</span><span class="cl">(Shmuel):</span> If one let blood and eats fowl, his heart will flutter like a bird.</p>
<p class="bas indent2"><span class="nm">2.</span><span class="cl">(Beraisa):</span> One does not eat fish, fowl or salted meat on the day he lets blood.</p>
<p class="bas indent1"><span class="nm">(m)</span><span class="cl">Answer #2 (Rav Papa):</span> His eyes were hurting when he vowed (one does not eat fish then).</p>
<p class="bas indent1"><span class="nm">(n)</span><span class="cl">(Mishnah):</span> If he told him "give one piece... "</p>
<p class="bas indent1"><span class="nm">(o)</span><span class="cl">Inference:</span> When a Shali'ach does more than he was told, he fulfills the Shelichus and adds to it. (We do not say that he uprooted the Shelichus and acted on his own accord.)</p>
<p class="bas indent1"><span class="nm">(p)</span><span class="cl">Rejection (Rav Sheshes):</span> No, the case is, Shimon explicitly said "take one piece due to Reuven, and one due to me";</p>
<p class="bas indent2"><span class="nm">1.</span>One might have thought that he uprooted the Shelichus and Reuven is not Mo'el. The Mishnah teaches that this is not so.</p>
