<p class="bas subject"><span class="nm">1)</span>BOTH <i>LAVIN</i> APPLY TO BOTH</p>
<p class="bas indent1"><span class="nm">(a)</span><span class="cl">(Beraisa):</span> "Es Kaspecha Lo Siten Lo b'Neshech uv'Marbis Lo Siten Ochlecha" - we find only Neshech regarding money, and only Tarbis regarding food;</p>
<p class="bas indent1"><span class="nm">(b)</span><span class="cl">Question:</span> What is the source that Neshech applies also to food?</p>
<p class="bas indent1"><span class="nm">(c)</span><span class="cl">Answer #1:</span> It says "Neshech Ochel."</p>
<p class="bas indent1"><span class="nm">(d)</span><span class="cl">Question:</span> What is the source that Tarbis applies also to money?</p>
<p class="bas indent1"><span class="nm">(e)</span><span class="cl">Answer #1:</span> We could have learned Neshech of money (regarding the borrower) had it said "Lo Tashich... (anything that bites)." "Neshech Kesef" is extra to teach Tarbis of money.</p>
<p class="bas indent2"><span class="nm">1.</span><span class="cl">Question:</span> These are written about the borrower. What is the source that the lender also transgresses Neshech of food and Tarbis of money?</p>
<p class="bas indent2"><span class="nm">2.</span><span class="cl">Answer:</span> We learn a Gezeirah Shavah "Neshech-Neshech" - just like regarding the borrower, both Lavim apply to both, also regarding the lender.</p>
<p class="bas indent2"><span class="nm">3.</span><span class="cl">Question:</span> What is the source to include everything else (as well as money and food)?</p>
<p class="bas indent2"><span class="nm">4.</span><span class="cl">Answer:</span> We learn from "Neshech Kol Davar Asher Yishach."</p>
<p class="bas indent1"><span class="nm">(f)</span><span class="cl">Answer #2 (to questions (b) and (d) - Ravina):</span> We already learn Neshech of food and Tarbis of money from "Es Kaspecha Lo Siten Lo b'Neshech uv'Marbis Lo Siten Ochlecha."</p>
<p class="bas indent2"><span class="nm">1.</span>Indeed, had it said 'Es Kaspecha Lo Siten Lo b'Neshech v'Ochlecha b'Tarbis', we would need another source;</p>
<p class="bas indent2"><span class="nm">2.</span>The verse reversed the order, in order that we expound "Es Kaspecha Lo Siten Lo b'Neshech uv'Marbis" (both apply to money), and "b'Neshech uv'Marbis Lo Siten Ochlecha" (both apply to food).</p>
<p class="bas indent1"><span class="nm">(g)</span><span class="cl">Question:</span> The Tana learns from a Gezeirah Shavah!</p>
<p class="bas indent1"><span class="nm">(h)</span><span class="cl">Answer:</span> The Tana teaches that had the verse not put Neshech and Tarbis next to each other, we could have learned from the Gezeirah Shavah;</p>
<p class="bas indent2"><span class="nm">1.</span>Since Neshech and Tarbis are written next to each other, we do not need the Gezeirah Shavah.</p>
<p class="bas indent1"><span class="nm">(i)</span><span class="cl">Question:</span> What does the Gezeirah Shavah teach?</p>
<p class="bas indent1"><span class="nm">(j)</span><span class="cl">Answer:</span> It teaches that "Neshech Kol Davar Asher Yishach" (everything else) applies to the lender, for this was written only regarding the borrower.</p>
<p class="bas subject"><span class="nm">2)</span>THE <i>LAVIM</i> OF ROBBERY</p>
<p class="bas indent1"><span class="nm">(a)</span><span class="cl">Question (Rava):</span> Why must the Torah write Lavim forbidding Ribis, robbery and Ona'ah?</p>
<p class="bas indent1"><span class="nm">(b)</span><span class="cl">Answer (Rava):</span> It must teach all three:</p>
<p class="bas indent2"><span class="nm">1.</span>Had it taught only Ribis, we could not learn to the others, for Ribis is a Chidush. The borrower is forbidden to give!</p>
<p class="bas indent2"><span class="nm">2.</span>Had it taught only robbery, that which is (totally) against the will of the victim, we could not learn to Ona'ah, in which the victim (buys or sells) willingly.</p>
<p class="bas indent2"><span class="nm">3.</span>Had it taught only Ona'ah, we could not learn to the others, for a victim of Ona'ah does not know he was cheated, so he cannot pardon it. Regarding the others, the victim can pardon his loss.</p>
<p class="bas indent1"><span class="nm">(c)</span><span class="cl">Suggestion:</span> We cannot learn the others from one. Perhaps we could learn one from the other two!</p>
<p class="bas indent1"><span class="nm">(d)</span><span class="cl">Question:</span> Which could we learn from the others?</p>
<p class="bas indent2"><span class="nm">1.</span>We could not learn Ribis, for the victim willingly gives his money!</p>
<p class="bas indent2"><span class="nm">2.</span>We could not learn Ona'ah, for one might have thought that it is normal to overcharge or undercharge in commerce;</p>
<p class="bas indent1"><span class="nm">(e)</span><span class="cl">Answer:</span> We could learn robbery.</p>
<p class="bas indent2"><span class="nm">1.</span>We could not learn from Ribis (alone), because it is a Chidush. Ona'ah is not a Chidush, we can learn from it!</p>
<p class="bas indent2"><span class="nm">2.</span>We could not learn from Ona'ah (alone), because the victim does not know he was cheated. We can learn from Ribis, in which the victim knows what he paid!</p>
<p class="bas indent2"><span class="nm">3.</span>The stringency of each is unlike the stringency of the other. What is common to both is that he steals. We can learn to robbery!</p>
<p class="bas indent1"><span class="nm">(f)</span><span class="cl">Question:</span> If so, why did the Torah write a Lav regarding robbery?</p>
<p class="bas indent1"><span class="nm">(g)</span><span class="cl">Answer:</span> It forbids withholding wages.</p>
<p class="bas indent1"><span class="nm">(h)</span><span class="cl">Question:</span> There is a Lav for withholding wages - "Lo Sa'asok Sachir"!</p>
<p class="bas indent1"><span class="nm">(i)</span><span class="cl">Answer:</span> The Lav of robbery is a second Lav forbidding withholding wages.</p>
<p class="bas indent1"><span class="nm">(j)</span><span class="cl">Question:</span> We can say that it is a second Lav for Ribis and Ona'ah!</p>
<p class="bas indent1"><span class="nm">(k)</span><span class="cl">Answer:</span> We learn it from context. The Torah wrote it regarding a worker.</p>
<p class="bas bbbline">61b----------------------------------------61b</p>
<p class="bas indent1"><span class="nm">(l)</span><span class="cl">Question:</span> What do we learn from "Lo Signovu"?</p>
<p class="bas indent1"><span class="nm">(m)</span><span class="cl">Answer (Beraisa):</span> "Lo Signovu" one may not steal with intent to (give back, and in the interim) cause pain, or in order to pay Kefel.</p>
<p class="bas subject"><span class="nm">3)</span>FALSE WEIGHTS AND MEASURES</p>
<p class="bas indent1"><span class="nm">(a)</span><span class="cl">Question (Rav Yemar):</span> Why did the Torah need to write a Lav for (false) weights?</p>
<p class="bas indent1"><span class="nm">(b)</span><span class="cl">Answer (Rav Ashi):</span> This forbids putting one's weights in salt (Rashi - to make them heavier, to get more when buying; R. Tam - to make them lighter, to give less when selling).</p>
<p class="bas indent1"><span class="nm">(c)</span><span class="cl">Objection:</span> That is pure robbery, no extra verse is needed!</p>
<p class="bas indent1"><span class="nm">(d)</span><span class="cl">Answer:</span> One transgresses the Lav of weights from the time he puts them in salt, even before he uses them.</p>
<p class="bas indent1"><span class="nm">(e)</span><span class="cl">(Beraisa):</span> "Avel b'Mishpat b'Midah" refers to measuring land;</p>
<p class="bas indent2"><span class="nm">1.</span>If land should be divided equally, one may not measure to one party in winter (Rashi - when the rope is moist and stretches out properly; R. Chananel - when the land contracts) and to the other party in summer.</p>
<p class="bas indent2"><span class="nm">2.</span>"B'Mishkal" forbids putting one's weights in salt;</p>
<p class="bas indent2"><span class="nm">3.</span>"Uva'Mesurah" - one who sells wine may not make it foam (to make it look like the buyer's Kli is full).</p>
<p class="bas indent3"><span class="nm">i.</span>We may learn a Kal va'Chomer. Mesurah is a tiny measure, a 36th of a Log, yet the Torah warns about it. All the more so, one may not steal a larger measure!</p>
<p class="bas indent1"><span class="nm">(f)</span><span class="cl">Question (Rava):</span> Why does the Torah mention Yetzi'as Mitzrayim regarding Ribis, Tzitzis, and weights?</p>
<p class="bas indent1"><span class="nm">(g)</span><span class="cl">Answer (Rava):</span> Just like in Mitzrayim, Hash-m knew everyone's true father to kill the firstborns, Hash-m knows (and will punish) one who falsely claims that his money belongs to a non-Jew in order to lend it with Ribis, one who puts his weights in salt, and one who uses blue tree sap to (cheaply) feign the Mitzvah of putting threads dyed with Techeiles on the corners of his garment.</p>
<p class="bas indent1"><span class="nm">(h)</span><span class="cl">Question (Rav Chanina of Sura):</span> Why does the Torah mention Yetzi'as Mitzrayim regarding Sheratzim (vermin)?</p>
<p class="bas indent1"><span class="nm">(i)</span><span class="cl">Answer (Ravina):</span> Just like in Mitzrayim, Hash-m knew the fathers and killed the firstborns, Hash-m knows (and will punish) one who mixes innards of Tamei fish (mentioned in this Parshah) with those of Tahor fish and sells them to Yisrael.</p>
<p class="bas indent1"><span class="nm">(j)</span><span class="cl">Question (Rav Chanina of Sura):</span> My question was, why does the Torah say "ha'Ma'aleh" (who brings you up, from Mitzrayim) regarding Sheratzim?</p>
<p class="bas indent1"><span class="nm">(k)</span><span class="cl">Answer (Ravina - Beraisa - Tana d'Vei R. Yishmael):</span> The merit that Yisrael will not become Teme'im through Sheratzim sufficed for Hash-m to redeem them from Mitzrayim.</p>
<p class="bas indent1"><span class="nm">(l)</span><span class="cl">Question:</span> Is the reward for refraining from (eating) Sheratzim greater than that of refraining from Ribis and false weights and fulfilling Tzitzis?!</p>
<p class="bas indent1"><span class="nm">(m)</span><span class="cl">Answer:</span> Even though the reward is not greater, they are exceedingly disgusting to eat.</p>
<p class="bas subject"><span class="nm">4)</span>FIXED <i>RIBIS</i></p>
<p class="bas indent1"><span class="nm">(a)</span><span class="cl">(Mishnah):</span> What is Tarbis? It is one who increases Peros. If Reuven bought a Kor of wheat...</p>
<p class="bas indent1"><span class="nm">(b)</span><span class="cl">Question:</span> Also the previous examples were Tarbis! (We concluded that every case of Neshech is Tarbis.)</p>
<p class="bas indent1"><span class="nm">(c)</span><span class="cl">Answer (R. Avahu and Rava):</span> The previous cases were Ribis mid'Oraisa. The coming cases are mid'Rabanan;</p>
<p class="bas indent2"><span class="nm">1.</span>In the previous cases, "Yachin v'Tzadik Yilbash" (if the lender died, his heir may keep the Ribis).</p>
<p class="bas indent2"><span class="nm">2.</span><span class="cl">Question:</span> May we infer that in the later cases (mid'Rabanan Ribis), the heir must return it?!</p>
<p class="bas indent2"><span class="nm">3.</span><span class="cl">Correction:</span> Rather, <i>even</i> in the previous cases, the heir may keep it.</p>
<p class="bas indent2"><span class="nm">4.</span>The previous cases are fixed Ribis. The coming cases are Avak (dust of) Ribis.</p>
<p class="bas indent1"><span class="nm">(d)</span><span class="cl">(R. Elazar):</span> Beis Din forces the lender to return fixed Ribis, but not Avak Ribis.</p>
<p class="bas indent1"><span class="nm">(e)</span><span class="cl">(R. Yochanan):</span> Beis Din does not force the lender to return even fixed Ribis.</p>
<p class="bas indent1"><span class="nm">(f)</span><span class="cl">(Question:</span> What is R. Yochanan's source?)</p>
<p class="bas indent1"><span class="nm">(g)</span><span class="cl">Answer #1 (R. Yitzchak):</span> "Ba'Neshech Nasan v'Tarbis Lokach va'Chai Lo Yichyeh" - he will die (b'Yedei Shamayim). It will not help to return the Ribis.</p>
<p class="bas indent1"><span class="nm">(h)</span><span class="cl">Answer #2 (Rav Ada bar Ahavah):</span> "...V'Yoresa me'Elokecha" - one returns Ribis because he fears Hash-m. Beis Din does not force him.</p>
<p class="bas indent1"><span class="nm">(i)</span><span class="cl">Answer #3 (Rava):</span> He learns from the end of the first verse "(Lo Yichyeh) Mos Yumas Damav Bo," This equates those who lend on Ribis are compared to murderers;</p>
<p class="bas indent2"><span class="nm">1.</span>Just like one cannot undo murder, one cannot undo Ribis by returning it.</p>
