<p class="bas subject"><span class="nm">1)</span>A VOW FROM GRAIN</p>
<p class="bas indent1"><span class="nm">(a)</span><span class="cl">(Mishnah - R. Meir):</span> If one vowed from 'Dagan', he may not have dry Mitzri beans;</p>
<p class="bas indent1"><span class="nm">(b)</span>Chachamim say, he is forbidden only the five species (of grain, i.e. wheat, barley, oats, spelt, and rye).</p>
<p class="bas indent2"><span class="nm">1.</span><span class="cl">R. Meir:</span> If one vowed from Tevu'ah, he is forbidden only the five species, but if he vowed from Dagan, all is forbidden. He is permitted fruit (of trees) and Yerek.</p>
<p class="bas indent1"><span class="nm">(c)</span><span class="cl">(Gemara):</span> Inference: Dagan means anything which is NiDGaN (piled).</p>
<p class="bas indent1"><span class="nm">(d)</span><span class="cl">Question (Rav Yosef):</span> "When the matter spread, Bnei Yisrael brought many tithes - Dagan, wine, oil, and all Tevu'ah of the field."</p>
<p class="bas indent2"><span class="nm">1.</span>If Dagan means anything that is piled, this includes all Tevu'ah!</p>
<p class="bas indent1"><span class="nm">(e)</span><span class="cl">Answer:</span> "All Tevu'ah" comes to include fruits and Yerek.</p>
<p class="bas indent1"><span class="nm">(f)</span><span class="cl">(Mishnah):</span> R. Meir says, if one vowed from Tevu'ah...</p>
<p class="bas indent1"><span class="nm">(g)</span><span class="cl">(R. Yochanan):</span> Both Tana'im agree that if one vowed from Tevu'ah, only the five grains are forbidden.</p>
<p class="bas indent1"><span class="nm">(h)</span><span class="cl">Support (Beraisa):</span> They agree that if one vowed from Tevu'ah, only the five grains are forbidden.</p>
<p class="bas indent1"><span class="nm">(i)</span><span class="cl">Question:</span> This is obvious!</p>
<p class="bas indent1"><span class="nm">(j)</span><span class="cl">Answer:</span> One might have thought that 'Tevu'ah' includes everything. The Beraisa teaches that it does not.</p>
<p class="bas indent1"><span class="nm">(k)</span><span class="cl">Question (Rav Yosef):</span> "When the matter spread, Bnei Yisrael brought many tithes: Dagan, wine, oil, and all Tevu'ah of the field." (Dagan includes the five grains. Tevu'ah must refer to other things!)</p>
<p class="bas indent1"><span class="nm">(l)</span><span class="cl">Answer (Rava):</span> Tevu'ah is only the five grains. "Tevu'ah of the field" includes other things.</p>
<p class="bas subject"><span class="nm">2)</span>ALALTA</p>
<p class="bas indent1"><span class="nm">(a)</span>Shmuel's son commanded (before he died) to give 13,000 Zuz to Rava, from the Alalta (increase) of Nahar Panya.</p>
<p class="bas indent1"><span class="nm">(b)</span><span class="cl">Question (Rava):</span> What is considered Alalta?</p>
<p class="bas indent1"><span class="nm">(c)</span><span class="cl">Answer (Rav Yosef - Beraisa):</span> They agree that if one vowed from Tevu'ah, only the five grains are forbidden. (the Aramaic translation of Tevu'ah is Alalta.)</p>
<p class="bas indent1"><span class="nm">(d)</span><span class="cl">Objection (Abaye):</span> This does not answer the question! Tevu'ah connotes only the five grains, but Alalta includes everything!</p>
<p class="bas indent1"><span class="nm">(e)</span><span class="cl">Rava (after hearing the answer):</span> I knew that Alalta includes all that grows. My question was whether rental of houses and ships is included.</p>
<p class="bas indent2"><span class="nm">1.</span>Perhaps since houses and ships depreciate, this is not considered increase;</p>
<p class="bas indent2"><span class="nm">2.</span>Or, since the depreciation is not discernible (in the short run), it is considered increase.</p>
<p class="bas indent1"><span class="nm">(f)</span>Rav Yosef received Rava's clarification of his question; he was upset. 'If he knows himself, why did he ask us?'</p>
<p class="bas indent1"><span class="nm">(g)</span>Rava came to Rav Yosef on Erev Yom Kipur (to ask forgiveness). He found Rav Yosef's attendant mixing wine for Rav Yosef (who was blind), and volunteered to mix the wine himself.</p>
<p class="bas indent1"><span class="nm">(h)</span><span class="cl">Rav Yosef (after tasting the wine):</span> This is how Rava mixes wine! (Most used to dilute one measure of wine with two measures of water. Rava added three measures of water.)</p>
<p class="bas indent2"><span class="nm">1.</span><span class="cl">Rava:</span> Yes, it is me.</p>
<p class="bas indent2"><span class="nm">2.</span><span class="cl">Rav Yosef:</span> Explain to me the verse "From Midbar (to) Matanah, and from Matanah (to) Nachli'el, and from Nachli'el (to) Bamos."</p>
<p class="bas indent2"><span class="nm">3.</span><span class="cl">Rava:</span> When a person makes himself Hefker to all, like a Midbar (wilderness), Torah is given to him for a Matanah (gift). When he receives a gift of Torah, it is like a Nachalah (inheritance) to him. Once it is like an inheritance to him, he rises to Bamos (a high position).</p>
<p class="bas indent3"><span class="nm">i.</span>If he raises himself (becomes haughty), Hash-m lowers him - "And from Bamos (to) ha'Gai (the valley)"; further, he will be stuck in the ground - "v'Nishkafah (this is like Iskufa, a threshold that is trampled on) on the face of ha'Yeshimon";</p>
<p class="bas indent3"><span class="nm">ii.</span>If he repents (from his haughtiness), Hash-m raises him - "Every Gai will be raised."</p>

<p class="bas subject"><span class="nm">3)</span>IF ONE VOWED FROM <i>PEROS</i></p>
<p class="bas indent1"><span class="nm">(a)</span><span class="cl">(Beraisa):</span> If one vowed from Dagan, he is forbidden even dry Mitzri beans. Moist beans are permitted;</p>
<p class="bas indent2"><span class="nm">1.</span>He is permitted rice, and wheat cut into two, three, or four pieces.</p>
<p class="bas indent1"><span class="nm">(b)</span>If one vowed from Peros of the year, he is forbidden all Peros that grow in the year. He is permitted kids, lambs, milk, eggs and chicks;</p>
<p class="bas indent2"><span class="nm">1.</span>If he forbade 'growth of the year', all of these are forbidden.</p>
<p class="bas indent1"><span class="nm">(c)</span>If one vowed from Peros of the land, all that grows from the land is forbidden. Mushrooms and truffles are permitted;</p>
<p class="bas indent2"><span class="nm">1.</span>If he said 'what grows from the ground', all of them (even mushrooms and truffles) are forbidden.</p>
<p class="bas indent1"><span class="nm">(d)</span><span class="cl">Contradiction (Mishnah):</span> The Berachah on something that does not grow from the ground is 'sheha'Kol Nihyeh bi'Dvaro';</p>
<p class="bas indent2"><span class="nm">1.</span>A Beraisa teaches that one blesses sheha'Kol on salt, brine, mushrooms and truffles!</p>
<p class="bas indent1"><span class="nm">(e)</span><span class="cl">Answer (Abaye):</span> Mushrooms and truffles grow from the ground, but they nurture from the air, not from the ground.</p>
<p class="bas indent1"><span class="nm">(f)</span><span class="cl">Question:</span> The Mishnah discusses 'something that does not grow from the ground'!</p>
<p class="bas indent1"><span class="nm">(g)</span><span class="cl">Answer:</span> It means, something that does not nurture from the ground.</p>
<p class="bas subject"><span class="nm">4)</span>IF ONE VOWED FROM CLOTHING</p>
<p class="bas indent1"><span class="nm">(a)</span><span class="cl">(Mishnah):</span> If one vowed from clothing, he is permitted sackcloth, a curtain, and a blanket;</p>
<p class="bas indent2"><span class="nm">1.</span>If he said 'wool will not come on me', he may cover himself with tufts of wool;</p>
<p class="bas indent2"><span class="nm">2.</span>If he said 'linen will not come on me', he may cover himself with tufts of flax;</p>
<p class="bas indent1"><span class="nm">(b)</span>R. Yehudah says, it depends on (the situation of) the one who vowed:</p>
<p class="bas indent2"><span class="nm">1.</span>If he was carrying (wool and linen) and he was sweating and stinking, and said 'wool and linen will not come on me', he may wear them, but he may not carry them on his back.</p>
<p class="bas indent1"><span class="nm">(c)</span><span class="cl">(Gemara - Beraisa):</span> If one vowed from clothing, he is permitted sackcloth, curtains and blankets; he is forbidden a hollow belt, a belt that goes around the legs, a Skortya, a leather overgarment, socks, an apron, pants, and a hat.</p>
<p class="bas indent1"><span class="nm">(d)</span><span class="cl">Question:</span> What is Iskorti (Skortya)?</p>
<p class="bas indent1"><span class="nm">(e)</span><span class="cl">Answer (Rabah bar bar Chanah):</span> It is a leather garment.</p>
<p class="bas indent1"><span class="nm">(f)</span><span class="cl">(Beraisa):</span> To shield oneself from rain, one may wear (in a Reshus ha'Rabim on Shabbos) a garment thick like sackcloth, a curtain, or a blanket, but he may not go with a box or basket or mattress;</p>
<p class="bas indent2"><span class="nm">1.</span>Shepherds may go in sackcloth;</p>
<p class="bas indent2"><span class="nm">2.</span>Anyone is allowed. Chachamim discussed a typical case.</p>
<p class="bas indent1"><span class="nm">(g)</span><span class="cl">(Mishnah - R. Yehudah):</span> It depends on the one who vowed...</p>
<p class="bas indent1"><span class="nm">(h)</span><span class="cl">(Beraisa - R. Yehudah):</span> Everything depends on the one who vowed:</p>
<p class="bas indent2"><span class="nm">1.</span>If he was suffering because he was wearing wool, and vowed 'Wool will not come upon me', he may not wear it, but he may carry it;</p>
<p class="bas indent2"><span class="nm">2.</span>If he was carrying flax and sweating, and said 'flax will not come upon me', he may wear it, but he may not carry it.</p>
