<p class=newsubafdaf><span class=numt>1)</span> BEING REBUKED</p>
<p class=firstindent><span class=numl1>(a)</span><span class=desl1>	(Mishnah):</span> The one appointed over Har ha'Bayis would probe everyone guarding; torches went in front of him. If someone did not greet him, this shows that he was sleeping, the appointee would hit him with his stick, and was allowed to burn his clothes.</p>
<p class=secondindent><span class=numl2>1.</span>	People who would hear someone screaming could infer that a Levi was being beaten for sleeping.</p>
<p class=firstindent><span class=numl1>(b)</span>	R. Eliezer ben Yakov says, once my uncle slept, and they burned his clothes.</p>
<p class=firstindent><span class=numl1>(c)</span><span class=desl1>	(R. Yochanan):</span> The earlier ones were fortunate. They would be punished (in this world) even for Ones of (being overcome by) sleep. All the more so, they would be punished for sleeping (R. Gershom; Mefaresh - sinning) without Ones!</p>
<p class=firstindent><span class=numl1>(d)</span><span class=desl1>	(Beraisa - Rebbi):</span> The proper path one should choose is to love (Maharsha - giving) rebuke, for pleasantness, good and blessing come to the world when there is rebuke -- "vela'Mochichim Yin'am va'Aleihem Tavo Virchas Tov."</p>
<p class=firstindent><span class=numl1>(e)</span>	Some say, he should conduct with extra Emunah -- "Einai b'Ne'emnei Eretz Lasheves Imadi."</p>
<p class=firstindent><span class=numl1>(f)</span><span class=desl1>	(R. Shmuel bar Nachmani):</span> One who rebukes someone l'Shem Shamayim merits Hashem's portion -- "Mochi'ach Adam Acharai";</p>
<p class=secondindent><span class=numl2>1.</span>	Furthermore, a string of Chesed is drawn over him -- "Chen Yimtza mi'Machalik Lashon."</p>
<p class=newsubject><span class=numt>2)</span> TERUMAS HA'DESHEN</p>
<p class=firstindent><span class=numl1>(a)</span>	(Mishnah):... One who wants to take the ashes off the Mizbe'ach (Terumas ha'Deshen)...</p>
<p class=firstindent><span class=numl1>(b)</span>	Inference: "One who <i>wants</i> to perform Terumas ha'Deshen immerses before the appointee comes" implies that a lottery is not needed.</p>
<p class=firstindent><span class=numl1>(c)</span>	Contradiction: The Mishnah continues "(whoever wants) let him come to the lottery!"</p>
<p class=firstindent><span class=numl1>(d)</span><span class=desl1>	Answer #1 (Abaye):</span> The Reisha applied before the following enactment. The Seifa applies after the enactment.</p>
<p class=secondindent><span class=numl2>1.</span><span class=desl2>	(Mishnah):</span> At first, anyone who wanted to be Torem would do it. When more than one wanted, they would race up the ramp. Whoever came first within four Amos of the top would be Torem;</p>
<p class=secondindent><span class=numl2>2.</span>	If there was a tie, the appointee would tell them to stick out one or two fingers (for the sake of a lottery);</p>
<p class=thirdindent><span class=numl3>i.</span>	One does not stick out a thumb in the Mikdash.</p>
<p class=secondindent><span class=numl2>3.</span>	A case occurred in which two Kohanim were even with each other. One pushed the other, and caused him to break his leg;</p>
<p class=thirdindent><span class=numl3>i.</span>	Chachamim saw a danger, and enacted a lottery to determine who will be Torem.</p>
<p class=firstindent><span class=numl1>(e)</span><span class=desl1>	Answer #2 (Rava):</span> The entire Mishnah is after the enactment;</p>
<p class=secondindent><span class=numl2>1.</span>	It means that one who wants to be in the lottery must immerse before the appointee comes.</p>
<p class=firstindent><span class=numl1>(f)</span><span class=desl1>	(Mishnah):</span> The appointee took the key, opened the Pishpesh (a small opening by the gate), and entered the Azarah from Beis ha'Moked;</p>
<p class=firstindent><span class=numl1>(g)</span>	The Kohanim followed him, carrying two lit torches. They split into two groups. One walked along the eastern balcony, and the other along the western balcony.</p>
<p class=firstindent><span class=numl1>(h)</span>	They would check (that all the Klei Shares are there) until they reached the place where Chavitim (the daily Minchah of the Kohen Gadol) are made. They would meet each other and report that all the Kelim are there. The appointee left some (R. Gershom - woke the) Kohanim who would make the Chavitim.</p>
<p class=firstindent><span class=numl1>(i)</span>	The winner of the lottery would do Terumas ha'Deshen. They would warn him not to touch the pan before Kidush (washing his hands and legs) from the Kiyor (laver);</p>
<p class=secondindent><span class=numl2>1.</span>	They would tell him that the pan is to the west of the ramp, in the corner between the ramp and the Mizbe'ach.</p>
<p class=firstindent><span class=numl1>(j)</span>	He would go alone, without a lamp. He could see due to the light from the fire on the Mizbe'ach. The other Kohanim could not see him (because the ramp was in the way) nor hear him.</p>
<p class=bbbline>28b----------------------------------------28b</p>
<p class=secondindent><span class=numl2>1.</span>	They would hear the wooden wheel that Ben Katin made to draw water for Kidush and to return it to the spring (lest it become disqualified through Linah). They would say "it is time for Kidush."</p>
<p class=firstindent><span class=numl1>(k)</span>	The Kohen took the pan and went on top of the Mizbe'ach. He cleared away the coals, and took the thoroughly burnt coals (i.e. ashes) from the middle. He went down the ramp, turned around to face north (i.e. the Mizbe'ach), and walked about ten Amos along the east side of the ramp.</p>
<p class=firstindent><span class=numl1>(l)</span>	He piled the coals on the floor three Tefachim away from the ramp, the same place where innards of Olas ha'Of and ashes of the inner Mizbe'ach and the Menorah are put.</p>
<p class=firstindent><span class=numl1>(m)</span><span class=desl1>	(Gemara):</span> Were there really balconies in the Azarah?!</p>
<p class=secondindent><span class=numl2>1.</span><span class=desl2>	(Beraisa - R. Eliezer ben Yakov):</span> "Lo Sita Lecha Asherah Kol Etz Etzel Mizbach... " forbids making balconies in the Azarah.</p>
<p class=firstindent><span class=numl1>(n)</span><span class=desl1>	Answer (Rav Chisda):</span> They were of Binyan (Me'iri - attached to the wall; Rosh - of stone. The verse forbids only a (wooden) structure (resting on the floor).)</p>
<p class=newsubject><span class=numt>3)</span> THE CHAVITIM</p>
<p class=firstindent><span class=numl1>(a)</span><span class=desl1>	(Mishnah):</span> They would check... (some Kohanim remained to make the Chavitim).</p>
<p class=firstindent><span class=numl1>(b)</span>	Inference: The Chavitim preceded the morning Tamid.</p>
<p class=firstindent><span class=numl1>(c)</span><span class=desl1>	Contradiction (Beraisa):</span> "V'Arach Aleha ha'Olah" teaches that the morning Tamid goes (directly) on the wood. No Korban precedes it.</p>
<p class=secondindent><span class=numl2>1.</span>	Also, Rava learned from "ha'Olah" that the Tamid is the first Olah. No Korban precedes it.</p>
<p class=firstindent><span class=numl1>(d)</span><span class=desl1>	Answer (Rav Yehudah):</span> They boil water to make Chavitim, but Chavitim are not offered until after the Tamid.</p>
<p class=perekline>PEREK RA'UHU ECHAV</p>
<p class=newsubject><span class=numt>4)</span> THE ASHES ON THE <i>MIZBE'ACH</i></p>
<p class=firstindent><span class=numl1>(a)</span><span class=desl1>	(Mishnah):</span> The other Kohanim saw that he came down (the ramp). They ran to be Mekadesh their hands and feet from the Kiyor. They took shovels (to sweep the ashes) and pitchforks to move limbs and Chelev that were not burned to the sides of the Mizbe'ach;</p>
<p class=secondindent><span class=numl2>1.</span>	If there was not room on the sides, they put them on the ramp near the Sovev. (Six Amos above the ground, the Mizbe'ach recesses one Amah. This creates a walkway called the Svev. It is considered as they are still on the Mizbe'ach, so Linah does not apply, therefore later they may be returned to the fire.)</p>
<p class=firstindent><span class=numl1>(b)</span>	They began sweeping the ashes to the Tapu'ach, i.e. a mound in the middle of the Mizbe'ach;</p>
<p class=secondindent><span class=numl2>1.</span>	Sometimes there were 300 Kor in the Tapu'ach. (One Kor is 30 Sa'im, roughly 10 liters. When there were too many ashes, Kohanim would take them outside Yerushalayim.)</p>
<p class=secondindent><span class=numl2>2.</span>	On the festivals they intentionally left the ashes, for it testifies to the grandeur of the Mizbe'ach (the multitude of Korbanos brought). Kohanim were never slothful to remove the ashes.</p>
