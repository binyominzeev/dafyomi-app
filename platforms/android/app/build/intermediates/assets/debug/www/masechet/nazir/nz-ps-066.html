<p class="bas subject"><span class="nm">1)</span>SEMINAL EMISSIONS OF A <i>ZAV</i></p>
<p class="bas indent1"><span class="nm">(a)</span><span class="cl">(Mishnah):</span> If he sees b'Ones, or if there is a Safek...</p>
<p class="bas indent1"><span class="nm">(b)</span><span class="cl">(Rava):</span> The Safek is not whether or not he had an emission;</p>
<p class="bas indent2"><span class="nm">1.</span>Rather, he surely had an emission, but we are unsure if it was pure Zivah (which cancels previous clean days counted), or if there was semen with it (in which case it is not a clean day, but it does not cancel previous clean days).</p>
<p class="bas indent2"><span class="nm">2.</span>Once he became a Zav, a Safek is Tamei (it is assumed to be Zivah).</p>
<p class="bas indent1"><span class="nm">(c)</span><span class="cl">(Mishnah):</span> His semen is Tamei.</p>
<p class="bas indent1"><span class="nm">(d)</span><span class="cl">Question:</span> In what respect is it Tamei?</p>
<p class="bas indent2"><span class="nm">1.</span><span class="cl">Suggestion:</span> It is Metamei one who touches it.</p>
<p class="bas indent2"><span class="nm">2.</span><span class="cl">Rejection:</span> This applies to everyone's semen!</p>
<p class="bas indent1"><span class="nm">(e)</span><span class="cl">Answer #1:</span> Rather, it has Tum'as Masa (it is Metamei one who moves it).</p>
<p class="bas indent2"><span class="nm">1.</span><span class="cl">Question:</span> Which Tana says so?</p>
<p class="bas indent2"><span class="nm">2.</span><span class="cl">Suggestion:</span> It is R. Yehoshua:</p>
<p class="bas indent3"><span class="nm">i.</span><span class="cl">(Beraisa - R. Eliezer):</span> Semen of a Zav does not have Tum'as Masa;</p>
<p class="bas indent3"><span class="nm">ii.</span>R. Yehoshua says that it has, for surely it contains drops of Zivah.</p>
<p class="bas indent2"><span class="nm">3.</span><span class="cl">Rejection:</span> The Mishnah connotes that the semen itself has Tum'as Masa. R. Yehoshua says that only the Zivah inside does!</p>
<p class="bas indent1"><span class="nm">(f)</span><span class="cl">Answer #2 (Rav Ada bar Ahavah):</span> If a Zav sees (has a flow of) Zivah (within 24 hours) after a seminal emission, the Zivah is considered like proper Zivah (we do not attribute it to the semen. This is why the Mishnah calls the semen 'Tamei'.)</p>
<p class="bas indent1"><span class="nm">(g)</span><span class="cl">Version #1 (Tosfos, Rosh) (Rav Papa):</span> Rav Ada holds that if one who was Tahor sees Zivah after semen, we attribute it to weakness due to the semen. (But for a Zav, even Zivah b'Ones is considered Zivah.)</p>
<p class="bas indent1"><span class="nm">(h)</span><span class="cl">Question (Rava - Mishnah):</span> A convert can become a Zav immediately after converting (even if he saw semen right before converting. We discuss one who was circumcised previously. If he was weak from Milah, this would be Ones!)</p>
<p class="bas indent2"><span class="nm">1.</span>We should attribute the Zivah to his weakness (like a Yisrael who saw Zivah after semen! Rosh - a convert is even weaker, due to anxiety about accepting the Mitzvos.)</p>
<p class="bas indent1"><span class="nm">(i)</span><span class="cl">Version #2 (Rashi) (Rav Papa):</span> Rav Ada holds that proper Zivah is due to weakness. A Zav is known to be weak, so we attribute the Zivah to his weakness. (If one who was Tahor sees Zivah after semen, we attribute it to the semen.)</p>
<p class="bas indent1"><span class="nm">(j)</span><span class="cl">Question (Rava - Mishnah):</span> A (previously circumcised) convert can become a Zav immediately after converting (even if he saw semen just before converting).</p>
<p class="bas indent2"><span class="nm">1.</span>We should attribute the Zivah to the semen, since he is not weak!</p>
<p class="bas indent1"><span class="nm">(k)</span><span class="cl">Answer (Rav Papa):</span> There is conversion (accepting the yoke of Mitzvos) is the ultimate weakness! (end of Version #2)</p>
<p class="bas indent1"><span class="nm">(l)</span><span class="cl">Defense (of Answer #1, and Answer to Question (e:1)):</span> The following Tana'im hold that semen of a Zav has Tum'as Masa:</p>
<p class="bas indent2"><span class="nm">1.</span><span class="cl">(Beraisa):</span> If a Zav sees semen within 24 hours of seeing Zivah, the semen has Tum'as Masa;</p>
<p class="bas indent2"><span class="nm">2.</span>R. Yosi says, it is only if the semen comes on the same day as the Zivah.</p>
<p class="bas indent1"><span class="nm">(m)</span><span class="cl">Question:</span> What do they argue about?</p>
<p class="bas indent1"><span class="nm">(n)</span><span class="cl">Answer:</span> They give different answers to Shmuel's question:</p>
<p class="bas indent2"><span class="nm">1.</span><span class="cl">Contradiction (Shmuel):</span> It says "when a man will be Tamei, a nighttime emission" (i.e. if he was a Zav, and he had a seminal emission the night after seeing Zivah, it has Tum'as Masa);</p>
<p class="bas indent2"><span class="nm">2.</span>It also says "he will immerse Lifnos Erev" (this suggests that semen is like Zivah until the day is Poneh (leaves, after 24 hours)!</p>
<p class="bas indent3"><span class="nm">i.</span>R. Yosi learns from the first verse. Chachamim learn from the second.</p>
<p class="bas indent1"><span class="nm">(o)</span><span class="cl">Question:</span> How do Chachamim expound the first verse?</p>
<p class="bas indent1"><span class="nm">(p)</span><span class="cl">Answer:</span> The verse discusses the usual case. Emissions usually come at night.</p>
<p class="bas subject"><span class="nm">2)</span>WAS SHMUEL A <i>NAZIR</i>?</p>
<p class="bas indent1"><span class="nm">(a)</span><span class="cl">(Mishnah - R. Nehorai):</span> Shmuel was a Nazir.</p>
<p class="bas indent2"><span class="nm">1.</span>It says about Shmuel "Morah (a Ta'ar) will not pass over his head". "Morah" is also said regarding Shimshon.</p>
<p class="bas indent2"><span class="nm">2.</span>Just like Shimshon was a Nazir, also Shmuel.</p>
<p class="bas indent1"><span class="nm">(b)</span><span class="cl">R. Yosi:</span> "Morah" refers to "Mora" (fear), that Shmuel will not fear people.</p>
<p class="bas indent1"><span class="nm">(c)</span><span class="cl">Objection (R. Nehorai):</span> "Shmuel said 'how can I go? Sha'ul will hear and kill me'". This shows that he feared people!</p>

<p class="bas subject"><span class="nm">3)</span>IS IT BETTER TO BLESS OR TO ANSWER <i>AMEN</i>?</p>
<p class="bas indent1"><span class="nm">(a)</span>Rav and Rav Huna instructed their sons to say Birkas ha'Mazon to exempt the others.</p>
<p class="bas indent1"><span class="nm">(b)</span><span class="cl">Inference:</span> They hold that it is better to bless than to answer Amen.</p>
<p class="bas indent1"><span class="nm">(c)</span><span class="cl">Question (Beraisa - R. Yosi):</span> The one who answers Amen is greater than the one who blesses;</p>
<p class="bas indent2"><span class="nm">1.</span><span class="cl">R. Nehorai:</span> We find so regarding war. The weak ones fight first, and the victory is credited to the strong ones that finish.</p>
<p class="bas indent1"><span class="nm">(d)</span><span class="cl">Answer:</span> Rav and Rav Huna hold like the following Tana.</p>
<p class="bas indent2"><span class="nm">1.</span><span class="cl">(Beraisa):</span> Both the one who blesses and the one who answers Amen get reward. Reward is paid first to the one who blesses.</p>
<p class="bas indent1"><span class="nm">(e)</span><span class="cl">(R. Elazar):</span> Chachamim increase Shalom in the world - "All your children will know (will be Talmidim of) Hash-m; great will be the Shalom of your children."</p>
