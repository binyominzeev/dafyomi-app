<p class="bas subject"><span class="nm">1)</span>FALSE AND VAIN OATHS (cont.)</p>
<p class="bas indent1"><span class="nm">(a)</span><span class="cl">Answer #2:</span> Just like one brings a Korban for Sheker, also for Shav;</p>
<p class="bas indent2"><span class="nm">1.</span>The Beraisa is R. Akiva, who obligates a Korban for oaths of the past like for the future.</p>
<p class="bas indent1"><span class="nm">(b)</span><span class="cl">Question (Beraisa):</span> A Shav oath is one that everyone knows to be false. Sheker is swearing to change (from the truth, i.e. something of the past).</p>
<p class="bas indent1"><span class="nm">(c)</span><span class="cl">Answer:</span> The Beraisa means, Sheker is swearing <i>and changing</i> (from what he swore to do, i.e. in the future).</p>
<p class="bas indent1"><span class="nm">(d)</span><span class="cl">(Ravin citing R. Avahu citing R. Yochanan):</span> If one falsely swore 'I ate' or 'I did not eat', this is Sheker. V'Lo Sishav'u bi'Shmi la'Shaker" forbids it;</p>
<p class="bas indent2"><span class="nm">1.</span>If he swore 'I will eat' or 'I will not eat', he is commanded "Lo Yachel Devaro."</p>
<p class="bas indent2"><span class="nm">2.</span>A Shav oath is one that everyone knows to be false.</p>
<p class="bas subject"><span class="nm">2)</span>FOR WHICH OATHS IS ONE GIVEN MALKUS?</p>
<p class="bas indent1"><span class="nm">(a)</span><span class="cl">(Rav Papa):</span> R. Yochanan did not explicitly say the above teaching. Rather, R. Avahu inferred it from the following.</p>
<p class="bas indent2"><span class="nm">1.</span><span class="cl">(Rav Idi bar Avin citing R. Yochanan):</span> One is lashed for a Lav that is done through an action;</p>
<p class="bas indent2"><span class="nm">2.</span>The only Lavim without an action for which one is lashed are swearing (falsely), Temurah and cursing a Yisrael with Hash-m's name.</p>
<p class="bas indent1"><span class="nm">(b)</span><span class="cl">Question:</span> What is the source of lashes for swearing?</p>
<p class="bas indent1"><span class="nm">(c)</span><span class="cl">Answer (R. Yochanan):</span> "Lo Sisa... la'Shav Ki Lo Yenakeh" - the Heavenly court does not cleanse, but Beis Din lashes and cleanses.</p>
<p class="bas indent1"><span class="nm">(d)</span><span class="cl">Question (Rav Papa):</span> Perhaps it is not cleansed at all!</p>
<p class="bas indent1"><span class="nm">(e)</span><span class="cl">Answer (Abaye):</span> Had it said only "Lo Yenakeh", that would be correct;</p>
<p class="bas indent2"><span class="nm">1.</span>Rather, it says "Lo Yenakeh Hash-m", but Beis Din cleanses.</p>
<p class="bas indent1"><span class="nm">(f)</span><span class="cl">Question:</span> This teaches about lashes only for a Shav oath. What is the source for Sheker?</p>
<p class="bas indent1"><span class="nm">(g)</span><span class="cl">Answer (R. Yochanan):</span> It says twice "la'Shav";</p>
<p class="bas indent2"><span class="nm">1.</span>We use the extra one to teach about Sheker.</p>
<p class="bas indent1"><span class="nm">(h)</span><span class="cl">Question (R. Avahu):</span> What kind of Sheker do we learn to?</p>
<p class="bas indent2"><span class="nm">1.</span><span class="cl">Suggestion:</span> If he swore 'I will not eat' and he ate, he transgressed through an action! (We already know that he is lashed.)</p>
<p class="bas indent1"><span class="nm">(i)</span><span class="cl">Answer #1:</span> Rather, he swore 'I will eat', and he did not eat.</p>
<p class="bas indent1"><span class="nm">(j)</span><span class="cl">Objection:</span> He is not lashed for this!</p>
<p class="bas indent2"><span class="nm">1.</span><span class="cl">(R. Yochanan and Reish Lakish):</span> If one swore 'I will eat this loaf today' and he did not, he is not lashed.</p>
<p class="bas indent3"><span class="nm">i.</span><span class="cl">(R. Yochanan):</span> He is not lashed because he transgressed without an action. One is not lashed for such a Lav;</p>
<p class="bas indent3"><span class="nm">ii.</span><span class="cl">(Reish Lakish):</span> He is not lashed because he did not receive definite warning (right before transgressing, at the end of the day. No one knows precisely when the day ends.)</p>
<p class="bas indent1"><span class="nm">(k)</span><span class="cl">Answer #2 (R. Avahu):</span> Rather, he swore 'I ate' or 'I did not eat.'</p>
<p class="bas indent1"><span class="nm">(l)</span><span class="cl">Question:</span> Here also, he transgressed without an action. Why is he lashed?</p>
<p class="bas indent1"><span class="nm">(m)</span><span class="cl">Answer (Rava):</span> The Torah teaches that one is lashed for Sheker that resembles Shav, i.e. in the past.</p>
<p class="bas indent1"><span class="nm">(n)</span><span class="cl">Question (against R. Avahu - R. Yirmeyah - Mishnah):</span> If Reuven said 'I swear that I will not eat this loaf, I swear that I will not eat it, I swear that I will not eat it' and ate it, he is liable only for one oath;</p>
<p class="bas indent2"><span class="nm">1.</span><i>This</i> is the Shevu'ah of Bituy for which one is lashed if he was Mezid, and brings an Oleh v'Yored if he was Shogeg.</p>
<p class="bas indent2"><span class="nm">2.</span><span class="cl">Suggestion:</span> 'This' excludes 'I ate' or 'I did not eat.' He is not lashed for them!</p>
<p class="bas indent1"><span class="nm">(o)</span><span class="cl">Answer #1:</span> No, it excludes 'I ate' or 'I did not eat', to teach that he does not bring a Korban for them;</p>
<p class="bas indent2"><span class="nm">1.</span>The Mishnah is R. Yishmael, who says that a Korban is brought only for oaths about the future;</p>
<p class="bas indent2"><span class="nm">2.</span>He is lashed for 'I ate' or 'I did not eat.'</p>
<p class="bas bbbline">21b----------------------------------------21b</p>
<p class="bas indent2"><span class="nm">3.</span><span class="cl">Question (Seifa):</span> <i>This</i> is the Shevu'as Shav for which there are lashes, but not a Korban;</p>
<p class="bas indent3"><span class="nm">i.</span><span class="cl">Suggestion:</span> This excludes 'I ate' or 'I did not eat.' He is not lashed for them!</p>
<p class="bas indent2"><span class="nm">4.</span><span class="cl">Answer:</span> No, it excludes 'I ate' or 'I did not eat', to teach that he brings a Korban for them;</p>
<p class="bas indent3"><span class="nm">i.</span>This is like R. Akiva, who obligates a Korban for the past like for the future.</p>
<p class="bas indent2"><span class="nm">5.</span><span class="cl">Objection:</span> Is the Reisha R. Yishmael, and the Seifa is R. Akiva?!</p>
<p class="bas indent1"><span class="nm">(p)</span><span class="cl">Answer #2:</span> The entire Mishnah is R. Akiva;</p>
<p class="bas indent2"><span class="nm">1.</span>The Reisha does not exclude 'I ate' or 'I did not eat' from a Korban. Rather, it excludes 'I will eat' from lashes (if he does not eat, since he transgresses through inaction), but he brings a Korban (if he was Shogeg).</p>
<p class="bas indent1"><span class="nm">(q)</span><span class="cl">Version #1 (Rashi) Question:</span> Why didn't he say that the Reisha excludes also 'I ate' and 'I did not eat' from lashes?</p>
<p class="bas indent1"><span class="nm">(r)</span><span class="cl">Version #2 (Tosfos) Question:</span> Why didn't he answer that the entire Mishnah is R. Yishmael? The Reisha excludes 'I ate' and 'I did not eat' from lashes, and the Seifa excludes them from a Korban. (end of Version #2)</p>
<p class="bas indent1"><span class="nm">(s)</span><span class="cl">Answer:</span> The Reisha teaches about an oath of the future. Presumably, it excludes an oath of the future.</p>
<p class="bas subject"><span class="nm">3)</span>LIABILITY FOR EATING A SMALL AMOUNT</p>
<p class="bas indent1"><span class="nm">(a)</span><span class="cl">(Mishnah - R. Akiva):</span> If one swore 'I will not eat' and he ate Mashehu, he is liable...</p>
<p class="bas indent1"><span class="nm">(b)</span><span class="cl">Question:</span> How does R. Akiva hold in general?</p>
<p class="bas indent2"><span class="nm">1.</span><span class="cl">Possibility #1:</span> He holds like R. Shimon, that one is lashed for eating Mashehu of any prohibition;</p>
<p class="bas indent3"><span class="nm">i.</span><span class="cl">(Beraisa - R. Shimon):</span> One is lashed for eating Mashehu of any prohibition. A k'Zayis (the volume of an olive) pertains only to bringing a Korban.</p>
<p class="bas indent3"><span class="nm">ii.</span>Really, the argument of R. Akiva and Chachamim could have been taught elsewhere. It was taught about Shevu'os to teach that Chachamim do <i>not</i> say that just like he is liable for Mashehu if he specifies (in the oath that he will not eat Mashehu), he is liable for Mashehu (even without specifying),</p>
<p class="bas indent2"><span class="nm">2.</span><span class="cl">Possibility #2:</span> Normally, R. Akiva holds like Chachamim;</p>
<p class="bas indent3"><span class="nm">i.</span>Only regarding Shevu'os he obligates for Mashehu, just like he is liable for Mashehu if he specifies.</p>
<p class="bas indent1"><span class="nm">(c)</span><span class="cl">Answer #1 (Mishnah - Chachamim):</span> We never find that someone is liable for eating Mashehu!</p>
<p class="bas indent2"><span class="nm">1.</span>If R. Akiva normally holds like R. Shimon, he should answer 'I hold that one is always liable for eating Mashehu'!</p>
<p class="bas indent1"><span class="nm">(d)</span><span class="cl">Rejection:</span> R. Akiva answered Chachamim according to their opinion;</p>
<p class="bas indent2"><span class="nm">1.</span>I normally hold like R. Shimon. You should admit to me about Shevu'os, for just like he is liable for Mashehu if he specifies, he is liable for Mashehu even without specifying.</p>
<p class="bas indent2"><span class="nm">2.</span>Chachamim did not agree.</p>
<p class="bas indent1"><span class="nm">(e)</span><span class="cl">Answer #2 (Mishnah - R. Akiva):</span> If a Nazir ate bread that was soaked in wine and there is a k'Zayis of wine and bread together, he is liable.</p>
<p class="bas indent2"><span class="nm">1.</span>If he normally held like R. Shimon, a Nazir would be liable for Mashehu of wine, so there would be no need to join to a k'Zayis! (This proof is accepted. We bring another proof, anyway.)</p>
<p class="bas indent1"><span class="nm">(f)</span><span class="cl">Answer #3 (Mishnah):</span> If one swore 'I will not eat', and he ate Neveilos, Treifos, rodents or insects, he is liable (for the oath);</p>
<p class="bas indent2"><span class="nm">1.</span>R. Shimon exempts.</p>
<p class="bas indent2"><span class="nm">2.</span><span class="cl">Question:</span> Why do Chachamim obligate him? The oath (that Yisrael accepted on Sinai) already obligates him not to eat them (so his oath does not takes effect)!</p>
<p class="bas indent2"><span class="nm">3.</span><span class="cl">Answer #1 (Rav, Shmuel and R. Yochanan):</span> Since his oath takes effect on permitted food, it takes effect also on forbidden food.</p>
<p class="bas indent2"><span class="nm">4.</span><span class="cl">Answer #2 (Reish Lakish):</span> The Torah forbids him only from eating a k'Zayis of these things. His oath forbids him from eating Mashehu;</p>
<p class="bas indent3"><span class="nm">i.</span>We find this according to Chachamim if he specified (Mashehu), or according to R. Akiva even without specifying.</p>
<p class="bas indent2"><span class="nm">5.</span><span class="cl">Culmination of answer:</span> If R. Akiva held like R. Shimon, the Torah forbids him from eating Mashehu!</p>
<p class="bas indent2"><span class="nm">6.</span>We conclude (from Reish Lakish) that normally, R. Akiva does not hold like R. Shimon.</p>
<p class="bas indent1"><span class="nm">(g)</span><span class="cl">(Mishnah - Chachamim):</span> We never find that someone is liable for eating Mashehu!</p>
<p class="bas indent1"><span class="nm">(h)</span><span class="cl">Question:</span> One is liable for eating an ant of any size!</p>
<p class="bas indent1"><span class="nm">(i)</span><span class="cl">Answer:</span> That is because it is a full creation.</p>
<p class="bas indent1"><span class="nm">(j)</span><span class="cl">Question:</span> One is liable for eating Hekdesh, even less than a k'Zayis!</p>
<p class="bas indent1"><span class="nm">(k)</span><span class="cl">Answer:</span> There is a minimum quantity (albeit of value) for liability, i.e. a Perutah.</p>
<p class="bas indent1"><span class="nm">(l)</span><span class="cl">Question:</span> If one specified in his oath, he is liable for Mashehu!</p>
<p class="bas indent1"><span class="nm">(m)</span><span class="cl">Answer:</span> There, he showed that Mashehu is important to him, so he is liable for it, just like for a creation.</p>
<p class="bas indent1"><span class="nm">(n)</span><span class="cl">Question:</span> Why don't we say that he is liable for Mashehu of dirt (i.e. a k'Zayis is the quantity only for things normally eaten)?</p>
<p class="bas indent2"><span class="nm">1.</span><span class="cl">Suggestion:</span> Since Chachamim say that he is never liable for Mashehu, they must hold that one is liable for dirt only for a k'Zayis. This settles Rava's question!</p>
<p class="bas indent3"><span class="nm">i.</span><span class="cl">Question (Rava):</span> If one said 'I swear that I will not eat', and he ate dirt, how much must he eat to be liable?</p>
<p class="bas indent1"><span class="nm">(o)</span><span class="cl">Answer (and rejection of suggestion):</span> Chachamim meant that we never find that one is liable for eating Mashehu of something that is normally eaten.</p>
<p class="bas indent1"><span class="nm">(p)</span><span class="cl">Question:</span> One is liable for eating Mashehu of Konamos (something forbidden through a Neder)!</p>
<p class="bas indent1"><span class="nm">(q)</span><span class="cl">Answer:</span> Also Konamos is like specifying (Mashehu, since he does not mention eating).</p>
