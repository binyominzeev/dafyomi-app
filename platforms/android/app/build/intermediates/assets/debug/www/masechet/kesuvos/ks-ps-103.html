<p class="bas subject"><span class="nm">1)</span>ONE WHO DOES NOT NEED LIKE HE STIPULATED</p>
<p class="bas indent1"><span class="nm">(a)</span><span class="cl">(Mishnah):</span> Both husbands cannot say...</p>
<p class="bas indent1"><span class="nm">(b)</span>A case occurred in which Reuven rented a mill to Shimon. They agreed that in lieu of paying, Shimon would grind Reuven's grain. Reuven waxed rich, and bought a mill and a donkey to grind.</p>
<p class="bas indent2"><span class="nm">1.</span><span class="cl">Reuven:</span> Until now, you were grinding for me. Now (I do not need this, so) pay me money.</p>
<p class="bas indent2"><span class="nm">2.</span><span class="cl">Shimon:</span> No, I will continue to grind for you.</p>
<p class="bas indent1"><span class="nm">(c)</span><span class="cl">(Ravina):</span> This is like our Mishnah. The husbands cannot say 'we will feed her together.' Rather, one feeds her, and the other gives to her the monetary equivalent.</p>
<p class="bas indent1"><span class="nm">(d)</span><span class="cl">Rejection (Rav Avira):</span> The cases are different! A girl has no use for two portions of food. Shimon can tell Reuven, use your grinder to grind and sell to others, and I will grind for you!</p>
<p class="bas indent2"><span class="nm">1.</span>This is only if Shimon cannot find people who will pay him to grind for them. If he could find such people, we do not allow Midas Sedom. (He can help Reuven without losing himself by grinding for others instead of for Reuven, so we force him to do so.)</p>
<p class="bas subject"><span class="nm">2)</span>THE WIDOW REMAINS WHERE SHE WAS LIVING</p>
<p class="bas indent1"><span class="nm">(a)</span><span class="cl">(Mishnah):</span> If a widow does not want to leave the house of her deceased husband, the orphans cannot say 'Return to your father's house; and we will feed you there.' Rather, they feed her, and give to her living quarters according to her honor;</p>
<p class="bas indent1"><span class="nm">(b)</span>If she says 'I want to stay in my father's house' the orphans can say 'we will feed you only if you are by us';</p>
<p class="bas indent2"><span class="nm">1.</span>If she claims that she must stay in her father's house (to avoid suspicion) because both she and they are young, they feed her in her father's house.</p>
<p class="bas indent1"><span class="nm">(c)</span><span class="cl">(Gemara - Beraisa):</span> She lives in the house like in her husband's lifetime. The same applies to using slaves, pillows and blankets, and gold and silver Kelim.</p>
<p class="bas indent2"><span class="nm">1.</span>Her husband wrote in the Kesuvah 'You will live in my house and be fed from my property your entire widowhood.'</p>
<p class="bas indent1"><span class="nm">(d)</span><span class="cl">(Rav Yosef - Beraisa):</span> He wrote 'in my house' - not in my hut. (If his dwelling was small, he did not write that she will expel his children to live there.</p>
<p class="bas indent1"><span class="nm">(e)</span><span class="cl">(Rav Nachman):</span> If orphans sold a widow's quarters, the sale is invalid.</p>
<p class="bas indent1"><span class="nm">(f)</span><span class="cl">Question:</span> Why is this different than R. Asi's law?</p>
<p class="bas indent2"><span class="nm">1.</span><span class="cl">(R. Asi):</span> If orphans sold property of a small estate (i.e. the estate will not suffice to feed the children until the daughters grow up), the sale is valid.</p>
<p class="bas indent1"><span class="nm">(g)</span><span class="cl">Answer:</span> There, there was no lien on the property in the father's lifetime. Here, there was.</p>
<p class="bas indent1"><span class="nm">(h)</span><span class="cl">(Abaye):</span> The Halachah is, if a widow's quarters fell, the heirs need not rebuild it.</p>
<p class="bas indent2"><span class="nm">1.</span><span class="cl">Support (Beraisa):</span> If a widow's quarters fell, the heirs need not rebuild it. Further, if she wants to rebuild it herself, they can stop her.</p>
<p class="bas indent1"><span class="nm">(i)</span><span class="cl">Question (Abaye):</span> If she strengthened it before it fell, what is the law? (Rashi; Tosfos - may she strengthen it before it falls?)</p>
<p class="bas indent2"><span class="nm">1.</span>This question is unresolved.</p>
<p class="bas indent1"><span class="nm">(j)</span><span class="cl">(Mishnah):</span> If she said (... they need not feed her unless she is with them).</p>
<p class="bas indent1"><span class="nm">(k)</span><span class="cl">Question:</span> The orphans should feed her there!</p>
<p class="bas indent1"><span class="nm">(l)</span><span class="cl">Answer:</span> The Mishnah supports Rav Huna:</p>
<p class="bas indent2"><span class="nm">1.</span><span class="cl">(Rav Huna):</span> (More) Berachah rests on a bigger household.</p>
<p class="bas indent1"><span class="nm">(m)</span><span class="cl">Question:</span> They should feed her and deduct the loss due to the smaller household!</p>
<p class="bas indent1"><span class="nm">(n)</span><span class="cl">Answer:</span> Indeed, they do.</p>
<p class="bas indent1"><span class="nm">(o)</span><span class="cl">(Rav Huna):</span> Chachamim teach how to obtain Berachah (like we taught), wealth, and cures;</p>
<p class="bas indent2"><span class="nm">1.</span><span class="cl">Wealth - (Mishnah):</span> If Reuven is buying produce and he took it to his Reshus but did not measure it, he acquired it. If he measured it but did not pull it, he did not acquire it.</p>
<p class="bas indent3"><span class="nm">i.</span>If he is clever, he rents the place where the produce is (and acquires it right away).</p>
<p class="bas indent2"><span class="nm">2.</span><span class="cl">Cures - (Mishnah):</span> A person may not chew wheat on Pesach and put it on a wound, because the wheat will become Chametz.</p>
<p class="bas subject"><span class="nm">3)</span>REBBI'S PASSING</p>
<p class="bas indent1"><span class="nm">(a)</span><span class="cl">(Beraisa):</span> When Rebbi passed away, he instructed his sons: be careful to honor your mother, and leave a light burning in my place, and the table and bed set. Yosef of Chaifa and Shimon of Efrat served me in my lifetime; they will serve me in my death.</p>
<p class="bas indent2"><span class="nm">1.</span><span class="cl">Question:</span> Why did he need to tell them to honor their mother? This is mid'Oraisa!</p>
<p class="bas indent2"><span class="nm">2.</span><span class="cl">Answer:</span> He referred to his wife (she was not their mother).</p>
<p class="bas indent2"><span class="nm">3.</span><span class="cl">Question:</span> This is also mid'Oraisa!</p>
<p class="bas indent3"><span class="nm">i.</span><span class="cl">(Beraisa):</span> "Kaved <i>Es</i> Avicha <i>v'Es</i> Imecha l'Ma'an Ya'arichu Yamecha" - the first "Es" includes your father's wife. The second includes your mother's husband. The 'Vav' (in <i>v</i>'Es) includes your older brother.</p>
<p class="bas indent2"><span class="nm">4.</span><span class="cl">Answer:</span> The Torah commands to honor a parent's spouse in the parent's lifetime.</p>
<p class="bas indent1"><span class="nm">(b)</span><span class="cl">(Beraisa):</span> Leave a light burning in my place, and the table and bed set.</p>
<p class="bas indent1"><span class="nm">(c)</span><span class="cl">Question:</span> Why did Rebbi request this?</p>
<p class="bas indent1"><span class="nm">(d)</span><span class="cl">Answer:</span> Every week, when Shabbos entered, Rebbi returned to his house.</p>
<p class="bas indent2"><span class="nm">1.</span>Once, a neighbor called on the porch and Rebbi's slave asked her to be quiet, lest she disturb Rebbi.</p>
<p class="bas indent2"><span class="nm">2.</span>Rebbi stopped coming, lest (it become known that he was returning and) people look down on previous Tzadikim who did not return.</p>
<p class="bas indent1"><span class="nm">(e)</span><span class="cl">(Beraisa):</span> Yosef of Chaifa and Shimon of Efrat served me in my lifetime; they will serve me in my death.</p>
<p class="bas indent1"><span class="nm">(f)</span>People thought that Rebbi meant that they would serve him in this world (in his burial). When they saw that Yosef and Shimon died before Rebbi, they realized that he meant that they will serve him in the world to come.</p>
<p class="bas indent2"><span class="nm">1.</span>He knew that they would die before him. He feared lest people suspect that Yosef and Shimon did not have merits of their own and lived only in Rebbi's merit (and therefore they did not merit to engage in his burial).</p>
<p class="bas indent2"><span class="nm">2.</span>To disprove this, he made it known that they would serve him in the next world.</p>
<p class="bas indent1"><span class="nm">(g)</span>Rebbi charged Chachamim 'Do not eulogize me in medium cities. Thirty days after my death, people should learn. My son Shimon is the Chacham, my son Gamliel will be the Nasi, and Chanina bar Chama will head the academy.</p>
<p class="bas bbbline">103b----------------------------------------103b</p>
<p class="bas indent2"><span class="nm">1.</span>People thought that Rebbi did not want to exert them to eulogize him in medium cities (rather, in villages).</p>
<p class="bas indent2"><span class="nm">2.</span>When they saw that he was eulogized in the great cities and everyone came, they realized that he intended to make it more honorable.</p>
<p class="bas indent1"><span class="nm">(h)</span>'Thirty days after my death, people should learn.' He reasoned that people should not mourn over him longer than over Moshe Rabeinu - "Bnei Yisrael cried over Moshe... for 30 days".</p>
<p class="bas indent2"><span class="nm">1.</span>For 30 days, they eulogized Rebbi day and night. After that, he would be eulogized by day and they learned at night, or vice-versa.</p>
<p class="bas indent2"><span class="nm">2.</span>This continued for 12 months.</p>
<p class="bas indent1"><span class="nm">(i)</span>The day Rebbi passed away, a voice from Shamayim proclaimed that all who were at the passing of Rebbi are prepared for the world to come.(without any punishment).</p>
<p class="bas indent2"><span class="nm">1.</span>There was a launderer who used to come in front of Rebbi every day. The day Rebbi expired, he did not come. When he heard, he jumped off the roof out of anguish.</p>
<p class="bas indent2"><span class="nm">2.</span>A voice from Shamayim declared that also the launderer is prepared for the world to come.</p>
<p class="bas indent1"><span class="nm">(j)</span><span class="cl">Question:</span> What did Rebbi mean when he said 'My son Shimon is the Chacham'?</p>
<p class="bas indent1"><span class="nm">(k)</span><span class="cl">Answer:</span> Even though Shimon is the bigger Chacham, Gamliel will be the Nasi.</p>
<p class="bas indent1"><span class="nm">(l)</span><span class="cl">Question (Levi):</span> Did Rebbi really need to say this?</p>
<p class="bas indent1"><span class="nm">(m)</span><span class="cl">Answer (Shimon):</span> Yes!</p>
<p class="bas indent1"><span class="nm">(n)</span><span class="cl">Question:</span> Why? "He gave the kingship to Yehoram, since he was the firstborn".</p>
<p class="bas indent1"><span class="nm">(o)</span><span class="cl">Answer:</span> Yehoram replaced his father (he was as qualified as any of his brothers), but Gamliel did not.</p>
<p class="bas indent1"><span class="nm">(p)</span><span class="cl">Question:</span> If so, why did Rebbi make him Nasi?</p>
<p class="bas indent1"><span class="nm">(q)</span><span class="cl">Answer:</span> Gamliel did not replace his father regarding Chochmah, but regarding fear of sin, he did.</p>
<p class="bas subject"><span class="nm">4)</span>THE LEADERS AFTER REBBI</p>
<p class="bas indent1"><span class="nm">(a)</span>Rebbi said 'Chanina bar Chama will head the academy', but Chanina refused, because R. Efes was two and a half years older.</p>
<p class="bas indent1"><span class="nm">(b)</span>R. Efes led the academy, and R. Chanina sat outside (he did not want to be inside and need to be submissive to R. Efes). Levi learned with R. Chanina outside.</p>
<p class="bas indent1"><span class="nm">(c)</span>R. Efes died. R. Chanina then led the academy, and Levi had no one to learn with (Levi did not want to be inside and need to be submissive to R. Chanina), so he went to Bavel.</p>
<p class="bas indent1"><span class="nm">(d)</span>They told Rav 'a great Chacham arrived in Nehardai. He limps, and he permits wearing a Kalah's crown outside on Shabbos. (Only distinguished women wear it, so we are not concerned lest she take it off to show others.) '</p>
<p class="bas indent2"><span class="nm">1.</span><span class="cl">Rav:</span> It must be that R. Efes died, R. Chanina led the academy, and Levi had no one to learn with, so he came to Bavel.</p>
<p class="bas indent2"><span class="nm">2.</span><span class="cl">Question:</span> How did Rav know this? Perhaps R. Chanina died, and Levi had no one to learn with, so he came to Bavel!</p>
<p class="bas indent2"><span class="nm">3.</span><span class="cl">Answer #1:</span> Levi would sooner have been submissive to learn in the academy under R. Efes rather than come to Bavel.</p>
<p class="bas indent2"><span class="nm">4.</span><span class="cl">Answer #2:</span> Since Rebbi said that R. Chanina would head the academy, it had to happen - "(A Tzadik) decrees and it will be fulfilled."</p>
<p class="bas indent1"><span class="nm">(e)</span><span class="cl">Question:</span> R. Chiya was around. Why didn't Rebbi appoint him to lead the academy?</p>
<p class="bas indent1"><span class="nm">(f)</span><span class="cl">Answer #1:</span> R. Chiya had already died.</p>
<p class="bas indent1"><span class="nm">(g)</span><span class="cl">Objection:</span> But R. Chiya said 'I saw Rebbi's coffin and cried over it'!</p>
<p class="bas indent1"><span class="nm">(h)</span><span class="cl">Answer:</span> We must switch that (Rebbi cried over R. Chiya's coffin).</p>
<p class="bas indent1"><span class="nm">(i)</span><span class="cl">Objection:</span> R. Chiya said 'The day Rebbi died, Kedushah ended!'</p>
<p class="bas indent1"><span class="nm">(j)</span><span class="cl">Answer:</span> We must switch that.</p>
<p class="bas indent1"><span class="nm">(k)</span><span class="cl">Objection (Beraisa):</span> When Rebbi got sick, R. Chiya came to visit him and found him crying.</p>
<p class="bas indent2"><span class="nm">1.</span><span class="cl">R. Chiya:</span> Why are you crying?!</p>
<p class="bas indent3"><span class="nm">i.</span><span class="cl">(Beraisa):</span> If one dies amidst laughter, it is a good sign. If he dies amidst crying, it is a bad sign.</p>
<p class="bas indent3"><span class="nm">ii.</span>If his face is up, it is a good sign. If his face is down, it is a bad sign.</p>
<p class="bas indent3"><span class="nm">iii.</span>If he is facing the people, it is a good sign. If he is facing the wall, it is a bad sign.</p>
<p class="bas indent3"><span class="nm">iv.</span>If his face is green, it is a bad sign. If his face is radiant and red, it is a good sign.</p>
<p class="bas indent3"><span class="nm">v.</span>If he dies on Erev Shabbos, it is a good sign; after Shabbos is a bad sign;</p>
<p class="bas indent3"><span class="nm">vi.</span>If he dies on Erev Yom Kipur, it is a bad sign; after Yom Kipur is a good sign;</p>
<p class="bas indent3"><span class="nm">vii.</span>If he dies from stomach sicknesses, it is a good sign, since most Tzadikim die from stomach sicknesses.</p>
<p class="bas indent2"><span class="nm">2.</span><span class="cl">Rebbi:</span> I am crying because of the Torah and Mitzvos I will no longer have.</p>
<p class="bas indent1"><span class="nm">(l)</span><span class="cl">Answer:</span> The Beraisa must be switched.</p>
<p class="bas indent1"><span class="nm">(m)</span><span class="cl">Answer #2 (to Question (e)):</span> We need not switch anything. Rebbi did not appoint R. Chiya to lead the academy, lest it distract him from Mitzvos.</p>
<p class="bas indent2"><span class="nm">1.</span>R. Chanina claimed precedence over R. Chiya, because he was learned enough to return Torah to Yisrael if it would be forgotten;</p>
<p class="bas indent2"><span class="nm">2.</span>R. Chiya claimed precedence over R. Chanina, because he ensured that Torah would not be forgotten!</p>
<p class="bas indent3"><span class="nm">i.</span>R. Chiya planted flax, set traps, caught deer, fed the meat to orphans, made parchments from the skin, and he went to a city without teachers for children. He wrote each Sefer of the Torah on a parchment. He took five children, and taught to each one Sefer. He took six children, and taught one Seder of the Mishnah to each.</p>
<p class="bas indent3"><span class="nm">ii.</span>He told each child to teach what he knew to the others.</p>
<p class="bas indent2"><span class="nm">3.</span><span class="cl">Rebbi:</span> How great are the deeds of R. Chiya!</p>
<p class="bas indent2"><span class="nm">4.</span><span class="cl">Shimon (Rebbi's son):</span> Are they greater even than your deeds?</p>
<p class="bas indent2"><span class="nm">5.</span><span class="cl">Rebbi:</span> Yes.</p>
<p class="bas indent2"><span class="nm">6.</span><span class="cl">R. Yishmael b'Rebbi Yosi:</span> Are they greater than my father's deeds?</p>
<p class="bas indent2"><span class="nm">7.</span><span class="cl">Rebbi:</span> That will never happen.</p>
<p class="bas indent1"><span class="nm">(n)</span>Before he died, Rebbi taught to Shimon how Chachamim should act.</p>
<p class="bas indent1"><span class="nm">(o)</span>Before he died, Rebbi taught Gamliel how the Nasi should act:</p>
<p class="bas indent2"><span class="nm">1.</span>Sit among the great Chachamim, and instill fear in the Talmidim.</p>
<p class="bas indent2"><span class="nm">2.</span><span class="cl">Objection:</span> We learned that "He will honor those who fear Hash-m" refers to Yehoshafat, who would rise from his throne to hug and kiss Chachamim, and would greet them 'Rebbi, Rebbi, my teacher, my teacher'!</p>
<p class="bas indent2"><span class="nm">3.</span><span class="cl">Answer:</span> That was in private. In public, one instills fear in them.</p>
<p class="bas indent1"><span class="nm">(p)</span><span class="cl">(Beraisa):</span> Rebbi was in Tzipori, and his grave was prepared in Beis She'arim.</p>
<p class="bas indent1"><span class="nm">(q)</span><span class="cl">Question (Beraisa):</span> "Pursue justice" - go to (an expert judge, like) Rebbi in Beis She'arim.</p>
<p class="bas indent1"><span class="nm">(r)</span><span class="cl">Answer:</span> Rebbi was in Beis She'arim. When he got sick, they took him to Tzipori, since it is elevated and has good air.</p>
