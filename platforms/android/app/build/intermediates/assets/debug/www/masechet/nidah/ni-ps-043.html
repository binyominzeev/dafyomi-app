<p class="bas subject"><span class="nm">1)</span><i>TUM'AH</i> OF A <i>ZAV</i> MUST BE EXPOSED</p>
<p class="bas indent1"><span class="nm">(a)</span><span class="cl">(Rava):</span> If a man's skin folded over and a Sheretz was inside, he is Tahor, for a Sheretz has only Tum'as Maga. It is not Metamei in Beis ha'Starim;</p>
<p class="bas indent1"><span class="nm">(b)</span>If a Nevelah was inside, he is Tamei, for it has (also) Tum'as Masa, which is Metamei in Beis ha'Starim.</p>
<p class="bas indent1"><span class="nm">(c)</span>If a Sheretz was in his fold, and it was in the airspace of an (earthenware) oven, the oven is Tamei.</p>
<p class="bas indent1"><span class="nm">(d)</span><span class="cl">Objection:</span> This is obvious! (Klei Cheres become Tamei from their airspace, whether or not they touch the Tum'ah.)</p>
<p class="bas indent1"><span class="nm">(e)</span><span class="cl">Answer:</span> A Kli Cheres is Mekabel Tum'ah from "Tocho" (its inside), but not from Toch Tocho (Tum'ah inside a Kli inside the a Kli Cheres);</p>
<p class="bas indent2"><span class="nm">1.</span>One might have thought that similarly, Tum'ah inside a fold inside the oven is not Metamei it. Rava teaches that this is not so.</p>
<p class="bas indent1"><span class="nm">(f)</span><span class="cl">(Reish Lakish):</span> If (one end of) a reed is in the fold of a Zav and he uses it to move a Tahor (person), the Tahor person remains Tahor;</p>
<p class="bas indent2"><span class="nm">1.</span>If a reed is in the fold of a Tahor and he uses it to move a Zav, the Tahor person becomes Tamei.</p>
<p class="bas indent1"><span class="nm">(g)</span><span class="cl">Question:</span> What is the reason?</p>
<p class="bas indent1"><span class="nm">(h)</span><span class="cl">Answer:</span> "V'Chol Asher <i>Yiga</i> Bo ha'Zav v'Yadav Lo Shataf ba'Mayim" refers to Heset of a Zav (something that he moved). This is the only source for such a Tum'ah in the Torah. It is called Negi'ah (touching) to teach that Heset and Negi'ah are like Yadav (his hands), i.e. exposed. (When a Tahor moves the Zav, he becomes Tamei due to (standard) Masa, even from Beis ha'Starim.)</p>
<p class="bas indent1"><span class="nm">(i)</span><span class="cl">(Mishnah):</span> A Zav or Ba'al Keri does not become Tamei (until the Zov or semen leaves his body).</p>
<p class="bas indent1"><span class="nm">(j)</span>We learn about a Zav from "Zav mi'Bsaro" -- the Zov must leave him;</p>
<p class="bas indent1"><span class="nm">(k)</span>We learn about a Ba'al Keri from "v'Ish Ki Setzei Mimenu Shichvas Zera		."</p>
<p class="bas indent1"><span class="nm">(l)</span><span class="cl">(Mishnah):</span> If a man was eating Terumah and felt his semen moving (it is about to come out), he should hold his Ever tightly (to delay the emission) until he swallows the Terumah. (If he would spit it out, it would become repulsive.)</p>
<p class="bas indent1"><span class="nm">(m)</span><span class="cl">Contradiction (Beraisa - R. Eliezer):</span> One who holds his Ever while urinating causes (emission of semen, like the sin of the generation punished by) a Mabul (flood)!</p>
<p class="bas indent1"><span class="nm">(n)</span><span class="cl">Answer #1 (Abaye):</span> The Mishnah permits holding the Ever only through a thick cloth.</p>
<p class="bas indent1"><span class="nm">(o)</span><span class="cl">Answer #2 (Rava):</span> He may use even a thin cloth. Once the semen starts moving, it will come out in any case.</p>
<p class="bas indent2"><span class="nm">1.</span>Abaye forbids, lest this cause more semen to come out.</p>
<p class="bas indent2"><span class="nm">2.</span>Rava holds that once the semen starts moving, holding the Ever will not cause more to come out.</p>
<p class="bas indent1"><span class="nm">(p)</span><span class="cl">Question (against Rava - Beraisa):</span> This is like putting a finger in the eye. As long as it is in, it causes more tears to come out.</p>
<p class="bas indent1"><span class="nm">(q)</span><span class="cl">Answer:</span> (That applies to one who warms the Ever.) However, once the body was agitated (and semen started moving), it is unlikely that further warming will cause more to come out.</p>
<p class="bas subject"><span class="nm">2)</span><i>SEMEN</i> THAT WAS NOT FELT</p>
<p class="bas indent1"><span class="nm">(a)</span><span class="cl">Version #1 (Shmuel):</span> If a man's entire body does not feel semen exuding, it is not Tamei.</p>
<p class="bas indent1"><span class="nm">(b)</span><span class="cl">Question:</span> What is the reason?</p>
<p class="bas indent1"><span class="nm">(c)</span><span class="cl">Answer:</span> The Torah calls it Shichvas Zera. It must be able to be Mazri'a (produce a child).</p>
<p class="bas indent1"><span class="nm">(d)</span><span class="cl">Question (Mishnah):</span> If a man thought about a woman at night, and found the Ever warm, he is Tamei (even though he did not feel anything)!</p>
<p class="bas indent1"><span class="nm">(e)</span><span class="cl">Answer (Rav Huna):</span> The case is, he dreamed that he had Bi'ah with a woman. Surely, (if semen came out) he felt it.</p>
<p class="bas indent1"><span class="nm">(f)</span><span class="cl">Version #2 (Shmuel):</span> If semen does not shoot out like an arrow, it is not Tamei.</p>
<p class="bas indent1"><span class="nm">(g)</span><span class="cl">Question:</span> What is the difference between these versions?</p>
<p class="bas indent1"><span class="nm">(h)</span><span class="cl">Answer:</span> They argue about one who felt the semen start to move, but did not feel it come out. (Version #1 is Metamei, and Version #2 is Metaher.)</p>
<p class="bas indent1"><span class="nm">(i)</span>Rava was unsure about this;</p>
<p class="bas indent2"><span class="nm">1.</span><span class="cl">Question (Rava):</span> If he felt when the semen started moving, but not when it came out, what is the law?</p>
<p class="bas indent2"><span class="nm">2.</span><span class="cl">Answer (Mishnah):</span> If a Ba'al Keri did not urinate (after the emission) and immersed, when he next urinates he is Tamei. (A remaining drop of semen comes out with the urine. Even though he does not feel, it is Metamei him!)</p>
<p class="bas indent2"><span class="nm">3.</span><span class="cl">Rejection:</span> There is different. He felt most of the semen come out, therefore the remaining drop is Metamei even if he does not feel it.</p>
<p class="bas indent1"><span class="nm">(j)</span><span class="cl">Version #3 (Shmuel):</span> If semen does not shoot out like an arrow, it cannot be Mazri'a (impregnate).</p>
<p class="bas indent1"><span class="nm">(k)</span><span class="cl">Inference:</span> It cannot be Mazri'a, but it is Metamei. "Ki Yiyeheh Vecha Ish... <i>Mikreh</i> Lailah" discusses any case.</p>
<p class="bas indent1"><span class="nm">(l)</span><span class="cl">Question (Rava):</span> If semen of a Nochri started to flow, and it came out after he immersed (to convert), what is the law?</p>
<p class="bas indent2"><span class="nm">1.</span>Even if we say that Tum'ah depends on (feeling) the start (of the flow of Dam Nidah), perhaps this is only to be stringent (to be Metamei even what came out later without Hargashah), but we are not Metaher because he was a Nochri (whose semen is Tahor) at the start;</p>
<p class="bas indent2"><span class="nm">2.</span>Or, perhaps everything depends on the start, and it is Tahor?</p>
<p class="bas indent2"><span class="nm">3.</span>This question is not resolved.</p>
<p class="bas indent1"><span class="nm">(m)</span><span class="cl">Question (Rava):</span> If urine of a Zavah started to flow, and it came out after she immersed, what is the law?</p>
<p class="bas indent2"><span class="nm">1.</span>Even if we say that Tum'ah depends on the start, perhaps this is only regarding semen, for a man cannot stop it from leaving, but one can hold in urine. (Therefore, it depends only on when it came out, and she was Tehorah then);</p>
<p class="bas indent2"><span class="nm">2.</span>Or, perhaps we do not distinguish urine from semen?</p>
<p class="bas indent1"><span class="nm">(n)</span>This question is not resolved.</p>
<p class="bas indent1"><span class="nm">(o)</span><span class="cl">Question (Rava):</span> If urine of a Nochris (mid'Rabanan she is considered a) Zavah started to flow, and it came out after she immersed (to convert), what is the law?</p>
<p class="bas bbbline">43b----------------------------------------43b</p>
<p class="bas indent2"><span class="nm">1.</span>Even if we say that Tum'ah depends on the start, even though she can stop it from leaving, perhaps this applies only to Tum'ah mid'Oraisa of a Yisraelis, but we are not stringent about Tum'ah mid'Rabanan of a Nochris;</p>
<p class="bas indent2"><span class="nm">2.</span>Or, perhaps we do not distinguish?</p>
<p class="bas indent1"><span class="nm">(p)</span>This question is not resolved.</p>
<p class="bas subject"><span class="nm">3)</span>HOW MUCH <i>SEMEN</i> IS <i>METAMEI</i>?</p>
<p class="bas indent1"><span class="nm">(a)</span><span class="cl">(Mishnah):</span> Any amount (of Zov or semen) is Metamei.</p>
<p class="bas indent1"><span class="nm">(b)</span><span class="cl">(Shmuel):</span> Zov is not Metamei unless there is Chatimas (enough to fill the opening of) ha'Ever -- "Oh <i>Hechtim</i> Besaro mi'Zovo."</p>
<p class="bas indent1"><span class="nm">(c)</span><span class="cl">Question (Mishnah):</span> Any amount is Tamei.</p>
<p class="bas indent1"><span class="nm">(d)</span><span class="cl">Answer:</span> Shmuel holds like R. Nasan;</p>
<p class="bas indent2"><span class="nm">1.</span><span class="cl">(Beraisa - R. Nasan citing R. Yishmael):</span> Zov is not Metamei unless there is Chatimas ha'Ever;</p>
<p class="bas indent2"><span class="nm">2.</span>Chachamim disagree.</p>
<p class="bas indent1"><span class="nm">(e)</span>R. Yishmael learns from "Oh Hechtim Besaro mi'Zovo";</p>
<p class="bas indent2"><span class="nm">1.</span>Chachamim learn from this that Zov is Metamei when it is wet, but not if it is dry.</p>
<p class="bas indent2"><span class="nm">2.</span>R. Yishmael learns this from "Rar."</p>
<p class="bas indent2"><span class="nm">3.</span>Chachamim use "Rar" to teach that a Zav brings a Korban only after three emissions -- "Zovo (1)... Rar Besaro (2) Es Zovo (3)";</p>
<p class="bas indent3"><span class="nm">i.</span>"Oh Hechtim Besaro <i>mi</i>'Zovo" teaches that a Zav who saw two emissions is Metamei Mishkav u'Moshav.</p>
<p class="bas indent2"><span class="nm">4.</span>R. Yishmael learns that a Zav who saw three emissions brings a Korban, as R. Simai does;</p>
<p class="bas indent3"><span class="nm">i.</span><span class="cl">(Beraisa - R. Simai):</span> The Torah calls a Zav Tamei after two sightings, and also after three;</p>
<p class="bas indent3"><span class="nm">ii.</span>After two sightings he is (fully) Tamei. After three he brings a Korban.</p>
<p class="bas indent2"><span class="nm">5.</span><span class="cl">Question:</span> Another Tana learns both of these from "Zos Tiheyeh Tum'aso b'Zovo." What does he learn from "Ki Yiyeheh Zav mi'Bsaro"?</p>
<p class="bas indent2"><span class="nm">6.</span><span class="cl">Answer:</span> He learns that he is not Tamei until it leaves his body.</p>
<p class="bas indent2"><span class="nm">7.</span><span class="cl">Question:</span> What does he learn from "Zovo Tamei"?</p>
<p class="bas indent2"><span class="nm">8.</span><span class="cl">Answer:</span> This teaches that Zivah itself is Tamei.</p>
<p class="bas indent1"><span class="nm">(f)</span><span class="cl">(Rav Chanilai):</span> One who sees (has an emission of) semen of any amount becomes Tamei; one who touches semen becomes Tamei only if he touches k'Adashah.</p>
<p class="bas indent1"><span class="nm">(g)</span><span class="cl">Question:</span> The Mishnah says that any amount is Metamei!</p>
<p class="bas indent2"><span class="nm">1.</span><span class="cl">Suggestion:</span> This refers to touching.</p>
<p class="bas indent1"><span class="nm">(h)</span><span class="cl">Answer:</span> No, it refers to seeing.</p>
<p class="bas indent1"><span class="nm">(i)</span><span class="cl">Question (Beraisa):</span> In one respect semen is more stringent than a Sheretz. In another way it is more lenient:</p>
<p class="bas indent2"><span class="nm">1.</span>Semen is more lenient. Its Tum'ah is limited (this will be explained). A Sheretz is always Tamei;</p>
<p class="bas indent2"><span class="nm">2.</span>Semen is more stringent. Any amount of it is Metamei.</p>
<p class="bas indent2"><span class="nm">3.</span><span class="cl">Suggestion:</span> This refers to touching.</p>
<p class="bas indent1"><span class="nm">(j)</span><span class="cl">Answer:</span> No, it refers to seeing.</p>
<p class="bas indent1"><span class="nm">(k)</span><span class="cl">Objection:</span> The Beraisa considers this a stringency of semen over a Sheretz. Surely both refer to the same case (touching)!</p>
<p class="bas indent1"><span class="nm">(l)</span><span class="cl">Answer (Rav Ada bar Ahavah):</span> The stringency is that sometimes semen of any amount is Tamei, this never applies to a Sheretz.</p>
<p class="bas indent1"><span class="nm">(m)</span><span class="cl">Question:</span> A limb of a Sheretz of any size is Metamei!</p>
<p class="bas indent2"><span class="nm">1.</span><span class="cl">(Mishnah):</span> A (human) limb of any size is Tamei, even a less than a k'Zayis of a limb of one or Nevelah, or less than k'Adashah of a Sheretz.</p>
<p class="bas indent1"><span class="nm">(n)</span><span class="cl">Answer:</span> A limb is different, it is like k'Adashah. If any of the limb is missing, it is not Metamei. (Tosfos - therefore, this is not considered that "any amount" is Metamei.)</p>
<p class="bas indent1"><span class="nm">(o)</span><span class="cl">Question:</span> The Beraisa said "semen is more lenient, for its Tum'ah is limited." What does this mean?</p>
<p class="bas indent2"><span class="nm">1.</span><span class="cl">Suggestion:</span> Semen of a Yisrael is Tamei, but of a Nochri is not.</p>
<p class="bas indent2"><span class="nm">2.</span><span class="cl">Rejection:</span> Similarly, regarding Sheratzim, land mice are Teme'im, not sea mice!</p>
<p class="bas indent1"><span class="nm">(p)</span><span class="cl">Answer:</span> Semen of a man (above nine years) is Tamei, but semen of a boy is not.</p>
<p class="bas indent1"><span class="nm">(q)</span><span class="cl">(Rav Papa):</span> Tana'im argue about Rav Chanilai's law.</p>
<p class="bas indent2"><span class="nm">1.</span><span class="cl">(Beraisa):</span> "Oh Ish" -- one who touches semen becomes Tamei. (We are thinking that we cite the verse "Oh Ish" in Parshas Sheratzim.)</p>
<p class="bas indent2"><span class="nm">2.</span>We know that Tana'im argue (in general) whether Dun Minah u'Minah (when a matter is learned from another matter, we learn everything from the source) or Dun Minah v'Uki b'Asra (we learn only one law from the source, but other laws are according to the matter being learned).</p>
<p class="bas indent2"><span class="nm">3.</span>According to the opinion that Dun Minah u'Minah, we learn that semen is Metamei one who touches it, just like a Sheretz. We learn also that k'Adashah is Metamei;</p>
<p class="bas indent2"><span class="nm">4.</span>According to the opinion that Dun Minah v'Uki b'Asra, we learn that semen is Metamei one who touches it, just like a Sheretz, but we learn from one who sees Keri that any amount is Metamei.</p>
<p class="bas indent1"><span class="nm">(r)</span><span class="cl">Rejection (Rav Huna brei d'Rav Nasan):</span> Perhaps this refers to "Oh Ish" in the Parshah of semen, all agree that we learn from one who sees that any amount is Metamei!</p>

<p class="bas indent1"><span class="nm">(a)</span><span class="cl">(Mishnah):</span> A one-day old girl can become a Nidah. A 10-day old can become a Zavah;</p>
<p class="bas indent1"><span class="nm">(b)</span>A one-day old boy can become a Zav;</p>
<p class="bas indent1"><span class="nm">(c)</span>A one-day old can become a Metzora or Tamei Mes. He obligates his brother's widow (to wait until he matures) to do Yibum (or Chalitzah). He exempts his mother from Yibum. (If he is a Kohen) he permits (his mother) to eat Terumah, and he forbids (someone -- this will be explained) to eat Terumah;</p>
<p class="bas indent2"><span class="nm">1.</span>He inherits and bequeaths. One who kills him is liable;</p>
