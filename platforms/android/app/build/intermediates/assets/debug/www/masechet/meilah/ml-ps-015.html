<p class="bas subject"><span class="nm">1)</span>WHAT COMBINES FOR <i>ME'ILAH</i></p>
<p class="bas indent1"><span class="nm">(a)</span><span class="cl">(Mishnah):</span> Kodshei Mizbe'ach join with each other for Me'ilah, Pigul, Nosar and Tamei (if one ate, or regarding Me'ilah benefited from) a half-Shi'ur from each of two different Korbanos, he is liable;</p>
<p class="bas indent1"><span class="nm">(b)</span>Kodshei Bedek ha'Bayis join with each other (for Me'ilah);</p>
<p class="bas indent1"><span class="nm">(c)</span>Kodshei Mizbe'ach and Kodshei Bedek ha'Bayis are like one. They join for Me'ilah.</p>
<p class="bas indent1"><span class="nm">(d)</span><span class="cl">(Gemara) Question:</span> Since the Seifa teaches that Kodshei Mizbe'ach and Kodshei Bedek ha'Bayis join for Me'ilah like one, even though one is Kedushas ha'Guf and the other Kedushas Damim, there is no need to say that Kodshei Mizbe'ach join with each other! (Tosfos - this is included in saying that they are like one.)</p>
<p class="bas indent1"><span class="nm">(e)</span><span class="cl">Answer:</span> The Tana needed to teach that Kodshei Mizbe'ach join also for Pigul, Nosar and Tamei, therefore he had to teach a clause just for them. (For parallel structure, he taught a clause just for Kodshei Bedek ha'Bayis.)</p>
<p class="bas indent1"><span class="nm">(f)</span><span class="cl">(R. Yanai):</span> One is liable for Me'ilah only for Kodshei Bedek ha'Bayis (and Olah - Tosfos and Shitah delete this from the text).</p>
<p class="bas indent1"><span class="nm">(g)</span><span class="cl">Question:</span> What is the reason?</p>
<p class="bas indent1"><span class="nm">(h)</span><span class="cl">Answer:</span> "Nefesh Ki Sim'ol Ma'al... mi'Kodshei Hash-m" teaches that Me'ilah applies to Kodshim that are wholly for Hash-m, but not to Kodshei Mizbe'ach, for parts of them go to Kohanim or to the owner.</p>
<p class="bas indent1"><span class="nm">(i)</span><span class="cl">Question (Mishnah):</span> Kodshei Mizbe'ach join with each other for Me'ilah.</p>
<p class="bas indent1"><span class="nm">(j)</span><span class="cl">Answer:</span> This refers to Me'ilah mid'Rabanan.</p>
<p class="bas indent1"><span class="nm">(k)</span><span class="cl">Question (Mishnah):</span> Me'ilah applies to Kodshei Kodashim slaughtered in the south.</p>
<p class="bas indent1"><span class="nm">(l)</span><span class="cl">Answer:</span> This refers to Me'ilah mid'Rabanan.</p>
<p class="bas indent1"><span class="nm">(m)</span><span class="cl">Question (Mishnah):</span> If one benefited from a live Chatas (a Ba'al Mum), he was not Mo'el unless he was Pogem (decreased its value). If one benefited from a dead Chatas, he was Mo'el, even if he was not Pogem.</p>
<p class="bas indent1"><span class="nm">(n)</span><span class="cl">Answer:</span> This refers to Me'ilah mid'Rabanan.</p>
<p class="bas indent1"><span class="nm">(o)</span><span class="cl">Question (Beraisa - Rebbi):</span> "Kol Chelev la'Shem" teaches that Me'ilah applies to Eimurim of Kodshim Kalim.</p>
<p class="bas indent1"><span class="nm">(p)</span><span class="cl">Answer:</span> This refers to Me'ilah mid'Rabanan.</p>
<p class="bas indent1"><span class="nm">(q)</span><span class="cl">Question:</span> He learns from a verse!</p>
<p class="bas indent1"><span class="nm">(r)</span><span class="cl">Answer:</span> The verse is a mere Asmachta.</p>
<p class="bas indent1"><span class="nm">(s)</span><span class="cl">Question:</span> Ula said in R. Yochanan's name that if Kodshim died (without Shechitah), mid'Oraisa Me'ilah no longer applies to them!</p>
<p class="bas indent2"><span class="nm">1.</span><span class="cl">Question:</span> What Kodshim does he discuss?</p>
<p class="bas indent3"><span class="nm">i.</span><span class="cl">Suggestion:</span> He discusses Kodshei Bedek ha'Bayis.</p>
<p class="bas indent3"><span class="nm">ii.</span><span class="cl">Rejection:</span> Surely, Me'ilah applies mid'Oraisa to a carcass of Bedek ha'Bayis, just like it applies to manure Hukdash for Bedek ha'Bayis!</p>
<p class="bas indent2"><span class="nm">2.</span><span class="cl">Answer:</span> He refers to Kodshei Mizbe'ach. (Note - normally, the Gemara does not challenge an Amora from the teaching of another Amora, especially from his Talmid! Matan b'Seser answers that the Gemara questions how R. Yochanan could argue with his Rebbi (R. Yanai). This is difficult, for Amora'im (including R. Yochanan, e.g. 5a above) often argue with their teachers. Also, Rashi and R. Gershom explicitly say that the question is against R. Yanai. Perhaps we challenge R. Yanai because we could not explain the Mishnah (2a) without R. Yochanan's teaching. Also, no one argues with R. Yochanan (see Tosfos 16b, DH v'Kalsei) - <b>PF</b>.)</p>
<p class="bas indent1"><span class="nm">(t)</span><span class="cl">Correction:</span> R. Yanai means that the verse ("Nefesh Ki Sim'ol Ma'al... mi'Kodshei Hash-m") teaches only that there is Me'ilah for Kodshei Bedek ha'Bayis, but not for Kodshei Mizbe'ach. (We learn the latter from "Ish Ki Yochal Kodesh" or "Kol Chelev la'Shem.")</p>

<p class="bas subject"><span class="nm">2)</span>WHAT COMBINES IN A KORBAN</p>
<p class="bas indent1"><span class="nm">(a)</span><span class="cl">(Mishnah):</span> Five things offered in (or with) an Olah join (for a Shi'ur of Pigul, Nosar or Tamei) -- the meat, Chelev, flour, wine and oil. The last three comprise the Nesachim. Rashi says that they join also for a Shi'ur for Ha'alas Chutz (offering outside the Mikdash). Tosfos (Zevachim 109a) disagrees. The Mishnah does not discuss joining for Me'ilah, for the next clause discusses Todah, and Me'ilah does not apply to its meat or bread.)</p>
<p class="bas indent1"><span class="nm">(b)</span>Six things offered in (or with) Todah join -- the meat, Chelev, flour, wine, oil and Lachmei Todah.</p>
<p class="bas indent1"><span class="nm">(c)</span><span class="cl">(Gemara):</span> Rav Huna was teaching our Mishnah to Rava. His text read "five things <i>b'Olam</i> join" (i.e. but never more. Alternatively, five things join with regard to all laws, including Tum'as Ochlim of Chulin).</p>
<p class="bas indent1"><span class="nm">(d)</span><span class="cl">Objection:</span> It says that six things of Todah join -- the meat, Chelev, flour, wine, oil and Lachmei Todah!</p>
<p class="bas indent1"><span class="nm">(e)</span><span class="cl">Correction:</span> Rather, it should say "five things <i>b'Olah</i> join."</p>
<p class="bas indent1"><span class="nm">(f)</span>Our Mishnah teaches like the following Beraisa;</p>
<p class="bas indent2"><span class="nm">1.</span><span class="cl">(Beraisa):</span> Meat and Eimurim of an Olah join to a k'Zayis to be liable for Ha'alas Chutz, and for Pigul, Nosar and Tamei.</p>
<p class="bas indent2"><span class="nm">2.</span><span class="cl">Inference:</span> Meat and Eimurim of an Olah join, but of Shelamim do not join.</p>
<p class="bas indent2"><span class="nm">3.</span><span class="cl">Question:</span> We understand why meat and Eimurim of Shelamim do not join for Ha'alas Chutz. (The meat is not offered in the Mikdash.) Why don't they join for Pigul, Nosar and Tamei?</p>
<p class="bas indent3"><span class="nm">i.</span><span class="cl">(Mishnah):</span> All Pigulim join. All Nosarim join.</p>
<p class="bas indent2"><span class="nm">4.</span><span class="cl">Answer:</span> The Beraisa means, meat and Eimurim of an Olah join (to the Shi'ur of k'Zayis) to allow Zerikah to be performed, to enable one to be liable for Pigul, Nosar and Tamei.</p>
<p class="bas indent2"><span class="nm">5.</span><span class="cl">Question:</span> Who is the Tana of the Beraisa?</p>
<p class="bas indent2"><span class="nm">6.</span><span class="cl">Answer:</span> It is R. Yehoshua:</p>
<p class="bas indent3"><span class="nm">i.</span><span class="cl">(Beraisa - R. Yehoshua):</span> If a k'Zayis of meat or a k'Zayis of Chelev of any Korban remains, we do Zerikah;</p>
<p class="bas indent3"><span class="nm">ii.</span>If half a k'Zayis of meat and half a k'Zayis of Chelev remain, we may not do Zerikah. The only exception is Olah. Since all of it is Huktar, the meat and Chelev join to allow Zerikah.</p>
<p class="bas indent3"><span class="nm">iii.</span>Regarding a Minchah, even if it is totally intact we do not do Zerikah.</p>
<p class="bas indent3"><span class="nm">iv.</span><span class="cl">Question:</span> There is no Zerikah for a Minchah!</p>
<p class="bas indent3"><span class="nm">v.</span><span class="cl">Answer (Rav Papa):</span> The Beraisa refers to Minchas Nesachim (that accompanies a Korban. One might have thought that it is like part of the Korban, and if no meat or Chelev remains, we may do Zerikah due to the Minchah. The Beraisa teaches that this is not so.)</p>
<p class="bas subject"><span class="nm">3)</span>THINGS THAT ARE CALLED <i>TERUMAH</i></p>
<p class="bas indent1"><span class="nm">(a)</span>(If Terumah is mixed with less than 100 times as much Chulin, or if Se'or (sourdough) of Terumah fermented a Chulin dough, all must be eaten by Kohanim in Taharah, like Terumah.)</p>
<p class="bas indent1"><span class="nm">(b)</span><span class="cl">(Mishnah):</span> The following join to forbid (a mixture like Terumah) and to obligate a Chomesh (if a non-Kohen ate a k'Zayis (some say - Perutah's worth) of them, he repays what he ate plus a Chomesh):</p>
<p class="bas indent2"><span class="nm">1.</span>Terumah, Terumas Ma'aser, Terumas Ma'aser of Demai (doubtfully tithed produce), Chalah and Bikurim.</p>
<p class="bas indent1"><span class="nm">(c)</span>All Pigulim join with each other. All Nosarim join with each other.</p>
<p class="bas indent1"><span class="nm">(d)</span><span class="cl">(Gemara) Question:</span> Why do all of these join (like Terumah)?</p>
<p class="bas indent1"><span class="nm">(e)</span><span class="cl">Answer:</span> All of them are called Terumah:</p>
<p class="bas indent2"><span class="nm">1.</span>Regarding Chalah it says "Reishis Arisosechem Chalah Tarimu Serumah";</p>
<p class="bas indent2"><span class="nm">2.</span><span class="cl">(Beraisa):</span> "U'Serumas Yadecha" refers to Bikurim;</p>
<p class="bas indent2"><span class="nm">3.</span>We need not explain the others. (They are explicitly called Terumah.)</p>
