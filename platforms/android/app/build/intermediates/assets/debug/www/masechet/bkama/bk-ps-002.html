<p class="bas subject"><span class="nm">1)</span>THE AVOS NEZIKIN</p>
<p class="bas indent1"><span class="nm">(a)</span><span class="cl">(Mishnah):</span> There are four Avos Nezikin (primary categories of damagers): an ox, a pit, Mav'eh (explained below), and fire.</p>
<p class="bas indent2"><span class="nm">1.</span>Re'i of an ox is unlike that of Mav'eh, and vice- versa. (Usually, Re'i refers to a stringency. Initially, the Gemara understands that here it refers to a leniency.)</p>
<p class="bas indent2"><span class="nm">2.</span>Re'i of these two, which are alive, is unlike that of fire, which is not;</p>
<p class="bas indent2"><span class="nm">3.</span>Re'i of these three, which move and damage, is unlike that of a pit, which does not;</p>
<p class="bas indent2"><span class="nm">4.</span>The common side of all four is that their nature is to damage, and you are obligated to guard them. If they damaged, the damager must pay from Meitav (highest quality land).</p>
<p class="bas subject"><span class="nm">2)</span>THE <i>TOLDOS</i></p>
<p class="bas indent1"><span class="nm">(a)</span><span class="cl">(Gemara) Inference:</span> If these are Avos, there must be Toldos (offshoots).</p>
<p class="bas indent1"><span class="nm">(b)</span><span class="cl">Question:</span> Are the Toldos like the Avos, or not?</p>
<p class="bas indent2"><span class="nm">1.</span><span class="cl">(Mishnah):</span> (Regarding Shabbos) there are 39 Avos Melachos. The Toldos are like the Avos;</p>
<p class="bas indent3"><span class="nm">i.</span>The punishment for either is stoning (if Mezid) or a Korban Chatas (if Shogeg).</p>
<p class="bas indent2"><span class="nm">2.</span><span class="cl">Question:</span> What difference does it make if they are Avos or Toldos?</p>
<p class="bas indent2"><span class="nm">3.</span><span class="cl">Answer:</span> If someone did two Avos or two Toldos (of different Melachos, b'Shogeg), he brings two Chata'os;</p>
<p class="bas indent3"><span class="nm">i.</span>If he did an Av and a Toldah of that same Melachah, he only brings one Korban.</p>
<p class="bas indent2"><span class="nm">4.</span><span class="cl">Question:</span> R. Eliezer says that in all cases, he brings a Korban for every Melachah. How does he explain the difference between Avos and Toldos?</p>
<p class="bas indent2"><span class="nm">5.</span><span class="cl">Answer:</span> Those that were done in the Mishkan are important, so they are called Avos. The others are less important, so they are called Toldos.</p>
<p class="bas indent2"><span class="nm">6.</span><span class="cl">(Mishnah):</span> Avos ha'Tum'ah (include) Sheratzim (rodents), semen, and one who became Tamei through a corpse.</p>
<p class="bas bbbline">2b----------------------------------------2b</p>
<p class="bas indent2"><span class="nm">7.</span>The Tum'os are unlike the Avos. An Av ha'Tum'ah is Metamei people and Kelim. A Toldah does not.</p>
<p class="bas indent1"><span class="nm">(c)</span><span class="cl">Answer (Rav Papa):</span> Regarding Nezikin, some Toldos are like the Avos, and others are not.</p>
<p class="bas subject"><span class="nm">3)</span>KEREN AND ITS TOLDOS</p>
<p class="bas indent1"><span class="nm">(a)</span><span class="cl">(Beraisa):</span> Three Avos pertain to an ox: Keren (the horn, i.e. goring), Shen (eating) and Regel (trampling).</p>
<p class="bas indent1"><span class="nm">(b)</span><span class="cl">Question:</span> What is the source for Keren?</p>
<p class="bas indent1"><span class="nm">(c)</span><span class="cl">Answer (Beraisa):</span> "If an ox will gore" - goring is with the horns.</p>
<p class="bas indent2"><span class="nm">1.</span>We learn from "he made for him... horns... 'with these you will gore Aram'" and "... his horns, with them he will gore nations".</p>
<p class="bas indent2"><span class="nm">2.</span><span class="cl">Question:</span> Why is a second verse needed?</p>
<p class="bas indent2"><span class="nm">3.</span><span class="cl">Answer #1:</span> If you will say that mid'Oraisa laws are not learned from Nevi'im, we can learn from a verse of the Torah.</p>
<p class="bas indent2"><span class="nm">4.</span><span class="cl">Objection:</span> We are not learning a law. We just clarify that goring is with a Keren!</p>
<p class="bas indent2"><span class="nm">5.</span><span class="cl">Answer #2:</span> Rather, one might have thought that the Torah distinguishes between a Mu'ad (an animal established to gore) and a Tam regarding detached horns, but if the horns are attached, it is always considered Mu'ad;</p>
<p class="bas indent3"><span class="nm">i.</span>"His horns..." teaches that this is not so. (It calls goring with attached horns 'Negichah', the same word used to discuss a Tam or Mu'ad that gored.)</p>
<p class="bas indent1"><span class="nm">(d)</span><span class="cl">Question:</span> What are the Toldos of Keren?</p>
<p class="bas indent1"><span class="nm">(e)</span><span class="cl">Answer:</span> They are pushing, biting, crouching and kicking.</p>
<p class="bas indent1"><span class="nm">(f)</span><span class="cl">Question:</span> Why is only goring an Av?</p>
<p class="bas indent2"><span class="nm">1.</span><span class="cl">Suggestion:</span> It is because it says "if (an ox) will gore..." 2.  Rejection: It also says "if will push"!</p>
<p class="bas indent1"><span class="nm">(g)</span><span class="cl">Answer:</span> The latter verse also refers to goring.</p>
<p class="bas indent2"><span class="nm">1.</span><span class="cl">(Beraisa):</span> The Torah first says "Yigach (gore)" and later "Yigof" to teach that both are the same.</p>
<p class="bas indent1"><span class="nm">(h)</span><span class="cl">Question:</span> Why does it say "Yigach" regarding goring people and "Yigof" regarding goring animals?</p>
<p class="bas indent1"><span class="nm">(i)</span><span class="cl">Answer:</span> Man has Mazal (understanding to guard himself; alternatively, an angel that advocates for him), so it says "Yigach" (he would not be gored unless the animal intended). Animals lack Mazal, so it says "Yigof" (it could be gored without intent).</p>
<p class="bas indent2"><span class="nm">1.</span>This teaches that an animal Mu'ad to gore people is (also) Mu'ad to gore animals, but not vice-versa.</p>
<p class="bas indent1"><span class="nm">(j)</span><span class="cl">Question:</span> Why is biting a Toldah of Keren? It is a Toldah of Shen (eating)!</p>
<p class="bas indent1"><span class="nm">(k)</span><span class="cl">Answer:</span> No. Shen is when the animal has Hana'ah (benefit or pleasure). The animal gets no Hana'ah from biting.</p>
<p class="bas indent1"><span class="nm">(l)</span><span class="cl">Question:</span> Why are crouching and kicking Toldos of Keren? They are Toldos of Regel (trampling)!</p>
<p class="bas indent1"><span class="nm">(m)</span><span class="cl">Answer:</span> No. Regel is common damage. Crouching and kicking are not common.</p>
<p class="bas subject"><span class="nm">4)</span><i>TOLDOS</i> UNLIKE THE <i>AV</i></p>
<p class="bas indent1"><span class="nm">(a)</span><span class="cl">Question:</span> Rav Papa said that some Toldos are unlike the Avos. To which did he refer?</p>
<p class="bas indent2"><span class="nm">1.</span>He cannot refer to these Toldos of Keren. Keren has intent to damage, it is your property, and you are responsible to watch it. The same applies to these Toldos!</p>
<p class="bas indent1"><span class="nm">(b)</span><span class="cl">Answer #1:</span> Rather, the Toldos of Keren are like Keren. Toldos of Shen and Regel are unlike those Avos.</p>
<p class="bas indent1"><span class="nm">(c)</span><span class="cl">(Beraisa):</span> "He will send" refers to Regel - "sending the Regel of oxen and donkeys."</p>
<p class="bas indent2"><span class="nm">1.</span>"And it will consume" refers to Shen - "like the Galal (tooth) will consume"</p>
