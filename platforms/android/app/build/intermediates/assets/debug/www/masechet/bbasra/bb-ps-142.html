<p class="bas subject"><span class="nm">1)</span>KINYAN ON BEHALF OF A FETUS (cont.)</p>
<p class="bas indent1"><span class="nm">(a)</span><span class="cl">(Rav Nachman):</span> If one acquires on behalf of a fetus, the fetus does not acquire;</p>
<p class="bas indent2"><span class="nm">1.</span>If the giver said '<i>when</i> she will give birth...', the baby acquires.</p>
<p class="bas indent1"><span class="nm">(b)</span><span class="cl">(Rav Huna):</span> Even if he said '<i>when</i> she will give birth...', the baby does not acquire.</p>
<p class="bas indent1"><span class="nm">(c)</span><span class="cl">(Rav Sheshes):</span> In both cases, the baby acquires.</p>
<p class="bas indent1"><span class="nm">(d)</span><span class="cl">Support (Rav Sheshes for himself - Beraisa):</span> If a convert died, and Yisre'elim grabbed his property.</p>
<p class="bas indent2"><span class="nm">1.</span>If they heard that he left a son, or that his wife was pregnant, they must return it;</p>
<p class="bas indent2"><span class="nm">2.</span>If after they returned it, they heard that the son died or that the wife miscarried, the first Kinyanim are void. What anyone takes now, he keeps.</p>
<p class="bas indent2"><span class="nm">3.</span>If a fetus did not acquire, the first Kinyanim would be valid (even after they heard that his wife was pregnant)!</p>
<p class="bas indent1"><span class="nm">(e)</span><span class="cl">Rejection #1 (Abaye):</span> Inheritance is different, for it happens automatically.</p>
<p class="bas indent1"><span class="nm">(f)</span><span class="cl">Rejection #2 (Rava):</span> There, the initial Kinyanim were invalid (because they did not know whether or not there were heirs).</p>
<p class="bas indent1"><span class="nm">(g)</span><span class="cl">Question:</span> What is the difference between Abaye and Rava?</p>
<p class="bas indent1"><span class="nm">(h)</span><span class="cl">Answer:</span> They argue in a case when people heard that the fetus died, grabbed property, and it turned out that the fetus died only after they grabbed, and others grabbed property after the fetus (truly) died. (According to Rava, the first people acquire, for they were sure that there were no heirs. According to Abaye, the second people acquire.)</p>
<p class="bas subject"><span class="nm">2)</span>DOES A FETUS INHERIT?</p>
<p class="bas indent1"><span class="nm">(a)</span><span class="cl">Question (against Rav Sheshes - Mishnah):</span> A one-day old baby inherits and bequeaths.</p>
<p class="bas indent2"><span class="nm">1.</span><span class="cl">Inference:</span> Less than one day (i.e. a fetus) does not inherit!</p>
<p class="bas indent1"><span class="nm">(b)</span><span class="cl">Answer #1 (Rav Sheshes):</span> A one-day old baby inherits his mother's property to bequeath it to his paternal brothers, but a fetus does not.</p>
<p class="bas indent2"><span class="nm">1.</span><span class="cl">Question:</span> Why not?</p>
<p class="bas bbbline">142b----------------------------------------142b</p>
<p class="bas indent2"><span class="nm">2.</span><span class="cl">Answer:</span> The fetus always dies before the mother. A son does not 'inherit' his mother after his own death in order that the property should pass to his paternal brothers.</p>
<p class="bas indent2"><span class="nm">3.</span><span class="cl">Question:</span> Is it really true that the fetus dies first?!</p>
<p class="bas indent3"><span class="nm">i.</span>There was a case of a fetus that quivered three times after its mother died!</p>
<p class="bas indent2"><span class="nm">4.</span><span class="cl">Answer (Mar bar Rav Ashi):</span> Quivering does not show that it is alive. If a rodent's tail is cut off, also it quivers!</p>
<p class="bas indent1"><span class="nm">(c)</span><span class="cl">Answer #2 (Mar brei d'Rav Yosef):</span> A one-day old baby is considered a son in the calculation of the extra share of the firstborn.</p>
<p class="bas indent2"><span class="nm">1.</span><span class="cl">Inference:</span> A fetus does not decrease the extra share of the firstborn. "V'Yoldu Lo" (we consider only sons who were already born when the father died).</p>
<p class="bas indent1"><span class="nm">(d)</span><span class="cl">Version #1 - Chachamim of Sura (Mar brei d'Rav Yosef):</span> A son born posthumously does not decrease the extra share of the firstborn - "v'Yoldu Lo".</p>
<p class="bas indent1"><span class="nm">(e)</span><span class="cl">Version #2 - Chachamim of Neharde'a (Mar brei d'Rav Yosef):</span> A firstborn born posthumously does not receive an extra share (e.g. if another son was also born posthumously) - "Yakir" (the father must (be fitting to) make known his firstborn. Here, he was unable to do so).</p>
<p class="bas indent1"><span class="nm">(f)</span>The Halachah follows Mar brei d'Rav Yosef in these three laws.</p>
<p class="bas indent1"><span class="nm">(g)</span><span class="cl">(R. Yitzchak):</span> If one acquires on behalf of a fetus, the fetus does not acquire;</p>
<p class="bas indent1"><span class="nm">(h)</span><span class="cl">Question:</span> The Mishnah says that the fetus acquires!</p>
<p class="bas indent1"><span class="nm">(i)</span><span class="cl">Answer:</span> The Mishnah discusses a man giving to his son. Because he feels great affinity for his son, he resolves more firmly to give, so the Kinyan works;</p>
<p class="bas indent2"><span class="nm">1.</span>In any other case, the fetus does not acquire.</p>
<p class="bas indent1"><span class="nm">(j)</span>Shmuel expounded in front of 10 people that if one acquires on behalf of a fetus, the fetus acquires.</p>
<p class="bas indent1"><span class="nm">(k)</span>The Halachah is, if one acquires on behalf of a fetus, the fetus does not acquire.</p>
<p class="bas subject"><span class="nm">3)</span>A GIFT FOR THE FUTURE</p>
<p class="bas indent1"><span class="nm">(a)</span>Yakov told his wife Sarah 'my property is to the sons I will have from you.' His oldest son (Reuven, from a different wife) asked 'what will I get?!' Yakov said 'go acquire like one of her sons.'</p>
<p class="bas indent2"><span class="nm">1.</span>Clearly, nothing takes effect now regarding Sarah's (future) sons. They are not yet in the world (she was not even pregnant).</p>
<p class="bas indent1"><span class="nm">(b)</span><span class="cl">Question:</span> (When Yakov dies,) does Reuven get an extra share of the estate (above his normal share) equal to what he would receive if he were a son of Sarah (and they received all the property)?</p>
<p class="bas indent1"><span class="nm">(c)</span><span class="cl">Answer #1 (R. Avin, R. Meisha, and R. Yirmeyah):</span> Yes, he gets an extra share.</p>
<p class="bas indent1"><span class="nm">(d)</span><span class="cl">Answer #2 (R. Avahu, R. Chanina bar Papa, R. Yitzchak Nafcha):</span> He does not get an extra share.</p>
<p class="bas indent1"><span class="nm">(e)</span><span class="cl">R. Avahu:</span> Does the Halachah follow you, or us?</p>
<p class="bas indent1"><span class="nm">(f)</span><span class="cl">R. Yirmeyah:</span> The Halachah follows us. We are older than you.</p>
<p class="bas indent1"><span class="nm">(g)</span><span class="cl">R. Avahu:</span> The Halachah does not depend on age, rather, on reason!</p>
<p class="bas indent1"><span class="nm">(h)</span><span class="cl">Question (R. Yirmeyah):</span> What is your reason?</p>
<p class="bas indent1"><span class="nm">(i)</span><span class="cl">Answer (R. Avahu):</span> It is as if he said to him 'acquire like the donkey.' (Since Sarah's sons cannot acquire, and he said 'acquire like her sons', also Reuven does not acquire.)</p>
