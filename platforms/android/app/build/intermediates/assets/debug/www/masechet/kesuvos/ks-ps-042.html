<p class="bas subject"><span class="nm">1)</span>WHO RECEIVES THE PAYMENTS? (cont.)</p>
<p class="bas indent1"><span class="nm">(a)</span><span class="cl">(Gemara) Question:</span> We already learned this!</p>
<p class="bas indent2"><span class="nm">1.</span><span class="cl">(Mishnah):</span> A seducer pays three things and a rapist pays four. A seducer pays embarrassment, blemish and fine, and a rapist also pays for pain.</p>
<p class="bas indent1"><span class="nm">(b)</span><span class="cl">Answer #1:</span> Our Mishnah teaches that the payments go to the father.</p>
<p class="bas indent1"><span class="nm">(c)</span><span class="cl">Objection:</span> This is obvious, since a seducer pays;</p>
<p class="bas indent2"><span class="nm">1.</span>If the payments were to her, why would he pay? She consented!</p>
<p class="bas indent1"><span class="nm">(d)</span><span class="cl">Answer #2:</span> Our Mishnah teaches the argument of R. Shimon and Chachamim when the father dies after the trial.</p>
<p class="bas subject"><span class="nm">2)</span>AN <i>ASHAM</i> FOR A FALSE OATH</p>
<p class="bas indent1"><span class="nm">(a)</span>(Mishnah) Reuven claimed against Shimon 'You raped (or seduced) my daughter!'</p>
<p class="bas indent2"><span class="nm">1.</span><span class="cl">Shimon:</span> I didn't!</p>
<p class="bas indent2"><span class="nm">2.</span><span class="cl">Reuven:</span> I impose an oath on you!</p>
<p class="bas indent2"><span class="nm">3.</span><span class="cl">Shimon:</span> Amen (I accept the oath).</p>
<p class="bas indent1"><span class="nm">(b)</span>Later, Shimon admitted that he swore falsely. He is liable (to pay the principal and a Chomesh (an added fifth) and to offer an Asham Gezeilos, the Korban for a false oath to deny a debt);</p>
<p class="bas indent1"><span class="nm">(c)</span>R. Shimon exempts, since one does not pay a fine due to his admission.</p>
<p class="bas indent2"><span class="nm">1.</span><span class="cl">Chachamim:</span> Even so, he pays embarrassment and blemish due to his admission.</p>
<p class="bas indent1"><span class="nm">(d)</span><span class="cl">Question (Abaye):</span> Would R. Shimon obligate (a Chomesh and an Asham) in the following case?</p>
<p class="bas indent2"><span class="nm">1.</span><span class="cl">Reuven:</span> You raped (or seduced) my daughter. I took you to trial, and you were obligated to pay!</p>
<p class="bas indent2"><span class="nm">2.</span><span class="cl">Shimon:</span> That is all false!</p>
<p class="bas indent2"><span class="nm">3.</span><span class="cl">Reuven:</span> I impose an oath on you!</p>
<p class="bas indent2"><span class="nm">4.</span><span class="cl">Shimon:</span> Amen.</p>
<p class="bas indent2"><span class="nm">5.</span>Since there already was a trial, the payment is like regular Mamon (so he is liable);</p>
<p class="bas indent3"><span class="nm">i.</span>Or, do we still consider it like a fine (so he pays only the principal)?</p>
<p class="bas indent1"><span class="nm">(e)</span><span class="cl">Answer (Rabah):</span> It is like Mamon.</p>
<p class="bas indent1"><span class="nm">(f)</span><span class="cl">Question (Abaye - Beraisa - R. Shimon):</span> Reuven claimed 'You raped (or seduced) my daughter', or 'your ox killed my slave';</p>
<p class="bas indent2"><span class="nm">1.</span><span class="cl">Shimon:</span> That is false!</p>
<p class="bas indent2"><span class="nm">2.</span><span class="cl">A slave (to his master):</span> You knocked out my tooth or blinded my eye!</p>
<p class="bas indent2"><span class="nm">3.</span><span class="cl">His master:</span> I didn't!</p>
<p class="bas indent2"><span class="nm">4.</span>Shimon or the master swore falsely and later admitted.</p>
<p class="bas indent2"><span class="nm">5.</span><span class="cl">Suggestion:</span> Perhaps he is liable (to bring an Asham)!</p>
<p class="bas indent2"><span class="nm">6.</span><span class="cl">Rejection:</span> "He denied a deposit, loan or theft... (which are Mamon)" - this excludes these cases, which are fines.</p>
<p class="bas bbbline">42b----------------------------------------42b</p>
<p class="bas indent2"><span class="nm">7.</span><span class="cl">Suggestion:</span> The case was already brought to trial.</p>
<p class="bas indent1"><span class="nm">(g)</span><span class="cl">Answer (Rabah):</span> No, it was not.</p>
<p class="bas indent1"><span class="nm">(h)</span><span class="cl">Question:</span> Since in the Reisha the case already went to trial, surely the same applies to the Seifa!</p>
<p class="bas indent2"><span class="nm">1.</span><span class="cl">(Reisha) Question:</span> We know (that one adds a Chomesh and brings an Asham for a false oath) about matters for which one pays (only) the principal. What is the source for a thief who pays double, four or five times the value, a rapist or seducer, and Motzi Shem Ra?</p>
<p class="bas indent2"><span class="nm">2.</span><span class="cl">Answer:</span> We learn from the repetition "u'Mo'alah Ma'al".</p>
<p class="bas indent2"><span class="nm">3.</span><span class="cl">Question:</span> What is the case?</p>
<p class="bas indent3"><span class="nm">i.</span>If there was not yet a trial, there is no obligation to pay double!</p>
<p class="bas indent2"><span class="nm">4.</span><span class="cl">Answer:</span> Rather, the case went to trial.</p>
<p class="bas indent2"><span class="nm">5.</span>Also in the Seifa, the case went to trial</p>
<p class="bas indent1"><span class="nm">(i)</span><span class="cl">Answer #1 (Rabah):</span> The entire Beraisa is R. Shimon. The Reisha is after trial and the Seifa is before trial.</p>
<p class="bas indent1"><span class="nm">(j)</span>Rabah:	This is a poor answer. If so, 'R. Shimon says' should appear at the beginning or end of the Beraisa (and not in the middle)! I will give you a better answer!</p>
<p class="bas indent1"><span class="nm">(k)</span><span class="cl">Answer #2 (Rabah):</span> The entire Beraisa is after trial. The Reisha is Chachamim and the Seifa is R. Shimon. I agree that R. Shimon exempts from an Asham due to "He denied a deposit..."</p>
<p class="bas indent2"><span class="nm">1.</span>I said that it is Mamon to teach that the father bequeaths it to his sons.</p>
<p class="bas indent1"><span class="nm">(l)</span><span class="cl">Question (Mishnah - R. Shimon):</span> If she did not collect until the father died, she keeps the payments!</p>
<p class="bas indent2"><span class="nm">1.</span>If it is like money to bequeath to the sons, her brothers should get the money!</p>
<p class="bas subject"><span class="nm">3)</span>THE QUESTION IS FINALLY ANSWERED</p>
<p class="bas indent1"><span class="nm">(a)</span><span class="cl">Rava:</span> Rabah and Rav Yosef could not answer this for 22 years. It was only answered when (Rabah died and) Rav Yosef became head of the Yeshivah.</p>
<p class="bas indent1"><span class="nm">(b)</span><span class="cl">Answer (Rav Yosef):</span> The fine of a rapist is different, since the Torah said "<i>v'Nasan</i> (he will give) to the father" - it is not considered the father's until it is given.</p>
<p class="bas indent2"><span class="nm">1.</span>Rabah said that <i>other</i> fines are Mamon to teach that the sons inherit them.</p>
<p class="bas indent1"><span class="nm">(c)</span><span class="cl">Question #1:</span> In the Parashah of a slave killed by an animal it says "<i>Yiten</i> (he will give)." Does the master merit it only after it is paid?!</p>
<p class="bas indent1"><span class="nm">(d)</span><span class="cl">Answer:</span> We only learn from the word "<i>v'Nasan"</i>, not from "<i>Yiten"</i>.</p>
<p class="bas indent1"><span class="nm">(e)</span><span class="cl">Question #2:</span> The Beraisa says that we learn from "He denied..." It should say that we learn from "v'Nasan"!</p>
<p class="bas indent1"><span class="nm">(f)</span><span class="cl">Answer (Rava):</span> "He denied..." teaches about (the exemption from an Asham) when after the trial she became a Bogeres and died. Her father inherits the fine <i>from her</i>. (Therefore, we cannot learn this from "v'Nasan l'Aviha".)</p>
<p class="bas indent1"><span class="nm">(g)</span><span class="cl">Question (Beraisa):</span> ... This excludes these cases, which are fines.</p>
<p class="bas indent2"><span class="nm">1.</span>If it discusses after the trial, they are Mamon!</p>
<p class="bas indent1"><span class="nm">(h)</span><span class="cl">Answer (Rav Nachman bar Yitzchak):</span> It means, this excludes these cases which were originally fines.</p>
<p class="bas indent1"><span class="nm">(i)</span><span class="cl">Question (Beraisa):</span> R. Shimon exempts (from the Asham) since he does not pay due to his admission.</p>
<p class="bas indent2"><span class="nm">1.</span>This applies only before the trial. After the trial he pays due to his admission, so he should bring an Asham!</p>
<p class="bas indent1"><span class="nm">(j)</span><span class="cl">Answer:</span> R. Shimon addresses the Chachamim according to their reasoning:</p>
<p class="bas indent2"><span class="nm">1.</span><span class="cl">R. Shimon:</span> I hold that even after the trial, the Torah exempts from "He denied..." You should agree with me that before the trial the claim is only a fine, and one who admits to a fine is exempt (so no Asham is brought)!</p>
<p class="bas indent2"><span class="nm">2.</span>Chachamim say that the father demands payment for embarrassment and blemish (Mamon).</p>
