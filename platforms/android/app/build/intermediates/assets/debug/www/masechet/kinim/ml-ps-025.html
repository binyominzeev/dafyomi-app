<p class=newsubafdaf><span class=numt>1)</span> MANY THAT COME FROM ONE</p>
<p class=firstindent><span class=numl1>(a)</span>	R. Yehoshua says, a live ram has only one voice. When it dies, the carcass produces seven voices;</p>
<p class=secondindent><span class=numl2>1.</span>	Each of the two horns becomes a Shofar. Each of the two thigh bones becomes a flute, the skin becomes a tambourine. The large intestines become lyre strings. Its small intestines become harp strings. (This is like the two Kinim, which in the end obligate bringing an extra seven birds. The next opinion is like Ben Azai, who requires bringing an extra eight);</p>
<p class=secondindent><span class=numl2>2.</span>	Some say, its wool is used for Techeles (for the Me'il. The bells of the Me'il make noise.)</p>
<p class=firstindent><span class=numl1>(b)</span>	R. Shimon ben Akashya says, when Amei ha'Aretz get old, they become befuddled -- "Mesir Safah l'Ne'emanim v'Ta'am Zekenim Yikach";</p>
<p class=secondindent><span class=numl2>1.</span>	When Chachamim get old, they become wiser and more settled -- "bi'Shishim Chochmah v'Orech Yamim Tevunah." (This parallels the ram. Its voice at the end is greater than at the beginning.)</p>
