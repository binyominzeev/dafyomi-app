<p class="bas indent1"><span class="nm">(a)</span><span class="cl">(Gemara) Question:</span> We understand regarding (ashes of) the outer Mizbe'ach [that the Torah fixed a place for them]. We learn from "v'Samo";</p>
<p class="bas indent2"><span class="nm">1.</span>However, what is the source regarding the inner Mizbe'ach?</p>
<p class="bas indent1"><span class="nm">(b)</span><span class="cl">Answer (R. Elazar):</span> "V'Hesir Es Mur'aso b'Notzasah... (El Mekom ha'Dashen)" is not needed to teach about the (ashes of the) outer Mizbe'ach, so we use it to teach about (those of) the inner Mizbe'ach.</p>
<p class="bas indent1"><span class="nm">(c)</span><span class="cl">Question:</span> Perhaps the verse teaches that the crop of Olas ha'Of is thrown to the place where Terumas ha'Deshen is deposited (Rashi; Tosfos - perhaps it teaches only that Terumas ha'Deshen is to the east of the Mizbe'ach)!</p>
<p class="bas indent1"><span class="nm">(d)</span><span class="cl">Answer:</span> If so, it would have sufficed to say "Etzel ha'Mizbe'ach (Kedmah)." "(El Mekom) ha'Dashen" is extra to teach about the inner Mizbe'ach.</p>
<p class="bas indent1"><span class="nm">(e)</span><span class="cl">Question:</span> What is the source regarding the Menorah?</p>
<p class="bas indent1"><span class="nm">(f)</span><span class="cl">Version #1 (Rashi) Answer:</span> It could have said "Deshen". Rather, it says "<i>ha</i>'Dashen". The extra "Hei" teaches about the Menorah.</p>
<p class="bas indent1"><span class="nm">(g)</span><span class="cl">Version #2 (Tosfos):</span> We learn from a Gezeirah Shavah "Deshen-ha'Dashen." (It does not say "Deshen" regarding the Menorah. However, it says "b'Heitivo Es ha'Neros." We can learn a Gezeirah Shavah between similar concepts even if the words are different.)</p>
<p class="bas subject"><span class="nm">2)</span>WHERE DID THE <i>KEDUSHAH</i> GO?</p>
<p class="bas indent1"><span class="nm">(a)</span><span class="cl">(Mishnah - R. Shimon):</span> Me'ilah applies to Torim that are too young;</p>
<p class="bas indent1"><span class="nm">(b)</span>One may not benefit from doves that are too old. Me'ilah does not apply to them.</p>
<p class="bas indent1"><span class="nm">(c)</span><span class="cl">(Gemara) Question:</span> We understand R. Shimon's reason, like he taught elsewhere;</p>
<p class="bas indent2"><span class="nm">1.</span><span class="cl">(Mishnah - R. Shimon):</span> (If one slaughters outside the Mikdash <i>Mechusar Zeman</i>, i.e.) any Korban valid to be offered later, he transgresses a Lav. (This shows that Mechusar Zeman has Kedushah.) There is no Kares;</p>
<p class="bas indent2"><span class="nm">2.</span>Chachamim agree that Me'ilah applies to Mechusar Zeman. Why do they exempt young Torim? ("Chachamim" are the Tana of the Seifa of the previous Mishnah (11b), which is the Reisha of our Mishnah.)</p>
<p class="bas indent1"><span class="nm">(d)</span><span class="cl">Answer:</span> Since a (Behemah) Ba'al Mum can be redeemed, it has Kedushah. Likewise, Mechusar Zeman has Kedushah, and Me'ilah applies to it;</p>
<p class="bas indent2"><span class="nm">1.</span>(Minor) Mumim do not disqualify birds, and they cannot be redeemed, so Me'ilah does not apply to Mechusar Zeman of birds.</p>
<p class="bas indent1"><span class="nm">(e)</span><span class="cl">(Ula):</span> If Kodshim died (without Shechitah), Me'ilah no longer applies to them mid'Oraisa.</p>
<p class="bas indent1"><span class="nm">(f)</span><span class="cl">Question (Rav Chisda):</span> To where did their Kedushah vanish?!</p>
<p class="bas indent2"><span class="nm">1.</span><span class="cl">Counter-question (Ula):</span> How do you understand our Mishnah?</p>
<p class="bas indent3"><span class="nm">i.</span><span class="cl">(Mishnah):</span> One may not benefit from Torim that are too young or doves that are too old. Me'ilah does not apply to them (even though it applied to the doves when they were young).</p>
<p class="bas indent1"><span class="nm">(g)</span><span class="cl">Version #1 (our text, Tosfos) Clarification of question (Rav Chisda):</span> I agree that Me'ilah of Kodshim that died is only mid'Rabanan.</p>
<p class="bas indent2"><span class="nm">1.</span>(You say that if (any) Kodshim died, Me'ilah applies mid'Rabanan.) Do we ever find something that never had Me'ilah mid'Oraisa (Kodshim Kalim, when they were alive) that gets Me'ilah mid'Rabanan (after death)?!</p>
<p class="bas indent2"><span class="nm">2.</span><span class="cl">Version #2 - Rashi - (Ula):</span> (The Mishnah shows that Kedushah vanishes. However,) I agree that when Me'ilah goes away mid'Oraisa, there is Me'ilah mid'Rabanan.</p>
<p class="bas indent1"><span class="nm">(h)</span><span class="cl">Question (Ula, against Rav Chisda):</span> (The Mishnah equates Torim and doves, Me'ilah mid'Rabanan applies to both.) Do we ever find something that never had Me'ilah mid'Oraisa (young Torim were not yet valid for Hakravah) that gets Me'ilah mid'Rabanan (when they are are enough)?!(end of Version #2)</p>
<p class="bas indent1"><span class="nm">(i)</span><span class="cl">Answer:</span> We find this concerning blood!</p>
<p class="bas indent2"><span class="nm">1.</span><span class="cl">(Mishnah):</span> At first Me'ilah does not apply to blood. After it goes to Nachal Kidron, Me'ilah applies to it.</p>
<p class="bas indent1"><span class="nm">(j)</span><span class="cl">Objection:</span> Regarding blood there is Me'ilah from the beginning!</p>
<p class="bas bbbline">12b----------------------------------------12b</p>
<p class="bas indent2"><span class="nm">1.</span><span class="cl">(Rav):</span> If one lets blood from a Kodshim animal, one may not benefit from the blood, and Me'ilah applies to it.</p>
<p class="bas indent1"><span class="nm">(k)</span><span class="cl">Question (against Rav - Rav Hamnuna - Mishnah):</span> One may not benefit from milk or eggs of Kodshim, Me'ilah does not apply to them. (Surely, the same applies to blood. Shitah - this is because menstrual blood turns into milk in a nursing mother!)</p>
<p class="bas indent1"><span class="nm">(l)</span><span class="cl">Answer (Rav Huna):</span> Blood is different, for an animal cannot live without it. It can live without milk.</p>
<p class="bas indent1"><span class="nm">(m)</span><span class="cl">Question (Rav Mesharshiya - Beraisa):</span> One may not benefit from dung (of Kodshim) or (their) Peresh (excrement that was not yet trampled) in a courtyard. Me'ilah does not apply to them. (They are redeemed, and) their money goes to the Lishkah (Rosh, in Pirush Kadmon - i.e. for Bedek ha'Bayis).</p>
<p class="bas indent2"><span class="nm">1.</span>An animal cannot live without Peresh!</p>
<p class="bas indent1"><span class="nm">(n)</span><span class="cl">Answer:</span> Peresh comes from the food it eats. It will eat more and make more Peresh;</p>
<p class="bas indent2"><span class="nm">1.</span>Blood was part of its initial creation.</p>
<p class="bas indent1"><span class="nm">(o)</span><span class="cl">(Beraisa):</span> One may not benefit (from dung or Peresh). Me'ilah does not apply. Their money goes to the Lishkah.</p>
<p class="bas indent1"><span class="nm">(p)</span>This supports R. Elazar;</p>
<p class="bas indent2"><span class="nm">1.</span><span class="cl">(R. Elazar):</span> Whenever Chachamim said that something is Kadosh and not Kadosh (one may not benefit from it, but Me'ilah does not apply), its money goes to the Lishkah.</p>
<p class="bas subject"><span class="nm">3)</span>MILK AND EGGS OF <i>KODSHIM</i></p>
<p class="bas indent1"><span class="nm">(a)</span><span class="cl">(Mishnah):</span> One may not benefit from milk or eggs of Kodshim. Me'ilah does not apply to them;</p>
<p class="bas indent2"><span class="nm">1.</span>This applies only to Kodshei Mizbe'ach. If one was Makdish a hen, Me'ilah applies to it and its egg. If one was Makdish a donkey, Me'ilah applies to it and its milk.</p>
<p class="bas indent1"><span class="nm">(b)</span><span class="cl">(Gemara) Question:</span> (The Mishnah finds Me'ilah in the milk and eggs only regarding Bedek ha'Bayis.) If one was Makdish Kedushas Damim for the Mizbe'ach, there should also be Me'ilah!</p>
<p class="bas indent1"><span class="nm">(c)</span><span class="cl">Answer (Rav Papa):</span> The Mishnah is abbreviated. It means as follows:</p>
<p class="bas indent2"><span class="nm">1.</span>This applies only to Kedushas ha'Guf for the Mizbe'ach. If one was Makdish Kedushas Damim for the Mizbe'ach, it is as if he made Hekdesh Bedek ha'Bayis. If one was Makdish a hen and donkey, Me'ilah applies to them and their eggs and milk.</p>
