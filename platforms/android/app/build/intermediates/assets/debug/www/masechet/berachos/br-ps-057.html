<p class="bas indent1"><span class="nm">(b)</span>If one sees [the name] "Huna" (with one "Nun," which stands for "Nes"), a miracle will be done for him; if one sees "Chanina," "Chinena" or "Yochanan" (with multiple "Nunim"), many miracles will be done.</p>

<p class="bas indent1"><span class="nm">(e)</span><span class="cl">Objection (Rav Sheshes):</span> All the more so, if he killed it, his income will be doubled!</p>

<p class="bas indent1"><span class="nm">(c)</span>Three things are similar to Olam ha'Ba -- Shabbos, the sun, and "Tashmish."</p>
<p class="bas indent1"><span class="nm">(d)</span><span class="cl">Question:</span> To which Tashmish does this refer?</p>
<p class="bas indent2"><span class="nm">1.</span>It does not refer to Tashmish ha'Mitah (marital relations), for that weakens a person!</p>

<p class="bas indent1"><span class="nm">(k)</span>Ten things cause illness to return severely -- eating ox meat, fatty meat, roasted meat, fowl, or a roasted egg; shaving, eating cress, milk, or cheese; going to the bathhouse;</p>
<p class="bas indent2"><span class="nm">1.</span>Some add eating nuts; some add eating gourds.</p>
<p class="bas indent2"><span class="nm">2.</span><span class="cl">(Tana d'Vei R. Yishmael):</span> Gourds are called "Kishu'im" because they are Kasheh (harsh) for the body like swords.</p>

<p class="bas indent2"><span class="nm">2.</span><span class="cl">(Rav Papa):</span> This refers to taking out shoes and sandals (it symbolizes expelling people from the house).</p>

<p class="bas indent1"><span class="nm">(o)</span>Anything that the corpse brought into the house is a good sign, except for dirt (a sign of burial) and mustard.</p>

<p class="bas indent1"><span class="nm">(a)</span><span class="cl">(Mishnah):</span> If one sees a place from which idolatry was uprooted...</p>

<p class="bas indent2"><span class="nm">1.</span>In Chutz la'Aretz, he need not request to return idolaters to serve Hash-m, for most of the residents are Nochrim.</p>
<p class="bas indent2"><span class="nm">2.</span>R. Shimon ben Elazar says, even in Chutz la'Aretz he must say it, for they will ultimately convert -- "Az Ehpoch El Amim Safah Berurah."</p>
<p class="bas indent1"><span class="nm">(d)</span><span class="cl">(Rav Hamnuna):</span> One who sees the evil Bavel must make five blessings:</p>
<p class="bas indent2"><span class="nm">1.</span>On seeing Bavel he says, "Blessed is He who destroyed the evil Bavel";</p>
<p class="bas indent2"><span class="nm">2.</span>On seeing Nebuchadnetzar's house he says, "Blessed is He who destroyed the house of the evil Nebuchadnetzar";</p>
<p class="bas indent2"><span class="nm">3.</span>On seeing the lion's den [from which Daniel was saved] or the furnace [from which Chananyah, Misha'el and Azaryah were saved] he says, "Blessed is He who did miracles for our ancestors in this place";</p>
<p class="bas indent2"><span class="nm">4.</span>On seeing Markulis he says, "Blessed is He gave such forbearance to those who transgress His will";</p>
<p class="bas indent2"><span class="nm">5.</span>On seeing the place where no animal can leave without some of the dirt (to fulfill the curse that Bavel will be desolate), he says, "Blessed is He who says and does, decrees and fulfills."</p>
<p class="bas indent1"><span class="nm">(e)</span>When Rava (who lived in Bavel) would see donkey-drivers taking dirt, he would slap them on the back and say, "Run to do the will of your Master!"</p>
<p class="bas indent1"><span class="nm">(f)</span>When Mar brei d'Ravina would come to Bavel, he would take some of the dirt in his turban and cast it outside (of Bavel) to fulfill, "v'Teiteisiha b'Mat'atei Hashmed."</p>
<p class="bas indent1"><span class="nm">(g)</span><span class="cl">(Rav Ashi):</span> Even before I heard Rav Hamnuna's teaching, I reasoned that those five blessings should be said and I would say them.</p>
