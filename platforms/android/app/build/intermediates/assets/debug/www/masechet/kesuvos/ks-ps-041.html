<p class="dedicationbox"><br>12th CYCLE DEDICATION<br>KESUVOS 41 (30 Tishrei) - dedicated by Reb Mordechai Rabin (London/Yerushalayim) l'Iluy Nishmas his father, ha'Gaon Rav Gedalya Rabinowitz of Manchester, England (and in his later years, Bnei Brak, Israel). Hearing a Shiur of his was an unforgettable experience as his many Talmidim, both Bnei Yeshiva and Ba'alei Batim, can attest. </p>

<p class="bas subject"><span class="nm">1)</span>ONE WHO ADMITS TO SEDUCING</p>
<p class="bas indent1"><span class="nm">(a)</span><span class="cl">(Mishnah):</span> If a man says 'I seduced Ploni's daughter', he pays for embarrassment and blemish due to his own admission, but not the fine;</p>
<p class="bas indent1"><span class="nm">(b)</span>If one says 'I stole an animal' he pays the principal, but not double or (if he sold or slaughtered it) four or five times its value;</p>
<p class="bas indent1"><span class="nm">(c)</span>If one says that his ox gored Ploni, or Ploni's ox, he pays due to his admission;</p>
<p class="bas indent1"><span class="nm">(d)</span>If he says that it gored Ploni's slave, he does not pay due to his admission;</p>
<p class="bas indent1"><span class="nm">(e)</span>The rule is, anyone who pays more than he damaged does not pay due to his admission.</p>
<p class="bas indent1"><span class="nm">(f)</span><span class="cl">(Gemara) - Question:</span> Why didn't the Mishnah teach about a man who admits to raping a girl?</p>
<p class="bas indent1"><span class="nm">(g)</span><span class="cl">Answer:</span> The case of seducing teaches more:</p>
<p class="bas indent2"><span class="nm">1.</span>One who says that he raped her does not discredit her. One might have thought that when he says that he seduced her, and discredits her, he does not pay due to his admission (lest people believe him). The Mishnah teaches that this is not so.</p>
<p class="bas indent1"><span class="nm">(h)</span>Our Mishnah is unlike the following Tana:</p>
<p class="bas indent2"><span class="nm">1.</span><span class="cl">(Beraisa - R. Shimon bar Yehudah):</span> A seducer does not pay embarrassment and blemish due to his own admission. We do not allow him to discredit the girl.</p>
<p class="bas indent1"><span class="nm">(i)</span><span class="cl">Question (Rav Papa):</span> (According to R. Shimon) if she wants him to pay, what is the law?</p>
<p class="bas indent1"><span class="nm">(j)</span><span class="cl">Answer (Abaye):</span> Perhaps the father disapproves (so he does not).</p>
<p class="bas indent1"><span class="nm">(k)</span><span class="cl">Question (Rav Papa):</span> If the father approves, what is the law?</p>
<p class="bas indent1"><span class="nm">(l)</span><span class="cl">Answer (Abaye):</span> Perhaps the family disapproves.</p>
<p class="bas indent1"><span class="nm">(m)</span><span class="cl">Question (Rav Papa):</span> What if the family approves?</p>
<p class="bas indent1"><span class="nm">(n)</span><span class="cl">Answer (Abaye):</span> Certainly, there is someone in the family overseas that would disapprove.</p>
<p class="bas subject"><span class="nm">2)</span>IS HALF-DAMAGE FOR GORING A FINE?</p>
<p class="bas indent1"><span class="nm">(a)</span><span class="cl">(Rav Papa):</span> Half damage is considered like Mamon (not a fine), since animals are prone to do damage unless guarded;</p>
<p class="bas indent2"><span class="nm">1.</span>One should pay full damage for failure to guard his animal. The Torah had mercy on him and makes him pay only half, since the animal was not yet established to gore.</p>
<p class="bas indent1"><span class="nm">(b)</span><span class="cl">(Rav Huna brei d'Rav Yehoshua):</span> Half damage is considered a fine, since animals, even unguarded, are not prone to do damage;</p>
<p class="bas indent2"><span class="nm">1.</span>One should not pay at all. The Torah levies a fine of half-damage to encourage people to guard their animals.</p>
<p class="bas indent1"><span class="nm">(c)</span><span class="cl">(Mishnah (Bava Kama 14b)):</span> Both the victim and the damager pay.</p>
<p class="bas indent1"><span class="nm">(d)</span><span class="cl">Question:</span> We understand this according to the opinion that half-damage is Mamon (the victim should receive full payment, but gets only half);</p>
<p class="bas indent2"><span class="nm">1.</span>According to the opinion that half-damage is a fine, the victim receives what he does not deserve. Can we say that he pays?!</p>
<p class="bas indent1"><span class="nm">(e)</span><span class="cl">Answer:</span> He suffers the decrease in the value of the carcass (after the damage).</p>
<p class="bas indent1"><span class="nm">(f)</span><span class="cl">Question:</span> This was already taught in another Mishnah (9b)!</p>
<p class="bas indent2"><span class="nm">1.</span><span class="cl">(Beraisa):</span> This Mishnah says 'TaSHLuMei (completions of) Nezek' to teach that the victim deals with the carcass (he sells it; payment for damage is based on the amount one must add to the carcass' value at the time of damage to reach the initial value. If the carcass later goes down in value, the victim suffers the loss.)</p>
<p class="bas indent1"><span class="nm">(g)</span><span class="cl">Answer:</span> One Mishnah teaches that this applies to a Tam (an animal that has no Chazakah to gore). The other Mishnah teaches that this applies to a Mu'ad. Both must be taught:</p>
<p class="bas indent2"><span class="nm">1.</span>Had it taught only regarding a Tam, we would say that the Torah was lenient on the damager because his animal was not established to gore;</p>
<p class="bas indent2"><span class="nm">2.</span>Had it taught only regarding a Mu'ad, we would say that the Torah was lenient on the damager because he pays full damage.</p>
<p class="bas indent1"><span class="nm">(h)</span><span class="cl">(Beraisa):</span> The differences between a Tam and Mu'ad are that a Tam pays half-damage from the damaging animal, and a Mu'ad pays full damage, even above the value of the damager.</p>
<p class="bas indent2"><span class="nm">1.</span>It does not say that a Mu'ad pays based on the owner's admission, but a Tam does not (i.e. even a Tam pays, for half-damage is Mamon)!</p>
<p class="bas indent1"><span class="nm">(i)</span><span class="cl">Rejection:</span> A Tam does not pay. The Tana did not list all differences.</p>
<p class="bas indent1"><span class="nm">(j)</span><span class="cl">Question:</span> What else did he omit (he would not omit just one thing)!</p>
<p class="bas indent1"><span class="nm">(k)</span><span class="cl">Answer:</span> He also omitted Kofer (a Tam does not pay even half-ransom for killing a Yisrael).</p>
<p class="bas indent2"><span class="nm">1.</span>(Rav Huna can say that) this is not an omission. The Tana is R. Yosi ha'Glili, who says that a Tam pays half-ransom!</p>
<p class="bas bbbline">41b----------------------------------------41b</p>
<p class="bas indent1"><span class="nm">(l)</span><span class="cl">(Mishnah):</span> If he says that his ox gored Ploni or Ploni's ox, he pays due to his own admission.</p>
<p class="bas indent2"><span class="nm">1.</span><span class="cl">Suggestion:</span> The Mishnah discusses a Tam. (This shows that half-damage is Mamon!)</p>
<p class="bas indent1"><span class="nm">(m)</span><span class="cl">Rejection:</span> No, it discusses a Mu'ad.</p>
<p class="bas indent1"><span class="nm">(n)</span><span class="cl">Question:</span> If you hold that a Tam does not pay due to his admission, why does the Seifa say that if it gored a slave, he does not pay due to his admission? It should distinguish within the case of goring a Yisrael or an animal, and teach that a Tam does not pay due to his admission!</p>
<p class="bas indent1"><span class="nm">(o)</span><span class="cl">Answer:</span> The Tana teaches only laws of a Mu'ad.</p>
<p class="bas subject"><span class="nm">3)</span>HALF-DAMAGE IS A FINE</p>
<p class="bas indent1"><span class="nm">(a)</span><span class="cl">(Mishnah):</span> The rule is, all who pay more than they damaged do not pay on their own admission.</p>
<p class="bas indent1"><span class="nm">(b)</span><span class="cl">Inference:</span> One who pays less than he damaged does pay due to his admission!</p>
<p class="bas indent1"><span class="nm">(c)</span><span class="cl">Rejection:</span> No, one who pays <i>like</i> he damaged pays due to his admission.</p>
<p class="bas indent1"><span class="nm">(d)</span><span class="cl">Question:</span> If one who pays less than he damaged does not pay due to his own admission, it should say that one who does not pay <i>like</i> he damaged does not pay due to his own admission. This includes one who pays more and one who pays less!</p>
<p class="bas indent1"><span class="nm">(e)</span>This refutes the opinion that half-damage is a fine. The Halachah is, it is a fine.</p>
<p class="bas indent1"><span class="nm">(f)</span><span class="cl">Question:</span> How can the Halachah follow an opinion that was refuted?</p>
<p class="bas indent1"><span class="nm">(g)</span><span class="cl">Answer:</span> It was refuted because the Mishnah did not say 'One who does not pay <i>like</i> he damaged...' (but this is not a refutation);</p>
<p class="bas indent2"><span class="nm">1.</span>We could not teach this, for it is not always true! A tradition from Sinai teaches that half-damage of pebbles (if an animal set an object in motion, and the object damaged) is Mamon.</p>
<p class="bas indent1"><span class="nm">(h)</span>Since the Halachah is that half-damage is a fine, if a dog killed and ate sheep, or a cat ate large chickens, this is unusual (any unusual damage pays half, like goring), so we do not force one to pay for it in Bavel (we do not collect fines in Chutz la'Aretz).</p>
<p class="bas indent2"><span class="nm">1.</span>Cats normally eat small chickens, and in Bavel we make one pay for this.</p>
<p class="bas indent1"><span class="nm">(i)</span>If the victim seized compensation for the damage, we do not take it from him. If he wants to take the damager to trial in Eretz Yisrael, we force the damager to agree to a time.</p>
<p class="bas indent2"><span class="nm">1.</span>If the damager does not go, we excommunicate him.</p>
<p class="bas indent1"><span class="nm">(j)</span>In any case, we excommunicate him if he keeps the damaging animal around;</p>
<p class="bas indent2"><span class="nm">1.</span><span class="cl">(Beraisa - R. Nasan):</span> A person should not raise an evil dog or stand up a rickety ladder in his house - "Do not put blood in your house".</p>
<p class="perekline">PEREK NA'ARAH</p>
<p class="bas subject"><span class="nm">4)</span>WHO RECEIVES THE PAYMENTS?</p>
<p class="bas indent1"><span class="nm">(a)</span><span class="cl">(Mishnah):</span> If a Na'arah was seduced, the payments for her embarrassment and blemish and her fine go to her father. The same applies to the payment for pain if she was raped;</p>
<p class="bas indent1"><span class="nm">(b)</span>If the trial was before the father died, the payments belong to the father. If he died afterwards, his sons inherit them;</p>
<p class="bas indent1"><span class="nm">(c)</span>If the father died before the trial, she receives the payments;</p>
<p class="bas indent1"><span class="nm">(d)</span>If the trial was before she became a Bogeres, the payments belong to the father. If he died afterwards, his sons inherit them;</p>
<p class="bas indent1"><span class="nm">(e)</span>If she became a Bogeres before the trial, she receives the payments;</p>
<p class="bas indent1"><span class="nm">(f)</span>R. Shimon says, if she did not collect before the father died, she receives the payments.</p>
<p class="bas indent1"><span class="nm">(g)</span>(Her father receives) her earnings and Metzi'os (Hefker objects that she finds), even if she did not collect them yet. If her father dies, they belong to the brothers.</p>
