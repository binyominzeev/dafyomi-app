<p class="bas subject"><span class="nm">1)</span>THE <i>ROSH HASHANAH </i>FOR MONTHS</p>
<p class="bas indent1"><span class="nm">(a)</span>(Beraisa) The first of Nisan is the new year for the following:</p>
<p class="bas indent2"><span class="nm">1.</span>Counting months;</p>
<p class="bas indent2"><span class="nm">2.</span>Calculating leap years;</p>
<p class="bas indent2"><span class="nm">3.</span>Dating the new Terumas Shekalim (bringing Korbanos from the new contributions);</p>
<p class="bas indent2"><span class="nm">4.</span><span class="cl">Some add:</span> Defining terms for renting houses.</p>
<p class="bas indent1"><span class="nm">(b)</span><span class="cl">Question:</span> What is the source of the first of Nisan as the Rosh Hashanah for months?</p>
<p class="bas indent1"><span class="nm">(c)</span><span class="cl">Answer #1:</span> One verse states that Pesach is in "the first of the months of the year" (Shemos 12,2) and another verse states that Pesach is in the month of Aviv, when the new crops ripen, i.e. Nisan (Devarim 16,1).</p>
<p class="bas indent2"><span class="nm">1.</span><span class="cl">Question:</span> Perhaps it is Iyar (in which the crops also ripen)?</p>
<p class="bas indent2"><span class="nm">2.</span><span class="cl">Answer:</span> Aviv refers to the first ripening of crops, not to those that ripen late.</p>
<p class="bas indent2"><span class="nm">3.</span><span class="cl">Question:</span> Perhaps it is Adar (in which there is new ripening of crops)?</p>
<p class="bas indent2"><span class="nm">4.</span><span class="cl">Answer:</span> It must be that the majority of the crop is newly ripening.</p>
<p class="bas indent2"><span class="nm">5.</span><span class="cl">Question:</span> It does not state in the Torah that the majority of the crop must be newly ripening!</p>
<p class="bas indent1"><span class="nm">(d)</span><span class="cl">Answer #2 (R. Chisda):</span> The Torah states that the seventh month is the one in which the produce is gathered in. Since that refers to Tishrei, the first month must be Nisan.</p>
<p class="bas indent2"><span class="nm">1.</span><span class="cl">Question:</span> Perhaps it refers to Cheshvan, making Iyar the first month?</p>
<p class="bas indent2"><span class="nm">2.</span><span class="cl">Answer:</span> The ingathering does not occur in Cheshvan.</p>
<p class="bas indent2"><span class="nm">3.</span><span class="cl">Question:</span> Perhaps it refers to Elul, making Adar the first month?</p>
<p class="bas indent2"><span class="nm">4.</span><span class="cl">Answer:</span> It must be the month in which the majority of the ingathering takes place, which is Tishrei.</p>
<p class="bas indent2"><span class="nm">5.</span><span class="cl">Question:</span> It does not state in the Torah that the majority of the ingathering must take place!</p>
<p class="bas indent1"><span class="nm">(e)</span><span class="cl">Answer #3 (Ravina):</span> Nisan as the Rosh Hashanah for months is learned not from the Chumash, but from Nevi'im: "...the eleventh month, Shevat" (Zecharyah 1,7).</p>
<p class="bas indent1"><span class="nm">(f)</span><span class="cl">Answer #4 (Rabah bar Ulah):</span> It is learned from the verse stating that Esther was taken to Achashverosh in the tenth month, Teves (Esther 2,16).</p>
<p class="bas indent1"><span class="nm">(g)</span><span class="cl">Answer #5 (R. Kahana):</span> It is learned from the verse stating that Kisleiv is the ninth month (Zecharyah 7,1).</p>
<p class="bas indent1"><span class="nm">(h)</span><span class="cl">Answer #6 (R. Acha bar Yakov):</span> It is learned from the verse stating that Sivan is the third month (Esther 8,9).</p>
<p class="bas indent1"><span class="nm">(i)</span><span class="cl">Answer #7 (R. Ashi):</span> It is learned from the verse stating that Adar is the twelfth month (Esther 3,7).</p>
<p class="bas indent1"><span class="nm">(j)</span><span class="cl">Answer #8 (R. Ashi):</span> It is learned from the verse stating "the first month, Nisan" (Esther 3,7).</p>
<p class="bas indent2"><span class="nm">1.</span><span class="cl">Question:</span> Why didn't everyone use this source, which directly mentions Nisan?</p>
<p class="bas indent2"><span class="nm">2.</span><span class="cl">Answer:</span> It might mean that Nisan was the first month in the episode of Haman.</p>
<p class="bas indent1"><span class="nm">(k)</span>The Tana of our Mishnah did not list this Rosh Hashanah because he was discussing years, not months.</p>
<p class="bas subject"><span class="nm">2)</span>THE <i>ROSH HASHANAH</i> FOR LEAP YEARS</p>
<p class="bas indent1"><span class="nm">(a)</span><span class="cl">Question:</span> Are decisions to make leap years really made in Nisan? Surely we have learned differently in a Beraisa;</p>
<p class="bas indent2"><span class="nm">1.</span>It is forbidden to investigate before Rosh Hashanah (Tishrei) as to whether to make a leap year (as the decision will be forgotten in the meantime).</p>
<p class="bas indent2"><span class="nm">2.</span>If it was then decided that the year should be a leap year, this decision is invalid.</p>
<p class="bas indent2"><span class="nm">3.</span>In times of need, the decision can be taken immediately after Rosh Hashanah.</p>
<p class="bas indent2"><span class="nm">4.</span>The only month that can be added to is Adar.</p>
<p class="bas indent1"><span class="nm">(b)</span><span class="cl">Answer (R. Nachman bar Yitzchak):</span> The "Rosh Hashanah for leap years" refers to the last date on which one can decide to make a leap year (i.e. as soon as Rosh Chodesh Nisan has been consecrated, it cannot be turned into Adar Sheni):</p>
<p class="bas indent2"><span class="nm">1.</span>(Mishnah) (R. Yehoshua and R. Papayas testify:) During the entire month of Adar, they can decide to make the year a leap year (but not once Rosh Chodesh Nisan has been consecrated).</p>
<p class="bas indent2"><span class="nm">2.</span>(The excluded view of the Chachamim) This decision can only be taken until Purim.</p>
<p class="bas indent3"><span class="nm">i.</span><span class="cl">Question:</span> Why can it only be taken until Purim?</p>
<p class="bas indent3"><span class="nm">ii.</span><span class="cl">Answer:</span> The laws of Pesach are publicly taught thirty days before Pesach; after listening to these lessons, people will not accept that Pesach has been delayed by a month.</p>
<p class="bas indent2"><span class="nm">3.</span><span class="cl">R. Yehoshua and R. Papayas would respond:</span> People understand that the calendar depends upon calculations, and they would reason that the Chachamim had not done the necessary calculations until now.</p>
<p class="bas indent1"><span class="nm">(c)</span>The Tana of our Mishnah did not list this Rosh Hashanah because he is discussing Roshei Shanim that begin processes, not that end them.</p>
<p class="bas subject"><span class="nm">3)</span>THE ROSH HASHANAH FOR TERUMAS SHEKALIM</p>
<p class="bas indent1"><span class="nm">(a)</span><span class="cl">Question:</span> What is the source for the first of Nisan being the new year for Terumas Shekalim?</p>
<p class="bas indent1"><span class="nm">(b)</span><span class="cl">Answer (R. Yeshayah):</span> The Torah states that the new Korbanos should be brought from the Terumos of the new year (Bamidbar 28,14) and we learn (by way of the identical word "year") (Shemos 12,2) that this refers to the new year beginning with Nisan.</p>
<p class="bas indent2"><span class="nm">1.</span><span class="cl">Question:</span> Why not learn that it refers to the new year beginning with Tishrei, where it also has the word "year"?</p>
<p class="bas indent2"><span class="nm">2.</span><span class="cl">Answer:</span> The verse of the Korbanos uses the phrase "months of the year," and the word "months" is only mentioned in conjunction with the Rosh Hashanah of Nisan, not with the Rosh Hashanah of Tishrei.</p>
<p class="bas indent1"><span class="nm">(c)</span>(R. Yehudah, citing Shmuel) Communal Korbanos which are brought on the first of Nisan should be brought from the donations of the new year; if they are brought from last year's donations, they are valid, but a mitzvah is lost.</p>
<p class="bas indent1"><span class="nm">(d)</span>(Another Beraisa) As above. In addition,a communal Korban donated by an individual is valid, provided that he confers it upon the community.</p>
<p class="bas indent2"><span class="nm">1.</span><span class="cl">Question:</span> This is obvious!</p>
<p class="bas indent2"><span class="nm">2.</span><span class="cl">Answer:</span> One might have thought that he is suspected of not conferring it upon the community with a full heart; thus, we need be told that there is no such concern.</p>
<p class="bas bbbline">7b----------------------------------------7b</p>
<p class="bas indent1"><span class="nm">(e)</span>The Tana of our Mishnah did not list this Rosh Hashanah because since the Korbanos are valid if brought from last year's donations, it is not an absolute Rosh Hashanah</p>
<p class="bas subject"><span class="nm">4)</span>THE <i>ROSH HASHANAH </i>FOR TERMS OF HOUSE RENTALS (see 1:a:4)</p>
<p class="bas indent1"><span class="nm">(a)</span>(Beraisa) If one rents out a house for a year, the year is calculated to the same day of the same month.</p>
<p class="bas indent1"><span class="nm">(b)</span>If the rental term was "this year," then even if it was rented as late as the first of Adar, the year is finished on the first of Nisan.</p>
<p class="bas indent1"><span class="nm">(c)</span>Even according to the opinion that one day can count as a year, in this case (where it only finishes in Nisan if it started by the beginning of Adar) it is known that people do not bother to rent out their houses for less than thirty days.</p>
<p class="bas indent1"><span class="nm">(d)</span><span class="cl">Question:</span> Perhaps Tishrei should be the Rosh Hashanah (and a rental by the first of Elul would finish on the first of Tishrei)?</p>
<p class="bas indent1"><span class="nm">(e)</span><span class="cl">Answer:</span> A rental that takes place at that time of year is usually intended for the entire duration of winter.</p>
<p class="bas indent1"><span class="nm">(f)</span>The Tana of our Mishnah, and the Tana Kama of the Beraisa (1:a:4 above), did not list this Rosh Hashanah because it often rains in Nisan, too (therefore, the first of Nisan should not end a rental initiated by the beginning of Adar).</p>
<p class="bas subject"><span class="nm">5)</span>THE ROSH HASHANAH FOR MA'ASER BEHEMAH</p>
<p class="bas indent1"><span class="nm">(a)</span>Question:</p>
<p class="bas indent2"><span class="nm">1.</span>Our Mishna follows R. Meir, as we find in a Mishnah (Bechoros 57b) that he holds that the first of Elul is Rosh Hashanah for Ma'aser Behemah.</p>
<p class="bas indent2"><span class="nm">2.</span>The Mishnah's earlier ruling that the fifteenth of Nisan is the Rosh Hashanah for festivals follows the view of R. Shimon (who required the three festivals to be sequential from Nisan in order for there to be Bal Te'acher).</p>
<p class="bas indent2"><span class="nm">3.</span>If so, the first section and the dissenting view in the second section (that the Rosh Hashanah for Ma'aser Behemah is on the first of Tishrei) are according to R. Shimon, and the first view in the second section is according toR. Meir!</p>
<p class="bas indent1"><span class="nm">(b)</span><span class="cl">Answer (R. Yosef):</span> The Mishnah is all being stated by Rebi; he brought different sections according to different opinions.</p>
<p class="bas indent1"><span class="nm">(c)</span><span class="cl">Question:</span> If so, the Tana of the Mishnah cited both the fifteenth of Nisan as the Rosh Hashanah for festivals, and the first of Elul as the Rosh Hashanah for Ma'aser Behemah, in which case there are five Roshei Shanim, not four!</p>
<p class="bas indent1"><span class="nm">(d)</span><span class="cl">Answer (Rava):</span> It is universally agreed upon that there are four Roshei Shanim-the first of Nisan, the first of Tishrei, the first (or fifteenth) of Shevat, and either the first of Elul (according to R. Meir) or the fifteenth of Nisan (according to R. Shimon).</p>
<p class="bas indent1"><span class="nm">(e)</span><span class="cl">Alternate answer (R. Nachman bar Yitzchak):</span> The Mishnah means that there are four months in which there are Roshei Shanim.(Nisan contains two)</p>
<p class="bas indent1"><span class="nm">(f)</span><span class="cl">Question:</span> Surely there are additional Roshei Shanim:</p>
<p class="bas indent2"><span class="nm">1.</span>(Mishnah) The sixteenth of Nisan is the Rosh Hashanah for the Omer; the sixth of Sivan is the Rosh Hashanah for the two loaves.</p>
<p class="bas indent2"><span class="nm">2.</span>Therefore, according to Rava, our Mishnah should have stated that there are six Roshei Shanim!</p>
<p class="bas indent2"><span class="nm">3.</span>And according to R. Nachman bar Yitzchak (that it refers to the number of months which contain Roshei Shanim) it should have stated that there are five!</p>
<p class="bas indent1"><span class="nm">(g)</span><span class="cl">Answer #1 (R. Papa):</span> The Mishnah only lists those Roshei Shanim which take effect from the previous evening.</p>
<p class="bas indent2"><span class="nm">1.</span><span class="cl">Question:</span> Surely the Rosh Hashanah for Korbanos, which renders him liable for Bal Te'acher, takes effect only by day (as it is only then that the Korban can be brought)!</p>
<p class="bas indent2"><span class="nm">2.</span><span class="cl">Answer:</span> Since he ought to have brought his Korban before the festival began, the sin is counted from when the festival begins at night.</p>
<p class="bas indent2"><span class="nm">3.</span><span class="cl">Question:</span> Surely Yovalos, which only take effect with the blowing of the Shofar, will take effect only by day (as it is only then that the Shofar is blown)!</p>
<p class="bas indent2"><span class="nm">4.</span><span class="cl">Answer:</span> The Mishnah follows R. Yishmael, son of R Yochanan ben Beroka, who holds that Yovel begins with the onset of the first of Tishrei at night.</p>
<p class="bas indent1"><span class="nm">(h)</span><span class="cl">Answer #2 (R. Shisha berei R. Idi):</span> The Mishnah does not list those Roshei Shanim which take effect only by means of an action (such as bringing the Omer and the two loaves).</p>
<p class="bas indent2"><span class="nm">1.</span><span class="cl">Question:</span> Surely the Rosh Hashanah for festivals, which renders him liable for Bal Te'acher, takes effect with the action of bringing the Korban Tamid (as he can't bring his Neder-Korban until that has been brought)!</p>
<p class="bas indent2"><span class="nm">2.</span><span class="cl">Answer:</span> He is liable for Bal Te'acher as soon as the day begins.</p>
<p class="bas indent2"><span class="nm">3.</span><span class="cl">Question:</span> Surely Yovel only takes effect with the action of blowing the Shofar!</p>
<p class="bas indent2"><span class="nm">4.</span><span class="cl">Answer:</span> The Mishnah follows R. Yishmael, son of R Yochanan ben Beroka, who holds that Yovel begins with the onset of the day.</p>
<p class="bas indent1"><span class="nm">(i)</span><span class="cl">Answer #3 (R. Ashi):</span> The Mishnah means that there are four Roshei Shanim which occur on Rosh Chodesh.</p>
<p class="bas indent2"><span class="nm">1.</span><span class="cl">Question:</span> Would the Mishnah have stated this number which is only true according to Beis Shamai (who holds that the Rosh Hashanah for trees is on the first of Shevat)?</p>
<p class="bas indent2"><span class="nm">2.</span><span class="cl">Answer:</span> The Mishnah means that three Roshei Shanim are universally agreed upon to occur on Rosh Chodesh, and the fourth is subject to dispute.</p>
