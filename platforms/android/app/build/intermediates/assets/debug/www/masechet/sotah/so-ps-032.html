<p class="bas subject"><span class="nm">1)</span>INVALID WITNESSES</p>
<p class="bas indent1"><span class="nm">(a)</span><span class="cl">Version #2:</span> If a valid witness came first, even if 100 women later contradict him, they are only like one man (and they are not believed, since the valid witness was believed like two);</p>
<p class="bas indent2"><span class="nm">1.</span>The Mishnah discusses when a woman testified first.</p>
<p class="bas indent2"><span class="nm">2.</span>We explain R. Nechemya's words as follows. Wherever the Torah believed one witness, we follow the majority. Two women who contradict one woman are like two men who contradict a man (they are believed);</p>
<p class="bas indent2"><span class="nm">3.</span>If two women contradict one man, we are in doubt who to believe.</p>
<p class="bas indent1"><span class="nm">(b)</span><span class="cl">Question:</span> Why must the Mishnah teach two clauses about invalid witnesses?</p>
<p class="bas indent1"><span class="nm">(c)</span><span class="cl">Answer:</span> One might have thought that we follow the majority (of invalid witnesses) only to be stringent. The other clause teaches that we follow them even to be lenient.</p>

<p class="bas subject"><span class="nm">2)</span>WHAT MUST BE SAID IN HEBREW</p>
<p class="bas indent1"><span class="nm">(a)</span><span class="cl">(Mishnah):</span> The following may be said in any language: Parshas Sotah; Viduy Ma'aser (the declaration that one has given his tithes); Shema Yisrael; prayer; Birkas ha'Mazon; the oath that one does not know testimony; and the oath of a Shomer (watchman).</p>
<p class="bas indent1"><span class="nm">(b)</span><span class="cl">The following Parshiyos must be said in Hebrew:</span> Mikra Bikurim (what one recites when he brings the first of the seven species to ripen); the verses said at Chalitzah; the Berachos and curses (said on Har Gerizim and Har Eival); Birkas Kohanim; the Berachos of the Kohen Gadol (on Yom Kipur); Hakhel (the Parshah the king reads when the nation gathers on Sukos); Eglah Arufah (beheading a calf when a murdered body is found); and what the Kohen anointed for war says to the soldiers.</p>
<p class="bas indent1"><span class="nm">(c)</span>The following teaches that Mikra Bikurim must be said in Hebrew. It says "you will answer...", and it says (regarding the Berachos and curses) "the Leviyim will answer";</p>
<p class="bas indent2"><span class="nm">1.</span>Just like the Leviyim answered in Hebrew, also Mikra Bikurim.</p>
<p class="bas indent1"><span class="nm">(d)</span>We learn about Chalitzah from "she will answer and say", like it says about the Leviyim;</p>
<p class="bas indent2"><span class="nm">1.</span>R. Yehudah says, we need not learn from the Leviyim. It says "she will answer and say like this" - it must be in the exact language as in the Torah.</p>
<p class="bas subject"><span class="nm">3)</span>THE BLESSINGS AND CURSES</p>
<p class="bas indent1"><span class="nm">(a)</span><span class="cl">(Continuation of Mishnah) Question:</span> What was the procedure of the Berachos and curses?</p>
<p class="bas indent1"><span class="nm">(b)</span><span class="cl">Answer:</span> When Bnei Yisrael entered Eretz Yisrael, they came to Har Gerizim and Har Eival in Shomron, near Shechem.</p>
<p class="bas indent2"><span class="nm">1.</span>Six tribes ascended Har Gerizim, and six ascended Har Eival. The Kohanim, Leviyim, and the Aron were in the valley below.</p>
<p class="bas indent2"><span class="nm">2.</span>The Kohanim surrounded the Aron, the Leviyim surrounded the Kohanim, and the rest of Yisrael were on both sides - "all of Yisrael, the sages, Sheluchim of Beis Din, and judges stand on both sides of the Aron."</p>
<p class="bas indent1"><span class="nm">(c)</span>(The Leviyim) turned towards Har Gerizim and started with a Berachah, 'blessed is the man who will not make an (idolatrous) graven image or figure from molten metal.' Yisre'elim on both sides answered 'Amen';</p>
<p class="bas indent2"><span class="nm">1.</span>They (the Leviyim) turned towards Har Eival for the curse, 'cursed is the man who will make a graven image or figure from molten metal.' Yisre'elim on both sides answered Amen.</p>
<p class="bas indent2"><span class="nm">2.</span>All the Berachos and curses were said like this.</p>
<p class="bas indent1"><span class="nm">(d)</span>Afterwards, they brought the stones, built an Mizbe'ach and plastered it with lime; they wrote the entire Torah on it, in each of the 70 languages - "Ba'er Heitev."</p>
<p class="bas indent1"><span class="nm">(e)</span>They took the stones and stayed overnight in their place (Gilgal).</p>

<p class="bas subject"><span class="nm">4)</span>THINGS SAID IN ANY LANGUAGE</p>
<p class="bas indent1"><span class="nm">(a)</span><span class="cl">(Gemara):</span> "The Kohen tells the woman" teaches that Parshas Sotah may be said in any language.</p>
<p class="bas indent1"><span class="nm">(b)</span><span class="cl">(Beraisa):</span> We inform her why she drinks, in what she drinks, what caused her to be defiled, and for which adultery the water tests her.</p>
<p class="bas indent2"><span class="nm">1.</span>Why she drinks - because there was warning and seclusion;</p>
<p class="bas indent2"><span class="nm">2.</span>In what she drinks - in a Kli of earthenware;</p>
<p class="bas indent2"><span class="nm">3.</span>What caused her to be defiled - lightheadedness and immaturity;</p>
<p class="bas indent2"><span class="nm">4.</span>For which adultery the water tests her - (not if she was) unaware or forced, (only if she sinned) knowingly and willingly.</p>
<p class="bas indent1"><span class="nm">(c)</span><span class="cl">(Mishnah):</span> Viduy Ma'aser (may be said in any language).</p>
<p class="bas indent2"><span class="nm">1.</span>It says "you will say in front of Hash-m, 'I eradicated the Kodesh (the tithes) from the house.'" We learn from Parshas Sotah, in which it also says "saying", and may be said in any language.</p>
<p class="bas indent1"><span class="nm">(d)</span><span class="cl">Question (Rav Zevid):</span> Why don't we learn from the (Berachos and curses of the) Leviyim, in which it also says "saying"? They were in Hebrew!</p>
<p class="bas indent1"><span class="nm">(e)</span><span class="cl">Answer (Abaye):</span> It is better to learn from Sotah, in which it says only "saying" (like in Viduy Ma'aser), and not from the Leviyim, in which it says "answering" and "saying."</p>
<p class="bas indent1"><span class="nm">(f)</span><span class="cl">(Beraisa - R. Shimon):</span> One should mention his own praise in a low voice. We learn from Viduy Ma'aser;</p>
<p class="bas indent2"><span class="nm">1.</span>One should mention his detriment in a loud voice. We learn from Mikra Bikurim.</p>
<p class="bas indent1"><span class="nm">(g)</span><span class="cl">Question:</span> Here, R. Shimon says that detriment should be in a loud voice;</p>
<p class="bas indent2"><span class="nm">1.</span><span class="cl">Contradiction (R. Yochanan, citing R. Shimon):</span> Prayer was instituted to be said quietly, to avoid embarrassing sinners, just like the Torah says to slaughter a Chatas (for a sin) in the same place (the north) as a (voluntary) Olah (so people will not know that he brings a Chatas).</p>
<p class="bas indent1"><span class="nm">(h)</span><span class="cl">Answer:</span> Rather, one should discuss his affliction in a loud voice.</p>
<p class="bas indent2"><span class="nm">1.</span><span class="cl">(Beraisa):</span> "He (a Metzora) will call out 'Tamei, Tamei'" - one should publicize his affliction, so others will ask Hash-m to have mercy upon him.</p>
<p class="bas indent2"><span class="nm">2.</span>The same applies to one who lost a relative.</p>
<p class="bas indent1"><span class="nm">(i)</span><span class="cl">(R. Yochanan, citing R. Shimon):</span> Prayer was instituted to be said quietly, to avoid embarrassing sinners, just like the Torah says to slaughter a Chatas in the same place as an Olah.</p>
<p class="bas indent1"><span class="nm">(j)</span><span class="cl">Objection #1:</span> The blood of a Chatas is put on top of the Mizbe'ach, and the blood of an Olah is thrown below (on corners of the Mizbe'ach. People will know that it is a Chatas!)</p>
<p class="bas indent1"><span class="nm">(k)</span><span class="cl">Answer:</span> Only the Kohen will know.</p>
<p class="bas indent1"><span class="nm">(l)</span><span class="cl">Objection #2:</span> A Chatas is a female, but an Olah is a male!</p>
<p class="bas indent1"><span class="nm">(m)</span><span class="cl">Answer:</span> A lamb's tail covers the genitals, so onlookers cannot tell its gender.</p>
<p class="bas indent2"><span class="nm">1.</span><span class="cl">Question:</span> If the sinner brings a goat, onlookers will know that it is a female!</p>
<p class="bas indent2"><span class="nm">2.</span><span class="cl">Answer:</span> He embarrassed himself. If he did not want people to know, he should have brought a lamb! (One may bring a female lamb or goat for a Chatas.)</p>
<p class="bas indent2"><span class="nm">3.</span><span class="cl">Question:</span> One who served idolatry must bring a goat!</p>
<p class="bas indent2"><span class="nm">4.</span><span class="cl">Answer:</span> For such a severe sin, it is good that he be embarrassed, to help atone for the sin.</p>
<p class="bas subject"><span class="nm">5)</span>MUST <i>SHEMA </i>BE RECITED IN HEBREW?</p>
<p class="bas indent1"><span class="nm">(a)</span><span class="cl">(Mishnah):</span> Shema Yisrael (may be recited in any language).</p>
<p class="bas indent2"><span class="nm">1.</span>"Shema (hear)" - it may be in any language you hear (i.e. understand).</p>
<p class="bas indent1"><span class="nm">(b)</span><span class="cl">(Beraisa - Rebbi):</span> Shema Yisrael must be said as it is written (i.e. in Hebrew);</p>
<p class="bas indent1"><span class="nm">(c)</span>Chachamim say, it may be in any language.</p>
<p class="bas indent2"><span class="nm">1.</span>Rebbi learns from "they (the words) will be" - like they are (in Hebrew).</p>
<p class="bas indent2"><span class="nm">2.</span>Chachamim learn from "Shema (hear)" - in any language you hear.</p>
<p class="bas indent1"><span class="nm">(d)</span><span class="cl">Question:</span> What do Chachamim learn from "they will be"?</p>
<p class="bas indent1"><span class="nm">(e)</span><span class="cl">Answer:</span> This teaches that it must be read in order.</p>
<p class="bas indent2"><span class="nm">1.</span>Rebbi learns this from the extra 'Hei' in "ha'Devarim (the words)."</p>
<p class="bas indent2"><span class="nm">2.</span>Chachamim do not expound the Hei.</p>
<p class="bas indent1"><span class="nm">(f)</span><span class="cl">Question:</span> What does Rebbi learn from "Shema"?</p>
<p class="bas indent1"><span class="nm">(g)</span><span class="cl">Answer:</span> This teaches that one must say the words audibly to his own ears.</p>
<p class="bas indent2"><span class="nm">1.</span>Chachamim hold that even if one does not say it audibly, he fulfills the Mitzvah.</p>
