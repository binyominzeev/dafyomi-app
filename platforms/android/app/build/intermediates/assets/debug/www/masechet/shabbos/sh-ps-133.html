<p class="bas indent1"><span class="nm">(a)</span>Tana'im argue like Rava and Rav Safra:</p>
<p class="bas indent2"><span class="nm">1.</span><span class="cl">(Beraisa - R. Yoshiyah):</span> "Besar" - even if there is Tzara'as there, "Yimol";</p>
<p class="bas indent2"><span class="nm">2.</span>R. Yonason says, we do not need the verse [to teach about Milah in its time] - since it overrides Shabbos, all the more so it overrides Tzara'as!</p>
<p class="bas indent1"><span class="nm">(b)</span><span class="cl">Version #1 (Beraisa - R. Yoshiyah):</span> "Besar" - even if there is Tzara'as there, "Yimol".</p>
<p class="bas indent1"><span class="nm">(c)</span><span class="cl">Question:</span> Why do we need a verse - he does not intend to cut the Tzara'as (just to circumcise), Davar she'Eino Miskaven is permitted!</p>
<p class="bas indent1"><span class="nm">(d)</span><span class="cl">Answer #1 (Abaye):</span> He holds like R. Yehudah, who forbids Davar she'Eino Miskaven.</p>
<p class="bas indent1"><span class="nm">(e)</span><span class="cl">Answer #2 (Rava):</span> The verse is needed even according to R. Shimon - R. Shimon agrees regarding a Pesik Reisha (it is as if he intends).</p>
<p class="bas indent1"><span class="nm">(f)</span><span class="cl">Question:</span> Abaye agrees with this! (Why did he say that it is only like R. Yehudah?)</p>
<p class="bas indent2"><span class="nm">1.</span><span class="cl">(Abaye and Rava):</span> R. Shimon agrees regarding a Pesik Reisha.</p>
<p class="bas indent1"><span class="nm">(g)</span><span class="cl">Answer:</span> After he heard this from Rava, he agreed with it.</p>
<p class="bas indent1"><span class="nm">(h)</span><span class="cl">Version #2 (Beraisa):</span> "Hishamer b'Nega ha'Tzara'as Lishmor Me'od v'La'asos" - La'asos (to overtly cut) is forbidden, but one may work with a date shoot wrapped around his foot or carrying a load on a pole on his shoulder (as long as he does not intend to cut) - if the Tzara'as comes off, he is Tahor.</p>
<p class="bas indent1"><span class="nm">(i)</span><span class="cl">Question:</span> Why do we need a verse - Davar she'Eino Miskaven is permitted!</p>
<p class="bas indent1"><span class="nm">(j)</span><span class="cl">Answer #1 (Abaye):</span> He holds like R. Yehudah, who [elsewhere] forbids Davar she'Eino Miskaven.</p>
<p class="bas indent1"><span class="nm">(k)</span><span class="cl">Answer #2 (Rava):</span> The verse is needed even according to R. Shimon - R. Shimon agrees regarding a Pesik Reisha.</p>
<p class="bas indent1"><span class="nm">(l)</span><span class="cl">Question:</span> Abaye agrees with this!</p>
<p class="bas indent2"><span class="nm">1.</span><span class="cl">(Abaye and Rava):</span> R. Shimon agrees regarding a Pesik Reisha.</p>
<p class="bas indent1"><span class="nm">(m)</span><span class="cl">Answer:</span> After he heard this from Rava, he agreed with it. (end of Version #2)</p>
<p class="bas indent1"><span class="nm">(n)</span><span class="cl">Question:</span> According to Abaye [before he retracted], what does R. Shimon learn from "Besar"?</p>
<p class="bas indent1"><span class="nm">(o)</span><span class="cl">Answer (Rav Amram):</span> This permits one who intends to cut his Tzara'as.</p>
<p class="bas indent1"><span class="nm">(p)</span><span class="cl">Question:</span> This applies to "Besar" written regarding an adult - how can we answer for "Besar" written regarding an eight-day old?</p>
<p class="bas indent1"><span class="nm">(q)</span><span class="cl">Answer (Rav Mesharshiya):</span> This permits a father who intends to cut his son's Tzara'as.</p>
<p class="bas indent1"><span class="nm">(r)</span><span class="cl">Question:</span> If someone else [who is not concerned about the Tzara'as] can circumcise, the father should not be allowed! (The Rosh (Chulin 6:8) holds that Milah is primarily incumbent on the father, he cannot make a Shali'ach for this. Our Gemara seems to say someone else can do the Mitzvah! Shach (C.M. 372) - anyone can do the primary Mitzvah - there is an additional Mitzvah for the father himself to circumcise, to which Shlichus does not apply. The primary Mitzvah overrides the Lav and Ase of Tzara'as, the additional Mitzvah does not. Beis ha'Levi (1:10) - if one does not want to circumcise his son, everyone has a Mitzvah to circumcise him, therefore Shlichus does not apply, just like it does not apply to Milah of converts (Ramban).)</p>
<p class="bas indent2"><span class="nm">1.</span><span class="cl">(Reish Lakish):</span> If one can fulfill an Ase without transgressing a Lav, he must; if not, the Ase overrides the Lav.</p>
<p class="bas indent1"><span class="nm">(s)</span><span class="cl">Answer:</span> The case is, there is no one else to circumcise.</p>
<p class="bas subject"><span class="nm">2)</span>THINGS THAT DO NOT OVERRIDE SHABBOS AND YOM TOV</p>
<p class="bas indent1"><span class="nm">(a)</span><span class="cl">(Beraisa):</span> Milah overrides Yom Tov only in its time.</p>
<p class="bas indent1"><span class="nm">(b)</span><span class="cl">Question:</span> What is the source of this?</p>
<p class="bas indent1"><span class="nm">(c)</span><span class="cl">Answer #1 (Chizkiyah) Question:</span> It already says "V'Lo Sosiru Mimenu Ad Boker" (do not leave meat of the Korban Pesach until morning) - why does it repeat "[Veha'Nosar Mimenu] Ad Boker [ba'Esh Tisrofu]"?</p>
<p class="bas indent2"><span class="nm">1.</span><span class="cl">Answer:</span> This teaches that it is burned on the second morning (the 16th, it does not override Yom Tov - likewise, Milah after its time does not override Yom Tov.)</p>
<p class="bas indent1"><span class="nm">(d)</span><span class="cl">Answer #2 (Abaye):</span> "Olas Shabas b'Shabato" - one may not offer an Olah of Chol on Shabbos or Yom Tov (e.g. if a Korban was slaughtered on Erev Shabbos or Erev Yom Tov, we may not offer its Eimurim at night - this is like Milah not in its time).</p>
<p class="bas indent1"><span class="nm">(e)</span><span class="cl">Answer #3 (Rava):</span> "Hu Levado Ye'aseh Lachem" (only Melachas Ochel Nefesh is permitted on Yom Tov), not Machshirav (e.g. to build an oven) - all the more so, Milah after its time is forbidden.</p>
<p class="bas indent1"><span class="nm">(f)</span><span class="cl">Answer #4 (Rav Ashi):</span> "Shabason" is an Ase [in addition to the Lav] forbidding Melachah on Yom Tov - an Ase (circumcision) does not override a Lav and an Ase.</p>
<p class="bas indent1"><span class="nm">(g)</span><span class="cl">(Mishnah - R. Akiva):</span> The general rule is [a Melachah [for the sake of Milah] overrides Shabbos only if it cannot be done before Shabbos].</p>
<p class="bas indent1"><span class="nm">(h)</span><span class="cl">(Rav Yehudah):</span> The Halachah follows R. Akiva.</p>
<p class="bas indent1"><span class="nm">(i)</span>R. Akiva taught similarly regarding Korban Pesach:</p>
<p class="bas indent2"><span class="nm">1.</span><span class="cl">(Mishnah - R. Akiva):</span> The general rule is - a Melachah [for Korban Pesach] overrides Shabbos only if it cannot be done before Shabbos, e.g. slaughter.</p>
<p class="bas indent2"><span class="nm">2.</span><span class="cl">(Rav Yehudah):</span> The Halachah follows R. Akiva.</p>
<p class="bas indent1"><span class="nm">(j)</span>Rav Yehudah needed to say this about both Mishnayos:</p>
<p class="bas indent2"><span class="nm">1.</span>If he only taught regarding Milah, one might have thought that this is because there is no Kares (for not circumcising on day eight), but since there is Kares for not bringing Pesach, even Machshirim are permitted;</p>
<p class="bas indent2"><span class="nm">2.</span>If he only taught regarding Pesach, one might have thought that Machshirim of Milah are permitted, for 13 covenants were made over Milah.</p>
<p class="bas subject"><span class="nm">3)</span>WHAT MAY BE DONE FOR <i>MILAH</i> ON SHABBOS</p>
<p class="bas indent1"><span class="nm">(a)</span><span class="cl">(Mishnah):</span> One may do all needs of Milah on Shabbos - cutting the foreskin, Pri'ah (pulling back the skin that covers the end of the Ever), sucking out the blood (without antiseptics, it is dangerous not to do so), putting on a bandage and cumin;</p>
<p class="bas indent1"><span class="nm">(b)</span>If one did not grind the cumin before Shabbos, one chews it with his teeth and puts it on (Tosfos - even though one may Mechalel Shabbos for the baby, we use a Shinuy when possible);</p>
<p class="bas indent1"><span class="nm">(c)</span>If one did not mix wine and oil (this was used to heal) before Shabbos, each is put by itself;</p>
<p class="bas indent1"><span class="nm">(d)</span>One may not make a 'cloak' for the Ever (a piece of cloth with a hole for the crown to go through, the cloth covers the Ever and prevents the skin pulled back from returning), but one may wrap a rag around it;</p>
<p class="bas indent2"><span class="nm">1.</span>If one did not prepare it before Shabbos, one may wrap it on his finger and bring it, even from a different Chatzer.</p>
<p class="bas bbbline">133b----------------------------------------133b</p>
<p class="bas indent1"><span class="nm">(e)</span><span class="cl">(Gemara) Question:</span> The Mishnah lists all needs of Milah - what is included by 'One may do all needs of Milah'?</p>
<p class="bas indent1"><span class="nm">(f)</span><span class="cl">Answer (Beraisa):</span>  [On Shabbos,] as long as one is circumcising, he may cut strands whether or not they are Me'akev (invalidate the Milah);</p>
<p class="bas indent2"><span class="nm">1.</span>Once he removes his hand, he may go back to cut strands only if they are Me'akev.</p>
<p class="bas indent1"><span class="nm">(g)</span><span class="cl">Question:</span> Who is the Tana of the Beraisa, who forbids going back to cut strands that are not are Me'akev?</p>
<p class="bas indent1"><span class="nm">(h)</span><span class="cl">Answer #1 (Rabah bar bar Chanah):</span> It is R. Yishmael, son of R. Yochanan ben Brokah:</p>
<p class="bas indent2"><span class="nm">1.</span><span class="cl">(Beraisa - R. Yishmael):</span> If Erev Pesach is on Shabbos, we flay Korban Pesach until the chest (then stop to remove and deal with the Eimurim), we flay the rest at night;</p>
<p class="bas indent2"><span class="nm">2.</span>Chachamim say, it is flayed entirely on Shabbos.</p>
<p class="bas indent1"><span class="nm">(i)</span><span class="cl">Rejection:</span> R. Yishmael does not allow flaying it entirely because "Zeh Keli v'Anvehu" does not apply [after the Eimurim were removed], but it applies to the Mitzvah of Milah, he would permit non-essential strands!</p>
<p class="bas indent2"><span class="nm">1.</span><span class="cl">(Beraisa):</span> "Zeh Keli v'Anvehu" - be beautiful in front of Hash-m with Mitzvos - make a beautiful Sukah, Lulav, Tzitzis, and a beautiful Sefer Torah written Lishmo in nice ink with a nice quill by a professional scribe, and wrap it in nice silk!</p>
<p class="bas indent2"><span class="nm">2.</span>Aba Sha'ul says, "V'Anvehu" [is like 'Ani v'Hu'] - resemble Him - just like He is gracious and merciful, you should be!</p>
<p class="bas indent1"><span class="nm">(j)</span><span class="cl">Answer #2 (Rav Ashi):</span> It is R. Yosi:</p>
<p class="bas indent2"><span class="nm">1.</span><span class="cl">(Mishnah):</span> If the new moon was seen on Shabbos, whether or not it was clearly seen by everyone, witnesses desecrate Shabbos in any way necessary in order to come to Yerushalayim to testify;</p>
<p class="bas indent2"><span class="nm">2.</span>R. Yosi says, if it was clearly seen by everyone, they may not desecrate Shabbos (presumably, Beis Din or others nearby saw it).</p>
<p class="bas indent1"><span class="nm">(k)</span><span class="cl">Rejection:</span> R. Yosi forbids Chilul Shabbos when there is no need to override Shabbos at all - but when we must override Shabbos in any case [for Milah], he agrees that we may do the Mitzvah in its entirety.</p>
<p class="bas indent1"><span class="nm">(l)</span><span class="cl">Answer #3 (Chachamim of Neharda'a):</span> It is Chachamim that argue with R. Yosi:</p>
<p class="bas indent2"><span class="nm">1.</span><span class="cl">(Mishnah):</span> Four Kohanim enter, two are holding Lechem ha'Panim (each holds a stack of six loaves), each of the other two holds a spoon of Levonah;</p>
<p class="bas indent2"><span class="nm">2.</span>Four Kohanim enter before them, two of them remove [last week's] Lechem ha'Panim from the Shulchan, the other two remove the two spoons of Levonah.</p>
<p class="bas indent2"><span class="nm">3.</span>As the removers pull the old bread off the Shulchan, those opposite them put the new bread on the Shulchan, immediately filling the void, to fulfill "Lefanai Tamid".</p>
<p class="bas indent2"><span class="nm">4.</span>R. Yosi says, even if the latter put the new bread on after the old bread is totally off the Shulchan, this fulfills "Tamid". (He would similarly say that even if the Mohel removed his hand, he is 'Tamid' (constantly) engaged in circumcising - Chachamim would say he has stopped, and may go back only if the strands are Me'akev.)</p>
<p class="bas indent1"><span class="nm">(m)</span><span class="cl">(Beraisa):</span> We cut strands [that are Me'akev] - if not, he is Chayav Kares.</p>
<p class="bas indent1"><span class="nm">(n)</span><span class="cl">Question:</span> Who is Chayav Kares?</p>
<p class="bas indent1"><span class="nm">(o)</span><span class="cl">Answer #1 (Rav Kahana):</span> The Mohel is Chayav Kares.</p>
<p class="bas indent1"><span class="nm">(p)</span><span class="cl">Objection (Rav Papa):</span> He can say, I did half the job, you (others) can finish!</p>
<p class="bas indent1"><span class="nm">(q)</span><span class="cl">Answer #2 (Rav Papa):</span> An adult [who left strands when circumcising himself] is Chayav Kares.</p>
<p class="bas indent1"><span class="nm">(r)</span><span class="cl">Objection (Rav Ashi):</span> The Beraisa need not teach about an adult - it explicitly says "V'Arel Zachar Asher Lo Yimol [...v'Nichresah]"!</p>
<p class="bas indent1"><span class="nm">(s)</span><span class="cl">Defense of Answer #1 (Rav Ashi):</span> Really, the Mohel is Chayav Kares;</p>
<p class="bas indent2"><span class="nm">1.</span>The case is, he began to circumcise at the very end of Shabbos - he was warned that he would not have enough time to circumcise fully, nevertheless he began - he is Chayav Kares for wounding [without fulfilling the Mitzvah].</p>
<p class="bas subject"><span class="nm">4)</span>HEALING THE <i>MILAH</i> WOUND</p>
<p class="bas indent1"><span class="nm">(a)</span><span class="cl">(Mishnah):</span> Sucking out the blood.</p>
<p class="bas indent1"><span class="nm">(b)</span><span class="cl">(Rav Papa):</span> If a Mohel did not suck, this is dangerous [without antiseptics used today], we do not let him circumcise again.</p>
<p class="bas indent1"><span class="nm">(c)</span><span class="cl">Objection:</span> This is obvious - since we Mechalel Shabbos to suck (extracting the blood is wounding), surely it is dangerous not to!</p>
<p class="bas indent1"><span class="nm">(d)</span><span class="cl">Answer:</span> One might have thought that a pocket of blood is stored there [so sucking it is not wounding - if so, this could be permitted even if there was no danger] - Rav Papa teaches that this is not so, it is 'attached' [to the flesh, like regular blood];</p>
<p class="bas indent2"><span class="nm">1.</span>It was taught with a bandage and cumin, it is like them - if they are not done, it is dangerous.</p>
<p class="bas indent1"><span class="nm">(e)</span><span class="cl">(Mishnah):</span> Putting on a bandage.</p>
<p class="bas indent1"><span class="nm">(f)</span><span class="cl">Abaye's mother:</span> The [ointment to put on a] bandage for all pains consists of seven parts of Chelev and one part of wax;</p>
<p class="bas indent1"><span class="nm">(g)</span><span class="cl">(Rava):</span> It is wax and pitch of trees.</p>
<p class="bas indent1"><span class="nm">(h)</span>Rava taught this in Mechuza - the sons of Minyomi the doctor broke their Kelim (for now people could make this ointment themselves).</p>
<p class="bas indent1"><span class="nm">(i)</span><span class="cl">Rava (to Benei Minyomi):</span> There is one matter I did not reveal - Shmuel taught that if one washes his face and does not dry it well, his face will develop boils (alternatively - crack or form a crust).</p>
<p class="bas indent1"><span class="nm">(j)</span><span class="cl">Question:</span> If someone did so, what remedy is there?</p>
<p class="bas indent1"><span class="nm">(k)</span><span class="cl">Answer:</span> He should wash it liberally in water in which beets were cooked.</p>
