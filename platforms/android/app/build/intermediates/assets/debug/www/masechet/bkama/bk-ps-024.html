<p class="dedicationbox"><br>PAST DEDICATION<br>BAVA KAMA 21-25 - Two weeks of study material have been dedicated by Mrs. Estanne Abraham Fawer to honor the ninth Yahrzeit of her father, Rav Mordechai ben Eliezer Zvi (Rabbi Morton Weiner) Z'L, who passed away on 18 Teves 5760. May the merit of supporting and advancing Dafyomi study -- which was so important to him -- during the weeks of his Yahrzeit serve as an Iluy for his Neshamah. </p>

<p class="bas subject"><span class="nm">1)</span>THE SOURCE FOR WHAT MAKES A <i>MU'AD</i></p>
<p class="bas indent1"><span class="nm">(a)</span><span class="cl">Question:</span> What is R. Meir's reason?</p>
<p class="bas indent1"><span class="nm">(b)</span><span class="cl">Answer:</span> If it becomes Mu'ad after intermittent gorings, all the more so when the gorings are close together!</p>
<p class="bas indent2"><span class="nm">1.</span><span class="cl">Chachamim:</span> A Zavah (a woman who experienced post- menstrual bleeding) disproves this. If she sees blood on three consecutive days, she is a Zavah, but not for three sightings on one day!</p>
<p class="bas indent2"><span class="nm">2.</span><span class="cl">R. Meir:</span> The verse "this is the law of his Tum'ah through his emissions" (mentions emissions three times. This) shows that a Zav (a man who sees Zivah, i.e. emissions of uncooked semen) becomes Tamei through (three) sightings (even if they are in one day), but a Zavah does not (she must see on distinct days. If not for the verse, a Kal va'Chomer would be Metamei a Zavah who had sightings in one day. Our Sugya discusses Tum'ah that persists until seven clean days without sightings. Even a single sighting of blood or Zivah is Metamei for one day.)</p>
<p class="bas indent2"><span class="nm">3.</span><span class="cl">Question:</span> How do we know that "this" excludes a Zavah (from Tum'ah unless she saw on consecutive days)? Perhaps it excludes a Zav from Tum'ah if he sees on consecutive days!</p>
<p class="bas indent2"><span class="nm">4.</span><span class="cl">Answer:</span> "And one who has a flow, a male or a female" equates men and women;</p>
<p class="bas indent3"><span class="nm">i.</span>Just like a woman becomes Temei'ah through sightings on consecutive days, also a man.</p>
<p class="bas indent2"><span class="nm">5.</span><span class="cl">Suggestion:</span> We should also equate them, and say that just like a man becomes Tamei through sightings on one day, also a woman!</p>
<p class="bas indent2"><span class="nm">6.</span><span class="cl">Rejection:</span> "This" excludes a woman.</p>
<p class="bas indent2"><span class="nm">7.</span><span class="cl">Question:</span> Perhaps we should learn oppositely! (A woman becomes Temei'ah through sightings on one day, like a man, and "this" excludes a man who sees on consecutive days.)</p>
<p class="bas indent2"><span class="nm">8.</span><span class="cl">Answer:</span> The verse "this..." discusses sightings (on one day). It is more reasonable to explain that it excludes sightings (of a woman) on one day, than to say that it exclude sightings (of a man) on consecutive days.</p>
<p class="bas indent1"><span class="nm">(c)</span><span class="cl">(Beraisa - R. Yosi):</span> An animal is Mu'ad after witnesses testify that it gored on three days. It reverts to be Tam when children play with it and it does not gore;</p>
<p class="bas indent2"><span class="nm">1.</span>R. Shimon says, after witnesses testify three times that it gored, it is Mu'ad;</p>
<p class="bas indent3"><span class="nm">i.</span>The relevance of three days to a Mu'ad pertains to reverting to being Tam (if it doesn't gore in three days).</p>
<p class="bas indent1"><span class="nm">(d)</span><span class="cl">(Rav Nachman):</span> The Halachah is like R. Yehudah regarding a Mu'ad, and like R. Meir regarding a Tam, because R. Yosi agree with them.</p>
<p class="bas indent1"><span class="nm">(e)</span><span class="cl">Question (Rava):</span> Perhaps the Halachah is like R. Meir regarding a Mu'ad, and like R. Yehudah regarding a Tam, because R. Shimon agrees with them!</p>
<p class="bas indent1"><span class="nm">(f)</span><span class="cl">Answer (Rav Nachman):</span> I hold like R. Yosi because he has superb reasons and proofs.</p>
<p class="bas subject"><span class="nm">2)</span>WHY THREE DAYS ARE NEEDED</p>
<p class="bas indent1"><span class="nm">(a)</span><span class="cl">Question:</span> Are three days required (to make it a Mu'ad) to establish that the ox gores, or to warn the man?</p>
<p class="bas indent2"><span class="nm">1.</span><span class="cl">Question:</span> What difference does it make?</p>
<p class="bas indent2"><span class="nm">2.</span><span class="cl">Answer:</span> If three sets of witnesses testify on one day about gorings on three days, this suffices to establish that the ox gores;</p>
<p class="bas indent3"><span class="nm">i.</span>It does not suffice to warn the man. He can say 'I learned about the gorings only now.'</p>
<p class="bas indent1"><span class="nm">(b)</span><span class="cl">Answer (Beraisa):</span> An ox becomes Mu'ad only if they testify about it in front of the owner and in front of Beis Din;</p>
<p class="bas indent2"><span class="nm">1.</span>If two witnesses testified about the first goring, two about the second, and two about the third, they are three testimonies, but they are considered one testimony regarding Hazamah:</p>
<p class="bas indent2"><span class="nm">2.</span>If the first two witnesses were found to be Zomemim (they testified about something they were not present to see), the latter two testimonies stand. The ox is not Mu'ad, and the Zomemim are not punished (for trying to make the ox Mu'ad);</p>
<p class="bas indent2"><span class="nm">3.</span>If also the next two witnesses were found to be Zomemim, the last testimony stands. The ox is not Mu'ad, and the lying witnesses are not punished;</p>
<p class="bas indent2"><span class="nm">4.</span>If all the witnesses were found to be Zomemim, they are all punished - "you will do to him like he plotted."</p>
<p class="bas indent2"><span class="nm">5.</span>This is like the opinion that the testimony is to establish the ox to gore.</p>
<p class="bas bbbline">24b----------------------------------------24b</p>
<p class="bas indent2"><span class="nm">6.</span>If we need three days to warn the man, why are the first two pairs of witnesses punished? They can say ('we didn't intend to make it Mu'ad.) We didn't know that more witnesses would come!'</p>
<p class="bas indent1"><span class="nm">(c)</span><span class="cl">Question (Rav Kahana):</span> We can ask similarly if the testimony is to establish the ox to gore!</p>
<p class="bas indent2"><span class="nm">1.</span>The witnesses about the last goring can say 'we came only to obligate the owner half-damage. We didn't know why the other witnesses were in Beis Din! (Rashi - the case is, the third victim asked all six witnesses to testify. The witnesses about the first gorings know that he wants to make the ox Mu'ad. Tosfos - the case is, the witnesses about the previous gorings testified only after the witnesses about the last goring. Surely, they wanted to make it Mu'ad! Ra'avad - even the witnesses about the last goring can claim that they came only to obligate half-damage.)</p>
<p class="bas indent1"><span class="nm">(d)</span><span class="cl">Answer #1:</span> The witnesses gestured to each other. (Rashi - this (and the coming) answers are like the opinion that the testimony is to establish the ox like a gorer; Tosfos - the answers are valid also for the opinion that the testimony is to warn the man.)</p>
<p class="bas indent1"><span class="nm">(e)</span><span class="cl">Answer #2 (Rav Ashi):</span> The witnesses came together.</p>
<p class="bas indent1"><span class="nm">(f)</span><span class="cl">Answer #3 (Ravina):</span> The witnesses do not know which ox gored (so they cannot obligate half-damage), but they know whose ox gored.</p>
<p class="bas indent1"><span class="nm">(g)</span><span class="cl">Question:</span> If so, how can they make it Mu'ad?</p>
<p class="bas indent1"><span class="nm">(h)</span><span class="cl">Answer:</span> They say that since the man has a goring ox, he must guard his whole herd.</p>
<p class="bas subject"><span class="nm">3)</span>INCITEMENT TO GORE</p>
<p class="bas indent1"><span class="nm">(a)</span><span class="cl">Question:</span> If Levi incited Reuven's dog to bite Shimon, what is the law?</p>
<p class="bas indent2"><span class="nm">1.</span>Surely, Levi is exempt (he merely caused damage). Is Reuven liable?</p>
<p class="bas indent2"><span class="nm">2.</span>Can he say 'I didn't do anything!'</p>
<p class="bas indent2"><span class="nm">3.</span>Or, since he knows that his dog can be incited, he should not have such a dog!</p>
<p class="bas indent1"><span class="nm">(b)</span><span class="cl">Answer (R. Zeira - Mishnah):</span> If an animal does not gore when children play with it, it is Tam;</p>
<p class="bas indent2"><span class="nm">1.</span><span class="cl">(Inference):</span> If it gores other oxen (when incited by children), it is liable!</p>
<p class="bas indent1"><span class="nm">(c)</span><span class="cl">Rejection (Abaye):</span> No. If it gores when incited, it is Mu'ad, but it is exempt for that goring.</p>
<p class="bas indent1"><span class="nm">(d)</span><span class="cl">(Mishnah):</span> If a man incited a dog or snake to bite, he is exempt.</p>
<p class="bas indent1"><span class="nm">(e)</span><span class="cl">Question:</span> Who is exempt?</p>
<p class="bas indent2"><span class="nm">1.</span><span class="cl">Suggestion:</span> The inciter is exempt, but the owner of the dog or snake is liable.</p>
<p class="bas indent1"><span class="nm">(f)</span><span class="cl">Answer:</span> No, even the inciter is exempt.</p>
<p class="bas indent1"><span class="nm">(g)</span><span class="cl">(Rava):</span> Even if you will say that when Levi incited Reuven's dog to bite Shimon, Reuven is liable, but if it bit Levi, Reuven is exempt.</p>
<p class="bas indent2"><span class="nm">1.</span>This is because if one party does something abnormal, and another party acts abnormally and damages the first, the second party is exempt.</p>
<p class="bas indent1"><span class="nm">(h)</span><span class="cl">(Rav Papa):</span> Reish Lakish supports Rava.</p>
<p class="bas indent2"><span class="nm">1.</span><span class="cl">(Reish Lakish):</span> If a cow was crouching in a Reshus ha'Rabim, and another cow was walking, and the walking cow kicked the crouching cow, it is exempt;</p>
<p class="bas indent2"><span class="nm">2.</span>If the crouching cow kicked the walking cow, it is liable.</p>
<p class="bas indent1"><span class="nm">(i)</span><span class="cl">(Rava):</span> I say that even in the first case, it is liable. The walking cow has the right to walk over the crouching cow, but it may not kick it.</p>
<p class="bas subject"><span class="nm">4)</span><i>KEREN</i> IN THE VICTIM'S PREMISES</p>
<p class="bas indent1"><span class="nm">(a)</span><span class="cl">(Mishnah):</span> What is the law of an ox that damaged in the victim's premises?</p>
<p class="bas indent1"><span class="nm">(b)</span>If it gored, pushed, bit, crouched or kicked in Reshus ha'Rabim, it pays half-damage;</p>
<p class="bas indent1"><span class="nm">(c)</span>In the victim's premises, R. Tarfon obligates full damage;</p>
<p class="bas indent1"><span class="nm">(d)</span>Chachamim say, it pays half-damage.</p>
<p class="bas indent2"><span class="nm">1.</span><span class="cl">R. Tarfon:</span> In a Reshus ha'Rabim, the Torah is lenient to exempt Shen and Regel, but they pay full damage in the victim's premises. Keren pays half- damage in a Reshus ha'Rabim. All the more so it pays full damage in the victim's premises!</p>
<p class="bas indent2"><span class="nm">2.</span><span class="cl">Chachamim:</span> Dayo (we cannot learn from a Kal va'Chomer more than the source). Just like Keren pays half-damage in a Reshus ha'Rabim, also in the victim's premises.</p>
<p class="bas indent2"><span class="nm">3.</span><span class="cl">R. Tarfon:</span> I need not learn Keren from Keren. I can learn Keren from Regel!</p>
<p class="bas indent3"><span class="nm">i.</span>In a Reshus ha'Rabim, the Torah is lenient to exempt Shen and Regel, but Keren pays half- damage. In the victim's premises, where Shen and Regel pay full damage, all the more so Keren pays full damage!</p>
<p class="bas indent2"><span class="nm">4.</span><span class="cl">Chachamim:</span> Dayo. It pays only half-damage, like in a Reshus ha'Rabim.</p>
