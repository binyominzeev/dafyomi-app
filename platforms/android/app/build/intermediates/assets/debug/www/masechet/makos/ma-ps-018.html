<p class="bas indent1"><span class="nm">(a)</span><span class="cl">Answer #2:</span> Rather, we expound a different verse - "va'Haveisem Shamah Oloseichem v'Zivcheichem... va'Achaltem Sham";</p>
<p class="bas indent2"><span class="nm">1.</span><span class="cl">Question:</span> Why does the Torah list all of them again? It could have said 'Lo Suchal l'Achlam'!</p>
<p class="bas indent2"><span class="nm">2.</span><span class="cl">Answer:</span> They are repeated to forbid each with a Lav. (Tosfos - indeed, if a Zar eats Olah before Zerikah outside the wall, he is lashed five times; Rashi - it suffices to learn lashes for eating before Zerikah (or Bikurim before Kri'ah). Lashes for eating Kodshim outside are from "u'Vasar ba'Sadeh Treifah Lo Socheilu" (below)).</p>
<p class="bas indent1"><span class="nm">(b)</span><span class="cl">(Rava):</span> If a Zar eats Olah before Zerikah outside the wall of Yerushalayim, according to R. Shimon he is lashed five times.</p>
<p class="bas indent1"><span class="nm">(c)</span><span class="cl">Question:</span> He should be lashed also for "v'Zar Lo Yochal Ki Kodesh Hem"!</p>
<p class="bas indent1"><span class="nm">(d)</span><span class="cl">Answer:</span> That applies only to Kodshim permitted to a Kohen. Olah is forbidden even to Kohanim.</p>
<p class="bas indent1"><span class="nm">(e)</span><span class="cl">Question:</span> He should also be lashed for "u'Vasar ba'Sadeh Treifah Lo Socheilu" - once meat leaves its (allowed) border, it is forbidden!</p>
<p class="bas indent1"><span class="nm">(f)</span><span class="cl">Answer:</span> That applies only to meat permitted in its boundary. Olah is forbidden everywhere.</p>
<p class="bas indent1"><span class="nm">(g)</span><span class="cl">Question:</span> He should also be lashed due to R. Eliezer's law!</p>
<p class="bas indent2"><span class="nm">1.</span><span class="cl">(R. Eliezer):</span> "Lo Yochal Ki Kodesh Hem" - one is lashed for eating any Pasul Kodshim.</p>
<p class="bas bbbline">18b----------------------------------------18b</p>
<p class="bas indent2"><span class="nm">2.</span><span class="cl">Answer:</span> This is only if it was permitted before it became Pasul. Here, it was always forbidden.</p>
<p class="bas indent1"><span class="nm">(h)</span><span class="cl">Question:</span> He should be lashed due to R. Eliezer's other law!</p>
<p class="bas indent2"><span class="nm">1.</span><span class="cl">(Beraisa - R. Eliezer):</span> Wherever it says 'Kalil Tihyeh (it will be entirely burned)', there is a Lav not to eat it.</p>
<p class="bas indent1"><span class="nm">(i)</span><span class="cl">Answer:</span> Rava teaches only about the lashes that R. Shimon expounded from "Lo Suchal Le'chol bi'She'arecha..."</p>
<p class="bas indent1"><span class="nm">(j)</span><span class="cl">Version #1 (Rav Gidal):</span> If a Kohen eats Chatas or Asham before Zerikah, he is lashed.</p>
<p class="bas indent1"><span class="nm">(k)</span><span class="cl">Question:</span> What is the reason?</p>
<p class="bas indent1"><span class="nm">(l)</span><span class="cl">Answer:</span> "V'Achlu Osam Asher Kupar Bahem" - they may eat only after Kaparah;</p>
<p class="bas indent2"><span class="nm">1.</span>A Lav inferred from an Aseh is like a Lav. One is lashed for it.</p>
<p class="bas indent1"><span class="nm">(m)</span><span class="cl">Objection (Rava):</span> "V'Chol Behemah Mafreses Parsah... Osah Tochelu" - you may not eat other animals;</p>
<p class="bas indent2"><span class="nm">1.</span>If one is lashed for a Lav inferred from an Aseh, why must it say "Es Zeh Lo Sochlu"?</p>
<p class="bas indent1"><span class="nm">(n)</span><span class="cl">Version #2 (Rav Gidal):</span> If a Zar eats Chatas or Asham before Zerikah, he is exempt.</p>
<p class="bas indent1"><span class="nm">(o)</span><span class="cl">Question:</span> What is the reason?</p>
<p class="bas indent1"><span class="nm">(p)</span><span class="cl">Answer:</span> "V'Zar Lo Yochal Ki Kodesh Hem" applies only when (the beginning of the verse) "v'Achlu Osam Asher Kupar Bahem" applies, i.e. after Zerikah, when Kohanim may eat them.</p>
<p class="bas subject"><span class="nm">2)</span>WHAT IS <i>ME'AKEV</i> WHEN OFFERING <i>BIKURIM</i>?</p>
<p class="bas indent1"><span class="nm">(a)</span><span class="cl">Version #1 (R. Elazar):</span> Hanachah is Me'akev Bikurim. Kri'ah is not Me'akev.</p>
<p class="bas indent1"><span class="nm">(b)</span><span class="cl">Contradiction:</span> R. Elazar said that if Reuven separated Bikurim before Sukos, and did not bring them before Sukos, he must let them rot (for we do not do Kri'ah after Sukos)!</p>
<p class="bas indent1"><span class="nm">(c)</span><span class="cl">Answer:</span> He cannot bring them after Sukos due to R. Zeira's law;</p>
<p class="bas indent2"><span class="nm">1.</span><span class="cl">(R. Zeira):</span> If a Minchah is small enough that the flour could be mixed with the oil, even it was not mixed, it is valid;</p>
<p class="bas indent2"><span class="nm">2.</span>If it is too big (60 Esronim, there is not enough oil or room in the vessel to mix it), it is invalid because it was not mixed (nor even possible to mix it)! (Here also, since he cannot do Kri'ah, this disqualifies them!)</p>
<p class="bas indent1"><span class="nm">(d)</span><span class="cl">Version #2 - Rav Acha bar Yakov - (Rav Asi citing R. Yochanan):</span> Hanachah is Me'akev Bikurim. Kri'ah is not Me'akev.</p>
<p class="bas indent1"><span class="nm">(e)</span><span class="cl">Contradiction - Question (Rav Asi):</span> When are Bikurim permitted to Kohanim?</p>
<p class="bas indent2"><span class="nm">1.</span><span class="cl">Answer (R. Yochanan):</span> Bikurim for which Kri'ah can be done are permitted after Kri'ah. Bikurim for which Kri'ah cannot be done are permitted after they enter the Azarah (courtyard of the Mikdash).</p>
<p class="bas indent2"><span class="nm">2.</span>This implies that Kri'ah is Me'akev, but Hanachah is not Me'akev!</p>
<p class="bas indent1"><span class="nm">(f)</span><span class="cl">Resolution - part 1:</span> He said that Kri'ah is Me'akev according to R. Shimon. He said that it is not Me'akev according to Chachamim.</p>
<p class="bas indent1"><span class="nm">(g)</span><span class="cl">Resolution - part 2:</span> He said that Hanachah is Me'akev according to R. Yehudah. He said that it is not Me'akev according to Chachamim.</p>
<p class="bas indent2"><span class="nm">1.</span><span class="cl">(Beraisa - R. Yehudah):</span> "V'Hinachto" refers to Tenufah (waving).</p>
<p class="bas indent2"><span class="nm">2.</span><span class="cl">Question:</span> Perhaps it really refers to Hanachah!</p>
<p class="bas indent2"><span class="nm">3.</span><span class="cl">Rejection:</span> "V'Hinicho" already teaches about Hanachah, so "v'Hinachto" must refer to Tenufah.</p>
<p class="bas indent1"><span class="nm">(h)</span><span class="cl">Question:</span> Who is the Tana that argues with R. Yehudah?</p>
<p class="bas indent1"><span class="nm">(i)</span><span class="cl">Answer:</span> It is R. Eliezer ben Yakov;</p>
<p class="bas indent2"><span class="nm">1.</span><span class="cl">(Beraisa - R. Eliezer ben Yakov):</span> "V'Lakach ha'Kohen ha'Tene mi'Yadecha" teaches that Bikurim require Tenufah.</p>
<p class="bas indent2"><span class="nm">2.</span><span class="cl">Question:</span> What is his reason?</p>
<p class="bas indent2"><span class="nm">3.</span><span class="cl">Answer:</span> He learns a Gezerah Shavah "Yad-Yad" between Bikurim and Shelamim (regarding which it says "Yadav Tevi'enu");</p>
<p class="bas indent3"><span class="nm">i.</span>Just like the Kohen must wave Bikurim, he must wave also Shelamim;</p>
<p class="bas indent3"><span class="nm">ii.</span>Just like the owner must wave Shelamim, he must wave also Bikurim.</p>
<p class="bas indent3"><span class="nm">iii.</span><span class="cl">Question:</span> How do the Kohen and owner do Tenufah (at the same time)?</p>
<p class="bas indent3"><span class="nm">iv.</span><span class="cl">Answer:</span> The Kohen puts his hands under the owner's, and they wave it together.</p>
