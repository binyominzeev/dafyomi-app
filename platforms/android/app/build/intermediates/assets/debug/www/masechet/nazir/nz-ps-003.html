<p class="bas indent1"><span class="nm">(a)</span><span class="cl">Answer:</span> It is called beautiful. Even R. Elazar ha'Kapar, who calls a Nazir a sinner, says so only regarding a Tamei Nazir;</p>
<p class="bas indent2"><span class="nm">1.</span>"The first days will fall" - since he must begin Nezirus again from scratch, he may come to transgress.</p>
<p class="bas indent2"><span class="nm">2.</span>He does not call a Tahor Nazir a sinner.</p>
<p class="bas indent1"><span class="nm">(b)</span><span class="cl">(Mishnah):</span> If one said 'I will be like this one' (he is a Nazir).</p>
<p class="bas indent1"><span class="nm">(c)</span><span class="cl">Question:</span> Even if he was holding his hair, 'like this one' has no connotation of Nezirus!</p>
<p class="bas indent1"><span class="nm">(d)</span><span class="cl">Answer (Shmuel):</span> The case is, a Nazir passed in front of him.</p>
<p class="bas indent1"><span class="nm">(e)</span><span class="cl">(Mishnah):</span> If one said 'I will be Mesalsel (curl)...'</p>
<p class="bas indent2"><span class="nm">1.</span><span class="cl">Question:</span> What is the source that Mesalsel refers to hair?</p>
<p class="bas indent2"><span class="nm">2.</span><span class="cl">Answer:</span> Rebbi's female slave rebuked a man 'how long will you be Mesalsel your hair?'</p>
<p class="bas indent1"><span class="nm">(f)</span><span class="cl">Question:</span> Perhaps he referred to Torah, like it says "Salselah and it will elevate you!"</p>
<p class="bas indent1"><span class="nm">(g)</span><span class="cl">Answer (Shmuel):</span> He was holding his hair when he said this.</p>
<p class="bas indent1"><span class="nm">(h)</span><span class="cl">(Mishnah):</span> If one said 'I will be Mekalkel...'</p>
<p class="bas indent2"><span class="nm">1.</span><span class="cl">Question:</span> What is the source that Mekalkel refers to hair?</p>
<p class="bas indent2"><span class="nm">2.</span><span class="cl">Answer (Mishnah - R. Yehudah):</span> One is liable for transferring (to Reshus ha'Rabim on Shabbos) the amount of plaster needed for a Kilkul.</p>
<p class="bas indent3"><span class="nm">i.</span><span class="cl">(Rav):</span> This is the temple (on the face).</p>
<p class="bas indent1"><span class="nm">(i)</span><span class="cl">Question:</span> Perhaps he meant that he will finance - "va'Yechalkel Yosef (he sustained) his father and brothers"!</p>
<p class="bas indent1"><span class="nm">(j)</span><span class="cl">Answer (Shmuel):</span> He was holding his hair when he said this.</p>
<p class="bas indent1"><span class="nm">(k)</span><span class="cl">(Mishnah):</span> If one said 'it is Alai to be Leshale'ach long hair', he is a Nazir.</p>
<p class="bas indent2"><span class="nm">1.</span><span class="cl">Question:</span> What is the source that Shilu'ach means growing?</p>
<p class="bas indent2"><span class="nm">2.</span><span class="cl">Answer:</span> "Shelachayich are (like) a pomegranate orchard."</p>
<p class="bas indent1"><span class="nm">(l)</span><span class="cl">Question:</span> Perhaps he meant that he will (cut it and) send it away - "V'Shole'ach (He sends) water outside..."</p>
<p class="bas indent1"><span class="nm">(m)</span><span class="cl">Answer #1:</span> We learn from a Gezeirah Shavah "Pera-Pera";</p>
<p class="bas indent2"><span class="nm">1.</span>It says regarding Nazir "he will grow Pera." It says regarding Kohanim "u'Fera Lo Yeshalechu." (This teaches that a Kohen may not grow his hair longer than 30 days.)</p>
<p class="bas indent1"><span class="nm">(n)</span><span class="cl">Answer #2:</span> The verse "V'Shole'ach Mayim" also refers to growing!</p>
<p class="bas indent2"><span class="nm">1.</span>Watering plants causes them to grow.</p>
<p class="bas subject"><span class="nm">2)</span>'I WILL BRING BIRDS'</p>
<p class="bas indent1"><span class="nm">(a)</span><span class="cl">(Mishnah - R. Meir):</span> If one said 'it is Alai to bring Tziporim (birds)', he is a Nazir.</p>
<p class="bas indent1"><span class="nm">(b)</span><span class="cl">Question:</span> What is R. Meir's reason?</p>
<p class="bas indent1"><span class="nm">(c)</span><span class="cl">Answer #1 (Reish Lakish):</span> The man referred to (a Mitzvah that entails bringing) birds associated with hair, like in the verse "his (Nevuchadnetzar's) hair grew like eagle's wings, and his nails like a bird's claws."</p>
<p class="bas indent2"><span class="nm">1.</span>R. Meir holds that a person vows by using a word that is (in a verse) near the matters he intends to vow about.</p>
<p class="bas bbbline">3b----------------------------------------3b</p>
<p class="bas indent2"><span class="nm">2.</span>Chachamim hold that a person does not do this.</p>
<p class="bas indent1"><span class="nm">(d)</span><span class="cl">Objection (R. Yochanan):</span> All agree that a person does not do this!</p>
<p class="bas indent1"><span class="nm">(e)</span><span class="cl">Answer #2 (R. Yochanan):</span> R. Meir's reason is, he suspects the person meant Nezirus, for which a person brings birds if he becomes Tamei.</p>
<p class="bas indent1"><span class="nm">(f)</span><span class="cl">Question:</span> R. Meir only suspects that he meant Nezirus. Perhaps he meant a Nedavah (voluntary Korban) of birds! (Why is he a Nazir?)</p>
<p class="bas indent1"><span class="nm">(g)</span><span class="cl">Answer:</span> Had he meant a Nedavah, he would have said 'Ken' (the word normally used for this), not Tziporim.</p>
<p class="bas indent1"><span class="nm">(h)</span><span class="cl">Question:</span> Perhaps he accepted to supply birds needed for Taharas Metzora!</p>
<p class="bas indent1"><span class="nm">(i)</span><span class="cl">Answer:</span> The case is, a Nazir passed in front of him when he vowed.</p>
<p class="bas indent1"><span class="nm">(j)</span><span class="cl">Question:</span> Perhaps he accepted to supply the birds that a Tamei Nazir must bring?</p>
<p class="bas indent1"><span class="nm">(k)</span><span class="cl">Answer:</span> A Tahor Nazir passed in front of him. (It is unreasonable to say that he accepted to bring his birds if the Nazir will become Tamei.)</p>
<p class="bas indent1"><span class="nm">(l)</span><span class="cl">Question:</span> Practically, in what case do R. Yochanan and Reish Lakish argue?</p>
<p class="bas indent1"><span class="nm">(m)</span><span class="cl">Answer:</span> They argue about one who said 'it is Alai to bring birds that are (in a verse) close to hair.'</p>
<p class="bas indent2"><span class="nm">1.</span>R. Yochanan holds that he is a Nazir only if a Nazir passed in front of him at the time. Reish Lakish holds that he is a Nazir even if a Nazir did not pass.</p>
<p class="bas indent1"><span class="nm">(n)</span><span class="cl">Question:</span> Surely, all agree that people vow using a word near the matter he intends to vow about!</p>
<p class="bas indent2"><span class="nm">1.</span><span class="cl">(Beraisa):</span> If one said 'right (hand)', this is an oath.</p>
<p class="bas indent2"><span class="nm">2.</span><span class="cl">Suggestion:</span> He refers to the Shevu'ah in the verse "He raised his right hand... and swore"!</p>
<p class="bas indent1"><span class="nm">(o)</span><span class="cl">Answer:</span> No, he refers to Hash-m's right hand. This itself (the reference to Hash-m) connotes an oath:</p>
<p class="bas indent2"><span class="nm">1.</span><span class="cl">(Beraisa):</span> If one said 'right hand', this is an oath - "Hash-m swore by His right hand."</p>
<p class="bas indent2"><span class="nm">2.</span><span class="cl">Question:</span> What is the source that if one said 'left (hand)', this is an oath?</p>
<p class="bas indent2"><span class="nm">3.</span><span class="cl">Answer:</span> We learn from "And in His left hand is strength."</p>
<p class="bas subject"><span class="nm">3)</span>ONE WHO ACCEPTS PARTIAL <i>NEZIRUS</i></p>
<p class="bas indent1"><span class="nm">(a)</span><span class="cl">(Mishnah):</span> If one said 'I am a Nazir from grape skins', 'from grape pits', 'from shaving', (or) 'from Tum'ah', all laws of Nezirus apply to him.</p>
<p class="bas indent1"><span class="nm">(b)</span><span class="cl">(Gemara):</span> The Mishnah is unlike R. Shimon:</p>
<p class="bas indent2"><span class="nm">1.</span><span class="cl">(Beraisa - R. Shimon):</span> One is only a Nazir if he vows to abstain from all three Isurim;</p>
<p class="bas indent2"><span class="nm">2.</span>Chachamim say, (he is a Nazir) even if he only vows from one of them.</p>
<p class="bas indent1"><span class="nm">(c)</span><span class="cl">Question:</span> What is R. Shimon's reason?</p>
<p class="bas indent1"><span class="nm">(d)</span><span class="cl">Answer:</span> He learns from "from anything made out of grapevines, from grape skins to grape pits." (Rosh - this teaches that if he specifies, he must specify everything.)</p>
<p class="bas indent2"><span class="nm">1.</span>Chachamim learn from "from wine and strong drink he will abstain." (He need not vow from everything.)</p>
<p class="bas indent1"><span class="nm">(e)</span><span class="cl">Question:</span> What does R. Shimon learn from this verse?</p>
<p class="bas indent1"><span class="nm">(f)</span><span class="cl">Answer:</span> It teaches that a Nazir is forbidden to wine of a Mitzvah just like optional wine.</p>
