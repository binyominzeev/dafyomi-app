<p class="dedicationbox">BAVA BASRA 2-8 - Two weeks of study material have been dedicated by Mrs. Estanne Abraham Fawer to honor the Yahrzeit of her father, Rav Mordechai ben Eliezer Zvi (Rabbi Morton Weiner) Z'L, who passed away on 18 Teves 5760. May the merit of supporting and advancing Dafyomi study -- which was so important to Rav Weiner -- during the weeks of his Yahrzeit serve as an Iluy for his Neshamah. </p>

<p class="bas subject"><span class="nm">1)</span>ADVISING HEROD TO REBUILD THE MIKDASH</p>
<p class="bas indent1"><span class="nm">(a)</span>Herod poked out the eyes of Bava ben Buta (Benyahu (ben Yehoyada) - he put a crown of herbs on him to subtly blind him), and tested him.</p>
<p class="bas indent2"><span class="nm">1.</span><span class="cl">Herod:</span> Do you see what that lowly slave (Herod) did?!</p>
<p class="bas indent2"><span class="nm">2.</span><span class="cl">Bava ben Buta:</span> What should I do?</p>
<p class="bas indent2"><span class="nm">3.</span><span class="cl">Herod:</span> Curse him!</p>
<p class="bas indent2"><span class="nm">4.</span><span class="cl">Bava ben Buta:</span> "Gam b'Mada'acha Melech Al Tekalel."</p>
<p class="bas indent2"><span class="nm">5.</span><span class="cl">Herod:</span> He is not really a king!</p>
<p class="bas indent2"><span class="nm">6.</span><span class="cl">Bava ben Buta:</span> He is no less than a rich person or Nasi. It says "u'Vchadrei Mishkavecha Al Tekalel Ashir" and "v'Nasi v'Amecha Lo Sa'or."</p>
<p class="bas indent2"><span class="nm">7.</span><span class="cl">Herod:</span> "V'Amecha" refers to one who acts like one of your nation. Herod does not!</p>
<p class="bas indent2"><span class="nm">8.</span><span class="cl">Bava ben Buta:</span> I fear him.</p>
<p class="bas indent2"><span class="nm">9.</span><span class="cl">Herod:</span> He will not find out. No one else is here!</p>
<p class="bas indent2"><span class="nm">10.</span><span class="cl">Bava ben Buta:</span> "Ki Of ha'Shamayim Yolich Es ha'Kol."</p>
<p class="bas indent2"><span class="nm">11.</span><span class="cl">Herod:</span> I am Herod. Had I known that Chachamim are so careful, I would not have killed them! What should I do to correct my mistake?</p>
<p class="bas indent2"><span class="nm">12.</span><span class="cl">Bava ben Buta:</span> You destroyed (Chachamim,) the light of the world - "Ki Ner Mitzvah v'Sorah Ohr." Go fix (the Mikdash,) the light of the world - "v'Naharu Elav Kol ha'Goyim."</p>
<p class="bas indent2"><span class="nm">13.</span><span class="cl">Herod:</span> I fear the kingdom (of Romi)!</p>
<p class="bas indent2"><span class="nm">14.</span><span class="cl">Bava ben Buta:</span> Send them a messenger asking permission to destroy and rebuild it. The messenger will tarry one year on the way, one year in Romi, and a year on the way back. By then, you will have finished it!</p>
<p class="bas indent1"><span class="nm">(b)</span><span class="cl">Herod did so. Romi answered:</span> if you did not yet destroy it, do not. If you already destroyed it, do not rebuild it. If you already rebuild it, that is lowly, to ask permission after the fact!</p>
<p class="bas indent2"><span class="nm">1.</span>We know that you are really a slave who killed his masters!</p>
<p class="bas indent1"><span class="nm">(c)</span>One who did not see the rebuilt Mikdash never saw a beautiful building.</p>
<p class="bas indent2"><span class="nm">1.</span><span class="cl">(Rabah):</span> He used grayish-brown marble and white marble.</p>
<p class="bas indent3"><span class="nm">i.</span>Some say that he also used blue stones.</p>
<p class="bas indent2"><span class="nm">2.</span>He staggered the rows, to leave room for plaster in between.</p>
<p class="bas indent2"><span class="nm">3.</span>He thought to cover it with gold. Chachamim said that it is better as it is. It looks like waves and delights the eye.</p>
<p class="bas indent1"><span class="nm">(d)</span><span class="cl">Question:</span> Why did Bava ben Buta counsel him this way?</p>
<p class="bas indent2"><span class="nm">1.</span><span class="cl">(Rav Yehudah):</span> Daniel was punished for counseling the evil Nebuchadnetzar (to do a Mitzvah) - "v'Chata'ach b'Tzidkah Feruk (redeem your sin through Tzedakah)...Teheve Archah li'Shlevsach (and you will have serenity for a long time);</p>
<p class="bas indent3"><span class="nm">i.</span>Nebuchadnetzar's Tzedakah delayed his punishment for 12 months!</p>
<p class="bas indent1"><span class="nm">(e)</span><span class="cl">Answer #1:</span> Herod was a slave, who is obligated to keep the Mitzvos, therefore he gave this counsel.</p>
<p class="bas indent1"><span class="nm">(f)</span><span class="cl">Answer #2:</span> The only one who could rebuild the Mikdash was (Herod,) the king.</p>
<p class="bas indent1"><span class="nm">(g)</span><span class="cl">Question:</span> How do we know that Daniel was punished?</p>
<p class="bas indent1"><span class="nm">(h)</span><span class="cl">Answer #1 (Rav):</span> "Va'Tikra Esther la'Hasach" - Hasach is Daniel.</p>
<p class="bas indent1"><span class="nm">(i)</span><span class="cl">Question:</span> This is like the opinion that (the name Hasach hints that) Chatchuhu (they cut him from his importance).</p>
<p class="bas indent2"><span class="nm">1.</span>According to the opinion that (it hints that) all royal matters are Nechtachin (decided) by him, how can we answer?</p>
<p class="bas indent1"><span class="nm">(j)</span><span class="cl">Answer #2:</span> He was thrown into a lion's den.</p>
<p class="bas subject"><span class="nm">2)</span>EVERYTHING FOLLOWS THE LOCAL CUSTOM</p>
<p class="bas indent1"><span class="nm">(a)</span><span class="cl">(Mishnah):</span>  Everything is according to the local custom.</p>
<p class="bas indent1"><span class="nm">(b)</span><span class="cl">Question:</span> What does this come to include?</p>
<p class="bas indent1"><span class="nm">(c)</span><span class="cl">Answer:</span> It includes a place where they make walls of Lulav or laurel branches.</p>
<p class="bas indent1"><span class="nm">(d)</span><span class="cl">(Mishnah):</span> Therefore, if the wall falls, the area it occupied and the stones belong to both neighbors.</p>
<p class="bas indent1"><span class="nm">(e)</span><span class="cl">Question:</span> This is obvious!</p>
<p class="bas indent1"><span class="nm">(f)</span><span class="cl">Answer:</span> It must teach about when it fell into the property of one neighbor, or one neighbor took the rocks into his property;</p>
<p class="bas indent2"><span class="nm">1.</span>One might have thought that now he is Muchzak, the other must bring proof to get the rocks. The Mishnah teaches that this is not so.</p>
<p class="bas indent1"><span class="nm">(g)</span><span class="cl">(Mishnah):</span> Similarly, in a garden, in a place where people make a wall, one neighbor can force the other.</p>
<p class="bas indent1"><span class="nm">(h)</span><span class="cl">Inference:</span> Only in a place where people make walls in gardens, one neighbor can force the other. Normally, he cannot force him;</p>
<p class="bas indent1"><span class="nm">(i)</span><span class="cl">Question (Seifa):</span> In a valley, in a place where people don't make a wall, one neighbor cannot force the other.</p>
<p class="bas indent2"><span class="nm">1.</span><span class="cl">Inference:</span> Normally, he can force him!</p>
<p class="bas indent2"><span class="nm">2.</span><span class="cl">Summation of question:</span> If normally, one cannot force his neighbor to build a wall between gardens, all the more so between fields in a valley!</p>
<p class="bas indent1"><span class="nm">(j)</span><span class="cl">Answer (Rava):</span> The Mishnah means that normally, a garden is considered a place where people make a wall, so one neighbor can force the other;</p>
<p class="bas indent2"><span class="nm">1.</span>Normally, a valley is considered a place where people don't make a wall, so one neighbor cannot force the other.</p>
<p class="bas subject"><span class="nm">3)</span>A SIGN PROVING THAT ONE BUILT THE WALL HIMSELF</p>
<p class="bas indent1"><span class="nm">(a)</span><span class="cl">(Mishnah):</span> If he wants to build the wall himself, he builds on his side, and makes a Chazis.</p>
<p class="bas indent1"><span class="nm">(b)</span><span class="cl">Question:</span> What is a Chazis?</p>
<p class="bas indent1"><span class="nm">(c)</span><span class="cl">Version #1 - Answer (Rav Huna):</span> He builds the top of the wall bent towards the neighbor.</p>
<p class="bas indent2"><span class="nm">1.</span><span class="cl">Question:</span> Why doesn't he build it leaning towards himself?</p>
<p class="bas indent2"><span class="nm">2.</span><span class="cl">Answer:</span> Also his neighbor could do so (and people would think that both built the wall).</p>
<p class="bas indent2"><span class="nm">3.</span><span class="cl">Question:</span> Also according to Rav Huna, perhaps the neighbor will cut off the Chazis and claim that he built half!</p>
<p class="bas indent2"><span class="nm">4.</span><span class="cl">Answer:</span> If it is cut, this is recognizable.</p>
<p class="bas indent1"><span class="nm">(d)</span><span class="cl">Version #2 - Answer (Rav Huna):</span> He builds the top of the wall bent towards himself.</p>
<p class="bas indent2"><span class="nm">1.</span><span class="cl">Question:</span> Why doesn't he build it leaning towards his neighbor?</p>
<p class="bas indent2"><span class="nm">2.</span><span class="cl">Answer:</span> His neighbor could cut it (and claim that he helped build the wall).</p>
<p class="bas indent2"><span class="nm">3.</span><span class="cl">Question:</span> Also according to Rav Huna, perhaps the neighbor will make a Chazis and claim that he built half!</p>
<p class="bas indent2"><span class="nm">4.</span><span class="cl">Answer:</span> If he does so (after the wall is already built), this is recognizable.</p>
<p class="bas indent1"><span class="nm">(e)</span><span class="cl">Question:</span> The Mishnah says that he makes a Chazis on the outside!</p>
<p class="bas indent1"><span class="nm">(f)</span>This is left difficult. (end of Version #2)</p>
<p class="bas indent1"><span class="nm">(g)</span><span class="cl">(R. Yochanan):</span> To make a Chazis, one plasters a Tefach of the wall on the outside.</p>
<p class="bas bbbline">4b----------------------------------------4b</p>
<p class="bas indent2"><span class="nm">1.</span><span class="cl">Question:</span> Why doesn't he do so on the inside?</p>
<p class="bas indent2"><span class="nm">2.</span><span class="cl">Answer:</span> Also his neighbor could do so.</p>
<p class="bas indent2"><span class="nm">3.</span><span class="cl">Question:</span> Also according to R. Yochanan, perhaps the neighbor will peel off the Chazis!</p>
<p class="bas indent2"><span class="nm">4.</span><span class="cl">Answer:</span> That would be recognizable.</p>
<p class="bas indent1"><span class="nm">(h)</span><span class="cl">Question:</span> What sign can one make for a wall of Lulav branches?</p>
<p class="bas indent1"><span class="nm">(i)</span><span class="cl">Answer #1 (Rav Nachman):</span> He tilts the branches towards his neighbor.</p>
<p class="bas indent2"><span class="nm">1.</span><span class="cl">Question:</span> Why doesn't he tilt them towards himself?</p>
<p class="bas indent2"><span class="nm">2.</span><span class="cl">Answer:</span> Also his neighbor could do so.</p>
<p class="bas indent2"><span class="nm">3.</span><span class="cl">Question:</span> Also according to Rav Nachman, perhaps the neighbor will cut them!</p>
<p class="bas indent2"><span class="nm">4.</span><span class="cl">Answer:</span> He plasters them.</p>
<p class="bas indent2"><span class="nm">5.</span><span class="cl">Question:</span> The neighbor can peel it off!</p>
<p class="bas indent2"><span class="nm">6.</span><span class="cl">Answer:</span> This would be recognizable.</p>
<p class="bas indent1"><span class="nm">(j)</span><span class="cl">Answer #2 (Abaye):</span> No sign will help. He must write a document saying that he built the wall himself.</p>
<p class="bas indent1"><span class="nm">(k)</span><span class="cl">(Mishnah):</span> If they both build the wall (they build in the middle, and make signs on both sides).</p>
<p class="bas indent1"><span class="nm">(l)</span><span class="cl">Question (Rava of Parzika):</span> Neither should make a sign!</p>
<p class="bas indent1"><span class="nm">(m)</span><span class="cl">Answer (Rav Ashi):</span> The case is, one already made a sign;</p>
<p class="bas indent2"><span class="nm">1.</span>If the other does not also, people will think that his neighbor built it himself.</p>
<p class="bas indent1"><span class="nm">(n)</span><span class="cl">Question (Rava of Parzika):</span> Does the Mishnah teach how to deal with liars?!</p>
<p class="bas indent2"><span class="nm">1.</span><span class="cl">Counter-question: (Rav Ashi):</span> Also the Reisha is an enactment due to liars!</p>
<p class="bas indent2"><span class="nm">2.</span><span class="cl">Answer (Rava of Parzika):</span> The Reisha teaches a law (if one wants to build himself, he builds on his property). Then, it teaches how to prevent the other side from lying;</p>
<p class="bas indent3"><span class="nm">i.</span>The Seifa is no Chidush, that if both build together they build n the middle. Did it come only to teach how to deal with liars?</p>
<p class="bas indent1"><span class="nm">(o)</span><span class="cl">Answer (Ravina):</span> The Chidush of the Seifa is that a Chazis works on a Lulav wall, unlike Abaye.</p>
<p class="bas subject"><span class="nm">4)</span>A FIELD SURROUNDED BY A NEIGHBOR'S FIELDS</p>
<p class="bas indent1"><span class="nm">(a)</span><span class="cl">(Mishnah):</span> If Reuven's field was surrounded by Shimon's field on three sides and Shimon built walls on all three borders, Reuven need not share the cost;</p>
<p class="bas indent1"><span class="nm">(b)</span>R. Yosi says, if he (we shall explain who) fenced the fourth side, Reuven must pay for everything (half of all the walls).</p>
<p class="bas indent1"><span class="nm">(c)</span><span class="cl">(Gemara - Rav Yehudah):</span> The Halachah follows R. Yosi, who says that if he fenced the fourth side, Reuven must pay for everything;</p>
<p class="bas indent2"><span class="nm">1.</span>The law is the same whether Reuven or Shimon built the fourth wall.</p>
<p class="bas indent1"><span class="nm">(d)</span><span class="cl">(Rav Huna):</span> Reuven must pay half the cost of the wall built.</p>
<p class="bas indent1"><span class="nm">(e)</span><span class="cl">(Chiya bar Rav):</span> He pays half the cost of a cheap reed wall.</p>
<p class="bas indent1"><span class="nm">(f)</span><span class="cl">(Mishnah):</span> If Reuven's field was surrounded by Shimon's field on three sides and Shimon built walls on all three borders, Reuven need not share the cost.</p>
<p class="bas indent1"><span class="nm">(g)</span><span class="cl">Inference:</span> If Shimon fenced the fourth side, Reuven must pay.</p>
<p class="bas indent1"><span class="nm">(h)</span><span class="cl">(Seifa - R. Yosi):</span> If he fenced the fourth side, Reuven must pay for everything.</p>
<p class="bas indent1"><span class="nm">(i)</span>According to Rav Huna, we understand the argument (when he fenced the fourth side) - Chachamim (the first Tana) obligate only the cost of a cheap reed wall, R. Yosi obligates half the cost of the wall built.</p>
<p class="bas indent1"><span class="nm">(j)</span><span class="cl">Question:</span> According to Chiya bar Rav, what do they argue about?</p>
<p class="bas indent2"><span class="nm">1.</span>If Chachamim do not obligate the cost of reed walls, what must Reuven pay?</p>
<p class="bas indent1"><span class="nm">(k)</span><span class="cl">Answer #1:</span> The money he saves since he need not guard his field (because it is surrounded by walls).</p>
<p class="bas indent1"><span class="nm">(l)</span><span class="cl">Answer #2:</span> Reuven must share the cost of only the last wall.</p>
<p class="bas indent1"><span class="nm">(m)</span><span class="cl">Answer #3:</span> They argue about Reuven's liability if Shimon builds the fourth wall.</p>
<p class="bas indent2"><span class="nm">1.</span><span class="cl">Version #1:</span> Chachamim hold that if Reuven builds the fourth wall, he must share the cost of all the walls, but if Shimon builds the fourth wall, Reuven only shares the cost of the last wall;</p>
<p class="bas indent2"><span class="nm">2.</span>R. Yosi holds that in either case, he must share the cost of all the walls.</p>
<p class="bas indent2"><span class="nm">3.</span><span class="cl">Version #2:</span> Chachamim hold that even if Shimon builds the fourth wall, Reuven must share the cost;</p>
<p class="bas indent2"><span class="nm">4.</span>R. Yosi holds that if Reuven builds the fourth wall, he must share the cost of all the walls, for he shows that he wants walls around his property;</p>
<p class="bas indent3"><span class="nm">i.</span>But if Shimon builds the fourth wall, Reuven does not pay anything.</p>
