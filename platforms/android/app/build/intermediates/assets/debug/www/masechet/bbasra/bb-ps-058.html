<p class="bas subject"><span class="nm">2)</span>R. BANA'AH</p>
<p class="bas indent1"><span class="nm">(a)</span>R. Bana'ah used to mark off graves. He found Eliezer (Avraham's slave) by Avraham's grave. Eliezer told him that Avraham was sleeping in Sarah's arms.</p>
<p class="bas indent2"><span class="nm">1.</span><span class="cl">R. Bana'ah:</span> Ask Avraham if I may enter.</p>
<p class="bas indent2"><span class="nm">2.</span><span class="cl">Avraham:</span> He may enter. It is known that there is no evil inclination after death, so there is no need for modesty.</p>
<p class="bas indent1"><span class="nm">(b)</span>When R. Bana'ah came to Adam ha'Rishon's grave, a voice from Heaven said: 'you saw (Rashbam - Yakov; R. Chananel - Avraham, who has) the semblance of (Adam, who has) My form. You may not see (Adam, who has) My form itself.'</p>
<p class="bas indent2"><span class="nm">1.</span><span class="cl">R. Bana'ah:</span> I need to mark off the grave (I must see exactly where he is)!</p>
<p class="bas indent2"><span class="nm">2.</span><span class="cl">A voice from Heaven:</span> The inner cave (of the Ma'aras ha'Machpela, in which Adam and Chavah are buried) is the same size as the outer cave (in which the Avos and Imahos are buried, which you saw).</p>
<p class="bas indent3"><span class="nm">i.</span>According to the opinion that one cave is on top of the other, since they are the same size, it suffices to mark off one.</p>
<p class="bas indent1"><span class="nm">(c)</span><span class="cl">R. Bana'ah:</span> I saw the heels of Adam ha'Rishon. They were like the sun;</p>
<p class="bas indent2"><span class="nm">1.</span>Anyone compared to Sarah (regarding beauty) is like a monkey compared to a person (i.e. they are incomparable);</p>

<p class="bas indent2"><span class="nm">2.</span>The radiance of Yakov is a semblance of that of Adam.</p>
<p class="bas indent1"><span class="nm">(e)</span>A witch was digging up corpses. He came to the cave where R. Tuvi bar Masnah was buried. He was holding R. Tuvi by the beard (because he was so beautiful).</p>
<p class="bas indent2"><span class="nm">1.</span><span class="cl">Abaye:</span> Please let go of him.</p>
<p class="bas indent2"><span class="nm">2.</span>The witch complied. The next year, he came again, and grabbed his beard. He did not let go. He brought a scissor and cut his beard.</p>
<p class="bas indent1"><span class="nm">(f)</span>A man was commanding how do divide his property after his death: a barrel of dirt to this son, a barrel of bones to this son, a barrel of feathers to this son. They did not understand what he meant.</p>
<p class="bas indent1"><span class="nm">(g)</span><span class="cl">R. Bana'ah:</span> 'Dirt' refers to his land, 'bones' refers to his animals, and 'feathers' refers to his clothing.</p>
<p class="bas indent1"><span class="nm">(h)</span><span class="cl">A woman chastised her daughter:</span> you should be secretive about illicit Bi'ah! Your (alleged) father has no idea that only one of my 10 children is from him!</p>
<p class="bas indent2"><span class="nm">1.</span>Her husband overheard this. He commanded that all his property be given to one son. No one knew which son he meant.</p>
<p class="bas indent2"><span class="nm">2.</span><span class="cl">R. Bana'ah:</span> You should all bang on his grave until he reveals to you which son he meant.</p>
<p class="bas indent2"><span class="nm">3.</span>All the sons did so, except for one. R. Bana'ah awarded to him all the property. (Surely, he was the true son.)</p>
<p class="bas indent1"><span class="nm">(i)</span>People informed to the king that R. Bana'ah judged without witnesses or due process. They seized him. His wife cried to the judges 'I had a servant. They cut off his head, stripped his skin, ate his flesh, and use his skin to draw water for people to drink, and they did not pay me!'</p>
<p class="bas indent2"><span class="nm">1.</span>They did not understand this; they called R. Bana'ah.</p>
<p class="bas indent2"><span class="nm">2.</span><span class="cl">R. Bana'ah:</span> She refers to her goat.</p>
<p class="bas indent2"><span class="nm">3.</span><span class="cl">His captors:</span> Since you are so smart, you should judge for us!</p>
<p class="bas indent1"><span class="nm">(j)</span>R. Bana'ah saw written by the courthouse 'if someone makes a claim against a judge, he is disqualified from judging.'</p>
<p class="bas indent2"><span class="nm">1.</span><span class="cl">R. Bana'ah:</span> If so, anyone can make a claim against him, and disqualify him!</p>

<p class="bas indent1"><span class="nm">(d)</span><span class="cl">(Gemara) Question:</span> What does it mean 'one does not get a Chazakah for a Marzev, but he gets a Chazakah for its place'?</p>
<p class="bas indent1"><span class="nm">(e)</span><span class="cl">Answer #1 (Rav Yehudah):</span> One does not get a Chazakah to leave it in its position, but he gets a Chazakah to have it at one of the ends of the Mazchilah on this side of the house (from either, the water falls into his neighbor's Chatzer).</p>
<p class="bas indent1"><span class="nm">(f)</span><span class="cl">Answer #2 (R. Chanina):</span> One does not get a Chazakah to leave it as long as it is (if it is longer than necessary, and occupies his neighbor's airspace); his neighbor can force him to shorten it. He gets a Chazakah to leave it in its position.</p>
<p class="bas indent1"><span class="nm">(g)</span><span class="cl">Answer #3 (R. Yirmeyah bar Aba):</span> One does not get a Chazakah to prevent the owner of the Chatzer from building underneath it, but he gets a Chazakah to leave it in its position.</p>
