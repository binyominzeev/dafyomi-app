<p class="bas subject"><span class="nm">1)</span>WAYS OF CARING FOR AND WEARING CLOTHING ON SHABBOS</p>
<p class="bas indent1"><span class="nm">(a)</span><span class="cl">(Rav Huna):</span> If one shook out [Rashi - the dirt from; Tosfos - dew from] his Talis on Shabbos, he is Chayav Chatas [for laundering].</p>
<p class="bas indent2"><span class="nm">1.</span>This is only if it is new - if it is old, it is permitted;</p>
<p class="bas indent2"><span class="nm">2.</span>[Even if it is new,] this is only if it is black - if it is white or red, it is permitted;</p>
<p class="bas indent2"><span class="nm">3.</span>[Even if it is black,] this is only if he is insistent [not to wear it without shaking it out] - if he is not insistent, it is permitted.</p>
<p class="bas indent1"><span class="nm">(b)</span>Ula came to Pumbadisa and saw Rabanan shaking out their garments - he said, 'They are Mechalel Shabbos!'</p>
<p class="bas indent1"><span class="nm">(c)</span><span class="cl">Rav Yehudah:</span> You may shake out right in front of him - we are not insistent.</p>
<p class="bas indent1"><span class="nm">(d)</span>Rav Yosef asked [his Talmid] Abaye to bring his hat; Abaye saw dew on it, and was hesitant.</p>
<p class="bas indent1"><span class="nm">(e)</span><span class="cl">Rav Yosef:</span> Shake it out - we are not insistent!</p>
<p class="bas indent1"><span class="nm">(f)</span><span class="cl">(R. Yitzchak bar Yosef):</span> If one walks in Reshus ha'Rabim on Shabbos with his garment folded onto his shoulder (this is not the way to wear it, it is a load), he is Chayav Chatas.</p>
<p class="bas indent1"><span class="nm">(g)</span><span class="cl">Support (Beraisa):</span> If a clothes salesman walks in Reshus ha'Rabim on Shabbos with a garment folded onto his shoulder, he is Chayav Chatas;</p>
<p class="bas indent2"><span class="nm">1.</span>The same applies to anyone, just clothes salesmen normally go like this.</p>
<p class="bas indent1"><span class="nm">(h)</span>If a grocer walks in Reshus ha'Rabim on Shabbos with money in his cloak, he is Chayav Chatas;</p>
<p class="bas indent2"><span class="nm">1.</span>The same applies to anyone, just grocers normally go like this.</p>
<p class="bas indent1"><span class="nm">(i)</span>Couriers (Aruch; Rashi - people of a certain place) may go out with turbans folded on their shoulders;</p>
<p class="bas indent2"><span class="nm">1.</span>The same applies to anyone, just it is normal for these people to go like this.</p>
<p class="bas indent1"><span class="nm">(j)</span><span class="cl">R. Yehudah:</span> A case occurred, Hurkenus the son of R. Eliezer went out with a turban folded on his shoulder - a thread from it was wrapped on his finger [to ensure that it not fall];</p>
<p class="bas indent2"><span class="nm">1.</span>Chachamim said, it is permitted even without a thread wrapped on his finger.</p>
<p class="bas indent1"><span class="nm">(k)</span><span class="cl">(Rav Nachman bar Rav Chisda):</span> The Halachah is, it is permitted even without a thread wrapped on his finger.</p>
<p class="bas indent1"><span class="nm">(l)</span><span class="cl">Question (Bei Rav Asi bar Hini):</span> May one make Marzev on Shabbos (this will be explained)?</p>
<p class="bas indent1"><span class="nm">(m)</span><span class="cl">Answer (Ula):</span> R. Ilai forbids.</p>
<p class="bas indent1"><span class="nm">(n)</span><span class="cl">Question:</span> What is Marzev?</p>
<p class="bas indent1"><span class="nm">(o)</span><span class="cl">Answer (R. Zeira):</span> People of Bavel make folds (Rashi - and support them with threads) in garments that are too long. (It is forbidden, for it is like fixing the garment.)</p>
<p class="bas indent2"><span class="nm">1.</span>R. Yirmiyah demonstrated and asked about different ways of doing this; R. Zeira forbade all of them.</p>
<p class="bas indent1"><span class="nm">(p)</span><span class="cl">(Rav Papa):</span> The general rule is - if it is meant to stay folded permanently, it is forbidden;</p>
<p class="bas indent2"><span class="nm">1.</span>If it is temporary, it is permitted, like Rav Shisha brei d'Rav Idi straightens out his cloak [on a weekday].</p>
<p class="bas indent1"><span class="nm">(q)</span><span class="cl">(Rav Dimi):</span> Once, Rebbi entered a field, the two sides of his Talis were on his shoulders;</p>
<p class="bas indent2"><span class="nm">1.</span><span class="cl">Yehoshua ben Ziruz (the brother-in-law of R. Meir):</span> R. Meir was Mechayev Chatas for this (it is like a load)!</p>
<p class="bas indent2"><span class="nm">2.</span><span class="cl">Rebbi:</span> Is he Mechayev for this? (Only the sides are on the shoulders, the rest hangs down!)</p>
<p class="bas indent2"><span class="nm">3.</span>Rebbi lowered his Talis (he accepted Yehoshua's words).</p>
<p class="bas indent1"><span class="nm">(r)</span><span class="cl">(Ravin):</span> No, Yehoshua ben Kefusai, the son-in-law of R. Akiva told Rebbi that R. Akiva is Mechayev Chatas for this; Rebbi was surprised, but accepted his words.</p>
<p class="bas indent1"><span class="nm">(s)</span><span class="cl">Rav Shmuel bar Rav Yehudah:</span> Rebbi was not wearing a Talis this way - rather, he was asked, and was about to permit until he heard that R. Meir or R. Akiva is Mechayev.</p>
<p class="bas subject"><span class="nm">2)</span>LAWS RELATED TO BATHING ON SHABBOS</p>
<p class="bas indent1"><span class="nm">(a)</span><span class="cl">(Mishnah):</span> If one bathed in a cave or in the springs of Tiverya and wiped himself, even if he used 10 towels, he may not take them [with him, even if there is an Eiruv, lest he squeeze them];</p>
<p class="bas indent1"><span class="nm">(b)</span>However, even 10 people may use the same towel to wipe their hands, feet and face (or even their whole bodies, just this is uncommon, for it would be too wet), and take the towel.</p>
<p class="bas indent1"><span class="nm">(c)</span>We may anoint and massage [for pleasure], but one may not rub hard or scratch himself with Magredes (a comb used for horses, for this is a weekday act).</p>
<p class="bas indent1"><span class="nm">(d)</span>One may not descend to Kordima (a certain river) or make Afiktizin [to make himself vomit];</p>
<p class="bas indent1"><span class="nm">(e)</span>One may not straighten limbs or vertebrae of a baby, or reset a broken bone;</p>
<p class="bas indent1"><span class="nm">(f)</span>If the hand or leg bone was dislocated, he may not shake (alternatively - rub, or shower) it in water, but he may wash normally; if it heals, this is no problem.</p>
<p class="bas indent1"><span class="nm">(g)</span><span class="cl">(Gemara):</span> The Mishnah discusses a cave and springs of Tiverya to equate them - just like the springs are hot, also the cave water;</p>
<p class="bas indent2"><span class="nm">1.</span>'If one bathed' connotes b'Diavad - but to shower is l'Chatchilah!</p>
<p class="bas bbbline">147b----------------------------------------147b</p>
<p class="bas indent1"><span class="nm">(h)</span><span class="cl">Question:</span> Who is the Tana of the Mishnah?</p>
<p class="bas indent1"><span class="nm">(i)</span><span class="cl">Answer:</span> It is R. Shimon:</p>
<p class="bas indent2"><span class="nm">1.</span><span class="cl">(Beraisa - R. Meir):</span> [On Shabbos] one may not shower his entire body in hot or cold water;</p>
<p class="bas indent2"><span class="nm">2.</span>R. Shimon permits;</p>
<p class="bas indent2"><span class="nm">3.</span>R. Yehudah forbids in hot water, he permits in cold water.</p>
<p class="bas indent1"><span class="nm">(j)</span><span class="cl">(Mishnah):</span> And wiped himself, even if he used 10 towels...</p>
<p class="bas indent1"><span class="nm">(k)</span>The Reisha and Seifa each teach a Chidush:</p>
<p class="bas indent2"><span class="nm">1.</span>The Reisha teaches, even though each towel is barely wet, since only one person wiped himself, he may not take them back lest he [forget, and] squeeze them;</p>
<p class="bas indent2"><span class="nm">2.</span>The Seifa teaches, even though the towel is very wet, since there are many people, they may take it back - they will remind each other not to squeeze it.</p>
<p class="bas indent1"><span class="nm">(l)</span><span class="cl">(Beraisa):</span> One may wipe himself with a towel and leave it in the window; he may not give it to a bathhouse attendant, for they are suspected of this matter (squeezing them, to give to another bather).</p>
<p class="bas indent1"><span class="nm">(m)</span>R. Shimon says, one may wipe himself with one towel and take it back home.</p>
<p class="bas indent1"><span class="nm">(n)</span><span class="cl">Question (Abaye):</span> What is the Halachah?</p>
<p class="bas indent1"><span class="nm">(o)</span><span class="cl">Answer (Rav Yosef):</span> R. Shimon permits [here], and also Rebbi, Shmuel, and R. Yochanan:</p>
<p class="bas indent2"><span class="nm">1.</span><span class="cl">(Beraisa - Rebbi):</span> When we learned from R. Shimon in Tako'a, we would bring to him [on Shabbos] oil and a towel, transferring them from Chatzer to roof, from roof to Karfef, from Karfef to Karfef, until we reached the bathing spring. (Presumably, they returned the towel and did not leave it Hefker. Tosfos - a Talmid may not bathe with his Rebbi, unless the Rebbi needs him - presumably, one Talmid sufficed, and he would return the towel himself, for R. Shimon permits this.)</p>
<p class="bas indent2"><span class="nm">2.</span><span class="cl">(Shmuel):</span> One may wipe himself with a towel and take it back home.</p>
<p class="bas indent2"><span class="nm">3.</span><span class="cl">(R. Chiya bar Aba citing R. Yochanan):</span> One may wipe himself with a towel and take it back home.</p>
<p class="bas indent2"><span class="nm">4.</span><span class="cl">Question:</span> But R. Yochanan said that the Halachah follows an anonymous Mishnah - and our Mishnah says, even if he used 10 towels, he may not take them back!</p>
<p class="bas indent2"><span class="nm">5.</span><span class="cl">Answer:</span> [He holds that it is not a Stam Mishnah -] his text says 'these are the words of Ben Chachinai':</p>
<p class="bas indent1"><span class="nm">(p)</span><span class="cl">(R. Chiya bar Aba):</span> A bathhouse attendant may bring towels for women to the bathhouse [through Reshus ha'Rabim, by wearing them], on condition that he covers the majority of his head and body with it.</p>
<p class="bas indent1"><span class="nm">(q)</span>To wear Sachnisa (a large (Rashi; Rambam - small) turban; Tosfos - a very thin garment) in Reshus ha'Rabim, one must tie the ends at the bottom (lest it fall down or blow off).</p>
<p class="bas indent1"><span class="nm">(r)</span><span class="cl">(R. Chiya bar Aba):</span> One must tie it below the shoulders.</p>
<p class="bas indent1"><span class="nm">(s)</span><span class="cl">Rava (to the people of his city):</span> When [Nochri] soldiers force you to take their clothes to the bathhouse [on Shabbos], let them down from your shoulders [so it will be the way of wearing them].</p>
<p class="bas subject"><span class="nm">3)</span>RUBBING AND SCRATCHING ON SHABBOS</p>
<p class="bas indent1"><span class="nm">(a)</span><span class="cl">(Mishnah):</span> We may anoint and massage.</p>
<p class="bas indent1"><span class="nm">(b)</span><span class="cl">(Beraisa):</span> We may anoint and massage the intestines, on Shabbos, as long as it is unlike one does on a weekday.</p>
<p class="bas indent1"><span class="nm">(c)</span><span class="cl">Question:</span> How does one deviate?</p>
<p class="bas indent1"><span class="nm">(d)</span><span class="cl">Answer #1 (Rav Chama bar Chanina):</span> He anoints before massaging.</p>
<p class="bas indent1"><span class="nm">(e)</span><span class="cl">Answer #2 (R. Yochanan):</span> He anoints and massages at the same time.</p>
<p class="bas indent1"><span class="nm">(f)</span><span class="cl">(Mishnah):</span> But one may not rub hard.</p>
<p class="bas indent1"><span class="nm">(g)</span><span class="cl">(R. Chiya bar Aba):</span> It is forbidden to stand on the floor of the Deyumeses river (it is salty), for this heats a person and cures.</p>
<p class="bas indent1"><span class="nm">(h)</span><span class="cl">(Rav Yehudah):</span> There are 21 days during which it heals, including Shavu'os.</p>
<p class="bas indent1"><span class="nm">(i)</span><span class="cl">Question:</span> Is Shavu'os the first or last day?</p>
<p class="bas indent1"><span class="nm">(j)</span><span class="cl">Answer:</span> Shmuel taught that anything drunk for a cure works from Pesach until Shavu'os. (Here also, Shavu'os is the last day it helps!)</p>
<p class="bas indent1"><span class="nm">(k)</span><span class="cl">Rejection:</span> Perhaps drinks help when the world is cold, but this works on account of heat, it is better after Shavu'os!</p>
<p class="bas indent1"><span class="nm">(l)</span><span class="cl">(R. Chelbo):</span> [Superb] wine of Prugaisa (a place) and water of the Deyumeses severed the 10 Shevatim from Yisrael (they pursued these pleasures and neglected learning);</p>
<p class="bas indent1"><span class="nm">(m)</span>R. Elazar ben Arach went there - he was drawn after them, and forgot his learning.</p>
<p class="bas indent2"><span class="nm">1.</span>When he returned, he tried to resume learning; he wanted to read "Ha'Chodesh ha'Zeh Lachem..." - the words came out 'Ha'Cheres Hayah Libam' (Ya'avetz - to hint to him that these pleasures made the 10 Shevatim lose Yir'as Shomayim, and their hearts became hard like earthenware. Formerly, his heart was a 'gushing spring', he outweighed all other Chachamim [regarding his power of reasoning - Avos 2:8]);</p>
<p class="bas indent2"><span class="nm">2.</span>Rabanan prayed for him, he recovered his learning.</p>
<p class="bas indent2"><span class="nm">3.</span><span class="cl">(Mishnah - R. Nehurai):</span> Exile yourself to a place of Torah (go to where Chachamim are, do not say that they are Talmidim, so they should follow you); do not say that Torah will follow you - rather, your colleagues will cause you to retain it (when you learn one tractate, they learn others, this helps you to remember them); and do not rely on your understanding (even if you are very sharp, you will retain your learning only if you learn with others).</p>
<p class="bas indent2"><span class="nm">4.</span><span class="cl">(Beraisa):</span> R. Nehurai's real name was R. Nechemyah;</p>
<p class="bas indent2"><span class="nm">5.</span>Some say, he was R. Elazar ben Arach;</p>
<p class="bas indent2"><span class="nm">6.</span>He is called R. Nehurai because he was Manhir (enlightened) Chachamim's eyes in Halachah.</p>
<p class="bas indent1"><span class="nm">(n)</span><span class="cl">(Mishnah):</span> One may not scratch himself.</p>
<p class="bas indent1"><span class="nm">(o)</span><span class="cl">(Beraisa):</span> One may not scratch himself with Magredes on Shabbos;</p>
<p class="bas indent1"><span class="nm">(p)</span>R. Shimon ben Gamliel says, if his feet were dirty with mud and excrement, he may scrape them normally.</p>
<p class="bas indent1"><span class="nm">(q)</span>Rav Shmuel bar Yehudah's mother made a silver Magredes for him [for Shabbos, so it should be unlike a weekday act].</p>
<p class="bas indent1"><span class="nm">(r)</span><span class="cl">(Mishnah):</span> One may not descend to Kordima.</p>
<p class="bas indent1"><span class="nm">(s)</span>This is because the mud there is slippery; he is prone to fall in, and might come to squeeze his garments.</p>
<p class="bas subject"><span class="nm">4)</span>THINGS FORBIDDEN ON ACCOUNT OF HEALING ON SHABBOS</p>
<p class="bas indent1"><span class="nm">(a)</span><span class="cl">(Mishnah):</span> One may not make Afiktizin.</p>
<p class="bas indent1"><span class="nm">(b)</span><span class="cl">(Rabah bar bar Chanah):</span> It is forbidden to induce vomiting through a potion, but by hand (sticking it down the throat) is permitted.</p>
<p class="bas indent1"><span class="nm">(c)</span><span class="cl">(Beraisa - R. Nechemyah):</span> It is forbidden [to induce vomiting in order to eat more] even on a weekday, for this wastes food.</p>
<p class="bas indent1"><span class="nm">(d)</span><span class="cl">(Mishnah):</span> One may not straighten limbs or vertebrae of a baby.</p>
<p class="bas indent1"><span class="nm">(e)</span><span class="cl">(Rabah bar bar Chanah):</span> One may wrap limbs of a baby (to straighten them, so they will not get bent).</p>
<p class="bas indent1"><span class="nm">(f)</span><span class="cl">Question:</span> The Mishnah forbids this!</p>
<p class="bas indent1"><span class="nm">(g)</span><span class="cl">Answer:</span> The Mishnah forbids straightening a vertebra that fell out of line [after the day of birth], for it is like building.</p>
