<p class="bas subject"><span class="nm">1)</span>PARSHAS SHEKALIM</p>
<p class="bas indent1"><span class="nm">(a)</span><span class="cl">(R. Yitzchak Nafcha):</span> If the weekly portion of Parshas Shekalim is Tetzaveh, six read Tetzaveh, and the last reads "Ki Sisa".</p>
<p class="bas indent1"><span class="nm">(b)</span><span class="cl">Objection (Abaye):</span> If so, people will not realize that a special Parshah was read. They will think that this is where the Parshah finished (since Ki Sisa follows Tetzaveh)! Rather, six read the normal Parshah and Ki Sisa; and the seventh repeats Ki Sisa.</p>
<p class="bas indent1"><span class="nm">(c)</span><span class="cl">Question (Beraisa):</span> If Rosh Chodesh Adar is in the week before or after (we normally read) Parshas Shekalim, we read it and repeat it.</p>
<p class="bas indent2"><span class="nm">1.</span>This is like Abaye, who says that the seventh repeats Ki Sisa. It is unlike R. Yitzchak Nafcha.</p>
<p class="bas indent2"><span class="nm">2.</span><span class="cl">Counter-question:</span> When Parshas Shekalim was the previous Shabbos, why should we read it twice this Shabbos?</p>
<p class="bas indent2"><span class="nm">3.</span><span class="cl">Answer:</span> Abaye must say that 'we repeat it' means that it is repeated the next Shabbos.</p>
<p class="bas indent1"><span class="nm">(d)</span><span class="cl">Answer:</span> R. Yitzchak Nafcha gives the same answer.</p>
<p class="bas indent1"><span class="nm">(e)</span><span class="cl">(R. Yitzchak Nafcha):</span> If the weekly portion of is Ki Sisa, six read from the end of Parshas Shekalim until the end of Ki Sisa, and the seventh reads Parshas Shekalim.</p>
<p class="bas indent1"><span class="nm">(f)</span><span class="cl">Objection (Abaye):</span> People will say that he is reading retroactively! Rather, six read Ki Sisa entirely, and the seventh repeats Parshas Shekalim.</p>
<p class="bas indent1"><span class="nm">(g)</span><span class="cl">Support (Beraisa):</span> If Parshas Shekalim is the Shabbos we normally read Parshas Shekalim, we read it and repeat it.</p>
<p class="bas indent1"><span class="nm">(h)</span><span class="cl">(Rav):</span> If Rosh Chodesh Adar falls on Friday, we read Parshas Shekalim the previous Shabbos;</p>
<p class="bas indent1"><span class="nm">(i)</span><span class="cl">(Shmuel):</span> We read it the next day.</p>
<p class="bas indent1"><span class="nm">(j)</span>Rav says we read early, so there will be two weeks before the tables are set up;</p>
<p class="bas indent1"><span class="nm">(k)</span>Shmuel says that since the 15th will fall on Friday, the tables are not set up until Sunday the 17th. Therefore, we can read on the second, and this is two weeks beforehand.</p>
<p class="bas indent1"><span class="nm">(l)</span><span class="cl">Question (Mishnah):</span> If Rosh Chodesh Adar falls during the week, we read Parshas Shekalim the previous Shabbos, and the next Shabbos there is no special Parshah.</p>
<p class="bas indent2"><span class="nm">1.</span><span class="cl">Suggestion:</span> Even falling on Friday counts as during the week!</p>
<p class="bas indent1"><span class="nm">(m)</span><span class="cl">Answer:</span> No, it refers to properly (earlier) in the week (when the coming Shabbos is less than two weeks before the tables).</p>
<p class="bas indent1"><span class="nm">(n)</span><span class="cl">Question (Beraisa):</span> The first Shabbos (of the Parshiyos) is whichever Rosh Chodesh Adar falls b'Sochah (in it), even Friday.</p>
<p class="bas indent2"><span class="nm">1.</span><span class="cl">Suggestion:</span> The Halachah when it is Friday is the same as when it is during the week, we read the Shabbos before!</p>
<p class="bas indent1"><span class="nm">(o)</span><span class="cl">Answer:</span> No, Friday is the same as when it is <i>Bah</i> (on Shabbos, we do not read before it).</p>
<p class="bas indent2"><span class="nm">1.</span>Tana d'Vei Shmuel taught a Beraisa which explicitly says Bah.</p>
<p class="bas indent1"><span class="nm">(p)</span>Tana'im argue like Rav and Shmuel:</p>
<p class="bas indent2"><span class="nm">1.</span><span class="cl">(Beraisa - Rebbi):</span> We skip a Shabbos (after the first Parshah, before reading Parshas Zachor);</p>
<p class="bas indent2"><span class="nm">2.</span>R. Shimon ben Elazar says, we do not skip, i.e. when Rosh Chodesh Adar falls on Friday. When it falls during the week, we read the previous Shabbos, even though it is Shevat.</p>
<p class="bas subject"><span class="nm">2)</span>WHEN WE READ THE FOUR <i>PARSHIYOS</i></p>
<p class="bas indent1"><span class="nm">(a)</span><span class="cl">(Rav):</span> When Purim falls on Friday, we read Parshas Zachor the previous Shabbos;</p>
<p class="bas indent1"><span class="nm">(b)</span><span class="cl">(Shmuel):</span> We read it the following day.</p>
<p class="bas indent2"><span class="nm">1.</span>Rav says that we read early, because the Zechirah (remembrance) should precede the Asiyah (the meal and Yom Tov).</p>
<p class="bas indent2"><span class="nm">2.</span>Shmuel says that since walled cities celebrate the 15th (the next day), this is considered Zechirah and Asiyah coming together.</p>
<p class="bas indent1"><span class="nm">(c)</span><span class="cl">Question (Mishnah):</span> (If Rosh Chodesh is on Shabbos,) we read Parshas Zachor the second (Shabbos).</p>
<p class="bas indent2"><span class="nm">1.</span>When Rosh Chodesh is Shabbos, Purim (the 14th) is on Friday!</p>
<p class="bas indent1"><span class="nm">(d)</span><span class="cl">Answer (Rav Papa):</span> (This refers to the Seifa, when Rosh Chodesh is during the week.) It means the second Shabbos from the Shabbos we skipped. (Ritva - we could have asked why the Mishnah says that we read Parah on the third Shabbos, and we would have to answer even according to Rav that it means the third Shabbos from the Shabbos we skipped.)</p>
<p class="bas indent1"><span class="nm">(e)</span><span class="cl">Question (Beraisa):</span> The second Shabbos (of a special Parshah) is whichever Purim falls b'Sochah (in it), even Friday.</p>
<p class="bas indent2"><span class="nm">1.</span>Whether Purim is in the week or on Friday, we read Zachor the Shabbos before!</p>
<p class="bas indent1"><span class="nm">(f)</span><span class="cl">Answer:</span> No, Friday is the same as when it is <i>Bah</i> (on Shabbos, we do not read before it).</p>
<p class="bas indent2"><span class="nm">1.</span>Tana d'Vei Shmuel taught a Beraisa which explicitly says Bah.</p>
<p class="bas indent1"><span class="nm">(g)</span><span class="cl">(Rav Huna):</span> If Purim falls on Shabbos, all agree that we read on Purim;</p>
<p class="bas indent1"><span class="nm">(h)</span><span class="cl">(Rav Nachman):</span> Rav would argue even then (and say that we read the previous Shabbos).</p>
<p class="bas indent2"><span class="nm">1.</span><span class="cl">(R. Chiya bar Aba):</span> Rav said so explicitly.</p>
<p class="bas indent1"><span class="nm">(i)</span><span class="cl">(Mishnah):</span> The third (special Parshah) is Parah Adumah.</p>
<p class="bas indent1"><span class="nm">(j)</span><span class="cl">(Beraisa):</span> The third Shabbos (with a special Parshah) is the Shabbos after Purim.</p>
<p class="bas indent1"><span class="nm">(k)</span><span class="cl">(R. Chama b'R. Chanina):</span> It is the Shabbos before Rosh Chodesh Nisan.</p>
<p class="bas indent1"><span class="nm">(l)</span>They do not argue. R. Chama discusses when Rosh Chodesh Nisan is on Shabbos (we read Parshas ha'Chodesh that same day, and Parah the previous Shabbos), and the Beraisa discusses when Rosh Chodesh is any other day.</p>
<p class="bas indent1"><span class="nm">(m)</span><span class="cl">(Mishnah):</span> The fourth Shabbos we read "ha'Chodesh ha'Zeh Lachem".</p>
<p class="bas indent1"><span class="nm">(n)</span><span class="cl">(Beraisa):</span> When Rosh Chodesh Adar falls on Shabbos, we read Ki Sisa, and Yehoyada ha'Kohen is the Haftorah.</p>
<p class="bas indent1"><span class="nm">(o)</span>The first Shabbos is the one that Rosh Chodesh Adar falls in, even if it falls on Friday.</p>
<p class="bas indent2"><span class="nm">1.</span>On the second Shabbos, we read Parshas Zachor and the Haftorah is "Pokadti". The second Shabbos is the one that Purim falls in, even if it falls on Friday.</p>
<p class="bas indent2"><span class="nm">2.</span>The third Shabbos we read Parshas Parah Adumah. The Haftorah is "V'Zarakti Aleichem". The third Shabbos is the one after Purim.</p>
<p class="bas indent2"><span class="nm">3.</span>The fourth Shabbos we read "ha'Chodesh ha'Zeh", and the Haftorah is "Ko Amar Hash-m."</p>

<p class="bas indent2"><span class="nm">4.</span>The fourth Shabbos is the one that Rosh Chodesh Nisan falls in, even if it falls on Friday.</p>
<p class="bas subject"><span class="nm">3)</span>OTHER SPECIAL READINGS</p>
<p class="bas indent1"><span class="nm">(a)</span><span class="cl">(Mishnah):</span> We return to the normal order on the fifth Shabbos.</p>
<p class="bas indent1"><span class="nm">(b)</span><span class="cl">(R. Ami):</span> We return to the normal order of Torah portions (during the four Parshiyos we skipped reading the normal weekly Parshah).</p>
<p class="bas indent1"><span class="nm">(c)</span><span class="cl">(R. Yirmeyah):</span> We return to the normal order of Haftoros.</p>
<p class="bas indent1"><span class="nm">(d)</span><span class="cl">Support (for R. Ami - Abaye - Mishnah):</span> We interrupt...  for Ta'aneisim and Ma'amados...</p>
<p class="bas indent2"><span class="nm">1.</span>These are on weekdays, on which we normally read from the Torah (on Mondays and Thursdays), but there is no regular Haftorah!</p>
<p class="bas indent1"><span class="nm">(e)</span><span class="cl">Rejection:</span> R. Yirmeyah explains that regarding those, we return to the Torah portion.</p>
<p class="bas indent1"><span class="nm">(f)</span><span class="cl">Question:</span> Why do we interrupt on Ta'aneisim? We should read the normal Parshah in the morning, and the Parshah for Ta'aneisim in the afternoon!</p>
<p class="bas indent1"><span class="nm">(g)</span><span class="cl">Answer:</span> This supports Rav Huna, who said that we congregate in the morning on Ta'aneisim  (so there is no time to read the Torah).</p>
<p class="bas indent2"><span class="nm">1.</span><span class="cl">(Abaye):</span> Until midday, we investigate the matters of the city. The third quarter of the day we read the Torah and Haftorah. The last quarter, we request mercy. We learn from "Va'Yikre'u ba'Sefer Toras Hash-m Elokeihem Revi'is ha'Yom u'Revi'is Misvadim u'Mishtachavim."</p>
<p class="bas indent1"><span class="nm">(h)</span><span class="cl">Question:</span> Perhaps we read and pray in the first half of the day, and in second half we congregate!</p>
<p class="bas indent1"><span class="nm">(i)</span><span class="cl">Answer:</span> It says "At the end of the day ... (I spread my hands to Hash-m)".</p>
<p class="bas indent1"><span class="nm">(j)</span><span class="cl">(Mishnah):</span> We read the following Parshiyos at the following times:</p>
<p class="bas indent2"><span class="nm">1.</span>On (the first day of) Pesach, Parshas Mo'adim in Vayikra; on Shavu'os, "Sheva Shavu'os"; on Rosh Hashanah, "Ba'Chodesh ha'Shevi'i"; on Yom Kipur, "Acharei Mos"; on the first day of Sukos, Parshas Mo'adim in Vayikra; on the other days of Sukos, the Korbanos of Sukos; on Chanukah, Chanukas ha'Mishkan; on Purim, "Va'Yavo Amalek"; on Rosh Chodesh, "b'Roshei Chodsheichem"; on Ma'amados, Ma'ase Bereishis; on Ta'aneisim, Berachos and Klalos.</p>
