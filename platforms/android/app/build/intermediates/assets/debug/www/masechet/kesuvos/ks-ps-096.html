<p class="bas subject"><span class="nm">1)</span>A WIDOW'S EARNINGS (cont.)</p>
<p class="bas indent1"><span class="nm">(a)</span><span class="cl">Answer:</span> Shmuel taught that a widow keeps Metzi'os that she finds.</p>
<p class="bas indent2"><span class="nm">1.</span>We understand this if the text of the Mishnah is 'a widow who is fed' (Shmuel discusses a widow who is not fed).</p>
<p class="bas indent2"><span class="nm">2.</span>But if the text is 'a widow is fed', the orphans are like the husband. Just like a husband gets his wife's Metzi'os, also they should get them!</p>
<p class="bas indent1"><span class="nm">(b)</span><span class="cl">Rejection:</span> Really, the text can be 'is fed.' Chachamim enacted that a husband gets her Metzi'os to avoid enmity. We are not concerned for this regarding the orphans.</p>
<p class="bas indent1"><span class="nm">(c)</span><span class="cl">(R. Yosi bar Chanina):</span> A widow does for the heirs all tasks that a wife does for her husband, except for mixing drinks, spreading the bed, and washing the hands, feet and face.</p>
<p class="bas indent1"><span class="nm">(d)</span><span class="cl">(R. Yehoshua ben Levi):</span> A Talmid does for his Rebbi all tasks that a slave does for his master, except for untying his shoe (lest people think that the Talmid is a slave).</p>
<p class="bas indent1"><span class="nm">(e)</span><span class="cl">(Rava):</span> This is only in a place where people do not recognize him. Where people recognize him, it is no problem (to untie his shoe).</p>
<p class="bas indent1"><span class="nm">(f)</span><span class="cl">(Rav Ashi):</span> Even where people do not recognize him, it is only a problem if the Talmid is not wearing Tefilin (slaves do not wear Tefilin).</p>
<p class="bas indent1"><span class="nm">(g)</span><span class="cl">(R. Chiya bar Avin):</span> Anyone who prevents his Talmid from serving him withholds from him Chesed - "He withholds Chesed from his friend"</p>
<p class="bas indent2"><span class="nm">1.</span><span class="cl">(Rav Nachman bar Yitzchak):</span> He removes fear of Shamayim from him - "he (causes that he) abandons fear of Hash-m".</p>
<p class="bas subject"><span class="nm">2)</span>A WIDOW'S RIGHT TO BE FED</p>
<p class="bas indent1"><span class="nm">(a)</span><span class="cl">(R. Elazar, and also a Beraisa):</span> If a widow seized Metaltelim to pay for her food, she keeps them.</p>
<p class="bas indent1"><span class="nm">(b)</span><span class="cl">(Rav Dimi):</span> A case occurred in which R. Shabtai's daughter-in-law seized a sack of coins, and Chachamim could not take it from her.</p>
<p class="bas indent1"><span class="nm">(c)</span><span class="cl">(Ravina):</span> This applies only to food. If she seized Metaltelim to collect her Kesuvah, we take them from her.</p>
<p class="bas indent1"><span class="nm">(d)</span><span class="cl">Objection (Mar bar Rav Ashi):</span> Surely, when she seized for her Kesuvah we take from her because a Kesuvah is collected only from land, not from Metaltelim;</p>
<p class="bas indent2"><span class="nm">1.</span>Also food may be collected only from land!</p>
<p class="bas indent2"><span class="nm">2.</span>Rather when she seizes for food, she keeps it. The same applies when she seizes for her Kesuvah.</p>
<p class="bas indent1"><span class="nm">(e)</span><span class="cl">(R. Yitzchak bar Naftali):</span> Rava taught like Ravina.</p>
<p class="bas indent1"><span class="nm">(f)</span><span class="cl">(R. Yochanan):</span> If a widow did not claim food for two or three years, she lost rights to food.</p>
<p class="bas indent1"><span class="nm">(g)</span><span class="cl">Question:</span> If she loses after two years, why does he mention three years?</p>
<p class="bas indent1"><span class="nm">(h)</span><span class="cl">Answer #1:</span> A poor woman loses after two, and a rich woman after three.</p>
<p class="bas indent1"><span class="nm">(i)</span><span class="cl">Answer #2:</span> An immodest woman loses after two, and a modest woman after three.</p>
<p class="bas indent1"><span class="nm">(j)</span><span class="cl">(Rava):</span> She loses only for the past (for when she did not claim), but she is entitled to receive food in the future.</p>
<p class="bas indent1"><span class="nm">(k)</span><span class="cl">Question (R. Yochanan):</span> If the orphans say that they fed her and she says that she did not receive, who must bring a proof?</p>
<p class="bas bbbline">96b----------------------------------------96b</p>
<p class="bas indent2"><span class="nm">1.</span>Do we consider the property to be in the possession of the orphans, and she must bring a proof?</p>
<p class="bas indent2"><span class="nm">2.</span>Or, is the property Muchzak by her, and the orphans must bring a proof?</p>
<p class="bas indent1"><span class="nm">(l)</span><span class="cl">Answer #1:</span> Levi taught that as long as a widow did not remarry, the orphans must bring proof that she collected. After she married, she must bring proof.</p>
<p class="bas indent1"><span class="nm">(m)</span><span class="cl">Answer #2 (Rav Simi bar Ashi):</span> Tana'im argue about who is Muchzak in the property:</p>
<p class="bas indent2"><span class="nm">1.</span><span class="cl">(Beraisa - R. Yehudah):</span> She sells and writes 'this was sold for food, and this was sold for payment of the Kesuvah';</p>
<p class="bas indent2"><span class="nm">2.</span>R. Yosi says, she does not specify for what she sold. This gives to her greater power of collection.</p>
<p class="bas indent2"><span class="nm">3.</span><span class="cl">Suggestion:</span> R. Yehudah requires her to specify because he holds that the orphans are Muchzakim, and she must bring proof. R. Yosi does not require her to specify, since he holds that she is Muchzekes, and the orphans must bring proof.</p>
<p class="bas indent1"><span class="nm">(n)</span><span class="cl">Rejection #1:</span> Perhaps all agree that she is Muchzekes, and the orphans must bring proof;</p>
<p class="bas indent2"><span class="nm">1.</span>R. Yehudah merely counsels her to write that some property was sold for the Kesuvah, so people will not think that she eats a lot.</p>
<p class="bas indent1"><span class="nm">(o)</span><span class="cl">Support:</span> This must be correct. If not, R. Yochanan would have settled his question from a Mishnah!</p>
<p class="bas indent2"><span class="nm">1.</span><span class="cl">(Mishnah):</span> She may sell for food outside of Beis Din, and she writes 'I sold this for food.'</p>
<p class="bas indent2"><span class="nm">2.</span>Rather, we must say that there is no proof from the Mishnah, for perhaps it is merely good counsel.</p>
<p class="bas indent2"><span class="nm">3.</span>There is no proof about R. Yehudah's opinion for the same reason!</p>
<p class="bas indent1"><span class="nm">(p)</span><span class="cl">Rejection #2:</span> Perhaps all hold that the orphans are Muchzakim, and R. Yosi holds like Abaye Kashisha. (When selling for food she tells witnesses, so the orphans cannot say that it was for the Kesuvah. She does not write specify in the document, lest buyers will be able to show when she collected her entire Kesuvah, and stop her from collecting from Bnei Chorin afterwards.)</p>
<p class="bas indent2"><span class="nm">1.</span><span class="cl">(Abaye Kashisha):</span> A parable for R. Yosi is a dying man who said 'give 200 Zuz to Ploni my creditor.' Ploni can take (from Bnei Chorin) for his debt, or for a gift.</p>
<p class="bas indent2"><span class="nm">2.</span>Surely, it is better to take it for the gift! (Tosfos - in either case he is entitled to get both. It is better to take the gift from Bnei Chorin, so he can collect the debt from sold property!)</p>
