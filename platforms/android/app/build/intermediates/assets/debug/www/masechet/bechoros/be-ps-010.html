<p class="bas subject"><span class="nm">1)</span>RAVA'S SOURCE</p>
<p class="bas indent1"><span class="nm">(a)</span><span class="cl">Rava:</span> I learn from a Beraisa;</p>
<p class="bas indent2"><span class="nm">1.</span><span class="cl">(Beraisa):</span> The following receive Tum'as Ochlim, even though they are Isurei Hana'ah:</p>
<p class="bas indent3"><span class="nm">i.</span>Orlah, Kilai ha'Kerem, Shor ha'Niskal (an ox sentenced to be stoned), Eglah Arufah, Tziporei Metzora (he brings birds to permit him to enter the city), Peter Chamor, and Basar v'Chalav.</p>
<p class="bas indent2"><span class="nm">2.</span>R. Shimon says they do not receive Tum'as Ochlim, except for Basar v'Chalav, for it had Sha'as ha'Kosher (it was once permitted to Yisrael, when they were first mixed together, before they were cooked together).</p>
<p class="bas indent2"><span class="nm">3.</span><span class="cl">(Rav Asi):</span> R. Shimon learns from "mi'Kol ha'Ochel Asher Ye'achel" - something is considered food (regarding Tum'as Ochlim) only if one may feed it to others (Nochrim. I.e., one may benefit from it, even if a Yisrael may not eat it).</p>
<p class="bas indent2"><span class="nm">4.</span><span class="cl">Question:</span> Why is R. Shimon Metamei Basar v'Chalav due to She'as ha'Kosher? It suffices that one may feed it to others!</p>
<p class="bas indent3"><span class="nm">i.</span><span class="cl">(Beraisa - R. Shimon ben Yehudah citing R. Shimon):</span> One may not eat Basar v'Chalav, but one may benefit from it. It says "Ki Am Kodesh Atah (... Lo Sevashel Gedi ba'Chalev Imo)," similar to "v'Anshei Kodesh Tiheyun Li (u'Vasar ba'Sadeh Terefah Lo Sochelu)";</p>
<p class="bas indent3"><span class="nm">ii.</span>Just like one may benefit from a Terefah but not eat it, the same applies to Basar v'Chalav.</p>
<p class="bas indent2"><span class="nm">5.</span><span class="cl">Answer:</span> R. Shimon gives a second reason to be Metamei Basar v'Chalav;</p>
<p class="bas indent3"><span class="nm">i.</span>Firstly, it is Tamei because one may feed it to others (he permits benefit from it). Secondly, it was once permitted to Yisrael.</p>
<p class="bas indent2"><span class="nm">6.</span><span class="cl">Summation of Rava's source:</span> If R. Shimon permits benefit from Peter Chamor after Arifah, he should agree that it is Mekabel Tum'as Ochlim!</p>
<p class="bas indent1"><span class="nm">(b)</span><span class="cl">Rejection:</span> If one intended to eat it, indeed R. Shimon would agree;</p>
<p class="bas indent2"><span class="nm">1.</span>R. Shimon is Metaher when there was no intent to eat it.</p>
<p class="bas indent1"><span class="nm">(c)</span><span class="cl">Question:</span> If there was no intent, why are Chachamim Metamei?</p>
<p class="bas indent1"><span class="nm">(d)</span><span class="cl">Answer #1 (Rabanan):</span> Isuro Chishuvo (the Torah forbids it, this shows that it is considered food)!</p>
<p class="bas indent1"><span class="nm">(e)</span><span class="cl">Question (Rav Sheshes):</span> Do Chachamim really hold that Isuro Chishuvo?</p>
<p class="bas indent2"><span class="nm">1.</span><span class="cl">(Mishnah):</span> There are 13 laws of Nivlas Ohf Tahor (the Nevelah of a Tahor bird). One is, it requires intent (to eat it in order to receive Tum'as Ochlim, for normally people do not eat it);</p>
<p class="bas indent3"><span class="nm">i.</span>(Because it has a severe Tum'ah, i.e. it is Metamei one who eats it,) it does not require Hechsher for Tum'as Ochlim. (It is Mekabel Tum'ah even if no liquid was put on it. Some explain that it has Tum'as Ochlim even without touching Tum'ah.)</p>
<p class="bas indent2"><span class="nm">2.</span>If Isuro Chishuvo, it should receive Tum'as Ochlim without intent!</p>
<p class="bas indent1"><span class="nm">(f)</span><span class="cl">Answer:</span> That Mishnah is like R. Shimon. (He does not hold that Isuro Chishuvo.)</p>
<p class="bas indent1"><span class="nm">(g)</span><span class="cl">Question (Mishnah):</span> The following require intent, but they do not require Hechsher:</p>
<p class="bas indent2"><span class="nm">1.</span>The Nevelah of a Tamei (species of) animal, in any place;</p>
<p class="bas indent2"><span class="nm">2.</span>Nivlas Ohf Tahor and Chelev in villages.</p>
<p class="bas indent2"><span class="nm">3.</span>If Isuro Chishuvo, they should not require intent!</p>
<p class="bas indent1"><span class="nm">(h)</span><span class="cl">Answer:</span> Also that Mishnah is also like R. Shimon.</p>
<p class="bas indent1"><span class="nm">(i)</span><span class="cl">Question (Mishnah):</span> The following do not require intent (because some people eat them) nor Hechsher;</p>
<p class="bas indent2"><span class="nm">1.</span>The Nevelah of a Tahor animal, in any place;</p>
<p class="bas indent2"><span class="nm">2.</span>Nivlas Ohf Tahor and Chelev in markets.</p>
<p class="bas indent2"><span class="nm">3.</span><span class="cl">Inference:</span> Nevelah of a Tamei animal requires intent!</p>
<p class="bas indent2"><span class="nm">4.</span><span class="cl">Suggestion:</span> Perhaps also this is like R. Shimon.</p>
<p class="bas indent2"><span class="nm">5.</span><span class="cl">Rejection:</span> Since the Seifa is like R. Shimon, the Reisha is not R. Shimon!</p>
<p class="bas indent3"><span class="nm">i.</span><span class="cl">(Seifa - R. Shimon):</span> Also a camel, hare and hyrax and pig do not need intent nor Hechsher.</p>
<p class="bas indent3"><span class="nm">ii.</span><span class="cl">(Beraisa - R. Shimon):</span> This is because each has one Siman of Kashrus.</p>
<p class="bas indent1"><span class="nm">(j)</span><span class="cl">Answer #2 (to Question (c) - Rava):</span> No one holds that Isuro Chishuvo;</p>
<p class="bas indent2"><span class="nm">1.</span>If Arifah was done, all agree that it is Tahor;</p>
<p class="bas bbbline">10b----------------------------------------10b</p>
<p class="bas indent2"><span class="nm">2.</span>They argue about Shechitah for the sake of practicing, like Nimus and R. Eliezer.</p>
<p class="bas indent2"><span class="nm">3.</span><span class="cl">(Beraisa - Nimus):</span> If one slaughtered a raven to practice, its blood is Machshir;</p>
<p class="bas indent2"><span class="nm">4.</span>R. Eliezer says, blood of Shechitah is always Machshir.</p>
<p class="bas indent2"><span class="nm">5.</span><span class="cl">Question:</span> This is like Nimus!</p>
<p class="bas indent2"><span class="nm">6.</span><span class="cl">Answer #1:</span> They argue about whether Isuro Chishuvo;</p>
<p class="bas indent3"><span class="nm">i.</span>Nimus says that its blood is Machshir other food, but the raven itself is not Huchshar without intent. R. Eliezer says that blood of Shechitah is always Machshir. Even the raven is Huchshar without intent.</p>
<p class="bas indent2"><span class="nm">7.</span><span class="cl">Rejection:</span> Perhaps R. Eliezer is Machshir because a raven has (two) Simanei Taharah! (There are four Simanim of Tamei birds, i.e. similarities to a Nesher. Every other Tamei species has at most three Simanei Tum'ah, and at least one Siman Taharah.)</p>
<p class="bas indent2"><span class="nm">8.</span><span class="cl">Question:</span> What is the source that Simanei Taharah affect Hechsher?</p>
<p class="bas indent2"><span class="nm">9.</span><span class="cl">Answer: (Beraisa - R. Shimon):</span> (The camel, hare... do not need intent nor Hechsher;) this is because each has one Siman of Kashrus.</p>
<p class="bas indent2"><span class="nm">10.</span><span class="cl">Question:</span> If R. Eliezer is Machshir due to Simanei Taharah, why does the Beraisa discuss Shechitah for practice? He should be Machshir even Mis'asek! (He was not intending to slaughter, and he slaughtered!)</p>
<p class="bas indent2"><span class="nm">11.</span><span class="cl">Answer:</span> Indeed, he is Machshir even Mis'asek. The Beraisa discusses Shechitah for practice to teach the extremity of R. Nimus. Even though he intended to slaughter, it is not Machshir the bird.</p>
<p class="bas indent1"><span class="nm">(k)</span><span class="cl">Question (Beraisa - R. Yehudah):</span> If he did not want to give a Seh to a Kohen, he breaks its neck from the back with a Kopitz (chopping knife) and buries it. It is Asur b'Hana'ah;</p>
<p class="bas indent2"><span class="nm">1.</span>R. Shimon permits benefit from it.</p>
<p class="bas indent1"><span class="nm">(l)</span><span class="cl">Answer:</span> This means that R. Yehudah forbids benefit mi'Chayim (while it is alive), and R. Shimon permits.</p>
<p class="bas indent1"><span class="nm">(m)</span><span class="cl">Question:</span> Since the Seifa discusses mi'Chayim, the Reisha does not discuss mi'Chayim!</p>
<p class="bas indent2"><span class="nm">1.</span><span class="cl">(Seifa - R. Yehudah):</span> He may not kill it with a reed, scythe, axe, or saw. He may not lock it in a room to die. One may not shear it or work with it;</p>
<p class="bas indent2"><span class="nm">2.</span>R. Shimon permits.</p>
<p class="bas indent1"><span class="nm">(n)</span><span class="cl">Answer:</span> The entire Beraisa discusses benefit mi'Chayim. The Reisha discusses benefit from its value (e.g. to rent it), the Seifa discusses benefit from it itself;</p>
<p class="bas indent1"><span class="nm">(o)</span>It must teach both cases;</p>
<p class="bas indent2"><span class="nm">1.</span>Had it taught only about benefit from its value, one might have thought that R. Shimon permits this, but forbids benefit from it itself;</p>
<p class="bas indent2"><span class="nm">2.</span>Had it taught only about benefit from it itself, one might have thought that R. Yehudah forbids this, but permits benefit from its value.</p>
<p class="bas subject"><span class="nm">2)</span>RAV NACHMAN'S TEACHING</p>
<p class="bas indent1"><span class="nm">(a)</span><span class="cl">Version #1:</span> Also Rav Nachman taught that R. Shimon agrees that Peter Chamor is Asur b'Hana'ah after Arifah.</p>
<p class="bas indent1"><span class="nm">(b)</span><span class="cl">Support (Rav Nachman for himself - Beraisa):</span> It says "va'Arafto" regarding Peter Chamor, like it says regarding Eglah Arufah;</p>
<p class="bas indent2"><span class="nm">1.</span>Just like there it is Asur b'Hana'ah (after Arifah), also here.</p>
<p class="bas indent2"><span class="nm">2.</span><span class="cl">Question:</span> Who is the Tana of the Beraisa?</p>
<p class="bas indent3"><span class="nm">i.</span>It cannot be R. Yehudah. He forbids benefit even mi'Chayim!</p>
<p class="bas indent2"><span class="nm">3.</span><span class="cl">Answer #1:</span> It is R. Shimon.</p>
<p class="bas indent1"><span class="nm">(c)</span><span class="cl">Rejection (and Answer #2 - Rav Safra):</span> Really, the Beraisa is R. Yehudah;</p>
<p class="bas indent2"><span class="nm">1.</span>One might have thought that Arifah is in place of redemption. Just like it is permitted after redemption, also after Arifah;</p>
<p class="bas indent2"><span class="nm">2.</span>The Beraisa teaches that this is not so.</p>
<p class="bas indent1"><span class="nm">(d)</span><span class="cl">Support (Rav Nachman for himself - Levi - Beraisa):</span> Because the Yisrael deprived the Kohen (he refused to give a Seh), the Torah deprives him of his money (commands him to kill the Peter Chamor).</p>
<p class="bas indent2"><span class="nm">1.</span><span class="cl">Question:</span> Who is the Tana of the Beraisa?</p>
<p class="bas indent3"><span class="nm">i.</span>It cannot be R. Yehudah. He forbids benefit even mi'Chayim (Arifah does not deprive the Yisrael. He was already deprived!)</p>
<p class="bas indent2"><span class="nm">2.</span><span class="cl">Answer #1:</span> It is R. Shimon.</p>
<p class="bas indent1"><span class="nm">(e)</span><span class="cl">Rejection:</span> The Beraisa can be like either Tana. In any case it does not support Rav Nachman;</p>
<p class="bas indent2"><span class="nm">1.</span>It can be like R. Yehudah. (The Yisrael could have redeemed the Peter Chamor for a Seh worth less than it, so) Arifah deprives him of the difference;</p>
<p class="bas indent2"><span class="nm">2.</span>It can be like R. Shimon, and yet he may benefit from it after Arifah. Arifah deprives him of the difference in value (of a live donkey from a dead one).</p>
<p class="bas indent1"><span class="nm">(f)</span><span class="cl">(Reish Lakish):</span> R. Shimon agrees that Peter Chamor is Asur b'Hana'ah after Arifah;</p>
<p class="bas indent1"><span class="nm">(g)</span><span class="cl">(R. Yochanan):</span> He argues (and permits) also after Arifah.</p>
<p class="bas indent1"><span class="nm">(h)</span><span class="cl">Version #2A - (Mishnah):</span> If Reuven was Mekadesh Leah with a Peter Chamor, she is not Mekudeshes.</p>
<p class="bas indent1"><span class="nm">(i)</span><span class="cl">Suggestion:</span> This is like R. Yehudah. According to R. Shimon, one may benefit from a Peter Chamor, so she would be Mekudeshes!</p>
<p class="bas indent1"><span class="nm">(j)</span><span class="cl">Rejection (Rav Nachman):</span> The Chamor was given after Arifah. The Mishnah is even like R. Shimon.</p>
<p class="bas indent1"><span class="nm">(k)</span><span class="cl">Version #2B - Question:</span> The Mishnah is not like R. Yehudah, nor like R. Shimon!</p>
<p class="bas indent2"><span class="nm">1.</span>It is not like R. Shimon. He permits benefit from a Peter Chamor. She would be Mekudeshes!</p>
<p class="bas indent2"><span class="nm">2.</span>It is not like R. Yehudah. He holds that she would be Mekudeshes with the net value she received, i.e. the value of the donkey less the cost (of a Seh) to redeem it!</p>
<p class="bas indent1"><span class="nm">(l)</span><span class="cl">Answer (Rabah bar Avuha):</span> It is like R. Yehudah. The case is, the Peter Chamor is worth only one Shekel. (It has no net value, for) R. Yehudah holds like his son;</p>
<p class="bas indent2"><span class="nm">1.</span><span class="cl">(Beraisa):</span> It says "Tifdeh" twice teaches that a Peter Chamor may be redeemed immediately, and it may be redeemed for (a Seh worth) any amount;</p>
<p class="bas indent2"><span class="nm">2.</span>R. Yosi bar Yehudah says, the (Seh for) redemption must be (worth) at least one Shekel.</p>
<p class="bas indent1"><span class="nm">(m)</span><span class="cl">Question:</span> The first Tana learns that it may be redeemed immediately and for (a Seh worth) any amount because it says "Tifdeh" twice. This is obvious! (Why would we think otherwise?)</p>
<p class="bas indent1"><span class="nm">(n)</span><span class="cl">Answer:</span> Peter Chamor is equated to Bechor Adam;</p>
<p class="bas indent2"><span class="nm">1.</span>One might have thought that just like Bechor Adam cannot be redeemed until 30 days, and it must be redeemed for five Shekalim, the same applies to Peter Chamor. "Tifdeh" and "Tifdeh" teach that this is not so.</p>
<p class="bas indent1"><span class="nm">(o)</span><span class="cl">(Beraisa - R. Yosi bar Yehudah):</span> The redemption must be at least one Shekel.</p>
<p class="bas indent1"><span class="nm">(p)</span><span class="cl">Question:</span> In any case, this is difficult!</p>
<p class="bas indent2"><span class="nm">1.</span>If R. Yosi equates Peter Chamor to Bechor Adam, he should require five Shekalim;</p>
<p class="bas indent2"><span class="nm">2.</span>If he does not equate them, why does he require a Shekel?</p>
<p class="bas indent1"><span class="nm">(q)</span><span class="cl">Answer (Rava):</span> Really, he does not equate them;</p>
<p class="bas indent2"><span class="nm">1.</span>"V'Chol Erkecha Yihyeh b'Shekel ha'Kodesh" teaches that every Erech (for our purposes, redemption) must be at least one Shekel.</p>
<p class="bas indent2"><span class="nm">2.</span>Chachamim disagree. They say that the verse teaches about Heseg Yad. (If a poor person pledged to give an Erech and cannot afford it, he pays what he can afford, but it must be at least one Shekel.)</p>
