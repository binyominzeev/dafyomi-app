<p class="bas subject"><span class="nm">1)</span>ATTRIBUTES OF <i>CHACHAMIM</i> (cont.)</p>
<p class="bas indent1"><span class="nm">(a)</span>R. Freida attributed his long life to these merits:</p>
<p class="bas indent2"><span class="nm">1.</span>No one ever came to the Beis Medrash before him; he never blessed (at a meal) before a Kohen; he never ate from an animal before the Zero'a, Lechayim v'Kevah were separated (to be given to a Kohen).</p>
<p class="bas indent2"><span class="nm">2.</span><span class="cl">(R. Yitzchak):</span> Eating from an animal before the Matanos are separated is (forbidden) like eating Tevel.</p>
<p class="bas indent2"><span class="nm">3.</span>The Halachah does not follow R. Yitzchak.</p>
<p class="bas indent1"><span class="nm">(b)</span><span class="cl">Question:</span> Is it praiseworthy that he never blessed before a Kohen?!</p>
<p class="bas indent2"><span class="nm">1.</span><span class="cl">(R. Yochanan):</span> If a Chacham allows an ignoramus Kohen, even a Kohen Gadol, to bless before him, he is worthy of death.</p>
<p class="bas indent2"><span class="nm">2.</span>It says "Kol Mesan'ai Ohavu Maves" - we read this 'Masni'ai' (those who make people hate 'me' (Torah)).</p>
<p class="bas indent1"><span class="nm">(c)</span><span class="cl">Answer:</span> R. Freida never blessed before a Kohen Chacham (even if he was a greater Chacham than the Kohen).</p>
<p class="bas indent1"><span class="nm">(d)</span>R. Nechunya ben Hakanah attributed his long life to the following merits:</p>
<p class="bas indent2"><span class="nm">1.</span>He refused to get honor from his colleague's disgrace, similar to Rav Huna;</p>
<p class="bas indent3"><span class="nm">i.</span>Rav Chana bar Chanilai offered to carry Rav Huna's shovel. Rav Huna said 'unless you normally carry your own shovel, I refuse.'</p>
<p class="bas indent2"><span class="nm">2.</span>He would not sleep before forgiving one who had cursed him. This is like Mar Zutra. Before Mar Zutra went to sleep he would forgive all who pained him.</p>
<p class="bas indent2"><span class="nm">3.</span>He was easygoing with his money. This is like Iyov, who used to give a Perutah of his money to a grocer. (Bava Basra 15b says that when a regular person owes a worker half a Perutah (the smallest coin is a Perutah), they go to a grocer and share something that costs a Perutah. Iyov would give the full Perutah. Perhaps Iyov did not want his generosity to 'deprive' the grocer, so he would give the grocer a Perutah in such a case.)</p>
<p class="bas indent1"><span class="nm">(e)</span>R. Akiva asked R. Nechunya ha'Gadol why he lived so long (i.e. in what merits). R. Nechunya's servants thought that R. Akiva was unhappy that he lived so long. They hit him, and he ran up a tree.</p>
<p class="bas indent2"><span class="nm">1.</span><span class="cl">Question (R. Akiva):</span> Why does it say "Es ha'Keves <i>Echad</i>"? "Ha'Keves" (singular) already teaches that there is only one!</p>
<p class="bas indent3"><span class="nm">i.</span>R. Nechunya realized that R. Akiva was a Chacham; he told his servants not to bother him.</p>
<p class="bas indent2"><span class="nm">2.</span><span class="cl">Answer (R. Nechunya):</span> This teaches that it should be the best in the herd.</p>
<p class="bas indent1"><span class="nm">(f)</span>R. Nechunya attributed his long life to the following merits:</p>
<p class="bas indent2"><span class="nm">1.</span>I never received gifts; I never repaid the pain someone gave me; I was open with my money.</p>
<p class="bas indent2"><span class="nm">2.</span>Not receiving gifts is like R. Elazar, who would not accept gifts or invitations from the Nasi's house, because "Sonei Matanos Yichyeh";</p>
<p class="bas indent3"><span class="nm">i.</span>R. Zeira would not accept gifts, but he accepted invitations from the Nasi's house. He reasoned that his coming honors them.</p>
<p class="bas indent2"><span class="nm">3.</span>Not returning pain is like Rava taught, that if one overlooks what others do to him, all his transgressions are overlooked.</p>
<p class="bas indent1"><span class="nm">(g)</span>R. Yehoshua ben Korchah attributed his long life to the fact that he never looked at an evil person.</p>
<p class="bas indent2"><span class="nm">1.</span><span class="cl">(R. Yochanan):</span> One may not look at an evil person.</p>
<p class="bas indent2"><span class="nm">2.</span><span class="cl">(R. Elazar):</span> Looking at a Rasha weakens eyes. Yitzchak became blind because he had looked at Esav.</p>
<p class="bas indent3"><span class="nm">i.</span><span class="cl">Question:</span> R. Yitzchak taught that Avimelech's curse was the cause!</p>
<p class="bas indent3"><span class="nm">ii.</span><span class="cl">Answer:</span> Both caused it.</p>
<p class="bas indent2"><span class="nm">3.</span><span class="cl">(Rava):</span> We learn from "Seis Pnei Rasha Lo Tov".</p>
<p class="bas indent1"><span class="nm">(h)</span>When R. Yehoshua ben Korchah was about to die, Rebbi requested a Berachah:</p>
<p class="bas indent1"><span class="nm">(i)</span><span class="cl">R. Yehoshua:</span> You should live to half my age.</p>
<p class="bas indent1"><span class="nm">(j)</span><span class="cl">Rebbi:</span> Should I not live to your entire age?!</p>
<p class="bas indent1"><span class="nm">(k)</span><span class="cl">R. Yehoshua:</span> Should your sons be shepherds?! (If you live so long, sons will never become Nasi.)</p>
<p class="bas indent1"><span class="nm">(l)</span>Avuha bar Ihi or Minyamin bar Ihi praised himself for never looking at a Kusi. The other praised himself for never becoming a partner with a Kusi.</p>
<p class="bas indent1"><span class="nm">(m)</span>R. Zeira attributed his long life to the following merits:</p>
<p class="bas indent2"><span class="nm">1.</span>He never was demanding in his house; he never walked in front of someone greater than himself; he didn't think in Torah where there was a bad smell; he didn't walk four Amos without Torah and Tefilin; he never slept in a Beis Medrash, not fixed nor haphazardly; he didn't rejoice at the stumbling of a colleague; he never called someone by his nickname or family nickname.</p>
<p class="bas subject"><span class="nm">2)</span>PROPER CONDUCT IN A <i>BEIS HA'KENESES</i></p><i>
</i><p class="bas indent1"><span class="nm">(a)</span><span class="cl">(Mishnah - R. Yehudah):</span> In a destroyed Beis ha'Keneses we may not eulogize, twine ropes, set traps, spread fruit on the roof to dry, or make it a shortcut.</p>
<p class="bas indent2"><span class="nm">1.</span>"I will make desolate your holy places" - even when they are desolate, they are Kodesh.</p>
<p class="bas indent1"><span class="nm">(b)</span>If weeds grow in it, we do not cut them, to cause grief (that it is desolate).</p>
<p class="bas indent1"><span class="nm">(c)</span><span class="cl">(Gemara - Beraisa):</span> We do not conduct ourselves frivolously in Batei Kenesiyos. We do not eat, drink, adorn ourselves, or stroll in them;</p>
<p class="bas bbbline">28b----------------------------------------28b</p>
<p class="bas indent1"><span class="nm">(d)</span>We do not enter a Beis ha'Keneses to avoid heat or rain; we do not eulogize an individual in a Beis ha'Keneses.</p>
<p class="bas indent1"><span class="nm">(e)</span>We may learn in a Beis ha'Keneses, and give mass eulogies (e.g. of a Chacham);</p>
<p class="bas indent1"><span class="nm">(f)</span>R. Yehudah says, this applies when they are settled. When they are desolate we abandon them, and let weeds grow to cause grief.</p>
<p class="bas indent1"><span class="nm">(g)</span><span class="cl">Question:</span> (The Beraisa connotes that R. Yehudah argues, but) the first Tana didn't mention weeds!</p>
<p class="bas indent1"><span class="nm">(h)</span><span class="cl">Answer:</span> The Beraisa is abbreviated, it means as follows:</p>
<p class="bas indent2"><span class="nm">1.</span>We sweep and wash the floor, so weeds will not grow;</p>
<p class="bas indent2"><span class="nm">2.</span>R. Yehudah says, this applies when they are settled. When they are desolate we let weeds grow and do not cut them, to cause grief.</p>
<p class="bas indent1"><span class="nm">(i)</span><span class="cl">(Rav Asi):</span> Batei Kenesiyos in Bavel are made on condition (that we may use them when they will be desolate). Nevertheless, we do not act in them frivolously, i.e. to make calculations;</p>
<p class="bas indent2"><span class="nm">1.</span>We leave a corpse overnight in a Beis ha'Keneses in which calculations are made.</p>
<p class="bas indent2"><span class="nm">2.</span><span class="cl">Objection:</span> Surely there is no obligation to do so!</p>
<p class="bas indent2"><span class="nm">3.</span><span class="cl">Clarification:</span> It means that (Hash-m will punish for this, and) a Mes Mitzvah will be left there overnight.</p>
<p class="bas indent1"><span class="nm">(j)</span><span class="cl">(Beraisa):</span> We do not adorn ourselves (in a Beis ha'Keneses)</p>
<p class="bas indent1"><span class="nm">(k)</span><span class="cl">(Rava):</span> Chachamim are permitted.</p>
<p class="bas indent2"><span class="nm">1.</span><span class="cl">(R. Yehoshua ben Levi):</span> It (a Beis Medrash) is called 'the house of Rabanan'. This shows that they may use it like their home (in all ways).</p>
<p class="bas indent1"><span class="nm">(l)</span>Rava was teaching Ravina and Rav Acha bar Masnah. A torrential rain came; they entered a Beis ha'Keneses.</p>
<p class="bas indent2"><span class="nm">1.</span>They did not enter to avoid the rain, rather, for the sake of learning, which requires clarity.</p>
<p class="bas indent1"><span class="nm">(m)</span><span class="cl">(Rav Acha Brei d'Rava):</span> If one must enter a Beis ha'Keneses to call someone:</p>
<p class="bas indent2"><span class="nm">1.</span>If he is a Chacham, he should say a Halachah. If he just knows Mishnah, he should say a Mishnah; if he knows just Tanach, he should say a verse; if not, he should ask a child to read the verse he is learning, or delay for a short time.</p>
<p class="bas subject"><span class="nm">3)</span>EULOGIES</p>
<p class="bas indent1"><span class="nm">(a)</span><span class="cl">(Beraisa):</span> We may give mass eulogies.</p>
<p class="bas indent1"><span class="nm">(b)</span><span class="cl">Question:</span> What is an example of this?</p>
<p class="bas indent1"><span class="nm">(c)</span><span class="cl">Answer #1 (Rav Chisda):</span> It is a eulogy that would be given for someone from the house of Rav Sheshes.</p>
<p class="bas indent1"><span class="nm">(d)</span><span class="cl">Answer #2 (Rav Sheshes):</span> It is a eulogy that would be given for someone from the house of Rav Chisda.</p>
<p class="bas indent1"><span class="nm">(e)</span>Rafram eulogized his daughter-in-law in a Beis ha'Keneses. He reasoned that everyone will come for his honor or hers. R. Zeira eulogized a Chacham in a Beis ha'Keneses for the same reason.</p>
<p class="bas indent1"><span class="nm">(f)</span>Reish Lakish eulogized a man who sat in the 24th row of Talmidim and learned Halachos. He said 'Eretz Yisrael has lost a great man.' (This is like the Maharsha. Rashba - he learned Halachos, and Reish Lakish gave a great eulogy to 24 rows of people. Rashi says that he <i>taught</i> Mishnayos to 24 rows of Talmidim. According to this, perhaps he was greater than the man Rav Nachman refused to eulogize; if so, the Gemara's conclusion (See the difference... ) is not so clear.)</p>
<p class="bas indent1"><span class="nm">(g)</span>Rav Nachman refused to eulogize a man who learned (Rashi - taught) Mishnah, Medrash and Tosefta, because 'He is empty' (he never learned how to resolve difficulties in the Mishnah).</p>
<p class="bas indent2"><span class="nm">1.</span>See the difference between the mighty ones of Eretz Yisrael and the Chasidim of Bavel (Reish Lakish gave a lavish praise for a Talmid, whereas Rav Nachman refused to eulogize someone who was more learned)!</p>
<p class="bas indent1"><span class="nm">(h)</span><span class="cl">(Mishnah):</span> One who uses the crown (of Torah) will perish.</p>
<p class="bas indent1"><span class="nm">(i)</span><span class="cl">(Reish Lakish):</span> This is one who is served by one who learns Halachos.</p>
<p class="bas indent1"><span class="nm">(j)</span><span class="cl">(Ula):</span> One may use someone who learns four (Sedorim of the Mishnah which apply in Bavel), but not someone who teaches them.</p>
<p class="bas indent1"><span class="nm">(k)</span>A man was carrying Reish Lakish through water. When Reish Lakish heard that the man learned the four Sedorim, he refused to be carried.</p>
<p class="bas indent2"><span class="nm">1.</span><span class="cl">The man:</span> I want to serve you!</p>
<p class="bas indent2"><span class="nm">2.</span><span class="cl">Reish Lakish:</span> If so, I will teach you something. R. Zeira taught that Benos Yisrael are stringent on themselves to wait seven clean days (before Tevilah) after seeing even a drop of blood.</p>
<p class="bas indent1"><span class="nm">(l)</span><span class="cl">(Tana d'Vei Eliyahu):</span> One who learns Halachos every day has a share in the world to come;</p>
<p class="bas indent2"><span class="nm">1.</span>It says "Halichos Olam Lo" - we read this Halachos.</p>
