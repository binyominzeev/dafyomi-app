<p class="bas indent1"><span class="nm">(a)</span><span class="cl">(Mishnah):</span> Similarly, braiding hair...</p>
<p class="bas indent1"><span class="nm">(b)</span><span class="cl">Question:</span> [According to R. Eliezer,] for which Melachos is one liable for braiding, coloring eyes and Pokeses?</p>
<p class="bas indent1"><span class="nm">(c)</span><span class="cl">Answer #1 (R. Avin citing R. Yosi b'Rebbi Chanina):</span> One is liable for braiding on account of weaving, one is liable for coloring eyes on account of writing, one is liable for Pokeses on account of spinning.</p>
<p class="bas indent1"><span class="nm">(d)</span><span class="cl">Objection (Rabanan):</span> This is not the normal way to weave, write, or spin!</p>
<p class="bas indent1"><span class="nm">(e)</span><span class="cl">Answer #2 (R. Avahu citing R. Yosi b'Rebbi Chanina):</span> One is liable for coloring eyes on account of dying, one is liable for braiding and Pokeses on account of building.</p>
<p class="bas indent1"><span class="nm">(f)</span><span class="cl">Objection (Rabanan):</span> Is this the normal way to build?!</p>
<p class="bas indent1"><span class="nm">(g)</span><span class="cl">Answer:</span> Yes!</p>
<p class="bas indent2"><span class="nm">1.</span><span class="cl">(R. Shimon ben Menasiyah):</span> "Va'Yiven Hash-m Elokim Es ha'Tzela" - Hash-m braided Chavah's hair and brought her to Adam;</p>
<p class="bas indent2"><span class="nm">2.</span>Braiding is called 'building' in the language of certain islands.</p>
<p class="bas indent1"><span class="nm">(h)</span><span class="cl">(Beraisa - R. Shimon ben Elazar):</span> If a woman braided or colored her own hair or eyes or was Pokeses herself, she is exempt; if she did so for another woman, she is liable.</p>
<p class="bas indent1"><span class="nm">(i)</span>R. Shimon ben Elazar cited R. Eliezer to forbid a woman to put rouge on her face, on account of dying.</p>
<p class="bas subject"><span class="nm">2)</span>STRINGENCIES OF R. ELIEZER</p>
<p class="bas indent1"><span class="nm">(a)</span><span class="cl">(Beraisa - R. Eliezer):</span> If one milked, curdled milk or made cheese the Shi'ur of k'Grogeres, swept or Ribetz (sprinkled water to prevent dust from rising) or removed cakes of honey from a hive:</p>
<p class="bas indent2"><span class="nm">1.</span>If he did so on Shabbos b'Shogeg, he is Chayav Chatas; if he did so on Yom Tov b'Mezid, he gets 40 lashes.</p>
<p class="bas indent1"><span class="nm">(b)</span>Chachamim say, these are forbidden only mid'Rabanan.</p>
<p class="bas indent1"><span class="nm">(c)</span><span class="cl">Questions:</span> [According to R. Eliezer,] for which Melachah is one liable for milking, curdling milk or making cheese?</p>
<p class="bas indent1"><span class="nm">(d)</span><span class="cl">Answer #1 (Rav Nachman bar Gurya):</span> He is liable for milking, curdling and making cheese.</p>
<p class="bas indent1"><span class="nm">(e)</span><span class="cl">The questioners:</span> Your Rebbi did not know how to teach!</p>
<p class="bas indent1"><span class="nm">(f)</span><span class="cl">Answer #2 (Rabanan of the Beis Medrash):</span> One who milks is liable for Mefarek (Rashi - removing a food from where it was covered, it is a Toladah of threshing); one who curdles is liable for Borer (he removes the whey), one who makes cheese is liable for building.</p>
<p class="bas indent1"><span class="nm">(g)</span><span class="cl">(R. Elazar):</span> R. Eliezer learns [to Mechayev for removing honey] from "Va'Yitbol Osah b'Ya'aros ha'Devash":</p>
<p class="bas indent2"><span class="nm">1.</span><span class="cl">Question:</span> What is the connection of the forest to honey (why was it mentioned)?</p>
<p class="bas indent2"><span class="nm">2.</span><span class="cl">Answer:</span> Just like one who detaches from a forest [on Shabbos] is Chayav Chatas, also one who takes honey from a hive.</p>
<p class="bas indent1"><span class="nm">(h)</span>Ameimar permitted Lerabetz (to sprinkle in the house) in Mechuza (all the houses had stone floors).</p>
<p class="bas indent2"><span class="nm">1.</span><span class="cl">(Ameimar):</span> Chachamim forbade this lest one even out hollows [in a dirt floor] - in this city, there are no hollows.</p>
<p class="bas indent1"><span class="nm">(i)</span>Ravina was suffering from the heat (caused by rising dust).</p>
<p class="bas indent1"><span class="nm">(j)</span><span class="cl">Rava Tosfa'ah:</span> Why don't you rely on the Beraisa?!</p>
<p class="bas indent2"><span class="nm">1.</span><span class="cl">(Beraisa):</span> If one wants to Merabetz his house [on Shabbos], he takes a bowl of water, washes his face in one corner, his hands in another corner, his feet in another corner - in this way, he is Merabetz the entire house.</p>
<p class="bas indent1"><span class="nm">(k)</span><span class="cl">Ravina:</span> I didn't think of it (alternatively - I hold that the Halachah is not like this Beraisa).</p>
<p class="bas indent1"><span class="nm">(l)</span><span class="cl">(Beraisa):</span> A Chachamah (the wife or daughter of a Chacham) may Merabetz the house on Shabbos (she can wash different utensils in different parts of the house).</p>
<p class="bas indent2"><span class="nm">1.</span>Nowadays, we hold like R. Shimon (who permits Davar she'Eino Miskaven), one may directly Merabetz.</p>
<p class="bas subject"><span class="nm">3)</span>A FLOWERPOT WITH A HOLE</p>
<p class="bas indent1"><span class="nm">(a)</span><span class="cl">(Mishnah):</span> If one detaches something that was growing in a flowerpot with a hole, he is liable; if the flowerpot does not have a hole, he is exempt;</p>
<p class="bas indent1"><span class="nm">(b)</span>R. Shimon exempts in both cases.</p>
<p class="bas indent1"><span class="nm">(c)</span><span class="cl">(Gemara - Abaye) Question:</span> In our Mishnah, R. Shimon exempts in both cases - this shows that he equates a flowerpot with a hole to one without a hole;</p>
<p class="bas indent2"><span class="nm">1.</span><span class="cl">Contradiction (Beraisa - R. Shimon):</span> The only difference between a flowerpot with a hole and one without a hole is to Machshir seeds (if the flowerpot has a hole, it is as if the contents are growing in the ground, they cannot become Huchshar to Mekabel Tum'ah).</p>
<p class="bas bbbline">95b----------------------------------------95b</p>
<p class="bas indent1"><span class="nm">(d)</span><span class="cl">Answer (Rava):</span> Regarding everything [else] he considers the contents detached - Tum'ah is different, the Torah was Metaher seeds liberally - "Al Kol Zera Zeru'a Asher Yizare'a".</p>
<p class="bas indent1"><span class="nm">(e)</span><span class="cl">Question (an elder):</span> What is R. Shimon's opinion if the root is directly over a hole (is this considered like growing in the ground)?</p>
<p class="bas indent1"><span class="nm">(f)</span>R. Zeira could not answer.</p>
<p class="bas indent1"><span class="nm">(g)</span><span class="cl">(R. Zeira (on another occasion)):</span> R. Shimon agrees [that it is considered attached] if there is a hole in the pot big enough to Metaher it (enough for an olive to fall through).</p>
<p class="bas indent1"><span class="nm">(h)</span><span class="cl">The elder:</span> You could not determine R. Shimon's opinion about a root directly over a hole - all the more so you should be unsure about a hole in the pot big enough to Metaher it!</p>
<p class="bas indent1"><span class="nm">(i)</span><span class="cl">(Abaye):</span> R. Zeira actually taught, R. Shimon agrees about a pot that does not hold a Revi'is [on account of a hole near the bottom, it is not considered a Kli].</p>
<p class="bas subject"><span class="nm">4)</span>SHI'URIM OF KLEI CHERES</p>
<p class="bas indent1"><span class="nm">(a)</span><span class="cl">(Rava):</span> There are five Shi'urim regarding Klei Cheres [with holes]:</p>
<p class="bas indent2"><span class="nm">1.</span>If it is Motzi Mashkeh (if water is inside, it will drip out), a shard (piece that breaks off) is Tahor, it still is Kosher to Mekadesh Mei Chatas (one may put ashes of Parah Adumah on water [drawn or] in such a Kli, all the more so it is a Kli in other respects);</p>
<p class="bas indent2"><span class="nm">2.</span>If it is Kones Mashkeh (water will enter if it is put in water) it is Pasul for Kidush Mei Chatas, it is still a Kli to Machshir seeds (seeds growing in it are not Mekabel Hechsher);</p>
<p class="bas indent2"><span class="nm">3.</span>If the hole is big enough for a small root to pass through, it is not Machshir seeds, it is still a Kli to [Mekabel Tum'ah because it can] hold olives.</p>
<p class="bas indent2"><span class="nm">4.</span>If it is Motzi Zeisim (olives can fall through, if it was Tamei) it becomes Tahor, it is still a Kli to [Mekabel Tum'ah if one will designate it to] hold pomegranates;</p>
<p class="bas indent2"><span class="nm">5.</span>If it is Motzi Rimonim (pomegranates can fall through), it is totally Tahor.</p>
<p class="bas indent2"><span class="nm">6.</span>If it is surrounded by a Tzamid Pasil (it is totally sealed), it is not Mekabel Tum'ah in Ohel ha'Mes unless the majority [of the side] is open (or there is a hole of any size in the top - Ri; R. Tam - it is Mekabel Tum'as Ohel if it has any hole that was not sealed, or if the majority was broken, even if it was sealed).</p>
<p class="bas indent1"><span class="nm">(b)</span><span class="cl">Rav Asi:</span> I heard that the Shi'ur for Klei Cheres is Motzi Rimonim.</p>
<p class="bas indent1"><span class="nm">(c)</span><span class="cl">Rava:</span> Perhaps you heard regarding a Kli with a Tzamid Pasil in Ohel ha'Mes! (Tosfos - Rava did not suggest that Rav Asi heard about the Shi'ur to totally Metaher, for he did not hear that it was designated to hold pomegranates, therefore the Shi'ur is Motzi Zeisim.)</p>
<p class="bas indent1"><span class="nm">(d)</span><span class="cl">Question:</span> Rava himself taught that if it has a Tzamid Pasil, it is not Mekabel Tum'ah unless most of it is open!</p>
<p class="bas indent1"><span class="nm">(e)</span><span class="cl">Answer:</span> Rava taught about big Kelim, Rav Asi heard about small Kelim.</p>
