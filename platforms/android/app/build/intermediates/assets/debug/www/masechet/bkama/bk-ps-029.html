<p class="dedicationbox"><br>PAST DEDICATION<br>BAVA KAMA 28-29 - Two weeks of study material have been dedicated by Mrs. Estanne Abraham Fawer to honor the ninth Yahrzeit of her father, Rav Mordechai ben Eliezer Zvi (Rabbi Morton Weiner) Z'L, who passed away on 18 Teves 5760. May the merit of supporting and advancing Dafyomi study -- which was so important to him -- during the weeks of his Yahrzeit serve as an Iluy for his Neshamah. </p>

<p class="bas subject"><span class="nm">1)</span>THE ARGUMENT OF R. MEIR AND R. YEHUDAH</p>
<p class="bas indent1"><span class="nm">(a)</span><span class="cl">Objection:</span> The Torah exempts for Ones - "you will not punish the Na'arah (who was raped)"!</p>
<p class="bas indent2"><span class="nm">1.</span><span class="cl">Suggestion:</span> Perhaps that applies only to capital punishment, but one is liable for damages, even due to Ones.</p>
<p class="bas indent2"><span class="nm">2.</span><span class="cl">Rejection (Beraisa - R. Meir):</span> If his jug broke and he did not clear away the fragments, or his camel fell, and he did not stand it up, he is liable for damage they caused;</p>
<p class="bas indent2"><span class="nm">3.</span>Chachamim say, Beis Din does not make him pay, but Heaven holds him accountable.</p>
<p class="bas indent3"><span class="nm">i.</span>Chachamim admit to R. Meir that if Reuven left a rock, knife or load on his roof and it fell in a normal wind and damaged, Reuven is liable.</p>
<p class="bas indent3"><span class="nm">ii.</span>R. Meir admits to Chachamim that if he put bottles on the roof to dry, and they fell in an abnormally strong wind, he is exempt.</p>
<p class="bas indent1"><span class="nm">(b)</span><span class="cl">Answer #2 (to Question 3:n, 28b - Abaye):</span> Chachamim (R. Meir) and R. Yehudah argue in two cases: at the time of falling, and afterwards:</p>
<p class="bas indent2"><span class="nm">1.</span>For damage at the time of falling, they argue about whether or not one who trips is negligent. R. Meir says that he is negligent, and R. Yehudah says that he is not. ('Intent' is when he broke the flask b'Mezid. Without intent is when he tripped and it broke.)</p>
<p class="bas indent2"><span class="nm">2.</span>For damage after the time of falling, they argue about one who is Mafkir things that can damage. R. Meir obligates for this, and R. Yehudah exempts.</p>
<p class="bas indent1"><span class="nm">(c)</span><span class="cl">Question:</span> How did Abaye know that (in the Mishnah) they argue about two matters?</p>
<p class="bas indent1"><span class="nm">(d)</span><span class="cl">Answer:</span> The Mishnah gives two cases. Shimon slipped on the water or was damaged by the shards. Seemingly, these are the same!</p>
<p class="bas indent2"><span class="nm">1.</span>Rather, they argue about slipping on the water at the time of falling (i.e. before Reuven was able to clean up the water);</p>
<p class="bas indent2"><span class="nm">2.</span>They argue about damage through the shards after Reuven fell and was Mafkir the shards.</p>
<p class="bas indent1"><span class="nm">(e)</span><span class="cl">Question:</span> Since in the Mishnah they argue in two cases, presumably also in the Beraisa they argue in two cases!</p>
<p class="bas indent2"><span class="nm">1.</span>Granted, the case of the jug breaking could be at the time of falling, or after.</p>
<p class="bas indent2"><span class="nm">2.</span>Granted, the case of the camel falling could be after falling. He was Mafkir the carcass.</p>
<p class="bas indent2"><span class="nm">3.</span>How can they argue about this at the time of falling? He is blameless. Why would R. Meir obligate him to pay?!</p>
<p class="bas indent1"><span class="nm">(f)</span><span class="cl">Answer #1 (Rav Acha):</span> He led the camel where the river was overflowing. This caused it to fall.</p>
<p class="bas indent1"><span class="nm">(g)</span><span class="cl">Objection:</span> What is the case?</p>
<p class="bas indent2"><span class="nm">1.</span>If there is another path, he was negligent. Why do Chachamim exempt him?</p>
<p class="bas indent2"><span class="nm">2.</span>If there is no other path, he is Ones. Why does R. Meir obligate him to pay?</p>
<p class="bas indent1"><span class="nm">(h)</span><span class="cl">Answer #2:</span> Rather, the owner tripped, and the camel tripped on the owner.</p>
<p class="bas indent1"><span class="nm">(i)</span><span class="cl">Question:</span> If he was Mafkir Nezakav (his things that can damage), why does R. Yehudah distinguish between whether or not he intended?</p>
<p class="bas indent1"><span class="nm">(j)</span><span class="cl">Answer (and Answer #3 to 3:n, 28b - Rav Yosef):</span> R. Yehudah agrees that he is liable if he intended that the shards remain his (he was not Mafkir them).</p>
<p class="bas indent1"><span class="nm">(k)</span><span class="cl">(R. Elazar):</span> They argue at the time of falling.</p>
<p class="bas indent1"><span class="nm">(l)</span><span class="cl">Question:</span> Do all agree after the time of falling?!</p>
<p class="bas indent2"><span class="nm">1.</span>You cannot say that they agree that he is exempt. R. Meir obligates!</p>
<p class="bas indent2"><span class="nm">2.</span>You cannot say that they agree that he is liable. Chachamim exempt!</p>
<p class="bas indent2"><span class="nm">3.</span>Rather, R. Elazar must mean that they argue even at the time of falling, like Abaye.</p>
<p class="bas bbbline">29b----------------------------------------29b</p>
<p class="bas subject"><span class="nm">2)</span>ANOTHER EXPLANATION OF THE BERAISA</p>
<p class="bas indent1"><span class="nm">(a)</span><span class="cl">(R. Yochanan):</span> They argue after the time of falling.</p>
<p class="bas indent1"><span class="nm">(b)</span><span class="cl">Question:</span> Do all agree that he is exempt at the time of falling?!</p>
<p class="bas indent2"><span class="nm">1.</span>R. Yochanan said 'do not say that the Mishnah (31b) is only like R. Meir, who says that one who trips is negligent.' This implies that R. Meir says that he is liable!</p>
<p class="bas indent1"><span class="nm">(c)</span><span class="cl">Counter-question:</span> Can you say that at the time of falling, all agree that he is liable?!</p>
<p class="bas indent2"><span class="nm">1.</span>R. Yochanan's teaching (just quoted) implies that Chachamim exempt!</p>
<p class="bas indent1"><span class="nm">(d)</span><span class="cl">Answer to both questions:</span> R. Yochanan teaches that here Chachamim exempt one who was Mafkir Nezakav in Reshus ha'Rabim only if this was due to Ones. If he intentionally put them there, all agree that he is liable. (However, the Tana'im could also argue about at the time of falling, when it was Ones.)</p>
<p class="bas indent1"><span class="nm">(e)</span>R. Yochanan and R. Elazar argued about one who makes Nezakav Hefker. One of them obligates, and the other exempts.</p>
<p class="bas indent1"><span class="nm">(f)</span><span class="cl">Suggestion:</span> The one who obligates holds like R. Meir, and the other holds like Chachamim.</p>
<p class="bas indent1"><span class="nm">(g)</span><span class="cl">Rejection:</span> No. Granted, the one who exempts must hold like Chachamim (since R. Meir obligates even one who is Mafkir Nezakav after they fell b'Ones!)</p>
<p class="bas indent2"><span class="nm">1.</span>However, the one who obligates could hold like Chachamim.</p>
<p class="bas indent2"><span class="nm">2.</span>We know that Chachamim exempt when the Nezakav fell b'Ones. They could admit that he is liable when there was no Ones.</p>
<p class="bas indent1"><span class="nm">(h)</span>The following shows that R. Elazar obligates:</p>
<p class="bas indent2"><span class="nm">1.</span><span class="cl">(R. Elazar, citing R. Yishmael):</span> There are two things that one does not own, but the Torah obligates him for them as if he owned them: a pit in the Reshus ha'Rabim, and Chametz from noon of Erev Pesach and onwards.</p>
<p class="bas indent1"><span class="nm">(i)</span><span class="cl">Question:</span> R. Elazar does not obligate!</p>
<p class="bas indent2"><span class="nm">1.</span><span class="cl">(Mishnah):</span> If Reuven turned over dung in the Reshus ha'Rabim, and Shimon was damaged by it, Reuven is liable.</p>
<p class="bas indent2"><span class="nm">2.</span><span class="cl">(R. Elazar):</span> This applies only when Reuven intended to acquire the dung. If not, he is exempt.</p>
<p class="bas indent3"><span class="nm">i.</span>This shows that R. Elazar exempts one who makes Nezakav Hefker!</p>
<p class="bas indent1"><span class="nm">(j)</span><span class="cl">Answer #1 (Rav Ada bar Ahavah):</span> R. Elazar exempts when he returned the dung to its place.</p>
<p class="bas indent1"><span class="nm">(k)</span><span class="cl">(Ravina):</span> A parable helps to understand Rav Ada's case. This is like one who finds an open pit, covers it, and again opens it (he is exempt).</p>
<p class="bas indent1"><span class="nm">(l)</span><span class="cl">Objection (Mar Zutra brei d'Rav Mari):</span> The comparison is faulty! Regarding the pit, he never removed the damager. Regarding the dung, he removed the damager (when it was in his shovel; when he puts it back, he (re- )creates a damager).</p>
<p class="bas indent1"><span class="nm">(m)</span><span class="cl">(Mar Zutra brei d'Rav Mari):</span> This is a proper parable. It is like one who finds an open pit, fills it with dirt, and again digs it. (He is liable, since he created a damaging item.)</p>
<p class="bas indent1"><span class="nm">(n)</span><span class="cl">Answer #2 (Rav Ashi):</span> He did not lift the dung three Tefachim (so it was always a damager).</p>
<p class="bas indent1"><span class="nm">(o)</span><span class="cl">Question:</span> What forced R. Elazar to say that the Mishnah is a case when he did not lift the dung three Tefachim, and he is liable because he intended to acquire it? Let him say that he lifted it more than three Tefachim, and he is liable even if he did not intend to acquire!</p>
<p class="bas indent1"><span class="nm">(p)</span><span class="cl">Answer (Rava):</span> He saw a difficulty in the Mishnah. Why did it say 'he turned over', and not 'he lifted'?</p>
<p class="bas indent2"><span class="nm">1.</span>He concluded that 'he turned over' connotes that he did not lift it three Tefachim.</p>
<p class="bas subject"><span class="nm">3)</span>R. YOCHANAN'S OPINION</p>
<p class="bas indent1"><span class="nm">(a)</span><span class="cl">Inference:</span> Since R. Elazar obligates, it must be that R. Yochanan exempts.</p>
<p class="bas indent1"><span class="nm">(b)</span><span class="cl">Question:</span> This is not so!</p>
<p class="bas indent2"><span class="nm">1.</span><span class="cl">(Mishnah):</span> If Reuven hid a thorn or glass, or made a fence of thorns, or his wall fell in the Reshus ha'Rabim, and people were damaged by it, he is liable.</p>
<p class="bas indent2"><span class="nm">2.</span><span class="cl">(R. Yochanan):</span> This is only if the fence of thorns protruded into the Reshus ha'Rabim. If it was within his property, he is exempt.</p>
<p class="bas indent2"><span class="nm">3.</span><span class="cl">Suggestion:</span> If it was within his property, he is exempt because it is like a pit within his property.</p>
<p class="bas indent2"><span class="nm">4.</span><span class="cl">Inference:</span> He holds that the pit that the Torah obligates for is in the Reshus ha'Rabim, even though such a pit is Hefker!</p>
<p class="bas indent1"><span class="nm">(c)</span><span class="cl">Answer:</span> No. Really, R. Yochanan exempts one who is Mafkir Nezakav;</p>
<p class="bas indent2"><span class="nm">1.</span>The reason he is exempt if the thorn was within his property, is like Rav Acha taught.</p>
<p class="bas indent2"><span class="nm">2.</span><span class="cl">(Rav Acha brei d'Rav Ika):</span> He is exempt because people do not normally scrape themselves on walls (the victim brought the damage on himself by acting abnormally).</p>
<p class="bas indent1"><span class="nm">(d)</span><span class="cl">Question:</span> R. Yochanan does not exempt one who is Mafkir Nezakav! R. Yochanan said that the Halachah follows a Stam (anonymous) Mishnah!</p>
<p class="bas indent2"><span class="nm">1.</span><span class="cl">(Mishnah):</span> If one dug a pit in the Reshus ha'Rabim, and an ox or donkey fell in and died, he is liable.</p>
<p class="bas indent1"><span class="nm">(e)</span><span class="cl">Answer:</span> Indeed, R. Yochanan obligates one who is Mafkir Nezakav.</p>
<p class="bas indent1"><span class="nm">(f)</span><span class="cl">Inference:</span> R. Elazar exempts.</p>
<p class="bas indent1"><span class="nm">(g)</span><span class="cl">Question:</span> R. Elazar cited R. Yishmael to say that one is liable!</p>
<p class="bas indent1"><span class="nm">(h)</span><span class="cl">Answer:</span> R. Elazar himself exempts.</p>
