<p class="bas subject"><span class="nm">1)</span>FOLLOWING THE MAJORITY</p>
<p class="bas indent1"><span class="nm">(a)</span><span class="cl">Support (for R. Chanina - Abaye - Mishnah):</span> If blood was found in the Prozdor (outer chamber of the womb), we are in doubt where it came from. We assume that it came from the Makor (inner chamber), and she is Tamei;</p>
<p class="bas indent2"><span class="nm">1.</span>Even though the Aliyah (upper chamber) is closer, we attribute it to the Prozdor because more blood comes from there.</p>
<p class="bas indent1"><span class="nm">(b)</span><span class="cl">Rejection (Rava):</span> There, the majority source is also more frequent. Surely we follow the majority in such a case (no one would argue with R. Chanina about this)!</p>
<p class="bas indent2"><span class="nm">1.</span><span class="cl">(R. Chiya):</span> If blood was found in a woman's Prozdor, she is considered definitely Teme'ah. She is liable if she entered the Mikdash, and we burn Terumah that she touches.</p>
<p class="bas indent1"><span class="nm">(c)</span><span class="cl">(Rava):</span> We learn three things from R. Chiya's law.</p>
<p class="bas indent2"><span class="nm">1.</span>When in doubt about where something came from, we assume that it came from the majority, even if the minority is closer;</p>
<p class="bas indent2"><span class="nm">2.</span>Mid'Oraisa, we follow the majority;</p>
<p class="bas indent2"><span class="nm">3.</span>R. Zeira's law is correct.</p>
<p class="bas indent3"><span class="nm">i.</span><span class="cl">(R. Zeira):</span> We follow even a single majority. (E.g. if meat was found in a city, if most of the butchers sell Kosher meat, and the city doors are locked, it is permitted. We do not require a second majority, i.e. that it could have come from travelers, and most of their meat is Kosher.)</p>
<p class="bas indent3"><span class="nm">ii.</span>Also in a woman, there is only one majority. There is no other place the blood could be from!</p>
<p class="bas indent1"><span class="nm">(d)</span><span class="cl">Version #1A - Rashi - Question:</span> Above, Rava said that when the majority source is more frequent, all agree that we follow the majority, but here he says that R. Chiya supports R. Chanina!</p>
<p class="bas indent1"><span class="nm">(e)</span><span class="cl">Version #1B - Maharam (in Tosfos) - Question:</span> Above, Rava said that blood from the Aliyah (the majority source) is more frequent (for if not, R. Chanina would not have taught his law, it follows from R. Chiya's law), but here he says that R. Chiya is a support for R. Chanina!</p>
<p class="bas indent1"><span class="nm">(f)</span><span class="cl">Answer:</span> Rava retracted. R. Chiya does not support R. Chanina.</p>
<p class="bas indent1"><span class="nm">(g)</span><span class="cl">Version #2 (R. Gershom) Question:</span> Above, Rava said that we follow the majority source only if it is more frequent. Here, he says that we follow any majority!</p>
<p class="bas indent1"><span class="nm">(h)</span><span class="cl">Answer:</span> Rava retracted from what he said above. (end of Version #2)</p>
<p class="bas indent1"><span class="nm">(i)</span><span class="cl">(Rav):</span> If a barrel (of wine) floating in a river was found near a city that is mostly Yisraelim, it is permitted. If the nearest city is mostly Nochrim, it is forbidden;</p>
<p class="bas indent1"><span class="nm">(j)</span><span class="cl">(Shmuel):</span> Even if it was found near a city that is mostly Yisraelim, it is forbidden. Perhaps it came from Ihi Dekira (a Nochri city upstream in Bavel).</p>
<p class="bas indent1"><span class="nm">(k)</span><span class="cl">Suggestion:</span> They argue about R. Chanina's law. Shmuel follows the majority like R. Chanina, and Rav argues and assumes that it came from the closest.</p>
<p class="bas indent1"><span class="nm">(l)</span>Rejection No, all agree with R. Chanina;</p>
<p class="bas indent2"><span class="nm">1.</span>Rav says that it could not have come from Ihi Dekira, for it would have broken on rocks in the river;</p>
<p class="bas indent2"><span class="nm">2.</span>Shmuel says that perhaps it floated in the middle of the river, where there are no rocks.</p>
<p class="bas indent1"><span class="nm">(m)</span>A barrel of wine (was presumably stolen and) was found in an orchard of Orlah. Ravina permitted it (we assume that it came from elsewhere. Most fruit in the world is not Orlah.)</p>
<p class="bas indent1"><span class="nm">(n)</span><span class="cl">Suggestion:</span> Ravina holds like R. Chanina.</p>
<p class="bas indent1"><span class="nm">(o)</span><span class="cl">Rejection:</span> No. He permitted in this case only because a thief would not hide wine in the place he stole the grapes (lest they see him stomp them).</p>
<p class="bas indent2"><span class="nm">1.</span>This refers only to wine, but he would hide the grapes there.</p>
<p class="bas indent1"><span class="nm">(p)</span>Jugs of wine were found hidden among vines in Reuven's vineyard. Rava permitted them.</p>
<p class="bas indent1"><span class="nm">(q)</span><span class="cl">Suggestion:</span> Rava argues with R. Chanina. (Rava assumes that they were stolen from Reuven, the closest possible source, and not the majority.)</p>
<p class="bas indent1"><span class="nm">(r)</span><span class="cl">Rejection:</span> No. Here is different, for most of the vendors (in the entire region) selling jugs of wine are Yisrael.</p>
<p class="bas bbbline">24b----------------------------------------24b</p>
<p class="bas indent2"><span class="nm">1.</span>This applies only to large jugs, but small jugs are forbidden. Perhaps they fell from travelers (who may have come from far away. The majority of them are Nochrim.)</p>
<p class="bas indent2"><span class="nm">2.</span>If large and small jugs are found together, all are permitted;</p>
<p class="bas indent3"><span class="nm">i.</span>Travelers do not carry large jugs. Even though merchants do not need small jugs, they often use them  to balance a load on the donkey.</p>
<p class="bas subject"><span class="nm">2)</span>A TREE NEAR A CITY</p>
<p class="bas indent1"><span class="nm">(a)</span><span class="cl">(Mishnah):</span> We distance a tree 25 Amos from a city. A carob or sycamore tree must be distanced 50 Amos;</p>
<p class="bas indent1"><span class="nm">(b)</span>Aba Sha'ul says, any barren tree must be distanced 50 Amos;</p>
<p class="bas indent2"><span class="nm">1.</span>If the city was there first, we (people of the city) may cut it, we need not pay the owner;</p>
<p class="bas indent2"><span class="nm">2.</span>If the tree was there first, we may cut it, but we must pay.</p>
<p class="bas indent2"><span class="nm">3.</span>If we are unsure which came first, we may cut it, we need not pay.</p>
<p class="bas indent1"><span class="nm">(c)</span><span class="cl">(Gemara) Question:</span> Why must trees be distanced?</p>
<p class="bas indent1"><span class="nm">(d)</span><span class="cl">Answer (Ula):</span> It is for the beauty of the city.</p>
<p class="bas indent1"><span class="nm">(e)</span><span class="cl">Question:</span> Even more should be forbidden! We may not convert a Migrash (1000 Amos surrounding a city in each direction) into a field, or vice-versa!</p>
<p class="bas indent1"><span class="nm">(f)</span><span class="cl">Answer #1:</span> The Mishnah is R. Eliezer, who permits converting a Migrash into a field, or vice-versa;</p>
<p class="bas indent2"><span class="nm">1.</span>Twenty-five Amos are forbidden due to beauty of the city.</p>
<p class="bas indent1"><span class="nm">(g)</span><span class="cl">Answer #2:</span> Even Chachamim, who say that we may not convert a Migrash into a field or vice-versa, forbid only a seeded field, but we may plant trees;</p>
<p class="bas indent2"><span class="nm">1.</span>Twenty-five Amos are forbidden due to beauty of the city.</p>
<p class="bas indent1"><span class="nm">(h)</span><span class="cl">Question:</span> What is the source to distinguish between a seeded field and trees?</p>
<p class="bas indent1"><span class="nm">(i)</span><span class="cl">Answer (Beraisa):</span> If a Karfaf (an unroofed enclosed area) more than the area in which one seeds two Se'ah was enclosed for dwelling: if the majority was seeded, it is like a garden, and one may not carry in it on Shabbos;</p>
<p class="bas indent2"><span class="nm">1.</span>If the majority was planted (with trees), it is like a Chatzer, and one may carry in it.</p>
<p class="bas indent1"><span class="nm">(j)</span><span class="cl">(Mishnah):</span> If the city was there first, we (people of the city) may cut it, we need not pay the owner.</p>
<p class="bas indent1"><span class="nm">(k)</span><span class="cl">Question:</span> If a tree is near a pit, the owner of the pit may cut it and pay the owner (25b); if a tree is near a city, we (the city residents) may cut it and do not pay the owner;</p>
<p class="bas indent2"><span class="nm">1.</span>Why are the laws different?</p>
<p class="bas indent1"><span class="nm">(l)</span><span class="cl">Answer (Rav Kahana):</span> An individual will pay (for the tree) for the sake of his pit;</p>
<p class="bas indent2"><span class="nm">1.</span>There are many people in the city, no one wants to pay first. (If we cannot cut it without paying, it will not be cut.)</p>
<p class="bas indent1"><span class="nm">(m)</span><span class="cl">Objection:</span> Why was the question asked? Damage to the public is worse than damage to an individual!</p>
<p class="bas indent1"><span class="nm">(n)</span><span class="cl">Correction:</span> Rather, Rav Kahana replied to a question on the Seifa.</p>
<p class="bas indent1"><span class="nm">(o)</span><span class="cl">(Mishnah):</span> If the tree was there first, we may cut it, we must pay.</p>
<p class="bas indent1"><span class="nm">(p)</span><span class="cl">Question:</span> Why can't the owner demand to be paid before they cut the tree?</p>
<p class="bas indent1"><span class="nm">(q)</span><span class="cl">Answer (Rav Kahana):</span> It will be a long time before the money is collected. (After we cut, the owner can go to Beis Din to demand compensation.)</p>
<p class="bas indent1"><span class="nm">(r)</span><span class="cl">(Mishnah):</span> If we are unsure which came first, we may cut it, we need not pay.</p>
<p class="bas indent1"><span class="nm">(s)</span><span class="cl">Question:</span> What is the difference between the case of a tree near a pit (he may not cut when in doubt) and our case (when in doubt, we cut)?</p>
<p class="bas indent1"><span class="nm">(t)</span><span class="cl">Answer:</span> If the tree preceded the pit, it should not be cut. When in doubt, we do not cut;</p>
<p class="bas indent2"><span class="nm">1.</span>Here, either way the tree should be cut, so we may cut it;</p>
<p class="bas indent2"><span class="nm">2.</span>We are in doubt if we must pay for it. To collect money, the owner must bring proof.</p>
<p class="bas subject"><span class="nm">3)</span>DISTANCING A GRANARY</p>
<p class="bas indent1"><span class="nm">(a)</span><span class="cl">(Mishnah):</span> We distance a fixed granary 50 Amos from a city;</p>
<p class="bas indent1"><span class="nm">(b)</span>One may not make a fixed granary on his property unless he owns 50 Amos around it in each direction.</p>
<p class="bas indent2"><span class="nm">1.</span>He must distance it from his neighbor's saplings and Nir (plowed, unseeded field) so it will not damage them.</p>
<p class="bas indent1"><span class="nm">(c)</span><span class="cl">(Gemara) Question:</span> Why is the law different in the last case (50 Amos are not required)?</p>
<p class="bas indent1"><span class="nm">(d)</span><span class="cl">Answer #1 (Abaye):</span> It discusses a granary that is not fixed.</p>
<p class="bas indent2"><span class="nm">1.</span><span class="cl">Question:</span> What is the case of a granary that is not fixed?</p>
<p class="bas indent2"><span class="nm">2.</span><span class="cl">Answer (R. Yosi b'Rebbi Chanina):</span> There is so little grain that the wind winnows it itself. One need not throw it with a pitchfork.</p>
<p class="bas indent1"><span class="nm">(e)</span><span class="cl">Answer #2 (Rav Ashi):</span> Fifty Amos are required; the Seifa explains the Reisha:</p>
<p class="bas indent2"><span class="nm">1.</span>We distance a fixed granary 50 Amos from a city in order that it will not damage.</p>
<p class="bas indent1"><span class="nm">(f)</span><span class="cl">Question (against Abaye - Beraisa):</span> We distance a fixed granary 50 Amos from a city;</p>
<p class="bas indent2"><span class="nm">1.</span>We keep the same distance from gourds, saplings and a Nir.</p>
<p class="bas indent2"><span class="nm">2.</span>This is left difficult.</p>
<p class="bas indent1"><span class="nm">(g)</span>We understand how the granary hurts gourds. The dust enters the buds and dries them.</p>
<p class="bas indent1"><span class="nm">(h)</span><span class="cl">Question:</span> How does it harm a Nir?</p>
<p class="bas indent1"><span class="nm">(i)</span><span class="cl">Answer (R. Aba bar Zavda):</span> It overfertilizes it (this burns the seeds).</p>
