<p class="bas subject"><span class="nm">1)</span>DIVORCE DUE TO ILL REPUTE</p>
<p class="bas indent1"><span class="nm">(a)</span><span class="cl">(Gemara - Rav Yosef bar Minyomi) Version #1:</span> He may not remarry her only if he told her 'I divorce you because of your ill repute' or '...because of the vow'.</p>
<p class="bas indent2"><span class="nm">1.</span>He holds that the reason is lest she get ruined. (After she remarries, he will say 'I would not have divorced you had I known that the ill repute was unfounded' or '... that the vow could have been permitted. Your Get is Pasul.')</p>
<p class="bas indent2"><span class="nm">2.</span>He can ruin her only if when he divorced her, he told her the reason.</p>
<p class="bas indent1"><span class="nm">(b)</span><span class="cl">Version #2:</span> He must tell his wife that he divorces her due to her ill repute or the vow.</p>
<p class="bas indent2"><span class="nm">1.</span>He holds that the Isur to remarry is to discourage Benos Yisrael from looseness about Arayos (sexual immorality) and vows.</p>
<p class="bas indent1"><span class="nm">(c)</span><span class="cl">Support (for Version #1 - Beraisa - R. Meir):</span> One who divorces his wife due to her ill repute may never remarry her, lest she marry another man, and it will become clear that she was innocent. He will say 'had I known this, I would not have divorced her, even to receive 100 Maneh (a fortune)!'</p>
<p class="bas indent2"><span class="nm">1.</span>Therefore, we tell him that he can never remarry her. (If he still divorces her, it is clear that he has no desire to keep her.)</p>
<p class="bas indent1"><span class="nm">(d)</span><span class="cl">Support (for Version #2 - Beraisa - R. Elazar b'Rebbi Yosi):</span> One who divorces his wife because of ill repute or a vow must tell her so at the time of divorce.</p>
<p class="bas indent2"><span class="nm">1.</span>The Isur to remarry is to discourage Benos Yisrael from looseness about Arayos and vows. Therefore, he must tell her.</p>
<p class="bas subject"><span class="nm">2)</span>WHICH VOWS CAN BE PERMITTED</p>
<p class="bas indent1"><span class="nm">(a)</span><span class="cl">(Mishnah):</span> R. Yehudah says, if many knew about the vow, he may not remarry her. If not, he may.</p>
<p class="bas indent1"><span class="nm">(b)</span><span class="cl">(R. Yehoshua ben Levi):</span> R. Yehudah learns from "Bnei Yisrael did not kill (the Giv'onim) because the heads of the tribes had sworn to them." (Because they swore in public, they could not permit the oath.)</p>
<p class="bas indent2"><span class="nm">1.</span>Chachamim hold that the oath did not take effect at all, since they were deceived. The Giv'onim said that they came from a distant land, and this was false;</p>
<p class="bas indent2"><span class="nm">2.</span>They did not kill them due to the Kedushah of Hash-m's name (lest people say that they transgressed their oath).</p>
<p class="bas indent1"><span class="nm">(c)</span><span class="cl">Question:</span> What is considered many people (knowing about the vow)?</p>
<p class="bas indent1"><span class="nm">(d)</span><span class="cl">Answer #1 (Rav Nachman):</span> It is three.</p>
<p class="bas indent1"><span class="nm">(e)</span><span class="cl">Answer #2 (R. Yitzchak):</span> It is 10.</p>
<p class="bas indent2"><span class="nm">1.</span>Rav Nachman learns from "many days" (in the Parshah of a woman who sees Zivah, i.e. post-menstrual bleeding). "Days" teaches two. "Many" teaches a third day;</p>
<p class="bas indent2"><span class="nm">2.</span>R. Yitzchak learns from "Edah (congregation)" mentioned regarding the oath of the heads of the tribes. An Edah is at least 10 (we learn from the Edah of wicked Meraglim. There were 10 of them.)</p>
<p class="bas indent1"><span class="nm">(f)</span><span class="cl">(Mishnah):</span> R. Meir says, if the vow required a Chacham...</p>
<p class="bas indent1"><span class="nm">(g)</span><span class="cl">(Beraisa - R. Elazar):</span> We were stringent about a vow that requires a Chacham only due to a vow that does not require a Chacham.</p>
<p class="bas indent1"><span class="nm">(h)</span><span class="cl">Question:</span> What do they argue about?</p>
<p class="bas indent1"><span class="nm">(i)</span><span class="cl">Answer:</span> R. Meir holds that a man does not mind if his wife is disgraced (by needing to appear) in Beis Din. (Had he known that her vow could be permitted in Beis Din, he would not have divorced her);</p>
<p class="bas indent1"><span class="nm">(j)</span>R. Elazar holds that a man does not want his wife to be disgraced in Beis Din. (He would have divorced her even if he knew that her vow could be permitted in Beis Din.)</p>
<p class="bas subject"><span class="nm">3)</span>WHEN HE MAY REMARRY HER</p>
<p class="bas indent1"><span class="nm">(a)</span><span class="cl">(Mishnah):</span> R. Yosi b'Rebbi Yehudah says, a case occurred in Tzidon...</p>
<p class="bas indent1"><span class="nm">(b)</span><span class="cl">Question:</span> What law of the Mishnah does this illustrate?</p>
<p class="bas indent1"><span class="nm">(c)</span><span class="cl">Answer:</span> The Mishnah is abbreviated; it means as follows: the Isur to remarry applies only when he divorced her because of her vow. If he vowed, he may remarry her;</p>
<p class="bas indent2"><span class="nm">1.</span>R. Yosi b'Rebbi Yehudah says, a case occurred in Tzidon in which Reuven said 'if I do not divorce my wife, (something) will be forbidden like a Korban', and divorced her. Chachamim permitted him to remarry her, for Tikun ha'Olam.</p>
<p class="bas bbbline">46b----------------------------------------46b</p>
<p class="bas indent2"><span class="nm">2.</span><span class="cl">Question:</span> What did he forbid?</p>
<p class="bas indent2"><span class="nm">3.</span><span class="cl">Answer (Rav Huna):</span> He said 'all produce is forbidden to me if I do not divorce you.'</p>
<p class="bas indent1"><span class="nm">(d)</span><span class="cl">(Mishnah):</span> Chachamim permitted him to remarry her...</p>
<p class="bas indent1"><span class="nm">(e)</span><span class="cl">Question:</span> This is obvious! (There is no concern!)</p>
<p class="bas indent1"><span class="nm">(f)</span><span class="cl">Answer:</span> One might have thought that we should decree due to R. Nasan:</p>
<p class="bas indent2"><span class="nm">1.</span><span class="cl">(Beraisa - R. Nasan):</span> One who vows is like one who builds a Bamah (private Mizbe'ach, when this is forbidden). Fulfilling the vow (i.e. not permitting it) is like offering on his Bamah.</p>
<p class="bas indent2"><span class="nm">2.</span>The Mishnah teaches that we do not decree. (Rather, he may remarry her.)</p>
<p class="bas indent1"><span class="nm">(g)</span><span class="cl">(Mishnah):</span> ...For Tikun ha'Olam.</p>
<p class="bas indent1"><span class="nm">(h)</span><span class="cl">Question:</span> How does this fix things?</p>
<p class="bas indent1"><span class="nm">(i)</span><span class="cl">Answer #1 (Rav Sheshes):</span> This phrase applies to the Reisha (when he may not remarry her).</p>
<p class="bas indent1"><span class="nm">(j)</span><span class="cl">Answer #2 (Ravina):</span> It refers to the Seifa. It means, in this case there was no need to decree for Tikun ha'Olam.</p>
<p class="bas subject"><span class="nm">4)</span>DIVORCING AN <i>AILONIS</i></p>
<p class="bas indent1"><span class="nm">(a)</span><span class="cl">(Mishnah - R. Yehudah):</span> If Reuven divorced his wife because she is an Ailonis (a female who does not develop like a normal female; she cannot conceive), he may never remarry her;</p>
<p class="bas indent1"><span class="nm">(b)</span>Chachamim say, he may remarry her.</p>
<p class="bas indent1"><span class="nm">(c)</span>R. Yehudah says, if she married someone else and had children, and demands that Reuven pay her a Kesuvah, we tell her 'it is better for you to keep quiet!'</p>
<p class="bas indent1"><span class="nm">(d)</span><span class="cl">(Gemara) Inference:</span> R. Yehudah is concerned for her ruin, and Chachamim are not.</p>
<p class="bas indent1"><span class="nm">(e)</span><span class="cl">Contradiction (Mishnah):</span> If Reuven divorced his wife due to her ill repute, or because of a vow, he may never remarry her;</p>
<p class="bas indent2"><span class="nm">1.</span>R. Yehudah says, if many knew about the vow, he may not remarry her. If not, he may.</p>
<p class="bas indent2"><span class="nm">2.</span>This shows that Chachamim are concerned, and R. Yehudah is not!</p>
<p class="bas indent1"><span class="nm">(f)</span><span class="cl">Answer #1 (Shmuel):</span> The opinions in our Mishnah should be switched.</p>
<p class="bas indent2"><span class="nm">1.</span><span class="cl">Question (Seifa - R. Yehudah):</span> If she married David and had children from him and demands that Reuven pay her a Kesuvah, we tell her 'it is better for you to keep quiet!' (If you complain, Reuven might say that your divorce was due to a mistake (really, you are not an Ailonis) and is invalid. You were forbidden to David, and your children are Mamzerim!)</p>
<p class="bas indent3"><span class="nm">i.</span>This shows that R. Yehudah is concerned for her ruin!</p>
<p class="bas indent2"><span class="nm">2.</span><span class="cl">Answer:</span> That also is switched to be the words of Chachamim.</p>
<p class="bas indent1"><span class="nm">(g)</span><span class="cl">Answer #2 (Abaye):</span> The opinions need not be switched.</p>
<p class="bas indent2"><span class="nm">1.</span>In the Mishnah about a vow, R. Yehudah holds like R. Meir and like R. Elazar.</p>
<p class="bas indent2"><span class="nm">2.</span>He holds like R. Elazar regarding a vow that needs a Chacham (a man does not want his wife to be disgraced in Beis Din), and like R. Meir regarding a vow that does not need a Chacham (her husband could have annulled it. Since he did not, this was not the reason he divorced her.)</p>
<p class="bas indent1"><span class="nm">(h)</span><span class="cl">Objection (Rava):</span> This answers the contradiction in R. Yehudah. It does not answer for Chachamim!</p>
<p class="bas indent1"><span class="nm">(i)</span><span class="cl">Completion of Answer #2 (Rava):</span> Chachamim in our Mishnah hold like R. Meir, who says that a Tanai is invalid unless it is doubled (if this, then...; if not, then...).</p>
<p class="bas indent2"><span class="nm">1.</span>The case is, he did not double the Tanai (and say 'if you are not an Ailonis, I do not divorce you'), so there is no possibility of ruin.</p>
<p class="bas subject"><span class="nm">5)</span>ONE WHO SOLD HIMSELF</p>
<p class="bas indent1"><span class="nm">(a)</span><span class="cl">(Mishnah):</span> If Reuven sold himself and his children to Nochrim, we do not redeem Reuven, but we redeem his children after he dies.</p>
<p class="bas indent1"><span class="nm">(b)</span><span class="cl">(Gemara - Rav Asi):</span> The case is, he sold himself three times.</p>
<p class="bas indent1"><span class="nm">(c)</span>People of Bei Michsi used to borrow money from Nochrim. When they could not pay back, the lenders took the borrowers for slaves.</p>
<p class="bas indent2"><span class="nm">1.</span><span class="cl">Rav Huna:</span> The Mishnah says that we do not redeem one who sells himself!</p>
<p class="bas indent2"><span class="nm">2.</span><span class="cl">R. Aba:</span> You taught us that is only when he sold himself three times!</p>
<p class="bas indent2"><span class="nm">3.</span><span class="cl">Rav Huna:</span> These people are used to this. (It is as if they did it three times.)</p>
