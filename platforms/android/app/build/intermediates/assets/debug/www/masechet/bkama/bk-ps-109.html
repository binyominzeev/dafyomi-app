<p class="dedicationbox">BAVA KAMA 109 (14 Elul) - This Daf has been dedicated in honor of the Yahrzeit of Yisrael (son of Chazkel and Miryam) Rosenbaum, who passed away on 14 Elul, by his son and daughter and families. </p>

<p class="bas subject"><span class="nm">1)</span>THINGS THAT ONE MUST GIVE AWAY</p>
<p class="bas indent1"><span class="nm">(a)</span><span class="cl">(Continuation of Mishnah #1):</span> (Even) if Shimon told his son David 'my property is Konam (like a Korban, which one may not benefit from) to you'; David inherits him;</p>
<p class="bas indent2"><span class="nm">1.</span>If he said 'my property is Konam to you in my life and after death', David does not inherit him. His portion reverts to his (father's or own) sons or brothers;</p>
<p class="bas indent2"><span class="nm">2.</span>If David does not want (or cannot afford) to lose his portion, he borrows this quantity, and the creditors collect it from his share of the inheritance.</p>
<p class="bas indent1"><span class="nm">(b)</span><span class="cl">(Gemara - Rav Yosef):</span> (If one stole from his father, and he knows of no other heirs to give it to,) he must get rid of the theft. He may even put it in the Tzedakah box.</p>
<p class="bas indent1"><span class="nm">(c)</span><span class="cl">(Rav Papa):</span> He must say 'this is what I stole from my father.'</p>
<p class="bas indent1"><span class="nm">(d)</span><span class="cl">Question:</span> Why can't he keep the money (if he is the sole heir)? He can pardon himself!</p>
<p class="bas indent2"><span class="nm">1.</span><span class="cl">(Mishnah #2):</span> If the owner pardoned the thief from paying the principal, but not from the Chomesh (the thief need not travel to return what he owes).</p>
<p class="bas indent2"><span class="nm">2.</span>This shows that the theft can be pardoned!</p>
<p class="bas indent1"><span class="nm">(e)</span><span class="cl">Answer #1 (R. Yochanan):</span> Mishnah #2 is like R. Yosi ha'Glili, who holds that theft can be pardoned. Mishnah #1 is like R. Akiva, who holds that it cannot be pardoned.</p>
<p class="bas indent2"><span class="nm">1.</span><span class="cl">(Beraisa - R. Yosi ha'Glili) Question:</span> Why does it say "if the man has no redeemer (heir) to whom to return the theft"? Every Yisrael has heirs!</p>
<p class="bas indent2"><span class="nm">2.</span><span class="cl">Answer:</span> Rather, the verse discusses a convert;</p>
<p class="bas indent3"><span class="nm">i.</span>Reuven stole from a convert and swore falsely to him. He heard (a false report) that the convert died. He wanted to repent. He was taking the money (to give to the Kohanim) and his Asham to Yerushalayim; he met the convert on the way. The convert agreed that the theft should be like a loan. The convert died; Reuven keeps the money.</p>
<p class="bas indent2"><span class="nm">3.</span>R. Akiva says, he may not keep the theft.</p>
<p class="bas indent2"><span class="nm">4.</span><span class="cl">Summation of answer:</span> R. Yosi (ha'Glili) holds that theft can be pardoned, and R. Akiva holds that it cannot. Neither distinguishes between pardoning oneself or another person. 5.  Really, R. Yosi holds that Reuven keeps it even if the convert never made it a loan. The Beraisa discusses when he made it a loan to teach the extremity of R. Akiva's opinion, that even if he made it a loan, Reuven cannot keep it.</p>
<p class="bas indent1"><span class="nm">(f)</span><span class="cl">Question (Rav Sheshes):</span> If so, R. Yosi should teach that a thief can pardon himself, and all the more so we would know that one can pardon another, and R. Akiva should teach that one cannot pardon another, and all the more so one cannot pardon himself!</p>
<p class="bas indent1"><span class="nm">(g)</span><span class="cl">Answer #2 (Rav Sheshes):</span> Both Mishnayos are like R. Yosi. One can pardon only another, but he cannot pardon himself.</p>
<p class="bas indent2"><span class="nm">1.</span><span class="cl">Question:</span> If so, why can the thief keep the money (in the Beraisa)?</p>
<p class="bas indent2"><span class="nm">2.</span><span class="cl">Answer:</span> It was converted to a loan.</p>
<p class="bas indent1"><span class="nm">(h)</span><span class="cl">Answer #3 (Rabah):</span> Both Mishnayos are like R. Akiva. One cannot pardon himself, but he can pardon others.</p>
<p class="bas bbbline">109b----------------------------------------109b</p>
<p class="bas indent1"><span class="nm">(i)</span><span class="cl">Inference:</span> R. Yosi holds that one can pardon even himself!</p>
<p class="bas indent1"><span class="nm">(j)</span><span class="cl">Question:</span> If so, when did the Torah obligate to give Gezel ha'Ger (what was stolen from a convert who later died without heirs) to Kohanim? (He can pardon himself!)</p>
<p class="bas indent1"><span class="nm">(k)</span><span class="cl">Answer (Rava):</span> The case is, he stole from and swore falsely to a convert, then confessed after the convert died. When he confesses, the theft is acquired to Hash-m, i.e. it must be given to Kohanim.</p>
<p class="bas subject"><span class="nm">2)</span>GEZEL HA'GER</p>
<p class="bas indent1"><span class="nm">(a)</span><span class="cl">Question (Ravina):</span> If Reuven stole from a female convert (and she died), what is the law?</p>
<p class="bas indent2"><span class="nm">1.</span>It says "(if the) man (who was robbed has no heirs)" - the law applies only to a man;</p>
<p class="bas indent2"><span class="nm">2.</span>Or, perhaps the Torah normally speaks this way (it does not come to exclude women)?</p>
<p class="bas indent1"><span class="nm">(b)</span><span class="cl">Answer (Rav Aharon - Beraisa) Question:</span> Perhaps Gezel ha'Ger applies only to (stealing from) a "man (convert)". What is the source to include even from a female?</p>
<p class="bas indent2"><span class="nm">1.</span><span class="cl">Version #1 - Answer:</span> "To return (the theft...) that is returned" - the Torah discusses two returnings (to male and female converts).</p>
<p class="bas indent2"><span class="nm">2.</span><span class="cl">Version #2 - Answer:</span> "(To return the theft to him, the theft) that is returned" - the Torah discusses two thefts.</p>
<p class="bas indent2"><span class="nm">3.</span><span class="cl">Question:</span> If so, why does it say "man"?</p>
<p class="bas indent2"><span class="nm">4.</span><span class="cl">Answer:</span> Regarding a man, you must investigate whether or not he has heirs (children). A minor surely has no children.</p>
<p class="bas indent1"><span class="nm">(c)</span><span class="cl">(Beraisa):</span> "To Hash-m, to the Kohen" - Hash-m acquires the theft and gives it to a Kohen of the division serving that week (when the thief returns it).</p>
<p class="bas indent2"><span class="nm">1.</span><span class="cl">Suggestion:</span> Perhaps the thief may give it to any Kohen he wants!</p>
<p class="bas indent2"><span class="nm">2.</span><span class="cl">Rejection:</span> "Except for the ram of atonement with which he will atone for him" - the Torah discusses a Kohen in that division (who could offer the Asham).</p>
<p class="bas indent1"><span class="nm">(d)</span><span class="cl">(Beraisa) Question:</span> If a Kohen stole from a convert, what is the source that he cannot say 'since I am a Kohen, I may keep it'?</p>
<p class="bas indent2"><span class="nm">1.</span>A Kal va'Chomer should teach that he may keep it!</p>
<p class="bas indent2"><span class="nm">2.</span><span class="cl">Version #1:</span> A Kohen receives what others stole. All the more so, he should keep what he stole!</p>
<p class="bas indent2"><span class="nm">3.</span><span class="cl">Version #2A (Rashi - R. Nasan):</span> Initially, a Kohen (Reuven) has no stake in the Korban of another Kohen (Shimon; Shimon may offer it himself if he wants), until it comes to Reuven;</p>
<p class="bas indent3"><span class="nm">i.</span>If Shimon gave it to Reuven to offer, he cannot take it back;</p>
<p class="bas indent2"><span class="nm">4.</span><span class="cl">Version #2B (Rashi - R. Nasan):</span> Initially, a Kohen (Reuven) has no share in Terumah until the owner of the produce gives it to him;</p>
<p class="bas indent3"><span class="nm">i.</span>Once he receives them, he keeps them; (end of Version #2)</p>
<p class="bas indent2"><span class="nm">5.</span>Reuven has a share in Gezel ha'Ger even before it comes to Reuven (i.e. if it was given to a Kohen of Reuven's division). All the more so, once he has it (i.e. what he himself stole), no one should be able to take it from him!</p>
<p class="bas indent1"><span class="nm">(e)</span><span class="cl">Answer:</span> The Kal va'Chomer is faulty!</p>
<p class="bas indent2"><span class="nm">1.</span>In the source (what a Yisrael stole from a convert, or a Kohen's Korban, or Terumah) just like Reuven initially has no share, also other Kohanim initially have no share;</p>
<p class="bas indent2"><span class="nm">2.</span>But when Reuven stole from a convert, just like Reuven has a share, other Kohanim (of the division) also have a share!</p>
<p class="bas indent1"><span class="nm">(f)</span>Rather, all Kohanim (of the division) share Reuven's theft.</p>
<p class="bas indent1"><span class="nm">(g)</span><span class="cl">Question:</span> It says "a man's Kodoshav will be to him" (since a Kohen may offer his own Korbanos, he also gets (to keep) the theft)!</p>
<p class="bas indent1"><span class="nm">(h)</span><span class="cl">Answer #1:</span> The case is, Reuven is Tamei (since he cannot offer his own Korbanos, he does not get to keep the theft).</p>
<p class="bas indent1"><span class="nm">(i)</span><span class="cl">Rejection:</span> We said that he has a share. A Tamei Kohen has no share (in what was stolen from a convert)!</p>
<p class="bas indent1"><span class="nm">(j)</span><span class="cl">Answer #2:</span> We learn a Gezeirah Shavah "l'Kohen-l'Kohen" from an inherited field.</p>
<p class="bas indent2"><span class="nm">1.</span><span class="cl">(Beraisa) Question:</span> If Levi made his field Hekdesh, and Reuven (a Kohen) redeemed it, what is the source that Reuven cannot say 'since if one does not redeem his field before Yovel, it is divided among the Kohanim, and I am a Kohen, I may keep it? A Kal va'Chomer supports me!'</p>
<p class="bas indent3"><span class="nm">i.</span>A Kohen receives what he did not redeem. All the more so, he should keep what he redeemed!</p>
<p class="bas indent2"><span class="nm">2.</span><span class="cl">Answer:</span> "Like a Cherem field (that is given to Kohanim), it will be to the Kohen his inheritance" - this is not his inheritance;</p>
<p class="bas indent3"><span class="nm">i.</span>Rather, it is divided among all the Kohanim in Yovel.</p>
<p class="bas subject"><span class="nm">3)</span>A <i>KOHEN</i> MAY OFFER HIS OWN <i>KORBANOS</i></p>
<p class="bas indent1"><span class="nm">(a)</span><span class="cl">(Beraisa):</span> Question: What is the source that a Kohen can offer his own Korbanos whenever he wants?</p>
<p class="bas indent1"><span class="nm">(b)</span><span class="cl">Answer:</span> "He will come with all desire of his soul, and serve".</p>
<p class="bas indent1"><span class="nm">(c)</span><span class="cl">Question:</span> What is the source that (the reward for) offering it (the meat) and the skin are his?</p>
<p class="bas indent1"><span class="nm">(d)</span><span class="cl">Answer:</span> "A man's Kodoshav will be to him";</p>
<p class="bas indent2"><span class="nm">1.</span><span class="cl">Version #1:</span> If he is a blemished Kohen, he gives his Korbanos to a Kohen of the division. He himself gets the meat and skin.</p>
<p class="bas indent2"><span class="nm">2.</span><span class="cl">(Version #2:</span> If he is a blemished Kohen, he gives his Korbanos to Kohanim of the division, they get the meat and skin. (end of Version #2)</p>
<p class="bas indent2"><span class="nm">3.</span>If he is old or sick, he gives his Korbanos to any Kohen he wants. Kohanim of the division get the meat and skin.</p>
