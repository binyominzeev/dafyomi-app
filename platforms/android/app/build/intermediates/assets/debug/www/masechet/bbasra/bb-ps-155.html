<p class="bas indent1"><span class="nm">(a)</span><span class="cl">Rejection:</span> No, we need not;</p>
<p class="bas indent2"><span class="nm">1.</span>R. Yochanan asked 'according to me, the buyers must validate the document. We understand why the buyers started using the land (they validated it, or relied on the admission of the family that it was written);</p>
<p class="bas indent3"><span class="nm">i.</span>According to you, they must bring witnesses. They had no right to start using the land!'</p>
<p class="bas indent2"><span class="nm">2.</span>Reish Lakish answered 'I agree that the family has no claim (until they bring proof);</p>
<p class="bas indent3"><span class="nm">i.</span>They say that he was a minor. We have a Chazakah that witnesses do not sign unless the parties in the document are adults!'</p>
<p class="bas subject"><span class="nm">2)</span>SELLING THE FATHER'S PROPERTY</p>
<p class="bas indent1"><span class="nm">(a)</span><span class="cl">Question:</span> How old must one be to sell his father's property (land, that he inherited)?</p>
<p class="bas indent1"><span class="nm">(b)</span><span class="cl">Answer #1 (Rava citing Rav Nachman):</span> He must be 18 years old.</p>
<p class="bas indent1"><span class="nm">(c)</span><span class="cl">Answer #2 (Rav Huna bar Chinena citing Rav Nachman):</span> He must be 20 years old.</p>
<p class="bas indent1"><span class="nm">(d)</span><span class="cl">Question (R. Zeira - Beraisa):</span> A case occurred in which Reuven sold his father's property, and Reuven died. They (members of the family) said that the sale was invalid, for he was a minor at the time. They asked if they may check the body.</p>
<p class="bas indent2"><span class="nm">1.</span><span class="cl">R. Akiva:</span> Firstly, you may not check the body, for it is a disgrace. Secondly, signs often change after death.</p>
<p class="bas indent2"><span class="nm">2.</span>Granted, according to Rava, Reuven was 18. They thought that if they check and find no hairs, this proves that he was a minor;</p>
<p class="bas bbbline">155b----------------------------------------155b</p>
<p class="bas indent2"><span class="nm">3.</span>However, Rav Huna bar Chinena must say that Reuven was at least 20. Even without hairs, he is an adult!</p>
<p class="bas indent3"><span class="nm">i.</span><span class="cl">(Mishnah):</span> If a 20-year old did not bring hairs, he is <i>the</i> Seris (a man who does not develop like a normal male). He does not do Yibum or Chalitzah (even if he brings hairs later, for he is already an adult).</p>
<p class="bas indent1"><span class="nm">(e)</span><span class="cl">Answer:</span> Reuven did not have signs of a Seris, so if he had no hairs, he was a minor;</p>
<p class="bas indent2"><span class="nm">1.</span><span class="cl">(Rav Shmuel bar Rav Yitzchak):</span> The Mishnah says that he is (an adult and) a Seris at age 20 only if he has signs of a Seris.</p>
<p class="bas indent2"><span class="nm">2.</span><span class="cl">Support (Rava):</span> It says, he is <i>the</i> Seris.</p>
<p class="bas indent1"><span class="nm">(f)</span><span class="cl">Question:</span> If he lacks signs of a Seris (and does not bring hairs), when is he (an adult and) a Seris?</p>
<p class="bas indent1"><span class="nm">(g)</span><span class="cl">Answer (R. Chiya):</span> It is after most (35) of one's expected lifetime (70 years).</p>
<p class="bas indent1"><span class="nm">(h)</span>When a man would come to R. Chiya (without hairs at an advanced age), if he was thin, he would tell him to fatten up. If he was fat, he would tell him to become thinner;</p>
<p class="bas indent2"><span class="nm">1.</span><span class="cl">Version #1 (our text, Tosfos):</span> Sometimes thinness causes hairs to come. Sometimes fatness causes them to come.</p>
<p class="bas indent2"><span class="nm">2.</span><span class="cl">Version #2 (Rashbam):</span> Sometimes fatness causes hairs to come. Sometimes it makes them fall out.</p>
<p class="bas indent1"><span class="nm">(i)</span><span class="cl">Question:</span> If a man without hairs sold <i>during</i> the year (at the end of which he may sell his father's property, i.e. 18 or 20 according to Rava or Rav Huna bar Chinena), what is the law?</p>
<p class="bas indent1"><span class="nm">(j)</span><span class="cl">Answer #1 (Rava citing Rav Nachman):</span> His sale is invalid.</p>
<p class="bas indent1"><span class="nm">(k)</span><span class="cl">Answer #2 (Rava bar Rav Shila citing Rav Nachman):</span> His sale is valid.</p>
<p class="bas indent1"><span class="nm">(l)</span>Rava did not say so explicitly. Rather, it was inferred from the following episode.</p>
<p class="bas indent2"><span class="nm">1.</span>Levi sold his father's property during the year. Rava nullified the sale.</p>
<p class="bas indent2"><span class="nm">2.</span>The one who saw this assumed that this was because a sale during the year is invalid.</p>
<p class="bas indent1"><span class="nm">(m)</span><span class="cl">Rejection:</span> We cannot learn from this. Rava saw that Levi was acting excessively foolishly; he freed his slaves.</p>
<p class="bas indent1"><span class="nm">(n)</span><span class="cl">Question (Gidal bar Menasiya):</span> If a 14-year old girl understands business well, may she sell her father's property?</p>
<p class="bas indent1"><span class="nm">(o)</span><span class="cl">Answer (Rava):</span> If she understands business well, her purchases and sales are valid.</p>
<p class="bas indent2"><span class="nm">1.</span><span class="cl">Question:</span> Why didn't Gidal ask about a boy?</p>
<p class="bas indent2"><span class="nm">2.</span><span class="cl">Answer:</span> He asked about a case that occurred with a girl.</p>
<p class="bas indent2"><span class="nm">3.</span><span class="cl">Question:</span> Why didn't he ask about a 12-year old?</p>
<p class="bas indent2"><span class="nm">4.</span><span class="cl">Answer:</span> The case was, she was 14.</p>
<p class="bas indent1"><span class="nm">(p)</span>Reuven was less than 20. He sold his father's property. Before he came in front of Rava, his relatives told him to eat dates and throw the pits in front of Rava (to appear foolish). Rava nullified the sale. When they were writing the ruling, the buyers told Reuven to tell Rava 'one can buy an entire Megilas Esther for one Zuz. Must one pay a Zuz just to write your ruling?!'</p>
<p class="bas indent2"><span class="nm">1.</span>Rava retracted (because he saw that the boy was sharp) and said that the sale stands. The relatives protested that the buyers taught him to say that.</p>
<p class="bas indent2"><span class="nm">2.</span><span class="cl">Rava:</span> Even though he did not think of it himself, since he understands something clever when he hears it, his sale stands. Throwing the pits was due to excessive impudence, and not to immaturity.</p>
<p class="bas subject"><span class="nm">3)</span>TESTIMONY OF ADOLESCENTS</p>
<p class="bas indent1"><span class="nm">(a)</span><span class="cl">(Rav Huna brei d'Rav Yehoshua):</span> An adult less than 18 (or 20) can testify.</p>
<p class="bas indent1"><span class="nm">(b)</span><span class="cl">(Mar Zutra):</span> He can testify only about Metaltelim, but not about land.</p>
<p class="bas indent1"><span class="nm">(c)</span><span class="cl">Question (Rav Ashi):</span> Presumably, you say that he can testify only about Metaltelim, because he can sell them;</p>
<p class="bas indent2"><span class="nm">1.</span>If so, even a minor should be able to testify about Metaltelim!</p>
<p class="bas indent2"><span class="nm">2.</span><span class="cl">(Mishnah):</span> Pa'utos (children who reached a certain level of maturity. Some reach this at six years, and others, not until 10) can buy or sell Metaltelim.</p>
<p class="bas indent1"><span class="nm">(d)</span><span class="cl">Answer (Mar Zutra):</span> It says (about witnesses) "v'Omdu Shnei <i>ha'Anashim.</i>" Minors are not men.</p>
