<p class="bas subject"><span class="nm">1)</span>FORBIDDING SOMETHING NOT YET IN THE WORLD</p>
<p class="bas indent1"><span class="nm">(a)</span><span class="cl">Answer #1 (R. Ilai):</span> We find this regarding one who says 'this field that I sell to you should be Hekdesh when I buy it back!'</p>
<p class="bas indent1"><span class="nm">(b)</span><span class="cl">Objection (R. Yirmiyah):</span> The comparison is faulty! There, he can be Makdish it now (before selling it). A woman cannot divorce herself!</p>
<p class="bas indent2"><span class="nm">1.</span>Our case resembles one who says 'this field that I sold to you should be Hekdesh when I buy it back.' It does not become Hekdesh!</p>
<p class="bas indent1"><span class="nm">(c)</span><span class="cl">Objection (Rav Papa):</span> The comparison is faulty! There, the buyer owns the field itself and its produce. Here, the wife owns her hands!</p>
<p class="bas indent1"><span class="nm">(d)</span><span class="cl">Answer #2 (Rav Papa):</span> We find Hekdesh that cannot take effect now, but takes effect later regarding one who says 'this field that I mortgaged to you (gave for collateral for a loan, to eat its fruit until the loan is repaid) should be Hekdesh when I redeem it.' The field becomes Hekdesh!</p>
<p class="bas indent1"><span class="nm">(e)</span><span class="cl">Objection (Rav Shisha brei d'Rav Idi):</span> The comparison is faulty!</p>
<p class="bas indent2"><span class="nm">1.</span>There, he can redeem the field. A woman cannot divorce herself!</p>
<p class="bas indent1"><span class="nm">(f)</span><span class="cl">Answer #3 (Rav Shisha brei d'Rav Idi):</span> We find this when one says 'this field that I mortgaged to you for 10 years should be Hekdesh when I redeem it.' The field becomes Hekdesh!</p>
<p class="bas indent1"><span class="nm">(g)</span><span class="cl">Objection (Rav Ashi):</span> The comparison is faulty! There, he can redeem the field after 10 years. A wife can never divorce herself!</p>

<p class="bas indent1"><span class="nm">(h)</span><span class="cl">Answer #2 (to Question 2:i, 85b - Rav Ashi):</span> One cannot ask a question from Konamos. They are different. They are like Kedushas ha'Guf (something used for Avodas ha'Mikdash), like Rava taught:</p>
<p class="bas indent2"><span class="nm">1.</span><span class="cl">(Rava):</span> Hekdesh (ha'Guf), the Isur of Chametz, and freeing a slave uproot liens.</p>
<p class="bas indent1"><span class="nm">(i)</span><span class="cl">Question:</span> If so, her earnings should become forbidden immediately. Why does the Mishnah say that the concern is lest he divorce her?</p>
<p class="bas indent1"><span class="nm">(j)</span><span class="cl">Answer:</span> Really, her earnings are forbidden immediately. The Mishnah says 'lest he divorce her' to teach that even if it does not become Hekdesh now (because Chachamim strengthened the lien of a husband), still, he should annul the vow.</p>
<p class="bas subject"><span class="nm">2)</span>MISTAKEN ANNULMENT</p>
<p class="bas indent1"><span class="nm">(a)</span><span class="cl">(Mishnah):</span> In the following cases, a man can go back and annul a vow after he learns of his mistake. (If he already affirmed or annulled it, this was invalid):</p>
<p class="bas indent2"><span class="nm">1.</span>His wife vowed, and he thought that his daughter vowed, or vice-versa;</p>
<p class="bas indent2"><span class="nm">2.</span>She vowed to bring a Korban, and he thought that she vowed to be a Nezirah, or vice-versa;</p>
<p class="bas indent2"><span class="nm">3.</span>She vowed from figs, and he thought that she vowed from grapes, or vice-versa.</p>
<p class="bas indent1"><span class="nm">(b)</span><span class="cl">(Gemara) Inference:</span> "He will annul her" teaches that he must know whose vow he annuls!</p>
