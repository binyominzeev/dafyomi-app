<p class="bas subject"><span class="nm">1)</span>THE LINEAGES THAT CAME TO ERETZ YISRAEL</p>
<p class="bas indent1"><span class="nm">(a)</span><span class="cl">(Mishnah):</span> Converts and freed slaves.</p>
<p class="bas indent1"><span class="nm">(b)</span><span class="cl">Question:</span> What is the source that they came?</p>
<p class="bas indent1"><span class="nm">(c)</span><span class="cl">Answer (Rav Chisda):</span> "And everyone who separated from the impurity of the nations (i.e. converted. All or nations (plural) alludes to another separation, i.e. freedom - Tosfos ha'Rosh)"</p>
<p class="bas indent1"><span class="nm">(d)</span><span class="cl">(Mishnah):</span> Mamzerim.</p>
<p class="bas indent1"><span class="nm">(e)</span><span class="cl">Question:</span> What is the source that Mamzerim came?</p>
<p class="bas indent1"><span class="nm">(f)</span><span class="cl">Answer #1:</span> "Tuvya the slave... was the son-in-law of Shechanyah ben Arach, and his (Tuvya's) son Yehochanan married Meshulach's daughter";</p>
<p class="bas indent2"><span class="nm">1.</span>The Tana holds that the children of a Bas Yisrael from a Nochri or slave are Mamzerim.</p>
<p class="bas indent1"><span class="nm">(g)</span><span class="cl">Question #1:</span> How can we answer for the opinion that children of a Bas Yisrael from a Nochri or slave are Kesheirim?</p>
<p class="bas indent1"><span class="nm">(h)</span><span class="cl">Question #2:</span> Perhaps Tuvya and his son married Benos Yisrael, but had no children!</p>
<p class="bas indent1"><span class="nm">(i)</span><span class="cl">Question #3:</span> What is the source that the children were born in Bavel and came with Ezra? Perhaps they were born in Eretz Yisrael!</p>
<p class="bas indent1"><span class="nm">(j)</span><span class="cl">Answer #2:</span> "Those who came up from Tel Melach, Tel Charsha, Keruv, Adon and Imar could not tell their lineage, if it was from Yisrael."</p>
<p class="bas indent2"><span class="nm">1.</span>"Tel Melach" alludes to people (adulterers,) like those of Sodom (which was transformed to a mound of salt);</p>
<p class="bas indent2"><span class="nm">2.</span>"Tel Charsha (silence)" alludes to one (a Shetuki) whose mother silences him when he calls someone 'father'.</p>
<p class="bas indent2"><span class="nm">3.</span>"They could not tell their lineage, if it was from Yisrael" are Asufim.</p>
<p class="bas subject"><span class="nm">2)</span>PEOPLE WHO DO NOT KEEP A PURE LINEAGE</p>
<p class="bas indent1"><span class="nm">(a)</span><span class="cl">Version #1 (R. Avahu):</span> "Keruv, Adon and Imar" - the Adon (Hash-m) said 'I said that Yisrael should be as sanctified like the Keruvim (the figures on top of the Aron in the Mishkan), but they made themselves like a Nemer (leopard, which is not concerned for marital fidelity).</p>
<p class="bas indent1"><span class="nm">(b)</span><span class="cl">Version #2 (R. Avahu):</span> "Keruv, Adon and Imar" - the Adon said 'even though Yisrael made themselves like a Nemer, they are important to Me like the Keruvim.'</p>
<p class="bas indent1"><span class="nm">(c)</span><span class="cl">(Rabah bar bar Chanah):</span> "Those that came up from Tel Melach, Tel Charsha..." - anyone who marries a woman (whose lineage is) improper for him, it is as if he plowed the world and seeded it with salt.</p>
<p class="bas indent1"><span class="nm">(d)</span><span class="cl">(Rabah bar Rav Ada):</span> If one marries a woman due to money, his children will be improper - "they betrayed Hash-m, for they fathered foreign children".</p>
<p class="bas indent2"><span class="nm">1.</span><span class="cl">Suggestion:</span> Perhaps their money will not be lost.</p>
<p class="bas indent2"><span class="nm">2.</span><span class="cl">Rejection:</span> "Their portions will be consumed in a month."</p>
<p class="bas indent2"><span class="nm">3.</span><span class="cl">Suggestion:</span> Perhaps this only refers to the portion (of her money) for which he is responsible (Tzon Barzel), not the portion for which he has no responsibility (Melug).</p>
<p class="bas indent2"><span class="nm">4.</span><span class="cl">Rejection:</span> It says "their portions".</p>
<p class="bas indent2"><span class="nm">5.</span><span class="cl">Suggestion:</span> Perhaps this will not happen soon.</p>
<p class="bas indent2"><span class="nm">6.</span><span class="cl">Rejection:</span> It will be "in a month."</p>
<p class="bas indent2"><span class="nm">7.</span><span class="cl">(Rav Nachman bar Yitzchak):</span> It is consumed month by month.</p>
<p class="bas indent1"><span class="nm">(e)</span><span class="cl">(Rabah bar Rav Ada):</span> If one marries a woman improper for him, Eliyahu ties him and Hash-m lashes him.</p>
<p class="bas indent1"><span class="nm">(f)</span><span class="cl">(Beraisa):</span> In all such cases, Eliyahu writes and Hash-m signs 'woe to one who disqualifies his seed, blemishes his family, and marries a woman improper for him.'</p>
<p class="bas indent1"><span class="nm">(g)</span>If one constantly degrades people, he himself is Pasul, and never praises others.</p>
<p class="bas indent1"><span class="nm">(h)</span><span class="cl">(Shmuel):</span> He debases other people with his own Psul.</p>
<p class="bas subject"><span class="nm">3)</span>THE MAN WHO DISGRACED RAV YEHUDAH</p>
<p class="bas indent1"><span class="nm">(a)</span>A man of Neharda'a entered a butchery in Pumbedisa. He was told to wait until Rav Yehudah bar Yechezkel's servant received his meat.</p>
<p class="bas indent2"><span class="nm">1.</span><span class="cl">The man:</span> Who is this Yehudah bar Shviskel (glutton), that I should wait for him?!</p>
<p class="bas indent2"><span class="nm">2.</span>When Rav Yehudah heard about this, he excommunicated the man. When he heard that the man always calls people slaves, Rav Yehudah announced that the man is a slave.</p>
<p class="bas indent1"><span class="nm">(b)</span>The man summonsed Rav Yehudah for judgment in front of Rav Nachman. Rav Yehudah received the summons, and was unsure if he should go.</p>
<p class="bas indent2"><span class="nm">1.</span><span class="cl">Rav Huna:</span> Since you are greater than Rav Nachman, you need not go. However, you should go, to honor the Nasi (Rav Nachman married the Reish Galusa's daughter).</p>
<p class="bas indent2"><span class="nm">2.</span>Rav Yehudah wanted to show Rav Nachman that he should not have summonsed him. He saw Rav Nachman building a Ma'akah (railing) around his roof.</p>
<p class="bas indent2"><span class="nm">3.</span><span class="cl">Rav Yehudah:</span> Shmuel taught that a community leader may not work in front of three people!</p>
<p class="bas indent2"><span class="nm">4.</span><span class="cl">Rav Nachman:</span> It is only a small enclosure.</p>
<p class="bas indent2"><span class="nm">5.</span>Rav Yehudah rebuked him repeatedly for using flowery expressions (like the Reish Galusa does), unlike the way Chachamim or common people speak.</p>
<p class="bas indent2"><span class="nm">6.</span><span class="cl">Rav Nachman:</span> Let my daughter serve us drinks.</p>
<p class="bas indent2"><span class="nm">7.</span><span class="cl">Rav Yehudah:</span> Shmuel taught, one may not use a woman among men, even a minor.</p>
<p class="bas indent2"><span class="nm">8.</span><span class="cl">Rav Nachman:</span> Would you like to send regards to my wife?</p>
<p class="bas indent2"><span class="nm">9.</span><span class="cl">Rav Yehudah:</span> (She will respond, and) one may not hear a woman's voice.</p>
<p class="bas bbbline">70b----------------------------------------70b</p>
<p class="bas indent2"><span class="nm">10.</span><span class="cl">Rav Nachman:</span> You can send regards through me!</p>
<p class="bas indent2"><span class="nm">11.</span><span class="cl">Rav Yehudah:</span> Shmuel said that we do not greet women at all.</p>
<p class="bas indent1"><span class="nm">(c)</span>Rav Nachman asked why Rav Yehudah had come. He could not believe that he had summonsed Rav Yehudah, until he saw the summons. (Perhaps the man merely told Rav Nachman 'a man named Yehudah called me a slave', and Rav Nachman had no idea that he referred to Rav Yehudah - <b>PF</b>.) Rav Nachman suggested hearing the case, lest it appear that Chachamim cover up for each other.</p>
<p class="bas indent2"><span class="nm">1.</span><span class="cl">Rav Nachman:</span> Why did you excommunicate the man?</p>
<p class="bas indent2"><span class="nm">2.</span><span class="cl">Rav Yehudah:</span> He annoyed the messenger of a Chacham. Rav lashes for this; I was even stricter.</p>
<p class="bas indent2"><span class="nm">3.</span><span class="cl">Rav Nachman:</span> Why did you announce that he is a slave?</p>
<p class="bas indent2"><span class="nm">4.</span><span class="cl">Rav Yehudah:</span> He constantly says that other people are slaves.</p>
<p class="bas indent3"><span class="nm">i.</span><span class="cl">(Beraisa):</span> If one constantly degrades people, he himself is Pasul;</p>
<p class="bas indent3"><span class="nm">ii.</span><span class="cl">(Shmuel):</span> He debases other people with his own Psul.</p>
<p class="bas indent2"><span class="nm">5.</span><span class="cl">Rav Nachman:</span> Granted, Shmuel said we should suspect lest he has that disqualification. He did not say that we announce it!</p>
<p class="bas indent2"><span class="nm">6.</span><span class="cl">The man:</span> Do you call me a slave? I come from the royal family of Chashmonai!</p>
<p class="bas indent2"><span class="nm">7.</span><span class="cl">Rav Yehudah:</span> Shmuel taught that if one claims to be from the Chashmonayim, he is a slave.</p>
<p class="bas indent2"><span class="nm">8.</span><span class="cl">Rav Nachman:</span> R. Aba taught that a Chacham is not believed to recite a new teaching relevant to a case that already arose!</p>
<p class="bas indent2"><span class="nm">9.</span><span class="cl">Rav Yehudah:</span> Rav Masnah also heard this from Shmuel.</p>
<p class="bas indent3"><span class="nm">i.</span>Rav Masnah had not been in Neharda'a for 13 years. That day, he came.</p>
<p class="bas indent2"><span class="nm">10.</span><span class="cl">(Rav Masnah citing Shmuel):</span> Anyone who claims to be from the Chashmonayim, he is a slave. We learn this from the testimony of a girl, the last (true) remnant of the Chashmonayim, just before she killed herself.</p>
<p class="bas indent2"><span class="nm">11.</span>Rav Nachman announced that the man is a slave. That day, the 'Chashmonai' women tore their Kesuvos. (A slave has no Kidushin or Kesuvah. We must say that the 'Chashmonayim' married exclusively among themselves. If a slave marries a Bas Yisrael, the children are Yisre'elim.)</p>
<p class="bas indent1"><span class="nm">(d)</span>When Rav Yehudah was leaving, people wanted to stone him (for revealing lineage problems).</p>
<p class="bas indent2"><span class="nm">1.</span><span class="cl">Rav Yehudah:</span> If you cause problems, I will reveal what Shmuel said about the lineage of two families of Neharda'a.</p>
<p class="bas indent3"><span class="nm">i.</span>One was assumed to be Kosher, and the other Pasul. Both of these were wrong.</p>
<p class="bas indent2"><span class="nm">2.</span>The people dropped their rocks.</p>
<p class="bas indent1"><span class="nm">(e)</span>Rav Yehudah, Rava, Rav Yosef and Abaye all announced about people of improper lineage.</p>
<p class="bas indent1"><span class="nm">(f)</span><span class="cl">(Rav Yehudah):</span> Four hundred (some say, 4,000) slaves intermarried with Kohanim (in the days of Yirmiyahu). Any brazen Kohen is from them.</p>
<p class="bas indent2"><span class="nm">1.</span><span class="cl">(Abaye):</span> They are all in Neharda'a.</p>
<p class="bas indent1"><span class="nm">(g)</span><span class="cl">(R. Elazar):</span> Brazenness is normal among (even proper) Kohanim - "like quarreling Kohanim."</p>
<p class="bas subject"><span class="nm">4)</span>ON WHOM WILL THE DIVINE PRESENCE REST?</p>
<p class="bas indent1"><span class="nm">(a)</span><span class="cl">(Ravin bar Rav Ada):</span> When Hash-m restores His Presence to us, He will testify about all the tribes (that they are His), but not about one who marries a forbidden woman.</p>
<p class="bas indent2"><span class="nm">1.</span>"The tribes of Hash-m, testimony to Yisrael" - the testimony is only when they are tribes of Hash-m.</p>
<p class="bas indent1"><span class="nm">(b)</span><span class="cl">(R. Chama b'Ribi Chanina):</span> Hash-m will rest His Presence only on families of proper lineage - "I will be Elokim to all families of Yisrael, and they will be to Me a nation."</p>
<p class="bas indent1"><span class="nm">(c)</span><span class="cl">(Rabah bar Rav Huna):</span> For Yisrael, (even if initially they are not worthy,) "I will be Elokim to (them), and (due to this) they will be to Me a nation";</p>
<p class="bas indent2"><span class="nm">1.</span>For converts, only after "his heart moved him to come close to Me. You will be to Me a nation, and I will be Elokim to you."</p>
<p class="bas indent1"><span class="nm">(d)</span><span class="cl">(R. Chelbo):</span> Converts are as problematic for Yisrael as Tzara'as - "the converts will be Nispechu (added) to Yisrael";</p>
<p class="bas indent2"><span class="nm">1.</span>This word is related to Sapachas (a kind of Tzara'as).</p>
