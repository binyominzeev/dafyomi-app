<p class="bas subject"><span class="nm">1)</span>AN INVALID GIFT</p>
<p class="bas indent1"><span class="nm">(a)</span><span class="cl">Question:</span> What did Shamai originally think?</p>
<p class="bas indent1"><span class="nm">(b)</span><span class="cl">Answer:</span> He thought that this is like the gift of Beis Choron.</p>
<p class="bas indent2"><span class="nm">1.</span><span class="cl">(Mishnah):</span> A case occurred in Beis Choron in which a vow forbade Shimon to benefit from his son Levi. Levi was marrying off his son. He told his friend Yehudah 'I give to you the courtyard and the banquet (that I prepared), just so my father can come and eat (and he will benefit from you, and not from me).'</p>
<p class="bas indent2"><span class="nm">2.</span><span class="cl">Yehudah:</span> If they are mine, I hereby make them Hekdesh!</p>
<p class="bas indent2"><span class="nm">3.</span><span class="cl">Levi:</span> I did not give to you in order that you will be Makdish them!</p>
<p class="bas indent2"><span class="nm">4.</span><span class="cl">Yehudah:</span> You gave me so your father can come and eat, and the vow will be transgressed through me (for this is not a real gift)!</p>
<p class="bas indent2"><span class="nm">5.</span><span class="cl">Chachamim:</span> Any gift like this, in which the recipient cannot be Makdish it (Tosfos - because the giver stipulated exactly what must be done with it) is not a gift.</p>
<p class="bas subject"><span class="nm">2)</span>THE TALMIDIM OF HILLEL</p>
<p class="bas indent1"><span class="nm">(a)</span><span class="cl">(Beraisa):</span> Hillel had 80 Talmidim. Thirty were worthy that the Divine Presence rest on them like Moshe (but the generation was not worthy for this), 30 were worthy that the sun should stop for them as it did for Yehoshua, and 20 were intermediate;</p>
<p class="bas indent2"><span class="nm">1.</span>His greatest Talmid was Yonason ben Uzi'el, and his smallest was R. Yochanan Ben Zakai.</p>
<p class="bas indent2"><span class="nm">2.</span>R. Yochanan Ben Zakai learned everything - Torah, Nevi'im, and Kesuvim, Mishnah, Gemara (resolutions of difficulties between Mishnayos), Halachos, Agados, Drashos, Rabbinical enactments, laws learned from Kal va'Chomer and Gezerah Shavah, calculation of the Tekufos (equinoxes and solstices), Gematriyos, parables about launderers and foxes, the speech of Shedim, of date trees and of angels, and big and small matters;</p>
<p class="bas indent3"><span class="nm">i.</span>A big matter is Hash-m's chariot (mentioned in Yechezkeil). A small matter is the questions of Abaye and Rava.</p>
<p class="bas indent3"><span class="nm">ii.</span>He fulfilled "Lehanchil l'Ohavai Yesh v'Otzroseihem Amalei."</p>
<p class="bas indent2"><span class="nm">3.</span>He was the smallest Talmid. All the more so the greatest (knew all this)!</p>
<p class="bas indent2"><span class="nm">4.</span>When Yonason ben Uzi'el engaged in Torah, a bird flying over him would be burned.</p>
<p class="bas subject"><span class="nm">3)</span>WHEN A MAN CAN EXEMPT HIS WIFE FROM YIBUM</p>
<p class="bas indent1"><span class="nm">(a)</span><span class="cl">(Mishnah):</span> If Reuven says 'this is my son', he is believed (this will be explained);</p>
<p class="bas indent1"><span class="nm">(b)</span>If he says 'this (Ploni) is my brother', he is not believed (to make his brothers share their inheritance with Ploni). He divides his share with Ploni;</p>
<p class="bas indent2"><span class="nm">1.</span>When Ploni dies, Reuven gets back what Ploni took from Reuven's share.</p>
<p class="bas indent2"><span class="nm">2.</span>If Ploni had received property from another place, all the brothers share it.</p>
<p class="bas indent1"><span class="nm">(c)</span><span class="cl">(Gemara) Question:</span> When he says 'this (Ploni) is my son', regarding what is he believed?</p>
<p class="bas indent1"><span class="nm">(d)</span><span class="cl">Answer (Rav Yehudah):</span> Ploni inherits Reuven, and exempts Reuven's wife from Yibum.</p>
<p class="bas bbbline">134b----------------------------------------134b</p>
<p class="bas indent1"><span class="nm">(e)</span><span class="cl">Objection:</span> Obviously, Reuven is believed to say that Ploni inherits him. He could give his money to him for a gift if he wants! (This applies to what Reuven owns now. He is not believed regarding property he will receive later.)</p>
<p class="bas indent1"><span class="nm">(f)</span><span class="cl">Answer:</span> The Chidush is that Reuven is believed to exempt his wife from Yibum.</p>
<p class="bas indent1"><span class="nm">(g)</span><span class="cl">Question:</span> We already learn this from a Mishnah!</p>
<p class="bas indent2"><span class="nm">1.</span><span class="cl">(Mishnah):</span> If Reuven said just before he died 'I have sons', he is believed (to exempt his wife from Yibum);</p>
<p class="bas indent2"><span class="nm">2.</span>If he said 'I have brothers', he is not believed (to forbid his wife from remarrying).</p>
<p class="bas indent1"><span class="nm">(h)</span><span class="cl">Answer:</span> There, he is Muchzak not to have brothers (he is believed because even without his words, the Chazakah is that his wife will be permitted when he dies);</p>
<p class="bas indent2"><span class="nm">1.</span>Here, he is believed even if he is Muchzak to have brothers.</p>
<p class="bas indent1"><span class="nm">(i)</span><span class="cl">(Rav Yosef citing Rav Yehudah):</span> He is believed because a husband is believed to say that he divorced his wife.</p>
<p class="bas indent1"><span class="nm">(j)</span><span class="cl">Objection (Rav Yosef):</span> What I said is improper. It attributes the reason for a Mishnah to a law not taught in a Mishnah!</p>
<p class="bas indent1"><span class="nm">(k)</span><span class="cl">Correction (Rav Yosef):</span> Rather, surely Rav Yehudah taught that he is believed because he could exempt her from Yibum if he wants by divorcing her.</p>
<p class="bas subject"><span class="nm">4)</span>WHEN A MAN IS BELIEVED TO SAY THAT HE DIVORCED HIS WIFE</p>
<p class="bas indent1"><span class="nm">(a)</span><span class="cl">(Rav Yosef):</span> Since we believe a person based on what he could do, a man is believed to say that he divorced his wife, because he could divorce her.</p>
<p class="bas indent1"><span class="nm">(b)</span><span class="cl">(Rav Yitzchak bar Yosef citing R. Yochanan):</span> A man is not believed to say that he divorced his wife.</p>
<p class="bas indent1"><span class="nm">(c)</span><span class="cl">(Rav Sheshes):</span> This disproves Rav Yosef's reasoning!</p>
<p class="bas indent1"><span class="nm">(d)</span><span class="cl">Question:</span> R. Chiya bar Avin cited R. Yochanan to say that a man is believed to say that he divorced his wife!</p>
<p class="bas indent1"><span class="nm">(e)</span><span class="cl">Answer:</span> Rav Yitzchak taught that he is not believed about the past (e.g. to exempt her if she committed adultery). R. Chiya bar Avin taught that he is believed about the future.</p>
<p class="bas indent1"><span class="nm">(f)</span><span class="cl">Question:</span> If a man said that he divorced his wife at a specific time in the past, (he is not believed about the past, but) is he believed about the future?</p>
<p class="bas indent2"><span class="nm">1.</span>Do we divide his statement (and believe that he divorced her, but not when this was), or not (and since we cannot believe his entire statement, we do not believe him at all)?</p>
<p class="bas indent1"><span class="nm">(g)</span><span class="cl">Answer #1 (Rav Mari or Rav Zvid):</span> We divide his words.</p>
<p class="bas indent1"><span class="nm">(h)</span><span class="cl">Answer #2 (the other of Rav Mari and Rav Zvid):</span> We do not divide his words.</p>
<p class="bas indent1"><span class="nm">(i)</span><span class="cl">Question:</span> Why is this different than Rava's law?</p>
<p class="bas indent2"><span class="nm">1.</span><span class="cl">(Rava):</span> If Reuven says 'Ploni had Bi'ah with my wife', he can join with another witness to kill Ploni, but not to kill his wife. (Even though Reuven is not believed about his own wife, it is as if he said 'Ploni had Bi'ah with a married woman' and 'a man had Bi'ah with my wife'. He is believed about the former.)</p>
<p class="bas indent1"><span class="nm">(j)</span><span class="cl">Answer:</span> When he discusses two people we divide his words, but not when he discusses one.</p>
