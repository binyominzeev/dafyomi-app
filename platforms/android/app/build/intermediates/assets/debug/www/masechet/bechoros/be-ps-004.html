<p class="bas subject"><span class="nm">1)</span>KEDUSHAS BECHOR DOES NOT APPLY TO KOHANIM AND LEVIYIM</p>
<p class="bas indent1"><span class="nm">(a)</span>(After Chet ha'Egel, the Bechoros were disqualified from Avodas ha'Mishkan. The Leviyim (including Kohanim) were taken in place of 22,000 of them. There were 273 surplus Bechoros. Each had to redeem himself for five Shekalim. The animals of the Leviyim were in place of those of the Bechoros. This was in the second year in the Midbar. We call this "at that time.")</p>
<p class="bas indent1"><span class="nm">(b)</span><span class="cl">(Mishnah):</span> A Kal va'Chomer exempts (Pitrei Chamorim of) Kohanim and Leviyim (from Kedushas Bechor). If Kohanim and Leviyim exempted Yisraelim in the Midbar, all the more so they (their animals) are exempt!</p>
<p class="bas indent1"><span class="nm">(c)</span><span class="cl">(Gemara) Question:</span> People (Kohanim and Leviyim) exempted people (Yisraelim), and (their) animals exempted animals (of Yisraelim) - "Kach Es ha'Leviyim Tachas Kol Bechor bi'Vnei Yisrael v'Es Behemas ha'Leviyim Tachas Behemtam." (However, what is the source that people (Leviyim) exempt (their own) animals?)</p>
<p class="bas indent1"><span class="nm">(d)</span><span class="cl">Answer #1 (Abaye):</span> The Mishnah means, since the Seiyin (this is the plural of 'Seh') of Kohanim and Leviyim exempted Pitrei Chamorim of Yisraelim in the Midbar, all the more so they themselves are exempt!</p>
<p class="bas indent1"><span class="nm">(e)</span><span class="cl">Objection #1 (Rava):</span> The Mishnah says that Kohanim and Leviyim (themselves) exempted (Yisraelim)!</p>
<p class="bas indent1"><span class="nm">(f)</span><span class="cl">Objection #2 (Rava):</span> If so, even Tahor Behemos of Kohanim and Leviyim should be exempt!</p>
<p class="bas indent2"><span class="nm">1.</span><span class="cl">(Mishnah):</span> Kohanim and Leviyim are exempt only from Kedushas Bechor of Peter Chamor and people (but not from Bechor Behemah Tehorah).</p>
<p class="bas indent1"><span class="nm">(g)</span><span class="cl">Answer #2 (Rava):</span> The Mishnah means that since Kohanim and Leviyim exempted (people, i.e.) Yisraelim in the Midbar, all the more so they themselves are exempt.</p>
<p class="bas indent1"><span class="nm">(h)</span><span class="cl">Question:</span> What is the source that their animals exempt those of Yisrael?</p>
<p class="bas indent1"><span class="nm">(i)</span><span class="cl">Answer:</span> "Ach Pado Sifdeh Es Bechor ha'Adam v'Es Bechor ha'Behemah ha'Teme'ah Tifdeh" teaches that Kedushas Bechor of Behemah Teme'ah (i.e. donkeys) applies only to animals of people obligated to redeem themselves (i.e. Yisraelim).</p>
<p class="bas indent1"><span class="nm">(j)</span><span class="cl">Question #1 (against Abaye - Rav Safra):</span> You say that the Kal va'Chomer applies also to animals. It is valid only for a Levi (in the Midbar) who had a Seh (at that time, to redeem Behemos Yisrael), but (Shitah - descendants of) a Levi in the Midbar who did not have a Seh should have (Rashi - had) to redeem his own Pitrei Chamorim! (Questions 2, 3 and 4 are against Abaye and Rava.)</p>
<p class="bas indent1"><span class="nm">(k)</span><span class="cl">Question #2 (Rav Safra):</span> Only Leviyim at least one month old (at that time) exempted Yisraelim. We should say that a Levi less than one month did not exempt himself! (We do not find that such Leviyim needed to be redeemed.)</p>
<p class="bas indent1"><span class="nm">(l)</span><span class="cl">Question #3 (Rav Safra):</span> Only male Leviyim exempted Yisraelim. Children of a Bas Levi should not be exempt!</p>
<p class="bas indent2"><span class="nm">1.</span><span class="cl">(Rav Ada bar Ahavah):</span> The Bechor of a Bas Levi need not be redeemed.</p>
<p class="bas indent1"><span class="nm">(m)</span><span class="cl">Answer (Mar brei d'Rav Yosef):</span> Kedushas Bechor depends on "Peter Rechem," therefore a Bas Levi exempts her son just like a Levi does. (Rashi - this answer depends on finding an answer to Question #2, that exemption is not limited to Leviyim who actually exempted Yisraelim; Tosfos - this answer stands by itself.)</p>
<p class="bas indent1"><span class="nm">(n)</span><span class="cl">Question #4:</span> Aharon was not counted (he did not exempt a Yisrael). His Pitrei Chamorim should not have been exempt!</p>
<p class="bas indent2"><span class="nm">1.</span><span class="cl">(Beraisa):</span> There are are dots over Aharon's name (in the Parshah of counting the Leviyim) to show that he was not counted.</p>
<p class="bas indent1"><span class="nm">(o)</span><span class="cl">Answer (to Questions 1, 2 and 4):</span> "Ha'Leviyim" equates all the Leviyim to each other. (All of their Pitrei Chamorim are exempt).</p>
<p class="bas indent1"><span class="nm">(p)</span><span class="cl">Question:</span> What is the source that also (Aharon and other) Kohanim are equated?</p>
<p class="bas indent1"><span class="nm">(q)</span><span class="cl">Answer:</span> We learn from R. Yehoshua ben Levi.</p>
<p class="bas indent2"><span class="nm">1.</span><span class="cl">(R. Yehoshua ben Levi):</span> In 24 verses, Kohanim are called Leviyim, e.g. "veha'Kohanim ha'Leviyim Bnei Tzadok."</p>

<p class="bas indent1"><span class="nm">(r)</span><span class="cl">Question:</span> What is the source that they are exempt for all generations?</p>
<p class="bas indent1"><span class="nm">(s)</span><span class="cl">Answer:</span> "<i>V'Hayu</i> Li ha'Leviyim" teaches that their law will not change.</p>
<p class="bas subject"><span class="nm">2)</span>A SEH REDEEMED PITREI CHAMORIM IN THE MIDBAR</p>
<p class="bas indent1"><span class="nm">(a)</span><span class="cl">Question:</span> What is the source that a Yisrael's Peter Chamor was exempted by a Levi's <i>Seh</i> (at that time in the Midbar)?</p>
<p class="bas indent1"><span class="nm">(b)</span><span class="cl">Answer #1 (Rav Chisda):</span> For all generations, the Torah discusses redeeming (people) with money and (Pitrei Chamorim) with a Seh;</p>
<p class="bas indent2"><span class="nm">1.</span>Just like money was also used to redeem at that time, also a Seh.</p>
<p class="bas indent1"><span class="nm">(c)</span><span class="cl">Objection:</span> We cannot learn from money. It has more ability to redeem. It can redeem Hekdesh and Ma'aser Sheni!</p>
<p class="bas indent1"><span class="nm">(d)</span><span class="cl">Answer #2:</span> It says "Ach Pado Sifdeh Es Bechor ha'Adam v'Es Bechor ha'Behemah ha'Teme'ah Tifdeh";</p>
<p class="bas indent2"><span class="nm">1.</span>Just like the same thing (i.e. money) used to redeem firstborn sons for all generations was used at that time, the same thing (a Seh) used to redeem a Peter Chamor for all generations was used at that time.</p>
<p class="bas indent1"><span class="nm">(e)</span><span class="cl">(R. Chanina):</span> One Seh of a Levi redeemed (at that time) many Pitrei Chamorim of Yisraelim.</p>
<p class="bas indent1"><span class="nm">(f)</span><span class="cl">Support #1 (Abaye):</span> This is surely true, for the Torah counts how many more Bechoros there were than Leviyim, but not how many Pitrei Chamorei Yisrael there were in excess of Seiyin of Leviyim.</p>
<p class="bas indent1"><span class="nm">(g)</span><span class="cl">Objection:</span> Perhaps it does not count animals because there was no excess. The Leviyim had more!</p>
<p class="bas indent1"><span class="nm">(h)</span><span class="cl">Answer:</span> "U'Mikneh Rav Haysah li'Vnei Reuven uli'Vnei Gad." ("Mikneh" includes donkeys).</p>
<p class="bas indent1"><span class="nm">(i)</span><span class="cl">Rejection:</span> Still, perhaps the Seiyin (that were not Bechoros) of the Leviyim exceeded the number of Pitrei Chamorim of Yisrael!</p>
<p class="bas indent1"><span class="nm">(j)</span><span class="cl">Support #2:</span> "V'Es <i>Behemas</i> ha'Leviyim Tachas <i>Behemtam</i>" - one Behemah of a Levi exempted many Behemos of Yisrael.</p>
<p class="bas indent1"><span class="nm">(k)</span><span class="cl">Question:</span> "Behemah" can refer to many animals - "Behemah Rabah"!</p>
<p class="bas indent1"><span class="nm">(l)</span><span class="cl">Answer:</span> If each Levite Seh exempted only one animal, it should have said "Behemah Tachas Behemah," or "Behemtam Tachas Behemtam";</p>
<p class="bas indent2"><span class="nm">1.</span>Rather, it uses the singular for the Leviyim and the plural for Yisrael, to teach like R. Chanina.</p>
<p class="bas indent1"><span class="nm">(m)</span><span class="cl">Support #3 (Rava - Mishnah):</span> The same Seh can redeem many times. (Rashi - after buying it back from the Kohen, the Yisrael can redeem another Peter Chamor with it. R. Tam - a Yisrael can redeem many Safek Pitrei Chamorim with one Seh. He need not give it to a Kohen);</p>
<p class="bas indent1"><span class="nm">(n)</span>R. Chanina explains that the same Seh can redeem many times, because one Seh of a Levi in the Midbar redeemed many Pitrei Chamorim of Yisraelim.</p>

<p class="bas indent1"><span class="nm">(a)</span><span class="cl">Version #1 (R. Yochanan):</span> Bechoros born in the Midbar became Kodesh.</p>

<p class="bas indent1"><span class="nm">(d)</span><span class="cl">Answer (Reish Lakish):</span> The Bechoros who left Mitzrayim did the Avodah.</p>
<p class="bas indent1"><span class="nm">(e)</span><span class="cl">Support:</span> Bechoros born in the Midbar were too young to do Avodah (when the Mishkan was erected). The Mishkan was set up less than a year after leaving Miztrayim!</p>

<p class="bas indent2"><span class="nm">2.</span><span class="cl">Answer:</span> He holds that the Kedushah of Bechoros that were already Kadosh would have lapsed in the Midbar if newly born Bechoros were not becoming Kadosh.</p>
<p class="bas indent2"><span class="nm">3.</span>Reish Lakish holds that previous Bechoros retained their Kedushah, but new Bechoros did not become Kadosh.</p>
