<p class="dedicationbox"><br>12th CYCLE DEDICATION<br>KESUVOS 87 (17 Kislev) - Today's learning is dedicated in loving memory of Professor Dr. Eugene (Mordechai ben Aharon) Heimler, on his 17th yahrzeit, by his beloved wife, Miriam Bracha. May the Zechus of the Torah being learned around the world be an Iluy for his Neshamah. </p>

<p class="bas subject"><span class="nm">1)</span>FROM WHICH OATH DID HE EXEMPT HER?</p>
<p class="bas indent1"><span class="nm">(a)</span><span class="cl">(Gemara):</span> Which oath is this (from which he exempts her)?</p>
<p class="bas indent1"><span class="nm">(b)</span><span class="cl">Answer #1 (Rav Yehudah):</span> It is the oath about when she was an overseer in the life of her husband.</p>
<p class="bas indent1"><span class="nm">(c)</span><span class="cl">Answer #2 (Rav Nachman):</span> It is even the oath that Chachamim imposed on one who received part of her Kesuvah and requests the rest.</p>
<p class="bas indent1"><span class="nm">(d)</span><span class="cl">Question (Rav Mordechai):</span> Granted, according to Rav Nachman a woman anticipates that she may need to be paid part of the Kesuvah in advance, and she would ask her husband to exempt her from swearing on the rest;</p>
<p class="bas indent2"><span class="nm">1.</span>But according to Rav Yehudah, did she expect to be an overseer and ask to be exempted from that oath?!</p>
<p class="bas indent1"><span class="nm">(e)</span><span class="cl">Answer (Rav Ashi):</span> You learn that Rav Yehudah explained the Reisha (therefore you have a difficulty). We learn that he discussed the Seifa (and Rav Nachman explains the Reisha);</p>
<p class="bas indent2"><span class="nm">1.</span><span class="cl">(Seifa):</span> If she went from burying her husband to her father's house, or returned to her father-in-law's house, and did not become an overseer, the heirs cannot make her swear. If she became an overseer, the heirs can make her swear about the future, but not about the past.</p>
<p class="bas indent2"><span class="nm">2.</span><span class="cl">Question:</span> What is an oath about the past (from which she is exempt)?</p>
<p class="bas indent2"><span class="nm">3.</span><span class="cl">Answer #1 (Rav Yehudah):</span> It is the oath about when she was an overseer in his lifetime. His heirs can make her swear about from his death until the burial. (The property fell to them, so his stipulation does not exempt her.)</p>
<p class="bas indent2"><span class="nm">4.</span><span class="cl">Answer #2 (Rav Masnah):</span> They cannot make her swear even about the period from his death until the burial.</p>
<p class="bas indent3"><span class="nm">i.</span><span class="cl">(Chachamim of Nehardai):</span> To pay for head-tax, burial or food, we sell property of orphans without waiting the usual 30 days of auctioning (because there is no time. Likewise, she does not have time before burial to sell for the proper price, so we exempt her from swearing.)</p>
<p class="bas subject"><span class="nm">2)</span>WHICH EXPRESSIONS EXEMPT FROM AN OATH TO THE HEIRS?</p>
<p class="bas indent1"><span class="nm">(a)</span><span class="cl">(Rabah citing R. Chiya):</span> If a man wrote '(I have against you) no vow and no oath', he cannot make her swear, but his heirs can;</p>
<p class="bas indent2"><span class="nm">1.</span>If he wrote 'clean vow, clean oath (you are exempt from a vow or oath)', neither he nor his heirs can make her swear.</p>
<p class="bas indent3"><span class="nm">i.</span>He meant that she is totally clean from the need to swear.</p>
<p class="bas indent1"><span class="nm">(b)</span><span class="cl">(Rav Yosef citing R. Chiya):</span> If he wrote 'no vow and no oath', he cannot make her swear, but his heirs can;</p>
<p class="bas indent2"><span class="nm">1.</span>If he wrote 'clean vow, clean oath', both he and his heirs can make her swear.</p>
<p class="bas indent3"><span class="nm">i.</span>He meant that if she is suspected she will clear herself by swearing.</p>
<p class="bas indent1"><span class="nm">(c)</span><span class="cl">(R. Zakai):</span> Whether he wrote 'no oath', 'clean oath', 'no vow', or 'clean vow', if he said 'in (Bach - from) <i>my</i> property', he cannot make her swear, but his heirs can;</p>
<p class="bas indent2"><span class="nm">1.</span>If he wrote 'from <i>these</i> properties', neither he nor his heirs can make her swear.</p>
<p class="bas indent1"><span class="nm">(d)</span><span class="cl">Version #1 (Rav Nachman, citing Aba Sha'ul ben Eima Miryam):</span> Whether he 'no oath', 'clean oath', 'no vow', or 'clean vow', whether he wrote 'from <i>my</i> property' or 'from <i>these</i> properties', neither he nor his heirs can make her swear;</p>
<p class="bas indent2"><span class="nm">1.</span>But what can I do? We learned that one can collect from orphans' property only if he swears!</p>
<p class="bas indent1"><span class="nm">(e)</span><span class="cl">Version #2 (Beraisa - Aba Sha'ul ben Eima Miryam):</span> Whether he 'no oath', 'clean oath', 'no vow', or 'clean vow', whether he wrote 'from my property' or from these properties', neither he nor his heirs can make her swear;</p>
<p class="bas indent2"><span class="nm">1.</span>But what can I do? We learned that one can collect from orphans' property only if he swears!</p>
<p class="bas indent1"><span class="nm">(f)</span><span class="cl">(Rav Nachman):</span> The Halachah follows Aba Sha'ul.</p>
<p class="bas subject"><span class="nm">3)</span>CASES THAT ALWAYS REQUIRE AN OATH</p>
<p class="bas indent1"><span class="nm">(a)</span><span class="cl">(Mishnah):</span> In all the following cases, a woman must swear to receive her Kesuvah:</p>
<p class="bas indent2"><span class="nm">1.</span>She admits that she already received partial payment.</p>
<p class="bas indent2"><span class="nm">2.</span>One witness says that it was paid.</p>
<p class="bas indent2"><span class="nm">3.</span>She collects from orphans.</p>
<p class="bas indent2"><span class="nm">4.</span>She collects from buyers.</p>
<p class="bas indent2"><span class="nm">5.</span>She collects in her ex-husband's absence.</p>
<p class="bas indent1"><span class="nm">(b)</span>An example of partial payment is when the Kesuvah was 1000 Zuz, he says that she received it all, and she says that she received only 100. She collects only with an oath.</p>
<p class="bas indent1"><span class="nm">(c)</span>A case of one witness is when the Kesuvah was 1000 Zuz; he says that she received it, she denies this, and one witness says that it was paid. She collects only with an oath.</p>
<p class="bas indent1"><span class="nm">(d)</span>The case of collecting from buyers is when her husband sold his property to others, and she collects from them. She collects only with an oath.</p>
<p class="bas indent1"><span class="nm">(e)</span>The case of collecting from orphans is when he died and left his property to orphans, and she collects from them. She collects only with an oath.</p>
<p class="bas indent1"><span class="nm">(f)</span>The case of collecting in her husband's absence is when he went overseas, and she collects in his absence. She collects only with an oath;</p>
<p class="bas bbbline">87b----------------------------------------87b</p>
<p class="bas indent1"><span class="nm">(g)</span>R. Shimon says, whenever she claims her Kesuvah, the heirs can make her swear. If she does not claim her Kesuvah, they cannot make her swear.</p>
<p class="bas indent1"><span class="nm">(h)</span><span class="cl">(Gemara - Rami bar Chama):</span> The oath (in the Reisha) is mid'Oraisa. She claims 200, and he admits to 100. This is Modeh b'Miktzas. In every case of partial admission one must swear!</p>
<p class="bas indent1"><span class="nm">(i)</span><span class="cl">Rejection #1 (Rava):</span> In every mid'Oraisa oath, one swears to avoid paying. Here, she swears to receive!</p>
<p class="bas indent1"><span class="nm">(j)</span><span class="cl">Rejection #2 (Rava):</span> Oaths (mid'Oraisa) do not apply when the contested debt has a lien to be paid from land!</p>
<p class="bas indent1"><span class="nm">(k)</span><span class="cl">(Rava):</span> Rather, the oath is mid'Rabanan.</p>
<p class="bas indent2"><span class="nm">1.</span>One who pays is meticulous, but one who is paid is not so careful. Chachamim imposed an oath on her so that she will be more exact.</p>
<p class="bas indent1"><span class="nm">(l)</span><span class="cl">Question:</span> If witnesses say that she received part of her Kesuvah, must she swear to receive the rest?</p>
<p class="bas indent2"><span class="nm">1.</span>Had he paid the rest at another time, also then he would have paid it in front of witnesses (so she need not swear);</p>
<p class="bas indent2"><span class="nm">2.</span>Or, perhaps there just happened to be witnesses when he paid part (but he is not careful to pay in front of witnesses)!</p>
<p class="bas indent1"><span class="nm">(m)</span><span class="cl">Answer (Mishnah):</span> Every oath mid'Oraisa is to avoid paying. The following swear (mid'Rabanan) to receive:</p>
<p class="bas indent2"><span class="nm">1.</span>A worker;</p>
<p class="bas indent2"><span class="nm">2.</span>One who was robbed;</p>
<p class="bas indent2"><span class="nm">3.</span>One who was wounded;</p>
<p class="bas indent2"><span class="nm">4.</span>One who claims payment from one who (may not swear because he) is suspected to swear falsely;</p>
<p class="bas indent2"><span class="nm">5.</span>If Reuven told Shimon to pay Reuven's workers, and Shimon says that he paid, and the workers deny this, Shimon and the workers swear and receive.</p>
<p class="bas indent2"><span class="nm">6.</span>One who admits that his loan document was partially paid, not in front of witnesses.</p>
<p class="bas indent2"><span class="nm">7.</span><span class="cl">Inference:</span> Had witnesses seen the partial payment, he would not swear!</p>
<p class="bas indent1"><span class="nm">(n)</span><span class="cl">Rejection:</span> No, the Mishnah teaches that even if there are no witnesses, he swears.</p>
<p class="bas indent2"><span class="nm">1.</span>It is not so surprising that when there are witnesses, he swears. When there are no witnesses, one might have thought that admitting to partial payment is like Hashavas Aveidah (returning a lost object), and he receives the rest without swearing. The Mishnah teaches that this is not so.</p>
<p class="bas indent1"><span class="nm">(o)</span><span class="cl">Question:</span> If she admits that her Kesuvah was partially paid, and includes payments of less than a Perutah, must she swear to receive the rest?</p>
<p class="bas indent2"><span class="nm">1.</span>Do we say that since she is so exacting, surely she is telling the truth?</p>
<p class="bas indent2"><span class="nm">2.</span>Or, perhaps this is a scheme (to make us think that she is exact, so we will exempt her from swearing)!</p>
<p class="bas indent1"><span class="nm">(p)</span>This question is unresolved.</p>
<p class="bas indent1"><span class="nm">(q)</span><span class="cl">Question:</span> If she admits that she is not entitled to the amount written in her Kesuvah, must she swear about what she says that she is entitled to in order to receive it?</p>
<p class="bas indent2"><span class="nm">1.</span>Is this like admitting to partial payment? If so, she must swear;</p>
<p class="bas indent2"><span class="nm">2.</span>Or, is it different because she does not admit to any partial payment?</p>
<p class="bas indent1"><span class="nm">(r)</span><span class="cl">Answer (Beraisa):</span> One who admits that she is not entitled to the amount written in her Kesuvah receives the rest without an oath.</p>
<p class="bas indent2"><span class="nm">1.</span>If the Kesuvah says 1000, he says that he paid it, and she denies this but she admits that she accepted that it be only 100, she is paid without swearing.</p>
<p class="bas indent2"><span class="nm">2.</span><span class="cl">Question:</span> Why does she receive (100)? Her Kesuvah is an invalid document!</p>
<p class="bas indent2"><span class="nm">3.</span><span class="cl">Answer (Rava brei d'Rabah):</span> She says that he authorized the witnesses to write a Kesuvah for 1000, just she promised him that she will claim only 100.</p>
<p class="bas subject"><span class="nm">4)</span>SWEARING AGAINST ONE WITNESS</p>
<p class="bas indent1"><span class="nm">(a)</span><span class="cl">(Mishnah):</span> If one witness says that it was paid...</p>
<p class="bas indent1"><span class="nm">(b)</span><span class="cl">(Rami bar Chama):</span> The oath is mid'Oraisa. "One witness will not obligate a person for any sin...", but he can force a person to swear.</p>
<p class="bas indent2"><span class="nm">1.</span>Wherever two witnesses would obligate a person to pay, one witness forces him to swear.</p>
<p class="bas indent1"><span class="nm">(c)</span><span class="cl">Rejection #1 (Rava):</span> In every mid'Oraisa oath, one swears to avoid paying. Here, she swears to receive!</p>
<p class="bas indent1"><span class="nm">(d)</span><span class="cl">Rejection #2 (Rava):</span> Oaths (mid'Oraisa) do not apply when the contested debt has a lien to be paid from land!</p>
<p class="bas indent1"><span class="nm">(e)</span><span class="cl">(Rava):</span> Rather, the oath is mid'Rabanan, to appease the husband.</p>
