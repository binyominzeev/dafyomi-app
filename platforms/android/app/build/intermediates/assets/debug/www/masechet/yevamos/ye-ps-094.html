<p class="dedicationbox">YEVAMOS 94 (15 Teves) - dedicated by Dr. Moshe and Rivka Snow in memory of Rivka's mother, Rebbetzin Leah bas Rav Yosef (Rabinowitz), the Manostrishtcher Rebbetzin, whose Yahrzeit is 15 Teves. </p>

<p class="bas subject"><span class="nm">1)</span>DOES ONE WITNESS PERMIT A <i>YEVAMAH</i>?</p>
<p class="bas indent1"><span class="nm">(a)</span><span class="cl">Answer #1 (Rav Sheshes - Mishnah #1):</span> A woman's husband and son went overseas. They told her that her husband died and then her son died. She remarried. Later, they told her the son died first (so she needed to do Yibum or Chalitzah). She must leave her husband. Children she had from him, both the first and last, are Mamzerim.</p>
<p class="bas indent2"><span class="nm">1.</span><span class="cl">Question:</span> What is the case?</p>
<p class="bas indent2"><span class="nm">2.</span><span class="cl">Answer #1:</span> Two witnesses told her the first time, and two witnesses later contradicted them.</p>
<p class="bas indent2"><span class="nm">3.</span><span class="cl">Objection #1:</span> Why should we believe the second witnesses more than the first?</p>
<p class="bas indent2"><span class="nm">4.</span><span class="cl">Objection #2:</span> The child is only a Safek Mamzer!</p>
<p class="bas indent3"><span class="nm">i.</span><span class="cl">Suggestion:</span> Perhaps the Tana was not so exact.</p>
<p class="bas indent3"><span class="nm">ii.</span><span class="cl">Rejection (Seifa):</span> The first children are Mamzerim, but later children are not.</p>
<p class="bas indent3"><span class="nm">iii.</span>This shows that the Tana was exact!</p>
<p class="bas indent2"><span class="nm">5.</span><span class="cl">Answer #2:</span> Rather, one witness told her the first time, and later two not contradicted him.</p>
<p class="bas indent2"><span class="nm">6.</span><span class="cl">Inference:</span> Had he not been contradicted, he would have been believed!</p>
<p class="bas indent1"><span class="nm">(b)</span><span class="cl">Rejection (and Answer #3 to Question a:1):</span> We can say like Rav Acha bar Minyomi said (elsewhere), it is a case of Edim Zomemim. (Two witnesses testified, and two others said 'You could not have seen this, for you were with us elsewhere at that time.' We believe the latter witnesses.)</p>
<p class="bas indent1"><span class="nm">(c)</span><span class="cl">Answer #2 (Rav Mordechai - Mishnah #2):</span> A woman is not believed to say 'My Yavam died' to marry a stranger, nor to say 'My sister died' to marry her sister's husband.</p>
<p class="bas indent2"><span class="nm">1.</span><span class="cl">Inference:</span> She is not believed, but one witness would be believed!</p>
<p class="bas indent1"><span class="nm">(d)</span><span class="cl">Rejection (Rav Ashi - Seifa):</span> A man is not believed to say 'My brother died' so he will do Yibum, nor to say 'My wife died' to marry her sister.</p>
<p class="bas indent2"><span class="nm">1.</span>If you make the above inference, you should also infer here that he is not believed, but one witness is!</p>
<p class="bas indent2"><span class="nm">2.</span><span class="cl">Objection:</span> Granted, Chachamim were lenient to believe one witness to permit a woman lest she be an Agunah (unable to remarry). This does not apply to marrying one's wife's sister!</p>
<p class="bas indent2"><span class="nm">3.</span><span class="cl">Answer:</span> Rather, Mishnah #2 is like R. Akiva. Since he holds that a child of Chayavei Lavin is a Mamzer, we would have thought that a Yevamah is concerned for her children and will check well before marrying, so she should be believed;</p>
<p class="bas indent3"><span class="nm">i.</span>The Mishnah teaches that this is not so. She is concerned only for her own ruin, but not for that of her children. (Rashi rejects this text, for according to R. Akiva, also a Yevamah who married a stranger is ruined. Tosfos 92b DH Aval - Mishnah #2 is no Chidush according to Chachamim. Our Sugya permits a Yevamah to do Yibum even after she was Mezanah or married l'Shuk. Since she will not be fined, obviously she is not believed!)</p>
<p class="bas indent1"><span class="nm">(e)</span><span class="cl">Answer #3 (Rava):</span> A Kal va'Chomer teaches that one witness is believed about a Yevamah:</p>
<p class="bas indent2"><span class="nm">1.</span>One witness permits Chayavei Kerisus (Eshes Ish), all the more so he permits Chayavei Lavin!</p>
<p class="bas indent1"><span class="nm">(f)</span><span class="cl">Objection (a Chacham):</span> A woman's credibility refutes your reasoning!</p>
<p class="bas indent2"><span class="nm">1.</span>She is believed for Chayavei Kerisus (if she says 'my husband died'), but she is not believed for Chayavei Lavin (to say that her Yavam died)!</p>
<p class="bas indent2"><span class="nm">2.</span>This is because sometimes she hates the Yavam, and she will not check well. The same applies when one witness says that the Yavam died!</p>
<p class="bas indent1"><span class="nm">(g)</span><span class="cl">(Mishnah - R. Elazar ben Masya):</span> "And a woman divorced from her husband (is forbidden to a Kohen)", but not a woman divorced from a man who is not her husband.</p>
<p class="bas indent1"><span class="nm">(h)</span><span class="cl">Rav Yehudah:</span> R. Elazar ben Masya should have expounded a pearl. Instead, he expounded shards!</p>
<p class="bas indent1"><span class="nm">(i)</span><span class="cl">Question:</span> What pearl should he have expounded?</p>
<p class="bas indent1"><span class="nm">(j)</span><span class="cl">Answer (Beraisa):</span> "And a woman divorced from her husband (is forbidden to a Kohen)", even if she was only divorced from her husband (the Get says 'you are divorced from me but not permitted to others)!</p>
<p class="bas indent2"><span class="nm">1.</span>This is 'the scent of a Get' which forbids to Kehunah.</p>
<p class="bas subject"><span class="nm">2)</span>A MAN WHO MISTAKENLY MARRIED HIS WIFE'S SISTER</p>
<p class="bas indent1"><span class="nm">(a)</span><span class="cl">(Mishnah):</span> Reuven's wife Leah went overseas. They told him that she died; he married her sister Rachel. Later, Leah returned. She may return to him, and he is permitted to Rachel's relatives, and Rachel is permitted to his relatives. If Leah later died, he may marry Rachel;</p>
<p class="bas bbbline">94b----------------------------------------94b</p>
<p class="bas indent1"><span class="nm">(b)</span>If they told him that Leah died, he married Rachel, and they told him that really, she died after the Nisu'in to Rachel, the first child is a Mamzer, but the latter is not;</p>
<p class="bas indent1"><span class="nm">(c)</span>R. Yosi says, anyone who forbids others forbids to himself. Anyone who does not forbid others does not forbid to himself (this will be explained).</p>
<p class="bas indent1"><span class="nm">(d)</span><span class="cl">(Gemara) Inference:</span> The Mishnah applies even if Leah went abroad with Rachel's husband (and the witness said that both of them died), and when Reuven married Rachel, this forbade Rachel to her husband. Still, this marriage does not forbid Reuven to Leah.</p>
<p class="bas indent1"><span class="nm">(e)</span><span class="cl">Suggestion:</span> Our Mishnah is unlike R. Akiva. He would forbid Reuven to Leah, since she is the sister of his divorcee!</p>
<p class="bas indent2"><span class="nm">1.</span><span class="cl">(Beraisa):</span> The only Ervah that requires a Get (if married mistakenly) is an Eshes Ish who remarried according to Beis Din;</p>
<p class="bas indent2"><span class="nm">2.</span>R. Akiva adds Eshes Ach and Achos Ishto.</p>
<p class="bas indent2"><span class="nm">3.</span>Since Rachel needs a Get from Reuven, she is like his divorcee, so Reuven is forbidden to her sister Leah!</p>
<p class="bas indent1"><span class="nm">(f)</span><span class="cl">Rejection:</span> If we explain the Beraisa like Rav Gidal, the Mishnah can be like R. Akiva.</p>
<p class="bas indent2"><span class="nm">1.</span><span class="cl">(Rav Gidal):</span> The case of Eshes Ach who needs a Get is when Levi was Mekadesh Sarah, and he went overseas. Levi's brother Yehudah heard that Levi died, and Yehudah married (did Yibum with) Sarah.</p>
<p class="bas indent3"><span class="nm">i.</span>People will say that Levi's Kidushin was on condition and Yehudah properly married her.</p>
<p class="bas indent2"><span class="nm">2.</span>The case of Achos Ishto is similar. Levi was Mekadesh Sarah, and she went overseas. Levi heard that she died, and married her sister.</p>
<p class="bas indent3"><span class="nm">i.</span>People will say that Levi's Kidushin was on condition and he properly married her sister.</p>
<p class="bas indent2"><span class="nm">3.</span>Our Mishnah discusses Nisu'in. People will not say there was a condition by Nisu'in (the husband would not want to transgress Bi'as Zenus if the condition is not fulfilled), so R. Akiva agrees that no Get is needed.</p>
<p class="bas subject"><span class="nm">3)</span>A MOTHER-IN-LAW AFTER THE WIFE DIES</p>
<p class="bas indent1"><span class="nm">(a)</span><span class="cl">Question (Rav Ashi):</span> If the Mishnah is R. Akiva, it should also teach [about marrying] Chamoso (his mother-in-law) after he heard that his wife died. R. Akiva holds that one is not Chayav Misah for Chamoso after his wife dies!</p>
<p class="bas indent2"><span class="nm">1.</span><span class="cl">(Beraisa - R. Yishmael):</span> "You will burn him and them (a woman and her mother)" - him and one of them (the one whom he married after marrying the other);</p>
<p class="bas indent2"><span class="nm">2.</span>R. Akiva says, (we burn) him and both of them.</p>
<p class="bas indent2"><span class="nm">3.</span>We understand according to Abaye, who says that they agree about the Halachah, but argue only about how do derive it. R. Yishmael holds that the verse discusses only one Bi'as Isur. R. Akiva holds that it discusses marrying Chamoso and her mother.</p>
<p class="bas indent2"><span class="nm">4.</span>However, Rava says that they argue about Chamoso after one's wife dies (R. Akiva expounds that one is liable only if both women are still alive). R. Akiva should have taught also about Chamoso!</p>
<p class="bas indent1"><span class="nm">(b)</span><span class="cl">Answer (Rav Kahana):</span> Granted, R. Akiva says that one is not Chayav Misah for her, but the verse did not permit her!</p>
<p class="bas indent1"><span class="nm">(c)</span><span class="cl">Question:</span> Why doesn't Reuven become forbidden to his wife when he married Achos Ishto, just like a woman who married after she heard that her husband died?</p>
<p class="bas indent1"><span class="nm">(d)</span><span class="cl">Answer:</span> The cases are different. An Eshes Ish who is Mezanah b'Mezid is forbidden mid'Oraisa to her husband, so Chachamim decreed to forbid her for Shogeg;</p>
<p class="bas indent2"><span class="nm">1.</span>Zenus b'Mezid with Achos Ishto does not forbid one to his wife mid'Oraisa, so no decree was made for Shogeg.</p>
