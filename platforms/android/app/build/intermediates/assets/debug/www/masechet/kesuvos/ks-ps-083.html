<p class="bas subject"><span class="nm">1)</span>A MAN WHO WAIVED HIS RIGHTS TO HIS WIFE'S PROPERTY</p>
<p class="bas indent1"><span class="nm">(a)</span><span class="cl">(Mishnah):</span> If a man wrote to his wife 'I have no claim or dealings in your property', he eats the Peiros of her property in her lifetime, and inherits her if she dies;</p>
<p class="bas indent2"><span class="nm">1.</span><span class="cl">Question:</span> If so, why did he write this?</p>
<p class="bas indent2"><span class="nm">2.</span><span class="cl">Answer:</span> If she sold it or gave it away, it stands.</p>
<p class="bas indent1"><span class="nm">(b)</span>If he wrote 'I have no claim or dealings in your property nor in its Peiros', he does not eat the Peiros in her lifetime, but inherits the property if she dies;</p>
<p class="bas indent1"><span class="nm">(c)</span>R. Yehudah says, he always eats the Peiros of the Peiros, unless he writes, 'I have no claim or dealings in your property nor in its Peiros nor in the Peiros of its Peiros Ad Olam (ad infinitum)'.</p>
<p class="bas indent1"><span class="nm">(d)</span>If he wrote 'I have no claim or dealings in your property, nor in its Peiros, nor in the Peiros of its Peiros, in your lifetime and after your death', he does not eat the Peiros in her lifetime, and does not inherit her if she dies;</p>
<p class="bas indent1"><span class="nm">(e)</span>R. Shimon ben Gamliel says, if she dies he inherits her, because he stipulated contrary to Torah. Any stipulation contrary to Torah is void. (He holds that a husband inherits his wife mid'Oraisa.)</p>
<p class="bas indent1"><span class="nm">(f)</span><span class="cl">(Gemara - R. Chiya - Beraisa):</span> The Mishnah applies (even) if he only <i>said</i> this.</p>
<p class="bas indent1"><span class="nm">(g)</span><span class="cl">Question:</span> Even if he wrote this, why should it take effect?</p>
<p class="bas indent2"><span class="nm">1.</span><span class="cl">(Beraisa):</span> If a man wrote to his friend (Rashi - his partner) 'I have no claim or dealings in this field', 'I have no business in it', (or) 'my hand is removed from it', these words are void. (Since he already owns it, he must give a gift to transfer it.)</p>
<p class="bas indent1"><span class="nm">(h)</span><span class="cl">Answer (d'Vei R. Yanai):</span> The case is, he wrote to his wife during Eirusin. (He did not yet acquire her property.)</p>
<p class="bas indent1"><span class="nm">(i)</span>This is like the laws of Rav Kahana and Rava:</p>
<p class="bas indent2"><span class="nm">1.</span><span class="cl">(Rav Kahana):</span> One may stipulate not to inherit an inheritance that does not come through his ancestors (e.g. inheriting his wife).</p>
<p class="bas indent2"><span class="nm">2.</span><span class="cl">(Rava):</span> If one says 'I do not want Chachamim's enactment' <i>in a case like this</i> (the enactment was for his benefit), we heed him.</p>
<p class="bas indent2"><span class="nm">3.</span><span class="cl">Question:</span> What case did Rava refer to?</p>
<p class="bas indent2"><span class="nm">4.</span><span class="cl">Answer:</span> He referred to Rav Huna's law:</p>
<p class="bas indent3"><span class="nm">i.</span><span class="cl">(Rav Huna):</span> A woman can tell her husband 'Do not feed me and I will not work for you' (since the enactment that he feeds her and receives her productivity was for her benefit).</p>
<p class="bas indent1"><span class="nm">(j)</span><span class="cl">Question:</span> If this is like the laws of Rav Kahana and Rava, it should apply even if he wrote during Nisu'in!</p>
<p class="bas indent1"><span class="nm">(k)</span><span class="cl">Answer #1 (Abaye):</span> After Nisu'in, the husband's Yad (power of acquisition) is equal to his wife's Yad (in her property. He is like a partner, so it is not enough to merely renounce his rights.)</p>
<p class="bas indent1"><span class="nm">(l)</span><span class="cl">Answer #2 (Rava):</span> His Yad is stronger than her Yad.</p>
<p class="bas indent2"><span class="nm">1.</span>Abaye and Rava (do not argue here. They) only argue about (property that falls to) a Shomeres Yavam.</p>
<p class="bas indent1"><span class="nm">(m)</span><span class="cl">Question:</span> If he made a Kinyan (acquisition through transferring a Kli) to waive his claims (Rashi - to the field, in the Beraisa; Tosfos - to his Nesu'ah), is this binding?</p>
<p class="bas indent1"><span class="nm">(n)</span><span class="cl">Answer #1 (Rav Yosef):</span> The Kinyan was for claims (but the property is still his)!</p>
<p class="bas indent1"><span class="nm">(o)</span><span class="cl">Answer #2 (Rav Nachman):</span> The Kinyan was for the property itself.</p>
<p class="bas indent1"><span class="nm">(p)</span><span class="cl">(Abaye):</span> Presumably, Rav Yosef said only his law in a case when he immediately protested. If he protests only later, he agrees that he waived his rights to the property.</p>
<p class="bas bbbline">83b----------------------------------------83b</p>
<p class="bas indent1"><span class="nm">(q)</span><span class="cl">(Ameimar):</span> The Halachah is, he waived his rights to the property.</p>
<p class="bas indent1"><span class="nm">(r)</span><span class="cl">Question (Rav Ashi):</span> Is this when he protested later, or even if he protested right away?</p>
<p class="bas indent2"><span class="nm">1.</span>This determines whether Ameimar holds like Rav Yosef.</p>
<p class="bas indent1"><span class="nm">(s)</span><span class="cl">Answer (Ameimar):</span> I do not hold like Rav Yosef.</p>
<p class="bas subject"><span class="nm">2)</span>FROM WHAT DID HE WAIVE HIS RIGHTS?</p>
<p class="bas indent1"><span class="nm">(a)</span><span class="cl">(Mishnah):</span> If so, why did he write to her?...</p>
<p class="bas indent1"><span class="nm">(b)</span><span class="cl">Question:</span> She should be able to tell him that he waived all his rights!</p>
<p class="bas indent1"><span class="nm">(c)</span><span class="cl">Answer #1 (Abaye):</span> One who holds a document has the lower hand (we say that he waived the smallest right, i.e. that if she sold it, the sale stands).</p>
<p class="bas indent2"><span class="nm">1.</span><span class="cl">Suggestion:</span> Perhaps he waived the right to the Peiros (but keeps possession of the land itself)!!</p>
<p class="bas indent2"><span class="nm">2.</span><span class="cl">Rejection (Abaye):</span> It is better to have a small gourd now than rights to a large one later. (It is better to have produce now, and to allow a future sale to take effect, so we assume that this was his intent.)</p>
<p class="bas indent2"><span class="nm">3.</span><span class="cl">Suggestion:</span> Perhaps he waived the right to inherit her property! (This applies only if he outlives her.)</p>
<p class="bas indent2"><span class="nm">4.</span><span class="cl">Rejection (Abaye):</span> A person waives his right to something that is uncommon (that she will sell her property), and not to something common (that he will inherit her).</p>
<p class="bas indent1"><span class="nm">(d)</span><span class="cl">Answer #2 (Rav Ashi):</span> He wrote 'in your <i>property'</i> - not in its produce; 'in <i>your</i> property', not after your death (when it is no longer hers).</p>
<p class="bas indent1"><span class="nm">(e)</span><span class="cl">(Mishnah - R. Yehudah):</span> He always eats Peiros of the Peiros...</p>
<p class="bas indent1"><span class="nm">(f)</span><span class="cl">(Beraisa):</span> If she brings in land and it yields produce, they are Peiros. If he sold the produce and bought land, the produce of that land is Peiros of Peiros.</p>
<p class="bas indent1"><span class="nm">(g)</span><span class="cl">Question:</span> According to R. Yehudah, must he say 'Peiros of Peiros' or 'Ad Olam (ad infinitum)' or both?</p>
<p class="bas indent2"><span class="nm">1.</span><span class="cl">Question:</span> If he must say only 'Peiros of Peiros', why does the Mishnah say 'Ad Olam'?</p>
<p class="bas indent2"><span class="nm">2.</span><span class="cl">Answer:</span> This teaches that saying 'Peiros of Peiros' is like saying 'ad infinitum'.</p>
<p class="bas indent2"><span class="nm">3.</span><span class="cl">Question:</span> If he must say only 'Ad Olam', why does the Mishnah say 'Peiros of Peiros'?</p>
<p class="bas indent2"><span class="nm">4.</span><span class="cl">Answer:</span> This teaches that even though he said 'Peiros of Peiros', he must still say 'ad infinitum'.</p>
<p class="bas indent2"><span class="nm">5.</span><span class="cl">Question:</span> What is the rationale to require both?</p>
<p class="bas indent2"><span class="nm">6.</span><span class="cl">Answer:</span> If he says only 'Peiros of Peiros', perhaps he forfeits them, but eats Peiros of Peiros of Peiros. If he says only 'Ad Olam', perhaps (he does not mean 'ad infinitum', rather, forever, and) he permanently forfeits Peiros, but does not forfeit Peiros of Peiros.</p>
<p class="bas indent1"><span class="nm">(h)</span>(The Gemara did not explicitly answer the question. According to the Rambam and the Ge'onim who say that the Halachah follows every 'Im Timtzi Lomar', perhaps both must be said.)</p>
<p class="bas indent1"><span class="nm">(i)</span><span class="cl">Question:</span> If he wrote, 'I have no claim or dealings in your property, nor the Peiros of its Peiros', does he eat the Peiros?</p>
<p class="bas indent2"><span class="nm">1.</span>Did he waive his rights only to Peiros of Peiros, but not to Peiros?</p>
<p class="bas indent2"><span class="nm">2.</span>Or, perhaps he totally removed himself from the Peiros?</p>
<p class="bas indent1"><span class="nm">(j)</span><span class="cl">Answer:</span> Clearly, he totally removed himself. If he retained rights to the Peiros, he will eat them, and there will not be any Peiros of Peiros!</p>
<p class="bas indent1"><span class="nm">(k)</span><span class="cl">Rejection - Question:</span> If so, how will you explain the Mishnah? R. Yehudah says, he always eats the Peiros of Peiros... Since she eats the Peiros, there will not be Peiros of Peiros!</p>
<p class="bas indent2"><span class="nm">1.</span><span class="cl">Answer:</span> You must say that the Mishnah teaches the law for when she leaves over Peiros (and they were used to buy land). Similarly, perhaps he stipulates not to receive Peiros of Peiros if he will happen to leave over Peiros and use them to buy land!</p>
<p class="bas subject"><span class="nm">3)</span>CAN HE WAIVE HIS RIGHT TO INHERIT?</p>
<p class="bas indent1"><span class="nm">(a)</span><span class="cl">(Mishnah - R. Shimon ben Gamliel):</span> If she dies he inherits...</p>
<p class="bas indent1"><span class="nm">(b)</span><span class="cl">(Rav):</span> The Halachah follows R. Shimon ben Gamliel, but not for his reason.</p>
<p class="bas indent1"><span class="nm">(c)</span><span class="cl">Question:</span> What does Rav mean?</p>
<p class="bas indent1"><span class="nm">(d)</span><span class="cl">Answer #1:</span> Rav agrees that the Halachah is, if she dies, he inherits her. R. Shimon holds that a stipulation contrary to Torah is void, whereas Rav holds that such a stipulation is valid;</p>
<p class="bas indent2"><span class="nm">1.</span>Rav holds that a husband inherits mid'Rabanan, and Chachamim strengthened their enactment more than Torah laws (a stipulation against a mid'Rabanan law is void).</p>
