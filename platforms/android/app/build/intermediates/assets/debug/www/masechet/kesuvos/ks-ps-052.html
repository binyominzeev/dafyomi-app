<p class="dedicationbox">KESUVOS 52 - Two weeks of study material have been dedicated by Mrs. Estanne Abraham Fawer to honor the Yahrzeit of her father, Rav Mordechai ben Eliezer Zvi (Rabbi Morton Weiner) Z'L, who passed away on 18 Teves 5760. May the merit of supporting and advancing Dafyomi study -- which was so important to him -- during the weeks of his Yahrzeit serve as an Iluy for his Neshamah. </p>

<p class="bas subject"><span class="nm">1)</span>WHO MUST BE REDEEMED</p>
<p class="bas indent1"><span class="nm">(a)</span><span class="cl">(Mishnah):</span> A Kohen writes 'If you will be captured, I will return you to your land.'</p>
<p class="bas indent1"><span class="nm">(b)</span><span class="cl">(Abaye):</span> If a Kohen Gadol married a widow, he must redeem her. We apply to her, or to any Kohen's wife (who becomes forbidden when captured) 'I will return you to your land.'</p>
<p class="bas indent1"><span class="nm">(c)</span>If a Mamzeres or Nesinah was married to a Yisrael, he need not redeem her, since 'I will return you for a wife' does not apply.</p>
<p class="bas indent1"><span class="nm">(d)</span><span class="cl">(Rava):</span> Whenever the captivity caused her to be forbidden to her husband, he must redeem her. If she was forbidden without this (e.g. a widow to a Kohen Gadol), he is exempt.</p>
<p class="bas indent1"><span class="nm">(e)</span><span class="cl">Suggestion:</span> Tana'im argue like Abaye and Rava:</p>
<p class="bas indent2"><span class="nm">1.</span><span class="cl">(Beraisa - R. Eliezer):</span> If one forbade his wife through a vow, and she was captured, he redeems her and gives to her a Kesuvah;</p>
<p class="bas indent2"><span class="nm">2.</span>R. Yehoshua says, he need not redeem her, but must pay a Kesuvah;</p>
<p class="bas indent2"><span class="nm">3.</span><span class="cl">Question (R. Nasan):</span> Does R. Yehoshua discuss when the vow preceded the captivity, or when it came later?</p>
<p class="bas indent2"><span class="nm">4.</span><span class="cl">Answer (Sumchus):</span> I did not hear, but presumably, the vow came first. If not, he will scheme (he will vow to exempt himself of the obligation to redeem her)!</p>
<p class="bas indent2"><span class="nm">5.</span><span class="cl">Suggestion:</span> The Tana'im argue about a Kohen. (R. Eliezer would not obligate a Yisrael to redeem her, since 'I will return you for a wife' does not apply.) Abaye holds like R. Eliezer, and Rava holds like R. Yehoshua.</p>
<p class="bas indent1"><span class="nm">(f)</span><span class="cl">Rejection:</span> No, (they discuss a Yisrael;) the case is, she forbade herself to him through a vow and he confirmed the vow;</p>
<p class="bas indent2"><span class="nm">1.</span>R. Eliezer holds that he is to blame (for confirming it). R. Yehoshua says that she is to blame.</p>
<p class="bas indent1"><span class="nm">(g)</span><span class="cl">Objection #1:</span> If R. Yehoshua blames her, her husband should not need to pay a Kesuvah!</p>
<p class="bas indent1"><span class="nm">(h)</span><span class="cl">Objection #2:</span> If R. Yehoshua says that she is to blame, why did R. Nasan ask whether the vow preceded the captivity? It makes no difference!</p>
<p class="bas indent1"><span class="nm">(i)</span><span class="cl">Retraction:</span> Rather, he vowed. Abaye and Rava argue according to both Tana'im:</p>
<p class="bas indent2"><span class="nm">1.</span>Abaye says that all agree that a Kohen Gadol must redeem a widow, but a Yisrael need not redeem a Mamzeres or Nesinah. A Kohen who vowed must redeem his wife, just like the Kohen Gadol.</p>
<p class="bas indent3"><span class="nm">i.</span>They argue about a Yisrael who vowed. R. Eliezer goes according to the beginning (when he wrote the Kesuvah 'I will return you as a wife' applied). R. Yehoshua goes according to the end (when she was captured, he could not return her to be a wife).</p>
<p class="bas indent2"><span class="nm">2.</span>Rava says that all agree that a Kohen Gadol married to a widow or a Yisrael married to a Mamzeres or Nesinah need not redeem her;</p>
<p class="bas indent3"><span class="nm">i.</span>They argue about a Kohen or Yisrael who vowed. R. Eliezer goes according to the beginning (when he wrote the Kesuvah, there was no other Isur). R. Yehoshua goes according to the end (without the captivity, she is forbidden due to the vow).</p>
<p class="bas indent1"><span class="nm">(j)</span><span class="cl">(Beraisa):</span> If she was captured in his lifetime, and he died, the heirs must redeem her only if he had heard that she was captured.</p>
<p class="bas indent1"><span class="nm">(k)</span>Levi was ready to rule in a case like this Beraisa.</p>
<p class="bas indent1"><span class="nm">(l)</span><span class="cl">(Rav citing R. Chiya):</span> The Halachah does not follow this Beraisa. Rather, it is like the following Beraisa:</p>
<p class="bas indent2"><span class="nm">1.</span><span class="cl">(Beraisa):</span> If she was captured after the husband died, or even during his lifetime and he died, the heirs need not redeem her, since 'I will return you to be my wife' does not apply.</p>
<p class="bas subject"><span class="nm">2)</span>HOW MUCH MUST HE PAY TO REDEEM HER?</p>
<p class="bas indent1"><span class="nm">(a)</span><span class="cl">(Beraisa):</span> If the captors demanded up to 10 times her value, the first time, he must redeem her. After this, it is his choice;</p>
<p class="bas bbbline">52b----------------------------------------52b</p>
<p class="bas indent1"><span class="nm">(b)</span>R. Shimon ben Gamliel says, we do not redeem captives for more than their value (to be sold for slaves). This is an enactment to fix the world (lest we encourage captors to ask for exorbitant amounts);</p>
<p class="bas indent1"><span class="nm">(c)</span><span class="cl">Inference:</span> Up to her value we redeem, even if it exceeds her Kesuvah!</p>
<p class="bas indent1"><span class="nm">(d)</span><span class="cl">Contradiction (Beraisa):</span> If the captors demanded up to 10 times her Kesuvah, the first time, he must redeem her. After this, it is his choice;</p>
<p class="bas indent2"><span class="nm">1.</span>R. Shimon ben Gamliel says, if her redemption does not exceed her Kesuvah, he must redeem her. If it is more, he is exempt.</p>
<p class="bas indent1"><span class="nm">(e)</span><span class="cl">Answer:</span> R. Shimon ben Gamliel is lenient both ways. (One need not pay more than her value, nor more than her Kesuvah.)</p>
<p class="bas subject"><span class="nm">3)</span>HEALING HER</p>
<p class="bas indent1"><span class="nm">(a)</span><span class="cl">(Mishnah):</span> If she gets sick, he must heal her.</p>
<p class="bas indent1"><span class="nm">(b)</span><span class="cl">(Beraisa):</span> A widow is fed from the orphans. Medical expenses are like food;</p>
<p class="bas indent1"><span class="nm">(c)</span>R. Shimon ben Gamliel says, medical expenses with a limit are taken from her Kesuvah. If there is no limit, they are like food.</p>
<p class="bas indent1"><span class="nm">(d)</span><span class="cl">(R. Yochanan):</span> In Eretz Yisrael, bloodletting is considered to be unlimited.</p>
<p class="bas indent1"><span class="nm">(e)</span>R. Yochanan's relatives lost their father; the widow had daily medical expenses. He advised them to get a doctor to fix a price to treat her permanently (so it will be deducted from the Kesuvah).</p>
<p class="bas indent2"><span class="nm">1.</span><span class="cl">R. Yochanan:</span> I acted like a lawyer (which is wrong - Avos 1:8).</p>
<p class="bas indent1"><span class="nm">(f)</span><span class="cl">Question:</span> Why did he initially advise them, and later regret it?</p>
<p class="bas indent1"><span class="nm">(g)</span><span class="cl">Answer:</span> Initially, he thought that he should fulfill "Do not hide from your flesh (kin)." Later, he thought that an important person should not do so (his counsel hurt the widow).</p>
<p class="bas subject"><span class="nm">4)</span>THE <i>KESUVAH</i> PASSES TO HER SONS</p>
<p class="bas indent1"><span class="nm">(a)</span><span class="cl">(Mishnah):</span> The following enactments of Beis Din apply, even if they were not written in the Kesuvah:</p>
<p class="bas indent2"><span class="nm">1.</span>'Your sons from me will inherit the money of your Kesuvah together will their portion with their brothers (from other wives)';</p>
<p class="bas indent2"><span class="nm">2.</span>'Your daughters from me will live in my house and be fed from my property until they get married';</p>
<p class="bas indent2"><span class="nm">3.</span>'You will live in my house and be fed from my property all the days of your widowhood in my house.'</p>
<p class="bas indent2"><span class="nm">4.</span>People in Yerushalayim and Galil wrote this. In Yehudah, they wrote '...until the heirs want to pay your Kesuvah.' Therefore, if they wanted they could pay her Kesuvah and end her privileges.</p>
<p class="bas indent1"><span class="nm">(b)</span><span class="cl">(Gemara - R. Yochanan):</span> Chachamim enacted 'Kesuvas Benin Dichrin' (that sons inherit their mother's Kesuvah) to encourage men to give property to their daughters, like to their sons. (Amram is hesitant to give a dowry to his daughter (Miryam), lest she die before her husband (Kalev), and part or most of the dowry will be inherited by Kalev's sons from other wives.)</p>
<p class="bas indent1"><span class="nm">(c)</span><span class="cl">Question:</span> The Torah says that a son inherits and not a daughter. Would Chachamim enact (to encourage fathers to give) as if a daughter inherits?!</p>
<p class="bas indent1"><span class="nm">(d)</span><span class="cl">Answer:</span> The Torah says that a man should give to his daughter - "Take wives for your sons and give your daughters to men";</p>
<p class="bas indent2"><span class="nm">1.</span><span class="cl">Question:</span> Granted, it is normal for a man to seek a girl (for himself or for his son). But it is not normal (for a woman, or a man on behalf of his daughter) to seek a man!</p>
<p class="bas indent2"><span class="nm">2.</span><span class="cl">Answer:</span> The verse teaches that one should give to daughters clothing and property so men will want to marry them.</p>
<p class="bas indent1"><span class="nm">(e)</span><span class="cl">Question:</span> How much should he give?</p>
<p class="bas indent1"><span class="nm">(f)</span><span class="cl">Answer (Abaye and Rava):</span> He should give up to a tenth of his property.</p>
<p class="bas indent1"><span class="nm">(g)</span><span class="cl">Question:</span> (If the enactment was to encourage dowries,) it should apply to only to the dowry that her father (Amram) gave, but not to what the husband (Kalev) pays! (The Ikar Kesuvah of 100 or 200 should be inherited by all his sons.)</p>
<p class="bas indent1"><span class="nm">(h)</span><span class="cl">Answer:</span> If her sons would not (exclusively) inherit also from her husband, Amram would not want to give.</p>
<p class="bas indent1"><span class="nm">(i)</span><span class="cl">Question:</span> We should say that her sons exclusively inherit what the husband pays only when Amram gave a dowry!</p>
<p class="bas indent1"><span class="nm">(j)</span><span class="cl">Answer:</span> Chachamim made a uniform decree.</p>
<p class="bas indent1"><span class="nm">(k)</span><span class="cl">Question:</span> If Miryam has a daughter but no sons, her daughter should inherit the Kesuvah, even when Kalev has sons from other wives!</p>
<p class="bas indent1"><span class="nm">(l)</span><span class="cl">Answer:</span> Chachamim made their enactment like an inheritance (daughters do not inherit when there are sons).</p>
<p class="bas indent1"><span class="nm">(m)</span><span class="cl">Question:</span> When Kalev has only daughters, Miryam's daughter should (exclusively) inherit her mother's Kesuvah!</p>
<p class="bas indent1"><span class="nm">(n)</span><span class="cl">Answer:</span> Chachamim made a uniform decree.</p>
<p class="bas indent1"><span class="nm">(o)</span><span class="cl">Question:</span> It should be collected from Metaltelim as well!</p>
<p class="bas indent1"><span class="nm">(p)</span><span class="cl">Answer:</span> Chachamim made the enactment like a Kesuvah.</p>
<p class="bas indent1"><span class="nm">(q)</span><span class="cl">Question:</span> Miryam should be able to seize (on behalf of her sons) property that Kalev sold!</p>
<p class="bas indent1"><span class="nm">(r)</span><span class="cl">Answer:</span> The Mishnah says 'they <i>inherit'</i> (heirs do not receive property that was sold).</p>
<p class="bas indent1"><span class="nm">(s)</span><span class="cl">Question:</span> The enactment should apply even if Kalev does not leave more property than his wives' Kesuvos!</p>
<p class="bas indent1"><span class="nm">(t)</span><span class="cl">Answer:</span> Chachamim did not enact in a case where inheritance mid'Oraisa will be uprooted.</p>
