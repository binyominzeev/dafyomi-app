<div class="subject"><span class="nm">1)</span><p>NOCHRIM EXEMPT FROM KEDUSHAS BECHOR</p></div>
<div class="indent1"><span class="nm">(a)</span><p><span class="cl">(Mishnah):</span> (Normally, one must redeem a Peter Chamor (a firstborn donkey, by giving its value or a Seh (goat or sheep) to a Kohen). If not, he must do Arifah (break its neck).) In the following cases, a Peter Chamor is exempt (from redemption or Arifah):</p></div>
<div class="indent2"><span class="nm">1.</span><p>One bought the fetus in a Nochri's donkey;</p></div>
<div class="indent2"><span class="nm">2.</span><p>One sold the fetus in his donkey to a Nochri, even though this is forbidden;</p></div>
<div class="indent2"><span class="nm">3.</span><p>One was a partner with a Nochri in a donkey;</p></div>
<div class="indent2"><span class="nm">4.</span><p>One was Mekabel from a Nochri (to take care of his donkey, and share the offspring), or he gave his donkey to a Nochri b'Kabalah.</p></div>
<div class="indent1"><span class="nm">(b)</span><p>We learn from "b'Yisrael" -- not of others.</p></div>
<div class="indent1"><span class="nm">(c)</span><p><span class="cl">(Gemara) Question:</span> Why must the Mishnah teach all of these cases?</p></div>
<div class="indent1"><span class="nm">(d)</span><p><span class="cl">Answer:</span> All are needed;</p></div>
<div class="indent2"><span class="nm">1.</span><p>Had it only taught only about one who bought a fetus, we would think that then it is exempt, for he (did not transgress, he even) increased its Kedushah (Tosfos -- if the fetus is a female, Kedushas Bechor will apply to its offspring), but one who sold his fetus is fined (he must buy it back to redeem it), for he uprooted Kedushas Bechor from it;</p></div>
<div class="indent2"><span class="nm">2.</span><p><span class="cl">Question:</span> Why must it teach about one who was a partner with a Nochri?</p></div>
<div class="indent2"><span class="nm">3.</span><p><span class="cl">Answer:</span> Chachamim teach unlike R. Yehudah, who says that Kedushas Bechor applies in this case.</p></div>
<div class="indent2"><span class="nm">4.</span><p><span class="cl">Question:</span> Why must it teach about one who was Mekabel from a Nochri?</p></div>
<div class="indent2"><span class="nm">5.</span><p><span class="cl">Answer:</span> This is for parallel structure with the last case, in which a Nochri was Mekabel one's donkey.</p></div>
<div class="indent2"><span class="nm">6.</span><p><span class="cl">Question:</span> Why must it teach about giving to a Nochri b'Kabalah?</p></div>
<div class="indent2"><span class="nm">7.</span><p><span class="cl">Answer:</span> One might have thought that since the mother primarily belongs to the Yisrael, we fine him (to buy it back to redeem it), lest this be confused with a regular case (in which the Yisrael owns everything).</p></div>
<div class="subject"><span class="nm">2)</span><p>SELLING A FETUS TO A NOCHRI</p></div>
<div class="indent1"><span class="nm">(a)</span><p>(In all places a Yisrael is forbidden to sell a large (i.e. work) animal to Nochrim. This is a decree, lest he sell just before Shabbos and (on Shabbos) show the Nochri how to call to it to make it go, (and transgress making an animal work on Shabbos), or lest he rent to Nochrim. (A Yisrael is commanded that his animals rest on Shabbos). In some places, the custom is to permit selling small animals to Nochrim. In other places, it is forbidden.)</p></div>
<div class="indent1"><span class="nm">(b)</span><p><span class="cl">Version #1 (Mishnah - R. Yehudah):</span> It is permitted to sell a Shevurah (lame animal) to Nochrim;</p></div>
<div class="indent1"><span class="nm">(c)</span><p>Ben Beseira permits selling a horse.</p></div>
<div class="indent1"><span class="nm">(d)</span><p><span class="cl">Question:</span> Does R. Yehudah permit selling a fetus to a Nochri?</p></div>
<div class="indent2"><span class="nm">1.</span><p>Perhaps he permits a Shevurah because it cannot work. The same applies to a fetus!</p></div>
<div class="indent2"><span class="nm">2.</span><p>Or, perhaps he permits a Shevurah because it is unusual (and people will not come to sell a Bari (healthy animal).) If so, one may not sell a fetus (for it is normal).</p></div>
<div class="indent1"><span class="nm">(e)</span><p><span class="cl">Answer #1 (Mishnah):</span> ... If one sold the fetus in his donkey to a Nochri, even though this is forbidden;</p></div>
<div class="indent2"><span class="nm">1.</span><p>R. Yehudah does not argue!</p></div>
<div class="indent1"><span class="nm">(f)</span><p><span class="cl">Objection:</span> If so, you should also infer that he does not argue about partnership, Kabalah from a Nochri or giving to a Nochri b'Kabalah!</p></div>
<div class="indent2"><span class="nm">1.</span><p>We know that he argues (at least about partnership). Likewise, he can argue about selling a fetus.</p></div>
<div class="indent1"><span class="nm">(g)</span><p><span class="cl">Answer #2 (Beraisa - R. Yehudah):</span> If Reuven was Mekabel from a Nochri and it gave birth, we estimate its value. He gives half of this to a Kohen;</p></div>
<div class="indent2"><span class="nm">1.</span><p>If he gave to a Nochri b'Kabalah, even though this is forbidden, he is fined (and must buy it back for up to) 10 times its value, he gives its full value to a Kohen.</p></div>
<div class="bbbline">2b----------------------------------------2b</p></div>
<div class="indent2"><span class="nm">2.</span><p><span class="cl">Suggestion:</span> R. Yehudah discusses giving a fetus to a Nochri b'Kabalah. (The Mekabel has no stake in the mother).</p></div>
<div class="indent1"><span class="nm">(h)</span><p><span class="cl">Rejection #1:</span> No, he discusses giving a female (not pregnant) b'Kabalah for its offspring.</p></div>
<div class="indent2"><span class="nm">1.</span><p><span class="cl">Question:</span> It says "Damav" (the masculine form for "its value.") Surely he discusses giving a fetus!</p></div>
<div class="indent2"><span class="nm">2.</span><p><span class="cl">Answer:</span> It should say "Dameha" (the feminine form).</p></div>
<div class="indent2"><span class="nm">3.</span><p><span class="cl">Objection:</span> If the mother was given (and Reuven must buy it back), why is it given to Kohanim?!</p></div>
<div class="indent1"><span class="nm">(i)</span><p><span class="cl">Rejection #2:</span> Rather, he gave a pregnant female to a Nochri to fatten it (the Nochri gets half of the increased value and offspring);</p></div>
<div class="indent2"><span class="nm">1.</span><p>Since we fine him regarding the mother (he must buy it back), we also fine him regarding the fetus. (He must give its full value to a Kohen, lest he benefit from uprooting Kedushas Bechor.)</p></div>
<div class="indent1"><span class="nm">(j)</span><p><span class="cl">Answer #2 (Rav Ashi - Beraisa - R. Yehudah):</span> One may sell a Shevurah, because it cannot heal.</p></div>

<div class="indent1"><span class="nm">(a)</span><p>(If one sold a large animal (i.e. a species that works) to a Nochri, he is fined. He must buy it back for up to 10 times its value.)</p></div>

<div class="indent2"><span class="nm">2.</span><p>R. Yehudah permits selling a Shevurah, for (this is unusual, so) people will not confuse this with (and come to sell) a Bari. Here people might confuse this (a sale for offspring) with a full sale, so he should be fined;</p></div>
<div class="indent3"><span class="nm">i.</span><p>Or, since R. Yehudah permits selling a Shevurah absolutely, all the more so here, when he retains some ownership!</p></div>

<div class="indent3"><span class="nm">i.</span><p>Or, since they forbid selling a Shevurah, even though people are not likely to get confused, all the more so they forbid here (like a full sale, and fine)!</p></div>

<div class="indent3"><span class="nm">i.</span><p><span class="cl">(Beraisa):</span> Chachamim asked R. Yehudah "(why do you permit a female Shevurah?) The Nochri will leave it to mate and have offspring!"</p></div>
<div class="indent3"><span class="nm">ii.</span><p>This shows that they forbid (and fine) because (he will leave it for the sake) of offspring (but not because of confusion)!</p></div>

<div class="indent3"><span class="nm">i.</span><p>We forbid due to confusion. Why do you permit?</p></div>
<div class="indent3"><span class="nm">ii.</span><p>Presumably, since it cannot be healed, you consider it as if he bought it to eat immediately. Perhaps he wants it for offspring, and he will keep it for a long time!</p></div>

<div class="indent2"><span class="nm">4.</span><p><span class="cl">Question:</span> Why does it mention the Isur to sell, and not the Isurim of partnership or giving b'Kabalah?</p></div>
