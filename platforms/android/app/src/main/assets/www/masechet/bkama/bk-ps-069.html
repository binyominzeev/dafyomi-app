<p class="bas subject"><span class="nm">1)</span>CAN ONE BE <i>MAKDISH</i> WHAT IS NOT IN HIS DOMAIN?</p>
<p class="bas indent1"><span class="nm">(a)</span><span class="cl">(R. Yochanan):</span> If something was stolen and the owner did not despair, neither the thief nor owner can make it Hekdesh;</p>
<p class="bas indent2"><span class="nm">1.</span>The thief cannot, for it is not his. The owner cannot, for it is not in his Reshus!</p>
<p class="bas indent1"><span class="nm">(b)</span><span class="cl">Contradiction:</span> R. Yochanan said that the Halachah follows an anonymous Mishnah!</p>
<p class="bas indent2"><span class="nm">1.</span><span class="cl">(Mishnah #1):</span> People used to mark off Reva'i with clods off earth.</p>
<p class="bas indent3"><span class="nm">i.</span>The symbolism was, just like we can benefit from earth, also from these fruits (after redeeming them).</p>
<p class="bas indent2"><span class="nm">2.</span>They would mark off Orlah (fruits in the first three years) with pottery shards.</p>
<p class="bas indent3"><span class="nm">i.</span><span class="cl">This was a sign:</span> just like shards give no benefit, also these fruits.</p>
<p class="bas indent2"><span class="nm">3.</span>Graves were marked off with limestone. This signified bones, which are also white.</p>
<p class="bas indent2"><span class="nm">4.</span>R. Shimon ben Gamliel says, this was only in Shemitah, when people may enter others' fields. In other years, one who enters another's field is a thief. We are not concerned if the food he steals is forbidden!</p>
<p class="bas indent2"><span class="nm">5.</span>The Tzenu'im would take coins and say 'whatever (Reva'i) was gathered from my field is redeemed on these coins.' (Even though the Reva'i is not in their Reshus, they were able to redeem it. This shows that one can be Makdish something not in his Reshus!)</p>
<p class="bas indent2"><span class="nm">6.</span><span class="cl">Suggestion:</span> Perhaps Tzenu'im hold like R. Shimon ben Gamliel, and R. Yochanan holds like Chachamim.</p>
<p class="bas indent2"><span class="nm">7.</span><span class="cl">Rejection:</span> Rabah bar bar Chanah cited R. Yochanan to say that wherever R. Shimon ben Gamliel appears in the Mishnah, the Halachah follows him, except for (three Mishnayos:) a guarantor, the case in Tzidon, and one who later found a proof.</p>
<p class="bas indent1"><span class="nm">(c)</span><span class="cl">Answer #1:</span> The text of the Mishnah should say 'whatever will be gathered from my field is redeemed on these coins.'</p>
<p class="bas indent1"><span class="nm">(d)</span><span class="cl">Question:</span> R. Yochanan said that Tzenu'im and R. Dosa hold like each other, and R. Dosa holds that they said so after it was gathered (regarding poor people gathering Leket, i.e. what falls at the time of harvest);</p>
<p class="bas indent2"><span class="nm">1.</span><span class="cl">(Beraisa - R. Yehudah):</span> In the morning, the owner says 'what the poor will gather today (mistakenly, thinking that it is Leket) is (now) Hefker';</p>
<p class="bas indent2"><span class="nm">2.</span>R. Dosa says, at evening he says 'what the poor gathered is Hefker'.</p>
<p class="bas indent1"><span class="nm">(e)</span><span class="cl">Answer #1:</span> We must switch the opinions of R. Yehudah and R. Dosa.</p>
<p class="bas indent1"><span class="nm">(f)</span><span class="cl">Question:</span> It is better to switch the words of R. Yochanan, and say that he taught that Tzenu'im and R. Yehudah hold like each other!</p>
<p class="bas indent1"><span class="nm">(g)</span><span class="cl">Answer:</span> In any case, the Beraisa must be switched. According to our text, R. Yehudah holds that Yesh Bereirah (one can stipulate that things take effect based on future events, e.g. which Peros the poor will take.) We know that R. Yehudah holds that Ein Bereirah!</p>

<p class="bas subject"><span class="nm">2)</span>BEREIRAH</p>
<p class="bas indent1"><span class="nm">(a)</span><span class="cl">(Mishnah - R. Meir):</span> (The Kusim were converts who transgress many Mitzvos; they were suspected not to tithe.) If one buys (100 Lugim of) wine from Kusim (and cannot separate the tithes before drinking), he says: the two Lugim that I will later separate should be Terumah. Ten Lugim (that I will separate) are Ma'aser Rishon. Nine Lugim are Ma'aser Sheni. He is Meichal (Rashi - redeems the Ma'aser Sheni) and may drink immediately;</p>
<p class="bas indent2"><span class="nm">1.</span>R. Yehudah, R. Yosi and R. Shimon forbid (to drink before separating the tithes).</p>
<p class="bas indent1"><span class="nm">(b)</span><span class="cl">Question:</span> Even after switching the Beraisa, R. Yochanan still contradicts himself!</p>
<p class="bas indent2"><span class="nm">1.</span>R. Yochanan changed the text to read 'that will be gathered.' This shows that he holds that Yesh Bereirah;</p>
<p class="bas indent2"><span class="nm">2.</span><span class="cl">(Rav Asi citing R. Yochanan):</span> Brothers who divide an inheritance are like buyers (we do not know which share each inherits. Whatever each takes is like a purchase, in place of what his brother took from him), so they must re-divide in Yovel (when all sold land reverts to the seller).</p>
<p class="bas indent1"><span class="nm">(c)</span><span class="cl">Answer #2 (to question 1:b above):</span> Really, R. Yochanan leaves the text 'was gathered.' He holds like a Stam Mishnah that argues with Mishnah #1 (of Tzenu'im).</p>
<p class="bas indent2"><span class="nm">1.</span><span class="cl">(Mishnah #2):</span> One who steals from a thief does not pay Kefel. If he then slaughters or sells it, he does not pay four and five.</p>
<p class="bas indent2"><span class="nm">2.</span>We understand why he doesn't pay Kefel to the first thief - "and was stolen from the man's house", not from the house of the thief;</p>
<p class="bas indent2"><span class="nm">3.</span><span class="cl">Question:</span> Why doesn't he pay Kefel to the owner?</p>
<p class="bas indent2"><span class="nm">4.</span><span class="cl">Answer:</span> He doesn't pay the thief, for it is not the thief's. He doesn't pay the owner, for it was not in his Reshus. (For the same reason, neither can make it Hekdesh.)</p>
<p class="bas indent1"><span class="nm">(d)</span><span class="cl">Question:</span> Why does R. Yochanan rule like Mishnah #2 against Mishnah #1?</p>
<p class="bas indent1"><span class="nm">(e)</span><span class="cl">Answer:</span> A verse supports it - "if a man will make his house Hekdesh." One can be Makdish only things like his house, which is in his Reshus.</p>
<p class="bas subject"><span class="nm">3)</span><i>TZENU'IM</i> AND R. DOSA</p>
<p class="bas indent1"><span class="nm">(a)</span><span class="cl">Abaye:</span> I would have said differently than R. Yochanan. Tzenu'im hold like R. Dosa, but R. Dosa does not hold like Tzenu'im!</p>
<p class="bas indent2"><span class="nm">1.</span>Tzenu'im hold like R. Dosa. If Chachamim made an enactment for thieves (so they not transgress eating Reva'i), all the more so for the poor (who did not intentionally sin)!</p>
<p class="bas indent2"><span class="nm">2.</span>R. Dosa does not hold like Tzenu'im. Chachamim made an enactment for the poor, but not for thieves.</p>
<p class="bas indent1"><span class="nm">(b)</span><span class="cl">Rava:</span> I would have said differently than R. Yochanan. Tzenu'im hold like R. Meir;</p>
<p class="bas indent2"><span class="nm">1.</span>R. Meir says that Ma'aser Sheni is like Hash-m's money, but regarding redemption, it is considered a person's money;</p>
<p class="bas indent2"><span class="nm">2.</span>"If a man will redeem his Ma'aser, he will add its fifth" - the Torah calls it his Ma'aser, and he adds a fifth;</p>
<p class="bas indent2"><span class="nm">3.</span>The same applies to Reva'i of grapes. We learn a Gezeirah Shavah "Kodesh-Kodesh" from Ma'aser!</p>
<p class="bas indent3"><span class="nm">i.</span>Ma'aser is like Hash-m's money, but regarding redemption, it is considered a person's money. The same applies to Reva'i.</p>
<p class="bas indent2"><span class="nm">4.</span>However, when the poor take what they (mistakenly) think is Leket, that is the owner's money. He cannot redeem it when it is not in his Reshus! (Tzenu'im could argue with R. Dosa.)</p>
<p class="bas indent1"><span class="nm">(c)</span><span class="cl">Ravina:</span> R. Yochanan should have said that R. Dosa is the Tana of Mishnah #1;</p>
<p class="bas indent2"><span class="nm">1.</span>This would answer why he holds like Mishnah #2, unlike Mishnah #1. R. Yochanan's rule that the Halachah follows a Stam Mishnah does not apply when we find the law of the Mishnah attributed to a particular Tana.</p>
