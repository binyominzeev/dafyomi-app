<p class="bas subject"><span class="nm">1)</span>SUSPECTED THIEVES</p>
<p class="bas indent1"><span class="nm">(a)</span><span class="cl">(Mishnah):</span> We may not buy from people who guard fruit...</p>
<p class="bas indent1"><span class="nm">(b)</span>Rava bought a bundle of vine shoots from a sharecropper.</p>
<p class="bas indent1"><span class="nm">(c)</span><span class="cl">Abaye:</span> The Mishnah forbids buying fruit or wood from people who guard fruit!</p>
<p class="bas indent1"><span class="nm">(d)</span><span class="cl">Rava:</span> It refers to guardians, who receive no share of the Peros. Sharecroppers receive a share of the Peros, we may suppose that they sell from their share.</p>
<p class="bas indent1"><span class="nm">(e)</span><span class="cl">(Beraisa):</span> We may buy from people who guard fruit when they sit and sell with the baskets and big scales in front of them;</p>
<p class="bas indent2"><span class="nm">1.</span>If the seller says to conceal it, it is always forbidden.</p>
<p class="bas indent1"><span class="nm">(f)</span>We may buy from them at the entrance to the garden, but not in back of it.</p>
<p class="bas indent1"><span class="nm">(g)</span><span class="cl">Question:</span> When may one buy from a thief?</p>
<p class="bas indent1"><span class="nm">(h)</span><span class="cl">Answer #1 (Rav):</span> One may buy only if the majority of what he sells is his.</p>
<p class="bas indent1"><span class="nm">(i)</span><span class="cl">Answer #2 (Shmuel):</span> One may buy even if the minority is his.</p>
<p class="bas indent2"><span class="nm">1.</span>Rav Yehudah ruled like Shmuel.</p>
<p class="bas indent1"><span class="nm">(j)</span><span class="cl">(Rav Huna or Rav Yehudah):</span> One may destroy property of a Moser (one who shows others' money to people who will take it by force).</p>
<p class="bas indent1"><span class="nm">(k)</span><span class="cl">(The other of Rav Huna and Rav Yehudah):</span> One may not destroy his property.</p>
<p class="bas indent2"><span class="nm">1.</span>One permits, for one may even kill a Moser, all the more so one may destroy his money!</p>
<p class="bas indent2"><span class="nm">2.</span>One forbids, lest he will have a righteous heir - "the Rasha prepares, and the Tzadik will wear".</p>
<p class="bas indent1"><span class="nm">(l)</span>Rav Chisda's sharecropper was meticulous to take his full share (alternatively, he took more than he was entitled to. Maharsha challenges the first explanation, for one who takes his exact share is not called a Rasha. Ben Yehoyada - he would weigh Rav Chisda's share while the grain was moist, and take the same weight for his own share after it dried.)</p>
<p class="bas indent1"><span class="nm">(m)</span>Rav Chisda fired him, and kept his portion - "the wealth of the sinner waits (to pass to) the Tzadik".</p>
<p class="bas subject"><span class="nm">2)</span>THEFT IS LIKE MURDER</p>
<p class="bas indent1"><span class="nm">(a)</span><span class="cl">(Rav Huna or Rav Chisda):</span> "What is the hope of an evildoer when he steals? Hash-m Yeshel his soul" - Hash-m will give serenity to the soul of his victim;</p>
<p class="bas indent2"><span class="nm">1.</span>He learns from "the way of a thief, he takes the owner's soul."</p>
<p class="bas indent1"><span class="nm">(b)</span><span class="cl">(The other of Rav Huna and Rav Chisda):</span> It means, Hash-m will cast off the thief's soul.</p>
<p class="bas indent2"><span class="nm">1.</span>He learns from "do not steal from a poor person because he is poor, or afflict the Oni in the gate. Hash-m will wage their battle and Kova Es Kov'eihem Nafesh (mortally avenge the one who afflicted them)."</p>
<p class="bas indent1"><span class="nm">(c)</span><span class="cl">Question:</span> How does the latter opinion explain the first verse?</p>
<p class="bas indent1"><span class="nm">(d)</span><span class="cl">Answer:</span> Hash-m will take the (thief's i.e. the) current owner's soul."</p>
<p class="bas indent1"><span class="nm">(e)</span><span class="cl">Question:</span> How does the first opinion explain the latter verse?</p>
<p class="bas indent1"><span class="nm">(f)</span><span class="cl">Answer:</span> It explains why Hash-m will avenge the thief, i.e. for he mortally afflicts his victims.</p>
<p class="bas indent1"><span class="nm">(g)</span><span class="cl">(R. Yochanan):</span> If who steals a Perutah, it is as if he takes the soul of his victim - "the way of a thief, he takes the owner's soul";</p>
<p class="bas indent2"><span class="nm">1.</span>It also says "he will eat your harvest and your bread, (it is as if) they will eat your sons and daughters";</p>
<p class="bas indent2"><span class="nm">2.</span>It also says "the Chamas (extortion) of people of Yehudah, who spilled innocent blood in their land"</p>
<p class="bas indent2"><span class="nm">3.</span>It also says "to Sha'ul... that he killed the Giv'onim."</p>
<p class="bas indent1"><span class="nm">(h)</span><span class="cl">Question:</span> Why are all these verses needed?</p>
<p class="bas indent1"><span class="nm">(i)</span><span class="cl">Answer:</span> One might have thought that theft is like killing only the owner, but not his children - "your sons and daughters" teaches that this is not so;</p>
<p class="bas indent2"><span class="nm">1.</span>One might have thought that this applies only to theft without paying, but not to one who pays - "the Chamas of people of Yehudah, who spilled innocent blood " teaches that this is not so;</p>
<p class="bas indent2"><span class="nm">2.</span>One might have thought that this applies only to direct theft, but not by causation - "to Sha'ul... that he killed the Giv'onim" teaches that this is not so.</p>
<p class="bas indent2"><span class="nm">3.</span><span class="cl">Question:</span> Where do we find that Sha'ul killed the Giv'onim?</p>
<p class="bas indent2"><span class="nm">4.</span><span class="cl">Answer:</span> He did not directly kill them. He killed the Kohanim of Nov, and they used to supply them with water and food. (Rashi Yevamos 78b - the Kohanim used to supply the Giv'onim. Maharsha - the Giv'onim supplied the Kohanim, and they were blessed for doing so.)</p>
<p class="bas indent3"><span class="nm">i.</span>The verse considers this like killing them.</p>
<p class="bas subject"><span class="nm">3)</span>BUYING FROM WOMEN</p>
<p class="bas indent1"><span class="nm">(a)</span><span class="cl">(Mishnah):</span> We may buy from women...</p>
<p class="bas indent1"><span class="nm">(b)</span><span class="cl">(Beraisa):</span> We may buy woolen garments in Yehudah and linen garments in Galil from women;</p>
<p class="bas indent1"><span class="nm">(c)</span>We may not buy wine, oil and flour from them, nor from slaves or children;</p>
<p class="bas indent1"><span class="nm">(d)</span>R. Elazar bar Shimon says, a woman may sell the value of four or five Dinarim, in order to make a covering for her head.</p>
<p class="bas indent1"><span class="nm">(e)</span>If the seller says to conceal it, it is always forbidden.</p>
<p class="bas indent1"><span class="nm">(f)</span>Collectors of Tzedakah may take only a small amount from women.</p>
<p class="bas indent1"><span class="nm">(g)</span>From wives of olive-pressers, we may buy a large quantity of olives or oil, but not a small amount.</p>
<p class="bas indent1"><span class="nm">(h)</span>R. Shimon ben Gamliel says, in upper Galil we may buy a small amount of olives from women, for often their husbands are embarrassed to sell themselves, and ask their wives to sell.</p>
<p class="bas indent1"><span class="nm">(i)</span>Ravina (who collected Tzedakah) visited Bei Mechuza. Women threw gold chains and bracelets at him. He took them.</p>
<p class="bas indent1"><span class="nm">(j)</span><span class="cl">Rabah Tosfah:</span> The Beraisa permits collectors of Tzedakah to take only a small amount from women!</p>
<p class="bas indent1"><span class="nm">(k)</span><span class="cl">Ravina:</span> For people of Mechuza, this is a small amount.</p>
<p class="bas subject"><span class="nm">4)</span>WHICH THINGS PEOPLE CARE ABOUT</p>
<p class="bas indent1"><span class="nm">(a)</span><span class="cl">(Mishnah):</span> Launderers may keep tufts that they remove from clothing;</p>
<p class="bas indent2"><span class="nm">1.</span>What a fuller (one who cleans and shrinks wool) removes, he must return it to the owner (of the garment).</p>
<p class="bas indent1"><span class="nm">(b)</span>If a launderer removes three threads to even out a garment, he may keep them;</p>
<p class="bas indent2"><span class="nm">1.</span>If he removes more, he must return them to the owner.</p>
<p class="bas indent2"><span class="nm">2.</span>If there are black threads on a white garment, he may keep as many as there are (for they detract from the garment).</p>
<p class="bas indent1"><span class="nm">(c)</span>If a tailor had enough thread left over to sew with, or cut off a piece of material three fingers by three fingers, the owner gets it;</p>
<p class="bas indent1"><span class="nm">(d)</span>Shavings shaved off by a Ma'atzad (plane) belong to the carpenter. Those from a Keshil (big plane) belong to the owner.</p>
<p class="bas indent2"><span class="nm">1.</span>If he is working in the owner's house, even sawdust from a drill belongs to the owner.</p>
<p class="bas indent1"><span class="nm">(e)</span><span class="cl">(Gemara - Beraisa):</span> We may buy tufts from a launderer, because they belong to him;</p>
<p class="bas indent2"><span class="nm">1.</span>A launderer takes the two top threads;</p>
<p class="bas bbbline">119b----------------------------------------119b</p>
<p class="bas indent2"><span class="nm">2.</span>He should not sew loops (for stretching the garment) with more than three stitches.</p>
<p class="bas indent1"><span class="nm">(f)</span>He should not comb the garment in the direction of the warp threads, rather, in the direction of the woof threads;</p>
<p class="bas indent1"><span class="nm">(g)</span>He should even it out lengthwise, not widthwise;</p>
<p class="bas indent2"><span class="nm">1.</span>He may remove strands up to one Tefach thick to even it out.</p>
<p class="bas indent1"><span class="nm">(h)</span><span class="cl">Contradiction:</span> The Beraisa permits taking two threads, the Mishnah permits three!</p>
<p class="bas indent1"><span class="nm">(i)</span><span class="cl">Answer:</span> The Beraisa discusses strong threads. The Mishnah discusses weak threads.</p>
<p class="bas subject"><span class="nm">5)</span>PROPER FIXING OF GARMENTS</p>
<p class="bas indent1"><span class="nm">(a)</span><span class="cl">(Beraisa):</span> He should not comb the garment in the direction of the warp threads, rather, in the direction of the woof threads.</p>
<p class="bas indent1"><span class="nm">(b)</span><span class="cl">Contradiction:</span> Another Beraisa says just the opposite!</p>
<p class="bas indent1"><span class="nm">(c)</span><span class="cl">Answer:</span> A garment worn every day should not be combed in the direction of the warp threads, lest it tear easily. For a fancy garment, this is better, for it looks nicer.</p>
<p class="bas indent1"><span class="nm">(d)</span><span class="cl">(Beraisa):</span> He should not sew loops with more than three stitches.</p>
<p class="bas indent1"><span class="nm">(e)</span><span class="cl">Question (R. Yirmiyah):</span> Does this mean three insertions of the needle, or three complete (insertion and extraction) stitches?</p>
<p class="bas indent1"><span class="nm">(f)</span>This question is unsettled.</p>
<p class="bas indent1"><span class="nm">(g)</span><span class="cl">(Beraisa):</span> He should even it out lengthwise, not widthwise;</p>
<p class="bas indent1"><span class="nm">(h)</span><span class="cl">Contradiction:</span> Another Beraisa says just the opposite!</p>
<p class="bas indent1"><span class="nm">(i)</span><span class="cl">Answer:</span> A regular garment should be evened out lengthwise. A belt should be evened out widthwise (since only the ends are seen).</p>
<p class="bas subject"><span class="nm">6)</span>WHAT MAY BE BOUGHT</p>
<p class="bas indent1"><span class="nm">(a)</span><span class="cl">(Beraisa):</span> We may not buy tufts from a fuller, for they do not belong to him;</p>
<p class="bas indent2"><span class="nm">1.</span>In a place where the custom is that he keeps them, we may buy.</p>
<p class="bas indent2"><span class="nm">2.</span>Everywhere, we may buy from him a pillow or blanket stuffed with tufts.</p>
<p class="bas indent2"><span class="nm">3.</span><span class="cl">Question:</span> What is the reason?</p>
<p class="bas indent2"><span class="nm">4.</span><span class="cl">Answer:</span> (Even if he stole them,) he acquired them through changing them.</p>
<p class="bas indent1"><span class="nm">(b)</span><span class="cl">(Beraisa):</span> We may not buy the following from a weaver: wool put on the pole holding the woof threads, threads through which the warp threads pass, woof threads, or leftover balls of thread. We may buy a multicolored garment (even though it seems that the material was taken from other garments), and spun or woven threads.</p>
<p class="bas indent1"><span class="nm">(c)</span><span class="cl">Question:</span> Something woven was already spun (it suffices to permit spun threads)!</p>
<p class="bas indent1"><span class="nm">(d)</span><span class="cl">Answer:</span> The Beraisa teaches about plaits, which were not previously spun.</p>
<p class="bas indent1"><span class="nm">(e)</span><span class="cl">(Beraisa):</span> We may not buy from a dyer samples (of garments, taken to see how the dye will be absorbed), examples (of wool of the desired color) or bits pulled from shearings;</p>
<p class="bas indent2"><span class="nm">1.</span>We may buy from him dyed garments, spun thread and garments.</p>
<p class="bas indent1"><span class="nm">(f)</span><span class="cl">Question:</span> A garment was already spun!</p>
<p class="bas indent1"><span class="nm">(g)</span><span class="cl">Answer:</span> The Beraisa teaches about felt, which was not previously spun.</p>
<p class="bas subject"><span class="nm">7)</span>WHAT MAY BE BOUGHT</p>
<p class="bas indent1"><span class="nm">(a)</span><span class="cl">(Beraisa):</span> If one gave skins to a tanner, the pieces of skin and wool that come off belong to the owner;</p>
<p class="bas indent2"><span class="nm">1.</span>What comes off in the water, the tanner keeps.</p>
<p class="bas indent1"><span class="nm">(b)</span><span class="cl">(Mishnah):</span> Black threads...</p>
<p class="bas indent1"><span class="nm">(c)</span><span class="cl">(Rav Yehudah):</span> A launderer is called Katzra. He is Mekatzer (shortens) garments, and keeps what he removes.</p>
<p class="bas indent1"><span class="nm">(d)</span><span class="cl">(Rav Yehudah):</span> If the three threads were not taken, they count towards the thumb's-breadth that the Techeiles strings (of Tzitzis) must be distanced from the corner;</p>
<p class="bas indent2"><span class="nm">1.</span>My son Yitzchak is particular about them (he takes them).</p>
<p class="bas indent1"><span class="nm">(e)</span><span class="cl">(Mishnah):</span> If a tailor had enough thread left over...</p>
<p class="bas indent1"><span class="nm">(f)</span><span class="cl">Question:</span> How much is considered enough to sew with?</p>
<p class="bas indent1"><span class="nm">(g)</span><span class="cl">Answer (Rav Asi):</span> It is a needle's length, and past the needle (one needs a needle's length just to insert the needle).</p>
<p class="bas indent1"><span class="nm">(h)</span><span class="cl">Question:</span> Does he mean a needle's length above the (length of the) needle, or a needle's length, and any amount more?</p>
<p class="bas indent1"><span class="nm">(i)</span><span class="cl">Answer (Beraisa):</span> If a tailor had thread left over insufficient to sew with, or fabric less than three fingers by three fingers, if the owner wants them, he gets them. If not, the tailor keeps them.</p>
<p class="bas indent2"><span class="nm">1.</span>If the Mishnah means two needle's lengths, even less than this can be used for a loop.</p>
<p class="bas indent2"><span class="nm">2.</span>But if the Mishnah means a needle's length and any amount past this, less than this is useless! (Why would anyone want it?)</p>
<p class="bas indent3"><span class="nm">i.</span>We conclude, it means two needle's lengths.</p>
<p class="bas indent1"><span class="nm">(j)</span><span class="cl">(Mishnah):</span> Shavings that come off a Ma'atzad (plane) belong to the carpenter. Those from a Keshil (big plane) to the owner.</p>
<p class="bas indent1"><span class="nm">(k)</span><span class="cl">Contradiction (Beraisa):</span> Pieces that come off a Ma'atzad or saw belong to the owner. Shavings from a drill or plane and sawdust belong to the carpenter.</p>
<p class="bas indent1"><span class="nm">(l)</span><span class="cl">Answer (Rava):</span> In the region of the Tana of the Mishnah, there are two kinds of planes. Big ones are called Keshil, and small ones are called Ma'atzad;</p>
<p class="bas indent2"><span class="nm">1.</span>In the region of the Tana of the Beraisa, they only have big ones, and they call them Ma'atzad.</p>
<p class="bas indent1"><span class="nm">(m)</span><span class="cl">(Mishnah):</span> If he is working in the owner's house...</p>
<p class="bas indent1"><span class="nm">(n)</span><span class="cl">(Beraisa):</span> If one quarries rocks, we may buy from anything from him;</p>
<p class="bas indent1"><span class="nm">(o)</span>Pruners of trees, vines and bushes, weeders, people who uproot some of the vegetables where they are growing too densely, if the owner wants what they remove, they must give him.</p>
<p class="bas indent1"><span class="nm">(p)</span><span class="cl">(Rav Yehudah):</span> One may keep hops and unripe fodder, except in places where people care about them.</p>
<p class="bas indent1"><span class="nm">(q)</span><span class="cl">(Ravina):</span> In Masa Machsiya, people care about them.</p>
