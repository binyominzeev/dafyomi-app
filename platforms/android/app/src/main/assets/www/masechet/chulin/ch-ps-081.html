<div class="indent1"><span class="nm">(a)</span><p><span class="cl">Answer #3 (R. Zeira):</span> One is not lashed for slaughtering Kodshim prematurely, because the Lav was uprooted. It is only an Isur Aseh;</p></div>
<div class="indent2"><span class="nm">1.</span><p>"From the eighth day and onwards it will be acceptable", but not before this.</p></div>
<div class="indent2"><span class="nm">2.</span><p>A Lav derived from a Mitzvas Aseh is considered an Aseh.</p></div>
<div class="indent1"><span class="nm">(b)</span><p><span class="cl">Question:</span> This verse is needed for R. Aftoriki's law!</p></div>
<div class="indent2"><span class="nm">1.</span><p><span class="cl">(R. Aftoriki):</span> "Seven days it will be with its mother" implies that the following night it may be offered!</p></div>
<div class="indent2"><span class="nm">2.</span><p><span class="cl">Contradiction:</span> "From the eighth day and onwards it will be acceptable", but not the night before!</p></div>
<div class="indent2"><span class="nm">3.</span><p><span class="cl">Answer (R. Aftoriki):</span> One may be Mekadesh it on the night of the eighth (or later). It may be offered on the eighth day.</p></div>
<div class="indent1"><span class="nm">(c)</span><p><span class="cl">Answer:</span> "So you will do to your cattle and flock" is extra, so we can learn both laws.</p></div>
<div class="subject"><span class="nm">2)</span><p>OSO V'ES BENO OF KODSHIM</p></div>
<div class="indent1"><span class="nm">(a)</span><p><span class="cl">(Rav Hamnuna):</span> R. Shimon holds that Oso v'Es Beno does not apply to Kodshim.</p></div>
<div class="indent2"><span class="nm">1.</span><p>This is because he holds that Shechitah that does not permit is not considered Shechitah. Shechitah of Kodshim does not (alone or immediately) permit the animal.</p></div>
<div class="indent1"><span class="nm">(b)</span><p><span class="cl">Question (Rava - Beraisa - R. Shimon):</span> If Oso v'Es Beno of Kodshim were slaughtered outside, the second Shochet transgresses a Lav;</p></div>
<div class="indent2"><span class="nm">1.</span><p>R. Shimon holds that if one slaughters any Korban that is now unacceptable, but will become acceptable, he transgresses a Lav. He is not Chayav Kares;</p></div>
<div class="indent2"><span class="nm">2.</span><p>Chachamim say, if he is not Chayav Kares (because it is unacceptable now), he does not transgress a Lav.</p></div>
<div class="indent2"><span class="nm">3.</span><p><span class="cl">(Summation of question):</span> Why does R. Shimon exempt the second Shochet from Kares?</p></div>
<div class="indent3"><span class="nm">i.</span><p>Since the first Shechitah was invalid, it is as if the animal was killed (not slaughtered). The second animal is Kosher for a Korban that same day!</p></div>
<div class="indent1"><span class="nm">(c)</span><p><span class="cl">Answer (Rava):</span> The Beraisa is abbreviated. It means as follows:</p></div>
<div class="indent2"><span class="nm">1.</span><p>If Kodshim were slaughtered outside, Chachamim are Mechayev the first Shochet Kares. The second Korban is Pasul, and the second Shochet is exempt (for Shechutei Chutz);</p></div>
<div class="indent2"><span class="nm">2.</span><p>R. Shimon says, both are Chayav Kares;</p></div>
<div class="indent2"><span class="nm">3.</span><p>If they were slaughtered outside and inside (in this order), Chachamim are Mechayev the first Shochet Kares, and the second Korban is Pasul. The second Shochet is exempt;</p></div>
<div class="indent3"><span class="nm">i.</span><p>R. Shimon is Machshir the second Korban;</p></div>
<div class="indent2"><span class="nm">4.</span><p>If they were slaughtered inside and outside, Chachamim are Machshir the first Korban, disqualify the second Korban, and both Shochtim are exempt;</p></div>
<div class="indent3"><span class="nm">i.</span><p>R. Shimon says, the second Shochet transgresses a Lav.</p></div>
<div class="indent2"><span class="nm">5.</span><p><span class="cl">Objection:</span> If R. Shimon holds that Oso v'Es Beno does not apply to Kodshim, the second Shochet should be Chayav Kares!</p></div>
<div class="indent1"><span class="nm">(d)</span><p><span class="cl">Correction (Rava):</span> Rav Hamnuna meant that R. Shimon holds that one is not lashed for Oso v'Es Beno of Kodshim.</p></div>
<div class="indent2"><span class="nm">1.</span><p>One may not eat a Korban before Zerikah. At the time of Shechitah, it is not known if Zerikah will be done and retroactively validate the Shechitah.</p></div>
<div class="indent2"><span class="nm">2.</span><p>Any Hasra'ah (warning) given to the Shochet is doubtful. (He transgresses only if Zerikah will be done.) Such Hasra'ah is invalid.</p></div>
<div class="indent1"><span class="nm">(e)</span><p><span class="cl">(Rava):</span> If one slaughters Chulin and (then) Shelamim (Oso v'Es Beno), he is exempt. If he slaughtered the Shelamim first, he is liable;</p></div>
<div class="indent1"><span class="nm">(f)</span><p><span class="cl">(Rava):</span> If the mother is Chulin, and the child is an Olah, he is exempt not only if he slaughters the Chulin first, rather, even if he slaughters the Olah first;</p></div>
<div class="bbbline">81b----------------------------------------81b</p></div>
<div class="indent2"><span class="nm">1.</span><p>This is because Shechitah of an Olah does not permit the meat to be eaten. (Therefore, it is not considered Shechitah.)</p></div>
<div class="indent1"><span class="nm">(g)</span><p><span class="cl">(R. Yakov):</span> What is burned on the Mizbe'ach is considered like being eaten (so Shechitah of an Olah is considered Shechitah);</p></div>
<div class="indent2"><span class="nm">1.</span><p>"V'Im He'achol Ye'achel mi'Bsar Zevach Shelamav" discusses two eatings, of people and of the Mizbe'ach.</p></div>
<div class="subject"><span class="nm">3)</span><p>IMPROPER SHECHITOS</p></div>
<div class="indent1"><span class="nm">(a)</span><p><span class="cl">(Mishnah - R. Shimon):</span> One is not liable (for Oso v'Es Beno) in the following cases (since they are not considered Shechitah):</p></div>
<div class="indent2"><span class="nm">1.</span><p>The animal was found to be Terefah;</p></div>
<div class="indent2"><span class="nm">2.</span><p>Shechitah for idolatry;</p></div>
<div class="indent2"><span class="nm">3.</span><p>Shechitah of the Parah Adumah, an animal sentenced to be stoned, or Eglah Arufah (a calf that is beheaded to atone for a murder);</p></div>
<div class="indent1"><span class="nm">(b)</span><p>Chachamim say, all of these are considered Shechitah.</p></div>
<div class="indent1"><span class="nm">(c)</span><p>One is not liable if it was slaughtered improperly (i.e. and became a Nevelah), whether the Pesul was intentional or unintentional.</p></div>
<div class="indent1"><span class="nm">(d)</span><p><span class="cl">(Gemara - Reish Lakish):</span> Regarding idolatry, Chachamim are Mechayev (for Oso v'Es Beno) only if the second animal was slaughtered with proper intention;</p></div>
<div class="indent2"><span class="nm">1.</span><p>If the second animal was slaughtered for idolatry, even if the first was slaughtered properly, since he is liable to death (for the second Shechitah), he is exempt for Oso v'Es Beno.</p></div>
<div class="indent1"><span class="nm">(e)</span><p><span class="cl">R. Yochanan:</span> Even children know that!</p></div>
<div class="indent1"><span class="nm">(f)</span><p><span class="cl">(R. Yochanan):</span> Sometimes, even if the second animal was slaughtered for idolatry, he is liable for Oso v'Es Beno;</p></div>
<div class="indent2"><span class="nm">1.</span><p>The case is, he was warned not to slaughter Oso v'Es Beno, but he was not warned about idolatry.</p></div>
<div class="indent2"><span class="nm">2.</span><p>Reish Lakish holds that since he would be exempt for Oso v'Es Beno had he been warned about idolatry, he is exempt even if he was not warned.</p></div>
<div class="subject"><span class="nm">4)</span><p>DOUBLE LIABILTY</p></div>
<div class="indent1"><span class="nm">(a)</span><p>R. Yochanan and Reish Lakish are consistent with their opinions in a related case.</p></div>
<div class="indent1"><span class="nm">(b)</span><p><span class="cl">(Rav Dimi):</span> If one transgressed (b'Shogeg) an Isur punishable by death or lashes (if done b'Mezid), and simultaneously did something for which one must pay, R. Yochanan obligates him to pay, and Reish Lakish exempts.</p></div>
<div class="indent2"><span class="nm">1.</span><p>R. Yochanan obligates, since he will not be killed or lashed;</p></div>
<div class="indent2"><span class="nm">2.</span><p>Reish Lakish exempts. Since he would be exempt had he sinned (b'Mezid) with Hasra'ah, he is exempt even if he was not warned.</p></div>
<div class="indent1"><span class="nm">(c)</span><p>The argument must be taught in both cases;</p></div>
<div class="indent2"><span class="nm">1.</span><p><span class="cl">Version #1 (Rashi):</span> Had we heard only that Reish Lakish exempts regarding Oso v'Es Beno, one might have thought this is because we do not administer two bodily punishments, but he would not exempt from paying money;</p></div>
<div class="indent2"><span class="nm">2.</span><p>Had we heard only that R. Yochanan obligates money, one might have thought that since we do not administer two bodily punishments, even when one is not killed for idolatry, he is exempt for Oso v'Es Beno.</p></div>
<div class="indent2"><span class="nm">3.</span><p><span class="cl">Version #2 (Tosfos):</span> Had we heard only that Reish Lakish exempts from paying, one might have thought this is learned from a verse, but lashes are given;</p></div>
<div class="indent2"><span class="nm">4.</span><p>Had we heard only that R. Yochanan obligates lashes, one might have thought that he agrees that one is exempt from paying (like Tana d'Vei Chizkiyah learns from a verse).</p></div>
