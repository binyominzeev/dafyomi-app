<div class="subject"><span class="nm">1)</span><p>IS HAIR A YAD OR SHOMER? (cont.)</p></div>
<div class="indent1"><span class="nm">(a)</span><p><span class="cl">Version #2 (Mishnah):</span> The following can join with meat for the Shi'ur for Tum'as Ochlim, but not for Tum'as Nevelah - skin, Rotev, spices...</p></div>
<div class="indent1"><span class="nm">(b)</span><p><span class="cl">(Reish Lakish):</span> This applies only to bones (and skin... ), which are Shomrim, but not hair.</p></div>
<div class="indent1"><span class="nm">(c)</span><p><span class="cl">(R. Yochanan):</span> Even hair is a Shomer.</p></div>
<div class="indent1"><span class="nm">(d)</span><p><span class="cl">Question (Reish Lakish):</span> Can there be a Shomer (hair) for a Shomer (the skin)?</p></div>
<div class="indent1"><span class="nm">(e)</span><p><span class="cl">Answer (R. Yochanan):</span> Hair is rooted in the skin.</p></div>
<div class="indent2"><span class="nm">1.</span><p><span class="cl">Question (Rav Acha bar Yakov):</span> If so, how can we write Tefilin? We require Kesivah Tamah!</p></div>
<div class="indent2"><span class="nm">2.</span><p><span class="cl">Answer:</span> Chachamim of Eretz Yisrael taught that we are not concerned for any hole that the ink passes over.</p></div>
<div class="indent1"><span class="nm">(f)</span><p><span class="cl">Question (R. Yochanan - Mishnah):</span> If skin (of a Nevelah) has k'Zayis of meat on it, one who touches a strand or a hair opposite the meat becomes Tamei.</p></div>
<div class="indent2"><span class="nm">1.</span><p><span class="cl">Suggestion:</span> The hair is Metamei because it is a Shomer.</p></div>
<div class="indent1"><span class="nm">(g)</span><p><span class="cl">Answer:</span> No, it is a Yad.</p></div>
<div class="indent1"><span class="nm">(h)</span><p><span class="cl">Question:</span> One hair cannot serve like a Yad!</p></div>
<div class="indent1"><span class="nm">(i)</span><p><span class="cl">Answer:</span> We can answer like R. Ila'a taught, when there are many strands at the top of a sheaf, each is a Yad, because one can take it by all the strands;</p></div>
<div class="indent2"><span class="nm">1.</span><p>Similarly, when there are many hairs, each is a Yad.</p></div>
<div class="indent1"><span class="nm">(j)</span><p><span class="cl">Question:</span> Where was R. Ila'a's law taught?</p></div>
<div class="indent1"><span class="nm">(k)</span><p><span class="cl">Answer (Mishnah):</span> Strands at the top of sheaves bring Tum'ah and are Metamei, but they do not join for the Shi'ur for Tum'ah.</p></div>
<div class="indent2"><span class="nm">1.</span><p><span class="cl">Question:</span> What can the strands be used for? (Why are they considered Yados?)</p></div>
<div class="indent2"><span class="nm">2.</span><p><span class="cl">Answer (R. Ila'a):</span> The case is, there are many strands at the top of a sheaf.</p></div>
<div class="subject"><span class="nm">2)</span><p>THE ROTEV</p></div>
<div class="indent1"><span class="nm">(a)</span><p><span class="cl">(Mishnah):</span> The Rotev... (joins for Tum'as Ochlim).</p></div>
<div class="indent1"><span class="nm">(b)</span><p><span class="cl">Question:</span> What is Rotev?</p></div>
<div class="indent1"><span class="nm">(c)</span><p><span class="cl">Answer #1 (Rava):</span> It is fat.</p></div>
<div class="indent1"><span class="nm">(d)</span><p><span class="cl">Objection (Abaye):</span> Fat itself has Tum'as Ochlim!</p></div>
<div class="indent1"><span class="nm">(e)</span><p><span class="cl">Answer #2 (Abaye):</span> It is congealed juice of the meat.</p></div>
<div class="indent1"><span class="nm">(f)</span><p><span class="cl">Question:</span> Why must we say that it congealed? Even if did not, it joins for the Shi'ur of Tum'ah!</p></div>
<div class="indent2"><span class="nm">1.</span><p><span class="cl">(Reish Lakish):</span> Brine on vegetables joins to the quantity of a date (to be liable for eating on Yom Kipur).</p></div>
<div class="indent1"><span class="nm">(g)</span><p><span class="cl">Answer:</span> Liability for eating on Yom Kipur depends on what calms the mind of someone fasting. (For this, a liquid on a solid helps like a solid);</p></div>
<div class="indent2"><span class="nm">1.</span><p>For Tum'ah, it joins only if it is congealed.</p></div>
<div class="subject"><span class="nm">3)</span><p>LIQUIDS ARE LIKE SOLIDS</p></div>
<div class="indent1"><span class="nm">(a)</span><p><span class="cl">(Mishnah):</span> And Kipah...</p></div>
<div class="indent1"><span class="nm">(b)</span><p><span class="cl">Question:</span> What is Kipah?</p></div>
<div class="indent1"><span class="nm">(c)</span><p><span class="cl">Answer #1 (Rava):</span> It is dregs of meat.</p></div>
<div class="indent1"><span class="nm">(d)</span><p><span class="cl">Objection (Abaye):</span> Dregs themselves have Tum'as Ochlim!</p></div>
<div class="indent1"><span class="nm">(e)</span><p><span class="cl">Answer #2 (Rav Papa):</span> It is spices (cooked with the meat).</p></div>
<div class="indent1"><span class="nm">(f)</span><p><span class="cl">(Mishnah):</span> If one cooked blood until it hardened, and ate it, or if one melted Chelev and drank it, he is liable.</p></div>
<div class="indent1"><span class="nm">(g)</span><p><span class="cl">Question:</span> Granted, one who hardens blood shows that he considers it important, therefore he is liable for it;</p></div>
<div class="indent2"><span class="nm">1.</span><p>However, why is he liable for drinking melted Chelev? The Torah said not to eat Chelev. Drinking is not eating!</p></div>
<div class="indent1"><span class="nm">(h)</span><p><span class="cl">Answer (Reish Lakish):</span> "A soul (that will eat Chelev)" includes one who drinks (for also this satisfies the soul).</p></div>
<div class="indent1"><span class="nm">(i)</span><p><span class="cl">(Beraisa):</span> If one melted Chametz and drank it he is Chayav Kares. If one dissolved Matzah and drank it, he did not fulfill the Mitzvah.</p></div>
<div class="indent1"><span class="nm">(j)</span><p><span class="cl">Question:</span> Granted, he did not fulfill the Mitzvah of Matzah, for this is not "bread of poverty" that we are commanded to eat;</p></div>
<div class="indent2"><span class="nm">1.</span><p>However, why is he Chayav Kares for drinking melted Chametz? The Torah said not to eat it!</p></div>
<div class="indent1"><span class="nm">(k)</span><p><span class="cl">Answer (Reish Lakish):</span> "A soul (that will eat Chametz)" includes one who drinks.</p></div>
<div class="indent1"><span class="nm">(l)</span><p><span class="cl">(Beraisa):</span> If one melted Nivlas Ohf Tahor (the Nevelah of a Tahor bird) using fire, one who drinks it becomes Tamei;</p></div>
<div class="indent2"><span class="nm">1.</span><p>If he melted it in the sun, one who drinks it does not became Tamei.</p></div>
<div class="indent1"><span class="nm">(m)</span><p><span class="cl">Question:</span> In the Reisha, why does he become Tamei for drinking it? The Torah discusses one who eats it!</p></div>
<div class="indent1"><span class="nm">(n)</span><p><span class="cl">Answer (Reish Lakish):</span> "A soul (who will eat the Nevelah of a Tahor bird)" includes one who drinks.</p></div>
<div class="indent1"><span class="nm">(o)</span><p><span class="cl">Question:</span> If so, even if he melted it in the sun, he should become Tamei if he drinks it!</p></div>
<div class="indent1"><span class="nm">(p)</span><p><span class="cl">Answer:</span> It spoils before it melts.</p></div>
<div class="subject"><span class="nm">4)</span><p>WHY ALL THE VERSES ARE NECESSARY</p></div>
<div class="indent1"><span class="nm">(a)</span><p>The Torah had to teach all three cases;</p></div>
<div class="indent2"><span class="nm">1.</span><p>Had it taught only about Chelev, we could not learn to Chametz, for (Chelev is more stringent). It was never permitted;</p></div>
<div class="indent3"><span class="nm">i.</span><p>Also, we could not learn to Nevelah, for one who eats Chelev is Chayav Kares;</p></div>
<div class="indent2"><span class="nm">2.</span><p>Had it taught only about Chametz, we could not learn to Chelev, for (Chametz is more stringent because) it is never wholly permitted (like Chelev is, like we will explain);</p></div>
<div class="indent3"><span class="nm">i.</span><p>Also, we could not learn to Nevelah, for one who eats Chametz is Chayav Kares;</p></div>
<div class="indent2"><span class="nm">3.</span><p>Had it taught only about Nevelah, we could not learn to Chametz or Chelev, for Nevelah is more stringent. It is Metamei.</p></div>
<div class="indent1"><span class="nm">(b)</span><p><span class="cl">Suggestion:</span> Perhaps we can learn one of them from the other two!</p></div>
<div class="indent1"><span class="nm">(c)</span><p><span class="cl">Question:</span> Which could we learn?</p></div>
<div class="indent2"><span class="nm">1.</span><p>We cannot learn Nevelah from the others (they are more stringent). One who eats Chelev or Chametz is Chayav Kares!</p></div>
<div class="indent2"><span class="nm">2.</span><p>We cannot learn Chametz from the others. They were never permitted!</p></div>
<div class="indent2"><span class="nm">3.</span><p>We cannot learn Chelev from the others. They are never wholly permitted!</p></div>
<div class="indent2"><span class="nm">4.</span><p><span class="cl">Question:</span> Where do we find that Chelev is wholly permitted?</p></div>
<div class="indent3"><span class="nm">i.</span><p><span class="cl">Suggestion:</span> Chelev of Behemos is offered on the Mizbe'ach.</p></div>
<div class="indent3"><span class="nm">ii.</span><p><span class="cl">Rejection:</span> We offer also Nevelah on the Mizbe'ach, i.e. birds killed through Melikah!</p></div>
<div class="indent2"><span class="nm">5.</span><p><span class="cl">Answer:</span> Rather, Chelev of Chayos is permitted to people.</p></div>
<div class="indent2"><span class="nm">6.</span><p><span class="cl">Question:</span> Also Nevelah is wholly permitted. Kohanim eat Chatas ha'Of!</p></div>
<div class="indent2"><span class="nm">7.</span><p><span class="cl">Answer:</span> Chelev of Chayos is permitted to all people;</p></div>
<div class="indent3"><span class="nm">i.</span><p>Chatas ha'Of is Kodesh. Hash-m allows Kohanim to eat it, even though it is Nevelah. We never find that Nevelah is permitted to commoners.</p></div>
<div class="indent1"><span class="nm">(d)</span><p><span class="cl">(Beraisa):</span> "Ha'Teme'im (Sheratzim)" - the extra 'Hei' forbids their brine, Rotev and Kipah.</p></div>
<div class="indent1"><span class="nm">(e)</span><p><span class="cl">Question:</span> Why do we need a verse? We should learn from these three (Chelev, Chametz and Nevelah)!</p></div>
<div class="indent1"><span class="nm">(f)</span><p><span class="cl">Answer:</span> The verse is needed. One is liable for any of the three only if he ate a k'Zayis. We cannot learn from them to obligate for less than a k'Zayis. (One is liable for k'Adashah (the volume of a lentil) of Sheratzim. "Ha'Teme'im" obligates for k'Adashah of their brine, Rotev and Kipah.)</p></div>
<div class="bbbline">120b----------------------------------------120b</p></div>
<div class="indent1"><span class="nm">(g)</span><p><span class="cl">Question:</span> Why can't we learn the three from Sheratzim?</p></div>
<div class="indent1"><span class="nm">(h)</span><p><span class="cl">Answer:</span> Sheratzim are more stringent. A tiny amount (k'Adashah) of them is Metamei (and obligates one who eats it).</p></div>
<div class="indent1"><span class="nm">(i)</span><p><span class="cl">(Beraisa):</span> Regarding the following Isurim, liquids that come from a solid are like the solid:</p></div>
<div class="indent2"><span class="nm">1.</span><p>Tevel (untithed produce), Chodosh (grain planted after Pesach. It is forbidden until the day the Omer is brought, i.e. the second day of the coming Pesach), Hekdesh, Shemitah, and Kil'ayim.</p></div>
<div class="indent1"><span class="nm">(j)</span><p><span class="cl">Question:</span> What is the source of this?</p></div>
<div class="indent1"><span class="nm">(k)</span><p><span class="cl">Answer #1:</span> We learn from the above four Isurim.</p></div>
<div class="indent1"><span class="nm">(l)</span><p><span class="cl">Question:</span> In the four Isurim, the Isurim come automatically. Indeed, we can learn to other such Isurim;</p></div>
<div class="indent2"><span class="nm">1.</span><p>However, how can we learn about Isurim that do not come automatically (Rashi - Hekdesh; Tosfos - Kil'ayim)?</p></div>
<div class="indent1"><span class="nm">(m)</span><p><span class="cl">Answer #2:</span> We learn them from Bikurim;</p></div>
<div class="indent2"><span class="nm">1.</span><p><span class="cl">Question:</span> What is the source that liquids of Bikurim are like solids?</p></div>
<div class="indent2"><span class="nm">2.</span><p><span class="cl">Answer (Beraisa - R. Yosi):</span> We bring "fruit" for Bikurim, and not liquids.</p></div>
<div class="indent2"><span class="nm">3.</span><p><span class="cl">Question:</span> What is the source that if grapes were brought and they were made into wine, that the wine is considered Bikurim?</p></div>
<div class="indent2"><span class="nm">4.</span><p><span class="cl">Answer:</span> "You will bring" is extra to include this.</p></div>
<div class="indent1"><span class="nm">(n)</span><p><span class="cl">Objection:</span> We cannot learn from Bikurim, for they require Kri'ah and Hanachah (reciting verses and placing them on the ground)!</p></div>
<div class="indent1"><span class="nm">(o)</span><p><span class="cl">Answer #3:</span> We learn from Terumah;</p></div>
<div class="indent2"><span class="nm">1.</span><p><span class="cl">Question:</span> What is the source that liquids of Terumah are like solids?</p></div>
<div class="indent2"><span class="nm">2.</span><p><span class="cl">Answer:</span> The Torah equates Terumah to Bikurim;</p></div>
<div class="indent3"><span class="nm">i.</span><p>"Terumas Yadecha" refers to Bikurim.</p></div>
<div class="indent1"><span class="nm">(p)</span><p><span class="cl">Objection:</span> We cannot learn from Terumah, for it has stringencies of Misah b'Yedei Shamayim (for a Zar who eats it is b'Mezid), and (if he ate b'Shogeg) adding a fifth (when paying for what he ate)!</p></div>
<div class="indent1"><span class="nm">(q)</span><p><span class="cl">Answer #4:</span> We learn from (a Tzad ha'Shavah of) Terumah and Bikurim.</p></div>
<div class="indent1"><span class="nm">(r)</span><p><span class="cl">Objection:</span> These stringencies apply to both Terumah and Bikurim!</p></div>
<div class="indent1"><span class="nm">(s)</span><p><span class="cl">Answer #5:</span> We learn from Terumah (or Bikurim) and one of the above (Rashi - Chametz or Nevelah; Tosfos - Nevelah or Sheratzim).</p></div>
<div class="subject"><span class="nm">5)</span><p>LIQUIDS OF TERUMAH</p></div>
<div class="indent1"><span class="nm">(a)</span><p><span class="cl">(Mishnah - R. Eliezer):</span> If Terumah fruit was used to make date honey, apple wine, vinegar (from grapes that never ripen), or other fruit juice:</p></div>
<div class="indent2"><span class="nm">1.</span><p>If a Zar drinks it b'Shogeg, he gives Chulin to the Kohen (and it becomes Terumah). He gives as much as he ate plus an added fifth.</p></div>
<div class="indent1"><span class="nm">(b)</span><p>R. Yehoshua exempts (from the added fifth. If the Zar did not own the juice, he pays its value).</p></div>
<div class="indent1"><span class="nm">(c)</span><p><span class="cl">Question:</span> What do they argue about?</p></div>
<div class="indent1"><span class="nm">(d)</span><p><span class="cl">Answer:</span> They argue about whether we say Dun Minah u'Minah (when we learn from a source, we learn all laws from the source) or Dun Minah v'Uki b'Asrah (we learn only the basic law. Other laws are according to the matter we learn);</p></div>
<div class="indent2"><span class="nm">1.</span><p>R. Eliezer holds that Dun Minah u'Minah:</p></div>
<div class="indent3"><span class="nm">i.</span><p>Regarding Bikurim, liquids of the seven special species of Eretz Yisrael are like the solid. Similarly, liquids of Terumah (which are mid'Rabanan, except for wine and oil) are like the solid.</p></div>
<div class="indent2"><span class="nm">2.</span><p>R. Yehoshua holds that Dun Minah v'Uki b'Asrah;</p></div>
<div class="indent3"><span class="nm">i.</span><p>Regarding Terumah of grapes and olives, which is mid'Oraisa, the liquid is like the solid. We do not apply this to juice of other fruits, for Terumah of other fruits is only mid'Rabanan.</p></div>
<div class="indent1"><span class="nm">(e)</span><p><span class="cl">(Mishnah):</span> The only liquids we may bring for Bikurim are wine and olive oil.</p></div>
<div class="indent2"><span class="nm">1.</span><p>This is like R. Yehoshua, who holds Dun Minah v'Uki b'Asrah;</p></div>
<div class="indent2"><span class="nm">2.</span><p>He learns Bikurim from Terumah.</p></div>
<div class="indent1"><span class="nm">(f)</span><p><span class="cl">(Mishnah):</span> The only liquids of Orlah for which one (who eats them) is lashed are wine and olive oil.</p></div>
<div class="indent2"><span class="nm">1.</span><p>This is like R. Yehoshua, who holds Dun Minah v'Uki b'Asrah;</p></div>
<div class="indent2"><span class="nm">2.</span><p>He learns Bikurim from Terumah. He learns Orlah from Bikurim from a Gezeirah Shavah "Pri-Pri."</p></div>
