<div class="subject"><span class="nm">1)</span><p>WHOM DOES THE HALACHAH FOLLOW?</p></div>
<div class="indent1"><span class="nm">(a)</span><p><span class="cl">(Shmuel):</span> The Halachah follows Chananyah.</p></div>
<div class="indent1"><span class="nm">(b)</span><p>This is consistent with another teaching of Shmuel;</p></div>
<div class="indent2"><span class="nm">1.</span><p><span class="cl">(Mishnah - R. Yehudah):</span> One may mate offspring of a female horse, or make them work together, even if the fathers were donkeys;</p></div>
<div class="indent2"><span class="nm">2.</span><p>A mule born from a (female) horse is forbidden with one born from a (female) donkey.</p></div>
<div class="indent2"><span class="nm">3.</span><p><span class="cl">(Shmuel):</span> This is R. Yehudah's opinion. He holds that we are not concerned for the seed of the father. Chachamim say that all mules are one species (and are permitted with each other.)</p></div>
<div class="indent2"><span class="nm">4.</span><p><span class="cl">Question:</span> Who are the Chachamim he refers to?</p></div>
<div class="indent2"><span class="nm">5.</span><p><span class="cl">Answer:</span> He refers to Chananyah, who says that we are concerned for the seed of the father;</p></div>
<div class="indent3"><span class="nm">i.</span><p>Every mule is a half-donkey, half-horse.</p></div>
<div class="subject"><span class="nm">2)</span><p>THE OPINION OF R. YEHUDAH</p></div>
<div class="indent1"><span class="nm">(a)</span><p><span class="cl">Question:</span> Is R. Yehudah certain that we are not concerned for the seed of the father, or is he in doubt?</p></div>
<div class="indent2"><span class="nm">1.</span><p>If he is certain, even a hybrid child is the same species as its mother, and it is permitted with its mother's species;</p></div>
<div class="indent2"><span class="nm">2.</span><p>If he is in doubt, a hybrid child is forbidden with its mother's species.</p></div>
<div class="indent1"><span class="nm">(b)</span><p><span class="cl">Answer #1 (Mishnah - R. Yehudah):</span> One may mate offspring of a female horse, or make them work together, even if the fathers were donkeys.</p></div>
<div class="indent2"><span class="nm">1.</span><p><span class="cl">Question:</span> What is the case?</p></div>
<div class="indent3"><span class="nm">i.</span><p>If the fathers of both offspring were donkeys, there is no need to teach that they are permitted together!</p></div>
<div class="indent2"><span class="nm">2.</span><p><span class="cl">Answer:</span> Rather, a mule from a female horse is permitted with the child of two horses. This shows that R. Yehudah is certain.</p></div>
<div class="indent1"><span class="nm">(c)</span><p><span class="cl">Rejection:</span> Really, the fathers of both offspring were donkeys;</p></div>
<div class="indent2"><span class="nm">1.</span><p>One might have thought that they are forbidden together, because we consider the donkey side of each animal to work or mate with the horse side of the other. He teaches that this is not so.</p></div>
<div class="indent1"><span class="nm">(d)</span><p><span class="cl">Answer #2 (Beraisa - R. Yehudah):</span> If a mule desires to mate, we may not mate it with a horse or donkey, only with its own kind.</p></div>
<div class="indent2"><span class="nm">1.</span><p>If R. Yehudah was certain, he should permit mating it with its mother's species!</p></div>
<div class="indent2"><span class="nm">2.</span><p><span class="cl">Rejection:</span> The case is, we do not know what its mother was.</p></div>
<div class="indent2"><span class="nm">3.</span><p><span class="cl">Question:</span> The Beraisa says that we may mate it only with its own kind. This implies that we know what its mother was!</p></div>
<div class="indent2"><span class="nm">4.</span><p><span class="cl">Answer:</span> The Beraisa means that because we do not know what its mother was, we may not mate it with a horse nor with a donkey, since it may be mated only with its own kind.</p></div>
<div class="indent2"><span class="nm">5.</span><p><span class="cl">Objection:</span> There are signs to tell what a mule's mother was!</p></div>
<div class="indent3"><span class="nm">i.</span><p><span class="cl">(Abaye):</span> If it has a thick voice, its mother was a horse. If not, it was born to a donkey.</p></div>
<div class="indent3"><span class="nm">ii.</span><p><span class="cl">(Rav Papa):</span> A mule from a (female) donkey has big ears and a small tail. A mule born from a horse is vice-versa.</p></div>
<div class="indent2"><span class="nm">6.</span><p><span class="cl">Answer:</span> The case is, the mule lost its ears and tail, and it is mute. (We cannot determine what the mother was.)</p></div>
<div class="indent1"><span class="nm">(e)</span><p><span class="cl">Answer #3 (Rav Huna brei d'Rav Yehoshua):</span> All agree that a mule is forbidden with its mother.</p></div>
<div class="indent2"><span class="nm">1.</span><p>This shows that R. Yehudah was in doubt.</p></div>
<div class="indent1"><span class="nm">(f)</span><p>R. Aba told his servant 'if you lead my wagon with mules, check that they have the same mother.'</p></div>
<div class="indent1"><span class="nm">(g)</span><p><span class="cl">Inference:</span> He holds that we are not concerned for the seed of the father; and that we may rely on the signs given.</p></div>

<div class="subject"><span class="nm">3)</span><p>OSO V'ES BENO WHEN SLAUGHTERING KIL'AYIM</p></div>
<div class="indent1"><span class="nm">(a)</span><p>(A Koy is a Kosher animal, it is not known whether it is a Chayah or Behemah. Our Sugya discusses Koyim born from a goat and deer.)</p></div>
<div class="indent1"><span class="nm">(b)</span><p><span class="cl">(Beraisa):</span> Oso v'Es Beno applies to Kil'ayim and to a Koy;</p></div>
<div class="indent1"><span class="nm">(c)</span><p>R. Eliezer says, it applies to Kil'ayim born from a goat and sheep, but not to a Koy.</p></div>
<div class="indent1"><span class="nm">(d)</span><p><span class="cl">(Rav Chisda):</span> They refer to a Koy born from a male goat and a female deer.</p></div>
<div class="indent1"><span class="nm">(e)</span><p><span class="cl">Question:</span> What is the case?</p></div>
<div class="indent2"><span class="nm">1.</span><p><span class="cl">Suggestion:</span> Such a Koy had a child, and one slaughtered the Koy and its child on the same day.</p></div>
<div class="indent2"><span class="nm">2.</span><p><span class="cl">Rejection:</span> Rav Chisda said that in such a case, all agree that he is exempt!</p></div>
<div class="indent3"><span class="nm">i.</span><p>The Torah forbids a Seh and its child, but not a deer and its child.</p></div>
<div class="indent1"><span class="nm">(f)</span><p><span class="cl">Answer #1:</span> Rather, a Koy from a male deer and a female goat had a child. The Koy and its child were slaughtered on the same day.</p></div>
<div class="indent1"><span class="nm">(g)</span><p><span class="cl">Rejection:</span> Rav Chisda said that in such a case all agree that he is liable!</p></div>
<div class="indent2"><span class="nm">1.</span><p>The Torah forbids a Seh and its child, no matter what the child is!</p></div>
<div class="indent1"><span class="nm">(h)</span><p><span class="cl">Answer #2:</span> Really, a male goat and a female deer had a daughter, and the daughter had a son. The daughter and her son were slaughtered on the same day.</p></div>
<div class="indent2"><span class="nm">1.</span><p>Chachamim are Mechayev. We are concerned for the seed of the father. The Torah forbids a Seh and its son, even a partial Seh;</p></div>
<div class="indent2"><span class="nm">2.</span><p>R. Eliezer exempts. We are not concerned for the seed of the father, so the Koy is not even a partial Seh.</p></div>
<div class="indent1"><span class="nm">(i)</span><p><span class="cl">Question:</span> Why don't they (directly) argue in the case of Chananyah and Chachamim, whether or not we are concerned for the seed of the father?</p></div>
<div class="indent1"><span class="nm">(j)</span><p><span class="cl">Answer:</span> If so, one might have thought that Chachamim would exempt in our case. We would not know that the Torah forbids even a partial Seh.</p></div>
<div class="indent1"><span class="nm">(k)</span><p>(The following question is based on the final understanding of a Mishnah.)</p></div>
<div class="indent1"><span class="nm">(l)</span><p><span class="cl">Question (Mishnah):</span> One may not slaughter a Koy on Yom Tov. (Perhaps it is a Chayah, and Kisuy (covering the blood) must be done. However, one may not do this on Yom Tov, for perhaps it is a Behemah, and there is no Mitzvah of Kisuy);</p></div>
<div class="indent2"><span class="nm">1.</span><p>If it was slaughtered, he may not do Kisuy.</p></div>
<div class="indent2"><span class="nm">2.</span><p><span class="cl">Question:</span> What is the case?</p></div>
<div class="indent3"><span class="nm">i.</span><p><span class="cl">Suggestion:</span> The Koy was born from a male goat and a female deer.</p></div>
<div class="indent3"><span class="nm">ii.</span><p><span class="cl">Rejection:</span> If so, all would permit to slaughter it and do Kisuy on Yom Tov. Kisuy applies even to a partial deer (Chayah)!</p></div>
<div class="indent2"><span class="nm">3.</span><p><span class="cl">Answer #1:</span> Rather, it is the child of a female goat and a male deer.</p></div>
<div class="indent2"><span class="nm">4.</span><p><span class="cl">Rejection:</span> If so, all would permit slaughtering it!</p></div>
<div class="indent3"><span class="nm">i.</span><p>Chachamim hold that the blood must surely be covered. R. Eliezer holds that it is surely exempt!</p></div>
<div class="indent2"><span class="nm">5.</span><p><span class="cl">Defense:</span> Really, it is the child of a female goat and a male deer; Chachamim are unsure whether we are concerned for the seed of the father.</p></div>
<div class="indent2"><span class="nm">6.</span><p><span class="cl">Inference:</span> If so, R. Eliezer (who argues) must be certain that we are not concerned for the seed of the father!</p></div>
<div class="indent2"><span class="nm">7.</span><p><span class="cl">(Development of question - Beraisa):</span> Matanos (the foreleg, jaw and stomach) of a Koy or (other) hybrids must be given to a Kohen;</p></div>
<div class="indent2"><span class="nm">8.</span><p>R. Eliezer says, Matanos must be given from a crossbreed of a goat and sheep, but not from a Koy.</p></div>
<div class="indent2"><span class="nm">9.</span><p><span class="cl">Question:</span> What is the case?</p></div>
<div class="indent2"><span class="nm">10.</span><p><span class="cl">Answer #1:</span> The Koy is from a male goat and a female deer;</p></div>
<div class="indent3"><span class="nm">i.</span><p>R. Eliezer exempts from Matanos, for they do not apply to a partial Seh.</p></div>
<div class="indent2"><span class="nm">11.</span><p><span class="cl">Rejection:</span> Why would Chachamim obligate?</p></div>
<div class="indent3"><span class="nm">i.</span><p>Surely, they do not obligate full Matanos (it is at most a half-Seh);</p></div>
<div class="indent3"><span class="nm">ii.</span><p>He should be exempt even from half Matanos, for the Kohen cannot prove that we are concerned for the seed of the father! (Chachamim themselves are unsure!)</p></div>
<div class="indent2"><span class="nm">12.</span><p><span class="cl">Answer #2:</span> The Koy is from a female goat and a male deer.</p></div>
<div class="indent2"><span class="nm">13.</span><p>We understand why Chachamim obligate half Matanos. (It is at least a half-Seh.)</p></div>
<div class="indent2"><span class="nm">14.</span><p><span class="cl">Summation of question (l):</span> However, R. Eliezer should obligate full Matanos!</p></div>

<div class="indent1"><span class="nm">(n)</span><p><span class="cl">Question:</span> If so, what do they argue about?</p></div>
<div class="indent1"><span class="nm">(o)</span><p><span class="cl">Answer:</span> They argue about whether a partial Seh is called a Seh. Chachamim say that it is, and R. Eliezer says that it is not.</p></div>
