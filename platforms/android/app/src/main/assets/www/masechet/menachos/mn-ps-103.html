<div class="subject"><span class="nm">1)</span><p>A VOW TO BRING AN INVALID MINCHAH</p></div>
<div class="indent1"><span class="nm">(a)</span><p><span class="cl">(Mishnah):</span> If one said 'Alai to bring a Minchah of barley', he must bring a Minchah of wheat. If he vowed to bring (a Minchah) of (regular) flour, or without oil or Levonah, he must bring it of Soles, with oil and Levonah.</p></div>
<div class="indent1"><span class="nm">(b)</span><p>If he vowed to bring half an Isaron, he must bring a full Isaron;</p></div>
<div class="indent1"><span class="nm">(c)</span><p>If he vowed to bring an Isaron and a half, he must bring two Esronim;</p></div>
<div class="indent1"><span class="nm">(d)</span><p>R. Shimon exempts, for he did not vow the way people vow.</p></div>
<div class="indent1"><span class="nm">(e)</span><p><span class="cl">(Gemara) Question:</span> Why is he obligated? Granted, 'Alai Minchah' obligates him, but 'of barley' is a retraction!</p></div>
<div class="indent1"><span class="nm">(f)</span><p><span class="cl">Answer #1 (Chizkiyah):</span> The Beraisa is like Beis Shamai, who say Tefos Lashon Rishon (we follow the first thing said; they also hold that one cannot permit vows of Hekdesh);</p></div>
<div class="indent2"><span class="nm">1.</span><p><span class="cl">(Mishnah - Beis Shamai):</span> If one said 'I am a Nazir from figs and dates', he is a Nazir;</p></div>
<div class="indent2"><span class="nm">2.</span><p>Beis Hillel say, he is not a Nazir. (Most Meforshim hold that he may eat figs and dates; Rambam forbids.)</p></div>
<div class="indent1"><span class="nm">(g)</span><p><span class="cl">Answer #2 (R. Yochanan):</span> It is even like Beis Hillel. The case is, he says 'had I known that one cannot bring Minchas Nedavah of barley, I would have vowed properly (to bring it from wheat).'</p></div>
<div class="indent1"><span class="nm">(h)</span><p><span class="cl">(Chizkiyah):</span> He is obligated (to bring wheat) only if he vowed to bring a Minchah of barley, but if he vowed to bring a Minchah of lentils, he is exempt.</p></div>
<div class="indent1"><span class="nm">(i)</span><p><span class="cl">Question:</span> Chizkiyah establishes the Mishnah like Beis Shamai, who say Tefos Lashon Rishon (i.e. 'Minchah'.) It should not matter if he tried to retract by saying 'barley' or 'lentils'!</p></div>
<div class="indent1"><span class="nm">(j)</span><p><span class="cl">Answer:</span> Chizkiyah retracted. (Also he establishes it like Beis Hillel.)</p></div>
<div class="indent1"><span class="nm">(k)</span><p><span class="cl">Question:</span> Why did he retract?</p></div>
<div class="indent1"><span class="nm">(l)</span><p><span class="cl">Answer (Rava):</span> The Mishnah was difficult. Why does it say that he vowed to bring a Minchah of barley? It should say that he vowed to bring a Minchah of lentils!</p></div>
<div class="indent2"><span class="nm">1.</span><p>Rather, it says barley, because it is possible to err about this (Minchas Kena'os and the Omer are of barley), but no one would think that a Minchah can be of lentils. (This is like R. Yochanan. The man erred. Had he known that one cannot bring Nedavah of barley, he would have vowed properly.)</p></div>
<div class="indent1"><span class="nm">(m)</span><p><span class="cl">(R. Yochanan):</span> He is obligated even if he vowed to bring a Minchah of lentils.</p></div>
<div class="indent1"><span class="nm">(n)</span><p><span class="cl">Question:</span> R. Yochanan establishes the Mishnah like Beis Hillel. The man did not know that one cannot bring Nedavah of barley. Surely, he knows that one cannot bring a Nedavah of lentils!</p></div>
<div class="indent1"><span class="nm">(o)</span><p><span class="cl">Answer:</span> R. Yochanan addresses Chizkiyah:</p></div>
<div class="indent2"><span class="nm">1.</span><p>He says, you need not retract because it says barley, and not lentils. Perhaps the Mishnah teaches a bigger Chidush!</p></div>
<div class="indent2"><span class="nm">2.</span><p>If he vowed to bring a Minchah of lentils, surely he did not err (he merely seeks to retract). He is obligated (to bring wheat);</p></div>
<div class="indent2"><span class="nm">3.</span><p>Further, even if he vowed to bring barley, one might have thought (like R. Yochanan explains) that he erred, and he is liable only if he says that had he known, he would have vowed to bring wheat. The Mishnah teaches that this is not so. Rather, Tefos Lashon Rishon. (He is obligated in either case.)</p></div>

<div class="indent1"><span class="nm">(a)</span><p><span class="cl">Version #1 (Ze'iri):</span> He is obligated only if he said 'Minchah of Se'orim (barley)'. If he said 'Minchas Se'orim', he is exempt, for we cannot say Tefos Lashon Rishon. ('Minchas' is a construct form. It does not stand on its own.)</p></div>

<div class="indent2"><span class="nm">1.</span><p>'Minchah (of an Isaron)', obligates him to bring one Isaron. We should ignore his last words 'and a half' (since 'Minchah' does not refer to them)!</p></div>
<div class="indent1"><span class="nm">(j)</span><p><span class="cl">Answer:</span> The case is, he vowed to bring (a Minchah of half an Isaron and an Isaron);</p></div>

<div class="subject"><span class="nm">3)</span><p>THE LARGEST POSSIBLE MINCHAH</p></div>
<div class="indent1"><span class="nm">(a)</span><p><span class="cl">(Mishnah):</span> One may bring Minchas Nedavah of 60 Esronim in one Kli;</p></div>
<div class="indent1"><span class="nm">(b)</span><p>If he vowed to bring 61 Esronim, he brings 60 in one Kli and one in another Kli, for the most Soles the Tzibur brings on any day is 61 Esronim. This is when the first day of Sukos falls on Shabbos. (We bring 39 Esronim for Nesachim for 13 bulls, four Esronim for two rams, and 18 for 18 lambs);</p></div>
<div class="indent2"><span class="nm">1.</span><p>It is proper for an individual to bring (in one Kli, at most) one less than the Tzibur.</p></div>
<div class="indent1"><span class="nm">(c)</span><p><span class="cl">R. Shimon:</span> The Nesachim of different consistencies (e.g. Niskei Kevasim have less oil per Isaron than other Nesachim) cannot be mixed together! (Even b'Di'eved, one cannot say that the Tzibur brings 61 in one Kli.)</p></div>
<div class="indent2"><span class="nm">1.</span><p>Rather, one may not bring 61 Esronim in one Kli because they cannot be mixed with the oil. (According to R. Eliezer ben Yakov, only one Log of oil is put into the Kli. According to Chachamim, there is a Log for each Isaron, but 61 is too much to be mixed in the Kli.)</p></div>
<div class="indent1"><span class="nm">(d)</span><p><span class="cl">Chachamim:</span> It is unreasonable to say that 60 can be mixed, but 61 cannot be mixed!</p></div>
<div class="indent1"><span class="nm">(e)</span><p><span class="cl">R. Shimon:</span> All Shi'urim that Chachamim fixed are like this!</p></div>
<div class="indent2"><span class="nm">1.</span><p>(We expound that a Mikveh must contain enough water to envelop an (average) person's entire body. Chachamim said that this is the volume of a box one by one by three Amos tall, i.e. 40 Sa'im.) We say that one can immerse in 40 Sa'im, but not in a drop less than 40 Sa'im!</p></div>
<div class="indent1"><span class="nm">(f)</span><p><span class="cl">(Gemara) Question:</span> What is the source that if one vowed to bring 61 Esronim, he brings 60 in one Kli and one in another Kli?</p></div>
<div class="indent1"><span class="nm">(g)</span><p><span class="cl">Answer #1 (R. Yehudah):</span> The most the Tzibur brings on any day is 61 Esronim, when the first day of Sukos is on Shabbos. It is proper for an individual to bring (at most) one less than the Tzibur.</p></div>
<div class="indent1"><span class="nm">(h)</span><p><span class="cl">R. Shimon:</span> The Nesachim of lambs are thicker (have less oil) than those of bulls or rams (they cannot be mixed together!) Some Nesachim (i.e. of the morning Tamid) must be mixed in the morning, and some (i.e. of the afternoon Tamid) must be mixed in the afternoon! (Really, all could be mixed individually in the morning, but all could not be put in one Kli, for part of the Nesachim (i.e. of the morning Tamid) must be offered in the morning, and part (i.e. of the afternoon Tamid) must be offered in the afternoon)</p></div>
<div class="indent1"><span class="nm">(i)</span><p><span class="cl">R. Yehudah:</span> How do you answer?</p></div>
<div class="indent1"><span class="nm">(j)</span><p><span class="cl">Answer #2 (R. Shimon):</span> "V'Chol Minchah Belulah ba'Shemen" teaches that a Minchah must be (small enough to be) mixable.</p></div>

<div class="indent2"><span class="nm">1.</span><p><span class="cl">(Mishnah):</span> If a Minchah was not mixed, it is Kosher.</p></div>
<div class="indent1"><span class="nm">(d)</span><p><span class="cl">Answer (R. Zeira):</span> If a Minchah could have been mixed, mixing is not Me'akev. If it could not have been mixed, (e.g. it is too big), mixing is Me'akev.</p></div>
<div class="indent1"><span class="nm">(e)</span><p><span class="cl">(Rav Bivi):</span> A case occurred in which Rebbi's mule died, Chachamim measured whether a Revi'is of blood came out. (A Revi'is has Tum'as Neveilah, since it could congeal to a k'Zayis.)</p></div>
