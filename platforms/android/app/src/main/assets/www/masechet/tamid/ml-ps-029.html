<p class=newsubafdaf><span class=numt>1)</span></span> THE WOOD FOR THE <i>MA'ARACHAH</i></p>
<p class=firstindent><span class=numl1>(a)</span>	They began putting wood on the Mizbe'ach to arrange the Ma'arachah (pile);</p>
<p class=secondindent><span class=numl2>1.</span>	Any wood may be used for the Ma'arachah, except for olive-wood or grapevines.</p>
<p class=secondindent><span class=numl2>2.</span>	They usually used branches of fig, nut and pine trees.</p>
<p class=firstindent><span class=numl1>(b)</span>	The Kohen (who merited to do the Terumas ha'Deshen) arranged the big Ma'arachah (on which the Tamid is burned) in the east, with an opening in the east. The ends of the long logs would touch the Tapu'ach.</p>
<p class=firstindent><span class=numl1>(c)</span>	Space was left between the logs, in which they would ignite the twigs. They would pick nice fig logs (that make coals).</p>
<p class=firstindent><span class=numl1>(d)</span>	The second Ma'arachah was for the sake of Ketores, it was four Amos north of the southwest corner;</p>
<p class=secondindent><span class=numl2>1.</span>	They would put an amount of logs estimated to make five Sa'im of coals (Gra - four Sa'im were needed);</p>
<p class=secondindent><span class=numl2>2.</span>	(This is on weekdays.) On Shabbos, they put enough for eight Sa'im. The extra coals were to burn the two sticks of Levonah of the Lechem ha'Panim.</p>
<p class=firstindent><span class=numl1>(e)</span>	Limbs and fats (from yesterday's Korbanos) that were not consumed are returned to the Ma'arachah; the two Ma'arachos were lit.</p>
<p class=firstindent><span class=numl1>(f)</span>	The Kohanim descended to the Lishkas ha'Gazis.</p>
<p class=newsubject><span class=numt>2)</span> IMPRECISE LANGUAGE</p>
<p class=firstindent><span class=numl1>(a)</span><span class=desl1>	(Gemara - Rava):</span> (The Mishnah says that sometimes there were 300 Kor (about 100,000 liters) in the Tapu'ach.) This is a Guzma (exaggeration).</p>
<p class=firstindent><span class=numl1>(b)</span><span class=desl1>	(Mishnah):</span> They gave the Tamid to drink from a gold cup.</p>
<p class=firstindent><span class=numl1>(c)</span><span class=desl1>	(Rava):</span> This is a Guzma. (Rreally, it was copper as nice as gold.)</p>
<p class=firstindent><span class=numl1>(d)</span><span class=desl1>	(R. Ami):</span> The Torah, prophets, and Chachamim all use Lashon Havai (imprecise speech);</p>
<p class=secondindent><span class=numl2>1.</span>	The Torah uses Lashon Havai -- "Arim Gedolos u'Vetzoros ba'Shamayim." Surely, the walls do not reach up to Heaven! This is a Guzma. (It would seem that the verse cited is Devarim 9:20, in which the Torah itself (i.e. Moshe) says this. however, Rashi (Devarim 1:28) and Torah Ohr attribute this teaching to Devarim 1:28, which cites the words of the Meraglim. -P. Feldman)</p>
<p class=secondindent><span class=numl2>2.</span>	Chachamim use Lashon Havai, regarding the Tapu'ach and giving the Tamid to drink from a gold cup;</p>
<p class=secondindent><span class=numl2>3.</span>	The prophets use Lashon Havai -- "va'Tibaka ha'Aretz b'Kolam (the land cleaved from their voices)."</p>
<p class=firstindent><span class=numl1>(e)</span><span class=desl1>	(Shmuel):</span> Chachamim used Lashon Havai in three places -- the Tapu'ach, the golden vine, and the Paroches (curtain in the Mikdash).</p>
<p class=secondindent><span class=numl2>1.</span>	He argues with Rava, who says that the Tamid did not really drink from a gold cup. Shmuel holds that it did. (It is not one of the three Leshonos of Havai);</p>
<p class=secondindent><span class=numl2>2.</span>	This is because we do not show poverty in the place of wealth (i.e. the Mikdash. Rather, everything is done in grandeur.)</p>
<p class=firstindent><span class=numl1>(f)</span><span class=desl1>	(Mishnah):</span> There was a golden vine on the entrance to the Heichal, supported by poles. Donations of gold grapes or clusters were hung on the vine;</p>
<p class=bbbline>29b----------------------------------------29b</p>
<p class=firstindent><span class=numl1>(g)</span>	R. Eliezer b'Rebbi Tzadok says, 300 Kohanim were needed to move it.</p>
<p class=firstindent><span class=numl1>(h)</span><span class=desl1>	(Mishnah - R. Shimon ben Gamliel):</span> The Paroches was one Tefach thick. It was made from 72 Nirim (rings on the loom through which threads pass. Ra'avad - there were 72 different pictures along its width.) Each thread was spun from 24 threads (six threads each of gold and of three colors of wool);</p>
<p class=secondindent><span class=numl2>1.</span>	It was 40 Amos long and 20 Amos wide. It was made from 820,000 Dinarim (or threads; Mefaresh - 82 young girls not prone to become Nidah);</p>
<p class=secondindent><span class=numl2>2.</span>	Every year, they made two. Three hundred Kohanim were needed to immerse it. (This is a Guzma. Me'iri (Shekalim 8:3) - also the cost is exaggerated.)</p>
<p class=newsubject><span class=numt>3)</span> THE MA'ARACHAH</p>
<p class=firstindent><span class=numl1>(a)</span><span class=desl1>	(Mishnah):</span> They began putting wood on the Mizbe'ach... any wood may be used, except for olivewood or grapevines.</p>
<p class=firstindent><span class=numl1>(b)</span><span class=desl1>	Question:</span> What is the reason?</p>
<p class=firstindent><span class=numl1>(c)</span><span class=desl1>	Answer #1 (Rav Papa):</span> These branches have bumps. (Therefore, they do not burn nicely, and they make much smoke.)</p>
<p class=firstindent><span class=numl1>(d)</span><span class=desl1>	Answer #2 (Rav Acha bar Yakov):</span> Olives and grapes are crucial to the settlement of Eretz Yisrael. Therefore we do not want to cut such trees.</p>
<p class=firstindent><span class=numl1>(e)</span><span class=desl1>	Question (Beraisa):</span> "Al ha'Etzim Asher Al ha'Esh" alludes to wood that breaks up and turns to fire (burns);</p>
<p class=secondindent><span class=numl2>1.</span>	These are reeds of young trees that burn nicely. They do not have bumps that extend to the inside;</p>
<p class=secondindent><span class=numl2>2.</span><span class=desl2>	Question:</span> Are all species of trees valid for the Ma'arachah?!</p>
<p class=secondindent><span class=numl2>3.</span><span class=desl2>	Answer:</span> Yes, all species are valid except for olivewood or grapevines. They usually used fig, nut and pine branches.</p>
<p class=secondindent><span class=numl2>4.</span>	R. Eliezer forbids also mettle, oak, date, carob and sycamore wood.</p>
<p class=secondindent><span class=numl2>5.</span>	According to Rav Papa, we understand the argument. R. Eliezer forbids them, even though the bumps do not extend to the inside. The first Tana permits them for this reason.</p>
<p class=secondindent><span class=numl2>6.</span>	However, according to Rav Acha, why does the first Tana permit date wood? Surely dates are important for the settlement of Eretz Yisrael!</p>
<p class=secondindent><span class=numl2>7.</span><span class=desl2>	Counter-question:</span> Why didn't you ask about fig wood? All agree that it was often used, even though figs are important for settlement!</p>
<p class=secondindent><span class=numl2>8.</span><span class=desl2>	Answer:</span> You must say they would use (wood of) barren fig trees (that do not produce fruit);</p>
<p class=firstindent><span class=numl1>(f)</span><span class=desl1>	Answer:</span> Likewise, they would use barren date trees!</p>
<p class=firstindent><span class=numl1>(g)</span><span class=desl1>	Question:</span> Are there really barren fig trees?!</p>
<p class=firstindent><span class=numl1>(h)</span><span class=desl1>	Answer:</span> There are, like Rachbah taught:</p>
<p class=secondindent><span class=numl2>1.</span><span class=desl2>	(Rachbah):</span> If one rubs the bark off white fig branches, if there were any seeds inside, they will fall out, the branch is sterilized.</p>
<p class=secondindent><span class=numl2>2.</span>	We plant it on the riverbank, where it is always wet. The branches grow bark, but not fruit.</p>
<p class=secondindent><span class=numl2>3.</span>	The branches are so thick that a bridge cannot bear the weight of (Rosh; Mefaresh - cannot fit) three of them.</p>
