<p class="dedicationbox">SHABBOS 13 (30 Tishrei) - dedicated by Reb Mordechai Rabin (London/Yerushalayim) l'Iluy Nishmas his father, ha'Gaon Rav Gedalya Rabinowitz of Manchester, England (and in his later years, Bnei Brak, Israel). Hearing a Shiur from Reb Gedalya was an unforgettable experience as can be attested to by his many Talmidim, both Bnei Yeshiva and Ba'alei Batim.<BR>&nbsp;<BR>12TH CYCLE SHABBOS 12-14 - These Dafim have been dedicated by Ari Friedman and family of Lawrence, N.Y., l'Iluy Nishmas Ari's late father, Reb Yakov Yosef ben Rav Nosson Neta Z'L Friedman, who passed away unexpectedly this past 30 Nisan. Always brimming with joy and generosity, Jack Friedman exemplified true Ahavas Yisrael and Ahavas Chesed. May he be a Melitz Yosher for his children and grandchildren and for all of Klal Israel. </p>

<p class="bas subject"><span class="nm">1)</span>DECREES TO PREVENT SIN</p>
<p class="bas indent1"><span class="nm">(a)</span><span class="cl">(Mishnah):</span> However, a teacher...[he himself may not read].</p>
<p class="bas indent1"><span class="nm">(b)</span><span class="cl">Question:</span> But the Reisha permits him to see where they are reading;</p>
<p class="bas indent2"><span class="nm">1.</span><span class="cl">Suggestion:</span> He also reads!</p>
<p class="bas indent1"><span class="nm">(c)</span><span class="cl">Answer:</span> He only reviews the beginning of the Parshiyos (he remembers the rest).</p>
<p class="bas indent1"><span class="nm">(d)</span><span class="cl">Question:</span> He may read the entire Parshah [just like children]!</p>
<p class="bas indent2"><span class="nm">1.</span><span class="cl">(Beraisa - R. Shimon ben Gamliel):</span> Children in the house of their Rebbi may arrange the Parshiyos and read by light of a lamp.</p>
<p class="bas indent1"><span class="nm">(e)</span><span class="cl">Answer #1:</span> Also children may read only the beginning of the Parshiyos.</p>
<p class="bas indent1"><span class="nm">(f)</span><span class="cl">Answer #2:</span> We are more lenient about children, for the fear of their Rebbi is on them.</p>
<p class="bas indent1"><span class="nm">(g)</span><span class="cl">(Mishnah):</span> Similarly, a Zav may not eat [with a Zavah...]</p>
<p class="bas indent1"><span class="nm">(h)</span><span class="cl">(Beraisa - R. Shimon ben Elazar):</span> People are very careful about Taharos!</p>
<p class="bas indent2"><span class="nm">1.</span>Even though there is no prohibition for a Zav to have relations, the Mishnah did not need to forbid a Tahor to eat with a Teme'ah (for he would not eat with her anyway, lest she Metamei his food)!</p>
<p class="bas indent2"><span class="nm">2.</span>Rather, it only needs to forbid a Zav from eating with a Zavah, lest they come to have relations.</p>
<p class="bas indent1"><span class="nm">(i)</span>Similarly - a Zav Parush (he is meticulous about Taharah) should not eat with an ignoramus Zav, lest he will cause the latter to come frequently.</p>
<p class="bas indent1"><span class="nm">(j)</span><span class="cl">Question:</span> What is wrong if the ignoramus come frequently (the Parush is Tamei anyway)!</p>
<p class="bas indent1"><span class="nm">(k)</span><span class="cl">Answer #1:</span> Rather, we are concerned that the ignoramus will give Tamei food to the Parush to eat.</p>
<p class="bas indent1"><span class="nm">(l)</span><span class="cl">Objection:</span> The Parush is eating Tamei food in any case when he is a Zav!</p>
<p class="bas indent1"><span class="nm">(m)</span><span class="cl">Answer #2 (Abaye):</span> Rather, we are concerned that the ignoramus will give untithed food to the Parush to eat.</p>
<p class="bas indent1"><span class="nm">(n)</span><span class="cl">Objection (Rava):</span> Most ignoramuses tithe properly (we would not decree on account of the minority)!</p>
<p class="bas indent1"><span class="nm">(o)</span><span class="cl">Answer #3 (Rava):</span> Rather, we are concerned that when the Parush is Tahor, the ignoramus will give Tamei food to him to eat.</p>
<p class="bas subject"><span class="nm">2)</span>MAY ONE SLEEP IN THE SAME BED WITH A <i>NIDAH</i>?</p>
<p class="bas indent1"><span class="nm">(a)</span><span class="cl">Question:</span> May a Nidah sleep [in the same bed] with her husband, when each is in his or her own garment?</p>
<p class="bas indent1"><span class="nm">(b)</span><span class="cl">Answer #1 (Rav Yosef -- Mishnah - Beis Shamai):</span> Fowl may be put on the same table as cheese, but they may not be eaten together;</p>
<p class="bas indent2"><span class="nm">1.</span>Beis Hillel say, they may not be put on the same table nor eaten together. (Likewise, we decree regarding a Nidah - the Halachah follows Beis Hillel. Also, perhaps even Beis Shamai would agree that we decree concerning Nidah, it is mid'Oraisa.)</p>
<p class="bas indent1"><span class="nm">(c)</span><span class="cl">Rejection:</span> Perhaps we need not decree about Nidah, since there are two people (if one forgets, the other will remind him).</p>
<p class="bas indent1"><span class="nm">(d)</span><span class="cl">Version #1 - Support of Rejection:</span> The Seifa of that Mishnah shows that we need not decree when there are two people!</p>
<p class="bas indent2"><span class="nm">1.</span><span class="cl">(Mishnah - R. Shimon ben Gamliel):</span> Two lodgers may eat at the same table, one meat and the other cheese, we are not concerned.</p>
<p class="bas indent1"><span class="nm">(e)</span><span class="cl">Objection:</span> R. Chanan bar Ami taught, this is only if they do not know each other, but if they know each other, it is forbidden;</p>
<p class="bas indent2"><span class="nm">1.</span>Here also, the husband and wife know each other, it should be forbidden!</p>
<p class="bas indent1"><span class="nm">(f)</span><span class="cl">Answer:</span> Lodgers that know each other are forbidden, for even though there are two of them, there is no Shinuy (something different to remind them not to share food);</p>
<p class="bas indent2"><span class="nm">1.</span>Here, the question is if they may sleep together with a Shinuy, i.e. each is clothed (normally, they sleep unclothed).</p>
<p class="bas indent1"><span class="nm">(g)</span><span class="cl">Version #2 - Support (of Rav Yosef - Mishnah - R. Shimon ben Gamliel):</span> Two lodgers may eat at the same table, one meat and the other cheese, we are not concerned;</p>
<p class="bas indent2"><span class="nm">1.</span><span class="cl">(R. Chanan bar Ami):</span> This is only if they do not know each other, but if they know each other, it is forbidden.</p>
<p class="bas indent2"><span class="nm">2.</span>Here also, the husband and wife know each other, it is forbidden!</p>
<p class="bas indent1"><span class="nm">(h)</span><span class="cl">Rejection:</span> Lodgers that know each other are forbidden, for even though there are two of them, there is no Shinuy - here, there is a Shinuy! (end of Version #2)</p>
<p class="bas indent1"><span class="nm">(i)</span><span class="cl">Support (for Rav Yosef - Mishnah):</span> Similarly, a Zav may not eat [with a Zavah...]</p>
<p class="bas indent1"><span class="nm">(j)</span><span class="cl">Rejection:</span> There also, there are two people, but there is no Shinuy!</p>
<p class="bas indent1"><span class="nm">(k)</span><span class="cl">Support (for Rav Yosef - Beraisa):</span> "...V'Es Eshes Re'ehu Lo Timei v'el Ishah Nidah Lo Yikrav" - the verse equates a Nidah to another man's wife:</p>
<p class="bas indent2"><span class="nm">1.</span>Just like one may not sleep [in the same bed] with another man's wife (even seclusion with her is forbidden), even if both are clothed, the same applies to one's own wife when she is Nidah.</p>
<p class="bas indent1"><span class="nm">(l)</span>Rav Yosef argues with R. Pedas:</p>
<p class="bas indent2"><span class="nm">1.</span><span class="cl">(R. Pedas):</span> (It says "Lo Sikrevu Legalos Ervah" -) the Torah forbids only actual relations with Ervah.</p>
<p class="bas indent1"><span class="nm">(m)</span>When Ula would come home from learning, he would kiss his sisters on the [garment over their] chest; some say, on the arm. (Tosfos - he was a total Tzadik, he was sure that this would not have cause him to have lust. Chasam Sofer - this is a Mashal for the way he embraced Chachmah - nevertheless, the Gemara challenges this [immediately], for one should not use a Mashal of doing an Isur.)</p>
<p class="bas indent1"><span class="nm">(n)</span>Ula contradicts himself!</p>
<p class="bas indent2"><span class="nm">1.</span><span class="cl">(Ula):</span> Even approaching Arayos is forbidden - 'Lech Lech Amri Nezira...' (one must distance himself from sin).</p>
<p class="bas indent1"><span class="nm">(o)</span><span class="cl">(Tana d'vei Eliyahu):</span> A case occurred, a Talmid who had learned and served Chachamim greatly died very young. His wife took his Tefilin around to Batei Medrash and synagogues, and asked:</p>
<p class="bas indent2"><span class="nm">1.</span>It says "Ki Hi Orech Yamecha" - my husband learned and served Chachamim greatly, why did he die young?!</p>
<p class="bas bbbline">13b----------------------------------------13b</p>
<p class="bas indent2"><span class="nm">2.</span>No one answered her. Once, I (Eliyahu) stayed by her - she told the story to me.</p>
<p class="bas indent2"><span class="nm">3.</span><span class="cl">Eliyahu:</span> How did he act with you when you were Nidah?</p>
<p class="bas indent2"><span class="nm">4.</span><span class="cl">The widow:</span> He didn't even touch my pinky!</p>
<p class="bas indent2"><span class="nm">5.</span><span class="cl">Eliyahu:</span> How did he act with you when you were counting seven clean days? (Rashi - after Zivah, she is still like a Nidah until immersing; R. Tam - she already immersed and was Tehorah mid'Oraisa, but all Benos Yisrael are concerned for Zivah, to require seven clean days before immersing after any sighting of blood.)</p>
<p class="bas indent2"><span class="nm">6.</span><span class="cl">The widow:</span> He would eat and drink with me and sleep [in the same bed] without clothes [on either of us], but he never even considered relations!</p>
<p class="bas indent2"><span class="nm">7.</span><span class="cl">Eliyahu:</span> Blessed is Hash-m who killed him, and did not show partiality [to overlook his Mezid transgression] on account of his Torah! It says "V'El Ishah b'Nidas Tum'asah Lo Sikrav"!</p>
<p class="bas indent1"><span class="nm">(p)</span><span class="cl">(Rav Dimi):</span> The Talmid had one [wide] bed (and would not contact her, therefore he was lenient to sleep with her).</p>
<p class="bas indent1"><span class="nm">(q)</span><span class="cl">(Rav Yitzchak bar Yosef):</span> She used to wear a garment over her Ervah (therefore he was lenient).</p>
<p class="bas subject"><span class="nm">3)</span>THE EIGHTEEN DECREES</p>
<p class="bas indent1"><span class="nm">(a)</span><span class="cl">(Mishnah):</span> These are among the Halachos said in the attic of Chananyah ben Chizkiyah when Chachamim came to visit him (this will be explained);</p>
<p class="bas indent1"><span class="nm">(b)</span>They counted, and found that Beis Shamai outnumbered Beis Hillel; they decreed 18 things that day.</p>
<p class="bas indent1"><span class="nm">(c)</span><span class="cl">(Gemara - Abaye) Question:</span> Does the Mishnah say 'Elu' (these, i.e. the following) Halachos, or 'v'Elu' (the previous) Halachos?</p>
<p class="bas indent1"><span class="nm">(d)</span><span class="cl">Answer (Rav Yosef - Beraisa):</span> One may not delouse clothing nor read by light of a lamp - these are among the Halachos said in the attic of Chananyah.</p>
<p class="bas indent2"><span class="nm">1.</span>This shows that the text is 'v'Elu'.</p>
<p class="bas indent1"><span class="nm">(e)</span><span class="cl">(Beraisa) Question:</span> Who wrote Megilas Ta'anis (days when it is forbidden to fast or eulogize, on account of miracles done for Yisrael)?</p>
<p class="bas indent1"><span class="nm">(f)</span><span class="cl">Answer:</span> Chananyah ben Chizkiyah and his colleagues wrote it, they afflictions [and the salvation from them] were very dear to them;</p>
<p class="bas indent1"><span class="nm">(g)</span>R. Shimon ben Gamliel says, afflictions are dear to us also - but if we would write them all, we would not finish (alternatively - we could not make every day a Yom Tov)!</p>
<p class="bas indent1"><span class="nm">(h)</span>Also - a fool does not recognize when he is stricken (we do not know many of the miracles done for us)!</p>
<p class="bas indent1"><span class="nm">(i)</span>Also - flesh of a Mes does not feel when it is cut (we have suffered so much, we barely feel the afflictions and salvations).</p>
<p class="bas indent1"><span class="nm">(j)</span><span class="cl">Question:</span> But R. Yitzchak taught, "Ach Besaro Alav Yich'av v'Nafsho Alav Te'eval" - worms [consuming a Mes] hurt it like a needle hurts live flesh!</p>
<p class="bas indent1"><span class="nm">(k)</span><span class="cl">Correction:</span> Dead flesh of a live person does not feel when it is cut.</p>
<p class="bas indent1"><span class="nm">(l)</span><span class="cl">(Rav Yehudah):</span> Blessed is Chananyah ben Chizkiyah - if not for him, Sefer Yechezkeil would have been Nignaz (buried), for it [seemingly] contradicts the Torah!</p>
<p class="bas indent2"><span class="nm">1.</span>Chananyah brought 300 barrels of oil up to his attic [to enable learning at night] and resolved the difficulties.</p>
<p class="bas indent1"><span class="nm">(m)</span><span class="cl">(Mishnah):</span> They decreed 18 things.</p>
<p class="bas indent1"><span class="nm">(n)</span><span class="cl">Question:</span> What are other decrees [among the 18]? (We already mentioned (1) delousing and (2) reading by light of a lamp. The Gemara will complete the count of 18 on Daf 17B. We count according to Rashi (17B).)</p>
<p class="bas indent1"><span class="nm">(o)</span><span class="cl">Answer (Decrees #3-11) (Mishnah):</span> The following Posel Terumah (make it a Shelishi l'Tum'ah) - one who eats a Rishon (3) or Sheni l'Tum'ah (4), or drank Tamei liquids (5) (all of the decrees will be explained);</p>
<p class="bas indent2"><span class="nm">1.</span>[A Tevul Yom, i.e. one who immersed from Tum'ah today] who entered his head or the majority of his body in Mayim She'uvim (water that was in a Kli) (6) (even after nightfall, he is Posel Terumah until he immerses again) or even one who is [fully] Tahor who had three Lugim of Mayim She'uvim poured on his head (7);</p>
<p class="bas indent2"><span class="nm">2.</span>One who touched a Sefer [Torah, Nevi'im or Kesuvim] (8), [Stam] hands (9) (they have not been guarded in Taharah);</p>
<p class="bas indent2"><span class="nm">3.</span>A Tevul Yom (9), food (10) or vessels (11) that became Tamei through liquids,</p>
<p class="bas normal"></p>
