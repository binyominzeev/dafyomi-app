<p class="dedicationbox">BAVA BASRA 160 - A week of learning has been dedicated towards meriting a Refu'ah Sheleimah for Eliezer Lipa ben Yetta, by Mr. and Mrs. Kornfeld of Yerushalayim. </p>

<p class="bas subject"><span class="nm">1)</span>THE SOURCE FOR TIED GITIN</p>
<p class="bas indent1"><span class="nm">(a)</span><span class="cl">(Mishnah):</span> In a standard Get, the witnesses are on the inside (i.e. the same side as the text). In a tied Get, the witnesses are on the outside (i.e. the opposite side from the text).</p>
<p class="bas indent1"><span class="nm">(b)</span>If witnesses signed on the outside of a standard Get, or on the inside of a tied Get, it is invalid.</p>
<p class="bas indent1"><span class="nm">(c)</span>R. Chanina ben Gamliel says, if witnesses signed on the inside of a tied Get, it is valid, because it can be converted to a standard Get.</p>
<p class="bas indent1"><span class="nm">(d)</span>R. Shimon ben Gamliel says, everything follows the local custom.</p>
<p class="bas indent1"><span class="nm">(e)</span>A standard Get requires (at least) two witnesses. A tied Get requires (at least) three;</p>
<p class="bas indent2"><span class="nm">1.</span>A standard Get with only one witness or a tied Get with only two witnesses is invalid.</p>
<p class="bas indent1"><span class="nm">(f)</span><span class="cl">(Gemara) Question:</span> What is the source of this?</p>
<p class="bas indent1"><span class="nm">(g)</span><span class="cl">Answer #1 (R. Chanina):</span> "Sados ba'Kesef Yiknu v'Chasuv ba'Sefer" refers to a standard Get;</p>
<p class="bas bbbline">160b----------------------------------------160b</p>
<p class="bas indent2"><span class="nm">1.</span>"V'Chasom" refers to a tied Get;</p>
<p class="bas indent2"><span class="nm">2.</span>"V'Ha'ed" refers to two witnesses (unless the Torah specifies otherwise). "Edim" teaches a third witness.</p>
<p class="bas indent2"><span class="nm">3.</span>This teaches that a standard Get requires two witnesses, and a tied Get requires three.</p>
<p class="bas indent2"><span class="nm">4.</span><span class="cl">Suggestion:</span> Perhaps we should say vice-versa!</p>
<p class="bas indent2"><span class="nm">5.</span><span class="cl">Rejection:</span> Because a tied Get has extra knots (the Torah makes it harder to write, presumably) it requires more witnesses.</p>
<p class="bas indent1"><span class="nm">(h)</span><span class="cl">Answer #2 (Rafram):</span> "Va'Ekach Es Sefer ha'Miknah" refers to a standard Get;</p>
<p class="bas indent2"><span class="nm">1.</span>"Es ha'Chasum" refers to a tied Get;</p>
<p class="bas indent2"><span class="nm">2.</span>"V'Es ha'Galuy" is the text of a tied Get;</p>
<p class="bas indent2"><span class="nm">3.</span>"Ha'Mitzvah veha'Chukim" are the differences between standard and tied Gitin.</p>
<p class="bas indent2"><span class="nm">4.</span><span class="cl">Question:</span> What are the differences?</p>
<p class="bas indent2"><span class="nm">5.</span><span class="cl">Answer:</span> A standard Get requires two witnesses, and they sign on the inside. A tied Get requires three witnesses, and they sign on the outside.</p>
<p class="bas indent2"><span class="nm">6.</span><span class="cl">Suggestion:</span> Perhaps we should say vice-versa (about the number of witnesses)!</p>
<p class="bas indent2"><span class="nm">7.</span><span class="cl">Rejection:</span> Because a tied Get has extra knots, it requires more witnesses.</p>
<p class="bas indent1"><span class="nm">(i)</span><span class="cl">Answer #3 (Rami bar Yechezkeil) Question:</span> "A matter will be established based on two or three witnesses" - if two witnesses suffice, why does the Torah mention three?</p>
<p class="bas indent2"><span class="nm">1.</span><span class="cl">Answer:</span> This teaches that a standard Get requires two witnesses, a tied Get requires three.</p>
<p class="bas indent2"><span class="nm">2.</span><span class="cl">Suggestion:</span> Perhaps we should say vice-versa!</p>
<p class="bas indent2"><span class="nm">3.</span><span class="cl">Rejection:</span> Because a tied Get has extra knots, it requires more witnesses.</p>
<p class="bas indent1"><span class="nm">(j)</span><span class="cl">Objection:</span> Each of these three verses teaches something else!</p>
<p class="bas indent2"><span class="nm">1.</span><span class="cl">(Beraisa):</span> "Sados ba'Kesef Yiknu v'Chasuv ba'Sefer va'Chasom" teaches good counsel (to keep signed documents for proof);</p>
<p class="bas indent2"><span class="nm">2.</span>"Va'Ekach Es Sefer ha'Miknah" (does not teach anything. It) merely records what he did;</p>
<p class="bas indent2"><span class="nm">3.</span>"A matter will be established based on two or three witnesses" equates two witnesses to three witnesses regarding Hazamah (if we find that witnesses were not present where they claimed to see the testimony, they are disqualified and they suffer whatever they sought to obligate the defendant). R. Akiva and Chachamim argue about precisely what we learn from it.</p>
<p class="bas indent1"><span class="nm">(k)</span><span class="cl">Answer #4:</span> Chachamim enacted tied Gitin. The verses are mere Asmachtos.</p>
<p class="bas indent1"><span class="nm">(l)</span><span class="cl">Question:</span> Why did Chachamim enact them?</p>
<p class="bas indent1"><span class="nm">(m)</span><span class="cl">Answer:</span> There was a region of impetuous Kohanim. They were hasty to divorce (and could not remarry their wives);</p>
<p class="bas indent2"><span class="nm">1.</span>Chachamim enacted tied Gitin. They take longer to write, and perhaps the husband will calm down in the meantime and not divorce his wife.</p>
<p class="bas indent1"><span class="nm">(n)</span><span class="cl">Question:</span> That explains tied Gitin of divorce. Why are there tied monetary Gitin?</p>
<p class="bas indent1"><span class="nm">(o)</span><span class="cl">Answer:</span> This is so there will not be differences between Gitin of divorce and money.</p>
<p class="bas subject"><span class="nm">2)</span>WHERE WE SIGN TIED GITIN</p>
<p class="bas indent1"><span class="nm">(a)</span><span class="cl">Question:</span> Where do the witnesses sign a tied Get?</p>
<p class="bas indent1"><span class="nm">(b)</span><span class="cl">Answer #1 (Rav Huna):</span> They sign in between the places where it is tied. (We are thinking that they sign on the inside, i.e. the same side as the text.)</p>
<p class="bas indent1"><span class="nm">(c)</span><span class="cl">Answer #2 (R. Yirmeyah bar Aba):</span> They sign opposite the text, corresponding to where the text is.</p>
<p class="bas indent1"><span class="nm">(d)</span><span class="cl">Question (Rami bar Chama):</span> How does Rav Huna explain the following episode?</p>
<p class="bas indent2"><span class="nm">1.</span>A tied Get was brought in front of Rebbi. He remarked 'it has no date'!</p>
<p class="bas indent2"><span class="nm">2.</span><span class="cl">R. Shimon b'Rebbi:</span> Perhaps it is between the places where it is tied.</p>
<p class="bas indent2"><span class="nm">3.</span>Rebbi untied it, and found that this was so.</p>
<p class="bas indent2"><span class="nm">4.</span><span class="cl">Summation of question:</span> According to Rav Huna, Rebbi should also have remarked that the Get has no witnesses!</p>
<p class="bas indent1"><span class="nm">(e)</span><span class="cl">Answer (Rav Chisda):</span> Rav Huna says that they sign in between the places where it is tied, on the <i>outside</i>.</p>
<p class="bas indent1"><span class="nm">(f)</span><span class="cl">Question:</span> (Since they do not sign under the text), we should be concerned lest the bearer of the document add (clauses to his advantage) to the text after they signed!</p>
<p class="bas indent1"><span class="nm">(g)</span><span class="cl">Answer:</span> The text says 'Sharir v'Kayam' (this indicates the end of the document).</p>
<p class="bas indent1"><span class="nm">(h)</span><span class="cl">Question:</span> Perhaps he will add to the text, and write another 'Sharir v'Kayam'!</p>
<p class="bas indent1"><span class="nm">(i)</span><span class="cl">Answer:</span> A document may say 'Sharir v'Kayam' only once.</p>
<p class="bas indent1"><span class="nm">(j)</span><span class="cl">Question:</span> Perhaps he will erase the first 'Sharir v'Kayam', add to the text, and write 'Sharir v'Kayam'!</p>
<p class="bas indent1"><span class="nm">(k)</span><span class="cl">Answer:</span> R. Yochanan taught that if words were written between the lines, and the document mentions them at the end, it is valid;</p>
<p class="bas indent2"><span class="nm">1.</span>An erasure invalidates a Get, even if the document mentions it at the end.</p>
<p class="bas indent2"><span class="nm">2.</span>An erasure invalidates a Get only if it is in a place fitting and large enough for it to say 'Sharir v'Kayam' (due to this concern)!</p>
