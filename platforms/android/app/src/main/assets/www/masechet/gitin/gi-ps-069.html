<p class="bas subject"><span class="nm">1)</span>CURES FOR HEAD AILMENTS</p>
<p class="bas indent1"><span class="nm">(a)</span>For Beruksi (a protrusion from the eye), one makes a mixture of eye shadow and ground dried scorpion. This is applied three times (not more!) to each eye.</p>
<p class="bas indent1"><span class="nm">(b)</span>For night blindness, one ties a rope of animal hair to his leg on one side, and to a dog on the other side. Children bang pottery, an incantation is recited, and he collects meat from seven houses, and eats it near wasteheaps. The rope is removed from his leg, and they blow into the dog's eye.</p>
<p class="bas indent1"><span class="nm">(c)</span>For day blindness, seven spleens are roasted on a bloodletter's flask. The patient requests them from a healthy person outside the house. After eating them, he breaks the flask (so the blindness will not return).</p>
<p class="bas indent1"><span class="nm">(d)</span>For a nosebleed, one finds a Kohen named 'Levi', and tells him to write 'Levi' backwards;</p>
<p class="bas indent2"><span class="nm">1.</span>If not, certain other charms may be written by any person.</p>
<p class="bas indent2"><span class="nm">2.</span>Alternatively, one may burn together fodder... to make ashes. One inserts in each nostril a strand of wool dipped in vinegar and rolled in the ashes;</p>
<p class="bas indent2"><span class="nm">3.</span>Alternatively, he straddles an irrigation channel that flows from east to west and takes in each hand mud from under the opposite foot. He inserts in each nostril a strand of wool dipped in the mud.</p>
<p class="bas indent2"><span class="nm">4.</span>Alternatively, he sits under a gutter pipe, and others pour water on him through the pipe and recite a charm.</p>
<p class="bas indent1"><span class="nm">(e)</span>For a bleeding mouth, we take straw of wheat to see if the blood sticks to it.</p>
<p class="bas indent2"><span class="nm">1.</span>If it sticks, the blood is from the lungs. This can be cured;</p>
<p class="bas indent2"><span class="nm">2.</span>If it does not stick, it is from the liver. There is no cure.</p>
<p class="bas indent2"><span class="nm">3.</span><span class="cl">Question (Rav Ami - Mishnah):</span> If an animal's liver was entirely removed, or if the lung was punctured or lacking, the animal is Treifah. (This shows that a wound in the lungs is more severe than one in the liver!)</p>
<p class="bas indent2"><span class="nm">4.</span><span class="cl">Answer (Rav Ashi):</span> If the blood of the liver comes through the mouth, this shows that the liver has totally dissolved.</p>
<p class="bas indent2"><span class="nm">5.</span>If the blood is from the lungs, one cooks a mixture of beets, etc. and eats it, then drinks strong beer made in Teves.</p>
<p class="bas indent1"><span class="nm">(f)</span>For ailing inner teeth, one grinds garlic, oil and salt, puts the mixture on the thumbnail, and surrounds it with dough.</p>
<p class="bas indent2"><span class="nm">1.</span>The garlic must not touch the flesh, lest it cause Tzara'as.</p>
<p class="bas indent1"><span class="nm">(g)</span>For quinsy (a swollen throat with blisters), first, one puts a certain root or leaves in the mouth to prevent excessive swelling;</p>
<p class="bas indent2"><span class="nm">1.</span>One puts a nut's volume of bran, etc. in his mouth to gather the pus in the blisters;</p>
<p class="bas indent2"><span class="nm">2.</span>Another person blows white cress seeds into the patient's mouth through a straw, to burst the blisters;</p>
<p class="bas indent2"><span class="nm">3.</span>One takes honey mixed with soil that was shaded by a privy.</p>
<p class="bas indent1"><span class="nm">(h)</span>For an inflammation of the lining of the nose and throat - one cooks ammoniac, etc. until the ammoniac is fully cooked (for then all the ingredients are fully cooked), and drinks it.</p>
<p class="bas indent2"><span class="nm">1.</span>Alternatively, he cooks milk of a white goat with twigs, and drinks it.</p>
<p class="bas bbbline">69b----------------------------------------69b</p>
<p class="bas indent2"><span class="nm">2.</span>If neither is possible, he eats excrement of a white dog kneaded with balsam. (Preferably, one should avoid eating excrement, for this disconnects the limbs.)</p>
<p class="bas subject"><span class="nm">2)</span>ALIMENTS OF THE HEART AND DIGESTIVE TRACT</p>
<p class="bas indent1"><span class="nm">(a)</span>For a sharp pain, one drinks water poured over an arrow shaped rock;</p>
<p class="bas indent1"><span class="nm">(b)</span>Alternatively, one drinks water from which a dog drank at night.</p>
<p class="bas indent2"><span class="nm">1.</span>This should be taken from a place where snakes are not found, for the water was uncovered.</p>
<p class="bas indent2"><span class="nm">2.</span>One who drank exposed water should drink a Revi'is of undiluted wine.</p>
<p class="bas indent1"><span class="nm">(c)</span>For an abscess, one drinks a Revi'is of undiluted wine mixed with red aloe.</p>
<p class="bas indent1"><span class="nm">(d)</span>For heart palpitations, one eats three loaves of soaked barley bread, then drinks diluted wine.</p>
<p class="bas indent1"><span class="nm">(e)</span><span class="cl">Objection (Rav Acha mi'Difti):</span> That will surely aggravate the problem!</p>
<p class="bas indent1"><span class="nm">(f)</span><span class="cl">Correction (Ravina):</span> This remedy is for a heavy heart. For a fluttering heart, one eats three loaves of wheat bread soaked in honey and drinks undiluted wine.</p>
<p class="bas indent1"><span class="nm">(g)</span>For heart pain, one eats mint, cumin and sesame.</p>
<p class="bas indent1"><span class="nm">(h)</span>For intestinal pain, for three days, one eats 100 peppers with wine each day.</p>
<p class="bas indent2"><span class="nm">1.</span>Ravin of Nerash used 150 of our (smaller) peppers (i.e. of Bavel) to cure Rav Ashi's daughter.</p>
<p class="bas indent1"><span class="nm">(i)</span>For intestinal worms, one drinks a Revi'is of wine through a leaf.</p>
<p class="bas indent1"><span class="nm">(j)</span>For white intestinal worms, one wraps a certain seed in cotton cloth, and soaks it in water. One drinks the water, making sure not to drink the seed, lest it puncture the intestines.</p>
<p class="bas indent1"><span class="nm">(k)</span>To stop diarrhea, one eats a fresh mint plant soaked in water. To relieve constipation, one eats a dry mint plant soaked in water.</p>
<p class="bas indent1"><span class="nm">(l)</span>For an inflated spleen, one dries out seven water leeches, and drinks them in wine, in the course of three days.</p>
<p class="bas indent2"><span class="nm">1.</span>Alternatively, one takes the spleen of a goat that has not borne children, sticks it to the inside of an oven and recites an incantation.</p>
<p class="bas indent2"><span class="nm">2.</span>If he lacks an oven, he can stick the spleen between the bricks of a new house.</p>
<p class="bas indent2"><span class="nm">3.</span>Alternatively, one takes the hand of one who died on Shabbos, puts it on his spleen and recites an incantation.</p>
<p class="bas indent2"><span class="nm">4.</span>Alternatively, he roasts a fish on a smith's coals, eats it dipped in the smith's water, then drinks this water.</p>
<p class="bas indent3"><span class="nm">i.</span>A goat that used to drink a smith's water was (slaughtered, and) found to have no spleen.</p>
<p class="bas indent2"><span class="nm">5.</span>Alternatively, he should drink much wine.</p>
<p class="bas indent2"><span class="nm">6.</span><span class="cl">Objection (Rav Acha brei d'Rava):</span> If he has much wine to drink, he will never have the problem to begin with!</p>
<p class="bas indent3"><span class="nm">i.</span>Rather, he should accustom himself to eating bread each morning. This helps the entire body.</p>
<p class="bas indent1"><span class="nm">(m)</span>For hemorrhoids one wraps acacia, etc. in flax or cotton and puts it on the afflicted area.</p>
<p class="bas indent2"><span class="nm">1.</span>Alternatively, he drinks diluted beer.</p>
<p class="bas indent1"><span class="nm">(n)</span>For haunches, one takes brine of small fish and rolls it 60 times on each hip.</p>
<p class="bas indent1"><span class="nm">(o)</span>For kidney stones, one takes three drops each of tar oil, leek juice and clean wine, and puts them in the place of urination.</p>
<p class="bas indent2"><span class="nm">1.</span>Alternatively, one hangs from the Ever the handle of a flask, or a red thread spun by a woman of ill repute, or a louse from a man and a louse from a woman.</p>
<p class="bas indent2"><span class="nm">2.</span>The patient should urinate on a dry bush.</p>
<p class="bas indent3"><span class="nm">i.</span>When the stone leaves, he should keep it. It relieves fevers.</p>
<p class="bas indent1"><span class="nm">(p)</span>For external fever, one boils (separately) date pits and special leaves, and sits between them. He pours the water in two basins. He rests a table on them, and sits on it (on top of one basin). He alternates sitting over the two basins.</p>
<p class="bas indent2"><span class="nm">1.</span>After the vapors enter his body, he bathes in the waters, and drinks from the water of the leaves.</p>
<p class="bas indent2"><span class="nm">2.</span>He should not drink water from the date pits, for this causes sterility.</p>
<p class="bas indent1"><span class="nm">(q)</span>For internal fever, one brings beets that grew in seven patches, and cooks them with the soil they grew in. He eats them and drinks beer with leaves;</p>
<p class="bas indent2"><span class="nm">1.</span>Alternatively, he eats grapes of a vine draped over a date tree, with water.</p>
