<div class="subject"><span class="nm">1)</span><p>THE LAW OF TZARAS ERVAH</p></div>
<div class="indent1"><span class="nm">(a)</span><p><span class="cl">(Beraisa):</span> In the days of R. Dosa ben Harkinas, Tzaras ha'Bas was permitted to the brothers.</p></div>
<div class="indent1"><span class="nm">(b)</span><p><span class="cl">Conclusion:</span> This proves that they followed their own teachings.</p></div>
<div class="indent1"><span class="nm">(c)</span><p><span class="cl">(Beraisa):</span> In the days of R. Dosa, Tzaras ha'Bas was permitted. Chachamim were very pained, because (they thought that he permitted it, and) he was a great Chacham but he could not come to the Beis Medrash because he was blind. Three Chachamim came to him.</p></div>
<div class="indent1"><span class="nm">(d)</span><p><span class="cl">Chachamim:</span> What is the law of Tzaras ha'Bas?</p></div>
<div class="indent1"><span class="nm">(e)</span><p><span class="cl">R. Dosa:</span> Beis Shamai and Beis Hillel argue about this. The Halachah follows Beis Hillel.</p></div>
<div class="indent1"><span class="nm">(f)</span><p><span class="cl">Chachamim:</span> We heard in your name that the Halachah follows Beis Shamai!</p></div>
<div class="indent1"><span class="nm">(g)</span><p><span class="cl">R. Dosa:</span> Did you hear this in my name, or in the name of Ben Harkinas?</p></div>
<div class="indent1"><span class="nm">(h)</span><p><span class="cl">Chachamim:</span> We heard only 'Ben Harkinas'.</p></div>
<div class="indent1"><span class="nm">(i)</span><p><span class="cl">R. Dosa:</span> It was my brother Yonasan, a student of Shamai. Beware! He has 300 proofs to permit Tzaras ha'Bas. I testify that Chagai the Navi said three laws in this place:</p></div>
<div class="indent2"><span class="nm">1.</span><p>Tzaras ha'Bas is forbidden;</p></div>
<div class="indent2"><span class="nm">2.</span><p>In Amon and Mo'av, we separate Ma'aser Oni in Shemitah (the seventh year).</p></div>
<div class="indent2"><span class="nm">3.</span><p>We accept converts from Karduyin and Tarmudim.</p></div>
<div class="indent1"><span class="nm">(j)</span><p>Yonasan encountered R. Akiva, stumped him, and insulted him. R. Akiva bore it gracefully with humility.</p></div>
<div class="indent1"><span class="nm">(k)</span><p><span class="cl">(Beraisa):</span> In Amon and Mo'av, we separate Ma'aser Oni in Shemitah.</p></div>
<div class="indent2"><span class="nm">1.</span><p>We learned that many cities were conquered by Bnei Yisrael that left Mitzrayim, but were not conquered by the exiles who returned from Bavel;</p></div>
<div class="indent2"><span class="nm">2.</span><p>The first Kedushah of Eretz Yisrael was not permanent. The returning exiles left some cities without Kedushah so they could be (farmed and) a source of food for the poor in Shemitah.</p></div>
<div class="subject"><span class="nm">2)</span><p>ACCEPTING CONVERTS</p></div>
<div class="indent1"><span class="nm">(a)</span><p><span class="cl">(Beraisa #1):</span> We accept Karduyim and Tarmudim to become converts.</p></div>
<div class="indent1"><span class="nm">(b)</span><p><span class="cl">Version #1 - Contradiction (Rami bar Yechezkel's Beraisa):</span> We do not accept Karduyim!</p></div>
<div class="indent1"><span class="nm">(c)</span><p><span class="cl">Answer (Rav Ashi):</span> He taught that we do not accept <i>Kartuyim</i>.</p></div>
<div class="indent2"><span class="nm">1.</span><p>This is like people say, that Kartuyim are Pesulim (regarding lineage).</p></div>
<div class="indent1"><span class="nm">(d)</span><p><span class="cl">Version #2 (Rami bar Yechezkel - Beraisa):</span> We do not accept Kartuyim.</p></div>
<div class="indent1"><span class="nm">(e)</span><p><span class="cl">Suggestion:</span> Kartuyim and Karduyim are the same (and this contradicts Beraisa #1)!</p></div>
<div class="indent1"><span class="nm">(f)</span><p><span class="cl">Rejection (Rav Ashi):</span> No, they are different.</p></div>
<div class="indent2"><span class="nm">1.</span><p>This is like people say, that Kartuyim are Pesulim.</p></div>
<div class="indent1"><span class="nm">(g)</span><p><span class="cl">(R. Yochanan and elders):</span> We do not accept converts from Tarmod.</p></div>
<div class="indent1"><span class="nm">(h)</span><p><span class="cl">Question:</span> R. Yochanan taught otherwise!</p></div>
<div class="indent2"><span class="nm">1.</span><p><span class="cl">(Mishnah):</span> Stains (of blood on garments) that come from Rekem are Tehorim;</p></div>
<div class="indent2"><span class="nm">2.</span><p>R. Yehudah says they are Tamei, because they are converts who erred. (Rashi - they abandoned Torah. Chachamim decreed that their stains are Tamei, like Dam Nidah of Yisraelim.)</p></div>
<div class="indent2"><span class="nm">3.</span><p>Stains that come from Nochrim are Tehorim.</p></div>
<div class="bbbline">16b----------------------------------------16b</p></div>
<div class="indent2"><span class="nm">4.</span><p><span class="cl">Inference:</span> The Mishnah did not specify. This implies that stains of all Nochrim are Tehorim, even from Tarmod!</p></div>
<div class="indent2"><span class="nm">5.</span><p><span class="cl">(R. Yochanan):</span> This teaches that we accept converts from Tarmod (and may marry them. We are not concerned lest they are (Mamzerim) Yisraelim.)</p></div>
<div class="indent1"><span class="nm">(i)</span><p><span class="cl">Answer:</span> R. Yochanan observed that the Mishnah holds that way; he himself disagrees.</p></div>
<div class="indent1"><span class="nm">(j)</span><p><span class="cl">Question:</span> R. Yochanan taught that the Halachah follows a Stam Mishnah!</p></div>
<div class="indent1"><span class="nm">(k)</span><p><span class="cl">Answer:</span> Amora'im disagree about the opinion of R. Yochanan. (He taught only one of these.)</p></div>
<div class="indent1"><span class="nm">(l)</span><p><span class="cl">Question:</span> What is the reason not to accept converts from Tarmod?</p></div>
<div class="indent1"><span class="nm">(m)</span><p><span class="cl">Answer #1 (R. Yochanan or the elders):</span> (We are concerned lest they descend from) the slaves of Shlomo;</p></div>
<div class="indent1"><span class="nm">(n)</span><p><span class="cl">Answer #2 (The other of R. Yochanan and the elders):</span> (Perhaps they descend from) girls of Yerushalayim (this will be explained).</p></div>
<div class="indent1"><span class="nm">(o)</span><p>We understand Answer #1. He holds that the child of a Bas Yisrael from a Nochri or slave is a Mamzer.</p></div>
<div class="indent1"><span class="nm">(p)</span><p><span class="cl">Question:</span> According to Answer #2, what was the problem with Benos Yerushalayim?</p></div>
<div class="indent1"><span class="nm">(q)</span><p><span class="cl">Answer (Rabah bar bar Chanah and Chachamim):</span> When the Nochrim entered the Heichal (at the time of the first Churban), most Nochrim engaged in taking gold and silver. Twelve thousand men and (or including) 6,000 archers turned to Benos Yerushalayim - "They afflicted women in Tziyon, virgins in the cities of Yehudah."</p></div>
<div class="subject"><span class="nm">3)</span><p>AGADIC TEACHINGS OF R. SHMUEL BAR NACHMANI</p></div>
<div class="indent1"><span class="nm">(a)</span><p><span class="cl">(R. Shmuel bar Nachmani):</span> "I was a youth, I grew old" - this verse was said by the world minister (the angel Metatron).</p></div>
<div class="indent2"><span class="nm">1.</span><p>Hash-m could not have said it, for He does not age;</p></div>
<div class="indent2"><span class="nm">2.</span><p>David could not have said it, for he did not live to be so old!</p></div>
<div class="indent2"><span class="nm">3.</span><p>Rather, the world minister must have said it.</p></div>
<div class="indent1"><span class="nm">(b)</span><p><span class="cl">(R. Shmuel bar Nachmani):</span> "The afflicter spread his hand on all its treasures" refers to Amon and Mo'av;</p></div>
<div class="indent2"><span class="nm">1.</span><p>When Nochrim entered the Heichal, all others engaged in taking gold and silver, and they turned to the Sefer Torah.</p></div>
<div class="indent2"><span class="nm">2.</span><p>They said 'the Torah forbids (converts from) Amon and Mo'av to marry into the congregation of Hashem' - it will be burned!</p></div>
<div class="indent2"><span class="nm">3.</span><p><span class="cl">(Rav):</span> "Hash-m commanded that Yakov's enemies surround him" - such as Humniya (Yevanim), who harass Yisraelim in Fum Nahara.</p></div>
<div class="subject"><span class="nm">4)</span><p>SAFEK YISRAELIM</p></div>
<div class="indent1"><span class="nm">(a)</span><p><span class="cl">(Rav Yehudah):</span> If a Nochri was Mekadesh a Bas Yisrael, we are concerned for this. Perhaps he is (a Yisrael) from the 10 tribes.</p></div>
<div class="indent1"><span class="nm">(b)</span><p><span class="cl">Question:</span> We should assume that he is from the majority of people, who are not from the 10 Shevatim!</p></div>
<div class="indent1"><span class="nm">(c)</span><p><span class="cl">Answer:</span> We are concerned in places where they (the 10 Shevatim) settled. (Rashi - there they are 'fixed', so it is considered an even Safek. Tosfos - there, they are the majority.)</p></div>
