<p class="bas subject"><span class="nm">1)</span>WHY KUSIM MAY NOT MARRY ONE ANOTHER (cont.)</p>
<p class="bas indent1"><span class="nm">(a)</span><span class="cl">Question:</span> According to R. Akiva why was it forbidden to marry Kusim?</p>
<p class="bas indent1"><span class="nm">(b)</span><span class="cl">Answer:</span> They did Yibum only for a widow from Erusin. If she was widowed from Nisu'in, they exempted her from Yibum and Chalitzah.</p>
<p class="bas indent2"><span class="nm">1.</span><span class="cl">Question:</span> Why did they do so?</p>
<p class="bas indent2"><span class="nm">2.</span><span class="cl">Answer:</span> They expounded "the widow Chutzah (outside) will not be (married) to a stranger", but a widow who was inside, i.e. had Nisu'in, may marry a stranger.</p>
<p class="bas indent3"><span class="nm">i.</span>R. Akiva holds that Mamzerim result from Bi'ah of Chayavei Lavin (such as "the widow will not be (married) to a stranger").</p>
<p class="bas indent1"><span class="nm">(c)</span><span class="cl">Continuation of Answer #3 (Ravin):</span> Some say that Chachamim decreed not to marry Kusim because they are not proficient in the fine points of Mitzvos.</p>
<p class="bas indent2"><span class="nm">1.</span><span class="cl">Question:</span> Like whom is this opinion?</p>
<p class="bas indent2"><span class="nm">2.</span><span class="cl">Answer (Rav Idi bar Avin):</span> It is like R. Eliezer.</p>
<p class="bas indent3"><span class="nm">i.</span><span class="cl">(Beraisa):</span> The Matzah of Kusim is permitted. One who eats it on the first night of Pesach fulfils the Mitzvah;</p>
<p class="bas indent3"><span class="nm">ii.</span>R. Eliezer forbids it, because they are not fluent in the fine points of Mitzvos;</p>
<p class="bas indent3"><span class="nm">iii.</span>R. Shimon ben Gamliel says, the Mitzvos Kusim are established to keep, they are more meticulous in them than Yisrael.</p>
<p class="bas indent2"><span class="nm">3.</span><span class="cl">Question:</span> Why can we not marry Kusim, just because they are not fluent in the fine points of Mitzvos?</p>
<p class="bas indent2"><span class="nm">4.</span><span class="cl">Answer:</span> They err about Kidushin and divorce.</p>
<p class="bas indent1"><span class="nm">(d)</span><span class="cl">Answer #4 (Rav Nachman):</span> A Mamzer who resulting from siblings, and a Mamzer who resulted from a man who married his brother's wife, intermarried with the Kusim (so there are Mamzerim among them).</p>
<p class="bas indent2"><span class="nm">1.</span><span class="cl">Question:</span> Why did Rav Nachman need to say how they became Mamzerim?</p>
<p class="bas indent2"><span class="nm">2.</span><span class="cl">Answer:</span> He teaches that Chayavei Kerisus produce Mamzerim.</p>
<p class="bas indent2"><span class="nm">3.</span><span class="cl">Question:</span> Why did he need to give two examples?</p>
<p class="bas indent2"><span class="nm">4.</span><span class="cl">Answer:</span> The case was, two such Mamzerim intermarried with them.</p>
<p class="bas indent1"><span class="nm">(e)</span><span class="cl">Answer #5 (Rava):</span> A male slave and a female slave intermarried with the Kusim.</p>
<p class="bas indent2"><span class="nm">1.</span><span class="cl">Question:</span> The lineage problem is solely due to the female slave. Why did he mention the male slave?</p>
<p class="bas indent2"><span class="nm">2.</span><span class="cl">Answer:</span> He described the case like it was.</p>
<p class="bas subject"><span class="nm">2)</span>CHECKING FOR LINEAGE</p>
<p class="bas indent1"><span class="nm">(a)</span><span class="cl">(Mishnah):</span> If one wants to marry a Bas Kohen, he must check the lineage of four of her maternal ancestors, and also their mothers, making eight in all:</p>
<p class="bas indent2"><span class="nm">1.</span>Her mother; the mother of the father of her mother; her father's mother; the mother of her father's father; and the mothers of these four women.</p>
<p class="bas indent1"><span class="nm">(b)</span>If one wants to marry a Bas Levi or Bas Yisrael, he must check all these and an additional mother.</p>
<p class="bas indent1"><span class="nm">(c)</span>One need not check ancestors of one (a Kohen) who offered Kodshim on the Mizbe'ach, or one (a Levi) who sang on the Duchan in the Mikdash, or a one who was on the Sanhedrin;</p>
<p class="bas indent1"><span class="nm">(d)</span>If a woman's ancestors were judges or collectors of Tzedakah, a Kohen may marry her without checking them;</p>
<p class="bas indent1"><span class="nm">(e)</span>Rebbi Yosi says, even one who was listed among potential judges of Tzipori need not be checked.</p>
<p class="bas indent1"><span class="nm">(f)</span>R. Chanina ben Antigonus says, even one who was listed among the king's soldiers.</p>
<p class="bas indent1"><span class="nm">(g)</span><span class="cl">(Gemara) Question:</span> Why do we check only mothers, and not fathers?</p>
<p class="bas indent1"><span class="nm">(h)</span><span class="cl">Answer:</span> When women quarrel, they insult each other about immorality. Lineage problems are not exposed. When men quarrel, they insult each other with lineage problems. Any problems would be common knowledge.</p>
<p class="bas indent1"><span class="nm">(i)</span><span class="cl">Question:</span> Why does a woman not need to check the ancestors of the man she marries?</p>
<p class="bas indent1"><span class="nm">(j)</span><span class="cl">Answer:</span> This supports Rav, who said that women (Kohanos) are not forbidden to marry (Kohanim) Pesulim. (Rashi - therefore, Chachamim were lenient not to make them check for Mamzerus; Tosfos - the whole checking was due to (Isurei) Kehunah. Chachamim extended the enactment to all men. Since Kohanos need not worry about disqualified Kohanim, no woman need check.)</p>
<p class="bas indent1"><span class="nm">(k)</span><span class="cl">(Rav Ada bar Ahavah):</span> Checking the four mothers entails checking 12 women;</p>
<p class="bas indent1"><span class="nm">(l)</span><span class="cl">(Beraisa):</span> Checking the four mothers entails checking 16 women.</p>
<p class="bas indent1"><span class="nm">(m)</span><span class="cl">Question:</span> Granted, Rav Ada discusses a Bas Levi or Bas Yisrael. One mother is added to each of the four (that mother's grandmother);</p>
<p class="bas bbbline">76b----------------------------------------76b</p>
<p class="bas indent2"><span class="nm">1.</span>How does the Beraisa find 16?</p>
<p class="bas indent1"><span class="nm">(n)</span><span class="cl">Answer:</span> The Mishnah says 'we add an additional mother', i.e. an additional pair of mothers (that mother's grandmother and great grandmother).</p>
<p class="bas indent1"><span class="nm">(o)</span><span class="cl">(Rav Yehudah citing Rav):</span> Our Mishnah is like R. Meir, but Chachamim say that all families are assumed to be of proper lineage.</p>
<p class="bas indent1"><span class="nm">(p)</span><span class="cl">Version #1 - Question:</span> Rav Chama bar Gurya cited Rav to say that the Mishnah is only when someone claimed that there is a problem!</p>
<p class="bas indent1"><span class="nm">(q)</span><span class="cl">Answer:</span> The Amora'im argue about Rav's opinion.</p>
<p class="bas indent1"><span class="nm">(r)</span><span class="cl">Version #2 (Rav Chama bar Gurya citing Rav):</span> If someone claims that there is a problem, we must check her ancestors (even according to Chachamim).</p>
<p class="bas subject"><span class="nm">3)</span>PEOPLE WHO NEED NOT BE CHECKED</p>
<p class="bas indent1"><span class="nm">(a)</span><span class="cl">(Mishnah):</span> One need not check ancestors of one who offered Kodshim on the Mizbe'ach.</p>
<p class="bas indent2"><span class="nm">1.</span>This is because no Kohen can serve before he is checked.</p>
<p class="bas indent1"><span class="nm">(b)</span><span class="cl">(Mishnah):</span> Or one who sang on the Duchan in the Mikdash.</p>
<p class="bas indent2"><span class="nm">1.</span>The Sanhedrin would also check Leviyim before letting them on the Duchan.</p>
<p class="bas indent1"><span class="nm">(c)</span><span class="cl">(Mishnah):</span> Or one who was on the Sanhedrin.</p>
<p class="bas indent1"><span class="nm">(d)</span><span class="cl">(Rav Yosef):</span> Just like one must be clean of sin to sit on the Sanhedrin, he must be clean of any blemish (in lineage).</p>
<p class="bas indent1"><span class="nm">(e)</span><span class="cl">(Mereimar):</span> We learn from "my beloved, you are totally beautiful, there is no blemish in you."</p>
<p class="bas indent1"><span class="nm">(f)</span><span class="cl">Suggestion:</span> Perhaps that refers to physical blemishes!</p>
<p class="bas indent1"><span class="nm">(g)</span><span class="cl">Answer (R. Acha bar Yakov):</span> "(the Sanhedrin) will stand with you (Moshe)" - they must be like you, i.e. of good lineage.</p>
<p class="bas indent1"><span class="nm">(h)</span><span class="cl">Question:</span> Perhaps that was only in Moshe's day, so they would be fitting for the Divine Presence to rest on them!</p>
<p class="bas indent1"><span class="nm">(i)</span><span class="cl">Answer (Rav Nachman):</span> "(The judges of tens, fifties...) will bear with you" - they must be (of good lineage) like Moshe.</p>
<p class="bas indent1"><span class="nm">(j)</span><span class="cl">(Mishnah):</span> If a woman's ancestors were judges (a Kohen need not check).</p>
<p class="bas indent1"><span class="nm">(k)</span><span class="cl">Inference:</span> This implies that (all) judges must have proper lineage.</p>
<p class="bas indent1"><span class="nm">(l)</span><span class="cl">Contradiction (Mishnah):</span> Everyone is fit to judge monetary cases; not everyone is fit to judge capital cases.</p>
<p class="bas indent2"><span class="nm">1.</span><span class="cl">Question:</span> Whom does 'everyone' come to include?</p>
<p class="bas indent2"><span class="nm">2.</span><span class="cl">Answer (Rav Yehudah):</span> It includes a Mamzer.</p>
<p class="bas indent1"><span class="nm">(m)</span><span class="cl">Answer (Abaye):</span> The Mishnah discusses in Yerushalayim, where they would only appoint judges of good lineage.</p>
<p class="bas indent1"><span class="nm">(n)</span><span class="cl">(Mishnah):</span> Or collectors of Tzedakah.</p>
<p class="bas indent2"><span class="nm">1.</span>This is because they quarrel with people. We may take securities for money that people must give to Tzedakah, even on Erev Shabbos;</p>
<p class="bas indent2"><span class="nm">2.</span>If there were any lineage problems, they would be known.</p>
<p class="bas indent1"><span class="nm">(o)</span>Rav Ada bar Ahavah's innkeeper was a convert. He was fighting with Rav Bivi, for each wanted to be head of the city.</p>
<p class="bas indent2"><span class="nm">1.</span><span class="cl">(Rav Yosef):</span> "You will put on yourselves a king from amidst your brothers" - all appointments must be from your close brothers (this excludes converts).</p>
<p class="bas indent2"><span class="nm">2.</span><span class="cl">Question (Rav Ada bar Ahavah):</span> Does that even exclude a son of a convert and a Bas Yisrael?</p>
<p class="bas indent2"><span class="nm">3.</span><span class="cl">Rav Yosef:</span> No. Such a convert is considered your close brother. Therefore, Rav Bivi, a great Chacham, will govern spiritual affairs; and the innkeeper will direct municipal affairs.</p>
<p class="bas indent2"><span class="nm">4.</span><span class="cl">Abaye:</span> One who hosts Chachamim in his inn should host someone like Rav Ada bar Ahavah, who knows how to argue for his host.</p>
<p class="bas indent1"><span class="nm">(p)</span>Rav Zeira and Rabah bar Avuha would give authority to such converts.</p>
<p class="bas indent1"><span class="nm">(q)</span>In Eretz Yisrael, they would not be appointed even over the measures. In Neharda'a, they would not be appointed even over division of usage of wells.</p>
<p class="bas indent1"><span class="nm">(r)</span><span class="cl">(Mishnah - Rebbi Yosi):</span> Even one who was listed among potential judges of Tzipori need not be checked.</p>
<p class="bas indent2"><span class="nm">1.</span>This is because they would check someone before putting him on the list.</p>
<p class="bas subject"><span class="nm">4)</span>LINEAGE OF SOLDIERS</p>
<p class="bas indent1"><span class="nm">(a)</span><span class="cl">(Mishnah - R. Chanina ben Antigonus):</span> Even one who was listed among the king's soldiers.</p>
<p class="bas indent1"><span class="nm">(b)</span><span class="cl">(Rav Yehudah):</span> This refers to David's soldiers.</p>
<p class="bas indent2"><span class="nm">1.</span><span class="cl">(Rav Yosef):</span> We learn from "of known lineage in the army".</p>
<p class="bas indent1"><span class="nm">(c)</span><span class="cl">Question:</span> Why was David insistent that his soldiers have good lineage?</p>
<p class="bas indent1"><span class="nm">(d)</span><span class="cl">Answer:</span> It is so that their merit and their ancestors' merit will aid them.</p>
<p class="bas indent1"><span class="nm">(e)</span><span class="cl">Question:</span> Tzelek ha'Amoni was in David's army!</p>
<p class="bas indent2"><span class="nm">1.</span><span class="cl">Suggestion:</span> He was a convert from Amon!</p>
<p class="bas indent1"><span class="nm">(f)</span><span class="cl">Answer:</span> No, he (was a Ben Yisrael, and) merely lived in Amon.</p>
<p class="bas indent1"><span class="nm">(g)</span><span class="cl">Question:</span> Uriyah ha'Chiti was in David's army!</p>
<p class="bas indent2"><span class="nm">1.</span><span class="cl">Suggestion:</span> He was a convert from Ches!</p>
<p class="bas indent1"><span class="nm">(h)</span><span class="cl">Answer:</span> No, he (originally) lived in Ches.</p>
<p class="bas indent1"><span class="nm">(i)</span><span class="cl">Question #1:</span> Iti ha'Giti was in David's army!</p>
<p class="bas indent2"><span class="nm">1.</span><span class="cl">Suggestion:</span> Perhaps he merely lived in Gas.</p>
<p class="bas indent2"><span class="nm">2.</span><span class="cl">Rejection:</span> Rav Nachman taught that Iti ha'Giti was Mevatel (nullified) the idol of Amon (only a Nochri can Mevatel idolatry).</p>
<p class="bas indent1"><span class="nm">(j)</span><span class="cl">Question #2:</span> Rav Yehudah taught that David's army had 400 children from Yefos To'ar (beautiful Nochriyos taken in war). They would grow ponytails (like Nochrim) and ride in gold wagons at the head of the troops. They were the muscle of David's house.</p>
<p class="bas indent1"><span class="nm">(k)</span><span class="cl">Answer to both questions:</span> They were merely to scare the enemy (but they did not fight).</p>
