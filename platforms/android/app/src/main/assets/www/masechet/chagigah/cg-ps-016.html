<p class="bas indent1"><span class="nm">(c)</span>R. Akiva knew not to gaze at the place of the Shechinah, for he expounded the verses as such.</p>
<p class="bas subject"><span class="nm">2)</span>COMPARISIONS OF <i>SHEDIM</i>, <i>MALACHIM</i>, AND MEN</p>
<p class="bas indent1"><span class="nm">(a)</span><span class="cl">(Beraisa):</span> There are six characteristics of Shedim.</p>
<p class="bas indent2"><span class="nm">1.</span>In three they are like Malachei ha'Shares.</p>
<p class="bas indent3"><span class="nm">i.</span>They have wings.</p>
<p class="bas indent3"><span class="nm">ii.</span>They fly from one side of the world to the other.</p>
<p class="bas indent3"><span class="nm">iii.</span>They hear from behind the heavenly curtain what is going to occur in the future.</p>
<p class="bas indent2"><span class="nm">2.</span>In three they are like humans.</p>
<p class="bas indent3"><span class="nm">i.</span>They eat and drink.</p>
<p class="bas indent3"><span class="nm">ii.</span>They propagate.</p>
<p class="bas indent3"><span class="nm">iii.</span>They die.</p>

<p class="bas subject"><span class="nm">3)</span>ANYONE WHO LOOKS INTO ONE OF FOUR THINGS IS BETTER OFF HAVING NOT BEEN CREATED</p>
<p class="bas indent1"><span class="nm">(a)</span><span class="cl">Question:</span> What is wrong with inquiring what was before the world? What happened already is history!</p>
<p class="bas indent1"><span class="nm">(b)</span><span class="cl">Answer:</span> [Hash-m does not want people to conjecture what existed prior to the world, lest they imagine something disrespectful.] It is like a king who told his servants to build him a palace on a garbage dump; the king does not want people to mention the garbage dump.</p>
<p class="bas subject"><span class="nm">4)</span>ANYONE WHO DOES NOT HAVE COMPASSION FOR THE HONOR OF HIS CREATOR IS BETTER OFF HAVING NOT BEEN CREATED</p>
<p class="bas indent1"><span class="nm">(a)</span><span class="cl">(R. Aba):</span> This is one who gazes at a rainbow.</p>
<p class="bas indent1"><span class="nm">(b)</span><span class="cl">(R. Yosef):</span> This is one who commits a sin in private.</p>
<p class="bas indent2"><span class="nm">1.</span><span class="cl">Question:</span> But did R. Ila'a ha'Zaken not say that if a person's Yetzer ha'Ra is overcoming him, he should go to a place where no one recognizes him, dress in black, wrap himself in black, and then do what his heart desires, in order not to desecrate Hash-m's name in public!?</p>
<p class="bas indent2"><span class="nm">2.</span><span class="cl">Answer:</span> One case is when he can control his Yetzer, and one case is when he is unable to control it.</p>
<p class="bas subject"><span class="nm">5)</span>THREE THINGS THAT WEAKEN A PERSON'S EYESIGHT</p>
<p class="bas indent1"><span class="nm">(a)</span><span class="cl">(R. Yehudah b'R. Nachmeni):</span> The eyes are weakened of one who gazes at three things:</p>
<p class="bas indent2"><span class="nm">1.</span>A rainbow (based on Yechezkel 1:28)</p>
<p class="bas indent2"><span class="nm">2.</span>The Nasi (based on Bamidbar 27:20)</p>
<p class="bas indent2"><span class="nm">3.</span>The Kohanim, during the times of the Beis ha'Mikdash, when they stand and bless the people with the Ineffable Name.</p>
<p class="bas subject"><span class="nm">6)</span>THE WITNESSES OF MAN'S SINS</p>
<p class="bas indent1"><span class="nm">(a)</span><span class="cl">(R. Yehudah b'R. Nachmeni):</span> To what does the verse, "Do not believe the friend, do not trust the leader" (Michah 7:5), refer?</p>
<p class="bas indent2"><span class="nm">1.</span>"The friend" is the Yetzer ha'Ra (based on Bereishis 8:21), and "the Leader" is Hash-m (based on Yirmiyahu 3:4).</p>
<p class="bas indent2"><span class="nm">2.</span>If the Yetzer ha'Ra ("the friend") tells you to sin and that Hash-m ("the Leader") will pardon you, "do not believe 'the friend'!"</p>
<p class="bas indent1"><span class="nm">(b)</span>Who will testify that a person sinned?</p>
<p class="bas indent2"><span class="nm">1.</span>The stones and pillars of his house (Chabakuk 2:11).</p>
<p class="bas indent2"><span class="nm">2.</span>A person's Neshamah (Michah 7:5).</p>
<p class="bas indent2"><span class="nm">3.</span>The two Malachei ha'Shares that accompany a person (Tehilim 91:11).</p>
<p class="bas indent2"><span class="nm">4.</span>A person's limbs (Yeshayah 43:12).</p>
<p class="bas subject"><span class="nm">7)</span><i>MISHNAH</i>: THE DEBATE ABOUT <i>SEMICHAH</i></p>
<p class="bas indent1"><span class="nm">(a)</span>Five pairs of early Tana'im argue whether Semichah may be performed on Yom Tov.</p>
<p class="bas bbbline">16b----------------------------------------16b</p>
<p class="bas indent1"><span class="nm">(b)</span>The first Tana of each pair was the Nasi, and the second Tana of each pair was the Av Beis Din.</p>
<p class="bas indent1"><span class="nm">(c)</span><span class="cl">(Gemara):</span> The Chachamim and R. Meir argue whether R. Yehudah ben Tabai was a Nasi or an Av Beis Din.</p>
<p class="bas subject"><span class="nm">8)</span>DO NOT TAKE <i>SHEVUS</i> LIGHTLY</p>
<p class="bas indent1"><span class="nm">(a)</span><span class="cl">(R. Yochanan):</span> Do not take "Shevus" lightly, for "Semichah" is only Shevus and yet the greatest of each generation argued about it.</p>
<p class="bas indent1"><span class="nm">(b)</span><span class="cl">Question:</span> But that is obvious [that it is not to be taken lightly]!</p>
<p class="bas indent1"><span class="nm">(c)</span><span class="cl">Answer:</span> R. Yochanan is coming to exclude the opinion that claims that the early generations argued not about whether Semichah may be done on Yom Tov, but whether Semichah is done <i>at all</i> on Korbanos of Shalmei Chovah.</p>
<p class="bas indent1"><span class="nm">(d)</span><span class="cl">(Rami bar Chama):</span> We hear from here that Semichah must be done with all of one's strength, because if not, what Shevus is involved?</p>
<p class="bas indent1"><span class="nm">(e)</span><span class="cl">(R. Papa):</span> We hear from here that the Isur of Shevus includes leaning on the side of an animal.</p>
<p class="bas indent2"><span class="nm">1.</span>If the sides were permitted, then let one do Semichah on the sides of the animal (on Yom Tov)!</p>
<p class="bas indent2"><span class="nm">2.</span><span class="cl">(R. Ashi):</span> Perhaps leaning on the sides is permitted, but anything which is on the same level as the back of the animal is like the back of the animal.</p>
