<p class="bas subject"><span class="nm">1)</span>MAY A WOMAN TEAR HER HAIR? (cont.)</p>
<p class="bas indent1"><span class="nm">(a)</span><span class="cl">Answer #2 (to Question 4:d, 35b - Abaye):</span> Isi learns a Gezeirah Shavah "Karachah-Karachah" from the Isur for Kohanim to tear hair.</p>
<p class="bas indent2"><span class="nm">1.</span>Just like that does not apply to women (it says "Bnei Aharon"), also the Isur of Yisre'elim to tear hair.</p>
<p class="bas indent1"><span class="nm">(b)</span><span class="cl">Question:</span> If "Bnei Aharon" applies also to tearing hair (to exclude Kohanos), there is no need for the Gezeirah Shavah!</p>
<p class="bas indent2"><span class="nm">1.</span>The Torah gave extra Mitzvos to Kohanim, yet female Kohanim are not forbidden to tear hair - all the more so, the Isur for Yisre'elim to tear hair does not apply to women!</p>
<p class="bas indent1"><span class="nm">(c)</span><span class="cl">Answer:</span> We would have said that "Bnei Aharon" does not apply to tearing hair, for there is an interruption. We know that this is not so only due to the Gezeirah Shavah. (If Kohanos were forbidden to tear hair, the Gezeirah Shavah would not teach anything!)</p>
<p class="bas indent1"><span class="nm">(d)</span><span class="cl">Question:</span> The Gezeirah Shavah could teach like the following Beraisa! ("Bnei Aharon" would not apply to tearing hair.)</p>
<p class="bas indent2"><span class="nm">1.</span><span class="cl">(Beraisa) Suggestion:</span> Perhaps one who tears four or five bald spots at the same time is liable only once for "they will not uproot hair"!</p>
<p class="bas indent2"><span class="nm">2.</span><span class="cl">Rejection:</span> "A bald spot" is extra to obligate for each one.</p>
<p class="bas indent2"><span class="nm">3.</span><span class="cl">Question:</span> What do we learn from "in their heads"?</p>
<p class="bas indent2"><span class="nm">4.</span><span class="cl">Answer:</span> This teaches that the Isur applies to the whole head, not only "between the eyes".</p>
<p class="bas indent2"><span class="nm">5.</span><span class="cl">Question:</span> These two stringencies were taught regarding Kohanim (to whom the Torah gave extra Mitzvos). What is the source that they apply to also to Yisre'elim?</p>
<p class="bas indent2"><span class="nm">6.</span><span class="cl">Answer:</span> A Gezeirah Shavah "Karachah-Karachah" teaches that also Yisre'elim are liable for each tearing, and on the entire head;</p>
<p class="bas indent3"><span class="nm">i.</span>Also, just like Yisre'elim are forbidden to tear only due to a Mes, also Kohanim.</p>
<p class="bas indent1"><span class="nm">(e)</span><span class="cl">Answer:</span> If the Torah wanted only to teach the Gezeirah Shavah, it should have written "Karach". Rather, it wrote "Karachah" to teach also that it applies to women.</p>
<p class="bas indent1"><span class="nm">(f)</span><span class="cl">Answer #3 (Rava):</span> Isi learns a Gezeirah Shavah "Bein Eineichem" from Tefilin;</p>
<p class="bas indent2"><span class="nm">1.</span>Just like women are exempt from Tefilin, also from tearing hear.</p>
<p class="bas indent1"><span class="nm">(g)</span><span class="cl">Question:</span> Why didn't Rava learn as Abaye?</p>
<p class="bas indent1"><span class="nm">(h)</span><span class="cl">Answer:</span> He holds that we do not expound the difference between "Karach" and "Karachah".</p>
<p class="bas indent1"><span class="nm">(i)</span><span class="cl">Question:</span> Why didn't Abaye learn like Rava?</p>
<p class="bas indent1"><span class="nm">(j)</span><span class="cl">Answer:</span> He holds that the Gezeirah Shavah teaches only that we wear Tefilin (on the head) only in a place where the Isur to tear hair applies, i.e. where hair grows.</p>
<p class="bas subject"><span class="nm">2)</span>CHILDREN TO HASH-M</p>
<p class="bas indent1"><span class="nm">(a)</span><span class="cl">Question:</span> What do Abaye and Rava learn from "you are children (to Hash-m)"?</p>
<p class="bas indent1"><span class="nm">(b)</span><span class="cl">Answer (Beraisa - Rebbi Yehudah):</span> "You are children to Hash-m" - you are called children only when you act like (His) children;</p>
<p class="bas indent2"><span class="nm">1.</span>R. Meir says, in either case you are called children - "they are foolish children", "children, they are not trustworthy", "evil seed, children that act corruptly", "instead of saying 'you are not My nation', they will say 'children of the living G-d'".</p>
<p class="bas indent2"><span class="nm">2.</span><span class="cl">Question:</span> Why didn't the first verse suffice?</p>
<p class="bas indent2"><span class="nm">3.</span><span class="cl">Answer:</span> One might have thought that they are called children when foolish, but not when they cannot be trusted. Therefore, the second verse is needed;</p>
<p class="bas indent2"><span class="nm">4.</span>One might have thought that they are called children when they cannot be trusted, but not when they serve idolatry. Therefore, the third verse is needed;</p>
<p class="bas indent2"><span class="nm">5.</span>One might have thought that such children are called children, but they are not called proper children (even after they repent). Therefore, the last verse is needed.</p>
<p class="bas subject"><span class="nm">3)</span>WOMEN MAY NOT SERVE IN THE MIKDASH</p>
<p class="bas indent1"><span class="nm">(a)</span><span class="cl">(Mishnah):</span> Only men may do the following Avodos: Semichah (pressing on a Korban's neck), waving, Hagashah (bringing close to the Mizbe'ach), Kemitzah (talking a handful of a Minchah, i.e. a Korban made from flour), burning on the Mizbe'ach, Melikah (cutting the neck of a bird with one's fingernail), Kabalah (catching the blood of slaughter in a Kli), and sprinkling;</p>
<p class="bas indent2"><span class="nm">1.</span>The only exceptions are a Sotah and a Nezirah, who wave their offerings.</p>
<p class="bas indent1"><span class="nm">(b)</span><span class="cl">(Gemara):</span> We learn Semichah from "Bnei Yisrael (not Benos Yisrael)... v'Samach."</p>
<p class="bas indent1"><span class="nm">(c)</span>We learn waving from "Bnei Yisrael... he will wave."</p>
<p class="bas indent1"><span class="nm">(d)</span>We learn Hagashah from "Bnei Aharon will bring close".</p>
<p class="bas indent1"><span class="nm">(e)</span>We learn Kemitzah from "he will bring it to Bnei Aharon, and he will take a handful".</p>
<p class="bas indent1"><span class="nm">(f)</span>We learn burning from "Bnei Aharon will burn it".</p>
<p class="bas indent1"><span class="nm">(g)</span>The Torah equates Melikah to burning.</p>
<p class="bas indent1"><span class="nm">(h)</span>We learn Kabalah from "Bnei Aharon will offer";</p>
<p class="bas bbbline">36b----------------------------------------36b</p>
<p class="bas indent2"><span class="nm">1.</span>In this verse, "will offer" refers to Kabalah.</p>
<p class="bas indent1"><span class="nm">(i)</span><span class="cl">(Mishnah):</span> (Only men may) sprinkle.</p>
<p class="bas indent1"><span class="nm">(j)</span><span class="cl">Question:</span> To which sprinkling does this refer?</p>
<p class="bas indent2"><span class="nm">1.</span><span class="cl">Suggestion:</span> It refers to sprinkling blood of the red heifer.</p>
<p class="bas indent2"><span class="nm">2.</span><span class="cl">Rejection:</span> It says "Elazar" (we require the Sgan, the Kohen ready to substitute for the Kohen Gadol if necessary)!</p>
<p class="bas indent2"><span class="nm">3.</span><span class="cl">Suggestion:</span> It refers to sprinkling blood in the Kodesh ha'Kodoshim.</p>
<p class="bas indent2"><span class="nm">4.</span><span class="cl">Rejection:</span> It says "the anointed Kohen (Gadol)"!</p>
<p class="bas indent1"><span class="nm">(k)</span><span class="cl">Answer:</span> It refers to sprinkling a bird's blood. We learn this from a Kal va'Chomer:</p>
<p class="bas indent2"><span class="nm">1.</span>Even a Zar (non-Kohen) may slaughter an animal Korban, but a Kohen must sprinkle its blood. Only a Kohen may do Melikah of a bird, all the more so a Kohen must sprinkle the blood!</p>
<p class="bas indent1"><span class="nm">(l)</span><span class="cl">(Mishnah):</span> The only exceptions are a Sotah and a Nezirah (they wave their offerings).</p>
<p class="bas indent1"><span class="nm">(m)</span><span class="cl">Question (R. Elazar):</span> What is the source that the Minchah of a Sotah must be waved?</p>
<p class="bas indent2"><span class="nm">1.</span><span class="cl">Question:</span> A verse specifically says so!</p>
<p class="bas indent2"><span class="nm">2.</span><span class="cl">Answer:</span> He means, 'What is the source that the one who brings it must wave it?'</p>
<p class="bas indent1"><span class="nm">(n)</span><span class="cl">Answer:</span> He learns a Gezeirah Shavah "Yad-Yad" from Shelamim.</p>
<p class="bas indent2"><span class="nm">1.</span>It says "the Kohen will take from the woman's (Sotah's) Yad" and "Yadav will wave (the Shelamim)." Just like the Kohen waves a Sotah's offering, he waves also a Shelamim;</p>
<p class="bas indent2"><span class="nm">2.</span>Just like one who brings a Shelamim waves it, also a Sotah waves her Minchah.</p>
<p class="bas indent2"><span class="nm">3.</span><span class="cl">Question:</span> How do we fulfill both!</p>
<p class="bas indent2"><span class="nm">4.</span><span class="cl">Answer:</span> The Kohen puts his hands under the owner's hands, and they wave together.</p>
<p class="bas indent1"><span class="nm">(o)</span>We learn Nezirah from Sotah through a Gezeirah Shavah "Kaf-Kaf".</p>
<p class="bas subject"><span class="nm">4)</span>WHICH MITZVOS APPLY ONLY IN ERETZ YISRAEL?</p>
<p class="bas indent1"><span class="nm">(a)</span><span class="cl">(Mishnah):</span> Any Mitzvah that is dependent on the land applies only in Eretz Yisrael;</p>
<p class="bas indent1"><span class="nm">(b)</span>Any Mitzvah that is not dependent on land applies also in Chutz La'Aretz, except for Orlah (the Isur to eat fruits of the first three years of a tree) and Kilayim (mixed seeds);</p>
