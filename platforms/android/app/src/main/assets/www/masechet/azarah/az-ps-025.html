<p class="bas indent1"><span class="nm">(a)</span><span class="cl">Question:</span> "... Hi Kesuvah Al Sefer ha'Yashar" - what is Sefer ha'Yashar?</p>
<p class="bas indent1"><span class="nm">(b)</span><span class="cl">Answer (R. Chiya bar Aba):</span> It is Bereishis, which discusses Avraham, Yitzchak and Yakov;</p>
<p class="bas indent2"><span class="nm">1.</span>They are called Yesharim (straight) - "Tamos Nafshi Mos Yesharim."</p>
<p class="bas indent1"><span class="nm">(c)</span><span class="cl">Question:</span> Where in Sefer Bereishis does it allude to this miracle?</p>
<p class="bas indent1"><span class="nm">(d)</span><span class="cl">Answer:</span> "V'Zar'o (of Efrayim) Yihyeh Melo ha'Goyim."</p>
<p class="bas indent1"><span class="nm">(e)</span><span class="cl">Version #1 - Question:</span> "Va'Ya'amod ha'Shemesh ba'Chatzi ha'Shamayaim v'Lo Atz Lavo k'Yom Tamim" - how long was it until it set?</p>
<p class="bas indent1"><span class="nm">(f)</span><span class="cl">Answer #1 (R. Yehoshua ben Levi):</span> It shone for 24 hours, a full day. It ascended six hours (like usual), stood still (in the middle of the sky) for six hours, descended six hours, and stood still (just before setting) for six hours;</p>
<p class="bas indent1"><span class="nm">(g)</span><span class="cl">Answer #2 (R. Elazar):</span> It shone for 36 hours. It ascended six, stood still for 12, descended six, and stood still for 12;</p>
<p class="bas indent2"><span class="nm">1.</span>It stood still for a full day.</p>
<p class="bas indent1"><span class="nm">(h)</span><span class="cl">Answer #3 (R. Shmuel bar Nachmani):</span> It shone for 48 hours. It ascended six, stood still for 12, descended six, and stood still for 24 - "v'Lo Atz Lavo k'Yom Tamim."</p>
<p class="bas indent2"><span class="nm">1.</span>This implies that (only before setting, it delayed a full day, but) the first time it stopped was less than a full day.</p>
<p class="bas indent1"><span class="nm">(i)</span><span class="cl">Version #2:</span> The above opinions (24, 36 and 48) are how long it stopped.</p>
<p class="bas indent1"><span class="nm">(j)</span><span class="cl">(R. Yehoshua ben Levi):</span> It stopped for 24 hours that day. It ascended six, stood still for 12, descended six, and stood still for 12;</p>
<p class="bas indent2"><span class="nm">1.</span>It stood still for a full day.</p>
<p class="bas indent1"><span class="nm">(k)</span><span class="cl">(R. Elazar):</span> It stopped for 36 hours. It ascended six, stood still for 12, descended six, and stood still for 24;</p>

<p class="bas indent1"><span class="nm">(l)</span><span class="cl">(R. Shmuel bar Nachmani):</span> It stopped for 48 hours. It ascended six, stood still for 24, descended six, and stood still for 24;</p>
<p class="bas indent2"><span class="nm">1.</span>The verse equates its standing (in mid-sky) to the delay before setting. Just like the latter was a full day, also the former.</p>
<p class="bas indent1"><span class="nm">(m)</span><span class="cl">(Beraisa):</span> Just like the sun stopped for Yehoshua, it also stopped for Moshe and Nakdimon ben Guryon.</p>
<p class="bas indent2"><span class="nm">1.</span>The above verses teach about Yehoshua. We have a tradition about Nakdimon ben Guryon;</p>
<p class="bas indent1"><span class="nm">(n)</span><span class="cl">Question:</span> What is the source for Moshe?</p>
<p class="bas indent1"><span class="nm">(o)</span><span class="cl">Answer #1:</span> We learn from a Gezerah Shavah "Achel-Achel":</p>
<p class="bas indent2"><span class="nm">1.</span>It says regarding Moshe "Achel Tes Pachdecha" like it says regarding Yehoshua "Achel Gadlecha."</p>
<p class="bas indent1"><span class="nm">(p)</span><span class="cl">Answer #2 (R. Yochanan):</span> We learn from a Gezerah Shavah "Tes-Tes":</p>
<p class="bas indent2"><span class="nm">1.</span>It says regarding Moshe "Achel Tes Pachdecha" like it says regarding Yehoshua "b'Yom Tes Hash-m..."</p>
<p class="bas indent1"><span class="nm">(q)</span><span class="cl">Answer #3 (Rav Shmuel bar Nachmani):</span> We learn directly from a verse "v'Ragzu v'Chalu Mipanecha."</p>
<p class="bas indent2"><span class="nm">1.</span>They feared Moshe when he stopped the sun.</p>
<p class="bas indent1"><span class="nm">(r)</span><span class="cl">Question:</span> "V'Lo Hayah ka'Yom ha'Zeh (when Yehoshua stopped the sun) Lefanav v'Acharav"!</p>
<p class="bas indent1"><span class="nm">(s)</span><span class="cl">Answer #1:</span> Moshe did not stop the sun for as long as Yehoshua did.</p>
<p class="bas indent1"><span class="nm">(t)</span><span class="cl">Answer #2:</span> Rocks did not fall from the sky for Moshe like they did for Yehoshua - "Avanim Gedolos Min ha'Shamayim."</p>

<p class="bas indent1"><span class="nm">(d)</span><span class="cl">Rejection:</span> This is forbidden even regarding immoral Yisraelim!</p>
<p class="bas indent2"><span class="nm">1.</span><span class="cl">(Mishnah):</span> A woman may be secluded with two men (Yisraelim);</p>
<p class="bas indent2"><span class="nm">2.</span><span class="cl">(Rav Yehudah):</span> This refers to Kesherim, but she may not be secluded with 10 immoral men.</p>
<p class="bas indent3"><span class="nm">i.</span>A case occurred in which 10 men carried out a married woman in a coffin and sinned with her.</p>
<p class="bas indent1"><span class="nm">(e)</span><span class="cl">Answer #2:</span> The Mishnah forbids seclusion with a Nochri, even if his wife is there.</p>
<p class="bas indent2"><span class="nm">1.</span>A Nochri's wife will not stop him from sinning, but a Yisraelis guards her husband.</p>
<p class="bas indent1"><span class="nm">(f)</span><span class="cl">Question:</span> Even without concern for relations, one may not be secluded with Nochrim, for they kill people!</p>
<p class="bas indent1"><span class="nm">(g)</span><span class="cl">Answer #1 (R. Yirmeyah):</span> The Mishnah forbids even an important woman (she has connections to the king). They are afraid to kill her.</p>
<p class="bas indent1"><span class="nm">(h)</span><span class="cl">Answer #2 (Rav Idi):</span> A woman is not in danger of being killed (Rashi - he would rather have relations with her, and then he would not kill her; Tosfos - since women do not fight, people have mercy on her).</p>
<p class="bas indent1"><span class="nm">(i)</span><span class="cl">Question:</span> What is the difference between these answers?</p>
<p class="bas indent1"><span class="nm">(j)</span><span class="cl">Version #1 (Rashi) Answer:</span> They argue about an important woman who is not attractive. (All agree that he will not kill her. R. Yirmeyah permits seclusion. We are not concerned for relations, since she is not attractive. Rav Idi is always concerned for relations.)</p>
<p class="bas indent1"><span class="nm">(k)</span><span class="cl">Version #2 (Tosfos) Answer #1:</span> They argue about an important woman secluded with (male) Nochrim. (All agree that he will not kill her; R. Yirmeyah forbids seclusion, we are concerned for relations; Rav Idi says that they fear even to have relations with her.)</p>
<p class="bas indent1"><span class="nm">(l)</span><span class="cl">Answer #2:</span> They argue about an unimportant woman secluded with Nochriyos. (R. Yirmeyah forbids seclusion, lest they kill her; Rav Idi is never concerned for this.) (end of Version #2)</p>
<p class="bas indent1"><span class="nm">(m)</span><span class="cl">Support (for Rav Idi - Beraisa):</span> Even though a woman is never in danger of being killed, she may not be secluded with Nochrim, for they are suspected of immorality.</p>
<p class="bas subject"><span class="nm">4)</span>DEFENDING ONESELF FROM NOCHRIM</p>
<p class="bas indent1"><span class="nm">(a)</span><span class="cl">(Beraisa):</span> If a Yisrael is walking in the same direction as a Nochri, he should ensure that the Nochri is to his right;</p>
<p class="bas indent1"><span class="nm">(b)</span>R. Yishmael son of R. Yochanan ben Brokah says, that is when the Nochri has a sword (on his left thigh. If the Nochri draws it, the Yisrael will be in position to grab it);</p>
<p class="bas indent2"><span class="nm">1.</span>If the Nochri has a stick (in his right hand); the Yisrael should be on the right side. (If the Nochri prepares to hit him, the Yisrael will be in position to grab it).</p>
<p class="bas indent1"><span class="nm">(c)</span>If they are ascending or descending, the Yisrael should be on top;</p>
<p class="bas indent1"><span class="nm">(d)</span>The Yisrael should not bend down (e.g. to pick up something), lest the Nochri smash his head.</p>
<p class="bas indent1"><span class="nm">(e)</span>If the Nochri asks the Yisrael's destination, he should lie, and mention a place further than his true destination, like Yakov did. (The Nochri will be patient and wait for a great opportunity to harm him.)</p>
<p class="bas indent2"><span class="nm">1.</span>He told Esav "Avo El Adoni Se'irah." Really, "v'Yakov Nasa Sukosah."</p>
<p class="bas indent2"><span class="nm">2.</span>Once, bandits came upon Talmidim of R. Akiva. The Talmidim said 'we are heading to Ako.' When they reached Keziv (their true destination), the bandits realized that they were tricked;</p>
<p class="bas indent3"><span class="nm">i.</span>The bandits remarked that R. Akiva's Talmidim were never harmed.</p>
