<p class="bas subject"><span class="nm">1)</span>PARDONING A SOLD DEBT (cont.)</p>
<p class="bas indent1"><span class="nm">(a)</span>The daughter heard the counsel, and pardoned the Kesuvah.</p>
<p class="bas indent2"><span class="nm">1.</span><span class="cl">Rav Nachman:</span> I acted like a lawyer (and I regret this).</p>
<p class="bas indent1"><span class="nm">(b)</span><span class="cl">Question:</span> Why did he originally give the counsel, and later regret it?</p>
<p class="bas indent1"><span class="nm">(c)</span><span class="cl">Answer:</span> Originally, he applied "Do not neglect your flesh." Later, he felt that an important person should refrain in such a case (lest others do so even for strangers).</p>
<p class="bas indent1"><span class="nm">(d)</span><span class="cl">(Shmuel):</span> One who sells a loan document can pardon the debt. Even his heir can pardon it.</p>
<p class="bas indent1"><span class="nm">(e)</span><span class="cl">(Rav Huna brei d'Rav Yehoshua):</span> If the buyer is clever, he will offer money to the borrower to write a loan document obligating himself to the buyer.</p>
<p class="bas indent1"><span class="nm">(f)</span><span class="cl">(Ameimar):</span> According to the opinion that one must pay for Garmi (indirect damage), one who pardons a sold debt must pay the full value of the document;</p>
<p class="bas indent2"><span class="nm">1.</span>The opinion that exempts for Garmi says that the buyer bought a mere piece of paper.</p>
<p class="bas indent1"><span class="nm">(g)</span>A case occurred, and Rafram overwhelmed Rav Ashi (with proofs), and Rav Ashi obligated the person to pay the full value.</p>
<p class="bas subject"><span class="nm">2)</span>HOW WE FORCE PEOPLE TO PAY DEBTS</p>
<p class="bas indent1"><span class="nm">(a)</span><span class="cl">(Ameimar):</span> If a man must pay a creditor and a Kesuvah, and he has land and money, each receives according to his law: the creditor gets money, and his ex-wife gets land. (The case is, the dates of the loan document and the Kesuvah are the same.)</p>
<p class="bas indent1"><span class="nm">(b)</span>If there is only land, it is given to the creditor.</p>
<p class="bas indent1"><span class="nm">(c)</span><span class="cl">Question:</span> What is the reason?</p>
<p class="bas indent1"><span class="nm">(d)</span><span class="cl">Answer:</span> A woman wants to get married more than a man does (so she will not refrain even if she has poor rights of collection. People might refuse to lend if they have poor collection rights.)</p>
<p class="bas indent1"><span class="nm">(e)</span><span class="cl">Rav Papa (to Rav Chama):</span> Did you cite Rava to say that if a creditor demands to be paid money and the borrower only has land, that we force him to sell his land?</p>
<p class="bas indent1"><span class="nm">(f)</span><span class="cl">Rav Chama:</span> No.</p>
<p class="bas indent1"><span class="nm">(g)</span><span class="cl">Rav Papa:</span> What was the case?</p>
<p class="bas indent1"><span class="nm">(h)</span><span class="cl">Rav Chama:</span> The borrower (falsely) claimed that the money in his possession belongs to a Nochri. Since he acted improperly, we treated him improperly, and forced him to sell his land.</p>
<p class="bas indent1"><span class="nm">(i)</span><span class="cl">Question (Rav Kahana, to Rav Papa):</span> You hold that it is a Mitzvah to pay a debt. If the borrower says 'I do not want to do the Mitzvah', what happens?</p>
<p class="bas indent1"><span class="nm">(j)</span><span class="cl">Answer (Rav Papa - Beraisa):</span> Forty lashes apply to Chayavei Lavin; but if someone refuses to do a Mitzvas Aseh, e.g. to make a Sukah or take a Lulav, we lash him until he fulfills it or until he dies.</p>

<p class="bas subject"><span class="nm">3)</span>A <i>GET</i> LEFT ON THE SIDE OF A <i>RESHUS</i> <i>HA'RABIM</i></p>
<p class="bas indent1"><span class="nm">(a)</span><span class="cl">Question (Rami bar Chama):</span> If her husband gave her Get and said 'you are not divorced until 30 days from now' and she left the Get on the side of a Reshus ha'Rabim (near the wall, where most people do not walk. If the Get was still there at the end of 30 days), what is the law?</p>
<p class="bas indent1"><span class="nm">(b)</span><span class="cl">Version #1 - Answer #1 (Rav Chisda):</span> We learn from Rav and Shmuel that she is not divorced (because it is not considered her Reshus. A Get must be put "b'Yadah", into her hand or Reshus).</p>
<p class="bas indent2"><span class="nm">1.</span><span class="cl">(Rav and Shmuel):</span> Seizure of orphans' property helps only if the property is in a Reshus ha'Rabim.</p>
<p class="bas indent2"><span class="nm">2.</span>The side of a Reshus ha'Rabim is like a Reshus ha'Rabim.</p>
<p class="bas indent1"><span class="nm">(c)</span><span class="cl">Answer #2:</span> Just the contrary, we learn from Rav Nachman that she is divorced!</p>
<p class="bas indent2"><span class="nm">1.</span><span class="cl">(Rav Nachman):</span> If Reuven told Shimon 'be Moshech this cow, but it is not yours until 30 days', he acquires it then, even if it is in a swamp.</p>
<p class="bas indent2"><span class="nm">2.</span><span class="cl">Suggestion:</span> A swamp is like the side of a Reshus ha'Rabim.</p>
<p class="bas indent1"><span class="nm">(d)</span><span class="cl">Rejection:</span> No, a swamp is different.</p>
<p class="bas indent1"><span class="nm">(e)</span><span class="cl">Version #2 - Answer #1 (Rav Chisda):</span> We learn from Rav Nachman that she is divorced;</p>
<p class="bas indent2"><span class="nm">1.</span>A swamp is like the side of Reshus ha'Rabim.</p>
<p class="bas indent1"><span class="nm">(f)</span><span class="cl">Answer #2:</span> Just the contrary, we learn from Rav and Shmuel that she is not divorced!</p>
<p class="bas indent2"><span class="nm">1.</span><span class="cl">Suggestion:</span> The side of a Reshus ha'Rabim is like a Reshus ha'Rabim.</p>
<p class="bas indent1"><span class="nm">(g)</span><span class="cl">Rejection:</span> No, they are different.</p>
<p class="bas subject"><span class="nm">4)</span>CAN ONE MAKE HIS WIFE SWEAR?</p>
<p class="bas indent1"><span class="nm">(a)</span><span class="cl">(Mishnah):</span> If one appointed his wife to sell his produce or oversee his affairs, he can make her swear (that she did not embezzle money) whenever he wants;</p>
<p class="bas indent1"><span class="nm">(b)</span>R. Eliezer says, he can make her swear even about the thread she spins or the dough she bakes.</p>
<p class="bas indent1"><span class="nm">(c)</span><span class="cl">(Gemara) Question:</span> Does R. Eliezer say that he can make her swear only through Gilgul (if she must swear about something else, she must include in the oath about the thread or dough)?</p>
<p class="bas indent2"><span class="nm">1.</span>Or, can he make her swear about these by themselves?</p>
<p class="bas indent1"><span class="nm">(d)</span><span class="cl">Answer #1 (Beraisa - Chachamim (to R. Eliezer)):</span> A person cannot live with a snake in a basket.</p>
<p class="bas indent2"><span class="nm">1.</span><span class="cl">Question:</span> Granted, if he can make her swear on these alone, this is intolerable.</p>
<p class="bas indent2"><span class="nm">2.</span>But if he can only make her include these when swearing about other things, what difference does it make to her?</p>
<p class="bas indent1"><span class="nm">(e)</span><span class="cl">Rejection:</span> Still, she can say that she cannot live with someone who is so exacting with her.</p>
<p class="bas indent1"><span class="nm">(f)</span><span class="cl">Answer #2 (Beraisa):</span> If a man did not exempt his wife from vows and oaths and appointed her to sell his produce or oversee his affairs, he can make her swear whenever he wants;</p>
<p class="bas indent2"><span class="nm">1.</span>If he did not appoint her to sell or oversee matters, he cannot impose an oath on her;</p>
<p class="bas indent2"><span class="nm">2.</span>R. Eliezer says, even if he did not appoint her to sell or oversee matters, he can make her swear whenever he wants, since every woman is sometimes like an overseer over her thread and dough.</p>
<p class="bas indent2"><span class="nm">3.</span><span class="cl">Chachamim:</span> A person cannot live with a snake in a basket.</p>
<p class="bas indent3"><span class="nm">i.</span>This shows that R. Eliezer says that he can make her swear about these alone.</p>
<p class="bas indent1"><span class="nm">(g)</span><span class="cl">(Mishnah):</span> If a man wrote to his wife 'I have no vow or oath against you', he cannot make her swear, but he can impose an oath on her heirs or someone who bought her Kesuvah (when they come to collect her Kesuvah after she was divorced and (regarding heirs) died).</p>
<p class="bas indent1"><span class="nm">(h)</span>If he wrote 'I have no vow or oath against you, your heirs, or one who buys your Kesuvah', he cannot impose an oath on her, her heirs, or one who bought her Kesuvah; but his heirs can impose an oath on them.</p>
<p class="bas indent1"><span class="nm">(i)</span>If he wrote 'I, my heirs, or one who buys my property have no vow or oath against you, your heirs, or one who buys your Kesuvah', this takes effect.</p>
<p class="bas indent1"><span class="nm">(j)</span>If she went from burying her husband to her father's house, or returned to her father-in-law's house, and did not become an overseer, the heirs cannot make her swear.</p>
<p class="bas indent1"><span class="nm">(k)</span>If she became an overseer, the heirs can make her swear about the future (after he died), but not about the past (in his lifetime).</p>
