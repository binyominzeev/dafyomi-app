<p class="dedicationbox">CHULIN 31-43 - Two weeks of study material have been dedicated by Mrs. Estanne Abraham Fawer to honor the Yahrzeit of her father, Rav Mordechai ben Eliezer Zvi (Rabbi Morton Weiner) Z'L, who passed away on 18 Teves 5760. May the merit of supporting and advancing Dafyomi study -- which was so important to him -- during the weeks of his Yahrzeit serve as an Iluy for his Neshamah. </p>

<div class="subject"><span class="nm">1)</span><p>DEFECTS THAT MAKE AN ANIMAL TEREIFAH</p></div>
<div class="indent1"><span class="nm">(a)</span><p><span class="cl">(Mishnah):</span> Any of the following defects makes an animal a Tereifah:</p></div>
<div class="indent2"><span class="nm">1.</span><p>A puncture in any of the following - the Veshet; the membrane surrounding the brain; the heart (if the puncture reaches to the interior); the Kevah (last stomach); the gall bladder; the small intestines; the inner Keres (first stomach); the Masas (a middle stomach) or the Beis ha'Kosos (the connection between the Keres and Masas) (if the puncture extends to the outside);</p></div>
<div class="indent2"><span class="nm">2.</span><p>The lungs were punctured or are lacking;</p></div>
<div class="indent3"><span class="nm">i.</span><p>R. Shimon says, this is only if the puncture extends to the smaller branches.</p></div>
<div class="indent2"><span class="nm">3.</span><p>The majority of the outer Keres was torn;</p></div>
<div class="indent3"><span class="nm">i.</span><p>R. Yehudah says, this is for a small ox. For a large ox, it it only if one Tefach is torn;</p></div>
<div class="indent2"><span class="nm">4.</span><p>The (majority of the width of the) Kaneh was cut;</p></div>
<div class="indent2"><span class="nm">5.</span><p>The spine was broken, and the spinal cord snapped;</p></div>
<div class="indent2"><span class="nm">6.</span><p>The liver was totally removed;</p></div>
<div class="indent2"><span class="nm">7.</span><p>The animal fell from the roof;</p></div>
<div class="indent2"><span class="nm">8.</span><p>Most of the ribs were broken;</p></div>
<div class="indent2"><span class="nm">9.</span><p>An animal was Nidras (scratched and posioned) by a wolf;</p></div>
<div class="indent3"><span class="nm">i.</span><p>R. Yehudah says, a small animal was Nidras by a wolf, or (even) a large animal was Nidras by a lion.</p></div>
<div class="indent2"><span class="nm">10.</span><p>A small bird was Nidras by a Netz (small hawk or cuckoo?), or a large bird was Nidras by a Gas (large hawk).</p></div>
<div class="indent1"><span class="nm">(b)</span><p>The rule is, any injury that will cause an animal to die makes it a Tereifah.</p></div>
<div class="indent1"><span class="nm">(c)</span><p><span class="cl">(Gemara - Reish Lakish) Question:</span> Where does the Torah hint at the concept of Tereifah?</p></div>
<div class="indent1"><span class="nm">(d)</span><p><span class="cl">Objection:</span> It explicitly says "do not eat the meat of a Tereifah"!</p></div>
<div class="indent1"><span class="nm">(e)</span><p><span class="cl">(Clarification of question):</span> Rather, where does the Torah hint that a Tereifah cannot live?</p></div>
<div class="indent2"><span class="nm">1.</span><p>The Seifa implies that a Tereifah cannot live. What is the Tana's source?</p></div>
<div class="indent1"><span class="nm">(f)</span><p><span class="cl">Answer:</span> "This is the Chayah that you will eat" implies that a Tereifah, which you may not eat, is not Chai (alive).</p></div>
<div class="indent1"><span class="nm">(g)</span><p><span class="cl">Question:</span> What is the source for the opinion that argues, and says that a Tereifah can live?</p></div>
<div class="indent1"><span class="nm">(h)</span><p><span class="cl">Answer #1:</span> "This is the Chayah you may eat" implies that there is another Chayah (living animal) that you may not eat, namely a Tereifah.</p></div>
<div class="indent2"><span class="nm">1.</span><p>Our Tana expounds "this" like Tana d'Vei R. Yishmael;</p></div>
<div class="indent3"><span class="nm">i.</span><p><span class="cl">(Tana d'Vei R. Yishmael):</span> "This is the Chayah you may eat" teaches that Hash-m showed Moshe every species and told him which may be eaten.</p></div>
<div class="indent2"><span class="nm">2.</span><p><span class="cl">Question:</span> What is the other Tana's source for this?</p></div>
<div class="indent1"><span class="nm">(i)</span><p><span class="cl">Rejection (and answer to Question 2):</span> No, all expound "this" like Tana d'Vei R. Yishmael.</p></div>
<div class="indent1"><span class="nm">(j)</span><p><span class="cl">Answer #2:</span> The other Tana learns from a different teaching of Tana d'Vei R. Yishmael;</p></div>
<div class="indent2"><span class="nm">1.</span><p><span class="cl">(Beraisa - Tana d'Vei R. Yishmael):</span> "(To distinguish) between the Chayah that may be eaten and the Chayah that may not be eaten" - there are living animals that may not be eaten, namely, the 18 Tereifos that Hash-m taught to Moshe on Sinai.</p></div>
<div class="subject"><span class="nm">2)</span><p>THE 18 TEREIFOS</p></div>
<div class="indent1"><span class="nm">(a)</span><p><span class="cl">Questions:</span> There are Tereifos other than the 18 listed in the Mishnah!</p></div>
<div class="indent2"><span class="nm">1.</span><p>There are another four (the acronym BaShGaR alludes to them) and another seven that Amora'im taught (these will be taught later)!</p></div>
<div class="bbbline">42b----------------------------------------42b</p></div>
<div class="indent2"><span class="nm">2.</span><p>This is not difficult for the Tana of our Mishnah. He taught some Tereifos, and taught 'the rule is...' to allude to others.</p></div>
<div class="indent2"><span class="nm">3.</span><p>However, Tana d'Vei R. Yishmael says that there are exactly 18!</p></div>
<div class="indent1"><span class="nm">(b)</span><p><span class="cl">Question #1:</span> ('Beis' of BaShGaR) A Behemah whose hind legs were cut above the knee is Tereifah! (The Gemara (76a) discusses whether this refers to the higher or lower knee.)</p></div>
<div class="indent1"><span class="nm">(c)</span><p><span class="cl">Answer #1:</span> Tana d'Vei R. Yishmael holds like R. Shimon ben Elazar, who says that if the thigh is scalded (at the place of the cut), the animal can live.</p></div>
<div class="indent1"><span class="nm">(d)</span><p><span class="cl">Objection:</span> According to Tana d'Vei R. Yishmael, even an animal that can live can be Tereifah!</p></div>
<div class="indent1"><span class="nm">(e)</span><p><span class="cl">Answer #2:</span> Rather, Tana d'Vei R. Yishmael holds like R. Shimon ben Elazar, who says that this is not an (injury that makes an animal a) Tereifah.</p></div>
<div class="indent1"><span class="nm">(f)</span><p><span class="cl">Question #2:</span> ('Shin' of BaShGaR) If the Shidra (spine) of an animal is lacking, it is Tereifah!</p></div>
<div class="indent2"><span class="nm">1.</span><p><span class="cl">(Mishnah - Beis Shamai):</span> A spine missing two vertebrae is incomplete (it has no Tum'as Ohel);</p></div>
<div class="indent2"><span class="nm">2.</span><p>Beis Hillel say, even if one is missing it is incomplete.</p></div>
<div class="indent2"><span class="nm">3.</span><p><span class="cl">(Rav Yehudah):</span> The same amount missing makes an animal Tereifah.</p></div>
<div class="indent1"><span class="nm">(g)</span><p><span class="cl">Answer:</span> Our Mishnah lists punctures in the Masas and Beis ha'Kosos separately. Tana d'Vei R. Yishmael counts them like one. (When we add an incomplete spine, his count totals 18.)</p></div>
<div class="indent1"><span class="nm">(h)</span><p><span class="cl">Question #3:</span> (Gimel) Gludah (an animal missing all its skin) is Tereifah.</p></div>
<div class="indent1"><span class="nm">(i)</span><p><span class="cl">Answer:</span> Tana d'Vei R. Yishmael holds like R. Meir, who says that this is not a Tereifah.</p></div>
<div class="indent1"><span class="nm">(j)</span><p><span class="cl">Question #4:</span> (Reish) ChaRusah (an animal whose lungs dried up) is Tereifah.</p></div>
<div class="indent1"><span class="nm">(k)</span><p><span class="cl">Answer:</span> Our Tana listed a punctured gall bladder. He holds like R. Yosi b'Rebbi Yehudah. Tana d'Vei R. Yishmael holds that this is Kosher (and counts Charusah in place of it).</p></div>
<div class="indent1"><span class="nm">(l)</span><p><span class="cl">Question #5:</span> There are the seven Amora'ic teachings of Tereifos!</p></div>
<div class="indent2"><span class="nm">1.</span><p><span class="cl">(Rav Masnah):</span> A dislocated hip is Tereifah.</p></div>
<div class="indent2"><span class="nm">2.</span><p><span class="cl">(Rachish bar Papa):</span> An afflicted kidney is Tereifah.</p></div>
<div class="indent2"><span class="nm">3.</span><p><span class="cl">(Rav Avira):</span> Even though a Mishnah teaches that a missing spleen is Kosher, a punctured spleen is Tereifah.</p></div>
<div class="indent2"><span class="nm">4.</span><p><span class="cl">(Rabah bar bar Chanah):</span> If the Kaneh or Veshet (was uprooted, and) is mostly dangling (Rashi; Tosfos - they separated from each other), it is Tereifah.</p></div>
<div class="indent2"><span class="nm">5.</span><p><span class="cl">(Rabah bar bar Shilo):</span> The following are Tereifos:</p></div>
<div class="indent3"><span class="nm">i.</span><p>A rib was uprooted from the spine;</p></div>
<div class="indent3"><span class="nm">ii.</span><p>Or, most of the skull was Nichbesah (bruised or crushed);</p></div>
<div class="indent3"><span class="nm">iii.</span><p>Or, most of the flesh covering the majority of the Keres (the part not covered by the ribs) was torn.</p></div>
<div class="indent1"><span class="nm">(m)</span><p><span class="cl">Answer #1:</span> The Mishnah listed eight cases of punctures. Tana d'Vei R. Yishmael counts them like one, so with these seven teachings, his total is 18.</p></div>
<div class="indent2"><span class="nm">1.</span><p><span class="cl">Question #1:</span> If so, also the two cases of cuts in the Mishnah should count only like one! (If so, his total will be 17)!</p></div>
<div class="indent2"><span class="nm">2.</span><p><span class="cl">Question #2:</span> Rav Avira's case should not add to the count, for also his case is a puncture!</p></div>
<div class="indent1"><span class="nm">(n)</span><p><span class="cl">Answer:</span> Above, we said that Tana d'Vei R. Yishmael is Machshir an animal with cut legs and Gludah (to explain why he holds that there are 18 in all). Really, he agrees that these two are Tereifos.</p></div>
