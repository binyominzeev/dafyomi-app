<p class="bas subject"><span class="nm">1)</span>WHEN A BORROWER BECOMES LIABLE</p>
<p class="bas indent1"><span class="nm">(a)</span><span class="cl">(Gemara) Question:</span> If Reuven sent it with his own slave on Shimon's request, why is Shimon liable? A slave does not have his own Yad (power of acquisition). He can acquire only for his master. It is as if Reuven still has it!</p>
<p class="bas indent1"><span class="nm">(b)</span><span class="cl">Answer #1 (Shmuel):</span> The Mishnah discusses a Yisrael slave. Reuven owns only his labor. The slave has his own Yad.</p>
<p class="bas indent1"><span class="nm">(c)</span><span class="cl">Answer #2 (Rav):</span> It can even be a Kena'ani slave. It is as if Shimon said 'hit the cow so it will come to me.' Once it leaves Reuven's premises, Shimon is liable.</p>
<p class="bas indent1"><span class="nm">(d)</span><span class="cl">Question (Beraisa):</span> If Reuven lent Shimon a cow, and sent it (on Shimon's request) with his own son or Shali'ach, Shimon is liable. If Reuven sent it with his own slave, Shimon is exempt.</p>
<p class="bas indent2"><span class="nm">1.</span>Shmuel can say that the Beraisa discusses a Kena'ani slave. How can Rav answer?</p>
<p class="bas indent1"><span class="nm">(e)</span><span class="cl">Answer:</span> Rav did not mean that asking to send with a Kena'ani slave is as if Shimon said 'hit it so it will come to me.' Rather, the Mishnah discusses when Shimon actually said 'hit it...';</p>
<p class="bas indent2"><span class="nm">1.</span>In the Beraisa, Shimon just asked 'send it with your slave.'</p>
<p class="bas indent1"><span class="nm">(f)</span><span class="cl">(Rav Nachman citing Rav):</span> If Levi asked to borrow Yehudah's cow, and Yehudah asked with whom he should send it, and Levi said 'hit it and it will come to me', once it leaves Yehudah's premises, if it dies, Levi is liable.</p>
<p class="bas indent1"><span class="nm">(g)</span><span class="cl">Support (Beraisa):</span> If Levi asked to borrow Yehudah's cow, and Yehudah asked with whom he should send it, and Levi said 'hit it and it will come to me', once it leaves Yehudah's premises, if it dies, Levi is liable.</p>
<p class="bas indent1"><span class="nm">(h)</span><span class="cl">Rejection (Rav Ashi):</span> The case is, Levi's Chatzer was inside Yehudah's. It is sure to go to Levi after leaving Yehudah's Chatzer. (However, if it is a distance away, Levi is unsure if it will come to him, so he does not resolve to accept liability until it comes to him.)</p>
<p class="bas indent1"><span class="nm">(i)</span><span class="cl">Question:</span> If so, this is obvious. What is the Chidush of the Beraisa?</p>
<p class="bas indent1"><span class="nm">(j)</span><span class="cl">Answer:</span> There are small passages where it could hide. It is not absolutely certain that it will go to Levi. One might have thought that Levi does not resolve to accept liability. The Beraisa teaches that this is not so.</p>
<p class="bas subject"><span class="nm">2)</span>WHEN <i>SHOMRIM</i> MAKE A <i>KINYAN</i></p>
<p class="bas indent1"><span class="nm">(a)</span><span class="cl">(Rav Huna):</span> Reuven borrowed an axe from Shimon. Once he chops with it, he acquires it. Before chopping with it, he does not acquire it.</p>
<p class="bas indent1"><span class="nm">(b)</span><span class="cl">Question:</span> For what must he acquire it?</p>
<p class="bas indent2"><span class="nm">1.</span><span class="cl">Suggestion:</span> It is to be liable for Ones.</p>
<p class="bas indent2"><span class="nm">2.</span><span class="cl">Rejection:</span> This should be no different than a cow. He is liable once he borrows it, even before using it!</p>
<p class="bas indent1"><span class="nm">(c)</span><span class="cl">Answer:</span> Rather, it is so Shimon cannot demand that he return it (for the duration of the loan);</p>
<p class="bas indent2"><span class="nm">1.</span>Before Reuven chops with it, Shimon can demand that he return it.</p>
<p class="bas indent1"><span class="nm">(d)</span>Rav Huna argues with R. Ami.</p>
<p class="bas indent2"><span class="nm">1.</span><span class="cl">(R. Ami):</span> If Levi lent a Hekdesh axe to Yehudah, Levi transgressed Me'ilah according to the benefit he received (how much he would pay to be able to lend an axe). Yehudah may use it.</p>
<p class="bas indent2"><span class="nm">2.</span>If Yehudah did not acquire it (even before using it), why does Levi transgress, and why may Yehudah use it? He should be obligated to return it to avoid Me'ilah!</p>
<p class="bas indent1"><span class="nm">(e)</span>Rav Huna argues also with R. Elazar.</p>
<p class="bas indent2"><span class="nm">1.</span><span class="cl">(R. Elazar):</span> Just like Meshichah was enacted for buyers (to acquire in place of money), it was also enacted for Shomrim.</p>
<p class="bas indent1"><span class="nm">(f)</span><span class="cl">Support (Beraisa):</span> Just like Meshichah was enacted for buyers, it was also enacted for Shomrim;</p>
<p class="bas bbbline">99b----------------------------------------99b</p>
<p class="bas indent2"><span class="nm">1.</span>Just like land is acquired through money, a document or Chazakah, also rental is acquired through these.</p>
<p class="bas indent1"><span class="nm">(g)</span><span class="cl">Question:</span> How can one make Chazakah (on rented Metaltelim) without already acquiring through Meshichah?</p>
<p class="bas indent1"><span class="nm">(h)</span><span class="cl">Answer (Rav Chisda):</span> The Beraisa refers to rental of land.</p>
<p class="bas subject"><span class="nm">3)</span>WHICH PRICE DOES A THIEF PAY?</p>
<p class="bas indent1"><span class="nm">(a)</span><span class="cl">(Shmuel):</span> If Reuven stole 50 dates stuck together, which sell for 49 when sold together, and for 50 when sold individually:</p>
<p class="bas indent2"><span class="nm">1.</span>If he stole from an individual, he pays 49. If he took from Hekdesh, he pays 50 and a Chomesh;</p>
<p class="bas indent2"><span class="nm">2.</span>If he damaged Hekdesh, he does not add a fifth.</p>
<p class="bas indent2"><span class="nm">3.</span>"If one will eat Kodesh (he adds a fifth)." This excludes one who damages.</p>
<p class="bas indent1"><span class="nm">(b)</span><span class="cl">Question (Rav Bivi bar Abaye):</span> Why does he pay only 49 to an individual? The victim can say 'I would have sold them one at a time!'</p>
<p class="bas indent1"><span class="nm">(c)</span><span class="cl">Answer (Rav Huna brei d'Rav Yehoshua - Mishnah):</span> We evaluate damage by estimating the decreased value of a Beis Se'ah due to the damaged patch (Rashi; Tosfos - we estimate a damaged Beis Se'ah as part of a field 60 times greater). (I.e. we are lenient about damages!)</p>
<p class="bas indent1"><span class="nm">(d)</span><span class="cl">Question:</span> Does Shmuel really distinguish the laws of paying people and Hekdesh?!</p>
<p class="bas indent2"><span class="nm">1.</span><span class="cl">(Mishnah):</span> If Reuven (the treasurer of Hekdesh) took a rock or beam of Hekdesh, he did not transgress Me'ilah;</p>
<p class="bas indent2"><span class="nm">2.</span>If he gave it to Shimon, Reuven transgressed Me'ilah;</p>
<p class="bas indent2"><span class="nm">3.</span>If Reuven (kept it and) used it to build his house, he does not transgress Me'ilah until he gets a Perutah's worth of benefit from it by living in the house.</p>
<p class="bas indent2"><span class="nm">4.</span><span class="cl">(R. Avahu citing Shmuel):</span> We learn from this that if Levi dwells in Yehudah's field without his knowledge, Levi must pay!</p>
<p class="bas indent1"><span class="nm">(e)</span><span class="cl">Answer:</span> Shmuel retracted from that teaching.</p>
<p class="bas indent1"><span class="nm">(f)</span><span class="cl">Question:</span> Perhaps he retracted from this teaching!</p>
<p class="bas indent1"><span class="nm">(g)</span><span class="cl">Answer:</span> Presumably, he holds like Rava.</p>
<p class="bas indent2"><span class="nm">1.</span><span class="cl">(Rava):</span> One who takes from Hekdesh unknowingly is like one who takes from a person knowingly. (Therefore, we cannot learn about dwelling in a man's field without his knowledge from dwelling under Hekdesh.)</p>
<p class="bas indent1"><span class="nm">(h)</span><span class="cl">(Rava):</span> If burden carriers broke a barrel of wine, and on most days, it sells for four, but on the market day, the grocer sells it for five:</p>
<p class="bas indent2"><span class="nm">1.</span>If they replace it before the market day, that suffices. If not, they must pay five.</p>
<p class="bas indent2"><span class="nm">2.</span>This is only if the grocer did not have other wine to sell. If he did, they can return a barrel even after the market day.</p>
<p class="bas indent2"><span class="nm">3.</span>Even when they pay five, they deduct to compensate for the toil the grocer was spared (he did not have to sell it) and the cost of making a hole in the barrel (some explain - the cost of announcing that he has wine to sell).</p>
