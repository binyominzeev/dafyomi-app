<p class="bas subject"><span class="nm">1)</span>ADDING FROM NON-HOLY PERIODS TO HOLY PERIODS</p>
<p class="bas indent1"><span class="nm">(a)</span><span class="cl">Question:</span> How do we know that we add time from non-holy periods to holy periods?</p>
<p class="bas indent1"><span class="nm">(b)</span><span class="cl">Answer:</span> As taught by R. Akiva in a Beraisa:</p>
<p class="bas indent2"><span class="nm">1.</span>(R. Akiva) The Torah (Shemos 34:21) stated that one should refrain from plowing and harvesting, even though it had already stated that one may not sow in the seventh year.</p>
<p class="bas indent3"><span class="nm">i.</span>This comes to include the plowing immediately before the seventh year, and the harvesting immediately after.</p>
<p class="bas indent2"><span class="nm">2.</span>(R. Yishmael) The Torah is referring to Shabbos and comparing harvesting to plowing.</p>
<p class="bas indent3"><span class="nm">i.</span>It is teaching us that just as it is only voluntary plowing that is forbidden (as there is never any plowing that is a Mitzvah), so too it is only voluntary harvesting that is forbidden.</p>
<p class="bas indent3"><span class="nm">ii.</span>This excludes harvesting the Omer, which is a Mitzvah.</p>
<p class="bas indent1"><span class="nm">(c)</span><span class="cl">Question:</span> How does R. Yishmael know that we add time from non-holy periods to holy periods?</p>
<p class="bas indent1"><span class="nm">(d)</span><span class="cl">Answer:</span> He learns it in a Beraisa concerning Yom Kipur:</p>
<p class="bas indent2"><span class="nm">1.</span>(Beraisa) The Torah (Vayikra 23,32) states that "You should afflict yourselves on the ninth... in the evening."</p>
<p class="bas indent2"><span class="nm">2.</span>"On the ninth" implies that it should begin on the day of the ninth.</p>
<p class="bas indent2"><span class="nm">3.</span>"In the evening" implies that it should begin only on the eve of the tenth.</p>
<p class="bas indent2"><span class="nm">4.</span>The reconciliation is that one adds from the daytime hours of the ninth to the fast.</p>
<p class="bas indent2"><span class="nm">5.</span>This teaches us that we add time from non-holy periods to holy periods.</p>
<p class="bas indent2"><span class="nm">6.</span><span class="cl">Question:</span> How do we know that the end of Yom Kipur is also extended?</p>
<p class="bas indent2"><span class="nm">7.</span><span class="cl">Answer:</span> As it states that it must last "from evening to evening," including the following evening.</p>
<p class="bas indent2"><span class="nm">8.</span><span class="cl">Question:</span> How do we know that this also applies to Shabbos?</p>
<p class="bas indent2"><span class="nm">9.</span><span class="cl">Answer:</span> As it states that "you should rest" (referring to Yom Kipur, but alluding to Shabbos).</p>
<p class="bas indent2"><span class="nm">10.</span><span class="cl">Question:</span> How do we know that this also applies to Yom Tov?</p>
<p class="bas indent2"><span class="nm">11.</span><span class="cl">Answer:</span> As it states "Your rest" - this applies whenever there is a Mitzvah to rest.</p>
<p class="bas indent1"><span class="nm">(e)</span><span class="cl">Question:</span> For what does R. Akiva (who already had a source for extending the periods of holiness) use the words "You should afflict yourselves on the ninth" ?</p>
<p class="bas indent1"><span class="nm">(f)</span>He uses it in accordance with the following Beraisa:</p>
<p class="bas indent2"><span class="nm">1.</span>(Chiya bar Rav of Diftei) The Torah states that we should afflict ourselves on the ninth, even though this is really done only on the tenth, to tell us that whoever eats and drinks on the ninth is considered as though he has fasted on both the ninth and tenth.</p>

<p class="bas subject"><span class="nm">2)</span>THE CONDITIONS FOR <i>YOVEL</i></p>
<p class="bas indent1"><span class="nm">(a)</span>(R. Yehudah) "It is <i>Yovel</i>" (Vayikra 25,10) teaches us that it is Yovel regarding the prohibition to perform agricultural work even if the Mitzvos of returning land to its original owners and of the Shofar blowing  were not performed</p>
<p class="bas indent2"><span class="nm">1.</span>However, the prefix "It is" teaches that it is not Yovel if the servants were not released.</p>
<p class="bas indent1"><span class="nm">(b)</span>(R. Yosi) "It is <i>Yovel</i>" teaches us that it is Yovel regarding the prohibition to perform agricultural work  even if the procedures of returning land to its original owners and of releasing servants were not performed.</p>
<p class="bas indent2"><span class="nm">1.</span>However, the prefix "It is" teaches that it is not Yovel if the Shofar was not blown.</p>
<p class="bas indent1"><span class="nm">(c)</span>The Gemara now explores R. Yosi's reasoning:</p>
<p class="bas indent2"><span class="nm">1.</span><span class="cl">Question:</span> Since the word "Yovel" includes it as being Yovel even without certain criteria being fulfilled, and the words "It is" excludes it from being Yovel in the absence of other criteria, how do we know to place Shofar as the essential criterion and the release of servants as an inessential criterion?</p>
<p class="bas indent2"><span class="nm">2.</span><span class="cl">Answer:</span> It is possible that there would be no servants to be released, but it is not possible that there would be no Shofar to be blown.</p>
<p class="bas indent2"><span class="nm">3.</span><span class="cl">Alternative answer:</span> Releasing servants is dependant upon individuals, and we don't want Yovel to be contingent on their acquiescence; blowing the Shofar, on the other hand, is done by Beis Din.</p>
<p class="bas indent3"><span class="nm">i.</span><span class="cl">Question:</span> Why is an alternative answer necessary?</p>
<p class="bas indent3"><span class="nm">ii.</span><span class="cl">Answer:</span> As one might argue that it is impossible for there not to be a single servant in the world being released.</p>
<p class="bas indent1"><span class="nm">(d)</span><span class="cl">Question:</span> We have understood R. Yosi's reasoning; but what is R. Yehudah's reasoning?</p>
<p class="bas indent1"><span class="nm">(e)</span><span class="cl">Answer:</span> It is as follows:</p>
<p class="bas indent2"><span class="nm">1.</span>The Torah states "you shall call for Dror in the land" (that servants should be released) immediately before saying that "it is Yovel."</p>
<p class="bas indent2"><span class="nm">2.</span>R. Yehuda is of the opinion that a Pasuk is understood to be referring to the immediately preceding clause, and not to an earlier clause (such as that of blowing the Shofar).</p>
<p class="bas indent3"><span class="nm">i.</span><span class="cl">Question:</span> Why is it clear that "Dror" refers to releasing servants?</p>
<p class="bas indent3"><span class="nm">ii.</span><span class="cl">Answer:</span> As we have learned in a Beraisa that Dror refers to freedom.</p>
<p class="bas indent3"><span class="nm">iii.</span>(Beraisa)(R. Yehudah) The word "Dror" refers to a person who can live ("Dar") wherever he wants and do his business wherever he wants.</p>
<p class="bas indent1"><span class="nm">(f)</span>(R. Chiya bar Aba citing R. Yochanan) Thus far we have seen the opinions of R. Yehudah and R. Yosi; the Chachamim, however, hold that it is Yovel only if all three Mitzvos, (returning land to its original owners, releasing servants, and blowing Shofar) were performed.</p>
<p class="bas indent1"><span class="nm">(g)</span>The reason is that they understand a Pasuk to be referring to the immediately preceding clause (of releasing slaves), the earlier clause (of blowing Shofar), and the following clause (of returning land to its original owners).</p>
<p class="bas indent2"><span class="nm">1.</span><span class="cl">Question:</span> Why do the Chachmim  need the inclusive word of "Yovel" (implying that  it is Yovel in any case)?</p>
<p class="bas indent2"><span class="nm">2.</span><span class="cl">Answer:</span> To teach that releasing slaves  even applies in the Diaspora.</p>
<p class="bas indent2"><span class="nm">3.</span><span class="cl">Question:</span> So why does it say that Yovel is in "the land" (of Israel)?</p>
<p class="bas indent2"><span class="nm">4.</span><span class="cl">Answer:</span> To teach that it only applies in the Diaspora when it applies in the land of Israel.</p>
<p class="bas subject"><span class="nm">3)</span>THE NEW YEAR FOR ORLAH</p>
<p class="bas indent1"><span class="nm">(a)</span><span class="cl">Question:</span> How do we know that the new year for Orlah is on the first of Tishrei?</p>
<p class="bas indent1"><span class="nm">(b)</span><span class="cl">Answer:</span> The Torah (Vayikra 19 23) writes that fruit is permitted "in the fourth year" and we learn (by way of Gezerah Shavah) from the occurrence of the word "year" in this Pasuk "from the beginning of the year" in reference to Tishrei.(Devarim 11,12)</p>
<p class="bas indent2"><span class="nm">1.</span><span class="cl">Question:</span> Why not learn from the occurrence of the word "year" in the Pasuk "It is the first for you for the months of the year" in reference to Nisan? (Shemos 12,2)</p>
<p class="bas indent2"><span class="nm">2.</span><span class="cl">Answer:</span> We should learn the occurrence of the word "year" without any mention of   months from the same type, rather than learn it from the occurrence of the word in connection to the word months.</p>
<p class="bas subject"><span class="nm">4)</span>THE <i>TOSEFTA</i> ABOUT CALCULATING <i>ORLAH</i></p>
<p class="bas indent1"><span class="nm">(a)</span>When planting, bending the runner of a plant into the earth to take root, or grafting, before the beginning of the Shemitah year ,the following applies;-</p>
<p class="bas indent1"><span class="nm">(b)</span>If at least thirty days remain until Rosh Hashanah, it is counted as the first year for Orlah calculations, and the plant may be preserved through Shemitah.</p>
<p class="bas indent1"><span class="nm">(c)</span>If less than thirty days remain until Rosh Hashanah, it does  not count as the first year for Orlah calculations, and the plant may not be preserved through Shemitah.</p>
<p class="bas indent1"><span class="nm">(d)</span>Even where it was planted thirty days beforeRosh Hashanah , fruit that grew after Rosh Hashanah of the fourth year are Orlah; only those that will grow after the fifteenth of Shevat will be Revai and can be eaten in Yerushalayim.</p>
