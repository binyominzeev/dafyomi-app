<p class="bas subject"><span class="nm">1)</span>A WHIFF OF A <i>GET</i></p>
<p class="bas indent1"><span class="nm">(a)</span><span class="cl">(Mishnah - Beis Shamai):</span> If a man wrote a Get to divorce his wife, then decided not to, she is forbidden to Kohanim;</p>
<p class="bas indent1"><span class="nm">(b)</span>Beis Hillel say, even if he gave her a Get on Tanai, and the Tanai was not fulfilled, she is permitted to Kohanim.</p>
<p class="bas indent1"><span class="nm">(c)</span><span class="cl">(Gemara - Rav Yosef brei d'Rav Menasheh):</span> If there are rumors that a Kohen wrote a Get to divorce his wife, and they are living together, what do we do?</p>
<p class="bas indent1"><span class="nm">(d)</span><span class="cl">Answer (Shmuel):</span> She must leave. The matter needs investigation.</p>
<p class="bas indent1"><span class="nm">(e)</span><span class="cl">Question:</span> What must be investigated?</p>
<p class="bas indent2"><span class="nm">1.</span><span class="cl">Suggestion:</span> We must check whether or not we silence rumors.</p>
<p class="bas indent2"><span class="nm">2.</span><span class="cl">Rejection:</span> Shmuel is from Neharde'a. There, they do not silence rumors!</p>
<p class="bas indent1"><span class="nm">(f)</span><span class="cl">Answer:</span> Rather, we must check whether people say that a man 'wrote a Get' when he gave a Get.</p>
<p class="bas indent1"><span class="nm">(g)</span><span class="cl">Question:</span> Even if they do, since they say this also when he only wrote it, why should she be forbidden?</p>
<p class="bas indent1"><span class="nm">(h)</span><span class="cl">Answer:</span> She is forbidden due to Safek. Perhaps they meant that a Get was given.</p>
<p class="bas indent1"><span class="nm">(i)</span><span class="cl">Question:</span> Why must he divorce her? Rav Ashi taught that we are not concerned for rumors that begin after marriage!</p>
<p class="bas indent1"><span class="nm">(j)</span><span class="cl">Answer:</span> If she married another Kohen, he would have to divorce her.</p>
<p class="bas indent1"><span class="nm">(k)</span><span class="cl">Question:</span> This will make people think that her children from the first husband are disqualified from Kehunah (because she really was divorced)!</p>
<p class="bas indent1"><span class="nm">(l)</span><span class="cl">Answer:</span> Because we forced only the new husband to divorce her, but did not force the first husband, people will assume that he divorced her right before he died.</p>
<p class="bas indent1"><span class="nm">(m)</span><span class="cl">(Rabah bar bar Chanah):</span> The decline in the generations is awesome!</p>
<p class="bas indent2"><span class="nm">1.</span>The early generations were stringent, like Beis Shamai (who forbid a woman to Kehunah due to rumors that a Get was written):</p>
<p class="bas indent2"><span class="nm">2.</span>Later generations are lenient like R. Dosa.</p>
<p class="bas indent3"><span class="nm">i.</span><span class="cl">(Beraisa - R. Dosa):</span> A captured woman may eat Terumah. Just because the captor put his hands on her, should she be forbidden to Terumah?!</p>
<p class="bas indent2"><span class="nm">3.</span>Also, early generations brought their produce into the house through the gate, in order to obligate tithing it. Later generations bring their produce through the roof or yard in order to exempt it from tithes.</p>
<p class="bas indent3"><span class="nm">i.</span><span class="cl">(R. Yanai):</span> Produce need be tithed only once it sees (is brought in through) the opening of the house - "I eradicated the Kodesh from the house."</p>
<p class="bas indent3"><span class="nm">ii.</span><span class="cl">(R. Yochanan):</span> Even entering the yard obligates tithing it - "they will eat in your gates and be satiated."</p>
<p class="bas subject"><span class="nm">2)</span>CONCERN LEST A MAN REMARRIED HIS EX-WIFE</p>
<p class="bas indent1"><span class="nm">(a)</span><span class="cl">(Mishnah - Beis Shamai):</span> If a man divorced his wife and spent the night with her in an inn, he need not give her another Get;</p>
<p class="bas indent1"><span class="nm">(b)</span>Beis Hillel say, he must give her another Get.</p>
<p class="bas indent1"><span class="nm">(c)</span>This is when she was divorced from Nisu'in. If she was divorced from Eirusin, all agree that a second Get is not needed because he is not so intimate with her.</p>
<p class="bas indent1"><span class="nm">(d)</span><span class="cl">(Gemara - Rabah bar bar Chanah citing R. Yochanan):</span> The argument is when witnesses saw that they had Bi'ah;</p>
<p class="bas bbbline">81b----------------------------------------81b</p>
<p class="bas indent2"><span class="nm">1.</span>Beis Shamai hold that a man would have Bi'as Zenus (outside of wedlock). Beis Hillel hold that he would not (surely, he was Mekadesh her).</p>
<p class="bas indent2"><span class="nm">2.</span>If witnesses did not see Bi'ah, no one requires a second Get.</p>
<p class="bas indent1"><span class="nm">(e)</span><span class="cl">Question (Mishnah):</span> If she was divorced from Eirusin, all agree that a second Get is not needed because he is not so intimate with her.</p>
<p class="bas indent2"><span class="nm">1.</span>If witnesses saw Bi'ah, what difference does it make if the divorce was from Nisu'in or Eirusin?</p>
<p class="bas indent1"><span class="nm">(f)</span><span class="cl">Answer:</span> Indeed, the Mishnah is when witnesses did not see Bi'ah. R. Yochanan holds like R. Shimon ben Elazar;</p>
<p class="bas indent2"><span class="nm">1.</span><span class="cl">(Beraisa - R. Shimon ben Elazar):</span> If witnesses did not see Bi'ah, no one requires a second Get. They argue about when witnesses saw Bi'ah;</p>
<p class="bas indent3"><span class="nm">i.</span>Beis Shamai hold that a man would have Bi'as Zenus. Beis Hillel say that he would not.</p>
<p class="bas indent1"><span class="nm">(g)</span><span class="cl">Question:</span> In the Mishnah, witnesses did not see Bi'ah. What do Beis Shamai and Beis Hillel argue about?</p>
<p class="bas indent1"><span class="nm">(h)</span><span class="cl">Answer:</span> There are witnesses that they were secluded, but not that they had Bi'ah;</p>
<p class="bas indent2"><span class="nm">1.</span>Beis Shamai hold that witnesses of seclusion are not considered witnesses of Bi'ah;</p>
<p class="bas indent2"><span class="nm">2.</span>Beis Hillel say, (surely he had Bi'ah with her, so) they are like witnesses of Bi'ah.</p>
<p class="bas indent2"><span class="nm">3.</span>If she was divorced from Eirusin, all agree that a second Get is not needed because he is not so intimate with her. Witnesses of seclusion are not like witnesses of Bi'ah.</p>
<p class="bas indent1"><span class="nm">(i)</span><span class="cl">Question:</span> How can Yochanan hold like R. Shimon ben Elazar? R. Yochanan said that the Halachah always follows a Stam (anonymous) Mishnah!</p>
<p class="bas indent1"><span class="nm">(j)</span><span class="cl">Answer:</span> R. Yochanan did not say both of these teachings. Amora'im argue which one he said.</p>
<p class="bas subject"><span class="nm">3)</span>A BALD <i>GET</i></p>
<p class="bas indent1"><span class="nm">(a)</span><span class="cl">(Mishnah):</span> If a woman remarried after receiving a bald Get (it has too few witnesses), all the fines of the previous Mishnah apply.</p>
<p class="bas indent1"><span class="nm">(b)</span>Ben Nanas says, anyone may sign on a bald Get to complete the required number of witnesses;</p>
<p class="bas indent1"><span class="nm">(c)</span>R. Akiva says, the only Pasul witnesses allowed are relatives who are valid witnesses in other cases.</p>
<p class="bas indent2"><span class="nm">1.</span>A bald Get is one in which there are more folds than witnesses. (A Mekushar Get is one in which we fold the paper onto itself and sew it, and the witnesses sign on the back.).</p>
<p class="bas indent1"><span class="nm">(d)</span><span class="cl">(Gemara) Question:</span> Why is a bald Get Pasul?</p>
<p class="bas indent1"><span class="nm">(e)</span><span class="cl">Answer:</span> This is a decree due to when the husband says 'all of you sign this Get' (the Get is Pasul unless all sign).</p>
<p class="bas indent1"><span class="nm">(f)</span><span class="cl">(Mishnah - Ben Nanas):</span> Anyone may sign to complete the required number of witnesses...</p>
<p class="bas indent1"><span class="nm">(g)</span><span class="cl">Question:</span> Why doesn't R. Akiva allow a slave to sign?</p>
<p class="bas indent1"><span class="nm">(h)</span><span class="cl">Answer #1:</span> We are concerned lest people come to believe that the slave is a proper witness.</p>
<p class="bas indent1"><span class="nm">(i)</span><span class="cl">Rejection:</span> If so, he should not allow relatives, lest people think that relatives can testify!</p>
<p class="bas indent1"><span class="nm">(j)</span><span class="cl">Answer #2:</span> Rather, we are concerned lest people think that the slave has proper lineage.</p>
<p class="bas indent1"><span class="nm">(k)</span><span class="cl">Rejection:</span> If so, a robber (who has proper lineage) should be able to sign, but R. Akiva permits only relatives, who are valid witnesses in other cases!</p>
<p class="bas indent1"><span class="nm">(l)</span><span class="cl">Answer #3:</span> Rather, people will think that the slave was freed.</p>
<p class="bas indent2"><span class="nm">1.</span>Likewise, a robber may not sign, lest people think that he repented.</p>
<p class="bas indent2"><span class="nm">2.</span>There is no concern regarding relatives. All know that they are relatives!</p>
<p class="bas indent1"><span class="nm">(m)</span><span class="cl">Version #1 (R. Zeira):</span> They argue about a Get with at least four folds. If the Get has only three, all require the third witness to be (Kosher for other testimonies, e.g.) a relative.</p>
<p class="bas indent1"><span class="nm">(n)</span><span class="cl">Question (R. Zeira):</span> A Mekushar Get needs three witnesses just like a standard Get needs two. Why is a relative acceptable for the third witness?</p>
<p class="bas indent1"><span class="nm">(o)</span><span class="cl">Answer (Rav Ada bar Ahavah):</span> We are more lenient about the third witness on a Mekushar Get, since it is only mid'Rabanan.</p>
<p class="bas indent1"><span class="nm">(p)</span><span class="cl">Support (Beraisa - Ben Nanas):</span> If a Mekushar Get had seven folds and six (valid) witnesses, or six folds and five witnesses, or five folds and four witnesses, or four folds and three witnesses; and a slave signed to complete it, if she remarried, the children are not Mamzerim;</p>
<p class="bas indent2"><span class="nm">1.</span>R. Akiva says, the children are Mamzerim.</p>
<p class="bas indent2"><span class="nm">2.</span>If there are three folds, all agree that only a relative can sign.</p>
<p class="bas indent1"><span class="nm">(q)</span><span class="cl">Version #2 (Rav Yosef):</span> (R. Zeira taught that) if there are three folds, all agree that only a valid witness can sign.</p>
<p class="bas indent1"><span class="nm">(r)</span><span class="cl">Question (Beraisa):</span> If there are three folds, all agree that only a relative can sign.</p>
<p class="bas indent1"><span class="nm">(s)</span><span class="cl">Answer (Rav Papa):</span> Rav Yosef's text of the Beraisa says 'only a valid witness can sign.'</p>
<p class="bas indent1"><span class="nm">(t)</span><span class="cl">(R. Yochanan):</span> Only one relative may sign, not two, lest the Get be Mekuyam through two relatives and one valid witness.</p>
<p class="bas indent2"><span class="nm">1.</span><span class="cl">Support (Rav Ashi):</span> In every case, the above Beraisa allowed only one Pasul witness.</p>
