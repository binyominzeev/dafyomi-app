<div class="indent3"><span class="nm">i.</span><p><span class="cl">Question:</span> Zerikah (of blood) does not apply to a Minchah! (Haktarah is not called Zerikah.)</p></div>
<div class="indent3"><span class="nm">ii.</span><p><span class="cl">Answer (Rav Papa):</span> It refers to Minchas Nesachim.
