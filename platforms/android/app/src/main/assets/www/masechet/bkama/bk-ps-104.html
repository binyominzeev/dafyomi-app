<p class="bas subject"><span class="nm">1)</span>LIKE WHOM IS THE MISHNAH? (cont.)</p>
<p class="bas indent1"><span class="nm">(a)</span><span class="cl">Version #1 (our text, Rashi) Answer #3 (Rava):</span> Our Mishnah (is like both Tana'im. It) is unlike the Beraisa.</p>
<p class="bas indent1"><span class="nm">(b)</span><span class="cl">Version #2 (Tosfos' text) Answer (to Question 3:m, 103b - Rava):</span> Our Mishnah is like R. Tarfon; (end of Version #2)</p>
<p class="bas indent2"><span class="nm">1.</span>Since he knows that he stole from Shimon and admitted to him and could return the money, it is as if Shimon said 'the stolen object is like a deposit with you';</p>
<p class="bas indent2"><span class="nm">2.</span>If Reuven swore, he must travel to return the stolen object in order to (bring his Asham and) get atonement;</p>
<p class="bas indent2"><span class="nm">3.</span>If he did not swear, since Shimon allows him to guard the stolen object, he need not travel to return it.</p>
<p class="bas subject"><span class="nm">2)</span>WHAT IS NEEDED TO MAKE A <i>SHALI'ACH</i>?</p>
<p class="bas indent1"><span class="nm">(a)</span><span class="cl">(Mishnah):</span> It is not enough to give it to his son or Shali'ach...</p>
<p class="bas indent1"><span class="nm">(b)</span><span class="cl">(Rav Chisda):</span> If Reuven made Levi a Shali'ach (to take what Shimon owes him), he is considered a Shali'ach (if Shimon gives it to Levi, Shimon is exempt, even if Reuven never gets it);</p>
<p class="bas indent1"><span class="nm">(c)</span><span class="cl">(Rava):</span> He is not considered a Shali'ach.</p>
<p class="bas indent2"><span class="nm">1.</span>Rav Chisda says that he is a Shali'ach. Reuven bothered to appoint him in front of witnesses, so what is given to Levi will be considered to be in Reuven's Reshus!</p>
<p class="bas indent2"><span class="nm">2.</span>Rava says that he is not a Shali'ach. Reuven merely informs Shimon that Levi is trustworthy. If Shimon wants to rely on him, he may.</p>
<p class="bas indent1"><span class="nm">(d)</span><span class="cl">Question (Mishnah):</span> If David borrowed Moshe's cow, and Moshe sent it with his own son, slave or Shali'ach, or with David's son, slave or Shali'ach, and it died on the way, David is exempt.</p>
<p class="bas indent2"><span class="nm">1.</span><span class="cl">Question:</span> What is the case of (David's) Shali'ach?</p>
<p class="bas indent3"><span class="nm">i.</span><span class="cl">Suggestion:</span> He was not appointed in front of witnesses.</p>
<p class="bas indent3"><span class="nm">ii.</span><span class="cl">Version #1 (Rashi) Rejection:</span> If so, (why does the Mishnah call him a Shali'ach?) We do not know whether or not he was truly a Shali'ach!</p>
<p class="bas indent3"><span class="nm">iii.</span><span class="cl">Version #2 (Tosfos) Rejection:</span> If so, how did Moshe know that he was a Shali'ach? (Why did he send the cow with him?)</p>
<p class="bas indent2"><span class="nm">2.</span><span class="cl">Answer:</span> Rather, he was appointed in front of witnesses. (Even so, David is exempt. This refutes Rav Chisda!)</p>
<p class="bas indent1"><span class="nm">(e)</span><span class="cl">Answer:</span> We answer like Rav Chisda said (below), the Shali'ach was his housemate or hired help.</p>
<p class="bas indent1"><span class="nm">(f)</span><span class="cl">Question (against Rav Chisda - Mishnah):</span> It is not enough to give it to his son or Shali'ach.</p>
<p class="bas indent2"><span class="nm">1.</span><span class="cl">Question:</span> What is the case of his Shali'ach?</p>
<p class="bas indent3"><span class="nm">i.</span>If he was not appointed in front of witnesses, we do not know if he was a Shali'ach!</p>
<p class="bas indent2"><span class="nm">2.</span><span class="cl">Answer:</span> Rather, he was appointed in front of witnesses.</p>
<p class="bas indent1"><span class="nm">(g)</span><span class="cl">Answer (Rav Chisda):</span> The Shali'ach was his housemate or hired help.</p>
<p class="bas indent1"><span class="nm">(h)</span><span class="cl">Inference:</span> If he was appointed in front of witnesses, he would be a valid Shali'ach.</p>
<p class="bas indent1"><span class="nm">(i)</span><span class="cl">Question:</span> If so, why does the Reisha say that it suffices to give it to a Shali'ach of Beis Din? Rather, it should allow giving to a Shali'ach that Shimon (the owner of the stolen object) appointed in front of witnesses (to distinguish the two cases of Shimon's Shali'ach)!</p>
<p class="bas indent1"><span class="nm">(j)</span><span class="cl">Answer:</span> The Mishnah prefers to discuss a Shali'ach of Beis Din, for this always suffices (whether Reuven (the thief) or Shimon appointed him). A Shali'ach appointed in front of witnesses works only sometimes (if Shimon appointed him).</p>
<p class="bas indent1"><span class="nm">(k)</span>The Mishnah teaches unlike R. Shimon ben Elazar.</p>
<p class="bas indent2"><span class="nm">1.</span><span class="cl">(Beraisa - R. Shimon ben Elazar):</span> The thief is exempt in the following cases:</p>
<p class="bas indent3"><span class="nm">i.</span>He gave the stolen object to a Shali'ach of Beis Din who was appointed by the owner;</p>
<p class="bas indent3"><span class="nm">ii.</span>The thief appointed a Shali'ach of Beis Din, and a Shali'ach of the owner took the stolen object from this Shali'ach.</p>
<p class="bas indent1"><span class="nm">(l)</span><span class="cl">(R. Yochanan and R. Elazar):</span> A Shali'ach made in front of witnesses is considered a Shali'ach.</p>
<p class="bas indent1"><span class="nm">(m)</span><span class="cl">Question:</span> The Mishnah does not allow giving it to Levi, the Shali'ach of Shimon (the owner. Presumably, Levi was appointed in front of witnesses!)</p>
<p class="bas indent1"><span class="nm">(n)</span><span class="cl">Answer #1:</span> Shimon did not appoint Levi to be a Shali'ach. He merely told him to appear in front of Reuven, in case Reuven wants to send it with him.</p>
<p class="bas indent1"><span class="nm">(o)</span><span class="cl">Answer #2:</span> We answer like Rav Chisda said. Levi (was not appointed, he) is Shimon's housemate or hired help.</p>

<p class="bas subject"><span class="nm">3)</span>WHAT PROOF OF AUTHORIZATION IS REQUIRED?</p>
<p class="bas indent1"><span class="nm">(a)</span><span class="cl">(Rav Yehudah citing Shmuel):</span> If Reuven had money deposited with Shimon, and he sent Levi with a letter saying to send it with Levi, and Reuven's stamp (of his signet ring) is underneath, Shimon may not send the money with him. This applies even if witnesses signed on it.</p>
<p class="bas indent1"><span class="nm">(b)</span><span class="cl">(R. Yochanan):</span> If witnesses signed on it, he may send it.</p>
<p class="bas indent1"><span class="nm">(c)</span><span class="cl">Question:</span> According to Shmuel, how can Reuven retrieve his money (without going himself)?</p>
<p class="bas indent1"><span class="nm">(d)</span><span class="cl">Answer:</span> He can do like R. Aba;</p>
<p class="bas indent2"><span class="nm">1.</span>R. Aba asked Rav Safra to bring to him money that Rav Yosef bar Chama owed to him.</p>
<p class="bas indent2"><span class="nm">2.</span><span class="cl">Rava (Rav Yosef's son):</span> Did R. Aba write 'when you give it to Rav Safra, it is as if I received it'?</p>
<p class="bas indent2"><span class="nm">3.</span><span class="cl">Rav Safra:</span> No.</p>
<p class="bas indent2"><span class="nm">4.</span><span class="cl">Rava:</span> Return and ask him to write that.</p>
<p class="bas indent2"><span class="nm">5.</span><span class="cl">Retraction (Rava):</span> Even if he writes that, we do not rely on it. If R. Aba would die (after writing it and before you take the money), the money would pass to his heirs, and they did not authorize you!</p>
<p class="bas indent2"><span class="nm">6.</span><span class="cl">Rav Safra:</span> So how can I bring the money to him?</p>
<p class="bas indent2"><span class="nm">7.</span><span class="cl">Rava:</span> He should give (ownership of) the money to you Agav (along with giving you) the corner of his house (i.e. a small piece of land). When we give to you the money, you will write a receipt.</p>
<p class="bas indent1"><span class="nm">(e)</span>A similar case occurred with Rav Papa. He was owed 12,000 Zuz in Bei Chuzai. He gave the money to Rav Shmuel bar Aba, Agav the corner of his house, who then brought to him the money.</p>
<p class="bas subject"><span class="nm">4)</span>THE OBLIGATION TO PAY <i>CHOMESH</i></p>
<p class="bas indent1"><span class="nm">(a)</span><span class="cl">(Mishnah):</span> If he paid the principal (but not the Chomesh, he need not travel to return it).</p>
<p class="bas indent1"><span class="nm">(b)</span><span class="cl">Inference:</span> Since the Mishnah must teach that he need not travel to return it, it must be that the Chomesh is considered a proper debt, and if Shimon dies, Reuven must pay it to his heirs.</p>
<p class="bas indent1"><span class="nm">(c)</span><span class="cl">Support #1 (Mishnah):</span> If Reuven paid the principal, and (falsely) swore that he also paid the Chomesh, he must pay (the Chomesh and) an additional fifth of the Chomesh. (This shows that it is like a proper debt.)</p>
<p class="bas indent1"><span class="nm">(d)</span><span class="cl">Support #2 (Beraisa #1):</span> If Levi stole from Yehudah, swore falsely, and died, Levi's heirs pay the principal and the Chomesh. They do not bring an Asham.</p>
<p class="bas indent1"><span class="nm">(e)</span><span class="cl">Question:</span> Do heirs really pay the Chomesh?</p>
<p class="bas indent2"><span class="nm">1.</span><span class="cl">Contradiction (Beraisa #2):</span> One might have thought that the only exemption (for a son from paying an Chomesh on what his father stole) is when neither the son nor the father swore;</p>
<p class="bas indent2"><span class="nm">2.</span><span class="cl">Question:</span> What is the source that even if the father or son swore falsely, the son is exempt?</p>
<p class="bas indent2"><span class="nm">3.</span><span class="cl">Answer:</span> "That (he) stole and oppressed" - the son did not steal or oppress.</p>
<p class="bas indent1"><span class="nm">(f)</span><span class="cl">Answer (Rav Nachman):</span> Beraisa #1 discusses when the father later admitted. Beraisa #2 discusses when he (the father, and also the son) never admitted.</p>
<p class="bas indent1"><span class="nm">(g)</span><span class="cl">Question:</span> If they never admitted, why does the son pay principal?</p>
<p class="bas indent2"><span class="nm">1.</span><span class="cl">Suggestion:</span> Perhaps he does not pay principal!</p>
<p class="bas indent2"><span class="nm">2.</span><span class="cl">Rejection #1:</span> The Beraisa needed to teach that he is exempt from the Chomesh. This implies that he pays principal.</p>
<p class="bas indent2"><span class="nm">3.</span><span class="cl">Rejection #2 (Seifa of Beraisa #2):</span> One might have thought that a son pays the principal that his father stole only when both of them swore falsely;</p>
<p class="bas indent3"><span class="nm">i.</span><span class="cl">Question:</span> What is the source that if only one of them, or even neither swore falsely, the son pays principal?</p>
<p class="bas indent3"><span class="nm">ii.</span><span class="cl">Answer:</span> "Theft, oppression, Aveidah, deposit"; Yesh Talmud (this will be explained).</p>
<p class="bas indent3"><span class="nm">iii.</span>Rav Huna taught this Beraisa to his son Rabah.</p>
<p class="bas indent3"><span class="nm">iv.</span><span class="cl">Question (Rabah):</span> Did you conclude 'Yesh Talmud' (we learn from these words) or 'Yishtalmo' (he will pay it; we know from reasoning, and not from a verse)?</p>
<p class="bas indent3"><span class="nm">v.</span><span class="cl">Answer (Rav Huna):</span> I concluded 'Yesh Talmud.' We learn from the verse.</p>
<p class="bas indent1"><span class="nm">(h)</span><span class="cl">Answer:</span> Rav Nachman said that in Beraisa #2, he never admitted, i.e. the father, but the son admitted.</p>
<p class="bas indent1"><span class="nm">(i)</span><span class="cl">Question:</span> The son should be liable to pay the Chomesh for his own false oath!</p>
<p class="bas indent1"><span class="nm">(j)</span><span class="cl">Answer #1:</span> The case is, the stolen object is not around (the son swore about money that he was not liable to pay for).</p>
<p class="bas indent1"><span class="nm">(k)</span><span class="cl">Question:</span> If so, why does he pay principal?</p>
<p class="bas indent1"><span class="nm">(l)</span><span class="cl">Version #1 (our text, Tosfos) Answer:</span> The case is, the son inherited land.</p>
<p class="bas indent1"><span class="nm">(m)</span><span class="cl">Question:</span> Even if he inherited land, the stolen object is like a Milveh Al Peh (loan without a document), which cannot be collected from heirs or buyers!</p>
<p class="bas indent1"><span class="nm">(n)</span><span class="cl">Answer:</span> The case is, the father was taken to Beis Din (and was obligated to pay through testimony of witnesses. This makes it like a loan with a document.)</p>
<p class="bas indent1"><span class="nm">(o)</span><span class="cl">Version #2 (Rashi) Answer:</span> The case is, the son inherited land (so he must return the stolen object due to the honor of his father). (end of Version #2)</p>
