<p class="bas indent1"><span class="nm">(a)</span><span class="cl">(Mishnah - Chachamim):</span> [Both of these are forbidden...]</p>
<p class="bas indent1"><span class="nm">(b)</span><span class="cl">Question:</span> If one hung it, what is the law?</p>
<p class="bas indent1"><span class="nm">(c)</span><span class="cl">Answer #1 (Rav Yosef):</span> He is Chayav Chatas.</p>
<p class="bas indent1"><span class="nm">(d)</span><span class="cl">Objection (Abaye):</span> If so, if someone hung a flask on a peg, is he [also] Chayav?</p>
<p class="bas indent1"><span class="nm">(e)</span><span class="cl">Answer #2 (Abaye):</span> It is forbidden mid'Rabanan, lest one behave as if it is a weekday.</p>
<p class="bas indent1"><span class="nm">(f)</span>Abaye consolidated laws from several Beraisos:</p>
<p class="bas indent2"><span class="nm">1.</span>The following are forbidden, but if one did them he is exempt - stretching out a leather pouch on pegs (this is like making an Ohel), hanging a Meshameres, spreading Kilah (a canopy over a bed), and assembling a chair that comes apart;</p>
<p class="bas indent2"><span class="nm">2.</span>If one made a permanent Ohel, he is Chayav Chatas;</p>
<p class="bas indent2"><span class="nm">3.</span>The following are permitted - putting a bed (that was on its side) on its legs, and opening a folding chair or toilet seat.</p>
<p class="bas indent1"><span class="nm">(g)</span><span class="cl">(Mishnah):</span> One may not put wine in a hanging Meshameres on Shabbos.</p>
<p class="bas indent1"><span class="nm">(h)</span><span class="cl">Question:</span> If one strained wine through it, what is the law?</p>
<p class="bas indent1"><span class="nm">(i)</span><span class="cl">Answer #1 (Rav Kahana):</span> He is Chayav Chatas.</p>
<p class="bas indent1"><span class="nm">(j)</span><span class="cl">Objection (Rav Sheshes):</span> It is unreasonable that R. Eliezer permits something for which Chachamim Mechayev Chatas!</p>
<p class="bas indent1"><span class="nm">(k)</span><span class="cl">Counter-objection (Rav Yosef):</span> Why is this unreasonable? R. Meir is Mechayev Chatas for wearing Ir Shel Zahav [in Reshus ha'Rabim], and R. Eliezer permits!</p>
<p class="bas indent2"><span class="nm">1.</span><span class="cl">(Beraisa - R. Meir):</span> A woman may not go out wearing Ir Shel Zahav - if she did [in Reshus ha'Rabim], she is Chayeves Chatas;</p>
<p class="bas indent2"><span class="nm">2.</span>Chachamim say, she may not go out with it; if she did, she is exempt;</p>
<p class="bas indent2"><span class="nm">3.</span>R. Eliezer permits going out with it.</p>
<p class="bas indent1"><span class="nm">(l)</span><span class="cl">Answer (Abaye):</span> R. Eliezer does not respond to R. Meir, rather, to Chachamim, who forbid and exempt. (Tosfos ha'Rosh - there is a 'Tana Kama' who forbids; Chachamim argue with him. R. Eliezer and R. Meir argue about the argument - R. Meir says that the Tana Kama is Mechayev Chatas, and Chachamim forbid but exempt; R. Eliezer says that the Tana Kama forbids but exempts, and Chachamim permit. If both R. Meir and R. Eliezer themselves forbid but exempt, there is not really a wide argument, just one holds that there is a Tana who is Mechayev, the other holds that there is a Tana who permits - <b>PF</b>. Alternatively, perhaps Chachamim forbid even in a Chatzer (like Rav and the Stam Mishnayos 57A and 64B), and R. Eliezer permits (like R. Yishmael, 64B). Rashash - it is not a wide argument - R. Meir holds that because it is forbidden l'Chatchilah, it is no longer a Tachshit, therefore one is liable.)</p>
<p class="bas indent1"><span class="nm">(m)</span><span class="cl">Question:</span> For which [Av] Melachah do we warn him [for straining? Surely, if he was warned incorrectly he is not killed; Tosfos (Bava Kama 2A ul'R. Eliezer) is unsure whether or not one must be warned for the Av.]</p>
<p class="bas indent1"><span class="nm">(n)</span><span class="cl">Answer #1 (Rabah):</span> We warn him for Borer.</p>
<p class="bas indent1"><span class="nm">(o)</span><span class="cl">Answer #2 (R. Zeira):</span> We warn him for Meraked (sifting out Pesoles).</p>
<p class="bas indent1"><span class="nm">(p)</span><span class="cl">Support (Rabah, for himself):</span> Straining resembles Borer, to take the food and leave the Pesoles (the wine comes through, the dregs are left in the Meshameres. Tosfos - it is the way to take the food only when there is more Pesoles.)</p>
<p class="bas indent1"><span class="nm">(q)</span><span class="cl">Support (R. Zeira, for himself):</span> Straining resembles Meraked, the food goes to the bottom, the Pesoles is left on top. (Rambam rules that he is liable for Meraked <i>or</i> Borer.)</p>
<p class="bas subject"><span class="nm">2)</span>PROHIBITIONS ON ACCOUNT OF MAKING AN <i>OHEL</i></p>
<p class="bas indent1"><span class="nm">(a)</span><span class="cl">(Rami bar Yechezkeil - Beraisa):</span> One may not spread a Talis on four pegs - if he did, he is exempt.</p>
<p class="bas indent1"><span class="nm">(b)</span>If it was wrapped on a pole by a thread or string from before Shabbos, one may spread it on Shabbos (he adds to a temporary Ohel).</p>
<p class="bas indent1"><span class="nm">(c)</span><span class="cl">Question (Rav Kahana):</span> What is the law concerning Kilah?</p>
<p class="bas indent1"><span class="nm">(d)</span><span class="cl">Answer (Rav):</span> Even [some] beds are forbidden (this will be explained).</p>
<p class="bas indent2"><span class="nm">1.</span><span class="cl">Question (Rav Kahana):</span> What is the law concerning a bed?</p>
<p class="bas indent2"><span class="nm">2.</span><span class="cl">Answer (Rav):</span> Even [some] Kilos are permitted.</p>
<p class="bas indent2"><span class="nm">3.</span><span class="cl">Question (Rav Kahana):</span> What are the laws concerning Kilah and a bed?</p>
<p class="bas indent2"><span class="nm">4.</span><span class="cl">Answer (Rav):</span> Kilah is forbidden, a bed is permitted.</p>
<p class="bas indent1"><span class="nm">(e)</span><span class="cl">Resolution:</span> Rav forbade even beds regarding assembling a bed that comes apart; he permitted even Kilos like Rami bar Yechezkeil (they are on strings, he merely extends them); he forbade Kilah and permitted a bed in the usual case (Kilah without a string, and standing a bed on its legs).</p>
<p class="bas indent1"><span class="nm">(f)</span><span class="cl">(Rav Yosef):</span> I saw the Kilos of Rav Huna's house - on Shabbos night they were spread, on Shabbos morning they were [dismantled] on the floor.</p>
<p class="bas indent1"><span class="nm">(g)</span><span class="cl">(Rav citing R. Chiya):</span> It is permitted to spread a curtain [in a doorway] and to take it down.</p>
<p class="bas indent1"><span class="nm">(h)</span><span class="cl">(Shmuel citing R. Chiya):</span> It is permitted to spread Kilas Chasanim (a canopy spread over a pole running lengthwise above the middle of the bed, it slopes down on both sides) and to take it down.</p>
<p class="bas bbbline">138b----------------------------------------138b</p>
<p class="bas indent1"><span class="nm">(i)</span><span class="cl">(Rav Sheshes brei d'Rav Idi):</span> This is only if the top is not a Tefach wide - otherwise, it is forbidden [on account of making an Ohel];</p>
<p class="bas indent2"><span class="nm">1.</span>Even if the top is not a Tefach wide, if within three Tefachim of the top the width [between sides] is a Tefach, it is forbidden;</p>
<p class="bas indent2"><span class="nm">2.</span>It is permitted only if [at the bottom] the sides are not a Tefach from the middle - if there is, it is forbidden, for a slanted Ohel is considered an Ohel. (Rashi - the total width is at most two Tefachim, it is not made to sleep under. Tosfos - perhaps the canopy rests on several poles, the width between any two must be less than a Tefach; alternatively, perhaps we are concerned only if 10 Tefachim above the bed it is a Tefach wide. Rashbam deletes this clause from the text, for a slanted Ohel is not considered an Ohel (Sukah 19B).)</p>
<p class="bas indent2"><span class="nm">3.</span>It is permitted only if it does not hang a Tefach below [the sides of] the bed - if it does, it is forbidden (it makes the bed a roof with walls on two sides).</p>
<p class="bas indent1"><span class="nm">(j)</span><span class="cl">(Rav Sheshes brei d'Rav Idi):</span> It is permitted to wear a felt hat on Shabbos.</p>
<p class="bas indent1"><span class="nm">(k)</span><span class="cl">Question:</span> It was taught that it is forbidden!</p>
<p class="bas indent1"><span class="nm">(l)</span><span class="cl">Answer #1:</span> It is forbidden [on account of an Ohel] only if it spreads out a Tefach from his head.</p>
<p class="bas indent1"><span class="nm">(m)</span><span class="cl">Objection:</span> Is one liable if he (Rosh' text - is it forbidden to) spread a Talis a Tefach over his head?!</p>
<p class="bas indent1"><span class="nm">(n)</span><span class="cl">Version #1 (R. Chananel) Answer:</span> A hat is tight (it is like an Ohel), a Talis is not tight.</p>
<p class="bas indent1"><span class="nm">(o)</span><span class="cl">Version #2 (Rashi) Answer #2:</span> Rather, it is forbidden if it does not fit well (Rashi - lest it will blow off and he will carry it).</p>
<p class="bas indent1"><span class="nm">(p)</span><span class="cl">(Beraisa):</span> One may spread a leather pouch with straps in its normal place.</p>
<p class="bas indent1"><span class="nm">(q)</span><span class="cl">(Rav):</span> Two people may spread it, one may not (Rashi - he stretches it out well; Rashba - he ties one end at a time, the way Ohalim are made).</p>
<p class="bas indent1"><span class="nm">(r)</span><span class="cl">(Abaye):</span> Kilah is forbidden even with 10 people, for it will surely be stretched.</p>
<p class="bas indent1"><span class="nm">(s)</span><span class="cl">(Beraisa):</span> If one leg of an oven came off, the oven may be moved; if two came off, it is forbidden;</p>
<p class="bas indent1"><span class="nm">(t)</span><span class="cl">(Rav):</span> Even if one came off it is forbidden - this is a decree lest he bang it in.</p>
<p class="bas subject"><span class="nm">3)</span>WILL TORAH BE FORGOTTEN?</p>
<p class="bas indent1"><span class="nm">(a)</span><span class="cl">(Rav):</span> In the future Torah will be forgotten from Yisrael - it says "<i>V'Hifla</i> Hash-m Es Makosecha", just like "Hineni Yosef Lehafli Es ha'Am ha'Zeh Haflei va'Fele [...v"Ovda Chachmas Chachamav]", which refers to Torah.</p>
<p class="bas indent1"><span class="nm">(b)</span><span class="cl">(Beraisa):</span> In Yavneh they taught that in the future Torah will be forgotten from Yisrael - it says "Hinei Yomim Ba'im...v'Hishlachti Ra'av ba'Aretz...Lishmo'a Es Divrei Hash-m", and "...Yeshotetu Levakesh Es Devar Hash-m v'Lo Yimtza'u";</p>
<p class="bas indent2"><span class="nm">1.</span>"Devar Hash-m" refers to Halachah, the Ketz (latest possible time for Moshi'ach to come), and prophecy.</p>
<p class="bas indent1"><span class="nm">(c)</span><span class="cl">Question:</span> What does it mean "Yeshotetu Levakesh Es Devar Hash-m"?</p>
<p class="bas indent1"><span class="nm">(d)</span><span class="cl">Answer:</span> A woman will take a loaf of Terumah to synagogues and Batei Medrash to find out if it is Tahor or Tamei. (In the name of Noda bi'Yhudah - she will take the loaf [and not just tell what happened], because people will not know the Halachah, they will need to look for 'clouds of Tum'ah' over it.)</p>
<p class="bas indent1"><span class="nm">(e)</span><span class="cl">Question:</span> Even if they forgot, this is explicitly written [that all foods Mekabel Tum'ah] - "Mi'Kol ha'Ochel Asher Ye'achel"!</p>
<p class="bas indent1"><span class="nm">(f)</span><span class="cl">Answer:</span> Rather, she will ask if it is a Rishon [l'Tum'ah] or a Sheni.</p>
<p class="bas indent1"><span class="nm">(g)</span><span class="cl">Question:</span> Also this is explicit [Maharshal - in the Torah], like a Mishnah teaches!</p>
<p class="bas indent2"><span class="nm">1.</span><span class="cl">(Mishnah):</span> If a [dead] Sheretz was found in a [Cheres] oven, the bread inside is a Sheni, for the oven is a Rishon.</p>
<p class="bas indent1"><span class="nm">(h)</span><span class="cl">Answer:</span> They will be unsure about Rav Ada bar Ahavah's question:</p>
<p class="bas indent2"><span class="nm">1.</span><span class="cl">Question (Rav Ada):</span> We should view the entire oven as if it was full of Tum'ah [because the Sheretz is Metamei the entire contents], and the loaf should be a Rishon!</p>
<p class="bas indent2"><span class="nm">2.</span><span class="cl">Answer (Rava):</span> We do not view it like this:</p>
<p class="bas indent3"><span class="nm">i.</span><span class="cl">(Beraisa) Suggestion:</span> Perhaps all Kelim are Mekabel Tum'ah from the airspace of a Kli Cheres!</p>
<p class="bas indent3"><span class="nm">ii.</span><span class="cl">Rejection:</span> "Kol Asher b'Socho Yitma...; Mi'Kol ha'Ochel Asher Ye'achel" - food is Mekabel Tum'ah from the airspace of a Kli Cheres, Kelim are not.</p>
<p class="bas indent1"><span class="nm">(i)</span><span class="cl">(Beraisa - R. Shimon):</span> Heaven forbid that Torah would be forgotten from Yisrael - "Ki Lo Sishakach mi'Pi Zar'o". (Maharsha - the others explain that this refers only to Shiras Ha'azinu.)</p>
<p class="bas indent1"><span class="nm">(j)</span><span class="cl">Question:</span> How do we explain "Yeshotetu Levakesh Es Devar Hash-m"?</p>
<p class="bas indent1"><span class="nm">(k)</span><span class="cl">Answer:</span> They will not find the Halachah and Mishnah clear [even] in one place (there will be many different opinions).</p>
