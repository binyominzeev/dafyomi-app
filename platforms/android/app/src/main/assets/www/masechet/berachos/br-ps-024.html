<p class="bas indent1"><span class="nm">(a)</span><span class="cl">Question:</span> Exactly where does one leave them?</p>
<p class="bas indent1"><span class="nm">(b)</span><span class="cl">Answer (R. Yirmeyah):</span> He leaves them between the pillow and blanket, not directly under his head.</p>
<p class="bas indent1"><span class="nm">(c)</span><span class="cl">Question (Beraisa):</span> He leaves them in their pouch, under his head.</p>
<p class="bas indent1"><span class="nm">(d)</span><span class="cl">Answer:</span> The bulge (the part of the pouch in which the Tefilin rest) is not directly under his head.</p>
<p class="bas indent1"><span class="nm">(e)</span>Bar Kapara would wrap them in the curtain around his bed, the bulge was facing the outside.</p>
<p class="bas indent1"><span class="nm">(f)</span>Rav Shisha brei d'Rav Idi put them on a stool and put his cloth over them.</p>
<p class="bas indent1"><span class="nm">(g)</span><span class="cl">Rav Hamnuna brei d'Rav Yosef:</span> Rava asked me to bring his Tefilin; they were [in a pouch] between the pillow and blanket, not directly where his head would rest;</p>
<p class="bas indent2"><span class="nm">1.</span>I knew that his wife had immersed the night before (surely, they had relations); he intended to show me that we rely on Shmuel in practice.</p>
<p class="bas subject"><span class="nm">2)</span>SAYING SHEMA NEAR A NAKED PERSON</p>
<p class="bas indent1"><span class="nm">(a)</span><span class="cl">Question (Rav Yosef brei d'Rav Nechunya):</span> If two are sleeping (naked) on a bed, may each turn his head away to say Keri'as Shema?</p>
<p class="bas indent1"><span class="nm">(b)</span><span class="cl">Answer (Rav Yehudah citing Shmuel):</span> It is permitted, even if his wife is with him.</p>
<p class="bas indent1"><span class="nm">(c)</span><span class="cl">Question (Rav Yosef):</span> To the contrary! One's wife is like one's own body (Rashi - he is used to her, his thoughts are not aroused much); it is a bigger Chidush that it is permitted with someone else!</p>
<p class="bas indent1"><span class="nm">(d)</span><span class="cl">Question (Beraisa #1):</span> If two are sleeping on a bed, each turns his head away to say Keri'as Shema;</p>
<p class="bas indent2"><span class="nm">1.</span><span class="cl">(Beraisa #2):</span> If one is sleeping on a bed with his sons or [other members of his] household, he may not say Shema unless a garment separates between them;</p>
<p class="bas indent2"><span class="nm">2.</span>If his sons and household are small (this will be explained), no garment is needed.</p>
<p class="bas indent2"><span class="nm">3.</span>Rav Yosef can explain that Beraisa #1 discusses his wife, and Beraisa #2 discusses members of his household other than his wife;</p>
<p class="bas indent2"><span class="nm">4.</span>But Shmuel permits in all cases -- how does he reconcile the Beraisos?</p>
<p class="bas indent2"><span class="nm">5.</span><span class="cl">Version #1 (our text, Rashi) Counter-question (on behalf of Shmuel - Beraisa #2):</span> If one is sleeping on a bed with his sons or household, he may not say Shema unless a garment separates.</p>
<p class="bas indent3"><span class="nm">i.</span>Surely, "household" includes his wife (the answer given above for Rav Yosef is untenable)!</p>
<p class="bas indent2"><span class="nm">6.</span><span class="cl">Version #2 (Tosfos) Counter-question (on behalf of Shmuel - Beraisa):</span> If one is sleeping on a bed next to his wife, he may not say Shema unless a garment separates. (End of Version #2)</p>
<p class="bas indent2"><span class="nm">7.</span><span class="cl">Answer:</span> Rav Yosef must say that Tana'im argue about whether or not a garment must separate between him and his wife.</p>
<p class="bas indent1"><span class="nm">(e)</span><span class="cl">Answer:</span> Shmuel may also say that Tana'im argue about whether or not a garment must separate between him and his wife!</p>
<p class="bas indent1"><span class="nm">(f)</span><span class="cl">(Beraisa #1):</span> If two are sleeping on a bed, each turns his head away to say Keri'as Shema.</p>
<p class="bas indent1"><span class="nm">(g)</span><span class="cl">Question:</span> Why is this permitted? Their buttocks touch the other!</p>
<p class="bas indent1"><span class="nm">(h)</span><span class="cl">Answer:</span> This supports Rav Huna:</p>
<p class="bas indent2"><span class="nm">1.</span><span class="cl">(Rav Huna):</span> The buttocks are not considered Ervah.</p>
<p class="bas indent1"><span class="nm">(i)</span><span class="cl">Suggestion:</span> A Mishnah also supports Rav Huna:</p>
<p class="bas indent2"><span class="nm">1.</span><span class="cl">(Mishnah):</span> A woman can sit naked and separate Chalah (with a blessing), because she can cover her Ervah (even though her buttocks are exposed); a man may not [do so, for the ground does not cover his Ervah].</p>
<p class="bas indent1"><span class="nm">(j)</span><span class="cl">Rejection:</span> No -- the case is, her buttocks are not exposed, but are recessed in the ground.</p>
<p class="bas indent1"><span class="nm">(k)</span><span class="cl">(Beraisa #2):</span> If his sons and household are small, no garment is needed.</p>
<p class="bas indent1"><span class="nm">(l)</span><span class="cl">Question:</span> Until when are they considered small?</p>
<p class="bas indent1"><span class="nm">(m)</span><span class="cl">Version #1 - Answer (Rav Chisda):</span> A girl no older than three years and a boy no older than nine years are small.</p>
<p class="bas indent1"><span class="nm">(n)</span><span class="cl">Version #2 - Answer:</span> A girl no more than eleven years and a boy no more than twelve years are small.</p>
<p class="bas indent2"><span class="nm">1.</span>This is only if "Shadayim Nachonu u'Se'arech Tzime'ach" (they have pubic development).</p>
<p class="bas indent1"><span class="nm">(o)</span><span class="cl">Question (Rav Kahana):</span> Regarding Tefilin on the bed, Rava said that the Halachah follows Shmuel, even though a Beraisa refutes him;</p>
<p class="bas indent2"><span class="nm">1.</span>Does the Halachah follow Shmuel here (regarding Shema)?</p>
<p class="bas indent1"><span class="nm">(p)</span><span class="cl">Rav Ashi:</span> This is not a general rule (that the Halachah always follows Shmuel), you cannot extrapolate to places where it was not said that the Halachah follows him.</p>
<p class="bas indent1"><span class="nm">(q)</span><span class="cl">Question (Rav Mari):</span> If a [pubic] hair sticks out of one's garment, is it like Ervah (to forbid saying Shema)?</p>
<p class="bas indent1"><span class="nm">(r)</span><span class="cl">Answer (Rav Papa):</span> We are not concerned for it.</p>
<p class="bas subject"><span class="nm">3)</span>PRAYING NEAR <i>ERVAH</i></p>
<p class="bas indent1"><span class="nm">(a)</span><span class="cl">(R. Yitzchak):</span> An exposed [square] Tefach of part of a woman's body (that should be covered) is Ervah.</p>
<p class="bas indent1"><span class="nm">(b)</span><span class="cl">Question:</span> Concerning what is it considered Ervah?</p>
<p class="bas indent2"><span class="nm">1.</span><span class="cl">Suggestion:</span> It is forbidden to look at it.</p>
<p class="bas indent2"><span class="nm">2.</span><span class="cl">Rejection:</span> Rav Sheshes taught that [when listing the spoils taken from Midyan] the Torah lists outer ornaments with inner ornaments (that cover the Ervah) to teach that gazing even at a woman's bare finger is like gazing at her Ervah!</p>
<p class="bas indent1"><span class="nm">(c)</span><span class="cl">Answer:</span> Rather, it refers to one's wife -- one may not say Keri'as Shema facing her if a Tefach is exposed.</p>
<p class="bas indent1"><span class="nm">(d)</span><span class="cl">(Rav Chisda):</span> A (Rashi - married) woman's thigh is considered Ervah -- "Gali Shok Ivri Neharos... Tigal Ervasech."</p>
<p class="bas indent1"><span class="nm">(e)</span><span class="cl">(Shmuel):</span> A woman's [singing] voice is Ervah (Shulchan Aruch - for a man not used to it) -- "Ki Kolech Arev" (it arouses desire).</p>
<p class="bas indent1"><span class="nm">(f)</span><span class="cl">(Rav Sheshes):</span> A woman's hair is considered Ervah -- "Sa'arech k'Eder ha'Izim."</p>
<p class="bas subject"><span class="nm">4)</span>RESPECT FOR TEFILIN AND FOR PRAYER</p>
<p class="bas indent1"><span class="nm">(a)</span><span class="cl">(R. Chanina):</span> I saw Rebbi hang his Tefilin (on a peg).</p>
<p class="bas indent1"><span class="nm">(b)</span><span class="cl">Question (Beraisa):</span> If one hangs his Tefilin, his life will be suspended;</p>
<p class="bas indent2"><span class="nm">1.</span><span class="cl">(Those who expound hidden secrets of the Torah):</span> "V'Hayu Chayecha Telu'im Lecha mi'Neged" -- this is one who hangs his Tefilin.</p>
<p class="bas indent1"><span class="nm">(c)</span><span class="cl">Answer #1:</span> It is disgraceful to hang them from the strap (the boxes hang down), Rebbi hung his from the boxes.</p>
<p class="bas indent1"><span class="nm">(d)</span><span class="cl">Answer #2:</span> It is forbidden to hang them from the strap or boxes; Rebbi hung his Tefilin in their bag.</p>
<p class="bas indent2"><span class="nm">1.</span><span class="cl">Question:</span> If so, why was this act recorded? (Obviously, it was permitted!)</p>
<p class="bas indent2"><span class="nm">2.</span><span class="cl">Answer:</span> One might have thought that Tefilin must rest like a Sefer Torah -- R. Chanina teaches, this is not so.</p>
<p class="bas indent1"><span class="nm">(e)</span><span class="cl">(R. Chanina):</span> I saw Rebbi (during Shemoneh Esreh) belch, yawn, sneeze, spit and use his garment to remove a louse that was biting him (Rashi; Tosfos - he would fix his garment so it would not fall);</p>
<p class="bas indent2"><span class="nm">1.</span>If his Talis fell, he would not put it on again (that is like an interruption);</p>
<p class="bas bbbline">24b----------------------------------------24b</p>
<p class="bas indent2"><span class="nm">2.</span>When he would yawn, he would put his hand on his chin (to cover his mouth).</p>
<p class="bas indent1"><span class="nm">(f)</span><span class="cl">Question (Beraisa):</span> One who prays audibly has little Emunah;</p>
<p class="bas indent2"><span class="nm">1.</span>One who raises his voice in prayer is like a false prophet;</p>
<p class="bas indent2"><span class="nm">2.</span>One who belches or yawns (in prayer) is haughty;</p>
<p class="bas indent2"><span class="nm">3.</span>Sneezing is a bad sign; some say that it shows that he is repulsive.</p>
<p class="bas indent2"><span class="nm">4.</span>Spitting is like spitting in front of the King.</p>
<p class="bas indent1"><span class="nm">(g)</span>We can answer belching and yawning -- these are haughty only if done willfully, Rebbi did so involuntarily;</p>
<p class="bas indent1"><span class="nm">(h)</span><span class="cl">Question:</span> How can we answer for sneezing? (It is always involuntary!)</p>
<p class="bas indent1"><span class="nm">(i)</span><span class="cl">Answer:</span> Rebbi sneezed above (through the mouth), the Beraisa discusses sneezing below (passing wind).</p>
<p class="bas indent2"><span class="nm">1.</span><span class="cl">R. Zeira:</span> I learned the following in Rav Hamnuna's academy, it was as dear to me as all my learning:</p>
<p class="bas indent2"><span class="nm">2.</span>Sneezing during prayer is a good sign; just as Hash-m makes a relief for him below (by causing him to sneeze), He makes a relief for him above (by answering his prayers).</p>
<p class="bas indent1"><span class="nm">(j)</span><span class="cl">Question:</span> How can we answer for spitting?</p>
<p class="bas indent1"><span class="nm">(k)</span><span class="cl">Answer:</span> Presumably, Rebbi did as Rav Yehudah taught:</p>
<p class="bas indent2"><span class="nm">1.</span><span class="cl">(Rav Yehudah):</span> If saliva came into one's mouth during prayer, he should absorb it in his Talis; if he has a nice Talis (and does not want to soil it), he may absorb it in his turban. (The Beraisa discusses spitting on the ground.)</p>
<p class="bas indent1"><span class="nm">(l)</span>Rav Ashi was praying, Ravina was standing in back of him. Saliva came into Rav Ashi's mouth, he expelled it behind him.</p>
<p class="bas indent1"><span class="nm">(m)</span><span class="cl">Ravina:</span> Don't you hold like Rav Yehudah, who permits absorbing it in one's turban?</p>
<p class="bas indent2"><span class="nm">1.</span><span class="cl">Rav Ashi:</span> I am feeble (doing so would upset me).</p>
<p class="bas indent1"><span class="nm">(n)</span><span class="cl">(Beraisa):</span> One who prays audibly has little Emunah.</p>
<p class="bas indent1"><span class="nm">(o)</span><span class="cl">(Rav Huna):</span> This is only if he could concentrate quietly; if not, it is permitted.</p>
<p class="bas indent2"><span class="nm">1.</span>This is only when praying in private, but not in public, for it could disturb others.</p>
<p class="bas indent1"><span class="nm">(p)</span>R. Aba wanted to go to Eretz Yisrael, therefore he was avoiding Rav Yehudah;</p>
<p class="bas indent2"><span class="nm">1.</span><span class="cl">(Rav Yehudah):</span> One who goes from Bavel to Eretz Yisrael transgresses a Mitzvas Aseh -- "Bavelah Yuva'u v'Shamah Yiheyu Ad Yom Pokdi Osam" (Yisrael should remain there until Hash-m redeems them).</p>
<p class="bas indent2"><span class="nm">2.</span>R. Aba decided to listen to another teaching of Rav Yehudah, from outside the Beis Medrash, before leaving.</p>
<p class="bas indent2"><span class="nm">3.</span><span class="cl">Version #1:</span> He found a Tana (reciter of Beraisos) saying in front of Rav Yehudah, "If one passes wind during prayer, he should wait until the odor dissipates, and then resume praying."</p>
<p class="bas indent2"><span class="nm">4.</span><span class="cl">Version #2 (Tana):</span> "If one feels a need to emit gas during prayer, he walks back four Amos, passes wind, waits for the odor to go away, returns to [Rashi - the place of] his Tefilah and says 'Hashem... You created us full of orifices... our shame is revealed in front of You...";</p>
<p class="bas indent3"><span class="nm">i.</span>He resumes praying from where he left off.</p>
<p class="bas indent2"><span class="nm">5.</span><span class="cl">R. Aba:</span> It was worth coming just to hear this!</p>
<p class="bas indent1"><span class="nm">(q)</span><span class="cl">(Beraisa):</span> If one was sleeping in [only] his Talis and it is too cold to stick out his head (to say Shema), he should press his Talis on his neck (to separate between his eyes and his Ervah);</p>
<p class="bas indent1"><span class="nm">(r)</span>Some say, he should press it on his heart.</p>
<p class="bas indent1"><span class="nm">(s)</span><span class="cl">Question:</span> According to the first Tana, there is no separation between his heart and his Ervah!</p>
<p class="bas indent1"><span class="nm">(t)</span><span class="cl">Answer:</span> He holds that no separation is needed between them.</p>

<p class="bas indent1"><span class="nm">(a)</span><span class="cl">Version #1 (Rav Huna citing R. Yochanan):</span> If one was walking in a filthy alley (at the time of Shema), he should put his hand over his mouth and say Shema.</p>

<p class="bas indent1"><span class="nm">(c)</span><span class="cl">Version #2:</span> Rabah bar bar Chanah said this in the name of Reish Lakish; Rav Chisda said that he would not follow it even if he heard it from Reish Lakish himself.</p>
<p class="bas indent1"><span class="nm">(d)</span><span class="cl">Question:</span> Rav Huna could not have said this!</p>
<p class="bas indent2"><span class="nm">1.</span><span class="cl">(Rav Huna):</span> It is forbidden for a Chacham to stand in a filthy place, for he cannot avoid thinking about Torah.</p>
<p class="bas indent1"><span class="nm">(e)</span><span class="cl">Answer:</span> He may not <i>stand</i> in a filthy place, but he may walk through it while thinking about Torah.</p>
<p class="bas indent1"><span class="nm">(f)</span><span class="cl">Question:</span> R. Yochanan could not have said this!</p>
<p class="bas indent2"><span class="nm">1.</span><span class="cl">(R. Yochanan):</span> It is permitted to think about Torah anywhere except for the bathhouse or Beis ha'Kisei (or other filthy places).</p>
<p class="bas indent1"><span class="nm">(g)</span><span class="cl">Answer:</span> He forbids one who stands in a filthy place, but he permits one who walks through.</p>
<p class="bas indent1"><span class="nm">(h)</span><span class="cl">Objection:</span> R. Avahu was walking behind R. Yochanan and saying Keri'as Shema. He came to a filthy alley and stopped; later, he asked where to resume;</p>

<p class="bas indent2"><span class="nm">1.</span>I hold that one who walks through need not stop. According to you, who holds that one must stop, if you paused long enough to finish, you resume from the beginning.</p>
