<div class="subject"><span class="nm">1)</span><p>CAN A <i>YAVAM</i> SELL THE PROPERTY OF THE DECEASED? (cont.)</p></div>
<div class="indent1"><span class="nm">(a)</span><p><span class="cl">Answer:</span> Rather, the Beraisa is erroneous because we do not find a Tana who agrees with two stringencies (favoring collection) of a Kesuvah:</p></div>
<div class="indent2"><span class="nm">1.</span><p>We find only R. Meir (who allows collecting it from Metaltelim) or R. Nasan (who allows collecting it from one who owes the husband).</p></div>
<div class="indent1"><span class="nm">(b)</span><p><span class="cl">Rava:</span> Now I understand why I heard Abaye say 'This Beraisa is erroneous.'</p></div>
<div class="indent1"><span class="nm">(c)</span><p>A woman fell to Yibum. Moshe planned to give to her a Get, to prevent his older brother Aharon from doing Yibum.</p></div>
<div class="indent2"><span class="nm">1.</span><p><span class="cl">Aharon:</span> Do you seek to prevent me from inheriting our brother's property myself? I will split it with you!</p></div>
<div class="indent2"><span class="nm">2.</span><p><span class="cl">Moshe:</span> I fear that you will do like the trickster of Pumbedisa (81b, who later retracted)!</p></div>
<div class="indent2"><span class="nm">3.</span><p><span class="cl">Aharon:</span> If you want, I will divide the property with you now!</p></div>
<div class="indent1"><span class="nm">(d)</span><p><span class="cl">(Mar bar Rav Ashi):</span> Here, the division is void. This case is unlike R. Yochanan's law:</p></div>
<div class="indent2"><span class="nm">1.</span><p><span class="cl">(Rav Dimi citing R. Yochanan):</span> If Reuven told Shimon 'do Meshichah (take it to your premises) on this cow, but it is not yours until 30 days from now', 30 days later he acquires it, even if it is in a swamp. (It is not in the buyer's Reshus, but Meshichah works there.)</p></div>
<div class="indent2"><span class="nm">2.</span><p>There, Reuven could give the cow now. Here, the Yavam cannot give the property (until he does Yibum and inherits it).</p></div>
<div class="indent1"><span class="nm">(e)</span><p><span class="cl">Contradiction (Ravin citing R. Yochanan):</span> The cow is not acquired 30 days later.</p></div>
<div class="indent1"><span class="nm">(f)</span><p><span class="cl">Answer:</span> Rav Dimi discusses when he said 'acquire from now.' In Ravin's case, he did not say this.</p></div>
<div class="indent1"><span class="nm">(g)</span><p><span class="cl">Question #1:</span> If he did Yibum and then divided the property, is the division valid?</p></div>
<div class="indent1"><span class="nm">(h)</span><p><span class="cl">Answer (Ula):</span> No. (This is like Rav Yosef above.)</p></div>
<div class="indent1"><span class="nm">(i)</span><p><span class="cl">Question #2:</span> If he divided the property and then did Yibum, is the division valid?</p></div>
<div class="indent1"><span class="nm">(j)</span><p><span class="cl">Answer (Ula):</span> No.</p></div>
<div class="indent2"><span class="nm">1.</span><p><span class="cl">Question:</span> If it is invalid after Yibum, we need not ask about before Yibum!</p></div>
<div class="indent2"><span class="nm">2.</span><p><span class="cl">Answer:</span> These questions were asked in cases that arose. (The second questioner had not heard the first answer.)</p></div>
<div class="indent1"><span class="nm">(k)</span><p><span class="cl">(Ravin):</span> Whether he divided the property before or after doing Yibum, the division is void.</p></div>
<div class="indent1"><span class="nm">(l)</span><p>This is the Halachah.</p></div>
<div class="indent1"><span class="nm">(m)</span><p><span class="cl">(Mishnah - Chachamim):</span> Attached produce is his.</p></div>
<div class="indent1"><span class="nm">(n)</span><p><span class="cl">Question:</span> Why is this? There is a lien on all (attached) property of the Mes to pay the Kesuvah!</p></div>
<div class="indent1"><span class="nm">(o)</span><p><span class="cl">Correction (Reish Lakish):</span> The Mishnah should say 'it is hers'.</p></div>
<div class="subject"><span class="nm">2)</span><p>THE RESULTS OF YIBUM</p></div>
<div class="indent1"><span class="nm">(a)</span><p><span class="cl">(Mishnah):</span> If he does Yibum, she is like his wife.</p></div>
<div class="indent1"><span class="nm">(b)</span><p><span class="cl">Question:</span> What does this teach?</p></div>
<div class="indent1"><span class="nm">(c)</span><p><span class="cl">Answer (R. Yosi bar Chanina):</span> It teaches that he may divorce her with a Get and remarry her.</p></div>
<div class="indent1"><span class="nm">(d)</span><p><span class="cl">Objection:</span> Obviously he may divorce her with a Get!</p></div>
<div class="indent1"><span class="nm">(e)</span><p><span class="cl">Answer:</span> One might have thought that "V'Yibmah" teaches that she is still like a Yevamah, and a Get does not suffice to divorce her, rather Chalitzah is needed!</p></div>
<div class="indent2"><span class="nm">1.</span><p>The Mishnah teaches that this is not so.</p></div>
<div class="indent1"><span class="nm">(f)</span><p><span class="cl">Objection:</span> Obviously he may remarry her!</p></div>
<div class="bbbline">82b----------------------------------------82b</p></div>
<div class="indent1"><span class="nm">(g)</span><p><span class="cl">Answer:</span> One might have thought that he did the Mitzvah the Torah imposed upon him, and now she is forbidden due to Eishes Ach;</p></div>
<div class="indent2"><span class="nm">1.</span><p>The Mishnah teaches that this is not so.</p></div>
<div class="indent1"><span class="nm">(h)</span><p><span class="cl">Question:</span> Why don't we say this?</p></div>
<div class="indent1"><span class="nm">(i)</span><p><span class="cl">Answer:</span> "He will take her for a wife" - once he takes her, she is like his wife.</p></div>
<div class="subject"><span class="nm">3)</span><p>THE KESUVAH OF A YEVAMAH</p></div>
<div class="indent1"><span class="nm">(a)</span><p><span class="cl">(Mishnah):</span> However, her Kesuvah is paid from the property of the deceased.</p></div>
<div class="indent1"><span class="nm">(b)</span><p><span class="cl">Question:</span> Why is this?</p></div>
<div class="indent1"><span class="nm">(c)</span><p><span class="cl">Answer:</span> Shamayim caused him to acquire her (so he should not have to pay her Kesuvah from his own property).</p></div>
<div class="indent1"><span class="nm">(d)</span><p>If she cannot collect a Kesuvah from the property of the deceased, she gets it from the Yavam, so it should not be light in his eyes to divorce her.</p></div>
<div class="indent1"><span class="nm">(e)</span><p><span class="cl">(Mishnah):</span> He should not say 'your Kesuvah (is on the table...)'</p></div>
<div class="indent1"><span class="nm">(f)</span><p><span class="cl">Question:</span> Why does the Mishnah continue 'Similarly, a man should not tell his wife...?'</p></div>
<div class="indent1"><span class="nm">(g)</span><p><span class="cl">Answer:</span> One might have thought that regarding a Yevamah one should not designate money, for he did not write 'There is a lien on all property I acquired and will acquire to pay your Kesuvah.' But since one writes this to a regular wife, he may designate, since she is confident of collecting!</p></div>
<div class="indent2"><span class="nm">1.</span><p>The Mishnah teaches that this is not so.</p></div>
<div class="indent1"><span class="nm">(h)</span><p><span class="cl">(Mishnah):</span> If he divorces her, she collects only her Kesuvah (and he may sell the rest of the property).</p></div>
<div class="indent1"><span class="nm">(i)</span><p>This is only after he divorces her. Before this, he may not sell any property (lest it be needed to pay her Kesuvah), like R. Aba taught (81a).</p></div>
<div class="indent1"><span class="nm">(j)</span><p><span class="cl">(Mishnah):</span> If he remarries her, she is like any woman, and collects only her (original) Kesuvah.</p></div>
<div class="indent1"><span class="nm">(k)</span><p><span class="cl">Question:</span> Why is this needed? Another Mishnah (89b) teaches this!</p></div>
<div class="indent2"><span class="nm">1.</span><p><span class="cl">(Mishnah):</span> If one divorced his wife and remarried her, it is understood that he remarries her on condition that she has only her original Kesuvah.</p></div>
<div class="indent1"><span class="nm">(l)</span><p><span class="cl">Answer:</span> One might have thought that this is only regarding a regular wife, since he wrote the original Kesuvah, but a Yavam, who did not write the original Kesuvah, must now write an additional Kesuvah (it had no lien against his own property), must now write a Kesuvah against his own property;</p></div>
<div class="indent2"><span class="nm">1.</span><p>The Mishnah teaches that this is not so.</p></div>
<div class="subject"><span class="nm">4)</span><p>THE ENACTMENT TO COLLECT A KESUVAH FROM ALL PROPERTY</p></div>
<div class="indent1"><span class="nm">(a)</span><p><span class="cl">(Rav Yehudah):</span> Initially, there was no lien on property to pay a Kesuvah. Men did not find women to marry, until Shimon ben Shetach enacted a lien on all a man's property to pay the Kesuvah.</p></div>
<div class="indent1"><span class="nm">(b)</span><p><span class="cl">Support (Beraisa):</span> Initially, there was no lien on property to pay a Kesuvah. Men did not find women to marry;</p></div>
<div class="indent2"><span class="nm">1.</span><p>They enacted that he leave the Kesuvah (100 or 200 Zuz) in her father's house.</p></div>
<div class="indent2"><span class="nm">2.</span><p>This caused that when a man got angry at his wife, he would divorce her (since the money was out of his hands anyway).</p></div>
<div class="indent2"><span class="nm">3.</span><p>They enacted that he leave the Kesuvah in his father's house. The Kesuvah would be a silver or gold basket for rich wives, or a copper basket for poor wives.</p></div>
<div class="indent2"><span class="nm">4.</span><p>Still, when he got angry at his wife, he would divorce her (since he could not use the Kli anyway).</p></div>
<div class="indent1"><span class="nm">(c)</span><p>Shimon ben Shetach enacted a lien on all a man's property to pay the Kesuvah.</p></div>
