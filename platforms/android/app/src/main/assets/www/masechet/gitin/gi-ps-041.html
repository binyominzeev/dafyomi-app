<p class="bas subject"><span class="nm">1)</span>HOW DO WE EXPLAIN THE MISHNAH?</p>
<p class="bas indent1"><span class="nm">(a)</span><span class="cl">Question:</span> What do they argue about?</p>
<p class="bas indent1"><span class="nm">(b)</span><span class="cl">Answer:</span> They argue about whether or not Reuven must compensate Shimon for damaging property on which Shimon had a lien;</p>
<p class="bas indent2"><span class="nm">1.</span>Chachamim exempt him, and R. Shimon ben Gamliel obligates him.</p>
<p class="bas indent1"><span class="nm">(c)</span><span class="cl">Support:</span> It was taught that Chachamim and R. Shimon ben Gamliel argue about whether or not one who damages collateral for a loan must pay the lender.</p>
<p class="bas indent1"><span class="nm">(d)</span><span class="cl">Answer #2 (to question 6:c, 40b - Ula):</span> Shimon declared Tavi to be free;</p>
<p class="bas indent2"><span class="nm">1.</span>Letter of the law, Tavi is not obligated in the Mitzvos (special to free men) at all. However, since he was called free, for Tikun ha'Olam it was enacted that Reuven free him, and Tavi obligates himself to pay his value to Reuven.</p>
<p class="bas indent2"><span class="nm">2.</span>R. Shimon ben Gamliel says, Shimon owes the money.</p>
<p class="bas indent1"><span class="nm">(e)</span><span class="cl">Question:</span> What do they argue about?</p>
<p class="bas indent1"><span class="nm">(f)</span><span class="cl">Answer:</span> They argue about damage that it not recognizable;</p>
<p class="bas indent2"><span class="nm">1.</span>Chachamim hold that it is not considered damage (so one is exempt). R. Shimon ben Gamliel holds that it is considered damage (one is liable for it).</p>
<p class="bas indent1"><span class="nm">(g)</span><span class="cl">Question:</span> Why didn't Ula answer like Rav?</p>
<p class="bas indent1"><span class="nm">(h)</span><span class="cl">Answer:</span> You cannot say that Shimon is called the master (he never received the slave!)</p>
<p class="bas indent1"><span class="nm">(i)</span><span class="cl">Question:</span> Why didn't Rav answer like Ula?</p>
<p class="bas indent1"><span class="nm">(j)</span><span class="cl">Answer:</span> You cannot say that Shimon freed him. (Since he was not the master, his words had no effect!)</p>
<p class="bas subject"><span class="nm">2)</span>WHEN ONE CANNOT COLLECT FROM AN <i>APOTIKI</i></p>
<p class="bas indent1"><span class="nm">(a)</span><span class="cl">(Ami Shapir Na'eh):</span> If Levi made his field an Apotiki (a property specially designated for collection of a loan) and it was flooded, the lender does not collect from other property.</p>
<p class="bas indent1"><span class="nm">(b)</span><span class="cl">Objection (Rav Nachman bar Yitzchak):</span> This is wrong!</p>
<p class="bas indent1"><span class="nm">(c)</span><span class="cl">Answer:</span> The case is, Levi specified that the loan can be collected only from this field.</p>
<p class="bas indent1"><span class="nm">(d)</span><span class="cl">Support (Beraisa):</span> If Levi made his field an Apotiki, and it was flooded, the lender collects from other property. If Levi specified that the loan can be collected only from this field, it is not collected from other property.</p>
<p class="bas indent1"><span class="nm">(e)</span><span class="cl">(Beraisa):</span> If Yehudah made his field an Apotiki to a creditor or to pay his wife's Kesuvah, they may collect from other property;</p>
<p class="bas indent1"><span class="nm">(f)</span>R. Shimon ben Gamliel says, the creditor may collect from other property, but his wife cannot, for women do not normally go to Beis Din to collect. (Therefore, we assume that the lien of the Kesuvah was levied only on the designated field.)</p>
<p class="bas subject"><span class="nm">3)</span>THE ENACTMENT FOR A HALF-SLAVE</p>
<p class="bas indent1"><span class="nm">(a)</span><span class="cl">(Mishnah - Beis Hillel):</span> A half-slave alternates. One day he serves his master, and the next day, he keeps his earnings;</p>
<p class="bas indent1"><span class="nm">(b)</span><span class="cl">Beis Shamai:</span> That is good for his master, but not for the half-slave!</p>
<p class="bas indent2"><span class="nm">1.</span>He cannot marry a Shifchah, for he is half-free. He cannot marry a Bas Yisrael, for he is half-slave;</p>
<p class="bas bbbline">41b----------------------------------------41b</p>
<p class="bas indent2"><span class="nm">2.</span><span class="cl">Suggestion:</span> He will never marry.</p>
<p class="bas indent2"><span class="nm">3.</span><span class="cl">Rejection:</span> "Lasheves Yetzarah" (the world was created for the sake of procreation)!</p>
<p class="bas indent2"><span class="nm">4.</span>Rather, for Tikun ha'Olam, we force his master to free him, and the half-slave writes a document obligating himself to pay half his value to his master.</p>
<p class="bas indent1"><span class="nm">(c)</span>Beis Hillel retracted, and agreed to Beis Shamai.</p>
<p class="bas subject"><span class="nm">4)</span>CAN ONE FREE HALF OF A SLAVE?</p>
<p class="bas indent1"><span class="nm">(a)</span><span class="cl">(Gemara - Beraisa - Rebbi):</span> If Reuven freed half of his slave, the slave becomes half-free;</p>
<p class="bas indent1"><span class="nm">(b)</span>Chachamim say, he remains a full slave.</p>
<p class="bas indent1"><span class="nm">(c)</span><span class="cl">Opinion #1 (Rabah):</span> They argue about when Reuven gave a Get of (half) freedom.</p>
<p class="bas indent2"><span class="nm">1.</span>Rebbi holds that "she was not redeemed, her Get of freedom was not given to her" equates a Get of freedom to (redemption) money;</p>
<p class="bas indent3"><span class="nm">i.</span>Just like money can fully or partially redeem a slave, also a Get of freedom.</p>
<p class="bas indent2"><span class="nm">2.</span>Chachamim learn from a Gezeirah Shavah "Lah-Lah" from divorce;</p>
<p class="bas indent3"><span class="nm">i.</span>Just like a woman cannot be half-divorced, a slave cannot be half-freed.</p>
<p class="bas indent2"><span class="nm">3.</span>All agree that money can partially free her.</p>
<p class="bas indent2"><span class="nm">4.</span><span class="cl">Suggestion:</span> Rebbi and Chachamim argue about whether it is better to learn from a Hekesh (we equate matters written next to each other) or a Gezeirah Shavah.</p>
<p class="bas indent2"><span class="nm">5.</span><span class="cl">Rejection:</span> No. All agree that usually, a Gezeirah Shavah is better;</p>
<p class="bas indent3"><span class="nm">i.</span>Here is different. A woman cannot be divorced through money (which can partially free a slave), so we do not learn from divorce that a Get of freedom cannot work half-way.</p>
<p class="bas indent1"><span class="nm">(d)</span><span class="cl">Opinion #2 (Rav Yosef):</span> They argue about a slave who was half-redeemed through money;</p>
<p class="bas indent2"><span class="nm">1.</span>Rebbi holds that "redeemed, she was not redeemed" teaches that she was partially redeemed;</p>
<p class="bas indent2"><span class="nm">2.</span>Chachamim say, the Torah speaks like people do (so we need not expound the doubled verb).</p>
<p class="bas indent2"><span class="nm">3.</span>All agree that a Get of half-freedom does not work at all.</p>
<p class="bas indent1"><span class="nm">(e)</span><span class="cl">Question (against Rav Yosef - Beraisa - Rebbi):</span> If one half-freed his slave through a Get, it works;</p>
<p class="bas indent2"><span class="nm">1.</span>Chachamim say, it does not.</p>
<p class="bas indent2"><span class="nm">2.</span>Rav Yosef is refuted. (He said that all agree that a Get does not work half-way.)</p>
<p class="bas indent1"><span class="nm">(f)</span><span class="cl">Suggestion:</span> (Rav Yosef said that they argue about whether or not money can half-redeem.) The Beraisa also refutes him regarding this!</p>
<p class="bas indent2"><span class="nm">1.</span>They argue about a Get. This implies that all agree that money works!</p>
<p class="bas indent1"><span class="nm">(g)</span><span class="cl">Rejection:</span> No, they argue about both.</p>
<p class="bas indent2"><span class="nm">1.</span>The Beraisa discusses a Get to show the extremity of Rebbi, that even a Get works half-way.</p>
<p class="bas indent2"><span class="nm">2.</span><span class="cl">Question:</span> Rather, they should argue about money, to show the extremity of Chachamim, that even money does not work half-way!</p>
<p class="bas indent2"><span class="nm">3.</span><span class="cl">Answer:</span> The Tana prefers to teach the extremity of the lenient opinion.</p>
<p class="bas indent1"><span class="nm">(h)</span><span class="cl">(Beraisa) Suggestion:</span> Perhaps "she was redeemed" totally!</p>
<p class="bas indent1"><span class="nm">(i)</span><span class="cl">Rejection:</span> "She was not redeemed."</p>
<p class="bas indent1"><span class="nm">(j)</span><span class="cl">Suggestion:</span> Perhaps "she was not redeemed" at all!</p>
<p class="bas indent1"><span class="nm">(k)</span><span class="cl">Rejection:</span> "She was redeemed."</p>
<p class="bas indent1"><span class="nm">(l)</span><span class="cl">Resolution:</span> She was partially redeemed, with money or something of value;</p>
<p class="bas indent1"><span class="nm">(m)</span><span class="cl">Suggestion:</span> Perhaps freedom can be only through money!</p>
<p class="bas indent1"><span class="nm">(n)</span><span class="cl">Rejection:</span> It says "or her freedom was not given Lah (to her)", and "he will write Lah (for her) a Sefer of divorce." A Gezeirah Shavah "Lah-Lah" teaches that one can free a slave through a document.</p>
<p class="bas indent1"><span class="nm">(o)</span><span class="cl">Question:</span> We learned that money can partially redeem, and a Get can totally free a slave. What is the source that a Get can free half-way?</p>
<p class="bas indent1"><span class="nm">(p)</span><span class="cl">Answer:</span> "She was redeemed... her freedom" equates freedom through money and a through a document. Either can work fully or partially.</p>
<p class="bas indent1"><span class="nm">(q)</span>After Rav Yosef was refuted (about one matter), he will say that this Beraisa is like Rebbi (but Chachamim hold that even money cannot half-redeem.)</p>
<p class="bas indent1"><span class="nm">(r)</span><span class="cl">Question:</span> According to Rabah, the Reisha is like all the Tana'im, but the Seifa is only like Rebbi!</p>
<p class="bas indent1"><span class="nm">(s)</span><span class="cl">Answer #1 (Rabah):</span> Yes, that is the structure of the Beraisa.</p>
<p class="bas indent1"><span class="nm">(t)</span><span class="cl">Answer #2 (Rav Ashi):</span> Rebbi taught the entire Beraisa. Chachamim agree to his first law, and argue with his second law.</p>
