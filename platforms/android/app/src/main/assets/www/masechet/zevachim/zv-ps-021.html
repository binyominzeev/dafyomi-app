<div class="indent1"><span class="nm">(a)</span><p><span class="cl">Answer #2:</span> R. Chiya b'Rebbi Yosef taught that those who will engage in the Parah Adumah are Mekadesh in a Keli Shares in the Mikdash, then go outside. R. Yochanan says they may Mekadesh outside, even in a Chulin Keli, even if it is earthenware.</p></div>
<div class="indent2"><span class="nm">1.</span><p>Even though we are Metamei the one who will burn the Parah Adumah, he does not need a second Kidush!</p></div>
<div class="indent3"><span class="nm">i.</span><p><span class="cl">(Mishnah):</span> They would Metamei the Kohen who will burn the Parah Adumah, then he would immerse, to disprove the Tzedukim, who said that a Tevul Yom is Pasul for the Parah Adumah.</p></div>
<div class="indent1"><span class="nm">(b)</span><p><span class="cl">Rejection:</span> The Parah Adumah is different. Since a Tevul Yom is Kosher for its Avodah, Tum'ah does not disqualify Kidush.</p></div>
<div class="indent1"><span class="nm">(c)</span><p><span class="cl">Question:</span> If so, why must he be Mekadesh at all?</p></div>
<div class="indent1"><span class="nm">(d)</span><p><span class="cl">Answer:</span> It must resemble Avodah.</p></div>
<div class="subject"><span class="nm">2)</span><p><i>KIDUSH</i> INSIDE THE <i>KIYOR</i></p></div>
<div class="indent1"><span class="nm">(a)</span><p><span class="cl">Question:</span> May a Kohen be Mekadesh <i>in</i> the Kiyor?</p></div>
<div class="indent2"><span class="nm">1.</span><p>The Torah said that he washes "Mimenu (from it)", not 'b'Socho (in it)';</p></div>
<div class="indent2"><span class="nm">2.</span><p>Or, does this include even in it?</p></div>
<div class="indent1"><span class="nm">(b)</span><p><span class="cl">Answer (Rav Nachman bar Yitzchak - Beraisa):</span> If he immersed his hands in water in a cave, he is Mechalel Avodah.</p></div>
<div class="indent2"><span class="nm">1.</span><p><span class="cl">Inference:</span> If he immersed his hands in the Kiyor, his Avodah is Kosher!</p></div>
<div class="indent1"><span class="nm">(c)</span><p><span class="cl">Rejection:</span> The Beraisa taught about a cave for a Chidush (but not for the inference). One might have thought that since he can immerse his entire body in it, all the more so he can be Mekadesh his hands and feet in it!</p></div>
<div class="subject"><span class="nm">3)</span><p>WHEN DOES THE WATER BECOME DISQUALIFIED?</p></div>
<div class="indent1"><span class="nm">(a)</span><p><span class="cl">(R. Chiya bar Yosef):</span> If a Kohen will offer Matirim (things that permit other things, e.g. Zerikah permits the meat), if water was in the Kiyor at the time (on the previous day) that those Matirim become Pasul (e.g. for Zerikah, sundown), he may not be Mekadesh from that water;</p></div>
<div class="indent2"><span class="nm">1.</span><p>If he will burn Eimurim, he may not be Mekadesh from water that was in the Kiyor at the last time (on the previous day) to burn Eimurim (i.e. dawn).</p></div>
<div class="indent1"><span class="nm">(b)</span><p><span class="cl">(Rav Chisda):</span> Even if he will offer Matirim, the water is Pasul only if it was in the Kiyor at dawn.</p></div>
<div class="indent1"><span class="nm">(c)</span><p><span class="cl">(R. Yochanan):</span> If the Kiyor was submerged, we do not lift it (until morning).</p></div>
<div class="indent1"><span class="nm">(d)</span><p><span class="cl">Inference:</span> The water is Pasul even for Avodah of the night!</p></div>
<div class="indent2"><span class="nm">1.</span><p><span class="cl">Contradiction (Rav Asi citing R. Yochanan citing Ilfa):</span> If the Kiyor was not submerged when night came, its water may be used to be Mekadesh at night. One is not Mekadesh in the morning.</p></div>
<div class="indent1"><span class="nm">(e)</span><p><span class="cl">Answer #1:</span> 'We do not lift it' means that we do not lift it to be Mekadesh for Avodah that is done only by day.</p></div>
<div class="indent1"><span class="nm">(f)</span><p><span class="cl">Question:</span> This implies that the water is Kosher for Avodah of the night;</p></div>
<div class="indent2"><span class="nm">1.</span><p>If so, R. Yochanan agrees with R. Chiya bar Yosef!</p></div>
<div class="bbbline">21b----------------------------------------21b</p></div>
<div class="indent1"><span class="nm">(g)</span><p><span class="cl">Answer:</span> They argue about whether Chachamim decreed about submerging. (Tosfos (Mai) - the Kiyor must be submerged all night, lest people think that it was submerged before sundown in order that one may Mekadesh from it even to offer Matirim (like Rav Chisda holds); Tosfos (Hagahah) - if it was not submerged, R. Yochanan says that the water is Pasul mid'Rabanan, and R. Chiya bar Yosef disqualifies mid'Oraisa; Rashi - they decreed not to lift the Kiyor at night, lest it not be submerged again before dawn, then the water will become Pasul. R. Yochanan really holds like Rav Chisda.)</p></div>
<div class="indent1"><span class="nm">(h)</span><p><span class="cl">Question:</span> R. Yochanan taught that if a Kohen was Mekadesh for Terumas ha'Deshen, he need not be Mekadesh again after dawn, for Terumas ha'Deshen starts the Avodah of the coming day!</p></div>
<div class="indent2"><span class="nm">1.</span><p>This is not difficult for Rava, who said that this is according to R. Elazar b'Rebbi Shimon. Here, R. Yochanan discusses (submerging the Kiyor) according to Rebbi. (Some say that R. Elazar says that Linah disqualifies water.)</p></div>
<div class="indent2"><span class="nm">2.</span><p>However, Abaye said that R. Yochanan's teaching about Terumas ha'Deshen is like Rebbi. If so, Rebbi contradicts himself!</p></div>
<div class="indent3"><span class="nm">i.</span><p>Here, he decrees that the Kiyor must be submerged. There, he does not decree (after Terumas ha'Deshen)!</p></div>
<div class="indent1"><span class="nm">(i)</span><p><span class="cl">Answer:</span> Indeed, also there the Kiyor must be submerged after Terumas ha'Deshen.</p></div>
<div class="indent1"><span class="nm">(j)</span><p><span class="cl">Question:</span> If so, why did R. Yochanan say that one is not Mekadesh in the morning?</p></div>
<div class="indent1"><span class="nm">(k)</span><p><span class="cl">Answer:</span> He meant that one need not be Mekadesh in the morning.</p></div>
<div class="indent1"><span class="nm">(l)</span><p><span class="cl">Question:</span> If so, R. Yochanan agrees with Rav Chisda!</p></div>
<div class="indent1"><span class="nm">(m)</span><p><span class="cl">Answer:</span> They argue about when the Kiyor must be submerged. (R. Yochanan says that we submerge it at night, so they will remember to submerge it after Terumas ha'Deshen. Rav Chisda says that it suffices to submerge it after Terumas ha'Deshen).</p></div>
<div class="indent1"><span class="nm">(n)</span><p><span class="cl">Question (against this understanding of Rav Chisda - Mishnah):</span> The other Kohanim would not see (the Kohen doing Terumas ha'Deshen, for it was before dawn), nor would they hear him until they would hear the wood of the pulley that Ben Katin made for the Kiyor;</p></div>
<div class="indent2"><span class="nm">1.</span><p>They would say 'the time has come to be Mekadesh from the Kiyor!'</p></div>
<div class="indent2"><span class="nm">2.</span><p><span class="cl">Suggestion:</span> They heard him lifting the Kiyor from the pit!</p></div>
<div class="indent1"><span class="nm">(o)</span><p><span class="cl">Answer:</span> No, they heard him lowering it into the pit.</p></div>
<div class="indent1"><span class="nm">(p)</span><p><span class="cl">Question:</span> The pulley is not needed for that!</p></div>
<div class="indent1"><span class="nm">(q)</span><p><span class="cl">Answer:</span> He would lower it with the pulley in order to make noise to arouse the other Kohanim.</p></div>
<div class="indent1"><span class="nm">(r)</span><p><span class="cl">Question:</span> There was a man (Gevini) who would cry out to arouse the Kohanim!</p></div>
<div class="indent1"><span class="nm">(s)</span><p><span class="cl">Answer:</span> It is better to arouse them twice. Perhaps they will hear one and not the other.</p></div>
