<p class="bas indent1"><span class="nm">(a)</span>The people of Sedom have no share in the world to come. They were "Ra'im" in this world, and "Chata'im (which means lacking)" in the world to come, but they will be judged;</p>
<p class="bas indent1"><span class="nm">(b)</span>R. Nechemyah says, also they will not be judged:</p>
<p class="bas indent2"><span class="nm">1.</span>"Lo Yakumu Resha'im ba'Mishpat" is Dor ha'Mabul;</p>
<p class="bas indent2"><span class="nm">2.</span>"V'Chata'im ba'Adas Tzadikim" are the people of Sedom.</p>
<p class="bas indent1"><span class="nm">(c)</span><span class="cl">Chachamim:</span> They will not stand in the congregation of Tzadikim, but they will stand (to be judged) in the congregation of Resha'im.</p>
<p class="bas indent1"><span class="nm">(d)</span>The Meraglim have no share in the world to come:</p>
<p class="bas indent2"><span class="nm">1.</span>"Va'Yamusu" in this world, and "...ba'Magefah" (Maharsha - this is written much later in the verse, therefore it refers to a different death) in the world to come.</p>
<p class="bas indent1"><span class="nm">(e)</span>R. Akiva says, Dor (the generation that died in) ha'Midbar has no share in the world to come - "Ba'Midbar ha'Zeh Yitamu v'Sham Yamusu";</p>
<p class="bas indent1"><span class="nm">(f)</span>R. Eliezer says, they have a share - "Isfu Li Chasidai..."</p>
<p class="bas indent1"><span class="nm">(g)</span>Rebbi Akiva says the congregation of (i.e. those swallowed with) Korach will never rise - "va'Tchas Aleihem ha'Aretz" in this world, and "va'Yovdu mi'Toch ha'Kahal" in the world to come.</p>
<p class="bas indent1"><span class="nm">(h)</span>R. Eliezer says, (they will rise -) "Hashem Memis u'Mechayeh Morid She'ol va'Ya'al."</p>
<p class="bas subject"><span class="nm">2)</span>DOR HA'MABUL</p>
<p class="bas indent1"><span class="nm">(a)</span><span class="cl">(Gemara - Beraisa - R. Akiva):</span> Dor ha'Mabul has no share in the world to come:</p>
<p class="bas indent2"><span class="nm">1.</span>"Va'Yimach Es Kol ha'Yekum" - in this world. "Va'Yimachu Min ha'Aretz" in the world to come;</p>
<p class="bas indent2"><span class="nm">2.</span>R. Yehudah ben Beseira says, they will not live, and they will not be judged. "Lo Yadun Ruchi va'Adam l'Olam" - there will be neither Din nor Ru'ach;</p>
<p class="bas indent3"><span class="nm">i.</span>Alternatively - their Neshamos will not return to the holders (their bodies).</p>
<p class="bas indent2"><span class="nm">3.</span>R. Menachem b'Rebbi Yosef says, even when Hash-m returns Neshamos to dead bodies, their Neshamos will burn their bodies - "Ruchachem Esh Tochalchem."</p>
<p class="bas indent1"><span class="nm">(b)</span><span class="cl">(Beraisa):</span> Dor ha'Mabul became haughty because Hash-m bestowed good on them - "Bateihem Shalom mi'Pachad v'Lo Shevet Eloka Aleihem... b'Sof v'Chinor v'Yismechu l'Kol Ugav Yechalu Yemeihem va'Tov Yemeihem uv'Rega She'ol Yechatu";</p>
<p class="bas indent2"><span class="nm">1.</span>This caused them to tell Hash-m "Sur Mimenu v'Da'as Derachecha Lo Chofatznu Mah Shakai Ki Na'avdenu" - we rely on Hash-m only for rain, and even this is not essential. We can get water from rivers and springs!</p>
<p class="bas indent2"><span class="nm">2.</span><span class="cl">Hash-m:</span> They anger Me with the good I bestowed on them. I will punish them with it - "Hineni Mevi Es ha'Mabul Mayim."</p>
<p class="bas indent1"><span class="nm">(c)</span>R. Yosi says, they became haughty because they went after their eyes (Maharsha - instead of closing them when they should have), which are like water - "va'Yikchu Lahem Nashim mi'Kol Asher Bocharu";</p>
<p class="bas indent2"><span class="nm">1.</span>Therefore, Hash-m punished them by (uncovering) water (that comes out from a source narrow) like eyes - "Nivke'u Kol Maynos Tehom Rabah va'Arubos ha'Shamayim Niftachu."</p>
<p class="bas indent1"><span class="nm">(d)</span><span class="cl">(R. Yochanan):</span> "Rabah Ra'as ha'Adam" - because the sin of Dor ha'Mabul was Rabah (great), they were punished accordingly - "Nivke'u Kol Maynos Tehom Rabah."</p>
<p class="bas indent1"><span class="nm">(e)</span><span class="cl">(R. Yochanan):</span> Three springs were left open after the flood - Blo'ah of Gader, the hot spring of Tiverya, and the great spring of Biram.</p>
<p class="bas indent1"><span class="nm">(f)</span><span class="cl">(R. Yochanan):</span> "Ki Hishchis Kol Basar Es Darcho" - they would mate Behemos and Chayos, and people would mate with everything.</p>
<p class="bas indent2"><span class="nm">1.</span><span class="cl">(R. Aba bar Kahana):</span> All the animals ceased to do so, except for Tushlami (water rail, a bird that to this day mates with other species).</p>
<p class="bas indent1"><span class="nm">(g)</span><span class="cl">(R. Yochanan):</span> Theft is very severe. Dor ha'Mabul transgressed everything, yet their decree was sealed only due to theft -  "Ki Mol'ah ha'Aretz Chamas Mipneihem v'Hineni Mashchisam Es ha'Aretz";</p>
<p class="bas indent2"><span class="nm">1.</span>R. Eliezer "He'Chamas Kam l'Mate Resha Lo Mehem v'Lo me'Hamonam v'Lo me'Hemehem ..." - theft itself stood up in front of Hash-m and said that there are no redeeming qualities in the people or their Kinyanim.</p>
<p class="bas indent1"><span class="nm">(h)</span><span class="cl">(Tana d'Vei R. Yishmael):</span> The decree was sealed even on Noach - "Nichamti Ki Asisim <i>v'Noach</i>";</p>
<p class="bas indent2"><span class="nm">1.</span>He was spared because he found grace in Hash-m's eyes - "(v'Noach) Motza Chen b'Einei Hash-m."</p>
<p class="bas indent1"><span class="nm">(i)</span><span class="cl">Version #1 (Rav Dimi):</span> "Va'Yinachem Hash-m Ki Osah Es ha'Adam ba'Aretz" - Hash-m consoled Himself that He made graves for people in the ground (Rashi - that He brought the flood; Ramah - when Hash-m decreed death on Adam ha'Rishon, He said that man would return to the dirt. Had He brought a flood instead, Noach would not have come to the world!)</p>
<p class="bas indent1"><span class="nm">(j)</span><span class="cl">Question:</span> How does the verse teach this?</p>
<p class="bas indent1"><span class="nm">(k)</span><span class="cl">Answer:</span> It says here "va'Yinachem", as it says about Yosef (comforting his brothers that he will not harm them) "va'Yinachem Osam va'Ydaber Al Libam."</p>
<p class="bas indent1"><span class="nm">(l)</span><span class="cl">Version #2:</span> Hash-m 'regretted' that He made graves for people in the ground;</p>
<p class="bas indent2"><span class="nm">1.</span>It says here "va'Yinachem", as it says about Hash-m's intent to destroy Yisrael due to the Egel, "va'Yinachem Hash-m Al ha'Ra'ah Asher Diber La'asos l'Amo."</p>
<p class="bas indent1"><span class="nm">(m)</span><span class="cl">(R. Yochanan):</span> "Noach Ish Tzadik Tamim Hayah b'Dorosav" - he was a Tzadik in his generations, but had he lived in generations with big Tzadikim, he would not have been considered a Tzadik.</p>
<p class="bas indent2"><span class="nm">1.</span><span class="cl">(R. Chanina):</span> A parable explains this. A barrel of wine among barrels of vinegar gives a good smell. Elsewhere, one does not appreciate the smell.</p>
<p class="bas indent1"><span class="nm">(n)</span><span class="cl">(Reish Lakish):</span> All the more so, had he lived among big Tzadikim he would have (learned from them and) been a bigger Tzadik!</p>
<p class="bas indent1"><span class="nm">(o)</span><span class="cl">(R. Oshaya):</span> A parable explains this. A flask of perfume in a foul-smelling area gives a good smell, and all the more so it would do so amidst perfumes!</p>
<p class="bas subject"><span class="nm">3)</span>THE FLOOD</p>
<p class="bas indent1"><span class="nm">(a)</span><span class="cl">Question:</span> "Va'Yimach Es Kol ha'Yekum Asher Al Penei ha'Adamah" - since the people sinned, why were the animals punished?</p>
<p class="bas indent1"><span class="nm">(b)</span><span class="cl">Answer (R. Yehoshua ben Korchah):</span> A parable explains this. A man made a wedding feast for his son, and prepared many foods. His son died, so he strewed them about. Without his son, he has no need for them;</p>
<p class="bas indent2"><span class="nm">1.</span>Likewise, the animals were only for the sake of man. Now that man would be destroyed, there is no need for animals.</p>
<p class="bas indent1"><span class="nm">(c)</span>"Be'Charavah Mesu", but fish did not die.</p>
<p class="bas indent1"><span class="nm">(d)</span><span class="cl">(R. Yosi of Kisri):</span> "Kal Hu Al Penei Mayim..." - Noach told his generation that if they do not repent, Hash-m will bring a flood, and your bodies will float on the water like pouches;</p>
<p class="bas indent2"><span class="nm">1.</span>"Tekulal Chelkasam ba'Aretz" - people will use you to curse ('you should be punished like Dor ha'Mabul').</p>
<p class="bas indent1"><span class="nm">(e)</span>"Lo Yifneh Derech Keramim" - his generation scoffed 'if you are right, why doesn't Hash-m bring the flood right away?'</p>
<p class="bas indent2"><span class="nm">1.</span><span class="cl">Noach:</span> Hash-m wants to take one Tzadik (Mesushelach, in his proper time) first, so he will not be punished with you.</p>
<p class="bas bbbline">108b----------------------------------------108b</p>
<p class="bas indent2"><span class="nm">2.</span><span class="cl">His generation:</span> If so, we need not clear the vineyards (do Teshuvah now)!</p>
<p class="bas indent1"><span class="nm">(f)</span><span class="cl">(Rava):</span> "Lapid Buz l'Ashtus Sha'anan..." - Noach rebuked them with words as hard as Lapidim (flames), and they were Mevazeh (disgracing) him and unafraid. When he told them that the ark is for the Mabul, they said that they can defend themselves:</p>
<p class="bas indent2"><span class="nm">1.</span><span class="cl">His generation:</span> If He will bring a Mabul of fire (your ark will not help you, but) we have Alisah (Rashi - that can withstand fire; Aruch - a creature that can extinguish fire);</p>
<p class="bas indent3"><span class="nm">i.</span>If He will bring a Mabul of water, if it is from the ground, we will cover the ground with iron. If it is from above, we have Akev (or Akush, to absorb or stop it).</p>
<p class="bas indent2"><span class="nm">2.</span><span class="cl">Noach:</span> "Nachon l'Mo'adei Ragel" - He can bring water (alternatively - semen) from between your legs. You cannot stop this!</p>
<p class="bas indent1"><span class="nm">(g)</span><span class="cl">(Beraisa):</span> "Nachon l'Mo'adei Ragel" - the water of the flood was as hot and thick as semen.</p>
<p class="bas indent1"><span class="nm">(h)</span><span class="cl">(Rav Huna):</span> They sinned with hot (semen), therefore they were punished with hot water;</p>
<p class="bas indent2"><span class="nm">1.</span>It says "va'Yashoku ha'Mayim", like "va'Chamas ha'Melech Shochachah" (this implies that before, it was hot).</p>
<p class="bas indent1"><span class="nm">(i)</span><span class="cl">Question:</span> "Va'Yhi l'Shiv'as ha'Yamim" - what happened during these seven days?</p>
<p class="bas indent1"><span class="nm">(j)</span><span class="cl">Answer #1 (Rav):</span> It was the mourning over the death of Mesushelach. This shows that eulogies of a Tzadik hold back punishments.</p>
<p class="bas indent1"><span class="nm">(k)</span><span class="cl">Answer #2:</span> Hash-m changed the nature of the world established in the seven days of creation. The sun rose in the west and set in the east.</p>
<p class="bas indent1"><span class="nm">(l)</span><span class="cl">Answer #3:</span> First Hash-m gave them a long time (120 years) to repent, then He added to this a short time (seven days).</p>
<p class="bas indent1"><span class="nm">(m)</span><span class="cl">Answer #4:</span> During the seven days he gave them a taste of the world to come, so that they would know what they lost.</p>
<p class="bas indent1"><span class="nm">(n)</span><span class="cl">Question:</span> Why does it say "mi'Kol ha'Behemah... Ish v'Ishto"? There is no marriage among animals!</p>
<p class="bas indent1"><span class="nm">(o)</span><span class="cl">Answer (R. Shmuel bar Nachmani):</span> Animals that had not mated with other species were taken.</p>
<p class="bas indent1"><span class="nm">(p)</span><span class="cl">Question:</span> How did Noach know which animals had not sinned?</p>
<p class="bas indent1"><span class="nm">(q)</span><span class="cl">Answer #1 (Rav Chisda):</span> He passed the animals in front of the ark. It would only take those that had not sinned.</p>
<p class="bas indent1"><span class="nm">(r)</span><span class="cl">Answer #2 (R. Avahu):</span> The animals that had not sinned came by themselves.</p>
<p class="bas subject"><span class="nm">4)</span>THE FLOOD (cont.)</p>
<p class="bas indent1"><span class="nm">(a)</span><span class="cl">Question:</span> What is "Tevas Atzei <i>Gofer</i>"?</p>
<p class="bas indent1"><span class="nm">(b)</span><span class="cl">Answer (Rav Ada):</span> It is Mavligah. Some say, it is Gulamish (these are species of cedar).</p>
<p class="bas indent1"><span class="nm">(c)</span><span class="cl">(R. Yochanan):</span> "Tzohar Ta'aseh la'Tevah" - Hash-m told Noach to put gems in the ark that will illuminate like (the sun at) noon.</p>
<p class="bas indent1"><span class="nm">(d)</span>"V'El Amah Techalenah mi'Lma'alah" - in order that it will not topple;</p>
<p class="bas indent1"><span class="nm">(e)</span>"Tachtiyim Shniyim u'Shlishim Ta'aseha" - the bottom floor was for waste, the middle for the animals, the top for the people. (Presumably, at the beginning the food was in the bottom floor, and over the course of the year it was replaced by waste).</p>
<p class="bas indent1"><span class="nm">(f)</span><span class="cl">(Reish Lakish):</span> "Va'Yshalach Es ha'Orev" - the raven gave (what it considered to be) an irrefutable argument:</p>
<p class="bas indent2"><span class="nm">1.</span>Hash-m hates me, and you hate me. Hash-m commanded to take seven (pairs) of each Tahor species, but only one pair of each Tamei species;</p>
<p class="bas indent2"><span class="nm">2.</span>You hate me. You did not take a Tahor species for your mission, rather, me. If the heat or cold will kill me, the world will lack a species (the other raven will die without offspring)!</p>
<p class="bas indent3"><span class="nm">i.</span>Perhaps you desire my mate!</p>
<p class="bas indent2"><span class="nm">3.</span><span class="cl">Noach:</span> Rasha! In the ark, I was forbidden to my wife, who is normally permitted to me. All the more so I am forbidden to your mate, who is always forbidden to me!</p>
<p class="bas indent2"><span class="nm">4.</span><span class="cl">Question:</span> What is the source that Bi'ah was forbidden in the ark?</p>
<p class="bas indent2"><span class="nm">5.</span><span class="cl">Answer:</span> They were commanded to enter "Atah u'Vanecha v'Ishtecha u'Nshei Vanecha" (the men by themselves, and the women by themselves). They were commanded to leave "Atah v'Ishtecha u'Vanecha u'Nshei Vanecha" (as couples).</p>
<p class="bas indent3"><span class="nm">i.</span><span class="cl">(R. Yochanan):</span> This teaches that Bi'ah was forbidden in the ark.</p>
<p class="bas indent1"><span class="nm">(g)</span><span class="cl">(Beraisa):</span> Three had Bi'ah in the ark. The dog, the raven and Cham. All were punished:</p>
<p class="bas indent2"><span class="nm">1.</span>Dogs are normally tied (on a leash; alternatively, they are stuck together after Bi'ah);</p>
<p class="bas indent2"><span class="nm">2.</span>Male ravens spit semen into the females' mouths;</p>
<p class="bas indent2"><span class="nm">3.</span>The skin of (Rashi - Kush, the son of) Cham was stricken (the color changed).</p>
<p class="bas indent1"><span class="nm">(h)</span><span class="cl">(R. Yirmeyah):</span> "Va'Yshalach Es ha'Yonah <i>me</i>'Ito (the dove was near Noach when he sent it)" teaches that it is good for Tahor birds to be near Tzadikim.</p>
<p class="bas indent1"><span class="nm">(i)</span><span class="cl">(R. Elazar):</span> "Alei Zayis Toraf b'Fiha" - the dove told Hash-m that it prefers bitter food (such as olives) directly from Him, to food sweet as honey given by man.</p>
<p class="bas indent2"><span class="nm">1.</span>'Toraf' connotes food - "Hatrifeni Lechem Chuki."</p>
<p class="bas indent1"><span class="nm">(j)</span><span class="cl">(R. Yochanan):</span> "L'Mishpechoseihem Yotz'u Min ha'Tevah" - the animals left as couples (to reproduce), but the people did not (Maharsha).</p>
<p class="bas indent1"><span class="nm">(k)</span><span class="cl">(Rav Chana bar Bizna):</span> Avraham's slave Eliezer asked Shem "l'Mishpechoseihem Yotz'u" (each species by itself). How did you feed each species according to its needs (Rashi; Maharsha - why didn't you also leave as couples?)</p>
<p class="bas indent1"><span class="nm">(l)</span><span class="cl">Shem:</span> We were in great pain (Maharsha - therefore, we simply left like we were in the ark). Some animals must be fed by day, and others by night.</p>
<p class="bas indent2"><span class="nm">1.</span>Noach did not know what to feed the Zikisa (a certain Chayah). One day, Noach was cutting a pomegranate, and a worm fell out, and the Zikisa ate it. From then on, Noach would knead bran (in water). When it became wormy, he would feed it to the Zikisa.</p>
<p class="bas indent2"><span class="nm">2.</span>The lion caught a fever and was nourished by it (it removed its appetite);</p>
<p class="bas indent3"><span class="nm">i.</span><span class="cl">(Rav):</span> A fever nourishes between six and 12 days (some say - months).</p>
<p class="bas indent2"><span class="nm">3.</span>Noach saw the Avarrshinah (Chol, a species of bird that never dies) sleeping in its cell. He asked, don't you need food?</p>
<p class="bas indent2"><span class="nm">4.</span><span class="cl">The Avarrshinah:</span> I saw that you were busy. I did not want to bother you.</p>
<p class="bas indent2"><span class="nm">5.</span><span class="cl">Noach:</span> Hash-m should grant that you never die - "vecha'Chol Arbeh Yamim."</p>
<p class="bas indent1"><span class="nm">(m)</span><span class="cl">(R. Chana bar Livai):</span> Shem asked Eliezer 'How did (Avraham and) you fight the four kings?'</p>
<p class="bas indent2"><span class="nm">1.</span><span class="cl">Eliezer:</span> Hash-m put Avraham on His right. Avraham threw dirt, and it turned into swords. He threw straw, and it turned into arrows - "Ne'um Hash-m l'Adoni Shev li'Mini Ad Shis Oyvecha Hadom l'Raglecha", "...Yiten ke'Afar Charbo k'Kash Nidaf Kashto."</p>
