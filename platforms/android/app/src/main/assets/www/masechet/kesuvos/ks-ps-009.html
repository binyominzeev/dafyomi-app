<p class="bas subject"><span class="nm">1)</span>THE CLAIM OF <i>PESACH</i> <i>PASU'ACH</i></p>
<p class="bas indent1"><span class="nm">(a)</span><span class="cl">(R. Elazar):</span> If a Chasan claims Pesach Pasu'ach (there were no Besulim blocking Bi'ah with the Kalah, i.e. she was not a virgin) he is believed, and she becomes forbidden to him (we suspect that she had Bi'ah with someone after Kidushin).</p>
<p class="bas indent1"><span class="nm">(b)</span><span class="cl">Question:</span> She should be permitted due a Sefek-Sefeka (two doubts)!</p>
<p class="bas indent2"><span class="nm">1.</span>Perhaps the Bi'ah was before Kidushin;</p>
<p class="bas indent2"><span class="nm">2.</span>Even if the Bi'ah was after Kidushin, perhaps she was forced against her will.</p>
<p class="bas indent1"><span class="nm">(c)</span><span class="cl">Answer #1:</span> R. Elazar's law applies to a Kohen's wife, who becomes forbidden to her husband even if she was forced.</p>
<p class="bas indent1"><span class="nm">(d)</span><span class="cl">Answer #2:</span> His law applies to a girl who became Mekudeshes (through her father) before the age of three (Bi'ah was definitely after the Kidushin, for otherwise the Besulim would have grown back).</p>
<p class="bas indent1"><span class="nm">(e)</span><span class="cl">Question:</span> A Mishnah already teaches this (that if one says that something is forbidden to him, he is forbidden, even if he is contradicted)!</p>
<p class="bas indent2"><span class="nm">1.</span><span class="cl">(Mishnah):</span> If one says to a woman 'I was Mekadesh you to me' and she denies it, he may not marry her relatives, but she may marry his relatives.</p>
<p class="bas indent1"><span class="nm">(f)</span><span class="cl">Answer:</span> In that Mishnah he certainly knows the truth. We cannot learn from it R. Elazar's law, for one might have thought that a man cannot tell whether or not the Pesach was Pasu'ach.</p>
<p class="bas indent1"><span class="nm">(g)</span><span class="cl">Question:</span> R. Elazar taught otherwise!</p>
<p class="bas indent2"><span class="nm">1.</span><span class="cl">(R. Elazar):</span> A woman becomes forbidden to her husband only through Kinuy (warning not to be secluded with a particular man) and seclusion, like the episode (of David and Bas Sheva).</p>
<p class="bas indent2"><span class="nm">2.</span><span class="cl">Objection:</span> This cannot be correct. There was no Kinuy and seclusion in that episode! Also, she did not become forbidden!</p>
<p class="bas indent2"><span class="nm">3.</span><span class="cl">Correction:</span> R. Elazar meant, we learn that a woman becomes forbidden only through Kinuy and seclusion <i>from</i> the episode, in which there was not Kinuy and seclusion, and she did not become forbidden.</p>
<p class="bas indent2"><span class="nm">4.</span><span class="cl">Summation of question:</span> How can R. Elazar say that a claim of Pesach Pasu'ach forbids? This is not Kinuy and seclusion!</p>
<p class="bas indent1"><span class="nm">(h)</span><span class="cl">Counter-question:</span> Do you think that R. Elazar says (she can become forbidden) only through Kinuy and seclusion, but not through witnesses (of Bi'ah)?!</p>
<p class="bas indent1"><span class="nm">(i)</span><span class="cl">Retraction:</span> R. Elazar's other teaching says 'a woman becomes forbidden through two witnesses. If there were (two witnesses about) Kinuy and seclusion, even one witness (of Bi'ah forbids her permanently, and she may not drink the Sotah water);</p>
<p class="bas indent2"><span class="nm">1.</span>A claim of Pesach Pasu'ach is like two witnesses.</p>
<p class="bas subject"><span class="nm">2)</span>THE EPISODE</p>
<p class="bas indent1"><span class="nm">(a)</span><span class="cl">Question:</span> Why didn't Bas Sheva become forbidden in the episode?</p>
<p class="bas indent1"><span class="nm">(b)</span><span class="cl">Answer #1:</span> She was forced.</p>
<p class="bas bbbline">9b----------------------------------------9b</p>
<p class="bas indent1"><span class="nm">(c)</span><span class="cl">Answer #2 (Rav Shmuel bar Nachmani):</span> Everyone who went to war in David's army wrote a Get (document of divorce) to his wife.</p>
<p class="bas indent2"><span class="nm">1.</span><span class="cl">(Rav Yosef):</span> "Take Arubasam" - these are things between man and wife (i.e. marriage, which is taken (removed) through a Get).</p>
<p class="bas subject"><span class="nm">3)</span>THE CLAIM OF <i>PESACH</i> <i>PASU'ACH</i></p>
<p class="bas indent1"><span class="nm">(a)</span><span class="cl">Support (for R. Elazar - Abaye - Mishnah):</span> A virgin is married on Wednesday.</p>
<p class="bas indent2"><span class="nm">1.</span><span class="cl">Inference:</span> She is not married on Thursday. We are concerned lest the Chasan calm down (and not come to Beis Din).</p>
<p class="bas indent2"><span class="nm">2.</span><span class="cl">Question:</span> If we are concerned lest he pay a Kesuvah (which she does not deserve), let him pay it! (It is his fault for calming down!)</p>
<p class="bas indent2"><span class="nm">3.</span><span class="cl">Rejection:</span> Rather, the enactment was in order that he come to Beis Din and we will rule that she is forbidden to him.</p>
<p class="bas indent2"><span class="nm">4.</span><span class="cl">Suggestion:</span> The case is, he claims Pesach Pasu'ach!</p>
<p class="bas indent1"><span class="nm">(b)</span><span class="cl">Rejection:</span> No, he claims that there was no blood. (Only this claim forbids, for one does not err about this.)</p>
<p class="bas indent1"><span class="nm">(c)</span><span class="cl">(Rav Yehudah):</span> One who claims Pesach Pasu'ach is believed to deprive her of her Kesuvah.</p>
<p class="bas indent1"><span class="nm">(d)</span><span class="cl">Question (Rav Yosef):</span> We already know this from a Mishnah!</p>
<p class="bas indent2"><span class="nm">1.</span><span class="cl">(Mishnah):</span> One who eats by his father-in-law in Yehudah without witnesses cannot claim later that the Kalah is not a virgin, since he was secluded with her.</p>
<p class="bas indent2"><span class="nm">2.</span><span class="cl">Inference:</span> In Galil (where they are not secluded) he may make such a claim.</p>
<p class="bas indent3"><span class="nm">i.</span>If the claim is to forbid her to him, it should apply also in Yehudah!</p>
<p class="bas indent2"><span class="nm">3.</span>Rather, the claim is to deprive her of her Kesuvah.</p>
<p class="bas indent2"><span class="nm">4.</span><span class="cl">Suggestion:</span> He claims Pesach Pasu'ach.</p>
<p class="bas indent1"><span class="nm">(e)</span><span class="cl">Answer:</span> No, the claim is that there was no blood.</p>
