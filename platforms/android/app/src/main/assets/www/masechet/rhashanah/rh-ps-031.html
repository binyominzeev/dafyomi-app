<p class="bas subject"><span class="nm">1)</span>THE SONGS FOR THE WEEK</p>
<p class="bas indent1"><span class="nm">(a)</span>A Beraisa, citing R. Akiva, lists the songs that the Levi'im would sing for each day of the week:</p>
<p class="bas indent2"><span class="nm">1.</span>On Sunday, they would sing "The world is Hash-m's," as that was the day when He established ownership of the world.</p>
<p class="bas indent2"><span class="nm">2.</span>On Monday, they would sing "Hash-m is great," as He separated His works and reigned over them.</p>
<p class="bas indent2"><span class="nm">3.</span>On Tuesday, they would sing "Hash-m stands in the Divine assembly" as He revealed the land and prepared it for His assembly.</p>
<p class="bas indent2"><span class="nm">4.</span>On Wednesday, they would sing "Hash-m is the G-d of vengeance," as He will exact vengeance from those who worship the sun and moon which were created then.</p>
<p class="bas indent2"><span class="nm">5.</span>On Thursday, they would sing "Rejoice to Hash-m" because He created birds and fish which give cause to praise Him.</p>
<p class="bas indent2"><span class="nm">6.</span>On Friday, they would sing "Hash-m has reigned" because he finished His work and reigned over it.</p>
<p class="bas indent2"><span class="nm">7.</span>On Shabbos they would sing "Mizmor Shir le'Yom ha'Shabbos" - referring to future era which is entirely Shabbos.</p>
<p class="bas indent1"><span class="nm">(b)</span><span class="cl">(R. Nechemiah):</span> The song of Shabbos shouldn't be different in referring to the future; rather, it refers to Hash-m having rested on Shabbos.</p>
<p class="bas indent1"><span class="nm">(c)</span>The dispute between R. Akiva and R. Nechemiah is based on a dispute about whether the future era of Shabbos is equivalent to one day or two:</p>
<p class="bas indent2"><span class="nm">1.</span><span class="cl">(R. Katina):</span> The world will exist for 6000 years and be desolate for 1000.</p>
<p class="bas indent2"><span class="nm">2.</span><span class="cl">(Abaye):</span> It will be desolate for 2000 years.</p>
<p class="bas indent1"><span class="nm">(d)</span>On Musaf of Shabbos, they would sing Ha'azinu, referred to by the acronym of the sections HaZiYV LaCh.</p>
<p class="bas indent2"><span class="nm">1.</span>The Parashah is broken up this way for leyning also.</p>
<p class="bas indent1"><span class="nm">(e)</span>On Minchah of Shabbos, they would sing Shiras ha'Yam, Mi Kamocha, and Alei Be'er.</p>
<p class="bas indent1"><span class="nm">(f)</span><span class="cl">Question:</span> Were all the parts of Ha'azinu read each Shabbos, or was it split up?</p>
<p class="bas indent1"><span class="nm">(g)</span><span class="cl">Answer:</span> A Beraisa states that in the time that the Shirah of Musaf was completed, the Shirah of the Minchah Tamid was repeated twice (i.e. six weeks), so we see that it was split up.</p>
<p class="bas subject"><span class="nm">2)</span>THE JOURNEYS OF THE <i>SHECHINAH</i></p>
<p class="bas indent1"><span class="nm">(a)</span>The Shechinah journeyed ten tourneys during the Destruction of the First Beis ha'Mikdash, as derived from Pesukim:</p>
<p class="bas indent2"><span class="nm">1.</span>From the Aron-cover, to a Keruv, to the other Keruv, to the threshold, to the courtyard, to the altar, to the roof, to the wall, to the city, to Har Zeisim, to the wilderness, to its place in Heaven.</p>
<p class="bas indent3"><span class="nm">i.</span><span class="cl">(R. Yochanan):</span> The Shechinah lingered for six months in the wilderness, hoping that the Jews would repent; it cursed them when they didn't.</p>
<p class="bas indent1"><span class="nm">(b)</span>Correspondingly, the Sanhedrin suffered ten exiles after the Destruction of the Second Beis ha'Mikdash, as we know from Oral Tradition:</p>
<p class="bas indent2"><span class="nm">1.</span>From the Lishkas ha'Gazis, to Chanus, to Yerushalayim, to Yavneh, to Usha, back to Yavneh, back to Usha, to Shefar'am, to Beis She'arim, to Tzipori, to Tiveria, which was the deepest exile of all.</p>
<p class="bas bbbline">31b----------------------------------------31b</p>
<p class="bas indent2"><span class="nm">2.</span><span class="cl">(R. Eliezer):</span> There were only six exiles, as derived from a Pasuk.</p>
<p class="bas indent1"><span class="nm">(c)</span><span class="cl">(R. Yochanan):</span> They are destined to be redeemed, as we see from a Pasuk.</p>
<p class="bas subject"><span class="nm">3)</span><i>MISHNAH:</i> R. YOCHANAN'S DECREE ABOUT WITNESSES</p>
<p class="bas indent1"><span class="nm">(a)</span>Another decree of R. Yochanan ben Zakai was that even if the Rosh Beis Din was elsewhere, the witnesses need only go to the Beis Din.</p>
<p class="bas subject"><span class="nm">4)</span>WHETHER WITNESSES NEED TO TRAVEL</p>
<p class="bas indent1"><span class="nm">(a)</span>Ameimar excommunicated a woman summoned for litigation who failed to follow him when he left his Beis Din to Mechuza.</p>
<p class="bas indent1"><span class="nm">(b)</span>R. Ashi challenged him from our Mishnah which states that the witnesses do not need to go to the Rosh Beis Din.</p>
<p class="bas indent1"><span class="nm">(c)</span>He replied that that only applies to witnesses for the moon, who we don't want to discourage, but not to this litigation, where the debtor is subject to the wishes of the creditor.</p>
<p class="bas subject"><span class="nm">5)</span>THE DECREES OF R. YOCHANAN BEN ZAKAI</p>
<p class="bas indent1"><span class="nm">(a)</span><span class="cl">(Beraisa):</span> Kohanim may not Duchen while wearing shoes.</p>
<p class="bas indent1"><span class="nm">(b)</span>This is one of the nine decrees of R. Yochanan ben Zakai.</p>
<p class="bas indent1"><span class="nm">(c)</span>This is the sixth one mentioned in this Perek (following Shofar on Shabbos in all towns with Beis Din, Lulav all seven days, Chadash forbidden on the 16th, all-day acceptance of testimony, and witnesses only going to the Va'ad).</p>
<p class="bas indent1"><span class="nm">(d)</span>Another was in the first Perek (of witnesses only transgressing Shabbos for Nisan and Tishrei.</p>
<p class="bas indent1"><span class="nm">(e)</span>The eighth is that a convert must separate a quarter-shekel for his bird-offering (to be brought when the Beis ha'Mikdash is rebuilt).</p>
<p class="bas indent2"><span class="nm">1.</span><span class="cl">(R. Shimon ben Elazar):</span> This has been annulled, because of the risk of his taking benefit from it.</p>
<p class="bas indent1"><span class="nm">(f)</span>The ninth is subject to a dispute between R. Papa and R. Nachman bar Yitzchak:</p>
<p class="bas indent2"><span class="nm">1.</span><span class="cl">(R. Papa):</span> It concerns Kerem Revai (fourth year fruit):</p>
<p class="bas indent3"><span class="nm">i.</span><span class="cl">(Mishnah):</span> Kerem Revai was brought to Yerushalayim (instead of redeemed) from everywhere within a day's walk, encompassing Eilas, Akrabas, Lod, and the Yarden.</p>
<p class="bas indent3"><span class="nm">ii.</span>This was done in order to decorate Yerushalayim with fruit.</p>
<p class="bas indent3"><span class="nm">iii.</span>R. Eliezer had Kerem Revai that he wanted to give to the poor instead, and his students told him that his colleagues had already decreed that it was permitted to do so.</p>
<p class="bas indent3"><span class="nm">iv.</span>These "colleagues" refer to R. Yochanan ben Zakai.</p>
<p class="bas indent2"><span class="nm">2.</span><span class="cl">(R. Nachman bar Yitzchak):</span> It concerns the strip of red wool:</p>
<p class="bas indent3"><span class="nm">i.</span><span class="cl">(Beraisa):</span> Originally, they would hang a strip of red wool up on Yom Kipur; if it turned white, the people would rejoice, but otherwise, they would despair.</p>
<p class="bas indent3"><span class="nm">ii.</span>It was decreed that it should be hung inside the Ulam of the Beis ha'Mikdash, but people would still peek in.</p>
<p class="bas indent3"><span class="nm">iii.</span>R. Yochanan ben Zakai therefore decreed that half of it should be tied to a rock and the other half tied to the goat thrown to Azazel.</p>
<p class="bas indent2"><span class="nm">3.</span>R. Nachman bar Yitzchak disagreed with R. Papa's explanation as R. Yochanan ben Zakai was not a colleague of R. Eliezer but a teacher.</p>
<p class="bas indent3"><span class="nm">i.</span>R. Papa would respond that it would be disrespectful for R. Eliezer's students to refer to him that way.</p>
<p class="bas indent2"><span class="nm">4.</span>R. Papa disagreed with R. Nachman bar Yitzchak's explanation as R. Yochanan ben Zakai ruled only for his last forty years, some of which was after the Destruction, and we know that the wool never turned white within the last forty years of the Beis ha'Mikdash.</p>
<p class="bas indent3"><span class="nm">i.</span>R. Nachman bar Yitzchak would respond that even before he ruled, he might have said it to his teacher, who would have enacted it in his name.</p>
