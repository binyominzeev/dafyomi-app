<p class="bas subject"><span class="nm">1)</span>USING <i>KELIM</i> FOR UNUSUAL PURPOSES ON SHABBOS</p>
<p class="bas indent1"><span class="nm">(a)</span><span class="cl">Question (Abaye - Beraisa):</span> If there is garlic in a Meduchah (a bowl in which things are pounded), it may be moved; if not, not.</p>
<p class="bas indent1"><span class="nm">(b)</span><span class="cl">Answer (Rabah):</span> That is like R. Nechemyah, who permits moving a Kli only for its intended purpose.</p>
<p class="bas indent1"><span class="nm">(c)</span><span class="cl">Question (Abaye - Mishnah - Beis Shamai):</span> One may not take an Eli (a thick board used to crush wheat) to cut meat on it [on Yom Tov];</p>
<p class="bas indent2"><span class="nm">1.</span>Beis Hillel permit.</p>
<p class="bas indent2"><span class="nm">2.</span>Both agree that if one cut meat on it, it may not be moved [afterwards - even Beis Hillel permit only for the sake of Simchas Yom Tov].</p>
<p class="bas indent1"><span class="nm">(d)</span><span class="cl">Intended Answer:</span> Rabah was going to answer that also this is like R. Nechemyah;</p>
<p class="bas indent1"><span class="nm">(e)</span><span class="cl">Answer:</span> Rabah heard Rav Chinena say that all agree about dying (alternatively - weaving) tools (they may not be used for other purposes) - since people care about them, they fix a place for them - we can say the same about an Eli.</p>
<p class="bas indent1"><span class="nm">(f)</span><span class="cl">(R. Chiya bar Aba):</span> The Mishnah permits a hammer used to beat gold (people are not so concerned for it, for banging it on the anvil fixes it).</p>
<p class="bas indent1"><span class="nm">(g)</span><span class="cl">(R. Shemen bar Aba):</span> It permits a hammer used to grind spices.</p>
<p class="bas indent1"><span class="nm">(h)</span>All the more so, R. Shemen permits a hammer for gold - but R. Chiya forbids a hammer for spices, people are insistent that it not get repulsive.</p>
<p class="bas subject"><span class="nm">2)</span>TILTUL MIN HA'TZAD</p>
<p class="bas indent1"><span class="nm">(a)</span><span class="cl">(Mishnah):</span> A spindle or Karkar...</p>
<p class="bas indent1"><span class="nm">(b)</span><span class="cl">(Beraisa):</span> If an unripe fig was wrapped in straw, or if a cake was wrapped in coals:</p>
<p class="bas indent2"><span class="nm">1.</span>If it is partially exposed, one may move it; if not, not;</p>
<p class="bas indent2"><span class="nm">2.</span>R. Eliezer ben Tadai says, one may insert a spindle or Karkar into it [and take it], the wrapping falls off by itself.</p>
<p class="bas indent1"><span class="nm">(c)</span><span class="cl">(Rav Nachman):</span> The Halachah follows R. Eliezer ben Tadai.</p>
<p class="bas indent1"><span class="nm">(d)</span><span class="cl">Question:</span> This implies that Rav Nachman holds that Tiltul Min ha'Tzad Lo Shmei Tiltul (indirect movement [of Muktzeh] is not considered movement, it is permitted);</p>
<p class="bas indent2"><span class="nm">1.</span>However, he permits to remove a radish that is partially in the ground only if it is right side up (for the top is wider, so he does not move dirt when taking it), not if it is upside down!</p>
<p class="bas indent1"><span class="nm">(e)</span><span class="cl">Answer:</span> Rav Nachman retracted from that teaching [about the radish].</p>
<p class="bas subject"><span class="nm">3)</span>ARE THE LAWS OF <i>TUM'AH</i> AND SHABBOS INDEPENDENT?</p>
<p class="bas indent1"><span class="nm">(a)</span><span class="cl">(Mishnah):</span> A hand needle [to remove a thorn].</p>
<p class="bas indent1"><span class="nm">(b)</span><span class="cl">Question (Rava brei d'Rabah):</span> May one move a needle if its hole or point was removed?</p>
<p class="bas indent1"><span class="nm">(c)</span><span class="cl">Answer (Rav Yosef - Mishnah):</span> A hand needle, to remove a thorn.</p>
<p class="bas indent2"><span class="nm">1.</span>The hole is not needed to remove a thorn!</p>
<p class="bas indent1"><span class="nm">(d)</span><span class="cl">Question (Mishnah):</span> If the hole or point of a needle is missing, it is Tahor.</p>
<p class="bas indent1"><span class="nm">(e)</span><span class="cl">Answer (Abaye):</span> You cannot ask from Tum'ah to Shabbos!</p>
<p class="bas indent2"><span class="nm">1.</span>Tum'ah depends on 'Kli Ma'aseh' (it still serves the use it was made for), Shabbos depends on being useful - it can remove a thorn!</p>
<p class="bas indent1"><span class="nm">(f)</span><span class="cl">Objection (Rava):</span> He can ask - since it is not a Kli regarding Tum'ah [even if it will be designated for use], it is not a Kli regarding Shabbos!</p>
<p class="bas indent1"><span class="nm">(g)</span><span class="cl">Question (Beraisa):</span> A needle may be moved on Shabbos whether or not it has a hole - only Tum'ah depends on having a hole.</p>
<p class="bas indent1"><span class="nm">(h)</span><span class="cl">Answer (Abaye, for Rava):</span> The Beraisa discusses unfinished needles - sometimes one decides to use them as is [without a hole, therefore they may be moved];</p>
<p class="bas indent2"><span class="nm">1.</span>However, if the hole or point of a finished needle was removed, one throws it amidst scrap metal (it is no longer a Kli).</p>
<p class="bas indent1"><span class="nm">(i)</span><span class="cl">(Rav Nachman):</span> Asuvi Yenuka (to straighten limbs of a baby [that were disturbed through birth; R. Chananel - removing Orlah [excess flesh] of the throat from a baby using the fingers, this often indices vomiting] is forbidden;</p>
<p class="bas indent1"><span class="nm">(j)</span><span class="cl">(Rav Sheshes):</span> It is permitted.</p>
<p class="bas indent1"><span class="nm">(k)</span><span class="cl">Support (Rav Nachman, for himself - Mishnah):</span> One may not drink Afiktizin [to make himself vomit, to make room to eat more];</p>
<p class="bas bbbline">123b----------------------------------------123b</p>
<p class="bas indent1"><span class="nm">(l)</span><span class="cl">Rejection (Rav Sheshes):</span> That is abnormal, but Asuvi Yenuka is normal (Rashi - like eating and drinking).</p>
<p class="bas indent1"><span class="nm">(m)</span><span class="cl">Support (Rav Sheshes, for himself - Mishnah):</span> [One may take] a hand needle to remove a thorn.</p>
<p class="bas indent1"><span class="nm">(n)</span><span class="cl">Rejection (Rav Nachman):</span> The thorn is merely deposited in the skin (it is not embedded), removing it is not Tikun (fixing something) - you cannot say this about the limbs (R. Chananel - Orlah), Asuvi Yenuka is Tikun!</p>
<p class="bas indent1"><span class="nm">(o)</span><span class="cl">(Mishnah):</span> An olive stick (used to flip and check olives waiting to be pressed) is Mekabel Tum'ah only if it has a cap at the end;</p>
<p class="bas indent1"><span class="nm">(p)</span>In either case it may be moved on Shabbos.</p>
<p class="bas indent1"><span class="nm">(q)</span><span class="cl">(Gemara) Question:</span> [Even if it has a cap,] it is a Pashut Kli Etz (wooden Kli that does not hold anything), it is not Mekabel Tum'ah!</p>
<p class="bas indent2"><span class="nm">1.</span><span class="cl">Question:</span> Why are Peshutei Klei Etz Tehorim?</p>
<p class="bas indent2"><span class="nm">2.</span><span class="cl">Answer:</span> Klei Etz that Mekabel Tum'ah are equated to Sak, i.e. they must hold something.</p>
<p class="bas indent1"><span class="nm">(r)</span><span class="cl">Answer (Beraisa):</span> When one flips the olives, one turns it over to see if there is oil in the cap (it is like a receptacle).</p>
<p class="bas subject"><span class="nm">4)</span>WHICH <i>KELIM</i> MAY BE MOVED ON SHABBOS?</p>
<p class="bas indent1"><span class="nm">(a)</span><span class="cl">(Mishnah - R. Yosi):</span> Any Kli may be moved, except for a big saw or the blade of a plow (people do not use them for anything else).</p>
<p class="bas indent1"><span class="nm">(b)</span><span class="cl">(Gemara - Rav Nachman):</span> A launderer's sieve (used to sprinkle water on clothes or to enable clothes to absorb scent of incense) is like a plow blade.</p>
<p class="bas indent1"><span class="nm">(c)</span><span class="cl">(Abaye):</span> A knife of shoemakers (for cutting or scraping leather) or of butchers (for chopping meat or slaughtering) and a carpenter's axe are like a plow blade.</p>
<p class="bas indent1"><span class="nm">(d)</span><span class="cl">(Beraisa):</span> At first, they said that only three Kelim may be moved (Tosfos - except for Kelim that hold things - surely, cups, bowls and plates were permitted) - a knife to cut a ring of figs, a big spoon to remove froth from pots and a small table knife;</p>
<p class="bas indent2"><span class="nm">1.</span>They permitted more, and permitted more, until they permitted all Kelim except for a big saw or a plow blade.</p>
<p class="bas indent1"><span class="nm">(e)</span><span class="cl">Question:</span> What does it mean 'They permitted more, and permitted more'?</p>
<p class="bas indent1"><span class="nm">(f)</span><span class="cl">Answer #1 (Abaye):</span> They permitted to use Kli she'Melachto l'Heter (it is used for something permitted on Shabbos), then permitted to move it when its place is needed, then permitted to use Kli she'Melachto l'Isur (for permitted uses) but not for the sake of its place;</p>
<p class="bas indent2"><span class="nm">1.</span>Still, only Kelim that can be moved with one hand were permitted, not those that require two, until they permitted all Kelim (with exceptions), even those that require two hands.</p>
<p class="bas indent1"><span class="nm">(g)</span><span class="cl">Objection (Rava):</span> It says that they permitted - this applies to its use and for its place!</p>
<p class="bas indent1"><span class="nm">(h)</span><span class="cl">Answer #2 (Rava):</span> They permitted Kli she'Melachto l'Heter both for its use and place, then permitted to move it out of the sun to the shade [so it will not get ruined]; later, they permitted Kli she'Melachto l'Isur for its use or place, but not from the sun to the shade;</p>
<p class="bas indent2"><span class="nm">1.</span>Still, only Kelim that can be moved by one person were permitted, not those that require two, until they permitted all Kelim, even those that require two people.</p>
<p class="bas indent1"><span class="nm">(i)</span><span class="cl">Question (Abaye - Beraisa):</span> If there is garlic in a Meduchah, it may be moved; if not, not.</p>
<p class="bas indent1"><span class="nm">(j)</span><span class="cl">Answer (Rava):</span> That refers to moving it from the sun to the shade.</p>
<p class="bas indent1"><span class="nm">(k)</span><span class="cl">Question (Beraisa):</span> Both [Beis Shamai and Beis Hillel] agree that if one cut meat on it (an Eli) it may not be moved.</p>
<p class="bas indent1"><span class="nm">(l)</span><span class="cl">Answer (Rava):</span> Also that refers to moving it from the sun to the shade.</p>
<p class="bas indent1"><span class="nm">(m)</span><span class="cl">(R. Chanina):</span> This Beraisa (that only three Kelim were permitted at first) was taught in the days of the Navi Nechemyah - "Ba'Yamim ha'Hemah Ra'isi bi'Yhudah Dorchim Gitos ba'Shabbos u'Mevi'im ha'Arimos" (people were Mechalel Shabbos, it was necessary to be extra stringent).</p>
