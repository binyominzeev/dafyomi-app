<p class="bas indent1"><span class="nm">(a)</span><span class="cl">Question (Rav Hamnuna):</span> To where did the Kedushah go?</p>
<p class="bas indent2"><span class="nm">1.</span>If a man told a woman 'today you are my wife, tomorrow you are not', does she cease to be his wife without a Get?!</p>
<p class="bas indent1"><span class="nm">(b)</span><span class="cl">Answer (Rava):</span> You cannot equate monetary Kedushah to intrinsic Kedushah!</p>
<p class="bas indent2"><span class="nm">1.</span>Monetary Kedushah can vanish; intrinsic Kedushah cannot.</p>
<p class="bas indent1"><span class="nm">(c)</span><span class="cl">Objection (Abaye):</span> Also intrinsic Kedushah can vanish!</p>
<p class="bas indent2"><span class="nm">1.</span><span class="cl">(Beraisa):</span> If one said 'this ox is an Olah for 30 days. After 30 days, it is a Shelamim', for 30 days it is an Olah; after that, a Shelamim.</p>
<p class="bas indent2"><span class="nm">2.</span>This shows that intrinsic Kedushah can vanish!</p>
<p class="bas indent1"><span class="nm">(d)</span><span class="cl">Answer (Rava):</span> The case is he said that the value of the ox should be for an Olah .</p>
<p class="bas indent1"><span class="nm">(e)</span><span class="cl">Question:</span> If so, why does the Seifa say 'after 30 days, this ox is an Olah . From now, it is a Shelamim' (his words are fulfilled)?</p>
<p class="bas indent2"><span class="nm">1.</span>Granted, if one discusses intrinsic Kedushah and the other discusses monetary Kedushah, the Tana needed to teach both cases.</p>
<p class="bas bbbline">29b----------------------------------------29b</p>
<p class="bas indent3"><span class="nm">i.</span>One might have thought that intrinsic Kedushah cannot vanish, but monetary Kedushah can!</p>
<p class="bas indent2"><span class="nm">2.</span>But if both discuss monetary Kedushah, why must two cases be taught?</p>
<p class="bas indent3"><span class="nm">i.</span>If a severe Kedushah (an Olah) can vanish, to be replaced by a light Kedushah (a Shelamim), all the more so, a light Kedushah can vanish, to be replaced regarding a severe Kedushah!</p>
<p class="bas indent1"><span class="nm">(f)</span><span class="cl">Suggestion:</span> This refutes bar Pada, who says that even monetary Kedushah cannot vanish.</p>
<p class="bas indent1"><span class="nm">(g)</span><span class="cl">Rejection (Rav Papa):</span> No. He can explain the Beraisa to say that had he not said 'It is a Shelamim from now', it would be an Olah after 30 days.</p>
<p class="bas indent2"><span class="nm">1.</span>This is like a man who tells a woman 'You will be Mekudeshes to me after 30 days.' The Kidushin takes effect, even if the money is consumed in the meantime.</p>
<p class="bas indent2"><span class="nm">2.</span><span class="cl">Objection:</span> This is obvious!</p>
<p class="bas indent2"><span class="nm">3.</span><span class="cl">Answer #1:</span> The Chidush is, it takes effect even if in the meantime he wants to retract the Kidushin.</p>
<p class="bas indent2"><span class="nm">4.</span><span class="cl">Question:</span> This is like the opinion that she may not retract during the 30 days. According to the opinion that she may retract during the 30 days, how can we answer?</p>
<p class="bas indent1"><span class="nm">(h)</span><span class="cl">Answer:</span> Even that opinion admits that here he cannot retract, for saying that one will give something to Hekdesh is like handing over to a person (an acquisition).</p>
