<p class="bas indent1"><span class="nm">(a)</span><span class="cl">(Mishnah):</span> If they reclined, one blesses for everyone.</p>
<p class="bas indent1"><span class="nm">(b)</span><span class="cl">Version #1 (Rav):</span> Only bread requires reclining (for one to bless for everyone), wine does not require reclining.</p>
<p class="bas indent1"><span class="nm">(c)</span><span class="cl">(R. Yochanan):</span> Even wine requires reclining.</p>
<p class="bas indent1"><span class="nm">(d)</span><span class="cl">Version #2 (Rav):</span> Reclining helps only for bread (for one to bless for everyone), it does not help for wine;</p>
<p class="bas indent1"><span class="nm">(e)</span><span class="cl">(R. Yochanan):</span> It helps even for wine. (End of Version #2)</p>
<p class="bas indent1"><span class="nm">(f)</span><span class="cl">Question (Beraisa):</span> The order of reclining is: guests enter and sit on benches and soft chairs, until everyone enters; they bring water, everyone washes one hand (with which he will hold a cup);</p>
<p class="bas indent2"><span class="nm">1.</span>Wine is brought -- everyone blesses for himself;</p>
<p class="bas indent2"><span class="nm">2.</span>They recline on beds; they bring water -- even though everyone already washed one hand, they wash both hands.</p>
<p class="bas indent2"><span class="nm">3.</span>Wine is brought -- even though everyone already blessed for himself, one blesses again for everyone.</p>
<p class="bas indent2"><span class="nm">4.</span>According to Version #1, the Reisha (first serving of wine) refutes Rav (who always allows one to bless for everyone on wine);</p>
<p class="bas indent1"><span class="nm">(g)</span><span class="cl">Answer:</span> Guests are different -- because they will later go to recline on beds, they are not Kevu'im (fixed together) until they recline.</p>
<p class="bas indent1"><span class="nm">(h)</span><span class="cl">Question:</span> According to Version #2, the Seifa (second wine) refutes Rav (who says that reclining does not help for wine)!</p>
<p class="bas indent1"><span class="nm">(i)</span><span class="cl">Answer:</span> Since reclining helps for bread (which they will eat), it also helps for wine.</p>
<p class="bas indent1"><span class="nm">(j)</span><span class="cl">(Mishnah):</span> If wine was brought during the meal (everyone blesses for himself).</p>
<p class="bas indent1"><span class="nm">(k)</span><span class="cl">(Beraisa) Question:</span> Why must everyone bless for himself on wine during the meal, but one blesses for everyone on wine after the meal?</p>
<p class="bas indent1"><span class="nm">(l)</span><span class="cl">Answer (Ben Zoma):</span> During the meal, people have food in their mouths when the leader blesses (Rashi - and they will not listen to the blessing; R. Yonah - they might choke if they answer Amen to the blessing).</p>
<p class="bas indent1"><span class="nm">(m)</span><span class="cl">(Mishnah):</span> He (the one who blessed on the wine after the meal) blesses on the incense.</p>
<p class="bas indent1"><span class="nm">(n)</span><span class="cl">Question:</span> This implies, even if there is someone [more important than he and hence] more fitting to bless, he blesses (because he blessed on the wine)!</p>
<p class="bas indent1"><span class="nm">(o)</span>(We follow Gra and Bach, who delete several words from the text.)</p>
<p class="bas indent1"><span class="nm">(p)</span><span class="cl">Answer:</span> This supports Rav.</p>
<p class="bas indent2"><span class="nm">1.</span><span class="cl">(Rav):</span> The one who washes his hands first after the meal should say Birkas ha'Mazon for everyone. (Likewise, the one who began to make blessings after the meal continues to do so.)</p>
<p class="bas indent1"><span class="nm">(q)</span>Rav and R. Chiya were eating with Rebbi. Rebbi told Rav to wash his hands; Rav was nervous (he thought that he had eaten with soiled hands, or that he was taken too long to eat).</p>
<p class="bas indent2"><span class="nm">1.</span><span class="cl">R. Chiya (to Rav):</span> Rebbi is just telling you to prepare to say Birkas ha'Mazon for everyone.</p>
<p class="bas subject"><span class="nm">2)</span>BLESSINGS FOR SMELLS</p>
<p class="bas indent1"><span class="nm">(a)</span><span class="cl">(R. Zeira citing Rava bar Yirmeyah):</span> We may bless on incense from when the cloud of smoke arises.</p>
<p class="bas indent1"><span class="nm">(b)</span><span class="cl">Question (R. Zeira):</span> He does not smell it yet!</p>
<p class="bas indent2"><span class="nm">1.</span><span class="cl">Counter-question (Rava bar Yirmeyah):</span> One blesses ha'Motzi before eating the bread!</p>
<p class="bas indent2"><span class="nm">2.</span><span class="cl">Answer (Rava):</span> You must say, he may bless because he intends [and is about] to eat;</p>
<p class="bas indent1"><span class="nm">(c)</span><span class="cl">Answer (Rava):</span> Here also, he may bless because he intends [and is about] to smell!</p>
<p class="bas indent1"><span class="nm">(d)</span><span class="cl">(Rav Chisda):</span> We bless Borei Atzei Besamim on every kind of incense, except for musk, for it is from an animal, its blessing is Borei Minei Besamim;</p>
<p class="bas indent1"><span class="nm">(e)</span><span class="cl">Question (Beraisa):</span> We bless Borei Atzei Besamim only on balsam of Beis Rebbi and Beis Kaiser, and any myrtle.</p>
<p class="bas indent1"><span class="nm">(f)</span>Rav Chisda is refuted.</p>
<p class="bas indent1"><span class="nm">(g)</span><span class="cl">Question (Rav Chisda):</span> What do we bless on balsam oil?</p>
<p class="bas indent1"><span class="nm">(h)</span><span class="cl">Answer #1 (R. Yitzchak citing Rav Yehudah):</span> We bless Borei Shemen Artzeinu (Who creates oil of our land).</p>
<p class="bas indent1"><span class="nm">(i)</span><span class="cl">Question (Rav Chisda):</span> That is Rav Yehudah's opinion, for he cherishes Eretz Yisrael exceedingly -- what does everyone else bless?</p>
<p class="bas indent1"><span class="nm">(j)</span><span class="cl">Answer #2 (R. Yitzchak citing R. Yochanan):</span> We bless Borei Shemen Arev (Who creates pleasant oil).</p>
<p class="bas indent1"><span class="nm">(k)</span><span class="cl">(Rav Ada bar Ahavah):</span> We bless Borei Atzei Besamim on costus (Kasharta; one of the spices in the Ketores), but not on oil which absorbed the aroma of costus inside it</p>
<p class="bas indent1"><span class="nm">(l)</span><span class="cl">(Rav Kahana):</span> We bless Borei Atzei Besamim even on oil which absorbed the aroma of costus inside it, but not on oil into which costus was ground.</p>
<p class="bas indent1"><span class="nm">(m)</span><span class="cl">(Chachamim of Neharde'a):</span> We bless Borei Atzei Besamim even on oil into which costus was ground.</p>
<p class="bas bbbline">43b----------------------------------------43b</p>
<p class="bas indent1"><span class="nm">(n)</span><span class="cl">(Rav Gidal):</span> We bless Borei Atzei Besamim on jasmine.</p>
<p class="bas indent1"><span class="nm">(o)</span><span class="cl">(Rav Chananel):</span> We bless Borei Atzei Besamim on Shiboles Nerd (spinekard, one of the ingredients in the Ketores; it grows in capsules, like flax).</p>
<p class="bas indent2"><span class="nm">1.</span><span class="cl">(Mar Zutra):</span> He learns from "va'Titmenem b'Fishtei ha'Etz" (flax is called a tree).</p>
<p class="bas indent1"><span class="nm">(p)</span><span class="cl">(Rav Mesharshiya):</span> We bless Borei Atzei Besamim on garden roses, and Borei Isvei Besamim on wild roses.</p>
<p class="bas indent1"><span class="nm">(q)</span><span class="cl">(Rav Sheshes):</span> We bless Borei Isvei Besamim on violets.</p>
<p class="bas indent1"><span class="nm">(r)</span><span class="cl">(Mar Zutra):</span> One who smells an Esrog or quince blesses, "she'Nasan Re'ach Tov ba'Peros."</p>
<p class="bas indent1"><span class="nm">(s)</span><span class="cl">(Rav Yehudah):</span> One who sees trees budding in the month of Nisan says, "Blessed is He Who did not omit anything from His world, and created nice creations and trees for people to enjoy."</p>
<p class="bas subject"><span class="nm">3)</span>TEACHINGS OF MAR ZUTRA BAR TUVYA</p>
<p class="bas indent1"><span class="nm">(a)</span><span class="cl">Question (Mar Zutra bar Tuvya):</span> What is the source that we bless for fragrances?</p>
<p class="bas indent1"><span class="nm">(b)</span><span class="cl">Answer:</span> "Kol ha'Neshamah Tehalel Kah" -- scents benefit the Neshamah, not the body.</p>
<p class="bas indent1"><span class="nm">(c)</span><span class="cl">(Mar Zutra bar Tuvya):</span> In the future, young men (some texts - who never sinned) will give off an arome as nice as [the leaves and flowers of] Lebanon -- "v'Re'ach Lo ka'Levanon."</p>
<p class="bas indent1"><span class="nm">(d)</span><span class="cl">Question (Mar Zutra bar Tuvya):</span> What do we learn from "Es ha'Kol Asah Yafeh v'Ito"?</p>
<p class="bas indent1"><span class="nm">(e)</span><span class="cl">Answer:</span> This teaches that Hash-m made everyone happy with his profession (Maharsha - at the time when He decreed what profession the person will have).</p>
<p class="bas indent1"><span class="nm">(f)</span><span class="cl">(Rav Papa):</span> This is like people say -- hang moss for a pig [for him to eat it], and it will do its thing (roll it in the mud).</p>
<p class="bas indent1"><span class="nm">(g)</span><span class="cl">(Mar Zutra bar Tuvya):</span> A torch is like [a company of] two people (which protects from Mazikim at night), moonlight is like three.</p>
<p class="bas indent1"><span class="nm">(h)</span><span class="cl">Question:</span> Are these like two and three including the person, or excluding him?</p>
<p class="bas indent1"><span class="nm">(i)</span><span class="cl">Answer:</span> He said that moonlight is like three -- we understand this if it means three including him;</p>
<p class="bas indent2"><span class="nm">1.</span><span class="cl">Question:</span> But if it means three excluding him, what advantage is there to three over two?</p>
<p class="bas indent2"><span class="nm">2.</span><span class="cl">(It was taught):</span> A Mazik can appear to a lone person and damage him, it can appear to two people but will not damage him, it does not appear to three people.</p>
<p class="bas indent1"><span class="nm">(j)</span><span class="cl">Conclusion:</span> A torch and moonlight are like two and three including the person.</p>
<p class="bas indent1"><span class="nm">(k)</span><span class="cl">(Mar Zutra bar Tuvya):</span> It is better to throw oneself into a lit furnace than to make someone blush by embarrassing him;</p>
<p class="bas indent2"><span class="nm">1.</span>We learn from Tamar -- "Hi Mutzeis v'Hi Shalchah" (she would not embarrass Yehudah by saying that she was pregnant from him, in order to save herself from being burned).</p>
<p class="bas subject"><span class="nm">4)</span>THE ORDER OF BLESSINGS</p>
<p class="bas indent1"><span class="nm">(a)</span><span class="cl">(Beraisa - Beis Shamai):</span> If one wants to bless on [scented] oil and myrtle, he blesses first on the oil, then on the myrtle;</p>
<p class="bas indent1"><span class="nm">(b)</span>Beis Hillel says, he blesses first on the myrtle, then on the oil.</p>
<p class="bas indent1"><span class="nm">(c)</span><span class="cl">R. Gamliel:</span> I will arbitrate:</p>
<p class="bas indent2"><span class="nm">1.</span>We should bless first on oil, for we get two benefits from it -- anointing and fragrance, but our only benefit from myrtle is its fragrance.</p>
<p class="bas indent1"><span class="nm">(d)</span><span class="cl">(R. Yochanan):</span> The Halachah follows the arbiter. (Normally, this refers to a third, mediating opinion that is like the first opinion in some cases and like the second opinion in others; the Halachah normally follows such an opinion. Here, R. Gamliel merely decided like Beis Shamai, and R. Yochanan rules like him.)</p>
<p class="bas indent1"><span class="nm">(e)</span>Oil and myrtle were brought in front of Rav Papa; he blessed first on the myrtle, then on the oil.</p>
<p class="bas indent1"><span class="nm">(f)</span><span class="cl">Rav Huna brei d'Rav Ika:</span> Don't you hold that the Halachah follows the arbiter?!</p>
<p class="bas indent1"><span class="nm">(g)</span><span class="cl">Rav Papa:</span> Rava said that the Halachah follows Beis Hillel.</p>
<p class="bas indent1"><span class="nm">(h)</span><span class="cl">Version #1 (Rashi):</span> This is wrong (Rava did not say this, Rav Papa merely wanted to spare himself from shame. Sheyarei Korban - the Halachah is, one may say things in the name of his Rebbi which his Rebbi did not say (unlike the Beraisa (27b)). Maharlbach - a Chacham must be "Modeh Al ha'Emes" (admit that his teaching is wrong), but not when he acted according to it, for that is a great embarrassment.)</p>
<p class="bas indent1"><span class="nm">(i)</span>(Tosfos and Gra say that the above is not in the Rif's text, for he rules like Rava. Alternatively, Rif could explain like Version #2.)</p>
<p class="bas indent1"><span class="nm">(j)</span><span class="cl">Version #2 (Rama mi'Pano):</span> This is imprecise. (Rava did not say this; Rav Papa knew that the Halachah follows Beis Hillel, he preferred to attribute the ruling to his Rebbi.) (End of Version #2)</p>
<p class="bas indent1"><span class="nm">(k)</span><span class="cl">(Beraisa - Beis Shamai):</span> If one wants to bless on oil and wine, he puts the oil in his right hand and the wine in his left hand; he blesses on the oil, then on the wine;</p>
<p class="bas indent1"><span class="nm">(l)</span>Beis Hillel says, he puts the wine in his right hand and the oil in his left; he blesses on the wine, then on the oil;</p>
<p class="bas indent2"><span class="nm">1.</span>Later, he rubs the oil from his hand onto the waiter's head (we will explain why);</p>
<p class="bas indent2"><span class="nm">2.</span>If the waiter is a Chacham, he rubs the oil on the wall;</p>
<p class="bas indent3"><span class="nm">i.</span>This is because it is disgraceful for a Chacham to go perfumed in the market (i.e. in public).</p>
<p class="bas subject"><span class="nm">5)</span>WHAT IS DISGRACEFUL FOR A TALMID CHACHAM</p>
<p class="bas indent1"><span class="nm">(a)</span><span class="cl">(Beraisa):</span> Six things are disgraceful for a Talmid Chacham:</p>
<p class="bas indent2"><span class="nm">1.</span>He should not go perfumed in the market;</p>
<p class="bas indent2"><span class="nm">2.</span>He should not go out alone at night;</p>
<p class="bas indent2"><span class="nm">3.</span>He should not go out with patched shoes;</p>
<p class="bas indent2"><span class="nm">4.</span>He should not speak with a woman in the market;</p>
<p class="bas indent2"><span class="nm">5.</span>He should not recline (to eat) with Amei ha'Aretz;</p>
<p class="bas indent2"><span class="nm">6.</span>He should not be the last to enter the Beis Medrash.</p>
<p class="bas indent1"><span class="nm">(b)</span>Some say, he should not take a big step or walk upright (arrogantly).</p>
<p class="bas indent1"><span class="nm">(c)</span><span class="cl">(Beraisa):</span> He should not go perfumed in the market.</p>
<p class="bas indent1"><span class="nm">(d)</span><span class="cl">(R. Aba):</span> This is in a place where people are suspected of homosexuality.</p>
<p class="bas indent1"><span class="nm">(e)</span><span class="cl">(Rav Sheshes):</span> This is only if his garment is scented -- we are not concerned if his body is scented, for [people realize that] this is only to counter sweat.</p>
<p class="bas indent2"><span class="nm">1.</span><span class="cl">Version #1 (Rav Papa):</span> His hair is considered like a garment.</p>
<p class="bas indent2"><span class="nm">2.</span><span class="cl">Version #2 (Rav Papa):</span> His hair is considered like his body.</p>
<p class="bas indent1"><span class="nm">(f)</span><span class="cl">(Beraisa):</span> He should not go out alone at night.</p>
<p class="bas indent1"><span class="nm">(g)</span>This is on account of suspicion (that he goes for Z'nus);</p>
<p class="bas indent2"><span class="nm">1.</span>This is only if he does not have a fixed time to learn [from his Rebbi] -- if he does, people know that he goes to learn.</p>
<p class="bas indent1"><span class="nm">(h)</span><span class="cl">(Beraisa):</span> He should not go out with patched shoes.</p>
<p class="bas indent1"><span class="nm">(i)</span>This supports R. Chiya bar Aba:</p>
<p class="bas indent2"><span class="nm">1.</span><span class="cl">(R. Chiya bar Aba):</span> It is disgraceful for a Chacham to go out with patched shoes.</p>
<p class="bas indent2"><span class="nm">2.</span><span class="cl">Question:</span> But he himself went out with patched shoes!</p>
<p class="bas indent2"><span class="nm">3.</span><span class="cl">Answer (Mar Zutra brei d'Rav Nachman):</span> It is disgraceful only if there is a patch on top of a patch.</p>
<p class="bas indent2"><span class="nm">4.</span>This is only if the patches are on the top of the shoe -- if they are on the sole, we are not concerned.</p>
<p class="bas indent2"><span class="nm">5.</span>Even on the top, we are concerned only on the road -- in his house, we are not concerned.</p>
<p class="bas indent2"><span class="nm">6.</span>This is only in summer -- in winter we are not concerned (Rashi - because mud covers them).</p>
<p class="bas indent1"><span class="nm">(j)</span><span class="cl">(Beraisa):</span> He should not speak with a woman in the market.</p>
<p class="bas indent1"><span class="nm">(k)</span><span class="cl">(Rav Chisda):</span> This applies even to his wife.</p>
<p class="bas indent2"><span class="nm">1.</span><span class="cl">Support (Beraisa):</span> This applies even to his wife, daughter, and sister, for people may not know that these are his relatives.</p>
<p class="bas indent1"><span class="nm">(l)</span><span class="cl">(Beraisa):</span> He should not recline with Amei ha'Aretz.</p>
<p class="bas indent1"><span class="nm">(m)</span><span class="cl">Question:</span> What is the reason?</p>
<p class="bas indent1"><span class="nm">(n)</span><span class="cl">Answer:</span> He might get drawn after them.</p>
<p class="bas indent1"><span class="nm">(o)</span><span class="cl">(Beraisa):</span> He should not be the last to enter the Beis Medrash.</p>
<p class="bas indent1"><span class="nm">(p)</span>This is because people will call him a transgressor (lazy).</p>
<p class="bas indent1"><span class="nm">(q)</span><span class="cl">(Beraisa - Some say):</span> He should not take a big step.</p>
<p class="bas indent2"><span class="nm">1.</span>Taking a big step detracts 1/500th of a person's sight.</p>
<p class="bas indent2"><span class="nm">2.</span><span class="cl">Question:</span> If one did so, how can he rectify it?</p>
<p class="bas indent2"><span class="nm">3.</span><span class="cl">Answer:</span> He should drink the wine used to make Kidush on Shabbos night (Rashi; Mishnah Berurah (OC 271:48) - he should look at the candles at the time of Kidush).</p>
<p class="bas indent1"><span class="nm">(r)</span><span class="cl">(Beraisa - Some say):</span> He should not walk upright.</p>
<p class="bas indent2"><span class="nm">1.</span>If one walks upright, even four Amos, it is as if he pushes aside the feet of the Shechinah (Maharsha - which are on top of a person's head) -- "Melo Chol ha'Aretz Kevodo."</p>
