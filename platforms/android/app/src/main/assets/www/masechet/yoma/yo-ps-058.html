<div class="subject"><span class="nm">1)</span><p>COMBINING THE BLOOD (bottom of 57b)</p></div>
<div class="indent1"><span class="nm">(a)</span><p>The Mishnah supports the opinion that the Dam is combined before the Haza'ah on the Mizbe'ach ha'Penimi.</p></div>
<div class="indent1"><span class="nm">(b)</span><p>This is a Machlokes R. Yoshia and R. Yonasan.</p></div>
<div class="indent1"><span class="nm">(c)</span><p>We may infer that R. Yoshia is of the opinion that they must be combined prior to the Haza'ah, since he holds, generally, that items listed together in the Pasuk are to be combined even in the absence of the word "Yachdav".</p></div>
<div class="indent2"><span class="nm">1.</span><p>Perhaps R. Yonasan could also maintain, here, that the blood is combined first, owing to the word "Achas".</p></div>
<div class="indent2"><span class="nm">2.</span><p>This suggestion, however, is clearly refuted by the Beraisa in which the positions of R. Yonasan and R. Yoshia are explicit.</p></div>
<div class="indent2"><span class="nm">3.</span><p>R. Yonasan there rejects the implication of "Achas" in light of the separator term "u'mi'Dam".</p></div>
<div class="indent1"><span class="nm">(d)</span><p>A second Beraisa affirms that Me'arvin li'Keranos is the position of R. Yoshia.</p></div>
<div class="subject"><span class="nm">2)</span><p>CHATZITZAH MIN BEMINO</p></div>
<div class="indent1"><span class="nm">(a)</span><p><span class="cl">Question:</span> What would be the Din if the Kohen put one Mizrak into the other, would it be considered a Chatzitzah (Min be'Mino) or not?</p></div>
<div class="indent1"><span class="nm">(b)</span><p><span class="cl">Answer:</span> Our Mishnah indicates that the one vessel <i>may</i> be placed within the other.</p></div>
<div class="indent1"><span class="nm">(c)</span><p>No, the Mishnah means <i>pouring the contents</i> of (the full) one into the other (empty one), not placing one vessel into the other.</p></div>
<div class="indent1"><span class="nm">(d)</span><p><span class="cl">Question:</span> But the Mishnah already taught that he poured the contents of one into the other?</p></div>
<div class="indent1"><span class="nm">(e)</span><p><span class="cl">Answer:</span> The second pouring is for greater consistency.</p></div>
<div class="indent1"><span class="nm">(f)</span><p><span class="cl">Question:</span> The Beraisa invalidates the Avodah of a Kohen standing on the foot of another, indicating that Min be'Mino <i>is</i> a Chatzitzah!</p></div>
<div class="indent1"><span class="nm">(g)</span><p><span class="cl">Answer:</span> A foot does not become Batel (and is thus not considered Min be'Mino).</p></div>
<div class="indent1"><span class="nm">(h)</span><p>We could understand the question in (a) as follows:</p></div>
<div class="indent2"><span class="nm">1.</span><p><span class="cl">Question:</span> Is it proper to serve Hash-m with one vessel inside the other?</p></div>
<div class="indent2"><span class="nm">2.</span><p><span class="cl">Answer:</span> From the Pasuk we can learn that multiple vessels may (together) effect one (proper) service.</p></div>
<div class="indent1"><span class="nm">(i)</span><p><span class="cl">Question:</span> Would a (fibrous) Siv in a vessel constitute a Chatzitzah (since it is a foreign body- Min bi'she'Eino Mino) or not (since it becomes fully saturated)?</p></div>
<div class="indent1"><span class="nm">(j)</span><p><span class="cl">Answer:</span> We find by the Mei Chatas that whatever is absorbed into the sponge is invalid but whatever is outside of the sponge is Kosher, and so, too, in our case.</p></div>
<div class="indent2"><span class="nm">1.</span><p>We may not draw conclusions from there since water is thinner than blood and more likely will permeate the space between the sponge and the vessel.</p></div>
<div class="indent1"><span class="nm">(k)</span><p><span class="cl">Alternate Answer:</span> The Siv would be acceptable by blood, but not by a Minchah (even fine flour might not permeate).</p></div>

<div class="subject"><span class="nm">3)</span><p>MISHNAH: THE MATANOS ON THE FOUR CORNERS OF THE MIZBEACH</p></div>
<div class="indent1"><span class="nm">(a)</span><p>The Mizbe'ach spoken of in the Pasuk is the Mizbe'ach ha'Zahav.</p></div>
<div class="indent1"><span class="nm">(b)</span><p><span class="cl">(Tana Kama):</span> He begins the Haza'os (in a downward motion) in the <b>NE</b> corner and proceeds to his right (<b>NW</b>, <b>SW</b>, <b>SE</b>). [As such, he concludes his Haza'os in the corresponding corner (<b>SE</b>) to where he begins his Avodah on the Mizbe'ach ha'Chitzon.]</p></div>
<div class="indent1"><span class="nm">(c)</span><p><span class="cl">(R. Eliezer):</span> [Due to the small size of the Mizbe'ach ha'Zahav] He did the Avodah while standing in one place. [All the Haza'os (excepting the closest corner) were done in an upward motion.]</p></div>
<div class="indent1"><span class="nm">(d)</span><p>After the Matanos on the corners he did seven Haza'os on the top of the Mizbe'ach and then poured the remaining Dam on the Western Yesod of the Mizbe'ach ha'Chitzon.</p></div>
<div class="indent2"><span class="nm">1.</span><p>Shirayim from the Mizbe'ach ha'Chitzon would be poured on the Southern side, and all the blood would combine beneath in the Amah, then flow out to the Kidron valley where it was sold as fertilizer.</p></div>
<div class="indent2"><span class="nm">2.</span><p>There is a prohibition (Me'ilah) against use of the Dam without paying for it.</p></div>
<div class="subject"><span class="nm">4)</span><p>WHERE THE KOHEN STOOD FOR THE HAZAOS OF THE PAROCHES</p></div>
<div class="indent1"><span class="nm">(a)</span><p>Two Beraisos teach that, for the Par Chatas of the Kohen Mashiach, the Kohen stands East (outward) of the Mizbe'ach (and does the Haza'ah on the Paroches from there) whereas on Yom Kipur he stands within, West of the Mizbe'ach, while doing Haza'ah on the Paroches.</p></div>
<div class="subject"><span class="nm">5)</span><p>THE STARTING POINT OF THE HAZAOS</p></div>
<div class="indent1"><span class="nm">(a)</span><p>The Beraisa cites a Machlokes regarding the starting corner and the direction the Kohen took around the Mizbe'ach.</p></div>
<div class="indent2"><span class="nm">1.</span><p><span class="cl">(R. Akiva):</span> He began in the <b>SE</b> and proceeded to his left (<b>SW</b>, <b>NW</b>, <b>NE</b>).</p></div>
<div class="indent2"><span class="nm">2.</span><p><span class="cl">(R. Yosi ha'Gelili):</span> He began in the <b>NE</b> and proceeded to his right (<b>NW</b>, <b>SW</b>, <b>SE</b>).</p></div>
<div class="indent2"><span class="nm">3.</span><p>Each opinion begins at the terminus of the other.</p></div>
<div class="indent1"><span class="nm">(b)</span><p><span class="cl">Question:</span> Why, according to both opinions, does the Kohen Gadol bypass the Western corner (North or South)?</p></div>
<div class="indent1"><span class="nm">(c)</span><p><span class="cl">Answer:</span> "ve'Yatza El ha'Mizbe'ach" teaches him to proceed until the exit side of the Mizbe'ach.</p></div>
<div class="indent1"><span class="nm">(d)</span><p><span class="cl">Question:</span> Why, according to R. Akiva, doesn't he circle to the right?</p></div>
<div class="indent2"><span class="nm">1.</span><p>We learned from Rami b. Yechezkel that all turns must be to the right (Mizrach).</p></div>
<div class="indent2"><span class="nm">2.</span><p>This is learned from the sequence of the Pesukim describing the Mikveh of Shlomoh.</p></div>
<div class="indent2"><span class="nm">3.</span><p>Are we to learn that R. Akiva does not subscribe to this rule (and R. Yosi ha'Gelili does)?</p></div>
<div class="indent1"><span class="nm">(e)</span><p><span class="cl">Answer:</span> They argue not about the principle of turning to the right, but over whether we derive the Avodah on the Mizbe'ach ha'Zahav from the Avodah on the Mizbe'ach ha'Chitzon.</p></div>
<div class="indent1"><span class="nm">(f)</span><p><span class="cl">Question:</span> But even granting that R. Akiva does not draw from the Mizbe'ach ha'Chitzon, still, the Kohen should turn to his right, as per the accepted principle!?</p></div>
<div class="indent1"><span class="nm">(g)</span><p><span class="cl">Answer:</span> R. Akiva has the Kohen Gadol going back to the corner which he (ordinarily would not have) bypassed (but did, due to the Pasuk of "ve'Yatza").</p></div>
