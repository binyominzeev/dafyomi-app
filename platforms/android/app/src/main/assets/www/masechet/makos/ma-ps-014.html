<p class="bas subject"><span class="nm">1)</span>A KORBAN FOR EACH <i>ERVAH</i></p>
<p class="bas indent1"><span class="nm">(a)</span><span class="cl">(Beraisa - R. Yitzchak):</span> The Torah taught that (all) Arayos are Chayavei Kerisus, and (superfluously) mentions Kares for Bi'ah with a sister;</p>
<p class="bas indent2"><span class="nm">1.</span>This teaches that it (and all other Chayavei Kerisus) are punishable by Kares, and not by lashes.</p>
<p class="bas indent1"><span class="nm">(b)</span><span class="cl">Question:</span> What do Chachamim learn from this?</p>
<p class="bas indent1"><span class="nm">(c)</span><span class="cl">Answer #1:</span> This Kares individualizes the Arayos, like R. Yochanan taught.</p>
<p class="bas indent2"><span class="nm">1.</span><span class="cl">(R. Yochanan):</span> If one forgot several Chayavei Kerisus and transgressed them (without remembering in between), he brings a Korban for each one. (Since one verse obligates Kares for all the Arayos ("mi'Kol ha'To'evos ha'Eleh v'Nichresu"), one might have thought that they are all considered one Kares, and only one Korban is brought for many transgressions in one Helam (forgetting)).</p>
<p class="bas indent2"><span class="nm">2.</span><span class="cl">Question:</span> What is R. Yitzchak's source to individualize the Arayos?</p>
<p class="bas indent2"><span class="nm">3.</span><span class="cl">Answer:</span> "V'El Ishah b'Tumas Nidasah" obligates for every woman.</p>
<p class="bas indent1"><span class="nm">(d)</span><span class="cl">Objection:</span> Also Chachamim should learn from "v'El Ishah..."!</p>
<p class="bas indent1"><span class="nm">(e)</span><span class="cl">Answer #2:</span> (Indeed, they do. Rather,) the Kares for Bi'ah with a sister teaches that if one has Bi'ah with his sister, and the sisters of his father and mother, he is liable for each one.</p>
<p class="bas indent1"><span class="nm">(f)</span><span class="cl">Objection:</span> This is obvious! They are different transgressions and different women!</p>
<p class="bas indent1"><span class="nm">(g)</span><span class="cl">Answer #3:</span> Rather, it teaches that if one has Bi'ah with his sister, who is also the sister of his father and mother, he is liable (a separate Korban) for each (of the three reasons she is forbidden to him).</p>
<p class="bas indent1"><span class="nm">(h)</span><span class="cl">Question:</span> How can his sister be the sister of his parents?</p>
<p class="bas indent1"><span class="nm">(i)</span><span class="cl">Answer:</span> His father was a Rasha. (Zimri fathered Rachel and Leah from his mother, and he fathered Doson from Rachel. Leah is Doson's (paternal) sister, and she is the maternal sister of his parents.)</p>
<p class="bas indent1"><span class="nm">(j)</span><span class="cl">Question:</span> What is R. Yitzchak's source for this?</p>
<p class="bas indent1"><span class="nm">(k)</span><span class="cl">Answer #1:</span> He learns from a Kal va'Chomer;</p>
<p class="bas indent2"><span class="nm">1.</span><span class="cl">(Beraisa - R. Akiva) Question:</span> If one has Bi'ah with his sister, who is also the sister of his father and mother, is he is liable once, or for each transgression?</p>
<p class="bas indent2"><span class="nm">2.</span><span class="cl">Answer (Raban Gamliel and R. Yehoshua):</span> We heard only the following. If one has Bi'ah with five Nidos in one Helem, he is liable for each woman. All the more so, in your case he is liable for each!</p>
<p class="bas indent3"><span class="nm">i.</span>If he is liable for each when they are the same transgression (Nidah), and all the more so for different Arayos (sister, paternal aunt, maternal aunt)!</p>
<p class="bas indent2"><span class="nm">3.</span>Chachamim reject this Kal va'Chomer. He is liable for each Nidah because they are different women!</p>
<p class="bas indent1"><span class="nm">(l)</span><span class="cl">Objection:</span> R. Yitzchak must admit that the Kal va'Chomer is refuted!</p>
<p class="bas indent1"><span class="nm">(m)</span><span class="cl">Answer #2:</span> He learns from the end of the verse ("Ervas Achoso Gilah").</p>
<p class="bas indent2"><span class="nm">1.</span>Chachamim learn from this that one is liable for a full sister, for we do not punish based on a Kal va'Chomer (we cannot learn from a Kal va'Chomer, if he is liable for a half sister, and all the more so for a full sister!)</p>
<p class="bas indent2"><span class="nm">2.</span><span class="cl">Question:</span> What is R. Yitzchak's source to obligate for a full sister?</p>
<p class="bas indent2"><span class="nm">3.</span><span class="cl">Version #1 (our text, Rashi) Answer #1:</span> He learns liability from the Lav. ("Achoscha Hi" forbids a full sister.)</p>
<p class="bas indent2"><span class="nm">4.</span><span class="cl">Version #2 (Tosfos) Answer #1:</span> R. Yitzchak holds that we punish based on a Kal va'Chomer, therefore it suffices that there is a Lav for a half-sister. (end of Version #2)</p>
<p class="bas indent2"><span class="nm">5.</span><span class="cl">Answer #2:</span> He learns from the beginning of the verse ("Achoso Bas Aviv Oh Vas Imo." 'Achoso' is extra to teach about a full sister).</p>
<p class="bas bbbline">14b----------------------------------------14b</p>
<p class="bas indent2"><span class="nm">6.</span>Chachamim use that 'Achoso' to teach that one who makes oil like Shemen ha'Mishchah and anoints with (the original) Shemen ha'Mishchah is liable twice.</p>
<p class="bas indent2"><span class="nm">7.</span>R. Yitzchak learns like R. Elazar.</p>
<p class="bas indent3"><span class="nm">i.</span><span class="cl">(R. Elazar):</span> Whenever the Torah writes separate Lavim for two transgressions but mentions Kares only once, they are separate regarding Korbanos (if done in one Helem, two Korbanos are brought).</p>
<p class="bas indent2"><span class="nm">8.</span>Alternatively, he does not learn like R. Elazar. Rather, he learns from an extra Kares written regarding Nidah - "v'Ish Asher Yishkav Es Ishah Davah... v'Nichresu."</p>
<p class="bas indent2"><span class="nm">9.</span>Chachamim use this to teach R. Yochanan's law.</p>
<p class="bas indent3"><span class="nm">i.</span><span class="cl">(R. Yochanan):</span> A woman becomes Nidah only if the blood leaves through her Ervah (i.e. to exclude blood that comes out through Caesarian section).</p>
<p class="bas subject"><span class="nm">2)</span>MALKUS FOR A TAMEI WHO ATE KODESH</p>
<p class="bas indent1"><span class="nm">(a)</span><span class="cl">(Mishnah):</span> If a Tamei person eats Kodesh (or enters the Mikdash, he is lashed).</p>
<p class="bas indent1"><span class="nm">(b)</span><span class="cl">Question:</span> We understand why a Tamei who enters the Mikdash is lashed (and is listed with transgressions of Kares):</p>
<p class="bas indent2"><span class="nm">1.</span>The punishment is explicit - "Es Mishkan Hash-m Timei v'Nichresah";</p>
<p class="bas indent2"><span class="nm">2.</span>The Lav (the warning for lashes) is explicit - "vV'Lo Yetam'u Es Machaneihem."</p>
<p class="bas indent2"><span class="nm">3.</span>The Kares for eating Kodesh is explicit - "veha'Nefesh Asher Tochal... ha'Shlamim... v'Tum'aso Alav";</p>
<p class="bas indent2"><span class="nm">4.</span>However, what is the warning against eating Kodesh?</p>
<p class="bas indent1"><span class="nm">(c)</span><span class="cl">Answer #1 (Reish Lakish):</span> It is "b'Chol Kodesh Lo Siga."</p>
<p class="bas indent1"><span class="nm">(d)</span><span class="cl">Answer #2 (R. Yochanan):</span> We learn from a Gezerah Shavah "Tum'aso-Tum'aso":</p>
<p class="bas indent2"><span class="nm">1.</span>It says here "v'Tum'aso Alav", like it says (about a Tamei who enters the Mikdash) "Od Tum'aso Vo";</p>
<p class="bas indent3"><span class="nm">i.</span>Just like there the Torah specifies warning and punishment, also regarding eating Kodesh.</p>
<p class="bas indent1"><span class="nm">(e)</span><span class="cl">Question:</span> Granted, Reish Lakish did not learn like R. Yochanan, for he has no tradition for the Gezerah Shavah.</p>
<p class="bas indent2"><span class="nm">1.</span>However, why didn't R. Yochanan learn like Reish Lakish?</p>
<p class="bas indent1"><span class="nm">(f)</span><span class="cl">Answer:</span> He holds that "b'Chol Kodesh Lo Siga" discusses Terumah.</p>
<p class="bas indent1"><span class="nm">(g)</span><span class="cl">Question:</span> Where does Reish Lakish learn that a Tamei is warned not to eat Terumah?</p>
<p class="bas indent1"><span class="nm">(h)</span><span class="cl">Answer:</span> "Ish Ish mi'Zera Aharon v'Hu Tzaru'a Oh Zav ba'Kodoshim Lo Yochal";</p>
<p class="bas indent2"><span class="nm">1.</span><span class="cl">Question:</span> Why does it say "mi'Zera Aharon"?</p>
<p class="bas indent2"><span class="nm">2.</span><span class="cl">Answer:</span> The verse discusses something that all seed of Aharon (i.e. including women) may eat, i.e. Terumah.</p>
<p class="bas indent2"><span class="nm">3.</span>R. Yochanan agrees that this forbids a Tamei to eat Terumah. He holds that "b'Chol Kodesh Lo Siga" forbids touching Terumah.</p>
<p class="bas indent1"><span class="nm">(i)</span><span class="cl">Question:</span> (Reish Lakish cannot say that "b'Chol Kodesh Lo Siga" forbids a Tamei to eat Kodesh.) He uses it to forbid a Tamei to touch Kodesh!</p>
<p class="bas indent2"><span class="nm">1.</span><span class="cl">(Reish Lakish):</span> If a Tamei touches Kodesh he is lashed - "b'Chol Kodesh Lo Siga";</p>
<p class="bas indent2"><span class="nm">2.</span><span class="cl">(R. Yochanan):</span> He is not lashed. That is a warning not to touch Terumah,</p>
<p class="bas indent1"><span class="nm">(j)</span><span class="cl">Answer:</span> Since it says "Lo Siga", it forbids touching;</p>
<p class="bas indent2"><span class="nm">1.</span>The verse ("b'Chol Kodesh Lo Siga v'El ha'Mikdash Lo Savo"), equates Kodesh to the Mikdash. Just like a Tamei may not enter the Mikdash, he may not eat Kodesh.</p>
<p class="bas indent1"><span class="nm">(k)</span><span class="cl">Question:</span> We need the verse to forbid a Tamei to eat Kodesh before Zerikah (throwing the blood)!</p>
<p class="bas indent2"><span class="nm">1.</span><span class="cl">(Reish Lakish):</span> If a Tamei ate Kodesh before Zerikah, he is lashed. "B'Chol Kodesh Lo Siga" applies before and after Zerikah;</p>
<p class="bas indent2"><span class="nm">2.</span><span class="cl">(R. Yochanan):</span> He is not lashed. A Gezerah Shavah "Tum'aso-Tum'aso" (written regarding the punishment), teaches that one is liable only for Kodesh permitted to Tehorim, i.e. after Zerikah.</p>
<p class="bas indent1"><span class="nm">(l)</span><span class="cl">Answer:</span> Reish Lakish says, "<i>b'Chol</i> Kodesh" includes before Zerikah.</p>
<p class="bas indent1"><span class="nm">(m)</span><span class="cl">Support (for Reish Lakish - Beraisa):</span> "B'Chol Kodesh Lo Siga" forbids eating Kodesh;</p>
<p class="bas indent2"><span class="nm">1.</span><span class="cl">Suggestion:</span> Perhaps it forbids touching!</p>
<p class="bas indent2"><span class="nm">2.</span><span class="cl">Rejection:</span> "B'Chol Kodesh... v'El ha'Mikdash" equates Kodesh to the Mikdash. A Tamei who enters the Mikdash is Chayav Misah (b'Yedei Shamayim, this is included in Kares). The prohibition of Kodesh also entails Misah;</p>
<p class="bas indent3"><span class="nm">i.</span>One is not Chayav Misah for touching,</p>
<p class="bas normal"></p>
