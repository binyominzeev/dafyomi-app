<p class="bas subject"><span class="nm">1)</span>THE ARGUMENT ABOUT KEEPING A PAID LOAN DOCUMENT</p>
<p class="bas indent1"><span class="nm">(a)</span><span class="cl">Answer #3 (Rava):</span> All agree that a lender must validate the document even when the borrower agrees that he authorized it - they argue about whether or not we write a receipt [and force the borrower to pay when he admits that he owes and the lender claims that he lost the loan document]:</p>
<p class="bas indent2"><span class="nm">1.</span>The first Tana holds that we write a receipt (and then the paid document is useless for the lender, since he may not keep it; presumably, the borrower does not want it for a cork, lest he lose the receipt and the loan document will end up in the hands of the lender);</p>
<p class="bas indent2"><span class="nm">2.</span>R. Yehudah holds that we do not write a receipt [lest the borrower lose the receipt and the lender will collect again. If the borrower paid and <i>temporarily</i> accepted a receipt, the lender needs the loan document - if he will not return it, he must return the money.]</p>
<p class="bas indent1"><span class="nm">(b)</span><span class="cl">Answer #4 (Rav Ashi):</span> R. Yehudah says that borrowers keep paid loan documents to show [potential lenders] that they pay their debts.</p>

<p class="bas indent1"><span class="nm">(a)</span><span class="cl">(Mishnah):</span> The Shi'ur for hide is to make...</p>
<p class="bas indent1"><span class="nm">(b)</span><span class="cl">Question (Rava):</span> What is the Shi'ur to be liable for Hotza'ah of hide?</p>
<p class="bas indent1"><span class="nm">(c)</span><span class="cl">Answer (Rav Nachman - Mishnah):</span> The Shi'ur for hide is to make a Kemi'a.</p>
<p class="bas indent1"><span class="nm">(d)</span><span class="cl">Question (Rava):</span> What is the Shi'ur to be liable for tanning hide?</p>
<p class="bas indent1"><span class="nm">(e)</span><span class="cl">Answer (Rav Nachman):</span> It is the same Shi'ur.</p>
<p class="bas indent1"><span class="nm">(f)</span><span class="cl">Question:</span> What is the source of this?</p>
<p class="bas indent1"><span class="nm">(g)</span><span class="cl">Answer (Mishnah):</span> The Shi'ur for the following is a double Sit (as far as one can separate his thumb and index finger, this is twice as much as he can separate his middle and index fingers) - laundering, Menapetz, dying and spinning;</p>
<p class="bas indent2"><span class="nm">1.</span>The Shi'ur for weaving two threads is a Sit.</p>
<p class="bas indent2"><span class="nm">2.</span><span class="cl">Inference:</span> Because laundering, Menapetz and dying are preparations for spinning, their Shi'ur is the same as for spinning - likewise, because hide will be tanned, the Shi'ur for Hotza'ah is the same as for tanning.</p>
<p class="bas indent1"><span class="nm">(h)</span><span class="cl">Question (Rava):</span> What is the Shi'ur for hide that will not be tanned?</p>
<p class="bas indent1"><span class="nm">(i)</span><span class="cl">Answer (Rav Nachman):</span> It is the same - also the Shi'ur for tanned hide is the same.</p>
<p class="bas indent1"><span class="nm">(j)</span><span class="cl">Question (Beraisa):</span> If one was Motzi soaked ingredients [for dye], the Shi'ur is to dye a sample [to show potential buyers of dyed wool] the same size as an Ira (a ball that seals the shuttle holding the woof thread).</p>
<p class="bas indent2"><span class="nm">1.</span>This is less than the Shi'ur for ingredients that were not soaked!</p>
<p class="bas indent2"><span class="nm">2.</span><span class="cl">(Mishnah):</span> The Shi'ur for nutshells, pomegranate peels, Satis and Pu'ah (plants used to make dye) is enough to dye a small garment in the middle of the headdress.</p>
<p class="bas indent1"><span class="nm">(k)</span><span class="cl">Answer (Rav Nachman):</span> This is because people do not bother to soak [less than this, e.g.] the amount needed for a sample.</p>
<p class="bas indent1"><span class="nm">(l)</span><span class="cl">Question:</span> The Shi'ur for unplanted garden seeds is unlike the Shi'ur for planted seeds [used to determine the Shi'ur for other things for their sake]!</p>
<p class="bas indent2"><span class="nm">1.</span><span class="cl">(Mishnah):</span> One is liable for Hotza'ah of less than k'Grogeres of garden seeds;</p>
<p class="bas indent2"><span class="nm">2.</span>R. Yehudah ben Beseira is Mechayev for five seeds.</p>
<p class="bas indent2"><span class="nm">3.</span><span class="cl">(Mishnah - R. Akiva):</span> The Shi'ur for manure or fine sand is enough to fertilize a stalk of cabbage;</p>
<p class="bas indent2"><span class="nm">4.</span>Chachamim say, it is enough to fertilize a leek stalk.</p>
<p class="bas indent1"><span class="nm">(m)</span><span class="cl">Answer (Rav Papa):</span> This is because people do not bother to take out a single seed to plant.</p>
<p class="bas indent1"><span class="nm">(n)</span><span class="cl">Question:</span> The Shi'ur for mud before kneading is unlike the Shi'ur after kneading!</p>
<p class="bas indent2"><span class="nm">1.</span><span class="cl">(Beraisa):</span> Chachamim agree that the Shi'ur for Hotza'ah of waste water is a Revi'is.</p>
<p class="bas indent2"><span class="nm">2.</span><span class="cl">Question:</span> What use is there for waste water?</p>
<p class="bas indent2"><span class="nm">3.</span><span class="cl">Answer (R. Yirmeyah):</span> It can be used to knead mud.</p>
<p class="bas indent2"><span class="nm">4.</span><span class="cl">(Beraisa):</span> The Shi'ur for mud is to make an opening [for a bellows] in a furnace.</p>
<p class="bas indent1"><span class="nm">(o)</span><span class="cl">Answer:</span> One is not liable for less than a Revi'is because people do not bother to knead [less than this, e.g.] the amount needed for a furnace opening.</p>
<p class="bas indent1"><span class="nm">(p)</span><span class="cl">Question:</span> R. Chiya bar Asi taught that there are three hides - Matzah, Cheifah and Diftara;</p>
<p class="bas indent2"><span class="nm">1.</span>Matzah is a hide that was not salted or treated with flour or gallnuts.</p>
<p class="bas indent2"><span class="nm">2.</span><span class="cl">Question:</span> What is the Shi'ur for [Hotza'ah of] Matzah?</p>
<p class="bas indent2"><span class="nm">3.</span><span class="cl">Answer (Rav Shmuel bar Yehudah):</span> It is enough to wrap a small weight.</p>
<p class="bas indent2"><span class="nm">4.</span><span class="cl">Question:</span> What is the size of this weight?</p>
<p class="bas indent2"><span class="nm">5.</span><span class="cl">Answer (Abaye):</span> It is a quarter Litra of Pumbadisa.</p>
<p class="bas indent2"><span class="nm">6.</span>Cheifah is a hide that was salted but not treated with flour or gallnuts.</p>
<p class="bas indent2"><span class="nm">7.</span><span class="cl">Question:</span> What is its Shi'ur?</p>
<p class="bas indent2"><span class="nm">8.</span><span class="cl">Answer (Mishnah):</span> The Shi'ur for [Cheifah] hide is enough to write a Kemi'a.</p>
<p class="bas indent2"><span class="nm">9.</span>Diftara is a hide that has been salted and treated with flour, but not with gallnuts; its Shi'ur is the size to write a Get.</p>
<p class="bas indent2"><span class="nm">10.</span><span class="cl">Summation of question:</span> We said that the Shi'ur for Matzah is enough to wrap a small weight; Abaye explained, this is the quarter Litra of Pumbadisa (this is larger than for tanned hide)!</p>
<p class="bas indent1"><span class="nm">(q)</span><span class="cl">Answer:</span> The Matzah referred to is moist, freshly flayed hide (it is not ready to be tanned).</p>
<p class="bas indent1"><span class="nm">(r)</span><span class="cl">Question (Mishnah):</span> The Shi'urim to receive Tum'as Medras for fabric is three by three [Tefachim]; the Shi'urim for sackcloth, leather and matting to receive Tum'as Medras or Tum'as Mes are, respectively, four by four, five by five and six by six.</p>
<p class="bas indent2"><span class="nm">1.</span><span class="cl">(Beraisa):</span> For cloth, Sak and hide, the Shi'urim for Tum'ah and Hotza'ah are the same (The Shi'ur for hide is five Tefachim - we must say because it was not tanned, the Shi'ur is bigger!)</p>
<p class="bas indent1"><span class="nm">(s)</span><span class="cl">Answer:</span> That refers to cooked, hardened leather for a seat, bed or table.</p>

<p class="bas subject"><span class="nm">3)</span>THE <i>SHI'UR</i> OF <i>HOTZA'AH</i> FOR PARCHMENT</p>
<p class="bas indent1"><span class="nm">(a)</span><span class="cl">(Mishnah):</span> The Shi'ur for Klaf (parchment) is to write the smallest Parshah [in Tefilin, i.e. Shma]. (Hide has two layers, they are peeled apart; the outer layer is Klaf, the inner layer is Duchsustus.)</p>
<p class="bas indent1"><span class="nm">(b)</span><span class="cl">Contradiction (Beraisa):</span> The Shi'ur for Klaf and Duchsustus is to write a Mezuzah (Parshas. Shma and "V'Hayah Im Shamo'a").</p>
<p class="bas indent1"><span class="nm">(c)</span><span class="cl">Resolution:</span> The Beraisa means, to write a Mezuzah (parchment) of Tefilin (each of the four Parshiyos in head Tefilin is on its own parchment).</p>
<p class="bas indent1"><span class="nm">(d)</span><span class="cl">Question #1:</span> Would the Tana call Tefilin 'Mezuzah'?!</p>
<p class="bas indent1"><span class="nm">(e)</span><span class="cl">Answer:</span> Yes!</p>
<p class="bas indent2"><span class="nm">1.</span><span class="cl">(Beraisa):</span> Tefilin straps on Tefilin Metamei hands, the straps by themselves do not Metamei hands;</p>
<p class="bas indent2"><span class="nm">2.</span>R. Shimon ben Yehudah says, R. Shimon is Metaher hands that touch the straps, unless they touched the boxes;</p>
<p class="bas indent2"><span class="nm">3.</span>R. Zakai says, R. Shimon is Metaher, unless they touched the Mezuzah itself.</p>
<p class="bas indent1"><span class="nm">(f)</span><span class="cl">Question #2 (Seifa [<i>of the Beraisa</i>]):</span> The Shi'ur for Klaf is to write the smallest Parshah in Tefilin, i.e. Shma.</p>
<p class="bas indent2"><span class="nm">1.</span>This implies that the Reisha truly discusses a Mezuzah! (Tosfos - the Beraisa contradicts itself regarding Klaf - the Gemara prefers to ask the contradiction between the Mishnah and Beraisa.)</p>
<p class="bas indent1"><span class="nm">(g)</span><span class="cl">Resolution #2:</span> The Beraisa means, what is the Shi'ur for Klaf and Duchsustus? The Shi'ur for Duchsustus is to write a Mezuzah; the Shi'ur for Klaf is to write the smallest Parshah in Tefilin, i.e. Shma.</p>
<p class="bas subject"><span class="nm">4)</span>MAY <i>DUCHSUSTUS</i> BE USED FOR WRITING <i>TEFILIN</i>?</p>
<p class="bas indent1"><span class="nm">(a)</span><span class="cl">(Rav):</span> Duchsustus is like Klaf - one may write Tefilin on it, just like on Klaf.</p>
<p class="bas indent1"><span class="nm">(b)</span><span class="cl">Question (Mishnah):</span> The Shi'ur for Klaf is to write the smallest Parshah in Tefilin, i.e. Shma.</p>
<p class="bas indent2"><span class="nm">1.</span><span class="cl">Inference:</span> This is the Shi'ur for Klaf, but not for Duchsustus!</p>
<p class="bas indent1"><span class="nm">(c)</span><span class="cl">Answer:</span> L'Chatchilah, one should write Tefilin on Klaf (therefore, Duchsustus is not normally used for Tefilin).</p>
<p class="bas indent1"><span class="nm">(d)</span><span class="cl">(Beraisa):</span> A tradition from Moshe from Sinai teaches that Tefilin are written on Klaf, Mezuzos are written on Duchsustus.</p>
<p class="bas indent2"><span class="nm">1.</span>On Klaf, we write on the inner side (that faced the animal's flesh), on Duchsustus, we write on the outer side (that faced the hair).</p>
<p class="bas indent1"><span class="nm">(e)</span><span class="cl">Answer:</span> That is l'Chatchilah (b'Diavad, Tefilin on Duchsustus is Kosher).</p>
<p class="bas indent1"><span class="nm">(f)</span><span class="cl">Question (Beraisa):</span> If one deviated, it is Pasul.</p>
<p class="bas indent1"><span class="nm">(g)</span><span class="cl">Answer:</span> That refers only to writing Mezuzah on Klaf (but Tefilin on Duchsustus is Kosher).</p>
<p class="bas indent1"><span class="nm">(h)</span><span class="cl">Question (Beraisa):</span> If one deviated in either of these, it is Pasul.</p>
<p class="bas indent1"><span class="nm">(i)</span><span class="cl">Answer #1:</span> This refers to writing Mezuzah on the wrong side of either parchment, i.e. on the outer side of Klaf or on the inner side of Duchsustus.</p>
<p class="bas indent1"><span class="nm">(j)</span><span class="cl">Answer #2:</span> Tana'im argue about this (Rav holds like R. Acha):</p>
<p class="bas indent2"><span class="nm">1.</span><span class="cl">(Beraisa):</span> If one deviated in either of these, it is Pasul;</p>
<p class="bas indent2"><span class="nm">2.</span>R. Acha is Machshir.</p>
<p class="bas indent1"><span class="nm">(k)</span><span class="cl">Answer #3 (Rav Papa):</span> Rav holds like Tana d'vei Menasheh:</p>
<p class="bas indent2"><span class="nm">1.</span><span class="cl">(Tana d'vei Menasheh):</span> If one wrote on paper or a rag, it is Pasul; on Klaf, Gevil (the full double layer of hide) or Duchsustus, it is Kosher.</p>
<p class="bas indent2"><span class="nm">2.</span><span class="cl">Question:</span> What did he write?</p>
<p class="bas indent2"><span class="nm">3.</span><span class="cl">Answer #1:</span> He wrote a Mezuzah.</p>

<p class="bas indent2"><span class="nm">1.</span><span class="cl">Answer #3 (to Question r:2):</span> He wrote a Sefer Torah.</p>
<p class="bas indent1"><span class="nm">(m)</span><span class="cl">Support (for Rav - Beraisa #1):</span> (The Reisha taught that hand Tefilin may be used for head Tefilin, but not vice-versa, because [head Tefilin are more Kodesh -] we ascend in Kedushah, we do not descend.) Similarly, if (parchments of) a Sefer Torah or Tefilin became worn, they may not be used for a Mezuzah, for we do not descend in Kedushah.</p>
<p class="bas indent2"><span class="nm">1.</span><span class="cl">Inference:</span> If it was permitted to descend in Kedushah, they could be used for a Mezuzah!</p>
<p class="bas indent2"><span class="nm">2.</span><span class="cl">Suggestion:</span> They [are Kosher for Mezuzah because they] were written on Duchsustus (this shows that Duchsustus is Kosher for Tefilin)!</p>
<p class="bas indent1"><span class="nm">(n)</span><span class="cl">Rejection:</span> No, they were written on Klaf.</p>
<p class="bas indent1"><span class="nm">(o)</span><span class="cl">Question:</span> May one write a Mezuzah on Klaf?!</p>
<p class="bas indent1"><span class="nm">(p)</span><span class="cl">Answer:</span> Yes (according to R. Shimon ben Elazar, Beraisa #1 is like him)!</p>
<p class="bas indent2"><span class="nm">1.</span><span class="cl">(Beraisa):</span> If one wrote [a Mezuzah] on Klaf, paper or a rag, it is Pasul;</p>
<p class="bas indent2"><span class="nm">2.</span>R. Shimon ben Elazar says, R. Meir used to write on Klaf, because it lasts.</p>
<p class="bas indent1"><span class="nm">(q)</span><span class="cl">Retraction:</span> Rav did not say that Duchsustus is like Klaf, rather, that Klaf is like Duchsustus - one may write Mezuzah on Klaf, just like on Duchsustus. (Tosfos - Rav merely said that Klaf and Duchsustus are the same - the Gemara <i>thought that</i> he meant that Duchsustus is like Klaf, to Machshir Tefilin on it.)</p>
