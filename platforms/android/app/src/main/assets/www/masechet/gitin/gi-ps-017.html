<p class="bas subject"><span class="nm">1)</span>TWO <i>SHELUCHIM</i> WHO BRING A <i>GET</i></p>
<p class="bas indent1"><span class="nm">(a)</span>While Rav Yehudah, Rabah and Rabah bar bar Chanah were talking, two Chaverim (Persians, or a nation that corrupted the Persians) took their lamp. Rabah bar bar Chanah beseeched Hash-m: if we do not merit to be under Your protection, please let us be under the Edomites!</p>
<p class="bas indent1"><span class="nm">(b)</span><span class="cl">Inference:</span> This implies that the Edomites are better than the Chaverim.</p>
<p class="bas indent1"><span class="nm">(c)</span><span class="cl">Question:</span> But R. Chiya expounded "Hash-m understood its way, he knew its place" - Hash-m knew that Yisrael could not endure the decrees of the Edomites, so He exiled them to Bavel.</p>
<p class="bas indent1"><span class="nm">(d)</span><span class="cl">Answer:</span> It was better to be in Bavel until the Chaverim came.</p>
<p class="bas indent1"><span class="nm">(e)</span><span class="cl">(Mishnah):</span> If one says 'it was written in front of me' and two say 'it was signed in front of us', it is valid.</p>
<p class="bas indent1"><span class="nm">(f)</span><span class="cl">Version #1 (R. Ami, citing R. Yochanan):</span> It is valid only if the one saying 'it was written in front of me' was a Shali'ach to give the Get, for then it is as if two testify about the writing and two about the signing;</p>
<p class="bas indent2"><span class="nm">1.</span>If the one s saying 'it was written in front of us' are the Sheluchim, it is Pasul.</p>
<p class="bas indent2"><span class="nm">2.</span><span class="cl">Inference:</span> He obligates two Sheluchim who bring a Get to make a declaration.</p>
<p class="bas indent1"><span class="nm">(g)</span><span class="cl">Question (R. Asi - Reisha):</span> If two say 'it was written in front of us' and one says 'it was signed in front of me', it is Pasul,</p>
<p class="bas indent2"><span class="nm">1.</span>R. Yehudah is Machshir (says that it is valid);</p>
<p class="bas indent2"><span class="nm">2.</span>Do you say that Chachamim disqualify even when both who saw it written are holding the Get?</p>
<p class="bas indent1"><span class="nm">(h)</span><span class="cl">Answer (R. Ami):</span> Yes.</p>
<p class="bas indent1"><span class="nm">(i)</span><span class="cl">Version #2 (R. Ami, citing R. Yochanan):</span> Even when the one s saying 'it was signed in front of us' are the Sheluchim, it is valid.</p>
<p class="bas indent2"><span class="nm">1.</span><span class="cl">Inference:</span> He exempts two Sheluchim that bring a Get from a declaration.</p>
<p class="bas indent1"><span class="nm">(j)</span><span class="cl">Question (R. Asi - Reisha):</span> If two say 'it was written in front of us' and one says 'it was signed in front of me', it is Pasul,</p>
<p class="bas indent2"><span class="nm">1.</span>R. Yehudah is Machshir.</p>
<p class="bas indent2"><span class="nm">2.</span>Will you say that Chachamim disqualify only if the one s who saw it written were not holding the Get, but if they were holding it, it would be valid?!</p>
<p class="bas indent1"><span class="nm">(k)</span><span class="cl">Answer (R. Ami):</span> Yes.</p>
<p class="bas indent1"><span class="nm">(l)</span><span class="cl">Objection (R. Asi):</span> Another time, you said differently!</p>
<p class="bas indent1"><span class="nm">(m)</span><span class="cl">Answer: (R. Ami):</span> This latter version is the correct one .</p>
<p class="bas subject"><span class="nm">2)</span>THE DATE ON A <i>GET</i></p>
<p class="bas indent1"><span class="nm">(a)</span><span class="cl">(Mishnah):</span> If a Get was written during the day and signed the (same) day, or it was written at night and signed during the day; or it was written at night and signed at night, it is valid.</p>
<p class="bas indent1"><span class="nm">(b)</span>If it was written during the day and signed at night, it is Pasul;</p>
<p class="bas indent1"><span class="nm">(c)</span>R. Shimon is Machshir. He disqualifies any document written during the day and signed at night, except for a Get of divorce.</p>
<p class="bas indent1"><span class="nm">(d)</span><span class="cl">(Gemara) Question:</span> Why was it enacted to put the date on a Get (of divorce)?</p>
<p class="bas indent1"><span class="nm">(e)</span><span class="cl">Answer #1 (R. Yochanan):</span> This is lest a woman commit adultery, and her husband save her from execution by giving her a dateless Get;</p>
<p class="bas indent2"><span class="nm">1.</span>Since Beis Din would not know whether the Bi'ah was before or after the divorce, they could not kill her.</p>
<p class="bas indent2"><span class="nm">2.</span>Sometimes a man would have compassion to save a wife who betrayed him, e.g. if she was his niece.</p>
<p class="bas indent1"><span class="nm">(f)</span><span class="cl">Answer #2 (Reish Lakish):</span> The date is to enable her to prove from when the Peros (yield) of her property belong to her, i.e. the day he finished writing the Get.</p>
<p class="bas indent1"><span class="nm">(g)</span><span class="cl">Question:</span> Why didn't Reish Lakish answer like R. Yochanan?</p>
<p class="bas bbbline">17b----------------------------------------17b</p>
<p class="bas indent1"><span class="nm">(h)</span><span class="cl">Answer:</span> Adultery is not common. (Chachamim decree only about what is common.)</p>
<p class="bas indent1"><span class="nm">(i)</span><span class="cl">Question:</span> Why didn't R. Yochanan answer like Reish Lakish?</p>
<p class="bas indent1"><span class="nm">(j)</span><span class="cl">Answer:</span> He holds that the husband eats the Peros until the Get is given.</p>
<p class="bas indent1"><span class="nm">(k)</span><span class="cl">Question:</span> According to Reish Lakish, we understand why R. Shimon is Machshir even if the Get was signed the next night (so the date is one day too early. He holds that the husband forfeits Peros from when he writes the Get, even if not yet signed.)</p>
<p class="bas indent2"><span class="nm">1.</span>But according to R. Yochanan, what is R. Shimon's reason?</p>
<p class="bas indent1"><span class="nm">(l)</span><span class="cl">Answer:</span> R. Yochanan admits R. Shimon holds that the date on a Get is due to Peros. He argues  about Chachamim's opinion.</p>
<p class="bas indent1"><span class="nm">(m)</span><span class="cl">Question:</span> According to R. Yochanan, we understand the argument of R. Shimon and Chachamim;</p>
<p class="bas indent2"><span class="nm">1.</span>According to Reish Lakish, what do they argue about?</p>
<p class="bas indent1"><span class="nm">(n)</span><span class="cl">Answer:</span> R. Shimon holds from the writing of the Get until it is signed, she gets the Peros. Chachamim say that he gets them.</p>
<p class="bas indent1"><span class="nm">(o)</span><span class="cl">Contradiction:</span> Elsewhere, R. Yochanan and Reish Lakish hold opposite to their positions here!</p>
<p class="bas indent2"><span class="nm">1.</span><span class="cl">(R. Yochanan):</span> A wife receives the Peros of her property from the day her husband writes a Get;</p>
<p class="bas indent2"><span class="nm">2.</span><span class="cl">(Reish Lakish):</span> The Peros are hers from the day he gives it.</p>
<p class="bas indent1"><span class="nm">(p)</span><span class="cl">Answer:</span> We must switch the opinions (in these latter teachings to match their opinions above. Ba'al ha'Itur - we switch the opinions in the above teachings.)</p>
<p class="bas subject"><span class="nm">3)</span>CASES IN WHICH THE ENACTMENT DOES NOT HELP</p>
<p class="bas indent1"><span class="nm">(a)</span><span class="cl">Question (Abaye - Mishnah):</span> Three types of Gitin are Pasul, but if a woman remarried based on the Get, children from the new marriage are Kesherim.</p>
<p class="bas indent2"><span class="nm">1.</span>(One of the three is a Get without a date.) What did the enactment to put a date on the Get accomplish?</p>
<p class="bas indent1"><span class="nm">(b)</span><span class="cl">Answer (Rav Yosef):</span> L'Chatchilah, she may not remarry with such a Get. (Therefore, scribes and witnesses will not write or sign it.)</p>
<p class="bas indent1"><span class="nm">(c)</span><span class="cl">Question:</span> If he will cut off the date and give her the Get, the enactment does not help! (Beis Din cannot kill her due to the Safek!)</p>
<p class="bas indent1"><span class="nm">(d)</span><span class="cl">Answer:</span> We are not concerned for such swindlers (they are very rare).</p>
<p class="bas indent1"><span class="nm">(e)</span><span class="cl">Question:</span> If the Get does not specify the day, only which Shemitah cycle (within the Yovel cycle), or the year, or the month, or the week, the enactment does not help! (If the adultery was during that period, we do not know which came first, so we cannot kill her!)</p>
<p class="bas indent1"><span class="nm">(f)</span><span class="cl">Answer:</span> If she was Mezanah in the previous period, she will be killed. She receives Peros from the beginning of the next period;</p>
<p class="bas indent2"><span class="nm">1.</span>Even when the day is specified on the Get, we do not know if it was in the morning or afternoon! We must say, the date enables us to kill her if she was Mezanah on a previous day, and she receives the Peros from the beginning of the next period.</p>
<p class="bas indent2"><span class="nm">2.</span>Similarly, when the Get specifies only the Shemitah cycle, or year... it helps for previous or subsequent Shemitah cycles, years...</p>
