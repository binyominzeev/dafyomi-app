<p class="bas subject"><span class="nm">1)</span>A <i>SHOMER</i> WHO INCITED A THIEF</p>
<p class="bas indent1"><span class="nm">(a)</span><span class="cl">Question (Abaye):</span> If the shepherd taunted the thief, telling him that a certain place is protected by so many people, dogs, and slingshots, and the thief stole from there, what is the law?</p>
<p class="bas indent1"><span class="nm">(b)</span><span class="cl">Answer (Rava):</span> That is like taking the flock to a place where wild animals are found. (He is liable for inciting the thief.)</p>
<p class="bas subject"><span class="nm">2)</span>STIPULATIONS OF LIABILITY</p>
<p class="bas indent1"><span class="nm">(a)</span><span class="cl">(Mishnah):</span> A Shomer Chinam may stipulate to be exempt from swearing. A borrower may stipulate to be exempt from paying. A Shomer Sachar or renter may stipulate to be exempt from swearing or paying;</p>
<p class="bas indent1"><span class="nm">(b)</span>Any Tanai contrary to Torah is void. Any Tanai in which the Ma'aseh (the event governed by the Tanai) precedes the Tanai, the Tanai is void;</p>
<p class="bas indent2"><span class="nm">1.</span>Any Tanai that can be fulfilled is valid.</p>
<p class="bas indent1"><span class="nm">(c)</span><span class="cl">(Gemara) Question:</span> Why are the Shomrim's Tanayim valid? They are contrary to Torah. They should be void!</p>
<p class="bas indent1"><span class="nm">(d)</span><span class="cl">Answer #1:</span> Our Mishnah is R. Yehudah, who says that a monetary Tanai contrary to Torah is valid.</p>
<p class="bas indent2"><span class="nm">1.</span><span class="cl">(Beraisa - R. Meir):</span> If one was Mekadesh a woman 'on condition that you have no claim against me for food, clothing or Onah (Bi'ah at regular intervals)', she is Mekudeshes, and the Tanai is void;</p>
<p class="bas indent2"><span class="nm">2.</span>R. Yehudah says, monetary Tanayim (food and clothing) are valid.</p>
<p class="bas indent1"><span class="nm">(e)</span><span class="cl">Question:</span> The Seifa proves that our Mishnah is not R. Yehudah!</p>
<p class="bas indent2"><span class="nm">1.</span><span class="cl">(Mishnah):</span> Any Tanai contrary to Torah is void.</p>
<p class="bas indent2"><span class="nm">2.</span>This is like R. Meir!</p>
<p class="bas indent1"><span class="nm">(f)</span><span class="cl">Answer:</span> Really, it is R. Yehudah. The Mishnah discusses a non-monetary Tanai.</p>
<p class="bas indent1"><span class="nm">(g)</span><span class="cl">Objection (Seifa):</span> If a Tanai follows the Ma'aseh, the Tanai is void.</p>
<p class="bas indent2"><span class="nm">1.</span>This is like R. Meir!</p>
<p class="bas indent2"><span class="nm">2.</span><span class="cl">(Beraisa - Aba Chalifta citing R. Meir):</span> If the Tanai precedes the Ma'aseh, the Tanai is valid. If not, it is void.</p>
<p class="bas indent1"><span class="nm">(h)</span><span class="cl">Answer #2 (to Question (c)):</span> Really, our Mishnah is R. Meir. Here, the Tanai works because the Shomer never obligated himself (to have the full liability of a Shomer. Kidushin is different, for there is no such thing as partial Kidushin.)</p>
<p class="bas indent1"><span class="nm">(i)</span><span class="cl">(Beraisa):</span> A Shomer Sachar can stipulate to be like a borrower.</p>
<p class="bas indent1"><span class="nm">(j)</span><span class="cl">Question:</span> Is this through mere words?!</p>
<p class="bas indent1"><span class="nm">(k)</span><span class="cl">Answer #1 (Shmuel):</span> The case is, he made an acquisition for the extra liability.</p>
<p class="bas indent1"><span class="nm">(l)</span><span class="cl">Answer #2 (R. Yochanan):</span> No acquisition is needed. He obligates himself through the pleasure that he will get a reputation for trustworthiness.</p>
<p class="bas subject"><span class="nm">3)</span>IMPOSSIBLE <i>TANAYIM</i></p>
<p class="bas indent1"><span class="nm">(a)</span><span class="cl">(Mishnah):</span> Any Tanai that can be fulfilled is valid.</p>
<p class="bas indent1"><span class="nm">(b)</span><span class="cl">(Rav Tavla):</span> Our Mishnah is R. Yehudah ben Teima. Chachamim say that even if a Tanai cannot be fulfilled, it is valid.</p>
<p class="bas indent2"><span class="nm">1.</span><span class="cl">(Beraisa):</span> If one divorced on condition 'that you will go up to the sky' or 'that you will descend to the depth (of the ocean)' or 'that you will swallow a reed of 100 Amos', or 'you will cross the ocean on foot', if she fulfills the Tanai (e.g. through using a Name of Hash-m) she is divorced. If not, she is not divorced.</p>
<p class="bas indent2"><span class="nm">2.</span>R. Yehudah ben Teima says, such a Get is valid;</p>
<p class="bas indent2"><span class="nm">3.</span><span class="cl">R. Yehudah ben Teima says, the general rule is:</span> if a Tanai cannot be fulfilled, it is just meant to tease. It is not a Tanai.</p>
<p class="bas indent1"><span class="nm">(c)</span><span class="cl">(Rav Nachman):</span> The Halachah follows R. Yehudah ben Teima.</p>
<p class="bas indent1"><span class="nm">(d)</span><span class="cl">Support (Rav Nachman bar Yitzchak - Seifa):</span> Any Tanai that can be fulfilled is valid.</p>
<p class="bas indent2"><span class="nm">1.</span><span class="cl">Inference:</span> Any Tanai that cannot be fulfilled is void. (Tosfos - one might have thought that the Seifa explains the Reisha: a Tanai contrary to Torah is invalid <i>because</i> it cannot be fulfilled. Rav Nachman bar Yitzchak teaches that this is not so. '<i>Any</i> Tanai that can be fulfilled...' connotes that this is a new Halachah.)</p>
<p class="perekline">PEREK HA'SHO'EL</p>
<p class="bas subject"><span class="nm">4)</span>SHE'ELAH B'BA'ALIM</p>
<p class="bas indent1"><span class="nm">(a)</span><span class="cl">(Mishnah):</span> If Reuven borrowed Shimon's cow and at the same time asked or hired Shimon to work for him, or if he asked or hired Shimon to work and later borrowed it, and the cow died, Reuven is exempt - "Im Ba'alav Imo Lo Yeshalem";</p>
<p class="bas bbbline">94b----------------------------------------94b</p>
<p class="bas indent1"><span class="nm">(b)</span>If he borrowed Shimon's cow and later asked or hired Shimon to work for him and the cow died, he is liable - "Ba'alav Ein Imo Shalem Yeshalem."</p>
<p class="bas indent1"><span class="nm">(c)</span><span class="cl">(Gemara) Inference:</span> The middle clause says 'and later borrowed the cow.' This implies that the Reisha, which says 'at the same time', means precisely at the same time.</p>
<p class="bas indent1"><span class="nm">(d)</span><span class="cl">Question:</span> How is this possible? Shimon is hired as soon as Reuven asks, but the cow is not borrowed until Reuven does Meshichah (takes it to his premises)!</p>
<p class="bas indent1"><span class="nm">(e)</span><span class="cl">Answer #1:</span> The cow was already in Reuven's Chatzer, so no Meshichah is needed.</p>
<p class="bas indent1"><span class="nm">(f)</span><span class="cl">Answer #2:</span> Reuven asked Shimon to begin working for him when he does Meshichah.</p>
<p class="bas subject"><span class="nm">5)</span>LIABILITIES OF THE <i>SHOMRIM</i></p>
<p class="bas indent1"><span class="nm">(a)</span><span class="cl">(Mishnah):</span> There are four kinds of Shomrim: a Shomer Chinam, a borrower, a Shomer Sachar, and a renter:</p>
<p class="bas indent2"><span class="nm">1.</span>A Shomer Chinam swears and is exempt for any loss; a borrower pays for any loss;</p>
<p class="bas indent2"><span class="nm">2.</span>A Shomer Sachar or renter swears if it was broken, taken captive or died, and pays if it was stolen or lost.</p>
<p class="bas indent1"><span class="nm">(b)</span><span class="cl">Question:</span> What is the source of this?</p>
<p class="bas indent1"><span class="nm">(c)</span><span class="cl">Answer (Beraisa):</span> The first Parshah (of Shomrim in the Torah) discusses a Shomer Chinam, the second discusses a Shomer Sachar, and the third discusses a borrower.</p>
<p class="bas indent1"><span class="nm">(d)</span><span class="cl">Question:</span> Granted, the third explicitly says "when one will borrow." However,  perhaps the first Parshah discusses a Shomer Sachar, and the second discusses a Shomer Chinam!</p>
<p class="bas indent1"><span class="nm">(e)</span><span class="cl">Answer:</span> Presumably, the second is a Shomer Sachar, for he is liable for theft or loss.</p>
<p class="bas indent1"><span class="nm">(f)</span><span class="cl">Question:</span> Just the contrary! The first has greater liability. He pays Kefel (double) if he claims that it was stolen (and really, he stole it himself)!</p>
<p class="bas indent1"><span class="nm">(g)</span><span class="cl">Answer:</span> It is more stringent to pay principal for theft, than to swear and be exempt (and pay Kefel if he stole it himself).</p>
<p class="bas indent2"><span class="nm">1.</span><span class="cl">Support:</span> A borrower gets free benefit (presumably, he should be most liable), and he never pays Kefel!</p>
<p class="bas indent2"><span class="nm">2.</span><span class="cl">Question:</span> His benefit is not free. He must feed the animal!</p>
<p class="bas indent2"><span class="nm">3.</span><span class="cl">Answer #1:</span> The case is, the animal grazes in the swamp. The borrower need not feed it.</p>
<p class="bas indent3"><span class="nm">i.</span><span class="cl">Question:</span> The borrower must guard it!</p>
<p class="bas indent3"><span class="nm">ii.</span><span class="cl">Answer:</span> It is guarded by the guard of the city.</p>
<p class="bas indent2"><span class="nm">4.</span><span class="cl">Answer #2:</span> It suffices to say that a borrower gets most of the benefit.</p>
<p class="bas indent2"><span class="nm">5.</span><span class="cl">Answer #3:</span> He borrowed Kelim. (He need not feed them, and they are guarded just by being in his house.)</p>
<p class="bas indent1"><span class="nm">(h)</span><span class="cl">(Mishnah):</span> A Shomer Sachar or renter swears if it was broken, taken captive or died, and pays if it was stolen or lost.</p>
<p class="bas indent1"><span class="nm">(i)</span>We have an explicit source for theft - "v'Im Ganov Yiganev";</p>
<p class="bas indent1"><span class="nm">(j)</span><span class="cl">Question:</span> What is the source that he pays if it was lost?</p>
<p class="bas indent1"><span class="nm">(k)</span><span class="cl">Answer (Beraisa) Suggestion:</span> Perhaps he pays only if it was stolen!</p>
<p class="bas indent2"><span class="nm">1.</span><span class="cl">Rejection:</span> The double expression "v'Im Ganov Yiganev" teaches even if it was lost.</p>
<p class="bas indent2"><span class="nm">2.</span>This is like the opinion that does <i>not</i> say that (we need not expound the double expression, for) the Torah speaks the way people speak.</p>
<p class="bas indent1"><span class="nm">(l)</span><span class="cl">Question:</span> According to the opinion that the Torah speaks like people do, how can we answer?</p>
<p class="bas indent1"><span class="nm">(m)</span><span class="cl">Answer (Chachamim of Eretz Yisrael):</span> We learn from a Kal va'Chomer. Theft is close to Ones, yet he is liable for it. All the more so he is liable if he loses it, for this is close to negligence!</p>
<p class="bas indent2"><span class="nm">1.</span>The opinion that the Torah does not speak like people do says that the verse teaches this, even though we could have learned it from a Kal va'Chomer.</p>
<p class="bas indent1"><span class="nm">(n)</span><span class="cl">(Mishnah):</span> A borrower pays for any loss.</p>
<p class="bas indent1"><span class="nm">(o)</span>The Torah explicitly obligates if it is broken or dies - "v'Nishbar Oh Mes".</p>
<p class="bas indent1"><span class="nm">(p)</span><span class="cl">Question:</span> What is the source to obligate if it is captured?</p>
<p class="bas indent2"><span class="nm">1.</span><span class="cl">Suggestion:</span> We learn from breakage or death.</p>
<p class="bas indent2"><span class="nm">2.</span><span class="cl">Rejection:</span> A person anticipates that such Onesim might happen, but he does not anticipate that it will be captured!</p>
<p class="bas indent1"><span class="nm">(q)</span><span class="cl">Answer #1:</span> It says "v'Nishbar Oh Mes" regarding a borrower and regarding a Shomer Sachar. Just like being captured has the same law as breakage or death for a Shomer Sachar (he is exempt for either), also for a borrower (he is liable for either).</p>
<p class="bas indent1"><span class="nm">(r)</span><span class="cl">Objection:</span> We cannot learn from a Shomer Sachar, who is exempt, that a borrower is liable! (Perhaps the Torah never obligates for being captured.)</p>
<p class="bas indent1"><span class="nm">(s)</span><span class="cl">Answer #2 (Beraisa - R. Nasan):</span> "Oh" includes being captured.</p>
<p class="bas indent1"><span class="nm">(t)</span><span class="cl">Question:</span> We need "Oh" to separate! One might have thought that he is liable only if it breaks <i>and</i> dies. "Oh" teaches that this is not so</p>
<p class="bas indent2"><span class="nm">1.</span>This is not difficult for R. Yonason, but according to R. Yoshiyah, how can we answer?</p>
<p class="bas indent2"><span class="nm">2.</span><span class="cl">(Beraisa - R. Yoshiyah):</span> "If a man will curse Es Aviv v'Es Imo" teaches only if he curses both;</p>
<p class="bas indent3"><span class="nm">i.</span>"Aviv v'Imo Kilel" includes even if he cursed only one of them.</p>
<p class="bas indent2"><span class="nm">3.</span>R. Yonason says, the prefix 'Vov' connotes even one, unless the Torah explicitly says 'together' (like it does regarding Kilayim).</p>
