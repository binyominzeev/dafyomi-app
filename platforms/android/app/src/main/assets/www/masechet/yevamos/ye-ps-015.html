<p class="bas subject"><span class="nm">1)</span>AN ENACTMENT TO UNIFY THE SCHOOLS</p>
<p class="bas indent1"><span class="nm">(a)</span><span class="cl">(Beraisa - R. Yochanan ben Nuri):</span> Whom should we follow (regarding Tzaras Ervah)?</p>
<p class="bas indent2"><span class="nm">1.</span>If we follow Beis Shamai (and allow Yibum), the child is a Mamzer according to Beis Hillel;</p>
<p class="bas indent2"><span class="nm">2.</span>If we follow Beis Hillel, the child is blemished according to Beis Shamai.</p>
<p class="bas indent2"><span class="nm">3.</span>We should enact that the Tzarah do Chalitzah and not Yibum.</p>
<p class="bas indent1"><span class="nm">(b)</span>They were unable to make the enactment in time.</p>
<p class="bas indent1"><span class="nm">(c)</span><span class="cl">R. Shimon ben Gamliel:</span> What should we do for previous Tzaros?</p>
<p class="bas indent1"><span class="nm">(d)</span><span class="cl">Question:</span> If Beis Shamai followed their teachings, we understand this. However, if they didn't, what was his concern?</p>
<p class="bas indent1"><span class="nm">(e)</span><span class="cl">Answer (Rav Nachman bar Yitzchak):</span> He was concerned for the Tzarah herself (not for her children);</p>
<p class="bas indent2"><span class="nm">1.</span>What should we do for Tzaros of Beis Hillel (who remarried without Chalitzah) according to Beis Shamai?</p>
<p class="bas indent2"><span class="nm">2.</span>If we require them to do Chalitzah, their husbands will despise them! We cannot do so, for  "(Torah's) ways are pleasant... its paths are Shalom!"</p>
<p class="bas subject"><span class="nm">2)</span>DID BEIS SHAMAI FOLLOW THEIR TEACHINGS?</p>
<p class="bas indent1"><span class="nm">(a)</span><span class="cl">(Beraisa - R. Tarfon):</span> I desire that a Tzaras ha'Bas will come to my hands. I will marry her (do Yibum. He was from Beis Shamai. This shows that they followed their own teachings!)</p>
<p class="bas indent1"><span class="nm">(b)</span><span class="cl">Rejection:</span> Rather, he said that he will marry her off (to others. Even Beis Shamai did like Beis Hillel).</p>
<p class="bas indent1"><span class="nm">(c)</span><span class="cl">Question:</span> If so, what was his great desire? (Everyone rules like Beis Hillel!)</p>
<p class="bas indent1"><span class="nm">(d)</span><span class="cl">Answer:</span> He desired to demonstrate that we do not hold like R. Yochanan ben Nuri.</p>
<p class="bas indent1"><span class="nm">(e)</span><span class="cl">(Beraisa):</span> It happened that R. Gamliel's daughter married his brother, and his brother died without children. R. Gamliel did Yibum with the Tzarah.</p>
<p class="bas indent1"><span class="nm">(f)</span><span class="cl">Objection:</span> R. Gamliel was from Beis Hillel!</p>
<p class="bas indent1"><span class="nm">(g)</span><span class="cl">Answer:</span> His daughter was an Ailonis.</p>
<p class="bas indent1"><span class="nm">(h)</span><span class="cl">Question (Seifa - Others):</span> She was an Ailonis.</p>
<p class="bas indent2"><span class="nm">1.</span>This shows that the first Tana holds that she was not an Ailonis!</p>
<p class="bas indent1"><span class="nm">(i)</span><span class="cl">Answer #1:</span> They argue about whether or not her husband knew that she was an Ailonis.</p>
<p class="bas indent1"><span class="nm">(j)</span><span class="cl">Answer #2:</span> They argue about whether or not an Ervah forbids a Tzarah if the Ervah was divorced after her husband married the Tzarah.</p>
<p class="bas indent1"><span class="nm">(k)</span><span class="cl">Answer #3:</span> They argue about whether or not Bi'ah may be done on condition (i.e. if she is an Ailonis, Bi'ah should not be Kidushin).</p>
<p class="bas indent1"><span class="nm">(l)</span><span class="cl">Question (Rav Mesharshiya - Beraisa):</span> It once occurred that R. Akiva picked an Esrog on the first of Shevat and took two tithes, one like Beis Shamai and one like Beis Hillel.</p>
<p class="bas indent2"><span class="nm">1.</span>This shows that Beis Shamai followed their own teachings.</p>
<p class="bas indent1"><span class="nm">(m)</span><span class="cl">Answer:</span> (No, R. Akiva wanted to follow Beis Hillel.) He was unsure if Beis Hillel hold that Shevat 1 is Rosh Hashanah for trees, or Shevat 15.</p>
<p class="bas indent1"><span class="nm">(n)</span><span class="cl">Question (Mar Zutra - Mishnah):</span> Shamai's daughter-in-law gave birth on Sukos. He enlarged the Sukah to make room for the baby.</p>
<p class="bas indent2"><span class="nm">1.</span>This proves that they followed their own teachings!</p>
<p class="bas indent1"><span class="nm">(o)</span><span class="cl">Answer:</span> One cannot learn from there, for one who saw would think that he wanted more air.</p>
<p class="bas indent1"><span class="nm">(p)</span><span class="cl">Question (Mar Zutra - Mishnah):</span> There was a stone through which water flowed into a Mikveh; all Taharos in Yerushalayim relied on this Mikveh. Beis Shamai enlarged the hole, since they hold that the majority must be open.</p>
<p class="bas indent2"><span class="nm">1.</span><span class="cl">(Mishnah):</span> Mikva'os may be joined by an opening as big as Shefoferes ha'Nod (the circumference of a hollow reed put into a leather pouch from which one draws out the liquid), i.e. a circle two fingers wide.</p>
<p class="bas indent2"><span class="nm">2.</span>This shows that Beis Shamai followed their own teachings.</p>
<p class="bas bbbline">15b----------------------------------------15b</p>
<p class="bas indent1"><span class="nm">(q)</span><span class="cl">Answer:</span> There, it appeared that they wanted more water to flow.</p>
<p class="bas indent1"><span class="nm">(r)</span><span class="cl">Question:</span> R. Tzadok once sent olives to R. Yochanan ben Hachorani. When R. Yochanan saw that they were wet he said that he does not eat olives. R. Tzadok informed him that they were collected in a punctured basket that became sealed with sediment:</p>
<p class="bas indent2"><span class="nm">1.</span><span class="cl">(Mishnah - Beis Shamai):</span> There is no need to puncture a basket of densely packed olives (the liquid that exudes is not Machshir);</p>
<p class="bas indent2"><span class="nm">2.</span>Beis Hillel says, it must be punctured (to show that he does not want the liquid, for otherwise it is Machshir);</p>
<p class="bas indent2"><span class="nm">3.</span>Beis Hillel agree that if it was punctured and became sealed with sediment, it is not Machshir.</p>
<p class="bas indent2"><span class="nm">4.</span>Even though R. Tzadok was from Beis Shamai, he acted according to Beis Hillel.</p>
<p class="bas indent2"><span class="nm">5.</span><span class="cl">Summation of question:</span> If Beis Shamai followed their own teachings, we understand why it was recorded that R. Tzadok acted like Beis Hillel. However, if they did not, there was no need to say this!</p>
<p class="bas subject"><span class="nm">3)</span>TZARAS ERVAH</p>
<p class="bas indent1"><span class="nm">(a)</span><span class="cl">Question (Beraisa):</span> They asked R. Yehoshua about the law of a Tzaras ha'Bas.</p>
<p class="bas indent2"><span class="nm">1.</span><span class="cl">R. Yehoshua:</span> Beis Shamai and Beis Hillel argue about this.</p>
<p class="bas indent2"><span class="nm">2.</span><span class="cl">The questioner:</span> Whom does the Halachah follow?</p>
<p class="bas indent2"><span class="nm">3.</span><span class="cl">R. Yehoshua:</span> You seek to put my head between two great mountains. I fear to answer, lest they (children whom I say are Mamzerim) kill me! I can testify about two great families in Yerushalayim that came from Tzaras Ervah (who married without Yibum or Chalitzah) and members of these families served as Kohen Gadol.</p>
<p class="bas indent2"><span class="nm">4.</span>If they followed their teachings, we understand R. Yehoshua's fear. However, if not, why was he afraid? (This question is not answered.)</p>
<p class="bas indent1"><span class="nm">(b)</span><span class="cl">Counter-question:</span> Even if they followed their teachings, why was he afraid?</p>
<p class="bas indent2"><span class="nm">1.</span><span class="cl">(R. Yehoshua):</span> A Mamzer results only from Arayos punishable by Misas Beis Din.</p>
<p class="bas indent1"><span class="nm">(c)</span><span class="cl">Answer:</span> Granted, (he holds that) the child (of Tzaras Ervah) is not a Mamzer, but a Kal va'Chomer teaches that his lineage is Pagum (forbidden to Kehunah):</p>
<p class="bas indent2"><span class="nm">1.</span>If a widow marries a Kohen Gadol, even though the Isur is not Shavah b'Chol, the child is Pagum. Tzaras Ervah is Shavah b'Chol, all the more so the child is Pagum!</p>
<p class="bas indent1"><span class="nm">(d)</span><span class="cl">Question:</span> R. Yehoshua was asked about Tzaras Ervah. Why did he answer about the children?</p>
<p class="bas indent1"><span class="nm">(e)</span><span class="cl">Answer:</span> They asked two questions.</p>
<p class="bas indent2"><span class="nm">1.</span>What is the Halachah regarding Tzaras Ervah?</p>
<p class="bas indent2"><span class="nm">2.</span>If the Halachah follows Beis Hillel, if Tzaras Ervah married without Yibum or Chalitzah, what do Beis Shamai say about the children?</p>
<p class="bas indent1"><span class="nm">(f)</span><span class="cl">Question:</span> Why did they ask the second question? (If the Halachah follows Beis Hillel, why are we concerned for Beis Shamai's opinion?)</p>
<p class="bas indent1"><span class="nm">(g)</span><span class="cl">Answer:</span> This teaches about Machazir Gerushaso (after his ex-wife married someone else):</p>
<p class="bas indent2"><span class="nm">1.</span>Do we say that when a widow marries a Kohen Gadol, even though the Isur is not Shavah b'Chol the child is Pagum, and all the more so the child of Machazir Gerushaso is Pagum, for the Isur is Shavah b'Chol?</p>
<p class="bas indent2"><span class="nm">2.</span>Or, perhaps the Kal va'Chomer is invalid. There, the widow herself becomes Pagum. Here, she does not.</p>
<p class="bas indent2"><span class="nm">3.</span>R. Yehoshua testified about Bnei Tzaros (that some were Kohanim Gedolim).</p>
