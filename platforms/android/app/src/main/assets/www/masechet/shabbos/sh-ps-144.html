<p class="bas subject"><span class="nm">1)</span>THE ARGUMENT OF REBBI YEHUDAH AND THE CHACHAMIM</p>
<p class="bas indent1"><span class="nm">(a)</span><span class="cl">Answer #1:</span> No, 'l'Ratzon' means Stam, 'Lo l'Ratzon' means, he explicitly said that he regrets that it exuded.</p>
<p class="bas indent1"><span class="nm">(b)</span><span class="cl">Answer #2:</span> Baskets of strawberries and pomegranates are different - since the liquid [drips out and] goes to waste, from the beginning he makes it Hefker.</p>
<p class="bas indent1"><span class="nm">(c)</span><span class="cl">Question:</span> Indeed, this shows that R. Yehudah agrees to Chachamim regarding olives and grapes;</p>
<p class="bas indent2"><span class="nm">1.</span>What is the source (for Rabah (143B)) that Chachamim agree to R. Yehudah regarding other fruits?</p>
<p class="bas indent1"><span class="nm">(d)</span><span class="cl">Answer (Beraisa):</span> We may squeeze plums, quinces and crabapples, but not pomegranates;'</p>
<p class="bas bbbline">144b----------------------------------------144b</p>
<p class="bas indent2"><span class="nm">1.</span>In the house of Menasiya bar Menachem they would squeeze pomegranates [on weekdays; this shows that it is common to squeeze them].</p>
<p class="bas indent1"><span class="nm">(e)</span><span class="cl">Question:</span> How do we know that this is like Chachamim - perhaps it is like R. Yehudah!</p>
<p class="bas indent2"><span class="nm">1.</span><span class="cl">Counter-question:</span> Even R. Yehudah only [explicitly] permitted what flows from fruits, he did not permit squeezing [on Shabbos]!</p>
<p class="bas indent2"><span class="nm">2.</span><span class="cl">Answer:</span> You must say that because these other species are not normally squeezed, one may squeeze l'Chatchilah.</p>
<p class="bas indent1"><span class="nm">(f)</span><span class="cl">Answer:</span> Presumably also Chachamim permit l'Chatchilah (since one is never liable for squeezing these fruits, there is no reason to forbid! Rashi - Rav Nachman (143B) only said 'presumably', for it is possible that the Beraisa is only R. Yehudah's opinion.)</p>
<p class="bas indent1"><span class="nm">(g)</span><span class="cl">Conclusion:</span> The Beraisa is [even] like Chachamim.</p>
<p class="bas indent1"><span class="nm">(h)</span><span class="cl">(Beraisa):</span> In the house of Menasiya bar Menachem they would squeeze pomegranates.</p>
<p class="bas indent1"><span class="nm">(i)</span><span class="cl">(Rav Nachman):</span> The Halachah follows the house of Menasiya.</p>
<p class="bas indent1"><span class="nm">(j)</span><span class="cl">Objection (Rava):</span> [It is not fitting to say that the Halachah follows <i>him</i> -] he is not a Tana (a Tana merely supported himself by citing Menasiya's practice)!</p>
<p class="bas indent2"><span class="nm">1.</span><span class="cl">Suggestion:</span> Perhaps you mean, the Halachah follows the Tana who [forbids squeezing pomegranates, for he] holds like Menasiya (that it is normal to squeeze them).</p>
<p class="bas indent2"><span class="nm">2.</span><span class="cl">Objection:</span> This is no reason to say that the Halachah follows him - does the majority of the world hold like Menasiya?!</p>
<p class="bas indent2"><span class="nm">3.</span><span class="cl">Answer:</span> Indeed, we find that practices in one region determine the Halachah everywhere!</p>
<p class="bas indent3"><span class="nm">i.</span><span class="cl">(Mishnah - R. Elazar):</span> If one lets cactus grow in a vineyard, this is Kil'ayim, the cactus and nearby vines are forbidden;</p>
<p class="bas indent3"><span class="nm">ii.</span>Chachamim say, only something that people normally grow is Kil'ayim.</p>
<p class="bas indent3"><span class="nm">iii.</span><span class="cl">(R. Chanina):</span> R. Elazar forbids growing cactus because in Araviya people grow cactus for their camels.</p>
<p class="bas indent2"><span class="nm">4.</span><span class="cl">Rejection:</span> Araviya is a whole region - Menasiya is an individual, his opinion is Batul to that of normal people.</p>
<p class="bas indent1"><span class="nm">(k)</span><span class="cl">Answer #1:</span> Rav Nachman holds like Rav Chisda:</p>
<p class="bas indent2"><span class="nm">1.</span><span class="cl">(Rav Chisda):</span> If one squeezed beets and put the juice in a Mikveh, if it changes the appearance of the water the Mikveh is Pasul.</p>
<p class="bas indent2"><span class="nm">2.</span><span class="cl">Question:</span> People do not normally squeeze beets!</p>
<p class="bas indent2"><span class="nm">3.</span><span class="cl">Answer #1:</span> We must say that because he [squeezed it, showing that he] considers it important, it is considered a liquid. (We must say that the Tana of the Beraisa permits squeezing only to sweeten the fruit.)</p>
<p class="bas indent3"><span class="nm">i.</span>The same applies to squeezing pomegranates!</p>
<p class="bas indent1"><span class="nm">(l)</span><span class="cl">Rejection (and Answer #2 to Question (2) - Rav Papa):</span> Beet juice is Posel a Mikveh because one may not make a Mikveh from it (anything Pasul to make a Mikveh is Posel if it changes the appearance).</p>
<p class="bas subject"><span class="nm">2)</span>IS <i>MOCHEL</i> CONSIDERED TO BE A LIQUID?</p>
<p class="bas indent1"><span class="nm">(a)</span><span class="cl">(Mishnah):</span> If wine, vinegar or Mochel [juice from olives] fell into a Mikveh and changed its appearance, it is Posel.</p>
<p class="bas indent1"><span class="nm">(b)</span><span class="cl">Question:</span> Who is this Tana, who considers Mochel to be a liquid?</p>
<p class="bas indent1"><span class="nm">(c)</span><span class="cl">Answer #1 (Abaye):</span> It is R. Yakov:</p>
<p class="bas indent2"><span class="nm">1.</span><span class="cl">(Beraisa - R. Yakov):</span> Mochel is a liquid;</p>
<p class="bas indent3"><span class="nm">i.</span>It was taught that the first Mochel to leave [the olives] is Tahor - this is because he does not want it.</p>
<p class="bas indent2"><span class="nm">2.</span>R. Shimon says, Mochel is not a liquid;</p>
<p class="bas indent3"><span class="nm">i.</span>The reason that Mochel that leaves [at the end, before or after oil was squeezed out of olives in] Ekel Beis ha'Bad (a basket in which olives are pressed) is Tamei is because it surely contains drops of oil.</p>
<p class="bas indent2"><span class="nm">3.</span><span class="cl">Question:</span> [Both Metaher the first Mochel, and Metamei what leaves the Ekel -] what do they argue about?</p>
<p class="bas indent2"><span class="nm">4.</span><span class="cl">Answer:</span> They argue about [the intermediate] Mochel that exudes after the olives became warm and pressed on each other.</p>
<p class="bas indent1"><span class="nm">(d)</span><span class="cl">Answer #2 (Rava):</span> All agree that Mochel is Posel a Mikveh, because one may not make a Mikveh from it, it is Posel if it changes the appearance.</p>
<p class="bas indent1"><span class="nm">(e)</span><span class="cl">(Rav Yehudah):</span> One may squeeze a cluster of grapes into a pot [with food in it - surely, it is for the sake of the Tavshil, not for drinking], but not into an [empty] bowl.</p>
<p class="bas indent1"><span class="nm">(f)</span><span class="cl">(Rav Chisda):</span> This teaches that one may milk a goat into a pot, but not into a bowl.</p>
<p class="bas indent1"><span class="nm">(g)</span><span class="cl">Inference:</span> He holds that if a liquid goes into a solid, it is considered a solid (therefore, it is not forbidden on account of threshing).</p>
<p class="bas indent1"><span class="nm">(h)</span><span class="cl">Question (Rami bar Chama - Mishnah):</span> If a Zav milked a goat, the milk is Tamei [because he caused it to flow].</p>
<p class="bas indent2"><span class="nm">1.</span>[The Mishnah applies does not distinguish, it applies even if he milked into a solid] - if the milk is considered a solid, it is not Mekabel Tum'ah until it is Huchshar [through a liquid]!</p>
<p class="bas indent1"><span class="nm">(i)</span><span class="cl">Answer:</span> Elsewhere, R. Yochanan answered, milk receives Hechsher because it passes over a drop smeared on the nipple - here also, it is Huchshar through a drop smeared on the tip of the udder!</p>
