<div class="subject"><span class="nm">1)</span><p>AN ERUV IN A BENT TREE</p></div>
<div class="indent1"><span class="nm">(a)</span><p><span class="cl">Question:</span> The Mishnah says 'above' and 'below' [10. This implies that one place is directly above the other, i.e. a vertical tree. If it leans, it should have said 'higher' and 'lower' than 10!]</p></div>
<div class="indent1"><span class="nm">(b)</span><p><span class="cl">Answer:</span> After the tree leans outside of four Amos (before it is 10 Tefachim tall), it becomes vertical.</p></div>
<div class="indent1"><span class="nm">(c)</span><p><span class="cl">Question:</span> Even if it is outside of four Amos and above 10, he could take it from there, and carry it over the [horizontal part of the] tree! (When it is below 10, the air above is a Karmelis - Tosfos and old texts of Rashi.)</p></div>
<div class="indent1"><span class="nm">(d)</span><p><span class="cl">Answer:</span> The case is, many people adjust loads (on their backs) on the tree [so it is Reshus ha'Rabim], like Ula taught:</p></div>
<div class="indent2"><span class="nm">1.</span><p><span class="cl">(Ula):</span> If a pillar in Reshus ha'Rabim is nine Tefachim tall and many people use it to adjust loads, if one threw something [four Amos] and it landed on the pillar, he is liable.</p></div>
<div class="subject"><span class="nm">2)</span><p>THE ARGUMENT OF REBBI AND CHACHAMIM</p></div>
<div class="indent1"><span class="nm">(a)</span><p><span class="cl">Question:</span> What is the argument of Rebbi and Chachamim?</p></div>
<div class="indent1"><span class="nm">(b)</span><p><span class="cl">Answer (Beraisa - Rebbi):</span> If an Eruv was in a tree above 10 Tefachim, it is invalid;</p></div>
<div class="indent2"><span class="nm">1.</span><p>If it is [above three and] below 10 Tefachim, it is valid, but one may not take it;</p></div>
<div class="indent2"><span class="nm">2.</span><p>If it is within three Tefachim, one may even take it. (The Isur to use trees on Shabbos does not apply below three);</p></div>
<div class="indent2"><span class="nm">3.</span><p>If the Eruv was put in a basket and hung on the tree, even above 10 it is valid. (This will be explained);</p></div>
<div class="indent2"><span class="nm">4.</span><p>Chachamim say, if the Eruv is in any place from where one may not take it, it is invalid.</p></div>
<div class="indent1"><span class="nm">(c)</span><p><span class="cl">Question:</span> Which case do Chachamim discuss?</p></div>
<div class="indent2"><span class="nm">1.</span><p><span class="cl">Suggestion:</span> They discuss the Seifa. (It is in a basket hanging on the tree.)</p></div>
<div class="indent2"><span class="nm">2.</span><p><span class="cl">Rejection:</span> If so, they forbid Tzedadim (the sides of something forbidden. If so, this is difficult for Rabah (Shabbos 154a), who permits Tzedadim!)</p></div>
<div class="indent1"><span class="nm">(d)</span><p><span class="cl">Answer:</span> They discuss the Reisha. (It is between three and 10.)</p></div>
<div class="indent1"><span class="nm">(e)</span><p><span class="cl">Question:</span> How big is the tree?</p></div>
<div class="indent2"><span class="nm">1.</span><p>If it is less than four by four wide, it is Makom Patur!</p></div>
<div class="indent2"><span class="nm">2.</span><p>If it is [at least] four by four, it should not help if the Eruv is in a basket! (It is in a Reshus ha'Yachid.)</p></div>
<div class="indent1"><span class="nm">(f)</span><p><span class="cl">Answer #1 (Ravina):</span> The Reisha discusses a tree that is four by four. The Seifa discusses a tree that is less than four, and the basket completes the Shi'ur of four [but not within three Tefachim of the ground, for this would make it Reshus ha'Yachid]. Rebbi holds like R. Meir and like R. Yehudah:</p></div>
<div class="bbbline">33b----------------------------------------33b</p></div>
<div class="indent2"><span class="nm">1.</span><p>He holds like R. Meir, who says Chokekim Lehashlim. (It is as if part of the basket was carved out and the tree extends there to complete the Shi'ur);</p></div>
<div class="indent2"><span class="nm">2.</span><p>He holds like R. Yehudah who says that the Eruv must be on a place that is four by four, and we do not have this [without the basket. Therefore, it is essential.]</p></div>
<div class="indent1"><span class="nm">(g)</span><p><span class="cl">Question:</span> Where did R. Yehudah teach this?</p></div>
<div class="indent1"><span class="nm">(h)</span><p><span class="cl">Answer (Beraisa - R. Yehudah):</span> If one inserted a beam in Reshus ha'Rabim and put his Eruv on top of it, it is Kosher only if it is 10 tall and four [by four] wide.</p></div>
<div class="indent1"><span class="nm">(i)</span><p><span class="cl">Objection:</span> Just the contrary! If it is less than this, he and his Eruv are both in Reshus ha'Rabim, so all the more so it is valid!</p></div>
<div class="indent1"><span class="nm">(j)</span><p><span class="cl">Correction:</span> Rather, if it is 10 tall, it must be four wide on top. (The Eruv must be on a place four by four. Even though it is in Reshus ha'Yachid, since we give four Amos to a Me'arev (like Rava, end of 32b), it is as if also he is in Reshus ha'Yachid);</p></div>
<div class="indent2"><span class="nm">1.</span><p>If it is less than 10, it need not be four wide. (It is as if the Eruv rests on the ground.)</p></div>
<div class="indent1"><span class="nm">(k)</span><p><span class="cl">Suggestion:</span> (Ravina says that even though the basket completes the Shi'ur of four, since this is above three Tefachim, it does not make the tree a Reshus ha'Yachid.) This is unlike R. Yosi b'Rebbi Yehudah!</p></div>
<div class="indent2"><span class="nm">1.</span><p><span class="cl">(Beraisa - R. Yosi b'Rebbi Yehudah):</span> If one inserted a pole in Reshus ha'Rabim with a basket (four by four) on top, and one threw something [from Reshus ha'Rabim] and it landed on the basket, he is liable.</p></div>
<div class="indent1"><span class="nm">(l)</span><p><span class="cl">Rejection:</span> It is even like R. Yosi;</p></div>
<div class="indent2"><span class="nm">1.</span><p>There, the walls of the basket surround the pole. (We apply Gud Achis Mechitzta to extend them downward.) Here, the walls do not surround the beam. (We say Chokekim Lehashlim to complete the Shi'ur, but we cannot say Gud Achis in addition to this.)</p></div>
<div class="indent1"><span class="nm">(m)</span><p><span class="cl">Answer #2 (to Question (e) - R. Yirmeyah):</span> (Really, it is four by four.) When the Eruv is in a basket it is valid, Ho'il (since) one could tilt the basket (while it is hanging and bring the Eruv within 10).</p></div>
