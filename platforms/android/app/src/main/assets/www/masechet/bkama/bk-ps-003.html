<p class="bas subject"><span class="nm">1)</span>SHEN AND REGEL</p>
<p class="bas indent1"><span class="nm">(a)</span><span class="cl">Question:</span> Why is a verse needed to show that "he will send" is Regel? What else could it be? We already have verses for Keren and Shen!</p>
<p class="bas indent1"><span class="nm">(b)</span><span class="cl">Answer:</span> The verse must teach that "he will send" is Regel. One might have thought that there are two verses for Shen - one for total consumption, and one for partial consumption.</p>
<p class="bas indent1"><span class="nm">(c)</span><span class="cl">Question:</span> Since we use "he will send" for Regel, what is the source that Shen is liable for partial consumption?</p>
<p class="bas indent1"><span class="nm">(d)</span><span class="cl">Answer:</span> We learn from Regel, in which we do not distinguish whether or not the damaged object is totally destroyed.</p>
<p class="bas indent1"><span class="nm">(e)</span><span class="cl">(Beraisa):</span> "And it will consume" refers to Shen - "like the Galal will consume".</p>
<p class="bas indent1"><span class="nm">(f)</span><span class="cl">Question:</span> Why is a verse needed to show that "and it will consume" is Shen? What else could it be? We already have verses for Keren and Regel!</p>
<p class="bas indent1"><span class="nm">(g)</span><span class="cl">Answer:</span> The verse must teach that "and it will consume" is Shen. One might have thought that there are two verses for Regel, one when the animal goes itself, and one for when it is sent.</p>
<p class="bas indent1"><span class="nm">(h)</span><span class="cl">Question:</span> Now that we use "and it will consume" for Shen, what is the source that one is liable for Regel when the animal goes itself?</p>
<p class="bas indent1"><span class="nm">(i)</span><span class="cl">Answer:</span> We learn from Shen, in which we do not distinguish whether or not the animal goes itself.</p>
<p class="bas indent1"><span class="nm">(j)</span><span class="cl">Question:</span> It should suffice for the Torah to say "he will send", for this connotes both Regel ("sending the Regel") and Shen ("the Shen of animals I will send")!</p>
<p class="bas indent1"><span class="nm">(k)</span><span class="cl">Answer:</span> If there were only this verse, one might have thought that it only teaches one of them, i.e. Regel, for such damage is common, or Shen, for the damager gets Hana'ah.</p>
<p class="bas indent1"><span class="nm">(l)</span><span class="cl">Question:</span> Both are equal Chidushim. We could not learn and exclude the other, so we would learn both!</p>
<p class="bas indent1"><span class="nm">(m)</span><span class="cl">Answer:</span> If there were only one verse, we would obligate the owner only if he sent the animal. The second verse teaches even when the animal goes itself.</p>
<p class="bas subject"><span class="nm">2)</span>IS THERE A <i>TOLDAH</i> UNLIKE THE <i>AV</i>?</p>
<p class="bas indent1"><span class="nm">(a)</span><span class="cl">Question:</span> What are Toldos of Shen?</p>
<p class="bas indent1"><span class="nm">(b)</span><span class="cl">Answer:</span> The animal scratched itself on the wall for pleasure, or it dirtied fruit (by rolling in it or excreting on it) for pleasure.</p>
<p class="bas indent1"><span class="nm">(c)</span><span class="cl">Objection (to Answer #1 (4:b, Daf 2b)):</span> Regarding these Toldos, the animal gets Hana'ah, it is your money and you are responsible to guard it. They are just like Shen! (We cannot say that Rav Papa referred to them!)</p>
<p class="bas indent1"><span class="nm">(d)</span><span class="cl">Answer #2:</span> Indeed, the Toldos of Shen are like Shen. Toldos of Regel are unlike Regel.</p>
<p class="bas indent1"><span class="nm">(e)</span><span class="cl">Question:</span> What are Toldos of Regel?</p>
<p class="bas indent1"><span class="nm">(f)</span><span class="cl">Answer:</span> While it was walking, the animal damaged with its body, hair, saddle-bag, bridle in its mouth, or bell on its neck.</p>
<p class="bas indent1"><span class="nm">(g)</span><span class="cl">Objection (to Answer #2):</span> Regarding these Toldos, the damage is common, the animal is your money and you are responsible to guard it. This is just like Regel!</p>
<p class="bas indent1"><span class="nm">(h)</span><span class="cl">Answer #3:</span> Indeed, the Toldos of Regel are like Regel. Toldos of pit are unlike a pit.</p>
<p class="bas indent1"><span class="nm">(i)</span><span class="cl">Question:</span> What are the Toldos of a pit?</p>
<p class="bas indent2"><span class="nm">1.</span><span class="cl">Suggestion:</span> A 10 Tefachim (deep) pit is the Av. A nine Tefachim pit is the Toldah.</p>
<p class="bas indent2"><span class="nm">2.</span><span class="cl">Question:</span> The Torah never specified the size of a pit!</p>
<p class="bas indent2"><span class="nm">3.</span><span class="cl">Answer:</span> "The dead animal will be (to the owner of the pit)" - Chachamim know that a 10 Tefachim pit kills, a nine Tefachim pit only damages.</p>
<p class="bas indent2"><span class="nm">4.</span><span class="cl">Objection:</span> Still, a 10 Tefachim pit is an Av for death, a nine Tefachim pit is an Av for damage!</p>
<p class="bas indent1"><span class="nm">(j)</span><span class="cl">Answer:</span> The Toldos of a pit (that are unlike a pit) are a stone, knife or load left in a Reshus ha'Rabim (public thoroughfare) that damaged.</p>
<p class="bas indent1"><span class="nm">(k)</span><span class="cl">Objection:</span> What is the case?</p>
<p class="bas indent2"><span class="nm">1.</span>If the owner was Mafkir them (made them ownerless), Rav and Shmuel agree that they are like a pit;</p>
<p class="bas bbbline">3b----------------------------------------3b</p>
<p class="bas indent2"><span class="nm">2.</span>If he was not Mafkir them, according to Shmuel, they are like a pit. According to Rav, they are like an ox;</p>
<p class="bas indent2"><span class="nm">3.</span><span class="cl">Summation of objection:</span> Regarding these Toldos of a pit (according to Rav, this is only when he was Mafkir them), from the beginning they were prone to damage, they were your money and you were responsible to guard them. They are just like a pit!</p>
<p class="bas indent1"><span class="nm">(l)</span><span class="cl">Answer #4:</span> Indeed, the Toldos of a pit are like a pit. Toldos of Mav'eh (this will be explained) are unlike Mav'eh.</p>
<p class="bas indent1"><span class="nm">(m)</span><span class="cl">Question:</span> Which Toldos of Mav'eh are unlike Mav'eh?</p>
<p class="bas indent2"><span class="nm">1.</span>According to Shmuel, Mav'eh is Shen. We proved that the Toldos of Shen are like Shen!</p>
<p class="bas indent2"><span class="nm">2.</span>According to Rav, Mav'eh is man. What are Avos of man and what are Toldos?</p>
<p class="bas indent2"><span class="nm">3.</span><span class="cl">Suggestion:</span> The Av is when he is awake, and the Toldah is when he is asleep.</p>
<p class="bas indent2"><span class="nm">4.</span><span class="cl">Rejection (Mishnah):</span> Man is always Mu'ad (liable to pay full damage), whether awake or asleep!</p>
<p class="bas indent1"><span class="nm">(n)</span><span class="cl">Answer:</span> Rather, the Toldos are his spit and phlegm.</p>
<p class="bas indent1"><span class="nm">(o)</span><span class="cl">Objection:</span> What is the case?</p>
<p class="bas indent2"><span class="nm">1.</span>Before they land, this is like his action (it is just like a man who damages)!</p>
<p class="bas indent2"><span class="nm">2.</span>After they land, Rav and Shmuel agree that they are like a pit (for surely, he is Mafkir them)!</p>
<p class="bas indent1"><span class="nm">(p)</span><span class="cl">Answer #5:</span> Indeed, the Toldos of Mav'eh are like Mav'eh. Toldos of fire are unlike fire.</p>
<p class="bas indent1"><span class="nm">(q)</span><span class="cl">Question:</span> What Toldos of fire are unlike fire?</p>
<p class="bas indent2"><span class="nm">1.</span><span class="cl">Suggestion:</span> They are his stone, knife or load that he left on the roof. They fell in a common wind, and damaged.</p>
<p class="bas indent1"><span class="nm">(r)</span><span class="cl">Objection:</span> What is the case?</p>
<p class="bas indent2"><span class="nm">1.</span>If they damaged as they were falling, this is exactly like fire!</p>
<p class="bas indent2"><span class="nm">2.</span>Another power participates (the wind), they are your money and you are responsible to guard them. This is just like fire!</p>
<p class="bas indent1"><span class="nm">(s)</span><span class="cl">Reiteration of Answer #2:</span> Indeed, the Toldos of fire are like fire. A Toldah of Regel is unlike Regel.</p>
<p class="bas subject"><span class="nm">3)</span>PEBBLES</p>
<p class="bas indent1"><span class="nm">(a)</span><span class="cl">Question:</span> We proved that Toldos of Regel are as Regel!</p>
<p class="bas indent1"><span class="nm">(b)</span><span class="cl">Answer:</span> A tradition from Moshe from Sinai teaches that one pays half-damage for damage caused by pebbles kicked up. This is a Toldah of Regel unlike Regel.</p>
<p class="bas indent1"><span class="nm">(c)</span><span class="cl">Question:</span> Why is this called a Toldah of Regel? (It is independent. It pays half-damage, unlike Regel!)</p>
<p class="bas indent1"><span class="nm">(d)</span><span class="cl">Answer:</span> The obligation to pay is not limited (by the value of the damager, like Regel).</p>
<p class="bas indent1"><span class="nm">(e)</span><span class="cl">Question:</span> Rava never resolved whether or not that is true!</p>
<p class="bas indent2"><span class="nm">1.</span><span class="cl">Question (Rava):</span> Is liability to pay for pebbles limited by the value of the damager?</p>
<p class="bas indent1"><span class="nm">(f)</span><span class="cl">Answer:</span> Indeed, Rava was unsure, but Rav Papa was sure that it is unlimited.</p>
<p class="bas indent1"><span class="nm">(g)</span><span class="cl">Question:</span> According to Rava, why is pebbles called a Toldah of Regel?</p>
<p class="bas indent1"><span class="nm">(h)</span><span class="cl">Answer:</span> This teaches that it is exempt in Reshus ha'Rabim.</p>
<p class="bas subject"><span class="nm">4)</span>MAV'EH</p>
<p class="bas indent1"><span class="nm">(a)</span><span class="cl">Question:</span> What is Mav'eh?</p>
<p class="bas indent1"><span class="nm">(b)</span><span class="cl">Answer #1 (Rav):</span> Mav'eh is man "if Tiv'ayun (you will request)."</p>
<p class="bas indent1"><span class="nm">(c)</span><span class="cl">Answer #2 (Shmuel):</span> Mav'eh is Shen "Niv'u his hidden treasures."</p>
<p class="bas indent1"><span class="nm">(d)</span><span class="cl">Question:</span> How does that show that Mav'eh is Shen?</p>
<p class="bas indent1"><span class="nm">(e)</span><span class="cl">Answer:</span> Rav Yosef translated 'his treasures were revealed.' (Teeth are sometimes hidden and sometimes revealed.)</p>
<p class="bas indent1"><span class="nm">(f)</span><span class="cl">Question:</span> Why didn't Rav learn like Shmuel?</p>
<p class="bas indent1"><span class="nm">(g)</span><span class="cl">Answer:</span> The Mishnah says 'Mav'eh', not Niv'eh.</p>
<p class="bas indent1"><span class="nm">(h)</span><span class="cl">Question:</span> Why didn't Shmuel learn like Rav?</p>
<p class="bas indent1"><span class="nm">(i)</span><span class="cl">Answer:</span> The Mishnah says Mav'eh, not Bo'eh.</p>
<p class="bas indent1"><span class="nm">(j)</span><span class="cl">Question:</span> The verses do not adjudicate like Rav or Shmuel. Why didn't Rav learn as Shmuel?</p>
<p class="bas indent1"><span class="nm">(k)</span><span class="cl">Answer:</span> The Mishnah says 'ox.' This includes all damages of an ox.</p>
<p class="bas indent1"><span class="nm">(l)</span><span class="cl">Question:</span> Why does Shmuel argue?</p>
<p class="bas indent1"><span class="nm">(m)</span><span class="cl">Answer #1 (Rav Yehudah):</span> 'Ox' teaches Keren. Mav'eh teaches Shen.</p>
