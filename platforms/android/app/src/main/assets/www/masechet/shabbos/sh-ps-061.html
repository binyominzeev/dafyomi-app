<p class="bas indent1"><span class="nm">(a)</span><span class="cl">(Mishnah):</span> One may not go out with [only] one sandal unless there is a wound on his foot [otherwise, people might suspect that he is carrying the other shoe under his garment; alternatively, perhaps people will laugh at him, and he will take off the shoe and carry it].</p>
<p class="bas indent1"><span class="nm">(b)</span><span class="cl">Question:</span> If there is a wound on his foot, he may wear one shoe - on which foot does he wear it?</p>
<p class="bas indent1"><span class="nm">(c)</span><span class="cl">Answer #1 (Rav Huna):</span> He wears it on the wounded foot.</p>
<p class="bas indent1"><span class="nm">(d)</span><span class="cl">Inference:</span> He holds that sandals are [normally] worn to avoid pain. (The bare foot shows that he has hard feet and is not pained by walking on bumpy surfaces, people will realize that the covered foot is wounded, they will not suspect him; alternatively, he will bear the ridicule and keep the shoe on to avoid pain.)</p>
<p class="bas indent1"><span class="nm">(e)</span><span class="cl">Answer #2 (Chiya bar Rav):</span> He wears it on the healthy foot.</p>
<p class="bas indent1"><span class="nm">(f)</span><span class="cl">Inference:</span> He holds that sandals are worn for comfort. (People realize that he would like to wear sandals on both feet, but the wound prevents him, they will not suspect him; alternatively, they will not laugh at him because they see the wound.)</p>
<p class="bas indent1"><span class="nm">(g)</span>An episode shows that R. Yochanan holds like Rav Huna:</p>
<p class="bas indent2"><span class="nm">1.</span>R. Shemen bar Aba was bringing R. Yochanan's shoes to him to wear - he [first] gave to him the right shoe (R. Yochanan always donned the left shoe first).</p>
<p class="bas indent2"><span class="nm">2.</span><span class="cl">R. Yochanan:</span> You make it appear that it (my right foot) is wounded [hence I should put a shoe only on it]!</p>
<p class="bas indent1"><span class="nm">(h)</span><span class="cl">Rejection:</span> Perhaps he holds like R. Chiya - he means, you make it appear that my left foot is wounded.</p>
<p class="bas indent1"><span class="nm">(i)</span>R. Yochanan is consistent with what he taught elsewhere:</p>
<p class="bas indent2"><span class="nm">1.</span>Just like we put Tefilin on the left hand, we put the left shoe on first [to show preference for the left].</p>
<p class="bas indent1"><span class="nm">(j)</span><span class="cl">Question (Beraisa):</span> One puts on the right shoe before the left.</p>
<p class="bas indent1"><span class="nm">(k)</span><span class="cl">(Rav Yosef):</span> Since the Beraisa and R. Yochanan say differently, one may conduct like either of them. (Tosfos - they do not argue - one may show preference for the left, like the Torah does regarding Tefilin, or for the right, like it does regarding Chalitzah and blood of Asham Metzora.)</p>
<p class="bas indent1"><span class="nm">(l)</span><span class="cl">Objection: (Abaye):</span> Perhaps they argue - R. Yochanan never heard the Beraisa, had he heard it he would have retracted!</p>
<p class="bas indent2"><span class="nm">1.</span>Alternatively, perhaps he heard it, but he knew that the Halachah does not follow it!</p>
<p class="bas indent1"><span class="nm">(m)</span><span class="cl">(Rav Nachman bar Yitzchak):</span> One who fears Shamayim will fulfill both opinions - Mar brei d'Ravina is such a person.</p>
<p class="bas indent1"><span class="nm">(n)</span><span class="cl">Question:</span> How does one fulfill both opinions?</p>
<p class="bas indent1"><span class="nm">(o)</span><span class="cl">Answer:</span> One puts on the right shoe, then the left, then ties the left, then ties the right.</p>
<p class="bas indent1"><span class="nm">(p)</span><span class="cl">Rav Ashi:</span> I saw that Rav Kahana was not particular [about which shoe he put on first].</p>
<p class="bas indent1"><span class="nm">(q)</span><span class="cl">(Beraisa):</span> One puts on the right shoe before the left; when removing them, he removes the left shoe first.</p>
<p class="bas indent1"><span class="nm">(r)</span>One washes or anoints the right [hand] before the left;</p>
<p class="bas indent1"><span class="nm">(s)</span>When washing the whole body, one should wash the head first, for it is the king over all the limbs.</p>
<p class="bas subject"><span class="nm">2)</span>GOING OUT WITH TEFILIN</p>
<p class="bas indent1"><span class="nm">(a)</span><span class="cl">(Mishnah):</span> One may not go out with Tefilin.</p>
<p class="bas indent1"><span class="nm">(b)</span><span class="cl">Version #1 (Rav Safra):</span> This is not only according to the opinion that [the Mitzvah to wear] Tefilin does not apply on Shabbos;</p>
<p class="bas indent2"><span class="nm">1.</span>Rather, even the opinion that it applies on Shabbos forbids, lest he will [remove them to go to the bathroom and] carry them in Reshus ha'Rabim.</p>
<p class="bas indent1"><span class="nm">(c)</span><span class="cl">Version #2 (Seifa):</span> If one went out with any of these, he is exempt.</p>
<p class="bas indent2"><span class="nm">1.</span><span class="cl">(Rav Safra):</span> This is not only according to the opinion that Tefilin applies on Shabbos - rather, even the opinion that it does not apply on Shabbos exempts.</p>
<p class="bas indent2"><span class="nm">2.</span><span class="cl">Question:</span> What is the reason?</p>
<p class="bas indent2"><span class="nm">3.</span><span class="cl">Answer:</span> This is considered wearing (it is not considered carrying).</p>
<p class="bas subject"><span class="nm">3)</span>A KEMI'A OF A MUMCHEH IS PERMITTED</p>
<p class="bas indent1"><span class="nm">(a)</span><span class="cl">(Mishnah):</span> One may not go out with a Kemi'a that is not [Muchzak to heal, i.e.] from a Mumcheh.</p>
<p class="bas indent1"><span class="nm">(b)</span><span class="cl">(Rav Papa):</span> We do not require the Kemi'a and its author to be Mumchim - it suffices if the author is Mumcheh, even if the Kemi'a is not.</p>
<p class="bas indent1"><span class="nm">(c)</span><span class="cl">Support:</span> The Mishnah forbids 'A Kemi'a that is not <i>from</i> a Mumcheh', it does not say 'that is not Mumcheh'.</p>
<p class="bas indent1"><span class="nm">(d)</span><span class="cl">(Beraisa #1):</span> A Kemi'a is Mumcheh if it healed three times - this applies equally to a Kemi'a of writing or of herbs, and whether or not the Choleh was dangerously sick.</p>
<p class="bas indent1"><span class="nm">(e)</span>Not only is it permitted for one who has had epileptic fits, it is permitted even to prevent them (for one from a family afflicted by this).</p>
<p class="bas indent1"><span class="nm">(f)</span>One may tie and untie the Kemi'a [around the herbs or writing] even in Reshus ha'Rabim;</p>
<p class="bas indent2"><span class="nm">1.</span>One may not tie it on a [leg] bracelet or ring and wear it in Reshus ha'Rabim, on account of Mar'is ha'Ayin (it looks like he wears it for a Tachshit)</p>
<p class="bas bbbline">61b----------------------------------------61b</p>
<p class="bas indent1"><span class="nm">(g)</span><span class="cl">Version #1 (Rashi) Contradiction (Beraisa #2):</span> A Kemi'a is Mumcheh if it healed three people (i.e. with different maladies - Beraisa #1 does not require this).</p>
<p class="bas indent1"><span class="nm">(h)</span><span class="cl">Version #2 (Tosfos) Contradiction (Beraisa #2):</span> A Kemi'a is Mumcheh if [three Kemi'im with] its text healed three people at the same time. (end of Version #2)</p>
<p class="bas indent1"><span class="nm">(i)</span><span class="cl">Answer:</span> Beraisa #2 discusses to Machzik the author (to be Mumcheh), Beraisa #1 discusses Hachzakas Kemi'a. (Rashi - an author is Mumcheh if it is Muchzak that any Kemi'a he writes will heal; Tosfos - he is Mumcheh for a text if it is Muchzak that when he writes it, it heals. Rashi, according to Tosfos ha'Rosh - if Reuven wrote a Kemi'a and it healed Shimon three times, the text is Mumcheh only if Reuven writes it; if it healed three people, or if three doctors wrote this text and each of them healed Shimon, it is Mumcheh no matter who writes it.)</p>
<p class="bas indent1"><span class="nm">(j)</span><span class="cl">(Rav Papa):</span> It is obvious to me that if Reuven wrote three [different] Kemi'im for three people (with different maladies - Rashi; Tosfos - three identical Kemi'im for one person) and each healed three times, he and the Kemi'im are [Muchzakim to be] Mumchim;</p>
<p class="bas indent2"><span class="nm">1.</span>If he wrote three Kemi'im for three people and each healed once, he is Mumcheh, the Kemi'im are not;</p>
<p class="bas indent2"><span class="nm">2.</span>If he wrote one Kemi'a and it healed three people, it is Mumcheh, he is not;</p>
<p class="bas indent1"><span class="nm">(k)</span><span class="cl">Question (Rav Papa):</span> If he wrote three Kemi'im and all healed one person, what is the law?</p>
<p class="bas indent2"><span class="nm">1.</span>Surely, the Kemi'a is not Mumcheh - is the author Mumcheh?</p>
<p class="bas indent2"><span class="nm">2.</span>Perhaps he is Mumcheh because he healed three times;</p>
<p class="bas indent2"><span class="nm">3.</span>Or, perhaps he is not Mumcheh, all worked because the patient has a Mazel (angel appointed over his illnesses) to be cured through writing!</p>

<p class="bas subject"><span class="nm">4)</span>KEDUSHAH OF KEMI'IM</p>

<p class="bas indent2"><span class="nm">1.</span><span class="cl">Question:</span> Regarding what do we ask?</p>
<p class="bas indent2"><span class="nm">2.</span><span class="cl">Answer #1:</span> We ask whether or not one may save it from a fire [on Shabbos].</p>
<p class="bas indent2"><span class="nm">3.</span><span class="cl">Rejection:</span> A Mishnah teaches this - [written] Berachos and Kemi'im, even though they have letters [of Hash-m's name] and verses from many Parshiyos, they may not be saved from a fire [by taking them to a Chatzer lacking an Eiruv], one leaves them to be burned.</p>
<p class="bas indent2"><span class="nm">4.</span><span class="cl">Answer #2:</span> We ask whether they need Genizah (burial - or, perhaps one may dispose of them in any way).</p>
<p class="bas indent2"><span class="nm">5.</span><span class="cl">Rejection:</span> A Beraisa teaches this - if Hash-m's name was written on the handle of a Kli or the leg of a bed, one cuts off the part containing His name and buries it (but the rest of the Kli is permitted - surely, the same applies to Kemi'im).</p>
<p class="bas indent2"><span class="nm">6.</span><span class="cl">Answer #3:</span> We ask whether or not one may enter a Beis ha'Kisei with it - this is permitted only if it has no Kedushah.</p>
<p class="bas indent1"><span class="nm">(b)</span><span class="cl">Answer (Mishnah):</span> One may not go out with a Kemi'a that is not from a Mumcheh.</p>
<p class="bas indent2"><span class="nm">1.</span><span class="cl">Inference:</span> One may go out with a Kemi'a from a Mumcheh.</p>
<p class="bas indent2"><span class="nm">2.</span>If one may not enter a Beis ha'Kisei with it, we should forbid, lest one will remove them to enter a Beis ha'Kisei and carry them four Amos in Reshus ha'Rabim (we learned that even if Tefilin apply on Shabbos, one may not go out with them for this reason)!</p>
<p class="bas indent1"><span class="nm">(c)</span><span class="cl">Objection #1:</span> [Perhaps] only a [Mumcheh] Kemi'a of herbs is permitted (but one of writing is forbidden for this reason)!</p>
<p class="bas indent1"><span class="nm">(d)</span><span class="cl">Rejection (Beraisa):</span> The laws of a Kemi'a of herbs and one of writing are the same.</p>
<p class="bas indent1"><span class="nm">(e)</span><span class="cl">Objection #2:</span> [Perhaps] a [Mumcheh] Kemi'a is permitted only for a dangerously sick person!</p>
<p class="bas indent1"><span class="nm">(f)</span><span class="cl">Rejection (Beraisa):</span> The law of a Kemi'a is the same whether or not the Choleh is dangerously sick.</p>
<p class="bas indent1"><span class="nm">(g)</span><span class="cl">Objection #3:</span> Since a [Mumcheh] Kemi'a heals, one may even carry it in his hand (therefore, even if he will remove it to enter a Beis ha'Kisei, he will not transgress)!</p>
