<p class="bas subject"><span class="nm">1)</span>GIVING HER TO DRINK</p>
<p class="bas indent1"><span class="nm">(a)</span><span class="cl">(Mishnah):</span> If she says that she is Tehorah, we bring her up to the east gate.</p>
<p class="bas indent1"><span class="nm">(b)</span><span class="cl">Question:</span> She is already there!</p>
<p class="bas indent1"><span class="nm">(c)</span><span class="cl">Answer:</span> We take her down and return her, to weary her (it may help induce her to confess).</p>
<p class="bas indent2"><span class="nm">1.</span><span class="cl">(Beraisa - R. Shimon ben Elazar):</span> Beis Din takes witnesses (in a capital case) from place to place. Perhaps they will be befuddled, and will retract.</p>
<p class="bas indent1"><span class="nm">(d)</span><span class="cl">(Mishnah):</span> There, Sotos drink...</p>
<p class="bas indent1"><span class="nm">(e)</span><span class="cl">Question:</span> We know why Sotos drink there - "the Kohen will stand the woman before Hash-m."</p>
<p class="bas indent2"><span class="nm">1.</span><span class="cl">Question:</span> Why does a woman who gave birth stand there?</p>
<p class="bas indent1"><span class="nm">(f)</span><span class="cl">Answer:</span> One should be present when his Korban is offered.</p>
<p class="bas indent2"><span class="nm">1.</span><span class="cl">(Beraisa):</span> A Korban is only offered if the owner is present.</p>
<p class="bas indent1"><span class="nm">(g)</span><span class="cl">Objection:</span> If so, the same should apply regarding a Zav!</p>
<p class="bas indent1"><span class="nm">(h)</span><span class="cl">Answer:</span> It does! The Mishnah gave just one example.</p>
<p class="bas subject"><span class="nm">2)</span>DOING TWO <i>MITZVOS </i>AT ONCE</p>
<p class="bas indent1"><span class="nm">(a)</span><span class="cl">(Beraisa):</span> We do not give two Sotos to drink at the same time, lest one will be encouraged to drink when she sees the other drink;</p>
<p class="bas indent1"><span class="nm">(b)</span><span class="cl">R. Yehudah:</span> No. It is because the Torah says "her" - alone.</p>
<p class="bas indent1"><span class="nm">(c)</span><span class="cl">Question:</span> Why doesn't the first Tana learn from "her"?</p>
<p class="bas indent1"><span class="nm">(d)</span><span class="cl">Answer:</span> The first Tana is R. Shimon, who derives laws from the reasons for Mitzvos.</p>
<p class="bas indent2"><span class="nm">1.</span>He explains that the Torah said "her" to teach that she drinks alone, lest she encourage another woman to drink.</p>
<p class="bas indent1"><span class="nm">(e)</span><span class="cl">Question:</span> What difference does it make if he expounds the reason? (How does this affect the law?)</p>
<p class="bas indent1"><span class="nm">(f)</span><span class="cl">Answer:</span> This affects one who is terrified (and unable to confess. R. Shimon permits her to drink with another woman.)</p>
<p class="bas indent1"><span class="nm">(g)</span><span class="cl">Question:</span> Even in such a case two women may not drink together. We do not do Mitzvos in bundles!</p>
<p class="bas indent2"><span class="nm">1.</span><span class="cl">(Beraisa):</span> We do not give two Sotos to drink at once. We are not Metaher two Metzora'im at once. We do not pierce the ears of two slaves (who refuse to go free) at once. We do not behead two calves (to atone for murdered corpses found) at once. (All of these are because) we do not do Mitzvos in bundles.</p>
<p class="bas indent1"><span class="nm">(h)</span><span class="cl">Answer (Abaye):</span> We distinguish between one Kohen and two. (Rashi - one Kohen may not give two Sotos to drink at once. Each of two Kohanim may give a Sotah to drink at once (according to R. Shimon, if one of them is terrified). The Rambam explains oppositely (Magen Avraham 147:11).)</p>
<p class="bas indent1"><span class="nm">(i)</span><span class="cl">(Mishnah):</span> The Kohen grabs her garments...</p>
<p class="bas indent1"><span class="nm">(j)</span><span class="cl">(Beraisa):</span> It says "he will uncover her hair." "Of the woman" is extra, to teach that he also bares her body.</p>
<p class="bas indent1"><span class="nm">(k)</span><span class="cl">Question:</span> If so, why does it say (only) "he will uncover her hair"?</p>
<p class="bas indent1"><span class="nm">(l)</span><span class="cl">Answer:</span> This teaches that he also opens her locks.</p>
<p class="bas subject"><span class="nm">3)</span>CONCERN FOR AROUSAL</p>
<p class="bas indent1"><span class="nm">(a)</span><span class="cl">(Mishnah):</span> R. Yehudah says, if her heart is attractive...</p>
<p class="bas indent1"><span class="nm">(b)</span><span class="cl">Inference:</span> R. Yehudah is concerned lest this arouse onlookers, and Chachamim are not concerned.</p>
<p class="bas indent1"><span class="nm">(c)</span><span class="cl">Contradiction (Beraisa - R. Yehudah):</span> We cover a man (who will be stoned) in one place, in front. We cover a woman in front and in back, for her genitals may be seen from both sides;</p>
<p class="bas indent2"><span class="nm">1.</span>Chachamim say, we stone a man naked (i.e. with only one covering), but a woman is stoned clothed.</p>
<p class="bas indent1"><span class="nm">(d)</span><span class="cl">Answer (Rabah):</span> Here, R. Yehudah is concerned lest young Kohanim be aroused to desire her, lest she drink and survive. When she is about to be stoned, there is no concern.</p>
<p class="bas indent2"><span class="nm">1.</span><span class="cl">Suggestion:</span> We should be concerned lest they come to desire other women!</p>
<p class="bas indent2"><span class="nm">2.</span><span class="cl">Rejection:</span> Rava taught that the Yetzer Ra incites one only for what he has seen.</p>
<p class="bas indent1"><span class="nm">(e)</span><span class="cl">(Rava):</span> This answers only the contradiction in R. Yehudah. We must answer also for Chachamim!</p>
<p class="bas bbbline">8b----------------------------------------8b</p>
<p class="bas indent1"><span class="nm">(f)</span><span class="cl">Completion of Answer (Rava):</span> Here Chachamim are not concerned for arousal, because we must fulfill "all the women will be chastised";</p>
<p class="bas indent2"><span class="nm">1.</span>When one is stoned, that itself is the best admonition!</p>
<p class="bas indent1"><span class="nm">(g)</span><span class="cl">Suggestion:</span> They will be chastised even more if we stone her unclothed!</p>
<p class="bas indent1"><span class="nm">(h)</span><span class="cl">Rejection (Rav Nachman):</span> "Love your fellow man like yourself" - choose a nice death for him.</p>
<p class="bas indent1"><span class="nm">(i)</span><span class="cl">Suggestion:</span> The Tana'im argue about this. Chachamim hold like Rav Nachman, and R. Yehudah does not!</p>
<p class="bas indent1"><span class="nm">(j)</span><span class="cl">Rejection:</span> No, all hold like Rav Nachman;</p>
<p class="bas indent2"><span class="nm">1.</span>R. Yehudah says, she prefers to minimize pain (she is stoned naked so she dies sooner). Chachamim say, she prefers to minimize her disgrace.</p>
<p class="bas subject"><span class="nm">4)</span>DISGRACING HER</p>
<p class="bas indent1"><span class="nm">(a)</span><span class="cl">(Mishnah):</span> If she was dressed in white clothing, she must change to black clothing...</p>
<p class="bas indent1"><span class="nm">(b)</span><span class="cl">(Beraisa):</span> If she is attractive in black clothing; they cover her in repulsive clothing.</p>
<p class="bas indent1"><span class="nm">(c)</span><span class="cl">(Mishnah):</span> If she was wearing gold jewelry...</p>
<p class="bas indent1"><span class="nm">(d)</span><span class="cl">Question:</span> This is obvious! We disgrace her. Certainly, we do not allow her to adorn herself!</p>
<p class="bas indent1"><span class="nm">(e)</span><span class="cl">Answer:</span> One might have thought that it is a greater disgrace to be naked with jewelry. The Mishnah teaches that this is not so.</p>
<p class="bas indent1"><span class="nm">(f)</span><span class="cl">(Mishnah):</span> He brings a Mitzri rope...</p>
<p class="bas indent1"><span class="nm">(g)</span><span class="cl">Question (R. Aba):</span> Is a Mitzri rope Me'akev (indispensable)?</p>
<p class="bas indent2"><span class="nm">1.</span>If it is just to keep her (torn) clothes on, a ribbon suffices;</p>
<p class="bas indent2"><span class="nm">2.</span>If it is to disgrace her corresponding to the way she sinned, it is Me'akev;</p>
<p class="bas indent3"><span class="nm">i.</span>We learned that she girded herself with a fancy ribbon (to appeal to the Bo'el (adulterer)), therefore a Mitzri rope is tied above her breasts.</p>
<p class="bas indent1"><span class="nm">(h)</span><span class="cl">Answer (Rav Huna - Beraisa):</span> A Mitzri rope is brought to keep her clothes from falling.</p>
<p class="bas indent1"><span class="nm">(i)</span><span class="cl">(Mishnah):</span> Anyone who wants to see her is permitted...</p>
<p class="bas indent1"><span class="nm">(j)</span><span class="cl">Contradiction:</span> All may see her connotes men and women. The Seifa says that all the women may see her. This implies that men may not!</p>
<p class="bas indent1"><span class="nm">(k)</span><span class="cl">Answer #1 (Abaye):</span> Also the Reisha means that any woman who wants to see her is allowed.</p>
<p class="bas indent1"><span class="nm">(l)</span><span class="cl">Objection (Rava):</span> The Mishnah says that anyone who wants to may see her!</p>
<p class="bas indent1"><span class="nm">(m)</span><span class="cl">Answer #2 (Rava):</span> Any man or woman who wants to see her is allowed;</p>
<p class="bas indent1"><span class="nm">(n)</span>All women (in the vicinity) are obligated to see her - "all the women will be chastised, and will not do like her harlotry."</p>
<p class="bas subject"><span class="nm">5)</span>MEASURE FOR MEASURE</p>
<p class="bas indent1"><span class="nm">(a)</span><span class="cl">(Mishnah):</span> Hash-m repays a person according to how he acted. She adorned herself to sin, so Hash-m makes her disgusting;</p>
<p class="bas indent2"><span class="nm">1.</span>She revealed herself to sin, so Hash-m reveals her;</p>
<p class="bas indent2"><span class="nm">2.</span>She first sinned with the thigh, then with her stomach. Her thigh is stricken first, and then her stomach, and the rest of the body is not spared.</p>
<p class="bas indent1"><span class="nm">(b)</span><span class="cl">(Gemara - Rav Yosef):</span> Even though the (four capital) punishments have ceased, people are still killed like they deserve.</p>
<p class="bas indent2"><span class="nm">1.</span><span class="cl">(Rav Yosef):</span> Even though the Sanhedrin ceased after the Churban, the four death penalties did not cease.</p>
<p class="bas indent2"><span class="nm">2.</span><span class="cl">Objection:</span> They did cease!</p>
<p class="bas indent2"><span class="nm">3.</span><span class="cl">Correction:</span> Rather, people still die like the four death penalties.</p>
<p class="bas indent3"><span class="nm">i.</span>One worthy of stoning falls from the roof, or a beast tramples him;</p>
<p class="bas indent3"><span class="nm">ii.</span>One worthy of burning falls in a fire, or is bitten by a (poisonous) snake (venom burns);</p>
<p class="bas indent3"><span class="nm">iii.</span>One worthy of death by the sword is executed by the government (guillotine), or bandits kill him;</p>
<p class="bas indent3"><span class="nm">iv.</span>One worthy of strangulation drowns in the river, or dies of croup.</p>
<p class="bas indent1"><span class="nm">(c)</span><span class="cl">(Beraisa - Rebbi):</span> Hash-m punishes Midah k'Neged Midah (according to the sin) - "b'Sase'ah (for each Se'ah (measure)) You send discipline."</p>
<p class="bas indent2"><span class="nm">1.</span><span class="cl">Question:</span> This only shows for a Se'ah (a large measure, i.e. a big sin). What is the source for smaller, even tiny measures?</p>
<p class="bas indent2"><span class="nm">2.</span><span class="cl">Answer:</span> We learn from "Ki Kol Se'on So'en b'Ra'ash."</p>
<p class="bas indent2"><span class="nm">3.</span><span class="cl">Question:</span> What is the source that every Perutah joins to make a big liability?</p>
<p class="bas indent2"><span class="nm">4.</span><span class="cl">Answer:</span> We learn from "one by one makes a (big) sum."</p>
<p class="bas indent1"><span class="nm">(d)</span>We find that a Sotah is punished Midah k'Neged Midah:</p>
<p class="bas indent2"><span class="nm">1.</span>She stood at the opening of her house to be seen by the Bo'el. Therefore the Kohen stands her at the Nikanor Gate, to show her disgrace to all;</p>
<p class="bas indent2"><span class="nm">2.</span>She put nice kerchiefs on her hair. Therefore, the Kohen removes her kerchief, and puts it under her feet;</p>
<p class="bas indent2"><span class="nm">3.</span>She prettied her face. Therefore, her face turns green.</p>
