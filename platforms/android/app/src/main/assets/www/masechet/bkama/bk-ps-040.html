<p class="bas subject"><span class="nm">1)</span>THE ARGUMENT OF R. YAKOV AND R. YEHUDAH</p>
<p class="bas indent1"><span class="nm">(a)</span><span class="cl">Question (R. Acha bar Abaye):</span> Granted, Abaye holds that R. Yakov and R. Yehudah argue (Beraisa #1 must discuss a Mu'ad, for R. Yakov holds that we do not appoint an Apotropos to collect from a Tam);</p>
<p class="bas indent2"><span class="nm">1.</span>But Rava holds that all agree (that we appoint an Apotropos to collect from a Tam). He should establish Beraisa #1 to discuss a Tam, not a Mu'ad!</p>
<p class="bas indent2"><span class="nm">2.</span>If R. Yakov holds like R. Yehudah (who says that minimal guarding does not suffice for a Tam (Mishnah, 45b), the case would be that) he guarded it minimally. If he holds like R. Eliezer ben Yakov (in the coming Beraisa), he did not guard it at all.</p>
<p class="bas indent3"><span class="nm">i.</span><span class="cl">(Beraisa - R. Eliezer ben Yakov):</span> A Tam or Mu'ad is exempt if it was guarded minimally.</p>
<p class="bas indent2"><span class="nm">3.</span><span class="cl">(Summation of question):</span> The Chidush would be that we appoint an Apotropos to collect from a Tam!</p>
<p class="bas indent1"><span class="nm">(b)</span><span class="cl">Answer (Ravina):</span> Rava established the Beraisa to discuss a Mu'ad, so it teaches that when an animal becomes Mu'ad, it retains liability for half-damage like a Tam.</p>
<p class="bas indent1"><span class="nm">(c)</span><span class="cl">Answer #2 ((to Question 3:h, 39b) - Ravina):</span> R. Yakov and R. Yehudah argue about whether or not a change in Reshus changes the status of the ox.</p>
<p class="bas indent2"><span class="nm">1.</span>The case is, a Cheresh, lunatic or child owned a Mu'ad ox. He became healthy or grew up.</p>
<p class="bas indent2"><span class="nm">2.</span>R. Yehudah says, the ox is still Mu'ad (a change in Reshus does not change its status);</p>
<p class="bas indent2"><span class="nm">3.</span>R. Yakov says, it is now Tam.</p>
<p class="bas subject"><span class="nm">2)</span>KOFER</p>
<p class="bas indent1"><span class="nm">(a)</span><span class="cl">(Beraisa):</span> An Apotropos pays from the Aliyah (not from the animal). He does not pay Kofer (ransom for a Mu'ad that killed a person).</p>
<p class="bas indent1"><span class="nm">(b)</span><span class="cl">Question:</span> Who is this Tana, who holds that Kofer is for atonement, and orphans do not need atonement?</p>
<p class="bas indent1"><span class="nm">(c)</span><span class="cl">Answer (Rav Chisda):</span> It is R. Yishmael (the son of R. Yochanan ben Berokah);</p>
<p class="bas indent2"><span class="nm">1.</span><span class="cl">(Beraisa):</span> "He (the owner of the ox that killed) will give the redemption of his soul" - the value of the victim;</p>
<p class="bas indent2"><span class="nm">2.</span>R. Yishmael says, he gives the value of the (owner of the) damager.</p>
<p class="bas indent2"><span class="nm">3.</span><span class="cl">Suggestion:</span> Chachamim hold that Kofer is a payment for damage; R. Yishmael holds that it is a Kaparah (atonement).</p>
<p class="bas indent2"><span class="nm">4.</span><span class="cl">Rejection (Rav Papa):</span> No, all hold it is a Kaparah. They argue about how we assess the payment.</p>
<p class="bas indent2"><span class="nm">5.</span><span class="cl">Question:</span> Why do Chachamim obligate the value of the victim?</p>
<p class="bas indent2"><span class="nm">6.</span><span class="cl">Answer:</span> The Torah writes Shisa (an assessment) regarding compensation for causing a fetus to die, and regarding Kofer. Just like regarding a fetus, we evaluate the victim's value, also regarding Kofer.</p>
<p class="bas indent2"><span class="nm">7.</span>R. Yishmael learns from "he will give the redemption of his soul" (the damager needs to redeem his soul).</p>
<p class="bas indent2"><span class="nm">8.</span>Chachamim agree (that the damager needs to redeem his soul), but the payment is like the value of the victim.</p>
<p class="bas indent1"><span class="nm">(d)</span><span class="cl">Question (R. Acha bar Yakov #1):</span> How does the ox of two partners pay Kofer?</p>
<p class="bas indent2"><span class="nm">1.</span>Each cannot pay. The Torah said (one) Kofer, not two!</p>
<p class="bas indent2"><span class="nm">2.</span>Each cannot pay half. The Torah discusses (full) Kofer, not half-Kofer!</p>
<p class="bas indent1"><span class="nm">(e)</span><span class="cl">Question #2 (R. Acha bar Yakov - Mishnah):</span> The Gizbar (treasurer of Hekdesh) take securities from people who pledged Erchin (to give to Hekdesh an amount based on a person's age and gender), but not from people obligated to bring Korban Chatas or Olah.</p>
<p class="bas indent2"><span class="nm">1.</span>Does he take securities from people liable to pay Kofer?</p>
<p class="bas indent2"><span class="nm">2.</span>Since it is a Kaparah, people are concerned to bring it, it is like Chata'os and Olos, so he need not take securities;</p>
<p class="bas indent2"><span class="nm">3.</span>Or, since it is paid to a person, and not to Hekdesh, people take it lightly, so he takes securities!</p>
<p class="bas indent2"><span class="nm">4.</span>Alternatively, he himself did not damage, he takes it lightly, so we take a security from him!</p>
<p class="bas indent1"><span class="nm">(f)</span><span class="cl">Rav Nachman:</span> I am still struggling with the first question!</p>
<p class="bas subject"><span class="nm">3)</span>RESPONSIBILITY OF A BORROWER</p>
<p class="bas indent1"><span class="nm">(a)</span><span class="cl">(Beraisa):</span> If Reuven lent an ox to Shimon and told him that it is Tam, and it was found to be Mu'ad (and it damaged), each pays half-damage.</p>
<p class="bas indent2"><span class="nm">1.</span>If it was Tam and became Mu'ad while with Shimon and he returned it (and then it damaged), Reuven pays half-damage, and Shimon is exempt.</p>
<p class="bas indent1"><span class="nm">(b)</span><span class="cl">Question:</span> In the first case, why does Shimon pay half? He can say that he didn't know that it is a gorer!</p>
<p class="bas indent1"><span class="nm">(c)</span><span class="cl">Answer #1 (Rav):</span> The case is, he knew that it was a gorer (but not that it had gored three times).</p>
<p class="bas indent1"><span class="nm">(d)</span><span class="cl">Question:</span> Still, he can say that he intended to borrow only a Tam!</p>
<p class="bas indent1"><span class="nm">(e)</span><span class="cl">Answer:</span> In any case, he would be responsible for half- damage. That is all we ask him to pay!</p>
<p class="bas indent1"><span class="nm">(f)</span><span class="cl">Question:</span> Shimon can say, a Tam pays only from itself (not from my money)!</p>
<p class="bas indent1"><span class="nm">(g)</span><span class="cl">Answer:</span> In any case, if the animal was collected, Shimon could not return it and would need to compensate Reuven!</p>
<p class="bas bbbline">40b----------------------------------------40b</p>
<p class="bas indent1"><span class="nm">(h)</span><span class="cl">Objection:</span> Shimon can say, if it were Tam, I could have admitted to the damage, to be exempt!</p>
<p class="bas indent2"><span class="nm">1.</span>Even according to the opinion that half-damage is not a fine (and even one who admits pays), he could have hidden the animal from Beis Din, to evade payment! (Tosfos - i.e. therefore he could have persuaded the victim to agree to a small payment).</p>
<p class="bas indent1"><span class="nm">(i)</span><span class="cl">Answer #2:</span> Rather, the case is, Beis Din seized the animal.</p>
<p class="bas indent1"><span class="nm">(j)</span><span class="cl">Question:</span> If so, why does Reuven pay half? He can say, you put my animal in (allowed it to be taken to) a place from where I cannot retrieve it!</p>
<p class="bas indent1"><span class="nm">(k)</span><span class="cl">Answer:</span> Shimon can say, even had I returned it to you, Beis Din would have taken it.</p>
<p class="bas indent1"><span class="nm">(l)</span><span class="cl">Question:</span> Reuven can say 'I could have hidden the animal!'</p>
<p class="bas indent1"><span class="nm">(m)</span><span class="cl">Answer #1:</span> That doesn't help for a Mu'ad.</p>
<p class="bas indent1"><span class="nm">(n)</span><span class="cl">Question:</span> That answer is only if Reuven has other property that Beis Din can collect from. If Reuven has no other property, what can we say?</p>
<p class="bas indent1"><span class="nm">(o)</span><span class="cl">Answer #2:</span> Shimon can say, just like I owe you (the return of your animal), I owe the victim (since you owe him), due to R. Nasan's law (so you cannot blame me for letting Beis Din take it);</p>
<p class="bas indent2"><span class="nm">1.</span><span class="cl">(R. Nasan):</span> "He will give to the one he sinned against" teaches that if Levi owes David and David owes Moshe, we take from Levi to pay Moshe.</p>
<p class="bas subject"><span class="nm">4)</span>A CHANGE IN <i>RESHUS</i></p>
<p class="bas indent1"><span class="nm">(a)</span><span class="cl">(Beraisa):</span> If it was Tam and became Mu'ad while with Shimon and he returned it (and then it damaged), Reuven pays half-damage, and Shimon is exempt.</p>
<p class="bas indent1"><span class="nm">(b)</span><span class="cl">Question:</span> The Seifa holds that a change in Reshus changes status of the ox, and the Reisha says that it does not!</p>
<p class="bas indent1"><span class="nm">(c)</span><span class="cl">Answer #1 (R. Yochanan):</span> Different Tana'im taught the two clauses.</p>
<p class="bas indent1"><span class="nm">(d)</span><span class="cl">Answer #2 (Rabah):</span> It is all like one Tana. The Reisha teaches that a change in Reshus does not change status of the ox;</p>
<p class="bas indent2"><span class="nm">1.</span>The reason for the Seifa is that Shimon's negligence cannot cause Reuven's ox to be considered Mu'ad by Reuven.</p>
<p class="bas indent1"><span class="nm">(e)</span><span class="cl">Answer #3 (Rav Papa):</span> It is all like one Tana. The Seifa teaches that a change in Reshus changes status of the ox;</p>
<p class="bas indent2"><span class="nm">1.</span>The reason for the Reisha is that it is always considered Reuven's ox (giving it to someone else who will guard it is not a change in Reshus).</p>
<p class="bas subject"><span class="nm">5)</span>AN OX TRAINED TO GORE</p>
<p class="bas indent1"><span class="nm">(a)</span><span class="cl">(Mishnah):</span> An Itztadin (stadium) ox is not killed...</p>
<p class="bas indent1"><span class="nm">(b)</span><span class="cl">Question:</span> May it be offered for a Korban?</p>
<p class="bas indent1"><span class="nm">(c)</span><span class="cl">Answer #1 (Rav):</span> Yes, for it was forced (to gore).</p>
<p class="bas indent1"><span class="nm">(d)</span><span class="cl">Answer #2 (Shmuel):</span> No, for a sin was done with it.</p>
<p class="bas indent1"><span class="nm">(e)</span><span class="cl">Question (Beraisa):</span> "From the animals" excludes a Rove'a or Nirva (an animal that had Bi'ah with a woman or man; it may not be offered). "From the cattle" excludes an animal that was worshipped. "From the flock" excludes an animal designated for idolatry. "And from the flock" excludes a gorer (that killed).</p>
<p class="bas indent2"><span class="nm">1.</span><span class="cl">R. Shimon:</span> The Torah needs to exclude both a Rove'a and a gorer, for each has different laws.</p>
<p class="bas indent3"><span class="nm">i.</span>A Rove'a has the same law whether or not it was forced. This does not apply to a gorer.</p>
<p class="bas indent3"><span class="nm">ii.</span>A gorer pays Kofer, but a Rove'a does not.</p>
<p class="bas indent2"><span class="nm">2.</span><span class="cl">Suggestion:</span> R. Shimon said the law of Rove'a is the same whether or not it was forced, but this is not true about a gorer. This refers to (being disqualified for) a Korban.</p>
<p class="bas indent1"><span class="nm">(f)</span><span class="cl">Answer:</span> No, it refers to being killed.</p>
<p class="bas indent1"><span class="nm">(g)</span><span class="cl">Support:</span> Presumably, it does not refer to a Korban. The Torah did not explicitly say that it is disqualified only if it was not forced (and R. Shimon considers this distinction obvious).</p>
<p class="bas indent1"><span class="nm">(h)</span><span class="cl">(Beraisa):</span> A gorer pays Kofer, but a Rove'a does not.</p>
<p class="bas indent1"><span class="nm">(i)</span><span class="cl">Question:</span> What is the case (in which a Rove'a does not pay Kofer)?</p>
<p class="bas indent2"><span class="nm">1.</span>If it killed through Bi'ah, why is this be different than killing with its horns?</p>
<p class="bas indent2"><span class="nm">2.</span>If it had Bi'ah and did not kill, it is exempt from Kofer because it did not kill (this is not a stringency of a gorer)!</p>
<p class="bas indent1"><span class="nm">(j)</span><span class="cl">Answer #1 (Abaye):</span> Really, it had Bi'ah and did not kill. The woman (with whom it had Bi'ah) was killed by Beis Din.</p>
<p class="bas indent2"><span class="nm">1.</span>One might have thought that this is like killing her. The Beraisa teaches that this is not so.</p>
