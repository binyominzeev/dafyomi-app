<div class="subject"><span class="nm">1)</span><p>CONTRADICTION BETWEEN WITNESSES</p></div>
<div class="indent1"><span class="nm">(a)</span><p><span class="cl">Answer #1 (Rav Sheshes):</span> This shows that contradiction is the beginning of Hazamah (disqualifying witnesses through testimony of other witnesses that at the time the first witnesses say that they saw the testimony, they were elsewhere).</p></div>
<div class="indent2"><span class="nm">1.</span><p>Just like Hazamah is only in front of the witnesses, also contradiction must be in front of them.</p></div>
<div class="indent1"><span class="nm">(b)</span><p><span class="cl">Objection (Rav Nachman):</span> If David and Levi were here and contradicted these latter witnesses, we would have contradictory testimony, and one could not collect with this document.</p></div>
<div class="indent2"><span class="nm">1.</span><p>In our case David and Levi are not here, and if they would be here, perhaps they would admit. Do we rely on David and Levi (and allow one to use the document)?!</p></div>
<div class="indent1"><span class="nm">(c)</span><p><span class="cl">Answer #2 (Rav Nachman):</span> The latter two witnesses counter the former two, and we leave the money (or property) in its Chazakah with its current owner (the alleged borrower or seller).</p></div>
<div class="indent1"><span class="nm">(d)</span><p>This is like the property of Bar Shatya (a man who alternated between sanity and insanity).</p></div>
<div class="indent1"><span class="nm">(e)</span><p>Bar Shatya sold property. Two witnesses said that he was insane at the time (so the sale is invalid). Two others said that he was sane at the time.</p></div>
<div class="indent1"><span class="nm">(f)</span><p><span class="cl">(Rav Ashi):</span> Two witnesses counter the other two, and the property stays in the possession of Bar Shatya.</p></div>
<div class="indent1"><span class="nm">(g)</span><p>This applies only to property he inherited, but not if he himself bought property and now sold it. (There is no Chazakah that it is his.) Perhaps he was insane when he bought it!</p></div>
<div class="indent1"><span class="nm">(h)</span><p><span class="cl">(R. Avahu):</span> <i>Hazamah</i> of witnesses can only be in their presence. They can be <i>contradicted</i> in their absence.</p></div>
<div class="indent2"><span class="nm">1.</span><p>If Hazamah is done in their absence, it is not considered Hazamah, but it is contradiction.</p></div>
<div class="subject"><span class="nm">2)</span><p>VALIDATION OF DOCUMENTS</p></div>
<div class="indent1"><span class="nm">(a)</span><p><span class="cl">(Beraisa (19b)):</span> If (other) witnesses know that these are their signatures, or if there is another document which they signed which was contested and validated by Beis Din, they are not believed (to say that the witnesses on a document were invalid).</p></div>
<div class="indent1"><span class="nm">(b)</span><p><span class="cl">Inference:</span> Another document may be used to validate only if it was disputed. This supports R. Asi.</p></div>
<div class="indent2"><span class="nm">1.</span><p><span class="cl">(R. Asi):</span> We validate a document only from a document that was disputed and validated by Beis Din.</p></div>
<div class="indent1"><span class="nm">(c)</span><p><span class="cl">(Chachamim of Neharda'a):</span> We validate a document only from two Kesuvos or from two documents of sale of fields that the buyers used for three years without protest.</p></div>
<div class="indent1"><span class="nm">(d)</span><p><span class="cl">(R. Simi bar Asi):</span> This applies only if the documents are held by others, and not by the bearer of the document we wish to validate;</p></div>
<div class="indent2"><span class="nm">1.</span><p>The bearer may not validate it from documents he holds, lest he copied the signatures.</p></div>
<div class="indent1"><span class="nm">(e)</span><p><span class="cl">Question:</span> The same concern applies to documents held by others. Perhaps he saw them and imitated the signatures!</p></div>
<div class="indent1"><span class="nm">(f)</span><p><span class="cl">Answer:</span> We are concerned that he could imitate them so well only if he has the documents.</p></div>
<div class="subject"><span class="nm">3)</span><p>WRITTEN TESTIMONY</p></div>
<div class="indent1"><span class="nm">(a)</span><p><span class="cl">(Beraisa):</span> A person may write in a document testimony that he saw, and (orally) testify based on it many years later.</p></div>
<div class="indent1"><span class="nm">(b)</span><p><span class="cl">Opinion #1 (Rav Huna):</span> He can testify only if he remembers (some of) the testimony by himself.</p></div>
<div class="indent1"><span class="nm">(c)</span><p><span class="cl">Opinion #2 (R. Yochanan):</span> He can testify even if he does not remember it by himself.</p></div>
<div class="indent2"><span class="nm">1.</span><p><span class="cl">(Rabah):</span> We learn from R. Yochanan that if two witnesses saw testimony and one forgot it, the other may remind him.</p></div>
<div class="indent1"><span class="nm">(d)</span><p><span class="cl">Question:</span> May a party in the case remind a witness of the testimony?</p></div>
<div class="indent1"><span class="nm">(e)</span><p><span class="cl">Answer #1 (R. Chaviva):</span> Yes.</p></div>
<div class="indent1"><span class="nm">(f)</span><p><span class="cl">Answer #2 (Mar bar Rav Ashi):</span> No.</p></div>
<div class="indent1"><span class="nm">(g)</span><p>The Halachah is, he may not;</p></div>
<div class="bbbline">20b----------------------------------------20b</p></div>
<div class="indent2"><span class="nm">1.</span><p>If the witness is a Chacham, he may testify even if the claimant reminded him.</p></div>
<div class="indent1"><span class="nm">(h)</span><p>Rav Ashi knew testimony for Rav Kahana, but forgot it, even after Rav Kahana tried reminding him of it. Later, he remembered and testified for him.</p></div>
<div class="indent1"><span class="nm">(i)</span><p>Rav Kahana was taken aback that Rav Ashi was testifying for him.</p></div>
<div class="indent1"><span class="nm">(j)</span><p><span class="cl">Rav Ashi:</span> Don't worry, I'm not relying on what you said. I put my mind to it and remembered.</p></div>
<div class="subject"><span class="nm">4)</span><p>TUM'AH OF MOUNDS</p></div>
<div class="indent1"><span class="nm">(a)</span><p><span class="cl">(Mishnah):</span> Mounds that are close to the city or the road are Tamei, whether they are old or new;</p></div>
<div class="indent1"><span class="nm">(b)</span><p>Old far mounds are Tamei, and new ones are Tahor;</p></div>
<div class="indent1"><span class="nm">(c)</span><p><span class="cl">(R. Meir):</span> Within 50 Amos is considered close. Sixty years old is considered old;</p></div>
<div class="indent1"><span class="nm">(d)</span><p><span class="cl">(R. Yehudah):</span> If there is no closer one, it is called close. If no one remembers before it was built, it is old.</p></div>
<div class="indent1"><span class="nm">(e)</span><p><span class="cl">Question:</span> What do 'city' and 'road' refer to?</p></div>
<div class="indent2"><span class="nm">1.</span><p>It cannot refer to the simple meaning, for mi'Safek (without a source) we do not presume that there is Tum'ah!</p></div>
<div class="indent3"><span class="nm">i.</span><p><span class="cl">(Reish Lakish):</span> An excuse was found to be Metaher Eretz Yisrael.</p></div>
<div class="indent1"><span class="nm">(f)</span><p><span class="cl">Answer (R. Zeira):</span> Rather, 'city' is a city near a cemetery, and 'road' is a road to a cemetery.</p></div>
<div class="indent1"><span class="nm">(g)</span><p><span class="cl">Question:</span> We understand why the mound on the road is Tamei. Sometimes there is not enough time before Shabbos to get to the cemetery, and the body is buried in the mound;</p></div>
<div class="indent2"><span class="nm">1.</span><p>But if a city is near a cemetery, why is a nearby mound Tamei? Everyone would go to the cemetery!</p></div>
<div class="indent1"><span class="nm">(h)</span><p><span class="cl">Answer (R. Chanina):</span> Women bury miscarriages in mounds, and lepers bury limbs that fell off;</p></div>
<div class="indent2"><span class="nm">1.</span><p>Up to 50 Amos, a woman would go alone (and the Tum'ah would be unknown). More than 50 Amos, she would get an escort, and go to the cemetery. Therefore, in Eretz Yisrael we do not assume that they are Tamei.</p></div>
<div class="indent1"><span class="nm">(i)</span><p><span class="cl">(Rav Chisda):</span> We learn from R. Meir that a person remembers testimony for 60 years, but no longer.</p></div>
<div class="indent1"><span class="nm">(j)</span><p><span class="cl">Rejection:</span> This is not so. It is not incumbent on a person to remember Tum'ah in a mound. He has a responsibility to remember testimony, so he (puts it to heart and) remembers it longer.</p></div>
<div class="subject"><span class="nm">5)</span><p>VALIDATION OF A DOCUMENT</p></div>
<div class="indent1"><span class="nm">(a)</span><p><span class="cl">(Mishnah):</span> If both witnesses on a document say that they recognize both signatures, they are believed;</p></div>
<div class="indent1"><span class="nm">(b)</span><p>Rebbi says, if each recognizes only his own signature, we need another witness who recognizes both signatures;</p></div>
<div class="indent1"><span class="nm">(c)</span><p>Chachamim say, this is not needed. A person is believed to verify his signature.</p></div>
