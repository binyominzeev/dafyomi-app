<p class="dedicationbox">SHABBOS 91 - Two weeks of study material have been dedicated by Mrs. Estanne Abraham Fawer to honor the thirteenth Yahrzeit of her father, Rav Mordechai ben Eliezer Zvi (Rabbi Morton Weiner) Z'L, who passed away on 18 Teves 5760. May the merit of supporting and advancing Dafyomi study -- which was so important to him -- during the weeks of his Yahrzeit serve as an Iluy for his Neshamah. </p>

<p class="bas subject"><span class="nm">1)</span>LIABILITY FOR LESS THAN K'GROGERES</p>
<p class="bas indent1"><span class="nm">(a)</span><span class="cl">(Rav Yehudah):</span> R. Meir is Mechayev if one was Motzi even one wheat kernel for planting.</p>
<p class="bas indent1"><span class="nm">(b)</span><span class="cl">Objection:</span> This is obvious, the Mishnah says 'any amount'!</p>
<p class="bas indent1"><span class="nm">(c)</span><span class="cl">Answer:</span> One might have thought that it says this because he is liable for less than k'Grogeres, but it must be a k'Zayis - Rav Yehudah teaches, this is not so.</p>
<p class="bas indent1"><span class="nm">(d)</span><span class="cl">Question (Rav Yitzchak brei d'Rav Yehudah):</span> If everything depends on the intent of the Motzi, if one intended to Motzi his whole house [at once], is he exempt until he is Motzi it all [at once]?!</p>
<p class="bas indent1"><span class="nm">(e)</span><span class="cl">Answer:</span> There, we are not concerned for his intent, the Halachah is based on normal people. (Ritva - one can Machshiv (consider important) something others do not Machshiv, for really all Machshiv it, just others do not toil on account of it - but one cannot say that anything less than his whole house is unimportant, for others Machshiv it.)</p>
<p class="bas indent1"><span class="nm">(f)</span><span class="cl">(Mishnah):</span> Anyone else is not liable unless if he was Motzi a Shi'ur.</p>
<p class="bas indent1"><span class="nm">(g)</span>Our Mishnah is unlike R. Shimon ben Elazar:</p>
<p class="bas indent2"><span class="nm">1.</span><span class="cl">(Beraisa - R. Shimon ben Elazar):</span> The general rule is - if an item is not fitting to save, or if it is less than people save, and Reuven decided to save it, and Shimon was Motzi it, he is liable on account of Reuven's intent.</p>
<p class="bas indent1"><span class="nm">(h)</span><span class="cl">(Rava):</span> If one was Motzi k'Grogeres to eat it, and [before putting it down] decided to plant it, or vice-versa, he is liable.</p>
<p class="bas indent1"><span class="nm">(i)</span><span class="cl">Objection:</span> This is obvious - this is [at least] the Shi'ur for either of these!</p>
<p class="bas indent1"><span class="nm">(j)</span><span class="cl">Answer:</span> One might have thought that he is not liable unless the Akirah and Hanachah were with the same intent - Rava teaches, this is not so.</p>
<p class="bas indent1"><span class="nm">(k)</span><span class="cl">Question #1 (Rava):</span> If one was Motzi half a k'Grogeres to plant, and it inflated [to k'Grogeres], then he decided to eat it, what is the law?</p>
<p class="bas indent2"><span class="nm">1.</span>Perhaps above [when he reconsidered in the middle] he is liable because there is a Shi'ur for either intent - but here, he was not Motzi a Shi'ur for eating!</p>
<p class="bas indent2"><span class="nm">2.</span>Or, perhaps since he would have been Chayav for his original intent had he not reconsidered, he is liable even if he reconsidered!</p>
<p class="bas indent1"><span class="nm">(l)</span><span class="cl">Question #2 (Rava):</span> If you will say the latter way - what is the law if he was Motzi a k'Grogeres to eat, and it shriveled, then he decided to plant it?</p>
<p class="bas indent2"><span class="nm">1.</span>Had he not reconsidered, he would have been exempt - therefore, even though he reconsidered, he is exempt;</p>
<p class="bas indent2"><span class="nm">2.</span>Or, perhaps we follow his intent now [at the time of Hanachah], he is liable!</p>
<p class="bas indent1"><span class="nm">(m)</span><span class="cl">Question #3 (Rava):</span> If you will say that we follow his intent now, what is the law if he was Motzi a k'Grogeres to eat, and it shriveled, then it inflated again to k'Grogeres?</p>
<p class="bas indent2"><span class="nm">1.</span>Regarding Shabbos, do we apply to the principle of Dichuy (if something became disqualified, it will never become qualified again - do we say, since when it shriveled he could not have been liable for Hanachah, he cannot be liable [for this Hotza'ah] even if it inflated again)?</p>
<p class="bas indent1"><span class="nm">(n)</span>These questions are not resolved (Rambam - each of the first two questions is resolved like the presumption of the following question).</p>
<p class="bas subject"><span class="nm">2)</span>RECEIVING AND LOSING IMPORTANCE</p>
<p class="bas indent1"><span class="nm">(a)</span><span class="cl">Question (Rava):</span> If one threw a k'Zayis of Terumah into a Tamei house, what is the law?</p>
<p class="bas indent2"><span class="nm">1.</span><span class="cl">Question:</span> What does he ask about?</p>
<p class="bas indent3"><span class="nm">i.</span>He does not ask about Shabbos, its Shi'ur is k'Grogeres!</p>
<p class="bas indent3"><span class="nm">ii.</span>He does not ask about Kabalas Tum'ah, its Shi'ur [for food] is k'Beitzah!</p>
<p class="bas indent2"><span class="nm">2.</span><span class="cl">Answer:</span> Really, he asks about Shabbos - the case is, less than k'Beitzah was in the house, the k'Zayis landed on it and completed the Shi'ur of k'Beitzah;</p>
<p class="bas indent3"><span class="nm">i.</span>Since it completes the Shi'ur for Tum'ah [it has importance like k'Grogeres], so he is liable for Hotza'ah;</p>
<p class="bas indent3"><span class="nm">ii.</span>Or, perhaps a proper k'Grogeres is required?</p>
<p class="bas indent1"><span class="nm">(b)</span><span class="cl">Answer (Rav Nachman - Beraisa - Aba Sha'ul):</span> The Shi'ur [regarding Hotza'ah] for Shtei ha'Lechem and Lechem ha'Panim is k'Grogeres;</p>
<p class="bas indent2"><span class="nm">1.</span>We do not say that since the Shi'ur for [lashes for eating] Yotzei (if either leaves the Azarah it becomes Pasul) is k'Zayis, also the Shi'ur for Shabbos is k'Zayis!</p>
<p class="bas bbbline">91b----------------------------------------91b</p>
<p class="bas indent1"><span class="nm">(c)</span><span class="cl">Rejection:</span> There, it is Pasul once it left the Azarah, one is not liable regarding Shabbos until it enters Reshus ha'Rabim (therefore, a Shi'ur for Yotzei does not make one liable for Hotza'ah) - but here, the Hotza'ah and the Tum'ah occur at the same time (when it lands)!</p>
<p class="bas indent1"><span class="nm">(d)</span><span class="cl">(Mishnah):</span> If he later decided not to plant it and took it back into his house, he is liable only for a Shi'ur.</p>
<p class="bas indent1"><span class="nm">(e)</span><span class="cl">Objection:</span> This is obvious (he no longer considers it important, he is like anyone else)!</p>
<p class="bas indent1"><span class="nm">(f)</span><span class="cl">Answer (Abaye):</span> The case is, he threw it into a storehouse, it is recognizable (it did not get mixed everything else there):</p>
<p class="bas indent2"><span class="nm">1.</span>One might have thought, since it is recognizable, it is as if he stored it by itself - the Mishnah teaches, this is not so, he nullified his original intent.</p>
<p class="bas subject"><span class="nm">3)</span>PARTIAL HOTZA'AH</p>
<p class="bas indent1"><span class="nm">(a)</span><span class="cl">(Mishnah):</span> If one was Motzi food and put it on a ledge (this will be explained), he or anyone else who later was Motzi it is exempt, for the Melachah was not done at once.</p>
<p class="bas indent1"><span class="nm">(b)</span>If one put a basket full of produce on an outer ledge, even if most of the produce is outside, he is exempt unless he was Motzi the entire basket.</p>
<p class="bas indent1"><span class="nm">(c)</span><span class="cl">(Gemara) Question:</span> What kind of ledge is discussed?</p>
<p class="bas indent2"><span class="nm">1.</span>If it is Reshus ha'Rabim (it is nine Tefachim, people unload on it), he should be liable for putting it there;</p>
<p class="bas indent1"><span class="nm">(d)</span><span class="cl">Answer #1:</span> It is Reshus ha'Yachid (it is 10 Tefachim tall and four by four wide).</p>
<p class="bas indent1"><span class="nm">(e)</span><span class="cl">Objection:</span> The Mishnah exempts he or anyone else who later was Motzi it to Reshus ha'Rabim!</p>
<p class="bas indent1"><span class="nm">(f)</span><span class="cl">Answer #2:</span> It is Karmelis (it is between three and nine Tefachim);</p>
<p class="bas indent2"><span class="nm">1.</span>The Mishnah teaches that he is exempt only because it rested in the middle - otherwise, he is liable - it is unlike Ben Azai.</p>
<p class="bas indent2"><span class="nm">2.</span><span class="cl">(Beraisa):</span> If one was Motzi from a store (Reshus ha'Yachid) to the market (a Reshus ha'Rabim) via a Stav (a Karmelis), he is liable;</p>
<p class="bas indent2"><span class="nm">3.</span>Ben Azai exempts.</p>
<p class="bas indent1"><span class="nm">(g)</span><span class="cl">(Mishnah):</span> If one put a basket full of produce...</p>
<p class="bas indent1"><span class="nm">(h)</span><span class="cl">(Chizkiyah):</span> This applies only to a basket full of cucumbers and gourds (they are long, part of each is still in Reshus ha'Yachid) - but if it is full of mustard [seeds], he is liable (some of them are totally outside).</p>
<p class="bas indent1"><span class="nm">(i)</span><span class="cl">Inference:</span> He holds that Eged Kli Lo Shmei Eged (if an object in one Reshus is in a Kli which is partially in a different Reshus, we do not consider the object to be partially in the Reshus of the Kli).</p>
<p class="bas indent1"><span class="nm">(j)</span><span class="cl">(R. Yochanan):</span> The Mishnah applies even to a basket full of mustard.</p>
<p class="bas indent1"><span class="nm">(k)</span><span class="cl">Inference:</span> He holds that Eged Kli Shmei Eged (it is as if the object is partially in the Reshus of the Kli).</p>
<p class="bas indent1"><span class="nm">(l)</span><span class="cl">(R. Zeira):</span> The text of the Mishnah suggests unlike either of them!</p>
<p class="bas indent2"><span class="nm">1.</span>It says 'He is exempt unless he was Motzi the entire basket' - this implies that even if he was Motzi all the produce, he is exempt [if part of the basket is inside], i.e. Eged Kli Shmei Eged, unlike Chizkiyah!</p>
<p class="bas indent2"><span class="nm">2.</span>It says 'Even if most of the produce is outside' - this implies that if all the produce was outside, he would be liable, even if part of the basket is inside, i.e. Eged Kli Lo Shmei Eged, unlike R. Yochanan!</p>
<p class="bas indent1"><span class="nm">(m)</span><span class="cl">Question:</span> How will Chizkiyah and R. Yochanan answer these questions?</p>
<p class="bas indent1"><span class="nm">(n)</span><span class="cl">Answer - part 1:</span> Chizkiyah explains, 'Unless he was Motzi the entire basket' refers to a basket full of cucumbers and gourds - but if it is full of mustard, it is as if he was Motzi the entire basket, he is liable.</p>
<p class="bas indent1"><span class="nm">(o)</span><span class="cl">Answer - part 2:</span> R. Yochanan explains, 'Even if most of the produce is outside' - not only most, rather, even if all is outside, he is exempt, unless he was Motzi the entire basket.</p>
<p class="bas indent1"><span class="nm">(p)</span><span class="cl">Question (against Chizkiyah - Beraisa):</span> If one was Motzi a peddler's box and put it on an outer ledge, even if most of the varieties are outside, he is exempt unless he was Motzi the entire box.</p>
<p class="bas indent2"><span class="nm">1.</span><span class="cl">Suggestion:</span> The box contains small bundles of wrapped fragrances, most of the varieties are totally outside.</p>
<p class="bas indent1"><span class="nm">(q)</span><span class="cl">Rejection:</span> No, it contains long roots or cinnamon sticks, no variety is totally outside.</p>
