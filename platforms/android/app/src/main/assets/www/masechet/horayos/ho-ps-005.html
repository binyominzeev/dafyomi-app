<p class="bas subject"><span class="nm">1)</span>HOW MANY <i>PARIM</i> ARE BROUGHT?</p>
<p class="bas indent1"><span class="nm">(a)</span><span class="cl">(Mishnah - R. Meir):</span> If Beis Din ruled mistakenly and the majority of Yisrael sinned, Beis Din brings a Par. If they transgressed idolatry, they bring a Par and a Sa'ir;</p>
<p class="bas indent2"><span class="nm">1.</span>R. Yehudah says, they bring 12 Parim. For idolatry, they bring 12 Parim and 12 Se'irim;</p>
<p class="bas indent2"><span class="nm">2.</span>R. Shimon says, they bring 13 Parim, and for idolatry, 13 Parim and 13 Se'irim, one for each Shevet, and one for Beis Din.</p>
<p class="bas indent1"><span class="nm">(b)</span>R. Meir says, if Beis Din ruled and (the majority of each of) seven Shevatim sinned, Beis Din brings a Par. For idolatry, they bring a Par and a Sa'ir;</p>
<p class="bas indent2"><span class="nm">1.</span>R. Yehudah says, each Shevet that sinned brings a Par by itself. Also, every other Shevet brings a Par due to the Shevatim that sinned;</p>
<p class="bas indent2"><span class="nm">2.</span>R. Shimon says, eight Parim are brought (each Shevet that sinned brings one, and one for Beis Din); for idolatry, eight Parim and eight Se'irim are brought.</p>
<p class="bas indent1"><span class="nm">(c)</span>R. Yehudah says, if the Sanhedrin of a Shevet ruled and that Shevet sinned, that Shevet brings a Par. The other Shevatim are exempt;</p>
<p class="bas indent2"><span class="nm">1.</span>Chachamim say, Parim are brought only for rulings of the great Sanhedrin - "Im Kol Adas Yisrael Yishgu", and not the Sanhedrin of one Shevet.</p>
<p class="bas indent1"><span class="nm">(d)</span><span class="cl">(Gemara - Beraisa) Suggestion:</span> If Beis Din knows that they erred (and that most of Yisrael transgressed two sins, one due to Beis Din, and one b'Shogeg), but they do not remember which of the two was due to the Hora'ah, perhaps they are liable!</p>
<p class="bas indent1"><span class="nm">(e)</span><span class="cl">Rejection:</span> "And <i>the</i> sin became known" (they must know what they permitted). It is not enough to know that the majority sinned.</p>
<p class="bas indent1"><span class="nm">(f)</span>R. Yehudah says "that they sinned" - if two Shevatim sinned, they bring two Parim. If three Shevatim sinned, they bring three Parim.</p>
<p class="bas indent2"><span class="nm">1.</span><span class="cl">Suggestion:</span> Perhaps this teaches that if two or three individuals sinned, they bring two or three Parim!</p>
<p class="bas indent2"><span class="nm">2.</span><span class="cl">Rejection:</span> "Ha'Kahal" - the Kahal (all of Yisrael) is liable, and each Kahal (Shevet) is liable.</p>
<p class="bas indent3"><span class="nm">i.</span>If two Shevatim sinned, they bring two Parim. If seven Shevatim sinned, each brings a Par, and every other Shevet also brings a Par;</p>
<p class="bas indent3"><span class="nm">ii.</span>"Ha'Kahal... ha'Kahal" teaches that each Shevet brings.</p>
<p class="bas indent1"><span class="nm">(g)</span>R. Shimon says, the seven Shevatim that sinned bring seven Parim, and Beis Din brings one Par.</p>
<p class="bas indent2"><span class="nm">1.</span>We learn a Gezerah Shavah "Edah-Edah" from the sin. Just like the sin involved Beis Din and the Tzibur, also the Korbanos.</p>
<p class="bas indent1"><span class="nm">(h)</span>R. Meir says, Beis Din brings one Par for the seven Shevatim that sinned, and the Shevatim are exempt.</p>
<p class="bas indent2"><span class="nm">1.</span>We learn a Gezerah Shavah "Edah-Edah" from the Hora'ah. Just like the Hora'ah was through Beis Din alone, also the Korban.</p>
<p class="bas indent1"><span class="nm">(i)</span>R. Shimon ben Elazar cites R. Meir to say that if six Shevatim sinned comprising the majority of Yisrael, or seven Shevatim even if this is the minority, Beis Din brings a Par.</p>
<p class="bas indent1"><span class="nm">(j)</span><span class="cl">Question:</span> The Beraisa says '"and <i>the</i> sin became known", and not just that they know that the majority sinned.' Like whom is this?</p>
<p class="bas indent1"><span class="nm">(k)</span><span class="cl">Answer #1 (Rav Yehudah):</span> It is unlike R. Eliezer;</p>
<p class="bas indent2"><span class="nm">1.</span><span class="cl">(Mishnah - R. Eliezer):</span> If one is unsure whether he ate Chelev or Nosar (a Korban after the permitted time to eat it,) no matter which he ate, he must bring a Chatas!</p>
<p class="bas indent1"><span class="nm">(l)</span><span class="cl">Answer #2 (Rav Ashi):</span> It can even be like R. Eliezer. It says (regarding Hora'ah) "that they sinned <i>in it</i>" (Beis Din must know the mistake).</p>
<p class="bas indent2"><span class="nm">1.</span><span class="cl">Question:</span> Also regarding a Chatas, it says "that he sinned <i>in it</i>"!</p>
<p class="bas indent2"><span class="nm">2.</span><span class="cl">Answer:</span> That exempts Mis'asek (one who was engaged in something else, and sinned. He is exempt if he did not benefit.)</p>
<p class="bas indent1"><span class="nm">(m)</span><span class="cl">Question:</span> What is R. Yehudah's reason (to obligate even the Shevatim that did not sin)?</p>
<p class="bas indent1"><span class="nm">(n)</span><span class="cl">Answer:</span> He expounds the following four laws from "ha'Kahal... ha'Kahal" (the two words, and the two letters 'Hei'):</p>
<p class="bas indent2"><span class="nm">1.</span>Each Shevet is liable;</p>
<p class="bas indent2"><span class="nm">2.</span>(Parim are brought only when) Beis Din give a Hora'ah, and the people transgressed;</p>
<p class="bas indent2"><span class="nm">3.</span>Shevatim that didn't sin bring due to those that sinned;</p>
<p class="bas indent2"><span class="nm">4.</span>A Shevet that sinned due to following its Beis Din is liable.</p>
<p class="bas indent1"><span class="nm">(o)</span>R. Shimon does not expound one of the letters 'Hei' (the Torah merely speaks as people do). He expounds two words and one 'Hei';</p>
<p class="bas indent2"><span class="nm">1.</span>One teaches that each Shevet is liable. The other two are used for the Gezerah Shavah (just like both Beis Din and the Tzibur were involved in the sin, they both bring Korbanos).</p>
<p class="bas indent1"><span class="nm">(p)</span>R. Meir does not expound either 'Hei'. He learns only a Gezerah Shavah. Just like the Hora'ah was through Beis Din alone, also the Korban.</p>
<p class="bas indent1"><span class="nm">(q)</span><span class="cl">Question:</span> What is R. Shimon ben Elazar's reason?</p>
<p class="bas indent1"><span class="nm">(r)</span><span class="cl">Answer:</span> "Im <i>me'Einei</i> ha'Edah" implies, even from the minority;</p>
<p class="bas indent2"><span class="nm">1.</span><span class="cl">Contradiction:</span> "<i>All</i> the nation forgot" implies the majority!</p>
<p class="bas indent2"><span class="nm">2.</span><span class="cl">Resolution:</span> If six Shevatim sin, if they are the majority of Yisrael, Beis Din brings a Par. If seven Shevatim sin, even if they are the minority, a Par is brought.</p>

<p class="bas subject"><span class="nm">2)</span>HOW THE OTHER TANA'IM LEARN</p>
<p class="bas indent1"><span class="nm">(a)</span><span class="cl">Question:</span> How do R. Shimon and R. Meir learn that (Parim are brought only when) the Hora'ah comes from Beis Din, and the people transgress?</p>
<p class="bas indent1"><span class="nm">(b)</span><span class="cl">Answer #1 (Abaye):</span> They learn from "Im me'Einei ha'Edah Ne'es'sah li'Shgagah."</p>
<p class="bas indent1"><span class="nm">(c)</span><span class="cl">Answer #2 (Rava):</span> They learn from "the whole nation bi'Shgagah."</p>
<p class="bas indent1"><span class="nm">(d)</span>We need both verses.</p>
<p class="bas indent2"><span class="nm">1.</span>If we only had the first verse, one might have thought that a Par is brought even if the minority sinned;</p>
<p class="bas indent2"><span class="nm">2.</span>If we only had the second verse, one might have thought that a Par is brought only if Beis Din also sinned.</p>
<p class="bas indent1"><span class="nm">(e)</span><span class="cl">Question:</span> These verses are written regarding idolatry!</p>
<p class="bas indent1"><span class="nm">(f)</span><span class="cl">Answer:</span> We learn a Gezerah Shavah "me'Einei-me'Einei" from idolatry to other transgressions.</p>

<p class="bas indent1"><span class="nm">(a)</span><span class="cl">(Mishnah):</span> If the Beis Din of a Shevet ruled...</p>
<p class="bas indent1"><span class="nm">(b)</span><span class="cl">Question:</span> According to R. Yehudah, if one Shevet sinned through following the great Sanhedrin, do the other Shevatim also bring Parim?</p>
<p class="bas indent2"><span class="nm">1.</span>Only when seven Shevatim sin, then the others bring, for the majority sinned;</p>
<p class="bas indent2"><span class="nm">2.</span>Or, perhaps the others bring in any case!</p>
<p class="bas indent1"><span class="nm">(c)</span><span class="cl">Answer #1 (Beraisa):</span> They bring one Par;</p>
<p class="bas indent2"><span class="nm">1.</span>R. Shimon says, they bring two Parim.</p>

<p class="bas indent1"><span class="nm">(d)</span><span class="cl">Rejection:</span> No. The case is, six Shevatim sinned, comprising the majority of Yisrael. The first Tana is R. Shimon ben Elazar.</p>
<p class="bas indent2"><span class="nm">1.</span><span class="cl">(Beraisa - R. Shimon ben Elazar, citing R. Meir):</span> If six Shevatim sinned comprising the majority of Yisrael, or seven Shevatim even if this is the minority, Beis Din brings a Par.</p>
<p class="bas indent1"><span class="nm">(e)</span><span class="cl">Answer #2 (Beraisa - R. Yehudah):</span> If a Shevet sinned by following a Hora'ah of its own Beis Din, only that Shevet brings. If it sinned by following the great Sanhedrin, the other Shevatim also bring.</p>
<p class="bas indent1"><span class="nm">(f)</span><span class="cl">(Rav Ashi):</span> We may also derive this from our Mishnah!</p>
<p class="bas indent2"><span class="nm">1.</span><span class="cl">(Mishnah):</span> If a Shevet sinned by following its Beis Din, that Shevet brings, and the other Shevatim are exempt.</p>

<p class="bas indent2"><span class="nm">7.</span><span class="cl">Answer:</span> It is R. Shimon ben Elazar, like the above Beraisa.</p>

<p class="bas indent2"><span class="nm">2.</span><span class="cl">Answer (R. Yochanan):</span> They made a new decree, that a Tvul Yom (one who immersed from Tum'ah today. He is not fully Tahor until evening) may not enter Machaneh Levi.</p>
<p class="bas indent1"><span class="nm">(f)</span><span class="cl">Objection (Rav Acha bar Yakov):</span> Perhaps one Shevet alone is not called a Kahal. Part of Yerushalayim belongs to Shevet Binyamin!</p>

<p class="bas indent2"><span class="nm">1.</span>Binyamin was the only Shevet born after this. This shows that one Shevet is called a Kahal!</p>
<p class="bas indent1"><span class="nm">(h)</span><span class="cl">Question (Rav Sheva):</span> Perhaps (the family of) Yakov will first become a Kahal when Binyamin is born!</p>
<p class="bas indent1"><span class="nm">(i)</span><span class="cl">Answer (Rav Kahana):</span> If so, even 11 Shevatim would not be considered a Kahal! (However, "the Kahal of Yehudah" teaches that even two Shevatim are called a Kahal.)</p>
