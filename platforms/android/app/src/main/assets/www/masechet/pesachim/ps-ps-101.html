<div class="subject"><span class="nm">1)</span><p>WHO IS YOTZEI THROUGH KIDUSH IN SYNAGOGUE?</p></div>
<div class="indent1"><span class="nm">(a)</span><p><span class="cl">(Rav):</span> People who 'make' Kidush (listen to the Shali'ach Tzibur and have intent to be Yotzei) in synagogue are Yotzei Kidush [even if they did not taste the wine], but they are not Yotzei [the Berachah on] wine (even if they drank wine, once they leave the synagogue to go home they lose the Berachah, and must bless Borei Peri ha'Gafen on wine they will drink at home);</p></div>
<div class="indent1"><span class="nm">(b)</span><p><span class="cl">(Shmuel):</span> They are not even Yotzei Kidush.</p></div>
<div class="indent1"><span class="nm">(c)</span><p><span class="cl">Question:</span> According to Rav, why do they make Kidush at home?</p></div>
<div class="indent1"><span class="nm">(d)</span><p><span class="cl">Answer:</span> This is for the sake of their households [which were not in synagogue].</p></div>
<div class="indent1"><span class="nm">(e)</span><p><span class="cl">Question:</span> According to Shmuel, why do we make Kidush in synagogue?</p></div>
<div class="indent1"><span class="nm">(f)</span><p><span class="cl">Answer:</span> Visitors who eat, drink and sleep in the synagogue are Yotzei through it.</p></div>
<div class="indent1"><span class="nm">(g)</span><p>This is like Shmuel taught elsewhere, that Kidush must be in the place where one eats (therefore, only the visitors who eat in synagogue are Yotzei).</p></div>
<div class="indent1"><span class="nm">(h)</span><p><span class="cl">Assumption:</span> He disallows Kidush in one house and the meal in another house - but within one house, they need not be in the same place.</p></div>
<div class="indent1"><span class="nm">(i)</span><p><span class="cl">Rejection (Rav Anan bar Tachlifa):</span> Often I saw Shmuel descend from the roof to the ground floor [and make Kidush again, when his Ner extinguished before he ate - Tosfos Rid; Tzelach - even though Kidush with intent to eat elsewhere in the house works, e.g. for visitors in synagogue, this is only b'Di'eved - therefore, he would descend before making Kidush, and not rely on intent to eat below].</p></div>
<div class="indent1"><span class="nm">(j)</span><p>Also Rav Huna holds that Kidush must be in the place where one eats:</p></div>
<div class="indent2"><span class="nm">1.</span><p>Once, Rav Huna made Kidush and his lamp fell and extinguished [before he ate] - he brought his Kelim to the house where they were celebrating the wedding of his son, where there was light; he made Kidush and ate a bit there.</p></div>
<div class="indent2"><span class="nm">2.</span><p>This shows that he requires Kidush to be where one eats.</p></div>
<div class="indent1"><span class="nm">(k)</span><p>Also Rabah holds that Kidush must be in the place where one eats:</p></div>
<div class="indent2"><span class="nm">1.</span><p><span class="cl">Abaye:</span> In Rabah's house, when he was Mekadesh he told us to taste a bit, lest the lamp go out where we were lodging [and we will not eat there], and we are not Yotzei with his Kidush [without eating], for Kidush must be in the place where one eats.</p></div>
<div class="indent1"><span class="nm">(l)</span><p><span class="cl">Question:</span> Abaye taught that wherever Rav and Shmuel argue, Rabah always followed Rav, except for three Halachos in which he followed Shmuel:</p></div>
<div class="indent2"><span class="nm">1.</span><p>One may remove Tzitzis from a garment to attach them to another garment, one may light a Ner Chanukah from another Ner Chanukah, and the Halachah follows R. Shimon regarding dragging:</p></div>
<div class="indent3"><span class="nm">i.</span><p><span class="cl">(Beraisa - R. Shimon):</span> One may drag a bed, chair or bench [on a dirt floor], as long as he does not intend to make a furrow.</p></div>
<div class="indent1"><span class="nm">(m)</span><p><span class="cl">Answer:</span> Rabah followed the stringencies of Rav [with only three exceptions], but there are many leniencies of Rav he did not follow.</p></div>
<div class="subject"><span class="nm">2)</span><p>WHICH CHANGES MANDATE A NEW BLESSING?</p></div>
<div class="indent1"><span class="nm">(a)</span><p><span class="cl">(R. Yochanan):</span> People who make Kidush in synagogue are Yotzei [Kidush and] even [the blessing on] wine.</p></div>
<div class="indent1"><span class="nm">(b)</span><p>This is like he taught elsewhere:</p></div>
<div class="indent2"><span class="nm">1.</span><p><span class="cl">(R. Yochanan):</span> The same law applies to a change of wine or place - one need not make a new blessing. (One does not say Borei Peri ha'Gafen again, but he says ha'Tov veha'Metiv if the new wine is better (Rashbam; Tosfos - or slightly worse).)</p></div>
<div class="bbbline">101b----------------------------------------101b</p></div>
<div class="indent1"><span class="nm">(c)</span><p><span class="cl">Question (Beraisa):</span> A change of place mandates a new blessing; a change of wine does not.</p></div>
<div class="indent1"><span class="nm">(d)</span><p>R. Yochanan is refuted.</p></div>
<div class="indent1"><span class="nm">(e)</span><p><span class="cl">(Rav Chisda citing Rav Huna):</span> A change of place from one house to another mandates a new blessing - but within one house it does not.</p></div>
<div class="indent1"><span class="nm">(f)</span><p><span class="cl">Support (Rav Idi bar Avin):</span> A Beraisa was taught in the house of [or by] Rav Hinak like this!</p></div>
<div class="indent1"><span class="nm">(g)</span><p><span class="cl">Question:</span> Does Rav Huna teach [in his own name] the same Chidush as a Beraisa?</p></div>
<div class="indent1"><span class="nm">(h)</span><p><span class="cl">Answer:</span> [Yes -] he had not heard the Beraisa.</p></div>
<div class="indent1"><span class="nm">(i)</span><p><span class="cl">(Rav Chisda):</span> A change of place mandates a new blessing only regarding foods that do not require a Berachah [after eating them] in their place (where they were eaten, e.g. bread; some include the five grains or all seven species of Eretz Yisrael);</p></div>
<div class="indent2"><span class="nm">1.</span><p>No new blessing is required for foods that require a Berachah in their place.</p></div>
<div class="indent1"><span class="nm">(j)</span><p><span class="cl">Question:</span> What is the reason?</p></div>
<div class="indent1"><span class="nm">(k)</span><p><span class="cl">Answer:</span> Since he must return [to where he ate], it is considered a continuation of his meal.</p></div>
<div class="indent1"><span class="nm">(l)</span><p><span class="cl">(Rav Sheshes):</span> A new blessing is required in either case.</p></div>
<div class="indent1"><span class="nm">(m)</span><p><span class="cl">Question (against Rav Chisda - Beraisa):</span> If friends were reclining to drink and uprooted themselves to greet a groom or bride, they need not bless before leaving or when returning;</p></div>
<div class="indent2"><span class="nm">1.</span><p>This is when an old or sick person remained there - if not, they require a Berachah Acharonah on what they ate, and a new Berachah Rishonah when they return.</p></div>
<div class="indent2"><span class="nm">2.</span><p>'Uprooted' connotes that [normally, they would not leave suddenly without blessing, i.e.] they were eating foods that require a Berachah in their place - nevertheless, they must bless before leaving and when returning unless one of them remained!</p></div>
