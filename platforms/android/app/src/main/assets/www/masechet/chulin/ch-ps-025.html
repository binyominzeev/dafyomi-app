<div class="indent1"><span class="nm">(a)</span><p><span class="cl">Question (Rav Ada bar Ahavah):</span> A Kal va'Chomer should teach that a Kli Cheres becomes Tamei if Tum'ah touches its back!</p></div>
<div class="indent2"><span class="nm">1.</span><p>Any other Kli does not become Tamei through its interior, but becomes Tamei if Tum'ah touches its back. A Kli Cheres becomes Tamei through its interior, all the more so it should become Tamei through its exterior!</p></div>
<div class="indent1"><span class="nm">(b)</span><p><span class="cl">Answer (Rava):</span> "Any open Kli without a Tzamid Pasil (flush seal) on it" refers to Klei Cheres, which become Tamei as soon as Tum'ah enters their opening.</p></div>
<div class="indent2"><span class="nm">1.</span><p>If it has no Tzamid Pasil, it becomes Tamei (in a tent with a Mes). If it has a Tzamid Pasil, it remains Tahor (it does not receive Tum'ah from its exterior).</p></div>
<div class="indent1"><span class="nm">(c)</span><p><span class="cl">Suggestion:</span> A Kal va'Chomer should teach that any other Kli becomes Tamei if Tum'ah enters its interior!</p></div>
<div class="indent2"><span class="nm">1.</span><p>A Kli Cheres does not become Tamei through its back, but it becomes Tamei if Tum'ah enters its interior. Any other Kli becomes Tamei through its back. All the more so it should become Tamei through its interior!</p></div>
<div class="indent1"><span class="nm">(d)</span><p><span class="cl">Rejection:</span> "Its inside" teaches that only Klei Cheres become Tamei from their interior.</p></div>
<div class="indent1"><span class="nm">(e)</span><p><span class="cl">Question:</span> We already expounded "its inside"!</p></div>
<div class="indent1"><span class="nm">(f)</span><p><span class="cl">Answer:</span> We learn four things from the words "its inside" (since this appears twice, and each time it could have said just "inside",</p></div>
<div class="indent2"><span class="nm">1.</span><p>One is needed for the simple meaning;</p></div>
<div class="indent2"><span class="nm">2.</span><p>One is for the Gezeirah Shavah, which teaches that Tum'ah is Metamei the Kli even without touching it;</p></div>
<div class="indent2"><span class="nm">3.</span><p>One teaches that only Klei Cheres become Tamei in this way;</p></div>
<div class="indent2"><span class="nm">4.</span><p>One teaches that inside the inside (something in a Kli in the Kli Cheres), even if the inner Kli is not earthenware, is not considered like being inside the outer Kli.</p></div>
<div class="indent1"><span class="nm">(g)</span><p><span class="cl">Suggestion:</span> A Kal va'Chomer should teach that other Kelim do not become Tamei through their backs, rather, only if Tum'ah touches their interior!</p></div>
<div class="indent2"><span class="nm">1.</span><p>Klei Cheres become Tamei if Tum'ah enters their interior, but not from their backs. Other Kelim do not become Tamei through their interior. All the more so they should not become Tamei through their backs!</p></div>
<div class="indent1"><span class="nm">(h)</span><p><span class="cl">Rejection:</span> "Any open Kli without a flush seal" teaches that Klei Cheres without a Tzamid Pasil become Tamei (in a tent with a Mes). If they have a Tzamid Pasil, they remain Tahor;</p></div>
<div class="indent2"><span class="nm">1.</span><p>Other Kelim become Tamei (from their exterior) even if they have a Tzamid Pasil.</p></div>
<div class="subject"><span class="nm">2)</span><p>WOODEN AND METAL KELIM</p></div>
<div class="indent1"><span class="nm">(a)</span><p><span class="cl">(Mishnah):</span> The kinds of wooden Kelim that are Tehorim, such metal Kelim are (able to become) Teme'im. The kinds of metal Kelim that are Tehorim, such wooden Kelim are Teme'im.</p></div>
<div class="indent1"><span class="nm">(b)</span><p><span class="cl">(Gemara - Beraisa):</span> Unfinished wooden Kelim are Teme'im. Simple wooden Kelim (i.e. without an interior) are Tehorim. Unfinished metal Kelim are Tehorim. Simple metal Kelim are Teme'im;</p></div>
<div class="indent2"><span class="nm">1.</span><p>The kinds of wooden Kelim that are Tehorim, such metal Kelim are Teme'im. The kinds of metal Kelim that are Tehorim, such wooden Kelim are Teme'im.</p></div>
<div class="indent2"><span class="nm">2.</span><p>Unfinished wooden Kelim are those that must still be rubbed, smoothed, engraved, or adorned with small nails;</p></div>

<div class="indent3"><span class="nm">i.</span><p>If it is missing a base, rim or handle, it is Tamei. If it has not yet been carved out, it is Tahor.</p></div>
<div class="indent3"><span class="nm">ii.</span><p><span class="cl">Question:</span> Obviously, if it has not yet been carved out it is Tahor!</p></div>
<div class="indent3"><span class="nm">iii.</span><p><span class="cl">Answer:</span> The case is, it has been partially carved out. The owner intends to carve out more.</p></div>
<div class="indent2"><span class="nm">3.</span><p>Unfinished metal Kelim are those that must still be rubbed, smoothed, engraved, adorned with small nails;</p></div>
<div class="indent3"><span class="nm">i.</span><p>If it is missing a base, rim or handle, it is Tahor. If it is missing a cover, it is Tamei.</p></div>
<div class="indent1"><span class="nm">(c)</span><p><span class="cl">Question:</span> Why are the laws of unfinished wooden and metal Kelim different?</p></div>
<div class="indent1"><span class="nm">(d)</span><p><span class="cl">Answer #1 (R. Yochanan):</span> Metal Kelim are made to give status to their owners. (They do not fulfill their purpose until they enhance their owner's status.)</p></div>
<div class="indent1"><span class="nm">(e)</span><p><span class="cl">Answer #2 (Rav Nachman):</span> Metal Kelim are expensive. (They are made to be sold.)</p></div>
<div class="indent2"><span class="nm">1.</span><p>These answers differ about Kelim made of bone. They are expensive, but they are not made for honor.</p></div>
<div class="indent1"><span class="nm">(f)</span><p>Rav Nachman taught similarly elsewhere;</p></div>
<div class="indent2"><span class="nm">1.</span><p><span class="cl">(Rav Nachman):</span> Bone Kelim are like metal Kelim.</p></div>
<div class="indent2"><span class="nm">2.</span><p><span class="cl">Question:</span> This implies that bone Kelim can become Tamei. What is the source for this?</p></div>
<div class="indent2"><span class="nm">3.</span><p><span class="cl">Answer (Beraisa - R. Yishmael, son of R. Yochanan ben Brokah):</span> "You will sprinkle (water with ashes of the Parah Adumah, to be Metaher from Tum'as Mes) everything made from sheep" includes things made from the horns and hooves.</p></div>
<div class="indent3"><span class="nm">i.</span><p>We learn Kelim from bones of other animals from "everything made from sheep".</p></div>
<div class="indent3"><span class="nm">ii.</span><p><span class="cl">Question:</span> If so, why did the Torah specify sheep?</p></div>
<div class="indent3"><span class="nm">iii.</span><p><span class="cl">Answer:</span> It excludes fowl.</p></div>
<div class="subject"><span class="nm">3)</span><p>WHICH ALMONDS ARE TEVEL?</p></div>
<div class="indent1"><span class="nm">(a)</span><p><span class="cl">(Mishnah):</span> The kind (i.e. size) of bitter almonds that are Tevel (Ma'aser must be taken), such sweet almonds are exempt. The kind of sweet almonds that are Tevel, such bitter almonds are exempt.</p></div>
<div class="indent1"><span class="nm">(b)</span><p><span class="cl">(Gemara - Beraisa):</span> Small bitter almonds are Tevel. Large ones are exempt. Large sweet almonds are Tevel. Small ones are exempt;</p></div>
<div class="indent2"><span class="nm">1.</span><p><span class="cl">Version #1 (R. Yishmael b'Rebbi Yosi):</span> Both kinds (Rashi - small bitter or sweet; Tosfos - small or large bitter) are exempt.</p></div>
<div class="indent2"><span class="nm">2.</span><p><span class="cl">Version #2 (R. Yishmael b'Rebbi Yosi):</span> Both kinds (Rashi - large bitter or sweet; Tosfos - small or large bitter) are Tevel.</p></div>
<div class="indent3"><span class="nm">i.</span><p><span class="cl">Question:</span> Why are large (bitter) almonds Tevel? They are not proper to eat!</p></div>
<div class="indent3"><span class="nm">ii.</span><p><span class="cl">Answer:</span> They can be sweetened through cooking.</p></div>
<div class="subject"><span class="nm">4)</span><p>TEMED</p></div>
<div class="indent1"><span class="nm">(a)</span><p><span class="cl">(Mishnah):</span> If Temed (water that absorbed taste from dregs of wine, or from grape skins and pits) has not yet fermented, one may not buy it with money of Ma'aser Sheni;</p></div>
<div class="indent2"><span class="nm">1.</span><p>If (three Lugim of) such Temed was in a Kli and fell into an incomplete Mikveh (less than 40 Sa'im), this disqualifies the Mikveh (even if proper water is later added to it);</p></div>
<div class="indent1"><span class="nm">(b)</span><p>If it fermented, one may not buy it with Ma'aser money, and it does not disqualify a Mikveh.</p></div>
<div class="indent1"><span class="nm">(c)</span><p>If brothers split an inheritance -</p></div>
<div class="indent2"><span class="nm">1.</span><p>If they are obligated to add a Kalbon (a small coin added to the half-Shekel that one gives each year for Korbanos Tzibur) (i.e., they already divided the inheritance, and later made a partnership), they are exempt from Ma'aser Behemah (tithing animals born each year);</p></div>
<div class="indent2"><span class="nm">2.</span><p>If they are obligated in Ma'aser Behemah (i.e., before they divide the inheritance), they are exempt from adding a Kalbon.</p></div>
<div class="indent1"><span class="nm">(d)</span><p><span class="cl">(Gemara) Question:</span> The Mishnah is not like R. Yehudah, nor like Chachamim. Like whom is it?</p></div>
<div class="indent2"><span class="nm">1.</span><p><span class="cl">(Beraisa):</span> If Temed was made from Tevel dregs or grape pieces, and its volume is the same as the water put in, it is exempt from Ma'aseros;</p></div>
<div class="indent2"><span class="nm">2.</span><p>R. Yehudah obligates.</p></div>
<div class="indent3"><span class="nm">i.</span><p>The Mishnah is unlike Chachamim. They consider Temed to be water, even if it fermented!</p></div>
<div class="indent3"><span class="nm">ii.</span><p>It is unlike R. Yehudah. He considers Temed to be wine, even if it did not ferment!</p></div>
