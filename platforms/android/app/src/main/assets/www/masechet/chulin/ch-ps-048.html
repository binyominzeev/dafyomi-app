<div class="subject"><span class="nm">1)</span><p>LUNGS THAT STUCK TO THE RIBS</p></div>
<div class="indent1"><span class="nm">(a)</span><p><span class="cl">(Rav Yosef bar Minyomi citing Rav Nachman):</span> If a lung is stuck to the wall (of the rib cage), we are not concerned;</p></div>
<div class="indent2"><span class="nm">1.</span><p>If blisters sprouted, we are concerned.</p></div>
<div class="indent1"><span class="nm">(b)</span><p><span class="cl">(Mar Yehudah):</span> In both cases we are concerned.</p></div>
<div class="indent1"><span class="nm">(c)</span><p><span class="cl">Question:</span> How do we check it?</p></div>
<div class="indent1"><span class="nm">(d)</span><p><span class="cl">Answer (Rava):</span> One separates them with a sharp knife. If a wound is found on the wall, we attribute the blisters to it, and it is Kosher;</p></div>
<div class="indent2"><span class="nm">1.</span><p>If not, we assume that there was a hole in the lung, it is Tereifah (even if no air escapes when we blow into the lung (perhaps a scab covers the hole) - Bach deletes this from the text).</p></div>
<div class="indent2"><span class="nm">2.</span><p>Even if a wound was found on the wall, R. Nechemyah brei d'Rav Yosef would check it;</p></div>
<div class="indent3"><span class="nm">i.</span><p>He would put the lung in lukewarm water and blow into it. If bubbles appear, it is Tereifah.</p></div>
<div class="indent1"><span class="nm">(e)</span><p><span class="cl">(Mar Zutra brei d'Rav Huna brei d'Rav Papa):</span> I heard that R. Nechemyah's test was said regarding Rava's law.</p></div>
<div class="indent2"><span class="nm">1.</span><p><span class="cl">(Rava):</span> If a scab formed between two (non-adjacent) chambers of the lung, testing will not help. It is Tereifah;</p></div>
<div class="indent2"><span class="nm">2.</span><p>R. Nechemyah would test with warm water (like above).</p></div>
<div class="indent1"><span class="nm">(f)</span><p><span class="cl">Objection (Rav Ashi):</span> Granted, R. Nechemyah's test helps for a lung stuck to the wall. We can attribute the scab to a wound in the wall;</p></div>
<div class="indent2"><span class="nm">1.</span><p>In Rava's case, no matter which chamber is wounded, it is Tereifah!</p></div>
<div class="indent1"><span class="nm">(g)</span><p><span class="cl">Question:</span> Did Rav Nachman really say that if there are blisters, we are concerned?!</p></div>
<div class="indent2"><span class="nm">1.</span><p><span class="cl">Contradiction (Rav Nachman):</span> If the lung was punctured and the wall seals the wound, it is Kosher.</p></div>
<div class="indent1"><span class="nm">(h)</span><p><span class="cl">Answer (Ravina):</span> Rav Nachman is Machshir only if the lung sticks to the flesh between ribs.</p></div>
<div class="indent1"><span class="nm">(i)</span><p><span class="cl">Question (Rav Yosef):</span> Will you say that if the lung does not stick to the flesh between ribs, it is Tereifah, because there is a hole?!</p></div>
<div class="indent2"><span class="nm">1.</span><p>If so, even if the lung sticks to the flesh, it is Tereifah!</p></div>
<div class="indent2"><span class="nm">2.</span><p><span class="cl">(Beraisa):</span> If a man's Ever was punctured, he is a Petzu'a Daka (and forbidden to marry). If the hole was sealed, he can bear children, hence (he is not a Petzu'a Daka, and) he may marry. This is a Pseul that can become permitted.</p></div>
<div class="indent3"><span class="nm">i.</span><p><span class="cl">Suggestion:</span> 'This' excludes our case. (The sealing does not make the animal Kosher.)</p></div>
<div class="indent1"><span class="nm">(j)</span><p><span class="cl">Answer (Ravina):</span> No. It excludes a scab that forms on a hole in the lung. That does not help.</p></div>
<div class="indent1"><span class="nm">(k)</span><p><span class="cl">Question (Rav Ukva bar Chama):</span> (Ravina says that the wall may seal a hole in a lung.) If the wall would be punctured there, it would be Tereifah. If so, a punctured wall should be listed with the other Tereifos in our Mishnah!</p></div>
<div class="indent2"><span class="nm">1.</span><p><span class="cl">Counter-question:</span> R. Yitzchak bar Yosef taught that if the liver seals a punctured gall bladder, it is Kosher. If the liver would be punctured there, it would be Tereifah. Why doesn't the Mishnah list a punctured liver?</p></div>
<div class="indent2"><span class="nm">2.</span><p><span class="cl">Answer:</span> You must say that the Mishnah does not list a punctured liver because the animal is Tereifah due to the gall bladder.</p></div>
<div class="indent1"><span class="nm">(l)</span><p><span class="cl">Answer:</span> Here also, a punctured wall it is not listed because it is Tereifah due to the lung!</p></div>
<div class="subject"><span class="nm">2)</span><p>BLISTERS</p></div>
<div class="indent1"><span class="nm">(a)</span><p><span class="cl">Question (Rabah bar bar Chanah):</span> If blisters developed on the lungs, what is the law?</p></div>
<div class="indent1"><span class="nm">(b)</span><p><span class="cl">Answer (Shmuel):</span> It is Kosher.</p></div>
<div class="indent2"><span class="nm">1.</span><p><span class="cl">Rabah bar bar Chanah:</span> I agree, but the Talmidim waver about this due to Rav Masnah's law;</p></div>
<div class="indent3"><span class="nm">i.</span><p><span class="cl">(Rav Masnah):</span> If a blister is full of puss, it is Tereifah. If it is full of clear water, it is Kosher.</p></div>
<div class="indent2"><span class="nm">2.</span><p><span class="cl">Shmuel:</span> That was said regarding the kidney.</p></div>
<div class="indent1"><span class="nm">(c)</span><p>R. Yitzchak bar Yosef wanted to see if R. Yirmeyah would buy meat of an animal whose lungs were full of blisters. R. Yirmeyah declined.</p></div>
<div class="indent2"><span class="nm">1.</span><p><span class="cl">R. Yirmeyah:</span> When people ask R. Yochanan about such animals, he tells them to ask R. Yehudah b'Rebbi Shimon, who has a tradition that it is Kosher. R. Yochanan himself is not inclined to say this.</p></div>
<div class="indent1"><span class="nm">(d)</span><p><span class="cl">(Rava):</span> Rav Nachman saw meat for sale. There were large blisters on the lungs. He said nothing.</p></div>
<div class="bbbline">48b----------------------------------------48b</p></div>
<div class="indent2"><span class="nm">1.</span><p>R. Ami and R. Asi saw meat for sale. There were giant, rock-hard blisters on the lungs. They said nothing.</p></div>
<div class="subject"><span class="nm">3)</span><p>A NEEDLE IN THE LUNGS OR LIVER</p></div>
<div class="indent1"><span class="nm">(a)</span><p><span class="cl">(R. Yochanan (and R. Elazar...)):</span> If a needle is found in the lungs, it is Kosher;</p></div>
<div class="indent1"><span class="nm">(b)</span><p><span class="cl">(Reish Lakish (and...)):</span> It is Tereifah.</p></div>
<div class="indent1"><span class="nm">(c)</span><p><span class="cl">Suggestion:</span> They argue whether a Chisaron in the interior of the lungs ('consumed' by the needle) is problematic.</p></div>
<div class="indent1"><span class="nm">(d)</span><p><span class="cl">Rejection:</span> No. All agree that this is not a problem;</p></div>
<div class="indent2"><span class="nm">1.</span><p>Rather, R. Yochanan assumes that the needle came through the Kaneh (even a hole up to half the circumference of the Kaneh does not make it Tereifah);</p></div>
<div class="indent2"><span class="nm">2.</span><p>Reish Lakish is concerned lest it came through the Veshet (and punctured the intestines or lungs on the way, making it Tereifah).</p></div>
<div class="indent1"><span class="nm">(e)</span><p>A case occurred in which a needle was found in a piece of the lungs. R. Ami wanted to be Machshir.</p></div>
<div class="indent1"><span class="nm">(f)</span><p><span class="cl">Question (R. Yirmeyah - Mishnah):</span> If the lungs were punctured or Chaser (it is Tereifah).</p></div>
<div class="indent2"><span class="nm">1.</span><p><span class="cl">Question:</span> What is the case of Chaser?</p></div>
<div class="indent3"><span class="nm">i.</span><p><span class="cl">Suggestion:</span> The Chisaron extends to the outside.</p></div>
<div class="indent3"><span class="nm">ii.</span><p><span class="cl">Rejection:</span> We already know this case, for it is punctured!</p></div>
<div class="indent2"><span class="nm">2.</span><p><span class="cl">Answer:</span> Rather, it is an internal Chisaron. The Mishnah says that it is Tereifah!</p></div>
<div class="indent1"><span class="nm">(g)</span><p>They asked R. Yitzchak Nafcha. Also he wanted to be Machshir. They asked R. Yirmeyah's question. R. Ami (Shitah Mekubetzes - R. Yitzchak) retracted, and ruled that it is Tereifah.</p></div>
<div class="indent1"><span class="nm">(h)</span><p><span class="cl">Question:</span> R. Yochanan (and...) is (are) Machshir!</p></div>
<div class="indent1"><span class="nm">(i)</span><p><span class="cl">Answer (R. Ami or R. Yitzchak):</span> That is when the lungs were whole. One could see that they were not punctured. Here, we see only part of the lungs. Perhaps another part was punctured,</p></div>
<div class="indent1"><span class="nm">(j)</span><p><span class="cl">Inference:</span> If the lungs were in front of us and not punctured, it would be Kosher!</p></div>
<div class="indent1"><span class="nm">(k)</span><p><span class="cl">Question:</span> Rav Nachman taught that if a branch of the lung is punctured, it is Tereifah!</p></div>
<div class="indent1"><span class="nm">(l)</span><p><span class="cl">Answer:</span> That is when the puncture goes from one branch to another.</p></div>
<div class="indent1"><span class="nm">(m)</span><p><span class="cl">Question:</span> Rav Nachman taught that if the small intestines were punctured where they touch, it is Kosher, for they protect each other.</p></div>
<div class="indent1"><span class="nm">(n)</span><p><span class="cl">Answer (Rav Ashi):</span> One cannot compare Tereifos. A cut in one place makes an animal die, but it can survive a cut in another (seemingly worse) place!</p></div>
<div class="indent1"><span class="nm">(o)</span><p>A needle was found in the great chamber of the lungs. Reish Lakish (and...), who said that a needle found in the lungs is Tereifah, did not want to rule about this.</p></div>
<div class="indent2"><span class="nm">1.</span><p>They did not permit it, for they are concerned lest it came through the Veshet.</p></div>
<div class="indent2"><span class="nm">2.</span><p>They did not forbid it. Since it was found in the great chamber, it is more likely that it came through the Kaneh.</p></div>
<div class="indent1"><span class="nm">(p)</span><p>A needle was found in a piece of the liver. Mar brei d'Rav Yosef was about to rule that it is Tereifah.</p></div>
<div class="indent2"><span class="nm">1.</span><p><span class="cl">Rav Ashi:</span> Would you say the same if it was found in flesh? (Since a punctured liver is not Tereifah, regarding a needle, it is like flesh!)</p></div>
<div class="indent1"><span class="nm">(q)</span><p>(Rav Ashi) Rather, we see which way the needle points. If the needle's head is inside the liver, it surely came through the Kaneh (and it is Kosher). If the head is outside, it surely came through the Veshet (and it is Tereifah).</p></div>
<div class="indent2"><span class="nm">1.</span><p>This distinction applies only to a thick needle. If it is thin, we are concerned lest it came through the Veshet no matter which direction it faces.</p></div>
