<div class="subject"><span class="nm">1)</span><p>LIABILITY FOR <i>SHECHUTEI CHUTZ</i></p></div>
<div class="indent1"><span class="nm">(a)</span><p><span class="cl">(Mishnah):</span> (One is exempt for...) Rove'a or Nirva... (We learn from "Lifnei Mishkan Hash-m.")</p></div>
<div class="indent1"><span class="nm">(b)</span><p><span class="cl">Question:</span> These are not proper for Pesach Ohel Mo'ed. Why don't we learn from "v'El Pesach Ohel Mo'ed..."?</p></div>
<div class="indent1"><span class="nm">(c)</span><p><span class="cl">Answer - part 1:</span> For Rove'a and Nirva, we need another verse to teach about when the Aveirah was done after it was Hukdash;</p></div>
<div class="indent2"><span class="nm">1.</span><p>This answer does not suffice for Ne'evad and Muktzeh. We must say that it was Ne'evad or Muktzeh before Hekdesh, for after Hekdesh, (since an action was not done to the animal itself,) only the owner can forbid it! (Once it is Hekdesh, he ceases to own it.)</p></div>
<div class="indent1"><span class="nm">(d)</span><p><span class="cl">Answer - part 2:</span> Also regarding Ne'evad and Muktzeh, another verse is needed to teach about when the Aveirah was done after it was Hukdash;</p></div>
<div class="indent2"><span class="nm">1.</span><p>The case is, the Korban is Kodshim Kalim. The Mishnah is like R. Yosi ha'Galili, who says that Kodshim Kalim are considered to be the property of the owner.</p></div>
<div class="indent2"><span class="nm">2.</span><p><span class="cl">(Beraisa - R. Yosi ha'Galili):</span> "U'Ma'alah Ma'al ba'Shem" includes Kodshim Kalim, which are the property of the owner.</p></div>
<div class="indent1"><span class="nm">(e)</span><p>The Isurim of Rove'a and Nirva take effect on Kodshim, for it is Ervah (we learn from "Mashchasam (Arayos or idolatry) Bam Mum Bam");</p></div>
<div class="indent1"><span class="nm">(f)</span><p>The Isurim of Ne'evad and Muktzeh take effect on Kodshim Kalim, for it is idolatry;</p></div>
<div class="indent1"><span class="nm">(g)</span><p>The Isurim of Mechir, Esnan, Kilayim, and Yotzei Dofen take effect on the child of a Korban;</p></div>
<div class="indent2"><span class="nm">1.</span><p>The Tana holds that the child of a Korban does not become Kodesh until it is born. (The owner can sell or give then until birth. This allows the Isur of Mechir or Esnan to take effect. All of these were considered proper for Pesach Ohel Mo'ed in the womb, before the Pesul occurred. Therefore, we cannot learn from "v'El Pesach Ohel Mo'ed." We need "Lifnei Mishkan Hash-m" to exempt them.)</p></div>
<div class="indent1"><span class="nm">(h)</span><p><span class="cl">(Mishnah):</span> (One is exempt for) a Ba'al Mum... for Oso v'Es Beno...</p></div>
<div class="indent1"><span class="nm">(i)</span><p>We must teach all these cases;</p></div>
<div class="indent2"><span class="nm">1.</span><p>Had we only taught Ba'al Mum, one might have thought that Chachamim exempt for it because it is repulsive, but Torim (that are too young) are not repulsive. They would admit to R. Shimon that one is liable for them!</p></div>
<div class="indent2"><span class="nm">2.</span><p>If we only taught Torim, one might have thought that R. Shimon obligates for them because they were never fit to be offered, but a Ba'al Mum was fit and Nidcheh. He would admit to Chachamim that one is exempt for it!</p></div>
<div class="indent2"><span class="nm">3.</span><p>If we only taught these two, one might have thought that Chachamim exempt for them because they are intrinsically forbidden, but Oso v'Es Beno is forbidden due to something else (the Shechitah of its mother or son), and they would admit to R. Shimon that one is liable for it!</p></div>
<div class="subject"><span class="nm">2)</span><p>LIABILITY FOR <i>MECHUSAR ZEMAN</i></p></div>
<div class="indent1"><span class="nm">(a)</span><p><span class="cl">(Mishnah - R. Shimon):</span> (For anything proper to be offered later, one transgresses a Lav, but there is no Kares.)</p></div>
<div class="indent1"><span class="nm">(b)</span><p><span class="cl">Question:</span> What is his reason?</p></div>
<div class="indent1"><span class="nm">(c)</span><p><span class="cl">Answer #1 (R. Ilai):</span> "Lo Sa'asun k'Chol Asher Anachnu Osim Po ha'Yom" - Moshe told Yisrael that when they enter Eretz Yisrael (and set up the Mishkan in Giglal), one may offer "Kol ha'Yashar b'Einav" (voluntary offerings, i.e. Nedarim and Nedavos), but not obligatory offerings;</p></div>
<div class="indent2"><span class="nm">1.</span><p>Obligatory offerings will be Mechusar Zeman, for they may not be offered until a Mikdash will be built in Shilo, and a Lav "Lo Sa'asun" forbids them!</p></div>
<div class="indent1"><span class="nm">(d)</span><p><span class="cl">Question (R. Yirmeyah):</span> If so, one should be lashed for this;</p></div>
<div class="bbbline">114b----------------------------------------114b</p></div>
<div class="indent2"><span class="nm">1.</span><p>However, R. Zeira taught that the Torah reduced the severity (of Mechusar Zeman from a Lav) to an Aseh!</p></div>
<div class="indent1"><span class="nm">(e)</span><p><span class="cl">Answer #1:</span> R. Zeira's teaching is according to Chachamim. R. Shimon holds that he is lashed.</p></div>
<div class="indent1"><span class="nm">(f)</span><p><span class="cl">Answer #2 (Rav Nachman bar Yitzchak):</span> (Even R. Shimon exempts for Mechusar Zeman of obligatory offerings offered in Gilgal.) Since they may be offered only (in "Menuchah", i.e. the Mikdash) in Shilo, it is as if they were offered outside the Mikdash;</p></div>
<div class="indent2"><span class="nm">1.</span><p>He is Mechayev for Shechutei Chutz at the time the Mishkan was in Gilgal.</p></div>
<div class="indent1"><span class="nm">(g)</span><p><span class="cl">Answer #2 (to Question (b) - Rabah):</span> R. Shimon learns as follows:</p></div>
<div class="indent2"><span class="nm">1.</span><p><span class="cl">(Beraisa - R. Shimon):</span> "Lo Suchal Lizbo'ach Es ha'Posach" is a Lav against slaughtering Pesach on a private Bamah when Bamos are forbidden;</p></div>
<div class="indent2"><span class="nm">2.</span><p><span class="cl">Suggestion:</span> Perhaps this applies to even when Bamos are permitted!</p></div>
<div class="indent2"><span class="nm">3.</span><p><span class="cl">Rejection:</span> The Lav is only when all of Yisrael enter "b'Echad She'arecha" (one gate), i.e. there is a Mikdash and Bamos are forbidden. (end of Beraisa)</p></div>
<div class="indent2"><span class="nm">4.</span><p><span class="cl">Question:</span> What time is discussed?</p></div>
<div class="indent2"><span class="nm">5.</span><p><span class="cl">Answer #1:</span> It discusses the afternoon (of Erev Pesach).</p></div>
<div class="indent2"><span class="nm">6.</span><p><span class="cl">Rejection:</span> Pesach is fully proper inside the Mikdash. One who slaughters it outside is Chayav Kares!</p></div>
<div class="indent2"><span class="nm">7.</span><p><span class="cl">Answer #2:</span> Rather, it discusses the morning (of Erev Pesach. Even though it is Mechusar Zeman, a Lav forbids it!)</p></div>
<div class="indent1"><span class="nm">(h)</span><p><span class="cl">Rejection (and defense of Answer #1):</span> Really, it discusses the afternoon, and at a time when Bamos are permitted.</p></div>
<div class="indent1"><span class="nm">(i)</span><p><span class="cl">Question:</span> The Beraisa expounds that the verse discusses when Bamos are forbidden!</p></div>
<div class="indent1"><span class="nm">(j)</span><p><span class="cl">Answer:</span> It means, the Pesach is forbidden on this (i.e. a private) Bamah and permitted on another Bamah (of the Tzibur.)</p></div>
<div class="subject"><span class="nm">3)</span><p><i>MECHUSAR ZEMAN</i> OF THE OWNER</p></div>
<div class="indent1"><span class="nm">(a)</span><p><span class="cl">(Mishnah):</span> Mechusar Zeman (of the owner - if a Zav, Zavah or Yoledes offered his (or her) Chatas or Asham, he is exempt.)</p></div>
<div class="indent1"><span class="nm">(b)</span><p><span class="cl">Question:</span> These people do not offer an Asham!</p></div>
<div class="indent1"><span class="nm">(c)</span><p><span class="cl">Answer (Ze'iri):</span> The text of the Mishnah should include also a Metzora. (He brings an Asham.)</p></div>
<div class="indent1"><span class="nm">(d)</span><p><span class="cl">(Mishnah):</span> If he offered his Olah or Shelamim (he is liable...)</p></div>
<div class="indent1"><span class="nm">(e)</span><p><span class="cl">Question:</span> These people do not offer Shelamim!</p></div>
<div class="indent1"><span class="nm">(f)</span><p><span class="cl">Answer (Rav Sheshes):</span> The text of the Mishnah should include also a Nazir.</p></div>
<div class="indent1"><span class="nm">(g)</span><p>People adopted Ze'iri's correction (they would include Metzora when reciting the Mishnah), but not Rav Sheshes' correction. (Tosfos - this is because Nazir is less similar to the others. He is not Tamei.)</p></div>
<div class="indent1"><span class="nm">(h)</span><p><span class="cl">(Rav Chilkiya bar Tuvi):</span> (The Mishnah exempts for an Asham Mechusar Zeman, e.g. of a Metzora.) This is only if it was offered Lishmah;</p></div>
<div class="indent2"><span class="nm">1.</span><p>If it was offered Lo Lishmah, he is liable, since if he offered it Lo Lishmah inside, it would be Kosher.</p></div>
<div class="indent1"><span class="nm">(i)</span><p><span class="cl">Question:</span> If so, also if it was offered Lishmah he should be liable, since it was proper to be offered inside Lo Lishmah!</p></div>
<div class="indent1"><span class="nm">(j)</span><p><span class="cl">Answer:</span> Until one is Oker it (changes it to a different Korban), we consider it like the original Korban, so it cannot be offered inside.</p></div>
