<p class="bas subject"><span class="nm">1)</span>DO WE BELIEVE A SHECHIV MERA? (cont.)</p>
<p class="bas indent1"><span class="nm">(a)</span><span class="cl">Answer:</span> Rav Huna discusses when Ploni has a document (therefore, we believe that he is owed).</p>
<p class="bas indent1"><span class="nm">(b)</span><span class="cl">Inference:</span> Rav and Shmuel discuss when Ploni does not have a document.</p>
<p class="bas indent1"><span class="nm">(c)</span><span class="cl">Objection:</span> When he says 'give', why do we give? This is (like a creditor trying to collect from buyers) a loan without a document!</p>
<p class="bas indent2"><span class="nm">1.</span><span class="cl">(Rav and Shmuel):</span> A loan without a document is not collected from heirs or buyers.</p>
<p class="bas indent1"><span class="nm">(d)</span><span class="cl">(Rav Nachman):</span> Rather, also Rav and Shmuel discuss when Ploni has a document;</p>
<p class="bas indent2"><span class="nm">1.</span>Rav Huna discusses a validated document. Rav and Shmuel discuss a document that is not validated;</p>
<p class="bas indent3"><span class="nm">i.</span>If he says 'give', this is like validating the document. If he did not say 'give', he did not validate the document.</p>
<p class="bas indent1"><span class="nm">(e)</span><span class="cl">(Rabah):</span> If a Shechiv Mera said '100 Zuz in my possession really belongs to Ploni', and his orphans say 'we paid Ploni', they are believed;</p>
<p class="bas indent2"><span class="nm">1.</span>If he said 'give 100 Zuz to Ploni', and his orphans say 'we paid Ploni', they are not believed.</p>
<p class="bas indent1"><span class="nm">(f)</span><span class="cl">Question:</span> Just the contrary! When he says 'give', the matter is clear, so it is more likely that they paid;</p>
<p class="bas indent2"><span class="nm">1.</span>When he says '100 Zuz in my possession belongs to Ploni', the matter is not clear, so it is less likely that they paid!</p>
<p class="bas indent1"><span class="nm">(g)</span><span class="cl">Correction:</span> Rather, if a Shechiv Mera said '100 Zuz in my possession belongs to Ploni', and his orphans say 'later, he told us that he paid Ploni', they are believed;</p>
<p class="bas indent2"><span class="nm">1.</span><span class="cl">Question:</span> What is the reason?</p>
<p class="bas indent2"><span class="nm">2.</span><span class="cl">Answer:</span> Later, he remembered that he had paid.</p>
<p class="bas indent2"><span class="nm">3.</span>If he said 'give 100 Zuz to Ploni', and his orphans say 'later, he told us that he paid Ploni', they are not believed;</p>
<p class="bas indent3"><span class="nm">i.</span>Had he paid, he would not have said 'give' (which shows certainty that he owes).</p>
<p class="bas indent1"><span class="nm">(h)</span><span class="cl">Question (Rava):</span> If a Shechiv Mera admitted (to a creditor who claimed from him), what is the law?</p>
<p class="bas indent2"><span class="nm">1.</span>Must he say 'you are witnesses (that I really owe him)'?</p>
<p class="bas indent2"><span class="nm">2.</span>Must he say 'you may write a document'?</p>
<p class="bas indent2"><span class="nm">3.</span>Does one jest at the time of death (and make a false admission), or not?</p>
<p class="bas indent1"><span class="nm">(i)</span><span class="cl">Answer (Rava):</span> One does not jest at the time of death. What a Shechiv Mera says takes effect like a document that was handed over.</p>
<p class="bas subject"><span class="nm">2)</span>LIABILITY OF AN AREV</p>
<p class="bas indent1"><span class="nm">(a)</span><span class="cl">(Mishnah):</span> If Reuven lent to Shimon and wrote a document, he can collect even from Meshubadim (property that the borrower sold after he borrowed);</p>
<p class="bas indent2"><span class="nm">1.</span>A Milveh Al Peh (a loan for which no document was written) is collected only from Bnei Chorin (property that the borrower still owns).</p>
<p class="bas bbbline">175b----------------------------------------175b</p>
<p class="bas indent2"><span class="nm">2.</span>If Reuven presents a document (without signatures) in Shimon's handwriting saying that Shimon owes him, he collects from Bnei Chorin.</p>
<p class="bas indent1"><span class="nm">(b)</span>If an Arev accepted Arvus in a document underneath the signatures, the lender can collect from Bnei Chorin (of the Arev).</p>
<p class="bas indent1"><span class="nm">(c)</span>A case occurred in which R. Yishmael said that he collects from Bnei Chorin.</p>
<p class="bas indent1"><span class="nm">(d)</span><span class="cl">Ben Nanas:</span> He does not collect at all!</p>
<p class="bas indent1"><span class="nm">(e)</span><span class="cl">R. Yishmael:</span> Why not?</p>
<p class="bas indent1"><span class="nm">(f)</span><span class="cl">Ben Nanas:</span> If Reuven saw Shimon (the lender) choking the borrower, and said 'leave him alone, and I will give to you', Reuven is exempt, for Shimon did not lend due to Reuven;</p>
<p class="bas indent2"><span class="nm">1.</span>An Arev is liable if he said 'lend to him, and I will give to you', for the loan was given due to the Arev.</p>
<p class="bas indent1"><span class="nm">(g)</span><span class="cl">R. Yishmael:</span> To become a Chacham, one should study monetary laws. It is the greatest field in Torah;</p>
<p class="bas indent2"><span class="nm">1.</span>To learn monetary laws, one should study under Ben Nanas.</p>
<p class="bas subject"><span class="nm">3)</span>WHAT CREATES A LIEN?</p>
<p class="bas indent1"><span class="nm">(a)</span><span class="cl">(Gemara - Ula):</span> Mid'Oraisa, whether or not a document was written for a loan, the lender may collect from Meshubadim (property that the borrower sold after he borrowed).</p>
<p class="bas indent2"><span class="nm">1.</span>This is because Shibud (the lien on a borrower's property to pay the loan) is mid'Oraisa. (A sale does not uproot the lien.)</p>
<p class="bas indent2"><span class="nm">2.</span>Chachamim enacted that one may not collect a Milveh Al Peh from Meshubadim to protect buyers from losing.</p>
<p class="bas indent1"><span class="nm">(b)</span><span class="cl">Question:</span> If so, they should have enacted also that one may not collect a loan with a document from Meshubadim, to protect buyers!</p>
<p class="bas indent1"><span class="nm">(c)</span><span class="cl">Answer:</span> There (when a document was signed, the matter becomes known. If a buyer asks, he will find out about the loan. If he did not do so), he caused his own loss.</p>
<p class="bas indent1"><span class="nm">(d)</span><span class="cl">(Rabah):</span> Mid'Oraisa, whether or not a document was written, the lender does not collect from Meshubadim.</p>
<p class="bas indent2"><span class="nm">1.</span>Shibud is not Mid'Oraisa. Chachamim enacted that a loan document is collected from Meshubadim due to Ne'ilas Delet (lest people be dissuaded from lending).</p>
<p class="bas indent1"><span class="nm">(e)</span><span class="cl">Question:</span> If so, they should have enacted also that a Milveh Al Peh is collected from Meshubadim!</p>
<p class="bas indent1"><span class="nm">(f)</span><span class="cl">Answer:</span> There, the loan does not become known. (Buyers have no way to find out about the loan, and they will lose.)</p>
<p class="bas indent1"><span class="nm">(g)</span><span class="cl">Contradiction:</span> Rabah taught that if brothers collected land for a debt due to their father, the firstborn gets a double share in this. (This is because the land was already Meshubad in the father's lifetime. It is as if the father owned it.) If they collected money, he gets no extra share.</p>
<p class="bas indent2"><span class="nm">1.</span><span class="cl">Suggestion:</span> We must switch the opinions of Ula and Rabah.</p>
<p class="bas indent2"><span class="nm">2.</span><span class="cl">Rejection:</span> Ula taught that mid'Oraisa, a creditor collects Ziburis (low quality land). (Rashbam - he collects from the borrower mid'Oraisa, i.e. there is a lien on his land. Tosfos - all agree that mid'Oraisa, a lender collects from the borrower's property. Perhaps the Gemara understands that Ula says that mid'Oraisa he collects Ziburis from buyers.)</p>
<p class="bas indent1"><span class="nm">(h)</span><span class="cl">Answer:</span> Rather, Rabah's law (about the firstborn) is according to Chachamim of Eretz Yisrael (like it says in Bava Kama 43a). He himself disagrees.</p>
<p class="bas indent1"><span class="nm">(i)</span><span class="cl">(Rav and Shmuel):</span> A Milveh Al Peh is not collected from heirs or buyers.</p>
<p class="bas indent1"><span class="nm">(j)</span>This is because Shibud is not mid'Oraisa.</p>
<p class="bas indent1"><span class="nm">(k)</span><span class="cl">(R. Yochanan and Reish Lakish):</span> A Milveh Al Peh is collected from heirs and buyers.</p>
<p class="bas indent1"><span class="nm">(l)</span>This is because Shibud is mid'Oraisa.</p>
<p class="bas indent1"><span class="nm">(m)</span><span class="cl">Question (against Rav and Shmuel - Beraisa):</span> If Reuven was digging a pit in the Reshus ha'Rabim and an animal fell on him and killed him, the owner is exempt. Further, if the animal died, Reuven's heirs compensate its owner.</p>
<p class="bas indent1"><span class="nm">(n)</span><span class="cl">Answer (R. Ila'a citing Rav):</span> The case is, Reuven died after Beis Din obligated him to pay. (A ruling of Beis Din is like a loan document, therefore the heirs must pay.)</p>
<p class="bas indent1"><span class="nm">(o)</span><span class="cl">Question:</span> The Beraisa says that the animal killed Reuven!</p>
<p class="bas indent1"><span class="nm">(p)</span><span class="cl">Answer (Rav Ada bar Ahavah):</span> The case is, it made Reuven a Treifah.</p>
<p class="bas indent1"><span class="nm">(q)</span><span class="cl">Question:</span> Rav Nachman taught that the animal buried Reuven in the pit (i.e. he never went to Beis Din)!</p>
<p class="bas indent1"><span class="nm">(r)</span><span class="cl">Answer:</span> The case is, judges were sitting by the pit and they obligated Reuven before he died.</p>
<p class="bas indent1"><span class="nm">(s)</span><span class="cl">(Rav Papa):</span> The Halachah is, a Milveh Al Peh is collected from heirs, but not from buyers.</p>
<p class="bas indent2"><span class="nm">1.</span>It is collected from heirs, due to Ne'ilas Delet;</p>
<p class="bas indent2"><span class="nm">2.</span>It is not collected from buyers, because it does not become known.</p>
