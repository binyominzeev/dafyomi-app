<p class="bas subject"><span class="nm">1)</span>WHEN A <i>CHACHAM</i> MAY LIE</p>
<p class="bas indent1"><span class="nm">(a)</span><span class="cl">(Rav Yehudah):</span> Chachamim may lie to cover up three things: (knowing) a tractate, bed (when they had Bi'ah), and (a host who gave to him good) hospitality (lest unfitting people flock to the host).</p>
<p class="bas indent1"><span class="nm">(b)</span><span class="cl">Question:</span> What is the significance of this teaching?</p>
<p class="bas indent1"><span class="nm">(c)</span><span class="cl">Answer (Mar Zutra):</span> One who lies only about these three things is considered a Chacham to whom we return an Aveidah if he recognizes it.</p>
<p class="bas indent1"><span class="nm">(d)</span>A silver cup was stolen from Mar Zutra Chasida's host. He noticed a Talmid drying his hands on someone else's garment. He reasoned that if the Talmid does not mind using another's property, he is the thief. He confronted him, and the Talmid confessed.</p>
<p class="bas subject"><span class="nm">2)</span>WHAT R. SHIMON BEN ELAZAR PERMITS</p>
<p class="bas indent1"><span class="nm">(a)</span><span class="cl">(Beraisa):</span> R. Shimon ben Elazar agrees that if one found new Kelim that people recognize, he must announce them.</p>
<p class="bas indent1"><span class="nm">(b)</span>The following Kelim, when new, are not recognized: Badei (sticks from which stick out) needles or hooks, or a string of forks (for weaving gold).</p>
<p class="bas indent1"><span class="nm">(c)</span>These are permitted when only one is found. If two are found, he must announce them.</p>
<p class="bas indent2"><span class="nm">1.</span>'Badei' means branches, like a Mishnah teaches (that the minimum requirement for willow branches is) one leaf on each Bad (branch).</p>
<p class="bas indent1"><span class="nm">(d)</span><span class="cl">(Beraisa #1 - R. Shimon ben Elazar):</span> One may keep the following: what he saves from a lion, bear, leopard, polecat, what was taken by a high tide or an overflowing river, and what he finds in a big encampment or thoroughfare, or any place where many people pass;</p>
<p class="bas indent2"><span class="nm">1.</span>This is because the owner despairs.</p>
<p class="bas indent1"><span class="nm">(e)</span><span class="cl">Question #1:</span> Did R. Shimon ben Elazar say this only in a city that is mostly Nochrim, or even in a city that is mostly Yisre'elim?</p>
<p class="bas indent2"><span class="nm">1.</span><span class="cl">Question #2:</span> If he said so even in a city that is mostly Yisre'elim, do Chachamim disagree?</p>
<p class="bas indent2"><span class="nm">2.</span><span class="cl">Question #3:</span> If Chachamim disagree, is this only in a city that is mostly Yisre'elim, or even in a city that is mostly Nochrim?</p>
<p class="bas indent2"><span class="nm">3.</span><span class="cl">Question #4:</span> If you will say that Chachamim argue even in a city that is mostly Nochrim, does the Halachah follow R. Shimon?</p>
<p class="bas indent2"><span class="nm">4.</span><span class="cl">Question #5:</span> If you will say that the Halachah follows R. Shimon, is that only in a city that is mostly Nochrim, or even in a city that is mostly Yisre'elim?</p>
<p class="bas indent1"><span class="nm">(f)</span><span class="cl">Answer #1 (to Question #1 - Beraisa #2):</span> If one finds coins in a Beis Keneses, Beis Medrash or any place where many people go, he may keep them, because the owner despairs.</p>
<p class="bas indent2"><span class="nm">1.</span>The Tana must be R. Shimon ben Elazar, who follows the Rov (Rashi - he permits in places where many pass), and he permits even in a Beis Keneses, where mostly Yisre'elim go! (Our Gemara supports Rashi, for it learns from Beraisa #1 that R. Shimon follows the Rov, and Beraisa #1 does not mention a majority, only places where many pass. However, Tosfos explains 'follows the Rov, i.e. majority,' in its normal context. Answer #2 below supports this. Perhaps our Gemara understands that he permits in places where many pass <i>because</i> he follows the majority regarding Metzi'os.)</p>
<p class="bas indent1"><span class="nm">(g)</span><span class="cl">Rejection #1:</span> The case is, the coins are scattered. (Even Chachamim in our Mishnah permit this.)</p>
<p class="bas indent1"><span class="nm">(h)</span><span class="cl">Objection:</span> The Tana permits only in a place where many people go!</p>
<p class="bas indent1"><span class="nm">(i)</span><span class="cl">Rejection #2:</span> Really, the coins are wrapped together. The Beraisa refers to a Beis Keneses (meeting place) of Nochrim.</p>
<p class="bas indent2"><span class="nm">1.</span><span class="cl">Question:</span> The Beraisa permits also in a Beis Medrash. How can we answer that?</p>
<p class="bas indent2"><span class="nm">2.</span><span class="cl">Answer:</span> It is a Beis Medrash of Yisre'elim, but Nochrim stay in it (to guard it. Rashba - the Nochrim are <i>considered</i> the majority, for they live there and search it.)</p>
<p class="bas indent1"><span class="nm">(j)</span><span class="cl">Rejection #3:</span> Also regarding a Beis Keneses, we can say that it is of Yisre'elim, but Nochrim stay in it.</p>
<p class="bas indent1"><span class="nm">(k)</span><span class="cl">Answer #2 (to Question #1 - Mishnah):</span> If one found an Aveidah in a city with Yisre'elim and Nochrim, if the majority are Yisrael, he must announce it. If the majority are Nochrim, he need not announce it;</p>
<p class="bas indent2"><span class="nm">1.</span>The Tana must be R. Shimon, who follows the Rov, and he permits only when the majority are Nochrim!</p>
<p class="bas indent1"><span class="nm">(l)</span><span class="cl">Rejection:</span> No, the Tana holds like Chachamim.</p>
<p class="bas indent1"><span class="nm">(m)</span><span class="cl">Answer (to Question #3):</span> This shows that Chachamim admit to R. Shimon ben Elazar when the majority are Nochrim!</p>
<p class="bas indent1"><span class="nm">(n)</span><span class="cl">Rejection #1:</span> Really, the Tana is R. Shimon, and he permits even in a city that is mostly Yisre'elim;</p>
<p class="bas indent2"><span class="nm">1.</span>In the Mishnah, the Aveidah was covered.</p>
<p class="bas indent2"><span class="nm">2.</span><span class="cl">Question:</span> If so, he may not touch it!</p>
<p class="bas indent3"><span class="nm">i.</span><span class="cl">(Mishnah):</span> If one finds a Kli in a waste heap, if it was covered, he may not touch it. If it was exposed, he takes it and announces.</p>
<p class="bas indent2"><span class="nm">3.</span><span class="cl">Answer (like Rav Papa said elsewhere):</span> It is a waste heap that is not frequently cleared out, and the owner decided to clear it out. (Therefore, even though it is covered, the finder takes it.)</p>
<p class="bas bbbline">24b----------------------------------------24b</p>
<p class="bas indent1"><span class="nm">(o)</span><span class="cl">Rejection #2:</span> Really, the Tana of the Mishnah holds like Chachamim. They did not say that when the majority is Nochrim it is his, just that he need not announce it;</p>
<p class="bas indent2"><span class="nm">1.</span>If a Yisrael will give a Siman, he must return it to the Yisrael.</p>
<p class="bas indent1"><span class="nm">(p)</span><span class="cl">Answer #3 (to Question #1 - Rav Asi):</span> If one finds a barrel of wine in a city that is mostly Nochrim, he may keep it (regarding laws of Metzi'os), but he may not benefit from it (for it is probably wine of Nochrim);</p>
<p class="bas indent2"><span class="nm">1.</span>If a Yisrael gives a Siman, the finder (keeps it and) may drink it.</p>
<p class="bas indent2"><span class="nm">2.</span>This is like R. Shimon. He permits only when the majority are Nochrim!</p>
<p class="bas indent1"><span class="nm">(q)</span><span class="cl">Rejection:</span> Really, R. Shimon permits even when the majority are Yisre'elim. Rav Asi holds like R. Shimon only when the majority are Nochrim.</p>
<p class="bas indent1"><span class="nm">(r)</span><span class="cl">Question:</span> Since one may not benefit from it, why bother saying that he may keep it (regarding laws of Metzi'os)?</p>
<p class="bas indent1"><span class="nm">(s)</span><span class="cl">Answer (Rav Ashi):</span> He may use the Kli that it was in.</p>
<p class="bas subject"><span class="nm">3)</span><i>METZI'OS</i> IN PUBLIC PLACES</p>
<p class="bas indent1"><span class="nm">(a)</span>A man found four Zuz wrapped in a sheet and thrown in the river Biran. Rav Yehudah ruled that he must announce it.</p>
<p class="bas indent1"><span class="nm">(b)</span><span class="cl">Question:</span> This is like something taken by a high tide. (Surely, the owner despaired!)</p>
<p class="bas indent1"><span class="nm">(c)</span><span class="cl">Answer:</span> The river Biran is different. Since they dam it up, the owner would not despair.</p>
<p class="bas indent1"><span class="nm">(d)</span><span class="cl">Inference:</span> The majority of people there are Nochrim. This shows that the Halachah does not follow R. Shimon, even regarding a majority of Nochrim!</p>
<p class="bas indent1"><span class="nm">(e)</span><span class="cl">Rejection:</span> Most of the people who dam up the river and dig it out (to let the water flow) are Yisre'elim, therefore he does not despair.</p>
<p class="bas indent1"><span class="nm">(f)</span><span class="cl">Question (Rav Yehudah):</span> If one found a wallet in the market of shredded wheat, what is the law?</p>
<p class="bas indent1"><span class="nm">(g)</span><span class="cl">Answer (Shmuel):</span> He may keep it.</p>
<p class="bas indent1"><span class="nm">(h)</span><span class="cl">Question (Rav Yehudah):</span> If a Yisrael came and gave a Siman, what is the law?</p>
<p class="bas indent1"><span class="nm">(i)</span><span class="cl">Answer (Shmuel):</span> He must return it.</p>
<p class="bas indent1"><span class="nm">(j)</span><span class="cl">Question:</span> That contradicts the previous answer!</p>
<p class="bas indent1"><span class="nm">(k)</span><span class="cl">Answer:</span> He should go beyond the letter of the law and return it.</p>
<p class="bas indent2"><span class="nm">1.</span>Shmuel's father found donkeys in the wilderness; he returned them to the owner after 12 months. This was beyond the letter of the law.</p>
<p class="bas indent1"><span class="nm">(l)</span><span class="cl">Question (Rava):</span> If one found a wallet in the market of shoemakers (some say, Chachamim), what is the law?</p>
<p class="bas indent1"><span class="nm">(m)</span><span class="cl">Answer (Rav Nachman):</span> He may keep it.</p>
<p class="bas indent1"><span class="nm">(n)</span><span class="cl">Question (Rava):</span> If a Yisrael came and gave Simanim, what is the law?</p>
<p class="bas indent1"><span class="nm">(o)</span><span class="cl">Answer (Rav Nachman):</span> The finder keeps it.</p>
<p class="bas indent1"><span class="nm">(p)</span><span class="cl">Question:</span> The loser is screaming that it is his!</p>
<p class="bas indent1"><span class="nm">(q)</span><span class="cl">Answer:</span> He is like one screaming over his house that burned or his ship that sank.</p>
<p class="bas subject"><span class="nm">4)</span>MEAT THAT WAS FOUND</p>
<p class="bas indent1"><span class="nm">(a)</span>A vulture took meat from the market and deposited it among Bar Meryon's date trees. Abaye ruled that he keeps it.</p>
<p class="bas indent1"><span class="nm">(b)</span><span class="cl">Inference:</span> The majority of people in the area are Yisre'elim. This shows that the Halachah follows R. Shimon, even when the majority are Yisrael!</p>
<p class="bas indent1"><span class="nm">(c)</span><span class="cl">Rejection:</span> No, something taken by a vulture is like something taken by a high tide.</p>
<p class="bas indent1"><span class="nm">(d)</span><span class="cl">Question:</span> Rav said that meat that was not watched constantly is forbidden (lest it was switched with  meat of Nochrim)!</p>
<p class="bas indent1"><span class="nm">(e)</span><span class="cl">Answer:</span> The case is, he was watching from when the meat was taken.</p>
<p class="bas indent1"><span class="nm">(f)</span>R. Chanina found a slaughtered kid between Teveriyah and Tzipori.</p>
<p class="bas indent2"><span class="nm">1.</span>Rabanan permitted him to keep it. This ruling was like R. Shimon;</p>
<p class="bas indent2"><span class="nm">2.</span>Rabanan ruled that we assume that the slaughter was Kosher. This ruling was like R. Chananya, the son of R. Yosi ha'Glili.</p>
<p class="bas indent3"><span class="nm">i.</span><span class="cl">(Beraisa - R. Yehudah):</span> If one lost his kids and chickens, and found them slaughtered, they are forbidden;</p>
<p class="bas indent3"><span class="nm">ii.</span>R. Chananyah permits them.</p>
<p class="bas indent3"><span class="nm">iii.</span>Rebbi says, if they were found in the waste heap, the Halachah follows R. Yehudah. If they were found in the house, the Halachah follows R. Chananyah.</p>
<p class="bas indent2"><span class="nm">3.</span>Since the slaughter was permitted, we must say that the city was mostly Yisre'elim, and R. Shimon permits even in this case!</p>
<p class="bas indent2"><span class="nm">4.</span><span class="cl">Rejection (Rava):</span> No. The city was mostly Nochrim. The slaughter was permitted because most of the slaughterers were Yisrael.</p>
<p class="bas indent1"><span class="nm">(g)</span>R. Ami found slaughtered chicks between Teveriyah and Tzipori, and R. Yitzchak Nafcha found threads for twining ropes. R. Yochanan (or Rav Asi or Chachamim in the Beis Medrash) permitted them they were permitted them to keep them.</p>
