<p class="bas subject"><span class="nm">1)</span>CAN A WOMAN EAT <i>TERUMAH</i> IF SHE IS FORBIDDEN TO HER HUSBAND?</p>
<p class="bas indent1"><span class="nm">(a)</span><span class="cl">Question:</span> This is not necessarily true!</p>
<p class="bas indent2"><span class="nm">1.</span>In our Mishnah, R. Elazar and R. Shimon permit her to eat because her husband can permit other women to eat Terumah. Here, her husband (a Petzu'a Daka) cannot permit any woman to eat!</p>
<p class="bas indent2"><span class="nm">2.</span><span class="cl">Suggestion:</span> Also here, he permits a convert's daughter to eat (she may marry a Petzu'a Daka)!</p>
<p class="bas indent2"><span class="nm">3.</span><span class="cl">Rejection:</span> R. Yochanan asked R. Oshaya this (whether or not she may eat), and he never settled it! (Tosfos - the Gemara settles this below. Rashi connotes that R. Oshaya himself never settled it, therefore we cannot use this to defend R. Oshaya.)</p>
<p class="bas indent1"><span class="nm">(b)</span><span class="cl">Answer #1 (Abaye):</span> Here also, a Petzu'a Daka permits his wife to eat, if he married her before becoming a Petzu'a Daka, and did not have Bi'ah with her after becoming a Petzu'a Daka.</p>
<p class="bas indent1"><span class="nm">(c)</span><span class="cl">Answer #2 (Rava):</span> He permits his Kena'ani slaves to eat.</p>
<p class="bas indent1"><span class="nm">(d)</span>Abaye did not answer as Rava, because we learn marriage laws from marriage laws, not from laws of slaves;</p>
<p class="bas indent1"><span class="nm">(e)</span>Rava did not answer like Abaye, for there is different, for she already ate.</p>
<p class="bas indent2"><span class="nm">1.</span>Abaye holds that the fact that she already ate is immaterial.</p>
<p class="bas indent2"><span class="nm">2.</span><span class="cl">Support:</span> If you will not say so, a Bas Yisrael widowed from a Kohen should continue to eat, because she already ate!</p>
<p class="bas indent2"><span class="nm">3.</span><span class="cl">Rejection (Rava):</span> There is different, since his Kinyan lapses when he dies. Here, she is still married to the Petzu'a Daka!</p>
<p class="bas subject"><span class="nm">2)</span>A <i>PETZU'A</i> <i>DAKA</i> MARRIED TO A CONVERT'S DAUGHTER</p>
<p class="bas indent1"><span class="nm">(a)</span><span class="cl">Question (R. Yochanan):</span> If a Bas Ger married a Petzu'a Daka, may she eat Terumah?</p>
<p class="bas indent2"><span class="nm">1.</span>R. Oshaya was silent.</p>
<p class="bas indent1"><span class="nm">(b)</span>Later, another great man came and asked a different matter, and R. Oshaya answered his question.</p>
<p class="bas indent1"><span class="nm">(c)</span><span class="cl">Question:</span> Who was this great man?</p>
<p class="bas indent1"><span class="nm">(d)</span><span class="cl">Answer:</span> It was Reish Lakish.</p>
<p class="bas indent1"><span class="nm">(e)</span><span class="cl">R. Yehudah Nesi'ah:</span> Is R. Yochanan not a great man (why didn't you answer him)?!</p>
<p class="bas indent1"><span class="nm">(f)</span><span class="cl">R. Oshaya:</span> He asked me a question that needs no answer!</p>
<p class="bas indent2"><span class="nm">1.</span>If he asks according to R. Yehudah, even if a Kohen (who became a Petzu'a Daka) loses his Kedushah (special marriage Isurim), she does not eat!</p>
<p class="bas indent3"><span class="nm">i.</span>If he retains his Kedushah, she does not eat, since R. Yehudah says that a male convert's daughter is like a Chalal's daughter, and is forbidden to a Kohen.</p>
<p class="bas indent3"><span class="nm">ii.</span>(And even) if he loses his Kedushah she does not eat, since (R. Yehudah says that) converts are considered Kehal (the congregation of) Hash-m, so she may not marry a Petzu'a Daka.</p>
<p class="bas indent2"><span class="nm">2.</span>If he asks according to R. Yosi, even if he retains his Kedushah, she may eat!</p>
<p class="bas indent3"><span class="nm">i.</span>If he loses his Kedushah she may eat, since R. Yosi holds that converts are not Kehal Hash-m, so she may marry a Petzu'a Daka; (Note- we switched the order of these two lines for clarity. The Gemara's 'first' side (which we put second) also relies on 'Lo Ikri Kehal' for the Heter - see Tosfos DH d'Ha.)</p>
<p class="bas indent3"><span class="nm">ii.</span>(And even) if he retains his Kedushah she may eat, since R. Yosi holds that even the daughter of two converts is permitted to Kehunah.</p>
<p class="bas indent1"><span class="nm">(g)</span>Rather, he asked according to the following Tana:</p>
<p class="bas indent2"><span class="nm">1.</span><span class="cl">(Mishnah - R. Eliezer ben Yakov):</span> A Bas Ger may not marry a Kohen unless her mother is a Bas Yisrael.</p>
<p class="bas indent2"><span class="nm">2.</span>R. Yochanan asked whether being a Bas Yisrael's daughter adds (only) Kashrus (to Kehunah), and therefore she may eat;</p>
<p class="bas indent3"><span class="nm">i.</span>Or, perhaps (also) Kedushah is added (she is called Kehal Hash-m, and is forbidden to a Petzu'a Daka), and she does not eat?</p>
<p class="bas indent1"><span class="nm">(h)</span><span class="cl">Answer (to R. Yochanan's question - R. Acha's Beraisa):</span> We learn that a Bas Ger married to a Petzu'a Daka may eat Terumah from "When a Kohen acquires a person... he will eat";</p>
<p class="bas indent2"><span class="nm">1.</span><span class="cl">Question:</span> Like whom is this Beraisa?</p>
<p class="bas indent3"><span class="nm">i.</span>It is unlike R. Yehudah, who holds that even if the Kohen loses his Kedushah, she does not eat!</p>
<p class="bas indent3"><span class="nm">ii.</span>It is unlike R. Yosi. He holds that even if he retains his Kedushah, she may eat, so we would not need a verse to teach this!</p>
<p class="bas indent2"><span class="nm">2.</span><span class="cl">Answer:</span> It is like R. Eliezer ben Yakov. This shows that Kashrus is added, and she eats.</p>

<p class="bas subject"><span class="nm">3)</span>CHUPAH OF A PESULAH</p>
<p class="bas indent1"><span class="nm">(a)</span><span class="cl">(Rav):</span> Yesh Chupah l'Pesulos (Chupah takes effect even if she is forbidden to him. Rashi - even though Bi'ah is Asur, Chupah makes Kidushin (like Rav Huna, Kidushin 5a). Tosfos - Rav teaches that Chupah after Kidushin disqualifies her, even without Bi'ah.)</p>
<p class="bas indent1"><span class="nm">(b)</span><span class="cl">(Shmuel):</span> Ein Chupah l'Pesulos (it does not take effect).</p>
<p class="bas indent1"><span class="nm">(c)</span><span class="cl">(Shmuel):</span> Rav admits regarding a girl under three years and a day. Since Bi'ah with her is not considered Bi'ah, Chupah does not take effect on her.</p>
<p class="bas indent1"><span class="nm">(d)</span><span class="cl">Support (Rava- Mishnah):</span> The following apply to a girl (at least) three years and one day:</p>
<p class="bas indent2"><span class="nm">1.</span>One can Mekadesh her through Bi'ah;</p>
<p class="bas indent2"><span class="nm">2.</span>She is acquired to her Yavam through Yibum;</p>
<p class="bas indent2"><span class="nm">3.</span>One who has Bi'ah with her is liable for Eshes Ish (if she is married);</p>
<p class="bas indent2"><span class="nm">4.</span>(If she is Nidah,) one who has Bi'ah with her becomes Tamei (due to Bo'el Nidah), and he is Metamei a Mishkav (a Kli made to sit on it) under him (even if he does not touch it) to be (a Rishon l'Tum'ah,) like a Kli above a Zav;</p>
<p class="bas indent2"><span class="nm">5.</span>If she is married to a Kohen, she may eat Terumah;</p>
<p class="bas indent2"><span class="nm">6.</span>If a man has Bi'as Isur with her, he disqualifies her.</p>
<p class="bas indent2"><span class="nm">7.</span><span class="cl">Inference:</span> If she is three years and one day, Bi'ah disqualifies her, so also Chupah does. If she is younger, Bi'ah does not disqualify her, so neither does Chupah.</p>
