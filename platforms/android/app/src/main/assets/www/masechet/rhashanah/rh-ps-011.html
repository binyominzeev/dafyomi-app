<p class="bas indent1"><span class="nm">(a)</span><span class="cl">(R. Eliezer):</span> We know that the world was created in Tishrei as it states that Hash-m ordered the land to be full of grass and the trees to be full of fruit, which happens in Tishrei.</p>
<p class="bas indent2"><span class="nm">1.</span>Additionally, we find that it rained for them, which also happens in Tishrei.</p>
<p class="bas indent1"><span class="nm">(b)</span><span class="cl">(R. Yehoshua):</span> We know that the world was created in Nisan as it states that the land began sprouting grass and the trees began forming fruit, which happens in Nisan.</p>
<p class="bas indent2"><span class="nm">1.</span>Additionally, it must have been the time when animals breed (to populate the world), which happens in Nisan.</p>
<p class="bas indent1"><span class="nm">(c)</span><span class="cl">Question:</span> How does R. Eliezer account for the Pasuk stating that the trees were forming fruit (but they weren't fully formed)?</p>
<p class="bas indent1"><span class="nm">(d)</span><span class="cl">Answer:</span> That is a blessing for the trees to form fruit for future generations.</p>
<p class="bas indent1"><span class="nm">(e)</span><span class="cl">Question:</span> How does R. Yehoshua account for the Pasuk stating that the trees bore fully formed fruit?</p>
<p class="bas indent1"><span class="nm">(f)</span><span class="cl">Answer:</span> It follows the view of R. Yehoshua ben Levi that everything in the process of Creation was made fully formed, with their consent, and in their desired form, as derived from a Pasuk.</p>
<p class="bas subject"><span class="nm">2)</span>THE BIRTH OF THE FOREFATHERS</p>
<p class="bas indent1"><span class="nm">(a)</span><span class="cl">(R. Eliezer):</span> We know that the forefathers were born in Tishrei as a Pasuk refers to Tishrei as "month of the Eisanim."</p>
<p class="bas indent2"><span class="nm">1.</span>This means the month in which the mighty ones (the forefathers) were born.</p>
<p class="bas indent2"><span class="nm">2.</span>We have a Pasuk which shows us that Eisan means "mighty."</p>
<p class="bas indent2"><span class="nm">3.</span>We also have a Pasuk which calls the Eisanim "mountains," and we know from another Pasuk that the forefathers are referred to as mountains.</p>
<p class="bas indent1"><span class="nm">(b)</span><span class="cl">(R. Yehoshua):</span> We know that the forefathers were born in Nisan as a Pasuk refers to Iyar as Chodesh Ziv.</p>
<p class="bas indent2"><span class="nm">1.</span>This means the month with which upon its onset (Chadash) the splendor (Ziv) of the world (the forefathers) were already born (in the previous month Nisan).</p>
<p class="bas indent1"><span class="nm">(c)</span><span class="cl">Question:</span> How does R. Yehoshua account for the Pasuk calling Tishrei the "month of the mighty"?</p>
<p class="bas indent1"><span class="nm">(d)</span><span class="cl">Answer:</span> It means the month which is mighty with many mitzvos.</p>
<p class="bas indent1"><span class="nm">(e)</span><span class="cl">Question:</span> How does R. Eliezer account for the Pasuk of "the month of splendor"?</p>
<p class="bas indent1"><span class="nm">(f)</span><span class="cl">Answer:</span> It refers to the splendor of the trees.</p>
<p class="bas indent2"><span class="nm">1.</span><span class="cl">(R. Yehudah):</span> One who goes out in Nisan and sees trees in bloom must bless Hash-m for them.</p>
<p class="bas indent1"><span class="nm">(g)</span>According to the opinion that they were born in Nisan, they also died in Nisan; according to the opinion that they were born in Tishrei, they also died in Tishrei.</p>
<p class="bas indent2"><span class="nm">1.</span>This is learned from Moshe describing himself as "120 years old today."</p>
<p class="bas indent3"><span class="nm">i.</span>"Today" teaches that his years were full to the day.</p>
<p class="bas indent3"><span class="nm">ii.</span>Hash-m ensures that the years of all righteous people are full to the day.</p>
<p class="bas subject"><span class="nm">3)</span>THE BIRTH OF YITZCHAK</p>
<p class="bas indent1"><span class="nm">(a)</span><span class="cl">Question:</span> How do we know that Yitzchak was born on Pesach?</p>
<p class="bas indent1"><span class="nm">(b)</span><span class="cl">Answer:</span> The angel who forecasted his birth said that he would return for it on the following festival.</p>
<p class="bas indent2"><span class="nm">1.</span><span class="cl">Question:</span> On which festival did this happen?</p>
<p class="bas indent3"><span class="nm">i.</span>It couldn't have been Pesach, with him referring to Shavuos, as fifty days is not long enough to conceive and give birth.</p>
<p class="bas indent3"><span class="nm">ii.</span>It couldn't have been Shavuos, with him referring to Sukos, as five months is not long enough to conceive and give birth.</p>
<p class="bas indent3"><span class="nm">iii.</span>It couldn't have been Sukos, with him referring to Pesach, as six months is still not long enough to conceive and give birth.</p>
<p class="bas indent2"><span class="nm">2.</span><span class="cl">Answer:</span> He was referring to Pesach, and it was a leap year (so there were seven months).</p>
<p class="bas indent3"><span class="nm">i.</span><span class="cl">Question:</span> But since we know that Sarah was a Nidah at the time, it could only have been less than seven months!</p>
<p class="bas indent3"><span class="nm">ii.</span><span class="cl">Answer (Mar Zutra):</span> Even according to the opinion that a nine-month pregnancy cannot be abbreviated, a seven-month pregnancy can be abbreviated.</p>
<p class="bas indent3"><span class="nm">iii.</span>This is evident from that fact that Chanah gave birth after "Tekufas ha'Yamim" (the plural form of both words) which means six months (two Tekufos) and two days (Yamim).</p>

<p class="bas indent1"><span class="nm">(b)</span><span class="cl">(R. Yehoshua):</span> It was the seventeenth of Iyar, when the Kima constellation sets by day and the springs recede.</p>

<p class="bas indent2"><span class="nm">2.</span>He made Kima rise by day, removed two stars from it, and thereby brought on a flood.</p>
