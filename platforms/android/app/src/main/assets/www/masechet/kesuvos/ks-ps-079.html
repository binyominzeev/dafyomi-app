<p class="bas subject"><span class="nm">1)</span>A DOCUMENT TO DIVERT PROPERTY</p>
<p class="bas indent1"><span class="nm">(a)</span>A woman about to have Nisu'in wanted to divert her property from her husband. She wrote a document giving her property to her daughter, had Nisu'in, and was divorced.</p>
<p class="bas indent1"><span class="nm">(b)</span>The document came in front of Rav Nachman; he tore it up.</p>
<p class="bas indent1"><span class="nm">(c)</span>Rav Anan (to Mar Ukva, the Av Beis Din). Nachman the farmer (i.e. he is not proficient in monetary laws) tears up people's documents!</p>
<p class="bas indent1"><span class="nm">(d)</span><span class="cl">Mar Ukva (after hearing the entire story):</span> You discuss a document to divert? Shmuel said that he would tear up such a document! (Rav Nachman acted correctly.)</p>
<p class="bas indent1"><span class="nm">(e)</span><span class="cl">Question (Rava, to Rav Nachman):</span> Did you tear it up because a person would not abandon himself and give his money to others? That applies to others, but one does give to his daughter!</p>
<p class="bas indent1"><span class="nm">(f)</span><span class="cl">Answer (Rav Nachman):</span> Even so, a person takes precedence over his daughter.</p>
<p class="bas indent1"><span class="nm">(g)</span><span class="cl">Question (Beraisa - R. Shimon ben Gamliel):</span> If one wants to divert property from her husband, she writes to someone else a document of Pasim (she appeases the recipient to accept the property to divert it from her husband);</p>
<p class="bas indent2"><span class="nm">1.</span>Chachamim say, the recipient can keep the property and laugh at her, unless she wrote 'From today until when I want'.</p>
<p class="bas indent2"><span class="nm">2.</span><span class="cl">Summation of question:</span> If she did not write this, the document is valid!</p>
<p class="bas indent1"><span class="nm">(h)</span><span class="cl">Answer (R. Zeira):</span> If the document gives all her property, it is invalid even if this was not written. If it gives part of her property, it is valid unless the clause was written.</p>
<p class="bas indent1"><span class="nm">(i)</span><span class="cl">Question:</span> If the receiver does not get the property, the husband should get it!</p>
<p class="bas indent1"><span class="nm">(j)</span><span class="cl">Answer (Abaye):</span> It is considered like property unknown to the husband. This is like R. Shimon.</p>
<p class="bas subject"><span class="nm">2)</span>WHICH PROFITS DOES THE HUSBAND RECEIVE?</p>
<p class="bas indent1"><span class="nm">(a)</span><span class="cl">(Mishnah):</span> If a wife inherited money, the husband buys land with it and eats the Peiros. The same applies if she inherited Peiros detached from the ground;</p>
<p class="bas indent1"><span class="nm">(b)</span>R. Meir says, if she inherited attached Peiros, we evaluate how much the Peiros add to the value of the land. The husband buys land (for her) for this amount, and he eats the Peiros;</p>
<p class="bas indent1"><span class="nm">(c)</span>Chachamim say, attached Peiros are his. Detached Peiros are hers, and he buys land with them and eats the Peiros;</p>
<p class="bas indent1"><span class="nm">(d)</span>R. Shimon says, at the end of the marriage the husband has less rights in the matter in which he had more rights at the start of the marriage. He has more rights (at the end) in the matter in which he had less rights at the start;</p>
<p class="bas indent2"><span class="nm">1.</span>At the start of the marriage he gets attached Peiros; at the end of the marriage, they are hers. At the start, detached Peiros are hers; at the end, they are his.</p>
<p class="bas indent1"><span class="nm">(e)</span><span class="cl">(Gemara):</span> (When he and she disagree about how to invest the money,) clearly the preferred investment for the money is land, followed by houses (they are second best), followed by date trees, followed by other trees, followed by vines.</p>
<p class="bas indent1"><span class="nm">(f)</span>Some say that a forest of trees (that do not bear considerable fruit, but are cut for lumber) and a pond of fish are considered like Peiros (and the wood and fish belong to the husband);</p>
<p class="bas indent2"><span class="nm">1.</span>Others say that they are like principal (the husband buys land with them and eats the Peiros, but the land is his wife's).</p>
<p class="bas indent2"><span class="nm">2.</span>The rule is, things that grow back are Peiros. Things that do not grow back are principal.</p>
<p class="bas bbbline">79b----------------------------------------79b</p>
<p class="bas indent1"><span class="nm">(g)</span><span class="cl">(R. Zeira):</span> (If a thief is convicted for stealing, he pays twice the value of what he stole.) If the child of a Melug animal was stolen, the extra payment goes to the wife.</p>
<p class="bas indent1"><span class="nm">(h)</span><span class="cl">Question:</span> This is not like Chachamim, nor like Chananyah!</p>
<p class="bas indent2"><span class="nm">1.</span><span class="cl">(Beraisa):</span> The child of a Melug animal belongs to the husband; the child of a Melug slave belongs to the wife;</p>
<p class="bas indent2"><span class="nm">2.</span>Chananyah ben Achi Yoshiyah says, mid'Rabanan the child of a Melug slave is like the child of a Melug animal.</p>
<p class="bas indent1"><span class="nm">(i)</span><span class="cl">Answer:</span> R. Zeira's law can be according to both opinions.</p>
<p class="bas indent2"><span class="nm">1.</span>It was enacted only that the husband eats Peiros (of principal); but not Peiros of Peiros (such like the extra payment for the child of the Melug animal).</p>
<p class="bas indent1"><span class="nm">(j)</span><span class="cl">Question:</span> We understand Chananyah. He is not concerned for death (of the mother animal or slave, so the children are like Peiros that grow back). But how do Chachamim hold?</p>
<p class="bas indent2"><span class="nm">1.</span>If they are concerned for death, even the child of an animal should be considered principal. If they are not concerned for death, even the child of a slave should be Peiros!</p>
<p class="bas indent1"><span class="nm">(k)</span><span class="cl">Answer:</span> They are concerned for death. However, when an animal dies, there is still the hide. The principal is not entirely consumed.</p>
<p class="bas indent1"><span class="nm">(l)</span><span class="cl">(Rav Huna):</span> The Halachah follows Chananyah.</p>
<p class="bas indent1"><span class="nm">(m)</span><span class="cl">(Rava):</span> Chananyah admits that if she is divorced, she may pay the value of the slaves' children and keep them, for this is the honor of her father's house.</p>
<p class="bas indent1"><span class="nm">(n)</span><span class="cl">(Rava):</span> If she brought in a goat for milk, a sheep for shearings, a hen for eggs, or a date tree for dates, the husband consumes them until the principal is finished.</p>
<p class="bas indent1"><span class="nm">(o)</span><span class="cl">(Rav Nachman):</span> If she brought in a cloak, he may wear it until it wears out, since it is considered like Peiros.</p>
<p class="bas indent1"><span class="nm">(p)</span>This is like Chachamim in the following Beraisa (who say that any usage in which even a small remnant remains is considered Peiros):</p>
<p class="bas indent2"><span class="nm">1.</span><span class="cl">(Beraisa):</span> Salt and sand are considered Peiros;</p>
<p class="bas indent2"><span class="nm">2.</span>R. Meir says, a reserve of sulfur or alum is considered principal;</p>
<p class="bas indent2"><span class="nm">3.</span>Chachamim say, it is like Peiros.</p>
<p class="bas indent1"><span class="nm">(q)</span><span class="cl">(Mishnah - R. Shimon):</span> The place where the husband has more rights...</p>
<p class="bas indent1"><span class="nm">(r)</span><span class="cl">Question:</span> The previous Tana (Chachamim) also says so!</p>
<p class="bas indent1"><span class="nm">(s)</span><span class="cl">Answer (Rava):</span> They argue about attached Peiros when she leaves. (Chachamim say that they are his; R. Shimon says that they are hers.)</p>
<p class="bas subject"><span class="nm">3)</span>HONOR OF HER FATHER'S HOUSE</p>
<p class="bas indent1"><span class="nm">(a)</span><span class="cl">(Mishnah):</span> If she inherited old slaves, they are sold. He buys land with the money and eats the Peiros;</p>
<p class="bas indent1"><span class="nm">(b)</span>R. Shimon ben Gamliel says, they are not sold (if she protests), because they are the honor of her father's house.</p>
<p class="bas indent1"><span class="nm">(c)</span>If she inherited old olive trees and vines, they are sold. He buys land with the money and eats the Peiros;</p>
<p class="bas indent1"><span class="nm">(d)</span>R. Yehudah says, they are not sold, because they are the honor of her father's house.</p>
<p class="bas indent1"><span class="nm">(e)</span><span class="cl">(Gemara - Rav Kahana):</span> They argue about trees in her field. If they are in another person's field all agree that they are sold, because the principal will be consumed.</p>
<p class="bas indent1"><span class="nm">(f)</span><span class="cl">Objection (Rav Yosef):</span> Slaves are like trees in another's field (there is no remnant if they die), and Tana'im argue about them in our Mishnah!</p>
<p class="bas indent1"><span class="nm">(g)</span><span class="cl">Correction (Rav Kahana):</span> Rather, they argue about trees in another's field. If they are in her field all agree that they are not sold, due to the honor of her father's house.</p>
<p class="bas subject"><span class="nm">4)</span>THE HUSBAND'S EXPENDITURES ON HIS WIFE'S PROPERTY</p>
<p class="bas indent1"><span class="nm">(a)</span><span class="cl">(Mishnah):</span> If a husband spent money to upkeep his wife's property, whether he spent much and ate little, or spent little and ate much, there is no compensation;</p>
<p class="bas indent1"><span class="nm">(b)</span>If he spent and did not eat, he swears how much he spent and receives this.</p>
<p class="bas indent1"><span class="nm">(c)</span><span class="cl">(Gemara) Question:</span> How much is considered (eating) little?</p>
<p class="bas indent1"><span class="nm">(d)</span><span class="cl">Answer #1 (R. Asi):</span> It is even one dried fig, if he ate it honorably.</p>
