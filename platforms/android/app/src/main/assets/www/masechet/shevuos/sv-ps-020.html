<p class="bas subject"><span class="nm">1)</span>ONE WHO SAID 'SHE'OCHEL'</p>
<p class="bas indent1"><span class="nm">(a)</span><span class="cl">Answer #1 (Abaye):</span> In our Mishnah, he was not being pressured to eat, so 'she'Ochel' means 'I will eat.'</p>
<p class="bas indent2"><span class="nm">1.</span>In the Beraisa (Tosfos - other Mishnah), he was being pressured to eat, and kept refusing;</p>
<p class="bas indent2"><span class="nm">2.</span>When he finally swore 'she'Ochel', he meant 'I will not eat' (so they will stop insisting).</p>
<p class="bas indent1"><span class="nm">(b)</span><span class="cl">Answer #2 (Rav Ashi):</span> The text (there) should read 'she'Iy Ochel' (that I will not eat).</p>
<p class="bas indent1"><span class="nm">(c)</span><span class="cl">Question:</span> The Tana already taught 'she'Lo Ochel.' Why must he teach also 'she'Iy Ochel'?</p>
<p class="bas indent1"><span class="nm">(d)</span><span class="cl">Answer:</span> One might have thought that he meant to say 'she'Ochel', and mispronounced it. The Tana teaches that this is not so.</p>
<p class="bas subject"><span class="nm">2)</span>WHAT IS ISAR?</p>
<p class="bas indent1"><span class="nm">(a)</span><span class="cl">(Beraisa):</span> "Mivta" is a Shevu'ah. "Isar" is a Shevu'ah;</p>
<p class="bas indent1"><span class="nm">(b)</span>The prohibition of Isar - if you will say that Isar is a Shevu'ah, he is liable. If not, he is exempt.</p>
<p class="bas indent1"><span class="nm">(c)</span><span class="cl">Objection:</span> The Tana just said that Isar is a Shevu'ah!</p>
<p class="bas indent1"><span class="nm">(d)</span><span class="cl">Answer #1 (Abaye):</span> The Beraisa means: if one says "Mivta", this is a Shevu'ah. If he says "Isar", this is Hatfasah in a Shevu'ah (forbidding something like something else forbidden by a Shevu'ah);</p>
<p class="bas indent2"><span class="nm">1.</span><span class="cl">Version #1 (Rashi):</span> The prohibition of Isar: if you will say that Hatfasah in a Shevu'ah is like saying a Shevu'ah, he is liable (if he transgresses it). If not, he is exempt.</p>
<p class="bas indent2"><span class="nm">2.</span><span class="cl">Version #2A (Tosfos):</span> The prohibition of Isar: if he was Matfis in a Shevu'ah, he is like one who said a Shevu'ah, and he is liable. If he said 'this is Isar upon me', this is not a Shevu'ah, and he is exempt.</p>
<p class="bas indent2"><span class="nm">3.</span><span class="cl">Version #2B:</span> The prohibition of Isar: if he used the text of a Shevu'ah to be Matfis (e.g. I will not eat this, like this (other food forbidden by a Shevu'ah)), he is like one who said a Shevu'ah, and he is liable. If he did not say the text of a Shevu'ah (he said only 'this is like this'), this is not a Shevu'ah, and he is exempt.</p>
<p class="bas indent2"><span class="nm">4.</span><span class="cl">Version #2C:</span> If one was Matfis item A in a Shevu'ah, and one was Matfis B in A, one is liable for B only if Hatfasah in a Shevu'ah is exactly like saying a Shevu'ah, for then this is like normal Hatfasah in a Shevu'ah. . If not, he is exempt. (end of Version #2)</p>
<p class="bas indent1"><span class="nm">(e)</span><span class="cl">Question:</span> What is the source that "Mivta" is a Shevu'ah?</p>
<p class="bas indent1"><span class="nm">(f)</span><span class="cl">Answer #1:</span> We learn from "... Ki Sishava LeVaTei."</p>
<p class="bas indent1"><span class="nm">(g)</span><span class="cl">Question:</span> We should say the same about Isar - "V'Chol Shevu'as Isar"!</p>
<p class="bas indent1"><span class="nm">(h)</span><span class="cl">Answer:</span> We must say that we learn that "Isar" is Hatfasah in a Shevu'ah from "... Isar Al Nafshah bi'Shvu'ah."</p>
<p class="bas indent1"><span class="nm">(i)</span><span class="cl">Question:</span> We should say the same about Mivta, for it says "Asher YeVaTei ha'Adam bi'Shevu'ah"!</p>
<p class="bas indent1"><span class="nm">(j)</span><span class="cl">Answer #2 (Abaye):</span> No, we learn that "Mivta" is a Shevu'ah from "... u'Nedareha Aleha Oh Mivta...";</p>
<p class="bas indent2"><span class="nm">1.</span>The verse does not mention a Shevu'ah. We must say that she forbade herself through Mivta alone!</p>
<p class="bas indent1"><span class="nm">(k)</span><span class="cl">Answer #2 (to Objection c - Rava):</span> Really, Hatfasah in a Shevu'ah is not like saying a Shevu'ah;</p>
<p class="bas indent2"><span class="nm">1.</span>The Beraisa means as follows. "Mivta" is a Shevu'ah. Also "Isar" is a Shevu'ah;</p>
<p class="bas indent2"><span class="nm">2.</span>Isar is not always a Shevu'ah. The Torah wrote it between Neder and Shevu'ah to teach that it can be either;</p>
<p class="bas indent2"><span class="nm">3.</span>If it was said in the text of a Shevu'ah (forbidding an action), it is a Shevu'ah. If it was said in the text of a Neder (Alai, forbidding an object to himself), it is a Neder.</p>
<p class="bas indent1"><span class="nm">(l)</span><span class="cl">Question:</span> Where did the Torah wrote Isar between Neder and Shevu'ah?</p>
<p class="bas indent1"><span class="nm">(m)</span><span class="cl">Answer:</span> It says "V'Im Beis Ishah Nadarah Oh Asrah Isar Al Nafshah bi'Shevu'ah."</p>
<p class="bas indent1"><span class="nm">(n)</span>Abaye and Rava explain according to what they taught elsewhere:</p>
<p class="bas indent2"><span class="nm">1.</span><span class="cl">(Abaye):</span> Hatfasah in a Shevu'ah is like saying a Shevu'ah;</p>
<p class="bas indent2"><span class="nm">2.</span><span class="cl">(Rava):</span> It is not like saying a Shevu'ah.</p>
<p class="bas indent1"><span class="nm">(o)</span><span class="cl">Question (against Rava - Beraisa):</span> Examples of the Isar that the Torah discusses are 'eating meat and drinking wine are forbidden to me like the day that my father died... or the day Gedalyah ben Achikam was killed, the day that I saw Yerushalayim in ruins... ' He is forbidden.</p>
<p class="bas indent2"><span class="nm">1.</span><span class="cl">(Shmuel):</span> The case is, he had already taken a Neder never to eat meat or drink wine on that day.</p>
<p class="bas indent2"><span class="nm">2.</span>This is not difficult for Abaye. The Beraisa explains Hatfasah in a Neder, for this takes effect just like (Tosfos - and is learned from) Hatfasah in a Shevu'ah.</p>
<p class="bas bbbline">20b----------------------------------------20b</p>
<p class="bas indent2"><span class="nm">3.</span>This refutes Rava (who says that Isar is not through Hatfasah)!</p>
<p class="bas indent1"><span class="nm">(p)</span><span class="cl">Answer:</span> The Beraisa means that the <i>Neder</i> that the Torah discusses is 'eating meat and drinking wine are forbidden to me like the day that my father died... ' He is forbidden.</p>
<p class="bas indent2"><span class="nm">1.</span><span class="cl">(Shmuel):</span> The case is, he had already taken a Neder never to eat meat... on that day.</p>
<p class="bas indent2"><span class="nm">2.</span><span class="cl">Question:</span> Why must that be the case?</p>
<p class="bas indent2"><span class="nm">3.</span><span class="cl">Answer:</span> "Ish Ki Yidor Neder la'Shem" - Hatfasah must be in Davar ha'Nadur (something forbidden by a vow).</p>
<p class="bas indent2"><span class="nm">4.</span><span class="cl">Question:</span> If so, what is special about the day that his father died?</p>
<p class="bas indent2"><span class="nm">5.</span><span class="cl">Answer:</span> Indeed, there is nothing special about it. The Chidush is the day that Gedalyah died;</p>
<p class="bas indent3"><span class="nm">i.</span>One might have thought that since he is forbidden to eat that day (Tzom Gedalyah) even without his Neder, it is like Hatfasah in a forbidden matter, and not in Davar ha'Nadur. The Beraisa teaches that this is not so.</p>
<p class="bas indent1"><span class="nm">(q)</span>Also R. Yochanan holds like Rava.</p>
<p class="bas indent2"><span class="nm">1.</span><span class="cl">(Ravin citing R. Yochanan):</span> 'Mivta I will not eat your food' is a Shevu'ah. 'Isar I will not eat your food' is a Shevu'ah.</p>
<p class="bas subject"><span class="nm">3)</span>FALSE AND VAIN OATHS</p>
<p class="bas indent1"><span class="nm">(a)</span><span class="cl">(Rav Dimi citing R. Yochanan):</span> If one swore 'I will eat' or 'I will not eat' (and transgressed), this is Shevu'as Sheker (a false oath). "V'Lo Sishav'u bi'Shmi la'Shaker" forbids it.</p>
<p class="bas indent2"><span class="nm">1.</span>If one falsely swore 'I ate' or 'I did not eat', this is Shevu'as Shav (a vain oath). "Lo Sisa... la'Shav" forbids it.</p>
<p class="bas indent2"><span class="nm">2.</span>If one transgresses Konamos (Nedarim), he transgresses "Lo Yachel Devaro."</p>
<p class="bas indent1"><span class="nm">(b)</span><span class="cl">Question (Beraisa):</span> Shav and Sheker are the same.</p>
<p class="bas indent2"><span class="nm">1.</span><span class="cl">Suggestion:</span> This means that just like Shav is in the past (i.e. it is false the moment he says it), also Sheker;</p>
<p class="bas indent2"><span class="nm">2.</span>This says that 'I ate' is Sheker! (People might believe it. Shav is something obviously false.)</p>
<p class="bas indent1"><span class="nm">(c)</span><span class="cl">Answer:</span> No, they are different (Shav is in the past, and Sheker depends on the future).</p>
<p class="bas indent1"><span class="nm">(d)</span><span class="cl">Question:</span> The Beraisa says that they are the same!</p>
<p class="bas indent1"><span class="nm">(e)</span><span class="cl">Answer:</span> It means that they were both taught in one (of the Ten) Utterances.</p>
<p class="bas indent2"><span class="nm">1.</span><span class="cl">(Beraisa):</span> "Zachor (mention Shabbos, i.e. in Kidush)" and "Shamor (guard Shabbos, i.e. don't do Melachah)" were said simultaneously, something that only Hash-m could do.</p>
<p class="bas indent1"><span class="nm">(f)</span><span class="cl">Question:</span> There, we learn from the fact that they were said together;</p>
<p class="bas indent2"><span class="nm">1.</span><span class="cl">(Rav Ada bar Ahavah):</span> Mid'Oraisa, women are commanded in Kidush of Shabbos (even though they are usually exempt from positive Mitzvos that apply only at particular times);</p>
<p class="bas indent3"><span class="nm">i.</span>We are commanded "Zachor" and "Shamor" - whoever is commanded to guard, must also mention;</p>
<p class="bas indent3"><span class="nm">ii.</span>Since women are commanded Lishmor (a Lav), they are commanded Lizkor.</p>
<p class="bas indent2"><span class="nm">2.</span><span class="cl">Summation of question:</span> Here, what do we learn from the fact that they were taught in the same Utterance?</p>
<p class="bas indent1"><span class="nm">(g)</span><span class="cl">Answer #1:</span> Just like one is lashed for Shav, also for Sheker.</p>
<p class="bas indent1"><span class="nm">(h)</span><span class="cl">Objection:</span> Just the contrary (it is more obvious that one is lashed for (some oaths of) Sheker, which one transgresses through an action)!</p>
<p class="bas indent1"><span class="nm">(i)</span><span class="cl">Answer #2:</span> Rather, just like one is lashed for Sheker, also for Shav.</p>
<p class="bas indent1"><span class="nm">(j)</span><span class="cl">Question:</span> This is obvious. Both are Lavim!</p>
<p class="bas indent1"><span class="nm">(k)</span><span class="cl">Answer #1:</span> One might have thought (like Rav Papa) that one is not lashed for Shav.</p>
<p class="bas indent2"><span class="nm">1.</span><span class="cl">(Rav Papa):</span> "Lo Yenakeh" teaches that this sin will not be cleansed (by lashes or other punishments)!</p>
<p class="bas indent2"><span class="nm">2.</span>The Beraisa teaches that this is not so (like Abaye answered Rav Papa. Hash-m does not cleanse, but Beis Din lashes to cleanse it.)</p>
