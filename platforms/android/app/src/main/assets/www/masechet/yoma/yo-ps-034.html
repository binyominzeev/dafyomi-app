<div class="subject"><span class="nm">1)</span><p>JUSTIFYING ABAYE'S ORDER OF THE AVODAH (cont'd)</p></div>
<div class="indent1"><span class="nm">(a)</span><p>That the Minchah precedes the Chavitin is based on the Pasuk where Olah and Minchah are in uninterrupted succession.</p></div>
<div class="indent1"><span class="nm">(b)</span><p>That the Chavitin precede the Nesachim of wine is owing to the fact that Chavitin also are considered a Minchah.</p></div>
<div class="indent1"><span class="nm">(c)</span><p>That the Nesachim precede the Musafin is owing to the uninterrupted proximity of Zevach and Nesachin.</p></div>
<div class="indent1"><span class="nm">(d)</span><p>The Musafin precede the Bazichin.</p></div>
<div class="indent2"><span class="nm">1.</span><p><span class="cl">Question:</span> But the Beraisa teaches the opposite order?</p></div>
<div class="indent2"><span class="nm">2.</span><p><span class="cl">Answer:</span> It is a Machlokes Tana'im.</p></div>
<div class="indent2"><span class="nm">3.</span><p>Abaye defends his order because of the repetition of "ba'Yom" (implying delay) by the Bazichin.</p></div>
<div class="indent2"><span class="nm">4.</span><p><span class="cl">Question:</span> What is the rationale for the opposite order?</p></div>
<div class="indent2"><span class="nm">5.</span><p><span class="cl">Answer:</span> Gezeirah Shavah from Chavitin (just as it precedes the Musafin, so, too...).</p></div>
<div class="indent2"><span class="nm">6.</span><p><span class="cl">Question:</span> Then learn from there that the Bazichin should precede the Nesachim, as well!?</p></div>
<div class="indent2"><span class="nm">7.</span><p><span class="cl">Answer:</span> That delay is the role of "ba'Yom".</p></div>
<div class="subject"><span class="nm">2)</span><p>KETORES BETWEEN THE DAM TAMID AND ITS EIVARIM</p></div>
<div class="indent1"><span class="nm">(a)</span><p><span class="cl">Question:</span> This statement of the Mishnah does not concur with either Rabanan or Aba Shaul.</p></div>
<div class="indent2"><span class="nm">1.</span><p>The Rabanan would have the Mishnah read between the Dam and the Neiros.</p></div>
<div class="indent2"><span class="nm">2.</span><p>Aba Shaul would have the Mishnah read between the Neiros and the Eivarim.</p></div>
<div class="indent1"><span class="nm">(b)</span><p><span class="cl">Answer:</span> It is the Rabanan and the Mishnah is not being precise regarding order.</p></div>
<div class="subject"><span class="nm">3)</span><p>KETORES BEIN HA'ARBAYIM</p></div>
<div class="indent1"><span class="nm">(a)</span><p><span class="cl">Question:</span> What is the source for placing the Ketores between the Eivarim and the Nesachim?</p></div>
<div class="indent1"><span class="nm">(b)</span><p><span class="cl">Answer:</span> The Pasuk compares the Bein ha'Arbayim to Shacharis, where the Ketores precedes the Nesachim.</p></div>
<div class="indent1"><span class="nm">(c)</span><p><span class="cl">Question:</span> If this comparison is made, then the Ketores Bein ha'Arbayim should precede its Eivarim!?</p></div>
<div class="indent1"><span class="nm">(d)</span><p><span class="cl">Answer:</span> The comparison is made by Minchah, not Eivarim.</p></div>
<div class="subject"><span class="nm">4)</span><p>NESACHIM FOR THE TAMID OF SHACHARIS</p></div>
<div class="indent1"><span class="nm">(a)</span><p><span class="cl">(Tana Kama of the Beraisa):</span> The Tamid of Shacharis should be derived from the later Tamid and also have Nesachim!?</p></div>
<div class="bbbline">34b----------------------------------------34b</p></div>
<div class="indent1"><span class="nm">(b)</span><p><span class="cl">(Rebbi):</span> Let the Nesachim of Arvis be derived from Shacharis!</p></div>
<div class="indent1"><span class="nm">(c)</span><p><span class="cl">Question:</span> While the Rabanan are understandable (the Pasuk of Nesachim is speaking by the later Tamid), what is the rationale of R. Yehudah?</p></div>
<div class="indent1"><span class="nm">(d)</span><p><span class="cl">Answer:</span> The word "Echad" by Nesachim points us to the Tamid of Shacharis.</p></div>
<div class="indent1"><span class="nm">(e)</span><p><span class="cl">Question:</span> How will Rabanan interpret the pointer of "Echad"?</p></div>
<div class="indent1"><span class="nm">(f)</span><p><span class="cl">Answer:</span> It means the finest of his flock.</p></div>
<div class="indent1"><span class="nm">(g)</span><p><span class="cl">Question:</span> How will Rebbi learn this requirement?</p></div>
<div class="indent1"><span class="nm">(h)</span><p><span class="cl">Answer:</span> From the explicit Pasuk, "Mivchar Nidreichem".</p></div>
<div class="indent1"><span class="nm">(i)</span><p><span class="cl">Question:</span> Why, according to Rabanan, are there two Pesukim?</p></div>
<div class="indent1"><span class="nm">(j)</span><p><span class="cl">Answer:</span> One speaks of Chovos and one of Nedavos, and both are needed.</p></div>
<div class="subject"><span class="nm">5)</span><p>WARMING THE WATER FOR THE SENSITIVE KOHEN</p></div>
<div class="indent1"><span class="nm">(a)</span><p>The Beraisa teaches that thick pieces of metal were warmed before Yom Kipur for this purpose.</p></div>
<div class="indent1"><span class="nm">(b)</span><p><span class="cl">Question:</span> But that constitutes Metzaref on the metal?</p></div>
<div class="indent1"><span class="nm">(c)</span><p><span class="cl">Answer (R. Bibi):</span> They did not reach the heat of Tziruf.</p></div>
<div class="indent1"><span class="nm">(d)</span><p><span class="cl">Answer (Abaye):</span> It is a Davar she'Ein Miskaven and is Mutar.</p></div>
<div class="indent1"><span class="nm">(e)</span><p><span class="cl">Question:</span> But we see in the Beraisa regarding removing a Baheres (through performing a B'ris Milah) that Abaye holds that a Davar she'Ein Miskaven is Asur!?</p></div>
<div class="indent1"><span class="nm">(f)</span><p><span class="cl">Answer:</span> That holds in general, but here, since the prohibition is de'Rabanan, the Chachamim permitted it.</p></div>
