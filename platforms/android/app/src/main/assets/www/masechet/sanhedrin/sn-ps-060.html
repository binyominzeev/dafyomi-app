<p class="bas subject"><span class="nm">1)</span>OTHER MITZVOS OF BENEI NOACH</p>
<p class="bas indent1"><span class="nm">(a)</span><span class="cl">(Beraisa - R. Shimon):</span> A Nochri is also commanded about Kishuf.</p>
<p class="bas indent1"><span class="nm">(b)</span><span class="cl">Question:</span> What is his reason?</p>
<p class="bas indent1"><span class="nm">(c)</span><span class="cl">Answer:</span> It says "Mechashefah Lo Sechayeh", and it says "Kol Shochev Im Behemah Mos Yumas";</p>
<p class="bas indent2"><span class="nm">1.</span>Whoever is commanded about bestiality is commanded about Kishuf.</p>
<p class="bas indent1"><span class="nm">(d)</span><span class="cl">(Beraisa - R. Eliezer):</span> A Nochri is commanded also about Kilayim.</p>
<p class="bas indent1"><span class="nm">(e)</span><span class="cl">Question:</span> What is the source of this?</p>
<p class="bas indent1"><span class="nm">(f)</span><span class="cl">Answer (Shmuel):</span> "Es Chukosai Tishmoru" - statutes that I previously commanded (i.e. to Bnei Noach), "Behemtecha Lo Sarbi'a Kil'ayim Sadcha Lo Sizra Kil'ayim";</p>
<p class="bas indent2"><span class="nm">1.</span>Just like the Isur regarding animals is crossbreeding, the Isur in the field (for Bnei Noach) is grafting diverse trees;</p>
<p class="bas indent2"><span class="nm">2.</span>Just like crossbreeding animals is forbidden in and outside of Eretz Yisrael (since it does not pertain to the land), also grafting.</p>
<p class="bas indent1"><span class="nm">(g)</span><span class="cl">Question:</span> If so, we should likewise expound "u'Shmartem Es Chukosai" (which refers to the entire Torah), statutes that I previously commanded!</p>
<p class="bas indent1"><span class="nm">(h)</span><span class="cl">Answer:</span> There it says "u'Shmartem Es Chukosai", that I now command;</p>
<p class="bas indent2"><span class="nm">1.</span>Here it says "Es Chukosai Tishmoru", which connotes pre-existing statutes (Chukosai precedes Tishmoru).</p>
<p class="bas subject"><span class="nm">2)</span>FOR WHICH NAMES IS ONE LIABLE?</p>
<p class="bas indent1"><span class="nm">(a)</span><span class="cl">(Mishnah - R. Yehoshua ben Korchah):</span> (During the trial...)</p>
<p class="bas indent1"><span class="nm">(b)</span><span class="cl">Version #1 (Rav Acha bar Yakov):</span> He is not liable unless he curses Hash-m's four-letter name, i.e. he is exempt for cursing His two-letter name (Yud-Kei).</p>
<p class="bas indent1"><span class="nm">(c)</span><span class="cl">Objection:</span> This is obvious. The Mishnah says 'Yosi should strike Yosi' (it picked a four-letter substitute in place of Hash-m's four-letter name)!</p>
<p class="bas indent1"><span class="nm">(d)</span><span class="cl">Answer:</span> One might have thought that the Tana just picked a name, without intent to teach about the name cursed. Rav Acha teaches that this is not so.</p>
<p class="bas indent1"><span class="nm">(e)</span><span class="cl">Version #2 (Rav Acha bar Yakov):</span> He is liable even for cursing Hash-m's four-letter name.</p>
<p class="bas indent1"><span class="nm">(f)</span><span class="cl">Objection:</span> This is obvious. The Mishnah says 'Yosi should strike Yosi'!</p>
<p class="bas indent1"><span class="nm">(g)</span><span class="cl">Answer:</span> One might have thought that he must curse the Great Name (of 42 letters), and the Tana just picked a short name, even though it does not resemble the name cursed.</p>
<p class="bas subject"><span class="nm">3)</span>THE WITNESS'S REPETITION OF THE BLASPHEMY</p>
<p class="bas indent1"><span class="nm">(a)</span><span class="cl">(Mishnah):</span> When they reach a final verdict...</p>
<p class="bas indent1"><span class="nm">(b)</span><span class="cl">Question:</span> What is the source that they must stand?</p>
<p class="bas indent1"><span class="nm">(c)</span><span class="cl">Answer (R. Yitzchak bar Aba):</span> We learn from a Kal va'Chomer - "Devar Elokim Li Elecha... va'Yakam me'Al ha'Kisei";</p>
<p class="bas indent2"><span class="nm">1.</span>Eglon, the king of Mo'av was a Nochri. He only recognized (and heard) a Kinuy for Hash-m's name, and he stood up. If a Yisrael hears Hash-m's essential name, and all the more so he must stand!</p>
<p class="bas indent1"><span class="nm">(d)</span><span class="cl">Question:</span> What is the source that they must tear their garments?</p>
<p class="bas indent1"><span class="nm">(e)</span><span class="cl">Answer:</span> "Elyakim (and the others who heard the blasphemy of Sancheriv's Shali'ach Ravshake) Keru'ei Vegadim."</p>
<p class="bas indent1"><span class="nm">(f)</span><span class="cl">(Mishnah):</span> They do not sew it back.</p>
<p class="bas indent1"><span class="nm">(g)</span><span class="cl">Question:</span> What is the source of this?</p>
<p class="bas indent1"><span class="nm">(h)</span><span class="cl">Answer:</span> We learn from a Gezerah Shavah "Kri'ah-Kri'ah":</p>
<p class="bas indent2"><span class="nm">1.</span>It says here "Keru'ei Vegadim", like it says about Elisha (who tore when Eliyahu went up to Shamayim) "va'Yachazek bi'Vgadav va'Yikra'em li'Shnayim Kera'im";</p>
<p class="bas indent3"><span class="nm">i.</span><span class="cl">Question:</span> Since it says that he tore them in two, the word "Kera'im" is unnecessary!</p>
<p class="bas indent3"><span class="nm">ii.</span><span class="cl">Answer:</span> This teaches that they will be permanently torn.</p>
<p class="bas indent1"><span class="nm">(i)</span><span class="cl">(Beraisa):</span> One who hears blasphemy, and one who hears a second-hand report of blasphemy must tear his garments;</p>
<p class="bas indent2"><span class="nm">1.</span>The witnesses do not tear, for they already tore when they witnessed the blasphemy.</p>
<p class="bas indent1"><span class="nm">(j)</span><span class="cl">Question:</span> Even so, since they hear now, they should tear again!</p>
<p class="bas indent1"><span class="nm">(k)</span><span class="cl">Answer:</span> "Ki'Shmo'a Chizkiyahu va'Yikra Es Begadav" - Chizkiyah tore, but not the ones who told him (for they already tore).</p>
<p class="bas indent1"><span class="nm">(l)</span><span class="cl">(Rav Yehudah):</span> One who hears a Nochri blaspheme need not tear his garment.</p>
<p class="bas indent1"><span class="nm">(m)</span><span class="cl">Question:</span> They tore when Ravshake blasphemed!</p>
<p class="bas indent1"><span class="nm">(n)</span><span class="cl">Answer:</span> He was a Yisrael Mumar.</p>
<p class="bas indent1"><span class="nm">(o)</span><span class="cl">(Rav Yehudah):</span> We tear only upon hearing blasphemy of Hash-m's essential name, but not for a Kinuy.</p>
<p class="bas indent2"><span class="nm">1.</span>R. Chiya argues with both of these laws.</p>
<p class="bas indent2"><span class="nm">2.</span><span class="cl">(R. Chiya):</span> One who hears blasphemy today need not tear his garment. If not, one's garment would be in shreds!</p>
<p class="bas indent2"><span class="nm">3.</span><span class="cl">Question:</span> From whom is the blasphemy heard?</p>
<p class="bas indent3"><span class="nm">i.</span>If cannot be from Yisraelim. They do not blaspheme so often!</p>
<p class="bas indent2"><span class="nm">4.</span><span class="cl">Answer:</span> He refers to blasphemy of Nochrim.</p>
<p class="bas indent2"><span class="nm">5.</span>They do not know Hash-m's essential name. Rather, they curse a Kinuy.</p>
<p class="bas indent2"><span class="nm">6.</span><span class="cl">Conclusion:</span> R. Chiya exempts only nowadays (for the reason given), but letter of the law, one should tear!</p>
<p class="bas indent1"><span class="nm">(p)</span><span class="cl">(Mishnah):</span> The second witness says 'I heard like he said.'</p>
<p class="bas indent1"><span class="nm">(q)</span><span class="cl">(Reish Lakish):</span> This teaches that mid'Oraisa, 'I (saw or heard) like him' is valid testimony in monetary and capital cases;</p>
<p class="bas indent2"><span class="nm">1.</span>Chachamim (normally) are stringent to require him to explicitly say the testimony. Regarding blasphemy, it is forbidden for him to repeat it, so we follow the mid'Oraisa law.</p>
<p class="bas indent2"><span class="nm">2.</span>If it were invalid, we would not kill someone without hearing proper testimony, just because the witness may not say it!</p>
<p class="bas indent1"><span class="nm">(r)</span><span class="cl">(Mishnah):</span> (If there is) a third witness, he says 'I heard like he said.'</p>
<p class="bas indent1"><span class="nm">(s)</span>Our Stam Mishnah is like R. Akiva, who equates a third witness to the first two. (He must testify, for perhaps he will contradict the others, and disqualify all the testimony.)</p>

<p class="bas subject"><span class="nm">4)</span>WHICH AVODOS OF IDOLATRY ARE FORBIDDEN?</p>
<p class="bas indent1"><span class="nm">(a)</span><span class="cl">(Mishnah):</span> One is Chayav Misah for idolatry:</p>
<p class="bas indent2"><span class="nm">1.</span>Whether he serves it (this will be explained), or whether he is Zove'ach, Maktir, Menasech or Mishtachaveh (slaughters, burns, pours libations or bows);</p>
<p class="bas indent2"><span class="nm">2.</span>If he accepts it as a god, and says 'you are my god';</p>
<p class="bas indent1"><span class="nm">(b)</span>The following are forbidden by a Lav:</p>
<p class="bas indent2"><span class="nm">1.</span>Hugging and kissing (an idol), sweeping or spraying (water to prevent dust from rising) around it, washing, anointing, dressing, or putting shoes on it;</p>
<p class="bas indent2"><span class="nm">2.</span>Vowing or swearing in the name of idolatry.</p>
<p class="bas indent1"><span class="nm">(c)</span>Ba'al Pe'or is served by excreting in front of it. Markulis is served by throwing rocks at it (one who does so is Chayav Misah).</p>
<p class="bas indent1"><span class="nm">(d)</span><span class="cl">(Gemara):</span> Question: What does it mean 'whether he serves it...'? (The Mishnah proceeds to list ways of serving it!)</p>
<p class="bas indent1"><span class="nm">(e)</span><span class="cl">Answer (R. Yirmeyah):</span> It means, whether he serves it through its normal Avodah, or whether he is Zove'ach, Maktir, Menasech or Mishtachaveh, even if this is not its normal Avodah.</p>
<p class="bas indent1"><span class="nm">(f)</span><span class="cl">Question:</span> Why does the Mishnah omit Zerikah (throwing)?</p>
<p class="bas indent1"><span class="nm">(g)</span><span class="cl">Answer (Abaye):</span> Menasech is Zerikah - "Bal Asich Niskehem mi'Dam" (this refers to Zerikah to idolatry).</p>
<p class="bas indent1"><span class="nm">(h)</span><span class="cl">Question:</span> What is the source (that one is liable for serving through its normal Avodah, and also other ways)?</p>
<p class="bas indent1"><span class="nm">(i)</span><span class="cl">Answer (Beraisa):</span> Had it said 'Zove'ach Yocharam", one might have thought that it discusses Shechutei Chutz (slaughtering Kodshim outside the Mikdash);</p>
<p class="bas indent2"><span class="nm">1.</span>Therefore, it says "Zove'ach la'Elohim Yocharam" - one who slaughters to idolatry.</p>
<p class="bas indent1"><span class="nm">(j)</span><span class="cl">Question:</span> This teaches only about slaughtering. What is the source to include Haktarah and Nisuch?</p>
<p class="bas indent1"><span class="nm">(k)</span><span class="cl">Answer:</span> "Bilti la'Shem Levado" - all the Avodos may only be done for Hash-m.</p>
<p class="bas indent1"><span class="nm">(l)</span><span class="cl">Question:</span> ("Va'Yelech va'Ya'avod Elokim Acherim va'Yishtachu Lahem" included all the Avodos.) Zevichah was taught by itself ("Zove'ach la'Elokim Yocharam"), to teach that one is liable for slaughtering even if this is not the normal Avodah of the idolatry). This teaches about all Avodas Panim (i.e. Avodah in the Mikdash that is forbidden (even to Hash-m) outside the Mikdash);</p>
<p class="bas indent2"><span class="nm">1.</span>What is the source for Hishtachava'ah?</p>
<p class="bas indent1"><span class="nm">(m)</span><span class="cl">Answer:</span> It says "va'Yelech... va'Yishtachu", and nearby it says "v'Hotzeisa Es ha'Ish... u'Skaltam."</p>
<p class="bas indent1"><span class="nm">(n)</span><span class="cl">Question:</span> This teaches the punishment. Which verse warns not to do it?</p>
<p class="bas indent1"><span class="nm">(o)</span><span class="cl">Answer:</span> "Ki Lo Sishtachaveh l'Kel Acher."</p>
<p class="bas indent1"><span class="nm">(p)</span><span class="cl">Question:</span> Perhaps we should include hugging, kissing and putting shoes on it!</p>
<p class="bas indent1"><span class="nm">(q)</span><span class="cl">Answer:</span> Zevichah was included in Avodah. It was taught by itself to equate the other Avodos to itself:</p>
<p class="bas indent2"><span class="nm">1.</span>Just like Zevichah is Avodas Panim, and one is Chayav Misah for Zevichah (to idolatry), one is Chayav Misah for all Avodas Panim;</p>
<p class="bas indent2"><span class="nm">2.</span>Hishtachava'ah was taught by itself, to teach about itself;</p>
<p class="bas indent2"><span class="nm">3.</span>Zevichah was taught by itself, to teach the general rule.</p>
<p class="bas indent1"><span class="nm">(r)</span><span class="cl">Question:</span> The Beraisa said 'Had it said "Zove'ach Yocharam", one might have thought that it discusses Shechutei Chutz';</p>
<p class="bas indent2"><span class="nm">1.</span>Shechutei Chutz is only Chayavei Kerisus. One is not Chayav Misah for it!</p>
<p class="bas indent1"><span class="nm">(s)</span><span class="cl">Answer:</span> One might have thought that if he was warned, he is killed, and if he was not warned, he is Chayav Kares.</p>
<p class="bas subject"><span class="nm">5)</span>PLANNING FOR ONE <i>AVODAH</i> WHILE PERFORMING ANOTHER</p>
<p class="bas indent1"><span class="nm">(a)</span><span class="cl">Suggestion (Rava bar Rav Chanan):</span> We should say that Hishtachava'ah teaches the general rule (that one is liable for showing honor to idolatry, even if it is not Avodas Penim)?</p>
<p class="bas indent2"><span class="nm">1.</span><span class="cl">Question:</span> If so, what would we learn from "Zove'ach...."?</p>
<p class="bas indent2"><span class="nm">2.</span><span class="cl">Answer:</span> It would teach that intent is projected from one Avodah to another. (If one did an Avodah in order to (later) pour the blood or burn the Chelev to idolatry, he is liable is as if he did this first Avodah for idolatry).</p>
<p class="bas indent3"><span class="nm">i.</span><span class="cl">(R. Yochanan):</span> If one slaughtered an animal in order to pour the blood or burn the Chelev to idolatry, the animal is forbidden;</p>
<p class="bas indent3"><span class="nm">ii.</span><span class="cl">(Reish Lakish):</span> It is permitted.</p>
