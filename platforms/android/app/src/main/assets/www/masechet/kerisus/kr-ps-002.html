<p class="bas indent1"><span class="nm">(a)</span><span class="cl">(Mishnah):</span> There are 36 Aveiros punishable with Kares (when transgressed b'Mezid):</p>
<p class="bas indent2"><span class="nm">1.</span>A man who has relations with any of the following (gets Kares, and also the woman does):</p>
<p class="bas indent3"><span class="nm">i.</span>His mother, his father's wife, his daughter-in-law, a woman and her daughter (this includes his wife's daughter, granddaughters, mother, and grandmothers), or a married woman;</p>
<p class="bas indent3"><span class="nm">ii.</span>His sister; the sister of his father, mother, or wife; the wife of his brother or of his father's brother; a Nidah;</p>
<p class="bas indent3"><span class="nm">iii.</span>Another man, or an animal;</p>
<p class="bas indent2"><span class="nm">2.</span>A woman who has relations with an animal;</p>
<p class="bas indent2"><span class="nm">3.</span>Megadef (blasphemy), Avodah Zarah, giving some of one's descendants to Molech (a ritual that is, or resembles, idolatry), Ba'al Ov (a way of conjuring up the dead);</p>
<p class="bas indent2"><span class="nm">4.</span>Mechalel Shabbos, a Tamei person who ate Kodshim or entered the Mikdash, one who eats Chelev, blood, Nosar, or Pigul, one who slaughters or offers to Hash-m outside the Mikdash;</p>
<p class="bas indent2"><span class="nm">5.</span>One who eats Chametz during Pesach, or eats or does Melachah on Yom Kipur;</p>
<p class="bas indent2"><span class="nm">6.</span>One who scents oil (like the composition of the Shemen ha'Mishchah), or makes (incense just like the) Ketores, or anoints with the Shemen ha'Mishchah (that Moshe made);</p>
<p class="bas indent2"><span class="nm">7.</span>A man who does not fulfill either of the following Mitzvos Aseh -- circumcision (of himself) or Korban Pesach.</p>
<p class="bas indent1"><span class="nm">(b)</span>If one transgresses any of these b'Mezid, he is Chayav Kares;</p>
<p class="bas indent1"><span class="nm">(c)</span>R. Meir says, (except for the Mitzvos Aseh,) if he transgresses b'Shogeg, he brings a Chatas;</p>
<p class="bas indent2"><span class="nm">1.</span>If he is in doubt whether he transgressed, he brings an Asham Taluy.</p>
<p class="bas indent2"><span class="nm">2.</span>The only (other) exceptions (from Asham Taluy) are a Tamei who ate Kodshim or entered the Mikdash, since the Korban for this (if done b'Shogeg) is not Chatas Kavu'ah (in which even an Oni (poor person) brings an animal), rather, Oleh v'Yored (an Oni brings only birds or flour).</p>
<p class="bas indent1"><span class="nm">(d)</span>Chachamim say, also Megadef is exempt from a Korban. "Torah Achas Yihyeh Lachem la'Oseh bi'Shegagah" excludes Megadef, who does not do an act. (He only speaks.)</p>

<p class="bas subject"><span class="nm">2)</span><i>MINYANIM</i> IN THE MISHNAH</p>
<p class="bas indent1"><span class="nm">(a)</span><span class="cl">(Gemara) Question:</span> Why does the Mishnah give a Minyan (tell how many there are)?</p>
<p class="bas indent1"><span class="nm">(b)</span><span class="cl">Answer (R. Yochanan):</span> This teaches that if one transgressed all of them in one He'elem (one forgetting; he did not realize in between that he transgressed), he brings a Korban for each one.</p>
<p class="bas indent1"><span class="nm">(c)</span><span class="cl">(Mishnah):</span> There are 39 Avos Melachos.</p>
<p class="bas indent1"><span class="nm">(d)</span><span class="cl">Question:</span> Why does the Mishnah give a Minyan?</p>
<p class="bas indent1"><span class="nm">(e)</span><span class="cl">Answer:</span> This teaches that if one transgressed all of them in one He'elem (he forgot that these Melachos are forbidden), he brings a Korban for each one.</p>
<p class="bas indent1"><span class="nm">(f)</span><span class="cl">(Mishnah):</span> There are four Mechusharei Kaparah (people who must bring a Korban to complete their Taharah - Zav, Zavah, Yoledes, and Metzora).</p>
<p class="bas indent1"><span class="nm">(g)</span><span class="cl">Question:</span> Why does the Mishnah give the number? (It lists all four!)</p>
<p class="bas indent1"><span class="nm">(h)</span><span class="cl">Answer:</span> This is to argue with R. Eliezer ben Yakov, who says that there are five;</p>
<p class="bas indent2"><span class="nm">1.</span><span class="cl">(Beraisa - R. Eliezer ben Yakov):</span> A convert is Mechushar Kaparah until he brings the Korban of a convert.</p>
<p class="bas indent1"><span class="nm">(i)</span><span class="cl">(Mishnah):</span> For four Aveiros one brings a Korban for Mezid, like for Shogeg.</p>
<p class="bas indent1"><span class="nm">(j)</span><span class="cl">Question:</span> Why does the Mishnah give a Minyan?</p>
<p class="bas indent1"><span class="nm">(k)</span><span class="cl">Answer:</span> This is to argue with R. Shimon;</p>
<p class="bas indent2"><span class="nm">1.</span><span class="cl">(Beraisa - R. Shimon):</span> There is no atonement (Korban) for one who intentionally falsely swore Shevu'as ha'Pikadon.</p>
<p class="bas indent1"><span class="nm">(l)</span><span class="cl">(Mishnah):</span> There are five cases in which one Korban is brought for multiple Aveiros.</p>
<p class="bas indent1"><span class="nm">(m)</span><span class="cl">Question:</span> Why does the Mishnah give a Minyan?</p>
<p class="bas indent1"><span class="nm">(n)</span><span class="cl">Answer:</span> This is for the sake of the Seifa;</p>
<p class="bas indent2"><span class="nm">1.</span><span class="cl">(Seifa):</span> A Nazir who became Tamei many times (brings one Korban).</p>
<p class="bas indent2"><span class="nm">2.</span>The case is, he repeatedly became Tamei on the seventh day (from the previous Tum'ah, after having become Tahor). This is like R. Yosi b'Rebbi Yehudah, who says that a Nazir Tamei begins Nezirus Taharah on day seven;</p>
<p class="bas indent2"><span class="nm">3.</span>It cannot be like Rebbi, who says that Nezirus Taharah begins on day eight;</p>
<p class="bas indent3"><span class="nm">i.</span>If he became Tamei on day seven, he had not yet begin Nezirus Taharah, so it is like one Tum'ah;</p>
<p class="bas indent3"><span class="nm">ii.</span>If he became Tamei on day eight, he was already obligated to bring his Korban Tum'ah. Surely he must bring another Korban for the next Tum'ah!</p>
<p class="bas indent1"><span class="nm">(o)</span><span class="cl">Question:</span> What is the argument of Rebbi and R. Yosi b'Rebbi Yehudah?</p>
<p class="bas indent1"><span class="nm">(p)</span><span class="cl">Answer (Beraisa - Rebbi):</span> "V'Kidash Es Rosho ba'Yom ha'Hu" teaches that he starts Nezirus Taharah on the day he brings Korbanos Tum'ah (day eight);</p>
<p class="bas indent2"><span class="nm">1.</span>R. Yosi b'Rebbi Yehudah says, it is the day he shaves (day seven).</p>
<p class="bas indent1"><span class="nm">(q)</span><span class="cl">(Mishnah #1):</span> There are five Aveiros (or Tum'os) for which anyone (liable) brings Oleh v'Yored.</p>
<p class="bas indent1"><span class="nm">(r)</span><span class="cl">Question:</span> Why does the Mishnah give a Minyan?</p>
<p class="bas indent1"><span class="nm">(s)</span><span class="cl">Answer:</span> This is to argue with R. Eliezer;</p>
<p class="bas indent2"><span class="nm">1.</span><span class="cl">(Mishnah #2):</span> (Just like the Sanhedrin does not bring Par He'elem Davar for a mistaken ruling about Shevu'as ha'Edus, Shevu'as Bituy or Tum'as Mikdash and Kodshim), a Nasi is exempt for these.</p>
<p class="bas indent2"><span class="nm">2.</span>Mishnah #1 says "five" to argue with R. Eliezer, who says that a Nasi brings a Sa'ir for Tum'as Mikdash v'Kodashav.</p>
<p class="bas subject"><span class="nm">3)</span><i>MINYANIM</i> (cont.)</p>
<p class="bas indent1"><span class="nm">(a)</span><span class="cl">(Mishnah):</span> There are four Avos Nezikim (categories of damagiers).</p>
<p class="bas indent1"><span class="nm">(b)</span><span class="cl">Question:</span> Why does the Mishnah give a Minyan?</p>
<p class="bas indent1"><span class="nm">(c)</span><span class="cl">Answer:</span> This excludes the other nine of R. Oshaya, who counts 13. (One of the four Avos is Mav'eh. Rav - this is man. It alludes to the other nine damages. Shmuel - Mav'eh is Shen (damage through animals eating). The Mishnah counts only damage of a man's property, but not of the man himself.)</p>
<p class="bas indent1"><span class="nm">(d)</span><span class="cl">Question:</span> Why does R. Oshaya give a Minyan?</p>
<p class="bas indent1"><span class="nm">(e)</span><span class="cl">Answer:</span> This is to exclude the other 11 of R. Chiya, who counts 24. (R. Oshaya does not count fines.)</p>
<p class="bas indent1"><span class="nm">(f)</span><span class="cl">Question:</span> Why does R. Chiya give a Minyan?</p>
<p class="bas indent1"><span class="nm">(g)</span><span class="cl">Answer:</span> This is to exclude Moser (one who suggests to powerful people to take the money of others) and Mefagel (a Kohen who says during the Avodah that he intends to eat or offer part of a Korban after the permitted time).</p>
<p class="bas subject"><span class="nm">4)</span>CHILUKEI KERISOS</p>
<p class="bas indent1"><span class="nm">(a)</span><span class="cl">(R. Yochanan):</span> If one transgressed all of them in one He'elem he brings a Korban for each one.</p>
<p class="bas indent1"><span class="nm">(b)</span><span class="cl">Question:</span> We understand why one is not exempt (Be'er Sheva - if he transgressed only some of them; Aruch l'Ner - if he did all of them, we do not say that this is so severe that Chata'os will not atone for him) - "Ki Kol Asher Ya'aseh mi'Kol ha'To'evos ha'Eleh v'Nichresu ha'Nefashos ha'Osos mi'Kerev Amam";</p>
<p class="bas indent2"><span class="nm">1.</span>We should say just like one is liable once for one Kares b'Shogeg, also if he transgressed all of them in one He'elem! (We will refer to the Isur of relations with Arayos by mere mention of the relative.)</p>
<p class="bas indent1"><span class="nm">(c)</span><span class="cl">Answer (R. Yochanan):</span> Kares is explicitly written regarding Achoso (one's sister) to teach that one who transgresses several Kerisos is liable for each.</p>
<p class="bas indent1"><span class="nm">(d)</span><span class="cl">Question (Rav Bivi bar Abaye):</span> Perhaps one is liable for Achoso alone, and one is liable only once for all of the other Kerisos, since they were in one He'elem!</p>
<p class="bas indent2"><span class="nm">1.</span><span class="cl">Question:</span> Does Rav Bivi argue with the following?!</p>
<p class="bas indent3"><span class="nm">i.</span><span class="cl">(Beraisa):</span> Any matter that was part of a Klal (general rule), and it received a new law, the new law was taught not only regarding that matter. Rather, it applies to the entire Klal:</p>
<p class="bas indent3"><span class="nm">ii.</span>For example, "veha'Nefesh Asher Tochal" obligates Kares for eating Shelamim b'Tum'ah;</p>
<p class="bas indent3"><span class="nm">iii.</span>Shelamim is in the Klal of Kodshim. It was singled out to equate all Kodshei Mizbe'ach to it, to obligate Kares for eating any of them b'Tum'ah, but not for Kodshei Bedek ha'Bayis.</p>
<p class="bas indent2"><span class="nm">2.</span><span class="cl">Answer:</span> No. just like there, Kodshei Bedek ha'Bayis are excluded, likewise here, we learn only about Arayos like a sister, which cannot be permitted b'Chayei Osrah (in the life of the one due to whom they are forbidden);</p>
<p class="bas indent3"><span class="nm">i.</span>We could not learn about a married woman, which can be permitted (through divorce) b'Chayei (Osrah, i.e.) Ba'alah.</p>
<p class="bas indent1"><span class="nm">(e)</span><span class="cl">Answer (R. Yonah):</span> "Ki Kol Asher Ya'aseh mi'Kol ha'To'evos" equates all Arayos to a sister;</p>
<p class="bas indent2"><span class="nm">1.</span>Just like one is liable for Achoso alone, the same applies to all Arayos.</p>
<p class="bas indent1"><span class="nm">(f)</span><span class="cl">Question:</span> R. Yitzchak taught that all Arayos are Chayavei Kares. The Torah (superfluously) mentions Kares for Achoso teaches that the punishment for it (and all other Chayavei Kares) is Kares, and not lashes;</p>
<p class="bas indent2"><span class="nm">1.</span>According to R. Yitzchak, what is the source to be Mechalek (obligate a Korban for every Kares)?</p>
<p class="bas indent1"><span class="nm">(g)</span><span class="cl">Answer:</span> He learns from "v'El Ishah b'Nidas Tumasah Lo Sikrav." "Ishah" is extra, to obligate for each Ervah.</p>
<p class="bas indent1"><span class="nm">(h)</span><span class="cl">Question:</span> Chachamim should also learn from "v'El Ishah"! (Why do they require explicit mention of Kares regarding Achoso?)</p>
<p class="bas indent1"><span class="nm">(i)</span><span class="cl">Answer:</span> Indeed, "v'El Ishah" teaches Chiluk (in most cases);</p>
<p class="bas indent2"><span class="nm">1.</span>(Kares regarding) Achoso is Mechalek different Arayos that all stem from sisterhood, i.e. a sister, a paternal aunt and a maternal aunt.</p>
<p class="bas indent1"><span class="nm">(j)</span><span class="cl">Question:</span> Surely, one is liable for each of these. They are different Arayos and different women!</p>
<p class="bas indent1"><span class="nm">(k)</span><span class="cl">Answer:</span> It obligates separate Chata'os for one woman forbidden due to different Arayos, e.g. his sister is his paternal aunt and his maternal aunt. (Rashi explains how this is possible, like the Gemara says below (15a).)</p>
<p class="bas indent1"><span class="nm">(l)</span><span class="cl">Question:</span> What is R. Yitzchak's source for this?</p>
<p class="bas indent1"><span class="nm">(m)</span><span class="cl">Answer:</span> He learns from the end of the verse "Ervas Achoso Gilah."</p>
<p class="bas indent1"><span class="nm">(n)</span><span class="cl">Question:</span> How do Chachamim expound this?</p>
<p class="bas indent1"><span class="nm">(o)</span><span class="cl">Answer:</span> When listing the Arayos punishable by Kares, the Torah (explicitly lists a paternal <i>or</i> maternal sister, and then) lists a full sister (even though all the more so, there is Kares for her) to teach that Ein Onshin Min ha'Din (we do not punish due to a Kal va'Chomer).</p>
<p class="bas indent2"><span class="nm">1.</span>R. Yitzchak holds that Onshin Min ha'Din. (Therefore, "Ervas Achoso Gilah" is extra);</p>
<p class="bas indent2"><span class="nm">2.</span>Alternatively, he agrees that Ein Onshin Min ha'Din. He learns the punishment from the warning. ("Achoscha Hi" explicitly forbids a full sister.)</p>
