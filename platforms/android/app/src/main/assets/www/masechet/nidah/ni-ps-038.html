<p class="bas subject"><span class="nm">1)</span>WHICH DAYS ARE WE <i>METAHER</i>?</p>
<p class="bas indent1"><span class="nm">(a)</span><span class="cl">(Mishnah - R. Meir):</span> Even 40 or 50 days before birth, we attribute blood to the birth.</p>
<p class="bas indent1"><span class="nm">(b)</span><span class="cl">Question:</span> It suffices to say that 50 days before we attribute. There is no need to say 40 days!</p>
<p class="bas indent1"><span class="nm">(c)</span><span class="cl">Answer (Rav Chisda):</span> For a healthy woman we attribute 40 days, and for a sick woman 50 days.</p>
<p class="bas indent1"><span class="nm">(d)</span><span class="cl">Version #1 (Levi):</span> We are Metaher blood (seen amidst Koshi) only if it comes in the days when she can become a Zavah. (Rashi - these are the 11 days after the seven days of Nidah. R. Chananel - it is the first nine of these days, for a first sighting on day 10 or 11 cannot lead to (full) Tum'as Zivah);</p>
<p class="bas indent1"><span class="nm">(e)</span><span class="cl">(Rav):</span> We are Metaher blood even if it comes in the (following seven) days proper to count to become Tehorah.</p>
<p class="bas indent1"><span class="nm">(f)</span><span class="cl">(Rav Ada bar Ahavah):</span> According to Rav, we are always Metaher (if the first sighting was in the days of Zivah), for all the following days are proper to count, if she would be Soser her count!</p>
<p class="bas indent1"><span class="nm">(g)</span><span class="cl">Question (against Levi - Mishnah - R. Meir):</span> Even 40 or 50 days before birth, we attribute blood to the birth.</p>
<p class="bas indent2"><span class="nm">1.</span>We understand according to Rav, as Rav Ada explained;</p>
<p class="bas indent2"><span class="nm">2.</span>However, according to Levi, we are Metaher only 11 (or nine) days!</p>
<p class="bas indent1"><span class="nm">(h)</span><span class="cl">Answer:</span> R. Meir did not say that she is Tehorah even if she saw on all these days. Rather, among the 40 or 50 days, if she saw during days of Nidah she is a Nidah. If she saw during days of Zivah she is Tehorah.</p>
<p class="bas indent1"><span class="nm">(i)</span><span class="cl">Version #2 (Levi):</span> We are Metaher blood only if it comes in the days when she can (start to) become a full Zavah. (Tosfos citing Rashi - these are the first nine of the 11 days of Zivah. R. Chananel - they are the last nine of these days, when she can <i>finish</i> becoming a full Zavah.)</p>
<p class="bas indent2"><span class="nm">1.</span><span class="cl">Question:</span> What is his source?</p>
<p class="bas indent2"><span class="nm">2.</span><span class="cl">Answer:</span> It says "<i>Damah</i> Yamim Rabim" (her own blood, and not due to Koshi).</p>
<p class="bas indent1"><span class="nm">(j)</span><span class="cl">(Aba Sha'ul citing Rebbi):</span> We are Metaher blood even if it comes in the days when she can become a Zavah Ketanah (through one or two sightings. I.e. we include all 11 days of Zivah);</p>
<p class="bas indent2"><span class="nm">1.</span><span class="cl">Question:</span> What is his source?</p>
<p class="bas indent2"><span class="nm">2.</span><span class="cl">Answer:</span> In the Parshah of Zavah we expound "Yemei" and "v'Kol (Yemei)" (to include Zavah Ketanah).</p>
<p class="bas indent1"><span class="nm">(k)</span><span class="cl">Question (against both of them - Mishnah - R. Meir):</span> Even 40 or 50 days before birth, we attribute blood to the birth.</p>
<p class="bas indent1"><span class="nm">(l)</span><span class="cl">Answer:</span> It does not say that she is Tehorah during all these days. Rather, if she saw during days of Nidah she is a Nidah. If she saw during days of Zivah, she is Tehorah.</p>
<p class="bas subject"><span class="nm">2)</span>WHEN DOES THE LAW OF <i>KOSHI</i> APPLY?</p>
<p class="bas indent1"><span class="nm">(a)</span><span class="cl">(Beraisa - R. Meir):</span> A woman can see blood amidst Koshi 150 consecutive days without becoming a Zavah:</p>
<p class="bas indent2"><span class="nm">1.</span>The case is, she saw the last two days of (the 11 days of) Zivah, then seven days of Nidah, then two days of Zivah, then 50 days of Koshi (and gave birth to a girl the next day), 80 days of Tum'as Yoledes and Dam Tohar for a Nekevah, seven days of Nidah, and two days of Zivah.</p>
<p class="bas indent2"><span class="nm">2.</span><span class="cl">Rabanan:</span> A woman can forever see blood every day amidst Koshi, without becoming a Zavah!</p>
<p class="bas indent2"><span class="nm">3.</span><span class="cl">R. Meir:</span> You allude to a woman who constantly miscarries females (within every 139 days -- 80 days of Yoledes, at most nine of Nidah and Zivah, and up to 50 days of Koshi before the next birth). You are wrong. The law of Koshi does not apply to miscarriages.</p>
<p class="bas indent1"><span class="nm">(b)</span><span class="cl">(Beraisa):</span> A woman can see blood 100 consecutive days (without pain) and not become a Zavah:</p>
<p class="bas indent2"><span class="nm">1.</span>The case is, she saw two days of Zivah, seven days of Nidah, two days of Zivah (and gave birth to a girl), 80 days of Yoledes, seven days of Nidah, and two days of Zivah.</p>
<p class="bas indent2"><span class="nm">2.</span><span class="cl">Question:</span> What is the Chidush?</p>
<p class="bas indent2"><span class="nm">3.</span><span class="cl">Answer:</span> (The Tana holds that) it is possible to give birth without blood (beforehand. If he held that she must see blood first, she would became a Zavah on the day of birth.)</p>
<p class="bas indent1"><span class="nm">(c)</span><span class="cl">(Mishnah - R. Yehudah):</span> The law of Koshi applies only in her (last, i.e. ninth) month.</p>
<p class="bas indent1"><span class="nm">(d)</span><span class="cl">(Beraisa - R. Yehudah):</span> The law of Koshi applies only in her (last) month. This is sometimes a stringency, and sometimes a leniency;</p>
<p class="bas indent2"><span class="nm">1.</span>If she saw blood amidst Koshi for the last two days of the eighth month and the first day of the ninth month, even if she gave birth at the beginning of the ninth month, she is a Zavah. (The majority of the three days were in the eighth month, when the law of Koshi does not apply);</p>
<p class="bas indent2"><span class="nm">2.</span>If she saw blood amidst Koshi on the last day of the eighth month and the first two days of the ninth month, she is not a Zavah. (The law of Koshi applies in the ninth month. It is as if she had only one day of Zivah.) This is even if she gives birth at the end of the ninth month.</p>
<p class="bas indent1"><span class="nm">(e)</span><span class="cl">(Rav Ada bar Ahavah):</span> This shows that R. Yehudah holds that the Shofar (blown to herald the coming month) causes the law of Koshi. (It depends on the ninth lunar month declared by Beis Din from the beginning of pregnancy, not nine full (30 day) months. If Kishuy did not depend on Rosh Chodesh, she could not know which day begins the ninth month. Even if she knew from which Bi'ah she became pregnant, she does not know whether conception was that same day, or on one of the next two days!)</p>
<p class="bas indent1"><span class="nm">(f)</span><span class="cl">Question:</span> (R. Yehudah holds that a woman can give birth at the beginning of the ninth month.) However, Shmuel taught that a woman gives birth after exactly 271, 272 or 273 days (nine full months after conception, which is on the first, second or third day) from Bi'ah!</p>
<p class="bas indent1"><span class="nm">(g)</span><span class="cl">Answer:</span> Shmuel holds like the early Chasidim;</p>
<p class="bas indent2"><span class="nm">1.</span><span class="cl">(Beraisa):</span> The early Chasidim would have Bi'ah only on Wednesday (Tuesday night), to avoid the possibility of desecration of Shabbos (due to birth on Shabbos. Maharsha - also Bris Milah on Shabbos is called Chilul).</p>
<p class="bas bbbline">38b----------------------------------------38b</p>
<p class="bas indent2"><span class="nm">2.</span><span class="cl">Question:</span> According to Shmuel, if Bi'ah is on Wednesday, the baby will be born (on day 271, 272 or 273, i.e.) on Sunday, Monday or Tuesday. Even if Bi'ah was on one of the next three days, the baby would not be born on Shabbos!</p>
<p class="bas indent2"><span class="nm">3.</span><span class="cl">Answer:</span> The Beraisa means that they would have Bi'ah only on Tuesday night or later in the week.</p>
<p class="bas indent1"><span class="nm">(h)</span><span class="cl">(Mar Zutra):</span> The early Chasidim learn from "va'Yiten Hash-m Lah <i>Herayon.</i>" -- the Gematri'a of Herayon (pregnancy) is 271.</p>
<p class="bas indent1"><span class="nm">(i)</span><span class="cl">(Mar Zutra):</span> Even according to the opinion that a nine month birth is always born after nine full months, a seven month birth can be born at the beginning of the seventh month -- "va'Yehi li'Sekufos ha'Yamim... va'Teled." Sekufos teaches two seasons (six months), and Yamim teaches another two days.</p>
<p class="bas indent1"><span class="nm">(j)</span><span class="cl">(Mishnah - R. Yosi and R. Shimon):</span> The law of Koshi applies only in the two weeks before the birth.</p>
<p class="bas indent1"><span class="nm">(k)</span><span class="cl">(Shmuel):</span> They learn from "v'Tam'ah Shevu'ayim k'Nidasah" -- there are two weeks in which she can become a Nidah, but not a Zavah, i.e. Koshi.</p>
<p class="bas indent1"><span class="nm">(l)</span><span class="cl">(Beraisa):</span> A woman can see blood amidst Koshi for 25 consecutive days and not become a Zavah:</p>
<p class="bas indent2"><span class="nm">1.</span>The case is, she saw the last two days of (the 11 days of) Zivah, then seven days of Nidah, then two days of Zivah, then 14 days of Koshi;</p>
<p class="bas indent2"><span class="nm">2.</span>If she sees 26 days without giving birth, she must become a Zavah.</p>
<p class="bas indent2"><span class="nm">3.</span><span class="cl">Objection:</span> If she does not give birth, the law of Koshi does not apply. After three days (during Yemei Zivah) she becomes a Zavah!</p>
<p class="bas indent2"><span class="nm">4.</span><span class="cl">Answer #1 (Rav Sheshes):</span> It means, if she (sees 26 days and) gives birth.</p>
<p class="bas indent2"><span class="nm">5.</span><span class="cl">Rejection (Rava):</span> It says '<i>without</i> giving birth'!</p>
<p class="bas indent2"><span class="nm">6.</span><span class="cl">Answer #2 (Rava):</span> Rather, it means that if she sees 26 days and gives birth, she must be Yoledes b'Zov;</p>
<p class="bas indent3"><span class="nm">i.</span>If she miscarries, after only three days (during Yemei Zivah) she becomes a Zavah!</p>

<p class="bas subject"><span class="nm">3)</span>DAM KOSHI DURING YEMEI TOHAR</p>
<p class="bas indent1"><span class="nm">(a)</span><span class="cl">(Mishnah):</span> If a woman saw blood amidst Koshi during (Yemei Tohar in) the 80 days after Yoledes Nekevah, all the blood is Tahor, until the birth;</p>
<p class="bas indent1"><span class="nm">(b)</span>R. Eliezer says, it is Teme'ah. (Rashi - this is whether it comes during the days of Nidah or Zivah. R. Menachem - it is only if it is during the days of Nidah.)</p>
<p class="bas indent2"><span class="nm">1.</span><span class="cl">Chachamim:</span> Normally, Dam Shofi (blood seen without pain) is more stringent than Dam Koshi (the former can cause Zivah). During Yemei Tohar, the Dam Shofi is Tahor, and all the more so Dam Koshi is Tahor!</p>

<p class="bas indent1"><span class="nm">(c)</span><span class="cl">(Gemara - Beraisa):</span> "Teshev" includes a woman who saw Dam Koshi during Yemei Tohar of Yoledes Nekevah. All the blood is Tahor, until the birth;</p>
