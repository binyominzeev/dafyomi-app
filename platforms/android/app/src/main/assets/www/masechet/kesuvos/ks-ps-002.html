<p class="bas subject"><span class="nm">1)</span>THE DAY ON WHICH A VIRGIN IS MARRIED</p>
<p class="bas indent1"><span class="nm">(a)</span><span class="cl">(Mishnah):</span> A virgin is married on Wednesday, and a widow on Thursday.</p>
<p class="bas indent1"><span class="nm">(b)</span>In cities, Beis Din meets on Mondays and Thursdays. If the Chasan finds that she is not a virgin, he will go to Beis Din immediately the next morning.</p>
<p class="bas indent1"><span class="nm">(c)</span><span class="cl">(Gemara - Rav Yosef):</span> Rav Yehudah taught that the reason that a virgin is married on Wednesday is like we learned in a Mishnah:</p>
<p class="bas indent2"><span class="nm">1.</span><span class="cl">(Mishnah):</span> If the time set for the Chupah came and they were not married, the Chasan must feed the Kalah. If he is a Kohen, she may eat Terumah.</p>
<p class="bas indent2"><span class="nm">2.</span>Now that our Mishnah says that the Chupah should be on Wednesday, if the date set for the Chupah fell on Sunday, he need not feed her until Wednesday.</p>
<p class="bas indent1"><span class="nm">(d)</span><span class="cl">Question (Rav Yosef):</span> Why does Rav Yehudah attribute a Mishnah that was taught to one that was not taught?!</p>
<p class="bas indent2"><span class="nm">1.</span><span class="cl">Objection:</span> This is not so. Both Mishnayos were taught!</p>
<p class="bas indent1"><span class="nm">(e)</span><span class="cl">Clarification of the question:</span> Rather, why does Rav Yehudah attribute the reason for our Mishnah, which gives its reason, to a Mishnah that does not give a reason?</p>
<p class="bas indent1"><span class="nm">(f)</span><span class="cl">Retraction (Rav Yosef):</span> Rather, Rav Yehudah taught that the reason a virgin is married on Wednesday is so if the Chasan finds that she is not a virgin, he will go to Beis Din immediately the next day.</p>
<p class="bas indent1"><span class="nm">(g)</span><span class="cl">Question (Rav Yosef):</span> Let her be married on Sunday, and he can go to Beis Din on Monday!</p>
<p class="bas indent1"><span class="nm">(h)</span><span class="cl">Answer:</span> Chachamim deliberated to help the Kalah, that the Chasan should exert for three days preparing the Chupah feast.</p>
<p class="bas indent2"><span class="nm">1.</span>Now that we learned that a virgin is married on Wednesday, if the time for the Chupah fell on Sunday, since he cannot marry her until Wednesday, he need not feed her until then.</p>
<p class="bas subject"><span class="nm">2)</span>IF THE KALAH BECOMES SICK OR NIDAH</p>
<p class="bas indent1"><span class="nm">(a)</span><span class="cl">(Rav Yosef):</span> If the time for the Chupah falls before Wednesday, the Chasan need not feed the Kalah until Wednesday;</p>
<p class="bas indent1"><span class="nm">(b)</span><span class="cl">Version #1:</span> Also, if one of them fell sick, or she became a Nidah (Tamei from menstrual blood, causing the Chupah to be postponed), he need not feed her.</p>
<p class="bas indent1"><span class="nm">(c)</span><span class="cl">Version #2 - Question:</span> If he became sick, must he feed her?</p>
<p class="bas indent2"><span class="nm">1.</span>Perhaps he need not, because the delay of the Chupah is beyond his control, just like when the time for the Chupah fell before Wednesday.</p>
<p class="bas indent2"><span class="nm">2.</span>Or, perhaps he must feed her. This is unlike when the enactment of Chachamim delayed the Chupah.</p>
<p class="bas indent1"><span class="nm">(d)</span><span class="cl">Question:</span> If he must feed her when he falls sick, what is the law if she falls sick?</p>
<p class="bas indent2"><span class="nm">1.</span>Perhaps he is exempt, for he can say 'I am ready!'</p>
<p class="bas indent2"><span class="nm">2.</span>Or, perhaps she can say 'your field was flooded (is your bad luck. You are obligated to feed me.)</p>
<p class="bas indent1"><span class="nm">(e)</span><span class="cl">Question:</span> If he must feed her when she falls sick, what if she becomes Nidah?</p>
<p class="bas indent2"><span class="nm">1.</span>If she became Nidah at the time of her Veses (her normal period), she cannot say that it is his bad luck;</p>
<p class="bas bbbline">2b----------------------------------------2b</p>
<p class="bas indent2"><span class="nm">2.</span>The question is if she becomes Nidah not at the time of her Veses.</p>
<p class="bas indent2"><span class="nm">3.</span>Perhaps she can say 'your field was flooded';</p>
<p class="bas indent2"><span class="nm">4.</span>Or, perhaps since some women change their Vestos, this is like becoming Nidah at the time of the Veses!</p>
<p class="bas indent1"><span class="nm">(f)</span><span class="cl">Answer (Rav Achai - Mishnah):</span> If the time came and <i>the women</i> were not married, he feeds them and they may eat Terumah.</p>
<p class="bas indent2"><span class="nm">1.</span>This connotes that the women are causing the delay.</p>
<p class="bas indent2"><span class="nm">2.</span><span class="cl">Question:</span> If they are delaying, why are they fed?</p>
<p class="bas indent2"><span class="nm">3.</span><span class="cl">Answer:</span> Rather, it must be that it is beyond their control (i.e. they became sick or Nidah), and we see that they are fed!</p>
<p class="bas indent1"><span class="nm">(g)</span><span class="cl">Rejection (Rav Ashi):</span> We can say that whenever they cause the Chupah to be delayed, they are not fed;</p>
<p class="bas indent2"><span class="nm">1.</span>Really, the men caused the delay. It says '<i>the women</i> were not married' because the Reisha discussed the women.</p>
<p class="bas subject"><span class="nm">3)</span>CAN A CLAIM OF <i>ONES</i> INVALIDATE A <i>GET</i>?</p>
<p class="bas indent1"><span class="nm">(a)</span><span class="cl">Version #1 (Rava):</span> The law of Gitin (divorce) is different (this will be explained).</p>
<p class="bas indent1"><span class="nm">(b)</span><span class="cl">Inference:</span> He holds that Ones (something beyond one's control) does not apply to (Mevatel) Gitin (If one gave a Get on Tnai (conditionally), even if the Tnai was fulfilled due to Ones, the Get is valid.</p>
<p class="bas indent1"><span class="nm">(c)</span><span class="cl">Question:</span> What is Rava's source?</p>
<p class="bas indent1"><span class="nm">(d)</span><span class="cl">Answer #1 (Mishnah):</span> If one gave a Get and said 'tThis is your Get if I don't come within a year' and he died during the year, the Get is invalid.</p>
<p class="bas indent2"><span class="nm">1.</span><span class="cl">Inference:</span> If he got sick, the Get is valid!</p>
<p class="bas indent1"><span class="nm">(e)</span><span class="cl">Rejection #1:</span> Even if he got sick, the Get is invalid. The Mishnah teaches that a Get cannot take effect after death.</p>
<p class="bas indent1"><span class="nm">(f)</span><span class="cl">Objection:</span> The Reisha already taught this!</p>
<p class="bas indent2"><span class="nm">1.</span><span class="cl">(Reisha):</span> If he said 'This is your Get... after (my) death', it is invalid!</p>
<p class="bas indent1"><span class="nm">(g)</span><span class="cl">Rejection #2:</span> Rather, the Seifa (cited above, 'if I don't come within a year...' ) teaches unlike Raboseinu:;</p>
<p class="bas indent2"><span class="nm">1.</span><span class="cl">(Beraisa):</span> Raboseinu permitted her to remarry</p>
<p class="bas indent2"><span class="nm">2.</span><span class="cl">(Rav Yehudah):</span> Raboseinu are the Beis Din who permitted oil of Nochrim. They hold like R. Yosi, who says that the date on a document shows that it takes effect from that day. (Therefore, the Get took effect before the husband died. We may not infer that it is valid if he got sick.)</p>
<p class="bas indent1"><span class="nm">(h)</span><span class="cl">Answer #2 (to Question (cb) - Seifa):</span> If he said 'Tthis Get should take effect from now if I don't come within a year', and he died during the year, the Get is valid.</p>
<p class="bas indent2"><span class="nm">1.</span><span class="cl">Inference:</span> Also if he got sick, the Get is valid!</p>
<p class="bas indent1"><span class="nm">(i)</span><span class="cl">Rejection:</span> Perhaps it is valid only if he dies, since his intent was that his wife should not fall to Yibum.</p>
<p class="bas indent1"><span class="nm">(j)</span><span class="cl">Answer #3:</span> A case occurred in which a man gave a Get on condition that he will not return within 30 days. He was returning on the 30th day, but was delayed because the ferry was on the other side. Even though he was trying to return, Shmuel ruled that the Get is valid.</p>
<p class="bas indent1"><span class="nm">(k)</span><span class="cl">Rejection:</span> Perhaps a common Ones is different. Since he should have stipulated what will be in such a case, but neglected to do so, he accepted on himself whatever will happen.</p>
<p class="bas indent1"><span class="nm">(l)</span><span class="cl">Answer #4:</span> Rava's law is a decree due to righteous women and immoral women.</p>
