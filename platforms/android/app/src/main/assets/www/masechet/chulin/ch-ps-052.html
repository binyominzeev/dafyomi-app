<div class="indent1"><span class="nm">(a)</span><p>If a bird lands on any if the following, we are not concerned for crushed limbs --</p></div>
<div class="indent2"><span class="nm">1.</span><p>A garment that was doubled over (for then it cannot be stretched tightly); the sides of bundles of flax; legumes other than clover; peas.</p></div>
<div class="indent2"><span class="nm">2.</span><p>The rule is, we are concerned if it fell on something that is not smooth, but not if it fell on something slippery.</p></div>
<div class="indent1"><span class="nm">(b)</span><p><span class="cl">(Rav Ashi):</span> If a bird's wings were glued (to a stick) and it fell, we are not concerned;</p></div>
<div class="indent1"><span class="nm">(c)</span><p><span class="cl">(Ameimar):</span> We are concerned.</p></div>
<div class="indent1"><span class="nm">(d)</span><p><span class="cl">Version #1:</span> If only one wing was glued, all agree that it is Kosher; they argue when both wings were glued:</p></div>
<div class="indent2"><span class="nm">1.</span><p>Ameimar holds that it cannot fly at all, so it is like an animal that fell;</p></div>
<div class="indent2"><span class="nm">2.</span><p>Rav Ashi holds that it can flutter somewhat using the base of the wings (where people cut them off the bird), to soften the fall.</p></div>
<div class="indent1"><span class="nm">(e)</span><p><span class="cl">Version #2:</span> If both wings were glued, all agree that it is like a fallen animal. They argue when one wing was glued.</p></div>
<div class="indent2"><span class="nm">1.</span><p>Rav Ashi holds that it can fly somewhat using the unglued wing.</p></div>
<div class="indent2"><span class="nm">2.</span><p>Ameimar holds that since one wing is glued, it cannot fly with the other wing. It is like a fallen animal. (end of Version #2)</p></div>
<div class="indent1"><span class="nm">(f)</span><p>The Halachah is, if both wings were glued, it is like a fallen animal. If one wing was glued, it is Kosher.</p></div>
<div class="subject"><span class="nm">2)</span><p>BROKEN RIBS</p></div>
<div class="indent1"><span class="nm">(a)</span><p><span class="cl">(Mishnah):</span> If most of the ribs were broken.</p></div>
<div class="indent1"><span class="nm">(b)</span><p><span class="cl">(Beraisa):</span> If the majority were broken (it is Tereifah). This refers to six on each side, or all 11 on one side, and one on the other side (or any other way that they add to at least 12).</p></div>
<div class="indent2"><span class="nm">1.</span><p><span class="cl">(Ze'iri):</span> A rib is considered broken only if it is broken on the half closer to the spine.</p></div>
<div class="indent1"><span class="nm">(c)</span><p><span class="cl">(Rabah bar bar Chanah):</span> We consider the majority of the large ribs that have marrow inside.</p></div>
<div class="indent1"><span class="nm">(d)</span><p><span class="cl">(Ula):</span> If the majority of ribs on one side were uprooted, or the majority of both sides were broken, it is Tereifah.</p></div>
<div class="indent1"><span class="nm">(e)</span><p><span class="cl">(R. Yochanan):</span> In either case, we require a majority of both sides.</p></div>
<div class="indent1"><span class="nm">(f)</span><p><span class="cl">(Rav):</span> If one rib and the vertebra to which it is attached are uprooted, it is Tereifah.</p></div>
<div class="indent1"><span class="nm">(g)</span><p><span class="cl">Question (Rav Kahana and Rav Asi):</span> If the ribs on both sides of a vertebra are uprooted, but the vertebra itself is still attached, what is the law?</p></div>
<div class="indent1"><span class="nm">(h)</span><p><span class="cl">Answer (Rav):</span> That is like an animal cut into two pieces (it is Nevelah)!</p></div>
<div class="indent2"><span class="nm">1.</span><p><span class="cl">Question:</span> Also in Rav's case, it was cut into two pieces!</p></div>
<div class="indent2"><span class="nm">2.</span><p><span class="cl">Answer:</span> In Rav's case the rib was uprooted but the vertebra was intact.</p></div>
<div class="indent2"><span class="nm">3.</span><p><span class="cl">Objection:</span> Rav said 'if one rib and the vertebra...'!</p></div>
<div class="indent2"><span class="nm">4.</span><p><span class="cl">Answer:</span> He meant a rib and part of the vertebra to which it is attached.</p></div>
<div class="indent2"><span class="nm">5.</span><p><span class="cl">Question:</span> If so, Rav Kahana and Rav Asi asked about when the ribs alone are detached, and Rav said that the animal is Nevelah;</p></div>
<div class="indent3"><span class="nm">i.</span><p>Ula taught that if the majority of ribs on one side were uprooted (not just two), or the majority of both sides were broken, it is Tereifah (but not Nevelah)!</p></div>
<div class="indent2"><span class="nm">6.</span><p><span class="cl">Answer:</span> It is worse when two ribs from the same vertebra are uprooted.</p></div>
<div class="indent2"><span class="nm">7.</span><p><span class="cl">Question:</span> R. Yochanan said that if the majority of the ribs on both sides are uprooted it is Tereifah. A majority must include both ribs attached one of the vertebrae!</p></div>
<div class="indent2"><span class="nm">8.</span><p><span class="cl">Answer:</span> R. Yochanan discusses when the vertebra is complete. Rav Kahana and Rav Asi asked about when part of the vertebra is missing.</p></div>
<div class="indent2"><span class="nm">9.</span><p><span class="cl">Question:</span> If so, Rav's law answers their question!</p></div>
<div class="indent2"><span class="nm">10.</span><p><span class="cl">Answer:</span> They had not heard Rav's law. (This also shows that the premise of Question 5 was wrong.)</p></div>
<div class="indent2"><span class="nm">11.</span><p><span class="cl">Question:</span> If so, they should have asked about Rav's case (when one rib is uprooted)!</p></div>
<div class="indent2"><span class="nm">12.</span><p><span class="cl">Answer:</span> It is better to ask about when two are uprooted, for then one can derive the law when one is uprooted:</p></div>
<div class="indent3"><span class="nm">i.</span><p>If they asked about one, and Rav answered that it is Tereifah, they would know that all the more so, when two are uprooted it is Tereifah. However, if he answered that it is Kosher, they would not know the law about two;</p></div>
<div class="indent3"><span class="nm">ii.</span><p>Rather, they asked about two. If Rav would answer that it is Kosher, they would know that all the more it is Kosher one is uprooted.</p></div>
<div class="indent2"><span class="nm">13.</span><p><span class="cl">Question:</span> If Rav would answer that it is Tereifah, they would not know the law about one!</p></div>
<div class="indent2"><span class="nm">14.</span><p><span class="cl">Answer:</span> They could learn from Rav's response;</p></div>
<div class="indent3"><span class="nm">i.</span><p>If the law is that even one is Tereifah, Rav would respond in anger (since their question presumes that one is Kosher).</p></div>
<div class="indent2"><span class="nm">15.</span><p><span class="cl">Question:</span> Indeed, (Rav holds that) even one is Tereifah, but he did not respond angrily!</p></div>
<div class="indent2"><span class="nm">16.</span><p><span class="cl">Answer:</span> His amazement ('it is even Nevelah'!) is like responding angrily.</p></div>
<div class="indent1"><span class="nm">(i)</span><p><span class="cl">(Rabah bar Rav Shilo citing Shmuel):</span> Any of the following makes an animal Tereifah:</p></div>
<div class="indent2"><span class="nm">1.</span><p>A rib was uprooted from the spine; the majority of the skull was crushed, or a problem in the flesh covering the majority of the Keres.</p></div>
<div class="indent1"><span class="nm">(j)</span><p><span class="cl">Question:</span> This contradicts another teaching of Shmuel!</p></div>
<div class="bbbline">52b----------------------------------------52b</p></div>
<div class="indent2"><span class="nm">1.</span><p><span class="cl">(Mishnah - Beis Shamai):</span> If two vertebrae are missing from the spine, the spine is not Metamei b'Ohel;</p></div>
<div class="indent2"><span class="nm">2.</span><p>Beis Hillel say, even if one vertebra is missing, it is not Metamei b'Ohel.</p></div>
<div class="indent2"><span class="nm">3.</span><p><span class="cl">(Shmuel):</span> They argue similarly about how much must be missing to make (a person or animal) Tereifah (even without a rib being detached)!</p></div>
<div class="indent1"><span class="nm">(k)</span><p><span class="cl">Answer:</span> Here, Shmuel teaches that a detached rib makes a Tereifah, even if the vertebra is intact. There, he teaches that a missing vertebra makes a Tereifah, even if the ribs are intact.</p></div>
<div class="indent1"><span class="nm">(l)</span><p><span class="cl">Question:</span> Surely, a rib can be detached and the vertebra is intact. However, how can a vertebra be missing and the ribs are intact?</p></div>
<div class="indent1"><span class="nm">(m)</span><p><span class="cl">Answer:</span> The lower vertebrae do not have ribs attached to them.</p></div>
<div class="indent1"><span class="nm">(n)</span><p><span class="cl">Question (R. Oshaya):</span> According to Shmuel, this Mishnah should be taught among the Mishnayos in Maseches Idiyos in which Beis Shamai are more lenient than Beis Hillel!</p></div>
<div class="indent1"><span class="nm">(o)</span><p><span class="cl">Answer (Rava):</span> They Mishnah was taught regarding Tum'ah. Regarding Tum'ah Beis Shamai are more stringent.</p></div>
<div class="subject"><span class="nm">3)</span><p>OTHER TEACHINGS OF SHMUEL</p></div>
<div class="indent1"><span class="nm">(a)</span><p><span class="cl">(Shmuel):</span> If the majority of the skull was crushed it is Tereifah.</p></div>
<div class="indent1"><span class="nm">(b)</span><p><span class="cl">Question (R. Yirmeyah):</span> Does this refer to the majority of the height, or the majority of the circumference?</p></div>
<div class="indent2"><span class="nm">1.</span><p>This question is unresolved.</p></div>
<div class="indent1"><span class="nm">(c)</span><p><span class="cl">(Shmuel):</span> (A problem in) the flesh covering the majority of the Keres is Tereifah.</p></div>
<div class="indent1"><span class="nm">(d)</span><p><span class="cl">Question (Rav Ashi):</span> Does he refer to the flesh being torn, or missing?</p></div>
<div class="indent2"><span class="nm">1.</span><p><span class="cl">Suggestion:</span> We can learn from our Mishnah.</p></div>
<div class="indent3"><span class="nm">i.</span><p><span class="cl">(Mishnah):</span> If the majority of the outer Keres was torn (it is Tereifah.)</p></div>
<div class="indent3"><span class="nm">ii.</span><p><span class="cl">(R. Yosi bar Chanina):</span> The outer Keres is the flesh covering the majority of the Keres. (Shmuel explains the Mishnah. He means that it was torn.)</p></div>
<div class="indent2"><span class="nm">2.</span><p><span class="cl">Rejection:</span> No, Shmuel explains the Mishnah differently!</p></div>
<div class="indent3"><span class="nm">i.</span><p><span class="cl">(R. Yakov bar Nachmani citing Shmuel):</span> The outer Keres is the part without hair.</p></div>
<div class="indent2"><span class="nm">3.</span><p>(Here, Shmuel teaches a Tereifah not explicit in the Mishnah. We do not resolve our question.)</p></div>
<div class="subject"><span class="nm">4)</span><p>DERISAH</p></div>
<div class="indent1"><span class="nm">(a)</span><p><span class="cl">(Mishnah):</span> An animal Nidras (clawed and poisoned) by a wolf (is Tereifah).</p></div>
<div class="indent1"><span class="nm">(b)</span><p><span class="cl">(Rav):</span> A (venomous) animal at least as large as a wolf is Matrif (makes Tereifah through Derisah) an animal. A bird at least as large as a Netz (small hawk or cuckoo?) is Matrif a bird.</p></div>
<div class="indent1"><span class="nm">(c)</span><p><span class="cl">Question:</span> What does Rav exclude?</p></div>
<div class="indent2"><span class="nm">1.</span><p><span class="cl">Suggestion:</span> He excludes something Nidras by a cat.</p></div>
<div class="indent2"><span class="nm">2.</span><p><span class="cl">Rejection:</span> We already know this. The Mishnah teaches something Nidras by a wolf. (This implies that smaller animals are not Matrif!</p></div>
<div class="indent2"><span class="nm">3.</span><p><span class="cl">Suggestion:</span> Perhaps the Mishnah teaches that a wolf is Matrif even a large animal (but animals smaller than a wolf can be Matrif small animals.)</p></div>
<div class="indent2"><span class="nm">4.</span><p><span class="cl">Rejection (Mishnah - R. Yehudah):</span> A wolf is Matrif small animals. A lion is Matrif large animals (but a wolf is not).</p></div>
<div class="indent2"><span class="nm">5.</span><p><span class="cl">Suggestion:</span> That is R. Yehudah's opinion. The first Tana holds that a wolf is Matrif even large animals!</p></div>
<div class="indent2"><span class="nm">6.</span><p><span class="cl">Rejection:</span> R. Binyamin bar Yefet taught that R. Yehudah explains the first Tana.</p></div>
<div class="indent1"><span class="nm">(d)</span><p><span class="cl">Answer #1:</span> Rav argues with R. Binyamin. He says that R. Yehudah argues with the first Tana.</p></div>
<div class="indent1"><span class="nm">(e)</span><p><span class="cl">Answer #2:</span> Indeed, the Mishnah teaches a wolf to exclude a cat;</p></div>
<div class="indent2"><span class="nm">1.</span><p>Rav needed to teach this, lest we think that the Mishnah discusses a wolf because it is common.</p></div>
<div class="indent1"><span class="nm">(f)</span><p><span class="cl">(Rav Amram citing Rav Chisda):</span> A cat or marten is Matrif a kid or lamb. A weasel is Matrif a bird.</p></div>
<div class="indent1"><span class="nm">(g)</span><p><span class="cl">Question (Beraisa):</span> A cat, Netz or marten is not Matrif, unless an interior organ was punctured. (If not, the venom will not kill it.)</p></div>
<div class="indent2"><span class="nm">1.</span><p><span class="cl">Counter-question:</span> Our Mishnah says that a Netz is Matrif!</p></div>
<div class="indent2"><span class="nm">2.</span><p><span class="cl">Answer:</span> A Netz is Matrif birds, but not kids or lambs.</p></div>
<div class="indent2"><span class="nm">3.</span><p>The question against Rav Chisda remains.</p></div>
<div class="indent1"><span class="nm">(h)</span><p><span class="cl">Version #1 - Answer:</span> Rav Chisda holds like Beribi.</p></div>
<div class="indent2"><span class="nm">1.</span><p><span class="cl">(Beraisa - Beribi):</span> A cat is not Matrif when no one saves its prey, but if someone saves its prey, it is Matrif.</p></div>

<div class="indent3"><span class="nm">i.</span><p>A cat was chasing a chicken in Rav Kahana's house. The chicken closed a door in front of the cat. The cat clawed the door. Blood exuded from all five claws. (This shows that it has venom!)</p></div>

<div class="indent2"><span class="nm">4.</span><p>Chachamim agree that it exudes venom (in such situations), but they say that it is not Matrif.</p></div>
