<p class="dedicationbox">CHULIN 31-43 - Two weeks of study material have been dedicated by Mrs. Estanne Abraham Fawer to honor the Yahrzeit of her father, Rav Mordechai ben Eliezer Zvi (Rabbi Morton Weiner) Z'L, who passed away on 18 Teves 5760. May the merit of supporting and advancing Dafyomi study -- which was so important to him -- during the weeks of his Yahrzeit serve as an Iluy for his Neshamah. </p>

<div class="subject"><span class="nm">1)</span><p>WHICH BLOOD IS MACHSHIR?</p></div>
<div class="indent1"><span class="nm">(a)</span><p><span class="cl">(Beraisa - Tana d'Vei R. Yishmael):</span> "He will drink the blood of corpses" excludes blood that flows (from a dying animal), which is not Machshir.</p></div>
<div class="indent1"><span class="nm">(b)</span><p><span class="cl">(Beraisa - Rebbi):</span> If an animal was slaughtered, and some of the blood fell on a gourd, it is Huchshar;</p></div>
<div class="indent1"><span class="nm">(c)</span><p>R. Chiya says, Tolin (we suspend. This will be explained.)</p></div>
<div class="indent1"><span class="nm">(d)</span><p><span class="cl">(R. Oshaya):</span> Since Rebbi and R. Chiya argue, we join R. Shimon's opinion that blood is not Machshir, and this is the majority ruling.</p></div>
<div class="indent1"><span class="nm">(e)</span><p><span class="cl">(Rav Papa):</span> Rebbi and R. Chiya agree that if the blood is still on the gourd at the end of Shechitah, it is Huchshar;</p></div>
<div class="indent2"><span class="nm">1.</span><p>They argue in a case that the blood was cleaned off before the second Siman was cut.</p></div>
<div class="indent2"><span class="nm">2.</span><p>Rebbi holds that Shechitah begins from the first incision. All blood that comes out is blood of Shechitah;</p></div>
<div class="indent2"><span class="nm">3.</span><p>R. Chiya holds that Shechitah is only the moment when it is completed. Before this, all blood (e.g. that fell on the gourd) is like blood of a wound, which is not Machshir. When Shechitah is completed, the blood (that already came out) is considered blood of Shechitah;</p></div>
<div class="indent3"><span class="nm">i.</span><p>'Tolin' means that we suspend the law of the gourd until the end of Shechitah. If blood is still on the gourd, it is Huchshar.</p></div>
<div class="indent1"><span class="nm">(f)</span><p><span class="cl">Question:</span> Why did R. Oshaya say that that we join R. Shimon's opinion to R. Chiya's? R. Chiya says that the blood is Machshir, and R. Shimon says that it is not!</p></div>
<div class="indent1"><span class="nm">(g)</span><p><span class="cl">Answer:</span> If the blood was cleaned off the gourd before completion of the Shechitah, they agree that it was not Huchshar. Therefore, the Halachah follows them against Rebbi.</p></div>
<div class="indent1"><span class="nm">(h)</span><p><span class="cl">(Rav Ashi):</span> 'Tolin' implies that we will never resolve the doubt;</p></div>
<div class="indent2"><span class="nm">1.</span><p>R. Chiya is unsure what the law is when the blood is cleaned off before Shechitah is finished. He is unsure when Shechitah begins.</p></div>
<div class="indent2"><span class="nm">2.</span><p>'Tolin' means that we neither eat nor burn the gourd (if it is Terumah, and it touched something Tamei).</p></div>
<div class="indent1"><span class="nm">(i)</span><p><span class="cl">Question:</span> Why did R. Oshaya say that we join R. Shimon's opinion to R. Chiya's? R. Chiya is in doubt, and R. Shimon says that the blood is not Machshir!</p></div>
<div class="indent1"><span class="nm">(j)</span><p><span class="cl">Answer:</span> Both agree that we do not burn the gourd. They are a majority against Rebbi. In such a case, Tolin. We neither eat nor burn it.</p></div>
<div class="subject"><span class="nm">2)</span><p>ISCHIBAS HA'KODESH FULLY MACHSHIR?</p></div>
<div class="indent1"><span class="nm">(a)</span><p><span class="cl">Question (Reish Lakish):</span> If (Rashi - part of) a Minchah (flour-offering) was never kneaded with oil (so it was not Huchshar) - if it becomes Tamei, can it make other foods Tamei?</p></div>
<div class="indent2"><span class="nm">1.</span><p>Is Chibas ha'Kodesh (a stringency of Kodshim that is Machshir Kodesh without any liquid) Machshir only to become Pasul, or is it Machshir even to become Tamei (to be Metamei other foods), like regular Hechsher?</p></div>
<div class="indent1"><span class="nm">(b)</span><p><span class="cl">Answer #1 (R. Elazar - Beraisa):</span> "Any food that will be eaten (upon which water will come)" - only food that water comes upon is Huchshar.</p></div>
<div class="indent2"><span class="nm">1.</span><p><span class="cl">Question:</span> Reish Lakish agrees that only water (or other drinks) are Machshir (Chulin). He asks only whether Chibas ha'Kodesh is like water falling on the Kodesh!</p></div>
<div class="indent2"><span class="nm">2.</span><p><span class="cl">Answer:</span> R. Elazar knew that. The Beraisa teaches that Chibas ha'Kodesh is not like water falling on the Kodesh,</p></div>
<div class="indent3"><span class="nm">i.</span><p>We learn Hechsher from "when water will be put upon seeds";</p></div>
<div class="indent3"><span class="nm">ii.</span><p><span class="cl">Question:</span> Why must it say also "of any food that is eaten"?</p></div>
<div class="bbbline">36b----------------------------------------36b</p></div>
<div class="indent3"><span class="nm">iii.</span><p><span class="cl">Suggestion:</span> This excludes Chibas ha'Kodesh, i.e. it is not like water falling on the Kodesh.</p></div>
<div class="indent1"><span class="nm">(c)</span><p><span class="cl">Rejection:</span> No. One verse teaches about Tum'as Mes (it applies only after Hechsher), and the other teaches (the same) about Tum'as Sheratzim;</p></div>
<div class="indent2"><span class="nm">1.</span><p>Had the Torah written only one source, to teach about Tum'as Mes, one might have thought that no Hechsher is needed for Tum'as Sheratzim, since it is stringent (even a lentil's size of a Sheretz is Metamei);</p></div>
<div class="indent2"><span class="nm">2.</span><p>Had the Torah written only one source, to teach about Tum'as Sheratzim, one might have thought that no Hechsher is needed for Tum'as Mes, since it is stringent (it is Metamei for seven days).</p></div>
<div class="indent2"><span class="nm">3.</span><p>Therefore, neither verse is free to exclude Chibas ha'Kodesh.</p></div>
<div class="indent1"><span class="nm">(d)</span><p><span class="cl">Objection (against R. Elazar, and Answer #2 - Rav Yosef - Mishnah - R. Shimon):</span> The meat is Huchshar through the Shechitah.</p></div>
<div class="indent2"><span class="nm">1.</span><p>The Hechsher is even to be Metamei other foods, even though water never came upon the meat. (The same applies to Chibas ha'Kodesh!)</p></div>
<div class="indent1"><span class="nm">(e)</span><p><span class="cl">Answer (Abaye):</span> (Reish Lakish's question and R. Elazar's answer discuss Torah law.) The Mishnah teaches that mid'Rabanan, Chibas ha'Kodesh is like water falling on the Kodesh.</p></div>
<div class="indent1"><span class="nm">(f)</span><p><span class="cl">Question (R. Zeira - Beraisa - Shamai):</span> If one picks grapes to make wine, they are Huchshar (even though he is unhappy about the juice that comes out, for it is lost);</p></div>
<div class="indent2"><span class="nm">1.</span><p>Hillel says, they are not Huchshar. Hillel later retracted and agreed with Shamai.</p></div>
<div class="indent2"><span class="nm">2.</span><p>The Hechsher is even to be Metamei other foods, even though he never wanted liquid to fall on the grapes. (The same applies to Chibas ha'Kodesh!)</p></div>
<div class="indent1"><span class="nm">(g)</span><p><span class="cl">Answer (Abaye):</span> Mid'Rabanan, Chibas ha'Kodesh is like water falling on the Kodesh.</p></div>
<div class="indent1"><span class="nm">(h)</span><p><span class="cl">Objection (Rav Yosef):</span> To answer R. Zeira and myself, you said that mid'Rabanan, it is as if water came upon them. Reish Lakish asked if mid'Rabanan, it is as if water came upon the Kodesh!</p></div>
<div class="indent1"><span class="nm">(i)</span><p><span class="cl">Answer (Abaye):</span> If it were only mid'Rabanan, we would not burn Terumah or Kodshim that touched the meat, just we would not eat it. Do you really think that Reish Lakish asked about this?! (Surely, he knew that we do not eat it!)</p></div>
<div class="indent2"><span class="nm">1.</span><p>Rather, he asked whether we burn what touches the meat. He is unsure whether mid'Oraisa, it is as if water came upon the Kodesh!</p></div>
<div class="subject"><span class="nm">3)</span><p>THE SOURCE FOR CHIBAS HA'KODESH</p></div>
<div class="indent1"><span class="nm">(a)</span><p><span class="cl">Question:</span> If Chibas ha'Kodesh is mid'Oraisa, what is the source for it?</p></div>
<div class="indent1"><span class="nm">(b)</span><p><span class="cl">Suggestion:</span> "(Kodesh) meat that will touch anything Tamei (may not be eaten)" teaches that meat of Korbanos is Huchshar.</p></div>
<div class="indent2"><span class="nm">1.</span><p><span class="cl">Question:</span> How did it become Huchshar?</p></div>
<div class="indent3"><span class="nm">i.</span><p><span class="cl">Suggestion:</span> It became Huchshar through its blood.</p></div>
<div class="indent3"><span class="nm">ii.</span><p><span class="cl">Rejection:</span> R. Chiya bar Aba expounded "you will pour it (the blood) on the ground like water" - only water that is poured on the ground is Machshir. (This excludes blood of Korbanos, which is collected in a Kli.)</p></div>
<div class="indent2"><span class="nm">2.</span><p><span class="cl">Answer #1:</span> It became Huchshar through liquids of the Mitbach (the place in the Mikdash where the meat is rinsed).</p></div>
<div class="indent2"><span class="nm">3.</span><p><span class="cl">Rejection:</span> R. Yosi bar Chanina taught that liquids in the Mitbach are Tehorim (do not become Tamei). Further, they are not even Machshir!</p></div>
<div class="indent3"><span class="nm">i.</span><p><span class="cl">Suggestion:</span> Perhaps he taught only about blood of the Mitbach (but not the other liquids).</p></div>
<div class="indent3"><span class="nm">ii.</span><p><span class="cl">Rejection:</span> He said, the liquids (are Tehorim)!</p></div>
<div class="indent2"><span class="nm">4.</span><p><span class="cl">Answer #2:</span> The meat is Huchshar through Chibas ha'Kodesh.</p></div>
<div class="indent1"><span class="nm">(c)</span><p><span class="cl">Rejection:</span> Perhaps the Hechsher was (not through Chibas ha'Kodesh, rather,) like Rav Yehudah established;</p></div>
<div class="indent2"><span class="nm">1.</span><p><span class="cl">(Rav Yehudah):</span> The Korban was taken through a river, and it was still wet when it was slaughtered.</p></div>
<div class="indent1"><span class="nm">(d)</span><p><span class="cl">Answer:</span> We learn Chibas ha'Kodesh from the end of the verse. "And the meat" includes wood and frankincense (they can become Tamei).</p></div>
<div class="indent2"><span class="nm">1.</span><p><span class="cl">Question:</span> These are not foods!</p></div>
<div class="indent2"><span class="nm">2.</span><p><span class="cl">Answer:</span> Due to Chibas ha'Kodesh, they are considered foods, and they are Mekabel Tum'ah. Likewise, Chibas ha'Kodesh is Machshir Kodesh meat without a liquid!</p></div>
