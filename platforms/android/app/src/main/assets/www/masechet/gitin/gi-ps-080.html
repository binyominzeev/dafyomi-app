<p class="bas subject"><span class="nm">1)</span>IMPROPER <i>GITIN</i></p>
<p class="bas indent1"><span class="nm">(a)</span>If the scribe changed his or her name, or the name of his or her city, all these penalties apply.</p>
<p class="bas indent1"><span class="nm">(b)</span>A man died without children. One of his wives (Leah) was Ervah (a close relative) to the Yavam, which exempts herself and all Tzaros (co-wives) from Yibum and Chalitzah. If Sarah (a Tzarah) remarried, and then we learned that Leah is an Ailonis (so she was never really married, and Sarah was forbidden to remarry without Chalitzah), all of the above fines apply to Sarah. (Fines that pertain to the first husband, e.g. she may not be married to him, apply to the Yavam.)</p>
<p class="bas indent1"><span class="nm">(c)</span>A man died without children. One of the widows (Leah) did Yibum. (This exempts the other Tzaros from Yibum and Chalitzah.) If Sarah (a Tzarah) remarried, and then we learned that Leah is an Ailonis (so the Yibum was Pasul, and Sarah was forbidden to remarry without Chalitzah), all of the above fines apply to Sarah.</p>
<p class="bas indent1"><span class="nm">(d)</span>A scribe wrote a Get for a man and a receipt (saying that the Kesuvah has been paid) for his wife. The man divorced his wife and took the receipt; she remarried. Later, he finds that he has the Get, and she has the receipt. We realize that the scribe gave the wrong document to each party, so she was never divorced! All the above fines apply;</p>
<p class="bas indent1"><span class="nm">(e)</span>R. Eliezer says, this is only if the mistake is realized immediately. If not, the man is not believed to forbid her to her second husband.</p>
<p class="bas indent1"><span class="nm">(f)</span><span class="cl">(Gemara):</span> 'An improper kingdom' refers to Rome;</p>
<p class="bas indent2"><span class="nm">1.</span>It is called 'improper' because it does not have its own alphabet or language.</p>
<p class="bas subject"><span class="nm">2)</span>R. MEIR'S OPINION ABOUT <i>GITIN</i></p>
<p class="bas indent1"><span class="nm">(a)</span><span class="cl">(Ula):</span> It was enacted to date a Get according to the kingdom for the sake of Shalom with the king.</p>
<p class="bas indent1"><span class="nm">(b)</span><span class="cl">Question:</span> If that is the reason, if this was not done, why must she leave her new husband and the children be Mamzerim?!</p>
<p class="bas indent1"><span class="nm">(c)</span><span class="cl">Answer:</span> Yes! This is R. Meir's opinion;</p>
<p class="bas indent2"><span class="nm">1.</span><span class="cl">(Rav Hamnuna):</span> R. Meir holds that any deviation from the enactments of Chachamim in Gitin disqualifies the Get, and the children (from the new husband) are Mamzerim.</p>
<p class="bas indent1"><span class="nm">(d)</span><span class="cl">(Mishnah):</span> If it was dated according to the kingdom of Yavan...</p>
<p class="bas indent1"><span class="nm">(e)</span>It was necessary to teach the different cases.</p>
<p class="bas indent2"><span class="nm">1.</span>Had it taught only about Rome, one might have thought that other kings resent a Get dated according to Rome because the Romans currently rule;</p>
<p class="bas indent3"><span class="nm">i.</span>This would not apply to Yavan or the Medes.</p>
<p class="bas indent2"><span class="nm">2.</span>Had it taught only about Yavan, one might have thought that other kings resent such a Get because Yavan once ruled;</p>
<p class="bas indent3"><span class="nm">i.</span>This would not apply to the building of the Beis ha'Mikdash.</p>
<p class="bas indent2"><span class="nm">3.</span>Had it taught only about the building of the Beis ha'Mikdash was taught, one might have thought that other kings resent this because we mention our praise;</p>
<p class="bas indent3"><span class="nm">i.</span>This would not apply to the destruction of the Beis ha'Mikdash, for this is our sorrow;</p>
<p class="bas indent2"><span class="nm">4.</span>The Mishnah teaches that this is not so. The Get is Pasul in all these cases.</p>
<p class="bas indent1"><span class="nm">(f)</span><span class="cl">(Mishnah):</span> He was in the east, but the Get says 'in the west,'</p>
<p class="bas indent1"><span class="nm">(g)</span><span class="cl">Question:</span> Who was in the east?</p>
<p class="bas indent2"><span class="nm">1.</span><span class="cl">Suggestion:</span> The husband was in the east.</p>
<p class="bas indent2"><span class="nm">2.</span><span class="cl">Rejection:</span> The next clause teaches this - 'the name of the husband or wife, or the name of his or her city was changed'!</p>
<p class="bas indent1"><span class="nm">(h)</span><span class="cl">Answer:</span> Rather, the scribe was in the east.</p>
<p class="bas indent2"><span class="nm">1.</span>Rav Huna would tell scribes to write the location they are in, not where they were commanded to write the Get.</p>
<p class="bas indent1"><span class="nm">(i)</span><span class="cl">(Rav Yehudah):</span> Our Mishnah is like R. Meir (who is concerned for Shalom with the kingdom). Chachamim say, even if the Get was dated according to a minor city official (who keeps track of boundaries of people's inheritances), she is divorced.</p>
<p class="bas bbbline">80b----------------------------------------80b</p>
<p class="bas indent1"><span class="nm">(j)</span><span class="cl">Question (Rav Nachman bar Rav Chisda):</span> If a Get was dated according to a servant of the king in Buscar, what is the law?</p>
<p class="bas indent1"><span class="nm">(k)</span><span class="cl">Answer (Rabah):</span> Even R. Meir admits that in such a case she is divorced, since the servant is part of the same kingdom.</p>
<p class="bas indent1"><span class="nm">(l)</span><span class="cl">Question:</span> Why is this different than dating according to a minor city official?</p>
<p class="bas indent1"><span class="nm">(m)</span><span class="cl">Answer:</span> There, it is a disgrace. Here, it honors the kingdom.</p>
<p class="bas indent1"><span class="nm">(n)</span><span class="cl">(R. Aba):</span> Our Mishnah is like R. Meir. Chachamim say that the children are not Mamzerim;</p>
<p class="bas indent2"><span class="nm">1.</span>Chachamim admit to R. Meir that if the name of the husband or wife, or the name of his or her city was changed, the children are Mamzerim.</p>
<p class="bas indent2"><span class="nm">2.</span><span class="cl">Support (Rav Ashi - Mishnah):</span> If the name of the husband or wife, or the name of his or her city was changed, all the fines apply.</p>
<p class="bas indent2"><span class="nm">3.</span><span class="cl">Question:</span> Who taught this clause?</p>
<p class="bas indent3"><span class="nm">i.</span>If R. Meir taught it, he should have taught it together with the previous case (since the law is the same)!</p>
<p class="bas indent2"><span class="nm">4.</span><span class="cl">Answer:</span> Rather, Chachamim taught it.</p>
<p class="bas subject"><span class="nm">3)</span>THE OTHER FINES</p>
<p class="bas indent1"><span class="nm">(a)</span><span class="cl">(Mishnah):</span> If a man died without children (and Sarah remarried because Leah was Ervah to the Yavam, and Leah was found to be an Ailonis, all the fines apply).</p>
<p class="bas indent1"><span class="nm">(b)</span><span class="cl">Version #1 (Inference):</span> The fines apply when Sarah remarried, but if she was Mezanah, she is not fined.</p>
<p class="bas indent1"><span class="nm">(c)</span><span class="cl">Suggestion:</span> This refutes Rav Hamnuna!</p>
<p class="bas indent2"><span class="nm">1.</span><span class="cl">(Rav Hamnuna):</span> If a Shomeres Yavam had Bi'ah with a stranger, she is forbidden to the Yavam.</p>
<p class="bas indent1"><span class="nm">(d)</span><span class="cl">Rejection:</span> No, the fines apply whether she married or was Mezanah. The Tana discusses marriage, for this is nicer.</p>
<p class="bas indent1"><span class="nm">(e)</span><span class="cl">Version #2:</span> The Mishnah discusses when Sarah remarried. The same applies if she was Mezanah.</p>
<p class="bas indent1"><span class="nm">(f)</span><span class="cl">Suggestion:</span> This supports Rav Hamnuna.</p>
<p class="bas indent2"><span class="nm">1.</span><span class="cl">(Rav Hamnuna):</span> If a Shomeres Yavam had Bi'ah with a stranger, she is forbidden to the Yavam.</p>
<p class="bas indent1"><span class="nm">(g)</span><span class="cl">Rejection:</span> No, the fines apply only when she remarried, for then she could be confused with a woman who remarried after hearing (false testimony) that her husband died overseas. (end of Version #2)</p>
<p class="bas indent1"><span class="nm">(h)</span><span class="cl">(Mishnah):</span> If Leah did Yibum (and Sarah remarried ...), all of the above fines apply to Sarah.</p>
<p class="bas indent1"><span class="nm">(i)</span>It was necessary to teach this case and the previous case.</p>
<p class="bas indent2"><span class="nm">1.</span>Had we taught only the first case, one might have thought that only there she is fined since Yibum was never done; but here Yibum was done, so she would not be fined;</p>
<p class="bas indent2"><span class="nm">2.</span>Had we taught only this case, one might have thought that only here she is fined because she knew that she fell to Yibum, but in the first case she thought that she was exempt from the moment her husband died, so she would not be fined.</p>
<p class="bas indent1"><span class="nm">(j)</span><span class="cl">(Mishnah):</span> If the scribe erred... R. Eliezer says, if the mistake is realized immediately...</p>
<p class="bas indent1"><span class="nm">(k)</span><span class="cl">Question:</span> What is considered immediately?</p>
<p class="bas indent1"><span class="nm">(l)</span><span class="cl">Answer #1 (Rav Yehudah):</span> The whole time they are involved in the divorce is called immediately. After they divert to another matter is considered 'later.'</p>
<p class="bas indent1"><span class="nm">(m)</span><span class="cl">Answer #2 (Rav Ada bar Ahavah):</span> If she did not yet remarry, that is immediately. After remarriage is considered 'later'.</p>
<p class="bas indent1"><span class="nm">(n)</span><span class="cl">(Mishnah):</span> He cannot forbid her to her second husband.</p>
<p class="bas indent2"><span class="nm">1.</span>This is like Rav Ada bar Ahavah. He is not believed only if she remarried.</p>
<p class="bas indent2"><span class="nm">2.</span><span class="cl">Question:</span> According to Shmuel, her husband is not believed even if she did not remarry!</p>
<p class="bas indent2"><span class="nm">3.</span><span class="cl">Answer:</span> The Mishnah means that he cannot uproot her permission to marry a second husband.</p>
