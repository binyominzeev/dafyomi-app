<p class="bas subject"><span class="nm">1)</span>UNCHECKED DAYS IN THE MIDDLE (cont.)</p>
<p class="bas indent1"><span class="nm">(a)</span><span class="cl">Question:</span> If a Zav and Zavah checked themselves only on days one and eight, and found themselves to be Tehorim, what is the law according to R. Eliezer?</p>
<p class="bas indent2"><span class="nm">1.</span>Does he require checking at the beginning and end (of the seven clean days)? Here the beginning was checked, but not the end;</p>
<p class="bas indent2"><span class="nm">2.</span>Or, perhaps it suffices to check at the beginning alone?</p>
<p class="bas indent1"><span class="nm">(b)</span><span class="cl">Answer #1 (Rav):</span> Here also, R. Eliezer is Metaher.</p>
<p class="bas indent1"><span class="nm">(c)</span><span class="cl">Answer #2 (R. Chanina):</span> He requires the beginning and end. The end is missing. (They must start again and count six more days.)</p>
<p class="bas indent1"><span class="nm">(d)</span><span class="cl">Question (against Rav - Beraisa):</span> They agree that if a Zav and Zavah checked only on days one and eight, and found themselves to be Tehorim, only day eight counts. (They must count six more days/)</p>
<p class="bas indent2"><span class="nm">1.</span><span class="cl">Suggestion:</span> R. Eliezer and R. Yehoshua agree about this!</p>
<p class="bas indent1"><span class="nm">(e)</span><span class="cl">Answer:</span> No, R. Yehoshua and R. Akiva agree about this.</p>
<p class="bas indent1"><span class="nm">(f)</span><span class="cl">(Rav Sheshes citing R. Yirmeyah bar Aba citing Rav):</span> If a Nidah was Mafrish on the third day, she counts it towards seven clean days.</p>
<p class="bas indent1"><span class="nm">(g)</span><span class="cl">Objection:</span> A Nidah does not need to count clean days!</p>
<p class="bas indent1"><span class="nm">(h)</span><span class="cl">Correction:</span> Rather, if a Zavah was Mafrish on the third day (of seeing Dam Zivah), she counts it towards seven clean days.</p>
<p class="bas indent1"><span class="nm">(i)</span><span class="cl">Question (Rav Sheshes):</span> (The Kusim say this!) Does Rav hold like the Kusim?!</p>
<p class="bas indent1"><span class="nm">(j)</span><span class="cl">Answer (R. Yirmeyah bar Aba):</span> He means that she may count the days after the third day.</p>
<p class="bas indent1"><span class="nm">(k)</span><span class="cl">Objection:</span> This is obvious!</p>
<p class="bas indent1"><span class="nm">(l)</span><span class="cl">Answer:</span> The case is, she did not check again until the seventh (clean) day;</p>
<p class="bas indent2"><span class="nm">1.</span>Above, Rav taught that it suffices to check at the beginning alone. Here, he teaches that also the end alone suffices. (Hafrashah is required, but it was on day three of Zivah, which does not count towards the seven clean days.)</p>
<p class="bas indent2"><span class="nm">2.</span>One might have thought that the beginning suffices, for then she is Muchzekes Tehorah, but the end does not suffice. Rav teaches that this is not so.</p>
<p class="bas indent1"><span class="nm">(m)</span><span class="cl">Ravin:</span> R. Yosi b'Rebbi Chanina challenged Rav from the Beraisa of To'eh (29b, a woman who immerses 95 times because she does not know when she gave birth. The Tana holds that it is a Mitzvah to immerse at the first opportunity.) I do not understand his question!</p>
<p class="bas indent2"><span class="nm">1.</span><span class="cl">Question (R. Yosi b'Rebbi Chanina):</span> We hold that during the first week (after consulting with Beis Din) she immerses each night, but not during the days;</p>
<p class="bas indent3"><span class="nm">i.</span>If the beginning is not essential, she should (check each day and) immerse also during the day. Perhaps she was Yoledes b'Zov, and today she finished seven clean days! (Ramban - even though Hafrashah is required, birth is like Hafrashah, for surely she ceased to see Dam Zivah.)</p>
<p class="bas indent3"><span class="nm">ii.</span>Rather, we must say that because she did not check the first day, she may not immerse.</p>
<p class="bas indent2"><span class="nm">2.</span><span class="cl">Answer (Ravin):</span> We established the Beraisa to be like R. Akiva, who requires counting the (seven clean) days "in front of us" (according to Beis Din, i.e. checking each day. Chachamim do not require this. They would require her to immerse also during the days.)</p>
<p class="bas subject"><span class="nm">2)</span>THE OPINION OF CHACHAMIM</p>
<p class="bas indent1"><span class="nm">(a)</span><span class="cl">Question:</span> What is the source that Chachamim do not require counting (the first six) days in front of us?</p>
<p class="bas indent1"><span class="nm">(b)</span><span class="cl">Answer (Beraisa):</span> If a woman says "I saw blood one day" (she does not know when), she immerses nine times. Seven are due to Nidah. (Any of the next seven nights could complete the seven days of Nidah), and two (during the day) due to Zavah (Shomeres Yom k'Neged Yom, today or tomorrow could be the Yom Shimur);</p>
<p class="bas indent2"><span class="nm">1.</span>If she says "I saw blood (once) Bein ha'Shemashos," she immerses 11 times.</p>
<p class="bas indent2"><span class="nm">2.</span><span class="cl">Question:</span> Why does she immerse 11 times? (Also in the previous clause, we did not know if she saw by day or at night! Even if the sighting counts like two, e.g. it spanned two days, this would not require another immersion.)</p>
<p class="bas indent2"><span class="nm">3.</span><span class="cl">Answer (R. Yirmeyah mi'Difti):</span> The case is, she comes in front of us Bein ha'Shemashos. (Tosfos ha'Rosh - she need not say that the sighting was Bein ha'Shemashos);</p>
<p class="bas indent2"><span class="nm">4.</span>Eight Tevilos are due to Nidah..(She immerses tonight and seven more nights. If she saw just now, and it was already night, she may not immerse until night eight), three are due to Zavah (right now, lest it is still day and today is Yom Shimur for yesterday), tomorrow (perhaps she saw today) and the third day. (Perhaps she saw now, and it was already night.)</p>
<p class="bas indent2"><span class="nm">5.</span><span class="cl">(Continuation of Beraisa):</span> If she says "I did not see," she immerses 15 times.</p>
<p class="bas indent2"><span class="nm">6.</span><span class="cl">Objection (Rava):</span> This is absurd, like the laws in Galchi (a place)!</p>
<p class="bas indent3"><span class="nm">i.</span>There, one who owns an ox must watch all the oxen (of the city) for one day. One who does not own an ox must guard for two days.</p>
<p class="bas indent3"><span class="nm">ii.</span>An orphan was there. They gave him the cattle to guard. He slaughtered them, and announced that whoever owned cattle receives one skin, and those who did not own receive two skins each.</p>
<p class="bas indent3"><span class="nm">iii.</span><span class="cl">The residents:</span> That is unreasonable!</p>
<p class="bas indent3"><span class="nm">iv.</span><span class="cl">The orphan:</span> It is just like your law of guarding. One who did not own is obligated more. Likewise he will receive more!</p>
<p class="bas indent3"><span class="nm">v.</span>Here also, if one who saw immerses only nine or 11 times, it is unreasonable that one who did not see immerses 15 times!</p>
<p class="bas indent2"><span class="nm">7.</span><span class="cl">Correction:</span> Rather, if she says, "I do not know how many times I saw, nor whether it was during the days of Nidah or of Zivah," she immerses 15 times:</p>
<p class="bas indent3"><span class="nm">i.</span>If she says this during the day, she immerses seven times due to Nidah (like above (b)) and eight in case she was a (full) Zavah. (Today or any of the next seven days could complete seven clean days. Tevilah today and tomorrow are included, in case she is Shomeres Yom k'Neged Yom);</p>
<p class="bas bbbline">69b----------------------------------------69b</p>
<p class="bas indent3"><span class="nm">ii.</span>If she tells us at night, she immerses eight times for Nidah (like b:4) and seven for Zavah. (This will be corrected.)</p>
<p class="bas indent2"><span class="nm">8.</span><span class="cl">Objection:</span> She should need to immerse eight times due to Zavah (just like when she told us during the day! Perhaps today completes seven clean days. If she saw tonight, her seven clean days will end seven days after today!)</p>
<p class="bas indent2"><span class="nm">9.</span><span class="cl">Correction:</span> Rather, in either case, she immerses seven times for Nidah and eight for Zavah.</p>
<p class="bas indent2"><span class="nm">10.</span><span class="cl">Question:</span> If she tells us at night, she must immerse eight times for Nidah!</p>
<p class="bas indent2"><span class="nm">11.</span><span class="cl">Answer:</span> The Tana counts eight for Zavah, for this is required in any case. He counts only seven for Nidah, for sometimes (i.e. if she tells us during the day) only seven are needed.</p>
<p class="bas indent2"><span class="nm">12.</span><span class="cl">Summation of answer (b):</span> If she must count in front of us, she would not immerse during the day (for Zavah, for she was not counting)! She would start counting today, and immerse after seven days!</p>
<p class="bas indent2"><span class="nm">13.</span><span class="cl">Conclusion:</span> Chachamim do not require counting the days.</p>
<p class="bas indent1"><span class="nm">(c)</span><span class="cl">Rejection (Rav Acha brei d'Rav Yosef):</span> Because of objection (b:6) we amended the Beraisa. If we amend it differently, the proof goes away!</p>
<p class="bas indent2"><span class="nm">1.</span>Rather, if she says "I counted, but I do not know how many days I counted, nor whether it was during the days of Nidah or of Zivah," she immerses 15 times.</p>
<p class="bas indent2"><span class="nm">2.</span><span class="cl">Objection:</span> "I counted" implies that she counted at least one day. If so, she must count at most six more. She need not immerse on day eight!</p>
<p class="bas indent2"><span class="nm">3.</span><span class="cl">Correction:</span> Rather, she says "I do not know whether or not I counted, or how many days I counted..."</p>
<p class="bas subject"><span class="nm">3)</span>POSTHUMOUS <i>TUM'AH</i></p>
<p class="bas indent1"><span class="nm">(a)</span><span class="cl">(Mishnah):</span> If any of the following died, the body has Tum'as Masa until the flesh rots: a Zav, Zavah, Nidah, Yoledes or Metzora;</p>
<p class="bas indent1"><span class="nm">(b)</span>A dead Nochri does not have Tum'as Masa.</p>
<p class="bas indent1"><span class="nm">(c)</span>Beis Shamai says, every dead woman is considered a Nidah. (Tosfos - this is even for Even Misma; see (g). Rashi - we immerse clothes that she wore shortly before death);</p>
<p class="bas indent1"><span class="nm">(d)</span>Beis Hillel says, only one who died while a Nidah is considered a Nidah after death.</p>
<p class="bas indent1"><span class="nm">(e)</span><span class="cl">(Gemara) Question:</span> To which Tum'as Masa does the Mishnah refer?</p>
<p class="bas indent2"><span class="nm">1.</span>It cannot mean regular Tum'as Masa. Every Mes has that!</p>
<p class="bas indent1"><span class="nm">(f)</span><span class="cl">Answer:</span> It refers to Even Misma (a rock too heavy to be moved, or that is supported on pegs. Normal Tum'as Masa does not apply to it. It applies only to someone Tamei due to his own body, i.e. those listed in our Mishnah) -- "v'Hesayis Even Chadah v'Sumas Al Pum Guba... ."</p>
<p class="bas indent1"><span class="nm">(g)</span><span class="cl">Question:</span> Why does Tum'as Even Misma apply to these people after death?</p>
<p class="bas indent1"><span class="nm">(h)</span><span class="cl">Answer (Rav):</span> This is a decree, lest they faint (and people will think that they are dead).</p>
<p class="bas indent1"><span class="nm">(i)</span><span class="cl">(Beraisa - R. Eliezer):</span> They are Teme'im until the stomach bursts.</p>
<p class="bas indent1"><span class="nm">(j)</span><span class="cl">(Mishnah):</span> A dead Nochri (does not have Tum'as Masa).</p>
<p class="bas indent1"><span class="nm">(k)</span><span class="cl">(Beraisa - Rebbi):</span> A dead Nochri does not have Tum'as Masa because he has no Tum'ah mid'Oraisa while alive, only mid'Rabanan.</p>
<p class="bas subject"><span class="nm">4)</span>THE ALEXANDRIAN'S QUESTIONS</p>
<p class="bas indent1"><span class="nm">(a)</span><span class="cl">(Beraisa):</span> People of Alexandria asked R. Yehoshua 12 things -- three matters of Chochmah (Halachah), three of Agadata (non-Halachic teachings), three silly matters (Maharsha - questions about the creation based on misunderstanding), and three of Derech Eretz (proper conduct).</p>
<p class="bas indent1"><span class="nm">(b)</span><span class="cl">Question #1 (of Chochmah):</span> If a Zav, Zavah, Nidah, Yoledes or Metzora died, for how long does the body have Tum'as Masa?</p>
<p class="bas indent1"><span class="nm">(c)</span><span class="cl">Answer (R. Yehoshua):</span> It is until the flesh rots.</p>
<p class="bas indent1"><span class="nm">(d)</span><span class="cl">Question #2:</span> Is the daughter of Machzir Gerushaso (one who remarried his divorcee after she married someone else) forbidden to a Kohen?</p>
<p class="bas indent2"><span class="nm">1.</span>Perhaps a Kal v'Chomer forbids her. Even though the Isur of a widow to a Kohen Gadol is Eino Shavah b'Kol (does not apply to all people), the son is tainted. (He is a Chalal, i.e. empty of Kedushas Kehunah. A daughter is a Chalalah, and forbidden to Kehunah.) Machzir Gerushaso is Shavah b'Kol (applies to all people). All the more so the child should be tainted!</p>
<p class="bas indent2"><span class="nm">2.</span>Or, perhaps we reject the Kal v'Chomer. A widow (who marries a Kohen Gadol) herself becomes blemished, but the divorcee does not!</p>
<p class="bas indent1"><span class="nm">(e)</span><span class="cl">Answer (R. Yehoshua):</span> "Hi To'evah" teaches that she (the divorcee who remarried her first husband) is an abomination, but her children are not.</p>
