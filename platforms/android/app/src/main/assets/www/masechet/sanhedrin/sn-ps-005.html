<p class="bas subject"><span class="nm">1)</span>PERMISSION TO JUDGE</p>
<p class="bas indent1"><span class="nm">(a)</span><span class="cl">(Beraisa):</span> Three judges are needed for monetary cases. A Mumcheh l'Rabim can judge alone.</p>
<p class="bas indent1"><span class="nm">(b)</span><span class="cl">Rav Nachman:</span> Someone like me can judge monetary cases alone. (R. Chiya said the same.)</p>
<p class="bas indent1"><span class="nm">(c)</span><span class="cl">Question:</span> Does he mean, because he has learned and can reason, and he has permission (from the Reish Galusa (the executive head of Yisrael in exile), but without permission, his verdict is meaningless)?</p>
<p class="bas indent2"><span class="nm">1.</span>Or, does it suffice that he learned and can reason?</p>
<p class="bas indent1"><span class="nm">(d)</span><span class="cl">Answer:</span> Once, Mar Zutra brei d'Rav Nachman judged a case and erred.</p>
<p class="bas indent2"><span class="nm">1.</span><span class="cl">Rav Yosef:</span> If the parties accepted you for a judge, you are exempt. If not, you are liable.</p>
<p class="bas indent2"><span class="nm">2.</span>This shows that even without permission, his verdict stands. (If not, there is nothing to be liable for!)</p>
<p class="bas indent1"><span class="nm">(e)</span><span class="cl">(Rav and Shmuel):</span> If someone wants to judge and be exempt if he errs, he should ask permission from the Reish Galusa.</p>
<p class="bas indent1"><span class="nm">(f)</span>The following is obvious. Permission from the Reish Galusa helps for anywhere in Bavel. Permission from the Nasi helps for anywhere in Eretz Yisrael.</p>
<p class="bas indent2"><span class="nm">1.</span>Also, permission from the Reish Galusa helps for Eretz Yisrael, for he has more authority;</p>
<p class="bas indent3"><span class="nm">i.</span><span class="cl">(Beraisa):</span> "Lo Yasur Shevet mi'Yehudah" refers to the Roshei Galuyos in Bavel, who rule Yisrael with a staff;</p>
<p class="bas indent3"><span class="nm">ii.</span>"U'Mchokek mi'Bein Raglav" refers to the (Nesi'im, the) descendants of Hillel who teach Torah to multitudes.</p>
<p class="bas indent1"><span class="nm">(g)</span><span class="cl">Question:</span> Does permission from the Nasi help in Bavel?</p>
<p class="bas indent1"><span class="nm">(h)</span><span class="cl">Answer:</span> Rabah bar Chanah erred in judgment. R. Chiya said 'if the parties accepted you for a judge, you are exempt. If not, you are liable.'</p>
<p class="bas indent2"><span class="nm">1.</span>Rabah bar Chanah had permission from the Nasi. This shows that this does not help in Bavel.</p>
<p class="bas indent1"><span class="nm">(i)</span><span class="cl">Question:</span> When Rabah bar Rav Huna had conflicts with the house of the Reish Galusa, he would say 'I did not get permission from you, rather from my father, who got permission from Rav, and he from R. Chiya, and he from Rebbi  (the Nasi)!'</p>
<p class="bas indent1"><span class="nm">(j)</span><span class="cl">Answer:</span> Such permission does not help in Bavel, but they thought it helps, therefore he said this.</p>
<p class="bas indent1"><span class="nm">(k)</span><span class="cl">Question:</span> If permission does not help, why did Rabah bar Chanah get permission?</p>
<p class="bas indent1"><span class="nm">(l)</span><span class="cl">Answer:</span> It helps for cities on the border of Bavel that conduct like Eretz Yisrael.</p>
<p class="bas subject"><span class="nm">2)</span>WHAT PERMISSION IS NEEDED FOR</p>
<p class="bas indent1"><span class="nm">(a)</span><span class="cl">Question:</span> What permission did he get?</p>
<p class="bas indent1"><span class="nm">(b)</span><span class="cl">Answer:</span> When Rabah bar Chanah was about to go to Bavel, R. Chiya told Rebbi 'my brother's son is going to Bavel.'</p>
<p class="bas indent2"><span class="nm">1.</span><span class="cl">Rebbi:</span> He may teach Halachos, judge, and permit (blemished) firstborn animals.</p>
<p class="bas indent2"><span class="nm">2.</span>When Rav was about to go to Bavel, R. Chiya told Rebbi 'my sister's son is going to Bavel.'</p>
<p class="bas indent2"><span class="nm">3.</span><span class="cl">Rebbi:</span> He may teach Halachos and judge, but he may not permit firstborn animals.</p>
<p class="bas indent1"><span class="nm">(c)</span><span class="cl">Question:</span> Why did R. Chiya call Rabah bar Chanah 'my brother's son', and Rav 'my sister's son'?</p>
<p class="bas indent2"><span class="nm">1.</span><span class="cl">Suggestion:</span> Perhaps those were their relationships to him!</p>
<p class="bas indent2"><span class="nm">2.</span><span class="cl">Rejection:</span> The sons of Aba bar Acha Karsela of Kafri were Eivo (Rav's father), Chanah, Shila, Marsa and R. Chiya (i.e. also Rav was the son of R. Chiya's brother)!</p>
<p class="bas indent1"><span class="nm">(d)</span><span class="cl">Answer #1:</span> Rav was his brother's son and also his sister's son. Rabah bar Chanah was only his brother's son.</p>
<p class="bas indent1"><span class="nm">(e)</span><span class="cl">Answer #2:</span> He called Rav 'my sister's son' due to his Chachmah - "Emor la'Chachmah Achosi At."</p>
<p class="bas bbbline">5b----------------------------------------5b</p>
<p class="bas indent1"><span class="nm">(f)</span><span class="cl">Question:</span> Why didn't Rebbi authorize Rav to permit firstborn animals?</p>
<p class="bas indent2"><span class="nm">1.</span><span class="cl">Suggestion:</span> He was not such a great Chacham.</p>
<p class="bas indent2"><span class="nm">2.</span><span class="cl">Rejection:</span> We said that he was a greater Chacham than Rabah bar Chanah!</p>
<p class="bas indent2"><span class="nm">3.</span><span class="cl">Suggestion:</span> He did not recognize blemishes well enough.</p>
<p class="bas indent2"><span class="nm">4.</span><span class="cl">Rejection:</span> Rav spent 18 months with shepherds, in order to understand which blemishes are temporary and which are permanent.</p>
<p class="bas indent1"><span class="nm">(g)</span><span class="cl">Answer #1:</span> Rebbi wanted to honor Rabah bar Chanah.</p>
<p class="bas indent1"><span class="nm">(h)</span><span class="cl">Answer #2:</span> Because Rav was so proficient, he would permit blemishes that people did not recognize, and they would extrapolate and come to permit similar blemishes which are really temporary.</p>
<p class="bas indent1"><span class="nm">(i)</span><span class="cl">Question:</span> Rebbi authorized them to teach Halachos. If they are learned, why do they need permission?</p>
<p class="bas indent1"><span class="nm">(j)</span><span class="cl">Answer:</span> This was decreed after the following episode.</p>
<p class="bas indent2"><span class="nm">1.</span>Rebbi went to a certain place. He saw that they would allow the dough to become Tamei when kneading (i.e. and the Chalah that will be separated will be Tamei, and forbidden). He asked them why they do so.</p>
<p class="bas indent2"><span class="nm">2.</span><span class="cl">The residents:</span> A Chacham came and expounded that Mei Betza'im (swamp water) does not Machshir (make food susceptible to Tum'ah).</p>
<p class="bas indent3"><span class="nm">i.</span>Really, the Chacham expounded that Mei <i>Beitzim</i> (egg whites) is not Machshir, they misunderstood.</p>
<p class="bas indent2"><span class="nm">3.</span>They also erred because they heard that water of the Karmiyon and Pugah rivers cannot be sanctified with ashes of the red heifer because it is swamp water. They assumed that likewise, it is not Machshir;</p>
<p class="bas indent3"><span class="nm">i.</span>This was wrong. It cannot be used for the red heifer, because Mayim Chayim (flowing water) must be put directly in the Kli (and the mud interrupts in between. Alternatively, these rivers do not flow so nicely, so they are not considered Chayim).</p>
<p class="bas indent3"><span class="nm">ii.</span>Any detached water is Machshir.</p>
<p class="bas indent2"><span class="nm">4.</span><span class="cl">(Beraisa):</span> At that time, they decreed that one may not teach Halachos without permission from his Rebbi.</p>
<p class="bas indent1"><span class="nm">(k)</span>Tanchum the son of R. Ami came to Chater (a place). He taught that on Pesach one may wet wheat and immediately grind it.</p>
<p class="bas indent2"><span class="nm">1.</span><span class="cl">The inhabitants:</span> Your Rebbi, R. Mani of Tzur is here;</p>
<p class="bas indent3"><span class="nm">i.</span><span class="cl">(Beraisa):</span> A Talmid may not teach Halachos within three Parsa'os of his Rebbi (the length of the encampment of Yisrael in the Midbar).</p>
<p class="bas indent2"><span class="nm">2.</span><span class="cl">Tanchum:</span> I did not know that he was here.</p>
<p class="bas indent1"><span class="nm">(l)</span><span class="cl">Version #1 (our text):</span> R. Chiya saw a man in a cemetery. He asked, isn't your father a Kohen? (Even though R. Chiya was a Talmid of Rebbi, who was nearby, he did not refrain from separating someone from (what appeared to be) a transgression.)</p>
<p class="bas indent1"><span class="nm">(m)</span><span class="cl">Version #2 (Rashi, from Yerushalmi):</span> When Rebbi saw the people kneading in Tum'ah, he also saw a Yehudi in the part of Ako in Chutz la'Aretz. (Chachamim decreed that one who enters Chutz la'Aretz is Tamei Mes.)</p>
<p class="bas indent2"><span class="nm">1.</span><span class="cl">Rebbi:</span> Isn't your father a Kohen? (end of Version #2)</p>
<p class="bas indent2"><span class="nm">2.</span><span class="cl">The man:</span> Yes. I am his son from a divorcee (so I have no Kedushas Kehunah).</p>
<p class="bas indent1"><span class="nm">(n)</span>Surely, partial permission may be given. Rav received permission, but not to permit firstborns.</p>
<p class="bas indent1"><span class="nm">(o)</span><span class="cl">Question:</span> May permission be given for a limited time?</p>
<p class="bas indent1"><span class="nm">(p)</span><span class="cl">Answer:</span> (Yes;) R. Yochanan told R. Shemen 'You have permission until you return (to Eretz Yisrael).'</p>
<p class="bas subject"><span class="nm">3)</span>TWO WHO JUDGED A MONETARY CASE</p>
<p class="bas indent1"><span class="nm">(a)</span><span class="cl">(Shmuel):</span> If two judged a monetary case, the verdict stands, just it is called an impudent Beis Din.</p>
<p class="bas indent1"><span class="nm">(b)</span><span class="cl">Question (Rava - Mishnah):</span> Even if two judges say that he is guilty (or innocent), and the third says 'I do not know', we must add more judges. (It is as if the one who does not know is not there).</p>
<p class="bas indent2"><span class="nm">1.</span>According to Shmuel, even without the third, the judgment of the other two is valid!</p>
<p class="bas indent1"><span class="nm">(c)</span><span class="cl">Answer:</span> There, because they intended to judge in a Beis Din of three, they must give a verdict with three judges.</p>
<p class="bas indent1"><span class="nm">(d)</span><span class="cl">Question (Beraisa - R. Shimon ben Gamliel):</span> Judgment requires three judges. Compromise requires two judges;</p>
<p class="bas indent2"><span class="nm">1.</span>Compromise is stronger than judgment in one aspect. If two judges judged, the parties can retract. If they made a compromise, the parties cannot retract.</p>
<p class="bas indent2"><span class="nm">2.</span><span class="cl">Suggestion:</span> Perhaps Chachamim argue with R. Shimon ben Gamliel.</p>
<p class="bas indent2"><span class="nm">3.</span><span class="cl">Rejection:</span> R. Avahu taught that all agree that if two judged a monetary case, this is not a judgment!</p>
<p class="bas indent1"><span class="nm">(e)</span><span class="cl">Answer:</span> R. Avahu is also only an Amora. Shmuel argues with him.</p>
