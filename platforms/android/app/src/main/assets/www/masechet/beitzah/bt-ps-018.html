<div class="subject"><span class="nm">1)</span><p>THE PROHIBITION OF IMMERSING A KLI ON SHABBOS</p></div>
<div class="indent1"><span class="nm">(a)</span><p><span class="cl">Question:</span> Why is it clearly not permitted to immerse a Kli on Shabbos?</p></div>
<div class="indent1"><span class="nm">(b)</span><p><span class="cl">Answer (Rabah):</span> It is a Gezeirah lest one carry the Kli to or from the Mikveh.</p></div>
<div class="indent2"><span class="nm">1.</span><p><span class="cl">Question (Abaye):</span> What would then be the Halachah is one had a Mikveh on his property?</p></div>
<div class="indent2"><span class="nm">2.</span><p><span class="cl">Answer:</span> We would prohibit that lest we come to permit the Mikveh outside his property.</p></div>
<div class="indent2"><span class="nm">3.</span><p><span class="cl">Question:</span> What about on Yom Tov (without the Isur Hotza'ah)?</p></div>
<div class="indent2"><span class="nm">4.</span><p><span class="cl">Answer:</span> We prohibit on Yom Tov lest he permit it on Shabbos.</p></div>
<div class="indent2"><span class="nm">5.</span><p><span class="cl">Question:</span> But the Mishnah does not apply that reasoning (which would cause us to prohibit Hashakah lest we come to permit Tevilah)!?</p></div>
<div class="indent2"><span class="nm">6.</span><p><span class="cl">Answer:</span> The situation is obviously one in which he has no other water, and the care which he will naturally exercise precludes the need for a Gezeirah there.</p></div>
<div class="indent2"><span class="nm">7.</span><p><span class="cl">Question:</span> Then how could the Beraisa permit drawing water with a Kli Tamei (lest he come to immerse the Kli itself without drawing with it)!?</p></div>
<div class="indent2"><span class="nm">8.</span><p><span class="cl">Answer:</span> The fact that he is only permitted to lower the Kli in order to draw with it serves as a reminder that he may not immerse it directly (or carry it).</p></div>
<div class="indent2"><span class="nm">9.</span><p><span class="cl">Question:</span> How could the Beraisa permit the immersion of a Kli which became Tamei on Yom Tov, lest he come to immerse a Kli which became Tamei before Yom Tov!?</p></div>
<div class="indent2"><span class="nm">10.</span><p><span class="cl">Answer:</span> Tum'ah on Yom Tov is unlikely (given the Taharah preparations before Yom Tov) and thus not subject to a Gezeirah.</p></div>
<div class="indent2"><span class="nm">11.</span><p><span class="cl">Question:</span> Again, we should apply the Gezeirah reasoning to prohibit immersing a Kli which was exposed to a Vlad ha'Tum'ah (which is Tum'ah d'Rabanan in Kelim) lest we immerse one exposed to an Av ha'Tum'ah!?</p></div>
<div class="indent2"><span class="nm">12.</span><p><span class="cl">Answer:</span> Such a Kli is only relevant to Kohanim, who are Zerizim.</p></div>
<div class="indent2"><span class="nm">13.</span><p><span class="cl">Question:</span> We should prohibit a woman from immersing with her clothing lest she immerse the clothing separately!?</p></div>
<div class="indent2"><span class="nm">14.</span><p><span class="cl">Answer:</span> The fact that she is only permitted to immerse with her clothing will serve as a reminder (not to carry the items to the Mikveh).</p></div>
<div class="indent1"><span class="nm">(c)</span><p><span class="cl">Answer (R. Yosef):</span> It is a Gezeirah lest one come to Sechitah.</p></div>
<div class="indent2"><span class="nm">1.</span><p><span class="cl">Question (Abaye):</span> What about non-squeezable Kelim?</p></div>
<div class="indent2"><span class="nm">2.</span><p><span class="cl">Answer (R. Yosef):</span> Gezeirah.</p></div>
<div class="indent2"><span class="nm">3.</span><p><span class="cl">Question:</span> All the above questions.</p></div>
<div class="indent2"><span class="nm">4.</span><p><span class="cl">Answer:</span> All the above answers.</p></div>
<div class="indent1"><span class="nm">(d)</span><p><span class="cl">Answer (R. Bibi):</span> It is a Gezeirah lest one leave his Kelim for Tevilah on Yom Tov (supported by a Beraisa).</p></div>
<div class="indent1"><span class="nm">(e)</span><p><span class="cl">Answer (Rava):</span> Tevilah is prohibited since it appears like Mesaken Kli.</p></div>
<div class="indent2"><span class="nm">1.</span><p><span class="cl">Question:</span> Then the same should apply to a person!?</p></div>
<div class="indent2"><span class="nm">2.</span><p><span class="cl">Answer:</span> A person gives the appearance of going into the water to cool off.</p></div>
<div class="indent2"><span class="nm">3.</span><p><span class="cl">Question:</span> But what if the water is turbid?</p></div>
<div class="bbbline">18b----------------------------------------18b</p></div>
<div class="indent2"><span class="nm">4.</span><p><span class="cl">Answer (R. Nachman b. Yitzchak):</span> A tired person might use even this water.</p></div>
<div class="indent2"><span class="nm">5.</span><p><span class="cl">Question:</span> What about when he is not so hot, as in the rainy season?</p></div>
<div class="indent2"><span class="nm">6.</span><p><span class="cl">Answer (R. Nachman b. Yitzchak):</span> A person who is soiled might rinse off even during the rainy season.</p></div>
<div class="indent2"><span class="nm">7.</span><p><span class="cl">Question:</span> How could it be permitted on Yom Kipur?</p></div>
<div class="indent2"><span class="nm">8.</span><p><span class="cl">Answer (Rava):</span> Whatever (Ho'il) is permitted on Shabbos is permitted on Yom Kipur.</p></div>
<div class="indent3"><span class="nm">i.</span><p><span class="cl">Question:</span> But we find that Rava does not subscribe to Ho'il (since he gave a different answer to resolve the contradictory Beraisos dealing with eating and Refuah)?</p></div>
<div class="indent3"><span class="nm">ii.</span><p><span class="cl">Answer:</span> Rava reversed his position in that discussion, and applied Ho'il.</p></div>
<div class="indent3"><span class="nm">iii.</span><p><span class="cl">Question:</span> How do we know that he reversed his position there in favor of Ho'il; perhaps he reversed his position here against Ho'il?!</p></div>
<div class="indent3"><span class="nm">iv.</span><p><span class="cl">Answer:</span> That seems unlikely given the Beraisa which permits Tevilah on Yom Kipur (which must be on account of Ho'il).</p></div>
<div class="subject"><span class="nm">2)</span><p>HASHAKAH VS. TEVILAH</p></div>
<div class="indent1"><span class="nm">(a)</span><p><span class="cl">Question:</span> What is meant by not doing Tevilah?</p></div>
<div class="indent1"><span class="nm">(b)</span><p><span class="cl">Answer (Shmuel):</span> It prohibits doing Hashakah with the water within a Kli in order to be Metaher the Kli as well.</p></div>
<div class="indent1"><span class="nm">(c)</span><p><span class="cl">Question:</span> Who is the author of our Mishnah?</p></div>
<div class="indent2"><span class="nm">1.</span><p><span class="cl">(Rebbi):</span> One may not do Tevilah or Hashakah.</p></div>
<div class="indent2"><span class="nm">2.</span><p><span class="cl">(Rabanan):</span> One may do either.</p></div>
<div class="indent2"><span class="nm">3.</span><p>According to Rebbi, Hashakah is not permitted, yet our Mishnah permits it.</p></div>
<div class="indent2"><span class="nm">4.</span><p>According to Rabanan, Tevilah is permitted and our Mishnah forbids it!?</p></div>
<div class="indent1"><span class="nm">(d)</span><p><span class="cl">Answer:</span> Our Mishnah could be either Rebbi or Rabanan.</p></div>
<div class="indent2"><span class="nm">1.</span><p>If Rebbi, we will assume that he forbids Tevilah on Yom Tov (when only Hashakah is permitted) and prohibits Hashakah (the second part of his statement in the Beraisa) on Shabbos (while our Mishnah is speaking entirely about Yom Tov).</p></div>
<div class="indent2"><span class="nm">2.</span><p>If Rabanan, they permit both on Yom Tov and our Mishnah would be speaking entirely about Shabbos.</p></div>
