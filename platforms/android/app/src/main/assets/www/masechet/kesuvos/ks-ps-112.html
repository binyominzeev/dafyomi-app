<div class="subject"><span class="nm">1)</span><p>THE PRODUCE OF <i>ERETZ</i> <i>YISRAEL</i> (cont.)</p></div>
<div class="indent1"><span class="nm">(a)</span><p>R. Avira and R. Yosi bar Chanina came to a certain place. They were served peaches measuring eight Sa'im. They ate a third, declared a third ownerless, and gave a third to their animals.</p></div>
<div class="indent1"><span class="nm">(b)</span><p>The next year R. Elazar went there. Upon seeing the fruit, he cited "The fruitful land has become a salty (unfertile) land, from the evil of its inhabitants."</p></div>
<div class="indent1"><span class="nm">(c)</span><p>R. Yehoshua ben Levi went to Gavla. He saw grape clusters the size of calves. He bewailed, 'Eretz (Yisrael), take in your fruit! For whom are you producing? For those who stand against us because of our sins?!'</p></div>
<div class="indent1"><span class="nm">(d)</span><p>R. Chiya went there the next year; the clusters were like goats. The inhabitants asked him to leave, lest he make a similar request.</p></div>
<div class="indent1"><span class="nm">(e)</span><p><span class="cl">(Beraisa):</span> When Eretz Yisrael was blessed, the area in which one sows one Se'ah of seed produced 50,000 Korin (a Kor is about 300 liters). When Tzo'an was settled such an area produced 70 Kor.</p></div>
<div class="indent1"><span class="nm">(f)</span><p><span class="cl">(Beraisa - R. Meir):</span> I saw that in Beis She'an such an area produced 70 Korin.</p></div>
<div class="indent1"><span class="nm">(g)</span><p>The best land in Chutz la'Aretz is Mitzrayim - "Like the garden of Hash-m, like Mitzrayim." The best area in Mitzrayim is Tzo'an. "Ki Hayu b'Tzo'an Sarav", there they raised kings;</p></div>
<div class="indent2"><span class="nm">1.</span><p>The worst part of Eretz Yisrael is Chevron; it was used for a burial site. Still, it was seven times better than Tzo'an - "Chevron was built seven years before Tzo'an".</p></div>
<div class="indent2"><span class="nm">2.</span><p><span class="cl">Question:</span> What does this mean?</p></div>
<div class="indent3"><span class="nm">i.</span><p><span class="cl">Suggestion:</span> It was built seven years earlier.</p></div>
<div class="indent3"><span class="nm">ii.</span><p><span class="cl">Rejection:</span> A person (Cham) would not build a residence for his younger son (Kena'an) before building for his older son (Mitzrayim)!</p></div>
<div class="indent2"><span class="nm">3.</span><p><span class="cl">Answer:</span> Rather, it was seven times better.</p></div>
<div class="indent1"><span class="nm">(h)</span><p>This applies to the muddy parts of Eretz Yisrael. The other parts produced 500 Korin.</p></div>
<div class="indent1"><span class="nm">(i)</span><p>In times of Berachah, it produces 100 times more.</p></div>
<div class="indent1"><span class="nm">(j)</span><p><span class="cl">(Beraisa - R. Yosi):</span> One Se'ah of grain in Yehudah used to produce five Sa'im: one Se'ah of flour, one Se'ah of fine flour, one Se'ah of bran, one Se'ah Morsan (bran that leaves the sifter later), and one Se'ah of inferior flour.</p></div>
<div class="indent1"><span class="nm">(k)</span><p><span class="cl">A Kara'ite praised Eretz Yisrael:</span> I inherited an area for seeding one Se'ah. I get from it oil, wine, grain, legumes and pasture for my cattle.</p></div>
<div class="indent1"><span class="nm">(l)</span><p>An Emori (of the seven nations originally in Eretz Yisrael) was boasting to a Yisrael that he used to harvest 120 Korin from a date tree on the bank of the Jordan.</p></div>
<div class="indent2"><span class="nm">1.</span><p>He mistakenly thought that the Yisrael harvested less.</p></div>
<div class="indent1"><span class="nm">(m)</span><p><span class="cl">(Rav Chisda):</span> Eretz Yisrael is compared to a deer. Just like the skin of a deer cannot hold the flesh (after flaying), also Eretz Yisrael cannot hold its abundance of produce.</p></div>
<div class="indent1"><span class="nm">(n)</span><p>Also, just like a deer is the quickest animal, Eretz Yisrael is the quickest land to ripen its produce.</p></div>
<div class="indent1"><span class="nm">(o)</span><p><span class="cl">Suggestion:</span> Perhaps just like a deer is swift but not fatty, also Eretz Yisrael is quick to ripen produce, but they are not fat!</p></div>
<div class="indent1"><span class="nm">(p)</span><p><span class="cl">Rejection:</span> "Flowing with milk and honey" - they are fatter than milk and sweeter than honey.</p></div>
<div class="subject"><span class="nm">2)</span><p>THE DEARNESS OF ERETZ YISRAEL</p></div>
<div class="indent1"><span class="nm">(a)</span><p>When R. Elazar came to Eretz Yisrael, he said 'I was saved from one curse.' When he was ordained, he said 'I was saved from a second.' When he was taught the secret of declaring leap months, he said 'I was saved from a third.' (We now explain the curses.)</p></div>
<div class="indent1"><span class="nm">(b)</span><p>"In the secret of My nation they will not sit" is the secret of declaring leap months. "They will not be written among Beis Yisrael" is ordination. "To the land of Yisrael they will not come" is understood simply.</p></div>
<div class="indent1"><span class="nm">(c)</span><p>When R. Zeira was coming to Eretz Yisrael, he did not find a ferry. He crossed on a narrow beam with a rope above for support.</p></div>
<div class="indent2"><span class="nm">1.</span><p><span class="cl">A Kara'ite:</span> You are a hasty nation. You put your mouths before your ears (Na'aseh v'Nishma), and you are still in your haste!</p></div>
<div class="indent2"><span class="nm">2.</span><p><span class="cl">R. Zeira:</span> Moshe and Aharon did not merit to enter this land. Who says that I will merit to enter it?! (Surely, I must seize the chance!)</p></div>
<div class="indent1"><span class="nm">(d)</span><p>R. Aba used to kiss the rocks of Ako. R. Chanina would level places where one might stumble (lest people disparage the roads). R. Ami and R. Asi would go to a shady or sunny area, according to the weather (to prevent complaints).</p></div>
<div class="bbbline">112b----------------------------------------112b</p></div>
<div class="indent1"><span class="nm">(e)</span><p>R. Chiya bar Gamda would roll in the dirt - "Your servants love its stones and its dirt."</p></div>
<div class="indent1"><span class="nm">(f)</span><p><span class="cl">(R. Zeira):</span> In the generation in which Mashi'ach ben David will come, there will be accusations against the Chachamim.</p></div>
<div class="indent2"><span class="nm">1.</span><p><span class="cl">(Shmuel):</span> There will be decrees upon decrees.</p></div>
<div class="indent2"><span class="nm">2.</span><p><span class="cl">(Rav Yosef):</span> There will be looters upon looters.</p></div>
<div class="indent1"><span class="nm">(g)</span><p><span class="cl">(R. Chiya bar Ashi):</span> In the future, all barren trees in Eretz Yisrael will bear fruit - "The tree will bear its fruit, the date tree and vine will give their strength".</p></div>
