<div class="indent1"><span class="nm">(a)</span><p><span class="cl">Resolution #2 (Rav Sheshes):</span> Beraisa #2 teaches that one does not transgress (for delaying) Pidyon Peter Chamor until 30 days.</p></div>
<div class="indent1"><span class="nm">(b)</span><p><span class="cl">Question (Rami bar Chama - Beraisa):</span> The Mitzvah (of Pidyon Peter Chamor) is all 30 days. After this, he redeems it or does Arifah.</p></div>
<div class="indent2"><span class="nm">1.</span><p><span class="cl">Suggestion:</span> This means that the Mitzvah is to wait 30 days before redeeming!</p></div>
<div class="indent1"><span class="nm">(c)</span><p><span class="cl">Answer:</span> No, it means that for the first 30 days the Mitzvah is to redeem.</p></div>
<div class="indent1"><span class="nm">(d)</span><p><span class="cl">Objection:</span> If so, it should not say "after this, he redeems it or does Arifah," rather, "after this, he redeems it or transgresses"!</p></div>
<div class="indent1"><span class="nm">(e)</span><p><span class="cl">Resolution #3 (Rava):</span> Beraisa #1 is like R. Eliezer, who equates Pidyon Peter Chamor to Pidyon ha'Ben. Beraisa #2 is like Chachamim, who do not equate them.</p></div>

<div class="indent1"><span class="nm">(a)</span><p><span class="cl">(Mishnah):</span> If the owner of a Peter Chamor (or a Kohen who received one) does not want to redeem it, he does Arifah from the back of the neck and buries it;</p></div>
<div class="indent2"><span class="nm">1.</span><p>The Mitzvah to redeem it takes precedence over Mitzvas Arifah - "v'Im Lo Sifdeh va'Arafto";</p></div>
<div class="indent1"><span class="nm">(b)</span><p>The Mitzvah (for an Amah Ivriyah's master) to do Yi'ud (marry her) takes precedence over the Mitzvah (for her or her father) to redeem her(self) - "Asher Lo Ye'Adah v'Hefdah."</p></div>
<div class="indent1"><span class="nm">(c)</span><p>At first, people would do Yibum l'Shem Mitzvah, so it had precedence over Chalitzah;</p></div>
<div class="indent2"><span class="nm">1.</span><p>Nowadays, people are not l'Shem Mitzvah (such a Yibum is like Arayos, i.e. Eshes Ach), so Chalitzah takes precedence.</p></div>
<div class="indent1"><span class="nm">(d)</span><p>If one was Makdish (to Bedek ha'Bayis), he has precedence to redeem over anyone else (R. Gershom - because he adds a Chomesh - "v'Yasaf Chamishiso Alav), v'Im Lo Yiga'el v'Nimchar b'Erkecha."</p></div>

<div class="indent1"><span class="nm">(a)</span><p><span class="cl">(Mishnah):</span> In the following cases, a cow's first calf does not get Kedushas Bechor:</p></div>
<div class="indent2"><span class="nm">1.</span><p>If one bought the fetus in a Nochri's cow;</p></div>

<div class="indent1"><span class="nm">(d)</span><p><span class="cl">(Gemara) Question:</span> Why does our Masechta begin with Peter Chamor, and only afterwards it discusses Bechor Behemah Tehorah?</p></div>
<div class="indent2"><span class="nm">1.</span><p>It would be is more reasonable to begin with Kedushas ha'Guf, and then to teach about Kedushas Damim!</p></div>
<div class="indent1"><span class="nm">(e)</span><p><span class="cl">Answer #1 (Chachamim of Eretz Yisrael):</span> The Tana prefers to teach about donkeys first, due to R. Chanina's teaching.

<div class="indent1"><span class="nm">(f)</span><p><span class="cl">Answer #2:</span> Because there are fewer laws of Peter Chamor, the Tana immediately taught them in the first Perek, and teaches about Bechor Behemah Tehorah in (most of) the rest of the Masechta.</p></div>

<div class="indent1"><span class="nm">(a)</span><p><span class="cl">(Reish Lakish citing R.

<div class="indent2"><span class="nm">1.</span><p>If a Nochri gave money to a Yisrael for his Behemah, we follow their law (this will be explained). Even though he did not do Meshichah, he acquired it, and it is exempt from Bechorah.</p></div>
<div class="indent1"><span class="nm">(b)</span><p><span class="cl">Question:</span> What is the meaning of (in the Reisha) "We follow their law"?</p></div>
<div class="indent2"><span class="nm">1.</span><p><span class="cl">Suggestion:</span> We learn from the law of buying a Nochri (slave);</p></div>
<div class="indent3"><span class="nm">i.</span><p>A Yisrael acquires a Nochri through money. Slaves are called "Lareshes Achuzah" (an inheritance). They are equated to land;</p></div>
<div class="indent3"><span class="nm">ii.</span><p>Just like land is acquired through money, a document or Chazakah (usage), also an Eved Kena'ani.</p></div>
<div class="indent2"><span class="nm">2.</span><p>Money acquires a Nochri. All the more so it acquires his property!</p></div>
<div class="indent2"><span class="nm">3.</span><p><span class="cl">Rejection #1:</span> The same reasoning would show that documents and Chazakah acquire his property (but this is not true)!</p></div>
<div class="indent2"><span class="nm">4.</span><p><span class="cl">Rejection #2:</span> A similar Kal va'Chomer should apply to Yisraelim, but the resulting law is not true! (This shows that we may not make such a Kal va'Chomer.)</p></div>

<div class="indent2"><span class="nm">1.</span><p>A Yisrael acquires through Meshichah "mi'Yad Amisecha" -- from (the hand of) another Yisrael. He does not acquire from a Nochri through Meshichah, rather, through money.</p></div>
<div class="indent2"><span class="nm">2.</span><p><span class="cl">Suggestion:</span> Perhaps he does not acquire from a Nochri at all (R. Gershom; Rashi - until he actually takes it to his premises. When acquiring from a Yisrael, it suffices to take it to his Reshus (or to a place where he may stop), e.g. totally in his hand, three Tefachim off the ground (Hagbahah), or to a shoulder of Reshus ha'Rabim.)</p></div>
<div class="indent2"><span class="nm">3.</span><p><span class="cl">Rejection:</span> Money acquires (Tosfos - an Eved Ivri for) a Nochri. All the more so money acquires his property!

<div class="indent1"><span class="nm">(h)</span><p><span class="cl">Question:</span> We understand this if he holds like R.

<div class="indent2"><span class="nm">1.</span><p>If he holds like Reish Lakish, who says that mid'Oraisa a Yisrael acquires through Meshichah, just like a Nochri, how does he expound "Amisecha"?</p></div>
<div class="indent1"><span class="nm">(i)</span><p><span class="cl">Answer:</span> (The verse discusses Ona'ah (overcharging) -- "v'Chi Simkero Mimkar la'Amisecha Oh Kano mi'Yad Amisecha Al Tonu.") "Amisecha" teaches that Ona'ah must be returned to a Yisrael, but not to a Nochri. (Rashash - however, one may not overcharge him.)</p></div>
<div class="indent1"><span class="nm">(j)</span><p><span class="cl">Question:</span> We learn this from the end of the verse, "Al Tonu <i>Ish Es Achiv</i>"!</p></div>
<div class="indent1"><span class="nm">(k)</span><p><span class="cl">Answer:</span> One of these excludes Ona'ah of a Nochri, and one excludes Ona'ah of Hekdesh. The Torah needed to teach both:</p></div>
<div class="indent2"><span class="nm">1.</span><p>Had it taught only about Ona'ah of a Nochri, we would have thought that Ona'ah applies to Hekdesh. Therefore, both are needed.</p></div>
<div class="indent1"><span class="nm">(l)</span><p><span class="cl">Question:</span> This is like the opinion that forbids stealing from Nochrim;</p></div>
<div class="indent2"><span class="nm">1.</span><p>According to the opinion that permits, there is no need to teach that Ona'ah does not apply to Nochrim!</p></div>
<div class="indent1"><span class="nm">(m)</span><p><span class="cl">Answer:</span> Indeed, if Ameimar permits Gezel Nochri, he must hold like R. Yochanan.</p></div>

<div class="indent1"><span class="nm">(a)</span><p><span class="cl">Question (Beraisa):</span> If a Yisrael bought pieces of silver from a Nochri, and found idolatry among them:</p></div>
<div class="indent2"><span class="nm">1.</span><p>If he did Meshichah but did not yet give the money, he can return it;</p></div>
<div class="indent2"><span class="nm">2.</span><p>If he did Meshichah after giving the money, he must cast the idolatry to the Dead Sea. (He acquired it, and one may not benefit from idolatry.)</p></div>
<div class="indent3"><span class="nm">i.</span><p>If money acquires from Nochrim, why does the Seifa mention Meshichah? He acquired through money alone!</p></div>
<div class="indent1"><span class="nm">(b)</span><p><span class="cl">Answer #1:</span> The case is, the Nochri agreed to conduct according to the law of Yisrael. (Only Meshichah acquires.)</p></div>
<div class="indent1"><span class="nm">(c)</span><p><span class="cl">Question:</span> If so, why does the Beraisa discuss giving money?</p></div>
<div class="indent1"><span class="nm">(d)</span><p><span class="cl">Answer:</span> It teaches that even though he gave money, if he did not do Meshichah, he may return it.</p></div>
<div class="indent1"><span class="nm">(e)</span><p><span class="cl">Question:</span> Also in the Reisha, he did Meshichah. Why may he return it?</p></div>
<div class="indent1"><span class="nm">(f)</span><p><span class="cl">Answer #1 (Abaye):</span> It is a Mekach Ta'us (mistaken sale. He never intended to buy idolatry, so he never acquired it).</p></div>

<div class="indent1"><span class="nm">(h)</span><p><span class="cl">Answer #1 (and Answer #2 to Question (e) - Rava):</span> In both clauses it is a Mekach Ta'us;</p></div>
<div class="indent2"><span class="nm">1.</span><p>In the Reisha, he did not give money, so it does not look like a Yisrael's idolatry;</p></div>

<div class="indent1"><span class="nm">(i)</span><p><span class="cl">Answer #2 (Abaye):</span> In the Reisha it is a Mekach Ta'us. Since he did not give money, it is understandable that he did not know that there is idolatry among them;</p></div>
<div class="indent2"><span class="nm">1.</span><p>In the Seifa he gave money. He should have examined them before doing Meshichah. Since he did not do so, he accepted whatever is there!</p></div>
<div class="indent1"><span class="nm">(j)</span><p><span class="cl">Answer #2 (to question (a) - Rav Ashi):</span> The Reisha shows that Meshichah does not acquire, therefore also in the Seifa it does not acquire;</p></div>
<div class="indent2"><span class="nm">1.</span><p>Really, the Seifa need not mention Meshichah. It is only for parallel structure with the Reisha.</p></div>
<div class="indent1"><span class="nm">(k)</span><p><span class="cl">Answer #3 (Ravina):</span> The Seifa shows that Meshichah acquires, therefore also in the Reisha it acquires;</p></div>
<div class="indent2"><span class="nm">1.</span><p>The Reisha means, if he did not give money <i>nor</i> do Meshichah, he can return it.</p></div>
<div class="indent1"><span class="nm">(l)</span><p><span class="cl">Question:</span> If he did neither Kinyan, there is nothing to return!</p></div>
<div class="indent1"><span class="nm">(m)</span><p><span class="cl">Answer:</span> He may retract his words;</p></div>
<div class="indent2"><span class="nm">1.</span><p>The Tana holds that one who retracts from verbal commitments <i>to a Yisrael</i> is unfaithful, for a Yisrael honors his word;</p></div>
