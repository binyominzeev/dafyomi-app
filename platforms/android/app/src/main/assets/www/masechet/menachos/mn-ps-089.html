<div class="subject"><span class="nm">1)</span><p>OIL FOR LACHMEI TODAH AND LACHMEI NAZIR</p></div>
<div class="indent1"><span class="nm">(a)</span><p><span class="cl">(Mishnah):</span> A half-Log of oil is used for Todah.</p></div>
<div class="indent1"><span class="nm">(b)</span><p><span class="cl">(Beraisa - R. Akiva) Question:</span> (It says "Chalos Matzos Belulos ba'Shemen u'Rekikei Matzos Meshuchim ba'Shamen.") Why must it say 'Shemen' twice?</p></div>
<div class="indent2"><span class="nm">1.</span><p><span class="cl">Answer:</span> Had it said 'Shemen' only once, we would have thought that these are like all other Menachos, which have one Log of oil;</p></div>
<div class="indent3"><span class="nm">i.</span><p>Therefore, it says 'Shemen' twice. Two Ribuyim (inclusions) to include the same thing really come to exclude. We deduct half a Log, and only a half-Log is used.</p></div>
<div class="indent2"><span class="nm">2.</span><p><span class="cl">Question:</span> There are not two Ribuyim! (One is needed to teach that oil is used.)</p></div>
<div class="indent2"><span class="nm">3.</span><p><span class="cl">Answer:</span> Had it not said 'Shemen' at all, we would have said that one Log is used, like other Menachos. Therefore, the two words 'Shemen' are two Ribuyim.</p></div>
<div class="indent2"><span class="nm">4.</span><p><span class="cl">Suggestion:</span> Perhaps the half-Log is divided evenly among the three kinds of Matzah! (The verse ends "v'Soles Murbeches Belulos ba'Shamen.")</p></div>
<div class="indent2"><span class="nm">5.</span><p><span class="cl">Rejection:</span> There was no need to mention oil regarding Revuchah. (We would have learned from Chavitim, which are also called Revuchah and have oil);</p></div>
<div class="indent3"><span class="nm">i.</span><p>It is mentioned to teach that it has more oil, i.e. half of the half-Log is for the Revuchah, and the other half (of the half-Log) is for the Chalos and Rekikim.</p></div>
<div class="indent2"><span class="nm">6.</span><p><span class="cl">R. Elazar ben Azaryah:</span> I do not accept your Drashos. Rather, a tradition from Sinai teaches a half-Log for Lachmei Todah (R. Gershom - that it is split equally among the three kinds of Matzah), a quarter-Log for Lachmei Nazir, and 11 days (in which blood that a woman sees can make her a Zavah) that separate between Nidos (i.e. days on which any blood seen is Dam Nidah).</p></div>
<div class="subject"><span class="nm">2)</span><p>OIL FOR MENACHOS</p></div>
<div class="indent1"><span class="nm">(a)</span><p><span class="cl">(Mishnah):</span> The Log was used for Menachos.</p></div>
<div class="indent1"><span class="nm">(b)</span><p><span class="cl">(Beraisa - Chachamim):</span> Regarding a poor Metzora it says "v'Isaron... Balul... v'Log" to teach that each Isaron (of Soles) requires a Log (of oil);</p></div>
<div class="indent1"><span class="nm">(c)</span><p>R. Nechemyah and R. Eliezer say, only one Log is used, even for a Minchah of 60 Esronim - "l'Minchah v'Log Shamen."</p></div>
<div class="indent1"><span class="nm">(d)</span><p><span class="cl">Question:</span> How do R. Nechemyah and R. Eliezer expound "v'Isaron... Balul... v'Log"?</p></div>
<div class="indent1"><span class="nm">(e)</span><p><span class="cl">Answer:</span> This teaches that the Oni must bring an Isaron (with a Log of oil).</p></div>
<div class="indent2"><span class="nm">1.</span><p>Chachamim say, we already know that. Since a rich person brings three Zevachim and three Esronim, surely an Oni, who bring one Zevach, brings one Isaron!</p></div>
<div class="indent2"><span class="nm">2.</span><p>They answer that since the Torah is lenient for an Oni, one might have thought that he does not bring a Minchah at all!</p></div>
<div class="indent2"><span class="nm">3.</span><p>Chachamim say, we never find a Zevach (except for Bechor, Ma'aser and Pesach, which never have Nesachim) brought without Nesachim.</p></div>
<div class="indent1"><span class="nm">(f)</span><p><span class="cl">Question:</span> How do Chachamim expound  "l'Minchah v'Log Shamen"?</p></div>
<div class="indent1"><span class="nm">(g)</span><p><span class="cl">Answer:</span> This teaches that one who volunteers to bring a Minchah must bring at least the amount of Soles that requires a Log of oil, i.e. an Isaron.</p></div>
<div class="indent1"><span class="nm">(h)</span><p>R. Nechemyah and R. Eliezer learn also this from the verse (in addition to learning that one Log is used even for a big Minchah).</p></div>
<div class="indent1"><span class="nm">(i)</span><p><span class="cl">(Mishnah):</span> Six Lugim are for a bull, four are for a ram, and three are for a lamb.</p></div>
<div class="indent1"><span class="nm">(j)</span><p><span class="cl">Question:</span> What is the source for this?</p></div>
<div class="indent1"><span class="nm">(k)</span><p><span class="cl">Answer:</span> It says "v'Niskeihem Chetzi ha'Hin Yihyeh la'Par...";</p></div>
<div class="indent2"><span class="nm">1.</span><p>We know that a Hin is 12 Lugim from "Shemen Mishchas Kodesh Yihyeh Zeh Li." The Gematri'a of "Zeh" is 12.</p></div>
<div class="subject"><span class="nm">3)</span><p>OIL FOR THE MENORAH</p></div>
<div class="indent1"><span class="nm">(a)</span><p><span class="cl">(Mishnah):</span> Three and a half Lugim were used for the Menorah. Half a Log was for each lamp.</p></div>
<div class="indent1"><span class="nm">(b)</span><p><span class="cl">Question:</span> What is the source of this?</p></div>
<div class="indent1"><span class="nm">(c)</span><p><span class="cl">Answer (Beraisa):</span> "Me'Erev Ad Boker" teaches that we put in enough oil to burn from evening until morning;</p></div>
<div class="indent2"><span class="nm">1.</span><p>This also teaches that Hadlakas ha'Menorah is the only Avodah that applies all night.</p></div>
<div class="indent2"><span class="nm">2.</span><p>Chachamim estimated that a half-Log suffices (for the longest nights, i.e. in winter).</p></div>
<div class="indent1"><span class="nm">(d)</span><p><span class="cl">Opinion #1:</span> They estimated from above (first they used more than a half-Log. When they saw that it was too much, they successively used less until they found the right Shi'ur);</p></div>
<div class="indent1"><span class="nm">(e)</span><p><span class="cl">Opinion #2:</span> They estimated from below (first they used less. They successively used more until they found the right Shi'ur).</p></div>
<div class="indent1"><span class="nm">(f)</span><p>Opinion #2 says that they started putting too little. The Torah is concerned for money of Yisrael (extra oil put inside cannot be salvaged);</p></div>
<div class="indent1"><span class="nm">(g)</span><p>Opinion #1 says that they started putting too much. We do not conduct like paupers in the place of wealth (the Mikdash).</p></div>
<div class="subject"><span class="nm">4)</span><p>MIXING NESACHIM</p></div>
<div class="indent1"><span class="nm">(a)</span><p><span class="cl">(Mishnah):</span> The following Nesachim may be mixed with each other:</p></div>
<div class="indent2"><span class="nm">1.</span><p>Nesachim of bulls with Nesachim of rams (these have the same consistency, two Lugim of oil per Isaron of Soles);</p></div>
<div class="indent2"><span class="nm">2.</span><p>Nesachim of lambs with each other, Nesachim of Korbanos Yachid with those of Korbanos Tzibur, and Nesachim of today with those of yesterday.</p></div>
<div class="bbbline">89b----------------------------------------89b</p></div>
<div class="indent1"><span class="nm">(b)</span><p>We may not mix Nesachim of lambs (which have three Lugim of oil for one Isaron) with those of bulls or rams;</p></div>
<div class="indent2"><span class="nm">1.</span><p>If each Nesech was Balul (mixed with oil) by itself, and then the Nesachim became mixed, they are Kesherim;</p></div>
<div class="indent2"><span class="nm">2.</span><p>If the Nesachim became mixed before Belilah, they are Pesulim.</p></div>
<div class="indent1"><span class="nm">(c)</span><p>The Minchah of the lamb brought with the Omer is (two Esronim,) twice the usual Minchas Nesachim for a lamb, but its Nesech (of wine) is the usual size (three Lugim).</p></div>
<div class="indent1"><span class="nm">(d)</span><p><span class="cl">(Gemara) Contradiction (Beraisa):</span> "V'Hiktiro" teaches that we may not mix the Chelev of different animals together. (Our Mishnah permits mixing Nesachim of bulls and rams!)</p></div>
<div class="indent1"><span class="nm">(e)</span><p><span class="cl">Answer #1 (R. Yochanan):</span> The Mishnah teaches that b'Di'eved, if the Nesachim were mixed, they are Kesherim.</p></div>
<div class="indent1"><span class="nm">(f)</span><p><span class="cl">Question:</span> If so, when the Mishnah forbids mixing Nesachim of lambs with those of bulls, we must say that even b'Di'eved, they are Pesulim;</p></div>
<div class="indent2"><span class="nm">1.</span><p>The Seifa says that if each Nesech was Balul by itself and then they were mixed, they are Kesherim. This implies that in the Reisha they may be mixed l'Chatchilah!</p></div>
<div class="indent1"><span class="nm">(g)</span><p><span class="cl">Answer (Abaye):</span> R. Yochanan means that if the Menachos became mixed, the Nesachim of wine may be mixed.</p></div>
<div class="indent1"><span class="nm">(h)</span><p><span class="cl">Objection:</span> This implies that (if the Menachos were not mixed) the wines may not be mixed. A Beraisa contradicts this!</p></div>
<div class="indent2"><span class="nm">1.</span><p><span class="cl">(Beraisa):</span> This refers to Menachos (of Nesachim), but the wines may be mixed.</p></div>
<div class="indent1"><span class="nm">(i)</span><p><span class="cl">Answer #2 (Abaye):</span> After Haktaras ha'Menachos, l'Chatchilah we may mix the wines (Rashi Kesav Yad - no matter which animals they are for; Rambam - only if the accompanying Menachos have the same consistency);</p></div>
<div class="indent2"><span class="nm">1.</span><p>Before Haktarah, if Menachos (of the same consistency) became mixed, the corresponding wines may be mixed;</p></div>
<div class="indent2"><span class="nm">2.</span><p>If the Menachos were not mixed, the wines may not be mixed. This is a decree, lest one mix the Menachos.</p></div>
<div class="subject"><span class="nm">5)</span><p>THE LAMB BROUGHT WITH THE OMER</p></div>
<div class="indent1"><span class="nm">(a)</span><p><span class="cl">(Mishnah):</span> The Minchah of the lamb brought with the Omer...</p></div>
<div class="indent1"><span class="nm">(b)</span><p><span class="cl">(Beraisa):</span> "U'Minchaso Shnei Esronim" teaches that the Minchah of the lamb brought with the Omer is twice the usual Minchas Nesachim for a lamb;</p></div>
<div class="indent2"><span class="nm">1.</span><p><span class="cl">Suggestion:</span> Perhaps also the wine is double the usual amount!</p></div>
<div class="indent2"><span class="nm">2.</span><p><span class="cl">Rejection:</span> It says "v'Nisko Yayin Revi'is ha'Hin."</p></div>
<div class="indent2"><span class="nm">3.</span><p><span class="cl">Suggestion:</span> Perhaps the wine is not double, for it is not mixed with the Minchah, but oil is mixed with the Minchah, so it is also double!</p></div>
<div class="indent2"><span class="nm">4.</span><p><span class="cl">Rejection:</span> "V'Nisko" teaches that every liquid for its Nesachim is a Revi'is.</p></div>
<div class="indent2"><span class="nm">5.</span><p><span class="cl">Question:</span> How do we learn this from the verse?</p></div>
<div class="indent2"><span class="nm">6.</span><p><span class="cl">Answer (R. Elazar):</span> It is written "v'Niskah" (feminine, i.e. (oil) of the Minchah), but we read it "v'Nisko" (masculine, i.e. (wine) of the lamb). This equates the oil to the wine, so also it is a Revi'is.</p></div>
<div class="indent1"><span class="nm">(c)</span><p><span class="cl">(R. Yochanan):</span> If Asham Metzora was slaughtered Lo Lishmah, it requires Nesachim;</p></div>
<div class="indent2"><span class="nm">1.</span><p>If you would say that it does not have Nesachim, it would be Pasul. (An Asham Metzora is not Kosher without Nesachim, and it cannot be another Korban!)</p></div>
<div class="indent1"><span class="nm">(d)</span><p><span class="cl">Questions (Rav Menasiya bar Gada):</span> If so, if the lamb brought with the Omer was slaughtered Lo Lishmah, it should likewise require a double Minchah (as if it were Lishmah). If not, it should be Pasul;</p></div>
<div class="indent2"><span class="nm">1.</span><p>If the morning Tamid was slaughtered Lo Lishmah, we should need to have one Kohen bring two logs for the Ma'arachah with it (as if it was Lishmah). If not, it should be Pasul! (Likewise, for the afternoon Tamid, two Kohanim must bring two logs.)</p></div>
<div class="indent1"><span class="nm">(e)</span><p><span class="cl">Answer #1 (Abaye):</span> Indeed, that is true. R. Yochanan did not teach about Asham Metzora to exclude those. He merely taught one example.</p></div>
