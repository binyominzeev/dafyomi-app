<div class="subject"><span class="nm">1)</span><p>CHANGING MEASURES</p></div>
<div class="indent1"><span class="nm">(a)</span><p>There are three kinds of Matzah (in Lachmei Todah), Chalos, Rekikim and Revuchah;</p></div>
<div class="indent2"><span class="nm">1.</span><p>Three and a third Esronim are used for each kind of Matzah. Three loaves are made from each Isaron.</p></div>
<div class="indent1"><span class="nm">(b)</span><p>According to the Yerushalmi measures, these are 30 Kavim. Fifteen are for the Chametz, and 15 for the Matzah;</p></div>
<div class="indent2"><span class="nm">1.</span><p>Each Chametz loaf is one and a half Kavim;</p></div>
<div class="indent2"><span class="nm">2.</span><p>Five Kavim are used for each kind of Matzah, two loaves to each Kav.</p></div>
<div class="indent1"><span class="nm">(c)</span><p><span class="cl">(Gemara) Question:</span> What is the source that an Eifah is three Sa'im?</p></div>
<div class="indent1"><span class="nm">(d)</span><p><span class="cl">Answer (Rav Chisda):</span> "Ha'Eifah veha'Bas Tochen Echad Yihyeh (they are the same)";</p></div>
<div class="indent2"><span class="nm">1.</span><p>An Eifah is three Sa'im, just like a Bas.</p></div>
<div class="indent1"><span class="nm">(e)</span><p><span class="cl">Question:</span> What is the source that a Bas is three Sa'im?</p></div>
<div class="indent2"><span class="nm">1.</span><p><span class="cl">Suggestion:</span> We learn from "Lases Ma'aser ha'Chomer ha'Bas." (Bas is a tenth of a Chomer.)</p></div>
<div class="indent2"><span class="nm">2.</span><p><span class="cl">Rejection:</span> If we know Chomer (that it is 30 Sa'im), we can learn Eifah directly from it (we need not learn from Bas) - "va'Asiris ha'Chomer ha'Eifah"! (Apparently, the Gemara did not know the meaning of "Chomer". This is difficult, for Vayikra 27:16 says that a field in which a Chomer of barley is sown is redeemed for 50 Shekalim. The Gemara (Erchin 25a) did not need a source that this is a Beis Kor.)</p></div>
<div class="indent1"><span class="nm">(f)</span><p><span class="cl">Answer:</span> We learn from "...Ma'aser ha'Bas Min ha'Kor." (It was known that a Kor is 30 Sa'im. The end of the verse teaches that also Chomer is 30 Sa'im - "Aseres ha'Batim Chomer...")</p></div>
<div class="indent1"><span class="nm">(g)</span><p><span class="cl">(Shmuel):</span> People of the city may not increase the measures more than a sixth, nor may they increase the (weight of the) coins by more than a sixth. A grocer may not charge more than a sixth above the price he pays for produce.</p></div>
<div class="indent1"><span class="nm">(h)</span><p><span class="cl">Question:</span> Why may we not increase the measures more than a sixth?</p></div>
<div class="indent2"><span class="nm">1.</span><p><span class="cl">Suggestion:</span> When merchants see that the measures increased, they will raise prices more than they should (Rashi. Rashi Kesav Yad - perhaps they will think that there is a food shortage, and raise prices.)</p></div>
<div class="indent2"><span class="nm">2.</span><p><span class="cl">Rejection:</span> If so, it should be forbidden to increase them even a sixth!</p></div>
<div class="indent1"><span class="nm">(i)</span><p><span class="cl">Answer #1:</span> We do not want to invalidate sales. (If a merchant did not know about the increase, he will charge the usual amount, people will buy using their own (new, increased) measure, and underpay more than a sixth. When the seller finds out, he can invalidate the sale.)</p></div>
<div class="indent1"><span class="nm">(j)</span><p><span class="cl">Rejection:</span> Rava taught that if the wrong measure, weight or number was given, even less than a sixth, the sale is invalid (Rashbam. Rambam - the sale stands, but the additional amount must be given or returned.)</p></div>
<div class="indent1"><span class="nm">(k)</span><p><span class="cl">Answer #2:</span> We do not want merchants to lose money. (They normally profit a sixth. If measures increase a sixth, they will only lose their profit.)</p></div>
<div class="indent1"><span class="nm">(l)</span><p><span class="cl">Objection:</span> A merchant's income is from his profit. We should be concerned for his livelihood!</p></div>
<div class="indent1"><span class="nm">(m)</span><p><span class="cl">Answer #3 (Rav Chisda):</span> Chachamim expounded "Esrim Shekalim Chamishah v'Esrim Shekalim Asarah va'Chamishah Shekel ha'Maneh Yihyeh Lachem";</p></div>
<div class="indent2"><span class="nm">1.</span><p><span class="cl">Question:</span> This connotes that a Maneh (100 Dinarim, about a pound) is (60 Shekalim, i.e. 20 and 25 and 15), which is) 240 (Dinarim)!</p></div>
<div class="indent2"><span class="nm">2.</span><p><span class="cl">Answer (Rav Chisda):</span> We learn from this three things:</p></div>
<div class="indent3"><span class="nm">i.</span><p>The Maneh of Hekdesh is double a normal Maneh;</p></div>
<div class="indent3"><span class="nm">ii.</span><p>We may increase measures, but no more than a sixth. (A double Maneh should be 200 Dinarim, and the verse considers it 240);</p></div>
<div class="indent3"><span class="nm">iii.</span><p>The sixth is 'outer'. (The increase (40) is a sixth of the total (the new measure, 240), which equals a fifth of the old measure.)</p></div>
<div class="indent1"><span class="nm">(n)</span><p><span class="cl">Support (Ravina - Mishnah):</span> The Todah comes from five Yerushalmi Sa'im. This equals six Sa'im of the Midbar. (This shows that an outer sixth was added.)</p></div>

<div class="subject"><span class="nm">2)</span><p>TERUMAS LACHMEI TODAH</p></div>
<div class="indent1"><span class="nm">(a)</span><p><span class="cl">(Mishnah):</span> One loaf of each of the four kinds is taken to be Terumah - "v'Hikriv Mimenu Echad mi'Kol Korban Terumah la'Shem";</p></div>
<div class="indent2"><span class="nm">1.</span><p>"Echad" - a full loaf must be taken, not a piece. "Mi'Kol Korban" - all the Korbanos (kinds of bread) must be the same (in number). One may not separate from one kind to exempt another kind.</p></div>
<div class="indent2"><span class="nm">2.</span><p>"La'Kohen ha'Zorek Es Dam ha'Shelamim Lo Yihyeh" - the Kohen gets the Terumah, and the owner eats the remaining breads.</p></div>
<div class="indent1"><span class="nm">(b)</span><p><span class="cl">(Gemara - Beraisa):</span> "V'Hikriv Mimenu" connotes from Mechubar, i.e. the loaves must be together (Rashi Kesav Yad - in one Kli; Tosfos - touching) when Terumah is taken.</p></div>
<div class="indent2"><span class="nm">1.</span><p>"Echad" teaches that a full loaf must be taken. "Mi'Kol Korban" teaches that all the Korbanos must be the same. One may not separate from one kind to exempt another;</p></div>
<div class="indent2"><span class="nm">2.</span><p><span class="cl">Question:</span> It says that one loaf of each kind is made Terumah. How many loaves are there are of each kind?</p></div>
<div class="indent2"><span class="nm">3.</span><p><span class="cl">Answer:</span> It says here "Terumah", like it says about Terumas Ma'aser. There, one part in 10 is Terumah, and also here.</p></div>
<div class="indent2"><span class="nm">4.</span><p><span class="cl">Question:</span> Perhaps we should learn from Bikurim, which are also called Terumah. there, any amount suffices!</p></div>
<div class="indent2"><span class="nm">5.</span><p><span class="cl">Answer:</span> We learn Terumah (of Lachmei Todah) from Terumas Ma'aser, for no Terumah is taken after them, but after Bikurim, Terumah is taken from the remaining produce.</p></div>
<div class="indent2"><span class="nm">6.</span><p><span class="cl">Question:</span> Perhaps we should rather learn Lachmei Todah from Bikurim, for both of them must be eaten in a Kodesh place (Yerushalayim), but Terumas Ma'aser is permitted everywhere!</p></div>
<div class="indent2"><span class="nm">7.</span><p><span class="cl">Answer:</span> We learn from a Gezerah Shavah "Mimenu Terumah la'Shem" from Terumas Ma'aser.</p></div>
<div class="indent2"><span class="nm">8.</span><p><span class="cl">Question:</span> Indeed, this teaches that Terumah is one out of 10. How much Soles is used for each Chalah?</p></div>
<div class="indent2"><span class="nm">9.</span><p><span class="cl">Answer:</span> It says here "Lechem", like it says regarding Shtei ha'Lechem. Just like there each loaf is one Isaron, also here.</p></div>
<div class="indent2"><span class="nm">10.</span><p><span class="cl">Question:</span> Perhaps we should rather learn from Lechem ha'Panim. It is also called Lechem, and each loaf is two Esronim!</p></div>
<div class="indent2"><span class="nm">11.</span><p><span class="cl">Answer:</span> We learn Lachmei Todah from Shtei ha'Lechem, for both are Chametz brought with a Zevach.</p></div>
<div class="indent2"><span class="nm">12.</span><p><span class="cl">Question:</span> Perhaps we should rather learn Lachmei Todah from Lechem ha'Panim, for both may be brought from Eretz Yisrael or Chutz la'Aretz, and from Chodosh or old grain!</p></div>
<div class="indent2"><span class="nm">13.</span><p><span class="cl">Answer:</span> Regarding Shtei ha'Lechem it says "mi'Moshvoseichem Tavi'u Lechem Tenufah." Tavi'u is extra. (Before this, it says "v'Hikravtem".) It teaches that whatever you bring similar to this (i.e. Chametz) should be the same size, one Isaron per loaf.</p></div>
<div class="indent2"><span class="nm">14.</span><p><span class="cl">Question:</span> Perhaps it teaches that any other Chametz brought should be the same total size, i.e. two Esronim!</p></div>
<div class="indent2"><span class="nm">15.</span><p><span class="cl">Answer:</span> It says (about Shtei ha'Lechem) "Tihyenah" (to teach that 10 Esronim are used (altogether) for the Chametz of Lachmei Todah. This will be explained.)</p></div>
<div class="indent1"><span class="nm">(c)</span><p><span class="cl">Question:</span> This teaches that 10 Esronim are used (altogether) for the Chametz. What is the source that 10 are used for the Matzah?</p></div>
<div class="indent1"><span class="nm">(d)</span><p><span class="cl">Answer:</span> "Al Chalos Lechem Chametz" teaches that the Matzah has as much flour as the Chametz.</p></div>
<div class="indent1"><span class="nm">(e)</span><p><span class="cl">Suggestion:</span> Perhaps all the Matzah is baked the same way!</p></div>
<div class="indent1"><span class="nm">(f)</span><p><span class="cl">Rejection:</span> "...Chalos Matzos Belulos ba'Shemen u'Rekikei Matzos Meshuchim ba'Shamen v'Soles Murbeches" teaches that there are three kinds. A third of the 10 Esronim are used for each. Three Chalos are made from each Isaron;</p></div>
<div class="indent2"><span class="nm">1.</span><p>In all there are 40 Lachmei Todah. Four are given to the Kohen, and the owner eats the rest.</p></div>
<div class="indent1"><span class="nm">(g)</span><p><span class="cl">(Beraisa):</span> "V'Hikriv Mimenu" teaches that they are taken from Mechubar (when the loaves are together).</p></div>
<div class="indent1"><span class="nm">(h)</span><p><span class="cl">Question:</span> If so, we should similarly expound "v'Es Kol Chelbo Yarim Mimenu." If Chelev is removed after the Korban is dissected, how is this fulfilled?!</p></div>
<div class="indent1"><span class="nm">(i)</span><p><span class="cl">Answer:</span> Rav Chisda taught that the Korban is not dissected until the Eimurim are removed.</p></div>
<div class="indent1"><span class="nm">(j)</span><p><span class="cl">(Beraisa):</span> It says here "Terumah", like it says regarding Terumas Ma'aser...</p></div>
<div class="indent1"><span class="nm">(k)</span><p><span class="cl">Question:</span> Why don't we learn from Terumah taken from the spoils taken in the war with Midyan? (Rashi - this refers to what the Leviyim received from Bnei Yisrael's half, one part in 50; Rashi Kesav Yad - it refers to what the soldiers gave to the Kohanim, one part in 500.)</p></div>
<div class="indent1"><span class="nm">(l)</span><p><span class="cl">Answer:</span> We learn Terumas Lachmei Todah from Terumas Ma'aser, for both of these apply to all generations.</p></div>
<div class="indent1"><span class="nm">(m)</span><p><span class="cl">Question:</span> Why don't we learn from Chalah, which is called Terumah? (Rashi - we would learn one part in 48, the amount that bakers must give; Rashi Kesav Yad - we would learn a 24th, like regular people give.)</p></div>
<div class="indent1"><span class="nm">(n)</span><p><span class="cl">Answer (Tana d'Vei R. Yishmael):</span> We learn Terumas Lachmei Todah from Terumas Ma'aser. Regarding both of these it says "Mimenu Terumas Hash-m".</p></div>
<div class="indent1"><span class="nm">(o)</span><p><span class="cl">Question (Rava):</span> If a Zar ate Terumas Lachmei Todah, is he Chayav Misah bi'Yedei Shamayim (if he ate b'Mezid), and does he add a fifth (when paying for it, if he ate b'Shogeg)?</p></div>
<div class="indent2"><span class="nm">1.</span><p>Since it is equated to Terumas Ma'aser, Misah and Chomesh apply;</p></div>
<div class="indent2"><span class="nm">2.</span><p>Or, perhaps the exclusions "Vo" and "Chamishiso" teach that these laws apply to Terumah, but not to Terumas Lachmei Todah.</p></div>
<div class="indent1"><span class="nm">(p)</span><p><span class="cl">Question:</span> If Terumas Lachmei Todah became mixed with other food, is it Medame'a (forbid the mixture to Zarim)?</p></div>
<div class="indent1"><span class="nm">(q)</span><p>These questions are not resolved.</p></div>
