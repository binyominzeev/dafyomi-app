<div class="subject"><span class="nm">1)</span><p>IS ZERIKAH NEEDED FOR KIDUSH?</p></div>
<div class="indent1"><span class="nm">(a)</span><p><span class="cl">(Beraisa):</span> The two lambs are Mekadesh only through Shechitah:</p></div>
<div class="indent2"><span class="nm">1.</span><p>If they were slaughtered Lishmah and Zerikah was Lishmah, they are Mekadesh the bread;</p></div>
<div class="indent2"><span class="nm">2.</span><p>If Shechitah and Zerikah were Lo Lishmah, they are not Mekadesh;</p></div>
<div class="indent2"><span class="nm">3.</span><p>Rebbi says, if Shechitah was Lishmah and Zerikah was Lo Lishmah, the bread is Kadosh and not Kadosh (this will be explained);</p></div>
<div class="indent2"><span class="nm">4.</span><p>R. Elazar b'Rebbi Shimon says, it is not Kadosh unless Shechitah and Zerikah were both Lishmah.</p></div>
<div class="indent1"><span class="nm">(b)</span><p><span class="cl">Question:</span> What is Rebbi's reason?</p></div>
<div class="indent1"><span class="nm">(c)</span><p><span class="cl">Answer:</span> "V'Es ha'Ayil Ya'aseh Zevach Shelamim la'Shem Al Sal ha'Matzos" teaches that Zevichah (Shechitah) is Mekadesh (Lachmei Nazir. We learn Shtei ha'Lechem from them.)</p></div>
<div class="indent1"><span class="nm">(d)</span><p>R. Elazar b'Rebbi Shimon learns from "Ya'aseh" - all the Asiyos (actions, i.e. including Zerikah) are Mekadesh.</p></div>
<div class="indent1"><span class="nm">(e)</span><p><span class="cl">Question:</span> How does Rebbi expound "Ya'aseh"?</p></div>
<div class="indent1"><span class="nm">(f)</span><p><span class="cl">Answer:</span> Had it said 'Zevach Ya'aseh', Rebbi would agree (that even after Zevichah, other actions are needed);</p></div>
<div class="indent2"><span class="nm">1.</span><p>However, it says "Ya'aseh Zevach", teaching that the crucial action is Shechitah.</p></div>
<div class="indent1"><span class="nm">(g)</span><p><span class="cl">Question:</span> How does R. Elazar expound Zevach?</p></div>
<div class="indent1"><span class="nm">(h)</span><p><span class="cl">Answer:</span> That teaches R. Yochanan's law:</p></div>
<div class="indent2"><span class="nm">1.</span><p><span class="cl">(R. Yochanan):</span> All agree that there must be bread (Tosfos - in the Azarah) at the time of Shechitah.</p></div>
<div class="indent1"><span class="nm">(i)</span><p><span class="cl">Question:</span> What is the meaning of 'the bread is Kadosh and not Kadosh?'</p></div>
<div class="indent1"><span class="nm">(j)</span><p><span class="cl">Answer #1 (Abaye):</span> It is Kadosh, but not fully Kadosh;</p></div>
<div class="indent1"><span class="nm">(k)</span><p><span class="cl">Answer #2 (Rava):</span> It is Kadosh, but it is not permitted (to Kohanim).</p></div>
<div class="indent1"><span class="nm">(l)</span><p><span class="cl">Question:</span> (Abaye agrees that it is not permitted to Kohanim.) What is the difference between these answers?</p></div>
<div class="indent1"><span class="nm">(m)</span><p><span class="cl">Answer:</span> They argue about whether it is Tofes (transfers its Kedushah to) Pidyono (money used to redeem it);</p></div>
<div class="indent2"><span class="nm">1.</span><p><span class="cl">Version #1 (Rashi):</span> Abaye holds that it is Tofes Pidyono (it only has Kedushas Damim, i.e. monetary Kedushah, so it can be redeemed). Rava holds that it is not (it has Kedushas ha'Guf, i.e. to be offered).</p></div>
<div class="indent2"><span class="nm">2.</span><p><span class="cl">Version #2 (Tosfos):</span> Abaye holds that it is not Tofes Pidyono (for its Kedushah is weak), Rava holds that it is Tofes.</p></div>
<div class="indent1"><span class="nm">(n)</span><p><span class="cl">Question:</span> Granted, according to Rava, Rebbi and R. Elazar argue about whether or not it is not Tofes Pidyono. (R. Elazar says that it is (Rashi; Tosfos - not));</p></div>
<div class="indent2"><span class="nm">1.</span><p>According to Abaye, what do they argue about? (Rebbi says that it is (Rashi; Tosfos - not) Tofes Pidyono. All the more so R. Elazar, who says that it is less Kadosh, says so!)</p></div>
<div class="indent1"><span class="nm">(o)</span><p><span class="cl">Answer:</span> Rebbi holds that it is Nifsal if it leaves the Azarah. R. Elazar holds that it is not.</p></div>
<div class="subject"><span class="nm">2)</span><p>DOES ZERIKAH LO LISHMAH PERMIT THE BREAD?</p></div>
<div class="indent1"><span class="nm">(a)</span><p><span class="cl">Question (Rav Shmuel bar Rav Yitzchak):</span> If Kivsei Atzeres were slaughtered Lishmah and Zerikah was Lo Lishmah, may the bread be eaten?</p></div>
<div class="indent2"><span class="nm">1.</span><p><span class="cl">Question:</span> According to which Tana does he ask?</p></div>
<div class="indent3"><span class="nm">i.</span><p>He does not ask according to R. Elazar, who says that Zerikah is Mekadesh. (Surely, it may not be eaten!)</p></div>
<div class="indent3"><span class="nm">ii.</span><p>He does not ask according to Rebbi. Abaye and Rava agree that Rebbi forbids eating it!</p></div>
<div class="indent2"><span class="nm">2.</span><p><span class="cl">Answer:</span> He asks according to R. Akiva;</p></div>
<div class="indent3"><span class="nm">i.</span><p><span class="cl">(R. Yirmeyah bar Aba's father - Beraisa - R. Eliezer):</span> If Shtei ha'Lechem left the Azarah between Shechitah and Zerikah of the two lambs, and Zerikah was with intent Chutz li'Zmano, the bread is not Pigul;</p></div>
<div class="indent3"><span class="nm">ii.</span><p>R. Akiva says, it is Pigul.</p></div>
<div class="indent2"><span class="nm">3.</span><p><span class="cl">(Rav Sheshes):</span> These Tana'im hold like Rebbi, who says that Shechitah is Mekadesh;</p></div>
<div class="indent3"><span class="nm">i.</span><p>Each holds like he taught elsewhere. R. Eliezer holds that Zerikah does not take effect on Yotzei, and R. Akiva holds that it does:</p></div>
<div class="bbbline">47b----------------------------------------47b</p></div>
<div class="indent3"><span class="nm">ii.</span><p><span class="cl">(Mishnah - R. Eliezer):</span> If Eimurim of Kodshim Kalim left the Azarah before Zerikah, one is not liable for them for the  following: Me'ilah, Pigul, Nosar and Tamei;</p></div>
<div class="indent3"><span class="nm">iii.</span><p>R. Akiva says, all of these apply to them.</p></div>
<div class="indent2"><span class="nm">4.</span><p><span class="cl">Formulation of Question (a):</span> Just like Zerikah Chutz li'Zmano is Mefagel the bread as if it was Kosher (even though it was Yotzei; some texts say, as if it was meat), Zerikah Lo Lishmah permits the bread (as if it was Kosher/meat);</p></div>
<div class="indent2"><span class="nm">5.</span><p>Or, perhaps we consider it to be Kosher (or meat) to be stringent, but not to be lenient!</p></div>
<div class="indent1"><span class="nm">(b)</span><p><span class="cl">Question (Rav Papa):</span> We need not say that R. Eliezer and R. Akiva argue about Zerikah at a time when Shtei ha'Lechem are outside;</p></div>
<div class="indent2"><span class="nm">1.</span><p>Perhaps all agree that it does not take effect. They argue about when they were returned to the Azarah before Zerikah;</p></div>
<div class="indent2"><span class="nm">2.</span><p>R. Eliezer holds like Rebbi, who says that Shechitah is Mekadesh. They were Nifsalim through Yotzei (even according to Abaye, therefore Pigul cannot apply to them);</p></div>
<div class="indent2"><span class="nm">3.</span><p>R. Akiva holds like R. Elazar b'Rebbi Shimon, who says that Shechitah is not Mekadesh. They were not Nifsalim through Yotzei (therefore they can become Pigul).</p></div>
<div class="indent1"><span class="nm">(c)</span><p><span class="cl">Objection:</span> We cannot explain this way!</p></div>
<div class="indent2"><span class="nm">1.</span><p>Granted, if R. Akiva holds like Rebbi, Shechitah is Mekadesh, and Zerikah makes Pigul;</p></div>
<div class="indent2"><span class="nm">2.</span><p>However, if R. Akiva holds like R. Elazar, Shechitah is not Mekadesh, so Zerikah cannot make Pigul!</p></div>
<div class="indent3"><span class="nm">i.</span><p><span class="cl">(Rav Gidal):</span> Zerikas Pigul (i.e. with intent Chutz li'Zmano) does not cause Me'ilah to apply, nor does it uproot Me'ilah (in situations where a Kosher Zerikah would):</p></div>
<div class="indent3"><span class="nm">ii.</span><p>It does not cause Me'ilah to apply to Eimurim of Kodshim Kalim, it does not uproot Me'ilah from meat of Kodshei Kodoshim. (This shows that it is not considered Zerikah. Similarly, if the bread was not Kodesh before Zerikah, Zerikah cannot make it Kodesh and Pigul!)</p></div>
<div class="indent1"><span class="nm">(d)</span><p><span class="cl">Answer:</span> We can explain like Rav Papa, for Rav Gidal was refuted.</p></div>
<div class="subject"><span class="nm">3)</span><p>IS ZERIKAH PERMITTED LO LISHMAH?</p></div>
<div class="indent1"><span class="nm">(a)</span><p><span class="cl">Question (R. Yirmeyah):</span> If Kivsei Atzeres were slaughtered Lishmah and the bread was lost (the lambs are Pesulim for Kivsei Atzeres, for Shechitah was Zokek), may Zerikah be done Lo Lishmah (l'Shem Shelamim) to permit the meat?</p></div>
<div class="indent1"><span class="nm">(b)</span><p><span class="cl">Answer (R. Zeira):</span> No. We never find that something is Pasul Lishmah and Kosher Lo Lishmah.</p></div>
<div class="indent1"><span class="nm">(c)</span><p><span class="cl">Objection:</span> We do! Korban Pesach is Pasul Lishmah before noon of Erev Pesach, but it is Kosher Lo Lishmah (l'Shem Shelamim!)</p></div>
<div class="indent1"><span class="nm">(d)</span><p><span class="cl">Clarification (R. Zeira):</span> I meant, we never find that something that was Kosher Lishmah and was Nidcheh, and is Pasul Lishmah, but Kosher Lo Lishmah.</p></div>
<div class="indent1"><span class="nm">(e)</span><p><span class="cl">Objection:</span> We do! Korban Pesach was Kosher Lishmah on Erev Pesach. (If it was not offered,) it was Nidcheh, after Pesach it is Pasul Lishmah and Kosher Lo Lishmah (l'Shem Shelamim)!</p></div>
<div class="indent1"><span class="nm">(f)</span><p><span class="cl">Clarification (R. Zeira):</span> I meant that we never find that something that was Kosher Lishmah, was slaughtered Lishmah, was Nidcheh and is Pasul (if Nizrak) Lishmah, but is Kosher Lo Lishmah.</p></div>
<div class="indent1"><span class="nm">(g)</span><p><span class="cl">Objection:</span> We do, i.e. Todah! (If after Shechitah the bread was lost, it is Pasul l'Shem Todah, but it is Kosher l'Shem Shelamim.)</p></div>
<div class="indent1"><span class="nm">(h)</span><p><span class="cl">Answer:</span> Todah is different, for it is called Shelamim. (Therefore, l'Shem Shelamim is called Lishmah.)</p></div>
