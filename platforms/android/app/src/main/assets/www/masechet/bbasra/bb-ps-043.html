<p class="bas subject"><span class="nm">1)</span>ONE WHO MAY GAIN FROM HIS TESTIMONY</p>
<p class="bas indent1"><span class="nm">(a)</span><span class="cl">(Shmuel):</span> Reuven can testify for his partner Shimon.</p>
<p class="bas indent1"><span class="nm">(b)</span><span class="cl">Question:</span> Why is this permitted? The testimony affects Reuven!</p>
<p class="bas indent1"><span class="nm">(c)</span><span class="cl">Answer:</span> The case is, Reuven wrote to Shimon 'I have no claim to this field' (the one he testifies about).</p>
<p class="bas indent1"><span class="nm">(d)</span><span class="cl">Question (Beraisa):</span> If Levi wrote to Yehudah 'I have no claim to this field', 'I have no business in it', or my hand is removed from it', this has no effect.</p>
<p class="bas indent1"><span class="nm">(e)</span><span class="cl">Answer:</span> The case is, Shimon made a Kinyan (Chalipin) to make Reuven's pardon binding.</p>
<p class="bas indent1"><span class="nm">(f)</span><span class="cl">Question:</span> Still, the testimony affects Reuven! If we establish that the property used to belong to them, Reuven's creditor (from before he pardoned his share) can collect from it!</p>
<p class="bas indent2"><span class="nm">1.</span><span class="cl">(Ravin bar Shmuel):</span> If one sells his field without Achrayus, he cannot testify about it (to establish ownership), since this can enable his creditor to collect it.</p>
<p class="bas indent1"><span class="nm">(g)</span><span class="cl">Answer:</span> The case is, Reuven accepted Achrayus for his share. (Therefore, it does not matter to him whether or not a creditor takes it, for then he will owe Shimon).</p>
<p class="bas indent1"><span class="nm">(h)</span><span class="cl">Question:</span> For whom (that might take the field) did Reuven accept Achrayus?</p>
<p class="bas indent2"><span class="nm">1.</span>If he accepted for anyone who claims 'this was my field', the testimony saves Reuven from having to compensate Shimon!</p>
<p class="bas indent1"><span class="nm">(i)</span><span class="cl">Answer:</span> Rather, Reuven accepted Achrayus if his creditor will collect it.</p>
<p class="bas indent1"><span class="nm">(j)</span><span class="cl">Question:</span> This does not enable him to testify!</p>
<p class="bas indent2"><span class="nm">1.</span><span class="cl">(Beraisa):</span> If the Sefer Torah of a city was stolen, people of the city cannot judge or testify about it (since it affects them).</p>
<p class="bas indent2"><span class="nm">2.</span>If obligating oneself (so he will not benefit) helps, two should forfeit their shares in it and judge the case!</p>
<p class="bas indent1"><span class="nm">(k)</span><span class="cl">Answer:</span> A Sefer Torah is different, for everyone (who will remain in the city) must hear it read.</p>
<p class="bas indent1"><span class="nm">(l)</span><span class="cl">Question (Beraisa):</span> If Reuven (allegedly) pledged to give a Maneh (money) for needs of the city, people of the city cannot judge or testify about it.</p>
<p class="bas indent2"><span class="nm">1.</span>Why don't we say that two can forfeit their shares in it and judge the case?</p>
<p class="bas indent1"><span class="nm">(m)</span><span class="cl">Answer:</span> The case is, he pledged to give the Maneh to buy a Sefer Torah (all must hear it).</p>
<p class="bas indent1"><span class="nm">(n)</span><span class="cl">Question (Beraisa):</span> If Reuven (allegedly) pledged to give a Maneh for poor people of the city, people of the city cannot judge or testify about it.</p>
<p class="bas indent2"><span class="nm">1.</span><span class="cl">Question:</span> Only the poor would receive it. Why is everyone disqualified?</p>
<p class="bas indent2"><span class="nm">2.</span><span class="cl">Answer #1:</span> The Beraisa should say that poor people of the city cannot judge or testify about it.</p>
<p class="bas indent2"><span class="nm">3.</span>Why don't we say that two can forfeit their shares in it and judge the case?</p>
<p class="bas indent1"><span class="nm">(o)</span><span class="cl">Answer #1:</span> The case is, he pledged to give the Maneh to buy a Sefer Torah.</p>
<p class="bas indent2"><span class="nm">1.</span><span class="cl">Question:</span> The Beraisa says that he pledged to give the poor!</p>
<p class="bas indent2"><span class="nm">2.</span><span class="cl">Answer:</span> People without a Sefer Torah are considered poor.</p>
<p class="bas indent1"><span class="nm">(p)</span><span class="cl">Answer #2 (to Questions (n) and n:1):</span> Really, he pledged to give to the poor. This would benefit even the rich, for it lightens their responsibility to support the poor.</p>
<p class="bas indent1"><span class="nm">(q)</span><span class="cl">Question:</span> What is the case?</p>
<p class="bas indent2"><span class="nm">1.</span>If everyone was assigned to give a certain amount for the poor, one can give his quota, and then judge the case (for he does not stand to gain)!</p>
<p class="bas indent1"><span class="nm">(r)</span><span class="cl">Answer #1:</span> The case is, it was not assigned how much each person must give.</p>
<p class="bas indent1"><span class="nm">(s)</span><span class="cl">Answer #2:</span> It was assigned how much each person must give. Still, the judges gain if the poor will receive a Maneh, for then they are less likely to need more Tzedakah later.</p>
<p class="bas subject"><span class="nm">2)</span>PARTNERS WHO GUARD FOR EACH OTHER</p>
<p class="bas indent1"><span class="nm">(a)</span><span class="cl">(Shmuel):</span> A partner is considered a Shomer Sachar when watching the common property.</p>
<p class="bas bbbline">43b----------------------------------------43b</p>
<p class="bas indent1"><span class="nm">(b)</span><span class="cl">Question:</span> Why is he liable? (Each guards part of the common property for the other, so) this is Shemirah b'Ba'alim (for one's employee. One is exempt for this!</p>
<p class="bas indent1"><span class="nm">(c)</span><span class="cl">Answer (Rav Papa):</span> The case is, they alternate. Each day, one partner watches all the property.</p>
<p class="bas subject"><span class="nm">3)</span>TESTIMONY THAT MAY HELP THE WITNESS</p>
<p class="bas indent1"><span class="nm">(a)</span><span class="cl">(Beraisa):</span> If Reuven sold a house or field, he cannot testify about it, for there is Achrayus (therefore, he is partial);</p>
<p class="bas indent2"><span class="nm">1.</span>If he sold a cow or garment, he can testify about it, for there is no Achrayus.</p>
<p class="bas indent1"><span class="nm">(b)</span><span class="cl">Question:</span> What is the difference between the clauses? (Why does the Tana assume that there is Achrayus for a house or field, but not for a cow or garment?)</p>
<p class="bas indent1"><span class="nm">(c)</span><span class="cl">Answer #1 (Rav Sheshes):</span> In the Reisha, Reuven stole Shimon's field and sold it to Levi, and Yehudah claims that it was his;</p>
<p class="bas indent2"><span class="nm">1.</span>The Tana teaches that Shimon cannot testify for Levi, for this will help Shimon to get back his field.</p>
<p class="bas indent2"><span class="nm">2.</span><span class="cl">Question:</span> If he testifies that it is Levi's, he cannot later claim that it is his!</p>
<p class="bas indent2"><span class="nm">3.</span><span class="cl">Answer:</span> He testifies, 'I know that Yehudah does not own the field'.</p>
<p class="bas indent2"><span class="nm">4.</span><span class="cl">Question:</span> If Shimon can (bring proof to) get his field back from Levi, he could also get it from Yehudah. Why would he prefer that Beis Din give the field to Levi?</p>
<p class="bas indent2"><span class="nm">5.</span><span class="cl">Answer #1:</span> Perhaps Yehudah is powerful, and it is easier to oppose Levi in Beis Din than Yehudah.</p>
<p class="bas indent2"><span class="nm">6.</span><span class="cl">Answer #2:</span> Shimon and Yehudah each have witnesses supporting his claim to the field;</p>
<p class="bas indent3"><span class="nm">i.</span>In such a case, the land remains with the Muchzak. Therefore, Shimon does not want Yehudah to become Muchzak.</p>
