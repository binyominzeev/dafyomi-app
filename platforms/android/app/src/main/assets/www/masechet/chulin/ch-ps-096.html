<div class="indent1"><span class="nm">(a)</span><p><span class="cl">(Rava):</span> I used to think that a Siman is better than Tevi'as Ayin (recognition), for we return a lost object (to anyone) based on a Siman, but only a Chacham receives through Tevi'as Ayin.</p></div>
<div class="indent1"><span class="nm">(b)</span><p><span class="cl">Retraction (Rava):</span> The above teachings show that recognition is Adif. (Mesores ha'Shas points to Tosfos Berachos 50a DH Ela, who says that sometimes 'Adif' does not mean 'better', rather, 'as good.')</p></div>
<div class="indent1"><span class="nm">(c)</span><p><span class="cl">Support #1 - Question:</span> How is a blind man (or any man, at night in the dark) permitted to cohabit with his wife? (Perhaps it is a different woman!)</p></div>
<div class="indent2"><span class="nm">1.</span><p><span class="cl">Answer:</span> Surely, we rely on Tevi'as Ayin (recognition) of her voice.</p></div>
<div class="indent2"><span class="nm">2.</span><p>Likewise, we may rely on visual recognition!</p></div>
<div class="indent1"><span class="nm">(d)</span><p><span class="cl">Support #2 (R. Yitzchak brei d'Rav Mesharshiya):</span> If two witnesses testify about a murder:</p></div>
<div class="indent2"><span class="nm">1.</span><p>If they do not recognize the murderer but they know Simanim on his body and clothing, we do not kill him;</p></div>
<div class="indent2"><span class="nm">2.</span><p>If they recognize him, we kill him.</p></div>
<div class="indent1"><span class="nm">(e)</span><p><span class="cl">Support #3 (Rav Ashi):</span> If a man asks a messenger to summons Ploni, and he gives Simanim describing Ploni, he is unsure if the messenger will find him;</p></div>
<div class="indent2"><span class="nm">1.</span><p>If the messenger recognizes Ploni, he will surely find him.</p></div>
<div class="subject"><span class="nm">2)</span><p>REMOVING THE GID</p></div>
<div class="indent1"><span class="nm">(a)</span><p><span class="cl">(Mishnah):</span> When removing the Gid ha'Nasheh, one must remove all of it;</p></div>
<div class="indent1"><span class="nm">(b)</span><p>R. Yehudah says, he must remove (only) enough to fulfill the Mitzvah of removing it.</p></div>
<div class="indent1"><span class="nm">(c)</span><p>If one eats a k'Zayis of the Gid he gets 40 lashes;</p></div>
<div class="indent1"><span class="nm">(d)</span><p>If he ate a whole Gid, even if it is not a k'Zayis, he is lashed.</p></div>
<div class="indent1"><span class="nm">(e)</span><p>If he ate a k'Zayis of each Gid, he gets 80 lashes;</p></div>
<div class="indent1"><span class="nm">(f)</span><p>R. Yehudah says, he gets 40 lashes.</p></div>
<div class="indent1"><span class="nm">(g)</span><p><span class="cl">(Gemara):</span> Bar Piyuli was removing the Gid for Shmuel. He was just cutting off the top.</p></div>
<div class="indent2"><span class="nm">1.</span><p><span class="cl">Shmuel:</span> You must cut deeper. Had I not seen, you would have fed me Isur!</p></div>
<div class="indent1"><span class="nm">(h)</span><p>Bar Piyuli dropped the knife. Shmuel consoled him. 'I am not angry. The one who instructed you holds like R. Yehudah.'</p></div>
<div class="indent1"><span class="nm">(i)</span><p><span class="cl">(Rav Sheshes):</span> Bar Piyuli was removing what R. Yehudah requires to remove mid'Oraisa.</p></div>
<div class="indent1"><span class="nm">(j)</span><p><span class="cl">Objection:</span> This implies that he did not remove what R. Yehudah forbids mid'Rabanan. Who would instruct him to do so?!</p></div>
<div class="indent1"><span class="nm">(k)</span><p><span class="cl">Correction (Rav Sheshes):</span> Rather, Bar Piyuli was removing what must be removed mid'Oraisa. He left what R. Meir forbids mid'Rabanan;</p></div>
<div class="indent2"><span class="nm">1.</span><p>R. Yehudah permits those remnants even mid'Rabanan.</p></div>
<div class="indent1"><span class="nm">(l)</span><p><span class="cl">(Mishnah):</span> If one eats the Gid...</p></div>
<div class="indent1"><span class="nm">(m)</span><p><span class="cl">(Shmuel):</span> The Torah forbids only the part of the Gid on the Kaf (the meat at the end of the thigh) - "Al Kaf ha'Yarech."</p></div>
<div class="indent1"><span class="nm">(n)</span><p><span class="cl">(Rav Papa):</span> Tana'im argue about this;</p></div>
<div class="indent2"><span class="nm">1.</span><p><span class="cl">(Beraisa):</span> If one ate a whole Gid, even if it is not a k'Zayis, he is lashed;</p></div>
<div class="indent2"><span class="nm">2.</span><p>R. Yehudah says, he is lashed only if it is a k'Zayis.</p></div>
<div class="indent3"><span class="nm">i.</span><p>Chachamim are Mechayev for less than a k'Zayis, because it is a Briyah (a complete creation);</p></div>
<div class="bbbline">96b----------------------------------------96b</p></div>
<div class="indent3"><span class="nm">ii.</span><p>R. Yehudah says, the Torah forbids eating the Gid. (Less than a k'Zayis is not considered eating.)</p></div>
<div class="indent3"><span class="nm">iii.</span><p><span class="cl">Chachamim:</span> No. It says "Lo Yochlu" to punish for a k'Zayis of a large Gid (but not to exempt eating an entire small Gid.)</p></div>
<div class="indent3"><span class="nm">iv.</span><p><span class="cl">R. Yehudah:</span> "Asher Al Kaf ha'Yarech" teaches this! (One is liable for eating just the part on the Kaf.)</p></div>
<div class="indent3"><span class="nm">v.</span><p><span class="cl">Chachamim:</span> No, that teaches Shmuel's law. (Only the part on the Kaf is forbidden.)</p></div>
<div class="indent3"><span class="nm">vi.</span><p><span class="cl">R. Yehudah:</span> It says "ha'Yarech" - the Gid is forbidden throughout the entire thigh.</p></div>
<div class="indent3"><span class="nm">vii.</span><p><span class="cl">Chachamim:</span> No, that teaches that the (inner) Gid which stretches throughout the entire thigh is forbidden.</p></div>
<div class="indent1"><span class="nm">(o)</span><p><span class="cl">Question:</span> "Kaf" is needed to permit the Gid of a bird! (It has no Kaf.)</p></div>
<div class="indent1"><span class="nm">(p)</span><p><span class="cl">Answer:</span> It says "Kaf" twice in the Parshah.</p></div>
<div class="subject"><span class="nm">3)</span><p>A GID THAT WAS COOKED WITH MEAT</p></div>
<div class="indent1"><span class="nm">(a)</span><p><span class="cl">(Mishnah):</span> If a thigh was cooked with the Gid ha'Nasheh inside:</p></div>
<div class="indent2"><span class="nm">1.</span><p>If it is Nosen Ta'am (imparts taste) to the thigh, the thigh is forbidden.</p></div>
<div class="indent2"><span class="nm">2.</span><p>If meat and turnips (of volumes like those of the Gid and thigh, respectively) were cooked together and the meat would give Ta'am to the turnips, we (are stringent, and) assume that the Gid gives Ta'am to the thigh.</p></div>
<div class="indent1"><span class="nm">(b)</span><p>If the Gid ha'Nasheh was cooked with permitted Gidim -</p></div>
<div class="indent2"><span class="nm">1.</span><p>If we recognize the Gid ha'Nasheh, we remove it, and the others are permitted if the Gid ha'Nasheh was not Nosen Ta'am (to them);</p></div>
<div class="indent2"><span class="nm">2.</span><p>If we cannot recognize the Gid ha'Nasheh, they are all forbidden.</p></div>
<div class="indent2"><span class="nm">3.</span><p>The liquid in the pot is forbidden if the Gid ha'Nasheh was Nosen Ta'am.</p></div>
<div class="indent1"><span class="nm">(c)</span><p>The same applies to a piece of Nevelah or a Tamei fish cooked with other pieces -</p></div>
<div class="indent2"><span class="nm">1.</span><p>If we recognize the forbidden piece, we remove it, and the rest are permitted if the Isur was too small to give Ta'am;</p></div>
<div class="indent2"><span class="nm">2.</span><p>If we cannot recognize the Isur, all the pieces are forbidden.</p></div>
<div class="indent1"><span class="nm">(d)</span><p><span class="cl">(Gemara - Shmuel):</span> This is only if the thigh was cooked (with water). If it was roasted, it is permitted (but one may not eat the meat around the Gid).</p></div>
<div class="indent1"><span class="nm">(e)</span><p><span class="cl">Question:</span> Rav Huna taught that if a kid that was roasted with its Chelev, even the ear is forbidden (because the Chelev gives Ta'am to the entire kid)!</p></div>
<div class="indent1"><span class="nm">(f)</span><p><span class="cl">Answer:</span> Chelev is different. It bubbles up and spreads.</p></div>
