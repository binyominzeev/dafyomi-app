<p class="bas subject"><span class="nm">1)</span>THE KEDUSHAH OF KETORES</p>
<p class="bas indent1"><span class="nm">(a)</span><span class="cl">Question (Rabah):</span> If Ketores has only monetary Kedushah, a Tevul Yom (one who immersed from Tum'ah today; he will be fully Tahor at nightfall) should not disqualify it!</p>
<p class="bas indent2"><span class="nm">1.</span><span class="cl">(Beraisa):</span> If Ketores was put in the grinder, if a Tevul Yom touches it, he disqualifies it.</p>
<p class="bas indent1"><span class="nm">(b)</span><span class="cl">Suggestion:</span> Perhaps a Tevul Yom disqualifies things with monetary Kedushah!</p>
<p class="bas indent1"><span class="nm">(c)</span><span class="cl">Rejection (Mishnah):</span> From the time one is Makdish a Minchah (flour-offering), Me'ilah applies to it. When it is put in a Keli Shares (service vessel), it gets more Kedushah. It becomes disqualified if a Tevul Yom or Mechushar Kipurim (one who was Tamei, and his Taharah will be complete when he brings a Korban) touches it, or if left overnight;</p>
<p class="bas indent2"><span class="nm">1.</span>The latter two laws apply only after it was put in a Keli Shares, but not before!</p>
<p class="bas indent2"><span class="nm">2.</span><span class="cl">Counter-question (Rav Chisda):</span> If Ketores has Kedushas ha'Guf (it is considered destined to be used for the Avodah), it should be disqualified if left overnight!</p>
<p class="bas indent3"><span class="nm">i.</span><span class="cl">(Mishnah):</span> Me'ilah applies to the following from the time of Hekdesh: the Kometz (the handful taken from a Minchah and burned on the Altar), frankincense, Ketores, the Minchah of a Kohen, the daily Minchah of an anointed Kohen Gadol, and the Minchah that accompanies an animal Korban;</p>
<p class="bas indent3"><span class="nm">ii.</span>After they are put in a Keli Shares, they are disqualified if touched by a Tevul Yom or Mechushar Kipurim, or if left overnight.</p>
<p class="bas indent3"><span class="nm">iii.</span><span class="cl">Inference:</span> Before they are put in a Keli Shares, they are not disqualified if left overnight!</p>
<p class="bas indent2"><span class="nm">3.</span><span class="cl">Answer (Rabah):</span> Ketores is different. The Torah instructs to make it once for the entire year, so mid'Oraisa it is not disqualified if left overnight (Tosfos - until put in the pan in which it is burned).</p>
<p class="bas subject"><span class="nm">2)</span>HEKDESH BUYS ON CONDITION</p>
<p class="bas indent1"><span class="nm">(a)</span><span class="cl">Question:</span> We still have not answered the question (4:b Daf 10b. Why can Tam Korbanos (or Ketores) be redeemed? Did the Kedushah vanish?!)</p>
<p class="bas indent1"><span class="nm">(b)</span><span class="cl">Answer (Rabah):</span> Beis Din (Hekdesh) purchases things needed for the Avodah on condition that anything that is not needed does not get Kedushas ha'Guf.</p>
<p class="bas indent1"><span class="nm">(c)</span><span class="cl">Question (Abaye):</span> You yourself taught that if one is Makdish a male animal to (sell it and use the money to) buy an Olah, the animal gets Kedushas ha'Guf!</p>
<p class="bas indent1"><span class="nm">(d)</span><span class="cl">Answer (Rabah):</span> That is because it was Hukdash for something for which it is Ra'uy (appropriate);</p>
<p class="bas indent2"><span class="nm">1.</span>However, if it was Hukdash to (sell it and use the money to) buy Nesachim (the accompanying Minchah), for which it is not Ra'uy, it does not get Kedushas ha'Guf.</p>
<p class="bas indent1"><span class="nm">(e)</span><span class="cl">Question (Abaye - Mishnah - R. Yehudah):</span> If the (inner) bull or goat of Yom Kipur was lost, and another was taken in its place and the lost animal was found, we leave it to die;</p>
<p class="bas bbbline">11b----------------------------------------11b</p>
<p class="bas indent2"><span class="nm">1.</span>The same apples to goats that atone for (a mistaken ruling of the Sanhedrin that caused most of Yisrael to transgress) idolatry.</p>
<p class="bas indent1"><span class="nm">(f)</span>R. Elazar and R. Shimon say that it is left to graze until it gets a Mum (blemish). It is redeemed, and the money goes to Nedavah (to buy Olos for the Tzibur to bring when the Altar is idle);</p>
<p class="bas indent2"><span class="nm">1.</span>(If an individual's Chatas cannot be offered, it must die, but) the Tzibur's Chatas is never left to die.</p>
<p class="bas indent2"><span class="nm">2.</span><span class="cl">Summation of question:</span> If Hekdesh purchases things for the Avodah on condition, we should redeem it Tam!</p>
<p class="bas indent1"><span class="nm">(g)</span><span class="cl">Answer (Rabah):</span> These are uncommon Korbanos (and it is rare that one would be lost). Hekdesh does not stipulate about them.</p>
<p class="bas indent1"><span class="nm">(h)</span><span class="cl">Question (Abaye):</span> It is uncommon that we will redeem a red heifer because a nicer one was found, yet Hekdesh stipulates about this!</p>
<p class="bas indent2"><span class="nm">1.</span><span class="cl">(Beraisa):</span> A red heifer is redeemed if it is disqualified in any way, if it died, if it was slaughtered (in the wrong place), or if a nicer red heifer was found;</p>
<p class="bas indent2"><span class="nm">2.</span>If it was slaughtered in the proper place (facing the entrance to the Heichal), it may never be redeemed.</p>
<p class="bas indent1"><span class="nm">(i)</span><span class="cl">Answer #1 (Rabah):</span> The red heifer is different, since it is Hekdesh Bedek ha'Bayis (it is not offered on the Altar), so even if Hekdesh did not stipulate, it can be redeemed Tam.</p>
<p class="bas indent2"><span class="nm">1.</span><span class="cl">Question:</span> Why can it be redeemed after it died or was slaughtered? It must be stood up and evaluated!</p>
<p class="bas indent2"><span class="nm">2.</span><span class="cl">Answer:</span> The Beraisa is R. Shimon, who says that only Kedushas ha'Guf must be stood up and evaluated (before redemption), and not Bedek ha'Bayis.</p>
<p class="bas indent2"><span class="nm">3.</span><span class="cl">Question (end of the Beraisa):</span> If it was slaughtered in the proper place, it may never be redeemed.</p>
<p class="bas indent3"><span class="nm">i.</span><span class="cl">(Beraisa - R. Shimon):</span> The red heifer receives Tum'ah because there was a time when it was Ra'uy (to be eaten).</p>
<p class="bas indent3"><span class="nm">ii.</span><span class="cl">(Reish Lakish):</span> He holds that it was Ra'uy after slaughter, for if a nicer one was found, we would have redeemed the first one. (This contradicts the Beraisa!)</p>
<p class="bas indent1"><span class="nm">(j)</span><span class="cl">Answer #2 (Rabah):</span> Rather, even though it is uncommon to find a nicer red heifer, Hekdesh stipulates about this because red heifers are very expensive.</p>
<p class="bas indent1"><span class="nm">(k)</span><span class="cl">(Beraisa):</span> If a red heifer died (without slaughter), it is redeemed.</p>
<p class="bas indent1"><span class="nm">(l)</span><span class="cl">Question:</span> We do not redeem Kodshim to feed them to dogs!</p>
<p class="bas indent1"><span class="nm">(m)</span><span class="cl">Answer (Rav Mesharshiya):</span> It is redeemed for its skin.</p>
<p class="bas indent1"><span class="nm">(n)</span><span class="cl">Question:</span> Does Hekdesh make the Kedushah conditional just so if it dies, we can redeem it for the skin?!</p>
<p class="bas indent1"><span class="nm">(o)</span><span class="cl">Answer (Rav Kahana):</span> Even the ear of an (expensive animal such as a) camel is worthwhile.</p>
<p class="bas indent1"><span class="nm">(p)</span><span class="cl">Question (Mishnah - Rabanan):</span> If a goat designated for one of these three atonements was lost, and it was found after a substitute was offered, may the found goat be used for another of the three atonements?</p>
<p class="bas indent2"><span class="nm">1.</span><span class="cl">R. Shimon:</span> Yes.</p>
<p class="bas indent2"><span class="nm">2.</span><span class="cl">Rabanan:</span> If it was originally designated for one atonement, how can it atone for something else?!</p>
<p class="bas indent2"><span class="nm">3.</span><span class="cl">R. Shimon:</span> They all atone for Tum'ah in the Mikdash or with Kodshim. This is essentially what it was designated for!</p>
<p class="bas indent2"><span class="nm">4.</span><span class="cl">Summation of question:</span> Why didn't R. Shimon answer that Hekdesh buys things for the Avodah on condition?</p>
<p class="bas indent1"><span class="nm">(q)</span><span class="cl">Answer:</span> R. Shimon holds that Hekdesh does not buy things on condition.</p>
<p class="bas indent2"><span class="nm">1.</span><span class="cl">(Rav Idi bar Avin):</span> R. Shimon forbids redeeming Tam lambs for the Tamid that were not used by Nisan. Chachamim permit this.</p>
<p class="bas indent1"><span class="nm">(r)</span><span class="cl">Question:</span> Who are the Chachamim who argue with R. Shimon (and say that Hekdesh purchases on condition)?</p>
