<p class="bas subject"><span class="nm">1)</span>POSTPONED ACQUISITIONS</p>
<p class="bas indent1"><span class="nm">(a)</span><span class="cl">(R. Avin and Rav Yitzchak b'Rebbi):</span> According to Bar Pada we can resolve R. Hoshaya's question:</p>
<p class="bas indent2"><span class="nm">1.</span><span class="cl">Question (R. Hoshaya):</span> If a man gave two Perutos to a woman and told her 'one Perutah is Mekadesh you to me today. The other is Mekadesh you to me after I divorce you' (what is the law)?</p>
<p class="bas indent2"><span class="nm">2.</span>According to Bar Pada, also the second Kidushin takes effect!</p>
<p class="bas indent1"><span class="nm">(b)</span><span class="cl">Objection (R. Yirmiyah):</span> You cannot equate the case when the one who created the Kedushah redeems it to a case where someone else redeems it!</p>
<p class="bas indent2"><span class="nm">1.</span><span class="cl">(R. Yochanan):</span> If the one who made them Hekdesh redeems them, they become Hekdesh again. If someone else redeems them, they do not.</p>
<p class="bas indent2"><span class="nm">2.</span>Kidushin is like redemption by someone else. (After divorce, he cannot force her to accept Kidushin.)</p>
<p class="bas subject"><span class="nm">2)</span>WHO IS A SEAFARER?</p>
<p class="bas indent1"><span class="nm">(a)</span><span class="cl">(Mishnah):</span> If one is Mudar Hana'ah (vowed not to benefit) from seafarers, he may benefit from those who dwell on land. If one is Mudar Hana'ah from those who dwell on land, he may not may not benefit from seafarers, since seafarers are also considered to dwell on land.</p>
<p class="bas indent2"><span class="nm">1.</span>This does not refer to those who go from Ako to Yafo, rather, to those who take extended voyages.</p>
<p class="bas indent1"><span class="nm">(b)</span><span class="cl">(Gemara - Rav Papa or Rav Acha brei d'Rav Ika):</span> The last clause (this does not refer,,, rather, to those who take extended voyages) applies to the first law;</p>
<p class="bas indent1"><span class="nm">(c)</span><span class="cl">(The other of Rav Papa Rav Acha brei d'Rav Ika):</span> It applies to the Seifa (a vowed from land dwellers).</p>
<p class="bas indent1"><span class="nm">(d)</span>The one who applies it to the Reisha explains as follows:</p>
<p class="bas indent2"><span class="nm">1.</span>If one is Mudar Hana'ah from seafarers, he is permitted to benefit from land dwellers. We infer that he may not benefit from seafarers;</p>
<p class="bas bbbline">30b----------------------------------------30b</p>
<p class="bas indent2"><span class="nm">2.</span>The seafarers referred to are not those who go from Ako to Yafo. Those are considered land dwellers. Rather, it refers to those who take extended voyages.</p>
<p class="bas indent1"><span class="nm">(e)</span>The opinion that it applies to the Seifa explains as follows:</p>
<p class="bas indent2"><span class="nm">1.</span>If one is Mudar Hana'ah from those who dwell on land, he may not  benefit from seafarers;</p>
<p class="bas indent2"><span class="nm">2.</span>This does not refer to those who go from Ako to Yafo, rather, to those who take extended voyages, for also they eventually come to land.</p>
<p class="bas subject"><span class="nm">3)</span>WHO IS INCLUDED IN VOWS</p>
<p class="bas indent1"><span class="nm">(a)</span><span class="cl">(Mishnah):</span> If one vowed from 'Ro'ei ha'Chamah' (seers of the sun), he may not benefit even from blind people. He meant, those seen by the sun.</p>
<p class="bas indent1"><span class="nm">(b)</span><span class="cl">(Gemara):</span> We infer this from the fact that he did not say 'those who see.' He excluded fish and embryos from his vow.</p>
<p class="bas indent1"><span class="nm">(c)</span><span class="cl">(Mishnah):</span> If one vowed from black-headed people, he may not benefit from bald people or white-haired people, but he may benefit from women and children. Only men are called black-headed.</p>
<p class="bas indent1"><span class="nm">(d)</span><span class="cl">(Gemara):</span> (He may not benefit from bald or white-haired people.) This is because he did not say 'those with hair'.</p>
<p class="bas indent1"><span class="nm">(e)</span><span class="cl">(Mishnah):</span> He may benefit from women and children. Only men are called black-headed.</p>
<p class="bas indent1"><span class="nm">(f)</span><span class="cl">Question:</span> Why is this?</p>
<p class="bas indent1"><span class="nm">(g)</span><span class="cl">Answer:</span> Men sometimes cover their heads, sometimes not. Women's heads are always covered, and children's are always uncovered. (One calls them 'people with covered (or exposed) heads.)</p>
<p class="bas indent1"><span class="nm">(h)</span><span class="cl">(Mishnah):</span> If one vowed from Yeludim (those already born), he may benefit from Noladim (those who will be born). If one vowed from Noladim, he may not benefit from Yeludim;</p>
<p class="bas indent1"><span class="nm">(i)</span>R. Meir permits even from Yeludim;</p>
<p class="bas indent1"><span class="nm">(j)</span>Chachamim say that he refers to those who enter the world through birth.</p>
<p class="bas indent1"><span class="nm">(k)</span><span class="cl">(Gemara) Question:</span> R. Meir permits (even Yeludim, and obviously Noladim. From whom did he vow?</p>
<p class="bas indent1"><span class="nm">(l)</span><span class="cl">Answer:</span> The Mishnah is abbreviated. The full version is 'If one vowed from Yeludim, he may benefit from Noladim. If one vowed from Noladim, he' may not benefit from Yeludim;</p>
<p class="bas indent2"><span class="nm">1.</span>R. Meir says, even if one vowed from Noladim, he may benefit from Yeludim, just like one who vowed from Yeludim may benefit from Noladim.</p>
<p class="bas indent1"><span class="nm">(m)</span><span class="cl">Question (Rav Papa):</span> This implies that Noladim means those who will be born. Can we say that "Your two sons ha'Noladim' to you in Mitzrayim" refers to sons who will be born?!</p>
<p class="bas indent2"><span class="nm">1.</span><span class="cl">Counter-question (Abaye):</span> You hold that it means those who were born. It says "A son Nolad to the house of David, Yoshiyahu"!</p>
<p class="bas indent2"><span class="nm">2.</span>It cannot mean 'was born.' Even Menasheh (from whom  Yoshiyahu descends) was not yet born at that time!</p>
<p class="bas indent1"><span class="nm">(n)</span><span class="cl">Answer (to both questions - Abaye):</span> Rather, Nolad (in the Torah) has both meanings. Regarding vows, we follow the way people speak.</p>
<p class="bas indent1"><span class="nm">(o)</span><span class="cl">(Mishnah):</span> Chachamim say that his intention was to those who enter the world via birth.</p>
<p class="bas indent2"><span class="nm">1.</span>This excludes fish and birds (they hatch from eggs).</p>
