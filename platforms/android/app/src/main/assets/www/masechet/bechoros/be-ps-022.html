<p class="bas indent1"><span class="nm">(a)</span><span class="cl">Question:</span> Why must the cake be buried?</p>
<p class="bas indent1"><span class="nm">(b)</span><span class="cl">Answer:</span> This is to publicize that the mother is exempt from Bechorah.</p>
<p class="bas indent1"><span class="nm">(c)</span><span class="cl">Inference:</span> The cake is a proper child.</p>
<p class="bas indent1"><span class="nm">(d)</span><span class="cl">Question:</span> Why isn't the cake Metamei?</p>
<p class="bas indent1"><span class="nm">(e)</span><span class="cl">Answer (R. Yochanan):</span> The (dissolved) fetus is Batel in a majority of blood.</p>
<p class="bas indent1"><span class="nm">(f)</span>This is like he taught elsewhere;</p>
<p class="bas indent2"><span class="nm">1.</span><span class="cl">(R. Yochanan):</span> R. Eliezer ben Yakov (in our Mishnah) and R. Shimon taught the same thing.</p>
<p class="bas indent2"><span class="nm">2.</span><span class="cl">(Mishnah):</span> If a Shilya is in a house, the house is Tamei;</p>
<p class="bas indent3"><span class="nm">i.</span>A Shilya is not considered a (dead) child (to be Metamei). Rather, it is always accompanied by a child.</p>
<p class="bas indent3"><span class="nm">ii.</span>R. Shimon says, perhaps the child was dissolved before the Shilya left the mother (the house is Tahor).</p>
<p class="bas subject"><span class="nm">2)</span>PESICHAS HA'KEVER</p>
<p class="bas indent1"><span class="nm">(a)</span><span class="cl">(Mishnah):</span> Pesichas ha'Kever (once a woman begins to give birth to a Nefel, it is Metamei the house as if it were already born) applies only if the head was at least as big as a Pikah (lump).</p>
<p class="bas indent1"><span class="nm">(b)</span><span class="cl">Question:</span> What Pikah does this refer to?</p>
<p class="bas indent1"><span class="nm">(c)</span><span class="cl">Answer (Rav Huna):</span> It is the ball at the end of knitting needle for woolen thread.</p>
<p class="bas indent1"><span class="nm">(d)</span><span class="cl">Question (Chiya bar Rav):</span> Do you refer to (a needle for) warp threads, or (for) woof threads? (The latter is larger.)</p>
<p class="bas indent1"><span class="nm">(e)</span><span class="cl">Answer (Rav Huna - Beraisa - R. Meir):</span> The head must be like the Pikah of a warp needle;</p>
<p class="bas indent2"><span class="nm">1.</span>R. Yehudah requires the size of a Pikah for woof;</p>
<p class="bas indent2"><span class="nm">2.</span>R. Eliezer b'Rebbi Tzadok says, Pesichas ha'Kever applies (regarding of the head size), if Tefifiyos are seen in the womb.</p>
<p class="bas indent2"><span class="nm">3.</span><span class="cl">Question:</span> What are Tefifiyos?</p>
<p class="bas indent2"><span class="nm">4.</span><span class="cl">Answer (Shmuel citing R. Eliezer b'Rebbi Tzadok):</span> It is a crease twice the size of a Pikah, like when a mule bends to urinate.</p>
<p class="bas indent1"><span class="nm">(f)</span><span class="cl">(Rav Huna):</span> I heard that two laws depend on a Pikah, one of warp and one of woof. I cannot explain this.</p>
<p class="bas indent1"><span class="nm">(g)</span><span class="cl">(Rav Dimi citing R. Yochanan):</span> I heard that three laws depend on a Pikah. One is of warp, one is of woof, and one is of a large Pikah of sackmakers. I cannot explain this.</p>
<p class="bas indent1"><span class="nm">(h)</span><span class="cl">(Ravin citing R. Yochanan):</span> Pesichas ha'Kever applies if the head is as big as a warp Pikah;</p>
<p class="bas indent2"><span class="nm">1.</span>A Pikah of woof is the Shi'ur for Pesichas ha'Kever of animals. (A Nefel inside an animal is Balu'ah (swallowed). It is not Metamei (b'Maga u'Masa) until Pesichas ha'Kever.)</p>
<p class="bas indent2"><span class="nm">2.</span>The last Shi'ur applies to the following Mishnah;</p>
<p class="bas indent3"><span class="nm">i.</span><span class="cl">(Mishnah):</span> If a clod of earth from a Beis ha'Pras (a field in which a corpse was plowed. We are concerned lest the plow dragged bones) or from Chutz la'Aretz is the size of a large Pikah of sackmakers, it is Metamei b'Ohel.</p>
<p class="bas indent3"><span class="nm">ii.</span>This is the same size as the seal of large sacks, and on the top cover of barrels of Beis Lechem.</p>
<p class="bas subject"><span class="nm">3)</span>CAN TUM'AH BE REVIVED AFTER <i>BITUL</i>?</p>
<p class="bas indent1"><span class="nm">(a)</span><span class="cl">(Reish Lakish):</span> If one buys brine from an Am ha'Aretz (who is not trustworthy about Taharah), he may do Hashakah (connect it to a Mikveh). This is Metaher it, in any case:</p>
<p class="bas indent2"><span class="nm">1.</span>If the majority (Tosfos -- or even half) is water, Hashakah is Metaher water;</p>
<p class="bas indent2"><span class="nm">2.</span>If the majority is brine, brine is not Mekabel Tum'ah, and the water is Batel in the majority.</p>
<p class="bas indent1"><span class="nm">(b)</span><span class="cl">(R. Yirmeyah):</span> This is Metaher the brine to use it for a dip (i.e. water will not be added);</p>
<p class="bas indent2"><span class="nm">1.</span>If he will (add water, e.g.) cook it in a pot, and altogether there will be more water than brine, this arouses the Tum'ah. (Rashi -- it is Metamei the brine; Tosfos -- (only) the water returns to its Tum'ah.)</p>
<p class="bas indent1"><span class="nm">(c)</span><span class="cl">Question (Abaye):</span> After Tum'ah was Batel, does it really return?!</p>
<p class="bas indent1"><span class="nm">(d)</span><span class="cl">Answer (Rav Dimi):</span> Surely, you agree that it does!</p>
<p class="bas indent2"><span class="nm">1.</span><span class="cl">(Mishnah - R. Eliezer):</span> If a Se'ah of Tamei Terumah fell into 100 Sa'im of Chulin, we take one Se'ah from the mixture and let it rot;</p>
<p class="bas bbbline">22b----------------------------------------22b</p>
<p class="bas indent3"><span class="nm">i.</span>(Mid'Oraisa, the Terumah was Batel. Chachamim require removing a Se'ah.) We consider the Se'ah removed to be the one that fell in.</p>
<p class="bas indent2"><span class="nm">2.</span>Chachamim say, the Se'ah removed (is given to a Kohen. It and the mixture) may be eaten in any of the following ways (so it cannot become Tamei):</p>
<p class="bas indent3"><span class="nm">i.</span>Dry (so it is not Huchshar to be Mekabel Tum'ah), parched, kneaded with fruit juice (which is not Machshir), or divided into small doughs, each less than the size of an egg. (Rishonim argue about whether an egg is the Shi'ur for Hechsher, or for a Tamei food to be Metamei food, or to be Mekabel Tum'as Ochlin mid'Oraisa.)</p>
<p class="bas indent2"><span class="nm">3.</span><span class="cl">(Beraisa):</span> According to R. Eliezer, the Chulin (the remainder after removing a Se'ah) may be eaten dry, parched, kneaded with fruit juice, or divided into small doughs.</p>
<p class="bas indent2"><span class="nm">4.</span><span class="cl">Question (Ula):</span> (Chachamim consider everything to be (Tahor) Chulin, through Bitul, and R. Eliezer considers the remainder to be Chulin.) Why must it be eaten dry (or parched, etc.)?</p>
<p class="bas indent2"><span class="nm">5.</span><span class="cl">Answer (Ula):</span> This is a decree, lest one join this Chulin to a slightly smaller volume of Tamei food to be Mevatel it (thinking that the Tum'ah will be the minority);</p>
<p class="bas indent3"><span class="nm">i.</span>Really, since some of this Chulin is Tamei, it joins with the Tamei food, and the Tum'ah is aroused.</p>
