<div class="subject"><span class="nm">1)</span><p>CAN A MINOR GIVE BIRTH (cont.)?</p></div>
<div class="indent1"><span class="nm">(a)</span><p><span class="cl">Answer #3 (Rav Zvid):</span> She cannot have children without bringing Simanim (and they are valid signs of adulthood even if she is less than 12).</p></div>
<div class="indent1"><span class="nm">(b)</span><p><span class="cl">Question:</span> We can check if she brought! (Why must we rely on a Chazakah?)</p></div>
<div class="indent1"><span class="nm">(c)</span><p><span class="cl">Answer:</span> We are concerned lest they fell out.</p></div>
<div class="indent1"><span class="nm">(d)</span><p><span class="cl">Question:</span> This is like the opinion that is concerned lest Simanim fell out. How can we answer for the opinion that is not concerned?</p></div>
<div class="indent1"><span class="nm">(e)</span><p><span class="cl">Answer:</span> Here even he is concerned lest they fell out due to the pain of childbirth.</p></div>
<div class="subject"><span class="nm">2)</span><p>THE EXEMPTION OF THE TZARAH</p></div>
<div class="indent1"><span class="nm">(a)</span><p><span class="cl">(Mishnah):</span> The Arayos exempt their Tzaros (and the Tzaros of their Tzaros).</p></div>
<div class="indent1"><span class="nm">(b)</span><p><span class="cl">Question:</span> What is the source of this?</p></div>
<div class="indent1"><span class="nm">(c)</span><p><span class="cl">Answer #1 (Rav Yehudah):</span> "Litzror (to be a co-wife)" - the extra 'Reish' suggests many Tzaros.</p></div>
<div class="indent1"><span class="nm">(d)</span><p><span class="cl">Answer #2 (Rav Ashi):</span> It is logical. A Tzarah is forbidden because she falls to Yibum with an Ervah. The Tzarah of a Tzarah also falls to Yibum with an Ervah (Tzaras Ervah is Eshes Ach without a Heter)!</p></div>
<div class="indent1"><span class="nm">(e)</span><p><span class="cl">(Mishnah):</span> If the Ervah... was divorced... the Tzaros are permitted.</p></div>
<div class="indent1"><span class="nm">(f)</span><p>This applies even if the deceased married the Tzarah before he divorced the Ervah.</p></div>
<div class="indent1"><span class="nm">(g)</span><p><span class="cl">Contradiction (Mishnah):</span> Reuven, Shimon and Levi (brothers) are married to Rachel and Leah (sisters) and Esther (an unrelated woman), respectively. Reuven divorced Rachel, then Levi died. Reuven did Yibum, then died. In this case, we say that if the Ervah... was divorced, the Tzaros are permitted.</p></div>
<div class="indent2"><span class="nm">1.</span><p>We only say this because he divorced before doing Yibum, but if not, not!</p></div>
<div class="indent1"><span class="nm">(h)</span><p><span class="cl">Answer #1 (R. Yirmeyah):</span> We must say that different Tana'im taught these Mishnayos.</p></div>
<div class="indent2"><span class="nm">1.</span><p>The Tana of our Mishnah holds that the widows fall to Yibum at the time of death. The Tana of the other Mishnah considers the fall to begin from when they married.</p></div>
<div class="indent1"><span class="nm">(i)</span><p><span class="cl">Answer #2 (Rava):</span> One Tana taught both Mishnayos. Mishnah #2 teaches something which follows from our Mishnah (all the more so if he divorced before doing Yibum, the Tzaros are permitted)!</p></div>
<div class="indent1"><span class="nm">(j)</span><p><span class="cl">(Mishnah):</span> Anyone who could have done Mi'un...</p></div>
<div class="indent1"><span class="nm">(k)</span><p><span class="cl">Question:</span> Let her do Mi'un now, and then her Tzarah may do Yibum!</p></div>
<div class="indent1"><span class="nm">(l)</span><p><span class="cl">Suggestion:</span> She cannot because of R. Oshaya's law (our Mishnah supports him):</p></div>
<div class="indent2"><span class="nm">1.</span><p><span class="cl">(R. Oshaya):</span> A girl can do Mi'un to undo a Ma'amar, but not to undo a fall to Yibum.</p></div>
<div class="indent1"><span class="nm">(m)</span><p><span class="cl">Rejection:</span> Perhaps Mi'un can undo a fall to Yibum, but the case of Tzaras Ervah is different, like Rami bar Yechezkel taught:</p></div>
<div class="indent2"><span class="nm">1.</span><p><span class="cl">(Rami bar Yechezkel):</span> If a girl did Mi'un to her husband, she may marry his father. If she did Mi'un to the Yavam, she is forbidden to the father.</p></div>
<div class="indent3"><span class="nm">i.</span><p>This is because when she fell to Yibum, she looked like his daughter-in-law.</p></div>
<div class="indent2"><span class="nm">2.</span><p>Also here, when the fell to Yibum (before Mi'un), she looked like Tzaras Ervah.</p></div>
<div class="subject"><span class="nm">3)</span><p>THE MORE STRINGENT ARAYOS</p></div>
<div class="indent1"><span class="nm">(a)</span><p><span class="cl">(Mishnah):</span> Six Arayos are more stringent than the 15 (Daf 2A). Since these six can marry others (but not brothers of the Yavam), their 'Tzaros' are permitted (they are not really Tzaros, for the Ervah is not truly married):</p></div>
<div class="indent2"><span class="nm">1.</span><p>The Yavam's mother;</p></div>
<div class="indent2"><span class="nm">2.</span><p>His father's wife;</p></div>
<div class="indent2"><span class="nm">3.</span><p>His father's sister;</p></div>
<div class="indent2"><span class="nm">4.</span><p>His paternal sister;</p></div>
<div class="indent2"><span class="nm">5.</span><p>The wife of his father's brother;</p></div>
<div class="indent2"><span class="nm">6.</span><p>The wife of his paternal brother.</p></div>
<div class="indent1"><span class="nm">(b)</span><p>Beis Shamai permit a Tzarah (of Ervah) to the brothers;</p></div>
<div class="indent1"><span class="nm">(c)</span><p>Beis Hillel forbid.</p></div>
<div class="bbbline">13b----------------------------------------13b</p></div>
<div class="indent1"><span class="nm">(d)</span><p>If a Tzarah did Chalitzah, Beis Shamai disqualify her from Kehunah (marrying a Kohen);</p></div>
<div class="indent1"><span class="nm">(e)</span><p>Beis Hillel permit.</p></div>
<div class="indent1"><span class="nm">(f)</span><p>If she did Yibum, Beis Shamai permit her to Kehunah (if later she was widowed);</p></div>
<div class="indent1"><span class="nm">(g)</span><p>Beis Hillel forbid.</p></div>
<div class="indent1"><span class="nm">(h)</span><p>Even though Beis Shamai and Beis Hillel argued, they would not refrain from marrying women of the opposing school.</p></div>
<div class="indent1"><span class="nm">(i)</span><p>Even though in many laws of Taharah, one school is Metaher and the other is Metamei, each school trusted the Taharah of Kelim of the other school.</p></div>
<div class="subject"><span class="nm">4)</span><p>THE SOURCE FOR BEIS SHAMAI</p></div>
<div class="indent1"><span class="nm">(a)</span><p><span class="cl">(Gemara - R. Shimon ben Pazi):</span> Beis Shamai learns from "Lo Sihyeh Eshes ha'Mes <i>ha'Chutzah</i> l'Ish Zar". This implies that there are <i>insiders</i> (relatives of the Yavam), and the Torah said that she (the outsider, i.e. Tzaras Ervah) may not marry someone else. (Rather, she does Yibum);</p></div>
<div class="indent1"><span class="nm">(b)</span><p>Beis Hillel expound the verse as Rav Yehudah does:</p></div>
<div class="indent2"><span class="nm">1.</span><p><span class="cl">(Rav Yehudah):</span> If a stranger was Mekadesh a Yevamah, it does not take effect. "<i>Lo Sihyeh</i>..." - she cannot have Havayah (Kidushin) to a stranger. (Havayah and Sihyeh come from the same root.)</p></div>
<div class="indent1"><span class="nm">(c)</span><p>Beis Shamai disagree, for it says "ha'Chutzah". It does not say 'la'Chutz (to a stranger)'!</p></div>
<div class="indent1"><span class="nm">(d)</span><p>Beis Hillel say that since there is a 'Hei' at the end of the word, it is as if it says 'la'Chutz':</p></div>
<div class="indent2"><span class="nm">1.</span><p><span class="cl">(Beraisa - R. Nechemyah):</span> The Torah (sometimes) puts a 'Hei' at the end of a word that should have the prefix 'Lamed' (to mean 'to').</p></div>
<div class="indent2"><span class="nm">2.</span><p><span class="cl">(Tana d'Vei R. Yishmael):</span> Some examples are "Mitzraimah", "Midbarah"...</p></div>
<div class="indent1"><span class="nm">(e)</span><p>Beis Shamai learn Rav Yehudah's law from "l'Ish Zar".</p></div>
<div class="indent1"><span class="nm">(f)</span><p><span class="cl">Question:</span> Why don't Beis Hillel also learn from there?</p></div>
<div class="indent1"><span class="nm">(g)</span><p><span class="cl">Retraction:</span> They actually do.</p></div>
<div class="indent1"><span class="nm">(h)</span><p><span class="cl">Question:</span> If so, what do they learn from "ha'Chutzah"?</p></div>
<div class="indent1"><span class="nm">(i)</span><p><span class="cl">Answer:</span> This includes a widow who was only Mekudeshes.</p></div>
<div class="indent2"><span class="nm">1.</span><p>Beis Shamai learns this from the extra 'Hei' at the end of  "Chutz".</p></div>
<div class="indent2"><span class="nm">2.</span><p>Beis Hillel do not expound the 'Hei', for they do not consider it to be extra.</p></div>
<div class="indent1"><span class="nm">(j)</span><p><span class="cl">(Rava):</span> The reason for Beis Shamai is Ein Isur Chal Al Isur (an Isur does not take effect on something already forbidden).</p></div>
<div class="indent1"><span class="nm">(k)</span><p>We understand this if Reuven married Rachel before his brother Shimon married her sister Leah (and Reuven died);</p></div>
<div class="indent2"><span class="nm">1.</span><p>Rachel does not become forbidden to Shimon due to Achos Ishto (his wife's sister), since she was already forbidden (Eshes Ach, his brother's wife. Therefore, Rachel's Tzarah is not considered Tzaras Ervah.)</p></div>
<div class="indent1"><span class="nm">(l)</span><p><span class="cl">Question:</span> However, if Shimon married Leah before Reuven married Rachel, Achos Ishto took effect on Rachel (her Tzarah should be considered Tzaras Ervah)!</p></div>
<div class="indent1"><span class="nm">(m)</span><p><span class="cl">Answer:</span> Since the Isur of Eshes Ach did not take effect on her (since she was already forbidden), we do not consider her Tzarah to be Tzaras Ervah in the situation of Yibum, therefore her Tzarah is permitted.</p></div>
<div class="indent1"><span class="nm">(n)</span><p><span class="cl">(Mishnah):</span> If a Tzarah did Chalitzah...</p></div>
<div class="indent1"><span class="nm">(o)</span><p><span class="cl">Question:</span> Why does the Mishnah need to teach that Beis Hillel permit her to Kehunah? They say that there was no need for Chalitzah!</p></div>
<div class="indent1"><span class="nm">(p)</span><p><span class="cl">Answer:</span> The Mishnah teaches unlike R. Yochanan ben Nuri, who suggested enacting that in every case of Tzaras Ervah, Chalitzah should be done (so that all marriages will be valid according to both schools. R. Yochanan ben Nuri would disqualify from Kehunah, since he holds that Chalitzah was necessary, mid'Rabanan.)</p></div>
<div class="indent1"><span class="nm">(q)</span><p><span class="cl">(Mishnah):</span> If she did Yibum, Beis Hillel disqualify her from Kehunah.</p></div>
<div class="indent1"><span class="nm">(r)</span><p><span class="cl">Question:</span> Why is this needed?</p></div>
<div class="indent1"><span class="nm">(s)</span><p><span class="cl">Answer:</span> Since we taught the law regarding Chalitzah, we also teach regarding Yibum.</p></div>
<div class="subject"><span class="nm">5)</span><p>FACTIONS WITHIN YISRAEL</p></div>
<div class="indent1"><span class="nm">(a)</span><p><span class="cl">(Mishnah):</span> The Megilah is read on the 11th, 12th, 13th, 14th, and 15th.</p></div>
<div class="indent1"><span class="nm">(b)</span><p><span class="cl">Question (Reish Lakish):</span> This transgresses "Lo Sisgodedu" - do not have differing factions!</p></div>
<div class="indent2"><span class="nm">1.</span><p><span class="cl">Question:</span> "Lo Sisgodedu" forbids wounding oneself in grief over a deceased!</p></div>
<div class="indent2"><span class="nm">2.</span><p><span class="cl">Answer:</span> "Lo Segodedu" would have taught that. The Torah wrote "Lo Sisgodedu" to forbid factions.</p></div>
<div class="indent2"><span class="nm">3.</span><p><span class="cl">Question:</span> Perhaps it comes only to teach this!</p></div>
<div class="indent2"><span class="nm">4.</span><p><span class="cl">Answer:</span> If so, it should have said 'Lo Sagodu'. Since it says "Lo Sisgodedu", we learn both.</p></div>
<div class="indent1"><span class="nm">(c)</span><p><span class="cl">Counter-question: (R. Yochanan):</span> Why didn't you ask from a prior Mishnah?</p></div>
<div class="indent2"><span class="nm">1.</span><p><span class="cl">(Mishnah):</span> Where the custom is do work on Erev Pesach, we work until noon. Where the custom is not to work, we do not work.</p></div>
<div class="indent1"><span class="nm">(d)</span><p><span class="cl">Answer #1 (Reish Lakish):</span> I asked regarding an Isur. Why do you suggest I should ask regarding a custom?</p></div>
<div class="indent2"><span class="nm">1.</span><p><span class="cl">(Rav Shemen bar Aba):</span> "To fulfill... in their times" - Chachamim enacted many times (to read Megilas Esther).</p></div>
<div class="indent1"><span class="nm">(e)</span><p><span class="cl">Objection:</span> Also working on Erev Pesach is an Isur!</p></div>
<div class="indent2"><span class="nm">1.</span><p><span class="cl">(Mishnah):</span> Beis Shamai forbid working the previous night;</p></div>
<div class="indent2"><span class="nm">2.</span><p>Beis Hillel permit.</p></div>
<div class="indent1"><span class="nm">(f)</span><p><span class="cl">Answer #2 (Reish Lakish):</span> If one does not work, it looks like he has no work to do (so it is not a problem of factions).</p></div>
