<p class="bas indent1"><span class="nm">(a)</span><span class="cl">(Mishnah):</span> There are laws of Korbanos Yachid that do not apply to Korbanos Tzibur, and vice-versa;</p>
<p class="bas indent2"><span class="nm">1.</span>Korbanos Yachid make Temurah. Korbanos Tzibur do not;</p>
<p class="bas indent2"><span class="nm">2.</span>Korbanos Yachid are brought from males and females. Korbanos Tzibur are only males;</p>
<p class="bas indent2"><span class="nm">3.</span>One has Acharayus for (some) Korbanos Yachid and their Nesachim (to bring them later if they were not brought in the right time). There is no Acharayus for Korbanos or Nesachim of the Tzibur;</p>
<p class="bas indent3"><span class="nm">i.</span>However, if a Korban Tzibur was brought without Nesachim, there is Acharayus for the Nesachim.</p>
<p class="bas indent1"><span class="nm">(b)</span>There are laws of Korbanos Tzibur that do not apply to Korbanos Yachid;</p>
<p class="bas indent2"><span class="nm">1.</span>Korbanos Tzibur override (may be brought on) Shabbos and Tum'ah (if they cannot be brought b'Taharah, they are brought b'Tum'ah). Korbanos Yachid do not;</p>
<p class="bas indent1"><span class="nm">(c)</span><span class="cl">R. Meir:</span> Chavitei Kohen Gadol (the Minchah he brings every day) and the Par (of the Kohen Gadol) of Yom Kipur are Korbanos Yachid, yet they override Shabbos and Tum'ah!</p>
<p class="bas indent2"><span class="nm">1.</span>Rather, Korbanos with a fixed time override Shabbos and Tum'ah.</p>
<p class="bas indent1"><span class="nm">(d)</span><span class="cl">(Gemara - Mishnah):</span> Korbanos Yachid make Temurah...</p>
<p class="bas indent1"><span class="nm">(e)</span><span class="cl">Questions:</span> This is not always true!</p>
<p class="bas indent1"><span class="nm">(f)</span><span class="cl">Question #1:</span> Some Korbanos Yachid are brought from birds. They do not make Temurah!</p>
<p class="bas indent1"><span class="nm">(g)</span><span class="cl">Answer:</span> Korbanos Yachid of Behemos make Temurah.</p>
<p class="bas indent1"><span class="nm">(h)</span><span class="cl">Question #2:</span> Vlados Kodshim are a Korban Yachid (the Tzibur brings only males), yet they do not make Temurah!</p>
<p class="bas indent1"><span class="nm">(i)</span><span class="cl">Answer #1:</span> Our Mishnah is like R. Yehudah, who says that Vlados Kodshim make Temurah.</p>
<p class="bas indent1"><span class="nm">(j)</span><span class="cl">Question #3:</span> Temurah may be brought for a Korban Yachid. It does not make Temurah!</p>
<p class="bas indent1"><span class="nm">(k)</span><span class="cl">Answer (and Answer #2 to Question #2):</span> The Mishnah means that initial Hekdesh of Korbanos Yachid make Temurah.</p>
<p class="bas indent1"><span class="nm">(l)</span><span class="cl">(Mishnah):</span> Korbanos Yachid are brought from males and females.</p>
<p class="bas indent1"><span class="nm">(m)</span><span class="cl">Question #1:</span> Olah is a Korban Yachid. It must be male!</p>
<p class="bas indent1"><span class="nm">(n)</span><span class="cl">Answer #1:</span> Olas ha'Of can be female.</p>
<p class="bas indent1"><span class="nm">(o)</span><span class="cl">Question #2:</span> Chatas (of a commoner) is a Korban Yachid. It must be female!</p>
<p class="bas indent1"><span class="nm">(p)</span><span class="cl">Answer #1:</span> Chatas of a Nasi (the king) is a male.</p>
<p class="bas indent1"><span class="nm">(q)</span><span class="cl">Question #3:</span> Asham is a Korban Yachid. It must be male!</p>
<p class="bas indent1"><span class="nm">(r)</span><span class="cl">Answer #1:</span> The Mishnah means that any Korban Yachid that applies also to the Tzibur can be male or female.</p>
<p class="bas indent1"><span class="nm">(s)</span><span class="cl">Answer #2 (to Questions 1-3):</span> The Mishnah means that there are Korbanos Yachid that can be male or female, i.e. Shelamim.</p>
<p class="bas subject"><span class="nm">2)</span>ACHARAYUS FOR NESACHIM</p>
<p class="bas indent1"><span class="nm">(a)</span><span class="cl">(Mishnah):</span> One has Acharayus for Korbanos Yachid and their Nesachim... (there is no Acharayus for Korbanos or Nesachim of the Tzibur).</p>
<p class="bas indent1"><span class="nm">(b)</span><span class="cl">Question:</span> What is the source of this?</p>
<p class="bas indent1"><span class="nm">(c)</span><span class="cl">Answer (Beraisa #1):</span> "Devar Yom b'Yomo" teaches that Musaf may be offered the entire day;</p>
<p class="bas indent2"><span class="nm">1.</span>"B'Yomo" teaches that if it was not brought on the day, there is no Acharayus (to bring it later).</p>
<p class="bas indent1"><span class="nm">(d)</span><span class="cl">Suggestion:</span> Perhaps there is no Acharayus for Nesachim (that should accompany Musafim) even if the Korban was brought!</p>
<p class="bas indent1"><span class="nm">(e)</span><span class="cl">Rejection #1:</span> "Minchasam v'Niskeihem" teaches that they may be brought at night, or the next day.</p>
<p class="bas indent1"><span class="nm">(f)</span><span class="cl">Rejection #2 (Reish Lakish):</span> "Milvad Shabsos Hash-m" (teaches that if Nesachim of Shabbos were not brought on Shabbos, they may be brought on a later day, even on Yom Tov).</p>
<p class="bas indent1"><span class="nm">(g)</span>The Torah needed to write both of these;</p>
<p class="bas indent2"><span class="nm">1.</span>Had it written only "Milvad Shabsos Hash-m", we would know only that Nesachim may be brought on a later day, we would not know that they may be brought at night;</p>
<p class="bas indent2"><span class="nm">2.</span>Had it written only "Minchasam v'Niskeihem", we would know only that Nesachim may be brought the following night. We would not know that they may be brought on a later day.</p>
<p class="bas indent2"><span class="nm">3.</span><span class="cl">Question:</span> Why would we think so?</p>
<p class="bas indent2"><span class="nm">4.</span><span class="cl">Answer:</span> Regarding Kodshim, the night is (usually) considered the completion of the previous day.</p>
<p class="bas indent1"><span class="nm">(h)</span><span class="cl">Question:</span> Nesachim may not be brought at night!</p>
<p class="bas indent2"><span class="nm">1.</span><span class="cl">(Beraisa #2):</span> ("Hi ha'Olah... Kol ha'Lailah") teaches that things that may be offered at night, such as limbs and Chelev, may be put on the Mizbe'ach after sunset and left to burn all night;</p>
<p class="bas indent3"><span class="nm">i.</span><span class="cl">Question:</span> What is the source that things offered (only) during the day, such as Kometz (the handful taken from a Minchah), Levonah (frankincense) and Minchas Nesachim (that accompanies a Korban), may be put on the Mizbe'ach after sunset...</p>
<p class="bas indent3"><span class="nm">ii.</span><span class="cl">Interjection:</span> What is offered only during the day may not be put on the Mizbe'ach after sunset!</p>
<p class="bas indent3"><span class="nm">iii.</span><span class="cl">Correction:</span> Rather, what is the source that things offered during the day, such as Kometz, Levonah and Minchas Nesachim, may be put on the Mizbe'ach <i>just before</i> sunset and left to burn all night?</p>
<p class="bas indent3"><span class="nm">iv.</span><span class="cl">Answer:</span> "Zos Toras ha'Olah" includes them.</p>
<p class="bas indent2"><span class="nm">2.</span><span class="cl">Summation of question:</span> Beraisa #2 says that Minchas Nesachim is offered (only) during the day!</p>
<p class="bas indent1"><span class="nm">(i)</span><span class="cl">Answer #1 (Rami bar Chama):</span> Beraisa #1 teaches that one may be Mekadesh Nesachim (through putting them in a Kli) at night. Beraisa #2 says that they must be offered during the day.</p>
<p class="bas indent1"><span class="nm">(j)</span><span class="cl">Objection (Rava):</span> If Kidush may be at night, they may be offered at night!</p>
<p class="bas indent2"><span class="nm">1.</span><span class="cl">(Beraisa):</span> The general rule is, anything offered during the day, one may be Mekadesh it during the day;</p>
<p class="bas indent2"><span class="nm">2.</span>Anything offered during the night, one may be Mekadesh it at night. (Anything offered at either time, one may be Mekadesh it at either time. Rashash deletes this, for Minchas Nesachim is the only thing that may be offered at night.)</p>
<p class="bas indent1"><span class="nm">(k)</span><span class="cl">Answer #2 (Rav Yosef):</span> We must delete "Minchas Nesachim" from the text of Beraisa #2.</p>
<p class="bas indent1"><span class="nm">(l)</span>Rav Dimi went to Eretz Yisrael, and heard the following;</p>
<p class="bas indent2"><span class="nm">1.</span>(R. Yirmeyah citing R. Yehoshua ben Levi) Question: What is the source that Nesachim that come with a Korban (Rambam; R. Gershom - they were already Kodesh when it was offered; Rashi - Shechitah was Mekadesh them) must be offered during the day?</p>
<p class="bas indent2"><span class="nm">2.</span><span class="cl">Answer:</span> "Ul'Niskeichem ul'Shalmeichem" teaches that just like Shelamim must be offered during the day, also Nesachim.</p>
<p class="bas indent2"><span class="nm">3.</span><span class="cl">Rav Dimi:</span> If I knew someone going to Bavel, I would send a letter to Rav Yosef. We need not delete "Minchas Nesachim" from Beraisa #2!</p>
<p class="bas bbbline">14b----------------------------------------14b</p>
<p class="bas indent1"><span class="nm">(m)</span><span class="cl">Answer #3 (Rav Dimi):</span> Nesachim offered with a Korban must be offered during the day. Nesachim offered by themselves may be offered at night.</p>
<p class="bas subject"><span class="nm">3)</span>WRITING ORAL TORAH</p>
<p class="bas indent1"><span class="nm">(a)</span><span class="cl">Question:</span> Rav Dimi wanted to send a letter to Rav Yosef with his answer. One may not write Oral Torah!</p>
<p class="bas indent2"><span class="nm">1.</span><span class="cl">(R. Aba citing R. Yochanan):</span> One who writes Halachos is like one who burns the Torah. (One may not save it from a fire on Shabbos. Alternatively, one must destroy it);</p>
<p class="bas indent2"><span class="nm">2.</span>One who learns from written Halachos is not rewarded for this.</p>
<p class="bas indent2"><span class="nm">3.</span><span class="cl">(R. Yehudah bar Nachmani):</span> It says "Kesov Lecha Es ha'Devarim ha'Eleh", and "Ki Al Pi ha'Devarim ha'Eleh";</p>
<p class="bas indent3"><span class="nm">i.</span>This forbids learning Oral Torah that was written, and learning written Torah by heart.</p>
<p class="bas indent2"><span class="nm">4.</span><span class="cl">(Beraisa - Tana d'Vei R. Yishmael):</span> "Kesov Lecha Es ha'Devarim <i>ha'Eleh</i>" teaches that you may write Oral Torah, but not Halachos.</p>
<p class="bas indent1"><span class="nm">(b)</span><span class="cl">Version #1 (our text) Answer:</span> Perhaps one may write a new insight (e.g. Rav Dimi's answer).</p>
<p class="bas indent1"><span class="nm">(c)</span><span class="cl">Version #2 (Shitah):</span> Rabanan rely on memory. We write Oral Torah in case they will forget. (end of Version #2)</p>
<p class="bas indent1"><span class="nm">(d)</span><span class="cl">Support:</span> R. Yochanan and Reish Lakish (Shitah - when they would forget) used to look in a Sefer of Agadata (non-Halachic teachings) on Shabbos;</p>
<p class="bas indent2"><span class="nm">1.</span>They permitted this due to "Es La'asos la'Shem Heferu Torasecha." It is better to uproot a law of Torah in order that Torah will not be forgotten.</p>
<p class="bas subject"><span class="nm">4)</span>TIMES AND PLACES FOR <i>HAKRAVAH</i></p>
<p class="bas indent1"><span class="nm">(a)</span><span class="cl">(Rav Papa):</span> Since Nesachim offered by themselves may be offered at night, if Nesachim became available at night, one may be Mekadesh them and offer them at night.</p>
<p class="bas indent1"><span class="nm">(b)</span><span class="cl">Support (Rav Yosef brei d'Rav Shemayah - Beraisa):</span> The general rule is, anything offered during the day, one may be Mekadesh it during the day. Anything offered during the night, one may be Mekadesh it at night.</p>
<p class="bas indent1"><span class="nm">(c)</span><span class="cl">(Rav Ada bar Ahavah):</span> They become Pasul at dawn, like limbs of an Olah (our text; R. Gershom - they become Pasul when the limbs of the morning Tamid are offered).</p>
<p class="bas indent1"><span class="nm">(d)</span><span class="cl">(Rav Dimi):</span> "Elu Ta'asu la'Shem b'Mo'adeichem" - Chovos due to the festival (are brought during the festival);</p>
<p class="bas indent2"><span class="nm">1.</span>"Levad mi'Nidreichem v'Nidvoseichem" permits offering Nedarim and Nedavos during Chol ha'Mo'ed. (Also the following Derashos permit offering on Chol ha'Mo'ed. Many ask why a verse is needed for this, especially according to the opinion that the entire Isur Melachah on Chol ha'Mo'ed is mid'Rabanan. Shitah Mekubetzes suggests that perhaps it comes to obligate bringing them on Chol ha'Mo'ed. If not, one will transgress Bal Te'acher. Emek ha'Netziv (on Sifri) answers that one might have thought that "<i>Elu</i> Ta'asu... " teaches that <i>only</i> Temidim and Musafim may be brought on Chol ha'Mo'ed.)</p>
<p class="bas indent2"><span class="nm">2.</span><span class="cl">Question:</span> What do we learn from "l'Oloseichem"?</p>
<p class="bas indent3"><span class="nm">i.</span>It cannot teach about Olos of Nedarim or Nedavos. "Levad mi'Nidreichem v'Nidvoseichem" teaches those!</p>
<p class="bas indent2"><span class="nm">3.</span><span class="cl">Answer:</span> It refers to Olas Yoledes and Olas Metzora.</p>
<p class="bas indent2"><span class="nm">4.</span><span class="cl">Question:</span> What do we learn from "ul'Minchoseichem"?</p>
<p class="bas indent3"><span class="nm">i.</span>It cannot teach about Menachos of Nedarim or Nedavos. The verse already taught them!</p>
<p class="bas indent2"><span class="nm">5.</span><span class="cl">Answer:</span> It refers to Minchas Chotei (that a very poor person brings for a Chatas Oleh v'Yored) and Minchas Sotah.</p>
<p class="bas indent2"><span class="nm">6.</span>"Ul'Niskeichem ul'Shalmeichem" equates Nesachim to Shelamim;</p>
<p class="bas indent3"><span class="nm">i.</span>Just like Shelamim must be offered during the day, also Nesachim.</p>
<p class="bas indent2"><span class="nm">7.</span>"Ul'Shalmeichem" includes Shalmei Nazir.</p>
<p class="bas indent1"><span class="nm">(e)</span><span class="cl">Question (Abaye):</span> Shalmei Nazir is already included in Nedarim and Nedavos! Rather, we should include Shalmei Pesach (a Shelamim brought on Erev Pesach, in order that Pesach will be eaten after one is satiated from other Kodshim. It is a Chovah.)</p>
<p class="bas indent2"><span class="nm">1.</span><span class="cl">(Mishnah):</span> The general rule is, only what is brought for a Neder or Nedavah may be offered on a Bamas Yachid.</p>
<p class="bas indent2"><span class="nm">2.</span><span class="cl">(Beraisa - R. Meir):</span> Menachos and (Korbanos) Nezirus may be offered on a Bamas Yachid.</p>
<p class="bas indent1"><span class="nm">(f)</span><span class="cl">Answer:</span> We must delete "Nezirus" from the text of the Beraisa. (Tosfos - we could have answered that Tana'im argue about Rav Dimi's law. Shitah Mekubetzes brings a text that explicitly says so.)</p>
<p class="bas indent1"><span class="nm">(g)</span><span class="cl">Question:</span> Surely, all must agree that Nezirus may be offered on a Bamas Yachid!</p>
<p class="bas indent2"><span class="nm">1.</span>"Mi'Ketz Arba'im Shanah va'Yomer Avshalom... Elchah Na va'Ashalem Es Nidri Asher Nadarti la'Shem b'Chevron".</p>
<p class="bas indent2"><span class="nm">2.</span><span class="cl">Suggestion:</span> 'Nidri' refers to Korbanos Nezirus. (Avshalom said that he would offer them in Chevron, on a Bamas Yachid.)</p>
<p class="bas indent1"><span class="nm">(h)</span><span class="cl">Answer #1:</span> No, it refers to his vow to be a Nazir. (He vowed this in Chevron.)</p>
<p class="bas indent1"><span class="nm">(i)</span><span class="cl">Rejection:</span> He vowed Nezirus in Geshur!</p>
<p class="bas indent1"><span class="nm">(j)</span><span class="cl">Answer #2 (Rav Acha):</span> He went to Chevron (for that is the best place) to get lambs.</p>
<p class="bas indent2"><span class="nm">1.</span><span class="cl">Support:</span> Surely, he would not prefer to bring Korbanos in Chevron rather than in Yerushalayim!</p>
<p class="bas indent1"><span class="nm">(k)</span><span class="cl">Objection:</span> If he went just to get lambs, it should not say "<i>b</i>'Chevron", rather, "<i>me</i>'Chevron"!</p>
<p class="bas indent1"><span class="nm">(l)</span><span class="cl">Defense of suggestion:</span> Really, he went to offer them in Chevron;</p>
<p class="bas indent2"><span class="nm">1.</span><span class="cl">Question:</span> Why would he prefer to bring Korbanos in Chevron rather than in Yerushalayim?</p>
<p class="bas indent2"><span class="nm">2.</span><span class="cl">Counter-question:</span> Why do you assume that it is better to offer them in Yerushalayim, and not (on the Bamas Tzibur) in Giv'on?</p>
<p class="bas indent2"><span class="nm">3.</span><span class="cl">Answer to both questions:</span> Once Bamos Yachid were permitted, one may offer anywhere l'Chatchilah.</p>
<p class="bas indent1"><span class="nm">(m)</span><span class="cl">Question:</span> "Mi'Ketz Arba'im Shanah" - what happened 40 years before this?</p>
<p class="bas indent1"><span class="nm">(n)</span><span class="cl">Answer (Beraisa - R. Nehurai):</span> It was 40 years after Bnei Yisrael requested a king. (Shitah - the Navi teaches how quickly a rupture in the kingship arose.)</p>
<p class="bas indent2"><span class="nm">1.</span><span class="cl">(Beraisa):</span> Bnei Yisrael requested a king in the tenth year of Shmuel's reign. (He was Shofet (judge) over Yisrael);</p>
<p class="bas indent2"><span class="nm">2.</span>Shmuel reigned 10 years by himself, and one year together with Sha'ul. Sha'ul ruled two years by himself, and David ruled 37 years before Avshalom's rebellion.</p>
