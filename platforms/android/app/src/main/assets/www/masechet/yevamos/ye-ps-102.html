<p class="bas subject"><span class="nm">1)</span>FOR WHAT CAN A CONVERT BE A JUDGE?</p>
<p class="bas indent1"><span class="nm">(a)</span><span class="cl">(Rava):</span> Mid'Oraisa, a convert can judge a case between converts. It says "You will put on yourself a king ... amidst your brethren" - on you, a ruler must be amidst your brethren, but a convert can judge converts.</p>
<p class="bas indent2"><span class="nm">1.</span>If one's mother is a Yisrael, he can even judge a Yisrael;</p>
<p class="bas indent2"><span class="nm">2.</span>For Chalitzah, both parents must be from Yisrael - "His name will be called in Yisrael".</p>
<p class="bas subject"><span class="nm">2)</span>WHAT IS NEEDED FOR <i>CHALITZAH</i></p>
<p class="bas indent1"><span class="nm">(a)</span><span class="cl">(Rabah citing Rav):</span> If Eliyahu would come and say that we do Chalitzah with a Min'al (a soft leather shoe), we would heed him. If he would say that we do not do Chalitzah with a sandal, we would not heed him, because we are accustomed to using a sandal.</p>
<p class="bas indent1"><span class="nm">(b)</span><span class="cl">(Rav Yosef citing Rav):</span> If Eliyahu would say that we do not do Chalitzah with a Min'al, we would heed him. If he would say that we do not do Chalitzah with a sandal, we would not heed him, because we are accustomed to using a sandal.</p>
<p class="bas indent1"><span class="nm">(c)</span><span class="cl">Question:</span> What is the difference between these two versions?</p>
<p class="bas indent1"><span class="nm">(d)</span><span class="cl">Answer:</span> According to Rabah, we may not use a Min'al l'Chatchilah. According to Rav Yosef, we may.</p>
<p class="bas indent1"><span class="nm">(e)</span><span class="cl">Question (against Rav Yosef - Mishnah):</span> If they did Chalitzah with a Min'al, it is Kesherah,</p>
<p class="bas indent2"><span class="nm">1.</span>This connotes that it is b'Di'eved!</p>
<p class="bas indent1"><span class="nm">(f)</span><span class="cl">Answer:</span> No, it is even l'Chatchilah. Since the Seifa says that if it was done with an Anpilya (a slipper or sock) it is invalid even b'Di'eved, the Reisha also discusses b'Di'eved.</p>
<p class="bas indent1"><span class="nm">(g)</span>Tana'im argue about whether a Min'al may be used l'Chatchilah:</p>
<p class="bas indent2"><span class="nm">1.</span><span class="cl">(Beraisa - R. Yosi):</span> An elder said that he saw R. Yehudah ben Beseira oversee many Chalitzos.</p>
<p class="bas indent2"><span class="nm">2.</span><span class="cl">R. Yosi:</span> Did he use a Min'al or a sandal?</p>
<p class="bas indent2"><span class="nm">3.</span><span class="cl">The elder:</span> Is a Min'al really Kesherah? (The Torah said a shoe, not a Min'al! - some texts delete this)</p>
<p class="bas indent2"><span class="nm">4.</span><span class="cl">R. Yosi:</span> If so, why did R. Meir say that if Chalitzah was done with a Min'al, it is Kesherah?</p>
<p class="bas indent2"><span class="nm">5.</span>R. Yakov says, R. Meir permits a Min'al l'Chatchilah.</p>
<p class="bas indent1"><span class="nm">(h)</span><span class="cl">Question:</span> What is the reason for the opinion that a Min'al is only b'Di'eved?</p>
<p class="bas indent2"><span class="nm">1.</span><span class="cl">Suggestion:</span> (Chalitzah must be "me'Al (from) Raglo".) The top of a Min'al is considered me'Al his foot, and the straps (Rashi; Aruch - the leather covering) is me'Al of me'Al (from on top of)" his foot.</p>
<p class="bas indent2"><span class="nm">2.</span><span class="cl">Rejection:</span> If so, the Chalitzah should be invalid b'Di'eved!</p>
<p class="bas indent1"><span class="nm">(i)</span><span class="cl">Answer:</span> It is a decree, lest one use a torn (Rashi; Aruch - loose) Min'al, or a half-Min'al.</p>
<p class="bas indent1"><span class="nm">(j)</span><span class="cl">(Rav):</span> Had I not seen R. Chiya oversee a Chalitzah using a sandal with laces, I would have allowed only an Arab sandal, that is tight-fitting.</p>
<p class="bas indent2"><span class="nm">1.</span>Even though our sandals are tied, we tie a thin rope to make it an ideal Chalitzah.</p>
<p class="bas subject"><span class="nm">3)</span>WHAT IS CONSIDERED TAKING OFF THE SHOE?</p>
<p class="bas indent1"><span class="nm">(a)</span><span class="cl">(Rav Yehudah):</span> Once most of the heel is removed, the Yevamah is permitted.</p>
<p class="bas indent1"><span class="nm">(b)</span><span class="cl">Question (Beraisa):</span> If the straps of a Min'al or sandal were untied, or if he removed most of his foot, the Chalitzah is invalid.</p>
<p class="bas indent2"><span class="nm">1.</span><span class="cl">Inference:</span> It is invalid only because he removed the majority. Had she removed it, it would be valid!</p>
<p class="bas indent2"><span class="nm">2.</span>The majority of the foot is required, not most of the heel!</p>
<p class="bas indent1"><span class="nm">(c)</span><span class="cl">Answer:</span> 'Most of the foot' refers to most of the heel;</p>
<p class="bas indent2"><span class="nm">1.</span>The Tana calls it 'foot' because it supports the foot.</p>
<p class="bas indent1"><span class="nm">(d)</span>This supports R. Yanai;</p>
<p class="bas indent2"><span class="nm">1.</span><span class="cl">(R. Yanai):</span> Whether he untied the shoe and she removed it, or she untied the shoe and he removed it, the Chalitzah is invalid. She must untie the shoe and remove it.</p>
<p class="bas indent1"><span class="nm">(e)</span><span class="cl">Questions (R. Yanai):</span> If she tore the shoe off, what is the law? If she burned the shoe, what is the law?</p>
<p class="bas indent2"><span class="nm">1.</span>If Chalitzah require exposing the foot, this was done;</p>
<p class="bas indent2"><span class="nm">2.</span>If the shoe must be removed, this was not done.</p>
<p class="bas indent2"><span class="nm">3.</span>These questions are unresolved.</p>
<p class="bas indent1"><span class="nm">(f)</span><span class="cl">Question (R. Nechemyah):</span> If he is wearing two shoes, one on top of the other, what is the law?</p>
<p class="bas indent2"><span class="nm">1.</span><span class="cl">Question:</span> What is the case?</p>
<p class="bas indent3"><span class="nm">i.</span>If she removed the outer shoe, and left the inner shoe, surely it is Pasul. We require "me'Al Raglo", not from on top of his foot!</p>
<p class="bas indent2"><span class="nm">2.</span><span class="cl">Answer:</span> Rather, she tore the outer shoe and removed the inner shoe, and left the outer shoe on his foot;</p>
<p class="bas indent3"><span class="nm">i.</span>If removal of the shoe is required, this was done.</p>
<p class="bas indent3"><span class="nm">ii.</span>If she must expose the foot, this was not done.</p>
<p class="bas bbbline">102b----------------------------------------102b</p>
<p class="bas indent1"><span class="nm">(g)</span><span class="cl">Question:</span> Is it normal to wear a shoe on top of a shoe? (Tosfos - the Gemara often asks about unusual things. We ask because Chalitzah requires a shoe worn normally.)</p>
<p class="bas indent1"><span class="nm">(h)</span><span class="cl">Answer:</span> Yes! Rav Yehudah walked in the market wearing five pairs of cloth (felt) shoes.</p>
<p class="bas indent1"><span class="nm">(i)</span><span class="cl">(Rav Yehudah):</span> (Even) if a Yevamah grew up among the Yevamim, she may do Yibum. We are not concerned lest she took off the sandal of one of them</p>
<p class="bas indent1"><span class="nm">(j)</span><span class="cl">Inference:</span> If we knew that she took off his sandal, we would be concerned!</p>
<p class="bas indent1"><span class="nm">(k)</span><span class="cl">Question (Beraisa):</span> Whether he intended for Chalitzah, but she didn't; or if she intended for Chalitzah, but he didn't - the Chalitzah is invalid until both have intention.</p>
<p class="bas indent1"><span class="nm">(l)</span><span class="cl">Answer #1:</span> Rather, Rav Yehudah taught that even if we saw that she took off his sandal, we are not concerned lest they had intention.</p>
<p class="bas indent1"><span class="nm">(m)</span><span class="cl">Answer #2:</span> Indeed, if she took off a Yavam's sandal, we are concerned!</p>
<p class="bas indent2"><span class="nm">1.</span>The Beraisa teaches that Chalitzah without intent does not permit her l'Shuk, but she is forbidden to do Yibum.</p>
<p class="bas subject"><span class="nm">4)</span>FROM WHAT MUST THE SHOE BE MADE?</p>
<p class="bas indent1"><span class="nm">(a)</span><span class="cl">(Rav Yehudah):</span> A sandal stitched with linen may not be used for Chalitzah - "I gave you shoes of Tachash" (an animal whose hide was used to make a cover for the Mishkan).</p>
<p class="bas indent1"><span class="nm">(b)</span><span class="cl">Question:</span> If so, we should say that only Tachash may be used!</p>
<p class="bas indent1"><span class="nm">(c)</span><span class="cl">Answer:</span> The verse of Chalitzah says "shoe" twice, to include (leather of other animals).</p>
<p class="bas indent1"><span class="nm">(d)</span><span class="cl">Question:</span> If so, we should allow all materials!</p>
<p class="bas indent1"><span class="nm">(e)</span><span class="cl">Answer:</span> If so, what would we learn from the verse "Shoes of Tachash"?</p>
<p class="bas indent1"><span class="nm">(f)</span><span class="cl">Question (R. Elazar):</span> If a shoe is of leather and the straps are of goats' hair, may it be used?</p>
<p class="bas indent1"><span class="nm">(g)</span><span class="cl">Answer (Rav):</span> Yes, this is like Tachash.</p>
<p class="bas indent1"><span class="nm">(h)</span><span class="cl">Question:</span> If so, even if the entire shoe is of hair, it should be permitted!</p>
<p class="bas indent1"><span class="nm">(i)</span><span class="cl">Answer:</span> That is called Karka (like a Min'al - it is not called a shoe).</p>
<p class="bas subject"><span class="nm">5)</span>THE MEANING OF <i>CHALITZAH</i></p>
<p class="bas indent1"><span class="nm">(a)</span><span class="cl">Question (Rav Kahana):</span> How do we know that 'Choltzah' means that she removes?</p>
<p class="bas indent1"><span class="nm">(b)</span><span class="cl">Answer (Shmuel):</span> "V'Chaltzu (they will remove) the stones in which there is a plague".</p>
<p class="bas indent1"><span class="nm">(c)</span><span class="cl">Question:</span> Perhaps it means to invigorate (i.e. put on the shoe), like "Hechaltzu (prepare) from yourselves men for the army"!</p>
<p class="bas indent1"><span class="nm">(d)</span><span class="cl">Answer #1:</span> There also, it means to remove (men from their houses to go to fight).</p>
<p class="bas indent1"><span class="nm">(e)</span><span class="cl">Question:</span> It says "Yechaletz (He will support) a poor person in his poverty"!</p>
<p class="bas indent1"><span class="nm">(f)</span><span class="cl">Answer #1:</span> There also, his reward for bearing poverty will be removal of punishments in Gehenom".</p>
<p class="bas indent1"><span class="nm">(g)</span><span class="cl">Question:</span> It says "Hash-m's angel camps by those who fear Him va'Ychaltzem (and will save them)"!</p>
<p class="bas indent1"><span class="nm">(h)</span><span class="cl">Answer #1:</span> A reward for fearing Hash-m will be exemption from punishment in Gehenom.</p>
<p class="bas indent1"><span class="nm">(i)</span><span class="cl">Question:</span> It says "And your bones Yachalitz";</p>
<p class="bas indent2"><span class="nm">1.</span><span class="cl">(R. Elazar):</span> This is the greatest of the blessings.</p>
<p class="bas indent2"><span class="nm">2.</span><span class="cl">(Rava):</span> This is strengthening of the bones.</p>
<p class="bas indent1"><span class="nm">(j)</span><span class="cl">Answer:</span> Indeed, the word can mean to strengthen or to remove. Regarding Chalitzah, had it meant strengthening (putting on) it would have said 'On his foot'. <span class="note">(<span class="notewd">Note:</span> It seems that this is another answer for questions (c), (e) and (g).)</span></p>
<p class="bas indent1"><span class="nm">(k)</span><span class="cl">Objection:</span> Had it said 'On his foot', one might have thought that it must be done on the foot, but not the shin. "Me'Al Raglo" teaches that the shin is also acceptable!</p>
<p class="bas indent1"><span class="nm">(l)</span><span class="cl">Answer:</span> Had it meant that she puts on his shoe, it would have said 'b'me'Al' (to include the shin). "Me'Al" teaches that she removes the shoe.</p>
<p class="bas indent1"><span class="nm">(m)</span><span class="cl">A heretic:</span> Hash-m cast off your nation - "... Chalatz from them"!</p>

<p class="bas indent1"><span class="nm">(a)</span><span class="cl">(Mishnah):</span> Chalitzah with an Anpilya (slipper or sock) is invalid.</p>
<p class="bas indent1"><span class="nm">(b)</span><span class="cl">Inference:</span> An Anpilya is not a Min'al.</p>
<p class="bas indent1"><span class="nm">(c)</span><span class="cl">Support (Mishnah):</span> One who comes to take Terumas ha'Lishkah (Shekalim to buy Korbanos Tzibur) does not enter the room wearing a cloak with a hem (lest people suspect that he hid Shekalim for himself in the hem) nor with Anpilya. We need not forbid with a Min'al or sandal, since no one may enter the Mikdash wearing a Min'al or sandal.</p>
<p class="bas indent1"><span class="nm">(d)</span><span class="cl">Contradiction (Beraisa):</span> A Min'al, sandal and Anpilya all have the same law (on Yom Kipur). One may not walk in them from house to house, nor from bed to bed.</p>
<p class="bas indent1"><span class="nm">(e)</span><span class="cl">Answer #1 (Abaye):</span> The Anpilya in the Beraisa has soft wads in it, and is forbidden because it is pleasurable.</p>
<p class="bas indent1"><span class="nm">(f)</span><span class="cl">Objection (Rava):</span> If it is not a Min'al, it is not forbidden on Yom Kipur just because it is pleasurable!</p>
<p class="bas indent2"><span class="nm">1.</span>Rabah bar Rav Huna went out with a turban wrapped on his leg!</p>
<p class="bas indent1"><span class="nm">(g)</span><span class="cl">Answer #2 (Rava):</span> A cloth Anpilya is not like a shoe; a leather Anpilya is.</p>
<p class="bas indent1"><span class="nm">(h)</span><span class="cl">Support:</span> If we will not say so, there is a contradiction between Beraisos about Yom Kipur!</p>
<p class="bas indent2"><span class="nm">1.</span><span class="cl">(Beraisa):</span> A person may not walk in Kordakisin (undershoes worn to protect from water) in his house, but he may walk in Anpilin in his house.</p>
