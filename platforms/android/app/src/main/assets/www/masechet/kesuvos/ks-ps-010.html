<div class="subject"><span class="nm">1)</span><p>IS KESUVAH MID'ORAISA OR MID'RABANAN?</p></div>
<div class="indent1"><span class="nm">(a)</span><p><span class="cl">(Rav Nachman):</span> Chachamim enacted that a virgin gets a Kesuvah of 200 Zuz and a widow gets a Kesuvah of 100. They also enacted that if he claims Pesach Pasu'ach, he is believed.</p></div>
<div class="indent1"><span class="nm">(b)</span><p><span class="cl">Question:</span> If so, the enactment does not help! (Every Chasan can exempt himself.)</p></div>
<div class="indent1"><span class="nm">(c)</span><p><span class="cl">Answer (Rava):</span> We have a Chazakah (a law of human nature) that a person does not toil to make a feast and spoil it (i.e. make a false claim and divorce her immediately).</p></div>
<div class="indent1"><span class="nm">(d)</span><p><span class="cl">(Beraisa #1):</span> Since it is a fine of the Chachamim, she collects only from Ziburis (lowest quality land).</p></div>
<div class="indent1"><span class="nm">(e)</span><p><span class="cl">Objection:</span> The Kesuvah is not a fine!</p></div>
<div class="indent1"><span class="nm">(f)</span><p><span class="cl">Retraction:</span> Rather, since it is an enactment of the Chachamim, she collects only from Ziburis.</p></div>
<div class="indent1"><span class="nm">(g)</span><p><span class="cl">(Seifa - R. Shimon ben Gamliel):</span> The Kesuvah is a Torah concept.</p></div>
<div class="indent1"><span class="nm">(h)</span><p><span class="cl">Question:</span> This contradicts what he said in a Beraisa!</p></div>
<div class="indent2"><span class="nm">1.</span><p><span class="cl">(Beraisa #2):</span> "Money... like the Mohar of virgins" teaches that the Mohar (Kesuvah) of a virgin should be like the fine for a seducer, 50 Shekalim. This was Chachamim's source in the Torah for the Kesuvah;</p></div>
<div class="indent2"><span class="nm">2.</span><p>R. Shimon ben Gamliel says, the Kesuvah is only mid'Rabanan.</p></div>
<div class="indent1"><span class="nm">(i)</span><p><span class="cl">Answer #1:</span> We must switch the opinions in Beraisa #2.</p></div>
<div class="indent2"><span class="nm">1.</span><p><span class="cl">Question:</span> Why don't we switch the opinions in Beraisa #1?</p></div>
<div class="indent2"><span class="nm">2.</span><p><span class="cl">Answer:</span> Elsewhere, we find that R. Shimon ben Gamliel says that the Kesuvah is mid'Oraisa.</p></div>
<div class="indent3"><span class="nm">i.</span><p><span class="cl">(Mishnah - R. Shimon ben Gamliel):</span> One pays the Kesuvah with coins of Keputkiya (which are larger).</p></div>
<div class="indent1"><span class="nm">(j)</span><p><span class="cl">Answer #2:</span> The entire second Beraisa is R. Shimon ben Gamliel. It reads as follows:</p></div>
<div class="indent2"><span class="nm">1.</span><p>This is the support that Kesuvah is mid'Oraisa. The Kesuvah of a widow is only mid'Rabanan, like R. Shimon ben Gamliel says.</p></div>
<div class="subject"><span class="nm">2)</span><p>CASES OF CLAIMS OF PESACH PASU'ACH</p></div>
<div class="indent1"><span class="nm">(a)</span><p>A man came to Rav Nachman and claimed Pesach Pasu'ach.</p></div>
<div class="indent1"><span class="nm">(b)</span><p><span class="cl">Rav Nachman:</span> Lash him with date branches! If he knows this, he must be regular with the harlots of the city!</p></div>
<div class="indent1"><span class="nm">(c)</span><p><span class="cl">Question:</span> But Rav Nachman said that a man is believed to say that the opening was open!</p></div>
<div class="indent1"><span class="nm">(d)</span><p><span class="cl">Answer #1:</span> He is believed, and he is lashed.</p></div>
<div class="indent1"><span class="nm">(e)</span><p><span class="cl">Answer #2 (Rav Ashi):</span> If he was previously married he is believed. If not, he is lashed..</p></div>
<div class="indent1"><span class="nm">(f)</span><p>A man came to R. Gamliel and claimed Pesach Pasu'ach.</p></div>
<div class="indent1"><span class="nm">(g)</span><p><span class="cl">Version #1 - R. Gamliel:</span> Perhaps you did Hatiyah.</p></div>
<div class="indent2"><span class="nm">1.</span><p>This is comparable to a man walking in the dark (and he came to his door. There was an obstruction that did not allow the door to open.) If he tilted the obstruction to the side, he will find the door open. If not, he will find it locked.</p></div>
<div class="indent1"><span class="nm">(h)</span><p><span class="cl">Version #2 - R. Gamliel:</span> Perhaps you intentionally did Hatiyah and uprooted the door and the bolt!</p></div>
<div class="indent2"><span class="nm">1.</span><p>This is comparable to a man walking in the dark. If he intentionally aside the obstruction, he will find the door open. If not, he will find it locked.</p></div>
<div class="subject"><span class="nm">3)</span><p>CASES WHERE NO BLOOD WAS FOUND</p></div>
<div class="indent1"><span class="nm">(a)</span><p>A man came to R. Gamliel and said that he had Bi'ah Rishonah, and there was no blood.</p></div>
<div class="indent1"><span class="nm">(b)</span><p><span class="cl">The Kalah:</span> I was a virgin!</p></div>
<div class="indent1"><span class="nm">(c)</span><p>R. Gamliel inspected the cloth, soaked and washed it, and founds drops of blood. He told the man that she was a virgin.</p></div>
<div class="indent2"><span class="nm">1.</span><p><span class="cl">Suggestion (Huna Mar brei d'Rava mi'Parzika):</span> We should do similarly!</p></div>
<div class="bbbline">10b----------------------------------------10b</p></div>
<div class="indent2"><span class="nm">2.</span><p><span class="cl">Rejection (Rav Ashi):</span> Our ironing (in Bavel) is like their washing (in Eretz Yisrael, but our washing is inferior to theirs. Perhaps the blood will not be found.)</p></div>
<div class="indent2"><span class="nm">3.</span><p><span class="cl">Suggestion:</span> We can iron the cloth (this is like washing in Eretz Yisrael)!</p></div>
<div class="indent2"><span class="nm">4.</span><p><span class="cl">Rejection:</span> This will remove the blood.</p></div>
<div class="indent1"><span class="nm">(d)</span><p>A man came to R. Gamliel bar Rebbi and said that he had Bi'ah Rishonah, and there was no blood.</p></div>
<div class="indent1"><span class="nm">(e)</span><p><span class="cl">The Kalah:</span> I am still a virgin!</p></div>
<div class="indent1"><span class="nm">(f)</span><p>R. Gamliel bar Rebbi brought two slaves, a virgin and a non-virgin. He put them on top of a barrel of wine. One could smell the wine through the mouth of the non-virgin, but not from the mouth of the virgin.</p></div>
<div class="indent2"><span class="nm">1.</span><p>The Kalah went on top of the barrel. The wine could not be smelled through her mouth. R. Gamliel told the man that she is a virgin.</p></div>
<div class="indent1"><span class="nm">(g)</span><p><span class="cl">Question:</span> Why didn't he test only the Kalah?</p></div>
<div class="indent1"><span class="nm">(h)</span><p><span class="cl">Answer:</span> He had heard about the test, but had never seen it done, and was unsure if he properly understood it. It is not proper to disgrace Benos Yisrael.</p></div>
<div class="indent1"><span class="nm">(i)</span><p>A man came to R. Gamliel the elder and said that he had Bi'ah Rishonah, and there was no blood.</p></div>
<div class="indent1"><span class="nm">(j)</span><p><span class="cl">The Kalah:</span> I am from the family of Dorketi. We do not have menstrual or virginal blood!</p></div>
<div class="indent1"><span class="nm">(k)</span><p>R. Gamliel found that this was true. He told the man that he was fortunate to get a girl from the family of Dorketi.</p></div>
<div class="indent2"><span class="nm">1.</span><p><span class="cl">Question:</span> Why is the family called 'Dorketi'?</p></div>
<div class="indent2"><span class="nm">2.</span><p><span class="cl">Answer:</span> It is a Dor Katu'a (cut off).</p></div>
<div class="indent1"><span class="nm">(l)</span><p><span class="cl">R. Chanina:</span> R. Gamliel gave the man false consolation!</p></div>
<div class="indent2"><span class="nm">1.</span><p><span class="cl">(R. Chiya):</span> Just like sourdough is good for (fermenting) a dough, so blood is good for a woman.</p></div>
<div class="indent2"><span class="nm">2.</span><p><span class="cl">(R. Meir):</span> A woman with much blood will have many children.</p></div>
<div class="indent1"><span class="nm">(m)</span><p><span class="cl">(R. Yirmiyah bar Aba):</span> R. Gamliel said 'acquire your (good) purchase'.</p></div>
<div class="indent1"><span class="nm">(n)</span><p><span class="cl">(R. Yosi bar Avin):</span> he said 'you made a bad purchase'.</p></div>
<div class="indent1"><span class="nm">(o)</span><p><span class="cl">Question:</span> We understand why he would say that it was a bad purchase, for she is not fitting for children. But according to R. Yirmiyah, why did he consider it a good acquisition?</p></div>
<div class="indent1"><span class="nm">(p)</span><p><span class="cl">Answer:</span> He will not be in doubt whether or not his wife is a Nidah.</p></div>
<div class="indent1"><span class="nm">(q)</span><p>A man came to Rebbi and said that there was no blood from Bi'ah Rishonah.</p></div>
<div class="indent1"><span class="nm">(r)</span><p><span class="cl">The Kalah:</span> I am still a virgin!</p></div>
<div class="indent1"><span class="nm">(s)</span><p>It was a time of famine. Rebbi bathed them and gave them to eat and drink. They had Bi'ah again, and there was blood. "Their skin stuck to their bones, it was as dry as wood".</p></div>
<div class="subject"><span class="nm">4)</span><p>THE KESUVAH OF A WIDOW</p></div>
<div class="indent1"><span class="nm">(a)</span><p><span class="cl">(Mishnah):</span> The Kesuvah of a virgin is 200 Zuz. That of a widow is 100. If a virgin was widowed, divorced or did Chalitzah from Eirusin, her Kesuvah is 200, and there is Ta'anas Besulim.</p></div>
<div class="indent1"><span class="nm">(b)</span><p><span class="cl">(Gemara - Rav Chana Bagdata'ah):</span> A widow is called an <i>Almanah</i> because her Kesuvah is a Manah (100 Zuz).</p></div>
<div class="indent1"><span class="nm">(c)</span><p><span class="cl">Question:</span> The Kesuvah of a widow from Eirusin is 200!</p></div>
<div class="indent1"><span class="nm">(d)</span><p><span class="cl">Answer:</span> Since we call a widow from Nisu'in Almanah, also a widow from Eirusin is called Almanah.</p></div>
<div class="indent1"><span class="nm">(e)</span><p><span class="cl">Question:</span> Why does it say "Almanah" in the Torah? (Mid'Oraisa, a widow has no Kesuvah!)</p></div>
<div class="indent1"><span class="nm">(f)</span><p><span class="cl">Answer:</span> It is because Chachamim would later make this enactment.</p></div>
<div class="indent1"><span class="nm">(g)</span><p><span class="cl">Question:</span> Would the Torah give a name based on the future?</p></div>
<div class="indent1"><span class="nm">(h)</span><p>Yes! Rav Yosef taught a Beraisa that says that "The Chidekel River... to the east of <i>Ashur</i>" refers to the city of Slika, which was built later.</p></div>
<div class="indent1"><span class="nm">(i)</span><p><span class="cl">(Rav Chana Bagdata'ah):</span> Rain does the following: waters, satiates, fertilizes, rejuvenates, and extends;</p></div>
<div class="indent1"><span class="nm">(j)</span><p>(Rava bar R. Yishmael):	He learns from "Telameha Rave Naches..." (David requested that Hash-m send rain, which does all of these).</p></div>
<div class="indent1"><span class="nm">(k)</span><p><span class="cl">(R. Elazar):</span> The MiZBe'aCH is MeZi'aCH, MeZin, MeCHaVev, and MeCHaper (diverts (sins), feeds, endears, and atones).</p></div>
<div class="indent2"><span class="nm">1.</span><p><span class="cl">Question:</span> Diverting (sins) is the same as atoning!</p></div>
<div class="indent2"><span class="nm">2.</span><p><span class="cl">Answer:</span> It diverts harsh decrees.</p></div>
<div class="indent1"><span class="nm">(l)</span><p><span class="cl">(Rav Chana Bagdata'ah):</span> Dates warm (people), satiate, promote bowel movement, invigorate, but do not make one finicky.</p></div>
<div class="indent1"><span class="nm">(m)</span><p><span class="cl">(Rav):</span> One who ate dates may not give Hora'ah (a Halachic ruling, for dates befuddle).</p></div>
<div class="indent1"><span class="nm">(n)</span><p><span class="cl">Question (Beraisa):</span> Dates are good in the morning and evening. They are bad in the afternoon. They are unmatched at noon. They overcome three things: bad thoughts (worry), and sicknesses of the intestines and abdomen.</p></div>
<div class="indent1"><span class="nm">(o)</span><p><span class="cl">Answer #1:</span> Rav did not say that dates are not good. They are good, just they temporarily befuddle, just like wine;</p></div>
<div class="indent2"><span class="nm">1.</span><p>One who drinks a Revi'is of wine may not give Hora'ah.</p></div>
<div class="indent1"><span class="nm">(p)</span><p><span class="cl">Answer #2:</span> Dates are bad before eating bread, but good after bread.</p></div>
<div class="indent2"><span class="nm">1.</span><p><span class="cl">(Abaye):</span> My (surrogate) mother told me that dates before bread are like an axe to a date tree. After bread they are like a bolt to a door.</p></div>
<div class="indent1"><span class="nm">(q)</span><p><span class="cl">(Rava):</span> DaSHa (door) is an acronym for Derech SHam (there is the way). DaRGa (ladder) is an acronym for DeRech Gag (a way to the roof).</p></div>
<div class="indent1"><span class="nm">(r)</span><p><span class="cl">(Rav Papa):</span> PuRiya (bed) is an acronym for Parim u'Ravim (people procreate) on it.</p></div>
<div class="indent1"><span class="nm">(s)</span><p><span class="cl">(Rav Nachman bar Yitzchak):</span> Ailonis (a girl who does not develop like a normal female) is based on Ayil (a male ram, that does not bear children).</p></div>
