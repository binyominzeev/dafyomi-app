<p class="bas subject"><span class="nm">1)</span>CRAFTSMEN WHO DEVIATED</p>
<p class="bas indent1"><span class="nm">(a)</span><span class="cl">(Beraisa - R. Meir):</span> If Reuven gave wood to a carpenter to make a chair, and he made a bench, or vice-versa, he pays the value of the wood he received;</p>
<p class="bas indent1"><span class="nm">(b)</span>R. Yehudah says, Reuven pays the increased value or the expenses, whichever is smaller.</p>
<p class="bas indent1"><span class="nm">(c)</span>R. Meir admits that if he was told to make a nice chair or bench and made an unsightly one, Reuven pays the increased value or the expenses, whichever is smaller.</p>
<p class="bas subject"><span class="nm">2)</span>ARE WE CONCERNED FOR CHANGED APPEARANCE?</p>
<p class="bas indent1"><span class="nm">(a)</span><span class="cl">Question:</span> Do we say that wool increases in value due to ingredients (of dye)?</p>
<p class="bas indent2"><span class="nm">1.</span><span class="cl">Question:</span> What is the case?</p>
<p class="bas indent3"><span class="nm">i.</span>If Reuven stole Shimon's ingredients, grated them, soaked them and dyed his own wool with them, he already acquired them by changing them (and must pay for them)!</p>
<p class="bas indent2"><span class="nm">2.</span><span class="cl">Answer #1:</span> Rather, Shimon's ingredients were already soaking, and Reuven dyed his own wool with them.</p>
<p class="bas indent3"><span class="nm">i.</span>If we say that the ingredients increase the value of the wool, Shimon can demand compensation;</p>
<p class="bas indent3"><span class="nm">ii.</span>If there is no increased value on the wool, Reuven can say 'I don't have anything of yours'.</p>
<p class="bas indent2"><span class="nm">3.</span><span class="cl">Objection:</span> Even if there is no increased value on the wool, Reuven must pay for depriving Shimon of his ingredients!</p>
<p class="bas indent2"><span class="nm">4.</span><span class="cl">Answer:</span> Rather, if we say that the wool did not increase in value, Reuven pays for the ingredients;</p>
<p class="bas indent3"><span class="nm">i.</span>If the increased value is on the wool, Reuven can say 'here is the wool. Take your ingredients back.'</p>
<p class="bas indent2"><span class="nm">5.</span><span class="cl">Question:</span> How can he take them back?</p>
<p class="bas indent2"><span class="nm">6.</span><span class="cl">Answer:</span> He can wash the wool with soap.</p>
<p class="bas indent2"><span class="nm">7.</span><span class="cl">Objection:</span> Soap can remove the dye from the wool, but it cannot restore the dye!</p>
<p class="bas indent2"><span class="nm">8.</span><span class="cl">Answer #2:</span> Rather, Reuven stole Shimon's wool and ingredients, dyed the wool and returned it.</p>
<p class="bas indent3"><span class="nm">i.</span>If we say that the increased value due to the ingredients is on the wool, Reuven returned everything;</p>
<p class="bas indent3"><span class="nm">ii.</span>If the value of the ingredients is not on the wool, Reuven did not return the ingredients and he must pay for them.</p>
<p class="bas indent2"><span class="nm">9.</span><span class="cl">Question:</span> It should suffice that he returned wool worth more than what he stole!</p>
<p class="bas indent2"><span class="nm">10.</span><span class="cl">Answer #1:</span> The price of dye declined (so the increased value is less than the value of the ingredients he stole).</p>
<p class="bas indent2"><span class="nm">11.</span><span class="cl">Answer #2:</span> He dyed a monkey (some say - a box). It is not worth more due to the dye.</p>
<p class="bas indent2"><span class="nm">12.</span><span class="cl">Answer #3 (to Question (1) - Ravina):</span> A monkey dyed Reuven's wool with Shimon's ingredients;</p>
<p class="bas indent3"><span class="nm">i.</span>If there is increased value due to the ingredients on the wool, Reuven must compensate Shimon;</p>
<p class="bas indent3"><span class="nm">ii.</span>If there is no increased value, Reuven is exempt.</p>
<p class="bas indent1"><span class="nm">(b)</span><span class="cl">Answer #1 (Mishnah):</span> If a garment was dyed with peels of (fruit of) Orlah, it must be burned.</p>
<p class="bas indent2"><span class="nm">1.</span>This teaches that the appearance is significant (it increases the value)!</p>
<p class="bas indent1"><span class="nm">(c)</span><span class="cl">Rejection (Rava):</span> Orlah is special. The Torah forbids any visible benefit from Orlah;</p>
<p class="bas indent2"><span class="nm">1.</span><span class="cl">(Beraisa):</span> "Do not eat Areilim" forbids eating;</p>
<p class="bas indent2"><span class="nm">2.</span>Earlier, the verse says "Va'araltem Orlaso (its Orlah will be closed (forbidden) to you), its fruit." This forbids benefit, dying, or burning a lamp with Orlah.</p>
<p class="bas indent1"><span class="nm">(d)</span><span class="cl">Answer #2 (Beraisa):</span> If a garment was dyed with peels of (fruit of) Shemitah, it must be burned.</p>
<p class="bas indent1"><span class="nm">(e)</span><span class="cl">Rejection:</span> Shemitah is special. It says "it will be" to teach that the appearance counts.</p>
<p class="bas bbbline">101b----------------------------------------101b</p>
<p class="bas indent1"><span class="nm">(f)</span><span class="cl">Question (Rava):</span> Mishnayos differ about whether or not appearance is significant!</p>
<p class="bas indent2"><span class="nm">1.</span><span class="cl">(Mishnah #1):</span> If a garment was dyed with peels of Orlah, it must be burned.</p>
<p class="bas indent3"><span class="nm">i.</span>This teaches that the appearance is significant.</p>
<p class="bas indent2"><span class="nm">2.</span><span class="cl">Contradiction (Mishnah #2):</span> If a Revi'is of blood was absorbed in the floor of a house, (Kelim in) the house are Tehorim. Some say that they are Teme'im;</p>
<p class="bas indent3"><span class="nm">i.</span>Really, these two opinions do not argue. Kelim in the house before the blood was absorbed are Teme'im. Those that entered the house after it was absorbed are Tehorim.</p>
<p class="bas indent2"><span class="nm">3.</span><span class="cl">(Continuation of Mishnah #2):</span> If a Revi'is of blood was absorbed in a garment, (it is Tamei, but) it has Tum'as Ohel (it is Metamei what is over or below it or under a common roof) if a Revi'is of blood will come out through washing it. (This shows that the mere appearance of blood makes no difference!)</p>
<p class="bas indent1"><span class="nm">(g)</span><span class="cl">Answer (Rav Kahana):</span> (Normally, appearance is significant.) Mishnah #2 discusses Tevusah blood (we are unsure if it came out before or after death). Since its Tum'as Ohel is only mid'Rabanan, Chachamim were lenient.</p>
<p class="bas subject"><span class="nm">3)</span>WOOD OF <i>SHEMITAH</i></p>
<p class="bas indent1"><span class="nm">(a)</span><span class="cl">Question (Rava):</span> An anonymous Mishnah and Beraisa disagree about whether or not wood has Kedushah of Shemitah!</p>
<p class="bas indent2"><span class="nm">1.</span><span class="cl">(Mishnah):</span> If plants used for dyes, such as saffron or woad, grew by themselves in Shemitah, Kedushas Shemitah and Bi'ur (one must get rid of them when they are not available in the field) applies to them and money used to buy them.</p>
<p class="bas indent3"><span class="nm">i.</span>This shows that wood has Kedushah of Shemitah.</p>
<p class="bas indent2"><span class="nm">2.</span><span class="cl">(Beraisa):</span> (If stalks of) reeds or vines were stored up:</p>
<p class="bas indent3"><span class="nm">i.</span>If they were stored to be eaten (by animals), they have Kedushah of Shemitah;</p>
<p class="bas indent3"><span class="nm">ii.</span>If they were stored (to be burned) like wood, they do not have Kedushah of Shemitah.</p>
<p class="bas indent1"><span class="nm">(b)</span><span class="cl">Answer (Rava):</span> Regarding Shemitah it says "to eat". This is benefit derived at the same time that the Peros are consumed;</p>
<p class="bas indent2"><span class="nm">1.</span>This excludes wood, for the (primary) benefit (heat) comes after it is consumed (i.e. when it is coals).</p>
<p class="bas indent1"><span class="nm">(c)</span><span class="cl">Question:</span> If so, Kedushah of Shemitah should apply to oil-coated wood, for it can serve like a torch. It illuminates at the same time that the wood is consumed!</p>
<p class="bas indent1"><span class="nm">(d)</span><span class="cl">Answer (Rava):</span> Normally, wood is gathered to be burned (for heat, not illumination).</p>
<p class="bas indent1"><span class="nm">(e)</span><span class="cl">(Rav Kahana):</span> Tana'im argue about whether or not wood has Kedushas Shemitah.</p>
<p class="bas indent2"><span class="nm">1.</span><span class="cl">(Beraisa):</span> Peros (e.g. wine) of Shemitah may not be used for soaking (flax) or laundering;</p>
<p class="bas indent2"><span class="nm">2.</span>R. Yosi permits this.</p>
<p class="bas indent1"><span class="nm">(f)</span><span class="cl">Question:</span> What is Chachamim's reason?</p>
<p class="bas indent1"><span class="nm">(g)</span><span class="cl">Answer:</span> It says "to eat" - not to soak or launder;</p>
<p class="bas indent2"><span class="nm">1.</span>R. Yosi expounds "for you" - for all your needs.</p>
<p class="bas indent1"><span class="nm">(h)</span><span class="cl">Question:</span> What do Chachamim learn from "for you"?</p>
<p class="bas indent1"><span class="nm">(i)</span><span class="cl">Answer:</span> It includes other needs, but only those similar to eating, in which the benefit comes at the same time that the Peros are consumed;</p>
<p class="bas indent2"><span class="nm">1.</span>This excludes soaking and laundering, for the wine is ruined immediately, and the benefit comes much later.</p>
<p class="bas indent1"><span class="nm">(j)</span><span class="cl">Question:</span> How does R. Yosi expound "to eat"?</p>
<p class="bas indent1"><span class="nm">(k)</span><span class="cl">Answer (Beraisa):</span> "(The Peros are) to eat", not for a bandage.</p>
<p class="bas indent2"><span class="nm">1.</span><span class="cl">Suggestion:</span> Perhaps we should rather exclude laundering!</p>
<p class="bas indent2"><span class="nm">2.</span><span class="cl">Rejection:</span> "For you" permits laundering.</p>
<p class="bas indent2"><span class="nm">3.</span><span class="cl">Question:</span> Perhaps we should learn the other way! Perhaps "to eat" forbids laundering, and "for you" permits a bandage!</p>
<p class="bas indent2"><span class="nm">4.</span><span class="cl">Answer:</span> It is more reasonable to permit laundering, which everyone needs, than a bandage, which not everyone needs.</p>
<p class="bas indent1"><span class="nm">(l)</span><span class="cl">Question:</span> Like whom is the following Beraisa?</p>
<p class="bas indent2"><span class="nm">1.</span><span class="cl">(Beraisa):</span> "(The Peros are) to eat", not for a bandage, not to sprinkle wine on the floor (to scent the house), and not to induce vomiting.</p>
<p class="bas indent1"><span class="nm">(m)</span><span class="cl">Answer:</span> It is like R. Yosi. If it were like Chachamim, it would also exclude soaking and laundry.</p>
