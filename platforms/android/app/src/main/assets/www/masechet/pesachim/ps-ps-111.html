<div class="subject"><span class="nm">1)</span><p>DANGERS ON ACCOUNT OF RU'ACH RA'AH</p></div>
<div class="indent1"><span class="nm">(a)</span><p><span class="cl">(Reish Lakish):</span> If one does any of the following four things [which cause Ru'ach Ra'ah], he is responsible for his own death - moving his bowels between a date tree and a wall; passing between two date trees; drinking borrowed water; and passing over spilled wastewater, even if his wife spilled it in front of him.</p></div>
<div class="indent1"><span class="nm">(b)</span><p>If there are four Amos between a date tree and a wall, one may eliminate there (Shedim will not harm him for they can pass through);</p></div>
<div class="indent2"><span class="nm">1.</span><p>Even if there are not four Amos, if there is another path there is no problem.</p></div>
<div class="indent1"><span class="nm">(c)</span><p>If Reshus ha'Rabim is between two date trees, one may pass between them (Shedim may not harm public thoroughfares).</p></div>
<div class="indent1"><span class="nm">(d)</span><p>If an adult borrowed water, one may drink it - it is problematic only if a child borrowed it;</p></div>
<div class="indent2"><span class="nm">1.</span><p>Even if a child borrowed it, it is problematic only in the field, where water is scarce (Shedim fight fiercely for it), but not in the city, where it is plentiful.</p></div>
<div class="indent2"><span class="nm">2.</span><p>Even in a field, only water is problematic, but not wine or beer.</p></div>
<div class="indent1"><span class="nm">(e)</span><p>If dirt was put on spilled wastewater or if one spit into it, one may pass over it;</p></div>
<div class="indent1"><span class="nm">(f)</span><p>If the sun shone on it or 60 feet passed over it, there is no problem.</p></div>
<div class="indent1"><span class="nm">(g)</span><p>If he is riding on a donkey or wearing sandals, there is no problem.</p></div>
<div class="indent1"><span class="nm">(h)</span><p>These leniencies are regarding Shedim, but where there is concern for witchcraft, they do not help;</p></div>
<div class="indent2"><span class="nm">1.</span><p>A man was riding on a donkey and wearing sandals [and passed over wastewater] - his sandals and feet dried up.</p></div>
<div class="indent1"><span class="nm">(i)</span><p><span class="cl">(Beraisa):</span> There are three things that [no one of them] should not be allowed to pass [between two men], and one should not pass between [a pair of] them - dogs, date trees and women;</p></div>
<div class="indent1"><span class="nm">(j)</span><p>Some say, also pigs; some say, also snakes.</p></div>
<div class="indent1"><span class="nm">(k)</span><p><span class="cl">Question:</span> If one passed between them, what remedy is there for this?</p></div>
<div class="indent1"><span class="nm">(l)</span><p><span class="cl">Answer (Rav Papa):</span> He should [say the verses that] begin with 'Kel' and end with 'Kel' ("Kel Motzi'am mi'Mitzrayim...; ...Mah Po'al Kel"; Maharsha - in the middle are allusions to Shedim and witchcraft - "Lo Nachash b'Yisrael...");</p></div>
<div class="indent2"><span class="nm">1.</span><p>Alternatively, he should begin and end with 'Lo' ("Lo Ish Kel...v'Lo Yekimenu." Tosfos - we may not use Divrei Torah to heal, but we may use them to protect.)</p></div>
<div class="indent1"><span class="nm">(m)</span><p>If a Nidah walked between two men:</p></div>
<div class="indent2"><span class="nm">1.</span><p>If she was beginning Nidah, this will cause one of them to die (some say that Esther invited Haman to the banquet in order to walk between him and the king, according to the opinion that she turned Nidah - Megilah 15A. Some say that she can kill one through witchcraft);</p></div>
<div class="indent2"><span class="nm">2.</span><p>If she was at the end of Nidah, this will cause the men to quarrel.</p></div>
<div class="indent1"><span class="nm">(n)</span><p><span class="cl">Question:</span> If she passed between them, what remedy is there?</p></div>
<div class="indent1"><span class="nm">(o)</span><p><span class="cl">Answer (Rav Papa):</span> They should begin and end with 'Kel'.</p></div>

<div class="indent1"><span class="nm">(a)</span><p>If two women sit at the crossroads on opposite sides of the road facing each other, surely they are doing witchcraft!</p></div>
<div class="indent1"><span class="nm">(b)</span><p><span class="cl">Question:</span> What should one do?</p></div>
<div class="indent1"><span class="nm">(c)</span><p><span class="cl">Answer:</span> If there is another path, he should take it;</p></div>
<div class="indent2"><span class="nm">1.</span><p>If not - if there is another man with him, they should walk through together;</p></div>
<div class="indent2"><span class="nm">2.</span><p>If there is no other man, he should say 'Agra Azalta...' (an incantation; these are Shedim used for witchcraft, and it says they were already killed).</p></div>
<div class="indent1"><span class="nm">(d)</span><p>If one encounters a woman returning from immersing [to permit her to her husband], the first of them to have relations will receive a spirit of Zenus (illicit relations. Tosfos (Bava Metzi'a 84A) - R. Yochanan used to sit where women would see him after immersing - this is not called 'encountering'. Alternatively, it is a problem only if he sees her undressed.)</p></div>
<div class="indent1"><span class="nm">(e)</span><p><span class="cl">Question:</span> What should one do?</p></div>
<div class="indent1"><span class="nm">(f)</span><p><span class="cl">Answer:</span> He should say "Shofech Buz Al Nedivim va'Yas'em b'Sohu Lo Derech."</p></div>
<div class="indent1"><span class="nm">(g)</span><p><span class="cl">(R. Yitzchak) Question:</span> What does it mean "Gam Ki Elech b'Gei <i>Tzalmaves</i>..." (the shadow of death)?</p></div>
<div class="indent1"><span class="nm">(h)</span><p><span class="cl">Answer:</span> This refers to one who sleeps in the shadow of a lone date tree or in a moonlight shadow.</p></div>
<div class="indent2"><span class="nm">1.</span><p>The shadow of a date tree is not dangerous if the shadow of another date tree reaches it (Shedim will go to the other tree);</p></div>
<div class="indent1"><span class="nm">(i)</span><p><span class="cl">Question:</span> A Beraisa teaches that if one sleeps in the shadow of a lone date tree <i>in a Chatzer</i> or in a moonlight shadow, he is responsible for his own death - what is the case?</p></div>
<div class="indent2"><span class="nm">1.</span><p>If the shadow of another date tree does not reach it, the same applies in a field!</p></div>
<div class="indent1"><span class="nm">(j)</span><p><span class="cl">Answer:</span> The shadow of another date tree reaches it - nevertheless, it is dangerous in a Chatzer.</p></div>
<div class="indent1"><span class="nm">(k)</span><p>A moonlight shadow is dangerous only if it is western [at the end of the month, when the moon is in the east] - an eastern shadow [at the start of the month, when the moon is in the west] is no problem.</p></div>

<div class="indent1"><span class="nm">(n)</span><p>If one steps over a [fallen] palm tree - if it was cut down, he will be killed; if it was uprooted, he will die.</p></div>

<div class="subject"><span class="nm">3)</span><p>SHEDIM OF PARTICULAR PLACES</p></div>
<div class="indent1"><span class="nm">(a)</span><p>Ru'ach Ra'ah dwells in four shadows - of a lone date tree, of a Kanda (Shizaf, i.e. jujube) tree, of a caper bush, and of a sorb tree;</p></div>
<div class="indent1"><span class="nm">(b)</span><p>Some say, it dwells even in shadow of a boat or willow tree.</p></div>
<div class="indent1"><span class="nm">(c)</span><p>The general rule is, it dwells in the shadow of any tree with many branches or whose wood is hard, except for Karu Masha (a kind of sorb tree) - even though its wood is hard, its shadow is fine;</p></div>
<div class="indent2"><span class="nm">1.</span><p>A Shed told her son 'stay away from Karu Masha - it killed your father, and it can kill you!'</p></div>
<div class="indent1"><span class="nm">(d)</span><p><span class="cl">Rav Ashi:</span> I saw that Rav Kahana avoided all shadows.</p></div>
<div class="indent1"><span class="nm">(e)</span><p>The Shed of caper bushes is called Ruchi, that of sorb trees is Sheida, that of roofs is Rishpi.</p></div>
<div class="indent1"><span class="nm">(f)</span><p><span class="cl">Question:</span> What difference does it make?</p></div>
<div class="indent1"><span class="nm">(g)</span><p><span class="cl">Answer:</span> This is useful for writing amulets [to heal one harmed by them].</p></div>
<div class="indent1"><span class="nm">(h)</span><p>The Shed of caper bushes has no eyes.</p></div>
<div class="indent1"><span class="nm">(i)</span><p><span class="cl">Question:</span> What difference does it make?</p></div>
<div class="indent1"><span class="nm">(j)</span><p><span class="cl">Answer:</span> One can flee from it, for it cannot follow him.</p></div>
<div class="indent1"><span class="nm">(k)</span><p>Once, a Chacham went to eliminate by a caper bush; he heard the Shed coming upon him - he fled, and it tripped on palm roots - the tree dried up and it died.</p></div>
<div class="indent1"><span class="nm">(l)</span><p>That of sorb trees is Sheidi - a sorb tree near the city has at least 60 Shedim.</p></div>
<div class="indent1"><span class="nm">(m)</span><p><span class="cl">Question:</span> What difference does it make?</p></div>
<div class="indent1"><span class="nm">(n)</span><p><span class="cl">Answer:</span> This is useful for writing amulets.</p></div>
<div class="indent1"><span class="nm">(o)</span><p>A watchman [or officer] was by a sorb tree near the city; 60 Shedim entered him, endangering him. He went to a Chacham who did not know that the tree housed 60 Shedim; the Chacham wrote an amulet for one Shed.</p></div>
<div class="indent1"><span class="nm">(p)</span><p>The Shedim hung an instrument on the Chacham and sang 'He dresses like a Chacham, but he does not even know how to bless [on his turban]!'</p></div>
<div class="indent1"><span class="nm">(q)</span><p>A Chacham came who knew that 60 Shedim inhabit it, and wrote an amulet for 60 Shedim; he heard them say 'Clear your wares out of here (let's leave).'</p></div>
<div class="indent1"><span class="nm">(r)</span><p>There are two Shedim called Ketev - one [is found] before noon and one after noon;</p></div>
<div class="indent2"><span class="nm">1.</span><p>The one before noon is called Ketev Meriri, and it appears in jars of Kutach, and revolves on a mixing spoon (Rashi Devarim 32:24 - the name of the Shed is Meriri; Ketev means 'cutting');</p></div>
<div class="indent2"><span class="nm">2.</span><p>The one after noon is called Ketev Yashud Tzaharayim, and it appears in goats' horns, and revolves in a sieve.</p></div>
<div class="indent1"><span class="nm">(s)</span><p>Abaye was walking; Rav Papa was on his right and Rav Huna brei d'Rav Yehoshua was on his left. He saw Ketev Meriri approaching him on his left - he had Rav Papa and Rav Huna switch sides.</p></div>
<div class="indent2"><span class="nm">1.</span><p><span class="cl">Rav Papa:</span> Why aren't you concerned for me?</p></div>
<div class="indent2"><span class="nm">2.</span><p><span class="cl">Abaye:</span> Your Mazel is good now (you are wealthy).</p></div>
<div class="indent1"><span class="nm">(t)</span><p>From the first of Tamuz until the 16th it (Ketev Meriri) is common; afterwards, it is doubtful if it is common; it is found in the shadow of Chatzva (a shrub) less than an Amah tall, and in morning and afternoon shadows less than an Amah, and primarily in the shadow of an outhouse.</p></div>
<div class="subject"><span class="nm">4)</span><p>THINGS ONE SHOULD REFRAIN FROM</p></div>
<div class="indent1"><span class="nm">(a)</span><p><span class="cl">(Rav Yosef):</span> The following three things cause blindness - combing one's hair when it is dry, drinking wine that drips from a barrel, and putting on shoes when his feet are still wet [from bathing].</p></div>
<div class="indent1"><span class="nm">(b)</span><p>Hanging bread [in a basket] in the house makes one prone to poverty - this is like people say, if one is Toleh (hangs) a [bread] basket, his food will be Taluy (suspended; alternatively, he will be dependent on others for food).</p></div>
<div class="indent2"><span class="nm">1.</span><p>This is only regarding bread - it is normal to hang meat and fish, so this is fine.</p></div>
<div class="indent1"><span class="nm">(c)</span><p>Bran and bread crumbs in the house make one prone to poverty - on Shabbos night and Tuesday night Mazikim dwell on them.</p></div>
<div class="indent1"><span class="nm">(d)</span><p>The angel appointed over sustenance is called Nakid (he demands Nekiyus (cleanliness) - he is upset by crumbs on the floor, for they get trampled);</p></div>
<div class="indent2"><span class="nm">1.</span><p>The angel appointed over poverty is called Naval (he comes when people are messy with bread).</p></div>
<div class="indent1"><span class="nm">(e)</span><p>A plate on top of a barrel makes one prone to poverty; drinking water from a plate makes one prone to an eye ailment.</p></div>
