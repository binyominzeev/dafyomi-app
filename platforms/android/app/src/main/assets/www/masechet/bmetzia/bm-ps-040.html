<p class="dedicationbox"><br>PAST DEDICATION<br>BAVA METZIA 38-40 (10 Sivan) - dedicated by Mrs. Rita Grunberger of Queens, N.Y., in loving memory of her husband, Reb Yitzchok Yakov ben Eliyahu Grunberger. Irving Grunberger helped many people quietly in an unassuming manner and is dearly missed by all who knew him. His Yahrzeit is 10 Sivan. </p>

<p class="bas subject"><span class="nm">1)</span>DO WE COMPENSATE ONE WHO MADE IMPROVEMENTS?</p>
<p class="bas indent1"><span class="nm">(a)</span><span class="cl">Objection #1 (Abaye):</span> That is different! There, the adults knew that they have minor brothers, and they improved the property knowing that this will be shared with the minors;</p>
<p class="bas indent2"><span class="nm">1.</span>Mari did not know that he had a brother. He improved for himself!</p>
<p class="bas indent1"><span class="nm">(b)</span><span class="cl">Objection #2 (R. Ami):</span> We learned a bigger Chidush than this. If a relative worked on land of a captive, when the captive returns, he gets the improved land. The relative is paid like a sharecropper. All the more so, Mari (who thought that it is his) gets this much!</p>
<p class="bas indent1"><span class="nm">(c)</span><span class="cl">Answer (Rav Chisda):</span> That is different, for Beis Din appoints relatives over land of captives. Mari did not consult with Beis Din;</p>
<p class="bas indent2"><span class="nm">1.</span>Also, Ploni was a minor. We do not put a relative on the land of a minor! (Rif - this also answers Abaye's question.)</p>
<p class="bas indent2"><span class="nm">2.</span><span class="cl">R. Ami:</span> They did not tell me that Ploni was a minor!</p>
<p class="bas subject"><span class="nm">2)</span>STANDARD LOSS OF <i>PEROS</i></p>
<p class="bas indent1"><span class="nm">(a)</span><span class="cl">(Mishnah):</span> If Reuven deposited Peros with Shimon, when he takes them back, he deducts the normal losses, as follows:</p>
<p class="bas indent2"><span class="nm">1.</span>For wheat or rice, nine half-Kavim per Kor (a Kor is 30 Sa'im, which is 180 Kavim);</p>
<p class="bas indent2"><span class="nm">2.</span>For barley or millet, nine Kavim per Kor;</p>
<p class="bas indent2"><span class="nm">3.</span>For spelt and flax seed, three Sa'im per Kor.</p>
<p class="bas indent1"><span class="nm">(b)</span>The losses are according to the amount of Peros and the season.</p>
<p class="bas indent1"><span class="nm">(c)</span>R. Yochanan ben Nuri says, mice eat the same amount, regardless of how much there is! Rather, he deducts the amount specified for one Kor.</p>
<p class="bas indent1"><span class="nm">(d)</span>R. Yehudah says, if he deposited a large amount, he does not deduct anything, for the Peros expand (enough to compensate for the losses).</p>
<p class="bas indent1"><span class="nm">(e)</span><span class="cl">(Gemara) Question:</span> The losses for rice are more than nine half-Kavim per Kor!</p>
<p class="bas indent1"><span class="nm">(f)</span><span class="cl">Answer (Rabah bar bar Chanah):</span> The Mishnah discusses peeled rice.</p>
<p class="bas indent1"><span class="nm">(g)</span><span class="cl">(Mishnah):</span> For spelt and flax seed - three Sa'im per Kor;</p>
<p class="bas indent1"><span class="nm">(h)</span><span class="cl">(R. Yochanan):</span> The Mishnah discusses flax seed in the stalk (but the seeds themselves would not decrease so much).</p>
<p class="bas indent1"><span class="nm">(i)</span><span class="cl">Support (Beraisa):</span> For unpeeled rice he deducts three Sa'im per Kor.</p>
<p class="bas indent1"><span class="nm">(j)</span><span class="cl">(Mishnah):</span> The losses are according to the amount of Peros.</p>
<p class="bas indent1"><span class="nm">(k)</span><span class="cl">(Beraisa):</span> He deducts these amounts for each Kor, for each year.</p>
<p class="bas indent1"><span class="nm">(l)</span><span class="cl">(Mishnah):</span> R. Yochanan ben Nuri says...</p>
<p class="bas indent1"><span class="nm">(m)</span><span class="cl">(Beraisa - Chachamim):</span> Much of the Peros get lost and scattered.</p>
<p class="bas indent1"><span class="nm">(n)</span><span class="cl">(Beraisa):</span> The Mishnah discusses when Shimon mixed Reuven's Peros with his own. If he left them by themselves, he gives them back to Reuven as they are.</p>
<p class="bas indent1"><span class="nm">(o)</span><span class="cl">Question:</span> When he mixed it, he should return to Reuven the percentage that was his!</p>
<p class="bas indent1"><span class="nm">(p)</span><span class="cl">Answer:</span> Shimon has been taking from the mixture, and we do not know how much he took.</p>
<p class="bas subject"><span class="nm">3)</span>WHEN WE DO NOT DEDUCT</p>
<p class="bas indent1"><span class="nm">(a)</span><span class="cl">(Mishnah - R. Yehudah):</span> If he deposited a large amount...</p>
<p class="bas indent1"><span class="nm">(b)</span><span class="cl">Question:</span> What is considered a large amount?</p>
<p class="bas indent1"><span class="nm">(c)</span><span class="cl">(Rabah bar bar Chanah):</span> It is 10 Korim.</p>
<p class="bas indent2"><span class="nm">1.</span>A Beraisa supports this.</p>
<p class="bas indent1"><span class="nm">(d)</span><span class="cl">(A reciter of Beraisos):</span> The Mishnah discusses one who measured and returned to him from the granary. If he measured from the granary and returned from the house, he does not deduct, for the house measure is smaller.</p>
<p class="bas indent1"><span class="nm">(e)</span><span class="cl">Objection (Rav Nachman):</span> Does the Mishnah discuss fools, who give a large measure and take back a small measure?!</p>
<p class="bas indent1"><span class="nm">(f)</span><span class="cl">Suggestion (Rav Nachman):</span> Perhaps your Beraisa means, the Mishnah is when he measured and returned to him at the time of the granary, but if he measured at the time of the granary (after the Peros dried in the sun) and returned in winter, he does not deduct, for the Peros expand.</p>
<p class="bas indent1"><span class="nm">(g)</span><span class="cl">Question (Rav Papa):</span> If the Peros expand, a barrel that was full in summer should break in winter!</p>
<p class="bas indent1"><span class="nm">(h)</span><span class="cl">Answer #1:</span> Indeed, that once happened.</p>
<p class="bas indent1"><span class="nm">(i)</span><span class="cl">Answer #2:</span> Because the Peros are tightly packed, they do not expand.</p>
<p class="bas subject"><span class="nm">4)</span>LOSSES DUE TO ABSORPTION</p>
<p class="bas indent1"><span class="nm">(a)</span><span class="cl">(Mishnah):</span> One deducts a sixth of the wine deposited;</p>
<p class="bas indent1"><span class="nm">(b)</span>R. Yehudah says, he deducts a fifth.</p>
<p class="bas indent1"><span class="nm">(c)</span>One deducts three Lugim of oil for every 100, one and a half for dregs, and one and a half for absorption (of the barrel).</p>
<p class="bas indent2"><span class="nm">1.</span>If the oil was clear, he does not deduct for dregs. If the barrels had held oil before, he does not deduct for absorption.</p>
<p class="bas indent2"><span class="nm">2.</span>R. Yehudah says, even if one sells clear oil all year round, the buyer must accept one and a half Lugim of (pure) dregs per 100.</p>
<p class="bas indent1"><span class="nm">(d)</span><span class="cl">(Gemara):</span> Chachamim and R. Yehudah do not argue about wine. Each teaches the law for his place.</p>
<p class="bas indent2"><span class="nm">1.</span><span class="cl">Explanation #1:</span> Where the barrels are smeared with wax, they absorb less, so he deducts a sixth. Where they are smeared with Zefes (pitch), they absorb more, so he deducts a fifth.</p>
<p class="bas indent2"><span class="nm">2.</span><span class="cl">Explanation #2:</span> The clay from which the barrels are made affects the absorption. The clay in R. Yehudah's area absorbs more than that in Chachamim's area.</p>
<p class="bas indent1"><span class="nm">(e)</span>In Rav Yehudah's area, there were 48 Kuz in a barrel; the price was six Zuz for a barrel. Rav Yehudah would sell six Kuz for a Zuz.</p>
<p class="bas bbbline">40b---------------------------------------- 40b</p>
<p class="bas indent2"><span class="nm">1.</span>He would get back the six Zuz he paid after selling 36 Kuz of the barrel. Eight Kuz (a sixth) were absorbed in the barrel, his whole profit was four Kuz.</p>
<p class="bas indent2"><span class="nm">2.</span><span class="cl">Question:</span> Shmuel taught, one (who sells life essentials) may not profit more than a sixth! (Rav Yehudah was entitled to take a bigger profit. Why didn't he?!)</p>
<p class="bas indent2"><span class="nm">3.</span><span class="cl">Answer:</span> He would also keep the barrel itself and the dregs (he received 48 Kuz of clear wine and dregs for six Zuz).</p>
<p class="bas indent2"><span class="nm">4.</span><span class="cl">Question:</span> If so, he profited more than a sixth!</p>
<p class="bas indent2"><span class="nm">5.</span><span class="cl">Answer:</span> He was entitled to more for his toil. Also, he needed to pay the merchant who sold his wine (some explain - the one who would open the barrel).</p>
<p class="bas indent1"><span class="nm">(f)</span><span class="cl">(Mishnah):</span> If the oil...(if the barrels had held oil before, he does not deduct for absorption).</p>
<p class="bas indent1"><span class="nm">(g)</span><span class="cl">Question:</span> Even old barrels absorb something!</p>
<p class="bas indent1"><span class="nm">(h)</span><span class="cl">Answer #1 (Rav Nachman):</span> The Mishnah discusses old barrels that were smeared. They do not absorb any more.</p>
<p class="bas indent1"><span class="nm">(i)</span><span class="cl">Answer #2 (Abaye):</span> Even barrels that were not smeared do not absorb any more once they are saturated.</p>
<p class="bas subject"><span class="nm">5)</span>IMPURITIES IN OIL</p>
<p class="bas indent1"><span class="nm">(a)</span><span class="cl">(Mishnah - R. Yehudah):</span> Even if one sells clear oil all year round, the buyer must accept one and a half Lugim of (pure) dregs.</p>
<p class="bas indent1"><span class="nm">(b)</span><span class="cl">Inference (Abaye):</span> R. Yehudah permits mixing dregs, and Chachamim forbid this.</p>
<p class="bas indent2"><span class="nm">1.</span>R. Yehudah obligates a buyer to accept dregs because a seller is allowed to mix them in.</p>
<p class="bas indent1"><span class="nm">(c)</span><span class="cl">Question:</span> The buyer should be able to say 'if they were mixed in, I would have sold the oil with the dregs, but no one will buy pure dregs!' (The buyer must accept dregs even if he cannot mix them with the clear oil, e.g. he already sold or consumed the clear oil.)</p>
<p class="bas indent1"><span class="nm">(d)</span><span class="cl">Answer:</span> The case is, the buyer buys for his own consumption, he prefers clear oil.</p>
<p class="bas indent1"><span class="nm">(e)</span><span class="cl">Question:</span> Why can't the buyer say, since you did not mix in dregs, you waived your right. I will not accept pure dregs!</p>
<p class="bas indent1"><span class="nm">(f)</span><span class="cl">Answer:</span> This is like R. Yehudah holds elsewhere, that we do not say that a person pardons things (unless he explicitly says so);</p>
<p class="bas indent2"><span class="nm">1.</span><span class="cl">(Mishnah):</span> If one sold the yoke, he did not sell the oxen. If one sold the oxen, he did not sell the yoke;</p>
<p class="bas indent2"><span class="nm">2.</span>R. Yehudah says, the money reveals what he sold. If he paid 200 (Zuz) for a yoke, surely this includes the oxen.</p>
<p class="bas indent2"><span class="nm">3.</span>Chachamim say, the money is not a proof (he pardoned the extra money).</p>
<p class="bas indent1"><span class="nm">(g)</span>Chachamim forbid mixing dregs because the buyer did not accept dregs.</p>
<p class="bas indent1"><span class="nm">(h)</span><span class="cl">Question (against Abaye - Rav Papa):</span> Just the contrary! Chachamim permit mixing. The buyer need not accept dregs, because the seller waived his right by not mixing them.</p>
<p class="bas indent2"><span class="nm">1.</span>R. Yehudah forbids mixing. The buyer accepts dregs because the seller was not allowed to mix them in (and he relies on selling the dregs to make a profit).</p>
<p class="bas indent1"><span class="nm">(i)</span><span class="cl">(Beraisa):</span> A buyer and a depositor have the same law regarding Piktim (Rashi - refuse of the pits that floats on top; Aruch - cloudy oil above the dregs).</p>
<p class="bas indent1"><span class="nm">(j)</span><span class="cl">Question:</span> What is their law?</p>
<p class="bas indent2"><span class="nm">1.</span><span class="cl">Suggestion:</span> A depositor need not accept them, just like a buyer need not.</p>
<p class="bas indent2"><span class="nm">2.</span><span class="cl">Rejection:</span> The Shomer can say 'what should I do about them?!'</p>
<p class="bas indent1"><span class="nm">(k)</span><span class="cl">Answer:</span> Rather, just like a depositor must accept them, also a buyer.</p>
<p class="bas indent1"><span class="nm">(l)</span><span class="cl">Version #1 - Question (Beraisa - R. Yehudah):</span> Cloudy oil is a loss to the seller, because the buyer accepts a Log and a half of dregs (Aruch - alone, without the cloudy oil; Rashi - therefore, the oil must be clear).</p>
<p class="bas indent1"><span class="nm">(m)</span><span class="cl">Version #2 (Tosfos) - Question (Beraisa - R. Yehudah):</span> The seller bears the loss when he sells cloudy oil, since the buyer accepts only a Log and a half of dregs when he gets clear oil.(end of Version #2)</p>
<p class="bas indent1"><span class="nm">(n)</span><span class="cl">Answer:</span> If the buyer gave money in Tishrei (according to the low price of Tishrei, when most oil is cloudy) to receive oil in Nisan, he accepts Piktim; if he gives money in Nisan for oil in Nisan (when oil is clear and expensive), he does not accept Piktim.</p>
<p class="bas subject"><span class="nm">6)</span>ONE WHO MOVED THE DEPOSIT</p>
<p class="bas indent1"><span class="nm">(a)</span><span class="cl">(Mishnah):</span> If Reuven deposited a barrel with Shimon, and Reuven did not designate where it should be kept, and Shimon moved it and it broke:</p>
<p class="bas indent2"><span class="nm">1.</span>If it broke while he was holding it, if he picked it for his needs, he is liable. If he picked it up for its needs, he is exempt.</p>
<p class="bas indent2"><span class="nm">2.</span>If it broke after he put it down, whether he picked it up for his needs or for its needs, he is exempt.</p>
<p class="bas indent1"><span class="nm">(b)</span>If Reuven designated where it should be kept, whether it broke while he was holding it or after he put it down, if he picked it up for his needs, he is liable. If it was for its needs, he is exempt.</p>
<p class="bas indent1"><span class="nm">(c)</span><span class="cl">Question:</span> Who is the Tana of the (first part of the) Mishnah (if it broke after he put it down, he is always exempt)?</p>
<p class="bas indent1"><span class="nm">(d)</span><span class="cl">Answer:</span> It is R. Yishmael, who does not obligate telling the owner that his property was returned.</p>
<p class="bas indent2"><span class="nm">1.</span><span class="cl">(Beraisa - R. Yishmael):</span> If one stole a lamb from a flock or a coin from a wallet, he returns it to where he stole it from;</p>
<p class="bas indent2"><span class="nm">2.</span>R. Akiva says, he must inform the owner.</p>
