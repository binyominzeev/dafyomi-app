<p class="bas subject"><span class="nm">1)</span>CONCERN THAT BEIS DIN ERRED</p>
<p class="bas indent1"><span class="nm">(a)</span><span class="cl">(Ravina):</span> If an Odisah did not mention testimony, rather, it used expressions of judges (e.g. 'Zichron Devarim'), but it (had only two signatures, and it) did not say 'we sat like three judges, and one of us died', Reish Lakish's Chazakah applies.</p>
<p class="bas indent1"><span class="nm">(b)</span><span class="cl">Rejection (Rav Noson bar Ami):</span> Rava taught that in such a case we are concerned lest Beis Din erred (i.e. two people thought that they suffice for a Beis Din).</p>
<p class="bas indent1"><span class="nm">(c)</span><span class="cl">(Rav Nachman bar Yitzchak):</span> If it says 'Beis Din', we are not concerned (that they erred).</p>
<p class="bas indent1"><span class="nm">(d)</span><span class="cl">Question:</span> Perhaps it was an impudent Beis Din!</p>
<p class="bas indent2"><span class="nm">1.</span><span class="cl">(Shmuel):</span> If two judged a monetary case, the verdict stands, just it is called an impudent Beis Din.</p>
<p class="bas indent1"><span class="nm">(e)</span><span class="cl">Answer:</span> He means, if it says 'the Beis Din of our Rebbi, Rav Ashi.'</p>
<p class="bas indent1"><span class="nm">(f)</span><span class="cl">Question:</span> Perhaps Rav Ashi's Talmidim hold like Shmuel!</p>
<p class="bas indent1"><span class="nm">(g)</span><span class="cl">Answer:</span> It says 'Rav Ashi told us...'</p>
<p class="bas subject"><span class="nm">2)</span>WHEN IS AN OUTSIDER BELIEVED?</p>
<p class="bas indent1"><span class="nm">(a)</span><span class="cl">(Beraisa):</span> If Reuven told Shimon's orphans 'I saw Shimon hide money in a chest. He said that it was Ploni's or Ma'aser Sheni':</p>
<p class="bas indent2"><span class="nm">1.</span>If the chest is in their house, we ignore his words (one witness is not believed);</p>
<p class="bas indent2"><span class="nm">2.</span>If the chest is in the field, he is believed;</p>
<p class="bas indent2"><span class="nm">3.</span>The general rule is, he is believed only if he could have taken the money himself.</p>
<p class="bas indent1"><span class="nm">(b)</span>If they saw their father hide money in a chest and he said that it was Ploni's or Ma'aser Sheni':</p>
<p class="bas indent2"><span class="nm">1.</span>If this was like a command what do with the money, we fulfill his words;</p>
<p class="bas indent2"><span class="nm">2.</span>If he said this cunningly (so they will not take the money or think that he is rich), we ignore his words.</p>
<p class="bas indent1"><span class="nm">(c)</span><span class="cl">A case occurred:</span> Levi was pained that he did not know where his father left his money, and he was told in a dream 'the amount is such and such, they are in such and such place, they are Ma'aser Sheni - Chachamim ruled that dreams have no bearing (the money is Chulin).</p>
<p class="bas subject"><span class="nm">3)</span>GIVING THE VERDICT</p>
<p class="bas indent1"><span class="nm">(a)</span><span class="cl">(Mishnah):</span> If two decide that he is exempt...</p>
<p class="bas indent1"><span class="nm">(b)</span><span class="cl">Question:</span> How do we write the verdict?</p>
<p class="bas indent1"><span class="nm">(c)</span><span class="cl">Answer #1 (R. Yochanan):</span> We write 'he is exempt.'</p>
<p class="bas indent1"><span class="nm">(d)</span><span class="cl">Answer #2 (Reish Lakish):</span> We write 'David and Moshe are Mezakeh, and Yehudah is Mechayev.'</p>
<p class="bas indent1"><span class="nm">(e)</span><span class="cl">Answer #3 (R. Elazar):</span> We write 'from the judges' words, Ploni is exempt.'</p>
<p class="bas indent1"><span class="nm">(f)</span><span class="cl">Question:</span> What is the difference between these answers?</p>
<p class="bas indent1"><span class="nm">(g)</span><span class="cl">Answer #1:</span> They argue about which judges pay if they erred:</p>
<p class="bas indent2"><span class="nm">1.</span>According to R. Yochanan (we do not know if a judge dissented), so all pay;</p>
<p class="bas indent2"><span class="nm">2.</span>According to Reish Lakish, the dissenting judge does not pay. (Perhaps the Gemara did not discuss according to R. Elazar in the first two answers, for they are rejected, and it is not so clear what he would hold.)</p>
<p class="bas indent1"><span class="nm">(h)</span><span class="cl">Rejection:</span> All should agree that the dissenting judge is exempt. His colleagues erred by not heeding him!</p>
<p class="bas indent1"><span class="nm">(i)</span><span class="cl">Answer #2:</span> Rather, they argue about whether or not the erring judges pay the share of the third.</p>
<p class="bas indent2"><span class="nm">1.</span>According to R. Yochanan they pay his share;</p>
<p class="bas indent2"><span class="nm">2.</span>According to Reish Lakish, they do not.</p>
<p class="bas indent1"><span class="nm">(j)</span><span class="cl">Rejection:</span> All should agree that the erring judges do not pay his share. They could not have judged the case without him!</p>
<p class="bas indent1"><span class="nm">(k)</span><span class="cl">Answer #3:</span> Rather, they argue about "Lo Selech Rachil b'Amecha":</p>
<p class="bas indent2"><span class="nm">1.</span>R. Yochanan says that we do not say who dissented, due to "Lo Selech Rachil";</p>
<p class="bas indent2"><span class="nm">2.</span>Reish Lakish says that we say what each judge said, lest it look like Sheker;</p>
<p class="bas indent2"><span class="nm">3.</span>R. Elazar is concerned for both, therefore the verdict suggests that one dissented without mentioning which.</p>
<p class="bas indent1"><span class="nm">(l)</span><span class="cl">(Mishnah):</span> When they finish deciding, they bring them in...</p>
<p class="bas indent1"><span class="nm">(m)</span><span class="cl">Question:</span> Whom do they bring in?</p>
<p class="bas indent1"><span class="nm">(n)</span><span class="cl">Answer #1:</span> They bring in the litigants.</p>
<p class="bas indent1"><span class="nm">(o)</span><span class="cl">Rejection:</span> They are there the entire time!</p>
<p class="bas indent1"><span class="nm">(p)</span><span class="cl">Answer #2:</span> Rather, they bring in the witnesses.</p>
<p class="bas indent1"><span class="nm">(q)</span><span class="cl">Suggestion:</span> Our Mishnah is unlike R. Noson.</p>
<p class="bas indent2"><span class="nm">1.</span><span class="cl">(Beraisa):</span> Witnesses can testify together only if they saw the testimony together;</p>
<p class="bas indent2"><span class="nm">2.</span>R. Yehoshua ben Korchah says, we can join their testimony even if they saw it one after the other;</p>
<p class="bas indent2"><span class="nm">3.</span>Also, their testimony is invalid unless they testify together in Beis Din;</p>
<p class="bas indent2"><span class="nm">4.</span>R. Noson says, we can accept the testimony of one of them today, and the other will testify when he comes to Beis Din tomorrow. (However,  our Mishnah requires returning the witnesses, so they will be together!)</p>
<p class="bas indent1"><span class="nm">(r)</span><span class="cl">Defense of Answer #1:</span> Really, they bring in the litigants. The Mishnah is R. Nechemyah;</p>
<p class="bas indent2"><span class="nm">1.</span><span class="cl">(Beraisa - R. Nechemyah):</span> Nekiyei ha'Da'as of Yerushalayim used to bring in the litigants and hear their claims, bring in the witnesses and hear their testimony, and tell them to leave while they judged.</p>
<p class="bas indent1"><span class="nm">(s)</span><span class="cl">Question (Beraisa):</span> When they decided, they would bring in the witnesses.</p>
<p class="bas indent1"><span class="nm">(t)</span><span class="cl">Answer:</span> That is not like R. Noson.</p>
<p class="bas subject"><span class="nm">4)</span>WHEN DO TESTIMONIES JOIN?</p>
<p class="bas indent1"><span class="nm">(a)</span><span class="cl">(Beraisa):</span> Witnesses cannot testify together unless they saw the testimony together;</p>
<p class="bas indent1"><span class="nm">(b)</span>R. Yehoshua ben Korchah says, we can join their testimony even if they saw it one after the other.</p>
<p class="bas indent1"><span class="nm">(c)</span><span class="cl">Question:</span> What do they argue about?</p>
<p class="bas indent1"><span class="nm">(d)</span><span class="cl">Answers:</span> The argument is based on reasoning, or a verse.</p>
<p class="bas indent1"><span class="nm">(e)</span><span class="cl">Answer #1:</span> The argument is based on reasoning. The first Tana says, if they did not see the testimony together, perhaps they testify about different loans;</p>
<p class="bas indent2"><span class="nm">1.</span>R. Yehoshua ben Korchah says, in any case, both agree that he owes the money!</p>
<p class="bas indent1"><span class="nm">(f)</span><span class="cl">Answer #2:</span> They argue about a verse, "v'Hu Ed Oh Ra'ah Oh Yada";</p>
<p class="bas indent2"><span class="nm">1.</span><span class="cl">(Beraisa) Question:</span> "Lo Yakum Ed" already implies 'one.' Why did the Torah have to say "Echad"?</p>
<p class="bas indent2"><span class="nm">2.</span><span class="cl">Answer:</span> This teaches that "Ed" always connotes two, unless specified otherwise.</p>
<p class="bas indent3"><span class="nm">i.</span>The Torah uses the singular to discuss two witnesses who saw testimony, to teach that they must see like one (at the same time);</p>
<p class="bas indent3"><span class="nm">ii.</span>R. Yehoshua ben Korchah holds that "v'Hu Ed Oh Ra'ah Oh Yada" includes any way they know testimony (even if they did not see together).</p>
<p class="bas indent1"><span class="nm">(g)</span><span class="cl">(Beraisa):</span> Also, their testimony is invalid unless they testify together in Beis Din;</p>
<p class="bas indent1"><span class="nm">(h)</span>R. Noson says, we can accept the testimony of one of them today, and the other will testify when he comes to Beis Din tomorrow.</p>
<p class="bas indent1"><span class="nm">(i)</span><span class="cl">Question:</span> What do they argue about?</p>
<p class="bas indent1"><span class="nm">(j)</span><span class="cl">Answers:</span> The argument is based on reasoning, or on a verse:</p>
<p class="bas indent1"><span class="nm">(k)</span><span class="cl">Answer #1:</span> The argument is based on reasoning. The first Tana says that one witness comes only to obligate an oath (therefore, he cannot be joined to a witness to obligate paying);</p>
<p class="bas indent2"><span class="nm">1.</span>R. Noson says, in any case (even when they come to Beis Din together), they do not testify at the same moment, yet the Torah obligates money according to two witnesses.</p>
<p class="bas indent1"><span class="nm">(l)</span><span class="cl">Answer #2:</span> They argue about a verse "(Oh Ra'ah...) Im Lo Yagid v'Nosa Avono."</p>
<p class="bas bbbline">30b----------------------------------------30b</p>
<p class="bas indent2"><span class="nm">1.</span>All hold like Chachamim who argue with R. Yehoshua ben Korchah (they must see the testimony together).</p>
<p class="bas indent2"><span class="nm">2.</span>They argue about whether or not we equate testifying (Yagid) to seeing (Ra'ah) the testimony: the first Tana equates them, R. Noson does not.</p>
<p class="bas indent1"><span class="nm">(m)</span>R. Shimon ben Elyakim strove to give Semichah to R. Yosi b'Rebbi Chanina. He was not able.</p>
<p class="bas indent2"><span class="nm">1.</span><span class="cl">R. Yochanan:</span> Does anyone know whether or not the Halachah follows R. Yehoshua ben Korchah?</p>
<p class="bas indent2"><span class="nm">2.</span><span class="cl">R. Shimon ben Elyakim:</span> He (R. Yosi b'Rebbi Chanina) knows.</p>
<p class="bas indent2"><span class="nm">3.</span><span class="cl">R. Yochanan:</span> Let him tell us!</p>
<p class="bas indent2"><span class="nm">4.</span><span class="cl">R. Shimon ben Elyakim:</span> First give to him Semichah.</p>
<p class="bas indent2"><span class="nm">5.</span>R. Yochanan gave to him Semichah.</p>
<p class="bas indent2"><span class="nm">6.</span><span class="cl">R. Yosi b'Rebbi Chanina:</span> I heard that R. Yehoshua ben Korchah holds like R. Noson.</p>
<p class="bas indent2"><span class="nm">7.</span><span class="cl">R. Yochanan:</span> This is obvious! The essence of testimony is seeing it. R. Yehoshua does not require them to see it together, all the more so, they need not say it together!</p>
<p class="bas indent3"><span class="nm">i.</span>In any case, since you received Semichah, you keep it.</p>
<p class="bas indent1"><span class="nm">(n)</span><span class="cl">(R. Zeira):</span> This teaches that once someone receives Semichah, he keeps it.</p>
<p class="bas subject"><span class="nm">5)</span>WHEN DO TESTIMONIES JOIN? (cont.)</p>
<p class="bas indent1"><span class="nm">(a)</span><span class="cl">(R. Chiya bar Avin citing Rav):</span> The Halachah follows R. Yehoshua ben Korchah, both for (testimony about) land and Metaltelim.</p>
<p class="bas indent1"><span class="nm">(b)</span><span class="cl">(Ula):</span> The Halachah follows R. Yehoshua ben Korchah regarding land, but not regarding Metaltelim.</p>
<p class="bas indent1"><span class="nm">(c)</span><span class="cl">Question (Abaye):</span> This implies that there is an argument about land. However, R. Aba taught that Chachamim agree with R. Yehoshua ben Korchah about land!</p>
<p class="bas indent2"><span class="nm">1.</span><span class="cl">(Rav Idi bar Avin):</span> Chachamim agree with R. Yehoshua ben Korchah about testimony about a Bechor, land, Chazakah, and similarly in a boy or girl (this will be explained).</p>
<p class="bas indent1"><span class="nm">(d)</span><span class="cl">Answer:</span> They are Amora'im. R. Chiya bar Aba and Ula argue with them (and say that Chachamim argue about land)!</p>
<p class="bas indent1"><span class="nm">(e)</span><span class="cl">Question:</span> What does it mean 'similarly in a boy or girl'?</p>
<p class="bas indent2"><span class="nm">1.</span><span class="cl">Suggestion:</span> One witness says that he saw one hair (of adulthood) on the front, and one witness says that he saw one on the back.</p>

<p class="bas indent1"><span class="nm">(f)</span><span class="cl">Answer:</span> Rather, one witness says that he saw two hairs on the front, and one witness says that he saw two on the back.</p>
<p class="bas indent1"><span class="nm">(g)</span><span class="cl">(Rav Yosef citing Ula):</span> The Halachah follows R. Yehoshua ben Korchah, both regarding land and Metaltelim;</p>
<p class="bas indent2"><span class="nm">1.</span><span class="cl">(R. Zeira citing Rav):</span> The Halachah follows R. Yehoshua ben Korchah regarding land, but not regarding Metaltelim.</p>
<p class="bas indent2"><span class="nm">2.</span>This is like Rav taught elsewhere.</p>
<p class="bas indent2"><span class="nm">3.</span><span class="cl">(Rav):</span> (Testimony of) different admissions join (Reuven admitted to Shimon 'I owe you' in front of Ploni, and later admitted in front of Almoni);</p>
<p class="bas indent2"><span class="nm">4.</span>(Testimony of) an admission joins (testimony of one witness who saw) a loan <i>before</i> the admission;</p>

<p class="bas indent1"><span class="nm">(h)</span><span class="cl">Question (Rav Nachman bar Yitzchak):</span> What is the difference between different loans and different admissions?</p>
<p class="bas indent2"><span class="nm">1.</span>Different loans do not join, for they do not testify about the same money. Likewise, different admissions should not join, for (perhaps) they are not about the same money!</p>
<p class="bas indent1"><span class="nm">(i)</span><span class="cl">Answer (Rav Huna brei d'Rav Yehoshua):</span> The case is, when Reuven admitted in front of Almoni, he said 'I already admitted about this debt in front of Ploni.'</p>
<p class="bas indent1"><span class="nm">(j)</span><span class="cl">Question:</span> Still, Ploni does not know that he testifies about the same money as Almoni does!</p>
<p class="bas indent1"><span class="nm">(k)</span><span class="cl">Answer:</span> The case is, Reuven later told Ploni 'I admitted in front of Almoni about the debt I admitted to in front of you.'</p>
<p class="bas indent2"><span class="nm">1.</span>Rav Nachman was grateful for the answer. Rav Huna told him that a great difficulty remains.</p>
<p class="bas indent1"><span class="nm">(l)</span><span class="cl">Question (Rava):</span> If so (Reuven must tell each witness that the other witness also knows about this loan), this is just like an admission after a loan! (Also there Reuven must tell the witness on the loan that he later admitted to Almoni. If so, why did Rav consider these to be separate cases?!)</p>
<p class="bas indent2"><span class="nm">1.</span><span class="cl">Rav Nachman:</span> I heard that people of this city give great explanations, then destroy them!</p>
<p class="bas indent1"><span class="nm">(m)</span><span class="cl">(Chachamim of Neharde'a):</span> We join (testimony of) two admissions, two loans, or one of each (in either order).</p>
<p class="bas indent2"><span class="nm">1.</span>This is like R. Yehoshua ben Korchah.</p>
<p class="bas indent1"><span class="nm">(n)</span><span class="cl">(Rav Yehudah):</span> If the witnesses contradicted each other about Bedikos (matters not essential to the testimony), the testimony is valid for monetary cases.</p>
<p class="bas indent1"><span class="nm">(o)</span><span class="cl">(Rava):</span> Presumably, Rav Yehudah refers only to a contradiction such as the color of the wallet, but if they argue about the color of the coins, the testimony is invalid.</p>
<p class="bas indent1"><span class="nm">(p)</span><span class="cl">Question:</span> This implies that a contradiction about the color of the wallet disqualifies testimony for capital cases;</p>
<p class="bas indent2"><span class="nm">1.</span>However,  Rav Chisda taught that if one witness said that Reuven killed with a sword, and the other said that he used an axe, they do not join;</p>
<p class="bas indent2"><span class="nm">2.</span>If one said that his clothes were black, the other said that they were white, the testimonies join.</p>
