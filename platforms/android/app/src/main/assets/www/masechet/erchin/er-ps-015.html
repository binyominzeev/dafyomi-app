<p class="dedicationbox">ERCHIN 15 - Two weeks of study material have been dedicated by Mrs. Estanne Abraham Fawer to honor the twelfth Yahrzeit of her father, Rav Mordechai ben Eliezer Zvi (Rabbi Morton Weiner) Z'L, who passed away on 18 Teves 5760. May the merit of supporting and advancing Dafyomi study -- which was so important to him -- during the weeks of his Yahrzeit serve as an Iluy for his Neshamah. </p>

<p class="bas indent1"><span class="nm">(b)</span><span class="cl">Answer #2 (R. Ze'ira):</span> Rather, people would protest, if two men raped a girl, the first Lo Kedarkah, the second Kedarkah (normal relations), does the latter pay 50, just like one (Rashi; Tosfos - the first man) who raped a proper virgin?!</p>
<p class="bas indent1"><span class="nm">(c)</span><span class="cl">Objection: (Abaye):</span> If so, they should similarly protest, does one pay 30 for a healthy slave, just like for a Muchas Shechin?!</p>
<p class="bas indent1"><span class="nm">(d)</span><span class="cl">Answer #3 (Abaye):</span> (Regarding rape, it says) "Tachas Asher Inah" - the 50 Shekalim are for paining her, implying that there are other payments.

<p class="bas indent1"><span class="nm">(e)</span><span class="cl">Answer #4 (Rava):</span> "V'Nasan ha'Ish ha'Shochev Imah... " teaches that he pays 50 just for the pleasure he had. This implies that there are also other payments.</p>

<p class="bas indent1"><span class="nm">(a)</span><span class="cl">(Mishnah):</span> There are leniencies and stringencies of Motzi Shem Ra (a man who falsely claims that the girl he married was not a virgin):</p>
<p class="bas indent2"><span class="nm">1.</span>Whether he was Motzi Shem Ra on the most prestigious Bas Kohen, or the lowliest Bas Yisrael, he pays 100 Shekalim.</p>
<p class="bas indent1"><span class="nm">(b)</span>We find that the punishment for speech (Motzi Shem Ra) is greater than for an act. (A rapist pays only 50).</p>
<p class="bas indent1"><span class="nm">(c)</span>Likewise, Bnei Yisrael sinned 10 times in the Midbar, the decree that they would not enter Eretz Yisrael was only due to Lashon ha'Ra (of the Meraglim, which Bnei Yisrael heeded) - "va'Yenasu Osi Zeh Eser Pe'amim."</p>
<p class="bas indent1"><span class="nm">(d)</span><span class="cl">(Gemara) Question:</span> How do we know that the greater punishment for Motzi Shem Ra is because he sinned through speech? Perhaps it is because he tried to kill her - "v'Im Emes Hayah ha'Davar... v'Hotzi'u Es ha'Na'arah... " (and she is killed! Normally, we believe his claim. It is unreasonable that a man would seek a pretext to divorce his wife and avoid paying her full Kesuvah immediately after toiling to make a wedding feast! One of the few cases in which we do not believe (and therefore punish) him is if he brings witnesses who testify about her adultery, and they are proven to be false through Hazamah.)</p>

<p class="bas indent1"><span class="nm">(b)</span><span class="cl">Question:</span> How do we know that it was due to Lashon ha'Ra alone? Perhaps this "filled their Se'ah" (completed their guilt to the amount for which they were worthy to be punished)!</p>
<p class="bas indent2"><span class="nm">1.</span><span class="cl">(Rav Hamnuna):</span> "Bi'Melos Sifko Yetzer Lo" - Hash-m does not punish a person until his Se'ah is filled.</p>

<p class="bas indent1"><span class="nm">(d)</span><span class="cl">(Beraisa - R. Eliezer ben Parta):</span> From the Meraglim, we see the magnitude of Lashon ha'Ra:</p>
<p class="bas indent2"><span class="nm">1.</span>They were punished so severely for speaking about wood and stones (Eretz Yisrael). All the more so, one who speaks about people will be punished severely!</p>
<p class="bas indent1"><span class="nm">(e)</span><span class="cl">Objection:</span> Perhaps the Meraglim were punished so severely due to R. Chanina bar Papa's teaching!</p>
<p class="bas indent2"><span class="nm">1.</span><span class="cl">(R.

We explain "Mimenu" to mean "than <i>Him</i>," as if the Master cannot enter His own house! (Shitah Mekubetzes - we read this "mi'Yemino" (than His right hand).)</p>

<p class="bas indent1"><span class="nm">(h)</span>Two were at Keri'as Yam Suf. Before the sea split, they complained "ha'Mibli Ein Kevarim b'Mitzrayim." After they left the sea, they sinned again (they doubted Hash-m's promise that they would not see the Mitzrim again);</p>

<p class="bas indent2"><span class="nm">3.</span>Hash-m told the Sar (angel) of the sea to spit the Mitzriyim onto the dry land.</p>

Surely, if Ploni was there, it was said in a positive way (he is always feeding the poor). Maharal - when speaking in front of the party discussed, the primary transgression is arousing a quarrel. It is not called Lashon ha'Ra.)</p>
