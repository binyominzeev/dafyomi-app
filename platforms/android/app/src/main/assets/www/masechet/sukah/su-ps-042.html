<div class="subject"><span class="nm">1)</span><p>R. YOSI EXEMPTS FROM A CHATAS ONE WHO CARRIES A LULAV</p></div>
<div class="indent1"><span class="nm">(a)</span><p><span class="cl">(Abaye):</span> R. Yosi's exemption applies only prior to fulfilling the Mitzvah.</p></div>
<div class="indent1"><span class="nm">(b)</span><p><span class="cl">Question:</span> But there is never a point of carrying prior to fulfilling the Mitzvah, since one is Yotzei as soon as one picks it up!?</p></div>
<div class="indent1"><span class="nm">(c)</span><p><span class="cl">Answer (Abaye):</span> R. Yosi was speaking where he picked it up upside down.</p></div>
<div class="indent1"><span class="nm">(d)</span><p><span class="cl">Answer (Rava):</span> R. Yosi was speaking where one took the Lulav by means of a Kli.</p></div>
<div class="indent2"><span class="nm">1.</span><p><span class="cl">Question:</span> But Rava holds that indirect Lekichah is called Lekichah!?</p></div>
<div class="indent2"><span class="nm">2.</span><p><span class="cl">Answer:</span> That holds only in a respectable manner (like draping one's hand with a cloth).</p></div>
<div class="subject"><span class="nm">2)</span><p>OTHER EXAMPLES OF R. YOSI'S PETUR FOR TA'AH BI'DEVAR MITZVAH</p></div>
<div class="indent1"><span class="nm">(a)</span><p><span class="cl">(R. Huna):</span> R. Yosi also exempted one who ate an Olah thinking it was a Chatas.</p></div>
<div class="indent2"><span class="nm">1.</span><p><span class="cl">Question:</span> That is not news, that is identical to the Petur of our Mishnah!?</p></div>
<div class="indent2"><span class="nm">2.</span><p><span class="cl">Answer:</span> We might have limited the Petur of Ta'ah bi'Devar Mitzvah to where he is presently fulfilling a Mitzvah (such as Netilas Lulav, but not eating the Olah, which is not a Mitzvah at all).</p></div>
<div class="indent1"><span class="nm">(b)</span><p><span class="cl">Question:</span> But in the Beraisa R. Yosi teaches that one who accidentally slaughters an unchecked Tamid is Chayav!?</p></div>
<div class="indent1"><span class="nm">(c)</span><p><span class="cl">Answer:</span> That is exceptional as it is close to Meizid (as that Beraisa has been qualified as speaking where he negligently took the animal from the unchecked pen).</p></div>

<div class="indent1"><span class="nm">(a)</span><p>A woman may return the Lulav to its water on Shabbos.</p></div>
<div class="indent1"><span class="nm">(b)</span><p><span class="cl">(R. Yehudah):</span> It may be placed back in its water on Shabbos, but no water may be added, while on Yom Tov water may be added and on Chol ha'Moed the water may be changed.</p></div>
<div class="indent1"><span class="nm">(c)</span><p>A boy who knows how to wave the Lulav is obligated.</p></div>
<div class="subject"><span class="nm">4)</span><p>WOMEN AND LULAV</p></div>
<div class="indent1"><span class="nm">(a)</span><p><span class="cl">Question:</span> Is it not obvious that she can handle the Lulav?</p></div>
<div class="indent1"><span class="nm">(b)</span><p><span class="cl">Answer:</span> We might have prohibited her handling of the Lulav since she is not obligated it its waving it might be Muktzeh for her.</p></div>
<div class="subject"><span class="nm">5)</span><p>THE OBLIGATIONS OF A CHILD</p></div>
<div class="indent1"><span class="nm">(a)</span><p>The Beraisa lists the obligation point for Lulav, Tzitzis, Tefilin, Torah and Shema.</p></div>
<div class="indent2"><span class="nm">1.</span><p><span class="cl">Question:</span> What does his father teach him?</p></div>
<div class="indent2"><span class="nm">2.</span><p><span class="cl">Answer:</span> Torah Tzivah and the first Pasuk of Shema.</p></div>
<div class="indent1"><span class="nm">(b)</span><p>The Beraisa lists when a child's body does not render Tum'ah, when his hands do not create Tum'ah.</p></div>

<div class="indent1"><span class="nm">(e)</span><p>If he is able to control the knife, he may slaughter (when he is under adult supervision- R. Huna).</p></div>
<div class="indent1"><span class="nm">(f)</span><p>Once he can eat a k'Zayis of grain his discharges are malodorous and Tefilah must be distanced from them (assuming that he can eat the k'Zayis within Achilas Peras- R. Chisda).</p></div>
<div class="indent1"><span class="nm">(g)</span><p><span class="cl">(R. Chiya bar R. Yeiva):</span> One must distance oneself in prayer from an adult's discharges even if he presently cannot eat a k'Zayis within Achilas Peras (Pasuk).</p></div>
<div class="indent1"><span class="nm">(h)</span><p>Once a child can eat a k'Zayis of roasted meat he is included in the Korban Pesach.</p></div>
