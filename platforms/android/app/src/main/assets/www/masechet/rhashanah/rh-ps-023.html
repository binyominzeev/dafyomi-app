<p class="bas indent1"><span class="nm">(a)</span>Some say there are four types of cedar wood, others say ten (as discussed).</p>
<p class="bas indent1"><span class="nm">(b)</span>Light ships are weighted down, tied to coral, and the weights removed so that the rising ship drags up the coral.</p>
<p class="bas indent1"><span class="nm">(c)</span><span class="cl">(R. Yochanan):</span> Hash-m will eventually return all the beams that the non-Jews took from Yerushalayim, as derived from Pesukim.</p>
<p class="bas indent2"><span class="nm">1.</span>Anyone who learns Torah but does not teach it is like a myrtle in the desert.</p>
<p class="bas indent3"><span class="nm">i.</span><span class="cl">(Others):</span> Anyone who learns Torah and teaches it in a place lacking Torah scholars is like a beloved myrtle in the desert.</p>
<p class="bas indent2"><span class="nm">2.</span>Woe to the non-Jews who have no rectification - who can replace the slaughtered R. Akiva and the others?</p>

<p class="bas subject"><span class="nm">2)</span>THE RELAY STATIONS FOR THE FIRES</p>
<p class="bas indent1"><span class="nm">(a)</span>The last station, Beis Baltin, was Biram; the region of the Diaspora that could see it was Pumbedisa.</p>
<p class="bas indent1"><span class="nm">(b)</span>It looked like a bonfire because everyone was waving torches from the roofs.</p>
<p class="bas indent1"><span class="nm">(c)</span><span class="cl">(R. Shimon ben Elazar):</span> There were also other message relay stations.</p>
<p class="bas indent2"><span class="nm">1.</span>Some say these were between the ones listed earlier.</p>
<p class="bas indent2"><span class="nm">2.</span>Other say they extended further towards Bavel.</p>
<p class="bas indent1"><span class="nm">(d)</span><span class="cl">(R. Yochanan):</span> There were 8 parsa'os between each station, 32 altogether.</p>
<p class="bas indent2"><span class="nm">1.</span><span class="cl">Question:</span> Surely we see nowadays that it is a greater distance?</p>
<p class="bas indent2"><span class="nm">2.</span><span class="cl">Answer:</span> The short paths have become blocked, as we see in Pesukim.</p>
<p class="bas subject"><span class="nm">3)</span><i>MISHNAH:</i> ARRANGEMENTS FOR THE WITNESSES</p>
<p class="bas indent1"><span class="nm">(a)</span><span class="cl">(On Shabbos):</span> The witnesses would go to a courtyard called Beis Ya'azek to be cross-examined by Beis Din.</p>
<p class="bas indent1"><span class="nm">(b)</span>They were served big feasts to encourage them to come.</p>
<p class="bas indent1"><span class="nm">(c)</span>Originally, they couldn't leave there all day (as they were beyond their Techum Shabbos).</p>
<p class="bas indent1"><span class="nm">(d)</span>R. Gamliel decreed that they could travel for 2000 Amos in each direction.</p>
<p class="bas indent1"><span class="nm">(e)</span>This was also applied to a midwife, and people escaping fire, invading soldiers, flooding, and collapsed buildings.</p>
<p class="bas subject"><span class="nm">4)</span>THE ETYMOLOGY OF <i>BEIS YA'AZEK</i></p>
<p class="bas indent1"><span class="nm">(a)</span><span class="cl">Question:</span> Was it called Beis Ya'azek (which simply means encircled by a wall) or Beis Yazek (which has the unpleasant meaning of being chained down)?</p>
<p class="bas indent1"><span class="nm">(b)</span><span class="cl">Answer:</span> We see that there were big feasts served there, so it wasn't an unpleasant experience!</p>
<p class="bas indent1"><span class="nm">(c)</span><span class="cl">Refutation:</span> Being well fed is not a contradiction to being unpleasantly chained down.</p>
<p class="bas subject"><span class="nm">5)</span><i>MISHNAH:</i> CROSS-EXAMINING THE WITNESSES</p>
<p class="bas indent1"><span class="nm">(a)</span>The first group of witnesses to arrive would be examined first.</p>
<p class="bas indent1"><span class="nm">(b)</span>They would call in the older one and ask him:</p>
<p class="bas indent2"><span class="nm">1.</span>Was the moon travelling in front of the sun or behind it?</p>
<p class="bas indent2"><span class="nm">2.</span>Was it north of the sun or south of it?</p>
<p class="bas indent2"><span class="nm">3.</span>How high up was it?</p>
<p class="bas indent2"><span class="nm">4.</span>Which way was it facing?</p>
<p class="bas indent2"><span class="nm">5.</span>How wide was it?</p>
<p class="bas indent2"><span class="nm">6.</span>If he said that it was in front of the sun, his testimony is worthless.</p>
<p class="bas indent1"><span class="nm">(c)</span>Then they would call in the second witness and examine him.</p>
<p class="bas indent1"><span class="nm">(d)</span>If the testimonies matched, they would ask basic questions to all the other witnesses.</p>
<p class="bas indent2"><span class="nm">1.</span>This was so as not to discourage them from coming in the future.</p>
<p class="bas subject"><span class="nm">6)</span>THE MOON FACING THE SUN</p>
<p class="bas indent1"><span class="nm">(a)</span><span class="cl">Question:</span> Aren't the questions about the moon being in front of the sun and north of the sun identical?</p>
<p class="bas indent1"><span class="nm">(b)</span><span class="cl">Answer:</span> The first question is whether the concave side was facing the sun.</p>
<p class="bas indent2"><span class="nm">1.</span>If he says that it was, his testimony is worthless.</p>
<p class="bas indent3"><span class="nm">i.</span>R. Yochanan derives from a Pasuk that the sun never faces the concave side of the moon (which would embarrass it) or of a rainbow (which would lead people to think that the sun is shooting arrows at those who deny its power).</p>
