<p class="bas subject"><span class="nm">1)</span>WOOL OF A <i>BECHOR</i></p>
<p class="bas indent1"><span class="nm">(a)</span><span class="cl">Question (against Reish Lakish - Beraisa):</span> If one detached wool of a Tam (unblemished Bechor), even if it later developed a Mum and was slaughtered, the wool is forbidden.</p>
<p class="bas indent2"><span class="nm">1.</span><span class="cl">Inference:</span> Wool detached from a Ba'al Mum is permitted, even if it was not shown to an expert!</p>
<p class="bas indent1"><span class="nm">(b)</span><span class="cl">Answer:</span> No, the Tana uses "Tam" to refer to any animal not permitted by an expert, even if it has a Mum.</p>
<p class="bas indent1"><span class="nm">(c)</span><span class="cl">Suggestion:</span> Tana'im argue about Reish Lakish's law:</p>
<p class="bas indent2"><span class="nm">1.</span><span class="cl">(Beraisa):</span> If one detached wool of a Tam (Rashi - or it became detached), even if the animal later developed a Mum and was slaughtered, the wool is forbidden;</p>
<p class="bas indent2"><span class="nm">2.</span>Akavya ben Mahalal'el says, if wool was detached from a Bechor Ba'al Mum and it died (without Shechitah), the wool is permitted;</p>
<p class="bas indent2"><span class="nm">3.</span>Chachamim forbid it.</p>
<p class="bas indent2"><span class="nm">4.</span><span class="cl">R. Yehudah:</span> Akavya does not permit in this case!</p>
<p class="bas indent3"><span class="nm">i.</span>Rather, if wool fell off a Bechor Ba'al Mum and was put in the window, and the animal was slaughtered, Akavya permits and Chachamim forbid.</p>
<p class="bas indent2"><span class="nm">5.</span><span class="cl">R. Yosi:</span> My father Chalifta was one of the Chachamim who argued with Akavya. He agreed that it is permitted after Shechitah;</p>
<p class="bas indent3"><span class="nm">i.</span>Chachamim said that the wool should be put in the window, for it might become permitted - if the animal will be slaughtered, all permit it;</p>
<p class="bas indent3"><span class="nm">ii.</span>If it dies, Akavya permits, Chachamim forbid.</p>
<p class="bas indent2"><span class="nm">6.</span><span class="cl">Question:</span> R. Yosi is just like the first Tana!</p>
<p class="bas indent3"><span class="nm">i.</span><span class="cl">Suggestion:</span> They argue about whether an expert must permit the animal first - the first Tana permits the wool only if it came off after an expert saw the Mum, R. Yosi (said that in any case it might become permitted, he) does not distinguish whether or not an expert saw the Mum.</p>
<p class="bas indent1"><span class="nm">(d)</span><span class="cl">Rejection (Rava):</span> No, all agree that an expert must permit the animal first; there is a three-way argument:</p>
<p class="bas indent2"><span class="nm">1.</span>The first Tana (explicitly) says that they argue when it died - he holds that they also argue about when it was slaughtered;</p>
<p class="bas indent2"><span class="nm">2.</span>R. Yehudah says that they argue when it was slaughtered, but all forbid when it died;</p>
<p class="bas indent2"><span class="nm">3.</span>R. Yosi says that they argue when it died, but all permit when it was slaughtered.</p>
<p class="bas indent1"><span class="nm">(e)</span><span class="cl">(Rav Nachman):</span> The Halachah (i.e. the proper understanding of the argument of Chachamim and Akavya) follows R. Yehudah, because the Mishnah in Eduyos is like him. (The Halachah follows every Mishnah in Eduyos.)</p>
<p class="bas indent2"><span class="nm">1.</span><span class="cl">(Mishnah):</span> If hair of a Bechor Ba'al Mum fell out and was put in the window, and then it was slaughtered, Akavya ben Mahalal'el permits the hair;</p>
<p class="bas indent2"><span class="nm">2.</span>Chachamim forbid it.</p>
<p class="bas indent1"><span class="nm">(f)</span><span class="cl">Support (Rav Nachman bar Yitzchak):</span> The Seifa of our Mishnah also shows that the Halachah follows R. Yehudah!</p>
<p class="bas indent2"><span class="nm">1.</span><span class="cl">(Seifa):</span> If dangling wool of a Bechor is Nir'eh with the attached wool, it is permitted; if it sticks out, it is forbidden.</p>
<p class="bas indent2"><span class="nm">2.</span><span class="cl">Question:</span> Like which Tana is this?</p>
<p class="bas indent2"><span class="nm">3.</span><span class="cl">Answer #1:</span> It is like R. Yosi.</p>
<p class="bas indent2"><span class="nm">4.</span><span class="cl">Question:</span> What is the case?</p>
<p class="bas indent3"><span class="nm">i.</span>It was not slaughtered, for then Akavya and Chachamim both permit the hair!</p>
<p class="bas indent2"><span class="nm">5.</span><span class="cl">Answer:</span> It died.</p>
<p class="bas indent3"><span class="nm">i.</span>This is unlike Chachamim, for they forbid the hair whether or not it is dangling!</p>
<p class="bas indent3"><span class="nm">ii.</span>This is unlike Akavya, for he would sooner forbid what is Nir'eh with the attached hair (along with the attached hair, which becomes forbidden at death) than the hair which stands out!</p>
<p class="bas indent2"><span class="nm">6.</span>(Answer #1 is rejected.)</p>
<p class="bas indent2"><span class="nm">7.</span><span class="cl">Answer #2:</span> It is like R. Yehudah.</p>
<p class="bas indent2"><span class="nm">8.</span><span class="cl">Question:</span> What is the case?</p>
<p class="bas indent3"><span class="nm">i.</span>It did not die, for then Akavya and Chachamim both forbid the hair!</p>
<p class="bas indent2"><span class="nm">9.</span><span class="cl">Answer:</span> It was slaughtered.</p>
<p class="bas indent3"><span class="nm">i.</span>This is unlike Akavya, for he permits the hair whether or not it is dangling!</p>
<p class="bas indent3"><span class="nm">ii.</span>It is like Chachamim.</p>
<p class="bas indent2"><span class="nm">10.</span><span class="cl">Conclusion:</span> They argue about when it was slaughtered (like R. Yehudah).</p>
<p class="bas indent1"><span class="nm">(g)</span><span class="cl">Question (R. Zeira):</span> If one was Tolesh (detached) wool from a Tam Olah, what is the law (after it is slaughtered)?</p>
<p class="bas indent1"><span class="nm">(h)</span><span class="cl">Objection:</span> (This is forbidden,) surely, he may not benefit from the wool (Rashi - according to Chachamim)!</p>
<p class="bas indent1"><span class="nm">(i)</span><span class="cl">Correction:</span> Rather, if wool was Nitlash (became detached) from a Tam Olah, what is the law?</p>
<p class="bas indent2"><span class="nm">1.</span>We do not ask about Chatas and Asham - since they are brought for atonement, surely one would not delay bringing them (there is no need to decree to forbid the wool)!</p>
<p class="bas indent2"><span class="nm">2.</span>We do not ask about Bechor and Ma'aser - since they are not brought for atonement, surely (we forbid the wool) lest one delay bringing them!</p>
<p class="bas indent2"><span class="nm">3.</span>The question is only about Olah:</p>
<p class="bas bbbline">26b----------------------------------------26b</p>
<p class="bas indent3"><span class="nm">i.</span>Since it is not primarily for atonement, we are concerned lest one delay bringing them, the wool is forbidden;</p>
<p class="bas indent3"><span class="nm">ii.</span>Or, since it does atone for (Bitul of a) Mitzvas Aseh (or Lav ha'Nitak l'Aseh), one would not delay them, the wool is permitted!</p>
<p class="bas indent1"><span class="nm">(j)</span><span class="cl">Answer (Beraisa):</span> If one was Tolesh wool of a Tam, even if it later developed a Mum and was slaughtered, the wool is forbidden.</p>
<p class="bas indent1"><span class="nm">(k)</span><span class="cl">Inference:</span> It is forbidden because he was Tolesh - but Nitlash would be permitted;</p>
<p class="bas indent2"><span class="nm">1.</span>All the more so, if wool of an Olah (which people are less prone to delay bringing) was Nitlash, it is permitted!</p>
<p class="bas indent1"><span class="nm">(l)</span><span class="cl">Rejection:</span> No, even Nitlash is forbidden;</p>
<p class="bas indent2"><span class="nm">1.</span>The Beraisa discusses Tolesh to teach the extremity of Akavya, he permits even when one was Tolesh a Ba'al Mum.</p>
<p class="bas indent1"><span class="nm">(m)</span><span class="cl">Question:</span> In our Mishnah he permits only Nashar (what fell out by itself)!</p>
<p class="bas indent1"><span class="nm">(n)</span><span class="cl">Answer:</span> Our Tana discusses Nashar to teach the extremity of Chachamim (they forbid even this), the Tana of the Beraisa discusses Tolesh to teach the extremity of Akavya.</p>
<p class="bas subject"><span class="nm">2)</span>DANGLING WOOL</p>
<p class="bas indent1"><span class="nm">(a)</span><span class="cl">(Mishnah):</span> Dangling wool...</p>
<p class="bas indent1"><span class="nm">(b)</span><span class="cl">Question:</span> What is considered not Nir'eh with the attached wool?</p>
<p class="bas indent1"><span class="nm">(c)</span><span class="cl">Answer #1 (Reish Lakish):</span> The roots face (outwards,) where the ends of the hairs should be (Rashi - the ends also face out; Rambam - and the ends face the skin, where the roots should be);</p>
<p class="bas indent1"><span class="nm">(d)</span><span class="cl">Answer #2 (Rav Nasan bar Oshaya):</span> It protrudes from the attached wool.</p>
<p class="bas indent1"><span class="nm">(e)</span><span class="cl">Question:</span> Why didn't Reish Lakish say like Rav Nasan?</p>
<p class="bas indent1"><span class="nm">(f)</span><span class="cl">Answer (R. Elazar):</span> Reish Lakish holds that since shearings always have strands sticking out, if they are forbidden, no shearings will ever be permitted!</p>

<p class="bas subject"><span class="nm">3)</span><i>BECHOR</i> IS NOT GIVEN IMMEDIATELY</p>
<p class="bas indent1"><span class="nm">(a)</span><span class="cl">(Mishnah) Question:</span> How long must a Yisrael take care of a Bechor before giving it to a Kohen?</p>
<p class="bas indent1"><span class="nm">(b)</span><span class="cl">Answer #1:</span> He must take care of a Seh for 30 days, and a calf for 50 days.</p>
<p class="bas indent1"><span class="nm">(c)</span><span class="cl">Answer #2 (R. Yosi):</span> He must take care of a Seh for three months.</p>
<p class="bas indent1"><span class="nm">(d)</span>If a Kohen asked for the Bechor within this time, he (the Yisrael) may not give it (until the proper time);</p>
<p class="bas indent2"><span class="nm">1.</span>If it had a Mum and a Kohen asked for it to eat it, he may give it (immediately).</p>
<p class="bas indent2"><span class="nm">2.</span>When the Mikdash stands, if a Kohen asks for the Bechor in order to offer it, he may give it.</p>
<p class="bas indent1"><span class="nm">(e)</span>A Bechor should be eaten within its (first) year, whether it is Tam or a Ba'al Mum - "Lifnei Hash-m Elokecha Sochalenu Shanah v'Shanah."</p>
<p class="bas indent1"><span class="nm">(f)</span>If it developed a Mum within its year, he may keep it all 12 months;</p>
<p class="bas indent1"><span class="nm">(g)</span>After its year, he may keep it only for 30 days.</p>
<p class="bas indent1"><span class="nm">(h)</span><span class="cl">(Gemara) Question:</span> What is the source of this?</p>
<p class="bas indent1"><span class="nm">(i)</span><span class="cl">Answer (Rav Kahana):</span> "Bechor Banecha Titen Li; Ken Ta'aseh... l'Tzonecha." (Pidyon ha'Ben is after 30 days. The same applies to giving a Bechor Seh to a Kohen.) "Mele'ascha v'Dim'acha Lo Se'acher... Ken Ta'aseh l'Shorcha." (A Bechor calf is given after 50 days, just like Bikurim may be brought (on Shavu'os) 50 days after they ripen - Rashi; Tosfos Yom Tov - it takes 50 days for Bikurim to fully ripen.)</p>
<p class="bas indent1"><span class="nm">(j)</span><span class="cl">Question:</span> Perhaps we should learn oppositely (a calf from Pidyon ha'Ben, and a Seh from Bikurim)!</p>
<p class="bas indent1"><span class="nm">(k)</span><span class="cl">Answer #1:</span> Bikurim is written before Pidyon ha'Ben, so we learn from it a calf, which is written before Seh.</p>
<p class="bas indent1"><span class="nm">(l)</span><span class="cl">Objection:</span> Just the contrary! We should learn a calf from Pidyon ha'Ben, for they are adjacent!</p>
<p class="bas indent1"><span class="nm">(m)</span><span class="cl">Answer #2 (Rava):</span> "Ken <i>Ta'aseh</i> l'Shorcha" is extra. It alludes to extra time before giving a calf.</p>
<p class="bas indent1"><span class="nm">(n)</span><span class="cl">Question:</span> We should say that it is kept an extra 30 days!</p>
<p class="bas indent1"><span class="nm">(o)</span><span class="cl">Answer:</span> The Torah authorized Chachamim to teach the amount. (Shitah Mekubetzes - a calf needs its mother for 50 days.)</p>
<p class="bas indent1"><span class="nm">(p)</span><span class="cl">Support (Beraisa):</span> "Bechor Banecha Titen Li; Ken Ta'aseh... l'Tzonecha."</p>
<p class="bas indent2"><span class="nm">1.</span><span class="cl">Suggestion:</span> Perhaps the same applies to "Shorcha"!</p>
<p class="bas indent2"><span class="nm">2.</span><span class="cl">Rejection:</span> "Ta'aseh" teaches that extra time is given for a calf. The Torah authorized Chachamim to fix the amount.</p>
<p class="bas indent2"><span class="nm">3.</span><span class="cl">Question:</span> How long must a Yisrael take care of a Bechor before giving it to a Kohen?</p>
<p class="bas indent2"><span class="nm">4.</span><span class="cl">Answer #1:</span> He must take care of a Seh for 30 days, and a calf for 50 days.</p>
<p class="bas indent2"><span class="nm">5.</span><span class="cl">Answer #2 (R. Yosi):</span> He must take care of a Seh for three months. It needs more time because its teeth are fine. (Since it cannot eat grass, it must nurse. Even if the Kohen has a nursing mother Seh, perhaps it will not want to nurse others' babies.)</p>
<p class="bas subject"><span class="nm">4)</span><i>KOHANIM</i> HELPING IN THE GRANARY</p>
<p class="bas indent1"><span class="nm">(a)</span><span class="cl">(Mishnah):</span> If a Kohen asked for the Bechor within this time, the Yisrael may not give it.</p>
<p class="bas indent1"><span class="nm">(b)</span><span class="cl">Question:</span> What is the reason?</p>
<p class="bas indent1"><span class="nm">(c)</span><span class="cl">Answer (Rav Sheshes):</span> (The Yisrael is obligated to care for it. If the Kohen takes it early, he exempts the Yisrael of this burden, and) it looks like a Kohen helping in the granary (in order to receive Terumah).</p>
<p class="bas indent1"><span class="nm">(d)</span><span class="cl">(Beraisa):</span> If Kohanim, Leviyim or poor people help in the pen, granary or slaughterhouse (in order to receive Matanos), we do not give to them Terumah or Ma'aser (Rishon or Oni), nor Bechoros, foreleg, jaw and stomach;</p>
<p class="bas indent2"><span class="nm">1.</span>If one gave to them, he profaned the gifts. It says "Shichatem Bris ha'Levi," and "v'Es Kodshei Venei Yisrael Lo Sechalelu v'Lo Samusu."</p>
<p class="bas indent2"><span class="nm">2.</span><span class="cl">Question:</span> Why is the second verse needed?</p>
<p class="bas indent2"><span class="nm">3.</span><span class="cl">Answer:</span> Without it, we would not know that he is (Tosfos - almost) Chayav Misah (b'Yedei Shamayim) for this.</p>
<p class="bas indent1"><span class="nm">(e)</span>Chachamim wanted to fine a Yisrael who did so, and require him to give (the full amount of produce l'Shem) Terumah (to another Kohen).</p>
<p class="bas indent1"><span class="nm">(f)</span><span class="cl">Question:</span> Why was no such fine made?</p>
<p class="bas indent1"><span class="nm">(g)</span><span class="cl">Answer:</span> If a Yisrael heard that he must gave more Terumah, he might think that the first Terumah was invalid (and that his produce is Tevel);</p>
<p class="bas indent2"><span class="nm">1.</span>Perhaps he will designate it to be Terumah to exempt other Tevel! (Really, it is Chulin, so it cannot become Terumah.)</p>
