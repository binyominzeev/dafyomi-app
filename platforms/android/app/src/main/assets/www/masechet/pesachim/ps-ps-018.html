<div class="subject"><span class="nm">1)</span><p>WHAT ARE LIQUIDS METAMEI?</p></div>
<div class="indent1"><span class="nm">(a)</span><p><span class="cl">Answer (Rav Nachman bar Yitzchak - Mishnah):</span> (Mei Chatas, i.e. water mixed with ashes of the Parah Adumah, is an Av ha'Tum'ah.) If a cow drank Mei Chatas [and it was still in its stomach when it was slaughtered], the meat is Tamei;</p></div>
<div class="indent2"><span class="nm">1.</span><p>R. Yehudah says, the Mei Chatas is Batel in its stomach [because it cannot be used to Metaher].</p></div>
<div class="indent2"><span class="nm">2.</span><p>If he retracted only regarding Kelim, why is the Mei Chatas Batel - granted, it lost severe Tum'ah (it is no longer an Av), but it should retain light Tum'ah [of liquids, from having 'touched' itself when it was an Av, and Metamei the meat]!</p></div>
<div class="indent1"><span class="nm">(b)</span><p><span class="cl">Rejection:</span> Perhaps it is Batel only regarding severe Tum'ah, but it retains light Tum'ah!</p></div>
<div class="indent1"><span class="nm">(c)</span><p><span class="cl">Question:</span> This would imply that the first Tana says that it retains severe Tum'ah - if so, why is he Metamei only the meat [the water can Metamei even people and Kelim]!</p></div>
<div class="indent1"><span class="nm">(d)</span><p><span class="cl">Answer #1:</span> The entire Mishnah is R. Yehudah - it is abbreviated, it means as follows:</p></div>
<div class="indent2"><span class="nm">1.</span><p>If a cow drank Mei Chatas, the meat is Tamei;</p></div>
<div class="indent2"><span class="nm">2.</span><p>The Mei Chatas has only light Tum'ah, but not severe Tum'ah, for R. Yehudah says that it is Batel in its stomach.</p></div>
<div class="indent1"><span class="nm">(e)</span><p><span class="cl">Answer #2 (Rav Ashi):</span> The Mei Chatas is totally Batel, for it is a spoiled liquid (no one would drink it after the cow did).</p></div>
<div class="indent1"><span class="nm">(f)</span><p><span class="cl">(Beraisa - R. Yosi and R. Shimon):</span> Kelim [that doubtfully became Temei'im through liquids] are Tehorim; food [that doubtfully became Tamei through liquids] is Tamei.</p></div>
<div class="indent1"><span class="nm">(g)</span><p><span class="cl">(Rabah bar bar Chanah):</span> R. Yosi holds like his Rebbi, R. Akiva, who expounds "Yitma" like 'Yetamei':</p></div>
<div class="indent2"><span class="nm">1.</span><p><span class="cl">(Mishnah):</span> On that day [that R. Elazar ben Azaryah was appointed Nasi], R. Akiva expounded "V'Chol Keli Cheres Asher Yipol Mehem [El Tocho (if a Sheretz falls into an earthenware oven) Kol Asher b'Socho] Yitma" - It does not say 'Tamei', rather "Yitma" [which can be read 'Yetamei'], to show that a loaf [that was inside,] which is a Sheni makes a Shelishi [even] regarding Chulin.</p></div>
<div class="indent1"><span class="nm">(h)</span><p><span class="cl">Question:</span> How does R. Yosi expound here?</p></div>
<div class="indent1"><span class="nm">(i)</span><p><span class="cl">Answer:</span> It says "V'Chol Mashkeh Asher Yishaseh b'Chol Keli Yitma" - the liquid Yetamei (is Metamei) food.</p></div>
<div class="indent2"><span class="nm">1.</span><p><span class="cl">Suggestion:</span> Perhaps it is Metamei liquids!</p></div>
<div class="indent2"><span class="nm">2.</span><p><span class="cl">Rejection #1:</span> This is not so.</p></div>
<div class="indent2"><span class="nm">3.</span><p><span class="cl">Question:</span> What does this mean?</p></div>
<div class="indent2"><span class="nm">4.</span><p><span class="cl">Answer (Rav Papa):</span> We do not find Tum'ah (food or drink) that is Metamei like itself (Rashi - like we shall expound on Amud B; Tosfos - like we expounded above (14A)).</p></div>
<div class="indent2"><span class="nm">5.</span><p><span class="cl">Rejection #2 (Ravina):</span> The verse shows that it is not Metamei liquids - if it was, the Torah would not have written "Yitma" twice, regarding food and regarding liquids [since both Metamei liquids] - it would have written them together - 'Mi'Kol ha'Ochel...v'Chol Mashkeh...Yitma';</p></div>
<div class="indent3"><span class="nm">i.</span><p>Rather, it says "Yitma" twice because [they are different,] food is Metamei liquids and liquids are Metamei food.</p></div>
<div class="indent1"><span class="nm">(j)</span><p><span class="cl">Question:</span> Perhaps liquids are Metamei Kelim!</p></div>
<div class="indent1"><span class="nm">(k)</span><p><span class="cl">Answer:</span> A Kal va'Chomer disproves this - Kelim are Metamei liquids, but they are not Metamei Kelim (Daf 20 A-B) - all the more so, a liquid that received its Tum'ah from a Keli cannot Metamei Kelim!</p></div>
<div class="indent1"><span class="nm">(l)</span><p><span class="cl">Question:</span> Perhaps a liquid Nitma through a Keli cannot Metamei Kelim, but a liquid Nitma through a Sheretz can!</p></div>
<div class="indent1"><span class="nm">(m)</span><p><span class="cl">Answer:</span> The Torah does not [explicitly] write about a liquid Nitma through a Sheretz - we only learn it from a Kal va'Chomer:</p></div>
<div class="bbbline">18b----------------------------------------18b</p></div>
<div class="indent2"><span class="nm">1.</span><p>A liquid Nitma through a Keli (a Rishon) is Metamei liquids - all the more so, a liquid Nitma through a Sheretz (an Av) is Metamei liquids!</p></div>
<div class="indent2"><span class="nm">2.</span><p>Dayo (it suffices) to learn from a Kal va'Chomer all stringencies found in the source [but we cannot learn more].</p></div>
<div class="indent1"><span class="nm">(n)</span><p><span class="cl">Question:</span> What do we learn from "Yitma" regarding food?</p></div>
<div class="indent1"><span class="nm">(o)</span><p><span class="cl">Answer:</span> "Mi'Kol ha'Ochel Asher Ye'achel...Yitma" - a food Yetamei (is Metamei) liquids.</p></div>
<div class="indent2"><span class="nm">1.</span><p><span class="cl">Suggestion:</span> Perhaps it is Metamei Kelim!</p></div>
<div class="indent2"><span class="nm">2.</span><p><span class="cl">Rejection:</span> A Kal va'Chomer disproves this - liquids are Metamei food, but they are not Metamei Kelim - all the more so, a food that received its Tum'ah from a liquid cannot Metamei Kelim!</p></div>
<div class="indent3"><span class="nm">i.</span><p>Therefore, Yitma teaches that food can Metamei liquids, which are prone to become Tamei (this will be explained).</p></div>
<div class="indent1"><span class="nm">(p)</span><p><span class="cl">Question:</span> Why do we need to say that it is Metamei liquids because they are prone to become Tamei - there is nothing else it could teach about (it cannot Metamei food like itself)!</p></div>
<div class="indent1"><span class="nm">(q)</span><p><span class="cl">Answer:</span> One might have thought that since food is stringent, i.e. it can Metamei liquids (Tosfos R. Peretz - which were not Huchshar), it can also Metamei Kelim - we rebut this, this is not because food have a potent Tum'ah, rather, because liquids are prone to become Tamei.</p></div>
<div class="indent1"><span class="nm">(r)</span><p><span class="cl">Question:</span> Why are liquids considered prone to become Tamei?</p></div>
<div class="indent1"><span class="nm">(s)</span><p><span class="cl">Answer:</span> They are Mekabel Tum'ah without Hechsher.</p></div>
<div class="subject"><span class="nm">2)</span><p>THINGS ARE NOT METAMEI LIKE THEMSELVES</p></div>
<div class="indent1"><span class="nm">(a)</span><p>The Torah wrote "Yitma" [as opposed to Yetamei] to teach that it does not Metamei [some things, e.g. another liquid] like itself.</p></div>
<div class="indent1"><span class="nm">(b)</span><p><span class="cl">Question:</span> We learn this from another source!</p></div>
<div class="indent2"><span class="nm">1.</span><p>"V'Chi Yutan Mayim Al Zera v'Nofal mi'Nivlasam Alav Tamei <i>Hu</i>" - it is Tamei, but it is not Metamei like itself.</p></div>
<div class="indent1"><span class="nm">(c)</span><p><span class="cl">Answer:</span> That teaches about [food, and the same applies to] liquids that became Tamei through a Sheretz, and "Yitma" teaches about liquids that became Tamei through a Keli - both of them are needed:</p></div>
<div class="indent2"><span class="nm">1.</span><p>Had it taught only about liquids that became Tamei through a Keli, one might have thought that liquids that became Tamei through a Sheretz, which are more severe, make Tum'ah like themselves. (And had it only taught about liquids that became Tamei through a Sheretz, we would not know that liquids that became Tamei through a Keli can Metamei at all:)</p></div>
<div class="indent2"><span class="nm">2.</span><p><span class="note"><span>Note:</span> Tzlach did not understand this. Due to Dayo, liquids that became Tamei through a Sheretz cannot be more severe than liquids that became Tamei through a Kli! Beis She'arim (YD 415) answers that Tosfos (DH Dayo) proved that the latter are a Sheni l'Tum'ah, but the former are a Rishon l'Tum'ah, so they could  have this additional stringency.</span></p></div>
<div class="indent1"><span class="nm">(d)</span><p><span class="cl">Question:</span> The Torah should have taught about liquids that became Tamei through a Sheretz - we would know that all the more so, liquids that became Tamei through a Keli do not Metamei like themselves!</p></div>
<div class="indent1"><span class="nm">(e)</span><p><span class="cl">Answer:</span> A verse teaches this even though we could have learned from a Kal va'Chomer.</p></div>
<div class="indent1"><span class="nm">(f)</span><p><span class="cl">Question (Ravina):</span> But Rava taught that R. Yosi does not hold like R. Akiva [who says that Chulin can become a Shelishi], and R. Akiva does not hold like [the following Kal va'Chomer of] R. Yosi! (If R. Yosi expounds Yitma like 'Yetamei', he must agree that Chulin can become a Shelishi!)</p></div>
<div class="indent1"><span class="nm">(g)</span><p><span class="cl">Answer (Rav Ashi):</span> R. Yosi said that R. Akiva [who holds that Tum'ah of liquid is mid'Oraisa] should expound "Yitma" like 'Yetamei', but R. Yosi himself argues.</p></div>
<div class="subject"><span class="nm">3)</span><p>HOW MANY DEGREES OF TUM'AH ARE THERE?</p></div>
<div class="indent1"><span class="nm">(a)</span><p><span class="cl">Question (Rav Ashi):</span> I understand that R. Yosi does not hold like R. Akiva:</p></div>
<div class="indent2"><span class="nm">1.</span><p><span class="cl">(Beraisa - R. Yosi):</span> We learn that Kodesh can become a Revi'i from a Kal va'Chomer.</p></div>
<div class="indent2"><span class="nm">2.</span><p>A Mechusar Kipurim (a Zav, Zavah, Yoledes or Metzora who has completed all steps of the Taharah process except for bringing Korbanos) may eat Terumah, but he is Posel Kodesh - a Shelishi is forbidden regarding Terumah (if Terumah is a Shelishi, it is forbidden), all the more so it is Posel Kodesh (makes a Revi'i)!</p></div>
<div class="indent2"><span class="nm">3.</span><p>The following verse teaches that Kodesh can become a Shelishi; the above Kal va'Chomer teaches that it can become a Revi'i;</p></div>
<div class="indent3"><span class="nm">i.</span><p>"Veha'Basar Asher Yiga b'Chol Tamei Lo Ye'achel" - even if it touched a Sheni [Kodshim becomes a Shelishi].</p></div>
<div class="indent2"><span class="nm">4.</span><p>If R. Yosi held like R. Akiva, he would Posel a Revi'i of Terumah and a Chamishi of Kodesh! (A Tevul Yom may eat Chulin, but he is Posel Terumah - a Shelishi is Pasul regarding Chulin, all the more so it is Posel Terumah! We would then say that a Mechusar Kipurim may eat Terumah, but he is Posel Kodesh - a Revi'i is forbidden regarding Terumah, all the more so it is Posel Kodesh (makes a Chamishi!)</p></div>
