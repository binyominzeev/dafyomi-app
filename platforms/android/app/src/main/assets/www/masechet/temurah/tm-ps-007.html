<p class="bas subject"><span class="nm">1)</span>THE <i>LAVIM</i> THAT PERTAIN TO A <i>BA'AL MUM</i></p>
<p class="bas indent1"><span class="nm">(a)</span><span class="cl">Version #1 (Beraisa - R. Yosi b'Rebbi Yehudah):</span> He transgresses even for Kabalah.</p>
<p class="bas indent1"><span class="nm">(b)</span><span class="cl">Question:</span> What is his reason?</p>
<p class="bas indent1"><span class="nm">(c)</span><span class="cl">Answer #1:</span> "U'Ma'uch v'Chasus... (<i>Lo Sakrivu</i>)" forbids Kabalah.</p>
<p class="bas indent2"><span class="nm">1.</span>The first Tana learns Zerikah from "Lo Sakrivu".</p>
<p class="bas indent2"><span class="nm">2.</span><span class="cl">Question:</span> Above, the Beraisa learned this from "Al ha'Mizbe'ach"!</p>
<p class="bas indent2"><span class="nm">3.</span><span class="cl">Answer:</span> Really, it is learned from "Lo Sakrivu." It is normal to say "Al ha'Mizbe'ach", so we do not expound a law from it.</p>
<p class="bas indent2"><span class="nm">4.</span><span class="cl">Question:</span> R. Yosi should agree that it is normal to say "Al ha'Mizbe'ach." If so, what is his source for Zerikah?</p>
<p class="bas indent1"><span class="nm">(d)</span><span class="cl">Answer #2:</span> Rather, R. Yosi learns Kabalah from "umi'Yad Ben Nechar <i>Lo Sakrivu</i>".</p>
<p class="bas indent1"><span class="nm">(e)</span><span class="cl">Question:</span> How do Chachamim expound this?</p>
<p class="bas indent1"><span class="nm">(f)</span><span class="cl">Answer:</span> It is needed to forbid offering a Ba'al Mum of a Nochri;</p>
<p class="bas indent2"><span class="nm">1.</span>One might have thought since Nochrim may offer a Ba'al Mum as long as it is not lacking a limb, we may offer it on our Mizbe'ach. The verse teaches that this is not so. It is permitted only on their own Bamos.</p>
<p class="bas indent1"><span class="nm">(g)</span><span class="cl">Version #2 (Beraisa - R. Yosi b'Rebbi Yehudah):</span> He transgresses even for Kabalah.</p>
<p class="bas indent1"><span class="nm">(h)</span><span class="cl">Question:</span> What is his reason?</p>
<p class="bas indent1"><span class="nm">(i)</span><span class="cl">Answer #1:</span> "U'Ma'uch v'Chasus... (<i>Lo Sakrivu</i>)" forbids Kabalah.</p>
<p class="bas indent2"><span class="nm">1.</span>He learns Zerikah from "Al ha'Mizbe'ach".</p>
<p class="bas indent2"><span class="nm">2.</span><span class="cl">Question:</span> Also the first Tana should learn Zerikah from "Al ha'Mizbe'ach"!</p>
<p class="bas indent2"><span class="nm">3.</span><span class="cl">Answer:</span> Indeed, he does!</p>
<p class="bas indent2"><span class="nm">4.</span><span class="cl">Question:</span> How does he expound "Lo Sakrivu" (in the verse "u'Ma'uch v'Chasus")?</p>
<p class="bas indent2"><span class="nm">5.</span><span class="cl">Answer:</span> This forbids Zerikah on a Bamas Yachid.</p>
<p class="bas indent2"><span class="nm">6.</span><span class="cl">Question:</span> R. Yosi should also need "Lo Sakrivu" to forbid Zerikah on a Bamas Yachid!</p>
<p class="bas indent2"><span class="nm">7.</span><span class="cl">Answer:</span> Indeed, he does.</p>
<p class="bas indent1"><span class="nm">(j)</span><span class="cl">Question:</span> (We retracted from Answer #1, so Question (h) returns.) What is his source for Kabalah?</p>
<p class="bas indent1"><span class="nm">(k)</span><span class="cl">Answer #2:</span> He learns from "umi'Yad Ben Nechar Lo Sakrivu".</p>
<p class="bas indent1"><span class="nm">(l)</span>Chachamim use this to forbid offering a Ba'al Mum of a Nochri;</p>
<p class="bas indent2"><span class="nm">1.</span>One might have thought that since Mechusar Ever is the only Mum forbidden to Nochrim, we may take other Ba'alei Mumim from Nochrim and offer them. The verse teaches that this is not so. (end of Version #2)</p>
<p class="bas indent1"><span class="nm">(m)</span><span class="cl">Question (Reish Lakish):</span> Perhaps one transgresses (Rashi - for making Hekdesh; Tosfos - for Zerikah and Haktarah of) a Ba'al Mum only if it was born Tam, but not if it was born blemished, for that is like a date tree! (It was never a potential Korban.)</p>
<p class="bas indent1"><span class="nm">(n)</span><span class="cl">Answer (R. Chiya bar Yosef):</span> The Torah forbids "Saru'a (one limb of a pair is bigger than its counterpart) v'Kalut (its hooves are not cloven)," even though these are from birth.</p>
<p class="bas indent1"><span class="nm">(o)</span><span class="cl">Question (Reish Lakish):</span> Perhaps one transgresses only if they were Hukdash through Temurah!</p>
<p class="bas indent2"><span class="nm">1.</span><span class="cl">(Mishnah):</span> A stringency of Temurah not found in regular Kodshim is that Temurah gives Kedushas ha'Guf to a Ba'al Mum Kavu'a (it has a permanent blemish).</p>
<p class="bas indent1"><span class="nm">(p)</span><span class="cl">Answer (R. Yochanan):</span> R. Yanai taught that they voted and concluded that one who is Makdish (and offers) a Ba'al Mum transgresses five Lavim;</p>
<p class="bas indent2"><span class="nm">1.</span>If one transgresses only through Temurah, there is a sixth Lav, i.e. Temurah! (R. Yochanan answered from this teaching, and not from the Beraisa, because it connotes that they were meticulous to find all Lavim.)</p>
<p class="bas indent1"><span class="nm">(q)</span><span class="cl">Question (Reish Lakish):</span> If it was not Hukdash through Temurah, why is one lashed? It is like a date tree!</p>
<p class="bas indent1"><span class="nm">(r)</span><span class="cl">Version #1 - Answer (R. Yochanan):</span> If one is Makdish a tree, it is no disgrace to be Makdish a date tree. If one is Makdish an animal, it is a disgrace to be Makdish a Ba'al Mum instead of a Tam. Therefore, he is lashed.</p>
<p class="bas indent1"><span class="nm">(s)</span><span class="cl">Version #2 - Answer (R. Yochanan):</span> Both of these are a disgrace;</p>
<p class="bas indent2"><span class="nm">1.</span>One who is Makdish a date tree is not lashed, for the entire species is not Kosher for Korbanos. If one is Makdish a Ba'al Mum, he is lashed, since Tamim are Kosher for Korbanos.</p>
<p class="bas subject"><span class="nm">2)</span>OTHER FORMS OF <i>HEKDESH</i></p>
<p class="bas indent1"><span class="nm">(a)</span><span class="cl">(Rava):</span> Since we say that one is lashed because it is a disgrace to be Makdish a Ba'al Mum, he is lashed even if he was Makdish it to sell it and buy Nesachim (the Minchah and wine offered with a Korban).</p>
<p class="bas indent1"><span class="nm">(b)</span>Tana'im argue about Rava's law. (We adopt the text of Shitah Mekubetzes);</p>
<p class="bas indent2"><span class="nm">1.</span><span class="cl">(Beraisa):</span> "Nedavah Ta'aseh Oso" (permits to be Makdish a Ba'al Mum) to Bedek ha'Bayis;</p>
<p class="bas bbbline">7b----------------------------------------7b</p>
<p class="bas indent2"><span class="nm">2.</span><span class="cl">Question:</span> This teaches about Nedavah ("this is Hekdesh Bedek ha'Bayis"). What is the source that one may (and should) fulfill a Neder ("I will give to Bedek ha'Bayis") with a Ba'al Mum?</p>
<p class="bas indent2"><span class="nm">3.</span><span class="cl">Answer #1:</span> "Ul'Neder" (the next word in the verse) includes this.</p>
<p class="bas indent2"><span class="nm">4.</span><span class="cl">Suggestion:</span> Perhaps (one may be Makdish a Ba'al Mum) even for (a Neder to bring) Kodshei Mizbe'ach!</p>
<p class="bas indent2"><span class="nm">5.</span><span class="cl">Rejection:</span> "Ul'Neder Lo Yeratzeh" forbids.</p>
<p class="bas indent2"><span class="nm">6.</span><span class="cl">Question:</span> This forbids (to be Makdish a Ba'al Mum) only for a Neder of Kodshei Mizbe'ach. What is the source to forbid to be Makdish a Ba'al Mum for a Nedavah (for the Mizbe'ach)?</p>
<p class="bas indent2"><span class="nm">7.</span><span class="cl">Answer:</span> "Nedavah" (in the beginning of the verse applies also to the end, "ul'Neder Lo Yeratzeh").</p>
<p class="bas indent2"><span class="nm">8.</span>Rebbi says, "Lo Yeratzeh" refers to something that is itself offered (on the Mizbe'ach).</p>
<p class="bas indent2"><span class="nm">9.</span><span class="cl">Question:</span> Rebbi is just like the first Tana!</p>
<p class="bas indent2"><span class="nm">10.</span><span class="cl">Answer:</span> They argue about Rava's law. The first Tana obligates even for something Hukdash to sell it and buy Nesachim, and Rebbi obligates only for Hekdesh of something that it itself will be offered.</p>
<p class="bas indent1"><span class="nm">(c)</span><span class="cl">Question:</span> What do we learn from "Oso"?</p>
<p class="bas indent1"><span class="nm">(d)</span><span class="cl">Answer (Beraisa):</span> "Nedavah Ta'aseh <i>Oso</i>" permits to be Makdish a Ba'al Mum to Bedek ha'Bayis, but not a Tam;</p>
<p class="bas indent2"><span class="nm">1.</span>This teaches that one who is Makdish a Tam to Bedek ha'Bayis transgresses an Aseh.</p>
<p class="bas indent2"><span class="nm">2.</span><span class="cl">Question:</span> What is the source that he transgresses a Lav?</p>
<p class="bas indent2"><span class="nm">3.</span><span class="cl">Answer (R. Yehudah):</span> "Va'Yedaber Hash-m El Moshe Leimor" teaches that there is a Lav for making it Hekdesh.</p>
<p class="bas indent1"><span class="nm">(e)</span><span class="cl">Question (Rebbi):</span> How do we learn this from the verse?</p>
<p class="bas indent1"><span class="nm">(f)</span><span class="cl">Answer #1 (Bar Kapara):</span> We read "Leimor" like 'Lo Ne'emar' (a Lav was said) about thee matters.</p>
<p class="bas indent1"><span class="nm">(g)</span><span class="cl">Answer #2 (Bei Rav):</span> We read it like 'Lav Amur'.</p>
<p class="bas subject"><span class="nm">3)</span>LAV SHEBI'CHLALOS</p>
<p class="bas indent1"><span class="nm">(a)</span><span class="cl">(Rava):</span> One who offers limbs of a Ba'al Mum on the Mizbe'ach is lashed for total Haktarah and partial Haktarah.</p>
<p class="bas indent1"><span class="nm">(b)</span><span class="cl">(Abaye):</span> One is not lashed (more than once) for Lav shebi'Chlalos (multiple Lavim that are learned from one verse).</p>
<p class="bas indent1"><span class="nm">(c)</span><span class="cl">Question (Beraisa):</span> One who is Makdish (and offers) a Ba'al Mum transgresses five Lavim. (It counts total Haktarah and partial Haktarah like two!)</p>
<p class="bas indent1"><span class="nm">(d)</span><span class="cl">Answer (Abaye):</span> We must substitute Kabalah in place of partial Haktarah.</p>
<p class="bas indent1"><span class="nm">(e)</span><span class="cl">Question:</span> The first Tana said that there are five Lavim. He is not Mechayev for Kabalah. Only R. Yosi b'Rebbi Yehudah is!</p>
<p class="bas indent1"><span class="nm">(f)</span><span class="cl">Version #1:</span> This is left difficult.</p>
<p class="bas indent1"><span class="nm">(g)</span><span class="cl">Version #2:</span> The latter Tana is R. Yosi b'Rebbi Yehudah, so he cannot be the first Tana. Abaye is refuted.</p>
<p class="bas subject"><span class="nm">4)</span>OWNERSHIP OF A <i>BECHOR</i></p>
<p class="bas indent1"><span class="nm">(a)</span><span class="cl">(Mishnah):</span> Kohanim can make Temurah in their Korbanos. (It is forbidden. The Mishnah teaches that if they made Temurah, it takes effect.) Yisrael can make Temurah in their Korbanos;</p>
<p class="bas indent1"><span class="nm">(b)</span>Kohanim cannot make Temurah in Chatas or Asham (given to them to be offered) or Bechor.</p>
<p class="bas indent1"><span class="nm">(c)</span><span class="cl">Question (R. Yochanan ben Nuri):</span> Why can't they make Temurah in Bechor?</p>
<p class="bas indent1"><span class="nm">(d)</span><span class="cl">Answer (R. Akiva):</span> Bechor is Matanos Kehunah, just like Chatas and Asham;</p>
<p class="bas indent2"><span class="nm">1.</span>Just like they cannot make Temurah in Chatas or Asham, they cannot make Temurah in Bechor.</p>
<p class="bas indent1"><span class="nm">(e)</span><span class="cl">Question (R. Yochanan ben Nuri):</span> We cannot learn from Chatas and Asham. Kohanim cannot make Temurah from them, for they acquire them only after Hakravah. They acquire Bechor while it is alive!</p>
<p class="bas indent1"><span class="nm">(f)</span><span class="cl">Answer (R. Akiva):</span> "V'Hayah Hu u'Semuraso Yihyeh Kodesh" teaches that just like (initial) Kedushah takes effect in the owner's premises, also Temurah (takes effect only in the premises of the one who made the initial Hekdesh).</p>
<p class="bas indent1"><span class="nm">(g)</span><span class="cl">(Gemara - Mishnah):</span> A Bechor Tam may be sold alive. A Bechor Ba'al Mum may be sold alive or slaughtered.</p>
<p class="bas indent1"><span class="nm">(h)</span><span class="cl">(Rav Nachman):</span> This is only nowadays (after the Churban), because the Kohen acquires it while it is alive;</p>
<p class="bas indent2"><span class="nm">1.</span>When the Mikdash stands, since a Tam must be offered, a Tam may not be sold alive.</p>
<p class="bas indent1"><span class="nm">(i)</span><span class="cl">Question (Rava - Mishnah):</span> A Bechor Tam may be sold alive.</p>
<p class="bas indent2"><span class="nm">1.</span><span class="cl">Inference:</span> It may not be sold slaughtered.</p>
<p class="bas indent2"><span class="nm">2.</span><span class="cl">Question:</span> When does this apply?</p>
<p class="bas indent3"><span class="nm">i.</span>It cannot be nowadays. Nowadays we may not slaughter a Tam!</p>
<p class="bas indent2"><span class="nm">3.</span><span class="cl">Answer:</span> It must be when the Mikdash stands!</p>
<p class="bas indent1"><span class="nm">(j)</span><span class="cl">Answer:</span> The Mishnah does not explicitly forbid selling a slaughtered Bechor. (Rava inferred this, in order to prove that it discusses when the Mikdash stands);</p>
<p class="bas indent2"><span class="nm">1.</span>Rather, it teaches that a Tam may be sold even nowadays. (One might have thought that it cannot, for the Kohen cannot benefit from it until it gets a Mum, so it is as if he does not own it yet.)</p>
