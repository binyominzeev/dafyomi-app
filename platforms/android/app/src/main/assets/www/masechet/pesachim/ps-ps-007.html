<p class="dedicationbox">12TH CYCLE DEDICATIONS:<BR>&nbsp;<BR>PESACHIM 6-10 - Two weeks of study material have been dedicated by Mrs. Estanne Abraham Fawer to honor the sixth Yahrzeit of her father, Reb Mordechai ben Eliezer Zvi (Rebbi Morton Weiner) Z'L, who passed away 18 Teves 5760. May the merit of supporting and advancing Dafyomi study, which was so important to him, during the weeks of his Yahrzeit serve as an Iluy for his Neshamah. </p>

<div class="subject"><span class="nm">1)</span><p>WHEN IS BITUL POSSIBLE?</p></div>
<div class="indent1"><span class="nm">(a)</span><p><span class="cl">Question:</span> He can Mevatel it during the sixth hour [when Chametz becomes forbidden - he will not forget]!</p></div>
<div class="indent1"><span class="nm">(b)</span><p><span class="cl">Answer:</span> Since it is forbidden mid'Rabanan then, it is as if it is forbidden mid'Oraisa, it is not considered his, so he cannot Mevatel it:</p></div>
<div class="indent2"><span class="nm">1.</span><p><span class="cl">(Rav Gidal):</span> If one was Mekadesh with wheat of Kordenisa [on Erev Pesach] after the (Rashi - start of; Tosfos - end of) sixth hour, we are not concerned for the Kidushin. (Kidushin is according to Chachamim - they forbade all benefit from the wheat!)</p></div>
<div class="indent1"><span class="nm">(c)</span><p><span class="cl">Question:</span> Even after it is forbidden one can Mevatel!</p></div>
<div class="indent2"><span class="nm">1.</span><p><span class="cl">(Beraisa):</span> If one was sitting in a Beis Medrash and remembered that he has Chametz in his house, it suffices to Mevatel it in his heart; the law is the same for Shabbos or Yom Tov.</p></div>
<div class="indent2"><span class="nm">2.</span><p>Granted, we could say that Shabbos refers to the 14th, before Chametz is forbidden - but Yom Tov is always after it is forbidden!</p></div>
<div class="indent1"><span class="nm">(d)</span><p><span class="cl">Answer (Rav Acha bar Yakov):</span> The case is, a Talmid in front of his Rebbi (it would be disrespectful for him to leave) remembered that he has a dough in his house and fears that it <i>will</i> become Chametz - he is Mevatel before it becomes Chametz.</p></div>
<div class="indent1"><span class="nm">(e)</span><p><span class="cl">Support:</span> It says that he was sitting in a Beis Medrash [but otherwise he would be obligated to destroy it or bake it before it ferments - if it discussed Chametz after it is forbidden, Bitul fulfils Tashbisu as well as any other method]!</p></div>
<div class="subject"><span class="nm">2)</span><p>DOUBTFUL CHAMETZ</p></div>
<div class="indent1"><span class="nm">(a)</span><p><span class="cl">(Rabah bar Rav Huna):</span> If moldy bread was found, if Matzah had already become greater [than the amount of Chametz used in that place], it is permitted.</p></div>
<div class="indent1"><span class="nm">(b)</span><p><span class="cl">Question:</span> What is the case?</p></div>
<div class="indent2"><span class="nm">1.</span><p>If he knows that it is Chametz, a majority of Matzah does not permit it!</p></div>
<div class="indent1"><span class="nm">(c)</span><p><span class="cl">Answer:</span> He is unsure if it is Chametz or Matzah.</p></div>
<div class="indent1"><span class="nm">(d)</span><p><span class="cl">Question:</span> Even without a majority of Matzah, we should assume that it is the last thing used there!</p></div>
<div class="indent2"><span class="nm">1.</span><p><span class="cl">(Mishnah):</span> If coins were found [in Yerushalayim] in front of people that sell animals, we always assume that they are coins of Ma'aser Sheni (most animals bought are for Shelamim, from Ma'aser money);</p></div>
<div class="indent2"><span class="nm">2.</span><p>Coins found in Har ha'Bayis are assumed to be Chulin;</p></div>
<div class="indent2"><span class="nm">3.</span><p>In [other places in] Yerushalayim - during the festivals, they are Ma'aser; any other time, they are Chulin.</p></div>
<div class="indent2"><span class="nm">4.</span><p><span class="cl">(R. Shemayah ben Zeira):</span> This is because the markets of Yerushalayim are swept daily (surely they were dropped the day they are found; Har ha'Bayis is not swept, so we follow the majority usage).</p></div>
<div class="indent2"><span class="nm">5.</span><p>This shows that we assume that previous coins were removed, and what is here is recent - the same should apply regarding Safek Chametz (from the start of Pesach, only Matzah was used, we should assume that it is Matzah)!</p></div>
<div class="indent1"><span class="nm">(e)</span><p><span class="cl">Answer #1:</span> Since the bread is moldy, surely it is old.</p></div>
<div class="indent1"><span class="nm">(f)</span><p><span class="cl">Objection:</span> If the mold proves that it is old, it should be forbidden even if the majority was Matzah!</p></div>
<div class="indent1"><span class="nm">(g)</span><p><span class="cl">Answer #2 (Rabah):</span> Rabah bar Rav Huna means, if the days of Matzah (Pesach) had already become many [so it is reasonable that Matzah from the beginning of Pesach would be moldy by now], it is permitted (R. Chananel - after Pesach).</p></div>
<div class="indent1"><span class="nm">(h)</span><p><span class="cl">Objection:</span> If it is reasonable that it became moldy from the beginning of Pesach, this is obvious (surely we assume that it is the most recent bread (Matzah), especially since he did Bedikah to get rid of all Chametz)!</p></div>
<div class="indent1"><span class="nm">(i)</span><p><span class="cl">Answer:</span> The case is, it is very moldy - one might have thought that this shows that it is definitely Chametz - Rabah bar Rav Huna teaches that this is not so, since many days of Matzah have passed, it is reasonable that warm (freshly baked) Matzah was placed on top of a Matzah [from the first day or Erev Pesach] and made it become very moldy.</p></div>
<div class="indent1"><span class="nm">(j)</span><p><span class="cl">Question:</span> We do not follow the last thing used!</p></div>
<div class="indent2"><span class="nm">1.</span><p><span class="cl">(Beraisa - R. Yosi b'Rebbi Yehudah):</span> If a box was used for Chulin and Ma'aser money:</p></div>
<div class="indent3"><span class="nm">i.</span><p>If it is used mostly for Chulin, we assume that money inside is Chulin; if it is used mostly for Ma'aser, we assume that money inside is Ma'aser.</p></div>
<div class="indent2"><span class="nm">2.</span><p>We do not follow the last thing used!</p></div>
<div class="indent1"><span class="nm">(k)</span><p><span class="cl">Answer #1 (Rav Nachman bar Yitzchak):</span> The case is, we do not know which was used last.</p></div>
<div class="indent1"><span class="nm">(l)</span><p><span class="cl">Answer #2 (Rav Zevid):</span> The case is, piles of Chulin and Ma'aser were put in it [in the same day].</p></div>
<div class="indent1"><span class="nm">(m)</span><p><span class="cl">Answer #3 (Rav Papa):</span> The case is, money was found in a crevice (perhaps it is from a while ago, it was not used before because it was not noticed).</p></div>
<div class="subject"><span class="nm">3)</span><p>BLESSING BEFORE MITZVOS</p></div>
<div class="indent1"><span class="nm">(a)</span><p><span class="cl">(Rav Yehudah):</span> One who checks must bless.</p></div>
<div class="indent1"><span class="nm">(b)</span><p><span class="cl">Question:</span> What Berachah does he make?</p></div>
<div class="indent1"><span class="nm">(c)</span><p><span class="cl">Answer #1 (Rav Papi citing Rava):</span> He blesses '[Baruch Atah...Asher Kideshanu b'Mitzvosav v'Tzivanu] Leva'er (to get rid of) Chametz';</p></div>
<div class="indent1"><span class="nm">(d)</span><p><span class="cl">Answer #2 (Rav Papa citing Rava):</span> He blesses 'Al Bi'ur Chametz'.</p></div>
<div class="indent2"><span class="nm">1.</span><p>All agree that Leva'er connotes [to get rid of in] the future - they argue about Al Bi'ur:</p></div>
<div class="bbbline">7b----------------------------------------7b</p></div>
<div class="indent2"><span class="nm">2.</span><p>Rav Papi [does not use this phrase because he] holds that it connotes the past; Rav Papa holds that it connotes the future.</p></div>
<div class="indent1"><span class="nm">(e)</span><p><span class="cl">Question (Beraisa):</span> One who circumcises blesses '...v'Tzivanu Al ha'Milah' (this shows that it connotes the future)!</p></div>
<div class="indent1"><span class="nm">(f)</span><p><span class="cl">Answer:</span> There, one cannot bless 'Lamul', for this implies that he himself must circumcise - but really, someone else could circumcise!</p></div>
<div class="indent2"><span class="nm">1.</span><p><span class="cl">Question:</span> When a father circumcises his son, he should bless 'Lamul' (it is his Mitzvah)!</p></div>
<div class="indent2"><span class="nm">2.</span><p><span class="cl">Answer:</span> Indeed, Rav Papi would say that when a father circumcises, he blesses 'Lamul'!</p></div>
<div class="indent1"><span class="nm">(g)</span><p><span class="cl">Question (Beraisa):</span> [One who slaughters blesses] '...v'Tzivanu Al ha'Shechitah'!</p></div>
<div class="indent1"><span class="nm">(h)</span><p><span class="cl">Answer:</span> There, one cannot bless 'Lishchot', for this implies that he himself must slaughter, and this is not true.</p></div>
<div class="indent2"><span class="nm">1.</span><p><span class="cl">Question:</span> One who slaughters his Korban Pesach should bless 'Lishchot' (it is his Mitzvah)!</p></div>
<div class="indent2"><span class="nm">2.</span><p><span class="cl">Answer:</span> Indeed, Rav Papi would say to bless 'Lishchot' in such a case!</p></div>
<div class="indent1"><span class="nm">(i)</span><p><span class="cl">Question (Beraisa):</span> One who makes a Lulav [bundle on Erev Yom Tov, i.e. ties the myrtle and willow branches to it] for himself blesses Shehecheyanu; when he takes it (the four species) to fulfil the Mitzvah, he blesses 'v'Tzivanu Al Netilas Lulav'.</p></div>
<div class="indent1"><span class="nm">(j)</span><p><span class="cl">Answer:</span> There the past tense is appropriate, for he already fulfilled the Mitzvah the moment he picked them up!</p></div>
<div class="indent1"><span class="nm">(k)</span><p><span class="cl">Question:</span> If so, why does it say 'when he takes it <i>to fulfil</i> the Mitzvah' - it should say, <i>after</i> he fulfilled the Mitzvah!</p></div>
<div class="indent1"><span class="nm">(l)</span><p><span class="cl">Answer:</span> Indeed, it should say this - rather, it says 'to fulfil' for consistency with the Seifa:</p></div>
<div class="indent2"><span class="nm">1.</span><p><span class="cl">(Seifa):</span> One who makes a Sukah for himself blesses Shehecheyanu; when he enters to dwell in it, he blesses 'v'Tzivanu Leshev ba'Sukah'.</p></div>
<div class="indent1"><span class="nm">(m)</span><p>The Halachah is, we bless 'Al Bi'ur Chametz'.</p></div>
<div class="indent1"><span class="nm">(n)</span><p><span class="cl">Question:</span> All agree that we bless before the Mitzvah - what is the source of this?</p></div>
<div class="indent1"><span class="nm">(o)</span><p><span class="cl">Answer:</span> They learned from Rav Yehudah, who taught that on all Mitzvos we bless Over (before) doing them.</p></div>
<div class="indent2"><span class="nm">1.</span><p><span class="cl">Question:</span> How do we know that 'Over' means before?</p></div>
<div class="indent2"><span class="nm">2.</span><p><span class="cl">Answer #1 (Rav Nachman bar Yitzchak):</span> "Va'Yaratz Achima'atz va'Ya'avor Es ha'Kushi."</p></div>
<div class="indent2"><span class="nm">3.</span><p><span class="cl">Answer #2 (Abaye):</span> "V'Hu Avar Lifneihem."</p></div>
<div class="indent2"><span class="nm">4.</span><p><span class="cl">Answer #3:</span> "Va'Ya'avor Malkam Lifneihem va'Shem b'Rosham."</p></div>
<div class="indent1"><span class="nm">(p)</span><p><span class="cl">(Bei Rav):</span> The only exceptions are immersion and Shofar.</p></div>
<div class="indent1"><span class="nm">(q)</span><p><span class="cl">Objection:</span> We understand why we bless on immersion afterwards - beforehand, the person is not ready; (Rashi - this refers to a Ba'al Keri (one who had a seminal emission), he may not say words of Kedushah before immersing. Tosfos - it refers to a convert, but a Ba'al Keri may bless beforehand. Alternatively, we decree that everyone bless afterwards on behalf of converts; alternatively, everyone blesses afterwards, lest they bless and then get afraid and not immerse.)</p></div>
<div class="indent2"><span class="nm">1.</span><p>But why don't we bless on Shofar beforehand?</p></div>
<div class="indent2"><span class="nm">2.</span><p><span class="cl">Suggestion:</span> Perhaps we are concerned lest it will not be sounded properly.</p></div>
<div class="indent2"><span class="nm">3.</span><p><span class="cl">Rejection:</span> If so, likewise we should not bless on slaughter or circumcision!</p></div>
<div class="indent1"><span class="nm">(r)</span><p><span class="cl">Correction (Rav Chisda):</span> Rather, it was taught that the only exception is immersion.</p></div>
<div class="subject"><span class="nm">4)</span><p>WHY WE USE A NER TO CHECK</p></div>
<div class="indent1"><span class="nm">(a)</span><p><span class="cl">(Mishnah):</span> We check by light of a Ner.</p></div>
<div class="indent1"><span class="nm">(b)</span><p><span class="cl">Question:</span> What is the source of this?</p></div>
<div class="indent1"><span class="nm">(c)</span><p><span class="cl">Answer (Rav Chisda):</span> A 'chain' teaches that a Ner is appropriate [for "Lo Yimatzei"] - we learn Metzi'ah-Metzi'ah (finding), Metzi'ah from Chipus (searching), Chipus-Chipus, Chipus from Neros, and Ner from Neros:</p></div>
<div class="indent2"><span class="nm">1.</span><p>It says "Lo Yimatzei," and "Va'Ychapes ba'Gadol ha'Chel...va'Yimatzei," and "Va'Achapes Es Yerushalayim ba'Neros," and "Ner Hash-m Nishmas Adam Chofes Kol Chadrei Vaten."</p></div>
<div class="indent1"><span class="nm">(d)</span><p><span class="cl">(Tana d'Vei R. Yishmael - Beraisa):</span> On the night of the 14th we check for Chametz by light of a Ner;</p></div>
<div class="indent1"><span class="nm">(e)</span><p>There is a hint, not a proof - It says "Lo Yimatzei," and "Va'Ychapes...va'Yimatze," and "Va'Achapes...ba'Neros," and "Ner Hash-m...Chofes..."</p></div>
<div class="indent1"><span class="nm">(f)</span><p><span class="cl">Question:</span> Why is the last verse needed?</p></div>
<div class="indent1"><span class="nm">(g)</span><p><span class="cl">Answer:</span> One might have thought that a torch is better for checking, just Hash-m will be lenient to use a Ner, so He will not find small sins - "Ner Hash-m...Chofes Kol Chadrei Vaten" shows that a Ner checks very well.</p></div>
