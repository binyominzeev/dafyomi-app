<div class="indent1"><span class="nm">(a)</span><p><span class="cl">Question:</span> What kind of Tamei may slaughter Kodshim?</p></div>
<div class="indent2"><span class="nm">1.</span><p><span class="cl">Suggestion:</span> He is Tamei Mes (from a corpse).</p></div>
<div class="indent2"><span class="nm">2.</span><p><span class="cl">Rejection:</span> Any Kli that he touches becomes Tamei. It makes the animal Tamei (after Shechitah)!</p></div>
<div class="indent1"><span class="nm">(b)</span><p><span class="cl">Answer #1:</span> Rather, he became Tamei through a Sheretz (rodent. He is not Metamei Kelim.)</p></div>
<div class="indent1"><span class="nm">(c)</span><p><span class="cl">Answer #2:</span> Really, he is Tamei Mes. He checked the shell of a reed, and slaughtered with it. (It is a Kli Etz that cannot hold anything. It cannot become Tamei).</p></div>
<div class="indent2"><span class="nm">1.</span><p><span class="cl">(Beraisa):</span> One may slaughter with anything, e.g. with a rock, or glass, or a reed.</p></div>
<div class="subject"><span class="nm">2)</span><p>A KUSI WHO SLAUGHTERS</p></div>
<div class="indent1"><span class="nm">(a)</span><p><span class="cl">Answer #2 (to Question 1:c- Abaye):</span> The Mishnah teaches 'all may slaughter', i.e. even Kusim (Nochrim who were settled in place of the 10 exiled Shevatim. They converted to avoid being eaten by lions, but they did not observe all the Mitzvos);</p></div>
<div class="indent2"><span class="nm">1.</span><p>This is only if a Yisrael supervises. If the Yisrael goes in and out, a Kusi may not slaughter;</p></div>
<div class="indent2"><span class="nm">2.</span><p>If he slaughtered, one gives the Kusi a k'Zayis (the volume of an olive) of the animal to eat. If he eats it, the animal is permitted. If not, it is forbidden.</p></div>
<div class="indent1"><span class="nm">(b)</span><p>(The Mishnah continues) 'except for a Cheresh, lunatic or minor.' If they slaughtered, the animal is forbidden, lest they pause, press, or do Chaladah.</p></div>
<div class="indent1"><span class="nm">(c)</span><p><span class="cl">Question:</span> It says 'any of them who slaughtered while others looked on, the Shechitah is Kosher.' To whom does this refer?</p></div>
<div class="indent2"><span class="nm">1.</span><p><span class="cl">Suggestion:</span> It refers to a Cheresh, lunatic or minor.</p></div>
<div class="indent2"><span class="nm">2.</span><p><span class="cl">Rejection:</span> If so, the Mishnah should have said 'if they', and not 'any of them'!</p></div>
<div class="indent1"><span class="nm">(d)</span><p><span class="cl">Answer:</span> Rather, it refers to a Kusi.</p></div>
<div class="indent1"><span class="nm">(e)</span><p><span class="cl">Objection:</span> The Reisha permits a Kusi to slaughter l'Chatchilah when a Yisrael supervises!</p></div>
<div class="indent2"><span class="nm">1.</span><p>This is left difficult.</p></div>
<div class="indent1"><span class="nm">(f)</span><p><span class="cl">Question (Rava):</span> Why does Abaye say that if the Yisrael goes in and out, the Kusi may not slaughter?</p></div>
<div class="indent2"><span class="nm">1.</span><p><span class="cl">(Mishnah):</span> If one leaves a Nochri in his store, and a Yisrael goes in and out, (the wine) is permitted.</p></div>
<div class="indent1"><span class="nm">(g)</span><p><span class="cl">Objection:</span> That question has no basis. The Mishnah does not permit leaving a Nochri in his store (if the Yisrael will go in and out). It says that if one leaves a Nochri... the wine is permitted!</p></div>
<div class="indent1"><span class="nm">(h)</span><p><span class="cl">Retraction:</span> Rather, Rava asked from the following Mishnah.</p></div>
<div class="indent2"><span class="nm">1.</span><p><span class="cl">(Mishnah):</span> The one who guards (the wine) need not sit and watch the whole time. If he goes in and out, this suffices.</p></div>
<div class="indent1"><span class="nm">(i)</span><p><span class="cl">Answer #3 (to question 1:c, Daf 2a - Rava):</span> The Mishnah teaches: 'All may slaughter' - even a Kusi;</p></div>
<div class="indent2"><span class="nm">1.</span><p>This is only if a Yisrael goes in and out;</p></div>
<div class="indent2"><span class="nm">2.</span><p>If he slaughtered unsupervised, one gives the volume of an olive of the animal to the Kusi to eat. If he eats it, the animal is permitted; if not, not.</p></div>

<div class="subject"><span class="nm">3)</span><p>A MUMAR WHO SLAUGHTERS</p></div>
<div class="indent1"><span class="nm">(a)</span><p><span class="cl">Answer #4 (Rav Ashi):</span> The Mishnah teaches: 'all may slaughter' - even a Yisrael Mumar (i.e. a wanton sinner).</p></div>
<div class="indent2"><span class="nm">1.</span><p><span class="cl">Question:</span> Regarding what is he a Mumar?</p></div>
<div class="indent2"><span class="nm">2.</span><p><span class="cl">Answer:</span> He eats Neveilos (unslaughtered animals), like Rava taught.</p></div>
<div class="indent3"><span class="nm">i.</span><p><span class="cl">(Rava):</span> If a Yisrael Mumar that eats Neveilos for pleasure (i.e. his intent is not to anger Hash-m), if one checks a knife, he may let the Mumar slaughter with it. One may eat the animal.</p></div>
<div class="bbbline">3b----------------------------------------3b</p></div>
<div class="indent1"><span class="nm">(b)</span><p>The Mishnah teaches that if one checks a knife, a Mumar may slaughter with it, and the animal may be eaten;</p></div>
<div class="indent1"><span class="nm">(c)</span><p>If the knife was not checked, a Mumar may not slaughter. If he did, we must check the knife afterwards. One may eat the animal only if the knife is good.</p></div>

<div class="indent2"><span class="nm">1.</span><p>If he slaughters with a checked knife, we said, he may slaughter l'Chatchilah!</p></div>
<div class="indent1"><span class="nm">(h)</span><p><span class="cl">Answer:</span> Rather, he slaughters with an unchecked knife.</p></div>
<div class="indent1"><span class="nm">(i)</span><p><span class="cl">Objection:</span> If the knife is around, we must check the knife!</p></div>
<div class="indent2"><span class="nm">1.</span><p>If the knife is not around, it does not help that others looked on. Perhaps the knife is invalid!</p></div>

<div class="subject"><span class="nm">4)</span><p>THE LAST ANSWER</p></div>
<div class="indent1"><span class="nm">(a)</span><p><span class="cl">Version #1 - Answer #5 (Ravina):</span> The Mishnah teaches 'all may slaughter', i.e. anyone who knows the laws, even if he is not established (that his hands are skilled, and that he does not feel faint during the Shechitah);</p></div>
<div class="indent1"><span class="nm">(b)</span><p>This applies only if we know that he knows the laws. If not, he may not slaughter.</p></div>
<div class="indent2"><span class="nm">1.</span><p>If we do not know whether he knows, and he slaughtered, we test him. If he knows the laws, the animal is permitted; if not, it is forbidden.</p></div>

<div class="indent1"><span class="nm">(f)</span><p><span class="cl">Question:</span> It suffices to test him. Why must others see the Shechitah?</p></div>
<div class="indent1"><span class="nm">(g)</span><p><span class="cl">Answer:</span> The case is, he is not here to be tested.</p></div>
<div class="indent1"><span class="nm">(h)</span><p><span class="cl">Version #2 - Answer #5 (Ravina):</span> The Mishnah teaches 'all may slaughter', i.e. anyone who is established (that his hands are skilled, and that he does not feel faint during the Shechitah), even if we do not know whether he knows the laws;</p></div>
<div class="indent1"><span class="nm">(i)</span><p>This applies only if we know that he has slaughtered in front of us two or three times without feeling faint. If not, he may not slaughter, lest he feel faint during the Shechitah.</p></div>

<div class="indent1"><span class="nm">(n)</span><p><span class="cl">Answer:</span> The case is, he is not here to be asked.</p></div>
<div class="indent2"><span class="nm">1.</span><p>Ravina and Rabah bar Ula did not learn like Abaye, Rava and Rav Ashi, due to the Question: from the Seifa 'any of them who slaughtered'.</p></div>
<div class="indent2"><span class="nm">2.</span><p>All (except for Rabah bar Ula) did not learn like Rabah bar Ula. They argue with the first explanation of his opinion, which says that our Mishnah was the proper place to teach about Shechitah of Kodshim. They hold that the Mishnah in Zevachim is the proper place!</p></div>
<div class="indent3"><span class="nm">i.</span><p>The second explanation holds that the Mishnah in Zevachim was the proper place to teach about Shechitas Kodshim. Our Mishnah teaches about Shechitah of Chulin Al Taharas Kodesh. They hold that Chulin Al Taharas Kodesh is like Chulin. We need not teach that a Tamei person may slaughter Chulin!</p></div>
<div class="indent2"><span class="nm">3.</span><p>All (the others) did not learn like Ravina. In Version #1 Ravina permits one to slaughter only if we know that he knows the laws. They hold that most who slaughter know the laws, so we assume that he knows the laws;</p></div>
<div class="indent3"><span class="nm">i.</span><p>In Version #2, Ravina permits one to slaughter only if he is established not to feel faint. They hold that we are not concerned that he will feel faint. (Most people do not feel faint.)</p></div>
<div class="indent2"><span class="nm">4.</span><p>Rava did not learn like Abaye, due to the question he asked. (A guard who goes in and out suffices.)</p></div>
<div class="indent2"><span class="nm">5.</span><p>Abaye did not learn as Rava, for Abaye holds that a guard who goes in and out suffices only for wine, which the Nochri may not touch;</p></div>
<div class="indent3"><span class="nm">i.</span><p>It is not enough for Shechitah, for the animal is the Kusi's hands.</p></div>
<div class="indent2"><span class="nm">6.</span><p>Rav Ashi did not learn as Abaye or Rava. He holds that the Kusim never sincerely converted. They merely wanted to be saved from the lions.</p></div>
<div class="indent2"><span class="nm">7.</span><p>Abaye did not learn like Rav Ashi. He argues with Rava's law (that a Mumar may slaughter with a checked knife).</p></div>
<div class="indent1"><span class="nm">(o)</span><p><span class="cl">Question:</span> Why didn't Rava learn like Rav Ashi, that the Mishnah teaches Rava's law?</p></div>
<div class="indent1"><span class="nm">(p)</span><p><span class="cl">Answer:</span> Indeed, he does!</p></div>
<div class="indent2"><span class="nm">1.</span><p>Rava addressed Abaye based on Abaye's reasoning. (Granted, you argue with me and say that a Mumar may not slaughter. Rather the Mishnah discusses Kusim. However, you should say that he may slaughter if a Yisrael goes in and out.</p></div>
<div class="subject"><span class="nm">5)</span><p>THE SHECHITAH OF A KUSI</p></div>
<div class="indent1"><span class="nm">(a)</span><p><span class="cl">(Beraisa):</span> If a Kusi slaughters, it is Kosher;</p></div>
<div class="indent2"><span class="nm">1.</span><p>This is only if a Yisrael supervises. If a Kusi slaughtered on his own, one gives to him a k'Zayis of the meat. If he eats it, the animal is permitted. If not, it is forbidden.</p></div>
