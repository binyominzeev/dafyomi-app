<div class="subject"><span class="nm">1)</span><p>CUTTING THE LEGS OF AN ANIMAL</p></div>
<div class="indent1"><span class="nm">(a)</span><p><span class="cl">(Mishnah):</span> If an animal's (hind) leg was cut from below the (knee) joint it is Kosher. If it was cut above the joint, it is Terefah;</p></div>
<div class="indent2"><span class="nm">1.</span><p>Similarly, if the juncture of the sinews was removed, it is Terefah.</p></div>
<div class="indent1"><span class="nm">(b)</span><p>If the bone was broken, if most of the skin is intact, Shechitah permits the part below the break. If not, it does not.</p></div>
<div class="indent1"><span class="nm">(c)</span><p><span class="cl">Version #1 (Gemara - Rav Yehudah):</span> 'Below' means below the joint. 'Above' means above the joint;</p></div>
<div class="indent2"><span class="nm">1.</span><p>'Joint' refers to the one normally sold with the head (the lower knee; an area analogous to the human ankle).</p></div>
<div class="indent1"><span class="nm">(d)</span><p><span class="cl">(Ula):</span> The corresponding joint of a camel is noticeable from the outside (the upper knee.)</p></div>
<div class="indent1"><span class="nm">(e)</span><p><span class="cl">Question (Ula):</span> The Mishnah fits my explanation. It teaches that if the juncture of the sinews was removed, it is Terefah, just like if the leg was cut above the upper knee.</p></div>
<div class="indent2"><span class="nm">1.</span><p>You (Rav Yehudah) say that the joint is the lower knee. Since the juncture of the sinews is above this, we already know that it is Terefah!</p></div>
<div class="indent1"><span class="nm">(f)</span><p><span class="cl">Answer (Rav Yehudah):</span> The Mishnah teaches that it is Terefah if either the bone was broken but the sinews are intact, or if the sinews were cut but the bone is intact.</p></div>
<div class="indent1"><span class="nm">(g)</span><p><span class="cl">Objection (Ula):</span> The Reisha says 'cut' (not broken). If so, the sinews were also cut!</p></div>
<div class="indent1"><span class="nm">(h)</span><p>Rav Yehudah was silent.</p></div>
<div class="indent2"><span class="nm">1.</span><p><span class="cl">Suggestion (Rav Yehudah):</span> I should have answered that 'below' means below the joint, and 'above' means above the juncture of the sinews!</p></div>
<div class="indent2"><span class="nm">2.</span><p><span class="cl">Rejection (Rav Yehudah):</span> No. Just like Ula rejected the answer I gave, he would likewise reject this. 'Above' means directly above!</p></div>
<div class="indent1"><span class="nm">(i)</span><p><span class="cl">Version #2 (Rav Yehudah):</span> 'Below' means below the joint and the juncture of the sinews. 'Above' means above the joint;</p></div>
<div class="indent2"><span class="nm">1.</span><p>Similarly, if the juncture of the sinews is removed, it is Terefah.</p></div>
<div class="indent2"><span class="nm">2.</span><p>'Joint' refers to the upper knee.</p></div>
<div class="indent1"><span class="nm">(j)</span><p><span class="cl">Question:</span> Do we ever find that if we cut below (by the juncture of the sinews), it is Terefah, but if we cut above (on the bone between the upper and lower knee) it is Kosher?!</p></div>
<div class="indent1"><span class="nm">(k)</span><p><span class="cl">Answer (Rav Ashi):</span> Yes! We cannot compare Terefos!</p></div>
<div class="subject"><span class="nm">2)</span><p>THE JUNCTURE OF THE SINEWS (TZOMES HA'GIDIM)</p></div>
<div class="indent1"><span class="nm">(a)</span><p><span class="cl">Question:</span> What is considered the juncture of the sinews?</p></div>
<div class="indent1"><span class="nm">(b)</span><p><span class="cl">Answer #1 (Rabah):</span> It is from where they leave the bone and beyond.</p></div>
<div class="indent1"><span class="nm">(c)</span><p><span class="cl">Answer #2 (Rabah bar Rav Huna):</span> It is from where they leave the bone, towards the inside.</p></div>
<div class="indent1"><span class="nm">(d)</span><p><span class="cl">Answer #3 (Rava brei d'Rabah bar Rav Huna):</span> It is above the Arkuma (a bone of the lower knee.)</p></div>
<div class="indent2"><span class="nm">1.</span><p>A Talmid was saying that the juncture of the sinews is at the Arkuma itself.</p></div>
<div class="indent2"><span class="nm">2.</span><p><span class="cl">R. Aba:</span> That is wrong. Rav Yehudah taught that it is where butchers start flaying the leg.</p></div>
<div class="indent1"><span class="nm">(e)</span><p><span class="cl">Question:</span> How far does the juncture extend?</p></div>
<div class="indent1"><span class="nm">(f)</span><p><span class="cl">Answer (Abaye):</span> In an ox, it is the width of four fingers (Rashi; many explain, the width of 16 fingers.)</p></div>
<div class="indent1"><span class="nm">(g)</span><p><span class="cl">Question:</span> How far does it extend in a small animal?</p></div>
<div class="indent1"><span class="nm">(h)</span><p><span class="cl">Answer (Abaye):</span> The following are the characteristics that show that an area is the juncture of the sinews:</p></div>
<div class="indent2"><span class="nm">1.</span><p>The sinews stick out of the flesh. They are not buried in it;</p></div>
<div class="indent2"><span class="nm">2.</span><p>The sinews are hard, and not soft. They are strong, and not weak. They are large, and not small;</p></div>
<div class="indent2"><span class="nm">3.</span><p>They are white. If not, they are not part of the juncture of the sinews.</p></div>
<div class="bbbline">76b----------------------------------------76b</p></div>
<div class="indent1"><span class="nm">(i)</span><p><span class="cl">(Mar bar Rav Ashi):</span> If they are clear, even if they are not white they are the juncture of the sinews.</p></div>
<div class="indent1"><span class="nm">(j)</span><p><span class="cl">(Ameimar):</span> There are three sinews. One is great and two are small;</p></div>
<div class="indent2"><span class="nm">1.</span><p>If the great one breaks, the majority of the support is gone. It is Terefah;</p></div>
<div class="indent2"><span class="nm">2.</span><p>If the small ones break, the majority of sinews are broken. It is Terefah.</p></div>
<div class="indent1"><span class="nm">(k)</span><p><span class="cl">(Mar bar Rav Ashi):</span> If the great one breaks, the majority of sinews is intact. It is Kosher;</p></div>
<div class="indent2"><span class="nm">1.</span><p>If the small ones break, the majority of the support is intact. It is Kosher.</p></div>
<div class="indent1"><span class="nm">(l)</span><p>In birds, there are 16 sinews. If any one of them breaks, it is Terefah.</p></div>
<div class="indent2"><span class="nm">1.</span><p>Rav Ashi inspected a bird and found 15. One of which was extra thick. He unraveled it, and found that it was really two.</p></div>
<div class="indent1"><span class="nm">(m)</span><p><span class="cl">(Rav Yehudah citing Rav):</span> If the majority of the juncture of the sinews breaks, it is Terefah.</p></div>
<div class="indent1"><span class="nm">(n)</span><p><span class="cl">Question:</span> What does Rav call 'the majority'?</p></div>
<div class="indent1"><span class="nm">(o)</span><p><span class="cl">Version #1 - Answer:</span> He means the majority of one of them.</p></div>
<div class="indent1"><span class="nm">(p)</span><p><span class="cl">Objection (Rav Yehudah citing Shmuel):</span> Even if one would break entirely, two would remain (it would be Kosher)!</p></div>
<div class="indent2"><span class="nm">1.</span><p><span class="cl">Inference:</span> Shmuel requires that two remain. If two were cut, it would be Terefah. This argues with Ravnai's version of Shmuel's opinion.</p></div>
<div class="indent2"><span class="nm">2.</span><p><span class="cl">(Ravnai citing Shmuel):</span> Even if a sinew (weak) like a drawstring (that supports a neckline) remains, it is Kosher.)</p></div>
<div class="indent1"><span class="nm">(q)</span><p><span class="cl">Version #2 - Answer:</span> He means the majority of every one of them.</p></div>
<div class="indent1"><span class="nm">(r)</span><p><span class="cl">Objection (Rav Yehudah citing Shmuel):</span> Since there are three, even if a third of each sinew would remain, it would be Kosher!</p></div>
<div class="indent2"><span class="nm">1.</span><p>This supports Ravnai.</p></div>
<div class="indent2"><span class="nm">2.</span><p><span class="cl">(Ravnai citing Shmuel):</span> Even if a sinew like a drawstring remains, it is Kosher.</p></div>
<div class="subject"><span class="nm">3)</span><p>A BROKEN LEG</p></div>
<div class="indent1"><span class="nm">(a)</span><p><span class="cl">(Mishnah):</span> If the bone was broken... .</p></div>
<div class="indent1"><span class="nm">(b)</span><p><span class="cl">(Rav):</span> (If the break is) above the knee, if most of the flesh remains, the animal and the (bottom of the) leg are both permitted. If not, both are forbidden;</p></div>
<div class="indent2"><span class="nm">1.</span><p>(If the break is) below the knee, if most of the flesh remains, the animal and the leg are both permitted. If not, the animal is permitted, and the leg is forbidden.</p></div>
<div class="indent1"><span class="nm">(c)</span><p><span class="cl">(Shmuel):</span> In all cases, the animal is permitted. If most of the flesh remains, also the leg is permitted. If not, it is not.</p></div>
<div class="indent1"><span class="nm">(d)</span><p><span class="cl">Question (Rav Nachman against Shmuel):</span> People will say that the leg is in the wasteheap (it is as if it fell off), yet the animal is permitted?!</p></div>
<div class="indent2"><span class="nm">1.</span><p><span class="cl">Question (Rav Acha bar Rav Huna against Rav Nachman):</span> This also challenges Rav. People will say that the leg is in the wasteheap, yet the animal is permitted?!</p></div>
<div class="indent2"><span class="nm">2.</span><p><span class="cl">Answer (Rav Nachman):</span> I meant that they will say 'a limb vital to the life of the animal is in the wasteheap, yet the animal is permitted?!' (Rav permitted only when the break is below the knee.)</p></div>
<div class="indent1"><span class="nm">(e)</span><p>Chachamim of Eretz Yisrael sent three messages (to Bavel). First they said that the Halachah follows Rav. Later, they ruled like Shmuel. Later, they again ruled like Rav, and said that the leg has Tum'as Masa. (It is Metamei one who moves it.)</p></div>
<div class="indent1"><span class="nm">(f)</span><p><span class="cl">Question (Rav Chisda - Beraisa):</span> Shechitah is Metaher (even) a Terefah animal, and a dangling limb, for this is part of the animal. You have no source to be Metaher the fetus, for it is not part of the animal.</p></div>
<div class="indent2"><span class="nm">1.</span><p><span class="cl">Question (Rabah):</span> Why did you ask from a Beraisa, and not from a Mishnah?</p></div>
<div class="indent3"><span class="nm">i.</span><p><span class="cl">(Mishnah):</span> If an animal (with a dangling limb and flesh) was slaughtered, they (the limb and flesh) are Huchsheru (implying, they do not have Tum'as Nevelah!)</p></div>
<div class="indent2"><span class="nm">2.</span><p><span class="cl">Answer (Rav Chisda):</span> One could explain the Mishnah like above (73b. 'They', i.e. dangling flesh and meat that separated from a dangling limb, become Huchsheru.</p></div>
<div class="indent1"><span class="nm">(g)</span><p>R. Yirmeyah bar Aba was teaching Rav's opinion.</p></div>
<div class="indent2"><span class="nm">1.</span><p><span class="cl">R. Zeira:</span> Very good. Also Shmuel holds like this.</p></div>
<div class="indent2"><span class="nm">2.</span><p><span class="cl">Question:</span> Shmuel argues!</p></div>
<div class="indent2"><span class="nm">3.</span><p><span class="cl">Answer:</span> Shmuel retracted, and agreed with Rav.</p></div>
<div class="indent1"><span class="nm">(h)</span><p><span class="cl">(Beraisa):</span> If the bone broke and it sticks out:</p></div>
<div class="indent2"><span class="nm">1.</span><p>If skin and flesh cover the majority, it is permitted; if not, it is forbidden.</p></div>
<div class="indent1"><span class="nm">(i)</span><p><span class="cl">Question:</span> What is considered the majority?</p></div>
<div class="indent1"><span class="nm">(j)</span><p><span class="cl">Version #1 (Rav Dimi):</span> We require the majority of the thickness of the bone.</p></div>
<div class="indent1"><span class="nm">(k)</span><p><span class="cl">Version #2 (Rav Dimi):</span> We require the majority of the circumference. (Tosfos - if the broken surface of the bone is not circular, this differs from the majority of the thickness; Rashi - in Version #2, we do not care if the broken surface juts out; in Version #1, the only concern is that most of the surface of the break is covered.) (end of Version #2)</p></div>
<div class="indent1"><span class="nm">(l)</span><p><span class="cl">(Rav Papa):</span> Since we do not know which is correct, we require both majorities.</p></div>
<div class="indent1"><span class="nm">(m)</span><p><span class="cl">Version #1 (Ula):</span> Skin is like flesh (regarding covering the majority).</p></div>
<div class="indent1"><span class="nm">(n)</span><p><span class="cl">Question (Rav Nachman):</span> You should say that skin joins with flesh (i.e. that both are required)!</p></div>
<div class="indent1"><span class="nm">(o)</span><p><span class="cl">Answer (Ula):</span> The text of the Beraisa says 'skin or flesh'.</p></div>
<div class="indent1"><span class="nm">(p)</span><p><span class="cl">Version #2 (Ula):</span> Skin joins up with flesh.</p></div>
<div class="indent1"><span class="nm">(q)</span><p><span class="cl">Question (Rav Nachman):</span> You should say skin can complete the required majority of flesh covering the bone (i.e. most of the covering must come from the flesh)!</p></div>
<div class="indent1"><span class="nm">(r)</span><p><span class="cl">Answer (Ula):</span> I saw R. Yochanan permit a chick in which skin joined flesh to cover most of a break.</p></div>
<div class="indent1"><span class="nm">(s)</span><p><span class="cl">Rejection (Rav Nachman):</span> You cannot learn from that case. The skin of chicks is very soft, like flesh!</p></div>
