<p class="bas subject"><span class="nm">1)</span>THOSE WHO REST ON <i>SHABBOS</i></p>
<p class="bas indent1"><span class="nm">(a)</span><span class="cl">(Mishnah):</span> If one is Mudar Hana'ah from those who cease on Shabbos or from those who eat garlic, he may not benefit from Yisraelim nor from Kusim;</p>
<p class="bas indent1"><span class="nm">(b)</span>If he vowed from those who ascend to Yerushalayim on the festivals, he may benefit from Kusim, but not from Yisraelim.</p>
<p class="bas indent1"><span class="nm">(c)</span><span class="cl">(Gemara) Question:</span> What does it mean, those who cease on Shabbos?</p>
<p class="bas indent2"><span class="nm">1.</span><span class="cl">Suggestion:</span> It means those who do not work on Shabbos.</p>
<p class="bas indent2"><span class="nm">2.</span><span class="cl">Rejection:</span> If so, why does it say only that he may not benefit from Kusim? He may not benefit even from Nochrim who do not work on Shabbos!</p>
<p class="bas indent1"><span class="nm">(d)</span><span class="cl">Answer #1:</span> Rather, it means those who are commanded to keep Shabbos.</p>
<p class="bas indent1"><span class="nm">(e)</span><span class="cl">Objection (Seifa):</span> If he vowed 'from those who ascend to Yerushalayim', he may benefit from Kusim.'</p>
<p class="bas indent2"><span class="nm">1.</span>Kusim are also commanded about this!</p>
<p class="bas indent1"><span class="nm">(f)</span><span class="cl">Answer #2 (Abaye):</span> The Mishnah discusses those who are commanded and observe.</p>
<p class="bas indent2"><span class="nm">1.</span>Regarding Shabbos and eating garlic, Yisraelim and Kusim are commanded and observe. (Ezra decreed to eat garlic on Shabbos night.) A Nochri who observes is not commanded;</p>
<p class="bas indent2"><span class="nm">2.</span>Regarding ascending to Yerushalayim, Yisraelim and Kusim are commanded. Yisraelim observe the Mitzvah, but Kusim do not.</p>
<p class="bas subject"><span class="nm">2)</span>WHO IS CONSIDERED A <i>YISRAEL</i>?</p>
<p class="bas indent1"><span class="nm">(a)</span><span class="cl">(Mishnah):</span> If one is Mudar Hana'ah from Bnei Noach, he may benefit from Yisraelim, but not from Nochrim.</p>
<p class="bas indent1"><span class="nm">(b)</span><span class="cl">(Gemara) Question:</span> Yisraelim are also Bnei Noach!</p>
<p class="bas indent1"><span class="nm">(c)</span><span class="cl">Answer:</span> Since Avraham was made Kodesh, Yisraelim are called by his name, not by Noach's.</p>
<p class="bas indent1"><span class="nm">(d)</span><span class="cl">(Mishnah):</span> If one is Mudar Hana'ah from the seed of Avraham, he may benefit from Nochrim, but not from Yisraelim.</p>
<p class="bas indent1"><span class="nm">(e)</span><span class="cl">(Gemara) Question:</span> Why are all Nochrim permitted? He should be forbidden to benefit from the seed of Yishmael!</p>
<p class="bas indent1"><span class="nm">(f)</span><span class="cl">Answer:</span> Hash-m told Avraham "Your seed will be called in Yitzchak."</p>
<p class="bas indent1"><span class="nm">(g)</span><span class="cl">Question:</span> Why is he permitted to the seed of Esav?</p>
<p class="bas indent1"><span class="nm">(h)</span><span class="cl">Answer:</span> "In Yitzchak", not all of Yitzchak.</p>
<p class="bas subject"><span class="nm">3)</span>ONE WHO IS <i>MUDAR</i> <i>HANA'AH</i> FROM <i>YISRAELIM</i></p>
<p class="bas indent1"><span class="nm">(a)</span><span class="cl">(Mishnah):</span> If one is Mudar Hana'ah from Yisraelim, when he buys from a Yisrael, he must pay more than the standard price. When he sells to a Yisrael, he must sell for less than the standard price;</p>
<p class="bas indent1"><span class="nm">(b)</span>If one vowed that Yisraelim will not benefit from himself, when he buys from (or sells to) a Yisrael, he must pay less (receive more) than the standard price;</p>
<p class="bas indent2"><span class="nm">1.</span>People will not buy from or sell to him.</p>
<p class="bas indent1"><span class="nm">(c)</span>If one vowed not to benefit from nor give benefit to Yisrael, he can do commerce only with Nochrim.</p>
<p class="bas indent1"><span class="nm">(d)</span><span class="cl">(Gemara - Shmuel):</span> If one took a Kli from a craftsman to inspect it (to see if he wants to buy it), and it was lost or ruined b'Ones (through circumstances beyond his control), he must pay for it.</p>
<p class="bas indent2"><span class="nm">1.</span>This shows that he holds that a buyer benefits from a sale (and therefore he is considered a borrower).</p>
<p class="bas indent1"><span class="nm">(e)</span><span class="cl">Question (Mishnah):</span> If one is Mudar Hana'ah from Yisraelim, when he sells to a Yisrael, he must sell for less.</p>
<p class="bas indent2"><span class="nm">1.</span><span class="cl">Inference:</span> He may not sell for the exact value.</p>
<p class="bas indent2"><span class="nm">2.</span>If the buyer benefits from a sale, this should be permitted!</p>
<p class="bas indent1"><span class="nm">(f)</span><span class="cl">Answer:</span> The Mishnah discusses an item that is hard to sell. The seller is happy to sell it.</p>
<p class="bas indent1"><span class="nm">(g)</span><span class="cl">Question #1:</span> If so, the one who vowed should be allowed to buy for the exact value! (The Mishnah says that he must pay more!)</p>
<p class="bas indent1"><span class="nm">(h)</span><span class="cl">Question #2 (Seifa):</span> If he vowed that Yisraelim will not benefit from him, he must sell for a higher price.</p>
<p class="bas indent2"><span class="nm">1.</span>If the item is hard to sell, he should be allowed to sell for the exact value!</p>
<p class="bas indent1"><span class="nm">(i)</span><span class="cl">Answer #1 (to question #2):</span> The Seifa discusses an item in great demand.</p>
<p class="bas indent1"><span class="nm">(j)</span><span class="cl">Objection:</span> If so, why must he buy for less than the value? He should be allowed to buy for the exact value!</p>
<p class="bas bbbline">31b----------------------------------------31b</p>
<p class="bas indent1"><span class="nm">(k)</span><span class="cl">Answer (to Question 1 and Answer #2 to Question 2):</span> The Mishnah discusses a standard item. Shmuel discussed an item in great demand.</p>
<p class="bas indent1"><span class="nm">(l)</span><span class="cl">Support (for Shmuel - Beraisa):</span> A man took Kelim from a merchant to send to his father-in-law's house. He stipulated: if they want them, I will pay their full value. If not, I will pay you what it was worth to me to show them that I wanted to give them such gifts;</p>
<p class="bas indent2"><span class="nm">1.</span>If the Kelim were lost or damaged b'Ones on the way to his father-in-law, the buyer must pay. If they were lost on the way back, he is exempt, since he is like a paid watchman.</p>
<p class="bas indent1"><span class="nm">(m)</span>A retailer took wine to sell; he did not sell it. An Ones occurred on the way to return it. Rav Nachman ruled that he must pay.</p>
<p class="bas indent1"><span class="nm">(n)</span><span class="cl">Question (Rava - Beraisa):</span> On the way, the buyer is liable. On the way back, he is exempt.</p>
<p class="bas indent1"><span class="nm">(o)</span><span class="cl">Answer (Rav Nachman):</span> For a retailer, on the way back is like on the way, since the retailer is always looking to sell it, even at the door of his supplier!</p>
<p class="bas subject"><span class="nm">4)</span>THE GREATNESS OF CIRCUMCISION</p>
<p class="bas indent1"><span class="nm">(a)</span><span class="cl">(Mishnah):</span> If a man vowed not to benefit from Areilim (uncircumcised people), he may benefit from an Arel Yisrael but not from a Mahul (circumcised) Nochri;</p>
<p class="bas indent1"><span class="nm">(b)</span>If he said 'I will not benefit from Mahulim', he may not benefit from an Arel Yisrael, but he may benefit a circumcised Nochri;</p>
<p class="bas indent2"><span class="nm">1.</span>Only Nochrim are called Areilim. It says "all the nations are Areilim. All of Yisrael have Arel hearts", and "this Arel Pelishti", and "Benos Pelishtim... Benos ha'Areilim".</p>
<p class="bas indent1"><span class="nm">(c)</span>R. Eliezer ben Azaryah says, the foreskin is repulsive. The wicked are debased through it - "All the nations are Areilim".</p>
<p class="bas indent1"><span class="nm">(d)</span>R. Yishmael says, circumcision is great. Thirteen covenants were made over it.</p>
<p class="bas indent1"><span class="nm">(e)</span>R. Yosi says, circumcision is great. It overrides the severe Isur of Shabbos.</p>
<p class="bas indent1"><span class="nm">(f)</span>R. Yehoshua ben Korchah says, circumcision is great. Moshe was about to be killed for a short delay in performing it!</p>
<p class="bas indent1"><span class="nm">(g)</span>R. Nechemyah says, circumcision is great. It overrides the Isur of cutting off Tzara'as.</p>
<p class="bas indent1"><span class="nm">(h)</span>Rebbi says, circumcision is great. In spite of all his Mitzvos, Avraham was not called complete until he circumcised himself - "Walk in front of Me and be perfect."</p>
<p class="bas indent2"><span class="nm">1.</span>Also - circumcision is great, for Hash-m made the world just for it - "If not for Berisi (My covenant) day and night, I would not have made Shamayim and earth."</p>
<p class="bas indent1"><span class="nm">(i)</span><span class="cl">(Gemara - Beraisa - R. Yehoshua ben Korchah):</span> Circumcision is great. All of Moshe's merits did not protect him when he slackened from circumcising (his son) - "Hash-m sought to kill him";</p>
<p class="bas indent1"><span class="nm">(j)</span><span class="cl">(Rebbi):</span> Do not say that Moshe slackened! Rather, he was pondering.</p>
<p class="bas indent2"><span class="nm">1.</span>If I circumcise my son, then take him with me to Mitzrayim, this will endanger him, like we find regarding Shechem - "on the third day, when they were in pain..."</p>
<p class="bas indent2"><span class="nm">2.</span><span class="cl">Suggestion:</span> Perhaps I should circumcise him immediately, and wait three days.</p>
<p class="bas indent2"><span class="nm">3.</span><span class="cl">Rejection:</span> Hash-m told me to return to Mitzrayim (right away)!</p>
<p class="bas indent1"><span class="nm">(k)</span><span class="cl">Question:</span> If so, why was he punished?</p>
