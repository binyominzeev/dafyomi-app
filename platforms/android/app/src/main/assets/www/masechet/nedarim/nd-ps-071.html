<p class="bas indent1"><span class="nm">(a)</span><span class="cl">(Mishnah):</span> If an Arusah vowed, was divorced that same day, and became Mekudeshes again the same day, even if she remarried 100 times that day, her father and the last Arus annul her vows;</p>
<p class="bas indent1"><span class="nm">(b)</span>The rule is, as long as she was never in her own Reshus, her father and the last Arus annul her vows.</p>
<p class="bas indent1"><span class="nm">(c)</span><span class="cl">(Gemara - Shmuel) Question:</span> What is the source that the last Arus can annul vows heard by the first?</p>
<p class="bas indent1"><span class="nm">(d)</span><span class="cl">Answer (Shmuel):</span> "If she will be to a man, and her vows are upon her" refers to vows that were already on her.</p>
<p class="bas indent1"><span class="nm">(e)</span><span class="cl">Question:</span> Perhaps that is only if the first Arus did not hear them!</p>
<p class="bas indent1"><span class="nm">(f)</span><span class="cl">Answer:</span> "Upon her" is extra to include vows heard by the first Arus.</p>
<p class="bas indent1"><span class="nm">(g)</span><span class="cl">Support (for Shmuel - Beraisa):</span> The father and Arus of a Na'arah Me'orasah annul her vows;</p>
<p class="bas indent2"><span class="nm">1.</span>If the father heard her vow and annulled it, and her Arus died before he heard it, and she became Mekudeshes that day, even 100 times, her father and her last Arus annul her vows.</p>
<p class="bas indent2"><span class="nm">2.</span>If the Arus heard her vow and annulled it and died before the father heard it, the father can annul the portion of the Arus.</p>
<p class="bas indent2"><span class="nm">3.</span>R. Nasan says, this is Beis Shamai's opinion. Beis Hillel say that he cannot annul.</p>
<p class="bas indent2"><span class="nm">4.</span><span class="cl">Question:</span> What do they argue about?</p>
<p class="bas bbbline">71b----------------------------------------71b</p>
<p class="bas indent2"><span class="nm">5.</span><span class="cl">Answer:</span> Beis Shamai hold that (when she is widowed or divorced) the father receives Reshus to annul even vows that the first Arus heard. When one of them annuls, he annuls his half;</p>
<p class="bas indent3"><span class="nm">i.</span>Beis Hillel hold that the father and the last Arus annul her vows. When one partner annuls, he does not annul his half (rather, he weakens the whole vow).</p>
<p class="bas subject"><span class="nm">2)</span>IS DIVORCE LIKE AFFIRMATION?</p>
<p class="bas indent1"><span class="nm">(a)</span><span class="cl">Question:</span> If her Arus divorced her on the day he heard her vow, is it as if he affirmed it, or as if he was quiet?</p>
<p class="bas indent2"><span class="nm">1.</span>This determines the law in the case that he remarries her the same day.</p>
<p class="bas indent3"><span class="nm">i.</span>If divorce is as if he was quiet, he can annul the vow;</p>
<p class="bas indent3"><span class="nm">ii.</span>If it is like affirmation, he can no longer annul.</p>
