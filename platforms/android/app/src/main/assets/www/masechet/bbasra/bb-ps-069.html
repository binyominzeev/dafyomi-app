<p class="bas indent1"><span class="nm">(a)</span><span class="cl">(Gemara) Question:</span> Which rocks are needed for the field?</p>
<p class="bas indent1"><span class="nm">(b)</span><span class="cl">Answer #1 (Chachamim of Bavel):</span> They are rocks that hold down sheaves left to dry so they will not be blown away.</p>
<p class="bas indent1"><span class="nm">(c)</span><span class="cl">Answer #2 (Ula):</span> They are rocks arranged like a wall around the field.</p>
<p class="bas indent1"><span class="nm">(d)</span><span class="cl">Question:</span> R. Chiya taught a Beraisa that says that they are rocks gathered near the wall (even of they are not arranged like a wall)!</p>
<p class="bas indent1"><span class="nm">(e)</span><span class="cl">Answer:</span> We must change the text of the Beraisa to say <i>arranged</i> like a wall.</p>
<p class="bas indent1"><span class="nm">(f)</span><span class="cl">(Chachamim of Bavel):</span> They are rocks that hold down sheaves.</p>
<p class="bas indent2"><span class="nm">1.</span>According to R. Meir (78b, who considers more things to be needs of a vineyard than Chachamim do), rocks prepared for this are included, even if they are not in the field;</p>
<p class="bas indent2"><span class="nm">2.</span>According to Chachamim, they are included only if they are in the field.</p>
<p class="bas indent1"><span class="nm">(g)</span><span class="cl">(Ula):</span> They are rocks arranged like a wall around the field.</p>

<p class="bas indent2"><span class="nm">2.</span>According to Chachamim, they are included only if they are arranged.</p>
<p class="bas indent1"><span class="nm">(h)</span><span class="cl">(Mishnah):</span> Reeds needed for a vineyard.</p>
<p class="bas indent1"><span class="nm">(i)</span><span class="cl">Question:</span> Why are reeds needed for a vineyard?</p>
<p class="bas indent1"><span class="nm">(j)</span><span class="cl">Answer (d'Vei R. Yanai):</span> They are to support the vines.</p>
<p class="bas indent2"><span class="nm">1.</span>According to R. Meir, they are included if they are smoothed out, even if they are not inserted in the ground;</p>
<p class="bas indent2"><span class="nm">2.</span>According to Chachamim, they are included only if they are inserted in the ground.</p>
<p class="bas indent1"><span class="nm">(k)</span><span class="cl">(Mishnah):</span> Attached grain.</p>
<p class="bas indent1"><span class="nm">(l)</span>This is even if it is ready to be harvested.</p>
<p class="bas indent1"><span class="nm">(m)</span><span class="cl">(Mishnah):</span>  Clusters of reeds that are less than Beis Rova.</p>
<p class="bas indent1"><span class="nm">(n)</span>This is even if they are strong.</p>
<p class="bas indent1"><span class="nm">(o)</span><span class="cl">(Mishnah):</span> A guardhouse that is not plastered.</p>

<p class="bas indent1"><span class="nm">(q)</span><span class="cl">(Mishnah):</span> A young carob tree that has not yet been grafted, a sycamore tree that has not yet been pruned.</p>
<p class="bas indent1"><span class="nm">(r)</span>This is even if they are strong.</p>
<p class="bas subject"><span class="nm">2)</span>WHAT IS NOT INCLUDED WITH A FIELD</p>
<p class="bas indent1"><span class="nm">(a)</span><span class="cl">(Mishnah):</span> It does not include rocks not needed for the field.</p>
<p class="bas indent2"><span class="nm">1.</span>According to R. Meir, the rocks were not prepared;</p>
<p class="bas indent2"><span class="nm">2.</span>According to Chachamim, (even if they were prepared), if they are not in the field they are excluded.</p>
<p class="bas indent2"><span class="nm">3.</span>According to Ula, who explained that the rocks are to make a wall, according to R. Meir, they are excluded if they are not prepared;</p>
<p class="bas indent2"><span class="nm">4.</span>According to Chachamim, they are excluded if they are not arranged.</p>
<p class="bas indent1"><span class="nm">(b)</span><span class="cl">(Mishnah):</span> Nor reeds not needed for a vineyard.</p>
<p class="bas indent2"><span class="nm">1.</span>According to R. Meir, they are excluded if they are not smoothed out;</p>
<p class="bas indent2"><span class="nm">2.</span>According to Chachamim, they are excluded if they are not inserted in the ground.</p>
<p class="bas indent1"><span class="nm">(c)</span><span class="cl">(Mishnah):</span> Nor detached grain.</p>
<p class="bas indent1"><span class="nm">(d)</span>This is even if it must remain on the ground (to dry out).</p>
<p class="bas indent1"><span class="nm">(e)</span><span class="cl">(Mishnah):</span>  Nor clusters of reeds more than Beis Rova.</p>
<p class="bas indent1"><span class="nm">(f)</span>This is even if the reeds are small.</p>
<p class="bas indent1"><span class="nm">(g)</span><span class="cl">(R. Chiya bar Aba):</span> Not only clusters of reeds, but even a small spice patch, if it is called by its own name, is not included.</p>
<p class="bas indent1"><span class="nm">(h)</span><span class="cl">(Rav Papa):</span> This is only if it is called 'Ploni's spice-patch'.</p>
<p class="bas indent1"><span class="nm">(i)</span><span class="cl">(Mishnah):</span> Nor a guardhouse that is plastered.</p>
<p class="bas indent1"><span class="nm">(j)</span>This is even if it is fixed in the ground.</p>
<p class="bas indent1"><span class="nm">(k)</span><span class="cl">Question (R. Elazar):</span> Are frames around the door (Tosfos - of the guardhouse; Rashbam - of a house that is sold) included?</p>
<p class="bas indent2"><span class="nm">1.</span>If they are attached with plaster, surely they are included;</p>
<p class="bas indent2"><span class="nm">2.</span>He asks about when they are on pegs.</p>

<p class="bas indent1"><span class="nm">(l)</span><span class="cl">Question (R. Zeira):</span> Are frames around the window included?</p>
<p class="bas indent2"><span class="nm">1.</span>Do we say that they are just for decoration, so they are not included?</p>
<p class="bas indent2"><span class="nm">2.</span>Or, since they are attached, they are included?</p>
<p class="bas indent2"><span class="nm">3.</span>This question is not resolved.</p>
<p class="bas indent1"><span class="nm">(m)</span><span class="cl">Question (R. Yirmeyah):</span> Are tiles placed under legs of a bed (to prevent the legs from rotting) sold (with the bed)?</p>

<p class="bas indent1"><span class="nm">(b)</span><span class="cl">Question:</span> What is the source of this?</p>
<p class="bas indent1"><span class="nm">(c)</span><span class="cl">Answer (Rav Yehudah):</span> "V'Chol ha'Etz... Asher b'Chol Gevulo" - trees that need a border around them (because they are unimportant, people could contest them) are included;</p>
<p class="bas indent2"><span class="nm">1.</span>Important trees are known (to whom they belong). They do not need a border, and they are not included.</p>
<p class="bas indent1"><span class="nm">(d)</span><span class="cl">(Rav Mesharshiya):</span> This is the source that one who buys a field also acquires the border.</p>
<p class="bas indent1"><span class="nm">(e)</span><span class="cl">(Rav Yehudah):</span> If one sells land, he must write 'acquire it and the date trees (of various types) and saplings';</p>
<p class="bas indent2"><span class="nm">1.</span>Even though he acquires them if this was not written, one should write the document so that no Beis Din could err.</p>
<p class="bas indent1"><span class="nm">(f)</span>If Reuven sold 'my land and date trees', if he has date trees, he must give two. If he has no date trees, he must buy two and give them. If a creditor has a lien on the trees, he must redeem them (pay their value to the creditor to release the lien on them).</p>
<p class="bas indent1"><span class="nm">(g)</span>If Reuven sold 'my land with date trees', if it has date trees, he gives them (Bach's text - the sale is valid). If it has no date trees, the sale is void.</p>
<p class="bas indent1"><span class="nm">(h)</span>If he sold 'my  land Bei Dikli (of date trees)', if it has no date trees, he meant 'that is fitting to grow date trees' (the sale is valid).</p>
<p class="bas indent1"><span class="nm">(i)</span>If he sold 'except for Dekel Plonis (a particular date tree)', if it is a good tree, he excluded only it. If it is bad, all the more so he excluded the good date trees!</p>
<p class="bas indent1"><span class="nm">(j)</span>If he sold 'except for trees', if it has (regular) trees, he excluded them. If it has only date trees, he excluded them. If it has no trees, only vines, they are excluded.</p>
<p class="bas indent2"><span class="nm">1.</span>If it has trees and vines, the trees are excluded. If it has trees and date trees, only the trees are excluded. If it has date trees and vines, the vines are excluded. (Rashbam - they are considered trees more than date trees are.)</p>
