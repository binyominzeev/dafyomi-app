<p class="bas subject"><span class="nm">1)</span>WHEN IS A FETUS BORN?</p>
<p class="bas indent1"><span class="nm">(a)</span><span class="cl">Version #1 (Mishnah):</span> If the fetus came out cut up or Mesuras (out of order, the head was not first)...</p>
<p class="bas indent1"><span class="nm">(b)</span><span class="cl">(R. Elazar):</span> Even if the head came out, it is not considered born until the majority leaves.</p>
<p class="bas indent1"><span class="nm">(c)</span><span class="cl">(R. Yochanan):</span> Once the head comes out, it is considered born.</p>
<p class="bas indent1"><span class="nm">(d)</span><span class="cl">Suggestion:</span> They argue about Shmuel's law.</p>
<p class="bas indent2"><span class="nm">1.</span><span class="cl">(Shmuel):</span> If the head of a Nefel left the womb, this is not considered birth. (If a twin will leave the womb after the Nefel, it is the Peter Rechem. It must be redeemed.)</p>
<p class="bas indent1"><span class="nm">(e)</span><span class="cl">Rejection:</span> No, both agree that the head of an intact Nefel is considered birth (unlike Shmuel);</p>
<p class="bas indent2"><span class="nm">1.</span>They argue only when the Nefel is cut up. R. Elazar holds that in this case, the head is not important. It is not born until the majority leaves;</p>
<p class="bas indent2"><span class="nm">2.</span>R. Yochanan holds that even in this case the head is important. Once it leaves, the Nefel is born.</p>
<p class="bas indent1"><span class="nm">(f)</span><span class="cl">Version #2 (R. Elazar):</span> The head is not considered like the majority of the limbs</p>
<p class="bas indent1"><span class="nm">(g)</span><span class="cl">(R. Yochanan):</span> Once the head comes out, it is considered born.</p>
<p class="bas indent1"><span class="nm">(h)</span><span class="cl">Suggestion:</span> They argue about Shmuel's law.</p>
<p class="bas indent1"><span class="nm">(i)</span><span class="cl">Question (against R. Yochanan - Mishnah):</span> If the fetus came out cut up or Mesuras, it is not considered born until the majority leaves.</p>
<p class="bas indent2"><span class="nm">1.</span><span class="cl">Inference:</span> Since it says cut up <i>or</i> Mesuras, in the first case (it was cut up), it came out normally (headfirst), and it is not born until the majority leaves!</p>
<p class="bas indent1"><span class="nm">(j)</span><span class="cl">Answer #1:</span> It means, if the fetus came out cut up <i>and</i> Mesuras...</p>
<p class="bas indent1"><span class="nm">(k)</span><span class="cl">Objection:</span> It says '... <i>or</i> Mesuras'!</p>
<p class="bas indent1"><span class="nm">(l)</span><span class="cl">Answer #2:</span> Rather, it means, if the fetus came out cut up <i>or</i> <i>whole</i>, <i>and</i> it was Mesuras, when the majority leaves it is considered born.</p>
<p class="bas indent1"><span class="nm">(m)</span><span class="cl">(Rav Papa):</span> Tana'im argue as R. Elazar and R. Yochanan do:</p>
<p class="bas indent2"><span class="nm">1.</span><span class="cl">(Beraisa):</span> If the fetus came out cut up or Mesuras, when the majority leaves it is considered born;</p>
<p class="bas indent2"><span class="nm">2.</span>R. Yosi says, when it comes out properly (headfirst).</p>
<p class="bas indent2"><span class="nm">3.</span><span class="cl">Question:</span> What does R. Yosi mean? (Tosfos - surely he agrees that if it is intact, even if it is Mesuras, when the majority leaves it is considered born!)</p>
<p class="bas indent2"><span class="nm">4.</span><span class="cl">Answer #1 (Rav Papa):</span> The first Tana says, if the fetus came out cut up <i>and</i> Mesuras, when the majority leaves it is considered born;</p>
<p class="bas indent3"><span class="nm">i.</span>Had the head left first, this would have been considered birth;</p>
<p class="bas indent3"><span class="nm">ii.</span>R. Yosi says, it is born when the majority leaves properly.</p>
<p class="bas indent2"><span class="nm">5.</span><span class="cl">Objection (Rav Zevid):</span> This implies that R. Yosi holds that if the majority left Mesuras, it is not born. However, we hold that the majority is like the whole! (This is a great general rule. Surely, R. Yosi agrees.)</p>
<p class="bas indent2"><span class="nm">6.</span><span class="cl">Answer #2 (Rav Zevid):</span> The first Tana says that if the fetus came out cut up <i>and</i> Mesuras, when the majority leaves it is considered born;</p>
<p class="bas indent3"><span class="nm">i.</span>Had it come out headfirst, once the head left it would be considered born (even though it is cut up);</p>
<p class="bas indent3"><span class="nm">ii.</span><span class="cl">Version #1 (Rashi):</span> R. Yosi says that even if it comes out headfirst, the head is considered a birth only if it is born alive.</p>
<p class="bas indent3"><span class="nm">iii.</span><span class="cl">Version #2 (Tosfos):</span> R. Yosi says that when it comes out headfirst, once the essence of life (the majority of the head) leaves, it is born. (end of Version #2)</p>
<p class="bas indent2"><span class="nm">7.</span><span class="cl">Support (Beraisa):</span> If the fetus came out cut up and Mesuras, when the majority leaves it is considered born;</p>
<p class="bas indent3"><span class="nm">i.</span><span class="cl">Inference:</span> Had the head left first, this would have been considered birth;</p>
<p class="bas indent3"><span class="nm">ii.</span>R. Yosi says, when it comes out headfirst (Rashi - and alive), it is considered born after the majority of the head leaves.</p>
<p class="bas indent3"><span class="nm">iii.</span><span class="cl">Question:</span> What is considered the majority of the head?</p>
<p class="bas indent3"><span class="nm">iv.</span><span class="cl">Answer #1 (R. Yosi):</span> Up to the temples is the majority.</p>
<p class="bas indent3"><span class="nm">v.</span><span class="cl">Answer #2 (Aba Chanan):</span> Up to the forehead is the majority.</p>
<p class="bas indent3"><span class="nm">vi.</span><span class="cl">Answer #3:</span> Some say, once the "horns" (the top of the back of the head) are visible (the majority has left).</p>
<p class="bas subject"><span class="nm">2)</span>AN UNKNOWN BIRTH</p>
<p class="bas indent1"><span class="nm">(a)</span><span class="cl">(Mishnah):</span> If a woman miscarried a child, but she does not know the gender, she is Yoledes Zachar or Nekevah;</p>
<p class="bas indent1"><span class="nm">(b)</span>If she does not know whether or not a child came out, she is Safek Yoledes Zachar or Nekevah, Safek Nidah.</p>
<p class="bas indent1"><span class="nm">(c)</span><span class="cl">(Gemara - R. Yehoshua ben Levi):</span> If a woman miscarried in a river, she brings a Korban (like a definite Yoledes). The Chatas is eaten, for we follow the majority:</p>
<p class="bas indent2"><span class="nm">1.</span>Most miscarriages are proper children (for which a Korban is brought).</p>
<p class="bas indent1"><span class="nm">(d)</span><span class="cl">Question (Mishnah):</span> If she does not know whether or not a child came out, she is Safek Yoledes Zachar or Nekevah, Safek Nidah.</p>
<p class="bas indent2"><span class="nm">1.</span>According to R. Yehoshua ben Levi, why is she Safek Nidah? We should follow the majority and say that a child came out!</p>
<p class="bas indent1"><span class="nm">(e)</span><span class="cl">Answer:</span> The case is, she was not known to be pregnant. R. Yehoshua teaches about one who was known to be pregnant.</p>
<p class="bas indent1"><span class="nm">(f)</span><span class="cl">Question (Beraisa):</span> If a pregnant animal (that never gave birth before) wandered off and returned (the same day) empty (not pregnant), if its next child is a male, it is a Safek Bechor.</p>
<p class="bas indent2"><span class="nm">1.</span>According to R. Yehoshua ben Levi, we should follow the majority and say that a child came out from this pregnancy. The next child is definitely not a Bechor!</p>
<p class="bas indent1"><span class="nm">(g)</span><span class="cl">Answer (Ravina):</span> All animals secrete Tinuf (fluids) the day before giving birth. Since this animal did not, this counters the majority that give birth to proper offspring, therefore the next child is a Safek.</p>
<p class="bas indent1"><span class="nm">(h)</span><span class="cl">Objection:</span> If <i>all</i> animals secrete before giving birth, and this one did not, surely it did not give birth!</p>
<p class="bas indent1"><span class="nm">(i)</span><span class="cl">Correction:</span> Rather, <i>most</i> animals secrete before giving birth. Since this animal did not, this counters the majority that give birth to proper offspring, so the next child is Safek.</p>
<p class="bas indent1"><span class="nm">(j)</span><span class="cl">Ravin:</span> R. Yosi b'Rebbi Chanina tried to refute R. Yehoshua ben Levi from the following Beraisa, but it is not a refutation!</p>
<p class="bas bbbline">29b----------------------------------------29b</p>
<p class="bas indent2"><span class="nm">1.</span><span class="cl">Question (R. Yosi b'Rebbi Chanina - Beraisa - Beis Shamai):</span> A pregnant woman left, and returned empty months later. The first three weeks after returning, she did not see blood. The following ten weeks, she alternated. She would see blood for seven straight days, and then have seven clean days, and repeat this. She may have Bi'ah on the 35th night. She immerses 95 times during this period (this will be explained);</p>
<p class="bas indent2"><span class="nm">2.</span>Beis Hillel says, she immerses 35 times;</p>
<p class="bas indent2"><span class="nm">3.</span>R. Yosi b'Rebbi Yehudah says, it suffices for her to immerse once at the end.</p>
<p class="bas indent3"><span class="nm">i.</span>Granted, Bi'ah is forbidden the first week, for even if she gave birth to a male, she is Teme'ah;</p>
<p class="bas indent3"><span class="nm">ii.</span>Bi'ah is forbidden the second week, for perhaps she gave birth to a female.</p>
<p class="bas indent3"><span class="nm">iii.</span>Bi'ah is forbidden the third week, for perhaps she was Yoledes Nekevah b'Zov (when she was a Zavah). The Tana requires her to count seven clean days <i>after</i> the two weeks of Tum'ah.</p>
<p class="bas indent3"><span class="nm">iv.</span><span class="cl">Question:</span> Why is Bi'ah forbidden in the fourth week? Whether she gave birth to a male or female, she already had seven clean days, and the blood she sees is Dam Tohar!</p>
<p class="bas indent3"><span class="nm">v.</span><span class="cl">Answer:</span> This shows that we do not rely on the majority that most women give birth to a proper child. This refutes R. Yehoshua ben Levi!</p>
<p class="bas indent1"><span class="nm">(k)</span><span class="cl">Question:</span> Why did Ravin say that it is not a refutation?</p>
<p class="bas indent1"><span class="nm">(l)</span><span class="cl">Answer:</span> Really, we rely on the majority. However, since we do not know when she gave birth, we are concerned lest Yemei Tohar already ended. (Most Rishonim cannot explain why R. Yosi b'Rebbi Chanina asked the question. The Beraisa makes sense only if we do not know when she gave birth! Ran - most women immediately sense that they miscarried. R. Yosi reasoned, if we do not rely on this majority (rather, we are concerned lest she gave birth many days ago), we should not rely on the majority that most women give birth to a proper child, either. Ravin says that we rely on the latter majority, but not on the former.)</p>
<p class="bas indent1"><span class="nm">(m)</span><span class="cl">Question:</span> Why is Bi'ah forbidden in the fifth week (until night 35)?</p>
<p class="bas indent1"><span class="nm">(n)</span><span class="cl">Answer:</span> It is possible that Yemei Tohar ended on any day of the fourth week (in particular, perhaps on the 27th), and the blood she saw the next day was the beginning of Nidah, therefore the next seven days (until and including the 34th) might be days of Nidah.</p>
<p class="bas indent1"><span class="nm">(o)</span><span class="cl">Question:</span> Why is Bi'ah forbidden on day 21? (Even if she was Yoledes Nekevah b'Zov, she just counted seven clean days!)</p>
<p class="bas indent1"><span class="nm">(p)</span><span class="cl">Answer:</span> The Tana is R. Shimon, who forbids Bi'ah on the seventh clean day, for if she sees blood later that day, it is retroactively revealed that she never counted 7 clean days.</p>
<p class="bas indent1"><span class="nm">(q)</span><span class="cl">Question:</span> Why is Bi'ah forbidden the following night?</p>
<p class="bas indent1"><span class="nm">(r)</span><span class="cl">Answer:</span> The case is, she saw blood at the beginning of the night.</p>
