<p class="bas subject"><span class="nm">1)</span>CAN WE EXPLAIN OUR <i>MISHNAH</i>? (cont.)</p>
<p class="bas indent1"><span class="nm">(a)</span><span class="cl">Suggestion:</span> Perhaps this is a decree lest one do Chalitzah with the first and Yibum with the second (but if Chalitzah was done with the second, the first may do Yibum)!</p>
<p class="bas indent1"><span class="nm">(b)</span><span class="cl">Rejection:</span> 'They do not do Yibum' connotes that it is always forbidden.</p>
<p class="bas indent1"><span class="nm">(c)</span><span class="cl">Suggestion:</span> Perhaps we decree lest the brother who does not do Yibum die, for it is forbidden to Mevatel the Mitzvah of of Yibum!</p>
<p class="bas indent1"><span class="nm">(d)</span><span class="cl">Rejection:</span> R. Yochanan holds that we are not concerned lest one die.</p>
<p class="bas indent1"><span class="nm">(e)</span><span class="cl">Suggestion:</span> Perhaps the Mishnah is R. Eliezer, who says that once a Yevamah became forbidden, she remains forbidden forever!</p>
<p class="bas indent1"><span class="nm">(f)</span><span class="cl">Rejection:</span> Since the Seifa mentions R. Eliezer, he did not teach the Reisha.</p>
<p class="bas indent1"><span class="nm">(g)</span><span class="cl">Suggestion:</span> Perhaps they fell simultaneously, like R. Yosi ha'Galili, who says that this is possible!</p>
<p class="bas indent1"><span class="nm">(h)</span><span class="cl">Rejection:</span> We do not have a Stam Mishnah like R. Yosi ha'Galili.</p>
<p class="bas indent1"><span class="nm">(i)</span><span class="cl">Suggestion:</span> Perhaps we do not know which fell first!</p>
<p class="bas indent1"><span class="nm">(j)</span><span class="cl">Rejection (Seifa):</span> If they both did Yibum, they must divorce their wives.</p>
<p class="bas indent2"><span class="nm">1.</span>Granted, the first to do Yibum must divorce her, for she was forbidden to him.</p>
<p class="bas indent2"><span class="nm">2.</span>Why must the second divorce his wife? He can say that his brother did Yibum with the second, and he did Yibum with the first!</p>
<p class="bas indent1"><span class="nm">(k)</span><span class="cl">Conclusion:</span> This is why R. Yochanan said that he did not know who authored our Mishnah.</p>
<p class="bas indent1"><span class="nm">(l)</span><span class="cl">(Mishnah):</span> If one sister was Ervah to a Yavam (Reuven), he is forbidden to her, and permitted to marry her sister. The other brother is forbidden to both.</p>
<p class="bas indent1"><span class="nm">(m)</span><span class="cl">Assumption:</span> Reuven's (e.g) mother-in-law (i.e. the sister who is Ervah to him) fell first.</p>
<p class="bas indent1"><span class="nm">(n)</span><span class="cl">Question:</span> Reuven can do Yibum with her sister, and his mother-in-law will then be a Yevamah who was permitted (to the other Yavam), forbidden, and permitted again!</p>
<p class="bas indent1"><span class="nm">(o)</span><span class="cl">Answer (Rav Papa):</span> The case is, the other sister fell first.</p>
<p class="bas subject"><span class="nm">2)</span>THE OPINIONS IN THE <i>MISHNAH</i></p>
<p class="bas indent1"><span class="nm">(a)</span><span class="cl">(Mishnah - R. Eliezer):</span> Beis Shamai say (if they did Yibum, they may remain married).</p>
<p class="bas indent1"><span class="nm">(b)</span><span class="cl">(Beraisa - R. Eliezer):</span> Beis Shamai permit them to remain married; Beis Hillel say, they must be divorced;</p>
<p class="bas indent1"><span class="nm">(c)</span>R. Shimon says, they may remain married;</p>
<p class="bas indent1"><span class="nm">(d)</span>Aba Sha'ul says, Beis Hillel are more lenient and permit them to remain married, and Beis Shamai say that they must be divorced.</p>
<p class="bas indent1"><span class="nm">(e)</span><span class="cl">Question:</span> Whose opinion does R. Shimon express?</p>
<p class="bas indent2"><span class="nm">1.</span>If he gives Beis Shamai's opinion, R. Shimon is like R. Eliezer!</p>
<p class="bas indent2"><span class="nm">2.</span>If he gives Beis Hillel's opinion, he is like Aba Sha'ul!</p>
<p class="bas indent1"><span class="nm">(f)</span><span class="cl">Answer:</span> He says that Beis Shamai and Beis Hillel did not argue about this.</p>
<p class="bas subject"><span class="nm">3)</span>WHAT EACH CLAUSE TEACHES</p>
<p class="bas indent1"><span class="nm">(a)</span><span class="cl">(Mishnah):</span> If one was (Ervah to Reuven, he is forbidden to her and permitted to her sister. Shimon is forbidden to both).</p>
<p class="bas indent1"><span class="nm">(b)</span><span class="cl">Question:</span> We learned this in a previous Mishnah!</p>
<p class="bas indent2"><span class="nm">1.</span><span class="cl">(Mishnah):</span> A woman who falls to Yibum with her sister (who is Ervah to the Yavam) does Chalitzah or Yibum.</p>
<p class="bas indent1"><span class="nm">(c)</span><span class="cl">Answer:</span> Both Mishnayos are needed.</p>
<p class="bas indent2"><span class="nm">1.</span>In that Mishnah there is only one Yavam. Here, one might have thought that we forbid Yibum, lest Shimon (who is not related to either Yevamah) do Yibum.</p>
<p class="bas indent2"><span class="nm">2.</span>In our Mishnah, Shimon must do Chalitzah, so this shows that Achos Zekukaso is forbidden. There, there is no other brother, so one might have thought that we forbid Yibum lest people think that Achos Zekukaso is permitted.</p>
<p class="bas indent1"><span class="nm">(d)</span><span class="cl">(Mishnah):</span> If one was forbidden due to an Isur Mitzvah (or Isur Kedushah, she does Chalitzah but not Yibum).</p>
<p class="bas bbbline">28b----------------------------------------28b</p>
<p class="bas indent1"><span class="nm">(e)</span><span class="cl">Question:</span> We already learned this in another Mishnah!</p>
<p class="bas indent2"><span class="nm">1.</span><span class="cl">(Mishnah):</span> If she is forbidden because of Mitzvah or Kedushah, she does Chalitzah, but not Yibum.</p>
<p class="bas indent1"><span class="nm">(f)</span><span class="cl">Answer:</span> There, Leah fell alone to Yibum. Here, her sister Rachel fell with her;</p>
<p class="bas indent2"><span class="nm">1.</span>One might have thought Chachamim consider an Isur Mitzvah to be like Ervah to allow Rachel to do Yibum. Our Mishnah teaches that it does not.</p>
<p class="bas indent2"><span class="nm">2.</span><span class="cl">Question:</span> What is the reason?</p>
<p class="bas indent2"><span class="nm">3.</span><span class="cl">Answer:</span> Since mid'Oraisa Leah falls to Yibum, Rachel is forbidden due to Achos Zekukaso.</p>
<p class="bas indent1"><span class="nm">(g)</span><span class="cl">(Mishnah):</span> If one sister was Ervah to one Yavam, and the other was Ervah to the other, each Yavam may do Yibum with the Yevamah who is not Ervah to him.</p>
<p class="bas indent1"><span class="nm">(h)</span><span class="cl">Question:</span> We already learned this in the Reisha! What difference does it make if only one is Ervah to a Yavam, or if each is Ervah to a different Yavam?!</p>
<p class="bas indent1"><span class="nm">(i)</span><span class="cl">Answer:</span> Had it taught only about when only one is Ervah, we would have thought that only there Yibum is allowed. Since the other Yevamah must do Chalitzah, this shows that Achos Zekukaso is forbidden (but here we would decree to forbid Yibum, lest people think that Achos Zekukaso is permitted);</p>
<p class="bas indent2"><span class="nm">1.</span>Had it taught only about when each is Ervah, we would have thought that only then Yibum is allowed. Since each Yavam is forbidden to a Yevamah, people realize that there is no Achos Zekukaso, due to Ervah. However, when there is only one Ervah, perhaps we decree not to do Yibum.</p>
<p class="bas indent1"><span class="nm">(j)</span><span class="cl">(Mishnah):</span> This is the case in which the sister (of Ervah), who also falls to Yibum, may do Chalitzah or Yibum.</p>
<p class="bas indent1"><span class="nm">(k)</span><span class="cl">Question:</span> What does this come to exclude?</p>
<p class="bas indent1"><span class="nm">(l)</span><span class="cl">Answer:</span> It excludes when each sister is an Isur Mitzvah to a different Yavam.</p>
<p class="bas indent1"><span class="nm">(m)</span><span class="cl">Question:</span> We already learned about when one is an Isur Mitzvah to a Yavam. Surely this is the same!</p>
<p class="bas indent1"><span class="nm">(n)</span><span class="cl">Answer:</span> We might have thought that there we do not consider the Isur like Ervah, lest the other Yevamah do Yibum (and she is Achos Zekukaso). Here, we would consider each Isur Mitzvah to be Ervah, and each may do Yibum with the other Yavam;</p>
<p class="bas indent2"><span class="nm">1.</span>The Mishnah teaches that this is not so.</p>
<p class="bas subject"><span class="nm">4)</span>SISTERS WHO FALL TO <i>YIBUM</i> TOGETHER</p>
<p class="bas indent1"><span class="nm">(a)</span><span class="cl">(Rav Yehudah citing Rav):</span> For every Ervah (in the Mishnah (2a)), we can find that the Yevamah forbidden to one Yavam due to that Ervah is permitted to the other Yavam; and when they are sisters (falling from different brothers), they do Chalitzah or Yibum.</p>
<p class="bas indent2"><span class="nm">1.</span>Rav Yehudah himself applies this only to the Arayos starting with one's mother-in-law.</p>
<p class="bas indent2"><span class="nm">2.</span>He does not apply this to the first six Arayos, since (they are branches of the Isur of Bito, and) the case of Bito is only found through rape, but not through marriage. The Tana does not discuss such cases.</p>
<p class="bas indent1"><span class="nm">(b)</span>Abaye says that even Bito is included, even though it does not arise through marriage.</p>
<p class="bas indent2"><span class="nm">1.</span>Abaye excludes Eshes Achiv she'Lo Hayah b'Olamo, since it arises only according to R. Shimon;</p>
<p class="bas indent2"><span class="nm">2.</span>The Tana does not discuss cases subject to dispute.</p>
<p class="bas indent1"><span class="nm">(c)</span>Rav Safra includes even this case. It arises with six brothers, according to R. Shimon.</p>
<p class="bas indent2"><span class="nm">1.</span>A way to remember the case is 'Died, was born, did Yibum; died, was born, did Yibum'.</p>
<p class="bas indent2"><span class="nm">2.</span>Reuven and Shimon were married to two sisters; Levi and Yehudah were married to two unrelated women. Reuven died, Yisachar was born, Levi did Yibum; Shimon died, Zevulun was born, and Yehudah did Yibum. Levi and Yehudah died without children.</p>
<p class="bas indent1"><span class="nm">(d)</span>Reuven's widow is forbidden to Yisachar and Shimon's widow is forbidden to Zevulun; they are sisters.</p>
<p class="bas indent1"><span class="nm">(e)</span><span class="cl">Question:</span> This is true even if Yehudah didn't do Yibum!</p>
<p class="bas indent1"><span class="nm">(f)</span><span class="cl">Answer:</span> We discuss when Yehudah did Yibum so that each Tzarah will be permitted to a different brother.</p>
<p class="bas indent1"><span class="nm">(g)</span><span class="cl">Question:</span> This shows that the case applies to a Tzarah. How can it apply to Tzaras Tzarah?</p>
<p class="bas indent1"><span class="nm">(h)</span><span class="cl">Answer:</span> Later, Gad and Asher (other brothers) did Yibum with the Tzaros.</p>
<p class="bas indent1"><span class="nm">(i)</span><span class="cl">(Mishnah):</span> If two of three brothers were married to sisters, or to a woman and her daughter or granddaughter; (if the two brothers die) the Yevamos do Chalitzah but not Yibum;</p>
<p class="bas indent1"><span class="nm">(j)</span>R. Shimon says, there is no need for Chalitzah.</p>
<p class="bas indent1"><span class="nm">(k)</span>If one of the sisters was forbidden to a Yavam due to Ervah, he is forbidden to her and permitted to her sister;</p>
<p class="bas indent1"><span class="nm">(l)</span>If one of the sisters was forbidden to a Yavam because of Isur Mitzvah or Kedushah, they do Chalitzah, but not Yibum.</p>
<p class="bas indent1"><span class="nm">(m)</span><span class="cl">(Gemara - Beraisa):</span> R. Shimon exempts from Yibum and Chalitzah - "Do not marry a woman with her sister to be rivals" - when they are rivals to each other (both fell to Yibum to the same brother), you cannot marry even one of them.</p>
<p class="bas indent1"><span class="nm">(n)</span><span class="cl">(Mishnah):</span> If one of them was forbidden because of Ervah...</p>
<p class="bas indent1"><span class="nm">(o)</span><span class="cl">Question:</span> We already learned this (in the first Mishnah of our Perek)!</p>
<p class="bas indent1"><span class="nm">(p)</span><span class="cl">Answer:</span> It is taught to teach R. Shimon's opinion (that he agrees);</p>
<p class="bas indent2"><span class="nm">1.</span>(When neither sister is Ervah to a brother,) R. Shimon forbids sisters to do Yibum. One might have thought that we should decree when one is Ervah due to when neither is.</p>
