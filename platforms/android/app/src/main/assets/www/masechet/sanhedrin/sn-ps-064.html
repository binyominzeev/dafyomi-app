<p class="bas subject"><span class="nm">1)</span>ABOLITION OF THE <i>YETZER HA'RA</i> FOR IDOLATRY</p>
<p class="bas indent1"><span class="nm">(a)</span><span class="cl">Answer:</span> After they were steeped in idolatry, they felt attached to it.</p>
<p class="bas indent1"><span class="nm">(b)</span><span class="cl">Question:</span> It says "va'Yiz'aku b'Kol Gadol El Hash-m";</p>
<p class="bas indent2"><span class="nm">1.</span><span class="cl">Question:</span> What did they (Anshei Keneses ha'Gedolah, the Great Assembly) say?</p>
<p class="bas indent2"><span class="nm">2.</span><span class="cl">Answer (Rav Yehudah):</span> They moaned 'the Yetzer ha'Ra (evil inclination for idolatry) caused the destruction of the Beis ha'Mikdash and the Heichal, the killing of Tzadikim, the exile of Yisrael from Eretz Yisrael, and it still wreaks havoc among us. You (Hash-m) gave to us the Yetzer ha'Ra only to overcome it and receive reward. We prefer not to have it, nor its reward!'</p>
<p class="bas indent1"><span class="nm">(c)</span><span class="cl">Answer:</span> After they were steeped in idolatry, they lusted to serve it.</p>
<p class="bas indent1"><span class="nm">(d)</span><span class="cl">(Rav Yehudah):</span> They fasted for three days and asked Hash-m to hand the Yetzer ha'Ra over to them. A note fell from Shamayim. It said 'Emes.'</p>
<p class="bas indent2"><span class="nm">1.</span><span class="cl">(R. Chanina):</span> This teaches that Hash-m's stamp is 'Emes.'</p>
<p class="bas indent1"><span class="nm">(e)</span>A lion of fire came out from the Kodesh ha'Kodoshim; Zecharyah told them that it is the Yetzer ha'Ra. They seized it. A hair came out. It roared, and it was heard for 400 Parsa'os. They were concerned lest Hash-m had mercy on it.</p>
<p class="bas indent2"><span class="nm">1.</span><span class="cl">Zecharyah:</span> Throw it in a lead pot and cover it with lead - "Zos ha'Rish'ah va'Yashlech Osah El Toch ha'Eifah... Oferes Al Piha."</p>
<p class="bas indent2"><span class="nm">2.</span>Since they were granted this, they requested the Yetzer ha'Ra for Arayos. Hash-m agreed. They held it for three days.</p>
<p class="bas indent2"><span class="nm">3.</span>A fresh egg was needed for a sick person, and it could not be found. (Hens were not laying even eggs finished inside the hen.)</p>
<p class="bas indent2"><span class="nm">4.</span>They reasoned that Hash-m would not consent to remove only half the Yetzer (for what is permitted). They blinded it. This helped that people would not lust for their relatives.</p>
<p class="bas indent1"><span class="nm">(f)</span><span class="cl">(Rav Yehudah):</span> A case occurred in which a Nochris was very sick. She said that if she recovers, she will serve every idolatry in the world. She recovered and went to serve every idolatry. When she came to Ba'al Pe'or, she asked its priests how to serve it.</p>
<p class="bas indent2"><span class="nm">1.</span><span class="cl">The priests:</span> Eat beets and drink beer (these induce bowel movement) and excrete in front of it.</p>
<p class="bas indent2"><span class="nm">2.</span><span class="cl">The woman:</span> It is better to be sick than to do so!</p>
<p class="bas indent1"><span class="nm">(g)</span><span class="cl">(Rav Yehudah):</span> Yisrael sunk lower than this Nochris! "Ha'Ni<i>tzmad</i>im l'Ba'al Pe'or" - Yisrael clung to Ba'al Pe'or like a Tzamid Pasil (a tightly sealed container);</p>
<p class="bas indent2"><span class="nm">1.</span>"V'Atem ha'Devekim ba'Shem" - they clung to Hash-m like dates (that do not cling to each other so tightly).</p>
<p class="bas indent1"><span class="nm">(h)</span><span class="cl">(Beraisa):</span> "Ha'Nitzmadim l'Ba'al Pe'or" - like a Tzamid (bracelet) on a woman's hand (that does not cling);</p>
<p class="bas indent2"><span class="nm">1.</span>"V'Atem ha'Devekim ba'Shem" - truly clinging.</p>
<p class="bas indent1"><span class="nm">(i)</span><span class="cl">(Beraisa):</span> A case occurred in which Savta ben Eles rented a donkey to a Nochris. When she came to Ba'al Pe'or, she went to serve it. Afterwards, he told her that he wants to serve it.</p>
<p class="bas indent2"><span class="nm">1.</span><span class="cl">The woman:</span> Aren't you a Yisrael?!</p>
<p class="bas indent2"><span class="nm">2.</span><span class="cl">Savta:</span> What difference does it make?</p>
<p class="bas indent2"><span class="nm">3.</span>He excreted in front of it, and wiped his rectum with its nose. The priests were ecstatic - 'no one ever served like this before!'</p>
<p class="bas indent1"><span class="nm">(j)</span>Excreting in front of Ba'al Pe'or is its normal Avodah. One is liable (Rambam - a Korban, if he was Shogeg; Rashi - and if he was Mezid and warned, Misah) even though he intends to disgrace it (Tosfos - to serve it through disgrace). Throwing rocks at Markulis is its Avodah. He is liable even if he intends to stone it.</p>
<p class="bas indent1"><span class="nm">(k)</span>Rav Menasheh was traveling. They told him 'there is idolatry here.' He threw a clod of earth at it. They told him that it was Markulis.</p>
<p class="bas indent2"><span class="nm">1.</span><span class="cl">Rav Menasheh:</span> The Mishnah forbids only throwing rocks <i>to</i> Markulis, i.e. to honor it!</p>
<p class="bas indent2"><span class="nm">2.</span><span class="cl">Rabanan:</span> The Mishnah forbids throwing rocks <i>at</i> Markulis, even if he intends to stone it.</p>
<p class="bas indent2"><span class="nm">3.</span><span class="cl">Rav Menasheh:</span> I will remove what I threw (lest it be adorned by my act)!</p>
<p class="bas indent2"><span class="nm">4.</span><span class="cl">Rabanan:</span> One is liable for taking rocks from or throwing rocks at Markulis (Rambam - both of these are ways of serving it);</p>
<p class="bas indent3"><span class="nm">i.</span>One who takes away makes room for others to throw.</p>
<p class="bas subject"><span class="nm">2)</span>SERVING <i>MOLECH</i></p>
<p class="bas indent1"><span class="nm">(a)</span><span class="cl">(Mishnah):</span> To be liable for giving a child to Molech, he must give his child to (the priests of) Molech and pass him through a fire;</p>
<p class="bas indent2"><span class="nm">1.</span>If he only gave his child to Molech, or only passed him through a fire, he is exempt.</p>
<p class="bas indent1"><span class="nm">(b)</span><span class="cl">(Gemara) Question:</span> Another Mishnah teaches about liability for idolatry!</p>
<p class="bas indent1"><span class="nm">(c)</span><span class="cl">Answer (R. Avin):</span> Our Tana holds that Molech is not idolatry. (Rather, it is a forbidden ritual for which one is stoned.)</p>
<p class="bas indent2"><span class="nm">1.</span><span class="cl">(Beraisa):</span> If one gives a child to Molech or to any other idolatry and passes him through a fire, he is liable;</p>
<p class="bas indent2"><span class="nm">2.</span>R. Elazar b'Rebbi Shimon says, he is liable for Molech, but not for any other idolatry.</p>
<p class="bas indent1"><span class="nm">(d)</span><span class="cl">(Abaye):</span> R. Elazar b'Rebbi Shimon and R. Chanina ben Antigonus agree with each other.</p>
<p class="bas indent2"><span class="nm">1.</span><span class="cl">(R. Chanina ben Antigonus):</span> The Torah says Molech because people were Mamlich (crowned) it upon themselves. It can be anything, even a pebble or chip of wood.</p>
<p class="bas indent1"><span class="nm">(e)</span><span class="cl">(Rava):</span> R. Elazar and R. Chanina argue about a temporary Molech (such as a pebble or chip, which is not likely to be served again. R. Shimon exempts for it.)</p>
<p class="bas bbbline">64b----------------------------------------64b</p>
<p class="bas indent1"><span class="nm">(f)</span><span class="cl">(R. Yanai):</span> He is not liable until he gives his child to the priests of Molech and passes him through a fire - "umi'Zar'acha Lo Siten Leha'avir la'Molech." (He explains that when the Mishnah discusses giving to Molech, it means to the priests.)</p>
<p class="bas indent1"><span class="nm">(g)</span><span class="cl">Support (Beraisa) Suggestion:</span> Perhaps one is liable for passing a child through a fire, without giving him to the priests!</p>
<p class="bas indent2"><span class="nm">1.</span><span class="cl">Rejection:</span> "Lo Siten."</p>
<p class="bas indent2"><span class="nm">2.</span><span class="cl">Suggestion:</span> Perhaps one is liable for giving a child to the priests, without passing him through a fire!</p>
<p class="bas indent2"><span class="nm">3.</span><span class="cl">Rejection:</span> It says "Leha'avir."</p>
<p class="bas indent2"><span class="nm">4.</span><span class="cl">Suggestion:</span> Perhaps one is liable for giving him to the priests and passing him through a fire to an idolatry other than Molech!</p>
<p class="bas indent2"><span class="nm">5.</span><span class="cl">Rejection:</span> It says "la'Molech."</p>
<p class="bas indent2"><span class="nm">6.</span><span class="cl">Suggestion:</span> Perhaps one is liable for giving him to the priests and passing him to Molech, but not through a fire!</p>
<p class="bas indent2"><span class="nm">7.</span><span class="cl">Rejection:</span> It says here "Leha'avir", and it says "Ma'avir Beno u'Vito ba'Esh." Just like there it refers to fire, also here. Just like here it refers to Molech, also there.</p>
<p class="bas indent1"><span class="nm">(h)</span><span class="cl">(Rav Acha brei d'Rava):</span> If one gave all his children (to the priests of Molech and passes them) through a fire, he is exempt - "u<i>mi</i>'Zar'acha", and not all your children.</p>
<p class="bas indent1"><span class="nm">(i)</span><span class="cl">Questions (Rav Ashi):</span> What is the law if one gave a child that is blind, sleeping, or the son of his son or daughter?</p>
<p class="bas indent1"><span class="nm">(j)</span><span class="cl">Answer (to one of these - Beraisa) Question:</span> What do we learn from "Ki mi'Zar'o Nosan la'Molech"?</p>
<p class="bas indent2"><span class="nm">1.</span><span class="cl">Answer - Suggestion:</span> Perhaps "Lo Yimatzei Becha Ma'avir Beno u'Vito ba'Esh" obligates only for his own son or daughter!</p>
<p class="bas indent2"><span class="nm">2.</span><span class="cl">Rejection:</span> "B'Sito mi'Zar'o" obligates even for a grandson.</p>
<p class="bas indent2"><span class="nm">3.</span><span class="cl">Question:</span> The Tana asked what we learn from "Ki mi'Zar'o...", and he answered with a Drashah from a different verse, "b'Sito mi'Zar'o"!</p>
<p class="bas indent2"><span class="nm">4.</span><span class="cl">Answer:</span> Really, "Ki mi'Zar'o" obligates even for a grandson. "B'Sito mi'Zar'o" teaches something else:</p>
<p class="bas indent3"><span class="nm">i.</span><span class="cl">Suggestion:</span> Perhaps "(Ki) mi'Zar'o" obligates only for legitimate children!</p>
<p class="bas indent3"><span class="nm">ii.</span><span class="cl">Rejection:</span> "B'Sito mi'Zar'o" obligates even for illegitimate children.</p>
<p class="bas indent1"><span class="nm">(k)</span><span class="cl">(Rav Yehudah):</span> He is liable only for passing through in the normal way (of Molech).</p>
<p class="bas indent1"><span class="nm">(l)</span><span class="cl">Question:</span> What is this?</p>
<p class="bas indent1"><span class="nm">(m)</span><span class="cl">Answer #1 (Abaye):</span> He passes his child along a brick wall, with a fire on each side of it.</p>
<p class="bas indent1"><span class="nm">(n)</span><span class="cl">Answer #2 (Rava):</span> He makes the child jump over a fire in a pit, like children jump on Purim.</p>
<p class="bas indent1"><span class="nm">(o)</span><span class="cl">Support (for Rava - Beraisa):</span> He is liable only for passing through in the normal way;</p>
<p class="bas indent2"><span class="nm">1.</span>If he made him walk across, he is exempt.</p>
<p class="bas indent2"><span class="nm">2.</span>He is liable only for his own descendants:</p>
<p class="bas indent3"><span class="nm">i.</span>He is liable for (giving and passing ) a son or daughter. He is exempt for a parent, sibling or for himself.</p>
<p class="bas indent3"><span class="nm">ii.</span>R. Elazar bar Shimon obligates for giving and passing oneself.</p>
<p class="bas indent2"><span class="nm">3.</span>He is liable for giving and passing to Molech or to any other idolatry;</p>
<p class="bas indent2"><span class="nm">4.</span>R. Elazar b'Rebbi Shimon says, he is liable only for Molech.</p>
<p class="bas indent1"><span class="nm">(p)</span><span class="cl">(Ula):</span> R. Elazar bar Shimon (who obligates for oneself) learns from "Lo Yimatzei <i>Becha</i>" - yourself.</p>
<p class="bas indent1"><span class="nm">(q)</span><span class="cl">Question:</span> Also Chachamim expound 'Becha'!</p>
<p class="bas indent2"><span class="nm">1.</span><span class="cl">(Mishnah):</span> If Reuven sees his lost object and his father's, and he cannot save both, he should save his own.</p>
<p class="bas indent2"><span class="nm">2.</span><span class="cl">Question:</span> What is the reason?</p>
<p class="bas indent2"><span class="nm">3.</span><span class="cl">Answer (Rav Yehudah):</span> "Efes Ki Lo Yihyeh Becha Evyon" (do not allow yourself to become poor) - save your lost object before anyone else's.</p>
<p class="bas indent1"><span class="nm">(r)</span><span class="cl">Answer:</span> There we expound "Efes" (this word is extra), and not "Becha."</p>
<p class="bas subject"><span class="nm">3)</span>THE PUNISHMENTS OF <i>KARES</i> REGARDING IDOLATRY</p>
<p class="bas indent1"><span class="nm">(a)</span><span class="cl">Question (R. Yosi b'Rebbi Chanina):</span> Why does the Torah say three times that one is Chayav Kares for idolatry (once regarding idolatry in general, and twice regarding Molech)?</p>
<p class="bas indent1"><span class="nm">(b)</span><span class="cl">Answer:</span> One obligates Kares for serving k'Darko, one obligates for Lo k'Darko, and one is Mechayev for Molech.</p>
<p class="bas indent1"><span class="nm">(c)</span><span class="cl">Question:</span> According to the opinion that Molech is an idolatry, what do we learn from the third?</p>
<p class="bas indent1"><span class="nm">(d)</span><span class="cl">Answer:</span> It obligates for passing one's child to a different idolatry.</p>
<p class="bas indent1"><span class="nm">(e)</span>(Tana'im argue about whether "Megadef" refers to blasphemy or idolatry.)</p>
<p class="bas indent1"><span class="nm">(f)</span><span class="cl">Question:</span> According to the opinion that Megadef refers to idolatry, what do we learn from the Kares written regarding it?</p>
<p class="bas indent1"><span class="nm">(g)</span><span class="cl">Answer (Beraisa - R. Akiva):</span> "Hikares Tikares" - he will be cut off from this world and the next;</p>
<p class="bas indent1"><span class="nm">(h)</span><span class="cl">R. Yishmael:</span> It already says "v'Nichresa." Is there a third world?!</p>
<p class="bas indent2"><span class="nm">1.</span>Rather, "v'Nichresa" - he will be cut off from this world. "Hikares" - he will be cut off from the next world. "Tikares" - the Torah speaks like people do (we need not expound the extra word).</p>
