<p class="bas subject"><span class="nm">1)</span>RIGHTS OF VISITORS TO SELL</p>
<p class="bas indent1"><span class="nm">(a)</span><span class="cl">(Rav Nachman bar Yitzchak):</span> Rav Huna admits that peddlers of the city cannot prevent traveling peddlers from selling their wares.</p>
<p class="bas indent2"><span class="nm">1.</span>Ezra enacted that peddlers may go from city to city in order that cosmetics will be readily available to women.</p>
<p class="bas indent1"><span class="nm">(b)</span>They are allowed to go around the city and sell, but they may not fix a place to sell;</p>
<p class="bas indent2"><span class="nm">1.</span>A Chacham is allowed to fix a place.</p>
<p class="bas indent1"><span class="nm">(c)</span>Rava allowed R. Yoshiyah and Rav Ovadyah to fix a place;</p>
<p class="bas indent2"><span class="nm">1.</span>This is not (normally) the Halachah.</p>
<p class="bas indent1"><span class="nm">(d)</span><span class="cl">Question:</span> Why did he allow them?</p>
<p class="bas indent1"><span class="nm">(e)</span><span class="cl">Answer:</span> It was so they should not lose time from learning.</p>
<p class="bas indent1"><span class="nm">(f)</span>People selling baskets (some say - pots) came to Bavel. People of the city came to stop them.</p>
<p class="bas indent2"><span class="nm">1.</span><span class="cl">Ravina:</span> They came from elsewhere. They may sell to people from elsewhere who come on the market day;</p>
<p class="bas indent2"><span class="nm">2.</span>They may sell only in the market. They may not go around the city.</p>
<p class="bas indent1"><span class="nm">(g)</span>People selling wool came to Pum Nahara. People of the city came to stop them.</p>
<p class="bas indent2"><span class="nm">1.</span><span class="cl">Rav Kahana:</span> They may stop you.</p>
<p class="bas indent2"><span class="nm">2.</span><span class="cl">The sellers:</span> We sold on credit. We must tarry here to collect the money (and we must sell for our livelihood)!</p>
<p class="bas indent2"><span class="nm">3.</span><span class="cl">Rav Kahana:</span> You may sell what is needed for your livelihood, but only for the time needed to collect your money.</p>
<p class="bas indent1"><span class="nm">(h)</span>Rav Dimi of Neharde'a brought dried figs on a ship.</p>
<p class="bas indent2"><span class="nm">1.</span><span class="cl">The Reish Galusa (the executive head of Yisrael in exile, to Rava):</span> See if he is a Chacham. If he is, give to him exclusive rights to sell figs.</p>
<p class="bas indent2"><span class="nm">2.</span>Rava told Rav Ada bar Aba to test him.</p>
<p class="bas indent2"><span class="nm">3.</span><span class="cl">Rav Ada:</span> If an elephant swallowed a basket, and excreted it, does it still receive Tum'ah (or is it Tahor, like Kelim of dung)?</p>
<p class="bas indent2"><span class="nm">4.</span>Rav Dimi did not know. Rav Ada teased him, and did not give to him exclusive rights to sell figs. The figs spoiled.</p>
<p class="bas indent2"><span class="nm">5.</span>Rav Dimi complained to Rav Yosef.</p>
<p class="bas indent2"><span class="nm">6.</span><span class="cl">Rav Yosef:</span> Hash-m avenged the injustice done to the king of Edom. He will avenge your affliction.</p>
<p class="bas indent3"><span class="nm">i.</span>"Pish'ei Mo'av... Lo Ashivenu" - they will be punished for burning the bones of the king of Edom.</p>
<p class="bas indent2"><span class="nm">7.</span>Rav Ada died.</p>
<p class="bas indent2"><span class="nm">8.</span><span class="cl">Rav Yosef:</span> I am responsible, for I cursed him!</p>
<p class="bas indent2"><span class="nm">9.</span><span class="cl">Rav Dimi:</span> I am responsible. He was punished for the loss of my figs.</p>
<p class="bas indent2"><span class="nm">10.</span><span class="cl">Abaye:</span> I am responsible. He used to tell people 'rather than learn without satisfaction from Abaye, learn from Rava!'</p>
<p class="bas indent2"><span class="nm">11.</span><span class="cl">Rava:</span> I am responsible. He used to tell butchers that he will buy before my servant, for he is greater.</p>
<p class="bas indent2"><span class="nm">12.</span><span class="cl">Rav Nachman bar Yitzchak:</span> I am responsible.</p>
<p class="bas indent3"><span class="nm">i.</span>Rav Nachman bar Yitzchak used to expound on Shabbos. Beforehand, he would review with Rav Ada. One day Rav Ada was detained by Rav Papa and Rav Huna brei d'Rav Yehoshua, who wanted to hear teachings of Rava that they had missed. The Talmidim asked Rav Nachman to begin.</p>
<p class="bas indent3"><span class="nm">ii.</span><span class="cl">Rav Nachman:</span> I am waiting for the casket of Rav Ada.</p>
<p class="bas indent3"><span class="nm">iii.</span>Word spread that Rav Ada died.</p>
<p class="bas indent2"><span class="nm">13.</span>Presumably, Rav Nachman bar Yitzchak was responsible.</p>
<p class="bas subject"><span class="nm">2)</span>BUILDING WALLS NEAR WALLS</p>
<p class="bas indent1"><span class="nm">(a)</span><span class="cl">(Mishnah):</span> If Reuven's wall was near Shimon's wall (and it fell), he may not build another wall within four Amos.</p>
<p class="bas indent1"><span class="nm">(b)</span>If Reuven wants to build a wall opposite Shimon's window, the wall must be at least four Amos higher than or four Amos lower than the window, and (if it is higher) at least four Amos away from the window.</p>
<p class="bas indent1"><span class="nm">(c)</span><span class="cl">(Gemara):</span> How was he allowed to build the first wall so close?</p>
<p class="bas indent1"><span class="nm">(d)</span><span class="cl">Answer #1 (Rav Yehudah):</span> The Mishnah (does not discuss a wall that fell, rather it) says that he may not build a wall within four Amos.</p>
<p class="bas bbbline">22b----------------------------------------22b</p>
<p class="bas indent1"><span class="nm">(e)</span><span class="cl">Objection (Rava):</span> The Mishnah says that he had a wall close to Shimon's wall!</p>
<p class="bas indent1"><span class="nm">(f)</span><span class="cl">Answer #2 (Rava):</span> The Mishnah says, if Reuven's wall was four Amos away from Shimon's wall and it fell, he may not rebuild it within four Amos.</p>
<p class="bas indent2"><span class="nm">1.</span><span class="cl">Question:</span> What is the reason?</p>
<p class="bas indent2"><span class="nm">2.</span><span class="cl">Answer:</span> We want people to walk on the ground in between, this hardens the ground and strengthens the walls.</p>
<p class="bas indent1"><span class="nm">(g)</span><span class="cl">(Rav):</span> The Mishnah only discusses a wall of a garden;</p>
<p class="bas indent2"><span class="nm">1.</span>One may build a wall within four Amos of a wall of a Chatzer.</p>
<p class="bas indent1"><span class="nm">(h)</span><span class="cl">(R. Oshaya):</span> The Mishnah discusses a wall of a garden or of a Chatzer.</p>
<p class="bas indent1"><span class="nm">(i)</span><span class="cl">(R. Yosi b'Rebbi Chanina):</span> Rav and R. Oshaya do not argue;</p>
<p class="bas indent2"><span class="nm">1.</span>Rav discusses an old city, in which the ground near the Chatzer walls is already hard (from years of trampling);</p>
<p class="bas indent2"><span class="nm">2.</span>R. Oshaya discusses a new city, in which even the ground near the Chatzer walls is soft.</p>
<p class="bas indent1"><span class="nm">(j)</span><span class="cl">Question (Mishnah):</span> If Reuven wants to build a wall near Shimon's window, the wall must be at least four Amos taller than or four Amos lower than the window, and at least four Amos away from the window.</p>
<p class="bas indent2"><span class="nm">1.</span><span class="cl">(Beraisa):</span> If it is taller, it must be enough taller so that he cannot crouch down from his wall and look into the window. If it is lower, it must be low enough so he cannot stand on his wall and see through the window. It must be far enough away, so it will not block light.</p>
<p class="bas indent2"><span class="nm">2.</span><span class="cl">Inference:</span> We are concerned only for blocking light, but not for trampling!</p>
<p class="bas indent1"><span class="nm">(k)</span><span class="cl">Answer:</span> The case is, the wall is perpendicular to the existing wall. (Rashi - it inhibits treading only on a minute portion, i.e. the thickness of the new wall. Rashash - people will not walk near the old wall if they must then go around the new wall! Rather, if there was just enough room between the walls to squeeze through, people would do so for a shortcut, since it is cramped only for the thickness of the new wall.)</p>
<p class="bas indent1"><span class="nm">(l)</span><span class="cl">Question:</span> The Beraisa did not say how far away the wall must be so that it will not block light!</p>
<p class="bas indent1"><span class="nm">(m)</span><span class="cl">(Rav Yeiva):</span> One must distance the wall the width of the window.</p>
<p class="bas indent1"><span class="nm">(n)</span><span class="cl">Question:</span> (Because it is close, even if it is higher,) Reuven will be able to look into the window!</p>
<p class="bas indent1"><span class="nm">(o)</span><span class="cl">Answer (Rav Zevid):</span> The case is, Reuven slopes his wall so he cannot stand or lean on it.</p>
<p class="bas indent1"><span class="nm">(p)</span><span class="cl">Question:</span> The Mishnah says that he must distance four Amos!</p>
<p class="bas indent1"><span class="nm">(q)</span><span class="cl">Answer:</span> That is when he builds walls on both sides of the window;</p>
<p class="bas indent2"><span class="nm">1.</span>If he only builds on one side, the width of the window suffices.</p>
<p class="bas indent1"><span class="nm">(r)</span><span class="cl">Question (Mishnah):</span> One must distance a wall four Amos from a gutterpipe, in order that a ladder can be set up (to fix the pipe).</p>
<p class="bas indent2"><span class="nm">1.</span><span class="cl">Inference:</span> We are concerned only for the pipe, but not for trampling!</p>
<p class="bas indent1"><span class="nm">(s)</span><span class="cl">Answer:</span> The case is, the pipe is (on a roof that is) inclined (and extends past the wall). There is room to walk underneath (the roof and next to the wall), therefore he must leave room only for the ladder.</p>
<p class="bas subject"><span class="nm">3)</span>BEING A CAUSE OF DAMAGE</p>
<p class="bas indent1"><span class="nm">(a)</span><span class="cl">(Mishnah):</span> One must distance a ladder four Amos from a dovecote, in order that a marten (a weasel-like animal) cannot jump from it;</p>
<p class="bas indent1"><span class="nm">(b)</span>One must distance a wall four Amos from a gutterpipe, in order that a ladder can be set up.</p>
<p class="bas indent1"><span class="nm">(c)</span><span class="cl">(Gemara) Suggestion:</span> Our Mishnah is not R. Yosi.</p>
<p class="bas indent2"><span class="nm">1.</span><span class="cl">R. Yosi:</span> says that each neighbor may dig or plant in his own property (he need not worry that damage will result to his neighbor).</p>
<p class="bas indent1"><span class="nm">(d)</span><span class="cl">Rejection:</span> Even R. Yosi agrees to our Mishnah.</p>
<p class="bas indent2"><span class="nm">1.</span><span class="cl">(Rav Ashi):</span> R. Yosi admits regarding 'arrows' (i.e. damage that comes directly from the person's hand);</p>
<p class="bas indent2"><span class="nm">2.</span>Here also, sometimes as he erects the ladder, the marten jumps from it.</p>
<p class="bas indent1"><span class="nm">(e)</span><span class="cl">Question:</span> This is only Grama (causation. We do not obligate for damage through Grama!)</p>
<p class="bas indent1"><span class="nm">(f)</span><span class="cl">Answer (Rav Tuvi bar Masnah):</span> This teaches that Grama of damage is forbidden.</p>
