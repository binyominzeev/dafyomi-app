<div class="subject"><span class="nm">1)</span><p>MISHNAH: MUKTZAH AS APPLIED TO GATHERING CUT WOOD</p></div>
<div class="indent1"><span class="nm">(a)</span><p><span class="cl">(R. Yehudah):</span> One may bring wood from the field which was gathered before Yom Tov, and from a Karfaf even if it was not, provided it is near the city.</p></div>
<div class="indent1"><span class="nm">(b)</span><p><span class="cl">(R. Yosi):</span> One may bring wood even a distance Karfaf, if guarded, provided that it is within the Techum Shabbos.</p></div>
<div class="subject"><span class="nm">2)</span><p>THE STRINGENT POSITION OF SHMUEL</p></div>
<div class="indent1"><span class="nm">(a)</span><p><span class="cl">(R. Yehudah citing Shmuel):</span> One may bring wood only from that which is pre-gathered <i>and</i> in a Karfaf.</p></div>
<div class="indent1"><span class="nm">(b)</span><p><span class="cl">Question:</span> But our Mishnah allows scattered wood in a Karfaf!?</p></div>
<div class="indent1"><span class="nm">(c)</span><p><span class="cl">Answer:</span> Our Mishnah is the lone opinion of R. Elazar b'Rebbi Shimon (as he understands the Machlokes Beis Hillel and Beis Shamai) and not that of the Rabanan.</p></div>
<div class="subject"><span class="nm">3)</span><p>LIGHT FOLIAGE</p></div>
<div class="indent1"><span class="nm">(a)</span><p><span class="cl">(Rava):</span> One may not bring in (even pre-gathered) light foliage on Yom Tov because the owner knows that it will eventually get blown away and he does not rely on it (the owner may place a weight on the foliage before Shabbos to permit it).</p></div>
<div class="subject"><span class="nm">4)</span><p>THE MACHLOKES R. YEHUDAH AND R. YOSI OVER KARFAF</p></div>
<div class="indent1"><span class="nm">(a)</span><p><span class="cl">Question:</span> How are we to understand their positions?</p></div>
<div class="indent2"><span class="nm">1.</span><p>Does R. Yehudah require that the enclosure be both proximate to the city and have a lock (to which R. Yosi rep ies that either a lock or proximity suffices); or,</p></div>
<div class="indent2"><span class="nm">2.</span><p>Does R. Yehudah require proximity (whether it has a lock or not) while R. Yosi holds that it hinges on whether it has a lock or not?</p></div>
<div class="indent1"><span class="nm">(b)</span><p><span class="cl">Answer:</span> The Mishnah implies that R. Yosi adopts the two lenient positions (option 1 above, that either a lock or proximity is sufficient).</p></div>
<div class="indent1"><span class="nm">(c)</span><p><span class="cl">(R. Sela citing R. Yirmeyah):</span> The Halachah follows the lenient position of R. Yosi.</p></div>
<div class="subject"><span class="nm">5)</span><p>MISHNAH: CHOPPING WOOD</p></div>
<div class="indent1"><span class="nm">(a)</span><p>One may not chop up a house-beam which broke on Yom Tov.</p></div>
<div class="indent1"><span class="nm">(b)</span><p>One may not chop wood using a chopper, a saw or a scythe on Yom Tov but only with a chopping-knife.</p></div>
<div class="bbbline">31b----------------------------------------31b</p></div>
<div class="subject"><span class="nm">6)</span><p>THE REISHA SPEAKS ABOUT MUKTZAH</p></div>
<div class="indent1"><span class="nm">(a)</span><p><span class="cl">Question:</span> The Reisha seems to prohibit chopping wood (as in the case of the beam), yet the Seifa permits it with a chopping knife!?</p></div>
<div class="indent1"><span class="nm">(b)</span><p><span class="cl">Answer (R. Yehudah citing Shmuel):</span> The Mishnah must be emended to teach, in the Reisha, a Halachah of Muktzah (the beam) and then the Halachos of chopping.</p></div>
<div class="indent1"><span class="nm">(c)</span><p>This understanding of our Mishnah is supported by the cited Beraisa.</p></div>
<div class="subject"><span class="nm">7)</span><p>THE PROHIBITION OF USING AN AX</p></div>
<div class="indent1"><span class="nm">(a)</span><p><span class="cl">(R. Chinena b. Shalmaya citing Rav):</span> This prohibition ax applies to the wide end not to the stout end of an ax.</p></div>
<div class="indent1"><span class="nm">(b)</span><p><span class="cl">Question:</span> This is obvious, given that we only permit the chopping knife because it is not the skilled manner of chopping wood!?</p></div>
<div class="indent1"><span class="nm">(c)</span><p><span class="cl">Answer:</span> We might have prohibited the male end of the ax lest it be exchanged with the sharp end.</p></div>
<div class="indent1"><span class="nm">(d)</span><p><span class="cl">(Alternate application of Rav's teaching):</span> The permission to use a Kupitz is only on its male end, not on its female (wider) end.</p></div>
<div class="indent1"><span class="nm">(e)</span><p><span class="cl">Question:</span> Is this not obvious, since that is the prohibition of Kardum!?</p></div>
<div class="indent1"><span class="nm">(f)</span><p><span class="cl">Answer:</span> We might have only prohibited a Kardum (a skilled tool) but not a mixed skilled/non-skilled tool, where we might permit one end given that the other is permitted.</p></div>
<div class="subject"><span class="nm">8)</span><p>MISHNAH: APPLYING MUKTZAH TO A PREVIOUSLY SEALED ENCLOSURE</p></div>
<div class="indent1"><span class="nm">(a)</span><p><span class="cl">(Tana Kama):</span> One may take fruit from a sealed enclosure which broke open on Yom Tov.</p></div>
<div class="indent1"><span class="nm">(b)</span><p><span class="cl">(R. Meir):</span> One may even break open the enclosure to take fruit thereby.</p></div>
<div class="subject"><span class="nm">9)</span><p>R. MEIR'S HETER</p></div>
<div class="indent1"><span class="nm">(a)</span><p><span class="cl">Question:</span> How could it be permitted to break open the enclosure, given the Isur of Setiras Ohel!?</p></div>
<div class="indent1"><span class="nm">(b)</span><p><span class="cl">Answer (R. Nechumi b. Ada citing Shmuel):</span> The walls were simply rows of bricks without mortar.</p></div>
<div class="indent1"><span class="nm">(c)</span><p><span class="cl">Question:</span> But they should still be Muktzah (as R. Nachman taught that leftover bricks are Muktzah if arranged)!?</p></div>
<div class="indent1"><span class="nm">(d)</span><p><span class="cl">Answer (R. Zeira):</span> It is a Heter on Yom Tov (Ochel Nefesh but would not apply on Shabbos).</p></div>
<div class="indent1"><span class="nm">(e)</span><p>A Beraisa supports this understanding of the Mishnah.</p></div>
<div class="subject"><span class="nm">10)</span><p>ROPED CLOSURES</p></div>
<div class="indent1"><span class="nm">(a)</span><p><span class="cl">(Shmuel):</span> One may untie the ropes that tie the door of pits and caves, but not unravel nor cut the rope.</p></div>
<div class="indent1"><span class="nm">(b)</span><p>Ropes which tie the doors of Kelim may be untied, unraveled and cut, both on Shabbos and on Yom Tov.</p></div>
<div class="indent1"><span class="nm">(c)</span><p><span class="cl">Question:</span> But the Beraisa differentiates (regarding doors in the Karka) between Shabbos (when they may be untied but not unraveled or cut) and Yom Tov (when they may be untied, unraveled and cut)!?</p></div>
<div class="indent1"><span class="nm">(d)</span><p><span class="cl">Answer:</span> That Beraisa is the view of R. Meir who is lenient in our Mishnah.</p></div>
<div class="indent1"><span class="nm">(e)</span><p><span class="cl">Question:</span> But the Beraisa teaches that Chachamim <i>agree</i> with R. Meir and differentiate between Shabbos and Yom Tov!?</p></div>
<div class="indent1"><span class="nm">(f)</span><p><span class="cl">Answer:</span> Shmuel holds like another Beraisa which forbids unraveling and cutting the ropes on both Shabbos and Yom Tov.</p></div>
