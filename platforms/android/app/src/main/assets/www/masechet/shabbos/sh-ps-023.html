<p class="bas indent1"><span class="nm">(a)</span><span class="cl">Answer #3:</span> R. Yehoshua ben Levi taught that if a big lantern [was lit for Ner Chanukah on Erev Shabbos] burned the entire day, one may extinguish it on Motzei Shabbos and relight it (for the Mitzvah on Motzei Shabbos).</p>
<p class="bas indent2"><span class="nm">1.</span>If the Mitzvah is Hadlakah, we understand why it suffices to extinguish it and relight it;</p>
<p class="bas indent2"><span class="nm">2.</span>But if the Mitzvah is Hanachah, he should also have to pick it up and put it down! (Tosfos - he also must relight it, since it was not lit at the time of the Mitzvah. This answer is accepted; the Gemara further supports it.)</p>
<p class="bas indent1"><span class="nm">(b)</span><span class="cl">Answer #4:</span> We bless '...Asher Kidshanu...<i>Lehadlik</i>...' - this shows that the Mitzvah is Hadlakah.</p>
<p class="bas indent1"><span class="nm">(c)</span><span class="cl">Corollary:</span> Since the Mitzvah is Hadlakah, if a child, lunatic or deaf person lit, the Ner may not be used for the Mitzvah [unless someone obligated to keep Mitzvos will extinguish it and relight it].</p>
<p class="bas indent1"><span class="nm">(d)</span>Surely, a woman may light;</p>
<p class="bas indent2"><span class="nm">1.</span><span class="cl">(R. Yehoshua ben Levi):</span> Ner Chanukah is obligatory upon women, because they were party to the Nes (they were saved from Yevani decrees; also, a woman had a share in the Nes of the war).</p>
<p class="bas indent1"><span class="nm">(e)</span><span class="cl">(Rav Sheshes):</span> Ner Chanukah is obligatory upon someone lodging outside his house.</p>
<p class="bas indent1"><span class="nm">(f)</span><span class="cl">(R. Zeira):</span> When I was single and learning by my Rebbi, I would contribute a Perutah towards the cost of the Neros [of my host];</p>
<p class="bas indent2"><span class="nm">1.</span>After I married, I need not - my wife lights on my behalf in my house.</p>
<p class="bas indent1"><span class="nm">(g)</span><span class="cl">(R. Yehoshua ben Levi):</span> All oils are good for Ner Chanukah (he holds like Rav (21B) - olive oil is the best.</p>
<p class="bas indent1"><span class="nm">(h)</span><span class="cl">(Abaye):</span> At first, Rabah would seek to use sesame oil, for it burns longest - after he heard R. Yehoshua ben Levi's teaching, he would seek olive oil, for its light is clearest.</p>
<p class="bas indent1"><span class="nm">(i)</span><span class="cl">(R. Yehoshua ben Levi):</span> All oils are good for ink - olive oil is the best.</p>
<p class="bas indent1"><span class="nm">(j)</span><span class="cl">Question:</span> (In making ink, one smokes glass in steam of oil (blackening it), then scrapes off the black and kneads it with a bit of oil; when it dries, it is smeared into the ink.) Is olive oil best for smoking, or for kneading?</p>
<p class="bas indent1"><span class="nm">(k)</span><span class="cl">Version #1 - Answer (Rav Shmuel bar Zutri - Beraisa):</span> All oils are good for ink - olive oil is best, both for smoking and for kneading.</p>
<p class="bas indent1"><span class="nm">(l)</span><span class="cl">Version #2 (Rav Shmuel bar Zutr<i>a</i> - Beraisa):</span> All smokes are good for ink - the best is of olive oil.</p>
<p class="bas indent1"><span class="nm">(m)</span><span class="cl">(Rav Huna):</span> All saps are good for ink - the best is sap of Ketaf (balsam).</p>
<p class="bas subject"><span class="nm">2)</span>THE BERACHOS MADE ON NEROS CHANUKAH</p>
<p class="bas indent1"><span class="nm">(a)</span><span class="cl">(R. Chiya bar Aba):</span> One who lights Ner Chanukah must bless.</p>
<p class="bas indent1"><span class="nm">(b)</span><span class="cl">(R. Yirmeyah):</span> One who sees Ner Chanukah (Rashi - before he lit; Ran - and he himself will not light tonight) must bless.</p>
<p class="bas indent1"><span class="nm">(c)</span><span class="cl">(Rav Yehudah):</span> The first night, one who sees Ner Chanukah makes two Berachos (he omits 'Lehadlik'), one who lights makes three Berachos; on other nights, one who sees makes one Berachah, one who lights makes two Berachos.</p>
<p class="bas indent1"><span class="nm">(d)</span><span class="cl">Question:</span> Which Berachah is omitted on other nights?</p>
<p class="bas indent1"><span class="nm">(e)</span><span class="cl">Answer:</span> Shehecheyanu is omitted.</p>
<p class="bas indent1"><span class="nm">(f)</span><span class="cl">Question:</span> He should omit Nes (she'Asa Nisim la'Avoseinu)!</p>
<p class="bas indent1"><span class="nm">(g)</span><span class="cl">Answer:</span> The Nes applied every day (so we bless for it every day).</p>
<p class="bas indent1"><span class="nm">(h)</span><span class="cl">Question:</span> What is the text of [the other] Berachah?</p>
<p class="bas indent1"><span class="nm">(i)</span><span class="cl">Answer:</span> It is '...Asher Kidshanu b'Mitzvosav v'Tzivanu Lehadlik Ner Shel Chanukah'.</p>
<p class="bas indent1"><span class="nm">(j)</span><span class="cl">Question:</span> Where did Hash-m command us about Ner Chanukah?</p>
<p class="bas indent1"><span class="nm">(k)</span><span class="cl">Answer #1 (Rav Avya):</span> He commanded "Lo Sasur" (do not deviate from what Chachamim say).</p>
<p class="bas indent1"><span class="nm">(l)</span><span class="cl">Answer #2 (Rav Nechemyah):</span> It says "She'al Avicha v'Yagedcha Zekenecha va'Yomru Lach".</p>
<p class="bas indent1"><span class="nm">(m)</span><span class="cl">Question (Rav Amram - Mishnah):</span> One may use Demai (doubtfully tithed produce) for an Eiruv or Shituf (an Eiruv of an alleyway); we bless on it make a Zimun on it; one may tithe it when naked or Bein ha'Shemashos.</p>
<p class="bas indent2"><span class="nm">1.</span>If we must bless on all Mitzvos mid'Rabanan, why may one tithe it when naked - "V'Hayah Machanecha Kadosh" (one may not say Divrei Kedushah where Ervah is visible)!</p>
<p class="bas indent1"><span class="nm">(n)</span><span class="cl">Answer #1 (Abaye):</span> We bless on all Vadai Mitzvos mid'Rabanan, but not on tithing Demai, for it is a Safek (perhaps it was already tithed).</p>
<p class="bas indent1"><span class="nm">(o)</span><span class="cl">Question:</span> In Chutz la'Aretz, people observe a second day of Yom Tov on account of Safek, yet they bless on it (e.g. Kidush)!</p>
<p class="bas indent1"><span class="nm">(p)</span><span class="cl">Answer:</span> [Letter of the law they should not bless -] Chachamim were concerned that if they will not bless, they will be treat it lightly.</p>
<p class="bas indent1"><span class="nm">(q)</span><span class="cl">Answer #2 (Rava):</span> [We bless even on Safek Mitzvos mid'Rabanan -] Demai is not even considered a Safek, for most Amei ha'Aretz tithe (it is a mere stringency mid'Rabanan to tithe it).</p>
<p class="bas subject"><span class="nm">3)</span>CONCERN FOR THAT ONE MIGHT AROUSE SUSPICION</p>
<p class="bas indent1"><span class="nm">(a)</span><span class="cl">(Rav Huna):</span> If a house has two openings to a Chatzer, Ner Chanukah must be placed in both.</p>
<p class="bas indent1"><span class="nm">(b)</span><span class="cl">(Rava):</span> This is only if the openings are on different sides of the house, not if they are on the same side.</p>
<p class="bas indent1"><span class="nm">(c)</span><span class="cl">Question:</span> What is the reason?</p>
<p class="bas indent2"><span class="nm">1.</span><span class="cl">Suggestion:</span> Two Neros are required on account of suspicion (people will think that the Ba'al ha'Bayis did not light):</p>
<p class="bas indent2"><span class="nm">2.</span><span class="cl">Question:</span> Whose suspicion are we concerned for?</p>
<p class="bas indent3"><span class="nm">i.</span>If we are concerned for people from other cities, even if both openings are on the same side they will suspect (that the house is split, and the resident of one side did not light)!</p>
<p class="bas indent3"><span class="nm">ii.</span>If we are concerned for people of this city (they know that the house is not split), even if both openings are on opposite sides they will not suspect (they will see that the Ba'al ha'Bayis lit on the other side)!</p>
<p class="bas indent1"><span class="nm">(d)</span><span class="cl">Answer (to both questions):</span> We are concerned for people of this city - perhaps some will pass by only on this side, they will suspect, just like the Ba'al ha'Bayis did not light on this side, he did not light on the other side!</p>
<p class="bas indent1"><span class="nm">(e)</span><span class="cl">Question:</span> What is the source that we are concerned for suspicion?</p>
<p class="bas indent1"><span class="nm">(f)</span><span class="cl">Answer (Beraisa - R. Shimon):</span> There are four reasons why the Torah commands to leave Pe'ah at the end of the harvest (they will be explained) - to protect the poor from theft, to spare them time, on account of suspicion, and on account of "Lo Sechaleh";</p>
<p class="bas indent2"><span class="nm">1.</span>To protect the poor from theft - lest the Ba'al ha'Bayis will find an opportune time to tell one of his poor relatives 'This is the Pe'ah [go take it]!"</p>
<p class="bas bbbline">23b----------------------------------------23b</p>
<p class="bas indent2"><span class="nm">2.</span>To spare Aniyim time - so they will not wait around, anticipating that the Ba'al ha'Bayis is about to declare the Pe'ah;</p>
<p class="bas indent2"><span class="nm">3.</span>On account of suspicion - so passersby will not [see the entire perimeter harvested and] curse the Ba'al ha'Bayis for not leaving Pe'ah;</p>
<p class="bas indent2"><span class="nm">4.</span>On account of "Lo Sechaleh" (this connotes the end).</p>
<p class="bas indent1"><span class="nm">(g)</span><span class="cl">Question:</span> The first three reasons explain why the Torah commands to leave at the end!</p>
<p class="bas indent1"><span class="nm">(h)</span><span class="cl">Answer (Rava):</span> It means, on account of swindlers [who would claim that they already left Pe'ah and Aniyim took it].</p>
<p class="bas indent1"><span class="nm">(i)</span><span class="cl">(R. Yitzchak bar Redifah):</span> If a Ner has two openings (for wicks), two people can fulfill the Mitzvah through it.</p>
<p class="bas indent1"><span class="nm">(j)</span><span class="cl">(Rava):</span> If one filled a bowl with oil, surrounded it with wicks and covered it with a Kli, many people may be Yotzei with it;</p>
<p class="bas indent2"><span class="nm">1.</span>If it is not covered, [the flames merge,] it is like a bonfire, no one may be Yotzei (it does not resemble a Ner).</p>
<p class="bas subject"><span class="nm">4)</span>HOW TO MERIT CHILDREN THAT ARE <i>CHACHAMIM</i></p>
<p class="bas indent1"><span class="nm">(a)</span><span class="cl">(Rava):</span> The following is obvious to me - if one does not have enough money for Ner Shabbos and Ner Chanukah, Ner Shabbos has precedence, so there will be Shalom Bayis (people are pained to dwell in darkness).</p>
<p class="bas indent1"><span class="nm">(b)</span>If he does not have enough money for Ner Shabbos and [wine for] Kidush ha'Yom [at the start of Shabbos, it is mid'Oraisa], Ner Shabbos has precedence, on account of Shalom Bayis;</p>
<p class="bas indent1"><span class="nm">(c)</span><span class="cl">Question (Rava):</span> If he does not have enough money for Ner Chanukah and Kidush ha'Yom, which has precedence?</p>
<p class="bas indent2"><span class="nm">1.</span>Kidush ha'Yom has precedence, for it is Tadir (comes more frequently);</p>
<p class="bas indent2"><span class="nm">2.</span>Or, perhaps Ner Chanukah has precedence, to publicize the Nes!</p>
<p class="bas indent1"><span class="nm">(d)</span><span class="cl">Conclusion (Rava):</span> Ner Chanukah has precedence, to publicize the Nes.</p>
<p class="bas indent1"><span class="nm">(e)</span><span class="cl">(Rav Huna):</span> One who regularly fulfills Ner Shabbos and Ner Chanukah will have children who are Chachamim ("Ki Ner Mitzvah v'Sorah Or";)</p>
<p class="bas indent1"><span class="nm">(f)</span>One who is careful to fulfill Mezuzah properly will merit to have a nice dwelling; one who is careful about Tzitzis will merit to have a nice garment;</p>
<p class="bas indent1"><span class="nm">(g)</span>One who is careful about Kidush ha'Yom will merit to have much wine;</p>
<p class="bas indent1"><span class="nm">(h)</span>Rav Huna used to pass by the door of R. Avin Nagra; he saw that he used to burn much oil. Rav Huna said that great Chachamim will descend from him; this was fulfilled through Rav Idi bar Avin and Rav Chiya bar Avin.</p>
<p class="bas indent1"><span class="nm">(i)</span>Rav Chisda saw that the father (or father-in-law) of Rav Shizbi used to burn much oil; he said that a great Chacham will descend from him - this was fulfilled through Rav Shizbi.</p>
<p class="bas indent1"><span class="nm">(j)</span>Rav Yosef's wife used to light Ner Shabbos late [close to dark].</p>
<p class="bas indent1"><span class="nm">(k)</span><span class="cl">Rav Yosef:</span> A Beraisa teaches "Lo Yamish Amud he'Anan Yomam v'Amud ha'Esh Laylah Lifnei ha'Am" - the fire came before the cloud left (towards evening - this teaches that it is proper to light before dark); the fire would not leave until the cloud came (in the morning).</p>
<p class="bas indent1"><span class="nm">(l)</span><span class="cl">His wife:</span> If so, I will light early in the day!</p>
<p class="bas indent1"><span class="nm">(m)</span><span class="cl">(An elder - Beraisa):</span> One may not light too early [for then it is not evident that the light is for the sake of Shabbos] nor too late.</p>
<p class="bas indent1"><span class="nm">(n)</span><span class="cl">(Rava):</span> One who loves Chachamim will have children who are Chachamim; one who honors Chachamim will have son-in-laws who are Chachamim;</p>
<p class="bas indent1"><span class="nm">(o)</span>One who fears Chachamim will himself become a Chacham;</p>
<p class="bas indent2"><span class="nm">1.</span>If this is not feasible [for he does not learn regularly], his words will be heeded like those of a Chacham.</p>

<p class="bas indent1"><span class="nm">(b)</span><span class="cl">Question:</span> What is Shemen Sereifah?</p>
<p class="bas indent1"><span class="nm">(c)</span><span class="cl">Answer (Rabah):</span> It is Tamei Terumah oil - it is called Shemen Sereifah because it must be burned.</p>
<p class="bas indent1"><span class="nm">(d)</span><span class="cl">Question:</span> Why is it forbidden to use for Shabbos?</p>
<p class="bas indent1"><span class="nm">(e)</span><span class="cl">Answer #1:</span> Because it is a Mitzvah to burn it [lest someone will come to eat it], we decree lest he will tilt the Ner [to ensure that all of it burns].</p>
<p class="bas indent2"><span class="nm">1.</span><span class="cl">Question (Abaye - Mishnah):</span> One may not light Shemen Sereifah on Yom Tov.</p>

<p class="bas indent2"><span class="nm">2.</span><span class="cl">Answer (Rabah):</span> This is a decree, lest one will burn it on Shabbos.</p>
<p class="bas indent1"><span class="nm">(f)</span><span class="cl">Answer #2 (Rav Chisda):</span> [One may use Shemen Sereifah on a regular Shabbos,] we are not concerned lest he tilt the Ner;</p>
<p class="bas indent2"><span class="nm">1.</span>The Mishnah forbids it only when Erev Shabbos is Yom Tov, for we may not burn Kodshim on Yom Tov.</p>
<p class="bas indent1"><span class="nm">(g)</span><span class="cl">Question:</span> The Seifa (the next Mishnah) forbids lighting Shemen Sereifah on Yom Tov - this implies that the Reisha does not discuss Yom Tov!</p>
<p class="bas indent1"><span class="nm">(h)</span><span class="cl">Answer (R. Chanina of Sura):</span> The Seifa gives the reason for the Reisha - we may not burn Shemen Sereifah on Erev Shabbos that is Yom Tov, for we may not burn [Pasul] Kodshim on Yom Tov.</p>
<p class="bas indent1"><span class="nm">(i)</span><span class="cl">Support (for Rav Chisda - Beraisa):</span> All the oils forbidden for Shabbos are permitted on Yom Tov, except for Shemen Sereifah, for we may not burn Kodshim on Yom Tov.</p>
