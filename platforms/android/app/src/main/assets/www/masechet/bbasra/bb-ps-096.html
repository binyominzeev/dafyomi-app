<p class="bas subject"><span class="nm">1)</span>WHEN WE ARE CONCERNED FOR SPOILAGE</p>
<p class="bas indent1"><span class="nm">(a)</span><span class="cl">Abaye (to Rav Yosef):</span> What is your opinion?</p>
<p class="bas indent1"><span class="nm">(b)</span><span class="cl">(Rav Yosef - Beraisa):</span> Reuven left a barrel of wine, and when he tithes his wine, he declares that the tithes should take effect on (the proper amount of) wine in the barrel. Once, he checked the barrel and found that it had become vinegar (tithes taken from vinegar to exempt wine are invalid). The first three days are definite (this will be explained). Past this is doubtful.</p>
<p class="bas indent2"><span class="nm">1.</span><span class="cl">Question:</span> What does this mean?</p>
<p class="bas indent2"><span class="nm">2.</span><span class="cl">Answer #1 (R. Yochanan):</span> The first three days (after it was last checked, and tasted and smelled like wine), it was surely wine. After this, we are in doubt.</p>
<p class="bas indent3"><span class="nm">i.</span><span class="cl">Question:</span> What is the reason?</p>
<p class="bas indent3"><span class="nm">ii.</span><span class="cl">Answer:</span> Wine spoils from the top. Even if it started souring immediately after the last tasting, the smell would be like vinegar but the taste would be like wine for three days. This is still considered wine.</p>
<p class="bas indent2"><span class="nm">3.</span><span class="cl">Version #1 - Answer #2 (R. Yehoshua ben Levi):</span> The last three days (before it was found to be vinegar) it was surely vinegar. Before this, we are in doubt.</p>
<p class="bas indent3"><span class="nm">i.</span><span class="cl">Question:</span> What is the reason?</p>
<p class="bas indent3"><span class="nm">ii.</span><span class="cl">Answer:</span> (If it now tastes like vinegar, it started to smell like vinegar at least three days ago. R. Yehoshua ben Levi considers this to be vinegar. If) wine spoils from the bottom, perhaps it already spoiled when he last tasted it;</p>
<p class="bas indent3"><span class="nm">iii.</span>Even if we say that it spoils from the top, perhaps it immediately started to smell like vinegar after the last tasting, and this is considered vinegar.</p>
<p class="bas indent2"><span class="nm">4.</span><span class="cl">Version #2 - Answer #2 (R. Yehoshua ben Levi):</span> The first three days (after the previous checking, when it tasted and smelled like wine), it was surely wine. The last three days (before it was found to be vinegar) it was surely vinegar. We are in doubt about the intermediate days.</p>
<p class="bas indent2"><span class="nm">5.</span><span class="cl">Question:</span> If the first three days it was surely wine, he must say that if it smells like vinegar but tastes like wine, it is wine;</p>
<p class="bas indent3"><span class="nm">i.</span>However, he says that the last three days it was surely vinegar. This implies that if it smells like vinegar but tastes like wine, it is vinegar!</p>
<p class="bas indent2"><span class="nm">6.</span><span class="cl">Answer:</span> (Really, he holds that if it smells like vinegar but tastes like wine, it is wine.) The case is, it was found to be very strong vinegar, so it must have tasted like vinegar for at least three days.</p>
<p class="bas indent1"><span class="nm">(c)</span><span class="cl">Question:</span> Like whom does Rav Yosef hold?</p>
<p class="bas indent1"><span class="nm">(d)</span><span class="cl">(Rav Mari or Rav Zvid):</span> He holds like R. Yochanan.</p>
<p class="bas indent1"><span class="nm">(e)</span><span class="cl">(The other of Rav Mari and Rav Zvid):</span> He holds like R. Yehoshua ben Levi.</p>
<p class="bas indent1"><span class="nm">(f)</span><span class="cl">(Rav):</span> If Reuven sold a barrel of wine to Shimon, and it became vinegar, if this was within three days of the sale, it already started spoiling before the sale, so the sale is invalid;</p>
<p class="bas indent2"><span class="nm">1.</span>If this was more than three days after the sale, it started spoiling after the sale, so the sale is valid.</p>
<p class="bas bbbline">96b----------------------------------------96b</p>
<p class="bas indent1"><span class="nm">(g)</span><span class="cl">(Shmuel):</span> Even if it spoiled within three days, this is due to Shimon's Mazel (fortune), so the sale is valid.</p>
<p class="bas indent1"><span class="nm">(h)</span>Rav Yosef ruled like Rav in a case involving beer, and like Shmuel in a case involving wine.</p>
<p class="bas indent1"><span class="nm">(i)</span>The Halachah follows Shmuel.</p>
<p class="bas subject"><span class="nm">2)</span>TEMED (WINE FROM DREGS)</p>
<p class="bas indent1"><span class="nm">(a)</span><span class="cl">(Beraisa):</span> One blesses sheha'Kol on beer of dates or barley, and on dregs of wine;</p>
<p class="bas indent1"><span class="nm">(b)</span>Others say, if the dregs have the taste of wine, he blesses Borei Peri ha'Gafen.</p>
<p class="bas indent1"><span class="nm">(c)</span><span class="cl">(Rabah and Rav Yosef):</span> The Halachah does not follow 'Others'.</p>
<p class="bas indent1"><span class="nm">(d)</span><span class="cl">(Rava):</span> All agree that if one puts three measures of water on the dregs and four measures of liquid come out (at least one measure came from the dregs), it is considered wine;</p>
<p class="bas indent2"><span class="nm">1.</span>This is like Rava taught elsewhere, that if one measure of (raw) wine cannot be mixed with three measures of water (lest the mixture be too weak), the (raw) wine is substandard.</p>
<p class="bas indent1"><span class="nm">(e)</span><span class="cl">(Rava):</span> All agree that if one puts in three measures and three come out, it is considered water;</p>
<p class="bas indent2"><span class="nm">1.</span>They argue in a case that he puts three, and three and a half come out. Chachamim say that the same three measures of water came out, and a half-measure from the dregs;</p>
<p class="bas indent3"><span class="nm">i.</span>There is six times as much water as dreg-wine, so this is not considered wine.</p>
<p class="bas indent2"><span class="nm">2.</span>Others say that two and a half measures of water came out, and one measure from the dregs;</p>
<p class="bas indent3"><span class="nm">i.</span>There is two and a half times as much water as dreg-wine, so this is considered wine.</p>
