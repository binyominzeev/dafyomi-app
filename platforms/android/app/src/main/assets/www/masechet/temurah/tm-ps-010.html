<p class="bas subject"><span class="nm">1)</span>A <i>KORBAN</i> THAT WAS <i>HUKDASH</i> ON BEHALF OF SOMEONE ELSE</p>
<p class="bas indent1"><span class="nm">(a)</span><span class="cl">Question (Rami bar Chama):</span> If Reuven was Makdish an animal for Shimon to bring, which of them adds a Chomesh (if he redeems it)?</p>
<p class="bas indent1"><span class="nm">(b)</span><span class="cl">Answer (Rava):</span> "V'Im ha'Makdish Yig'al Es Beiso (v'Yosaf Chamishis)" teaches that the Makdish (Reuven) adds a Chomesh, not the Miskaper (Shimon, for whom the Korban atones).</p>
<p class="bas indent1"><span class="nm">(c)</span><span class="cl">Question (Rami bar Chama):</span> Can the Makdish make Temurah, or the Miskaper?</p>
<p class="bas indent1"><span class="nm">(d)</span><span class="cl">Answer (Rava):</span> It must be the Miskaper. If it were the Makdish, Temurah could apply to a Korban of the Tzibur or partners, e.g., if they made a Shali'ach to be Makdish the animal! (The Hekesh to Ma'aser teaches that Temurah applies only to a Korban of an individual.)</p>
<p class="bas indent1"><span class="nm">(e)</span><span class="cl">Support (Rava):</span> We learn this also from Rav Nachman:</p>
<p class="bas indent2"><span class="nm">1.</span><span class="cl">Question (Rav Nachman):</span> Why does it say "Korbano la'Shem Al Nizro Milvad Asher Tasig Yado"? Heseg Yad does not apply to Nezirus! (Rich and poor bring the same Korbanos.)</p>
<p class="bas indent2"><span class="nm">2.</span><span class="cl">Answer:</span> "Korbano la'Shem Al Nizro" refers to Korbanos that he (the Nazir) himself was Makdish. "Milvad Asher Tasig Yado" refers to Korbanos that others were Makdish for him.</p>
<p class="bas indent2"><span class="nm">3.</span><span class="cl">Question:</span> What does the verse teach?</p>
<p class="bas indent3"><span class="nm">i.</span>It need not teach that he can be Yotzei with others' Korbanos. This is obvious! (They are mere gifts.)</p>
<p class="bas indent2"><span class="nm">4.</span><span class="cl">Answer:</span> It teaches that he can make Temurah on them.</p>
<p class="bas indent2"><span class="nm">5.</span><span class="cl">Summation of answer:</span> This shows that the Miskaper can make Temurah.</p>
<p class="bas indent1"><span class="nm">(f)</span><span class="cl">Rejection:</span> Really, it teaches that he can be Yotzei with others' Korbanos;</p>
<p class="bas indent2"><span class="nm">1.</span>One might have thought that a Gezeiras ha'Kasuv requires him to bring his own Korbanos. The verse teaches that this is not so.</p>
<p class="bas indent1"><span class="nm">(g)</span><span class="cl">Question:</span> What was the conclusion? (Shitah - also Answer #1 is not conclusive. Even if normally the Makdish can make Temurah, we would know that this does not apply to Korbanos Tzibur.)</p>
<p class="bas indent1"><span class="nm">(h)</span><span class="cl">Answer:</span> R. Avahu taught that the Makdish adds a Chomesh, and the Miskaper can make Temurah;</p>
<p class="bas indent1"><span class="nm">(i)</span>He also taught that if Reuven makes his produce Terumah to exempt Shimon's, Reuven has Tovas Hana'ah (the right to give it to any Kohen he wants).</p>
<p class="bas indent1"><span class="nm">(j)</span><span class="cl">Question:</span> What is the reason?</p>
<p class="bas indent1"><span class="nm">(k)</span><span class="cl">Answer:</span> "Es Kol Ma'asar Tevu'ascha... v'Nasatah" (the one whose produce it is gives it, to whom he wants).</p>
<p class="bas subject"><span class="nm">2)</span>CAN ONE BE <i>MAKDISH</i> A FETUS?</p>
<p class="bas indent1"><span class="nm">(a)</span><span class="cl">(Mishnah):</span> Temurah does not take effect in the following cases:</p>
<p class="bas indent2"><span class="nm">1.</span>Limbs on fetuses, fetuses on limbs, limbs or fetuses on whole animals or vice-versa;</p>
<p class="bas indent1"><span class="nm">(b)</span>R. Yosi says, fetuses on whole animals takes effect, but not vice-versa.</p>
<p class="bas indent2"><span class="nm">1.</span><span class="cl">R. Yosi:</span> If one says "the leg of this (Chulin) animal is an Olah", the entire animal becomes an Olah - also here, if he says "the leg of this (Chulin) animalo is Tachas this (Korban)," the entire Chulin animal becomes Temurah!</p>
<p class="bas indent1"><span class="nm">(c)</span><span class="cl">(Gemara - Bar Pada):</span> Kedushah does not take effect on fetuses;</p>
<p class="bas indent1"><span class="nm">(d)</span><span class="cl">(R. Yochanan):</span> It takes effect on fetuses.</p>
<p class="bas indent1"><span class="nm">(e)</span>This is like R. Yochanan taught elsewhere:</p>
<p class="bas indent2"><span class="nm">1.</span><span class="cl">(R. Yochanan):</span> If one was Makdish a pregnant animal for a Chatas and it gave birth, he may bring either of them for his Chatas. (It is as if he was Makdish two animals for Acharayus, i.e. if one of them will become blemished or lost, the other will be offered).</p>
<p class="bas indent1"><span class="nm">(f)</span><span class="cl">Version #1:</span> He needed to teach both laws:</p>
<p class="bas indent2"><span class="nm">1.</span>Had he taught only the first law, one might have thought that this is only when he is Makdish the fetus by itself, but when he is Makdish the mother, the fetus is Kodesh only like part of the mother (and he cannot get Kaparah through it);</p>
<p class="bas bbbline">10b----------------------------------------10b</p>
<p class="bas indent2"><span class="nm">2.</span>Had he taught only the second law, one might have thought that this is only when he is Makdish the whole animal, but when he is Makdish only the fetus, since it is not here (outside), it is not Kodesh.</p>
<p class="bas indent1"><span class="nm">(g)</span><span class="cl">Version #2 - Question:</span> What is the Chidush (of R. Yochanan's second teaching)?</p>
<p class="bas indent1"><span class="nm">(h)</span><span class="cl">Answer:</span> It teaches that one can (be Makdish a pregnant mother and) be Meshayer (stipulate that the fetus be Chulin or a different Korban), and that Ubar Lav Yerech Imo. (A fetus is considered an independent animal. It is not just a part of the mother.)</p>
<p class="bas indent1"><span class="nm">(i)</span><span class="cl">Question:</span> Why do we need both teachings?</p>
<p class="bas indent1"><span class="nm">(j)</span><span class="cl">Answer:</span> Both of them are needed:</p>
<p class="bas indent2"><span class="nm">1.</span>Had he taught only the second law, one might have thought that when the mother gets Kedushas ha'Guf (to be offered), the fetus is Hukdash with it, but when he is Makdish the fetus by itself, it is not Kodesh;</p>
<p class="bas indent2"><span class="nm">2.</span>Had he taught only the first law, one might have thought that this is only when he specifies that the fetus be Kodesh, but when he is Makdish the mother, the fetus is Kodesh only like part of the mother. (end of Version #2)</p>
<p class="bas indent1"><span class="nm">(k)</span><span class="cl">Question (against Bar Pada - R. Yirmeyah - Mishnah):</span> A ruse to uproot Kedushas Bechor is that one may say about a pregnant Mevakeres (animal that has not given birth before) "the fetus inside is an Olah." If it gives birth to a male, it is an Olah.</p>
<p class="bas indent2"><span class="nm">1.</span>This shows that Hekdesh of a fetus takes effect!</p>
<p class="bas indent1"><span class="nm">(l)</span><span class="cl">Answer (R. Zeira):</span> That is when he was Mekadesh the fetus Kedushas Damim to buy an Olah.</p>
<p class="bas indent1"><span class="nm">(m)</span><span class="cl">Question (R. Yirmeyah):</span> Is Kedushas Damim strong enough to inhibit Kedushas Bechor?</p>
<p class="bas indent1"><span class="nm">(n)</span><span class="cl">Answer (R. Zeira):</span> Yes!</p>
<p class="bas indent2"><span class="nm">1.</span><span class="cl">(Mishnah):</span> If one was Makdish an animal with a Mum Kavu'a for any Korban (except for Bechor or Ma'aser), and it was redeemed, (if it will have a firstborn male,) Kedushas Bechor applies to it, Matanos must be given (when it is slaughtered)...</p>
<p class="bas indent2"><span class="nm">2.</span><span class="cl">Inference:</span> Before it was redeemed, Kedushas Bechor does not apply, i.e. Kedushas Damim inhibits Kedushas Bechor.</p>
<p class="bas indent1"><span class="nm">(o)</span><span class="cl">Question (R. Yirmeyah - Beraisa):</span> If one said "the fetus inside this animal is an Olah"; the mother may be sheared. One may not work with it, for this weakens the fetus.</p>
<p class="bas indent1"><span class="nm">(p)</span><span class="cl">Answer (R. Zeira):</span> There also, he was Mekadesh the fetus with Kedushas Damim.</p>
<p class="bas indent1"><span class="nm">(q)</span><span class="cl">Question (R. Yirmeyah):</span> Is Kedushas Damim strong enough to forbid working with it?</p>
<p class="bas indent1"><span class="nm">(r)</span><span class="cl">Answer (R. Zeira):</span> Yes!</p>
<p class="bas indent2"><span class="nm">1.</span>(The above Mishnah):... It becomes Chulin regarding shearing it and working with it.</p>
<p class="bas indent2"><span class="nm">2.</span><span class="cl">Inference:</span> Before it was redeemed, these were forbidden!</p>
<p class="bas subject"><span class="nm">3)</span><i>HEKDESH</i> OF PART OF AN ANIMAL</p>
<p class="bas indent1"><span class="nm">(a)</span><span class="cl">Question (R. Yirmeyah - our Mishnah (7a)):</span> Temurah does not take effect in the following cases -- limbs on fetuses, fetuses on limbs...</p>
<p class="bas indent2"><span class="nm">1.</span><span class="cl">Inference:</span> We must say that fetuses can become Kodesh. If not, there would be no need to say that Temurah of whole animals on fetuses does not take effect, for the latter would be Chulin!</p>
<p class="bas indent1"><span class="nm">(b)</span><span class="cl">Answer (R. Zeira):</span> The Mishnah teaches about fetuses inside Kodshim. They are automatically Kodesh. (One need not be Makdish them separately.)</p>
<p class="bas indent1"><span class="nm">(c)</span><span class="cl">Question - Inference:</span> Temurah of animals on fetuses inside Kodshim does not take effect, but if Temurah was done after they are born, it would take effect (but this is not true)!</p>
<p class="bas indent2"><span class="nm">1.</span><span class="cl">(Mishnah):</span> Temurah does not take effect on Velados Kodshim.</p>
<p class="bas indent1"><span class="nm">(d)</span><span class="cl">Answer:</span> Our Mishnah is like R. Yehudah, who says that Temurah takes effect on Velados Kodshim.</p>
<p class="bas indent1"><span class="nm">(e)</span><span class="cl">Question:</span> If our Mishnah is R. Yehudah, can we say that Temurah of limbs on whole animals does not take effect, but (if one is Makdish a limb), it (the entire animal) becomes Kodesh?! (From R. Yosi's question, we infer that the Stam Tana of our Mishnah agrees that Hekdesh of a limb is Mekadesh the entire animal. They argue only about Temurah.)</p>
<p class="bas indent2"><span class="nm">1.</span><span class="cl">(Beraisa - R. Yehudah):</span> If one is Makdish a limb, the entire animal does not become Kodesh.</p>
<p class="bas indent1"><span class="nm">(f)</span><span class="cl">Answer:</span> The Mishnah refers to a limb vital to life. (R. Yehudah agrees that Hekdesh of such a limb is Mekadesh the entire animal.)</p>
