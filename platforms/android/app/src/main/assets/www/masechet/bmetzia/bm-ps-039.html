<p class="bas subject"><span class="nm">1)</span>THE LAW OF THE OVERSEER</p>
<p class="bas indent1"><span class="nm">(a)</span><span class="cl">(Beraisa):</span> Regarding all of them, the one working the property is paid like a sharecropper.</p>
<p class="bas indent1"><span class="nm">(b)</span><span class="cl">Question:</span> To which case does this refer?</p>
<p class="bas indent2"><span class="nm">1.</span>It cannot refer to property of a captive. The worker can harvest and keep it, surely he is paid for improvements!</p>
<p class="bas indent1"><span class="nm">(c)</span><span class="cl">Answer #1:</span> Rather, it refers to Retushim property.</p>
<p class="bas indent1"><span class="nm">(d)</span><span class="cl">Objection:</span> It says that we remove it from him! (It is as if he worked it without permission. Surely he does not receive like a sharecropper)!!</p>
<p class="bas indent1"><span class="nm">(e)</span><span class="cl">Answer #2:</span> Rather, it refers to Netushim property.</p>
<p class="bas indent1"><span class="nm">(f)</span><span class="cl">Question:</span> According to whom is he paid like a sharecropper?</p>
<p class="bas indent2"><span class="nm">1.</span>Chachamim say that we remove it from him!</p>
<p class="bas indent2"><span class="nm">2.</span>R. Shimon says that it is like property of a captive!</p>
<p class="bas indent1"><span class="nm">(g)</span><span class="cl">Answer:</span> R. Shimon means, in some ways it is like property of a captive, and in some ways, it is not.</p>
<p class="bas indent2"><span class="nm">1.</span>We do not remove it from him, It is like property of a captive;</p>
<p class="bas indent2"><span class="nm">2.</span>It is unlike property of a captive, for there, he can harvest and keep it. Here, he is paid like a sharecropper.</p>
<p class="bas indent1"><span class="nm">(h)</span><span class="cl">Question:</span> What is the difference between this and the following?</p>
<p class="bas indent2"><span class="nm">1.</span><span class="cl">(Mishnah):</span> If one spent money on his wife's Nichsei Melug, whether he spent a lot and consumed a little, or vice-versa, there is no compensation (when she gets it back after she is widowed or divorced).</p>
<p class="bas indent1"><span class="nm">(i)</span><span class="cl">Answer:</span> Property of a captive resembles the following.</p>
<p class="bas indent2"><span class="nm">1.</span><span class="cl">(Rav Chisda):</span> If his wife was a minor, and he spent money on her property, he is like one who spends on a stranger's property. (If he consumed less than he spent, he is paid like a sharecropper.)</p>
<p class="bas indent2"><span class="nm">2.</span>Since he is unsure if he will keep the property (perhaps she will do Mi'un), Chachamim enacted (that he is paid like a sharecropper) so that he will work the property properly (and not try to reap a quick profit, causing a long term loss). Also regarding a captive, he is unsure whether the captive will return!</p>
<p class="bas indent1"><span class="nm">(j)</span><span class="cl">Question:</span> The Beraisa said 'regarding all of them, the overseer is paid like a sharecropper.' What does this come to include?</p>
<p class="bas subject"><span class="nm">2)</span>APPOINTING RELATIVES</p>
<p class="bas indent1"><span class="nm">(a)</span><span class="cl">Answer:</span> It includes Rav Nachman's case.</p>
<p class="bas indent2"><span class="nm">1.</span><span class="cl">(Rav Nachman citing Shmuel):</span> We appoint a relative over property of a captive; but not over property of someone who willingly went abroad.</p>
<p class="bas indent2"><span class="nm">2.</span><span class="cl">(Rav Nachman himself):</span> One who flees is like a captive.</p>
<p class="bas indent2"><span class="nm">3.</span><span class="cl">Question:</span> Why did he flee?</p>
<p class="bas indent3"><span class="nm">i.</span>If it was to avoid the head-tax, he willingly left!</p>
<p class="bas indent2"><span class="nm">4.</span><span class="cl">Answer:</span> Rather, he had killed someone, and feared that he would be killed.</p>
<p class="bas indent1"><span class="nm">(b)</span><span class="cl">(Rav Yehudah):</span> If one was captured before harvesting his standing crop, grapes, dates or olives, Beis Din appoints an overseer to harvest them, then they appoint a relative over the property.</p>
<p class="bas indent1"><span class="nm">(c)</span><span class="cl">Question:</span> They should appoint an overseer permanently!</p>
<p class="bas indent1"><span class="nm">(d)</span><span class="cl">Answer:</span> We do not appoint (strangers to be) overseers for adults. (We do so only for children. This is a Mitzvah for which people volunteer.)</p>
<p class="bas indent1"><span class="nm">(e)</span><span class="cl">(Rav Huna):</span> We do not appoint a minor over property of a captive, nor a relative over property of a minor, nor a relative of a relative of a minor.</p>
<p class="bas indent2"><span class="nm">1.</span>We do not appoint a minor over property of a captive, lest he cause a loss;</p>
<p class="bas indent2"><span class="nm">2.</span>We do not appoint a relative of a relative of a minor, such as a maternal brother (of the minor's brother), nor a relative of the minor, lest they make a Chazakah and claim the land for themselves (since no one protests).</p>
<p class="bas indent1"><span class="nm">(f)</span><span class="cl">(Rava):</span> We learn from Rav Huna that one cannot make a Chazakah in property of minors, even if he remains on the land three years after the minor matures.</p>
<p class="bas bbbline">39b----------------------------------------39b</p>
<p class="bas indent2"><span class="nm">1.</span>We are concerned only for relatives such as paternal uncles (who could claim that he inherited it), not maternal uncles.</p>
<p class="bas indent2"><span class="nm">2.</span>Even paternal uncles are forbidden only for land, but not for houses (since the neighbors know that it belongs to the minor).</p>
<p class="bas indent2"><span class="nm">3.</span>Even land is permitted if a document of division of the inheritance was written, for this has publicity.</p>
<p class="bas indent2"><span class="nm">4.</span><span class="cl">Rejection:</span> All these three points are wrong. We never make a relative an overseer on a minor's property.</p>
<p class="bas indent1"><span class="nm">(g)</span>A case occurred in which Leah and one of her three daughters (Chanah) were captured. One of the remaining daughters died, leaving a child (Reuven).</p>
<p class="bas indent1"><span class="nm">(h)</span><span class="cl">(Abaye):</span> We cannot appoint the remaining daughter (Dinah) over the property. Perhaps Leah died (and Reuven owns some of the property), and we do not appoint a relative over a minor's property!</p>
<p class="bas indent2"><span class="nm">1.</span>We cannot appoint the child over the property. Perhaps Leah is alive, and we do not appoint a minor over a captive's property!</p>
<p class="bas indent2"><span class="nm">2.</span>Therefore, Dinah oversees half the property, and we appoint a stranger to oversee half. (We are concerned lest Leah and Chanah both died. If we would know that Leah died and Chanah is alive, we could appoint Dinah over two thirds.)</p>
<p class="bas indent1"><span class="nm">(i)</span><span class="cl">(Rava):</span> Once we must appoint a stranger to oversee half, we appoint him over all the property.</p>
<p class="bas indent1"><span class="nm">(j)</span>Later, they heard that Leah died.</p>
<p class="bas indent1"><span class="nm">(k)</span><span class="cl">(Abaye):</span> We give a third of the property to Dinah (surely, she inherits at least a third.) We give a third to Reuven. (If Chanah is alive, she owns the last third. If not, Dinah and the child split it.) Dinah oversees a sixth (half of the last third), and we appoint a stranger to oversee the other sixth.</p>
<p class="bas indent1"><span class="nm">(l)</span><span class="cl">(Rava):</span> Once we must appoint a stranger to oversee a sixth, we appoint him over both sixths.</p>
<p class="bas subject"><span class="nm">3)</span>TESTIMONY AGAINST POWERFUL PEOPLE</p>
<p class="bas indent1"><span class="nm">(a)</span>Ploni came from Bei Chuzai and said that he is the brother of Mari bar Isak, and asked to divide the inheritance of their father. Mari denied knowing him.</p>
<p class="bas indent1"><span class="nm">(b)</span><span class="cl">Rav Chisda:</span> It is reasonable that Mari would not recognize his brother - "Hem Lo Hikiruhu (Yosef's brothers did not recognize him)" because Yosef left them before he had a beard, and now he had a beard;</p>
<p class="bas indent2"><span class="nm">1.</span>Ploni must bring witnesses that he is a brother in order to share the inheritance.</p>
<p class="bas indent1"><span class="nm">(c)</span><span class="cl">Ploni:</span> I have witnesses, but they fear Mari, for he is powerful!</p>
<p class="bas indent1"><span class="nm">(d)</span><span class="cl">Rav Chisda:</span> Mari must bring (those witnesses, or other) witnesses to testify that Ploni is not his brother.</p>
<p class="bas indent1"><span class="nm">(e)</span><span class="cl">Mari:</span> Is that the law?! The one who seeks to take money from another, he must bring proof!</p>
<p class="bas indent1"><span class="nm">(f)</span><span class="cl">Rav Chisda:</span> This is the law for powerful people.</p>
<p class="bas indent1"><span class="nm">(g)</span><span class="cl">Mari:</span> If you are concerned that they fear me, even if witnesses testify for me, it will not help!</p>
<p class="bas indent1"><span class="nm">(h)</span><span class="cl">Rav Chisda:</span> Witnesses would not transgress two matters due to fear. (They would withhold testimony, but they would not lie or deny what they know.)</p>
<p class="bas indent1"><span class="nm">(i)</span>Witnesses testified that Ploni is his brother. Ploni asked for half the vineyards and orchards, even though Mari had improved them.</p>
<p class="bas indent1"><span class="nm">(j)</span><span class="cl">Rav Chisda:</span> Ploni is correct:</p>
<p class="bas indent2"><span class="nm">1.</span><span class="cl">(Mishnah):</span> If Reuven died, leaving minor and adult children, and the adults improved the property, the minors share in the improvements.</p>
