<p class="bas subject"><span class="nm">1)</span>IDEAL RAIN</p>
<p class="bas indent1"><span class="nm">(a)</span><span class="cl">(Beraisa):</span> The Pasuk about Hash-m giving rain in its proper time means that it will neither soak the people nor leave them thirsty but will be in the correct amount.</p>
<p class="bas indent2"><span class="nm">1.</span>Too much rain washes away the soil and prevents produce.</p>
<p class="bas indent1"><span class="nm">(b)</span><span class="cl">(Alternate explanation):</span> "In its proper time" means that on Tuesday and Friday nights.</p>
<p class="bas indent2"><span class="nm">1.</span>Such rain fell in the time of R. Shimon b. Shetach and caused the produce to grow to great size.</p>
<p class="bas indent2"><span class="nm">2.</span>They preserved samples as a lesson in what sin might be withholding.</p>
<p class="bas indent2"><span class="nm">3.</span>Likewise in the days of Hurdus, when they were building the Beis ha'Mikdash, the rain fell by night.</p>
<p class="bas indent1"><span class="nm">(c)</span>By day, the sun shone, and the people knew that their work was for Heaven.</p>
<p class="bas subject"><span class="nm">2)</span>CHONI HA'ME'AGEL AND THE RAIN</p>
<p class="bas indent1"><span class="nm">(a)</span><span class="cl">(Beraisa):</span> It happened once that most of Adar had passed and there was still no rain.</p>
<p class="bas indent1"><span class="nm">(b)</span>Choni ha'Me'agel was asked to pray for rain, but was unsuccessful.</p>
<p class="bas indent1"><span class="nm">(c)</span>He drew a circle, stood inside, and told Hash-m that he wouldn't move until rain fell.</p>
<p class="bas indent1"><span class="nm">(d)</span>The rain began to trickle, and his students said that the Heavens were trying to release him from his oath.</p>
<p class="bas indent1"><span class="nm">(e)</span>Choni asked for substantial rain, and it fell strongly in huge drops.</p>
<p class="bas indent1"><span class="nm">(f)</span>When his students said that it would destroy them, he asked for rain of blessing.</p>
<p class="bas indent1"><span class="nm">(g)</span>The rain fell appropriately, until everyone had to seek refuge on Har ha'Bayis.</p>
<p class="bas indent1"><span class="nm">(h)</span>When asked to pray that the rain should stop, Choni replied that one should not pray about too much good; but he took a cow as a thanks-offering and said to Hash-m that the people cannot accept too much good.</p>
<p class="bas indent1"><span class="nm">(i)</span>The rain stopped, the sun shone, and the people gathered mushrooms from the fields.</p>
<p class="bas indent1"><span class="nm">(j)</span>Shimon b. Shetach said that Choni deserved to be excommunicated; had Eliyahu decreed no rain, and Chon reversed it, it would have been a Chilul Hash-m.</p>
<p class="bas indent2"><span class="nm">1.</span>But he said that he was powerless, as Choni was before Hash-m like a child whose father fulfills his every request.</p>
<p class="bas indent1"><span class="nm">(k)</span>The Sanhedrin sent praise to Choni, expounding Pesukim to speak of how his prayers had helped.</p>
<p class="bas subject"><span class="nm">3)</span>CHONI HA'ME'AGEL AND THE BIG SLEEP</p>
<p class="bas indent1"><span class="nm">(a)</span><span class="cl">(R. Yochanan):</span> Choni was always troubled by the Pasuk which referred to Galus Bavel as a dream - how can one sleep for seventy years?</p>
<p class="bas indent1"><span class="nm">(b)</span>He once met a man planting a carob tree, and asked when it would bear fruit.</p>
<p class="bas indent1"><span class="nm">(c)</span>When the man replied that it would take seventy years, Choni asked how he expected to benefit.</p>
<p class="bas indent1"><span class="nm">(d)</span>The man replied that his ancestors planted it for him, and he was planting it for his descendants.</p>
<p class="bas indent1"><span class="nm">(e)</span>Choni fell asleep, and when he awoke, he saw a man harvesting the carobs.</p>
<p class="bas indent1"><span class="nm">(f)</span>The man turned out to be the grandson of the original man, and Choni realized that he had slept for seventy years.</p>
<p class="bas indent1"><span class="nm">(g)</span>Choni's son was no longer alive, but his grandson was.</p>
<p class="bas indent1"><span class="nm">(h)</span>Nobody believed who he was, despite his being able to answer all their difficulties.</p>
<p class="bas indent1"><span class="nm">(i)</span>Lacking the appropriate respect, he was grieved and prayed to die.</p>
<p class="bas indent1"><span class="nm">(j)</span><span class="cl">(Rava):</span> Thus people say, "Either friends or death."</p>
<p class="bas subject"><span class="nm">4)</span>THE HABITS OF ABA CHILKIYAH</p>
<p class="bas indent1"><span class="nm">(a)</span>Aba Chilkiyah, Choni's grandson, would be asked to pray for rain when it was needed.</p>
<p class="bas indent1"><span class="nm">(b)</span>Once, the rabbis found him plowing in the field; he did not respond to their greeting.</p>
<p class="bas bbbline">23b----------------------------------------23b</p>
<p class="bas indent1"><span class="nm">(c)</span>Later, when collecting firewood, he placed it on one shoulder and his cloak on the other shoulder.</p>
<p class="bas indent1"><span class="nm">(d)</span>He did not wear shoes except when he had to cross water.</p>
<p class="bas indent1"><span class="nm">(e)</span>When he had to cross thorns, he lifted up his clothing.</p>
<p class="bas indent1"><span class="nm">(f)</span>Arriving home, his wife wore make-up to greet him.</p>
<p class="bas indent1"><span class="nm">(g)</span>She entered the house, then him, then the rabbis.</p>
<p class="bas indent1"><span class="nm">(h)</span>he did not invite the rabbis to join his family in their meal.</p>
<p class="bas indent1"><span class="nm">(i)</span>He gave his older son one loaf of bread and two to the younger son.</p>
<p class="bas indent1"><span class="nm">(j)</span>He told his wife that the rabbis had come about the rain, so they should go pray on the roof and perhaps be spared taking credit for it.</p>
<p class="bas indent1"><span class="nm">(k)</span>They went to the roof and stood in opposite corners; the clouds approached his wife first.</p>
<p class="bas indent1"><span class="nm">(l)</span>Upon descending, he asked the rabbis why they had come.</p>
<p class="bas indent1"><span class="nm">(m)</span>When they replied that they came to ask him for rain, he blessed Hash-m that he was not needed.</p>
<p class="bas indent1"><span class="nm">(n)</span>They said that they knew the rain fell in his merit, and asked him to explain all of his actions.</p>
<p class="bas indent2"><span class="nm">1.</span>He did not respond to their greeting as he was a worker hired for his time.</p>
<p class="bas indent2"><span class="nm">2.</span>He put the firewood on the shoulder without the cloak as the cloak was borrowed, and not for that purpose.</p>
<p class="bas indent2"><span class="nm">3.</span>He only wore shoes while walking through water as only then was he unable to see what he was stepping on.</p>
<p class="bas indent2"><span class="nm">4.</span>He lifted his clothes amongst thorns as flesh heals but clothing doesn't.</p>
<p class="bas indent2"><span class="nm">5.</span>His wife wore make-up to greet him so that he should not think of other women.</p>
<p class="bas indent2"><span class="nm">6.</span>His wife entered before him so that she should not be left outside with the rabbis (who he did not know).</p>
<p class="bas indent2"><span class="nm">7.</span>He did not offer the rabbis food as he did not have enough and he did not want to take credit for an offer that he could not honor.</p>
<p class="bas indent2"><span class="nm">8.</span>He gave more bread to the younger son as he had been away at yeshivah and had not eaten.</p>
<p class="bas indent2"><span class="nm">9.</span>His wife's prayers were answered first as she gave food directly to the poor, whereas he only gave them money to buy food.</p>
<p class="bas indent2"><span class="nm">10.</span>Alternately, he prayed that the local bandits should die, whereas she prayed that they should repent, which they did.</p>
<p class="bas subject"><span class="nm">5)</span>PEOPLE WHO COULD BRING RAIN</p>
<p class="bas indent1"><span class="nm">(a)</span>Chanan ha'Nichva was the grandson of Choni ha'Me'agel.</p>
<p class="bas indent1"><span class="nm">(b)</span>When there was a need for rain, the rabbis would send children to him; they would tug his cloak and beg for rain.</p>
<p class="bas indent1"><span class="nm">(c)</span>He would pray to Hash-m to give rain for the sake of the children that could not discern who was really giving it.</p>
<p class="bas indent2"><span class="nm">1.</span>He was so called because he would conceal himself (Machvi) while relieving himself.</p>
<p class="bas indent1"><span class="nm">(d)</span>The difference between the mighty ones of Eretz Yisrael and the pious ones of Bavel is that the latter had to pray for rain in groups.</p>
<p class="bas indent1"><span class="nm">(e)</span>The former, such as R. Yonah, could pray for rain alone; he would say that he was going to buy grain, but would instead pray that rain should fall, and then tell his family that it was plentiful.</p>
<p class="bas indent2"><span class="nm">1.</span>R. Mani, his son, was being molested by the people of the prince's house.</p>
<p class="bas indent2"><span class="nm">2.</span>He prayed at his father's grave, and their horses legs became trapped until they consented to stop bothering him.</p>
<p class="bas indent2"><span class="nm">3.</span>He told R. Yitzchak b. Elyashav that members of his father-in-law's householf were opressing him, and he prayed that they should become poor.</p>
<p class="bas indent2"><span class="nm">4.</span>But when they grew overly dependant on R. Mani's charity, he prayed for them to grow wealthy again.</p>
<p class="bas indent2"><span class="nm">5.</span>He told R. Yitzchak that he was not attracted to his wife, so he prayed for her to become beautiful.</p>
<p class="bas indent2"><span class="nm">6.</span>But R. Mani told him that she had become conceited, so he prayed for her to return to her ugliness.</p>
<p class="bas indent2"><span class="nm">7.</span>Two students of R. Yiztchak b. Elyashiv asked him to pray that they should become wiser, but he told them that he no longer possessed the power.</p>
