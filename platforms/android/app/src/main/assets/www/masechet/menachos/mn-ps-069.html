<div class="subject"><span class="nm">1)</span><p>WHICH PRODUCE BECOMES PERMITTED?</p></div>
<div class="indent1"><span class="nm">(a)</span><p><span class="cl">Question (Rami bar Chama):</span> How developed must fruits be in order that Shtei ha'Lechem will permit it? Do we require Hanatzah (sprouting) or Chanatah (budding)?</p></div>
<div class="indent2"><span class="nm">1.</span><p><span class="cl">Question:</span> Which Hanatzah and Chanatah does he refer to?</p></div>
<div class="indent3"><span class="nm">i.</span><p><span class="cl">Suggestion:</span> He refers to that of the fruit.</p></div>
<div class="indent3"><span class="nm">ii.</span><p><span class="cl">Rejection:</span> Hashrashah suffices for grain to be permitted by the Omer. Surely Hanatzah and (all the more so) Chanatah permit fruit!</p></div>
<div class="indent2"><span class="nm">2.</span><p><span class="cl">Answer:</span> He refers to that of the leaves;</p></div>
<div class="indent3"><span class="nm">i.</span><p>He asks whether Hanatzah of leaves is like Hashrashah, or if Chanatah is like Hashrashah.</p></div>
<div class="indent1"><span class="nm">(b)</span><p>This question is not resolved.</p></div>
<div class="subject"><span class="nm">2)</span><p>IS PLANTED WHEAT LIKE LAND?</p></div>
<div class="indent1"><span class="nm">(a)</span><p><span class="cl">Question #1 (Rabah bar bar Chanan):</span> If (harvested) wheat was replanted in the ground, does the Omer permit it?</p></div>
<div class="indent2"><span class="nm">1.</span><p><span class="cl">Question:</span> Whether or not it took root, a Mishnah answers this!</p></div>
<div class="indent3"><span class="nm">i.</span><p><span class="cl">(Mishnah):</span> If it took root before the Omer, the Omer permits it. If not, it is forbidden until next year's Omer.</p></div>
<div class="indent2"><span class="nm">2.</span><p><span class="cl">Answer:</span> The case is, he harvested and planted it before the Omer, and the Omer passed (before Hashrashah). May he uproot it and eat it?</p></div>
<div class="indent3"><span class="nm">i.</span><p>If it is as if the wheat is in a box, the Omer permits it. If it is Batel to the ground (like wheat that is growing), it is forbidden until the next Omer.</p></div>
<div class="indent1"><span class="nm">(b)</span><p><span class="cl">Question #2:</span> Does Ona'ah (overcharging) apply to it?</p></div>
<div class="indent2"><span class="nm">1.</span><p><span class="cl">Question:</span> What is the case?</p></div>
<div class="indent2"><span class="nm">2.</span><p><span class="cl">Answer #1:</span> Reuven paid Shimon to plant six measures of wheat and witnesses testify that he planted only five.</p></div>
<div class="indent2"><span class="nm">3.</span><p><span class="cl">Rejection:</span> Surely Reuven does not pardon the missing measure!</p></div>
<div class="indent3"><span class="nm">i.</span><p><span class="cl">(Rava):</span> If the wrong measure, weight or number was given, even if the error is less than a sixth, the sale is invalid (Rashi; Rambam - the sale stands, but the additional amount must be given or returned).</p></div>
<div class="indent2"><span class="nm">4.</span><p><span class="cl">Answer #2:</span> Reuven paid Shimon to plant his field properly, witnesses testify that he planted improperly.</p></div>
<div class="indent3"><span class="nm">i.</span><p>If we consider the wheat to be in a box, Ona'ah applies to it (like all other Metaltelim, i.e. movable objects);</p></div>
<div class="indent3"><span class="nm">ii.</span><p>If it is Batel to the ground, it is like land, so Ona'ah does not apply to it.</p></div>
<div class="indent1"><span class="nm">(c)</span><p><span class="cl">Question #3:</span> Does one swear about it?</p></div>
<div class="indent2"><span class="nm">1.</span><p>If it is like wheat in a box, it is Metaltelim, so we swear about it;</p></div>
<div class="indent2"><span class="nm">2.</span><p>If it is Batel to the ground, it is like land, so we do not swear about it.</p></div>
<div class="indent1"><span class="nm">(d)</span><p>These questions are not resolved.</p></div>
<div class="subject"><span class="nm">3)</span><p>WASTE AFTER DIGESTION</p></div>
<div class="indent1"><span class="nm">(a)</span><p><span class="cl">Question (Rami bar Chama):</span> If wheat or barley is in animal excrement, what is the law?</p></div>
<div class="indent2"><span class="nm">1.</span><p><span class="cl">Question:</span> What does he ask about?</p></div>
<div class="indent2"><span class="nm">2.</span><p><span class="cl">Answer #1:</span> He asks whether it has Tum'as Ochlim.</p></div>
<div class="indent2"><span class="nm">3.</span><p><span class="cl">Rejection:</span> A Mishnah teaches this!</p></div>
<div class="indent3"><span class="nm">i.</span><p><span class="cl">(Mishnah):</span> If wheat or barley is in animal excrement and one intended to eat it, it is not Mekabel Tum'as Ochlim;</p></div>
<div class="indent3"><span class="nm">ii.</span><p>If he picked it out of the excrement in order to eat it, it is Mekabel Tum'as Ochlim.</p></div>
<div class="indent2"><span class="nm">4.</span><p><span class="cl">Answer #2:</span> He asks whether it may be used for Menachos.</p></div>
<div class="indent2"><span class="nm">5.</span><p><span class="cl">Objection:</span> Obviously, it may not be used, due to "Hakrivehu Na l'Fechasecha..."! (A human governor would not accept a gift of a sickly animal. All the more so we should not offer repulsive Korbanos!)</p></div>
<div class="indent2"><span class="nm">6.</span><p><span class="cl">Answer #3:</span> The case is, he removed the grain and planted it. He asks whether what grows may be used for Menachos;</p></div>
<div class="indent3"><span class="nm">i.</span><p>If grain in excrement is Pasul because it is repulsive, what grows from it is not repulsive (it may be used);</p></div>
<div class="indent3"><span class="nm">ii.</span><p>If grain in excrement is Pasul because it is inferior (because it was digested), what grows from it will also be inferior. (It is Pasul.)</p></div>
<div class="indent1"><span class="nm">(b)</span><p>This question is not resolved.</p></div>
<div class="indent1"><span class="nm">(c)</span><p><span class="cl">Question (Rami bar Chama):</span> If an elephant swallowed a basket, and excreted it, what is the law?</p></div>
<div class="indent2"><span class="nm">1.</span><p><span class="cl">Question:</span> About what does he ask?</p></div>
<div class="indent2"><span class="nm">2.</span><p><span class="cl">Answer #1:</span> He asks it became Tahor.</p></div>
<div class="indent2"><span class="nm">3.</span><p><span class="cl">Rejection:</span> A Mishnah teaches this!</p></div>
<div class="indent3"><span class="nm">i.</span><p><span class="cl">(Mishnah):</span> (If one is making a Kli,) intent (to use it like it is now) causes it to be Mekabel Tum'ah. A physical change is needed to be Metaher. (Intent to fix it for a different use does not suffice. Here, there was no physical change!)</p></div>
<div class="indent2"><span class="nm">4.</span><p><span class="cl">Answer #2:</span> The case is, it swallowed reeds, and they were made into a wicker basket;</p></div>
<div class="indent3"><span class="nm">i.</span><p>If we consider the reeds to have been digested, the basket is a dung Kli, which is not Mekabel Tum'ah. If not, it is Mekabel Tum'ah;</p></div>
<div class="bbbline">69b----------------------------------------69b</p></div>
<div class="indent3"><span class="nm">ii.</span><p><span class="cl">(Mishnah):</span> Kelim made of stone, dung or earth are not Mekabel Tum'ah, not mid'Oraisa nor mid'Rabanan.</p></div>
<div class="indent1"><span class="nm">(d)</span><p><span class="cl">Answer #1:</span> We learn from Ula!</p></div>
<div class="indent2"><span class="nm">1.</span><p><span class="cl">(Ula):</span> A case occurred in which wolves swallowed two babies in Ever ha'Yarden (and excreted them). Chachamim were Metaher the flesh.</p></div>
<div class="indent1"><span class="nm">(e)</span><p><span class="cl">Rejection:</span> We cannot learn from there, for flesh is soft. (It is more easily digested than reeds.)</p></div>
<div class="indent1"><span class="nm">(f)</span><p><span class="cl">Answer #2:</span> We learn from the end of that teaching!</p></div>
<div class="indent2"><span class="nm">1.</span><p><span class="cl">(Ula):</span> Chachamim were Metamei the bones.</p></div>
<div class="indent1"><span class="nm">(g)</span><p><span class="cl">Rejection:</span> We cannot learn from there, for bones are hard.</p></div>
<div class="subject"><span class="nm">4)</span><p>WHEAT FROM THE CLOUDS</p></div>
<div class="indent1"><span class="nm">(a)</span><p><span class="cl">Question (R. Zeira):</span> If wheat fell with rain (Rashi - wheat from a ship was absorbed in clouds; Tosfos - it was a miracle), what is the law?</p></div>
<div class="indent2"><span class="nm">1.</span><p><span class="cl">Question:</span> What does he ask about?</p></div>
<div class="indent3"><span class="nm">i.</span><p>Surely, he does not ask whether it is Kosher for Menachos. There is no reason to disqualify!</p></div>
<div class="indent2"><span class="nm">2.</span><p><span class="cl">Answer:</span> He asks whether it is Kosher for Shtei ha'Lechem;</p></div>
<div class="indent3"><span class="nm">i.</span><p>Shtei ha'Lechem must come "mi'Moshvoseichem (from where you dwell)." This excludes Chutz la'Aretz, but it may come from clouds;</p></div>
<div class="indent3"><span class="nm">ii.</span><p>Or, perhaps it excludes also clouds!</p></div>
<div class="indent2"><span class="nm">3.</span><p><span class="cl">Question:</span> Would this ever occur?!</p></div>
<div class="indent2"><span class="nm">4.</span><p><span class="cl">Answer:</span> Yes! A case occurred, and a field three Parsa'os (about 12 kilometers) long was covered with a Tefach of wheat.</p></div>
<div class="subject"><span class="nm">5)</span><p>IS THE GROWTH BATEL TO THE IKAR?</p></div>
<div class="indent1"><span class="nm">(a)</span><p><span class="cl">Question (R. Shimon ben Pazi):</span> If an ear of grain was a third grown before the Omer, and it was detached and replanted after the Omer and it grew (a little), what is the law?</p></div>
<div class="indent2"><span class="nm">1.</span><p>If the law depends on the Ikar (what was planted), the Omer permitted it. (The additional growth is Batel. Also it is permitted);</p></div>
<div class="indent2"><span class="nm">2.</span><p>If the law depends on the new growth, it is not permitted until next year's Omer.</p></div>
<div class="indent2"><span class="nm">3.</span><p><span class="cl">Question:</span> He should learn from either of the following (that the Ikar determines the law)!</p></div>
<div class="indent3"><span class="nm">i.</span><p><span class="cl">(R. Avahu):</span> If a young branch (i.e. of a tree within the three years of Orlah) with fruits was grafted onto an old tree, even if the fruits grew an additional 200 times their (initial) size, they are forbidden.</p></div>
<div class="indent3"><span class="nm">ii.</span><p><span class="cl">(R. Shmuel bar Nachmani):</span> If an onion was planted in a vineyard and the vines were removed, even if it grew an additional 200 times its size, it is forbidden.</p></div>
<div class="indent2"><span class="nm">4.</span><p><span class="cl">Answer:</span> R. Shimon ben Pazi asks about the rulings of R. Avahu and R. Shmuel;</p></div>
<div class="indent3"><span class="nm">i.</span><p>Are they sure that the Ikar determines the law, even if this is a leniency?</p></div>
<div class="indent3"><span class="nm">ii.</span><p>Or, perhaps they are unsure. They are concerned for stringencies of the Ikar and of the additional growth!</p></div>
<div class="indent1"><span class="nm">(b)</span><p>This question is not resolved.</p></div>
