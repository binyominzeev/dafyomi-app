<p class="bas subject"><span class="nm">1)</span>IS ONE WHO DENIED SUSPECTED TO SWEAR FALSELY?</p>
<p class="bas indent1"><span class="nm">(a)</span><span class="cl">Support:</span> Rav Idi bar Avin taught that if one denied a loan (and it was found that he really owed), he may testify (we assume that he intended to stall, not to steal);</p>
<p class="bas indent2"><span class="nm">1.</span>One who denied a deposit (and it was found that he could have returned it immediately) is disqualified from testimony.</p>
<p class="bas indent1"><span class="nm">(b)</span><span class="cl">Question:</span> Ilfa taught that an oath acquires (liability for Ones)!</p>
<p class="bas indent2"><span class="nm">1.</span><span class="cl">Inference:</span> Denial does not acquire!</p>
<p class="bas indent1"><span class="nm">(c)</span><span class="cl">Answer #1:</span> Here also, the deposit is in the swamp.</p>
<p class="bas indent1"><span class="nm">(d)</span><span class="cl">Answer #2:</span> Ilfa said that an oath acquires (not liability for Ones, rather,) like Rav Huna taught;</p>
<p class="bas indent2"><span class="nm">1.</span><span class="cl">(Rav Huna citing Rav):</span> If Reuven denied owing money to Shimon and swore, and later, witnesses said that he owes Shimon, he is exempt;</p>
<p class="bas indent2"><span class="nm">2.</span>"The owner will take, and he (the defendant) will not pay" - once the owner received (heard) an oath, the defendant need not pay.</p>
<p class="bas subject"><span class="nm">2)</span>MUST ONE PAY AFTER SWEARING?</p>
<p class="bas indent1"><span class="nm">(a)</span><span class="cl">(Rav Huna citing Rav):</span> If Reuven denied owing money to Shimon and swore, and later, witnesses said that he owes Shimon, he is exempt;</p>
<p class="bas indent2"><span class="nm">1.</span>"The owner will take, and he (the defendant) will not pay" - once the owner received (heard) an oath, the defendant need not pay.</p>
<p class="bas indent1"><span class="nm">(b)</span><span class="cl">(Rava):</span> Presumably, Rav's law applies only to a loan, for a borrower acquires the money. One can say that the oath is in place of repayment;</p>
<p class="bas indent2"><span class="nm">1.</span>A deposit always belongs to the owner, Reuven cannot acquire it through an oath!</p>
<p class="bas indent2"><span class="nm">2.</span>However, Rav said his law even regarding a deposit, for the verse he expounds discusses a deposit! (Chasam Sofer (Chulin 40a) – this is like Rav holds, that a thief tunneling into a house acquires through his blood. Marcheshes (2:29:16) – once he swears, the owner despairs. Agra d'Kalah – also one who imposes an oath is punished, for he should have pardoned his money to avoid the need for a Shevu'ah. Therefore, he never collects later.)</p>
<p class="bas indent1"><span class="nm">(c)</span><span class="cl">Question (Rav Acha bar Minyomi - Mishnah):</span> If Levi accepted (answered 'Amen' to) an oath that the deposit he was guarding for Yehudah was lost; and witnesses testified that he ate it, he pays principal;</p>
<p class="bas indent2"><span class="nm">1.</span>If Levi admitted by himself, he pays principal and Chomesh and brings an Asham.</p>
<p class="bas indent1"><span class="nm">(d)</span><span class="cl">Answer (Rav Nachman):</span> The case is, he swore outside of Beis Din.</p>
<p class="bas indent1"><span class="nm">(e)</span><span class="cl">Question (Rav Acha bar Minyomi - Seifa):</span> If Levi accepted an oath that the deposit was stolen, and witnesses testified that he ate it, he pays Kefel;</p>
<p class="bas indent2"><span class="nm">1.</span>If Levi admitted by himself, he pays principal, the Chomesh and brings an Asham.</p>
<p class="bas indent2"><span class="nm">2.</span>One does not pay Kefel for an oath taken outside of Beis Din!</p>
<p class="bas indent1"><span class="nm">(f)</span><span class="cl">Answer #1 (Rav Nachman):</span> I could say that the Reisha of the Mishnah discusses outside of Beis Din, and the Seifa discusses in Beis Din, but that is a poor answer.</p>
<p class="bas indent1"><span class="nm">(g)</span><span class="cl">Answer #2 (Rav Nachman):</span> The entire Mishnah is in Beis Din;</p>
<p class="bas indent2"><span class="nm">1.</span>In the Reisha, Levi swore before Beis Din told him to. (Rav's law and) the Seifa discuss(es) when Beis Din administered the oath.</p>
<p class="bas indent1"><span class="nm">(h)</span><span class="cl">Rami bar Chama (to Rav Nachman):</span> You do not hold like Rav. What forces you to (explain the Mishnah in such a way to) answer for him?</p>
<p class="bas indent1"><span class="nm">(i)</span><span class="cl">Rav Nachman:</span> I just explain how Rav must learn the Mishnah.</p>
<p class="bas indent1"><span class="nm">(j)</span><span class="cl">Question:</span> Rav learns from a verse. How can anyone argue with him?</p>
<p class="bas indent1"><span class="nm">(k)</span><span class="cl">Answer:</span> The verse teaches that in every oath mid'Oraisa, the oath exempts one from paying. The one who is asked to pay swears and is then exempt</p>
<p class="bas indent2"><span class="nm">1.</span>"The owner will take (hear the oath) and he (the Shomer) will not pay" - the one who was asked to pay, he swears.</p>
<p class="bas indent1"><span class="nm">(l)</span><span class="cl">Question (Rav Hamnuna - Mishnah):</span> If Reuven made Shimon swear five times, whether in or outside of Beis Din (and he swore falsely), he is liable (an Chomesh and an Asham) for each oath;</p>
<p class="bas indent2"><span class="nm">1.</span>R. Shimon says, the reason is, each time he could have admitted.</p>
<p class="bas indent2"><span class="nm">2.</span>We cannot say that he swore by himself. It says that Reuven made him swear!</p>
<p class="bas indent2"><span class="nm">3.</span>We cannot say that (this is only when) he swore outside of Beis Din. It says, (even) in Beis Din!</p>
<p class="bas indent1"><span class="nm">(m)</span><span class="cl">Answer (Rav Hamnuna):</span> The Beraisa discusses two cases:</p>
<p class="bas indent2"><span class="nm">1.</span>When he made him swear, it discusses outside of Beis Din</p>
<p class="bas indent2"><span class="nm">2.</span>When he swore by himself, it discusses in Beis Din.</p>
<p class="bas indent1"><span class="nm">(n)</span><span class="cl">Question (Rava - Beraisa):</span> If a Shomer claimed that the deposit was stolen, and he swore falsely, admitted that he lied, and witnesses testified that the Shomer himself took it:</p>
<p class="bas indent2"><span class="nm">1.</span>If he admitted before witnesses came, he pays principal and Chomesh, and brings an Asham.</p>
<p class="bas indent2"><span class="nm">2.</span>We cannot say that he swore outside of Beis Din or by himself. It says that (when witnesses testified) he pays Kefel!</p>
<p class="bas indent1"><span class="nm">(o)</span><span class="cl">Answer (Rava):</span> Rav taught that he does not pay. He did not discuss when he admits;</p>
<p class="bas indent2"><span class="nm">1.</span>It says "he will confess" - whether he originally swore that it was lost or stolen, he must pay the principal and the Chomesh (and bring an Asham)!</p>
<p class="bas indent2"><span class="nm">2.</span>Also - if he claimed that a deposit was stolen, and witnesses testified that he stole it, Rav admits that he pays - the Torah obligated him to pay Kefel!</p>
<p class="bas indent2"><span class="nm">3.</span>Rav's law is only when he claimed and swore that it was lost, and did not admit, and witnesses testified that he stole it.</p>
<p class="bas indent1"><span class="nm">(p)</span>Rav Gamda said Rava's answer in front of Rav Ashi.</p>
<p class="bas indent1"><span class="nm">(q)</span><span class="cl">Question (Rav Ashi):</span> Rav Hamnuna was a Talmid of Rav. Surely, he knew what Rav said, and he asked from a case where he is liable because he could have admitted, because he knew that Rav exempts even when he admits!</p>
<p class="bas bbbline">106b----------------------------------------106b</p>
<p class="bas indent1"><span class="nm">(r)</span><span class="cl">Answer (Rav Acha Sava):</span> Rav Hamnuna asked as follows: granted, if witnesses can obligate (to pay principal) one who already swore (this shows that he owes money), so he must bring a Korban for the last oath, for he could have admitted (his oath denied money);</p>
<p class="bas indent2"><span class="nm">1.</span>But if witnesses cannot obligate one who already swore (it is as if he does not owe money), would he must bring a Korban for the last oath, because he could have admitted (and then he would pay principal)?! He did not admit!</p>
<p class="bas subject"><span class="nm">3)</span>ONE WHO CLAIMS THAT A DEPOSIT WAS STOLEN</p>
<p class="bas indent1"><span class="nm">(a)</span><span class="cl">(R. Chiya bar Aba citing R. Yochanan):</span> If one claimed that a deposit was stolen (and really, he stole it), he pays Kefel. If he slaughtered or sold it, he pays four (if it was a Seh) or five (if it was an ox);</p>
<p class="bas indent2"><span class="nm">1.</span>Just like a thief pays Kefel, and if he slaughtered or sold it, he pays four or five, also one who claims that a deposit was stolen pays Kefel, and if he slaughtered or sold it, he pays four or five.</p>
<p class="bas indent1"><span class="nm">(b)</span><span class="cl">Question:</span> One who claims that a deposit was stolen pays Kefel only if he swore. An actual thief pays Kefel even without swearing!</p>
<p class="bas indent1"><span class="nm">(c)</span><span class="cl">Answer:</span> A Hekesh equates one who claims that a deposit was stolen to a thief (they are written adjacent to each other). We do not challenge a Hekesh!</p>
<p class="bas indent2"><span class="nm">1.</span>This answer is like the opinion that one verse discusses an actual thief, and the other discusses one who claims that a deposit was stolen;</p>
<p class="bas indent1"><span class="nm">(d)</span><span class="cl">Question:</span> According to the opinion that both verses discuss one who claims that a deposit was stolen, how can we answer?</p>
<p class="bas indent1"><span class="nm">(e)</span><span class="cl">Answer:</span> It says "ha'Ganav (the thief)." The 'Hei' teaches that he (one who claims that a deposit was stolen) gets all the laws of a thief.</p>
<p class="bas indent1"><span class="nm">(f)</span><span class="cl">Question (R. Chiya bar Aba - Mishnah):</span> If Shimon claimed that Reuven's deposit was stolen, and Reuven imposed an oath on him; and he answered "Amen", and witnesses testify that Shimon ate it, he pays Kefel.</p>
<p class="bas indent2"><span class="nm">1.</span>If Shimon ate it, he must have slaughtered it first, yet he pays only Kefel!</p>
<p class="bas indent1"><span class="nm">(g)</span><span class="cl">Answer (R. Yochanan):</span> The case is, he ate it without slaughter.</p>
<p class="bas indent1"><span class="nm">(h)</span><span class="cl">Question:</span> Why didn't he answer that he slaughtered it, but it was Tereifah (according to R. Shimon, who holds that slaughter that does not permit the meat is not considered slaughter)?</p>
<p class="bas indent1"><span class="nm">(i)</span><span class="cl">Answer:</span> R. Yochanan holds like R. Meir, who holds that it is considered slaughter.</p>
<p class="bas indent1"><span class="nm">(j)</span><span class="cl">Question:</span> Why didn't he answer that he ate a fetus found inside a slaughtered animal (which is permitted without slaughter)?</p>
<p class="bas indent1"><span class="nm">(k)</span><span class="cl">Answer:</span> R. Yochanan holds like R. Meir, who holds that it must be slaughtered.</p>
<p class="bas indent1"><span class="nm">(l)</span><span class="cl">Question:</span> Why didn't he answer that he was taken to trial, and Beis Din told him "go give to him"?</p>
<p class="bas indent2"><span class="nm">1.</span><span class="cl">(Rava):</span> Once Beis Din says 'go give to him', if he slaughtered or sold, he does not pay four or five;</p>
<p class="bas indent2"><span class="nm">2.</span><span class="cl">Question:</span> What is the reason?</p>
<p class="bas indent2"><span class="nm">3.</span><span class="cl">Answer:</span> Once Beis Din ruled, (the theft is known, so) he has the law of a Gazlan (an open robber), who does not pay four or five.</p>
<p class="bas indent2"><span class="nm">4.</span><span class="cl">(Rava):</span> If Beis Din said "you must give to him", if he slaughtered or sold, he pays four or five;</p>
<p class="bas indent2"><span class="nm">5.</span><span class="cl">Question:</span> What is the reason?</p>
<p class="bas indent2"><span class="nm">6.</span><span class="cl">Answer:</span> This expression is not considered a final ruling, so he still has the law of a Ganav (covert thief), who pays four or five.</p>
<p class="bas indent2"><span class="nm">7.</span><span class="cl">Counter-question:</span> Why didn't he answer that the thief was a partner in the animal, and slaughtered without asking his partner?</p>
<p class="bas indent1"><span class="nm">(m)</span><span class="cl">Answer to both questions:</span> There were other answers that R. Yochanan could have given. He chose one.</p>
<p class="bas indent1"><span class="nm">(n)</span><span class="cl">(R. Chiya bar Aba):</span> If one found an Aveidah and later claimed that it was stolen, he pays Kefel.</p>
<p class="bas indent1"><span class="nm">(o)</span><span class="cl">Question:</span> What is the reason?</p>
<p class="bas indent1"><span class="nm">(p)</span><span class="cl">Answer:</span> "For any Aveidah that he will say (he will pay Kefel)."</p>
<p class="bas indent1"><span class="nm">(q)</span><span class="cl">Question (R. Aba bar Mamal - Beraisa):</span> "When a man will give (to a Shomer... the Shomer must swear... and sometimes pays Kefel for it)" excludes what a minor gives.</p>
<p class="bas indent2"><span class="nm">1.</span><span class="cl">Question:</span> Perhaps that is only if he is still a minor when he claims it back! If he matured and claimed it, what is the source that the Shomer is exempt (from the oath and Kefel)?</p>
<p class="bas indent2"><span class="nm">2.</span><span class="cl">Answer:</span> "The matter of both of them (will be brought to the judges)" - both the giving and claim of the deposit must be the same, i.e. the owner was an adult.</p>
<p class="bas indent2"><span class="nm">3.</span><span class="cl">Summation of question:</span> R. Chiya bar Aba says that a finder pays Kefel regarding an Aveidah, even though no one gave it to the finder!</p>
<p class="bas indent1"><span class="nm">(r)</span><span class="cl">Answer #1 (R. Chiya bar Aba):</span> The Beraisa discusses when the Shomer ate the deposit before the owner (Levi) grew up (Levi has no claim for anything that the Shomer did before Levi matured. However, the finder of the Aveidah swore falsely to an adult owner.)</p>
<p class="bas indent1"><span class="nm">(s)</span><span class="cl">Objection:</span> This implies that if the Shomer ate the deposit after Levi grew up, he is liable;</p>
<p class="bas indent2"><span class="nm">1.</span>If so, why did the Beraisa say that the giving and claim of the deposit must be the same (with an adult)? It should say that the eating and claim of the deposit must be the same!</p>
<p class="bas indent1"><span class="nm">(t)</span><span class="cl">Answer #2 (Rav Ashi):</span> An Aveidah is different, because it came through (being lost by) an adult, unlike the deposit of a minor.</p>
<p class="bas subject"><span class="nm">4)</span>MUST THE <i>SHOMER</i> PARTIALLY DENY THE CLAIM?</p>
<p class="bas indent1"><span class="nm">(a)</span><span class="cl">(R. Chiya bar Aba):</span> If a Shomer claimed that a deposited object was stolen, he pays Kefel only if he partially denies the claim and partially admits to the claim.</p>
<p class="bas indent1"><span class="nm">(b)</span><span class="cl">Question:</span> What is the source this?</p>
<p class="bas indent1"><span class="nm">(c)</span><span class="cl">Answer:</span> It says "Ki Hu Zeh (i.e. this he admits to, but he denies something else)".</p>
<p class="bas indent1"><span class="nm">(d)</span>He argues with R. Chiya bar Yosef.</p>
