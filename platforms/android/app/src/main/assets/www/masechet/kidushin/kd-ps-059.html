<p class="bas subject"><span class="nm">1)</span>DECEITFUL DEALINGS</p>
<p class="bas indent1"><span class="nm">(a)</span><span class="cl">Question:</span> Why does our Mishnah discuss telling a friend, and a previous Mishnah (50a) discusses telling a Shali'ach (to be Mekadesh a woman in a certain place)?</p>
<p class="bas indent1"><span class="nm">(b)</span><span class="cl">Answer:</span> In each case, it teaches a bigger Chidush:</p>
<p class="bas indent2"><span class="nm">1.</span>In our Mishnah, one might have thought that it is considered deceit only if a Shali'ach is Mekadesh her to himself, for a man relies on a Shali'ach, but if he asked a friend, it is not called deceit;</p>
<p class="bas indent3"><span class="nm">i.</span>Our Mishnah teaches that this is not so. Even regarding a friend, it is deceit.</p>
<p class="bas indent2"><span class="nm">2.</span>In the previous Mishnah, one might have thought that the Kidushin is invalid only if a friend was Mekadesh her elsewhere, she is not Mekudeshes, for the sender did not expect his friend to exert himself to find her anywhere else. (Therefore, he was authorized to be Mekadesh her only where he specified);</p>
<p class="bas indent3"><span class="nm">i.</span>One expects a Shali'ach to exert himself. One might have thought that the sender merely suggests where to find her, but the Shali'ach is authorized to be Mekadesh her anywhere. The Mishnah teaches that this is not so.</p>
<p class="bas indent1"><span class="nm">(c)</span>Ravin Chasida went to be Mekadesh a woman to his son; he was Mekadesh her to himself.</p>
<p class="bas indent1"><span class="nm">(d)</span><span class="cl">Question:</span> The Beraisa says that this is deceitful!</p>
<p class="bas indent1"><span class="nm">(e)</span><span class="cl">Answer:</span> Her father did not agree to be Mekadesh her to Ravin's son.</p>
<p class="bas indent1"><span class="nm">(f)</span><span class="cl">Question:</span> Ravin should have told his son before being Mekadesh her to himself (to avoid suspicion)!</p>
<p class="bas indent1"><span class="nm">(g)</span><span class="cl">Answer:</span> He was afraid that someone else would be Mekadesh her in the interim.</p>
<p class="bas indent1"><span class="nm">(h)</span>Rabah bar bar Chanah gave money to Rav to buy a certain land. Rav bought it for himself.</p>
<p class="bas indent1"><span class="nm">(i)</span><span class="cl">Question:</span> The Beraisa says that this is deceitful!</p>
<p class="bas indent1"><span class="nm">(j)</span><span class="cl">Answer:</span> The residents of the area were thugs who would not allow (most) people to buy land from them. They respected Rav and would allow him, but would not allow Rabah bar bar Chanah.</p>
<p class="bas indent1"><span class="nm">(k)</span><span class="cl">Question:</span> Rav should have told him before buying it for himself!</p>
<p class="bas indent1"><span class="nm">(l)</span><span class="cl">Answer:</span> He was afraid that someone else would buy it in the interim.</p>
<p class="bas indent1"><span class="nm">(m)</span>Rav Gidal sought to buy a certain land. R. Aba bought it. Rav Gidal complained to R. Zeira, who told this to R. Yitzchak Nafcha.</p>
<p class="bas indent2"><span class="nm">1.</span><span class="cl">R. Yitzchak Nafcha (to R. Aba):</span> If a poor man seeks to get something, and someone else takes it, how do we view this?</p>
<p class="bas indent2"><span class="nm">2.</span><span class="cl">R. Aba:</span> The latter is a Rasha.</p>
<p class="bas indent2"><span class="nm">3.</span><span class="cl">R. Yitzchak Nafcha:</span> Why did you buy the land that Rav Gidal wanted?</p>
<p class="bas indent2"><span class="nm">4.</span><span class="cl">R. Aba:</span> I didn't know that he wanted it.</p>
<p class="bas indent2"><span class="nm">5.</span><span class="cl">R. Yitzchak Nafcha:</span> You should let him buy it from you.</p>
<p class="bas indent2"><span class="nm">6.</span><span class="cl">R. Aba:</span> It is the first land I bought. It is a bad omen to sell it. He may have it for a gift.</p>
<p class="bas indent2"><span class="nm">7.</span>Rav Gidal did not want a gift, for "one who hates gifts will live." R. Aba did not want to use it, for Rav Gidal had wanted to buy it. The land was left Hefker for Chachamim.</p>
<p class="bas subject"><span class="nm">2)</span>CAN WORDS OVERRIDE WORDS?</p>
<p class="bas indent1"><span class="nm">(a)</span><span class="cl">(Mishnah):</span> Similarly, if Reuven told Leah, be Mekudeshes to me after 30 days...</p>
<p class="bas indent1"><span class="nm">(b)</span><span class="cl">Question:</span> What is the law if no one was Mekadesh her in the interim?</p>
<p class="bas indent1"><span class="nm">(c)</span><span class="cl">Answer (Rav and Shmuel):</span> She is Mekudeshes, even if the Kidushin money has been consumed.</p>
<p class="bas indent1"><span class="nm">(d)</span>This is because there is no problem with the Kidushin money. It is not a loan, nor like a deposit;</p>
<p class="bas indent2"><span class="nm">1.</span>It is not a deposit. A deposit belongs to the giver, whereas this money belonged to her.</p>
<p class="bas indent2"><span class="nm">2.</span>It is not like (pardoning a) loan (that she owes to him). A loan was given to be spent (from the beginning), and when he pardons it to be Mekadesh her, he does not give her anything (new). Here, he gave the money for Kidushin!</p>
<p class="bas indent1"><span class="nm">(e)</span><span class="cl">Version #1 - Question:</span> If no one was Mekadesh her in the interim, can she cancel the Kidushin?</p>
<p class="bas indent1"><span class="nm">(f)</span><span class="cl">Answer #1 (R. Yochanan):</span> She can. Her latter words are Mevatel (revoke) her initial words.</p>
<p class="bas indent1"><span class="nm">(g)</span><span class="cl">Answer #2 (Reish Lakish):</span> She cannot. Words cannot be Mevatel words.</p>
<p class="bas indent1"><span class="nm">(h)</span><span class="cl">Question (R. Yochanan - Mishnah):</span> If Reuven appointed Shimon to be a Shali'ach to separate  Terumah, and cancelled the Shelichus before Shimon separated Terumah, the Terumah is invalid.</p>
<p class="bas indent2"><span class="nm">1.</span>This shows that words (the cancellation) can annul words (the appointment)!</p>
<p class="bas indent1"><span class="nm">(i)</span><span class="cl">Answer:</span> Giving Kidushin money to a woman is not mere words. It is like an action;</p>
<p class="bas indent2"><span class="nm">1.</span>Words cannot annul an action.</p>
<p class="bas indent1"><span class="nm">(j)</span><span class="cl">Question (Mishnah):</span> If Reuven made Shimon a Shali'ach to divorce Reuven's wife, and Reuven caught up with Shimon, or sent Levi to tell him that the Get is invalid, it is invalid.</p>
<p class="bas indent2"><span class="nm">1.</span>Giving a Get to a Shali'ach is like giving Kidushin money to a woman, and words can annul it!</p>
<p class="bas indent1"><span class="nm">(k)</span><span class="cl">Answer:</span> No. As long as the Get did not reach his wife, it is mere words. Words can be Mevatel words.</p>
<p class="bas indent1"><span class="nm">(l)</span><span class="cl">Question (Reish Lakish - Beraisa):</span> All Kelim can become able to receive Tum'ah through intent. They cease to be Mekabel Tum'ah only through an action done to change them.</p>
<p class="bas bbbline">59b----------------------------------------59b</p>
<p class="bas indent2"><span class="nm">1.</span>An action can be Mevatel actions and words. Intent cannot be Mevatel actions or intents.</p>
<p class="bas indent2"><span class="nm">2.</span>Granted, intent cannot annul actions. However, according to R. Yochanan, intent can be Mevatel intent!</p>
<p class="bas indent1"><span class="nm">(m)</span><span class="cl">Answer:</span> Regarding Tum'ah, intent is considered like action, like Rav Papa taught:</p>
<p class="bas indent2"><span class="nm">1.</span><span class="cl">Contradiction (Rav Papa):</span> It says "when (one) will (actively) put (water on food, it becomes Huchshar to receive Tum'ah)" but we read this like "when will be (passively) put"!</p>
<p class="bas indent2"><span class="nm">2.</span><span class="cl">Answer:</span> It suffices that 'water will be put' similar to "one will put", i.e. the owner of the food wants the water to be put.</p>
<p class="bas subject"><span class="nm">3)</span>ANOTHER VERSION</p>
<p class="bas indent1"><span class="nm">(a)</span><span class="cl">Version #2 - Rav Zevid (Mishnah):</span> Similarly, if Leah authorized a Shali'ach to be Mekadesh her to a man (and he accepted from David), and Leah accepted Kidushin from Levi, whichever Kidushin came first is valid.</p>
<p class="bas indent1"><span class="nm">(b)</span><span class="cl">Question:</span> If neither of them received Kidushin for her, can she cancel the Shelichus?</p>
<p class="bas indent1"><span class="nm">(c)</span><span class="cl">Answer #1 (R. Yochanan):</span> She can. Her latter words are Mevatel her initial words.</p>
<p class="bas indent1"><span class="nm">(d)</span><span class="cl">Answer #2 (Reish Lakish):</span> She cannot. Words cannot be Mevatel words.</p>
<p class="bas indent1"><span class="nm">(e)</span><span class="cl">Question (R. Yochanan - Mishnah):</span> If Reuven made Shimon a Shali'ach to separate Terumah, and cancelled the Shelichus before Shimon separated Terumah, the Terumah is invalid.</p>
<p class="bas indent1"><span class="nm">(f)</span><span class="cl">Answer (Rava):</span> The case is, Reuven himself separated Terumah before Shimon. All agree that an action can be Mevatel words.</p>
<p class="bas indent1"><span class="nm">(g)</span><span class="cl">Question (Reish Lakish - Beraisa):</span> All Kelim can become able to receive Tum'ah through intent. They cease to be Mekabel Tum'ah only through an action that changes them.</p>
<p class="bas indent2"><span class="nm">1.</span>An action can be Mevatel actions and words. Intent cannot be Mevatel action or intent.</p>
<p class="bas indent2"><span class="nm">2.</span>Granted, intent cannot be Mevatel an action. According to R. Yochanan, intent should be Mevatel intent!</p>
<p class="bas indent1"><span class="nm">(h)</span><span class="cl">Answer (R. Yochanan):</span> Regarding Tum'ah, intent is considered like action, like Rav Papa taught:</p>
<p class="bas indent2"><span class="nm">1.</span><span class="cl">Contradiction (Rav Papa):</span> It says "when (one) will (actively) put (water on food, it becomes Huchshar to receive Tum'ah)" but we read this like "when will be (passively) put"!</p>
<p class="bas indent2"><span class="nm">2.</span><span class="cl">Answer:</span> It suffices that 'water will be put' similar to "one will put", i.e. the owner of the food wants the water to be put.</p>
<p class="bas indent1"><span class="nm">(i)</span><span class="cl">Question (R. Yochanan - Mishnah):</span> If Reuven made Shimon a Shali'ach to divorce Reuven's wife, and  Reuven caught up with Shimon, or sent Levi to tell him that the Get is invalid, it is invalid.</p>
<p class="bas indent2"><span class="nm">1.</span>This refutes Reish Lakish.</p>
<p class="bas indent1"><span class="nm">(j)</span>The Halachah follows R. Yochanan, even according to Version #1.</p>
<p class="bas indent2"><span class="nm">1.</span>Even though one could say that giving Kidushin money to a woman is like an action, words can be Mevatel it.</p>
<p class="bas indent1"><span class="nm">(k)</span><span class="cl">Contradiction:</span> We said that the Halachah follows R. Yochanan. However, the Halachah follows the following teaching of Rav Nachman!</p>
<p class="bas indent2"><span class="nm">1.</span><span class="cl">Question:</span> If a man was Mevatel a Get that he gave to a Shali'ach, can he later use the Get?</p>
<p class="bas indent2"><span class="nm">2.</span><span class="cl">Answer #1 (Rav Nachman):</span> Yes.</p>
<p class="bas indent2"><span class="nm">3.</span><span class="cl">Answer #2 (Rav Sheshes):</span> No.</p>
<p class="bas indent3"><span class="nm">i.</span>The Halachah follows Rav Nachman (his latter words cannot be Mevatel the power of the Get to divorce)!</p>
<p class="bas indent1"><span class="nm">(l)</span><span class="cl">Answer:</span> The husband didn't intend to annul the Get itself, only the Shelichus.</p>
<p class="bas subject"><span class="nm">4)</span>THE KIDUSHIN IN THE MISHNAH</p>
<p class="bas indent1"><span class="nm">(a)</span><span class="cl">Version #1 (Mishnah):</span> She is Mekudeshes to the second man (Moshe).</p>
<p class="bas indent1"><span class="nm">(b)</span><span class="cl">(Rav):</span> She is forever Mekudeshes to Moshe.</p>
<p class="bas indent1"><span class="nm">(c)</span><span class="cl">(Shmuel):</span> She is Mekudeshes to him until the 30 days end. Then, Moshe's Kidushin vanishes, and the Kidushin of the first man (Reuven) is completed.</p>
<p class="bas indent1"><span class="nm">(d)</span><span class="cl">Question (Rav Chisda):</span> How does Moshe's Kidushin vanish?!</p>
<p class="bas indent1"><span class="nm">(e)</span><span class="cl">Answer (Rav Yosef):</span> You find this difficult because you learned that Rav and Shmuel argue about the middle case of the Mishnah (after 30 days). Rav Yehudah learns that they argue about the Seifa. He has no difficulty!</p>
<p class="bas indent1"><span class="nm">(f)</span><span class="cl">Version #2 (Mishnah):</span> If he said 'from now and after 30 days', she is Mekudeshes and not Mekudeshes.</p>
<p class="bas indent1"><span class="nm">(g)</span><span class="cl">(Rav):</span> She is forever Mekudeshes and not Mekudeshes.</p>
<p class="bas indent1"><span class="nm">(h)</span><span class="cl">(Shmuel):</span> She is Mekudeshes and not Mekudeshes until the 30 days end. Then, Moshe's Kidushin vanishes, and Reuven's Kidushin is completed.</p>
<p class="bas indent2"><span class="nm">1.</span>Rav is unsure whether 'after 30 days' is a Tenai (a stipulation, you are Mekudeshes to me from now, on condition that I do not retract within 30 days), or a retraction (of 'from now');</p>
<p class="bas indent2"><span class="nm">2.</span>Shmuel is sure that 'after 30 days' is a Tenai. Since Reuven did not retract within the 30 days, she is Mekudeshes to him.</p>
<p class="bas indent1"><span class="nm">(i)</span>Rav and Shmuel argue like the following Tana'im.</p>
<p class="bas indent2"><span class="nm">1.</span><span class="cl">(Beraisa):</span> (If one said 'you are divorced with this Get) from now and after my death', she is divorced and not divorced;</p>
<p class="bas indent2"><span class="nm">2.</span>Rebbi says, such a Get is valid.</p>
<p class="bas indent1"><span class="nm">(j)</span><span class="cl">Question:</span> Rav should have said that the Halachah follows Chachamim, and Shmuel should have said that the Halachah follows Rebbi (so we would know that not everyone agrees to the law)!</p>
<p class="bas indent1"><span class="nm">(k)</span><span class="cl">Answer:</span> It would not suffice to say this;</p>
<p class="bas indent2"><span class="nm">1.</span>Had Rav said that the Halachah follows Chachamim, one might have thought that this is only regarding divorce, since he comes to separate from her (perhaps he wants to delay it, and retracted from 'from now');</p>
<p class="bas indent3"><span class="nm">i.</span>Regarding Kidushin, he comes close to her (and wants it to take effect immediately, so) perhaps 'after 30 days' is only a Tenai!</p>
<p class="bas indent2"><span class="nm">2.</span>Had Shmuel said that the Halachah follows Rebbi, one might have thought that this is only regarding divorce, since a Get cannot work after death (surely he wants it to work from now), but regarding Kidushin, perhaps he retracts and wants it to take effect after 30 days!</p>
