<div class="indent1"><span class="nm">(a)</span><p><span class="cl">Version #1 - Question (Reish Lakish):</span> "If there will be no Ason (death), he will pay".</p></div>
<div class="indent2"><span class="nm">1.</span><p><span class="cl">Suggestion:</span> We explain <i>Ason</i> literally. (This implies that if someone dies he is exempt, even if he was not warned!)</p></div>
<div class="indent1"><span class="nm">(b)</span><p><span class="cl">Answer:</span> No, the verse means 'if there is no sentence to die (e.g. he was Shogeg, or was not warned), he will pay'.</p></div>
<div class="indent1"><span class="nm">(c)</span><p><span class="cl">Version #2 - Question (R. Yochanan):</span> "If there will be no Ason, he will pay".</p></div>
<div class="indent2"><span class="nm">1.</span><p><span class="cl">Suggestion:</span> <i>Ason</i> means a sentence to die (if there is no sentence, he pays)!</p></div>
<div class="indent1"><span class="nm">(d)</span><p><span class="cl">Answer:</span> No, <i>Ason</i> literally means death.</p></div>
<div class="indent1"><span class="nm">(e)</span><p><span class="cl">Question:</span> Surely, all agree that one who transgressed a capital sin b'Shogeg need not pay!</p></div>
<div class="indent2"><span class="nm">1.</span><p><span class="cl">(Tana d'Vei Chizkiyah):</span> "One who strikes an animal... and one who strikes (kills) a man" equates these. Just like one who hits an animal pays, whether he was Shogeg or Meizid, whether or not he was aiming for this animal, and whether he hit with an upward or downward motion, also one who strikes a man is exempt (from paying) in every case.</p></div>
<div class="indent1"><span class="nm">(f)</span><p><span class="cl">Correction (Ravin):</span> Rather, if one transgressed a capital sin b'Shogeg, all agree that he does not pay;</p></div>
<div class="indent1"><span class="nm">(g)</span><p>They argue about one who transgressed b'Shogeg a sin punishable by lashes and money;</p></div>
<div class="indent2"><span class="nm">1.</span><p>R. Yochanan says that he pays. Only capital sins are equated (e:1) to striking an animal (to teach that he does not pay in any case). Chayavei Makos (sins punishable by lashes) were not equated.</p></div>
<div class="indent2"><span class="nm">2.</span><p>Reish Lakish exempts from paying. The Torah explicitly equates Chayavei Makos to capital sins.</p></div>
<div class="subject"><span class="nm">2)</span><p>CHAYAVEI MAKOS ARE LIKE CAPITAL SINS</p></div>
<div class="indent1"><span class="nm">(a)</span><p><span class="cl">Question:</span> Where did the Torah equate them?</p></div>
<div class="indent1"><span class="nm">(b)</span><p><span class="cl">Answer #1 (Abaye):</span> We learn from a Gezeirah Shavah "Rasha-Rasha".</p></div>
<div class="indent1"><span class="nm">(c)</span><p><span class="cl">Answer #2 (Rava):</span> We learn from a Gezeirah Shavah "Makeh-Makeh".</p></div>
<div class="indent1"><span class="nm">(d)</span><p><span class="cl">Question (Rav Papa):</span> From which occurrences of these words do you learn?</p></div>
<div class="indent2"><span class="nm">1.</span><p>You cannot learn from "<i>Makeh</i> (one who strikes) an animal will pay for it" and "<i>Makeh</i> (one who strikes) a man will die", for the latter verse discusses killing a man!</p></div>
<div class="indent2"><span class="nm">2.</span><p>You cannot learn from "<i>Makeh</i> Nefesh (one who mortally strikes) an animal will pay for it" and "If a man will wound a man (...so will be done to him)", for the latter verse does not say "Makeh"!</p></div>
<div class="indent1"><span class="nm">(e)</span><p><span class="cl">Answer (Rava):</span> I learn from the latter verses. Both of them discuss hitting.</p></div>
<div class="indent1"><span class="nm">(f)</span><p><span class="cl">Question:</span> You cannot learn about Chayavei Makos from hitting a man. One is not lashed for this, rather, he pays money!</p></div>
<div class="indent1"><span class="nm">(g)</span><p><span class="cl">Answer:</span> We do not need "so will be done to him" to teach about a blow worth a Perutah, so it teaches about a blow worth less than a Perutah (which is punishable by lashes).</p></div>
<div class="bbbline">35b----------------------------------------35b</p></div>
<div class="indent1"><span class="nm">(h)</span><p><span class="cl">Question:</span> If so, surely he does not pay!</p></div>
<div class="indent1"><span class="nm">(i)</span><p><span class="cl">Answer:</span> While hitting him, he tore his silk. (The Hekesh exempts him from paying for the silk.)</p></div>
<div class="indent1"><span class="nm">(j)</span><p><span class="cl">Question (Rav Chiya):</span> Tana d'Vei Chizkiyah equated striking an animal and a man. How do we know that he hit it on a weekday and always pays? Perhaps he hit it on Shabbos, and we distinguish (between Shogeg and Meizid)!</p></div>
<div class="indent1"><span class="nm">(k)</span><p><span class="cl">Answer (Rava) Question:</span> What is the case of "One who strikes an animal will pay for it, and one who strikes a man will die"?</p></div>
<div class="indent2"><span class="nm">1.</span><p>If there was no warning, we would not kill one who struck a man!</p></div>
<div class="indent2"><span class="nm">2.</span><p><span class="cl">Answer:</span> We must say he was warned.</p></div>
<div class="indent2"><span class="nm">3.</span><p>If he struck the animal on Shabbos (with warning), he would not pay! Rather, we must say that he hit it on a weekday.</p></div>

<div class="indent1"><span class="nm">(a)</span><p><span class="cl">Question (Rav Papa):</span> Rabah obligates (according to R. Meir) even one who is executed to pay a fine. Like whom does he establish our Mishnah?</p></div>
<div class="indent2"><span class="nm">1.</span><p>If it is R. Meir, one should pay even for (raping or seducing) his own daughter!</p></div>
<div class="indent2"><span class="nm">2.</span><p>If it is like R. Nechunya ben Hakanah (who exempts Chayavei Krisos from paying), he should not pay for his sister!</p></div>
<div class="indent2"><span class="nm">3.</span><p>If it is R. Yitzchak (who exempts Chayavei Krisos from lashes), he should be lashed for a Mamzeres but not pay for her.</p></div>
<div class="indent2"><span class="nm">4.</span><p>If Rabah holds like R. Yochanan, he can explain like R. Yochanan (there was no warning for lashes). But if he holds like Reish Lakish, how can he explain the Mishnah?</p></div>

<div class="indent1"><span class="nm">(c)</span><p><span class="cl">Question (Rav Masna):</span> (A Tana obligates one who burned on Yom Kipur to pay.) According to Reish Lakish, who equates Chayavei Makos to capital sins, who is this Tana, who argues with R. Nechunya ben Hakanah?</p></div>
<div class="indent1"><span class="nm">(d)</span><p><span class="cl">Answer (Abaye):</span> It is R. Meir (who says that one is lashed and pays) or R. Yitzchak.</p></div>
