<p class="bas subject"><span class="nm">1)</span>ARE KOHANIM SHLUCHIM OF YISRAEL? (cont.)</p>
<p class="bas indent1"><span class="nm">(a)</span><span class="cl">Question (Rav Simi bar Aba - Beraisa):</span> A Kohen may offer (for David, who is Mudar Hana'ah from him) the blood of David's Chatas or Asham. (This shows that he is Hash-m's Shali'ach!)</p>
<p class="bas indent1"><span class="nm">(b)</span><span class="cl">Answer:</span> This refers to the Chatas and Asham of a Metzora (Mechusar Kipurim);</p>
<p class="bas indent2"><span class="nm">1.</span>"Zos Toras ha'Metzora" - whether he is an adult or a minor. (Since we bring for children, this shows that his consent is not needed.)</p>
<p class="bas indent1"><span class="nm">(c)</span><span class="cl">(Mishnah):</span> If a Kohen was Mefagel (offered a Korban with improper intent, e.g. to eat it after the allowed time) intentionally, he must compensate the owner of the Korban.</p>
<p class="bas indent1"><span class="nm">(d)</span><span class="cl">Inference:</span> If he did so unintentionally, he need not pay, but the Korban is Pigul (disqualified).</p>
<p class="bas indent1"><span class="nm">(e)</span>We understand according to the opinion that a Kohen is a Shali'ach of Hash-m. (Hash-m made him a Shali'ach in every case.)</p>
<p class="bas indent1"><span class="nm">(f)</span><span class="cl">Question:</span> According to the opinion that he is a Shali'ach of Yisrael, why is it Pigul?</p>
<p class="bas indent2"><span class="nm">1.</span>(Regarding an Isur that depends on intent, a person cannot forbid what is not his. Here, the Kohen is not the owner's Shali'ach, for) he made him a Shali'ach to help him, not to hurt him!</p>
<p class="bas indent1"><span class="nm">(g)</span><span class="cl">Answer:</span> Even though he is a Shali'ach of Yisrael, Pigul is an exception. It says "(ha'Makriv Oso) Lo Yechashev" - in any case (even if the one who offered it had Pasul intent).</p>
<p class="bas subject"><span class="nm">2)</span>THE CONSENT REQUIRED FOR <i>KORBANOS</i></p>
<p class="bas indent1"><span class="nm">(a)</span><span class="cl">(R. Yochanan):</span> Every Korban requires the consent of the one for whom it is brought, except Mechusar Kipurim, for a man may bring these for his minor children.</p>
<p class="bas indent1"><span class="nm">(b)</span><span class="cl">Question:</span> If so, if Levi ate Chelev, David should be able to bring a Chatas for him, just like a man brings this for his insane wife, according to R. Yehudah!</p>
<p class="bas indent2"><span class="nm">1.</span>But R. Elazar said that if David separated a Chatas Chelev for Levi, this has no effect!</p>
<p class="bas indent1"><span class="nm">(c)</span><span class="cl">Answer:</span> (One does not bring Chatas Chelev for an insane wife. R. Yehudah meant that he brings Chatas Yoledes for her;)</p>
<p class="bas indent2"><span class="nm">1.</span><span class="cl">Question:</span> In which case would one bring Chatas Chelev for an insane wife?</p>
<p class="bas indent3"><span class="nm">i.</span>If she was insane when she ate, no Korban is brought for this!</p>
<p class="bas indent2"><span class="nm">2.</span><span class="cl">Answer:</span> She ate while sane, and later became insane.</p>
<p class="bas indent2"><span class="nm">3.</span><span class="cl">Rejection:</span> R. Yochanan taught that if a (sane) man ate Chelev, separated his Chatas, became insane, and returned to sanity, the animal is disqualified. Since it was unfitting to bring while he was insane, it is forever unfitting.</p>
<p class="bas indent1"><span class="nm">(d)</span><span class="cl">Question:</span> According to R. Yochanan, David should be able to bring a Korban Pesach for Levi, for one can bring it for his minor children!</p>
<p class="bas indent2"><span class="nm">1.</span>But R. Elazar taught that if David separated a Korban Pesach for Levi, this has no effect!</p>
<p class="bas indent1"><span class="nm">(e)</span><span class="cl">Answer (R. Zeira):</span> "A lamb for the household" is not mid'Oraisa. (Minors need not own a share.)</p>
<p class="bas indent1"><span class="nm">(f)</span><span class="cl">Question:</span> How does he know this?</p>
<p class="bas indent1"><span class="nm">(g)</span><span class="cl">Answer (Mishnah):</span> If a man told his children 'I will slaughter the Pesach on behalf of whoever is first to ascend to Yerushalayim', once one of them enters, he acquires his portion, and acquires on behalf of his siblings.</p>
<p class="bas indent2"><span class="nm">1.</span>If minors must be counted on the Korban mid'Oraisa, the acquisition could not work after Shechitah!</p>
<p class="bas indent1"><span class="nm">(h)</span><span class="cl">Question:</span> If so, why did he tell his children that the acquisition will be through the first to ascend?</p>
<p class="bas indent1"><span class="nm">(i)</span><span class="cl">Answer:</span> This was to train them to zealously perform Mitzvos.</p>
<p class="bas indent2"><span class="nm">1.</span><span class="cl">(Beraisa):</span> It happened that the daughters ascended before the boys. They were zealous, and the boys were lowly. (The Beraisa does not say that the girls acquired on behalf of the boys.)</p>
<p class="bas subject"><span class="nm">3)</span>SEPARATION OF <i>TERUMAH</i></p>
<p class="bas indent1"><span class="nm">(a)</span><span class="cl">(Mishnah):</span> He may separate Terumah for him...</p>
<p class="bas bbbline">36b----------------------------------------36b</p>
<p class="bas indent1"><span class="nm">(b)</span><span class="cl">Question:</span> Does one need Shimon's consent to separate Terumah for him?</p>
<p class="bas indent2"><span class="nm">1.</span>Since this is advantageous for Shimon, his consent is not needed;</p>
<p class="bas indent2"><span class="nm">2.</span>Or, perhaps he prefers to do the Mitzvah himself!</p>
<p class="bas indent1"><span class="nm">(c)</span><span class="cl">Answer (Mishnah):</span> He may separate Terumah and Ma'aser for him with his Da'as (will).</p>
<p class="bas indent2"><span class="nm">1.</span><span class="cl">Question:</span> What is the case?</p>
<p class="bas indent2"><span class="nm">2.</span><span class="cl">Answer #1:</span> Reuven separates part of Simchah's produce to be Terumah to exempt the rest of Simchah's produce.</p>
<p class="bas indent2"><span class="nm">3.</span><span class="cl">Objection:</span> Whose Da'as does he need?</p>
<p class="bas indent3"><span class="nm">i.</span>If Reuven acts on his own Da'as, the separation is invalid, for he was not made a Shali'ach!</p>
<p class="bas indent3"><span class="nm">ii.</span>If he has Simchah's Da'as, Reuven fulfills his mission. This gives Simchah pleasure!</p>
<p class="bas indent2"><span class="nm">4.</span><span class="cl">Answer #2:</span> Rather, we must say that Reuven separates his own produce to be Terumah to exempt Simchah's produce.</p>
<p class="bas indent2"><span class="nm">5.</span><span class="cl">Question:</span> Whose Da'as does he have?</p>
<p class="bas indent3"><span class="nm">i.</span>If he has Simchah's Da'as, Reuven fulfills his mission. This gives Simchah pleasure!</p>
<p class="bas indent2"><span class="nm">6.</span><span class="cl">Answer:</span> Rather, Reuven acts on his own Da'as. This shows that Simchah's consent is not needed.</p>
<p class="bas indent1"><span class="nm">(d)</span><span class="cl">Rejection:</span> Really, he took the Terumah from Simchah's produce;</p>
<p class="bas indent2"><span class="nm">1.</span>The case is like Rava said (elsewhere). Simchah said 'whoever wants to separate Terumah may do so'.</p>
<p class="bas indent1"><span class="nm">(e)</span><span class="cl">Question (R. Yirmiyah):</span> If Reuven separates his produce to be Terumah to exempt Simchah's, who has Tovas Hana'ah (decides which Kohen receives it)?</p>
<p class="bas indent2"><span class="nm">1.</span>Reuven should have it, for without his produce, Simchah's produce would be untithed!</p>
<p class="bas indent2"><span class="nm">2.</span>Or, Simchah should have it, for without his produce, Reuven's produce would not become Terumah!</p>
<p class="bas indent1"><span class="nm">(f)</span><span class="cl">Answer #1 (R. Zeira):</span> "All the produce of your seed you will give" (the giving is dependent on the owner of the produce being exempted).</p>
<p class="bas indent1"><span class="nm">(g)</span><span class="cl">Question (Mishnah):</span> He may separate Terumah and Ma'aser for him with his consent...</p>
<p class="bas indent2"><span class="nm">1.</span>If Simchah has Tovas Hana'ah, Reuven benefits Simchah (since the Terumah was from Reuven's produce).</p>
<p class="bas indent2"><span class="nm">2.</span>Rather, we must say that Reuven has Tovas Hana'ah!</p>
<p class="bas indent1"><span class="nm">(h)</span><span class="cl">Answer:</span> Really, the Terumah was from Simchah's produce. The case is, Simchah said 'Whoever wants to separate Terumah may do so.'</p>
<p class="bas indent1"><span class="nm">(i)</span><span class="cl">Answer #2 (R. Avahu):</span> The one who made an object Hekdesh adds the fifth when he redeems it. The one who gets atonement from a Korban can make Temurah from it. If Reuven makes his produce Terumah to exempt Simchah's produce, Reuven has Tovas Hana'ah.</p>
<p class="bas subject"><span class="nm">4)</span>IS LEARNING CONSIDERED BENEFIT?</p>
<p class="bas indent1"><span class="nm">(a)</span><span class="cl">(Mishnah):</span> Reuven may teach Simchah Medrash, laws and Agadeta, but not written Torah.</p>
<p class="bas indent1"><span class="nm">(b)</span><span class="cl">Question:</span> Surely, he may not teach him written Torah because he benefits him. The same should apply to Medrash!</p>
<p class="bas indent1"><span class="nm">(c)</span><span class="cl">Answer (Shmuel):</span> The Mishnah discusses a place where people take money for teaching written Torah, but not for Medrash.</p>
<p class="bas indent1"><span class="nm">(d)</span><span class="cl">Question:</span> Why does the Tana assume that this is the case (without specifying)?</p>
<p class="bas normal"></p>
