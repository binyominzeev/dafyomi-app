<p class="bas subject"><span class="nm">1)</span>OXEN THAT DO NOT PAY</p>
<p class="bas indent1"><span class="nm">(a)</span><span class="cl">(Mishnah):</span> If a healthy person's ox gored the ox of a Cheresh (deaf-mute), lunatic or child, he is liable;</p>
<p class="bas indent2"><span class="nm">1.</span>If the ox of a Cheresh, lunatic or child gored a healthy person's ox, he is exempt.</p>
<p class="bas indent1"><span class="nm">(b)</span>If the ox of a Cheresh, lunatic or child gores, Beis Din appoints an Apotropos (overseer). Witnesses testify in front of the Apotropos.</p>
<p class="bas indent1"><span class="nm">(c)</span>R. Meir says, when the Cheresh or lunatic becomes healthy, or the child grows up, the ox reverts to being Tam;</p>
<p class="bas indent1"><span class="nm">(d)</span>R. Yosi says, it keeps its status.</p>
<p class="bas indent1"><span class="nm">(e)</span>An Itztadin ox (one that is trained to gore in stadiums) is not killed - "when (an ox) will gore (...it will be stoned)", not when it is incited to gore.</p>
<p class="bas indent1"><span class="nm">(f)</span><span class="cl">(Gemara) Question:</span> The Mishnah says that if the ox of a Cheresh, lunatic or child gored a healthy person's ox, he is exempt. I.e., we don't appoint an Apotropos to collect from a Tam ox;</p>
<p class="bas indent2"><span class="nm">1.</span><span class="cl">Contradiction (Seifa):</span> If the ox of a Cheresh, lunatic or child gores, Beis Din appoints an Apotropos, and witnesses testify in front of the Apotropos (to collect from it)!</p>
<p class="bas indent1"><span class="nm">(g)</span><span class="cl">Answer (Rava):</span> If the ox of a Cheresh, lunatic or child is established to gore, Beis Din appoints an Apotropos, and witnesses testify in front of the Apotropos to make the ox Mu'ad. Future gorings are paid for from the Aliyah (i.e., not from the ox itself).</p>
<p class="bas indent1"><span class="nm">(h)</span><span class="cl">Question:</span> After it is Mu'ad, who pays?</p>
<p class="bas indent1"><span class="nm">(i)</span><span class="cl">Answer #1 (R. Yochanan):</span> The child pays.</p>
<p class="bas indent1"><span class="nm">(j)</span><span class="cl">Answer #2 (R. Yosi bar Chanina):</span> The Apotropos pays.</p>
<p class="bas indent1"><span class="nm">(k)</span><span class="cl">Question:</span> Did R. Yochanan really say that the child pays?!</p>
<p class="bas indent2"><span class="nm">1.</span><span class="cl">(Rav Yehudah):</span> Beis Din collects from orphans' property only to pay off a loan (from a Nochri) on interest.</p>
<p class="bas indent2"><span class="nm">2.</span><span class="cl">(R. Yochanan):</span> They collect only for a loan on interest, or to pay a Kesuvah (this exempts the orphans from feeding the widow).</p>
<p class="bas indent1"><span class="nm">(l)</span><span class="cl">Answer #1:</span> We must switch the opinions of R. Yochanan and R. Yosi bar Chanina.</p>
<p class="bas indent1"><span class="nm">(m)</span><span class="cl">Objection (Rava):</span> If so, R. Yosi bar Chanina obligates the child for future gorings. This is wrong!</p>
<p class="bas indent2"><span class="nm">1.</span>R. Yosi bar Chanina was a judge. He descended to the depth of judgment. Surely he did not say this!</p>
<p class="bas indent1"><span class="nm">(n)</span><span class="cl">Answer #2 (Rava):</span> Do not switch the opinions. A damager is an exception to the normal rule;</p>
<p class="bas indent2"><span class="nm">1.</span>R. Yochanan says we collect from the child. If we would collect from the Apotropos, no one would agree to be an Apotropos!</p>
<p class="bas bbbline">39b----------------------------------------39b</p>
<p class="bas indent2"><span class="nm">2.</span>R. Yosi bar Chanina says that we collect from the Apotropos. When the child grows up, the Apotropos collects from him.</p>
<p class="bas subject"><span class="nm">2)</span>COLLECTING FROM PEOPLE WHO ARE NOT HERE</p>
<p class="bas indent1"><span class="nm">(a)</span>Tana'im argue about whether or not we appoint an Apotropos to collect from a Tam.</p>
<p class="bas indent2"><span class="nm">1.</span><span class="cl">(Beraisa - Sumchus):</span> If Reuven became deaf or insane, or went overseas, his ox is Tam until witnesses testify (three times) in front of him (when he is well);</p>
<p class="bas indent2"><span class="nm">2.</span>Chachamim say, we appoint an Apotropos, and witnesses testify in front of the Apotropos;</p>
<p class="bas indent2"><span class="nm">3.</span>Sumchus says, if Reuven recovered, grew up or returned from overseas, his ox reverts to be Tam until witnesses testify in front of him;</p>
<p class="bas indent2"><span class="nm">4.</span>R. Yosi says, the ox keeps its status.</p>
<p class="bas indent1"><span class="nm">(b)</span><span class="cl">Question:</span> Sumchus said 'his ox is Tam (until witnesses testify). What does this mean?</p>
<p class="bas indent2"><span class="nm">1.</span><span class="cl">Suggestion:</span> Witnesses do not testify to make it Mu'ad (in his absence).</p>
<p class="bas indent2"><span class="nm">2.</span><span class="cl">Rejection:</span> The Reisha says 'his ox reverts to be Tam.' This shows that it became Mu'ad!</p>
<p class="bas indent1"><span class="nm">(c)</span><span class="cl">Answer:</span> Rather, 'his ox is Tam' - it is in its Temimus (entirety). I.e. we do not appoint an Apotropos to collect from a Tam ox in Reuven's absence (but we accept testimony to make it Mu'ad);</p>
<p class="bas indent2"><span class="nm">1.</span>Chachamim argue, and say that we appoint an Apotropos to collect from a Tam!</p>
<p class="bas indent1"><span class="nm">(d)</span><span class="cl">Question:</span> What do they argue about in the Seifa?</p>
<p class="bas indent1"><span class="nm">(e)</span><span class="cl">Answer:</span> They argue about whether a change in Reshus (jurisdiction) changes status of the ox.</p>
<p class="bas indent2"><span class="nm">1.</span>Sumchus says that a change in Reshus changes its status. R. Yosi says that it does not.</p>
<p class="bas subject"><span class="nm">3)</span>R. YAKOV'S OPINION</p>
<p class="bas indent1"><span class="nm">(a)</span><span class="cl">(Beraisa #1):</span> The ox of a Cheresh, lunatic or child gored;, R. Yakov pays half-damage.</p>
<p class="bas indent1"><span class="nm">(b)</span><span class="cl">Objection:</span> Why should R. Yakov pay?!</p>
<p class="bas indent1"><span class="nm">(c)</span><span class="cl">Correction:</span> Rather, R. Yakov says that it pays half- damage.</p>
<p class="bas indent1"><span class="nm">(d)</span><span class="cl">Question:</span> What is the case (in which R. Yakov needed to teach that it pays half-damage)?</p>
<p class="bas indent2"><span class="nm">1.</span>If it is Tam, this is obvious. Every Tam pays half-damage!</p>
<p class="bas indent2"><span class="nm">2.</span><span class="cl">Suggestion:</span> It is Mu'ad.</p>
<p class="bas indent2"><span class="nm">3.</span><span class="cl">Rejection:</span> If it was guarded well, it is exempt. If it was not guarded, it pays full damage!</p>
<p class="bas indent1"><span class="nm">(e)</span><span class="cl">Answer (Rava):</span> Really, it is Mu'ad. It was guarded, but not well guarded;</p>
<p class="bas indent2"><span class="nm">1.</span>R. Yakov holds like R. Yehudah, who says that when an animal becomes Mu'ad, it retains the obligation to pay for half-damage like a Tam;</p>
<p class="bas indent2"><span class="nm">2.</span>He holds like R. Yehudah, that a Mu'ad is exempt if one guarded it minimally (so he is exempt from the additional half that a Mu'ad pays);</p>
<p class="bas indent2"><span class="nm">3.</span>He holds like Chachamim, that we appoint an Apotropos to collect from a Tam (so he pays this half).</p>
<p class="bas indent1"><span class="nm">(f)</span><span class="cl">Objection (Abaye):</span> R. Yakov does not hold like R. Yehudah!</p>
<p class="bas indent2"><span class="nm">1.</span><span class="cl">(Beraisa #2 - R. Yehudah):</span> If the ox of a Cheresh, lunatic or child gored, it is liable;</p>
<p class="bas indent2"><span class="nm">2.</span>R. Yakov says, it pays half-damage.</p>
<p class="bas indent1"><span class="nm">(g)</span><span class="cl">Answer (Rabah bar Ula):</span> They don't argue. R. Yakov explains R. Yehudah.</p>
<p class="bas indent1"><span class="nm">(h)</span><span class="cl">Question:</span> According to Abaye, what do they argue about?</p>
<p class="bas indent1"><span class="nm">(i)</span><span class="cl">Answer #1:</span> They argue about a Mu'ad that was not guarded at all. R. Yakov holds like R. Yehudah regarding one law, but not regarding another.</p>
<p class="bas indent2"><span class="nm">1.</span>He agrees that when an animal becomes Mu'ad, it retains liability to pay half-damage like a Tam;</p>
<p class="bas indent2"><span class="nm">2.</span>R. Yehudah holds that we appoint an Apotropos to collect from a Tam. R. Yakov holds that he is appointed only to collect the extra half-damage of Mu'ad.</p>
