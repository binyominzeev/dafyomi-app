<p class="bas subject"><span class="nm">1)</span>UPROOTING SOMETHING FROM WHERE IT GROWS ON SHABBOS</p>
<p class="bas indent1"><span class="nm">(a)</span><span class="cl">(Mar bar ha'Meduri):</span> If one stuck his hand into an animal's womb and moved (thereby aborting) the fetus, he is liable.</p>
<p class="bas indent1"><span class="nm">(b)</span><span class="cl">Question:</span> What is the reason?</p>
<p class="bas indent1"><span class="nm">(c)</span><span class="cl">Answer (Rava):</span> Rav Sheshes taught that if one uproots hops from prickly shrubs he is liable for uprooting something from where it grows - the same applies here.</p>
<p class="bas indent1"><span class="nm">(d)</span><span class="cl">(Abaye):</span> If one uproots mushrooms growing on the handle of a bucket, he is liable for uprooting something from where it grows.</p>
<p class="bas indent1"><span class="nm">(e)</span><span class="cl">Question (against Rav Sheshes and Abaye - R. Oshaya - Mishnah):</span> If one detaches something that was growing in a flowerpot with a hole, he is liable; if the flowerpot does not have a hole, he is exempt (because its contents do not grow from the ground - the same applies to mushrooms)!</p>
<p class="bas indent1"><span class="nm">(f)</span><span class="cl">Answer:</span> It is abnormal to grow something in a flowerpot without a hole - it is normal for mushrooms to grow on a bucket or hops on prickly shrubs.</p>
<p class="bas indent1"><span class="nm">(g)</span><span class="cl">(Mishnah):</span> If one traps animals or birds...</p>
<p class="bas indent1"><span class="nm">(h)</span><span class="cl">(Rav Huna):</span> One may write Tefilin on skin of a Tahor bird.</p>
<p class="bas indent1"><span class="nm">(i)</span><span class="cl">Question (Rav Yosef):</span> Does he teach that birds have skin? We already learn this from our Mishnah - '...If he wounds them (animals or birds) he is liable'!</p>
<p class="bas indent1"><span class="nm">(j)</span><span class="cl">Answer (Abaye):</span> One might have thought that their skin is Pasul for Tefilin because it is full of holes (where feathers were removed) - Rav Huna teaches, this is not so, like Chachamim of Eretz Yisrael:</p>
<p class="bas indent2"><span class="nm">1.</span><span class="cl">(Chachamim of Eretz Yisrael):</span> We are not concerned for any hole that the ink passes over (i.e. no hole will be seen in the letter).</p>
<p class="bas indent1"><span class="nm">(k)</span><span class="cl">Version #1 - Question (R. Zeira - Beraisa):</span> "Vi'Chnafav" - this is Machshir the skin (Olas ha'Of is burned on the Mizbe'ach with its skin).</p>
<p class="bas indent2"><span class="nm">1.</span>If the skin is different than the flesh, it should be removed [like skin of Olas Behemah]!</p>
<p class="bas indent1"><span class="nm">(l)</span><span class="cl">Answer (Abaye):</span> It is skin, the Torah permitted it to the Mizbe'ach.</p>
<p class="bas indent1"><span class="nm">(m)</span><span class="cl">Version #2 - Support (R. Zeira - Beraisa):</span> "Vi'Chnafav" - this is Machshir the skin.</p>
<p class="bas indent2"><span class="nm">1.</span>If the skin is different than the flesh, we understand why we need a verse to permit it - but if it is like the flesh, why is a verse needed?</p>
<p class="bas indent1"><span class="nm">(n)</span><span class="cl">Answer (Abaye):</span> Perhaps it is like flesh, but because it is full of holes, one might have thought that it is repulsive [and Pasul for Hakravah] - the verse teaches, this is not so.</p>
<p class="bas indent1"><span class="nm">(o)</span><span class="cl">Question (Mar brei d'Ravina):</span> May one write Tefilin on skin of a Tahor fish?</p>
<p class="bas indent1"><span class="nm">(p)</span><span class="cl">Answer (Rav Nachman bar Yitzchak):</span> If Eliyahu will come and say.</p>
<p class="bas indent1"><span class="nm">(q)</span><span class="cl">Question:</span> What does this mean? (After Moshe, prophecy cannot determine Halachah!)</p>
<p class="bas indent2"><span class="nm">1.</span><span class="cl">Suggestion:</span> He will say whether or not it has skin.</p>
<p class="bas indent2"><span class="nm">2.</span><span class="cl">Rejection #1:</span> We see that it has skin!</p>
<p class="bas indent2"><span class="nm">3.</span><span class="cl">Rejection #2 (Mishnah):</span> [A Kli made of] bones or skin of a fish shield from Tum'ah in Ohel ha'Mes [since it is not Mekabel Tum'ah. The Mishnah does not show that Halachah distinguishes the skin from the flesh - also flesh of fish is Tahor! Rather, we understand that it [only] discusses Kelim made of the skin because the skin can be made into Kelim, unlike the flesh.]</p>
<p class="bas indent1"><span class="nm">(r)</span><span class="cl">Answer:</span> (Initially, it is disgusting.) If Eliyahu will say that [after it is tanned] it is no longer considered disgusting, it is Kosher. If not, it is Pasul. [Maharatz Chayos - Chachamim know the Halachah, that one may not write on something disgusting. Eliyahu can tell us the nature of fish skin.]</p>
<p class="bas subject"><span class="nm">2)</span><i>TEFILIN</i> MUST BE FROM A SPECIES THAT IS <i>TAHOR</i></p>
<p class="bas indent1"><span class="nm">(a)</span>Shmuel and Karna were on the bank of the Malka river; there were big waves, and the water was cloudy.</p>
<p class="bas indent1"><span class="nm">(b)</span><span class="cl">Shmuel:</span> A great Chacham is coming from Eretz Yisrael; he has stomach problems, the water is rising in front of him (Rashi - to cover up his pain; Tosfos - Shmuel had heard that a Chacham was coming, he knew that he would be sick on account of drinking the cloudy water - he was a brilliant doctor);</p>
<p class="bas indent2"><span class="nm">1.</span>Go check if he really is a Chacham!</p>
<p class="bas indent1"><span class="nm">(c)</span><span class="cl">Question (Karna, of Rav):</span> What is the source that one may write Tefilin only on skin of a Tahor animal?</p>
<p class="bas indent1"><span class="nm">(d)</span><span class="cl">Answer (Rav):</span> "Lema'an Tihyeh Toras Hash-m b'Ficha" - it must be from something permitted to your mouth.</p>
<p class="bas indent1"><span class="nm">(e)</span><span class="cl">Question (Karna):</span> What is the source that blood is red [but other colors do not make a woman Nidah]?</p>
<p class="bas indent1"><span class="nm">(f)</span><span class="cl">Answer (Rav):</span> "Va'Yir'u Mo'av...ha'Mayim Adumim ka'Dam" - this teaches that blood is red.</p>
<p class="bas indent1"><span class="nm">(g)</span><span class="cl">Question (Karna):</span> How do we know where to circumcise?</p>
<p class="bas indent1"><span class="nm">(h)</span><span class="cl">Answer (Rav):</span> It says 'Orlah', like it says regarding fruits of the first three years - just like there it relates to procreation, also regarding Milah.</p>
<p class="bas indent1"><span class="nm">(i)</span><span class="cl">Questions (Karna):</span> Perhaps it refers to the heart, or to the ear - it says "U'Maltem Es Orlas Levavchem", and "Hine Arelah Oznam"!</p>
<p class="bas indent1"><span class="nm">(j)</span><span class="cl">Answer (Rav):</span> It is better to learn Orlah without an accompanying name from another such Orlah (as opposed to Orlah of the heart or ear).</p>
<p class="bas indent1"><span class="nm">(k)</span>Rav asked Karna for his name; when told, he requested that a Keren (horn) should sprout in Karna's eye - in the end, it did (Rav did not appreciate being tested. Ya'avetz - it is improper to ask someone weak from traveling; Rav was not held accountable for cursing him or for cursing Shmuel (below), since he was in great pain.)</p>
<p class="bas indent1"><span class="nm">(l)</span>Shmuel hosted Rav; he fed him barley bread, fish fried in its oil with flour and gave him beer to drink, but did not show him where the Beis ha'Kisei is (forcing Rav to hold it in would cure him).</p>
<p class="bas indent1"><span class="nm">(m)</span>Rav did not understand Shmuel's intent - he cursed him that he should never have sons - this was fulfilled [even though Rav regretted it when he found out the intent. On account of the curse, Rav put Shmuel's honor above his own, even though Rav was a greater Chacham - Bava Kama 80b.]</p>
<p class="bas indent1"><span class="nm">(n)</span>Rav's answer is the subject of an argument of Tana'im:</p>
<p class="bas indent2"><span class="nm">1.</span><span class="cl">(Beraisa) Question:</span> How do we know where to circumcise?</p>
<p class="bas indent2"><span class="nm">2.</span><span class="cl">Answer #1 (R. Yoshiyah):</span> It says 'Orlah', like it says regarding fruits of the first three years - just like there it refers to propagation, also regarding Milah.</p>
<p class="bas indent2"><span class="nm">3.</span><span class="cl">Answer #2 (R. Noson):</span> We need not learn from there - it says "V'Arel Zachar...", it is in the place that distinguishes males and females.</p>
<p class="bas indent1"><span class="nm">(o)</span><span class="cl">(Beraisa):</span> One may write Tefilin on skin of a Tahor Behemah or Chayah, even if it is a Nevelah or Treifah;</p>
<p class="bas indent1"><span class="nm">(p)</span>A tradition from Moshe from Sinai requires wrapping the parchments in the hair of a Tahor animal, and sewing them with sinews of a Tahor animal.</p>
<p class="bas indent1"><span class="nm">(q)</span>One may not write Tefilin on skin of a Tamei Behemah or Chayah, there is no need to say it is forbidden on skin of a Nevelah or Treifah of a Tamei species (slaughter does not apply, it always becomes Nevelah when it dies); the parchments may not be wrapped or sewn in their hair or sinews.</p>
<p class="bas indent2"><span class="nm">1.</span><span class="cl">Question (a Baisusi (heretic)):</span> What is the source to forbid writing Tefilin on skin of a Tamei Behemah?</p>
<p class="bas indent2"><span class="nm">2.</span><span class="cl">Answer (R. Yehoshua ha'Garsi):</span> "Lema'an Tihyeh Toras Hash-m b'Ficha" - it must be from something permitted to your mouth.</p>
<p class="bas indent2"><span class="nm">3.</span><span class="cl">Question (the Baisusi):</span> If so, it should be forbidden on skin of a Treifah or Nevelah!</p>
<p class="bas indent2"><span class="nm">4.</span><span class="cl">Answer (R. Yehoshua):</span> I answer you with a parable - there were two men sentenced to be executed, one was killed by the king, the other by the executioner - surely, the one killed by the king is superior! (Likewise, Nevelah is superior to a slaughtered animal.)</p>
<p class="bas indent2"><span class="nm">5.</span><span class="cl">Question (the Baisusi):</span> If so, it should be permitted to eat Nevelah!</p>
<p class="bas indent2"><span class="nm">6.</span><span class="cl">Answer (R. Yehoshua):</span> It says "Lo Sochlu Chol Nevelah".</p>
<p class="bas indent2"><span class="nm">7.</span>The Baisusi was pleased with the answer,</p>

<p class="bas indent1"><span class="nm">(a)</span><span class="cl">(Mishnah):</span> One may not make brine on Shabbos, but one may make saltwater and dip bread in it or add it to a cooked food (this will be explained);</p>
<p class="bas bbbline">108b----------------------------------------108b</p>
<p class="bas indent1"><span class="nm">(b)</span><span class="cl">R. Yosi:</span> Brine is the same, whether one makes a lot or a little!</p>
<p class="bas indent2"><span class="nm">1.</span>Rather, it is permitted to make saltwater if one puts oil into the water or salt first.</p>
<p class="bas indent1"><span class="nm">(c)</span><span class="cl">(Gemara):</span> Question: What does the first Tana say?</p>
<p class="bas indent1"><span class="nm">(d)</span><span class="cl">Answer (Rav Yehudah):</span> One may not make a large amount of saltwater on Shabbos, a small amount is permitted.</p>
<p class="bas indent1"><span class="nm">(e)</span><span class="cl">(Mishnah - R. Yosi):</span> Brine is the same, whether one makes a lot or a little!</p>
<p class="bas indent1"><span class="nm">(f)</span><span class="cl">Question:</span> Does R. Yosi permit or forbid?</p>
<p class="bas indent1"><span class="nm">(g)</span><span class="cl">Answer #1 (Rav Yehudah):</span> Since it does not say 'R. Yosi forbids', he permits.</p>
<p class="bas indent1"><span class="nm">(h)</span><span class="cl">Objection (Rabah - Seifa):</span> Rather, it is permitted to make saltwater if...</p>
<p class="bas indent2"><span class="nm">1.</span>This shows that he forbids [without oil first! Rashi - such saltwater is strong, putting food in it will resemble tanning; Rambam - it will resemble doing Melachah with food (this is like Rava, who says that tanning does not apply to food - Tosfos Yom Tov).]</p>
<p class="bas indent1"><span class="nm">(i)</span><span class="cl">Answer #2 (Rabah and R. Yochanan):</span> He forbids.</p>
<p class="bas indent1"><span class="nm">(j)</span><span class="cl">Support (Beraisa):</span> One may not make a large amount of saltwater to put in vegetables being pickled in a shard, but one may make a small amount to dip bread in it or add it to a cooked food.</p>
<p class="bas indent1"><span class="nm">(k)</span><span class="cl">R. Yosi:</span> Do we forbid a large amount and permit a small amount?! People will say that a large Melachah is forbidden, but a small amount is permitted!</p>
<p class="bas indent2"><span class="nm">1.</span>Rather, both of these are forbidden - it is permitted only if he puts oil into the water or salt first; he may not mix [pure] water and salt.</p>
<p class="bas indent1"><span class="nm">(l)</span><span class="cl">(R. Yehudah bar Chaviva - Beraisa):</span> One may not make strong saltwater.</p>
<p class="bas indent1"><span class="nm">(m)</span><span class="cl">Question:</span> What is strong saltwater?</p>
<p class="bas indent1"><span class="nm">(n)</span><span class="cl">Answer (Rabah and Rav Yosef):</span> It is so concentrated that an egg floats in it.</p>
<p class="bas indent2"><span class="nm">1.</span><span class="cl">Question:</span> How much salt makes it this concentrated?</p>
<p class="bas indent2"><span class="nm">2.</span><span class="cl">Answer (Abaye):</span> It is two thirds salt and one third water.</p>
<p class="bas indent2"><span class="nm">3.</span><span class="cl">Question:</span> Why do people make such strong saltwater?</p>
<p class="bas indent2"><span class="nm">4.</span><span class="cl">Answer (R. Avahu):</span> It is used for fat of fish.</p>
<p class="bas indent2"><span class="nm">5.</span><span class="cl">(R. Yehudah bar Chaviva - Beraisa):</span> One may not salt [at once several pieces of] a radish or egg on Shabbos (this hardens and improves them, it resembles tanning).</p>
<p class="bas indent1"><span class="nm">(o)</span><span class="cl">(Rav Chizkiyah):</span> A radish is forbidden, an egg is permitted.</p>
<p class="bas indent1"><span class="nm">(p)</span><span class="cl">(Rav Nachman):</span> At first I used to salt radishes [on Shabbos] - I thought, this makes it worse (blunts the sharpness, so it is not forbidden);</p>
<p class="bas indent2"><span class="nm">1.</span><span class="cl">(Shmuel):</span> Sharp radishes are beneficial.</p>
<p class="bas indent1"><span class="nm">(q)</span>After I heard Ula teach that in Eretz Yisrael they salt piles upon piles of them, I stopped salting [two at a time], but I do dip them [in saltwater when eating them].</p>
<p class="bas indent1"><span class="nm">(r)</span><span class="cl">(R. Yehudah bar Chaviva - Beraisa):</span> If not for the outer peel of radishes, Esrogim and [white of] eggs, they would [harden and] never leave the intestines.</p>
<p class="bas subject"><span class="nm">4)</span>CURES FOR THE EYES</p>
<p class="bas indent1"><span class="nm">(a)</span><span class="cl">(Rav Dimi):</span> No one ever drowned in the Dead Sea [the salt keeps people afloat].</p>
<p class="bas indent1"><span class="nm">(b)</span><span class="cl">(Rav Yosef):</span> Sodom was Nehefach (overturned - "Va'Yahafoch Es he'Arim ha'El..." (Bereishis 19:25)), everything about it is Hafuch (reversed) - people do not drown in it, but beams sink in it.</p>
<p class="bas indent1"><span class="nm">(c)</span><span class="cl">(Abaye):</span> No, Rav Dimi teaches a bigger Chidush - not only beams, which don't sink in any waters, don't sink in the Dead Sea - but even people, who drown in other waters, do not drown in it!</p>
<p class="bas indent1"><span class="nm">(d)</span><span class="cl">Question:</span> What difference does it make?</p>
<p class="bas indent1"><span class="nm">(e)</span><span class="cl">Answer:</span> (Since it is salty, it heals - therefore, one may not open and close his eye in it on Shabbos.) Ravin was walking in back of R. Yirmiyah on the bank of the Dead Sea; he asked if one may bathe in the water (perhaps it is forbidden mid'Rabanan on account of healing).</p>
<p class="bas indent1"><span class="nm">(f)</span><span class="cl">R. Yirmiyah:</span> It is permitted (it is not evident that it is done to heal).</p>
<p class="bas indent1"><span class="nm">(g)</span><span class="cl">Question (Ravin):</span> May one open and close his eye (so the water will enter)?</p>
<p class="bas indent1"><span class="nm">(h)</span><span class="cl">R. Yirmiyah:</span> I did not hear about this, I heard a related Halachah:</p>
<p class="bas indent2"><span class="nm">1.</span><span class="cl">(Shmuel's father or Levi):</span> One may not [open and close the eye to] put wine in the eye (clearly this is to heal); one may put wine <i>on</i> the eye;</p>
<p class="bas indent2"><span class="nm">2.</span><span class="cl">(The other of Shmuel's father and Levi):</span> One may not even put tasteless spit (i.e. of one who did not eat anything since waking up) on the eye (it is repulsive, surely it is not to wash it, rather, to heal).</p>
<p class="bas indent2"><span class="nm">3.</span><span class="cl">Deduction:</span> Shmuel's father said the former, for Shmuel taught that one may soak bread in wine and put it on the eye - surely, he heard this from his father!</p>
<p class="bas indent2"><span class="nm">4.</span><span class="cl">Objection:</span> Shmuel also taught that one may not even put tasteless spit on the eye - will you say that he heard also this from his father? If so, Levi did not teach either of them!</p>
<p class="bas indent2"><span class="nm">5.</span><span class="cl">Conclusion:</span> Shmuel heard one from his father and one from Levi - we cannot determine which he heard from which.</p>
<p class="bas indent1"><span class="nm">(i)</span><span class="cl">(Mar Ukva):</span> One may soak Kilor (a plaster for the eye) from before Shabbos and put it on the eye on Shabbos.</p>
<p class="bas indent1"><span class="nm">(j)</span>Bar Livai was opening and closing his eye.</p>
<p class="bas indent1"><span class="nm">(k)</span><span class="cl">Mar Ukva:</span> Surely, Shmuel did not permit this!</p>
<p class="bas indent1"><span class="nm">(l)</span>R. Yanai asked Mar Ukva to send Kilorim of Shmuel.</p>
<p class="bas indent1"><span class="nm">(m)</span><span class="cl">Mar Ukva:</span> I will send, lest you think that I am stingy - but Shmuel taught that a drop of cold water [on the eyes] in the morning and washing the hands and feet in hot water in the evening is better than all Kilorim.</p>
<p class="bas indent1"><span class="nm">(n)</span>In a Beraisa, R. Muna taught just like Shmuel.</p>
