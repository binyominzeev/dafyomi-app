<div class="subject"><span class="nm">1)</span><p>CARRYING ON AND BETWEEN ROOFS</p></div>
<div class="indent1"><span class="nm">(a)</span><p><span class="cl">Question (Rami bar Chama):</span> [According to Rav, according to Chachamim,] may one transfer between his roof and a pillar [in Reshus ha'Rabim]?</p></div>
<div class="indent2"><span class="nm">1.</span><p><span class="cl">Question:</span> Does he ask about transferring from a Karmelis to Reshus ha'Yachid?! (Surely, it is forbidden! Rashi - one may not carry more than four Amos on the roof. It is like a Karmelis. The pillar is 10 tall and four wide, so it is a Reshus ha'Yachid. R. Tam - the roof is Reshus ha'Yachid (one could carry there if he made an Eruv). The pillar is a Karmelis (it is less than 10 tall).)</p></div>
<div class="indent2"><span class="nm">2.</span><p><span class="cl">Answer:</span> Amidst his sharpness [he rushed to ask, and] he was not careful [to ask about the proper scenario].</p></div>
<div class="indent1"><span class="nm">(b)</span><p><span class="cl">Correction:</span> Rather, he meant to ask [about a case when there is no problem of transferring from a Karmelis to Reshus ha'Yachid, e.g.] whether one may transfer between his roof and the roof of an Achsadra (Rashi - a roof supported by four poles, without walls. It belongs to someone else. Tosfos (94a-b) - it has three walls, and few Diyurin.)</p></div>
<div class="indent2"><span class="nm">1.</span><p>Perhaps since neither is proper for Dirah, they are like one Reshus;</p></div>
<div class="indent2"><span class="nm">2.</span><p>Or, perhaps it is forbidden, just like from roof to roof is forbidden [because they are different Reshuyos]!</p></div>
<div class="indent1"><span class="nm">(c)</span><p><span class="cl">Question (Rav Bivi bar Abaye):</span> May one transfer between his roof and a ruin (Rashi; Tosfos - the roof of a ruin)?</p></div>
<div class="indent1"><span class="nm">(d)</span><p><span class="cl">Rav Kahana:</span> You ask [a question equivalent to] Rami bar Chama's question!</p></div>
<div class="indent1"><span class="nm">(e)</span><p><span class="cl">Rav Bivi:</span> Do not suspect me of doing so! The Achsadra is not proper for Dirah. (It does not have four walls.) We cannot learn to a ruin which [with simple renovations] is proper for Dirah. (Rami bar Chama asked about a pillar, and the Gemara said that he <i>should have</i> asked about an Achsadra! Perhaps Rav Bivi bar Abaye later heard that Rami himself asked about an Achsadra - Ga'on Yakov.)</p></div>
<div class="indent1"><span class="nm">(f)</span><p><span class="cl">Question:</span> Since a ruin is proper for Dirah, this is obvious! (Rashi - it is unlike a roof. Surely, it is like another Reshus! Tosfos - since a ruin is proper for Dirah, its roof is just like a roof of a house. Chachamim forbid transferring from one roof to another.)</p></div>
<div class="indent1"><span class="nm">(g)</span><p><span class="cl">Answer:</span> His question depends partially on Rami's question:</p></div>
<div class="indent2"><span class="nm">1.</span><p>If you will say that (Tosfos - the roof of) the Achsadra is not proper for Dirah [and therefore one may transfer between his roof and the Achsadra's roof], perhaps we forbid regarding a ruin, for it is proper for Dirah;</p></div>
<div class="indent2"><span class="nm">2.</span><p>Or, since no one dwells there, it is permitted!</p></div>
<div class="indent1"><span class="nm">(h)</span><p>This question is not resolved.</p></div>
<div class="indent1"><span class="nm">(i)</span><p><span class="cl">(Rav):</span> According to R. Meir, if [the heights of adjacent] roofs are within 10 Tefachim of each other, and according to Chachamim when there is an isolated roof [no roof adjoins it], one may carry on all of it [even according to R. Meir. We shall refer to the roofs in the singular, for they are like one Reshus);</p></div>
<div class="indent1"><span class="nm">(j)</span><p><span class="cl">(Shmuel):</span> One may carry only within four Amos.</p></div>
<div class="indent1"><span class="nm">(k)</span><p><span class="cl">Question:</span> Rav contradicts himself! (Rashi - above, he permits only four Amos because the roof is totally open to a Reshus to which it is forbidden, i.e. another roof. Also here, it is totally open to Reshus ha'Rabim! Tosfos ha'Rosh - since Rav does not say Gud Asik, the roof should be like Karmelis, for it has no Mechitzos!]</p></div>
<div class="indent1"><span class="nm">(l)</span><p><span class="cl">Answer:</span> Above, the Mechitzos [between houses] are not Nikarim [on the roof, therefore Rav does not say Gud Asik]. Here, the Mechitzos (the walls of the house(s) on the outside) are Nikarim.</p></div>
<div class="indent1"><span class="nm">(m)</span><p><span class="cl">Question:</span> Shmuel contradicts himself! (Above, he permits the entire roof.)</p></div>
<div class="indent1"><span class="nm">(n)</span><p><span class="cl">Answer:</span> Above he permits only when each roof is at most Beis Se'atayim. Here, he forbids when the area of the roof exceeds Beis Se'atayim;</p></div>
<div class="indent2"><span class="nm">1.</span><p>The walls below were made for the house(s), and not for [Dirah on] the roof. [Even if we consider the roof to be enclosed due to Gud Asik,] the roof is like a Karfef more than Beis Se'atayim which was not Hukaf l'Dirah, so one may carry only within four Amos.</p></div>
<div class="subject"><span class="nm">2)</span><p>CARRYING IN A BOAT</p></div>
<div class="indent1"><span class="nm">(a)</span><p><span class="cl">(Rav):</span> One may carry anywhere within a boat;</p></div>
<div class="indent1"><span class="nm">(b)</span><p><span class="cl">(Shmuel):</span> One may carry only within four Amos [if the boat is more than Beis Se'atayim].</p></div>
<div class="indent1"><span class="nm">(c)</span><p>Rav permits the entire boat because it has Mechitzos, (It is considered Hukaf l'Dirah);</p></div>
<div class="bbbline">90b----------------------------------------90b</p></div>
<div class="indent1"><span class="nm">(d)</span><p>Shmuel forbids, because the Mechitzos are [not for Dirah, rather, only] to keep the water out.</p></div>
<div class="indent1"><span class="nm">(e)</span><p><span class="cl">Version #1 (Rav Ashi) Question (R. Chiya bar Yosef, to Shmuel):</span> Is the Halachah like you, or like Rav?</p></div>
<div class="indent1"><span class="nm">(f)</span><p><span class="cl">Answer (Shmuel):</span> The Halachah follows Rav.</p></div>
<div class="indent1"><span class="nm">(g)</span><p><span class="cl">(R. Chiya bar Yosef):</span> Rav agrees that if one flipped [the boat] over, one may carry [on what is now on top] only within four Amos.</p></div>
<div class="indent1"><span class="nm">(h)</span><p><span class="cl">Question:</span> Why did he flip it over?</p></div>
<div class="indent2"><span class="nm">1.</span><p>If it was in order to dwell underneath it, [this is like remaking the Mechitzos l'Shem Dirah], it should be just like a roof! (Even though the Mechitzos were l'Shem Dirah below, also above is considered Hukaf l'Dirah, and even more than Beis Se'atayim is permitted.)</p></div>
<div class="indent1"><span class="nm">(i)</span><p><span class="cl">Answer:</span> He flipped it over in order to tar it.</p></div>
<div class="indent1"><span class="nm">(j)</span><p><span class="cl">Version #2 (Rav Acha brei d'Rava):</span> R. Chiya bar Yosef asked [Shmuel if the Halachah follows him or Rav] regarding an Achsadra:</p></div>
<div class="indent2"><span class="nm">1.</span><p><span class="cl">(Rav):</span> One may carry anywhere in an Achsadra in a valley. (It has a roof supported on poles in the corners, but no walls);</p></div>
<div class="indent2"><span class="nm">2.</span><p><span class="cl">(Shmuel):</span> One may carry only within four Amos.</p></div>
<div class="indent2"><span class="nm">3.</span><p>Rav permits the entire Achsadra. We say Pi Tikra Yored v'Sosem;</p></div>
<div class="indent2"><span class="nm">4.</span><p>Shmuel permits only within four Amos. We do not say Pi Tikra Yored v'Sosem.</p></div>
<div class="subject"><span class="nm">3)</span><p>TRANSFERRING BETWEEN RESHUYOS WITH DIFFERENT USES</p></div>
<div class="indent1"><span class="nm">(a)</span><p><span class="cl">Question:</span> According to Rav, R. Meir should permit transferring between a roof and a Chatzer! (Since one may carry anywhere on the roof, it is a proper Reshus ha'Yachid, like the Chatzer)!</p></div>
<div class="indent1"><span class="nm">(b)</span><p><span class="cl">Answer:</span> He decrees not to, like the decree of R. Yitzchak bar Avdimi. (When there are two adjacent similar Reshuyos, one may not transfer between them, lest one adjust a load on a mound 10 tall and four wide (a Reshus ha'Yachid) in Reshus ha'Rabim.)</p></div>
<div class="indent1"><span class="nm">(c)</span><p><span class="cl">Question:</span> According to Shmuel, Chachamim should permit transferring between a roof and a Karfef! (Rashi - both of them are more than Beis Se'atayim. Both are like Karmelis, for one may carry only within four Amos. Ri - both are at most Beis Se'atayim. A Karfef resembles a roof more than a Chatzer does, and one may transfer between a roof and a Chatzer!)</p></div>
<div class="indent1"><span class="nm">(d)</span><p><span class="cl">Answer (Rabah bar Ula):</span> They decree not to, lest the roof be diminished [from Beis Se'atayim and it will be a Reshus ha'Yachid, but one will still transfer between them - Rashi. Ri - perhaps part of the roof will cave in and the roof will be used more, and it will be considered Hukaf l'Dirah, unlike the Karfef.]</p></div>
<div class="indent1"><span class="nm">(e)</span><p><span class="cl">Question:</span> If so, they should also decree not to transfer between two Karfifos [above Beis Se'atayim], lest (Ri - the wall of) one of them be diminished!</p></div>
<div class="indent1"><span class="nm">(f)</span><p><span class="cl">Answer:</span> If a Karfef is diminished, this will be evident [because it has real Mechitzos]. If the roof is diminished, it will not be evident. (Ri - its change in status will not be evident even to people on the roof.)</p></div>
