<p class="bas indent1"><span class="nm">(a)</span><span class="cl">(R. Yochanan):</span> On Yom Kipur, one may break open nuts and pomegranates after Minchah, on account of Inuy.</p>
<p class="bas indent1"><span class="nm">(b)</span>The household of Rav Yehudah would cut (or rinse) cabbage; the household of Rabah would peel gourds.</p>
<p class="bas indent1"><span class="nm">(c)</span>Rabah saw that they were starting before Minchah - [to get them to cease,] he told them that a letter came from Eretz Yisrael saying that R. Yochanan forbids.</p>

<p class="bas indent1"><span class="nm">(c)</span>We may not read in them for this draws people away from [the lecture in] the Beis Medrash.</p>
<p class="bas indent1"><span class="nm">(d)</span><span class="cl">(Gemara - Rav Huna):</span> If Kisvei ha'Kodesh were written in Targum [Arame'ic translation] or any other language [other than Lashon ha'Kodesh], we may not save them from a fire;</p>
<p class="bas indent1"><span class="nm">(e)</span><span class="cl">(Rav Chisda):</span> We may save them from a fire.</p>
<p class="bas indent1"><span class="nm">(f)</span>They do not argue according to the opinion that permits to read in them - surely, he permits saving them;</p>
<p class="bas indent2"><span class="nm">1.</span>They argue according to the opinion that forbids reading them:</p>
<p class="bas indent2"><span class="nm">2.</span>Rav Huna forbids saving them, for we may not read them;</p>
<p class="bas indent2"><span class="nm">3.</span>Rav Chisda permits, to avoid disgrace to Kisvei ha'Kodesh.</p>
<p class="bas indent1"><span class="nm">(g)</span><span class="cl">Question (Mishnah):</span> One may save all Kisvei ha'Kodesh from a fire, whether or not we read in them, and even if they are written in another language.</p>
<p class="bas indent2"><span class="nm">1.</span><span class="cl">Suggestion:</span> Those we read are Nevi'im (i.e. Haftorah), those we do not read in are Kesuvim;</p>
<p class="bas indent2"><span class="nm">2.</span>Even if they are written in another language and we may not read in them, nevertheless we may save them - this refutes Rav Huna!</p>

<p class="bas indent1"><span class="nm">(i)</span><span class="cl">Answer #1 (Rav Huna):</span> Those we read in are Nevi'im, those we do not read in are Kesuvim;</p>
<p class="bas indent2"><span class="nm">1.</span>This discusses Seforim in Lashon ha'Kodesh - if they are written in another language, we may not save them - nevertheless, they require Genizah.</p>

<p class="bas indent1"><span class="nm">(m)</span><span class="cl">Question (against Rav Huna - Beraisa #1):</span> If they were written in Giftis, Midis, Ivris (Lashon ha'Kodesh, but the letters are not [Ashuris] like we write them today), Ilmis or Yevanis, even though one may not read them, we may save them from a fire.</p>
<p class="bas indent1"><span class="nm">(n)</span><span class="cl">Answer (Rav Huna):</span> Tana'im argue [as I and Rav Chisda do]:</p>
<p class="bas indent2"><span class="nm">1.</span><span class="cl">(Beraisa #2):</span> If they are written in Targum or any other language, we may save them from a fire;</p>
<p class="bas indent2"><span class="nm">2.</span>R. Yosi says, we may not save them.</p>
<p class="bas indent2"><span class="nm">3.</span><span class="cl">R. Yosi:</span> A case occurred, my father found R. Gamliel at the table of Yochanan ha'Nazuf reading Sefer Iyov in Targum.</p>
<p class="bas indent2"><span class="nm">4.</span><span class="cl">My father:</span> Your grandfather R. Gamliel [ha'Zaken] stood on a step in Har ha'Bayis; someone brought to him Sefer Iyov in Targum - he commanded to bury it under the rocks.</p>
<p class="bas indent2"><span class="nm">5.</span>R. Gamliel himself [accepted this and] commanded to bury the Sefer.</p>
<p class="bas indent2"><span class="nm">6.</span>R. Yosi b'Rebbi Yehudah says, they dumped a kneading trough full of mud over it.</p>
<p class="bas indent2"><span class="nm">7.</span><span class="cl">Objection #1 (Rebbi):</span> Where would they find mud in Har ha'Bayis? (Cement was used for building!)</p>

<p class="bas indent1"><span class="nm">(o)</span><span class="cl">Question:</span> Which Tana'im argue like Rav Huna and Rav Chisda?</p>
<p class="bas bbbline">115b----------------------------------------115b</p>
<p class="bas indent2"><span class="nm">1.</span><span class="cl">Suggestion:</span> The first Tana is like Rav Chisda, R. Yosi is like Rav Huna.</p>
<p class="bas indent2"><span class="nm">2.</span><span class="cl">Rejection:</span> Perhaps the first Tana permits reading in them and R. Yosi forbids [but no one holds like Rav Chisda, who permits saving something that one may not read]!</p>
<p class="bas indent1"><span class="nm">(p)</span><span class="cl">Answer:</span> R. Yosi is like Rav Huna, the Tana of Beraisa #1 is like Rav Chisda.</p>
<p class="bas subject"><span class="nm">3)</span>SAVING SOMETHING THAT IS NOT A PROPER SEFER</p>
<p class="bas indent1"><span class="nm">(a)</span><span class="cl">(Beraisa):</span> [Written] Berachos and Kemi'im, even though they have letters [of Hash-m's name] and verses from many Parshiyos, may not be saved from a fire, one must let them burn;</p>
<p class="bas indent2"><span class="nm">1.</span>This is why Chachamim said that one who writes Berachos is like one who burns Torah.</p>
<p class="bas indent2"><span class="nm">2.</span>A case occurred, people told R. Yishmael about someone who was writing Berachos. When R. Yishmael was ascending a ladder [to inspect], the man sensed this, and stashed loads of them in a flask of water.</p>
<p class="bas indent2"><span class="nm">3.</span><span class="cl">R. Yishmael:</span> You will be punished more for this [putting them in water] than for writing them!</p>
<p class="bas indent1"><span class="nm">(b)</span><span class="cl">Question (Reish Galusa):</span> If they were written in Lashon ha'Kodesh in yellow dye, red dye, sap or vitriol, do we save them?</p>
<p class="bas indent2"><span class="nm">1.</span>We ask according to Rav Huna and Rav Chisda.</p>
<p class="bas indent2"><span class="nm">2.</span>Perhaps Rav Huna forbids saving only when they are written in other languages, but he agrees here, for they are in Lashon ha'Kodesh;</p>
<p class="bas indent2"><span class="nm">3.</span>Perhaps Rav Chisda permits saving only when they are written in ink, for they will last, but he agrees here, for they will not last!</p>
<p class="bas indent1"><span class="nm">(c)</span><span class="cl">Answer (Rabah bar Rav Huna):</span> We may not save them.</p>
<p class="bas indent1"><span class="nm">(d)</span><span class="cl">Reish Galusa:</span> But Rav Hamnuna taught a Beraisa that permits!</p>
<p class="bas indent1"><span class="nm">(e)</span><span class="cl">Rabah bar Rav Huna:</span> If a Beraisa permits, I retract.</p>
<p class="bas indent1"><span class="nm">(f)</span><span class="cl">Question:</span> Which Beraisa permits?</p>
<p class="bas indent1"><span class="nm">(g)</span><span class="cl">Answer (Rav Ashi - Beraisa):</span> The only difference between Megilah [Esther] and [other] Seforim is that Seforim may be written in any language, but Megilah may be written only in Ashuris, in a Sefer, in ink.</p>
<p class="bas indent1"><span class="nm">(h)</span><span class="cl">Question (Rav Huna bar Chaluv):</span> If a Sefer Torah [is worn] and does not have 85 intact letters, like the Parashah "Va'Yhi bi'Nso'a ha'Aron" may we save it from a fire? (Ran - he asks according to Rebbi (below), who considers this Parashah itself to be a Sefer. Rashba - Rav Huna bar Chaluv knew the Beraisa (o) which requires 85 - he asked because he thought that Beraisa (j) argues with it.)</p>
<p class="bas indent2"><span class="nm">1.</span><span class="cl">Rav Nachman:</span> Why don't you ask about saving Parashas "Va'Yhi bi'Nso'a ha'Aron", itself, if it is missing a letter?</p>
<p class="bas indent2"><span class="nm">2.</span><span class="cl">Rav Huna:</span> Since that Parashah has Hash-m's name, surely we save it even if less than 85 letters remain - I ask about when [less than 85] letters remain [without Hash-m's name].</p>
<p class="bas indent1"><span class="nm">(i)</span><span class="cl">Answer (Rav Nachman):</span> One may not save it.</p>
<p class="bas indent1"><span class="nm">(j)</span><span class="cl">Question (Beraisa):</span> If Targum (words in Aramaic) were written like Mikra (in Lashon ha'Kodesh), or vice-versa, or if it was written in Ivris, we may save it from a fire - there is no need to say that we may save Targum in Sefer Ezra, Daniel or the Torah (where the text itself is Aramaic)!</p>
<p class="bas indent2"><span class="nm">1.</span><span class="cl">Question:</span> Where do we find Targum in the Torah?</p>
<p class="bas indent2"><span class="nm">2.</span><span class="cl">Answer:</span> [Lavan called Gal Ed] "Yegar Sahadusa".</p>
<p class="bas indent2"><span class="nm">3.</span>We save it, even though it is less than 85 letters!</p>
<p class="bas indent1"><span class="nm">(k)</span><span class="cl">Answer:</span> The Beraisa teaches that Targum can complete the Shi'ur of 85 letters.</p>
<p class="bas indent1"><span class="nm">(l)</span><span class="cl">Question:</span> Must the 85 letters be near each other, or may they be scattered?</p>
<p class="bas indent1"><span class="nm">(m)</span><span class="cl">Answer #1 (Rav Huna):</span> They must be near each other.</p>
<p class="bas indent1"><span class="nm">(n)</span><span class="cl">Answer #2 (Rav Chisda):</span> They may be scattered.</p>
<p class="bas indent1"><span class="nm">(o)</span><span class="cl">Question (Beraisa):</span> If 85 intact letters can be found in a deteriorated Sefer Torah, like Parashas "Va'Yhi bi'Nso'a ha'Aron", we may save it from a fire; if not, not.</p>
<p class="bas indent2"><span class="nm">1.</span>['Can be found' connotes that they are scattered] - Rav Huna is refuted.</p>
<p class="bas indent1"><span class="nm">(p)</span><span class="cl">Answer (Rav Chisda, on behalf of Rav Huna):</span> The letters are in words (the argument is about scattered letters that do not form words).</p>
