<p class="bas subject"><span class="nm">1)</span>TWO DOCUMENTS FOR THE SAME TRANSACTION</p>
<p class="bas indent1"><span class="nm">(a)</span><span class="cl">(Rav Huna):</span> She may collect whichever Kesuvah she wants.</p>
<p class="bas indent1"><span class="nm">(b)</span><span class="cl">Suggestion:</span> He argues with Rav Nachman.</p>
<p class="bas indent2"><span class="nm">1.</span><span class="cl">(Rav Nachman):</span> If there are two documents (of sale or gift for the same property to the same recipient) with different dates, the latter invalidates the former.</p>
<p class="bas indent1"><span class="nm">(c)</span><span class="cl">Rejection:</span> They need not argue!</p>
<p class="bas indent2"><span class="nm">1.</span><span class="cl">(Rav Papa):</span> Rav Nachman admits that if the second document adds on a date tree, it was written for the addition and does not invalidate the first document.</p>
<p class="bas indent2"><span class="nm">2.</span>Also in Rav Huna's case, the second Kesuvah adds to the first!</p>
<p class="bas indent1"><span class="nm">(d)</span>Clearly, if the first document was a sale and the second is a gift, the second does not invalidate the first. It was written to protect the buyer from the law of Bar Metzra. (When land is sold, the neighbors have first rights to buy it. This does not apply to gifts.)</p>
<p class="bas indent1"><span class="nm">(e)</span>All the more so, if the first was a gift, and the second was a sale, it does not invalidate the first. The second was written to guarantee the receiver compensation if the property will be taken by creditors.</p>
<p class="bas indent1"><span class="nm">(f)</span>When both are sale documents or both are gifts, the latter invalidates the former.</p>
<p class="bas indent1"><span class="nm">(g)</span><span class="cl">Question:</span> What is the reason?</p>
<p class="bas indent1"><span class="nm">(h)</span><span class="cl">Answer #1 (Rafram):</span> The recipient requested another document because he agrees that the first one is invalid.</p>
<p class="bas indent1"><span class="nm">(i)</span><span class="cl">Answer #2 (Rav Acha):</span> The recipient pardoned the earlier lien.</p>
<p class="bas indent1"><span class="nm">(j)</span>There are three practical differences between these reasons:</p>
<p class="bas indent2"><span class="nm">1.</span>According to Answer #1, the recipient invalidates the witnesses (or signatures) on his first document (he cannot rely on them for other documents);</p>
<p class="bas indent2"><span class="nm">2.</span>According to Answer #1, the recipient must pay for produce he ate from the land between the dates on the two documents;</p>
<p class="bas indent2"><span class="nm">3.</span>According to Answer #1, the seller must pay the property taxes for the period between the documents.</p>
<p class="bas indent1"><span class="nm">(k)</span><span class="cl">Question:</span> How do we rule (about question 4:a, Daf 43B)?</p>
<p class="bas indent1"><span class="nm">(l)</span><span class="cl">Answer (Rav Yehudah):</span> R. Eliezer bar R. Shimon says that 100 or 200 is collected from the Kidushin. Tosefes is collected from the Nisu'in;</p>
<p class="bas indent2"><span class="nm">1.</span>Chachamim say that all is collected from the Nisu'in.</p>
<p class="bas indent1"><span class="nm">(m)</span>The Halachah follows Chachamim.</p>
<p class="bas subject"><span class="nm">2)</span>TO WHICH CONVERTS DO THE LAWS OF <i>MOTZI</i> <i>SHEM</i> <i>RA</i> APPLY?</p>
<p class="bas indent1"><span class="nm">(a)</span><span class="cl">(Mishnah):</span> If a woman converted with her daughter and the daughter was Mezanah (while she was a Na'arah Me'orasah), she is strangled. She is not killed at her father's doorway, and there is no fine of 100 Shekalim if her husband is (falsely) Motzi Shem Ra against her;</p>
<p class="bas indent1"><span class="nm">(b)</span>If her mother converted between conception and birth, she is stoned (for such Znus), but not at her father's doorway, and there is no fine of 100;</p>
<p class="bas indent1"><span class="nm">(c)</span>If her mother converted before conception, she is like a Bas Yisrael in all respects.</p>
<p class="bas indent1"><span class="nm">(d)</span>Even if a girl has a father but her father has no doorway, or his house has a doorway but she has no father, her punishment is stoning;</p>
<p class="bas indent2"><span class="nm">1.</span>The Mitzvah is to stone her at the father's door. If this cannot be done, she is still stoned.</p>
<p class="bas bbbline">44b----------------------------------------44b</p>
<p class="bas indent1"><span class="nm">(e)</span><span class="cl">(Gemara - Reish Lakish):</span> "And she will die" teaches that she is stoned even if her mother converted between conception and birth.</p>
<p class="bas indent1"><span class="nm">(f)</span><span class="cl">Question:</span> If so, one who is Motzi Shem Ra on her should be lashed and pay!</p>
<p class="bas indent1"><span class="nm">(g)</span><span class="cl">Answer:</span> "And she will die" applies to execution, not to a fine.</p>
<p class="bas indent1"><span class="nm">(h)</span><span class="cl">Suggestion:</span> Perhaps this is only if the conversion was before conception!</p>
<p class="bas indent1"><span class="nm">(i)</span><span class="cl">Rejection:</span> Such a girl is a regular Bas Yisrael. The verse is not needed in such a case.</p>
<p class="bas indent1"><span class="nm">(j)</span><span class="cl">Suggestion:</span> Perhaps the verse includes even if the conversion was after birth!</p>
<p class="bas indent1"><span class="nm">(k)</span><span class="cl">Rejection:</span> "B'Yisrael" excludes this.</p>
<p class="bas subject"><span class="nm">3)</span><i>MOTZI</i> <i>SHEM</i> <i>RA</i> ON AN ORPHAN</p>
<p class="bas indent1"><span class="nm">(a)</span><span class="cl">(R. Yosi bar Chanina):</span> One who is Motzi Shem Ra on an orphan is exempt. "He will give to the father of the Na'arah" excludes an orphan.</p>
<p class="bas indent1"><span class="nm">(b)</span><span class="cl">Question (R. Yosi bar Avin - Beraisa - R. Yosi ha'Glili):</span> The repetition "Im Ma'en Yima'en" teaches that also an orphan receives a fine!</p>
<p class="bas indent1"><span class="nm">(c)</span><span class="cl">Answer (R. Yosi bar Avin):</span> That is when she was orphaned between the seduction and the trial.</p>
<p class="bas indent1"><span class="nm">(d)</span><span class="cl">(Rava):</span> One who is Motzi Shem Ra on an orphan is punished:</p>
<p class="bas indent2"><span class="nm">1.</span><span class="cl">(Ami - Beraisa):</span> "A virgin of Yisrael" excludes a virgin convert.</p>
<p class="bas indent2"><span class="nm">2.</span><span class="cl">Question:</span> We understand this if Motzi Shem Ra on an orphan is normally punished. The verse exempts Motzi Shem Ra on a convert.</p>
<p class="bas indent3"><span class="nm">i.</span>But if one is always exempt for an orphan, why must a verse exempt for a convert? (According to Halachah, she has no father!)</p>
<p class="bas indent1"><span class="nm">(e)</span><span class="cl">(Reish Lakish):</span> Motzi Shem Ra on a minor is exempt - "He will give to the father of the Na'arah." Na'arah is written full (with a Hei), to teach that we discuss a full (adult) Na'arah.</p>
<p class="bas indent1"><span class="nm">(f)</span><span class="cl">Objection (Rav Acha bar Aba):</span> Even without the Hei, we would know that a minor is not included!</p>
<p class="bas indent2"><span class="nm">1.</span>"The Na'arah... will be stoned" - we do not punish a minor!</p>
<p class="bas indent2"><span class="nm">2.</span>Rather, here the Torah discusses a full Na'arah. When Na'arah is written without a Hei, it includes even a minor.</p>
