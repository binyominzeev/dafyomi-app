<div class="subject"><span class="nm">1)</span><p>TANA'IM THAT AGREE WITH R. YISHMAEL</p></div>
<div class="indent1"><span class="nm">(a)</span><p><span class="cl">Rejection #1:</span> (They need not agree with each other.) R. Yishmael minimizes exertion when this does not entail disgrace of Kodshim. Perhaps regarding Pesach he permits like Chachamim, in order to avoid disgrace to Kodshim (that a Korban be left half-flayed, like a Neveilah, until evening!)</p></div>
<div class="indent1"><span class="nm">(b)</span><p><span class="cl">Rejection #2:</span> R. Yishmael ben R. Yochanan forbids exertion not needed for the sake of the Avodah. (After flaying until the chest, the Eimurim can be removed.) Perhaps regarding the Omer he permits like Chachamim, for the sake of the Avodah! (It is better to use five Sa'im.)</p></div>
<div class="indent1"><span class="nm">(c)</span><p><span class="cl">Retraction (Rabah):</span> Rather, R. Yishmael and R. Chanina Segan ha'Kohanim agree with each other;</p></div>
<div class="indent2"><span class="nm">1.</span><p><span class="cl">(Mishnah - R. Chanina):</span> On Shabbos, one person reaps it using one sickle and one box. On a weekday, three people reap it, with three sickles and three boxes;</p></div>
<div class="indent2"><span class="nm">2.</span><p>Chachamim say, whether or not it is Shabbos, they (three people) reap it with three sickles and three boxes.</p></div>
<div class="indent2"><span class="nm">3.</span><p>R. Chanina forbids unnecessary exertion on Shabbos. Presumably, he forbids also unnecessary reaping on Shabbos!</p></div>
<div class="indent1"><span class="nm">(d)</span><p><span class="cl">Rejection #1:</span> Normally, R. Yishmael minimizes extra exertion. However, Chachamim want to publicize that the reaping is on the 16th (Rashi; R. Gershom - that the reaping is Docheh Shabbos). Perhaps he agrees three people reap it on Shabbos.</p></div>
<div class="indent1"><span class="nm">(e)</span><p><span class="cl">Rejection #2:</span> R. Chanina minimizes the number of people reaping, for the Avodah is done just as well. Perhaps he agrees that we reap the same quantity on Shabbos as a weekday, for this is a need of (optimal) Avodah.</p></div>
<div class="indent1"><span class="nm">(f)</span><p><span class="cl">(Rav Ashi):</span> R. Yishmael and R. Yosi agree with each other:</p></div>
<div class="indent2"><span class="nm">1.</span><p><span class="cl">(Mishnah):</span> If the new moon was seen on Shabbos, whether or not it was clearly seen by everyone, witnesses desecrate Shabbos in any way necessary (Rashi - in order to come to Yerushalayim to testify; R. Gershom - messengers may desecrate Shabbos to inform distant places that the 30th day was made Rosh Chodesh);</p></div>
<div class="indent2"><span class="nm">2.</span><p>R. Yosi says, if it was clearly seen by everyone, they may not desecrate Shabbos (presumably, Beis Din (Rashi; R. Gershom - everyone) saw it.)</p></div>
<div class="indent2"><span class="nm">3.</span><p>R. Yosi holds that since it is possible (that there is no need), we do not desecrate Shabbos. Likewise, since it is possible to reap only three Sa'im, we do not reap more.</p></div>
<div class="indent1"><span class="nm">(g)</span><p><span class="cl">Rejection #1:</span> R. Yishmael minimizes extra exertion when this will not cause people to sin. Regarding Rosh Chodesh, if they do not desecrate Shabbos when it was seen clearly, perhaps they will not desecrate it when (there is a need to, i.e.) it is not seen clearly;</p></div>
<div class="indent1"><span class="nm">(h)</span><p><span class="cl">Rejection #2:</span> R. Yosi does not allow desecration of Shabbos due to concern for the future, since there is no need for today's Avodah that is Docheh Shabbos. Perhaps he agrees that when the Avodah is Docheh Shabbos (e.g. reaping the Omer), we do not limit the exertion!</p></div>
<div class="subject"><span class="nm">2)</span><p>DOING MORE THAN IS PERMITTED ON SHABBOS</p></div>
<div class="indent1"><span class="nm">(a)</span><p><span class="cl">(Rabah or R. Ami):</span> If one slaughtered two Chata'os of the Tzibur (on a Shabbos when exactly one is needed, e.g. Rosh Chodesh. He thought that this is permitted), he is liable for the second, he is exempt for the first;</p></div>
<div class="indent2"><span class="nm">1.</span><p>This is true even if (the first was Nifsal and) the Tzibur fulfilled its obligation with the second, or if the first was lean (and the second was fat).</p></div>
<div class="indent1"><span class="nm">(b)</span><p><span class="cl">Contradiction:</span> Rabah does not obligate in this case!</p></div>
<div class="indent2"><span class="nm">1.</span><p><span class="cl">(Rabah):</span> If one had two animals available for a Chatas Tzibur (on Shabbos), one lean and one fat:</p></div>
<div class="indent3"><span class="nm">i.</span><p>If he slaughtered the fat one and then the lean one, he is liable;</p></div>
<div class="indent3"><span class="nm">ii.</span><p>If he slaughtered the lean one and then the fat one, he is exempt. Further, if he already slaughtered the lean one, l'Chatchilah he should slaughter the fat one (and offer it!)</p></div>
<div class="indent1"><span class="nm">(c)</span><p><span class="cl">Answer #1:</span> We must delete (from a:1) the clause 'or if the first was lean.'</p></div>
<div class="indent1"><span class="nm">(d)</span><p><span class="cl">Answer #2:</span> We must say that R. Ami taught this, not Rabah.</p></div>
<div class="indent1"><span class="nm">(e)</span><p><span class="cl">Question (Ravina):</span> If (after slaughtering the second,) the first was found to be lean in the intestines (R. Gershom - there is no Chelev to offer), what is the law?</p></div>
<div class="indent2"><span class="nm">1.</span><p>If it depends on intent, he is liable. (Since he did not know that the first is lean, he had no permission to slaughter);</p></div>
<div class="indent2"><span class="nm">2.</span><p>If it depends on the action done, he is exempt (since it was a Mitzvah to slaughter the second.)</p></div>
<div class="indent1"><span class="nm">(f)</span><p><span class="cl">Version #1 - Answer (Rav Ashi):</span> Rabah and Rava agree that in such a case he is liable!</p></div>
<div class="indent2"><span class="nm">1.</span><p>If (on Shabbos) Reuven heard that a child was drowning in the sea and he set a trap to catch fish and fish were trapped, he is liable;</p></div>
<div class="indent2"><span class="nm">2.</span><p><span class="cl">(Rabah):</span> If the child was saved in the trap and fish were trapped, he is exempt;</p></div>
<div class="indent2"><span class="nm">3.</span><p><span class="cl">(Rava):</span> He is liable.</p></div>
<div class="indent3"><span class="nm">i.</span><p>Rabah assumes that since he heard that a child was drowning, surely he also intended to save the child;</p></div>
<div class="indent3"><span class="nm">ii.</span><p>Had he not heard, all agree that he is liable.</p></div>
<div class="indent1"><span class="nm">(g)</span><p><span class="cl">Version #2 - Answer (Rav Ashi):</span> Rabah and Rava argue about your question:</p></div>
<div class="indent2"><span class="nm">1.</span><p>If Reuven heard that a child was drowning and he set a trap to catch fish and fish were trapped, he is liable;</p></div>
<div class="indent2"><span class="nm">2.</span><p><span class="cl">(Rabah):</span> If the child was saved and fish were trapped, he is exempt;</p></div>
<div class="indent2"><span class="nm">3.</span><p><span class="cl">(Rava):</span> He is liable.</p></div>
<div class="indent2"><span class="nm">4.</span><p>Rabah exempts, for he says that it depends on the action done. (He saved the child. This is a Mitzvah);</p></div>
<div class="indent2"><span class="nm">5.</span><p>Rava is Mechayev. He says that it depends on intent.</p></div>
<div class="indent1"><span class="nm">(h)</span><p><span class="cl">(Rabah):</span> If (on Shabbos) doctors said that a fig is needed to save Shimon's life and 10 people ran and each brought one at the same time, all are exempt (for all the Melachos they had to do);</p></div>
<div class="indent2"><span class="nm">1.</span><p>All are exempt even if they came one after the other, and even if Shimon recovered before they picked the figs.</p></div>
<div class="indent1"><span class="nm">(i)</span><p><span class="cl">Question (Rava):</span> If doctors said that two figs are needed to save Shimon's life and one finds two isolated figs on a tree, and one branch with three figs, which should he bring?</p></div>
<div class="indent2"><span class="nm">1.</span><p>Perhaps he should take the two, for he only takes what is necessary;</p></div>
<div class="indent2"><span class="nm">2.</span><p>Perhaps he should take the branch with three, for this minimizes reaping. (One act suffices!)</p></div>
<div class="indent1"><span class="nm">(j)</span><p><span class="cl">Answer:</span> Surely, he should take the branch;</p></div>
<div class="bbbline">64b----------------------------------------64b</p></div>
<div class="indent2"><span class="nm">1.</span><p>R. Shimon forbids reaping a larger quantity only when it entails more acts of reaping. Here, reaping a larger quantity entails less acts. Surely this is better!</p></div>
<div class="subject"><span class="nm">3)</span><p>FROM WHERE WE BRING THE OMER</p></div>
<div class="indent1"><span class="nm">(a)</span><p><span class="cl">(Mishnah):</span> L'Chatchilah, the Omer must be brought from a place close (to Yerushalayim);</p></div>
<div class="indent1"><span class="nm">(b)</span><p>If no barley near Yerushalayim is ripe, it may be brought from anywhere (in Eretz Yisrael);</p></div>
<div class="indent2"><span class="nm">1.</span><p>It once occurred that the Omer was brought from (a place called) Gagos Tzerifin, and Shtei ha'Lechem were brought from Ein Socher.</p></div>
<div class="indent1"><span class="nm">(c)</span><p><span class="cl">(Gemara) Question:</span> Why must it be brought from a close place?</p></div>
<div class="indent1"><span class="nm">(d)</span><p>Answer #1 The Omer must be Karmel (soft. If it were brought from afar, it could dry up);</p></div>
<div class="indent1"><span class="nm">(e)</span><p><span class="cl">Answer #2:</span> We do not pass over Mitzvos. (Once we find a suitable place, we do the Mitzvah immediately.)</p></div>
<div class="indent1"><span class="nm">(f)</span><p><span class="cl">(Mishnah):</span> It once occurred that the Omer was brought from Gagos Tzerifin...</p></div>
<div class="indent1"><span class="nm">(g)</span><p><span class="cl">(Beraisa):</span> When the Chashmonai kings were fighting each other, Hurkanus was inside Yerushalayim, and Aristobelus was besieging it from outside. Every day, they would lower a basket of coins from the wall, and the besiegers would give them lambs Kosher for the daily Korban, which they would lift over the wall.</p></div>
<div class="indent2"><span class="nm">1.</span><p>An old man told the besiegers, in the language of Chachmas Yevanis, that they will not conquer it as long as they are bringing the Korbanos. The next day, the besiegers gave a pig instead of lambs. When the pig was halfway up, it stuck its claws into the wall; Eretz Yisrael shook 400 Parsah.</p></div>
<div class="indent3"><span class="nm">i.</span><p>Chachamim imposed a curse on anyone who will raise pigs or teach his son Chachmas Yevanis.</p></div>
<div class="indent2"><span class="nm">2.</span><p>Regarding that period we learned that the Omer was brought from barley from Gagos Tzrifin and Shtei ha'Lechem were brought from wheat of Ein Socher.</p></div>
<div class="indent1"><span class="nm">(h)</span><p>When it was time to bring the Omer, they did not know where to get it. They announced that anyone who knows should tell.</p></div>
<div class="indent2"><span class="nm">1.</span><p>A mute man came and put one hand on the Gag (roof) and the other on a Tzerif (hut).</p></div>
<div class="indent2"><span class="nm">2.</span><p><span class="cl">Mordechai:</span> Is there a place called Gagos Tzerifin or Tzerifin Gagos? (Rashi - this is the Mordechai who defeated Haman. Tosfos - that Mordechai died long before this. The appointee over the box with money for Kinim (a Ken is two birds for Korbanos) was called 'Mordechai'.)</p></div>
<div class="indent2"><span class="nm">3.</span><p>They found that there was such a place.</p></div>
<div class="indent1"><span class="nm">(i)</span><p>The same occurred when it was time to bring Shtei ha'Lechem. The mute came and put one hand on his eye and the other on the Sichra (the hole for the door bolt).</p></div>
<div class="indent2"><span class="nm">1.</span><p><span class="cl">Mordechai:</span> Is there a place called Ein Socher or Socher Ayin?</p></div>
<div class="indent2"><span class="nm">2.</span><p>They found that there was such a place.</p></div>
<div class="indent1"><span class="nm">(j)</span><p>Three women came. Each had a Ken to offer. One said 'this is for Zivasi', one said 'for Yamasi', and one said 'For Onasi', People assumed that each Ken was (Chovah,) one Chatas and one Olah. (Rashi - each was for Zivah. Yamasi means 'my Yam (sea of blood).' Onasi means 'my time (to bring a Korban, after seven consecutive days without blood).</p></div>
<div class="indent1"><span class="nm">(k)</span><p><span class="cl">Mordechai:</span> Perhaps each Ken is Nedavah (two Olos), in appreciation of salvation from Zivasi (heavy bleeding), Yamasi (danger at sea) and Onasi (a dangerous eye illness).</p></div>
<div class="indent1"><span class="nm">(l)</span><p>They asked the women. It was exactly like Mordechai said.</p></div>
