<div class="indent1"><span class="nm">(a)</span><p><span class="cl">Question:</span> But the cited Beraisa (which forbids cutting the ropes on Shabbos) argues with the <i>second</i> part of Shmuel's teaching!?</p></div>
<div class="indent1"><span class="nm">(b)</span><p><span class="cl">Answer:</span> That Beraisa is the view of R. Nechemyah, who forbids moving Kelim for any other than their intended use (and knives are made to cut food, not ropes).</p></div>
<div class="indent1"><span class="nm">(c)</span><p><span class="cl">Question:</span> Then why did that Beraisa speak only of Shabbos (when the Isur would apply to Yom Tov as well)!?</p></div>
<div class="indent1"><span class="nm">(d)</span><p><span class="cl">Answer:</span> R. Nechemyah differentiates between Muktzah of Shabbos versus Yom Tov.</p></div>
<div class="indent1"><span class="nm">(e)</span><p><span class="cl">Question:</span> It is not logical to differentiate between Shabbos and Yom Tov, and (in the course of resolving three Beraisos) we see that R. Nechemyah forbids burning Kelim (and this must be speaking of Yom Tov)!?</p></div>
<div class="indent1"><span class="nm">(f)</span><p><span class="cl">Answer:</span> There is a Machlokes Tanaim as to whether or not R. Nechemyah extended his Isur to Yom Tov.</p></div>

<div class="indent1"><span class="nm">(a)</span><p><span class="cl">Question:</span> Who holds that such an act renders the clay a Kli!?</p></div>
<div class="indent1"><span class="nm">(b)</span><p><span class="cl">Answer (R. Yosef):</span> It is R. Meir who (argues with R. Yehoshua and) holds a Kli Cheres is subject to Tum'ah even without being fired in a kiln.</p></div>
<div class="indent1"><span class="nm">(c)</span><p><span class="cl">Question (Abaye):</span> Perhaps R. Meir only considers an earthenware vessel complete when it can be used for something!?</p></div>
<div class="indent1"><span class="nm">(d)</span><p><span class="cl">Answer:</span> Our Kli is already fit for small coins.</p></div>
<div class="indent1"><span class="nm">(e)</span><p><span class="cl">(Alternate rendition of above) Answer (R. Yosef):</span> It is R. Eliezer b'Rebbi Tzadok who holds that (in the Mishnah in Eduyos) that the Kelim remain Tahor even if a Zav moves them because they have not yet been completed.</p></div>
<div class="indent1"><span class="nm">(f)</span><p><span class="cl">Question (Abaye):</span> Perhaps R. Eliezer b'Rebbi Tzadok only considers it a Kli when it can be used for something!?</p></div>

<div class="indent1"><span class="nm">(a)</span><p><span class="cl">Question:</span> This prohibition seems obvious!?</p></div>
<div class="indent1"><span class="nm">(b)</span><p><span class="cl">Answer:</span> We might have erroneously permitted them for bathing on Yom Tov.</p></div>
<div class="indent1"><span class="nm">(c)</span><p><span class="cl">Question:</span> But such bathing is prohibited on Yom Tov (and the prohibition is, again, obvious)!?</p></div>
<div class="indent1"><span class="nm">(d)</span><p><span class="cl">Answer:</span> We might have permitted their use for a Turkish bath (prior to the Gezeirah to consider it bathing).</p></div>

<div class="indent1"><span class="nm">(a)</span><p><span class="cl">Question:</span> Why is slicing the wick more stringent (R. Yehudah) than burning it in two (both are Tikun Maneh)?</p></div>
<div class="indent1"><span class="nm">(b)</span><p><span class="cl">Answer (R. Chiya):</span> By lighting it between two candles it is not clear that he is doing so to split it (he may be kindling the two lights simultaneously).</p></div>

<div class="indent1"><span class="nm">(b)</span><p><span class="cl">Answer (R. Ashi):</span> We use clay from the banks of the Euphrates, which does not require mixing (and then only when properly designated before Yom Tov).</p></div>
