<p class="bas subject"><span class="nm">1)</span>THE SOURCES THAT TEACH ABOUT <i>ME'ILAH</i></p>
<p class="bas indent1"><span class="nm">(a)</span><span class="cl">Question:</span> One (a non-Kohen) is liable for Terumah for (eating it, thereby) making it Chulin. (If we learn from Terumah, there should be Me'ilah only for making Hekdesh Chulin);</p>
<p class="bas indent2"><span class="nm">1.</span>What is the source to obligate one who changes Hekdesh to another kind of Hekdesh, e.g. he took Hekdesh money and used it to buy Kinim (birds) needed for Korbanos of a Zav, Zavah or Yoledes, to give his half-Shekel, or to bring his Chatas or Asham?</p>
<p class="bas indent3"><span class="nm">i.</span>According to R. Shimon, he is Mo'el from the time he was Motzi (spent the money. We explain like R. Peretz, unlike Rashi);</p>
<p class="bas indent3"><span class="nm">ii.</span>According to R. Yehudah, he is Mo'el from the time of Zerikah.</p>
<p class="bas indent1"><span class="nm">(b)</span><span class="cl">Answer:</span> "Sim'ol Ma'al" includes this.</p>
<p class="bas indent1"><span class="nm">(c)</span><span class="cl">(Beraisa):</span> "Nefesh" refers to a commoner, Nasi or Mashu'ach.</p>
<p class="bas indent1"><span class="nm">(d)</span><span class="cl">Objection:</span> This is obvious. Each is a "Nefesh"! (Why must the Tana teach it?)</p>
<p class="bas indent1"><span class="nm">(e)</span><span class="cl">Answer - Suggestion:</span> Since it says "va'Asher Yiten Minenu Al Zar," and one may anoint a Mashu'ach (and in some cases, a Nasi) with (Hekdesh) Shemen ha'Mishchah, this shows that Me'ilah does not apply to him!</p>
<p class="bas indent2"><span class="nm">1.</span><span class="cl">Rejection:</span> The Tana teaches that this is not so.</p>
<p class="bas indent1"><span class="nm">(f)</span>It was necessary for the Torah to equate Me'ilah to Sotah, idolatry and Terumah;</p>
<p class="bas indent2"><span class="nm">1.</span>A Sotah is called Mo'eles even without Pegam. We learn that also Me'ilah applies without Pegam, e.g. wearing a Hekdesh ring;</p>
<p class="bas indent2"><span class="nm">2.</span><span class="cl">Version #1 (Rashi):</span> From idolatry we learn that Me'ilah always connotes Shinuy, e.g. chopping (Chulin) with a Hekdesh axe;</p>
<p class="bas indent2"><span class="nm">3.</span><span class="cl">Version #2 (Tosfos):</span> From idolatry we learn that Me'ilah applies when there is a Shinuy (even without benefit, if an act of Kinyan was done), e.g. chopping with a Hekdesh axe. (This effects a loan of an axe, according to Rav Huna); (end of Version #2)</p>
<p class="bas indent2"><span class="nm">4.</span>Regarding Terumah it says "Ki Yochal" to exclude one who damages. We learn that likewise, one who damages Hekdesh food (Tosfos - or eats it in a way that harms himself) is exempt. (Most Rishonim exempt one who damages inedible Hekdesh. R. Gershom obligates him.)</p>
<p class="bas subject"><span class="nm">2)</span>WHEN <i>PEGAM</i> IS REQUIRED</p>
<p class="bas indent1"><span class="nm">(a)</span><span class="cl">(Mishnah):</span> (One is Mo'el without Pegam... ) she wore a choker on her neck...</p>
<p class="bas indent1"><span class="nm">(b)</span><span class="cl">Question (Rav Kahana):</span> How can the Mishnah say that gold is not prone to Pegam? Nan (a certain wealthy man) gave gold ornaments to his daughter-in-law, and later it was found that they weighed less!</p>
<p class="bas indent1"><span class="nm">(c)</span><span class="cl">Answer #1 (Rav Zevid):</span> Perhaps she was careless with it, like your daughters-in-law! (However, if she guarded properly, there would be no Pegam.)</p>
<p class="bas indent1"><span class="nm">(d)</span><span class="cl">Answer #2 (Rav Zevid):</span> Even if you will say that there is Pegam, it does not come immediately, only over time. (Therefore, one is Mo'el now without a Shavah Perutah of Pegam.)</p>
<p class="bas indent1"><span class="nm">(e)</span><span class="cl">(Mishnah):</span> If one benefits from a live Chatas (he was not Mo'el unless he was Pogem).</p>
<p class="bas indent1"><span class="nm">(f)</span><span class="cl">Question:</span> If it is Tam, it should be like a cup of Hekdesh (it is not prone to Pegam. Even if he shears or weakens it, it is Mechaper for him, and it does not lose value with regard to Hekdesh.)</p>
<p class="bas indent1"><span class="nm">(g)</span><span class="cl">Answer (Rav Papa):</span> The Mishnah discusses a Ba'al Mum.</p>
<p class="bas bbbline">19b----------------------------------------19b</p>
<p class="bas subject"><span class="nm">3)</span>MO'EL ACHAR MO'EL</p>
<p class="bas indent1"><span class="nm">(a)</span><span class="cl">(Mishnah):</span> If one benefited a half Perutah (from Hekdesh) and was Pogem a half Perutah, or benefited a Perutah in one object and was Pogem a Perutah in another object, he was not Mo'el;</p>
<p class="bas indent1"><span class="nm">(b)</span>To be Mo'el, one must benefit a Perutah and be Pogem a Perutah in the same object.</p>
<p class="bas indent1"><span class="nm">(c)</span>(Normally, after one is Mo'el in an object, it becomes Chulin, and Me'ilah no longer applies.) The only cases of Mo'el after Mo'el (if different people benefited from the same item of Hekdesh one after the other, are all Mo'el) are a Behemah (or other Kodshei Mizbe'ach) and a Kli Shares. (They have Kedushas ha'Guf. They do not become Chulin as long as they are Kosher for Avodah);</p>
<p class="bas indent2"><span class="nm">1.</span>Mo'el after Mo'el applies to people who rode on a Korban (one after the other), or drank from a Hekdesh cup, or detached wool from a Chatas.</p>
<p class="bas indent1"><span class="nm">(d)</span>Rebbi says, Mo'el after Mo'el applies to anything that cannot be redeemed.</p>
<p class="bas indent1"><span class="nm">(e)</span><span class="cl">(Gemara) Question:</span> Who is the Tana of the Mishnah?</p>
<p class="bas indent1"><span class="nm">(f)</span><span class="cl">Answer:</span> It is R. Nechemyah:</p>
<p class="bas indent2"><span class="nm">1.</span><span class="cl">(Beraisa):</span> Mo'el after Mo'el applies only to a Behemah;</p>
<p class="bas indent2"><span class="nm">2.</span>R. Nechemyah says, it applies also to a Kli Shares.</p>
<p class="bas indent1"><span class="nm">(g)</span><span class="cl">Question:</span> What is the first Tana's reason?</p>
<p class="bas indent1"><span class="nm">(h)</span><span class="cl">Answer:</span> In the Parshah of Asham Me'ilos, "b'Eil ha'Asham" is repeated. (Rashi - even after one was Mo'el in the ram, it is still called Asham, so Me'ilah still applies to it. Pirush Kadmon (A) - "Sim'ol Ma'al" includes Mo'el after Mo'el. This was taught regarding a Korban, to teach that Mo'el after Mo'el applies only to Korbanos.)</p>
<p class="bas indent1"><span class="nm">(i)</span>R. Nechemyah learns from a Kal va'Chomer. Klei Shares are Mekadesh what is put inside them (Shitah - the contents gets Kedushas ha'Guf, so Mo'el after Mo'el applies), all the more so the Kli itself has Kedushah for Mo'el after Mo'el!</p>
<p class="bas indent1"><span class="nm">(j)</span><span class="cl">(Mishnah - Rebbi):</span> Mo'el after Mo'el applies to anything that cannot be redeemed.</p>
<p class="bas indent1"><span class="nm">(k)</span><span class="cl">Question:</span> How does Rebbi argue with the first Tana?</p>
<p class="bas indent1"><span class="nm">(l)</span><span class="cl">Answer #1 (Rava):</span> They argue about wood Hukdash to Hekdesh. (Rebbi says that it has Kedushas ha'Guf, so there is Mo'el after Mo'el):</p>
<p class="bas indent2"><span class="nm">1.</span><span class="cl">(Beraisa):</span> If one vowed to bring wood he must bring at least two large logs;</p>
<p class="bas indent2"><span class="nm">2.</span>Rebbi says, wood is considered a Korban. It requires salt and Hagashah. (A verse compares it to a Minchah.)</p>
<p class="bas indent2"><span class="nm">3.</span><span class="cl">(Rava):</span> According to Rebbi, wood requires (must be burned on) other wood (on the Mizbe'ach).</p>
<p class="bas indent2"><span class="nm">4.</span><span class="cl">(Rav Papa):</span> According to Rebbi, wood requires Kemitzah. (Rashi in Menachos 106b - the wood is ground up until Kemitzah can be taken. R. Gershom there - Kohanim receive the Shirayim. Tosfos in Menachos 20b - the Shirayim are burned on the Mizbe'ach after the Kometz. Pirush Kadmon - a Minchah is brought with Korban Etzim. Kemitzah is taken from it.)</p>
<p class="bas indent1"><span class="nm">(m)</span><span class="cl">Version #1 (our text) Answer #2 (Rav Papa):</span> They argue about Tam Kodshei Mizbe'ach that became blemished and were slaughtered (this was forbidden. Rebbi holds that Ha'amadah and Ha'arachah is required (but cannot be done), so they cannot be redeemed, so there is Mo'el after Mo'el. Chachamim do not require Ha'amadah and Ha'arachah, so they allow redemption.)</p>
<p class="bas indent1"><span class="nm">(n)</span><span class="cl">Version #2 (Tosfos) Answer #2 (Rav Papa):</span> They argue about Tam Kodshei Mizbe'ach that became blemished (and are still alive). (Rebbi holds that since even with a Mum they still cannot be redeemed (until Ha'amadah and Ha'arachah), they still are not considered prone to Pegam, so there is Mo'el after Mo'el. Chachamim say, since redemption is possible (after Ha'amadah and Ha'arachah), they are prone to Pegam, so there is not Mo'el after Mo'el.) (end of Version #2)</p>
<p class="bas indent1"><span class="nm">(o)</span><span class="cl">Support (Beraisa - Rebbi):</span> If a Tam Korban became blemished and was slaughtered, it must be buried. (It is as if has Kedushas ha'Guf);</p>
<p class="bas indent2"><span class="nm">1.</span>Chachamim say, it is redeemed.</p>
