<p class="bas subject"><span class="nm">1)</span>DO ALL PERMIT VOWS OF PERSUASION?</p>
<p class="bas indent1"><span class="nm">(a)</span><span class="cl">Answer #1 (Mishnah):</span> If Reuven told Shimon 'It is forbidden for me to benefit from you if you will not take from me a Kor of wheat and two barrels of wine for your son', Shimon can permit the vow without a Chacham;</p>
<p class="bas indent2"><span class="nm">1.</span>He can say 'You vowed only for my honor. This itself is my honor (that people see that you wanted to give to me, and I did not want to take).'</p>
<p class="bas indent2"><span class="nm">2.</span><span class="cl">Inference:</span> Had he not said this, the vow would be binding.</p>
<p class="bas indent2"><span class="nm">3.</span><span class="cl">Question:</span> Like whom is the Mishnah?</p>
<p class="bas indent3"><span class="nm">i.</span>It is not like R. Eliezer ben Yakov. He says that this is a vow of persuasion!</p>
<p class="bas indent2"><span class="nm">4.</span><span class="cl">Answer:</span> Rather, it is like Chachamim. This shows that they disagree with R. Eliezer ben Yakov.</p>
<p class="bas indent1"><span class="nm">(b)</span><span class="cl">Rejection:</span> Really, it is like R. Eliezer ben Yakov.</p>
<p class="bas indent2"><span class="nm">1.</span>He agrees that this is a real vow. Reuven does not want to be like a dog, to take from Shimon without giving in return.</p>
<p class="bas indent1"><span class="nm">(c)</span><span class="cl">Answer #2 (Mishnah - R. Meir):</span> If Reuven said to Shimon 'It is forbidden for you to benefit from me if you will not give to my son a Kor of wheat and two barrels of wine', the vow is binding until Shimon gives;</p>
<p class="bas indent2"><span class="nm">1.</span>Chachamim say that Reuven can permit his own vow without a Chacham. He can say 'I consider it as if I received.'</p>
<p class="bas indent2"><span class="nm">2.</span><span class="cl">Inference:</span> had he not said this, the vow would be binding.</p>
<p class="bas indent2"><span class="nm">3.</span><span class="cl">Question:</span> Like whom is the Mishnah?</p>
<p class="bas indent3"><span class="nm">i.</span>It is not like R. Eliezer ben Yakov. He says that this is a vow of persuasion!</p>
<p class="bas indent2"><span class="nm">4.</span><span class="cl">Answer:</span> Rather, it must be Chachamim. This shows that they disagree with R. Eliezer ben Yakov.</p>
<p class="bas indent1"><span class="nm">(d)</span><span class="cl">Rejection:</span> Really, it is like R. Eliezer ben Yakov.</p>
<p class="bas indent2"><span class="nm">1.</span>He agrees that this is a real vow. Reuven is not a king, he cannot constantly give to Shimon without receiving in return.</p>
<p class="bas indent1"><span class="nm">(e)</span><span class="cl">Answer #3 (Mar Kashisha, son of Rav Chisda - Mishnah):</span> The following are vows of Ones (beyond one's control): Reuven vowed that Shimon must eat by him, and Shimon or Shimon's son got sick, or Shimon could not cross the river.</p>
<p class="bas indent2"><span class="nm">1.</span><span class="cl">Inference:</span> If not for the Ones, the vow would stand!</p>
<p class="bas indent2"><span class="nm">2.</span><span class="cl">Question:</span> Like whom is the Mishnah?</p>
<p class="bas indent3"><span class="nm">i.</span>It is not like R. Eliezer ben Yakov. He says that this is a vow of persuasion!</p>
<p class="bas indent2"><span class="nm">3.</span><span class="cl">Answer:</span> Rather, it must be like Chachamim. This shows that they disagree with R. Eliezer ben Yakov.</p>
<p class="bas indent1"><span class="nm">(f)</span><span class="cl">Rejection:</span> Really, it is like R. Eliezer ben Yakov.</p>
<p class="bas indent2"><span class="nm">1.</span>Reuven did not initiate the vow, rather, Shimon did!</p>
<p class="bas indent2"><span class="nm">2.</span>Shimon asked to eat by Reuven; Reuven agreed. Shimon asked Reuven to forbid things to himself if Shimon will not eat by him.</p>
<p class="bas indent2"><span class="nm">3.</span>(Since Reuven was not trying to persuade Shimon, this is not a vow of persuasion); if not for the Ones, the vow would stand.</p>
<p class="bas indent1"><span class="nm">(g)</span><span class="cl">Answer #4 (Beraisa):</span> R. Eliezer ben Yakov said an even bigger Chidush. If Reuven told Shimon 'I will not benefit from you if you do not eat hot bread and have a hot drink by me' and Shimon refused, this is a vow of persuasion. Chachamim did not agree to this.</p>
<p class="bas indent2"><span class="nm">1.</span><span class="cl">Suggestion:</span> Chachamim disagreed, even in the previous cases.</p>
<p class="bas bbbline">24b----------------------------------------24b</p>
<p class="bas indent2"><span class="nm">2.</span><span class="cl">Version #1 (our text) Conclusion:</span> Chachamim disagree with R. Eliezer ben Yakov.</p>
<p class="bas indent2"><span class="nm">3.</span><span class="cl">Version #2 (in Tosfos and Ran) Rejection:</span> No, Chachamim argue only in this case. (End of Version #2)</p>
<p class="bas indent1"><span class="nm">(h)</span><span class="cl">Question:</span> Like whom is the law?</p>
<p class="bas indent1"><span class="nm">(i)</span><span class="cl">Answer (Rav Huna and Rav Ada bar Ahavah):</span> The Halachah follows R. Eliezer ben Yakov.</p>
<p class="bas subject"><span class="nm">2)</span>VOWS OF EXAGGERATION</p>
<p class="bas indent1"><span class="nm">(a)</span><span class="cl">(Mishnah):</span> The following are vows of exaggeration: '... are forbidden to me if I did not see on this road as many (people) as left Mitzrayim', or 'if I did not see a snake like the beam of an olive press.'</p>
<p class="bas indent1"><span class="nm">(b)</span><span class="cl">(Gemara - Beraisa):</span> Vows of exaggeration are permitted. Oaths of exaggeration are forbidden (Rosh - mid'Rabanan. Alternatively, the text should say 'likewise, oaths of exaggeration are permitted.)</p>
<p class="bas indent1"><span class="nm">(c)</span><span class="cl">Question:</span> What are oaths of exaggeration?</p>
<p class="bas indent2"><span class="nm">1.</span>If he said 'I swear, if I did not see on this road...', this means nothing! (Ran; Rosh - he did not forbid anything!)</p>
<p class="bas indent1"><span class="nm">(d)</span><span class="cl">Answer #1 (Abaye):</span> Rather, he said, 'I swear that I saw...'.</p>
<p class="bas indent1"><span class="nm">(e)</span><span class="cl">Objection #1 (Rava):</span> If so, this is obvious! (Rosh - that it is forbidden to swear thusly; Ran - that this is permitted!)</p>
<p class="bas indent1"><span class="nm">(f)</span><span class="cl">Objection #2 (Rava):</span> Oaths of exaggeration should resemble vows of exaggeration! (Rosh - that he forbade something to himself; Ran - that it applies even when he is clearly lying, i.e. I saw a snake like a beam of an olive press.)</p>
<p class="bas indent1"><span class="nm">(g)</span><span class="cl">Answer #2 (Rava):</span> He said 'all Peiros are forbidden to me with an oath if I did not see on this road as many as left Mitzrayim.'</p>
<p class="bas indent1"><span class="nm">(h)</span><span class="cl">Question (Ravina):</span> Perhaps he means that he saw that many ants, and his oath is true!</p>
