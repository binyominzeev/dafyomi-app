<div class="subject"><span class="nm">1)</span><p>WHO RECEIVES A SHARE OF <i>KODSHIM</i> (cont.)</p></div>
<div class="indent1"><span class="nm">(a)</span><p><span class="cl">(Gemara) Question:</span> What is the source of this?</p></div>
<div class="indent1"><span class="nm">(b)</span><p><span class="cl">Answer (Reish Lakish):</span> "Ha'Kohen ha'Mechatei Osah Yochalenah" - only a Kohen who is Mechatei (serves) will eat.</p></div>
<div class="indent1"><span class="nm">(c)</span><p><span class="cl">Question:</span> This is not always true!</p></div>
<div class="indent2"><span class="nm">1.</span><p>Not all the Kohanim in the Mishmar do Avodah, yet all eat!</p></div>
<div class="indent1"><span class="nm">(d)</span><p><span class="cl">Answer:</span> Reish Lakish means that only a Kohen who is <i>able</i> to do Avodah will eat.</p></div>
<div class="indent1"><span class="nm">(e)</span><p><span class="cl">Question:</span> A minor may not do Avodah, yet he may eat!</p></div>
<div class="indent1"><span class="nm">(f)</span><p><span class="cl">Answer:</span> He means, only a Kohen who is able to do Avodah <i>receives a portion</i> to eat.</p></div>
<div class="indent1"><span class="nm">(g)</span><p><span class="cl">Question:</span> A Ba'al Mum may not do Avodah, yet he receives a portion to eat!</p></div>
<div class="indent1"><span class="nm">(h)</span><p><span class="cl">Answer:</span> "Kol Zachar ba'Kohanim" includes a Ba'al Mum (he receives a portion).</p></div>
<div class="indent1"><span class="nm">(i)</span><p><span class="cl">Question:</span> Perhaps this includes a Tevul Yom!</p></div>
<div class="indent1"><span class="nm">(j)</span><p><span class="cl">Answer #1:</span> It is more reasonable to include a Ba'al Mum, for he is (now) permitted to eat.</p></div>
<div class="indent2"><span class="nm">1.</span><p><span class="cl">Question:</span> It is more reasonable to include a Tevul Yom, for he will be Kosher (even for Avodah) at night (e.g. Haktaras Chelev)!</p></div>
<div class="indent2"><span class="nm">2.</span><p><span class="cl">Answer:</span> A Tevul Yom is not Kosher now.</p></div>
<div class="indent1"><span class="nm">(k)</span><p><span class="cl">Answer #2 (Rav Yosef) Question:</span> "Yochalenu" really means, Yechalkenu (he will receive a share).- Why does it say "Yochalenu"?</p></div>
<div class="indent2"><span class="nm">1.</span><p><span class="cl">Answer:</span> This teaches that only one permitted to eat receives a share.</p></div>
<div class="indent1"><span class="nm">(l)</span><p><span class="cl">Question (Reish Lakish):</span> If a Ba'al Mum was Tamei, does he receive a share?</p></div>
<div class="indent2"><span class="nm">1.</span><p>Since he receives a share even though he cannot serve, we do not distinguish whether or not he is Tamei;</p></div>
<div class="indent2"><span class="nm">2.</span><p>Or, perhaps only somone who may eat (now) receives a share?</p></div>
<div class="indent1"><span class="nm">(m)</span><p><span class="cl">Answer (Rabah - Beraisa):</span> A Kohen Gadol may serve when he is an Onen, but he may not eat and does not receive a share to eat at night.</p></div>
<div class="indent2"><span class="nm">1.</span><p>This teaches that only eone who may eat receives a share.</p></div>
<div class="indent1"><span class="nm">(n)</span><p><span class="cl">Question (R. Oshaya):</span> Does a Tamei receive a share of Korbanos Tzibur?</p></div>
<div class="indent2"><span class="nm">1.</span><p>It says "ha'Mechatei" (will receive a share). A Tamei is Kosher for Korbanos Tzibur (b'Di'eved, or even l'Chatchilah if there are no Tahor Kohanim, so he should receive);</p></div>
<div class="indent2"><span class="nm">2.</span><p>Or, perhaps only one who may eat (now) receives a share?</p></div>
<div class="indent1"><span class="nm">(o)</span><p><span class="cl">Answer (Ravina - Beraisa):</span> A Kohen Gadol may serve when he is an Onen, but he may not eat and does not receive a share to eat at night.</p></div>
<div class="indent2"><span class="nm">1.</span><p>This teaches that only one who may eat receives a share.</p></div>
<div class="subject"><span class="nm">2)</span><p>AN <i>ONEN</i> MUST IMMERSE FOR <i>KODSHIM</i></p></div>
<div class="indent1"><span class="nm">(a)</span><p><span class="cl">(Our Mishnah):</span> An Onen may touch Kodshim, but he may not serve...</p></div>
<div class="indent1"><span class="nm">(b)</span><p><span class="cl">Contradiction (Mishnah A):</span> An Onen or Mechusar Kipurim must immerse for Kodshim. (We are thinking that he must immerse before touching it.)</p></div>
<div class="indent1"><span class="nm">(c)</span><p><span class="cl">Answer #1 (R. Ami):</span> He may touch after immersing, but not before immersing.</p></div>
<div class="indent1"><span class="nm">(d)</span><p><span class="cl">Question:</span> Even after immersing, he is still (forbidden to Kodshim like) an Onen!</p></div>
<div class="indent2"><span class="nm">1.</span><p><span class="cl">(Rabah bar bar Chanah):</span> If an Onen immersed (on the day of death), he is still an Onen.</p></div>
<div class="indent1"><span class="nm">(e)</span><p><span class="cl">Answer:</span> He may touch Kodshim if he was not Mesi'ach Da'as (cease guarding himself from Tum'ah). If he was Mesi'ach Da'as, he must immerse again.</p></div>
<div class="indent1"><span class="nm">(f)</span><p><span class="cl">Question:</span> If he was Mesi'ach Da'as, he is forbidden to Kodshim for seven days! (He must be sprinkled with Mei Chatas. Tevilah is not enough!)</p></div>
<div class="indent2"><span class="nm">1.</span><p><span class="cl">(R. Yostai b'Rebbi Mason):</span> If one was Mesi'ach Da'as, Mei Chatas must be sprinkled on him on days three and seven. (We are concerned lest he became Tamei Mes.)</p></div>
<div class="indent1"><span class="nm">(g)</span><p><span class="cl">Answer:</span> R. Yostai's law applies when he was Mesi'ach Da'as from Tum'as Mes. R. Ami's law applies to one who was Mesi'ach Da'as from Tum'as Sheretz, but not from Tum'as Mes.</p></div>
<div class="indent1"><span class="nm">(h)</span><p><span class="cl">Rejection #1:</span> If (we suspect that) he touched a Sheretz, he is fully Tamei. Even after immersing he may not touch Kodshim until evening!</p></div>
<div class="indent1"><span class="nm">(i)</span><p><span class="cl">Rejection #2:</span> If (we suspect that) he touched a Sheretz, he must immerse even for Terumah!</p></div>
<div class="indent1"><span class="nm">(j)</span><p><span class="cl">Answer (R. Yirmeyah):</span> The case is, he guarded himself from something that would be Metamei him (mid'Oraisa), but not from something that would disqualify him (mid'Rabanan).</p></div>
<div class="indent1"><span class="nm">(k)</span><p><span class="cl">Question:</span> Can we say that he guards from one thing, but not from another?!</p></div>
<div class="indent1"><span class="nm">(l)</span><p><span class="cl">Answer:</span> Yes!</p></div>
<div class="indent2"><span class="nm">1.</span><p><span class="cl">(Beraisa):</span> If a man was carrying a basket on his head with a rake fork inside, and he was guarding the basket but not the rake, the basket is Tahor, and the rake is Tamei.</p></div>
<div class="bbbline">99b----------------------------------------99b</p></div>
<div class="indent2"><span class="nm">2.</span><p><span class="cl">Question:</span> The rake should be Metamei the basket!</p></div>
<div class="indent2"><span class="nm">3.</span><p><span class="cl">Answer:</span> A Kli (unless it became an Av ha'Tum'ah of Tum'as Mes) is not Metamei another Kli.</p></div>
<div class="indent2"><span class="nm">4.</span><p><span class="cl">Question:</span> The rake should be Metamei the contents of the basket!</p></div>
<div class="indent2"><span class="nm">5.</span><p><span class="cl">Answer (Rava):</span> The case is, he guarded the rake from something that would Metamei it (to be Metamei Chulin), but not from something that would disqualify it (mid'Rabanan, i.e. Tamei liquids - Tosfos Chagigah 20a).</p></div>
<div class="indent1"><span class="nm">(m)</span><p><span class="cl">Answer #2 (to Contradiction (b) - R. Aba bar Mamal):</span> R. Yochanan taught that one who eats a Shelishi (third-degree Tamei food) may not eat Terumah, but he may touch Terumah;</p></div>
<div class="indent2"><span class="nm">1.</span><p>This shows that we are more stringent about eating than touching;</p></div>
<div class="indent2"><span class="nm">2.</span><p>Likewise, an Onen must immerse before <i>eating</i> Kodshim, but not before touching it. (Mishnah A discusses eating.)</p></div>
<div class="subject"><span class="nm">3)</span><p><i>ANINUS LAYLAH</i></p></div>
<div class="indent1"><span class="nm">(a)</span><p><span class="cl">(Mishnah):</span> He does not receive a share to eat at night.</p></div>
<div class="indent1"><span class="nm">(b)</span><p><span class="cl">Inference:</span> He does not receive a share, but others may invite him to eat from their share.</p></div>
<div class="indent1"><span class="nm">(c)</span><p><span class="cl">Contradiction (Mishnah #1):</span> An Onen immerses and eats Korban Pesach at night. He may not eat other Kodshim.</p></div>
<div class="indent1"><span class="nm">(d)</span><p><span class="cl">Answer #1 (R. Yirmeyah mi'Difti):</span> (Normally, Aninus applies mid'Rabanan at night, so he may not eat Kodshim.) Since Chachamim allow him to eat Korban Pesach (for one who does not bring Pesach is Chayav Kares), they permit him to eat all Kodshim on this night;</p></div>
<div class="indent2"><span class="nm">1.</span><p>On other nights, he has no permission to eat any Kodshim.</p></div>
<div class="indent2"><span class="nm">2.</span><p>Mishnah #1 says 'he may not eat other Kodshim', i.e. on any other day, he may not eat Kodshim at night.</p></div>
<div class="indent1"><span class="nm">(e)</span><p><span class="cl">Answer #2 (Rav Asi):</span> If his relative died on the 14th (of Nisan) and was buried on the 14th, he may eat Pesach but not other Kodshim that night (for Aninus of the night following the death is mid'Rabanan, Chachamim did not decree regarding Pesach);</p></div>
<div class="indent2"><span class="nm">1.</span><p>If the death was on the 13th and the burial was on the 14th, he may eat any Kodshim that night. (Chachamim did not decree Aninus on the night following burial.)</p></div>
<div class="indent1"><span class="nm">(f)</span><p><span class="cl">Question:</span> Who is the Tana of Mishnah #1, who holds that Aninus Laylah (of the night after death) is only mid'Rabanan?</p></div>
<div class="indent1"><span class="nm">(g)</span><p><span class="cl">Answer:</span> It is R. Shimon;</p></div>
<div class="indent2"><span class="nm">1.</span><p><span class="cl">(Beraisa - R. Yehudah):</span> Aninus Laylah is mid'Oraisa;</p></div>
<div class="indent2"><span class="nm">2.</span><p>R. Shimon says, it is only mid'Rabanan.</p></div>
<div class="indent2"><span class="nm">3.</span><p><span class="cl">R. Shimon:</span> Surely I am right. (You agree that earlier) Chachamim taught that an Onen immerses and eats Pesach at night, but not other Kodshim!</p></div>
<div class="indent1"><span class="nm">(h)</span><p><span class="cl">Question:</span> R. Shimon holds that Aninus Laylah is mid'Oraisa!</p></div>
<div class="indent2"><span class="nm">1.</span><p><span class="cl">(Beraisa - R. Shimon):</span> An Onen may not offer a Korban through a Shali'ach.</p></div>
<div class="indent3"><span class="nm">i.</span><p><span class="cl">Suggestion:</span> He may not offer even Korban Pesach (because he may not eat at night, for Aninus Laylah is mid'Oraisa)!</p></div>
<div class="indent1"><span class="nm">(i)</span><p><span class="cl">Answer:</span> No, he may not offer any Korban other than Pesach through a Shali'ach.</p></div>
<div class="indent1"><span class="nm">(j)</span><p><span class="cl">Question (Beraisa - R. Shimon):</span> "Shelamim" - one must be Shalem (settled, i.e. not an Onen) to bring this Korban.</p></div>
<div class="indent2"><span class="nm">1.</span><p><span class="cl">Question:</span> What is the source that the same applies to Todah?</p></div>
<div class="indent2"><span class="nm">2.</span><p><span class="cl">Answer:</span> Todah has the same law as Shelamim, for one may fulfill the Mitzvah of Simchah through eating Todah, just like Shelamim (and Todah is called Shelamim.)</p></div>
<div class="indent2"><span class="nm">3.</span><p><span class="cl">Question:</span> What is the source for Olah?</p></div>
<div class="indent2"><span class="nm">4.</span><p><span class="cl">Answer:</span> Olah has the same law, for it may be brought voluntarily like Shelamim.</p></div>
<div class="indent2"><span class="nm">5.</span><p><span class="cl">Question:</span> What is the source for Bechor, Ma'aser and Pesach?</p></div>
<div class="indent2"><span class="nm">6.</span><p><span class="cl">Answer:</span> These have the same law, for they are not brought due to sin, like Shelamim.</p></div>
<div class="indent2"><span class="nm">7.</span><p><span class="cl">Question:</span> What is the source for Chatas and Asham?</p></div>
<div class="indent2"><span class="nm">8.</span><p><span class="cl">Answer:</span> "Zevach" includes them.</p></div>
<div class="indent2"><span class="nm">9.</span><p><span class="cl">Question:</span> What is the source for birds, Menachos, wine, (Rashi - the Korban that accompanies) wood and frankincense?</p></div>
<div class="indent2"><span class="nm">10.</span><p><span class="cl">Answer:</span> "Shelamim Korbano" - he must be Shalem to bring any Korban.</p></div>
<div class="indent2"><span class="nm">11.</span><p><span class="cl">Summation of question:</span> It says that an Onen may not bring Pesach!</p></div>
<div class="indent1"><span class="nm">(k)</span><p><span class="cl">Answer #1 (Rav Chisda):</span> Pesach was taught Kedi (for no reason, along with Bechor and Ma'aser. Really, the law does not apply to Pesach.)</p></div>
<div class="indent1"><span class="nm">(l)</span><p><span class="cl">Answer #2 (Rav Sheshes):</span> In this Beraisa, 'Pesach' refers to Shalmei Pesach (Rashi - Chagigah of the 14th. It is eaten on Pesach night for satiation before eating the Pesach.)</p></div>
<div class="indent1"><span class="nm">(m)</span><p><span class="cl">Question:</span> Shalmei Pesach is a Shelamim. This was already taught!</p></div>
<div class="indent1"><span class="nm">(n)</span><p><span class="cl">Answer:</span> The Tana teaches Shelamim that come due to Pesach, and Shelamim that come on their own;</p></div>
<div class="indent2"><span class="nm">1.</span><p>Had he not taught Shelamim due to Pesach, one might have thought that it is just like Pesach (and an Onen may bring it).</p></div>
