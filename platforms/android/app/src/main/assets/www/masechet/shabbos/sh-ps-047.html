<p class="bas indent1"><span class="nm">(a)</span><span class="cl">(R. Yochanan):</span> R. Rumnus said that Rebbi permitted him to move [in Rebbi's house] an incense pan with ashes in it (the pan has permitted uses; we are thinking that the ashes were forbidden).</p>
<p class="bas indent1"><span class="nm">(b)</span><span class="cl">Question (R. Zeira):</span> But R. Yochanan forbids this!</p>
<p class="bas indent2"><span class="nm">1.</span><span class="cl">(Mishnah):</span> One may carry his son while his son is holding a rock, or a basket with a rock in it.</p>
<p class="bas indent2"><span class="nm">2.</span><span class="cl">(R. Yochanan):</span> The case is, there are fruits in the basket.</p>
<p class="bas indent2"><span class="nm">3.</span><span class="cl">Inference:</span> If there are no fruits inside, it is forbidden!</p>
<p class="bas indent1"><span class="nm">(c)</span><span class="cl">Answer #1 (R. Asi):</span> The case is, [in addition to the ashes] there are sticks of frankincense left in the pan [that did not burn, one can smell them - therefore, this is like a basket with fruits and a rock].</p>
<p class="bas indent1"><span class="nm">(d)</span><span class="cl">Objection:</span> Sticks of frankincense are of no significance in the house of Rebbi (he was very rich)!</p>
<p class="bas indent2"><span class="nm">1.</span><span class="cl">Suggestion:</span> Perhaps because they are significant for Aniyim (poor people), they are significance for everyone!</p>
<p class="bas indent2"><span class="nm">2.</span><span class="cl">Rejection:</span> Aniyim may move cloths of Aniyim (they are three by three fingers, they can be used for a patch), Ashirim may move clothes of Ashirim (e.g. three Tefachim by three Tefachim), but not of Aniyim.</p>
<p class="bas indent1"><span class="nm">(e)</span><span class="cl">Answer #2 (Abaye):</span> It may be moved, just like a privy may be removed (because it disgusts one).</p>
<p class="bas indent1"><span class="nm">(f)</span><span class="cl">Objection #1 (Rava):</span> A privy disgusts people, ashes do not!</p>
<p class="bas indent1"><span class="nm">(g)</span><span class="cl">Objection #2 (Rava):</span> A privy is exposed, the ashes are covered!</p>
<p class="bas indent1"><span class="nm">(h)</span><span class="cl">Answer #3 (Rava):</span> In Rav Nachman's house, they would move a pan on account of ashes (which can be used to cover spit or excrement), even though there are broken pieces of wood inside. (Rebbi gave this same Heter to R. Rumnus.)</p>
<p class="bas indent1"><span class="nm">(i)</span><span class="cl">Question (Beraisa):</span> All agree that if there are broken wicks inside [the Ner, one may not move it].</p>
<p class="bas indent1"><span class="nm">(j)</span><span class="cl">Answer (Abaye):</span> The Beraisa refers to Galil [where oil is abundant (Rashi - wicks are scarce), therefore the wicks are not Betelim].</p>
<p class="bas subject"><span class="nm">2)</span>ASSEMBLING THINGS THAT COME APART</p>
<p class="bas indent1"><span class="nm">(a)</span><span class="cl">Question (Levi bar Shmuel):</span> May one assemble a bed of Tarsim? (These are traveling craftsmen. The bed comes apart.)</p>
<p class="bas indent1"><span class="nm">(b)</span><span class="cl">Answer (R. Aba and Rav Huna bar Chiya):</span> It is permitted.</p>
<p class="bas indent1"><span class="nm">(c)</span><span class="cl">Rav Yehudah:</span> Rav and Shmuel say that one who assembles such a bed is liable!</p>
<p class="bas indent1"><span class="nm">(d)</span><span class="cl">Question (against R. Aba and Rav Huna - Beraisa):</span> One who assembles a Menorah of rings [that come apart] is liable;</p>
<p class="bas indent2"><span class="nm">1.</span>One may not assemble a plasterer's rod - if he did so, he is exempt.</p>
<p class="bas indent2"><span class="nm">2.</span>R. Simai says, one who inserts [a flute] in a round horn [a musical instrument with holes] is liable [for it must be wedged in tightly]; one who inserts it in a straight horn is exempt (it goes in loosely).</p>
<p class="bas indent1"><span class="nm">(e)</span><span class="cl">Answer:</span> R. Aba and Rav Huna hold like R. Shimon ben Gamliel:</p>
<p class="bas indent2"><span class="nm">1.</span><span class="cl">(Beraisa):</span> One may not return Malbenos (coverings for legs) of beds, legs of beds, or the wood on a bow (on which the arrow rests) - if he did so, he is exempt;</p>
<p class="bas bbbline">47b----------------------------------------47b</p>
<p class="bas indent2"><span class="nm">2.</span>He may not bang them in tightly - if he did, he brings a Chatas;</p>
<p class="bas indent2"><span class="nm">3.</span>R. Shimon ben Gamliel says, if they fit loosely, it is permitted. (Tosfos - Rav and Shmuel discussed a tight fitting bed.)</p>
<p class="bas indent1"><span class="nm">(f)</span>There was a Gelalnisa bed (like of Tarsim) in Rav Chama's house, he would assemble it on Yom Tov.</p>
<p class="bas indent1"><span class="nm">(g)</span><span class="cl">Question (a Chacham, to Rava):</span> Do you [not rebuke him because you] hold that [it is not wedged in tightly, so] this is like building non-professionally? Granted, it is permitted mid'Oraisa, but it is forbidden mid'Rabanan!</p>
<p class="bas indent1"><span class="nm">(h)</span><span class="cl">Answer (Rava):</span> I hold like R. Shimon ben Gamliel, who permits if it fits loosely.</p>
<p class="bas subject"><span class="nm">3)</span>CATCHING SPARKS IN A UTENSIL</p>
<p class="bas indent1"><span class="nm">(a)</span><span class="cl">(Mishnah):</span> One may put a Kli under a Ner to catch sparks; one may not put water in it, for this extinguishes.</p>
<p class="bas indent1"><span class="nm">(b)</span><span class="cl">(Gemara) Question:</span> The Kli will become Muktzeh (Rav Chisda forbids to make a Kli Muktzeh on Shabbos)!</p>
<p class="bas indent1"><span class="nm">(c)</span><span class="cl">Answer (Rav Huna brei d'Rav Yehoshua):</span> Sparks have no substance (one may move the Kli).</p>
<p class="bas indent1"><span class="nm">(d)</span><span class="cl">(Mishnah):</span> One may not put water in it, for this extinguishes.</p>
<p class="bas indent1"><span class="nm">(e)</span><span class="cl">Suggestion:</span> Our Stam Mishnah is like R. Yosi, who forbids causing to extinguish.</p>
<p class="bas indent1"><span class="nm">(f)</span><span class="cl">Objection:</span> R. Yosi forbids causing to extinguish on Shabbos, he does not forbid before Shabbos something that will cause extinguishing on Shabbos!</p>
<p class="bas indent1"><span class="nm">(g)</span><span class="cl">Answer:</span> Perhaps our Mishnah only discusses [putting water on] Shabbos.</p>
<p class="bas indent1"><span class="nm">(h)</span><span class="cl">Rejection (Beraisa):</span> One may put a Kli under a Ner to catch sparks on Shabbos, there is no need to say that one may do so from before Shabbos;</p>
<p class="bas indent2"><span class="nm">1.</span>One may not put water in the Kli [from before Shabbos], there is no need to say that this is forbidden on Shabbos.</p>
<p class="bas indent1"><span class="nm">(i)</span><span class="cl">Conclusion (Rav Ashi):</span> Our Mishnah is even like Chachamim [who permit causing to extinguish] - here it is forbidden, lest one [directly] make a spark extinguish earlier (put in water or lift the Kli with water when a spark is falling; we forbid Erev Shabbos on account of Shabbos).</p>
<p class="perekline">PEREK BA'MEH TOMNIN</p>
<p class="bas subject"><span class="nm">4)</span>IN WHAT IS <i>HATMANAH</i> PERMITTED?</p>
<p class="bas indent1"><span class="nm">(a)</span><span class="cl">(Mishnah) Question:</span> In what may one do Hatmanah (wrap things to keep them warm), in what is it forbidden [because it adds heat - this is a decree on account of Hatmanah in hot coals]?</p>
<p class="bas indent1"><span class="nm">(b)</span><span class="cl">Answer - part 1:</span> Hatmanah is forbidden in the following, whether they are moist or dry</p>
<p class="bas indent2"><span class="nm">1.</span>Gefes (waste of olives or sesame after the oil was extracted), manure, salt, plaster, and sand;</p>
<p class="bas indent2"><span class="nm">2.</span>Hatmanah in the following is permitted if they are dry and forbidden if they are moist - straw, grape skins or pits, tufts, and grass.</p>
<p class="bas indent1"><span class="nm">(c)</span><span class="cl">(Gemara) Question:</span> Does the Mishnah refer to Gefes of olives, but that of sesame is permitted (it does not give as much heat);</p>
<p class="bas indent2"><span class="nm">1.</span>Or does it refer to Gefes of sesame, all the more so Gefes of olives is prohibited?</p>
<p class="bas indent1"><span class="nm">(d)</span><span class="cl">Answer:</span> R. Zeira taught, if Hatmanah was done in a pot, one may not leave it on Gefes of olives.</p>
<p class="bas indent2"><span class="nm">1.</span>This shows that the Mishnah refers to Gefes of olives.</p>
<p class="bas indent1"><span class="nm">(e)</span><span class="cl">Rejection:</span> No - perhaps Hatmanah <i>in</i> Gefes of sesame is forbidden, but one may leave a pot Tamun in something else on top of sesame, for its meager heat will not reach the pot.</p>
