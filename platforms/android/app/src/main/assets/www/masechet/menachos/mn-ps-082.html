<div class="subject"><span class="nm">1)</span><p>MAY LACHMEI TODAH BE BROUGHT FROM MA'ASER SHENI</p></div>
<div class="indent1"><span class="nm">(a)</span><p><span class="cl">R. Yirmeyah (to R. Zeira):</span> I will explain both of our opinions:</p></div>
<div class="indent2"><span class="nm">1.</span><p>You hold that we learn Todah from Shelamim (that it may come from Ma'aser; Rashi - that it may not come from Ma'aser wheat), which is learned from a Gezerah Shavah "Sham-Sham" from Ma'aser (Sheni);</p></div>
<div class="indent3"><span class="nm">i.</span><p>Just like Shelamim is not itself Ma'aser, also Todah, but wheat bought from Ma'aser money may be used.</p></div>
<div class="indent2"><span class="nm">2.</span><p>I agree that Todah is learned from Shelamim, which is learned from Ma'aser;</p></div>
<div class="indent3"><span class="nm">i.</span><p>(However, I say) just like Shelamim does not come from a species subject to Ma'aser, also Todah (and its bread, i.e. one may not use wheat bought from Ma'aser money. Loaves bought from Ma'aser (Rashi Kesav Yad - l'Shem Todah) may be used. They are not considered a species subject to Ma'aser.)</p></div>
<div class="subject"><span class="nm">2)</span><p>GIVING KEDUSHAS SHELAMIM TO MA'ASER SHENI</p></div>
<div class="indent1"><span class="nm">(a)</span><p><span class="cl">(R. Ami):</span> If one is Matfis Ma'aser Sheni for Shelamim (is Makdish it with Kedushas Shelamim), it does not take effect.</p></div>
<div class="indent1"><span class="nm">(b)</span><p><span class="cl">Question:</span> What is the reason?</p></div>
<div class="indent1"><span class="nm">(c)</span><p><span class="cl">Answer:</span> Kedushas Shelamim is not strong enough to be Chal (take effect) on Kedushas Ma'aser.</p></div>
<div class="indent1"><span class="nm">(d)</span><p><span class="cl">Question (Mishnah):</span> If one used Ma'aser money to buy a Chayah for a Shelamim, or a Behemah to eat like Chulin, (this is improper, therefore) the skin does not become Chulin.</p></div>
<div class="indent2"><span class="nm">1.</span><p><span class="cl">Inference:</span> The skin receives Kedushas Shelamim!</p></div>
<div class="indent1"><span class="nm">(e)</span><p><span class="cl">Answer:</span> No, it means, the animal is not Nitfas (bi'Kdushas Shelamim) in a way that would cause the skin to become Chulin (like it does when one buys a Behemah for Shelamim or a Chayah for Chulin, even though it was bought with Ma'aser money and the skin will not be eaten. Rashi - alternatively, the animal is not Nitfas bi'Kdushas Shelamim, so it is inapplicable to discuss the skin becoming Chulin.)</p></div>
<div class="indent1"><span class="nm">(f)</span><p><span class="cl">Question:</span> What is the reason?</p></div>
<div class="indent1"><span class="nm">(g)</span><p><span class="cl">Answer (Rabah):</span> This is like buying an ox for plowing (Kedushas Ma'aser transfers to the entire ox. It must be sold to buy food to eat bi'Kedushas Ma'aser.)</p></div>
<div class="indent1"><span class="nm">(h)</span><p><span class="cl">(R. Yochanan):</span> If one is Matfis Ma'aser Sheni for Shelamim, it takes effect;</p></div>
<div class="indent1"><span class="nm">(i)</span><p><span class="cl">(R. Elazar):</span> It does not take effect.</p></div>
<div class="indent1"><span class="nm">(j)</span><p>According to R. Yehudah, who says that one owns his Ma'aser Sheni (it is Chulin, just there are restrictions), all agree that Kedushas Shelamim is strong enough to be Chal;</p></div>
<div class="indent2"><span class="nm">1.</span><p>They argue according to R. Meir, who says that Ma'aser Sheni is Kodesh. (One does not own it, he just has permission to eat it);</p></div>
<div class="indent2"><span class="nm">2.</span><p>Clearly, R. Elazar holds like R. Meir;</p></div>
<div class="indent2"><span class="nm">3.</span><p>Even R. Yochanan's law can be like R. Meir;</p></div>
<div class="indent3"><span class="nm">i.</span><p><span class="cl">Version #1 (our text, Rashi Kesav Yad):</span> Ma'aser is called Shelamim (it says "v'Achalta Sham (Shelamim)." A Gezerah Shavah teaches that this refers to an animal bought with Ma'aser.)</p></div>
<div class="indent3"><span class="nm">ii.</span><p><span class="cl">Version #2 (Rashi):</span> Since Ma'aser can be (used to buy an animal to be) offered like Shelamim, it is Nitfas.</p></div>
<div class="indent1"><span class="nm">(k)</span><p><span class="cl">Question (against R. Elazar - Beraisa):</span> If one is Matfis Ma'aser Sheni for Shelamim, when he redeems it, he must add two fifths, one for Hekdesh (it gets Kedushas Shelamim), and one for Ma'aser.</p></div>
<div class="indent1"><span class="nm">(l)</span><p><span class="cl">Answer:</span> This is like R. Yehudah.</p></div>
<div class="subject"><span class="nm">3)</span><p>CHOVOS MUST BE BROUGHT FROM CHULIN</p></div>
<div class="indent1"><span class="nm">(a)</span><p><span class="cl">(Mishnah) Question:</span> What is the source that if one said 'Alai Todah', he must bring it from Chulin?</p></div>
<div class="indent1"><span class="nm">(b)</span><p><span class="cl">Answer:</span> It says "v'Zavachta Pesach... Tzon u'Vakar";</p></div>
<div class="indent2"><span class="nm">1.</span><p><span class="cl">Objection:</span> Pesach is not brought from cattle, only from flock (sheep or goats)!</p></div>
<div class="indent2"><span class="nm">2.</span><p><span class="cl">Answer:</span> This is extra, to equate (all other) Korbanos, which are brought from flock or cattle, to Pesach:</p></div>
<div class="indent3"><span class="nm">i.</span><p>Just like Pesach is a Chovah (obligation), and it is brought only from Chulin, also all Chovos.</p></div>
<div class="indent1"><span class="nm">(c)</span><p>Therefore, if one said 'Alai Todah' or 'Alai Shelamim', now he is obligated to bring it, so he must bring it from Chulin.</p></div>
<div class="indent1"><span class="nm">(d)</span><p>In every case, Nesachim must be from Chulin. (Ma'aser cannot be used, for people do not eat them.)</p></div>
<div class="indent1"><span class="nm">(e)</span><p><span class="cl">(Gemara) Question:</span> What is the source that one must bring Pesach from Chulin?</p></div>
<div class="indent1"><span class="nm">(f)</span><p><span class="cl">Answer #1 (Beraisa - R. Eliezer):</span> We learn Pesach Doros (i.e. after entering Eretz Yisrael) from the Pesach offered in Mitzrayim;</p></div>
<div class="indent2"><span class="nm">1.</span><p>Just like Pesach Mitzrayim was from Chulin (there was no Ma'aser (Rashi; Rambam - Hekdesh) at the time), also Pesach Doros.</p></div>
<div class="indent2"><span class="nm">2.</span><p><span class="cl">R. Akiva:</span> We cannot learn something possible (Pesach Doros, which (conceivably) could be brought from Ma'aser) from something impossible!</p></div>
<div class="indent2"><span class="nm">3.</span><p><span class="cl">R. Eliezer:</span> Indeed, we can learn possible from impossible.</p></div>
<div class="indent2"><span class="nm">4.</span><p><span class="cl">R. Akiva:</span> Blood and Eimurim of Pesach Doros must be offered on the Mizbe'ach. We cannot learn it from Pesach Mitzrayim, which was brought without a Mizbe'ach!</p></div>
<div class="bbbline">82b----------------------------------------82b</p></div>
<div class="indent2"><span class="nm">5.</span><p><span class="cl">R. Eliezer:</span> "Va'Avadta Es ha'Avodah ha'Zos ba'Chodesh ha'Zeh" - all Avodah of this month is the same. (Pesach Doros is like Pesach Mitzrayim.)</p></div>
<div class="indent1"><span class="nm">(g)</span><p><span class="cl">Question:</span> If R. Akiva maintains that we cannot learn possible from impossible, his first objection suffices;</p></div>
<div class="indent2"><span class="nm">1.</span><p>If he retracted, and does not learn from Pesach Mitzrayim because there was no (Hakravah on a) Mizbe'ach, he should learn from Pesach brought in the Midbar. (There was a Mizbe'ach, yet it was brought from Chulin, for there was no Ma'aser!)</p></div>
<div class="indent1"><span class="nm">(h)</span><p><span class="cl">Answer:</span> He asks according to R. Eliezer's opinion;</p></div>
<div class="indent2"><span class="nm">1.</span><p>I hold that we cannot learn possible from impossible;</p></div>
<div class="indent2"><span class="nm">2.</span><p>You learn possible from impossible. Even so, you cannot learn from Pesach Mitzrayim because there was no Mizbe'ach! (Rashba - R. Akiva assumed that R. Eliezer learned specifically from Pesach Mitzrayim. For some reason, he could not learn from Pesach Midbar.)</p></div>
<div class="indent2"><span class="nm">3.</span><p>R. Eliezer answered that the Hekesh "va'Avadta" overcomes this objection.</p></div>
<div class="indent1"><span class="nm">(i)</span><p><span class="cl">Question:</span> Why didn't he answer that we learn from Pesach Midbar?</p></div>
<div class="indent1"><span class="nm">(j)</span><p><span class="cl">Answer:</span> He answered according to R. Akiva's opinion:</p></div>
<div class="indent2"><span class="nm">1.</span><p>According to me, we learn possible from impossible. Pesach Midbar answers your objection;</p></div>
<div class="indent2"><span class="nm">2.</span><p>You do not learn possible from impossible. Even so, you should learn from Pesach Mitzrayim due to "va'Avadta"!</p></div>
<div class="indent1"><span class="nm">(k)</span><p><span class="cl">Question:</span> Still, this is possible from impossible! (Why should R. Akiva agree to this?)</p></div>
<div class="indent1"><span class="nm">(l)</span><p><span class="cl">Answer (Rav Sheshes):</span> We learn from this that we do not challenge a Hekesh (even if it contradicts normal laws of expounding (Tosfos - if there is nothing else to learn from it)).</p></div>
<div class="indent1"><span class="nm">(m)</span><p><span class="cl">Question (Rabanan of the Beis Medrash):</span> How can Pesach Doros, which was learned from a Hekesh, teach about other Korbanos through a Hekesh?</p></div>
<div class="indent1"><span class="nm">(n)</span><p><span class="cl">Answer:</span> "Va'Avadta" is not a Hekesh. Rather, it teaches that all Pesachim are one matter. They have one law.</p></div>
<div class="subject"><span class="nm">4)</span><p>KODSHEI KODOSHIM ARE COMPARED TO EACH OTHER</p></div>
<div class="indent1"><span class="nm">(a)</span><p><span class="cl">Question:</span> What is R. Akiva's source that Pesach must come from Chulin?</p></div>
<div class="indent1"><span class="nm">(b)</span><p>(The answer to this question is on Daf 83a. He expounds a verse. The Gemara first explains how R. Eliezer expounds the verse.)</p></div>
<div class="indent1"><span class="nm">(c)</span><p><span class="cl">(Shmuel citing R. Eliezer):</span> "Zos ha'Torah la'Olah la'Minchah vela'Chatas vela'Asham vela'Milu'im ul'Zevach ha'Shelamim" teaches that just like Olah requires a Kli, all these Korbanos require a Kli. (This verse teaches about all Korbanos, even Ofos - Tosfos above, 2a.)</p></div>
<div class="indent2"><span class="nm">1.</span><p><span class="cl">Question:</span> Which Kli do we learn from this?</p></div>
<div class="indent3"><span class="nm">i.</span><p><span class="cl">Suggestion:</span> We learn that a Kli is needed for Kabalas Dam (like it says about the Olos offered before Matan Torah, "va'Yasem ba'Aganos").</p></div>
<div class="indent3"><span class="nm">ii.</span><p><span class="cl">Rejection:</span> That verse applies also to the Shalmei Tzibur offered then! (R. Eliezer should have said that we learn from Olah and Shelamim.)</p></div>
<div class="indent2"><span class="nm">2.</span><p><span class="cl">Answer:</span> Rather, we learn that a knife is needed for Shechitah.</p></div>
<div class="indent2"><span class="nm">3.</span><p><span class="cl">Question:</span> What is the source that Olah requires a knife for Shechitah?</p></div>
<div class="indent2"><span class="nm">4.</span><p><span class="cl">Answer:</span> We learn from "va'Yishlach Avraham Es Yado va'Yikach Es ha'Ma'acheles Lishchot Es Beno."</p></div>
<div class="indent3"><span class="nm">i.</span><p>"Va'Ya'alehu l'Olah Tachas Beno" - since the ram was an Olah in place of Yitzchak, it follows that also he was an Olah. (Sefas Emes asks why we do not learn from Hash-m's initial command to offer Yitzchak for an Olah.)</p></div>
