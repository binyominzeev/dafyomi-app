<p class="bas subject"><span class="nm">1)</span>IN YEHUDAH, AN <i>AM HA'ARETZ</i> IS TRUSTED</p>
<p class="bas indent1"><span class="nm">(a)</span><span class="cl">Question:</span> Why is he trusted only in Yehudah, and not in Galil?</p>
<p class="bas indent1"><span class="nm">(b)</span><span class="cl">Answer:</span> Not even a Chaver is trusted from Galil, because there is a strip of foreign land separating Galil from Yehudah.</p>
<p class="bas indent2"><span class="nm">1.</span>The Chachamim decreed Tum'ah on foreign land.</p>
<p class="bas indent2"><span class="nm">2.</span><span class="cl">Question:</span> Let them bring the wine and oil in a closed chest carried above the ground?</p>
<p class="bas indent2"><span class="nm">3.</span><span class="cl">Answer:</span> The Mishnah is the view of Rebbi, who maintains that such an airborne enclosure does not separate from Tum'ah.</p>
<p class="bas indent2"><span class="nm">4.</span><span class="cl">Question:</span> Let them bring it in a tightly sealed vessel?</p>
<p class="bas indent2"><span class="nm">5.</span><span class="cl">Answer:</span> A tightly sealed vessel does not protect Kodesh from Tum'ah.</p>
<p class="bas indent2"><span class="nm">6.</span><span class="cl">Question:</span> But did not Ula say that the Chaverim in Galil are Metaher their wine and oil for the Mizbe'ach?</p>
<p class="bas indent2"><span class="nm">7.</span><span class="cl">Answer:</span> Leave them, for when Eliyahu comes, perhaps he will be Metaher them (by revealing that there is a path of Jewish land through the strip of foreign land).</p>
<p class="bas subject"><span class="nm">2)</span>FOR <i>TERUMAH</i>, AN <i>AM HA'ARETZ</i> IS TRUSTED ON THE <i>TAHARAH</i> OF WINE AND OIL ONLY DURING THEIR PRODUCTION SEASONS</p>
<p class="bas indent1"><span class="nm">(a)</span><span class="cl">Question:</span> A Beraisa says that an Am ha'Aretz is <i>not</i> trusted on the Taharah of his oil during its production season!</p>
<p class="bas indent2"><span class="nm">1.</span><span class="cl">(Beraisa):</span> One who completes the production of his olives must leave one basket (not processed into oil) and show it to the Kohen (so that the Kohen sees that it did not become fit to be Mekabel Tum'ah).</p>
<p class="bas indent1"><span class="nm">(b)</span><span class="cl">Answer #1 (R. Nachman):</span> The Beraisa is referring to late olives, which ripened after the production season had passed.</p>
<p class="bas indent1"><span class="nm">(c)</span><span class="cl">Answer #2 (R. Yosef):</span> The Beraisa is referring to olives brought from Galil, and that is why the Am ha'Aretz is not trusted.</p>
<p class="bas indent1"><span class="nm">(d)</span><span class="cl">Refutation (Abaye):</span> Another Beraisa states clearly that Trans- jordan and Galil have the same status as Yehudah, and Amei ha'Aretz are trusted on the Taharah of their wine and oil during the production seasons!</p>
<p class="bas indent1"><span class="nm">(e)</span>Rather, R. Nachman's answer is the correct answer.</p>
<p class="bas subject"><span class="nm">3)</span>THE KOHEN MAY NOT ACCEPT BARRELS OF <i>TERUMAH</i> WINE OR OIL THAT WERE BROUGHT BY <i>AM HA'ARETZ</i> AFTER THE PRODUCTION SEASONS HAD PASSED</p>
<p class="bas indent1"><span class="nm">(a)</span><span class="cl">Question:</span> If the Kohen transgressed and accepted the wine or oil from the Am ha'Aretz, may the Kohen leave it until the next season and then use it?</p>
<p class="bas bbbline">25b----------------------------------------25b</p>
<p class="bas indent1"><span class="nm">(b)</span><span class="cl">Answer:</span> The Mishnah (Demai 6:9) teaches that a Kohen who is a Chaver must destroy the Terumah items that he inherited from his father who was an Am ha'Aretz.</p>
<p class="bas indent2"><span class="nm">1.</span>This implies that he may not leave them until the next season, nor until the festival, when the Terumah items of Amei ha'Aretz are considered Tahor.</p>
<p class="bas indent1"><span class="nm">(c)</span><span class="cl">Refutation:</span> That Mishnah is referring to items that have no production season (but are produced throughout the year), and to items that will not last until the festival, and thus cannot be left until then (but perhaps in our case, the Kohen may leave the wine or oil until the next season).</p>
<p class="bas subject"><span class="nm">4)</span>IF THE <i>AM HA'ARETZ</i> SAYS THAT HE DESIGNATED SOME WINE IN THE BARREL FOR <i>KODESH</i>, HE IS TRUSTED EVEN FOR THE <i>TERUMAH</i></p>
<p class="bas indent1"><span class="nm">(a)</span><span class="cl">(Mishnah, Ohalos 18:4):</span> Beis Shamai and Beis Hillel agree that a Beis ha'Pras may be checked for the sake of bringing the Korban Pesach, but not for the sake of eating Terumah.</p>
<p class="bas indent2"><span class="nm">1.</span><span class="cl">(Shmuel):</span> This means that one may walk through a Beis ha'Pras by blowing the ground in front of him (to move away any remains of a corpse so that he not become Tamei by inadvertently carrying it with is foot).</p>
<p class="bas indent2"><span class="nm">2.</span><span class="cl">(Ula):</span> This means that one checks to see if the Beis ha'Pras was trampled by other people, and if so he may go through it.</p>
<p class="bas indent2"><span class="nm">3.</span>The reason is because the Chachamim did not enforce their enactment (that a Beis ha'Pras is Tamei) in the place of Kares (permitting those who need to bring the Korban Pesach to go through a Beis ha'Pras without becoming Tamei).</p>
<p class="bas indent2"><span class="nm">4.</span>And they did enforce it in the place of Misah (making those people who eat Terumah become Tamei when they pass through a Beis ha'Pras, in order to prevent them from being Chayav Misah if they actually carried a bone).</p>
<p class="bas indent1"><span class="nm">(b)</span><span class="cl">Question:</span> If the Beis ha'Pras was checked by someone going to offer the Korban Pesach, may he also eat Terumah after walking through it?</p>
<p class="bas indent1"><span class="nm">(c)</span><span class="cl">Answer #1 (Ula):</span> It is permitted.</p>
<p class="bas indent1"><span class="nm">(d)</span><span class="cl">Answer #2 (Rabah bar Ula):</span> It is prohibited.</p>
<p class="bas indent1"><span class="nm">(e)</span><span class="cl">(Refutation):</span> Do not argue with Ula, for our Mishnah supports him.</p>
<p class="bas indent2"><span class="nm">1.</span>The Mishnah says that since the Am ha'Aretz is trusted regarding the Taharah of the Kodesh mixed in the barrel, he is also trusted with regard to the Terumah.</p>
<p class="bas indent2"><span class="nm">2.</span>Likewise, since one who walks through a Beis ha'Pras is Tahor for the Korban Pesach, he is also Tahor for Terumah.</p>
<p class="bas subject"><span class="nm">5)</span>JUGS OF WINE AND OIL OF AN <i>AM HA'ARETZ</i></p>
<p class="bas indent1"><span class="nm">(a)</span><span class="cl">(Beraisa):</span> Amei ha'Aretz are not trusted on the Taharah of jugs, nor on Terumah.</p>
<p class="bas indent1"><span class="nm">(b)</span><span class="cl">Question:</span> What sort of jugs?</p>
<p class="bas indent2"><span class="nm">1.</span>If they are jugs of Kodesh, then since the Am ha'Aretz is trusted on the Taharah of the Kodesh, he should also be trusted on the jugs ("Migu")!</p>
<p class="bas indent2"><span class="nm">2.</span>But if they are jugs of Terumah, then it is obvious that they are not trusted!</p>
<p class="bas indent2"><span class="nm">3.</span>Rather, the jugs are those used for Kodesh which are presently empty (since there is no longer any Kodesh in them, the Am ha'Aretz does not guard them from becoming Tamei).</p>
<p class="bas indent2"><span class="nm">4.</span>It also refers to jugs used for Terumah, which are presently full, during the production season (the Am ha'Aretz is trusted regarding the Taharah of the Terumah, but not of the jugs containing the Terumah).</p>
<p class="bas indent1"><span class="nm">(c)</span><span class="cl">Question:</span> How can the Beraisa refer to jugs of Terumah that presently contain Terumah, and say that the Am ha'Aretz is not trusted?</p>
<p class="bas indent2"><span class="nm">1.</span>The Mishnah states that the Am ha'Aretz <i>is</i> trusted!</p>
<p class="bas indent2"><span class="nm">2.</span><span class="cl">(Mishnah):</span> [An Am ha'Aretz is trusted on the Taharah of his] jugs of wine and oil that are Demai.</p>
<p class="bas indent2"><span class="nm">3.</span>This presumably means Demai of Terumah (Terumah and Chulin mixed together)!</p>
<p class="bas indent1"><span class="nm">(d)</span><span class="cl">Answer:</span> The Mishnah means Demai of Kodesh (but if it is Demai of Terumah, the Am ha'Aretz is <i>not</i> believed, as the Beraisa says.)</p>
<p class="bas indent2"><span class="nm">1.</span>Demai of Kodesh means that he designated some of the wine in the jug to be Kodesh, and it is mixed with the rest of the wine which is Terumah and Chulin. (Since he is trusted for the Kodesh, he is also trusted for the Terumah and the jugs.)</p>
<p class="bas subject"><span class="nm">6)</span>SEVENTY DAYS BEFORE THE PRODUCTION SEASONS</p>
<p class="bas indent1"><span class="nm">(a)</span><span class="cl">(Abaye):</span> From here we learn a Halachah: the worker goes up to deal with preparing the jugs seventy days before the winepress.</p>
<p class="bas subject"><span class="nm">7)</span><i>MISHNAH</i>: BUYING <i>TAHOR</i> VESSELS FROM AN <i>AM HA'ARETZ</i></p>
<p class="bas indent1"><span class="nm">(a)</span>From Modi'im and inward (toward Yerushalayim), they are trusted on the Taharah of earthenware vessels.</p>
<p class="bas indent1"><span class="nm">(b)</span>From Modi'im and outward, they are not trusted.</p>
<p class="bas indent1"><span class="nm">(c)</span>Only the potter who comes within Modi'im selling only the pots that he himself brought, is trusted, and only for the person who buys the pots directly from him.</p>
<p class="bas indent1"><span class="nm">(d)</span>If the potter went outside of Modi'im, he is no longer trusted.</p>
