<div class="indent1"><span class="nm">(a)</span><p>A case occurred in which R. Ami permitted Bi'ah Rishonah on Shabbos.</p></div>
<div class="indent1"><span class="nm">(b)</span><p><span class="cl">Question (Rabanan):</span> A Kesuvah was not written!</p></div>
<div class="indent1"><span class="nm">(c)</span><p><span class="cl">Answer (R. Ami):</span> She should seize movable objects (for a security until he writes a Kesuvah).</p></div>
<div class="indent1"><span class="nm">(d)</span><p><span class="cl">Version #1:</span> Rav Zvid permitted Bi'ah Rishonah on Shabbos.</p></div>
<div class="indent1"><span class="nm">(e)</span><p><span class="cl">Version #2:</span> Rav Zvid himself had Bi'ah Rishonah on Shabbos.</p></div>
<div class="indent1"><span class="nm">(f)</span><p>Rav Yehudah permitted Bi'ah Rishonah on Yom Tov.</p></div>
<div class="indent1"><span class="nm">(g)</span><p><span class="cl">(Rav Papi):</span> He permits even on Shabbos. The case he ruled about just happened to be on Yom Tov.</p></div>
<div class="indent1"><span class="nm">(h)</span><p><span class="cl">(Rav Papa):</span> He permits only Yom Tov, but not Shabbos.</p></div>
<div class="indent1"><span class="nm">(i)</span><p><span class="cl">Question (Rav Papi):</span> Do you hold that mi'Toch (since) wounding is permitted when needed (for food, i.e. Shechitah), it is also permitted when not needed?</p></div>
<div class="indent2"><span class="nm">1.</span><p>If so, it should be permitted to burn incense on Yom Tov! (Since one may burn for the needs of food, it should be allowed even when not needed!)</p></div>
<div class="indent1"><span class="nm">(j)</span><p><span class="cl">Answer (Rav Papa):</span> "What every person will eat" - the Torah allows only what is common to all (most) people.</p></div>
<div class="indent1"><span class="nm">(k)</span><p><span class="cl">Question (Rav Acha brei d'Rava):</span> If so, one may not slaughter a deer on Yom Tov, since not all people eat deer!</p></div>
<div class="indent1"><span class="nm">(l)</span><p><span class="cl">Answer (Rav Ashi):</span> Anything that all people enjoy is allowed. All enjoy deer (just not everyone can afford it).</p></div>
<div class="indent1"><span class="nm">(m)</span><p><span class="cl">(Rav Yakov bar Idi):</span> R. Yochanan was Moreh (ruled) that one may not have Bi'ah Rishonah on Shabbos.</p></div>
<div class="indent1"><span class="nm">(n)</span><p><span class="cl">Question:</span> Is <i>Hora'ah</i> an appropriate term for an Isur?</p></div>
<div class="indent1"><span class="nm">(o)</span><p><span class="cl">Answer:</span> Yes! A Mishnah says that Beis Hillel were Moreh (to Hilni ha'Malkah) to observe seven more years of Nezirus.</p></div>
<div class="indent2"><span class="nm">1.</span><p><span class="cl">(Beraisa - Rebbi):</span> If the majority of the spinal cord was cut (the animal is Tereifah);</p></div>
<div class="indent2"><span class="nm">2.</span><p>R. Yakov says, even if it is punctured it is Tereifah.</p></div>
<div class="indent2"><span class="nm">3.</span><p>Rebbi was Moreh like R. Yakov.</p></div>
<div class="indent2"><span class="nm">4.</span><p><span class="cl">(Rav Huna):</span> The Halachah does not follow R. Yakov.</p></div>
<div class="indent1"><span class="nm">(p)</span><p><span class="cl">(Rav Nachman bar Yitzchak):</span> R. Yochanan forbade Bi'ah Rishonah on Shabbos.</p></div>

<div class="subject"><span class="nm">2)</span><p>THE DAYS OF BIRKAS CHASANIM</p></div>
<div class="indent1"><span class="nm">(a)</span><p><span class="cl">(Rav Huna):</span> Both a virgin and a widow require a Berachah.</p></div>
<div class="indent1"><span class="nm">(b)</span><p><span class="cl">Contradiction:</span> Rav Huna said that a widow does not require a Berachah!</p></div>
<div class="indent1"><span class="nm">(c)</span><p><span class="cl">Answer:</span> For a Bachur (one who was not married before), we must bless, but not for a widower who marries a widow.</p></div>
<div class="indent1"><span class="nm">(d)</span><p><span class="cl">Objection:</span> A Beraisa learns from Boaz and Rus, a widower and a widow, that we need 10 men for Birkas Chasanim!</p></div>
<div class="indent1"><span class="nm">(e)</span><p><span class="cl">Answer:</span> Rav Huna meant that a widow does not need seven days of Berachah; one day is required.</p></div>
<div class="indent1"><span class="nm">(f)</span><p><span class="cl">Question (Beraisa):</span> Chachamim deliberated how to help Benos Yisrael, so a Chasan will rejoice three days (with a widow).</p></div>
<div class="indent2"><span class="nm">1.</span><p>If he is a Bachur, seven days are required. If he is a widower, only one is required!</p></div>
<div class="indent1"><span class="nm">(g)</span><p><span class="cl">Answer #1:</span> A widower requires one day of Berachah and three days of Simchah;</p></div>
<div class="indent1"><span class="nm">(h)</span><p><span class="cl">Answer #2:</span> A Bachur requires seven days of Berachah and three days of Simchah.</p></div>

<div class="indent1"><span class="nm">(i)</span><p><span class="cl">Question (Beraisa):</span> We bless seven days for a virgin, and one day for a widow.</p></div>
<div class="indent2"><span class="nm">1.</span><p><span class="cl">Assumption:</span> This applies even to a Bachur who married a widow!</p></div>
<div class="indent1"><span class="nm">(j)</span><p><span class="cl">Answer:</span> No, it applies only to a widower.</p></div>
<div class="indent1"><span class="nm">(k)</span><p><span class="cl">Question:</span> If you hold that for a Bachur we bless seven days, it should say that we bless seven days for a virgin or for a Bachur who married a widow, and one day for a widow (who marries a widower)!</p></div>
<div class="indent1"><span class="nm">(l)</span><p><span class="cl">Answer:</span> The Tana taught a clear-cut law, that every virgin has seven days of Berachah, and every widow has no less than one.</p></div>
<div class="subject"><span class="nm">3)</span><p>A MINYAN IS NEEDED FOR BIRKAS CHASANIM</p></div>
<div class="indent1"><span class="nm">(a)</span><p><span class="cl">Question (Rav Nachman):</span> What is the source that we need 10 for Birkas Chasanim?</p></div>
<div class="indent1"><span class="nm">(b)</span><p><span class="cl">Answer #1 (Rav Nachman):</span> We learn from "He (Boaz) took 10 elders".</p></div>
<div class="indent1"><span class="nm">(c)</span><p><span class="cl">Answer #2 (R. Avahu):</span> We learn from "In the congregations bless Hash-m from the source of Yisrael".</p></div>
<div class="indent2"><span class="nm">1.</span><p>Rav Nachman uses this latter verse to teach that even fetuses sang at the splitting of the Red Sea.</p></div>
<div class="indent2"><span class="nm">2.</span><p>R. Avahu disagrees, for if so, the verse should have said 'from the womb'.</p></div>
<div class="indent1"><span class="nm">(d)</span><p>R. Avahu learns from the former verse that Boaz assembled 10 to teach that the Torah forbids male converts from Amon and Mo'av to marry Yisraelim, but permits female converts;</p></div>
<div class="indent2"><span class="nm">1.</span><p>He holds that if 10 were for a Berachah, elders would not be required.</p></div>
<div class="indent1"><span class="nm">(e)</span><p><span class="cl">Question (Rav Nachman):</span> If he gathered them to expound, he would not need 10!</p></div>
<div class="indent1"><span class="nm">(f)</span><p><span class="cl">Answer:</span> He needed 10 to publicize the law;</p></div>
<div class="indent2"><span class="nm">1.</span><p>Shmuel gathered 10 people to teach that if one acquires on behalf of a fetus, the acquisition is valid.</p></div>
<div class="indent2"><span class="nm">2.</span><p>The Halachah does not follow Shmuel.</p></div>
<div class="subject"><span class="nm">4)</span><p>WHERE WE MAKE THE BERACHOS OF CHASANIM AND KIDUSHIN</p></div>
<div class="indent1"><span class="nm">(a)</span><p><span class="cl">(Beraisa):</span> We make Birkas Chasanim at the time of Chupah;</p></div>
<div class="indent1"><span class="nm">(b)</span><p>R. Yehudah says, we make it even at the time of Kidushin.</p></div>
<div class="indent1"><span class="nm">(c)</span><p><span class="cl">(Abaye):</span> This applies in Yehudah, where the Chasan and Kalah are secluded (during Eirusin (engagement).</p></div>
<div class="indent1"><span class="nm">(d)</span><p><span class="cl">(Beraisa):</span> We make Birkas Chasanim at the Chupah, and the Berachah of Kidushin at the Kidushin.</p></div>
<div class="indent1"><span class="nm">(e)</span><p><span class="cl">Question:</span> What is the Berachah of Kidushin?</p></div>
<div class="indent1"><span class="nm">(f)</span><p><span class="cl">Answer #1 (Rava bar Rav Ada):</span> It is "... Who commanded us about incest, and forbade to us Arusos (girls during Eirusin), and permitted Nesu'os through Chupah and Kidushin".</p></div>
<div class="indent1"><span class="nm">(g)</span><p><span class="cl">Answer #2 (Rav Acha brei d'Rava):</span> We Chosem (end the Berachah with a Berachah) "Baruch Atah Hash-m, who sanctifies Yisrael through Chupah and Kidushin."</p></div>
<div class="indent2"><span class="nm">1.</span><p>Rava bar Rav Ada says we do not Chosem, just like we do not Chosem the Berachos over foods and Mitzvos.</p></div>
<div class="indent2"><span class="nm">2.</span><p>Rav Acha says that we Chosem, just like we Chosem the Berachah of Kidush.</p></div>
<div class="indent1"><span class="nm">(h)</span><p><span class="cl">(Beraisa):</span> We make Birkas Chasanim all seven days with 10 people.</p></div>
<div class="indent1"><span class="nm">(i)</span><p><span class="cl">(Rav Yehudah):</span> This is when there are new people at the meal.</p></div>
