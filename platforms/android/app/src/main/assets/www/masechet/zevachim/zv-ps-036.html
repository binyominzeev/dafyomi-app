<div class="subject"><span class="nm">1)</span><p>OTHER IMPROPER INTENTS</p></div>
<div class="indent1"><span class="nm">(a)</span><p><span class="cl">(Mishnah - R. Yehudah):</span> If one slaughtered a Korban with intent to leave the blood or Eimurim for the morrow, or to take them outside (the Azarah), it is Pasul;</p></div>
<div class="indent1"><span class="nm">(b)</span><p>Chachamim are Machshir.</p></div>
<div class="indent1"><span class="nm">(c)</span><p>The only intents that disqualify are Chutz li'Zmano, Chutz li'Mkomo, and in a Chatas or Pesach, Lo Lishmah. Therefore, in the following cases, the Korban is Kosher;</p></div>
<div class="indent2"><span class="nm">1.</span><p>He intended to do Zerikah in the wrong part of the Mizbe'ach, i.e. on the ramp, not above the Yesod, to put on top (of the Mizbe'ach) blood that should be put on bottom, or vice-versa, or to put blood that must be put on the outer Mizbe'ach on the inner Mizbe'ach, or vice-versa;</p></div>
<div class="indent2"><span class="nm">2.</span><p>He intended that Teme'im or Arelim will eat it or offer it (e.g. do Zerikah);</p></div>
<div class="indent2"><span class="nm">3.</span><p>He intended to break bones of a Korban Pesach or to eat it raw;</p></div>
<div class="indent2"><span class="nm">4.</span><p>He intended to mix its blood with blood of Pasul Korbanos.</p></div>
<div class="indent1"><span class="nm">(d)</span><p><span class="cl">(Gemara) Question:</span> What is R. Yehudah's reason?</p></div>
<div class="indent1"><span class="nm">(e)</span><p><span class="cl">Answer #1 (R. Elazar):</span> It says "v'Lo Sosiru Mimenu Ad Boker (our text; the verse discusses Korban Pesach. Shitah Mekubetzes - "Lo Sosiru Mimenu" (Vayikra 22:30, regarding Todah; this answers Tosfos' question));</p></div>
<div class="indent2"><span class="nm">1.</span><p>It also says (regarding Todah) "Lo Yani'ach Mimenu Ad Boker"</p></div>
<div class="indent2"><span class="nm">2.</span><p>Since we do not need two verses to forbid leaving the meat until morning, one teaches about intent to leave it until morning.</p></div>
<div class="indent1"><span class="nm">(f)</span><p><span class="cl">Question:</span> The verse teaches something else!</p></div>
<div class="indent2"><span class="nm">1.</span><p><span class="cl">(Beraisa):</span> "U'Vesar Zevach Todas Shelamav (... Lo Yani'ach)" teaches that Todah may be eaten (only) one day and one night;</p></div>
<div class="indent2"><span class="nm">2.</span><p><span class="cl">Question:</span> What is the source regarding Chalifav (an animal Hukdash in place of a lost Todah, and then the lost Todah was found), offspring of a Todah, and Temuras Todah?</p></div>
<div class="indent2"><span class="nm">3.</span><p><span class="cl">Answer:</span> "U'Vesar" is extra to include these.</p></div>
<div class="indent2"><span class="nm">4.</span><p><span class="cl">Question:</span> What is the source for Chatas and Asham?</p></div>
<div class="indent2"><span class="nm">5.</span><p><span class="cl">Answer:</span> "Zevach" teaches these.</p></div>
<div class="indent2"><span class="nm">6.</span><p><span class="cl">Question:</span> What is the source for the Shelamim of a Nazir or Shalmei Pesach (Rashi - a Shelamim brought on Erev Pesach, for satiation before eating the Pesach; Tosfos - a Pesach that was not offered on Pesach)?</p></div>
<div class="indent2"><span class="nm">7.</span><p><span class="cl">Answer:</span> "Shelamav" teaches these.</p></div>
<div class="indent2"><span class="nm">8.</span><p><span class="cl">Question:</span> What is the source to include the breads brought with a Todah or with Shalmei Nazir?</p></div>
<div class="indent2"><span class="nm">9.</span><p><span class="cl">Answer:</span> "Korbano" includes these;</p></div>
<div class="indent2"><span class="nm">10.</span><p><span class="cl">Summation of question:</span> "Lo Yani'ach" applies to all of these. It cannot teach about intent to leave until morning!</p></div>
<div class="indent1"><span class="nm">(g)</span><p><span class="cl">Answer:</span> It could have said "Lo Sosiru", like the other verse;</p></div>
<div class="indent2"><span class="nm">1.</span><p>Since here it says (differently) "Lo Yani'ach", we expound this to teach also about intent to leave until morning.</p></div>
<div class="indent1"><span class="nm">(h)</span><p><span class="cl">Objection #1:</span> This is a source for intent to leave over. It does not teach about intent to take (the blood or Eimurim) outside!</p></div>
<div class="indent1"><span class="nm">(i)</span><p><span class="cl">Objection #2:</span> R. Yehudah learns from reasoning, and not from a verse!</p></div>
<div class="indent2"><span class="nm">1.</span><p><span class="cl">(Beraisa - R. Yehudah (to Chachamim)):</span> You agree that if he left them until morning, it is Pasul. Likewise, you should agree that intent to leave disqualifies!</p></div>
<div class="indent1"><span class="nm">(j)</span><p><span class="cl">Answer #2:</span> R. Yehudah learns from (the above) reasoning.</p></div>
<div class="indent1"><span class="nm">(k)</span><p><span class="cl">Question:</span> He should argue also about the other cases (intent for Zerikah in the wrong place...)!</p></div>
<div class="indent1"><span class="nm">(l)</span><p><span class="cl">Answer:</span> His reasoning does not apply to any other case!</p></div>
<div class="indent2"><span class="nm">1.</span><p><span class="cl">Question:</span> In which other case should R. Yehudah say that bad intent disqualifies?</p></div>
<div class="indent2"><span class="nm">2.</span><p><span class="cl">Answer #1:</span> He intended to break the bones of a Korban Pesach, or to eat it raw.</p></div>
<div class="indent2"><span class="nm">3.</span><p><span class="cl">Rejection:</span> Even if the intent was carried out, the Korban is Kosher!</p></div>
<div class="indent2"><span class="nm">4.</span><p><span class="cl">Answer #2:</span> He intended that Teme'im or Arelim will eat or offer it.</p></div>
<div class="indent2"><span class="nm">5.</span><p><span class="cl">Version #1 - Rejection:</span> Even if they did, the Korban is Kosher!</p></div>
<div class="indent2"><span class="nm">6.</span><p><span class="cl">Version #2 - Rejection:</span> Surely, they will not agree to transgress, so his intent is meaningless!</p></div>
<div class="indent2"><span class="nm">7.</span><p><span class="cl">Answer #3:</span> He intended to mix its blood with blood of Pasul Korbanos.</p></div>
<div class="indent2"><span class="nm">8.</span><p><span class="cl">Rejection:</span> R. Yehudah holds that blood does not Mevatel blood (so even mixing would not invalidate it)!</p></div>
<div class="indent2"><span class="nm">9.</span><p><span class="cl">Answer #4:</span> He intended to put blood (that should be put above) below, or vice-versa.</p></div>
<div class="indent2"><span class="nm">10.</span><p><span class="cl">Rejection:</span> R. Yehudah holds that this is like putting in the right place (it does not disqualify)!</p></div>
<div class="indent2"><span class="nm">11.</span><p><span class="cl">Answer #5:</span> He intended to put the blood on the wrong Mizbe'ach.</p></div>
<div class="indent2"><span class="nm">12.</span><p><span class="cl">Rejection:</span> R. Yehudah holds that intent disqualifies only if it is for a Meshulash place (Rashi - it is Kosher to offer blood, Eimurim and meat, i.e. outside the Mikdash, when Bamos were permitted; Tosfos - a place where all three of these are disqualified (for this Korban).)</p></div>
<div class="indent2"><span class="nm">13.</span><p><span class="cl">Question:</span> R. Yehudah does not hold like this!</p></div>
<div class="indent3"><span class="nm">i.</span><p><span class="cl">(Beraisa - R. Yehudah):</span> "(Mum Kol) Davar Ra" teaches that if a Chatas was slaughtered in the south, or if its blood was brought into the Heichal (really, it was slaughtered with intent to enter its blood), it is Pasul.</p></div>
<div class="indent3"><span class="nm">ii.</span><p>This shows that R. Yehudah does not require a place that is Meshulash!</p></div>
<div class="indent1"><span class="nm">(m)</span><p><span class="cl">Contradiction (Mishnah - R. Yehudah):</span> If the blood was brought into the Heichal b'Shogeg, it is Kosher;</p></div>
<div class="indent2"><span class="nm">1.</span><p><span class="cl">Inference:</span> If he brought it in b'Mezid, it is Pasul!</p></div>
<div class="indent2"><span class="nm">2.</span><p>We established that this is when he threw it on the inner Mizbe'ach.</p></div>
<div class="indent2"><span class="nm">3.</span><p><span class="cl">Summation of question:</span> R. Yehudah does not disqualify for bringing the blood into the Heichal, unless he did Zerikah. All the more so he does not disqualify for intent to bring it in! (This is unlike the Beraisa.)</p></div>
<div class="indent1"><span class="nm">(n)</span><p><span class="cl">Answer:</span> Tana'im argue about R. Yehudah's opinion.</p></div>
<div class="indent1"><span class="nm">(o)</span><p><span class="cl">Question:</span> The Beraisa said that R. Yehudah disqualifies Kodshei Kodoshim slaughtered in the south. If so, one who does this should be lashed!</p></div>
<div class="bbbline">36b----------------------------------------36b</p></div>
<div class="indent2"><span class="nm">1.</span><p><span class="cl">(Beraisa - R. Yehudah) Suggestion:</span> One who slaughters in the south should be liable!</p></div>

<div class="indent1"><span class="nm">(a)</span><p><span class="cl">(R. Aba):</span> Even though R. Yehudah said that intent to leave over disqualifies, he agrees that if a later Avodah was done with intent Chutz li'Zmano, the Korban is Pigul. (Normally, if there is any other Pesul, the Korban is only Pasul. Here, the other Pesul is the beginning of Pigul!)</p></div>
<div class="indent1"><span class="nm">(b)</span><p><span class="cl">Support (Rava):</span> Pigul (immediately disqualifies a Korban, but Kares) does not apply until Zerikah (when all other stages of Hakravah were finished properly), nevertheless Zerikah makes it Pigul!</p></div>
<div class="indent1"><span class="nm">(c)</span><p><span class="cl">Rejection:</span> We cannot learn from there (where there was only one Pasul intent) to a case of two Pasul intents.</p></div>
<div class="indent1"><span class="nm">(d)</span><p><span class="cl">Question (Rav Huna - Beraisa):</span> If Shechitah or Kabalah was done (by someone Kosher) with intent to put, on the same day, blood that should be put on top on bottom, or vice-versa; it is Kosher;</p></div>
<div class="indent2"><span class="nm">1.</span><p>If in a later Avodah he intended to eat the meat Chutz li'Mkomo, it is Pasul, and there is no Kares;</p></div>
<div class="indent2"><span class="nm">2.</span><p>If he intended Chutz li'Zmano, it is Pigul, and there is Kares.</p></div>
<div class="indent2"><span class="nm">3.</span><p>If Shechitah or Kabalah was done with intent to put <i>the next day</i> blood in the wrong place (top on bottom); it is Pasul;</p></div>
<div class="indent3"><span class="nm">i.</span><p>If in a later Avodah he intended to eat the meat or burn the Eimurim Chutz li'Zmano or Chutz li'Mkomo, it is Pasul, and there is no Kares.</p></div>
<div class="indent1"><span class="nm">(e)</span><p>This refutes R. Aba.</p></div>
<div class="indent1"><span class="nm">(f)</span><p><span class="cl">(Rav Chisda):</span> If one intended for Teme'im to eat it the next day, he is liable.</p></div>
<div class="indent1"><span class="nm">(g)</span><p><span class="cl">Support (Rava):</span> Pigul takes effect before Zerikah, even though the meat is forbidden (until after Zerikah). This shows that Pigul takes effect even though something else forbids the meat!</p></div>

<div class="indent1"><span class="nm">(j)</span><p><span class="cl">Support (Rava - Beraisa):</span> "Asher la'Shem" includes Eimurim of Kodshim Kalim (if a Tamei eats them, he is liable).</p></div>

<div class="indent1"><span class="nm">(k)</span><p><span class="cl">Rejection:</span> No. Eimurim of Kodshim Kalim are Kosher to burn on the Mizbe'ach, therefore a Tamei is liable for them;</p></div>
<div class="indent2"><span class="nm">1.</span><p>Pesach and Lachmei Todah may not be consumed, not by people nor by the Mizbe'ach, before roasting or taking Terumah!</p></div>

<div class="indent1"><span class="nm">(a)</span><p><span class="cl">(Mishnah - Beis Shamai):</span> If the blood of any Korban (whose blood must be put on the outer Mizbe'ach) was put once on the outer Mizbe'ach, Kiper (the Korban is valid), except for Chatas, which must be put twice;</p></div>
<div class="indent1"><span class="nm">(b)</span><p>Beis Hillel say, once suffices even for Chatas.</p></div>
