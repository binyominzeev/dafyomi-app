<div class="subject"><span class="nm">1)</span><p>USING A LOST-AND-FOUND SAIR FOR THE FOLLOWING YEAR (cont'd)</p></div>
<div class="indent1"><span class="nm">(a)</span><p><span class="cl">The as-yet-unanswered Question:</span> Why may the Sa'ir not be used for the following year, rather than pastured or left to die?</p></div>
<div class="indent1"><span class="nm">(b)</span><p><span class="cl">Answer (Rava):</span> We may not re-use the Sa'ir owing to a Gezeirah of Takalah (as taught in the Beraisa).</p></div>
<div class="indent2"><span class="nm">1.</span><p><span class="cl">Answer:</span> Fear that the owner will be Makriv the animals at the improper time.</p></div>
<div class="indent2"><span class="nm">2.</span><p><span class="cl">Question:</span> The same should apply to all Korbanos (none should be put out to pasture)!?</p></div>
<div class="indent2"><span class="nm">3.</span><p><span class="cl">Answer:</span> The Takalah is the concern over accidentally deriving benefit from them.</p></div>
<div class="indent2"><span class="nm">4.</span><p><span class="cl">Question:</span> Again, that should not only apply to the Par and Sa'ir of Yom Kippur!?</p></div>
<div class="indent2"><span class="nm">5.</span><p><span class="cl">Answer:</span> Our concern is that he will offer them improperly, which only applies to animals which, by themselves, <i>are</i> able to be offered, but for the timing.</p></div>
<div class="indent1"><span class="nm">(c)</span><p>The Gezeirah over Takalah is, apparently, a Machlokes in the Beraisos:</p></div>
<div class="indent2"><span class="nm">1.</span><p>One Beraisa allows an animal designated as a Korban Pesach to be brought for Pesach Sheini on the following year, while one Beraisa forbids its subsequent use.</p></div>
<div class="indent2"><span class="nm">2.</span><p>No, the Beraisos argue over how to calculate the year (like Rebbi and Rabanan) and hence if it is possible to use this animal next Pesach.</p></div>
<div class="indent1"><span class="nm">(d)</span><p><span class="cl">Question:</span> But the Beraisos add that the same Din will apply to money designated for a Korban Pesach (which does not have an age limit)?</p></div>
<div class="indent1"><span class="nm">(e)</span><p><span class="cl">Answer:</span> They must, indeed, be arguing about Takalah.</p></div>
<div class="subject"><span class="nm">2)</span><p>THE VIDUI</p></div>
<div class="indent1"><span class="nm">(a)</span><p>The Kohen Gadol's Vidui did not include the transgressions of the Kohanim.</p></div>
<div class="indent1"><span class="nm">(b)</span><p><span class="cl">Question:</span> According to which Tana are the Kohanim omitted?</p></div>
<div class="indent1"><span class="nm">(c)</span><p><span class="cl">Answer (R. Yirmiyah):</span> It is not R. Yehudah who taught (61b) that all, including Kohanim, gain Kaparah through the Sa'ir ha'Mishtale'ach.</p></div>
<div class="indent1"><span class="nm">(d)</span><p><span class="cl">Alternate Answer (Abaye):</span> It could even be R. Yehudah, and the Kohanim are certainly part of 'Your nation, Yisrael!'</p></div>
<div class="subject"><span class="nm">3)</span><p>THE DESIGNATED USHER FOR THE SA'IR</p></div>
<div class="indent1"><span class="nm">(a)</span><p>The Beraisa derives from "Ish" and "Iti" some of the details of this usher.</p></div>
<div class="indent2"><span class="nm">1.</span><p>"Ish" - he may be a Zar</p></div>
<div class="bbbline">66b----------------------------------------66b</p></div>
<div class="indent2"><span class="nm">2.</span><p>"Iti" - he must have been previously designated.</p></div>
<div class="indent2"><span class="nm">3.</span><p>"Iti" - even when Yom Kipur falls on Shabbos.</p></div>
<div class="indent2"><span class="nm">4.</span><p>"Iti" - even if Tamei.</p></div>
<div class="indent1"><span class="nm">(b)</span><p><span class="cl">Question:</span> Why might we have invalidated a Zar?</p></div>
<div class="indent1"><span class="nm">(c)</span><p><span class="cl">Answer:</span> It is an aspect of Kaparah.</p></div>
<div class="indent1"><span class="nm">(d)</span><p><span class="cl">Question:</span> What activity on Shabbos does "Iti" permit?</p></div>
<div class="indent1"><span class="nm">(e)</span><p><span class="cl">Answer:</span> That if the Sa'ir is ill the usher may carry it in Reshus ha'Rabim.</p></div>
<div class="indent1"><span class="nm">(f)</span><p><span class="cl">Question:</span> According to whom is this Din?</p></div>
<div class="indent1"><span class="nm">(g)</span><p><span class="cl">Answer:</span> It is not like R. Noson who holds that carrying a living being is not an Isur Torah (as it 'carries itself').</p></div>
<div class="indent1"><span class="nm">(h)</span><p><span class="cl">Alternate Answer:</span> It could even be the opinion of R. Noson, but being <i>sick</i> may take it out of consideration as 'carrying itself.'</p></div>
<div class="subject"><span class="nm">4)</span><p>HOTZA'AH ON YOM KIPUR</p></div>
<div class="indent1"><span class="nm">(a)</span><p><span class="cl">(Rafram):</span> The Beraisa just cited seems to imply that it is permitted to carry on Yom Kipur, as we need to be taught that it is permitted to carry if Yom Kipur falls on Shabbos.</p></div>
<div class="subject"><span class="nm">5)</span><p>TUM'AH IS PERMITTED BY THE SA'IR HA'MISHTALE'ACH</p></div>
<div class="indent1"><span class="nm">(a)</span><p><span class="cl">Question:</span> How is <i>Tum'ah</i> relevant to the Sa'ir ha'Mishtale'ach?</p></div>
<div class="indent1"><span class="nm">(b)</span><p><span class="cl">Answer (R. Sheishes):</span> If the designated usher becomes Tamei, he enters the Azarah to usher out the Sa'ir.</p></div>
<div class="subject"><span class="nm">6)</span><p>R. ELIEZER'S APPROACH TO THE QUESTIONS</p></div>
<div class="indent1"><span class="nm">(a)</span><p>R. Eliezer was asked if the Sa'ir, if ill, could be carried.</p></div>
<div class="indent1"><span class="nm">(b)</span><p>He avoided the question by asserting that the Sa'ir was healthy and strong.</p></div>
<div class="indent1"><span class="nm">(c)</span><p>He was further asked the Din if the usher becomes ill, might he send it with someone else, and he avoided this question, as well.</p></div>
<div class="indent1"><span class="nm">(d)</span><p>They further asked him for the Din if he pushed the animal off the cliff and it did not die, and, again, he avoided the question by asserting that it surely died.</p></div>
<div class="indent2"><span class="nm">1.</span><p>The Chachamim answered the above three questions.</p></div>
<div class="indent2"><span class="nm">2.</span><p>He may carry it; he may send a substitute; and, he must go down and kill it.</p></div>
<div class="indent1"><span class="nm">(e)</span><p>R. Eliezer was asked if a certain person would merit Olam ha'Ba and he redirected their question onto a different person.</p></div>
<div class="indent1"><span class="nm">(f)</span><p>He was asked if it is permitted for the shepherd to save the sheep from the lion (see Rishonim) and he responded that they might ask if it is permitted to save the shepherd.</p></div>
<div class="indent1"><span class="nm">(g)</span><p>The asked if it is proper to save the shepherd and he responded that perhaps they meant the sheep.</p></div>
<div class="indent1"><span class="nm">(h)</span><p>They asked if a Mamzer inherits, and he responded regarding the Mamzer and Yibum.</p></div>
<div class="indent1"><span class="nm">(i)</span><p>They asked about an unpainted spot (for the Churban) in a Mamzer's house and he responded regarding painting the grave marking of a Mamzer.</p></div>
<div class="indent1"><span class="nm">(j)</span><p>R. Eliezer did these things because he did not wish to say anything that he had not heard from his Rebbi.</p></div>
<div class="indent1"><span class="nm">(k)</span><p>A wise woman asked him why different members of Klal Yisrael received different death penalties for the Eigel, and R. Eliezer redirected her wisdom to the loom.</p></div>
<div class="indent2"><span class="nm">1.</span><p>Rav and Levi disputed the answer to this question:</p></div>
<div class="indent2"><span class="nm">2.</span><p>One opinion was that it varied on the degree of involvement in the transgression (active worship, embracing, private pleasure).</p></div>
<div class="indent2"><span class="nm">3.</span><p>One opinion was that it varied on the level of warning given (warning plus witnesses, witnesses alone, or neither).</p></div>
<div class="subject"><span class="nm">7)</span><p>THE EIGEL</p></div>
<div class="indent1"><span class="nm">(a)</span><p><span class="cl">(R. Yehudah):</span> The tribe of Levi did not worship the Eigel (proof text).</p></div>
<div class="indent1"><span class="nm">(b)</span><p><span class="cl">Question:</span> Ravina recited the above teaching and the sons of R. Papa b. Aba asked how there could have been parents, children and siblings of B'nei Levi who worshipped?</p></div>
<div class="indent1"><span class="nm">(c)</span><p><span class="cl">Answer:</span> They were all non-Levi'im.</p></div>
<div class="indent2"><span class="nm">1.</span><p>Father- his maternal grandfather.</p></div>
<div class="indent2"><span class="nm">2.</span><p>Brother- the son of his mother.</p></div>
<div class="indent2"><span class="nm">3.</span><p>Sons- his grandchildren from his daughter.</p></div>
<div class="subject"><span class="nm">8)</span><p>THE ACCOSTING BABYLONIANS</p></div>
<div class="indent1"><span class="nm">(a)</span><p>They were not actually Babylonians but Alexandrians.</p></div>
<div class="indent1"><span class="nm">(b)</span><p>The term Babylonian was used derogatorily owing to the Jews' hatred of that people.</p></div>
<div class="indent1"><span class="nm">(c)</span><p>This was comforting to R. Yosi in the supporting Beraisa._</p></div>
