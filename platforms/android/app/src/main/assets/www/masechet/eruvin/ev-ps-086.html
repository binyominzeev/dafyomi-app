<div class="indent1"><span class="nm">(b)</span><p>Another man (Ploni) came in front of Rebbi. Rebbi commanded 'clear a [more dignified] place for a multimillionaire.'</p></div>
<div class="indent2"><span class="nm">1.</span><p><span class="cl">R. Yishmael b'Rebbi Yosi:</span> Bunyas owns 1000 ships on the sea and 1000 cities! (Surely his son is richer than Ploni.)</p></div>
<div class="indent2"><span class="nm">2.</span><p><span class="cl">Rebbi:</span> Tell Bunyas to give to his son clothes appropriate for his wealth. (His clothes belie his awesome wealth.)</p></div>
<div class="indent1"><span class="nm">(c)</span><p>Rebbi used to honor rich people. (Gilyon ha'Shas - Rebbi did not want to be honored for his Torah. He preferred that the honor people show to him be for his wealth.)</p></div>
<div class="indent1"><span class="nm">(d)</span><p>R. Akiva used to honor rich people;</p></div>
<div class="indent2"><span class="nm">1.</span><p><span class="cl">(Rava bar Mari):</span> "Yeshev Olam...Chesed v'Emes Man Yintzeruhu" - the world is settled when there is Chesed and truth (rich people finance the poor. Aruch - one remains wealthy only if he does Chesed, therefore one should honor the rich.)</p></div>
<div class="indent1"><span class="nm">(e)</span><p><span class="cl">Answer #2 (Rabah bar bar Chanah):</span> Owning [and having the right to access] a peg of a plow is Tefisas Yad.</p></div>
<div class="indent1"><span class="nm">(f)</span><p><span class="cl">(Rav Nachman):</span> If the owner [of the pen or storehouse] owns [and has the right to access] something that may be moved on Shabbos (this is not Tefisas Yad, for the tenant could remove it), he (the tenant) forbids;</p></div>
<div class="indent2"><span class="nm">1.</span><p>If he owns something that may not be moved on Shabbos, he does not forbid.</p></div>
<div class="indent1"><span class="nm">(g)</span><p><span class="cl">Support (Beraisa):</span> If he owns Tevel or big chunks of iron or anything forbidden to move on Shabbos, he (the tenant) does not forbid.</p></div>
<div class="subject"><span class="nm">2)</span><p>ONE WHO IS AWAY FOR SHABBOS</p></div>
<div class="indent1"><span class="nm">(a)</span><p><span class="cl">(Mishnah - R. Meir):</span> If one left his house and went to another city, he forbids, whether he is a Yisrael or Nochri.</p></div>
<div class="indent1"><span class="nm">(b)</span><p>R. Yehudah says, he does not forbid;</p></div>
<div class="indent1"><span class="nm">(c)</span><p>R. Yosi says, a Nochri forbids, but a Yisrael does not, for he is unlikely to return on Shabbos.</p></div>
<div class="indent1"><span class="nm">(d)</span><p>R. Shimon says, even if he left his house to spend Shabbos with his daughter in the same city, he does not forbid, for he does not plan to return.</p></div>
<div class="indent1"><span class="nm">(e)</span><p><span class="cl">(Gemara - Rav):</span> The Halachah follows R. Shimon.</p></div>
<div class="indent1"><span class="nm">(f)</span><p>This is only if he went to spend Shabbos with his daughter, but not if he went to spend Shabbos with his son. (Perhaps he will quarrel with his daughter-in-law and return home);</p></div>
<div class="indent2"><span class="nm">1.</span><p>This is like people say, if a male dog barks, enter. If a female barks, leave. (Aruch - males quiet down, but females do not. Similarly, if you will quarrel with a son-in-law, you can appease him, you cannot appease a daughter-in-law.)</p></div>
<div class="subject"><span class="nm">3)</span><p>A PIT BETWEEN TWO CHATZEROS</p></div>
<div class="indent1"><span class="nm">(a)</span><p><span class="cl">(Mishnah):</span> If there is a pit [on the boundary] between two Chatzeros, neither may draw water from it unless there is a 10 Tefachim Mechitzah. It can be below (this will be explained) or inside the brim [of the pit];</p></div>
<div class="indent1"><span class="nm">(b)</span><p>R. Shimon ben Gamliel says, Beis Shamai require the Mechitzah to be below. Beis Hillel permit it to be above;</p></div>
<div class="indent1"><span class="nm">(c)</span><p>R. Yehudah says, it is no better than the wall between the Chatzeros! (The wall itself permits.)</p></div>
<div class="indent1"><span class="nm">(d)</span><p><span class="cl">(Gemara - Rav Huna):</span> Beis Shamai require the Mechitzah to be truly below [near the water, but it need not touch the water]. Beis Hillel allow it to be at the top, as long as it is inside the pit itself;</p></div>
<div class="indent1"><span class="nm">(e)</span><p><span class="cl">(Rav Yehudah):</span> Beis Shamai require it to be below the water (Rashi - it must reach the ground; Tosfos - it need not). Beis Hillel allow it to be above the water (nearby, but it may not be near the top of the pit. See Perush Chai diagram, Perek 8 number 86, in the <a href=../chai/eruv-8chai086.jpg>English Charts</a> section.)</p></div>
<div class="indent1"><span class="nm">(f)</span><p><span class="cl">Question (Rabah bar Rav Chanan):</span> Presumably, Rav Yehudah [says that Beis Shamai] requires it to be below the water, for otherwise water on both sides will (Tosfos - visibly) mix. Even if it is below, water will mix!</p></div>
<div class="indent1"><span class="nm">(g)</span><p><span class="cl">Answer (Abaye):</span> Rav Yehudah said in the name of Rav that the tops of the beams [of the Mechitzah] must stick out of the water a Tefach [so water will not mix (Tosfos - visibly; Rashi - at all)].</p></div>
<div class="indent1"><span class="nm">(h)</span><p><span class="cl">Question (Rabah bar Rav Chanan):</span> Rav Yehudah [says that Beis Hillel] permits it to be above the water, but not at the top [of the pit]. Surely, the top is invalid because the water [visibly] mixes below. Also if it is above the water, water mixes below!</p></div>
<div class="indent1"><span class="nm">(i)</span><p><span class="cl">Answer (Abaye - Yakov Karchina'ah - Beraisa):</span> The beams [of the Mechitzah] must be submerged a Tefach in the water.</p></div>
<div class="indent1"><span class="nm">(j)</span><p><span class="cl">Question:</span> Rav Yehudah taught that a Korah four Tefachim wide permits [carrying underneath it] in a ruin [due to Pi Tikra Yored v'Sosem, it is as if the edges extend down to make Mechitzos], and Rav Nachman taught that a Korah four Tefachim wide permits [drawing] water (Rashi - from a pit between two Chatzeros; Tosfos - even from a stream. Outside the Korah is a Karmelis);</p></div>
<div class="bbbline">86b----------------------------------------86b</p></div>
<div class="indent2"><span class="nm">1.</span><p>The bucket might go to the other side of the Korah [and draw water from another Reshus! Rashi - we ask against Rav Yehudah, who requires a division. Tosfos - we ask against Rav Nachman. We permitted only from a pit between Chatzeros (Reshus ha'Yachid), but not from a Karmelis!]</p></div>
<div class="indent1"><span class="nm">(k)</span><p><span class="cl">Answer:</span> Chachamim know that a bucket will not drift four Tefachim to the other side of the Korah.</p></div>
<div class="indent1"><span class="nm">(l)</span><p><span class="cl">Question:</span> The bucket draws from under the Korah! (No Mechitzah separates the Reshuyos.)</p></div>
<div class="indent1"><span class="nm">(m)</span><p><span class="cl">Answer:</span> This is a leniency that Chachamim gave regarding water, like Rav taught. (Tosfos - we are not concerned for the lack of a Mechitzah. Rashi - Rav Yehudah's opinion is rejected):</p></div>
<div class="indent2"><span class="nm">1.</span><p><span class="cl">Question (R. Tavla):</span> Does a hanging Mechitzah permit carrying in a ruined house?</p></div>
<div class="indent2"><span class="nm">2.</span><p><span class="cl">Answer (Rav):</span> Chachamim gave this leniency only regarding water. (See Perush Chai diagram, Perek 1 number 160, in the <a href=../chai/eruv-1chai160.jpg>English Charts</a> section.)</p></div>
<div class="subject"><span class="nm">4)</span><p>WHEN IS A HANGING MECHITZAH VALID?</p></div>
<div class="indent1"><span class="nm">(a)</span><p><span class="cl">(Mishnah - R. Yehudah):</span> The Mechitzah is no better [than the wall between the Chatzeros]!</p></div>
<div class="indent1"><span class="nm">(b)</span><p><span class="cl">(Rabah bar bar Chanah):</span> R. Yehudah holds like R. Yosi, who is Machshir a hanging Mechitzah even above land:</p></div>
<div class="indent2"><span class="nm">1.</span><p><span class="cl">(Mishnah):</span> If one lowered walls [of a Sukah] from above, if they are three Tefachim off the ground they are Pesulim. If one builds walls up from the bottom, if they are 10 Tefachim tall, they are Kesherim;</p></div>
<div class="indent2"><span class="nm">2.</span><p>R. Yosi says, just like a 10 Tefachim wall from the bottom up is Kosher, also a 10 Tefachim wall from the top down [even if it hangs high above the ground]!</p></div>
<div class="indent1"><span class="nm">(c)</span><p><span class="cl">Rejection:</span> Neither R. Yehudah nor R. Yosi need hold like the other:</p></div>
<div class="indent2"><span class="nm">1.</span><p>R. Yehudah relies on a wall above to permit [water between] Chatzeros that were not Me'arev, an Isur mid'Rabanan. He would not permit regarding Sukah, which is mid'Oraisa;</p></div>
<div class="indent2"><span class="nm">2.</span><p>R. Yosi relies on a wall above to permit [eating and sleeping outside a] Sukah, which never entails more than an Isur Aseh (failing to fulfil a positive Mitzvah). He would not permit regarding [even a mid'Rabanan Isur] of Shabbos, for one can be Chayav Misah for transgressing Shabbos! (Ritva - surely, it is a mere stringency mid'Rabanan not to rely on a hanging Mechitzah. Mid'Oraisa, we would not distinguish between Mitzvos.)</p></div>
<div class="indent1"><span class="nm">(d)</span><p><span class="cl">Question:</span> A hanging Mechitzah was permitted in Tzipori. Surely, it was according to R. Yosi (the biggest Chacham of Tzipori)!</p></div>
<div class="indent1"><span class="nm">(e)</span><p><span class="cl">Answer:</span> No, it was according to R. Yishmael b'Rebbi Yosi [after R. Yosi died];</p></div>
<div class="indent2"><span class="nm">1.</span><p><span class="cl">(Rav Dimi):</span> Once, they forgot to bring a Sefer Torah to the Beis ha'Keneses from before Shabbos. On Shabbos, they spread curtains on pillars [to make Mechitzos] and brought a Sefer Torah from a house and read in it.</p></div>
<div class="indent2"><span class="nm">2.</span><p><span class="cl">Objection:</span> All agree that one may not make a new temporary Ohel on Shabbos! (Rashi (Sukah 16b DH me'Heichan) says that the Gemara asks 'from where did they bring the curtains'?; The text cannot ask about making an Ohel, for they did not make a roof, only Mechitzos. Tosfos defends the text. Also making the walls is forbidden due to making an Ohel.)</p></div>
<div class="indent2"><span class="nm">3.</span><p><span class="cl">Answer:</span> Rather, they found curtains spread on pillars, and relied on them to bring a Sefer Torah from a house and read in it.</p></div>
