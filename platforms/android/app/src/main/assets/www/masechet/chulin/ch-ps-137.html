<div class="subject"><span class="nm">1)</span><p>WHY WE DO NOT LEARN FROM BECHOR</p></div>
<div class="indent1"><span class="nm">(a)</span><p>Version #1 (our text, Rashi) Summation of question: There are eight similarities to a Bechor. We should learn from it!</p></div>
<div class="indent1"><span class="nm">(b)</span><p><span class="cl">Version #2 - Answer #1:</span> There are fewer (six) similarities to a Bechor (the Aruch's text omits "animals received for a gift" and "in front"; Ritva - jointly owned animals and (animals received for) a gift are counted like one). Therefore, we learn from Ma'aser. (end of Version #2)</p></div>
<div class="indent1"><span class="nm">(c)</span><p><span class="cl">Answer (Aruch - Answer #2):</span> The decisive similarity is that it does not apply to firstborns.</p></div>
<div class="subject"><span class="nm">2)</span><p>ONLY SHEEP'S WOOL IS GIVEN</p></div>
<div class="indent1"><span class="nm">(a)</span><p><span class="cl">(Mishnah):</span> Reishis ha'Gez applies only to sheep.</p></div>
<div class="indent1"><span class="nm">(b)</span><p><span class="cl">Question:</span> What is the source of this?</p></div>
<div class="indent1"><span class="nm">(c)</span><p><span class="cl">Answer (Rav Chisda):</span> We learn "Gizah-Gizah" from Iyov;</p></div>
<div class="indent2"><span class="nm">1.</span><p>Just like there it refers to sheep - "umi'Gez Kevasai Yischamam" - also here.</p></div>
<div class="indent1"><span class="nm">(d)</span><p><span class="cl">Question:</span> Why don't we learn "Gizah-Gizah" from Bechor (that it applies even to oxen)!</p></div>
<div class="indent2"><span class="nm">1.</span><p><span class="cl">(Beraisa) Question:</span> "Lo Sa'avod bi'Vechor Shorecha v'Lo Sagoz Bechor Tzonecha" - what is the source to forbid working with a Bechor Seh or shearing a Bechor ox?</p></div>
<div class="indent2"><span class="nm">2.</span><p><span class="cl">Answer:</span> "Lo Sa'avod... v'Lo Sagoz." (We apply what is said about each to the other.)</p></div>
<div class="indent1"><span class="nm">(e)</span><p><span class="cl">Answer:</span> "Titen Lo" - give something that the Kohen can wear, but not ox hair, which is used to make sackcloth.</p></div>
<div class="indent1"><span class="nm">(f)</span><p><span class="cl">Question:</span> Goats' wool (which one plucks off goats) can be used for garments. Reishis ha'Gez should apply to it!</p></div>
<div class="indent1"><span class="nm">(g)</span><p><span class="cl">Answer #1:</span> The Torah discusses only Gizah (shearing), but not plucking.</p></div>
<div class="indent1"><span class="nm">(h)</span><p><span class="cl">Rejection:</span> R. Yosi (below, 3:c-e) is the Tana who distinguishes between words that refer to detaching, and he says that the normal method (for each species) is included!</p></div>
<div class="indent1"><span class="nm">(i)</span><p><span class="cl">Answer #2:</span> This is like R. Yehoshua ben Levi, who expounds "La'amod Leshares" - it must be fitting for the Techeles of the Kohanim's garments, i.e. sheep's wool.</p></div>
<div class="indent1"><span class="nm">(j)</span><p><span class="cl">Question:</span> What do we learn from "Gizah-Gizah"?</p></div>
<div class="indent1"><span class="nm">(k)</span><p><span class="cl">Answer (Beraisa - Tana d'Vei R. Yishmael):</span> Reishis ha'Gez does not apply to sheep whose wool is too hard to make garments (that give warmth) - "umi'Gez Kevasai Yischamam."</p></div>
<div class="subject"><span class="nm">3)</span><p>OTHER WAYS OF TAKING OF THE WOOL</p></div>
<div class="indent1"><span class="nm">(a)</span><p><span class="cl">(Beraisa #1):</span> If one shears goats or washes sheep (this causes wool to come off), Reishis ha'Gez does not apply;</p></div>
<div class="indent1"><span class="nm">(b)</span><p><span class="cl">Contradiction (Beraisa #2):</span> If one shears goats, he is exempt from Reishis ha'Gez. If he washes sheep, he is liable.</p></div>
<div class="indent1"><span class="nm">(c)</span><p><span class="cl">Answer:</span> Beraisa #1 is R. Yosi, Beraisa #2 is Chachamim.</p></div>
<div class="indent2"><span class="nm">1.</span><p><span class="cl">(Beraisa):</span> (One must leave for the poor) "Leket Ketzircha" (what falls during harvesting), but not Leket of Kituf (plucking);</p></div>
<div class="indent2"><span class="nm">2.</span><p>R. Yosi says, "Leket" refers only to what comes through Ketzirah.</p></div>
<div class="indent2"><span class="nm">3.</span><p><span class="cl">Question:</span> The first Tana also says so!</p></div>
<div class="indent2"><span class="nm">4.</span><p><span class="cl">Answer:</span> The entire Beraisa is R. Yosi. He says "this is because 'Leket' refers only to what comes through Ketzirah.'</p></div>
<div class="indent1"><span class="nm">(d)</span><p><span class="cl">(Rav Acha brei d'Rava):</span> R. Yosi admits that "Katzir" includes the normal method;</p></div>
<div class="indent2"><span class="nm">1.</span><p><span class="cl">(Beraisa - R. Yosi) Question:</span> The Torah says "Katzir". What is the source to include uprooting?</p></div>
<div class="indent2"><span class="nm">2.</span><p><span class="cl">Answer:</span> It says "Liktzor";</p></div>
<div class="indent2"><span class="nm">3.</span><p><span class="cl">Question:</span> What is the source to include plucking?</p></div>
<div class="indent2"><span class="nm">4.</span><p><span class="cl">Answer:</span> It says "b'Kutzrecha."</p></div>
<div class="indent1"><span class="nm">(e)</span><p><span class="cl">Support (Ravina - Mishnah - R. Yosi):</span> If there are rows of onions between patches of vegetables, (the vegetables are an interruption, so) Pe'ah must be left for each row. (Even though onions are not harvested with a scythe, Pe'ah must be left, for the normal way of detaching is included);</p></div>
<div class="indent2"><span class="nm">1.</span><p>Chachamim say, one Pe'ah may be left for all the rows.</p></div>
<div class="subject"><span class="nm">4)</span><p>THE AMOUNT OF SHEEP THAT IS LIABLE</p></div>
<div class="indent1"><span class="nm">(a)</span><p><span class="cl">(Mishnah) Question:</span> What is the quantity (from which Gez must be given)?</p></div>
<div class="indent1"><span class="nm">(b)</span><p><span class="cl">Question:</span> We understand Beis Shamai. Two sheep are called "Tzon";</p></div>
<div class="indent2"><span class="nm">1.</span><p>What is Beis Hillel's reason (to say five)?</p></div>
<div class="indent1"><span class="nm">(c)</span><p><span class="cl">Answer #1 (Rav Kahana):</span> "V'Chamesh Tzon Asuyos" - two Mitzvos apply to a group of five sheep, i.e. Reishis ha'Gez and Matanos.</p></div>
<div class="indent2"><span class="nm">1.</span><p><span class="cl">Suggestion:</span> Perhaps the Mitzvos are Bechor and Matanos!</p></div>
<div class="indent2"><span class="nm">2.</span><p><span class="cl">Rejection:</span> Even one Bechor Seh is Kodesh.</p></div>
<div class="indent1"><span class="nm">(d)</span><p><span class="cl">Objection:</span> Matanos apply to a single sheep! (We cannot say that two Mitzvos apply only when there are five.)</p></div>
<div class="indent1"><span class="nm">(e)</span><p><span class="cl">Answer #2 (Rav Ashi):</span> "Asuyos" means, they obligate their owner in a Mitzvah that did not apply to less than five. (This must be Reishis ha'Gez.)</p></div>
<div class="indent1"><span class="nm">(f)</span><p><span class="cl">(Beraisa - Tana d'Vei R. Yishmael b'Rebbi Yosi):</span> The Mitzvah applies to four, for four are called "Tzon" - "v'Arba Tzon Tachas ha'Seh."</p></div>
<div class="indent1"><span class="nm">(g)</span><p><span class="cl">(Beraisa - Rebbi):</span> Even if Beis Shamai and Beis Hillel learned from Torah verses, and R. Yosi learned from Nevi'im, we would follow R. Yosi;</p></div>
<div class="indent2"><span class="nm">1.</span><p>Really, Beis Shamai and Beis Hillel learned from Nevi'im, and R. Yosi learned from Torah. All the more so, we should follow R. Yosi!</p></div>
<div class="indent1"><span class="nm">(h)</span><p><span class="cl">Question:</span> (Presumably, the preference for R. Yosi is because he is Machri'a (a mediating opinion).) A third opinion (Rashi - it introduces an idea that the first two opinions never mentioned; Aruch - of a Tana smaller than the first two) is not a Hachra'ah!</p></div>
<div class="bbbline">137b----------------------------------------137b</p></div>
<div class="indent1"><span class="nm">(i)</span><p><span class="cl">Answer (R. Yochanan):</span> The reason to follow R. Yosi is because his law is a tradition from Chagai, Zecharyah and Malachi (the last Nevi'im).</p></div>
<div class="subject"><span class="nm">5)</span><p>THE AMOUNT OF SHEARINGS THAT IS LIABLE</p></div>
<div class="indent1"><span class="nm">(a)</span><p><span class="cl">(Mishnah):</span> R. Dosa ben Hurkanus says... (Chachamim say, he is liable for any amount.)</p></div>
<div class="indent1"><span class="nm">(b)</span><p><span class="cl">Question:</span> What do Chachamim call "any amount"?</p></div>
<div class="indent1"><span class="nm">(c)</span><p><span class="cl">Answer #1 (Rav):</span> It must be a Maneh (25 Sela'im, about a pound) and a half (from all five sheep combined).</p></div>
<div class="indent1"><span class="nm">(d)</span><p><span class="cl">Answer #2 (Shmuel):</span> It must be 60 Sela'im. He gives one Sela to the Kohen.</p></div>
<div class="indent1"><span class="nm">(e)</span><p><span class="cl">Answer #3 (R. Yochanan):</span> It must be six Sela'im. He gives five to the Kohen, and keeps one.</p></div>
<div class="indent1"><span class="nm">(f)</span><p><span class="cl">Answer #4 (Ula):</span> It is any amount, no matter how small.</p></div>
<div class="indent1"><span class="nm">(g)</span><p><span class="cl">(Mishnah):</span> One must give to the Kohen five Sela'im of Yehudah (this is ten of Galil).</p></div>
<div class="indent1"><span class="nm">(h)</span><p><span class="cl">Question #1:</span> This refutes Shmuel (who said he gives one to the Kohen) and Ula (who says that any amount is liable)!</p></div>
<div class="indent1"><span class="nm">(i)</span><p><span class="cl">Question #2:</span> This is also difficult for Rav!</p></div>
<div class="indent2"><span class="nm">1.</span><p><span class="cl">(Rav and Shmuel):</span> One must give (or regarding Pe'ah, leave) one part in 60 of the following - Gez, Terumah, and Pe'ah. (According to Rav, one must give from a Maneh and a half. A 60th part of this is less than a Sela!)</p></div>
<div class="indent1"><span class="nm">(j)</span><p><span class="cl">Answer (to both questions - Rav and Shmuel):</span> The Mishnah teaches that if a Yisrael has much shearings and wants to give them to more than one Kohen, he must give to each Kohen five Sela'im.</p></div>
<div class="subject"><span class="nm">6)</span><p>THE QUANTITIES OF VARIOUS MATANOS</p></div>
<div class="indent1"><span class="nm">(a)</span><p><span class="cl">(Rav and Shmuel):</span> One must give (or leave) one part in 60 of Gez, Terumah, and Pe'ah.</p></div>
<div class="indent1"><span class="nm">(b)</span><p><span class="cl">Question (Mishnah):</span> A generous separation of Terumah is one part in 40... (Rashi - why do Rav and Shmuel suggest giving like a stingy person? Tosfos - the Mishnah teaches that one may give one part in 60. They did not need to teach this!)</p></div>
<div class="indent1"><span class="nm">(c)</span><p><span class="cl">Answer #1:</span> They teach that mid'Oraisa, one must give one in 60. Mid'Rabanan, one should give one in 40.</p></div>
<div class="indent1"><span class="nm">(d)</span><p><span class="cl">Rejection:</span> Shmuel himself taught that even one blade of wheat exempts the entire stack (mid'Oraisa)!</p></div>
<div class="indent1"><span class="nm">(e)</span><p><span class="cl">Answer #2:</span> Mid'Oraisa, one blade exempts the entire stack;</p></div>
<div class="indent2"><span class="nm">1.</span><p>Regarding Terumah mid'Oraisa (grain, wine and oil), Chachamim enacted that one should give one in 40;</p></div>
<div class="indent2"><span class="nm">2.</span><p>Regarding (other) produce that is liable mid'Rabanan, Chachamim require one to give one in 60.</p></div>
<div class="indent1"><span class="nm">(f)</span><p><span class="cl">Question (Mishnah):</span> There is no Shi'ur (fixed quantity) for the following: Pe'ah, Bikurim, and the (cost of) the Olah and Shelamim that each man must bring on each festival.</p></div>
<div class="indent1"><span class="nm">(g)</span><p><span class="cl">Answer:</span> Mid'Oraisa, there is no Shi'ur for Pe'ah. Mid'Rabanan, it is one in 60.</p></div>
<div class="indent1"><span class="nm">(h)</span><p><span class="cl">Question:</span> A Mishnah teaches this!</p></div>
<div class="indent2"><span class="nm">1.</span><p><span class="cl">(Mishnah):</span> Even though Pe'ah has no Shi'ur mid'Oraisa, (mid'Rabanan) one must leave one in 60.</p></div>
<div class="indent1"><span class="nm">(i)</span><p><span class="cl">Answer:</span> The Mishnah teaches the law in Eretz Yisrael. Rav and Shmuel teach the law in Chutz la'Aretz.</p></div>
