<p class="bas indent1"><span class="nm">(a)</span><span class="cl">(Continuation of Mishnah):</span> If his wife miscarried, he is not a Nazir;</p>
<p class="bas indent1"><span class="nm">(b)</span>R. Shimon says, he stipulates:</p>
<p class="bas indent2"><span class="nm">1.</span>If the baby was viable (but just happened to die), my vow compels me to be a Nazir;</p>
<p class="bas indent2"><span class="nm">2.</span>If it was a Nefel (stillborn), I now accept to be a Nazir.</p>
<p class="bas indent1"><span class="nm">(c)</span>If later, his wife gave birth, he is a Nazir;</p>
<p class="bas indent1"><span class="nm">(d)</span>R. Shimon says, he stipulates:</p>
<p class="bas indent2"><span class="nm">1.</span>If the first baby was viable, my previous Nezirus fulfilled my initial vow. I now accept to be a Nazir;</p>
<p class="bas indent2"><span class="nm">2.</span>If the first baby was stillborn, my first Nezirus was voluntary, and now I am a Nazir due to my initial vow.</p>
<p class="bas indent1"><span class="nm">(e)</span><span class="cl">(Gemara) Question:</span> Obviously, if a son was born, he is a Nazir, like he vowed!</p>
<p class="bas indent1"><span class="nm">(f)</span><span class="cl">Answer:</span> The Chidush is that he is not a Nazir if a girl, Tumtum or Androginus was born.</p>
<p class="bas indent2"><span class="nm">1.</span>One might have thought that when he said 'when I have a Ben (son)', he meant 'when Evneh (I will be built, i.e. have children).' The Mishnah teaches that this is not so.</p>
<p class="bas indent1"><span class="nm">(g)</span><span class="cl">(Mishnah):</span> If one said 'I will be a Nazir when I have a child', even if a girl, Tumtum or Androginus is born, he is a Nazir;</p>
<p class="bas indent1"><span class="nm">(h)</span><span class="cl">Question:</span> This is obvious!</p>
<p class="bas indent1"><span class="nm">(i)</span><span class="cl">Answer:</span> One might have thought that he meant a child that people consider important, i.e. a son. The Mishnah teaches that this is not so.</p>
<p class="bas indent1"><span class="nm">(j)</span><span class="cl">(Mishnah):</span> If his wife miscarried, he is not a Nazir.</p>
<p class="bas indent1"><span class="nm">(k)</span><span class="cl">Question:</span> Who is the Tana of the Mishnah?</p>
<p class="bas indent1"><span class="nm">(l)</span><span class="cl">Answer:</span> It is R. Yehudah in the Beraisa about a stack (8a. If one accepted Nezirus contingent on the size of a certain stack, and we were unable to measure it, R. Shimon forbids, for Safek Nezirus Lehachmir. R. Yehudah permits, Safek Nezirus Lehakel.)</p>
<p class="bas indent1"><span class="nm">(m)</span><span class="cl">(Mishnah - R. Shimon):</span> He says 'if the baby was viable, I am a Nazir due to my vow. If it was a Nefel, I now accept to be a Nazir.'</p>
<p class="bas indent1"><span class="nm">(n)</span><span class="cl">Question (R. Aba):</span> If one said 'I will be a Nazir when I will have a son', his wife miscarried, he separated a Korban (for his Nezirus), and his wife gave birth, what is the law? (Tosfos - she gave birth from the same pregnancy. Presumably, also the first baby was viable.)</p>
<p class="bas indent2"><span class="nm">1.</span><span class="cl">Question:</span> According to whom does he ask?</p>
<p class="bas indent3"><span class="nm">i.</span>R. Shimon holds that Safek Nezirus Lehachmir. Surely, he holds that the animal became Kodesh!</p>
<p class="bas indent2"><span class="nm">2.</span><span class="cl">Answer:</span> He asks according to R. Yehudah, who says that Safek Nezirus Lehakel. Is the animal Kodesh?</p>
<p class="bas indent3"><span class="nm">i.</span>If it is, one may not shear nor work with it.</p>
<p class="bas indent1"><span class="nm">(o)</span>This question is unresolved.</p>
<p class="bas subject"><span class="nm">2)</span><i>HATFASAH</i> IN CONDITIONAL <i>NEZIRUS</i></p>
<p class="bas indent1"><span class="nm">(a)</span><span class="cl">Question #1 (Ben Rechumi):</span> If Reuven said 'I will be a Nazir when I will have a son', and Levi heard, and said 'and it is Alai (some texts - also I)':</p>
<p class="bas indent2"><span class="nm">1.</span>Does Levi refer to Reuven's words? (Also, I (Levi) will be a Nazir when I will have a son.)</p>
<p class="bas indent2"><span class="nm">2.</span>Or, does Levi refer to Reuven himself? (Also I will be a Nazir when you have a son.)</p>
<p class="bas indent1"><span class="nm">(b)</span><span class="cl">Version #1 - Question #2:</span> If you will say that he refers to Reuven himself, if Levi said 'and I', what is the law?</p>
<p class="bas indent2"><span class="nm">1.</span>Does Levi refer to himself? (And I will be a Nazir when I have a son.)</p>
<p class="bas indent2"><span class="nm">2.</span>Or, does he (refer to Reuven, i.e. and (also) I will be a Nazir when you have a son, to) show that he loves Reuven like Reuven himself does?</p>
<p class="bas indent1"><span class="nm">(c)</span><span class="cl">Version #2 - Question #2:</span> If you will say that he refers to Reuven himself, if Reuven said 'I will be a Nazir when you will have a son', and Levi said 'and I', what is the law?</p>
<p class="bas indent2"><span class="nm">1.</span>Does Levi refer to himself?</p>
<p class="bas indent2"><span class="nm">2.</span>Or, does he (refer to Reuven, i.e. and when you have a son, also I will be a Nazir, to) show that he loves Reuven just like Reuven loves him? (end of Version #2)</p>
<p class="bas bbbline">13b----------------------------------------13b</p>
<p class="bas indent1"><span class="nm">(d)</span><span class="cl">Question #3:</span> If whenever Reuven is there, we say that Levi is embarrassed (he accepts Nezirus when Reuven will have a son, to show his love for him. Rashi - if not, he would not vow in front of Reuven), what if Reuven said 'I will be a Nazir when Ploni will have a son'; and Levi said 'and I'?</p>
<p class="bas indent2"><span class="nm">1.</span>Do we say that since Ploni is not there, Levi refers to himself?</p>
<p class="bas indent2"><span class="nm">2.</span>Or, does he show that also he loves Ploni (and when Ploni has a son, Shimon is a Nazir)?</p>
<p class="bas indent1"><span class="nm">(e)</span>These questions are not resolved.</p>
<p class="bas subject"><span class="nm">3)</span>OVERLAPPING <i>NEZIRUYOS</i></p>
<p class="bas indent1"><span class="nm">(a)</span><span class="cl">(Mishnah):</span> One said 'I am a Nazir, and I will be a Nazir when I have a son.' If he started conducting Nezirus, and had a son. he finishes his Nezirus, then conducts the Nezirus he accepted for birth of the son.</p>
<p class="bas indent1"><span class="nm">(b)</span>If he said 'I will be a Nazir when I have a son, and I am a Nazir', and he began Nezirus, and had a son, he interrupts his Nezirus, conducts the Nezirus he accepted for birth of the son, then completes his Nezirus.</p>
<p class="bas indent1"><span class="nm">(c)</span><span class="cl">(Gemara - Rava) Question #1:</span> If one said 'I will be a Nazir after 20 days, and I am a Nazir from now for 100 days', what is the law?</p>
<p class="bas indent2"><span class="nm">1.</span>Since 100 days do not fit into 20, the 100-day Nezirus does not take effect (until after finishing the Nezirus after 20 days);</p>
<p class="bas indent2"><span class="nm">2.</span>Or, since 80 days remain, and he will have more than the 30 days growth of hair needed to shave when bringing his Korbanos, it takes effect right away!</p>
