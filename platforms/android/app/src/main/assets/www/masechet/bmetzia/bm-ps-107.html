<p class="bas subject"><span class="nm">1)</span>PLANTING DIFFERENTLY THAN AGREED (cont.)</p>
<p class="bas indent1"><span class="nm">(a)</span><span class="cl">Answer (Abaye):</span> In our Mishnah, R. Shimon ben Gamliel forbids due to Rabah's reason. (Based on what the owner planted last year, planting wheat might be better for the field.)</p>
<p class="bas indent2"><span class="nm">1.</span><span class="cl">Version #1 - Rashi (Rabah):</span> If one plants wheat and the next year barley, or one year widthwise and the next year lengthwise, this will ruin the field;</p>
<p class="bas indent2"><span class="nm">2.</span><span class="cl">Version #2 - Tosfos (Rabah):</span> If one plants wheat and the next year barley, or one year widthwise and the next year lengthwise, this will improve the field; (end of Version #2)</p>
<p class="bas indent3"><span class="nm">i.</span>If he plows after harvesting, this will not happen (so Reuven may plant barley).</p>
<p class="bas indent1"><span class="nm">(b)</span><span class="cl">(Mishnah):</span> If he was Chocher to plant grain, he may not plant legumes...</p>
<p class="bas indent1"><span class="nm">(c)</span>Rav Yehudah taught Ravin that if he was Chocher to plant grain, he may plant legumes.</p>
<p class="bas indent1"><span class="nm">(d)</span><span class="cl">Question (Ravin - Mishnah):</span> If he was Chocher to plant grain, he may not plant legumes. If he was Chocher to plant legumes, he may plant grain.</p>
<p class="bas indent1"><span class="nm">(e)</span><span class="cl">Answer (Rav Yehudah):</span> The Mishnah is for Eretz Yisrael. I taught you the law in Bavel (where the soil is not harmed by legumes).</p>
<p class="bas indent1"><span class="nm">(f)</span><span class="cl">(Rav Yehudah):</span> If leeks grow among flax, one may take them from others' fields (removing them improves the flax more than their own value). If they are on the perimeter of a patch of flax, taking them is theft (because taking them does not help the flax);</p>
<p class="bas indent2"><span class="nm">1.</span>If the leeks have hardened to the point that the seeds are fit for planting, it is theft to take them even amidst the flax.</p>
<p class="bas indent2"><span class="nm">2.</span><span class="cl">Question:</span> What is the reason?</p>
<p class="bas indent2"><span class="nm">3.</span><span class="cl">Answer:</span> They will not cause further harm.</p>
<p class="bas subject"><span class="nm">2)</span>TREES ON THE BORDER</p>
<p class="bas indent1"><span class="nm">(a)</span><span class="cl">Rav Yehudah (to his neighbor Ravin):</span> Some of your fruit is on my premises, and some of my fruit is on your premises (there were trees straddling the border).</p>
<p class="bas indent2"><span class="nm">1.</span>The custom among neighbors is that the fruit belongs to the one in whose premises the roots are.</p>
<p class="bas indent1"><span class="nm">(b)</span><span class="cl">Version #1 - Rashi - (Rav):</span> If a tree is on the border between two fields, the fruit belongs to the one in whose premises the roots are;</p>
<p class="bas indent1"><span class="nm">(c)</span><span class="cl">(Shmuel):</span> They divide the fruit.</p>
<p class="bas indent1"><span class="nm">(d)</span><span class="cl">Question (Beraisa):</span> If a tree stands on the border, the neighbors divide the fruit.</p>
<p class="bas indent1"><span class="nm">(e)</span><span class="cl">Answer (Shmuel, on behalf of Rav):</span> The case is, the roots are in both fields.</p>
<p class="bas indent2"><span class="nm">1.</span><span class="cl">Question:</span> If so, this is obvious!</p>
<p class="bas indent2"><span class="nm">2.</span><span class="cl">Answer:</span> The case is, the branches lean to one side (e.g. the field on the east).</p>
<p class="bas indent1"><span class="nm">(f)</span><span class="cl">Version #2 - Tosfos - (Rav):</span> If a tree lies on the border (jointly owned by the neighbors), they split the branches that are over the border. Each takes the fruit of the branches above his field;</p>
<p class="bas indent1"><span class="nm">(g)</span><span class="cl">(Shmuel):</span> They divide the fruit.</p>
<p class="bas indent1"><span class="nm">(h)</span><span class="cl">Question (Beraisa):</span> If a tree stands on the border, the neighbors divide the fruit.</p>
<p class="bas indent1"><span class="nm">(i)</span><span class="cl">Answer (Shmuel, on behalf of Rav):</span> The case is, the branches are over the border.</p>
<p class="bas indent2"><span class="nm">1.</span><span class="cl">Question:</span> If so, this is obvious!</p>
<p class="bas indent2"><span class="nm">2.</span><span class="cl">Answer:</span> The case is, they produce more fruit on one side (e.g. the east) than the other.(end of Version #2)</p>
<p class="bas indent2"><span class="nm">3.</span><span class="cl">Objection:</span> Still, this is obvious!</p>
<p class="bas indent2"><span class="nm">4.</span><span class="cl">Answer:</span> One might have thought that the neighbor on the east can say 'each of us will take the fruit in his half.' The Beraisa teaches that this is not so. The other says 'one of us will take the northern, and the other will take the southern half.'</p>
<p class="bas subject"><span class="nm">3)</span>BLESSINGS AND CURSES</p>
<p class="bas indent1"><span class="nm">(a)</span><span class="cl">Rav Yehudah (to Ravin):</span> Do not buy land close to the city.</p>
<p class="bas indent2"><span class="nm">1.</span><span class="cl">(R. Aba):</span> One may not look at another's field when it is laden with crops (due to Ayin ha'Ra'ah. Jealousy can arouse harsh judgment from Shamayim.)</p>
<p class="bas indent1"><span class="nm">(b)</span><span class="cl">Question:</span> Rav taught that "Baruch Atah ba'Ir" is a Berachah that your house will be close to the Beis ha'Keneses. "U'Varuch Atah ba'Sadeh" - your property will be close to the city; "Baruch Atah b'Vo'echa" - when you return home, you will not find your wife Safek Nidah; "u'Varuch Atah b'Tzeisecha" - your descendants will be like you;</p>
<p class="bas indent2"><span class="nm">1.</span><span class="cl">(R. Yochanan):</span> "Baruch Atah ba'Ir" is that you will have a Beis ha'Kisei (privy) near your table. A house close to the Beis ha'Keneses is not a Berachah.</p>
<p class="bas indent3"><span class="nm">i.</span>This is like R. Yochanan taught elsewhere, that one is rewarded for every step he takes to walk to the Beis ha'Keneses.</p>
<p class="bas indent2"><span class="nm">2.</span><span class="cl">(R. Yochanan):</span> "U'Varuch Atah ba'Sadeh" - a third of your land will be grain fields, a third olive orchards, and a third vineyards. "Baruch Atah b'Vo'echa u'Varuch Atah b'Tzeiseacha" - you will leave the world like you entered, without sin.</p>
<p class="bas bbbline">107b----------------------------------------107b</p>
<p class="bas indent1"><span class="nm">(c)</span><span class="cl">Answer:</span> It is a Berachah to have property close to the city only if there is a wall so people cannot see in.</p>
<p class="bas indent1"><span class="nm">(d)</span><span class="cl">Opinion #1 (Rav):</span> "V'Hesir Hash-m Mimecha Kol Choli" refers to Ayin ha'Ra'ah.</p>
<p class="bas indent2"><span class="nm">1.</span>This is like he said elsewhere. Rav went to a graveyard and somehow  learned that 99 of every 100 died from Ayin ha'Ra'ah, and only one died normally. (Rashi - he whispered by the graves; Aruch - he asked in a dream, or planted trees and imposed an oath on them; R. Peretz - he just said this. He did not do any action to learn this.)</p>
<p class="bas indent1"><span class="nm">(e)</span><span class="cl">Opinion #2 (Shmuel):</span> "Kol Choli" refers to wind.</p>
<p class="bas indent2"><span class="nm">1.</span>This is like Shmuel holds, that that all sickness and death is due to wind.</p>
<p class="bas indent2"><span class="nm">2.</span><span class="cl">Question:</span> The kingdom beheads people. They do not die due to wind!</p>
<p class="bas indent2"><span class="nm">3.</span><span class="cl">Answer:</span> If not for wind, a potion could be used to reconnect their heads and heal them.</p>
<p class="bas indent1"><span class="nm">(f)</span><span class="cl">Opinion #3 (R. Chanina):</span> "Kol Choli" refers to the cold.</p>
<p class="bas indent2"><span class="nm">1.</span><span class="cl">(R. Chanina):</span> "Tzinim Pachim... Shomer Nafsho Yirchak Mehem" - whatever befalls one is decreed by Heaven, except for chills and fevers (they are due to lack of caution).</p>
<p class="bas indent1"><span class="nm">(g)</span><span class="cl">Opinion #4 (R. Yosi b'Rebbi Chanina):</span> "Kol Choli" refers to mucus and earwax;</p>
<p class="bas indent2"><span class="nm">1.</span>A small amount of them is good. A large amount is harmful.</p>
<p class="bas indent1"><span class="nm">(h)</span><span class="cl">Opinion #5 (R. Elazar):</span> "Kol Choli" refers to Marah (bile).</p>
<p class="bas indent1"><span class="nm">(i)</span><span class="cl">Support (Beraisa):</span> "Machalah" refers to Marah;</p>
<p class="bas indent2"><span class="nm">1.</span>It is called Machalah because it sickens the whole body.</p>
<p class="bas indent2"><span class="nm">2.</span>Also, it is called Machalah because it causes 83 sicknesses (the numerical value of Machalah);</p>
<p class="bas indent3"><span class="nm">i.</span>Eating bread in the morning with salt and drinking water prevents all 83.</p>
<p class="bas indent1"><span class="nm">(j)</span><span class="cl">(Beraisa):</span> There are 13 benefits of eating bread in the morning: it prevents heatstroke, chills, wind and damagers. It gives wisdom to the foolish, it helps him (be settled in Beis Din, which helps him) to win his case, to learn and to teach Torah. People heed his words, he remembers his learning, he does not sweat too much, he desires only his own wife, and it kills intestinal worms;</p>
<p class="bas indent2"><span class="nm">1.</span>Some say, it even dispels envy and promotes love.</p>
<p class="bas indent1"><span class="nm">(k)</span><span class="cl">Question (Rabah):</span> People say 'sixty runners cannot catch one who ate bread in the morning.' Chachamim say 'eat early in summer due to the heat, and in winter due to the cold,. What is the source of these?</p>
<p class="bas indent1"><span class="nm">(l)</span><span class="cl">Answer #1 (Rava bar Mari):</span> "They will not be hungry or thirsty, heat and sun will not strike them (because they already ate)."</p>
<p class="bas indent1"><span class="nm">(m)</span><span class="cl">Answer #2 (Rabah):</span> "You will serve Hash-m" refers to saying "Shema Yisrael" and prayer in the morning. "And He will bless your bread and water" refers to (eating) bread with salt and a flask of water. After this "I will remove sickness from your midst."</p>
<p class="bas subject"><span class="nm">4)</span>WATERFRONT PROPERTY</p>
<p class="bas indent1"><span class="nm">(a)</span><span class="cl">Rav Yehudah (to Rav Ada the land measurer):</span> Be very careful when measuring land. Every tiny piece is fitting for saffron;</p>
<p class="bas indent1"><span class="nm">(b)</span><span class="cl">Version #1 (Rashi):</span> People leave four Amos fallow near an irrigation channel . Don't worry if you mark off less than four.</p>
<p class="bas indent1"><span class="nm">(c)</span><span class="cl">Version #2 (Tosfos):</span> People leave four Amos fallow near an irrigation channel. Give them generously (so people can stand comfortably while drawing water). (end of Version #2)</p>
<p class="bas indent1"><span class="nm">(d)</span>People leave four Amos fallow near the river. Don't even measure it. Rather, give a generous estimation. (Tosfos - if it is too narrow, people pulling ships may fall in!)</p>
<p class="bas indent1"><span class="nm">(e)</span>This is like Rav Yehudah taught elsewhere.</p>
<p class="bas indent2"><span class="nm">1.</span><span class="cl">(Rav Yehudah):</span> The four Amos near an irrigation channel belong to the people who use it; (Rashi - if they get too little, they can forgive this.)</p>
<p class="bas indent2"><span class="nm">2.</span>The four Amos near the river belong to everyone. (Rashi - if they get too little, it is unfeasible to get their forgiveness!)</p>
<p class="bas indent1"><span class="nm">(f)</span><span class="cl">(R. Ami):</span> If trees or a forest grow near the river bank, one may cut whatever interferes with people pulling the ship, on both banks.</p>
<p class="bas indent1"><span class="nm">(g)</span>Rav Nasan bar Hoshiya cut 16 Amos. The owners beat him.</p>
<p class="bas indent2"><span class="nm">1.</span>Rav Nasan reasoned that the width allotted should be like a public road.</p>
<p class="bas indent2"><span class="nm">2.</span>This is wrong. There, 16 Amos are needed. Here, we give only what is needed for people pulling a ship.</p>
<p class="bas indent1"><span class="nm">(h)</span>Rabah bar Rav Huna had a forest on the riverbank. People asked him to cut his trees. He said 'after the owners upstream and downstream cut, also I will cut.'</p>
<p class="bas indent1"><span class="nm">(i)</span><span class="cl">Question:</span> Reish Lakish taught "Hiskosheshu va'Koshu" - first correct yourself before correcting others!</p>
<p class="bas indent1"><span class="nm">(j)</span><span class="cl">Answer:</span> The case was, the owner upstream and downstream was a Nochri officer. Surely, he would not agree to cut;</p>
<p class="bas indent2"><span class="nm">1.</span>Since he would not cut, people pulling the ships would have to be on the other bank in any case. Surely, they would not cross to Rabah's side when they came to his forest.</p>
