<p class="bas subject"><span class="nm">1)</span>DEALINGS WITH <i>NOCHRIM </i>(cont.)</p>
<p class="bas indent1"><span class="nm">(a)</span>This applies only to one witness, but not to two witnesses.</p>
<p class="bas indent2"><span class="nm">1.</span>Even regarding witness, this is only in village courts. Government courts do not make someone pay according to one witness. They only require him to swear, like we do.</p>
<p class="bas indent1"><span class="nm">(b)</span><span class="cl">Question (Rav Huna):</span> If people rely on a great man like two witnesses, do we say that since they make someone pay according to his testimony, he may not testify?</p>
<p class="bas indent2"><span class="nm">1.</span>Or, since he is a great man, he cannot evade them, so he may testify?</p>
<p class="bas indent1"><span class="nm">(c)</span>This question is unsettled.</p>
<p class="bas indent1"><span class="nm">(d)</span><span class="cl">(Rav Ashi):</span> If a Yisrael sold land, bordering on a Yisrael's land, to a Nochri, we excommunicate him.</p>
<p class="bas indent1"><span class="nm">(e)</span><span class="cl">Question:</span> What is the reason?</p>
<p class="bas indent2"><span class="nm">1.</span><span class="cl">Suggestion:</span> It is due to the law of a neighbor (his neighbor should have first option to buy the land).</p>
<p class="bas indent2"><span class="nm">2.</span><span class="cl">Rejection:</span> This law does not apply to one who buys from or sells to a Nochri.</p>
<p class="bas indent1"><span class="nm">(f)</span><span class="cl">Answer:</span> Rather, it is because he brings damage to the Yisrael;</p>
<p class="bas indent2"><span class="nm">1.</span>He is excommunicated until he accepts to pay for any damage that will result.</p>
<p class="bas subject"><span class="nm">2)</span>RECOVERING LOST PROPERTY</p>
<p class="bas indent1"><span class="nm">(a)</span><span class="cl">(Mishnah):</span> If tax collectors or Listim (thieves) took Reuven's donkey or garment and gave him a different one, Reuven may keep it, because the owner despairs.</p>
<p class="bas indent1"><span class="nm">(b)</span>If one saved property from a river, troop (some texts - Nochrim) or robbers, if the owner despaired, he may keep it.</p>
<p class="bas indent1"><span class="nm">(c)</span>Similarly, if the owner of a swarm of bees despaired, the finder may keep it.</p>
<p class="bas indent1"><span class="nm">(d)</span>R. Yochanan ben Berokah says, a woman or child is believed to say that a swarm of bees passed this way; the owner may enter his neighbor's field to save them;</p>
<p class="bas indent2"><span class="nm">1.</span>If he damaged, he pays for the damage.</p>
<p class="bas indent1"><span class="nm">(e)</span>He may not cut off the branch on which they made their hive with intent to pay for it;</p>
<p class="bas indent1"><span class="nm">(f)</span>R. Yishmael, son of R. Yochanan ben Berokah permits this.</p>
<p class="bas indent1"><span class="nm">(g)</span><span class="cl">(Gemara) Version #1 (Beraisa):</span> If a tax collector or thief took Reuven's donkey or garment and gave him a different one, Reuven must return it to the original owner.</p>
<p class="bas indent1"><span class="nm">(h)</span>The Tana holds that one does not acquire through despair alone.</p>
<p class="bas indent1"><span class="nm">(i)</span><span class="cl">Version #2:</span> If Reuven wants to return it, he returns it to the original owner.</p>
<p class="bas indent1"><span class="nm">(j)</span><span class="cl">Question:</span> What is the reason?</p>
<p class="bas indent1"><span class="nm">(k)</span><span class="cl">Answer:</span> The Tana holds that one acquires through despair alone, but one who does not want others' property, he returns it to the original owner.)</p>
<p class="bas indent1"><span class="nm">(l)</span><span class="cl">Version #1 (Mishnah):</span> He may keep it because the owner despairs.</p>
<p class="bas indent1"><span class="nm">(m)</span><span class="cl">(Rav Asi):</span> This applies only to Nochri thieves, but not to Yisrael thieves.</p>
<p class="bas indent2"><span class="nm">1.</span>When Yisraelim took it, he does not despair. He intends to recover his loss in Beis Din.</p>
<p class="bas indent1"><span class="nm">(n)</span><span class="cl">Objection (Rav Yosef):</span> To the contrary! Nochri courts use physical force to carry out their rulings, so the victim of a Nochri thief does not despair;</p>
<p class="bas indent2"><span class="nm">1.</span>Beis Din merely tells people whom they must pay. The victim of a Yisrael thief despairs.</p>
<p class="bas indent1"><span class="nm">(o)</span><span class="cl">Version #2 (Mishnah):</span> If one who saves from Nochrim (some texts - a troop) or thieves, if (we know that) the owner despaired, he may keep it.</p>
<p class="bas indent1"><span class="nm">(p)</span><span class="cl">Inference:</span> Normally, we assume that the owner did not despair.</p>
<p class="bas indent1"><span class="nm">(q)</span><span class="cl">(Rav Asi):</span> This applies only to Nochri thieves, but not to Yisrael thieves.</p>
<p class="bas indent2"><span class="nm">1.</span>Nochri courts use physical force to carry out their rulings, so the victim does not despair;</p>
<p class="bas indent2"><span class="nm">2.</span>Beis Din merely tells people whom they must pay, so the victim despairs.</p>
<p class="bas subject"><span class="nm">3)</span>WHICH THIEVES ACQUIRE THROUGH DESPAIR?</p>
<p class="bas indent1"><span class="nm">(a)</span><span class="cl">(Mishnah):</span> Hides of a Ganav (he stole them covertly) can receive Tum'ah through his intent (to use them without further improvement. He is considered the owner.) Hides of a Gazlan (open robber) are not Mekabel Tum'ah through intent.</p>
<p class="bas indent1"><span class="nm">(b)</span>R. Shimon says, hides of a Gazlan are Mekabel Tum'ah through his intent. Those of a Gazlan are not, because the owner did not despair.</p>
<p class="bas indent1"><span class="nm">(c)</span><span class="cl">(Ula):</span> They argue about when we did not hear whether or not the owner despaired. If we know that he despaired, all agree that one acquires through despair alone.</p>
<p class="bas indent1"><span class="nm">(d)</span><span class="cl">(Rabah):</span> They argue even about when we know that he despaired.</p>
<p class="bas indent1"><span class="nm">(e)</span><span class="cl">Question (against Rabah - Abaye - Mishnah):</span> (They are not Mekabel Tum'ah) because the owner did not despair.</p>
<p class="bas indent2"><span class="nm">1.</span><span class="cl">Inference:</span> Had the owner despaired, it would belong to the thief!</p>
<p class="bas indent1"><span class="nm">(f)</span><span class="cl">Answer (Rabah):</span> The Mishnah means 'because despair of the owner has no effect.'</p>
<p class="bas indent1"><span class="nm">(g)</span><span class="cl">(Mishnah):</span> If tax collectors or Listim (...returned a different donkey, he may keep it, because the owner despaired).</p>
<p class="bas indent1"><span class="nm">(h)</span><span class="cl">Question:</span> Who is the Tana of the Mishnah?</p>
<p class="bas indent2"><span class="nm">1.</span>If it is Chachamim, why do we assume that the owner despaired regarding (a tax collector, who is) a Gazlan?</p>
<p class="bas indent2"><span class="nm">2.</span>If it is R. Shimon, why do we assume that the owner despaired regarding Listim (Ganavim)?</p>
<p class="bas indent1"><span class="nm">(i)</span><span class="cl">Answer #1:</span> According to Ula, we can explain as both Tana'im. The case is, we heard that the owner despaired.</p>
<p class="bas indent2"><span class="nm">1.</span>However, Rabah holds that they argue even when we heard (each Tana holds that despair does not help in one case). How could he answer?</p>
<p class="bas indent1"><span class="nm">(j)</span><span class="cl">Answer #2:</span> It is like R. Shimon. The Mishnah discusses Listim Mezuyan (armed robbers).</p>
<p class="bas indent1"><span class="nm">(k)</span><span class="cl">Question:</span> It already discusses (a tax collector, who is) a Gazlan!</p>
<p class="bas indent1"><span class="nm">(l)</span><span class="cl">Answer:</span> It lists two kinds of Gazlanim.</p>
<p class="bas indent1"><span class="nm">(m)</span><span class="cl">(Beraisa):</span> If a Ganav, Gazlan, or extortionist made what he stole Hekdesh, Terumah or Ma'aser, it takes effect.</p>

<p class="bas indent2"><span class="nm">1.</span>If it is Chachamim, why does Hekdesh (or Terumah...) of a Gazlan take effect? (We do not assume that the owner despaired!)</p>

<p class="bas indent1"><span class="nm">(p)</span><span class="cl">Answer #2:</span> It is like R. Shimon. The Ganav of the Beraisa is an armed robber. (He is called a Ganav because he hides from people.)</p>

<p class="bas indent1"><span class="nm">(s)</span><span class="cl">Answer #3:</span> The Mishnah is like Rebbi;</p>

<p class="bas bbbline">114b----------------------------------------114b</p>

<p class="bas subject"><span class="nm">4)</span>WHICH THIEVES ACQUIRE THROUGH DESPAIR?</p>
<p class="bas indent1"><span class="nm">(a)</span><span class="cl">(Beraisa - Rebbi):</span> A Ganav is like a Gazlan.</p>
<p class="bas indent1"><span class="nm">(b)</span><span class="cl">Question:</span> Does he mean 'like a Gazlan according to Chachamim (who does not acquire)', or 'like a Gazlan according to R. Shimon (who acquires)?'</p>
<p class="bas indent1"><span class="nm">(c)</span><span class="cl">Answer #1 (Mishnah):</span> If tax collectors or Listim (...returned a different donkey, he may keep it).</p>
<p class="bas indent2"><span class="nm">1.</span><span class="cl">Question:</span> Who is the Tana of the Mishnah?</p>
<p class="bas indent3"><span class="nm">i.</span>If it is Chachamim, why do we assume that the owner despaired regarding (a tax collector, who is) a Gazlan?</p>

<p class="bas indent2"><span class="nm">2.</span><span class="cl">Answer #1:</span> If Rebbi means 'like a Gazlan according to R. Shimon' we can say that it is Rebbi;</p>

<p class="bas indent1"><span class="nm">(d)</span><span class="cl">Rejection (and Answer #2 to Question (1)):</span> It is like R. Shimon. The Mishnah discusses Listim Mezuyan.</p>
<p class="bas indent1"><span class="nm">(e)</span><span class="cl">Question:</span> It already discusses (a tax collector, who is) a Gazlan!</p>
<p class="bas indent1"><span class="nm">(f)</span><span class="cl">Answer:</span> It lists two kinds of Gazlanim.</p>

<p class="bas indent1"><span class="nm">(j)</span><span class="cl">Answer:</span> It lists two kinds of Gazlanim.</p>
<p class="bas indent1"><span class="nm">(k)</span><span class="cl">Answer #3 (Rav Ashi):</span> Rebbi taught that the Mishnah refers not only to land. Even if he stole an animal to work with it, they must return it, due to their father's honor (lest it remind people of the theft).</p>
<p class="bas indent2"><span class="nm">1.</span><span class="cl">Inference:</span> If not for the honor of their father, they would be exempt!</p>
<p class="bas indent2"><span class="nm">2.</span><span class="cl">Conclusion:</span> Rebbi means 'like a Gazlan according to R. Shimon.'</p>
<p class="bas subject"><span class="nm">5)</span>OWNERSHIP OF BEES</p>
<p class="bas indent1"><span class="nm">(a)</span><span class="cl">(Mishnah):</span> Similarly, if a swarm of bees...</p>
<p class="bas indent1"><span class="nm">(b)</span><span class="cl">Question:</span> Why does it say 'similarly'?</p>
<p class="bas indent1"><span class="nm">(c)</span><span class="cl">Answer:</span> This teaches even about bees, which one owns only mid'Rabanan (he may keep them only if (we know that) the owner despaired).</p>
<p class="bas indent2"><span class="nm">1.</span>One might have thought that since he only owns them mid'Rabanan, we may assume that the owner despaired. The Mishnah teaches that this is not so.</p>
<p class="bas indent1"><span class="nm">(d)</span><span class="cl">(Mishnah - R. Yochanan ben Berokah):</span> A woman or child is believed...</p>
<p class="bas indent1"><span class="nm">(e)</span><span class="cl">Question:</span> Women and children are invalid witnesses!</p>
<p class="bas indent1"><span class="nm">(f)</span><span class="cl">Answer (Rav Yehudah):</span> The case is, the owner was chasing after them. The woman or child said Lefi Tumo (i.e. unaware of the consequences) that the swarm passed this way.</p>
<p class="bas indent1"><span class="nm">(g)</span><span class="cl">(Rav Ashi):</span> Lefi Tumo is valid only in testimony that a man died (to permit his wife to remarry).</p>
<p class="bas indent1"><span class="nm">(h)</span><span class="cl">Question (Ravina):</span> It is believed about a swarm of bees!</p>
<p class="bas indent1"><span class="nm">(i)</span><span class="cl">Answer (Rav Ashi):</span> That is different, since ownership of bees is only mid'Rabanan.</p>
<p class="bas indent1"><span class="nm">(j)</span><span class="cl">Question:</span> It is believed also for mid'Oraisa matters!</p>
<p class="bas indent2"><span class="nm">1.</span><span class="cl">(Rav Yehudah):</span> A man innocently recounted how his father undressed him and immersed him in order to eat Terumah at night;</p>
<p class="bas indent2"><span class="nm">2.</span><span class="cl">(R. Chanina):</span> He also mentioned that his friends avoided touching him, and they called him 'Yochanan, who eats Chalah (what one separates from the dough and gives to Kohanim, like Terumah)';</p>
<p class="bas indent2"><span class="nm">3.</span>Based on this, Rebbi established him to be a Kohen!</p>
<p class="bas indent1"><span class="nm">(k)</span><span class="cl">Answer:</span> He authorized him to eat only Terumah mid'Rabanan.</p>
<p class="bas indent1"><span class="nm">(l)</span><span class="cl">Question:</span> We do rely on Lefi Tumo for mid'Oraisa matters!</p>
<p class="bas indent2"><span class="nm">1.</span><span class="cl">(Rav Dimi):</span> A case occurred in which a child recounted Lefi Tumo how he was captured with his mother, and was constantly with her. Based on this, Rebbi permitted her to a Kohen.</p>
<p class="bas indent1"><span class="nm">(m)</span><span class="cl">Answer:</span> Chachamim were lenient about a captured woman (because mid'Oraisa, Chazakah permits her to a Kohen).</p>
<p class="bas indent1"><span class="nm">(n)</span><span class="cl">(Mishnah):</span> He may not cut the branch...</p>
<p class="bas indent1"><span class="nm">(o)</span><span class="cl">(Beraisa - R. Yishmael, son of R. Yochanan ben Berokah):</span> The following are enactments of Beis Din:</p>
<p class="bas indent2"><span class="nm">1.</span>If Reuven's bees settled on a branch in Shimon's field, Reuven may cut off the branch to retrieve his bees and pay for the branch;</p>
<p class="bas indent2"><span class="nm">2.</span>(Reuven was carrying a barrel of honey and it broke; Shimon was carrying a barrel of wine, which is cheaper than honey.) Shimon should spill out his wine to save the honey; Reuven pays him the value of his wine.</p>
<p class="bas indent2"><span class="nm">3.</span>(Reuven's donkey, which was carrying flax, died; Shimon's donkey was carrying wood, which is cheaper than flax.) Shimon should dump his wood and load the flax on his donkey; Reuven pays him the value of his wood.</p>
<p class="bas indent3"><span class="nm">i.</span>Yehoshua made the inheritance of Eretz Yisrael conditional on these enactments.</p>
<p class="bas subject"><span class="nm">6)</span>GETTING BACK WHAT WAS STOLEN</p>
<p class="bas indent1"><span class="nm">(a)</span><span class="cl">(Mishnah):</span> If Reuven recognized his Kelim and Sefarim with Shimon, and there were rumors that Reuven was robbed, Shimon swears how much he paid, and Reuven pays this and takes them back from Shimon.</p>
<p class="bas indent2"><span class="nm">1.</span>If not for the rumors, Reuven cannot force Shimon to sell them. Perhaps he sold them to the one who sold them to Shimon!</p>
<p class="bas indent1"><span class="nm">(b)</span><span class="cl">(Gemara) Question:</span> Why should we rely on the rumors? Perhaps Reuven sold them, and he started the rumors!</p>
<p class="bas indent1"><span class="nm">(c)</span><span class="cl">Answer #1 (Rav Yehudah citing Rav):</span> The case is, people were in Reuven's house at night; Reuven shouted that his Kelim were stolen.</p>
<p class="bas indent1"><span class="nm">(d)</span><span class="cl">Objection:</span> Perhaps this was just a pretext to buy them back!</p>
<p class="bas indent1"><span class="nm">(e)</span><span class="cl">Answer #2 (Rav Kahana citing Rav):</span> A tunnel was dug going out from the house. People who had spent the night by Reuven left with bundles of Kelim on their shoulders, and people were saying 'Reuven's Kelim were stolen!'</p>
<p class="bas indent1"><span class="nm">(f)</span><span class="cl">Question:</span> Perhaps they stole only Kelim, but not Sefarim!</p>
<p class="bas indent1"><span class="nm">(g)</span><span class="cl">Answer (R. Chiya bar Aba):</span> People were saying 'Reuven's Kelim and Sefarim were stolen!'</p>
<p class="bas indent1"><span class="nm">(h)</span><span class="cl">Question:</span> Perhaps they stole only small Sefarim, but Reuven claims big Sefarim!</p>
<p class="bas indent1"><span class="nm">(i)</span><span class="cl">Answer (R. Yosi bar Chanina):</span> They were saying which Sefarim were stolen.</p>
<p class="bas indent1"><span class="nm">(j)</span><span class="cl">Question:</span> Perhaps they stole old Kelim, but Reuven claims new ones!</p>
<p class="bas indent1"><span class="nm">(k)</span><span class="cl">Answer (Rav):</span> The case is, people were saying 'these are Reuven's Kelim and Sefarim!' (they recognized that they are new).</p>
<p class="bas indent1"><span class="nm">(l)</span><span class="cl">Question:</span> Rav cannot establish the Mishnah to be when thieves left through a tunnel!</p>
<p class="bas indent2"><span class="nm">1.</span><span class="cl">(Rav):</span> If a thief tunneled into a house and took Kelim, he may keep them.</p>
<p class="bas indent2"><span class="nm">2.</span><span class="cl">Question:</span> What is the reason?</p>
<p class="bas indent2"><span class="nm">3.</span><span class="cl">Answer:</span> When he was in the tunnel, he forfeited his life (anyone may kill him, for we assume that he is ready to kill the owner of the house. One need not pay for anything he does at a time that he is liable to die).</p>
<p class="bas indent1"><span class="nm">(m)</span><span class="cl">Answer:</span> That applies only to a thief who tunnels into a house, for he is prepared to confront and kill the owner (therefore, he forfeits his life). Here, the thieves only left through the tunnel.</p>
<p class="bas indent1"><span class="nm">(n)</span><span class="cl">(Rava):</span> The above answers refer to a man who sometimes sells his Kelim. If he does not, people need not see so precisely what was stolen.</p>
<p class="bas indent1"><span class="nm">(o)</span><span class="cl">Question:</span> Perhaps he needed money and sold his Kelim (even though he normally does not)!</p>
<p class="bas indent1"><span class="nm">(p)</span><span class="cl">Answer (Rav Ashi):</span> There are rumors that he was robbed (so we are not concerned lest he sold them).</p>
