<p class="bas subject"><span class="nm">1)</span>COMMANDS OF ONE ABOUT TO DIE</p>
<p class="bas indent1"><span class="nm">(a)</span><span class="cl">(Mishnah):</span> At first, if a man being taken out for execution said 'write a Get for my wife', we would write and give it;</p>
<p class="bas indent1"><span class="nm">(b)</span>Later Chachamim said that the same applies to one leaving to go overseas or into the wilderness;</p>
<p class="bas indent1"><span class="nm">(c)</span>R. Shimon Shezuri says, the same applies to a dying man.</p>
<p class="bas indent1"><span class="nm">(d)</span><span class="cl">(Gemara):</span> When Geneiva was being taken out for execution, he said 'give 400 Zuz to R. Avina from (my) wine of Nehar Panya.'</p>
<p class="bas indent1"><span class="nm">(e)</span><span class="cl">R. Zeira:</span> Rav Huna would rule that we give the money to R. Avina.</p>
<p class="bas indent2"><span class="nm">1.</span><span class="cl">(Rav Huna):</span> If a dying man gave a Get, it is like his command to give a gift: just like he can retract his gift if he gets better, he can retract a Get he gave;</p>
<p class="bas indent1"><span class="nm">(f)</span><span class="cl">R. Zeira:</span> Rav Huna would also say, just like it suffices if he says 'write a Get' without saying 'give', it suffices to say 'give a gift', even though witnesses did not acquire on behalf of the receiver.</p>
<p class="bas indent1"><span class="nm">(g)</span><span class="cl">Objection (R. Aba):</span> A Get and a gift are not the same in all respects!</p>
<p class="bas indent2"><span class="nm">1.</span>A gift can be given after he dies. You cannot say so about a Get!</p>
<p class="bas indent1"><span class="nm">(h)</span><span class="cl">Answer:</span> That is no comparison!</p>
<p class="bas indent2"><span class="nm">1.</span>A gift can be given after death. A Get cannot.</p>
<p class="bas indent1"><span class="nm">(i)</span><span class="cl">Correction:</span> Rather, R. Aba asked the following.</p>
<p class="bas indent1"><span class="nm">(j)</span><span class="cl">Objection (R. Aba):</span> Geneiva was like a Shechiv Mera (a sick person who fears lest he die) who gave away only part of his money. Such a gift requires an acquisition!</p>
<p class="bas indent1"><span class="nm">(k)</span><span class="cl">Question:</span> This implies that Rav Huna holds that it does not require an acquisition. We hold that an acquisition is needed!</p>
<p class="bas indent1"><span class="nm">(l)</span><span class="cl">Answer:</span> Geneiva was unlike a Shechiv Mera. He was sure that he would die!</p>
<p class="bas indent1"><span class="nm">(m)</span><span class="cl">Question:</span> This implies that R. Aba holds that such a gift requires an acquisition. We hold that no acquisition is needed!</p>
<p class="bas indent1"><span class="nm">(n)</span><span class="cl">Correction:</span> Rather, R. Aba asked the following.</p>
<p class="bas indent1"><span class="nm">(o)</span><span class="cl">Objection (R. Aba):</span> Geneiva did not say to give wine, nor money obtained by selling his wine. He said 'from my wine' (and this is meaningless)!</p>
<p class="bas indent2"><span class="nm">1.</span>Rav Huna holds that he said this to give R. Avina the upper hand (to collect from wine or money, in case one of them was lost).</p>
<p class="bas subject"><span class="nm">2)</span>AUTHORIZATION TO WRITE A <i>GET</i></p>
<p class="bas indent1"><span class="nm">(a)</span><span class="cl">(Mishnah):</span> If someone in a pit said 'whoever hears my voice, write a Get to my wife', people who hear him may do this.</p>
<p class="bas indent1"><span class="nm">(b)</span><span class="cl">(Gemara) Question:</span> We should be concerned, perhaps a Shed (demon, a being with similarities to angels and to people) said this!</p>
<p class="bas indent1"><span class="nm">(c)</span><span class="cl">Answer (Rav Yehudah):</span> The witnesses saw a human form.</p>
<p class="bas indent1"><span class="nm">(d)</span><span class="cl">Question:</span> Shedim can assume a human form!</p>
<p class="bas indent1"><span class="nm">(e)</span><span class="cl">Answer:</span> They saw his Bavu'ah (shadow).</p>
<p class="bas indent1"><span class="nm">(f)</span><span class="cl">Question:</span> Shedim also have shadows!</p>
<p class="bas indent1"><span class="nm">(g)</span><span class="cl">Answer:</span> They saw his Bavu'ah d'Vavu'ah (i.e. an extended, or especially dark, shadow -- see Pischei Teshuvah EH 17:49).</p>
<p class="bas indent1"><span class="nm">(h)</span><span class="cl">Question:</span> Maybe Shedim also have Bavu'ah d'Vavu'ah!</p>
<p class="bas indent1"><span class="nm">(i)</span><span class="cl">Answer (R. Chanina):</span> They have shadows, but not Bavu'ah d'Vavu'ah.</p>
<p class="bas indent1"><span class="nm">(j)</span><span class="cl">Question:</span> Perhaps a co-wife gave this command (intending to deceive and ruin her co-wife)!</p>
<p class="bas indent1"><span class="nm">(k)</span><span class="cl">Answer (Beraisa - Tana d'Vei R. Yishmael):</span> At a time of danger (e.g. he is prone to die and she will be an Agunah, i.e. unable to remarry), we may write and give a Get, even though we are not sure that the husband commanded it.</p>
<p class="bas indent1"><span class="nm">(l)</span><span class="cl">(Mishnah):</span> If a healthy man said 'write a Get to my wife', he is only teasing her (he did not say to give it).</p>
<p class="bas indent1"><span class="nm">(m)</span>A case occurred in which a healthy man said 'write a Get to my wife', went up to the roof and fell to his death;</p>
<p class="bas indent1"><span class="nm">(n)</span><span class="cl">R. Shimon ben Gamliel:</span> If he jumped off b'Mezid, the Get is valid. If the wind blew him off, it is Pasul.</p>
<p class="bas indent1"><span class="nm">(o)</span><span class="cl">(Gemara) Question:</span> The case brought contradicts the law taught!</p>
<p class="bas indent1"><span class="nm">(p)</span><span class="cl">Answer:</span> The Mishnah is abbreviated. It means that as follows: if we later see that he really wanted to give the Get, it is valid;</p>
<p class="bas indent2"><span class="nm">1.</span>A case occurred...</p>
<p class="bas indent1"><span class="nm">(q)</span>A man entered a Beis ha'Keneses and saw Reuven (a Rebbi of children), Reuven's son and a third man; he asked that two of them should write a Get for his wife. Reuven died before a Get was written.</p>
<p class="bas indent1"><span class="nm">(r)</span><span class="cl">Question:</span> Did the husband intend that Reuven's son may be his Shali'ach, considering that Reuven was there at the time?</p>
<p class="bas indent1"><span class="nm">(s)</span><span class="cl">Answer #1 (Rav Nachman):</span> One does not have such intention.</p>
<p class="bas indent1"><span class="nm">(t)</span><span class="cl">Answer #2 (Rav Papi):</span> One has such intention.</p>
<p class="bas indent2"><span class="nm">1.</span><span class="cl">(Rava):</span> The Halachah follows Rav Papi.</p>
<p class="bas subject"><span class="nm">3)</span>CAN A <i>SHALI'ACH</i> MAKE ANOTHER <i>SHALI'ACH</i>?</p>
<p class="bas indent1"><span class="nm">(a)</span><span class="cl">(Mishnah - R. Meir):</span> If a man asked two people to give a Get to his wife, or he asked three people to write and give a Get to his wife, they must write it and give it themselves;</p>
<p class="bas bbbline">66b----------------------------------------66b</p>
<p class="bas indent1"><span class="nm">(b)</span>If he asked three people to give a Get to his wife, they may tell others to write (and give) it, for it is as if the husband made them a Beis Din.</p>
<p class="bas indent2"><span class="nm">1.</span>R. Chanina of Ono testified that R. Akiva (who was imprisoned) also said so.</p>
<p class="bas indent2"><span class="nm">2.</span><span class="cl">R. Yosi:</span> We told R. Chanina that we have a tradition, that even if he asks the great Sanhedrin to give a Get, they cannot appoint someone else to write it, even if they will need to learn to write.</p>
<p class="bas indent1"><span class="nm">(c)</span>If a man told 10 people to write and give a Get to his wife, it suffices that one writes and two sign;</p>
<p class="bas indent2"><span class="nm">1.</span>If he said 'all of you write', one writes and all sign it;</p>
<p class="bas indent2"><span class="nm">2.</span>Therefore, if one of them died before signing, the Get is Pasul.</p>
<p class="bas indent1"><span class="nm">(d)</span><span class="cl">(Gemara - R. Yirmeyah bar Aba) Question:</span> If a man asked two people to write and give a Get to his wife, and they asked a scribe to write it, and they signed it, what is the law?</p>
<p class="bas indent1"><span class="nm">(e)</span><span class="cl">Answer (Shmuel):</span> If she remarried relying on this Get, she must leave her new husband. This law requires investigation.</p>
<p class="bas indent1"><span class="nm">(f)</span><span class="cl">Question:</span> Why did he say that this must be investigated?</p>
<p class="bas indent2"><span class="nm">1.</span><span class="cl">Suggestion:</span> Shmuel is unsure whether or not Mili can be transferred to another Shali'ach. (Mili is a mission in which the Shali'ach did not receive something needed for the mission. Some say that it is a mission that does not finish the matter, or depends on the consent of someone else.)</p>
<p class="bas indent2"><span class="nm">2.</span><span class="cl">Rejection:</span> Shmuel cited Rebbi to say that the Halachah follows R. Yosi, that Mili cannot be transferred to another Shali'ach!</p>
<p class="bas indent1"><span class="nm">(g)</span><span class="cl">Answer:</span> Shmuel is unsure what the husband meant when he said 'write'. Did he mean that they should sign the Get, or that they should write it?</p>
<p class="bas indent1"><span class="nm">(h)</span><span class="cl">Question:</span> He should learn from our Mishnah!</p>
<p class="bas indent2"><span class="nm">1.</span><span class="cl">(Mishnah):</span> If a man asked two people to give a Get to his wife, or three people to write and give it, they must write it and give it themselves.</p>
<p class="bas indent1"><span class="nm">(i)</span><span class="cl">Answer:</span> Shmuel is unsure about what the Mishnah means. Does 'they must write it' mean that they must sign it, or that they must write the Get itself?</p>
<p class="bas indent1"><span class="nm">(j)</span><span class="cl">Question:</span> Obviously, it means writing the Get itself! In the Reisha, R. Yosi says that if he asked the great Sanhedrin to give a Get, they cannot appoint someone else to write it, even if this necessitates that they learn to write.</p>
<p class="bas indent2"><span class="nm">1.</span>We can understand this if he means that they must write the Get itself. However, could you find a Sanhedrin that does not know how to sign?!</p>
<p class="bas indent1"><span class="nm">(k)</span><span class="cl">Answer:</span> Yes! Perhaps a new Beis Din does not know how to sign.</p>
<p class="bas indent1"><span class="nm">(l)</span><span class="cl">Question:</span> Shmuel holds that if 'write' means to sign, they can ask another to write the Get. Shmuel rules like R. Yosi, that Mili cannot be transferred to another Shali'ach!</p>
<p class="bas indent1"><span class="nm">(m)</span><span class="cl">Answer:</span> If 'write' means to sign, perforce the man wanted them to ask another person to write the Get. It is as if he told them to appoint another person to write it;</p>
<p class="bas indent2"><span class="nm">1.</span>R. Yosi agrees that Reuven may tell Shimon 'appoint a Shali'ach for me.'</p>
<p class="bas indent1"><span class="nm">(n)</span><span class="cl">Question:</span> R. Yosi does not agree to this!</p>
<p class="bas indent2"><span class="nm">1.</span><span class="cl">(Mishnah):</span> A Get written by a scribe and signed by one witness is valid;</p>
<p class="bas indent2"><span class="nm">2.</span><span class="cl">(R. Yirmeyah):</span> The text of the Mishnah says 'a Get signed by the scribe and one witness is valid,'</p>
<p class="bas indent2"><span class="nm">3.</span><span class="cl">(Rav Chisda):</span> The Mishnah is like R. Yosi, who says that Mili cannot be transferred to another Shali'ach.</p>
<p class="bas indent2"><span class="nm">4.</span><span class="cl">(Summation of question):</span> If R. Yosi agrees that Reuven may tell Shimon 'appoint a Shali'ach for me', this may lead to disaster!</p>
<p class="bas indent3"><span class="nm">i.</span>Sometimes, a man tells two people to ask a scribe to write a Get, and to ask two Ploni and Almoni to sign it. To avoid embarrassing the scribe (that he was not asked to sign it), they will ask him to sign for one of the witnesses, and the husband did not authorize this (so the Get is Pasul)!</p>
