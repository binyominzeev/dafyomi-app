<div class="subject"><span class="nm">1)</span><p>HEARING A SHOFAR BLOWN INTO A PIT</p></div>
<div class="indent1"><span class="nm">(a)</span><p><span class="cl">(Rabah):</span> If a person heard part of the note inside the pit and part outside, he is Yotzei.</p></div>
<div class="indent2"><span class="nm">1.</span><p>If he heard part of it before dawn and part after, he is not Yotzei.</p></div>
<div class="indent1"><span class="nm">(b)</span><p><span class="cl">Question (Abaye):</span> Why should there be any difference between the two cases - in both he heard part in a non-mandated way?</p></div>
<div class="indent1"><span class="nm">(c)</span><p><span class="cl">Answer (Rabah):</span> The night is not a valid time for Shofar at all, but the pit is a valid place for Shofar as far as the people in the pit are concerned.</p></div>
<div class="indent2"><span class="nm">1.</span><p>We see here that Rabah holds that it suffices to hear the end of the Shofar blast alone, and by inference to hear the beginning alone.</p></div>
<div class="indent2"><span class="nm">2.</span><p><span class="cl">Question:</span> We see that this is not so, as if the end Teki'ah was double-length, it still does not count as the first Teki'ah of the next set!?</p></div>
<div class="indent2"><span class="nm">3.</span><p><span class="cl">Answer:</span> The note has not been separated into two.</p></div>
<div class="indent2"><span class="nm">4.</span><p><span class="cl">Question:</span> "If someone blows a Shofar into a pit, cistern or barrel, then he is Yotzei if he hears the sound of the Shofar, but not if he hears the echo" - but why doesn't the first part of the note (before it combines with the echo) suffice?</p></div>
<div class="indent2"><span class="nm">5.</span><p><span class="cl">Answer:</span> Rabah meant that hearing part of it in the pit and part outside is valid for the one who blows; as he emerges, the sound is always in the same place as he is.</p></div>
<div class="indent3"><span class="nm">i.</span><p><span class="cl">Question:</span> If so, what is the Chidush?</p></div>
<div class="indent3"><span class="nm">ii.</span><p><span class="cl">Answer:</span> One might have thought that sometimes his head emerges before the Shofar does.</p></div>
<div class="subject"><span class="nm">2)</span><p>PERMISSIBLE TYPES OF SHOFAR</p></div>
<div class="indent1"><span class="nm">(a)</span><p><span class="cl">(R. Yehudah):</span> One should not use the Shofar of an Olah, but if one does so, one is Yotzei.</p></div>
<div class="indent2"><span class="nm">1.</span><p>One should not use the Shofar of a Shelamim, and if one does so, one is not Yotzei.</p></div>
<div class="indent2"><span class="nm">2.</span><p><span class="cl">Question:</span> Why the different rulings?</p></div>
<div class="indent2"><span class="nm">3.</span><p><span class="cl">Answer:</span> An Olah is subject to Me'ilah; once this has happened, it becomes Chulin. A Shelamim is not subject to Me'ilah and does not become Chulin; it simply retains its Isur.</p></div>
<div class="indent1"><span class="nm">(b)</span><p><span class="cl">Question (Rava):</span> He is only Mo'al the Olah after he has blown it; when it was blown, it was still forbidden!</p></div>
<div class="indent1"><span class="nm">(c)</span><p><span class="cl">Answer (Rava):</span> It must be that he is not Yotzei in either case.</p></div>
<div class="indent1"><span class="nm">(d)</span><p><span class="cl">Retraction (Rava):</span> In both cases he is Yotzei, as mitzvos are not for our benefit anyway (so there is no Me'ilah involved).</p></div>
<div class="indent1"><span class="nm">(e)</span><p><span class="cl">(R. Yehudah):</span> One should not use the Shofar of idolatry, but if one does so, one is Yotzei.</p></div>
<div class="indent2"><span class="nm">1.</span><p>One should not use the Shofar of an Ir ha'Nidachas, and if one does so, one is not Yotzei.</p></div>
<div class="indent3"><span class="nm">i.</span><p>The reason is that everything in an Ir ha'Nidachas is considered to lack any requisite measurement.</p></div>
<div class="indent1"><span class="nm">(f)</span><p><span class="cl">(Rava):</span> One who vows not to receive benefit from another may still have him blow the Shofar for his mitzvah.</p></div>
<div class="indent2"><span class="nm">1.</span><p>One who vows not to receive benefit from a Shofar may still blow it for his mitzvah.</p></div>
<div class="indent1"><span class="nm">(g)</span><p><span class="cl">(Rava):</span> One who vows not to receive benefit from another may have him sprinkle the waters of the Chat'as over him in winter but not in summer.</p></div>
<div class="indent2"><span class="nm">1.</span><p>One who vows not to receive benefit from a spring may immerse in it for the purpose of a mitzvah in winter alone.</p></div>
<div class="subject"><span class="nm">3)</span><p>FORCED MITZVOS</p></div>
<div class="indent1"><span class="nm">(a)</span><p><span class="cl">(Sent to Shmuel's father):</span> If a person was forced to eat matzah, he is Yotzei.</p></div>
<div class="indent2"><span class="nm">1.</span><p><span class="cl">Question:</span> Who forced him?</p></div>
<div class="indent3"><span class="nm">i.</span><p><span class="cl">Suggested answer:</span> A demon.</p></div>
<div class="indent3"><span class="nm">ii.</span><p><span class="cl">Rejection:</span> A Beraisa states that if a person suffers temporary insanity, he is rated as insane for those periods!</p></div>
<div class="indent2"><span class="nm">2.</span><p><span class="cl">Answer (R. Ashi):</span> He was forced by Persians.</p></div>
<div class="indent2"><span class="nm">3.</span><p><span class="cl">(Rava):</span> This shows that if one blows a Shofar for its music, one can also thereby fulfill the mitzvah.</p></div>
<div class="indent3"><span class="nm">i.</span><p><span class="cl">Question:</span> Obviously it shows this - it's the identical point!</p></div>
<div class="indent3"><span class="nm">ii.</span><p><span class="cl">Answer:</span> One might have thought that whereas the matzah consumption is the same in each case, a Shofar blown without intent for the mitzvah is not the Zichron Teru'ah required by the Pasuk.</p></div>
<div class="bbbline">28b----------------------------------------28b</p></div>
<div class="subject"><span class="nm">4)</span><p>KAVANAH FOR MITZVOS</p></div>
<div class="indent1"><span class="nm">(a)</span><p>We see from Rava's ruling about blowing a Shofar for its music that he holds that mitzvos do not require Kavanah.</p></div>
<div class="indent1"><span class="nm">(b)</span><p><span class="cl">Question:</span> We find that someone who reads the Leyning during the process of reading the Chumash is only Yotzei if he had Kavanah, presumably to be Yotzei!</p></div>
<div class="indent1"><span class="nm">(c)</span><p><span class="cl">Answer:</span> It means that he had Kavanah to read it.</p></div>
<div class="indent2"><span class="nm">1.</span><p><span class="cl">Question:</span> But he was indeed reading it!</p></div>
<div class="indent2"><span class="nm">2.</span><p><span class="cl">Answer:</span> He could be reading it for the purpose of checking it, which would only be a mumble.</p></div>
<div class="indent1"><span class="nm">(d)</span><p><span class="cl">Question:</span> We find that if someone was passing by a Shul and heard the Shofar or Megillah, then he is Yotzei only if he had Kavanah, presumably to be Yotzei!?</p></div>
<div class="indent1"><span class="nm">(e)</span><p><span class="cl">Answer:</span> It means that he had Kavanah to hear it.</p></div>
<div class="indent2"><span class="nm">1.</span><p>But he did indeed hear it?</p></div>
<div class="indent2"><span class="nm">2.</span><p><span class="cl">Answer:</span> He might have thought that it was a donkey braying.</p></div>
<div class="indent1"><span class="nm">(f)</span><p><span class="cl">Question:</span> We find that both the Shofar-blower and the listener must have Kavanah. The case of only the listener having Kavanah is surely where the person only blew it for its music - and he is not Yotzei!?</p></div>
<div class="indent1"><span class="nm">(g)</span><p><span class="cl">Answer:</span> It is referring to a case where the person did not intend to blow it for the requisite Shiur.</p></div>
<div class="indent1"><span class="nm">(h)</span><p><span class="cl">Question (Abaye):</span> If a mitzvah can be fulfilled even unintentionally, then someone who slept in a Sukkah on Shemini Atzeres should receive Malkus for Bal Tosif!?</p></div>
<div class="indent1"><span class="nm">(i)</span><p><span class="cl">Answer (Rava):</span> One can only transgress Bal Tosif during the period of obligation for the mitzvah.</p></div>
<div class="subject"><span class="nm">5)</span><p>THE CONDITIONS OF BAL TOSIF</p></div>
<div class="indent1"><span class="nm">(a)</span><p>The Gemara now discusses Rava's statement that one can only transgress Bal Tosif during the period of obligation for the mitzvah:</p></div>
<div class="indent1"><span class="nm">(b)</span><p><span class="cl">Question (R. Sh'man bar Aba):</span> We find in a Beraisa that a Kohen may not add on his own Berachah to the Berachos because of Bal Tosif, even though after he has said the requisite Berachos, it is no longer the period of obligation for the mitzvah!?</p></div>
<div class="indent1"><span class="nm">(c)</span><p><span class="cl">Suggested answer:</span> This is referring to a case where he had not finished the requisite Berachos.</p></div>
<div class="indent2"><span class="nm">1.</span><p><span class="cl">Question:</span> The Beraisa states that he did finish!?</p></div>
<div class="indent2"><span class="nm">2.</span><p><span class="cl">Answer:</span> He finished one Berachah, but not all of them.</p></div>
<div class="indent2"><span class="nm">3.</span><p><span class="cl">Question:</span> The Beraisa states that he finished all of them!?</p></div>
<div class="indent1"><span class="nm">(d)</span><p><span class="cl">Replacement answer:</span> This case has no set period for the mitzvah, since he can give Berachos whenever he finds a congregation, as we see from the following:</p></div>
<div class="indent2"><span class="nm">1.</span><p><span class="cl">(Mishnah):</span> If blood which requires four sprinklings was mixed up with that which requires only one (e.g. Bechor) -</p></div>
<div class="indent2"><span class="nm">2.</span><p><span class="cl">(R. Eliezer):</span> It should have four sprinklings, so as to avoid Bal Tigra; Bal Tosif can only be transgressed on a single item.</p></div>
<div class="indent2"><span class="nm">3.</span><p><span class="cl">(R. Yehoshua):</span> It should have one sprinkling, so as to avoid Bal Tosif; Bal Tigra can only be transgressed on a single item, and furthermore it is better to passively transgress Bal Tigra by <i>not</i> doing something, than to actively transgress Bal Tosif by doing something.</p></div>
<div class="indent2"><span class="nm">4.</span><p>Here, as soon as he has done one sprinkling, the Bechor obligation has ended, and yet there is still a problem of Bal Tosif, surely because since another Bechor could arise, the mitzvah is present all day!</p></div>
<div class="indent1"><span class="nm">(e)</span><p><span class="cl">Question:</span> Perhaps R. Yehoshua simply holds that Bal Tosif can even be transgressed outside of the time of the mitzvah!</p></div>
<div class="indent1"><span class="nm">(f)</span><p><span class="cl">Answer:</span> The intent is as follows: R. Sh'man bar Aba chose to ask from the Beraisa about Kohanim rather than from the Mishnah about blood, because in the Mishnah the Bal Tosif is due to the mitzvah being applicable all day - yet the same can be said for the Kohanim!</p></div>
<div class="indent2"><span class="nm">1.</span><p>R. Sh'man bar Aba's response is that it is an <i>obligation</i> to sprinkle blood if there is another Bechor, but there is no <i>obligation</i> for a Kohen to bless people again (so the time for the mitzvah has ended).</p></div>
<div class="indent1"><span class="nm">(g)</span><p><span class="cl">Rava (now providing an alternate answer as to why there is no Bal Tosif for sleeping in a Sukkah on Shemini Atzeres):</span> Although fulfilling a mitzvah does not require Kavanah, transgressing Bal Tosif with it does require Kavanah.</p></div>
<div class="indent2"><span class="nm">1.</span><p><span class="cl">Question:</span> Surely according to R. Yehoshua there was going to be Bal Tosif with the additional sprinkling even though there was no Kavanah!?</p></div>
<div class="indent2"><span class="nm">2.</span><p><span class="cl">Answer (Rava):</span> Transgressing Bal Tosif with a mitzvah does not require Kavanah if done during the time of the mitzvah, but it does if done beyond the time.</p></div>
