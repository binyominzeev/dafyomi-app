<div class="subject"><span class="nm">1)</span><p>CONSIDERING A WALL TO BE BENT</p></div>
<div class="indent1"><span class="nm">(a)</span><p><span class="cl">(Rabah):</span> R. Yehudah [who says that the Chatzer wall permits the pit] and R. Chananya ben Akiva agree with each other:</p></div>
<div class="indent2"><span class="nm">1.</span><p><span class="cl">(Beraisa - R. Chananya ben Akavya):</span> If a ledge [above water] is four Amos by four Amos, one may carve out a hole four by four Tefachim in the middle and draw water through it (10 Tefachim remain in every direction around it. We consider it as if what surrounds the hole was bent down, making a Mechitzah in every direction - see Perush Chai diagram, Perek 8 number 81, in the <a href=../chai/eruv-8chai081.jpg>English Charts</a> section. Rashba - we do not say Pi Tikra Yored v'Sosem because there is only one real wall, or because the ledge is sloped or does not have an even edge.)</p></div>
<div class="indent1"><span class="nm">(b)</span><p><span class="cl">Rejection #1 (Abaye):</span> R. Yehudah permits due to Gud Achis Mechitzta (there is a wall, and we extend it downward). He did not say that we bend to make a Mechitzah!</p></div>
<div class="indent1"><span class="nm">(c)</span><p><span class="cl">Rejection #2 (Abaye):</span> [On Amud b we will say that] R. Chananya permitted on top of Lake Teveryah, which is surrounded by steep banks, cities and Karfifos. (Mid'Oraisa it is Reshus ha'Yachid, and there is a Heker so people will not carry from Karmelis in other cases.) He did not permit elsewhere!</p></div>
<div class="indent1"><span class="nm">(d)</span><p><span class="cl">(Abaye):</span> According to R. Chananya, if a board [above water] is just within three Tefachim of a solid wall, it must be four Amos long and more than 11 Tefachim wide [to permit drawing water through it - one carves out in the middle [of the side facing the wall] more than a Tefach [to complete four Tefachim from the wall] along the length of four Tefachim along the board. We consider the remainder of the board to be bent down - the other long side is 10 tall and four Tefachim wide, the short sides are 10 tall and over one wide and Lavud to the solid wall, so they are considered to be four wide].</p></div>
<div class="indent1"><span class="nm">(e)</span><p>If the board is vertical [and within three of a wall], it must be 10 Tefachim tall and over six Tefachim wide [we consider over a Tefach on each end to be bent towards the wall, so they are Lavud; four Tefachim remain in the middle].</p></div>
<div class="indent1"><span class="nm">(f)</span><p><span class="cl">(Rav Huna brei d'Rav Yehoshua):</span> If a vertical board is near a corner, it must be 10 Tefachim tall and over two Tefachim wide. [We consider over a Tefach to be bent towards each wall. Through Lavud, each is four wide.]</p></div>
<div class="indent1"><span class="nm">(g)</span><p><span class="cl">Question (against Abaye (d)):</span> In the Beraisa, R. Chananya requires the board to be four Amos by four Amos!</p></div>
<div class="indent1"><span class="nm">(h)</span><p><span class="cl">Answer:</span> This is when [there is no wall nearby. It is supported on pegs;] it is like a [hollow] mortar. (One pounds into it.)</p></div>
<div class="subject"><span class="nm">2)</span><p>WATER THAT PASSES THROUGH A CHATZER</p></div>
<div class="indent1"><span class="nm">(a)</span><p><span class="cl">(Mishnah):</span> If a channel of water passes through a Chatzer, they may not draw water from it [on Shabbos] unless they made a Mechitzah 10 Tefachim tall where the channel enters and leaves [the Chatzer];</p></div>
<div class="indent1"><span class="nm">(b)</span><p>R. Yehudah says, the wall [of the Chatzer] over the water suffices.</p></div>
<div class="indent2"><span class="nm">1.</span><p><span class="cl">R. Yehudah:</span> A case occurred in which Chachamim sanctioned drawing water from a channel in Eivel! (They relied on the wall of the Chatzer.)</p></div>
<div class="indent2"><span class="nm">2.</span><p><span class="cl">Chachamim:</span> That was permitted because the channel was less than the Shi'ur [to be a Karmelis].</p></div>
<div class="indent1"><span class="nm">(c)</span><p><span class="cl">(Gemara - Beraisa #1):</span> They may not draw from the channel unless they made a Mechitzah where the channel enters <i>and</i> leaves. (Then it looks like the channel begins and ends in the Chatzer.) A Mechitzah in one of these places is not enough.</p></div>
<div class="indent1"><span class="nm">(d)</span><p>R. Yehudah says, the wall over the water suffices.</p></div>
<div class="indent2"><span class="nm">1.</span><p><span class="cl">R. Yehudah:</span> A case occurred in which a channel went from Eivel to Tzipori, and Chachamim sanctioned drawing water from it.</p></div>
<div class="indent2"><span class="nm">2.</span><p><span class="cl">Chachamim:</span> That was permitted because it was not 10 deep and four wide.</p></div>
<div class="indent1"><span class="nm">(e)</span><p><span class="cl">(Beraisa #2):</span> If a channel of water passes [through a Chatzer or Mavoy] under windows [of houses]:</p></div>
<div class="indent2"><span class="nm">1.</span><p>If it is less than three [Tefachim - this will be explained], one may not lower a bucket and draw water from it. If it is [at least] three, this is forbidden;</p></div>
<div class="indent2"><span class="nm">2.</span><p>R. Shimon ben Gamliel says, if it is less than four, it is permitted. If it is four, it is forbidden.</p></div>
<div class="indent1"><span class="nm">(f)</span><p><span class="cl">Question:</span> What must be less than three or four?</p></div>
<div class="indent1"><span class="nm">(g)</span><p><span class="cl">Answer #1:</span> The channel itself must be less than three or four.</p></div>
<div class="indent1"><span class="nm">(h)</span><p><span class="cl">Rejection:</span> Rav Dimi said in the name of R. Yochanan that a place less than four [by four Tefachim] cannot be a Karmelis. If Tana'im argue about this, he would have said so!</p></div>
<div class="indent1"><span class="nm">(i)</span><p><span class="cl">Answer #2:</span> (The channel itself is 10 deep and four wide. It is a Karmelis. It has banks below the Chatzer.) The Beraisa teaches that if the banks are narrow enough [they are Batel to the Reshuyos on each side, so] one may Machlif (transfer from the Chatzer to the banks, and then to the channel).</p></div>
<div class="indent1"><span class="nm">(j)</span><p><span class="cl">Question:</span> Rav Dimi said in the name of R. Yochanan that if a place [at least three Tefachim tall] is less than four by four [Tefachim], people of Reshus ha'Rabim or Reshus ha'Yachid may unload on it, as long as they do not use it to transfer [from one Reshus to the other].</p></div>
<div class="indent1"><span class="nm">(k)</span><p><span class="cl">Answer:</span> R. Yochanan forbids Chiluf between Reshuyos mid'Oraisa (for if one would directly transfer between them, he would be Chayav). The Beraisa permits between Reshuyos [for which the Isur to transfer between them is] mid'Rabanan. (E.g. one of them is a Karmelis, or. both are Reshus ha'Yachid.)</p></div>
<div class="bbbline">87b----------------------------------------87b</p></div>
<div class="indent1"><span class="nm">(l)</span><p><span class="cl">Question:</span> R. Yochanan forbids even Reshuyos mid'Rabanan!</p></div>
<div class="indent2"><span class="nm">1.</span><p><span class="cl">(Mishnah):</span> If a wall between two Chatzeros is 10 Tefachim tall and four Tefachim thick, the Chatzeros can be Me'arev individually, but not together;</p></div>
<div class="indent2"><span class="nm">2.</span><p>If there are Peros on top of the wall, people from either Chatzer may alight on the wall and eat them, but they may not take them down.</p></div>
<div class="indent2"><span class="nm">3.</span><p>If the wall was breached up to 10 Amos, the Chatzeros can be Me'arev individually or together, for it is like an opening;</p></div>
<div class="indent2"><span class="nm">4.</span><p>If it was breached more than 10 Amos, the Chatzeros can be Me'arev together, but not individually.</p></div>
<div class="indent2"><span class="nm">5.</span><p><span class="cl">Question:</span> If the wall is not four thick, what is the law [on top]?</p></div>
<div class="indent2"><span class="nm">6.</span><p><span class="cl">Answer #1 (Rav):</span> Since both have access to it [and it is too small to be a Reshus unto itself, it is Batel to both Chatzeros]. Neither may carry there at all;</p></div>
<div class="indent2"><span class="nm">7.</span><p><span class="cl">Answer #2: (R. Yochanan):</span> People from either Chatzer may bring food up and eat it [but they may not transfer].</p></div>
<div class="indent2"><span class="nm">8.</span><p>This is like R. Yochanan taught elsewhere:</p></div>
<div class="indent3"><span class="nm">i.</span><p><span class="cl">(Rav Dimi citing R. Yochanan):</span> If a place is less than four by four, people of Reshus ha'Rabim or Reshus ha'Yachid may unload on it, as long as they do not use it to transfer.</p></div>
<div class="indent1"><span class="nm">(m)</span><p><span class="cl">Answer:</span> Really, Ze'iri taught this last teaching [in the name of R. Yochanan].</p></div>
<div class="indent1"><span class="nm">(n)</span><p><span class="cl">Question:</span> According to Ze'iri, the Beraisa refutes R. Yochanan!</p></div>
<div class="indent1"><span class="nm">(o)</span><p><span class="cl">Answer:</span> Ze'iri holds that the Beraisa discusses the width of the channel. Tana'im argue about Rav Dimi's teaching (that less than four is not a Karmelis. If R. Yochanan indeed said it, he surely acknowledged that Tana'im argue about it.)</p></div>
<div class="indent1"><span class="nm">(p)</span><p><span class="cl">Question:</span> [Even if the channel is less than the Shi'ur for Karmelis when it enters the Chatzer, surely it is a Karmelis before this. Within the Chatzer] the channel should be like Chorei (holes open to) Karmelis [which are like Karmelis]!</p></div>
<div class="indent1"><span class="nm">(q)</span><p><span class="cl">Answer #1 (Abaye bar Avin and R. Chanina bar Avin):</span> (Chorei Reshus ha'Rabim are like Reshus ha'Rabim. Karmelis is a mere stringency mid'Rabanan.) We do not say that Chorei Karmelis are like Karmelis.</p></div>
<div class="indent1"><span class="nm">(r)</span><p><span class="cl">Answer #2 (Rav Ashi):</span> Even if we say that Chorei Karmelis are like Karmelis, this is only if they are close to the Karmelis. Here, the channel is far (Ritva - four Tefachim) from [where the channel is wide enough to be] a Karmelis.</p></div>
<div class="indent1"><span class="nm">(s)</span><p><span class="cl">Answer #3 (to Question (j) - Ravina):</span> The case is, there are walls on both banks where the channel enters and leaves [the Chatzer], and there is a gap between the walls;</p></div>
<div class="indent2"><span class="nm">1.</span><p>Chachamim hold like they taught elsewhere [that if the gap is less than three Tefachim, it is considered a solid wall due to Lavud], and R. Shimon ben Gamliel holds like he taught elsewhere [that Lavud applies to a gap less than four Tefachim].</p></div>
<div class="subject"><span class="nm">3)</span><p>LENIENCIES FOR PEOPLE OF TEVERYAH</p></div>
<div class="indent1"><span class="nm">(a)</span><p><span class="cl">(Mishnah):</span> If a balcony is above water, one may draw water on Shabbos only if he makes a hole in the balcony and a Mechitzah 10 Tefachim tall above or below [the balcony, and surrounding the balcony, or around the hole if it is at least four by four Tefachim - Rashi; Rashba - above means extending down from the balcony, and below means sticking up out of the water].</p></div>
<div class="indent1"><span class="nm">(b)</span><p>Similarly, if two balconies are one above the other, and a Mechitzah was made only for the top one, both are forbidden unless they Me'arev together.</p></div>
<div class="indent1"><span class="nm">(c)</span><p><span class="cl">(Gemara):</span> Our Mishnah is unlike Chananya ben Akavya!</p></div>
<div class="indent2"><span class="nm">1.</span><p><span class="cl">(Beraisa - Chananya ben Akavya):</span> If a ledge [above water] is four Amos by four Amos, one may carve out a hole four by four Tefachim in the middle and draw water through it. (We consider it as if the sides were bent down. We need not make actual Mechitzos!)</p></div>
<div class="indent1"><span class="nm">(d)</span><p><span class="cl">(R. Yochanan):</span> R. Chananya permitted on top of Lake Teveryah, which is surrounded by steep banks, cities and Karfifos. (Mid'Oraisa it is Reshus ha'Yachid, and there is a Heker so people will not carry from Karmelis in other cases.) He did not permit elsewhere. (Even so, our Mishnah is unlike R. Chananya, for it always requires Mechitzos.)</p></div>
<div class="indent1"><span class="nm">(e)</span><p><span class="cl">(Beraisa):</span> R. Chananya permitted three things to people of Teveryah:</p></div>
<div class="indent2"><span class="nm">1.</span><p>They may draw water through [holes in] ledges [above the lake, like we explained];</p></div>
<div class="indent2"><span class="nm">2.</span><p>They may wrap food in pods [of legumes. This will be explained];</p></div>
<div class="indent2"><span class="nm">3.</span><p>They may dry themselves with towels [after bathing. This will be explained.]</p></div>
<div class="indent1"><span class="nm">(f)</span><p><span class="cl">Question:</span> What did he permit regarding wrapping food in pods?</p></div>
<div class="indent1"><span class="nm">(g)</span><p><span class="cl">Answer (Beraisa):</span> If one rose early to bring pods:</p></div>
<div class="indent2"><span class="nm">1.</span><p>If he rose early in order that there will still be dew on them, the dew is Machshir (enables food to become Tamei. The seven liquids are Machshir only if one desired them);</p></div>
<div class="indent2"><span class="nm">2.</span><p>If he rose early to avoid losing time from his work, it is not Machshir.</p></div>
<div class="indent3"><span class="nm">i.</span><p>Normally, people of Teveryah intend to avoid losing time from work. (They are workers. Therefore, the dew on the pods is not Machshir.)</p></div>
