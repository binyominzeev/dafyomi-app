<p class="bas subject"><span class="nm">1)</span>WHO RECEIVED PORTIONS OF THE LAND?</p>
<p class="bas indent1"><span class="nm">(a)</span><span class="cl">(Rav Papa):</span> According to the opinion that shares were allocated to those who left Mitzrayim, we understand why Tzelafchad's daughters complained.</p>
<p class="bas indent1"><span class="nm">(b)</span><span class="cl">Question (Rav Papa):</span> According to the opinion that shares were allocated to those that entered, why did they complain? No sons entered to receive portions!</p>
<p class="bas indent1"><span class="nm">(c)</span><span class="cl">Answer (Abaye):</span> Nephews of Tzelafchad entered. Their portions reverted to their grandfather Chefer, and Tzelafchad's children deserved to receive a share of them.</p>
<p class="bas indent1"><span class="nm">(d)</span>According to the opinion that portions were allocated to those that left Mitzrayim, we understand why the tribes of Yosef's children complained. (Now, they had more people than left Mitzrayim, so they would receive less per person than the other tribes.)</p>
<p class="bas indent1"><span class="nm">(e)</span><span class="cl">Question:</span> According to the opinion that portions were allocated to those that entered, why did they complain? Everyone who entered received one portion!</p>
<p class="bas indent1"><span class="nm">(f)</span><span class="cl">Answer:</span> They had many men less than 20 years old who entered and received no portion.</p>
<p class="bas indent1"><span class="nm">(g)</span><span class="cl">(Abaye):</span> We may deduce that everyone who entered the land received a portion. If someone did not, he would have complained!</p>
<p class="bas indent1"><span class="nm">(h)</span><span class="cl">Suggestion:</span> Perhaps someone didn't receive a portion, but the Torah wrote only complaints (e.g. of Tzelafchad's daughters) that helped!</p>
<p class="bas indent1"><span class="nm">(i)</span><span class="cl">Rejection:</span> The complaint of the tribes from Yosef did not help, yet it was written!</p>
<p class="bas indent1"><span class="nm">(j)</span><span class="cl">Rejection of rejection:</span> That was written to teach good counsel, that one should beware of Ayin ha'Ra (envy).</p>
<p class="bas indent2"><span class="nm">1.</span><span class="cl">Support:</span> "Im Am Rav Atah Ale Lecha ha'Harah" - conceal yourselves in forests, lest an Ayin ha'Ra prevail over you.</p>
<p class="bas bbbline">118b----------------------------------------118b</p>
<p class="bas indent2"><span class="nm">2.</span>They responded 'we descend from Yosef, over whom Ayin ha'Ra does not prevail. In the Berachah to Yosef, it says "Alei Ayin (he has grace in the eyes of all that see him)".'</p>
<p class="bas indent3"><span class="nm">i.</span><span class="cl">(R. Avahu):</span> This may be read 'Olei Ayin' (his descendants prevail over Ayin ha'Ra).</p>
<p class="bas indent3"><span class="nm">ii.</span><span class="cl">(R. Yosi bar Chanina):</span> We can learn from "v'Yidgu la'Rov" - just like fish are covered in water, so no Ayin ha'Ra prevails over them, also Ayin ha'Ra does not prevail over Yosef's seed.</p>
<p class="bas subject"><span class="nm">2)</span>PORTIONS OF THE MERAGLIM</p>
<p class="bas indent1"><span class="nm">(a)</span><span class="cl">(Mishnah):</span> Yehoshua and Kalev received the portions of the Meraglim ...</p>
<p class="bas indent1"><span class="nm">(b)</span><span class="cl">Question:</span> What is the source for this?</p>
<p class="bas indent1"><span class="nm">(c)</span><span class="cl">Answer (Ula):</span> "Vi'Hoshua Bin Nun v'Chalev ben Yefuneh Chayu Min ha'Anashim".</p>
<p class="bas indent2"><span class="nm">1.</span><span class="cl">Suggestion:</span> Perhaps this means simply that they survived!</p>
<p class="bas indent2"><span class="nm">2.</span><span class="cl">Rejection:</span> Another verse says, "v'Lo Nosar Mehem Ish Ki Im Kalev ben Yefuneh vi'Hoshua".</p>
<p class="bas indent2"><span class="nm">3.</span>Rather, the verse means that they lived in their portions of the other Meraglim.</p>
<p class="bas indent1"><span class="nm">(d)</span><span class="cl">(Mishnah):</span> The complainers and Korach's congregation did not receive portions.</p>
<p class="bas indent1"><span class="nm">(e)</span><span class="cl">Contradiction (Beraisa):</span> Yehoshua and Kalev received the portions of the Meraglim, the complainers and Korach's congregation.</p>
<p class="bas indent1"><span class="nm">(f)</span><span class="cl">Answer:</span> The Tana of the Beraisa equates the complainers to the Meraglim. The Tana of our Mishnah does not.</p>
<p class="bas indent2"><span class="nm">1.</span><span class="cl">(Beraisa):</span> "Avinu Mes ba'Midbar" refers to Tzelafchad. "V'Lo Hayah b'Soch ha'Edah" refers to the congregation of the Meraglim. "Ha'No'adim Al Hash-m" refers to the complainers. "Ba'Adas Korach" is understood simply.</p>
<p class="bas indent1"><span class="nm">(g)</span><span class="cl">Question (Rav Papa):</span> The Beraisa equates the complainers to the Meraglim. Just like Yehoshua and Kalev received the Meraglim's portions, they should have received all (really, most) of Eretz Yisrael! (Most of Yisrael complained when they lacked water!)</p>
<p class="bas indent1"><span class="nm">(h)</span><span class="cl">Answer (Abaye):</span> 'The complainers' refers to those in Korach's congregation.</p>
<p class="bas indent1"><span class="nm">(i)</span><span class="cl">Question (Rav Papa):</span> According to the opinion that portions were allocated to those who left Mitzrayim, we understand "Chavlei Menasheh Asarah" (10 portions fell to Tzelafchad's daughters) - six from Chefer and his five brothers, and four of their own (from Tzelafchad, his brother, and Tzelafchad's double share of his father's inheritance);</p>
<p class="bas indent2"><span class="nm">1.</span>However, according to the opinion that portions were allocated to those that entered, there are only eight! There are six from Chefer and his five brothers, and two of their own (Tzelafchad's double share of portions that reverted to Chefer through Chefer's grandsons who entered Eretz Yisrael)!</p>
<p class="bas indent2"><span class="nm">2.</span><span class="cl">Counter-question:</span> According to the former opinion, it is really only nine (the Mishnah lists only three portions of their own. It does not say that Tzelafchad had a brother!)</p>
<p class="bas indent2"><span class="nm">3.</span><span class="cl">Answer:</span> You must say that Tzelafchad had a brother.</p>
<p class="bas indent1"><span class="nm">(j)</span><span class="cl">Answer:</span> We can likewise answer that Tzelafchad had two brothers!</p>
<p class="bas indent1"><span class="nm">(k)</span><span class="cl">Support (Beraisa):</span> "Nason Titen Lahem" refers to inheritance of their father; "b'Soch Achei Avihem" refers to inheritance of their father's father; "v'Ha'avarta Es Nachalas Avihen Lahen" refers to the extra share of the firstborn;</p>
<p class="bas indent2"><span class="nm">1.</span>R. Eliezer Ben Yakov says, they also received the portions of their father's brother(s) - "Nason Titen".</p>
<p class="bas indent1"><span class="nm">(l)</span>The opinion that he had two brothers learns this from "Achuzas Nachalah".</p>
