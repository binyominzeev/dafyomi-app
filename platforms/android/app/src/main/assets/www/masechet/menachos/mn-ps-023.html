<div class="indent1"><span class="nm">(a)</span><p><span class="cl">(R. Yochanan):</span> If oil was put on the Kometz of a Minchas Chotei, it is Pasul;</p></div>
<div class="indent1"><span class="nm">(b)</span><p><span class="cl">(Reish Lakish):</span> L'Chatchilah, one should rub the Kometz of a Minchas Chotei on the leftover oil from the Log brought for a (regular) Minchah, all the more so it is Kosher if oil was put on it!</p></div>
<div class="indent1"><span class="nm">(c)</span><p><span class="cl">Question:</span> It says "Lo Yasim Aleha Shemen v'Lo Yiten Aleha Levonah"!</p></div>
<div class="indent1"><span class="nm">(d)</span><p><span class="cl">Answer:</span> That forbids putting oil on it before Kemitzah.</p></div>
<div class="indent1"><span class="nm">(e)</span><p><span class="cl">Question (R. Yochanan - Beraisa):</span> If a Charev (Minchas Chotei or Minchas Sotah, which is not mixed with oil) became mixed with a Balul (a Minchah that is mixed with oil), we offer it;</p></div>
<div class="indent2"><span class="nm">1.</span><p>R. Yehudah says, we do not offer it.</p></div>
<div class="indent2"><span class="nm">2.</span><p><span class="cl">Suggestion:</span> The case is, the Kometz of a Charev became mixed with the Kometz of Minchas Nedavah.</p></div>
<div class="indent1"><span class="nm">(f)</span><p><span class="cl">Answer:</span> No, the case is, Minchas Nesachim for a bull or ram (which has two Lugim of oil for each Isaron of flour) became mixed with Minchas Nesachim for a lamb (which has three Lugim of oil per Isaron. The former is called Charev, for it is drier than the latter.)</p></div>
<div class="indent1"><span class="nm">(g)</span><p><span class="cl">Question:</span> Both of these are taught in the same Beraisa. Surely they are not the same case!</p></div>
<div class="indent2"><span class="nm">1.</span><p><span class="cl">(Beraisa):</span> If Minchas Nesachim for a bull or ram became mixed with that of a lamb, or if a Charev became mixed with a Balul, we offer it;</p></div>
<div class="indent2"><span class="nm">2.</span><p>R. Yehudah says, we do not offer it.</p></div>
<div class="indent1"><span class="nm">(h)</span><p><span class="cl">Answer:</span> Both are the same case. The Seifa explains the Reisha. (Even though the former is drier and absorbs from the latter, Chachamim are Machshir.)</p></div>
<div class="indent1"><span class="nm">(i)</span><p><span class="cl">Question (Rava):</span> If the oil of a Kometz was squeezed onto wood, what is the law?</p></div>
<div class="indent2"><span class="nm">1.</span><p>Are Chiburei Olim (things connected to something offered on the Mizbe'ach) considered like Olim; or not? (Rashi - if the Kometz is next to the oil, do we consider it as if the oil is inside, or is it considered Chaser? Alternatively - must we burn the wood with the Kometz (because the oil is still part of the Kometz, if it is not burned, the Kometz is Chaser), or not? Tosfos - he asks about a case in which some oil was absorbed and some is intact on the wood. Are they considered like one?)</p></div>
<div class="indent1"><span class="nm">(j)</span><p><span class="cl">Suggestion (Ravina):</span> R. Yochanan and Reish Lakish argued about this!</p></div>
<div class="indent2"><span class="nm">1.</span><p><span class="cl">(R. Yochanan):</span> If one is Ma'aleh (b'Chutz) a k'Zayis of meat including a bone (there is less than a k'Zayis of meat), he is liable;</p></div>
<div class="indent3"><span class="nm">i.</span><p>This is because Chiburei Olim (things connected to something offered on the Mizbe'ach) are considered like Olim;</p></div>
<div class="indent2"><span class="nm">2.</span><p><span class="cl">(Reish Lakish):</span> He is exempt. Chiburei Olim are not like Olim.</p></div>
<div class="indent1"><span class="nm">(k)</span><p><span class="cl">Rejection (Rav Ashi):</span> No. It is not clear how either of them would hold in Rava's case:</p></div>
<div class="indent2"><span class="nm">1.</span><p>R. Yochanan said that Chiburei Olim are like Olim only regarding a bone, for it is the same Min as meat, but wood (alternatively - oil) is not the same Min as a Kometz!</p></div>
<div class="indent2"><span class="nm">2.</span><p>Reish Lakish said that Chiburei Olim are not like Olim only regarding a bone, for if it came off the fire, there is no Mitzvah to return it, but oil would never come off the fire.</p></div>
<div class="indent1"><span class="nm">(l)</span><p>This question is not resolved.</p></div>
<div class="subject"><span class="nm">2)</span><p>WHEN IS MIN B'EINO MINO NOT BATEL?</p></div>
<div class="indent1"><span class="nm">(a)</span><p><span class="cl">(Mishnah):</span> If two Menachos became mixed together before Kemitzah:</p></div>
<div class="indent2"><span class="nm">1.</span><p>If one can take a Kometz from each of them by itself (e.g. they are mixed only in the middle, each is by itself on the side), they are Kesherim. If not, they are Pesulim;</p></div>
<div class="indent1"><span class="nm">(b)</span><p>If a Kometz became mixed with a Minchah before Kemitzah, we are not Maktir the mixture;</p></div>
<div class="indent2"><span class="nm">1.</span><p>If a Kohen was Maktir the mixture; the owner of the (Minchah that was) Nikmetzes was Yotzei, the owner of the other Minchah was not Yotzei.</p></div>

<div class="indent2"><span class="nm">1.</span><p>If a Kohen was Maktir the mixture; the owner was Yotzei.</p></div>
<div class="indent1"><span class="nm">(d)</span><p><span class="cl">(Gemara - Rav Chisda):</span> If a Neveilah became mixed with a majority of Shechutos (slaughtered animals), it is Batel, for a Shechutah cannot become (an Av ha'Tum'ah, like) a Neveilah. (Therefore, this is like Min b'Eino Mino.)</p></div>
<div class="indent2"><span class="nm">1.</span><p>If a Shechutah became mixed with a Neveilah, it is not Batel, for a Neveilah can become like a Shechutah (this is like Min b'Mino);</p></div>
<div class="indent3"><span class="nm">i.</span><p>When a Neveilah rots, it becomes Tahor.</p></div>
<div class="indent1"><span class="nm">(e)</span><p><span class="cl">(R. Chanina):</span> If the Batel (minority) can become like the Mevatel (majority), it is not Batel. If the Batel cannot become like the Mevatel, it is Batel.</p></div>
<div class="indent1"><span class="nm">(f)</span><p><span class="cl">Question:</span> Like which Tana are these teachings?</p></div>
<div class="indent2"><span class="nm">1.</span><p>They are not like Chachamim. Chachamim say that Olim are not Mevatel each other, but Min b'Mino is Batel (whether or not one can become like the other)!</p></div>
<div class="indent2"><span class="nm">2.</span><p>They are not like R. Yehudah, for he says that Bitul depends on the appearance (22a, Dam Par cannot be Mevatel Dam Sa'ir, even though neither can become like the other). Min b'Mino is never Batel, whether or not one can become like the other!</p></div>
<div class="bbbline">23b----------------------------------------23b</p></div>
<div class="indent1"><span class="nm">(g)</span><p><span class="cl">Answer:</span> They are like R. Chiya:</p></div>
<div class="indent2"><span class="nm">1.</span><p><span class="cl">(Beraisa - R. Chiya):</span> If Shechutos and Neveilos became mixed, one of these (if it is the majority) is Mevatel the other. (Rashba - if either could be Mevatel the other, whether or not it can become like the other, R. Chiya would have said Stam 'Min b'Mino is Batel', without specifying Neveilos and slaughtered animals.)</p></div>
<div class="indent1"><span class="nm">(h)</span><p><span class="cl">Question:</span> Which Tana does R. Chiya hold like?</p></div>
<div class="indent2"><span class="nm">1.</span><p>He is not like Chachamim. Chachamim say that Olim are not Mevatel each other, but Min b'Mino is (always) Batel!</p></div>
<div class="indent2"><span class="nm">2.</span><p>He is not like R. Yehudah, for he says that Min b'Mino is not (ever) Batel!</p></div>
<div class="indent1"><span class="nm">(i)</span><p><span class="cl">Answer:</span> He is like R. Yehudah. Really, R. Yehudah says that Min b'Mino is not Batel only when one can become like the other, but if one cannot become like the other, there is Bitul;</p></div>
<div class="indent2"><span class="nm">1.</span><p>Rav Chisda says that it depends on the Mevatel (if it cannot become like the Batel, there is Bitul);</p></div>
<div class="indent2"><span class="nm">2.</span><p>R. Chanina says that it depends on the Batel (if it cannot become like the Mevatel, there is Bitul).</p></div>
<div class="subject"><span class="nm">3)</span><p>WHO IS THE AUTHOR OF OUR MISHNAH?</p></div>
<div class="indent1"><span class="nm">(a)</span><p><span class="cl">(Mishnah):</span> If two Menachos became mixed together before Kemitzah, if one can take a Kometz from each of them by itself they are Kesherim. If not, they are Pesulim.</p></div>

<div class="indent2"><span class="nm">1.</span><p>Since both are Kesherim, we infer that the Shirayim are not Mevatel the Tevel. (We cannot infer whether the Tevel is Mevatel (pieces of) the Shirayim, for Chisaron after Kemitzah is not Posel.)</p></div>
