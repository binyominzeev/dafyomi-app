<p class="bas subject"><span class="nm">1)</span>WHO RECEIVED PORTIONS OF THE LAND?</p>
<p class="bas indent1"><span class="nm">(a)</span><span class="cl">Question (Rav Papa):</span> What does the verse ("Chavlei Menasheh Asarah") count?</p>
<p class="bas indent2"><span class="nm">1.</span>If it counts all brothers in Menasheh who received their father's portion, there were many more!</p>
<p class="bas indent2"><span class="nm">2.</span>If it counts only the heads of families, it should only count six!</p>
<p class="bas indent1"><span class="nm">(b)</span><span class="cl">Answer (Abaye):</span> Really, it counts the heads of families. It includes the other portions only to teach that Tzelafchad's daughters received the extra portion of a firstborn.</p>
<p class="bas indent2"><span class="nm">1.</span>This implies that Eretz Yisrael already belonged to Benei Yisrael before Yisrael entered (a firstborn does not receive an extra portion in property that his father did not own in his lifetime).</p>
<p class="bas indent1"><span class="nm">(c)</span><span class="cl">(Beraisa #1):</span> The children (of the Meraglim and of Korach's congregation) received portions from their grandfathers.</p>
<p class="bas indent1"><span class="nm">(d)</span><span class="cl">Contradiction (Beraisa #2):</span> They received portions in their own merit.</p>
<p class="bas indent1"><span class="nm">(e)</span><span class="cl">Answer #1:</span> Beraisa #1 holds that portions were allocated to those who left Mitzrayim. Beraisa #2 holds that they were allocated to those that entered.</p>
<p class="bas indent1"><span class="nm">(f)</span><span class="cl">Answer #2:</span> Both Beraisos hold that portions were allocated to those that left Mitzrayim. Beraisa #1 discusses children below 20 (when they entered Eretz Yisrael), and Beraisa #2 discusses children above 20.</p>
<p class="bas indent1"><span class="nm">(g)</span><span class="cl">(Mishnah):</span> He received two portions because he was a firstborn.</p>
<p class="bas indent1"><span class="nm">(h)</span><span class="cl">Question:</span> Chefer never received a share of Eretz Yisrael in his life. It was only <i>Ra'uy</i> (destined) to come to him. A firstborn gets an extra share of Muchzak property, but not of Ra'uy!</p>
<p class="bas indent1"><span class="nm">(i)</span><span class="cl">Answer #1 (Rav Yehudah):</span> He received an extra share of tent pegs (or other Metaltelin). Chefer was Muchzak in them.</p>
<p class="bas indent2"><span class="nm">1.</span><span class="cl">Question (Rabah - Beraisa - R. Yehudah):</span> Tzelafchad's daughters received four portions (of land) - "Chavlei Menasheh..."</p>
<p class="bas indent1"><span class="nm">(j)</span><span class="cl">Answer #2:</span> Rather, Eretz Yisrael already belonged to Benei Yisrael before they entered.</p>
<p class="bas indent1"><span class="nm">(k)</span><span class="cl">Question (Beraisa - R. Shimon ha'Shakmoni):</span> Moshe knew that Tzelafchad's daughters receive a part of Eretz Yisrael; but he didn't know whether they receive an extra share, for Tzelafchad was a firstborn.</p>
<p class="bas indent2"><span class="nm">1.</span>The Parshah of inheritance was fitting to be said through Moshe. Tzelafchad's daughters merited that it was said through them.</p>
<p class="bas indent2"><span class="nm">2.</span>Moshe knew that the man who gathered wood on Shabbos would be killed - "Mechaleleha Mos Yumas." He just didn't know which death penalty.</p>
<p class="bas indent3"><span class="nm">i.</span>This Parshah should have been taught (directly) through Moshe. The Mekoshesh was guilty, and it was written through him.</p>
<p class="bas bbbline">119b----------------------------------------119b</p>
<p class="bas indent2"><span class="nm">3.</span>This teaches that good things come through those with merit, and bad things come through unworthy people.</p>
<p class="bas indent2"><span class="nm">4.</span><span class="cl">(Summation of question):</span> If they owned Eretz Yisrael before entering, why was Moshe unsure?!</p>
<p class="bas indent1"><span class="nm">(l)</span><span class="cl">Answer:</span> Moshe was unsure whether they already owned Eretz Yisrael!</p>
<p class="bas indent2"><span class="nm">1.</span>It says "v'Nosati Osah Lachem <i>Morasha</i> (something you bequeath)." Is it <i>also</i> an inheritance (and the firstborn gets double)? Or, does this teach only that the parents bequeath but do not inherit?</p>
<p class="bas indent1"><span class="nm">(m)</span>Hash-m revealed to Moshe that it is also an inheritance.</p>
<p class="bas indent1"><span class="nm">(n)</span>"Tevi'emo (Hash-m will bring <i>him</i>, i.e. the congregation of Yisrael) v'Sita'emo b'Har Nachalsecha" - Benei Yisrael (who walked through Yam Suf) prophesized, without recognizing the prophecy (that they themselves will not enter Eretz Yisrael; it does not say 'Hashem will bring <i>us</i>').</p>
<p class="bas subject"><span class="nm">2)</span>TZELAFCHAD'S DAUGHTERS</p>
<p class="bas indent1"><span class="nm">(a)</span><span class="cl">Question:</span> "Va'Ta'amodna Lifnei Moshe v'Lifnei Elazar ha'Kohen v'Lifnei ha'Nesi'im v'Chol ha'Edah" - can we say that they asked Moshe, and did not receive an answer, and then they went to ask Elazar ... and then the Nesi'im and the congregation?!</p>
<p class="bas indent1"><span class="nm">(b)</span><span class="cl">Answer #1 (R. Yoshiyah):</span> The verse is written out of order (first they came before the congregation, then before the Nesi'im, then Elazar, then Moshe).</p>
<p class="bas indent1"><span class="nm">(c)</span><span class="cl">Answer #2 (Aba Chanan):</span> They were all sitting in the Beis Medrash, and they came before all of them at once.</p>
<p class="bas indent1"><span class="nm">(d)</span><span class="cl">Question:</span> What do they argue about?</p>
<p class="bas indent1"><span class="nm">(e)</span><span class="cl">Answer:</span> Aba Chanan holds that one may honor a Talmid in front of his Rebbi (i.e. they addressed their question to all present, even though the others were Moshe's Talimidim), and R. Yoshiyah forbids.</p>
<p class="bas indent2"><span class="nm">1.</span>The law is, one may honor a Talmid in front of his Rebbi.</p>
<p class="bas indent2"><span class="nm">2.</span>The law is, one may not honor a Talmid in front of his Rebbi.</p>
<p class="bas indent2"><span class="nm">3.</span><span class="cl">Question:</span> This is a contradiction!</p>
<p class="bas indent2"><span class="nm">4.</span><span class="cl">Answer:</span> The laws discuss different cases.</p>
<p class="bas indent3"><span class="nm">i.</span>One may honor a Talmid in front of his Rebbi only if the Rebbi himself honors the Talmid.</p>
<p class="bas indent1"><span class="nm">(f)</span><span class="cl">(Beraisa):</span> Tzelafchad's daughters were Chachamos, and able to expound, and righteous;</p>
<p class="bas indent1"><span class="nm">(g)</span>We know that they were Chachamos because they spoke at the proper time.</p>
<p class="bas indent2"><span class="nm">1.</span><span class="cl">(Rav Shmuel bar Rav Yitzchak):</span> Moshe was expounding the Parshah of Yibum. They said 'if we are like a son, we should get an inheritance. If not, our mother should do Yibum.' "Va'Yakriv Moshe Es Mishpatan Lifnei Hash-m".</p>
<p class="bas indent1"><span class="nm">(h)</span>They were able to expound - 'had our father left a son, we would not request an inheritance.'</p>
<p class="bas indent2"><span class="nm">1.</span><span class="cl">Question (Beraisa):</span> ('Had our father left a) daughter, (we would not request an inheritance.')</p>
<p class="bas indent2"><span class="nm">2.</span><span class="cl">Rejection (R. Yirmiyah):</span> The text of this Beraisa is mistaken (he did leave daughters! Had he left another daughter, they would all inherit together)!</p>
<p class="bas indent2"><span class="nm">3.</span><span class="cl">Answer (Abaye):</span> We can explain the Beraisa. 'Even if our father had left a daughter <i>to a son</i>, we would not request.'</p>
<p class="bas indent1"><span class="nm">(i)</span>They were righteous - they married only men fitting for them.</p>
<p class="bas indent2"><span class="nm">1.</span><span class="cl">(Beraisa - R. Eliezer Ben Yakov):</span> Each of them was at least 40 years old when she married.</p>
<p class="bas indent2"><span class="nm">2.</span><span class="cl">Question:</span> Rav Chisda taught that a woman that marries before age 20 will bear children until age 60. If she marries at 20, she will bear children until age 40. If she marries at 40, she will not bear children.</p>
<p class="bas indent2"><span class="nm">3.</span><span class="cl">Answer:</span> Since they were righteous, a miracle was done for them and they were able to conceive, like Yocheved.</p>
