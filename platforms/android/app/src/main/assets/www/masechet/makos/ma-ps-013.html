<p class="bas indent1"><span class="nm">(a)</span>R. Yehudah says, the murderers paid rent to the Leviyim of the city;</p>
<p class="bas indent1"><span class="nm">(b)</span>R. Meir says, they did not pay rent.</p>
<p class="bas indent1"><span class="nm">(c)</span>R. Meir says, if the murderer used to have a position of authority, when he goes free (after the Kohen Gadol dies), he returns to it;</p>
<p class="bas indent1"><span class="nm">(d)</span>R. Yehudah says, he does not return to his old authority.</p>
<p class="bas indent1"><span class="nm">(e)</span><span class="cl">(Gemara - Rav Kahana):</span> They argue about paying rent in the six Arei Miklat mentioned in the Torah:</p>
<p class="bas indent2"><span class="nm">1.</span>R. Yehudah expounds "Lachem" - for Kelitah (but they receive no other free benefits);</p>
<p class="bas indent2"><span class="nm">2.</span>R. Meir expounds "Lachem" - for all your needs (including free rent).</p>
<p class="bas indent2"><span class="nm">3.</span>All agree that they pay rent in the other 42 Arei Miklat.</p>
<p class="bas indent1"><span class="nm">(f)</span><span class="cl">(Rava):</span> All agree that in the six cities they do not pay rent. Both expound "Lachem" - for all your needs;</p>
<p class="bas indent2"><span class="nm">1.</span>They argue about the other 42 cities. R. Yehudah expounds "va'Aleihem Titnu Arba'im u'Shtayim Ir" - the other cities are also Kolet;</p>
<p class="bas indent2"><span class="nm">2.</span>R. Meir expounds "va'Aleihem Titnu" - the other cities are also for all your needs.</p>

<p class="bas indent1"><span class="nm">(b)</span><span class="cl">(Beraisa - R. Yehudah):</span> "V'Shav El Mishpachto v'El Achuzas Avosav Yashuv" - (when a Yisrael slave goes free,) he returns to his family, but he does not return to the authority of his fathers;</p>
<p class="bas indent2"><span class="nm">1.</span>R. Meir says, he returns also to the authority of his fathers - "v'El Achuzas Avosav", like his fathers.</p>
<p class="bas indent1"><span class="nm">(c)</span>The same applies to a returning murderer, for it says "Yashuv".</p>
<p class="bas indent1"><span class="nm">(d)</span><span class="cl">Question:</span> What does this mean?</p>
<p class="bas indent1"><span class="nm">(e)</span><span class="cl">Answer (Beraisa - R. Yehudah):</span> "Yashuv ha'Rotze'ach El Eretz Achuzaso" - a murderer returns to his family, but he does not return to the authority of his fathers;</p>
<p class="bas indent2"><span class="nm">1.</span>R. Meir says, he also returns to the authority of his fathers. We learn from a Gezerah Shavah "Shivah- Shivah" from a returning slave.</p>

<p class="bas subject"><span class="nm">3)</span>TRANSGRESSIONS FOR WHICH ONE IS LASHED</p>
<p class="bas indent1"><span class="nm">(a)</span><span class="cl">(Mishnah):</span> The following are lashed:</p>
<p class="bas indent2"><span class="nm">1.</span>One who has Bi'ah with his sister, with the sister of his father, mother, or wife, with the wife of his brother or paternal uncle, or with a Nidah (whenever he is lashed, she is also);</p>
<p class="bas indent2"><span class="nm">2.</span>A Kohen Gadol who has Bi'ah with a widow, any Kohen who has Bi'ah with a divorcee or Chalutzah, a Yisrael who has Bi'ah with a Mamzeres (one who was born (or descends from) a Bi'ah of Arayos forbidden by Kares) or Nesinah (a convert from the seven Kena'ani nations), or a Mamzer or Nasin who has Bi'ah with a Bas Yisrael;</p>
<p class="bas indent3"><span class="nm">i.</span>If a Kohen Gadol has Bi'ah with a widow who is a divrocee, he is liable for two transgressions (receives two sets of 39 lashes);</p>
<p class="bas indent3"><span class="nm">ii.</span>If any Kohen has Bi'ah with a divorcee who is a Chalutzah, he is liable only once.</p>
<p class="bas indent2"><span class="nm">3.</span>A Tamei person who eats Kodesh or enters the Mikdash;</p>
<p class="bas indent2"><span class="nm">4.</span>One who eats Chelev (forbidden lard), blood, Nosar, Pigul (Kodshim offered with improper intent) or Tamei Kodshim, or Chametz during Pesach;</p>
<p class="bas indent2"><span class="nm">5.</span>One who slaughters and offers a Korban outside the Mikdash;</p>
<p class="bas indent2"><span class="nm">6.</span>One who eats or does Melachah on Yom Kipur;</p>
<p class="bas indent2"><span class="nm">7.</span>One who prepares (scented oil according to the formula for the) Shemen ha'Mishchah (anointing oil) or incense (according to the formula for the incense offered to Hash-m, for his own use), or anoints with Shemen ha'Mishchah (the very oil used to anoint the Mishkan, Kohanim Gedolim, and kings);</p>
<p class="bas indent2"><span class="nm">8.</span>One who eats Neveilos, Treifos, Shekatzim u'Rmasim (insects or creeping creatures);</p>
<p class="bas indent2"><span class="nm">9.</span>One who eats Tevel, Ma'aser Rishon from which Terumas Ma'aser was not taken, or Ma'aser Sheni or Hekdesh which were not redeemed.</p>
<p class="bas indent1"><span class="nm">(b)</span>R. Shimon says, one who eats any amount of Tevel is liable (lashed);</p>
<p class="bas indent1"><span class="nm">(c)</span>Chachamim say, he is not lashed unless he eats a k'Zayis (an olive's worth).</p>
<p class="bas indent2"><span class="nm">1.</span><span class="cl">R. Shimon:</span> Don't you agree that one is liable for eating a (full) ant of any size?</p>
<p class="bas indent2"><span class="nm">2.</span><span class="cl">Chachamim:</span> That is because it is a full creation.</p>
<p class="bas indent2"><span class="nm">3.</span><span class="cl">R. Shimon:</span> A wheat kernel is also a full creation!</p>
<p class="bas indent1"><span class="nm">(d)</span><span class="cl">(Gemara):</span> The Mishnah lists Chayavei Kerisus, but it omits Chayavei Misos Beis Din. It is like R. Akiva.</p>
<p class="bas indent2"><span class="nm">1.</span><span class="cl">(Beraisa - R. Yishmael):</span> Chayavei Kerisus and Chayavei Misos Beis Din are both lashed;</p>
<p class="bas bbbline">13b----------------------------------------13b</p>
<p class="bas indent2"><span class="nm">2.</span>R. Akiva says, Chayavei Kerisus are lashed, for if they will do Teshuvah, Hash-m will pardon them from Kares;</p>
<p class="bas indent3"><span class="nm">i.</span>Chayavei Misas are not lashed, for even if they do Teshuvah, Beis Din kills them.</p>
<p class="bas indent2"><span class="nm">3.</span>R. Yitzchak says, the Torah taught that (all) Arayos are Chayavei Kerisus, and (superfluously) mentions Kares for Bi'ah with a sister;</p>
<p class="bas indent3"><span class="nm">i.</span>This teaches that it (and all other Chayavei Kerisus) are punishable by Kares, and not by lashes.</p>
<p class="bas indent1"><span class="nm">(e)</span><span class="cl">Question:</span> What is R. Yishmael's reason? (We are thinking that he obligates lashes for Chayavei Misos, even when the transgressor will be killed.)</p>
<p class="bas indent1"><span class="nm">(f)</span><span class="cl">Answer #1:</span> "Im Lo Sishmor La'asos Es Kol Divrei ha'Torah... v'Hifla Hash-m Es Makoscha";</p>
<p class="bas indent2"><span class="nm">1.</span><span class="cl">Question:</span> What does Hafla'ah refer to?</p>
<p class="bas indent2"><span class="nm">2.</span><span class="cl">Answer:</span> It refers to lashes - "v'Hipilu ha'Shofet v'Hikahu."</p>
<p class="bas indent1"><span class="nm">(g)</span><span class="cl">Question:</span> We should learn from "Im Lo Sishmor La'asos" that one is lashed for not fulfilling an Aseh!</p>
<p class="bas indent1"><span class="nm">(h)</span><span class="cl">Answer #1:</span> "Im Lo Sishmor" connotes a Lav;</p>
<p class="bas indent2"><span class="nm">1.</span><span class="cl">(R. Avin):</span> Wherever it says 'Hishamer', 'Pen' or 'Al', this is a Lav.</p>
<p class="bas indent1"><span class="nm">(i)</span><span class="cl">Question:</span> We should learn that one is lashed for a Lav she'Ein Bo Ma'aseh (without an action)!</p>
<p class="bas indent1"><span class="nm">(j)</span><span class="cl">Answer #1:</span> It says "La'asos."</p>
<p class="bas indent1"><span class="nm">(k)</span><span class="cl">Question:</span> We should say that one is lashed for a Lav she'Nitak l'Aseh (there is an Aseh to 'fix' transgressing the Lav)!</p>
<p class="bas indent1"><span class="nm">(l)</span><span class="cl">Answer (and Answer #2 to questions (g) and (i)):</span> Lashes are for transgressions like muzzling an animal (which it written next to the Parshah of lashes), which is not Nitak l'Aseh.</p>
<p class="bas subject"><span class="nm">4)</span>R. AKIVA'S REASON</p>
<p class="bas indent1"><span class="nm">(a)</span><span class="cl">Question:</span> What is R. Akiva's reason?</p>
<p class="bas indent1"><span class="nm">(b)</span><span class="cl">Answer #1:</span> "Kedei Rish'aso" - one receives only one punishment for his evil;</p>
<p class="bas indent2"><span class="nm">1.</span>R. Yishmael says, this teaches that one who is lashed or killed does not pay, but it does not apply to lashes and Misah, for this is like a protracted death (i.e. one punishment).</p>
<p class="bas indent1"><span class="nm">(c)</span><span class="cl">Question:</span> R. Akiva should exempt also Chayavei Kerisus from lashes due to "Kedei Rish'aso"!</p>
<p class="bas indent2"><span class="nm">1.</span>Granted, if they will do Teshuvah, Hash-m will pardon them from Kares. However, if we lash them before they do Teshuvah, this is a second punishment!</p>
<p class="bas indent1"><span class="nm">(d)</span><span class="cl">Answer (R. Avahu):</span> The Torah explicitly teaches that Chayavei Kerisus are lashed. We learn from a Gezerah Shavah "l'Einei (written regarding Kares for incest with a sister) -l'Einecha (written regarding lashes)."</p>
<p class="bas indent1"><span class="nm">(e)</span><span class="cl">Question (R. Aba bar Mamal):</span> If so, we should also learn Chayavei Misos from a Gezerah Shavah "me'Einei (written regarding idolatry) -l'Einecha"!</p>
<p class="bas indent1"><span class="nm">(f)</span><span class="cl">Answer:</span> We learn from "l'Einei" from "l'Einecha." We do not learn "me'Einei" from "l'Einecha."</p>
<p class="bas indent1"><span class="nm">(g)</span><span class="cl">Question #1:</span> A Gezeirah Shavah may be learned even from a different word altogether!</p>
<p class="bas indent2"><span class="nm">1.</span><span class="cl">(Beraisa - Tana d'Vei R. Yishmael):</span> (The Gezerah Shavah) "v'Shav ha'Kohen-u'Va ha'Kohen" equates the law (of a house with Tzara'as) when the Kohen (first) returns with when he comes (another week later).</p>
<p class="bas indent1"><span class="nm">(h)</span><span class="cl">Question #2:</span> We should learn "me'Einei" from "l'Einei" (Chayav Misos from Chayavei Kerisus) - these are no less similar than "l'Einei" and "l'Einecha", which are learned from each other!</p>
<p class="bas indent1"><span class="nm">(i)</span><span class="cl">Answer (Rav Shmuel bar Rav Yitzchak):</span> "Kedei Rish'aso" - one receives only one punishment <i>from Beis Din</i> for his evil.</p>
<p class="bas indent1"><span class="nm">(j)</span><span class="cl">(Rava):</span> All agree that one who is killed is not lashed. They argue only about one who was warned that he will be lashed for transgressing:</p>
<p class="bas indent2"><span class="nm">1.</span><span class="cl">Answer #2 (to Question 3:e):</span> R. Yishmael holds that one is lashed for a Lav that warns for Misas Beis Din (if he was warned for lashes).</p>
<p class="bas indent2"><span class="nm">2.</span><span class="cl">Answer #2 (to Question 4:a):</span> R. Akiva says that one is not lashed for a Lav that warns for Misah (since it cannot warn also for lashes).</p>
<p class="bas indent1"><span class="nm">(k)</span><span class="cl">Question:</span> If so, R. Akiva should likewise exempt Chayavei Kerisus from lashes (the Lav warns for Kares, and not for lashes)!</p>
<p class="bas indent1"><span class="nm">(l)</span><span class="cl">Answer (Rav Mordechai citing Rava):</span> Kares does not need a Lav. There is no Lav for Korban Pesach and Milah (circumcision), yet they are Chayavei Kerisus.</p>
<p class="bas indent1"><span class="nm">(m)</span><span class="cl">Question:</span> Perhaps the Lav (for the other Kerisus) is to obligate a Korban (for Shogeg)!</p>
<p class="bas indent2"><span class="nm">1.</span><span class="cl">Support:</span> There is no Lav for Pesach and Milah, therefore one who does not fulfill them does not bring a Korban (Chatas)!</p>
<p class="bas indent1"><span class="nm">(n)</span><span class="cl">Answer:</span> No, the reason they are exempt is (not because there is no Lav, rather,) because the Torah obligates a Chatas only for transgressions similar to idolatry, i.e. we are commanded to refrain. Pesach and Milah are Mitzvos to do an action.</p>
<p class="bas indent1"><span class="nm">(o)</span><span class="cl">Defense of Answer #1 (3:b - Ravina):</span> R. Akiva learns from "Kedei Rish'aso."</p>
<p class="bas indent1"><span class="nm">(p)</span><span class="cl">Reiteration of Question (c:1):</span> Before Teshuvah there is also Kares. Lashes is a second punishment!</p>
<p class="bas indent1"><span class="nm">(q)</span><span class="cl">Answer (Ravina):</span> Since he can avoid one punishment (by doing Teshuvah), this is not considered two punishments.</p>
