<div class="subject"><span class="nm">1)</span><p>MUST ONE INTERRUPT?</p></div>
<div class="indent1"><span class="nm">(a)</span><p><span class="cl">Answer #1 (Mar Zutra):</span> Perhaps Beraisa #2 is erroneous (it should say 'after nine and a half hours', like the simple understanding of Beraisa #1)!</p></div>
<div class="indent1"><span class="nm">(b)</span><p><span class="cl">Rejection (Mereimar):</span> A reciter of Beraisos said it in front of Rav Pinchas brei d'Rav Ami, and he accepted it! (Surely, he had a solid tradition that it is correct - otherwise, we could say that Rav Papa argues with him!)</p></div>
<div class="indent1"><span class="nm">(c)</span><p><span class="cl">Question:</span> If so, Beraisa #2 refutes Rav Papa!</p></div>
<div class="indent1"><span class="nm">(d)</span><p><span class="cl">Answer:</span> Indeed, [it does -] we must answer like Rav Huna (see note in Appendix).</p></div>
<div class="indent1"><span class="nm">(e)</span><p><span class="cl">Question (against Rav Huna):</span> R. Yirmeyah taught that the Halachah follows R. Yehudah regarding Erev Pesach, and the Halachah follows R. Yosi regarding Erev Shabbos;</p></div>
<div class="indent2"><span class="nm">1.</span><p>This implies that they argue about both of them!</p></div>
<div class="indent1"><span class="nm">(f)</span><p><span class="cl">Answer:</span> R. Yirmeyah taught about whom the Halachah follows regarding interrupting:</p></div>
<div class="indent2"><span class="nm">1.</span><p><span class="cl">(Beraisa - R. Yehudah):</span> On Erev Shabbos [if one started eating when it was permitted, and it became dark,] he must interrupt (Rashbam - make Kidush; Tosfos - remove the table to say Birkas ha'Mazon);</p></div>
<div class="indent2"><span class="nm">2.</span><p>R. Yosi says, he need not interrupt.</p></div>
<div class="indent2"><span class="nm">3.</span><p>A case occurred, R. Shimon ben Gamliel, R. Yehudah and R. Yosi were eating in Ako; Shabbos came. R. Shimon ben Gamliel suggested to R. Yosi that they should be concerned for R. Yehudah's opinion.</p></div>
<div class="indent2"><span class="nm">4.</span><p><span class="cl">R. Yosi:</span> You always try to get R. Yehudah to agree with my opinion - why now do you try to get me to agree to his opinion (this is shameful to me)!</p></div>
<div class="indent2"><span class="nm">5.</span><p><span class="cl">R. Shimon:</span> If so (you do not agree), we will not interrupt, lest Talmidim see and the Halachah will be established like him.</p></div>
<div class="indent2"><span class="nm">6.</span><p>They did not leave until the Halachah was established like R. Yosi.</p></div>
<div class="indent1"><span class="nm">(g)</span><p><span class="cl">(Rav Yehudah citing Shmuel):</span> The Halachah does not follow R. Yehudah or R. Yosi - rather, one spreads a tablecloth and makes Kidush [then continues eating. Rashbam - really, he holds that the Halachah follows R. Yosi - he was extra stringent; Tosfos - he holds like the Beraisa on Amud B; spreading a tablecloth is in place of removing the table.]</p></div>
<div class="indent1"><span class="nm">(h)</span><p><span class="cl">Question:</span> But Rav Tachlifa bar Avdimi cited Shmuel to say that just like we interrupt for Kidush, we interrupt for Havdalah.</p></div>
<div class="bbbline">100b----------------------------------------100b</p></div>
<div class="indent2"><span class="nm">1.</span><p><span class="cl">Suggestion:</span> We interrupt by removing the table (they used to have a small table in front of each person; it was removed before saying Birkas ha'Mazon)!</p></div>
<div class="indent1"><span class="nm">(i)</span><p><span class="cl">Answer:</span> No, we interrupt by spreading a cloth.</p></div>
<div class="indent1"><span class="nm">(j)</span><p>Rabah bar Rav Huna visited the Reish Galusa's house; they brought a tray in front of him (Rashbam - at the beginning of the meal; Rashi - he was eating, and Shabbos came); he spread a cloth and made Kidush.</p></div>
<div class="indent1"><span class="nm">(k)</span><p><span class="cl">Support (Beraisa):</span> We do not bring a table [in front of a person] unless he already made Kidush; if a table was brought, he spreads a cloth and makes Kidush.</p></div>
<div class="subject"><span class="nm">2)</span><p>WHEN MAY ONE START?</p></div>
<div class="indent1"><span class="nm">(a)</span><p><span class="cl">(Beraisa #1):</span> They (R. Yehudah and R. Yosi, who argue about interrupting) agree that one may not start [to eat after the time of Minchah].</p></div>
<div class="indent1"><span class="nm">(b)</span><p><span class="cl">(Beraisa #2):</span> They agree that one may start.</p></div>
<div class="indent1"><span class="nm">(c)</span><p><span class="cl">Question:</span> We understand Beraisa #1 - they agree that one may not start on Erev Pesach;</p></div>
<div class="indent2"><span class="nm">1.</span><p>But when do they agree that one may start?</p></div>
<div class="indent2"><span class="nm">2.</span><p>They do not agree about Erev Shabbos - they argue about this!</p></div>
<div class="indent1"><span class="nm">(d)</span><p><span class="cl">Answer:</span> They agree that one may start before nine hours.</p></div>
