<p class="bas subject"><span class="nm">1)</span>IS LAND INCLUDED WITH TREES?</p>
<p class="bas indent1"><span class="nm">(a)</span><span class="cl">Objection:</span> R. Shimon does not hold like R. Akiva!</p>
<p class="bas indent2"><span class="nm">1.</span><span class="cl">(Beraisa):</span> If one was Makdish three trees spaced out like 10 trees spread over a Beis Kor (an area in which 30 Sa'im of seed are sown, i.e. 75,000 square Amos), he includes the land and trees between them;</p>
<p class="bas indent3"><span class="nm">i.</span>Therefore, he redeems them (with the land) according to the fixed rate for redemption of land, 50 silver Shekalim for a Beis Kor.</p>
<p class="bas indent2"><span class="nm">2.</span>If they are spread out more or less densely, or if he did not Makdish all three at once, he did not Makdish the land and trees between them. Therefore, he redeems them according to their value.</p>
<p class="bas indent3"><span class="nm">i.</span>Even if he later was Makdish the land and trees between them, he redeems the (first) trees according to their value, and the land according to 50 Shekalim for a Beis Kor.</p>
<p class="bas indent2"><span class="nm">3.</span><span class="cl">Question:</span> Who is the Tana of this Beraisa?</p>
<p class="bas indent3"><span class="nm">i.</span>It is not R. Akiva. He says that one sells generously, and all the more so he is Makdish generously (the land would be Hekdesh even if he did not Makdish all three at once)!</p>
<p class="bas indent3"><span class="nm">ii.</span>It is not Chachamim. They say that one sells stingily, but they admit (in the Mishnah) that he is Makdish generously!</p>
<p class="bas indent2"><span class="nm">4.</span><span class="cl">Answer:</span> It must be like R. Shimon.</p>
<p class="bas indent2"><span class="nm">5.</span><span class="cl">Question:</span> What is R. Shimon's opinion about selling?</p>
<p class="bas indent3"><span class="nm">i.</span>It is not like R. Akiva, for if so, all the more so he is Makdish generously!</p>
<p class="bas indent2"><span class="nm">6.</span><span class="cl">Answer:</span> He must hold like Chachamim, that one sells stingily;</p>
<p class="bas indent3"><span class="nm">i.</span>R. Shimon says that also he is Makdish stingily, and keeps land for himself.</p>
<p class="bas bbbline">72b----------------------------------------72b</p>
<p class="bas indent2"><span class="nm">7.</span><span class="cl">Summation of question:</span> R. Shimon said that the trees nurture from Hekdesh; we cannot answer (for Rav Huna, end of 71b) that R. Shimon holds like R. Akiva!</p>
<p class="bas indent1"><span class="nm">(b)</span><span class="cl">Answer #2 (to Question 3:e, 71b):</span> (Indeed, Rav Huna's law is even like R. Akiva.) R. Shimon addresses Chachamim according to their reasoning. I (R. Shimon) say that just like one sells stingily, he is Makdish stingily, and keeps land for himself;</p>
<p class="bas indent2"><span class="nm">1.</span>Granted, you say that he is Makdish more generously than he sells, but you should admit that he (is not as is generous as one who gives. He) is Makdish only grafted carob and sycamore stumps (for they will nurture from Hekdesh, but not pits,...)</p>
<p class="bas indent2"><span class="nm">2.</span>Chachamim disagree. They say that he is Makdish as generously as he gives.</p>
<p class="bas subject"><span class="nm">2)</span>REDEMPTION OF AN INHERITED FIELD</p>
<p class="bas indent1"><span class="nm">(a)</span><span class="cl">Question:</span> The Seifa is not like R. Shimon!</p>
<p class="bas indent2"><span class="nm">1.</span><span class="cl">(Beraisa):</span> Even if he was Makdish the trees, and afterwards the land, he redeems the trees according to their value, and the land according to 50 Shekalim for a Beis Kor.</p>
<p class="bas indent2"><span class="nm">2.</span>According to R. Shimon, the law should depend on the time of redemption (when it is all Kodesh), and the trees should be redeemed along with the land!</p>
<p class="bas indent3"><span class="nm">i.</span><span class="cl">(Beraisa - R. Yehudah and R. Shimon):</span> If Reuven bought a field from his father Yakov, and was Makdish it, and Yakov died, it is now considered an inherited field. (Its redemption is fixed. It is 50 Shekalim for a Beis Kor);</p>
<p class="bas indent3"><span class="nm">ii.</span>We learn from "Asher Lo mi'Sede Achuzaso" - redemption (according to the value) applies only to fields that were not destined to be inherited (but he would have inherited this field even if he did not buy it)!</p>
<p class="bas indent3"><span class="nm">iii.</span>R. Meir says, if Reuven bought a field from his father Yakov, and Yakov died, and then Reuven was Makdish it, it is considered an inherited field;</p>
<p class="bas indent3"><span class="nm">iv.</span>We learn from "Asher Lo mi'Sede Achuzaso" - a field that was not inherited when he was Makdish it. (He inherited this field. Before his father died, the field was due to return in Yovel). (End of Beraisa)</p>
<p class="bas indent3"><span class="nm">v.</span>R. Yehudah and R. Shimon did not need a verse for R. Meir's case. They expounded it to teach their case.</p>
<p class="bas indent3"><span class="nm">vi.</span><span class="cl">Question:</span> What is their source (when Yakov died before Reuven was Makdish it)?</p>
<p class="bas indent3"><span class="nm">vii.</span><span class="cl">Answer:</span> They hold (from reasoning) that it depends on the redemption. (At the first time it could be redeemed, it was inherited, so it is like an inherited field).</p>
<p class="bas indent1"><span class="nm">(b)</span><span class="cl">Answer (Rav Nachman bar Yitzchak):</span> Really, they hold that it does not depend on the redemption;</p>
<p class="bas indent2"><span class="nm">1.</span>They expounded the verse to teach their Chidush. Had it come only to teach like R. Meir, it should have said 'Lo Achuzaso' or 'Lo Sede Achuzaso';</p>
<p class="bas indent3"><span class="nm">i.</span>Rather, it says "mi'Sede Achuzaso" to teach that it was not even fit to be inherited.</p>
<p class="bas indent1"><span class="nm">(c)</span><span class="cl">(Rav Huna):</span> Grafted carob trees and sycamore stumps are considered trees, and are also considered land;</p>
<p class="bas indent2"><span class="nm">1.</span>They are considered trees, i.e. if one was Makdish or sold two (regular) trees and one of these, the land between them is included;</p>
<p class="bas indent2"><span class="nm">2.</span>They are considered land, i.e. they are not sold along with the land.</p>
<p class="bas indent1"><span class="nm">(d)</span><span class="cl">(Rav Huna):</span> A sheaf the size of two Sa'im is considered a sheaf, and also a stack.</p>
<p class="bas indent2"><span class="nm">1.</span>It is considered a sheaf, i.e. two sheaves are Shichchah (if one forgot to harvest them, one may not return to take them), if this big sheaf was forgotten with them, they are not Shichchah;</p>
<p class="bas indent2"><span class="nm">2.</span>It is considered a stack, i.e. it itself is never Shichchah.</p>
<p class="bas indent3"><span class="nm">i.</span><span class="cl">(Mishnah):</span> If one forgot a sheaf that is Sa'atayim, it is not Shichchah.</p>
<p class="bas indent1"><span class="nm">(e)</span><span class="cl">(Rabah bar bar Chanah):</span> If one was Makdish a field, R. Menachem b'Rebbi Yosi and Chachamim argue about whether or not grafted carob and sycamore stumps are included.</p>
<p class="bas indent1"><span class="nm">(f)</span><span class="cl">Question:</span> Why didn't he say that R. Shimon and Chachamim argue about this?</p>
<p class="bas indent1"><span class="nm">(g)</span><span class="cl">Answer:</span> He teaches that R. Menachem b'Rebbi Yosi holds like R. Shimon.</p>
