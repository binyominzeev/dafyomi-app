<div class="subject"><span class="nm">1)</span><p>DOES ONE PAY OR SUFFER LASHES? (cont.)</p></div>
<div class="indent1"><span class="nm">(a)</span><p><span class="cl">Answer #1 (Ula):</span> In our Mishnah his sister is a Na'arah, so he pays. In Mishnah #1 she is a Bogeres, so he is lashed.</p></div>
<div class="indent1"><span class="nm">(b)</span><p><span class="cl">Objection:</span> Also for a Bogeres one pays for embarrassment and blemish!</p></div>
<div class="indent1"><span class="nm">(c)</span><p><span class="cl">Answer:</span> The case is, she is insane (so these payments do not apply).</p></div>
<div class="indent1"><span class="nm">(d)</span><p><span class="cl">Objection:</span> There is payment for pain!</p></div>
<div class="indent1"><span class="nm">(e)</span><p><span class="cl">Answer:</span> The Mishnah discusses (only) a seducer.</p></div>
<div class="indent2"><span class="nm">1.</span><p>This suggests another answer to the contradiction.</p></div>
<div class="indent1"><span class="nm">(f)</span><p><span class="cl">Answer #2:</span> Mishnah #1 discusses even a Na'arah. She is an orphan who was seduced, so she forgives all payments!</p></div>
<div class="indent1"><span class="nm">(g)</span><p><span class="cl">Inference:</span> Ula holds that if one is liable to pay and be lashed for one act, he pays and is not lashed.</p></div>
<div class="indent1"><span class="nm">(h)</span><p><span class="cl">Question:</span> What is Ula's source?</p></div>
<div class="indent1"><span class="nm">(i)</span><p><span class="cl">Answer #1:</span> He learns from one who strikes someone. (Even though one is lashed for this when the damage was less than a Perutah, when the damage is a Perutah) he only pays. We learn to all such cases.</p></div>
<div class="indent1"><span class="nm">(j)</span><p><span class="cl">Rejection #1:</span> (If paying is a harsher punishment than lashes) perhaps only one who strikes someone pays, since the Torah is stringent about this and obligates five payments!</p></div>
<div class="indent1"><span class="nm">(k)</span><p><span class="cl">Rejection #2:</span> If paying is a lighter punishment than lashes, perhaps we are lenient about one who strikes someone, since Beis Din is permitted to strike people (so we cannot learn to other cases).</p></div>
<div class="indent1"><span class="nm">(l)</span><p><span class="cl">Answer #2:</span> Rather, he learns from Edim Zomemim (witnesses who testified about something that they could not have seen. Even though there are lashes for this, when they must pay) they only pay.</p></div>
<div class="indent1"><span class="nm">(m)</span><p><span class="cl">Rejection #1:</span> The Torah is stringent about Edim Zomemim. They are lashed without warning. We cannot learn to other cases!</p></div>
<div class="indent1"><span class="nm">(n)</span><p><span class="cl">Rejection #2:</span> If paying is the lighter punishment, perhaps we are lenient about Edim Zomemim, since they did no action!</p></div>
<div class="indent1"><span class="nm">(o)</span><p><span class="cl">Answer #3:</span> He learns a Tzad ha'Shavah (what is common) to both of these. They should pay and be lashed, but they only pay. We learn to all such cases.</p></div>
<div class="indent1"><span class="nm">(p)</span><p><span class="cl">Rejection #1:</span> We cannot learn from these two, for each has a special severity!</p></div>
<div class="indent1"><span class="nm">(q)</span><p><span class="cl">Rejection #2:</span> If paying is the lighter punishment, we cannot learn from them, for each has a special leniency!</p></div>
<div class="bbbline">32b----------------------------------------32b</p></div>
<div class="indent1"><span class="nm">(r)</span><p><span class="cl">Answer #4:</span> Ula learns from a Gezeirah Shavah.</p></div>
<div class="indent2"><span class="nm">1.</span><p>It says "Tachas" regarding one who strikes someone, and also regarding a rapist. Just like the former pays money and is not lashed, so too all other cases. (Tosfos - he learns only to a rapist.)</p></div>
<div class="subject"><span class="nm">2)</span><p>R. YOCHANAN'S ANSWER</p></div>
<div class="indent1"><span class="nm">(a)</span><p><span class="cl">Answer #3 (to contradiction 4:b, 31b - R. Yochanan):</span> One is lashed even for a Na'arah if he was warned. If there was no warning, he pays.</p></div>
<div class="indent2"><span class="nm">1.</span><p>R. Yochanan holds that if one is liable to pay and be lashed for one act, he is lashed and does not pay.</p></div>
<div class="indent1"><span class="nm">(b)</span><p><span class="cl">Question:</span> What is his source?</p></div>
<div class="indent1"><span class="nm">(c)</span><p><span class="cl">Answer:</span> "According to his evil" - he is punished for one evil, not for two. Adjacent to this it says "he will lash him 40 times."</p></div>
<div class="indent1"><span class="nm">(d)</span><p><span class="cl">Question:</span> One who strikes his friend pays and is not lashed!</p></div>
<div class="indent2"><span class="nm">1.</span><p><span class="cl">Suggestion:</span> Perhaps he pays only when there was no warning.</p></div>
<div class="indent2"><span class="nm">2.</span><p><span class="cl">Rejection:</span> R. Yochanan taught that if one inflicted a wound for which the compensation is less than a Perutah, he is lashed;</p></div>
<div class="indent3"><span class="nm">i.</span><p>We must say that he was warned, for otherwise he would not be lashed!</p></div>
<div class="indent3"><span class="nm">ii.</span><p><span class="cl">Inference:</span> If the compensation was a Perutah, he would pay!</p></div>
<div class="indent1"><span class="nm">(e)</span><p><span class="cl">Answer:</span> The Torah explicitly said that wounding is punishable by money, like R. Ila'a said regarding Edim Zomemim:</p></div>
<div class="indent2"><span class="nm">1.</span><p><span class="cl">(Mishnah - R. Meir):</span> If witnesses testified that Ploni owes 200 Zuz and they were found to be Zomemim, they are lashed and pay, since these punishments come from different verses;</p></div>
<div class="indent2"><span class="nm">2.</span><p>Chachamim say, since they pay they are not lashed.</p></div>
<div class="indent2"><span class="nm">3.</span><p><span class="cl">Question:</span> Why don't we say they are lashed and do not pay?</p></div>
<div class="indent2"><span class="nm">4.</span><p><span class="cl">Answer (R. Ila'a):</span> The Torah explicitly said that Edim Zomemim pay.</p></div>
<div class="indent2"><span class="nm">5.</span><p><span class="cl">Question:</span> Where did the Torah say this?</p></div>
<div class="indent2"><span class="nm">6.</span><p><span class="cl">Answer:</span> "You will do to him like he plotted to do to his brother. Yad b'Yad" refers to something that given from hand to hand, i.e. money.</p></div>
<div class="indent2"><span class="nm">7.</span><p>Similarly, regarding wounding it says "Like he did, will be done to him." "So he will give" is extra to teach that this means something that is given, i.e. money.</p></div>
