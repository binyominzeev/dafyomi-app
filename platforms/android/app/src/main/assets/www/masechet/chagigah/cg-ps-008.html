<p class="bas subject"><span class="nm">1)</span>FROM WHAT TYPE OF PROPERTY MAY ONE BRING <i>KORBANOS</i>? (cont.)</p>
<p class="bas indent1"><span class="nm">(a)</span>Beis Shamai and Beis Hillel argue whether the Chagigah of the first day of Pesach must be brought from Chulin (Beis Shamai) or may even be brought from Ma'aser (Beis Hillel).</p>
<p class="bas indent2"><span class="nm">1.</span><span class="cl">Question:</span> Why are they discussing specifically the Chagigah of the first day of Pesach, if the same applies to the Chagigos of all festivals?</p>
<p class="bas indent2"><span class="nm">2.</span><span class="cl">Answer:</span> They mention the Chagigah of the Fifteenth of Nisan to teach that the Chagigah of that day is mid'Oraisa, to exclude the Chagigah of the Fourteenth of Nisan, which is only mid'Rabanan.</p>
<p class="bas indent2"><span class="nm">3.</span><span class="cl">Question:</span> Why does Beis Hillel say that the Chagigah of the first day of Pesach may be brought from Ma'aser -- it is an obligatory Korban, and all obligatory Korbanos must be brought from Chulin!?</p>
<p class="bas indent2"><span class="nm">4.</span><span class="cl">Answer:</span> Beis Hillel is referring to a case of "Tofel" -- adding Ma'aser to one's Chulin in order to have more meat (Beis Hillel permits "Tofel," while Beis Shamai maintains that the entire Korban must come from Chulin).</p>
<p class="bas indent3"><span class="nm">i.</span><span class="cl">(Chizkiyah):</span> One may combine an <i>animal</i> of Ma'aser with an <i>animal</i> of Chulin (to serve as the Korban Chagigah so that a large family has more meat to eat), but not money of Ma'aser with money of Chulin (to bring one large animal).</p>
<p class="bas indent3"><span class="nm">ii.</span><span class="cl">(R. Yochanan):</span> One may combine <i>money</i> of Ma'aser with <i>money</i> of Chulin (to bring one large animal), but not an animal of Ma'aser with an animal of Chulin.</p>
<p class="bas indent3"><span class="nm">iii.</span>There are Beraisos which support both opinions.</p>
<p class="bas subject"><span class="nm">2)</span>WITH WHAT TYPE OF <i>KORBAN</i> MAY ONE FULFILL THE OBLIGATION OF <i>SIMCHAH</i>?</p>
<p class="bas indent1"><span class="nm">(a)</span>"You shall rejoice in your festival" (Devarim 16:14) teaches that one fulfills the Mitzvah of Simchah with all types of Simchah-inducing meats.</p>
<p class="bas indent2"><span class="nm">1.</span>This includes the meat of Korbanos Nedarim, Nedavos, and Ma'aser Behemah for a Yisrael.</p>
<p class="bas indent2"><span class="nm">2.</span>For a Kohen, this also includes the meat of a Chatas, Asham, Bechor, and the Chazeh and Shok.</p>
<p class="bas indent1"><span class="nm">(b)</span><span class="cl">Question:</span> Perhaps this also includes birds and flour offerings!?</p>
<p class="bas indent1"><span class="nm">(c)</span><span class="cl">Answer:</span> The verse emphasizes, "You shall rejoice in your festival (b'Chagecha)," meaning that your Simchah shall come from whatever animal the Chagigah comes from, which excludes birds and flour.</p>
<p class="bas bbbline">8b----------------------------------------8b</p>
<p class="bas indent1"><span class="nm">(d)</span><span class="cl">(R. Ashi):</span> The verse says, "You shall rejoice" -- the flesh of birds and flour do not bring a person to rejoice (while the meat of animals does).</p>
<p class="bas indent1"><span class="nm">(e)</span><span class="cl">Question:</span> What does R. Ashi do with the phrase, "[You shall rejoice] <i>in your festival</i>?"</p>
<p class="bas indent1"><span class="nm">(f)</span><span class="cl">Answer:</span> This teaches that during the festival, one may not marry, because the verse says that one must rejoice "in your festival" and not in your wife.</p>
<p class="bas subject"><span class="nm">3)</span><i>MISHNAH</i>: THE AMOUNT OF ANIMALS ONE BRINGS DEPENDS ON HIS PERSONAL CIRCUMSTANCES</p>
<p class="bas indent1"><span class="nm">(a)</span>One who has many people to feed (in his family), but little property, should bring many Shelamim and few Olos.</p>
<p class="bas indent1"><span class="nm">(b)</span>One who has few people to feed, but lots of property, should bring many Olos and few Shelamim.</p>
<p class="bas indent1"><span class="nm">(c)</span>One who has few people to feed and little property, for such a person the minimum values of one Me'ah's worth (of Olos) and two Me'ah's worth (of Shelamim) apply.</p>
<p class="bas indent1"><span class="nm">(d)</span>One who has many people to feed and lots of property, for such a person the verse, "every man according to what he can give, according to the blessing that Hash-m gave you" (Devarim 16:17) applies.</p>
<p class="bas subject"><span class="nm">4)</span>BRINGING LOTS OF ANIMALS AS <i>KORBANOS</i></p>
<p class="bas indent1"><span class="nm">(a)</span><span class="cl">Question:</span> How can one who has many people to feed, but has little property, bring many Shelamim?</p>
<p class="bas indent1"><span class="nm">(b)</span><span class="cl">Answer:</span> He is "Tofel" -- he combines Ma'aser with his Chulin to bring more animals.</p>
<p class="bas indent2"><span class="nm">1.</span><span class="cl">(R. Chisda):</span> He combines Ma'aser money with Chulin money to bring one big animal (like R. Yochanan on 8a).</p>
<p class="bas indent2"><span class="nm">2.</span><span class="cl">(R. Sheshes):</span> He may <i>even</i> combine Ma'aser animals with Chulin animals to bring many animals (a third opinion, not like Chizkiyah nor R. Yochanan on 8a).</p>
<p class="bas subject"><span class="nm">5)</span>WHAT TO DO IF ONE DID NOT HAVE ENOUGH TIME TO BRING ALL OF HIS <i>KORBANOS</i> ON THE FIRST DAY</p>
<p class="bas indent1"><span class="nm">(a)</span><span class="cl">(Reish Lakish):</span> One who separated ten animals as his Korban Chagigah, and only had time to bring five on the first day of Yom Tov, may bring the remaining five on the second day.</p>
<p class="bas indent1"><span class="nm">(b)</span><span class="cl">(R. Yochanan):</span> Since the day ended, he may no longer bring the remaining animals.</p>
<p class="bas indent1"><span class="nm">(c)</span><span class="cl">(R. Aba):</span> Reish Lakish and R. Yochanan are not arguing.</p>
<p class="bas indent2"><span class="nm">1.</span>Reish Lakish is referring to when the person specified that he separated all ten animals to be brought on the first day.</p>
<p class="bas indent2"><span class="nm">2.</span>R. Yochanan is referring to when the person did not specify that the animals were all meant to be brought on the first day.</p>
<p class="bas indent3"><span class="nm">i.</span>Furthermore, there was time left to bring them on the first day.</p>
<p class="bas indent3"><span class="nm">ii.</span>And he had family members to eat them as well.</p>
<p class="bas indent3"><span class="nm">iii.</span>The fact that he did not bring them shows that he intended all along to bring them on the second day (and thus there is a problem of Bal Tosif).</p>
