<p class="bas subject"><span class="nm">1)</span>WITNESSES WHO SAY THAT THEY SIGNED IMPROPERLY (cont.)</p>
<p class="bas indent1"><span class="nm">(a)</span><span class="cl">Summation of question:</span> Why does R. Meir say they are not believed to say that they were forced to sign?</p>
<p class="bas indent1"><span class="nm">(b)</span><span class="cl">Answer #1 (Rav Chisda):</span> He holds that witnesses should forfeit their lives rather than sign falsely.</p>
<p class="bas indent1"><span class="nm">(c)</span><span class="cl">Objection (Rava):</span> If they would consult with us, we would instruct them to sign and live. Why shouldn't we believe them?!</p>
<p class="bas indent2"><span class="nm">1.</span>One may transgress anything to save a life, except for idolatry, incest, or murder.</p>
<p class="bas indent1"><span class="nm">(d)</span><span class="cl">Answer #2 (Rava):</span> (The case is, the borrower admits that the document was valid, but he says that he paid.) R. Meir holds like Rav Huna:</p>
<p class="bas indent2"><span class="nm">1.</span><span class="cl">(Rav Huna):</span> If Shimon agrees that a document (that says that he owes Reuven) was written properly, Reuven need not prove that the signatures are valid. (We do not say that Shimon is believed Migo (since) he could claim that the document was forged.)</p>
<p class="bas indent1"><span class="nm">(e)</span><span class="cl">Rav Nachman (to Rav Huna):</span> You deceive people! If you hold like R. Meir, say that the Halachah follows R. Meir! (By saying the law in your own name, you imply that all agree to it!)</p>
<p class="bas indent1"><span class="nm">(f)</span><span class="cl">Rav Huna:</span> How do you hold?</p>
<p class="bas indent1"><span class="nm">(g)</span><span class="cl">Rav Nachman:</span> In such a case, I tell Reuven to verify the signatures first. (If not, we believe Shimon due to the Migo.)</p>
<p class="bas subject"><span class="nm">2)</span>A DOCUMENT OF TRUST</p>
<p class="bas indent1"><span class="nm">(a)</span><span class="cl">(Rav Yehudah):</span> If he says that the document is Amanah (the borrower trusted the prospective lender and gave to him the document before the loan was given), he is not believed.</p>
<p class="bas indent1"><span class="nm">(b)</span><span class="cl">Question:</span> Who claims that it is Amanah?</p>
<p class="bas indent2"><span class="nm">1.</span>Certainly, the borrower is not believed to say this!</p>
<p class="bas indent2"><span class="nm">2.</span>If the lender says this, he should be blessed for his honesty (we need not teach that he is believed)!</p>
<p class="bas indent1"><span class="nm">(c)</span><span class="cl">Answer #1:</span> We must say that the witnesses are saying this.</p>
<p class="bas indent1"><span class="nm">(d)</span><span class="cl">Question:</span> If we can verify their signatures without them, of course they are not believed! If we cannot verify their signatures without them, why shouldn't they be believed?!</p>
<p class="bas indent1"><span class="nm">(e)</span><span class="cl">Answer #2 (Rava):</span> Really, the borrower claims that it is Amanah. He is not believed for the reason of Rav Huna (since he admitted that the document was written properly, he is not believed with a Migo that he could have said that it was forged).</p>
<p class="bas indent1"><span class="nm">(f)</span><span class="cl">Answer #3 (Abaye):</span> Really, the lender says that it is Amanah. It is a case where his admission hurts others (his creditors), like R. Nasan's law:</p>
<p class="bas indent2"><span class="nm">1.</span><span class="cl">(R. Nasan):</span> If Reuven owes to Shimon and Shimon owes to Levi, we take money from Reuven to pay Levi - "He will give to the one to whom the principal is due".</p>
<p class="bas indent1"><span class="nm">(g)</span><span class="cl">Answer #4 (Rav Ashi):</span> Really, the witnesses say that it is Amanah, and we cannot verify their signatures without them.	They are not believed, due to Rav Kahana's law:</p>
<p class="bas indent2"><span class="nm">1.</span><span class="cl">(Rav Kahana):</span> One may not keep a document of Amanah in his house - "Do not let Avlah (fraud) dwell in your home".</p>
<p class="bas bbbline">19b----------------------------------------19b</p>
<p class="bas indent2"><span class="nm">2.</span><span class="cl">(Rav Sheshes brei d'Rav Idi):</span> From Rav Kahana's law we learn that witnesses are not believed to say that the document they signed was Amanah.</p>
<p class="bas indent3"><span class="nm">i.</span>This is because witnesses do not sign on Avlah.</p>
<p class="bas indent1"><span class="nm">(h)</span><span class="cl">(R. Yehoshua ben Levi):</span> One may not keep in his house a document for a loan that was paid - "Do not let Avlah dwell in your home".</p>
<p class="bas indent1"><span class="nm">(i)</span><span class="cl">(Rav):</span> "If there is sin in your hand, distance it" refers to a document of Amanah or Pasim (a document which was written only to make the alleged lender appear rich). "Do not let Avlah dwell in your home" refers to a paid document.</p>
<p class="bas indent2"><span class="nm">1.</span>R. Yehoshua forbids keeping a paid document, all the more so he forbids keeping a document of Amanah;</p>
<p class="bas indent2"><span class="nm">2.</span>Rav Kahana forbids keeping a document of Amanah. He permits keeping a paid document. Sometimes the lender keeps it until the borrower pays the cost of the document.</p>
<p class="bas indent1"><span class="nm">(j)</span><span class="cl">(R. Ami):</span> One may keep an uncorrected Sefer (of Tanach) for 30 days, but no longer - "Do not let Avlah dwell in your home."</p>
<p class="bas indent1"><span class="nm">(k)</span><span class="cl">(Rav Nachman):</span> If witnesses say that the document they signed was Amanah, or that there was a Moda'ah (the seller told the witnesses that he was being coerced and intends to nullify the sale when the coercion ends), they are not believed.</p>
<p class="bas indent1"><span class="nm">(l)</span><span class="cl">(Mar bar Rav Ashi):</span> If witnesses say that the document they signed was Amanah, they are not believed. If they say there was a Moda'ah, they are believed.</p>
<p class="bas indent2"><span class="nm">1.</span>Amanah should not have been written, but a document for which there is a Moda'ah may be written.</p>
<p class="bas subject"><span class="nm">3)</span>WITNESSES WHO SAY THE TRANSACTION WAS ON CONDITION</p>
<p class="bas indent1"><span class="nm">(a)</span><span class="cl">Question (Rava of Rav Nachman):</span> If witnesses say that what they signed was subject to a condition (not written in the document), are they believed?</p>
<p class="bas indent2"><span class="nm">1.</span>You (Rav Nachman) say that they are not believed to say that the document was Amanah or that there was a Moda'ah. If this is because this uproots the document, the same applies to saying that it was conditional!</p>
<p class="bas indent2"><span class="nm">2.</span>Or, perhaps a condition is a separate matter (it is not considered uprooting the document)!</p>
<p class="bas indent1"><span class="nm">(b)</span><span class="cl">Answer (Rav Nachman):</span> When such cases arise, I tell (the buyer) to fulfill the condition (i.e. the witnesses are believed to say that there was a condition).</p>
<p class="bas indent1"><span class="nm">(c)</span><span class="cl">(Rav Papa):</span> If one witness says that it was on condition and the other says that it was not, both agree that the document is valid. We now have one witness saying that there was a condition. One witness is not believed against two (the signatures, which imply that the document is unconditional.)</p>
<p class="bas indent1"><span class="nm">(d)</span><span class="cl">Objection (Rav Huna brei d'Rav Yehoshua):</span> If so, this should apply even when both witnesses say that there was a condition (they should not be believed to change their testimony)!</p>
<p class="bas indent1"><span class="nm">(e)</span><span class="cl">(Rav Huna brei d'Rav Yehoshua):</span> Rather, when both say so, they uproot their testimony. Also when one says that it was conditional, he uproots his testimony (and we are left with only one witness on the document, which is insufficient).</p>
<p class="bas indent1"><span class="nm">(f)</span>The Halachah follows Rav Huna brei d'Rav Yehoshua.</p>
<p class="bas subject"><span class="nm">4)</span>TESTIMONY THAT THE WITNESSES WHO SIGNED WERE INVALID</p>
<p class="bas indent1"><span class="nm">(a)</span><span class="cl">(Beraisa):</span> If David and Levi signed a document and died, and two witnesses recognize the signatures but say that David and Levi were coerced, children or invalid witnesses at the time, they are believed;</p>
<p class="bas indent1"><span class="nm">(b)</span>If two other witnesses recognize the signatures, or if David and Levi signed other documents that were validated by Beis Din after there was a dispute over them, we do not believe the ones who disqualify the document.</p>
<p class="bas indent1"><span class="nm">(c)</span><span class="cl">Inference:</span> It is valid, and the lender may collect with it.</p>
<p class="bas indent1"><span class="nm">(d)</span><span class="cl">Question:</span> Why do we rely on David and Levi more than on the ones who say that they were coerced, children or invalid witnesses at the time?</p>
