<p class="bas subject"><span class="nm">1)</span>THE <i>MIDOS</i> OF MOSHE RABBEINU</p>
<p class="bas indent1"><span class="nm">(a)</span><span class="cl">(Rav Acha bar Ada):</span> Chachamim of Eretz Yisrael consider this verse to be three verses: "Hash-m said to Moshe, I will come to you in a thick cloud..."</p>
<p class="bas indent1"><span class="nm">(b)</span><span class="cl">(R. Chama bar Chanina):</span> Moshe became rich from the excess stone he quarried for the Luchos. "Carve for yourself two tablets of rock like the first ones" - the excess (sapphire) carved out will be yours.</p>
<p class="bas indent1"><span class="nm">(c)</span><span class="cl">(R. Yosi bar Chanina):</span> Torah was only given to Moshe and his descendants. It says "write for yourself" and "carve for yourself." Just like the carvings belong to Moshe, also the writing;</p>
<p class="bas indent2"><span class="nm">1.</span>Moshe was generous and gave the writing to Yisrael - "a generous person will be blessed."</p>
<p class="bas indent1"><span class="nm">(d)</span><span class="cl">Question (Rav Chisda):</span> "Hash-m commanded me at that time to teach you"!</p>
<p class="bas indent1"><span class="nm">(e)</span><span class="cl">Answer:</span> Hash-m commanded me. I (was generous and) taught you.</p>
<p class="bas indent1"><span class="nm">(f)</span><span class="cl">Question:</span> "I taught you statues and laws, like Hash-m commanded me"!</p>
<p class="bas indent1"><span class="nm">(g)</span><span class="cl">Answer:</span> Hash-m commanded me. I taught you.</p>
<p class="bas indent1"><span class="nm">(h)</span><span class="cl">Question:</span> "Write for yourselves this song..."!</p>
<p class="bas indent1"><span class="nm">(i)</span><span class="cl">Answer:</span> Hash-m gave only Shiras Ha'azinu (for Yisrael. Moshe decided to teach the rest of the Torah).</p>
<p class="bas indent1"><span class="nm">(j)</span><span class="cl">Question:</span> "...This song should be a witness for Me in Yisrael..." (Shiras Ha'azinu itself is not a witness)!</p>
<p class="bas indent1"><span class="nm">(k)</span><span class="cl">Correction:</span> R. Yosi bar Chanina meant that Pilpul (a sharp understanding of Torah) was given only to Moshe. (He generously shared this with Yisrael.)</p>
<p class="bas indent1"><span class="nm">(l)</span><span class="cl">(R. Yochanan):</span> Hash-m rests His Presence only on one who is mighty, wealthy, Chacham, and humble. We learn all of these from Moshe:</p>
<p class="bas indent2"><span class="nm">1.</span>Mighty - Moshe spread the curtains over the Mishkan; and the boards were 10 Amos tall.</p>
<p class="bas indent3"><span class="nm">i.</span><span class="cl">Objection:</span> Perhaps he was tall but weak!</p>
<p class="bas indent3"><span class="nm">ii.</span><span class="cl">Retraction:</span> Rather, we learn from his ability to hold the Luchos and throw them.</p>
<p class="bas indent3"><span class="nm">iii.</span><span class="cl">(Beraisa):</span> The Luchos were six (handbreadths) long, six wide, and three thick. (This volume of water weighs about 100 kilos, and rock is much denser than water.)</p>
<p class="bas indent2"><span class="nm">2.</span>Wealthy - Hash-m told Moshe to keep the excess sapphire carved out for the Luchos.</p>
<p class="bas indent2"><span class="nm">3.</span>Chacham - Rav and Shmuel taught that 50 gates of understanding were created. Moshe received 49 of them - "You made him (man) slightly below angels." (Ran - "You made him lack a bit, (perfect knowledge) of Hash-m" - this is the only gate Moshe did not receive.)</p>
<p class="bas indent2"><span class="nm">4.</span>Humble - "Moshe was exceedingly humble."</p>
<p class="bas indent1"><span class="nm">(m)</span><span class="cl">(R. Yochanan):</span> All the Nevi'im were wealthy. We learn this from Moshe, Shmuel, Amos, and Yonah.</p>
<p class="bas indent2"><span class="nm">1.</span>Moshe - "I did not conscript one donkey from them."</p>
<p class="bas indent3"><span class="nm">i.</span><span class="cl">Suggestion:</span> Perhaps this means that he did not take without paying for it.</p>
<p class="bas indent3"><span class="nm">ii.</span><span class="cl">Rejection:</span>  It is not a great praise that he did not do so!</p>
<p class="bas indent3"><span class="nm">iii.</span>Rather, he did not even have to take one and pay for it.</p>
<p class="bas indent3"><span class="nm">iv.</span><span class="cl">Objection:</span> Perhaps he didn't take because he couldn't afford to pay for it!</p>
<p class="bas indent2"><span class="nm">2.</span><span class="cl">Retraction:</span> Rather, Moshe became wealthy from the excess sapphire (like we said above).</p>
<p class="bas indent2"><span class="nm">3.</span>Shmuel - "... Whose ox or donkey did I take?"</p>
<p class="bas indent3"><span class="nm">i.</span>It is no great praise he did not take without paying for it! Rather, he did not even need to take one and pay for it.</p>
<p class="bas indent3"><span class="nm">ii.</span><span class="cl">Objection:</span> Perhaps he didn't take because he couldn't afford to pay for it!</p>
<p class="bas indent2"><span class="nm">4.</span><span class="cl">Retraction:</span> Rather, we learn from "In his return to Ramah, for there is his house";</p>
<p class="bas indent3"><span class="nm">i.</span><span class="cl">(Rava):</span> Wherever he went, his house was with him.</p>
<p class="bas indent3"><span class="nm">ii.</span><span class="cl">(Rava):</span> What it says about Shmuel is greater than what it says about Moshe. Moshe did not forcibly conscript a donkey, even to pay rental. Shmuel did not even rent with their consent - "You did not oppress us nor take willingly."</p>
<p class="bas indent2"><span class="nm">5.</span>Amos - "I am not a (false) Navi (seeking money)... I have cattle and sycamore trees."</p>
<p class="bas indent3"><span class="nm">i.</span>This is based on Rav Yosef's translation.</p>
<p class="bas indent2"><span class="nm">6.</span><span class="cl">Yonah - (R. Yochanan):</span> "He gave its wages and descended" - he paid the hire of the entire ship;</p>
<p class="bas indent3"><span class="nm">i.</span><span class="cl">(Rav Rumnus):</span> This was 4000 gold Dinarim.</p>
<p class="bas indent1"><span class="nm">(n)</span><span class="cl">(R. Yochanan):</span> At first, Moshe learned Torah and forgot it, until it was given to him for a gift - "He gave to Moshe when He finished speaking with him."</p>
<p class="bas subject"><span class="nm">2)</span>WHAT IS CONSIDERED BENEFIT?</p>
<p class="bas indent1"><span class="nm">(a)</span><span class="cl">(Mishnah):</span> If Shimon is Mudar Hana'ah from Reuven, Reuven may feed Shimon's wife and children, even though Shimon must feed them;</p>
<p class="bas indent1"><span class="nm">(b)</span>Reuven may not feed Shimon's animal, whether or not it is Kosher;</p>
<p class="bas indent1"><span class="nm">(c)</span>R. Eliezer says, he may feed Shimon's Tamei animals (Ran - extra food, if they are already being fed), but not his Kosher animals;</p>
<p class="bas indent2"><span class="nm">1.</span><span class="cl">Chachamim:</span> What is the difference?</p>
<p class="bas indent2"><span class="nm">2.</span><span class="cl">R. Eliezer:</span> The soul of a Kosher animal is Hash-m's, but the body is Shimon's (it gets fatter, and he may eat it). A Tamei animal is entirely Hash-m's.</p>
<p class="bas bbbline">38b----------------------------------------38b</p>
<p class="bas indent2"><span class="nm">3.</span><span class="cl">Chachamim:</span> Even if an animal is Tamei, Shimon owns the body. He may sell it to Nochrim, or feed it to his dogs!</p>
<p class="bas indent1"><span class="nm">(d)</span><span class="cl">(Gemara - Rav Yitzchak bar Chananyah):</span> If Shimon is Mudar Hana'ah from Reuven, he may marry off his daughter to him.</p>
<p class="bas indent1"><span class="nm">(e)</span><span class="cl">Question (R. Zeira):</span> Who may marry off his daughter to whom?</p>
<p class="bas indent2"><span class="nm">1.</span>If Reuven marries off his daughter to Shimon, he gives him a slave to serve him! (Surely this is forbidden!)</p>
<p class="bas indent1"><span class="nm">(f)</span><span class="cl">Answer #1:</span> Rather, Shimon may marry off his daughter to Reuven (even though Reuven will feed her).</p>
<p class="bas indent1"><span class="nm">(g)</span><span class="cl">Objection:</span> This is obvious! Our Mishnah teaches even more!</p>
<p class="bas indent2"><span class="nm">1.</span><span class="cl">(Mishnah):</span> Reuven may feed Shimon's wife and children, even though Shimon must feed them.</p>
<p class="bas indent2"><span class="nm">2.</span>All the more so, Reuven may marry Shimon's daughter!</p>
<p class="bas indent1"><span class="nm">(h)</span><span class="cl">Answer #2:</span> Really, Reuven may marry off his daughter to Shimon. The case is, she is a Bogeres, and she herself desires to marry Shimon.</p>
<p class="bas indent2"><span class="nm">1.</span><span class="cl">Support (Beraisa):</span> If Shimon is Mudar Hana'ah from Reuven, Reuven may not marry off his daughter (below Bagrus) to him, but he may marry off his Bogeres to him, if she desires.</p>
<p class="bas indent1"><span class="nm">(i)</span><span class="cl">(R. Yakov):</span> If one is Mudar Hana'ah from his son, in order that the son will learn Torah (and not need to interrupt to honor his father), the son may fill a barrel of water for his father, and light a lamp for him. (Ran - the water and lamp belong to the father. The son merely serves him.)</p>
<p class="bas indent1"><span class="nm">(j)</span><span class="cl">(R. Yitzchak):</span> He may roast a small fish for his father.</p>
<p class="bas indent1"><span class="nm">(k)</span><span class="cl">(R. Yirmiyah):</span> If Reuven was Mudar Hana'ah from Shimon, Shimon may serve him a cup (of Reuven's wine) of Shalom to drink. (</p>
<p class="bas indent1"><span class="nm">(l)</span><span class="cl">Question:</span> What is a cup of Shalom?</p>
<p class="bas indent1"><span class="nm">(m)</span><span class="cl">Answer #1 (Chachamim of Bavel):</span> It is wine given to a mourner.</p>
<p class="bas indent1"><span class="nm">(n)</span><span class="cl">Answer #2 (Chachamim of Eretz Yisrael):</span> It is hot water, which one drinks after bathing in hot water.</p>
<p class="bas indent1"><span class="nm">(o)</span><span class="cl">(Mishnah):</span> He may not feed his animals...</p>
<p class="bas indent1"><span class="nm">(p)</span><span class="cl">(Beraisa - Yehoshua of Uza):</span> Reuven may feed (extra food to) Shimon's Kena'ani slaves, but not his Kosher or Tamei animals.</p>
<p class="bas indent1"><span class="nm">(q)</span><span class="cl">Question:</span> What is the reason?</p>
<p class="bas indent1"><span class="nm">(r)</span><span class="cl">Answer:</span> Slaves are for service (fat slaves do not serve better). It is normal to fatten animals.</p>
