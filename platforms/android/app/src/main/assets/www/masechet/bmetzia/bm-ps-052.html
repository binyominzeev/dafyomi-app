<p class="bas subject"><span class="nm">1)</span>INCOMPLETE COINS (cont.)</p>
<p class="bas indent1"><span class="nm">(a)</span><span class="cl">Question:</span> (If a coin lacks too much), until when may one return it?</p>
<p class="bas indent1"><span class="nm">(b)</span><span class="cl">Answer:</span> In a big city (in which there are moneychangers), one may return it until the time needed to show it to a moneychanger;</p>
<p class="bas indent2"><span class="nm">1.</span>In a village, one may return it until Erev Shabbos (when people buy needs of Shabbos, and would find that it is lacking).</p>
<p class="bas indent1"><span class="nm">(c)</span>If the one who gave the coin recognizes it, he should accept it even after 12 months. He only has complaints (this will be explained).</p>
<p class="bas indent1"><span class="nm">(d)</span>A deficient coin may be used to redeem Ma'aser Sheni, since a proper person accepts it.</p>
<p class="bas indent1"><span class="nm">(e)</span><span class="cl">(Gemara) Contradiction (Beraisa):</span> Until how much can a Sela lack, and one who gives it transgresses Ona'ah?...(If it lacks exactly this amount, it is disqualified. Our Mishnah accepts it!)</p>
<p class="bas indent1"><span class="nm">(f)</span><span class="cl">Answer (Rav Papa):</span> The Mishnah starts from below (a small lack is acceptable, until but not including she Shi'ur each Tana said, e.g. four Isarim). The Beraisa starts from above (a big lack is Ona'ah, until and including the Shi'ur).</p>
<p class="bas indent1"><span class="nm">(g)</span><span class="cl">Question:</span> Why do the Tana'im argue only about Ona'ah of a coin? They do not argue about a purchase (in the Mishnah 49b)!</p>
<p class="bas indent1"><span class="nm">(h)</span><span class="cl">Answer #1 (Rava):</span> They argue also about a purchase. That Mishnah is R. Shimon, who says that one part in six is Ona'ah.</p>
<p class="bas indent1"><span class="nm">(i)</span><span class="cl">Answer #2 (Abaye):</span> Regarding a garment, one pardons up to a sixth. If needed, one overpays for clothing;</p>
<p class="bas indent2"><span class="nm">1.</span>However, if people will not accept a coin, one who received it is not appeased!</p>
<p class="bas indent1"><span class="nm">(j)</span><span class="cl">(Beraisa - R. Meir):</span> A Sela can lack up to four Isarim, one Isar per Dinar, and one does not transgress Ona'ah;</p>
<p class="bas indent1"><span class="nm">(k)</span>R. Yehudah says, it can lack up to four Pundeyonim, one Pundeyon per Dinar.</p>
<p class="bas indent1"><span class="nm">(l)</span>R. Shimon says, it can lack up to eight Pundeyonim, two Pundeyonim per Dinar.</p>
<p class="bas indent1"><span class="nm">(m)</span>If it lacks more than this, it is sold for its value.</p>
<p class="bas indent1"><span class="nm">(n)</span><span class="cl">Question:</span> How much can a deficient coin lack, and one may keep it (we are not concerned lest it be used to deceive)?</p>
<p class="bas indent1"><span class="nm">(o)</span><span class="cl">Answer:</span> A Sela may lack up to a Shekel (half a Sela. If it lacks more than the permitted Shi'ur one may amount for a Sela, this is recognizable, but when it is less than a Shekel, others might think that it is a proper Shekel and accept it in place of a Shekel.) A Dinar may lack until Rova (a quarter).</p>
<p class="bas indent2"><span class="nm">1.</span>An Isar less than this, it is forbidden.</p>
<p class="bas indent2"><span class="nm">2.</span>He may not sell it to a merchant, extortionist or murderer, for they will deceive others with it.</p>
<p class="bas indent2"><span class="nm">3.</span>Rather, he should make a hole in it and let his child wear it like a necklace.</p>
<p class="bas indent1"><span class="nm">(p)</span><span class="cl">Question:</span> Why may one keep a Sela until it lacks half, but one may keep a Dinar until it lacks a quarter?</p>
<p class="bas indent1"><span class="nm">(q)</span><span class="cl">Answer (Abaye):</span> The Beraisa means that a Dinar can lack until a quarter of a Shekel, which is half a Dinar.</p>
<p class="bas indent1"><span class="nm">(r)</span><span class="cl">Support (Rava):</span> The Beraisa says 'Rova' (which can denote a quarter Dinar <i>or</i> a quarter Shekel).' It does not say 'Revi'i (a quarter, which would clearly mean a quarter Dinar).</p>
<p class="bas indent1"><span class="nm">(s)</span><span class="cl">Question:</span> Why does the Tana express the amount with respect to a Shekel? He should say 'until half (of its own value)'!</p>
<p class="bas indent1"><span class="nm">(t)</span><span class="cl">Answer:</span> This teaches (concisely) that one may keep a deficient Shekel that now weighs a Dinar. This supports R. Ami.</p>
<p class="bas indent2"><span class="nm">1.</span><span class="cl">(R. Ami):</span> One may keep a deficient Shekel that now weighs a Dinar. One may not keep a deficient Sela that now weighs a Dinar (since it comes from a thick, wide coin, people might think that it is a Shekel).</p>
<p class="bas subject"><span class="nm">2)</span>KEEPING DEFICIENT COINS</p>
<p class="bas indent1"><span class="nm">(a)</span><span class="cl">(Beraisa):</span> An Isar less than this, it is forbidden.</p>
<p class="bas indent1"><span class="nm">(b)</span><span class="cl">Question:</span> What does this mean?</p>
<p class="bas indent1"><span class="nm">(c)</span><span class="cl">Answer #1 (Abaye):</span> If it lacks an Isar more than the allowed deficiency, one may not use it.</p>
<p class="bas indent1"><span class="nm">(d)</span><span class="cl">Rejection (Rava):</span> If it lacks anything more than the allowed deficiency, one may not use it!</p>
<p class="bas indent1"><span class="nm">(e)</span><span class="cl">Answer #2 (Rava):</span> If a Sela lacks an Isar per Dinar, one may not use it. The Beraisa is R. Meir (in the previous Beraisa).</p>
<p class="bas indent1"><span class="nm">(f)</span><span class="cl">(Mishnah):</span> If a Sela was disqualified and fixed to be used for weighing, it receives Tum'ah (for it has been transformed into a Kli);</p>
<p class="bas indent2"><span class="nm">1.</span>Until how much can a coin lack, and one may keep it? A Sela may be until two Dinarim (half a Sela). If it is less than this, he must cut it (in half).</p>
<p class="bas indent1"><span class="nm">(g)</span><span class="cl">Question:</span> If more than two Dinarim remain, what is the law?</p>
<p class="bas indent1"><span class="nm">(h)</span><span class="cl">Answer #1 (Rav Huna):</span> Whether more or less than two Dinarim remain, he must cut it.</p>
<p class="bas indent1"><span class="nm">(i)</span><span class="cl">Answer #2 (R. Ami):</span> If less than two Dinarim remain, he must cut it. If more than two Dinarim remain, he may keep it.</p>
<p class="bas bbbline">52b----------------------------------------52b</p>
<p class="bas indent1"><span class="nm">(j)</span><span class="cl">Question (against Rav Huna - Beraisa):</span> If more remains, he sells it for its value.</p>
<p class="bas indent2"><span class="nm">1.</span><span class="cl">Suggestion:</span> The case is, it lacks more than the amount of Ona'ah (he sells it according to its weight).</p>
<p class="bas indent1"><span class="nm">(k)</span><span class="cl">Answer:</span> No, it lacks less than the amount of Ona'ah (he sells it for its minted value, a Sela).</p>
<p class="bas indent1"><span class="nm">(l)</span><span class="cl">Question (Beraisa):</span> Until how much can a coin lack, and one may keep it? One may keep a Sela until a Shekel.</p>
<p class="bas indent2"><span class="nm">1.</span><span class="cl">Suggestion:</span> It decreases gradually, and one may keep it until it is less than a Shekel.</p>
<p class="bas indent1"><span class="nm">(m)</span><span class="cl">Answer:</span> No, it fell into a fire. The decrease came all at once.</p>
<p class="bas indent1"><span class="nm">(n)</span><span class="cl">(Beraisa):</span> He makes a hole in it and his child wears it like a necklace.</p>
<p class="bas indent1"><span class="nm">(o)</span><span class="cl">Contradiction (Beraisa):</span> One may not use a deficient coin like a weight, nor throw it among his broken silver Kelim, nor make a hole in it to be a necklace for his child. Rather, he pulverizes it, melts it, cuts it or throws it in the Dead Sea.</p>
<p class="bas indent1"><span class="nm">(p)</span><span class="cl">Answer:</span> One may make a hole in the middle, but not in the side (lest a swindler even it out to make it look proper).</p>
<p class="bas subject"><span class="nm">3)</span>RETURNING DEFICIENT COINS</p>
<p class="bas indent1"><span class="nm">(a)</span><span class="cl">(Mishnah):</span> In a big city, he may return it until the time needed to show it to a moneychanger. In a village, he has until Erev Shabbos.</p>
<p class="bas indent1"><span class="nm">(b)</span><span class="cl">Question:</span> Why does the time to return coins vary between cities and villages, but not for returning a purchase (the Mishnah 49b)?</p>
<p class="bas indent1"><span class="nm">(c)</span><span class="cl">Answer #1 (Abaye):</span> The Mishnah about a purchase teaches the law for cities (indeed, the law in villages is different)!</p>
<p class="bas indent1"><span class="nm">(d)</span><span class="cl">Answer #2 (Rava):</span> Everyone knows the value of a garment, but only moneychangers are proficient about coins;</p>
<p class="bas indent2"><span class="nm">1.</span>In a city, one can show it to a moneychanger. In a village, he will find that it is lacking when he tries spending it Erev Shabbos, when people buy needs of Shabbos.</p>
<p class="bas indent1"><span class="nm">(e)</span><span class="cl">(Mishnah):</span> If the one who gave the coin recognizes it, he should accept it even after 12 months...</p>
<p class="bas indent1"><span class="nm">(f)</span><span class="cl">Question:</span> Where does this apply?</p>
<p class="bas indent2"><span class="nm">1.</span>In big cities, one has only the time to show a moneychanger!</p>
<p class="bas indent2"><span class="nm">2.</span>In a village, one has only until Erev Shabbos!</p>
<p class="bas indent1"><span class="nm">(g)</span><span class="cl">Answer (Rav Chisda):</span> The Mishnah discusses one who wants to go beyond the letter of the law.</p>
<p class="bas indent1"><span class="nm">(h)</span><span class="cl">Question:</span> The Mishnah continues 'he only has complaints.' Rather than have complaints, he should (stick to letter of the law, and) not accept it!</p>
<p class="bas indent1"><span class="nm">(i)</span><span class="cl">Answer:</span> It means that if the one who gave it does not accept it back, the receiver has only complaints. (He caused his own loss by delaying.)</p>
<p class="bas indent1"><span class="nm">(j)</span><span class="cl">(Mishnah):</span> He may use it to redeem Ma'aser Sheni, for only a bad person refuses it.</p>
<p class="bas indent1"><span class="nm">(k)</span><span class="cl">Inference (Rav Papa):</span> One who does not accept deficient coins is a bad person.</p>
<p class="bas indent2"><span class="nm">1.</span>This is only if the coins are accepted (by most people).</p>
<p class="bas indent1"><span class="nm">(l)</span>This supports Chizkiyah.</p>
<p class="bas indent2"><span class="nm">1.</span><span class="cl">(Chizkiyah):</span> If one exchanges a deficient coin (above the amount of Ona'ah) for Perutos, he exchanges according to its value (weight). He redeems onto it as if it were a good coin.</p>
<p class="bas indent2"><span class="nm">2.</span><span class="cl">Question:</span> What does this mean? (The first law is obvious, from the Mishnah!)</p>
<p class="bas indent2"><span class="nm">3.</span><span class="cl">Answer #1:</span> Even though if one exchanges a deficient coin for Perutos, he exchanges according to its value, one redeems onto it as if it were a good coin.</p>
<p class="bas indent2"><span class="nm">4.</span><span class="cl">Objection:</span> Here, Chizkiyah is lenient about Ma'aser Sheni;</p>
<p class="bas indent3"><span class="nm">i.</span><span class="cl">Contradiction (Chizkiyah):</span> If Ma'aser Sheni is worth less than a Perutah, he redeems it and its Chomesh onto prior coins (coins already used to redeem Ma'aser), for surely he was not exact (the prior coins were worth more than the Ma'aser he redeemed on them, and can redeem also this Ma'aser. Since Chizkiyah requires using coins worth more than the Ma'aser, surely he does not allow redeeming on deficient coins as if they were good!)</p>
<p class="bas indent2"><span class="nm">5.</span><span class="cl">Answer #2:</span> Rather, Chizkiyah says 'he redeems onto it like a good coin', i.e. no more than it is definitely worth;</p>
<p class="bas indent3"><span class="nm">i.</span>We allow only one leniency (we do not consider it an Asimon that is invalid for redemption).</p>
<p class="bas subject"><span class="nm">4)</span>REDEEMING MA'ASER WORTH LESS THAN A PRUTAH</p>
<p class="bas indent1"><span class="nm">(a)</span><span class="cl">(Chizkiyah):</span> (One who redeems his Ma'aser Sheni must add a Chomesh, i.e. a quarter of the principal.) If Ma'aser Sheni is worth less than a Perutah, one may redeem it and its Chomesh on prior coins (i.e. Ma'aser was previously redeemed on them), for surely he was not exact (the coins were worth more than the Ma'aser he redeemed on them and its Chomesh).</p>
