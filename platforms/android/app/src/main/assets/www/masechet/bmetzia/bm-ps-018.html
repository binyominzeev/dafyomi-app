<p class="bas subject"><span class="nm">1)</span>A <i>KESUVAH</i> FROM <i>KIDUSHIN</i> (cont.)</p>
<p class="bas indent1"><span class="nm">(a)</span><span class="cl">Answer #1:</span> Abaye learned from the following.</p>
<p class="bas indent2"><span class="nm">1.</span><span class="cl">(Rav Chiya bar Ami - Beraisa):</span> If an Arusah (a wife during Eirusin, i.e. engagement) dies, her husband does not become an Onen (a mourner before the burial) and does not become Tamei to engage in her burial. If  he dies, she does not become an Onen or become Tamei for him. If she dies, he does not inherit her. If he dies, she collects her Kesuvah.</p>
<p class="bas indent2"><span class="nm">2.</span><span class="cl">Rejection:</span> Perhaps that is when he wrote her a Kesuvah!</p>
<p class="bas indent2"><span class="nm">3.</span><span class="cl">Question:</span> If so, this is obvious!</p>
<p class="bas indent2"><span class="nm">4.</span><span class="cl">Answer:</span> (Indeed, it is.) It was taught along with 'when she dies, he does not inherit her', which was not obvious.</p>
<p class="bas indent1"><span class="nm">(b)</span><span class="cl">Answer #2:</span> Abaye had no source that a widow from Kidushin gets a Kesuvah. He retracted due to the Mishnah itself.</p>
<p class="bas indent2"><span class="nm">1.</span>If the Mishnah is in a place where people do not write Kesuvos, the Get is the Kesuvah, and it does not say that she collects 100 or 200!</p>
<p class="bas indent2"><span class="nm">2.</span><span class="cl">Suggestion:</span> Perhaps since Chachamim enacted 100 or 200, it is as if this is written in the Get!</p>
<p class="bas indent2"><span class="nm">3.</span><span class="cl">Rejection:</span> If so, he could claim that he paid her!</p>
<p class="bas indent2"><span class="nm">4.</span><span class="cl">Suggestion:</span> Perhaps that is no claim, for then he should have torn the Get (to stop her from collecting again).</p>
<p class="bas indent2"><span class="nm">5.</span><span class="cl">Rejection:</span> He cannot tear it, for she needs it to remarry!</p>
<p class="bas indent2"><span class="nm">6.</span><span class="cl">Suggestion:</span> Beis Din should have torn the Get, and written that the tear just shows that the Kesuvah was paid, but not that the Get is invalid!</p>
<p class="bas indent2"><span class="nm">7.</span><span class="cl">Rejection:</span> He can say that he paid her outside of Beis Din (therefore, it is not torn)!</p>
<p class="bas subject"><span class="nm">2)</span>CONCERN LEST A DIFFERENT DOCUMENT WAS FOUND</p>
<p class="bas indent1"><span class="nm">(a)</span><span class="cl">(Mishnah):</span> If one finds a Get of divorce or freedom, or a document of a gift or a receipt, he does not return it. Perhaps the giver reconsidered and never gave it.</p>
<p class="bas indent1"><span class="nm">(b)</span><span class="cl">(Gemara) Inference:</span> The only concern is that he reconsidered. If he would say to give it, we would give it, even if it was found much later!</p>
<p class="bas indent1"><span class="nm">(c)</span><span class="cl">Contradiction (Mishnah):</span> If one brought a Get and lost it, if he found it immediately, it is Kosher. If not, it is invalid.</p>
<p class="bas indent1"><span class="nm">(d)</span><span class="cl">Answer #1 (Rabah):</span> If it was lost in a place through which caravans pass, it is only valid if it was found immediately. If caravans do not pass through, it is Kosher even if it was found later.</p>
<p class="bas indent2"><span class="nm">1.</span>Even where caravans pass, it is invalid (if found later) only if we know that another couple in the city have the same names as on this Get. If we do not know, it is Kosher.</p>
<p class="bas indent2"><span class="nm">2.</span>If we would not say this, Rabah would contradict himself.</p>
<p class="bas indent3"><span class="nm">i.</span>A Get was found in Rav Huna's Beis Din. It said 'in the city of Sheviri, on the Rachis River.'</p>
<p class="bas indent3"><span class="nm">ii.</span><span class="cl">Question (Rav Huna):</span> Are we concerned lest there are two cities 'Sheviri' on the Rachis River (and this Get belongs to a man of the other city, so we do not return it)?</p>
<p class="bas bbbline">18b----------------------------------------18b</p>
<p class="bas indent3"><span class="nm">iii.</span><span class="cl">Answer (Rabah - Mishnah):</span> We return any document of actions of Beis Din.</p>
<p class="bas indent2"><span class="nm">3.</span>Even though Rav Huna's Beis Din is (frequented by many people) like a place where caravans pass, Rabah ruled that we return it!</p>
<p class="bas indent3"><span class="nm">i.</span>We must say that if we do not know that two couples have the same names (or that there is another city with the same name), we are not concerned.</p>
<p class="bas indent1"><span class="nm">(e)</span>Rabah ruled like this about a document found in the flax district of Pumbedisa.</p>
<p class="bas indent2"><span class="nm">1.</span><span class="cl">Version #1:</span> It was where flax is sold. Caravans pass there. He returned it because we did not know about someone else with the same name.</p>
<p class="bas indent2"><span class="nm">2.</span><span class="cl">Version #2:</span> It was where flax is soaked. He returned it even though there was someone else with the same name, because caravans do not pass there. (end of Version #2)</p>
<p class="bas indent1"><span class="nm">(f)</span><span class="cl">Question (R. Zeira - Mishnah):</span> One who brings a Get and lost it, if he found it immediately, it is Kosher. If not, it is invalid.</p>
<p class="bas indent2"><span class="nm">1.</span><span class="cl">Contradiction (Beraisa):</span> If a Get was found in the market, if the husband says to give it, we give it to his wife. If not, we do not return it to either of them.</p>
<p class="bas indent2"><span class="nm">2.</span><span class="cl">Inference:</span> When the husband agrees, we give it to her, even if it was found long after it was dropped!</p>
<p class="bas indent1"><span class="nm">(g)</span><span class="cl">Answer #1 (R. Zeira):</span> If it was lost in a place through which caravans pass, it is valid only if it was found immediately. If caravans do not pass through, it is Kosher even if it was found later.</p>
<p class="bas indent2"><span class="nm">1.</span><span class="cl">Version #1:</span> Even where caravans pass, we are concerned only if we know of someone else with the same name. This is like Rabah.</p>
<p class="bas indent2"><span class="nm">2.</span><span class="cl">Version #2:</span> Where caravans pass, we are concerned even if we do not know of someone else with the same name. R. Zeira argues with Rabah. (end of Version #2)</p>
<p class="bas indent1"><span class="nm">(h)</span>Rabah did not ask like R. Zeira, for it is better to ask a contradiction between Mishnayos.</p>
<p class="bas indent1"><span class="nm">(i)</span><span class="cl">Question:</span> Why did R. Zeira prefer to ask the contradiction between the Mishnah and Beraisa?</p>
<p class="bas indent1"><span class="nm">(j)</span><span class="cl">Answer:</span> Our Mishnah does not explicitly discuss returning it to her. We only <i>inferred</i> that we return it to her when he agrees. Perhaps this is only if it was found immediately. (However, the Beraisa explicitly discusses returning it to her. If this were only immediately, it would have said so.)</p>
<p class="bas indent1"><span class="nm">(k)</span><span class="cl">Question:</span> According to Version #2, where caravans pass, R. Zeira is concerned even if we do not know of someone else with the same name. What do he and Rabah argue about?</p>
<p class="bas indent1"><span class="nm">(l)</span><span class="cl">Answer:</span> Rabah explains that in the Mishnah 'all actions of Beis Din, we return them' implies that it was found in Beis Din, which is like a place where caravans pass;</p>
<p class="bas indent2"><span class="nm">1.</span>We must say that only when we know of someone else with the same name, we do not return;</p>
<p class="bas indent1"><span class="nm">(m)</span>R. Zeira disagrees. The Mishnah does not say that they were found <i>in</i> Beis Din. They were found outside (which is not like a place where caravans pass).</p>
<p class="bas subject"><span class="nm">3)</span>OTHER ANSWERS</p>
<p class="bas indent1"><span class="nm">(a)</span><span class="cl">Answer #2 (to contradictions 2:c and 2:f - R. Yirmiyah):</span> The Mishnah permits returning a Get when the witnesses say that they only signed on one Get for a man of this name.</p>
<p class="bas indent2"><span class="nm">1.</span><span class="cl">Question:</span> Obviously, we may return such a Get!</p>
<p class="bas indent2"><span class="nm">2.</span><span class="cl">Answer:</span> One might have thought that we should be concerned lest other witnesses with the same names as these witnesses signed a Get for another couple with the same names. He teaches that we are not concerned.</p>
<p class="bas indent1"><span class="nm">(b)</span><span class="cl">Answer #3 (Rav Ashi):</span> The Mishnah permits returning a Get when the loser tells us (a superb Siman (sign that it is his), such as) a hole in the Get next to a particular letter.</p>
<p class="bas indent2"><span class="nm">1.</span>This is only if he says which letter the hole is near. If he says only that there is a hole, we do not return it.</p>
<p class="bas indent2"><span class="nm">2.</span>Rav Ashi is unsure whether the Torah allows returning lost objects when the loser gives a mediocre Siman. (If so, this suffices also for a Get.) Or, perhaps this is only a Rabbinical enactment (regarding money, but for a Get we require a superb Siman. Due to his doubt, he requires a superb Siman.)</p>
