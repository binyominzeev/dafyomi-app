<p class="bas subject"><span class="nm">1)</span>THINGS THAT MUST BE ANNOUNCED</p>
<p class="bas indent1"><span class="nm">(a)</span><span class="cl">(Mishnah):</span> The following must be announced: Peros found in a Kli, an empty Kli, coins in a wallet or an empty wallet, bunches of Peros or coins, three coins on top of each other, bundles of sheaves in a Reshus ha'Yachid, loaves (not of a baker), shearings from the dyer's store, and barrels of wine or oil.</p>
<p class="bas indent1"><span class="nm">(b)</span><span class="cl">(Gemara) Inference:</span> One must announce Peros found <i>in</i> a Kli and coins <i>in</i> a wallet. If they were found in front of the Kli or wallet, he keeps (the Peros or coins, even if the Kli or wallet has a Siman)!</p>
<p class="bas indent1"><span class="nm">(c)</span>Our Mishnah teaches like the following Beraisa.</p>
<p class="bas indent2"><span class="nm">1.</span><span class="cl">(Beraisa #1):</span> If one finds Peros in front of a Kli or coins in front of a wallet, he keeps them;</p>
<p class="bas indent2"><span class="nm">2.</span>If some of the Peros or coins are in the Kli or wallet and some are on the ground, he must announce.</p>
<p class="bas indent1"><span class="nm">(d)</span><span class="cl">Contradiction (Beraisa #2):</span> If one finds something with a Siman next to something without a Siman, he must announce (both).</p>
<p class="bas indent2"><span class="nm">1.</span>If someone gave the Siman (and said that the other object is not his), the finder keeps the other object.</p>
<p class="bas indent1"><span class="nm">(e)</span><span class="cl">Answer #1 (Rav Zvid):</span> The Mishnah (and Beraisa #1) permits keeping flax found near a barrel, or coins near a wallet. They could not have come from the barrel or wallet, for surely some would have remained inside;</p>
<p class="bas indent2"><span class="nm">1.</span>Beraisa #2 discusses Peros that could entirely spill out of the Kli.</p>
<p class="bas indent1"><span class="nm">(f)</span><span class="cl">Answer #2 (Rav Papa):</span> Both discuss Peros found in front of a Kli. We assume that the Kli has a rim (like most do) that would keep some of the contents inside.</p>
<p class="bas indent2"><span class="nm">1.</span>In the Mishnah, nothing remains in the Kli. In Beraisa #2, some remains inside.</p>
<p class="bas indent1"><span class="nm">(g)</span><span class="cl">Answer #3:</span> In both cases, nothing remains inside. In Beraisa #2, the mouth of the Kli faces the Peros (so presumably, the Peros came from the Kli). In the Mishnah, the mouth faces away.</p>
<p class="bas indent1"><span class="nm">(h)</span><span class="cl">Answer #4:</span> In both cases, nothing remains inside, and the mouth of the Kli faces the Peros. In the Mishnah, the Kli has a rim. In Beraisa #2, it does not.</p>
<p class="bas indent1"><span class="nm">(i)</span><span class="cl">(Mishnah):</span> Bunches of Peros or coins (must be announced).</p>
<p class="bas indent1"><span class="nm">(j)</span><span class="cl">Inference:</span> This teaches that number is a Siman (for they have no other Siman)!</p>
<p class="bas indent1"><span class="nm">(k)</span><span class="cl">Rejection:</span> No, the Mishnah refers to one bunch of Peros. The Siman is the place it was found.</p>
<p class="bas indent1"><span class="nm">(l)</span><span class="cl">Inference:</span> This teaches that place is a Siman!</p>
<p class="bas indent1"><span class="nm">(m)</span><span class="cl">Rejection:</span> Perhaps the Mishnah refers to bunches of Peros, and the Siman is the number.</p>
<p class="bas indent1"><span class="nm"></p>
<p class="bas subject"><span class="nm">2)</span></span>FOUND COINS</p>
<p class="bas indent1"><span class="nm">(a)</span><span class="cl">(Mishnah):</span> Three coins on top of each other (must be announced).</p>
<p class="bas indent1"><span class="nm">(b)</span><span class="cl">(R. Yitzchak Migdala'ah):</span> This is only if they are stacked like a tower. If not, he keeps them.</p>
<p class="bas indent1"><span class="nm">(c)</span><span class="cl">Support (Beraisa):</span> If one found scattered coins, he keeps them. If they are stacked like towers he must announce them;</p>
<p class="bas indent2"><span class="nm">1.</span>A tower is three coins on top of each other.</p>
<p class="bas indent1"><span class="nm">(d)</span><span class="cl">Question:</span> First, the Beraisa permits scattered coins. This implies that if they overlap at all, he must announce them. Then it says that if they are stacked like towers, he must announce them. This implies that if they merely overlap, he keeps them!</p>
<p class="bas indent1"><span class="nm">(e)</span><span class="cl">Answer:</span> If they are not like a tower, the Tana calls this scattered.</p>
<p class="bas indent1"><span class="nm">(f)</span><span class="cl">(R. Chanina):</span> This is only if there are of three different kings. If they are of the same king, he need not announce them.</p>
<p class="bas indent1"><span class="nm">(g)</span><span class="cl">Question:</span> What is the case?</p>
<p class="bas indent2"><span class="nm">1.</span>If they are like a tower, even if they are of the same king, he must announce them!</p>
<p class="bas indent2"><span class="nm">2.</span>If they are not like a tower, even if they are of different kings, he need not announce them!</p>
<p class="bas indent1"><span class="nm">(h)</span><span class="cl">Correction:</span> Rather, he must announce them only if they are of one king, but are like of three different kings (they are different sizes).</p>
<p class="bas indent1"><span class="nm">(i)</span><span class="cl">Question:</span> What is the case?</p>
<p class="bas indent1"><span class="nm">(j)</span><span class="cl">Answer:</span> They are like a pyramid. The widest is on bottom, the next widest is over it, and the narrowest is on top. Surely he placed them this way;</p>
<p class="bas indent2"><span class="nm">1.</span>If they are like coins of one king, i.e. they are all the same width, he does not announce them. We suppose that he did not place them; they happened to fall that way.</p>
<p class="bas indent1"><span class="nm">(k)</span><span class="cl">(R. Yochanan):</span> Even if they are (like) of the same king, he must announce them.</p>
<p class="bas indent1"><span class="nm">(l)</span><span class="cl">Question:</span> What does he announce?</p>
<p class="bas indent1"><span class="nm">(m)</span><span class="cl">Answer #1:</span> He announces the number that he found.</p>
<p class="bas indent1"><span class="nm">(n)</span><span class="cl">Rejection:</span> If so (the finder need not say how many he lost), even if he found two, he should announce them!</p>
<p class="bas indent1"><span class="nm">(o)</span><span class="cl">Answer #2 (Ravina):</span> Rather, he announces that he found coins.</p>
<p class="bas indent1"><span class="nm">(p)</span><span class="cl">Questions (R. Yirmiyah):</span> What is the law in the following cases: he found them in a circle; in a row; in a triangle; like steps?</p>
<p class="bas indent1"><span class="nm">(q)</span><span class="cl">Answer (regarding steps):</span> Rav Nachman taught that if one can move them all at once using a chip of wood, he must announce them.</p>
<p class="bas bbbline">25b----------------------------------------25b</p>
<p class="bas indent1"><span class="nm">(r)</span><span class="cl">Question (Rav Ashi):</span> If they are arranged like the idol Markulis (this will be explained), what is the law?</p>
<p class="bas indent1"><span class="nm">(s)</span><span class="cl">Answer (Beraisa):</span> If one found scattered coins, he keeps them. If they are arranged like Markulis, he must announce them;</p>
<p class="bas indent2"><span class="nm">1.</span>Markulis is two stones near each other, and a third resting partially on each of the two.</p>
<p class="bas indent1"><span class="nm">(t)</span><span class="cl">(Beraisa):</span> If Reuven found a Sela in the market, and Shimon said 'it is mine. It was new', 'Niron Kaiser's name was on it', or 'it was of King Ploni', he does not get it;</p>
<p class="bas indent2"><span class="nm">1.</span>Even if Shimon's name was on it, he does not get it, for Simanim do not help for coins.</p>
<p class="bas indent2"><span class="nm">2.</span>Perhaps he spent it, and someone else dropped it!</p>
<p class="bas subject"><span class="nm">3)</span>ONE WHO FINDS CHICKS</p>
<p class="bas indent1"><span class="nm">(a)</span><span class="cl">(Mishnah):</span> If one finds tied chicks in back of a fence, or on a path in a field, he leaves them there.</p>
<p class="bas indent1"><span class="nm">(b)</span>If one finds a Kli in the waste heap, if it is covered, he leaves it. If it is exposed, he takes and announces it.</p>
<p class="bas indent1"><span class="nm">(c)</span><span class="cl">(Gemara) Question:</span> Why does he leave it?</p>
<p class="bas indent1"><span class="nm">(d)</span><span class="cl">Answer:</span> We assume that someone left it there. If the finder would take it, the owner will not find it, and perhaps he does not have a Siman!</p>
<p class="bas indent1"><span class="nm">(e)</span><span class="cl">Question:</span> The knot should be a Siman!</p>
<p class="bas indent1"><span class="nm">(f)</span><span class="cl">Answer (R. Aba bar Zavda):</span> They are tied by their wings. Everyone ties them this way.</p>
<p class="bas indent1"><span class="nm">(g)</span><span class="cl">Question:</span> The place they were found should be a Siman!</p>
<p class="bas indent1"><span class="nm">(h)</span><span class="cl">Answer (Rav Ukva bar Chama):</span> They can walk slowly.</p>
<p class="bas indent1"><span class="nm">(i)</span><span class="cl">Question:</span> If so, perhaps they came from afar. The finder should keep them!</p>
<p class="bas indent1"><span class="nm">(j)</span><span class="cl">Answer:</span> Perhaps they came from afar, and perhaps they were placed there;</p>
<p class="bas indent2"><span class="nm">1.</span>Whenever there is a Safek if something was placed, one may not take it. If he took it, he does not put it back.</p>
<p class="bas subject"><span class="nm">4)</span>THINGS FOUND IN A WASTEHEAP</p>
<p class="bas indent1"><span class="nm">(a)</span><span class="cl">(Mishnah):</span> If one finds a Kli in the waste heap, if it is covered, he leaves it. If it is exposed, he takes and announces it.</p>
<p class="bas indent1"><span class="nm">(b)</span><span class="cl">Contradiction (Beraisa):</span> If one finds a Kli covered in the waste heap, he takes and announces it, for waste heaps are often cleared out. (If he leaves it, the item will perish!)</p>
<p class="bas indent1"><span class="nm">(c)</span><span class="cl">Answer #1 (Rav Zvid):</span> If one finds a wine flask or cup, it was put there intentionally, so he should leave it. A knife or small fork was presumably lost or thrown out, so he takes it.</p>
<p class="bas indent1"><span class="nm">(d)</span><span class="cl">Answer #2 (Rav Papa):</span> Both refer to a wine flask or cup. If the waste heap is often cleared out, he takes it. If the waste heap is not often cleared out, he leaves it.</p>
<p class="bas indent1"><span class="nm">(e)</span><span class="cl">Question:</span> If it is often cleared out, the owner knowingly threw it out to be lost!</p>
<p class="bas indent1"><span class="nm">(f)</span><span class="cl">Answer #3 (Rav Papa):</span> Rather, he takes it if the waste heap is not normally cleared out, and they reconsidered to clear it out.</p>
<p class="bas indent2"><span class="nm">1.</span>This explains the expression of the Beraisa 'for waste heaps are often cleared out.'</p>
<p class="bas indent1"><span class="nm">(g)</span><span class="cl">Question:</span> According to Rav Zvid, what does this mean?</p>
<p class="bas indent1"><span class="nm">(h)</span><span class="cl">Answer:</span> It is common to (accidentally) clear out small Kelim <i>to</i> waste heaps.</p>
<p class="bas subject"><span class="nm">5)</span>THINGS FOUND IN A WALL</p>
<p class="bas indent1"><span class="nm">(a)</span><span class="cl">(Mishnah):</span> One may keep things found in a rock pile or an old wall.</p>
<p class="bas indent1"><span class="nm">(b)</span>If something was found in (a hole in) a new wall (between Reuven's property and Reshus ha'Rabim (a public road):</p>
<p class="bas indent2"><span class="nm">1.</span>If it was in the half facing Reshus ha'Rabim, the finder keeps it;</p>
<p class="bas indent2"><span class="nm">2.</span>If it was in the half facing Reuven's premises, Reuven gets it.</p>
<p class="bas indent1"><span class="nm">(c)</span>If Reuven rented his house to others, one may keep what he finds even in the house.</p>
<p class="bas indent1"><span class="nm">(d)</span><span class="cl">(Gemara - Beraisa):</span> (In an old wall) the finder keeps it, because he can say that it was from Kena'anim (from before Bnei Yisrael entered Eretz Yisrael with Yehoshua).</p>
<p class="bas indent1"><span class="nm">(e)</span><span class="cl">Question:</span> Why may he say so? Perhaps a Yisrael owned the wall and left it inside!</p>
<p class="bas indent1"><span class="nm">(f)</span><span class="cl">Answer:</span> They are very rusted. (No one leaves things so long.)</p>
