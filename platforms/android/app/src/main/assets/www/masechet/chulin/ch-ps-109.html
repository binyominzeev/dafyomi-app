<div class="indent1"><span class="nm">(a)</span><p><span class="cl">Deduction:</span> If 'not stirred or covered' means that it was only stirred or covered later, 'it was stirred or covered' means from the beginning, and R. Yehudah forbids this.</p></div>
<div class="indent1"><span class="nm">(b)</span><p><span class="cl">Question:</span> What is the reason? Everything in the pot absorbes the milk equally. The piece it fell on never absorbed enough to receive Ta'am!</p></div>
<div class="indent1"><span class="nm">(c)</span><p><span class="cl">Answer:</span> R. Yehudah decrees, lest the pot was not stirred so well.</p></div>
<div class="indent1"><span class="nm">(d)</span><p><span class="cl">(Beraisa - Rebbi):</span> (I agree with) Chachamim when the pot was stirred or covered.</p></div>
<div class="indent1"><span class="nm">(e)</span><p><span class="cl">Question:</span> What does he mean 'when the pot was stirred or covered'?</p></div>
<div class="indent2"><span class="nm">1.</span><p><span class="cl">Suggestion:</span> It was stirred or covered later, but not at first.</p></div>
<div class="indent2"><span class="nm">2.</span><p><span class="cl">Rejection:</span> We showed (108b 5:d) that this is the case in which Rebbi agrees with R. Yehudah!</p></div>
<div class="indent1"><span class="nm">(f)</span><p><span class="cl">Answer:</span> Rather, it was stirred or covered from the beginning.</p></div>
<div class="indent1"><span class="nm">(g)</span><p><span class="cl">Deduction:</span> Chachamim permit even if it was stirred or covered only later (and Rebbi forbids, like R. Yehudah). Chachamim permit Efshar Lesochto.</p></div>
<div class="indent1"><span class="nm">(h)</span><p><span class="cl">Question (Rav Acha mi'Difti):</span> Why must we say that they argue about Efshar Lesochto?</p></div>
<div class="indent2"><span class="nm">1.</span><p>Perhaps all forbid, and they argue about Min b'Mino!</p></div>
<div class="indent2"><span class="nm">2.</span><p>R. Yehudah holds (like he holds elsewhere) that it is never Batel. Chachamim hold that it is Batel.</p></div>
<div class="indent1"><span class="nm">(i)</span><p><span class="cl">Answer (Ravina):</span> If we say that all forbid Min b'Mino, and they argue about Efshar Lesochto (whether it was stirred or covered from the beginning, or only later), we understand why Rebbi agrees with R. Yehudah in one case, and with Chachamim in the other;</p></div>
<div class="indent2"><span class="nm">1.</span><p>However, if they argue only about Min b'Mino (and also Chachamim forbid if he stirred only at the end), Rebbi should have said 'I agree with R. Yehudah in one case, and disagree in the other'!</p></div>
<div class="subject"><span class="nm">2)</span><p>UDDER</p></div>
<div class="indent1"><span class="nm">(a)</span><p><span class="cl">(Mishnah):</span> One tears the udder to remove the milk. If it was not torn, one (who eats it) does not transgress (a Lav, to be lashed);</p></div>
<div class="indent1"><span class="nm">(b)</span><p>One tears the heart to remove the blood. If it was not torn, he does not transgress.</p></div>

<div class="indent1"><span class="nm">(b)</span><p><span class="cl">Answer (Rav Yehudah):</span> We tear it lengthwise and widthwise, and press it against the wall.</p></div>
<div class="indent1"><span class="nm">(c)</span><p><span class="cl">R. Elazar (to his servant):</span> Tear the udder, and I will eat it.</p></div>

<div class="indent1"><span class="nm">(e)</span><p><span class="cl">Answer (#1):</span> He shows that he argues with Rav Yehudah, who requires tearing lengthwise and widthwise and pressing against the wall.</p></div>
<div class="indent1"><span class="nm">(f)</span><p><span class="cl">(Some texts - Answer #2:</span> One might have thought that the Mishnah requires tearing only when it will be cooked (in liquid, but not if it will be roasted).)</p></div>
<div class="indent1"><span class="nm">(g)</span><p><span class="cl">Yalsa (Rav Nachman's wife):</span> For everything that the Torah forbids, something similar is permitted:</p></div>
<div class="indent2"><span class="nm">1.</span><p>Blood is forbidden, but liver (which is congealed blood) is permitted;</p></div>
<div class="indent2"><span class="nm">2.</span><p>A Nidah is forbidden, but a woman who sees virginal blood or Dam Tohar (after childbirth) is permitted;</p></div>
<div class="indent2"><span class="nm">3.</span><p>Chelev of a Behemah is forbidden, but Chelev of a Chayah is permitted;</p></div>
<div class="indent2"><span class="nm">4.</span><p>Pigs (and Girusa, a Tamei bird) are forbidden, but there are Kosher fish whose brain (and tongue) have the same taste;</p></div>
<div class="indent2"><span class="nm">5.</span><p>A married woman is forbidden, but a divorcee is permitted;</p></div>
<div class="indent2"><span class="nm">6.</span><p>A brother's wife is forbidden, but a Yevamah is permitted;</p></div>
<div class="indent2"><span class="nm">7.</span><p>A Nochris is forbidden, but a Yafes To'ar (beautiful woman taken in war) is permitted;</p></div>

<div class="indent1"><span class="nm">(i)</span><p><span class="cl">Answer:</span> That is if one wants to cook it.</p></div>
<div class="indent1"><span class="nm">(j)</span><p><span class="cl">Question (Beraisa):</span> If an udder was cooked with its milk inside, it is permitted. (Rav Nachman holds like Version #2, so he must hold that in this Beraisa, 'cooked' means roasted.)</p></div>
<div class="indent2"><span class="nm">1.</span><p>That is only b'Di'eved! (Why would Rav Nachman intentionally do so?)</p></div>
<div class="indent1"><span class="nm">(k)</span><p><span class="cl">Answer:</span> Really, it is even l'Chatchilah. Since the Seifa discusses (and forbids, even b'Di'eved) a stomach that was cooked with the milk inside, also the Reisha says 'was cooked'.</p></div>
