<p class="dedicationbox">CHULIN 31-43 - Two weeks of study material have been dedicated by Mrs. Estanne Abraham Fawer to honor the Yahrzeit of her father, Rav Mordechai ben Eliezer Zvi (Rabbi Morton Weiner) Z'L, who passed away on 18 Teves 5760. May the merit of supporting and advancing Dafyomi study -- which was so important to him -- during the weeks of his Yahrzeit serve as an Iluy for his Neshamah. </p>

<div class="subject"><span class="nm">1)</span><p>THE 18 TEREIFOS (cont.)</p></div>
<div class="indent1"><span class="nm">(a)</span><p><span class="cl">(Ula):</span> Eight kinds of Tereifos were taught to Moshe on Sinai: punctures, cuts, missing organs, deficient organs, tears, Drisah, animals that fell, and broken organs.</p></div>
<div class="indent2"><span class="nm">1.</span><p>Ula excludes afflicted organs, i.e. Rachish bar Papa's teaching about an afflicted kidney.</p></div>
<div class="indent1"><span class="nm">(b)</span><p><span class="cl">(Chiya bar Rav):</span> Any of eight punctures makes an animal Tereifah.</p></div>
<div class="indent1"><span class="nm">(c)</span><p><span class="cl">Question:</span> There is a ninth, i.e. a punctured gall bladder!</p></div>
<div class="indent1"><span class="nm">(d)</span><p><span class="cl">Answer:</span> That is according to R. Yosi b'Rebbi Yehudah. The Halachah is not like him.</p></div>
<div class="indent1"><span class="nm">(e)</span><p><span class="cl">(Beraisa):</span> If the Kevah or small intestines were punctured, it is Tereifah;</p></div>
<div class="indent1"><span class="nm">(f)</span><p>R. Yosi b'Rebbi Yehudah says, even if the gall bladder was punctured it is Tereifah.</p></div>
<div class="indent1"><span class="nm">(g)</span><p><span class="cl">(R. Yitzchak b'Rebbi Yosef, citing R. Yochanan):</span> The Halachah follows R. Yosi;</p></div>
<div class="indent2"><span class="nm">1.</span><p><span class="cl">Chachamim (to R. Yosi):</span> Iyov said "My gall bladder spills to the ground", yet he lived!</p></div>
<div class="indent2"><span class="nm">2.</span><p><span class="cl">R. Yosi:</span> We cannot learn from miraculous cases.</p></div>
<div class="indent3"><span class="nm">i.</span><p>Iyov's kidneys were stricken. He could not survive naturally (Tosfos - without a cure)!</p></div>
<div class="indent3"><span class="nm">ii.</span><p>We must say that he was kept alive miraculously. (Hash-m told the Satan) "just guard his soul (keep him alive)."</p></div>
<div class="indent1"><span class="nm">(h)</span><p><span class="cl">(R. Yitzchak b'Rebbi Yosef, citing R. Yochanan):</span> The Halachah is like the opinion that if less than k'Zayis (the volume of an olive) of the liver remains, it is Tereifah.</p></div>
<div class="indent1"><span class="nm">(i)</span><p><span class="cl">Contradiction (Rabah bar bar Chanah, citing R. Yochanan):</span> The Halachah follows a Stam Mishnah.</p></div>
<div class="indent2"><span class="nm">1.</span><p><span class="cl">(Our Mishnah):</span> If the liver was removed and nothing remains (it is Tereifah).</p></div>
<div class="indent2"><span class="nm">2.</span><p><span class="cl">Inference:</span> If anything remains, it is Kosher.</p></div>
<div class="indent2"><span class="nm">3.</span><p><span class="cl">(Summation of contradiction):</span> R. Yochanan should rule like our Stam Mishnah!</p></div>
<div class="indent1"><span class="nm">(j)</span><p><span class="cl">Answer:</span> Amora'im argue about R. Yochanan's opinion. (If he really said (h), he did not say (i).)</p></div>
<div class="indent1"><span class="nm">(k)</span><p><span class="cl">(R. Yitzchak b'Rebbi Yosef, citing R. Yochanan):</span> If the gall bladder was punctured, but the liver seals (covers) the hole, it is Kosher.</p></div>
<div class="indent1"><span class="nm">(l)</span><p><span class="cl">(R. Yitzchak b'Rebbi Yosef, citing R. Yochanan):</span> If the Kurkevan (gizzard, the second stomach of a bird) was punctured, but the inner membrane is intact, it is Kosher.</p></div>
<div class="indent1"><span class="nm">(m)</span><p><span class="cl">Question:</span> If the inner membrane was punctured, but the stomach is intact, what is the law?</p></div>
<div class="indent1"><span class="nm">(n)</span><p><span class="cl">Answer (Rav Nachman):</span> If either one (but not both) is punctured, it is Kosher.</p></div>
<div class="subject"><span class="nm">2)</span><p>TEREIFOS OF THE VESHET</p></div>
<div class="indent1"><span class="nm">(a)</span><p><span class="cl">(Rava):</span> The Veshet has two membranes. The outer is red, and the inner is white. If either one (but not both) is punctured, it is Kosher.</p></div>
<div class="indent2"><span class="nm">1.</span><p><span class="cl">Question:</span> Why must Rava specify which is red and which white?</p></div>
<div class="indent2"><span class="nm">2.</span><p><span class="cl">Answer:</span> If the colors are reversed, it is Tereifah.</p></div>
<div class="indent1"><span class="nm">(b)</span><p><span class="cl">Question:</span> If both membranes are punctured, but in different places, what is the law?</p></div>
<div class="indent1"><span class="nm">(c)</span><p><span class="cl">Answer #1 (Mar Zutra):</span> Regarding the Veshet this is Kosher. Regarding the gizzard it is Tereifah. (Food will go between the membranes and seep to the other hole, and leave.)</p></div>
<div class="indent1"><span class="nm">(d)</span><p><span class="cl">Answer #2 (Rav Ashi):</span> Just the opposite! The Veshet contracts and expands during digestion and breathing. The holes will line up, and there will be a puncture going all the way through. The gizzard is stationary, so the holes will not line up.</p></div>
<div class="indent1"><span class="nm">(e)</span><p><span class="cl">(Rav Acha brei d'Rav Yosef):</span> I heard that also Mar Zutra said like Rav Ashi.</p></div>
<div class="indent1"><span class="nm">(f)</span><p><span class="cl">(Rava):</span> If a scab formed on a wound in the Veshet, this is not considered a seal to be Machshir the animal).</p></div>
<div class="indent1"><span class="nm">(g)</span><p><span class="cl">(Rava):</span> The Veshet cannot be checked from the outside (for it is red. One would not notice a drop of blood due to a puncture.) It is checked only from the inside. (One turns it inside out.)</p></div>
<div class="indent1"><span class="nm">(h)</span><p><span class="cl">Question:</span> To what does Rava's teaching apply?</p></div>
<div class="bbbline">43b----------------------------------------43b</p></div>
<div class="indent1"><span class="nm">(i)</span><p><span class="cl">Answer:</span> It applies to a Safek whether (Rashi - the Veshet was punctured, or) it became Tereifah due to Drisah. (If the venom made the Veshet red, it is Tereifah.)</p></div>
<div class="indent2"><span class="nm">1.</span><p>A doubtfully Nidras bird was brought in front of Rabah. He was checking the Veshet from the outside.</p></div>
<div class="indent2"><span class="nm">2.</span><p><span class="cl">Abaye:</span> You taught that the Veshet can be checked only from the inside!</p></div>
<div class="indent2"><span class="nm">3.</span><p>Rabah checked it from the inside and found blood, which showed that the venom had penetrated. He ruled that it is Tereifah.</p></div>
<div class="indent3"><span class="nm">i.</span><p>Initially, he checked from the outside to see if Abaye would catch the mistake.</p></div>
<div class="indent1"><span class="nm">(j)</span><p><span class="cl">(Ula):</span> If a thorn became stuck in the Veshet, we are not concerned lest it punctured the Veshet and the wound healed. (This would be Tereifah, since the scab is not considered a proper seal.)</p></div>
<div class="indent1"><span class="nm">(k)</span><p><span class="cl">Question:</span> According to Ula, why is this different than a Safek Nidras?</p></div>
<div class="indent1"><span class="nm">(l)</span><p><span class="cl">Answer:</span> Also there, Ula is not concerned.</p></div>
<div class="indent1"><span class="nm">(m)</span><p><span class="cl">Question:</span> Why is this different than two pieces of meat, one of which is Chelev (and we do not know which? There, due to the doubt we may not eat either one!)</p></div>
<div class="indent1"><span class="nm">(n)</span><p><span class="cl">Answer:</span> There, we know that a forbidden piece is there.</p></div>
<div class="indent1"><span class="nm">(o)</span><p><span class="cl">Question:</span> Why is this different than one who slaughters with a checked knife, and finds (after slaughtering) that the knife is blemished? (The animal is forbidden.)</p></div>
<div class="indent1"><span class="nm">(p)</span><p><span class="cl">Answer:</span> There, a problem (definitely) arose in the knife.</p></div>
<div class="indent1"><span class="nm">(q)</span><p><span class="cl">Question:</span> Why is this different than Safek Tum'ah in Reshus ha'Yachid (about which we are stringent)?</p></div>
<div class="indent2"><span class="nm">1.</span><p><span class="cl">Counter-question:</span> Perhaps we should compare it to Safek Tum'ah in Reshus ha'Rabim (about which we are lenient)!</p></div>
<div class="indent2"><span class="nm">2.</span><p><span class="cl">Answer:</span> Safek Tum'ah in Reshus ha'Rabim is a special law learned from Sotah. (We do not learn Isurim from it.)</p></div>
<div class="indent1"><span class="nm">(r)</span><p><span class="cl">(Answer:</span> Also Safek Tum'ah in a Reshus ha'Yachid is a special law learned from Sotah, and we do not learn Isurim from it!)</p></div>
<div class="indent1"><span class="nm">(s)</span><p><span class="cl">(A Chacham):</span> Ula said only that we are not concerned for a thorn found in the Veshet. We would be concerned for one lodged in the Veshet.</p></div>
<div class="indent1"><span class="nm">(t)</span><p><span class="cl">Objection (Rav Kahana):</span> Ula would not need to permit a thorn found in the Veshet. Animals that graze freely eat thorns all the time!</p></div>
<div class="subject"><span class="nm">3)</span><p>TURBATZ VESHET</p></div>
<div class="indent1"><span class="nm">(a)</span><p><span class="cl">(Rav):</span> A puncture in Turbatz Veshet (the place where the Veshet is attached to the jaw) of any size makes the animal Tereifah;</p></div>
<div class="indent2"><span class="nm">1.</span><p>He holds that this is a valid place for Shechitah (like the rest of the Veshet).</p></div>
<div class="indent1"><span class="nm">(b)</span><p><span class="cl">(Shmuel):</span> It is Tereifah only if the majority is cut.</p></div>
<div class="indent2"><span class="nm">1.</span><p>He holds that this is an invalid place for Shechitah.</p></div>
<div class="indent1"><span class="nm">(c)</span><p><span class="cl">Question:</span> Which part of the Veshet is considered Turbatz Veshet?</p></div>
<div class="indent1"><span class="nm">(d)</span><p><span class="cl">Answer #1 (Mari bar Mar Ukva):</span> If one slices it (widthwise) and the cut area expands, this is Turbatz Veshet. If the cut area does not expand, it is the Veshet proper;</p></div>
<div class="indent1"><span class="nm">(e)</span><p><span class="cl">Answer #2 (Rav Papi):</span> If the cut area stays the same size, this is Turbatz Veshet. If the cut area constricts, it is the Veshet proper.</p></div>
<div class="indent1"><span class="nm">(f)</span><p><span class="cl">Version #1 - Answer #3 (Yonah (a Chacham)):</span> Turbatz Veshet is the place where it swallows.</p></div>
<div class="indent1"><span class="nm">(g)</span><p><span class="cl">Version #2 (Zira):</span> In a Yonah (dove), Turbatz Veshet is the place where it swallows. (end of Version #2)</p></div>
<div class="indent1"><span class="nm">(h)</span><p><span class="cl">Question:</span> How far does it extend?</p></div>
<div class="indent1"><span class="nm">(i)</span><p><span class="cl">Answer (Rav Avya):</span> It extends less than the length of a barley seed, but more than a wheat kernel.</p></div>
<div class="indent1"><span class="nm">(j)</span><p>Rav Ukva's children had an ox. The Shechitah started in the Turbatz Veshet, and finished in the Veshet proper.</p></div>
<div class="indent2"><span class="nm">1.</span><p><span class="cl">Rava:</span> I will apply the stringencies of Rav and Shmuel to rule that it is Tereifah.</p></div>
<div class="indent3"><span class="nm">i.</span><p>The stringency of Rav is that a cut of any size in the Turbatz Veshet makes it a Tereifah.</p></div>
<div class="indent3"><span class="nm">ii.</span><p><span class="cl">Question:</span> Rav holds that also Turbatz Veshet is a valid place for Shechitah!</p></div>
<div class="indent3"><span class="nm">iii.</span><p><span class="cl">Answer:</span> Regarding this, Rava rules like Shmuel, that it is not.</p></div>
<div class="indent3"><span class="nm">iv.</span><p><span class="cl">Question:</span> Shmuel holds that only cutting the majority of Turbatz Veshet makes it a Tereifah!</p></div>
<div class="indent3"><span class="nm">v.</span><p><span class="cl">Answer:</span> Regarding this, Rava rules like Rav.</p></div>
<div class="indent1"><span class="nm">(k)</span><p><span class="cl">R. Aba:</span> Both Rav and Shmuel agree that the Shechitah was valid. Rava ruled incorrectly. He must pay the owners for the loss that he caused them.</p></div>
<div class="indent1"><span class="nm">(l)</span><p><span class="cl">Mar brei d'Ravina:</span> A Beraisa refutes Rava!</p></div>
