<div class="indent1"><span class="nm">(b)</span><p><span class="cl">Question:</span> What is the source of this?</p></div>
<div class="indent1"><span class="nm">(c)</span><p><span class="cl">Version #1 - Rashi - Answer (Tana d'Vei R. Yishmael):</span> The floor of the Azarah is Kodesh, and Klei Shares are Kodoshim;</p></div>

<div class="indent2"><span class="nm">1.</span><p>Just like a Chatzitzah between the Kohen and the Klei Shares disqualifies, also between him and the floor.</p></div>

<div class="indent2"><span class="nm">1.</span><p>Had it taught only standing on top of Kelim, one might have thought that this is Chotzetz because Kelim are not flesh, but an animal is not a Chatzitzah;</p></div>
<div class="indent2"><span class="nm">2.</span><p>Had it taught only standing on animals, one might have thought that this is Chotzetz, but standing on a person is not.</p></div>
<div class="indent1"><span class="nm">(f)</span><p><span class="cl">(Beraisa - R. Eliezer):</span> If one foot was on the floor and the other was on top of a Keli or rock, if the Keli or rock could be removed and he could stand on the other foot, the Avodah is Kosher. If not, it is Pasul.</p></div>
