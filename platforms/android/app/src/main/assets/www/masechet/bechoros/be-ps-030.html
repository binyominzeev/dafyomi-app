<p class="bas subject"><span class="nm">1)</span>ONE WHO IS SUSPECTED</p>
<p class="bas indent1"><span class="nm">(a)</span>A certain butcher was suspected of selling forbidden Chelev of the kidney and saying that it is permitted Chelev. Rava fined him, and forbade him to sell even nuts.</p>
<p class="bas indent1"><span class="nm">(b)</span><span class="cl">Rav Papa:</span> Your fine is according to R. Yehudah. If so, you should forbid even water and salt!</p>
<p class="bas indent1"><span class="nm">(c)</span><span class="cl">Rava:</span> No, it is according to R. Shimon. the fine applies only to the Isur;</p>
<p class="bas indent2"><span class="nm">1.</span>Children crave nuts. Reuven gives nuts to butchers' children, in exchange for which they bring to him forbidden Chelev (which their fathers had little use for anyway), and he would sell it.</p>
<p class="bas indent1"><span class="nm">(d)</span><span class="cl">(Mishnah):</span> One who is suspected about Shemitah is not suspected about Ma'aser (Sheni) (Tosfos - to sell it and say that it is Chulin; Rashi - to sell Tevel without separating Ma'aser).</p>
<p class="bas indent1"><span class="nm">(e)</span>One who is suspected about Ma'aser is not suspected about Shemitah;</p>
<p class="bas indent1"><span class="nm">(f)</span>One who is suspected about either of these is suspected about Taharos (not to eat Chulin b'Taharah);</p>
<p class="bas indent1"><span class="nm">(g)</span>Someone can be suspected about Taharos but not about either of these.</p>
<p class="bas indent1"><span class="nm">(h)</span>The general rule is, one who is suspected about a matter cannot judge it nor testify about it.</p>
<p class="bas indent1"><span class="nm">(i)</span><span class="cl">(Gemara) Question:</span> Why is someone suspected about Shemitah not suspected about Ma'aser?</p>
<p class="bas indent1"><span class="nm">(j)</span><span class="cl">Answer:</span> Shemitah need not be eaten within the wall of Yerushalayim, but Ma'aser must. Perhaps he considers Ma'aser to be more stringent.</p>
<p class="bas indent1"><span class="nm">(k)</span><span class="cl">(Mishnah):</span> One who is suspected about Ma'aser...</p>
<p class="bas indent1"><span class="nm">(l)</span><span class="cl">Question:</span> Why is someone suspected about Ma'aser not suspected about Shemitah?</p>
<p class="bas indent1"><span class="nm">(m)</span><span class="cl">Answer:</span> Ma'aser can be redeemed. Shemitah cannot be redeemed once it becomes forbidden (e.g. after Bi'ur). Perhaps he considers Shemitah to be more stringent.</p>
<p class="bas subject"><span class="nm">2)</span>EXTRAPOLATION OF SUSPICION</p>
<p class="bas indent1"><span class="nm">(a)</span><span class="cl">(Mishnah):</span> One who is suspected about either of these (is suspected about Taharos).</p>
<p class="bas indent1"><span class="nm">(b)</span>Since he is suspected to transgress a mid'Oraisa law, all the more so he is suspected about mid'Rabanan laws.</p>
<p class="bas indent1"><span class="nm">(c)</span><span class="cl">(Mishnah):</span> One can be suspected about Taharos (but not about either of these).</p>
<p class="bas indent1"><span class="nm">(d)</span><span class="cl">Question:</span> What is the reason?</p>
<p class="bas indent1"><span class="nm">(e)</span><span class="cl">Answer:</span> Granted, he is suspected about a mid'Rabanan law, but he is not suspected about mid'Oraisa laws.</p>
<p class="bas indent1"><span class="nm">(f)</span><span class="cl">Contradiction (Beraisa):</span> One who is trusted about Taharos is trusted about Shemitah.</p>
<p class="bas indent2"><span class="nm">1.</span><span class="cl">Inference:</span> One who is suspected about Taharos is suspected about Shemitah! (Tosfos - the law itself is obvious. Surely it was taught for the inference.)</p>
<p class="bas indent1"><span class="nm">(g)</span><span class="cl">Answer #1 (R. Ilai):</span> The Mishnah discusses one who was seen to observe Shemitah properly in private, in his house. (Surely, he was not trying to create a false impression!)</p>
<p class="bas indent1"><span class="nm">(h)</span><span class="cl">Answer #2 (R. Yanai, son of R. Yishmael):</span> The Beraisa discusses one who was suspected about Taharos and Shemitah, then accepted in front of Chachamim to be careful about them;</p>
<p class="bas indent2"><span class="nm">1.</span>Later, he was suspected about one of them, therefore he is also suspected about the other.</p>
<p class="bas indent1"><span class="nm">(i)</span><span class="cl">Version #1 (Rabah bar bar Chanah):</span> Our Stam Mishnah is like R. Akiva, but Chachamim say that one who is suspected about Shemitah is suspected about Ma'aser.</p>
<p class="bas indent1"><span class="nm">(j)</span><span class="cl">Question:</span> Who are these Chachamim?</p>
<p class="bas indent1"><span class="nm">(k)</span><span class="cl">Answer:</span> They hold like R. Yehudah. In his area, Shemitah was severe to people;</p>
<p class="bas indent2"><span class="nm">1.</span>There, someone once called someone "convert, son of a convert" (to insult him). The latter responded "I don't eat Shemitah produce like you do!"</p>
<p class="bas indent1"><span class="nm">(l)</span><span class="cl">Version #2 (Rabah bar bar Chanah):</span> Our Stam Mishnah is like R. Akiva, but Chachamim say that one who is suspected about Ma'aser is suspected about Shemitah.</p>
<p class="bas indent1"><span class="nm">(m)</span><span class="cl">Question:</span> Who are these Chachamim?</p>
<p class="bas indent1"><span class="nm">(n)</span><span class="cl">Answer:</span> They hold like R. Meir, who says that one who is suspected about one matter is suspected about every Mitzvah.</p>
<p class="bas indent1"><span class="nm">(o)</span>R. Yonah or R. Yirmeyah explained like Version #1, and the other explained like Version #2.</p>
<p class="bas bbbline">30b----------------------------------------30b</p>
<p class="bas subject"><span class="nm">3)</span>CHAVERUS</p>
<p class="bas indent1"><span class="nm">(a)</span>(A Chaver may not give tithes to an Am ha'Aretz (a non-Chaver), nor deal with Taharos with an Am ha'Aretz. He eats Chulin in Taharah, and he tithes what he eats, and what he sells to and buys from an Am ha'Aretz.)</p>
<p class="bas indent1"><span class="nm">(b)</span><span class="cl">(Beraisa):</span> If an ignoramus accepted Chaverus, and he is suspected of one matter, he is suspected about everything</p>
<p class="bas indent1"><span class="nm">(c)</span>Chachamim say, he is suspected only about that matter.</p>
<p class="bas indent1"><span class="nm">(d)</span>If a Nochri converted and accepted the entire Torah, and he is suspected of one matter, he is suspected about everything. He is like a Yisrael Mumar.</p>
<p class="bas indent2"><span class="nm">1.</span><span class="cl">Question:</span> What do we learn from this?</p>
<p class="bas indent2"><span class="nm">2.</span><span class="cl">Answer:</span> If he was Mekadesh a woman, she is Mekudeshes.</p>
<p class="bas indent1"><span class="nm">(e)</span><span class="cl">(Beraisa):</span> If one wants to be a Chaver, and he accepts Chaverus except for one matter, we do not accept him. (In every case, "acceptance" means that we trust him.)</p>
<p class="bas indent1"><span class="nm">(f)</span>R. Yosi b'Rebbi Yehudah says, even if he does not accept one Rabbinic law, we do not accept him.</p>
<p class="bas indent1"><span class="nm">(g)</span>Similarly, if a Levi or Kohen accepts all matters of Leviyah or Kehunah except for one matter, we do not accept him - "ha'Makriv Es Dam ha'Shelamim (Lo Sihyeh... l'Manah)";</p>
<p class="bas indent2"><span class="nm">1.</span>If a Kohen does not admit to all the Avodos assigned to Bnei Aharon, he has no share in Kehunah.</p>
<p class="bas indent1"><span class="nm">(h)</span><span class="cl">(Beraisa):</span> If one wants to be a Chaver:</p>
<p class="bas indent2"><span class="nm">1.</span>If we already saw him conduct like a Chaver covertly in his house, we accept him immediately, and then teach him all the laws;</p>
<p class="bas indent2"><span class="nm">2.</span>If not, first we teach him all the laws, and then we accept him.</p>
<p class="bas indent1"><span class="nm">(i)</span>R. Shimon says, in either case we accept him immediately. He will learn the laws over time.</p>
<p class="bas indent1"><span class="nm">(j)</span><span class="cl">(Beraisa):</span> We accept one who agrees to wash his hands (before eating bread or touching Terumah), and later he will accept all laws of Taharah;</p>
<p class="bas indent2"><span class="nm">1.</span>If he agrees only to wash his hands, we accept him;</p>
<p class="bas indent2"><span class="nm">2.</span>If he agrees to observe all matters of Taharah except for washing his hands, we do not accept him. (Washing is easy. If he cannot keep this, surely he cannot keep all the other laws!)</p>
<p class="bas indent1"><span class="nm">(k)</span><span class="cl">Version #1 - (Beraisa) Question:</span> What is the minimal acceptance?</p>
<p class="bas indent1"><span class="nm">(l)</span><span class="cl">Version #2 - (Beraisa) Question:</span> How long must one keep the laws covertly in order that we will accept him immediately? (end of Version #2)</p>
<p class="bas indent1"><span class="nm">(m)</span><span class="cl">Answer #1:</span> Beis Shamai say, for (trusting him concerning) Tum'ah of liquids (which is only mid'Rabanan) 30 days suffice. For his garments (to assume that they are Tehorim), we require 12 months;</p>
<p class="bas indent1"><span class="nm">(n)</span><span class="cl">Answer #2:</span> Beis Hillel say, both of these require 12 months.</p>
<p class="bas indent1"><span class="nm">(o)</span><span class="cl">Objection:</span> If so, Beis Hillel are more stringent than Beis Shamai. If so, this should have been taught in Eduyos (with the other places where Beis Hillel are more stringent)!</p>
<p class="bas indent1"><span class="nm">(p)</span><span class="cl">Correction:</span> Rather, Beis Hillel say that 30 days suffice for both.</p>
<p class="bas subject"><span class="nm">4)</span>ACCEPTANCE OF <i>CHAVERUS</i></p>
<p class="bas indent1"><span class="nm">(a)</span><span class="cl">(Beraisa):</span> Acceptance of Chaverus must be in front of three Chaverim;</p>
<p class="bas indent1"><span class="nm">(b)</span>His children and household (wife and slaves) need not accept in front of three.</p>
<p class="bas indent1"><span class="nm">(c)</span>R. Shimon ben Gamliel says, his children and household must accept in front of three;</p>
<p class="bas indent2"><span class="nm">1.</span>The acceptance of a Chaver is unlike the acceptance of his son. (Since the son's acceptance is merely due to his father, we must not make it lighter than his father's. Also it requires three. Alternatively, the first Tana taught this clause. A son need not accept at all. Certainly he will conduct like his father!)</p>
<p class="bas indent1"><span class="nm">(d)</span><span class="cl">(Beraisa):</span> Acceptance of Chaverus must be in front of three Chaverim;</p>
<p class="bas indent1"><span class="nm">(e)</span>Even a Chacham must accept in front of three. A Chacham who learns (full time) in Beis Medrash need not accept in front of three, for he already accepted when he started to learn.</p>
<p class="bas indent1"><span class="nm">(f)</span>Aba Sha'ul says, a Chacham need not accept. Further, others can accept in front of a Chacham!</p>
<p class="bas indent1"><span class="nm">(g)</span><span class="cl">(R. Yochanan):</span> This Beraisa was taught in the time of the son of R. Chanina ben Antignos:</p>
<p class="bas indent2"><span class="nm">1.</span>A case occurred in which R. Yehudah and R. Yosi had a question about Taharos. They sent two Chachamim to ask R. Chanina's son.</p>
<p class="bas indent2"><span class="nm">2.</span>They found him engaging in Taharos. They asked him the question. He picked Chaverim among his Talmidim to watch the Taharos, and investigated the question.</p>
<p class="bas indent2"><span class="nm">3.</span>R. Yehudah was upset that R. Chanina's son did not trust the Chachamim sent to him. He said "he and his father disgrace Chachamim!" (Tosfos - a similar case had occurred with his father; Rashi - the charge against his father was false. It was added out of anger.)</p>
<p class="bas indent2"><span class="nm">4.</span><span class="cl">R. Yosi:</span> Do not be upset. After the Churban, Kohanim are extra strict. They entrust Taharos only to one who accepted Chaverus.</p>
<p class="bas indent1"><span class="nm">(h)</span><span class="cl">(Beraisa):</span> If a Chaver died, his children and household retain their Chazakah (of being Chaverim), until we see reason to suspect them;</p>
<p class="bas indent1"><span class="nm">(i)</span>If Techeles was sold in a Chatzer and it was Muchzak to be authentic, it retains its Chazakah until we see reason to suspect (that they sell imitation Techeles, e.g. from the indigo plant).</p>
<p class="bas indent1"><span class="nm">(j)</span><span class="cl">(Beraisa):</span> If an Am ha'Aretz's wife (who was widowed or divorced) or daughter married a Chaver, or if an Am ha'Aretz's slave was sold to a Chaver, (s)he must accept Chaverus;</p>
<p class="bas indent1"><span class="nm">(k)</span>If a Chaver's daughter or wife married an Am ha'Aretz, or if a Chaver's slave was sold to an Am ha'Aretz, (s)he need not accept Chaverus (if (s)he returns to a Chaver);</p>
<p class="bas indent1"><span class="nm">(l)</span>R. Meir requires accepting Chaverus.</p>
<p class="bas indent2"><span class="nm">1.</span><span class="cl">R. Shimon ben Elazar citing R. Meir:</span> A case occurred in which a woman was married to a Chaver. She bound Tefilin on his hand. Later, she married to an Am ha'Aretz, and tied tax collector's seals on his arm. (Tax collectors are assumed to steal. This shows that if a righteous woman marries a Rasha, she is prone to become evil.)</p>
