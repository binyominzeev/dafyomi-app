<p class="bas subject"><span class="nm">1)</span>PRAT U'CHLAL U'FRAT</p>
<p class="bas indent1"><span class="nm">(a)</span><span class="cl">Question:</span> R. Eliezer ben Azaryah expounds "me'Chartzanim v'Ad Zag" to teach that one is liable only for eating two pits and a peel. What is his source for the above rule of Prat u'Chlal u'Frat?</p>
<p class="bas indent1"><span class="nm">(b)</span><span class="cl">Answer #1:</span> He expounds like R. Eliezer, via Ribuy and Mi'ut.</p>
<p class="bas indent1"><span class="nm">(c)</span><span class="cl">Answer #2:</span> He expounds like Chachamim. If "me'Chartzanim v'Ad Zag" only came to teach about two pits and one peel, it would have been written with the other Peratim;</p>
<p class="bas indent2"><span class="nm">1.</span>It was written after the Klal to also teach the above rule.</p>
<p class="bas indent2"><span class="nm">2.</span><span class="cl">Suggestion:</span> Perhaps it teaches only the rule!</p>
<p class="bas indent2"><span class="nm">3.</span><span class="cl">Rejection:</span> If so, it would have said "me'Chartzanim v'Ad Zagim" or "me'Chartzan v'Ad Zag";</p>
<p class="bas indent3"><span class="nm">i.</span>Rather, it says "me'Chartzanim v'Ad Zag" to also teach two pits and one peel.</p>
<p class="bas indent1"><span class="nm">(d)</span><span class="cl">Question:</span> R. Eliezer expounded via Ribuy and Mi'ut. What is his source for the rule of Prat u'Chlal u'Frat? (We do not find that he argues about everything expounded this way!)</p>
<p class="bas indent1"><span class="nm">(e)</span><span class="cl">Answer #1 (R. Avahu):</span> "When a man will give to his friend a donkey, ox or sheep" is a Prat. "Or any animal" is a Klal. "To guard" is another Prat;</p>
<p class="bas indent2"><span class="nm">1.</span>From a Prat u'Chlal u'Frat we include only what resembles the Peratim. (Chachamim consider "will give" to be a Klal, and call this a Klal u'Frat u'Chlal. All include what resembles the Prat, and exclude slaves, documents and land.)</p>
<p class="bas indent1"><span class="nm">(f)</span><span class="cl">Answer #2 (Rava):</span> "If from" is a Prat. "The flock" is a Klal. "Sheep and goats" is a Prat;</p>
<p class="bas indent2"><span class="nm">1.</span>From a Prat u'Chlal u'Frat we include only what resembles the Peratim (any animal whose body was used for a sin, e.g. bestiality, is Pasul for a Korban. The Rosh does not understand how we learn this from the Peratim. Tosfos connotes that this is the most reasonable Mi'ut to exclude from "from".)</p>
<p class="bas indent1"><span class="nm">(g)</span><span class="cl">Question (Rav Yehudah mi'Diskarta):</span> Why didn't you say that he learns from an earlier verse? "From" is a Prat. "Beheimah (domestic animals)" is a Klal. "Cattle or flock" - is a Prat;</p>
<p class="bas indent2"><span class="nm">1.</span>From a Prat u'Chlal u'Frat we include only what resembles the Peratim (Beheimos, but not Chayos, i.e. wild animals)!</p>
<p class="bas indent1"><span class="nm">(h)</span><span class="cl">Answer (Rava):</span> We cannot exclude Chayos from "Beheimah", for they are included in "Beheimah"!</p>
<p class="bas bbbline">35b----------------------------------------35b</p>
<p class="bas indent1"><span class="nm">(i)</span><span class="cl">Objection (Rav Yehudah):</span> Even if you say so, the verse concludes "cattle and flock." It is a Prat u'Chlal u'Frat. We include what resembles (all) the Peratim. (The last Peratim are Beheimos.)</p>
<p class="bas indent1"><span class="nm">(j)</span><span class="cl">Question:</span> What is the source that a Klal u'Frat u'Chlal includes only what resembles the Peratim? (See (e:1) above.)</p>
<p class="bas indent1"><span class="nm">(k)</span><span class="cl">Answer (Beraisa):</span> "You will spend the money (of Ma'aser Sheni) on whatever your soul desires" is a Klal. "On cattle, flock, wine and strong drink" is a Prat; "And all that your soul asks" is a Klal;</p>
<p class="bas indent2"><span class="nm">1.</span>From a Prat u'Chlal u'Frat we include only what resembles the Peratim. The Peratim reproduce and are nourished from the ground. We include all such things.</p>
<p class="bas subject"><span class="nm">2)</span>WHY EACH TERM IS NEEDED</p>
<p class="bas indent1"><span class="nm">(a)</span><span class="cl">Question:</span> From a Klal u'Frat u'Chlal we include what resembles the Peratim. Why is the latter Klal needed?</p>
<p class="bas indent1"><span class="nm">(b)</span><span class="cl">Answer:</span> It includes whatever resembles the Peratim. If not for the latter Klal, we would include only the Peratim.</p>
<p class="bas indent1"><span class="nm">(c)</span><span class="cl">Question:</span> From a Prat u'Chlal u'Frat we include only what resembles the Peratim. Why is the latter Prat needed?</p>
<p class="bas indent1"><span class="nm">(d)</span><span class="cl">Answer:</span> If not for the latter Prat, we would include everything.</p>
<p class="bas indent1"><span class="nm">(e)</span><span class="cl">Question:</span> We include only what resembles the Peratim from a Klal u'Frat u'Chlal, and also from a Prat u'Chlal u'Frat. What is the difference between them?</p>
<p class="bas indent1"><span class="nm">(f)</span><span class="cl">Answer:</span> When there are two Kelalim and one Prat, we include what resembles the Prat in even one respect. When there are two Peratim and one Klal, we only include what resembles the Prat in two respects.</p>
<p class="bas indent1"><span class="nm">(g)</span><span class="cl">Question:</span> From a Prat u'Chlal' we include everything. We also include everything from a Mi'ut v'Ribuy. What is the difference between them?</p>
<p class="bas indent1"><span class="nm">(h)</span><span class="cl">Answer:</span> From a Prat u'Chlal' we include (everything,) even leaves and shoots. From a Mi'ut v'Ribuy we include shoots, but not leaves.</p>
<p class="bas subject"><span class="nm">3)</span><i>HETER</i> JOINS TO <i>ISUR</i></p>
<p class="bas indent1"><span class="nm">(a)</span><span class="cl">(R. Avahu citing R. Yochanan):</span> Heter (what is permitted) joins to Isur (what is forbidden, to comprise a Shi'ur (quantity) to be liable) only regarding Isurei Nazir, for the Torah said "Mishras". (A Nazir is liable for eating bread that absorbed wine.)</p>
