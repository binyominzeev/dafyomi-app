<p class="bas subject"><span class="nm">1)</span>ACHRAYUS</p>
<p class="bas indent1"><span class="nm">(a)</span><span class="cl">(Abaye):</span> If Reuven sold land to Shimon without Achrayus, and others protested, claiming that it is theirs:</p>
<p class="bas indent2"><span class="nm">1.</span>Before Shimon makes a Chazakah, he can retract from the purchase. After making a Chazakah, he cannot.</p>
<p class="bas indent1"><span class="nm">(b)</span><span class="cl">Question:</span> What is the reason?</p>
<p class="bas indent1"><span class="nm">(c)</span><span class="cl">Answer:</span> Reuven can say 'you knew that you were taking a chance.'</p>
<p class="bas indent1"><span class="nm">(d)</span><span class="cl">Question:</span> What is considered a Chazakah (regarding this law)?</p>
<p class="bas indent1"><span class="nm">(e)</span><span class="cl">Answer:</span> It is when he walks around the borders.</p>
<p class="bas indent1"><span class="nm">(f)</span><span class="cl">Version #1:</span> This applies only if Shimon bought without Achrayus. If he bought with Achrayus, he can retract.</p>
<p class="bas indent1"><span class="nm">(g)</span><span class="cl">Version #2:</span> Even if he bought with Achrayus, Reuven can say 'when they legally take it from you, I will return your money.'</p>
<p class="bas subject"><span class="nm">2)</span>THINGS WORTH MONEY</p>
<p class="bas indent1"><span class="nm">(a)</span><span class="cl">(Rav Huna):</span> Damages are paid with money or Idis.</p>
<p class="bas indent1"><span class="nm">(b)</span><span class="cl">Question (Rav Nachman - Beraisa):</span> "He will return" teaches that (anything) worth money may be given, even bran.</p>
<p class="bas indent1"><span class="nm">(c)</span><span class="cl">Answer:</span> The Beraisa discusses when the damager has no money or land.</p>
<p class="bas indent1"><span class="nm">(d)</span><span class="cl">Question:</span> If so, surely he may pay with anything!</p>
<p class="bas indent1"><span class="nm">(e)</span><span class="cl">Answer:</span> One might have thought that he must sell his things so that he can pay with money. The Beraisa teaches that this is not so.</p>
<p class="bas indent1"><span class="nm">(f)</span><span class="cl">(Rav Asi):</span> Money is like land.</p>
<p class="bas indent1"><span class="nm">(g)</span><span class="cl">Question:</span> What did Rav Asi come to teach?</p>
<p class="bas indent2"><span class="nm">1.</span><span class="cl">Suggestion:</span> He teaches that a damager may pay with money or Idis.</p>
<p class="bas indent2"><span class="nm">2.</span><span class="cl">Rejection:</span> This is what Rav Huna taught!</p>
<p class="bas indent1"><span class="nm">(h)</span><span class="cl">Answer #1:</span> Rather, two brothers divided an inheritance. Reuven took land, and Shimon took money. A creditor (of the father) took the land. Shimon must compensate Reuven him with money equal to half the value of the land taken.</p>
<p class="bas indent1"><span class="nm">(i)</span><span class="cl">Version #1 - Objection:</span> This is obvious. Surely, both brothers must pay the debt!</p>
<p class="bas indent1"><span class="nm">(j)</span><span class="cl">Version #2 - Objection:</span> Shimon need not compensate him. He can say 'I took money, knowing that you would not compensate me if it were stolen;</p>
<p class="bas indent2"><span class="nm">1.</span>Likewise, you knew that if a creditor would collect the land, I would not compensate you!</p>
<p class="bas indent1"><span class="nm">(k)</span><span class="cl">Answer #2:</span> Rather, two brothers divided an inheritance. A creditor took Reuven's portion. (Shimon may compensate him with money or land.)</p>
<p class="bas indent1"><span class="nm">(l)</span><span class="cl">Objection:</span> Rav Asi already taught this!</p>
<p class="bas indent2"><span class="nm">1.</span><span class="cl">(Rav):</span> If two brothers divided an inheritance, and a creditor took Reuven's portion, the division is nullified.</p>
<p class="bas indent2"><span class="nm">2.</span><span class="cl">(Shmuel):</span> Reuven is not compensated.</p>
<p class="bas indent2"><span class="nm">3.</span><span class="cl">(Rav Asi):</span> Reuven receives a fourth of the value (of what he lost) in money, v'Revi'a (and/or a fourth) in land.</p>
<p class="bas indent3"><span class="nm">i.</span>Rav says that the division is nullified. He holds that brothers who divided are like heirs. (They make a new division on what remains).</p>
<p class="bas indent3"><span class="nm">ii.</span>Shmuel says that Reuven is not compensated. He holds that brothers who divided are like buyers (without Achrayus).</p>
<p class="bas indent3"><span class="nm">iii.</span><span class="cl">Version #1:</span> Rav Asi says that Reuven receives a fourth in money or a fourth in land. He is unsure whether brothers are like heirs or like buyers (without Achrayus).</p>
<p class="bas indent3"><span class="nm">iv.</span><span class="cl">Version #2:</span> Rav Asi says that Reuven receives a fourth in money and a fourth in land. He is unsure whether brothers are like heirs or like buyers (with Achrayus).)</p>
<p class="bas indent1"><span class="nm">(m)</span><span class="cl">Answer #3:</span> Rav Asi taught that a damager may pay with money or Idis.</p>
<p class="bas indent1"><span class="nm">(n)</span><span class="cl">Question:</span> That is what Rav Huna taught!</p>
<p class="bas indent1"><span class="nm">(o)</span><span class="cl">Answer:</span> Indeed, it should say 'Rav Asi also taught...'</p>
<p class="bas subject"><span class="nm">3)</span>BEAUTIFYING <i>MITZVOS</i></p>
<p class="bas indent1"><span class="nm">(a)</span><span class="cl">(R. Zeira):</span> One must spend up to a third for Mitzvos.</p>
<p class="bas indent1"><span class="nm">(b)</span><span class="cl">Question:</span> What does this mean?</p>
<p class="bas bbbline">9b----------------------------------------9b</p>
<p class="bas indent2"><span class="nm">1.</span><span class="cl">Suggestion:</span> One must spend a third of his wealth to fulfill a Mitzvah.</p>
<p class="bas indent2"><span class="nm">2.</span><span class="cl">Rejection:</span> It is unreasonable that if one encounters three (expensive) Mitzvos, he must exhaust all his wealth!</p>
<p class="bas indent1"><span class="nm">(c)</span><span class="cl">Correction (R. Zeira):</span> One must spend an extra third to beautify a Mitzvah.</p>
<p class="bas indent1"><span class="nm">(d)</span><span class="cl">Question (Rav Ashi):</span> Is this a third of what the plain Mitzvah costs, or a third of the beautified Mitzvah?</p>
<p class="bas indent2"><span class="nm">1.</span>This question is unresolved.</p>
<p class="bas indent1"><span class="nm">(e)</span><span class="cl">(Chachamim of Eretz Yisrael, citing R. Zeira):</span> Up to an extra third, one spends his own money to beautify a Mitzvah. Above a third, Hash-m returns the money to him (in this world).</p>
<p class="bas subject"><span class="nm">4)</span>GENERAL RULES OF DAMAGES</p>
<p class="bas indent1"><span class="nm">(a)</span><span class="cl">(Mishnah):</span> Anything that a man must guard, he must pay if it damages;</p>
<p class="bas indent2"><span class="nm">1.</span>Anything for which he must pay some of the damage it causes, he is responsible for all the damage.</p>
<p class="bas indent1"><span class="nm">(b)</span><span class="cl">(There is compensation for the following, if they are damaged):</span> property to which Me'ilah does not apply; property of members of the covenant; owned property.</p>
<p class="bas indent1"><span class="nm">(c)</span>(One must pay for damage) in any place, except for the premises of the damager, or the joint property of the damager and victim.</p>
<p class="bas indent1"><span class="nm">(d)</span>When one damages, he must pay with Idis.</p>
<p class="bas indent1"><span class="nm">(e)</span><span class="cl">(Gemara - Beraisa):</span> Anything a man must guard, he must pay if it damages.</p>
<p class="bas indent2"><span class="nm">1.</span>If Reuven handed over an ox or pit to a Cheresh (deaf-mute), lunatic or child, and the ox or pit damaged, Reuven must pay. This is not true regarding fire.</p>
<p class="bas indent1"><span class="nm">(f)</span><span class="cl">Question:</span> What is the case?</p>
<p class="bas indent2"><span class="nm">1.</span><span class="cl">Suggestion:</span> The ox is tied up and the pit is covered. The corresponding case of fire is (entrusting a Cheresh, lunatic or child with) a coal.</p>
<p class="bas indent2"><span class="nm">2.</span><span class="cl">Rejection:</span> If so, Reuven should be exempt in all cases!</p>
<p class="bas indent1"><span class="nm">(g)</span><span class="cl">Answer #1:</span> Rather, the ox is loose and the pit is uncovered. The corresponding case of fire is a flame.</p>
<p class="bas indent1"><span class="nm">(h)</span><span class="cl">Rejection:</span> If so, why is Reuven exempt for fire?!</p>
<p class="bas indent2"><span class="nm">1.</span><span class="cl">(Reish Lakish):</span> (A Mishnah teaches that if Reuven sent a fire with a Cheresh, lunatic or child, and the fire damaged, Beis Din cannot make Reuven pay.) This is only if he sent a coal;</p>
<p class="bas indent2"><span class="nm">2.</span>If he sent a flame, Beis Din forces Reuven to pay, because a flame is likely to damage.</p>
<p class="bas indent1"><span class="nm">(i)</span><span class="cl">Answer #2:</span> Really, the ox is tied up and the pit is covered. The case of fire is a coal.</p>
<p class="bas indent2"><span class="nm">1.</span>Reuven is liable if the ox or pit damage, for oxen break loose on their own, and pits become uncovered by themselves, but a coal dies out if left to itself!</p>
<p class="bas indent1"><span class="nm">(j)</span><span class="cl">Question:</span> R. Yochanan says, even if Reuven sent a flame (with a Cheresh, lunatic or child) he is exempt. The corresponding cases of an ox and pit are a loose ox and an uncovered pit. Why is Reuven liable for the ox and pit more than the flame?</p>
<p class="bas indent1"><span class="nm">(k)</span><span class="cl">Answer:</span> Regarding the flame, we attribute the damage to the way the Cheresh (or lunatic or child) held it. (Regarding the ox or pit, the Cheresh did not cause the damage.)</p>
