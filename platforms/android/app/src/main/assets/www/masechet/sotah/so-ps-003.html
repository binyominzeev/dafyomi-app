<p class="bas subject"><span class="nm">1)</span>IS IT PROPER TO WARN?</p>
<p class="bas indent1"><span class="nm">(a)</span><span class="cl">Inference:</span> Reish Lakish and Rav Yemar both forbid warning.</p>
<p class="bas indent1"><span class="nm">(b)</span><span class="cl">Question:</span> According to the opinion that permits warning, what does Kinuy mean?</p>
<p class="bas indent1"><span class="nm">(c)</span><span class="cl">Answer (Rav Nachman bar Yitzchak):</span> It is an expression of warning - "Hash-m warned about his land."</p>
<p class="bas indent1"><span class="nm">(d)</span><span class="cl">(Beraisa - R. Meir):</span> If one does a sin in private, Hash-m publicizes it;</p>
<p class="bas indent2"><span class="nm">1.</span>"V'Avar (will pass) on him a spirit of Kin'ah" is an expression of announcing - "va'Ya'aviru (they passed) a proclamation in the camp."</p>
<p class="bas indent1"><span class="nm">(e)</span><span class="cl">(Reish Lakish):</span> One sins only if a spirit of lunacy enters him - "a man whose wife Sishteh (will stray)" - it is written Sishteh (like the word Shotah, a lunatic, and not 'Sateh' or 'Sisteh' ).</p>
<p class="bas indent1"><span class="nm">(f)</span><span class="cl">(Tana d'Vei R. Yishmael):</span> The Torah believed one witness about a Sotah because there are grounds to believe him. She was warned, she was secluded, and one witness says that she became Temei'ah.</p>
<p class="bas indent1"><span class="nm">(g)</span><span class="cl">Question (Rav Papa):</span> The Torah mentions warning after seclusion and Tum'ah</p>
<p class="bas indent1"><span class="nm">(h)</span><span class="cl">Answer (Abaye):</span> "V'Avar (passed) on him a spirit of Kin'ah" - the spirit already passed (before seclusion and Tum'ah).</p>
<p class="bas indent1"><span class="nm">(i)</span><span class="cl">Question:</span> If V'Avar means 'already passed', we should say the same about "V'Avar every armed soldier" (but this was before Bnei Gad and Bnei Reuven crossed the Yarden)!</p>
<p class="bas indent1"><span class="nm">(j)</span><span class="cl">Answer:</span> There, it says "You will conquer... later, you will return." This shows that "V'Avar" means 'will pass,'</p>
<p class="bas indent2"><span class="nm">1.</span>Here, "V'Avar" cannot mean 'passed (afterwards)', if seclusion and Tum'ah already occurred, there is no reason for warning!</p>
<p class="bas indent1"><span class="nm">(k)</span><span class="cl">(Tana d'Vei R. Yishmael):</span> A man does not warn his wife until a spirit enters him - "passed on him a spirit of Kin'ah, and he warned his wife."</p>
<p class="bas indent1"><span class="nm">(l)</span><span class="cl">Question:</span> What kind of spirit passed on him?</p>
<p class="bas indent1"><span class="nm">(m)</span><span class="cl">Answer #1 (Rabanan):</span> It was a spirit of Tum'ah.</p>
<p class="bas indent1"><span class="nm">(n)</span><span class="cl">Answer #2 (Rav Ashi):</span> It was a spirit of Taharah.</p>
<p class="bas indent1"><span class="nm">(o)</span><span class="cl">Support (for Rav Ashi - Beraisa - R. Yishmael):</span> "He warned his wife" - this is optional (if he sees her acting improperly);</p>
<p class="bas indent2"><span class="nm">1.</span>R. Akiva says, it is an obligation.</p>
<p class="bas indent2"><span class="nm">2.</span>This is like the opinion that it was a spirit of Taharah.</p>
<p class="bas indent2"><span class="nm">3.</span>It would not be optional or an obligation to put a spirit of Tum'ah on oneself!</p>
<p class="bas subject"><span class="nm">2)</span>OPTIONAL AND OBLIGATORY <i>MITZVOS</i></p>
<p class="bas indent1"><span class="nm">(a)</span><span class="cl">(Beraisa - R. Yishmael):</span> "He warned his wife" is optional;</p>
<p class="bas indent1"><span class="nm">(b)</span>R. Akiva says, it is an obligation.</p>
<p class="bas indent1"><span class="nm">(c)</span>R. Yishmael says, "he (a Kohen) will become Tamei for her (his deceased sister)" is optional;</p>
<p class="bas indent1"><span class="nm">(d)</span>R. Akiva says, it is an obligation.</p>
<p class="bas indent1"><span class="nm">(e)</span>R. Yishmael says, "(Kena'ani slaves) will work for you forever" is optional;</p>
<p class="bas indent1"><span class="nm">(f)</span>R. Akiva says, it is an obligation (i.e. one may not needlessly free them).</p>
<p class="bas indent1"><span class="nm">(g)</span><span class="cl">Question (Rav Papa):</span> Does R. Yishmael say that all positive Mitzvos are optional, and R. Akiva say they are all obligatory?</p>
<p class="bas indent1"><span class="nm">(h)</span><span class="cl">Answer (Abaye):</span> No. Only in these three cases, they argue about how to interpret the verses.</p>
<p class="bas indent1"><span class="nm">(i)</span>Regarding "he warned his wife", R. Yishmael holds like the following Tana:</p>
<p class="bas indent2"><span class="nm">1.</span><span class="cl">(Beraisa - R. Eliezer ben Yakov) Suggestion:</span> Perhaps "do not hate your brother in your heart" applies even to a wife who deviates from the modest ways of Benos Yisrael!</p>
<p class="bas indent2"><span class="nm">2.</span><span class="cl">Rejection:</span> "Passed on him a spirit of Kin'ah, and he warned his wife" (it is permitted).</p>
<p class="bas indent2"><span class="nm">3.</span>R. Akiva holds that another verse says "he warned", to make this obligatory.</p>
<p class="bas indent2"><span class="nm">4.</span>R. Yishmael holds that since the Torah needed to write the cases when she is innocent and guilty, it said "he warned" in both cases. We do not expound the repetition;</p>
<p class="bas indent3"><span class="nm">i.</span><span class="cl">(Tana d'Vei R. Yishmael):</span> If a Parshah was repeated in the Torah, it was repeated only for the new law taught. (We need not expound everything repeated.)</p>
<p class="bas indent1"><span class="nm">(j)</span><span class="cl">(Beraisa - R. Yishmael):</span> "He will become Tamei for her" is optional (a Kohen may become Tamei to engage in burial of his deceased sister);</p>
<p class="bas indent1"><span class="nm">(k)</span>R. Akiva says, it is obligatory.</p>
<p class="bas indent2"><span class="nm">1.</span>R. Yishmael holds that since Kohanim are normally forbidden to become Tamei, the Torah needed to permit a Kohen to become Tamei to his close relatives;</p>
<p class="bas indent2"><span class="nm">2.</span>R. Akiva holds that "to his close kin" permits. "He will become Tamei to her" obligates.</p>
<p class="bas indent2"><span class="nm">3.</span>R. Yishmael agrees that "to his close kin" permits. "He will become Tamei for her" forbids Tum'ah for her limbs (Rashi - that fell off in her lifetime; Tosfos - if the corpse is incomplete).</p>
<p class="bas bbbline">3b----------------------------------------3b</p>
<p class="bas indent2"><span class="nm">4.</span>R. Akiva holds that we could have learned that from just "for her." "He will become Tamei" makes it mandatory.</p>
<p class="bas indent2"><span class="nm">5.</span>R. Yishmael holds that since the Torah needed to write "to her", it also said "he will become Tamei." We do not learn from the other repeated words.</p>
<p class="bas indent1"><span class="nm">(l)</span><span class="cl">(Beraisa - R. Yishmael):</span> "You will indenture ba'Hem (them, i.e. Kena'ani slaves) forever" is optional;</p>
<p class="bas indent1"><span class="nm">(m)</span>R. Akiva says, it is obligatory.</p>
<p class="bas indent2"><span class="nm">1.</span>R. Yishmael holds that since it says "do not leave any soul (of the seven Kena'ani nations) alive", "you will indenture ba'Hem forever" is needed to permit (keeping alive and) buying for a slave someone whose mother is a Kena'ani, but his father is not.</p>
<p class="bas indent3"><span class="nm">i.</span><span class="cl">(Beraisa):</span> "Also from the children of the settlers who live with you, you may buy slaves" - you may (keep him alive and) buy for a slave the child of a Kena'anis mother if the father is not a Kena'ani.</p>
<p class="bas indent3"><span class="nm">ii.</span><span class="cl">Suggestion:</span> Perhaps one may buy the child of a Kena'ani if the mother is not a Kena'anis!</p>
<p class="bas indent3"><span class="nm">iii.</span><span class="cl">Rejection:</span> "Who were born in your land", but (their fathers) do not live (permanently) in your land.</p>
<p class="bas indent2"><span class="nm">2.</span>R. Akiva holds that "also from the children... you may buy" permits. "You will indenture them forever" makes it obligatory.</p>
<p class="bas indent2"><span class="nm">3.</span>R. Yishmael holds that "ba'Hem" excludes your brethren (you may not indenture a Yisrael like a Kena'ani slave).</p>
<p class="bas indent2"><span class="nm">4.</span>R. Akiva learns this from "you will not make your brethren, Bnei Yisrael, work rigorously."</p>
<p class="bas indent2"><span class="nm">5.</span>R. Yishmael holds that it says "ba'Hem" for parallel structure with "one will not force to work rigorously Bo (with) his brother." We do not expound "ba'Hem."</p>
<p class="bas subject"><span class="nm">3)</span>THE RESULTS OF SIN</p>
<p class="bas indent1"><span class="nm">(a)</span><span class="cl">(Rav Chisda):</span> Adultery in the house (consumes the money) like a worm consumes sesame. The same applies to anger in the house.</p>
<p class="bas indent2"><span class="nm">1.</span>Both of these apply to the wife. They are not problems in the husband.</p>
<p class="bas indent1"><span class="nm">(b)</span><span class="cl">(Rav Chisda):</span> Before Yisrael sinned, the Divine Presence dwelled with each person - "Hash-m goes amidst your camp";</p>
<p class="bas indent2"><span class="nm">1.</span>After they sinned, the Divine Presence departed from them - "(Hash-m) will not see in you an immoral matter, and go away from you."</p>
<p class="bas indent1"><span class="nm">(c)</span><span class="cl">(Rav Shmuel bar Nachmani):</span> Whoever does one Mitzvah in this world, it goes before him in the world to come - "your righteousness will go before you."</p>
<p class="bas indent2"><span class="nm">1.</span>Whoever does a sin in this world, it envelops him and goes before him in the world to come - "they are gripped in their ways, they achieve nothing and perish."</p>
<p class="bas indent2"><span class="nm">2.</span><span class="cl">(R. Elazar):</span> It clings to him like a dog - "he (Yosef) did not listen to her (Potifar's wife) to lie with her, to be with her";</p>
<p class="bas indent3"><span class="nm">i.</span>"To lie with her" - in this world. "To be with her" - in the world to come.</p>
<p class="bas subject"><span class="nm">4)</span>HOW MANY WITNESSES ARE REQUIRED?</p>
<p class="bas indent1"><span class="nm">(a)</span><span class="cl">(Mishnah) Suggestion:</span> If we require two witnesses for the first testimony (seclusion), which does not permanently forbid her, all the more so, the latter testimony (Tum'ah), which permanently forbids her, should require two witnesses!</p>
<p class="bas indent1"><span class="nm">(b)</span><span class="cl">Rejection:</span> "V'Ed Ein Bah" - any testimony (of Tum'ah) against her (permanently forbids her).</p>
<p class="bas indent1"><span class="nm">(c)</span><span class="cl">Suggestion:</span> The latter testimony, which permanently forbids her, needs only one witness. All the more one witness should suffice for the first testimony, which does not permanently forbid her!</p>
<p class="bas indent1"><span class="nm">(d)</span><span class="cl">Rejection:</span> It says regarding adultery "Ki Matza Vah Ervas Davar", and regarding monetary cases it says "According to two or three witnesses a Davar will be established";</p>
<p class="bas indent2"><span class="nm">1.</span>Just like two witnesses are needed there, also regarding seclusion.</p>
<p class="bas indent1"><span class="nm">(e)</span><span class="cl">Question:</span> We learn that seclusion needs two witnesses from elsewhere, "V'Ed Ein Bah"!</p>
<p class="bas indent2"><span class="nm">1.</span>One witness suffices "Bah" (for Tum'ah), but not for warning or seclusion!</p>
<p class="bas indent1"><span class="nm">(f)</span><span class="cl">Answer:</span> Indeed, this is what the Mishnah means!</p>
<p class="bas indent2"><span class="nm">1.</span>"V'Ed Ein Bah" - one witness suffices for Tum'ah, but not for warning or seclusion;</p>
<p class="bas indent2"><span class="nm">2.</span><span class="cl">Question:</span> What is the source to require two witnesses about adultery if there was no warning and seclusion?</p>
<p class="bas indent2"><span class="nm">3.</span><span class="cl">Answer:</span> It says "Ki Matza Vah Ervas Davar", and "According to two..."</p>
