<p class="bas subject"><span class="nm">1)</span>ANIMALS WORKING WITH <i>TERUMAH</i> AND <i>MA'ASER</i></p>
<p class="bas indent1"><span class="nm">(a)</span><span class="cl">(Beraisa #1):</span> If one muzzles a cow that is Meraches (threshes grain that was soaked and dried) or threshes Terumah or Ma'aser, he does not transgress "Lo Sachsom" (Rashi - these were already Kevu'im for Ma'aser. Tosfos - Terumah and Ma'aser are not "Disho", i.e. food fit for it. Rambam - Meraches is stepping on grain while walking on its way. This is not considered work);</p>
<p class="bas indent2"><span class="nm">1.</span>To avoid suspicion (others assume that it is regular Chulin), he brings a handful of the same species and hangs it near its mouth so it can eat.</p>
<p class="bas indent2"><span class="nm">2.</span>R. Shimon says, he gives it vetch (horsebean), for this is the best food for it.</p>
<p class="bas indent1"><span class="nm">(b)</span><span class="cl">Contradiction (Beraisa #2):</span> One who muzzles a cow that is Meraches does not transgress "Lo Sachsom." If it threshes Terumah or Ma'aser, he transgresses.</p>
<p class="bas indent2"><span class="nm">1.</span>If a Nochri threshes with Reuven's muzzled cow, Reuven does not transgress;</p>
<p class="bas indent2"><span class="nm">2.</span>If Reuven threshes with a muzzled cow of a Nochri, Reuven transgresses.</p>
<p class="bas indent2"><span class="nm">3.</span>The Beraisos argue about Terumah and Ma'aser!</p>
<p class="bas indent1"><span class="nm">(c)</span><span class="cl">Answer #1 (regarding Terumah):</span> He does not transgress if it threshes regular (mid'Oraisa) Terumah. He transgresses if it threshes Peros grown from Terumah seeds (which is only Terumah mid'Rabanan);</p>
<p class="bas indent1"><span class="nm">(d)</span><span class="cl">Question:</span> The contradiction remains regarding Ma'aser!</p>
<p class="bas indent1"><span class="nm">(e)</span><span class="cl">Suggestion:</span> Perhaps also regarding Ma'aser, he transgresses if it threshes Peros grown from Ma'aser.</p>
<p class="bas indent1"><span class="nm">(f)</span><span class="cl">Rejection:</span> Granted, Peros grown from Terumah are Terumah, but Peros grown from Ma'aser are Chulin!</p>
<p class="bas indent2"><span class="nm">1.</span><span class="cl">(Mishnah):</span> Peros grown from Tevel or Ma'aser Sheni are Chulin.</p>
<p class="bas indent1"><span class="nm">(g)</span><span class="cl">Answer #1 (regarding Ma'aser):</span> He transgresses if it threshes Ma'aser Rishon (it is like Chulin), but not if it threshes Ma'aser Sheni.</p>
<p class="bas indent1"><span class="nm">(h)</span><span class="cl">Answer #2 (regarding Ma'aser):</span> In both Beraisos, it threshes Ma'aser Sheni;</p>
<p class="bas indent2"><span class="nm">1.</span>Beraisa #1 is R. Meir, who says that Ma'aser Sheni is like Hekdesh. Beraisa #2 is R. Yehudah, who says that Ma'aser Sheni is like Chulin.</p>
<p class="bas indent2"><span class="nm">2.</span><span class="cl">Question:</span> In what case is it Ma'aser before threshing?</p>
<p class="bas indent2"><span class="nm">3.</span><span class="cl">Answer:</span> He declared it to be Ma'aser when it was still sheaves.</p>
<p class="bas indent2"><span class="nm">4.</span><span class="cl">Question:</span> According to R. Yehudah, why is he liable? He may not let the animal eat Ma'aser Sheni outside of Yerushalayim!</p>
<p class="bas indent2"><span class="nm">5.</span><span class="cl">Answer:</span> The case is, it threshes within Yerushalayim.</p>
<p class="bas indent1"><span class="nm">(i)</span><span class="cl">Answer #3 (regarding Ma'aser):</span> He is liable for Ma'aser Sheni of Demai (doubtfully tithed Peros. Mid'Oraisa, they are Chulin.) He is exempt for proper (mid'Oraisa) Ma'aser Sheni.</p>
<p class="bas indent2"><span class="nm">1.</span>This suggests another answer for Terumah!</p>
<p class="bas indent1"><span class="nm">(j)</span><span class="cl">Answer #2 (regarding Terumah):</span> He is liable for Terumah of Demai, and exempt for proper Terumah.</p>
<p class="bas indent1"><span class="nm">(k)</span><span class="cl">Question:</span> We find Ma'aser of Demai, but not Terumah of Demai!</p>
<p class="bas indent2"><span class="nm">1.</span><span class="cl">(Beraisa):</span> (Yochanan Kohen Gadol) instructed people not to say the declaration of Ma'aser (since it was enacted to give Ma'aser Rishon to Kohanim or the poor, people cannot say "Nesativ la'Levi"), and decreed that one who buys Peros from a commoner (i.e. one who did not accept all the stringencies of being trustworthy about Ma'aser) must separate Ma'asros;</p>
<p class="bas indent3"><span class="nm">i.</span>This is because he found that many people separated only Terumah Gedolah, but not Ma'asros.</p>
<p class="bas indent1"><span class="nm">(l)</span><span class="cl">Answer #3 (regarding Terumah):</span> He is liable for Terumas Ma'aser of Demai, and exempt for proper Terumas Ma'aser.</p>
<p class="bas indent1"><span class="nm">(m)</span><span class="cl">Question:</span> If an animal was suffering diarrhea from eating, may he muzzle it?</p>
<p class="bas indent2"><span class="nm">1.</span>If the Mitzvah is for the physical well-being of the animal, it is better that it not eat;</p>
<p class="bas indent2"><span class="nm">2.</span>If the Mitzvah is because the animal is pained when it sees food and cannot eat it, he should let it eat!</p>
<p class="bas indent1"><span class="nm">(n)</span><span class="cl">Answer (Rav Sheshes - Beraisa - R. Shimon):</span> He gives it vetch, for this is the best food for it.</p>
<p class="bas indent2"><span class="nm">1.</span>This shows that the Mitzvah is for the physical well-being of the animal.</p>
<p class="bas subject"><span class="nm">2)</span>ASKING A <i>NOCHRI</i> TO MUZZLE</p>
<p class="bas indent1"><span class="nm">(a)</span><span class="cl">Question:</span> May Reuven tell a Nochri 'muzzle my cow and thresh with it'?</p>
<p class="bas indent2"><span class="nm">1.</span>One may not tell a Nochri to do Melachah on Shabbos. Perhaps this is a stringency of Shabbos (since one who desecrates Shabbos is liable to death), but it does not apply to muzzling, which is only a Lav;</p>
<p class="bas indent2"><span class="nm">2.</span>Or, perhaps there is no distinction!</p>
<p class="bas indent1"><span class="nm">(b)</span><span class="cl">Answer #1 (Beraisa):</span> If a Nochri threshes with Reuven's muzzled cow, Reuven does not transgress.</p>
<p class="bas indent2"><span class="nm">1.</span><span class="cl">Inference:</span> He does not transgress, but it is forbidden!</p>
<p class="bas indent1"><span class="nm">(c)</span><span class="cl">Rejection:</span> Really, it is permitted. The Tana said 'he does not transgress' for parallel structure with the Seifa: if Reuven threshes with a muzzled cow of a Nochri, Reuven transgresses.</p>
<p class="bas indent1"><span class="nm">(d)</span><span class="cl">Answer #2 - Question (from Eretz Yisrael):</span> If Nochrim steal bulls from Yisre'elim (their friends, who prefer castrated bulls for plowing), castrate them and return them, what is the law?</p>
<p class="bas bbbline">90b----------------------------------------90b</p>
<p class="bas indent2"><span class="nm">1.</span><span class="cl">Answer (Shmuel's father):</span> This is a ruse. We do not let the owners benefit from this; they must sell them. (Even though castration is only a Lav, one may not ask a Nochri to do it.)</p>
<p class="bas indent1"><span class="nm">(e)</span><span class="cl">Rejection (Rav Papa):</span> In Eretz Yisrael, they hold like Rav Chidka, who holds that Nochrim are forbidden to castrate. If a Yisrael encourages them to do so, he transgresses "Lifnei Iver."</p>
<p class="bas indent1"><span class="nm">(f)</span><span class="cl">(Rava):</span> Shmuel's father ruled that the bulls must be sold for slaughter.</p>
<p class="bas indent1"><span class="nm">(g)</span><span class="cl">Rejection (Abaye):</span> It suffices that we fine the owner by forcing him to sell them.</p>
<p class="bas indent1"><span class="nm">(h)</span>Obviously, selling it to one's (adult) son is (permitted,) like selling it to a stranger.</p>
<p class="bas indent1"><span class="nm">(i)</span><span class="cl">Question:</span> May he sell it to his minor son?</p>
<p class="bas indent1"><span class="nm">(j)</span><span class="cl">Answer #1 (Rav Achi):</span> No.</p>
<p class="bas indent1"><span class="nm">(k)</span><span class="cl">Answer #2 (Rav Ashi):</span> Yes.</p>
<p class="bas indent1"><span class="nm">(l)</span>Mereimar and Mar Zutra would exchange their bulls with each other (Tosfos - they did not want the Nochrim to castrate them. In any case, they did not keep them, lest people will suspect them).</p>
<p class="bas subject"><span class="nm">3)</span>DIFFERENT KINDS OF MUZZLING</p>
<p class="bas indent1"><span class="nm">(a)</span><span class="cl">Question #1 (Rami bar Chama):</span> May one put a thorn in an animal's mouth so it cannot eat (while working)?</p>
<p class="bas indent1"><span class="nm">(b)</span><span class="cl">Objection:</span> Surely not. That is muzzling!</p>
<p class="bas indent1"><span class="nm">(c)</span><span class="cl">Correction - Question #1 (Rami bar Chama):</span> If an animal has a thorn in its mouth and cannot eat, must one remove it before working with it?</p>
<p class="bas indent1"><span class="nm">(d)</span><span class="cl">Question #2:</span> May one set a lion near the animal, so it will be afraid to eat?</p>
<p class="bas indent1"><span class="nm">(e)</span><span class="cl">Objection:</span> Surely not, that is muzzling!</p>
<p class="bas indent1"><span class="nm">(f)</span><span class="cl">Correction - Question #2:</span> If a lion was near the animal, may one work with it? (Tosfos - even if one must remove a thorn, this does not show that one may not work with an animal that  will not eat due to something not on the animal's body.)</p>
<p class="bas indent1"><span class="nm">(g)</span><span class="cl">Question #3:</span> May one set the animal's child nearby, so it will be reluctant to eat? (Some texts - if the animal's child is nearby, what is the law?)</p>
<p class="bas indent1"><span class="nm">(h)</span><span class="cl">Question #4:</span> May one put a hide over the grain, so the animal will not see what it threshes?</p>
<p class="bas indent1"><span class="nm">(i)</span><span class="cl">Answer (to Question #4 - Beraisa):</span> Reuven may deny food to his cow in order that it will eat a lot when working by Shimon. Reuven may put straw in front of his animal so it will not eat from what it threshes.</p>
<p class="bas indent1"><span class="nm">(j)</span><span class="cl">Rejection #1:</span> There, it eats (straw, at least). If he puts a skin over, it will not eat anything.</p>
<p class="bas indent1"><span class="nm">(k)</span><span class="cl">Rejection #2:</span> The Beraisa means that Reuven may put straw in front of his animal before it threshes, so it will not eat much when it threshes.</p>
<p class="bas indent1"><span class="nm">(l)</span><span class="cl">Question (R. Yonasan):</span> If Reuven muzzled his animal before it started threshing, what is the law?</p>
<p class="bas indent2"><span class="nm">1.</span>The Torah forbids muzzling when it threshes. He did not do this!</p>
<p class="bas indent2"><span class="nm">2.</span>Or, perhaps it is forbidden to thresh with a muzzled animal?</p>
<p class="bas indent1"><span class="nm">(m)</span><span class="cl">Answer (R. Simai):</span> (Kohanim may not drink wine) "b'Vo'achem." Does this forbid drinking only while in the Mikdash, but permit drinking beforehand?!</p>
<p class="bas indent2"><span class="nm">1.</span>It says "u'Lehavdil" (he must be sober to distinguish)!</p>
<p class="bas indent2"><span class="nm">2.</span>Rather, the verse teaches that at the time of coming, he may not be drunk;</p>
<p class="bas indent3"><span class="nm">i.</span>Likewise, at the time of threshing, the animal may not be muzzled!</p>
<p class="bas indent1"><span class="nm">(n)</span><span class="cl">(Beraisa):</span> If Reuven muzzled a cow or tied diverse species to a wagon and Shimon made them thresh or lead, Reuven is exempt and Shimon is liable.</p>
