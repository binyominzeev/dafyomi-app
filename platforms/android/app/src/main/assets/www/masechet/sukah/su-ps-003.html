<div class="subject"><span class="nm">1)</span><p>A SMALL SUKAH</p></div>
<div class="indent1"><span class="nm">(a)</span><p><span class="cl">(R. Shmuel b. Yitzchak):</span> A Sukah must be able to accommodate most of a person (his head and most of his body) and his table (7x7 Tefachim - 6 for his body and 1 for his table).</p></div>
<div class="indent1"><span class="nm">(b)</span><p><span class="cl">Question (R. Aba):</span> Is this in accordance with Beis Shamai?</p></div>
<div class="indent1"><span class="nm">(c)</span><p><span class="cl">Answer (R. Shmuel b. Yitzchak):</span> Who else?!</p></div>
<div class="indent1"><span class="nm">(d)</span><p>Alternately:</p></div>
<div class="indent2"><span class="nm">1.</span><p><span class="cl">Question (R. Aba):</span> Who taught you this?</p></div>
<div class="indent2"><span class="nm">2.</span><p><span class="cl">Answer (R. Shmuel b. Yitzchak):</span> Beis Shamai and it is the Halachah!</p></div>
<div class="indent1"><span class="nm">(e)</span><p><span class="cl">Question:</span> Maybe there is no Machlokes Beis Hillel and Beis Shamai over a small Sukah!?</p></div>
<div class="indent2"><span class="nm">1.</span><p>Perhaps Beis Hillel and Beis Shamai argue only where a Sukah is <i>large enough</i> for him and his table.</p></div>
<div class="indent2"><span class="nm">2.</span><p>When he, in that case, sits at the door and places his table inside the house, they may argue over whether we worry about him "following his table" into the house [Beis Shamai] or not [Beis Hillel].</p></div>
<div class="indent2"><span class="nm">3.</span><p>If, however, the Sukah were so small that only his body (and not his table) could fit in, then even Beis Hillel might agree that this is not considered a dwelling?</p></div>
<div class="indent2"><span class="nm">4.</span><p>This suggestion gains support from the Mishnah which speaks of one who has his table in the house, but does <i>not</i> discuss the (more basic) issue of one whose Sukah is too small for his table altogether (presumably because that would not be a Machlokes).</p></div>
<div class="indent1"><span class="nm">(f)</span><p><span class="cl">Answer:</span> We can demonstrate from the resolution of two Beraisos that they argue by such a small Sukah as well.</p></div>
<div class="indent2"><span class="nm">1.</span><p>The first Beraisa:</p></div>
<div class="indent3"><span class="nm">i.</span><p><span class="cl">(Tana Kama):</span> A Sukah needs only to be large enough to contain the majority of his body and his table.</p></div>
<div class="indent3"><span class="nm">ii.</span><p><span class="cl">(Rebbi):</span> It must be 4x4 Amos.</p></div>
<div class="indent2"><span class="nm">2.</span><p>The second Beraisa:</p></div>
<div class="indent3"><span class="nm">i.</span><p><span class="cl">(Rebbi):</span> It must be 4x4 Amos.</p></div>
<div class="indent3"><span class="nm">ii.</span><p><span class="cl">(Chachamim):</span> Even if it only can contain his head and the majority of his body.</p></div>
<div class="indent2"><span class="nm">3.</span><p>We see that the (second) Beraisa does not mention his table!</p></div>
<div class="indent2"><span class="nm">4.</span><p><span class="cl">Question:</span> But the Beraisos are contradictory!</p></div>
<div class="indent2"><span class="nm">5.</span><p><span class="cl">Answer:</span> We must conclude that the first Beraisa is Beis Shamai (body plus table) and the second is Beis Hillel (even body alone is sufficient), and they indeed argue even by a small Sukah.</p></div>
<div class="indent1"><span class="nm">(g)</span><p><span class="cl">(Mar Zutra):</span> The Mishnah (28b) also indicates this extension of the Machlokes since it uses the language of Kosher and Pasul which indicates that it is speaking about the <i>Sukah itself</i> being Kosher or Pasul (meaning its size), but not about his ability to fulfil the Mitzvah with it (for fear of being drawn into the house).</p></div>
<div class="indent1"><span class="nm">(h)</span><p><span class="cl">Question:</span> But the wording of the Mishnah is, "He who was in a Sukah [and his table was in the house]..." which implies that we are speaking of a sufficiently large Sukah!?</p></div>
<div class="indent1"><span class="nm">(i)</span><p><span class="cl">Answer:</span> They argue both by a large Sukah (if he is Yotzei if his table is in the house) and by a small Sukah (is it a Shiur)</p></div>
<div class="indent2"><span class="nm">1.</span><p>To fit this into the Mishnah we need to emend the text.</p></div>
<div class="indent2"><span class="nm">2.</span><p>It should read, 'If one were in and his table was out... it is a Machlokes; and if it were so small... it is also a Machlokes.'</p></div>
<div class="subject"><span class="nm">2)</span><p>A HOUSE OF LESS THAN FOUR AMOS</p></div>
<div class="indent1"><span class="nm">(a)</span><p><span class="cl">Question:</span> Are we to understand that this Beraisa (which lists 10 Halachos for which a house of less than 4x4 Amos is not qualified) is Rebbi and not the Rabanan?</p></div>
<div class="indent1"><span class="nm">(b)</span><p><span class="cl">Answer:</span> No, the Rabanan could agree that regarding permanent homes, four Amos is the minimum Shiur, without disqualifying a Sukah (Diras Ar'ai) which is smaller.</p></div>
<div class="indent1"><span class="nm">(c)</span><p>Five of the above disqualifications are clear since the word Bayis is used in reference to these Halachos.</p></div>
<div class="indent2"><span class="nm">1.</span><p>Bayis is written by Mezuzah, Ma'akeh, Tumas Nega'im, Chalatah of a house in a walled city, and by returning from the battlefront for a new house.</p></div>
<div class="indent2"><span class="nm">2.</span><p>We understand that a house of less than four Amos would not qualify as a Bayis.</p></div>
<div class="indent1"><span class="nm">(d)</span><p>Three of the above are clear since they require a place fit for dwelling.</p></div>
<div class="indent2"><span class="nm">1.</span><p>Participating in an Eiruv Chatzeiros, restricting the other B'nei ha'Chatzer, and storing the collected Eiruv Chatzeiros in the home.</p></div>
<div class="indent2"><span class="nm">2.</span><p>These require actual dwellings, not such a small house.</p></div>
<div class="indent2"><span class="nm">3.</span><p>We can infer that the Shituf Mevuos <i>could</i> be stored in that home.</p></div>
<div class="indent3"><span class="nm">i.</span><p>This is inferred from the restriction stated regarding storing the Eiruv Chatzeiros.</p></div>
<div class="indent3"><span class="nm">ii.</span><p>This is so since it is not worse than storing it in the Chatzer itself.</p></div>
<div class="indent2"><span class="nm">4.</span><p>The Mishnah permits this by teaching that the Eiruv Chatzeiros is stored in the Chatzer while the Shituf Mevuos is stored in the Mavoy.</p></div>
<div class="indent3"><span class="nm">i.</span><p><span class="cl">Question:</span> How can we say that we may store the Eiruv Chatzeiros in the Chatzer (presumably, anywhere in the Chatzer) given the Mishnah which says that it is invalid if left in any of the small structures in the Chatzer!?</p></div>
<div class="indent3"><span class="nm">ii.</span><p><span class="cl">Answer:</span> Rather, the Beraisa means by 'in the Chatzer' that it is stored in one of the <i>homes</i> of the Chatzer (as opposed to another Chatzer), while Shituf Mevuos may, as stated, be left in any protected place in the Mavoy.</p></div>
<div class="indent1"><span class="nm">(e)</span><p>The ninth disqualification (that it will not extend the boundary of one city towards the other) is clear.</p></div>
<div class="indent2"><span class="nm">1.</span><p>This is so because a house of less than 4x4 Amos is not even considered as legitimate a dwelling as a Burgenin.</p></div>
<div class="indent2"><span class="nm">2.</span><p>A Burgenin is, at least, fit for its defined function, unlike this small 'house.'</p></div>
<div class="indent1"><span class="nm">(f)</span><p>The tenth disqualification is that brothers and partners cannot divide it.</p></div>
<div class="indent2"><span class="nm">1.</span><p>We assume that this means that one cannot force the other to divide a house of less than 4x4 Amos.</p></div>
<div class="indent2"><span class="nm">2.</span><p>The inference is that anything larger <i>would</i> be subject to a forced division.</p></div>
<div class="indent2"><span class="nm">3.</span><p><span class="cl">Question:</span> The Mishnah has taught that a division may only be forced if <i>each</i> partner would end up with at least four Amos!?</p></div>
<div class="indent2"><span class="nm">4.</span><p><span class="cl">Answer:</span> We mean that a house of less than 4x4 Amos does not have the "Din Chalukah in a Chatzer."</p></div>
<div class="indent3"><span class="nm">i.</span><p>This "Din Chalukah in a Chatzer" is the method for dividing the Chatzer adjoining its houses after the partners have decided who will take each house.</p></div>
<div class="indent3"><span class="nm">ii.</span><p>R. Huna holds that it is divided and allocated according to the number of doorways which open into it.</p></div>
<div class="indent3"><span class="nm">iii.</span><p>R. Chisda holds that each door must be given four Amos (depth, by the width of the door) with the balance divided equally between the partners.</p></div>
<div class="indent3"><span class="nm">iv.</span><p>Both would agree, however, that a house of less than 4x4 Amos does not exact space allocation in the Chatzer (since this structure is likely to be taken down given its lack of utility).</p></div>
