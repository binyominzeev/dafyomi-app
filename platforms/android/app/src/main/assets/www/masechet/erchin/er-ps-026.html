<p class="bas subject"><span class="nm">1)</span>THE REASONING OF THE <i>TANA'IM</i></p>
<p class="bas indent1"><span class="nm">(a)</span><span class="cl">Question:</span> Why doesn't R. Yehudah learn from Shalmei Tzibur?</p>
<p class="bas indent1"><span class="nm">(b)</span><span class="cl">Answer:</span> It is better to learn Kodshei Bedek ha'Bayis from Bedek ha'Bayis, and not from Kodshei Mizbe'ach.</p>
<p class="bas indent1"><span class="nm">(c)</span><span class="cl">Question:</span> Why doesn't R. Shimon learn from a Kodesh house?</p>
<p class="bas indent1"><span class="nm">(d)</span><span class="cl">Answer:</span> It is better to learn a gift to Kohanim (the field) from a gift to Kohanim (Shalmei Tzibur). A house is not a gift to Kohanim.</p>
<p class="bas indent1"><span class="nm">(e)</span><span class="cl">(Mishnah - R. Elazar):</span> Kohanim neither receive it nor pay...</p>
<p class="bas indent1"><span class="nm">(f)</span><span class="cl">Question:</span> What is R. Elazar's reason?</p>
<p class="bas indent1"><span class="nm">(g)</span><span class="cl">Answer #1 (Rabah):</span> He expounds "v'Im Lo Yig'al Es ha'Sadeh... Lo Yiga'el Od," "v'Im Machar Es ha'Sadeh... v'Hayah ha'Sadeh b'Tzeiso va'Yovel."</p>
<p class="bas indent1"><span class="nm">(h)</span><span class="cl">Objection (Abaye):</span> It is unreasonable to cut up the verse like this! ("V'Im Machar Es ha'Sadeh" is in the middle of the verse, between "v'Im Lo Yig'al" and "Lo Yiga'el Od"!)</p>
<p class="bas indent1"><span class="nm">(i)</span><span class="cl">Answer #2 (Abaye):</span> He learns like the following:</p>
<p class="bas indent2"><span class="nm">1.</span><span class="cl">(Beraisa) Suggestion:</span> Perhaps "Lo Yiga'el" teaches that it cannot be redeemed at all, even like a Sedeh Miknah!</p>
<p class="bas indent2"><span class="nm">2.</span><span class="cl">Rejection:</span> It cannot be redeemed "Od" like it used to be (a Sedeh Achuzah), but it can be redeemed like a Sedeh Miknah.</p>
<p class="bas indent2"><span class="nm">3.</span><span class="cl">Question:</span> When does this apply?</p>
<p class="bas indent2"><span class="nm">4.</span><span class="cl">Answer #1:</span> It applies during the first Yovel.</p>
<p class="bas indent2"><span class="nm">5.</span><span class="cl">Rejection:</span> If so, it can be redeemed to be a Sedeh Achuzah again! (Rashi - this is if no one redeemed it yet. Rambam - it is even if someone else redeemed it.)</p>
<p class="bas indent2"><span class="nm">6.</span><span class="cl">Answer #2:</span> It applies during the second Yovel.</p>
<p class="bas indent3"><span class="nm">i.</span><span class="cl">Question:</span> Who is the Tana of the Beraisa?</p>
<p class="bas indent3"><span class="nm">ii.</span><span class="cl">Answer #1:</span> It is R. Yehudah or R. Shimon.</p>
<p class="bas indent3"><span class="nm">iii.</span><span class="cl">Rejection:</span> They say that an unredeemed field is given to Kohanim after the first Yovel!</p>
<p class="bas indent3"><span class="nm">iv.</span><span class="cl">Answer #2:</span> It is R. Elazar. This shows that he learns from "Lo Yiga'el Od."</p>
<p class="bas indent1"><span class="nm">(j)</span><span class="cl">Rejection:</span> It is unreasonable to explain this way. If so, how do R. Yehudah and R. Shimon expound "Od"?!</p>
<p class="bas indent2"><span class="nm">1.</span>Rather, the Beraisa refers to a field that a Kohen received it in Yovel, he was Makdish it, and the original owner wants to redeem it;</p>
<p class="bas indent2"><span class="nm">2.</span>One might have thought that he cannot redeem it, even to be like a Sedeh Miknah. The verse teaches that he cannot redeem it to be his Achuzah again, but he can redeem it like a Sedeh Miknah.</p>
<p class="bas indent2"><span class="nm">3.</span><span class="cl">Support (Beraisa) Suggestion:</span> Perhaps "bi'Shnas ha'Yovel Yashuv ha'Sadeh la'Asher Kanahu me'Ito" teaches that (if Reuven bought Shimon's field and was Makdish it, and Levi redeemed it, then in Yovel) it goes back to the Gizbar (Hekdesh), from whom Levi bought it!</p>
<p class="bas indent3"><span class="nm">i.</span><span class="cl">Rejection:</span> It says "la'Asher Lo Achuzas ha'Aretz." (It returns to Shimon). (We call this Case 1.)</p>
<p class="bas indent3"><span class="nm">ii.</span><span class="cl">Question:</span> Why do we need "la'Asher Kanahu me'Ito"?</p>
<p class="bas indent3"><span class="nm">iii.</span><span class="cl">Answer:</span> If Reuven bought a field from a Kohen who received it (in Yovel) and Reuven was Makdish it and Levi redeemed it, one might have thought it returns to the original owner in the next Yovel;</p>
<p class="bas indent3"><span class="nm">iv.</span>"La'Asher Kanahu me'Ito" teaches that rather, it returns to the Kohen (for it is now his Achuzah). (We call this Case 2.)</p>
<p class="bas indent1"><span class="nm">(k)</span>The Torah needed to write "Lo Yiga'el" and "la'Asher Kanahu me'Ito";</p>
<p class="bas indent2"><span class="nm">1.</span>Had it written only "Lo Yiga'el," one might have thought that in Case 1 it does not return to the original owner, for it does not return at all, but in Case 2, when it does return, it returns to the original owner;</p>
<p class="bas indent3"><span class="nm">i.</span>"La'Asher Kanahu me'Ito" teaches that it returns to the Kohen.</p>
<p class="bas indent2"><span class="nm">2.</span>Had it written only "la'Asher Kanahu me'Ito," one might have thought that in Case 2 it does not return to the original owner, for he did not pay anything, but in Case 1, when he pays to redeem it, it becomes his Achuzah again;</p>
<p class="bas indent3"><span class="nm">i.</span>"Lo Yiga'el" teaches that it does not return to him.</p>
<p class="bas indent2"><span class="nm">3.</span>Had it written only "Lo Yiga'el" and not "Od," one might have thought that he cannot redeem it at all. "Od" teaches that he cannot redeem it to be his Achuzah, but he can redeem it to be like a Sedeh Miknah.</p>
<p class="bas indent1"><span class="nm">(l)</span><span class="cl">Question:</span> We still do not have a (satisfactory) answer for Question (f)! (What is R. Elazar's source?)</p>
<p class="bas indent1"><span class="nm">(m)</span><span class="cl">Answer #3 (Rava):</span> "V'Hayah ha'Sadeh <i>b'Tzeiso</i> va'Yovel" refers to when it leaves someone else (who redeemed it. Then it is given to Kohanim, but not if it is still Hekdesh).</p>

<p class="bas indent1"><span class="nm">(a)</span><span class="cl">Question:</span> (According to R. Elazar, if the original owner redeemed his field) during Yovel Sheni is he like anyone else? (Does it revert to be his Achuzah?)</p>

<p class="bas indent2"><span class="nm">6.</span><span class="cl">Answer #3 (to Question 2):</span> (Really, it is like R. Yehudah and R. Shimon.) The Beraisa refers to a field that a Kohen received it in Yovel, he was Makdish it, and the original owner wants to redeem it;</p>
<p class="bas indent3"><span class="nm">i.</span>One might have thought that he cannot redeem it, even to be like a Sedeh Miknah. The verse teaches that he cannot redeem it to be his Achuzah again, but he can redeem it like a Sedeh Miknah.</p>

<p class="bas indent2"><span class="nm">1.</span>"La'Asher Kanahu me'Ito" teaches that it returns to the Kohen.</p>
<p class="bas indent1"><span class="nm">(g)</span>The Torah needed to write "Lo Yiga'el" and "la'Asher Kanahu me'Ito":</p>

<p class="bas indent1"><span class="nm">(h)</span><span class="cl">Question:</span> We still do not have an answer for Question (a)! (Is the original owner like anyone else during Yovel Sheni?)</p>
<p class="bas indent1"><span class="nm">(i)</span><span class="cl">Version #1 - Answer #2 (Beraisa - R. Elazar):</span> If the original owner redeemed it during Yovel Sheni, it is given to Kohanim in (the coming) Yovel.</p>
<p class="bas indent1"><span class="nm">(j)</span><span class="cl">Question (Ravina - Mishnah - R. Elazar):</span> It is not given to Kohanim until an Acher (someone else) redeems it.</p>
<p class="bas indent1"><span class="nm">(k)</span><span class="cl">Answer (Rav Ashi):</span> In Yovel Sheni, the original owner is like (and therefore called) an Acher.</p>
<p class="bas indent1"><span class="nm">(l)</span><span class="cl">Version #2 - Answer #2 (Beraisa - R. Elazar):</span> If the original redeemed it during Yovel Sheni, it is not given to Kohanim in Yovel.</p>

<p class="bas subject"><span class="nm">3)</span>ONE WHO INHERITS THE FIELD HE BOUGHT</p>
<p class="bas indent1"><span class="nm">(a)</span><span class="cl">(Mishnah - R. Meir):</span> If Reuven bought a field from his father Yakov, and was Makdish it after Yakov died, it is considered a Sedeh Achuzah;</p>
<p class="bas indent2"><span class="nm">1.</span>If he was Makdish it before Yakov died, it is considered a Sedeh Miknah;</p>
<p class="bas indent1"><span class="nm">(b)</span>R. Yehudah and R. Shimon say, also this is a Sedeh Achuzah;</p>
<p class="bas indent2"><span class="nm">1.</span>Regarding Sedeh Miknah, it says "Asher Lo mi'Sedeh Achuzaso", i.e. a field that could not have become his Achuzah. This field could have become his Achuzah. (Had he not bought it, he would have inherited it.)</p>
<p class="bas indent1"><span class="nm">(c)</span>(If one was Makdish) a Sedeh Miknah, it is not given to Kohanim in Yovel, for one (the buyer) cannot be Makdish something that he does not own (with permanent rights to the field).</p>
<p class="bas indent1"><span class="nm">(d)</span>Kohanim and Leviyim can be Makdish and redeem at any time, before or after Yovel.</p>
<p class="bas indent1"><span class="nm">(e)</span>(Gemara - Beraisa - R. Yehudah and R. Shimon) Question: If Reuven bought a field from his father Yakov, and was Makdish it; and Yakov died, what is the source that it is considered a Sedeh Achuzah?</p>
<p class="bas indent1"><span class="nm">(f)</span><span class="cl">Answer:</span> "Asher Lo mi'Sedeh Achuzaso" is a field that was not proper to be an Achuzah.</p>
<p class="bas indent1"><span class="nm">(g)</span>R. Meir says, if Reuven bought a field from his father Yakov, and Yakov died, and then Reuven was Makdish it, it is considered a Sedeh Achuzah;</p>
<p class="bas indent2"><span class="nm">1.</span>"Asher Lo mi'Sedeh Achuzaso" is a field that was not inherited when he was Makdish it, but he inherited (the right to permanently keep) this field. (end of Beraisa)</p>

<p class="bas indent1"><span class="nm">(i)</span><span class="cl">Answer #1:</span> They argue about whether Kinyan Peros (temporary ownership, i.e. the rights to the produce) is like Kinyan ha'Guf (permanent ownership);</p>
<p class="bas indent2"><span class="nm">1.</span>R. Meir holds that Kinyan Peros is like Kinyan ha'Guf (therefore, it is as if he did not inherit anything). R. Yehoshua and R. Shimon hold that Kinyan Peros is not like Kinyan ha'Guf. (Therefore, it is as if he inherited the field.)</p>
