<p class="bas subject"><span class="nm">1)</span><i>KILAYIM </i>(cont.)</p>
<p class="bas indent1"><span class="nm">(a)</span><span class="cl">Question:</span> Also regarding Kodshim it says "ox or lamb", which cannot produce Kilayim. We should say that 'or' comes to include Kilayim!</p>
<p class="bas indent1"><span class="nm">(b)</span><span class="cl">Answer:</span> Since the second 'or' in the verse comes to exclude, also the first 'or' excludes.</p>
<p class="bas indent1"><span class="nm">(c)</span><span class="cl">Question:</span> To the contrary! We should say that since the first 'or' comes to include, also the second 'or'!</p>
<p class="bas indent1"><span class="nm">(d)</span><span class="cl">Answer:</span> No. The way we learned is reasonable. After excluding Kilayim, we must also exclude Nidmeh;</p>
<p class="bas indent2"><span class="nm">1.</span>But if the first 'or' includes Kilayim, all the more so a Nidmeh is a valid Korban. We would not need another 'or'!</p>
<p class="bas indent1"><span class="nm">(e)</span><span class="cl">Question:</span> Rava taught that wherever the Torah says "Seh", this excludes Kilayim. To what does he refer?</p>
<p class="bas indent2"><span class="nm">1.</span>He cannot refer to Kodshim. "An ox or lamb" excludes Kilayim!</p>
<p class="bas indent2"><span class="nm">2.</span>He cannot refer to Ma'aser (of animals). We learn from a Gezeirah Shavah "Tachas-Tachas" from Kodshim!</p>
<p class="bas indent2"><span class="nm">3.</span>He cannot refer to a Bechor (firstborn male ox or Seh, which is automatically a Korban). We learn from a Gezeirah Shavah "Ha'avara-Ha'avara" from Ma'aser!</p>
<p class="bas indent3"><span class="nm">i.</span>Alternatively, we can learn from Nidmeh to Kilayim.</p>
<p class="bas indent3"><span class="nm">ii.</span>A firstborn Nidmeh is not Kodesh - "only the firstborn of an ox" - the ox and its firstborn must both look like oxen;</p>
<p class="bas indent3"><span class="nm">iii.</span>All the more so, a firstborn Kilayim is not Kodesh!</p>
<p class="bas indent1"><span class="nm">(f)</span><span class="cl">Answer:</span> Rabah taught about a Bechor donkey (one may redeem it with a Seh, even if the donkey is worth more than the Seh)..</p>
<p class="bas indent2"><span class="nm">1.</span><span class="cl">(Mishnah):</span> The following are not considered like a Seh to redeem a Bechor donkey: a calf; a Chayah (wild animal); a slaughtered Seh; a Tereifah; Kilayim; a Koy (a crossbreed of a deer and goat).</p>
<p class="bas indent1"><span class="nm">(g)</span><span class="cl">Question:</span> According to R. Elazar (who permits redeeming a Bechor with Kilayim), what does Rabah's rule teach?</p>
<p class="bas indent2"><span class="nm">1.</span><span class="cl">(Mishnah - R. Elazar):</span> One may redeem a Bechor donkey with Kilayim, because it is a Seh.</p>
<p class="bas indent1"><span class="nm">(h)</span><span class="cl">Answer:</span> Rabah's rule excludes a Tamei species born from a Tamei father and a Tahor mother.</p>
<p class="bas indent1"><span class="nm">(i)</span>Rabah's rule is not needed according to R. Yehoshua.</p>
<p class="bas indent2"><span class="nm">1.</span>R. Yehoshua learns from "Seh of sheep (plural)" and "Seh of goats" that the child is considered a Seh only if both parents are sheep (or both are goats).</p>
<p class="bas indent1"><span class="nm">(j)</span><span class="cl">Question:</span> Can a Tahor animal really become pregnant from a Tamei animal?</p>
<p class="bas bbbline">78b----------------------------------------78b</p>
<p class="bas indent1"><span class="nm">(k)</span><span class="cl">Answer:</span> It can become pregnant from a (Tahor) animal with uncloven hooves. This is like R. Shimon (who calls such an animal Tamei, and forbids eating it).</p>
<p class="bas subject"><span class="nm">2)</span>COMPENSATION FOR A STOLEN <i>KORBAN</i></p>
<p class="bas indent1"><span class="nm">(a)</span><span class="cl">Questions (Rava):</span> If Reuven accepted on himself to offer an Olah, and he separated an ox for this, and it was stolen, according to Chachamim, can the thief exempt himself by returning a lamb? According to R. Eliezer ben Azaryah, can the thief exempt himself by returning a bird?</p>
<p class="bas indent2"><span class="nm">1.</span><span class="cl">(Mishnah):</span> If one said 'I accept on myself to bring an Olah', he must bring a lamb (or another animal);</p>
<p class="bas indent2"><span class="nm">2.</span>R. Eliezer ben Azaryah says, he may bring a pigeon or dove.</p>
<p class="bas indent2"><span class="nm">3.</span><span class="cl">Summation of question:</span> Do we say that Reuven never specified what type of Olah he will bring, so the thief may return any valid species?</p>
<p class="bas indent3"><span class="nm">i.</span>Or, can Reuven say 'I intended to do an ideal Mitzvah (a big Korban, so you must return a big animal)'?</p>
<p class="bas indent1"><span class="nm">(b)</span><span class="cl">Answers (Rava):</span> The thief can exempt himself by returning a lamb (according to Chachamim) or a bird (according to R. Eliezer ben Azaryah).</p>
<p class="bas subject"><span class="nm">3)</span>A DEFECTIVE SALE OR SLAUGHTER</p>
<p class="bas indent1"><span class="nm">(a)</span><span class="cl">(Mishnah):</span> A thief pays Kefel, not four or five, in all the following cases: he sold the animal, except for one part in 100;</p>
<p class="bas indent2"><span class="nm">1.</span>He was a partner in it before stealing it;</p>
<p class="bas indent2"><span class="nm">2.</span>He slaughtered it improperly, making it Neveilah;</p>
<p class="bas indent2"><span class="nm">3.</span>He did Nechirah or Ikur (he tore or uprooted the foodpipe and windpipe).</p>
<p class="bas indent1"><span class="nm">(b)</span><span class="cl">(Gemara) Question:</span> What does 'except for one part in 100' mean?</p>
<p class="bas indent1"><span class="nm">(c)</span><span class="cl">Answer #1 (Rav):</span> He excluded (did not sell) something that is permitted through slaughter.</p>
<p class="bas indent1"><span class="nm">(d)</span><span class="cl">Answer #2 (Levi):</span> It is (even) if he excluded its shearings.</p>
<p class="bas indent1"><span class="nm">(e)</span><span class="cl">Support (Beraisa):</span> It is (even) if he excluded its shearings.</p>
<p class="bas indent1"><span class="nm">(f)</span><span class="cl">Question (Beraisa #1):</span> A thief does not pay four or five if he sold it except for its foreleg, hind leg, horn or shearings;</p>
<p class="bas indent2"><span class="nm">1.</span>Rebbi says, he pays four or five only if he sold everything necessary for slaughter (i.e. he did not retain anything whose removal would make the animal Neveilah);</p>
<p class="bas indent2"><span class="nm">2.</span>R. Shimon ben Elazar says, if he retained its horn, he does not pay four or five; if he retained the shearings, he pays four or five.</p>
<p class="bas indent2"><span class="nm">3.</span>Levi is like the first Tana, but Rav is not like any Tana!</p>
<p class="bas indent1"><span class="nm">(g)</span><span class="cl">Answer:</span> Rav holds like the following Tana.</p>
<p class="bas indent2"><span class="nm">1.</span><span class="cl">(Beraisa #2 - R. Shimon ben Elazar):</span> A thief does not pay four or five if he sold it except for its foreleg or hind leg. He does pay if he retained its horn or shearings.</p>
<p class="bas indent1"><span class="nm">(h)</span><span class="cl">Question:</span> What do the Tana'im argue about?</p>
<p class="bas indent1"><span class="nm">(i)</span><span class="cl">Answer:</span> The first Tana expounds "and he slaughtered it" - all of it; "or he sold it" - all of it;</p>
<p class="bas indent2"><span class="nm">1.</span>Rebbi expounds "and he slaughtered it" - whatever is necessary for slaughter. "Or he sold it" - this is like slaughter (he must sell whatever is necessary for slaughter);</p>
<p class="bas indent2"><span class="nm">2.</span>R. Shimon ben Elazar (Beraisa #1) holds that the horn is a remnant (rendering the sale incomplete, which exempts him), for it was not destined to be cut off from the animal;</p>
<p class="bas indent3"><span class="nm">i.</span>The shearings are not remnants, for they were destined to be cut off (so it is as if he sold the entire animal).</p>
<p class="bas indent2"><span class="nm">3.</span>R. Shimon ben Elazar (in Beraisa #2) holds that the legs are remnants, because they are permitted only through slaughter. The horns and shearings are not remnants, because they are permitted without slaughter.</p>
<p class="bas indent1"><span class="nm">(j)</span><span class="cl">Question:</span> R. Shimon ben Elazar contradicts himself!</p>
<p class="bas indent1"><span class="nm">(k)</span><span class="cl">Answer:</span> The Tana'im (of the two Beraisos) argue about what R. Shimon ben Elazar held.</p>
<p class="bas subject"><span class="nm">4)</span>STEALING A DEFECTIVE ANIMAL</p>
<p class="bas indent1"><span class="nm">(a)</span><span class="cl">(Beraisa):</span> A thief is liable for all the following animals: it is missing a limb, or lame, or blind, or it is of partners;</p>
<p class="bas indent1"><span class="nm">(b)</span>Partners who stole are exempt.</p>
<p class="bas indent1"><span class="nm">(c)</span><span class="cl">Contradiction (Beraisa):</span> Partners who stole are liable!</p>
<p class="bas indent1"><span class="nm">(d)</span><span class="cl">Answer #1 (Rav Nachman):</span> A man who stole from his partner is exempt. A partner who stole from someone else is liable.</p>
<p class="bas indent1"><span class="nm">(e)</span><span class="cl">Question (Rava - Beraisa) Suggestion:</span> Perhaps one who stole from his partner, or partners who stole are liable!</p>
<p class="bas indent2"><span class="nm">1.</span><span class="cl">Rejection:</span> "And he slaughtered it" - he is liable only if he slaughtered an entirely stolen animal.</p>
<p class="bas indent1"><span class="nm">(f)</span><span class="cl">Answer #2 (Rav Nachman):</span> Rather, if two partners stole, and one of them slaughtered, if the other authorized him to slaughter, both are liable. If not, they are exempt.</p>
<p class="bas indent1"><span class="nm">(g)</span><span class="cl">Questions (R. Yirmiyah):</span> What is the law in the following cases?</p>
<p class="bas indent2"><span class="nm">1.</span>He sold the animal except for 30 days (during which the thief may work with it);</p>
<p class="bas indent2"><span class="nm">2.</span>He retained the right to collect any work done with it (but the buyer may slaughter it whenever he wants);</p>
<p class="bas indent2"><span class="nm">3.</span>He retained its fetus.</p>
<p class="bas indent2"><span class="nm">4.</span>This last question is not according to the opinion that a fetus is like a limb of its mother. He surely exempts the thief, as if he retained a limb of the mother. The question is according to the opinion that a fetus is not like a limb of its mother:</p>
<p class="bas indent2"><span class="nm">5.</span><span class="cl">Version #1:</span> Do we say, since it is connected to the mother, it is a remnant (rendering the sale incomplete);</p>
<p class="bas indent3"><span class="nm">i.</span>Or, since it is destined to separate from the mother, it is not a remnant?</p>
<p class="bas indent2"><span class="nm">6.</span><span class="cl">Version #2:</span> Do we say, since it is not like a limb of its mother, therefore, it is not a remnant?</p>
<p class="bas indent3"><span class="nm">i.</span>Or - do we say, since it needs to become permitted through slaughter of the mother, it is a part of the mother (and is a remnant)? (end of Version #2)</p>
<p class="bas indent1"><span class="nm">(h)</span>These questions are unsettled.</p>
<p class="bas indent1"><span class="nm">(i)</span><span class="cl">Question (Rav Papa):</span> If a thief stole an animal, cut off a limb and sold the (rest of the) animal, what is the law?</p>
<p class="bas indent2"><span class="nm">1.</span>Do we say, since he did not sell the entire animal he stole, he is exempt (from four or five)?</p>
<p class="bas indent2"><span class="nm">2.</span>Or, since he did not retain anything for himself in what he sells, he is liable?</p>
<p class="bas indent1"><span class="nm">(j)</span>This question is unsettled.</p>
