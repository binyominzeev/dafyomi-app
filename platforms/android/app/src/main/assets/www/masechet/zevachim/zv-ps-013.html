<div class="indent1"><span class="nm">(a)</span><p><span class="cl">(Mishnah):</span> In the following cases, a Pesach or Chatas is Pasul:</p></div>
<div class="indent2"><span class="nm">1.</span><p>The Shechitah, Kabalah, Holachah or Zerikah was Lo Lishmah;</p></div>
<div class="indent2"><span class="nm">2.</span><p>Or, one of these Avodos was started Lishmah and finished Lo Lishmah, or vice-versa.</p></div>
<div class="indent1"><span class="nm">(b)</span><p>The case of Lishmah and then Lo Lishmah is when he started l'Shem Pesach, and ended l'Shem Shelamim;</p></div>
<div class="indent1"><span class="nm">(c)</span><p>Lo Lishmah and then Lishmah is when he started l'Shem Shelamim, and ended l'Shem Pesach.</p></div>
<div class="indent1"><span class="nm">(d)</span><p>Any of these four Avodos can disqualify a Korban (i.e. if it was done with improper intent);</p></div>
<div class="indent1"><span class="nm">(e)</span><p>R. Shimon says, Holachah cannot disqualify, for it is not always necessary (e.g. if the Shechitah was next to the Mizbeach);</p></div>
<div class="indent2"><span class="nm">1.</span><p>The other three Avodos are always necessary, so they can disqualify a Korban.</p></div>
<div class="indent1"><span class="nm">(f)</span><p>R. Elazar says, Holachah where it is necessary can disqualify a Korban. Holachah where it is unnecessary cannot.</p></div>
<div class="indent1"><span class="nm">(g)</span><p><span class="cl">(Gemara) Question:</span> Kabalah cannot disqualify!</p></div>
<div class="indent2"><span class="nm">1.</span><p><span class="cl">(Beraisa):</span> "V'Hikrivu" is Kabalah.</p></div>
<div class="indent2"><span class="nm">2.</span><p><span class="cl">Suggestion:</span> Perhaps it is Zerikah!</p></div>
<div class="indent2"><span class="nm">3.</span><p><span class="cl">Rejection:</span> "V'Zarku" teaches Zerikah, therefore "v'Hikrivu" is Kabalah.</p></div>
<div class="indent2"><span class="nm">4.</span><p>"Bnei Aharon ha'Kohanim" - a Kosher Kohen must do Kabalah, while wearing Bigdei Kehunah;</p></div>
<div class="indent2"><span class="nm">5.</span><p>R. Akiva says, we learn this because it says here "Bnei Aharon ha'Kohanim", just like it says "Bnei Aharon ha'Kohanim ha'Meshuchim Asher Milei Yadam Lechahen."</p></div>
<div class="indent3"><span class="nm">i.</span><p>Just like there they were Kosher Kohanim wearing Bigdei Kehunah, also here.</p></div>
<div class="indent2"><span class="nm">6.</span><p><span class="cl">R. Tarfon:</span> I heard a distinction between Kabalah and Zerikah. I cannot explain it.</p></div>
<div class="indent2"><span class="nm">7.</span><p><span class="cl">R. Akiva:</span> Regarding Kabalah, (improper) intent is not like an action (it does not disqualify). Regarding Zerikah, (improper) intent is like an action (it disqualifies);</p></div>
<div class="indent3"><span class="nm">i.</span><p>Also, if a Korban was slaughtered outside the Mikdash, one who did Kabalah is exempt, but one who does Zerikah (outside the Mikdash) is Chayav Kares.</p></div>
<div class="indent3"><span class="nm">ii.</span><p>If Pesulim (Zarim or Kohanim who may not serve) did Kabalah, they are not Chayav (Misah). If they did Zerikah, they are Chayav (Misah).</p></div>

<div class="indent1"><span class="nm">(h)</span><p><span class="cl">Answer #1 (Rava):</span> Intent that makes Pigul (Chutz li'Zmano) does not apply to Kabalah. Lo Lishmah applies to Kabalah.</p></div>

<div class="indent2"><span class="nm">1.</span><p><span class="cl">(Beraisa) Suggestion:</span> Perhaps improper intent applies only to Zerikah!</p></div>

<div class="indent3"><span class="nm">ii.</span><p>Zerikah is essential for Kaparah. (Improper intent during) it disqualifies a Korban. Also every Avodah essential for Kaparah disqualifies a Korban;</p></div>

<div class="indent1"><span class="nm">(k)</span><p><span class="cl">Answer #2:</span> Rather, if he said 'I slaughter with the intent to do Kabalah tomorrow', the Korban is Kosher;</p></div>
<div class="indent2"><span class="nm">1.</span><p>If he said 'I do Kabalah with intent to pour the leftover blood tomorrow', it is Pigul.</p></div>

<div class="indent2"><span class="nm">2.</span><p><span class="cl">Rejection:</span> "V'Im He'achel Ye'achel" teaches about two kinds of eating, of people and of the Mizbeach;</p></div>

<div class="indent1"><span class="nm">(a)</span><p><span class="cl">(Rav Yehudah brei d'R. Chiya):</span> Dipping the finger in the blood of inner Chata'os (in order to do Zerikah) is Mefagel (if done with intent Chutz li'Zmano.</p></div>
<div class="indent1"><span class="nm">(b)</span><p><span class="cl">Question (Ilfa):</span> We learn Pigul (in Chatas) from Shelamim,</p></div>
<div class="indent2"><span class="nm">1.</span><p>Dipping the finger is not Mefagel Shelamim (since it does not apply), therefore it does not Mefagel Chatas!</p></div>
<div class="indent2"><span class="nm">2.</span><p><span class="cl">Counter-question:</span> Do we really learn Pigul from Shelamim?!</p></div>
<div class="indent3"><span class="nm">i.</span><p>(Pigul applies only if the <i>only</i> Pesul was Chutz li'Zmano.) Lo Lishmah does not disqualify Shelamim, therefore it does not prevent a Shelamim (offered with an intent Chutz li'Zmano) from becoming Pigul;</p></div>
<div class="indent3"><span class="nm">ii.</span><p>If we learn Pigul only from Shelamim, there is no source to say that Lo Lishmah prevents a Chatas from becoming Pigul! (However, Mishnayos teach this law.)</p></div>
<div class="indent2"><span class="nm">3.</span><p><span class="cl">Answer:</span> You must say that a verse teaches that Pigul applies to other Korbanos.</p></div>
<div class="indent1"><span class="nm">(c)</span><p><span class="cl">Answer:</span> The verse that teaches about other Korbanos teaches that dipping the finger is Mefagel Chatas.</p></div>
<div class="indent1"><span class="nm">(d)</span><p><span class="cl">(R. Yehoshua ben Levi):</span> Dipping the finger is Mefagel.</p></div>
<div class="indent1"><span class="nm">(e)</span><p><span class="cl">Question (Reish Lakish):</span> We learn Pigul (in Chatas) from Shelamim. Dipping the finger does not Mefagel Shelamim, therefore it does not Mefagel Chatas!</p></div>
<div class="indent2"><span class="nm">1.</span><p><span class="cl">Counter-question:</span> Do we really learn Pigul from Shelamim?!</p></div>
<div class="indent3"><span class="nm">i.</span><p>Lo Lishmah does not disqualify Shelamim, therefore it does not prevent a Shelamim from becoming Pigul. We cannot learn from Shelamim that Lo Lishmah prevents a Chatas from becoming Pigul!</p></div>
<div class="indent2"><span class="nm">2.</span><p><span class="cl">Answer (R. Yosi b'Rebbi Chanina):</span> Indeed, we learn from Shelamim!</p></div>
<div class="indent3"><span class="nm">i.</span><p>Lo Lishmah disqualifies a Chatas just like intent Chutz li'Mkomo disqualifies a Shelamim;</p></div>
<div class="indent3"><span class="nm">ii.</span><p>Just like Chutz li'Mkomo prevents a Shelamim from becoming Pigul, Lo Lishmah prevents a Chatas from becoming Pigul!</p></div>
<div class="indent2"><span class="nm">3.</span><p><span class="cl">Rejection (R. Yirmeyah):</span> Chutz li'Mkomo disqualifies all Korbanos. We cannot learn to Lo Lishmah, which disqualifies only Chatas and Pesach!</p></div>
<div class="indent1"><span class="nm">(f)</span><p><span class="cl">Answer (R. Yirmeyah):</span> Rather, we can learn as follows. Regarding Shelamim, anything that disqualifies (e.g. intent Chutz li'Mkomo) prevents from becoming Pigul, and (intent Chutz li'Zmano in) any essential Avodah can make Pigul. We learn to Chatas that Lo Lishmah prevents from becoming Pigul, and dipping the finger (which is essential) can make Pigul!</p></div>
<div class="indent1"><span class="nm">(g)</span><p><span class="cl">Support (for R. Yehoshua ben Levi - Rav Mari - Mishnah):</span> Pigul applies to four Avodos in a Minchah - Kemitzah, putting the Kometz in a Keli, Holachah and Haktarah (burning the Kometz on the Mizbeach).</p></div>
<div class="indent2"><span class="nm">1.</span><p>We understand how three of these are learned from Shelamim. Kemitzah is like Shechitah (it separates the part that will be offered to Hash-m), Holachah corresponds to Holachah, and Haktarah is like Zerikah;</p></div>
<div class="indent2"><span class="nm">2.</span><p><span class="cl">Question:</span> What is the source for putting the Kometz in a Keli?</p></div>
<div class="indent3"><span class="nm">i.</span><p><span class="cl">Suggestion:</span> Perhaps this is like Kabalah.</p></div>
<div class="indent3"><span class="nm">ii.</span><p><span class="cl">Rejection:</span> Blood falls into the Keli by itself, but the Kohen must put the Kometz into a Keli!</p></div>
<div class="indent2"><span class="nm">3.</span><p><span class="cl">Answer #1:</span> Since it is an essential Avodah, it is important, so Pigul applies;</p></div>
<div class="indent3"><span class="nm">i.</span><p>Likewise, dipping the finger is essential, so Pigul applies! (It is like Holachah, for it brings the blood close to the Mizbeach.)</p></div>
<div class="indent1"><span class="nm">(h)</span><p><span class="cl">Rejection (and Answer #2 to Question g:2):</span> Really, it is like Kabalah;</p></div>
<div class="indent2"><span class="nm">1.</span><p>Since both consist of putting in a Keli, they are similar, even though one is by itself and the other is not.</p></div>
