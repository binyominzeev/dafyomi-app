<p class="dedicationbox">AVODAH ZARAH 4 - Two weeks of study material have been dedicated by Mrs. Estanne Abraham Fawer to honor the Yahrzeit of her father, Rav Mordechai ben Eliezer Zvi (Rabbi Morton Weiner) Z'L, who passed away on 18 Teves 5760. May the merit of supporting and advancing Dafyomi study -- which was so important to him -- during the weeks of his Yahrzeit serve as an Iluy for his Neshamah. </p>

<p class="bas indent1"><span class="nm">(a)</span><span class="cl">(Reish Lakish):</span> The wicked are judged through the sun - "Hinei ha'Yom Ba Bo'er ka'Tanur... v'Chol Ose Rish'a Kash... Lo Ya'azov Lahem Shoresh v'Anaf";</p>
<p class="bas indent2"><span class="nm">1.</span>They will not have a root in this world, nor a branch in the world to come.</p>
<p class="bas indent1"><span class="nm">(b)</span>Tzadikim are cured through it - "Shemesh Tzedakah u'Marpei bi'Chnafeha";</p>
<p class="bas indent2"><span class="nm">1.</span>Further, they will delight in it - "u'Pishtem k'Eglei Marbek."</p>
<p class="bas indent1"><span class="nm">(c)</span><span class="cl">Answer #3 (to Question 4:d, 3b):</span> Just like bigger fish swallow smaller fish, also bigger people would swallow smaller people, if not that they fear the king.</p>
<p class="bas indent2"><span class="nm">1.</span><span class="cl">(Mishnah - R. Chanina Segan ha'Kohanim):</span> Pray for the well-being of the kingdom. If people would not fear it, they would swallow each other alive.</p>
<p class="bas indent1"><span class="nm">(d)</span><span class="cl">Question (R. Chinena bar Papa):</span> It says "Shakai Lo Metzanuhu Sagi Cho'ach"; and it says "Gadol Adoneinu v'Rav Ko'ach" and "Yeminecha Hash-m Nedari ba'Ko'ach"!</p>
<p class="bas indent1"><span class="nm">(e)</span><span class="cl">Answer:</span> Hash-m does not act with strength when He judges (i.e. He does not decree destruction). He acts with strength in war.</p>
<p class="bas indent1"><span class="nm">(f)</span><span class="cl">Question (R. Chama b'Rebbi Chanina):</span> It says "Chemah Ein Li", and it says "Nokem Hash-m u'Va'al Chemah"!</p>
<p class="bas indent1"><span class="nm">(g)</span><span class="cl">Answer #1 (R. Chama):</span> He lacks anger against Yisrael. He has anger against Nochrim.</p>
<p class="bas indent2"><span class="nm">1.</span><span class="cl">Version #1 -Tosfos - (R. Chinena bar Papa):</span> Hash-m swore not to use Chemah against Yisrael, and regrets this.</p>
<p class="bas indent1"><span class="nm">(h)</span><span class="cl">Version #2 -Rashi - Answer #2 (R. Chinena bar Papa):</span> It all refers to Yisrael. Hash-m has Chemah, but he swore not to use it, and regrets this.</p>
<p class="bas subject"><span class="nm">2)</span>THE DIFFERENCE BETWEEN YISRAEL AND THE NOCHRIM</p>
<p class="bas indent1"><span class="nm">(a)</span><span class="cl">Question (R. Alexandri):</span> "Avakesh Lehashmid Es Kol ha'Goyim" - from whom will Hash-m request?</p>
<p class="bas indent1"><span class="nm">(b)</span><span class="cl">Answer:</span> Hash-m will examine the records of their deeds. If they have enough merits, He will redeem them. If not, He will destroy them.</p>
<p class="bas indent1"><span class="nm">(c)</span><span class="cl">Question (Rava):</span> What does it mean "Ach Lo B'i Yishlach Yad Im b'Fido Lahen Shu'a"?</p>
<p class="bas indent1"><span class="nm">(d)</span><span class="cl">Answer #1 (Rava):</span> Hash-m does not judge Yisrael like the Nochrim;</p>
<p class="bas indent2"><span class="nm">1.</span><span class="cl">Version #1 (Rashi):</span> Regarding Nochrim, "Avah Avah Avah Asimenah" (He repays them at once for all their sins)";</p>
<p class="bas indent3"><span class="nm">i.</span>Regarding Yisrael, Hash-m punishes b'Fido, bit by bit, like a pecking chicken.</p>
<p class="bas indent2"><span class="nm">2.</span><span class="cl">Version #2 (Maharsha):</span> Regarding Yisrael, "Avah Avah Avah Asimenah" - He punishes for each sin immediately, b'Fido, bit by bit, like a pecking chicken. (He does not allow their liability to grow great, as he does regarding Nochrim.) (end of Version #2)</p>
<p class="bas indent1"><span class="nm">(e)</span><span class="cl">Answer #2:</span> Even if Yisrael have merits as little as pecks of a chicken, Hash-m joins them and turns (Shu'a) to save them.</p>
<p class="bas indent1"><span class="nm">(f)</span><span class="cl">Answer #3:</span> In the merit that Yisrael MeSHAvim (pray) to Hash-m, He is MoSHi'A (saves) them.</p>
<p class="bas indent2"><span class="nm">1.</span><span class="cl">(R. Aba):</span> "V'Anochi Efdem v'Hemah Dib'ru Alai Kezavim" - Hash-m wanted to redeem Yisrael through monetary afflictions in this world in order that they will receive the world to come, but they denied this.</p>
<p class="bas indent2"><span class="nm">2.</span><span class="cl">Question (Rav Papi):</span> What does it mean "Yisarti Chizakti Zero'osam v'Elai Yichashevu Ra" - Hash-m intended to afflict Yisrael in this world in order to strengthen them in the world to come, but they thought Hash-m was doing evil to them.</p>
<p class="bas indent1"><span class="nm">(g)</span>R. Avahu told the Minim that Rav Safra was a great man; they exempted him from taxes for 13 years.</p>
<p class="bas indent2"><span class="nm">1.</span>Once, they asked Rav Safra 'why does it sayRak Eschem Yadati... Al Ken Efkod Aleichem Es Kol Avonoseichem"? One does not afflict his beloved! He did not answer. They started hurting him.</p>
<p class="bas indent2"><span class="nm">2.</span><span class="cl">R. Avahu:</span> Why are you hurting him?</p>
<p class="bas indent2"><span class="nm">3.</span><span class="cl">Minim:</span> You said that he is a great man, but he could not explain the verse!</p>
<p class="bas indent2"><span class="nm">4.</span><span class="cl">R. Avahu:</span> He is great in the oral Torah. He does not have people like you asking questions about written Torah. He has not delved as deeply into it as we (from whom you normally ask) have.</p>
<p class="bas indent2"><span class="nm">5.</span><span class="cl">Minim:</span> How do you answer?</p>
<p class="bas indent2"><span class="nm">6.</span><span class="cl">R. Avahu:</span> I explain through a parable. A man lent to someone he loves and to someone he hates;</p>
<p class="bas indent3"><span class="nm">i.</span>He collects from his friend bit by bit. He collects from the other all at once.</p>
<p class="bas indent1"><span class="nm">(h)</span><span class="cl">Question (R. Aba bar Kahana):</span> What is the meaning of "Chalilah Lecha... Lehamis Tzadik Im Rasha"?</p>
<p class="bas indent1"><span class="nm">(i)</span><span class="cl">Answer:</span> It is Chulin (profane) for You to kill Tzadikim along with Resha'im.</p>
<p class="bas indent1"><span class="nm">(j)</span><span class="cl">Question:</span> It says "v'Hichrati Mimech Tzadik v'Rasha"!</p>
<p class="bas indent1"><span class="nm">(k)</span><span class="cl">Answer:</span> That refers to one who is not a total Tzadik.</p>
<p class="bas indent1"><span class="nm">(l)</span><span class="cl">Question:</span> Is it really true that a total Tzadik will not be punished with Resha'im?</p>
<p class="bas indent2"><span class="nm">1.</span><span class="cl">(Rav Yosef):</span> "Umi'Mikdashi Tachlu (You will start killing in My Mikdash)" - read this 'mi'Mekudoshai (my holy ones)', people who kept the entire Torah.</p>
<p class="bas indent1"><span class="nm">(m)</span><span class="cl">Answer:</span> They were not total Tzadikim, for they should have protested against the sinners.</p>
<p class="bas subject"><span class="nm">3)</span>HASH-M'S FURY</p>
<p class="bas indent1"><span class="nm">(a)</span><span class="cl">Question (Rav Papa):</span> It says "v'Kel Zo'em b'Chol Yom", and it says "Lifnei Zam'o Mi Ya'amod"! (How do people survive?)</p>
<p class="bas indent1"><span class="nm">(b)</span><span class="cl">Answer:</span> If Hash-m would direct His fury at an individual, he could not survive. He directs it at the congregation. The congregation can survive it.</p>
<p class="bas indent1"><span class="nm">(c)</span><span class="cl">(Beraisa):</span> "V'Kel Zo'em b'Chol Yom" - his fury is for a Rega (moment). This is one part in 53, 848 of an hour (about one part in 15 of a second);</p>
<p class="bas indent2"><span class="nm">1.</span>The only creature that knew when this moment comes was Bilam, about whom it says "v'Yode'a Da'as Elyon."</p>
<p class="bas bbbline">4b----------------------------------------4b</p>
<p class="bas indent2"><span class="nm">2.</span><span class="cl">Question:</span> He did not even know his donkey's mind. How could he know Hash-m's?!</p>
<p class="bas indent3"><span class="nm">i.</span>When the Moabite nobles asked why he was riding on a donkey and not a horse, Bilam said that he left his horse grazing.</p>
<p class="bas indent3"><span class="nm">ii.</span><span class="cl">His donkey:</span> "Ha'Lo Anochi Asonecha."</p>
<p class="bas indent3"><span class="nm">iii.</span><span class="cl">Bilam:</span> You are for carrying burdens.</p>
<p class="bas indent3"><span class="nm">iv.</span><span class="cl">His donkey:</span> "Asher Rachavta Alai."</p>
<p class="bas indent3"><span class="nm">v.</span><span class="cl">Bilam:</span> I ride on you only occasionally.</p>
<p class="bas indent3"><span class="nm">vi.</span><span class="cl">His donkey:</span> "Me'Odecha Ad ha'Yom ha'Zeh!" You ride on me by day, and sleep with me at night - "ha'Hasken Hiskanti" (a virgin was picked to be a SoCHENes to David, to warm him).</p>
<p class="bas indent2"><span class="nm">3.</span><span class="cl">Answer:</span> Rather, "v'Yode'a Da'as Elyon" means that Bilam knew when is the moment of Hash-m's fury.</p>
<p class="bas indent1"><span class="nm">(d)</span><span class="cl">(R. Elazar):</span> "Ami Zechor... u'Meh Anah Oso Bilam... Lema'an Da'as Tzidkos Hash-m" - we should know what Hash-m did for us. He was not angry for a moment the entire time Bilam was trying to curse Yisrael;</p>
<p class="bas indent2"><span class="nm">1.</span>Had He been angry, (Bilam would have succeeded to curse, and) there would be no remnant of us.</p>
<p class="bas indent1"><span class="nm">(e)</span>This explains "Mah Ekov Lo Kaboh Kel u'Mah Ez'om Lo Za'am Hash-m."</p>
<p class="bas indent1"><span class="nm">(f)</span><span class="cl">Question:</span> What is the source that Hash-m's fury is a Rega?</p>
<p class="bas indent1"><span class="nm">(g)</span><span class="cl">Answer #1:</span> We learn from "Ki Rega b'Apo."</p>
<p class="bas indent1"><span class="nm">(h)</span><span class="cl">Answer #2:</span> We learn from "Chavi Chim'at Rega Ad Ya'avor Za'am."</p>
<p class="bas indent1"><span class="nm">(i)</span><span class="cl">Question:</span> When does this Rega come?</p>
<p class="bas indent1"><span class="nm">(j)</span><span class="cl">Answer (Abaye):</span> It is in the first three hours of the day, when a rooster's mane turns white.</p>
<p class="bas indent1"><span class="nm">(k)</span><span class="cl">Question:</span> Its mane is always white!</p>
<p class="bas indent1"><span class="nm">(l)</span><span class="cl">Answer:</span> All other times, it has red speckles. During the Rega, it is totally white.</p>
<p class="bas indent1"><span class="nm">(m)</span>A certain Min was bothering R. Yehoshua ben Levi with (perverted explanations of) verses. R. Yehoshua ben Levi set a rooster between the legs of his bed, intending to curse him when the mane turned all white.</p>
<p class="bas indent2"><span class="nm">1.</span>At the time, R. Yehoshua ben Levi fell asleep. He realized that Hash-m did not want him to curse him - "v'Rachamav Al Kol Ma'asav";</p>
<p class="bas indent2"><span class="nm">2.</span>Also, "Gam Anosh la'Tzadik Lo Tov."</p>
<p class="bas subject"><span class="nm">4)</span>PRAYING AT THE TIME OF JUDGMENT</p>
<p class="bas indent1"><span class="nm">(a)</span><span class="cl">(Beraisa - R. Meir):</span> When kings put on their crowns and bow to the sun, immediately Hash-m gets angry.</p>
<p class="bas indent1"><span class="nm">(b)</span><span class="cl">(Rav Yosef):</span> An individual should not pray Musaf during the first three hours of the day on Rosh Hashanah. Since Hash-m judges then, perhaps He will scrutinize his deeds, and his prayer will be rejected.</p>
<p class="bas indent1"><span class="nm">(c)</span><span class="cl">Question:</span> If so, also the congregation should not pray then!</p>
<p class="bas indent1"><span class="nm">(d)</span><span class="cl">Answer:</span> Since the congregation has many merits, its prayer is heard.</p>
<p class="bas indent1"><span class="nm">(e)</span><span class="cl">Question:</span> Likewise, an individual should not pray Shachris at this time!</p>
<p class="bas indent1"><span class="nm">(f)</span><span class="cl">Answer:</span> Since the congregation prays at this time, his prayer will not be rejected.</p>
<p class="bas indent1"><span class="nm">(g)</span><span class="cl">Question:</span> We said that in the first three hours, Hash-m engages in Torah!</p>
<p class="bas indent1"><span class="nm">(h)</span><span class="cl">Answer #1:</span> Rather, the first three hours He judges. The next three He engages in Torah.</p>
<p class="bas indent1"><span class="nm">(i)</span><span class="cl">Answer #2:</span> Really, He engages in Torah then;</p>
<p class="bas indent2"><span class="nm">1.</span>Since Torah is called Emes ("Emes Kene v'Al Timkor"), He does not go beyond the letter of the law at this time;</p>
<p class="bas indent2"><span class="nm">2.</span>Judgment is not called Emes. When He engages in judgment He goes beyond the letter of the law.</p>
<p class="bas indent1"><span class="nm">(j)</span><span class="cl">(R. Yehoshua ben Levi):</span> "Asher Anochi Metzavecha ha'Yom" - today (this world) is for doing Mitzvos, and not tomorrow (the world to come). Today (this world) is for doing Mitzvos, and not for receiving their reward.</p>
<p class="bas indent1"><span class="nm">(k)</span>(R. Yehoshua ben Levi):"Yitenu Edeihem v'Yitzdaku" - Mitzvos that Yisrael do in this world testify for them in the world to come;</p>
<p class="bas indent2"><span class="nm">1.</span>"Va'Yomeru Emes" refers to the Nochrim.</p>
<p class="bas indent1"><span class="nm">(l)</span><span class="cl">(R. Yehoshua ben Levi):</span> Mitzvos that Yisrael do in this world strike the Nochrim on the face in the world to come. It does not say '... u'Vinaschem Neged ha'Amim', rather "l'Einei ha'Amim", in their eyes.</p>
