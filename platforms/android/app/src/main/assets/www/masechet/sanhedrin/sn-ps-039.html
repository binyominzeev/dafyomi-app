<p class="bas indent1"><span class="nm">(a)</span><span class="cl">(R. Yochanan):</span> R. Meir had 300 parables about foxes. We know only three, based on these verses:</p>
<p class="bas indent2"><span class="nm">1.</span>"Avos Yochlu Boser v'Shinei ha'Banim Tikhenah" (Rashi - this teaches that children are punished for their fathers' sins (if they also sin). Maharsha - all the parables teach that Resha'im hope to get a full share in the world to come for minimal effort in this world. In truth, they do not get any share in the world to come.)</p>
<p class="bas indent2"><span class="nm">2.</span>"Moznei Tzedek Avnei Tzedek";</p>
<p class="bas indent2"><span class="nm">3.</span>"Tzadik mi'Tzarah Nechelatz va'Yavo Rasha Tachtav." (Rashi did not explain the Mashalim based on the middle verse. The Maharsha explains it.)</p>
<p class="bas indent1"><span class="nm">(b)</span><span class="cl">Question (a Min):</span> Your G-d steals! "Va'Yapel Hash-m Tardemah Al ha'Adam (and he took a Tzela (rib or side)"!</p>
<p class="bas indent1"><span class="nm">(c)</span><span class="cl">Raban Gamliel's daughter:</span> Allow me to answer.</p>
<p class="bas indent2"><span class="nm">1.</span><span class="cl">His daughter (to the Min):</span> Bring a judge, to hear our claim. Thieves stole a silver flask from us and left a gold flask in its place.</p>
<p class="bas indent2"><span class="nm">2.</span><span class="cl">The Min:</span> I wish such thieves would steal from me!</p>
<p class="bas indent2"><span class="nm">3.</span><span class="cl">His daughter:</span> Wasn't it advantageous for Adam to lose a Tzela and receive a servant!</p>
<p class="bas indent2"><span class="nm">4.</span><span class="cl">The Min:</span> I meant that Hash-m should have taken it openly.</p>
<p class="bas indent2"><span class="nm">5.</span><span class="cl">His daughter:</span> Bring me raw meat. (She roasted it on hot ashes in front of him, and offered him to eat it.)</p>
<p class="bas indent2"><span class="nm">6.</span><span class="cl">The Min:</span> It is repulsive to me (because I saw it before it was ready).</p>
<p class="bas indent2"><span class="nm">7.</span><span class="cl">His daughter:</span> Likewise, had Adam seen his Tzela taken, Chavah would have been repulsive to him.</p>
<p class="bas indent1"><span class="nm">(d)</span><span class="cl">A Min:</span> I know what your G-d is doing.</p>
<p class="bas indent2"><span class="nm">1.</span>Raban Gamliel sighed.</p>
<p class="bas indent2"><span class="nm">2.</span><span class="cl">The Min:</span> What is wrong?</p>
<p class="bas indent2"><span class="nm">3.</span><span class="cl">Raban Gamliel:</span> I have a son overseas, and I long to see him. Please show him to me.</p>
<p class="bas indent2"><span class="nm">4.</span><span class="cl">The Min:</span> I don't know where he is!</p>
<p class="bas indent2"><span class="nm">5.</span><span class="cl">Raban Gamliel:</span> You don't know the whereabouts of those on earth, do you know about the One in Heaven?!</p>
<p class="bas indent1"><span class="nm">(e)</span><span class="cl">A Min:</span> It says "(Hash-m) Moneh Mispar la'Kochavim/" What is so special about this?</p>
<p class="bas indent2"><span class="nm">1.</span><span class="cl">Version #1 - the Min:</span> Even I could do so!</p>
<p class="bas indent2"><span class="nm">2.</span>Raban Gamliel put quince (fruits) in a strainer, and was shaking them around. He asked him to count them.</p>
<p class="bas indent2"><span class="nm">3.</span><span class="cl">The Min:</span> First stop moving them.</p>
<p class="bas indent2"><span class="nm">4.</span><span class="cl">Raban Gamliel:</span> The stars also move!</p>
<p class="bas indent2"><span class="nm">5.</span><span class="cl">Version #2 - the Min:</span> I counted the stars!</p>
<p class="bas indent2"><span class="nm">6.</span><span class="cl">Raban Gamliel:</span> How many molars and teeth do you have? The Min put his hand in his mouth to count them.</p>
<p class="bas indent2"><span class="nm">7.</span><span class="cl">Raban Gamliel:</span> You do not know what is in your mouth. Do you know what is in Heaven?!</p>
<p class="bas indent1"><span class="nm">(f)</span><span class="cl">A Min:</span> Mountains and wind were created by different powers - "Hinei Yotzer Harim u'Vorei Ru'ach." (If one creator made both, it would have say Yotzer or Borei about both!)</p>
<p class="bas indent1"><span class="nm">(g)</span><span class="cl">Rejection (Raban Gamliel):</span> In the creation of man, it says "va'Yivra" and "va'Yitzer". Will you say that different creators made man together?!</p>
<p class="bas indent2"><span class="nm">1.</span>If you want to say this, will you say so even about two (organs in) holes right near each other - "ha'Note'a Ozen... Yotzer Ayin"?!</p>
<p class="bas indent2"><span class="nm">2.</span><span class="cl">The Min:</span> Yes, different creators made them!</p>
<p class="bas indent2"><span class="nm">3.</span><span class="cl">Raban Gamliel:</span> When a man dies, do all his creators simultaneously agree that it is time for him to die?!</p>
<p class="bas indent1"><span class="nm">(h)</span><span class="cl">A witch (to Ameimar):</span> I know (through witchcraft) that the upper half of your body belongs to Hormiz (a Shed (demon)), and the lower half belongs to Hash-m.</p>
<p class="bas indent1"><span class="nm">(i)</span><span class="cl">Rejection (Ameimar):</span> If so, why would Hash-m allow Hormiz to pass wastes of his region (from what I eat) through Hash-m's region (from which I excrete)?!</p>
<p class="bas indent1"><span class="nm">(j)</span><span class="cl">The Kaiser (to R. Tanchum):</span> Let us be one united nation!</p>
<p class="bas indent1"><span class="nm">(k)</span><span class="cl">R. Tanchum:</span> We are circumcised. We cannot be like you. You can circumcise yourselves and be like us!</p>
<p class="bas indent1"><span class="nm">(l)</span><span class="cl">The Kaiser:</span> You are right, but anyone who outwits the king is thrown to the quarry of wild animals.</p>
<p class="bas indent2"><span class="nm">1.</span>They threw him in, but the animals did not eat him.</p>
<p class="bas indent2"><span class="nm">2.</span><span class="cl">A Tzeduki:</span> They did not eat him because they are not hungry.</p>
<p class="bas indent2"><span class="nm">3.</span>They threw the Tzeduki in, and the animals ate him.</p>
<p class="bas indent1"><span class="nm">(m)</span><span class="cl">A Min (to Raban Gamliel):</span> You say that the Shechinah dwells among any 10 Yisraelim. How many Shechinos are there?</p>
<p class="bas indent1"><span class="nm">(n)</span>Raban Gamliel called for the Min's servant, and hit him on the neck. He asked, why did you let the sun enter the Min's house?</p>
<p class="bas indent2"><span class="nm">1.</span><span class="cl">The Min:</span> It enters everywhere!</p>
<p class="bas indent2"><span class="nm">2.</span><span class="cl">Raban Gamliel:</span> The sun is one of billions of servants of Hash-m, and it shines everywhere. All the more so, the Shechinah (can be in many places)!</p>
<p class="bas indent1"><span class="nm">(o)</span><span class="cl">Question #1 (a Min, of R. Avahu):</span> Your G-d is a jokester. He told Yechezkeil "Shechav Al Tzidecha ha'Smoli", then he told him "v'Shochavta Al Tzidecha ha'Yemini"!</p>
<p class="bas indent1"><span class="nm">(p)</span><span class="cl">Question #2 (a Talmid, of R. Avahu):</span> What is the reason for the Mitzvah of Shemitah?</p>
<p class="bas indent1"><span class="nm">(q)</span><span class="cl">Answer (to both questions - R. Avahu):</span> Hash-m told Yisrael to farm for six years and cease in the seventh, in order that they will know that the land is Hash-m's;</p>
<p class="bas indent2"><span class="nm">1.</span>They did not obey, therefore they were exiled.</p>
<p class="bas indent2"><span class="nm">2.</span>If the people of a province rebelled against their (mortal) king:</p>
<p class="bas indent3"><span class="nm">i.</span>If the king is cruel, he will kill all of them. If he is merciful, he will kill half. If he is full of mercy, he will afflict the most important people.</p>
<p class="bas indent2"><span class="nm">3.</span>Likewise, Hash-m afflicted Yechezkeil in order to cleanse the sins of Yisrael.</p>
<p class="bas subject"><span class="nm">2)</span>ANSWERING MINIM (cont.)</p>
<p class="bas indent1"><span class="nm">(a)</span><span class="cl">Question (a Min, of R. Avahu):</span> Your G-d is a Kohen. He commanded "va'Yikchu Li Terumah";</p>
<p class="bas indent2"><span class="nm">1.</span>After he buried Moshe, in what Mikveh did He immerse?</p>
<p class="bas indent2"><span class="nm">2.</span><span class="cl">Suggestion:</span> Perhaps He immersed in water.</p>
<p class="bas indent2"><span class="nm">3.</span><span class="cl">Rejection:</span> "Mi Modad b'Sha'alo Mayim" - all of the water in the world does not even contain His hand!</p>
<p class="bas indent1"><span class="nm">(b)</span><span class="cl">Answer (R. Avahu):</span> He immersed in fire - "Ki Hinei Hash-m b'Esh Yavo."</p>
<p class="bas indent1"><span class="nm">(c)</span><span class="cl">Question (the Min):</span> Does immersing in fire really count in place of immersion?!</p>
<p class="bas indent1"><span class="nm">(d)</span><span class="cl">Answer (R. Avahu):</span> Indeed, that is the preferred immersion - "v'Chol Asher Lo Yavo ba'Esh Ta'aviru va'Mayim."</p>
<p class="bas indent1"><span class="nm">(e)</span><span class="cl">Question (a Min, of R. Avahu):</span> It says "u'Mi ch'Amcha Yisrael Goy Echad ba'Aretz";</p>
<p class="bas indent2"><span class="nm">1.</span>What is special about you? "Kol ha'Goyim k'Ayin Negdo (all the nations, including Yisrael, are insignificant compared to Hash-m)"!</p>
<p class="bas indent1"><span class="nm">(f)</span><span class="cl">Answer (R. Avahu):</span> Your Navi (Bil'am, who was a Nochri) testified that Yisrael are counted separately - "uva'Goyim Lo Yischashav."</p>
<p class="bas bbbline">39b----------------------------------------39b</p>
<p class="bas indent1"><span class="nm">(g)</span><span class="cl">Contradiction (R. Elazar):</span> It says "Tov Hash-m la'Kol", and  it says "Tov Hash-m l'Kovav."</p>
<p class="bas indent1"><span class="nm">(h)</span><span class="cl">Answer (R. Elazar):</span> A parable explains this. If a man owns an orchard, when he waters it (this is done all at once), he waters all the trees. When he prunes (this is done one tree at a time), he only prunes the good trees.</p>
<p class="bas subject"><span class="nm">3)</span>DESTRUCTION OF RESHA'IM</p>
<p class="bas indent1"><span class="nm">(a)</span><span class="cl">(Mishnah):</span> Therefore, everyone must say...("uva'Avod Resha'im Rinah").</p>
<p class="bas indent1"><span class="nm">(b)</span><span class="cl">(Rav Acha bar Chanina):</span> "Va'Ya'avor <i>ha</i>'Rinah ba'Machaneh" - <i>the</i> joy was the death of Achav.</p>
<p class="bas indent1"><span class="nm">(c)</span><span class="cl">Question:</span> Hash-m is not happy with the downfall of Resha'im!</p>
<p class="bas indent2"><span class="nm">1.</span><span class="cl">(R. Yochanan):</span> "B'Tzeis Lifnei ha'Chalutz v'Omrim Hodu la'Shem Ki l'Olam Chasdo" - it does not say "Ki Tov", because Hash-m is not happy with the downfall of Resha'im.</p>
<p class="bas indent2"><span class="nm">2.</span><span class="cl">(R. Shmuel bar Nachman):</span> "V'Lo Karav Zeh El Zeh Kol ha'Laylah" - the angels wanted to sing in front of Hash-m on the night of Kri'as Yam Suf;</p>
<p class="bas indent3"><span class="nm">i.</span><span class="cl">Hash-m:</span> My creations are drowning in the sea, and you want to sing in front of Me?!</p>
<p class="bas indent1"><span class="nm">(d)</span><span class="cl">Answer (R. Yosi b'Rebbi Chanina):</span> Hash-m is not happy, but he makes others rejoice;</p>
<p class="bas indent2"><span class="nm">1.</span>It says "Yasis" (He will make our enemies rejoice over our downfall), it does not say 'Yasos' (He will rejoice).</p>
<p class="bas indent1"><span class="nm">(e)</span><span class="cl">(R. Elazar):</span> "<i>Veha'Zonos</i> Rachatzu (when Achav died)" - his death cleansed (clarified) two <i>Chezyonos</i> (prophetic visions), of Michayhu and Eliyahu.</p>
<p class="bas indent2"><span class="nm">1.</span>It says in Michayhu "Im Shov Tashuv b'Shalom" (i.e. you will not return safely);</p>
<p class="bas indent2"><span class="nm">2.</span>It says in Eliyahu "bi'Mkom Asher Lakeku ka'Kelavim Es Dam Navos (they will lick your blood)."</p>
<p class="bas indent1"><span class="nm">(f)</span><span class="cl">(Rava):</span> The verse discusses actual Zonos (harlots). Achav was easily chilled, so Izevel made two pictures of harlots in his chariot, to excite him and warm him. (When he died, they were washed with his blood.)</p>
<p class="bas indent1"><span class="nm">(g)</span><span class="cl">(R. Elazar):</span> "V'Ish Mashach ba'Keshes l'Sumo va'Yakeh" - it was l'Fi Tumo (he did not realize that this was Melech Yisrael);</p>
<p class="bas indent1"><span class="nm">(h)</span><span class="cl">(Rava):</span> This was in order Lesumam (to complete) the (above) prophecies.</p>
<p class="bas subject"><span class="nm">4)</span>OVADYAH</p>
<p class="bas indent1"><span class="nm">(a)</span><span class="cl">Question:</span> "Va'Yikra Achav El Ovadyahu... v'Ovadyahu Yarei Es Hash-m Me'od" - why does it digress to say this?</p>
<p class="bas indent1"><span class="nm">(b)</span><span class="cl">Answer (R. Yitzchak):</span> Achav asked Ovadyahu 'Lavan said to Yakov "Nichashti va'Yvoracheni Hash-m Biglalecha." It says about Yosef "va'Yvorech Hash-m Es Beis ha'Mitzri Biglal Yosef";</p>
<p class="bas indent2"><span class="nm">1.</span>Why wasn't my house blessed? Perhaps you do not fear Hash-m?!'</p>
<p class="bas indent2"><span class="nm">2.</span><span class="cl">A Bas Kol (voice from Heaven):</span> "V'Ovadyahu Yarei Es Hash-m Me'od." Achav's house is not worthy to be blessed.</p>
<p class="bas indent1"><span class="nm">(c)</span><span class="cl">(R. Aba):</span> The verse praises Ovadyahu more than Avraham! The Torah says that Avraham feared Hash-m, but it does not say 'Me'od'</p>
<p class="bas indent1"><span class="nm">(d)</span><span class="cl">(R. Yitzchak):</span> Ovadyahu merited prophecy because he hid 100 Nevi'im in two caves - "b'Hachris Izevel Es Nevi'ei Hash-m va'Yikach Ovadyahu... Chamishim Ish ba'Me'arah."</p>
<p class="bas indent1"><span class="nm">(e)</span><span class="cl">Question:</span> Why did he put 50 in each cave (and not all 100 in one cave)?</p>
<p class="bas indent1"><span class="nm">(f)</span><span class="cl">Answer #1 (R. Elazar):</span> He learned from Yakov, who split his children into two camps. (If Esav will kill one,) "the other camp will survive."</p>
<p class="bas indent1"><span class="nm">(g)</span><span class="cl">Answer #2 (R. Avahu):</span> Neither cave had room for more than 50.</p>
<p class="bas indent1"><span class="nm">(h)</span><span class="cl">Question:</span> "Chazon Ovadyah... le'Edom" - why did Ovadyahu receive the prophecy for Edom?</p>
<p class="bas indent1"><span class="nm">(i)</span><span class="cl">Answer #1 (R. Yitzchak):</span> Ovadyahu lived among two Resha'im (Achav and Izevel), but he did not learn from their ways, therefore he prophecized about (the descendants of) Esav, who lived among two Tzadikim (Yitzchak and Rivka) and did not learn from their ways.</p>
<p class="bas indent1"><span class="nm">(j)</span><span class="cl">Answer #2 (Efrayim Maksh'ah):</span> Ovadyahu was a convert from Edom.</p>
<p class="bas indent2"><span class="nm">1.</span>This is like people say, the handle of the ax used to chop trees of the forest comes from the forest itself. (The one who prophecized the downfall of Edom came from Edom.)</p>
<p class="bas indent1"><span class="nm">(k)</span><span class="cl">(R. Yochanan):</span> "Va'Yach (David) Es Mo'av..." - this is like people say 'the ax handle comes from the forest itself (the one who struck Mo'av descends from (Rus, who was from) Mo'av).</p>
<p class="bas indent2"><span class="nm">1.</span><span class="cl">(Rav Dimi):</span> A thigh decays from the inside.</p>
<p class="bas subject"><span class="nm">5)</span>MEISHA'S OFFERING (OF HIS SON)</p>
<p class="bas indent1"><span class="nm">(a)</span><span class="cl">(Rav or Shmuel):</span> "Va'Yikach (Meisha, the king of Mo'av) Es Beno... va'Ya'alehu Olah" - he intended for the sake of Heaven;</p>
<p class="bas indent1"><span class="nm">(b)</span><span class="cl">(The other of Rav and Shmuel):</span> He intended to serve idolatry.</p>
<p class="bas indent1"><span class="nm">(c)</span><span class="cl">Question:</span> "Va'Yhi Ketzef Gadol Al Yisrael" - this is like the opinion that he intended for the sake of Heaven (Yisrael was acting to anger Hash-m, so we were more liable by contrast);</p>
<p class="bas indent2"><span class="nm">1.</span>However,  according to the opinion that he intended for idolatry, why did this arouse Hash-m's anger against Yisrael?!</p>
<p class="bas indent1"><span class="nm">(d)</span><span class="cl">Answer:</span> We learn from R. Yehoshua ben Levi.</p>
<p class="bas indent2"><span class="nm">1.</span><span class="cl">Contradiction (R. Yehoshua ben Levi):</span> It says "uch'Mishpetei ha'Goyim... Lo Asisem", and it says "uch'Mishpetei ha'Goyim... Asisem"!</p>
<p class="bas indent2"><span class="nm">2.</span><span class="cl">Answer (R. Yehoshua ben Levi):</span> We did not do like their good deeds. We did like their bad deeds. (Meisha's act alluded to sins of Yisrael.)</p>
<p class="bas indent1"><span class="nm">(e)</span><span class="cl">(R. Chanina bar Papa):</span> "Va'Yis'u me'Alav va'Yashuvu la'Aretz" - at that time, Yisrael's deeds reached the Aretz, i.e. the lowest level.</p>
<p class="bas indent1"><span class="nm">(f)</span><span class="cl">(R. Chanina bar Papa):</span> "Veha'Na'arah Yafah <i>Ad</i> Me'od" - it does not say (only) 'Me'od', for Avishag was not half as beautiful as Sarah.</p>
