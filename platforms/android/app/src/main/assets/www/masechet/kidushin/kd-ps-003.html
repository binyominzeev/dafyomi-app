<p class="bas subject"><span class="nm">1)</span>THE STATUS OF ESROGIM</p>
<p class="bas indent1"><span class="nm">(a)</span><span class="cl">Question (Mishnah):</span> An Esrog is like a tree in three Derachim.</p>
<p class="bas indent2"><span class="nm">1.</span>It should say 'Devarim' (to enable using the masculine form Sheloshah)!</p>
<p class="bas indent1"><span class="nm">(b)</span><span class="cl">Answer:</span> It says 'Derachim' for parallel structure with the Reisha, which says that it is like vegetables in one Derech.</p>
<p class="bas indent1"><span class="nm">(c)</span><span class="cl">Question:</span> The Reisha should also say 'Davar"!</p>
<p class="bas indent1"><span class="nm">(d)</span><span class="cl">Answer:</span> The Reisha teaches that an Esrog has the nature of vegetables;</p>
<p class="bas indent2"><span class="nm">1.</span>Just like vegetables grow from all water (we irrigate them), and we take Ma'aser according to the year in which they are picked, also Esrogim.</p>
<p class="bas indent1"><span class="nm">(e)</span><span class="cl">Question:</span> Why do the following Mishnayos say 'Derachim' rather than 'Devarim'?</p>
<p class="bas indent2"><span class="nm">1.</span><span class="cl">(Mishnah):</span> In some Derachim, a Koy (a crossbreed of deer and goats; some say that it is a species unto itself) is like a Chayah (wild animal). In some ways it is like a Beheimah (domestic animal). In some ways it is like both. In some ways it is like as neither.</p>
<p class="bas indent2"><span class="nm">2.</span><span class="cl">(Mishnah):</span> This is one of the Derachim in which Gitin of divorce are as Gitin or freedom.</p>
<p class="bas indent1"><span class="nm">(f)</span><span class="cl">Answer:</span> Wherever there are different ways, the Tana teaches 'Derachim'. When all ways are similar, he says 'Devarim'.</p>
<p class="bas indent1"><span class="nm">(g)</span><span class="cl">Support (Mishnah - R. Eliezer):</span> An Esrog is like a tree in all Devarim.</p>
<p class="bas subject"><span class="nm">2)</span>CASES EXCLUDED BY THE MISHNAH</p>
<p class="bas indent1"><span class="nm">(a)</span><span class="cl">(Mishnah):</span> A woman is acquired in any of (only) three ways, and acquires her independence through either of (only) two ways.</p>
<p class="bas indent1"><span class="nm">(b)</span><span class="cl">Question:</span> What other ways might we have thought also work?</p>
<p class="bas indent1"><span class="nm">(c)</span><span class="cl">Answer (part 1):</span> She is acquired in any of three ways, but not through Chupah (entering his Reshus for the sake of marriage).</p>
<p class="bas indent1"><span class="nm">(d)</span><span class="cl">Question:</span> According to Rav Huna, who says that Chupah makes Kidushin, what is excluded?</p>
<p class="bas indent1"><span class="nm">(e)</span><span class="cl">Answer:</span> It excludes Chalipin (acquisition through exchange);</p>
<p class="bas indent2"><span class="nm">1.</span>We learn a Gezeirah Shavah "Kichah-Kichah" from the sale of Efron's field. One might have thought that just like a field may be acquired through Chalipin, also a woman. The Mishnah teaches that this is not so.</p>
<p class="bas indent1"><span class="nm">(f)</span><span class="cl">Question:</span> Why does Chalipin not work?</p>
<p class="bas indent1"><span class="nm">(g)</span><span class="cl">Answer:</span> Chalipin works with (a Kli) less than the value of a Perutah. A woman does not acquire herself to a man through such a Kinyan (Rashi. Tosfos - since it works with less than a Perutah, this shows that it is not Kinyan Kesef.)</p>
<p class="bas bbbline">3b----------------------------------------3b</p>
<p class="bas indent1"><span class="nm">(h)</span><span class="cl">Answer (part 2):</span> She acquires her independence through either of two ways, but not Chalitzah.</p>
<p class="bas indent1"><span class="nm">(i)</span>One might have thought that a Kal va'Chomer teaches that Chalitzah works.</p>
<p class="bas indent2"><span class="nm">1.</span>A Yevamah is not permitted through a Get, but Chalitzah permits her. A wife is permitted through a Get, and all the more so through Chalitzah! The Mishnah teaches that this is not so.</p>
<p class="bas indent2"><span class="nm">2.</span><span class="cl">Question:</span> What is the reason?</p>
<p class="bas indent2"><span class="nm">3.</span><span class="cl">Answer:</span> "A Sefer of cutting" - a Sefer cuts her off, and nothing else does.</p>
<p class="bas subject"><span class="nm">3)</span>THE FATHER RECEIVES KIDUSHIN MONEY</p>
<p class="bas indent1"><span class="nm">(a)</span><span class="cl">(Mishnah):</span> A woman is acquired through money...</p>
<p class="bas indent1"><span class="nm">(b)</span><span class="cl">Question #1:</span> What is the source that money makes Kidushin?</p>
<p class="bas indent1"><span class="nm">(c)</span><span class="cl">Question #2:</span> A Mishnah teaches that a man may be Mekadesh his daughter (before Bagrus) through money, a document, or Bi'ah. What is the source that money works, and that the father gets the money?</p>
<p class="bas indent1"><span class="nm">(d)</span><span class="cl">Answer (to both questions - Rav Yehudah):</span> "V'Yatz'ah Chinam Ein Kasef" (when an Amah Ivriyah, i.e. a Yisre'elis slave, becomes a Na'arah (adult, upon bringing two hairs after 12 years), she goes free without money). Her master gets no money, but another 'master' (her father) gets money (when she leaves him through Kidushin).</p>
<p class="bas indent1"><span class="nm">(e)</span><span class="cl">Question:</span> Perhaps there is no money when an Amah goes free, but there is money when a girl becomes Mekudeshes, and she gets the money!</p>
<p class="bas indent1"><span class="nm">(f)</span><span class="cl">Answer:</span> We learn that her father can be Mekadesh her from "I gave my daughter to this man." It is unreasonable that he is Mekadesh her, and she gets the money!</p>
<p class="bas indent1"><span class="nm">(g)</span><span class="cl">Question:</span> Perhaps this is only regarding a minor, who has no Yad (power of acquisition) to receive Kidushin. A Na'arah has a Yad to receive Kidushin, perhaps she can be Mekadesh herself and keep the money!</p>
<p class="bas indent1"><span class="nm">(h)</span><span class="cl">Answer #1:</span> "Bi'N'ureha Beis Aviha" teaches that all revenue of a Na'arah goes to her father.</p>
<p class="bas indent1"><span class="nm">(i)</span><span class="cl">Objection - Question (Rav Huna):</span> What is the source that a girl's earnings belong to her father?</p>
<p class="bas indent2"><span class="nm">1.</span><span class="cl">Answer:</span> "V'Chi Yimkor Ish Es Bito l'Amah" equates a daughter to a slave. Just like a slave's earnings belong to her master, a girl's earnings belong to her father.</p>
<p class="bas indent2"><span class="nm">2.</span><span class="cl">Question:</span> Why don't we learn this from "bi'N'ureha Beis Aviha"?</p>
<p class="bas indent2"><span class="nm">3.</span><span class="cl">Answer:</span> We must say that the verse teaches about (her father's ability to annul her) vows, but not to earnings.</p>
<p class="bas indent2"><span class="nm">4.</span><span class="cl">Summation of Objection:</span> Likewise, the verse teaches about vows, not about Kidushin!</p>
<p class="bas indent1"><span class="nm">(j)</span><span class="cl">Answer #2:</span> Even though the verse teaches about vows, we should learn from vows (to money, i.e. Kidushin! Tosfos Rid - we ask why another verse ("Bito l'Amah") must teach about earnings.)</p>
<p class="bas indent1"><span class="nm">(k)</span><span class="cl">Rejection:</span> We cannot learn monetary laws from Isurim.</p>
<p class="bas indent1"><span class="nm">(l)</span><span class="cl">Answer #3:</span> A father receives the (50 Shekel) fine that a rapist or enticer pays. We should learn from there!</p>
<p class="bas indent1"><span class="nm">(m)</span><span class="cl">Rejection:</span> We do not learn standard monetary laws from fines.</p>
<p class="bas indent1"><span class="nm">(n)</span><span class="cl">Answer #4:</span> A father receives the money that a rapist or enticer pays for the embarrassment and blemish he caused (these vary according to people involved. They are not fines.) We should learn from them!</p>
<p class="bas indent1"><span class="nm">(o)</span><span class="cl">Rejection:</span> We cannot learn from them. The father receives them because he also suffers from the embarrassment and blemish!</p>
<p class="bas indent1"><span class="nm">(p)</span><span class="cl">Answer #5:</span> Rather, the verse contrasts similar departures. (When an Amah leaves, one might have thought that the master she leaves would get money, but he does not. When a girl become Mekudeshes, the one she leaves (her father) gets money.)</p>
