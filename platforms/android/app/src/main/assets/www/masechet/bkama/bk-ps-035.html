<p class="dedicationbox"><br>PAST DEDICATION<br>BAVA KAMA 33-35 - Two weeks of study material have been dedicated by Mrs. Estanne Abraham Fawer to honor the ninth Yahrzeit of her father, Rav Mordechai ben Eliezer Zvi (Rabbi Morton Weiner) Z'L, who passed away on 18 Teves 5760. May the merit of supporting and advancing Dafyomi study -- which was so important to him -- during the weeks of his Yahrzeit serve as an Iluy for his Neshamah. </p>

<p class="bas subject"><span class="nm">1)</span>MONETARY LIABILITY OF ONE LIABLE TO DIE (cont.)</p>
<p class="bas indent1"><span class="nm">(a)</span><span class="cl">Answer #1:</span> The case in which his ox burned is like when he burned. Just like he burns for a need, also his ox.</p>
<p class="bas indent2"><span class="nm">1.</span><span class="cl">Question:</span> What is the case?</p>
<p class="bas indent2"><span class="nm">2.</span><span class="cl">Answer (Rav Avya):</span> An intelligent ox was bitten on the back. It wants the ashes to roll in them.</p>
<p class="bas indent2"><span class="nm">3.</span><span class="cl">Question:</span> Question: How do we know that this is why it burned?</p>
<p class="bas indent2"><span class="nm">4.</span><span class="cl">Answer:</span> Afterwards, it rolled in the ashes.</p>
<p class="bas indent2"><span class="nm">5.</span><span class="cl">Question:</span> Are there really such intelligent oxen?</p>
<p class="bas indent2"><span class="nm">6.</span><span class="cl">Answer:</span> Yes! Rav Papa's ox had a toothache. It opened a barrel of beer, drank and was healed.</p>
<p class="bas indent1"><span class="nm">(b)</span><span class="cl">Question (Rabanan):</span> How can we say that the case of his ox is like himself? It also teaches when they embarrassed!</p>
<p class="bas indent2"><span class="nm">1.</span>Reuven is liable, so he must have intended. How can we find this regarding an ox?</p>
<p class="bas indent1"><span class="nm">(c)</span><span class="cl">Answer:</span> The case is, it intended to damage;</p>
<p class="bas indent2"><span class="nm">1.</span>If a man intended to damage, even though he did not intend to embarrass, he pays for embarrassment.</p>
<p class="bas indent1"><span class="nm">(d)</span><span class="cl">Answer #2 (Rava):</span> In the Mishnah, (Reuven and his ox) burned b'Shogeg.</p>
<p class="bas indent2"><span class="nm">1.</span><span class="cl">(Tana d'Vei Chizkiyah):</span> The Torah equates "one who strikes (i.e. kills) a man" and "one who strikes an animal":</p>
<p class="bas indent2"><span class="nm">2.</span>One who strikes an animal always pays, without distinction between Shogeg or Mezid, whether he hit going downward or upward. Similarly, one who strikes a man never pays, without distinction. (The same applies to all capital sins.)</p>
<p class="bas indent1"><span class="nm">(e)</span><span class="cl">Question (Rabanan):</span> How can you say that in the Mishnah, he burned b'Shogeg? It says, he is judged to die!</p>
<p class="bas indent1"><span class="nm">(f)</span><span class="cl">Answer (Rava):</span> Had he intended, he would be judged to die, i.e. if he needed the ashes. Therefore, even b'Shogeg, he does not pay.</p>
<p class="bas subject"><span class="nm">2)</span>DISPUTE OVER WHO DAMAGED</p>
<p class="bas indent1"><span class="nm">(a)</span><span class="cl">(Mishnah):</span> If Reuven's ox was chasing Shimon's ox, and we see Shimon's ox wounded, and Shimon says that Reuven's ox damaged it, and Reuven says that it was hurt on a stone, ha'Motzi me'Chaveiro Alav ha'Re'ayah (the one who wants to collect (Shimon) must bring proof).</p>
<p class="bas indent1"><span class="nm">(b)</span>If Reuven's and Shimon's oxen were chasing Levi's ox, and it was damaged, and Reuven says 'your ox damaged', and Shimon says 'no, rather, your ox damaged', they are exempt.</p>
<p class="bas bbbline">35b----------------------------------------35b</p>
<p class="bas indent2"><span class="nm">1.</span>If both chasing oxen belonged to Reuven, they are liable.</p>
<p class="bas indent2"><span class="nm">2.</span>If one was big (or Mu'ad), and the other small (a Tam), and Levi says 'the big one (or Mu'ad) damaged', and Reuven says 'no, the small (Tam) one damaged', ha'Motzi me'Chaveiro Alav ha'Re'ayah. (Levi collects no more than the value of the small Tam ox.)</p>
<p class="bas indent1"><span class="nm">(c)</span>If two oxen of Reuven damaged two of Levi's oxen, and Levi says that the big ox (or the Mu'ad) damaged the big ox, and the small ox (or the Tam) damaged the small ox, and Reuven says oppositely, ha'Motzi me'Chaveiro Alav ha'Re'ayah.</p>
<p class="bas subject"><span class="nm">3)</span>WHAT DO WE DO WHEN IN DOUBT?</p>
<p class="bas indent1"><span class="nm">(a)</span><span class="cl">(Gemara - R. Chiya bar Aba):</span> Our Mishnah teaches that Chachamim argue with Sumchus, who says that when in doubt, we split the money.</p>
<p class="bas indent1"><span class="nm">(b)</span><span class="cl">Question (R. Aba bar Mamal):</span> Did Sumchus say so even when both sides make definite claims?</p>
<p class="bas indent1"><span class="nm">(c)</span><span class="cl">Answer (R. Chiya bar Aba):</span> Yes.</p>
<p class="bas indent2"><span class="nm">1.</span><span class="cl">Question:</span> What is the source that in our Mishnah, their claims are definite?</p>
<p class="bas indent2"><span class="nm">2.</span><span class="cl">Answer:</span> It says 'this one says 'your ox damaged', and the other says 'no, rather...''</p>
<p class="bas indent1"><span class="nm">(d)</span><span class="cl">Question (Rav Papa):</span> If in the Reisha both are definite, also in the Seifa!</p>
<p class="bas indent2"><span class="nm">1.</span><span class="cl">(Seifa):</span> If one was big (or Mu'ad), and the other small (Tam), and Levi says 'the big one (or Mu'ad) damaged' and Reuven says 'no, rather the small (Tam) one damaged', ha'Motzi me'Chaveiro Alav ha'Re'ayah.</p>
<p class="bas indent2"><span class="nm">2.</span><span class="cl">(Inference):</span> If Levi cannot bring proof, he collects like Reuven said.</p>
<p class="bas indent2"><span class="nm">3.</span><span class="cl">Summation of question:</span> If so, this refutes Rabah bar Nasan!</p>
<p class="bas indent3"><span class="nm">i.</span><span class="cl">(Rabah bar Nasan):</span> If Reuven claimed that Shimon owes him wheat, and Shimon admitted that he owes barley, Shimon is exempt (even for giving barley. Reuven pardoned him for it.)</p>
<p class="bas indent1"><span class="nm">(e)</span><span class="cl">Answer (Rav Papa):</span> Rather, in the Seifa one party is definite, and the other is unsure.</p>
<p class="bas indent1"><span class="nm">(f)</span><span class="cl">Question:</span> Which is definite?</p>
<p class="bas indent2"><span class="nm">1.</span>If the damager is unsure and the victim is definite, this still refutes Rabah bar Nasan!</p>
<p class="bas indent1"><span class="nm">(g)</span><span class="cl">Answer:</span> Rather, the damager is definite, and the victim is unsure.</p>
<p class="bas indent1"><span class="nm">(h)</span><span class="cl">Inference:</span> Also in the Reisha, the damager is definite, and the victim is unsure.</p>
<p class="bas indent1"><span class="nm">(i)</span><span class="cl">Question:</span> Does Sumchus say even in this case that we split the money, and therefore our Tana needed to teach unlike him?</p>
<p class="bas indent1"><span class="nm">(j)</span><span class="cl">Answer:</span> No. In the Reisha, the damager is unsure and the victim is definite.</p>
<p class="bas indent1"><span class="nm">(k)</span><span class="cl">Question:</span> It is difficult to say that the Reisha and Seifa discuss different cases!</p>
<p class="bas indent1"><span class="nm">(l)</span><span class="cl">Answer:</span> When one side is sure, and the other is not, it makes little difference which side is sure;</p>
<p class="bas indent2"><span class="nm">1.</span>When both sides are sure is very different than when only one side is sure.</p>
<p class="bas subject"><span class="nm">4)</span>ADMISSION UNLIKE THE CLAIM</p>
<p class="bas indent1"><span class="nm">(a)</span><span class="cl">(Rabah bar Nasan):</span> If Reuven claimed that Shimon owes him wheat, and Shimon admitted that he owes barley, Shimon is exempt.</p>
<p class="bas indent1"><span class="nm">(b)</span><span class="cl">Question:</span> A Mishnah teaches this!</p>
<p class="bas indent2"><span class="nm">1.</span><span class="cl">(Mishnah):</span> If Reuven claimed that Shimon owes him wheat, and Shimon admitted that he owes barley, Shimon is exempt.</p>
<p class="bas indent1"><span class="nm">(c)</span><span class="cl">Answer:</span> One might have thought that he is exempt from paying wheat, but he must pay barley. Rabah bar Nasan teaches that he is totally exempt.</p>
<p class="bas indent1"><span class="nm">(d)</span><span class="cl">(Mishnah):</span> If two oxen of Reuven, one big and one small...</p>
<p class="bas indent1"><span class="nm">(e)</span><span class="cl">(Inference):</span> If Levi cannot bring proof, he collects like Reuven says.</p>
<p class="bas indent1"><span class="nm">(f)</span><span class="cl">Question:</span> This is like wheat and barley (and Rabbah bar Nasan totally exempts)!</p>
<p class="bas indent1"><span class="nm">(g)</span><span class="cl">Answer:</span> Rather, if Levi cannot bring proof, he should collect like Reuven says, but does not collect at all.</p>
<p class="bas indent1"><span class="nm">(h)</span><span class="cl">Question (Beraisa):</span> Levi collects for the small ox from the big ox, and for the big ox from the small ox.</p>
<p class="bas indent1"><span class="nm">(i)</span><span class="cl">Answer:</span> That is when Levi seized the damager.</p>
<p class="bas indent1"><span class="nm">(j)</span><span class="cl">(Mishnah):</span> If two oxen of Reuven, one Tam and one Mu'ad... Levi says that the Mu'ad damaged the big ox and the Tam damaged the small ox, and Reuven says, no, it was the other way, ha'Motzi me'Chaveiro Alav ha'Re'ayah.</p>
<p class="bas indent1"><span class="nm">(k)</span><span class="cl">(Inference):</span> If Levi cannot bring proof, he collects like Reuven says.</p>
<p class="bas indent1"><span class="nm">(l)</span><span class="cl">Question:</span> This is like wheat and barley!</p>
<p class="bas indent1"><span class="nm">(m)</span><span class="cl">Answer:</span> If Levi cannot bring proof, he should collect like Reuven says.</p>
<p class="bas indent1"><span class="nm">(n)</span><span class="cl">Question (Beraisa):</span> Levi collects for the small ox from the Mu'ad, and for the big ox from the Tam.</p>
<p class="bas indent1"><span class="nm">(o)</span><span class="cl">Answer:</span> That is when Levi seized the damager.</p>
