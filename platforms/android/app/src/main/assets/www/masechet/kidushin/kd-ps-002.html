<p class="dedicationbox">KIDUSHIN 2 (Tishrei 11) - sponsored by Hillel and Elisheva (Ali) Kagan of Baltimore. May Hashem bless them with a year of Berachah and joy, and all of their prayers should be answered "l'Tovah"! </p>

<p class="bas subject"><span class="nm">1)</span>METHODS OF KIDUSHIN</p>
<p class="bas indent1"><span class="nm">(a)</span><span class="cl">(Mishnah):</span> A woman is acquired (Mekudeshes) in any of three ways, and acquires her independence (to marry someone else) through either of two ways:</p>
<p class="bas indent2"><span class="nm">1.</span>She is acquired through money, a document, or Bi'ah (marital relations);</p>
<p class="bas indent1"><span class="nm">(b)</span>Beis Shamai say that Kidushin through money must be (at least) a Dinar or something worth a Dinar;</p>
<p class="bas indent1"><span class="nm">(c)</span>Beis Hillel say, it must be (at least) a Perutah or something worth a Perutah;</p>
<p class="bas indent2"><span class="nm">1.</span>A Perutah is one eighth of an Italian Isar.</p>
<p class="bas indent1"><span class="nm">(d)</span>A wife acquires her independence through a Get, or death of her husband.</p>
<p class="bas indent1"><span class="nm">(e)</span>A Yevamah (one whose husband died without children) is acquired (to the Yavam, i.e. her husband's brother) through Bi'ah (with him). She acquires her independence through Chalitzah (taking off his shoe) or death of the Yavam.</p>
<p class="bas subject"><span class="nm">2)</span>THE WORDING OF THE MISHNAH</p>
<p class="bas indent1"><span class="nm">(a)</span><span class="cl">(Gemara) Question:</span> Why does our Mishnah say 'a woman is acquired', whereas the Mishnah (41a) says 'a man is Mekadesh'?</p>
<p class="bas indent1"><span class="nm">(b)</span><span class="cl">Answer:</span> Our Mishnah teaches that one of the methods is through money. We learn that money works from a Gezeirah Shavah "Kichah-Kichah" from Avraham's purchase of Efron's field, and "Kichah" is called Kinyan (acquisition);</p>
<p class="bas bbbline">2b----------------------------------------2b</p>
<p class="bas indent2"><span class="nm">1.</span>Alternatively, "fields will be acquired through money" teaches that money is called an acquisition.</p>
<p class="bas indent1"><span class="nm">(c)</span><span class="cl">Question:</span> Why does the Mishnah (41a) not say 'a man acquires'?</p>
<p class="bas indent1"><span class="nm">(d)</span><span class="cl">Answer:</span> First, the Mishnah uses the wording of the Torah. Later, it uses the wording of Chachamim;</p>
<p class="bas indent2"><span class="nm">1.</span>Chachamim call it 'Kidushin' because it forbids a woman to all other men, just like Hekdesh is forbidden to all.</p>
<p class="bas indent1"><span class="nm">(e)</span><span class="cl">Question:</span> Why did our Tana say 'a woman is acquired,' as opposed to 'a man acquires'?</p>
<p class="bas indent1"><span class="nm">(f)</span><span class="cl">Answer #1:</span> Because the Seifa teaches 'she acquires her independence', also the Reisha speaks from her perspective.</p>
<p class="bas indent2"><span class="nm">1.</span><span class="cl">Question:</span> We could have taught both from his perspective, 'a man acquires' and 'a man is Makneh (makes her acquire)!</p>
<p class="bas indent2"><span class="nm">2.</span><span class="cl">Answer:</span> One case (in which she acquires her independence) is when her husband dies. He is not Makneh, it is through the hands of Heaven.</p>
<p class="bas indent1"><span class="nm">(g)</span><span class="cl">Answer #2:</span> Had it said 'a man acquires,' this would connote that he acquires against her will. Therefore, it says 'ahe is acquired,' which connotes (only) willingly.</p>
<p class="bas indent1"><span class="nm">(h)</span><span class="cl">Question:</span> Why does the Mishnah say 'Shalosh' (the feminine form of 'three'), and not 'Sheloshah'?</p>
<p class="bas indent1"><span class="nm">(i)</span><span class="cl">Answer:</span> It teaches three Derachim (ways), and Derech is feminine - "the Derech that they will go Bah (in it, feminine)".</p>
<p class="bas indent1"><span class="nm">(j)</span><span class="cl">Question (Mishnah):</span> In Shiv'ah (the masculine for seven) Derachim we check if there was an external cause for a man's emissions (of Zivah, i.e. uncooked semen. If there was a cause, he does not become a Zav.)</p>
<p class="bas indent1"><span class="nm">(k)</span><span class="cl">Answer:</span> The word 'Derech' is masculine, like it says "b'Derech Echad (masculine)..."</p>
<p class="bas indent1"><span class="nm">(l)</span><span class="cl">Contradiction:</span> The verses contradict each other, and the Mishnayos contradict each other!</p>
<p class="bas indent1"><span class="nm">(m)</span><span class="cl">Answer:</span> 'Derech' adopts the gender of what it refers to.</p>
<p class="bas indent2"><span class="nm">1.</span>"The Derech that they will go in it" refers to Torah, which is feminine. "In one Derech..." discusses war. Generally, men wage war.</p>
<p class="bas indent2"><span class="nm">2.</span>Our Mishnah speaks from the woman's perspective. The Mishnah about a Zav is in the masculine, for we check only men, not women.</p>
<p class="bas indent3"><span class="nm">i.</span>This is because a woman who sees (non-menstrual) blood (on certain days) becomes a Zavah even if there was an external cause.</p>
<p class="bas indent1"><span class="nm">(n)</span><span class="cl">Question:</span> Why does the Mishnah say Shalosh, due to Derachim? The Mishnah should say Devarim (matters, instead of Derachim), and then it can say Sheloshah! (Normally, we use the masculine.)</p>
<p class="bas indent1"><span class="nm">(o)</span><span class="cl">Answer #1:</span> We chose Derech, for one of the methods of Kidushin is Bi'ah, which is called Derech.</p>
<p class="bas indent2"><span class="nm">1.</span><span class="cl">Question:</span> We do not find that money or a document is called Derech!</p>
<p class="bas indent2"><span class="nm">2.</span><span class="cl">Answer:</span> Still, we say 'Derech' regarding them, because it is more appropriate for Bi'ah.</p>
<p class="bas indent2"><span class="nm">3.</span><span class="cl">Question:</span> We should not alter the expression regarding two methods in order to make it more appropriate for one method!</p>
<p class="bas indent2"><span class="nm">4.</span><span class="cl">Answer:</span> Those two methods are just means to the purpose, which is Bi'ah.</p>
<p class="bas indent1"><span class="nm">(p)</span><span class="cl">Answer #2:</span> Our Mishnah is like R. Shimon, therefore it says Derachim.</p>
<p class="bas indent2"><span class="nm">1.</span><span class="cl">(Beraisa) Question:</span> Why did the Torah say that a man takes a woman, and not vice-versa?</p>
<p class="bas indent2"><span class="nm">2.</span><span class="cl">Answer (R. Shimon):</span> It is because it is the Derech (way) of the man to purse the woman, and not vice-versa;</p>
<p class="bas indent3"><span class="nm">i.</span>Woman was taken (created) from man. Normally, the one who lost an object, he looks for it.</p>
<p class="bas indent1"><span class="nm">(q)</span><span class="cl">Question:</span> Why did the Mishnah teach 'in seven Derachim we check...'? It should say 'Devarim'!</p>
<p class="bas indent1"><span class="nm">(r)</span><span class="cl">Answer:</span> The Tana hints that it is the Derech (nature) of excessive eating and drinking to induce emissions.</p>
