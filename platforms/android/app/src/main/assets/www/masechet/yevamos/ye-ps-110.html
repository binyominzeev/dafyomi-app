<div class="subject"><span class="nm">1)</span><p>WHEN DOES A MARRIAGE MID'RABANAN BECOME MID'ORAISA?</p></div>
<div class="indent1"><span class="nm">(a)</span><p><span class="cl">Question:</span> Rav does not hold that it becomes mid'Oraisa only if they have Bi'ah!</p></div>
<div class="indent2"><span class="nm">1.</span><p><span class="cl">(Rav):</span> If a minor did not do Mi'un, and she married another man after she matured, she does not need a Get from the second man;</p></div>
<div class="indent2"><span class="nm">2.</span><p><span class="cl">(Shmuel):</span> She needs a Get from the second man.</p></div>
<div class="indent2"><span class="nm">3.</span><p><span class="cl">Suggestion:</span> They argue about when she did not have Bi'ah with her first husband after maturing.</p></div>
<div class="indent1"><span class="nm">(b)</span><p><span class="cl">Answer:</span> No, the case is, they had Bi'ah.</p></div>
<div class="indent1"><span class="nm">(c)</span><p><span class="cl">Question:</span> If so, why doesn't Shmuel require a Get?</p></div>
<div class="indent1"><span class="nm">(d)</span><p><span class="cl">Answer:</span> He holds that when the husband has Bi'ah, he relies on the initial Kidushin (and does not intend to Mekadesh through Bi'ah).</p></div>
<div class="indent1"><span class="nm">(e)</span><p><span class="cl">Objection:</span> Rav and Shmuel already argued about this!</p></div>
<div class="indent2"><span class="nm">1.</span><p><span class="cl">(Rav):</span> If a man was Mekadesh a woman on condition, and did Nisu'in without mentioning the condition (and the condition was not fulfilled), she needs a Get.</p></div>
<div class="indent2"><span class="nm">2.</span><p><span class="cl">(Shmuel):</span> She does not need a Get.</p></div>
<div class="indent2"><span class="nm">3.</span><p>Rav requires a Get. Since he did Nisu'in, he pardoned his condition;</p></div>
<div class="indent2"><span class="nm">4.</span><p>Shmuel does not require a Get. When he has Bi'ah, he relies on the initial Kidushin.</p></div>
<div class="indent1"><span class="nm">(f)</span><p><span class="cl">Answer:</span> It was necessary for them to argue in both cases.</p></div>
<div class="indent2"><span class="nm">1.</span><p>Had they argued only about the condition, one might have thought that only there Rav holds that she is married, since he pardoned the condition, but regarding a minor who matured, he would agree with Shmuel;</p></div>
<div class="indent2"><span class="nm">2.</span><p>Had they argued only about a minor who matured, one might have thought that only there Shmuel holds that she is not married to the first husband, but regarding a condition, he would agree with Rav!</p></div>
<div class="indent1"><span class="nm">(g)</span><p><span class="cl">Question:</span> Did Rav really say that she is married only if they had Bi'ah?!</p></div>
<div class="indent2"><span class="nm">1.</span><p>A case occurred in which David was Mekadesh Leah (mid'Rabanan), she matured, and she was sitting by the Chupah. Levi grabbed her (and was Mekadesh her). Rav Beruna and Rav Chananel, Talmidim of Rav, were there, and they did not require her to get a Get from Levi.</p></div>
<div class="indent1"><span class="nm">(h)</span><p><span class="cl">Answer (Rav Ashi):</span> Since Levi acted improperly, Chachamim acted improperly to him (and uprooted his Kidushin).</p></div>
<div class="indent1"><span class="nm">(i)</span><p><span class="cl">Question (Ravina):</span> We understand this if he was Mekadesh her with money (Chachamim can transform the money to be a gift);</p></div>
<div class="indent2"><span class="nm">1.</span><p>If he was Mekadesh her through Bi'ah, how can Chachamim uproot his Kidushin?</p></div>
<div class="indent1"><span class="nm">(j)</span><p><span class="cl">Answer (Rav Ashi):</span> They make his Bi'ah an act of Bi'as Zenus.</p></div>
<div class="indent1"><span class="nm">(k)</span><p><span class="cl">(Rav Yehudah and R. Elazar):</span> The Halachah follows R. Eliezer.</p></div>
<div class="subject"><span class="nm">2)</span><p>TZAROS WHO ARE MARRIED MID'RABANAN</p></div>
<div class="indent1"><span class="nm">(a)</span><p><span class="cl">(Mishnah):</span> If a man was married to two orphaned minors and he died, Yibum or Chalitzah of one of them exempts the other. The same applies if he was married to two Chershos (deaf-mute women).</p></div>
<div class="indent1"><span class="nm">(b)</span><p>If he was married to an orphaned minor and a Chereshes, Yibum or Chalitzah of either does not exempt the other.</p></div>
<div class="indent1"><span class="nm">(c)</span><p>If he was married to a Pikachas (healthy woman) and a Chereshes, Yibum of the Pikachas exempts the Chereshes, but Yibum of the Chereshes does not exempt the Pikachas.</p></div>
<div class="indent1"><span class="nm">(d)</span><p>If he was married to an adult and an orphaned minor, Yibum of the adult exempts the minor, but Yibum of the minor does not exempt the adult.</p></div>
<div class="indent1"><span class="nm">(e)</span><p><span class="cl">(Gemara) Question:</span> A Chereshes cannot do Chalitzah!</p></div>
<div class="indent2"><span class="nm">1.</span><p><span class="cl">(Mishnah):</span> If the Yavam was deaf, or the Yevamah was deaf, or the Yavam was a minor and they did Chalitzah, it is invalid.</p></div>
<div class="indent1"><span class="nm">(f)</span><p><span class="cl">Answer #1 (Rav Gidal):</span> The Mishnah says 'and similarly' (regarding two Chershos) only regarding Yibum (Yibum of one exempts the other).</p></div>
<div class="indent1"><span class="nm">(g)</span><p><span class="cl">Answer #2 (Rabah):</span> It refers even to Chalitzah. We distinguish between a Chereshes from the start of marriage and a Pikachas who later became deaf.</p></div>
<div class="indent2"><span class="nm">1.</span><p>If she was deaf from the start of marriage, just like she married (mid'Rabanan) through gesturing, she leaves (Zikah through Chalitzah) through gesturing.</p></div>
<div class="indent2"><span class="nm">2.</span><p>If she was a Pikachas and later became Chereshes, she is married mid'Oraisa. She cannot do Chalitzah mid'Oraisa, because she cannot recite the verses.</p></div>
<div class="indent1"><span class="nm">(h)</span><p><span class="cl">Question (Abaye):</span> Also a Chereshes from the start of marriage cannot do Chalitzah!</p></div>
<div class="indent2"><span class="nm">1.</span><p><span class="cl">(Mishnah):</span> If a Cheresh was married to a Chereshes, and his Pike'ach brother was married to a Pikachas not related to the Chereshes, and the Cheresh died, his wife does Yibum. The Yavam may divorce her if he wants;</p></div>
<div class="indent2"><span class="nm">2.</span><p>If the Pike'ach died, the Yavam does Yibum, and he can never divorce her.</p></div>
<div class="indent3"><span class="nm">i.</span><p><span class="cl">Suggestion:</span> She was deaf from the start, and the Mishnah says that she can do only Yibum, but not Chalitzah!</p></div>
<div class="bbbline">110b----------------------------------------110b</p></div>
<div class="indent1"><span class="nm">(i)</span><p><span class="cl">Answer:</span> No. She was Pikachas and went deaf.</p></div>
<div class="indent1"><span class="nm">(j)</span><p><span class="cl">Question (Mishnah):</span> If two brothers Pikchim were married to two unrelated women, one Pikachas and one Chereshes, and the husband of the Chereshes died, the Yavam does Yibum. Later, he may divorce her if he wants.</p></div>
<div class="indent2"><span class="nm">1.</span><p>If the husband of the Pikachas died, the Yavam may do Chalitzah or Yibum.</p></div>
<div class="indent2"><span class="nm">2.</span><p><span class="cl">Suggestion:</span> Just like the Yavam was Pike'ach from the start, also the Yevamah was deaf from the start, and it says that she may do only Yibum, but not Chalitzah!</p></div>
<div class="indent1"><span class="nm">(k)</span><p><span class="cl">Answer:</span> No, each case is different. He was Pike'ach from the start, but she was Pikachas and went deaf.</p></div>
<div class="indent1"><span class="nm">(l)</span><p><span class="cl">Question (Mishnah):</span> If a Cheresh was married to a Chereshes, and his Pike'ach brother was married to her Pikachas sister, and the Cheresh died, his wife is exempt from Chalitzah and Yibum, due to Achos Ishto;</p></div>
<div class="indent2"><span class="nm">1.</span><p>If the Pike'ach died, the Cheresh must divorce his wife, and the Yevamah is forbidden forever (until the Yavam dies).</p></div>
<div class="indent2"><span class="nm">2.</span><p><span class="cl">Suggestion:</span> Here also the Yavam was Pike'ach and went deaf!</p></div>
<div class="indent2"><span class="nm">3.</span><p><span class="cl">Rejection:</span> If so, he could not divorce her!</p></div>
<div class="indent3"><span class="nm">i.</span><p><span class="cl">(Mishnah):</span> If she went deaf he may divorce her, but not if she went insane. If he went deaf or insane, he can never divorce her.</p></div>
<div class="indent2"><span class="nm">4.</span><p>Rather, he was deaf from the start.</p></div>
<div class="indent2"><span class="nm">5.</span><p><span class="cl">Suggestion:</span> Just like he was deaf from the start, so was the Yevamah. Since in the case of sisters they were deaf from the start, also in the case of the unrelated women;</p></div>
<div class="indent3"><span class="nm">i.</span><p>Regarding unrelated women, it says that she may do only Yibum, but not Chalitzah!</p></div>
<div class="indent1"><span class="nm">(m)</span><p>Rabah had no answer.</p></div>
<div class="indent1"><span class="nm">(n)</span><p><span class="cl">Rav Yosef (to Abaye):</span> Why did you ask from that case? Rabah could answer that the sisters were deaf from the start, but the unrelated women were Pikchos and went deaf! You should have asked from the following case!</p></div>
<div class="indent2"><span class="nm">1.</span><p><span class="cl">(Mishnah):</span> If two brothers were married to two sisters, and both men or both women (including when three or all four of them) were deaf, and one man died, his wife is exempt from Chalitzah and Yibum;</p></div>
<div class="indent2"><span class="nm">2.</span><p>If the wives were unrelated, the Yavam may do Yibum. Afterwards, if he wants he may divorce her.</p></div>
<div class="indent2"><span class="nm">3.</span><p><span class="cl">Question:</span> What is the case?</p></div>
<div class="indent2"><span class="nm">4.</span><p><span class="cl">Suggestion:</span> The men were Pikchim and later went deaf.</p></div>
<div class="indent2"><span class="nm">5.</span><p><span class="cl">Rejection:</span> If so, they could not divorce!</p></div>
<div class="indent3"><span class="nm">i.</span><p><span class="cl">(Mishnah):</span> If she went insane, he may not divorce her. If he went deaf or insane, he can never divorce her.</p></div>
<div class="indent2"><span class="nm">6.</span><p><span class="cl">Answer:</span> Rather, the men were deaf from the start. Since they were deaf from the start, so were the women, and it says that the Yavam may do Yibum but not Chalitzah!</p></div>
<div class="indent1"><span class="nm">(o)</span><p>Rabah is refuted.</p></div>
<div class="subject"><span class="nm">3)</span><p>ONE WHO IS MARRIED TO A CHERESHES AND A MINOR</p></div>
<div class="indent1"><span class="nm">(a)</span><p><span class="cl">(Mishnah):</span> If an (orphaned) minor and a Chereshes (were Tzaros, Yibum or Chalitzah of either does not exempt the other).</p></div>
<div class="indent1"><span class="nm">(b)</span><p><span class="cl">(Rav Ada bar Ahavah and Rav Chana):</span> This is only if their husband was Pike'ach, and we do not know which wife he preferred.</p></div>
<div class="indent2"><span class="nm">1.</span><p>Perhaps he preferred the minor, because she will (mature and) have understanding;</p></div>
<div class="indent2"><span class="nm">2.</span><p>Perhaps he preferred the Chereshes, because she is an adult and is (more) fit for Bi'ah;</p></div>
<div class="indent2"><span class="nm">3.</span><p>However, if he was deaf, surely he preferred the Chereshes, because she was fit for Bi'ah and was like him!</p></div>
<div class="indent1"><span class="nm">(c)</span><p><span class="cl">(Rav Nachman):</span> Even if their husband was deaf, the Tana is unsure.</p></div>
<div class="indent1"><span class="nm">(d)</span><p><span class="cl">Question:</span> What is the solution? (A Chereshes cannot do Chalitzah. Chalitzah with the minor (after she matures) would forbid the Chereshes to him.)</p></div>
<div class="indent1"><span class="nm">(e)</span><p><span class="cl">Answer (Rav Chisda citing Rav):</span> He does Yibum with the Chereshes, then divorces her. The minor does Chalitzah when she grows up.</p></div>
<div class="indent1"><span class="nm">(f)</span><p><span class="cl">(Rav Chisda):</span> Rav holds that a Chereshes is partially married, and a minor is married and not married (i.e. Safek married. We cannot say that both of them are partially married, for then Bi'ah of one would exempt the other. We cannot say that both are Safek, for then if both did Bi'ah, the latter would not forbid the former.)</p></div>
<div class="indent1"><span class="nm">(g)</span><p><span class="cl">Question:</span> Perhaps a minor is partially married, and a Chereshes is Safek!</p></div>
<div class="indent1"><span class="nm">(h)</span><p><span class="cl">Answer:</span> If so, he would not need to divorce the Chereshes after Yibum. In any case, he could remain married to her!</p></div>
<div class="indent2"><span class="nm">1.</span><p>If a Chereshes is married, the Yibum is valid, so he may keep her;</p></div>
<div class="indent2"><span class="nm">2.</span><p>If a Chereshes is not married, she is like a stranger (i.e. not a Yevamah) who married the Yavam, so she may remain with him!</p></div>
