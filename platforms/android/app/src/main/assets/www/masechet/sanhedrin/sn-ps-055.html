<p class="bas subject"><span class="nm">1)</span>UNNATURAL OR INCOMPLETE BI'AH</p>
<p class="bas indent1"><span class="nm">(a)</span><span class="cl">Support (for Rav - Beraisa):</span> The following are liable: (one who is Shochev with) a boy (above) nine years, or a man or woman who has Bi'ah with an animal, normally or abnormally. (This is based on Rashi DH Tanya and DH ha'Ba. The Ya'avetz explains that it discusses only bestiality.)</p>
<p class="bas indent1"><span class="nm">(b)</span><span class="cl">Version #1 (Rashi) (Rav Nachman bar Rav Chisda):</span> Bestiality applies to either opening of a woman (we learn from "Mishkevei Ishah"), but it applies only to normal Shechivah of a man with an animal.</p>
<p class="bas indent1"><span class="nm">(c)</span><span class="cl">Question (Rav Papa):</span> Just the contrary! It is normal for a woman to have normal Bi'ah (with a man), so only this is Bi'ah (even with an animal), but all Shechivah with an animal is abnormal, so one is liable for either kind!</p>
<p class="bas indent1"><span class="nm">(d)</span><span class="cl">Rejection (of both of them - Beraisa):</span> The following are liable: (one who is Shochev with) a boy (above) nine years, or a man or woman who has Bi'ah with an animal, normally or abnormally.</p>
<p class="bas indent1"><span class="nm">(e)</span><span class="cl">Version #2 (Tosfos) (Rav Nachman bar Rav Chisda):</span> Both kinds of Bi'ah (of a man) with a woman are considered Bi'ah, but only normal Shechivah with an animal is bestiality.</p>
<p class="bas indent1"><span class="nm">(f)</span><span class="cl">Question (Rav Papa):</span> It would be more reasonable to say the contrary! It is normal for a woman to have Bi'ah, so only normal Bi'ah with her is Bi'ah, but all bestiality is abnormal, so one is liable for either kind! (Tosfos - Rav Papa agrees that one is liable for either Bi'ah with a woman. He just teaches that if one would distinguish, we would exempt abnormal Bi'ah with a woman.)</p>
<p class="bas indent1"><span class="nm">(g)</span><span class="cl">Rejection (of Rav Nachman bar Rav Chisda - Beraisa):</span> If a nine-year old boy, or a woman commits bestiality, naturally or unnaturally, he or she is liable. (end of Version #2)</p>
<p class="bas indent1"><span class="nm">(h)</span><span class="cl">Question (Ravina):</span> If a man does Ha'ara'ah (the first stage of Bi'ah. Some say that it is initial penetration, and some say that it is touching the gentials) with a man, what is the law?</p>
<p class="bas indent1"><span class="nm">(i)</span><span class="cl">Objection:</span> This is obvious! Regarding Mishkav Zachar it says "Mishkevei Ishah." Since Ha'ara'ah with a woman is like full Bi'ah, also with a man!</p>
<p class="bas indent1"><span class="nm">(j)</span><span class="cl">Correction:</span> Rather, if a man does Ha'ara'ah with an animal, what is the law?</p>
<p class="bas indent1"><span class="nm">(k)</span><span class="cl">Answer (Rava):</span> The Torah says "Ha'ara'ah" regarding Bi'ah with a paternal or maternal aunt;</p>
<p class="bas indent2"><span class="nm">1.</span>Since we do not need this to teach about aunts (we already know that Ha'ara'ah with Arayos is like full Bi'ah, for they are equated to Nidah, regarding which it says Ha'ara'ah), we use it to teach about Ha'ara'ah with an animal.</p>
<p class="bas indent1"><span class="nm">(l)</span><span class="cl">Question:</span> One is Chayav Misah for bestiality. Why did the Torah write Ha'ara'ah regarding Chayavei Kerisus (aunts)? It should have written it by something else that is Chayav Misah!</p>
<p class="bas indent1"><span class="nm">(m)</span><span class="cl">Answer:</span> It wrote it regarding aunts, for the entire verse is extra to be expounded. (Other verses already forbid aunts.)</p>
<p class="bas indent1"><span class="nm">(n)</span><span class="cl">Question (Rav Achdeboy bar Ami):</span> If one did Ha'ara'ah to himself, what is the law?</p>
<p class="bas indent1"><span class="nm">(o)</span><span class="cl">Rav Sheshes:</span> Do not bother me with questions about impossible things!</p>
<p class="bas indent1"><span class="nm">(p)</span><span class="cl">Rav Ashi:</span> Granted, it is impossible when the Ever is Chai (in erection), but it is possible when it is Mes!</p>
<p class="bas indent2"><span class="nm">1.</span>According to the opinion that Bi'ah with an Ever Mes is exempt, he is exempt. According to the opinion that Bi'ah with an Ever Mes is liable, he is liable twice, like a Shochev and a Nishkav.</p>
<p class="bas subject"><span class="nm">2)</span>WHEN DO WE KILL THE ANIMAL?</p>
<p class="bas indent1"><span class="nm">(a)</span><span class="cl">Question:</span> If a Nochri had Bi'ah with an animal, do we kill it?</p>
<p class="bas indent2"><span class="nm">1.</span>If an animal is killed (when a Yisrael had Bi'ah with it) due to Takalah (a great transgression came about through it) <i>and</i> disgrace (people will remember his sin when they see the animal), here there is only Takalah, there is not disgrace (Nochrim often do this), we do not kill it;</p>
<p class="bas indent2"><span class="nm">2.</span>If an animal is killed due to Takalah alone, we kill it.</p>
<p class="bas indent1"><span class="nm">(b)</span><span class="cl">Answer (Rav Sheshes - Beraisa):</span> Trees do not eat, drink or smell, yet we destroy an Asheirah because a Takalah resulted from it. If an enticer veers someone from the path of life (Mitzvos) to the path of death, and all the more so the enticer should be destroyed!</p>
<p class="bas indent1"><span class="nm">(c)</span><span class="cl">Question:</span> If so (it depends only on Takalah), if a Nochri bowed to an animal, it should become forbidden and we should kill it!</p>
<p class="bas indent1"><span class="nm">(d)</span><span class="cl">Answer:</span> We never find something permitted to a Yisrael (if a Yisrael bowed to an animal, it is invalid for a Korban, but he may eat it or benefit from it) and forbidden to a Nochri!</p>
<p class="bas indent1"><span class="nm">(e)</span><span class="cl">Question:</span> If a Yisrael bowed to it, it should be forbidden, just like an animal that a Yisrael slept with!</p>
<p class="bas indent1"><span class="nm">(f)</span><span class="cl">Answer #1 (Abaye):</span> Bestiality is a greater disgrace than idolatry.</p>
<p class="bas indent2"><span class="nm">1.</span><span class="cl">Question:</span> We destroy Asheiros, even though the disgrace is not so great!</p>
<p class="bas indent2"><span class="nm">2.</span><span class="cl">Answer:</span> The Torah is more concerned for animals than for trees.</p>
<p class="bas indent1"><span class="nm">(g)</span><span class="cl">Answer #2 (Rava):</span> Because the animal enjoyed the transgression, it is killed.</p>
<p class="bas indent2"><span class="nm">1.</span><span class="cl">Question:</span> We destroy Asheiros, even though they did not enjoy the transgression!</p>
<p class="bas indent2"><span class="nm">2.</span><span class="cl">Answer:</span> The Torah is more concerned for animals than for trees.</p>
<p class="bas indent1"><span class="nm">(h)</span><span class="cl">Support (for Rav Sheshes - Mishnah):</span> Also, (the animal is killed because) the Torah does not want that people will see the animal and mention that Ploni was stoned due to it.</p>
<p class="bas bbbline">55b----------------------------------------55b</p>
<p class="bas indent2"><span class="nm">1.</span><span class="cl">Suggestion:</span> This second answer mentions both Takalah and disgrace. This implies that the first answer (because the animal was a Takalah for a person), is enough to stone it (if not, the first answer could have been omitted)!</p>
<p class="bas indent2"><span class="nm">2.</span>The first answer refers to a Nochri that committed bestiality (there is only Takalah), the second refers to a Yisrael that committed bestiality.</p>
<p class="bas indent1"><span class="nm">(i)</span><span class="cl">Rejection:</span> No, we kill it only when there is disgrace;</p>
<p class="bas indent2"><span class="nm">1.</span>This second answer mentions both Takalah and disgrace. The first answer is when there is only disgrace.</p>
<p class="bas indent2"><span class="nm">2.</span><span class="cl">Question:</span> When is there only disgrace?</p>
<p class="bas indent2"><span class="nm">3.</span><span class="cl">Answer:</span> A Yisrael committed bestiality b'Shogeg.</p>
<p class="bas indent1"><span class="nm">(j)</span>Rav Hamnuna was unsure about this.</p>

<p class="bas indent2"><span class="nm">2.</span>If we kill an animal when there is only disgrace, we kill it.</p>
<p class="bas indent1"><span class="nm">(l)</span><span class="cl">Answer #1 (Rav Yosef - Mishnah):</span> A three year-old girl can become Mekudeshes through Bi'ah;</p>
<p class="bas indent2"><span class="nm">1.</span>If she fell to Yibum and did Yibum, it takes effect (she is married to the Yavam);</p>
<p class="bas indent2"><span class="nm">2.</span>Anyone (except her husband) is liable for (Bi'ah with) a married woman,</p>
<p class="bas indent2"><span class="nm">3.</span>One who has Bi'ah with her (when she is Nidah becomes Tamei like a Nidah. He) is Metamei a mattress under him (even if other mattresses are in between) like a Keli above (and touching a Zav);</p>

<p class="bas indent2"><span class="nm">7.</span><span class="cl">Suggestion:</span> 'Any of the Arayos' includes an animal. It is killed, even though there is only disgrace, and not Takalah!</p>
<p class="bas indent1"><span class="nm">(m)</span><span class="cl">Rejection:</span> Since she was Mezidah, there is also Takalah. The Torah had mercy on her (since she is a minor) and does not kill her;</p>
<p class="bas indent2"><span class="nm">1.</span>The Torah had mercy on her, but not on the animal.</p>
<p class="bas indent1"><span class="nm">(n)</span><span class="cl">Answer #2 (Rava - Mishnah):</span> If a nine-year old boy did Yibum, it takes effect. He cannot divorce her until he becomes an adult;</p>

<p class="bas indent2"><span class="nm">1.</span><span class="cl">Suggestion:</span> Since the Seifa mentions both disgrace and Takalah, the Reisha (the animal led to the downfall of a person) must come to include disgrace without Takalah, i.e. a Yisrael who had Bi'ah with an animal b'Shogeg!</p>
