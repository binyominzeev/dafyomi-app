<div class="subject"><span class="nm">1)</span><p>SHECHITAH ON SHABBOS</p></div>
<div class="indent1"><span class="nm">(a)</span><p><span class="cl">(Mishnah):</span> If one slaughters on Shabbos or Yom Kipur, even though he is Chayav Misah, the Shechitah is Kosher.</p></div>
<div class="indent1"><span class="nm">(b)</span><p><span class="cl">(Gemara - Rav):</span> The meat may not be eaten that same day.</p></div>
<div class="indent1"><span class="nm">(c)</span><p><span class="cl">(Rabanan):</span> (He holds that) the Mishnah is like R. Yehudah.</p></div>
<div class="indent1"><span class="nm">(d)</span><p><span class="cl">Question:</span> Like which teaching of R. Yehudah is the Mishnah?</p></div>
<div class="indent1"><span class="nm">(e)</span><p><span class="cl">Answer #1 (R. Aba):</span> It is like his teaching that food for Shabbos must be prepared before Shabbos.</p></div>
<div class="indent2"><span class="nm">1.</span><p><span class="cl">(Mishnah):</span> We may cut gourds in front of animals, and a carcass in front of dogs (on Shabbos);</p></div>
<div class="indent2"><span class="nm">2.</span><p>R. Yehudah says, if the animal was not dead when Shabbos began, we may not cut the carcass, since it was not prepared.</p></div>
<div class="indent3"><span class="nm">i.</span><p>Since it was not prepared from before Shabbos, it is forbidden. Also in our Mishnah, the animal was not prepared.</p></div>
<div class="indent1"><span class="nm">(f)</span><p><span class="cl">Question (Abaye):</span> The cases are different!</p></div>
<div class="indent2"><span class="nm">1.</span><p>In that Mishnah, when Shabbos began, the animal was destined for people (to eat). After it died, it became destined for animal consumption;</p></div>
<div class="indent2"><span class="nm">2.</span><p>In our Mishnah, the animal was destined for people when Shabbos began, and also after it was slaughtered!</p></div>
<div class="indent1"><span class="nm">(g)</span><p><span class="cl">Answer (R. Aba):</span> A live animal is not destined for people, rather to have offspring!</p></div>
<div class="indent1"><span class="nm">(h)</span><p><span class="cl">Question (Abaye):</span> If so, why does R. Yehudah permit slaughtering animals on Yom Tov?</p></div>
<div class="indent1"><span class="nm">(i)</span><p><span class="cl">Correction (R. Aba):</span> A live animal is destined for people or to have offspring.</p></div>
<div class="indent2"><span class="nm">1.</span><p>If it is slaughtered, this clarifies that is was destined for people. If it is not slaughtered, this shows that it was destined to have offspring.</p></div>
<div class="indent1"><span class="nm">(j)</span><p><span class="cl">Question:</span> R. Yehudah does not rely on Breirah (to say that that later events can retroactively clarify things)!</p></div>
<div class="indent2"><span class="nm">1.</span><p><span class="cl">Question:</span> What is the source that R. Yehudah does not rely on Breirah?</p></div>
<div class="indent2"><span class="nm">2.</span><p><span class="cl">Suggestion:</span> We learn from the following Beraisa.</p></div>
<div class="indent3"><span class="nm">i.</span><p><span class="cl">(Beraisa - R. Meir):</span> If one buys (100 Lugim of) wine from Kusim (and cannot separate Ma'aseros before drinking) he says 'the two Lugim that I will later separate (to be Terumah) are Terumah. The 10 Lugim (that I will separate) are Ma'aser Rishon. The nine Lugim are Ma'aser Sheni.' He (Rashi - redeems the Ma'aser Sheni and) may drink immediately;</p></div>
<div class="indent3"><span class="nm">ii.</span><p>R. Yehudah, R. Yosi and R. Shimon say, he must separate the Ma'aseros before drinking.</p></div>
<div class="bbbline">14b----------------------------------------14b</p></div>
<div class="indent2"><span class="nm">3.</span><p><span class="cl">Rejection:</span> Normally, R. Yehudah relies on Breirah. There, he does not rely on Breirah for a reason;</p></div>
<div class="indent3"><span class="nm">i.</span><p><span class="cl">(Beraisa - R. Yehudah, R. Yosi and R. Shimon, to R. Meir):</span> Aren't you concerned lest the barrel break (and he will never separate the Ma'aseros)?</p></div>
<div class="indent3"><span class="nm">ii.</span><p><span class="cl">R. Meir:</span> Until it breaks, we are not concerned.</p></div>
<div class="indent2"><span class="nm">4.</span><p><span class="cl">Answer (to Question 1):</span> Rather, we learn from the following Beraisa.</p></div>
<div class="indent3"><span class="nm">i.</span><p><span class="cl">(Beraisa - Ayo):</span> R. Yehudah says, one cannot make Eruvim in two places on condition (i.e. if a Chacham comes in the west, and another in the east, I will decide which Eruv should be valid);</p></div>
<div class="indent3"><span class="nm">ii.</span><p>He can say 'if a Chacham comes in the west, my Eruv is in the west. If he comes in the east, my Eruv is in the east.'</p></div>
<div class="indent3"><span class="nm">iii.</span><p><span class="cl">Objection:</span> He cannot make Eruvim in two places on condition because we do not rely on Breirah. For the same reason, also the latter case (when one Chacham comes) should not work!</p></div>
<div class="indent3"><span class="nm">iv.</span><p><span class="cl">Answer (R. Yochanan):</span> The case is, the Chachamim already came (before he stipulated. Since it is already determined which Eruv is valid (even though the one making the Eruv does not know which), this does not require Breirah.</p></div>
<div class="subject"><span class="nm">2)</span><p>THE MEAT IS NOLAD</p></div>
<div class="indent1"><span class="nm">(a)</span><p><span class="cl">Answer #2 (to question 1:d - Rav Yosef):</span> The Mishnah is like R. Yehudah's teaching regarding Kelim.</p></div>
<div class="indent2"><span class="nm">1.</span><p><span class="cl">(Mishnah):</span> If a Kli may be moved on Shabbos, and a piece broke off, the piece may be moved only if it has a use;</p></div>
<div class="indent3"><span class="nm">i.</span><p>For example, a piece of a kneading trough may be used to cover a barrel. A piece of glass may be used to cover a flask.</p></div>
<div class="indent2"><span class="nm">2.</span><p>R. Yehudah says, the piece must have a use similar to its original usage;</p></div>
<div class="indent3"><span class="nm">i.</span><p>For example, if a piece of a kneading trough can hold porridge, or a piece of glass can hold oil, they may be moved;</p></div>
<div class="indent3"><span class="nm">ii.</span><p>If they are fitting only for unrelated uses, since they were not prepared for the new task when Shabbos began, they are Nolad. They may not be moved.</p></div>
<div class="indent2"><span class="nm">3.</span><p><span class="cl">(Culmination of answer):</span> The same applies to an animal slaughtered on Shabbos (it was not fit to be eaten when Shabbos began, it is Nolad)!</p></div>
<div class="indent1"><span class="nm">(b)</span><p><span class="cl">Objection (Abaye):</span> The cases are different! There, it was a Kli and now it is a fragment. Here, it was a food, and still it is a food. R. Yehudah permits this (Rashba - even when there is no permitted way to cause the change);</p></div>
<div class="indent2"><span class="nm">1.</span><p><span class="cl">(Mishnah):</span> We may not squeeze fruit on Shabbos to extract the juice. If the juice came out by b</p></div>
<div class="indent2"><span class="nm">2.</span><p>R. Yehudah says, if the owner planned to eat the fruit, what flows from it is permitted. If he planned to extract the juice, what flows from it is forbidden.</p></div>
<div class="indent1"><span class="nm">(c)</span><p><span class="cl">Answer:</span> Shmuel taught that R. Yehudah admits regarding olives and grapes. (What flows from them is forbidden, even if he planned to eat them.)</p></div>
<div class="indent2"><span class="nm">1.</span><p>Because people normally squeeze them, he is happy that liquid flows from them. (If we permit the juice,) he may come to squeeze them (on Shabbos);</p></div>
<div class="indent2"><span class="nm">2.</span><p>Similarly, one plans to slaughter an animal. We should forbid the meat if it is slaughtered, lest he come to slaughter!</p></div>
<div class="indent1"><span class="nm">(d)</span><p><span class="cl">Rejection:</span> Rav Yosef answered how Rav understands the Mishnah like R. Yehudah. Rav holds that R. Yehudah argues even regarding olives and grapes!</p></div>
<div class="subject"><span class="nm">3)</span><p>MUKTZAH DUE TO A PROHIBITION</p></div>
<div class="indent1"><span class="nm">(a)</span><p><span class="cl">Answer #3 (to question 1:d - Rav Sheshes brei d'Rav Idi):</span> The Mishnah is like R. Yehudah's opinion regarding lamps.</p></div>
<div class="indent2"><span class="nm">1.</span><p><span class="cl">(Beraisa - R. Yehudah):</span> On Shabbos, we may move a new lamp (one that has not yet been used), but not a used lamp.</p></div>
<div class="indent1"><span class="nm">(b)</span><p><span class="cl">Objection:</span> This shows that R. Yehudah forbids something that is Muktzah because one is disgusted by it (a used earthenware lamp). We have no source that he forbids something Muktzah (even when it has a permitted use) because it was forbidden to move it when Shabbos began!</p></div>
<div class="indent1"><span class="nm">(c)</span><p><span class="cl">Answer:</span> We do have a source!</p></div>
<div class="indent2"><span class="nm">1.</span><p><span class="cl">(Mishnah - R. Yehudah):</span> We may move any metal lamp (even a used lamp), except one that was lit when Shabbos began.</p></div>
<div class="indent1"><span class="nm">(d)</span><p><span class="cl">Rejection:</span> There, he lit the lamp before Shabbos began. His actions prove that he does not intend to move it. We cannot learn to an animal that was slaughtered, for (before Shabbos) he did nothing to forbid the animal!</p></div>
