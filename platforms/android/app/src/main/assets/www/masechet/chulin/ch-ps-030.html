<div class="subject"><span class="nm">1)</span><p>CHANGING THE STATUS OF A KORBAN</p></div>
<div class="indent1"><span class="nm">(a)</span><p><span class="cl">Objection (Abaye):</span> Rava's question remains, for R. Yochanan taught that this Stam (anonymous) Beraisa is the opinion of R. Elazar b'Rebbi Shimon, but Chachamim permit two to slaughter one Korban!</p></div>
<div class="indent2"><span class="nm">1.</span><p>Even according to R. Elazar, we may distinguish in the case of a valid Parah, if the Shochet wore one hat at the start of Shechitah, and a different hat at the end of Shechitah (only the latter should become Tamei)!</p></div>
<div class="indent1"><span class="nm">(b)</span><p><span class="cl">Answer #2 (Abaye):</span> We must say that the Mishnah teaches only cases when the Parah is disqualified.</p></div>
<div class="indent1"><span class="nm">(c)</span><p><span class="cl">Question (Rav Idi bar Avin - Mishnah):</span> If a Korban Pesach (was not offered on Erev Pesach, rather,) was slaughtered during Pesach by someone who had Chametz:</p></div>
<div class="indent2"><span class="nm">1.</span><p>If he slaughtered it l'Shem (to be) Korban Pesach (it is invalid, so) he is exempt for slaughtering it while owning Chametz;</p></div>
<div class="indent2"><span class="nm">2.</span><p>If he slaughtered it l'Shem a different Korban (it is valid, so) he is liable.</p></div>
<div class="indent2"><span class="nm">3.</span><p><span class="cl">Version #1 - Rashi - Question (Inference):</span> He is liable only because he intended for a different Korban. Without special intent, he would be exempt!</p></div>
<div class="indent3"><span class="nm">i.</span><p>Since it was not offered on Erev Pesach, the Korban is destined to be a Shelamim. Without special intent, it should be a valid Shelamim, and he should be liable!</p></div>
<div class="indent2"><span class="nm">4.</span><p><span class="cl">Version #2 - Tosfos - Question:</span> Since it was not offered on Erev Pesach, the Korban is destined to be a Shelamim. Even if he intended l'Shem Pesach, it should be valid (like a Shelamim), and he should be liable! (end of Version #2)</p></div>
<div class="indent2"><span class="nm">5.</span><p><span class="cl">Answer:</span> We must say that it does not become a Shelamim automatically. One must change its status from a Pesach to make it a Shelamim.</p></div>
<div class="indent2"><span class="nm">6.</span><p><span class="cl">Rejection (R. Chiya bar Gamda):</span> No. The case is, the owners were Teme'im on Erev Pesach, so the Korban is destined to be offered l'Shem Pesach on Pesach Sheni.</p></div>
<div class="indent3"><span class="nm">i.</span><p>Only in this case, its status must be changed to make it a Shelamim. However, if the owners (were Tehorim and) brought a different Korban on Erev Pesach, and this will not be used for a Pesach, it is automatically a Shelamim.</p></div>
<div class="indent2"><span class="nm">7.</span><p><span class="cl">(Culmination of Rav Idi's question):</span> The Mishnah is reasonable if the entire Shechitah is considered Shechitah. The Korban became Pasul at the beginning of the Shechitah (it is a Pesach at the wrong time), so he is exempt.</p></div>
<div class="indent3"><span class="nm">i.</span><p>However, if only the end is considered Shechitah, at the start of Shechitah (i.e. after cutting more than half the Kaneh, or any amount of the Veshet), it became unusable for Pesach (Sheni, since it will not live until then). It becomes a Shelamim. He should be liable for Shechitah of a Shelamim (while owning Chametz during Pesach)!</p></div>
<div class="indent1"><span class="nm">(d)</span><p><span class="cl">Answer (Abaye):</span> Granted, once he started Shechitah, it became unusable for Pesach Sheni. However, it was destined to be redeemed, and to use the redemption money to buy another Pesach. (Therefore, it does not automatically become a Shelamim.)</p></div>
<div class="indent1"><span class="nm">(e)</span><p><span class="cl">Question:</span> We can redeem an animal only if it can stand up for appraisal!</p></div>
<div class="indent1"><span class="nm">(f)</span><p><span class="cl">Answer:</span> It can be redeemed!</p></div>
<div class="indent2"><span class="nm">1.</span><p>We learned that if both Simanim or their majority was slaughtered, and the animal is still quivering, it is considered alive in every way. (I.e. it can be appraised. Tosfos - this is derived from a Mishnah (117b).)</p></div>
<div class="subject"><span class="nm">2)</span><p>INTERMITTENT SHECHITAH</p></div>
<div class="indent1"><span class="nm">(a)</span><p><span class="cl">(Rav):</span> If one slaughters in two or three places, this is valid.</p></div>
<div class="indent1"><span class="nm">(b)</span><p><span class="cl">(Shmuel and Reish Lakish):</span> This is invalid. Shechitah must be exposed.</p></div>
<div class="indent1"><span class="nm">(c)</span><p><span class="cl">Question (R. Elazar - Mishnah):</span> If two people are holding knives and slaughter, even one above and one below, this is valid.</p></div>
<div class="indent2"><span class="nm">1.</span><p>Such a Shechitah is not exposed, yet it is valid!</p></div>
<div class="indent1"><span class="nm">(d)</span><p><span class="cl">Answer (R. Yirmeyah):</span> It means that if two are holding a knife, even they hold it on opposite ends, the Shechitah is Kosher.</p></div>
<div class="indent1"><span class="nm">(e)</span><p><span class="cl">Question (R. Aba - Beraisa):</span> We are not concerned lest they make it a Treifah.</p></div>
<div class="indent2"><span class="nm">1.</span><p>Granted, if each cuts with his own knife, one might have thought that each will rely on the other to cut the majority of the Siman (and neither will cut the majority).</p></div>
<div class="indent2"><span class="nm">2.</span><p>However, if they cut with one knife, the concern is not lest they make it a Treifah, rather, Derasah (they will press on the knife)!</p></div>
<div class="indent1"><span class="nm">(f)</span><p><span class="cl">Answer (R. Avin):</span> Indeed, the Beraisa should say 'we are not concerned for Derasah.'</p></div>
<div class="bbbline">30b----------------------------------------30b</p></div>
<div class="indent1"><span class="nm">(g)</span><p><span class="cl">Question (R. Avin - Beraisa):</span> If he slaughtered the Veshet below and the Kaneh above or vice-versa, this is Kosher.</p></div>
<div class="indent2"><span class="nm">1.</span><p>Such a Shechitah is not exposed!</p></div>
<div class="indent1"><span class="nm">(h)</span><p><span class="cl">Answer (R. Avin):</span> He slaughtered on a slant. It is exposed.</p></div>
<div class="indent1"><span class="nm">(i)</span><p>An ox was slaughtered in two or three places. R. Yitzchak bar Shmuel took from the choice parts to eat.</p></div>
<div class="indent1"><span class="nm">(j)</span><p><span class="cl">Version #1 - Rashi (R. Zeira):</span> We learn from you that the Mishnah permits Shechitah done by two people, each holding his own knife.</p></div>
<div class="indent1"><span class="nm">(k)</span><p><span class="cl">Version #2 - Tosfos - Question (R. Zeira):</span> Didn't you teach us that when the Mishnah permits Shechitah done by two people, this is when they are holding one knife?!</p></div>
<div class="subject"><span class="nm">3)</span><p>CHALADAH</p></div>
<div class="indent1"><span class="nm">(a)</span><p><span class="cl">(Rav Yehudah):</span> Chaladah (Shechitah when the knife is covered) between the Simanim is invalid. If he cut when the knife was under the skin, this is Kosher.</p></div>
<div class="indent1"><span class="nm">(b)</span><p><span class="cl">Question:</span> We already learned the first law in a Mishnah!</p></div>
<div class="indent2"><span class="nm">1.</span><p><span class="cl">(Mishnah - R. Yeshevav):</span> If he Hichlid the knife under the second Siman and cut it, the animal is a Neveilah;</p></div>
<div class="indent2"><span class="nm">2.</span><p>R. Akiva says, it is a Treifah.</p></div>
<div class="indent1"><span class="nm">(c)</span><p><span class="cl">Answer:</span> One might have thought that the Mishnah applies only when he cut (the second Siman) from the back of the neck towards the front; but when he cuts from the front towards the back, it is Kosher. Rav Yehudah teaches that this is not so.</p></div>
<div class="indent1"><span class="nm">(d)</span><p><span class="cl">(Rav Yehudah):</span> If he cut when the knife was under the skin, this is Kosher.</p></div>
<div class="indent1"><span class="nm">(e)</span><p><span class="cl">(Bei Rav):</span> I do not know what the law is in this case.</p></div>
<div class="indent1"><span class="nm">(f)</span><p><span class="cl">Question:</span> What would Bei Rav say if the knife was under a cloth, or covered by the animal's wool?</p></div>
<div class="indent2"><span class="nm">1.</span><p>This question is unresolved.</p></div>
<div class="indent1"><span class="nm">(g)</span><p><span class="cl">Question (Rav Papa):</span> What is the law if he cut the minority of the Simanim (Rashi - the remaining minority, after cutting the majority; Tosfos - the beginning of the Shechitah) when the knife was covered?</p></div>
<div class="indent2"><span class="nm">1.</span><p>This question is unresolved.</p></div>
<div class="subject"><span class="nm">4)</span><p>DERASAH</p></div>
<div class="indent1"><span class="nm">(a)</span><p><span class="cl">(Mishnah):</span> If one slaughters two heads at once, they are Kosher;</p></div>
<div class="indent1"><span class="nm">(b)</span><p>If two people are holding a knife, even if one (holds) above and the other below, their Shechitah is Kosher.</p></div>
<div class="indent1"><span class="nm">(c)</span><p>If one chops off the head at once, this is invalid;</p></div>
<div class="indent1"><span class="nm">(d)</span><p>If he slaughtered and chopped off the head, if the knife is as long as the neck, this is Kosher;</p></div>
<div class="indent1"><span class="nm">(e)</span><p>If he slaughtered and chopped off the heads of two animals, if the knife is as long as one neck, this is Kosher.</p></div>
<div class="indent2"><span class="nm">1.</span><p>This is when he cut in only one direction, either moving the knife away from himself or drawing it towards himself. If he cut in both directions, no matter how small the knife is, even a tiny razor, the Shechitah is valid.</p></div>
<div class="indent1"><span class="nm">(f)</span><p><span class="cl">(Gemara) Question:</span> What is the source (that one must slide the knife, not chop)?</p></div>
<div class="indent1"><span class="nm">(g)</span><p><span class="cl">Answer #1 (Shmuel):</span> "An arrow Shachat" (teaches that Shechitah is drawn, like an arrow).</p></div>
<div class="indent1"><span class="nm">(h)</span><p><span class="cl">Answer #2 (Tana d'Vei R. Yishmael):</span> "V'Shachat" is an expression of drawing -"Gold Shachat" (Shechitah is drawn, like gold).</p></div>
<div class="indent2"><span class="nm">1.</span><p>Also, it says "an arrow Shachat".</p></div>
<div class="indent1"><span class="nm">(i)</span><p><span class="cl">Question:</span> Why is the second verse needed?</p></div>
<div class="indent1"><span class="nm">(j)</span><p><span class="cl">Answer:</span> One might have thought that the first verse discusses gold spun like a thread.</p></div>
