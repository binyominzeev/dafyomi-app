<p class="bas subject"><span class="nm">1)</span>WHY IS A WIFE'S DAUGHTER-IN-LAW PERMITTED?</p>
<p class="bas indent1"><span class="nm">(a)</span><span class="cl">Question:</span> Since we equate his She'er with his wife's, her daughter-in-law should be forbidden!</p>
<p class="bas indent1"><span class="nm">(b)</span><span class="cl">Answer #1 (Abaye):</span> "Eshes Bincha Hi" - he is liable for his daughter-in-law, but not for her daughter-in-law.</p>
<p class="bas indent1"><span class="nm">(c)</span><span class="cl">Answer #2 (Rava):</span> We cannot learn her daughter-in-law from his, whether we say Dun Minah u'Minah, or Dun Minah v'Uki b'Asra;</p>
<p class="bas indent2"><span class="nm">1.</span>If we say Dun Minah u'Minah, and we want to learn that her daughter-in-law is forbidden, the punishment must be stoning, just like for his;</p>
<p class="bas indent3"><span class="nm">i.</span>According to Chachamim, stoning is more stringent. We cannot learn her She'er from his, because the Torah is more stringent about his mother (stoning) than hers (burning);</p>
<p class="bas indent3"><span class="nm">ii.</span>Also, her own daughter is punishable by burning. Her daughter-in-law cannot be more stringent (stoning)!</p>
<p class="bas indent3"><span class="nm">iii.</span><span class="cl">Rejection:</span> This last objection is invalid. We find that his own daughter-in-law (stoning) is more stringent than his own daughter!</p>
<p class="bas indent3"><span class="nm">iv.</span>Rather, we have another objection. Just like we do not distinguish between his mother and daughter-in-law (both are stoned), we cannot distinguish between her mother (burning) and her daughter-in-law!</p>
<p class="bas indent3"><span class="nm">v.</span>This last objection applies also according to R. Shimon, who says that burning is more stringent.</p>
<p class="bas indent2"><span class="nm">2.</span>If we say Dun Minah v'Uki b'Asra, and we want to learn that her daughter-in-law is forbidden, just like his, we would say that the punishment is like that for her mother, burning;</p>
<p class="bas indent3"><span class="nm">i.</span>According to Chachamim, stoning is more stringent. We cannot learn her She'er from his, because the Torah is more stringent about his mother than hers;</p>
<p class="bas indent3"><span class="nm">ii.</span>Also, just like we distinguish between his daughter (burning) and daughter-in-law (stoning), we must distinguish between her daughter and daughter-in-law (but both would be burned)!</p>
<p class="bas indent3"><span class="nm">iii.</span>This last objection applies also according to R. Shimon, who says that burning is more stringent.</p>
<p class="bas subject"><span class="nm">2)</span>A DAUGHTER NOT FROM HIS WIFE</p>
<p class="bas indent1"><span class="nm">(a)</span><span class="cl">Question:</span> What is the source for burning for a man who has Bi'ah with his daughter not from his wife? (The Torah explicitly mentions only his granddaughters!)</p>
<p class="bas indent1"><span class="nm">(b)</span><span class="cl">Answer #1 (Abaye):</span> If he is burned for his granddaughter, and all the more so for his daughter!</p>
<p class="bas indent2"><span class="nm">1.</span><span class="cl">Question:</span> We do not punish due to a Kal va'Chomer!</p>
<p class="bas indent2"><span class="nm">2.</span><span class="cl">Answer:</span> This is not punishing due to a Kal va'Chomer. The Kal va'Chomer merely reveals that the daughter is She'er. (The granddaughter is forbidden only because she is She'er of the daughter!)</p>
<p class="bas indent1"><span class="nm">(c)</span><span class="cl">Answer #2 (Rava):</span> We learn from Gezeros Shavos "Henah- Henah" and "Zimah-Zimah" (above 75b).</p>
<p class="bas indent1"><span class="nm">(d)</span><span class="cl">Answer #3 (R. Avin's father):</span> The Torah did not explicitly punish for a man's daughter (not from his wife). Therefore, it says "u'Vas Ish Kohen...(Ki Sechel Liznos Es Aviha...ba'Esh Yisaref)."</p>
<p class="bas indent1"><span class="nm">(e)</span><span class="cl">Question:</span> If so, just like a Bas Kohen is burned (for adultery), but the adulterer is (choked, and) not burned, likewise, if a man has Bi'ah with his daughter, she is burned, but he is not!</p>
<p class="bas indent1"><span class="nm">(f)</span><span class="cl">Answer (Abaye):</span> "Es Aviha Hi Mechaleles" - when she (is Mezanah with someone else she) profanes her father, she is burned, and not the adulterer. When her father (has incest with her and) profanes her, both are burned.</p>
<p class="bas indent1"><span class="nm">(g)</span><span class="cl">Objection (Rava):</span> Regarding a Bas Kohen, the verse excluded the adulterer from her law, so we punish him as if he had Bi'ah with a Bas Yisrael;</p>
<p class="bas indent2"><span class="nm">1.</span>Here, if her father does not receive her punishment, he would not be punished at all (if she is single) for Bi'ah with a single girl (and this is unreasonable. Men and women are equated regarding punishments)!</p>
<p class="bas indent1"><span class="nm">(h)</span><span class="cl">Question:</span> Where is a man warned about his daughter (not from his wife)?</p>
<p class="bas indent1"><span class="nm">(i)</span><span class="cl">Answer - part 1:</span> The sources Abaye and Rava brought for burning also show that he is warned.</p>
<p class="bas indent1"><span class="nm">(j)</span><span class="cl">Answer - part 2 (R. Ila'i):</span> R. Avin's father learns from "Al Techalel Es Bitcha Lehaznosah."</p>
<p class="bas indent1"><span class="nm">(k)</span><span class="cl">Question (R. Yakov, brother of Rav Acha bar Yakov):</span> We need this verse to teach a different law!</p>
<p class="bas indent2"><span class="nm">1.</span><span class="cl">(Beraisa) Suggestion:</span> Perhaps "Al Techalel Es Bitcha Lehaznosah" warns a Kohen not to marry his daughter to a Levi or Yisrael (this profanes her from her Kedushah. It forbids her to eat Terumah)!</p>
<p class="bas indent2"><span class="nm">2.</span><span class="cl">Rejection:</span> "Al Techalel Es Bitcha Lehaznosah" discusses Chilul of Zenus, one who hands over his daughter for Bi'ah without Kidushin.</p>
<p class="bas indent1"><span class="nm">(l)</span><span class="cl">Answer:</span> It could have said 'Al Techal.' "Al Techalel" (the extra 'Lamed') allows us to learn another law (like R. Ila'i).</p>
<p class="bas indent1"><span class="nm">(m)</span><span class="cl">Question:</span> What second law do Abaye and Rava learn from "Techalel"?</p>
<p class="bas indent1"><span class="nm">(n)</span><span class="cl">Answer (R. Mani):</span> It forbids marrying one's daughter to an old man (she will not be satisfied with him. She will be Mezanah.)</p>
<p class="bas indent2"><span class="nm">1.</span><span class="cl">(Beraisa - R. Eliezer):</span> "Al Techalel Es Bitcha Lehaznosah" forbids marrying off one's daughter to an old man;</p>
<p class="bas indent2"><span class="nm">2.</span>R. Akiva says, it forbids delaying marrying her off until she is a Bogeres (she already lusts for Bi'ah, and she will be Mezanah. The Rashash asks why R. Mari assumes that Abaye and Rava hold like R. Eliezer, and not like R. Akiva. Perhaps R. Mari had not heard this Beraisa!</p>
<p class="bas subject"><span class="nm">3)</span>MARRYING OFF ONE'S CHILDREN</p>
<p class="bas indent1"><span class="nm">(a)</span><span class="cl">(Rav Kahana citing R. Akiva):</span> The poorest people in Yisrael (this will be explained) are a crafty Rasha and one who delays marrying off his daughter until she is a Bogeres.</p>
<p class="bas indent1"><span class="nm">(b)</span><span class="cl">Question:</span> (Why are these considered two categories?) One who delays marrying off his daughter until she is a Bogeres is a crafty Rasha! (He does so in order that she will continue working for him, even though this causes her to be Mezanah.)</p>
<p class="bas bbbline">76b----------------------------------------76b</p>
<p class="bas indent1"><span class="nm">(c)</span><span class="cl">Answer (Abaye):</span> Indeed, Rav Kahana means that a poor crafty Rasha is one who delays marrying off his daughter until she is a Bogeres.</p>
<p class="bas indent1"><span class="nm">(d)</span><span class="cl">(Rav Kahana citing R. Akiva):</span> Beware of someone who counsels you in order to benefit himself.</p>
<p class="bas indent1"><span class="nm">(e)</span><span class="cl">(Rav Yehudah):</span> "Lema'an Sefos ha'Ravah Es ha'Tzeme'ah" (joining the thirsty (desirous) and the satiated) refers to one who marries off his daughter to an old man, or marries an adult woman to his young son, or returns a lost object to a Nochri (he shows that he considers returning lost objects a 'proper' action, and not Hash-m's Mitzvah to bestow Chesed to Yisraelim who desire serving Him).</p>
<p class="bas indent1"><span class="nm">(f)</span><span class="cl">Question (Beraisa):</span> "...Shalom Ohalecha...v'Lo Secheta" refers to one who loves his wife like himself, honors her more than himself, leads his children in the proper path, and marries them off shortly before adulthood (some explain - shortly before the usual time for marriage, 12 for girls, 18 for boys. This shows that it is praiseworthy to marry off boys when they are young!)</p>
<p class="bas indent1"><span class="nm">(g)</span><span class="cl">Answer:</span> Rav Yehudah forbids marrying them off only when they are much younger than this.</p>
<p class="bas indent1"><span class="nm">(h)</span><span class="cl">(Beraisa):</span> "Az Tikra va'Shem Ya'aneh" applies to one who loves his neighbors, draws his relatives close, marries his sister's daughter (he has a natural affinity for her, so he will surely love her), and one who lends to a poor person when he needs to borrow.</p>
<p class="bas subject"><span class="nm">4)</span>ARE BOTH OF THEM KILLED?</p>
<p class="bas indent1"><span class="nm">(a)</span><span class="cl">(Beraisa - R. Yishmael):</span> "(V'Ish Asher Yikach Es Ishah Es Imah...) Oso v'Es'hen" - (if a man 'took' a woman and her mother,) he and one of them (i.e. his mother-in-law) are killed;</p>
<p class="bas indent1"><span class="nm">(b)</span>R. Akiva says, he and both of them are killed.</p>
<p class="bas indent1"><span class="nm">(c)</span><span class="cl">Question:</span> What do they argue about?</p>
<p class="bas indent1"><span class="nm">(d)</span><span class="cl">Answer #1 (Abaye):</span> They agree about the Halachah. They argue about how do derive it.</p>
<p class="bas indent2"><span class="nm">1.</span>R. Yishmael expounds that we burn 'Oso' (him) and 'Es'hen' (one of them, the mother-in-law). In Yevani, 'Heinah' means one.</p>
<p class="bas indent3"><span class="nm">i.</span>The verse does not explicitly discuss the mother-in-law's mother. Rather, we expound it.</p>
<p class="bas indent2"><span class="nm">2.</span>R. Akiva says, Es'hen refers to both of them, the mother-in-law and <i>her</i> mother.</p>
<p class="bas indent1"><span class="nm">(e)</span><span class="cl">Answer #2 (Rava):</span> They argue about the Isur of a mother- in-law after the wife died:</p>
<p class="bas indent2"><span class="nm">1.</span>R. Yishmael learns from "v'Es'hen" that even if only one of them is alive (i.e. his wife died), the mother-in-law is killed;</p>
<p class="bas indent2"><span class="nm">2.</span>R. Akiva says that the mother-in-law is killed only if both of them are alive. If not, it is a mere Isur. (Rashi - the curse "Arur Shochev Im Chosanto" applies. Rambam - it is Chayavei Kerisus, but there is no Misah.)</p>
<p class="bas subject"><span class="nm">5)</span>THOSE THAT ARE BEHEADED</p>
<p class="bas indent1"><span class="nm">(a)</span><span class="cl">(Mishnah):</span> We behead a murderer, and people of an Ir ha'Nidachas.</p>
<p class="bas indent1"><span class="nm">(b)</span>If Reuven struck Shimon with a rock or iron, or was Metzamtzem him in (prevented him from leaving) water or a fire and he died, Reuven is killed;</p>
<p class="bas indent1"><span class="nm">(c)</span>If he pushed Shimon into water or a fire and Shimon could have left, but he died, Reuven is exempt.</p>
<p class="bas indent1"><span class="nm">(d)</span>If he incited a dog or snake to bite him, he is exempt;</p>
<p class="bas indent1"><span class="nm">(e)</span>R. Yehudah says, if he held a snake's head and pricked Shimon with the tooth, he is liable;</p>
<p class="bas indent1"><span class="nm">(f)</span>Chachamim say, he is exempt.</p>
<p class="bas indent1"><span class="nm">(g)</span><span class="cl">(Gemara - Shmuel) Question:</span> Why does the Torah mention "Yad" regarding killing with a rock or wood, but not regarding iron?</p>
<p class="bas indent1"><span class="nm">(h)</span><span class="cl">Answer:</span> Other things must be big enough to kill (if not, we will not attribute the death to the blow. 'Yad' alludes to the size to fill the hand.) Iron of any amount can kill.</p>
<p class="bas indent1"><span class="nm">(i)</span><span class="cl">(Mishnah):</span> If Reuven was Metzamtzem him in water or a fire...</p>
<p class="bas indent1"><span class="nm">(j)</span>The Reisha (this clause) teaches a Chidush, and also the Seifa.</p>
<p class="bas indent2"><span class="nm">1.</span>The Reisha teaches that even if Reuven did not push him in, since he causes that Shimon cannot leave, he is liable;</p>
<p class="bas indent2"><span class="nm">2.</span>The Seifa teaches that even if Reuven pushed him in, since Shimon could have left, he is exempt.</p>
<p class="bas subject"><span class="nm">6)</span>LIABILITY FOR METZAMTZEM</p>
<p class="bas indent1"><span class="nm">(a)</span><span class="cl">Question:</span> What is the source that one is liable for Metzamtzem?</p>
<p class="bas indent1"><span class="nm">(b)</span><span class="cl">Answer (Shmuel):</span> "Oh b'Eivah" includes Metzamtzem.</p>
<p class="bas indent1"><span class="nm">(c)</span>Levi was Metzamtzem Yehudah's animals in the sun. They died. Ravina obligated him to pay, and Rav Acha bar Rav exempted him.</p>
<p class="bas indent2"><span class="nm">1.</span>Ravina obligated from a Kal va'Chomer:</p>
<p class="bas indent2"><span class="nm">2.</span>Regarding a murderer, we only obligate if he killed intentionally and willingly, and not if he was Shogeg or Ones, yet Metzamtzem is liable. A damager pays whether he damaged Mezid or Shogeg, willingly or Ones, so all the more so he is liable for Metzamtzem!</p>
