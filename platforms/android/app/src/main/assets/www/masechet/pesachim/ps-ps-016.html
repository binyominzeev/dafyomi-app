<div class="subject"><span class="nm">1)</span><p>ARE LIQUIDS ALWAYS TEHORIM?</p></div>
<div class="indent1"><span class="nm">(a)</span><p><span class="cl">(Beraisa - R. Meir and R. Elazar):</span> If there is a Safek whether or not a liquid became Tamei, it is Tamei; if there is a Safek whether or not a liquid was Metamei something, it is Tahor [because this is a Safek mid'Rabanan];</p></div>
<div class="indent1"><span class="nm">(b)</span><p>R. Yehudah is Metamei in both cases;</p></div>
<div class="indent1"><span class="nm">(c)</span><p>R. Yosi and R. Shimon Metamei regarding food and Metaher regarding Kelim.</p></div>
<div class="indent1"><span class="nm">(d)</span><p><span class="cl">Question:</span> R. Elazar holds that liquids are not Tamei at all [mid'Oraisa]!</p></div>
<div class="indent2"><span class="nm">1.</span><p><span class="cl">(Beraisa - R. Elazar):</span> [Mid'Oraisa,] liquids are not Tamei at all - Yosi ben R. Yo'ezer testified that Ayil Kamtza (a species of grasshopper) is Tahor (permitted to eat) and that liquids (blood and water) of Beis Mitbechai (the place where Korbanos are rinsed) are Tahor!</p></div>
<div class="indent2"><span class="nm">2.</span><p>This is not difficult for Shmuel, who says that they do not Metamei other things, but they themselves can become Tamei;</p></div>
<div class="indent2"><span class="nm">3.</span><p>But Rav says that even they themselves are Tehorim - how can he answer?</p></div>
<div class="indent1"><span class="nm">(e)</span><p><span class="cl">Answer (Rav Nachman bar Yitzchak):</span> R. Elazar only holds like one of the things that R. Meir said [regarding to Metamei other things].</p></div>
<div class="indent1"><span class="nm">(f)</span><p><span class="cl">Question:</span> But it says 'like his words', i.e. his many words; also, it says 'and similarly'!</p></div>
<div class="indent1"><span class="nm">(g)</span><p>This is left difficult.</p></div>
<div class="indent1"><span class="nm">(h)</span><p><span class="cl">(Rav):</span> The liquids [in Beis Mitbechai] themselves are Tehorim;</p></div>
<div class="indent2"><span class="nm">1.</span><p>He holds that liquids cannot become Tamei mid'Oraisa, only mid'Rabanan - Chachamim decreed this elsewhere, but not in Beis Mitbechai.</p></div>
<div class="indent1"><span class="nm">(i)</span><p><span class="cl">(Shmuel):</span> They do not Metamei other things, but they themselves can become Tamei.</p></div>
<div class="indent2"><span class="nm">1.</span><p>He holds that mid'Oraisa, liquids can become Tamei, therefore, this applies everywhere; mid'Rabanan, they can Metamei other things - Chachamim decreed elsewhere, but not in Beis Mitbechai.</p></div>
<div class="indent1"><span class="nm">(j)</span><p><span class="cl">Question (Rav Huna bar Chinena):</span> If they are Temei'im, they must Metamei - "Veha'Basar Asher Yiga b'Chol Tamei Lo Ye'achel!"</p></div>
<div class="indent1"><span class="nm">(k)</span><p><span class="cl">Answer (Rav Shisha brei d'Rav Idi):</span> They are like a Revi'i of Kodesh - it is Pasul, but it is not Metamei.</p></div>
<div class="indent1"><span class="nm">(l)</span><p><span class="cl">Question (Rav Ashi):</span> A Revi'i of Kodesh is not called Tamei - liquids are called Tamei! (Presumably, Shmuel learns from the next verse cited, which calls them Tamei.)</p></div>
<div class="indent1"><span class="nm">(m)</span><p>This is left difficult.</p></div>
<div class="indent1"><span class="nm">(n)</span><p><span class="cl">Question:</span> "V'Chol Mashkeh Asher Yishaseh b'Chol Keli Yitma" (any drink can become Tamei)!</p></div>
<div class="indent1"><span class="nm">(o)</span><p><span class="cl">Answer:</span> No - "Yitma" means, it is Machshir (food cannot become Tamei until it is wet by one of seven special liquids; this is called Hechsher).</p></div>
<div class="indent1"><span class="nm">(p)</span><p><span class="cl">Question:</span> The beginning of the verse teaches about Hechsher - "Mi'Kol ha'Ochel Asher Ye'achel!"</p></div>
<div class="indent1"><span class="nm">(q)</span><p><span class="cl">Answer:</span> These teach about Hechsher through liquids connected to the ground and liquids that are not connected - we could not learn one from the other:</p></div>
<div class="indent2"><span class="nm">1.</span><p>Had it taught about uprooted liquids, one might have thought that uprooting shows that he considers them important - but connected liquids are not important [and are not Machshir];</p></div>
<div class="indent2"><span class="nm">2.</span><p>Had it taught about connected liquids, one might have thought that they are important because they are in their place - but uprooted liquids are not important.</p></div>
<div class="indent1"><span class="nm">(r)</span><p><span class="cl">Question (against Rav):</span> "Ach Mayan u'Vor Mikve Mayim Yihyeh Tahor" (connected water is Tahor - we infer that uprooted water is not)!</p></div>
<div class="indent1"><span class="nm">(s)</span><p><span class="cl">Answer:</span> It means that if a Tamei immerses in it, he will be Tahor [but not if he immerses in drawn water].</p></div>
<div class="subject"><span class="nm">2)</span><p>IS DAM KODSHIM MEKABEL TUM'AH?</p></div>
<div class="indent1"><span class="nm">(a)</span><p><span class="cl">Question:</span> Uprooted water is not Machshir!</p></div>
<div class="indent2"><span class="nm">1.</span><p><span class="cl">(R. Yosi b'Rebbi Chanina):</span> Liquids in Beis Mitbechai are Tehorim; further, they are not even Machshir!</p></div>
<div class="indent1"><span class="nm">(b)</span><p><span class="cl">Answer:</span> He refers only to blood.</p></div>
<div class="indent2"><span class="nm">1.</span><p><span class="cl">(R. Chiya bar Aba) Question:</span> What is the source that blood of Kodshim is not Machshir [even though Dam Chulin is Machshir]?</p></div>
<div class="indent2"><span class="nm">2.</span><p><span class="cl">Answer:</span> "Al ha'Aretz Tishpechenu ka'Mayim" - only blood which is spilled like water is Machshir [but not blood of Kodshim, which is caught in a Keli for Zerikah].</p></div>
<div class="bbbline">16b----------------------------------------16b</p></div>
<div class="indent1"><span class="nm">(c)</span><p><span class="cl">Question (Rav Shmuel bar Ami):</span> Dam Tamtzis (blood that drips out, it is Pasul for Zerikah) is spilled like water, yet it is not Machshir!</p></div>
<div class="indent1"><span class="nm">(d)</span><p><span class="cl">Answer (R. Zeira):</span> Even Dam Tamtzis of Chulin is not Machshir (this will be explained).</p></div>
<div class="indent1"><span class="nm">(e)</span><p>Rav Shmuel bar Ami accepted this answer, for it says "Ki ha'Dam Hu ha'Nafesh" - only Dam [ha'Nefesh, that <i>flows</i> out] at the time of death is considered blood.</p></div>
<div class="indent1"><span class="nm">(f)</span><p><span class="cl">Question (Beraisa):</span> If blood became Tamei and Zerikah was done:</p></div>
<div class="indent2"><span class="nm">1.</span><p>If it was b'Shogeg, it is Meratzeh (one fulfilled his obligation to bring the Korban); if b'Mezid, Lo Hurtzeh. (Blood is Mekabel Tum'ah mid'Oraisa!)</p></div>
<div class="indent1"><span class="nm">(g)</span><p><span class="cl">Answer:</span> This refers to Tum'ah mid'Rabanan - it is unlike Yosi ben Yo'ezer [who says that even mid'Rabanan it is not Mekabel Tum'ah].</p></div>
<div class="indent1"><span class="nm">(h)</span><p><span class="cl">Question (Beraisa):</span> The Tzitz (see note in Appendix) is Meratzeh for blood, meat and Chelev that became Tamei, whether b'Shogeg or b'Mezid or b'Ones, for a Korban Yachid or a Korban Tzibur.</p></div>
<div class="indent1"><span class="nm">(i)</span><p><span class="cl">Answer:</span> This refers to Tum'ah mid'Rabanan - it is unlike Yosi ben Yo'ezer.</p></div>
<div class="indent1"><span class="nm">(j)</span><p><span class="cl">(Beraisa) Question:</span> "V'Nosa Aharon Es Avon ha'Kodoshim" - what sin does the Tzitz bear?</p></div>
<div class="indent2"><span class="nm">1.</span><p>It cannot be Pigul, for it says "Lo Yechashev" (it is Pasul - even the Tzitz will not help! Here, Pigul refers to Kodshim Nifsal through intent to eat outside the permitted place.)</p></div>
<div class="indent2"><span class="nm">2.</span><p>It cannot be Nosar, for it says "Lo Yeratzeh" (in any case it is Pasul. Here, Nosar refers to what the Torah calls Pigul, i.e. a Korban offered with intent to eat it when it is Nosar, i.e. Chutz li'Zmano.)</p></div>
<div class="indent2"><span class="nm">3.</span><p><span class="cl">Answer:</span> It bears the sin of Tum'ah, for Tum'ah is wholly permitted to the Tzibur (if a Korban Tzibur with a fixed time cannot be brought in Taharah, we bring it b'Tum'ah).</p></div>
<div class="indent2"><span class="nm">4.</span><p><span class="cl">Suggestion:</span> This refers to [mid'Oraisa] Tum'ah of blood!</p></div>
<div class="indent1"><span class="nm">(k)</span><p><span class="cl">Answer (Rav Papa):</span> No, it refers to Tum'ah of a Kometz.</p></div>
