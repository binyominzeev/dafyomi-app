<div class="subject"><span class="nm">1)</span><p>VALIDATION OF A DOCUMENT (cont.)</p></div>
<div class="indent1"><span class="nm">(a)</span><p><span class="cl">(Gemara):</span> According to Rebbi, witnesses testify about their own signatures. According to Chachamim, they testify about the content of the document.</p></div>
<div class="indent1"><span class="nm">(b)</span><p><span class="cl">Objection:</span> This is obvious!</p></div>
<div class="indent1"><span class="nm">(c)</span><p><span class="cl">Answer:</span> One might have thought that Rebbi is unsure whether the witnesses testify about their own signatures or about the content of the document.</p></div>
<div class="indent2"><span class="nm">1.</span><p>If Rebbi was unsure, this would affect the law if one witness died. Rebbi would require two witnesses to testify about his signature.</p></div>
<div class="indent2"><span class="nm">2.</span><p>It would not suffice for the live witness and another person to testify about the signatures.</p></div>
<div class="indent3"><span class="nm">i.</span><p>If so, the live witness would (perhaps) be giving three fourths of the testimony. (Perhaps when he verifies his signature he testifies alone about the content of the document, and he also helps to confirm the other signature.)</p></div>
<div class="indent2"><span class="nm">3.</span><p>Rebbi would be stringent in this case, and also stringent in the case of the Mishnah (when each confirms only his own signature).</p></div>
<div class="indent2"><span class="nm">4.</span><p>Therefore, we needed to teach that Rebbi is sure that they testify about their signatures.</p></div>
<div class="indent1"><span class="nm">(d)</span><p><span class="cl">(Rav Yehudah):</span> If one of the witnesses dies, two others are needed to confirm his signature.</p></div>
<div class="indent2"><span class="nm">1.</span><p>In this case Rebbi is more lenient than Chachamim.</p></div>
<div class="indent1"><span class="nm">(e)</span><p><span class="cl">Question:</span> What can we do if there is only one other who recognizes his signature (in addition to the live witness)?</p></div>
<div class="indent1"><span class="nm">(f)</span><p><span class="cl">Answer (Abaye):</span> The live witness should write his name on a piece of pottery and give it to Beis Din.</p></div>
<div class="indent2"><span class="nm">1.</span><p>Now we do not need him to confirm his own signature, so he may help confirm the other signature.</p></div>
<div class="indent1"><span class="nm">(g)</span><p>He should sign specifically on pottery, but not on a parchment, lest a corrupt person find it, and write like he pleases above the signature.</p></div>
<div class="indent2"><span class="nm">1.</span><p><span class="cl">(Mishnah):</span> If Reuven signed a document saying that he owes Shimon, Shimon collects from unsold property.</p></div>
<div class="indent1"><span class="nm">(h)</span><p><span class="cl">(Rav Yehudah citing Shmuel):</span> The Halachah follows Chachamim.</p></div>
<div class="indent1"><span class="nm">(i)</span><p><span class="cl">Question:</span> Why did he need to say this? The Halachah (normally) follows the majority!</p></div>
<div class="indent1"><span class="nm">(j)</span><p><span class="cl">Answer:</span> The Halachah (normally) follows Rebbi when he argues with one Tana. One might have thought that the Halachah follows him even against a majority!</p></div>
<div class="indent1"><span class="nm">(k)</span><p><span class="cl">Question (Rav Chinena bar Chiya):</span> Did Shmuel really say that the Halachah follows Chachamim?</p></div>
<div class="indent2"><span class="nm">1.</span><p>There was a document validated in Shmuel's Beis Din that said that both witnesses confirmed both signatures!</p></div>
<div class="indent1"><span class="nm">(l)</span><p><span class="cl">Answer (Rav Yehudah):</span> That document was of orphans;</p></div>
<div class="indent2"><span class="nm">1.</span><p>Shmuel was extra careful to validate it in such a way that even if a Beis Din will mistakenly think that <i>here</i> the Halachah follows Rebbi against a majority, they will still accept the validation.</p></div>
<div class="subject"><span class="nm">2)</span><p>VALIDATION OF A VALIDATED DOCUMENT</p></div>
<div class="indent1"><span class="nm">(a)</span><p><span class="cl">(Rav Yehudah citing Shmuel):</span> A witness may join a judge. (If someone claims that a validated document was forged, it suffices for one witness to confirm his signature and one of the validating judges to confirm his signature.)</p></div>
<div class="indent1"><span class="nm">(b)</span><p><span class="cl">Rami bar Chama:</span> What a wonderful teaching!</p></div>
<div class="indent1"><span class="nm">(c)</span><p><span class="cl">Rava:</span> No! They do not join, since they testify about different matters! (This is like Chachamim, who say that a witness testifies about the content of the document.)</p></div>
<div class="indent1"><span class="nm">(d)</span><p><span class="cl">Rami bar Yechezkel:</span> Do not heed these rules that my brother (Rav Yehudah) quotes in the name of Shmuel.</p></div>
<div class="bbbline">21b----------------------------------------21b</p></div>
<div class="indent1"><span class="nm">(e)</span><p><span class="cl">(Ravnoy citing Shmuel):</span> A witness may join a judge.</p></div>
<div class="indent1"><span class="nm">(f)</span><p><span class="cl">Ameimar:</span> What a wonderful teaching!</p></div>
<div class="indent1"><span class="nm">(g)</span><p><span class="cl">Rav Ashi:</span> Because your grandfather (Rami bar Chama) praised it, also you praise it? Rava refuted it!</p></div>
<div class="subject"><span class="nm">3)</span><p>JUDGES WHO RECOGNIZE THE SIGNATURES</p></div>
<div class="indent1"><span class="nm">(a)</span><p><span class="cl">(Rav Safra quoting R. Aba):</span> If three judges sat to validate a document and two of them recognize the signatures, before the two sign they testify about the signatures in front of the third judge. Then, all three sign the validation;</p></div>
<div class="indent1"><span class="nm">(b)</span><p>If the two judges signed before testifying, they may not testify to enable the third judge to sign.</p></div>
<div class="indent1"><span class="nm">(c)</span><p><span class="cl">Inference:</span> The <i>text</i> of the validation may be written before the testimony.</p></div>
<div class="indent1"><span class="nm">(d)</span><p><span class="cl">Objection:</span> Rav Papi taught that a validation that was written before testimony on the signatures is invalid, since it appears false;</p></div>
<div class="indent2"><span class="nm">1.</span><p>Here too, it appears false (to write that all three judges knew the signatures before the third heard testimony)!</p></div>
<div class="indent1"><span class="nm">(e)</span><p><span class="cl">Correction:</span> Rather, the two judges testify before writing the validation. If it was already written, they may not testify to enable the third judge to sign.</p></div>
<div class="indent1"><span class="nm">(f)</span><p>We learn three laws from this teaching;</p></div>
<div class="indent2"><span class="nm">1.</span><p>A witness can act like a judge after testifying.</p></div>
<div class="indent2"><span class="nm">2.</span><p>If the judges recognize the signatures, there is no need to testify in front of them.</p></div>
<div class="indent2"><span class="nm">3.</span><p>If the judges do not recognize the signatures, testimony must be given in front of all of them.</p></div>
<div class="indent1"><span class="nm">(g)</span><p><span class="cl">Objection (Rav Ashi):</span> I agree that we learn that a witness can become a judge (1);</p></div>
<div class="indent2"><span class="nm">1.</span><p>However, we cannot learn that if the judges recognize the signatures, there is no need to testify in front of them (2). In R. Aba's case, there is some testimony in front of the third judge!</p></div>
<div class="indent2"><span class="nm">2.</span><p>Also, we cannot learn that if the judges do not recognize the signatures, testimony must be given in front of all of them (3). R. Aba's case is different. If we do not testify in front of the third judge, no testimony is given at all!</p></div>
<div class="indent1"><span class="nm">(h)</span><p><span class="cl">Question (Rav Safra to R. Aba - Mishnah):</span> If three members of the Beis Din that determines Rosh Chodesh saw the new moon, two of them stand. They seat two other judges of the Beis Din by the third, and the first two testify in front of them;</p></div>
<div class="indent2"><span class="nm">1.</span><p>An individual cannot declare the new month. Rather, all three declare it.</p></div>
<div class="indent2"><span class="nm">2.</span><p>If a witness could become a judge, (they would not need two more judges. Two would testify in front of the third, and) the three who saw could declare the new month!</p></div>
<div class="indent1"><span class="nm">(i)</span><p><span class="cl">Answer (R. Aba citing Rav):</span> Declaration of the new month is mid'Oraisa, so for this a witness cannot become a judge. Validation of documents is mid'Rabanan, so for this a witness can become a judge.</p></div>
