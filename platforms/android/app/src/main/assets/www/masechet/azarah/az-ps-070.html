<p class="bas subject"><span class="nm">1)</span>WHEN ARE 'NOCHRIM' AFRAID TO TOUCH?</p>
<p class="bas indent1"><span class="nm">(a)</span><span class="cl">(Rava):</span> If Yisraelim were with a Nochris harlot (and there was wine of Yisraelim there), we are not concerned lest they were (Rashi; Ran - allowed her to be) Menasech;</p>
<p class="bas indent2"><span class="nm">1.</span>Granted, lust for relations overcomes them, but the desire for Nisuch is not so great.</p>
<p class="bas indent1"><span class="nm">(b)</span>If Nochrim were with a Yisraelis harlot, the wine is forbidden;</p>
<p class="bas indent2"><span class="nm">1.</span>She is loose with them, and she is drawn after their ways. We are concerned lest she allowed them to be Menasech.</p>
<p class="bas indent1"><span class="nm">(c)</span>Reuven's wine was in a house. A Nochri entered and closed the door. There was a crack in the door. The Nochri could be seen between the barrels.</p>
<p class="bas indent1"><span class="nm">(d)</span><span class="cl">(Rava):</span> The barrels that can be seen through the crack are permitted (even to drink them). Those outside the field of vision are forbidden (Rashi - to benefit from them (also in the coming cases); Ra'avad - to drink).</p>
<p class="bas indent1"><span class="nm">(e)</span>Reuven's wine was in a house. A Nochri lived on the ground floor, and a Yisrael in the second story. They heard a dispute and went outside to see. The Nochri returned and closed the door.</p>
<p class="bas indent1"><span class="nm">(f)</span><span class="cl">(Rava):</span> The wine is permitted. The Nochri suspects that the Yisrael returned first. He fears to touch the wine lest the Yisrael see him from above.</p>
<p class="bas indent1"><span class="nm">(g)</span>Reuven's wine was in an inn. A Nochri was found near it.</p>
<p class="bas indent1"><span class="nm">(h)</span><span class="cl">(Rava):</span> If the Nochri has no permission to be there (and seemingly entered to steal) he is nervous, he would not touch the wine, it is permitted; if not, it is forbidden.</p>
<p class="bas indent1"><span class="nm">(i)</span>Reuven's wine was in a house; a Nochri was found near it.</p>
<p class="bas indent1"><span class="nm">(j)</span><span class="cl">(Rava):</span> If the Nochri has an excuse why he is there, he is not afraid, so it is forbidden. If not, it is permitted.</p>
<p class="bas indent1"><span class="nm">(k)</span><span class="cl">Question (Beraisa):</span> If an inn was locked (and a Nochri was alone with wine inside), or if a Yisrael asked him to guard the wine (from the outside), it is forbidden.</p>
<p class="bas indent2"><span class="nm">1.</span><span class="cl">Suggestion:</span> It is forbidden even if the Nochri has no excuse why he is there.</p>
<p class="bas indent1"><span class="nm">(l)</span><span class="cl">Answer:</span> No, the case is that he has an excuse.</p>
<p class="bas indent1"><span class="nm">(m)</span>A Yisrael and a Nochri were drinking wine together. They heard people calling that it is time to pray in the Beis ha'Keneses. The Yisrael left.</p>
<p class="bas indent1"><span class="nm">(n)</span><span class="cl">(Rava):</span> The wine is permitted. At every moment, the Nochri is concerned lest the Yisrael remembered that he left his wine and is returning for it.</p>
<p class="bas indent1"><span class="nm">(o)</span>A Yisrael and a Nochri were drinking wine together on a boat. They heard the Shofar blasts signifying to stop working because Shabbos has come. The Yisrael went ashore.</p>
<p class="bas indent1"><span class="nm">(p)</span><span class="cl">(Rava):</span> The wine is permitted. At every moment, the Nochri is concerned lest the Yisrael remembered his wine and is returning for it;</p>
<p class="bas indent2"><span class="nm">1.</span>Nochrim think that Yisraelim do not observe Shabbos (if it will entail a loss).</p>
<p class="bas indent2"><span class="nm">2.</span><span class="cl">(Isar the convert):</span> When I was a Nochri, we used to say that Yisraelim do not observe Shabbos. If they did, many wallets would be found in the market (of Yisraelim who were on the road when Shabbos came, and are forbidden to carry their wallets home).</p>
<p class="bas indent2"><span class="nm">3.</span>Nochrim do not know R. Yitzchak's law.</p>
<p class="bas indent3"><span class="nm">i.</span><span class="cl">(R. Yitzchak):</span> If one found a wallet (and picked it up before Shabbos, and there is not a Nochri, animal, deaf-mute, lunatic or child to carry it), on Shabbos he may carry it up to (but not including) four Amos at a time. (I.e. after stopping, he may again carry it up to four Amos... )</p>
<p class="bas indent1"><span class="nm">(q)</span>A Nochri at the winepress heard a lion roar. He hid among the barrels.</p>
<p class="bas indent1"><span class="nm">(r)</span><span class="cl">(Rava):</span> The wine is permitted. He assumes that Yisraelim are also hiding, so he is afraid to touch the wine.</p>
<p class="bas subject"><span class="nm">2)</span>IF THIEVES OPENED WINE</p>
<p class="bas indent1"><span class="nm">(a)</span>Thieves came to Pumbadisa and opened many barrels of wine. Rava permitted them.</p>
<p class="bas indent1"><span class="nm">(b)</span><span class="cl">Question:</span> What was his reason?</p>
<p class="bas indent1"><span class="nm">(c)</span><span class="cl">Answer:</span> Most thieves in Pumbadisa are Yisraelim (who are the vast majority of the residents).</p>
<p class="bas indent1"><span class="nm">(d)</span>A similar case occurred in Neharde'a. Shmuel permitted the wine.</p>
<p class="bas indent1"><span class="nm">(e)</span><span class="cl">Suggestion:</span> This is like R. Eliezer (and unlike Chachamim who are Metamei in both cases in the coming Mishnah).</p>
<p class="bas indent2"><span class="nm">1.</span><span class="cl">(Mishnah - R. Eliezer):</span> (There was Tum'ah in a certain field in a valley.) If Shimon entered the valley but does not know whether he entered that field, he is Tahor. (Here also, we do not know whether a Nochri entered the house.)</p>
<p class="bas indent3"><span class="nm">i.</span>If he (knows that he entered that field, but is unsure whether he touched the Tum'ah) he is Tamei.</p>
<p class="bas indent1"><span class="nm">(f)</span><span class="cl">Rejection:</span> No. Even Chachamim permit, because some thieves open barrels looking for valuables, so it is a Sefek Sefeka (two doubts. Perhaps a Yisrael opened the barrels. Even if a Nochri opened them, perhaps he was only seeking valuables, and when he saw that it was wine he did not touch it.)</p>
<p class="bas bbbline">70b----------------------------------------70b</p>
<p class="bas indent1"><span class="nm">(g)</span>A (Rashi - young) Nochris was found among barrels of wine, foam of wine was in her hand.</p>
<p class="bas indent1"><span class="nm">(h)</span><span class="cl">(Rava):</span> The wine is permitted. Perhaps the foam came to her hand from the outside of the barrel;</p>
<p class="bas indent2"><span class="nm">1.</span>Even if we do not see any other foam on the outside, perhaps she happened to touch the one place where there was foam.</p>
<p class="bas indent1"><span class="nm">(i)</span>A general (and his army) came to Neharde'a. They opened many barrels of wine.</p>
<p class="bas indent1"><span class="nm">(j)</span><span class="cl">Rav Dimi:</span> A similar case occurred (in Eretz Yisrael), and R. Elazar permitted it;</p>
<p class="bas indent2"><span class="nm">1.</span>I am unsure. Perhaps this was because he holds like R. Eliezer (who is lenient about a doubt if the Tamei field was entered);</p>
<p class="bas indent2"><span class="nm">2.</span>Or, perhaps it was because most soldiers who follow a general are Yisraelim.</p>
<p class="bas indent2"><span class="nm">3.</span><span class="cl">Version #1 (Rashi) Question:</span> (If the first answer assumes that most soldiers who follow a general are Nochrim, and we do not know whether the barrels were opened for drinking or in search of money,) this is not Safek entering. Rather, it is Safek touching! (Even R. Eliezer is stringent)!</p>
<p class="bas indent2"><span class="nm">4.</span><span class="cl">Version #2 (Tosfos) Question:</span> (The first answer considers the soldiers to be Safek Nochrim.) R. Eliezer permitted only a Sefek Sefeka. Here there is a single doubt (whether a Yisrael or Nochri touched)! (end of Version #2)</p>
<p class="bas indent2"><span class="nm">5.</span><span class="cl">Answer:</span> The case is, they opened more barrels than needed for drinking. Presumably, most barrels were opened to look for valuables. Therefore, it is like Safek entering. (Tosfos - therefore, also this is a Sefek Sefeka, like Shmuel's ruling above.)</p>
<p class="bas subject"><span class="nm">3)</span>WHO IS BELIEVED ABOUT 'TAHAROS'</p>
<p class="bas indent1"><span class="nm">(a)</span>A Yisraelis used to sell wine. She gave the keys to a Nochris to guard.</p>
<p class="bas indent1"><span class="nm">(b)</span><span class="cl">(R. Yitzchak):</span> A case occurred, and Rabanan said that the Nochris was entrusted only with the keys. (She has no excuse to be near the wine, therefore she is afraid to touch.)</p>
<p class="bas indent1"><span class="nm">(c)</span><span class="cl">Support (Abaye - Mishnah):</span> If a Chaver (one who is careful about Tum'ah) gave his keys to an ignoramus to guard, the Chaver's Taharos are still Tahor, for the ignoramus was entrusted only with the keys (he has no excuse to touch the Taharos).</p>
<p class="bas indent2"><span class="nm">1.</span>Since the Taharos are still Tahor, all the more so the wine should be permitted!</p>
<p class="bas indent1"><span class="nm">(d)</span><span class="cl">Inference:</span> Abaye said 'all the more so.' He holds that we are more stringent about Taharos than about Yayin Nesech.</p>
<p class="bas indent1"><span class="nm">(e)</span><span class="cl">Confirmation:</span> Yes! This is like Rav.</p>
<p class="bas indent2"><span class="nm">1.</span><span class="cl">(Rav):</span> If a Mesifas (Rashi - a low fence; Aruch - a fence with windows) divided a Chatzer, and a Chaver put Taharos on his side (and an ignoramus lives on the other side), they are (assumed to be) Teme'im;</p>
<p class="bas indent2"><span class="nm">2.</span><span class="cl">(R. Yochanan):</span> They are Tehorim.</p>
<p class="bas indent2"><span class="nm">3.</span><span class="cl">Question (against Rav - Beraisa):</span> If a Chaver lives in a Chatzer whose only exit to Reshus ha'Rabim is through the Chatzer of an ignoramus, he may put Taharos near the border of the Chatzeros, even if the ignoramus could reach them (and they are Tehorim).</p>
<p class="bas indent2"><span class="nm">4.</span><span class="cl">Answer (Rav):</span> There is different. The ignoramus will not touch them, for he has no excuse to enter the Chaver's Chatzer. If he would reach over, it would appear that he wants to steal.</p>
<p class="bas indent2"><span class="nm">5.</span><span class="cl">Question (against R. Yochanan - Beraisa - R. Shimon ben Gamliel):</span> If a Chaver's roof is adjacent to and higher than his neighbor's (an ignoramus), he may not put Taharos there unless they are out of the reach of his neighbor.</p>
<p class="bas indent2"><span class="nm">6.</span><span class="cl">Answer (R. Yochanan):</span> That case is different. His neighbor has an excuse to reach over. He could say that he was measuring (Me'iri - testing the sturdiness of) the roof. (Aruch - he could say that he was stretching)!</p>
<p class="bas indent2"><span class="nm">7.</span><span class="cl">Question (against Rav - Beraisa):</span> If a Chaver's roof is adjacent to his neighbor's (an ignoramus), he may put Taharos on it, even within his neighbor's reach.</p>
<p class="bas indent2"><span class="nm">8.</span><span class="cl">Answer (Rav):</span> Tana'im argue about this. I hold like R. Shimon ben Gamliel. (This could be a second answer to Question (3).)</p>
<p class="bas subject"><span class="nm">4)</span>DO SOLDIERS HAVE TIME TO BE <i>MENASECH?</i></p>
<p class="bas indent1"><span class="nm">(a)</span><span class="cl">(Mishnah):</span> If an army entered a city in peacetime, open barrels of wine are forbidden, and closed barrels are permitted;</p>
<p class="bas indent1"><span class="nm">(b)</span>In wartime, all are permitted, because they do not have time to Menasech.</p>
