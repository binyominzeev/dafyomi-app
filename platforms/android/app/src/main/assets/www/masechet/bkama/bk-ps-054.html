<p class="bas subject"><span class="nm">1)</span>DOES ONE PAY FOR <i>KELIM</i> DAMAGED IN A PIT? (cont.)</p>
<p class="bas indent1"><span class="nm">(a)</span><span class="cl">Question:</span> "And will fall" is a Klal (general term). "Ox and donkey" are Peratim (specific terms). From a Klal u'Frat, we should include only the Peratim!</p>
<p class="bas indent1"><span class="nm">(b)</span><span class="cl">Rejection:</span> "The owner of the pit will pay" is another Prat. From a Klal u'Frat u'Chlal we learn everything that is like the Prat;</p>
<p class="bas indent2"><span class="nm">1.</span>The Peratim are living. We learn everything living.</p>
<p class="bas indent1"><span class="nm">(c)</span><span class="cl">Question:</span> For both Peratim, their carcasses have Tum'as Maga u'Masa (make Tamei something that touches or moves them). We should learn only such things (but not birds)!</p>
<p class="bas indent1"><span class="nm">(d)</span><span class="cl">Answer #1:</span> If so, the Torah should only have written one Prat. (Since it wrote two, we include also birds.)</p>
<p class="bas indent1"><span class="nm">(e)</span><span class="cl">Objection:</span> Which one should it have written?</p>
<p class="bas indent2"><span class="nm">1.</span>Had it written only "ox", one might have thought that we include only animals that are offered on the Mizbe'ach!</p>
<p class="bas indent2"><span class="nm">2.</span>Had it written only "donkey", one might have thought that we only include animals whose firstborn have Kedushah!</p>
<p class="bas indent1"><span class="nm">(f)</span><span class="cl">Answer #2:</span> Rather, we learn from "and the dead animal will be to him" - anything that dies.</p>
<p class="bas indent1"><span class="nm">(g)</span><span class="cl">Question:</span> If so, why do Chachamim need "donkey" to exclude Kelim, and why does R. Yehudah obligate for Kelim (Rashi; Tosfos - also R. Yehudah would have used "donkey" to exclude Kelim, if not for "or")?</p>
<p class="bas indent1"><span class="nm">(h)</span><span class="cl">Answer:</span> Breakage of Kelim is their death.</p>
<p class="bas indent1"><span class="nm">(i)</span><span class="cl">Question:</span> Rav holds that one is liable only for the Hevel of a pit, which cannot break Kelim. Why do the Tana'im need verses to exclude or include Kelim? <span class="note">(<span class="notewd">Note:</span> we said that Rav agrees that one is liable for the blow in a pit in Reshus ha'Yachid! Perhaps we ask according to opinion that R. Yishmael only in Reshus ha'Rabim?</p>
<p class="bas indent1"><span class="nm">(j)</span><span class="cl">Answer:</span> Hevel can break new Kelim.</p>
<p class="bas indent1"><span class="nm">(k)</span><span class="cl">Objection:</span> We need "and the carcass will be to him" for Rava's law!</p>
<p class="bas indent1"><span class="nm">(l)</span><span class="cl">Answer #3:</span> "He will return money to its owner" includes anything with an owner.</p>
<p class="bas indent1"><span class="nm">(m)</span><span class="cl">Question:</span> If so, even people and Kelim should be included!</p>
<p class="bas indent1"><span class="nm">(n)</span><span class="cl">Answer:</span> We expound "and an ox or a donkey fell" - "an ox", but not people; "a donkey", but not Kelim.</p>
<p class="bas indent1"><span class="nm">(o)</span><span class="cl">Question:</span> According to R. Yehudah, who obligates for Kelim, what does "a donkey" come to exclude?</p>
<p class="bas indent1"><span class="nm">(p)</span><span class="cl">Rava:</span> This is difficult;</p>
<p class="bas indent2"><span class="nm">1.</span>Also, we do not know what any Tana learns from "Seh" in the Parshah of an Aveidah.</p>
<p class="bas subject"><span class="nm">2)</span></span> FOR WHAT KIND OF ANIMALS IS A PIT LIABLE?</p>
<p class="bas indent1"><span class="nm">(a)</span><span class="cl">(Mishnah):</span> If an ox fell in, if deaf, insane, or a child, the owner is paid.</p>
<p class="bas indent1"><span class="nm">(b)</span><span class="cl">Question:</span> What does this mean?</p>
<p class="bas indent2"><span class="nm">1.</span><span class="cl">Suggestion:</span> The owner of the ox is deaf, insane, or a child. 2.  Rejection: Surely, one is liable also for the ox of a healthy adult!</p>
<p class="bas indent1"><span class="nm">(c)</span><span class="cl">Answer (R. Yochanan):</span> It means, the ox is deaf, insane or (very) young.</p>
<p class="bas bbbline">54b----------------------------------------54b</p>
<p class="bas indent1"><span class="nm">(d)</span><span class="cl">Question:</span> If the ox was healthy, would the pit's owner be exempt?!</p>
<p class="bas indent1"><span class="nm">(e)</span><span class="cl">Answer #1 (R. Yirmiyah):</span> The Mishnah teaches a bigger Chidush.</p>
<p class="bas indent2"><span class="nm">1.</span>One is liable not only for a healthy ox. Rather, he is liable even for a deaf, insane or young ox;</p>
<p class="bas indent2"><span class="nm">2.</span>One might have thought that its deficiency caused it to fall, and one is exempt for it. The Mishnah teaches that this is not so.</p>
<p class="bas indent1"><span class="nm">(f)</span><span class="cl">Question (R. Acha - Beraisa):</span> If one with Da'as (understanding) fell in, he is exempt.</p>
<p class="bas indent2"><span class="nm">1.</span><span class="cl">Suggestion:</span> This refers to a sane ox.</p>
<p class="bas indent1"><span class="nm">(g)</span><span class="cl">Answer #1 (Ravina):</span> No, it refers to a sane person.</p>
<p class="bas indent1"><span class="nm">(h)</span><span class="cl">Question (R. Acha):</span> This connotes that one is liable if an insane person falls in. The verse says "an ox", not a person!</p>
<p class="bas indent1"><span class="nm">(i)</span><span class="cl">Answer #2 (Ravina):</span> Rather, the Beraisa means that if one of the species of those with Da'as (i.e. a person) fell in, he is exempt.</p>
<p class="bas indent1"><span class="nm">(j)</span><span class="cl">Objection (R. Acha - Beraisa):</span> If an ox with Da'as fell in, he is exempt.</p>
<p class="bas indent1"><span class="nm">(k)</span><span class="cl">Answer #2 (to Question (d) - Rava):</span> Indeed, one is liable only for an ox that is deaf, insane or young. If the ox was healthy, the pit's owner is exempt.</p>
<p class="bas indent1"><span class="nm">(l)</span><span class="cl">Question:</span> What is the reason?</p>
<p class="bas indent1"><span class="nm">(m)</span><span class="cl">Answer:</span> The ox should have watched where it is walking.</p>
<p class="bas indent1"><span class="nm">(n)</span><span class="cl">Support (Beraisa):</span> If an ox is deaf, insane, young, blind or walking at night, the pit owner is liable;</p>
<p class="bas indent2"><span class="nm">1.</span>If the ox was healthy and fell in during the day, he is exempt.</p>
<p class="bas subject"><span class="nm">3)</span>LAWS THAT APPLY TO ALL ANIMALS</p>
<p class="bas indent1"><span class="nm">(a)</span><span class="cl">(Mishnah):</span> The following apply to all Behemos (domestic animals), Chayos (wild animals) and fowl:</p>
<p class="bas indent2"><span class="nm">1.</span>Falling into a pit;</p>
<p class="bas indent2"><span class="nm">2.</span>The Mitzvah to keep animals from ascending Mount Sinai (when the Torah was given);</p>
<p class="bas indent2"><span class="nm">3.</span>The double payment of a thief;</p>
<p class="bas indent2"><span class="nm">4.</span>Returning a lost animal;</p>
<p class="bas indent2"><span class="nm">5.</span>Unloading an animal;</p>
<p class="bas indent2"><span class="nm">6.</span>Muzzling an animal;</p>
<p class="bas indent2"><span class="nm">7.</span>Working with or crossbreeding diverse species;</p>
<p class="bas indent2"><span class="nm">8.</span>Making it work on Shabbos.</p>
<p class="bas indent1"><span class="nm">(b)</span>The Torah said 'ox' or 'donkey', for this is the usual case.</p>
<p class="bas indent1"><span class="nm">(c)</span><span class="cl">(Gemara):</span> Regarding a pit we learn from "he will return money to its owner" - anything with an owner.</p>
<p class="bas indent1"><span class="nm">(d)</span>Regarding ascending Mount Sinai it says "whether Behemah or man, it will not live";</p>
<p class="bas indent2"><span class="nm">1.</span>"Behemah" includes wild animals. "Whether" includes fowl.</p>
<p class="bas indent1"><span class="nm">(e)</span>Regarding the d2, payment of a thief it says "for any matter of transgression";</p>
<p class="bas indent1"><span class="nm">(f)</span>Regarding returning a lost animal it says "for any Aveidah of your brother";</p>
<p class="bas indent1"><span class="nm">(g)</span>We learn about unloading from a Gezeirah Shavah "Chamor-Chamor" from Shabbos;</p>
<p class="bas indent1"><span class="nm">(h)</span>We learn about muzzling from a Gezeirah Shavah "Shor- Shor" from Shabbos;</p>
<p class="bas indent1"><span class="nm">(i)</span>We learn about working with diverse species from a Gezeirah Shavah "Shor-Shor" from Shabbos;</p>
<p class="bas indent2"><span class="nm">1.</span>We learn about crossbreeding diverse species from a Gezeirah Shavah "Behemah-Behemah" from Shabbos.</p>
<p class="bas subject"><span class="nm">4)</span>HOW WE DERIVE THAT THE LAWS OF <i>SHABBOS</i> APPLY TO ALL ANIMALS</p>
<p class="bas indent1"><span class="nm">(a)</span><span class="cl">Question:</span> How do we learn regarding Shabbos?</p>
<p class="bas indent1"><span class="nm">(b)</span><span class="cl">Answer (Beraisa - R. Yosi):</span> In the first version of the 10 Utterances (in Shemos), it says "your male slave, female slave and Behemah." In the second version (in Devarim), it says "your ox, donkey and all your Behemos".</p>
<p class="bas indent2"><span class="nm">1.</span><span class="cl">Question:</span> 'Behemah' includes oxen and donkeys. Why were they explicitly mentioned?</p>
<p class="bas indent2"><span class="nm">2.</span><span class="cl">Answer:</span> This teaches that just like regarding Shabbos, it says "ox and donkey" but the law applies to Chayos and fowl, also whenever they are mentioned in the Torah.</p>
<p class="bas indent1"><span class="nm">(c)</span><span class="cl">Question:</span> We should say that "Behemah" of the first version (of the Utterances) is a Klal, "ox and donkey" of the second version is a Prat. From a Klal u'Frat, we only learn the Prat, an ox or donkey!</p>
<p class="bas indent1"><span class="nm">(d)</span><span class="cl">Answer #1:</span> "And all your Behemos" of the second version is another Klal. From a Klal u'Frat u'Chlal we learn everything that is like the Prat, in our case, living things.</p>
<p class="bas indent2"><span class="nm">1.</span><span class="cl">Question:</span> For both Peratim, their carcasses impart Tum'ah through touching or moving - we should only learn such things (but not birds)!</p>
<p class="bas indent2"><span class="nm">2.</span><span class="cl">Answer #1:</span> If so, the Torah should only have written one Prat. (Since it wrote two, we also include birds.)</p>
<p class="bas indent2"><span class="nm">3.</span><span class="cl">Question:</span> Which one should it have written?</p>
<p class="bas indent3"><span class="nm">i.</span>Had it written only "ox" - one might have thought that we only include animals that are offered on the Mizbe'ach!</p>
<p class="bas indent3"><span class="nm">ii.</span>Had it written only "donkey" - one might have thought that we only include animals whose firstborn have Kedushah!</p>
<p class="bas indent1"><span class="nm">(e)</span><span class="cl">Answer #2:</span> "And all your Behemos" is an inclusion.</p>
<p class="bas indent1"><span class="nm">(f)</span><span class="cl">Question:</span> Does 'all' always denote an inclusion?!</p>
<p class="bas indent2"><span class="nm">1.</span>Regarding Ma'aser Sheni it says 'all', yet we expound regarding the method of Klal u'Frat!</p>
<p class="bas indent3"><span class="nm">i.</span><span class="cl">(Beraisa):</span> "You will spend the money on whatever your soul desires" - Klal; "on cattle, flock, wine and strong drink" - Prat; "and on all that your soul requests" - Klal;</p>
<p class="bas indent3"><span class="nm">ii.</span>From a Klal u'Frat u'Chlal we learn everything that is like the Prat - whatever reproduces and grows from the ground.</p>
<p class="bas indent1"><span class="nm">(g)</span><span class="cl">Answer #1:</span> "On all" is a Klal; 'all' is an inclusion.</p>
<p class="bas indent1"><span class="nm">(h)</span><span class="cl">Answer #2:</span> Normally, 'all' is a Klal; by Shabbos, it is an inclusion;</p>
<p class="bas indent2"><span class="nm">1.</span>This is because the Torah should have written "Your animals", just like it wrote regarding the first version; regarding adding "all", it comes as an inclusion.</p>
<p class="bas indent1"><span class="nm">(i)</span><span class="cl">Question:</span> What do we learn from "Behemah" of the first version and "ox and donkey" of the second version?</p>
<p class="bas indent1"><span class="nm">(j)</span><span class="cl">Answer:</span> Each is used for a Gezeirah Shavah (like above, 3:g,h,and i).</p>
<p class="bas indent1"><span class="nm">(k)</span><span class="cl">Question:</span> Since we learn the Isur of working with diverse species from Shabbos, man should be (like a different species and) forbidden to work with animals (since regarding Shabbos, slaves are equated to animals), but this is not so!</p>
<p class="bas indent2"><span class="nm">1.</span><span class="cl">(Mishnah):</span> Man may plow or pull with any animal.</p>
<p class="bas indent1"><span class="nm">(l)</span><span class="cl">Answer (Rav Papa):</span> "(You and your animals will not do Melachah...) in order that your slaves will rest like you" equates slaves to animals only regarding resting.</p>
