<div class="subject"><span class="nm">1)</span><p>REGULAR <i>CHATA'OS</i> (cont.)</p></div>
<div class="indent1"><span class="nm">(a)</span><p><span class="cl">(Continuation of Mishnah):</span> The blood must be put on each of the four Keranos;</p></div>
<div class="indent2"><span class="nm">1.</span><p>The Kohen ascends the ramp and walks (counterclockwise) on the Sovev (the walkway around the Mizbe'ach half-way up the Mizbe'ach), putting on each Keren when he comes to it, i.e. southeast, northeast, northwest and southwest;</p></div>
<div class="indent1"><span class="nm">(b)</span><p>He pours the Shirayim on the Yesod in the south;</p></div>
<div class="indent1"><span class="nm">(c)</span><p>Male Kohanim eat the meat within the hangings (of the Mishkan. This corresponds to the Azarah of the Beis ha'Mikdash), (raw or cooked) in any way, that day and until half the following night.</p></div>
<div class="indent1"><span class="nm">(d)</span><p><span class="cl">(Gemara) Question:</span> How is blood put on a Keren?</p></div>
<div class="indent1"><span class="nm">(e)</span><p><span class="cl">Answer #1 (R. Yochanan or R. Elazar):</span> He puts blood on one of the (two) outer faces of the Keren, i.e. within an Amah of the edge;</p></div>
<div class="indent1"><span class="nm">(f)</span><p><span class="cl">Answer #2 (The other of R. Yochanan and R. Elazar):</span> He puts it along the edge from the top down (until the Sovev).</p></div>
<div class="indent1"><span class="nm">(g)</span><p>R. Elazar b'Rebbi Shimon says that blood is put only on the Keren itself. Clearly, this is like Answer #1;</p></div>
<div class="indent1"><span class="nm">(h)</span><p>Rebbi permits putting blood below the Keren, as long as it is above the Sovev. This could be like either answer;</p></div>
<div class="indent2"><span class="nm">1.</span><p>Answer #1 allows putting the blood within an Amah of the edge (within an Amah of the edge is considered like the Keren). Rebbi could permit this even below the Keren;</p></div>
<div class="indent2"><span class="nm">2.</span><p>Answer #2 requires putting the blood of the edge, for only the edge is called 'Keren'.</p></div>
<div class="indent1"><span class="nm">(i)</span><p><span class="cl">Question (against Answer #1 - Beraisa):</span> To do Matanos Dam of (outer) Chata'os of the Tzibur or of a commoner, the Kohen ascends the ramp and walks on the Sovev to the southeast Keren;</p></div>
<div class="indent2"><span class="nm">1.</span><p>He immerses his right skilled (index) finger in the blood in the bucket, and uses his thumb and pinky to constrict the blood so all will go on the edge, until all the blood from his finger is finished;</p></div>
<div class="indent2"><span class="nm">2.</span><p>He does the same on every Keren.</p></div>
<div class="indent1"><span class="nm">(j)</span><p><span class="cl">Answer:</span> The first opinion <i>permits</i> putting the blood within an Amah of the edge. He admits that it is best to put it on the edge.</p></div>
<div class="subject"><span class="nm">2)</span><p>UPPER AND LOWER BLOOD</p></div>
<div class="indent1"><span class="nm">(a)</span><p><span class="cl">Question:</span> What is the argument of Rebbi and R. Elazar b'Rebbi Shimon?</p></div>
<div class="indent1"><span class="nm">(b)</span><p><span class="cl">Answer (Beraisa):</span> Upper blood (i.e. that should be put on the top of the Mizbe'ach) must be put above the Chut ha'Sikra (a red string separating the top and bottom halves of the Mizbe'ach). Lower blood must be put below the Chut ha'Sikra;</p></div>
<div class="indent1"><span class="nm">(c)</span><p>R. Elazar b'Rebbi Shimon says, the first clause is correct regarding Olas ha'Of, but blood of Chatas Behemah must be put on the Keranos.</p></div>
<div class="indent1"><span class="nm">(d)</span><p><span class="cl">(R. Avahu):</span> Rebbi learns from "veha'Har'el (the Mizbe'ach) Arba Amos ume'Ha'ari'el u'Lmalah ha'Keranos Arba".</p></div>
<div class="indent2"><span class="nm">1.</span><p><span class="cl">Objection:</span> The Mizbe'ach is more than four Amos! (It is 10 Amos tall and 32 Amos square)!</p></div>
<div class="indent2"><span class="nm">2.</span><p><span class="cl">Answer (Rav Ada bar Ahavah):</span> The Keranos occupy four Amos on each side of the Mizbe'ach.</p></div>
<div class="indent2"><span class="nm">3.</span><p><span class="cl">Objection:</span> They do not! (There are two Keranos on each side, and each occupies one Amah.)</p></div>
<div class="indent2"><span class="nm">4.</span><p><span class="cl">Correction:</span> Rather, the four Amos (from the bottom of the Keren down to the Chut ha'Sikra) are considered like the Keren.</p></div>
<div class="indent1"><span class="nm">(e)</span><p><span class="cl">(Mishnah):</span> A red string (the Chut ha'Sikra) girds the Mizbe'ach in the middle, to distinguish between (the place for) upper and lower blood.</p></div>
<div class="indent1"><span class="nm">(f)</span><p><span class="cl">Question:</span> What is the source of this?</p></div>
<div class="indent1"><span class="nm">(g)</span><p><span class="cl">Answer (Rav Acha bar Rav Katina):</span> "V'Haysah ha'Reshes Ad Chetzi ha'Mizbe'ach" - there must be a Mechitzah to distinguish between upper and lower blood.</p></div>
<div class="indent1"><span class="nm">(h)</span><p><span class="cl">(Mishnah):</span> The Shirayim...</p></div>
<div class="indent1"><span class="nm">(i)</span><p><span class="cl">(Beraisa):</span> (Shirayim of outer Chata'os are poured) "El Yesod ha'Mizbe'ach" - the southern Yesod;</p></div>
<div class="indent2"><span class="nm">1.</span><p><span class="cl">Question:</span> Perhaps it refers to the western Yesod! We learn what is unspecified (outer Chata'os) from the explicit (inner Chata'os. It says about them "Pesach Ohel Mo'ed.")</p></div>
<div class="indent2"><span class="nm">2.</span><p><span class="cl">Answer:</span> (Indeed, we learn from inner Chata'os, but differently.) Just like Shirayim of inner Chata'os are poured on the first Yesod encountered (after leaving the Heichal), Shirayim of outer Chata'os are poured on the first Yesod encountered (after descending from the ramp).</p></div>
<div class="indent1"><span class="nm">(j)</span><p><span class="cl">(Beraisa - R. Yishmael):</span> Shirayim of inner and outer Chata'os are poured on the western Yesod;</p></div>
<div class="indent1"><span class="nm">(k)</span><p>R. Shimon ben Yochai says, both are poured on the southern Yesod.</p></div>
<div class="indent1"><span class="nm">(l)</span><p><span class="cl">Question:</span> Granted, R. Yishmael learns what is Stam (unspecified) from what is explicit;</p></div>
<div class="indent2"><span class="nm">1.</span><p>What is R. Shimon's reason?</p></div>
<div class="indent1"><span class="nm">(m)</span><p><span class="cl">Version #1 - Answer (R. Asi):</span> He holds that the entire Mizbe'ach is north (of the opening to the Heichal; alternatively, it is in the north half of the Azarah. The south end of the Mizbe'ach is even with the middle of the opening);</p></div>
<div class="indent1"><span class="nm">(n)</span><p><span class="cl">Version #2 - Answer (R. Asi):</span> He holds that the entire opening to the Heichal is south of the Mizbe'ach; (end of Version #2)</p></div>
<div class="indent2"><span class="nm">1.</span><p>(One who leaves the Heichal (in the middle of the opening) encounters the southern side.)</p></div>
<div class="bbbline">53b----------------------------------------53b</p></div>
<div class="indent1"><span class="nm">(o)</span><p><span class="cl">Version #1 - our text, Rashi - (Beraisa - Talmidim of R. Yishmael):</span> R. Shimon agrees that both are poured on the western Yesod;</p></div>
<div class="indent2"><span class="nm">1.</span><p>A Siman (way to remember this) is 'the many (Talmidim) convinced the individual (R. Shimon) to retract.'</p></div>
<div class="indent1"><span class="nm">(p)</span><p><span class="cl">Version #2 - Tosfos - (Beraisa - Tana d'Vei R. Yishmael):</span> Both are poured on the southern Yesod.</p></div>
<div class="indent2"><span class="nm">1.</span><p>A Siman is 'the many (R. Shimon bar Yochai, who is called by his own name and his father's) convinced the individual (R. Yishmael) to retract.'</p></div>
<div class="subject"><span class="nm">3)</span><p>OFFERING THE <i>OLAH</i></p></div>
<div class="indent1"><span class="nm">(a)</span><p><span class="cl">(Mishnah):</span> Olah is Kodshei Kodoshim. It is slaughtered in Tzafon. Kabalah must be in a Keli Shares in Tzafon;</p></div>
<div class="indent1"><span class="nm">(b)</span><p>The blood must be thrown twice (or on two Keranos), which is effectively four Zerikos (this will be explained);</p></div>
<div class="indent1"><span class="nm">(c)</span><p>It must be flayed and dissected, it is Kalil (entirely burned on the Altar).</p></div>
<div class="indent1"><span class="nm">(d)</span><p><span class="cl">(Gemara) Question:</span> Why does the Mishnah mention that Olah is Kodshei Kodoshim?</p></div>
<div class="indent1"><span class="nm">(e)</span><p><span class="cl">Answer:</span> It must teach this because the Torah does not explicitly say that it is.</p></div>
<div class="indent1"><span class="nm">(f)</span><p><span class="cl">(Mishnah):</span> The blood must be thrown twice...</p></div>
<div class="indent1"><span class="nm">(g)</span><p><span class="cl">Question:</span> How is this done?</p></div>
<div class="indent1"><span class="nm">(h)</span><p><span class="cl">Answer #1 (Rav):</span> The Kohen puts on one side (of a corner), then on the other side (and then similarly for the opposite corner);</p></div>
<div class="indent1"><span class="nm">(i)</span><p><span class="cl">Answer #2 (Shmuel):</span> He throws the blood once (on each of two opposite corners) at the edge. It flows on both sides, like a (Greek) Gamma (an L shape).</p></div>
<div class="indent1"><span class="nm">(j)</span><p>Tana'im argue as Rav and Shmuel argue.</p></div>
<div class="indent2"><span class="nm">1.</span><p><span class="cl">(Beraisa) Suggestion:</span> Perhaps we do only one Zerikah (of Dam Olah).</p></div>
<div class="indent2"><span class="nm">2.</span><p><span class="cl">Rejection:</span> It says "Saviv" (the blood must go all around, i.e. on every side).</p></div>
<div class="indent2"><span class="nm">3.</span><p><span class="cl">Suggestion:</span> Perhaps we draw a line of blood all around (with the finger)!</p></div>
<div class="indent2"><span class="nm">4.</span><p><span class="cl">Rejection:</span> It says "v'Zarak";</p></div>
<div class="indent3"><span class="nm">i.</span><p><span class="cl">Conclusion:</span> He throws the blood on the edge (of two opposite Keranos). It flows on both sides, like a Gamma.</p></div>
<div class="indent2"><span class="nm">5.</span><p>R. Yishmael says, it says "Saviv", like it says regarding Chatas:</p></div>
<div class="indent3"><span class="nm">i.</span><p>Just like four distinct Matanos are done for Chatas, also regarding Olah.</p></div>
<div class="indent2"><span class="nm">6.</span><p><span class="cl">Suggestion:</span> Perhaps Matanos must be done on each of the four Keranos, similar to Chatas!</p></div>
<div class="indent2"><span class="nm">7.</span><p><span class="cl">Rejection:</span> This cannot be, for all Zerikos of Olah must be above the Yesod, and the southeast corner does not have a Yesod.</p></div>
<div class="indent2"><span class="nm">8.</span><p><span class="cl">Question:</span> Why doesn't it have a Yesod?</p></div>
<div class="indent2"><span class="nm">9.</span><p><span class="cl">Answer (R. Elazar):</span> This is because that place (where the Yesod would be if there was one) was not in the portion of Binyamin. (It was in Yehudah's portion. The (primary parts of the) Mizbe'ach must be in Binyamin's portion.)</p></div>
<div class="indent3"><span class="nm">i.</span><p><span class="cl">(Rav Shmuel bar Rav Yitzchak):</span> The Mizbe'ach occupied an Amah of Yehudah's portion.</p></div>
<div class="indent3"><span class="nm">ii.</span><p><span class="cl">(R. Levi bar Chama):</span> A strip of land extended from Yehudah's portion into Binyamin's, Binyamin (ben Yakov Avinu) was pained that his Shevet did not receive it (Maharsha - in order that the entire Mizbe'ach would have a Yesod) - "Chofef Alav Kol ha'Yom".</p></div>
<div class="indent3"><span class="nm">iii.</span><p>Therefore, Binyamin merited to become the host of Hash-m - "u'Vein Keseifav Shachen." (The order of events is difficult. Perhaps this means that Hash-m knew that Binyamin would feel more pain over this than any other Shevet, therefore he merited... Iyun Yakov - because Binyamin was pained, Hash-m made Binyamin His permanent host.)</p></div>
