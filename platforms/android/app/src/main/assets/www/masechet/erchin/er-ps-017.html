<p class="dedicationbox">ERCHIN 17 - Two weeks of study material have been dedicated by Mrs. Estanne Abraham Fawer to honor the twelfth Yahrzeit of her father, Rav Mordechai ben Eliezer Zvi (Rabbi Morton Weiner) Z'L, who passed away on 18 Teves 5760. May the merit of supporting and advancing Dafyomi study -- which was so important to him -- during the weeks of his Yahrzeit serve as an Iluy for his Neshamah. </p>

<div class="subject"><span class="nm">1)</span><p>AFFLICTIONS (cont.)</p></div>
<div class="indent1"><span class="nm">(a)</span><p><span class="cl">Question:</span> Why must we know what is considered Yesurim?</p></div>
<div class="indent1"><span class="nm">(b)</span><p><span class="cl">Answer #1 (Beraisa - Tana d'Vei R. Yishmael):</span> If someone did not experience Yesurim for 40 days, he has already received his share of the World to Come;</p></div>
<div class="indent1"><span class="nm">(c)</span><p><span class="cl">Answer #2 (Chachamim of Eretz Yisrael):</span> If someone did not experience Yesurim for 40 days, they are about to come upon him.</p></div>
<div class="indent1"><span class="nm">(d)</span><p><span class="cl">(Beraisa - R. Eliezer ha'Gadol):</span> Had Hash-m judged Avraham, Yitzchak and Yakov with the Midah of Din, they could not have stood the rebuke - "v'Atah Hisyatzvu v'Ishafta... Kol Tzidkos Hash-m Asher Asah Itchem v'Es Avoseichem."</p></div>
<div class="indent1"><span class="nm">(e)</span><p><span class="cl">(R. Yehudah Nesi'ah or Rabanan):</span> "Zeh Dor Dorshav Mevakshei Panecha... " - the Dor (generation) is like Dorshav (its leaders);</p></div>
<div class="indent1"><span class="nm">(f)</span><p><span class="cl">(The other of R. Yehudah Nesi'ah and Rabanan):</span> This teaches that the leaders are like the generation.</p></div>
<div class="indent1"><span class="nm">(g)</span><p><span class="cl">Question:</span> Regarding what is one like the other?</p></div>
<div class="indent2"><span class="nm">1.</span><p><span class="cl">Suggestion:</span> This refers to righteousness.</p></div>
<div class="indent2"><span class="nm">2.</span><p><span class="cl">Rejection:</span> Tzidkiyahu was a Tzadik leading a wicked generation, and Yehoyakim was a Rasha leading a righteous generation!</p></div>
<div class="indent2"><span class="nm">3.</span><p><span class="cl">Question (R. Yochanan):</span> Why does it say "b'Reishis Mamlechus Yehoyakim" and "b'Reishis Mamleches Tzidkiyahu"? (It does not say b'Reishis regarding other kings.)</p></div>
<div class="indent2"><span class="nm">4.</span><p><span class="cl">Answer:</span> Hash-m was ready to return the world to nothingness (like before creation) due to Yehoyakim. He did not, due to the generation; Hash-m was ready to return the world to nothingness due to Tzidkiyahu's generation. He did not, due to Tzidkiyahu.</p></div>
<div class="indent1"><span class="nm">(h)</span><p><span class="cl">Answer:</span> Both are harsh, or both are easily appeased.</p></div>
<div class="perekline">PEREK YESH B'ERCHIN</div>
<div class="subject"><span class="nm">2)</span><p>HESEG YAD</p></div>
<div class="indent1"><span class="nm">(a)</span><p><span class="cl">(Mishnah):</span> Heseg Yad (paying only according to what one can afford) is according to the Noder. The years (that determine the Erech) are according to the Nidar;</p></div>
<div class="indent1"><span class="nm">(b)</span><p>Erchin is according to (the gender of) the Ne'erach. The Erech is paid according to (the age at) the time of the Erech (vow).</p></div>
<div class="indent1"><span class="nm">(c)</span><p>Heseg Yad is according to the Noder. If an Oni was Ma'arich an Ashir, he pays the Erech of an Oni. If an Ashir was Ma'arich an Oni, he pays the full Erech, like an Ashir.</p></div>
<div class="indent1"><span class="nm">(d)</span><p>Korbanos are different;</p></div>
<div class="indent2"><span class="nm">1.</span><p>If Reuven said "Alai (it is upon me) to bring the Korbanos of Ploni the Metzora," if Ploni is an Oni, Reuven brings Korbanos of a Metzora Oni (birds in place of two of the animals). If Ploni is an Ashir, he brings Korbanos of an Ashir.</p></div>
<div class="indent1"><span class="nm">(e)</span><p>Rebbi says, the same applies to Erchin;</p></div>
<div class="indent2"><span class="nm">1.</span><p>If an Oni was Ma'arich an Ashir, he pays Erech Oni because the Ashir had no obligation;</p></div>
<div class="indent2"><span class="nm">2.</span><p>If an Ashir said "Erki Alai," and an Oni said "what he said is Alai," he pays Erech Ashir.</p></div>
<div class="indent1"><span class="nm">(f)</span><p><span class="cl">(Gemara) Question:</span> (Why does the Mishnah say that Heseg Yad is according to the <i>Noder</i>?) Heseg Yad applies only to a Ma'arich, but not to one who is Noder Damim!</p></div>
<div class="indent1"><span class="nm">(g)</span><p><span class="cl">Answer:</span> The Torah calls him a Noder - "Asher Tasig Yad ha'Noder... ."</p></div>
<div class="indent1"><span class="nm">(h)</span><p><span class="cl">Question:</span> (Why does the Mishnah say that the years are according to the Nidar?) Years affect only Erchin!</p></div>
<div class="indent1"><span class="nm">(i)</span><p><span class="cl">Answer:</span> Since it said that Heseg Yad is according to the Noder, it says that years are according to the Nidar (for parallel structure).</p></div>
<div class="indent1"><span class="nm">(j)</span><p><span class="cl">(Mishnah):</span> Heseg Yad is according to the Noder. If an Oni was Ma'arich an Ashir (Tosfos - the Ashir was Ma'arich, the Oni accepted on himself the obligation of the Ashir), he pays Erech Oni.</p></div>
<div class="indent1"><span class="nm">(k)</span><p><span class="cl">Question:</span> What is the reason?</p></div>
<div class="indent1"><span class="nm">(l)</span><p><span class="cl">Answer:</span> "Asher Tasig Yad ha'Noder... " teaches that Heseg Yad depends on the Noder.</p></div>
<div class="subject"><span class="nm">3)</span><p>ACCEPTING TO BRING SOMEONE ELSE'S KORBANOS</p></div>
<div class="indent1"><span class="nm">(a)</span><p><span class="cl">(Mishnah):</span> Korbanos are different. If Reuven said "Alai Korbanos Ploni Metzora," if Ploni is an Oni, Reuven brings Korbanos Metzora Oni.</p></div>
<div class="indent2"><span class="nm">1.</span><p><span class="cl">Assumption:</span> This is even if Reuven is an Ashir.</p></div>
<div class="indent1"><span class="nm">(b)</span><p><span class="cl">Question:</span> One brings Korbanos Metzora Oni only if he is poor -- "v'Im Dal Hu." Reuven is bringing the Korbanos. He is not an Oni!</p></div>
<div class="indent1"><span class="nm">(c)</span><p><span class="cl">Answer (R. Yitzchak):</span> (The assumption was wrong.) Reuven is an Oni.</p></div>
<div class="indent1"><span class="nm">(d)</span><p><span class="cl">Question:</span> Perhaps the Torah is merciful on a poor Metzora, but not on a Noder! (If one accepted to pay for Korbanos Metzora, he always brings Korbanos Ashir.)</p></div>
<div class="indent1"><span class="nm">(e)</span><p><span class="cl">Answer (Rav Ada bar Ahavah):</span> "V'Ein Yado Maseges" includes a Noder (in the Parshah of Korbanos Metzora Oni).</p></div>
<div class="indent1"><span class="nm">(f)</span><p><span class="cl">Question:</span> If a rich Noder brings Korbanos Ashir, why does the Mishnah say that Korbanos are different? Also a rich Ma'arich gives Erech Ashir! (We adopt the text that Rashi prefers.)</p></div>
<div class="bbbline">17b----------------------------------------17b</p></div>
<div class="indent1"><span class="nm">(g)</span><p><span class="cl">Answer:</span> Korbanos are different in one case, when an Oni accepted to pay for Korbanos Metzora of an Ashir. (He brings Korbanos Ashir. In the corresponding case of Erchin, he pays like an Oni);</p></div>
<div class="indent2"><span class="nm">1.</span><p>One might have thought that since we include a Noder (to bring Korbanos Metzora Oni), this applies whenever the Noder is an Oni. The Mishnah teaches that this is not so.</p></div>
<div class="indent2"><span class="nm">2.</span><p><span class="cl">(Beraisa) Suggestion:</span> If an Oni was Ma'arich an Ashir, he pays Erech Oni. Perhaps the same applies to an Oni who accepted to pay for Korbanos Metzora of an Ashir!</p></div>
<div class="indent2"><span class="nm">3.</span><p><span class="cl">Rejection:</span> "V'Im Dal Hu" (excludes when the Metzora is an Ashir).</p></div>
<div class="indent1"><span class="nm">(h)</span><p><span class="cl">Question:</span> According to Rebbi, Erchin are like Korbanos. (I f an Ashir said "Erki Alai," and an Oni said "what he said is Alai," he pays Erech Ashir.) We always follow the obligation of the Nidar. We do not need a verse to teach about when the Metzora is an Ashir;</p></div>
<div class="indent2"><span class="nm">1.</span><p>What does "v'Im Dal <i>Hu</i>" exclude?</p></div>
<div class="indent1"><span class="nm">(i)</span><p><span class="cl">Answer:</span> It excludes an Ashir who brings Korbanos for a Metzora Oni;</p></div>
<div class="indent2"><span class="nm">1.</span><p>One might have thought that since we always follow the obligation of the Nidar, he brings Korban Oni. The verse teaches that this is not so.</p></div>
<div class="subject"><span class="nm">4)</span><p>WHEN IS HESEG YAD DETERMINED?</p></div>
<div class="indent1"><span class="nm">(a)</span><p><span class="cl">(Mishnah):</span> If an Oni became rich, or an Ashir became poor, he pays like an Ashir;</p></div>
<div class="indent1"><span class="nm">(b)</span><p>R. Yehudah says, even if he was poor, became rich, and later became poor again, he pays Erech Ashir.</p></div>
<div class="indent1"><span class="nm">(c)</span><p>The law of Korbanos is different. Even if Ploni's father died and he inherited a fortune, or Ploni is about to receive a fortune when his ship comes in, he brings Korban Oni.</p></div>
<div class="indent1"><span class="nm">(d)</span><p>(Gemara) If an Oni became rich, he pays like an Ashir. It says "Asher Tasig Yad ha'Noder," and now he has money;</p></div>
<div class="indent2"><span class="nm">1.</span><p>If an Ashir became poor, he pays like an Ashir - "<i>Al Pi</i> Asher Tasig Yad ha'Noder," according to his wealth when he vowed.</p></div>
<div class="indent1"><span class="nm">(e)</span><p><span class="cl">(Mishnah - R. Yehudah):</span> Even if he was poor, became rich, and later became poor again, he pays Erech Ashir.</p></div>
<div class="indent1"><span class="nm">(f)</span><p><span class="cl">Question:</span> What is R. Yehudah's reason?</p></div>
<div class="indent1"><span class="nm">(g)</span><p><span class="cl">Answer:</span> "V'Im Mach Hu me'Erkecha" teaches that Heseg Yad applies only if he was Mach (poor) from the beginning (when he vowed the Erech) until the end.</p></div>
<div class="indent1"><span class="nm">(h)</span><p><span class="cl">Question #1:</span> If so, he should expound also "v'Im Dal Hu" to teach that Korban Metzora Oni is only if he was poor from the beginning until the end! (Presumably, "from the beginning" is when he first became obligated to bring Korbanos, i.e. when he became Muchlat.)</p></div>
<div class="indent2"><span class="nm">1.</span><p><span class="cl">Suggestion:</span> Perhaps that is correct!</p></div>
<div class="indent2"><span class="nm">2.</span><p><span class="cl">Rejection (Mishnah - R. Shimon):</span> If a Metzora brought (some of) the Korbanos Metzora of an Oni and then became rich, or vice-versa, we only consider his wealth at the time he brings the Chatas. (If he was poor and brought Chatas ha'Of, he brings also Olas ha'Of);</p></div>
<div class="indent2"><span class="nm">3.</span><p>R. Yehudah says, it is determined at the time he brings the Asham.</p></div>
<div class="indent2"><span class="nm">4.</span><p><span class="cl">(Beraisa - R. Eliezer ben Yakov):</span> It is determined at the time he brings birds (before shaving. No Tana says that he must be poor from the beginning!)</p></div>
<div class="indent1"><span class="nm">(i)</span><p><span class="cl">Answer:</span> Rav Yehudah taught that all these Tana'im learn from a verse - "Asher Lo Tasig Yado b'Taharaso";</p></div>
<div class="indent2"><span class="nm">1.</span><p>R. Shimon holds that "b'Taharaso" refers to what is Mechaper, i.e. the Chatas;</p></div>
<div class="indent2"><span class="nm">2.</span><p>R. Yehudah holds that it refers to what is Machshir (the Metzora to enter the Mikdash and eat Kodshim), i.e. the Asham;</p></div>
<div class="indent2"><span class="nm">3.</span><p>R. Eliezer ben Yakov holds that it refers to what causes him to be Tahor (allows him to shave and enter the city), i.e. the birds.</p></div>
<div class="indent1"><span class="nm">(j)</span><p><span class="cl">Question:</span> What do we learn from "v'Im Dal <i>Hu</i>"?</p></div>
<div class="indent1"><span class="nm">(k)</span><p><span class="cl">Answer:</span> Rebbi uses it to exclude an Ashir bringing for a Metzora Oni, and Chachamim use it to exclude one who brings for a Metzora Ashir.</p></div>
<div class="indent1"><span class="nm">(l)</span><p><span class="cl">Question #2:</span> If so, he should also expound "v'Hu Ed" to teach that a witness must be Kosher (to testify) from the beginning (when he saw the testimony) until the end (when he testifies)!</p></div>
<div class="indent2"><span class="nm">1.</span><p><span class="cl">Suggestion:</span> Perhaps that is correct!</p></div>
<div class="indent2"><span class="nm">2.</span><p><span class="cl">Rejection (Beraisa):</span> If Reuven knew testimony about Shimon, then he became (Pasul for testimony, e.g. he became) his father-in-law, deaf, blind, or insane, he cannot testify;</p></div>
<div class="indent2"><span class="nm">3.</span><p>If he was a Kosher witness when he saw the testimony, then he became Pasul, and later became Kosher again (his daughter died, so he is no longer related, or he regained his hearing, sight or sanity), he can testify.</p></div>
<div class="indent2"><span class="nm">4.</span><p>The general rule is, if he was Pasul at the beginning (when he saw the testimony) or the end (when he wants to testify), he cannot testify. If he was Kosher at the beginning and at the end, he can testify.</p></div>
