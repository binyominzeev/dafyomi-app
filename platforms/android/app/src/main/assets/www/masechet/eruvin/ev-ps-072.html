<div class="subject"><span class="nm">1)</span><p>DO WE NEED BOTH <i>SHITUF</i> AND <i>ERUV CHATZEROS</i>? (cont.)</p></div>
<div class="indent1"><span class="nm">(a)</span><p><span class="cl">Question (against the latter opinion - Beraisa - Chachamim):</span> We make an Eruv or a Shituf.</p></div>
<div class="indent2"><span class="nm">1.</span><p><span class="cl">Suggestion:</span> We make Eruv Chatzeros with bread, or Shituf Mavo'os with wine [and it permits the Chatzeros]!</p></div>
<div class="indent1"><span class="nm">(b)</span><p><span class="cl">Answer (Rav Gidal):</span> It means that we make Eruv Chatzeros with bread, and this permits also the Mavoy; or, we make Shituf Mavo'os with bread, and this permits also the Chatzeros.</p></div>
<div class="indent1"><span class="nm">(c)</span><p><span class="cl">(Rav Yehudah):</span> The Halachah follows R. Meir;</p></div>
<div class="indent1"><span class="nm">(d)</span><p><span class="cl">(Rav Huna):</span> The custom follows R. Meir;</p></div>
<div class="indent1"><span class="nm">(e)</span><p><span class="cl">(R. Yochanan):</span> People follow R. Meir [and we do not protest. Even though R. Meir is stringent, there are cases when it leads to a leniency. Also, according to Chachamim, the Berachah on the Eruv is in vain.]</p></div>
<div class="subject"><span class="nm">2)</span><p>GROUPS THAT LODGED IN ONE HALL</p></div>
<div class="indent1"><span class="nm">(a)</span><p><span class="cl">(Mishnah):</span> If five groups spent Shabbos in a hall (paltry Mechitzos separate them; each has its own opening from the hall to the Chatzer):</p></div>
<div class="indent2"><span class="nm">1.</span><p>Beis Shamai say that [each group is considered a separate Reshus, so they need an Eruv to transfer among each other.] Each must be Me'arev (give towards the Eruv in the Chatzer);</p></div>
<div class="indent2"><span class="nm">2.</span><p>Beis Hillel say that [they are considered one Reshus, so they may transfer among themselves without an Eruv.] It suffices for one of them to be Me'arev [in the Chatzer].</p></div>
<div class="indent1"><span class="nm">(b)</span><p>Beis Hillel agree that if they are in rooms or attics that each must be Me'arev.</p></div>
<div class="indent1"><span class="nm">(c)</span><p><span class="cl">Version #1 (Gemara - Rav Nachman):</span> They argue about when Mesifos (low flimsy walls, or walls with many windows) divide them. If walls 10 Tefachim tall divide them, all agree that each must be Me'arev;</p></div>
<div class="indent1"><span class="nm">(d)</span><p><span class="cl">Version #2 (Rav Nachman):</span> They argue even when Mesifos divide them.</p></div>
<div class="indent1"><span class="nm">(e)</span><p><span class="cl">(R. Chiya or R. Shimon bar Rebbi):</span> They argue about when walls up to the ceiling divide them. If the walls do not reach the ceiling, all agree that it suffices for one of them to be Me'arev;</p></div>
<div class="indent1"><span class="nm">(f)</span><p><span class="cl">(The other of R. Chiya and R. Shimon bar Rebbi):</span> They argue about walls that do not reach the ceiling. If they reach the ceiling, all agree that each must be Me'arev.</p></div>
<div class="bbbline">72b----------------------------------------72b</p></div>
<div class="indent1"><span class="nm">(g)</span><p><span class="cl">Question (Beraisa - R. Yehudah ha'Savar):</span> Beis Shamai and Beis Hillel agree that if the walls reach the ceiling, each must be Me'arev;</p></div>
<div class="indent2"><span class="nm">1.</span><p>They argue about walls that do not reach the ceiling. Beis Shamai requires each to be Me'arev, and Beis Hillel require only one;</p></div>
<div class="indent2"><span class="nm">2.</span><p>This supports the latter opinion of R. Chiya or R. Shimon and refutes the former. It also refutes Version #1 of Rav Nachman;</p></div>
<div class="indent2"><span class="nm">3.</span><p><span class="cl">Suggestion:</span> This refutes also Version #2 of Rav Nachman! (The Beraisa says that they argue about [proper] walls that do not reach the ceiling. This implies that all agree that Mesifos do not require each to be Me'arev.)</p></div>
<div class="indent1"><span class="nm">(h)</span><p><span class="cl">Answer (for Version #2 of Rav Nachman):</span> No, they argue about [proper] walls [that do not reach the ceiling] and also about Mesifos;</p></div>
<div class="indent2"><span class="nm">1.</span><p>The Tana taught the argument about walls to teach the extremity of Beis Hillel. (Even regarding walls, sometimes one Eruv suffices.)</p></div>
<div class="indent1"><span class="nm">(i)</span><p><span class="cl">Question:</span> Why didn't he teach the argument about Mesifos to teach the extremity of Beis Shamai?</p></div>
<div class="indent1"><span class="nm">(j)</span><p><span class="cl">Answer:</span> The Tana prefers to teach the extremity of the lenient opinion.</p></div>
<div class="indent1"><span class="nm">(k)</span><p><span class="cl">(Rav Nachman):</span> The Halachah follows R. Yehudah ha'Savar.</p></div>
<div class="indent1"><span class="nm">(l)</span><p><span class="cl">Support (Rav Nachman bar Yitzchak - Mishnah):</span> Beis Hillel agree that if they are in rooms or attics, each must be Me'arev.</p></div>
<div class="indent2"><span class="nm">1.</span><p><span class="cl">Question:</span> What kind of rooms or attics are these?</p></div>
<div class="indent3"><span class="nm">i.</span><p><span class="cl">Suggestion:</span> They are proper rooms or attics. (They were separate from the beginning.)</p></div>
<div class="indent3"><span class="nm">ii.</span><p><span class="cl">Rejection:</span> If so, obviously each must be Me'arev!</p></div>
<div class="indent2"><span class="nm">2.</span><p><span class="cl">Answer:</span> They are like rooms or attics, i.e. [temporary] walls that reach the ceiling.</p></div>
<div class="indent1"><span class="nm">(m)</span><p><span class="cl">Version #1 (Beraisa):</span> The argument [in the Mishnah] is when the groups in the hall bring their Eruv elsewhere (to a different house in the Chatzer. Beis Hillel say that one group is Me'arev on behalf of all of them, and Beis Shamai require each to be Me'arev);</p></div>
<div class="indent2"><span class="nm">1.</span><p>If the rest of the Chatzer brought their Eruv to the hall, all agree that one Eruv suffices. (Tosfos R. Peretz - the groups are like one house hosting the Eruv, so they need not be Me'arev.)</p></div>
<div class="indent1"><span class="nm">(n)</span><p><span class="cl">Question:</span> Who is the Tana of the following Beraisa?</p></div>
<div class="indent2"><span class="nm">1.</span><p><span class="cl">(Beraisa):</span> If five members of a Chatzer were Me'arev, one of them can take the Eruv elsewhere [to join with another Chatzer].</p></div>
<div class="indent1"><span class="nm">(o)</span><p><span class="cl">Answer:</span> It is like Beis Hillel.</p></div>
<div class="indent1"><span class="nm">(p)</span><p><span class="cl">Version #2 (Beraisa):</span> The argument is when the rest of the Chatzer brought their Eruv to the hall. If the groups brought their Eruv elsewhere, all agree that each must be Me'arev.</p></div>
<div class="indent1"><span class="nm">(q)</span><p><span class="cl">Question:</span> Who is the Tana of the following Beraisa?</p></div>
<div class="indent2"><span class="nm">1.</span><p><span class="cl">(Beraisa):</span> If five members of a Chatzer were Me'arev, one of them can take the Eruv elsewhere.</p></div>
<div class="indent1"><span class="nm">(r)</span><p><span class="cl">Answer:</span> It is not like either Tana.</p></div>
<div class="subject"><span class="nm">3)</span><p>WHAT DETERMINES RESIDENCE?</p></div>
<div class="indent1"><span class="nm">(a)</span><p><span class="cl">(Mishnah):</span> If brothers eat at their father's table and sleep in their own houses, each of them must be Me'arev. Therefore, if one of them forgot to be Me'arev, he must be Mevatel his Reshus [to permit the others];</p></div>
<div class="indent1"><span class="nm">(b)</span><p>This is when they put their Eruv in another house [in the Chatzer]. If the rest of the Chatzer brought their Eruv to the father's house, or if no one else lives in the Chatzer, they need not be Me'arev.</p></div>
<div class="indent1"><span class="nm">(c)</span><p><span class="cl">(Gemara) Inference:</span> The place of sleeping determines [residence. This refutes Rav (73a)]!</p></div>
<div class="indent1"><span class="nm">(d)</span><p><span class="cl">Rejection (Rav Yehudah):</span> The case is, they receive Pras (Tosfos 79B v'Al - food; Rashi - money for food) from their father [but eat in their own houses].</p></div>
<div class="indent1"><span class="nm">(e)</span><p><span class="cl">(Beraisa):</span> A Beis Sha'ar (gatehouse), Achsadra (a room open on one side) or balcony open to another's Chatzer does not forbid;</p></div>
<div class="indent1"><span class="nm">(f)</span><p>The following forbid - a storehouse for straw, wood or other things, or a cattle pen;</p></div>
<div class="indent1"><span class="nm">(g)</span><p>R. Yehudah says, only a place of Dirah forbids;</p></div>
<div class="indent1"><span class="nm">(h)</span><p>R. Yehudah says, a case occurred in which Ben Nafcha had (Me'iri - houses in) five Chatzeros in Usha. Chachamim said that only Beis Dirah forbids.</p></div>
<div class="indent1"><span class="nm">(i)</span><p><span class="cl">Objection:</span> This cannot be! (Tosfos ha'Rosh - he connotes that Beis Dirah forbids even if no one dwells in it. Me'iri - a Beis Sha'ar does not forbid, even if one lives there!)</p></div>
<div class="indent1"><span class="nm">(j)</span><p><span class="cl">Correction:</span> Rather, they said that only Mekom Dirah forbids. (Tosfos ha'Rosh -someone actually dwells there, Me'iri it is a place appropriate for Dirah.)</p></div>
<div class="indent1"><span class="nm">(k)</span><p><span class="cl">Question:</span> What is the place of Dirah?</p></div>
<div class="indent1"><span class="nm">(l)</span><p><span class="cl">Answer #1 (Rav):</span> It is where he eats.</p></div>
