<div class="subject"><span class="nm">1)</span><p>WHEN IS ONE LIABLE FOR TUM'AH?</p></div>
<div class="indent1"><span class="nm">(a)</span><p><span class="cl">Question:</span> Reish Lakish needs the verse to teach about a Tamei who ate Kodesh before Zerikah!</p></div>
<div class="indent2"><span class="nm">1.</span><p><span class="cl">(Reish Lakish):</span> If a Tamei ate Kodesh before Zerikah, he is lashed;</p></div>
<div class="indent3"><span class="nm">i.</span><p>He learns from "b'Chol Kodesh Lo Siga" - before or after Zerikah;</p></div>
<div class="indent2"><span class="nm">2.</span><p><span class="cl">(R. Yochanan):</span> He is not lashed;</p></div>
<div class="indent3"><span class="nm">i.</span><p><span class="cl">(Bardela - Beraisa):</span> We learn "Tum'aso- Tum'aso" from a Tamei who entered the Mikdash. Just like that is Chayavei Kerisus and a verse forbids it, also a Tamei who eats Kodesh;</p></div>
<div class="indent3"><span class="nm">ii.</span><p>We learn about eating Kodesh <i>after</i> Zerikah, for that is Chayavei Kerisus, like entering the Mikdash.</p></div>
<div class="indent1"><span class="nm">(b)</span><p><span class="cl">Answer:</span> Had it said 'b'Kodesh Lo Siga...", Reish Lakish would learn only after Zerikah;</p></div>
<div class="indent2"><span class="nm">1.</span><p>Rather, it says "b'Chol Kodesh..." to include before Zerikah.</p></div>
<div class="indent1"><span class="nm">(c)</span><p><span class="cl">(Abaye):</span> Reish Lakish and R. Yochanan argue about Tum'as Guf (a Tamei who ate Kodshim), but they agree that he is lashed for Tum'as Basar (the Kodesh is Tamei);</p></div>
<div class="indent2"><span class="nm">1.</span><p><span class="cl">(Beraisa):</span> "Veha'Basar" includes wood and frankincense (even though they are not foods, they are Mekabel Tum'ah due to Chibas ha'Kodesh (the dearness of Kodshim). One who eats them when they are Tamei is liable. All the more so, one who eats Tamei meat before Zerikah is liable!)</p></div>
<div class="indent1"><span class="nm">(d)</span><p><span class="cl">(Rava):</span> They argue about Tum'as Guf, but they agree that he is exempt for Tum'as Basar;</p></div>
<div class="indent2"><span class="nm">1.</span><p>Since "(veha'Nefesh Asher Tochal)... v'Tumaso Alav v'Nichresah" does not apply before Zerikah (there is no Kares), also "veha'Basar Asher Yiga b'Chol Tamei Lo Ye'achel" does not apply.</p></div>
<div class="indent1"><span class="nm">(e)</span><p><span class="cl">Question (Beraisa):</span> "Veha'Basar" includes wood and frankincense.</p></div>
<div class="indent1"><span class="nm">(f)</span><p><span class="cl">Answer:</span> The case is, it was Mekudash in a Keli. This is like offering all the Matirim;</p></div>
<div class="indent2"><span class="nm">1.</span><p><span class="cl">(Mishnah):</span> If something becomes permitted through offering Matirim (e.g. Zerikas Dam permits eating the meat), one is liable for eating it b'Tum'ah after the Matirim are offered;</p></div>
<div class="indent2"><span class="nm">2.</span><p>If something has no Matirim (e.g. a Kometz or frankincense), one is liable for eating it b'Tum'ah after it is Mekudash by putting it in a Keli Shares.</p></div>
<div class="subject"><span class="nm">2)</span><p>OFFERING OTHER ANIMALS</p></div>
<div class="indent1"><span class="nm">(a)</span><p><span class="cl">Version #1 (Reish Lakish):</span> If one offers limbs of a Tamei animal on the Mizbe'ach, he is lashed;</p></div>
<div class="indent2"><span class="nm">1.</span><p>It is an Aseh to offer Tahor animals. From this we infer a Lav not to offer Tamei animals. One is lashed for a Lav inferred from an Aseh.</p></div>
<div class="indent1"><span class="nm">(b)</span><p><span class="cl">(R. Yochanan):</span> He is not lashed;</p></div>
<div class="indent2"><span class="nm">1.</span><p>He holds that one is not lashed for a Lav inferred from an Aseh.</p></div>
<div class="indent1"><span class="nm">(c)</span><p><span class="cl">Question (against Reish Lakish - R. Yirmeyah - Beraisa):</span> "Osah (an animal with split hooves that chews the cud) Tochelu", but not other animals;</p></div>
<div class="indent1"><span class="nm">(d)</span><p><span class="cl">Version #2 (R. Yakov):</span> Reish Lakish and R. Yochanan agree that one is not lashed for offering limbs of a Tamei animal;</p></div>
<div class="indent2"><span class="nm">1.</span><p>They argue about offering a Chayah:</p></div>
<div class="indent2"><span class="nm">2.</span><p><span class="cl">(R. Yochanan):</span> One who offers a Chayah transgresses an Aseh;</p></div>
<div class="indent2"><span class="nm">3.</span><p>It is an Aseh to offer Behemos. We infer an Isur (Aseh) not to offer Chayos;</p></div>
<div class="indent2"><span class="nm">4.</span><p><span class="cl">(Reish Lakish):</span> He does not transgress anything;</p></div>
<div class="indent3"><span class="nm">i.</span><p>It is a Mitzvah to offer Behemos. It is Reshus (neither a Mitzvah nor an Aveirah) to offer Chayos.</p></div>
<div class="indent1"><span class="nm">(e)</span><p><span class="cl">Question (Rava - Beraisa):</span> Had it said 'Korban la'Shem Behemah', this would include Chayos;</p></div>
<div class="indent2"><span class="nm">1.</span><p>We find that "Behemah" includes Chayos - "Zos ha'Behemah... wild goat and deer...";</p></div>
<div class="indent2"><span class="nm">2.</span><p>Therefore, it says "Bakar" and "Tzon", to exclude Chayos.</p></div>
<div class="indent2"><span class="nm">3.</span><p><span class="cl">Suggestion:</span> Perhaps one should not bring Chayos, but if he did, it is Kosher!</p></div>
<div class="indent3"><span class="nm">i.</span><p>This is like a Talmid whose Rebbi told him 'bring to me wheat', and he brought wheat and barley. He did not transgress the command, he added to it;</p></div>
<div class="indent2"><span class="nm">4.</span><p><span class="cl">Rejection:</span> "Bakar" and "Tzon" are repeated to exclude a Chayah (even b'Di'eved, it is Pasul);</p></div>
<div class="indent3"><span class="nm">i.</span><p>This is like a Rebbi who said 'bring to me <i>only</i> wheat', and the Talmid brought wheat and barley. He did not add to the command. He transgressed it.</p></div>

<div class="subject"><span class="nm">3)</span><p>WHAT MAKES <i>SHIRAYIM</i>?</p></div>
<div class="indent1"><span class="nm">(a)</span><p><span class="cl">(Mishnah):</span> If any of these Pesulim was Mekabel...</p></div>
<div class="indent1"><span class="nm">(b)</span><p><span class="cl">Version #1 - Question (Reish Lakish):</span> If a Pasul did Zerikah, does he make (the remaining blood in the animal) Shirayim? (Shirayim usually refers to the blood remaining after the required Zerikos were done. Here it means 'useless', i.e. do we say that the Korban is already Pasul?)</p></div>
<div class="indent1"><span class="nm">(c)</span><p><span class="cl">Answer (R. Yochanan):</span> He makes Shirayim only if he was Zorek with intent Chutz li'Zmano or Chutz li'Mkomo, since this takes effect to make the Korban Pigul or Pasul.</p></div>
<div class="indent1"><span class="nm">(d)</span><p><span class="cl">Version #2 (Rav Zevid) Question (Reish Lakish):</span> If a bucket of blood became Pasul (e.g. it left the Azarah), if it is Nizrak, does it make Shirayim?</p></div>
<div class="indent1"><span class="nm">(e)</span><p><span class="cl">Answer (R. Yochanan):</span> This has the same law as a Pasul who was Zorek. If one makes Shirayim, also the other.</p></div>
<div class="indent1"><span class="nm">(f)</span><p><span class="cl">Version #3 (R. Yirmeyah mi'Difti) Question (Abaye):</span> If Kabalah was done in two buckets, if one of them is thrown on the Mizbe'ach, does it make the other Shirayim (and it is poured on the Yesod of the Mizbe'ach), or does it make it Dachuy (Pasul even for the Yesod. It must be spilled into the Amah, i.e. a channel that leaves the Azarah)?</p></div>
<div class="indent1"><span class="nm">(g)</span><p><span class="cl">Answer (Rabah):</span> R. Elazar b'Rebbi Shimon and Chachamim argue about this;</p></div>
<div class="indent2"><span class="nm">1.</span><p><span class="cl">(Beraisa):</span> It says "v'Es Damo Yishpoch", and it says "v'Es <i>Kol</i> Damah Yishpoch";</p></div>
<div class="indent3"><span class="nm">i.</span><p>If Kabalah of blood of a Chatas was done in four buckets, and blood from each of them was put on a Keren (top corner) of the Mizbe'ach, the remaining blood in all the buckets is poured on the Yesod - "v'Es Kol Damah Yishpoch";</p></div>
<div class="indent3"><span class="nm">ii.</span><p><span class="cl">Suggestion:</span> If the blood was received in four buckets, and blood was put on all the Keranos from one of them, perhaps all the remaining blood is poured on the Yesod!</p></div>
<div class="indent3"><span class="nm">iii.</span><p><span class="cl">Rejection:</span> "V'Es Damo Yishpoch" (not all the blood) - the remaining blood from the one bucket (from which blood was put) is poured on the Yesod, and the others are poured into the Amah.</p></div>
<div class="indent2"><span class="nm">2.</span><p>R. Elazar b'Rebbi Shimon says, even in the latter case, all the remaining blood is poured on the Yesod - "v'Es Kol Damah Yishpoch."</p></div>
<div class="indent2"><span class="nm">3.</span><p><span class="cl">Question:</span> What does he learn from "v'Es Damo Yishpoch"?</p></div>
<div class="indent2"><span class="nm">4.</span><p><span class="cl">Answer (Rav Ashi):</span> The remaining blood in the animal is not poured on the Yesod.</p></div>
<div class="subject"><span class="nm">4)</span><p>DICHUY</p></div>
<div class="indent1"><span class="nm">(a)</span><p><span class="cl">(Mishnah):</span> If a Kosher Kohen did Kabalah and gave it to a Pasul...</p></div>
<div class="indent1"><span class="nm">(b)</span><p>The Mishnah must teach all three cases.</p></div>
<div class="indent2"><span class="nm">1.</span><p>Had it taught only giving it to a Pasul, one might have thought that this refers only to a Tamei, for he is Kosher for Avodas Tzibur (if no Tahor Kohen is available), but if it was transferred to the left hand, the Korban is Pasul;</p></div>
<div class="indent2"><span class="nm">2.</span><p>Had it taught only transferring to the left hand, one might have thought that this can be fixed because the left hand is used for Avodah on Yom Kipur, but if it was put into a Chulin Keli, the Korban is Pasul;</p></div>
<div class="indent2"><span class="nm">3.</span><p>Had it taught only putting into a Chulin Keli, one might have thought that this can be fixed because one could Makdish the Keli, but other Pesulim (which cannot be fixed) would disqualify the Korban.</p></div>
<div class="indent1"><span class="nm">(c)</span><p><span class="cl">Question:</span> We should say that Dichuy applies! (The blood could not be offered while the Pasul (or left hand or Chulin Keli) was holding it.)</p></div>
<div class="indent1"><span class="nm">(d)</span><p><span class="cl">Answer #1 (Ravina citing Rava):</span> Our Mishnah is like Chanan ha'Mitzri, who says that Dichuy does not apply even to a slaughtered animal.</p></div>
<div class="indent2"><span class="nm">1.</span><p><span class="cl">(Beraisa - Chanan ha'Mitzri):</span> If the goat sent to Azazel (on Yom Kipur) died after slaughtering the goat selected for Hash-m, we find another goat to send to Azazel.</p></div>
<div class="indent1"><span class="nm">(e)</span><p><span class="cl">Answer #2 (Rav Ashi):</span> (All agree with our Mishnah.) Whenever we can (Tosfos - should) remedy the situation, Dichuy does not apply.</p></div>
<div class="indent1"><span class="nm">(f)</span><p><span class="cl">Support (Rav Shiya):</span> R. Yehudah says that Dichuy applies... (this will be continued)</p></div>
<div class="indent2"><span class="nm">1.</span><p><span class="cl">(Mishnah - R. Yehudah):</span> If the goat selected for Hash-m was slaughtered and the blood spilled, the goat selected for Azazel must die (and two new goats are taken). If the goat selected for Azazel died, we spill the blood of the slaughtered goat.</p></div>
<div class="indent1"><span class="nm">(g)</span><p><span class="cl">(Continuation of support):</span> Even R. Yehudah agrees that when Dichuy can be fixed, it does not apply!</p></div>
<div class="indent2"><span class="nm">1.</span><p><span class="cl">(Beraisa - R. Yehudah):</span> (After the Korbanos Pesach were offered,) they would gather a bucket from the blood on the floor from all the Korbanos and throw it on the Mizbe'ach, to be Machshir a Korban (in case its blood spilled).</p></div>
<div class="indent2"><span class="nm">2.</span><p><span class="cl">Chachamim:</span> The blood fell (straight from the animal,) without Kabalah in a Keli! (It does not help to gather it from the floor.)</p></div>
<div class="indent2"><span class="nm">3.</span><p><span class="cl">Question:</span> How do Chachamim know this?!</p></div>
<div class="indent2"><span class="nm">4.</span><p><span class="cl">Correction - Chachamim:</span> Perhaps there was no Kabalah in a Keli!</p></div>
<div class="indent2"><span class="nm">5.</span><p><span class="cl">R. Yehudah:</span> We do this because (at least some of) the blood was received in a Keli (and later spilled).</p></div>
<div class="indent2"><span class="nm">6.</span><p><span class="cl">Question:</span> How does R. Yehudah know this?!</p></div>
<div class="indent2"><span class="nm">7.</span><p><span class="cl">Answer:</span> Kohanim are zealous. (Surely they received it.)</p></div>
<div class="indent2"><span class="nm">8.</span><p><span class="cl">(Text of Shitah Mekubetzes - Question:</span> If so, why did it spill?</p></div>
<div class="indent2"><span class="nm">9.</span><p><span class="cl">Answer:</span> Because they are zealous,) they work quickly. Therefore, it spilled.</p></div>
