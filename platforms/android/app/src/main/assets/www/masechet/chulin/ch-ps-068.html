<div class="indent1"><span class="nm">(a)</span><p><span class="cl">(Mishnah):</span> If an animal was slaughtered when it was giving birth, and the fetus stuck out a leg (from the womb) and returned it, it may be eaten;</p></div>
<div class="indent2"><span class="nm">1.</span><p>If it stuck out its head, even if it returned it, it is as if the fetus was born.</p></div>
<div class="indent1"><span class="nm">(b)</span><p>If one cut a piece from a fetus (and left it) inside, it may be eaten (after the mother is slaughtered);</p></div>
<div class="indent2"><span class="nm">1.</span><p>If one cut a piece from the spleen or kidneys, it is forbidden (even after Shechitah).</p></div>
<div class="indent2"><span class="nm">2.</span><p>The rule is, something that is part of the animal is forbidden. If it is not part of the animal, it is permitted.</p></div>
<div class="indent1"><span class="nm">(c)</span><p><span class="cl">(Gemara - Rav Yehudah):</span> The leg that left the womb may not be eaten.</p></div>
<div class="indent2"><span class="nm">1.</span><p>"Meat torn in the field you may not eat" (permanently) forbids meat that left its proper place.</p></div>
<div class="indent1"><span class="nm">(d)</span><p><span class="cl">Question (Mishnah):</span> If the fetus stuck out a leg and returned it, it may be eaten.</p></div>
<div class="indent2"><span class="nm">1.</span><p><span class="cl">Suggestion:</span> 'It' refers to the leg. It may be eaten!</p></div>
<div class="indent1"><span class="nm">(e)</span><p><span class="cl">Answer:</span> No, it refers to the rest of the fetus.</p></div>
<div class="indent1"><span class="nm">(f)</span><p><span class="cl">Question:</span> The rest of the fetus is permitted even if the leg was not returned. Why did the Mishnah say that the leg was returned?</p></div>
<div class="indent1"><span class="nm">(g)</span><p><span class="cl">Answer:</span> This is for parallel structure with the Seifa:</p></div>
<div class="indent2"><span class="nm">1.</span><p><span class="cl">(Seifa):</span> If it stuck out its head, even if it returned it, it is as if it was born.</p></div>
<div class="indent1"><span class="nm">(h)</span><p><span class="cl">Question:</span> Why must our Mishnah teach that? Another Mishnah teaches that!</p></div>
<div class="indent2"><span class="nm">1.</span><p><span class="cl">(Mishnah):</span> A man can be a Bechor (firstborn) regarding inheritance (to receive a double portion), but not a Bechor regarding (the Mitzvah to redeem him by giving five Shekalim to) a Kohen:</p></div>
<div class="indent3"><span class="nm">i.</span><p>This is if he was born after a Nefel (non-viable baby), even if the Nefel stuck its head out alive, or after a viable baby (that was in the womb for nine months) that stuck its head out after it already died.</p></div>
<div class="indent3"><span class="nm">ii.</span><p><span class="cl">Inference:</span> If the first baby was viable and stuck its head out alive (and later died), the next child would not be a Bechor even regarding inheritance (because the first child was considered born)!</p></div>
<div class="indent2"><span class="nm">2.</span><p><span class="cl">Suggestion:</span> Our Mishnah teaches about animals. That Mishnah teaches about people.</p></div>
<div class="indent3"><span class="nm">i.</span><p>We cannot learn about people from animals, for animals do not have a birth canal. (Perhaps that is why emergence of the head is like birth!)</p></div>
<div class="indent3"><span class="nm">ii.</span><p>We cannot learn about animals from people, for a person's face is important.</p></div>
<div class="indent2"><span class="nm">3.</span><p><span class="cl">Rejection:</span> Another Mishnah teaches about animals!</p></div>
<div class="indent3"><span class="nm">i.</span><p><span class="cl">(Mishnah):</span> If a fetal sac partially left the womb, one may not eat it. Just like it indicates a fetus in a woman, also in an animal.</p></div>
<div class="indent2"><span class="nm">4.</span><p><span class="cl">Summation of question:</span> If the leg is permitted in the Reisha because the fetus drew it back, we can say that the Seifa discusses returning the head for consistency;</p></div>
<div class="indent3"><span class="nm">i.</span><p>However, if the leg is forbidden whether or not it was returned (and only the rest of the fetus is permitted), there was no need to mention returning (the leg or head) in either clause!</p></div>
<div class="indent1"><span class="nm">(i)</span><p><span class="cl">Answer:</span> Really, the Reisha permits only the rest of the fetus;</p></div>
<div class="indent2"><span class="nm">1.</span><p>It says that the leg returned, for this permits the place where we cut the leg (i.e. the part that was even with the edge of the womb but did not leave.)</p></div>
<div class="indent2"><span class="nm">2.</span><p>Rav Nachman bar Yitzchak likewise explained that a Beraisa (below) permits this part of the leg.</p></div>
<div class="indent1"><span class="nm">(j)</span><p><span class="cl">Question (Beraisa):</span> If an animal was giving birth, and the fetus stuck out a leg and returned it, and then the mother was slaughtered, it is permitted (to eat it);</p></div>
<div class="indent2"><span class="nm">1.</span><p>If it returned the leg after Shechitah, it is forbidden.</p></div>
<div class="indent2"><span class="nm">2.</span><p>If the fetus stuck out a leg and it was cut off before Shechitah, what is outside is Tamei and forbidden. What is inside is Tahor and permitted;</p></div>
<div class="bbbline">68b----------------------------------------68b</p></div>
<div class="indent2"><span class="nm">3.</span><p>R. Meir says, if the leg was cut off after Shechitah, the rest of the fetus is like meat that touched a Nevelah;</p></div>
<div class="indent2"><span class="nm">4.</span><p>Chachamim say, it is like meat that touched a slaughtered Treifah.</p></div>
<div class="indent2"><span class="nm">5.</span><p><span class="cl">Culmination of question - Suggestion:</span> In the Reisha, 'if the fetus stuck out a leg and returned it before Shechitah, it is permitted' refers to the leg.</p></div>
<div class="indent1"><span class="nm">(k)</span><p><span class="cl">Answer #1:</span> No, it refers to (the rest of) the fetus.</p></div>
<div class="indent1"><span class="nm">(l)</span><p><span class="cl">Objection (Seifa):</span> If it returned it after Shechitah, it is forbidden.</p></div>
<div class="indent2"><span class="nm">1.</span><p>Why should (the rest of) the fetus be forbidden?!</p></div>
<div class="indent1"><span class="nm">(m)</span><p><span class="cl">Answer #2:</span> We can answer like Rav Nachman bar Yitzchak answered another Beraisa. It refers to the place where we cut the leg.</p></div>
<div class="indent1"><span class="nm">(n)</span><p><span class="cl">Question (Beraisa):</span> If it returned "Parsah (a leg)", it is permitted. If it returned "Perasos", it is permitted.</p></div>
<div class="indent2"><span class="nm">1.</span><p><span class="cl">Suggestion:</span> This means that if it stuck out limbs, only those that it returned before Shechitah may be eaten.</p></div>
<div class="indent1"><span class="nm">(o)</span><p><span class="cl">Answer #1:</span> No. It means that if it returned, the fetus is permitted.</p></div>
<div class="indent1"><span class="nm">(p)</span><p><span class="cl">Rejection:</span> This cannot be. The rest of the fetus is permitted even if no limbs were returned!</p></div>
<div class="indent1"><span class="nm">(q)</span><p><span class="cl">Answer #2 (Rav Nachman bar Yitzchak):</span> Returning the limb permits the place where we cut the leg.</p></div>
<div class="indent1"><span class="nm">(r)</span><p><span class="cl">Question:</span> The Beraisa expounds two words, Parsah and Perasos!</p></div>
<div class="indent2"><span class="nm">1.</span><p><span class="cl">Suggestion:</span> One permits the place that is cut, and the other permits the limb itself.</p></div>
<div class="indent1"><span class="nm">(s)</span><p><span class="cl">Answer:</span> No. One permits the place that is cut, and the other permits a fetus whose hooves are not split, according to R. Shimon;</p></div>
<div class="indent2"><span class="nm">1.</span><p><span class="cl">(R. Shimon):</span> If an animal with uncloven hooves was born to a cow, it is forbidden.</p></div>
<div class="indent2"><span class="nm">2.</span><p>This is only if the baby was born, but if it was found inside the cow after Shechitah, it is permitted.</p></div>
<div class="subject"><span class="nm">2)</span><p>MEAT THAT LEFT ITS PLACE</p></div>
<div class="indent1"><span class="nm">(a)</span><p><span class="cl">Version #1 (Ula, citing R. Yochanan):</span> The limb itself is permitted (if it was returned).</p></div>
<div class="indent1"><span class="nm">(b)</span><p><span class="cl">Rav Yehudah:</span> Rav and Shmuel forbid!</p></div>
<div class="indent1"><span class="nm">(c)</span><p><span class="cl">Ula:</span> Rav and Shmuel are so special, that we treasure the earth in which they were buried. However, the Halachah follows R. Yochanan.</p></div>
<div class="indent1"><span class="nm">(d)</span><p><span class="cl">(R. Yochanan):</span> "U'Vasar ba'Sadeh Treifah Lo Sochelu" forbids all meat that left its proper place;</p></div>
<div class="indent2"><span class="nm">1.</span><p>The Torah forbids meat of a Chatas that left the Azarah (there is no remedy);</p></div>
<div class="indent2"><span class="nm">2.</span><p><span class="cl">Inference:</span> In all other cases, if the meat is returned to its proper place, it is permitted.</p></div>
<div class="indent1"><span class="nm">(e)</span><p><span class="cl">Question (Beraisa):</span> If Ma'aser Sheni or Bikurim left their proper place (Yerushalayim) and returned, they are permitted;</p></div>
<div class="indent2"><span class="nm">1.</span><p><span class="cl">Suggestion:</span> Also meat that left its proper place and returned is permitted!</p></div>
<div class="indent2"><span class="nm">2.</span><p><span class="cl">Rejection:</span> "U'Vasar ba'Sadeh Treifah Lo Sochelu" teaches that this is not so.</p></div>
<div class="indent2"><span class="nm">3.</span><p><span class="cl">Question:</span> How do we learn this from the verse?</p></div>
<div class="indent2"><span class="nm">4.</span><p><span class="cl">Answer (Rabah):</span> Just like a Treifah never becomes permitted, also meat that left its proper place.</p></div>
<div class="indent2"><span class="nm">5.</span><p>This refutes Ula.</p></div>
<div class="indent1"><span class="nm">(f)</span><p><span class="cl">Question:</span> The Beraisa permits Ma'aser Sheni and Bikurim that left Yerushalayim and returned. What is the source of this?</p></div>
<div class="indent1"><span class="nm">(g)</span><p><span class="cl">Answer:</span> "You may not eat in your gates (i.e. outside Yerushalayim) Ma'aser... ", but you may eat it if it left (Yerushalayim) and returned.</p></div>
<div class="subject"><span class="nm">3)</span><p>BIRTH OF LIMBS</p></div>
<div class="indent1"><span class="nm">(a)</span><p><span class="cl">Version #2:</span> Chachamim of Eretz Yisrael explained the argument between Rav and R. Yochanan as follows.</p></div>
<div class="indent1"><span class="nm">(b)</span><p><span class="cl">(Rav):</span> A limb that leaves the womb is considered as if it was born.</p></div>
<div class="indent1"><span class="nm">(c)</span><p><span class="cl">(R. Yochanan):</span> It is not as if it was born.</p></div>
<div class="indent1"><span class="nm">(d)</span><p><span class="cl">Question:</span> What do Rav and R. Yochanan argue about? (Rif; Rashi - what is the difference between the two versions of the argument?)</p></div>
<div class="indent1"><span class="nm">(e)</span><p><span class="cl">Answer:</span> If the majority of a limb left the womb, they argue about whether this forbids the minority left inside. (In this version, Rav forbids it.) (end of Version #2)</p></div>
<div class="indent1"><span class="nm">(f)</span><p><span class="cl">Question #1:</span> According to R. Yochanan, if one by one, the fetus stuck out limbs and returned them, until the limbs that were once outside comprise the majority of the fetus, what is the law?</p></div>
<div class="indent2"><span class="nm">1.</span><p>Since the majority left, it is born;</p></div>
<div class="indent2"><span class="nm">2.</span><p>Or, once a limb returns, it is as if it never left. (Now the majority is inside, so it is not yet born.)</p></div>
<div class="indent1"><span class="nm">(g)</span><p><span class="cl">Question #2:</span> If we say that once a limb returns, it is as if it never left, if it stuck out limbs one by one and they were cut off, until the majority left, what is the law?</p></div>
<div class="indent2"><span class="nm">1.</span><p>Since the majority left, it is born;</p></div>
<div class="indent2"><span class="nm">2.</span><p>Or, perhaps a majority must be outside at one time.</p></div>
