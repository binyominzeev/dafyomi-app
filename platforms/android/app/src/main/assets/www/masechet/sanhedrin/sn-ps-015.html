<p class="bas indent1"><span class="nm">(a)</span><span class="cl">Answer #1 (Rav Gidal):</span> Someone said 'it is (encumbent) on me to give (to Hekdesh) the Erech of this Keli.'</p>
<p class="bas indent2"><span class="nm">1.</span><span class="cl">(Rav Gidal):</span> If someone said 'it is upon me to give the Erech of this Keli', he must give its value.</p>
<p class="bas indent2"><span class="nm">2.</span><span class="cl">Question:</span> What is the reason?</p>
<p class="bas indent2"><span class="nm">3.</span><span class="cl">Answer:</span> A person knows that Erchin does not apply to Kelim. Surely he meant to give its value.</p>
<p class="bas indent2"><span class="nm">4.</span><span class="cl">Question:</span> Why does the Mishnah say 'Erchin ha'Metaltelim'? It should say 'Erchin <i>of</i> Metaltelim'!</p>
<p class="bas indent2"><span class="nm">5.</span><span class="cl">Answer:</span> Indeed, the proper text is Erchin of Metaltelim.</p>
<p class="bas indent1"><span class="nm">(b)</span><span class="cl">Answer #2 (Rav Chisda):</span> The Mishnah discusses one who designates a Keli for payment of Erchin.</p>
<p class="bas indent2"><span class="nm">1.</span><span class="cl">Question:</span> Why does the Mishnah say 'Erchin ha'Metaltelim'? It should say 'Metaltelim of Erchin'!</p>
<p class="bas indent2"><span class="nm">2.</span><span class="cl">Answer:</span> Indeed, the proper text is Metaltelim of Erchin.</p>
<p class="bas indent1"><span class="nm">(c)</span><span class="cl">Answer #3 (R. Avahu):</span> The case is, he said 'it is upon me to give my Erech';</p>
<p class="bas indent2"><span class="nm">1.</span>If the Kohen comes to collect it from Metaltelim, three judges are required. If he comes to collect it from land, 10 are required.</p>
<p class="bas indent1"><span class="nm">(d)</span><span class="cl">Question (Rav Acha mi'Difti):</span> We understand why three judges are required to <i>take</i> from Hekdesh. Why are three needed to <i>give</i> to Hekdesh?</p>
<p class="bas indent1"><span class="nm">(e)</span><span class="cl">Answer (Ravina):</span> Reasoning teaches that the same applies to taking and giving;</p>
<p class="bas indent2"><span class="nm">1.</span>Taking requires three because we are concerned for an error. The same applies to giving!</p>
<p class="bas subject"><span class="nm">2)</span>REDEMPTION OF LAND AND PEOPLE</p>
<p class="bas indent1"><span class="nm">(a)</span><span class="cl">(Mishnah - R. Yehudah):</span> (One of them must be a Kohen.)</p>
<p class="bas indent1"><span class="nm">(b)</span><span class="cl">Question (Rav Papa):</span> According to R. Yehudah, we understand why it says 'Kohen';</p>
<p class="bas indent2"><span class="nm">1.</span>According to Chachamim, why does it say 'Kohen'?</p>
<p class="bas indent1"><span class="nm">(c)</span>This is left difficult.</p>
<p class="bas indent1"><span class="nm">(d)</span><span class="cl">(Mishnah):</span> Redemption of land needs nine people and a Kohen.</p>
<p class="bas indent1"><span class="nm">(e)</span><span class="cl">Question:</span> What is the source of this?</p>
<p class="bas indent1"><span class="nm">(f)</span><span class="cl">Answer (Shmuel):</span> There are 10 mentions of Kohanim in the Parshiyos (of Erchin and redemption of Hekdesh);</p>
<p class="bas indent2"><span class="nm">1.</span>The first teaches that a Kohen is required. Every other one is an exclusion following an exclusion;</p>
<p class="bas indent2"><span class="nm">2.</span>An exclusion following an exclusion always comes to include (i.e. the other nine occurrences of 'Kohen' teach that Yisraelim are acceptable).</p>
<p class="bas indent1"><span class="nm">(g)</span><span class="cl">Question (Rav Huna brei d'Rav Noson):</span> We should require five Kohanim and five (that can even be) Yisraelim! (Indeed, the second 'Kohen' includes even a Yisrael. However, the third is therefore an exclusion after an <i>inclusion</i>, which is an exclusion, i.e. it mandates a Kohen! Likewise, the fifth, seventh and ninth are exclusions.)</p>
<p class="bas indent1"><span class="nm">(h)</span>This is left difficult.</p>
<p class="bas indent1"><span class="nm">(i)</span><span class="cl">(Mishnah):</span> Man has the same law (as land).</p>
<p class="bas indent1"><span class="nm">(j)</span><span class="cl">Question:</span> Is man Kodesh, that he must be redeemed?!</p>
<p class="bas indent1"><span class="nm">(k)</span><span class="cl">Answer (R. Avahu):</span> The case is, he said 'it is upon me to give my value (to Hekdesh).'</p>
<p class="bas indent2"><span class="nm">1.</span><span class="cl">(Beraisa):</span> If one said 'it is upon me to give my value', we estimate what one would pay to buy him to be a Kena'ani slave;</p>
<p class="bas indent2"><span class="nm">2.</span>Slaves are equated to land (therefore, their laws of redemption are the same).</p>
<p class="bas indent1"><span class="nm">(l)</span><span class="cl">Question (R. Avin):</span> How many are required to estimate the value of hair that should be cut?</p>
<p class="bas indent2"><span class="nm">1.</span>If we consider it as if it was already cut, (it is Metaltelim,) three are required;</p>
<p class="bas indent2"><span class="nm">2.</span>If we consider it to be attached, 10 are required (like for people).</p>
<p class="bas indent1"><span class="nm">(m)</span><span class="cl">Answer (Beraisa):</span> If one makes his slave Hekdesh, Me'ilah does not apply;</p>
<p class="bas indent2"><span class="nm">1.</span>R. Shimon ben Gamliel says, Me'ilah applies to his hair.</p>
<p class="bas indent2"><span class="nm">2.</span>They argue about hair that should be cut. (R. Shimon ben Gamliel considers it as if it was already cut. The first Tana does not.)</p>
<p class="bas indent1"><span class="nm">(n)</span><span class="cl">Suggestion:</span> They argue as the following Tana'im argue.</p>
<p class="bas indent2"><span class="nm">1.</span><span class="cl">(Mishnah - R. Meir):</span> Some things are like land, but they are not considered like land. If Reuven says 'I entrusted you with 10 laden vines', and Shimon admits to five, he must swear (like one who partially admits to a claim of Metaltelim);</p>
<p class="bas indent2"><span class="nm">2.</span>Chachamim (exempt, for they) say that anything attached is like land.</p>
<p class="bas indent2"><span class="nm">3.</span><span class="cl">(R. Yosi bar Chanina):</span> They argue about grapes that are ready to be harvested. R. Meir considers them as if they were already harvested, and Chachamim do not.</p>
<p class="bas indent1"><span class="nm">(o)</span><span class="cl">Rejection:</span> Chachamim (of the Beraisa) can hold like R. Meir. He considers grapes as if they were harvested, for they get worse if left attached too long (so surely they will be harvested soon);</p>
<p class="bas indent2"><span class="nm">1.</span>Hair increases in value the longer it is attached. R. Meir can consider it to be attached!</p>
<p class="bas subject"><span class="nm">3)</span>KILLING AN ANIMAL</p>
<p class="bas indent1"><span class="nm">(a)</span><span class="cl">(Mishnah):</span> Capital cases (require 23 judges. If an animal was Rove'a (put its penis into) a person, 23 judges are required to kill it.)</p>
<p class="bas indent1"><span class="nm">(b)</span>We do not distinguish whether it was Rove'a a man or woman.</p>
<p class="bas indent1"><span class="nm">(c)</span><span class="cl">Question:</span> Granted, 23 judges are required to kill an animal that was Rove'a a woman - "v'Horagta Es ha'Ishah v'Es ha'Behemah" (equates killing the animal to killing her);</p>
<p class="bas indent2"><span class="nm">1.</span>Why are 23 required to kill an animal that was Rove'a a man?</p>
<p class="bas indent1"><span class="nm">(d)</span><span class="cl">Answer:</span> We do not need "Kol Shochev Im Behemah Mos Yumas" to teach about a man who was Rove'a an animal ("v'Ish Asher Yiten Shechavto bi'Vhemah Mos Yumas v'Es ha'Behemah Taharogu" equates killing him to killing it), so we use it to teach about an animal that was Rove'a a man;</p>
<p class="bas indent2"><span class="nm">1.</span>The Torah taught about an animal that was Rove'a with words ("Shochev Im Behemah") that  connote that the man was Rove'a, to teach that the law is the same when he is Rove'a or it is Rove'a, i.e. 23 judges are required to kill him and to kill it.</p>
<p class="bas indent1"><span class="nm">(e)</span><span class="cl">(Mishnah):</span> An animal that is stoned (for killing a Yisrael) requires 23 judges - "ha'Shor Yisakel v'Gam Be'alav Yumas." The animal is killed like its owner (a person).</p>
<p class="bas indent1"><span class="nm">(f)</span><span class="cl">Question (Abaye):</span> What is the source that "v'Gam Be'alav Yumas" teaches that the animal is killed like a person? Perhaps it teaches that we kill the owner!</p>
<p class="bas bbbline">15b----------------------------------------15b</p>
<p class="bas indent1"><span class="nm">(g)</span><span class="cl">Answer #1 (Rava):</span> If the owner should be killed, it should have said only "(ha'Shor Yisakel) v'Gam Be'alav";</p>
<p class="bas indent2"><span class="nm">1.</span>Rather, "Yumas" equates the animal's judgment to that of a person.</p>
<p class="bas indent2"><span class="nm">2.</span><span class="cl">Question:</span> Perhaps the Torah did not say only 'ha'Shor Yisakel v'Gam Be'alav', for this would imply that the owner is stoned. "Yumas" teaches that he is killed differently (by choking)!</p>
<p class="bas indent2"><span class="nm">3.</span><span class="cl">Answer:</span> We would never have thought that the owner is stoned. A man who kills is killed by the sword. He cannot be stoned (a harsher Misah) for not stopping his animal from killing!</p>
<p class="bas indent2"><span class="nm">4.</span><span class="cl">Question:</span> Perhaps 'ha'Shor Yisakel v'Gam Be'alav' would imply that the owner is killed by the sword, and "Yumas" teaches that he is killed by choking!</p>
<p class="bas indent3"><span class="nm">i.</span>This is not difficult for the opinion that choking is harsher than the sword (he cannot receive a harsher death for his ox's goring than if he himself had murdered);</p>
<p class="bas indent3"><span class="nm">ii.</span>According to the opinion that the sword is harsher than choking, how can we answer?</p>
<p class="bas indent2"><span class="nm">5.</span><span class="cl">Answer:</span> "Im Kofer Yushas Alav" teaches that he pays ransom;</p>
<p class="bas indent3"><span class="nm">i.</span>If he were Chayav Misah (liable to be killed), he could not pay ransom - "v'Lo Tikchu Kofer l'Nefesh Rotze'ach."</p>
<p class="bas indent2"><span class="nm">6.</span><span class="cl">Rejection:</span> The verse teaches that a <i>murderer</i> cannot redeem himself, but perhaps ransom can save one who is Chayav Misah because his ox killed!</p>
<p class="bas indent1"><span class="nm">(h)</span><span class="cl">Answer #2 (Chizkiyah):</span> "Mos Yumas ha'Makeh Rotze'ach Hu" - a man is killed if he killed, but not if his ox killed.</p>
<p class="bas indent1"><span class="nm">(i)</span><span class="cl">Question:</span> How many judges would have been required to kill an animal that alighted on Har Sinai (at the time the Torah was given)?</p>
<p class="bas indent2"><span class="nm">1.</span>Do we learn this law, which only applied once, from the law that applies to all generations (that 23 judges are required to kill an animal)?</p>
<p class="bas indent1"><span class="nm">(j)</span><span class="cl">Answer:</span> We learn from Rami bar Yechezkeil.</p>
<p class="bas indent2"><span class="nm">1.</span><span class="cl">(Rami bar Yechezkeil):</span> "Im Behemah Im Ish Lo Yichyeh" - just like 23 judges would be required to kill a person who alighted on Har Sinai, also to kill an animal.</p>
<p class="bas subject"><span class="nm">4)</span>KILLING WILD ANIMALS</p>
<p class="bas indent1"><span class="nm">(a)</span><span class="cl">(Mishnah):</span> Twenty-three judges are needed to kill a wolf, lion...</p>
<p class="bas indent1"><span class="nm">(b)</span><span class="cl">(Reish Lakish):</span> This is only if they killed. If not, we do not kill them.</p>
<p class="bas indent1"><span class="nm">(c)</span><span class="cl">Inference:</span> He holds that these animals can be domesticated, and a person can own them.</p>
<p class="bas indent1"><span class="nm">(d)</span><span class="cl">(R. Yochanan):</span> We kill them even if they did not kill.</p>
<p class="bas indent1"><span class="nm">(e)</span><span class="cl">Inference:</span> He holds that they cannot be domesticated, and one cannot own them.</p>
<p class="bas indent1"><span class="nm">(f)</span><span class="cl">(Mishnah - R. Eliezer):</span> If anyone kills one of these (without Beis Din), he merited.</p>
<p class="bas indent1"><span class="nm">(g)</span><span class="cl">Question:</span> Granted, according to R. Yochanan, he merits to keep the hide.</p>
<p class="bas indent2"><span class="nm">1.</span>According to Reish Lakish, what does he merit? The animal will be stoned. One may not benefit from it!</p>
<p class="bas indent1"><span class="nm">(h)</span><span class="cl">Answer:</span> He will be rewarded from Hash-m (for doing a proper deed).</p>
<p class="bas indent1"><span class="nm">(i)</span><span class="cl">Support (for Reish Lakish - Beraisa):</span> The same applies to an ox, Behemah or Chayah that killed. We need 23 judges to kill it;</p>
<p class="bas indent1"><span class="nm">(j)</span>R. Eliezer says, 23 judges are needed to kill an ox that killed. If any other Behemah or Chayah killed, whoever kills it will be rewarded from Hash-m.</p>
<p class="bas indent1"><span class="nm">(k)</span><span class="cl">(Mishnah):</span> R. Akiva says, 23 judges are needed.</p>
<p class="bas indent1"><span class="nm">(l)</span><span class="cl">Question:</span> This is like the first Tana!</p>
<p class="bas indent1"><span class="nm">(m)</span><span class="cl">Answer:</span> They argue about killing a snake. (The first Tana requires 23 to kill it. R. Akiva does not.)</p>
<p class="bas subject"><span class="nm">5)</span>JUDGING A SHEVET</p>
<p class="bas indent1"><span class="nm">(a)</span>Seventy-one judges are needed to judge a Shevet.</p>
<p class="bas indent1"><span class="nm">(b)</span><span class="cl">Question:</span> What did it transgress?</p>

<p class="bas indent1"><span class="nm">(c)</span><span class="cl">Answer #1:</span> It was enticed to serve idolatry.</p>
<p class="bas indent2"><span class="nm">1.</span><span class="cl">Inference:</span> If a Shevet seved idolatry, it is judged like a multitude (i.e. an Ir ha'Nidachas, a city destroyed because its majority served idolatry); . The transgressors are killed by the sword instead of being stoned.)</p>
