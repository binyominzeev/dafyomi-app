<div class="indent2"><span class="nm">1.</span><p>This is the Shi'ur (of a shard) if the Kli initially held until a Log (before it broke).</p></div>

<div class="indent2"><span class="nm">1.</span><p>The Tana simply said 'forbidden' for contrast to the Reisha, which permits a cut part of the fetus.</p></div>

<div class="indent1"><span class="nm">(n)</span><p><span class="cl">(Rav Ashi):</span> We do not learn from one Tereifah to another. If one cuts an animal in one place, it is Tereifah, but if he cuts elsewhere, it is Kosher!</p></div>

<div class="indent2"><span class="nm">1.</span><p><span class="cl">(Beraisa - R. Shimon ben Elazar):</span> R. Meir and Chachamim did not argue. They agree that Gludah is Tereifah. If skin the size of a Sela remains, it is Kosher.</p></div>
