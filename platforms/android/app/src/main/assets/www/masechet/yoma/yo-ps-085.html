<div class="subject"><span class="nm">1)</span><p>SHMUEL ON ROV IN PIKUACH NEFESH (cont'd)</p></div>
<div class="indent1"><span class="nm">(a)</span><p><span class="cl">Question:</span> But Shmuel taught (on the Mishnah determining the status of an abandoned child) that we only permit saving the buried person when there is a Jewish majority!?</p></div>
<div class="indent1"><span class="nm">(b)</span><p><span class="cl">Answer:</span> Shmuel was qualifying the Reisha of that Mishnah (which presumes that the child is a Gentile when the majority of residents are non-Jews) by saying that regarding Pikuach Nefesh, we do not apply this majority rule and we <i>do</i> save the person (consistent with his earlier teaching).</p></div>
<div class="subject"><span class="nm">2)</span><p>THE MISHNAH REGARDING AN ABANDONED CHILD</p></div>
<div class="indent1"><span class="nm">(a)</span><p><span class="cl">Question:</span> What application can be derived from assuming the child to be a non-Jew if the majority are non-Jews?</p></div>
<div class="indent1"><span class="nm">(b)</span><p><span class="cl">Answer:</span> To permit feeding him non-kosher food.</p></div>
<div class="indent1"><span class="nm">(c)</span><p><span class="cl">Question:</span> And of what consequence is the teaching that he is considered a Jew when surrounded by a Jewish majority (since we may not feed him non-kosher food even when it is 50-50)?</p></div>
<div class="indent1"><span class="nm">(d)</span><p><span class="cl">Answer:</span> We must return his lost articles (which we would not do if it was 50-50).</p></div>
<div class="indent1"><span class="nm">(e)</span><p><span class="cl">Question:</span> What is the consequence of teaching that in a 50- 50 case we will see him as a Jew?</p></div>
<div class="indent1"><span class="nm">(f)</span><p><span class="cl">Answer:</span> For the purposes of damages.</p></div>
<div class="indent2"><span class="nm">1.</span><p><span class="cl">Question:</span> If a Jew's ox gored his, he should have to bring proof of his Jewishness in order to collect (the burden of proof is always on the claimant)!?</p></div>
<div class="indent2"><span class="nm">2.</span><p><span class="cl">Answer:</span> It is speaking in a case when <i>his</i> ox (a Tam) gores that of a Jew, and the Jew is claiming <i>full</i> damages (which a gentile would be obligated to pay) and the Jew would have to prove that the child is a non-Jew to collect full damages.</p></div>
<div class="subject"><span class="nm">3)</span><p>THE DOUBTS ARISING IN THE CASE OF THE TRAPPED PERSON</p></div>
<div class="indent1"><span class="nm">(a)</span><p><span class="cl">Question:</span> Why does the Mishnah list all of the possible doubts?</p></div>
<div class="indent1"><span class="nm">(b)</span><p><span class="cl">Answer:</span> The Mishnah is built in steps of not only...</p></div>
<div class="indent2"><span class="nm">1.</span><p>Not only if we are in doubt if a person is there, but even if there is a doubt if he is alive;</p></div>
<div class="indent2"><span class="nm">2.</span><p>And not only if we are in doubt if he is alive, but even if we are in doubt if he is a Jew.</p></div>
<div class="subject"><span class="nm">4)</span><p>SAVING THE BURIED MAN</p></div>
<div class="indent1"><span class="nm">(a)</span><p><span class="cl">Question:</span> It is <i>obvious</i> that if they found the buried man alive, they continue to dig!?</p></div>
<div class="indent1"><span class="nm">(b)</span><p><span class="cl">Answer:</span> We dig even if it would only be possible to keep him alive for a short period of time (however short).</p></div>
<div class="indent1"><span class="nm">(c)</span><p><span class="cl">Question:</span> It is <i>obvious</i> that if he is dead we leave him!?</p></div>
<div class="indent1"><span class="nm">(d)</span><p><span class="cl">Answer:</span> We need to be taught this Din according to R. Yehudah b. Lakish.</p></div>
<div class="indent2"><span class="nm">1.</span><p>R. Yehudah b. Lakish permits carrying a corpse [which is Muktzeh] from a fire, into a courtyard with an Eruv, lest one [out of respect for the dead person] come to extinguish the fire).</p></div>
<div class="indent2"><span class="nm">2.</span><p>He did not permit digging up the corpse (since there no Isur d'Oraysa which he might come to transgress).</p></div>
<div class="indent1"><span class="nm">(e)</span><p><span class="cl">Question:</span> How far do we dig to establish if he is alive?</p></div>
<div class="indent1"><span class="nm">(f)</span><p><span class="cl">Answer:</span> Until his nose and check his breathing.</p></div>
<div class="indent1"><span class="nm">(g)</span><p><span class="cl">Answer:</span> Until his heart, to check his pulse.  If Many people were buried in an accident, and those above are found to be dead we are obligated to continue digging to check the ones below independently.</p></div>
<div class="indent2"><span class="nm">1.</span><p>The incident bears this out.]</p></div>
<div class="indent1"><span class="nm">(h)</span><p><span class="cl">Question:</span> Is this Machlokes hinged on the Machlokes regarding the creation of a person?</p></div>
<div class="indent2"><span class="nm">1.</span><p>The Tana Kama brings proofs that a baby is formed from the head.</p></div>
<div class="indent2"><span class="nm">2.</span><p>Aba Shaul says from the navel (since Hash-m created everything from the middle).</p></div>
<div class="indent1"><span class="nm">(i)</span><p><span class="cl">Answer:</span> Even Aba Shaul could agree here to check his respiration since they are only discussing the creation of the person, not saving the life of the person (which, the Pasuk indicates, lies in his breathing).</p></div>
<div class="indent1"><span class="nm">(j)</span><p><span class="cl">(R. Papa):</span> The above Machlokes is speaking where we are digging from his feet.</p></div>
<div class="indent2"><span class="nm">1.</span><p>Tana Kama holds to dig all the way to his nose and not to rely on the absence of pulse.</p></div>
<div class="indent2"><span class="nm">2.</span><p>Yesh Omerim hold that the absence of pulse is sufficient indication of the absence of respiration.</p></div>
<div class="indent1"><span class="nm">(k)</span><p>A group of Tana'im were asked for the source of the Halachah that saving human life (even be'Safek) takes precedence over Shabbos.</p></div>
<div class="indent2"><span class="nm">1.</span><p>R. Yishmael derived it from the Pasuk "Im ba'Machteres Yimatzei ha'Ganav ... " (If one is permitted to kill [with all its implications] in place of <i>Safek</i> Piku'ach Nefesh, then one should certainly be permitted to break the Shabbos for that).</p></div>
<div class="indent2"><span class="nm">2.</span><p>R. Akiva inferred it from the Pasuk "me'Im Mizbechi Tikachenu Lamus", (If we will even interrupt the Avodah (which over-rides Shabbos) to call a witness (whose testimony may not be of any value), to save someone's life then we should certainly break the Shabbos in order to do so.</p></div>
<div class="bbbline">85b----------------------------------------85b</p></div>
<div class="indent2"><span class="nm">3.</span><p>R. Elazar responded from the Mitzvah of Milah - because if one may break Shabbos to rectify <i>one</i> limb then one may certainly do so to rectify the <i>entire body</i>.</p></div>
<div class="indent2"><span class="nm">4.</span><p>R. Yosi b. R. Yehudah learns it from the excluding word "Ach" (to teach us that there are cases where one is permitted to break the Shabbos).</p></div>
<div class="indent2"><span class="nm">5.</span><p>R. Yonasan b. Yosef learns it from "Kodesh Hi Lachem" (Shabbos is handed over to <i>us</i> [to observe], and not <i>us</i> to <i>it</i> [to die]).</p></div>
<div class="indent2"><span class="nm">6.</span><p>R. Shimon b. Menasyah derives it from "ve'Shameru B'nei Yisrael Es ha'Shabbos" (one should break one Shabbos to enable the person who will otherwise die, to keep many Shabbasos).</p></div>
<div class="indent2"><span class="nm">7.</span><p>Shmuel later asserted that it is best learned from the Pasuk "ve'Chai Bahem ("Live with the Mitzvos", 'and do not die with them').</p></div>
<div class="indent1"><span class="nm">(l)</span><p>Rava found a weakness with each of the sources (each could be understood to permit only Piku'ach Nefesh <i>Vadai</i> not <i>Safek</i> Pikuach Nefesh which we are seeking) other than that of Shmuel.</p></div>
<div class="indent2"><span class="nm">1.</span><p>R. Yishmael's source may be understood (as Rava understands it) to refer to a certainty that the thief will kill the homeowner (given the principle that a person does not stand idly by when his money is being taken away).</p></div>
<div class="indent2"><span class="nm">2.</span><p>R. Akiva's source may be understood (as Abaye understands it) that two Talmidei-Chachamim will check that his testimony is valuable, in which case, it is no longer a case of Safek Piku'ach Nefesh, but Vadai.</p></div>
<div class="indent2"><span class="nm">3.</span><p>Similarly with the other sources mentioned.</p></div>
<div class="indent2"><span class="nm">4.</span><p>Shmuel's source is the only one which covers <i>Safek</i> Piku'ach Nefesh, because the Pasuk implies that the Mitzvos must be a source of life at all costs, whether one keeps them, or not.</p></div>
<div class="indent1"><span class="nm">(m)</span><p>This led Ravina to praise Shmuel's teaching (one sharp peppercorn is better than a basket-full of pumpkins).</p></div>
<div class="subject"><span class="nm">5)</span><p>MISHNAH: THE ATONEMENT OF KORBANOS AND YOM KIPUR</p></div>
<div class="indent1"><span class="nm">(a)</span><p>Korbanos Chatas and Asham (Vadai), and Misah and Yom Kipur atone, together with Teshuvah.</p></div>
<div class="indent1"><span class="nm">(b)</span><p>Teshuvah alone atones for Mitzvos Asei and Lo Sa'aseh.</p></div>
<div class="indent1"><span class="nm">(c)</span><p>Aveiros which incur Misah require Yom Kipur (to suspend the afflictions) and Yom Kipur to atone, with Teshuvah.</p></div>
<div class="indent1"><span class="nm">(d)</span><p>One who plans to do an Aveirah and Teshuvah for it, is hindered from doing Teshuvah.</p></div>
<div class="indent1"><span class="nm">(e)</span><p>One who does an Aveirah relying on the atonement of Yom Kipur does not benefit from that atonement.</p></div>
<div class="indent1"><span class="nm">(f)</span><p>Yom Kipur does not atone for sins between man and man.</p></div>
<div class="indent2"><span class="nm">1.</span><p>These require reconciliation between the parties.</p></div>
<div class="indent2"><span class="nm">2.</span><p>R. Elazar b. Azaryah learns this from the Pasuk Lifnei Hash-m Tit'haru.</p></div>
<div class="indent1"><span class="nm">(g)</span><p>R. Akiva learns from the Pasuk that Hash-m purifies us from our sins just as a Mikvah purifies those who are impure.</p></div>
<div class="subject"><span class="nm">6)</span><p>ASHAM TALUI</p></div>
<div class="indent1"><span class="nm">(a)</span><p><span class="cl">Question:</span> Asham Taluy should be mentioned together with Chatas and Asham Vadai - since the word "Kaparah" appears there, too!?</p></div>
<div class="indent1"><span class="nm">(b)</span><p><span class="cl">Answer:</span> An Asham Taluy, unlike an Asham Vaday, does not atone completely (it only holds off the punishment until he ascertains that he sinned and can bring his Chatas).</p></div>
<div class="indent1"><span class="nm">(c)</span><p><span class="cl">Alternate Answer:</span> The Asham Taluy is not grouped with the others since Yom Kipur is a backup Kaparah for it.</p></div>
<div class="subject"><span class="nm">7)</span><p>DEATH AND YOM KIPUR WITH OR WITHOUT TESHUVAH</p></div>
<div class="indent1"><span class="nm">(a)</span><p><span class="cl">Question:</span> If we infer that without Teshuvah Yom Kipur and Misah do not atone, then this would not follow the opinion of Rebbi (according to whom Yom Kipur atones even without Teshuvah, with the exception of one who denies Hash-m (Porek Ol), interprets the Torah however it suits him or negates the B'ris Milah).</p></div>
<div class="indent1"><span class="nm">(b)</span><p><span class="cl">Answer:</span> Rebbi might agree with our Mishnah, which only says that Teshuvah alone needs Yom Kipur; it does not say that Yom Kipur needs Teshuvah.</p></div>
<div class="subject"><span class="nm">8)</span><p>R. YEHUDAH ON ASEI AND LO SA'ASEI</p></div>
<div class="indent1"><span class="nm">(a)</span><p><span class="cl">Question:</span> If Teshuvah atones for Mitzvos Lo Sa'aseh, is it not obvious that it will atone for Mitzvos Asei as well!?</p></div>
<div class="indent1"><span class="nm">(b)</span><p><span class="cl">Answer:</span> R. Yehudah therefore amends Lo Sa'aseh to Lav ha'Nitak la'Asei (which needs to be also taught as it does not incur Malkos, and is not more stringent than an Asei).</p></div>
<div class="indent1"><span class="nm">(c)</span><p><span class="cl">Question:</span> Does Teshuvah then <i>not</i> atone for a Lo Sa'aseh!?</p></div>
<div class="indent2"><span class="nm">1.</span><p>The Beraisa teaches that Teshuvah <i>does</i> atone for Lo Sa'aseh.</p></div>
<div class="indent2"><span class="nm">2.</span><p>The only exception listed in Beraisa is "Lo Sisa" (swearing falsely).</p></div>
<div class="indent1"><span class="nm">(d)</span><p><span class="cl">Answer:</span> The Tana means by "Lo Sisa" to include with it all comparable Lavin (which are not Nitak la'Asei).</p></div>
