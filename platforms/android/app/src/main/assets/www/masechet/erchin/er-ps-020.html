<div class="indent1"><span class="nm">(a)</span><p><span class="cl">Question #3:</span> (If you will say that we are concerned lest his value increased,) if he said "Dami Alai," and before we estimated him, he said this again, what is the law?</p></div>
<div class="indent2"><span class="nm">1.</span><p>Surely, one estimate suffices;</p></div>
<div class="indent2"><span class="nm">2.</span><p>Or, perhaps since he vowed at two distinct times, he must be evaluated for each by itself!</p></div>
<div class="indent1"><span class="nm">(b)</span><p><span class="cl">Question #4:</span> If you will say that he must be evaluated for each by itself, what if he said "Twice my Damim is Alai at once"?</p></div>
<div class="indent2"><span class="nm">1.</span><p>Since both vows takes effect at once, one estimate suffices;</p></div>
<div class="indent2"><span class="nm">2.</span><p>Or, since he said "twice," it is like vows at distinct times!</p></div>
<div class="indent1"><span class="nm">(c)</span><p><span class="cl">Question #5:</span> If you will say that it is like vows at distinct times (Tosfos - really, this does not depend on the previous questions), if 10 people estimated him for no reason, and then he said "Dami Alai", what is the law?</p></div>
<div class="indent2"><span class="nm">1.</span><p>Since he was just estimated, we may rely on this;</p></div>
<div class="indent2"><span class="nm">2.</span><p>Or, perhaps they must intend to estimate for the sake of Erchin.</p></div>
<div class="indent1"><span class="nm">(d)</span><p><span class="cl">Answer (to Question 5 - Mishnah):</span> If one said "Dami Alai" and died, his heirs are exempt.</p></div>
<div class="indent2"><span class="nm">1.</span><p>If we may rely on a previous estimate, surely we know that (any normal person) was worth at least four Zuz!</p></div>
<div class="indent1"><span class="nm">(e)</span><p><span class="cl">Version #1 (Rashi) Rejection:</span> The estimate of his value must be in his lifetime (Rambam - to fulfill Ha'amadah and Ha'arachah; Ra'avad - to make it like an act of Beis Din, according to the opinion that a Milveh Al Peh cannot be collected from heirs).</p></div>
<div class="indent1"><span class="nm">(f)</span><p><span class="cl">Version #2 (R. Gershom) Rejection:</span> The estimate of his value must be precise.</p></div>
<div class="subject"><span class="nm">2)</span><p>STRINGENCIES OF DAMIM AND ERCHIN</p></div>
<div class="indent1"><span class="nm">(a)</span><p><span class="cl">(Mishnah):</span> A stringency of Erchin over Nedarim is that if one said "Erki Alai" and died, his heirs are liable. If he said "Dami Alai" and died, his heirs are exempt, for a Mes has no value.</p></div>
<div class="indent1"><span class="nm">(b)</span><p>If one said "the Erech of my arm or leg is Alai," his words do not take effect. If he said "the Erech of my head or liver is Alai," he gives his full Erech.</p></div>
<div class="indent2"><span class="nm">1.</span><p>The general rule is, one pays full Erech for Erech of a vital organ.</p></div>
<div class="indent1"><span class="nm">(c)</span><p>If one said "half my Erech is Alai," he pays half his Erech. If he said "the Erech of half of me is Alai," he pays his full Erech;</p></div>
<div class="indent1"><span class="nm">(d)</span><p>If one said "half my Damim is Alai," he pays half his value. If he said "the Damim of half of me is Alai," he pays his full value;</p></div>
<div class="indent2"><span class="nm">1.</span><p>The general rule is, one who pledges the Damim of something essential to life gives his full Damim.</p></div>
<div class="indent1"><span class="nm">(e)</span><p>If Reuven said "the Erech of Ploni is Alai," and Reuven and Ploni died, Reuven's heirs pay the Erech;</p></div>
<div class="indent1"><span class="nm">(f)</span><p>If he said "Demai Ploni Alai," and Reuven died, his heirs pay it;</p></div>
<div class="indent2"><span class="nm">1.</span><p>If (also) Ploni died, Reuven's heirs are exempt, for a Mes has no value.</p></div>
<div class="indent1"><span class="nm">(g)</span><p><span class="cl">(Gemara - Beraisa):</span> A stringency of Nedarim (i.e. Damim) over Erchin is that Nedarim apply to Behemos, Chayos and birds, and a poor person must pay the full amount. These do not apply to Erchin;</p></div>
<div class="indent1"><span class="nm">(h)</span><p>A stringency of Erchin over Nedarim is that if one said "Erki Alai" and died, his heirs are liable. If he said "Dami Alai" and died, his heirs are exempt, for a Mes has no value.</p></div>
<div class="indent1"><span class="nm">(i)</span><p><span class="cl">Inference:</span> A Milveh Al Peh (a loan without a document) can be collected from heirs.</p></div>
<div class="indent1"><span class="nm">(j)</span><p><span class="cl">Rejection:</span> No. Erchin is unlike a regular Milveh Al Peh, for it is explicit in the Torah.</p></div>
<div class="indent1"><span class="nm">(k)</span><p><span class="cl">Inference:</span> An obligation explicitly written in the Torah is considered like a Milveh bi'Shtar (a loan with a document).</p></div>
<div class="indent1"><span class="nm">(l)</span><p><span class="cl">Rejection:</span> No. The case is, Beis Din already obligated him to pay. (All agree that an act of Beis Din is like a Milveh bi'Shtar.)</p></div>
<div class="indent1"><span class="nm">(m)</span><p><span class="cl">Question:</span> If so, also regarding Damim, Beis Din already obligated him to pay. Why are the heirs exempt?</p></div>
<div class="indent1"><span class="nm">(n)</span><p><span class="cl">Answer:</span> There is no obligation to pay Damim until estimation is done. Erchin does not require estimation.</p></div>
<div class="subject"><span class="nm">3)</span><p>PARTIAL ERCHIN</p></div>
<div class="indent1"><span class="nm">(a)</span><p><span class="cl">(Mishnah):</span> If one said "the Erech of my arm or leg is Alai"...</p></div>
<div class="indent1"><span class="nm">(b)</span><p><span class="cl">(Rav Gidal citing Rav):</span> He gives the value of the limb.</p></div>
<div class="indent1"><span class="nm">(c)</span><p><span class="cl">Question:</span> The Mishnah says that his words do not take effect!</p></div>
<div class="indent1"><span class="nm">(d)</span><p><span class="cl">Answer:</span> His words do not take effect according to Chachamim, but they take effect according to R. Meir.</p></div>
<div class="indent1"><span class="nm">(e)</span><p><span class="cl">Question:</span> Rav already taught this in another way!</p></div>
<div class="indent2"><span class="nm">1.</span><p><span class="cl">(Rav Gidal citing Rav):</span> If one said "the Erech of this Kli is Alai," he must give its value (according to R. Meir).</p></div>
<div class="indent1"><span class="nm">(f)</span><p><span class="cl">Answer:</span> One might have thought only here he is obligated, for all know that a Kli has no Erech, so surely, he intended to give its value;</p></div>
<div class="indent2"><span class="nm">1.</span><p>However, perhaps one who says "Erech Yadi Alai" errs. He/ thinks that this obligates paying (his full) Erech, just like "Erech Roshi Alai," and he did not intend for Damim. Rav teaches that this is not so.</p></div>
<div class="indent1"><span class="nm">(g)</span><p><span class="cl">(Mishnah):</span> If he said "the Erech of my head or liver is Alai," he gives his full Erech.</p></div>
<div class="indent1"><span class="nm">(h)</span><p><span class="cl">Question:</span> What is the reason?</p></div>
<div class="indent1"><span class="nm">(i)</span><p><span class="cl">Answer:</span> It says "Nefashos" (anything vital to life).</p></div>
<div class="indent1"><span class="nm">(j)</span><p><span class="cl">(Mishnah):</span> <i>The general rule</i> is, one who pledges the Erech of something essential to life...</p></div>
<div class="indent1"><span class="nm">(k)</span><p>This includes the leg above the knee. (Our Mishnah is unlike R. Shimon, who says that one can live without this.)</p></div>
<div class="subject"><span class="nm">4)</span><p>ERCHIN OF A HALF</p></div>
<div class="indent1"><span class="nm">(a)</span><p><span class="cl">(Mishnah):</span> If one said "half my Erech is Alai"...</p></div>
<div class="indent1"><span class="nm">(b)</span><p><span class="cl">(Beraisa):</span> If one said "half my Erech is Alai," he pays half his Erech;</p></div>
<div class="indent1"><span class="nm">(c)</span><p>R. Yosi b'Rebbi Yehudah says, he is Lokeh (lashed) and pays his full Erech.</p></div>
<div class="indent1"><span class="nm">(d)</span><p><span class="cl">Question:</span> Why is he lashed?!</p></div>
<div class="indent1"><span class="nm">(e)</span><p><span class="cl">Answer (Rav Papa):</span> He means that he is "smitten" with a Chiyuv to pay his full Erech.</p></div>
<div class="indent1"><span class="nm">(f)</span><p><span class="cl">Question:</span> What is the reason?</p></div>
<div class="indent1"><span class="nm">(g)</span><p><span class="cl">Answer:</span> This is a Gezeirah due to one who says "the Erech of half of me is Alai";</p></div>
<div class="indent2"><span class="nm">1.</span><p>The latter must pay his full Erech, for one cannot live missing half of himself.</p></div>
<div class="indent1"><span class="nm">(h)</span><p><span class="cl">(Mishnah):</span> If one said "half my Damim is Alai," he pays half his value. If he said "the Damim of half of me is Alai," he pays his full value. (Tosfos - R. Yosi b'Rebbi Yehudah also decrees in the case of "half my Damim".</p></div>
<div class="indent1"><span class="nm">(i)</span><p><span class="cl">Question:</span> What is the reason?</p></div>
<div class="indent1"><span class="nm">(j)</span><p><span class="cl">Answer:</span> It says "Neder b'Erkecha Nefashos."</p></div>
<div class="indent1"><span class="nm">(k)</span><p><span class="cl">(Mishnah):</span> The general rule is, something essential to life...</p></div>
<div class="indent1"><span class="nm">(l)</span><p>This includes the leg above the knee.</p></div>
<div class="indent1"><span class="nm">(m)</span><p><span class="cl">(Beraisa - R. Meir):</span> If one said "half the Erech of this Kli is Alai," he pays its value;</p></div>
<div class="indent1"><span class="nm">(n)</span><p>Chachamim say, his words do not take effect.</p></div>
<div class="indent1"><span class="nm">(o)</span><p><span class="cl">Question (Abaye and Rabanan):</span> Granted, R. Meir holds that one never says meaningless words (to Hekdesh. We must interpret the person's words in a way that obligates himself), whether he was Ma'arich a whole Kli or half;</p></div>
<div class="indent2"><span class="nm">1.</span><p>However, what is Chachamim's reason?</p></div>
<div class="indent3"><span class="nm">i.</span><p>If they hold that one (sometimes) says meaningless words, they should exempt even one who is Ma'arich a whole Kli;</p></div>
<div class="indent3"><span class="nm">ii.</span><p>If they agree that one never says meaningless words, they should also obligate one who is Ma'arich half a Kli!</p></div>
<div class="indent1"><span class="nm">(p)</span><p><span class="cl">Answer (Rabah):</span> Chachamim hold like R. Meir and like R. Shimon:</p></div>
<div class="indent2"><span class="nm">1.</span><p>They agree with R. Meir that one does not say meaningless words;</p></div>
<div class="indent2"><span class="nm">2.</span><p>They hold like R. Shimon, who exempts one who vowed abnormally;</p></div>
<div class="indent3"><span class="nm">i.</span><p>It is normal to vow to give the value of a whole Kli, but not of half a Kli.</p></div>
<div class="subject"><span class="nm">5)</span><p>WHEN HEIRS OF THE NODER MUST PAY</p></div>
<div class="indent1"><span class="nm">(a)</span><p><span class="cl">(Mishnah):</span> If Reuven said "the Erech of Ploni is Alai," and Reuven died...</p></div>
<div class="indent1"><span class="nm">(b)</span><p><span class="cl">Question:</span> (We must say that Reuven's heirs pay the Erech because) the case is, Beis Din obligated him;</p></div>
<div class="indent2"><span class="nm">1.</span><p>This is just like the Reisha ("Erki Alai")!</p></div>
<div class="indent1"><span class="nm">(c)</span><p><span class="cl">Answer:</span> There is a Chidush in the Seifa. If he said "Demai Ploni Alai," and Reuven died, his heirs pay:</p></div>
<div class="bbbline">20b----------------------------------------20b</p></div>
<div class="indent2"><span class="nm">1.</span><p>One might have thought that since Beis Din did not estimate Ploni's value in Reuven's lifetime, Reuven's property is not Meshu'abad;</p></div>
<div class="indent2"><span class="nm">2.</span><p>The Seifa teaches that this is not so. Since Beis Din obligated him, his property is Meshu'abad. The assessment of Ploni merely reveals the amount.</p></div>
<div class="subject"><span class="nm">6)</span><p>ACHARAYUS</p></div>
<div class="indent1"><span class="nm">(a)</span><p><span class="cl">(Mishnah):</span> If one said "this ox is an Olah," or "this house is a Korban" (i.e. Hekdesh Bedek ha'Bayis), and the ox died or the house fell, he is exempt;</p></div>
<div class="indent1"><span class="nm">(b)</span><p>If he said "this ox is Alai an Olah," or, "this house is Alai a Korban," and it died or fell, he is liable.</p></div>
<div class="indent1"><span class="nm">(c)</span><p><span class="cl">(Gemara - Rav Chiya bar Rav):</span> This is only if he said "Demei (the value of) this ox is Alai an Olah." If he said "this <i>ox</i> is Alai an Olah," he does not accept Acharayus;</p></div>
<div class="indent2"><span class="nm">1.</span><p>"Alai" means 'I must exert myself to offer it.'</p></div>
<div class="indent1"><span class="nm">(d)</span><p><span class="cl">Question (Beraisa):</span> If one said "this ox is an Olah," it is Hekdesh, Me'ilah applies to it, and he has no Acharayus if it dies or is stolen;</p></div>
<div class="indent2"><span class="nm">1.</span><p>If he said "this ox is Alai an Olah," it is Hekdesh, Me'ilah applies to it; he has Acharayus for death and theft.</p></div>
<div class="indent1"><span class="nm">(e)</span><p><span class="cl">Answer:</span> Also the text of the Mishnah also did not say "Demei," yet Rav Chiya answered that the case is that he said Demei;</p></div>
<div class="indent2"><span class="nm">1.</span><p>He can answer the Beraisa the same way!</p></div>
<div class="indent1"><span class="nm">(f)</span><p><span class="cl">Question:</span> In the Seifa of the Beraisa he said Demei. This implies that in the Reisha, he did not!</p></div>
<div class="indent2"><span class="nm">1.</span><p><span class="cl">(Seifa):</span> If he said "Demei of this ox is an Olah," it is Chulin. Me'ilah does not apply to it, and he has no Acharayus for its money (i.e. after it is sold).</p></div>
<div class="indent1"><span class="nm">(g)</span><p><span class="cl">Answer:</span> In both the Reisha and Seifa, he said Demei;</p></div>
<div class="indent2"><span class="nm">1.</span><p>In the Reisha, he was Makdish the ox (now) for its value. In the Seifa, he said that its money will become Hekdesh <i>when it will be sold</i>.</p></div>
