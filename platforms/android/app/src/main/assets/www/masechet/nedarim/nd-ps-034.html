<p class="bas subject"><span class="nm">1)</span>RETURNING AN <i>AVEIDAH</i> (cont.)</p>
<p class="bas indent1"><span class="nm">(a)</span><span class="cl">(Mishnah):</span> In a place where people pay for returning Aveidos, this amount is given to Hekdesh.</p>
<p class="bas indent1"><span class="nm">(b)</span><span class="cl">Version #1 (our text, Tosfos) Question:</span> We understand according to the second opinion, who permits even when each is Mudar from the other. (The loser cannot take the money, nor can he pardon the finder from the usual payment, so the money must go to Hekdesh.)</p>
<p class="bas indent2"><span class="nm">1.</span>But according to the first opinion, only Shimon (who is not Mudar) can return it. He can take the payment. Why must it go to Hekdesh?</p>
<p class="bas indent1"><span class="nm">(c)</span><span class="cl">Answer:</span> It refers to one case (Shimon refuses to take the payment. Since he may not benefit Reuven by pardoning the payment, it must go to Hekdesh.)</p>
<p class="bas indent1"><span class="nm">(d)</span><span class="cl">Version #2 (Ran) Question:</span> We understand according to the first opinion, who permits only Shimon to return to Reuven. (If Shimon refuses to take the money, he may not benefit Reuven by pardoning the usual payment, so) Reuven must give the payment to Hekdesh.</p>
<p class="bas indent2"><span class="nm">1.</span>But the latter opinion allows either to return to the other. Why must the payment (always) go to Hekdesh? (Ran's teachers - when Reuven returns, Shimon may keep the payment! Ran - Reuven may take the payment, i.e. compensation for wages he lost due to returning the Aveidah. This is not considered benefit.)</p>
<p class="bas indent1"><span class="nm">(e)</span><span class="cl">Answer:</span> The Seifa requires giving the payment to Hekdesh only in one case, i.e. when Shimon returns.</p>
<p class="bas indent1"><span class="nm">(f)</span><span class="cl">Version #2 (R. Ami or R. Asi):</span> Reuven (the Mudar) may return Shimon's Aveidah.</p>
<p class="bas indent2"><span class="nm">1.</span>It is rare that one saves money through Rav Yosef's law, so we are not concerned for this;</p>
<p class="bas indent2"><span class="nm">2.</span>Shimon may not return Reuven's object, for this benefits Reuven.</p>
<p class="bas indent1"><span class="nm">(g)</span><span class="cl">(The other of R. Ami and R. Asi):</span> Even Shimon may return. (He does not give to him anything,) he merely returns Reuven's property to him.</p>
<p class="bas indent1"><span class="nm">(h)</span><span class="cl">(Mishnah):</span> In a place where people receive money for returning a lost object, this amount is given to Hekdesh.</p>
<p class="bas indent1"><span class="nm">(i)</span><span class="cl">Question:</span> According to the second opinion, we can answer like above (e).</p>
<p class="bas indent2"><span class="nm">1.</span>But according to the first opinion, only Reuven may return. Shimon can keep the payment. Why must it go to Hekdesh?</p>
<p class="bas indent1"><span class="nm">(j)</span>This is left difficult.</p>
<p class="bas bbbline">34b----------------------------------------34b</p>
<p class="bas subject"><span class="nm">2)</span>DOES A VOW FORBID SOMETHING EVEN AFTER THE OWNER DOES NOT OWN IT?</p>
<p class="bas indent1"><span class="nm">(a)</span><span class="cl">(Rava):</span> An ownerless loaf was in front of Reuven. Reuven made it Hekdesh, then took it.</p>
<p class="bas indent2"><span class="nm">1.</span>If he took it to eat it, he transgresses Me'ilah (benefiting from Hekdesh) for the full value of the loaf;</p>
<p class="bas indent2"><span class="nm">2.</span>If he took it so that his children would inherit it, he transgresses Me'ilah according to his benefit (i.e. how much he would pay in order that they should inherit it).</p>
<p class="bas indent1"><span class="nm">(b)</span><span class="cl">Question (Rav Chiya bar Avin):</span> If Shimon said to Levi 'my loaf is forbidden to you', and then he gave it to him, what is the law?</p>
<p class="bas indent2"><span class="nm">1.</span>Does 'my loaf' mean 'as long as it is in my possession'?</p>
<p class="bas indent2"><span class="nm">2.</span>Or, since he said 'to you', it is like Hekdesh to Levi and always forbidden.</p>
<p class="bas indent1"><span class="nm">(c)</span><span class="cl">Answer (Rava):</span> Clearly, it is forbidden to Levi.</p>
<p class="bas indent2"><span class="nm">1.</span>If it were permitted, why did he say 'my loaf'? Will you say that he forbade it only if Levi will steal it?!</p>
<p class="bas indent1"><span class="nm">(d)</span><span class="cl">Rejection (R. Chiya bar Avin):</span> Really, you can say that it is permitted. 'My loaf' forbids it if Shimon will invite Levi to eat from it.</p>
