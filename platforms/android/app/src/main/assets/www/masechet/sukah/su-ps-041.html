<div class="subject"><span class="nm">1)</span><p>CHILUL SHEVI'IS</p></div>
<div class="indent1"><span class="nm">(a)</span><p><span class="cl">(R. Ashi):</span> R. Elazar and R. Yochanan are only arguing about Chilul of the actual Shemitah produce (Pri Rishon) while the Pri Sheni can surely be Mechulal by either means (purchase or Chilul).</p></div>
<div class="indent2"><span class="nm">1.</span><p><span class="cl">Question:</span> What of the multiple references to Lakach in the Beraisa?</p></div>
<div class="indent2"><span class="nm">2.</span><p><span class="cl">Answer:</span> They are only to be consistent with the Reisha (regarding Pri Rishon).</p></div>
<div class="indent1"><span class="nm">(b)</span><p><span class="cl">Question:</span> But the Beraisa requires a person with Shevi'is coins (which must be Pri Sheni) to redeem them only through a purchase (but not by Chilul)!?</p></div>
<div class="indent1"><span class="nm">(c)</span><p><span class="cl">Answer (R. Ashi):</span> Rather, the Machlokes is by Pri Sheni, whereas Pri Rishon must only be through purchase.</p></div>
<div class="indent2"><span class="nm">1.</span><p><span class="cl">Question:</span> What of the Beraisa which teaches that Shevi'is and Ma'aser Sheni may be Mechulal on an animal (like R. Yochanan that Shevi'is produce may be redeemed through Chilul)!?</p></div>
<div class="indent2"><span class="nm">2.</span><p><span class="cl">Answer:</span> Shevi'is means <i>funds</i> of Shevi'is.</p></div>
<div class="indent2"><span class="nm">3.</span><p>If the Shevi'is were referring to actual produce, then Ma'aser Sheni would also mean actual produce, which, we know, may only be Mechulal onto coins.</p></div>
<div class="subject"><span class="nm">2)</span><p>MISHNAH: WHEN THE LULAV IS TAKEN</p></div>
<div class="indent1"><span class="nm">(a)</span><p>During the Z'man ha'Bayis the Lulav was taken all seven days, while outside it is taken only on the first day.</p></div>
<div class="indent1"><span class="nm">(b)</span><p>After the Churban, R. Yochanan b. Zakai instituted that it is taken all seven days Zecher l'Mikdash.</p></div>
<div class="indent1"><span class="nm">(c)</span><p>Another Zecher l'Mikdash is the prohibition of Chadash for all of the 16th of Nisan.</p></div>
<div class="subject"><span class="nm">3)</span><p>ZECHER L'MIKDASH</p></div>
<div class="indent1"><span class="nm">(a)</span><p><span class="cl">Question:</span> What is the source for making a Zecher l'Mikdash?</p></div>
<div class="indent1"><span class="nm">(b)</span><p><span class="cl">Answer (R. Yochanan):</span> The Navi complains that none are "Doresh" the memory of the Mikdash.</p></div>
<div class="subject"><span class="nm">4)</span><p>CHADASH ON THE 16TH OF NISAN</p></div>
<div class="indent1"><span class="nm">(a)</span><p><span class="cl">Question:</span> Why is the 16th prohibited?</p></div>
<div class="indent1"><span class="nm">(b)</span><p><span class="cl">Answer:</span> Lest an error be made when the Bais ha'Mikdash is built (if the previous year it became permitted in the morning, they might not realize that the Omer is now the Matir for Chadash, not the dawning day).</p></div>
<div class="indent1"><span class="nm">(c)</span><p><span class="cl">Question:</span> Whenever the Mikdash will be built, it will not be prohibited later than midday on the 16th!?</p></div>
<div class="indent1"><span class="nm">(d)</span><p><span class="cl">Answer:</span> Our concern is in the case where the Mikdash is built on the night of the 16th, resulting in a delay in the bringing of the Omer until late on the 16th.</p></div>
<div class="indent1"><span class="nm">(e)</span><p><span class="cl">Answer (R. Nachman b. Yitzchak):</span> R. Yochanan b. Zakai's concern was because he anticipated the opinion of R. Yehudah who holds that mid'Oraisa Chadash is prohibited the entire 16th.</p></div>
<div class="bbbline">41b----------------------------------------41b</p></div>
<div class="indent2"><span class="nm">1.</span><p>R. Yehudah learns this from the words Ad Etzem.</p></div>
<div class="indent2"><span class="nm">2.</span><p>Ad includes the day itself.</p></div>
<div class="indent1"><span class="nm">(f)</span><p><span class="cl">Question:</span> But we find that R. Yehudah states his position as <i>juxtaposed</i> to that of R. Yochanan, implying that he argues!?</p></div>
<div class="indent1"><span class="nm">(g)</span><p><span class="cl">Answer:</span> R. Yehudah misunderstood the position of R. Yochanan b. Zakai (erroneously defining 'Hiskin' as meaning that the prohibition is d'Rabanan only).</p></div>
<div class="indent1"><span class="nm">(h)</span><p><span class="cl">Question:</span> But the Mishnah does say Hiskin!?</p></div>
<div class="indent1"><span class="nm">(i)</span><p><span class="cl">Answer:</span> It means that he then taught the proper interpretation of the Pasuk.</p></div>
<div class="subject"><span class="nm">5)</span><p>MISHNAH: LULAV ON SHABBOS</p></div>
<div class="indent1"><span class="nm">(a)</span><p>When the first Yom Tov falls on Shabbos the people must bring their Lulavim before Shabbos.</p></div>
<div class="indent1"><span class="nm">(b)</span><p>The next day each one must make sure to take his own, since the Chachamim taught that one may only be Yotzei with his own.</p></div>
<div class="indent1"><span class="nm">(c)</span><p>The rest of the week one may be Yotzei with a borrowed Lulav.</p></div>
<div class="indent1"><span class="nm">(d)</span><p><span class="cl">(R. Yosi):</span> If one accidentally carried his Lulav on the first Yom Tov he is Patur from a Chatas because he was engrossed in the performance of a Mitzvah.</p></div>
<div class="subject"><span class="nm">6)</span><p>ONE'S OWN LULAV</p></div>
<div class="indent1"><span class="nm">(a)</span><p><span class="cl">Question:</span> What is the source for this requirement?</p></div>
<div class="indent1"><span class="nm">(b)</span><p><span class="cl">Answer:</span> The Rabanan interpret u'Lekachtem Lachem to exclude a borrowed or stolen Lulav.</p></div>
<div class="indent2"><span class="nm">1.</span><p>It may be transferred as a gift.</p></div>
<div class="indent2"><span class="nm">2.</span><p>This is seen in the incident of R. Gamliel who gave his expensive Lulav to the Chachamim who were with him on board (who then gave it back to him).</p></div>
<div class="indent2"><span class="nm">3.</span><p><span class="cl">Question:</span> Why did we need to be taught that they gave it back to R. Gamliel?</p></div>
<div class="indent2"><span class="nm">4.</span><p><span class="cl">Answer:</span> To teach that a gift given on condition of its return is a valid gift (if subsequently returned) as we see was Rava's practice.</p></div>
<div class="indent2"><span class="nm">5.</span><p><span class="cl">Question:</span> Why do we need to be taught that R. Gamliel spent 1000 Zuz on his Esrog and Lulav?</p></div>
<div class="indent2"><span class="nm">6.</span><p><span class="cl">Answer:</span> To teach us how precious the Mitzvah was in his eyes.</p></div>
<div class="subject"><span class="nm">7)</span><p>ACTIVITIES PERFORMED WITH LULAV IN HAND</p></div>
<div class="indent1"><span class="nm">(a)</span><p><span class="cl">(Mar b. Ameimar):</span> Father would pray with his Lulav.</p></div>
<div class="indent1"><span class="nm">(b)</span><p><span class="cl">Question:</span> But the Beraisa teaches that one must not hold anything of Kedushah in his hand during Tefilah (and Shmuel extends this to anything which he would be afraid to drop)!?</p></div>
<div class="indent1"><span class="nm">(c)</span><p><span class="cl">Answer:</span> There is no Mitzvah to hold those items (unlike the Lulav which thus does not create a distraction).</p></div>
<div class="indent1"><span class="nm">(d)</span><p><span class="cl">(Beraisa-R. Elazar b. Tzadok):</span> The custom of the people of Yerushalayim was to carry the Lulav through every task with the exception of Nesiyas Kapayim and learning Torah, due to their love of Mitzvos.</p></div>
