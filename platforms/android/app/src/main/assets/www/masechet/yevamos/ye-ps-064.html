<div class="subject"><span class="nm">1)</span><p>BRINGING THE DIVINE PRESENCE</p></div>
<div class="indent1"><span class="nm">(a)</span><p><span class="cl">(Beraisa):</span> "Uv'Nucho Yomar Shuvah Hash-m <i>Rivevos Alfei</i> Yisrael" teaches that the Shechinah does not rest on less than 22,000 Yisraelim (two Revavos and two thousands);</p></div>
<div class="indent2"><span class="nm">1.</span><p>If there were 21,999 Yisraelim, and a man did not engage in procreation, he caused the Shechinah to depart from Yisrael!</p></div>
<div class="indent1"><span class="nm">(b)</span><p>Aba Chanan says, he (one who does not engage in procreation) is Chayav Misah. "They (Nadav and Avihu) did not have children" - had they had children, they would not have died;</p></div>
<div class="indent1"><span class="nm">(c)</span><p>Others say, he causes the Divine Presence to depart from Yisrael (through reducing the population) - "Lihyos Lecha l'Eilokim ul'Zar'acha Acharecha";</p></div>
<div class="indent2"><span class="nm">1.</span><p>When you have children, the Shechinah dwells. When you do not, will it dwell on sticks and rocks?!</p></div>
<div class="subject"><span class="nm">2)</span><p>A MAN MUST MARRY A WOMAN WHO CAN BEAR CHILDREN</p></div>
<div class="indent1"><span class="nm">(a)</span><p><span class="cl">(Mishnah):</span> If a man married a woman and she did not give birth in 10 years, he may not neglect Peru u'Rvu;</p></div>
<div class="indent1"><span class="nm">(b)</span><p>If he divorced her, she may marry another man, and the latter man may keep her for 10 years without children;</p></div>
<div class="indent2"><span class="nm">1.</span><p>If she miscarried, we count 10 years from the miscarriage.</p></div>
<div class="indent1"><span class="nm">(c)</span><p><span class="cl">(Gemara - Beraisa):</span> If a man married a woman and she did not give birth in 10 years, he must divorce her and pay a Kesuvah. Perhaps (she is not sterile, just) he did not merit to have children through her;</p></div>
<div class="indent1"><span class="nm">(d)</span><p>We have no proof from the Torah, but there is a hint - "At the end of 10 years that Avram lived in Eretz Kena'an (he married Hagar)". This teaches that time in Chutz la'Aretz does not count (after one comes to Eretz Yisrael);</p></div>
<div class="indent1"><span class="nm">(e)</span><p>Therefore (since we rely on the merit of Eretz Yisrael, we also rely on excuses why she did not conceive until now, e.g.) if either of them was sick, or if both were in jail, this does not count towards the 10 years. (Me'iri - it is possible, but not normal, for them to have relations in jail. All the more so, if only one of them was in jail, the time does not count!)</p></div>
<div class="indent1"><span class="nm">(f)</span><p><span class="cl">Question (Rava):</span> Why don't we learn from Yitzchak? "Yitzchak was 40 years old when he married Rivkah", and "He was 60 when she gave birth"!</p></div>
<div class="indent1"><span class="nm">(g)</span><p><span class="cl">Answer (Rav Nachman):</span> Yitzchak was sterile.</p></div>
<div class="indent1"><span class="nm">(h)</span><p><span class="cl">Question (Rava):</span> Also Avraham was sterile!</p></div>
<div class="indent1"><span class="nm">(i)</span><p><span class="cl">Answer (Rav Nachman):</span> The latter verse about Yitzchak is needed for R. Chiya bar Aba's teaching (but the verse about Avram is solely to hint to the law of 10 years).</p></div>
<div class="indent2"><span class="nm">1.</span><p><span class="cl">(R. Chiya bar Aba):</span> The years of Yishmael were counted in order to reveal about Yakov's years (his age when he went to Lavan - see Rashi here and Bereishis 28:9).</p></div>
<div class="subject"><span class="nm">3)</span><p>THE AVOS WERE STERILE</p></div>
<div class="indent1"><span class="nm">(a)</span><p><span class="cl">(R. Yitzchak):</span> Yitzchak was sterile - "Yitzchak prayed to Hash-m Nochach (corresponding to) his wife";</p></div>
<div class="indent2"><span class="nm">1.</span><p>It does not say <i>for</i> his wife, rather, <i>corresponding to</i> her. This teaches that they were both sterile (and requesting mercy).</p></div>
<div class="indent1"><span class="nm">(b)</span><p><span class="cl">Question:</span> If both prayed, why does it say "Hash-m hearkened to <i>him</i>"? It should say 'to <i>them</i>'!</p></div>
<div class="indent1"><span class="nm">(c)</span><p><span class="cl">Answer:</span> The prayer of a Tzadik Ben Tzadik is much greater than the prayer of a Tzadik whose father is evil.</p></div>
<div class="indent1"><span class="nm">(d)</span><p><span class="cl">(R. Yitzchak):</span> The Avos were sterile, because Hash-m desires the prayers of Tzadikim.</p></div>
<div class="indent1"><span class="nm">(e)</span><p><span class="cl">(R. Yitzchak):</span> The prayers of Tzadikim are compared to a pitchfork;</p></div>
<div class="indent2"><span class="nm">1.</span><p>Just like a pitchfork moves grain from one place to another, also prayers of Tzadikim switch the Midos that Hash-m uses, from the Midah of anger to the Midah of mercy.</p></div>
<div class="indent1"><span class="nm">(f)</span><p><span class="cl">(R. Ami):</span> Avraham and Sarah were Tumtumim (their genitals were initially covered). "Look to the rock from which you were carved, and to the hammer from which your opening was made." "Look to Avraham and Sarah who gave birth to you."</p></div>
<div class="bbbline">64b----------------------------------------64b</p></div>
<div class="indent1"><span class="nm">(g)</span><p><span class="cl">(Rav Nachman):</span> Sarah was an Ailonis. "Sarai was sterile, she had no child" - she lacked even the housing (womb) for a child.</p></div>
<div class="subject"><span class="nm">4)</span><p>A STERILE WIFE</p></div>
<div class="indent1"><span class="nm">(a)</span><p><span class="cl">(Rav):</span> The Mishnah applied to the early generations, who lived long. Nowadays one may wait two and a half years, the time of three pregnancies.</p></div>
<div class="indent1"><span class="nm">(b)</span><p><span class="cl">(Rabah, citing Rav Nachman):</span> One may wait three years, corresponding to three Pekidos (decrees of prophecy);</p></div>
<div class="indent2"><span class="nm">1.</span><p>On Rosh Hashanah, pregnancy was decreed for Sarah, Rachel and Chanah.</p></div>
<div class="indent1"><span class="nm">(c)</span><p><span class="cl">Objection (Rabah):</span> These laws are incorrect!</p></div>
<div class="indent2"><span class="nm">1.</span><p>Rebbi codified our Mishnah, and peoples' years were already shortened in David's days - "The days of our years are 70 years"!</p></div>
<div class="indent1"><span class="nm">(d)</span><p><span class="cl">Question:</span> The Beraisa says that (he must pay a Kesuvah, for) perhaps he did not merit to have children through her. Perhaps she did not merit to conceive from him!</p></div>
<div class="indent1"><span class="nm">(e)</span><p><span class="cl">Answer:</span> Since she is not commanded about Peru u'Rvu, she would not be punished through inability to fulfill it.</p></div>
<div class="indent1"><span class="nm">(f)</span><p><span class="cl">Objection:</span> Rabanan told R. Aba bar Zavda that he should marry and have children, and he replied that had he merited, he would have had children through his first wife!</p></div>
<div class="indent1"><span class="nm">(g)</span><p><span class="cl">Answer:</span> He dispelled them off with empty words. Really, he became sterile through (delaying urinating during) Rav Huna's class.</p></div>
<div class="indent2"><span class="nm">1.</span><p>Rav Gidal, R. Chelbo, and Rav Sheshes became sterile through Rav Huna's class.</p></div>
<div class="indent2"><span class="nm">2.</span><p>Rav Acha bar Yakov was seized by a sickness (from withholding urine, which can cause sterility). They hung him from a tree, and green matter exuded from him.</p></div>
<div class="indent2"><span class="nm">3.</span><p><span class="cl">Rav Acha bar Yakov:</span> I was among 60 elders who attended Rav Huna's class. All became sterile except for myself - Chachmah gives life to those who have it! (He knew how to cure himself.)</p></div>
<div class="subject"><span class="nm">5)</span><p>A WOMAN WIDOWED TWICE</p></div>
<div class="indent1"><span class="nm">(a)</span><p><span class="cl">(Mishnah):</span> If he divorced her, she may remarry...</p></div>
<div class="indent1"><span class="nm">(b)</span><p><span class="cl">Inference:</span> She may marry a second man, but not a third. Our Mishnah is like Rebbi:</p></div>
<div class="indent2"><span class="nm">1.</span><p><span class="cl">(Beraisa #1 - Rebbi):</span> If a woman circumcised two of her sons and they died, she should not circumcise her third son;</p></div>
<div class="indent2"><span class="nm">2.</span><p>R. Shimon ben Gamliel says, she circumcises the third, but not a fourth.</p></div>
<div class="indent1"><span class="nm">(c)</span><p>Another Beraisa (#2) switches the opinions.</p></div>
<div class="indent1"><span class="nm">(d)</span><p><span class="cl">Question:</span> Which was taught later?</p></div>
<div class="indent1"><span class="nm">(e)</span><p><span class="cl">Answer (R. Chiya bar Aba):</span> There was a case of four sisters in Tzipori. Three circumcised their sons, and all died. The fourth came to R. Shimon ben Gamliel. He told her not to circumcise her son. (This supports Beraisa #1; it was taught later).</p></div>
<div class="indent1"><span class="nm">(f)</span><p><span class="cl">Objection:</span> Perhaps he would have told also the third not to circumcise!</p></div>
<div class="indent1"><span class="nm">(g)</span><p><span class="cl">Question:</span> If so, what do we learn from R. Chiya's testimony?</p></div>
<div class="indent1"><span class="nm">(h)</span><p><span class="cl">Answer:</span> He teaches that a Chazakah may be established through sisters.</p></div>
<div class="indent1"><span class="nm">(i)</span><p><span class="cl">(Rava):</span> Now that we see that sisters make a Chazakah, a man should not marry a woman from a family of epileptics or lepers;</p></div>
<div class="indent2"><span class="nm">1.</span><p>This only applies if there are three in the family.</p></div>
<div class="indent1"><span class="nm">(j)</span><p><span class="cl">Question:</span> What was the conclusion?</p></div>
<div class="indent1"><span class="nm">(k)</span><p><span class="cl">Answer (R. Yitzchak bar Yosef):</span> A case occurred in which two sons of a woman died through circumcision. She came to R. Yochanan on Yom Kipur that fell on Shabbos to ask about her third son. He told her to circumcise him.</p></div>
<div class="indent1"><span class="nm">(l)</span><p><span class="cl">Abaye:</span> You permit an Isur and a danger!</p></div>
<div class="indent2"><span class="nm">1.</span><p>Abaye relied on this and married Chomah, who had been widowed twice; Abaye also died in her lifetime.</p></div>
<div class="indent1"><span class="nm">(m)</span><p><span class="cl">Question (Rava):</span> Does anyone jeopardize his life like this?!</p></div>
<div class="indent2"><span class="nm">1.</span><p><span class="cl">Objection #1:</span> Abaye himself said that we can rely on Avin, but not on Yitzchak!</p></div>
<div class="indent3"><span class="nm">i.</span><p>Avin reviews his learning, but Yitzchak does not!</p></div>
<div class="indent2"><span class="nm">2.</span><p><span class="cl">Objection #2:</span> They argue about circumcision. Do they argue about marriage?!</p></div>
<div class="indent2"><span class="nm">3.</span><p><span class="cl">Answer to Objection #2:</span> Yes!</p></div>
<div class="indent3"><span class="nm">i.</span><p><span class="cl">(Beraisa - Rebbi):</span> If she married a man, and he died; a second man, and he died; she may not marry again;</p></div>
<div class="indent3"><span class="nm">ii.</span><p>R. Shimon ben Gamliel says, she may marry a third man, but not a fourth.</p></div>
<div class="indent1"><span class="nm">(n)</span><p><span class="cl">Question:</span> Granted, regarding circumcision, some families have weak blood and others have strong blood;</p></div>
<div class="indent2"><span class="nm">1.</span><p>However, why should a woman have a Chazakah that her husbands will die?</p></div>
<div class="indent1"><span class="nm">(o)</span><p><span class="cl">Answer #1 (R. Mordecai):</span> Bi'ah with her causes her husband to die.</p></div>
<div class="indent1"><span class="nm">(p)</span><p><span class="cl">Answer #2 (Rav Ashi):</span> Her Mazal causes him to die.</p></div>
<div class="indent2"><span class="nm">1.</span><p>The difference between these answers is if her husband died during Kidushin, or her husband fell from the roof (these can be attributed only to Mazal).</p></div>
<div class="indent1"><span class="nm">(q)</span><p><span class="cl">Rav Yosef brei d'Rava:</span> I asked Rav Yosef if the Halachah follows Rebbi; he said that yes; another time, I asked if the Halachah follows R. Shimon ben Gamliel, and he said yes!</p></div>
<div class="indent2"><span class="nm">1.</span><p>Was he mocking me?</p></div>
<div class="indent1"><span class="nm">(r)</span><p><span class="cl">Rava:</span> No. Regarding marriage and lashes, the Stam Mishnah is like Rebbi. Regarding Vestos (expected menstrual periods) and an ox Mu'ad (established) to gore, the Stam Mishnah is like R. Shimon ben Gamliel.</p></div>
<div class="indent2"><span class="nm">1.</span><p>We taught about marriage above (she may marry a second time, but not a third).</p></div>
<div class="indent2"><span class="nm">2.</span><p><span class="cl">Lashes - (Mishnah):</span> If one was lashed twice (for Chayavei Kerisos), Beis Din locks him in a cell and feeds him barley, which causes his stomach to burst.</p></div>
<div class="indent2"><span class="nm">3.</span><p><span class="cl">Vestos - (Mishnah):</span> A woman establishes a Veses after three periods (at the time of the Veses). She only uproots a Veses after three times when she does not have a period at the time of the Veses.</p></div>
<div class="indent2"><span class="nm">4.</span><p><span class="cl">A Mu'ad ox - (Mishnah):</span> An ox is established to be Mu'ad after three times.</p></div>
