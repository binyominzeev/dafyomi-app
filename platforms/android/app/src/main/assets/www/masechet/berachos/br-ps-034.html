<p class="bas indent1"><span class="nm">(a)</span><span class="cl">(Mishnah):</span> (Saying, "Good people will bless you," is the way of heretics -- some delete this from the text.)</p>
<p class="bas indent1"><span class="nm">(b)</span>If the one leading the prayer errs, someone else takes his place; the latter should not decline to do so at this time.</p>
<p class="bas indent1"><span class="nm">(c)</span>The latter begins from the beginning of the blessing in which the first erred.</p>
<p class="bas indent1"><span class="nm">(d)</span>The one leading the prayer does not answer "Amen" after Birkas Kohanim, lest he get confused. (We assume that he prays by heart, without a prayer book);</p>
<p class="bas indent2"><span class="nm">1.</span>If he is the only Kohen, he does not recite Birkas Kohanim.</p>
<p class="bas indent2"><span class="nm">2.</span>If he is sure that he can recite Birkas Kohanim and resume the prayer, he may do so.</p>
<p class="bas indent1"><span class="nm">(e)</span><span class="cl">(Gemara - Beraisa):</span> If one is asked to lead the prayer, he should [feel that he is not worthy to, and] decline;</p>
<p class="bas indent2"><span class="nm">1.</span>If he does not decline, he is like a cooked food to which salt was not added; if he declines too much, he is like a food that was ruined on account of too much salt;</p>
<p class="bas indent2"><span class="nm">2.</span>Rather, the first time [he is asked] he should decline; the second time he should make movements like one about to get up; the third time, he should go.</p>
<p class="bas indent1"><span class="nm">(f)</span><span class="cl">(Beraisa):</span> There are three things that are bad in large amounts but good in small amounts -- yeast (to ferment dough), salt, and refusal.</p>
<p class="bas subject"><span class="nm">2)</span>THE THREE PARTS OF <i>TEFILAH</i></p>
<p class="bas indent1"><span class="nm">(a)</span><span class="cl">(Rav Huna):</span> If one erred in one of the first three blessings, he must return to the beginning of Shemoneh Esreh;</p>
<p class="bas indent2"><span class="nm">1.</span>If he erred in one of the middle blessings, he returns to Chonen ha'Da'as (the first of the middle blessings); if one erred in one of the last three blessings, he returns to Avodah (the first of the last three).</p>
<p class="bas indent1"><span class="nm">(b)</span><span class="cl">(R. Asi):</span> We are not concerned for the order of the middle blessings (if one was skipped, it can be said out of place).</p>
<p class="bas indent1"><span class="nm">(c)</span><span class="cl">Question (Rav Sheshes, against Rav Huna - Mishnah):</span> The latter begins from the beginning of the blessing in which the first erred.</p>
<p class="bas indent1"><span class="nm">(d)</span><span class="cl">Answer:</span> The middle blessings are all considered like one (therefore, "the beginning" refers to Chonen ha'Da'as).</p>
<p class="bas indent1"><span class="nm">(e)</span><span class="cl">(Rav Yehudah):</span> One should not request his needs in the first three or last three blessings, only in the middle blessings.</p>
<p class="bas indent2"><span class="nm">1.</span><span class="cl">(R. Chanina):</span> In the first three blessings, one is like a slave recounting the praise of his Master;</p>
<p class="bas indent2"><span class="nm">2.</span>In the middle blessings, one is like a slave requesting remuneration from his Master;</p>
<p class="bas indent2"><span class="nm">3.</span>In the last three blessings, one is like a slave thanking his Master for giving to him, and he departs.</p>
<p class="bas indent1"><span class="nm">(f)</span><span class="cl">(Beraisa):</span> A case occurred, a Talmid leading the prayer in front of R. Eliezer was praying at length.</p>
<p class="bas indent2"><span class="nm">1.</span><span class="cl">The other Talmidim:</span> He is taking too long!</p>
<p class="bas indent2"><span class="nm">2.</span><span class="cl">R. Eliezer:</span> This is not as long as Moshe, who prayed for forty days and nights -- "Arba'im ha'Yom v'Es Arba'im ha'Lailah"!</p>
<p class="bas indent2"><span class="nm">3.</span>A different time, a Talmid leading the prayer in front of R. Eliezer was praying quickly.</p>
<p class="bas indent2"><span class="nm">4.</span><span class="cl">The other Talmidim:</span> He is praying too quickly!</p>
<p class="bas indent2"><span class="nm">5.</span><span class="cl">R. Eliezer:</span> This is not as short as Moshe (who said only five words in his prayer for Miriam) -- "Kel Na Refa Na Lah"!</p>
<p class="bas indent1"><span class="nm">(g)</span><span class="cl">(R. Yakov):</span> One who requests mercy for someone else need not mention the latter's name -- we find that Moshe did not mention Miriam's name.</p>
<p class="bas subject"><span class="nm">3)</span>BOWING DURING PRAYER</p>
<p class="bas indent1"><span class="nm">(a)</span><span class="cl">(Beraisa):</span> One bows in the following blessings:</p>
<p class="bas indent2"><span class="nm">1.</span>In the beginning and end of Avos (the first blessing), in the beginning and end of Modim.</p>
<p class="bas indent1"><span class="nm">(b)</span>If one wants to bow in the beginning or end of other blessings, we tell him not to.</p>
<p class="bas indent1"><span class="nm">(c)</span><span class="cl">(R. Shimon ben Pazi citing R. Yehoshua ben Levi):</span> That is the law for a commoner; a Kohen Gadol bows at the end of each blessing; the king bows at the beginning and end of each blessing.</p>
<p class="bas bbbline">34b----------------------------------------34b</p>
<p class="bas indent1"><span class="nm">(d)</span><span class="cl">(R. Yitzchak bar Nachmani citing R. Yehoshua ben Levi):</span> That is the law for a commoner; a Kohen Gadol bows in the beginning (Gra - and end) of each blessing; the king bows in the beginning and does not straighten up (until the end) -- "va'Yehi k'Chalos Shlomo l'Hispalel... Kam mi'Lifnei Mizbach Hash-m."</p>
<p class="bas indent1"><span class="nm">(e)</span><span class="cl">(Beraisa):</span> "Kidah" refers to bowing and putting one's face on the ground -- "va'Tikod Bas Sheva Apayim Eretz";</p>
<p class="bas indent2"><span class="nm">1.</span>"Kri'ah" is bending the knees -- "mi'Kero'a Al Birkav";</p>
<p class="bas indent2"><span class="nm">2.</span>"Hishtachavah" is prostrating on the hands and feet -- "l'Hishtachavos Lecha Artzah."</p>
<p class="bas indent1"><span class="nm">(f)</span><span class="cl">(R. Chiya brei d'Rav Huna):</span> I saw Abaye and Rava lean to the side (during Nefilas Apayim, i.e. Tachanun).</p>
<p class="bas indent1"><span class="nm">(g)</span><span class="cl">(Beraisa #1):</span> It is praiseworthy to bow during Hoda'ah (Modim).</p>
<p class="bas indent1"><span class="nm">(h)</span><span class="cl">Contradiction (Beraisa #2):</span> It is contemptible.</p>
<p class="bas indent1"><span class="nm">(i)</span><span class="cl">Resolution:</span> It is praiseworthy to bow at the beginning of Modim, it is contemptible to bow at the end.</p>
<p class="bas indent1"><span class="nm">(j)</span>Rava bowed at the beginning and end of Modim.</p>
<p class="bas indent1"><span class="nm">(k)</span><span class="cl">Rabanan:</span> Why did you do so?</p>
<p class="bas indent1"><span class="nm">(l)</span>(A Beraisa on 34a says that we bow in the beginning and end of Modim! Rashba deletes "beginning and end" from the text of that Beraisa. Ra'avad - that refers to Modim in Shemoneh Esreh, here we discuss "Modim d'Rabanan," which the congregation says when the Shali'ach Tzibur says Modim.)</p>
<p class="bas indent1"><span class="nm">(m)</span><span class="cl">Rava:</span> I saw Rav Nachman and Rav Sheshes do so.</p>
<p class="bas indent1"><span class="nm">(n)</span><span class="cl">Question (Beraisa #2):</span> It is contemptible to bow during Hoda'ah.</p>
<p class="bas indent1"><span class="nm">(o)</span><span class="cl">Answer:</span> There, "Hoda'ah" refers to Hallel.</p>
<p class="bas indent1"><span class="nm">(p)</span><span class="cl">Question (Beraisa #3):</span> It is contemptible to bow during Hoda'ah or during the Hoda'ah of Hallel.</p>
<p class="bas indent1"><span class="nm">(q)</span><span class="cl">Answer:</span> There, "Hoda'ah" refers to the second blessing of Birkas ha'Mazon.</p>
<p class="bas subject"><span class="nm">4)</span>A MISTAKE IN PRAYER</p>
<p class="bas indent1"><span class="nm">(a)</span><span class="cl">(Mishnah):</span> If one erred in his Shemoneh Esreh, it is a bad sign for him;</p>
<p class="bas indent1"><span class="nm">(b)</span>If a Shali'ach Tzibur erred in his Shemoneh Esreh, it is a bad sign for the congregation, for a person's Shali'ach is like himself.</p>
<p class="bas indent1"><span class="nm">(c)</span>R. Chanina ben Dosa used to pray for sick people; he would say which would live and which would not.</p>
<p class="bas indent1"><span class="nm">(d)</span><span class="cl">Talmidim:</span> How do you know who will live?</p>
<p class="bas indent1"><span class="nm">(e)</span><span class="cl">R. Chanina:</span> If my prayer flows smoothly, I know that it is accepted; if not, I know that it is not accepted.</p>
<p class="bas indent1"><span class="nm">(f)</span><span class="cl">Version #1 (Gemara) Question:</span> Where did the person err?</p>
<p class="bas indent1"><span class="nm">(g)</span><span class="cl">Answer (R. Chiya):</span> He erred in Avos.</p>
<p class="bas indent1"><span class="nm">(h)</span><span class="cl">Version #2 (Beraisa):</span> One who prays must concentrate in all the blessings; if he cannot do this, he should concentrate in one.</p>
<p class="bas indent1"><span class="nm">(i)</span><span class="cl">Question:</span> In which blessing should he concentrate?</p>
<p class="bas indent1"><span class="nm">(j)</span><span class="cl">Answer (R. Chiya):</span> He should concentrate in Avos.</p>
<p class="bas subject"><span class="nm">5)</span>FUTURE REWARD</p>
<p class="bas indent1"><span class="nm">(a)</span><span class="cl">(Mishnah):</span> R. Chanina ben Dosa... (If my Shemoneh Esreh flows smoothly, I know that it is accepted.)</p>
<p class="bas indent1"><span class="nm">(b)</span><span class="cl">Question:</span> What is the source of this?</p>
<p class="bas indent1"><span class="nm">(c)</span><span class="cl">Answer (R. Yehoshua ben Levi):</span> "Borei Niv Sefasayim (when the words flows smoothly) Shalom Shalom la'Rachok vela'Karov u'Refasiv."</p>
<p class="bas indent1"><span class="nm">(d)</span><span class="cl">(R. Chiya bar Aba):</span> All prophetic visions of future reward were only for one who marries off his daughter to a Talmid Chacham, or does business on behalf of a Talmid Chacham, or lets a Talmid Chacham benefit from his possessions;</p>
<p class="bas indent2"><span class="nm">1.</span>No prophet ever had a vision of the reward in the World to Come for a Talmid Chacham -- "Ayin Lo Ra'asah Elokim Zulasecha Ya'aseh li'Mechakeh Lo."</p>
<p class="bas indent1"><span class="nm">(e)</span><span class="cl">(R. Chiya bar Aba):</span> All prophecies of future reward were only for the time of Mashi'ach, but no prophet ever saw the reward in the World to Come -- "Ayin Lo Ra'asah...."</p>
<p class="bas indent1"><span class="nm">(f)</span>This argues with Shmuel:</p>
<p class="bas indent2"><span class="nm">1.</span><span class="cl">(Shmuel):</span> The only difference between this world and the time of Mashi'ach is that the kingdoms will cease to rule over Yisrael -- "Ki Lo Yechdal Evyon mi'Kerev ha'Aretz" (there will still be poor people).</p>
<p class="bas indent1"><span class="nm">(g)</span><span class="cl">(R. Chiya bar Aba citing R. Yochanan):</span> Prophets prophesized about the reward awaiting Ba'alei Teshuvah, but the reward for Tzadikim who never sinned is "Ayin Lo Ra'asah..."</p>
<p class="bas indent1"><span class="nm">(h)</span>He argues with R. Avahu.</p>
<p class="bas indent2"><span class="nm">1.</span><span class="cl">(R. Avahu):</span> Ba'alei Teshuvah have a greater share in the World to Come than Tzadikim who never sinned -- "Shalom Shalom la'Rachok vela'Karov," the Rachok (far) comes before the near;</p>
<p class="bas indent3"><span class="nm">i.</span>"Far" is one who was far from Hash-m (but repented), "near" is one who was always close.</p>
<p class="bas indent2"><span class="nm">2.</span>R. Yochanan explains, "Far" is one who was always far from sin, "near" is one who was close to sin and distanced himself.</p>
<p class="bas indent1"><span class="nm">(i)</span><span class="cl">Question:</span> What does "Ayin Lo Ra'asah..." mean?</p>
<p class="bas indent1"><span class="nm">(j)</span><span class="cl">Answer #1 (R. Yehoshua ben Levi):</span> This is wine that has been guarded in the grape since the six days of creation (Chidushei Torah that were never revealed to any person).</p>
<p class="bas indent1"><span class="nm">(k)</span><span class="cl">Answer #2 (R. Shmuel bar Nachmani):</span> This is Eden, no created being ever saw it.</p>
<p class="bas indent1"><span class="nm">(l)</span><span class="cl">Question:</span> Where was Adam ha'Rishon?</p>
<p class="bas indent1"><span class="nm">(m)</span><span class="cl">Answer:</span> He was in Gan Eden.</p>
<p class="bas indent1"><span class="nm">(n)</span><span class="cl">Suggestion:</span> Perhaps this is Eden itself!</p>

<p class="bas subject"><span class="nm">6)</span>R. CHANINA'S POWER OF PRAYER</p>
<p class="bas indent1"><span class="nm">(a)</span><span class="cl">(Beraisa):</span> A case occurred, R. Gamliel's son fell sick; he sent two Chachamim to R. Chanina ben Dosa to ask him to pray for him. When R. Chanina saw them coming, he went to the upper story and prayed; he came down and told them that the fever had abated.</p>
<p class="bas indent2"><span class="nm">1.</span><span class="cl">Chachamim:</span> Are you a prophet?</p>
<p class="bas indent2"><span class="nm">2.</span><span class="cl">R. Chanina:</span> I am neither a prophet nor the son of a prophet; I have a tradition, if my Shemoneh Esreh flows smoothly, it was accepted; if not, not.</p>
<p class="bas indent1"><span class="nm">(b)</span>The Chachamim wrote down what time it was; they returned to R. Gamliel, who said that this was exactly when the fever abated.</p>
<p class="bas indent1"><span class="nm">(c)</span>When R. Chanina ben Dosa went to learn from R. Yochanan ben Zakai, R. Yochanan's son fell sick; he asked R. Chanina to pray for him. R. Chanina put his head between his knees, and the son recovered.</p>
<p class="bas indent2"><span class="nm">1.</span><span class="cl">R. Yochanan:</span> I could put my head between my knees all day [and pray], and I would not be answered!</p>
