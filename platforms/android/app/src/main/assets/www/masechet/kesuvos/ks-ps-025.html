<p class="bas subject"><span class="nm">1)</span>THE POWER OF <i>CHAZAKAH</i></p>
<p class="bas indent1"><span class="nm">(a)</span><span class="cl">Question:</span> If so (there is no concern), why did R. Yosi say that Chazakah is great?</p>
<p class="bas indent1"><span class="nm">(b)</span><span class="cl">Answer #1:</span> In Bavel, they ate only Terumah mid'Rabanan. Now, they may eat Terumah mid'Oraisa.</p>
<p class="bas indent1"><span class="nm">(c)</span><span class="cl">Answer #2:</span> Also now they may eat only Terumah mid'Rabanan; lineage is established only by eating Terumah mid'Oraisa. Chazakah is great, for even though now (in Eretz Yisrael) there is reason to decree against Terumah mid'Rabanan, lest they eat Terumah mid'Oraisa, no decree was made.</p>
<p class="bas indent1"><span class="nm">(d)</span><span class="cl">Question:</span> They did eat Terumah mid'Oraisa!</p>
<p class="bas indent2"><span class="nm">1.</span>"They will not eat from Kodesh ha'Kodoshim" - from Kodshei Kodoshim they will not eat, but they will eat Terumah mid'Oraisa!</p>
<p class="bas indent1"><span class="nm">(e)</span><span class="cl">Answer:</span> Expound the verse to say "They will not eat something called Kodesh (Terumah), nor something called Kodshim (Kodshei Kodoshim)."</p>
<p class="bas subject"><span class="nm">2)</span>CAN WE ESTABLISH LINEAGE FROM <i>BIRKAS</i> <i>KOHANIM</i>?</p>
<p class="bas indent1"><span class="nm">(a)</span><span class="cl">Answer #2 (to Question 3:g, 24b - Beraisa):</span> Any of the following is a Chazakah (of Kehunah):</p>
<p class="bas indent2"><span class="nm">1.</span>Birkas Kohanim in Bavel;</p>
<p class="bas indent2"><span class="nm">2.</span>Eating Chalah in Surya;</p>
<p class="bas indent2"><span class="nm">3.</span>Receiving Matanos (the foreleg, jaw and stomach from a slaughtered animal) in big cities.</p>
<p class="bas indent2"><span class="nm">4.</span><span class="cl">Suggestion:</span> Birkas Kohanim is a Chazakah of Kehunah for lineage.</p>
<p class="bas indent1"><span class="nm">(b)</span><span class="cl">Rejection:</span> No, it is for Terumah.</p>
<p class="bas indent1"><span class="nm">(c)</span><span class="cl">Question:</span> Presumably, Birkas Kohanim in Bavel is a Chazakah just like eating Chalah in Surya (which is taught with it). The latter must be for lineage. (Chalah is just like Terumah, so we would not say that eating Chalah is a Chazakah for Terumah.)</p>
<p class="bas indent1"><span class="nm">(d)</span><span class="cl">Answer:</span> The Tana holds that Chalah is mid'Rabanan nowadays, but Terumah is mid'Oraisa. Eating Chalah mid'Rabanan is a Chazakah for Terumah mid'Oraisa.</p>
<p class="bas indent2"><span class="nm">1.</span>This is like Rav Huna brei d'Rav Yehoshua will say below.</p>
<p class="bas indent1"><span class="nm">(e)</span><span class="cl">Answer #3 (Beraisa):</span> Any of the following is a Chazakah (of Kehunah):</p>
<p class="bas indent2"><span class="nm">1.</span>In Eretz Yisrael, Birkas Kohanim or receiving Terumah at the granaries;</p>
<p class="bas indent2"><span class="nm">2.</span>In Surya or any place where Sheluchim arrive to inform which day was declared Rosh Chodesh, Birkas Kohanim is a Chazakah, but receiving Terumah is not.</p>
<p class="bas indent2"><span class="nm">3.</span>Bavel is considered like Surya.</p>
<p class="bas indent2"><span class="nm">4.</span>R. Shimon ben Gamliel says, even Alexandria used to be like Surya, since Beis Din was Kavu'a there.</p>
<p class="bas indent2"><span class="nm">5.</span><span class="cl">Suggestion:</span> Birkas Kohanim is a Chazakah for lineage.</p>
<p class="bas indent1"><span class="nm">(f)</span><span class="cl">Rejection:</span> No, it is for Chalah.</p>
<p class="bas indent1"><span class="nm">(g)</span><span class="cl">Question:</span> Presumably, it is a Chazakah like receiving Terumah, and there it must be for lineage!</p>
<p class="bas indent1"><span class="nm">(h)</span><span class="cl">Answer:</span> The Tana holds that Terumah is mid'Rabanan nowadays, but Chalah is mid'Oraisa. Eating Terumah mid'Rabanan is a Chazakah to eat Chalah mid'Oraisa;</p>
<p class="bas indent2"><span class="nm">1.</span><span class="cl">Rabanan:</span> Even the opinion that says that Terumah is mid'Rabanan nowadays agrees that Chalah is mid'Oraisa. We find that during the seven years of conquering Eretz Yisrael, and the seven years of dividing it among the tribes, there was an obligation to take Chalah, but not Terumah.</p>
<p class="bas indent1"><span class="nm">(i)</span><span class="cl">Rejection (Rav Huna brei d'Rav Yehoshua):</span> Just the opposite! Even the opinion that Terumah is mid'Oraisa today says that Chalah is only mid'Rabanan!</p>
<p class="bas indent2"><span class="nm">1.</span><span class="cl">(Beraisa):</span> "When <i>you</i> (plural) will come to the land" - when all of you come, not when a minority comes.</p>
<p class="bas indent2"><span class="nm">2.</span>Only a minority of those exiled to Bavel returned with Ezra to Eretz Yisrael.</p>
<p class="bas bbbline">25b----------------------------------------25b</p>
<p class="bas indent1"><span class="nm">(j)</span><span class="cl">Answer #4 (Beraisa):</span> Any of the following is a Chazakah of Kehunah: Birkas Kohanim, receiving Terumah at the granaries, and testimony.</p>
<p class="bas indent2"><span class="nm">1.</span><span class="cl">Question:</span> Testimony is not a Chazakah!</p>
<p class="bas indent2"><span class="nm">2.</span><span class="cl">Suggestion:</span> The Beraisa teaches that Birkas Kohanim is like testimony, i.e. it establishes lineage!</p>
<p class="bas indent1"><span class="nm">(k)</span><span class="cl">Rejection:</span> No, it teaches that testimony that is based on a Chazakah is like a Chazakah (like we will now describe).</p>
<p class="bas subject"><span class="nm">3)</span>A <i>CHAZAKAH</i> BASED ON READING IN THE <i>TORAH</i></p>
<p class="bas indent1"><span class="nm">(a)</span><span class="cl">A man (to R. Ami):</span> I know that Ploni is a Kohen, because he read first in the Torah.</p>
<p class="bas indent1"><span class="nm">(b)</span><span class="cl">Question (R. Ami):</span> Perhaps he is not a Kohen, but he was the greatest person in the Shul!</p>
<p class="bas indent1"><span class="nm">(c)</span><span class="cl">Answer:</span> A Levi read after him.</p>
<p class="bas indent2"><span class="nm">1.</span>R. Ami established Ploni to be a Kohen based on this.</p>
<p class="bas indent1"><span class="nm">(d)</span><span class="cl">A man (to R. Yehoshua ben Levi):</span> I know that David is a Levi, because he read second in the Torah.</p>
<p class="bas indent1"><span class="nm">(e)</span><span class="cl">Question (R. Yehoshua ben Levi):</span> Perhaps he is not a Levi, but he is a great person!</p>
<p class="bas indent1"><span class="nm">(f)</span><span class="cl">Answer:</span> A Kohen read before him.</p>
<p class="bas indent2"><span class="nm">1.</span>R. Yehoshua ben Levi established David to be a Levi based on this.</p>
<p class="bas indent1"><span class="nm">(g)</span><span class="cl">A man (to Reish Lakish):</span> I know that Reuven is a Kohen, because he read first in the Torah.</p>
<p class="bas indent1"><span class="nm">(h)</span><span class="cl">Reish Lakish:</span> Did you see him receive Terumah at the granaries?</p>
<p class="bas indent1"><span class="nm">(i)</span><span class="cl">R. Elazar:</span> Do you hold that if there are no granaries, we cannot establish anyone to be a Kohen?! (Certainly, it suffices that he read first in the Torah!)</p>
<p class="bas indent1"><span class="nm">(j)</span>A similar episode occurred when they were in front of R. Yochanan.</p>
<p class="bas indent1"><span class="nm">(k)</span><span class="cl">Reish Lakish:</span> Did you see him receive Terumah at the granaries?</p>
<p class="bas indent1"><span class="nm">(l)</span><span class="cl">R. Yochanan:</span> If there are no granaries, can no one be established to be a Kohen?!</p>
<p class="bas indent1"><span class="nm">(m)</span><span class="cl">Reish Lakish (angrily, to R. Elazar):</span> You heard these words from R. Yochanan, and did not say them in his name?!</p>
<p class="bas subject"><span class="nm">4)</span>ESTABLISHING A PERSON THROUGH RELATIVES</p>
<p class="bas indent1"><span class="nm">(a)</span>Rebbi or R. Chiya established Shimon to be a Kohen from Shimon's father's testimony. The other (of Rebbi and R. Chiya) established Yakov to be a Levi from Yakov's brother's testimony.</p>
<p class="bas indent1"><span class="nm">(b)</span>We must say that t Rebbi established Shimon to be a Kohen from his father's testimony:</p>
<p class="bas indent2"><span class="nm">1.</span><span class="cl">(Beraisa - Rebbi):</span> If one said 'This is my son. He is a Kohen', he is believed for Terumah, but not for lineage;</p>
<p class="bas indent2"><span class="nm">2.</span><span class="cl">R. Chiya:</span> If he is believed for Terumah, he should also be believed for lineage. If he is not believed for lineage, he should not be believed for Terumah!</p>
<p class="bas indent2"><span class="nm">3.</span><span class="cl">Rebbi:</span> I believe him for Terumah, since he can feed to his son Terumah. I do not believe him to let his son marry, since this is not in his control (perhaps the son is a Mamzer)!</p>
<p class="bas indent1"><span class="nm">(c)</span>Since Rebbi established a man to be a Kohen based on his father's testimony, it must be that R. Chiya established a man to be a Levi from his brother's testimony.</p>
<p class="bas indent1"><span class="nm">(d)</span><span class="cl">Question:</span> What is the difference? Just like one cannot testify about his son, the same should apply to his brother!</p>
