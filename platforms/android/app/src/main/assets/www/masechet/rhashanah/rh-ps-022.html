<p class="bas subject"><span class="nm">1)</span>THE DETAINING OF THE WITNESSES</p>
<p class="bas indent1"><span class="nm">(a)</span>It wasn't R. Akiva that detained the witnesses, but rather Shazfar, magistrate of Gader.</p>
<p class="bas indent1"><span class="nm">(b)</span>R. Gamliel responded by removing him from his position.</p>
<p class="bas subject"><span class="nm">2)</span><i>MISHNAH:</i> COMBINATIONS OF WITNESSES</p>
<p class="bas indent1"><span class="nm">(a)</span>A father and son who saw the moon should both go to Beis Din.</p>
<p class="bas indent2"><span class="nm">1.</span>Even though they can't testify together, if one is invalidated, the other can join another person's testimony.</p>
<p class="bas indent1"><span class="nm">(b)</span><span class="cl">(R. Shimon):</span> All relatives can combine for testimony about the moon.</p>
<p class="bas indent1"><span class="nm">(c)</span><span class="cl">(R. Yosi):</span> Tuvia, his son and his freed servant went to testify about the moon;</p>
<p class="bas indent2"><span class="nm">1.</span>The Kohanim accepted him and his son;</p>
<p class="bas indent2"><span class="nm">2.</span>Beis Din accepted him and his servant.</p>
<p class="bas subject"><span class="nm">3)</span>THE REASONS AND THE <i>HALACHAH</i></p>
<p class="bas indent1"><span class="nm">(a)</span>R. Shimon's reason is that Hash-m gave over the mitzvah of sanctifying Rosh Chodesh to Moshe and Aharon, who were brothers.</p>
<p class="bas indent1"><span class="nm">(b)</span>The others explain it just to mean that the responsibility of handling the testimony was given to the leaders of the generation.</p>
<p class="bas indent1"><span class="nm">(c)</span><span class="cl">(R. Chanan bar Rava):</span> The Halachah follows R. Shimon.</p>
<p class="bas indent1"><span class="nm">(d)</span><span class="cl">(R. Huna):</span> How can you go against the cited story in the Mishnah?</p>
<p class="bas indent1"><span class="nm">(e)</span><span class="cl">(R. Chanan bar Rava):</span> I said this many times to Rav and he didn't object!</p>
<p class="bas indent1"><span class="nm">(f)</span><span class="cl">(R. Huna):</span> This was because you learned the opposite positions; that R. Shimon disqualifies certain combinations.</p>
<p class="bas indent1"><span class="nm">(g)</span><span class="cl">(Citing Shmuel):</span> The Halachah follows R. Shimon.</p>
<p class="bas subject"><span class="nm">4)</span><i>MISHNAH:</i> INVALID WITNESSES</p>
<p class="bas indent1"><span class="nm">(a)</span>The following people are disqualified from giving testimony:</p>
<p class="bas indent2"><span class="nm">1.</span>Gamblers,</p>
<p class="bas indent2"><span class="nm">2.</span>Those who lend on interest,</p>
<p class="bas indent2"><span class="nm">3.</span>Pigeon racers,</p>
<p class="bas indent2"><span class="nm">4.</span>Those who trade in Shemitah produce,</p>
<p class="bas indent2"><span class="nm">5.</span>Servants.</p>
<p class="bas indent1"><span class="nm">(b)</span>The rule is that any testimony for which a woman is invalid, these are also invalid.</p>
<p class="bas subject"><span class="nm">5)</span>IMPLICATIONS OF THE <i>MISHNAH</i></p>
<p class="bas indent1"><span class="nm">(a)</span>From the Mishnah we see that if women are valid for certain testimony, so are these people.</p>
<p class="bas indent2"><span class="nm">1.</span><span class="cl">(R. Ashi):</span> Thus, a thief according to Rabbinical law is valid to give testimony that a woman could give.</p>

<p class="bas subject"><span class="nm">6)</span><i>MISHNAH:</i> SPECIAL ARRANGEMENTS FOR WITNESSES</p>
<p class="bas indent1"><span class="nm">(a)</span>If a witness is unable to walk, we put him on a donkey (even on Shabbos) or stretcher.</p>
<p class="bas indent1"><span class="nm">(b)</span>His attendants can take sticks for self-defense.</p>
<p class="bas indent1"><span class="nm">(c)</span>They can also take provisions if the journey will be long (a day's journey may be taken and Shabbos transgressed).</p>
<p class="bas subject"><span class="nm">7)</span><i>MISHNAH:</i> ACCEPTABLE WITNESSES</p>
<p class="bas indent1"><span class="nm">(a)</span>If Beis Din don't know a witness, a character witness is sent with him.</p>
<p class="bas indent1"><span class="nm">(b)</span>Originally, all people were accepted as witnesses;</p>
<p class="bas indent1"><span class="nm">(c)</span>After the Baytusim sabotaged the process, it was decreed that only recognized people would be accepted.</p>
<p class="bas bbbline">22b----------------------------------------22b</p>
<p class="bas subject"><span class="nm">8)</span>CHARACTER WITNESSES</p>
<p class="bas indent1"><span class="nm">(a)</span><span class="cl">Question:</span> How many people would be required as character witnesses?</p>
<p class="bas indent1"><span class="nm">(b)</span><span class="cl">Answer:</span> One</p>
<p class="bas indent1"><span class="nm">(c)</span><span class="cl">Question:</span> Surely one alone is not believed; we see in an anecdote that more came!?</p>
<p class="bas indent1"><span class="nm">(d)</span><span class="cl">Answer (R. Papa):</span> It means that one pair is required.</p>
<p class="bas indent2"><span class="nm">1.</span>This is also clear from the Mishnah referring to the witness not being recognized by Beis Din.</p>
<p class="bas indent2"><span class="nm">2.</span>It must be referring to a pair of witnesses, as two are required.</p>
<p class="bas indent2"><span class="nm">3.</span>So, too, the character witnesses being referred to are a pair.</p>
<p class="bas indent1"><span class="nm">(e)</span><span class="cl">Question:</span> Surely only one character witness is required, as we find that R. Nehorai accomplished it!</p>
<p class="bas indent1"><span class="nm">(f)</span><span class="cl">Answer:</span> R. Nehorai was accompanied by another witness, who was not mentioned out of respect for R. Nehorai.</p>
<p class="bas indent1"><span class="nm">(g)</span><span class="cl">Alternate answer (R. Ashi):</span> R. Nehorai was going to join up with another witness.</p>
<p class="bas indent2"><span class="nm">1.</span><span class="cl">Question:</span> If so, what is the Chidush?</p>
<p class="bas indent2"><span class="nm">2.</span><span class="cl">Answer:</span> We might have thought that because of the risk that he may not be able to find him, he may not break Shabbos.</p>
<p class="bas indent1"><span class="nm">(h)</span>Ulla attested that Rosh Chodesh had been declared in Eretz Yisrael.</p>
<p class="bas indent2"><span class="nm">1.</span><span class="cl">(R. Kahana):</span> Even a lesser person than Ulla would be believed.</p>
<p class="bas indent2"><span class="nm">2.</span>The reason is that people wouldn't lie about something that is due to be discovered by everyone.</p>
<p class="bas indent2"><span class="nm">3.</span>A Beraisa likewise states that even a witness from the other side of the world is believed to attest that Beis Din sanctified Rosh Chodesh.</p>
<p class="bas subject"><span class="nm">9)</span>THE BAYTUSIM</p>
<p class="bas indent1"><span class="nm">(a)</span>The Baytusim (who wanted the Omer to begin on Sunday) once hired false witnesses to deceive Beis Din about the moon.</p>
<p class="bas indent1"><span class="nm">(b)</span>One of them was on our side, and told Beis Din (by way of metaphor) that he had been hired to trick them.</p>
<p class="bas indent1"><span class="nm">(c)</span>Beis Din awarded him the money that he had been paid and gave Malkus to the Baytusim.</p>
<p class="bas indent1"><span class="nm">(d)</span>From that time, it was decreed that only people recognized as non-Baytusim would be accepted for testimony.</p>
<p class="bas subject"><span class="nm">10)</span><i>MISHNAH:</i> THE FIRE SIGNALS</p>
<p class="bas indent1"><span class="nm">(a)</span>Originally, there was a relay of fires to transmit the message about Rosh Chodesh.</p>
<p class="bas indent2"><span class="nm">1.</span>When the Kusim sabotaged the process, they sent messengers instead.</p>
<p class="bas indent1"><span class="nm">(b)</span>The fire signals were made from wood and flax, and were waved from atop a mountain until the person on the next mountain did the same.</p>
<p class="bas indent1"><span class="nm">(c)</span>The message was thereby relayed from Har ha'Mishchah to Beis Baltin, where the Diaspora could see it lit up like a bonfire.</p>
<p class="bas subject"><span class="nm">11)</span>WHEN THE FIRE SIGNALS WERE DONE</p>
<p class="bas indent1"><span class="nm">(a)</span>We see from a Pasuk that the Masu'os spoken of in the Mishnah are fires.</p>
<p class="bas indent1"><span class="nm">(b)</span><span class="cl">(Beraisa):</span> The fire signals were done only for new moons that appeared on time, and they were done on the eve of the 30th day.</p>
<p class="bas indent1"><span class="nm">(c)</span><span class="cl">Question:</span> Why were they only done for abridged months?</p>
<p class="bas indent1"><span class="nm">(d)</span><span class="cl">Answer (R. Zeira):</span> As a Gezerah in case of the end of an abridged month which fell on a Friday, when the fire can only be lit on Motzai Shabbos:</p>
<p class="bas indent2"><span class="nm">1.</span>If fires are lit for both types of month, people won't know if a fire on Motzai Shabbos is being lit on time for a full month or if it was an abridged month and it was delayed because of Shabbos.</p>
<p class="bas indent2"><span class="nm">2.</span><span class="cl">Question:</span> Let fires be lit for both months, and when Rosh Chodesh is on Friday, let no fire be lit (and people will work out that it must be an abridged month)!?</p>
<p class="bas indent2"><span class="nm">3.</span><span class="cl">Answer:</span> People will consider that it might be a full month and something prevented them from lighting a fire.</p>
<p class="bas indent1"><span class="nm">(e)</span><span class="cl">Question:</span> Let fires be lit only for full months?</p>
<p class="bas indent1"><span class="nm">(f)</span><span class="cl">Answer (Abaye):</span> It would result in two days' loss of work, as people don't know when Rosh Chodesh is until the second day.</p>
