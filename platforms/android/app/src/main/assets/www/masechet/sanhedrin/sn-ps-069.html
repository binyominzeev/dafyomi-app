<p class="bas subject"><span class="nm">1)</span>THE AGE OF BEN SORER U'MOREH</p>
<p class="bas indent1"><span class="nm">(a)</span><span class="cl">Question (Abaye - Beraisa):</span> Perhaps "Ish (who will have Bi'ah with a Shifchah Charufah (a semi-married slave) in a way proper to eject semen)" applies only to an adult;</p>
<p class="bas indent2"><span class="nm">1.</span><span class="cl">Question:</span> What is the source to include a nine year- old boy, who can have Bi'ah?</p>
<p class="bas indent2"><span class="nm">2.</span><span class="cl">Answer:</span> We learn from "<i>v</i>'Ish."</p>
<p class="bas indent1"><span class="nm">(b)</span><span class="cl">Answer (Rabah):</span> A nine year-old can have Bi'ah (with semen), but it will not lead to a child, just like grain less than a third grown (it has seeds, but they will not sprout).</p>
<p class="bas indent1"><span class="nm">(c)</span><span class="cl">(D'Vei Chizkiyah):</span> "V'Chi <i>Yazid</i> Ish" - an Ish 'cooks' his seed (enabling it to produce a child) before ejecting it, but a minor does not.</p>
<p class="bas indent1"><span class="nm">(d)</span><span class="cl">Question (Rav Mordechai):</span> What is the source that 'Mezid' connotes cooking?</p>
<p class="bas indent1"><span class="nm">(e)</span><span class="cl">Answer (Rav Ashi):</span> "Va'Yazed Yakov Nazid."</p>
<p class="bas indent1"><span class="nm">(f)</span><span class="cl">Question (Beraisa - Tana d'Vei R. Yishmael):</span> "Ben" excludeds a father.</p>
<p class="bas indent2"><span class="nm">1.</span><span class="cl">Question:</span> What is the case (that the Torah must exclude a father from becoming a Ben Sorer u'Moreh)?</p>
<p class="bas indent3"><span class="nm">i.</span><span class="cl">Suggestion:</span> He impregnated his wife (or any woman) after he became an adult, and she gave birth before his (lower) beard filled out.</p>
<p class="bas indent3"><span class="nm">ii.</span><span class="cl">Rejection:</span> R. Kruspedai taught that a boy can become a Ben Sorer u'Moreh during only three months (at the beginning of his adulthood. Pregnancy always exceeds six months!)</p>
<p class="bas indent2"><span class="nm">2.</span><span class="cl">Answer:</span> We must say 'he impregnated her (more than three months) before he was an adult, and she gave birth before his beard filled out.</p>
<p class="bas indent2"><span class="nm">3.</span><span class="cl">Inference:</span> This shows that a minor can father children!</p>
<p class="bas indent1"><span class="nm">(g)</span><span class="cl">Answer (and Answer #2 to Question (1)):</span> Really, he impregnated her after he became an adult, and she gave birth after his beard filled out.</p>
<p class="bas indent1"><span class="nm">(h)</span><span class="cl">Question:</span> The birth must be more than six months into his adulthood. Ben Sorer u'Moreh applies only during the first three months!</p>
<p class="bas indent1"><span class="nm">(i)</span><span class="cl">Answer (Rav Dimi):</span> Tana d'Vei R. Yishmael teaches that he cannot become a Ben Sorer u'Moreh once he <i>can properly be called</i> a father (i.e. his wife could be visibly pregnant, i.e. three months after he became an adult).</p>
<p class="bas indent1"><span class="nm">(j)</span><span class="cl">(R. Kruspedai):</span> A boy can become a Ben Sorer u'Moreh during only three months.</p>
<p class="bas indent1"><span class="nm">(k)</span><span class="cl">Question (Mishnah):</span> A boy can become a Ben Sorer u'Moreh from the time he brings two hairs until his beard fills out.</p>
<p class="bas indent1"><span class="nm">(l)</span><span class="cl">Answer:</span> He cannot become a Ben Sorer u'Moreh once his beard fills out <i>or</i> after three months into his adulthood.</p>
<p class="bas subject"><span class="nm">2)</span>FOLLOWING THE MAJORITY</p>
<p class="bas indent1"><span class="nm">(a)</span><span class="cl">(R. Yakov of Nehar Pekod citing Rav Huna brei d'Rav Yehoshua):</span> We learn from R. Kruspedai that if a woman will give birth after seven months, she will not be recognizably pregnant (like most women are) after a third of the pregnancy.</p>
<p class="bas indent2"><span class="nm">1.</span>If she would be, a boy would be too old to be a Ben Sorer u'Moreh two and a third months after becoming an adult (for he could be called a father)!</p>
<p class="bas indent1"><span class="nm">(b)</span><span class="cl">Rejection (Ravina):</span> Perhaps she is recognizably pregnant after a third, but the law of Ben Sorer u'Moreh is based on the majority (most babies are born after nine months).</p>
<p class="bas indent1"><span class="nm">(c)</span><span class="cl">(Rav Huna brei d'Rav Yehoshua (after he heard this)):</span> We do not follow the majority in capital cases - "v'Shoftu ha'Edah v'Hitzilu ha'Edah." If we can find a reason to exempt (e.g. he could be called a father), we do!</p>
<p class="bas indent1"><span class="nm">(d)</span><span class="cl">Rejection #1 (Ravina):</span> We do follow the majority!</p>
<p class="bas indent2"><span class="nm">1.</span><span class="cl">(Mishnah):</span> If one witness says 'it was the second of the month', and the other says 'it was the third', their testimony stands. We assume that the first heard that the month was Me'ubar, and the latter did not (therefore, he thought that it was the third).</p>
<p class="bas indent3"><span class="nm">i.</span>If we would not follow the majority (most people sometimes err about which day was Rosh Chodesh), we would say that neither errs, rather, they refer to different days, and the testimony is invalid!</p>
<p class="bas indent1"><span class="nm">(e)</span><span class="cl">Rejection #2 (R. Yirmeyah mi'Difti - Mishnah):</span> The following apply to a girl above three years:</p>
<p class="bas indent2"><span class="nm">1.</span>She can become Mekudeshes through Bi'ah. If she fell to Yibum and did Yibum, it takes effect;</p>
<p class="bas indent2"><span class="nm">2.</span>If she is married, one is liable for her due to Eshes Ish. One who has Bi'ah with her (when she is Nidah) becomes Tamei, and he is Metamei a mattress under him like a Keli above (a Zav and touching him);</p>
<p class="bas indent2"><span class="nm">3.</span>If she has Nisu'in with a Kohen, she may eat Terumah. If a Pasul had Bi'ah with her, she is disqualified from Kehunah;</p>
<p class="bas indent2"><span class="nm">4.</span>If any of the Arayos had Bi'ah with her, he is killed, and she is exempt.</p>
<p class="bas bbbline">69b----------------------------------------69b</p>
<p class="bas indent2"><span class="nm">5.</span><span class="cl">Question:</span> Why can we kill? We should be concerned lest she is an Ailonis (a girl who will not develop like a normal female). Her husband never intended to be Mekadesh an Ailonis, so her Kidushin is invalid!</p>
<p class="bas indent2"><span class="nm">6.</span><span class="cl">Answer:</span> We must say that we follow the majority. Most women are not Ailoniyos!</p>
<p class="bas indent1"><span class="nm">(f)</span><span class="cl">Rejection (of this rejection):</span> No. One who has Bi'ah with her is liable to bring a Korban due to Eshes Ish (if he was Shogeg, but we would not rely on the majority to kill him).</p>
<p class="bas indent2"><span class="nm">1.</span><span class="cl">Question:</span> It says that men are killed for (Bi'ah with) her!</p>
<p class="bas indent2"><span class="nm">2.</span><span class="cl">Answer #1:</span> This refers to her father (he is liable even if she is single).</p>
<p class="bas indent2"><span class="nm">3.</span><span class="cl">Question:</span> It says that any of the Arayos are killed due to her!</p>
<p class="bas indent2"><span class="nm">4.</span><span class="cl">Answer #2:</span> The case is, her husband agreed to be Mekadesh her even if she is an Ailonis.</p>
<p class="bas indent1"><span class="nm">(g)</span><span class="cl">(Beraisa - Beis Shamai):</span> If a woman was sporting with her son and he did Ha'ara'ah, she is disqualified from Kehunah;</p>
<p class="bas indent1"><span class="nm">(h)</span>Beis Hillel permit her.</p>
<p class="bas indent1"><span class="nm">(i)</span><span class="cl">(Rav Chisda):</span> All agree that Bi'ah of a nine year-old boy is considered Bi'ah. If he is less than eight, it is not considered Bi'ah;</p>
<p class="bas indent2"><span class="nm">1.</span>They argue about a boy between eight and nine. Beis Shamai learn from previous generations (an eight year-old could father a child), and Beis Hillel do not.</p>
<p class="bas indent1"><span class="nm">(j)</span><span class="cl">Question:</span> What is the source that an eight year-old could father a child?</p>
<p class="bas indent1"><span class="nm">(k)</span><span class="cl">Answer #1:</span> We learn from the ancestry of Shlomo.</p>
<p class="bas indent2"><span class="nm">1.</span>Shlomo was seven years old when Achitofel (his great grandfather) died;</p>
<p class="bas indent2"><span class="nm">2.</span><span class="cl">(Beraisa):</span> "Anshei Damim u'Mirmah Lo Yechetzu Yemeihem" (they will not live even 35 years, half a normal lifetime) - Do'eg lived 34 years, and Achitofel lived 33.</p>
<p class="bas indent2"><span class="nm">3.</span>Shlomo was born when Achitofel was 26. If we assume that each of the three generations was eight and two-thirds years apart, and allow about eight months for each pregnancy, each generation fathered the next at (about) the age of eight!</p>
<p class="bas indent1"><span class="nm">(l)</span><span class="cl">Rejection:</span> Perhaps the generations were not evenly spaced, rather, Bas Sheva was six when she became pregnant with Shlomo, her grandfather and father were each nine when they fathered (her father and Bas Sheva);</p>
<p class="bas indent2"><span class="nm">1.</span>Women are healthier than men, so they can have children earlier.</p>
<p class="bas indent2"><span class="nm">2.</span><span class="cl">Support:</span> Bas Sheva had a child (i.e. the one that died) even before Shlomo. (I do not understand this support. Perhaps the generations from Achitofel until Bas Sheva's <i>first</i> son (25 years later) were evenly spaced, i.e. each was eight and a third years older than his or her child!)</p>
<p class="bas indent1"><span class="nm">(m)</span><span class="cl">Answer #1:</span> We learn from the birth of Sarah.</p>
<p class="bas indent2"><span class="nm">1.</span>"Terach Holid Es Avraham Es Nachor v'Es Haran" - allowing a year between each, Avraham was two years older than Haran;</p>
<p class="bas indent2"><span class="nm">2.</span><span class="cl">(R. Yitzchak):</span> Yiskah (the daughter of Haran) is Sarah. She is called Yiskah because she was Socheh (saw) with Ru'ach ha'Kodesh - "Kol Asher Tomar Elecha Sarah Shma b'Kolah."</p>
<p class="bas indent3"><span class="nm">i.</span>Also, she is called Yiskah because everyone used to look at her beauty.</p>
<p class="bas indent2"><span class="nm">3.</span>"...Hal'Ven Me'ah...Sarah ha'Vas Tish'im" - Avraham was 10 years older than Sarah, and he was two years older than her father, i.e. Haran was eight when she was born!</p>
<p class="bas indent1"><span class="nm">(n)</span><span class="cl">Rejection:</span> Perhaps Avraham was younger than Haran, and the Torah lists them in order of Chachmah.</p>
<p class="bas indent1"><span class="nm">(o)</span><span class="cl">Support:</span> The Torah lists Noach's children in order of their Chachmah!</p>
<p class="bas indent2"><span class="nm">1.</span>"Noach was 500 years old; he fathered Shem, Cham and Yafes";</p>
<p class="bas indent2"><span class="nm">2.</span>The flood came 100 years later (Noach was 600), and "Shem Ben Me'as Shanah...Shenasayim Achar ha'Mabul."</p>
<p class="bas indent2"><span class="nm">3.</span>If Shem were the firstborn, he should have been 102!</p>
<p class="bas indent2"><span class="nm">4.</span>Rather, we must say that the Torah lists them in order of Chachmah.</p>
<p class="bas indent1"><span class="nm">(p)</span><span class="cl">Answer #3:</span> We learn from the ancestry of Betzalel:</p>
<p class="bas indent2"><span class="nm">1.</span>Betzalel was (at least) 13 when he made the Mishkan for it says "<i>Ish</i> Ish mi'Melachto";</p>
<p class="bas indent2"><span class="nm">2.</span>The Mishkan was made in the first year (of leaving Miztrayim). In the second year it was erected and the Meraglim were sent;</p>
<p class="bas indent2"><span class="nm">3.</span>Kalev, the father of the father of Betzalel's father, was 40 when he went with the Meraglim, i.e. he was 26 when Betzalel was born.</p>
<p class="bas indent2"><span class="nm">4.</span>The generations were (on the average) eight and two- thirds years apart. Allowing eight months for each pregnancy, each generation fathered the next at (an aaverage of) eight years! (Even if they were not evenly spaced, at least one of them fathered a son when he was at most eight.)</p>
<p class="bas subject"><span class="nm">3)</span>THE HALACHAH APPLIES ONLY TO BOYS</p>
<p class="bas indent1"><span class="nm">(a)</span><span class="cl">(Mishnah):</span> A son, and not a daughter.</p>
<p class="bas indent1"><span class="nm">(b)</span><span class="cl">(Beraisa - R. Shimon):</span> The Parshah of Ben Sorer u'Moreh should apply also to a girl. If she gets addicted to meat and wine, she will become a harlot to support her habit;</p>
<p class="bas indent2"><span class="nm">1.</span>The Torah decreed that it applies only to boys.</p>
