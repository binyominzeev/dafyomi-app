<p class="dedicationbox">SHEVUOS 46 - Two weeks of study material have been dedicated by Mrs. Estanne Abraham Fawer to honor the Yahrzeit of her father, Rav Mordechai ben Eliezer Zvi (Rabbi Morton Weiner) Z'L, who passed away on 18 Teves 5760. May the merit of supporting and advancing Dafyomi study -- which was so important to him -- during the weeks of his Yahrzeit serve as an Iluy for his Neshamah. </p>

<p class="bas subject"><span class="nm">1)</span>A DISPUTE OVER THE WAGE</p>
<p class="bas indent1"><span class="nm">(a)</span><span class="cl">Question (Bei Rav):</span> If a worker claims that he was hired for two (Zuz), and the employer says that he hired him for one, who swears?</p>
<p class="bas indent1"><span class="nm">(b)</span><span class="cl">Answer (Shmuel):</span> In this case, the employer swears and the worker loses, for people remember the wage. (There is no more reason to say that the employer forgot. Therefore, the worker does not collect without proof.)</p>
<p class="bas indent1"><span class="nm">(c)</span><span class="cl">Question (Beraisa #1):</span> (If a worker claims that he was hired for two Zuz, and the employer says that he hired him for one, for the worker) to take money (from the employer), he must bring proof.</p>
<p class="bas indent2"><span class="nm">1.</span><span class="cl">Inference:</span> If he cannot bring proof, he has no claim.</p>
<p class="bas indent2"><span class="nm">2.</span>According to Shmuel, the employer should have to swear (to avoid paying two)!</p>
<p class="bas indent1"><span class="nm">(d)</span><span class="cl">Answer (Rav Nachman):</span> No, the Beraisa means as follows:</p>
<p class="bas indent2"><span class="nm">1.</span>If the worker can bring proof, he collects;</p>
<p class="bas indent2"><span class="nm">2.</span>If he cannot bring proof, the employer must swear, and then the worker loses.</p>
<p class="bas indent1"><span class="nm">(e)</span><span class="cl">Question (Beraisa #2):</span> If Reuven gave his garment to a craftsman (Shimon) to be fixed, and they argue about whether he was hired for one or two, if Shimon still has the garment, Reuven must bring a proof or pay two. If he returned the garment to Reuven, if it is within the time to claim his wage, Shimon swears and collects. If the time has passed, Shimon must bring proof to collect two from Reuven.</p>
<p class="bas indent2"><span class="nm">1.</span><span class="cl">Summation of question:</span> In the middle clause, why does Shimon swear and collect? According to Shmuel, Reuven should swear and be exempt!</p>
<p class="bas indent1"><span class="nm">(f)</span><span class="cl">Answer (Rav Nachman bar Yitzchak):</span> Beraisa #2 is like R. Yehudah, who says that whenever the Torah obligated the employer to swear (e.g. here, for Reuven agrees that he owes one), Chachamim enacted that the worker swears and collects.</p>
<p class="bas indent1"><span class="nm">(g)</span><span class="cl">Question:</span> Where do we find that R. Yehudah says this?</p>
<p class="bas indent2"><span class="nm">1.</span><span class="cl">Suggestion:</span> He says so in our Mishnah.</p>
<p class="bas indent2"><span class="nm">2.</span><span class="cl">Rejection:</span> There, R. Yehudah allows the worker to collect less freely than Chachamim!</p>
<p class="bas indent3"><span class="nm">i.</span><span class="cl">(Mishnah - R. Yehudah):</span> The worker may swear and collect only when the employer partially admitted to the claim.</p>
<p class="bas indent1"><span class="nm">(h)</span><span class="cl">Answer:</span> He says so in the following Beraisa.</p>
<p class="bas indent2"><span class="nm">1.</span><span class="cl">(Beraisa):</span> A worker can swear and collect within the time to claim his wage, but not after the time has passed;</p>
<p class="bas indent2"><span class="nm">2.</span>R. Yehudah says, that is only when the employer admits that he owes part of the wages (and the worker says that he owes all), or when he says that he hired him for one (and the worker says that he was hired for two);</p>
<p class="bas indent3"><span class="nm">i.</span>However, if the employer says that he never hired him, or he paid all his wages, the worker must bring proof in order to collect.</p>
<p class="bas indent1"><span class="nm">(i)</span><span class="cl">Question (Rav Shisha brei d'Rav Idi):</span> It is illogical to say that Beraisa #2 is R. Yehudah, and Chachamim argue with it!</p>
<p class="bas indent2"><span class="nm">1.</span>R. Yehudah is stringent (he allows the worker to collect only when the employer partially admits), and Chachamim are more lenient about the worker;</p>
<p class="bas indent2"><span class="nm">2.</span>Will we say that where R. Yehudah is lenient (to allow a craftsman to swear (in the proper time) and collect after returning the garment), Chachamim are stringent?!</p>
<p class="bas indent2"><span class="nm">3.</span><span class="cl">Counter-question:</span> If Beraisa #2 is Chachamim, who is the Tana of Beraisa #1?</p>
<p class="bas indent3"><span class="nm">i.</span>It is not Chachamim, nor R. Yehudah (for both agree that when they argue about the wage, the worker swears and collects)!</p>
<p class="bas indent1"><span class="nm">(j)</span><span class="cl">Answer (Rava):</span> It <i>is</i> logical to say that Beraisa #2 is R. Yehudah, and Chachamim argue!</p>
<p class="bas indent2"><span class="nm">1.</span>R. Yehudah says that when the Torah obligates the employer to swear, Chachamim enacted that the worker swears and collects;</p>
<p class="bas indent3"><span class="nm">i.</span>If the employer need not swear mid'Oraisa, only mid'Rabanan, Chachamim did not make a second enactment for the worker.</p>
<p class="bas indent2"><span class="nm">2.</span>Chachamim say that even when the employer's oath is only mid'Rabanan, Chachamim enacted that the worker swears and collects (if he says that he was not paid);</p>
<p class="bas indent3"><span class="nm">i.</span>They hold that everyone remembers the wage, so when they argue about the wage, the worker does not swear and collect.</p>
<p class="bas subject"><span class="nm">2)</span>THE ENACTMENT OF AN OATH FOR A NIGZAL</p>
<p class="bas indent1"><span class="nm">(a)</span><span class="cl">(Mishnah):</span> The case of a Nigzal - witnesses testify that Levi entered Yehudah's house to take a security...</p>
<p class="bas indent1"><span class="nm">(b)</span><span class="cl">Objection:</span> Why does Yehudah swear and collect? Perhaps Levi did not take anything!</p>
<p class="bas indent2"><span class="nm">1.</span><span class="cl">(Rav Nachman):</span> If Reuven took an axe and said 'I will cut Shimon's date tree', and we later see it cut and lying on the ground, we do not say that Reuven (surely) cut it and he must pay;</p>
<p class="bas indent2"><span class="nm">2.</span>This is because people often make empty, exaggerated threats.</p>
<p class="bas indent2"><span class="nm">3.</span>Here also, perhaps Levi never took a security!</p>
<p class="bas indent1"><span class="nm">(c)</span><span class="cl">Answer:</span> The Mishnah means that witnesses testify that Levi took a security.</p>
<p class="bas indent1"><span class="nm">(d)</span><span class="cl">Question:</span> We should ask the witnesses what he took! (Why must Yehudah swear?)</p>
<p class="bas indent1"><span class="nm">(e)</span><span class="cl">Answer (Rabah bar bar Chanah):</span> The case is, Yehudah claims that Levi took vessels that can be hidden under one's garment.</p>
<p class="bas indent1"><span class="nm">(f)</span><span class="cl">(Rav Yehudah):</span> If witnesses saw Reuven leave Shimon's house with vessels hidden under his garment, and Reuven claims that he bought them, he is not believed.</p>
<p class="bas bbbline">46b----------------------------------------46b</p>
<p class="bas indent2"><span class="nm">1.</span>This is only if Shimon does not normally sell his vessels, <i>and</i> Reuven took vessels that people do not normally hide, <i>and</i> Reuven does not normally hide (even such) vessels;</p>
<p class="bas indent3"><span class="nm">i.</span>If any of these is not true, Reuven is believed.</p>
<p class="bas indent2"><span class="nm">2.</span>This is only if Shimon claims that he lent to him the vessels, but we do not believe him if he claims that Reuven stole them. (Ritva - in the Mishnah, he is believed to say that Reuven stole them! That is when witnesses saw Reuven enter his house without permission to take a security.)</p>
<p class="bas indent2"><span class="nm">3.</span><span class="cl">Version #1 (Rashi):</span> We believe Shimon only about vessels that are normally lent or rented. Regarding other vessels, Reuven is always believed.</p>
<p class="bas indent2"><span class="nm">4.</span><span class="cl">Version #2 (Tosfos):</span> When we said that Reuven is believed (e.g. if Shimon normally sells his vessels, or about vessels that people normally hide, or if Reuven normally hides vessels, or if Shimon claims that Reuven stole them), this applies only to vessels that are not normally lent or rented;</p>
<p class="bas indent3"><span class="nm">i.</span>Shimon is always believed about vessels that are normally lent or rented. (end of Version #2)</p>
<p class="bas indent2"><span class="nm">5.</span><span class="cl">Support:</span> Rav Huna bar Avin taught that if Levi is holding vessels that are normally lent or rented, and they used to belong to Yehudah, he is not believed to say that he bought them.</p>
<p class="bas indent2"><span class="nm">6.</span>Rava allowed a man to collect a scissors (used by people who comb garments) and a Sefer of Agadah from orphans, because these were known to belong to him. (We assume that he lent them to their father.)</p>
<p class="bas indent1"><span class="nm">(g)</span><span class="cl">(Rava):</span> (The Mishnah teaches that if witnesses testify that Levi entered Yehudah's house to take a security, Yehudah swears about what was taken, and he collects.) Even one who guards Yehudah's house, or the guards's wife may swear.</p>
<p class="bas indent1"><span class="nm">(h)</span><span class="cl">Question (Rav Papa):</span> If one works for and boards with Yehudah, may he swear?</p>
<p class="bas indent2"><span class="nm">1.</span>This question is not resolved.</p>
<p class="bas indent1"><span class="nm">(i)</span><span class="cl">Question (Rav Yemar):</span> If Yehudah claims that Levi took a silver cup, what is the law?</p>
<p class="bas indent1"><span class="nm">(j)</span><span class="cl">Answer (Rav Ashi):</span> If we estimate that Yehudah is wealthy enough to own such a cup, or if he is so trustworthy that people would deposit it by him, he is believed. If not, he is not believed.</p>
<p class="bas subject"><span class="nm">3)</span>THE OATH OF A NECHBAL</p>
<p class="bas indent1"><span class="nm">(a)</span><span class="cl">(Mishnah):</span> The case of a Nechbal... (Levi swears that Yehudah wounded him, and collects).</p>
<p class="bas indent1"><span class="nm">(b)</span><span class="cl">(Rav Yehudah):</span> Levi swears only about a wound that he could have inflicted on himself. For a wound he could not do to himself (e.g. on his back), he collects without swearing.</p>
<p class="bas indent1"><span class="nm">(c)</span><span class="cl">Question:</span> Perhaps he scratched himself against a wall!</p>
<p class="bas indent1"><span class="nm">(d)</span><span class="cl">Answer (R. Chiya):</span> The case is, he was bitten on his back.</p>
<p class="bas indent1"><span class="nm">(e)</span><span class="cl">Question:</span> Perhaps someone else bit him!</p>
<p class="bas indent1"><span class="nm">(f)</span><span class="cl">Answer:</span> The case is, Levi was secluded with Yehudah. No one else was there.</p>
<p class="bas subject"><span class="nm">4)</span>ONE WHO IS DISQUALIFIED FROM SWEARING</p>
<p class="bas indent1"><span class="nm">(a)</span><span class="cl">(Mishnah):</span> If the defendant is suspected of swearing falsely, even a vain oath.</p>
<p class="bas indent1"><span class="nm">(b)</span><span class="cl">Question:</span> Why does it say <i>even</i> a vain oath?</p>
<p class="bas indent1"><span class="nm">(c)</span>The Mishnah teaches a bigger Chidush;</p>
<p class="bas indent2"><span class="nm">1.</span>Not only (if he swore falsely) an oath which denies money, but even a vain oath disqualifies him from swearing.</p>
<p class="bas indent1"><span class="nm">(d)</span><span class="cl">Question:</span> The Mishnah should say that he is disqualified also for a false Shevu'as Bituy!</p>
<p class="bas indent1"><span class="nm">(e)</span><span class="cl">Answer:</span> The Mishnah lists only oaths that are false the moment they are said. One who swore a false oath of Bituy never intended to swear falsely (even if later he did not fulfill his oath. Rashi - he is not suspected to swear falsely. Tosfos - he is suspected, but the Tana did not teach such cases).</p>
<p class="bas indent1"><span class="nm">(f)</span><span class="cl">Question:</span> Indeed, a (future) oath of Bituy such as 'I will (or will not) eat' is not false the moment it is said;</p>
<p class="bas indent2"><span class="nm">1.</span>However, a oath of Bituy (in the past) such as 'I ate (or did not eat)' is false the moment it is said! (Why does the Mishnah omit it?)</p>
<p class="bas indent1"><span class="nm">(g)</span><span class="cl">Answer:</span> The Tana taught vain oaths. This includes false oaths of Bituy in the past.</p>
