<p class="dedicationbox">KESUVOS 47 - Two weeks of study material have been dedicated by Mrs. Estanne Abraham Fawer to honor the Yahrzeit of her father, Rav Mordechai ben Eliezer Zvi (Rabbi Morton Weiner) Z'L, who passed away on 18 Teves 5760. May the merit of supporting and advancing Dafyomi study -- which was so important to him -- during the weeks of his Yahrzeit serve as an Iluy for his Neshamah. </p>

<div class="subject"><span class="nm">1)</span><p>PRIVILEGES A FATHER HAS IN HIS DAUGHTER (cont.)</p></div>
<div class="indent1"><span class="nm">(a)</span><p><span class="cl">(Mishnah):</span> He receive her Metzi'os.</p></div>
<div class="indent1"><span class="nm">(b)</span><p>This is to avoid resentment (which could induce him to cease to feed her or be Mekadesh her to a disgusting person).</p></div>
<div class="indent1"><span class="nm">(c)</span><p><span class="cl">(Rav Huna):</span> We learn that a man receives his daughter's earnings from "When a man will sell his daughter to be a slave".</p></div>
<div class="indent2"><span class="nm">1.</span><p>Just like a slave's earnings belong to her master, a girl's earnings belong to her father.</p></div>
<div class="indent1"><span class="nm">(d)</span><p><span class="cl">Question:</span> This applies only to a minor, whom he can sell. He cannot sell a Na'arah. Perhaps she keeps her earnings!</p></div>
<div class="indent1"><span class="nm">(e)</span><p><span class="cl">Answer #1:</span> Surely, he must receive them. If not, how did the Torah authorize him to send her to Chupah, and interrupt her work!</p></div>
<div class="indent1"><span class="nm">(f)</span><p><span class="cl">Objection (Rav Achai):</span> Perhaps he compensates her for the lost work, or he sends her to Chupah at night or on Shabbos or Yom Tov (when she does not work)!</p></div>
<div class="indent1"><span class="nm">(g)</span><p><span class="cl">Answer #2:</span> The Hekesh (equating her to a slave) is not needed for a minor. Since he can sell her, obviously he owns her earnings!</p></div>
<div class="indent2"><span class="nm">1.</span><p>The Hekesh teaches about a Na'arah.</p></div>
<div class="indent1"><span class="nm">(h)</span><p><span class="cl">(Mishnah):</span> He can annul her vows.</p></div>
<div class="indent1"><span class="nm">(i)</span><p>We learn from "Bi'N'ureha Beis Aviha".</p></div>
<div class="indent1"><span class="nm">(j)</span><p><span class="cl">(Mishnah):</span> He can receive her Get.</p></div>
<div class="indent1"><span class="nm">(k)</span><p>"She was divorced... and became Mekudeshes" equates divorce and Kidushin;</p></div>
<div class="indent2"><span class="nm">1.</span><p>Just like he receives her Kidushin, he receives her Get.</p></div>
<div class="indent1"><span class="nm">(l)</span><p><span class="cl">(Beraisa):</span> A father does not eat the Peiros of his daughter's property in her lifetime;</p></div>
<div class="indent1"><span class="nm">(m)</span><p>R. Yosi bar Yehudah says, he does.</p></div>
<div class="indent1"><span class="nm">(n)</span><p>The first Tana holds that Chachamim enacted only for a husband to eat the Peiros of his wife's property. If not, he might not redeem her if she is captured;</p></div>
<div class="indent2"><span class="nm">1.</span><p>This concern does not apply regarding a father (he would redeem her in any case).</p></div>
<div class="indent1"><span class="nm">(o)</span><p>R. Yosi bar Yehudah says that the same concern applies to a father. He will resent that he did not benefit from her property.</p></div>
<div class="subject"><span class="nm">2)</span><p>IS A DOWRY COLLECTED IF SHE DIED BEFORE NISU'IN?</p></div>
<div class="indent1"><span class="nm">(a)</span><p><span class="cl">(Beraisa):</span> If a father wrote that he will send his daughter into Nisu'in with fruit, clothing and Kelim and she died during Eirusin, the husband does not receive them;</p></div>
<div class="indent1"><span class="nm">(b)</span><p>R. Nasan says that he does.</p></div>
<div class="indent1"><span class="nm">(c)</span><p><span class="cl">Suggestion:</span> These Tana'im argue like R. Elazar ben Azaryah and Chachamim:</p></div>
<div class="indent2"><span class="nm">1.</span><p><span class="cl">(Mishnah):</span> If she was widowed or divorced, whether from Eirusin or Nisu'in, she collects the entire Kesuvah;</p></div>
<div class="indent2"><span class="nm">2.</span><p>R. Elazar ben Azaryah says, if it was from Nisu'in she collects the full Kesuvah. If it was from Eirusin she collects only the basic Kesuvah (100 or 200).</p></div>
<div class="indent3"><span class="nm">i.</span><p>Anything above this was written only on condition that he make Nisu'in.</p></div>
<div class="bbbline">47b----------------------------------------47b</p></div>
<div class="indent2"><span class="nm">3.</span><p>Chachamim of the Beraisa say that he does not receive the dowry, like R. Elazar ben Azaryah. R. Nasan says that he receives it, like Chachamim of the Mishnah.</p></div>
<div class="indent1"><span class="nm">(d)</span><p><span class="cl">Rejection:</span> No, even R. Nasan holds like R. Elazar ben Azaryah;</p></div>
<div class="indent2"><span class="nm">1.</span><p>R. Elazar ben Azaryah said only that the husband pays Tosefes only if he did Nisu'in, but he could agree that her father gives even if they never have Nisu'in;</p></div>
<div class="indent2"><span class="nm">2.</span><p>The father gives because the families become united, and this happens through Kidushin.</p></div>
<div class="subject"><span class="nm">3)</span><p>THE OBLIGATION TO FEED ONE'S WIFE</p></div>
<div class="indent1"><span class="nm">(a)</span><p><span class="cl">(Beraisa):</span> Chachamim enacted that a man feed his wife, to compensate for receiving her earnings;</p></div>
<div class="indent1"><span class="nm">(b)</span><p>He must bury her, in exchange for inheriting her;</p></div>
<div class="indent1"><span class="nm">(c)</span><p>Therefore, he eats the Peiros of her property.</p></div>
<div class="indent1"><span class="nm">(d)</span><p><span class="cl">Objection:</span> The Beraisa did not mention Peiros!</p></div>
<div class="indent1"><span class="nm">(e)</span><p><span class="cl">Answer:</span> The Beraisa is abbreviated. It means as follows:</p></div>
<div class="indent2"><span class="nm">1.</span><p>Chachamim enacted that a man feed his wife, to compensate for receiving her earnings. He redeems her, in exchange for the Peiros of her property. He buries her, in exchange for inheriting her;</p></div>
<div class="indent2"><span class="nm">2.</span><p>Therefore, he eats the Peiros of her property.</p></div>
<div class="indent1"><span class="nm">(f)</span><p><span class="cl">Question:</span> Why does it say 'therefore'?</p></div>
<div class="indent1"><span class="nm">(g)</span><p><span class="cl">Answer:</span> One might have thought that he should not eat the fruit, rather it should be stored;</p></div>
<div class="indent2"><span class="nm">1.</span><p>This is not good, for when it does not suffice to redeem her he might refrain from paying the difference.</p></div>
<div class="indent1"><span class="nm">(h)</span><p><span class="cl">Question:</span> Why don't we say oppositely (that he feeds her in exchange for her Peiros, and redeems her in exchange for her earnings)?</p></div>
<div class="indent1"><span class="nm">(i)</span><p><span class="cl">Answer (Abaye):</span> Chachamim enacted what is common in exchange for what is common (food for earnings), and what is rare in exchange for what is rare (redemption for Peiros).</p></div>
<div class="indent1"><span class="nm">(j)</span><p><span class="cl">(Rava):</span> The following Tana holds that the Torah obligates a man to feed his wife:</p></div>
<div class="indent2"><span class="nm">1.</span><p><span class="cl">(Beraisa):</span> "She'erah" is food, like it says "Va'Asher Ochlu She'er Ami (they ate the flesh of my people)";</p></div>
<div class="indent2"><span class="nm">2.</span><p>"Kesusah" is understood simply (clothing);</p></div>
<div class="indent2"><span class="nm">3.</span><p>"Onasah" is the frequency of Bi'ah that the Torah commands, like it says, "If Ta'aneh (you will refrain from Bi'ah with) my daughters";</p></div>
<div class="indent2"><span class="nm">4.</span><p>R. Elazar says, "She'erah" is Bi'ah at the proper frequency, like it says "A man will not have Bi'ah with his She'er (relatives)";.</p></div>
<div class="indent2"><span class="nm">5.</span><p>"Kesusah" is understood simply;</p></div>
<div class="indent2"><span class="nm">6.</span><p>"Onasah" is food, like it says, "Va'Ya'ancha (He afflicted you and made you hungry)".</p></div>
