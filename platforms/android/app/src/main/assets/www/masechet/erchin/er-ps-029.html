<p class="bas subject"><span class="nm">1)</span>TO WHOM <i>CHEREM</i> IS GIVEN (cont).</p>
<p class="bas indent1"><span class="nm">(a)</span><span class="cl">(Gemara - Beraisa):</span> Chermei Kohanim cannot be redeemed. They are given to Kohanim;</p>
<p class="bas indent2"><span class="nm">1.</span>As long as the object of Cherem is with the one who was Makdish it, it is like Hekdesh in every respect - "Kol Cherem Kodesh Kodashim Hu la'Shem";</p>
<p class="bas indent2"><span class="nm">2.</span>Once it is given to a Kohen, it is like Chulin in every respect - "Kol Cherem b'Yisrael Lecha Yihyeh."</p>
<p class="bas indent1"><span class="nm">(b)</span><span class="cl">(Mishnah - R. Yehudah ben Beseira):</span> Stam Cherem becomes Bedek ha'Bayis...</p>
<p class="bas indent1"><span class="nm">(c)</span><span class="cl">Question:</span> We understand Chachamim. They learn from one verse, and explain how they expound R. Yehudah's verse;</p>
<p class="bas indent2"><span class="nm">1.</span>However, how does R. Yehudah expound "k'Sedeh ha'Cherem la'Kohen Tihyeh Achuzaso"?</p>
<p class="bas indent1"><span class="nm">(d)</span><span class="cl">Answer (Beraisa) Question:</span> What do we learn from "k'Sedeh ha'Cherem la'Kohen Tihyeh Achuzaso"?</p>
<p class="bas indent2"><span class="nm">1.</span><span class="cl">Answer:</span> This overrides the following Kal va'Chomer:</p>
<p class="bas indent3"><span class="nm">i.</span><span class="cl">Suggestion:</span> If a Kohen was Makdish a Sedeh Cherem (he received it because the original owner made it Cherem), perhaps he can say "I acquire things I had no rights to, such as a field made Hekdesh by a Yisrael. (If he does not redeem it, Kohanim receive it in Yovel.) All the more so, (in Yovel) I should keep this field, which I already have!"</p>
<p class="bas indent3"><span class="nm">ii.</span><span class="cl">Rejection:</span> It says "ki'Sedeh ha'Cherem la'Kohen Tihyeh Achuzaso."</p>
<p class="bas indent3"><span class="nm">iii.</span><span class="cl">Question:</span> The verse says that Achuzah is like Cherem, but we do not learn Achuzah from Cherem!</p>
<p class="bas indent3"><span class="nm">iv.</span><span class="cl">Answer:</span> Rather, We learn Cherem (of a Kohen) from Achuzah (of a Yisrael). Just like if a Yisrael was Makdish his Achuzah, it is divided among Kohanim in Yovel, the same applies if a Kohen was Makdish his Sedeh Cherem.</p>
<p class="bas indent1"><span class="nm">(e)</span><span class="cl">Question:</span> What is Chachamim's source for this law?</p>
<p class="bas indent1"><span class="nm">(f)</span><span class="cl">Answer:</span> They learn from the extra letter "Heh" in "ha'Cherem";</p>
<p class="bas indent2"><span class="nm">1.</span>R. Yehudah does not expound the "Heh."</p>
<p class="bas indent1"><span class="nm">(g)</span><span class="cl">Question:</span> What is R. Yehudah's source that Cherem takes effect on Kodshim?</p>
<p class="bas indent1"><span class="nm">(h)</span><span class="cl">Answer:</span> He learns like R. Yishmael (in the following Mishnah).</p>
<p class="bas indent1"><span class="nm">(i)</span><span class="cl">(Rav):</span> The Halachah follows R. Yehudah.</p>
<p class="bas indent1"><span class="nm">(j)</span><span class="cl">Question:</span> Why does Rav rule like R. Yehudah against Chachamim?!</p>
<p class="bas indent1"><span class="nm">(k)</span><span class="cl">Answer:</span> A Beraisa switches the opinions. (The Halachah follows Chachamim of the Beraisa, who hold like R. Yehudah in our Mishnah.)</p>
<p class="bas indent1"><span class="nm">(l)</span><span class="cl">Question:</span> Rav should rely on our Mishnah (and say that the Halachah follows Chachamim of our Mishnah), rather than on a Beraisa!</p>
<p class="bas indent1"><span class="nm">(m)</span><span class="cl">Answer:</span> Rav corrects the text of our Mishnah to read like the Beraisa.</p>
<p class="bas indent1"><span class="nm">(n)</span><span class="cl">Question:</span> Rather, he should correct the text of the Beraisa to read like our Mishnah!</p>
<p class="bas indent1"><span class="nm">(o)</span><span class="cl">Answer:</span> Rav had a tradition (from his Rebbi) to switch the opinions.</p>
<p class="bas indent1"><span class="nm">(p)</span><span class="cl">Question:</span> If so, he should say simply that the Halachah follows (the true opinion of) Chachamim!</p>
<p class="bas indent1"><span class="nm">(q)</span><span class="cl">Answer:</span> Rav ruled according to the (mistaken) version that most people knew.</p>

<p class="bas indent1"><span class="nm">(a)</span>A man in Pumbedisa was Macharim his property;</p>
<p class="bas indent2"><span class="nm">1.</span><span class="cl">Rav Yehudah:</span> Take four Zuz, redeem the property onto them and throw them in the river, then the property is permitted.</p>
<p class="bas indent2"><span class="nm">2.</span><span class="cl">Inference:</span> He holds that Stam Cherem is to Bedek ha'Bayis.</p>
<p class="bas indent1"><span class="nm">(b)</span><span class="cl">Suggestion:</span> This is like Shmuel:</p>
<p class="bas indent2"><span class="nm">1.</span><span class="cl">(Shmuel):</span> If Hekdesh of any value was redeemed onto a Perutah, the Hekdesh becomes Chulin.</p>
<p class="bas indent1"><span class="nm">(c)</span><span class="cl">Objection:</span> Shmuel's law is b'Di'eved. One may not do so l'Chatchilah!</p>
<p class="bas indent1"><span class="nm">(d)</span><span class="cl">Answer:</span> That is only when the Mikdash stands, for then there is a loss to Hekdesh;</p>
<p class="bas indent2"><span class="nm">1.</span>Nowadays, without a Mikdash (in any case we get rid of the redemption money, lest someone transgress Me'ilah), this is l'Chatchilah.</p>
<p class="bas indent1"><span class="nm">(e)</span><span class="cl">Question:</span> If so, a Perutah suffices. Why did Rav Yehudah tell him to redeem onto four Zuz?</p>
<p class="bas indent1"><span class="nm">(f)</span><span class="cl">Answer:</span> This was to publicize the redemption. (People knew about the Hekdesh.)</p>
<p class="bas indent1"><span class="nm">(g)</span><span class="cl">(Ula):</span> Had I been there, I would have given the property to Kohanim.</p>
<p class="bas indent1"><span class="nm">(h)</span><span class="cl">Inference:</span> Ula holds that Stam Cherem is given to Kohanim.</p>
<p class="bas indent1"><span class="nm">(i)</span><span class="cl">Question (against Rav Yehudah and Ula - Beraisa):</span> The following apply only when there is Yovel:</p>
<p class="bas indent2"><span class="nm">1.</span>(Rashi - becoming an) Eved Ivri. We learn from "Ad Shenas ha'Yovel Ya'avod Imach";</p>
<p class="bas indent2"><span class="nm">2.</span>(The right to buy back a sold) Sedeh Achuzah. We learn from "v'Yatza ba'Yovel v'Shav la'Achuzaso";</p>
<p class="bas indent2"><span class="nm">3.</span>(The right to redeem) Bayis Ir Chomah (a house in a walled city that he sold). We learn from "Lo Yetze ba'Yovel";</p>
<p class="bas indent2"><span class="nm">4.</span>R. Shimon says, Sedeh Cherem applies only when there is Yovel. We learn from "v'Hayah ha'Sadeh b'Tzeiso va'Yovel k'Sedeh ha'Cherem."</p>
<p class="bas indent2"><span class="nm">5.</span>R. Shimon ben Elazar says, the law of (supporting) a Ger Toshav applies only when there is Yovel.</p>
<p class="bas indent2"><span class="nm">6.</span><span class="cl">(Rav Bivi):</span> He learns from a Gezeirah Shavah "Tov-Tov." It says (regarding Ger Toshav) "(Imcha Yeshev b'Kirbecha)... ba'Tov Lo," like it says regarding Eved Ivri "Ki Tov Lo Imach."</p>
<p class="bas indent1"><span class="nm">(j)</span><span class="cl">Answer:</span> Cherem applies to land only when there is Yovel. It applies to Metaltelim at all times.</p>
<p class="bas indent1"><span class="nm">(k)</span><span class="cl">Question:</span> The case in Pumbedisa involved land!</p>
<p class="bas indent1"><span class="nm">(l)</span><span class="cl">Answer:</span> Land of Chutz la'Aretz is like Metaltelim of Eretz Yisrael (since Yovel does not apply to it).</p>
<p class="bas subject"><span class="nm">3)</span>HEKDESH OF A BECHOR</p>
<p class="bas indent1"><span class="nm">(a)</span><span class="cl">(Mishnah - R. Yishmael) Contradiction:</span> One verse says "Takdish" (a Bechor), and another verse says "Lo Yakdish"!</p>
<p class="bas indent1"><span class="nm">(b)</span><span class="cl">Resolution:</span> You may be Makdish it with Hekdesh Iluy (to give Tovas Hana'ah to a Kohen). You may not (try to) be Makdish it with Hekdesh Mizbe'ach (to make it a different Korban).</p>
<p class="bas indent1"><span class="nm">(c)</span><span class="cl">(Gemara):</span> Chachamim say that "Lo Yakdish" is a Lav (do not try to make it a different Korban). They expound Takdish as follows;</p>
<p class="bas indent2"><span class="nm">1.</span><span class="cl">(Beraisa) Question:</span> What is the source that when a Bechor is born, it is a Mitzvah to be Makdish it (with Kedushas Bechor)?</p>
<p class="bas indent2"><span class="nm">2.</span><span class="cl">Answer:</span> It says "ha'Zachar Takdish."</p>
<p class="bas indent1"><span class="nm">(d)</span>R. Yishmael says, since it becomes Kodesh automatically, it is unreasonable to say that there is a Mitzvah to be Makdish it.</p>

<p class="bas subject"><span class="nm">4)</span>ONE MAY NOT REDEEM WITHIN TWO YEARS</p>
<p class="bas indent1"><span class="nm">(a)</span><span class="cl">(Mishnah):</span> If one sold his field at a time when Yovel applies, he may not redeem it before two years. We learn from "b'Mispar Shenei Tevu'os Yimkar Lach";</p>
<p class="bas indent1"><span class="nm">(b)</span>Shemitah, or a year in which crops (everywhere) were blasted of stricken with mildew does not count towards the two years. (They must be years of harvests.)</p>
<p class="bas indent1"><span class="nm">(c)</span>If he Narah (plowed the field but did not plant anything), or Hovirah (left it fallow), this counts towards the two years.</p>
<p class="bas indent1"><span class="nm">(d)</span>R. Eliezer says, if a field was sold before Rosh Hashanah laden with produce, the buyer eats three harvests in two years.</p>
<p class="bas indent1"><span class="nm">(e)</span><span class="cl">(Gemara):</span> The Mishnah does not say 'he does not (have the right to) redeem (within two years)', rather, 'he may not redeem.' He may not even show the money to the buyer (showing that he wants to redeem);</p>
<p class="bas indent2"><span class="nm">1.</span>The seller transgresses an Aseh (if he redeems early) - "b'Mispar Shenei Tevu'os Yimkar Lach." Further, also the buyer transgresses an Aseh - "Shanim... Tikneh."</p>
<p class="bas subject"><span class="nm">5)</span>SELLING A FIELD IN <i>YOVEL</i></p>
<p class="bas indent1"><span class="nm">(a)</span><span class="cl">(Rav):</span> If one sold his field in Yovel, it is sold, and it returns to the seller;</p>
<p class="bas indent1"><span class="nm">(b)</span><span class="cl">(Shmuel):</span> It is not sold at all.</p>
<p class="bas indent1"><span class="nm">(c)</span><span class="cl">Question:</span> What is Shmuel's reason?</p>
<p class="bas indent1"><span class="nm">(d)</span><span class="cl">Answer:</span> He learns from a Kal va'Chomer:</p>
<p class="bas indent2"><span class="nm">1.</span>A field sold before Yovel returns to the original owner in Yovel. All the more so a field cannot be sold!</p>
<p class="bas indent1"><span class="nm">(e)</span><span class="cl">Question:</span> Surely, Rav also learns from such a Kal va'Chomer!</p>
<p class="bas indent2"><span class="nm">1.</span><span class="cl">(Beraisa) Suggestion:</span> Perhaps a man can sell his daughter (to be a slave) when she is a Na'arah!</p>
<p class="bas indent2"><span class="nm">2.</span><span class="cl">Rejection:</span> A Kal va'Chomer refutes this! A girl who was sold goes free when she becomes a Na'arah. All the more so a Na'arah cannot be sold! (Surely, Rav agrees with this law!)</p>
<p class="bas indent1"><span class="nm">(f)</span><span class="cl">Answer:</span> There is different, for a girl can never be sold after Na'arus, but a field that returns in Yovel can be sold again.</p>
<p class="bas indent1"><span class="nm">(g)</span><span class="cl">Question (against Rav - Beraisa):</span> 'Achar ha'Yovel Shanim Tikneh' (the Beraisa transposes the verse slightly) teaches that one may sell shortly after Yovel;</p>
<p class="bas indent2"><span class="nm">1.</span><span class="cl">Question:</span> What is the source to permit selling many years after Yovel?</p>
<p class="bas indent2"><span class="nm">2.</span><span class="cl">Answer:</span> It says "l'Fi Rov ha'Shanim... ul'Fi Me'at ha'Shanim."</p>
<p class="bas indent2"><span class="nm">3.</span>In the Yovel year itself, one may not sell. If he sold, it is not sold.</p>
<p class="bas indent1"><span class="nm">(h)</span><span class="cl">Answer (Rav):</span> It means that in Yovel itself, one may not sell. If he sold, it is not sold for years of harvests, but it is sold and returns to the seller.</p>
<p class="bas indent1"><span class="nm">(i)</span><span class="cl">Question:</span> If it is sold, the buyer should keep it for two years of harvests after Yovel!</p>
<p class="bas indent2"><span class="nm">1.</span><span class="cl">(Beraisa):</span> If one bought a field and had only one harvest year before Yovel, he keeps it for another harvest year after Yovel.</p>
<p class="bas indent1"><span class="nm">(j)</span><span class="cl">Answer:</span> There is different. Since he already acquired the land for its produce before Yovel, he gets the completion of the two years after Yovel;</p>
<p class="bas indent2"><span class="nm">1.</span>Here, he never acquired the land for its produce.</p>
<p class="bas indent1"><span class="nm">(k)</span><span class="cl">(Mishnah):</span> If one sold his (Kena'ani) slave to a Nochri or to (a Yisrael in) Chutz la'Aretz, the slave goes free.</p>
<p class="bas indent1"><span class="nm">(l)</span><span class="cl">Question (Rav Anan):</span> I heard Shmuel say that in one case (this Mishnah, or a field sold in Yovel) the buyer gets back his money, and in the other, he does not. I do not know which was which! (Even if Shmuel agrees with Rav that the seller keeps the money, he (argues with him and) says that it is not sold regarding trees or produce that the buyer detached, Metaltelim acquired Agav (with) the land (Rashi), or forcing the buyer to pay (if he acquired it without paying - R. Akiva Eiger).)</p>
<p class="bas indent1"><span class="nm">(m)</span><span class="cl">Answer (Rav Yosef - Beraisa):</span> If one sold his slave to Chutz la'Aretz, the slave goes free, and he needs a Get Shichrur (document of freedom) from his second owner.</p>
<p class="bas indent2"><span class="nm">1.</span>Since the buyer is called the (second) owner (and he writes the Get), this shows that he does not get his money back;</p>
