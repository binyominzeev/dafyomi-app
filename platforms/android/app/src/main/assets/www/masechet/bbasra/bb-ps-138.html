<p class="bas subject"><span class="nm">1)</span>ONE WHO REFUSES TO RECEIVE A GIFT (cont.)</p>
<p class="bas indent1"><span class="nm">(a)</span><span class="cl">(R. Aba bar Mamal):</span> They do not argue. R. Yochanan discusses one who protested from the beginning. Rav Yehudah discusses one who was initially quiet and later protested.</p>
<p class="bas indent1"><span class="nm">(b)</span><span class="cl">(Rav Nachman bar Yitzchak):</span> If Shimon acquired a gift on behalf of Yehudah, and Yehudah was initially quiet and later protested, R. Shimon ben Gamliel and Chachamim argue about this.</p>
<p class="bas indent2"><span class="nm">1.</span><span class="cl">(Beraisa):</span> If Reuven wrote his property, which included slaves, to Levi, and Levi said 'I do not want it', if Levi is a Kohen, the slaves may eat Terumah (they are his slaves);</p>
<p class="bas indent2"><span class="nm">2.</span>R. Shimon ben Gamliel says, since he said 'I do not want it', (Reuven or) his heirs acquire.</p>
<p class="bas indent2"><span class="nm">3.</span><span class="cl">Question:</span> Does the first Tana say that he acquires, even if he screams in protest?!</p>
<p class="bas indent2"><span class="nm">4.</span><span class="cl">Answer (Rava):</span> If he protested from the beginning, all agree that he does not acquire;</p>
<p class="bas indent3"><span class="nm">i.</span>If he was initially quiet and later protested, all agree that he acquired;</p>
<p class="bas indent3"><span class="nm">ii.</span>They argue about when Shimon acquired on behalf of Levi, and Levi was initially quiet and later protested. Chachamim say that once he was silent, he acquired. Now he protests for he wants to (but cannot) retract;</p>
<p class="bas indent3"><span class="nm">iii.</span>R. Shimon ben Gamliel says, his later protest shows that he never wanted the property. Initially, he felt no need to protest, for the property did not yet come to him.</p>
<p class="bas subject"><span class="nm">2)</span>ADDITIONAL GIFTS</p>
<p class="bas indent1"><span class="nm">(a)</span><span class="cl">(Beraisa):</span> If Ploni (a Shechiv Mera) said 'give 200 Zuz (worth of land) to Reuven, 300 to Shimon, and 400 to Levi', we do not say that they acquire in this order (and Ploni's creditor would collect first from the last land given, i.e. from Levi). Rather, a creditor (with a loan document) collects from all of them;</p>
<p class="bas indent2"><span class="nm">1.</span>If he said 'give 200 to Reuven, after him give (300) to Shimon, and after him (400) to Levi', they acquire in this order. A creditor collects first from Levi, then (if he was owed more than 200) from Shimon, and then from Reuven.</p>
<p class="bas indent1"><span class="nm">(b)</span><span class="cl">(Beraisa):</span> If a Shechiv Mera said 'give 200 Zuz to Ploni my son, the firstborn, like is fitting for him', he receives it in addition to his extra share;</p>
<p class="bas indent2"><span class="nm">1.</span>If he said 'give to him 200 for his Bechorah (i.e. his extra share)', Ploni has the upper hand. He can take 200 in place of his Bechorah, or he can take his normal Bechorah.</p>
<p class="bas indent1"><span class="nm">(c)</span>If a Shechiv Mera said 'give 200 Zuz to my wife, like is fitting for her' - she receives it in addition to her Kesuvah;</p>
<p class="bas indent2"><span class="nm">1.</span>If he said 'give to her 200 for her Kesuvah' (not in a case in which she pardons the rest of her Kesuvah), she has the upper hand. She can take 200 in place of her Kesuvah, or she can take her Kesuvah.</p>
<p class="bas bbbline">138b----------------------------------------138b</p>
<p class="bas indent1"><span class="nm">(d)</span>If a Shechiv Mera said 'give 200 Zuz to Ploni my creditor, like is fitting for him', he receives it in addition to the debt;</p>
<p class="bas indent2"><span class="nm">1.</span>If he said 'give to him 200 for the loan', he takes it in place of the loan.</p>
<p class="bas indent1"><span class="nm">(e)</span><span class="cl">Question:</span> When he said 'like is fitting for him', why does Ploni receive it in addition to the debt? Perhaps he meant 'like I owe him'!</p>
<p class="bas indent1"><span class="nm">(f)</span><span class="cl">Answer (Rav Nachman):</span> The Beraisa is R. Akiva, who expounds extra words.</p>
<p class="bas indent2"><span class="nm">1.</span><span class="cl">(Mishnah - R. Akiva):</span> If Reuven sold his house to Shimon, Shimon does not acquire the pit and cistern, even if Reuven wrote 'the depth and height';</p>
<p class="bas indent2"><span class="nm">2.</span>(If Reuven wants to use them) he must buy the rights to a path to them.</p>
<p class="bas indent2"><span class="nm">3.</span>Chachamim say, (he may use them, and) he need not buy a path.</p>
<p class="bas indent2"><span class="nm">4.</span>R. Akiva admits, if Reuven sold his house 'except for the pit and cistern', he need not buy a path.</p>
<p class="bas indent3"><span class="nm">i.</span>Since he wrote this, even though there was no need for it, it comes to add something (a path).</p>
<p class="bas indent2"><span class="nm">5.</span><span class="cl">Culmination of answer:</span> Here also, the extra words 'like is fitting for him' add (that the 200 is in addition to the debt).</p>
<p class="bas subject"><span class="nm">3)</span>ARE WE CONCERNED LEST BEIS DIN ERR?</p>
<p class="bas indent1"><span class="nm">(a)</span><span class="cl">(Beraisa - R. Meir):</span> If a Shechiv Mera said 'Ploni owes me 200 Zuz', the witnesses write this, even though they do not know whether or not it is true;</p>
<p class="bas indent2"><span class="nm">1.</span>Therefore, the heir must bring proof to collect it.</p>
<p class="bas indent1"><span class="nm">(b)</span>Chachamim say, the witnesses may not write this unless they know that it is true. Therefore, the heir collects it without proof.</p>
<p class="bas indent1"><span class="nm">(c)</span><span class="cl">(Rav Nachman):</span> The opinions must be switched. R. Meir forbids writing if they do not know, and Chachamim permit;</p>
<p class="bas indent2"><span class="nm">1.</span>R. Meir forbids them to write because we are concerned lest a Beis Din err (and not require the heir to bring proof).</p>
<p class="bas indent1"><span class="nm">(d)</span><span class="cl">(Rav Dimi of Neharde'a):</span> The Halachah is, we are not concerned lest a Beis Din err.</p>
<p class="bas indent1"><span class="nm">(e)</span><span class="cl">Question:</span> Why is this different than Rava's law?</p>
<p class="bas indent2"><span class="nm">1.</span><span class="cl">(Rava):</span> Beis Din oversees Chalitzah only if they recognize (that she is a Yevamah and that this is her Yavam). Beis Din oversees Mi'un (a girl annulling her marriage) only if they recognize (the couple, and that she is married only mid'Rabanan).</p>
<p class="bas indent2"><span class="nm">2.</span>Therefore, witnesses (who see Chalitzah or Mi'un in front of Beis Din) may write a document of Chalitzah or Mi'un even if they do not recognize.</p>
<p class="bas indent2"><span class="nm">3.</span><span class="cl">Inference:</span> We require Beis Din to know, for we are concerned lest another Beis Din err.</p>
<p class="bas indent1"><span class="nm">(f)</span><span class="cl">Answer:</span> Regarding Chalitzah and Mi'un, we are concerned lest (a second) Beis Din will not check for themselves. Rather they will rely on the Beis Din that witnessed it;</p>
<p class="bas indent2"><span class="nm">1.</span>We are not concerned lest a Beis Din rely on witnesses (e.g. who signed a gift of a Shechiv Mera). Surely Beis Din themselves will verify what is written.</p>
<p class="bas subject"><span class="nm">4)</span>ARE ATTACHED PEROS INCLUDED IN A GIFT?</p>
<p class="bas indent1"><span class="nm">(a)</span><span class="cl">(Mishnah):</span> (If a father wrote his property to a son 'from today and after I die',) the father may harvest the Peros and give it to whomever he wants;</p>
<p class="bas indent2"><span class="nm">1.</span>After he dies, if he left harvested Peros, they belong to the heirs.</p>
<p class="bas indent1"><span class="nm">(b)</span><span class="cl">(Gemara) Inference:</span> What is attached does not belong to the heirs.</p>
