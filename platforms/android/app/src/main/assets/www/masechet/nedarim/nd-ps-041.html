<p class="bas subject"><span class="nm">1)</span>KNOWLEDGE IS EVERYTHING</p>
<p class="bas indent1"><span class="nm">(a)</span><span class="cl">(R. Ami):</span> "Make for yourself Kelim of exile" - these are a lamp, a bowl, and a leather mat to eat on.</p>
<p class="bas indent2"><span class="nm">1.</span><span class="cl">(R. Ami):</span> "Lacking everything" refers to one who lacks a lamp and a table;</p>
<p class="bas indent2"><span class="nm">2.</span><span class="cl">(Rav Chisda):</span> It refers to one who lacks a wife;</p>
<p class="bas indent2"><span class="nm">3.</span><span class="cl">(Rav Sheshes):</span> It refers to one who lacks an attendant;</p>
<p class="bas indent2"><span class="nm">4.</span><span class="cl">(Rav Nachman):</span> It refers to one who lacks knowledge;</p>
<p class="bas indent2"><span class="nm">5.</span><span class="cl">(Beraisa):</span> It refers to one who lacks salt and oil.</p>
<p class="bas indent1"><span class="nm">(b)</span><span class="cl">(Abaye):</span> True poverty is lack of knowledge.</p>
<p class="bas indent1"><span class="nm">(c)</span><span class="cl">(Chachamim of Eretz Yisrael):</span> If one has knowledge, he has everything. If one lacks knowledge, what does he have?!</p>
<p class="bas indent2"><span class="nm">1.</span>If he acquires knowledge, he has everything. If he does not acquire knowledge, he does acquire anything (that will benefit from).</p>
<p class="bas indent1"><span class="nm">(d)</span><span class="cl">(R. Alexandri):</span> A sick person is not cured until all his sins are pardoned - "the One who forgives all my sins, who heals all my ailments."</p>
<p class="bas indent1"><span class="nm">(e)</span><span class="cl">(Rav Hamnuna):</span> (A sick person who is cured) returns to his youth (i.e. healthier than before the illness) - "Rutafash (this is like Ratuv Pash, will become moist and increase) his flesh from having been agitated; he will return to the days of his youth."</p>
<p class="bas indent1"><span class="nm">(f)</span><span class="cl">(Rav Yosef):</span> "In his sickness, You reversed all his lying down" - he forgets his learning. (Maharsha - perhaps this verse should be deleted. We learn from the previous verse, he returns to Alumav, i.e. the period of Ha'alamah (unawareness).)</p>
<p class="bas indent2"><span class="nm">1.</span>Rav Yosef fell sick and forgot his learning. Abaye restored it to him.</p>
<p class="bas indent2"><span class="nm">2.</span>In many places, Rav Yosef said he never heard a certain teaching, and Abaye reminded him that Rav Yosef himself taught that teaching, and reminded him about the source.</p>
<p class="bas indent1"><span class="nm">(g)</span>Rebbi used to learn 13 facets of each law. He taught to R. Chiya seven of them. Rebbi fell sick and forgot his learning; R. Chiya taught him the seven facets he had received, and six were missing.</p>
<p class="bas indent2"><span class="nm">1.</span>There was a launderer who used to hear Rebbi learn. R. Chiya learned the other six from him, and taught them back to Rebbi.</p>
<p class="bas indent2"><span class="nm">2.</span><span class="cl">Version #1:</span> When Rebbi would see the launderer, he would say 'you made me and R. Chiya (complete in Torah)'.</p>
<p class="bas indent2"><span class="nm">3.</span><span class="cl">Version #2:</span> He would say 'you made R. Chiya, and R. Chiya made me'.</p>
<p class="bas subject"><span class="nm">2)</span>DIVINE PROVIDENCE</p>
<p class="bas indent1"><span class="nm">(a)</span><span class="cl">(R. Alexandri):</span> The miracle done for a Choleh (who recovers) is greater than the miracle that was done for Chananyah, Michael and Azaryah.</p>
<p class="bas indent2"><span class="nm">1.</span>The fire they entered was manmade, and anyone could extinguish it. The fire of a Choleh is from Hash-m. Who can extinguish it?!</p>
<p class="bas indent1"><span class="nm">(b)</span><span class="cl">(R. Alexandri or R. Yehoshua ben Levi):</span> Once a person's time to die comes, everything rules over him. (Kayin said) "whatever finds me will kill me."</p>
<p class="bas indent2"><span class="nm">1.</span><span class="cl">(Rav):</span> We learn this from "They stand today to Your judgments, for they are all Your slaves."</p>
<p class="bas indent1"><span class="nm">(c)</span>They told Rabah bar Shilo that a tall man is about to die. The man was riding on a small mule. When he was crossing a bridge, the mule went crazy and threw him into the water. While he was dying, he said about himself "they stand today to Your judgments."</p>
<p class="bas indent1"><span class="nm">(d)</span>Shmuel saw a scorpion on top of a frog. The frog took it across a river; the scorpion bit a person, and he died - "they stand today to Your judgments."</p>
<p class="bas subject"><span class="nm">3)</span>WHOM WE DO NOT VISIT</p>
<p class="bas indent1"><span class="nm">(a)</span><span class="cl">(Shmuel):</span> The only sick person one should visit is one with a fever.</p>
<p class="bas indent1"><span class="nm">(b)</span><span class="cl">Question:</span> What does he come to exclude?</p>
<p class="bas indent1"><span class="nm">(c)</span><span class="cl">Answer (Beraisa - R. Yosi ben Parta):</span> We do not visit those with intestinal sickness, nor those with eye problems, nor those with headaches.</p>
<p class="bas indent1"><span class="nm">(d)</span><span class="cl">Question:</span> Why don't we?</p>
<p class="bas indent2"><span class="nm">1.</span>Granted, one with intestinal sickness is embarrassed to have visitors.</p>
<p class="bas indent2"><span class="nm">2.</span>But why don't we visit those with eye problems and headaches?</p>
<p class="bas indent1"><span class="nm">(e)</span><span class="cl">Answer:</span> It is due to Rav Yehudah's teaching, that speaking hurts the eyes and head.</p>
<p class="bas indent1"><span class="nm">(f)</span><span class="cl">(Rava):</span> If a fever was not the Shali'ach of the angel of death, a monthly fever would protect a person like Chizra (prickly shoots that grow around the base of a palm tree to protect it from animals) for the tree and medicine for the body.</p>
<p class="bas bbbline">41b----------------------------------------41b</p>
<p class="bas indent1"><span class="nm">(g)</span><span class="cl">(Rav Nachman bar Yitzchak):</span> We do not desire fevers, nor their benefits.</p>
<p class="bas indent1"><span class="nm">(h)</span><span class="cl">(Rabah bar Yonasan):</span> Arsan helps cure a sick person.</p>
<p class="bas indent1"><span class="nm">(i)</span><span class="cl">Question:</span> What is Arsan?</p>
<p class="bas indent1"><span class="nm">(j)</span><span class="cl">Answer #1 (R. Yonasan):</span> It is old barley without the shell at the beginning of sifting;</p>
<p class="bas indent2"><span class="nm">1.</span><span class="cl">(Abaye):</span> It must be cooked (greatly,) like ox meat.</p>
<p class="bas indent1"><span class="nm">(k)</span><span class="cl">Answer #2 (Rav Yosef):</span> It is flour of old barley at the beginning of sifting;</p>
<p class="bas indent2"><span class="nm">1.</span><span class="cl">(Abaye):</span> It must be cooked like ox meat.</p>
<p class="bas indent1"><span class="nm">(l)</span><span class="cl">(R. Yochanan):</span> We do not visit those with Bordam (a flowing of blood; some explain, diarrhea), and we do not mention the name (of the illness).</p>
<p class="bas indent2"><span class="nm">1.</span><span class="cl">(R. Elazar):</span> This is because it is like a flowing spring (and he is embarrassed).</p>
<p class="bas indent2"><span class="nm">2.</span>It is called Bordam for it is like Bor Dam (a well of blood).</p>
<p class="bas subject"><span class="nm">4)</span>MONETARY <i>REFU'AH</i></p>
<p class="bas indent1"><span class="nm">(a)</span><span class="cl">(Mishnah):</span> He may cure his body...</p>
<p class="bas indent1"><span class="nm">(b)</span><span class="cl">Question:</span> What is the difference between bodily and monetary Refu'ah?</p>
<p class="bas indent2"><span class="nm">1.</span><span class="cl">Suggestion:</span> Bodily Refu'ah is for free. Monetary Refu'ah is for wages (and the Mishnah discusses when the doctor may not benefit from the Choleh).</p>
<p class="bas indent2"><span class="nm">2.</span><span class="cl">Rejection:</span> If so, the Mishnah should say that he may heal him for free, but not for wages!</p>
<p class="bas indent1"><span class="nm">(c)</span><span class="cl">Answer:</span> Rather, bodily Refu'ah is himself, and monetary Refu'ah is his animal. (The Mishnah discusses when the Choleh may not benefit from the doctor. Refu'ah is a Mitzvah, so we do not take wages for it.)</p>
<p class="bas indent2"><span class="nm">1.</span><span class="cl">(Rav Zutra bar Tuvya):</span> (Even regarding his animal,) he may tell him which medicines will help, and which will harm.</p>
<p class="bas subject"><span class="nm">5)</span>JOINT ACTIVITIES.</p>
<p class="bas indent1"><span class="nm">(a)</span><span class="cl">(Mishnah):</span> If Reuven is Mudar Hana'ah from Shimon, he may bathe with him in a big bathtub, but not in a small one;</p>
<p class="bas indent1"><span class="nm">(b)</span>He may sleep with him in a bed;</p>
<p class="bas indent1"><span class="nm">(c)</span>R. Yehudah says, this is permitted in summer, but not in winter, for he benefits him.</p>
<p class="bas indent1"><span class="nm">(d)</span>He may sit with him on a bed, and eat with him at a table, but he may not eat with him from a platter;</p>
<p class="bas indent2"><span class="nm">1.</span>He may eat with him from a platter that returns.</p>
<p class="bas indent1"><span class="nm">(e)</span><span class="cl">(Gemara - Beraisa - R. Meir):</span> He may not bathe with him in a bathtub, nor sleep with him in a bed, whether big or small;</p>
<p class="bas indent1"><span class="nm">(f)</span>R. Yehudah says, a large bed is permitted in winter, and even a small bed in summer;</p>
<p class="bas indent1"><span class="nm">(g)</span>He may bathe with him in a big bathtub, and be in a steambath with him even if it is small.</p>
<p class="bas indent1"><span class="nm">(h)</span><span class="cl">(Mishnah):</span> He may sit with him on a bed, and eat with him at a table, but he may not eat with him from a platter. He may eat with him from a platter that returns.</p>
<p class="bas indent2"><span class="nm">1.</span><span class="cl">(R. Yosi bar Chanina):</span> This refers to a platter that returns to the host (with food. Whether or not Shimon eats, there will be enough for Reuven.)</p>
<p class="bas indent1"><span class="nm">(i)</span><span class="cl">(Mishnah - R. Meir):</span> He may not eat with him from a food bin set out in front of workers. He may not plow with him in the same row;</p>
<p class="bas indent2"><span class="nm">1.</span>Chachamim say that if he is far from him, this is permitted.</p>
<p class="bas indent1"><span class="nm">(j)</span><span class="cl">(Gemara):</span> All agree that they may not plow close together. They argue only when they are far apart;</p>
<p class="bas indent2"><span class="nm">1.</span>R. Meir decrees due to the case when they are close, for then Shimon softens the ground for Reuven. Chachamim do not decree.</p>
