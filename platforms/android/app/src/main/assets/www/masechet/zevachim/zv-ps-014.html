<div class="indent1"><span class="nm">(a)</span><p><span class="cl">Suggestion:</span> The following Tana'im argue about whether dipping the finger is like Holachah.</p></div>
<div class="indent2"><span class="nm">1.</span><p><span class="cl">(Beraisa #1):</span> In Chatas, dipping the finger is Mefagel.</p></div>
<div class="indent2"><span class="nm">2.</span><p><span class="cl">(Beraisa #2):</span> It does not make Pigul (if he dipped his finger with intent of Chutz li'Zmano), and it is not the object of Pigul (if he slaughtered with intent to dip his finger Chutz li'Zmano).</p></div>
<div class="indent1"><span class="nm">(b)</span><p><span class="cl">Rejection #1:</span> No, all agree that dipping the finger is like Holachah;</p></div>
<div class="indent2"><span class="nm">1.</span><p>Beraisa #1 is Chachamim (who say that Holachah is Mefagel). Beraisa #2 is R. Shimon (who says that Holachah is not Mefagel).</p></div>
<div class="indent1"><span class="nm">(c)</span><p><span class="cl">Objection:</span> If it is R. Shimon, why does it mention dipping the finger? He says that Pigul applies only to Korbanos of the outer Mizbeach!</p></div>
<div class="indent1"><span class="nm">(d)</span><p><span class="cl">Rejection #2:</span> Rather, both Beraisos are Chachamim. Beraisa #1 refers to inner Chata'os, and Beraisa #2 refers to outer Chata'os.</p></div>
<div class="indent1"><span class="nm">(e)</span><p><span class="cl">Question:</span> Obviously, dipping the finger does not make Pigul in outer Chata'os. The Torah does not say to dip the finger!</p></div>
<div class="indent1"><span class="nm">(f)</span><p><span class="cl">Answer:</span> Since it says "v'Lakach", and the Kohen must dip his finger (even if a monkey put the blood on the Kohen's finger), one might have thought that it is as if it says 'v'Taval';</p></div>
<div class="indent2"><span class="nm">1.</span><p>The Torah did not write 'v'Taval', to teach that this is not an important Avodah, so it does not make Pigul.</p></div>
<div class="subject"><span class="nm">2)</span><p>R. SHIMON'S OPINION ABOUT <i>HOLACHAH</i></p></div>
<div class="indent1"><span class="nm">(a)</span><p><span class="cl">(Mishnah - R. Shimon):</span> (Improper intent in) Holachah does not disqualify.</p></div>
<div class="indent1"><span class="nm">(b)</span><p><span class="cl">(Reish Lakish):</span> R. Shimon agrees that Holachah disqualifies in inner Chata'os, because it is essential. (The Korban cannot be slaughtered in the Heichal. The blood must be brought inside.)</p></div>
<div class="indent1"><span class="nm">(c)</span><p><span class="cl">Question:</span> R. Shimon says that Pigul applies only to Korbanos of the outer Mizbeach!</p></div>
<div class="indent1"><span class="nm">(d)</span><p><span class="cl">Answer (R. Yosi b'Rebbi Chanina):</span> He says that Pigul (with Kares) applies only to Korbanos of the outer Mizbeach, but a Kal va'Chomer teaches that even inner Chata'os can become Pasul;</p></div>
<div class="indent2"><span class="nm">1.</span><p>Lo Lishmah does not disqualify Shelamim, but it disqualifies Chatas. Chutz li'Zmano disqualifies Shelamim, all the more so it disqualifies Chatas!</p></div>
<div class="indent1"><span class="nm">(e)</span><p><span class="cl">Question:</span> This teaches Chutz li'Zmano. What is the source for Chutz li'Mkomo?</p></div>
<div class="indent2"><span class="nm">1.</span><p>We cannot learn from Chutz li'Zmano, which causes (in other Korbanos Pigul, which has) liability for Kares!</p></div>
<div class="indent2"><span class="nm">2.</span><p>We cannot learn from Lo Lishmah, which applies even to a Bamah (private Mizbeach, but Chutz li'Mkomo does not apply to a Bamah)!</p></div>
<div class="indent1"><span class="nm">(f)</span><p><span class="cl">Answer #1:</span> We can learn from Lo Lishmah. This disqualifies only in Chatas and Pesach, which are not brought on Bamos!</p></div>
<div class="indent1"><span class="nm">(g)</span><p><span class="cl">Answer #2:</span> The Torah equates Chutz li'Zmano and Chutz li'Mkomo;</p></div>
<div class="indent2"><span class="nm">1.</span><p>"Shelishi" refers to Chutz li'Zmano; "Pigul" refers to Chutz li'Mkomo.</p></div>
<div class="indent1"><span class="nm">(h)</span><p><span class="cl">(Rava):</span> (The Ulam is the building in front of the Heichal. R. Elazar b'Rebbi Shimon holds that between the Ulam and the Mizbeach is like the north half of the Azarah, i.e. one may slaughter Kodshei Kodoshim there.) If R. Shimon agrees with R. Elazar, he will say that (improper intent during) Holachah disqualifies inner Chata'os only from the opening of the Ulam and inside (for they could have been slaughtered right by the opening. It was not necessary to (slaughter them further away and) take the blood to the Ulam;</p></div>
<div class="indent2"><span class="nm">1.</span><p>If he holds like R. Yehudah (who permits burning Eimurim on the floor of the Azarah, just like on the Mizbeach), he will say that Holachah of frankincense (that accompanies the Lechem ha'Panim on the Shulchan, and is burned on the Mizbeach) disqualifies only from the opening of the Heichal until the opening of the Ulam (because the Shulchan could have been placed right by the opening of the Heichal, and the frankincense could have been burned right outside the Ulam);</p></div>
<div class="indent2"><span class="nm">2.</span><p>If he also holds that the Ulam has the Kedushah of the Heichal (so the Shulchan could be placed anywhere in the interior of the Ulam) he will say that Holachah disqualifies the frankincense only in the opening of the Ulam (the area corresponding to the thickness of the walls);</p></div>
<div class="indent2"><span class="nm">3.</span><p>If he holds that even that area has Kedushas Heichal, Holachah disqualifies only for the distance to stretch one's hand from the (end of the) opening of the Ulam to the floor of the Azarah;</p></div>
<div class="indent2"><span class="nm">4.</span><p>If he also holds that Holachah disqualifies only when walking (not when just moving his hand), Holachah cannot disqualify the frankincense at all.</p></div>
<div class="subject"><span class="nm">3)</span><p>IF A <i>ZAR</i> DID <i>HOLACHAH</i></p></div>
<div class="indent1"><span class="nm">(a)</span><p><span class="cl">Question (Abaye):</span> If a Zar did Holachah, what is the law?</p></div>
<div class="indent1"><span class="nm">(b)</span><p><span class="cl">Answer (Rav Chisda):</span> It is Kosher - "va'Yishchatu ha'Pasach va'Yizreku ha'Kohanim mi'Yadam" (the Yisraelim did Holachah)!</p></div>
<div class="indent1"><span class="nm">(c)</span><p><span class="cl">Question (Rav Sheshes - Beraisa):</span> If a Zar, Onen (one who lost a relative that day), or an intoxicated or blemished Kohen did Kabalah, Holachah or Zerikah, the Korban is Pasul. The same applies if the Avodah was done sitting or with the left hand.</p></div>
<div class="bbbline">14b----------------------------------------14b</p></div>
<div class="indent2"><span class="nm">1.</span><p>This refutes Rav Chisda.</p></div>
<div class="indent1"><span class="nm">(d)</span><p><span class="cl">Question:</span> A verse supports Rav Chisda!</p></div>
<div class="indent1"><span class="nm">(e)</span><p><span class="cl">Version #1 (Rashi) Answer:</span> The Yisrael merely held the bucket of blood. The Kohen who would do Zerikah took it from him.</p></div>
<div class="indent1"><span class="nm">(f)</span><p><span class="cl">Version #2 (Aruch) Answer:</span> The Kohanim passed the buckets in a line. The Yisraelim did not take it. (end of Version #2)</p></div>
<div class="indent1"><span class="nm">(g)</span><p><span class="cl">(Rabah and Rav Yosef):</span> R. Shimon and Chachamim argue about whether Holachah of a Zar disqualifies.</p></div>
<div class="indent2"><span class="nm">1.</span><p>R. Shimon says that a dispensable Avodah is not considered Avodah, therefore, a Zar may do it;</p></div>
<div class="indent2"><span class="nm">2.</span><p><span class="cl">Version #1 (Rashi):</span> Chachamim say that because it is essential, if a Zar does it the Korban is Pasul.</p></div>
<div class="indent2"><span class="nm">3.</span><p><span class="cl">Version #2 (Tosfos):</span> Chachamim say that even though it is dispensable, if a Zar does it the Korban is Pasul. (end of Version #2)</p></div>
<div class="indent1"><span class="nm">(h)</span><p><span class="cl">Question (Abaye):</span> A Zar may do Shechitah, even though it is essential! (Rashi - according to Rabah and Rav Yosef, both Tana'im should require a Kohen; Tosfos - this challenges their explanation of R. Shimon).</p></div>
<div class="indent1"><span class="nm">(i)</span><p><span class="cl">Answer (Rabah and Rav Yosef):</span> Shechitah is not considered Avodah (Rashi - because anyone may do it; Tosfos - because it is required even for Chulin; alternatively - because the slaughterer may be anywhere (whereas one doing Avodah must be in the Azarah, and for Kodshei Kodoshim, he must be in the north half of the Azarah).</p></div>
<div class="indent1"><span class="nm">(j)</span><p><span class="cl">Question:</span> R. Zeira taught that if a Zar slaughtered the Parah Adumah (red heifer), it is Pasul!</p></div>
<div class="indent2"><span class="nm">1.</span><p><span class="cl">(Rav):</span> We learn that a Kohen must slaughter from "Elazar". We learn that this is Me'akev from "Chukah".</p></div>
<div class="indent1"><span class="nm">(k)</span><p><span class="cl">Answer #1:</span> (That is not because it is considered Avodah. Rather,) the Parah Adumah is different. It is Kodshim of Bedek ha'Bayis.</p></div>
<div class="indent1"><span class="nm">(l)</span><p><span class="cl">Question:</span> Regular Kodshim (i.e. that go on the Mizbeach) are more Kodesh. All the more so a Kohen is required!</p></div>
<div class="indent1"><span class="nm">(m)</span><p><span class="cl">Answer #2 (Rav Shisha brei d'Rav Idi):</span> Sometimes the Torah requires a Kohen for matters that are not Avodah, such as ruling about Tzara'as.</p></div>
<div class="indent1"><span class="nm">(n)</span><p><span class="cl">Question:</span> Bringing limbs (of an Olah) up the ramp (of the Mizbeach, to burn them) is a dispensable Avodah, yet a Zar may not do it!</p></div>
<div class="indent2"><span class="nm">1.</span><p>"V'Hikriv ha'Kohen (Es ha'Kol v'Hiktir ha'Mizbechah)" refers to bringing the limbs up the ramp!</p></div>
<div class="indent1"><span class="nm">(o)</span><p><span class="cl">Answer:</span> The Torah taught that a Kohen is needed for this. We do not learn to other places.</p></div>
<div class="indent1"><span class="nm">(p)</span><p><span class="cl">Question:</span> Bringing limbs up the ramp (and even burning them) is not Me'akev Kaparah, yet a Kohen must do it. All the more so a Kohen must bring blood to the Mizbe'ach, which is Me'akev Kaparah! (This is left difficult.)</p></div>
<div class="indent1"><span class="nm">(q)</span><p><span class="cl">(Ula):</span> If a Zar did Holachah, it is Pasul, even according to R. Shimon.</p></div>
<div class="subject"><span class="nm">4)</span><p><i>HOLACHAH</i> WITHOUT WALKING</p></div>
<div class="indent1"><span class="nm">(a)</span><p><span class="cl">Question:</span> Is Holachah without walking (i.e. extending with the hand) considered Holachah (if someone Pasul for Avodah did it, or if the Kohen had improper intent, does it disqualify the Korban? Also, according to Chachamim, does it fulfill the requirement for Holachah? (Rashi)</p></div>
<div class="indent1"><span class="nm">(b)</span><p><span class="cl">Answer #1 (Beraisa):</span> ...If Holachah (or Kabalah or Zerikah) was done sitting or with the left hand (it is Pasul).</p></div>
<div class="indent2"><span class="nm">1.</span><p><span class="cl">Inference:</span> If it was done standing still, it is Kosher (i.e. it is considered Holachah)!</p></div>
<div class="indent1"><span class="nm">(c)</span><p><span class="cl">Rejection:</span> Perhaps the Beraisa disqualifies shuffling along a bit while sitting, but if he was standing and moved his feet a bit, it is Kosher.</p></div>
<div class="indent1"><span class="nm">(d)</span><p><span class="cl">Answer #2 (Mishnah):</span> The Yisrael would slaughter (his Pesach), a Kohen did Kabalah, and Kohanim passed the bucket of blood one to another until the Mizbeach...</p></div>
<div class="indent1"><span class="nm">(e)</span><p><span class="cl">Rejection:</span> There also, perhaps each Kohen moved his feet a bit.</p></div>
<div class="indent2"><span class="nm">1.</span><p><span class="cl">Question:</span> If so, what is the Chidush?</p></div>
<div class="indent2"><span class="nm">2.</span><p><span class="cl">Answer:</span> It is better to involve many Kohanim - "b'Rav Am Hadras Melech".</p></div>
<div class="indent1"><span class="nm">(f)</span><p><span class="cl">Answer #3 (Mishnah):</span> If a Kosher Kohen did Kabalah and gave it to a Pasul (Kohen, or a Zar) he returns it to the Kosher Kohen. (The partial Holachah of extending it to the Pasul without walking is invalid. Therefore, the Kohen stands in the place he was when he gave it, takes it back, and repeats the Holachah with his feet!)</p></div>
<div class="indent1"><span class="nm">(g)</span><p><span class="cl">Rejection:</span> No, the Mishnah means that the Kosher Kohen takes it back (from the Pasul, closer to the Mizbe'ach than he was when he gave it to him, and continues the Holachah. The partial Holachah of extending it to the Pasul was valid.)</p></div>
