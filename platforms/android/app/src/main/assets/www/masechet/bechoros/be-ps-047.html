<div class="subject"><span class="nm">1)</span><p>CHILDREN BORN BEFORE AND AFTER CONVERSION</p></div>
<div class="indent1"><span class="nm">(a)</span><p><span class="cl">(R. Yochanan):</span> If a Nochri had children and then converted, the law of Bechor (to inherit a double portion) does not apply.</p></div>
<div class="indent1"><span class="nm">(b)</span><p><span class="cl">(Reish Lakish):</span> His firstborn (after converting) is a Bechor (for inheritance).</p></div>
<div class="indent2"><span class="nm">1.</span><p>R. Yochanan says that his firstborn (after converting) is not a Bechor because he is not "Reishis Ono" (his first biological child);</p></div>
<div class="indent2"><span class="nm">2.</span><p>Reish Lakish says that he is a Bechor. A convert is like a newborn baby. (It is as if he does not have previous children.)</p></div>
<div class="indent1"><span class="nm">(c)</span><p>R. Yochanan and Reish Lakish are consistent with what they taught elsewhere:</p></div>
<div class="indent2"><span class="nm">1.</span><p><span class="cl">(R. Yochanan):</span> If a Nochri had children and then converted, he already fulfilled "Peru u'Revu";</p></div>
<div class="indent2"><span class="nm">2.</span><p><span class="cl">(Reish Lakish):</span> He did not fulfill it.</p></div>
<div class="indent2"><span class="nm">3.</span><p>R. Yochanan says that he fulfilled it, for it is a Mitzvah even for Nochrim to have children - "Lo Sohu Vera'ah Lasheves Yetzarah";</p></div>
<div class="indent2"><span class="nm">4.</span><p>Reish Lakish says that he did not, for a convert is like a newborn baby (without previous children).</p></div>
<div class="indent1"><span class="nm">(d)</span><p>They must argue in both cases:</p></div>
<div class="indent2"><span class="nm">1.</span><p>Had they argued only here, one might have thought that Reish Lakish considers the first child (after conversion) a Bechor because inheritance of a double portion does not apply to Nochrim, but "Lasheves Yetzarah" applies. (He would agree that he fulfilled "Peru u'Revu");</p></div>
<div class="indent2"><span class="nm">2.</span><p>Had they argued only there, one might have thought that R. Yochanan says that he fulfilled "Peru u'Revu" because "Lasheves Yetzarah" applies to Nochrim, but not inheritance of a double portion. (He would agree that the next child is a Bechor.)</p></div>
<div class="indent1"><span class="nm">(e)</span><p><span class="cl">(Mishnah):</span> In the following cases, the next child will be a Bechor for inheritance, but not regarding Pidyon:</p></div>
<div class="indent2"><span class="nm">1.</span><p>A woman with children married a man without children;</p></div>
<div class="indent2"><span class="nm">2.</span><p>A Nochris or slave had children, then she converted or was freed.</p></div>
<div class="indent1"><span class="nm">(f)</span><p><span class="cl">Question:</span> Who fathered the first child after conversion or freedom?</p></div>
<div class="indent1"><span class="nm">(g)</span><p><span class="cl">Answer #1:</span> The father was a Yisrael without previous children.</p></div>
<div class="indent1"><span class="nm">(h)</span><p><span class="cl">Rejection:</span> If so, why does it say that she was a Nochris or slave? The same applies to a Bas Yisrael! (Her firstborn from her new husband is a Bechor only for inheritance.)</p></div>
<div class="indent1"><span class="nm">(i)</span><p><span class="cl">Answer #2:</span> The father was a convert with previous children (from when he was a Nochri).</p></div>
<div class="indent1"><span class="nm">(j)</span><p><span class="cl">Question:</span> The next child is a Bechor for inheritance. This refutes R. Yochanan!</p></div>
<div class="indent1"><span class="nm">(k)</span><p><span class="cl">Answer (and defense of Answer #1):</span> Really, the father was a Yisrael without previous children. The Chidush is that the next child is exempt from Pidyon;</p></div>
<div class="indent2"><span class="nm">1.</span><p>This is unlike R. Yosi ha'Gelili, who says that her next child is a Bechor even regarding Pidyon, for it says "Peter (Kol) Rechem bi'Venei Yisrael."</p></div>
<div class="indent1"><span class="nm">(l)</span><p><span class="cl">Question (against R. Yochanan - Beraisa):</span> If a Nochri had children then converted, his next child is a Bechor regarding inheritance.</p></div>
<div class="indent1"><span class="nm">(m)</span><p><span class="cl">Answer (Ravina):</span> The Tana is R. Yosi ha'Gelili, who learns Bechor (regarding Pidyon) from "Peter (Kol) Rechem bi'Vnei Yisrael";</p></div>
<div class="indent2"><span class="nm">1.</span><p>He learns Bechor regarding inheritance from Pidyon, i.e. it depends on his first child after becoming a Yisrael.</p></div>
<div class="subject"><span class="nm">2)</span><p>PETER RECHEM OF A LEVIYAH</p></div>
<div class="indent1"><span class="nm">(a)</span><p><span class="cl">(Rav Ada bar Ahavah):</span> The firstborn of a Leviyah is exempt from Pidyon.</p></div>
<div class="indent1"><span class="nm">(b)</span><p><span class="cl">Question:</span> Who is the father?</p></div>
<div class="indent2"><span class="nm">1.</span><p>It cannot be a Kohen or Levi. Their children are exempt, even from a Yisraelis!</p></div>
<div class="indent1"><span class="nm">(c)</span><p><span class="cl">Answer #1:</span> He is a Yisrael.</p></div>
<div class="indent1"><span class="nm">(d)</span><p><span class="cl">Rejection:</span> "L'Mishpechosam l'Veis Avosam" teaches that lineage follows the father!</p></div>
<div class="indent1"><span class="nm">(e)</span><p><span class="cl">Answer #2 (Rav Papa):</span> The father is a Nochri.</p></div>
<div class="indent2"><span class="nm">1.</span><p>This is not only according to the opinion that the child (of a Yisraelis from a Nochri) is not tainted (rather, he is attributed to his mother. Rashi - he is Kosher; Tosfos - he is a Mamzer, for Mamzerus applies to Yisrael);</p></div>
<div class="indent2"><span class="nm">2.</span><p>Rather, it is even like the opinion that the child is tainted (attributed to his father. Rashi - he is Pasul; Tosfos - he is not a Mamzer). He is a Pasul Levi.</p></div>
<div class="indent1"><span class="nm">(f)</span><p><span class="cl">Defense of Answer #1 (Mar brei d'Rav Yosef):</span> Really, the father is a Yisrael;</p></div>
<div class="indent2"><span class="nm">1.</span><p>Pidyon does not follow the usual law of lineage, for it depends on Peter Rechem, i.e. the mother.</p></div>
<div class="indent1"><span class="nm">(g)</span><p><span class="cl">(Mishnah):</span> (In the following cases, the next child will be a Bechor for Pidyon, but not for inheritance;)</p></div>
<div class="indent2"><span class="nm">1.</span><p>A man with children married a woman without children;</p></div>
<div class="indent2"><span class="nm">2.</span><p>A pregnant Nochris or slave (who had not yet given birth) converted or was freed.</p></div>
<div class="indent2"><span class="nm">3.</span><p>A woman gave birth for the first time, and the baby became mixed up with a baby of a Kohenes, Leviyah or a woman with previous children;</p></div>
<div class="indent2"><span class="nm">4.</span><p>A woman remarried within three months and gave birth within nine months, so we do not know if it is a nine-month baby from her first husband, or a seven-month baby from her new husband.</p></div>
<div class="indent1"><span class="nm">(h)</span><p><span class="cl">Inference:</span> From case (3), we learn that the child of a Kohenes or Leviyah is exempt from Pidyon.</p></div>
<div class="indent1"><span class="nm">(i)</span><p><span class="cl">Question:</span> Who is the father?</p></div>
<div class="indent2"><span class="nm">1.</span><p>It cannot be a Kohen or Levi. Their children are exempt, even from a Yisraelis!</p></div>
<div class="indent1"><span class="nm">(j)</span><p><span class="cl">Answer #1:</span> The father is a Nochri.</p></div>
<div class="indent1"><span class="nm">(k)</span><p><span class="cl">Objection:</span> Pidyon applies (regarding a Kohenes) if the father is a Nochri!</p></div>
<div class="indent2"><span class="nm">1.</span><p><span class="cl">Question (Rava):</span> If a Kohenes' first child was from a Nochri, does Pidyon apply?</p></div>
<div class="indent2"><span class="nm">2.</span><p><span class="cl">Answer #1 (Rav Papa):</span> This is like Rav Ada's law, that a Leviyah's child from a Nochri is exempt from Pidyon!</p></div>
<div class="indent2"><span class="nm">3.</span><p><span class="cl">Rejection (and Answer #2 - Rava):</span> No. A Leviyah's child is exempt, because she retains her Kedushah!</p></div>
<div class="indent3"><span class="nm">i.</span><p><span class="cl">(Beraisa):</span> (Even) if a Leviyah was captured (by Nochrim, so we suspect that they had relations with her) or was Mezanah (had extramarital relations with a Pasul who may not marry a Bas Yisrael), she may receive and eat Ma'aser (Rishon);</p></div>
<div class="indent2"><span class="nm">4.</span><p>A Kohenes is different. If she had relations with a Nochri or Pasul, she becomes like a Zar!</p></div>
<div class="indent1"><span class="nm">(l)</span><p><span class="cl">Answer #2:</span> Mar brei d'Rav Yosef can answer like he did above. The father is a Yisrael.</p></div>
<div class="indent1"><span class="nm">(m)</span><p><span class="cl">Question:</span> How can Rav Papa answer?</p></div>
<div class="indent1"><span class="nm">(n)</span><p><span class="cl">Answer #3:</span> Really, the father is a Kohen or Levi. The woman is called a Kohenes (or Leviyah) because her son is a Kohen (or Levi).</p></div>

<div class="subject"><span class="nm">3)</span><p>MUST A CHALAL REDEEM HIMSELF?</p></div>
<div class="indent1"><span class="nm">(a)</span><p><span class="cl">(Rav Chisda):</span> If a Kohen fathered a Chalal (someone born from a marriage forbidden only to Kohanim, e.g. a divorcee) and died, the son (if he is a Peter Rechem) must redeem himself.</p></div>
<div class="indent1"><span class="nm">(b)</span><p><span class="cl">(Rabah bar Rav Huna):</span> He need not redeem himself.</p></div>
<div class="indent1"><span class="nm">(c)</span><p>If the father died after 30 days, all agree that the son is exempt. It is as if the father redeemed him and kept the money himself;</p></div>
<div class="indent2"><span class="nm">1.</span><p>They argue in a case when the father died within 30 days.</p></div>
<div class="indent2"><span class="nm">2.</span><p>Rav Chisda obligates the son to redeem himself. Since the Mitzvah to redeem did not take effect in the father's lifetime, we cannot consider it as if he redeemed him and kept the money;</p></div>
<div class="indent2"><span class="nm">3.</span><p>Rabah exempts. (The son's obligation comes from his father's.) He can say 'since Kohanim could not have forced my father to pay, also I am exempt.'</p></div>
<div class="indent1"><span class="nm">(d)</span><p><span class="cl">Question (Mishnah):</span> If a pregnant Nochris converted, her son must be redeemed.</p></div>
<div class="indent2"><span class="nm">1.</span><p>Even though Kohanim could not have forced his father to pay, he is liable!</p></div>
<div class="indent1"><span class="nm">(e)</span><p><span class="cl">Answer:</span> The case of a Nochri (father) is different, for his son is not attributed to him. (There, the son's obligation does not depend on his father.)</p></div>
<div class="indent1"><span class="nm">(f)</span><p><span class="cl">(R. Shimon Ya'asinya):</span> If a Kohen fathered a Chalal and died within 30 days, the son must redeem himself. We do not consider it as if his father redeemed him and kept the money;</p></div>
<div class="indent2"><span class="nm">1.</span><p>If the father died after 30 days, the son is exempt. It is as if the father redeemed him and kept the money.</p></div>
<div class="indent1"><span class="nm">(g)</span><p><span class="cl">(Mishnah):</span> If a woman remarried within three months (the son is not a Bechor for inheritance).</p></div>
<div class="indent1"><span class="nm">(h)</span><p><span class="cl">Question:</span> This implies that he inherits like a regular son. The sons of either father should be able to say 'you do not inherit with us unless you prove that you are our brother!'</p></div>
<div class="indent1"><span class="nm">(i)</span><p><span class="cl">Answer (R. Yirmeyah):</span> Indeed, he does not inherit at all. The Mishnah teaches that he is a Bechor regarding Pidyon, and the <i>next</i> son is not a Bechor regarding inheritance.</p></div>
<div class="indent1"><span class="nm">(j)</span><p><span class="cl">Question:</span> He and the next son should be able to write a Harsha'ah (power of attorney) to each other! ("If I am the Bechor, I authorize my 'partner' to collect my extra portion." The 'partners' will divide the extra portion between themselves.)</p></div>
<div class="indent2"><span class="nm">1.</span><p><span class="cl">Suggestion:</span> The Mishnah does not discuss Harsha'ah.</p></div>
<div class="indent2"><span class="nm">2.</span><p><span class="cl">Rejection:</span> Later, we establish that the Mishnah discusses Harsha'ah!</p></div>
<div class="indent1"><span class="nm">(k)</span><p><span class="cl">Answer:</span> This supports R. Yanai:</p></div>
<div class="indent2"><span class="nm">1.</span><p><span class="cl">(R. Yanai):</span> (If the sons of two women became mixed up), if it was initially known which son is to which mother, the sons can write a Harsha'ah to each other. (Together, they inherit one share from each father);</p></div>
<div class="indent3"><span class="nm">i.</span><p>If it was never known which son is to which mother, they cannot write a Harsha'ah to each other.</p></div>
<div class="subject"><span class="nm">4)</span><p>MISCARRIAGES THAT DO NOT AFFECT BECHORAH</p></div>
<div class="indent1"><span class="nm">(a)</span><p>(Mishnah) The first child after any of the following (miscarriages) is a Bechor regarding inheritance and Pidyon:</p></div>
<div class="indent2"><span class="nm">1.</span><p>A Shefir (the outer skin of a fetus before bones form) full of water, blood or different colors (alternatively - of small, worm-like pieces);</p></div>
<div class="indent2"><span class="nm">2.</span><p>Forms of fish, Chagavim, Shekatzim u'Rmashim;</p></div>
<div class="indent2"><span class="nm">3.</span><p>A miscarriage within 40 days of conception.</p></div>
<div class="indent1"><span class="nm">(b)</span><p>A Yotzei Dofen is not a Bechor in either respect, nor is the child after it;</p></div>
<div class="indent1"><span class="nm">(c)</span><p>R. Shimon says, Yotzei Dofen is a Bechor for inheritance, but the child after it must be redeemed.</p></div>
<div class="indent1"><span class="nm">(d)</span><p><span class="cl">(Gemara):</span> (The first Tana holds that) Yotzei Dofen is not a Bechor for inheritance. "V'Yoldu Lo" teaches that the Bechor must be born normally (Rashi. Tosfos - we learn a Gezeirah Shavah "Leidah-Leidah" from Tum'as Leidah, which does not apply to Yotzei Dofen);</p></div>
<div class="indent2"><span class="nm">1.</span><p>It is not a Bechor for Pidyon, for it is not Peter Rechem;</p></div>
<div class="indent2"><span class="nm">2.</span><p>The next child is not a Bechor for inheritance, for it is not "Reishis Ono";</p></div>
<div class="indent2"><span class="nm">3.</span><p>It is not a Bechor for Pidyon. Even though it was the first to leave the womb, the Tana holds that a Bechor in one respect is not a Bechor (at all);</p></div>
<div class="indent2"><span class="nm">4.</span><p>R. Shimon says that Yotzei Dofen is a Bechor for inheritance. He expounds "Teled" to include Yotzei Dofen;</p></div>
<div class="indent2"><span class="nm">5.</span><p>The next child is a Bechor for Pidyon. He holds that a Bechor in one respect is a Bechor.</p></div>
