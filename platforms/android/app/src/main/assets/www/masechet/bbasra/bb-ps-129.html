<p class="bas subject"><span class="nm">1)</span>THE HALACHAH FOLLOWS R. ABA</p>
<p class="bas indent1"><span class="nm">(a)</span><span class="cl">Question:</span> For which teaching(s) was it necessary to teach that the Halachah follows R. Aba?</p>
<p class="bas indent2"><span class="nm">1.</span><span class="cl">Suggestion:</span> He must teach that the Halachah does not follow Rava (that Reuven's grandson can testify about Reuven's brother).</p>
<p class="bas indent2"><span class="nm">2.</span><span class="cl">Rejection:</span> R. Aba taught a smaller Chidush (that Reuven's grandson can testify about Reuven's nephew). We cannot infer that the Halachah does not follow Rava (perhaps R. Aba agrees with Rava)!</p>
<p class="bas indent2"><span class="nm">3.</span><span class="cl">Suggestion:</span> He must teach that the Halachah does not follow Mar bar Rav Ashi (that a man can testify about his grandfather).</p>
<p class="bas indent2"><span class="nm">4.</span><span class="cl">Rejection:</span> We already taught that explicitly!</p>
<p class="bas indent2"><span class="nm">5.</span><span class="cl">Suggestion:</span> He must teach that the Halachah does not follow Shmuel, Rav Sheshes and Rav Papa.</p>
<p class="bas indent2"><span class="nm">6.</span><span class="cl">Rejection:</span> They were already refuted!</p>
<p class="bas indent1"><span class="nm">(b)</span><span class="cl">Answer:</span> He teaches that the Halachah does not follow R. Yochanan (who ruled like Chachamim of R. Yehudah), and not like Mar bar Rav Ashi's objection (that even R. Shimon ben Elazar exempts from the oath in this case).</p>
<p class="bas subject"><span class="nm">2)</span>COMBINING EXPRESSIONS OF A GIFT AND INHERITANCE</p>
<p class="bas indent1"><span class="nm">(a)</span><span class="cl">(Mishnah):</span> If one (a Shechiv Mera) stipulated how much each son should receive, and gave some sons more than others...(If he wrote at the beginning, middle or end that it is a gift, it takes effect.)</p>
<p class="bas indent1"><span class="nm">(b)</span><span class="cl">Question:</span> What is the case of a gift at the beginning, middle or end?</p>
<p class="bas indent1"><span class="nm">(c)</span><span class="cl">Answer (Rav Dimi citing R. Yochanan):</span> At the beginning is when he said 'field Plonis will be given to Ploni and he will inherit it';</p>
<p class="bas indent2"><span class="nm">1.</span>In the end is when he said 'he will inherit it and it will be given to him;</p>
<p class="bas indent2"><span class="nm">2.</span>In the middle is when he said 'he will inherit it and it will be given to him and he will inherit it.</p>
<p class="bas indent2"><span class="nm">3.</span>This applies only to one field and one recipient. If there are two fields and one recipient, or one field and two recipients, the expression of a gift takes effect, and the expression of inheritance does not take effect.</p>
<p class="bas indent1"><span class="nm">(d)</span><span class="cl">(R. Elazar):</span> Even if there are two fields and one recipient, or one field and two recipients, both Kinyanim work;</p>
<p class="bas indent2"><span class="nm">1.</span>However, if there are two fields and two recipients, the expression of gift takes effect, and the expression of inheritance does not take effect.</p>
<p class="bas indent1"><span class="nm">(e)</span><span class="cl">(Ravin):</span> If he said 'field Plonis will be given to Ploni, Ploni will inherit field Plonis', R. Yochanan says that he acquires, and R. Elazar says that he does not.</p>
<p class="bas indent1"><span class="nm">(f)</span><span class="cl">(Abaye):</span> One of your teachings we understand. The other contradicts what Rav Dimi taught!</p>
<p class="bas indent2"><span class="nm">1.</span>You do not contradict R. Elazar. Your teach about two fields and two recipients, and R. Elazar teaches that the expression of inheritance does not acquire.</p>
<p class="bas indent2"><span class="nm">2.</span>We cannot resolve R. Yochanan!</p>
<p class="bas indent1"><span class="nm">(g)</span><span class="cl">Conclusion:</span> Rav Dimi and Ravin argue about R. Yochanan's opinion.</p>
<p class="bas indent1"><span class="nm">(h)</span><span class="cl">(Reish Lakish):</span> For both to acquire, he must say 'Ploni and Almoni will inherit fields Plonis and Almonis that I gave them for a gift, and they will inherit them.</p>
<p class="bas indent1"><span class="nm">(i)</span>Other Amora'im argue as R. Yochanan and R. Elazar argue.</p>
<p class="bas indent2"><span class="nm">1.</span><span class="cl">(Rav Hamnuna):</span> This applies only to one field and one recipient, but if there are two fields and one recipient, or one field and two recipients, the expression of inheritance does not take effect.</p>
<p class="bas indent2"><span class="nm">2.</span><span class="cl">(Rav Nachman):</span> Even if there are two fields and one recipient, or one field and two recipients, both Kinyanim work;</p>
<p class="bas indent3"><span class="nm">i.</span>However, if there are two fields and two recipients, the expression of inheritance does not take effect.</p>
<p class="bas indent2"><span class="nm">3.</span><span class="cl">(Rav Sheshes):</span> Even regarding two fields and two recipients, both take effect.</p>
<p class="bas indent1"><span class="nm">(j)</span><span class="cl">Support (Rav Sheshes for himself - Beraisa):</span> If Reuven said (before he left) 'give a Shekel (of my money) to my sons each week', and it is proper to give to them two Shekalim, we give to them two (he only intended that they should receive the minimum necessary);</p>
<p class="bas indent2"><span class="nm">1.</span>If he said 'give to them a Shekel', we give only one.</p>
<p class="bas indent2"><span class="nm">2.</span>If he said 'if they die, others (Ploni and Almoni) should inherit' (instead of their sons - this shows that he wants the rest of his money to go to the others), whether he said 'give' or 'give only', we give only one.</p>
<p class="bas bbbline">129b----------------------------------------129b</p>
<p class="bas indent2"><span class="nm">3.</span><span class="cl">Culmination of support:</span> This is like two fields (the weekly Shekalim and the remaining money) and two recipients (his sons and the others), and both acquire!</p>
<p class="bas indent1"><span class="nm">(k)</span><span class="cl">Rejection (Rav Sheshes):</span> This is not a proof. Perhaps the others could inherit Reuven, and the Beraisa is R. Yochanan ben Brokah (130a, who says that an expression of inheritance works).</p>
<p class="bas indent1"><span class="nm">(l)</span><span class="cl">Question (Rav Ashi - Beraisa):</span> If Reuven said 'my property is (given) to you (Shimon), and after you (die), Ploni will inherit, and after him, Almoni', after Shimon dies, Ploni acquires. After Ploni dies, Almoni acquires;</p>
<p class="bas indent2"><span class="nm">1.</span>If Ploni died before Shimon, when Shimon dies it goes to Shimon's heirs.</p>
<p class="bas indent2"><span class="nm">2.</span>This is like two fields (Rashbam - Ploni does not receive anything in Shimon's lifetime; R. Gershom - Shimon only received Peros of the land, but Ploni inherits the land itself) and two people, and both acquire!</p>
<p class="bas indent2"><span class="nm">3.</span><span class="cl">Suggestion:</span> Perhaps this is not a proof. Here also, Ploni could inherit Reuven, and the Beraisa is R. Yochanan ben Brokah!</p>
<p class="bas indent2"><span class="nm">4.</span><span class="cl">Rejection:</span> If so, Almoni would not acquire when Ploni dies!</p>
<p class="bas indent3"><span class="nm">i.</span><span class="cl">(Rav Acha brei d'Rav Avya):</span> According to R. Yochanan ben Brokah, if David said 'my property is to you (Shimon), and after you to Ploni', if Shimon could inherit David, Ploni does not get anything. 'To you' denotes an inheritance, and not a gift, and one cannot stipulate after inheritance.</p>
<p class="bas indent2"><span class="nm">5.</span>This refutes all the opinions (except for R. Yochanan according to Ravin, and Rav Sheshes).</p>
<p class="bas indent1"><span class="nm">(m)</span><span class="cl">Suggestion:</span> Reish Lakish is also refuted.</p>
<p class="bas indent1"><span class="nm">(n)</span><span class="cl">Rejection:</span> That cannot be. Rava said that the Halachah follows Reish Lakish against R. Yochanan in three places (and this is one of them)!</p>
<p class="bas indent2"><span class="nm">1.</span>Rather, in the Beraisa he said 'after you Ploni will inherit' Toch Kedei Dibur (within the time to say three or four words, therefore the first expression of a gift also applies to Ploni);</p>
<p class="bas indent2"><span class="nm">2.</span>Reish Lakish discusses when the inheritance was not said Toch Kedei Dibur of the gift, therefore it needs its own expression of a gift.</p>
<p class="bas indent1"><span class="nm">(o)</span>The Halachah is, anything said within Toch Kedei Dibur is like part of the previous matter, except for (Rashbam - designation for; Tosfos - acceptance of) idolatry, (blasphemy, divorce) and Kidushin.</p>
