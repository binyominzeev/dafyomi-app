<p class="bas subject"><span class="nm">1)</span>THE SALE OF YISRAEL</p>
<p class="bas indent1"><span class="nm">(a)</span><span class="cl">(R. Aba):</span> "The king said to Haman 'the money is given to you; do to the people as is good in your eyes". This is like two men; Ploni had a mound, and Almoni had a ditch.</p>
<p class="bas indent2"><span class="nm">1.</span><span class="cl">Almoni:</span> If only I could buy that mound (to fill in my ditch)!</p>
<p class="bas indent2"><span class="nm">2.</span><span class="cl">Ploni:</span> If only I could buy that ditch (to get rid of my mound)!</p>
<p class="bas indent2"><span class="nm">3.</span>When they met, Almoni asked to buy the mound. Ploni said 'if only you would take it (for free)!'</p>
<p class="bas indent1"><span class="nm">(b)</span><span class="cl">(R. Aba bar Kahana):</span> "The king took off his ring" - this was greater than the 55 Nevi'im that prophecized to Yisrael, for the Nevi'im did not succeed to make Yisrael do Teshuvah, whereas the removal of the ring made Yisrael do Teshuvah.</p>
<p class="bas indent1"><span class="nm">(c)</span><span class="cl">(Beraisa):</span> Fourty-eight male and seven female Nevi'im prophecized to Yisrael; they did not detract nor add to the Torah, except for Keri'as ha'Megilah.</p>
<p class="bas indent1"><span class="nm">(d)</span><span class="cl">Question:</span> What was their source?</p>
<p class="bas indent1"><span class="nm">(e)</span><span class="cl">Answer (R. Chiya bar Avin):</span> We sing Shirah (Hallel) for going from slavery to freedom (on Pesach), all the more so for going from death to life!</p>
<p class="bas indent1"><span class="nm">(f)</span><span class="cl">Question:</span> If so, we should also say Hallel (on Purim)!</p>
<p class="bas indent1"><span class="nm">(g)</span><span class="cl">Answer #1:</span> We do not say Hallel on a miracle in Chutz la'Aretz.</p>
<p class="bas indent2"><span class="nm">1.</span><span class="cl">Question:</span> Yetzi'as Miztrayim was in Chutz la'Aretz, and we say Shirah!</p>
<p class="bas indent2"><span class="nm">2.</span><span class="cl">Answer (Beraisa):</span> Before we entered Eretz Yisrael, all lands were fit to say Shirah (for a miracle done there). After we entered Eretz Yisrael, they were disqualified from Shirah.</p>
<p class="bas indent1"><span class="nm">(h)</span><span class="cl">Answer #2 (Rav Nachman):</span> Keri'as ha'Megilah is like Hallel.</p>
<p class="bas indent1"><span class="nm">(i)</span><span class="cl">Answer #3 (Rava):</span> Hallel begins with "Halelu Avdei Hash-m... " This is fitting for Yetzi'as Miztrayim, for we ceased to be slaves of Paro. Regarding Purim we did not become (exclusively) Avdei Hash-m; we remained subjects of Achashverosh!</p>
<p class="bas indent1"><span class="nm">(j)</span><span class="cl">Question:</span> The Beraisa refutes both Rava and Rav Nachman. After we entered Eretz Yisrael, other lands were disqualified from Shirah!</p>
<p class="bas indent1"><span class="nm">(k)</span><span class="cl">Answer:</span> Once we were exiled, they became Kosher again to say Shirah.</p>
<p class="bas subject"><span class="nm">2)</span>THE FIFTY-FIVE <i>NEVI'IM</i></p>
<p class="bas indent1"><span class="nm">(a)</span><span class="cl">Question:</span> There were more Nevi'im! "There was a man from <i>Ramasayim</i> Tzufim" - one of Ma'atayim (200) Tzufim (seers) who prophecized to Yisrael!</p>
<p class="bas indent1"><span class="nm">(b)</span><span class="cl">Answer:</span> There were many more; a Beraisa teaches that there were 1,200,000 Nevi'im. A prophecy thatwas needed for all generations was written (this applies to only 55 Nevi'im), one that was not needed for generations was not written.</p>
<p class="bas indent1"><span class="nm">(c)</span><span class="cl">(R. Shmuel bar Nachmani):</span> Ramasayim refers to two Ramos (hills) that are Tzofos (see) each other.</p>
<p class="bas indent1"><span class="nm">(d)</span><span class="cl">(R. Chanin):</span> It teaches that Elkanah descended from people who stand at the height of the world, i.e. Benei Korach - "U'Venei Korach Lo Mesu";</p>
<p class="bas indent2"><span class="nm">1.</span><span class="cl">(Beraisa - Rebbi):</span> A loft was made for them in Gehinom, and they stood upon it.</p>
<p class="bas subject"><span class="nm">3)</span>THE SEVEN FEMALE PROPHETS</p>
<p class="bas indent1"><span class="nm">(a)</span>There were seven Neviyos - Sarah, Miryam, Devorah, Chanah, Avigayil, Chuldah and Esther.</p>
<p class="bas indent1"><span class="nm">(b)</span>We learn about Sarah from "The father of Milkah and <i>Yiskah</i>";</p>
<p class="bas indent2"><span class="nm">1.</span><span class="cl">(R. Yitzchak):</span> This is Sarah. She is called Yiskah because she was Sochah (saw) with Ru'ach haKodesh - "Everything that she will say to you, listen to (the Ru'ach ha'Kodesh in) her voice."</p>
<p class="bas indent2"><span class="nm">2.</span>Also, she is called Yiskah because everyone was Socheh (gazed at) her beauty.</p>
<p class="bas indent1"><span class="nm">(c)</span>Regarding Miryam it says "Miryam ha'Nevi'yah Achos Aharon."</p>
<p class="bas indent2"><span class="nm">1.</span><span class="cl">Question:</span> Is she the sister of Aharon and not the sister of Moshe?!</p>
<p class="bas indent2"><span class="nm">2.</span><span class="cl">Answer (Rav):</span> She prophecized when she was only the sister of Aharon (before Moshe was born), and said 'my mother will have a child who will save Yisrael.'</p>
<p class="bas indent2"><span class="nm">3.</span>When Moshe was born, the house filled with light. Her father kissed her on her head, and said 'my daughter, your prophecy has been fulfilled!'</p>
<p class="bas indent2"><span class="nm">4.</span>When Moshe was thrown in the river, her father hit her on the head, and said to her, my daughter, what happened to your prophecy?!</p>
<p class="bas indent2"><span class="nm">5.</span>"His sister stood from afar, to know" - to know what will be the end of her prophecy.</p>
<p class="bas indent1"><span class="nm">(d)</span>Regarding Devorah it says "Devorah Ishah Neviyah".</p>
<p class="bas indent2"><span class="nm">1.</span>"Eshes <i>Lapidos</i>" - her husband used to make Pesilos (wicks) for the Mikdash.</p>
<p class="bas indent2"><span class="nm">2.</span><span class="cl">Question:</span> Why did she used to sit "under a palm tree"?</p>
<p class="bas indent2"><span class="nm">3.</span><span class="cl">Answer (R. Shimon ben Avshalom):</span> This was so she should not be secluded with a man. Alternatively, just like a palm tree has only one Lev (spine), so Yisrael in that generation had only one Lev (heart) to their Father in Heaven.</p>
<p class="bas indent1"><span class="nm">(e)</span>We learn about Chanah from "And Chanah prayed... my horn is raised in Hash-m" - my horn is raised, but not my flask;</p>
<p class="bas indent2"><span class="nm">1.</span>David and Shlomo were anointed with a horn (of oil), and their kingships lasted; Sha'ul and Yehu were anointed with flasks, and their kingships did not last.</p>
<p class="bas indent2"><span class="nm">2.</span><span class="cl">(Rav Yehudah bar Menasheh):</span> "Ein Kadosh ka'Shem Ki Ein Biltecha (besides You) - we read this Livlosecha (nothing endures longer than You).</p>
<p class="bas indent2"><span class="nm">3.</span>Hash-m's ways are unlike the ways of people. The works of people outlive them, but Hash-m outlives His works.</p>
<p class="bas indent2"><span class="nm">4.</span>"Ein Tzur (rock) kei'Lokeinu" - there is no Tzayar (artist) like Hash-m. A person draws a picture on a wall, and cannot put in it breath, a soul, innards or intestines. Hash-m draws a form within a form (a fetus in a mother), and puts in it breath, a soul, innards and intestines.</p>
<p class="bas indent1"><span class="nm">(f)</span>We learn about Avigayil from "She was riding on the donkey, and descended in the hidden part of the mountain.</p>
<p class="bas indent2"><span class="nm">1.</span><span class="cl">Question:</span> It should say 'she descended <i>from</i> the mountain!'</p>
<p class="bas indent2"><span class="nm">2.</span><span class="cl">Answer (Rabah bar Shmuel):</span> She came regarding blood, which comes from hidden (internal) places; she showed Dam Nidah to him (David).</p>
<p class="bas indent2"><span class="nm">3.</span><span class="cl">David:</span> Do we inspect blood at night?!</p>
<p class="bas indent2"><span class="nm">4.</span><span class="cl">Avigayil:</span> Do we judge capital cases (e.g. to kill Naval) at night?!</p>
<p class="bas bbbline">14b----------------------------------------14b</p>
<p class="bas indent2"><span class="nm">5.</span><span class="cl">David:</span> He rebelled against the king (me), so he need not be judged.</p>
<p class="bas indent2"><span class="nm">6.</span><span class="cl">Avigayil:</span> Sha'ul is still alive, and you are not known to be the king.</p>
<p class="bas indent2"><span class="nm">7.</span><span class="cl">David:</span> "You spared me today from coming in <i>Damim</i>" connotes two bloods (Nidah and killing Naval. He did not mention the Isur of Eshes Ish! Radvaz (7:29) - perhaps he thought that since Naval was Mored b'Malchus, is wife is permitted. (This is why Sha'ul gave David's wife to Palti ben Layish - Bereishis Rabah 32:1.) He prefers to say that Avigayil was merely Naval's Pilegesh.)</p>
<p class="bas indent2"><span class="nm">8.</span>She revealed her thigh, and David went three Parsa'os in its light. (Maharsha - she was three Parsa'os away from David at the time and was unaware of his presence. Iyun Yakov - it was an Aveirah Lishmah, she aroused David's desire in order that he would listen to her and not kill Naval.)</p>
<p class="bas indent2"><span class="nm">9.</span><span class="cl">David:</span> Consent to me (to have relations).</p>
<p class="bas indent2"><span class="nm">10.</span><span class="cl">Avigayil:</span> "<i>This</i> should not be a pitfall for you" implies that there will be a pitfall, i.e. Bas Sheva. (Tosfos  where?- this explains how she dissuaded him also from Dam Nidah after he desired relations with her. Maharsha - first we explained that he himself refrained from seeing Dam Nidah at night, and she dissuaded him from murder. The Gemara then gave an alternative explanation of 'Damim', that he desired relations with her, and she dissuaded him from two capital transgressions, i.e. Eshes Ish and murder.)</p>
<p class="bas indent2"><span class="nm">11..</span>When she left him, she said "You will remember your servant (and marry me after Naval dies)".</p>
<p class="bas indent2"><span class="nm">12.</span><span class="cl">(Rav Nachman):</span> This is like people say, at the same time that a woman talks, she weaves. Some say, a goose walks lowly, but its eyes look far ahead. (She was punished for desiring another man while her husband was alive, therefore her name is written missing a Yud (Shmuel 2:17:25) - Medrash Shmuel 23:12.)</p>
<p class="bas indent1"><span class="nm">(g)</span>Regarding Chuldah it says "Chilkiyah went... (to Chuldah ha'Neviyah)".</p>
<p class="bas indent2"><span class="nm">1.</span><span class="cl">Question:</span> How could she prophecize in Yirmeyahu's region?</p>
<p class="bas indent2"><span class="nm">2.</span><span class="cl">Answer (Rav):</span> She was his relative, so he did not mind.</p>
<p class="bas indent2"><span class="nm">3.</span><span class="cl">Question:</span> Why did Yoshiyah abandon Yirmeyahu and ask her?</p>
<p class="bas indent2"><span class="nm">4.</span><span class="cl">Answer #1 (R. Shilo):</span> This is because women are merciful.</p>
<p class="bas indent2"><span class="nm">5.</span><span class="cl">Answer #2 (R. Yochanan):</span> Yirmeyahu was not there, he had gone to return the 10 Shevatim.</p>
<p class="bas indent2"><span class="nm">6.</span><span class="cl">Question:</span> How do we know that they returned?</p>
<p class="bas indent2"><span class="nm">7.</span><span class="cl">Answer #1:</span> (Yovel applies only when "Kol Yoshveha" (all the Shevatim) are in Eretz Yisrael.) "The seller will not return to what he sells." If Yovel was Batel, the Navi would not prophecize that it will become Batel! Rather, we must say that Yovel was in force, for Yirmeyahu returned them. Yoshiyahu ben Amon ruled over them;</p>
<p class="bas indent3"><span class="nm">i.</span><span class="cl">Question:</span> "... These things that you did on the Mizbe'ach in Beis Kel" - what was Yoshiyahu (Melech Yehudah) doing on the Mizbe'ach in Beis Kel (in Malchus Yehudah)?</p>
<p class="bas indent3"><span class="nm">ii.</span><span class="cl">Answer:</span>  Rather, it teaches that Yoshiyahu ruled over the 10 Shevatim.</p>
<p class="bas indent2"><span class="nm">8.</span><span class="cl">Answer #2 (Rav Nachman):</span> We learn from "Gam Yehudah Shas Katzir Lach b'Shuvi Shevus Ami" (there is hope for the 10 Shevatim through Yoshiyahu Melech Yehudah).</p>
<p class="bas indent1"><span class="nm">(h)</span>We learn about Esther from "Va'Tilbash Esther <i>Malchus</i>";</p>
<p class="bas indent2"><span class="nm">1.</span><span class="cl">Question:</span> It should say '<i>Bigdei</i> Malchus'!</p>
<p class="bas indent2"><span class="nm">2.</span><span class="cl">Answer:</span> Rather, Ru'ach ha'Kodesh clothed her. It says here "Va'Tilbash", like it says "V'Ru'ach Lavshah Es Amasai."</p>
<p class="bas indent1"><span class="nm">(i)</span><span class="cl">(Rav Nachman):</span> Haughtiness (Rashi - importance) does not befit women. There were two such women, and (they acted haughtily even though) their names were loathed (creatures), i.e. a bee and a weasel.</p>
<p class="bas indent2"><span class="nm">1.</span>Regarding Devorah it says "She sent and called to Barak" - she did not go herself;</p>
<p class="bas indent2"><span class="nm">2.</span>Regarding Chuldah it says "Say to the man" - she didn't say, 'say to the king.'</p>
<p class="bas indent1"><span class="nm">(j)</span><span class="cl">Rav Nachman:</span> Chuldah descended from Yehoshua.</p>
<p class="bas indent2"><span class="nm">1.</span>It says regarding her (husband) "Ben Charchas", and it says about Yehoshua "B'Simnas Cheres."</p>
<p class="bas indent1"><span class="nm">(k)</span><span class="cl">Question (Beraisa - Rav Eina Sava):</span> Eight Nevi'im Kohanim descended from Rachav the harlot - Neriyah, Baruch, Serayah, Machsiyah, Yirmeyahu, Chilkiyah, Chanma'el and Shalom;</p>
<p class="bas indent2"><span class="nm">1.</span>R. Yehudah says, also Chuldah was from Rachav. It says regarding her "Ben Tikvah", like it says regarding Rachav "Tikvas (a thread) Chut ha'Shani". (If so, she was not from Yehoshua!)</p>
<p class="bas indent1"><span class="nm">(l)</span><span class="cl">Answer (Rav Nachman):</span> Together we will conclude the teaching. She converted, and Yehoshua married her.</p>
<p class="bas indent1"><span class="nm">(m)</span><span class="cl">Question:</span> Yehoshua did not have children! It says "Nun Beno Yehoshua Beno" (but no further)!</p>
<p class="bas indent1"><span class="nm">(n)</span><span class="cl">Answer:</span> He had no sons, but he had daughters.</p>
