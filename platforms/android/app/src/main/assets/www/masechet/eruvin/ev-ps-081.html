<div class="subject"><span class="nm">1)</span><p>FULL LOAVES ARE REQUIRED</p></div>
<div class="indent1"><span class="nm">(a)</span><p><span class="cl">(Gemara) Question:</span> We already learned this in another Mishnah!</p></div>
<div class="indent2"><span class="nm">1.</span><p><span class="cl">(Mishnah (26b)):</span> One may be Me'arev or Mishtatef with anything except for water and salt.</p></div>
<div class="indent1"><span class="nm">(b)</span><p><span class="cl">Answer #1 (Rabah):</span> Our Mishnah is needed to show that Chachamim argue with R. Yehoshua, who requires a loaf [for Eruvin of Chatzeros and Techumim (Tosfos). One might have thought that the above Mishnah discusses Eruv Techumim, but regarding Eruvei Chatzeros we are concerned for strife, if some residents contribute less important food than others, so we require bread].</p></div>
<div class="indent1"><span class="nm">(c)</span><p><span class="cl">Version #1 (our text, Rashi) Objection (Abaye - Beraisa):</span> One may make Eruvei Chatzeros or Shitufei Mavo'os with anything. Bread is required only for [Eruv of] a Chatzer;</p></div>
<div class="indent2"><span class="nm">1.</span><p>This is like R. Yehoshua, who requires bread for Eruvei Chatzeros, and the Reisha permits <i>anything</i> [for Chatzeros. This must mean <i>any kind of bread</i>. Perhaps also our Mishnah, which permits <i>anything</i> for Eruvei Chatzeros, refers to any kind of bread!]</p></div>
<div class="indent1"><span class="nm">(d)</span><p><span class="cl">Version #2 (Tosfos) Question (Abaye - Beraisa):</span> One may make Eruvei Techumim or Shitufei Mavo'os with anything. Bread is required only for Eruvei Chatzeros;</p></div>
<div class="indent2"><span class="nm">1.</span><p>This is like R. Yehoshua, who requires bread for Eruvei Chatzeros, and it permits anything for Eruv Techumim! (end of Version #2)</p></div>
<div class="indent1"><span class="nm">(e)</span><p><span class="cl">Answer #2 (Rabah bar bar Chanah):</span> Our Mishnah is needed to show that Chachamim argue with R. Yehoshua, who requires a full loaf.</p></div>
<div class="indent1"><span class="nm">(f)</span><p><span class="cl">Question:</span> Why does he require a full loaf?</p></div>
<div class="indent1"><span class="nm">(g)</span><p><span class="cl">Answer (R. Yosi ben Sha'ul):</span> This is due to strife. (Those who give full loaves might resent those who give pieces.)</p></div>
<div class="indent1"><span class="nm">(h)</span><p><span class="cl">Question (Rav Acha brei d'Rava):</span> If everyone gives a piece, is it permitted?</p></div>
<div class="indent1"><span class="nm">(i)</span><p><span class="cl">Answer (Rav Ashi):</span> No. We are concerned lest the old problem return. (Another time some will contribute full loaves, and there will be strife).</p></div>
<div class="indent1"><span class="nm">(j)</span><p><span class="cl">(R. Yochanan ben Sha'ul):</span> If one removed from a loaf the [minimal] Shi'ur for Dimu'a (one part in 50 or 100 - <a href=ev-ps-appendix.htm#28>see note 28 in Appendix</a>) or Chalah, it may be used.</p></div>
<div class="indent1"><span class="nm">(k)</span><p><span class="cl">Question (Beraisa):</span> If the amount for Dimu'a was removed, it may be used. If the amount for Chalah was removed, it may not be used.</p></div>
<div class="indent1"><span class="nm">(l)</span><p><span class="cl">Answer:</span> R. Yochanan permits a baker's Shi'ur of Chalah, and the Beraisa forbids a regular person's Shi'ur:</p></div>
<div class="indent2"><span class="nm">1.</span><p><span class="cl">(Mishnah):</span> The Shi'ur of Chalah [for a regular person] is one part in 24, whether it is for himself or his son's wedding feast;</p></div>
<div class="indent2"><span class="nm">2.</span><p>If a baker or woman makes bread to sell it, the Shi'ur is one part in 48.</p></div>
<div class="indent1"><span class="nm">(m)</span><p><span class="cl">(Rav Chisda):</span> If a loaf was Nifresah (Me'iri - sliced; Mishnah Berurah - a small slice was removed) and one connected the ends together using a chip, one may be Me'arev with it.</p></div>
<div class="indent1"><span class="nm">(n)</span><p><span class="cl">Question (Beraisa):</span> One may not be Me'arev with it.</p></div>
<div class="indent1"><span class="nm">(o)</span><p><span class="cl">Answer:</span> One may be Me'arev with it if it is not evident that it was Nifresah.</p></div>
<div class="subject"><span class="nm">2)</span><p>OTHER KINDS OF BREAD</p></div>
<div class="indent1"><span class="nm">(a)</span><p><span class="cl">(R. Zeira citing Shmuel):</span> One may be Me'arev with bread made from rice or millet.</p></div>
<div class="indent1"><span class="nm">(b)</span><p><span class="cl">(Mar Ukva citing Shmuel):</span> One may be Me'arev with rice bread, but not with millet bread.</p></div>
<div class="indent1"><span class="nm">(c)</span><p><span class="cl">(R. Chiya bar Avin):</span> One may be Me'arev with lentil bread.</p></div>
<div class="indent1"><span class="nm">(d)</span><p><span class="cl">Question:</span> Someone made such bread in the days of Shmuel. He fed it to a dog, and the dog did not eat it!</p></div>
<div class="indent1"><span class="nm">(e)</span><p><span class="cl">Answer:</span> That was made of many (Rashi; Me'iri - repulsive) ingredients;</p></div>
<div class="indent2"><span class="nm">1.</span><p>"Kach Lecha Chitim u'S'orim v'Dochan v'Chusmin..." (Rashi - bread of many ingredients is improper - "v'Lechem Anashim Lo Sochel" (24:17). Tosfos - it signified that there would be a siege, when starving people eat indecent food.)</p></div>
<div class="indent2"><span class="nm">2.</span><p><span class="cl">(Rav Papa):</span> It (Yechezkeil's bread) was roasted in human excrement - "v'Hi b'Gelelei Tze'as ha'Adam Te'ugenah."</p></div>
<div class="indent1"><span class="nm">(f)</span><p><span class="cl">Question:</span> Why does it say "v'Ugas Se'orim Tochlenah"? (It was not only of barley!)</p></div>
<div class="indent1"><span class="nm">(g)</span><p><span class="cl">Answer #1 (Rav Chisda):</span> We read "Se'orim" like 'Shi'urim.' (Eat it [sparingly] by measure);</p></div>
<div class="indent1"><span class="nm">(h)</span><p><span class="cl">Answer #2 (Rav Papa):</span> It should be kneaded in a trough (some texts - the loaves should be shaped in a way) appropriate for barley, and not [as nice as] for wheat.</p></div>
<div class="subject"><span class="nm">3)</span><p>PAYING ONE TO BE ME'AREV FOR HIM</p></div>
<div class="indent1"><span class="nm">(a)</span><p><span class="cl">(Mishnah - R. Eliezer):</span> One may give money to a grocer or baker [who lives in the same Mavoy] to acquire [wine or bread] for [Shituf or] Eruv;</p></div>
<div class="indent1"><span class="nm">(b)</span><p>Chachamim say, the money does not acquire for him. (The seller thinks that the buyer acquired the food, but he did not. The buyer did not intend to make the seller a Shali'ach to be Me'arev with his own food);</p></div>
<div class="bbbline">81b----------------------------------------81b</p></div>
<div class="indent2"><span class="nm">1.</span><p>Chachamim agree that one may give money to anyone else to acquire for him. (He makes him a Shali'ach to be Me'arev for him.)</p></div>
<div class="indent1"><span class="nm">(c)</span><p>[It does not work regarding a baker [or grocer] because] one cannot be Me'arev for another without his Da'as.</p></div>
<div class="indent1"><span class="nm">(d)</span><p>R. Yehudah says, this applies only to Eruv Techumim, but one may make Eruv Chatzeros for someone even without his Da'as;</p></div>
<div class="indent2"><span class="nm">1.</span><p>This is because Zachin l'Adam she'Lo b'Fanav, v'Ein Chavin l'Adam she'Lo b'Fanav. (When a person is not here, one may do for him Zechus (something intrinsically advantageous), but not Chov (something with a detrimental side).)</p></div>
<div class="indent1"><span class="nm">(e)</span><p><span class="cl">(Gemara) Question:</span> What is R. Eliezer's reason? He did not do Meshichah (bring the food to his property. Money does not acquire!)</p></div>
<div class="indent1"><span class="nm">(f)</span><p><span class="cl">Answer (Rav Nachman):</span> R. Eliezer makes this like four times during the year (when money acquires, like R. Yochanan will explain):</p></div>
<div class="indent2"><span class="nm">1.</span><p><span class="cl">(Mishnah):</span> There are four times (Erev Simchas Torah, Erev Pesach, Erev Shavu'os, Erev Rosh Hashanah) when one who paid for meat from an animal [to be slaughtered] can force the butcher to slaughter it, even if the animal is expensive and only a small amount of the meat was sold;</p></div>
<div class="indent3"><span class="nm">i.</span><p>Therefore, if the animal dies, the buyer loses what he paid [since he acquired part of the animal].</p></div>
<div class="indent2"><span class="nm">2.</span><p>At other times, one cannot force the butcher to slaughter it. Therefore, if the animal dies, the butcher suffers the loss himself. (The animal still belongs to him.)</p></div>
<div class="indent2"><span class="nm">3.</span><p><span class="cl">Question:</span> The buyer only gave money. How did he acquire part of the animal without Meshichah?</p></div>
<div class="indent2"><span class="nm">4.</span><p><span class="cl">Answer #1 (Rav Huna):</span> The case is, he did Meshichah.</p></div>
<div class="indent2"><span class="nm">5.</span><p><span class="cl">Objection:</span> If so, at all times we should force the butcher to slaughter, and the buyer loses if the animal died!</p></div>
<div class="indent2"><span class="nm">6.</span><p><span class="cl">Answer #2 (Rav Shmuel bar R. Yitzchak):</span> Really, the buyer did not do Meshichah. Rather, someone else acquired on his behalf (he was not asked to do so);</p></div>
<div class="indent3"><span class="nm">i.</span><p>At the four times (everyone eats beef), it is a Zechus to buy, therefore someone else can Zocheh for him she'Lo b'Fanav;</p></div>
<div class="indent3"><span class="nm">ii.</span><p>At other times, it is a Chov, and Ein Chavin l'Adam she'Lo b'Fanav.</p></div>
<div class="indent2"><span class="nm">7.</span><p><span class="cl">Answer #3 (R. Yochanan):</span> At these four times, [regarding meat] Chachamim leave in force the Torah law that money acquires:</p></div>
<div class="indent3"><span class="nm">i.</span><p><span class="cl">(R. Yochanan):</span> Mid'Oraisa, money acquires Metaltelim. Chachamim enacted that Meshichah works [and not money], lest [a fire erupt in the seller's premises] and the seller will [not toil to save what he sold because he will not suffer the loss, for he can] tell the buyer '<i>your</i> wheat burned.'</p></div>
<div class="indent1"><span class="nm">(g)</span><p><span class="cl">(Mishnah):</span> Chachamim agree that one may give money to anyone else...</p></div>
<div class="indent1"><span class="nm">(h)</span><p><span class="cl">Question:</span> Who is considered 'anyone else'?</p></div>
<div class="indent1"><span class="nm">(i)</span><p><span class="cl">Answer (Rav):</span> It is a Ba'al ha'Bayis. (He does not normally sell bread or wine.)</p></div>
<div class="indent1"><span class="nm">(j)</span><p>Shmuel agrees with Rav;</p></div>
<div class="indent2"><span class="nm">1.</span><p><span class="cl">(Shmuel):</span> The Mishnah applies only to a baker, but [if one gave money to] a Ba'al ha'Bayis [he] acquires for him.</p></div>
<div class="indent1"><span class="nm">(k)</span><p><span class="cl">(Shmuel):</span> The Mishnah applies only when he gave money [to acquire], but if he acquired using a Kli (Chalifin), the Eruv is valid.</p></div>
<div class="indent1"><span class="nm">(l)</span><p><span class="cl">(Shmuel):</span> The Mishnah applies if he said 'acquire for me.' If he said 'be Me'arev for me', he made him a Shali'ach, so it is valid.</p></div>
<div class="subject"><span class="nm">4)</span><p>DO CHACHAMIM ARGUE WITH REBBI YEHUDAH?</p></div>
<div class="indent1"><span class="nm">(a)</span><p><span class="cl">(Mishnah - R. Yehudah):</span> This applies [only to Eruv Techumim, but not to Eruv Chatzeros].</p></div>
<div class="indent1"><span class="nm">(b)</span><p><span class="cl">(Rav Yehudah):</span> The Halachah follows R. Yehudah. In fact, the Halachah always follows R. Yehudah in Eruvin.</p></div>
<div class="indent1"><span class="nm">(c)</span><p><span class="cl">Question (Rav Chana Bagdata'ah):</span> Does this apply even regarding a Korah of a Mavoy that fell down [on Shabbos? R. Yehudah permits the entire Shabbos.]</p></div>
<div class="indent1"><span class="nm">(d)</span><p><span class="cl">Answer (Rav Yehudah):</span> No. The rule applies only to [validity of] Eruvin, but not to Mechitzos.</p></div>
<div class="indent1"><span class="nm">(e)</span><p><span class="cl">Question (Rav Acha brei d'Rava):</span> 'The Halachah follows R. Yehudah' implies that Chachamim argue with him. R. Yehoshua ben Levi taught that whenever R. Yehudah says in a Mishnah 'when is this?' or 'what is the case?', he does not argue, rather, he explains the first Tana!</p></div>
<div class="indent2"><span class="nm">1.</span><p><span class="cl">Question (against R. Yehoshua ben Levi):</span> They do argue!</p></div>
<div class="indent3"><span class="nm">i.</span><p><span class="cl">(Mishnah):</span> If new residents joined the Chatzer, one must add and be Mezakeh more food. He must inform them.</p></div>
<div class="indent2"><span class="nm">2.</span><p><span class="cl">Answer:</span> That refers to a Chatzer between two Mavo'os.</p></div>
<div class="indent1"><span class="nm">(f)</span><p><span class="cl">Question:</span> Rav Shizbi said 'this teaches that Chachamim argue with R. Yehudah'!</p></div>
<div class="indent1"><span class="nm">(g)</span><p><span class="cl">Answer (Rav Ashi):</span> Rav Yehudah is an Amora, just like R. Yehoshua ben Levi. He can argue with him. (R. Yehoshua ben Levi holds that Chachamim agree with R. Yehudah. Rav Yehudah disagrees [and so does Rav Shizbi].)</p></div>
