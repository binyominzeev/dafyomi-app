<p class="bas subject"><span class="nm">1)</span>LIABILITY FOR KIDNAPPING</p>
<p class="bas indent1"><span class="nm">(a)</span><span class="cl">(A reciter of Beraisos - R. Shimon):</span> "Me'Echav" teaches that he must remove him from his brother's premises. He is exempt for selling to relatives!</p>
<p class="bas indent1"><span class="nm">(b)</span><span class="cl">(Rav Sheshes):</span> Indeed, Beraisa #2 should say that he is exempt for selling to relatives.</p>
<p class="bas indent1"><span class="nm">(c)</span><span class="cl">Question:</span> Why change the Beraisa? Perhaps it is like Chachamim who argue with R. Shimon!</p>
<p class="bas indent1"><span class="nm">(d)</span><span class="cl">Answer:</span> The Beraisa is part of Sifri (which expounds verses in Bamdbar and Devarim). We may assume that it is like R. Shimon;</p>
<p class="bas indent2"><span class="nm">1.</span><span class="cl">(R. Yochanan):</span> A Stam Mishnah is assumed to be R. Meir;</p>
<p class="bas indent2"><span class="nm">2.</span>A Stam Tosefta is assumed to be R. Nechemyah;</p>
<p class="bas indent2"><span class="nm">3.</span>A Stam Sifra (i.e. Toras Kohanim, which expounds verses in Vayikra) is assumed to be R. Yehudah;</p>
<p class="bas indent2"><span class="nm">4.</span>A Stam Sifri is assumed to be R. Shimon;</p>
<p class="bas indent2"><span class="nm">5.</span>All of these are assumed to be according to R. Akiva (all of these were his Talmidim).</p>
<p class="bas indent1"><span class="nm">(e)</span><span class="cl">(Mishnah):</span> If one kidnaps his son...</p>
<p class="bas indent1"><span class="nm">(f)</span><span class="cl">Question:</span> What is Chachamim's reason (to exempt)?</p>
<p class="bas indent1"><span class="nm">(g)</span><span class="cl">Answer (Abaye):</span> "Ki Yimatzei" excludes one who is normally found by the kidnapper (e.g. his son).</p>
<p class="bas indent1"><span class="nm">(h)</span><span class="cl">Question (Rav Papa):</span> If so, does "Ki Yimatzei Ish Shochev Im Ishah Be'ulas Ba'al" exclude the house of Ploni (a certain house) in which men and women cohabit?</p>
<p class="bas indent1"><span class="nm">(i)</span><span class="cl">Answer (Abaye):</span> I learn from "v'Nimtza b'Yado."</p>
<p class="bas indent1"><span class="nm">(j)</span><span class="cl">(Rava):</span> Children and Talmidim are normally by their Rebbi, therefore he would be exempt for kidnapping them.</p>
<p class="bas indent1"><span class="nm">(k)</span><span class="cl">(Mishnah):</span> If one kidnaps a half-slave...</p>
<p class="bas indent1"><span class="nm">(l)</span><span class="cl">(Mishnah - R. Yehudah):</span> Embarrassment does not apply to slaves.</p>
<p class="bas indent1"><span class="nm">(m)</span><span class="cl">Question:</span> What is R. Yehudah's reason?</p>
<p class="bas indent1"><span class="nm">(n)</span><span class="cl">Answer:</span> "Ki Yinatzu... Ish v'Achiv" refers to people who have (Halachic) brothers. It excludes slaves.</p>
<p class="bas indent2"><span class="nm">1.</span>Chachamim disagree. Since also a slave is commanded to keep Mitzvos, he is called a brother of a Yisrael.</p>
<p class="bas indent1"><span class="nm">(o)</span><span class="cl">Question:</span> What is R. Yehudah's source to obligate for kidnapping a half-slave?</p>
<p class="bas indent1"><span class="nm">(p)</span><span class="cl">Answer:</span> "Me'Echav" excludes a slave. "Bnei Yisrael" excludes a half-slave. Also "<i>mi</i>'Bnei Yisrael" excludes a half-slave;</p>
<p class="bas indent2"><span class="nm">1.</span>Two exclusions, one after the other, always come to include.</p>
<p class="bas indent1"><span class="nm">(q)</span>Chachamim say, "me'Echav" does not exclude a slave, for he is a brother in Mitzvos;</p>
<p class="bas indent2"><span class="nm">1.</span>"Bnei Yisrael" excludes a slave, and "mi'Bnei Yisrael" excludes a half-slave.</p>
<p class="bas subject"><span class="nm">2)</span>THE WARNING NOT TO KIDNAP</p>
<p class="bas indent1"><span class="nm">(a)</span><span class="cl">Question:</span> Which verse forbids kidnapping?</p>
<p class="bas indent1"><span class="nm">(b)</span><span class="cl">Answer #1 (R. Yoshiyah):</span> It is "Lo Signov (in the 10 utterances)."</p>
<p class="bas indent1"><span class="nm">(c)</span><span class="cl">Answer #2 (R. Yonason):</span> It is "Lo Yimachru Mimkeres Aved."</p>
<p class="bas indent2"><span class="nm">1.</span>They do not argue. R. Yoshiyah gives the Lav not to kidnap, and R. Yonason gives the Lav not to sell.</p>
<p class="bas indent1"><span class="nm">(d)</span><span class="cl">(Beraisa #1):</span> "Lo Signov" forbids kidnapping.</p>
<p class="bas indent2"><span class="nm">1.</span><span class="cl">Question:</span> Perhaps it forbids stealing money!</p>
<p class="bas indent2"><span class="nm">2.</span><span class="cl">Answer:</span> One of (R. Yishmael's) 13 methods of expounding is to learn from the context. The previous Mitzvos (murder and adultery) are Chayavei Misos, so presumably "Lo Signov" is also.</p>
<p class="bas indent1"><span class="nm">(e)</span><span class="cl">(Beraisa #2):</span> "Lo Tignovu (in Parshas Kedoshim)" forbids stealing money.</p>
<p class="bas indent2"><span class="nm">1.</span><span class="cl">Question:</span> Perhaps it forbids kidnapping!</p>
<p class="bas indent2"><span class="nm">2.</span><span class="cl">Answer:</span> One of the 13 methods of expounding is to learn from the context. The verse is followed by monetary laws.</p>
<p class="bas subject"><span class="nm">3)</span>TESTIMONY ABOUT A <i>CHATZI-DAVAR</i></p>
<p class="bas indent1"><span class="nm">(a)</span><span class="cl">(Chizkiyah):</span> If two witnesses testified that Reuven kidnapped, and two others testified that he sold, and all were Huzmu, they are not killed (therefore, the testimony is Iy Efshar Lehazimo. Even if they are not Huzmu, Reuven is not killed);</p>
<p class="bas indent1"><span class="nm">(b)</span><span class="cl">(R. Yochanan):</span> They are killed.</p>
<p class="bas indent2"><span class="nm">1.</span>Chizkiyah holds like R. Akiva, who says that testimony must be a (full) Davar (matter), and not a half-Davar;</p>
<p class="bas indent2"><span class="nm">2.</span>R. Yochanan holds like Chachamim, who say that testimony can even be a half-Davar.</p>
<p class="bas indent1"><span class="nm">(c)</span>Chizkiyah admits that if witnesses who testified about the second time a Ben Sorer u'Moreh stole and ate (for which he is killed) were Huzmu, they are killed;</p>
<p class="bas bbbline">86b----------------------------------------86b</p>
<p class="bas indent2"><span class="nm">1.</span>Since the witnesses who testified about the first theft suffice to lash him, also the testimony of the latter witnesses is considered a (full) 'Davar.'</p>
<p class="bas indent1"><span class="nm">(d)</span><span class="cl">Question (Rav Papa):</span> If so, Chizkiyah should admit also about kidnapping! Since the witnesses who testify about the kidnapping suffice to lash him, also the testimony about the sale is a 'Davar'!</p>
<p class="bas indent2"><span class="nm">1.</span><span class="cl">Suggestion:</span> Perhaps Chizkiyah holds that one is not lashed for kidnapping (without selling).</p>
<p class="bas indent2"><span class="nm">2.</span><span class="cl">Rejection:</span> Chizkiyah and R. Yochanan argued whether or not Edim Zomemim who testified about kidnapping are lashed;</p>
<p class="bas indent3"><span class="nm">i.</span>We concluded that Chizkiyah must say that they are lashed. According to R. Yochanan, they <i>could</i> be killed (if witnesses will testify that he sold, and all will be Huzmu after the final verdict) for Lo Sa'aneh, which forbids false testimony);</p>
<p class="bas indent3"><span class="nm">ii.</span>One (in this case, a witness) is not lashed for a Lav that can obligate Misah!</p>
<p class="bas indent1"><span class="nm">(e)</span><span class="cl">(Rav Papa):</span> Rather, all agree that witnesses of the sale are killed (if they are Huzmu after the final verdict). They argue about witnesses of the kidnapping:</p>
<p class="bas indent2"><span class="nm">1.</span>Chizkiyah says that they are not killed. Kidnapping is considered an independent matter. It is not a transgression of Misah;</p>
<p class="bas indent2"><span class="nm">2.</span>R. Yochanan says that they are killed. Kidnapping is the first half of the transgression (which culminates with the sale).</p>
<p class="bas indent1"><span class="nm">(f)</span>R. Yochanan admits that if witnesses who testify about the first time a Ben Sorer u'Moreh stole were Huzmu, they are not killed, for they can say that they only intended to lash him.</p>
<p class="bas indent1"><span class="nm">(g)</span><span class="cl">(Abaye):</span> All agree about Ben Sorer u'Moreh (sometimes, the witnesses are exempt), all agree about Ben Sorer u'Moreh (sometimes, the witnesses are liable), and they argue about (liability of the witnesses in a third scenario of) Ben Sorer u'Moreh:</p>
<p class="bas indent2"><span class="nm">1.</span>All agree that the first witnesses (who testify about the first time he stole and ate) are not killed, for they can say that they intended only to lash him;</p>
<p class="bas indent2"><span class="nm">2.</span>All agree that the latter witnesses (who testify about the second time he stole and ate) are killed, for the first witnesses can say that they intended only to lash him, so the Chiyuv Misah is totally due to the latter witnesses;</p>
<p class="bas indent2"><span class="nm">3.</span>The argument about Ben Sorer u'Moreh is when two witnesses say that they saw him steal the second time, and two others say that they saw him eat the second time. (Chidushei ha'Ran - Chizkiyah holds like R. Akiva, who says that the testimony of the theft is invalid, for it is a half-Davar, for it does not obligate even lashes without the latter testimony. It does not obligate money, for it is considered part of capital testimony. R. Yochanan holds like Chachamim, who accept the testimony.)</p>
<p class="bas indent1"><span class="nm">(h)</span><span class="cl">(Rav Asi):</span> If witnesses testify that Reuven sold someone (and they were Huzmu), they are exempt, for he can say that he sold his slave.</p>
<p class="bas indent1"><span class="nm">(i)</span><span class="cl">(Rav Yosef):</span> This is like R. Akiva, who invalidates testimony about a half-Davar.</p>
<p class="bas indent1"><span class="nm">(j)</span><span class="cl">Rejection (Abaye):</span> Rav Asi said that they are exempt because he can say that he sold his slave. Chachamim agree with this. The case is, there are no witnesses that he kidnapped.</p>
<p class="bas indent1"><span class="nm">(k)</span><span class="cl">Question:</span> If so, obviously they are exempt!</p>
<p class="bas indent1"><span class="nm">(l)</span><span class="cl">Answer:</span> The case is, witnesses of kidnapping came later (and Reuven was convicted, and later the witnesses were Huzmu).</p>
<p class="bas indent1"><span class="nm">(m)</span><span class="cl">Question:</span> Still, it is obvious that they are exempt, for when they testified, there were no witnesses of kidnapping!</p>
<p class="bas indent1"><span class="nm">(n)</span><span class="cl">Answer:</span> The case is, the witnesses gestured to each other;</p>
<p class="bas indent2"><span class="nm">1.</span>One might have thought that this shows that they collaborated with each other (and the witnesses of the sale are also liable). Rav Asi teaches that this is not so.</p>
<p class="bas subject"><span class="nm">4)</span>ZAKEN MAMREI</p>
<p class="bas indent1"><span class="nm">(a)</span><span class="cl">(Mishnah):</span> Zaken Mamrei is one who rebels against the Great Sanhedrin - "Ki Yipalei... (v'Alisa El ha'Makom... v'El ha'Shofet)." The verse discusses three Sanhedriyos;</p>
<p class="bas indent2"><span class="nm">1.</span>One sits at the entrance to Har ha'Bayis, one sits at the entrance to the Azarah, and one sits in Lishkas ha'Gazis.</p>
<p class="bas indent1"><span class="nm">(b)</span>If a Chacham opposed the Beis Din of his city, they go to the Sanhedrin at the entrance to Har ha'Bayis. He says 'this is how I expounded. This is how they expounded. This is how I learned. This is how they learned.' If the Sanhedrin has a tradition for the law, they give it. If not, they go to the Sanhedrin at the entrance to the Azarah.</p>
<p class="bas indent1"><span class="nm">(c)</span>If also this Sanhedrin has no tradition, they all go to the Great Sanhedrin in Lishkas ha'Gazis which teaches Torah to Yisrael - "Min ha'Makom Asher Yivchar Hash-m." (The Great Sanhedrin rules on the issue.)</p>
<p class="bas indent1"><span class="nm">(d)</span>If the Chacham returns to his city and learns as he did before, he is exempt. If he rules (for others to follow in practice) he is liable. "Asher <i>Ya'aseh</i> v'Zadon" shows that he is liable only if he teaches for others to follow.</p>
<p class="bas indent1"><span class="nm">(e)</span>If a Talmid (not qualified to rule) rules for others to follow, he is exempt;</p>
<p class="bas indent2"><span class="nm">1.</span>His disqualification exempts him.</p>
