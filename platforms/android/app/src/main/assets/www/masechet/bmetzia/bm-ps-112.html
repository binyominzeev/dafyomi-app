<p class="bas subject"><span class="nm">1)</span>THE PUNISHMENT FOR WITHHOLDING WAGES</p>
<p class="bas indent1"><span class="nm">(a)</span><span class="cl">(Rav Asi):</span> Even if a worker was hired only to pick one cluster of grapes, one who withholds his wages transgresses "Lo Salin". The first Tana learns from "v'Elav Hu Nosei Es Nafsho" (anything he obligated himself to do).</p>
<p class="bas indent1"><span class="nm">(b)</span>R. Yosi b'Rebbi Yehudah expounds this verse as follows.</p>
<p class="bas indent2"><span class="nm">1.</span><span class="cl">(Beraisa):</span> "V'Elav Hu Nosei Es Nafsho" - a worker risks his life, going up high ramps and trees for his wages;</p>
<p class="bas indent2"><span class="nm">2.</span>Anyone who withholds wages is like one who takes his life.</p>
<p class="bas indent1"><span class="nm">(c)</span><span class="cl">(Rav Huna or Rav Chisda):</span> This refers to the employer's life (he causes his own death).</p>
<p class="bas indent1"><span class="nm">(d)</span><span class="cl">(The other of Rav Huna and Rav Chisda):</span> This refers to the worker's life.</p>
<p class="bas indent2"><span class="nm">1.</span>The first opinion learns from "Al Tigzal Dal... v'Kova Es Koveihem Nafesh";</p>
<p class="bas indent2"><span class="nm">2.</span>The second opinion learns from "Es Nefesh Be'alav Yikach".</p>
<p class="bas indent2"><span class="nm">3.</span><span class="cl">Question:</span> How does the first opinion expound the second verse?</p>
<p class="bas indent2"><span class="nm">4.</span><span class="cl">Answer:</span> The verse refers to the thief. After taking the money, he is called "Be'alav (the owner)".</p>
<p class="bas indent2"><span class="nm">5.</span><span class="cl">Question:</span> How does the second opinion expound the first verse?</p>
<p class="bas indent2"><span class="nm">6.</span><span class="cl">Answer:</span> The employer is worthy of death because he mortally afflicts the worker.</p>
<p class="bas subject"><span class="nm">2)</span>OTHER CONDITIONS FOR TRANSGRESSING</p>
<p class="bas indent1"><span class="nm">(a)</span><span class="cl">(Mishnah):</span> If the worker did not ask for his wages, the employer does not transgress.</p>
<p class="bas indent1"><span class="nm">(b)</span><span class="cl">(Beraisa) Suggestion:</span> Perhaps "Lo Salin Pe'ulas Sachir Itecha Ad Boker" is even if the worker did not ask for his wages;</p>
<p class="bas indent2"><span class="nm">1.</span>"Itecha" (you choose to have his money), i.e. you transgress only if he asked for his wages.</p>
<p class="bas indent2"><span class="nm">2.</span><span class="cl">Suggestion:</span> Perhaps he transgresses even if he gave them to a grocer or moneychanger!</p>
<p class="bas indent2"><span class="nm">3.</span><span class="cl">Rejection:</span> "Itecha" - with you, not with a grocer or moneychanger.</p>
<p class="bas indent1"><span class="nm">(c)</span><span class="cl">(Mishnah):</span> He does not transgress if he arranged with a grocer or moneychanger to pay the worker (and the employer will reimburse him).</p>
<p class="bas indent1"><span class="nm">(d)</span><span class="cl">Question:</span> If the grocer or moneychanger refuses to pay the worker, can he claim from his employer?</p>
<p class="bas indent1"><span class="nm">(e)</span><span class="cl">(Rav Sheshes):</span> He cannot claim from his employer;</p>
<p class="bas indent1"><span class="nm">(f)</span><span class="cl">(Rabah):</span> He can claim from his employer.</p>
<p class="bas indent2"><span class="nm">1.</span>Rabah deduces this from the Mishnah. The employer does not transgress if he arranged with a grocer or moneychanger, but he is liable to pay;</p>
<p class="bas indent2"><span class="nm">2.</span>Rav Sheshes explains, it is irrelevant to discuss transgressing, because he is exempt from paying.</p>
<p class="bas indent1"><span class="nm">(g)</span><span class="cl">Question:</span> Does one transgress "Lo Salin" for withholding wages of a Kablan (one hired to complete a task for a fixed price)?</p>
<p class="bas indent2"><span class="nm">1.</span>If we say that a craftsman (immediately) acquires the improvements he makes on a Kli, then wages are not due to him, this is merely a loan (the employer owes him for the improvements on the Kli);</p>
<p class="bas indent2"><span class="nm">2.</span>If we say that a craftsman does not acquire improvements on a Kli, then wages are due (and the employer transgresses).</p>
<p class="bas indent1"><span class="nm">(h)</span><span class="cl">Answer (Rav Sheshes):</span> He transgresses.</p>
<p class="bas indent1"><span class="nm">(i)</span><span class="cl">Question (Beraisa):</span> He does not transgress.</p>
<p class="bas indent1"><span class="nm">(j)</span><span class="cl">Answer:</span> That is when he gave the money to a grocer or moneychanger.</p>
<p class="bas indent1"><span class="nm">(k)</span><span class="cl">Support (Beraisa):</span> If Reuven gave his garment to a craftsman (Levi), who finished it and informed Reuven, even if Reuven does not come for 10 days (to take and pay for it), he does not transgress keeping a worker's wages overnight;</p>
<p class="bas indent2"><span class="nm">1.</span>If Levi returned the garment during the day, if Reuven does not pay before sundown, he transgresses.</p>
<p class="bas indent2"><span class="nm">2.</span>If a craftsman acquires ownership in a Kli that he improves, why does Reuven transgress? (Levi acquired the garment, and sold it to Reuven. Reuven does not owe wages, rather, for a sale!)</p>
<p class="bas indent1"><span class="nm">(l)</span><span class="cl">Rejection #1 (Rav Mari brei d'Rav Kahana):</span> The Beraisa discusses one hired to teasel cloth (there is no improvement, for it lasts better if not teaseled).</p>
<p class="bas indent1"><span class="nm">(m)</span><span class="cl">Question:</span> If so, why did he hire him?</p>
<p class="bas indent1"><span class="nm">(n)</span><span class="cl">Answer:</span> He hired him to soften it.</p>
<p class="bas indent1"><span class="nm">(o)</span><span class="cl">Objection:</span> That is an improvement!</p>
<p class="bas indent1"><span class="nm">(p)</span><span class="cl">Rejection #2:</span> Rather, he was hired to stomp on it (to clean and moisten it), he is paid for each hit (he is not a Kablan).</p>

<p class="bas subject"><span class="nm">3)</span>WHY THE WORKER SWEARS</p>
<p class="bas indent1"><span class="nm">(a)</span><span class="cl">(Mishnah):</span> At the time a worker should be paid, he swears and collects (this is a Rabbinical enactment).</p>
<p class="bas indent1"><span class="nm">(b)</span><span class="cl">Question:</span> Why did Chachamim enact that he swears and collects?</p>
<p class="bas indent1"><span class="nm">(c)</span><span class="cl">Answer #1 (Rav Nachman):</span> Mid'Oraisa, the employer should swear and be exempt; like every case of one who denies a debt;</p>
<p class="bas indent2"><span class="nm">1.</span>Chachamim enacted that the worker swears and collects for the sake of his livelihood.</p>
<p class="bas indent2"><span class="nm">2.</span><span class="cl">Question:</span> Is that a proper reason to take money from the employer?!</p>
<p class="bas indent2"><span class="nm">3.</span><span class="cl">Answer:</span> The enactment benefits the employer. It encourages people to work for others.</p>
<p class="bas indent3"><span class="nm">i.</span><span class="cl">Question:</span> The worker would prefer that the employer swears and is exempt, to encourage him to hire workers!</p>
<p class="bas indent3"><span class="nm">ii.</span><span class="cl">Answer:</span> No. An employer must hire people in any case.</p>
<p class="bas indent2"><span class="nm">4.</span><span class="cl">Objection:</span> Also workers must work for others in any case!</p>
<p class="bas indent1"><span class="nm">(d)</span><span class="cl">Answer #2:</span> Rather, an employer is busy overseeing his workers. Presumably he forgot that he did not pay.</p>
<p class="bas indent1"><span class="nm">(e)</span><span class="cl">Question #1:</span> If so, the worker should collect without swearing!</p>
<p class="bas indent1"><span class="nm">(f)</span><span class="cl">Answer:</span> The oath is to appease the employer (lest he suspect that the worker is lying).</p>
<p class="bas indent2"><span class="nm">1.</span><span class="cl">Question:</span> Chachamim should have enacted that he must pay the worker in front of witnesses!</p>
<p class="bas indent2"><span class="nm">2.</span><span class="cl">Answer:</span> That is too tedious.</p>
<p class="bas indent2"><span class="nm">3.</span><span class="cl">Question:</span> Chachamim should have enacted that workers are paid before they work (so they will not be believed later).</p>
<p class="bas indent2"><span class="nm">4.</span><span class="cl">Answer:</span> Everyone prefers that workers are paid after working (sometimes the employer does not have money to pay them beforehand; the workers are afraid that they will lose the money).</p>
<p class="bas indent1"><span class="nm">(g)</span><span class="cl">Question #2:</span> If so (the enactment is because an employer is busy), the same should apply even if they argue about the (amount of the) wages!</p>
<p class="bas indent2"><span class="nm">1.</span><span class="cl">(Beraisa):</span> If the worker says 'you hired me for two', and the employer says 'I hired you for one', (for the worker) to take money from another (the employer), he must bring proof.</p>
<p class="bas indent1"><span class="nm">(h)</span><span class="cl">Answer:</span> People surely remember the agreed wages.</p>
<p class="bas indent1"><span class="nm">(i)</span><span class="cl">Question #3:</span> If so, the same should apply after the time to be paid!</p>
<p class="bas indent2"><span class="nm">1.</span><span class="cl">(Mishnah):</span> After the time he should be paid, he does not swear and collect.</p>
<p class="bas indent1"><span class="nm">(j)</span><span class="cl">Answer:</span> There is a Chazakah that an employer will not transgress "Lo Salin."</p>
<p class="bas indent1"><span class="nm">(k)</span><span class="cl">Question:</span> We said that an employer is busy, and he forgets!</p>
<p class="bas indent1"><span class="nm">(l)</span><span class="cl">Answer:</span> That is before the deadline for payment comes. When it comes, he motivates himself and remembers.</p>
