<p class="dedicationbox"><br>PAST DEDICATION<br>BAVA KAMA 36-37 - Two weeks of study material have been dedicated by Mrs. Estanne Abraham Fawer to honor the ninth Yahrzeit of her father, Rav Mordechai ben Eliezer Zvi (Rabbi Morton Weiner) Z'L, who passed away on 18 Teves 5760. May the merit of supporting and advancing Dafyomi study -- which was so important to him -- during the weeks of his Yahrzeit serve as an Iluy for his Neshamah. </p>

<p class="bas indent1"><span class="nm">(a)</span><span class="cl">(Mishnah):</span> An ox that is Mu'ad to gore oxen (and it) is not Mu'ad to gore other animals (Amora'im argue about whether or not the text of the Mishnah includes the words in parentheses);</p>

<p class="bas indent1"><span class="nm">(e)</span><span class="cl">(Gemara - Rav Zvid):</span> The Mishnah says 'an ox that is Mu'ad to gore oxen, and it is not Mu'ad for other animals...'</p>

<p class="bas indent1"><span class="nm">(g)</span>Rav Zvid learned from the Seifa. An ox that is Mu'ad for small animals (and it) is not Mu'ad for big animals.</p>
<p class="bas indent2"><span class="nm">1.</span>Granted, if the text is 'and it is not Mu'ad', this teaches that an ox Mu'ad for small animals is assumed to be Mu'ad for big animals.</p>
<p class="bas indent2"><span class="nm">2.</span>But if the text is 'is not Mu'ad', the Chidush would be that an ox Mu'ad for small animals is not assumed to be Mu'ad for big animals. The Reisha already taught a bigger Chidush (that Mu'ad for small animals of its species is not Mu'ad for small animals of another species)!</p>
<p class="bas indent2"><span class="nm">3.</span>Rav Papa says that we could not learn from the Reisha. One might have thought that once it starts goring a species, it does not distinguish between big and small animals of the species. The Seifa teaches that this is not so.</p>
<p class="bas indent1"><span class="nm">(h)</span>Rav Papa learned from the Reisha. An ox that is Mu'ad for people is not Mu'ad for animals.</p>
<p class="bas indent2"><span class="nm">1.</span>Granted, if the text is 'is not Mu'ad', this teaches that an ox Mu'ad for people is assumed not to be Mu'ad for animals (even though animals lack Mazel, and it is easier to gore them).</p>
<p class="bas indent2"><span class="nm">2.</span>But if the text is 'and it is not Mu'ad', the Chidush would be that an ox Mu'ad for people is assumed to be Mu'ad for animals. The previous clause already taught a bigger Chidush (Mu'ad for animals of one (even its own) species is Mu'ad for animals of another species)!</p>
<p class="bas indent2"><span class="nm">3.</span>Rav Zvid says that the clause is needed to teach about returning to the status of Tam. I.e., it was Mu'ad for people and for animals, and it stopped being Mu'ad for animals (three times, it refrained from goring them). One might have thought that since it remains Mu'ad for man, it is not considered Tam for animals. The Seifa teaches that this is not so.</p>
<p class="bas indent1"><span class="nm">(i)</span><span class="cl">Question (against Rav Zvid - Beraisa - Sumchus):</span> A Kal va'Chomer teaches that an ox Mu'ad for people is Mu'ad for animals.</p>
<p class="bas indent2"><span class="nm">1.</span>If it is Mu'ad to gore man, all the more so to gore animals!</p>
<p class="bas indent2"><span class="nm">2.</span>This implies that the Chachamim who argue with him hold that Mu'ad to gore man is not Mu'ad for animals (and our Mishnah is like Chachamim)!</p>
<p class="bas indent1"><span class="nm">(j)</span><span class="cl">Answer:</span> The Beraisa discusses returning to the status of Tam. The first Tana holds that it reverts to being Tam for animals, even though it remains Mu'ad for man. Sumchus holds that a Kal va'Chomer teaches that it remains Mu'ad for animals!</p>
<p class="bas indent2"><span class="nm">1.</span>If it remains Mu'ad for man, all the more so for animals!</p>

<p class="bas indent3"><span class="nm">i.</span>Since the Chidush of the Mishnah is the inference, it proceeds to explain it, how much it pays for each (even though this is no Chidush).</p>
<p class="bas indent2"><span class="nm">2.</span><span class="cl">Question:</span> But if the text is 'is not Mu'ad', this is the Chidush. Why does the Mishnah continue to teach that a Mu'ad pays full damage, and a Tam pays half-damage? We already know this!</p>

<p class="bas subject"><span class="nm">4)</span>DAMAGE TO <i>HEKDESH</i> ANIMALS</p>
<p class="bas indent1"><span class="nm">(a)</span><span class="cl">(Mishnah):</span> If a Yisrael's ox gored a Hekdesh ox or vice-versa, it is exempt. One is liable for "Shor Re'ehu (the ox of his fellowman)", not the ox of Hekdesh.</p>

<p class="bas indent2"><span class="nm">1.</span><span class="cl">(Beraisa):</span> If a Yisrael's ox gored a Hekdesh ox or vice-versa, it is exempt - "Shor Re'ehu", not the ox of Hekdesh;</p>

<p class="bas indent2"><span class="nm">1.</span>If "Shor Re'ehu" is a condition to be liable, a Yisrael's ox that gored a Hekdesh ox should be exempt!</p>
<p class="bas indent2"><span class="nm">2.</span>If "Shor Re'ehu" merely discusses a typical case, but the Torah obligates even when it is not his fellowman's ox, a Hekdesh ox that gored should also be liable!</p>

<p class="bas indent3"><span class="nm">i.</span>A Yisrael's ox is liable for goring a Yisrael's ox, and all the more so for goring a Hekdesh ox!</p>
<p class="bas indent2"><span class="nm">4.</span><span class="cl">Rejection:</span> If so, we could not learn more than the source, i.e. half-damage for a Tam, due to Dayo!</p>
<p class="bas indent1"><span class="nm">(e)</span><span class="cl">Answer (Reish Lakish):</span> The Torah obligated full damage (for Mu'ad);, all animals were included. It taught that a Tam pays half-damage only regarding "Shor Re'ehu";</p>
<p class="bas indent2"><span class="nm">1.</span>It did not teach this for goring a Hekdesh ox, so it pays full damage.</p>
<p class="bas indent2"><span class="nm">2.</span>Had the Torah come to exempt for goring a Hekdesh ox, it would have written "Shor Re'ehu" regarding a Mu'ad!</p>
