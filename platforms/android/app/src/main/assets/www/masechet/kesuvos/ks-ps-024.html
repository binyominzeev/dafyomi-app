<p class="bas subject"><span class="nm">1)</span>WHAT WE LEARN FROM EACH <i>MISHNAH</i></p>
<p class="bas indent1"><span class="nm">(a)</span>Had we only learned the Mishnah (15b) in which R. Yehoshua admits (that we believe one who says 'this field was your father's and I bought it from him'), one might have thought that there the one who forbids can permit, because he stands to lose money (Tosfos - he is Muchzak ; Rashi  - if he was not sure, he would not have admitted);</p>
<p class="bas indent2"><span class="nm">1.</span>This would not apply to witnesses (18b, who say 'these are our signatures, but we were invalid witnesses at the time') since <i>they</i> do not stand to lose money.</p>
<p class="bas indent1"><span class="nm">(b)</span>Had we taught only about witnesses, one might have thought that we believe them because <i>they</i> will not gain from lying, but we do not believe one who helps himself;</p>
<p class="bas indent1"><span class="nm">(c)</span>Had we taught only these two Mishnayos, one might have thought that they are believed only regarding money, but not regarding Isurim, such as a married woman (who claims that she was divorced - 22a).</p>
<p class="bas indent1"><span class="nm">(d)</span><span class="cl">Question:</span> Why must we teach (22a) 'I was captured but I am Tehorah'?</p>
<p class="bas indent1"><span class="nm">(e)</span><span class="cl">Answer #1:</span> We need to teach that if witnesses come after they were (permitted to be) married, they do not leave (the permission).</p>
<p class="bas indent1"><span class="nm">(f)</span><span class="cl">Question:</span> This is like Rabah bar Avin (23a), who says that this clause applies only to a captive;</p>
<p class="bas indent2"><span class="nm">1.</span>R. Oshaya holds that this clause applies also to one who claims that she was divorced. How can he answer?</p>
<p class="bas indent1"><span class="nm">(g)</span><span class="cl">Answer #2:</span> We need to teach the case of two women who were captured (23b).</p>
<p class="bas indent1"><span class="nm">(h)</span><span class="cl">Question:</span> Why do we need this case?</p>
<p class="bas indent1"><span class="nm">(i)</span><span class="cl">Answer:</span> One might have thought that we should suspect that they are conspiring to falsely testify to help each other. The Mishnah teaches that this is not so.</p>
<p class="bas indent1"><span class="nm">(j)</span><span class="cl">Question:</span> Why do we need the case of two men (our Mishnah)?</p>
<p class="bas indent1"><span class="nm">(k)</span><span class="cl">Answer:</span> We need to teach the argument of R. Yehudah and Chachamim.</p>
<p class="bas subject"><span class="nm">2)</span>THE CONCERN LEST TWO SCHEME TO HELP EACH OTHER</p>
<p class="bas indent1"><span class="nm">(a)</span><span class="cl">(Beraisa):</span> If Reuven said 'I am a Kohen, and so is David', we rely on him to let David eat Terumah, but not regarding lineage (for David to marry);</p>
<p class="bas indent1"><span class="nm">(b)</span>If a third man is with them, and each Kohen has two others testifying that he is a Kohen, this establishes them to have proper lineage;</p>
<p class="bas indent1"><span class="nm">(c)</span>R. Yehudah says, even regarding Terumah Reuven is not believed unless there is a third man.</p>
<p class="bas indent1"><span class="nm">(d)</span><span class="cl">Question:</span> This shows that R. Yehudah is concerned lest two lie to help each other, and Chachamim are not concerned for this. Elsewhere, they hold contrary to this!</p>
<p class="bas indent2"><span class="nm">1.</span><span class="cl">(Mishnah):</span> If two merchants (Levi and Shimon) entered a city, and Levi said 'my produce is new and my friend's is old. Mine is Tevel and my friend's is tithed', he is not believed;</p>
<p class="bas indent2"><span class="nm">2.</span>R. Yehudah says, he is believed.</p>
<p class="bas indent1"><span class="nm">(e)</span><span class="cl">Answer #1 (Rav Ada bar Ahavah):</span> The opinions (in the Beraisa) must be switched.</p>
<p class="bas indent1"><span class="nm">(f)</span><span class="cl">Answer #2 (Abaye):</span> R. Yehudah is lenient regarding Demai (doubtfully tithed produce), because most people tithe.</p>
<p class="bas indent1"><span class="nm">(g)</span><span class="cl">Question (Rava):</span> We must also resolve the contradiction in Chachamim!</p>
<p class="bas indent1"><span class="nm">(h)</span><span class="cl">Answer #3 (Rava):</span> We resolve R. Yehudah like Abaye did. We resolve Chachamim like Rav Chama bar Ukva answered (a different question), 'he is holding tools of the trade'.</p>
<p class="bas bbbline">24b----------------------------------------24b</p>
<p class="bas indent2"><span class="nm">1.</span>Here also, when he is holding tools of the trade we are concerned that he is lying to help his friend. (Levi will not sell his produce by degrading it. Perhaps they conspire, and in another city Shimon will degrade his own produce and praise Levi's!)</p>
<p class="bas indent1"><span class="nm">(i)</span>Rav Chama answered the following question:</p>
<p class="bas indent2"><span class="nm">1.</span><span class="cl">(Mishnah):</span> If a potter (who is careful about Taharah) left his pots and went to drink, the inner ones are Tehorim and the outer ones are Temei'im.</p>
<p class="bas indent2"><span class="nm">2.</span><span class="cl">Contradiction (Beraisa #1):</span> Both of them are Temei'im.</p>
<p class="bas indent2"><span class="nm">3.</span><span class="cl">Answer (R. Chama bar Ukva):</span> (The Beraisa discusses when) he has his tools of the trade, so everyone touches the pots (since they know that they are for sale).</p>
<p class="bas indent2"><span class="nm">4.</span><span class="cl">Contradiction (Beraisa #2):</span> Both are Tehorim.</p>
<p class="bas indent2"><span class="nm">5.</span><span class="cl">Answer (R. Chama bar Ukva):</span> (This is when) he does not have his tools of the trade.</p>
<p class="bas indent2"><span class="nm">6.</span><span class="cl">Question:</span> The Mishnah says that only the outer pots are Temei'im. What is the case?</p>
<p class="bas indent2"><span class="nm">7.</span><span class="cl">Answer:</span> The pots are close to a major road with obstacles to distance wagons from the walls on the sides. (Clothing of ignoramuses is Tamei, and it touches or enters the airspace of outer pots near the obstacles.)</p>
<p class="bas indent1"><span class="nm">(j)</span><span class="cl">Answer #4:</span> R. Yehudah and Chachamim argue about whether or not we establish a person to have proper lineage based on seeing him eat Terumah. (R. Yehudah says that we do, so he always requires two witnesses to establish a person to be a Kohen to eat Terumah. However,. in a case where one witness suffices, he is not concerned lest two conspire to testify falsely for each other.)</p>
<p class="bas subject"><span class="nm">3)</span>WHAT ESTABLISHES A PERSON TO HAVE PROPER LINEAGE?</p>
<p class="bas indent1"><span class="nm">(a)</span><span class="cl">Question:</span> Can we establish that a person has proper lineage based on a document?</p>
<p class="bas indent2"><span class="nm">1.</span><span class="cl">Question:</span> What is the case?</p>
<p class="bas indent3"><span class="nm">i.</span>If it says, 'I, Ploni the Kohen, sign as a witness', no one testifies about him!</p>
<p class="bas indent2"><span class="nm">2.</span><span class="cl">Answer:</span> Rather, it says 'I, Ploni the Kohen borrowed... ', and witnesses signed below.</p>
<p class="bas indent2"><span class="nm">3.</span>Do witnesses testify only about the loan, or about everything in the document?</p>
<p class="bas indent1"><span class="nm">(b)</span><span class="cl">Answer:</span> Rav Huna and Rav Chisda argued. One said that documents establish lineage, and the other said that they do not.</p>
<p class="bas indent1"><span class="nm">(c)</span><span class="cl">Question:</span> If we see a man Duchan (bless Birkas Kohanim), does this establish him to have proper lineage?</p>
<p class="bas indent2"><span class="nm">1.</span>This does not depend on whether or not we establish lineage based on eating Terumah.</p>
<p class="bas indent2"><span class="nm">2.</span>Perhaps the one who establishes based on eating does so because a Zar (non-Kohen) who eats Terumah is liable to death at the hands of Shamayim (so surely he must be a proper Kohen). For a Zar to Duchan is only an Isur inferred from an Aseh, perhaps he would agree that it is not a proof of proper lineage. Or, perhaps we do not distinguish;</p>
<p class="bas indent2"><span class="nm">3.</span>Perhaps the other opinion does <i>not</i> establish based on eating because Terumah is eaten in private. Birkas Kohanim is done in public, so a Zar would not be so brazen to Duchan, so it is a proof. Or, perhaps we do not distinguish.</p>
<p class="bas indent1"><span class="nm">(d)</span><span class="cl">Answer:</span> Rav Chisda and R. Avina argued. One said that Birkas Kohanim establishes lineage, and the other said that it does not.</p>
<p class="bas indent1"><span class="nm">(e)</span><span class="cl">Question (Rav Nachman bar Yitzchak):</span> May we establish lineage based on Birkas Kohanim?</p>
<p class="bas indent1"><span class="nm">(f)</span><span class="cl">Answer (Rava):</span> Rav Chisda and R. Avina argued about this.</p>
<p class="bas indent1"><span class="nm">(g)</span><span class="cl">Question (Rav Nachman bar Yitzchak):</span> What is the final ruling?</p>
<p class="bas indent1"><span class="nm">(h)</span><span class="cl">Answer #1 (Rava):</span> I know a Beraisa (which says that we do not).</p>
<p class="bas indent2"><span class="nm">1.</span><span class="cl">(Beraisa - R. Yosi):</span> Chazakah is great! "Among the Kohanim... they could not find their documents of lineage, and were spurned from Kehunah. Ha'Tirshasa told them that they will not eat Kodshei Kodoshim (Korbanos permitted only to Kohanim) until (Mashi'ach will come and) a Kohen (Gadol) will wear the Urim v'Tumim (to rule about them)";</p>
<p class="bas indent3"><span class="nm">i.</span>He said that they keep their Chazakah. Just like they ate Terumah in Bavel, they may eat Terumah in Eretz Yisrael. (Likewise, they may continue to Duchan.)</p>
<p class="bas indent2"><span class="nm">2.</span>If we establish lineage based on Birkas Kohanim, people would come to approve of the lineage of these disqualified Kohanim!</p>
<p class="bas indent1"><span class="nm">(i)</span><span class="cl">Objection (Rav Nachman bar Yitzchak):</span> There it is different, since people see a weakness in their Chazakah (they may not eat Kodshei Kodoshim).</p>
<p class="bas indent1"><span class="nm">(j)</span><span class="cl">Support (for Objection):</span> If we would not say so, how would the opinion that establishes lineage from eating Terumah address this concern?!</p>
