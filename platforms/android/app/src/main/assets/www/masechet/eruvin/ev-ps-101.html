<div class="indent1"><span class="nm">(a)</span><p><span class="cl">(Mishnah):</span> One may not close [an opening] with the following unless they are [held] above the ground [even when open. This shows that they are already fixed in the wall, so closing them is not building]:</p></div>
<div class="indent2"><span class="nm">1.</span><p>A door to Rachbah (a Chatzer in back of houses), bundles of thorns used to seal a breach in a wall, and a [reed] mattress.</p></div>
<div class="indent1"><span class="nm">(b)</span><p><span class="cl">(Gemara) Contradiction (Beraisa):</span> If a door, mattress or Kankan (a Kli held behind a plow that can serve as a door) drags on the ground, one may close with it on Shabbos, and all the more so on Yom Tov, if it is tied and hanging [from the doorway].</p></div>
<div class="indent1"><span class="nm">(c)</span><p><span class="cl">Resolution #1 (Abaye):</span> In the Beraisa, the door [or mattress...] has a hinge pin. (Even if it drags on the ground, it is clearly a door, so it does not look like building.)</p></div>
<div class="indent1"><span class="nm">(d)</span><p><span class="cl">Resolution #2 (Rava):</span> In the Beraisa, it once had a hinge pin. (Even if it no longer has one, there is a Heker that it was a door.)</p></div>
<div class="indent1"><span class="nm">(e)</span><p><span class="cl">Question (against both of them - Beraisa):</span> If a door, mattress or Kankan (R. Chananel - has a hinge pin and) drags on the ground, one may close with it only if it is tied and suspended above the ground, even a hair's width. If not, one may not. (We adopt R. Chananel's text. According to our text, the Beraisa is just like the Mishnah, so it is not clear what the question is. Tosfos - they could have replied that the Beraisa contradicts itself. The Reisha says that they drag on the ground!)</p></div>
<div class="indent1"><span class="nm">(f)</span><p><span class="cl">Answer #1 (Abaye, for himself):</span> It must have a hinge pin <i>or</i> be suspended above the ground.</p></div>
<div class="indent1"><span class="nm">(g)</span><p><span class="cl">Answer #2 (Rava, for himself):</span> It must have <i>once had</i> a hinge pin, <i>or</i> be suspended above the ground.</p></div>
<div class="indent1"><span class="nm">(h)</span><p><span class="cl">(Beraisa):</span> If branches of thorn-bushes or bundles [of wood] were prepared to seal a breach in a Chatzer:</p></div>
<div class="indent2"><span class="nm">1.</span><p>If they are tied and suspended one may close with them on Shabbos, and there is no need to say it is permitted on Yom Tov.</p></div>
<div class="indent1"><span class="nm">(i)</span><p><span class="cl">(R. Chiya - Beraisa):</span> If a 'widowed' door drags on the ground, one may not close with it.</p></div>
<div class="indent1"><span class="nm">(j)</span><p><span class="cl">Question:</span> What is a widowed door?</p></div>
<div class="indent1"><span class="nm">(k)</span><p><span class="cl">Answer #1:</span> It is made of only one board. (It looks like he builds onto the wall.)</p></div>
<div class="indent1"><span class="nm">(l)</span><p><span class="cl">Answer #2:</span> It does not have crossbeams [to solidify it].</p></div>
<div class="indent1"><span class="nm">(m)</span><p><span class="cl">(Rav Yehudah):</span> When making a [woodpile for a] bonfire [on Yom Tov], one holds the wood that will be on top, then places under it the wood that will be underneath. One may not build it from the bottom up. (This is like building);</p></div>
<div class="indent1"><span class="nm">(n)</span><p>The same applies to placing an egg [on a grill or on sticks over coals], a pot [over and between two barrels], a bed (a hide that is tied onto side walls) and barrels [on top of each other].</p></div>
<div class="indent1"><span class="nm">(o)</span><p><span class="cl">A Tzeduki (to R. Yehoshua):</span> You are compared to thorns - "Tovam k'Chedek"!</p></div>
<div class="indent1"><span class="nm">(p)</span><p><span class="cl">R. Yehoshua:</span> Fool! Read the end of the verse - "Yashar mi'Mesuchah"! (Our Tzadikim protect us like a Sukah.)</p></div>
<div class="indent1"><span class="nm">(q)</span><p><span class="cl">Question:</span> Why does it say "Tovam <i>k'Chedek</i>"?</p></div>
<div class="indent1"><span class="nm">(r)</span><p><span class="cl">Answer #1:</span> Just like thorns guard a breach, our Tzadikim protect us.</p></div>
<div class="indent1"><span class="nm">(s)</span><p><span class="cl">Answer #2:</span> They are Mehadek (grind; 'Hei' and 'Ches' are interchangeable) Resha'im to Gehinom - "Kumi v'Dushi Vas Tziyon... va'Hadikos Amim Rabim."</p></div>
<div class="subject"><span class="nm">2)</span><p>OPENING OR LOCKING IN ANOTHER RESHUS</p></div>
<div class="indent1"><span class="nm">(a)</span><p><span class="cl">(Mishnah - R. Meir):</span> One may not stand in Reshus ha'Yachid and unlock [using a key] in Reshus ha'Rabim, or stand in Reshus ha'Rabim and unlock in Reshus ha'Yachid, unless [in the latter case] he made a Mechitzah 10 Tefachim tall [around the door and stands inside the wall].</p></div>
<div class="indent1"><span class="nm">(b)</span><p><span class="cl">Chachamim:</span> A case occurred in a butcher's market in Yerushalayim, in which people would lock and leave the key in the window over the door!</p></div>
<div class="indent1"><span class="nm">(c)</span><p><span class="cl">R. Yosi:</span> It was a market of wool merchants. (<a href=ev-ps-appendix.htm#33>See note 33 in Appendix</a>.)</p></div>
<div class="indent1"><span class="nm">(d)</span><p><span class="cl">(Gemara) Question:</span> R. Meir discusses [unlocking in Reshus ha'Yachid when standing in] Reshus ha'Rabim [or vice-versa]. How can Chachamim bring a proof from a Karmelis?!</p></div>
<div class="indent2"><span class="nm">1.</span><p><span class="cl">(Rabah bar bar Chanah):</span> Had they not locked the doors of Yerushalayim at night, one who carried in it would have been liable for carrying in Reshus ha'Rabim.</p></div>
<div class="indent1"><span class="nm">(e)</span><p><span class="cl">Answer #1 (Rav Papa):</span> Rabah teaches about before breaches were made in the walls. The Mishnah discusses after breaches were made. (Then, Yerushalayim was Reshus ha'Rabim.)</p></div>
<div class="indent1"><span class="nm">(f)</span><p><span class="cl">Answer #2 (Rava):</span> The Seifa discusses gates to a garden;</p></div>
<div class="indent2"><span class="nm">1.</span><p>R. Meir says, similarly, one may not stand in Reshus ha'Yachid and unlock in Karmelis or stand in Karmelis and unlock in Reshus ha'Yachid, unless [in the latter case] he made a Mechitzah 10 Tefachim tall;</p></div>
<div class="bbbline">101b----------------------------------------101b</p></div>
<div class="indent2"><span class="nm">2.</span><p><span class="cl">Chachamim:</span> A case occurred in a butcher's market in Yerushalayim. People would lock and leave the key in the window over the door!</p></div>
<div class="indent2"><span class="nm">3.</span><p><span class="cl">R. Yosi:</span> It was a market of wool merchants.</p></div>
<div class="indent1"><span class="nm">(g)</span><p><span class="cl">(Beraisa):</span> If the gate of a garden [open to Reshus ha'Rabim] has a Beis Sha'ar inside, one may open or lock it from the inside. (The Beis Sha'ar and the lock are both Reshus ha'Yachid; and the garden is a Karmelis.) If it has a Beis Sha'ar outside, one may open or lock from the outside. (See Perush Chai diagram, Perek 10 number 69, in the <a href=../chai/eruv-10chai069.jpg>English Charts</a> section);</p></div>
<div class="indent1"><span class="nm">(h)</span><p>If it has a Beis Sha'ar inside and outside, one may open or lock it from the inside or outside. If it does not have in either place, one may not open or lock it from either place.</p></div>
<div class="indent1"><span class="nm">(i)</span><p>The same applies to stores open to Reshus ha'Rabim. If the lock is within 10 of the ground (it is a Karmelis), one brings the key from before Shabbos and puts it on the threshold. On Shabbos, he opens or locks and returns it to its place.</p></div>
<div class="indent1"><span class="nm">(j)</span><p>R. Meir says, if the lock is above 10, one brings the key from before Shabbos and puts it in the lock. On Shabbos, he opens or locks and returns it to its place [over the lock];</p></div>
<div class="indent1"><span class="nm">(k)</span><p>Chachamim say, even if the lock is above 10, one brings the key from before Shabbos and puts it on the threshold. On Shabbos, he opens or locks and returns it to its place or to a window over the opening;</p></div>
<div class="indent2"><span class="nm">1.</span><p>If the window is four by four it is forbidden, for this is like Hotza'ah from Reshus [of the threshold, a Karmelis] to Reshus [ha'Yachid, i.e. the window].</p></div>
<div class="indent1"><span class="nm">(l)</span><p><span class="cl">Inference:</span> 'The same applies to stores...' implies that the threshold is a Karmelis. (If it were Reshus ha'Yachid or Reshus ha'Rabim, when the lock is within 10 one could not move it to the lock, for this is forbidden regarding a gate to a garden. See the diagram cited above in (g).)</p></div>
<div class="indent1"><span class="nm">(m)</span><p><span class="cl">Question:</span> What kind of lock is discussed?</p></div>
<div class="indent2"><span class="nm">1.</span><p>If it is less than four by four [Tefachim], it is Makom Patur!</p></div>
<div class="indent2"><span class="nm">2.</span><p>If it is [at least] four by four, when it is above 10 Chachamim would not permit to move the key from the threshold to the lock. This is from Karmelis to Reshus ha'Yachid!</p></div>
<div class="indent1"><span class="nm">(n)</span><p><span class="cl">Answer (Abaye):</span> It is less than four by four, but there is room in the door to carve out and complete the Shi'ur. R. Meir says Chokekim Lehashlim (it is Reshus ha'Yachid, as if it was carved out), and Chachamim do not (it is Makom Patur).</p></div>
<div class="indent1"><span class="nm">(o)</span><p><span class="cl">(Rav Bivi bar Abaye):</span> We learn three things from this Beraisa:</p></div>
<div class="indent2"><span class="nm">1.</span><p>We learn that [R. Meir holds] Chokekim Lehashlim;</p></div>
<div class="indent2"><span class="nm">2.</span><p>We learn that R. Meir retracted from what he said (above, f.1) about gates to a garden. (He required a Mechitzah 10 tall. Here, when the lock is above 10 (a Reshus ha'Yachid) R. Meir permits to stand in a porch (Karmelis) and unlock. He does not decree lest he bring the key to himself - Rashi, according to Maharshal.)</p></div>
<div class="indent2"><span class="nm">3.</span><p>From Chachamim [who forbid transferring from the porch (Karmelis) to the lock and then to the window (Reshus ha'Yachid), even though they consider the lock to be Makom Patur] we learn Rav Dimi's teaching:</p></div>
<div class="indent3"><span class="nm">i.</span><p><span class="cl">(Rav Dimi):</span> If a place [at least three Tefachim tall] is less than four by four [Tefachim], people of Reshus ha'Rabim or Reshus ha'Yachid may unload on it, as long as they do not use it to transfer [from one Reshus to the other].</p></div>
<div class="subject"><span class="nm">3)</span><p>WHICH BOLTS MAY BE MOVED ON SHABBOS?</p></div>
<div class="indent1"><span class="nm">(a)</span><p><span class="cl">(Mishnah - R. Eliezer):</span> If a bolt [for locking a door] has a thick end [that can be used to mash], one may not lock with it [on Shabbos. It looks like building];</p></div>
<div class="indent1"><span class="nm">(b)</span><p>R. Yosi permits.</p></div>
<div class="indent2"><span class="nm">1.</span><p><span class="cl">R. Eliezer:</span> A case occurred in Teveryah, and people permitted it until R. Gamliel and Chachamim forbade them!</p></div>
<div class="indent2"><span class="nm">2.</span><p><span class="cl">R. Yosi:</span> No, people forbade it until R. Gamliel and Chachamim permitted them!</p></div>
