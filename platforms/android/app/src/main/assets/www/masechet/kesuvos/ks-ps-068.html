<div class="subject"><span class="nm">1)</span><p>WHO IS ENTITLED TO RECEIVE TZEDAKAH</p></div>
<div class="indent1"><span class="nm">(a)</span><p>R. Chanina used to give four Zuz to a certain man every Erev Shabbos. Once, he sent the money with his wife.</p></div>
<div class="indent1"><span class="nm">(b)</span><p><span class="cl">His wife:</span> He does not need the money.</p></div>
<div class="indent1"><span class="nm">(c)</span><p><span class="cl">R. Chanina:</span> What did you see?</p></div>
<div class="indent1"><span class="nm">(d)</span><p><span class="cl">His wife:</span> I heard them saying 'on what should we dine today, on linen cloths, or colored silk cloths?'</p></div>
<div class="indent1"><span class="nm">(e)</span><p><span class="cl">R. Chanina:</span> He is a swindler!</p></div>
<div class="indent2"><span class="nm">1.</span><p><span class="cl">(R. Elazar):</span> We must be appreciative of swindlers! If not for them, (we could assume that everyone who requests Tzedakah is truly poor, and) we would sin each day (for not giving) - "He (an Oni to whom you did not give) will cry to Hash-m about you, and you will bear sin".</p></div>
<div class="indent1"><span class="nm">(f)</span><p><span class="cl">(R. Chiya bar Rav mi'Difti):</span> Anyone who declines to give Tzedakah is like one who serves idolatry;</p></div>
<div class="indent2"><span class="nm">1.</span><p>It says here "Lest there be a Vliya'al (base) thought in your heart", like it says about idolatry "Vliya'al". <span class="note">(<span>Note:</span> The verse here discusses one who is afraid to <i>lend </i>before Shemitah. Perhaps this is like Tzedakah, for Shemitah is prone to wipe out the loan!)</span></p></div>
<div class="indent1"><span class="nm">(g)</span><p><span class="cl">(Beraisa):</span> One who makes his eye appear blind, or his stomach swollen, or his thigh shriveled, will experience this before he dies!</p></div>
<div class="indent1"><span class="nm">(h)</span><p>One who takes Tzedakah and does not need it will come to need it before he dies.</p></div>
<div class="indent1"><span class="nm">(i)</span><p><span class="cl">(Mishnah):</span> We do not force him to sell his house or the Kelim he uses.</p></div>
<div class="indent1"><span class="nm">(j)</span><p><span class="cl">Contradiction (Beraisa):</span> If he used gold Kelim, he will use silver. If he used silver Kelim, he will use copper.</p></div>
<div class="indent1"><span class="nm">(k)</span><p><span class="cl">Answer #1 (Rav Zvid):</span> He must sell a bed or table of gold or silver. He may keep cups and bowls of gold or silver.</p></div>
<div class="indent1"><span class="nm">(l)</span><p><span class="cl">Objection:</span> Presumably, he need not use cheaper cups and bowls because they repulse him. Likewise, he can refuse to accept an (inferior) bed and table!</p></div>
<div class="indent1"><span class="nm">(m)</span><p><span class="cl">Answer #2 (Rava brei d'Rabah):</span> He must sell a silver back-scratcher.</p></div>
<div class="indent1"><span class="nm">(n)</span><p><span class="cl">Answer #3 (Rav Papa):</span> If one wants to collect gifts for the poor, he may keep his Kelim (even though if he sold them he would have 200 Zuz and would not be considered poor). If we find out that a rich person took such gifts and we demand repayment, if he cannot pay he must sell his finer Kelim.</p></div>
<div class="subject"><span class="nm">2)</span><p>THE DOWRY OF AN ORPHAN</p></div>
<div class="indent1"><span class="nm">(a)</span><p><span class="cl">(Mishnah):</span> If an orphan girl was married off willingly by her mother or brothers, and they wrote her a dowry of 50 or 100 Zuz, when she gets older she can force them to give to her what was appropriate;</p></div>
<div class="indent1"><span class="nm">(b)</span><p>R. Yehudah says, if the father married off one daughter, we give to the second like he gave to the first;</p></div>
<div class="indent1"><span class="nm">(c)</span><p>Chachamim say, sometimes a person is poor and becomes wealthy, or vice-versa. Rather, we estimate the value of the possessions and give to her.</p></div>
<div class="indent1"><span class="nm">(d)</span><p><span class="cl">(Gemara - Shmuel):</span> For Parnasah (the dowry given to a girl who gets married after her father died) we estimate according to the father (how much we think that he would have given).</p></div>
<div class="indent1"><span class="nm">(e)</span><p><span class="cl">Question (Beraisa):</span> Daughters receive food and Parnasah from the property of their father.</p></div>
<div class="indent2"><span class="nm">1.</span><p>We do not say that if the father was alive, he would give so much. Rather, we appraise the property, and give accordingly.</p></div>
<div class="indent2"><span class="nm">2.</span><p><span class="cl">Suggestion:</span> Parnasah is the dowry she receives when she marries!</p></div>
<div class="indent1"><span class="nm">(f)</span><p><span class="cl">Answer (Rav Nachman bar Yitzchak):</span> No, it means supplying her needs (her food, while she lives with her brothers).</p></div>
<div class="indent2"><span class="nm">1.</span><p><span class="cl">Question:</span> It says that she receives food and Parnasah. Surely, 'food' is her own needs, and Parnasah is the needs of marriage!</p></div>
<div class="indent2"><span class="nm">2.</span><p><span class="cl">Answer:</span> No, both refer to her own needs. 'Food' refers to food and drink; 'Parnasah' refers to clothing and coverings.</p></div>
<div class="indent1"><span class="nm">(g)</span><p><span class="cl">Question (Mishnah - Chachamim):</span> Sometimes a person is poor and becomes wealthy, or vice-versa. Rather, we estimate the value of the possessions, and give to her.</p></div>
<div class="indent2"><span class="nm">1.</span><p><span class="cl">Question:</span> What do 'poor' and 'wealthy' mean?</p></div>
<div class="indent3"><span class="nm">i.</span><p><span class="cl">Suggestion:</span> They refer to financial poverty and wealth.</p></div>
<div class="indent3"><span class="nm">ii.</span><p><span class="cl">Rejection:</span> How can the first Tana say that if the father grew poor, we give the second daughter like the first. He lacks the means!</p></div>
<div class="indent2"><span class="nm">2.</span><p><span class="cl">Answer:</span> Rather, they mean 'stingy' or 'generous'.</p></div>
<div class="indent2"><span class="nm">3.</span><p><span class="cl">Summation of question:</span> The Mishnah says that we estimate the property and give to her. We do not estimate the father's intention. This refutes Shmuel!</p></div>
<div class="indent1"><span class="nm">(h)</span><p><span class="cl">Answer:</span> Shmuel is not refuted. He holds like R. Yehudah:</p></div>
<div class="indent2"><span class="nm">1.</span><p><span class="cl">(Mishnah - R. Yehudah):</span> If the father married off one daughter, we give to the second like he gave to the first.</p></div>
<div class="indent1"><span class="nm">(i)</span><p><span class="cl">Question:</span> If so, Shmuel should have said that the Halachah follows R. Yehudah!</p></div>
<div class="indent1"><span class="nm">(j)</span><p><span class="cl">Answer:</span> Had he said so, one might have thought that this is only when the father married off a daughter during his lifetime, and we saw how much he wanted to give to his daughters. We would not know that it is even if he never married off a daughter;</p></div>
<div class="indent2"><span class="nm">1.</span><p>Shmuel teaches that R. Yehudah follows estimation whether or not he married off any daughters.</p></div>
<div class="indent2"><span class="nm">2.</span><p>The Mishnah discusses when he married off a daughter to show the extremity of Chachamim. Even though the father revealed his opinion (of how much to give), we do not estimate his opinion (for other daughters).</p></div>
<div class="indent1"><span class="nm">(k)</span><p><span class="cl">Rava (to Rav Chisda):</span> They say in your name that the Halachah follows R. Yehudah.</p></div>
<div class="indent1"><span class="nm">(l)</span><p><span class="cl">Rav Chisda:</span> It should be Hash-m's will that all such nice teachings be said in my name!</p></div>
<div class="indent1"><span class="nm">(m)</span><p><span class="cl">Question:</span> Rava holds that the Halachah does not follow R. Yehudah!</p></div>
<div class="indent2"><span class="nm">1.</span><p><span class="cl">(Beraisa - Rebbi):</span> A daughter fed by the brothers receives a tenth of the property (for Parnasah).</p></div>
<div class="indent2"><span class="nm">2.</span><p><span class="cl">(Rava):</span> The Halachah follows Rebbi.</p></div>
<div class="indent1"><span class="nm">(n)</span><p><span class="cl">Answer:</span> Rava says that the Halachah follows R. Yehudah when we know the man's nature. When we know nothing about him, the Halachah follows Rebbi.</p></div>
<div class="indent1"><span class="nm">(o)</span><p><span class="cl">Support:</span> Rav Ada bar Ahavah reported that Rebbi once gave a 12th for Parnasah.</p></div>
<div class="indent2"><span class="nm">1.</span><p><span class="cl">Question:</span> Rebbi said that we give a tenth!</p></div>
<div class="indent2"><span class="nm">2.</span><p><span class="cl">Answer:</span> We must say that Rebbi himself said a tenth only when we do not know the man's nature.</p></div>
<div class="indent1"><span class="nm">(p)</span><p><span class="cl">(Beraisa - Rebbi):</span> A daughter fed by the brothers receives a tenth of the property;</p></div>
<div class="indent2"><span class="nm">1.</span><p><span class="cl">Question:</span> If a man left 10 daughters and one son, do the daughters get all the property?!</p></div>
<div class="indent2"><span class="nm">2.</span><p><span class="cl">Answer (Rebbi):</span> The first daughter receives a tenth; the next gets a tenth of what remains (90%.) The next gets a tenth of what remains (81%), and so on. Then, the girls split their money equally among themselves.</p></div>
<div class="bbbline">68b----------------------------------------68b</p></div>
<div class="indent2"><span class="nm">3.</span><p><span class="cl">Question:</span> Each daughter took for herself (she was entitled to a tenth. Why must she share it with her sisters?)</p></div>
<div class="indent2"><span class="nm">4.</span><p><span class="cl">Answer:</span> Rebbi said they share equally only when they all come to get married at the same time.</p></div>
<div class="indent2"><span class="nm">5.</span><p>This supports Rav Masnah:</p></div>
<div class="indent3"><span class="nm">i.</span><p><span class="cl">(Rav Masnah):</span> If they all come to get married at the same time, they receive one tenth.</p></div>
<div class="indent3"><span class="nm">ii.</span><p><span class="cl">Question:</span> This is unreasonable!</p></div>
<div class="indent3"><span class="nm">iii.</span><p><span class="cl">Correction:</span> Rather they receive a tenth, like one (i.e. they share equally).</p></div>
<div class="subject"><span class="nm">3)</span><p>WHEN DOES A BOGERES FORFEIT PARNASAH</p></div>
<div class="indent1"><span class="nm">(a)</span><p><span class="cl">(Beraisa #1 - Rebbi):</span> Whether a girl became a Bogeres before or after marrying, she ceases to be fed from the estate, but she does not forfeit Parnasah;</p></div>
<div class="indent1"><span class="nm">(b)</span><p>R. Shimon ben Elazar says, (if she became Bogeres before marrying) she forfeits also Parnasah.</p></div>
<div class="indent2"><span class="nm">1.</span><p>To avoid this, she can 'hire' a husband (i.e. make it financially advantageous for a man to marry her before Bagrus), and she receives her Parnasah.</p></div>
<div class="indent1"><span class="nm">(c)</span><p><span class="cl">(Rav Nachman):</span> The Halachah follows Rebbi.</p></div>
<div class="indent1"><span class="nm">(d)</span><p><span class="cl">Question (Rava - Mishnah):</span> If an orphan was willingly married off by her mother or brothers and they wrote for her 50 or 100 Zuz, when she grows up she can claim the rest of what was appropriate for her to get.</p></div>
<div class="indent2"><span class="nm">1.</span><p><span class="cl">Inference:</span> This is because she was a minor. An adult cannot claim the rest, because she pardoned her privilege. (Presumably, the Halachah follows our Stam Mishnah!)</p></div>
<div class="indent1"><span class="nm">(e)</span><p><span class="cl">Answer:</span> An adult pardoned Parnasah only if she didn't protest.</p></div>
<div class="indent1"><span class="nm">(f)</span><p><span class="cl">Support:</span> If this were not true, Rebbi would contradict himself!</p></div>
<div class="indent2"><span class="nm">1.</span><p><span class="cl">(Beraisa #2 - Rebbi):</span> A daughter fed by the brothers receives a tenth of the property.</p></div>
<div class="indent2"><span class="nm">2.</span><p><span class="cl">Inference:</span> She receives only if she is fed, i.e. before Bagrus!</p></div>
<div class="indent2"><span class="nm">3.</span><p><span class="cl">(Question:</span> In Beraisa #1, Rebbi says that she receives even after Bagrus!)</p></div>
<div class="indent2"><span class="nm">4.</span><p><span class="cl">Answer:</span> We must answer like we said above, that she (an adult) pardoned Parnasah only if she didn't protest.</p></div>
<div class="indent1"><span class="nm">(g)</span><p><span class="cl">Ravina (to Rava):</span> Rav Ada bar Ahavah said in your name that she need not protest when she turns Bogeres <i>or</i> is married, but must protest if she turns Bogeres <i>and</i> marries.</p></div>
<div class="indent1"><span class="nm">(h)</span><p><span class="cl">Question:</span> Rava does not say so!</p></div>
<div class="indent2"><span class="nm">1.</span><p>Rava asked Rav Nachman (above) and accepted his answer, that even a Na'arah who marries forfeits Parnasah, if she does not protest!</p></div>
<div class="indent1"><span class="nm">(i)</span><p><span class="cl">Answer:</span> When she is fed by the brothers (after Nisu'in), only a Bogeres must protest. (We can say that a Na'arah was silent because they feed her.) If she is not fed, even a Na'arah who marries must protest.</p></div>
<div class="subject"><span class="nm">4)</span><p>DIFFERENCES BETWEEN PARNASAH AND FOOD</p></div>
<div class="indent1"><span class="nm">(a)</span><p><span class="cl">(Rav Huna citing Rebbi):</span> Parnasah is unlike (feeding daughters from the estate after the father dies,) a stipulation of the Kesuvah.</p></div>
<div class="indent1"><span class="nm">(b)</span><p><span class="cl">Question:</span> In what respect are they different?</p></div>
<div class="indent2"><span class="nm">1.</span><p><span class="cl">Suggestion:</span> If the brothers sold inherited property, daughters may seize it to collect Parnasah, but not for food.</p></div>
<div class="indent2"><span class="nm">2.</span><p><span class="cl">Rejection:</span> Rav Huna would not need to teach this. All know this law, for it comes up every day!</p></div>
<div class="indent1"><span class="nm">(c)</span><p><span class="cl">Answer #1:</span> Parnasah can be collected from Metaltelim, but food cannot.</p></div>
<div class="indent1"><span class="nm">(d)</span><p><span class="cl">Rejection:</span> Rebbi holds that also food is collected from Metaltelim!</p></div>
<div class="indent2"><span class="nm">1.</span><p><span class="cl">(Beraisa - Rebbi):</span> Both property with Acharayos (it can be seized by creditors after it was sold, i.e. land) and without Acharayos (Metaltelim) are used to feed the widow and daughters.</p></div>
<div class="indent1"><span class="nm">(e)</span><p><span class="cl">Answer #2 (Beraisa):</span> If: one said 'my daughters should not be fed from my estate (after I die),' they are fed anyway. If he said 'they should not receive Parnasah', they do not.</p></div>
