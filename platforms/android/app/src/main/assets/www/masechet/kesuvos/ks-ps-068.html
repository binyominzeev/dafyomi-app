<p class="bas subject"><span class="nm">1)</span>WHO IS ENTITLED TO RECEIVE <i>TZEDAKAH</i></p>
<p class="bas indent1"><span class="nm">(a)</span>R. Chanina used to give four Zuz to a certain man every Erev Shabbos. Once, he sent the money with his wife.</p>
<p class="bas indent1"><span class="nm">(b)</span><span class="cl">His wife:</span> He does not need the money.</p>
<p class="bas indent1"><span class="nm">(c)</span><span class="cl">R. Chanina:</span> What did you see?</p>
<p class="bas indent1"><span class="nm">(d)</span><span class="cl">His wife:</span> I heard them saying 'on what should we dine today, on linen cloths, or colored silk cloths?'</p>
<p class="bas indent1"><span class="nm">(e)</span><span class="cl">R. Chanina:</span> He is a swindler!</p>
<p class="bas indent2"><span class="nm">1.</span><span class="cl">(R. Elazar):</span> We must be appreciative of swindlers! If not for them, (we could assume that everyone who requests Tzedakah is truly poor, and) we would sin each day (for not giving) - "He (an Oni to whom you did not give) will cry to Hash-m about you, and you will bear sin".</p>
<p class="bas indent1"><span class="nm">(f)</span><span class="cl">(R. Chiya bar Rav mi'Difti):</span> Anyone who declines to give Tzedakah is like one who serves idolatry;</p>
<p class="bas indent2"><span class="nm">1.</span>It says here "Lest there be a Vliya'al (base) thought in your heart", like it says about idolatry "Vliya'al". <span class="note">(<span class="notewd">Note:</span> The verse here discusses one who is afraid to <i>lend </i>before Shemitah. Perhaps this is like Tzedakah, for Shemitah is prone to wipe out the loan!)</span></p>
<p class="bas indent1"><span class="nm">(g)</span><span class="cl">(Beraisa):</span> One who makes his eye appear blind, or his stomach swollen, or his thigh shriveled, will experience this before he dies!</p>
<p class="bas indent1"><span class="nm">(h)</span>One who takes Tzedakah and does not need it will come to need it before he dies.</p>
<p class="bas indent1"><span class="nm">(i)</span><span class="cl">(Mishnah):</span> We do not force him to sell his house or the Kelim he uses.</p>
<p class="bas indent1"><span class="nm">(j)</span><span class="cl">Contradiction (Beraisa):</span> If he used gold Kelim, he will use silver. If he used silver Kelim, he will use copper.</p>
<p class="bas indent1"><span class="nm">(k)</span><span class="cl">Answer #1 (Rav Zvid):</span> He must sell a bed or table of gold or silver. He may keep cups and bowls of gold or silver.</p>
<p class="bas indent1"><span class="nm">(l)</span><span class="cl">Objection:</span> Presumably, he need not use cheaper cups and bowls because they repulse him. Likewise, he can refuse to accept an (inferior) bed and table!</p>
<p class="bas indent1"><span class="nm">(m)</span><span class="cl">Answer #2 (Rava brei d'Rabah):</span> He must sell a silver back-scratcher.</p>
<p class="bas indent1"><span class="nm">(n)</span><span class="cl">Answer #3 (Rav Papa):</span> If one wants to collect gifts for the poor, he may keep his Kelim (even though if he sold them he would have 200 Zuz and would not be considered poor). If we find out that a rich person took such gifts and we demand repayment, if he cannot pay he must sell his finer Kelim.</p>
<p class="bas subject"><span class="nm">2)</span>THE DOWRY OF AN ORPHAN</p>
<p class="bas indent1"><span class="nm">(a)</span><span class="cl">(Mishnah):</span> If an orphan girl was married off willingly by her mother or brothers, and they wrote her a dowry of 50 or 100 Zuz, when she gets older she can force them to give to her what was appropriate;</p>
<p class="bas indent1"><span class="nm">(b)</span>R. Yehudah says, if the father married off one daughter, we give to the second like he gave to the first;</p>
<p class="bas indent1"><span class="nm">(c)</span>Chachamim say, sometimes a person is poor and becomes wealthy, or vice-versa. Rather, we estimate the value of the possessions and give to her.</p>
<p class="bas indent1"><span class="nm">(d)</span><span class="cl">(Gemara - Shmuel):</span> For Parnasah (the dowry given to a girl who gets married after her father died) we estimate according to the father (how much we think that he would have given).</p>
<p class="bas indent1"><span class="nm">(e)</span><span class="cl">Question (Beraisa):</span> Daughters receive food and Parnasah from the property of their father.</p>
<p class="bas indent2"><span class="nm">1.</span>We do not say that if the father was alive, he would give so much. Rather, we appraise the property, and give accordingly.</p>
<p class="bas indent2"><span class="nm">2.</span><span class="cl">Suggestion:</span> Parnasah is the dowry she receives when she marries!</p>
<p class="bas indent1"><span class="nm">(f)</span><span class="cl">Answer (Rav Nachman bar Yitzchak):</span> No, it means supplying her needs (her food, while she lives with her brothers).</p>
<p class="bas indent2"><span class="nm">1.</span><span class="cl">Question:</span> It says that she receives food and Parnasah. Surely, 'food' is her own needs, and Parnasah is the needs of marriage!</p>
<p class="bas indent2"><span class="nm">2.</span><span class="cl">Answer:</span> No, both refer to her own needs. 'Food' refers to food and drink; 'Parnasah' refers to clothing and coverings.</p>
<p class="bas indent1"><span class="nm">(g)</span><span class="cl">Question (Mishnah - Chachamim):</span> Sometimes a person is poor and becomes wealthy, or vice-versa. Rather, we estimate the value of the possessions, and give to her.</p>
<p class="bas indent2"><span class="nm">1.</span><span class="cl">Question:</span> What do 'poor' and 'wealthy' mean?</p>
<p class="bas indent3"><span class="nm">i.</span><span class="cl">Suggestion:</span> They refer to financial poverty and wealth.</p>
<p class="bas indent3"><span class="nm">ii.</span><span class="cl">Rejection:</span> How can the first Tana say that if the father grew poor, we give the second daughter like the first. He lacks the means!</p>
<p class="bas indent2"><span class="nm">2.</span><span class="cl">Answer:</span> Rather, they mean 'stingy' or 'generous'.</p>
<p class="bas indent2"><span class="nm">3.</span><span class="cl">Summation of question:</span> The Mishnah says that we estimate the property and give to her. We do not estimate the father's intention. This refutes Shmuel!</p>
<p class="bas indent1"><span class="nm">(h)</span><span class="cl">Answer:</span> Shmuel is not refuted. He holds like R. Yehudah:</p>
<p class="bas indent2"><span class="nm">1.</span><span class="cl">(Mishnah - R. Yehudah):</span> If the father married off one daughter, we give to the second like he gave to the first.</p>
<p class="bas indent1"><span class="nm">(i)</span><span class="cl">Question:</span> If so, Shmuel should have said that the Halachah follows R. Yehudah!</p>
<p class="bas indent1"><span class="nm">(j)</span><span class="cl">Answer:</span> Had he said so, one might have thought that this is only when the father married off a daughter during his lifetime, and we saw how much he wanted to give to his daughters. We would not know that it is even if he never married off a daughter;</p>
<p class="bas indent2"><span class="nm">1.</span>Shmuel teaches that R. Yehudah follows estimation whether or not he married off any daughters.</p>
<p class="bas indent2"><span class="nm">2.</span>The Mishnah discusses when he married off a daughter to show the extremity of Chachamim. Even though the father revealed his opinion (of how much to give), we do not estimate his opinion (for other daughters).</p>
<p class="bas indent1"><span class="nm">(k)</span><span class="cl">Rava (to Rav Chisda):</span> They say in your name that the Halachah follows R. Yehudah.</p>
<p class="bas indent1"><span class="nm">(l)</span><span class="cl">Rav Chisda:</span> It should be Hash-m's will that all such nice teachings be said in my name!</p>
<p class="bas indent1"><span class="nm">(m)</span><span class="cl">Question:</span> Rava holds that the Halachah does not follow R. Yehudah!</p>
<p class="bas indent2"><span class="nm">1.</span><span class="cl">(Beraisa - Rebbi):</span> A daughter fed by the brothers receives a tenth of the property (for Parnasah).</p>
<p class="bas indent2"><span class="nm">2.</span><span class="cl">(Rava):</span> The Halachah follows Rebbi.</p>
<p class="bas indent1"><span class="nm">(n)</span><span class="cl">Answer:</span> Rava says that the Halachah follows R. Yehudah when we know the man's nature. When we know nothing about him, the Halachah follows Rebbi.</p>
<p class="bas indent1"><span class="nm">(o)</span><span class="cl">Support:</span> Rav Ada bar Ahavah reported that Rebbi once gave a 12th for Parnasah.</p>
<p class="bas indent2"><span class="nm">1.</span><span class="cl">Question:</span> Rebbi said that we give a tenth!</p>
<p class="bas indent2"><span class="nm">2.</span><span class="cl">Answer:</span> We must say that Rebbi himself said a tenth only when we do not know the man's nature.</p>
<p class="bas indent1"><span class="nm">(p)</span><span class="cl">(Beraisa - Rebbi):</span> A daughter fed by the brothers receives a tenth of the property;</p>
<p class="bas indent2"><span class="nm">1.</span><span class="cl">Question:</span> If a man left 10 daughters and one son, do the daughters get all the property?!</p>
<p class="bas indent2"><span class="nm">2.</span><span class="cl">Answer (Rebbi):</span> The first daughter receives a tenth; the next gets a tenth of what remains (90%.) The next gets a tenth of what remains (81%), and so on. Then, the girls split their money equally among themselves.</p>
<p class="bas bbbline">68b----------------------------------------68b</p>
<p class="bas indent2"><span class="nm">3.</span><span class="cl">Question:</span> Each daughter took for herself (she was entitled to a tenth. Why must she share it with her sisters?)</p>
<p class="bas indent2"><span class="nm">4.</span><span class="cl">Answer:</span> Rebbi said they share equally only when they all come to get married at the same time.</p>
<p class="bas indent2"><span class="nm">5.</span>This supports Rav Masnah:</p>
<p class="bas indent3"><span class="nm">i.</span><span class="cl">(Rav Masnah):</span> If they all come to get married at the same time, they receive one tenth.</p>
<p class="bas indent3"><span class="nm">ii.</span><span class="cl">Question:</span> This is unreasonable!</p>
<p class="bas indent3"><span class="nm">iii.</span><span class="cl">Correction:</span> Rather they receive a tenth, like one (i.e. they share equally).</p>
<p class="bas subject"><span class="nm">3)</span>WHEN DOES A <i>BOGERES</i> FORFEIT <i>PARNASAH</i></p>
<p class="bas indent1"><span class="nm">(a)</span><span class="cl">(Beraisa #1 - Rebbi):</span> Whether a girl became a Bogeres before or after marrying, she ceases to be fed from the estate, but she does not forfeit Parnasah;</p>
<p class="bas indent1"><span class="nm">(b)</span>R. Shimon ben Elazar says, (if she became Bogeres before marrying) she forfeits also Parnasah.</p>
<p class="bas indent2"><span class="nm">1.</span>To avoid this, she can 'hire' a husband (i.e. make it financially advantageous for a man to marry her before Bagrus), and she receives her Parnasah.</p>
<p class="bas indent1"><span class="nm">(c)</span><span class="cl">(Rav Nachman):</span> The Halachah follows Rebbi.</p>
<p class="bas indent1"><span class="nm">(d)</span><span class="cl">Question (Rava - Mishnah):</span> If an orphan was willingly married off by her mother or brothers and they wrote for her 50 or 100 Zuz, when she grows up she can claim the rest of what was appropriate for her to get.</p>
<p class="bas indent2"><span class="nm">1.</span><span class="cl">Inference:</span> This is because she was a minor. An adult cannot claim the rest, because she pardoned her privilege. (Presumably, the Halachah follows our Stam Mishnah!)</p>
<p class="bas indent1"><span class="nm">(e)</span><span class="cl">Answer:</span> An adult pardoned Parnasah only if she didn't protest.</p>
<p class="bas indent1"><span class="nm">(f)</span><span class="cl">Support:</span> If this were not true, Rebbi would contradict himself!</p>
<p class="bas indent2"><span class="nm">1.</span><span class="cl">(Beraisa #2 - Rebbi):</span> A daughter fed by the brothers receives a tenth of the property.</p>
<p class="bas indent2"><span class="nm">2.</span><span class="cl">Inference:</span> She receives only if she is fed, i.e. before Bagrus!</p>
<p class="bas indent2"><span class="nm">3.</span><span class="cl">(Question:</span> In Beraisa #1, Rebbi says that she receives even after Bagrus!)</p>
<p class="bas indent2"><span class="nm">4.</span><span class="cl">Answer:</span> We must answer like we said above, that she (an adult) pardoned Parnasah only if she didn't protest.</p>
<p class="bas indent1"><span class="nm">(g)</span><span class="cl">Ravina (to Rava):</span> Rav Ada bar Ahavah said in your name that she need not protest when she turns Bogeres <i>or</i> is married, but must protest if she turns Bogeres <i>and</i> marries.</p>
<p class="bas indent1"><span class="nm">(h)</span><span class="cl">Question:</span> Rava does not say so!</p>
<p class="bas indent2"><span class="nm">1.</span>Rava asked Rav Nachman (above) and accepted his answer, that even a Na'arah who marries forfeits Parnasah, if she does not protest!</p>
<p class="bas indent1"><span class="nm">(i)</span><span class="cl">Answer:</span> When she is fed by the brothers (after Nisu'in), only a Bogeres must protest. (We can say that a Na'arah was silent because they feed her.) If she is not fed, even a Na'arah who marries must protest.</p>
<p class="bas subject"><span class="nm">4)</span>DIFFERENCES BETWEEN <i>PARNASAH</i> AND FOOD</p>
<p class="bas indent1"><span class="nm">(a)</span><span class="cl">(Rav Huna citing Rebbi):</span> Parnasah is unlike (feeding daughters from the estate after the father dies,) a stipulation of the Kesuvah.</p>
<p class="bas indent1"><span class="nm">(b)</span><span class="cl">Question:</span> In what respect are they different?</p>
<p class="bas indent2"><span class="nm">1.</span><span class="cl">Suggestion:</span> If the brothers sold inherited property, daughters may seize it to collect Parnasah, but not for food.</p>
<p class="bas indent2"><span class="nm">2.</span><span class="cl">Rejection:</span> Rav Huna would not need to teach this. All know this law, for it comes up every day!</p>
<p class="bas indent1"><span class="nm">(c)</span><span class="cl">Answer #1:</span> Parnasah can be collected from Metaltelim, but food cannot.</p>
<p class="bas indent1"><span class="nm">(d)</span><span class="cl">Rejection:</span> Rebbi holds that also food is collected from Metaltelim!</p>
<p class="bas indent2"><span class="nm">1.</span><span class="cl">(Beraisa - Rebbi):</span> Both property with Acharayos (it can be seized by creditors after it was sold, i.e. land) and without Acharayos (Metaltelim) are used to feed the widow and daughters.</p>
<p class="bas indent1"><span class="nm">(e)</span><span class="cl">Answer #2 (Beraisa):</span> If: one said 'my daughters should not be fed from my estate (after I die),' they are fed anyway. If he said 'they should not receive Parnasah', they do not.</p>
