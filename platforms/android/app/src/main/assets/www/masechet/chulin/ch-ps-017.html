<div class="subject"><span class="nm">1)</span><p>SHECHITAH OF CHULIN</p></div>
<div class="indent1"><span class="nm">(a)</span><p><span class="cl">Answer #2 (Rav Yosef):</span> The Mishnah is like R. Akiva;</p></div>
<div class="indent2"><span class="nm">1.</span><p><span class="cl">(Beraisa - R. Akiva):</span> "When you will be far from (the Mikdash) and you will slaughter your cattle and flock" comes to forbid an animal killed through Nechirah (tearing (Rashi; Rashba - cutting) the Simanim lengthwise).</p></div>
<div class="indent2"><span class="nm">2.</span><p>In the Midbar, Nechirah was permitted. When Yisrael entered Eretz Yisrael, it was forbidden.</p></div>
<div class="indent3"><span class="nm">i.</span><p>One might have thought that in exile, it is permitted again. The Mishnah teaches that this is not so. We must always slaughter.</p></div>
<div class="indent1"><span class="nm">(b)</span><p><span class="cl">Question:</span> What do R. Akiva and R. Yishmael argue about?</p></div>
<div class="indent1"><span class="nm">(c)</span><p><span class="cl">Answer:</span> R. Akiva holds that Basar Ta'avah was never forbidden. R. Yishmael holds that Nechirah was never permitted.</p></div>
<div class="indent1"><span class="nm">(d)</span><p><span class="cl">Question:</span> According to R. Yishmael we understand "could enough flock and cattle be slaughtered for them?";</p></div>
<div class="indent2"><span class="nm">1.</span><p>However, according to R. Akiva, why does it say "slaughtered"? It should say 'Yinacher'!</p></div>
<div class="indent1"><span class="nm">(e)</span><p><span class="cl">Answer:</span> Since Nechirah was permitted, it was like Shechitah.</p></div>
<div class="indent1"><span class="nm">(f)</span><p><span class="cl">Question:</span> According to R. Yishmael we understand the following Mishnah;</p></div>
<div class="indent2"><span class="nm">1.</span><p><span class="cl">(Mishnah):</span> If an animal became a Neveilah during the Shechitah, or if one did Nechirah or uprooted the Simanim, he is exempt from covering the blood.</p></div>
<div class="indent2"><span class="nm">2.</span><p>However, according to R. Akiva, why is he exempt? (Nechirah was considered Shechitah, just we may not eat it today!)</p></div>
<div class="indent1"><span class="nm">(g)</span><p><span class="cl">Answer:</span> Once it became forbidden, it is no longer considered Shechitah.</p></div>
<div class="indent1"><span class="nm">(h)</span><p><span class="cl">Question:</span> According to R. Akiva, who says that Shechitah was never forbidden, we understand "like you (now) eat deer and wild goat, so (in Eretz Yisrael) you will eat (Korbanos that became blemished)."</p></div>
<div class="indent2"><span class="nm">1.</span><p>However, according to R. Yishmael, deer and wild goat (cannot be Korbanos. They) were forbidden also in the Midbar!</p></div>
<div class="indent1"><span class="nm">(i)</span><p><span class="cl">Answer:</span> The Torah forbade only Behemos (cattle and flock), which could be brought for Korbanos. Wild animals (Chayos) were permitted.</p></div>
<div class="indent1"><span class="nm">(j)</span><p><span class="cl">Question (R. Yirmeyah):</span> (According to R. Akiva), if Yisrael brought limbs (of animals killed through Nechirah) into Eretz Yisrael, were they permitted?</p></div>
<div class="indent2"><span class="nm">1.</span><p><span class="cl">Question:</span> About when does he ask?</p></div>
<div class="indent3"><span class="nm">i.</span><p><span class="cl">Suggestion:</span> He asks about during the seven years of conquest.</p></div>
<div class="indent3"><span class="nm">ii.</span><p><span class="cl">Rejection:</span> Even Tamei animals were permitted, and all the more so meat of Nechirah!</p></div>
<div class="indent3"><span class="nm">iii.</span><p><span class="cl">(R. Yirmeyah bar Aba):</span> "Houses full of all good" teaches that even pork was permitted.</p></div>
<div class="indent2"><span class="nm">2.</span><p><span class="cl">Answer #1:</span> He asks about after the seven years.</p></div>
<div class="indent2"><span class="nm">3.</span><p><span class="cl">Answer #2:</span> He asks about during the seven years. The Torah permitted only the spoils of the Kanani'im, but not forbidden things of Yisraelim.</p></div>
<div class="indent1"><span class="nm">(k)</span><p>This question is unresolved.</p></div>
<div class="indent1"><span class="nm">(l)</span><p><span class="cl">Objection (Rava):</span> We explained the first two statements of the Mishnah, 'all slaughter. We always slaughter.' How do we explain the third, 'with all we slaughter'?</p></div>
<div class="indent2"><span class="nm">1.</span><p><span class="cl">Suggestion:</span> It includes a rock, glass or reed.</p></div>
<div class="indent2"><span class="nm">2.</span><p><span class="cl">Rejection:</span> It should resemble the first two clauses. If the first two discuss Shochtim (who or what is used to) slaughter(s), also the third should! If they discuss Nischatim (what is slaughtered), also the third should! (Above, we established the first two clauses to discuss Nischatim.)</p></div>
<div class="indent1"><span class="nm">(m)</span><p><span class="cl">Answer (Rava):</span> Rather, 'all slaughter' (was taught in the first Mishnah (2a) and also in the Mishnah (15b)). One of these includes a Kusi, and the other includes a Yisrael Mumar;</p></div>
<div class="indent2"><span class="nm">1.</span><p>'We always slaughter', i.e. at night or by day, on the roof or at the head of a ship;</p></div>
<div class="indent2"><span class="nm">2.</span><p>'With all we slaughter', even with a rock, glass or reed.</p></div>
<div class="subject"><span class="nm">2)</span><p>UNUSEABLE KNIVES</p></div>
<div class="indent1"><span class="nm">(a)</span><p><span class="cl">(Mishnah):</span> Except for a reaping scythe or saw.</p></div>
<div class="indent1"><span class="nm">(b)</span><p>Shmuel's father repeatedly sent blemished knives to Eretz Yisrael, and asked which disqualify Shechitah. They responded 'the Mishnah says that a saw (or a knife with a similar nick) disqualifies Shechitah.'</p></div>
<div class="bbbline">17b----------------------------------------17b</p></div>
<div class="indent1"><span class="nm">(c)</span><p><span class="cl">(Beraisa):</span> A knife with many nicks is like a saw. If it has only one nick, if it is Ogeres, it is invalid. If it is Mesuchseches, it is valid.</p></div>
<div class="indent1"><span class="nm">(d)</span><p><span class="cl">Question:</span> What are Ogeres and Mesuchseches?</p></div>
<div class="indent1"><span class="nm">(e)</span><p><span class="cl">Answer (R. Elazar):</span> Ogeres is a nick with catches (places for the Siman, i.e. Kaneh or Veshet, to get caught) on both sides. Mesuchseches has a catch on only one side.</p></div>
<div class="indent1"><span class="nm">(f)</span><p><span class="cl">Question:</span> Presumably, Ogeres is invalid because the first catch tears the flesh, and the second tears the Siman;</p></div>
<div class="indent2"><span class="nm">1.</span><p>Even Mesuchseches should be invalid. The pressure of the knife tears the flesh, and the catch tears the Siman!</p></div>
<div class="indent1"><span class="nm">(g)</span><p><span class="cl">Answer:</span> The nick is at the end of the knife.</p></div>
<div class="indent1"><span class="nm">(h)</span><p><span class="cl">Objection:</span> Still, when he is Molich (slides the knife away from himself while cutting), this tears the flesh. When he is Mevi (returns the knife), this tears the Siman!</p></div>
<div class="indent1"><span class="nm">(i)</span><p><span class="cl">Answer:</span> He was only Molich. He was not Mevi.</p></div>
<div class="indent1"><span class="nm">(j)</span><p><span class="cl">(Rava):</span> There are three laws of knives. If it has an Ogeres nick, he may not slaughter with it. If he did, the Shechitah is invalid;</p></div>
<div class="indent2"><span class="nm">1.</span><p>If it has a Mesuchseches nick, he may not slaughter with it. If he did, the Shechitah is valid;</p></div>
<div class="indent2"><span class="nm">2.</span><p>If the blade goes up and down (but there are no nicks), l'Chatchilah, he may slaughter with it.</p></div>
<div class="indent1"><span class="nm">(k)</span><p><span class="cl">Question (Rav Huna brei d'Rav Nechemyah, to Rav Ashi):</span> You said that Rava said that a Mesuchseches disqualifies the Shechitah. Here, he is Machshir!</p></div>
<div class="indent1"><span class="nm">(l)</span><p><span class="cl">Answer (Rav Ashi):</span> If he was only Molich, the Shechitah is Kosher. If he also was Mevi, it is invalid.</p></div>
<div class="indent1"><span class="nm">(m)</span><p><span class="cl">Question (Rav Acha brei d'Rav Avya):</span> If the knife is like the beard of an ear of grain (not smooth, but without nicks), what is the law?</p></div>
<div class="indent1"><span class="nm">(n)</span><p><span class="cl">Answer (Rav Ashi):</span> I would gladly eat from the meat.</p></div>
<div class="subject"><span class="nm">3)</span><p>CHECK ING THE KNIFE</p></div>
<div class="indent1"><span class="nm">(a)</span><p><span class="cl">(Rav Chisda):</span> "You will slaughter with this" teaches that a Shechitah knife must be checked.</p></div>
<div class="indent1"><span class="nm">(b)</span><p><span class="cl">Question:</span> Why must we learn from a verse? A nick in the knife disqualifies the Shechitah. Surely we must check the knife!</p></div>
<div class="indent1"><span class="nm">(c)</span><p><span class="cl">Answer:</span> The verse teaches that a Chacham must check the knife.</p></div>
<div class="indent1"><span class="nm">(d)</span><p><span class="cl">Question:</span> R. Yochanan taught that the enactment that the Chacham checks the knife was made only to honor the Chacham!</p></div>
<div class="indent1"><span class="nm">(e)</span><p><span class="cl">Answer:</span> Rav Chisda gives an Asmachta for a Rabbinic law.</p></div>
<div class="indent1"><span class="nm">(f)</span><p>In Eretz Yisrael they check the knife in the sun (alternatively - they look at its shadow). In Nehardai, they move it through water (a nick would cause ripples). Rav Sheshes checks it with the tip of his tongue. Rav Acha bar Yakov checks it with a hair;</p></div>
<div class="indent2"><span class="nm">1.</span><p><span class="cl">(Chachamim of Sura):</span> Since the knife cuts flesh, it must be checked with flesh (the finger or tongue).</p></div>
<div class="indent1"><span class="nm">(g)</span><p><span class="cl">(Rav Papa):</span> The knife must be checked with the finger and fingernail, and on three sides (the surface of the blade and the sides of the blade).</p></div>
<div class="indent1"><span class="nm">(h)</span><p><span class="cl">Ravina:</span> I heard you (Rav Ashi) quote Rava to say that the knife must be checked with the finger and fingernail, and on three sides.</p></div>
<div class="indent1"><span class="nm">(i)</span><p><span class="cl">Version #1 - Rav Ashi:</span> I said that it must be checked with the finger and fingernail. I did not say it must be checked on three sides.</p></div>
<div class="indent1"><span class="nm">(j)</span><p><span class="cl">Version #2 - Rav Ashi:</span> I said that it must be checked with the finger and fingernail, and on three sides, but I did not say this in Rava's name.</p></div>
<div class="indent1"><span class="nm">(k)</span><p>Rav Acha brei d'Rava checked a knife with his finger and fingernail and on three sides. Rav Ashi approved. Also Rav Kahana agrees.</p></div>
<div class="indent1"><span class="nm">(l)</span><p><span class="cl">(Rav Yemar):</span> It must be checked with the finger and fingernail, but it need not be checked on three sides. We learn from R. Zeira;</p></div>
<div class="indent2"><span class="nm">1.</span><p><span class="cl">(R. Zeira):</span> Shechitah with a glowing hot knife it Kosher, for the blade cuts before burning through the Simanim.</p></div>
<div class="indent2"><span class="nm">2.</span><p><span class="cl">Question:</span> It burns the Simanim on the sides (of the blade, as it cuts)!</p></div>
<div class="indent2"><span class="nm">3.</span><p><span class="cl">Answer:</span> When the Simanim are cut, the sides of the cut immediately separate from each other (so the blade does not touch them).</p></div>
<div class="indent3"><span class="nm">i.</span><p>Also regarding a cold knife, even if it has a nick on the side, it will not touch the Simanim!</p></div>
<div class="indent1"><span class="nm">(m)</span><p><span class="cl">(Rav Huna bar Rav Ketina):</span> Three things have the same intolerance for nicks:</p></div>
<div class="indent2"><span class="nm">1.</span><p>The prohibition of breaking a bone of the Korban Pesach;</p></div>
<div class="indent2"><span class="nm">2.</span><p>A nick in the ear (or other parts) of a Bechor (firstborn male animal. Such a Mum disqualifies it from being offered as a Korban, and allows a Kohen to eat it like Chulin);</p></div>
<div class="indent2"><span class="nm">3.</span><p>A Mum in (the Ervah of) a (female) animal.</p></div>
<div class="indent1"><span class="nm">(n)</span><p><span class="cl">(Rav Chisda):</span> To this list we may add a nick on a knife for Shechitah.</p></div>
<div class="indent1"><span class="nm">(o)</span><p>Rav Huna listed only Kodshim matters.</p></div>
<div class="indent1"><span class="nm">(p)</span><p>The tolerance for all of these is the same as for a nick on the Mizbe'ach.</p></div>
