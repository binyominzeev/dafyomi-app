<div class="subject"><span class="nm">1)</span><p>R. YEHUDAH ALLOWS SECHACH ONLY FROM THE FOUR MINIM</p></div>
<div class="indent1"><span class="nm">(a)</span><p><span class="cl">Question:</span> We find that R. Yehudah allows Sechach from other than the four Minim (as he disputes the dimensions of Erez planks with R. Meir)!?</p></div>
<div class="indent1"><span class="nm">(b)</span><p><span class="cl">Answer:</span> Erez is the Hadas (as taught by Rabah bar R. Huna that Hadas is one of 10 types of Erez).</p></div>
<div class="subject"><span class="nm">2)</span><p>R. MEIR ALLOWS THE MINIM TO BE BOUND WITH ANY STRING</p></div>
<div class="indent1"><span class="nm">(a)</span><p>R. Meir cites the fact that upper classes of Yerushalayim would use gold strings, and he was told, in response, that (like R. Yehudah) they would tie with one of the Minim underneath.</p></div>
<div class="indent1"><span class="nm">(b)</span><p>Rabah told those who were binding Lulavim to allow space for a hand so that the binding not be a Chatzitzah.</p></div>
<div class="indent1"><span class="nm">(c)</span><p><span class="cl">(Rava):</span> Anything made to adorn the Lulav is not a Chatzitzah.</p></div>
<div class="subject"><span class="nm">3)</span><p>CHATZITZAH AND TAKING THE LULAV</p></div>
<div class="indent1"><span class="nm">(a)</span><p><span class="cl">(Rabah):</span> It is not permitted to drape one's hand with a cloth upon taking the Lulav (not a proper Lekicha).</p></div>
<div class="indent1"><span class="nm">(b)</span><p><span class="cl">(Rava):</span> Indirect Lekicha is a proper Lekicha.</p></div>
<div class="indent2"><span class="nm">1.</span><p><span class="cl">Question:</span> What is Rava's source?</p></div>
<div class="indent2"><span class="nm">2.</span><p><span class="cl">Answer:</span> From the Mishnah which allows an extension stick to be used to lower the Eizov into the Mei Chatas for sprinkling (which requires Lekicha).</p></div>
<div class="indent2"><span class="nm">3.</span><p><span class="cl">Question:</span> Maybe the attached stick is viewed as the Eizov itself, unlike the cloth around his hand?</p></div>
<div class="bbbline">37b----------------------------------------37b</p></div>
<div class="indent2"><span class="nm">4.</span><p><span class="cl">Answer:</span> Rava's source is the fact that the ashes of the Parah may be shaken from the tube into the water, even though it requires Lekicha.</p></div>
<div class="indent1"><span class="nm">(c)</span><p><span class="cl">(Rabah):</span> One must not press the Lulav into the binding between the Hadas and Aravah lest one sever leaves resulting in a Chatzitzah.</p></div>
<div class="indent1"><span class="nm">(d)</span><p><span class="cl">(Rava):</span> Min b'Mino is not Chotzetz.</p></div>
<div class="indent1"><span class="nm">(e)</span><p><span class="cl">(Rabah):</span> One must not cut the bottom of the Lulav while it is already bound, lest the now-unattached leaves create a Chatzitzah.</p></div>
<div class="indent1"><span class="nm">(f)</span><p><span class="cl">(Rava):</span> Min b'Mino is not Chotzetz.</p></div>
<div class="subject"><span class="nm">4)</span><p>SMELLING THE MINIM</p></div>
<div class="indent1"><span class="nm">(a)</span><p><span class="cl">(Rabah):</span> It is not permitted to smell the Hadas, but it is permitted to smell the Esrog.</p></div>
<div class="indent2"><span class="nm">1.</span><p>The Hadas is made for fragrance, and has been designated away from its ordinary purpose in order to fulfil the Mitzvah.</p></div>
<div class="indent2"><span class="nm">2.</span><p>The Esrog is made for eating, and has not been restricted from being smelled.</p></div>
<div class="indent1"><span class="nm">(b)</span><p><span class="cl">(Rabah):</span> An attached Hadas may be smelled, but not an attached Esrog, as explained (and see R. Chananel).</p></div>
<div class="indent1"><span class="nm">(c)</span><p><span class="cl">(Rabah):</span> The Lulav is taken in the right (since more Mitzvos are attached to it) and the Esrog in the left.</p></div>
<div class="indent1"><span class="nm">(d)</span><p><span class="cl">Question:</span> Why do we mention Lulav in the Berachah?</p></div>
<div class="indent1"><span class="nm">(e)</span><p><span class="cl">Answer:</span> Because it is taller (above) the others.</p></div>
<div class="indent1"><span class="nm">(f)</span><p><span class="cl">Question:</span> Then raise up the Esrog and mention <i>it</i>!?</p></div>
<div class="indent1"><span class="nm">(g)</span><p><span class="cl">Answer:</span> We mean the Lulav is taller and more outstanding as a species.</p></div>
<div class="subject"><span class="nm">5)</span><p>MISHNAH: WAVING THE LULAV</p></div>
<div class="indent1"><span class="nm">(a)</span><p><span class="cl">Question:</span> When do we wave the Lulav?</p></div>
<div class="indent1"><span class="nm">(b)</span><p><span class="cl">Answer (Beis Hillel):</span> Twice at Hodu and at Ana Hash-m Hoshiyah Na.</p></div>
<div class="indent1"><span class="nm">(c)</span><p><span class="cl">Answer (Beis Shamai):</span> Also at Ana Hash-m Hatzlichah Na.</p></div>
<div class="indent1"><span class="nm">(d)</span><p><span class="cl">(R. Akiva):</span> I saw R. Gamliel and R. Yehoshua refrain from joining the others in waving at Hatzlichah Na.</p></div>
<div class="subject"><span class="nm">6)</span><p>THE WAVING</p></div>
<div class="indent1"><span class="nm">(a)</span><p><span class="cl">Question:</span> Who mentioned waving such that we should jump in with the question of when it takes place!?</p></div>
<div class="indent1"><span class="nm">(b)</span><p><span class="cl">Answer:</span> The first Mishnah in our Perek makes reference to waving when speaking of the required length of the Lulav, and our Mishnah picks up from there.</p></div>
<div class="indent1"><span class="nm">(c)</span><p>The Mishnah in Menachos describes waving the two loaves on the Kivsei Atzeres as the prototype of all waving.</p></div>
<div class="indent1"><span class="nm">(d)</span><p><span class="cl">(R. Yochanan):</span> The four directions acknowledge He Who rules over the four directions, and the up and down acknowledges His Dominion over Heaven and Earth.</p></div>
<div class="indent1"><span class="nm">(e)</span><p><span class="cl">(R. Chama b. Ukva citing R. Yosi b'Rebbi Chanina):</span> The six directions are prayers to block the Ruchos and Telalim.</p></div>
<div class="indent1"><span class="nm">(f)</span><p>This demonstrates that even the 'portions' of Mitzvos block misfortune (even if they do not block the Mitzvah).</p></div>
<div class="indent1"><span class="nm">(g)</span><p>R. Acha b. Yakov would wave and indicate that this should be a thorn in the Satan's eyes (who did not succeed in severing us from the yoke of Heaven).</p></div>
<div class="indent1"><span class="nm">(h)</span><p>It is not proper to do this, lest the Satan fight back.</p></div>
