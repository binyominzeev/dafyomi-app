<p class="bas indent1"><span class="nm">(a)</span>If Reuven was redeeming an object from Hekdesh, and did Meshichah when it was worth 100, but before he gave the money its value rose to 200, he must pay 200 to redeem it;</p>
<p class="bas indent2"><span class="nm">1.</span>It says "he will give the money" and "it will be (Chulin) for him" - redemption works only through money.</p>
<p class="bas indent1"><span class="nm">(b)</span>If he did Meshichah when it was worth 200, but before he gave the money its value dropped to 100, he must pay 200 to redeem it;</p>
<p class="bas indent2"><span class="nm">1.</span>This is because Hekdesh should be no worse than a person (if Reuven was buying from a person, he would need to pay 200).</p>
<p class="bas indent1"><span class="nm">(c)</span>If he redeemed it for 200, and before he did Meshichah, the price dropped to 100, he gives 200;</p>
<p class="bas indent2"><span class="nm">1.</span>The redemption works through money.</p>
<p class="bas indent1"><span class="nm">(d)</span>If he redeemed it for 100, and before he did Meshichah the price rose to 200, he gives 100.</p>
<p class="bas indent1"><span class="nm">(e)</span><span class="cl">Question:</span> Here also, Hekdesh should be no worse than a person (had Reuven bought from a person, he would have to pay 200)!</p>
<p class="bas indent1"><span class="nm">(f)</span><span class="cl">Answer:</span> L'Chatchilah, a seller must sell it for the price at the time the money was given. If he refuses, he is cursed (He who punished the generation of the flood... will punish one who retracts).!</p>
<p class="bas subject"><span class="nm">2)</span>WHICH MITZVOS ARE OBLIGATORY FOR WOMEN?</p>
<p class="bas indent1"><span class="nm">(a)</span><span class="cl">(Mishnah):</span> Any Mitzvah of the son on the father is obligatory for men. Women are exempt;</p>
<p class="bas indent1"><span class="nm">(b)</span>Any Mitzvah of the father on the son is obligatory for men and women;</p>
<p class="bas indent1"><span class="nm">(c)</span>Any Mitzvas Aseh sheha'Zman Gerama (a Mitzvah to do something, that applies only at certain times) is obligatory for men. Women are exempt;</p>
<p class="bas indent1"><span class="nm">(d)</span>Any Mitzvas Aseh that applies at all times is obligatory for men and women;</p>
<p class="bas indent1"><span class="nm">(e)</span>Any Lav (Mitzvah to refrain from something), whether or not it is Zman Gerama, is obligatory for men and women, with three exceptions:</p>
<p class="bas indent2"><span class="nm">1.</span>Women may round the corners of the head, shave the beard, and become Tamei Mes.</p>
<p class="bas indent1"><span class="nm">(f)</span><span class="cl">(Gemara) Question:</span> What does 'a Mitzvah of the son on the father' mean?</p>
<p class="bas indent2"><span class="nm">1.</span>If it means a Mitzvah that the son must do for the father, women are not exempt!</p>
<p class="bas indent3"><span class="nm">i.</span><span class="cl">(Beraisa):</span> "A man will fear his father and mother" - Tira'u (the plural form of 'will fear') teaches that also women are obligated.</p>
<p class="bas indent1"><span class="nm">(g)</span><span class="cl">Answer (Rav Yehudah):</span> It refers to a Mitzvah that the father must perform on his son. Men are obligated, women are exempt;</p>
<p class="bas indent2"><span class="nm">1.</span><span class="cl">(Beraisa):</span> A man is obligated to circumcise his son, redeem him (if he is a firstborn), teach him Torah, marry him off, and teach him a trade;</p>
<p class="bas indent2"><span class="nm">2.</span>Some say, he must also teach him to swim;</p>
<p class="bas indent2"><span class="nm">3.</span>Rebbi Yehudah says, anyone who does not teach his son a trade, he teaches him robbery.</p>
<p class="bas indent2"><span class="nm">4.</span><span class="cl">Objection:</span> That cannot be!</p>
<p class="bas indent2"><span class="nm">5.</span><span class="cl">Correction:</span> Rather, he it is as if he teaches him robbery,</p>
<p class="bas indent1"><span class="nm">(h)</span>"Avraham circumcised his son (like Hash-m commanded him)" teaches that a man is commanded to circumcise his son.</p>
<p class="bas indent2"><span class="nm">1.</span>If the father does not, Beis Din is commanded - "circumcise for yourselves every male".</p>
<p class="bas indent2"><span class="nm">2.</span>If Beis Din did not, the son must circumcise himself (when he is Bar Mitzvah) - "one who will not circumcise himself will get Kares".</p>
<p class="bas indent1"><span class="nm">(i)</span><span class="cl">Question:</span> What is the source that women are exempt?</p>
<p class="bas indent1"><span class="nm">(j)</span><span class="cl">Answer:</span> It says "like Hash-m commanded him", not her.</p>
<p class="bas indent1"><span class="nm">(k)</span><span class="cl">Question:</span> That discusses Avraham and Sarah. What is the source for all generations?</p>
<p class="bas indent1"><span class="nm">(l)</span><span class="cl">Answer (Beraisa - Tana d'Vei R. Yishmael):</span> Wherever it says "command", this teaches that one must be zealous, and teach that the Mitzvah applies for all generations.</p>
<p class="bas indent2"><span class="nm">1.</span>"Command Yehoshua, strengthen him and invigorate him" - i.e., make him zealous;</p>
<p class="bas indent2"><span class="nm">2.</span>"From the day Hash-m commanded and onwards, for your generations" is for all generations.</p>
<p class="bas subject"><span class="nm">3)</span>REDEMPTION OF A FIRSTBORN SON</p>
<p class="bas indent1"><span class="nm">(a)</span><span class="cl">(Mishnah):</span> A man must redeem his son.</p>
<p class="bas indent1"><span class="nm">(b)</span><span class="cl">Question:</span> What is the source of this?</p>
<p class="bas indent1"><span class="nm">(c)</span><span class="cl">Answer:</span> "You will redeem all your firstborn sons (i.e. the firstborn from each mother)."</p>
<p class="bas indent2"><span class="nm">1.</span>If the father does not, the son must redeem himself - "redeem, you will redeem".</p>
<p class="bas indent1"><span class="nm">(d)</span><span class="cl">Question:</span> What is the source that women are exempt?</p>
<p class="bas indent1"><span class="nm">(e)</span><span class="cl">Answer:</span> We read "Tifdeh" (you will redeem)" like 'Tipadeh' (you will be redeemed). Only one who must redeem himself is commanded to redeem others.</p>
<p class="bas indent1"><span class="nm">(f)</span><span class="cl">Question:</span> What is the source that a woman need not redeem herself?</p>
<p class="bas indent1"><span class="nm">(g)</span><span class="cl">Answer:</span> We read "Tifdeh" (you will redeem)" like 'Tipadeh' (you will be redeemed). One is obligated to redeem himself only if others (e.g. his father) are obligated to redeem him.</p>
<p class="bas indent1"><span class="nm">(h)</span><span class="cl">Question:</span> What is the source that others are not obligated to redeem her?</p>
<p class="bas indent1"><span class="nm">(i)</span><span class="cl">Answer:</span> It says "your sons", not your daughters.</p>
<p class="bas indent1"><span class="nm">(j)</span><span class="cl">(Beraisa):</span> If a man must redeem himself and his son, he first redeems himself;</p>
<p class="bas indent1"><span class="nm">(k)</span>Rebbi Yehudah says, he first redeems his son, for it is his own Mitzvah to redeem himself, but his son's redemption is the son's Mitzvah placed on the father!</p>
<p class="bas indent1"><span class="nm">(l)</span><span class="cl">(R. Yirmiyah):</span> If the father only has five Shekalim (the amount for one redemption), all agree that he redeems himself. A Mitzvah of his own body takes precedence;</p>
<p class="bas bbbline">29b----------------------------------------29b</p>
<p class="bas indent2"><span class="nm">1.</span>They argue in a case when he has five Shekalim of Bnei Chorin (property he still owns) and five Shekalim of Meshu'abadim (property that he sold);</p>
<p class="bas indent2"><span class="nm">2.</span>Rebbi Yehudah holds that a debt written in the Torah is like a debt on which there is a document. After redeeming his son with the Bnei Chorin, the Kohen can take the Meshu'abadim from the buyer for the father's redemption. (He could not take from a buyer for the son's redemption, for the sale preceded the obligation to redeem the son.)</p>
<p class="bas indent2"><span class="nm">3.</span>Chachamim hold that an obligation written in the Torah is not like a debt with a document (so the Kohen cannot take Meshu'abadim from the buyer). Therefore, the Mitzvah on his own body (to redeem himself) comes first.</p>
<p class="bas indent1"><span class="nm">(m)</span><span class="cl">(Beraisa):</span> If a man must redeem his son and come to Yerushalayim for the festival, first he redeems his son;</p>
<p class="bas indent1"><span class="nm">(n)</span>Rebbi Yehudah says, coming to Yerushalayim takes precedence, for this Mitzvah passes, but the Mitzvah to redeem his son does not pass.</p>
<p class="bas indent1"><span class="nm">(o)</span><span class="cl">Question:</span> Why do Chachamim disagree?</p>
<p class="bas indent1"><span class="nm">(p)</span><span class="cl">Answer:</span> "You will redeem all your firstborn sons... you will not see My countenance empty (without bringing a Korban)" teaches that redemption comes first.</p>
<p class="bas indent1"><span class="nm">(q)</span><span class="cl">(Beraisa):</span> "You will redeem all your firstborn sons" teaches that a man with many wives must redeem the firstborn of each wife.</p>
<p class="bas indent1"><span class="nm">(r)</span><span class="cl">Question:</span> This is obvious. The Torah said that it depends on "the first to leave the womb!</p>
<p class="bas indent1"><span class="nm">(s)</span><span class="cl">Answer:</span> One might have thought to learn from inheritance. Just like a firstborn for inheritance must be firstborn of the father, also for redemption;</p>
<p class="bas indent2"><span class="nm">1.</span>The Beraisa teaches that this is not so.</p>

<p class="bas indent1"><span class="nm">(c)</span><span class="cl">Answer:</span> "You will teach you sons".</p>
<p class="bas indent2"><span class="nm">1.</span>If the father did not teach the son, the son must learn himself - "v'Limadtem (and you will teach)" may be read 'v'Lamadtem (and you will learn)'.</p>
<p class="bas indent1"><span class="nm">(d)</span><span class="cl">Question:</span> What is the source that a woman is exempt from teaching her son?</p>
<p class="bas indent1"><span class="nm">(e)</span><span class="cl">Answer:</span> "V'Limadtem" may be read 'v'Lamadtem.' Only one who is commanded to learn is commanded to teach.</p>
<p class="bas indent1"><span class="nm">(f)</span><span class="cl">Question:</span> What is the source that a woman is exempt from learning?</p>
<p class="bas indent1"><span class="nm">(g)</span><span class="cl">Answer:</span> "V'Limadtem" may be read 'v'Lamadtem.' One is commanded to learn only if others are commanded to teach him.</p>

<p class="bas indent1"><span class="nm">(i)</span><span class="cl">Answer:</span> "You will teach your sons", not your daughters.</p>
<p class="bas indent1"><span class="nm">(j)</span><span class="cl">(Beraisa):</span> A man must learn and teach his son. His own learning comes first;</p>
<p class="bas indent1"><span class="nm">(k)</span>Rebbi Yehudah says, if his son is more apt to learn, his son's learning comes first.</p>
<p class="bas indent1"><span class="nm">(l)</span>Rav Acha bar Yakov sent his son to learn from Abaye. Rav Acha saw that his son was not as sharp as himself. He sent his son home, and remained to learn himself.</p>
<p class="bas indent2"><span class="nm">1.</span>Abaye recognized the merits of Rav Acha bar Yakov. He arranged that Rav Acha would need to lodge in a Beis Medrash haunted by a damaging spirit, expecting that a miracle would be done for him.</p>
<p class="bas indent2"><span class="nm">2.</span>Indeed, the spirit was killed through Rav Acha's prayer. Rav Acha was upset that he was put in danger (he was not so confident of his merits).</p>
<p class="bas indent1"><span class="nm">(m)</span><span class="cl">(Beraisa):</span> A man must learn and get married. He should learn first;</p>
<p class="bas indent2"><span class="nm">1.</span>If he cannot manage alone, he should marry first.</p>
<p class="bas indent1"><span class="nm">(n)</span><span class="cl">(Rav Yehudah):</span> The law is, a man should marry first.</p>
<p class="bas indent1"><span class="nm">(o)</span><span class="cl">Objection (R. Yochanan):</span> Can a man learn with the responsibilities of being married?!</p>
<p class="bas indent2"><span class="nm">1.</span>Rav Yehudah and R. Yochanan do not argue. Those in Bavel should first get married; those in Eretz Yisrael should first learn (Rashi; Tosfos learns oppositely).</p>
<p class="bas subject"><span class="nm">5)</span>WHEN TO GET MARRIED</p>
<p class="bas indent1"><span class="nm">(a)</span>Rav Huna had heard nice things about Rav Hamnuna. When Rav Huna saw that Rav Hamnuna's head was not covered the way married men cover it, he said that he would not look at him until he married.</p>
<p class="bas indent1"><span class="nm">(b)</span><span class="cl">(Rav Huna):</span> If one does not marry within 20 years, he will sin every day.</p>
<p class="bas indent1"><span class="nm">(c)</span><span class="cl">Objection:</span> That cannot be!</p>
<p class="bas indent1"><span class="nm">(d)</span><span class="cl">Correction:</span> Rather, he will have thoughts of sin every day.</p>
<p class="bas indent1"><span class="nm">(e)</span><span class="cl">(Rava):</span> Until 20, Hash-m awaits the day that a man will marry. If he does not marry by 20, Hash-m curses him.</p>
<p class="bas indent1"><span class="nm">(f)</span><span class="cl">(Rav Chisda):</span> I am sharper than my colleagues because I married at 16. Had I married at 14, I would not fear the evil inclination (it could not overcome me).</p>
