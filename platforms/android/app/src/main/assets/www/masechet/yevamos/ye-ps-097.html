<p class="dedicationbox">YEVAMOS 97 (18 Teves) - Two weeks of study material have been dedicated by Mrs. Estanne Abraham Fawer to honor the fifteenth Yahrzeit of her father, Rav Mordechai ben Eliezer Zvi (Rabbi Morton Weiner) Z'L, who passed away on 18 Teves 5760. May the merit of supporting and advancing Dafyomi study -- which was so important to him -- during the weeks of his Yahrzeit serve as an Iluy for his Neshamah. </p>

<p class="bas indent1"><span class="nm">(a)</span><span class="cl">Question:</span> Why was R. Yochanan so upset?</p>
<p class="bas indent1"><span class="nm">(b)</span><span class="cl">Answer:</span> This is like Rav Yehudah taught:</p>
<p class="bas indent2"><span class="nm">1.</span><span class="cl">Question:</span> "I will dwell in your tent Olamim (plural)" - can a person dwell in two worlds?!</p>
<p class="bas indent2"><span class="nm">2.</span><span class="cl">Answer:</span> David requested of Hash-m that people should say teachings in his name in this world;</p>
<p class="bas indent3"><span class="nm">i.</span><span class="cl">(R. Yochanan):</span> When people in this world recite teachings of a dead Chacham, his lips move in the grave.</p>
<p class="bas indent3"><span class="nm">ii.</span><span class="cl">(R. Yitzchak ben Ze'iri):</span> He learns from "Your palate is like good wine. It agitates the lips of the sleeping as a pile of grapes";</p>
<p class="bas indent3"><span class="nm">iii.</span>When you put your finger on a pile of grapes, it moves. Likewise, when people say teachings of Chachamim in their names in this world, their lips move in the grave.</p>
<p class="bas subject"><span class="nm">2)</span>THE AGE OF ADULTHOOD</p>
<p class="bas indent1"><span class="nm">(a)</span><span class="cl">(Mishnah):</span> A nine-year old is like (a 20-year old who did not bring hairs).</p>
<p class="bas indent1"><span class="nm">(b)</span><span class="cl">Contradiction (Mishnah):</span> If a 20-year old man did not bring two hairs, they bring a proof that he is 20 and he is a Seris. He does not do Chalitzah or Yibum;</p>
<p class="bas indent2"><span class="nm">1.</span>If a 20-year old woman did not bring two hairs, they bring a proof that she is 20 and she is an Ailonis. She does not do Chalitzah or Yibum.</p>
<p class="bas indent1"><span class="nm">(c)</span><span class="cl">Answer:</span> Rav said that the Mishnah discusses when he brought Simanim of a Seris.</p>
<p class="bas indent1"><span class="nm">(d)</span><span class="cl">Support (Rava):</span> The Mishnah says '...v'Hu (and that) he is a Seris'.</p>
<p class="bas indent1"><span class="nm">(e)</span><span class="cl">Question:</span> If he does not have Simanei Seris, when does he become an adult?</p>
<p class="bas indent1"><span class="nm">(f)</span><span class="cl">(Tana d'Vei R. Chiya):</span> He is an adult after (35,) the majority of his (expected) years.</p>
<p class="bas indent1"><span class="nm">(g)</span>When one who had not brought hairs would come before Rava, if he was weak, he would tell them to make him healthy. If he was well fed, he would tell them to thin him out.</p>
<p class="bas indent2"><span class="nm">1.</span>Sometimes pubic hairs fall off due of weakness, and sometimes due to obesity.</p>

<p class="bas subject"><span class="nm">3)</span>ONLY KIDUSHIN FORBIDS RELATIVES</p>
<p class="bas indent1"><span class="nm">(a)</span><span class="cl">(Mishnah):</span> One may marry the relatives (mother, grandmother, daughter, granddaughter and sister) of a woman he raped or enticed. One who rapes or entices the relative of his wife is Chayav (Kares);</p>
<p class="bas indent1"><span class="nm">(b)</span>A man may marry a woman raped or enticed by his father or son;</p>
<p class="bas indent1"><span class="nm">(c)</span>R. Yehudah forbids a woman raped or enticed by his father.</p>
<p class="bas indent1"><span class="nm">(d)</span><span class="cl">(Gemara):</span> Our Mishnah teaches like the following Beraisa:</p>
<p class="bas indent2"><span class="nm">1.</span><span class="cl">(Beraisa):</span> If a man raped a woman, he may marry her daughter. If he married a woman, he may not marry her daughter.</p>
<p class="bas indent1"><span class="nm">(e)</span><span class="cl">Contradiction (Beraisa):</span> One who is suspected of Bi'ah with a woman is forbidden to her mother, daughter and sister.</p>
<p class="bas indent1"><span class="nm">(f)</span><span class="cl">Answer #1:</span> It is forbidden only mid'Rabanan.</p>
<p class="bas indent1"><span class="nm">(g)</span><span class="cl">Objection:</span> If it is forbidden mid'Rabanan, would the Tana say 'one may marry (l'Chatchilah)'?!</p>
<p class="bas indent1"><span class="nm">(h)</span><span class="cl">Answer #2:</span> Our Mishnah discusses after the woman he was suspected of died. Then it is permitted even mid'Rabanan.</p>
<p class="bas indent1"><span class="nm">(i)</span><span class="cl">Question:</span> What is the source that a man may marry the relatives of a woman he raped or enticed?</p>
<p class="bas indent1"><span class="nm">(j)</span><span class="cl">Answer #1 (Beraisa):</span> Regarding all other Arayos it says 'Shechivah (lying)'. Regarding the forbidden relatives of one's wife, it says 'Kichah', to teach that the Isur applies only through marriage.</p>
<p class="bas indent1"><span class="nm">(k)</span><span class="cl">Question (Rav Papa):</span> Regarding one's sister, it says "Who will take his sister...". Is the Isur only through marriage, but Bi'ah without Kidushin is permitted?!</p>
<p class="bas indent1"><span class="nm">(l)</span><span class="cl">Answer (Abaye):</span> The Torah says 'Kichah' without specifying. When it can apply to Kidushin, it does. When it can apply (only) to Bi'ah, it means Bi'ah.</p>
<p class="bas indent1"><span class="nm">(m)</span><span class="cl">Answer #2 (to Question (i) - Rava) Question:</span> "Do not reveal the Ervah of the daughter of <i>your</i> son or daughter" implies that granddaughters (that are not yours) from <i>her</i> (the mother of your children) are permitted;</p>
<p class="bas indent2"><span class="nm">1.</span><span class="cl">Contradiction:</span> It also says "do not reveal the Ervah of a woman and her daughter; do not take the daughter of <i>her</i> son or daughter"!</p>
<p class="bas indent2"><span class="nm">2.</span><span class="cl">Resolution (Rava):</span> The first verse refers to children through rape. The second verse applies to children through marriage.</p>
<p class="bas indent2"><span class="nm">3.</span><span class="cl">Suggestion:</span> Perhaps it is the opposite!</p>
<p class="bas indent2"><span class="nm">4.</span><span class="cl">Rejection:</span> Regarding Arayos it says "She'er (kin)". This is through marriage, but not through rape.</p>
<p class="bas indent1"><span class="nm">(n)</span><span class="cl">(Mishnah - R. Yehudah):</span> One is forbidden to a woman whom his father raped.</p>
<p class="bas indent1"><span class="nm">(o)</span><span class="cl">(Rav Gidal):</span> R. Yehudah learns from "A man...will not reveal the Kenaf of his father" - one may not have Bi'ah with a woman who had Bi'ah with his father.</p>
<p class="bas indent1"><span class="nm">(p)</span><span class="cl">Question:</span> How do we know that this refers to a woman whom the father raped?</p>
<p class="bas indent1"><span class="nm">(q)</span><span class="cl">Answer:</span> We learn from the previous passage, "The man that lied with (raped) her ..."</p>
<p class="bas indent2"><span class="nm">1.</span><span class="cl">Chachamim:</span> If this were immediately before it, we would agree. Since they are not adjacent, we expound the verse like Rav Anan:</p>
<p class="bas indent3"><span class="nm">i.</span><span class="cl">(Rav Anan):</span> The verse refers to the Shomeres Yavam of his father. "Kenaf Aviv" is someone fit for his father (to do Yibum with).</p>
<p class="bas indent2"><span class="nm">2.</span><span class="cl">Question:</span> She is already forbidden to the son. It is his uncle's wife!</p>
<p class="bas indent2"><span class="nm">3.</span><span class="cl">Answer:</span> The verse adds a second Lav for Bi'ah with her.</p>
<p class="bas indent2"><span class="nm">4.</span><span class="cl">Question:</span> She is already forbidden twice, for she is a Shomeres Yavam!</p>
<p class="bas indent2"><span class="nm">5.</span><span class="cl">Answer #1:</span> The verse adds a third Lav.</p>
<p class="bas indent2"><span class="nm">6.</span><span class="cl">Answer #2:</span> After all the Yevamim die there is no Isur of a Shomeres Yavam, so this verse adds a second Isur.</p>

<p class="bas indent1"><span class="nm">(a)</span><span class="cl">Riddle #1:</span> 'He is a paternal, but not a maternal, brother, and he is my mother's husband, and I am the daughter of his wife.' (How can this arise?)</p>
<p class="bas indent1"><span class="nm">(b)</span><span class="cl">Answer (Rami bar Chama):</span> This is unlike R. Yehudah (who forbids a man to marry a woman his father raped. The girl speaking was born out of wedlock; her paternal brother married her mother).</p>
<p class="bas indent1"><span class="nm">(c)</span><span class="cl">Riddle #2:</span> 'He is my brother, and my son; I am the sister of the one I carry on my shoulder'.</p>
<p class="bas indent1"><span class="nm">(d)</span><span class="cl">Answer:</span> The case is, a Nochri had Bi'ah with his daughter. (We prefer not to say that a Yisrael did so.)</p>
<p class="bas indent1"><span class="nm">(e)</span><span class="cl">Riddle #3:</span> 'Shalom to you, my son; I am the daughter of your sister'.</p>
<p class="bas indent1"><span class="nm">(f)</span><span class="cl">Answer:</span> The case is, a Nochri had Bi'ah with his daughter's daughter.</p>
<p class="bas indent1"><span class="nm">(g)</span><span class="cl">Riddle #4 (asked to water carriers):</span> 'The one I carry is my son, and I am the daughter of his brother.'</p>
<p class="bas indent1"><span class="nm">(h)</span>The case is, a Nochri had Bi'ah with his son's daughter.</p>
<p class="bas indent1"><span class="nm">(i)</span><span class="cl">Riddle #5:</span> 'Alas, my brother is my father and my husband and the son of my husband and the husband of my mother. I am the daughter of his wife. He does not give bread to his brethren, the orphaned children of his daughter.</p>
<p class="bas indent1"><span class="nm">(j)</span>The case is, a Nochri Ploni fathered a girl Plonis through his mother, and lived with Plonis, and Ploni's father Almoni fathered children through Plonis. (Ploni married Plonis, who is his daughter and sister. Almoni died, and Ploni refused to feed Almoni's children through Plonis, who are Ploni's grandchildren and also his brothers.)</p>
<p class="bas indent1"><span class="nm">(k)</span><span class="cl">Riddle #6:</span> 'I am your brother; I am your father's sibling; I am your mother's sibling.</p>
<p class="bas indent1"><span class="nm">(l)</span><span class="cl">Answer:</span> The case is, a Nochri fathered two girls from his mother, and then fathered a son from one of his daughters. The son's mother's sister says the above to him.</p>
<p class="bas indent1"><span class="nm">(m)</span><span class="cl">Riddle #7:</span> 'I and you are the children of siblings. I and your father are the children of siblings. I and your mother are the children of siblings.'</p>
<p class="bas indent1"><span class="nm">(n)</span><span class="cl">Answer:</span> This can arise in a permitted way! Reuven, Shimon and Levi are brothers. Reuven has two daughters; Shimon married one of them and Levi's son married the other. Shimon's son says thusly to the son of Levi's son.</p>
<p class="bas subject"><span class="nm">5)</span>ARE CONVERTED RELATIVES PERMITTED TO EACH OTHER?</p>
<p class="bas indent1"><span class="nm">(a)</span><span class="cl">(Mishnah):</span> If a woman's sons converted with her, the sons do not do Yibum or Chalitzah to each other's wives. This is even if the first son was conceived before conversion and born after conversion, and the second was conceived and born after conversion;</p>
<p class="bas indent1"><span class="nm">(b)</span>The same applies to a slave whose sons were freed with her.</p>
<p class="bas indent1"><span class="nm">(c)</span><span class="cl">(Gemara):</span> The children of the slave Yudan were freed. Rav Acha bar Yakov permitted them to marry each other's wives.</p>
<p class="bas indent1"><span class="nm">(d)</span><span class="cl">Objection (Rava):</span> Rav Sheshes forbade this!</p>
<p class="bas indent2"><span class="nm">1.</span><span class="cl">Rav Acha bar Yakov:</span> He forbade, and I permit!</p>

<p class="bas indent1"><span class="nm">(f)</span>If they are maternal but not paternal brothers, all agree that they are forbidden;</p>
<p class="bas indent1"><span class="nm">(g)</span>They argue about brothers from the mother and father.</p>
<p class="bas indent2"><span class="nm">1.</span>Rav Acha bar Yakov permits, since people view them as paternal brothers. They call them the sons of Ploni;</p>

<p class="bas indent1"><span class="nm">(h)</span><span class="cl">Version #2:</span> Rav Acha bar Yakov permits in all cases, even when they are only maternal brothers.</p>
<p class="bas indent1"><span class="nm">(i)</span><span class="cl">Question:</span> What is the reason?</p>
<p class="bas indent1"><span class="nm">(j)</span><span class="cl">Answer:</span> A convert is like a newborn baby.</p>

<p class="bas indent1"><span class="nm">(l)</span><span class="cl">Answer:</span> No, it is because Chalitzah and Yibum do not apply. Their widows are free to marry strangers, or the brothers.</p>

<p class="bas indent2"><span class="nm">1.</span><span class="cl">Version #1:</span> We understand if each man is forbidden to his brother's wife.
