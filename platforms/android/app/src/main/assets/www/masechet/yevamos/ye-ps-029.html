<div class="subject"><span class="nm">1)</span><p>SISTERS WHO FALL TO <i>YIBUM</i> TOGETHER (cont.)</p></div>
<div class="indent1"><span class="nm">(a)</span><p><span class="cl">(Mishnah):</span> If one is forbidden by an Isur Mitzvah or Kedushah... (they do Chalitzah, but not Yibum).</p></div>
<div class="indent1"><span class="nm">(b)</span><p><span class="cl">Question:</span> R. Shimon said that sisters do not do Chalitzah or Yibum!</p></div>
<div class="indent1"><span class="nm">(c)</span><p><span class="cl">Answer:</span> It is a decree that they do Chalitzah, due to Isurei Mitzvah or Isurei Kedushah who fall without a sister.</p></div>
<div class="indent1"><span class="nm">(d)</span><p><span class="cl">Question:</span> This explains why the one forbidden (Isur Mitzvah or Kedushah) needs Chalitzah. Why does her sister also need Chalitzah?</p></div>
<div class="indent1"><span class="nm">(e)</span><p><span class="cl">Answer:</span> We decree about her sister due to her (lest people think that also she does not need Chalitzah).</p></div>
<div class="indent1"><span class="nm">(f)</span><p><span class="cl">Question:</span> Regarding Ervah, we do not decree!</p></div>
<div class="indent1"><span class="nm">(g)</span><p><span class="cl">Answer:</span> Ervah is well known.</p></div>
<div class="subject"><span class="nm">2)</span><p>WHAT DOES MA'AMAR DO?</p></div>
<div class="indent1"><span class="nm">(a)</span><p><span class="cl">(Mishnah):</span> Reuven and Shimon were married to Rachel and Leah (sisters); Levi (another brother) was single. Reuven died, Levi gave a Ma'amar to Rachel, and then Shimon died;</p></div>
<div class="indent1"><span class="nm">(b)</span><p>Beis Shamai say, Levi keeps his wife (Rachel). Leah is Achos Ishto (she does not need even Chalitzah);</p></div>
<div class="indent1"><span class="nm">(c)</span><p>Beis Hillel say, he sends his wife away with a Get and Chalitzah, and does Chalitzah to Leah.</p></div>
<div class="indent2"><span class="nm">1.</span><p>In this case, they said 'Woe to him! He loses his wife and his brother's wife.'</p></div>
<div class="indent1"><span class="nm">(d)</span><p><span class="cl">(Gemara) Question:</span> What case does <i>this</i> come to exclude?</p></div>
<div class="indent1"><span class="nm">(e)</span><p><span class="cl">Answer:</span> This teaches unlike R. Yehoshua (109a. If a man was married mid'Rabanan to Leah, an orphaned minor, and her sister fell to him to Yibum mid'Oraisa, R. Yehoshua says, he cannot keep either one.)</p></div>
<div class="indent2"><span class="nm">1.</span><p>Rather, we follow R. Eliezer (we counsel Leah to do Mi'un) or R. Gamliel (if Leah does not do Mi'un, when she matures her marriage becomes mid'Oraisa, and the Yevamah is exempt even from Chalitzah, for she is Achos Ishto).</p></div>
<div class="indent1"><span class="nm">(f)</span><p><span class="cl">Version #1 (R. Elazar):</span> Do not say that Beis Shamai hold that a Ma'amar totally acquires a Yevamah, and afterwards he can divorce her with a Get (without Chalitzah);</p></div>
<div class="indent2"><span class="nm">1.</span><p>Rather, a Ma'amar acquires only to dispel the Tzarah (so Rachel will not be considered Achos Zekukaso).</p></div>
<div class="indent1"><span class="nm">(g)</span><p><span class="cl">Support (R. Avin - Mishnah (26a) - Beis Shamai):</span> If they both did Yibum, they may remain married.</p></div>
<div class="indent2"><span class="nm">1.</span><p>This is only b'Di'eved.</p></div>
<div class="bbbline">29b----------------------------------------29b</p></div>
<div class="indent2"><span class="nm">2.</span><p>If Ma'amar totally acquires, each brother may give a Ma'amar to a Yevamah and acquire her l'Chatchilah!</p></div>
<div class="indent1"><span class="nm">(h)</span><p><span class="cl">Objection:</span> Even if Ma'amar only dispels the Tzarah, this is difficult! Each brother can give a Ma'amar to a Yevamah and dismiss her Tzarah, permitting Yibum l'Chatchilah!</p></div>
<div class="indent2"><span class="nm">1.</span><p>You must say that only a Ma'amar of Heter dispels the Tzarah, but not a Ma'amar of Isur (e.g. to Achos Zekukaso);</p></div>
<div class="indent2"><span class="nm">2.</span><p>Likewise, only a Ma'amar of Heter totally acquires, but not a Ma'amar of Heter!</p></div>
<div class="indent1"><span class="nm">(i)</span><p><span class="cl">Version #2 - Rav Ashi (R. Elazar):</span> Do not say that Beis Shamai hold that a Ma'amar totally dispels, and the Tzarah does not need even Chalitzah. Rather, Ma'amar dispels partially.</p></div>
<div class="indent1"><span class="nm">(j)</span><p><span class="cl">Support (R. Avin - Mishnah - Beis Shamai):</span> If they both did Yibum, they may remain married.</p></div>
<div class="indent2"><span class="nm">1.</span><p>This is only b'Di'eved. If Ma'amar totally dispels, each brother may give a Ma'amar to a Yevamah and dispel her Tzarah, to allow Yibum l'Chatchilah!</p></div>
<div class="indent1"><span class="nm">(k)</span><p><span class="cl">Objection:</span> In our Mishnah, Beis Shamai says that since he gave a Ma'amar, when her sister falls she is exempt due to Achos Ishto!</p></div>
<div class="indent2"><span class="nm">1.</span><p>You must say that Ma'amar fully dispels the Tzarah only if the Yevamah could do even Yibum.</p></div>
<div class="subject"><span class="nm">3)</span><p>DOES MA'AMAR MAKE KIDUSHIN OR NISU'IN?</p></div>
<div class="indent1"><span class="nm">(a)</span><p><span class="cl">Question (Rava):</span> According to Beis Shamai, does Ma'amar make Kidushin or Nisu'in?</p></div>
<div class="indent2"><span class="nm">1.</span><p><span class="cl">Question (Abaye):</span> What difference does it make?</p></div>
<div class="indent2"><span class="nm">2.</span><p><span class="cl">Answer #1:</span> If it makes Nisu'in, he inherits her, must become Tamei to bury her, and can annul her vows.</p></div>
<div class="indent2"><span class="nm">3.</span><p><span class="cl">Rejection (R. Chiya's Beraisa):</span> If an Arusah (a wife during Kidushin) died, her husband is not an Onen (forbidden to Kodshim mid'Oraisa that day, and exempt from Mitzvos until burial) over her. He may (or need) not become Tamei for her, and he does not inherit her. If he died, she is not an Onenes over him and need not become Tamei for him. She collects a Kesuvah.</p></div>
<div class="indent3"><span class="nm">i.</span><p>If he only gave her a Ma'amar (which is only mid'Rabanan), all the more so he does not inherit or become Tamei for her!</p></div>
<div class="indent2"><span class="nm">4.</span><p><span class="cl">Answer #2:</span> If Ma'amar makes Kidushin, she must be given over (willingly) to Chupah. If it makes Nisu'in, she need not.</p></div>
<div class="indent2"><span class="nm">5.</span><p><span class="cl">Objection:</span> Without a Ma'amar, the Torah permits Yibum against her will - "Yevamah Yavo Aleha". Surely a Ma'amar does not change this!</p></div>
<div class="indent2"><span class="nm">6.</span><p><span class="cl">Answer (Rava):</span> Indeed, perhaps a Ma'amar changes this! When he gives a Ma'amar, the Zikah of Yibum departs, and she is like an Arusah (awaiting Nisu'in).</p></div>
<div class="indent1"><span class="nm">(b)</span><p><span class="cl">Answer (Beraisa - R. Eliezer):</span> A Yavam can annul the vows of a Yevamah, whether there are one or two Yevamim;</p></div>
<div class="indent2"><span class="nm">1.</span><p>R. Yehoshua says, he can annul if there is one Yavam, but not if there are two;</p></div>
<div class="indent2"><span class="nm">2.</span><p>R. Akiva says, even if there is one Yavam he cannot.</p></div>
<div class="indent2"><span class="nm">3.</span><p><span class="cl">Question:</span> Granted, R. Akiva holds that Ein Zikah even when there is one Yavam, and R. Yehoshua holds that Yesh Zikah when there is one Yavam, but not when there are two;</p></div>
<div class="indent3"><span class="nm">i.</span><p>However, how could R. Eliezer hold that Yesh Zikah when there are two Yevamim? (We cannot consider her to be Mekudeshes to both!)</p></div>
<div class="indent2"><span class="nm">4.</span><p><span class="cl">Answer (R. Ami):</span> The case is, he gave a Ma'amar. He holdsa like Beis Shamai, who say that a Ma'amar acquires totally.</p></div>
<div class="indent2"><span class="nm">5.</span><p><span class="cl">Summation of answer:</span> If Ma'amar makes Nisu'in, this explains why he can annul her vows. However, if it makes only Kidushin why can he?!</p></div>
<div class="indent3"><span class="nm">i.</span><p><span class="cl">(Mishnah):</span> The father and husband of a Na'arah Me'orasah (together) can annul her vows.</p></div>
<div class="indent1"><span class="nm">(c)</span><p><span class="cl">Rejection (Rav Nachman bar Yitzchak):</span> (Perhaps Ma'amar makes Kidushin.) R. Eliezer said that he can annul her vows, i.e. together with her father!</p></div>
<div class="indent1"><span class="nm">(d)</span><p><span class="cl">Question:</span> According to R. Elazar, who says that Ma'amar only dismisses the Tzarah, why can he annul in partnership?</p></div>
<div class="indent1"><span class="nm">(e)</span><p><span class="cl">Answer #1:</span> R. Elazar meant that Ma'amar does not fully acquire regarding Zikas Yibum. If he will not do Yibum, Chalitzah is required. He could agree that it acquires totally regarding vows!</p></div>
<div class="indent1"><span class="nm">(f)</span><p><span class="cl">Answer #2 - Counter-question:</span> Rav Nachman bar Yitzchak says that the Yavam and father annul together. However, the Beraisa says 'he annuls', not 'they annul'!</p></div>
<div class="indent2"><span class="nm">1.</span><p><span class="cl">Answer:</span> You must say that she took him to Beis Din (because he did not want to do Yibum nor Chalitzah), and Beis Din obligated him to feed her;</p></div>
<div class="indent2"><span class="nm">2.</span><p><span class="cl">(Rav Pinchas):</span> A woman vows on condition that her husband will approve. (Here, since the Yavam feeds her, she vows on condition that he will approve.)</p></div>
