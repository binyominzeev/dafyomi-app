<p class="bas indent1"><span class="nm">(a)</span><span class="cl">(Rava Bar Machsiya):</span> If the roofs in a city are taller than the synagogue, in the end it will be destroyed - "Leromem Es Beis Elokeinu u'Lha'amid Es Charvosav";</p>
<p class="bas indent2"><span class="nm">1.</span>This is only if the houses are taller - we are not concerned for buildings and towers (made for beauty).</p>
<p class="bas indent1"><span class="nm">(b)</span><span class="cl">Rav Ashi:</span> I caused that Masa Machsya (my city) will not be destroyed.</p>
<p class="bas indent1"><span class="nm">(c)</span><span class="cl">Question:</span> It was destroyed!</p>
<p class="bas indent1"><span class="nm">(d)</span><span class="cl">Answer:</span> It was not destroyed on account of houses being taller than the synagogue.</p>
<p class="bas indent1"><span class="nm">(e)</span><span class="cl">(Rava Bar Machsiya):</span> It is better to be under (subservient to) a Yishmaeli than under a Nochri (of Edom, they are worse);</p>
<p class="bas indent2"><span class="nm">1.</span>It is better to be under a Nochri than under a Chaver (Rashi - a nation descended from Persians; Tosfos - they lived in Bavel);</p>
<p class="bas indent2"><span class="nm">2.</span>It is better to be under a Chaver than under a Chacham (a disgrace to a Chacham is a disgrace to Torah, it must be avenged - a Chacham who does not take vengeance like a snake is not a Chacham (Yoma 22B));</p>
<p class="bas indent2"><span class="nm">3.</span>It is better to be under a Chacham than under an orphan or widow (they are prone to cry if afflicted, "Yitz'ak Elai...; V'Haragti Eschem" - Shemos 22:22-23).</p>
<p class="bas indent1"><span class="nm">(f)</span><span class="cl">(Rava Bar Machsiya):</span> The worst sickness is of the intestines, the worst [protracted] pain is of the heart, the worst [temporary] pain is of the head, the worst evil is an evil wife.</p>
<p class="bas indent1"><span class="nm">(g)</span><span class="cl">(Rava Bar Machsiya):</span> The kingdom must have so many things in mind, they could not be written down even if all the seas were ink, and all the swamps quills, and Shamayim was parchments, and all people were scribes.</p>
<p class="bas indent1"><span class="nm">(h)</span><span class="cl">(Rav Mesharshiya):</span> He learns from "Shamayim la'Rom va'Eretz l'Omek v'Lev Melachim Ein Cheker".</p>
<p class="bas indent1"><span class="nm">(i)</span><span class="cl">(Rava Bar Machsiya):</span> A fast helps for [annulling harsh decrees in] a dream like fire consumes stubble.</p>
<p class="bas indent1"><span class="nm">(j)</span><span class="cl">(Rav Chisda):</span> The fast must be the same day as the dream.</p>
<p class="bas indent1"><span class="nm">(k)</span><span class="cl">(Rav Yosef):</span> One may fast [on account of a dream] even on Shabbos [even though it is normally forbidden to fast on Shabbos].</p>
<p class="bas indent1"><span class="nm">(l)</span>R. Yehoshua brei d'Rav Idi came to Rav Ashi's house, they prepared for him an Eglah Tilsa (a healthy calf - alternatively, it was born third to its mother; or was a third of its ultimate growth).</p>
<p class="bas indent2"><span class="nm">1.</span><span class="cl">R. Yehoshua:</span> I am fasting today.</p>
<p class="bas indent2"><span class="nm">2.</span><span class="cl">Rav Ashi's household:</span> Rav Yehudah taught that one may borrow (eat on a day he intended to fast) and repay later!</p>
<p class="bas indent2"><span class="nm">3.</span><span class="cl">R. Yehoshua:</span> I am fasting on account of a dream - this helps like fire for [consuming] stubble, but it must be the same day as the dream, even on Shabbos.</p>
<p class="bas subject"><span class="nm">2)</span>WHO STOPS FOR PRAYER?</p>
<p class="bas indent1"><span class="nm">(a)</span><span class="cl">(Mishnah):</span> If one began [any of these activities before praying Minchah], he need not stop; we stop to say Shma [but not for prayer].</p>
<p class="bas indent1"><span class="nm">(b)</span><span class="cl">Question:</span> Why does the Mishnah repeat 'We do not stop for prayer'?</p>
<p class="bas indent1"><span class="nm">(c)</span><span class="cl">Answer:</span> The repetition refers to Torah:</p>
<p class="bas indent2"><span class="nm">1.</span><span class="cl">(Beraisa):</span> If Chachamim were engaging in Torah, they stop to say Shma, but not for prayer.</p>
<p class="bas indent1"><span class="nm">(d)</span><span class="cl">(R. Yochanan):</span> This applies only to Chachamim like R. Shimon, who engage in Torah and nothing else - but people like us stop even for prayer.</p>
<p class="bas indent1"><span class="nm">(e)</span><span class="cl">Question (Beraisa):</span> Just like we do not stop for prayer, we do not stop for Shma.</p>
<p class="bas indent1"><span class="nm">(f)</span><span class="cl">Answer:</span> That refers to judges deciding whether or not to Me'aber (and a month to) the year.</p>
<p class="bas indent2"><span class="nm">1.</span><span class="cl">(R. Eliezer bar Tzadok):</span> When we engaged in Ibur Shanah in Yavneh, we did not stop for Shma nor for prayer.</p>
<p class="bas subject"><span class="nm">3)</span>DO WE DECREE ON ACCOUNT OF <i>MID'RABANAN</i> LAWS?</p>
<p class="bas indent1"><span class="nm">(a)</span><span class="cl">(Mishnah):</span> Shortly before dark on Erev Shabbos, a tailor may not go outside with his needle (this informs people that he is a tailor), nor a scribe with his quill, lest he will forget and come to carry it on Shabbos;</p>
<p class="bas indent1"><span class="nm">(b)</span>One may not delouse clothing nor read by light of a lamp;</p>
<p class="bas indent1"><span class="nm">(c)</span>However, a teacher of children may look at where they are reading [by light of a lamp], but he himself may not read.</p>
<p class="bas indent1"><span class="nm">(d)</span>Similarly, a Zav may not eat with a Zavah lest they come to have relations (this will be explained).</p>
<p class="bas indent1"><span class="nm">(e)</span><span class="cl">(Gemara - Mishnah):</span> One may not stand in Reshus ha'Yachid and [stick out his mouth and] drink in Reshus ha'Rabim, or vice-versa (lest he bring the cup into the Reshus he stands in, he would be liable for this);</p>
<p class="bas indent2"><span class="nm">1.</span>If most of his head and body are in the Reshus in which he drinks, it is permitted.</p>
<p class="bas bbbline">11b----------------------------------------11b</p>
<p class="bas indent1"><span class="nm">(f)</span>The same applies to a winepress (this will be explained).</p>
<p class="bas indent1"><span class="nm">(g)</span><span class="cl">Question:</span> May one stand in Reshus ha'Yachid or Reshus ha'Rabim and drink in Karmelis?</p>
<p class="bas indent1"><span class="nm">(h)</span><span class="cl">Answer #1 (Abaye):</span> The same decree applies to Karmelis.</p>
<p class="bas indent1"><span class="nm">(i)</span><span class="cl">Answer #2 (Rava):</span> The Isur of [transferring to or from a] Karmelis is only mid'Rabanan - Chachamim do not decree lest one will come to transgress an Isur mid'Rabanan.</p>
<p class="bas indent1"><span class="nm">(j)</span><span class="cl">Support (Abaye, for himself - Mishnah):</span> The same applies to a winepress.</p>
<p class="bas indent2"><span class="nm">1.</span><span class="cl">Question:</span> What kind of winepress is discussed?</p>
<p class="bas indent3"><span class="nm">i.</span>It is not a Reshus ha'Yachid or Reshus ha'Rabim, the Mishnah already taught these!</p>
<p class="bas indent2"><span class="nm">2.</span><span class="cl">Answer:</span> It is a Karmelis.</p>
<p class="bas indent1"><span class="nm">(k)</span><span class="cl">Rejection (Rava):</span> No, the Mishnah teaches about a winepress regarding Ma'aser (one may drink in the winepress [before the wine descends to the pit, for then it is finished] without tithing, for this is Arai (haphazard), even if he stands outside; if he takes the wine outside, he must tithe before drinking):</p>
<p class="bas indent2"><span class="nm">1.</span><span class="cl">(Mishnah - R. Meir):</span> One who drinks in a winepress is exempt from Ma'aser, whether it was mixed with hot or cold water (wine used to be very strong, it was normal to dilute them with water);</p>
<p class="bas indent2"><span class="nm">2.</span>R. Eliezer bar Tzadok obligates;</p>
<p class="bas indent2"><span class="nm">3.</span>Chachamim exempt regarding [diluting with] cold [water], for he could return the leftovers [to the remaining wine]; they obligate regarding hot (he would not return it, lest it spoil the other wine - it is as if he removed the wine from the winepress).</p>
<p class="bas indent1"><span class="nm">(l)</span><span class="cl">Support (for Abaye - Mishnah):</span> A tailor may not go outside with his needle shortly before dark, lest he will forget and will carry it on Shabbos.</p>
<p class="bas indent2"><span class="nm">1.</span><span class="cl">Suggestion:</span> It is inserted in his garment. (It is not normal to carry this way, it is forbidden only mid'Rabanan - nevertheless we decree on Erev Shabbos, lest he will transgress a mid'Rabanan law on Shabbos!)</p>
<p class="bas indent1"><span class="nm">(m)</span><span class="cl">Rejection:</span> No, it is in his hand.</p>
<p class="bas indent1"><span class="nm">(n)</span><span class="cl">Support (for Abaye - Beraisa #1):</span> A tailor may not go outside with his needle inserted in his garment.</p>
<p class="bas indent2"><span class="nm">1.</span><span class="cl">Suggestion:</span> This is forbidden on Erev Shabbos (lest he will carry it like this on Shabbos)!</p>
<p class="bas indent1"><span class="nm">(o)</span><span class="cl">Rejection:</span> No, it is forbidden only on Shabbos itself.</p>
<p class="bas indent1"><span class="nm">(p)</span><span class="cl">Objection (Beraisa #2):</span> A tailor may not go outside with his needle inserted in his garment on Erev Shabbos close to dark.</p>
<p class="bas indent1"><span class="nm">(q)</span><span class="cl">Answer:</span> Beraisa #2 is R. Yehudah, who obligates a craftsman in such cases (but we do not decree on account of mid'Rabanan laws).</p>
<p class="bas indent2"><span class="nm">1.</span><span class="cl">(Beraisa - R. Meir):</span> On Shabbos, a tailor may not go outside with his needle inserted in his garment, nor a carpenter with a ruler on his ear, nor a fuller (one who cleans and thickens cloth) with a string on his ear, nor a weaver with a tuft on his ear, nor a dyer with a sample [of different colors of dyed wool] around his neck, nor a moneychanger with a coin in his ear;</p>
<p class="bas indent3"><span class="nm">i.</span>If he did, he is exempt;</p>
<p class="bas indent2"><span class="nm">2.</span>R. Yehudah says, a craftsman who carries something like people of his trade is liable (for it is normal for him to carry this way), anyone else is exempt (it is abnormal for him).</p>
<p class="bas subject"><span class="nm">4)</span>WEARING A POUCH</p>
<p class="bas indent1"><span class="nm">(a)</span><span class="cl">(Beraisa #1):</span> A Zav may not walk [in Reshus ha'Rabim on Shabbos] with a pouch [to catch emissions from his Ever] - if he did, he is exempt;</p>
<p class="bas indent1"><span class="nm">(b)</span><span class="cl">Contradiction (Beraisa #2):</span> If he did so [b'Shogeg], he brings a Chatas.</p>
<p class="bas indent1"><span class="nm">(c)</span><span class="cl">Answer #1 (Rav Yosef):</span> Beraisa #1 is R. Meir, Beraisa #2 is R. Yehudah.</p>
<p class="bas indent1"><span class="nm">(d)</span><span class="cl">Objection (Abaye):</span> We know that R. Meir exempts something carried abnormally - we have no source that he exempts for something carried normally!</p>
<p class="bas indent1"><span class="nm">(e)</span><span class="cl">Support:</span> If not, will you say that he exempts a non-craftsman who carved out a [receptacle holding a] Kav in a log on Shabbos [just because he is not a craftsman, and does it unprofessionally]?</p>
<p class="bas indent1"><span class="nm">(f)</span><span class="cl">Answer #2 (Rav Hamnuna):</span> Beraisa #1 discusses a Zav who already had three emissions, Beraisa #2 discusses a Zav who had only two emissions so far.</p>
<p class="bas indent1"><span class="nm">(g)</span><span class="cl">Question:</span> A two-emission Zav is liable, for he needs to know whether or not he had a third emission [which would obligate him to bring a Korban, therefore it is normal for him to wear a pouch to collect emissions];</p>
<p class="bas indent2"><span class="nm">1.</span>Also a three-emission Zav should be liable, for he needs to know if he had an emission today, for his count (he needs seven clean days to become Tahor)!</p>
<p class="bas indent1"><span class="nm">(h)</span><span class="cl">Answer:</span> The case is, he already saw Zivah today (additional emissions today do not matter).</p>
