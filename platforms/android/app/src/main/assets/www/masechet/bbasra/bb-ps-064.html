<p class="bas subject"><span class="nm">1)</span>ACQUIRING THE HEIGHT AND DEPTH (cont.)</p>
<p class="bas indent1"><span class="nm">(a)</span><span class="cl">Support (for Rav Dimi - Mishnah):</span> The roof (is not included) if it has a Ma'akeh 10 Tefachim tall.</p>
<p class="bas indent2"><span class="nm">1.</span>If the depth and height are included even though he did not write them, even if it has a Ma'akeh of 10 Tefachim, it should be included!</p>
<p class="bas indent1"><span class="nm">(b)</span><span class="cl">Rejection:</span> A roof with a Ma'akeh 10 Tefachim tall is important, so it is not included.</p>
<p class="bas indent1"><span class="nm">(c)</span><span class="cl">(Ravina):</span> We may learn from (what Rav Papa said in) the above discussion!</p>
<p class="bas indent2"><span class="nm">1.</span><span class="cl">(Reish Lakish):</span> This (Beraisa of Ma'aser) teaches that if one sells a house and stipulates 'on condition that the top is mine', the top is his.</p>
<p class="bas indent2"><span class="nm">2.</span><span class="cl">Question:</span> What law do we learn from this?</p>
<p class="bas indent2"><span class="nm">3.</span><span class="cl">Answer #1 (Rav Zvid):</span> He may extend ledges from it.</p>
<p class="bas indent2"><span class="nm">4.</span><span class="cl">Answer #2 (Rav Papa):</span> He may build another story on top of it.</p>
<p class="bas indent2"><span class="nm">5.</span>If the depth and height are included in the sale when he did not write them, the seller would not need to write them!</p>
<p class="bas indent1"><span class="nm">(d)</span><span class="cl">Rejection (Rav Ashi):</span> He must write them to secure the right to rebuild it if it falls.</p>
<p class="bas subject"><span class="nm">2)</span>DOES ONE SELL GENEROUSLY OR STINGILY?</p>
<p class="bas indent1"><span class="nm">(a)</span><span class="cl">(Mishnah - R. Akiva):</span> If Reuven sold his house to Shimon; Shimon does not acquire the pit and cistern, even if Reuven wrote 'the depth and height';</p>
<p class="bas indent2"><span class="nm">1.</span>(If Reuven wants to use them) he must buy the rights to a path to them.</p>
<p class="bas indent1"><span class="nm">(b)</span>Chachamim say, (he may use them, and) he need not buy a path.</p>
<p class="bas indent1"><span class="nm">(c)</span>R. Akiva admits, if Reuven sold his house 'except for the pit and cistern', he need not buy a path.</p>
<p class="bas indent1"><span class="nm">(d)</span>R. Akiva says, if Reuven sold his house to Shimon, and the pit and cistern to Levi, Levi need not buy a path;</p>
<p class="bas indent1"><span class="nm">(e)</span>Chachamim say, he must buy a path.</p>
<p class="bas indent1"><span class="nm">(f)</span><span class="cl">(Gemara - Ravina) Question:</span> Why must the Mishnah teach both a pit and cistern?</p>
<p class="bas indent1"><span class="nm">(g)</span><span class="cl">Answer (Rava Tofa'ah - Beraisa):</span> A pit and cistern are essentially the same. A pit is merely a hole; a cistern is a building (of stones) inside a pit.</p>
<p class="bas indent1"><span class="nm">(h)</span><span class="cl">(Mishnah - R. Akiva):</span> Reuven must buy a path;</p>
<p class="bas indent1"><span class="nm">(i)</span>Chachamim say, he need not...</p>
<p class="bas indent1"><span class="nm">(j)</span><span class="cl">Suggestion:</span> R. Akiva holds that one sells generously (he does not retain a path for himself), and Chachamim hold that one sells stingily.</p>
<p class="bas bbbline">64b----------------------------------------64b</p>
<p class="bas indent2"><span class="nm">1.</span>In many places, we say that R. Akiva holds like this. Our Mishnah is the source!</p>
<p class="bas indent1"><span class="nm">(k)</span><span class="cl">Rejection:</span> Perhaps R. Akiva holds that one does not pay for a house on condition that others will have rights to walk through it (therefore we assume that the seller did not retain a path);</p>
<p class="bas indent2"><span class="nm">1.</span>Chachamim hold that (a seller) would not take money and lose all access to his property (that he retained).</p>
<p class="bas indent1"><span class="nm">(l)</span><span class="cl">Suggestion:</span> From the Seifa, we may derive their opinions about selling generously or stingily.</p>
<p class="bas indent2"><span class="nm">1.</span><span class="cl">(Seifa - R. Akiva):</span> If Reuven sold his house to Shimon, and the pit and cistern to Levi, Levi need not buy a path;</p>
<p class="bas indent2"><span class="nm">2.</span>Chachamim say, he must buy a path.</p>
<p class="bas indent1"><span class="nm">(m)</span><span class="cl">Rejection:</span> Perhaps R. Akiva holds that (Levi's) objection to not having access to his pit overrides (Shimon's) objection to people walking through his house (therefore, Reuven gives Levi a path), and Chachamim hold the opposite.</p>
<p class="bas indent1"><span class="nm">(n)</span><span class="cl">Suggestion:</span> We may derive their positions from another Mishnah.</p>
<p class="bas indent2"><span class="nm">1.</span><span class="cl">(Mishnah - R. Akiva):</span> One who sells a field does not sell the pit, winery or dovecote, whether these are barren or full. He must buy a path to them;</p>
<p class="bas indent2"><span class="nm">2.</span>Chachamim say, he need not buy a path.</p>
<p class="bas indent2"><span class="nm">3.</span><span class="cl">Question:</span> If their reasons are like above (one's insistence that others not walk through his property, or having access to his property), we already know this from our Mishnah. Why was the argument repeated?</p>
<p class="bas indent2"><span class="nm">4.</span><span class="cl">Answer:</span> Rather, we must say that R. Akiva holds that one sells generously, and Chachamim hold that one sells stingily.</p>
<p class="bas indent1"><span class="nm">(o)</span><span class="cl">Rejection:</span> Perhaps we must teach the argument about a house and about a field;</p>
<p class="bas indent2"><span class="nm">1.</span>Had we taught only about a house, one might have thought that only in a house (R. Akiva says that) privacy (of the buyer) is the greater concern;</p>
<p class="bas indent2"><span class="nm">2.</span>Had we taught only about a field, one might have thought that only there (R. Akiva says that the seller does not keep a path because) trampling on the field harms the field.</p>
<p class="bas indent1"><span class="nm">(p)</span>Rather, we may derive their positions from the Seifa;</p>
<p class="bas indent2"><span class="nm">1.</span><span class="cl">(Seifa - R. Akiva):</span> If Reuven sold his field to Shimon, and the pit, winery or dovecote to Levi, Levi need not buy a path;</p>
<p class="bas indent2"><span class="nm">2.</span>Chachamim say, he must buy a path.</p>
<p class="bas indent2"><span class="nm">3.</span><span class="cl">Question:</span> If their reasons are like above (they argue about which is stronger, one's insistence that others not walk through his property, or having access to his property), we already know this from the Seifa of our Mishnah. Why was this repeated?</p>
<p class="bas indent2"><span class="nm">4.</span><span class="cl">Answer:</span> We conclude that R. Akiva holds that one sells generously, and Chachamim hold that one sells stingily.</p>
