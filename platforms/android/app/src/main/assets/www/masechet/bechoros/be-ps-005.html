<p class="bas indent1"><span class="nm">(a)</span><span class="cl">Question:</span> We understand Reish Lakish. (He learns from "v'Hayah Chi Yevi'acha... v'Ha'avarta");</p>
<p class="bas indent2"><span class="nm">1.</span>However, what is R. Yochanan's reason?</p>
<p class="bas indent1"><span class="nm">(b)</span><span class="cl">R. Elazar:</span> I saw R. Yochanan in a dream. Surely, I will give a good reason!</p>
<p class="bas indent1"><span class="nm">(c)</span><span class="cl">Answer (R. Elazar):</span> "Li Yihyu" - they will remain in their current status. (Kidush Bechoros will never cease.)</p>
<p class="bas indent1"><span class="nm">(d)</span><span class="cl">Question:</span> How does R. Yochanan expound "v'Hayah Chi Yevi'acha... v'Ha'avarta"?</p>
<p class="bas indent1"><span class="nm">(e)</span><span class="cl">Answer:</span> He expounds like R. Yishmael:</p>
<p class="bas indent2"><span class="nm">1.</span><span class="cl">(Beraisa - Tana d'Vei R. Yishmael):</span> Doing this Mitzvah will entitle Bnei Yisrael to enter Eretz Yisrael.</p>
<p class="bas indent1"><span class="nm">(f)</span><span class="cl">Version #3 - Rav Mordechai:</span> We learned the argument of R. Yochanan and Reish Lakish just the contrary. R. Yochanan says that they were not Mekadesh Bechoros in the Midbar, and Reish Lakish says that they were!</p>
<p class="bas indent1"><span class="nm">(g)</span><span class="cl">Rav Ashi:</span> Do you learn the questions oppositely? Did R. Elazar explain Reish Lakish, and see him in a dream? (R. Elazar was a Talmid of R. Yochanan!)</p>
<p class="bas indent1"><span class="nm">(h)</span><span class="cl">Rav Mordechai:</span> R. Yochanan means that they did not need to Mekadesh Bechoros in the Midbar (in order to be Makriv them, for they became Kodesh automatically). Reish Lakish says that (they were Chulin, so) they had to be Mekadesh them.</p>
<p class="bas indent1"><span class="nm">(i)</span><span class="cl">Rav Ashi:</span> This is like we learned!</p>
<p class="bas indent2"><span class="nm">1.</span>Even though there is no Halachic difference, Rav Mordechai taught the argument in different words, for one must use the same words that his Rebbi used.</p>
<p class="bas subject"><span class="nm">2)</span>THE SILVER GIVEN FOR THE <i>MISHKAN</i></p>
<p class="bas indent1"><span class="nm">(a)</span><span class="cl">Question (a Nochri officer):</span> If one adds up the number of Leviyim who descended from each son of Levi, we find a total of 22,300. However, a verse says that there were only 22,000 in all. What happened to the other 300?!</p>
<p class="bas indent1"><span class="nm">(b)</span><span class="cl">Answer (R. Yochanan ben Zakai):</span> They were Bechoros. Only the 22,000 Leviyim who were not Bechoros exempted Bechorei Yisrael from redemption.</p>
<p class="bas indent1"><span class="nm">(c)</span><span class="cl">Question:</span> What is the reason?</p>
<p class="bas indent1"><span class="nm">(d)</span><span class="cl">Answer (Abaye):</span> It is enough that a Bechor exempts himself. He cannot exempt someone else as well.</p>
<p class="bas indent1"><span class="nm">(e)</span><span class="cl">Question (the officer):</span> Each of 603,550 Yisraelim gave "Beka (half a Shekel) la'Gulgoles" for the Mishkan. This is a total of 201 Kikarim and 11 Manos (a Maneh is 25 Shekalim, a Kikar is 60 Manos);</p>
<p class="bas indent2"><span class="nm">1.</span>Only 100 Kikarim were used in the Mishkan. "Me'as Kikar ha'Kesef Latzekes" (one for each socket);</p>
<p class="bas indent2"><span class="nm">2.</span>Your Rebbi Moshe was a thief, dice player (he pocketed money to pay gambling debts) or could not do arithmetic. He kept over half, and returned (for the Mishkan) less than half!</p>
<p class="bas indent1"><span class="nm">(f)</span><span class="cl">Answer (R. Yochanan ben Zakai):</span> He was a faithful treasurer. He did not err. The Maneh of Hekdesh is double a standard Maneh (also the Kikar of Hekdesh is double.)</p>
<p class="bas indent1"><span class="nm">(g)</span><span class="cl">Question (Rav Achai):</span> What was the officer's question? "Me'as Kikar ha'Kesef Latzekes" implies that the rest was put in the treasury of Hekdesh!</p>
<p class="bas indent1"><span class="nm">(h)</span><span class="cl">Answer:</span> It also says "v'Chesef Pekudei ha'Edah Me'as Kikar."</p>
<p class="bas indent1"><span class="nm">(i)</span><span class="cl">Question:</span> What is R. Yochanan ben Zakai's source to say that the Maneh of Hekdesh is double?</p>
<p class="bas indent1"><span class="nm">(j)</span><span class="cl">Answer #1:</span> There were 71 (regular) Manos above the 100 Kikar. The Torah calls this 1775 Shekalim. If the Maneh (and Kikar) of Hekdesh were like of Chulin, it would have called the excess a Kikar and (275 Shekalim, which is) 11 Manos!</p>
<p class="bas indent1"><span class="nm">(k)</span><span class="cl">Rejection:</span> Perhaps the Torah counts only 'round' numbers of Kikarim (e.g. 100), but not units (a lone Kikar)!</p>
<p class="bas indent1"><span class="nm">(l)</span><span class="cl">Answer #2:</span> The Torah calls the amount of copper "Shiv'im Kikar and 2400 Shekalim." If the Maneh of Hekdesh were not double, it would have called the 2400 Shekalim 'a Kikar and (900 Shekalim, i.e.) 36 Manos!'</p>
<p class="bas indent1"><span class="nm">(m)</span><span class="cl">Rejection:</span> Perhaps the Torah combines Shekalim into Kikarim only if it amounts to a 'round' number of Kikarim (e.g. a multiple of 10)!</p>
<p class="bas indent1"><span class="nm">(n)</span><span class="cl">Answer #3 (Rav Chisda):</span> He learns from "Esrim Shekalim Chamishah v'Esrim Shekalim Asarah va'Chamishah Shekel ha'Maneh Yihyeh Lachem";</p>
<p class="bas bbbline">5b----------------------------------------5b</p>
<p class="bas indent2"><span class="nm">1.</span><span class="cl">Question:</span> A Maneh is (100 Dinarim,) not 240 (Dinarim, i.e. 60 Shekalim, i.e. 20 and 25 and 15)!</p>
<p class="bas indent2"><span class="nm">2.</span><span class="cl">Answer:</span> This teaches three things:</p>
<p class="bas indent3"><span class="nm">i.</span>The Maneh of Hekdesh is double a normal Maneh;</p>
<p class="bas indent3"><span class="nm">ii.</span>We may increase measures, but no more than a sixth. (A double Maneh was initially 200 Dinarim, and the verse considers it to be 240);</p>
<p class="bas indent3"><span class="nm">iii.</span>The sixth is "external". (The increase (40) is a sixth of the total (the new measure, 240. This equals a fifth of the old measure.)</p>
<p class="bas indent1"><span class="nm">(o)</span><span class="cl">Question (R. Chanina):</span> Why is Peter Chamor different than firstborn horses or camels?</p>
<p class="bas indent1"><span class="nm">(p)</span><span class="cl">Answer #1 (R. Elazar):</span> This is a Gezeras ha'Kasuv. (The Torah decreed. We do not know the reason.)</p>
<p class="bas indent1"><span class="nm">(q)</span><span class="cl">Answer #2 (R. Elazar):</span> This is because donkeys helped Bnei Yisrael carry wealth out of Mitzrayim. Everyone had at least 90 donkeys laden with gold and silver.</p>
<p class="bas subject"><span class="nm">3)</span>THE MEANING OF CERTAIN NAMES</p>
<p class="bas indent1"><span class="nm">(a)</span><span class="cl">Question (R. Chanina):</span> What is the meaning of "Refidim" (where Amalek attacked Yisrael)?</p>
<p class="bas indent1"><span class="nm">(b)</span><span class="cl">Answer (R. Elazar):</span> This is its name.</p>
<p class="bas indent1"><span class="nm">(c)</span>Tana'im argue like R. Chanina (who assumes that this was not its name) and R. Elazar;</p>
<p class="bas indent2"><span class="nm">1.</span><span class="cl">(Beraisa - R. Eliezer):</span> Refidim is its name.</p>
<p class="bas indent2"><span class="nm">2.</span>R. Yehoshua says, it is called Refidim because Bnei Yisrael Rifu (slackened) from Torah - "Lo Hifnu Avos El Banim mi'Rifyon Yadayim."</p>
<p class="bas indent1"><span class="nm">(d)</span><span class="cl">Question (R. Chanina):</span> What is the meaning of "Shitim" (where Benos Midyan enticed Bnei Yisrael)?</p>
<p class="bas indent1"><span class="nm">(e)</span><span class="cl">Answer (R. Elazar):</span> This is its name.</p>
<p class="bas indent1"><span class="nm">(f)</span>Tana'im argue like R. Chanina and R. Elazar;</p>
<p class="bas indent2"><span class="nm">1.</span><span class="cl">(Beraisa - R. Eliezer):</span> Shitim is its name.</p>
<p class="bas indent2"><span class="nm">2.</span>R. Yehoshua says, it is called Shitim because Bnei Yisrael engaged in Shetus (lunacy) there.</p>
<p class="bas indent1"><span class="nm">(g)</span><span class="cl">(R. Eliezer):</span> "<i>Va'Tikrena</i> la'Am l'Zivchei Eloheihen" - their very bodies (i.e. unclothed) came out to greet the Yisraelim.</p>
<p class="bas indent1"><span class="nm">(h)</span><span class="cl">(R. Yehoshua):</span> "Va'TiKRena" teaches that the Yisraelim had emissions of Keri (semen).</p>
<p class="bas subject"><span class="nm">4)</span>A NIDMEH</p>
<p class="bas indent1"><span class="nm">(a)</span><span class="cl">(Mishnah):</span> If a cow gave birth to (an animal that looks like) a donkey, or a donkey gave birth to a horse (Rosh's text - calf), it is exempt from Bechorah;</p>
<p class="bas indent2"><span class="nm">1.</span>It says "Peter Chamor" twice. The mother and baby must both be donkeys (for the Mitzvah to apply).</p>
<p class="bas indent1"><span class="nm">(b)</span><span class="cl">Question:</span> May these (Tosfos - it, the donkey born from a cow) be eaten?</p>
<p class="bas indent1"><span class="nm">(c)</span><span class="cl">Answer:</span> If a Tahor animal gave birth to a Tamei animal, it is permitted. If a Tamei animal gave birth to a Tahor animal, it is forbidden;</p>
<p class="bas indent2"><span class="nm">1.</span>What comes from something Tamei is Tamei. What comes from something Tahor is Tahor.</p>
<p class="bas indent1"><span class="nm">(d)</span><span class="cl">(Gemara - Mishnah):</span> If a sheep gave birth to a goat, or vice-versa, it is (a Nidmeh, it is) exempt from Bechorah;</p>
<p class="bas indent2"><span class="nm">1.</span>If the child resembles its mother in some ways, it has Kedushas Bechor.</p>
<p class="bas indent1"><span class="nm">(e)</span><span class="cl">Question:</span> What is the source of this?</p>
<p class="bas indent1"><span class="nm">(f)</span><span class="cl">Answer (Rav Yehudah):</span> "Ach Bechor Shor" - a calf has Kedushas Bechor only if it and its mother are cattle.</p>
<p class="bas indent2"><span class="nm">1.</span>"Vechor Kesev" and "Vechor Ez" teach that a lamb (or kid) has Kedushas Bechor only if it and its mother are sheep (or both goats).</p>
<p class="bas indent2"><span class="nm">2.</span><span class="cl">Suggestion:</span> Perhaps a Nidmeh has no Kedushas Bechor even if it resembles its mother in some ways!</p>
<p class="bas indent2"><span class="nm">3.</span><span class="cl">Rejection:</span> "Ach" limits (the exemption to the case when it has no resemblance. Alternatively, this is a second Mi'ut (exclusion). Two Mi'utim for the same matter always come to include it - Sefas Emes).</p>
<p class="bas indent1"><span class="nm">(g)</span><span class="cl">Question:</span> Our Tana (of the Mishnah) learns about a cow that gave birth to a Nidmeh from the repetition of "Peter"!</p>
<p class="bas indent1"><span class="nm">(h)</span><span class="cl">Answer:</span> Rav Yehudah explains according to R. Yosi ha'Gelili;</p>
<p class="bas indent2"><span class="nm">1.</span><span class="cl">(Beraisa - R. Yosi ha'Gelili):</span> "Ach Bechor Shor" teaches that a calf has Kedushas Bechor only if it and its mother are cattle. "Vechor Kesev" and "Vechor Ez" teach similarly about a lamb or kid.</p>
<p class="bas indent2"><span class="nm">2.</span><span class="cl">Suggestion:</span> Perhaps a Nidmeh has no Kedushas Bechor even if it resembles its mother in some ways!</p>
<p class="bas indent2"><span class="nm">3.</span><span class="cl">Rejection:</span> "Ach" limits the exemption.</p>
<p class="bas indent1"><span class="nm">(i)</span><span class="cl">Question:</span> What do the Tana'im argue about?</p>
<p class="bas indent1"><span class="nm">(j)</span><span class="cl">Answer:</span> Our Tana holds that a verse exempts a Nidmeh regarding (Peter Chamor, which is only Kedushas Damim), and the same applies to Kedushas ha'Guf (Bechoros of Tahor animals, which are Korbanos);</p>
<p class="bas indent2"><span class="nm">1.</span>R. Yosi holds that a verse exempts a Nidmeh regarding Kedushas ha'Guf, and the same applies to Kedushas Damim.</p>
<p class="bas indent1"><span class="nm">(k)</span><span class="cl">Question:</span> How does our Tana expound "Bechor (Kesev) Bechor (Ez)" in R. Yosi's verse?</p>
<p class="bas indent1"><span class="nm">(l)</span><span class="cl">Answer:</span> This teaches R. Yosi b'Rebbi Chanina's law:</p>
<p class="bas indent2"><span class="nm">1.</span><span class="cl">(R. Yosi b'Rebbi Chanina):</span> The Torah (wrote "Bechor" regarding each of the three kinds of Tahor Bechoros. It) explicitly commands Lehaktir (to burn on the Mizbe'ach) Eimurim (parts of animals offered from all Korbanos, e.g. the Chelev) of Bechoros of all of them. We could not have learned one from the others;</p>
<p class="bas indent2"><span class="nm">2.</span>Had the Torah taught only about a calf, we would have said that this is because it has larger Nesachim (six Lugim of wine. The Nesech for other Bechoros is only three Lugim);</p>
<p class="bas indent2"><span class="nm">3.</span>Had it taught only about a lamb, we would have said that this is because its tail is offered, unlike other Bechoros;</p>
<p class="bas indent2"><span class="nm">4.</span>Had it taught only about a goat, we would have said that this is because an individual who transgressed idolatry b'Shogeg must bring a goat for his Chatas.</p>
<p class="bas indent2"><span class="nm">5.</span><span class="cl">Suggestion:</span> True, we could not have learned one from any one of the others. Perhaps we could have learned one from the other two!</p>
<p class="bas indent2"><span class="nm">6.</span><span class="cl">Rejection - Question:</span> Which could be learned from the other two?</p>
<p class="bas indent3"><span class="nm">i.</span>We cannot learn a calf from the others, for they are Kosher for Korban Pesach;</p>
<p class="bas indent3"><span class="nm">ii.</span>We cannot learn a lamb from the others, for they are brought to atone for Helam Davar of idolatry;</p>
<p class="bas indent3"><span class="nm">iii.</span>We cannot learn a kid from the others, for more is offered on the Mizbe'ach for them (bigger Nesachim, or the tail) than for a kid.</p>
<p class="bas indent2"><span class="nm">7.</span><span class="cl">Conclusion:</span> The Torah must teach all of these.</p>
<p class="bas normal"></p>
<p class="bas indent1"><span class="nm">(m)</span><span class="cl">Implied question:</span> R. Yosi ha’Gelili [should agree with this! Why does he expound differently?]</p>
<p class="bas indent1"><span class="nm">(n)</span><span class="cl">Answer:</span> If so, it should have written 'Ach Bechor Shor Kesev v'Ez.' Why does it repeat Bechor [for each]? Rather, this teaches that it must be a Shor (look like cattle), and also its mother must be.</p>
