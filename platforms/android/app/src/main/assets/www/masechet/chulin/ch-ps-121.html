<div class="subject"><span class="nm">1)</span><p>THE TUMAH OF ALAL</p></div>
<div class="indent1"><span class="nm">(a)</span><p><span class="cl">(Mishnah):</span> And the Alal...</p></div>
<div class="indent1"><span class="nm">(b)</span><p><span class="cl">Question:</span> What is Alal?</p></div>
<div class="indent1"><span class="nm">(c)</span><p><span class="cl">Answer #1 (R. Yochanan):</span> It is Marteka (Tosfos - dead flesh; Rashi - the hard sinew of the neck and spinal cord).</p></div>
<div class="indent1"><span class="nm">(d)</span><p><span class="cl">Answer #2 (Reish Lakish):</span> It is meat that comes off the knife (and sticks to the skin) when flaying the animal.</p></div>
<div class="indent1"><span class="nm">(e)</span><p><span class="cl">Question:</span> "You speak falsity; you are Elil (vain) healers" implies that Alal cannot heal!</p></div>
<div class="indent2"><span class="nm">1.</span><p>Marteka cannot heal, but meat that comes off the knife can (be reconnected, and) heal!</p></div>
<div class="indent1"><span class="nm">(f)</span><p><span class="cl">Answer:</span> All agree that the verse discusses Marteka. They argue about Alal of our Mishnah.</p></div>
<div class="indent1"><span class="nm">(g)</span><p><span class="cl">(Mishnah - R. Yehudah):</span> If Alal is gathered together:</p></div>
<div class="indent2"><span class="nm">1.</span><p>If there is k'Zayis in one place, one is liable for it (for entering the Mikdash after touching it; Rashi - alternatively, for eating it);</p></div>
<div class="indent2"><span class="nm">2.</span><p><span class="cl">(Rav Huna):</span> This is only if an adult gathered it together.</p></div>
<div class="indent1"><span class="nm">(h)</span><p><span class="cl">Question:</span> Granted, if Alal is meat that comes off the knife, he is liable for a k'Zayis. (Since he gathered it, he shows that he is concerned for it, so it is not Batel);</p></div>
<div class="indent2"><span class="nm">1.</span><p>However, if it is Marteka, even if he gathers it, it is hard like wood. Why is it considered Nevelah?</p></div>
<div class="indent1"><span class="nm">(i)</span><p><span class="cl">Answer:</span> All agree that R. Yehudah discusses meat that comes off the knife. They argue according to the first Tana;</p></div>
<div class="indent2"><span class="nm">1.</span><p>R. Yochanan holds that even Marteka joins for the Shi'ur for Tum'ah. Reish Lakish holds that only meat that comes off the knife joins.</p></div>
<div class="indent1"><span class="nm">(j)</span><p><span class="cl">Question:</span> What is the case of meat that comes off the knife?</p></div>
<div class="indent2"><span class="nm">1.</span><p>If he planned to eat it, it should be Tamei by itself! (Chachamim say that it only joins for Tum'ah.)</p></div>
<div class="indent2"><span class="nm">2.</span><p>If he did not plan to eat it, it should be Batel, and considered like skin!</p></div>
<div class="indent1"><span class="nm">(k)</span><p><span class="cl">Answer #1 (R. Avin or R. Meisha):</span> He planned to eat only part of it. (He did not specify which. The amount he planned to eat joins for Tum'ah.)</p></div>
<div class="indent1"><span class="nm">(l)</span><p><span class="cl">Answer #2 (the other of R. Avin and R. Meisha):</span> (He did not plan to eat it.) Some meat sticks to the skin because a Chayah bit the animal. Other meat sticks due to the knife. (We are not sure which is which. The former is not Batel and joins for Tum'ah. The latter is Batel and does not join.)</p></div>
<div class="subject"><span class="nm">2)</span><p>OTHER PARTS THAT JOIN FOR TUM'AH</p></div>
<div class="indent1"><span class="nm">(a)</span><p><span class="cl">(Mishnah):</span> The beak and claws are Mekabel Tum'ah, Metamei, and join for Shi'ur for Tum'ah.</p></div>
<div class="indent1"><span class="nm">(b)</span><p><span class="cl">Question:</span> The beak is hard like wood! (Tum'ah does not apply to it.)</p></div>
<div class="indent1"><span class="nm">(c)</span><p><span class="cl">Answer (R. Elazar):</span> The Mishnah discusses the lower beak.</p></div>
<div class="indent1"><span class="nm">(d)</span><p><span class="cl">Question:</span> Also the lower beak is hard like wood!</p></div>
<div class="indent1"><span class="nm">(e)</span><p><span class="cl">Answer (Rav Papa):</span> He refers to the inner lining of the upper beak.</p></div>
<div class="indent1"><span class="nm">(f)</span><p><span class="cl">(R. Elazar):</span> The Mishnah discusses the part of the claws inside the flesh.</p></div>
<div class="indent1"><span class="nm">(g)</span><p><span class="cl">(Rav Papa):</span> Our Mishnah (117b) discusses horns, i.e. (the lower part,) where they bleed if cut.</p></div>
<div class="subject"><span class="nm">3)</span><p>AUTOMATIC HECHSHER</p></div>
<div class="indent1"><span class="nm">(a)</span><p><span class="cl">(Mishnah):</span> Similarly, one who slaughters an animal...</p></div>
<div class="indent1"><span class="nm">(b)</span><p><span class="cl">(R. Asi):</span> If a Yisrael slaughters a Tamei animal, or if a Nochri slaughters a Tahor animal, it receives Tum'as Ochlim only if (a Yisrael) intends to feed it to a Nochri, and if it is Huchshar through a liquid.</p></div>
<div class="indent1"><span class="nm">(c)</span><p><span class="cl">Question:</span> Why does it need Hechsher? The meat will have Tum'as Nevelah (when the animal stops quivering). It should not need Hechsher!</p></div>
<div class="indent2"><span class="nm">1.</span><p><span class="cl">(Tana d'Vei R. Yishmael):</span> "When water will be put on seeds" teaches that Hechsher is needed only for things like seeds, which will never have severe Tum'ah (to be Metamei people or Kelim).</p></div>
<div class="indent2"><span class="nm">2.</span><p><span class="cl">(Beraisa - R. Yosi):</span> Nivlas Ohf Tahor needs intent (to eat it) to be Mekabel Tum'as Ochlim. It does not need Hechsher;</p></div>
<div class="indent3"><span class="nm">i.</span><p>This is because it will have severe Tum'ah. (It is Metamei one who eats it.)</p></div>
<div class="bbbline">121b----------------------------------------121b</p></div>
<div class="indent1"><span class="nm">(d)</span><p><span class="cl">Answer (Chizkiyah):</span> (An animal slaughtered by or for a Nochri) needs Hechsher because one could cut it into pieces, each smaller than a k'Zayis (while it is still quivering, so it would not receive Tum'as Nevelah).</p></div>
<div class="indent1"><span class="nm">(e)</span><p><span class="cl">Question (R. Yirmeyah):</span> Did Chizkiyah really say that?!</p></div>
<div class="indent2"><span class="nm">1.</span><p><span class="cl">(Chizkiyah):</span> If the majority of both Simanim of an animal were slaughtered, and it is still quivering, it is not forbidden due to Ever Min ha'Chai, even for a Nochri.</p></div>
<div class="indent2"><span class="nm">2.</span><p><span class="cl">(R. Yochanan):</span> For a Nochri, the limbs are Ever Min ha'Chai, they are forbidden.</p></div>
<div class="indent3"><span class="nm">i.</span><p>Chizkiyah holds that it is considered dead. R. Yochanan holds that it is not considered dead.</p></div>
<div class="indent1"><span class="nm">(f)</span><p><span class="cl">Answer (R. Zeira):</span> No. Chizkiyah holds that it is no longer considered alive, but it is not yet considered dead.</p></div>
<div class="subject"><span class="nm">4)</span><p>AN INVALID SHOCHET OR ANIMAL</p></div>
<div class="indent1"><span class="nm">(a)</span><p><span class="cl">(R. Elazar):</span> The Halachah follows R. Yochanan, for a Beraisa supports him;</p></div>
<div class="indent2"><span class="nm">1.</span><p><span class="cl">(Beraisa):</span> If a Yisrael slaughtered the majority of both Simanim of a Tamei animal for a Nochri, and it is still quivering, it is Mekabel Tum'as Ochlim, but not Tum'as Nevelah;</p></div>
<div class="indent3"><span class="nm">i.</span><p>If limbs or meat separate from it, it is as if they separated from a living animal. They are forbidden to a Nochri, even after the animal dies.</p></div>
<div class="indent2"><span class="nm">2.</span><p>If he slaughtered one Siman or its majority, and it is still quivering, it does not receive Tum'as Ochlim;</p></div>
<div class="indent3"><span class="nm">i.</span><p>If he did Nechirah (cut or tore the Simanim lengthwise), it has no Tum'ah.</p></div>
<div class="indent2"><span class="nm">3.</span><p>If a Nochri slaughtered the majority of both Simanim of a Tahor animal for a Yisrael, and it is still quivering, it is Mekabel Tum'as Ochlim, but not Tum'as Nevelah;</p></div>
<div class="indent3"><span class="nm">i.</span><p>If limbs or meat separate from it, it is as if they separated from a living animal. They are forbidden to a Nochri, even after the animal dies.</p></div>
<div class="indent2"><span class="nm">4.</span><p>If he slaughtered one Siman or its majority, or did Nechirah and it is still quivering, it has no Tum'ah.</p></div>
<div class="indent2"><span class="nm">5.</span><p>If a Nochri began Shechitah, but did not cut enough to make the animal Terefah, and a Yisrael finished the Shechitah, it is Kosher;</p></div>
<div class="indent2"><span class="nm">6.</span><p>If a Yisrael began Shechitah, whether or not he cut enough to make the animal Terefah, and a Nochri finished the Shechitah, the Shechitah is invalid.</p></div>
<div class="indent2"><span class="nm">7.</span><p>If one wants to eat meat that was taken from an animal before it dies (i.e. stops quivering), he may cut some meat from where it was slaughtered, salt and rinse it very well, but he should not eat it until the animal dies.</p></div>
<div class="indent3"><span class="nm">i.</span><p>This is permitted both to a Yisrael or Nochri.</p></div>
<div class="indent3"><span class="nm">ii.</span><p>This supports Rav Idi bar Avin. He said that this is healthy, and said also that it is permitted to Nochrim as well.</p></div>
<div class="indent1"><span class="nm">(b)</span><p><span class="cl">Question (R. Elazar):</span> If a Yisrael slaughtered a Tamei animal, or a Nochri slaughtered a Tahor animal, and he paused during Shechitah, or pressed the knife, is it considered slaughtered (i.e. is it Mekabel Tum'as Ochlim while quivering)?</p></div>
<div class="indent1"><span class="nm">(c)</span><p><span class="cl">Answer (R. Yochanan):</span> It must meet all preparations (conditions) of Kosher Shechitah.</p></div>
<div class="indent2"><span class="nm">1.</span><p><span class="cl">Question:</span> Why did he say "preparations"?</p></div>
<div class="indent2"><span class="nm">2.</span><p><span class="cl">Answer (R. Shmuel bar Yitzchak):</span> This includes checking the knife.</p></div>
<div class="indent1"><span class="nm">(d)</span><p><span class="cl">Question (R. Zeira):</span> If a Yisrael slaughtered a Tamei animal, or a Nochri slaughtered a Tahor animal, and the animal had swallowed a Kli:</p></div>
<div class="indent2"><span class="nm">1.</span><p>While it is still quivering, does it shield the Kli from becoming Tamei in Ohel ha'Mes?</p></div>
<div class="indent1"><span class="nm">(e)</span><p><span class="cl">Answer #1 (Rav Sheshes):</span> The animal receives Tum'as Ochlim (it is considered dead). How could it possibly shield the Kli?!</p></div>
<div class="indent1"><span class="nm">(f)</span><p><span class="cl">Objection (and Answer #2 - R. Zeira):</span> The animal does not have Tum'as Nevelah (it is considered alive). Why shouldn't it save the Kli?!</p></div>
<div class="indent1"><span class="nm">(g)</span><p><span class="cl">Answer #3 (Abaye):</span> It does not save the Kli, because the animal receives Tum'as Ochlim (i.e. we are stringent to consider it to be dead);</p></div>
<div class="indent2"><span class="nm">1.</span><p>If one has relations with it, he is killed, for it does not have Tum'as Nevelah. (I.e. really, it is alive.)</p></div>
