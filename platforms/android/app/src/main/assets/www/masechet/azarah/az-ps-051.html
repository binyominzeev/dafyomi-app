<p class="bas indent1"><span class="nm">(a)</span><span class="cl">Suggestion:</span> Tana'im argue about Rav Yehudah's law.</p>
<p class="bas indent2"><span class="nm">1.</span><span class="cl">(Beraisa - R. Yehudah):</span> If one slaughtered a grasshopper in front of (Rashi - any idolatry; Tosfos - an idolatry to which grasshoppers are offered), he is liable;</p>
<p class="bas indent2"><span class="nm">2.</span>Chachamim exempt.</p>
<p class="bas indent2"><span class="nm">3.</span><span class="cl">Suggestion:</span> R. Yehudah obligates because this resembles slaughter. Likewise, he would obligate for breaking a stick. Chachamim say that this only slightly resembles slaughter, and one is liable only for what truly resembles Avodas Penim.</p>
<p class="bas indent1"><span class="nm">(b)</span><span class="cl">Rejection:</span> No, all agree that one is liable only for what truly resembles Avodas Penim (unlike Rav Yehudah);</p>
<p class="bas indent2"><span class="nm">1.</span>R. Yehudah obligates for a grasshopper, for its neck resembles that of an animal (but if one breaks a stick, he is exempt).</p>
<p class="bas indent1"><span class="nm">(c)</span><span class="cl">(Rav Nachman citing Rabah bar Avuha):</span> An idolatry that is served with a stick:</p>
<p class="bas indent2"><span class="nm">1.</span>If one breaks a stick in front of it, he is Chayav Misah and the stick is forbidden;</p>
<p class="bas indent2"><span class="nm">2.</span>If he threw a stick in front of it (and it is normally served this way), he is liable and the stick is permitted.</p>
<p class="bas indent1"><span class="nm">(d)</span><span class="cl">Question (Ravina):</span> Breaking a stick forbids the stick, for this is like slaughter. Also throwing is like Zerikah!</p>
<p class="bas indent1"><span class="nm">(e)</span><span class="cl">Answer (Rav Nachman):</span> Only throwing something that splits up forbids the article.</p>
<p class="bas indent1"><span class="nm">(f)</span><span class="cl">Question (Rava):</span> If so, why do stones thrown to Markulis become forbidden?</p>
<p class="bas indent1"><span class="nm">(g)</span><span class="cl">Answer (Rav Nachman citing Rav):</span> They are like additions to Markulis. They are forbidden like idolatry.</p>
<p class="bas indent1"><span class="nm">(h)</span><span class="cl">Question:</span> This is like the opinion that idolatry of a Nochri is forbidden even before it is worshipped;</p>
<p class="bas indent2"><span class="nm">1.</span>According to the opinion that idolatry of a Nochri is not forbidden until it is worshipped, it should be permitted!</p>
<p class="bas indent1"><span class="nm">(i)</span><span class="cl">Answer #1:</span> When the next rock was thrown, this is an act of Avodah to all the previous rocks.</p>
<p class="bas indent2"><span class="nm">1.</span><span class="cl">Question (Rava):</span> If so, the last rock thrown should be permitted!</p>
<p class="bas indent2"><span class="nm">2.</span><span class="cl">Answer (Rav Nachman):</span> Yes, but you do not know which was thrown last, so all are forbidden.</p>
<p class="bas indent1"><span class="nm">(j)</span><span class="cl">Answer #2 (Rav Ashi):</span> When each rock is thrown, this is Avodah to <i>itself and</i> all the previous rocks, so even it becomes forbidden.</p>
<p class="bas indent1"><span class="nm">(k)</span><span class="cl">(Mishnah):</span> If garments, coins or Kelim were found on idolatry, they are permitted;</p>
<p class="bas indent2"><span class="nm">1.</span>If grape clusters, wreaths of ears (of grain), wine, oil, fine flour, or anything offered in the Mikdash was found on it, they are forbidden.</p>
<p class="bas indent1"><span class="nm">(l)</span><span class="cl">Question:</span> We understand why wine, oil, and fine flour are forbidden. They are brought in the Mikdash, and when thrown they split up;</p>
<p class="bas indent2"><span class="nm">1.</span>However, grape clusters and wreaths of ears are not brought in the Mikdash, and when thrown they do not split up. They should be permitted!</p>
<p class="bas indent1"><span class="nm">(m)</span><span class="cl">Answer (Rava):</span> The case is, from the beginning they were harvested to be offered to idolatry (therefore, the harvesting is Avodah. It is like throwing that splits up).</p>
<p class="bas indent1"><span class="nm">(n)</span><span class="cl">Question (R. Yochanan):</span> What is the source to exempt one who slaughters a Ba'al Mum (blemished animal) to idolatry?</p>
<p class="bas indent1"><span class="nm">(o)</span><span class="cl">Answer (R. Yochanan):</span> "Zove'ach la'Elokim Yocharam Bilti la'Shem Levado" - the Torah forbids only Avodah like that in the Mikdash.</p>
<p class="bas indent1"><span class="nm">(p)</span><span class="cl">Question (Rava):</span> To what kind of Mum does he refer?</p>
<p class="bas indent2"><span class="nm">1.</span><span class="cl">Suggestion:</span> He refers to a film in the eye.</p>
<p class="bas indent2"><span class="nm">2.</span><span class="cl">Rejection:</span> A Nochri may offer such an animal to Hash-m on a Bamah (private altar), and all the more so he is liable for offering it to idolatry!</p>
<p class="bas indent1"><span class="nm">(q)</span><span class="cl">Answer:</span> Rather, he discusses an animal missing a limb.</p>
<p class="bas indent2"><span class="nm">1.</span><span class="cl">Question (R. Elazar):</span> What is the source that a Nochri may not offer (to Hash-m) an animal missing a limb?</p>
<p class="bas indent2"><span class="nm">2.</span><span class="cl">Answer (R. Elazar):</span> "Umi'Kol ha'Chai" - its extremal limbs must be Chayim (intact).</p>
<p class="bas indent2"><span class="nm">3.</span><span class="cl">Question:</span> That verse is needed to exclude a Treifah!</p>
<p class="bas indent2"><span class="nm">4.</span><span class="cl">Answer:</span> We exclude a Treifah from "Lechayos Zera."</p>
<p class="bas indent2"><span class="nm">5.</span><span class="cl">Question:</span> This is like the opinion that a Treifah cannot reproduce;</p>
<p class="bas indent3"><span class="nm">i.</span>According to the opinion that a Treifah can reproduce, how can we answer?</p>
<p class="bas indent2"><span class="nm">6.</span><span class="cl">Answer:</span> "Itecha" - the animals should resemble you (Noach, who was not (visibly) a Treifah).</p>
<p class="bas indent2"><span class="nm">7.</span><span class="cl">Question:</span> Perhaps Noach was a Treifah!</p>
<p class="bas indent2"><span class="nm">8.</span><span class="cl">Answer #1:</span> This cannot be. The Torah calls him "Tamim."</p>
<p class="bas indent3"><span class="nm">i.</span><span class="cl">Question:</span> Perhaps it means that he was Tamim (pure) in his ways!</p>
<p class="bas indent3"><span class="nm">ii.</span><span class="cl">Answer:</span> We already know this, for he is called a Tzadik.</p>
<p class="bas indent3"><span class="nm">iii.</span><span class="cl">Question:</span> Perhaps it means that he was Tamim in his ways and Tzadik in his deeds!</p>
<p class="bas indent2"><span class="nm">9.</span><span class="cl">Answer #2:</span> The Torah would not say "Itecha" to teach that he should bring specifically animals that are Treifah!</p>
<p class="bas indent2"><span class="nm">10.</span><span class="cl">Question:</span> Since "Itecha" excludes a Treifah, what do we learn from "Lechayos Zera"?</p>
<p class="bas indent2"><span class="nm">11.</span><span class="cl">Answer:</span> Had it said only "Itecha", one might have thought that the animals are merely for company. If so, sterilized or old animals unable to reproduce would be acceptable. (Treifos are excluded, for they will die soon;)</p>
<p class="bas indent3"><span class="nm">i.</span>"Lechayos Zera" teaches that they must be able to reproduce.</p>
<p class="bas subject"><span class="nm">2)</span>'AVODAS PENIM' TO IDOLATRY</p>
<p class="bas indent1"><span class="nm">(a)</span><span class="cl">Question (R. Elazar):</span> What is the source that one who slaughters an animal to Markulis is Chayav Misah?</p>
<p class="bas indent1"><span class="nm">(b)</span><span class="cl">Answer (R. Elazar):</span> "V'Lo Yizbechu Od Es Zivcheihem la'Se'irim";</p>
<p class="bas indent2"><span class="nm">1.</span>We do not need it to teach about the normal Avodah of Markulis, which we learn from "Eichah Ya'avdu... Es Eloheihem", so we use it to teach about (Avodas Penim that is) not its normal Avodah.</p>
<p class="bas indent1"><span class="nm">(c)</span><span class="cl">Question:</span> "V'Lo Yizbechu Od" teaches a different law!</p>
<p class="bas bbbline">51b----------------------------------------51b</p>
<p class="bas indent2"><span class="nm">1.</span><span class="cl">(Beraisa):</span> "V'Lo Yizbechu" teaches about Korbanos that were Hukdash and offered (outside the Mikdash) when one may not offer on a Bamah (e.g. before the Mishkan was built).</p>
<p class="bas indent2"><span class="nm">2.</span><span class="cl">Question:</span> "V'El Pesach Ohel Mo'ed Lo Hevi'o (he gets Kares)" - where does the Torah warn not to slaughter Korbanos outside the Mikdash?</p>
<p class="bas indent2"><span class="nm">3.</span><span class="cl">Answer:</span> It says "Pen Ta'aleh Olosecha";</p>
<p class="bas indent3"><span class="nm">i.</span><span class="cl">(R. Avin):</span> Wherever it says 'Hishamer', 'Pen' or 'Al', this is a Lav.</p>
<p class="bas indent2"><span class="nm">4.</span>The continuation of the verse discusses Korbanos that were Hukdash when it was permitted to offer on a Bamah and were offered (outside the Mikdash) after this became forbidden - "Lema'an Asher Yavi'u... Asher Hem Zovechim" - they were permitted before;</p>
<p class="bas indent3"><span class="nm">i.</span>"Al Penei ha'Sadeh" - whoever slaughters on a Bamah when it is forbidden is like one who slaughters to idolatry;</p>
<p class="bas indent3"><span class="nm">ii.</span>"Ve'Hevi'um la'Shem" is an Aseh;</p>
<p class="bas indent3"><span class="nm">iii.</span>We learn a Lav from "v'Lo Yizbechu Od Es Zivcheihem."</p>
<p class="bas indent3"><span class="nm">iv.</span><span class="cl">Suggestion:</span> Perhaps one is Chayav Kares for this!</p>
<p class="bas indent3"><span class="nm">v.</span><span class="cl">Rejection:</span> "Chukas Olam Tihyeh Zos Lahem" - only this (when it was Hukdash when Bamos are forbidden) is Chayav Kares.</p>
<p class="bas indent1"><span class="nm">(d)</span><span class="cl">Answer (Rava):</span> We read the verse as if it said 'v'Lo Yizbechu <i>v'Lo</i> Od', to teach this Lav and a Lav against Avodas Penim to idolatry.</p>
<p class="bas subject"><span class="nm">3)</span>THINGS PUT NEAR OR ON IDOLATRY</p>
<p class="bas indent1"><span class="nm">(a)</span><span class="cl">(Mishnah):</span> If garments, coins or Kelim were found on idolatry, they are permitted;</p>
<p class="bas indent2"><span class="nm">1.</span>If grape clusters, wreaths of ears, wine, oil, fine flour, or anything offered in the Mikdash was found on it, it is forbidden.</p>
<p class="bas indent1"><span class="nm">(b)</span><span class="cl">(Gemara) Question:</span> What is the source of this?</p>
<p class="bas indent1"><span class="nm">(c)</span><span class="cl">Answer (R. Chiya bar Yosef) Contradiction:</span> It says "Shikutzeihem... Etz va'Even Kesef v'Zahav Asher <i>Imahem</i> (with them)", and it says "Lo Sachmod Kesef v'Zahav <i>Aleihem</i> (on them)"!</p>
<p class="bas indent2"><span class="nm">1.</span><span class="cl">Answer:</span> What is with, i.e. near idolatry, is like what is on it;</p>
<p class="bas indent3"><span class="nm">i.</span>The Torah forbids only gold and silver on it, i.e. Noy (things that beautify it). Likewise, only Noy near it is forbidden!</p>
<p class="bas indent1"><span class="nm">(d)</span><span class="cl">Question:</span> Perhaps we should expound 'what is on it is like what is near it';</p>
<p class="bas indent2"><span class="nm">1.</span>The Torah forbids only everything near it, even rocks and wood, which are not (normally) Noy. Likewise, things on it, even not for Noy, are forbidden!</p>
<p class="bas indent1"><span class="nm">(e)</span><span class="cl">Answer:</span> If so, the Torah could have omitted "Lo Sachmod Kesef v'Zahav Aleihem"! (Since it taught that everything near it is forbidden, and all the more so everything on it is forbidden.)</p>
<p class="bas indent1"><span class="nm">(f)</span><span class="cl">Question:</span> Coins are Noy. Why does the Mishnah permit them?</p>
<p class="bas indent1"><span class="nm">(g)</span><span class="cl">Answer (d'Vei R. Yanai):</span> They are in a bag tied around the idol's neck (they are not Noy).</p>
<p class="bas indent1"><span class="nm">(h)</span><span class="cl">Question:</span> Garments are Noy. Why does the Mishnah permit them?</p>
<p class="bas indent1"><span class="nm">(i)</span><span class="cl">Answer (d'Vei R. Yanai):</span> They are folded and placed on the idol's head (they are not Noy).</p>
<p class="bas indent1"><span class="nm">(j)</span><span class="cl">Question:</span> Kelim are Noy. Why does the Mishnah permit them?</p>
<p class="bas indent1"><span class="nm">(k)</span><span class="cl">Answer (d'Vei R. Yanai):</span> A wash basin is hanging on its head (it is not Noy).</p>
<p class="bas indent1"><span class="nm">(l)</span><span class="cl">(Rav Asi bar Chiya):</span> Whatever is inside the curtain (around the idolatry) is forbidden, even water or salt (which are not for Noy, but they are Takroves, for they are offered in the Mikdash);</p>
<p class="bas indent2"><span class="nm">1.</span>Outside the curtain, only articles of Noy are forbidden (Rashi - from the above verse "Etz v'aEven... Asher Imahem"; Tosfos - it is Takroves).</p>
<p class="bas indent1"><span class="nm">(m)</span><span class="cl">(R. Yosi bar Chanina):</span> The Halachah is, curtains do not apply to Ba'al Pe'or or Markulis.</p>
<p class="bas indent1"><span class="nm">(n)</span><span class="cl">Question:</span> What is their law?</p>
<p class="bas indent2"><span class="nm">1.</span><span class="cl">Suggestion:</span> Even within the curtains is considered outside, only articles of Noy are forbidden.</p>
<p class="bas indent2"><span class="nm">2.</span><span class="cl">Rejection:</span> Excreting in front of Pe'or is its Avodah. Can we say that water or salt is not Takroves?!</p>
<p class="bas indent1"><span class="nm">(o)</span><span class="cl">Answer:</span> Even outside the curtains is considered inside. Even things that are not Noy are forbidden.</p>
<p class="bas subject"><span class="nm">4)</span>BENEFITING IDOLATRY</p>
<p class="bas indent1"><span class="nm">(a)</span><span class="cl">(Mishnah):</span> If there is a bathhouse or garden of idolatry, one may benefit from it only if he does <i>not</i> give benefit;</p>
<p class="bas indent2"><span class="nm">1.</span>If it belonged to idolatry and others, one may benefit, and he may give or (Maharsha - and) not give benefit.</p>
<p class="bas indent1"><span class="nm">(b)</span>Idolatry of a Nochri is forbidden immediately. Idolatry of a Yisrael is permitted until it is worshipped.</p>
<p class="bas indent1"><span class="nm">(c)</span><span class="cl">Version #1 (Gemara - Abaye):</span> The Mishnah forbids benefiting the priests of the idolatry;</p>
<p class="bas indent2"><span class="nm">1.</span>One may benefit commoners who serve it.</p>
<p class="bas indent1"><span class="nm">(d)</span><span class="cl">Version #2 (Abaye):</span> The Seifa says, if it belonged to idolatry and others, one may benefit, and he may give and not give benefit. I.e. he may benefit the others, but he may not benefit the priests.</p>
<p class="bas indent1"><span class="nm">(e)</span>Version #2 certainly agrees to the law of Version #1. If one may not benefit the priests even though they are not the sole owners, and all the more so when they are the sole owners!</p>
<p class="bas indent1"><span class="nm">(f)</span>Version #1 argues with the law of Version #2. If one may not benefit the priests only if they are the sole owners, when they are not the sole owners, it is permitted.</p>
<p class="bas subject"><span class="nm">5)</span>WHEN DOES IDOLATRY BECOME FORBIDDEN?</p>
<p class="bas indent1"><span class="nm">(a)</span><span class="cl">(Mishnah):</span> Idolatry of a Nochri is forbidden immediately, idolatry of a Yisrael is permitted until it is worshipped.</p>
<p class="bas indent1"><span class="nm">(b)</span>Our Mishnah is like R. Akiva.</p>
<p class="bas indent2"><span class="nm">1.</span><span class="cl">(Beraisa - R. Yishmael):</span> "Abed Te'abdun Es Kol ha'Mekomos Asher Avdu Sham ha'Goyim" refers to Kelim used to serve idolatry.</p>
<p class="bas indent3"><span class="nm">i.</span><span class="cl">Suggestion:</span> Perhaps the Kelim are forbidden if they were made (for idolatry) but not yet finished, if they were finished but not yet brought to the idolatry, or if they were brought but not yet used to serve.</p>
<p class="bas indent3"><span class="nm">ii.</span><span class="cl">Rejection:</span> "Asher <i>Avdu</i>" - they are not forbidden until they are used to serve;</p>
<p class="bas indent3"><span class="nm">iii.</span>This teaches that idolatry of a Nochri is not forbidden until it is Ne'evad. Idolatry of a Yisrael is forbidden immediately.</p>
<p class="bas indent2"><span class="nm">2.</span>R. Akiva says, just the contrary! Idolatry of a Nochri is forbidden immediately. Idolatry of a Yisrael is permitted until it is worshipped.</p>
