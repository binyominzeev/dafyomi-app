<p class="bas subject"><span class="nm">1)</span>DISTANCING ONE'S SELF FROM MINIM</p>
<p class="bas indent1"><span class="nm">(a)</span>R. Eliezer returned home distraught. He did not know why Hash-m caused him to be seized. He refused to be consoled.</p>
<p class="bas indent2"><span class="nm">1.</span><span class="cl">R. Akiva:</span> May I say something that you taught me?</p>
<p class="bas indent2"><span class="nm">2.</span><span class="cl">R. Eliezer:</span> Yes.</p>
<p class="bas indent2"><span class="nm">3.</span><span class="cl">R. Akiva:</span> Perhaps this was a punishment for benefit from heresy!</p>
<p class="bas indent2"><span class="nm">4.</span><span class="cl">R. Eliezer:</span> Indeed, I remember that once, a Min asked 'may an Esnan (wages paid to a harlot) be used to make a toilet for a Kohen Gadol'?</p>
<p class="bas indent3"><span class="nm">i.</span>I did not answer. He answered "me'Esnan Zonah Kibatzah v'Ad Esnan Zonah Yashuvu" - it comes from filth, and returns to filth.</p>
<p class="bas indent2"><span class="nm">5.</span>I enjoyed his answer. Therefore, I was seized;</p>
<p class="bas indent3"><span class="nm">i.</span><span class="cl">Version #1:</span> "Harchek Me'aleha Darkecha"- stay far from heresy. "V'Al Tikrav El Pesach Beisah" - do not approach the authorities (they kill people to take their money).</p>
<p class="bas indent3"><span class="nm">ii.</span><span class="cl">Version #2:</span> "Harchek Me'aleha..." - from heresy and the authorities. "V'Al Tikrav El Pesach Beisah" - of a harlot.</p>
<p class="bas indent3"><span class="nm">iii.</span><span class="cl">Question:</span> How far must one stay away?</p>
<p class="bas indent3"><span class="nm">iv.</span><span class="cl">Answer (Rav Chisda):</span> He must stay four Amos away.</p>
<p class="bas indent1"><span class="nm">(b)</span><span class="cl">Question:</span> How do Chachamim (who do not expound as the Min) expound "me'Esnan..."?</p>
<p class="bas indent1"><span class="nm">(c)</span><span class="cl">Answer:</span> They expound like Rav Chisda taught.</p>
<p class="bas indent2"><span class="nm">1.</span><span class="cl">(Rav Chisda):</span> A harlot hires herself out, and in the end, she is despised, and she will pay men - "uv'Sitech Esnan... va'Tehi l'Hefech."</p>
<p class="bas indent1"><span class="nm">(d)</span>R. Pedas argues with Rav Chisda (who expounded that one must distance four Amos).</p>
<p class="bas indent2"><span class="nm">1.</span><span class="cl">(R. Pedas):</span> The 'Kirvah' (approaching) the Torah forbids is actual relations with Arayos - "Lo Sikrevu Legalos Ervah."</p>
<p class="bas indent1"><span class="nm">(e)</span>When Ula would return from learning, he would kiss his sisters' lower arms (some say, (the garment over their) chests).</p>
<p class="bas indent1"><span class="nm">(f)</span><span class="cl">Question:</span> Ula himself expounded that even approaching Arayos is forbidden - 'Lech Lech Amrin Nezira... ';</p>
<p class="bas indent2"><span class="nm">1.</span><span class="cl">Question:</span> What is the meaning of "la'Alukah Shtei Vanos Hav Hav"?</p>
<p class="bas indent2"><span class="nm">2.</span><span class="cl">Version #1 - Answer (Mar Ukva):</span> These are two groups that scream in Gehinom (due to their great tortures), that say in this world 'Hav Hav (give, give)' - Minim and the authorities.</p>
<p class="bas indent2"><span class="nm">3.</span><span class="cl">Version #2 - Answer (Rav Chisda citing Mar Ukva):</span> Gehinom is requesting (to receive) the two groups that say in this world 'give, give' (Gehinom seeks to punish them).</p>
<p class="bas indent1"><span class="nm">(g)</span><span class="cl">Question:</span> "Kol Ba'eha Lo Yeshuvun v'Lo Yasigu Orechos Chayim" - since (Minim) do not repent, surely they do not attain the ways of life!</p>
<p class="bas indent1"><span class="nm">(h)</span><span class="cl">Answer:</span> Even if they do repent, they do not attain the ways of life!</p>
<p class="bas indent1"><span class="nm">(i)</span><span class="cl">Version #1 - Inference:</span> If they repent, they will not live (from the pain of fighting the evil inclination which became so strong in them);</p>
<p class="bas indent1"><span class="nm">(j)</span><span class="cl">Question:</span> A woman came in front of Rav Chisda (to repent). The lightest sin she had done was having a child through her son;</p>
<p class="bas indent2"><span class="nm">1.</span>Rav Chisda told people to prepare shrouds for her, but she did not die;</p>
<p class="bas indent2"><span class="nm">2.</span>If her lightest sin was incest, surely she was a Min!</p>
<p class="bas indent1"><span class="nm">(k)</span><span class="cl">Answer:</span> She did not repent properly, therefore she did not die.</p>
<p class="bas indent1"><span class="nm">(l)</span><span class="cl">Version #2 - Inference:</span> Only a Min, if he repents, will not live, but one who sinned with Arayos will live;</p>
<p class="bas indent1"><span class="nm">(m)</span><span class="cl">Question:</span> A woman came in front of Rav Chisda. Her lightest sin was incest. Rav Chisda told people to prepare shrouds for her, and she died!</p>
<p class="bas indent1"><span class="nm">(n)</span><span class="cl">Answer:</span> Her lightest sin was incest, surely she had been a Min. (end of Version #2)</p>
<p class="bas indent1"><span class="nm">(o)</span><span class="cl">Question:</span> Is it really true that one who sinned with Arayos can repent and live?!</p>
<p class="bas indent2"><span class="nm">1.</span><span class="cl">(Beraisa):</span> Eliezer ben Durdiya slept with every harlot in the world. He heard of a harlot overseas who charged a bag of coins. He took the money and went to her. During the act, she let off gas, and said 'just like the gas will not return, you will not be received if you repent.'</p>
<p class="bas indent2"><span class="nm">2.</span>Eliezer sat between two mountains and asked them to request mercy for him. They responded that they must request for themselves - "he'Harim Yamushu...";</p>
<p class="bas indent2"><span class="nm">3.</span>He requested from Heaven and earth, the sun, moon and stars (one at a time). Each responded that it must request for itself.</p>
<p class="bas indent2"><span class="nm">4.</span>He realized that he must ask for himself; he put his head between his knees and cried, and died.</p>
<p class="bas indent2"><span class="nm">5.</span><span class="cl">A voice from Heaven:</span> R. Eliezer ben Durdiya is prepared for the world to come (without need for Gehinom).</p>
<p class="bas indent2"><span class="nm">6.</span><span class="cl">Summation of question:</span> His only sin was Arayos, and he died due to his repentance!</p>
<p class="bas indent1"><span class="nm">(p)</span><span class="cl">Answer:</span> Since he was so steeped in it, it was like heresy.</p>
<p class="bas indent1"><span class="nm">(q)</span><span class="cl">Rebbi cried:</span> Some acquire their share in the world to come in a moment (and therefore have a small share), and some acquire their share over the course of many years.</p>
<p class="bas indent1"><span class="nm">(r)</span><span class="cl">Rebbi:</span> Not only is Teshuvah accepted, rather, the penitent even gets the title of 'Rebbi'!</p>
<p class="bas subject"><span class="nm">2)</span>HASH-M PROTECTS TZADIKIM</p>
<p class="bas indent1"><span class="nm">(a)</span>R. Chanina and R. Yonason were travelling. There were two paths in front of them. One went near idolatry, and the other went near harlots. One of them suggested going on the path of idolatry, for its evil inclination was slaughtered (through the prayer of the Great Assembly).</p>
<p class="bas bbbline">17b----------------------------------------17b</p>
<p class="bas indent2"><span class="nm">1.</span><span class="cl">The other:</span> Rather, we should go by the harlots, and receive reward for overcoming our evil inclinations!</p>
<p class="bas indent2"><span class="nm">2.</span>When they approached the harlots, the harlots retreated to their rooms.</p>
<p class="bas indent2"><span class="nm">3.</span><span class="cl">The first one:</span> How did you know to trust in yourself?</p>
<p class="bas indent2"><span class="nm">4.</span><span class="cl">The other:</span> "Mezimah Tishmor Alecha Tevunah Sintzerecha."</p>
<p class="bas indent1"><span class="nm">(b)</span><span class="cl">Question (Rabanan):</span> What does "Mezimah" mean?</p>
<p class="bas indent2"><span class="nm">1.</span><span class="cl">Suggestion:</span> It refers to Torah, for the translation of "Zimah" is counsel (regarding illicit relations, it is a sinful counsel);</p>
<p class="bas indent3"><span class="nm">i.</span>Torah is called counsel - "Hifli <i>Etzah</i> Higdil Tushiyah."</p>
<p class="bas indent2"><span class="nm">2.</span><span class="cl">Rejection:</span> If so, it should have said 'Zimah', and not "Mezimah"!</p>
<p class="bas indent1"><span class="nm">(c)</span><span class="cl">Answer (Rava):</span> Rather, it means 'from a matter of Zimah, Torah will save you.'</p>
<p class="bas indent1"><span class="nm">(d)</span><span class="cl">(Beraisa):</span> R. Elazar ben Parta and R. Chanina ben Tradyon were seized to be tried.</p>
<p class="bas indent2"><span class="nm">1.</span><span class="cl">R. Elazar ben Parta:</span> You are more likely to be saved than I. They have only one claim against you, and they have five against me!</p>
<p class="bas indent2"><span class="nm">2.</span><span class="cl">R. Chanina ben Tradyon:</span> Nevertheless, you will be saved and not me, for you engaged in Torah and Chesed, but I engaged only in Torah.</p>
<p class="bas indent3"><span class="nm">i.</span><span class="cl">(Rav Huna):</span> One who only engages in Torah is like one who has no G-d (to protect him) - "v'Yamim Rabim l'Yisrael l'Lo Elokei Emes."</p>
<p class="bas indent2"><span class="nm">3.</span><span class="cl">Question:</span> Is it really true that R. Chanina did not engage in Chesed?</p>
<p class="bas indent3"><span class="nm">i.</span><span class="cl">(Beraisa - R. Eliezer ben Yakov):</span> One should not give a Perutah to the Tzedakah pouch unless the one appointed over it is as trustworthy as R. Chanina ben Tradyon.</p>
<p class="bas indent2"><span class="nm">4.</span><span class="cl">Answer:</span> Indeed, we want someone as trustworthy as R. Chanina ben Tradyon, but he himself was not appointed over it.</p>
<p class="bas indent2"><span class="nm">5.</span><span class="cl">Question (Beraisa - R. Chanina ben Tradyon):</span> I once collected money for (the poor for the feast of) Purim, and I mistakenly thought that it was Stam (regular) Tzedakah, and I gave it for Stam Tzedakah (Tosfos - he realized his mistake after gathering the poor to distribute Tzedakah, but gave it anyway, he did not want to disappoint them);</p>
<p class="bas indent3"><span class="nm">i.</span>Later, (Rashi - when I realized my mistake) I donated that amount for Purim.</p>
<p class="bas indent2"><span class="nm">6.</span><span class="cl">Answer:</span> He did (Tzedakah, and surely also) Chesed, but not as much as he should have.</p>
<p class="bas subject"><span class="nm">3)</span>THE SALVATION OF R. ELAZAR BEN PARTA</p>
<p class="bas indent1"><span class="nm">(a)</span>They charged R. Elazar ben Parta for teaching Torah and stealing.</p>
<p class="bas indent2"><span class="nm">1.</span><span class="cl">R. Elazar:</span> Surely, one who steals cannot teach Torah! Just like one of these claims is surely false, both are false.</p>
<p class="bas indent2"><span class="nm">2.</span><span class="cl">The prosecutors:</span> Why are you called 'Rebbi'?</p>
<p class="bas indent2"><span class="nm">3.</span><span class="cl">R. Elazar:</span> I am the teacher of weavers.</p>
<p class="bas indent2"><span class="nm">4.</span><span class="cl">The prosecutors:</span> If so, go discern between these two balls of thread, which is warp (the lengthwise threads) and which is woof (the widthwise threads)!</p>
<p class="bas indent3"><span class="nm">i.</span>Hash-m sent him a sign. He made a male bee land on the warp, and a female bee on the woof (which is like a female, for the warp is inserted into it in the loom).</p>
<p class="bas indent2"><span class="nm">5.</span><span class="cl">The prosecutors:</span> Why don't you come to our feasts to honor the idolatry?</p>
<p class="bas indent2"><span class="nm">6.</span><span class="cl">R. Elazar:</span> I am old. I fear being trampled.</p>
<p class="bas indent2"><span class="nm">7.</span><span class="cl">The prosecutors:</span> Many old people come, and they are not trampled!</p>
<p class="bas indent3"><span class="nm">i.</span>Hash-m caused that an old person was trampled that day.</p>
<p class="bas indent2"><span class="nm">8.</span><span class="cl">The prosecutors:</span> Why did you free your slave? We decreed against this!</p>
<p class="bas indent2"><span class="nm">9.</span><span class="cl">R. Elazar:</span> I did not!</p>
<p class="bas indent2"><span class="nm">10.</span>A Roman was about to testify that he did. Eliyahu appeared to him, in the guise of a noble.</p>
<p class="bas indent3"><span class="nm">i.</span><span class="cl">Eliyahu:</span> Every time he is saved by miracles. Also now, it will not help to testify. You will only be shamed!</p>
<p class="bas indent2"><span class="nm">11.</span>The Roman did not listen; he got up to testify.</p>
<p class="bas indent3"><span class="nm">i.</span>That day, the nobles had written a letter to the Kaiser. They picked that man to take it. Eliyahu threw him 400 Parsa'os, so he would not return to testify.</p>
<p class="bas subject"><span class="nm">4)</span>THE DECREES AGAINST THE FAMILY OF R. CHANINA BEN TERADYON</p>
<p class="bas indent1"><span class="nm">(a)</span>They charged R. Chanina ben Tradyon 'why did you engage in Torah?'</p>
<p class="bas indent1"><span class="nm">(b)</span><span class="cl">R. Chanina:</span> Hash-m commanded me to!</p>
<p class="bas indent1"><span class="nm">(c)</span>They immediately decreed that he would be burned, that his wife would be killed, and his daughter (one of them) would be placed in a harlots' booth.</p>
