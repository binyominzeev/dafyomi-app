<div class="indent1"><span class="nm">(a)</span><p><span class="cl">(The sharp Chachamim of Pumbadisa, i.e. Eifah and Avimi):</span> Haktarah is Mefagel Haktarah (e.g. if Haktaras Kometz was with intent to be Maktir the Levonah Chutz li'Zmano);</p></div>
<div class="indent2"><span class="nm">1.</span><p>Even Chachamim say only that intent during only part of the Matirim is not Mefagel, e.g. intent in the Kometz for the Shirayim, for there was no improper intent for the Levonah. When the intent is for the Levonah, it is as if he intended for all the Matirim, so they agree that there is Pigul. (Clearly, this is unlike R. Yosi on 13a.)</p></div>

<div class="indent2"><span class="nm">1.</span><p>If he intended Chutz li'Mkomo, the Minchah is Pasul, and there is no Kares;</p></div>
<div class="indent2"><span class="nm">2.</span><p>If he intended Chutz li'Zmano, it is Pigul, and there is Kares.</p></div>
<div class="indent2"><span class="nm">3.</span><p><span class="cl">Suggestion:</span> Haktarah is like the other Avodos. It is Mefagel whether the intent was to eat or to be Maktir.</p></div>
<div class="indent1"><span class="nm">(c)</span><p><span class="cl">Rejection:</span> No, the other Avodos are Mefagel whether the intent was to eat or to be Maktir, but Haktarah is Mefagel only if the intent (during the entire Haktarah) was to eat.</p></div>
<div class="indent1"><span class="nm">(d)</span><p><span class="cl">(Rav Menasiya bar Gada citing Rav Chisda):</span> Haktarah is not Mefagel Haktarah;</p></div>
<div class="indent2"><span class="nm">1.</span><p>Even R. Meir says only that intent during part of the Matirim is Mefagel when he intends for the Shirayim, for the Kometz permits them, but not when he intends for the Levonah, for the Kometz does not permit it.</p></div>
<div class="indent1"><span class="nm">(e)</span><p><span class="cl">Abaye:</span> Did Rav Chisda say that in Rav's name?</p></div>

<div class="indent2"><span class="nm">1.</span><p><span class="cl">(Rav Chisda citing Rav):</span> Haktarah is not Mefagel Haktarah.</p></div>

<div class="indent2"><span class="nm">1.</span><p>If he slaughtered it with intent to eat a k'Zayis of the other lamb tomorrow, both are Kesherim.</p></div>
<div class="indent2"><span class="nm">2.</span><p><span class="cl">Suggestion:</span> One lamb does not permit the other. This is why one is not Mefagel the other.</p></div>
<div class="indent1"><span class="nm">(h)</span><p><span class="cl">Rejection:</span> One lamb is not Mefagel the other because they were not in a Kli together;</p></div>
<div class="indent2"><span class="nm">1.</span><p>Kometz and Levonah were in a Kli together, so they are like one. (Perhaps) Kometz can be Mefagel Levonah.</p></div>
<div class="indent1"><span class="nm">(i)</span><p>Rav HamnunaR. Chanina taught the following to me, it is as dear to me as all my learning:</p></div>
<div class="indent2"><span class="nm">1.</span><p>If Haktaras Kometz was with intent to be Maktir the Levonah with intent to eat the Shirayim tomorrow, it is Pigul.</p></div>
<div class="indent1"><span class="nm">(j)</span><p><span class="cl">Question:</span> What is the Chidush?</p></div>
<div class="indent2"><span class="nm">1.</span><p>If he teaches that Haktarah is Mefagel Haktarah, he should merely say 'if Haktaras Kometz was with intent to be Maktir the Levonah (tomorrow...', without mentioning eating the Shirayim)!</p></div>
<div class="indent2"><span class="nm">2.</span><p>If he teaches that intent for part of the Matirim is Mefagel, he should merely say 'if Haktaras Kometz was with intent to eat the Shirayim' (without mentioning the Levonah)!</p></div>

<div class="indent1"><span class="nm">(k)</span><p><span class="cl">Answer (Rav Ada bar Ahavah):</span> Really, Haktarah is not Mefagel Haktarah, and intent for part of the Matirim is not Mefagel;</p></div>
<div class="indent2"><span class="nm">1.</span><p>This case is different, for all of the Minchah is involved in the intent Chutz li'Zmano.</p></div>

<div class="indent1"><span class="nm">(a)</span><p><span class="cl">(Mishnah):</span> If Kemitzah was done with intent to eat (Chutz li'Zmano or Chutz li'Mkomo) something which is not normally eaten, or to be Maktir something not normally Huktar, it is Kosher;</p></div>
<div class="indent1"><span class="nm">(b)</span><p>R. Eliezer says, it is Pasul.</p></div>
<div class="indent1"><span class="nm">(c)</span><p>If he intended to eat less than a k'Zayis of something normally eaten, or to be Maktir less than a k'Zayis of something normally Huktar, it is Kosher;</p></div>
<div class="indent1"><span class="nm">(d)</span><p>If he intended to eat half a k'Zayis and to be Maktir half a k'Zayis, it is Kosher, because eating and Haktarah do not join.</p></div>
<div class="indent1"><span class="nm">(e)</span><p><span class="cl">(Gemara - Rav Asi citing R. Yochanan):</span> R. Eliezer learns from "v'Im He'achel Ye'achel..." - the verse discusses two kinds of eating, of people and of the Mizbe'ach;</p></div>
<div class="indent2"><span class="nm">1.</span><p>Just like intent (Chutz) for people to eat is Posel, also intent for the Mizbe'ach to 'eat' (Haktarah) is Posel;</p></div>

<div class="indent2"><span class="nm">3.</span><p><span class="cl">Question:</span> What is the source of this?</p></div>
<div class="indent2"><span class="nm">4.</span><p><span class="cl">Answer:</span> The Torah calls Haktarah 'eating' to teach this.</p></div>

<div class="indent3"><span class="nm">i.</span><p>Alternatively, they learn from this that the Shi'ur for Haktarah (that improper intent is Posel) is a k'Zayis, the Shi'ur for eating;</p></div>
<div class="indent3"><span class="nm">ii.</span><p>However, the intent must be for what is normally eaten (by the person or Mizbe'ach).</p></div>
<div class="indent2"><span class="nm">6.</span><p>R. Eliezer says, the Torah could have said 'He'achel He'achel' or 'Ye'achel Ye'achel', and this would teach these two laws (the latter follows from the former);</p></div>
