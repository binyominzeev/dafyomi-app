<div class="indent2"><span class="nm">1.</span><p>His son died of thirst.</p></div>
<div class="indent2"><span class="nm">2.</span><p><span class="cl">(R. Chaninah):</span> Whoever says that Hash-m ignores and overlooks...</p></div>
<div class="indent2"><span class="nm">3.</span><p>Thus the evil are not always punished owing to HaShem's forbearance, not owing to his sins being overlooked.</p></div>
<div class="indent2"><span class="nm">4.</span><p>All debts are paid in the end.</p></div>
<div class="indent2"><span class="nm">5.</span><p>Two alternate sources for Hash-m being extremely particular with the righteous.</p></div>
<div class="indent2"><span class="nm">6.</span><p>The daughter of the Chasid who dug pits for the communal good was miraculously saved.</p></div>
<div class="indent1"><span class="nm">(b)</span><p>Gevini was the "caller" who called those who served in the Mikdash.</p></div>
<div class="indent2"><span class="nm">1.</span><p>King Agripas heard him a distance of 8 Parsah.</p></div>
<div class="indent2"><span class="nm">2.</span><p>Agripas gave Gevini many gifts.</p></div>
<div class="indent1"><span class="nm">(c)</span><p>Ben Gever was appointed to the closing of the gates.</p></div>
<div class="indent2"><span class="nm">1.</span><p>Rav was the Metargem for Rav Shila (Yoma 20b) and explained Krias ha'Gever to refer to Gevini.</p></div>
<div class="indent2"><span class="nm">2.</span><p><span class="cl">Question:</span> Why not explain it to refer to a rooster?</p></div>
<div class="indent2"><span class="nm">3.</span><p><span class="cl">Answer:</span> We know that Ben <i>Gever</i> is a person!</p></div>
<div class="indent1"><span class="nm">(d)</span><p>Ben Bavi was over the bundles, who would match up the wicks.</p></div>
<div class="indent2"><span class="nm">1.</span><p>R. Yosi attempted to appoint administrators in a community.</p></div>
<div class="indent2"><span class="nm">2.</span><p>They declined, citing sources.</p></div>
<div class="indent2"><span class="nm">3.</span><p>He responded by citing the fact that Ben Bavi, with a relatively insignificant task, was included among the greats of his generation, how much more so those with critical appointments.</p></div>
<div class="indent1"><span class="nm">(e)</span><p>Ben Arzah was over the cymbals.</p></div>
<div class="indent2"><span class="nm">1.</span><p>His job, striking the note for the Leviim to begin their playing, is mentioned in the Beraisa.</p></div>
<div class="indent1"><span class="nm">(f)</span><p>Hugras Ben Levi (over the songs of the Leviim) had a magnificent voice, as described.</p></div>
<div class="indent1"><span class="nm">(g)</span><p>Beis Garmu over the Lechem ha'Panim.</p></div>
<div class="indent2"><span class="nm">1.</span><p>The story is recorded regarding this family's unique ability to bake the bread and remove it properly.</p></div>
<div class="indent2"><span class="nm">2.</span><p>Others were brought in an attempt to unseat them.</p></div>
<div class="indent2"><span class="nm">3.</span><p>They would not teach others so that the bread might never be made for idolatry by others.</p></div>
<div class="indent2"><span class="nm">4.</span><p>They never had clean bread, to be above suspicion.</p></div>
<div class="indent1"><span class="nm">(h)</span><p>Beis Avtinas over the Ketores.</p></div>
<div class="indent2"><span class="nm">1.</span><p>They, too, would not teach their craft to others, and others were, similarly, brought in.</p></div>
<div class="indent2"><span class="nm">2.</span><p>As with Beis Garmu, the newcomers could not match them (here, too, the differences are detailed).</p></div>
<div class="indent2"><span class="nm">3.</span><p>Here, too, their salaries were doubled to entice them to come back to their roles.</p></div>
<div class="indent2"><span class="nm">4.</span><p>They were never perfumed, to avoid suspicion.</p></div>
<div class="indent2"><span class="nm">5.</span><p>Still, there was a critique, as in the incident of the child of the house of Avtinas.</p></div>
<div class="indent2"><span class="nm">6.</span><p>Another incident with a child of the house of Avtinas spoke of their sensitivity to the honor of their family, the honor due to the righteous and to preserving their family secret.</p></div>
<div class="indent2"><span class="nm">7.</span><p>Their reputation was redeemed when an elder of their family passed the family secret to R. Yochanan b. Nuri.</p></div>

<div class="indent2"><span class="nm">2.</span><p>These answer to the King and the Kohen ha'Gadol.</p></div>
<div class="indent1"><span class="nm">(b)</span><p>When a treasury room was closed for later use, each authority, in ascending authority would seal the door with his seal.</p></div>
<div class="indent1"><span class="nm">(c)</span><p>This procedure was reversed to open the treasury, starting with the King who saw his seal undamaged and broke it, followed by the Kohen ha'Gadol, etc.</p></div>
<div class="subject"><span class="nm">4)</span><p>AUTHORITY GIVEN TO LESS THAN TWO</p></div>

<div class="indent1"><span class="nm">(c)</span><p>Korbanos of like quantities shared like tickets.</p></div>
<div class="indent1"><span class="nm">(d)</span><p>The procedure began with paying Yochanan and receiving a ticket.</p></div>
<div class="indent1"><span class="nm">(e)</span><p>The ticket was given to Ben Achyah who supplied the Nesachim.</p></div>
<div class="indent1"><span class="nm">(f)</span><p>At night Achyah brought the tickets to Yochanan and received his money (shortfalls were made up by Yochanan's personal funds) and overage went to Hekdesh.</p></div>
<div class="indent1"><span class="nm">(g)</span><p>If one lost his ticket he had to wait for the night's accounting.</p></div>

<div class="indent1"><span class="nm">(c)</span><p><span class="cl">Question:</span> What Nesachim are brought for a Rachel (female Ayil)?</p></div>
<div class="indent1"><span class="nm">(d)</span><p><span class="cl">Answer:</span> It can be inferred from the Mishnah (similar to the G'di, undifferentiated between young and mature, male and female).</p></div>
<div class="indent1"><span class="nm">(e)</span><p>This is derived from the Pasuk which declares the Nesachim of the Egel and Shor to be the same.</p></div>
