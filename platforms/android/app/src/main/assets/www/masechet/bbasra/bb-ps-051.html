<p class="bas subject"><span class="nm">1)</span>CHAZAKAH IN A WIFE'S PROPERTY</p>
<p class="bas indent1"><span class="nm">(a)</span><span class="cl">(Rav):</span> One cannot make a Chazakah in the property of a married woman!</p>
<p class="bas indent1"><span class="nm">(b)</span><span class="cl">(Judges of Chutz la'Aretz):</span> He can make a Chazakah.</p>
<p class="bas indent1"><span class="nm">(c)</span><span class="cl">(Rav):</span> The Halachah follows the judges of Chutz la'Aretz.</p>
<p class="bas indent1"><span class="nm">(d)</span><span class="cl">Rav Kahana and Rav Asi (to Rav):</span> Did you retract?</p>
<p class="bas indent1"><span class="nm">(e)</span><span class="cl">Rav:</span> No. Presumably, they discuss the case of Rav Yosef.</p>
<p class="bas subject"><span class="nm">2)</span>CHAZAKAH IN A HUSBAND'S PROPERTY</p>
<p class="bas indent1"><span class="nm">(a)</span><span class="cl">(Mishnah):</span> A woman cannot make a Chazakah in her husband's property...</p>
<p class="bas indent1"><span class="nm">(b)</span><span class="cl">Objection:</span> This is obvious! He allowed her to use the field because he must feed her!</p>
<p class="bas indent1"><span class="nm">(c)</span><span class="cl">Answer:</span> The case is, he designated another field from which she will be fed.</p>
<p class="bas indent1"><span class="nm">(d)</span><span class="cl">Inference:</span> She does not get a Chazakah in his property, but if she can prove that he sold it to her, she gets it!</p>
<p class="bas indent1"><span class="nm">(e)</span><span class="cl">Question:</span> Why can't he say 'I only pretended to sell it in order to get her to show the money that she took from me (and I took back my money)!'</p>
<p class="bas indent2"><span class="nm">1.</span><span class="cl">Suggestion:</span> This teaches that if one sells to his wife, she acquires, and he cannot say that he only pretended to sell it in order to get her to show the money that she took from him!</p>
<p class="bas indent1"><span class="nm">(f)</span><span class="cl">Answer:</span> No, perhaps she gets his property only if she can prove that he gave it to her (for free. Then, he cannot say that he only intended to get her to show money.)</p>
<p class="bas indent1"><span class="nm">(g)</span><span class="cl">(Rav Nachman):</span> If one sells to his wife, she acquires. He cannot say that he intended only to get hr to show the money that she took from him.</p>
<p class="bas indent1"><span class="nm">(h)</span><span class="cl">Objection (Rav Huna):</span> This is obvious! She acquires through the document of sale, even without the money (so he cannot say that wrote the document in order to get her to show the money)!</p>
<p class="bas indent2"><span class="nm">1.</span><span class="cl">(Mishnah):</span> Land is acquired through money, a document or Chazakah.</p>
<p class="bas indent1"><span class="nm">(i)</span><span class="cl">Answer:</span> Shmuel taught that a document by itself acquires a gift, but a sale is not final until the money is given.</p>
<p class="bas indent1"><span class="nm">(j)</span><span class="cl">Question:</span> This law was challenged!</p>
<p class="bas indent2"><span class="nm">1.</span><span class="cl">Question (Rav Hamnuna - Beraisa):</span> A document to acquire land: he writes on paper or pottery, even if it is not worth a Perutah, 'my field is sold or given to you.' The field is sold or given (even without the money)!</p>
<p class="bas indent1"><span class="nm">(k)</span><span class="cl">Answer:</span> Rav Hamnuna himself answered that!</p>
<p class="bas indent2"><span class="nm">1.</span><span class="cl">Answer #1 (Rav Hamnuna):</span> The Beraisa discusses a field sold due to its low quality. (Rav Nachman's law needed to teach about a normal field, which is not acquired until the money is given.)</p>
<p class="bas indent2"><span class="nm">2.</span><span class="cl">Answer #2 (Rav Ashi):</span> The document says 'sold and given.' The original owner wanted to give it for a gift. He also wrote 'sold' to accept Acharayos (to compensate the receiver if the land will be taken).</p>
<p class="bas indent1"><span class="nm">(l)</span><span class="cl">Question (Beraisa):</span> If Reuven borrowed from his slave and freed him, or borrowed from his wife and divorced her, the freed slave or ex-wife has no claim against him.</p>
<p class="bas indent2"><span class="nm">1.</span><span class="cl">Question:</span> What is the reason?</p>
<p class="bas indent2"><span class="nm">2.</span><span class="cl">Answer:</span> He can say 'I only pretended to borrow in order to get him or her to show the money that  he or she took from me!'</p>
<p class="bas indent1"><span class="nm">(m)</span><span class="cl">Answer:</span> Indeed, we say this regarding a loan, for people are very reluctant to borrow (so it is unlikely that he truly borrowed) - "Eved Loveh l'Ish Malveh";</p>
<p class="bas indent2"><span class="nm">1.</span>(Regarding a sale, we assume that the sale is valid.)</p>
<p class="bas indent1"><span class="nm">(n)</span><span class="cl">(Rav Huna bar Avin):</span> If one sells a field to his wife, she acquires. The husband eats the Peros.</p>
<p class="bas bbbline">51b----------------------------------------51b</p>
<p class="bas indent1"><span class="nm">(o)</span><span class="cl">(R. Aba, R. Avahu and the greatest Chachamim of the generation):</span> He really gave it for a gift (therefore, she eats the Peros). He wrote an expression of a sale to accept Acharayos (to compensate the receiver if the land will be taken).</p>
<p class="bas indent1"><span class="nm">(p)</span><span class="cl">Question (Beraisa):</span> If Reuven borrowed from his slave and freed him, or borrowed from his wife and divorced her, the freed slave or ex-wife has no claim against him.</p>
<p class="bas indent2"><span class="nm">1.</span><span class="cl">Question:</span> What is the reason?</p>
<p class="bas indent2"><span class="nm">2.</span><span class="cl">Answer:</span> He can say 'I only intended to get him or her to show the money he or she took from me!'</p>
<p class="bas indent1"><span class="nm">(q)</span><span class="cl">Answer:</span> We say so only regarding a loan, for "Eved Loveh..." (but we assume that a sale is valid).</p>
<p class="bas subject"><span class="nm">3)</span>WHO EATS THE PEROS OF A GIFT TO HIS WIFE?</p>
<p class="bas indent1"><span class="nm">(a)</span><span class="cl">(Rav):</span> If one sells a field to his wife, the sale is valid. He eats the Peros (like from any of her fields);</p>
<p class="bas indent2"><span class="nm">1.</span>If he gave to her a gift, the gift is valid and she eats the Peros. (This is an exception to the general rule that he eats the Peros of her property);</p>
<p class="bas indent1"><span class="nm">(b)</span><span class="cl">(R. Elazar):</span> In both cases (sales and gifts), she acquires and she eats the Peros.</p>
<p class="bas indent1"><span class="nm">(c)</span>A case occurred, and Rav Chisda ruled like R. Elazar.</p>
<p class="bas indent1"><span class="nm">(d)</span><span class="cl">Ravna Ukva and Ravna Nechemyah:</span> Why did you rule like the smaller Chacham against the greater (Rav, R. Elazar's Rebbi)?</p>
<p class="bas indent1"><span class="nm">(e)</span><span class="cl">Rav Chisda:</span> R. Yochanan agrees with R. Elazar. He is as great as Rav.</p>
<p class="bas indent2"><span class="nm">1.</span><span class="cl">(Ravin citing R. Yochanan):</span> In both cases, she acquires and she eats the Peros.</p>
<p class="bas indent1"><span class="nm">(f)</span><span class="cl">(Rava):</span> The Halachah is, if one sells a field to his wife, she does not acquire. He eats the Peros;</p>
<p class="bas indent2"><span class="nm">1.</span>If he gave to her a gift, she acquires and she eats the Peros;</p>
<p class="bas indent1"><span class="nm">(g)</span><span class="cl">Question:</span> Saying that he eats the Peros (in the case of a sale) implies that she acquires, but Rava said that she does not acquire!</p>
<p class="bas indent1"><span class="nm">(h)</span><span class="cl">Answer:</span> If he had not seen her money (he only pretended to sell in order to get her to show the money she took from him) she does not acquire;</p>
<p class="bas indent2"><span class="nm">1.</span>If he had seen her money, she acquires, but he eats the Peros (like Rav).</p>
<p class="bas indent2"><span class="nm">2.</span><span class="cl">(Rav Yehudah):</span> If he had not seen her money, she does not acquire. If he had seen her money, she acquires.</p>
<p class="bas subject"><span class="nm">4)</span>DEPOSITS THAT MAY HAVE BEEN STOLEN</p>
<p class="bas indent1"><span class="nm">(a)</span><span class="cl">(Beraisa):</span> We do not accept deposits from a (married) woman, slave or child (perhaps he or she stole it from his or her husband, owner or father);</p>
<p class="bas indent2"><span class="nm">1.</span>If Reuven took a deposit from a woman or slave, he returns it to him or her. If the woman or slave died, he returns it to the husband or owner;</p>
