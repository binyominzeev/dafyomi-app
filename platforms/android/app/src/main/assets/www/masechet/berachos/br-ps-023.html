<p class="bas subject"><span class="nm">1)</span>PEOPLE WHO MAY NOT PRAY</p>
<p class="bas indent1"><span class="nm">(a)</span><span class="cl">(Beraisa):</span> If during Shemoneh Esreh one [uncontrollably] started to urinate, he waits until the urine stops, then resumes his Shemoneh Esreh. (Some say that he must wait for his clothes to dry; Tosfos concludes, the Rabanan did not enact the prohibition when one is standing in the middle of Tefilah, and thus he need not wait.)</p>
<p class="bas indent1"><span class="nm">(b)</span><span class="cl">Question:</span> To which part of Shemoneh Esreh does he return?</p>
<p class="bas indent1"><span class="nm">(c)</span><span class="cl">Answer #1 (Rav Chisda or Rav Hamnuna):</span> He returns to the beginning;</p>
<p class="bas indent1"><span class="nm">(d)</span><span class="cl">Answer #2 (The other of Rav Chisda and Rav Hamnuna):</span> He returns to the place he stopped;</p>
<p class="bas indent1"><span class="nm">(e)</span><span class="cl">Question:</span> What do they argue about?</p>
<p class="bas indent1"><span class="nm">(f)</span><span class="cl">Answer #1:</span> The first opinion holds that if he delayed long enough to finish the entire Shemoneh Esreh, he returns to the beginning; the second opinion holds that he returns to the place he stopped.</p>
<p class="bas indent1"><span class="nm">(g)</span><span class="cl">Objection (Rav Ashi):</span> If so, they should say that they argue only when he delayed long enough to finish!</p>
<p class="bas indent1"><span class="nm">(h)</span><span class="cl">Answer #2 (Rav Ashi):</span> If he delayed long enough to finish, all agree that he returns to the beginning; they argue when he did not delay long enough to finish:</p>
<p class="bas indent2"><span class="nm">1.</span>The first opinion holds that [since he obviously had a strong need to urinate], he was unfit from praying from the start, therefore his prayer is invalid; the second opinion holds that he was not unfit, so his prayer is valid.</p>
<p class="bas indent1"><span class="nm">(i)</span><span class="cl">(Beraisa):</span> If one feels a need to defecate, he may not pray; if he prays, his prayer is an abomination.</p>
<p class="bas indent1"><span class="nm">(j)</span><span class="cl">Version #1 (Rav Zevid or Rav Yehudah):</span> This is only if he cannot wait (before relieving himself), but if he can wait, his prayer is valid.</p>
<p class="bas indent1"><span class="nm">(k)</span><span class="cl">Question:</span> How long must he be able to wait?</p>
<p class="bas indent1"><span class="nm">(l)</span><span class="cl">Answer (Rav Sheshes):</span> He must be able to wait the time it takes to walk a Parsah (about four kilometers, or 72 minutes).</p>
<p class="bas indent1"><span class="nm">(m)</span><span class="cl">Version #2 (continuation of Beraisa):</span> This is only if he cannot wait, but if he can wait, his prayer is valid.</p>
<p class="bas indent1"><span class="nm">(n)</span><span class="cl">Question:</span> How long must he be able to wait?</p>
<p class="bas indent1"><span class="nm">(o)</span><span class="cl">Answer (Rav Zevid):</span> He must be able to wait the time it takes to walk a Parsah.</p>
<p class="bas indent1"><span class="nm">(p)</span><span class="cl">(R. Shmuel bar Nachmani):</span> If one feels a need to move his bowels, he may not pray -- "Hikon Likras Elokecha Yisrael."</p>
<p class="bas indent1"><span class="nm">(q)</span><span class="cl">Question (R. Shmuel bar Nachmani):</span> What do we learn from "Shemor Raglecha Ka'asher Telech El Beis Elokim"?</p>
<p class="bas indent1"><span class="nm">(r)</span><span class="cl">Answer #1:</span> Guard yourself from sinning, lest you sin and need to go to the Mikdash to bring a Korban.</p>
<p class="bas indent2"><span class="nm">1.</span><span class="cl">(Rava):</span> "... U'Karov Lishmo'a" -- heed the Chachamim, who bring a Korban and repent (if they sin);</p>
<p class="bas indent2"><span class="nm">2.</span>"Mi'Tes ha'Kesilim Zevach" -- do not be like fools, who sin and bring a Korban without repenting.</p>
<p class="bas indent2"><span class="nm">3.</span><span class="cl">Question:</span> "Ki Einam Yod'im La'asos Ra" -- if so, they are Tzadikim!</p>
<p class="bas indent2"><span class="nm">4.</span><span class="cl">Answer (and retraction):</span> Rather, "mi'Tes ha'Kesilim..." -- do not be like fools, who sin and bring a Korban, but do not know which Korban to bring (they do not realize that they sinned and need to bring a Chatas);</p>
<p class="bas indent3"><span class="nm">i.</span><span class="cl">Hash-m:</span> They cannot distinguish between good and evil, and yet they bring a Korban before Me?!</p>
<p class="bas indent1"><span class="nm">(s)</span><span class="cl">Answer #2 (Rav Ashi):</span> "Shemor Raglecha..." -- guard yourself from passing wind when standing in front of Me in prayer.</p>
<p class="bas subject"><span class="nm">2)</span>REMOVING TEFILIN BEFORE ENTERING A BATHROOM</p>
<p class="bas indent1"><span class="nm">(a)</span>(A Beis ha'Kisei is an area (above ground) used as a privy; it is sometimes separated from the public thoroughfare by a wall.)</p>
<p class="bas indent1"><span class="nm">(b)</span><span class="cl">(Beraisa):</span> One who enters a Beis ha'Kisei to relieve himself removes his Tefilin four Amos before the Beis ha'Kisei.</p>
<p class="bas indent1"><span class="nm">(c)</span><span class="cl">(Rav Acha bar Rav Huna):</span> This applies only to a Beis ha'Kisei Kav'ua (it was established already as a Beis ha'Kisei, and there is excrement there), but if he will use a Beis ha'Kisei Arai (that has not been used before) he need not remove them in advance;</p>
<p class="bas indent2"><span class="nm">1.</span>Afterwards, he must go four Amos away before putting on the Tefilin, for he made the place into a Beis ha'Kisei Kavu'a.</p>
<p class="bas indent1"><span class="nm">(d)</span><span class="cl">Question:</span> May one enter a Beis ha'Kisei Kavu'a with Tefilin (on his head) in order to urinate?</p>
<p class="bas indent1"><span class="nm">(e)</span><span class="cl">Answer #1 (Ravina):</span> It is permitted.</p>
<p class="bas indent1"><span class="nm">(f)</span><span class="cl">Answer #2 (Rav Ada bar Masna):</span> It is forbidden.</p>
<p class="bas indent1"><span class="nm">(g)</span><span class="cl">Version #1 (Rava):</span> It is forbidden, lest he defecate.</p>
<p class="bas indent1"><span class="nm">(h)</span><span class="cl">Version #2 (Rava):</span> It is forbidden, lest he pass wind.</p>
<p class="bas indent1"><span class="nm">(i)</span><span class="cl">(Beraisa - Beis Shamai):</span> One who enters a Beis ha'Kisei removes his Tefilin four Amos before the Beis ha'Kisei, and leaves them in a window facing the public;</p>
<p class="bas indent2"><span class="nm">1.</span>Afterwards, he must walk four Amos away before donning the Tefilin.</p>
<p class="bas indent2"><span class="nm">2.</span>Beis Hillel says, he enters the Beis ha'Kisei holding the Tefilin in his hand;</p>
<p class="bas indent2"><span class="nm">3.</span>R. Akiva says, he enters holding the Tefilin in his garment.</p>
<p class="bas indent2"><span class="nm">4.</span><span class="cl">Objection:</span> This cannot be; perhaps he will forget that they are in his garment and drop them!</p>
<p class="bas indent2"><span class="nm">5.</span><span class="cl">Correction:</span> Rather, he enters holding the Tefilin in his hand and (i.e. wrapped) in his garment and leaves them in a crevice in the wall facing the Beis ha'Kisei.</p>
<p class="bas indent2"><span class="nm">6.</span>He should not leave them in a crevice in the wall facing the public, lest passers-by take them, leading people to suspect him (as in the following episode);</p>
<p class="bas indent3"><span class="nm">i.</span>A case occurred, Ploni (a Talmid) left his Tefilin in a crevice facing the public. A harlot took them, came to the Beis Medrash and claimed that Ploni gave them to her for her services; he went up to the roof and fell to his death. Consequently, Chachamim enacted that one should enter the Beis ha'Kisei holding hisTefilin in his hand and garment.</p>
<p class="bas indent1"><span class="nm">(j)</span><span class="cl">(Beraisa):</span> At first, people would leave Tefilin in a crevice facing the Beis ha'Kisei; mice used to take them. Chachamim enacted that one should leave them in a crevice facing the public; passers-by used to take them. They enacted that one should enter holding them in his hand and garment.</p>
<p class="bas indent1"><span class="nm">(k)</span><span class="cl">(R. Meyasha):</span> The Halachah is, one should wrap them (in the straps) like a Sefer Torah and hold them in his right hand opposite his heart.</p>
<p class="bas indent1"><span class="nm">(l)</span><span class="cl">(Rav Yosef bar Minyomi):</span> This is permitted only if the strap does not stick out a Tefach from his hand.</p>
<p class="bas indent1"><span class="nm">(m)</span><span class="cl">(R. Yakov bar Acha):</span> This (R. Meyasha's ruling) applies only if there will be time to wear them again during the day. If not, he puts them in a bag whose interior is at least a Tefach (this is a proper separation from the ground).</p>
<p class="bas indent1"><span class="nm">(n)</span>(This is like our text, and Rashi. Some texts put this after the following teaching, i.e. R. Yakov qualifies what Rabah means when he said "during the day.")</p>
<p class="bas indent1"><span class="nm">(o)</span><span class="cl">(Rabah bar bar Chanah):</span> During the day one [who enters a Beis ha'Kisei] should wrap them like a Sefer Torah and hold them in his hand opposite his heart; at night, he puts them in a bag of at least a Tefach.</p>
<p class="bas indent1"><span class="nm">(p)</span><span class="cl">(Abaye):</span> The bag must be a Tefach only if its only usage is for Tefilin (for then it is subordinate to them, unless it is considered an Ohel); if not, it may be smaller.</p>
<p class="bas indent1"><span class="nm">(q)</span><span class="cl">Support (Mar Zutra):</span> Small (tightly sealed) earthenware vessels in an Ohel ha'Mes shield their contents from Tum'ah (even though they are less than a Tefach).</p>
<p class="bas indent1"><span class="nm">(r)</span><span class="cl">(Rabah bar bar Chanah):</span> When we were with R. Yochanan and he needed to go to the Beis ha'Kisei:</p>
<p class="bas indent2"><span class="nm">1.</span>If he was holding a Sefer of Agadah, he would give it to us to hold; if he was holding Tefilin, he would not give it to us;</p>
<p class="bas indent3"><span class="nm">i.</span>He preferred to take them with him; since Chachamim permitted this, he wanted the Tefilin to protect him (from Mazikin).</p>

<p class="bas indent1"><span class="nm">(s)</span>Rava testified similarly about Rav Nachman.</p>
<p class="bas subject"><span class="nm">3)</span>LAWS THAT APPLY IN A <i>BEIS HA'KISEI</i></p>
<p class="bas indent1"><span class="nm">(a)</span><span class="cl">(Beraisa):</span> One may not pray while holding Tefilin in his hand or a Sefer Torah in his arm.</p>
<p class="bas indent2"><span class="nm">1.</span>Also, while holding Tefilin it is forbidden to urinate or sleep, neither a fixed sleep nor a nap (Gra - lest he drop them; according to our text of Rashi - one may not sleep while <i>wearing</i> Tefilin, lest he pass wind.)</p>
<p class="bas indent1"><span class="nm">(b)</span><span class="cl">(Shmuel):</span> The same applies to holding a knife, coins, bowl (of food) or loaf of bread.</p>
<p class="bas indent1"><span class="nm">(c)</span><span class="cl">(Rava):</span> The Halachah does not follow this Beraisa, it is like Beis Shamai;</p>
<p class="bas indent2"><span class="nm">1.</span>It cannot be like Beis Hillel -- they permit holding Tefilin in a Beis ha'Kisei Kavu'a, all the more so in a Beis ha'Kisei Arai (normally, one does not bother to go to a Beis ha'Kisei Kavu'a just to urinate)!</p>
<p class="bas indent1"><span class="nm">(d)</span><span class="cl">Question (Beraisa #1):</span> Things which are permitted elsewhere are forbidden here.</p>
<p class="bas indent2"><span class="nm">1.</span><span class="cl">Suggestion:</span> This refers to Tefilin.</p>
<p class="bas indent2"><span class="nm">2.</span>We understand if the Beraisa is like Beis Hillel -- even though Tefilin are permitted in a Beis ha'Kisei Kavu'a, they are forbidden in a Beis ha'Kisei Arai;</p>
<p class="bas indent3"><span class="nm">i.</span>But it cannot be Beis Shamai -- they do not permit either!</p>
<p class="bas indent1"><span class="nm">(e)</span><span class="cl">Answer:</span> The Beraisa discusses exposing oneself one or two Tefachim:</p>
<p class="bas indent2"><span class="nm">1.</span><span class="cl">(Beraisa #2):</span> One who relieves himself may expose himself one Tefach in back and two Tefachim in front.</p>
<p class="bas indent2"><span class="nm">2.</span><span class="cl">Contradiction (Beraisa #3):</span> He may expose himself one Tefach in back, but not at all in front.</p>
<p class="bas indent2"><span class="nm">3.</span><span class="cl">Resolution #1:</span> Both of these discuss a man -- Beraisa #2 discusses urinating, Beraisa #3 discusses defecating.</p>
<p class="bas indent2"><span class="nm">4.</span><span class="cl">Rejection:</span> There is no need to expose oneself in back to urinate! (Why, then, does Beraisa #2 allow a Tefach?)</p>
<p class="bas indent2"><span class="nm">5.</span><span class="cl">Resolution #2:</span> Rather, both discuss defecating -- Beraisa #2 discusses a woman, Beraisa #3 discusses a man.</p>
<p class="bas indent2"><span class="nm">6.</span><span class="cl">(Summation of answer:</span> Beraisa #1 means exposing oneself in front, which is permitted for a woman and is forbidden for a man).</p>
<p class="bas indent1"><span class="nm">(f)</span><span class="cl">Question (Seifa of Beraisa #1):</span> This law is against a Kal va'Chomer that cannot be answered!</p>
<p class="bas indent2"><span class="nm">1.</span>If Beraisa #1 refers to how much men and women may expose themselves, this is not subject to a Kal va'Chomer, it is on account of their anatomy!</p>
<p class="bas indent1"><span class="nm">(g)</span>Rava is refuted.</p>
<p class="bas indent1"><span class="nm">(h)</span><span class="cl">Question:</span> If Tefilin are permitted in a Beis ha'Kisei Kavu'a, why are they forbidden in a Beis ha'Kisei Arai?</p>
<p class="bas indent1"><span class="nm">(i)</span><span class="cl">Answer:</span> One who urinates must clean the drops off of his shoes (lest people suspect that he does not urinate properly, a sign of sterility, and this will cause suspicion about his children), therefore he cannot hold Tefilin; this does not apply to defecating.</p>
<p class="bas indent1"><span class="nm">(j)</span><span class="cl">Question:</span> This is a good answer. Why does the Beraisa say that the Kal va'Chomer cannot be answered?</p>
<p class="bas indent1"><span class="nm">(k)</span><span class="cl">Answer:</span> It means, this law depends on a particular reason, not on a Kal va'Chomer -- if it was based on the Kal va'Chomer, it would be permitted!</p>
<p class="bas subject"><span class="nm">4)</span>GUARDING TEFILIN WHEN NOT WEARING THEM</p>
<p class="bas indent1"><span class="nm">(a)</span><span class="cl">(Beraisa):</span> Before beginning a proper meal, one should walk four Amos ten times, or ten Amos four times, and relieve himself. (It is a disgrace to have to leave in the middle of a meal.)</p>
<p class="bas indent1"><span class="nm">(b)</span><span class="cl">(R. Yitzchak):</span> One removes his Tefilin before beginning a proper meal (lest he get drunk and disgrace them).</p>
<p class="bas indent1"><span class="nm">(c)</span>This is unlike R. Chiya.</p>
<p class="bas indent2"><span class="nm">1.</span><span class="cl">(R. Chiya):</span> He should leave them on the table; this is a proper thing for him to do (so they will be ready for him to wear).</p>
<p class="bas indent1"><span class="nm">(d)</span><span class="cl">Question:</span> Until when should one not wear them at a meal?</p>
<p class="bas indent1"><span class="nm">(e)</span><span class="cl">Answer (Rav Nachman bar Yitzchak):</span> Until he says Birkas ha'Mazon.</p>
<p class="bas indent1"><span class="nm">(f)</span><span class="cl">(Beraisa #1):</span> One may wrap his Tefilin and coins in [different parts of] his turban.</p>
<p class="bas indent1"><span class="nm">(g)</span><span class="cl">Contradiction (Beraisa #2):</span> One may not wrap them [together].</p>
<p class="bas indent1"><span class="nm">(h)</span><span class="cl">Resolution:</span> Beraisa #2 discusses when he designated the turban for Tefilin, Beraisa #1 discusses when he did not.</p>
<p class="bas indent2"><span class="nm">1.</span><span class="cl">(Rav Chisda):</span> If a turban was designated for Tefilin and used for Tefilin, it may not be used for coins;</p>
<p class="bas indent2"><span class="nm">2.</span>If it was designated but not [yet] used for Tefilin, or used but not designated for Tefilin, it may be used for coins.</p>
<p class="bas indent2"><span class="nm">3.</span>Abaye holds that designation is significant; he says, if it was designated, even if it was not used, it may not be used for coins;</p>
<p class="bas indent2"><span class="nm">4.</span>If it was used for Tefilin, it may be used for coins unless it was designated for Tefilin.</p>
<p class="bas indent1"><span class="nm">(i)</span><span class="cl">Question (Rav Yosef brei d'Rav Nechunya):</span> May one put Tefilin under his head (when sleeping at night)?</p>
<p class="bas indent2"><span class="nm">1.</span>I need not ask about under his feet, for that is disgraceful.</p>
<p class="bas indent1"><span class="nm">(j)</span><span class="cl">Answer (Rav Yehudah citing Shmuel):</span> It is permitted, even if his wife is with him (and they might have relations).</p>
<p class="bas indent1"><span class="nm">(k)</span><span class="cl">Question (Beraisa):</span> It is forbidden to put Tefilin under one's feet, for that is disgraceful;</p>
<p class="bas indent2"><span class="nm">1.</span>Under the head is permitted;</p>
<p class="bas indent2"><span class="nm">2.</span>If his wife is with him it is forbidden, unless they are on a place three Tefachim above or below his head.</p>
<p class="bas indent1"><span class="nm">(l)</span>Shmuel is refuted.</p>
<p class="bas indent1"><span class="nm">(m)</span><span class="cl">(Rava):</span> Even though Shmuel is refuted, the Halachah follows him.</p>
<p class="bas indent1"><span class="nm">(n)</span><span class="cl">Question:</span> What is the reason?</p>
<p class="bas indent1"><span class="nm">(o)</span><span class="cl">Answer:</span> It is preferable that they be guarded well (from mice and thieves), even if there is disgrace.</p>
