<p class="dedicationbox">ERCHIN 16 - Two weeks of study material have been dedicated by Mrs. Estanne Abraham Fawer to honor the twelfth Yahrzeit of her father, Rav Mordechai ben Eliezer Zvi (Rabbi Morton Weiner) Z'L, who passed away on 18 Teves 5760. May the merit of supporting and advancing Dafyomi study -- which was so important to him -- during the weeks of his Yahrzeit serve as an Iluy for his Neshamah. </p>

<p class="bas subject"><span class="nm">1)</span>LASHON HA'RA</p>
<p class="bas indent1"><span class="nm">(a)</span><span class="cl">(Rabah bar Rav Huna):</span> Anything said in front of three people is not Lashon ha'Ra. (One may tell it to others. Tosfos - this refers to statements like "where will you find fire... ," which can be understood in a positive or negative way. She'altos (Vayeshev 28, b'Sof) - normally, one needs permission to repeat anything he was told. If it was told in front of three, this is like permission. Ha'Emek She'alah says that Rashi explains similarly. Rashbam (Bava Basra Sof 39a) - if Reuven spoke about Shimon in front of three, they may tell the matter to Shimon. This teaching is brought there regarding a protest that Shimon is using Reuven's land without permission.)</p>
<p class="bas indent1"><span class="nm">(b)</span><span class="cl">Question:</span> What is the reason?</p>
<p class="bas indent1"><span class="nm">(c)</span><span class="cl">Answer:</span> The speaker knows that one who hears will tell his friend, and he will tell his friend, and surely everyone will eventually hear about it. (Tosfos - therefore, surely he says it in a positive way.)</p>
<p class="bas indent1"><span class="nm">(d)</span><span class="cl">(Rav Dimi):</span> "Mevarech Re'ehu b'Kol Gadol ba'Boker Haskem Kelalah Techashev Lo" is one who received nice hospitality and publicly blesses his host who toiled so much for him. People hear this, and take his money. (Powerful people hear of his wealth, and take it by force. Alternatively, he is inundated with guests until his money is consumed.)</p>
<p class="bas indent1"><span class="nm">(e)</span><span class="cl">Version #1 (Rav Dimi, Rav Safra's brother):</span> One should never speak (Rashi - too) highly of a person (Rambam - in front of people who hate him), lest the speaker or a listener point out a flaw in the person.</p>
<p class="bas indent1"><span class="nm">(f)</span><span class="cl">Version #2:</span> Rav Dimi fell ill. Rav Safra came to visit.</p>
<p class="bas indent2"><span class="nm">1.</span><span class="cl">Rav Dimi:</span> I fulfilled every mid'Rabanan law.</p>
<p class="bas indent2"><span class="nm">2.</span><span class="cl">Rav Safra:</span> Did you fulfill not speaking highly of Ploni, lest the speaker or a listener point out a flaw in Ploni? (Ben Yehoyada - Rav Dimi held that people should discuss the praises of a sick person to arouse his merits. Rav Safra held that even others should not do so, lest it arouse harsh judgments, all the more so the Choleh himself should not!)</p>
<p class="bas indent2"><span class="nm">3.</span><span class="cl">Rav Dimi:</span> I did not hear this until now. Had I heard it, I would have fulfilled it.</p>
<p class="bas subject"><span class="nm">2)</span>CAUSES OF <i>TZARA'AS</i></p>
<p class="bas indent1"><span class="nm">(a)</span><span class="cl">(R. Shmuel bar Nachmani):</span> Tzara'as comes due to seven things - Lashon ha'Ra, murder, false or vain oaths, Giluy Arayos, haughtiness, theft, and stinginess:</p>
<p class="bas indent2"><span class="nm">1.</span>It comes for Lashon ha'Ra - "Melashni va'Saser Re'ehu Oso Atzmis." (We said (15b) that this alludes to Tzara'as);</p>
<p class="bas indent2"><span class="nm">2.</span>It comes for murder - "v'Al Yichras mi'Beis Yo'av";</p>
<p class="bas indent2"><span class="nm">3.</span>It comes for false or vain oaths. It says "va'Yomer Na'aman Ho'el Kach Kikarim" (Gechazi accepted the oath), and it says "v'Tzara'as Na'aman Tidbak Becha";</p>
<p class="bas indent2"><span class="nm">4.</span>It comes for Giluy Arayos - "va'Ynaga Hash-m Es Par'o Nega'im";</p>
<p class="bas indent2"><span class="nm">5.</span>It comes for haughtiness. Regarding Uziyahu it says "uch'Chezkaso Gavah Libo," and it says "veha'Tzara'as Zorchah v'Mitzcho";</p>
<p class="bas indent2"><span class="nm">6.</span>It comes for theft - "vTzivah ha'Kohen u'Finu Es ha'Bayis" (when Tzara'as comes on a house, all the Kelim are removed from it);</p>
<p class="bas indent3"><span class="nm">i.</span><span class="cl">(Beraisa):</span> The owner of the house gathered money that was not his, therefore the Kohen scatters his money.</p>
<p class="bas indent2"><span class="nm">7.</span>It comes for stinginess - "u'Va Asher <i>Lo</i> ha'Bayis";</p>
<p class="bas indent3"><span class="nm">i.</span><span class="cl">(Beraisa - Tana d'Vei R. Yishmael):</span> This refers to one who considers his house to be exclusively his. (He does not lend his possessions.)</p>
<p class="bas indent1"><span class="nm">(b)</span><span class="cl">Question:</span> Bigdei Kehunah atone (for Lashon ha'Ra; Tosfos - and murder and Arayos). Why does Tzara'as come for these matters?</p>
<p class="bas indent2"><span class="nm">1.</span><span class="cl">Question (R. Anani bar Sason):</span> Why did the Torah write the Parshah of Korbanos next to that of Bigdei Kehunah?</p>
<p class="bas indent2"><span class="nm">2.</span><span class="cl">Answer:</span> This teaches that just like Korbanos atone for sins, also Bigdei Kehunah.</p>
<p class="bas indent2"><span class="nm">3.</span>The Kesones atones for murder - (when Yosef's brothers planned to kill him) "va'Yitbelu Es ha'Kutones ba'Dam."</p>
<p class="bas indent2"><span class="nm">4.</span>The Michnesayim atone for Giluy Arayos - "... Michnesei Vad Lechasos (cover up) Besar Ervah";</p>
<p class="bas indent2"><span class="nm">5.</span>The Mitznefes atones for haughtiness, like R. Chanina taught:</p>
<p class="bas indent3"><span class="nm">i.</span><span class="cl">(R. Chanina):</span> It is proper that something worn at the highest place (the head) atones for elevating oneself.</p>
<p class="bas indent2"><span class="nm">6.</span>The Avnet atones for thoughts of the heart, for it is worn there.</p>
<p class="bas indent2"><span class="nm">7.</span>The Choshen atones for (corrupting) judgment - "v'Asisa Choshen <i>Mishpat</i>."</p>
<p class="bas indent2"><span class="nm">8.</span>The Efod atones for idolatry - "v'Ein Efod u'Serafim." (This implies that when there is an Efod, there is no (liability for) idolatry.)</p>
<p class="bas indent2"><span class="nm">9.</span>The Me'il atones for Lashon ha'Ra;</p>
<p class="bas indent3"><span class="nm">i.</span>It is proper that something with a voice (the bells on the Me'il are heard when the Kohen Gadol walks) atone for misuse of voice.</p>
<p class="bas indent2"><span class="nm">10.</span>The Tzitz atones for audacity - "v'Hayah Al Metzach Aharon";</p>
<p class="bas indent3"><span class="nm">i.</span>The forehead is where audacity is seen - "u'Metzach Ishah Zonah Hayah Lach."</p>
<p class="bas indent1"><span class="nm">(c)</span><span class="cl">Answer:</span> The Me'il atones if the Lashon ha'Ra did not succeed (to cause a feud). If it did, Tzara'as comes. (Tosfos - also, Michnesayim and Kesones atone for transgressions that are considered like Arayos and murder (e.g. humiliating someone) - if the actual transgression was done, Tzara'as comes.)</p>
<p class="bas indent1"><span class="nm">(d)</span><span class="cl">Question:</span> R. Simon taught that two transgressions have atonements other than Korbanos: murder and Lashon ha'Ra;</p>
<p class="bas indent2"><span class="nm">1.</span>Eglah Arufah atones for murder, and Ketores atones for Lashon ha'Ra.</p>
<p class="bas indent2"><span class="nm">2.</span><span class="cl">(Beraisa - R. Chanina):</span> Ketores atones for Lashon ha'Ra - "va'Yiten Es ha'Ketores va'Yechaper Al ha'Am." (Bnei Yisrael had spoken Lashon ha'Ra about Moshe and Aharon.)</p>
<p class="bas indent2"><span class="nm">3.</span><span class="cl">(Beraisa - Tana d'Vei R. Yishmael):</span> Ketores atones for Lashon ha'Ra. It is offered covertly (in the Heichal), so it atones for things said covertly.</p>
<p class="bas indent2"><span class="nm">4.</span><span class="cl">Summation of question:</span> Above, we said that the Ketores and Me'il atone for murder and Lashon ha'Ra!</p>
<p class="bas indent1"><span class="nm">(e)</span><span class="cl">Answer - part 1:</span> We can resolve murder. Eglah Arufah atones (for Bnei Yisrael) when we do not know who was the murderer, and the Ketores atones when we know.</p>
<p class="bas indent2"><span class="nm">1.</span><span class="cl">Question:</span> If we know the murderer, we kill him! (No other atonement is needed.)</p>
<p class="bas indent2"><span class="nm">2.</span><span class="cl">Answer:</span> The case is, we cannot execute him, for he was (Mezid but was) not warned.</p>
<p class="bas indent1"><span class="nm">(f)</span><span class="cl">Answer - part 2:</span> We can resolve Lashon ha'Ra. The Ketores atones for covert Lashon ha'Ra, and the Me'il atones for Lashon ha'Ra said in public.</p>
<p class="bas bbbline">16b----------------------------------------16b</p>
<p class="bas indent1"><span class="nm">(g)</span><span class="cl">Question (R. Shmuel bar Nadav):</span> Why is Metzora different than other Teme'im - "Badad Yeshev mi'Chutz la'Machaneh Moshavo"?</p>
<p class="bas indent1"><span class="nm">(h)</span><span class="cl">Answer (R. Chanina):</span> He separated (through speaking Lashon ha'Ra) between a man and his wife, or between a man and his friend, therefore he must sit alone.</p>
<p class="bas indent1"><span class="nm">(i)</span><span class="cl">Question (R. Yehoshua ben Levi):</span> Why does the Torah require a Metzora to bring "Shtei Tziporim" for his Taharah?</p>
<p class="bas indent1"><span class="nm">(j)</span><span class="cl">Answer:</span> He did an act of gossip, therefore he brings birds, which always chirp.</p>
<p class="bas subject"><span class="nm">3)</span>REBUKE</p>
<p class="bas indent1"><span class="nm">(a)</span><span class="cl">(Beraisa) Suggestion:</span> Perhaps "Lo Sisna Es Achicha bi'Levavecha" forbids to hit, slap, or curse (Rashi - when rebuking for transgressions)!</p>
<p class="bas indent2"><span class="nm">1.</span><span class="cl">Rejection:</span> "Bi'Lvavecha" teaches that only hatred (concealed) in the heart is forbidden (Rambam - due to this Lav; Rashi - when rebuking).</p>
<p class="bas indent2"><span class="nm">2.</span><span class="cl">Question:</span> What is the source that if one sees someone do something improper, he must rebuke him?</p>
<p class="bas indent2"><span class="nm">3.</span><span class="cl">Answer:</span> It says "Hoche'ah Tochi'ach."</p>
<p class="bas indent2"><span class="nm">4.</span><span class="cl">Question:</span> What is the source that if he did not accept the rebuke, he must rebuke him again?</p>
<p class="bas indent2"><span class="nm">5.</span><span class="cl">Answer:</span> It says "Tochi'ach", in any case.</p>
<p class="bas indent2"><span class="nm">6.</span><span class="cl">Suggestion:</span> Perhaps this is even if the transgressor will blush from embarrassment!</p>
<p class="bas indent2"><span class="nm">7.</span><span class="cl">Rejection:</span> It says "v'Lo Sisa Alav Chet."</p>
<p class="bas indent1"><span class="nm">(b)</span><span class="cl">R. Tarfon:</span> I would be amazed if there was anyone in this generation that can receive (Shitah Mekubetzes - give) rebuke:</p>
<p class="bas indent2"><span class="nm">1.</span>If Ploni would rebuke Almoni for a small transgression, Almoni would rebuke Ploni for a great transgression.</p>
<p class="bas indent1"><span class="nm">(c)</span><span class="cl">R. Elazar ben Azaryah:</span> I would be amazed if there was anyone in this generation that knows how to (properly) rebuke.</p>
<p class="bas indent1"><span class="nm">(d)</span><span class="cl">R. Yochanan ben Nuri:</span> I testify about R. Akiva. Often he was lashed due to me, for I told R. Gamliel about his misconduct, and he loved me more for this - "Al Tochach Letz Pen Yisna'echa Hochah l'Chacham v'Ye'ehavecha." (Ben Yehoyada - R. Akiva often came late to the Beis Medrash because he was reviewing his learning, but he did not say so. It was the custom to hit Talmidim who came late.)</p>
<p class="bas indent1"><span class="nm">(e)</span><span class="cl">Question (R. Yehudah brei d'R. Shimon ben Pazi):</span> Which is better - rebuke Lishmah (l'Shem Shamayim), or humility Lo Lishmah? (One refrains from rebuking, lest it arouse hatred (Rashi; Sefas Emes - lest he be rebuked for his sins; Tzon Kodashim - for he does not want to make himself above the transgresser. Tosfos - humility Lo Lishmah is acting humbly to become respected.)</p>
<p class="bas indent1"><span class="nm">(f)</span><span class="cl">Answer (R. Shimon ben Pazi):</span> You admit that humility Lishmah is better than rebuke. It was taught that humility is greater than all the levels in Avodas Hash-m;</p>
<p class="bas indent2"><span class="nm">1.</span>Therefore, also humility Lo Lishmah is better!</p>
<p class="bas indent2"><span class="nm">2.</span><span class="cl">(Rav Yehudah):</span> One should always engage in Torah and Mitzvos even Lo Lishmah, for this will lead him to do them Lishmah.</p>
<p class="bas indent1"><span class="nm">(g)</span><span class="cl">Question:</span> What is an example of (a choice between) rebuke Lishmah and humility Lo Lishmah?</p>
<p class="bas indent1"><span class="nm">(h)</span><span class="cl">Answer:</span> Rav Huna illustrates this:</p>
<p class="bas indent2"><span class="nm">1.</span>Rav Huna and Chiya bar Rav were sitting in front of Shmuel. Chiya complained "see how Rav Huna is paining me!"</p>
<p class="bas indent2"><span class="nm">2.</span>Rav Huna agreed not to pain him again.</p>
<p class="bas indent2"><span class="nm">3.</span>After Chiya left, Rav Huna told Shmuel that he pained Chiya due to transgressions.</p>

<p class="bas indent2"><span class="nm">5.</span><span class="cl">Rav Huna:</span> I did not want to (give rebuke Lishmah, for it would) embarrass the seed of (my Rebbi,) Rav. (Rather, he refrained from rebuke, Lo Lishmah.)</p>

<p class="bas indent1"><span class="nm">(a)</span><span class="cl">Question:</span> How much must one endure before changing his lodging?</p>
<p class="bas indent1"><span class="nm">(b)</span><span class="cl">Answer #1 (Rav):</span> He should not change until the host is ready to hit;</p>
<p class="bas indent1"><span class="nm">(c)</span><span class="cl">Answer #2 (Shmuel):</span> He should not change until the host is preparing to throw his belongings outside.</p>
<p class="bas indent1"><span class="nm">(d)</span>They do not argue if the host is ready to hit <i>him</i> or throw <i>his</i> belongings outside. (Surely, this is grounds to change.) They argue about if the host is ready to hit his wife. (Seemingly, it refers to the host's wife. However, R. Gershom, and Rashi in Ein Yakov, explain that it refers to the guest's wife.)</p>
<p class="bas indent2"><span class="nm">1.</span>Shmuel says that this is not grounds to change, since the guest himself is not affected;</p>
<p class="bas indent2"><span class="nm">2.</span>Rav says that this is grounds to change, lest he come to quarrel with the host.</p>
<p class="bas indent1"><span class="nm">(e)</span><span class="cl">Question:</span> Why should one endure so much before changing his lodging?</p>
<p class="bas indent1"><span class="nm">(f)</span><span class="cl">Answer:</span> Changing reflects badly on the host and guest (that they could not get along).</p>

<p class="bas indent2"><span class="nm">5.</span><span class="cl">Answer:</span> They argue about whether one must try to avoid changing a incidental (chance) lodging. (R. Yosi is concerned. Rav Yehudah is concerned only for fixed lodgings, like "Ohalo".)</p>
<p class="bas indent1"><span class="nm">(g)</span><span class="cl">(R. Yochanan):</span> One should not change from his (father's) profession and that of his ancestors. "Chiram mi'Tzor Ben Ishah Almanah Hu mi'Mateh Naftali v'Aviv Ish Tzori Choresh Nechoshes" made copper Kelim for Bayis Rishon;</p>
<p class="bas indent2"><span class="nm">1.</span>It was taught that his mother was from Dan, the Shevet of Ohali'av, who helped Betzalel to build the Mishkan and its Kelim.
