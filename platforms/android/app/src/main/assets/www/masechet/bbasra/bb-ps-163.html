<p class="dedicationbox">BAVA BASRA 163 (10 Tamuz) - Dedicated by Rabbi and Mrs. Mordecai Kornfeld in honor of the Bar Mitzvah of their son, Yosef Kornfeld </p>

<p class="bas subject"><span class="nm">1)</span>BLANK LINES AFTER THE TEXT</p>
<p class="bas indent1"><span class="nm">(a)</span><span class="cl">Question:</span> We say that two blank lines invalidate a document. Does this mean the amount for two lines of text and the space between them, or without the space?</p>
<p class="bas indent1"><span class="nm">(b)</span><span class="cl">Answer:</span> Presumably, it means the amount for two lines and the space between them;</p>
<p class="bas indent2"><span class="nm">1.</span><span class="cl">Version #1 (our text, Tosfos):</span> If it were without the space, obviously, there is no concern for one line! (Beraisa #1 would not need to teach that one blank line does not disqualify.)</p>
<p class="bas indent2"><span class="nm">2.</span><span class="cl">Version #2 (Rashbam):</span> If it were without the space, there is no concern (for two blank lines. If he will add one line of text, we do not learn from it. If he will add two lines, he must write them smaller than the rest of the document, or not leave space between them. In either case, the forgery would be evident!)</p>
<p class="bas indent1"><span class="nm">(c)</span><span class="cl">(Rav Shabsi):</span> The two blank lines that invalidate a document are gauged according to the way witnesses write, and not the way a scribe writes (which is smaller).</p>
<p class="bas indent1"><span class="nm">(d)</span><span class="cl">Question:</span> What is the reason?</p>
<p class="bas indent1"><span class="nm">(e)</span><span class="cl">Answer:</span> Presumably, a swindler must forge by himself, for a scribe would not agree. Regular people cannot write as small as scribes can.</p>
<p class="bas indent1"><span class="nm">(f)</span><span class="cl">Question:</span> What size space invalidates a document?</p>
<p class="bas indent1"><span class="nm">(g)</span><span class="cl">Answer #1 (Rav Yitzchak ben Elazar):</span> (Room for two lines with spaces above and below, so the letters will never touch letters of other lines, i.e.) enough so even if 'Lecha' is written in each line ('Lamed' extends above the line, final 'Chaf' extends below the line, and the final 'Chaf' in the top line and the 'Lamed' in the bottom line are aligned, they will not touch each other; also, the final 'Chaf' in the bottom line and the 'Lamed' in the top line will not touch the line above or below the blank lines).</p>
<p class="bas indent2"><span class="nm">1.</span>He requires room for two lines and four spaces (a separate space above and below each line).</p>
<p class="bas indent1"><span class="nm">(h)</span><span class="cl">Answer #2 (R. Chiya bar Ami):</span> They are enough so even if a 'Lamed' is in the top line, and a final 'Chaf' is in the bottom line (they will not touch the line above or below the blank lines).</p>
<p class="bas indent2"><span class="nm">1.</span>He requires room for two lines and three spaces (a space above and below each line, but one space suffices for between the two lines, a forger can arrange that no 'Lamed' is under a letter that extends below the line).</p>
<p class="bas indent1"><span class="nm">(i)</span><span class="cl">Answer #3 (R. Avahu):</span> They are enough to write one line with a 'Lamed' and a final 'Chaf'.</p>
<p class="bas indent2"><span class="nm">1.</span>He requires room for one line and two spaces. (R. Yonah - this is enough to forge two lines - surely, he argues with Rav Shabsi, who says that we consider two lines the way witnesses write.)</p>
<p class="bas subject"><span class="nm">2)</span>WHEN SPACE DISQUALIFIES A DOCUMENT</p>
<p class="bas indent1"><span class="nm">(a)</span><span class="cl">(Rav):</span> We are only concerned for space between the text and the witnesses, but even a large space between the witnesses and the validation (of Beis Din) does not disqualify it.</p>
<p class="bas indent1"><span class="nm">(b)</span><span class="cl">Question:</span> We are concerned for space between the text and the witnesses, lest the bearer add clauses (and the signatures will be underneath);</p>
<p class="bas indent2"><span class="nm">1.</span>We should also be concerned for space between the witnesses and the validation, lest he write a document there, and the signatures of Beis Din will be underneath!</p>
<p class="bas indent1"><span class="nm">(c)</span><span class="cl">Answer:</span> Rav only allowed a space there if it is smudged with ink (so nothing can be written there).</p>
<p class="bas indent1"><span class="nm">(d)</span><span class="cl">Question:</span> Also between the text and the witnesses, a space smudged with ink should not disqualify a document!</p>
<p class="bas indent1"><span class="nm">(e)</span><span class="cl">Answer:</span> No, we are concerned lest the witnesses signed under the smudge and did not intend to testify about the text.</p>
<p class="bas indent1"><span class="nm">(f)</span><span class="cl">Question:</span> Likewise, we should be concerned lest Beis Din signed under the smudge and did not intend to validate the document!</p>
<p class="bas indent1"><span class="nm">(g)</span><span class="cl">Answer:</span> A Beis Din would never do this.</p>
<p class="bas indent1"><span class="nm">(h)</span><span class="cl">Question:</span> We should be concerned for a smudge between the witnesses and the validation, lest he cut off the top (the document and witnesses), erase the smudged area, write a document, forge signatures, and it will have a validation of Beis Din below it!</p>
<p class="bas indent2"><span class="nm">1.</span><span class="cl">(Rav):</span> If a document and the signatures are both on erased parchment, it is valid.</p>
<p class="bas bbbline">163b----------------------------------------163b</p>
<p class="bas indent1"><span class="nm">(i)</span><span class="cl">Answer #1:</span> According to Rav Kahana, who cited the above law in Shmuel's name, we can say that Rav disqualifies such a document.</p>
<p class="bas indent1"><span class="nm">(j)</span><span class="cl">Question:</span> Rav Tavyomi cited it in Rav's name - how can we answer?</p>
<p class="bas indent1"><span class="nm">(k)</span><span class="cl">Answer:</span> He holds that we do not rely on validations of documents on erased parchment (a Beis Din will not act according to the document until it itself validates it).</p>
<p class="bas indent1"><span class="nm">(l)</span><span class="cl">(R. Yochanan):</span> Two blank lines between the text and the witnesses invalid a document, but even one blank line between the witnesses and the validation disqualifies it.</p>
<p class="bas indent1"><span class="nm">(m)</span><span class="cl">Question:</span> Presumably, we are concerned lest he cut off the top (the document and witnesses) and write a document and forge signatures in the blank line (and it will have a validation of Beis Din below it)!</p>
<p class="bas indent2"><span class="nm">1.</span>R. Yochanan must say that a one-line document that includes the signatures is valid.</p>
<p class="bas indent2"><span class="nm">2.</span><span class="cl">Summation of question:</span> Also when there is one blank line between the text and the witnesses, perhaps he will cut off the top, and write a document in the blank line (and it will have signatures underneath)!</p>
<p class="bas indent1"><span class="nm">(n)</span><span class="cl">Answer:</span> R. Yochanan must say that a one-line document in which the signatures are <i>underneath</i> is invalid (we do not act according to the bottom line).</p>
<p class="bas indent1"><span class="nm">(o)</span><span class="cl">Question:</span> Perhaps when he writes the document in the blank line (above the witnesses), he will also forge signatures in that line; he will say that he wanted to have extra witnesses, therefore there are also signatures underneath!</p>
<p class="bas indent1"><span class="nm">(p)</span><span class="cl">Answer:</span> In such a case, it must be validated from the witnesses in the same line as the document.</p>
