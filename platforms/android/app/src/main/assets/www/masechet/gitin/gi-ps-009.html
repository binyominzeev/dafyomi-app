<p class="bas subject"><span class="nm">1)</span>SPLITTING ONE'S WORDS (cont.)</p>
<p class="bas indent1"><span class="nm">(a)</span><span class="cl">Question #1 (Rav Ada bar Masnah):</span> You hold like R. Shimon, who says that we split a person's words!</p>
<p class="bas indent2"><span class="nm">1.</span><span class="cl">(Mishnah):</span> If a man wrote a document giving all his property to his slave, the slave goes free;</p>
<p class="bas indent2"><span class="nm">2.</span>If the owner kept any property for himself, the slave does not go free;</p>
<p class="bas indent2"><span class="nm">3.</span>R. Shimon says, in every case he goes free, unless it says 'all my property is given to my slave, except for one part in 10,000.'</p>
<p class="bas indent2"><span class="nm">4.</span><span class="cl">(Culmination of question):</span> Rav Nachman said that even though R. Yosi praised R. Shimon, the Halachah follows R. Meir (Chachamim)!</p>
<p class="bas indent3"><span class="nm">i.</span><span class="cl">(Beraisa):</span> When R. Yosi heard R. Shimon's words, he said "lips should kiss one who answers correctly."</p>
<p class="bas indent1"><span class="nm">(b)</span><span class="cl">Question #2:</span> Rav Nachman said that if a Shechiv Mera (one who fears lest he die from his illness) wrote a document giving all his possessions to his slave, and later retracted, he can retract giving the property, but not the freedom. (He contradicts his above ruling like R. Meir, who does not split one's words!)</p>
<p class="bas indent2"><span class="nm">1.</span>He can retract giving the property, for this is the law of Matanas (the gift of a) Shechiv me'Ra;</p>
<p class="bas indent2"><span class="nm">2.</span>He cannot retract the freedom, for the slave was already called a free man.</p>
<p class="bas indent1"><span class="nm">(c)</span><span class="cl">Answer (to both questions - Rav Ashi):</span> Even R. Meir (the Chachamim of R. Shimon) holds that we split one's words. He disqualified the Get of freedom for a different reason;</p>
<p class="bas indent2"><span class="nm">1.</span>He holds that if the master retains something in a Get of freedom, it is Pasul. (We learn about freedom from divorce, which requires Sefer Kerisus, totally cutting off.)</p>
<p class="bas subject"><span class="nm">2)</span>A <i>GET</i> GIVEN WITHOUT A DECLARATION</p>
<p class="bas indent1"><span class="nm">(a)</span><span class="cl">(Mishnah):</span> If the Get is contested, it will be Mekuyam through its signatures.</p>
<p class="bas indent1"><span class="nm">(b)</span><span class="cl">Question:</span> How many people contest the Get?</p>
<p class="bas indent2"><span class="nm">1.</span><span class="cl">Suggestion:</span> One person contests it.</p>
<p class="bas indent2"><span class="nm">2.</span><span class="cl">Rejection:</span> R. Yochanan taught that one person who contests a Get is ignored!</p>
<p class="bas indent1"><span class="nm">(c)</span><span class="cl">Answer #1:</span> Rather, two contest it.</p>
<p class="bas indent1"><span class="nm">(d)</span><span class="cl">Objection:</span> Why does Kiyum help? Why should we believe the two witnesses who signed more than the two contesting it?</p>
<p class="bas indent1"><span class="nm">(e)</span><span class="cl">Answer #2:</span> Rather, the husband contests the Get.</p>
<p class="bas indent1"><span class="nm">(f)</span><span class="cl">(Mishnah):</span> If one brought a Get from abroad and cannot say 'it was written and signed in front of me', if the Get has signatures, we are Mekayem it through the signatures;</p>
<p class="bas indent2"><span class="nm">1.</span>This is one of three ways in which Gitei Nashim (of divorce) and of freedom have the same law.</p>
<p class="bas indent1"><span class="nm">(g)</span><span class="cl">(Gemara) Question:</span> Why can't he say the declaration?</p>
<p class="bas indent2"><span class="nm">1.</span><span class="cl">Suggestion:</span> He is a deaf-mute.</p>
<p class="bas indent2"><span class="nm">2.</span><span class="cl">Rejection:</span> A deaf-mute cannot bring a Get!</p>
<p class="bas indent3"><span class="nm">i.</span><span class="cl">(Mishnah):</span> Anyone can bring a Get, except for a deaf-mute, lunatic or minor.</p>
<p class="bas indent1"><span class="nm">(h)</span><span class="cl">Answer (Rav Yosef):</span> The case is, the Shali'ach gave the Get when he was healthy, and became deaf before he was able to say the declaration.</p>
<p class="bas subject"><span class="nm">3)</span>SIMILARITIES OF <i>GITEI</i> <i>NASHIM</i> AND OF FREEDOM</p>
<p class="bas indent1"><span class="nm">(a)</span><span class="cl">(Mishnah):</span> The law of Gitei Nashim and of freedom is the same.</p>
<p class="bas indent1"><span class="nm">(b)</span><span class="cl">(Beraisa):</span> Gitei Nashim and of freedom are the same regarding three Halachos:</p>
<p class="bas indent2"><span class="nm">1.</span>One who brings a Get to or from Chutz La'aretz (must say 'it was written...');</p>
<p class="bas indent2"><span class="nm">2.</span>Any Get on which a Kusi signed is Pasul, except for Gitei Nashim and of freedom. (After Sancheriv exiled the 10 tribes, he settled Nochrim in their place. The Kusim converted to avoid being eaten by lions, but did not accept the Oral Torah);</p>
<p class="bas bbbline">9b----------------------------------------9b</p>
<p class="bas indent2"><span class="nm">3.</span>All documents written by courts of Nochrim, even though they are signed by Nochrim, are valid, except for Gitei Nashim and of freedom.</p>
<p class="bas indent1"><span class="nm">(c)</span>R. Meir says, they are the same also regarding a fourth Halachah. One who says 'give this Get to my wife or slave' can retract.</p>
<p class="bas indent1"><span class="nm">(d)</span><span class="cl">Question:</span> Granted, Chachamim said three to exclude R. Meir's case;</p>
<p class="bas indent2"><span class="nm">1.</span>Why did R. Meir say four? What does he come to exclude?</p>
<p class="bas indent1"><span class="nm">(e)</span><span class="cl">Answer (Beraisa):</span> If witnesses do not know how to sign, we scratch outlines of the letters of their names in the parchment, and they fill them in with ink;</p>
<p class="bas indent2"><span class="nm">1.</span>R. Shimon ben Gamliel says, this applies only to Gitei Nashim. For Gitin of freedom, or all other documents, witnesses may only sign if they can read and sign.</p>
<p class="bas indent1"><span class="nm">(f)</span><span class="cl">Question:</span> The first Tana did not discuss whether or not they can read!</p>
<p class="bas indent1"><span class="nm">(g)</span><span class="cl">Answer:</span> The Beraisa is abbreviated. It means as follows:</p>
<p class="bas indent2"><span class="nm">1.</span>If witnesses do not know how to read, we read the document to them, and they sign;</p>
<p class="bas indent2"><span class="nm">2.</span>If witnesses do not know how to sign, we scratch outlines...</p>
<p class="bas indent1"><span class="nm">(h)</span><span class="cl">Question:</span> There are more similarities of Gitei Nashim and of freedom!</p>
<p class="bas indent1"><span class="nm">(i)</span><span class="cl">Question #1 (Mishnah):</span> If Levi said 'give this Get to my wife, and this Get to my slave', and Levi died, we do not give them posthumously. If he said 'give 100 Zuz to Ploni', we give it posthumously.</p>
<p class="bas indent1"><span class="nm">(j)</span><span class="cl">Answer:</span> We list only similarities that do not apply to other documents;</p>
<p class="bas indent2"><span class="nm">1.</span><span class="cl">(Ravin):</span> If a Shechiv Mera said 'write and give 100 Zuz to Ploni', we do not give it posthumously. Perhaps he wanted to give the gift only through a document, and a document cannot be given posthumously.</p>
<p class="bas indent1"><span class="nm">(k)</span><span class="cl">Question #2:</span> Gitei Nashim and of freedom are similar regarding Lishmah!</p>
<p class="bas indent2"><span class="nm">1.</span>This is not difficult for Rabah. We said that they are the same regarding saying 'it was written and signed in front of me', which is because they must be written Lishmah!</p>
<p class="bas indent2"><span class="nm">2.</span>This is difficult for Rava.</p>
<p class="bas indent1"><span class="nm">(l)</span><span class="cl">Question #3:</span> Both according to Rabah and Rava, why did the Beraisa omit saying that neither can be written while attached to the ground?</p>
<p class="bas indent1"><span class="nm">(m)</span><span class="cl">Answer (to Questions 2 and 3):</span> The Beraisa counts only Gitin Pasul mid'Rabanan, not those Pasul mid'Oraisa.</p>
<p class="bas indent1"><span class="nm">(n)</span><span class="cl">Objection:</span> A Get signed in the courts of Nochrim is Pasul mid'Oraisa, and this was counted!</p>
<p class="bas indent1"><span class="nm">(o)</span><span class="cl">Answer:</span> The case is, Yisrael witnesses saw it handed over. This is like R. Elazar, who says that Edei Mesirah Karsei (a Get is empowered by the witnesses that saw it given. Therefore, the Get is Kosher mid'Oraisa.)</p>
<p class="bas indent1"><span class="nm">(p)</span><span class="cl">Question:</span> (Surely, the Stam Tana of our Mishnayos (9a, 10a and 10b) is like the first Tana of the Beraisa, for he teaches only these three similarities);</p>
<p class="bas indent2"><span class="nm">1.</span><span class="cl">(Mishnah (10b) - R. Shimon):</span> Even these (Gitei Nashim and of freedom written by courts of Nochrim, even though they are signed by Nochrim) are Kosher;</p>
<p class="bas indent2"><span class="nm">2.</span><span class="cl">(R. Zeira):</span> R. Shimon holds like R. Elazar, that Edei Mesirah Karsei.</p>
<p class="bas indent2"><span class="nm">3.</span><span class="cl">Inference:</span> The Stam (first) Tana does not hold like R. Elazar!</p>
