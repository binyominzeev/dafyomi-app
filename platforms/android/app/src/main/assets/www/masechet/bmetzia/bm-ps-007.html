<p class="bas subject"><span class="nm">1)</span>THE DOUBTFUL CASES</p>
<p class="bas indent1"><span class="nm">(a)</span><span class="cl">Question (Rav Acha mi'Difti):</span> What are the Sefeikos (in the above Beraisa)?</p>
<p class="bas indent2"><span class="nm">1.</span>They are Safek Bechoros.</p>
<p class="bas indent2"><span class="nm">2.</span><span class="cl">Rejection:</span> "(The tenth) <i>will</i> be Kodesh." If it is already Kodesh, it cannot become Ma'aser!</p>
<p class="bas indent1"><span class="nm">(b)</span><span class="cl">Answer:</span> Rather, they are animals designated to redeem Safek Bechor donkeys.</p>
<p class="bas indent2"><span class="nm">1.</span><span class="cl">(Rav Nachman):</span> If a Yisrael has 10 Safek Bechor donkeys, he sets aside 10 sheep or goats and tithes them. They all belong to him.</p>
<p class="bas subject"><span class="nm">2)</span>CAN ONE BE <i>MAKDISH</i> PROPERTY NOT IN HIS <i>RESHUS</i>?</p>
<p class="bas indent1"><span class="nm">(a)</span><span class="cl">Question:</span> What was the conclusion about the bathhouse?</p>
<p class="bas indent1"><span class="nm">(b)</span><span class="cl">Answer (R. Chiya bar Avin):</span> If one was Makdish property that he cannot obtain through Beis Din, it is not Hekdesh.</p>
<p class="bas indent1"><span class="nm">(c)</span><span class="cl">Inference:</span> If he can obtain it through Beis Din, he can be Makdish it, even before receiving it.</p>
<p class="bas indent1"><span class="nm">(d)</span><span class="cl">Question:</span> R. Yochanan taught that if property was stolen and the owner did not despair, neither the owner nor the thief can make it Hekdesh;</p>
<p class="bas indent2"><span class="nm">1.</span>The thief cannot, because it is not his. The owner cannot, because it is not in his Reshus (even though he can obtain it through Beis Din)!</p>
<p class="bas indent1"><span class="nm">(e)</span><span class="cl">Answer:</span> The bathhouse is not movable. Rather, it is land. If one can obtain land through Beis Din, it is as if it is in his Reshus.</p>
<p class="bas subject"><span class="nm">3)</span>HOW WE SPLIT THE GARMENT</p>
<p class="bas indent1"><span class="nm">(a)</span><span class="cl">(Rav Tachlifa bar Ma'arava - Beraisa):</span> If two are holding a garment, each gets up to where he is holding, and they divide the rest evenly.</p>
<p class="bas indent1"><span class="nm">(b)</span>R. Avahu gestured to him that they must swear (Tosfos - to receive at all; Rambam - to divide the rest).</p>
<p class="bas indent1"><span class="nm">(c)</span><span class="cl">Question:</span> The Mishnah says that they divide (equally). It does not say that each gets up to where he is holding (and they divide the rest). What is the case?</p>
<p class="bas indent1"><span class="nm">(d)</span><span class="cl">Answer (Rav Papa):</span> Each is holding it by the fringes.</p>
<p class="bas indent1"><span class="nm">(e)</span><span class="cl">Inference (Rav Mesharshiya):</span> If one grabs three fingers by three fingers of a garment (given for Kinyan Chalipin), this fulfills "he gave to his fellowman" (he acquires), for we consider the garment to be cut (and he owns what he is holding).</p>
<p class="bas indent1"><span class="nm">(f)</span><span class="cl">Question:</span> Why is this different than Rav Chisda's law?</p>
<p class="bas indent2"><span class="nm">1.</span><span class="cl">(Rav Chisda):</span> If a man gave a Get to his wife, but he is holding a string attached to it, she is divorced only if he is unable to pull it out of her hands.</p>
<p class="bas indent1"><span class="nm">(g)</span><span class="cl">Answer:</span> Divorce requires "Kerisus (separation)." If he can retrieve it, he is still clinging;</p>
<p class="bas indent2"><span class="nm">1.</span>Chalipin requires giving. This was done.</p>
<p class="bas indent1"><span class="nm">(h)</span><span class="cl">(Rava):</span> If they hold a golden garment, we divide it.</p>
<p class="bas indent1"><span class="nm">(i)</span><span class="cl">Question:</span> This is obvious!</p>
<p class="bas indent1"><span class="nm">(j)</span><span class="cl">Answer:</span> The case is, the gold is in the middle.</p>
<p class="bas indent1"><span class="nm">(k)</span><span class="cl">Question:</span> Still, this is obvious!</p>
<p class="bas indent1"><span class="nm">(l)</span><span class="cl">Answer:</span> The case is, it is closer to one than to the other.</p>
<p class="bas indent2"><span class="nm">1.</span>One might have thought that we cut the garment widthwise (i.e. along the middle between where they are holding);</p>
<p class="bas indent2"><span class="nm">2.</span>Rava teaches that this is not so. The one further from the gold can suggest we cut it lengthwise. (The Gemara at the top of Daf 8a suggests another answer to this question.)</p>
<p class="bas subject"><span class="nm">4)</span>TWO HOLDING A DOCUMENT</p>
<p class="bas indent1"><span class="nm">(a)</span><span class="cl">(Beraisa #1 - Rebbi):</span> If a lender and borrower are holding the loan document, and each claims 'I dropped it', we validate the document;</p>
<p class="bas indent1"><span class="nm">(b)</span>R. Shimon ben Gamliel says, they divide it.</p>
<p class="bas indent1"><span class="nm">(c)</span>If it came to the judge, he never gives it back;</p>
<p class="bas indent1"><span class="nm">(d)</span>R. Yosi says, it remains in its Chazakah.</p>
<p class="bas indent1"><span class="nm">(e)</span>Rebbi said 'we validate the document.' This implies that the lender collects the full value.</p>
<p class="bas indent1"><span class="nm">(f)</span><span class="cl">Question:</span> Does Rebbi argue with our Mishnah (which says that they divide it)?</p>
<p class="bas indent1"><span class="nm">(g)</span><span class="cl">Answer (Rava):</span> If the document was validated, all agree that they divide it;</p>
<p class="bas indent2"><span class="nm">1.</span>They argue about a document that was not validated. Rebbi says that if a borrower admits that a document was written for a loan (but claims that he paid it), the lender must validate the document;</p>
<p class="bas indent3"><span class="nm">i.</span>(Since they both hold it), after it is validated, he collects half;</p>
<p class="bas indent3"><span class="nm">ii.</span><span class="cl">Question:</span> Why must he validate it?</p>
<p class="bas indent3"><span class="nm">iii.</span><span class="cl">Answer:</span> An invalidated document is worthless. If our only source to accredit it is the borrower, he says that it was paid!</p>
<p class="bas indent2"><span class="nm">2.</span>R. Shimon ben Gamliel holds that if the borrower admits that the document was written properly, the lender need not validate it. (Since both hold it, he collects half.)</p>
<p class="bas indent1"><span class="nm">(h)</span><span class="cl">Question:</span> The Beraisa says that if it came to the judge, he never gives it back. Why is it different in this case?</p>
<p class="bas bbbline">7b----------------------------------------7b</p>
<p class="bas indent1"><span class="nm">(i)</span><span class="cl">Answer (Rava):</span> The Beraisa means that if one finds a document that came to a judge, he never gives it back.</p>
<p class="bas indent1"><span class="nm">(j)</span><span class="cl">Question:</span> What is the case (in which he knows that it came to a judge)?</p>
<p class="bas indent1"><span class="nm">(k)</span><span class="cl">Answer:</span> It has been validated;</p>
<p class="bas indent2"><span class="nm">1.</span>The Beraisa teaches that 'he never gives it back.' This is not only when it is not validated, for perhaps it was never given;</p>
<p class="bas indent2"><span class="nm">2.</span>Rather, even if it was validated (surely it was given), he does not return it, lest the loan was paid.</p>
<p class="bas indent1"><span class="nm">(l)</span><span class="cl">(Beraisa - R. Yosi):</span> It remains in its Chazakah.</p>
<p class="bas indent2"><span class="nm">1.</span>He is not concerned lest it was paid.</p>
<p class="bas indent1"><span class="nm">(m)</span><span class="cl">Question:</span> R. Yosi is concerned lest a document was paid!</p>
<p class="bas indent2"><span class="nm">1.</span><span class="cl">(Beraisa #2):</span> If a Kesuvah was found in the market, if the husband admits (that his wife lost it), we return it to her;</p>
<p class="bas indent3"><span class="nm">i.</span>If he does not admit, we do not return it to either of them;</p>
<p class="bas indent2"><span class="nm">2.</span>R. Yosi says, if she is still married, we return it to her. If she was widowed or divorced, we do not return to either of them.</p>
<p class="bas indent1"><span class="nm">(n)</span><span class="cl">Answer #1A:</span> The opinions in Beraisa #1 must be switched. R. Yosi says 'he never gives it back', and Chachamim say 'it remains in its Chazakah.'</p>
<p class="bas indent1"><span class="nm">(o)</span><span class="cl">Question:</span> If so, Chachamim contradict themselves!</p>
<p class="bas indent1"><span class="nm">(p)</span><span class="cl">Answer:</span> R. Yosi taught all of Beraisa #2. It is abbreviated, and means as follows: ...if he does not admit, we do not return it to either. This is when she was widowed or divorced;</p>
<p class="bas indent2"><span class="nm">1.</span>If she is still married, we return it to her, for R. Yosi says that if she is still married, we return it to her, but if she was widowed or divorced, we do not return it to either.</p>
<p class="bas indent1"><span class="nm">(q)</span><span class="cl">Answer #2 (Rav Papa):</span> We need not switch the opinions. In Beraisa #2, R. Yosi addresses Chachamim's opinion:</p>
<p class="bas indent2"><span class="nm">1.</span>I say that even if she was widowed or divorced, we do not suspect that he paid it. You are concerned for this, but you should admit to me that if she is still married that we return it to her, for the husband would not pay her during the marriage!</p>
<p class="bas indent2"><span class="nm">2.</span>Chachamim are concerned lest he gave her money to hold, so that when she is entitled to her Kesuvah, she will not have problems collecting it.</p>
<p class="bas indent1"><span class="nm">(r)</span><span class="cl">Answer #1B (Ravina):</span> Really, we switch the opinions in Beraisa #1. In Beraisa #2, Chachamim are concerned lest two Kesuvos were written. R. Yosi is not concerned for this.</p>
<p class="bas subject"><span class="nm">5)</span>HOW WE SPLIT THE DOCUMENT</p>
<p class="bas indent1"><span class="nm">(a)</span><span class="cl">(R. Elazar):</span> In Beraisa #1, R. Shimon ben Gamliel said that they divide equally. This is only when both are holding the Toref (the vital information particular to this document) or both are holding the Tofes (the standard text that is the same for all loan documents);</p>
<p class="bas indent2"><span class="nm">1.</span>If one holds the Toref and the other holds the Tofes; each gets what he is holding.</p>
<p class="bas indent1"><span class="nm">(b)</span><span class="cl">(R. Yochanan):</span> They always divide equally, even if one holds the Tofes and one the Toref.</p>
<p class="bas indent1"><span class="nm">(c)</span><span class="cl">Question (Beraisa):</span> Each gets what he is holding.</p>
<p class="bas indent1"><span class="nm">(d)</span><span class="cl">Answer:</span> The case is, the Toref is in the middle.</p>
<p class="bas indent1"><span class="nm">(e)</span><span class="cl">Question:</span> If so, obviously gets half. How else could we divide it?</p>
<p class="bas indent1"><span class="nm">(f)</span><span class="cl">Answer:</span> The case is, the Toref is closer to one than the other. One might have thought that we divide the document widthwise (i.e. the one closer to the Toref gets the Toref);</p>
<p class="bas indent2"><span class="nm">1.</span>The Beraisa teaches that this is not so. The one further away can suggest we divide it lengthwise.</p>
<p class="bas indent1"><span class="nm">(g)</span><span class="cl">Question (Rav Acha mi'Difti):</span> R. Elazar says that one gets the Toref and the other gets the Tofes. What are they good for (by themselves)? Will he use it to cork a bottle?!</p>
<p class="bas indent1"><span class="nm">(h)</span><span class="cl">Answer (Ravina):</span> (A document with a date is worth more than one without a date, since it can be used to collect from land that the borrower sold after he borrowed.) The one holding the Toref (which includes the date) gets this difference. The rest they split equally (since the other vital information particular to the document appears also in the Tofes).</p>
<p class="bas indent1"><span class="nm">(i)</span><span class="cl">Support:</span> Also when it says that two holding a garment divide it, this means the value. If they would cut the garment, this would ruin it!</p>
<p class="bas indent1"><span class="nm">(j)</span><span class="cl">Rejection:</span> No, the halves would be fit for children.</p>
