<p class="dedicationbox">KESUVOS 55 - Two weeks of study material have been dedicated by Mrs. Estanne Abraham Fawer to honor the Yahrzeit of her father, Rav Mordechai ben Eliezer Zvi (Rabbi Morton Weiner) Z'L, who passed away on 18 Teves 5760. May the merit of supporting and advancing Dafyomi study -- which was so important to him -- during the weeks of his Yahrzeit serve as an Iluy for his Neshamah. </p>

<p class="bas subject"><span class="nm">1)</span>STIPULATIONS OF THE <i>KESUVAH</i> ARE LIKE THE <i>KESUVAH</i></p>
<p class="bas indent1"><span class="nm">(a)</span>(Tosefes and other) stipulations of the Kesuvah are like the Kesuvah also regarding:</p>
<p class="bas indent2"><span class="nm">1.</span>Collecting from improvements made to his land after he died;</p>
<p class="bas indent2"><span class="nm">2.</span>An oath (to collect them);</p>
<p class="bas indent2"><span class="nm">3.</span>Collecting them after Shemitah;</p>
<p class="bas indent2"><span class="nm">4.</span>A man who wrote all his property to his sons (and something to his wife. We say that she pardoned her lien on his property);</p>
<p class="bas indent2"><span class="nm">5.</span>Collecting (only) from land;</p>
<p class="bas indent2"><span class="nm">6.</span>Collecting from lowest quality land;</p>
<p class="bas indent2"><span class="nm">7.</span>A widow living in her father's house (if she did not mention the Kesuvah in 25 years, she pardoned it);</p>
<p class="bas indent2"><span class="nm">8.</span>Kesuvas Benin Dichrin. (Each woman's sons receive her Kesuvah, including the Tosefes.)</p>
<p class="bas subject"><span class="nm">2)</span>DISPUTES BETWEEN PUMBEDISA AND MASA MACHSIYA</p>
<p class="bas indent1"><span class="nm">(a)</span><span class="cl">(Chachamim of Pumbedisa):</span> Kesuvas Benin Dichrin is not collected from land that was sold. The Mishnah says 'they will inherit.' (Heirs do not collect land that their father sold.)</p>
<p class="bas indent1"><span class="nm">(b)</span><span class="cl">(Chachamim of Masa Machsiya):</span> It is collected from land that was sold. The Mishnah says 'they are owed.' (A creditor collects from sold land.)</p>
<p class="bas indent1"><span class="nm">(c)</span>The Halachah is, it is not collected.</p>
<p class="bas indent1"><span class="nm">(d)</span>If Metaltelim were designated to pay the Kesuvah and they are around, she collects them without an oath;</p>
<p class="bas indent1"><span class="nm">(e)</span><span class="cl">(Chachamim of Pumbedisa):</span> Even if they are not around, she collects without an oath;</p>
<p class="bas indent1"><span class="nm">(f)</span><span class="cl">(Chachamim of Masa Machsiya):</span> She must swear.</p>
<p class="bas indent1"><span class="nm">(g)</span>The Halachah is, she does not swear.</p>
<p class="bas indent1"><span class="nm">(h)</span>If land designated to pay the Kesuvah was delimited in all four directions, she collects it without an oath;</p>
<p class="bas indent1"><span class="nm">(i)</span><span class="cl">(Chachamim of Pumbedisa):</span> Even if only one border was specified, she collects without an oath;</p>
<p class="bas indent1"><span class="nm">(j)</span><span class="cl">(Chachamim of Masa Machsiya):</span> She must swear.</p>
<p class="bas indent1"><span class="nm">(k)</span>The Halachah is, she does not swear.</p>
<p class="bas indent1"><span class="nm">(l)</span>If Reuven told witnesses 'write, sign and give a deed (of land) to Ploni', if they acquired (through Chalipin, transferal of a garment) on behalf of Ploni, they fulfill the command without consulting with Reuven again.</p>
<p class="bas indent1"><span class="nm">(m)</span><span class="cl">(Chachamim of Pumbedisa):</span> (Even) if they did not acquire for Ploni, they need not consult again;</p>
<p class="bas indent1"><span class="nm">(n)</span><span class="cl">(Chachamim of Masa Machsiya):</span> They must consult.</p>
<p class="bas indent1"><span class="nm">(o)</span>The Halachah is, they must consult.</p>
<p class="bas subject"><span class="nm">3)</span>DO WE FOLLOW ASSESSMENT?</p>
<p class="bas indent1"><span class="nm">(a)</span><span class="cl">(Mishnah - R. Elazar ben Azaryah):</span> (If she was widowed or divorced from Eirusin, she does not receive Tosefes, for this was on condition that they have Nisu'in.)</p>
<p class="bas indent1"><span class="nm">(b)</span>Rav and R. Nasan argue about whether or not the Halachah follows R. Elazar ben Azaryah.</p>
<p class="bas indent1"><span class="nm">(c)</span><span class="cl">Suggestion:</span> R. Nasan is the one who says that the Halachah follows R. Elazar ben Azaryah, since he follows estimation.</p>
<p class="bas indent2"><span class="nm">1.</span><span class="cl">(R. Nasan):</span> The Halachah follows R. Shimon Shezuri regarding the following:</p>
<p class="bas indent3"><span class="nm">i.</span>One who is about to die. (If he commanded to write a Get for his wife, but neglected to say to give it, we assume that he wanted to give it.)</p>
<p class="bas bbbline">55b----------------------------------------55b</p>
<p class="bas indent3"><span class="nm">ii.</span>Terumas Ma'aser of Demai. (If one separated Terumas Ma'aser from doubtfully tithed produce and it became mixed with Chulin, we believe the seller to say that the produce was tithed.)</p>
<p class="bas indent1"><span class="nm">(d)</span><span class="cl">Question:</span> Also Rav follows estimation!</p>
<p class="bas indent2"><span class="nm">1.</span><span class="cl">(Rav):</span> If a Shechiv Mera (a sick person who fears lest he die) wrote a gift document that says that an acquisition was made, this gives the recipient both advantages:</p>
<p class="bas indent3"><span class="nm">i.</span>It is like the gift of a healthy person, in which the giver cannot retract;</p>
<p class="bas indent3"><span class="nm">ii.</span>It is like the gift of a Shechiv Mera, in which the giver can transfer a loan owed to him.</p>
<p class="bas indent2"><span class="nm">2.</span><span class="cl">(Shmuel):</span> I do not know how to judge this.</p>
<p class="bas indent3"><span class="nm">i.</span>Perhaps he intended that the gift should take effect only through the document (and Chalipin), which cannot work after he dies.</p>
