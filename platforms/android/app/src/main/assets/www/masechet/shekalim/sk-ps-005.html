<div class="subject"><span class="nm">1)</span><p>BROTHERS AND PARTNERS GIVING MA'ASER (cont'd)</p></div>
<div class="indent1"><span class="nm">(a)</span><p><span class="cl">(R. Yirmiyah):</span> There are two additional possibilities over those listed in the Mishnah.</p></div>
<div class="indent2"><span class="nm">1.</span><p>They are Chayavim to bring both Ma'aser <i>and</i> Kalbon.</p></div>
<div class="indent2"><span class="nm">2.</span><p>They are Peturim from both.</p></div>
<div class="indent1"><span class="nm">(b)</span><p><span class="cl">Example for #1:</span> They divided their property but not the animals.</p></div>
<div class="indent1"><span class="nm">(c)</span><p><span class="cl">Example for #2:</span> They divided the animals but not their property.</p></div>
<div class="indent1"><span class="nm">(d)</span><p><span class="cl">(R. Mana):</span> If the animals were the majority of the inheritance, then they dominate (Ikar).</p></div>
<div class="indent1"><span class="nm">(e)</span><p><span class="cl">Question (R. Shimi):</span> By obligating them in Ma'aser Beheimah you are going to exempt them from Kalbon (even though they are bringing the Selah from separated funds)?!</p></div>
<div class="indent1"><span class="nm">(f)</span><p><span class="cl">Answer:</span> Here it is different because they are bringing one Selah (as if it were undivided).</p></div>
<div class="indent1"><span class="nm">(g)</span><p><span class="cl">Question:</span> Then even if they re-join after having divided, they should be exempt from Kalbon (if they use one 'undivided' Selah) and yet we know that they are <i>obligated</i> in such a case?!</p></div>
<div class="indent1"><span class="nm">(h)</span><p><span class="cl">Answer:</span> They would be obligated in Kalbon as would be two brothers-in-law inheriting their father-in-law.</p></div>
<div class="subject"><span class="nm">2)</span><p>HOW WERE THE KALBANOS USED?</p></div>
<div class="indent1"><span class="nm">(a)</span><p><span class="cl">Question:</span> What was done with the Kalbonos?</p></div>
<div class="indent1"><span class="nm">(b)</span><p><span class="cl">Answer (R. Meir):</span> Towards the Shekalim.</p></div>
<div class="indent1"><span class="nm">(c)</span><p><span class="cl">Answer (R. Elazar):</span> Nedavos (for Olos).</p></div>
<div class="indent1"><span class="nm">(d)</span><p><span class="cl">Answer (R. Shimon Shezuri):</span> Gold plating and adornments for the Kodesh ha'Kodoshim.</p></div>
<div class="indent1"><span class="nm">(e)</span><p><span class="cl">Answer (Ben Azai):</span> The money changers would receive them as their fee.</p></div>
<div class="indent1"><span class="nm">(f)</span><p><span class="cl">Answer (Yesh Omrim):</span> Transport expenses.</p></div>
<div class="perekline">PEREK #2  METZARFIN SHEKALIM</div>
<div class="subject"><span class="nm">3)</span><p>LAWS ASSOCIATED WITH THE TRANSFER OF SHEKALIM TO YERUSHALAYIM</p></div>
<div class="indent1"><span class="nm">(a)</span><p>We may exchange the Shekalim for Darchonos to ease the transport.</p></div>
<div class="indent1"><span class="nm">(b)</span><p>All collections were made into narrow-mouthed collection boxes.</p></div>
<div class="indent1"><span class="nm">(c)</span><p>In the event of loss or theft of the money en route:</p></div>
<div class="indent2"><span class="nm">1.</span><p>If these funds were already advanced by the Gizbarim, then the transfer agents take a Shevuah to the Gizbarim.</p></div>
<div class="indent2"><span class="nm">2.</span><p>If funds were not yet taken from the Lishkah, then the agents take a Shevuah to those whose funds they were carrying and the latter must replace the funds.</p></div>
<div class="indent1"><span class="nm">(d)</span><p>If the funds were recovered they are considered Shekalim and may not be used for the following year.</p></div>
<div class="subject"><span class="nm">4)</span><p>CLARIFICATIONS IN THE MISHNAH</p></div>
<div class="indent1"><span class="nm">(a)</span><p><span class="cl">Question:</span> Change the coins into gems, making the transfer even easier?!</p></div>
<div class="indent1"><span class="nm">(b)</span><p><span class="cl">Answer:</span> Their value might go down, causing loss to Hekdesh (as is taught in the Beraisa).</p></div>
<div class="indent1"><span class="nm">(c)</span><p>The reference to narrow-mouthed "Shofaros" is to two such boxes in the Beis ha'Mikdash, one for new Shekalim and one for old.</p></div>
<div class="indent1"><span class="nm">(d)</span><p>There was only one such box in the outlying areas.</p></div>
<div class="indent1"><span class="nm">(e)</span><p>The Mishnah in dealing with loss and its consequences is speaking of a Shomer Chinam, not a Shomer Sachar (who would have to pay).</p></div>
<div class="indent1"><span class="nm">(f)</span><p><span class="cl">(R. Aba):</span> It could be speaking even by a Shomer Sachar in a case of Ones.</p></div>
<div class="indent1"><span class="nm">(g)</span><p>The issue of to whom they take the Shevuah assumes the position that the Gizbarim lay out the money for the funds not yet added to the Lishkah (otherwise the Shevuah would always be to those whose funds they were carrying).</p></div>
<div class="subject"><span class="nm">5)</span><p>INSURING ONE'S SHEKALIM</p></div>
<div class="indent1"><span class="nm">(a)</span><p><span class="cl">(R. Elazar):</span> Our Mishnah follows the opinion of R. Shimon that a person must insure that his gift arrives at Hekdesh.</p></div>
<div class="indent1"><span class="nm">(b)</span><p><span class="cl">(R. Yochanan):</span> In this case all would agree to the Shevuah as a Takanah in order that people not take the Hekdesh lightly.</p></div>
<div class="bbbline">5b----------------------------------------5b</p></div>
<div class="indent1"><span class="nm">(c)</span><p><span class="cl">Question:</span> According to R. Elazar, why would he take a Shevuah to the Gizbarim (it is only the insurers who must pay)?!</p></div>
<div class="indent1"><span class="nm">(d)</span><p><span class="cl">(Answer:</span> It means they take a Shevuah to the B'nei ha'Ir in the presence of the Gizbarim [to avoid suspicion].)</p></div>
<div class="indent1"><span class="nm">(e)</span><p>Even if the B'nei ha'Ir volunteer to pay (without imposing a Shevuah on their representatives), we still demand a Shevuah when Hekdesh is involved.</p></div>
<div class="indent1"><span class="nm">(f)</span><p><span class="cl">(R. Yochanan):</span> One who set aside his Shekel and it got lost, must replace it (until it is given to the Gizbar).</p></div>
<div class="indent1"><span class="nm">(g)</span><p><span class="cl">(Reish Lakish):</span> Hekdesh is always considered as already given.</p></div>
<div class="indent1"><span class="nm">(h)</span><p><span class="cl">Question:</span> Our Mishnah seems to contradict Reish Lakish (as the B'nei ha'Ir must replace the Shekalim)?</p></div>
<div class="indent1"><span class="nm">(i)</span><p><span class="cl">Answer:</span> As above, this is a Takanah.</p></div>
<div class="subject"><span class="nm">6)</span><p>WHICH COINS ARE OLD AND WHICH ARE NEW?</p></div>
<div class="indent1"><span class="nm">(a)</span><p>The first set of coins go into the box for new Shekalim while the second set of coins goes into the box for old Shekalim.</p></div>
<div class="indent1"><span class="nm">(b)</span><p><span class="cl">Question:</span> Which set is called old and which is called new?</p></div>
<div class="indent1"><span class="nm">(c)</span><p><span class="cl">Answer:</span> It is a dispute.</p></div>
<div class="subject"><span class="nm">7)</span><p>MISHNAH: ME'ILAH REGARDING THE SHEKALIM</p></div>
<div class="indent1"><span class="nm">(a)</span><p>If an agent used the Shekel as his own he is guilty of misappropriating Hekdesh (Me'ilah) if the Lishkah has already been drawn upon.</p></div>
<div class="indent1"><span class="nm">(b)</span><p>If a person accidentally tried to give his Shekel from coins which were already Hekdesh, again, he is guilty if the Lishkah has been drawn upon, <i>and</i> the Korban bought with those funds has been offered.</p></div>
<div class="indent1"><span class="nm">(c)</span><p>If he took the Shekel from money with Kedushas Shevi'is or Ma'aser Sheni, he must designate substitute funds.</p></div>
<div class="indent1"><span class="nm">(d)</span><p>We have a Beraisa which learns the qualification of the "Korban has been offered" also in the Reisha (point (a) above).</p></div>
<div class="indent1"><span class="nm">(e)</span><p>The position that Me'ilah would occur once the Lishkah has been drawn upon is R. Shimon (in the Mishnah from the 4th Perek which teaches that the money from the Lishkah becomes Chulin as soon as it is drawn upon, and not only once the Korban is offered).</p></div>
<div class="indent1"><span class="nm">(f)</span><p><span class="cl">Question:</span> The Shekel should serve the purpose of the original owner!?</p></div>
<div class="indent1"><span class="nm">(g)</span><p><span class="cl">Answer:</span> The original owner had his agent in mind (as in the case of the family of R. Gamliel).</p></div>
<div class="indent1"><span class="nm">(h)</span><p><span class="cl">Question:</span> But the money might end up as part of Shirayim?!</p></div>
<div class="indent1"><span class="nm">(i)</span><p><span class="cl">Answer #1:</span> R. Meir holds that there is Me'ilah by Shirayim.</p></div>
<div class="indent1"><span class="nm">(j)</span><p><span class="cl">Answer #2:</span> This coin was designated both for its agent as well as its use - for Korbanos (not Shirayim).</p></div>
<div class="indent1"><span class="nm">(k)</span><p><span class="cl">Question:</span> What benefit did he get (such that there should be Me'ilah)?</p></div>
<div class="indent1"><span class="nm">(l)</span><p><span class="cl">Answer:</span> He avoids the impounding of a security.</p></div>
<div class="subject"><span class="nm">8)</span><p>ONE WHO GIVES HIS SHEKEL FROM MA'ASER OR SHEVI'IS</p></div>
<div class="indent1"><span class="nm">(a)</span><p><span class="cl">Question:</span> What is the source for this Din?</p></div>
<div class="indent1"><span class="nm">(b)</span><p><span class="cl">Answer:</span> The Pasuk teaches that a new Kedushah cannot come upon an existing one (and to allow the original coins to become Shekalim it is necessary to be Mechalel their Kedushah onto a new coin).</p></div>
