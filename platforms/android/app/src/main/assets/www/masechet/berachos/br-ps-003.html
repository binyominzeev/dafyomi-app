<p class="bas subject"><span class="nm">1)</span>MISHMAROS</p>
<p class="bas indent1"><span class="nm">(a)</span><span class="cl">(Mishnah - R. Eliezer):</span> ... Until the end of the first Mishmar.</p>
<p class="bas indent1"><span class="nm">(b)</span><span class="cl">Question:</span> What is R. Eliezer's opinion about Mishmaros?</p>
<p class="bas indent2"><span class="nm">1.</span>If he holds that there are three Mishmaros in the night (each being four hours long), then he should say "until four hours"!</p>
<p class="bas indent2"><span class="nm">2.</span>If he holds that there are four Mishmaros, then he should say "until three hours"!</p>
<p class="bas indent1"><span class="nm">(c)</span><span class="cl">Answer:</span> He holds that there are three Mishmaros. He says "until the end of the first Mishmar" in order to teach that there are Mishmaros in Shamayim and on earth.</p>
<p class="bas indent2"><span class="nm">1.</span><span class="cl">(Beraisa - R. Eliezer):</span> There are three Mishmaros. At each Mishmar, Hash-m roars like a lion [over the Churban].</p>
<p class="bas indent2"><span class="nm">2.</span><span class="cl">There is a sign for each Mishmar:</span> a donkey brays in the first, dogs bark in the second, babies nurse and wives talk with their husbands in the third.</p>
<p class="bas indent1"><span class="nm">(d)</span><span class="cl">Question:</span> At which part of the Mishmaros are the signs?</p>
<p class="bas indent2"><span class="nm">1.</span>It cannot be the beginning -- no sign would be needed for the first Mishmar, because it starts at the arrival of night!</p>
<p class="bas indent2"><span class="nm">2.</span>It cannot be the end -- no sign would be needed for the last Mishmar, because it ends at the arrival of day!</p>
<p class="bas indent1"><span class="nm">(e)</span><span class="cl">Answer #1:</span> The signs are for the end of the first Mishmar, the middle of the second, and the beginning of the last Mishmar.</p>
<p class="bas indent1"><span class="nm">(f)</span><span class="cl">Answer #2:</span> The signs are for the ends of each Mishmar;</p>
<p class="bas indent2"><span class="nm">1.</span>Even though most people do not need a sign for the last Mishmar, it is useful for someone sleeping in a dark house (who will not see the light of dawn) to know that it is almost time for the morning Shema.</p>
<p class="bas indent1"><span class="nm">(g)</span><span class="cl">(R. Yitzchak bar Shmuel):</span> There are three Mishmaros. In each Mishmar, Hash-m roars like a lion, "Woe unto My children, for due to their sins I destroyed My house, burned My sanctuary, and exiled them among the nations of the world!"</p>
<p class="bas subject"><span class="nm">2)</span>ENTERING A RUIN</p>
<p class="bas indent1"><span class="nm">(a)</span><span class="cl">(Beraisa - R. Yosi):</span> Once, when I was traveling, I entered one of the ruins of Yerushalayim to pray. Eliyahu waited for me at the door. Afterwards, he told me that I should have prayed on the road.</p>
<p class="bas indent2"><span class="nm">1.</span><span class="cl">R. Yosi:</span> I was afraid that passersby would interrupt me!</p>
<p class="bas indent2"><span class="nm">2.</span><span class="cl">Eliyahu:</span> You should have said an abridged prayer.</p>
<p class="bas indent1"><span class="nm">(b)</span><span class="cl">(R. Yosi):</span> I learned three things from this: one should not enter a ruin, one may pray on the road, and one who prays on the road may say an abridged prayer.</p>
<p class="bas indent2"><span class="nm">1.</span><span class="cl">Eliyahu:</span> What did you hear inside?</p>
<p class="bas indent2"><span class="nm">2.</span><span class="cl">R. Yosi:</span> I heard a voice like a dove, saying, "Woe unto My children, for due to their sins I destroyed My house, burned My sanctuary, and exiled them among the nations of the world!"</p>
<p class="bas indent2"><span class="nm">3.</span><span class="cl">Eliyahu:</span> A voice says that three times every day:</p>
<p class="bas indent3"><span class="nm">i.</span>When the Jewish people enter synagogues and study halls and proclaim, "Yehei Shmei ha'Gadol Mevorach," Hash-m nods His head and says, "How fortunate is the King Whom they praise in His house like that! Woe to the Father Who exiled His children, and woe to the children who have been exiled from their Father's table!" (Maharsha- after the Churban, Hash-m's throne is not complete; He refers to Himself as "father," not as "King.")</p>
<p class="bas indent1"><span class="nm">(c)</span><span class="cl">(Beraisa):</span> There are three reasons why one should not enter a ruin: it may cause suspicion, the ruin might collapse, and because of Mazikin (damaging spirits).</p>
<p class="bas indent1"><span class="nm">(d)</span><span class="cl">Question:</span> Why must the Beraisa say on account of suspicion? It would suffice to say it might collapse!</p>
<p class="bas bbbline">3b----------------------------------------3b</p>
<p class="bas indent1"><span class="nm">(e)</span><span class="cl">Answer:</span> This teaches that one should not enter even a new ruin (in which there is no concern of collapse).</p>
<p class="bas indent2"><span class="nm">1.</span><span class="cl">Question:</span> We would know that one should not enter a new ruin on account of Mazikin!</p>
<p class="bas indent2"><span class="nm">2.</span><span class="cl">Answer:</span> It teaches that even two people should not enter (there is no concern for Mazikin with two people).</p>
<p class="bas indent2"><span class="nm">3.</span><span class="cl">Question:</span> If two people enter, there is no suspicion!</p>
<p class="bas indent2"><span class="nm">4.</span><span class="cl">Answer:</span> If two immoral people enter, there is suspicion.</p>
<p class="bas indent1"><span class="nm">(f)</span><span class="cl">Question:</span> Why must the Beraisa say that it might collapse? It would suffice to say on account of suspicion!</p>
<p class="bas indent1"><span class="nm">(g)</span><span class="cl">Answer:</span> This teaches that one should not enter even a new ruin (in which there is no concern of collapse).</p>
<p class="bas indent1"><span class="nm">(h)</span><span class="cl">Question:</span> We would know that one should not enter a new ruin on account of Mazikin!</p>
<p class="bas indent1"><span class="nm">(i)</span><span class="cl">Answer:</span> It teaches that even two people should not enter (there is no concern for Mazikin with two people).</p>
<p class="bas indent1"><span class="nm">(j)</span><span class="cl">Question:</span> If two people enter, there is no suspicion!</p>
<p class="bas indent1"><span class="nm">(k)</span><span class="cl">Answer:</span> If two immoral people enter, there is suspicion.</p>
<p class="bas indent1"><span class="nm">(l)</span><span class="cl">Question:</span> Why must the Beraisa say it might collapse? It would suffice to say on account of suspicion and Mazikin!</p>
<p class="bas indent1"><span class="nm">(m)</span><span class="cl">Answer:</span> This teaches that even two decent people should not enter.</p>
<p class="bas indent1"><span class="nm">(n)</span><span class="cl">Question:</span> Why must it say on account of Mazikin? It would suffice to say on account of suspicion and collapse!</p>
<p class="bas indent1"><span class="nm">(o)</span><span class="cl">Answer #1:</span> This teaches that even two proper people should not enter a new ruin.</p>
<p class="bas indent2"><span class="nm">1.</span><span class="cl">Question:</span> There is no concern for Mazikin when there are two people!</p>
<p class="bas indent2"><span class="nm">2.</span><span class="cl">Answer:</span> In a place where Mazikin are common, we are concerned.</p>
<p class="bas indent1"><span class="nm">(p)</span><span class="cl">Answer #2:</span> This teaches that one person should not enter a new ruin in the wilderness; there is no concern for suspicion, for women are not found there, but Mazikin are.</p>
<p class="bas subject"><span class="nm">3)</span>MISHMAROS</p>
<p class="bas indent1"><span class="nm">(a)</span><span class="cl">(Beraisa - Rebbi):</span> There are four Mishmaros in the night;</p>
<p class="bas indent1"><span class="nm">(b)</span>R. Nasan says there are three.</p>
<p class="bas indent1"><span class="nm">(c)</span>R. Nasan learns from "va'Yavo Gid'on... Rosh ha'Ashmores ha'Tichonah";</p>
<p class="bas indent2"><span class="nm">1.</span><span class="cl">(Beraisa):</span> "Middle" connotes that there is one before it and one after it.</p>
<p class="bas indent1"><span class="nm">(d)</span>Rebbi must explain it is one of the [two] middle Mishmaros.</p>
<p class="bas indent1"><span class="nm">(e)</span>R. Nasan does not accept this -- it does not say, "one of the middle Mishmaros"!</p>
<p class="bas indent1"><span class="nm">(f)</span><span class="cl">Question:</span> What is Rebbi's reason?</p>
<p class="bas indent1"><span class="nm">(g)</span><span class="cl">Answer (R. Zerika):</span> It says, "Chatzos Lailah Akum l'Hodos Lach," and "Kidmu Einai Ashmuros" (David would rise at midnight to sing to Hash-m; this was "Ashmuros" (plural) before morning);</p>
<p class="bas indent2"><span class="nm">1.</span>Since there are two Mishmaros in half the night, there are four in all.</p>
<p class="bas indent1"><span class="nm">(h)</span>R. Nasan holds like R. Yehoshua:</p>
<p class="bas indent2"><span class="nm">1.</span><span class="cl">(Mishnah - R. Yehoshua):</span> The morning Shema may be said until three hours of the day, for it is normal for kings to rise then;</p>
<p class="bas indent2"><span class="nm">2.</span>[There are three Mishmaros, each is four hours.] David says that he rises eight hours (six of the night and two of the day) before other kings, i.e. two Mishmaros.</p>
<p class="bas indent1"><span class="nm">(i)</span><span class="cl">(Rav Ashi):</span> [R. Nasan need not hold like R. Yehoshua. David says that he rises six hours before morning;] the plural "Ashmuros" is also used for one and a half Mishmaros.</p>
<p class="bas indent1"><span class="nm">(j)</span><span class="cl">(R. Zerika):</span> In front of a Mes we say only things pertaining to the Mes.</p>
<p class="bas indent1"><span class="nm">(k)</span><span class="cl">Version #1 (R. Aba bar Kahana):</span> This refers only to words of Torah, other things need not pertain to the Mes.</p>
<p class="bas indent1"><span class="nm">(l)</span><span class="cl">Version #2 (R. Aba bar Kahana):</span> This refers even to words of Torah, all the more so other things must pertain to the Mes.</p>
<p class="bas subject"><span class="nm">4)</span>DAVID WOULD RISE AT MIDNIGHT</p>
<p class="bas indent1"><span class="nm">(a)</span><span class="cl">Contradiction:</span> One verse (quoted above) says that David would rise at midnight, but another verse says, "Kidamti va'Neshef va'Ashave'ah" (he rose at the beginning of the night)!</p>
<p class="bas indent2"><span class="nm">1.</span><span class="cl">Question:</span> How do we know that "Neshef" refers to night?</p>
<p class="bas indent2"><span class="nm">2.</span><span class="cl">Answer:</span> It says, "b'Neshef b'Erev Yom b'Ishun Lailah va'Afeilah."</p>
<p class="bas indent1"><span class="nm">(b)</span><span class="cl">Answer (R. Oshaya):</span> In the previous verse, David says that he was never sleeping when midnight arrived.</p>
<p class="bas indent1"><span class="nm">(c)</span><span class="cl">(R. Zeira):</span> Until midnight, David would doze like a horse (never falling into a deep sleep; he would constantly arouse himself and engage in Torah); from midnight onwards, he would invigorate himself like a lion (and engage in Torah without dozing).</p>
<p class="bas indent1"><span class="nm">(d)</span><span class="cl">(Rav Ashi):</span> Until midnight, David would engage in Torah; from midnight onwards, he would sing praises to Hash-m.</p>
<p class="bas indent1"><span class="nm">(e)</span><span class="cl">Contradiction:</span> We said that "Neshef" is night, but another verse says that it is morning: "va'Yakem David meha'Neshef v'Ad ha'Erev l'Macharasam."</p>
<p class="bas indent2"><span class="nm">1.</span><span class="cl">Suggestion:</span> This means from morning until evening!</p>
<p class="bas indent1"><span class="nm">(f)</span><span class="cl">Answer #1:</span> No, it means from evening until evening.</p>
<p class="bas indent1"><span class="nm">(g)</span><span class="cl">Rejection:</span> If so, it should say, "meha'Neshef v'Ad ha'Neshef," or "meha'Erev v'Ad ha'Erev"!</p>
<p class="bas indent1"><span class="nm">(h)</span><span class="cl">Answer #2 (Rava):</span> Neshef can refer to the transition between night and day, or to the transition between day and night.</p>
<p class="bas indent1"><span class="nm">(i)</span><span class="cl">Question:</span> How could David know [exactly] when midnight is -- even Moshe did not know!</p>
<p class="bas indent2"><span class="nm">1.</span><span class="cl">Question:</span> "<i>ka'Chatzos</i> ha'Lailah Ani Yotzei b'Soch Mitzrayim" -- what does this mean?</p>
<p class="bas indent3"><span class="nm">i.</span>Surely, Hash-m did not say this to Moshe; He has no doubt!</p>
<p class="bas indent2"><span class="nm">2.</span><span class="cl">Answer:</span> Rather, Hash-m told Moshe "ba'Chatzos"; since Moshe did not know exactly when midnight is, he would not be able to predict the exact time, and therefore he said "ka'Chatzos."</p>
<p class="bas indent1"><span class="nm">(j)</span><span class="cl">Answer:</span> David had a sign to know when midnight is:</p>
<p class="bas indent2"><span class="nm">1.</span><span class="cl">(Rav Acha bar Bizna):</span> There was a harp above his bed. At midnight the north wind would blow and cause the harp to play; David would rise and engage in Torah until dawn.</p>
<p class="bas indent1"><span class="nm">(k)</span>At dawn, the Chachamim came; they said that the nation cannot support themselves financially. David told them to go to war.</p>
<p class="bas indent1"><span class="nm">(l)</span>(Ya'aros Devash, cited by Anaf Yosef, based on a Midrash: When David killed Golyas (Goliath), the Jewish women showered him with tremendous wealth. The Chachamim wanted David to use that money to feed the hungry, but David was keeping it to build the Beis ha'Mikdash.)</p>
<p class="bas indent1"><span class="nm">(m)</span>They took counsel from Achitofel, consulted the Sanhedrin, and asked the Urim v'Tumim -- "v'Acharei Achitofel Yehoyada ben Benayahu v'Evyasar v'Sar Tzava la'Melech Yo'av."</p>
<p class="bas indent1"><span class="nm">(n)</span>Yehoyada ben Benayahu was the Av Beis Din of the Sanhedrin -- "u'Venayah ben Yehoyada Al ha'Kreisi v'al ha'Pleisi" (Tosfos- we assume that his son succeeded him as Av Beis Din).</p>
