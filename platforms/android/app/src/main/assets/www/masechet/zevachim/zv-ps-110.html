<div class="subject"><span class="nm">1)</span><p><i>HAKTARAH</i> OF <i>CHASER</i></p></div>
<div class="indent1"><span class="nm">(a)</span><p><span class="cl">Answer #4 (Rava):</span> The case is, the full Shi'ur was put in a Kli Shares;</p></div>
<div class="indent2"><span class="nm">1.</span><p>R. Elazar holds that this is Kove'a (fixes; anything less than this is not Haktarah). Chachamim hold that it is not Kove'a (a k'Zayis is still considered Haktarah).</p></div>
<div class="indent1"><span class="nm">(b)</span><p><span class="cl">(Rava):</span> According to Chachamim, who hold that a Kli Shares is not Kove'a, if six Lugim of wine were put in a Kli (for the Nisuch of a Par) and four of them were offered outside, he is liable, for this is the Nisuch for a ram;</p></div>
<div class="indent2"><span class="nm">1.</span><p>If four Lugim were put in a Kli (for a ram) and three were offered outside, he is liable, for this is the Nisuch for a lamb. (The words connote that if six were put in a Kli for Nisuch Par, and only three were offered outside, he is exempt. However, I did not see anyone say so. Chidushei Basra (Yesh Makshim 1192) says in the name of the Griz that in every case he is liable for three outside.)</p></div>
<div class="indent2"><span class="nm">2.</span><p>If less than three were offered outside, he is exempt.</p></div>
<div class="indent1"><span class="nm">(c)</span><p><span class="cl">Defense (of Answer #3 - Rav Ashi):</span> Chachamim do not learn Nisuch from Haktarah, even though both of them are Chutz;</p></div>
<div class="indent2"><span class="nm">1.</span><p>Chachamim do learn Haktarah from Haktarah, even Panim from Chutz.</p></div>
<div class="indent1"><span class="nm">(d)</span><p><span class="cl">(Mishnah):</span> If any of them became Chaser (before Haktarah, he is exempt for Ha'alas Chutz).</p></div>
<div class="indent1"><span class="nm">(e)</span><p><span class="cl">Question:</span> If the full Shi'ur was taken outside and became Chaser there, what is the law?</p></div>
<div class="indent2"><span class="nm">1.</span><p>Since taking it outside disqualified (yet one is liable), an additional Pesul of Chaser does not change anything;</p></div>
<div class="indent2"><span class="nm">2.</span><p>Or, perhaps Ha'alas Chutz applies only when the full Shi'ur is intact?</p></div>
<div class="indent1"><span class="nm">(f)</span><p><span class="cl">Answer #1 (Abaye - Mishnah - R. Eliezer):</span> He is exempt, unless he offered all of it.</p></div>
<div class="indent2"><span class="nm">1.</span><p><span class="cl">Objection (Rabah bar Rav Chanan):</span> (R. Eliezer surely exempts. The question is according to Chachamim.) How can you learn from R. Elazar to Chachamim?!</p></div>
<div class="indent2"><span class="nm">2.</span><p><span class="cl">Answer (Abaye):</span> Rabah explicitly said that Chachamim argue only when the Kodesh is intact. If it is Chaser, also they exempt.</p></div>
<div class="indent3"><span class="nm">i.</span><p><span class="cl">Suggestion:</span> This is true even if it became Chaser outside.</p></div>
<div class="indent2"><span class="nm">3.</span><p><span class="cl">Rejection:</span> No, it is only if it became Chaser inside.</p></div>
<div class="indent1"><span class="nm">(g)</span><p><span class="cl">Answer #2 (Mishnah):</span> If it became Chaser and the rest was offered outside, he is exempt.</p></div>
<div class="indent2"><span class="nm">1.</span><p><span class="cl">Suggestion:</span> This is even if it became Chaser outside.</p></div>
<div class="indent1"><span class="nm">(h)</span><p><span class="cl">Rejection:</span> No, it is only if it became Chaser inside.</p></div>
<div class="indent1"><span class="nm">(i)</span><p><span class="cl">(Mishnah):</span> If one offered Kodshim with the Eimurim attached, he is liable.</p></div>
<div class="indent1"><span class="nm">(j)</span><p><span class="cl">Question:</span> Why is he liable? The meat is a Chatzizah (between the Eimurim and the Ma'arachah!)</p></div>
<div class="indent1"><span class="nm">(k)</span><p><span class="cl">Answer #1 (Shmuel):</span> The case is, he turned the meat over (so that the Eimurim touch the wood).</p></div>
<div class="indent1"><span class="nm">(l)</span><p><span class="cl">Answer #2 (R. Yochanan):</span> Our Mishnah is like R. Shimon, who obligates for Ha'alas Chutz even on a rock. (He does not learn from Avodas ha'Mikdash that a Mizbe'ach is required. Likewise, he does not learn that the Kodesh must touch the wood.)</p></div>
<div class="indent1"><span class="nm">(m)</span><p><span class="cl">Answer #3 (Rav):</span> Min b'Mino (the Eimurim are also meat) is not a Chatzizah.</p></div>
<div class="subject"><span class="nm">2)</span><p>OFFERING A <i>KOMETZ</i></p></div>
<div class="indent1"><span class="nm">(a)</span><p><span class="cl">(Mishnah):</span> If a Minchah was offered outside and Kemitzah was never done, he is exempt (for it was not Kosher to offer inside);</p></div>
<div class="indent1"><span class="nm">(b)</span><p>If a Kometz was taken and it returned to the Shirayim and they were offered outside, he is liable.</p></div>
<div class="indent1"><span class="nm">(c)</span><p><span class="cl">(Gemara) Question:</span> Why is he liable? The Kometz should be Batel to the Shirayim. One is exempt for offering Shirayim (since they are not offered inside)!</p></div>
<div class="indent1"><span class="nm">(d)</span><p><span class="cl">Answer (R. Zeira):</span> It says "Haktarah" regarding the Kometz and regarding Shirayim. Just like Komtzim are not Mevatel Komtzim (we learn from the blood of the Par and Sa'ir that Olim are not Mevatel each other), also Shirayim are not Mevatel Komtzim.</p></div>
<div class="indent1"><span class="nm">(e)</span><p><span class="cl">(Mishnah):</span> If either the Kometz or Levonah of a Minchah was offered outside, he is liable;</p></div>
<div class="indent1"><span class="nm">(f)</span><p>R. Elazar exempts, unless he offers both;</p></div>
<div class="indent2"><span class="nm">1.</span><p>If he offered one of them inside and the other outside, he is liable.</p></div>
<div class="indent1"><span class="nm">(g)</span><p>If one of the two spoons of Levonah (of Lechem ha'Panim) was offered outside, he is liable;</p></div>
<div class="indent1"><span class="nm">(h)</span><p>R. Elazar exempts, unless he offers both.</p></div>
<div class="indent2"><span class="nm">1.</span><p>If he offered one inside and the other outside, he is liable.</p></div>
<div class="indent1"><span class="nm">(i)</span><p><span class="cl">(Gemara) Question (R. Yitzchak Nafcha):</span> Does offering a Kometz permit half of the Shirayim (since it is one of the two Matirim)?</p></div>
<div class="indent2"><span class="nm">1.</span><p>Does it permit half? (Rashi - does it permit eating half? Tosfos - even if it permits half, one may not eat half, for we do not know which half! However, if it permits half, the other half remains fully forbidden, so one who eats all the Shirayim is lashed for eating Kodshim before its Matirim);</p></div>
<div class="indent2"><span class="nm">2.</span><p>Or, does it weaken the Isur on all the Shirayim (and one is not lashed for eating them)?</p></div>
<div class="indent2"><span class="nm">3.</span><p><span class="cl">Question:</span> According to which opinion does R. Yitzchak ask?</p></div>
<div class="indent3"><span class="nm">i.</span><p>He does not ask according to R. Meir, who says that intent in one of the Matirim is Mefagel. Surely he holds that it permits half!</p></div>
<div class="indent3"><span class="nm">ii.</span><p>He does not ask according to Chachamim (who argue with R. Meir). They say that intent in one Matir is not Mefagel. Perhaps offering it neither permits nor weakens the Isur!</p></div>
<div class="indent2"><span class="nm">4.</span><p><span class="cl">Answer #1:</span> It is according to R. Elazar;</p></div>
<div class="indent2"><span class="nm">5.</span><p><span class="cl">Rejection:</span> He exempts for partial Haktarah. Surely he holds like the Chachamim of R. Meir (perhaps it neither permits nor weakens!)</p></div>
<div class="indent2"><span class="nm">6.</span><p><span class="cl">Answer #2:</span> It is according to Chachamim of R. Elazar. Does offering a Kometz permit half of the Shirayim, or weaken the Isur on all them?</p></div>
<div class="indent1"><span class="nm">(j)</span><p>This question is not resolved.</p></div>
<div class="subject"><span class="nm">3)</span><p>THE <i>ISUR</i> OF <i>NISUCH B'CHUTZ</i></p></div>
<div class="indent1"><span class="nm">(a)</span><p><span class="cl">(Mishnah):</span> If one threw some of the blood b'Chutz, he is liable;</p></div>
<div class="bbbline">110b----------------------------------------110b</p></div>
<div class="indent1"><span class="nm">(b)</span><p>R. Elazar says, even one who is Menasech (b'Chutz) Mei ha'Chag (Nisuch ha'Mayim) on Sukos is liable.</p></div>
<div class="indent1"><span class="nm">(c)</span><p>R. Nechemyah says, one who offers Shirayim of blood b'Chutz is liable.</p></div>
<div class="indent1"><span class="nm">(d)</span><p><span class="cl">(Gemara - Rava):</span> R. Elazar agrees about blood (that one is liable for partial Zerikah outside, for partial Zerikah inside in valid);</p></div>
<div class="indent2"><span class="nm">1.</span><p><span class="cl">(Mishnah - R. Elazar and R. Shimon):</span> (If the blood of an inner Chatas spilled in the middle of the Haza'os, those that were done are valid.) We slaughter another Chatas, and use its blood for the remaining Haza'os.</p></div>
<div class="indent1"><span class="nm">(e)</span><p><span class="cl">(Mishnah - R. Elazar):</span> Even one who is Menasech Mei ha'Chag on Sukos is liable.</p></div>
<div class="indent1"><span class="nm">(f)</span><p><span class="cl">(R. Yochanan citing R. Menachem Yudfa'ah):</span> R. Elazar holds like his Rebbi, R. Akiva, who says that Nisuch ha'Mayim is mid'Oraisa;</p></div>
<div class="indent2"><span class="nm">1.</span><p><span class="cl">(Beraisa - R. Akiva):</span> "U'Nsacheha" (plural) discusses two Nesachim, of water and wine. (Since water is offered in the Mikdash on Sukos, one is liable for it outside on Sukos.)</p></div>
<div class="indent1"><span class="nm">(g)</span><p><span class="cl">Questions (Reish Lakish):</span> If R. Elazar learns like R. Akiva, since the Torah teaches both Nesachim together, they should be the same!</p></div>
<div class="indent2"><span class="nm">1.</span><p>Nisuch of water should be three Lugim, just like Nisuch of wine. R. Elazar said (Stam) Nisuch ha'Mayim (he did not fix a Shi'ur; presumably, he obligates b'Chutz like for the Mitzvah,) and one opinion says that this is one Log!</p></div>
<div class="indent2"><span class="nm">2.</span><p>The Chiyuv for water b'Chutz should be every day of the year, just like that of wine (since Nisuch of wine applies every day). R. Elazar said (only) 'b'Chag'!</p></div>
<div class="indent1"><span class="nm">(h)</span><p><span class="cl">Answer:</span> He (Rashi - R. Menachem; Tosfos - Reish Lakish) did not know R. Asi''s teaching;</p></div>
<div class="indent2"><span class="nm">1.</span><p><span class="cl">(R. Asi):</span> The following are traditions from Moshe from Sinai:</p></div>
<div class="indent3"><span class="nm">i.</span><p>Ten saplings (even though mid'Oraisa, one must add to Shemitah and cease working the land before Shemitah, if 10 saplings are evenly spaced over a square of 50 Amos by 50 Amos, the entire field may be plowed in Erev Shemitah until Rosh Hashanah);</p></div>
<div class="indent3"><span class="nm">ii.</span><p>Taking an Aravah (in the Mikdash on Sukos, aside from the four species);</p></div>
<div class="indent3"><span class="nm">iii.</span><p>Nisuch ha'Mayim. (Tosfos - R. Menachem meant that R. Elazar holds like R. Akiva that Nisuch ha'Mayim is mid'Oraisa, but R. Elazar knows this from tradition (unlike R. Akiva who expounded it), therefore it need not resemble Nisuch of wine. Rashi - R. Menachem erred. R. Elazar relies on the tradition, therefore it need not resemble Nisuch of wine.)</p></div>
<div class="indent1"><span class="nm">(i)</span><p><span class="cl">(Beraisa):</span> One who is Menasech three Lugim of water outside on Sukos is liable;</p></div>
<div class="indent1"><span class="nm">(j)</span><p>R. Elazar says, if the Kli was filled with water for the sake of Nisuch ha'Mayim, he is liable. (Rashi - the Kli cannot Mekadesh more than the three Lugim needed for the Mitzvah; Chachamim (the first Tana) put no upper limit on the amount of water one is liable for. Tosfos - R. Elazar is Mechayev for Mei ha'Chag, he puts no limit on the amount; Chachamim are Mechayev precisely for three Lugim.)</p></div>
<div class="indent1"><span class="nm">(k)</span><p><span class="cl">Question:</span> What is the source of the argument?</p></div>
<div class="indent1"><span class="nm">(l)</span><p><span class="cl">Answer #1 (Rav Nachman bar Yitzchak):</span> They argue about whether there is a Shi'ur for Nisuch ha'Mayim.</p></div>
