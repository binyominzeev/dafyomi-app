<p class="bas subject"><span class="nm">1)</span>IS EXCESSIVE <i>SHEMIRAH</i> PERMITTED?</p>
<p class="bas indent1"><span class="nm">(a)</span><span class="cl">(Tana d'vei Menasheh - Beraisa):</span> If one carved a hole in the horn of a goat, it may go out with a halter on Shabbos [inserted through the hole - otherwise it is forbidden, for the goat slips its head out of it].</p>
<p class="bas indent1"><span class="nm">(b)</span><span class="cl">Question (Rav Yosef):</span> If one [tied its beard and] inserted the halter through a hole in the beard, what is the law?</p>
<p class="bas indent2"><span class="nm">1.</span>The goat would not pull itself away, for this would be painful (it is proper Shemirah, it is permitted);</p>
<p class="bas indent2"><span class="nm">2.</span>Or, we are concerned lest the beard get untied and the halter will fall off, and the owner will carry it four Amos in Reshus ha'Rabim, so it is forbidden!</p>
<p class="bas indent1"><span class="nm">(c)</span>This question is not resolved.</p>
<p class="bas indent1"><span class="nm">(d)</span><span class="cl">(Mishnah):</span> A cow may not go out with a strap between its horns.</p>
<p class="bas indent1"><span class="nm">(e)</span><span class="cl">(R. Yirmiyah bar Aba):</span> Rav and Shmuel argue about this - one forbids whether it is for Noy (decoration) or for Shemirah (to hold it by the strap - this is excessive, for one can lead a cow without holding it);</p>
<p class="bas indent2"><span class="nm">1.</span>The other forbids if it is for Noy, but permits if it is for Shemirah.</p>
<p class="bas indent1"><span class="nm">(f)</span><span class="cl">(Rav Yosef):</span> Surely, Shmuel permits for Shemirah, for Rav Huna said in Shmuel's name that the Halachah follows Chananyah (excessive Shemirah is not a load)!</p>
<p class="bas indent1"><span class="nm">(g)</span><span class="cl">Objection (Abaye):</span> Just the contrary, Shmuel forbids even for Shemirah!</p>
<p class="bas indent2"><span class="nm">1.</span><span class="cl">(Rav Yehudah citing Shmuel):</span> People asked Rebbi whether or not an animal may go out with Shemirah which is permitted for a different animal.</p>
<p class="bas indent2"><span class="nm">2.</span><span class="cl">R. Yishmael b'Rebbi Yosi:</span> My father taught that four animals go out with a halter - a horse, mule, camel and donkey.</p>
<p class="bas indent2"><span class="nm">3.</span><span class="cl">Inference:</span> A camel may go out with a halter, but not with a nose-ring!</p>
<p class="bas indent1"><span class="nm">(h)</span><span class="cl">Answer (Rav Yosef):</span> We reject that teaching (it must be mistaken) on account of Rav Huna's teaching.</p>
<p class="bas indent1"><span class="nm">(i)</span><span class="cl">Question:</span> Why do we reject Rav Yehudah's teaching and accept Rav Huna's - perhaps we should reject Rav Huna's and accept Rav Yehudah's!</p>
<p class="bas indent1"><span class="nm">(j)</span><span class="cl">Answer:</span> We do so on account of what other Amora'im said in the name of Rav and Shmuel:</p>
<p class="bas indent2"><span class="nm">1.</span><span class="cl">(R. Chiya bar Aba citing Rav):</span> It is forbidden whether it is for Noy or for Shemirah.</p>
<p class="bas indent2"><span class="nm">2.</span><span class="cl">(R. Chiya bar Avin citing Shmuel):</span> It is forbidden if it is for Noy, it is permitted if it is for Shemirah.</p>
<p class="bas indent1"><span class="nm">(k)</span><span class="cl">Question (Beraisa):</span> If Reuven had a Parah Adumah and tied a halter on it, it is Kosher;</p>
<p class="bas indent2"><span class="nm">1.</span>If it was considered a load, this would disqualify it - "Asher Lo Alah Aleha Ol!" (any Melachah disqualifies it)!</p>
<p class="bas indent1"><span class="nm">(l)</span><span class="cl">Answer #1 (Abaye):</span> The case is, Reuven was leading it from one city to another (in this case, a halter is needed for Shemirah).</p>
<p class="bas indent1"><span class="nm">(m)</span><span class="cl">Answer #2 (Rava):</span> Parah Adumah is different, for it is very valuable (its proper Shemirah is better than that of regular cows).</p>
<p class="bas indent1"><span class="nm">(n)</span><span class="cl">Answer #3 (Ravina):</span> The case is, it was rebellious.</p>
<p class="bas subject"><span class="nm">2)</span>TAKING AN ANIMAL OUT WITH A CHAIN</p>
<p class="bas indent1"><span class="nm">(a)</span><span class="cl">(Mishnah):</span> A horse may go out with a chain [and all Ba'alei Shir go out with a chain and are pulled by it].</p>
<p class="bas indent1"><span class="nm">(b)</span><span class="cl">Question:</span> What does it mean 'Go out with a chain and are pulled by it?</p>
<p class="bas indent1"><span class="nm">(c)</span><span class="cl">Answer #1 (Rav Huna):</span> The chain may be Karuch (wrapped around the neck), or used to pull the animal. (Tosfos - he holds that Karuch is also for Shemirah, it can be used to grab the animal; Rashi - Karuch is only for Noy.)</p>
<p class="bas indent1"><span class="nm">(d)</span><span class="cl">Answer #2 (Shmuel):</span> It may be Karuch only if the animal is pulled by it.</p>
<p class="bas indent1"><span class="nm">(e)</span><span class="cl">(Beraisa):</span> Animals may go out Keruchim to be pulled by it. (Tosfos - Rav Huna explains, they may go out Keruchim if they could be pulled by it, i.e. there is room to insert one's hand.)</p>
<p class="bas indent1"><span class="nm">(f)</span><span class="cl">(Rav Yosef):</span> I saw calves of Rav Huna's house go out Keruchim with halters.</p>
<p class="bas indent1"><span class="nm">(g)</span><span class="cl">(Rav Dimi):</span> The mules of Rebbi's house went out with halters on Shabbos.</p>
<p class="bas indent1"><span class="nm">(h)</span><span class="cl">Question:</span> Did they go out Keruchim, or pulled?</p>
<p class="bas indent1"><span class="nm">(i)</span><span class="cl">Answer (Rav Shmuel bar Yehudah):</span> His mules went out Keruchim with halters on Shabbos.</p>
<p class="bas indent1"><span class="nm">(j)</span><span class="cl">Question (Rabanan):</span> We already know this from Rav Dimi's teaching!</p>
<p class="bas indent2"><span class="nm">1.</span>Surely, Rav Dimi did not teach that they were pulled on halters - Rav Yehudah already taught that Rebbi permits this!</p>
<p class="bas indent2"><span class="nm">2.</span><span class="cl">(Rav Yehudah):</span> People asked Rebbi whether or not an animal may go out with Shemirah which is permitted for a different animal.</p>
<p class="bas indent2"><span class="nm">3.</span><span class="cl">R. Yishmael b'Rebbi Yosi:</span> My father taught that four animals go out with a halter - a horse, mule, camel and donkey.</p>
<p class="bas indent1"><span class="nm">(k)</span><span class="cl">Answer (Rav Asi):</span> [Perhaps Rav Dimi taught that they were pulled on halters,] nevertheless we could not have learned from Rav Yehudah;</p>
<p class="bas indent2"><span class="nm">1.</span>Rav Yehudah taught that Rebbi heard that R. Yosi permitted a mule to go out with a halter; he did not say whether or not Rebbi accepted this!</p>
<p class="bas indent2"><span class="nm">2.</span>Rav Dimi teaches that Rebbi accepted this, but he did not specify if he permits Keruchim only if they can be pulled by them (there is room to insert one's hand), or even if not;</p>
<p class="bas indent2"><span class="nm">3.</span>Therefore, Rav Shmuel's teaching is necessary.</p>
<p class="bas subject"><span class="nm">3)</span>TAKING AN ANIMAL OUT WITH A RING</p>
<p class="bas indent1"><span class="nm">(a)</span><span class="cl">(Mishnah):</span> One may sprinkle on it [a chain] and immerse it while it is in place.</p>
<p class="bas indent1"><span class="nm">(b)</span><span class="cl">Inference:</span> This implies that it is Mekabel Tum'ah.</p>
<p class="bas indent1"><span class="nm">(c)</span><span class="cl">Contradiction (Mishnah):</span> Rings of (worn by) people are Teme'im (Mekabel Tum'ah);</p>
<p class="bas indent2"><span class="nm">1.</span>Rings of animals (e.g. in a chain) or of vessels (e.g. handles) and all other rings are Tehorim.</p>
<p class="bas bbbline">52b----------------------------------------52b</p>
<p class="bas indent1"><span class="nm">(d)</span><span class="cl">Answer #1 (R. Yitzchak):</span> Our Mishnah discusses a person's ring that became Tamei, then was designated for an animal.</p>
<p class="bas indent1"><span class="nm">(e)</span><span class="cl">Answer #2 (Rav Yosef):</span> It is Tamei because people use it to pull the animal:</p>
<p class="bas indent2"><span class="nm">1.</span><span class="cl">(Beraisa):</span> A metal rod used for animals is Tamei.</p>
<p class="bas indent2"><span class="nm">2.</span>This is because the person hits the animal with it [to make it go, the rod serves man] - likewise, since a person uses the chain to pull the animal, it is Tamei.</p>
<p class="bas indent1"><span class="nm">(f)</span><span class="cl">(Mishnah):</span> One may immerse it while it is in place.</p>
<p class="bas indent1"><span class="nm">(g)</span><span class="cl">Question:</span> There is a Chatzitzah! (Rashi - the ring is snug in the chain; R. Pores - it is tight against the animal's neck.)</p>
<p class="bas indent1"><span class="nm">(h)</span><span class="cl">Answer #1 (R. Ami):</span> The case is, it was beaten, it is loose.</p>
<p class="bas indent2"><span class="nm">1.</span><span class="cl">Suggestion:</span> R. Ami holds like Rav Yosef - if he held like R. Yitzchak, since an action was done to it, the Tum'ah would have vanished!</p>
<p class="bas indent3"><span class="nm">i.</span><span class="cl">(Mishnah):</span> [If one is making a Kli,] intent (to use it like it is now) causes it to Mekabel Tum'ah, a physical change is needed to Metaher (intent to fix it for a different use does not suffice).</p>
<p class="bas indent2"><span class="nm">2.</span><span class="cl">Rejection:</span> He can hold even like R. Yitzchak - he holds like R. Yehudah, who says that a constructive change does not Metaher (beating it makes it useful for an animal).</p>
<p class="bas indent3"><span class="nm">i.</span><span class="cl">(Beraisa - R. Yehudah):</span> A physical change is Metaher only if it is destructive, not if it improves.</p>
<p class="bas indent1"><span class="nm">(i)</span><span class="cl">Answer #2 (Beraisa):</span> The hole was big from the beginning.</p>
<p class="bas indent1"><span class="nm">(j)</span><span class="cl">Question (a Talmid):</span> I heard that there is a difference between different kinds of rings!</p>
<p class="bas indent1"><span class="nm">(k)</span><span class="cl">Answer (R. Eliezer):</span> There is a difference regarding Shabbos, but all are the same regarding Tum'ah.</p>
<p class="bas indent1"><span class="nm">(l)</span><span class="cl">Question (Mishnah):</span> Rings of people are Tamei, rings of animals, of vessels and all other rings are Tehorim.</p>
<p class="bas indent1"><span class="nm">(m)</span><span class="cl">Answer:</span> R. Eliezer discusses only rings of people.</p>
<p class="bas indent1"><span class="nm">(n)</span><span class="cl">Question:</span> Not all rings of people are the same regarding Tum'ah!</p>
<p class="bas indent2"><span class="nm">1.</span><span class="cl">(Beraisa):</span> If a ring was fixed [for a buckle through which a strap passes] for girding oneself at the loins, or between the shoulders [to hold rolled up sleeves], it is Tahor;</p>
<p class="bas indent2"><span class="nm">2.</span>Only a ring worn on the finger is Tamei.</p>
<p class="bas indent1"><span class="nm">(o)</span><span class="cl">Answer:</span> R. Eliezer discusses only rings worn on the finger.</p>
<p class="bas indent1"><span class="nm">(p)</span><span class="cl">Question:</span> Not all rings worn on the finger are Teme'im!</p>
<p class="bas indent2"><span class="nm">1.</span><span class="cl">(Beraisa):</span> If a metal ring has a stamp of coral wood, it is Tamei; if the ring is coral and the stamp is metal, it is Tahor.</p>
<p class="bas indent1"><span class="nm">(q)</span><span class="cl">Answer:</span> R. Eliezer discusses metal rings.</p>
<p class="bas subject"><span class="nm">4)</span>DIFFERENT KINDS OF NEEDLES</p>
<p class="bas indent1"><span class="nm">(a)</span><span class="cl">Question (the Talmid):</span> I heard that there is a difference between different kinds of needles!</p>
<p class="bas indent1"><span class="nm">(b)</span><span class="cl">Answer (R. Eliezer):</span> There is a difference regarding Shabbos, but all are the same regarding Tum'ah.</p>
<p class="bas indent1"><span class="nm">(c)</span><span class="cl">Question (Mishnah):</span> If the hole or point of a needle is missing, it is Tahor.</p>
<p class="bas indent1"><span class="nm">(d)</span><span class="cl">Answer:</span> R. Eliezer discusses intact needles.</p>
<p class="bas indent1"><span class="nm">(e)</span><span class="cl">Question (Mishnah):</span> If a needle became rusty - if the rust prevents sewing, it is Tahor; if not, it is Tamei;</p>
<p class="bas indent2"><span class="nm">1.</span><span class="cl">(R. Yanai):</span> It is Tamei only if the end can be used for writing (alternatively - it is Tahor if the rust leaves a mark on the item sewn).</p>
<p class="bas indent1"><span class="nm">(f)</span><span class="cl">Answer:</span> R. Eliezer discusses needles that were filed down (they have no rust).</p>
<p class="bas indent1"><span class="nm">(g)</span><span class="cl">Question:</span> Even such needles are not always Tamei!</p>
<p class="bas indent2"><span class="nm">1.</span><span class="cl">(Beraisa):</span> A needle may be moved on Shabbos whether or not it has a hole - only Tum'ah depends on having a hole.</p>
<p class="bas indent1"><span class="nm">(h)</span><span class="cl">Answer (Abaye):</span> The Beraisa discusses unfinished needles.</p>
<p class="bas subject"><span class="nm">5)</span>WHICH SADDLES ARE PERMITTED FOR AN ANIMAL TO WEAR ON SHABBOS?</p>
<p class="bas indent1"><span class="nm">(a)</span><span class="cl">(Mishnah):</span> A donkey may go out with a Marda'as tied to it. (This is a pack saddle for loads. It gives warmth. Donkeys are always cold.)</p>
<p class="bas indent1"><span class="nm">(b)</span>Rams may go out Levuvim. Female sheep may go out Shechuzos, Kevulos and Kevunos (all of these will be defined);</p>
<p class="bas indent1"><span class="nm">(c)</span>Goats may go out [with their udders] wrapped;</p>
<p class="bas indent1"><span class="nm">(d)</span>R. Yosi forbids all of these, except for sheep Kevunos.</p>
<p class="bas indent1"><span class="nm">(e)</span>R. Yehudah permits goats to go wrapped to be dry (not to produce milk), but not for milk (wrapped loosely, so it will not inhibit milk, or in order to catch drops; alternatively - to prevent dripping).</p>
