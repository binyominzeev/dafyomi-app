<p class=newsubafdaf><span class=numt>1)</span> QUESTIONS OF ALEXANDER THE GREAT</p>
<p class=firstindent><span class=numl1>(a)</span>	Alexandrus Mokdon asked ten things of the Ziknei ha'Negev (the Elders of the South):</p>
<p class=firstindent><span class=numl1>(b)</span>	Question #1: Which is farther -- from the heavens to the earth, or (the width of the earth) from east to west (Maharsha - from the support given for Answer #1, it is evident that this means from the eastern extreme to (where we are, in) the middle of the world)?</p>
<p class=firstindent><span class=numl1>(c)</span><span class=desl1>	Answer #1 (Ziknei ha'Negev):</span> It is farther from east to west;</p>
<p class=secondindent><span class=numl2>1.</span><span class=desl2>	Support:</span> When the sun is in the east or west (sunrise and sunset), one can look at it, but when it is overhead, it is too strong to look at.</p>
<p class=firstindent><span class=numl1>(d)</span><span class=desl1>	Answer #2 ((other) Chachamim):</span> Both are the same -- "(Hashem's kindness is) chi'Gevoha Shamayim Al ha'Aretz... ; chi'Rechok Mizrach mi'Ma'arav";</p>
<p class=secondindent><span class=numl2>1.</span>	If one of these distances was greater, the verse would mention only the greater one!</p>
<p class=secondindent><span class=numl2>2.</span><span class=desl2>	Question:</span> Why is the sun too strong to look at when it is overhead?</p>
<p class=secondindent><span class=numl2>3.</span><span class=desl2>	Answer:</span> This is because it is uncovered. (When it is in the east or west, mountains intervene.)</p>
<p class=firstindent><span class=numl1>(e)</span>	Question #2: Which was created first -- the heavens or the land? (Maharsha; Mefaresh - or, were they created at the same time)?</p>
<p class=firstindent><span class=numl1>(f)</span><span class=desl1>	Answer (Chachamim):</span> Shamayim was created first -- "Bereishis Bara Elokim Es ha'Shamayim v'Es ha'Aretz."</p>
<p class=firstindent><span class=numl1>(g)</span>	Question #3: Which was created first, light or darkness?</p>
<p class=firstindent><span class=numl1>(h)</span>	Chachamim: There is no answer to that question.</p>
<p class=secondindent><span class=numl2>1.</span><span class=desl2>	Question:</span> They should have said that darkness was created first -- "veha'Aretz Haisah Sohu va'Vohu v'Choshech," and afterwards it says "va'Yomer Elokim Yehi Or va'Yehi Or"!</p>
<p class=secondindent><span class=numl2>2.</span><span class=desl2>	Answer:</span> Chachamim feared lest he ask what is above and below (the firmament, over the heads of the angels called Chayos), in front and in back (past the east and west limits of the firmament).</p>
<p class=secondindent><span class=numl2>3.</span><span class=desl2>	Question:</span> If so, they also should not have answered that Shamayim was created first!</p>
<p class=secondindent><span class=numl2>4.</span><span class=desl2>	Answer:</span> At first, they thought that he just happened to ask about it. When they saw that he persisted to ask about the beginning of Creation, they feared lest he ask about before that.</p>
<p class=firstindent><span class=numl1>(i)</span>	Question #4: Who is a Chacham?</p>
<p class=firstindent><span class=numl1>(j)</span><span class=desl1>	Answer (Chachamim):</span> A Chacham is one who foresees what will come (from his actions, and acts accordingly).</p>
<p class=firstindent><span class=numl1>(k)</span>	Question #5: Who is a Gibor (mighty)?</p>
<p class=firstindent><span class=numl1>(l)</span><span class=desl1>	Answer (Chachamim):</span> A Gibor is one who overcomes his Yetzer (ha'Ra).</p>
<p class=firstindent><span class=numl1>(m)</span>	Question #6: Who is an Ashir (rich)?</p>
<p class=firstindent><span class=numl1>(n)</span><span class=desl1>	Answer (Chachamim):</span> An Ashir is one who is happy with what he has.</p>
<p class=newsubject><span class=numt>2)</span> HOW TO LIVE</p>
<p class=firstindent><span class=numl1>(a)</span>	Question #7: What should one do in order to live?</p>
<p class=firstindent><span class=numl1>(b)</span><span class=desl1>	Answer (Chachamim):</span> He should kill himself. (Mefaresh - he should lower himself; Rosh - he should toil for food to live in this world, and deny himself pleasures and toil in Torah to live in the world to come).</p>
<p class=firstindent><span class=numl1>(c)</span>	Question #8: What should one do in order to die?</p>
<p class=firstindent><span class=numl1>(d)</span><span class=desl1>	Answer (Chachamim):</span> He should aggrandize himself. (This brings envy and Ayin Ra'ah upon himself.)</p>
<p class=firstindent><span class=numl1>(e)</span>	Question #9: How can one make oneself popular (so his words will be accepted)?</p>
<p class=firstindent><span class=numl1>(f)</span><span class=desl1>	Version #1 - Answer (Chachamim):</span> He should hate (avoid contact with) the king and authorities (lest people think that he informs).</p>
<p class=secondindent><span class=numl2>1.</span><span class=desl2>	Alexandrus:</span> I know more than you. He should love his king and authorities, and (persuade them to) do good to people (of his locale)!</p>
<p class=firstindent><span class=numl1>(g)</span><span class=desl1>	Version #2 - Answer (Chachamim):</span> He should hate (evade) kingship and authority (rather, he should be humble).</p>
<p class=secondindent><span class=numl2>1.</span><span class=desl2>	Alexandrus:</span> I know more than you. He should love kingship and authority. If he rises to power he can do good for people!</p>
<p class=firstindent><span class=numl1>(h)</span>	Question #10: Is it better to live at sea or on the dry land?</p>
<p class=firstindent><span class=numl1>(i)</span><span class=desl1>	Answer (Chachamim):</span> It is better to live on the dry land. Seafarers' minds are not clear until they come to land.</p>
<p class=firstindent><span class=numl1>(j)</span>	Alexandrus: Which of you are wisest?</p>
<p class=firstindent><span class=numl1>(k)</span>	Chachamim: All of us are equal. Everything you asked, all of us agreed about the answer.</p>
<p class=firstindent><span class=numl1>(l)</span>	Alexandrus: Why do you oppose me? (Rosh - you do not intermarry or eat and drink with us. Mefaresh - you do not accept our god. We outnumber you, you should fear us! Maharsha - Alexandrus wanted to be praised for his wisdom, might, and welath, but Chachamim answered that he is not the true Chacham, Gibor or Ashir.)</p>
<p class=firstindent><span class=numl1>(m)</span>	Chachamim: The Satan deceives. (You are above now, but in the end you will descend (R. Gershom - to Gehinom)).</p>
<p class=firstindent><span class=numl1>(n)</span>	Alexandrus: I could kill you through a royal edict (for answering me with contempt)!</p>
<p class=firstindent><span class=numl1>(o)</span>	Chachamim: Indeed, you could. However, it does not befit a king to falsify his words! (You promised not to harm us.)</p>
<p class=newsubject><span class=numt>3)</span> ALEXANDRUS' TRIP TO AFRICA</p>
<p class=firstindent><span class=numl1>(a)</span>	Alexandrus dressed them in purple and put gold chains on their necks, and told them that he plans to go to Africa.</p>
<p class=firstindent><span class=numl1>(b)</span>	Chachamim: You cannot. On the way there are Harei Choshech (mountains that totally darken the area even during the day).</p>
<p class=firstindent><span class=numl1>(c)</span>	Alexandrus: I am determined to go. Tell me how!</p>
<p class=firstindent><span class=numl1>(d)</span>	Chachamim: Take big donkeys of Egypt that can go in the dark, and balls of ropes; tie one end of the ropes where there is light, and take the other end through the dark so you will know how to return.</p>
<p class=firstindent><span class=numl1>(e)</span>	Alexandrus did so. He came to a city of (only) women, and planned to wage war against it.</p>
<p class=secondindent><span class=numl2>1.</span><span class=desl2>	The women:</span> If you kill us, people will say that you killed women. (That is no sign of strength.) If we kill you, people will say you were killed by women (a great disgrace)!</p>
<p class=secondindent><span class=numl2>2.</span>	(Alexandrus agreed.) He requested bread, and they gave to him gold bread on a gold table.</p>
<p class=bbbline>32b----------------------------------------32b</p>
<p class=secondindent><span class=numl2>3.</span><span class=desl2>	Alexandrus:</span> Who can eat gold bread?</p>
<p class=secondindent><span class=numl2>4.</span><span class=desl2>	The women:</span> (We assumed you wanted gold --) if you wanted bread, you did not need to come all the way here!</p>
<p class=firstindent><span class=numl1>(f)</span>	When Alexandrus left, he wrote on the gate of the city, "I, Alexandrus, was foolish until I came to an African city of women who counseled me."</p>
<p class=firstindent><span class=numl1>(g)</span>	When he was returning, he sat to eat bread by a stream. He had salted fish with him, and was rinsing off the salt in the stream. They absorbed a nice smell. (Rosh - they returned to life.) He concluded that the stream comes from Gan Eden.</p>
<p class=firstindent><span class=numl1>(h)</span>	Version #1: He (merely) washed his face in the water.</p>
<p class=firstindent><span class=numl1>(i)</span>	Version #2: He followed the stream to its source, the entrance to Gan Eden, and requested that it open for him.</p>
<p class=secondindent><span class=numl2>1.</span>	He was told "Zeh ha'Sha'ar la'Hashem Tzadikim Yavo'u Vo." (You are not worthy to enter.)</p>
<p class=secondindent><span class=numl2>2.</span><span class=desl2>	Alexandrus:</span> I am a king. I am important. (If you will not let me in,) give me something!</p>
<p class=secondindent><span class=numl2>3.</span>	They gave him a skull (Rosh - eyeball).  he put it on the scale against all his gold and silver, it outweighed them. He asked Chachamim to explain this.</p>
<p class=secondindent><span class=numl2>4.</span><span class=desl2>	Chachamim:</span> It is of flesh and blood. It is never sated. It always seeks to draw more towards itself (Similarly, your wealth did not satisfy you, so you had to go to Africa.)</p>
<p class=secondindent><span class=numl2>5.</span><span class=desl2>	Alexandrus:</span> How can I verify your answer?</p>
<p class=secondindent><span class=numl2>6.</span><span class=desl2>	Chachamim:</span> Cover it with earth (so it cannot see), and then you can find its weight.</p>
<p class=secondindent><span class=numl2>7.</span>	He did so, and succeeded -- "She'ol va'Avadu Lo Sisbanah v'Einei ha'Adam Lo Sisbanah" (just like the grave and Gehinom always want more to come there, also man always desires more (until he is buried in the earth)).</p>
<p class=firstindent><span class=numl1>(j)</span><span class=desl1>	(Tana d'Vei Eliyahu):</span> Gehinom is above the firmament;</p>
<p class=firstindent><span class=numl1>(k)</span>	Some say, it is in back of Harei Choshech (mountains that darken, like on Amud A)..</p>
<p class=firstindent><span class=numl1>(l)</span><span class=desl1>	(Tana d'Vei R. Chiya):</span> The Shechinah faces anyone who engages in Torah at night -- "Kumi Roni ba'Lailah... Nochach Pnei Hash-m."</p>
<p class=firstindent><span class=numl1>(m)</span><span class=desl1>	(R. Elazar):</span> Chachamim increase Shalom in the world -- "v'Chol Banayich Limudei Hash-m v'Rav Shelom Banayich." (We read this "Bonayich".)</p>
<p class=perekline>PEREK AMAR LAHEM HA'MEMUNAH</p>
<p class=newsubject><span class=numt>4)</span> CONTINUATION OF THE <i>AVODAH</i></p>
<p class=firstindent><span class=numl1>(a)</span><span class=desl1>	(Mishnah 1):</span> The appointee would tell them to say one Berachah (before Shma, Ahavah Rabah. It was too early to say Yotzer Or), and they said it;</p>
<p class=firstindent><span class=numl1>(b)</span>	They read Aseres ha'Dibros, Shma, v'Hayah Im Shamo'a, va'Yomer, and blessed (the people - some delete this from the text) three Berachos -- Emes v'Yatziv, (the Berachah of Retzei due to the) Avodah, and Birkas Kohanim;</p>
<p class=firstindent><span class=numl1>(c)</span>	On Shabbos, an extra Berachah was given to the departing Mishmar.</p>
<p class=firstindent><span class=numl1>(d)</span><span class=desl1>	(Mishnah 2):</span> He said. "those who have never offered Ketores before, come for the lottery for Ketores!" It was conducted. (He said) "everyone come for the lottery for who will take limbs from the ramp to the Mizbe'ach." (Rosh - one Kohen takes all the limbs.)</p>
<p class=firstindent><span class=numl1>(e)</span>	R. Eliezer ben Yakov says, the ones who brought the limbs half-way up the ramp put them on the Mizbe'ach.</p>
<p class=firstindent><span class=numl1>(f)</span><span class=desl1>	(Mishnah 3):</span> Overseers in the Mikdash took back the Bigdei Kehunah from Kohanim who were not selected in any lottery, except for the pants. There were compartments for the Begadim labeled "Tashmish ha'Kelim."</p>
<p class=firstindent><span class=numl1>(g)</span><span class=desl1>	(Mishnah 4):</span> The one selected to offer Ketores took the ladle. It was like a big golden basket holding three Kavim;</p>
<p class=secondindent><span class=numl2>1.</span>	The Bazach (a small spoon) was inside, overflowing with Ketores;</p>
<p class=secondindent><span class=numl2>2.</span>	It had a cover (Rosh - to preserve the smell), with a ring (alternatively - a piece of a garment) on top.</p>
