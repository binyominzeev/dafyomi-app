<p class="bas subject"><span class="nm">1)</span>CUTTING NAILS</p>
<p class="bas indent1"><span class="nm">(a)</span><span class="cl">Beraisa:</span> Just as it is forbidden to shave on Chol ha'Mo'ed and during mourning, so it is forbidden to cut one's nails on Chol ha'Mo'ed and during mourning. This is the opinion of R. Yehudah. R. Yosi, however, permits it both times.</p>
<p class="bas indent1"><span class="nm">(b)</span><span class="cl">Halachah:</span> Ula permits on Chol ha'Mo'ed and forbids during mourning. Shmuel permits both.</p>
<p class="bas indent1"><span class="nm">(c)</span>Story with Shmuel and his brother.</p>
<p class="bas indent2"><span class="nm">1.</span><span class="cl">Moral of the story:</span> Don't say things that are ominous. Things that are spoken out loud tend to come true.</p>
<p class="bas indent1"><span class="nm">(d)</span>Which nails may be cut according to Shmuel?</p>
<p class="bas indent2"><span class="nm">1.</span>At first the Gemara thought only fingernails, but toenails are forbidden.</p>
<p class="bas indent2"><span class="nm">2.</span>The Gemara discards this notion and rules that both are permitted.</p>
<p class="bas indent2"><span class="nm">3.</span>With a Genustera (Aruch - nailclipper; Rashi - scissors), however, it is forbidden.</p>
<p class="bas indent1"><span class="nm">(e)</span>Story with R. Yochanan, with three lessons:</p>
<p class="bas indent2"><span class="nm">1.</span>He held it is permitted to cut nails on Chol ha'Mo'ed</p>
<p class="bas indent2"><span class="nm">2.</span>It is not gross to bite your nails in front of other people (Rashi <b>MS</b>).</p>
<p class="bas indent2"><span class="nm">3.</span>One may throw one's nails on the floor.</p>
<p class="bas indent3"><span class="nm">i.</span><span class="cl">Question:</span> A Beraisa says that it is dangerous to discard nails on the floor; they should be buried or burned.</p>
<p class="bas indent3"><span class="nm">ii.</span><span class="cl">Answer:</span> The danger of nails on the floor is only for pregnant women, and pregnant women do not usually go into the Beis Midrash (where R. Yochanan threw his nails)</p>
<p class="bas indent1"><span class="nm">(f)</span>Rebbi permitted nails to be cut (during mourning - Rashi), and also permitted trimming the moustache.</p>
<p class="bas indent2"><span class="nm">1.</span>How much moustache may be cut?</p>
<p class="bas indent2"><span class="nm">2.</span><span class="cl">(Rav or Rav Papa):</span> The whole thing.</p>
<p class="bas indent2"><span class="nm">3.</span><span class="cl">(R. Ami):</span> This means only the part that bothers one when he eats.</p>
<p class="bas indent2"><span class="nm">4.</span><span class="cl">(R. Nachman bar Yitzchak):</span> The whole thing can be bothersome (he agrees with Rav or Rav Papa).</p>
<p class="bas indent2"><span class="nm">5.</span>Some Agadeta about Pharaoh.</p>
<p class="bas subject"><span class="nm">2)</span>SOME DETAILS ABOUT LAUNDERING ON CHOL HA'MO'ED</p>
<p class="bas indent1"><span class="nm">(a)</span><span class="cl">(R. Yochanan):</span> If someone owns only one robe he may wash it on Chol ha'Mo'ed</p>
<p class="bas indent1"><span class="nm">(b)</span><span class="cl">Question:</span> This case is not listed among the exceptions where laundering is permitted, in the Mishnah (above, 14a, 1:b).</p>
<p class="bas indent1"><span class="nm">(c)</span><span class="cl">Answer:</span> The Mishnah was not dealing with this kind of case, but only with cases of people who have more than one garment and they are all dirty. (Rashi: The case of one robe is too obvious for the Mishnah to mention.)</p>
<p class="bas indent1"><span class="nm">(d)</span><span class="cl">(Someone said in the name of R. Yochanan):</span> It is permitted to launder linen garments on Chol ha'Mo'ed (because they are easy to launder - Rashi, and because they get dirty quicker - Rashi <b>MS</b>.).</p>
<p class="bas indent1"><span class="nm">(e)</span><span class="cl">Question:</span> The Mishnah does not list this among the exceptions.</p>
<p class="bas bbbline">18b----------------------------------------18b</p>
<p class="bas indent1"><span class="nm">(f)</span><span class="cl">Answer:</span> The Mishnah was not dealing with linen, but only with woolen clothing. (Rashi: The case of linen clothing is too obvious for the Mishnah to mention.)</p>
<p class="bas indent1"><span class="nm">(g)</span><span class="cl">(Bar Hedya):</span> Saw people laundering linen clothing on Chol ha'Mo'ed in Teveryah.</p>
<p class="bas indent1"><span class="nm">(h)</span><span class="cl">(Abaye):</span> This doesn't prove anything; they might not have bothered to ask the rabbis if it was permitted.</p>
<p class="bas subject"><span class="nm">3)</span><i>MISHNAH</i> - DOCUMENTS THAT MAY BE WRITTEN ON CHOL HA'MO'ED</p>
<p class="bas indent1"><span class="nm">(a)</span>The following documents may be written on Chol ha'Mo'ed, because a delay would result in a loss:</p>
<p class="bas indent2"><span class="nm">1.</span>A document of Kidushin.</p>
<p class="bas indent2"><span class="nm">2.</span>A Get</p>
<p class="bas indent2"><span class="nm">3.</span>A receipt</p>
<p class="bas indent2"><span class="nm">4.</span>A will</p>
<p class="bas indent2"><span class="nm">5.</span>A deed of a gift</p>
<p class="bas indent2"><span class="nm">6.</span>A Pruzbul (for Shemitah)</p>
<p class="bas indent2"><span class="nm">7.</span>A document of assessment of property by the court.</p>
<p class="bas indent2"><span class="nm">8.</span>A document obligating someone to support his stepchild.</p>

<p class="bas indent2"><span class="nm">10.</span>A document attesting that Mi'un was performed.</p>
<p class="bas indent2"><span class="nm">11.</span>A document attesting to a decision of the court to divide a property in a particular manner. (Rashi. According to others, it is a document attesting to the agreement of the litigants to use three particular judges for their case.)</p>
<p class="bas indent2"><span class="nm">12.</span>Documents announcing decrees of the court.</p>
<p class="bas indent2"><span class="nm">13.</span>Documents concerning governmental rulings.</p>
<p class="bas subject"><span class="nm">4)</span><i>GEMARA</i> - DOING <i>KIDUSHIN</i> ON CHOL HA'MO'ED</p>
<p class="bas indent1"><span class="nm">(a)</span><span class="cl">Statement (Shmuel):</span> It is permitted to do Kidushin (betrothal) on Chol ha'Mo'ed (although it is forbidden to marry - above, 8b). This is permitted so that he may lay claim to the woman before someone else beats him to it.</p>
<p class="bas indent1"><span class="nm">(b)</span><span class="cl">Proof:</span> The Mishnah permits the writing of documents of Kidushin on Chol ha'Mo'ed, so obviously the Kidushin is taking place on Chol ha'Mo'ed</p>
<p class="bas indent1"><span class="nm">(c)</span><span class="cl">Rejection:</span> Perhaps the Mishnah refers not to the Shtar used to effect Kidushin itself, but to a document outlining the financial obligations of the two families upon betrothal.</p>
<p class="bas indent1"><span class="nm">(d)</span><span class="cl">Proof:</span> The Mishnah above (8b) prohibits only marrying, implying that mere Kidushin is permitted.</p>
<p class="bas indent1"><span class="nm">(e)</span><span class="cl">Rejection:</span> On the contrary, Kidushin has more of a reason to be forbidden than marriage, for the latter is a Mitzvah while the former is not. Thus, perhaps if the Mishnah forbade marriage, it certainly means to forbid Kidushin.</p>
<p class="bas indent1"><span class="nm">(f)</span><span class="cl">Proof:</span> A Beraisa states explicitly that it is permitted to do Kidushin on Chol ha'Mo'ed</p>
<p class="bas indent1"><span class="nm">(g)</span><span class="cl">Question:</span> Why does Shmuel express concern (above, 4:a) that someone might beat this man to marrying this woman if he does not hurry to betroth her? Shmuel is the one who said that all marriages are pre-ordained in heaven! Whatever happens is supposed to happen; no rushing will help!</p>
<p class="bas indent1"><span class="nm">(h)</span><span class="cl">Answer:</span> It is possible to change the pre-ordained plan through prayer.</p>
<p class="bas subject"><span class="nm">5)</span>AGADETA</p>
<p class="bas indent1"><span class="nm">(a)</span>Shmuel's concept, that matches are pre-ordained, is alluded to several times in Tanach.</p>
<p class="bas indent1"><span class="nm">(b)</span>A person is never suspected of a misdeed unless he is guilty, in some sense, to some degree, of that misdeed.</p>
<p class="bas subject"><span class="nm">6)</span><i>MISHNAH</i> - THINGS THAT MAY NOT BE WRITTEN ON CHOL HA'MO'ED</p>
<p class="bas indent1"><span class="nm">(a)</span>The following may not be written on Chol ha'Mo'ed, because they can wait:</p>
<p class="bas indent2"><span class="nm">1.</span>An <b>IOU</b>, unless:</p>
<p class="bas indent3"><span class="nm">i.</span>the lender refuses to lend the money without it, or</p>
<p class="bas indent3"><span class="nm">ii.</span>the scribe needs the money thus earned for basic food</p>
<p class="bas indent2"><span class="nm">2.</span>Sifrei Torah, Tefilin, Mezuzos. Even a small correction in a Sefer Torah may not be made.</p>
<p class="bas indent2"><span class="nm">3.</span>R. Yehudah does permit writing Tefilin and Mezuzos for one's own use, and spinning Tzitzis threads with a Shinui.</p>
