<p class="bas subject"><span class="nm">1)</span>OTHER RESOLUTIONS OF THE MISHNAH</p>
<p class="bas indent1"><span class="nm">(a)</span><span class="cl">Answer #2 (R. Elazar):</span> The entire Mishnah is like R. Tarfon. The Reisha discusses a field in which only the victim may leave fruit, and both the victim and damager may have animals;</p>
<p class="bas indent2"><span class="nm">1.</span>Regarding Shen, it is like the victim's yard. Regarding Keren, it is like Reshus ha'Rabim.</p>
<p class="bas indent1"><span class="nm">(b)</span><span class="cl">Objection (Rav Zevid of Neharda'a - Mishnah):</span> Shen is Mu'ad to eat what is fitting for it;</p>
<p class="bas indent2"><span class="nm">1.</span><span class="cl">Inference:</span> It is not Mu'ad for something it does not normally eat.</p>
<p class="bas indent2"><span class="nm">2.</span>Eating something it does not normally eat is Keren. R. Tarfon obligates full damage in the victim's Reshus!</p>
<p class="bas indent1"><span class="nm">(c)</span><span class="cl">Answer #3 (Rav Zvid):</span> The entire Mishnah is like Chachamim. It is abbreviated, and means as follows. There are five Tam damagers. If they damage repeatedly, they become Mu'ad.</p>
<p class="bas indent2"><span class="nm">1.</span>Shen and Regel are Mu'ad from the beginning. This is in the victim's premises.</p>
<p class="bas indent1"><span class="nm">(d)</span><span class="cl">Version #1 - Objection (Ravina - a later Mishnah):</span> An ox that damages in the victim's premises. What is the case?</p>
<p class="bas indent2"><span class="nm">1.</span>The Mishnah would ask 'what is the case' only about something that was already taught! (According to Rav Zvid, the Mishnah did not discuss Keren in the victim's premises.)</p>
<p class="bas indent1"><span class="nm">(e)</span><span class="cl">Answer #4 (Ravina):</span> The Mishnah is abbreviated. It means as follows. There are five Tam damagers. If they damage repeatedly, they become Mu'ad;</p>
<p class="bas indent2"><span class="nm">1.</span>Shen and Regel are Mu'ad from the beginning;</p>
<p class="bas indent2"><span class="nm">2.</span>The Mu'ad that the Torah mentions is one of the five Tam damagers that damaged repeatedly;</p>
<p class="bas indent2"><span class="nm">3.</span>If an ox damaged in the victim's premises, R. Tarfon and Chachamim argue about this;</p>
<p class="bas indent2"><span class="nm">4.</span>There are also other Mu'adim - a wolf, lion, bear, leopard, Bardelus, and snake.</p>
<p class="bas indent1"><span class="nm">(f)</span>A Beraisa explains exactly like Ravina.</p>
<p class="bas indent1"><span class="nm">(g)</span><span class="cl">Version #2 - Question:</span> The Mishnah says that there are (only) five Tamim and five Mu'adim. There are more!</p>
<p class="bas indent2"><span class="nm">1.</span>Also a wolf, lion, bear, leopard, Bardelus, and snake are Mu'adim!</p>
<p class="bas indent1"><span class="nm">(h)</span><span class="cl">Answer (Ravina):</span> The Mishnah is abbreviated. It means as follows. There are five Tam damagers (like he explained in Version #1)...</p>
<p class="bas subject"><span class="nm">2)</span>CROUCHING</p>
<p class="bas indent1"><span class="nm">(a)</span><span class="cl">(Mishnah):</span> An animal is not Mu'ad to crouch...</p>
<p class="bas indent1"><span class="nm">(b)</span><span class="cl">Version #1 (R. Elazar):</span> This refers only to big Kelim. It is normal for it to crouch and break small Kelim.</p>
<p class="bas indent1"><span class="nm">(c)</span><span class="cl">Support (for R. Elazar - Beraisa):</span> An animal is Mu'ad to walk and to break and crush people, animals and Kelim. (It crushes small people, animals and Kelim by crouching.)</p>
<p class="bas indent1"><span class="nm">(d)</span><span class="cl">Rejection:</span> Perhaps it crushes them against a wall (without crouching).</p>
<p class="bas indent1"><span class="nm">(e)</span><span class="cl">Version #2 (R. Elazar):</span> It is abnormal to crouch and break not only big Kelim, rather, even small Kelim.</p>
<p class="bas indent1"><span class="nm">(f)</span><span class="cl">Question (Beraisa):</span> An animal is Mu'ad to walk and to break and crush people, animals and Kelim.</p>
<p class="bas indent1"><span class="nm">(g)</span><span class="cl">Answer (R. Elazar):</span> Perhaps it crushes them against a wall.</p>
<p class="bas indent1"><span class="nm">(h)</span><span class="cl">Version #3 - Question (Mishnah):</span> An animal is not Mu'ad to crouch;</p>
<p class="bas indent2"><span class="nm">1.</span><span class="cl">Contradiction (Beraisa):</span> ...(It is Mu'ad to)...crush people, animals and Kelim.</p>
<p class="bas indent1"><span class="nm">(i)</span><span class="cl">Answer (R. Elazar):</span> It is Mu'ad to crouch on small Kelim, but not on big ones.</p>
<p class="bas subject"><span class="nm">3)</span>OTHER <i>MU'AD</i> ANIMALS</p>
<p class="bas indent1"><span class="nm">(a)</span><span class="cl">(Mishnah):</span> A wolf, lion...</p>
<p class="bas indent1"><span class="nm">(b)</span><span class="cl">Question:</span> What is a Bardelus?</p>
<p class="bas indent1"><span class="nm">(c)</span><span class="cl">Answer #1 (Rav Yosef):</span> It is an Apa (snake?).</p>
<p class="bas indent1"><span class="nm">(d)</span><span class="cl">Question (Beraisa - R. Meir):</span> (In addition to those of our Mishnah), even a Tzavu'a (hyena?) is Mu'ad;</p>
<p class="bas indent2"><span class="nm">1.</span>R. Elazar says, even a snake.</p>
<p class="bas indent2"><span class="nm">2.</span><span class="cl">(Rav Yosef):</span> Tzavu'a is an Apa. (R. Meir said that it is not listed in our Mishnah!)</p>
<p class="bas indent1"><span class="nm">(e)</span><span class="cl">Answer:</span> Bardelus is Apa, i.e. a female Tzavu'a. R. Meir adds, even a male Tzavu'a. (Some switch the genders.)</p>
<p class="bas indent2"><span class="nm">1.</span><span class="cl">(Beraisa):</span> A male Tzavu'a changes every seven years. It becomes a bat, then a small bat, then a Kimush, then a Chu'ach, then a Shed (demon).</p>
<p class="bas indent2"><span class="nm">2.</span>A human spine becomes a snake after seven years if he does not bow at 'Modim'.</p>
<p class="bas indent1"><span class="nm">(f)</span><span class="cl">Question (Beraisa - R. Meir):</span> (In addition to those of our Mishnah), even a Tzavu'a;</p>
<p class="bas indent2"><span class="nm">1.</span>R. Elazar says, even a snake.</p>
<p class="bas bbbline">16b----------------------------------------16b</p>
<p class="bas indent2"><span class="nm">2.</span><span class="cl">Contradiction (Mishnah - R. Elazar):</span> If it (a wolf, lion...) is domesticated, it is not Mu'ad!</p>
<p class="bas indent1"><span class="nm">(g)</span><span class="cl">Correction:</span> The Beraisa should say 'R. Elazar says, (only) a snake is Mu'ad.'</p>
<p class="bas subject"><span class="nm">4)</span>HOW LIONS NORMALLY EAT</p>
<p class="bas indent1"><span class="nm">(a)</span><span class="cl">(Shmuel):</span> If a lion ate from an animal (without killing it) in Reshus ha'Rabim, it is exempt. If it first killed the animal, it is liable.</p>
<p class="bas indent2"><span class="nm">1.</span>It is exempt for eating without killing, for this is normal. Shen is exempt in a Reshus ha'Rabim;</p>
<p class="bas indent2"><span class="nm">2.</span>If it first killed the animal, it is liable, for this is abnormal. Keren is liable in a Reshus ha'Rabim.</p>
<p class="bas indent1"><span class="nm">(b)</span><span class="cl">Question:</span> Is it really abnormal for a lion to kill an animal? "A lion tears (kills) for its cubs"!</p>
<p class="bas indent1"><span class="nm">(c)</span><span class="cl">Answer:</span> A lion tears for its cubs, but not for itself.</p>
<p class="bas indent1"><span class="nm">(d)</span><span class="cl">Question:</span> "And it chokes (kills prey, and brings it) to female lions."</p>
<p class="bas indent1"><span class="nm">(e)</span><span class="cl">Answer:</span> It chokes to bring prey to female lions (but not for itself to eat).</p>
<p class="bas indent1"><span class="nm">(f)</span><span class="cl">Question:</span> "And it fills (holes of) its dwelling with torn animals."</p>
<p class="bas indent1"><span class="nm">(g)</span><span class="cl">Answer:</span> It kills to fill its dwelling, but not to eat immediately.</p>
<p class="bas indent1"><span class="nm">(h)</span><span class="cl">Question (Beraisa):</span> Also a Chayah (i.e. just like a lion) that entered the victim's premises, tore an animal and ate meat, pays full damage.</p>
<p class="bas indent1"><span class="nm">(i)</span><span class="cl">Answer #1:</span> The case is, it tore the animal to store it.</p>
<p class="bas indent2"><span class="nm">1.</span><span class="cl">Question:</span> It says that it ate meat!</p>
<p class="bas indent2"><span class="nm">2.</span><span class="cl">Answer:</span> It tore it intending to store it, then it reconsidered and ate it.</p>
<p class="bas indent2"><span class="nm">3.</span><span class="cl">Objection #1:</span> How would we know this?</p>
<p class="bas indent2"><span class="nm">4.</span><span class="cl">Objection #2:</span> Shmuel said that one pays if it kills. He should be concerned lest it tore to store up, then reconsidered!</p>
<p class="bas indent1"><span class="nm">(j)</span><span class="cl">Answer #2 (Rav Nachman bar Yitzchak):</span> The Beraisa means that if it tore an animal to store it or it ate meat without killing, it pays full damage.</p>
<p class="bas indent1"><span class="nm">(k)</span><span class="cl">Answer #3 (Ravina):</span> Shmuel discusses a domesticated lion, according to R. Elazar.</p>
<p class="bas indent1"><span class="nm">(l)</span><span class="cl">Question:</span> If so, even eating without killing should be considered abnormal!</p>
<p class="bas indent1"><span class="nm">(m)</span><span class="cl">Correction:</span> Ravina did not explain Shmuel. Rather, he meant that the Beraisa discusses a domesticated lion, according to R. Elazar.</p>
<p class="bas indent1"><span class="nm">(n)</span><span class="cl">Question:</span> If so, it should only pay half-damage!</p>
<p class="bas indent1"><span class="nm">(o)</span><span class="cl">Answer:</span> The case is, it became Mu'ad.</p>
<p class="bas indent1"><span class="nm">(p)</span><span class="cl">Question:</span> If so, why was this taught regarding Toldos of Shen? It is a Toldah of Keren!</p>
<p class="bas indent1"><span class="nm">(q)</span>This is left difficult.</p>
<p class="bas subject"><span class="nm">5)</span>THE DIFFERENCE BETWEEN <i>TAM</i> AND <i>MU'AD</i></p>
<p class="bas indent1"><span class="nm">(a)</span><span class="cl">(Mishnah):</span> The difference between Tam and Mu'ad is that Tam pays half-damage mi'Gufo (up to its own value), and Mu'ad pays full damage from the Aliyah.</p>
<p class="bas indent1"><span class="nm">(b)</span><span class="cl">(Gemara) Question:</span> What is 'the Aliyah?'</p>
<p class="bas indent1"><span class="nm">(c)</span><span class="cl">Answer (R. Elazar):</span> It is the Me'ulah (best) of the damager's property.</p>
<p class="bas indent2"><span class="nm">1.</span><span class="cl">(R. Elazar):</span> "They buried (Chizkiyahu) in Ma'alei of the tombs of the house of David" - near the best of the family, David and Shlomo.</p>
<p class="bas subject"><span class="nm">6)</span>AGADIC TEACHINGS OF R. ELAZAR</p>
<p class="bas indent1"><span class="nm">(a)</span><span class="cl">Question:</span> "They buried (Asa) in the bed... full of fragrances and Zenim" - what are these?</p>
<p class="bas indent1"><span class="nm">(b)</span><span class="cl">Answer #1 (R. Elazar):</span> They are many types of fragrances.</p>
<p class="bas indent1"><span class="nm">(c)</span><span class="cl">Answer #2 (R. Shmuel bar Nachmani):</span> They are fragrances that incite people to Zimah (immorality).</p>
<p class="bas indent1"><span class="nm">(d)</span><span class="cl">(R. Elazar):</span> "They dug a pit to trap me" - people suspected Yirmiyahu that sinned with a Zonah;</p>
<p class="bas indent1"><span class="nm">(e)</span><span class="cl">(R. Shmuel bar Nachmani):</span> They suspected that he sinned with a married woman.</p>
<p class="bas indent1"><span class="nm">(f)</span><span class="cl">Question:</span> Granted, R. Elazar learns from "a Zonah is a deep pit";</p>
<p class="bas indent1"><span class="nm">(g)</span><span class="cl">Question:</span> What is R. Shmuel's source?</p>
<p class="bas indent1"><span class="nm">(h)</span><span class="cl">Answer:</span> A married woman who has adultery is also a Zonah!</p>
<p class="bas indent1"><span class="nm">(i)</span><span class="cl">Question:</span> "All their counsel is upon me, to die" applies to Bi'ah with a married woman, not with a Zonah!</p>
<p class="bas indent1"><span class="nm">(j)</span><span class="cl">Answer:</span> They cast him into a pit of mud (to kill him).</p>
<p class="bas indent1"><span class="nm">(k)</span><span class="cl">(Rava):</span> "They should stumble in front of you" - (Yirmiyahu requested that those who seek to harm him,) even when they give Tzedakah, make them stumble, by presenting them with unworthy recipients, so they will not get reward.</p>
