<div class="subject"><span class="nm">1)</span><p>THE SHI'URIM FOR PEOPLE WHO ARE DIFFERENT</p></div>
<div class="indent1"><span class="nm">(a)</span><p><span class="cl">Objection (Abaye):</span> Are Persians the majority of the world?! (The Halachah is not based on a minority practice!)</p></div>
<div class="indent2"><span class="nm">1.</span><p><span class="cl">(Beraisa):</span> Clothes proper for Aniyim (e.g. cloth three by three fingers, it can be used for a patch) are Mekabel Tum'ah (Tosfos - of Mishkav u'Moshav) if an Oni owns them. Clothes proper for Ashirim (rich people, e.g. three by three Tefachim) are Mekabel Tum'ah even for Ashirim;</p></div>
<div class="indent2"><span class="nm">2.</span><p>An Oni's clothes need not befit an Ashir. (Since they befit the Oni, even though they do not befit others, the smaller Shi'ur is Mekabel Tum'ah. Likewise, since roasted meat is an accompaniment for most people, the smaller Shi'ur should suffice for an Eruv!)</p></div>
<div class="indent2"><span class="nm">3.</span><p><span class="cl">Suggestion:</span> We are stringent in both cases [to be Metamei for the smaller Shi'ur, and to require more food for an Eruv]!</p></div>
<div class="indent2"><span class="nm">4.</span><p><span class="cl">Rejection (Beraisa - R. Shimon ben Elazar):</span> We may be Me'arev for one who is sick or old with the amount of food he eats (it is less than for average people), and for a gluttonous person with the amount that average people eat.</p></div>
<div class="indent1"><span class="nm">(b)</span><p>This is left difficult.</p></div>
<div class="indent1"><span class="nm">(c)</span><p><span class="cl">Question:</span> R. Shimon ben Elazar is not lenient in both directions!</p></div>
<div class="indent2"><span class="nm">1.</span><p><span class="cl">(Beraisa - R. Shimon ben Elazar):</span> [If a Mes is in a house and all its openings are closed, every opening is Tamei, i.e. it is Metamei whatever is under the lintel. If an opening or a window four by four Tefachim was opened, it is Tamei and saves (is Metaher) the others. A giant such as] Og Melech ha'Bashan requires an opening through which he can fit. (If there is no such opening, all openings the size of a normal fist are Temei'im.)</p></div>
<div class="indent1"><span class="nm">(d)</span><p><span class="cl">Answer (Abaye):</span> There, it is unreasonable for a small opening to save - will they cut up the Mes into pieces to take it out?! (The text 'v'Abaye...' suggests that the question was against Abaye. Seemingly, the Beraisos contradict each other! Maharsha - this is because Abaye brought the first Beraisa, i.e. it was not widely known.)</p></div>
<div class="indent1"><span class="nm">(e)</span><p><span class="cl">Question:</span> Do Chachamim argue with R. Shimon ben Elazar?</p></div>
<div class="indent1"><span class="nm">(f)</span><p><span class="cl">Answer:</span> Rabah bar bar Chanah taught that four Tefachim is an opening for Og Melech ha'Bashan.</p></div>
<div class="indent1"><span class="nm">(g)</span><p><span class="cl">Rejection:</span> The case is, all of the other openings are less than four. Surely, they will widen that opening to take him out!</p></div>
<div class="indent1"><span class="nm">(h)</span><p><span class="cl">(Rav Chiya bar Rav Ashi):</span> One may be Me'arev with raw meat.</p></div>
<div class="indent1"><span class="nm">(i)</span><p><span class="cl">(Rav Simi bar Chiya):</span> One may be Me'arev with raw eggs.</p></div>
<div class="indent1"><span class="nm">(j)</span><p><span class="cl">Question:</span> How many are required?</p></div>
<div class="indent1"><span class="nm">(k)</span><p><span class="cl">Answer (Rav Nachman bar Yitzchak):</span> Rav Yosef requires two.</p></div>
<div class="subject"><span class="nm">2)</span><p>FOOD FORBIDDEN BY AN OATH OR VOW</p></div>
<div class="indent1"><span class="nm">(a)</span><p><span class="cl">(Mishnah):</span> If one vowed to forbid Mazon [to himself], he is permitted water and salt.</p></div>
<div class="indent1"><span class="nm">(b)</span><p><span class="cl">Inference:</span> Water and salt are not called Mazon, but everything else is called Mazon!</p></div>
<div class="indent1"><span class="nm">(c)</span><p><span class="cl">Suggestion:</span> This refutes Rav and Shmuel!</p></div>
<div class="indent2"><span class="nm">1.</span><p><span class="cl">(Rav and Shmuel):</span> We bless Borei Minei Mezonos only on the five grains.</p></div>
<div class="indent2"><span class="nm">2.</span><p><span class="cl">Question:</span> They were already refuted!</p></div>
<div class="indent2"><span class="nm">3.</span><p><span class="cl">Answer:</span> We suggest that also our Mishnah refutes them. (This is astounding, for everyone knows the Mishnayos!)</p></div>
<div class="indent1"><span class="nm">(d)</span><p><span class="cl">Rejection (Rav Huna):</span> The Mishnah discusses one who forbade 'anything that is Zan' (satiates. This includes everything except for water and salt. However, only what sustains, i.e. the five grains, is called Mazon.)</p></div>
<div class="indent1"><span class="nm">(e)</span><p><span class="cl">Inference:</span> Water and salt do not satiate, but everything else does.</p></div>
<div class="indent1"><span class="nm">(f)</span><p><span class="cl">Question:</span> Rabah bar bar Chanah said 'when we followed R. Yochanan to eat Peros Ginosar (sweet fruits from near the Kineret):</p></div>
<div class="indent2"><span class="nm">1.</span><p>If there were 100 of us, everyone would take 10 fruits for him. If there were 10 of us, everyone would take 100. (In any case, we took 1000 for him.) A three-Se'ah basket would [Maharshal - not] hold 100 fruits;</p></div>
<div class="indent2"><span class="nm">2.</span><p>He would eat them, and swear that he did not taste Ziyuna (anything satiating).</p></div>
<div class="indent1"><span class="nm">(g)</span><p><span class="cl">Answer:</span> Rather, R. Yochanan swore that he did not taste Mazona (something that sustains).</p></div>
<div class="indent1"><span class="nm">(h)</span><p><span class="cl">(Rav Huna):</span> If one swore not to eat a loaf, (a Shevu'ah does not forbid benefit, therefore) he may be Me'arev with it. (Others could eat it);</p></div>
<div class="indent1"><span class="nm">(i)</span><p>If he vowed 'it is Alai', he may not be Me'arev with it. (This is a Neder, which forbids all benefit from it.)</p></div>
<div class="indent1"><span class="nm">(j)</span><p><span class="cl">Question (Beraisa):</span> If one vowed not to eat a loaf, we may be Me'arev for him with it.</p></div>
<div class="indent2"><span class="nm">1.</span><p><span class="cl">Suggestion:</span> He said '[It is] Alai'.</p></div>
<div class="indent1"><span class="nm">(k)</span><p><span class="cl">Answer:</span> No, he swore '[I will not eat] this'.</p></div>
<div class="indent1"><span class="nm">(l)</span><p><span class="cl">Support (the middle clause):</span> This is if he said 'I swear that I will not taste it.'</p></div>
<div class="indent1"><span class="nm">(m)</span><p><span class="cl">Inference:</span> If he said 'Alai', he may not be Me'arev with it;</p></div>
<div class="indent1"><span class="nm">(n)</span><p><span class="cl">Question:</span> If so, why does the Seifa teach that one may not be Me'arev with Hekdesh? Rather, it should distinguish regarding Chulin! He may be Me'arev with it if he swore not to eat 'it', but not if he said 'Alai''</p></div>
<div class="indent2"><span class="nm">1.</span><p><span class="cl">Counter-question:</span> You hold that even if he said 'Alai', he may be Me'arev with it. This is unlike the middle clause!</p></div>
<div class="indent2"><span class="nm">2.</span><p><span class="cl">Answer:</span> The Beraisa is abbreviated. It means as follows. If one vowed not to eat a loaf, we may be Me'arev for him with it. This is even if he said 'Alai', it is as if he said 'I swear not to taste it.'</p></div>
<div class="indent1"><span class="nm">(o)</span><p>The question (m) against Rav Huna remains!</p></div>
<div class="indent1"><span class="nm">(p)</span><p><span class="cl">Answer:</span> He holds like R. Eliezer:</p></div>
<div class="indent2"><span class="nm">1.</span><p><span class="cl">(Beraisa - R. Eliezer):</span> If one swore 'I will not eat this loaf', we may be Me'arev for him with it;</p></div>

<div class="indent2"><span class="nm">1.</span><p><span class="cl">(Beraisa):</span> The general rule is, if a person forbids himself to [eat] a food (i.e. a Shevu'ah), we may be Me'arev for him with it.

<div class="indent2"><span class="nm">2.</span><p>R. Eliezer says, if he said 'it is Alai', we may be Me'arev for him with it. If he said 'it is Hekdesh', we may not be Me'arev for him with it, because we do not Me'arev with Hekdesh.</p></div>
<div class="indent1"><span class="nm">(r)</span><p><span class="cl">Answer:</span> Tana'im argue about the opinion of R. Eliezer.</p></div>

<div class="indent1"><span class="nm">(a)</span><p><span class="cl">(Mishnah):</span> We may be Me'arev for a Nazir with wine.</p></div>
<div class="indent1"><span class="nm">(b)</span><p>Our Mishnah is unlike Beis Shamai;</p></div>
<div class="indent2"><span class="nm">1.</span><p><span class="cl">(Beraisa #1 - Beis Shamai):</span> We may not be Me'arev for a Nazir with wine, or for a Yisrael with Terumah.</p></div>
<div class="indent2"><span class="nm">2.</span><p><span class="cl">Beis Hillel:</span> Surely you agree that we may be Me'arev for an adult on Yom Kipur [even though only children may eat]!</p></div>

<div class="indent2"><span class="nm">3.</span><p><span class="cl">Beis Shamai:</span> We agree.</p></div>
<div class="indent2"><span class="nm">4.</span><p><span class="cl">Beis Hillel:</span> Just like we may be Me'arev for an adult on Yom Kipur, we may be Me'arev for a Nazir with wine, or for a Yisrael with Terumah.</p></div>
<div class="indent2"><span class="nm">5.</span><p><span class="cl">Beis Shamai:</span> No. An adult was permitted to eat the Eruv before dark [on Erev Yom Kipur], but wine and Terumah were forbidden to a Nazir or Yisrael even before dark!</p></div>
<div class="indent1"><span class="nm">(c)</span><p><span class="cl">Suggestion:</span> This is unlike Chananyah:</p></div>
<div class="indent2"><span class="nm">1.</span><p><span class="cl">(Beraisa #2 - Chananyah):</span> Beis Shamai disqualify an Eruv, unless he takes his bed and all Kelim he needs [for Shabbos] to the desired place [of Shevisah. In Beraisa #1, Beis Shamai hold that an Eruv helps without this.]</p></div>
<div class="indent1"><span class="nm">(d)</span><p><span class="cl">Question:</span> Who is the Tana of the following Beraisa?</p></div>
<div class="indent2"><span class="nm">1.</span><p><span class="cl">(Beraisa):</span> If one was Me'arev with black clothing, he may not rely on it to go out with white clothing, and vice-versa.</p></div>
<div class="indent1"><span class="nm">(e)</span><p><span class="cl">Answer (Rav Nachman bar Yitzchak):</span> Chananyah taught it, according to Beis Shamai.</p></div>
<div class="indent1"><span class="nm">(f)</span><p><span class="cl">Objection:</span> Chananyah forbids [according to Beis Shamai] to go out with black clothing if he was Me'arev with [only] white. This implies that he may go out with white clothing;</p></div>
<div class="indent2"><span class="nm">1.</span><p>Chananyah requires taking out the bed and <i>all</i> Kelim that he needs!</p></div>
<div class="indent1"><span class="nm">(g)</span><p><span class="cl">Correction:</span> It means that if he was Me'arev with white clothing and needed black clothing, he may not go out even with white clothing.</p></div>

<div class="indent1"><span class="nm">(i)</span><p><span class="cl">Answer (Rav Nachman bar Yitzchak):</span> Chananyah taught it; according to Beis Shamai.</p></div>
<div class="indent1"><span class="nm">(j)</span><p><span class="cl">(Mishnah - Sumchus):</span> He must be Me'arev with Chulin.</p></div>
<div class="indent1"><span class="nm">(k)</span><p><span class="cl">Inference:</span> Sumchus argues only here, but he agrees that a Nazir can be Me'arev with wine.</p></div>
<div class="indent1"><span class="nm">(l)</span><p><span class="cl">Question:</span> What is the reason?</p></div>
<div class="indent1"><span class="nm">(m)</span><p><span class="cl">Answer:</span> He could regret his vow of Nezirus and ask a Chacham to annul it.</p></div>
<div class="indent1"><span class="nm">(n)</span><p><span class="cl">Question:</span> If so, he should also permit an Eruv of Terumah for a Yisrael, since it is possible to annul making it Terumah!</p></div>
<div class="indent1"><span class="nm">(o)</span><p><span class="cl">Answer #1:</span> If he would do so, it would revert to being Tevel.</p></div>
<div class="indent2"><span class="nm">1.</span><p><span class="cl">Question:</span> He could make other food [elsewhere] Terumah to permit the Eruv!</p></div>
<div class="indent2"><span class="nm">2.</span><p><span class="cl">Answer:</span> We do not suspect lest a Chaver (someone trustworthy about Terumah) be Torem (declare Terumah) Lo Min ha'Mukaf (i.e. when the Terumah is not near the Tevel that it exempts, for this is forbidden).</p></div>
<div class="indent2"><span class="nm">3.</span><p><span class="cl">Question:</span> He could make some of the Eruv itself Terumah to permit the rest!</p></div>
<div class="indent2"><span class="nm">4.</span><p><span class="cl">Answer:</span> The case is, there is a minimal Shi'ur for the Eruv. If he makes some of it Terumah, less than the Shi'ur will remain.</p></div>
<div class="indent2"><span class="nm">5.</span><p><span class="cl">Objection:</span> Why should we assume that this is the case? (The Mishnah implies that Sumchus never permits Terumah!)</p></div>
<div class="indent1"><span class="nm">(p)</span><p><span class="cl">Answer #2:</span> Sumchus holds like Chachamim, who forbid Shevus (mid'Rabanan Isurim of Shabbos. This includes separating Terumah) Bein ha'Shemashos. (Therefore, he cannot permit the Eruv at this time.)</p></div>
<div class="indent1"><span class="nm">(q)</span><p><span class="cl">Question:</span> Who is the Tana of the following Mishnah?</p></div>
<div class="indent2"><span class="nm">1.</span><p><span class="cl">(Mishnah):</span> [The Shi'urim of] some things are according to the size of the person himself: Kometz of a Minchah (the handful taken and burned on the Mizbe'ach), the double handful of Ketores (the Kohen Gadol burns it in the Kodesh ha'Kodoshim on Yom Kipur), drinking Malei Lugmav (the amount that one can hold in his mouth when one cheek sticks out, to be liable) on Yom Kipur, and food for two meals for an Eruv.</p></div>
<div class="indent1"><span class="nm">(r)</span><p><span class="cl">Answer (R. Zeira):</span> It is like Sumchus, who says that one must be able to eat his Eruv.</p></div>
<div class="indent1"><span class="nm">(s)</span><p><span class="cl">Suggestion:</span> The Mishnah argues with R. Shimon ben Elazar:</p></div>
<div class="indent2"><span class="nm">1.</span><p><span class="cl">(Beraisa - R. Shimon ben Elazar):</span> We may be Me'arev for one who is sick or old with the amount of food he eats, and for a gluttonous person with the amount that an average person eats.</p></div>
<div class="indent1"><span class="nm">(t)</span><p><span class="cl">Rejection:</span> It can be like R. Shimon. The Shi'ur of two meals for an Eruv is according to the person himself regarding a sick or old person. We are not concerned for the habits of a glutton, for the Halachah is based on normal people.</p></div>
<div class="subject"><span class="nm">4)</span><p>AN ERUV IN A BEIS HA'PRAS</p></div>
<div class="indent1"><span class="nm">(a)</span><p><span class="cl">(Mishnah):</span> One may be Me'arev for a Kohen in Beis ha'Pras.</p></div>
<div class="indent1"><span class="nm">(b)</span><p>This is due to Rav Yehudah's teaching;</p></div>
<div class="indent2"><span class="nm">1.</span><p><span class="cl">(Rav Yehudah):</span> A person may walk through a Beis ha'Pras if he bends down and blows the dirt before each step [to clear away any small bones that might be there].</p></div>
<div class="indent2"><span class="nm">2.</span><p><span class="cl">(Rav Yehudah bar Ashi citing Rav Yehudah):</span> If many people walked through a Beis ha'Pras, it is Tahor (we assume that any bones have been crushed to less than the Shi'ur to be Metamei, i.e. the size of a barley seed).</p></div>
<div class="indent1"><span class="nm">(c)</span><p><span class="cl">(Mishnah - R. Yehudah):</span> One may be Me'arev for a Kohen even in a cemetery.</p></div>
<div class="indent1"><span class="nm">(d)</span><p><span class="cl">(Beraisa):</span> This is because he could be shielded from Tum'as Ohel by going in a coach or box.</p></div>
<div class="indent1"><span class="nm">(e)</span><p>He holds that an Ohel <i>Zaruk</i> (moving on the ground) is considered an Ohel. (If it is above Tum'as Mes, it is Metamei what is underneath it, and what is above remains Tahor. Tosfos - all agree that an airborne Ohel is not an Ohel.)</p></div>
<div class="indent1"><span class="nm">(f)</span><p>(The first Tana permits in a Beis ha'Pras, but not in a cemetery.) He and R. Yehudah argue like the following Tana'im;</p></div>
