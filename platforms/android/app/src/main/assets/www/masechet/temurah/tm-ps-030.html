<p class="bas subject"><span class="nm">1)</span>WHEN IS AN <i>ESNAN</i> CONSIDERED <i>PASUL</i>?</p>
<p class="bas indent1"><span class="nm">(a)</span><span class="cl">Answer:</span> The Beraisa is like R. Elazar, who says that if a man had Zenus with an unmarried woman, she becomes a Zonah. (Presumably, just like R. Elazar is stringent about what makes a Zonah, he is stringent about when Esnan is Pasul.)</p>
<p class="bas indent1"><span class="nm">(b)</span><span class="cl">Question:</span> If the Beraisa is like R. Elazar, it should disqualify an Esnan given to an unmarried woman!</p>
<p class="bas indent1"><span class="nm">(c)</span><span class="cl">Answer:</span> There is a Chidush to disqualify an Esnan from a Kohen Gadol to a widow;</p>
<p class="bas indent2"><span class="nm">1.</span><span class="cl">Version #1 (Rashi):</span> Had it mentioned an unmarried woman, we might have thought that only such cases of Esnan are Posel, but not if she is forbidden to him. The Beraisa mentions a widow to teach that this is not so.</p>
<p class="bas indent2"><span class="nm">2.</span><span class="cl">Version #2 (Tosfos):</span> We might have thought that Esnan is Pasul only if such a Bi'ah forbids a woman to a Kohen due to Zonah. The Beraisa mentions a widow to teach that this is not so.</p>
<p class="bas indent1"><span class="nm">(d)</span><span class="cl">(Mishnah - Rebbi):</span> Similarly, if Reuven told Shimon "take this lamb... (and your Shifchah will sleep with my slave)"...</p>
<p class="bas indent1"><span class="nm">(e)</span><span class="cl">Question:</span> A Shifchah is permitted to a slave! (Why do Chachamim disqualify?)</p>
<p class="bas indent1"><span class="nm">(f)</span><span class="cl">Answer #1 (Rav Huna):</span> Reuven means 'she will have relations with <i>me</i>.' "Slave" is a euphemism.</p>
<p class="bas indent1"><span class="nm">(g)</span><span class="cl">Objection:</span> If so, why does Rebbi permit it?</p>
<p class="bas indent1"><span class="nm">(h)</span><span class="cl">Answer #2 (Shmuel bar R. Yitzchak):</span> She will have relations with Reuven's Eved Ivri;</p>
<p class="bas indent1"><span class="nm">(i)</span><span class="cl">Question:</span> A Shifchah is permitted to an Eved Ivri!</p>
<p class="bas indent1"><span class="nm">(j)</span><span class="cl">Answer:</span> The case is, the Eved does not have a wife and children;</p>
<p class="bas indent2"><span class="nm">1.</span><span class="cl">(Beraisa):</span> A master may give a Shifchah to his Eved Ivri (to have relations with her) only if the Eved has a wife and children. (Bartenura - Rebbi is Machshir because he permits a Shifchah even to an unmarried Eved Ivri. Alternatively, since the Isur of Shifchah was (in general) permitted to an Eved Ivri, even when it is not permitted, what is paid is not considered Esnan Zonah.)</p>
<p class="bas subject"><span class="nm">2)</span><i>MECHIR KELEV</i></p>
<p class="bas indent1"><span class="nm">(a)</span><span class="cl">(Mishnah) Question:</span> What is the case of Mechir Kelev (something traded for a dog)?</p>
<p class="bas indent1"><span class="nm">(b)</span><span class="cl">Answer:</span> Reuven told Shimon "take this lamb in exchange for this dog." (The lamb is Pasul for a Korban.)</p>
<p class="bas indent1"><span class="nm">(c)</span>Similarly, if partners divided, and Levi took 10 sheep and Yehudah took nine sheep and a dog, Levi's sheep are all Pesulim, and Yehudah's sheep are Kesherim.</p>
<p class="bas indent1"><span class="nm">(d)</span>Esnan of a dog (Ploni gave a lamb to the dog's owner in exchange for sleeping with the dog) and Mechir Zonah (a lamb traded for a Shifchah, whom he buys for a Zonah) are Kesherim;</p>
<p class="bas indent2"><span class="nm">1.</span>"Sheneihem" teaches that two of them (Esnan Zonah and Mechir Kelev) are Pesulim, but not four. (Esnan Kelev and Mechir Zonah are Kesherim.)</p>
<p class="bas indent1"><span class="nm">(e)</span>Offspring of Esnan Zonah and Mechir Kelev are Kesherim. "Hen (they)" are Pesulim, but their offspring are not.</p>
<p class="bas indent1"><span class="nm">(f)</span><span class="cl">(Gemara - Beraisa):</span> Mechir Kelev is Chalifas (something traded for a) dog - "Timkor Amcha... v'Lo Ribis bi'Mechireihem." ("Mechir" is spelled with a "Ches," which is <i>not</i> interchangeable with "Chaf," therefore the Gemara needed to show that it refers to a sale. We explain according to the Gra's text of Rashi.)</p>
<p class="bas indent1"><span class="nm">(g)</span><span class="cl">Suggestion:</span> Perhaps ("Esnan" also applies to Kelev, i.e.) the Torah forbids (Esnan Zonah, and) the Esnan <i>and</i> Mechir of a Kelev!</p>
<p class="bas indent1"><span class="nm">(h)</span><span class="cl">Rejection:</span> "Sheneihem" are Pesulim, but not three.</p>
<p class="bas indent1"><span class="nm">(i)</span><span class="cl">Suggestion:</span> We meant that perhaps Mechir Kelev is (just) Esnan Kelev!</p>
<p class="bas indent1"><span class="nm">(j)</span><span class="cl">Answer:</span> If so, the verse should have said "Esnan Zonah v'Kelev";</p>
<p class="bas indent2"><span class="nm">1.</span>Rather, it says "Esnan Zonah u'Mechir Kelev" to teach that Mechir is Chalifas.</p>
<p class="bas indent1"><span class="nm">(k)</span><span class="cl">(Mishnah):</span> Similarly, if partners divided...</p>
<p class="bas indent1"><span class="nm">(l)</span><span class="cl">Question:</span> We should be able to pick one of Levi's sheep to be in exchange for the dog, and the rest will be Kesherim!</p>
<p class="bas indent1"><span class="nm">(m)</span><span class="cl">Answer:</span> The case is, the dog is worth more than one of Levi's sheep. Each of Levi's sheep is worth slightly more than each of Yehudah's;</p>
<p class="bas indent2"><span class="nm">1.</span>In all, the nine sheep of Levi that correspond to Yehudah's nine, they compensate for the extra value of the dog. Each is partially in exchange for the dog.</p>
<p class="bas indent1"><span class="nm">(n)</span><span class="cl">(Mishnah):</span> Esnan Kelev and Mechir Zonah are Kesherim.</p>
<p class="bas indent1"><span class="nm">(o)</span><span class="cl">Question (Rava of Parzakiya):</span> What is the source that Zenus does not apply to a dog? (If a man paid to sleep with a dog (Rashi; Tosfos - he paid a Zonah to sleep with his dog), the Esnan is valid.)</p>
<p class="bas bbbline">30b----------------------------------------30b</p>
<p class="bas indent1"><span class="nm">(p)</span><span class="cl">Answer (Rav Ashi):</span> If it applied, the Torah would have disqualified "Esnan Zonah v'Kelev."</p>
<p class="bas indent1"><span class="nm">(q)</span><span class="cl">Support (Beraisa) Question:</span> What is the source that Esnan Kelev and Mechir Zonah are Kesherim?</p>
<p class="bas indent2"><span class="nm">1.</span><span class="cl">Answer:</span> The Torah disqualifies two (Esnan Zonah and Mechir Kelev), but not four.</p>
<p class="bas indent2"><span class="nm">2.</span>Offspring of Esnan Zonah and Mechir Kelev are Kesherim. "Gam Sheneihem" are Pesulim, but their offspring are not.</p>
<p class="bas indent1"><span class="nm">(r)</span><span class="cl">(Rava):</span> The Vlad of a Nirva or Noge'ach is Pasul for a Korban (if it was pregnant at the time), for also the fetus was party to the bestiality or goring.</p>
<p class="bas indent2"><span class="nm">1.</span><span class="cl">Version #1:</span> The Vlad of a Muktzeh or Ne'evad is valid for a Korban. Only the mother was designated or worshipped.</p>
<p class="bas indent2"><span class="nm">2.</span><span class="cl">Version #2:</span> The Vlad of a Muktzeh or Ne'evad is Pasul for a Korban. The idolaters appreciate the increased volume due to the fetus.</p>
<p class="bas indent1"><span class="nm">(s)</span><span class="cl">(Rav Achdevoy):</span> If a man was Mekadesh a woman with Peresh (intestinal fluids) of a Shor ha'Niskal (an ox sentenced to be stoned), she is Mekudeshes. If he was Mekadesh with Peresh of a calf offered to idolatry, she is not Mekudeshes. We can learn from reasoning or verses:</p>
<p class="bas indent2"><span class="nm">1.</span>Reasoning - those who offer calves to idolatry prefer a fatter sacrifice. It is important, therefore it is forbidden like the calf;</p>
<p class="bas indent3"><span class="nm">i.</span>Peresh of Shor ha'Niskal has no value, so it is not forbidden with the ox.</p>
<p class="bas indent2"><span class="nm">2.</span>Verses - regarding idolatry, it says "v'Lo Yidbak b'Yadcha Me'umah Min ha'Cherem" (even the Peresh);</p>
<p class="bas indent2"><span class="nm">3.</span>Regarding Shor ha'Niskal, it says "v'Lo Ye'achel Es Besaro" - the meat is forbidden, but not the Peresh.</p>
<p class="bas subject"><span class="nm">3)</span>WHAT BECOMES FORBIDDEN?</p>
<p class="bas indent1"><span class="nm">(a)</span><span class="cl">(Mishnah):</span> If money was given for an Esnan, it is valid (to buy Korbanos);</p>
<p class="bas indent1"><span class="nm">(b)</span>If wine, oil, Soles or anything offered on the Mizbe'ach was given, it is Pasul.</p>
<p class="bas indent1"><span class="nm">(c)</span>If (animal) Korbanos were given, they are Kesherim. If birds were given, they are Pesulim.</p>
<p class="bas indent2"><span class="nm">1.</span><span class="cl">Suggestion:</span> A Kal va'Chomer should permit birds! A Mum invalidates a Korban, yet the Pesulim of Esnan and Mechir do not apply to it. A Mum does not invalidate a bird, so all the more so Esnan and Mechir should not invalidate it!</p>
<p class="bas indent2"><span class="nm">2.</span><span class="cl">Rejection:</span> "L'Chol Neder" includes birds. (Esnan and Mechir apply to them.)</p>
<p class="bas indent1"><span class="nm">(d)</span>The offspring of any animal invalid for a Korban is Kosher for a Korban;</p>
<p class="bas indent1"><span class="nm">(e)</span>R. Eliezer says, offspring of a Tereifah may not be offered.</p>
<p class="bas indent1"><span class="nm">(f)</span>R. Chanina ben Antigionus says, if a Kosher calf nursed from a Tereifah, it may not be offered (Rambam - that day).</p>
<p class="bas indent1"><span class="nm">(g)</span>If any Kodshim became Tereifah, it may not be redeemed, for (it is forbidden to Yisrael, and) we may not redeem Kodshim to feed them to dogs.</p>
<p class="bas indent1"><span class="nm">(h)</span><span class="cl">(Gemara - Beraisa #1):</span> If a Zonah received wheat, olives or grapes, and she made them into flour, oil or wine, they may not be offered;</p>
<p class="bas indent1"><span class="nm">(i)</span><span class="cl">Contradiction (Beraisa #2):</span> They may be offered.</p>
<p class="bas indent1"><span class="nm">(j)</span><span class="cl">Resolution (Rav Yosef - Beraisa #3):</span> Beis Shamai forbids, and Beis Hillel permits. (Beraisa #1 is like Beis Shamai, Beraisa #2 is like Beis Hillel);</p>
<p class="bas indent2"><span class="nm">1.</span>Beis Hillel expounds "Hem" (they are forbidden), but not their offspring, and not Shinuyeihem (what they are transformed into);</p>
<p class="bas indent2"><span class="nm">2.</span>Beis Shamai expounds "Hem," but not their offspring. "Gam" includes Shinuyeihem.</p>
<p class="bas indent2"><span class="nm">3.</span><span class="cl">Question:</span> What do Beis Hillel learn from "Gam"?</p>
<p class="bas indent2"><span class="nm">4.</span>This is left difficult.</p>
<p class="bas indent1"><span class="nm">(k)</span><span class="cl">(Beraisa - R. Elazar):</span> "Beis Hash-m Elokecha" excludes Parah Adumah. (It is not offered in the Mikdash, therefore an Esnan is Kosher for it);</p>
<p class="bas indent1"><span class="nm">(l)</span>Chachamim say, this comes to include gold plating for the Heichal. (An Esnan may not be used for it.)</p>
<p class="bas indent1"><span class="nm">(m)</span><span class="cl">Question:</span> Who are these Chachamim?</p>
<p class="bas indent1"><span class="nm">(n)</span><span class="cl">Answer (Rav Chisda):</span> They hold like R. Yosi bar Yehudah:</p>
<p class="bas indent2"><span class="nm">1.</span><span class="cl">(R. Yosi bar Yehudah):</span> If gold was given for an Esnan, it may not be used to plate even the back of the Heichal.</p>
<p class="bas indent1"><span class="nm">(o)</span><span class="cl">(Mishnah):</span> If Korbanos were given, they are Kesherim.</p>
<p class="bas indent1"><span class="nm">(p)</span><span class="cl">(Beraisa) Suggestion:</span> A Kal va'Chomer should teach that (the Pesulim of) Esnan and Mechir take effect on Kodshim!</p>
<p class="bas indent2"><span class="nm">1.</span>A Mum does not invalidate a bird, yet Esnan and Mechir invalidate it. A Mum invalidates a Korban, all the more so Esnan and Mechir should invalidate it!</p>
<p class="bas indent1"><span class="nm">(q)</span><span class="cl">Rejection:</span> "L'Chol Neder" excludes something already Nadur (made Hekdesh, i.e. Kodshim).</p>

<p class="bas indent1"><span class="nm">(t)</span><span class="cl">Answer (R. Hoshaya):</span> The Beraisa discusses Korban Pesach. It is like Rebbi;</p>
<p class="bas indent2"><span class="nm">1.</span><span class="cl">(Beraisa):</span> "V'Im Yim'at ha'Bayis mi'Heyos mi'Seh" - (if the household is lacking,) sustain it through the Seh (sell shares of the Korban Pesach). One may do so to get money for food, but not for Mekach (Rashi - business; R. Gershom - clothing);</p>
<p class="bas indent2"><span class="nm">2.</span>Rebbi permits selling shares of the Pesach or Chagigah (Shelamim) even to get money for Mekach, and the money is Chulin. Yisraelim are Makdish their Korbanos with this intent.</p>
