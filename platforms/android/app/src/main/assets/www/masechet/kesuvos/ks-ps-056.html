<p class="dedicationbox">KESUVOS 56 - Two weeks of study material have been dedicated by Mrs. Estanne Abraham Fawer to honor the Yahrzeit of her father, Rav Mordechai ben Eliezer Zvi (Rabbi Morton Weiner) Z'L, who passed away on 18 Teves 5760. May the merit of supporting and advancing Dafyomi study -- which was so important to him -- during the weeks of his Yahrzeit serve as an Iluy for his Neshamah. </p>

<div class="subject"><span class="nm">1)</span><p>THE FINAL RULING</p></div>
<div class="indent1"><span class="nm">(a)</span><p><span class="cl">Answer:</span> Rather, both Rav and R. Nasan follow estimation. We understand the one who said that the Halachah follows R. Elazar ben Azaryah;</p></div>
<div class="indent2"><span class="nm">1.</span><p>The other says that the Halachah does not follow him because here, we assess that he gave Tosefes due to the feeling of closeness, which already came (before Nisu'in).</p></div>
<div class="indent1"><span class="nm">(b)</span><p><span class="cl">(Rav Chanina):</span> The Halachah follows R. Elazar (ben Azaryah).</p></div>
<div class="indent1"><span class="nm">(c)</span><p><span class="cl">R. Yanai:</span> Do not teach this in the Beis Medrash! The Halachah follows Chachamim.</p></div>
<div class="indent1"><span class="nm">(d)</span><p><span class="cl">(Rav Yitzchak bar Avdimi):</span> The Halachah follows R. Elazar.</p></div>
<div class="indent1"><span class="nm">(e)</span><p><span class="cl">(Rav Nachman citing Shmuel):</span> The Halachah follows R. Elazar.</p></div>
<div class="indent2"><span class="nm">1.</span><p><span class="cl">(Rav Nachman himself):</span> The Halachah does not follow R. Elazar.</p></div>
<div class="indent1"><span class="nm">(f)</span><p><span class="cl">Chachamim of Neharda'a:</span> Rav Nachman says, the Halachah follows R. Elazar;</p></div>
<div class="indent1"><span class="nm">(g)</span><p>Even though Rav Nachman cursed any judge who will rule like R. Elazar, the Halachah follows R. Elazar.</p></div>
<div class="indent1"><span class="nm">(h)</span><p>In practice, the Halachah follows R. Elazar.</p></div>
<div class="subject"><span class="nm">2)</span><p>WHEN IS THE ADDITION TO THE KESUVAH ACQUIRED?</p></div>
<div class="indent1"><span class="nm">(a)</span><p><span class="cl">Question (Ravin):</span> If there was Chupah but no Bi'ah, does she receive the Tosefes?</p></div>
<div class="indent2"><span class="nm">1.</span><p>Does the dearness of Chupah acquire?</p></div>
<div class="indent2"><span class="nm">2.</span><p>Or, does the dearness of Bi'ah acquire?</p></div>
<div class="indent1"><span class="nm">(b)</span><p><span class="cl">Answer (Rav Yosef's Beraisa):</span> He wrote the Tosefes only for the dearness of the first night.</p></div>
<div class="indent2"><span class="nm">1.</span><p>Granted, if the dearness of Chupah acquires, this is only the first night.</p></div>
<div class="indent2"><span class="nm">2.</span><p><span class="cl">Question:</span> If the dearness of Bi'ah acquires, this is not only the first night!</p></div>
<div class="indent1"><span class="nm">(c)</span><p><span class="cl">Question:</span> (You learn from here that the dearness of Chupah acquires.) Chupah is not only at night!</p></div>
<div class="indent2"><span class="nm">1.</span><p><span class="cl">Counter-question:</span> Do you say that Bi'ah is only at night?!</p></div>
<div class="indent3"><span class="nm">i.</span><p><span class="cl">(Rava):</span> One may have Bi'ah during the day in a dark house.</p></div>
<div class="indent2"><span class="nm">2.</span><p><span class="cl">Answer:</span> The Beraisa teaches that it is normal to have Bi'ah only at night.</p></div>
<div class="indent1"><span class="nm">(d)</span><p><span class="cl">Answer:</span> Since Chupah is for Bi'ah, it is normal to do it at night.</p></div>
<div class="indent1"><span class="nm">(e)</span><p><span class="cl">Question (Rav Ashi):</span> If she entered Chupah and became Nidah, what is the law?</p></div>
<div class="indent2"><span class="nm">1.</span><p>If the dearness of Chupah acquires, is this only a Chupah fitting for Bi'ah?</p></div>
<div class="indent2"><span class="nm">2.</span><p>Or, perhaps we do not distinguish!</p></div>
<div class="indent1"><span class="nm">(f)</span><p>The question is unsettled.</p></div>
<div class="subject"><span class="nm">3)</span><p>WRITING A RECEIPT</p></div>
<div class="indent1"><span class="nm">(a)</span><p><span class="cl">(Mishnah - R. Yehudah):</span> He may write to a virgin... (and she writes that she received half).</p></div>
<div class="indent1"><span class="nm">(b)</span><p><span class="cl">Question:</span> R. Yehudah holds that we do not write receipts!</p></div>
<div class="indent2"><span class="nm">1.</span><p><span class="cl">(Mishnah - R. Yehudah):</span> If one paid part of his debt, we destroy the first document and write a new one for the remaining debt;</p></div>
<div class="indent2"><span class="nm">2.</span><p>R. Yosi says, we write a receipt.</p></div>
<div class="indent1"><span class="nm">(c)</span><p><span class="cl">Answer #1 (R. Yirmiyah):</span> The receipt is written in the Kesuvah itself (so there is no concern lest he lose the receipt and she will collect the entire amount).</p></div>
<div class="indent1"><span class="nm">(d)</span><p><span class="cl">Answer #2 (Abaye):</span> The receipt need not be written in the Kesuvah itself!</p></div>
<div class="indent2"><span class="nm">1.</span><p>Regarding a borrower who paid; if he takes a receipt he might lose it and have to pay again;</p></div>
<div class="indent2"><span class="nm">2.</span><p>Here, the husband did not pay anything. She merely <i>said</i> that she received part. If he guards the receipt, fine; if not, he caused his own loss!</p></div>
<div class="indent1"><span class="nm">(e)</span><p><span class="cl">Question:</span> Granted, Abaye did not answer like R. Yirmiyah because the Mishnah does not say that the receipt is in the Kesuvah;</p></div>
<div class="indent2"><span class="nm">1.</span><p>Why didn't R. Yirmiyah learn like Abaye?</p></div>
<div class="indent1"><span class="nm">(f)</span><p><span class="cl">Answer:</span> We decree not to write a receipt here lest people do so regarding a loan.</p></div>
<div class="subject"><span class="nm">4)</span><p>STIPULATIONS CONTRARY TO TORAH</p></div>
<div class="indent1"><span class="nm">(a)</span><p>R. Yehudah implies that she must write that she received 100. It is not enough for her to say so.</p></div>
<div class="indent1"><span class="nm">(b)</span><p><span class="cl">Question:</span> This is a monetary matter, and R. Yehudah holds that such stipulations work!</p></div>
<div class="indent2"><span class="nm">1.</span><p><span class="cl">(Beraisa - R. Meir):</span> If a man was Mekadesh a woman on condition that he is exempt from giving to her food, clothing or Onah (the proper frequency of Bi'ah), the Kidushin takes effect and his stipulation is void;</p></div>
<div class="indent2"><span class="nm">2.</span><p>R. Yehudah says, in monetary matters the stipulation is valid.</p></div>
<div class="indent1"><span class="nm">(c)</span><p><span class="cl">Answer:</span> R. Yehudah holds that Kesuvah is an enactment mid'Rabanan, and Chachamim strengthened their words more than Torah laws.</p></div>
<div class="indent1"><span class="nm">(d)</span><p><span class="cl">Question:</span> An enactment mid'Rabanan allows a husband to eat the Peiros of his wife's land, yet this was not strengthened!</p></div>
<div class="indent2"><span class="nm">1.</span><p><span class="cl">(Mishnah - R. Yehudah):</span> A man may always eat the Peiros of his wife's land unless he writes that he has no rights to her property, its Peiros, and the Peiros of its Peiros ad infinitum.</p></div>
<div class="bbbline">56b----------------------------------------56b</p></div>
<div class="indent2"><span class="nm">2.</span><p>We hold that here, 'writes' really means 'says'.</p></div>
<div class="indent1"><span class="nm">(e)</span><p><span class="cl">Answer (Abaye):</span> All wives have a Kesuvah, but not all have Peiros; Chachamim strengthened their enactment regarding Kesuvah, which is common, but not regarding Peiros, which are uncommon.</p></div>
<div class="indent1"><span class="nm">(f)</span><p><span class="cl">Question:</span> Merchants are common, yet (R. Yehudah holds that) Chachamim did not strengthen their enactment (of Demai, to suspect that merchants scheme to lie for each other)!</p></div>
<div class="indent2"><span class="nm">1.</span><p><span class="cl">(Mishnah):</span> If two merchants entered a city, and one said 'My produce is Chadash (new), and my friend's is old. Mine is untithed, and my friend's is tithed', they are not believed;</p></div>
<div class="indent2"><span class="nm">2.</span><p>R. Yehudah says, they are believed.</p></div>
<div class="indent1"><span class="nm">(g)</span><p><span class="cl">Answer #1 (Abaye):</span> A Vadai enactment mid'Rabanan was strengthened, but not one that is based on Safek.</p></div>
<div class="indent1"><span class="nm">(h)</span><p><span class="cl">Answer #2 (Rava):</span> Chachamim were lenient about Demai (because most Amei ha'Aretz tithe).</p></div>
<div class="subject"><span class="nm">5)</span><p>STIPULATIONS TO REDUCE THE KESUVAH</p></div>
<div class="indent1"><span class="nm">(a)</span><p><span class="cl">(Mishnah - R. Meir):</span> Anyone who reduces the Kesuvah from 200...</p></div>
<div class="indent1"><span class="nm">(b)</span><p><span class="cl">Inference:</span> <i>Anyone</i> connotes that even if he stipulated, the stipulation is void and the Kesuvah really is 200, but since she thinks that it is not 200, the Bi'ah is Znus.</p></div>
<div class="indent1"><span class="nm">(c)</span><p><span class="cl">Question:</span> R. Meir holds that a stipulation contrary to <i>Torah</i> is void. This implies that a stipulation contrary to a mid'Rabanan law is valid!</p></div>
<div class="indent1"><span class="nm">(d)</span><p><span class="cl">Answer:</span> R. Meir holds that the Kesuvah is mid'Oraisa.</p></div>
<div class="indent1"><span class="nm">(e)</span><p><span class="cl">(Beraisa - R. Meir):</span> If anyone reduces the Kesuvah of a virgin from 200, or of a non-virgin from 100, the Bi'ah is Znus;</p></div>
<div class="indent1"><span class="nm">(f)</span><p>R. Yosi says, he is permitted;</p></div>
<div class="indent1"><span class="nm">(g)</span><p>R. Yehudah says, he may write 200 to a virgin or 100 to a non-virgin, and she writes that she received half.</p></div>
<div class="indent1"><span class="nm">(h)</span><p><span class="cl">Question:</span> R. Yosi forbids!</p></div>
<div class="indent2"><span class="nm">1.</span><p><span class="cl">Contradiction (Beraisa):</span> We do not designate Metaltelim (to be the sole source of payment) for a Kesuvah. This is an enactment to fix matters.</p></div>
<div class="indent2"><span class="nm">2.</span><p><span class="cl">Objection (R. Yosi):</span> How does this fix things? Their value is not fixed, and they depreciate!</p></div>
<div class="indent3"><span class="nm">i.</span><p><span class="cl">Question:</span> Also the first Tana does not allow designating Metaltelim!</p></div>
<div class="indent3"><span class="nm">ii.</span><p><span class="cl">Answer:</span> Rather, the first Tana distinguishes: Metaltelim may be used only if he accepted Acharayos (responsibility to pay from other property if they will be lost);</p></div>
<div class="indent3"><span class="nm">iii.</span><p>R. Yosi forbids even if he accepted Acharayos. Their value is not fixed, and they depreciate!</p></div>
<div class="indent2"><span class="nm">3.</span><p><span class="cl">Summation of contradiction:</span> R. Yosi is concerned lest they depreciate. All the more so he forbids stipulating to definitely decrease the Kesuvah!</p></div>
<div class="indent1"><span class="nm">(i)</span><p><span class="cl">Answer:</span> This is not difficult! She does not know that Metaltelim will depreciate, and does not intend to pardon the loss. Here, she knowingly pardoned the decrease!</p></div>
