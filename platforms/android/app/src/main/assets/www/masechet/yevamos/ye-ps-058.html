<div class="subject"><span class="nm">1)</span><p>CHUPAH OF PESULOS</p></div>
<div class="indent1"><span class="nm">(a)</span><p><span class="cl">(Rami bar Chama):</span> Yesh Chupah l'Pesulos depends on the dispute between R. Meir and R. Elazar and R. Shimon:</p></div>
<div class="indent2"><span class="nm">1.</span><p>R. Meir holds that Kidushin disqualifies, so also Chupah disqualifies;</p></div>
<div class="indent2"><span class="nm">2.</span><p>R. Elazar and R. Shimon hold that Kidushin does not disqualify, so neither does Chupah.</p></div>
<div class="indent1"><span class="nm">(b)</span><p><span class="cl">Objection:</span> This is not necessarily true!</p></div>
<div class="indent2"><span class="nm">1.</span><p>Perhaps R. Meir says that Kidushin disqualifies, since it acquires. Chupah does not acquire!</p></div>
<div class="indent2"><span class="nm">2.</span><p>Perhaps R. Elazar and R. Shimon say that Kidushin does not disqualify because it is not close to Bi'ah. Chupah is close to Bi'ah, so it disqualifies!</p></div>
<div class="indent1"><span class="nm">(c)</span><p>Rather, the following Tana'im argue about this.</p></div>
<div class="indent1"><span class="nm">(d)</span><p><span class="cl">(Beraisa):</span> If a woman married (a Kohen), whether she is Kosher or Pasul (to Kehunah), or if she had Chupah without Bi'ah, she is fed by her husband and she may eat Terumah.</p></div>
<div class="indent2"><span class="nm">1.</span><p><span class="cl">Question:</span> 'She had Chupah (without Bi'ah)' implies that (the Reisha,) 'she was married' means with Bi'ah. (However, this cannot be, for then she could not eat Terumah!)</p></div>
<div class="indent2"><span class="nm">2.</span><p><span class="cl">Answer:</span> The Seifa explains the Reisha, that 'She was married' means Chupah without Bi'ah, and she eats Terumah;</p></div>
<div class="indent2"><span class="nm">3.</span><p>R. Yishmael, the son of R. Yochanan ben Berokah says, Chupah permits a girl to eat Terumah only if Bi'ah permits her to eat Terumah.</p></div>
<div class="indent1"><span class="nm">(e)</span><p><span class="cl">Objection:</span> Perhaps they do not argue about Yesh Chupah l'Pesulos!</p></div>
<div class="indent2"><span class="nm">1.</span><p><span class="cl">Suggestion:</span> Perhaps R. Yishmael holds like R. Meir, that she does not eat during Kidushin.</p></div>
<div class="indent2"><span class="nm">2.</span><p><span class="cl">Objection:</span> If so, why does he say that Chupah permits a girl to eat only if Bi'ah permits her? He should say that (Kidushin) money permits a girl only if Bi'ah permits her!</p></div>
<div class="indent2"><span class="nm">3.</span><p><span class="cl">Answer:</span> Since the first Tana discussed Chupah, also R. Yishmael did.</p></div>
<div class="indent1"><span class="nm">(f)</span><p><span class="cl">(Rav Amram):</span> Rav Sheshes taught that Yesh Chupah l'Pesulos, and a Mishnah supports this.</p></div>
<div class="indent2"><span class="nm">1.</span><p><span class="cl">(Mishnah):</span> (A Sotah answers) "Amen", that I was not Mezaneh when Mekudeshes, married, Shomeres Yavam (when awaiting Yibum), or after Yibum.</p></div>
<div class="indent2"><span class="nm">2.</span><p><span class="cl">Question:</span> What is the case of Mekudeshes?</p></div>
<div class="indent2"><span class="nm">3.</span><p><span class="cl">Answer #1:</span> He warned her and took her to drink during Eirusin.</p></div>
<div class="indent2"><span class="nm">4.</span><p><span class="cl">Rejection:</span> An Arusah does not drink!</p></div>
<div class="indent3"><span class="nm">i.</span><p><span class="cl">(Mishnah):</span> An Arusah or a Shomeres Yavam does not drink or receive her Kesuvah.</p></div>
<div class="indent2"><span class="nm">5.</span><p><span class="cl">Answer #2:</span> Rather, he warned her and she was secluded during Eirusin, and he took her to drink after Nisu'in.</p></div>
<div class="indent2"><span class="nm">6.</span><p><span class="cl">Rejection:</span> (It was forbidden to have Nisu'in with her after seclusion, so) the water would not test her!</p></div>
<div class="indent3"><span class="nm">i.</span><p><span class="cl">(Beraisa):</span> "The man will be clean from sin" - the water tests her only if her husband is clean from sin.</p></div>
<div class="indent2"><span class="nm">7.</span><p><span class="cl">Answer #3:</span> Rather, he warned her and she was secluded during Eirusin, and he had Chupah without Bi'ah. This teaches that Chupah takes effect on Pesulos.</p></div>
<div class="indent1"><span class="nm">(g)</span><p><span class="cl">Objection (Rava):</span> The Mishnah cannot be correct!</p></div>
<div class="indent2"><span class="nm">1.</span><p><span class="cl">(Beraisa):</span> "Other than your husband" - the water tests her only if her husband had Bi'ah with her before the adulterer.</p></div>
<div class="indent1"><span class="nm">(h)</span><p><span class="cl">Answer #1 (Rami bar Chama):</span> Her husband had Bi'ah with her in her father's house during Eirusin.</p></div>
<div class="indent1"><span class="nm">(i)</span><p><span class="cl">Objection:</span> The corresponding case of a Shomeres Yavam is when the Yavam had Bi'ah with her in her father-in-law's house (i.e. while awaiting Yibum). If so she is not called Shomeres Yavam. She is a full wife!</p></div>
<div class="bbbline">58b----------------------------------------58b</p></div>
<div class="indent2"><span class="nm">1.</span><p>Rav said that Bi'ah (without intent for Yibum) acquires in all respects; Shmuel said that it acquires only for what is written in the Parashah.</p></div>
<div class="indent2"><span class="nm">2.</span><p>This Mishnah was brought to support Rav. He cannot explain why it calls her Shomeres Yavam!</p></div>
<div class="indent1"><span class="nm">(j)</span><p><span class="cl">Answer #2:</span> The case is, he gave her a Ma'amar. The Mishnah is like Beis Shamai, who say that a Ma'amar fully acquires. (It makes her an Arusah, so Bi'ah does not automatically make her a Nesu'ah.)</p></div>
<div class="indent2"><span class="nm">1.</span><p><span class="cl">Question:</span> If so, that is the same as Arusah! (The Mishnah listed them as separate cases.)</p></div>
<div class="indent3"><span class="nm">i.</span><p><span class="cl">Counter-question:</span> You must admit that 'Nesu'ah' and 'Kenusah (after Yibum)' are the same!</p></div>
<div class="indent3"><span class="nm">ii.</span><p><span class="cl">Answer:</span> You must say that 'married' refers to his own wife, and 'after Yibum' refers to his brother's wife;</p></div>
<div class="indent2"><span class="nm">2.</span><p><span class="cl">Answer:</span> Similarly, 'Arusah' refers to his own wife, and 'Shomeres Yavam' to his brother's wife.</p></div>
<div class="indent1"><span class="nm">(k)</span><p><span class="cl">Answer #3 (Rav Papa):</span> The Tana of our Mishnah is the Tana of the following Beraisa.</p></div>
<div class="indent2"><span class="nm">1.</span><p><span class="cl">(Beraisa):</span> We do not warn an Arusah in order to make her drink during Eirusin, but we warn her to make her drink after Nisu'in.</p></div>
<div class="indent1"><span class="nm">(l)</span><p><span class="cl">Answer #4 (Rav Nachman bar Yitzchak):</span> The oath (that she was not Mezaneh at any of these times) includes the period of Eirusin through Gilgul. (Once she must swear about the seclusion after Nisu'in, we make her swear also about during Eirusin.)</p></div>
<div class="subject"><span class="nm">2)</span><p>WHAT DISQUALIFIES A YEVAMAH FROM EATING</p></div>
<div class="indent1"><span class="nm">(a)</span><p><span class="cl">(R. Chanina citing R. Yochanan):</span> If Reuven gave a Ma'amar to his Yevamah, and he has a brother, even if he and she are Kohanim, he disqualifies her from Terumah. (She is like one awaiting forbidden Bi'ah, i.e. with Reuven's brother.)</p></div>
<div class="indent1"><span class="nm">(b)</span><p><span class="cl">Objection:</span> According to whom is this?</p></div>
<div class="indent2"><span class="nm">1.</span><p><span class="cl">Suggestion #1:</span> It is like R. Meir.</p></div>
<div class="indent2"><span class="nm">2.</span><p><span class="cl">Rejection:</span> R. Meir forbids a woman awaiting Bi'ah forbidden mid'Oraisa. We have no source when the Bi'ah is Asur mid'Rabanan!</p></div>
<div class="indent2"><span class="nm">3.</span><p><span class="cl">Suggestion #2:</span> It is like R. Elazar and R. Shimon.</p></div>
<div class="indent2"><span class="nm">4.</span><p><span class="cl">Rejection:</span> They permit a woman awaiting Bi'ah forbidden mid'Oraisa, and all the more so, if the Bi'ah is forbidden mid'Rabanan!</p></div>
<div class="indent1"><span class="nm">(c)</span><p><span class="cl">(Ravin):</span> Rather, if he gave to her a Ma'amar, all (R. Yochanan and Reish Lakish) permit her to eat. If he has a brother who is a Chalal, all forbid her to eat;</p></div>
<div class="indent2"><span class="nm">1.</span><p>They argue about when he gave to her a Get - R. Yochanan permits her to eat, and Reish Lakish forbids.</p></div>
<div class="indent2"><span class="nm">2.</span><p>R. Yochanan permits, for even R. Meir forbids only when she is forbidden mid'Oraisa. When the Isur is mid'Rabanan, even he permits!</p></div>
<div class="indent2"><span class="nm">3.</span><p>Reish Lakish forbids, for even R. Elazar and R. Shimon permit only when the husband can permit others to eat. Here, he cannot permit (a woman to whom he gave a Get) to eat!</p></div>
<div class="indent2"><span class="nm">4.</span><p><span class="cl">Question:</span> He permits a Bas Kohen (whom he divorced) to return to eat Terumah in her father's house!</p></div>
<div class="indent2"><span class="nm">5.</span><p><span class="cl">Answer:</span> That is because she is detached from him and close to her father. A Yevamah is tied to the Yavam!</p></div>
