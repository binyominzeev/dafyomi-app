<p class="bas indent1"><span class="nm">(a)</span><span class="cl">Support (Beraisa):</span> If one is saying Shema and his Rebbi or someone more important than he came:</p>
<p class="bas indent2"><span class="nm">1.</span>If it was between the Perakim, one greets him, we need not say that he responds;</p>
<p class="bas indent3"><span class="nm">i.</span>In it was in the middle, one greets him only if he fears him, we need not say that he responds;</p>
<p class="bas indent2"><span class="nm">2.</span>R. Yehudah says, in the middle one greets on account of fear and responds on account of honor;</p>
<p class="bas indent3"><span class="nm">i.</span>Between the Perakim, one greets on account of honor and responds to anyone.</p>
<p class="bas indent1"><span class="nm">(b)</span><span class="cl">Question (Achi):</span> May one interrupt Hallel or the Megilah reading [to greet someone]?</p>
<p class="bas indent2"><span class="nm">1.</span>We may interrupt during Keri'as Shema, which is mid'Oraisa, all the more so we may interrupt these, which are mid'Rabanan;</p>
<p class="bas indent2"><span class="nm">2.</span>Or, perhaps these are more stringent, for they publicize miracles that Hash-m did for Yisrael!</p>
<p class="bas indent1"><span class="nm">(c)</span><span class="cl">Answer (R. Chiya):</span> One may interrupt.</p>
<p class="bas indent1"><span class="nm">(d)</span><span class="cl">(Rabah):</span> On days when an individual says the full Hallel, he may interrupt between Perakim, but not in the middle of a Perek;</p>
<p class="bas indent2"><span class="nm">1.</span>On days when an individual says the abridged Hallel, he may interrupt even in the middle of a Perek.</p>
<p class="bas indent1"><span class="nm">(e)</span><span class="cl">Question:</span> But Rav bar Sheva visited Ravina on a day when an individual says the abridged Hallel, and Ravina did not interrupt!</p>
<p class="bas indent1"><span class="nm">(f)</span><span class="cl">Answer:</span> That is because Ravina did not consider Rav bar Sheva so important that he must greet him.</p>
<p class="bas indent1"><span class="nm">(g)</span><span class="cl">Question (Ashi'an):</span> If one is fasting (Tosfos - a voluntary fast; Me'iri - even a Ta'anis Tzibur), may one taste [food, to see if it needs seasoning]?</p>
<p class="bas indent2"><span class="nm">1.</span>Perhaps he only accepted not to eat -- tasting is not considered eating (Tosfos - but he must spit it out);</p>
<p class="bas indent2"><span class="nm">2.</span>Or, perhaps he forbid himself to benefit from food, and tasting is benefit!</p>
<p class="bas indent1"><span class="nm">(h)</span><span class="cl">Answer (R. Ami):</span> He may taste.</p>
<p class="bas indent1"><span class="nm">(i)</span><span class="cl">Support (Beraisa):</span> One who tastes does not bless; one who is fasting may taste.</p>
<p class="bas indent1"><span class="nm">(j)</span><span class="cl">Question:</span> Up to how much is considered tasting?</p>
<p class="bas indent1"><span class="nm">(k)</span><span class="cl">Answer:</span> R. Ami and R. Asi would taste up to a Revi'is.</p>
<p class="bas indent1"><span class="nm">(l)</span><span class="cl">(Rav):</span> If one greets a friend before praying, it is as if he made him a Bamah (on which to offer Korbanos, instead of the Mizbe'ach in the Mikdash) -- "Chidlu Lachem Min ha'Adam... <i>va'Meh</i> Nechshav" -- we read this "Bamah."</p>
<p class="bas indent1"><span class="nm">(m)</span><span class="cl">(Shmuel):</span> The verse asks rhetorically, "ba'Meh (how) can you regard a person in front of Hash-m?!"</p>
<p class="bas indent1"><span class="nm">(n)</span><span class="cl">Question (Rav Sheshes - Mishnah):</span> Between the Perakim, one greets on account of honor, and responds (even though this is before Shemoneh Esreh)!</p>
<p class="bas indent1"><span class="nm">(o)</span><span class="cl">Answer (R. Aba):</span> Rav and Shmuel discuss one who goes to his friend's house to greet him before praying.</p>
<p class="bas indent1"><span class="nm">(p)</span><span class="cl">(Rav Idi bar Avin):</span> It is forbidden to do your needs before prayer -- "Tzedek Lefanav Yehalech v'Yasem l'Derech Pe'amav."</p>
<p class="bas indent1"><span class="nm">(q)</span><span class="cl">(Rav Idi bar Avin):</span> If one embarks on his journey after praying, Hash-m will do his desires -- "Tzedek Lefanav Yehalech v'Yasem l'Derech Pe'amav."</p>
<p class="bas indent1"><span class="nm">(r)</span><span class="cl">(R. Yonah):</span> If one does not have a dream for seven days, he is called a Rasha -- "<i>v'Save'a</i> Yalin Bal Yipaked Ra" -- we read this "v'Sheva."</p>
<p class="bas indent1"><span class="nm">(s)</span><span class="cl">(Rav Acha citing R. Yochanan):</span> The verse teaches that one who satiates himself with Divrei Torah before Linah (sleeping) will not receive bad tidings.</p>
<p class="bas subject"><span class="nm">2)</span>VA'YOMER AND EMES V'YATZIV</p>
<p class="bas indent1"><span class="nm">(a)</span><span class="cl">(Mishnah):</span> The following are between the Perakim:</p>
<p class="bas indent1"><span class="nm">(b)</span><span class="cl">(R. Avahu):</span> The Halachah follows R. Yehudah, one may not interrupt between va'Yomer and Emes v'Yatziv.</p>
<p class="bas indent1"><span class="nm">(c)</span><span class="cl">(R. Avahu):</span> He learns from "v'Hashem Elokim Emes."</p>
<p class="bas bbbline">14b----------------------------------------14b</p>
<p class="bas indent1"><span class="nm">(d)</span><span class="cl">Question:</span> Does one say "Emes" twice, or only once?</p>
<p class="bas indent1"><span class="nm">(e)</span><span class="cl">Answer #1 (R. Avahu):</span> He says it twice.</p>
<p class="bas indent1"><span class="nm">(f)</span><span class="cl">Answer #2 (Rabah):</span> He says it once.</p>
<p class="bas indent1"><span class="nm">(g)</span>A man was leading the prayers in front of Rabah; Rabah heard him say "Emes" twice.</p>
<p class="bas indent1"><span class="nm">(h)</span><span class="cl">Rabah:</span> He was overcome by a craze that made him repeat "Emes."</p>
<p class="bas indent1"><span class="nm">(i)</span><span class="cl">Rav Yosef:</span> The following is a wonderful teaching!</p>
<p class="bas indent2"><span class="nm">1.</span><span class="cl">(Shmuel bar Yehudah):</span> In Eretz Yisrael, they say that in the evening one should say "Daber El Bnei Yisrael v'Amarta Aleihem," and then, "Ani Hash-m Elokeichem Emes,"</p>
<p class="bas indent1"><span class="nm">(j)</span><span class="cl">Abaye:</span> Why do you praise it? Rav Kahana taught that one should not begin (the third Parshah); if one began, he should finish it!</p>
<p class="bas indent2"><span class="nm">1.</span><span class="cl">Suggestion:</span> Perhaps saying "v'Amarta Aleihem" is not considered beginning the Parshah.</p>
<p class="bas indent2"><span class="nm">2.</span><span class="cl">Rejection:</span> R. Yitzchak taught that "Daber El Bnei Yisrael" is not considered beginning the Parshah, but "v'Amarta Aleihem" is!</p>
<p class="bas indent1"><span class="nm">(k)</span><span class="cl">(Rav Papa):</span> In Eretz Yisrael, they say that even "v'Amarta Aleihem" is not considered beginning it, until one says "v'Asu Lahem Tzitzis."</p>
<p class="bas indent1"><span class="nm">(l)</span><span class="cl">(Abaye):</span> Since they begin the Parshah in Eretz Yisrael, we (in Bavel) also begin it; since we consider "v'Amarta Aleihem" like beginning the Parshah, we finish it, as Rav Kahana taught.</p>
<p class="bas indent1"><span class="nm">(m)</span><span class="cl">(Chiya bar Rava):</span> If one said "Ani Hash-m Elokeichem," he must say Emes (v'Yatziv); if he did not say "Ani Hash-m Elokeichem," he need not say it.</p>
<p class="bas indent1"><span class="nm">(n)</span><span class="cl">Question:</span> But one must mention Yetzi'as Mitzrayim (which is in Emes v'Yatziv)!</p>
<p class="bas indent1"><span class="nm">(o)</span><span class="cl">Answer:</span> [One may thank Hash-m for Yetzi'as Mitzrayim without saying Emes v'Yatziv, such as] by saying, "Modim Anachnu Lach... she'Hotzeisanu me'Eretz Mitzrayim...."</p>
<p class="bas subject"><span class="nm">3)</span>THE ORDER OF THE <i>PARSHIYOS</i> OF SHEMA</p>
<p class="bas indent1"><span class="nm">(a)</span><span class="cl">(Mishnah - R. Yehoshua ben Korchah):</span> We say Shema before...</p>
<p class="bas indent1"><span class="nm">(b)</span><span class="cl">(Beraisa - R. Shimon):</span> It is proper that the paragraph Shema precedes v'Hayah Im Shamo'a, for Shema discusses learning, and v'Hayah Im Shamo'a discusses teaching;</p>
<p class="bas indent2"><span class="nm">1.</span>It is proper that v'Hayah Im Shamo'a precede va'Yomer, for v'Hayah Im Shamo'a discusses teaching, and va'Yomer discusses performing [the Mitzvos].</p>
<p class="bas indent1"><span class="nm">(c)</span><span class="cl">Objection:</span> #1: Shema discusses teaching and performing in addition to learning -- "v'Shinantam... u'Keshartam... u'Chesavtam"!</p>
<p class="bas indent1"><span class="nm">(d)</span><span class="cl">Objection #2:</span> "V'Hayah Im Shamo'a" discusses performing in addition to teaching -- "u'Keshartem... u'Chesavtem"!</p>
<p class="bas indent1"><span class="nm">(e)</span><span class="cl">Correction:</span> Rather, it is proper that Shema precedes v'Hayah Im Shamo'a, for Shema discusses learning, teaching and performing, and v'Hayah Im Shamo'a discusses only teaching and performing;</p>
<p class="bas indent2"><span class="nm">1.</span>It is proper that v'Hayah Im Shamo'a precede va'Yomer, for v'Hayah Im Shamo'a discusses teaching and performing, and va'Yomer discusses only performing.</p>
<p class="bas indent1"><span class="nm">(f)</span><span class="cl">Question:</span> R. Yehoshua ben Korchah's reason should suffice!</p>
<p class="bas indent1"><span class="nm">(g)</span><span class="cl">Answer:</span> Indeed, R. Shimon gives an additional reason:</p>
<p class="bas indent2"><span class="nm">1.</span>It is proper that Shema precedes v'Hayah Im Shamo'a, in order to accept Ol Malchus Shamayim before Ol Mitzvos; also, Shema discusses learning, teaching and performing, and v'Hayah discusses only teaching and performing.</p>
<p class="bas indent1"><span class="nm">(h)</span>Rav would wash his hands, say Keri'as Shema, put on Tefilin and then pray.</p>
<p class="bas indent1"><span class="nm">(i)</span><span class="cl">Question (Beraisa):</span> One who digs a burial cave for a Mes is exempt from Keri'as Shema, Tefilin, Tefilah and all other [positive] Mitzvos;</p>
<p class="bas indent2"><span class="nm">1.</span>When the time for Shema comes, he gets up, washes his hands, puts on Tefilin, says Keri'as Shema and prays.</p>
<p class="bas indent2"><span class="nm">2.</span><span class="cl">Objection:</span> The Reisha exempts from all Mitzvos, while the Seifa obligates him [in some]!</p>
<p class="bas indent2"><span class="nm">3.</span><span class="cl">Answer:</span> The Reisha discusses when he is alone, the Seifa is when there is someone else with him (when one digs, the other prays).</p>
<p class="bas indent2"><span class="nm">4.</span>In any case, this is unlike Rav (who would say Keri'as Shema before putting on Tefilin)!</p>
<p class="bas indent1"><span class="nm">(j)</span><span class="cl">Answer:</span> Rav holds like R. Yehoshua ben Korchah, who says that we accept Ol Malchus Shamayim (Shema) before Ol Mitzvos (Tefilin).</p>
<p class="bas indent1"><span class="nm">(k)</span><span class="cl">Objection #1:</span> R. Yehoshua ben Korchah only said this concerning the order of the Parshiyos, he did not say that reciting the Shema precedes <i> performing</i> Mitzvos!</p>
<p class="bas indent1"><span class="nm">(l)</span><span class="cl">Objection #2:</span> Rav does not hold like R. Yehoshua ben Korchah!</p>
<p class="bas indent2"><span class="nm">1.</span><span class="cl">(R. Chiya bar Ashi):</span> Many times I was in front of Rav, he would wash his hands, bless, teach, put on Tefilin, and say Keri'as Shema.</p>
<p class="bas indent2"><span class="nm">2.</span><span class="cl">Suggestion:</span> Perhaps he would put on Tefilin before Shema only if the time for Shema had not yet come.</p>
<p class="bas indent2"><span class="nm">3.</span><span class="cl">Objection:</span> If so, we would not learn anything from R. Chiya's testimony!</p>
<p class="bas indent1"><span class="nm">(m)</span><span class="cl">Answer:</span> He comes to argues with the opinion that we do not recite Birkas ha'Torah for Mishnah. (Ritva - really, it proves that a Berachah is needed for Midrash; the Gemara is not precise. Rashash - we used this teaching above (11b) to prove that Talmud requires Birkas ha'Torah - perhaps the text should say "Talmud" instead of Mishnah.)</p>
<p class="bas indent1"><span class="nm">(n)</span><span class="cl">Question:</span> In any case, there is a contradiction in Rav's practice!</p>
<p class="bas indent1"><span class="nm">(o)</span><span class="cl">Answer:</span> The messenger bringing Rav's Tefilin was late; so he was unable to put on Tefilin before saying Shema in the proper time.</p>
<p class="bas indent1"><span class="nm">(p)</span><span class="cl">(Ula):</span> Reciting Shema without Tefilin is like testifying "I am a liar" (he says in Shema that we must wear Tefilin, and he does not do so)!</p>
<p class="bas indent1"><span class="nm">(q)</span><span class="cl">(R. Chiya bar Aba):</span> It is as if he offered an Olah or Shelamim without the Minchah or Nesachim</p>
