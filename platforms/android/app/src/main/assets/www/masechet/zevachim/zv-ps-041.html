<div class="indent1"><span class="nm">(a)</span><p><span class="cl">Question:</span> We know the law of Se'ir Avodah Zarah only from a Hekesh (39b. "Ha'Chatas" refers to Se'ir Avodah Zarah.) Can this then teach another law through a Kal va'Chomer?! (Regarding Kodshim, we cannot learn from a Hekesh to something learned from a Hekesh - 49b.)</p></div>
<div class="indent1"><span class="nm">(b)</span><p><span class="cl">Answer (Rav Papa):</span> Indeed, R. Yishmael holds that something learned from a Hekesh can teach something else through a Kal va'Chomer.</p></div>
<div class="indent1"><span class="nm">(c)</span><p><span class="cl">(Beraisa):</span> "La'Par" refers to Par He'elem Davar.</p></div>
<div class="indent1"><span class="nm">(d)</span><p><span class="cl">Question:</span> The verse discusses Par He'elem Davar! (An extra word should be used to expound something else!)</p></div>
<div class="indent1"><span class="nm">(e)</span><p><span class="cl">Answer (Rav Papa):</span> We learn from Par He'elem Davar to Se'ir Avodah Zarah that Yoseres ha'Kaved (flesh that separates the liver from the lungs) and both kidneys are offered (with the Chelev);</p></div>
<div class="indent2"><span class="nm">1.</span><p>We learned this regarding Par He'elem Davar from a Hekesh to Par Mashu'ach. It cannot teach through another Hekesh;</p></div>
<div class="indent2"><span class="nm">2.</span><p>Therefore, it says "la'Par". It is as if Yoseres ha'Kaved and both kidneys are written regarding Par He'elem Davar itself.</p></div>
<div class="indent1"><span class="nm">(f)</span><p><span class="cl">Support (for Rav Papa - Beraisa) Question:</span> "V'Asah <i>la'Par</i> Ka'asher Asah" - what do we learn from this?</p></div>
<div class="indent2"><span class="nm">1.</span><p><span class="cl">Answer:</span> "V'Hem Hevi'u... <i>v'Chatasam</i>" teaches (that we offer the Eimurim of) Se'ir Avodah Zarah;</p></div>
<div class="indent2"><span class="nm">2.</span><p>"Shigegasam" refers to Par He'elem Davar;</p></div>
<div class="indent2"><span class="nm">3.</span><p>"Chatasam... Al Shigegasam" teaches that the law of Chatasam (Se'ir Avodah Zarah) is like Shigegasam (Par He'elem Davar).</p></div>
<div class="indent2"><span class="nm">4.</span><p><span class="cl">Question:</span> We learned Par He'elem Davar from a Hekesh to Par Mashu'ach. How can it teach through another Hekesh?!</p></div>
<div class="indent2"><span class="nm">5.</span><p>Answer "La'Par" is Par He'elem Davar. It is like 'la'Par", i.e. Par Mashu'ach. (It is as if the Eimurim were written regarding Par He'elem Davar itself).</p></div>
<div class="indent1"><span class="nm">(g)</span><p><span class="cl">(Beraisa):</span> "V'Chatasam" teaches (that we offer the Eimurim of) Se'ir Avodah Zarah.</p></div>
<div class="indent1"><span class="nm">(h)</span><p><span class="cl">Question:</span> Why don't we learn like above (39b), that "ha'Chatas" refers to Se'ir Avodah Zarah?</p></div>
<div class="indent1"><span class="nm">(i)</span><p><span class="cl">Answer (Rav Papa):</span> If that were the only source, we would only learn the Haza'os, for they are written regarding Par He'elem Davar. We would not learn Yoseres ha'Kaved and the kidneys, which are learned from a Hekesh to Par Mashu'ach;</p></div>

<div class="indent2"><span class="nm">1.</span><p>"V'Chatasam" teaches the Eimurim of Se'ir Avodah Zarah.</p></div>
<div class="indent1"><span class="nm">(j)</span><p><span class="cl">Question (against Rav Papa - Rav Huna brei d'Rav Noson):</span> The Tana learns everything about Par Yom Kipur from the Hekesh. Why do you say (40a) that we learn only Es, ba'Dam and v'Taval?</p></div>
<div class="indent1"><span class="nm">(k)</span><p><span class="cl">Answer (Rav Papa):</span> Tana'im argue about what we learn from the Hekesh. I discussed Tana d'Vei Rav (a Beraisa in Toras Kohanim). This Beraisa is like Tana d'Vei R. Yishmael;</p></div>
<div class="indent2"><span class="nm">1.</span><p><span class="cl">(Beraisa - Tana d'Vei R. Yishmael) Question:</span> Why does the Torah explicitly mention Yoseres ha'Kaved and the kidneys regarding Par Mashu'ach, but not regarding Par He'elem Davar?</p></div>
<div class="indent2"><span class="nm">2.</span><p><span class="cl">Answer:</span> A parable explains this. A king was angry at his close friend. Due to his love, he minimized (the record of) his friend's wrongdoing. (Rashi - the congregation of Yisrael sinned, so Hash-m discusses the Korban briefly; Maharsha - the Kohen Gadol sinned, so Hash-m describes the beauty of the Korban);</p></div>
<div class="indent2"><span class="nm">3.</span><p><span class="cl">(Beraisa - Tana d'Vei R. Yishmael) Question:</span> Regarding Par Mashu'ach it says "Paroches ha'Kodesh." Regarding Par He'elem Davar it is called only "Paroches". What is the reason?</p></div>
<div class="indent2"><span class="nm">4.</span><p><span class="cl">Answer:</span> A parable explains this. A province rebelled against the king:</p></div>
<div class="indent3"><span class="nm">i.</span><p>If the minority rebelled, his cabinet of confidants is intact;</p></div>
<div class="indent3"><span class="nm">ii.</span><p>If the majority rebelled, he does not retain his closeness with his confidants.</p></div>

<div class="indent1"><span class="nm">(a)</span><p><span class="cl">(Our Mishnah):</span> (Only one Matanah of an outer Korban is Me'akev according to Beis Hillel. Beis Shamai agree regarding Korbanos other than Chatas.) Therefore, if Zerikah was done properly...</p></div>
<div class="indent1"><span class="nm">(b)</span><p><span class="cl">(Mishnah - R. Meir):</span> If a Kohen was Mefagel in the Kometz (of a Minchah) but not the frankincense, or vice-versa, the Minchah is Pigul, and one (who eats it) is Chayav Kares;</p></div>
<div class="indent1"><span class="nm">(c)</span><p>Chachamim say, there is no Kares unless he was Mefagel in all the Matirim (things that permit it, in this case, the Kometz <i>and</i> frankincense).</p></div>
<div class="indent1"><span class="nm">(d)</span><p><span class="cl">(Reish Lakish):</span> R. Meir does not say that intent to be Mefagel in one of the Matirim makes Pigul. He agrees that one must be Mefagel in all the Matirim;</p></div>
<div class="indent2"><span class="nm">1.</span><p>The case is, the Kohen verbalized his intent (Chutz li'Zmano) in the Kometz, then offered the frankincense silently;</p></div>
<div class="indent2"><span class="nm">2.</span><p>R. Meir says that we assume that (unless he specifies otherwise,) he does all Avodos according to his initial intent.</p></div>
<div class="indent1"><span class="nm">(e)</span><p><span class="cl">Question:</span> What is Reish Lakish's source to say this?</p></div>
<div class="indent1"><span class="nm">(f)</span><p><span class="cl">Answer:</span> He derives this from our Mishnah.</p></div>
<div class="indent2"><span class="nm">1.</span><p><span class="cl">(Mishnah):</span> ...Therefore, if all the Zerikos were done k'Tiknan (like required) and one was done Lo k'Tiknan, it is Pasul, and there is no Kares;</p></div>
<div class="indent2"><span class="nm">2.</span><p><span class="cl">Inference:</span> If the first Zerikah was done Lo k'Tiknan and the rest were done k'Tiknan, it is Pigul.</p></div>
<div class="indent2"><span class="nm">3.</span><p><span class="cl">Question:</span> Who is the Tana of the Mishnah?</p></div>
<div class="indent3"><span class="nm">i.</span><p>It cannot be Chachamim. They say that Kares applies only if he was Mefagel in all the Matirim!</p></div>
<div class="indent2"><span class="nm">4.</span><p><span class="cl">Answer #1:</span> The Mishnah must be R. Meir.</p></div>
<div class="indent2"><span class="nm">5.</span><p><span class="cl">Suggestion:</span> If R. Meir held that intent to be Mefagel in one of the Matirim makes Pigul, he would Mechayev Kares also in the case of the Mishnah (when the last Avodah was Lo k'Tiknan)!</p></div>
<div class="indent2"><span class="nm">6.</span><p><span class="cl">Conclusion:</span> R. Meir holds that all Avodos are done like the initial intent.</p></div>
<div class="indent1"><span class="nm">(g)</span><p><span class="cl">Rejection #1 (and Answer #2 to Question 3 - Rav Shmuel bar Yitzchak):</span> Really, the Mishnah is Chachamim;</p></div>
<div class="indent2"><span class="nm">1.</span><p>'K'Tiknan' means in the way required to make Pigul, i.e. with intent Chutz li'Zmano.</p></div>
<div class="indent1"><span class="nm">(h)</span><p><span class="cl">Objection (Mishnah):</span> ...Therefore, if all the Zerikos were done k'Tiknan and one was done Lo k'Tiknan, it is Pasul, and there is no Kares;</p></div>
<div class="indent2"><span class="nm">1.</span><p><span class="cl">Inference:</span> If all were done k'Tiknan, the Korban is Kosher. (This shows that 'k'Tiknan' means with proper intent!)</p></div>
<div class="indent1"><span class="nm">(i)</span><p><span class="cl">Rejection #2A (of the source for Reish Lakish - Rava):</span> (The Mishnah is Chachamim. K'Tiknan means with intent Chutz li'Zmano.) Lo k'Tiknan means with intent Chutz li'Mkomo, for this prevents the Korban from becoming Pigul, i.e. with intent Chutz li'Zmano;</p></div>
<div class="indent2"><span class="nm">1.</span><p><span class="cl">Rejection #2B (Rav Ashi):</span> Rava could also explain Lo k'Tiknan to mean Lo Lishmah, for this disqualifies a Chatas and prevents it from becoming Pigul.</p></div>
<div class="indent1"><span class="nm">(j)</span><p><span class="cl">Question (against Rava and Rav Ashi):</span> Above (f:2), we derived from the Mishnah that if the first Matanah was (with intent) Chutz li'Zmano and the rest were proper, there is Kares. This is like R. Meir according to Reish Lakish!</p></div>
<div class="indent1"><span class="nm">(k)</span><p><span class="cl">Answer:</span> The inference is wrong. There is no Kares;</p></div>
<div class="indent2"><span class="nm">1.</span><p>The Mishnah teaches that (even) if all the Zerikos were done k'Tiknan and one was done Lo k'Tiknan, it is Pasul;</p></div>
<div class="indent2"><span class="nm">2.</span><p>The words 'there is no Kares' are only for parallel structure to the Reisha, but not to make inferences.</p></div>
