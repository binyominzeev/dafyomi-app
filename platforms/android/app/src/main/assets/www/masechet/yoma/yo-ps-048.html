<div class="indent1"><span class="nm">(a)</span><p><span class="cl">Question:</span> Would the K'li Shareis be Mekadesh if he stuck the Kometz to its inner walls (fulfilling Toch) or must it fall to the bottom (a proper Hanachah)?</p></div>

<div class="indent1"><span class="nm">(c)</span><p><span class="cl">Question (Mar b. R. Ashi):</span> What if he turned over the K'li Shareis and stuck the Kometz into its base (a proper Hanachah but not Toch?</p></div>

<div class="indent1"><span class="nm">(f)</span><p><span class="cl">Answer:</span> The Beraisa teaches that it is in between.</p></div>
<div class="indent1"><span class="nm">(g)</span><p><span class="cl">Question (after citing the Halachos of collecting and spilling blood and their sources R. Papa asks):</span> If the Ketores spilled on the floor from the M'lo Chafnav:</p></div>
<div class="indent2"><span class="nm">1.</span><p>Do we say that his hand is like the neck of the animal (and the Ketores would be Pesulah like the blood which spilled from the animal's neck) or;</p></div>

<div class="indent1"><span class="nm">(h)</span><p><span class="cl">Answer:</span> Teiku.</p></div>
<div class="indent1"><span class="nm">(i)</span><p><span class="cl">Question:</span> If he thought (as he did the Chafinah) to be Maktir the Ketores the next day, do we learn from "M'lo" to connect it to the Minchah or not?</p></div>
<div class="indent1"><span class="nm">(j)</span><p><span class="cl">Answer:</span> We see from R. Akiva's addition to the Mishnah in Iduyos that since Linah creates a P'sul, so, too, does Machshavah.</p></div>
<div class="bbbline">48b----------------------------------------48b</p></div>
<div class="indent1"><span class="nm">(k)</span><p><span class="cl">Question:</span> Is the Chatiyah of the coals an Avodah, such that a Machshavah could make it Pigul, or is a Machshir not considered like the Mitzvah itself?</p></div>

<div class="indent1"><span class="nm">(a)</span><p><span class="cl">Question (asked of R. Sheishes):</span> What if the Holachah of the blood of a Korban is performed with the left hand?</p></div>
<div class="indent1"><span class="nm">(b)</span><p><span class="cl">Answer:</span> We see from our Mishnah (where the Kaf is carried in his left hand) that carrying with the left is Kosher.</p></div>
<div class="indent2"><span class="nm">1.</span><p><span class="cl">Question:</span> Why didn't R. Sheishes learn directly from the Mishnah in Tamid where Holachah (of the Eivarim) is done with the left hand?</p></div>
<div class="indent2"><span class="nm">2.</span><p><span class="cl">Answer:</span> We might have differentiated since the Eivarim are not integral to the Kaparah as the Zerikah (and its associated Holachah) are.</p></div>
