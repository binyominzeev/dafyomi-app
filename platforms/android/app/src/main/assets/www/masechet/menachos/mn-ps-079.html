<div class="indent1"><span class="nm">(a)</span><p><span class="cl">R. Yehudah:</span> R. Eliezer and R. Yehoshua agree that if it was slaughtered and found to be Treifah or Ba'al Mum, the bread is not Kadosh. If it was slaughtered Chutz li'Zmano, the bread is Kadosh;</p></div>
<div class="indent2"><span class="nm">1.</span><p>They argue about Chutz li'Mkomo. R. Eliezer says that the bread becomes Kadosh, and R. Yehoshua says that it does not.</p></div>
<div class="indent2"><span class="nm">2.</span><p><span class="cl">R. Eliezer:</span> Chutz li'Zmano and Chutz li'Mkomo are both Pesulim. Just like the former is Mekadesh the bread, also the latter;</p></div>
<div class="indent2"><span class="nm">3.</span><p><span class="cl">R. Yehoshua:</span> Chutz li'Mkomo and Ba'al Mum are both Pesulim. Just like the latter is not Mekadesh the bread, also the former.</p></div>
<div class="indent2"><span class="nm">4.</span><p><span class="cl">R. Eliezer:</span> Chutz li'Mkomo is more similar to Chutz li'Zmano, for these Pesulim are due to intent. A Mum is a physical Pesul.</p></div>
<div class="indent2"><span class="nm">5.</span><p><span class="cl">R. Yehoshua:</span> No, Chutz li'Mkomo is more similar to a Mum, for these Pesulim do not have Kares, but Chutz li'Zmano has Kares;</p></div>
<div class="indent3"><span class="nm">i.</span><p>Further, we can learn Chutz li'Mkomo from Lo Lishmah, which is also Pasul due to intent, and it does not have Kares!</p></div>
<div class="indent2"><span class="nm">6.</span><p>R. Eliezer did not respond.</p></div>
<div class="indent1"><span class="nm">(b)</span><p><span class="cl">Question:</span> Why does (R. Eliezer, according to) R. Meir consider Treifah to be a Pesul before Shechitah (the bread is not Kadosh), and Ba'al Mum to be a Pesul after Shechitah (the bread is Kadosh)?</p></div>
<div class="indent1"><span class="nm">(c)</span><p><span class="cl">Answer:</span> The Mum is Dukin (a film) in the eye, according to R. Akiva, who says Im Alah Lo Yered (if such a Ba'al Mum was brought on the Mizbe'ach, we offer it. We do not take it down.)</p></div>
<div class="indent2"><span class="nm">1.</span><p>R. Yehoshua argues. Granted, the animal itself is not taken down, but it is not Mekadesh bread.</p></div>
<div class="indent1"><span class="nm">(d)</span><p>If a Chatas (R. Tam - Todah, and the same applies to all Kodshim Kalim) was slaughtered Chutz li'Zmano, Im Alah Lo Yered;</p></div>
<div class="indent1"><span class="nm">(e)</span><p><span class="cl">(Rabah):</span> If it was slaughtered Chutz li'Mkomo, Yered. (We adopt the text of Rashi Kesav Yad and Shitah. Rabah preceded Rava, so presumably his opinion is given first.)</p></div>
<div class="indent1"><span class="nm">(f)</span><p><span class="cl">(Rava):</span> Lo Yered.</p></div>
<div class="indent1"><span class="nm">(g)</span><p>Rabah holds like R. Yehoshua, and Rava holds like R. Eliezer.</p></div>
<div class="indent1"><span class="nm">(h)</span><p><span class="cl">Version #1:</span> Rava retracted and adopted Rabah's opinion, for R. Eliezer retracted and adopted R. Yehoshua's opinion.</p></div>
<div class="indent1"><span class="nm">(i)</span><p><span class="cl">Version #2:</span> Even though R. Eliezer retracted, Rava did not retract;</p></div>
<div class="indent2"><span class="nm">1.</span><p>R. Eliezer retracted because Chutz li'Mkomo is more similar to Lo Lishmah (the bread is not Kadosh);</p></div>
<div class="indent2"><span class="nm">2.</span><p>Regarding the Korban itself, even if we learn from Lo Lishmah, (even though Chatas Lo Lishmah is Pasul,) Lo Yered (since some Korbanos are Kosher Lo Lishmah).</p></div>
<div class="indent1"><span class="nm">(j)</span><p><span class="cl">(Mishnah):</span> If it was slaughtered Lo Lishmah...</p></div>
<div class="indent1"><span class="nm">(k)</span><p><span class="cl">Question (Rav Papa):</span> Why does our Tana teach about the Milu'im (which do not apply to all generations) and omit Eil Nazir, which applies to all generations?</p></div>
<div class="indent1"><span class="nm">(l)</span><p><span class="cl">Answer:</span> Our Tana teaches about the first Korban (Rashi - that was Mekadesh bread. Other Korbanos can be learned from it.)</p></div>
<div class="subject"><span class="nm">2)</span><p>SHECHITAH IS MEKADESH THE NESACHIM</p></div>
<div class="indent1"><span class="nm">(a)</span><p><span class="cl">(Mishnah):</span> If Nesachim were Mekudash in a Kli and the Zevach was found to be Pasul:</p></div>
<div class="indent2"><span class="nm">1.</span><p>If there is another Zevach without Nesachim, these are offered for that Zevach;</p></div>
<div class="indent2"><span class="nm">2.</span><p>If not, we allow them to become Pasul through Linah.</p></div>
<div class="indent1"><span class="nm">(b)</span><p><span class="cl">(Gemara - Ze'iri):</span> Shechitah of the Zevach is the only thing that is Mekadesh Nesachim (Rashi - to become Nifsalim through Linah or Yotzei; Tosfos - to obligate them to be brought with a particular Zevach). We learn from "Zevach u'Nesachim."</p></div>
<div class="indent1"><span class="nm">(c)</span><p><span class="cl">Question (Mishnah):</span> If Nesachim were Mekudash in a Kli and the Zevach was found to be Pasul:</p></div>
<div class="indent2"><span class="nm">1.</span><p>If there is another Zevach without Nesachim, these are offered for it. If not, they become Pasul through Linah.</p></div>
<div class="indent2"><span class="nm">2.</span><p><span class="cl">Suggestion:</span> The Zevach became Pasul through Shechitah. (This shows that Nesachim become Mekudash without (a Kosher) Shechitah!)</p></div>
<div class="indent1"><span class="nm">(d)</span><p><span class="cl">Answer:</span> No, the Zevach became Pasul through Zerikah. (Shechitah was Kosher, and it was Mekadesh the Nesachim.)</p></div>
<div class="indent1"><span class="nm">(e)</span><p><span class="cl">Suggestion:</span> This is like Rebbi, who says that if one of two Matirim were offered, it is partially Mekadesh.</p></div>
<div class="indent1"><span class="nm">(f)</span><p><span class="cl">Rejection:</span> It is even like R. Elazar b'Rebbi Shimon (who says that one of two Matirim does not Mekadesh at all). The case is, Kabalas ha'Dam was Kosher, and then the blood spilled;</p></div>
<div class="bbbline">79b----------------------------------------79b</p></div>
<div class="indent2"><span class="nm">1.</span><p>R. Elazar holds like his father, who says that since the blood was ready for Zerikah, (in some respects) it is as if Zerikah was done.</p></div>
<div class="subject"><span class="nm">3)</span><p>WHEN NESACHIM MAY BE OFFERED WITH ANOTHER ZEVACH</p></div>
<div class="indent1"><span class="nm">(a)</span><p><span class="cl">(Mishnah):</span> If there is another Zevach without Nesachim, these are offered for it.</p></div>
<div class="indent1"><span class="nm">(b)</span><p>Question Rav Chisda taught that if oil was designated for a Minchah, it may not be used for another Minchah! (Similarly, we cannot use Nesachim for another Zevach!)</p></div>
<div class="indent1"><span class="nm">(c)</span><p><span class="cl">Answer (R. Yanai):</span> Beis Din (of Kohanim) stipulate that Nesachim (for Korbanos Tzibur) are Kodesh on condition that if they are not needed, they may be used for a different Zevach.</p></div>
<div class="indent1"><span class="nm">(d)</span><p><span class="cl">Question:</span> If so, they should stipulate also about oil!</p></div>
<div class="indent1"><span class="nm">(e)</span><p><span class="cl">Answer:</span> Oil is different. It is part of the Minchah itself. (Therefore, it would not help to stipulate.)</p></div>
<div class="indent1"><span class="nm">(f)</span><p><span class="cl">Question:</span> (The Mishnah says, if there is not another Zevach without Nesachim, they become Pasul through Linah.) They should stipulate that if the Nesachim are not needed, they are Chulin!</p></div>
<div class="indent1"><span class="nm">(g)</span><p><span class="cl">Answer:</span> We decreed not to do so, lest people think that something that was in a Kli Shares remains Chulin (without stipulating).</p></div>
<div class="indent1"><span class="nm">(h)</span><p><span class="cl">Question:</span> We should decree not to use Nesachim for a different Zevach, lest people think that this may be done without stipulating!</p></div>
<div class="indent1"><span class="nm">(i)</span><p><span class="cl">Answer:</span> Matisyahu ben Yehudah taught that the case is that there was another Zevach (without Nesachim) slaughtered at the time. (People will think that the Nesachim were for that Zevach from the beginning.)</p></div>
<div class="indent1"><span class="nm">(j)</span><p><span class="cl">Inference:</span> If there was not another Zevach slaughtered at the time, the Nesachim are Pesulim.</p></div>
<div class="indent1"><span class="nm">(k)</span><p><span class="cl">Question:</span> Why does the Mishnah say 'if there was no other Zevach, the Nesachim are Pesulim'? It should say 'if there was no other Zevach slaughtered at the time, they are Pesulim'!</p></div>
<div class="indent1"><span class="nm">(l)</span><p><span class="cl">Answer:</span> Indeed, the Mishnah means this;</p></div>
<div class="indent2"><span class="nm">1.</span><p>If there was another Zevach slaughtered at the time, the Nesachim are offered with it. If not, it is as if they became Pesulim through Linah.</p></div>
<div class="indent1"><span class="nm">(m)</span><p><span class="cl">Question:</span> R. Shimon does not say that Beis Din stipulates!</p></div>
<div class="indent2"><span class="nm">1.</span><p><span class="cl">(Rav Idi bar Avin):</span> According to R. Shimon, Temidim that will not be needed this year can be redeemed (in order to buy them back with next year's Shekalim to use for Temidim of next year) only if they have a blemish;</p></div>
<div class="indent2"><span class="nm">2.</span><p>Chachamim permit redeeming without a blemish (because Beis Din stipulated)!</p></div>
<div class="indent1"><span class="nm">(n)</span><p><span class="cl">Answer:</span> He holds that Beis Din stipulates only when there is no other solution. (There, without stipulating, the extra Temidim are Ro'eh (graze until they get a Mum, and then they are redeemed).)</p></div>
<div class="subject"><span class="nm">4)</span><p>KORBANOS DUE TO TODAH</p></div>
<div class="indent1"><span class="nm">(a)</span><p><span class="cl">(Mishnah):</span> The following are offered without bread:</p></div>
<div class="indent2"><span class="nm">1.</span><p>Vlad (the child of a) Todah, Temuras Todah (if one said 'this animal is in place of this Todah, it gets some Kedushah of Todah), and Chalifas Todah (an animal designated to replace a lost Todah, and later the Todah was found and offered).</p></div>
<div class="indent1"><span class="nm">(b)</span><p>We learn from "v'Hikriv Al Zevach Todah." Todah requires bread, but its child, Temurah or Chalifah does not.</p></div>
<div class="indent1"><span class="nm">(c)</span><p><span class="cl">(Gemara - Beraisa) Question:</span> Why does it say "Todah Yakriv"?</p></div>
<div class="indent2"><span class="nm">1.</span><p><span class="cl">Answer - Question:</span> What is the source that if a Todah was lost, a replacement was designated, and the Todah was found, either may be offered l'Shem Todah with bread?</p></div>
<div class="indent2"><span class="nm">2.</span><p><span class="cl">Answer:</span> 'Ha'Todah Yakriv'.</p></div>
<div class="indent2"><span class="nm">3.</span><p><span class="cl">Suggestion:</span> Perhaps also the second animal to be offered requires bread!</p></div>
<div class="indent2"><span class="nm">4.</span><p><span class="cl">Rejection:</span> "Yakrivenu" (singular) teaches that only one requires bread.</p></div>
<div class="indent3"><span class="nm">i.</span><p>After the Torah permitted (offering either l'Shem Todah), it excluded (bringing bread with the other. This is like the text of Rashi and R. Gershom; there is no 'Vov' before 'Mi'et'.)</p></div>
<div class="indent2"><span class="nm">5.</span><p><span class="cl">Question:</span> What is the source that Vlad, Chalifas and Temuras Todah are offered? (Really, we only ask about Vlad and Temurah. Above, we gave the source for Chalifah. Chalifah is merely mentioned along with them.)</p></div>
<div class="indent2"><span class="nm">6.</span><p><span class="cl">Answer:</span> It says "Im Al Todah."</p></div>
<div class="indent2"><span class="nm">7.</span><p><span class="cl">Suggestion:</span> Perhaps they require bread!</p></div>
<div class="indent2"><span class="nm">8.</span><p><span class="cl">Rejection:</span> "V'Hikriv Al Zevach ha'Todah" teaches that Todah requires bread, but its Vlad, Chalifah or Temurah does not.</p></div>
