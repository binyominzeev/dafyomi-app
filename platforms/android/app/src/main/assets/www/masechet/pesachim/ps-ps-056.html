<div class="subject"><span class="nm">1)</span><p>THINGS CHACHAMIM DID NOT OBJECT TO</p></div>
<div class="indent1"><span class="nm">(a)</span><p><span class="cl">(Beraisa):</span> Chachamim approved of three things that Chizkiyah did, and disapproved of three; they approved of the following:</p></div>
<div class="indent2"><span class="nm">1.</span><p>He dragged the bones of his father (Achaz, a Rasha) around on ropes [to atone for him and to chastise Resha'im);</p></div>
<div class="indent2"><span class="nm">2.</span><p>He ground up the copper snake that Moshe had made [to save people who had been bitten by snakes - people had started to worship it];</p></div>
<div class="indent2"><span class="nm">3.</span><p>He hid Sefer ha'Refu'os (Rashi - because people used it for quick cures, and did not turn to Hash-m to be healed; Rambam - astrologers determined which images would be helpful for which sicknesses - it is forbidden to use them).</p></div>
<div class="indent1"><span class="nm">(b)</span><p>They disapproved of three:</p></div>
<div class="indent2"><span class="nm">1.</span><p>He cut off the doors of the Heichal and sent them to Sancheriv [for tribute, hoping to dissuade his impending attack];</p></div>
<div class="indent2"><span class="nm">2.</span><p>He dammed up the waters of the upper Gichon [to cause problems for Sancheriv's army. Regarding both of these, he should have relied on Hash-m's promise to save Yerushalayim];</p></div>
<div class="indent2"><span class="nm">3.</span><p>[To allow more time for people to become Tahor for Pesach,] he was Me'aber the year (added a second Adar) in Nisan (really, on Adar 30, which has potential to become Rosh Chodesh Nisan).</p></div>
<div class="indent1"><span class="nm">(c)</span><p><span class="cl">(Mishnah):</span> They would <i>Markiv</i> date trees the entire day.</p></div>
<div class="indent1"><span class="nm">(d)</span><p><span class="cl">Question:</span> What did they do?</p></div>
<div class="indent1"><span class="nm">(e)</span><p><span class="cl">Answer #1 (Rav Yehudah):</span> They would bring moist myrtle and beer of laurel berries and barley flour in a Keli within 40 days [of when it was ground]; they cook them together and pour it into the 'heart' (central trunk) of the tree;</p></div>
<div class="indent2"><span class="nm">1.</span><p>Any tree within four Amos of it will dry up immediately unless the same is done for it [because the tree that was treated will absorb all the moisture from the soil].</p></div>
<div class="indent1"><span class="nm">(f)</span><p><span class="cl">Answer #2 (Rav Acha brei d'Rava):</span> They would graft young branches onto old trees (alternatively - male branches that produce dates onto sterile female trees. Above (53A) we said that R. Ilai cut [dates of] a male tree whose dates never ripen - we must say that this does not apply to all male trees.)</p></div>
<div class="indent1"><span class="nm">(g)</span><p><span class="cl">(Mishnah):</span> They were Korech Shma.</p></div>
<div class="indent1"><span class="nm">(h)</span><p><span class="cl">Question:</span> What did they do?</p></div>
<div class="indent1"><span class="nm">(i)</span><p><span class="cl">Answer #1 (Rav Yehudah):</span> They said the first verse without pausing (between it and "V'Ohavta"; alternatively, between "Yisrael" and "Hash-m");</p></div>
<div class="indent1"><span class="nm">(j)</span><p><span class="cl">Answer #2 (Rava):</span> They paused then, but they would not pause between "ha'Yom" and "Al Levavecha," connoting that today one must put Torah to one's heart today, but tomorrow he need not.</p></div>
<div class="indent1"><span class="nm">(k)</span><p><span class="cl">(Beraisa) Question:</span> How were they Korech Shma?</p></div>
<div class="indent1"><span class="nm">(l)</span><p><span class="cl">Answer #1 (R. Meir):</span> They said the first verse without pausing.</p></div>
<div class="indent1"><span class="nm">(m)</span><p><span class="cl">Answer #2 (R. Yehudah):</span> They paused, but they did not say 'Baruch Shem Kavod Malchuso l'Olam va'Ed'.</p></div>
<div class="indent1"><span class="nm">(n)</span><p><span class="cl">Question:</span> Why do we say it? (It is not in the Torah!)</p></div>
<div class="indent1"><span class="nm">(o)</span><p><span class="cl">Answer:</span> We say it on account of Reish Lakish's teaching:</p></div>
<div class="indent2"><span class="nm">1.</span><p><span class="cl">(Reish Lakish):</span> "Va'Yikra Yakov El Banav va'Yomer He'asfu v'Agidah Lachem" - Yakov wanted to tell his sons Ketz ha'Yamin (these are the last words in Sefer Daniel - tradition says that this is like Ketz ha'<i>Yamim</i>, the end of days, which refers to the ultimate redemption or revival of the dead) - the Shechinah departed.</p></div>
<div class="indent2"><span class="nm">2.</span><p>Yakov feared that this was because one of his children was improper, just like Avraham fathered Yishmael and Yitzchak fathered Esav.</p></div>
<div class="indent2"><span class="nm">3.</span><p><span class="cl">His sons:</span> "Shma Yisrael Hash-m Elokeinu Hash-m Echad" - just like Hash-m is One in your heart, also in ours.</p></div>
<div class="indent2"><span class="nm">4.</span><p><span class="cl">Yakov:</span> Baruch Shem Kavod Malchuso l'Olam va'Ed (this is what people say after the Kohen Gadol says Hash-m's name in the Mikdash - we learn from "Ki Shem Hash-m Ekra Havu Godel Leilokeinu." Rashi (Bereishis 46:29) cites a Medrash that Yakov was saying Shma when he was reunited with Yosef, <i>before</i> the above dialogue - presumably this refers to the essence of Shema, Kabalas Ol Malchus Shomayim, even if it was not the same text we say today - <b>PF</b>.)</p></div>
<div class="indent2"><span class="nm">5.</span><p>Chachamim considered whether or not it should be included in Shma:</p></div>
<div class="indent3"><span class="nm">i.</span><p>We should not say it, for Moshe did not write it in the Torah;</p></div>
<div class="indent3"><span class="nm">ii.</span><p>On the other hand, we should say it, for Yakov said it!</p></div>
<div class="indent2"><span class="nm">6.</span><p>They enacted to say it quietly.</p></div>
<div class="indent1"><span class="nm">(p)</span><p><span class="cl">(R. Yitzchak):</span> This is like a king's daughter who smelled seasoned meat - if she will say [that she wants some], it will be disgraceful for her; if she will not say, she will be in pain (if one smelled food and desires it, it is dangerous not to taste it - Mishnah Berurah 159:2. Maharal - Baruch Shem Kavod is an exalted praise that angels say, Benei Yisrael are worthy to say it only on Yom Kipur; Nefesh ha'Chayim - Hash-m is so exalted that it belittles Him to call Him King of our lowly world [like it belittled the princess to request the meat in the parable] - in His humility, he lets us say it and considers it a praise.)</p></div>
<div class="indent2"><span class="nm">1.</span><p>Her servants brought some for her covertly.</p></div>
<div class="indent1"><span class="nm">(q)</span><p><span class="cl">(R. Avahu):</span> They enacted to say [Baruch Shem Kavod...] aloud, lest heretics claim [that we say improper things at that time, e.g. heresy].</p></div>
<div class="indent1"><span class="nm">(r)</span><p>There are no heretics in Neharda'a, therefore they say it quietly.</p></div>
<div class="subject"><span class="nm">2)</span><p>PRACTICES IN YERICHO</p></div>
<div class="indent1"><span class="nm">(a)</span><p><span class="cl">(Beraisa - R. Meir):</span> Six things were done in Yericho, Chachamim approved of only the following three:</p></div>
<div class="indent2"><span class="nm">1.</span><p>They would Markiv date trees the entire day [on Erev Pesach]; they were Korech Shma; they harvested Chadash;</p></div>
<div class="indent1"><span class="nm">(b)</span><p>Chachamim disapproved of three:</p></div>
<div class="indent2"><span class="nm">1.</span><p>They made piles of Chadash;</p></div>
<div class="indent2"><span class="nm">2.</span><p>They breached the walls of their gardens and orchards to enable poor people to enter and eat fruit that fell on Shabbos and Yom Tov, in famine years;</p></div>
<div class="indent2"><span class="nm">3.</span><p>They benefited from branches of Hekdesh carob and sycamore trees.</p></div>
<div class="indent1"><span class="nm">(c)</span><p><span class="cl">R. Yehudah:</span> If Chachamim approved [of the first three], people would do so everywhere!</p></div>
<div class="indent2"><span class="nm">1.</span><p>Rather, Chachamim disapproved of all six; three of them they did not protest - grafting the entire day, Korech Shma, harvesting and making piles of Chadash;</p></div>
<div class="indent2"><span class="nm">2.</span><p>They protested about three - benefiting from Hekdesh branches, breaching gardens and orchards to enable the poor to eat fruit that fell on Shabbos and Yom Tov in famine years, and leaving Pe'ah from Yerakos.</p></div>
<div class="indent1"><span class="nm">(d)</span><p><span class="cl">Question:</span> R. Yehudah does not forbid harvesting Chadash!</p></div>
<div class="indent2"><span class="nm">1.</span><p><span class="cl">(Mishnah):</span> In Yericho they harvested and made piles of Chadash - Chachamim approved of harvesting but disapproved of making piles (perhaps he will eat it - he could wait to make piles without any loss), but they did not protest.</p></div>
<div class="bbbline">56b----------------------------------------56b</p></div>
<div class="indent2"><span class="nm">2.</span><p>This is like R. Yehudah, who says that they [disapproved of all six], the only distinction was which they protested about, and it says that they approved of harvesting!</p></div>
<div class="indent2"><span class="nm">3.</span><p><span class="cl">Counter-question:</span> [You challenged the Beraisa from the Mishnah - the Beraisa itself is difficult! It says that they did not protest about three, but] it lists four (grafting the entire day, Korech Shma, harvesting and piling Chadash)!</p></div>
<div class="indent1"><span class="nm">(e)</span><p><span class="cl">Answer to both questions:</span> We must delete harvesting from the Beraisa.</p></div>
<div class="indent1"><span class="nm">(f)</span><p>They benefited from branches of Hekdesh carob and sycamore trees - they said 'Our ancestors were Makdish only the trunks, we may benefit from the branches of Hekdesh carob and sycamore trees.</p></div>
<div class="indent1"><span class="nm">(g)</span><p>They permitted Gedulim (things that grow from) Hekdesh - they hold like the opinion that Me'ilah does not apply to Gedulei Hekdesh.</p></div>
<div class="indent1"><span class="nm">(h)</span><p>Chachamim disapproved - they hold that even though Me'ilah does not apply, it is forbidden!</p></div>
<div class="indent1"><span class="nm">(i)</span><p><span class="cl">(Beraisa):</span> They breached [to enable the poor to eat fruit that fell on Shabbos].</p></div>
<div class="indent1"><span class="nm">(j)</span><p><span class="cl">(Ula):</span> They argue about dates that [became detached on Shabbos and] fell into 'nets' of bent Lulavim at the top of the tree - Chachamim forbid lest one climb up to get them and detach attached dates; Anshei Yericho do not decree (Rashi; Tosfos - it is forbidden to take anything from a tree on Shabbos! We must say that they were detached and caught in nets before Shabbos, and on Shabbos they fell to the ground; Chachamim forbid because they were forbidden at the start of Shabbos);</p></div>
<div class="indent2"><span class="nm">1.</span><p>All permit dates caught below the branches, for there are no attached dates there.</p></div>
<div class="indent1"><span class="nm">(k)</span><p><span class="cl">Question (Rava):</span> They are Muktzeh (they were attached (Tosfos - they were on the tree) at the start of Shabbos)!</p></div>
<div class="indent2"><span class="nm">1.</span><p><span class="cl">Suggestion:</span> Since they were fit for ravens to eat (one who raises ravens may lead them there to eat them), they are considered prepared for people.</p></div>
<div class="indent2"><span class="nm">2.</span><p><span class="cl">Rejection:</span> Something fit for people to eat is not considered prepared for dogs - will you say that something fit for ravens is considered prepared for people?!</p></div>
<div class="indent3"><span class="nm">i.</span><p><span class="cl">(Mishnah - R. Yehudah):</span> If an animal died on Shabbos, we may not cut up the carcass in front of dogs, since it was not prepared.</p></div>
<div class="indent1"><span class="nm">(l)</span><p><span class="cl">Answer (Ula):</span> Indeed, something fit for people to eat is not considered prepared for dogs, because a person does not abandon something he can use;</p></div>
<div class="indent2"><span class="nm">1.</span><p>Something fit for ravens is considered prepared for people - a person intends to use anything which he might need.</p></div>
<div class="indent1"><span class="nm">(m)</span><p><span class="cl">(Ravin):</span> They argue about dates caught below the branches - Chachamim hold that something fit for ravens is not considered prepared for people, Anshei Yericho hold that it is;</p></div>
<div class="indent2"><span class="nm">1.</span><p>All forbid dates in the 'nets', lest one climb up to get them and detach.</p></div>
<div class="indent1"><span class="nm">(n)</span><p><span class="cl">(Mishnah):</span> They left Pe'ah from Yerakos.</p></div>
<div class="indent1"><span class="nm">(o)</span><p><span class="cl">Question:</span> Do they argue with the Mishnah?!</p></div>
<div class="indent2"><span class="nm">1.</span><p><span class="cl">(Mishnah):</span> Pe'ah must be left from any food with the following properties - people guard it, it grows from the ground, it is harvested at once, and it may be stored for a long time.</p></div>
<div class="indent2"><span class="nm">2.</span><p>It says 'food' to exclude Sefichim (things that grew by themselves, e.g. from seeds which fell) of safflower or woad (a dye);</p></div>
<div class="indent2"><span class="nm">3.</span><p>'People guard it' excludes Hefker; 'it grows from the ground' excludes mushrooms and truffles; 'it is harvested at once' excludes figs; 'it may be stored for a long time' excludes Yerek.</p></div>
<div class="indent1"><span class="nm">(p)</span><p><span class="cl">Answer (Rav Yehudah):</span> They left Pe'ah from turnip leaves [or roots; they can be stored via pickling with the bulbs attached - Chazon Ish Shevi'is, near end of Siman 7]:</p></div>
<div class="indent2"><span class="nm">1.</span><p>Anshei Yericho hold that storing by means of something else is considered storing; Chachamim disagree.</p></div>
