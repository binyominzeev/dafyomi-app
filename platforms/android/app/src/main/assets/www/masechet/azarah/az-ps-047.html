<p class="dedicationbox">AVODAH ZARAH 47 (16 Adar) - Dedicated by Mr. Avraham Yitzchak Berger of Jerusalem/Lakewood, in memory of his father, Reb Pinchas ben Reb Avraham Yitzchak, on the day of his Yahrzeit. </p>

<p class="bas subject"><span class="nm">1)</span>DOES 'SHINUY' PERMIT THINGS TO BE USED IN THE 'MIKDASH'?</p>
<p class="bas indent1"><span class="nm">(a)</span><span class="cl">Answer #1 (Mar Zutra brei d'Rav Nachman - Mishnah):</span> If any animal became disqualified from being a Korban, its offspring are not disqualified;</p>
<p class="bas indent2"><span class="nm">1.</span><span class="cl">(Beraisa - R. Eliezer):</span> They are forbidden.</p>
<p class="bas indent2"><span class="nm">2.</span><span class="cl">Version #1:</span> (They argue about whether the Shinuy of birth permits a fetus in an animal that became disqualified, and similarly, whether Shinuy permits the wheat.)</p>
<p class="bas indent1"><span class="nm">(b)</span><span class="cl">Rejection (and Answer #2):</span> Rav Nachman taught that they argue in a case that the animal became pregnant <i>after</i> it became disqualified;</p>
<p class="bas indent2"><span class="nm">1.</span>If it was pregnant <i>when</i> (it became disqualified because) a man had relations with it (or it gored or was Ne'evad), all agree that the calf is disqualified.</p>
<p class="bas indent2"><span class="nm">2.</span>The Shinuy of birth does not permit the calf. Here also, it does not permit the wheat!</p>
<p class="bas indent2"><span class="nm">3.</span><span class="cl">Version #2:</span> They argue in a case that the animal became pregnant after it became disqualified;</p>
<p class="bas indent3"><span class="nm">i.</span>If it was pregnant when a man had relations with it, all agree that the calf is disqualified.</p>
<p class="bas indent3"><span class="nm">ii.</span>The Shinuy of birth does not permit the calf. Here also, it does not permit the wheat!</p>
<p class="bas indent1"><span class="nm">(c)</span><span class="cl">Rejection:</span> That is no proof. Birth of a calf is not a Shinuy. It merely left when the door (of the womb) opened;</p>
<p class="bas indent2"><span class="nm">1.</span>Wheat that was turned into flour changed. Perhaps it becomes permitted!</p>
<p class="bas subject"><span class="nm">2)</span>'DICHUY'</p>
<p class="bas indent1"><span class="nm">(a)</span><span class="cl">Question (Reish Lakish):</span> If a Nochri bowed to a date tree, may a Lulav of the tree be used for the Mitzvah?</p>
<p class="bas indent2"><span class="nm">1.</span>If the tree was initially planted to be worshipped, it is Asur b'Hana'ah. Surely one may not use it for the Mitzvah.</p>
<p class="bas indent2"><span class="nm">2.</span>The question is if the tree was planted and later worshipped;</p>
<p class="bas indent3"><span class="nm">i.</span>According to R. Yosi b'Rebbi Yehudah, it is Asur b'Hana'ah. Surely one may not use it for the Mitzvah;</p>
<p class="bas indent3"><span class="nm">ii.</span>The question is according to Chachamim. Is it repulsive to use it for a Mitzvah?</p>
<p class="bas indent1"><span class="nm">(b)</span><span class="cl">(Rav Dimi):</span> His question was about an Asherah after Bitul. Does Dichuy apply to Mitzvos? (If something became Pasul for a Mitzvah, after the Pesul goes away, may it be used for the Mitzvah?)</p>
<p class="bas indent2"><span class="nm">1.</span><span class="cl">Question:</span> Why didn't he settle the question from a Mishnah?</p>
<p class="bas indent3"><span class="nm">i.</span><span class="cl">(Mishnah):</span> If one covered the blood (of a slaughtered bird or Chayah) and it became exposed, he need not cover it again. If the wind (blew earth and) covered it, he must cover it.</p>
<p class="bas indent3"><span class="nm">ii.</span><span class="cl">(Rabah bar bar Chanah):</span> This is only if it became uncovered. If not, he is exempt.</p>
<p class="bas indent3"><span class="nm">iii.</span><span class="cl">Question:</span> Even if it becomes uncovered, once the Mitzvah was lost, it should not return!</p>
<p class="bas indent3"><span class="nm">iv.</span><span class="cl">Answer (Rav Papa):</span> This teaches that Ein Dichuy b'Mitzvos.</p>
<p class="bas indent2"><span class="nm">2.</span><span class="cl">Answer:</span> Reish Lakish knew that Ein Dichuy b'Mitzvos;</p>
<p class="bas indent3"><span class="nm">i.</span>He was unsure if the Tana was certain about this (and says Ein Dichuy even to be lenient), or if he was in doubt (and is stringent to require Kisuy in case the Halachah is that Ein Dichuy).</p>
<p class="bas indent1"><span class="nm">(c)</span>His question is not resolved.</p>
<p class="bas indent1"><span class="nm">(d)</span><span class="cl">Question (Rav Papa):</span> If a Nochri bowed to an animal, may its wool be used for Techeiles?</p>
<p class="bas indent2"><span class="nm">1.</span><span class="cl">Question:</span> To which use of Techeiles does he refer?</p>
<p class="bas indent3"><span class="nm">i.</span>If it is for the garments of the Kohanim, this is like Rami bar Chama's questions (if Ne'evad applies to things used for the Avodah, and if Shinuy helps)!</p>
<p class="bas indent3"><span class="nm">ii.</span>If it is for one to put on his Tzitzis, this is Reish Lakish's question (whether Dichuy applies to Mitzvos, and the question about Shinuy)!</p>
<p class="bas indent2"><span class="nm">2.</span><span class="cl">Answer:</span> Indeed, (he asked about Bigdei Kehunah;) there was no Chidush to this question. He asked it among other questions (about what may be used for the Mikdash).</p>
<p class="bas indent1"><span class="nm">(e)</span><span class="cl">Question (Rav Papa):</span> May we use its wool for Techeiles, its horns for trumpets, its thigh bones for flutes (for Leviyim to play in the Mikdash), and its intestines for strings for harps?</p>
<p class="bas indent2"><span class="nm">1.</span>According to the opinion that the primary Mitzvah of Shirah of the Leviyim is to play instruments, surely it is forbidden;</p>
<p class="bas indent2"><span class="nm">2.</span>The question is like the opinion that the primary Mitzvah of Shirah of the Leviyim is to sing.</p>
<p class="bas indent3"><span class="nm">i.</span>Since the instruments merely enhance the voices, it is permitted;</p>
<p class="bas indent3"><span class="nm">ii.</span>Or, perhaps in any case it is forbidden?</p>
<p class="bas indent1"><span class="nm">(f)</span>This question is not resolved.</p>
<p class="bas indent1"><span class="nm">(g)</span><span class="cl">Question (Rabah):</span> If a Nochri bows to a spring, may the water be used for Nesachim?</p>
<p class="bas indent2"><span class="nm">1.</span><span class="cl">Question:</span> What does he ask?</p>
<p class="bas indent3"><span class="nm">i.</span>If he asks whether he bows to his reflection or to the water, he could have asked 'if a Nochri bows to a flask of water, may one benefit from the water?'!</p>
<p class="bas indent2"><span class="nm">2.</span><span class="cl">Answer:</span> He knows that he bows to the water. The question is, does he worship the water in front of him (and it flows away, the water which comes afterwards is permitted)?</p>
<p class="bas indent3"><span class="nm">i.</span>Or, does he worship the source, and the entire spring is forbidden?</p>
<p class="bas indent2"><span class="nm">3.</span><span class="cl">Question:</span> he cannot forbid the spring!</p>
<p class="bas indent3"><span class="nm">i.</span><span class="cl">(R. Yochanan):</span> Public water cannot be forbidden.</p>
<p class="bas indent2"><span class="nm">4.</span><span class="cl">Answer:</span> The case is, the spring is contained within his property.</p>
<p class="bas subject"><span class="nm">3)</span>A COMMON WALL WITH A HOUSE OF IDOL-WORSHIP</p>
<p class="bas indent1"><span class="nm">(a)</span><span class="cl">(Mishnah):</span> If ones house had a wall adjacent to a house of idolatry, and it fell, he may not rebuild it;</p>
<p class="bas indent2"><span class="nm">1.</span>Rather, he retreats four Amos into his own property, and rebuilds it.</p>
<p class="bas indent1"><span class="nm">(b)</span>If he jointly owned the wall (and its place) with the idolatry, half of its place counts towards four Amos;</p>
<p class="bas bbbline">47b----------------------------------------47b</p>
<p class="bas indent1"><span class="nm">(c)</span>Its stones and earth are Teme'im like a rodent (which is called Sheketz) - "Shaketz Teshaktzenu."</p>
<p class="bas indent1"><span class="nm">(d)</span>R. Akiva says, they are Teme'im like a Nidah - "Tizrem Kemo Davah";</p>
<p class="bas indent2"><span class="nm">1.</span>Just like a Nidah has Tum'as Masa, also idolatry.</p>
<p class="bas indent1"><span class="nm">(e)</span><span class="cl">(Gemara) Question:</span> By distancing himself, he allows more room for idolatry!</p>
<p class="bas indent1"><span class="nm">(f)</span><span class="cl">Answer #1 (Rav Chanina of Sura):</span> He uses the area for a bathroom.</p>
<p class="bas indent2"><span class="nm">1.</span><span class="cl">Question:</span> One must relieve himself modestly, and not where he can be seen!</p>
<p class="bas indent2"><span class="nm">2.</span><span class="cl">Answer #1:</span> He uses it for a bathroom at night.</p>
<p class="bas indent2"><span class="nm">3.</span><span class="cl">Objection:</span> It was taught that a modest person is one who relieves himself at night in the same place as he does by day (i.e. far from people)!</p>
<p class="bas indent3"><span class="nm">i.</span>We established that to mean in the same <i>way</i> as he does by day. However, in any case he should not be so close to people!</p>
<p class="bas indent2"><span class="nm">4.</span><span class="cl">Answer #2:</span> He uses it for a bathroom for children.</p>
<p class="bas indent1"><span class="nm">(g)</span><span class="cl">Answer #2:</span> He fills the area with thorns.</p>
<p class="bas subject"><span class="nm">4)</span>'BITUL' OF VARIOUS TYPES OF IDOLS</p>
<p class="bas indent1"><span class="nm">(a)</span><span class="cl">(Mishnah):</span> There are three laws of houses forbidden due to idolatry:</p>
<p class="bas indent2"><span class="nm">1.</span>If a house was built from the beginning to be worshipped, it is forbidden (unless it was a Nochri's and the Nochri was Mevatel it);</p>
<p class="bas indent2"><span class="nm">2.</span>If one plastered or illustrated the walls for the sake of idolatry, when this addition is removed, the house is permitted;</p>
<p class="bas indent2"><span class="nm">3.</span>If idolatry was brought in and removed, the house is permitted.</p>
<p class="bas indent1"><span class="nm">(b)</span><span class="cl">(Gemara - Rav):</span> If one bows to a house, he forbids it.</p>
<p class="bas indent1"><span class="nm">(c)</span><span class="cl">Inference:</span> Rav holds that something that was detached (i.e. the wood and stones) and later attached is considered detached (regarding idolatry).</p>
<p class="bas indent1"><span class="nm">(d)</span><span class="cl">Question:</span> The Mishnah discusses a house <i>built</i> to be worshipped (not one that was worshipped)!</p>
<p class="bas indent1"><span class="nm">(e)</span><span class="cl">Answer:</span> It discusses a house that was built to be worshipped and was not worshipped. The same applies to one that was worshipped but not built to be worshipped.</p>
<p class="bas indent1"><span class="nm">(f)</span><span class="cl">Question:</span> If so, there are four types of forbidden houses!</p>
<p class="bas indent1"><span class="nm">(g)</span><span class="cl">Answer:</span> The Tana only counts houses with different laws of Bitul.</p>
<p class="bas indent1"><span class="nm">(h)</span><span class="cl">(Mishnah):</span> There are three laws of rocks forbidden due to idolatry:</p>
<p class="bas indent2"><span class="nm">1.</span>If a rock was originally quarried to be a base for idolatry (and the rock itself will be worshipped), it is forbidden;</p>
<p class="bas indent2"><span class="nm">2.</span>If one plastered or illustrated it for the sake of idolatry, when this addition is removed, the rock is permitted;</p>
<p class="bas indent2"><span class="nm">3.</span>If idolatry was put on it and removed, the rock is permitted.</p>
<p class="bas indent1"><span class="nm">(i)</span><span class="cl">(Gemara - R. Ami):</span> (Plastering or illustrating the rock forbids it) only if it was chiseled into the rock itself.</p>
<p class="bas indent1"><span class="nm">(j)</span><span class="cl">Objection:</span> Presumably, this is similar to the previous Mishnah, i.e. plastering or illustrating a house. There it is on the walls, and not in them!</p>
<p class="bas indent2"><span class="nm">1.</span><span class="cl">Question:</span> The plaster or design enters between the bricks!</p>
<p class="bas indent2"><span class="nm">2.</span><span class="cl">Answer:</span> The Mishnah discusses all cases, even if the house was already smooth (without crevices).</p>
<p class="bas indent1"><span class="nm">(k)</span><span class="cl">Correction:</span> Rather, R. Ami taught that even if the plaster or design was chiseled into the rock itself, when it is removed, the rock is permitted.</p>
<p class="bas indent2"><span class="nm">1.</span>One might have thought that since it was chiseled in, it is as if the rock was originally quarried for idolatry, and the entire rock is forbidden. He teaches that this is not so.</p>
