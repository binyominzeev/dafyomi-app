<div class="subject"><span class="nm">1)</span><p>COMBINING <i>SHIURIM</i> (cont.)</p></div>
<div class="indent1"><span class="nm">(a)</span><p><span class="cl">Question:</span> If a four-Tefach plank always invalidates a Sukah, then why does R. Meir, in the Beraisa, allow Sechach when there is an equal amount of space as the Pasul boards between each board?!</p></div>
<div class="indent1"><span class="nm">(b)</span><p><span class="cl">Answer (R. Huna bar R. Yehoshua):</span> That Sukah has a unique configuration which allows for an eight-Tefach Kosher Sukah in the middle.</p></div>
<div class="indent2"><span class="nm">1.</span><p>The alternating board-open, board-open takes place three times from each side of an eight-Amah-wide Sukah (the 'open' from each side meet in the middle).</p></div>
<div class="indent2"><span class="nm">2.</span><p>The boards are, indeed, Sechach Pasul, but they are within the four Amos limit for Dofen Akumah, leaving an eight Tefach Kosher Sukah.</p></div>
<div class="subject"><span class="nm">2)</span><p>LAVUD LE'HACHSHIR</p></div>
<div class="indent1"><span class="nm">(a)</span><p><span class="cl">(Abaye):</span> If one diminishes a three Tefachim open space (with either Kosher or non-Kosher Sechach) in a Sukah larger than the minimum, the Sukah is Kosher.</p></div>
<div class="indent2"><span class="nm">1.</span><p>There is neither the Shiur of space nor that of Sechach Pasul to invalidate it.</p></div>
<div class="indent2"><span class="nm">2.</span><p>If one did the same thing in a minimum Sukah it would be Pasul, because it does not have the Shiur Sechach for a Sukah.</p></div>
<div class="indent2"><span class="nm">3.</span><p>If one filled in part of the space with canes, the minimum Sukah is Kosher, because of the principle of Lavud.</p></div>
<div class="indent1"><span class="nm">(b)</span><p>The above applies when the open space is next to the wall.</p></div>
<div class="indent1"><span class="nm">(c)</span><p>R. Acha and Ravina argue what the Din will be in the middle of the Sukah.</p></div>
<div class="indent2"><span class="nm">1.</span><p><span class="cl">(Ravina):</span> We would apply Lavud in the middle of the Sukah, as well.</p></div>
<div class="indent2"><span class="nm">2.</span><p><span class="cl">(R. Acha):</span> Lavud is applied only next to a wall.</p></div>
<div class="indent1"><span class="nm">(d)</span><p><span class="cl">Question:</span> What is the rationale for Ravina?</p></div>
<div class="indent1"><span class="nm">(e)</span><p><span class="cl">Answer:</span> He applies the leniency found by the Koreh of a Mavoy.</p></div>
<div class="indent2"><span class="nm">1.</span><p>To carry in a Mavoy requires (either a Lechi at the entrance or) a Koreh across the entrance of the Mavoy.</p></div>
<div class="indent2"><span class="nm">2.</span><p>If the beam is interrupted in its middle by a space of up to three Tefachim, it is a valid Koreh (Lavud).</p></div>
<div class="indent1"><span class="nm">(f)</span><p><span class="cl">Question:</span> Why, then, would R. Acha not allow Lavud in the middle?</p></div>
<div class="indent1"><span class="nm">(g)</span><p><span class="cl">Answer:</span> This is restricted to the beams of a Mavoy, whose application is mid'Rabanan, as we see in the Beraisa where, when dealing with Tum'ah d'Oraisa, Lavud does not 'close up' a small skylight.</p></div>
<div class="indent1"><span class="nm">(h)</span><p><span class="cl">Question:</span> How will Ravina understand this Beraisa?</p></div>
<div class="indent1"><span class="nm">(i)</span><p><span class="cl">Answer:</span> Hilchos Tum'ah have unique specifications (the Halachah l'Moshe mi'Sinai is that regarding Tum'ah, there is no Lavud in the middle).</p></div>
<div class="subject"><span class="nm">3)</span><p>HALACHOS OF R. YEHUDAH B'REBBI ILAI</p></div>
<div class="indent1"><span class="nm">(a)</span><p><span class="cl">(R. Yehudah b. Ilai):</span> A skylight covered with Sechach is Kosher.</p></div>
<div class="indent1"><span class="nm">(b)</span><p><span class="cl">(R. Yishmael b'Rebbi Yosi):</span> My father taught that this only applies up to four Amos from the walls (Dofen Akumah).</p></div>
<div class="indent1"><span class="nm">(c)</span><p><span class="cl">(R. Yehudah b. Ilai):</span> A type of small fish called Abruma is permitted.</p></div>
<div class="indent1"><span class="nm">(d)</span><p><span class="cl">(R. Yishmael b'Rebbi Yosi):</span> My father taught that its Kashrus depends on which river it is drawn from (some rivers grow insects, etc).</p></div>
<div class="indent2"><span class="nm">1.</span><p><span class="cl">(Abaye):</span> A type of small fish called Tzachnasa from the River Bav is permitted.</p></div>
<div class="indent2"><span class="nm">2.</span><p><span class="cl">Question:</span> Why are we not concerned that this small fish will be interchanged with Tameh fish?</p></div>
<div class="indent2"><span class="nm">3.</span><p><span class="cl">Answer:</span> Because the Bav is a swift-flowing river and non-Kosher fish, which have no spinal cord, could not survive in it.</p></div>
<div class="indent2"><span class="nm">4.</span><p><span class="cl">Question:</span> But we find non-Kosher fish in other swift-flowing rivers!?</p></div>
<div class="indent2"><span class="nm">5.</span><p><span class="cl">Answer:</span> It is because the waters of the Bav are very salty and non-Kosher fish, which have no scales, could not survive in it.</p></div>
<div class="indent2"><span class="nm">6.</span><p><span class="cl">Question:</span> But we find non-Kosher fish in salty waters!?</p></div>
<div class="indent2"><span class="nm">7.</span><p><span class="cl">Answer:</span> It is because the mud on its river-bed is inhospitable to insects, and non-Kosher fish.</p></div>
<div class="indent2"><span class="nm">8.</span><p><span class="cl">(Ravina):</span> Fish from the Bav are now no longer permitted because the waters of other rivers, which bring insects with them, flow into it.</p></div>

<div class="subject"><span class="nm">4)</span><p>THE COURTYARD WALLS AND PI TIKRAH YORED VE'SOSEM</p></div>
<div class="indent1"><span class="nm">(a)</span><p>The walls of a Sukah may be made by uprights placed less than three Tefachim apart (Lavud).</p></div>
<div class="indent2"><span class="nm">1.</span><p>This is taught regarding the case in the Mishnah of three walls created by the houses facing into the courtyard.</p></div>
<div class="indent2"><span class="nm">2.</span><p>There we learned that if the overhanging roof extends more than four Amos into the courtyard, the house walls cannot serve as the walls of the Sukah, and it does not suffice to put Sechach over the open area beyond the overhang.</p></div>
<div class="indent1"><span class="nm">(b)</span><p><span class="cl">(Abaye):</span> The Sukah is allowed even without the uprights, as we apply Pi Tikrah Yored ve'Sosem to create inner walls from the ceilings which surround the courtyard.</p></div>
<div class="indent1"><span class="nm">(c)</span><p><span class="cl">(Rava):</span> We do not apply Pi Tikrah Yored ve'Sosem in this case.</p></div>
<div class="indent1"><span class="nm">(d)</span><p><span class="cl">Question (Rava):</span> If Pi Tikrah indeed creates walls then it should create a wall and close the third wall of a Sukah, as well (where we only have two parallel walls and boards for Sechach between them)!?</p></div>
<div class="indent1"><span class="nm">(e)</span><p><span class="cl">Answer (Abaye):</span> Abaye concedes that Pi Tikrah Yored does not apply in such a Sukah, as the Rabanan forbade it because it resembles an open Mavoy.</p></div>
<div class="indent1"><span class="nm">(f)</span><p><span class="cl">Question:</span> Shall we suggest that Rava and Abaye are arguing in the Machlokes Rav and Shmuel?</p></div>
<div class="indent2"><span class="nm">1.</span><p><span class="cl">(Rav):</span> It is permitted to carry on Shabbos inside an Achsadra that is not near a house because Pi Tikrah Yored ve'Sosem (even by all walls).</p></div>
<div class="indent2"><span class="nm">2.</span><p><span class="cl">(Shmuel):</span> One may not carry beyond four Amos.</p></div>
<div class="indent2"><span class="nm">3.</span><p>Abaye who permits an Achsadra without uprights seems to be like Rav, while Rava is like Shmuel who does not say Pi Tikrah on four sides (only on three).</p></div>
<div class="indent1"><span class="nm">(g)</span><p><span class="cl">Answer:</span> There is no Machlokes Abaye and Rava within the view of Shmuel, and even Rava will agree that Shmuel will forbid our Achsadra without uprights.</p></div>
<div class="indent2"><span class="nm">1.</span><p>The Machlokes Abaye and Rava is regarding the opinion of Rav.</p></div>
<div class="indent2"><span class="nm">2.</span><p>Abaye permits the Sukah according to Rav.</p></div>
<div class="indent2"><span class="nm">3.</span><p>Rava (who concedes that a field-Achsadra allows for Pi Tikrah) holds that the allowance there is because the roof (and, by extension, the Gud Achis walls) were made for the sake of a Sukah.</p></div>
<div class="indent2"><span class="nm">4.</span><p>But by the Sukah in the courtyard, the overhangs were not made for the Sukah, and Pi Tikrah will thus not apply.</p></div>
