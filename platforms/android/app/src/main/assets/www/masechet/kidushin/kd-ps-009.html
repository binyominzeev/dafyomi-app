<p class="bas subject"><span class="nm">1)</span>ASSESSING WHETHER OR NOT A WOMAN ACCEPTS KIDUSHIN (cont.)</p>
<p class="bas indent1"><span class="nm">(a)</span>A case occurred in which Levi was selling buttons (or glass rings) beaded on strings. Leah asked for a string of them.</p>
<p class="bas indent2"><span class="nm">1.</span><span class="cl">Levi:</span> If I give you, will you be Mekudeshes to me?</p>
<p class="bas indent2"><span class="nm">2.</span><span class="cl">Leah:</span> Give, give.</p>
<p class="bas indent1"><span class="nm">(b)</span><span class="cl">(Rav Chama):</span> This does not show consent for Kidushin.</p>
<p class="bas indent1"><span class="nm">(c)</span>A case occurred in which Reuven was drinking beer in a store, and Rachel asked for a cup of beer.</p>
<p class="bas indent2"><span class="nm">1.</span><span class="cl">Reuven:</span> If I give you, will you be Mekudeshes to me?</p>
<p class="bas indent2"><span class="nm">2.</span><span class="cl">Rachel:</span> Give to me to drink, give to me to drink.</p>
<p class="bas indent1"><span class="nm">(d)</span><span class="cl">(Rav Chama):</span> This does not show consent for Kidushin.</p>
<p class="bas indent1"><span class="nm">(e)</span>Rav Zevid ruled like this in a similar case in which a man was knocking down dates from a tree, and a woman requested some.</p>
<p class="bas indent1"><span class="nm">(f)</span><span class="cl">Question:</span> What is the law if she said 'give' only once?</p>
<p class="bas indent1"><span class="nm">(g)</span><span class="cl">Answer #1 (Ravina):</span> She is Mekudeshes.</p>
<p class="bas indent1"><span class="nm">(h)</span><span class="cl">Answer #2 (Rav Sama bar Riksa):</span> She is not Mekudeshes.</p>
<p class="bas indent1"><span class="nm">(i)</span>The Halachah is, she is not Mekudeshes.</p>
<p class="bas indent1"><span class="nm">(j)</span>The Halachah is, silk need not be appraised.</p>
<p class="bas indent1"><span class="nm">(k)</span>The Halachah follows R. Elazar (8a, that if one gives part of the promised Kidushin money, she is Mekudeshes on condition that he give the rest).</p>
<p class="bas indent1"><span class="nm">(l)</span>The Halachah follows Rava (8a, that if one gives a security in place of Kidushin money, she is not Mekudeshes).</p>
<p class="bas subject"><span class="nm">2)</span>WHO WRITES A SHTAR KIDUSHIN?</p>
<p class="bas indent1"><span class="nm">(a)</span><span class="cl">(Beraisa):</span> A Shtar Kidushin may be written on paper or pottery, even if it is not worth a Perutah. He writes 'your daughter is Mekudeshes (or Me'ureses, or like a wife) to me.'</p>
<p class="bas indent1"><span class="nm">(b)</span><span class="cl">Question (R. Zeira bar Mamal):</span> This is unlike sale documents. There, the seller writes 'my field is sold to you.' Here, the husband (who is like the buyer) writes the document!</p>
<p class="bas indent1"><span class="nm">(c)</span><span class="cl">Answer #1 (Rava):</span> Both are learned from verses.</p>
<p class="bas indent2"><span class="nm">1.</span>It says about sales "he will sell from his inheritance." The Torah attributes the sale to the seller.</p>
<p class="bas indent2"><span class="nm">2.</span>It says about Kidushin "when (a man) Yikach (will take a woman)." The Kinyan is attributed to him.</p>
<p class="bas indent2"><span class="nm">3.</span><span class="cl">Question:</span> Another verse says "Yiknu (they will buy) fields with money"!</p>
<p class="bas indent2"><span class="nm">4.</span><span class="cl">Answer:</span> We read it Yuknu (will be bought).</p>
<p class="bas indent2"><span class="nm">5.</span><span class="cl">Objection:</span> If we read it this way to agree with the other verse, also regarding Kidushin we should read "when Yukach (will be taken to) a man" to conform with "I gave my daughter to this man"!</p>
<p class="bas indent1"><span class="nm">(d)</span><span class="cl">Answer #2 (Rava):</span> Rather, a tradition from Moshe from Sinai teaches who writes the documents. Chachamim found allusions to the laws from verses.</p>
<p class="bas indent1"><span class="nm">(e)</span><span class="cl">Answer #3:</span> "I (Yirmiyah, the buyer,) took the sale document" proves that the seller writes it.</p>
<p class="bas indent1"><span class="nm">(f)</span><span class="cl">(Rava):</span> If a man wrote on paper or pottery, even if it was not worth a Perutah, 'your daughter is Mekudeshes (or Me'ureses, or like a wife) to me', he may give this to her father, or to the girl herself with her father's consent;</p>
<p class="bas indent2"><span class="nm">1.</span>This applies only if she is not yet a Bogeres.</p>
<p class="bas indent1"><span class="nm">(g)</span>If he wrote 'you are Mekudeshes (or Me'ureses, or like a wife) to me', he may give this to her, or to her father with her consent;</p>
<p class="bas indent2"><span class="nm">1.</span>This applies if she is a Bogeres.</p>
<p class="bas subject"><span class="nm">3)</span>REQUIREMENTS OF A SHTAR KIDUSHIN</p>
<p class="bas indent1"><span class="nm">(a)</span><span class="cl">Question (Reish Lakish):</span> If a Shtar Kidushin was not written Lishmah (for her sake), what is the law?</p>
<p class="bas indent2"><span class="nm">1.</span>Do we equate Kidushin to divorce? Just like a Get must be Lishmah, also a Shtar Kidushin;</p>
<p class="bas bbbline">9b----------------------------------------9b</p>
<p class="bas indent2"><span class="nm">2.</span>Or, do we equate the methods of Kidushin? Just like Kidushin money need not be minted Lishmah, a Shtar Kidushin need not be written Lishmah.</p>
<p class="bas indent1"><span class="nm">(b)</span><span class="cl">Answer (Reish Lakish):</span> We equate Kidushin to divorce - "she will leave... she will be (Mekudeshes)".</p>
<p class="bas indent1"><span class="nm">(c)</span><span class="cl">(Rava and Ravina):</span> If a Shtar Kidushin was written Lishmah but without her consent, it is valid;</p>
<p class="bas indent1"><span class="nm">(d)</span><span class="cl">(Rav Papa and Rav Sharbiya):</span> It is invalid.</p>
<p class="bas indent1"><span class="nm">(e)</span><span class="cl">Rav Papa:</span> We all equate Kidushin to divorce;</p>
<p class="bas indent2"><span class="nm">1.</span>Rava and Ravina hold that just like a Get must be Lishmah but may be written without her consent, also a Shtar Kidushin;</p>
<p class="bas indent2"><span class="nm">2.</span>I and Rav Sharbiya hold that just like a Get requires the consent of the Makneh (the one who transfers ownership, i.e. the husband), also a Shtar Kidushin requires the consent of the Makneh (the woman).</p>
<p class="bas indent1"><span class="nm">(f)</span><span class="cl">Question (against Rava and Ravina - Beraisa):</span> Shtarei Erusin and of Nisu'in (i.e. Kesuvos) must be written with the consent of both parties.</p>
<p class="bas indent2"><span class="nm">1.</span><span class="cl">Suggestion:</span> Shtarei Erusin is understood simply (they are Mekadesh)!</p>
<p class="bas indent1"><span class="nm">(g)</span><span class="cl">Answer:</span> No, it refers to documents of commitment;</p>
<p class="bas indent2"><span class="nm">1.</span><span class="cl">(Rav Gidal):</span> If the parents of Reuven and Leah promised to each other how much each will give their child, and Reuven was Mekadesh Leah, the verbal promises are legally binding.</p>
<p class="bas subject"><span class="nm">4)</span>KIDUSHIN THROUGH BI'AH</p>
<p class="bas indent1"><span class="nm">(a)</span><span class="cl">(Mishnah):</span> A women is acquired through Bi'ah...</p>
<p class="bas indent1"><span class="nm">(b)</span><span class="cl">Question:</span> What is the source of this?</p>
<p class="bas indent1"><span class="nm">(c)</span><span class="cl">Answer #1 (R. Avahu citing R. Yochanan):</span> "Who had Bi'ah with a husband" - he becomes her husband through Bi'ah.</p>
<p class="bas indent1"><span class="nm">(d)</span><span class="cl">Question (R. Zeira):</span> Why don't you learn like Rebbi?</p>
<p class="bas indent2"><span class="nm">1.</span><span class="cl">(Rebbi):</span> "(When a man will take a woman) and have Bi'ah with her" teaches that she is acquired through Bi'ah.</p>
<p class="bas indent1"><span class="nm">(e)</span><span class="cl">Answer (R. Avahu):</span> From that verse, one might have thought that he must be Mekadesh her and also have Bi'ah. The first verse shows that Bi'ah suffices by itself.</p>
<p class="bas indent1"><span class="nm">(f)</span><span class="cl">Question (R. Aba bar Mamal):</span> How could one think that he must both Mekadesh her and have Bi'ah? If so, how could one find a (virgin) Na'arah Me'orasah (who is stoned for adultery)?</p>
<p class="bas indent2"><span class="nm">1.</span>If her husband was Mekadesh her and had Bi'ah with her, she is not a virgin!</p>
<p class="bas indent2"><span class="nm">2.</span>If he was Mekadesh her but did not have Bi'ah, she is not Mekudeshes!</p>
<p class="bas indent1"><span class="nm">(g)</span><span class="cl">Answer #1 (Rabanan):</span> The case is, her husband had Bi'ah Lo k'Darkah (in the anus) with her after Kidushin.</p>
<p class="bas indent1"><span class="nm">(h)</span><span class="cl">Rejection (Abaye):</span> All agree that she is not considered a virgin after that. Tana'im argued only about a stranger who had Bi'ah Lo k'Darkah with a virgin;</p>
<p class="bas indent2"><span class="nm">1.</span><span class="cl">(Beraisa):</span> If 10 men had Bi'ah Lo k'Darkah with a virgin Na'arah Me'orasah, they are all stoned;</p>
<p class="bas indent2"><span class="nm">2.</span>Rebbi says, the first man is stoned, and the others are strangled (for she was not a virgin when they had Bi'ah with her).</p>
<p class="bas indent1"><span class="nm">(i)</span><span class="cl">Answer #2 (Rav Nachman bar Yitzchak):</span> The case is, her husband was Mekadesh her with a document;</p>
<p class="bas indent2"><span class="nm">1.</span>Since a Get divorces by itself, a Shtar Kidushin is Mekadesh by itself.</p>
<p class="bas indent1"><span class="nm">(j)</span><span class="cl">Question:</span> What does R. Yochanan learn from the verse that Rebbi expounded "and he will have Bi'ah"?</p>
<p class="bas indent1"><span class="nm">(k)</span><span class="cl">Answer:</span> It teaches that a wife is acquired through Bi'ah, but an Amah is not.</p>
<p class="bas indent2"><span class="nm">1.</span>One might have thought that a Kal va'Chomer teaches that an Amah is acquired through Bi'ah. A Yevamah is not acquired through money, but is acquired through Bi'ah. An Amah can be acquired through money, all the more so through Bi'ah!</p>
<p class="bas indent2"><span class="nm">2.</span><span class="cl">Objection:</span> One cannot learn from a Yevamah, for she is already partially acquired through the Kidushin of the deceased brother!</p>
<p class="bas indent2"><span class="nm">3.</span><span class="cl">Retraction:</span> Rather, one might have thought to learn from acquisition of a wife. "If he will take another wife (in addition to the Amah he married)" equates a slave to a wife. Just like a wife can be acquired through Bi'ah, also a slave;</p>
<p class="bas indent3"><span class="nm">i.</span>The verse teaches that this is not so.</p>
<p class="bas indent1"><span class="nm">(l)</span><span class="cl">Question:</span> How does Rebbi learn this?</p>
<p class="bas indent1"><span class="nm">(m)</span><span class="cl">Answer:</span> Had the Torah said only "he will have Bi'ah", we would learn only that Bi'ah is Mekadesh. Rather, it wrote "he will have Bi'ah with her", to teach also that Bi'ah acquire a wife, but not a Amah.</p>
<p class="bas indent1"><span class="nm">(n)</span><span class="cl">Question:</span> Rava learns from "when a man will take a woman and have Bi'ah with her" that if the Kidushin would forbid them to have Bi'ah, it does not take effect. How can Rava explain Rebbi?</p>
<p class="bas indent1"><span class="nm">(o)</span><span class="cl">Answer:</span> The Torah should have written '...or have Bi'ah with her'. Rather, it wrote "and", to allow us to learn another law.</p>
<p class="bas subject"><span class="nm">5)</span>HOW REBBI EXPOUNDS R. AVAHU'S VERSE</p>
<p class="bas indent1"><span class="nm">(a)</span><span class="cl">Question:</span> What does Rebbi learn from "a woman who had Bi'ah with a husband"?</p>
<p class="bas indent1"><span class="nm">(b)</span><span class="cl">Answer:</span> It teaches that a virgin who has Bi'ah Lo k'Darkah with her husband is no longer considered a virgin. A virgin who has Bi'ah Lo k'Darkah with a stranger is still a virgin.</p>
<p class="bas indent1"><span class="nm">(c)</span><span class="cl">Question:</span> Rebbi disagrees with this!</p>
<p class="bas indent2"><span class="nm">1.</span><span class="cl">(Beraisa):</span> If 10 men had Bi'ah Lo k'Darkah with a virgin Na'arah Me'orasah, they are all stoned;</p>
<p class="bas indent2"><span class="nm">2.</span>Rebbi says, the first man is stoned, and the others are strangled.</p>
