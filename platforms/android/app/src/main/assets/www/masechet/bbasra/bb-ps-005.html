<p class="dedicationbox">BAVA BASRA 2-8 - Two weeks of study material have been dedicated by Mrs. Estanne Abraham Fawer to honor the Yahrzeit of her father, Rav Mordechai ben Eliezer Zvi (Rabbi Morton Weiner) Z'L, who passed away on 18 Teves 5760. May the merit of supporting and advancing Dafyomi study -- which was so important to Rav Weiner -- during the weeks of his Yahrzeit serve as an Iluy for his Neshamah. </p>

<p class="bas subject"><span class="nm">1)</span>RAVINA AND RUNYA</p>
<p class="bas indent1"><span class="nm">(a)</span>Ravina surrounded Runya on all four sides and asked for compensation; Runya refused to share even the cost of a reed fence or the savings of not having to guard his field. One day Runya was harvesting one of his date trees; Ravina asked his sharecropper to bring some of Runya's dates. Runya screamed.</p>
<p class="bas indent2"><span class="nm">1.</span><span class="cl">Ravina:</span> You show that you want your trees guarded. Without a wall, even goats could take the fruit!</p>
<p class="bas indent2"><span class="nm">2.</span><span class="cl">Runya:</span> It suffices to scream at goats to stop them from eating.</p>
<p class="bas indent2"><span class="nm">3.</span><span class="cl">Ravina:</span> You would have to hire a guard to scream at them!</p>
<p class="bas indent2"><span class="nm">4.</span><span class="cl">Rava (to Runya):</span> Give Ravina enough to satisfy him. If not, I will make you pay according to Rav Huna according to R. Yosi.</p>
<p class="bas indent1"><span class="nm">(b)</span><span class="cl">Version #1 (Rashi):</span> Runya bought a field bordering on Ravina's property; Ravina thought that he has first rights to buy it, due to the law of Bar Meitzra (when one sells land, the neighbor has first rights to buy it).</p>
<p class="bas indent1"><span class="nm">(c)</span><span class="cl">(Rav Safra):</span> The law of Bar Meitzra is due to "v'Asisa ha'Yashar v'Hatov b'Einei Hash-m." Runya is poor, so it is proper to let him buy it.</p>
<p class="bas indent1"><span class="nm">(d)</span><span class="cl">Version #2 (R. Tam):</span> Runya bought a field bordering on his field. It also bordered on three of Ravina's fields, which made Ravina think that he has precedence to buy it.</p>
<p class="bas indent1"><span class="nm">(e)</span><span class="cl">(Rav Safra):</span> It is just as advantageous for Runya to buy it as for you, therefore he keeps it.</p>
<p class="bas indent1"><span class="nm">(f)</span><span class="cl">Version #3 (R. Avraham):</span> Runya was Ravina's sharecropper. He bought a field bordering on Ravina's property. Ravina thought that he has first rights to buy it, due to the law of Bar Meitzra.</p>
<p class="bas indent1"><span class="nm">(g)</span><span class="cl">(Rav Safra):</span> Because he works your field, he is like one who borders on the property. He keeps what he bought.</p>
<p class="bas subject"><span class="nm">2)</span>IS ONE BELIEVED TO SAY THAT HE ALREADY PAID?</p>
<p class="bas indent1"><span class="nm">(a)</span><span class="cl">(Mishnah):</span> If the wall of a Chatzer fell, they must rebuild it to four Amos.</p>
<p class="bas indent2"><span class="nm">1.</span>(If Reuven built it himself,) we assume that Shimon paid, unless Reuven can prove that Shimon did not pay.</p>
<p class="bas indent1"><span class="nm">(b)</span>If the wall was originally more than four Amos, neither can force the other to rebuild it more than four Amos;</p>
<p class="bas indent2"><span class="nm">1.</span>If Reuven built it more than four, and Shimon built a wall near it (fitting to put a ceiling resting on the two walls), even though he did not yet make the ceiling, Shimon must share the entire cost of the wall;</p>
<p class="bas indent2"><span class="nm">2.</span>We assume that Shimon did not pay unless he can prove that he did.</p>
<p class="bas indent1"><span class="nm">(c)</span><span class="cl">(Gemara - Reish Lakish):</span> If Levi fixed a time to pay his debt to Yehudah, and claims that he paid within the time, he is not believed;</p>
<p class="bas indent2"><span class="nm">1.</span>We are happy if people pay on time. We do not believe that he paid early!</p>
<p class="bas indent1"><span class="nm">(d)</span><span class="cl">(Abaye and Rava):</span> He is believed. Sometimes one gets the money and is eager to pay, lest he lose the opportunity!</p>
<p class="bas bbbline">5b----------------------------------------5b</p>
<p class="bas indent1"><span class="nm">(e)</span><span class="cl">(Mishnah):</span> We assume that Shimon paid, unless Reuven can prove that he did not pay.</p>
<p class="bas indent1"><span class="nm">(f)</span><span class="cl">Question:</span> What is the case?</p>
<p class="bas indent2"><span class="nm">1.</span>If he says that he paid in the proper time, obviously, we assume that he did!</p>
<p class="bas indent1"><span class="nm">(g)</span><span class="cl">Answer:</span> Rather, he says that he paid before he had to.</p>
<p class="bas indent2"><span class="nm">1.</span>This teaches that one does pay before the proper time!</p>
<p class="bas indent1"><span class="nm">(h)</span><span class="cl">Rejection:</span> This case is different, because he cannot wait to pay. The payment is due for each row of bricks when it is built!</p>
<p class="bas indent1"><span class="nm">(i)</span><span class="cl">(Seifa):</span> We assume that Shimon did not pay unless he can prove that he did.</p>
<p class="bas indent1"><span class="nm">(j)</span><span class="cl">Question:</span> What is the case?</p>
<p class="bas indent2"><span class="nm">1.</span>If he says that he paid in the proper time, he should be believed!</p>
<p class="bas indent1"><span class="nm">(k)</span><span class="cl">Answer:</span> Rather, he says that he paid before he had to.</p>
<p class="bas indent2"><span class="nm">1.</span>This teaches that one does not pay before the proper time!</p>
<p class="bas indent1"><span class="nm">(l)</span><span class="cl">Rejection:</span> This case is different. Because he does not think that he must pay, he would not pay early.</p>
<p class="bas indent1"><span class="nm">(m)</span>In practice, Rav Papa and Rav Huna brei d'Rav Yehoshua ruled like Abaye and Rava;</p>
<p class="bas indent1"><span class="nm">(n)</span>Mar bar Rav Ashi ruled like Reish Lakish.</p>
<p class="bas indent2"><span class="nm">1.</span>The Halachah follows Reish Lakish;</p>
<p class="bas indent1"><span class="nm">(o)</span>We apply the Chazakah even against orphans. (If a man died before the time to pay his debt, the lender collects from the orphans without swearing.)</p>
<p class="bas indent2"><span class="nm">1.</span>Normally, one does not collect from orphans without swearing. This is an exception, for Chazakah says that a man does not pay before the time.</p>
