<p class="bas subject"><span class="nm">1)</span>A SHALI'ACH WHO DEVIATED</p>
<p class="bas indent1"><span class="nm">(a)</span><span class="cl">(Mishnah - R. Shimon ben Gamliel):</span> All is according to the local custom.</p>
<p class="bas indent1"><span class="nm">(b)</span><span class="cl">Question:</span> Do Chachamim (the first Tana) disagree?!</p>
<p class="bas indent1"><span class="nm">(c)</span><span class="cl">Answer (Rav Ashi):</span> In a place where standard Gitin are normally written, if Reuven asked a scribe to write a standard Get and the scribe wrote a tied Get, all agree that Reuven did not want this (if it is a Get of divorce, it is invalid);</p>
<p class="bas indent2"><span class="nm">1.</span>In a place where tied Gitin are normally written, if he asked for a tied Get and the scribe wrote a standard Get, all agree that Reuven did not want this;</p>
<p class="bas indent2"><span class="nm">2.</span>They argue about a place where both kinds are written, and he asked for a standard Get, and the scribe wrote a tied Get. Chachamim say, since he asked for a standard Get, this shows that he does not want a tied Get;</p>
<p class="bas indent3"><span class="nm">i.</span>R. Shimon ben Gamliel says, Reuven merely showed that he is happy <i>even</i> with a standard Get, so the scribe need not toil to write a tied Get.</p>
<p class="bas indent1"><span class="nm">(d)</span><span class="cl">(Abaye):</span> R. Shimon ben Gamliel, R. Shimon and R. Elazar all hold that one (sometimes) tells a Shali'ach (agent) how to do something, but he does not mind if it is done differently.</p>
<p class="bas indent2"><span class="nm">1.</span>R. Shimon ben Gamliel - in our Mishnah;</p>
<p class="bas indent2"><span class="nm">2.</span><span class="cl">(Mishnah - R. Shimon):</span> (If Leah told a Shali'ach 'Shimon wants to be Mekadesh me with a silver Dinar. Go receive it for me',) if he received better than this (e.g. gold), she is Mekudeshes.</p>
<p class="bas indent2"><span class="nm">3.</span><span class="cl">R. Elazar - (Mishnah):</span> If Leah asked a Shali'ach 'receive my Get (of divorce) in Ploni (a certain place)', and he received it somewhere else, the Get is invalid (she wanted to be divorced only in Ploni);</p>
<p class="bas indent2"><span class="nm">4.</span>R. Elazar says, it is valid (she merely suggested where she thinks her husband is).</p>
<p class="bas subject"><span class="nm">2)</span>A GET WITH TOO FEW WITNESSES</p>
<p class="bas indent1"><span class="nm">(a)</span><span class="cl">(Mishnah):</span> A standard Get with only one witness...</p>
<p class="bas indent1"><span class="nm">(b)</span>We understand why the Mishnah must teach that a tied Get with only two witnesses is invalid;</p>
<p class="bas indent2"><span class="nm">1.</span>One might have thought that since two witnesses normally suffice, here also this is valid (b'Diavad). The Mishnah teaches that this is not so.</p>
<p class="bas indent1"><span class="nm">(c)</span><span class="cl">Question:</span> Why must it teach that a standard Get with only one witness is invalid?</p>
<p class="bas indent1"><span class="nm">(d)</span><span class="cl">Answer (Abaye):</span> This teaches that even if one witness signed and one witness testifies orally (in Beis Din) that the Get is valid, it is invalid.</p>
<p class="bas indent1"><span class="nm">(e)</span>Ameimar ruled that such a Get is valid.</p>
<p class="bas indent1"><span class="nm">(f)</span><span class="cl">Rav Ashi:</span> Abaye disqualifies such a Get!</p>
<p class="bas indent1"><span class="nm">(g)</span><span class="cl">Ameimar:</span> I disagree with Abaye.</p>
<p class="bas indent1"><span class="nm">(h)</span><span class="cl">Question:</span> How does Ameimar explain the Mishnah?</p>
<p class="bas bbbline">165b----------------------------------------165b</p>
<p class="bas indent1"><span class="nm">(i)</span><span class="cl">Answer:</span> The Mishnah teaches that a tied Get with only two witnesses is like a standard Get with only one witness: just like the latter is invalid mid'Oraisa, also the former.</p>
<p class="bas subject"><span class="nm">3)</span>THE QUESTION ASKED OF R. YIRMEYAH</p>
<p class="bas indent1"><span class="nm">(a)</span><span class="cl">Support - Version #1 - Question (Chachamim of Eretz Yisrael):</span> Do we combine the testimonies of one signed witness and one oral witness?</p>
<p class="bas indent2"><span class="nm">1.</span>According to Chachamim who argue with R. Yehoshua ben Korchah, who do not combine even two signed witnesses or two oral witnesses unless they saw the testimony together, and all the more so, one signed witness and one oral witness do not combine;</p>
<p class="bas indent2"><span class="nm">2.</span>They ask according to R. Yehoshua ben Korchah. Does he combine two signed witnesses <i>or</i> two oral witnesses, but not one signed witness and one oral witness?</p>
<p class="bas indent2"><span class="nm">3.</span>Or, even in this case, they combine?</p>
<p class="bas indent1"><span class="nm">(b)</span><span class="cl">Answer (R. Yirmeyah):</span> I believe that they combine.</p>
<p class="bas indent1"><span class="nm">(c)</span><span class="cl">Rejection (of support - Rav Ashi):</span> We learned a different version.</p>
<p class="bas indent1"><span class="nm">(d)</span><span class="cl">Version #2 - Question (Chachamim of Eretz Yisrael):</span> If two witnesses testified, each in a different Beis Din, may the Batei Din combine the testimonies?</p>
<p class="bas indent2"><span class="nm">1.</span>According to Chachamim who argue with R. Noson, even if they testified in one Beis Din they do not combine (unless they testified together), and all the more so if they testified in different Batei Din;</p>
<p class="bas indent2"><span class="nm">2.</span>They ask according to R. Noson. Does he combine two witnesses when they testified in one Beis Din, and not if they testified in two;</p>
<p class="bas indent2"><span class="nm">3.</span>Or, even in this case, they combine?</p>
<p class="bas indent1"><span class="nm">(e)</span><span class="cl">Answer (R. Yirmeyah):</span> I believe that they combine.</p>
<p class="bas indent1"><span class="nm">(f)</span><span class="cl">Version #3 (Mar bar Chiya) Question (Chachamim of Eretz Yisrael):</span> If two witnesses both testified in different Batei Din, may judges of the Batei Din combine to rule on the case?</p>
<p class="bas indent2"><span class="nm">1.</span>According to R. Noson, we join witnesses who did not testify together, and all the more so, we join judges (they are proficient);</p>
<p class="bas indent2"><span class="nm">2.</span>They ask according to Chachamim that argue with R. Noson. Does he say that we do not combine witnesses, but we combine judges;</p>
<p class="bas indent2"><span class="nm">3.</span>Or, even judges do not combine?</p>
<p class="bas indent1"><span class="nm">(g)</span><span class="cl">Answer (R. Yirmeyah):</span> I believe that they combine.</p>
<p class="bas indent1"><span class="nm">(h)</span><span class="cl">Version #4 (Ravina) Question (Chachamim of Eretz Yisrael):</span> If three judges sat to validate a document and one of them died, must the other judges write (in the validation) 'three of us sat, and one died'?</p>
<p class="bas indent1"><span class="nm">(i)</span><span class="cl">Answer (R. Yirmeyah):</span> I believe that they must write this. (end of Version #4)</p>
<p class="bas indent1"><span class="nm">(j)</span>After this answer, R. Yirmeyah was allowed to enter the Beis Medrash again. (He had been expelled for asking a question that showed skepticism about a teaching of Chachamim.)</p>
<p class="bas subject"><span class="nm">4)</span>VAGUE EXPRESSIONS IN A DOCUMENT</p>
<p class="bas indent1"><span class="nm">(a)</span><span class="cl">(Mishnah):</span> If a document says '100 Zuz, that are 20 Sela'im (which is 80 Zuz)'. the bearer collects only 20 Sela'im;</p>
<p class="bas indent2"><span class="nm">1.</span>If it says '100 Zuz, that are 30 Sela'im', the bearer only collects 100 Zuz;</p>
<p class="bas indent1"><span class="nm">(b)</span>If it says 'Kesef Sela'im (or Darkonos), that are...' and the number was erased, we know it was at least two.</p>
<p class="bas indent1"><span class="nm">(c)</span>If it says '100 Zuz' above (in the main text), and it says 200 below (in the recap of the document), or vice-versa, we follow what is written below.</p>
<p class="bas indent1"><span class="nm">(d)</span><span class="cl">Question:</span> If so, why do we write the top?</p>
<p class="bas indent1"><span class="nm">(e)</span><span class="cl">Answer:</span> If a letter is erased from the bottom, we can learn from the top.</p>
<p class="bas indent1"><span class="nm">(f)</span><span class="cl">(Gemara - Beraisa):</span> 'Kesef' refers to at least one silver Dinar;</p>

<p class="bas indent1"><span class="nm">(i)</span><span class="cl">Question:</span> Perhaps it means Perutos!</p>
<p class="bas indent1"><span class="nm">(j)</span><span class="cl">Answer (Rav Papa):</span> It is in a place where they do not make silver Perutos.</p>
