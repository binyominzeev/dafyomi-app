<div class="subject"><span class="nm">1)</span><p>MAY ONE BE ME'AREV WITH BEETS?</p></div>
<div class="indent1"><span class="nm">(a)</span><p><span class="cl">Version #1 (Rav Hamnuna):</span> One may be Me'arev with raw beets.</p></div>
<div class="indent1"><span class="nm">(b)</span><p><span class="cl">Question:</span> Rav Chisda taught that raw beets kill a healthy person!</p></div>
<div class="indent1"><span class="nm">(c)</span><p><span class="cl">Answer:</span> He means that half-cooked beets kill a healthy person.</p></div>
<div class="indent1"><span class="nm">(d)</span><p><span class="cl">Version #2 (Rav Hamnuna):</span> One may not be Me'arev with raw beets, for Rav Chisda taught that raw beets kill a healthy person.</p></div>
<div class="indent1"><span class="nm">(e)</span><p><span class="cl">Question:</span> We see that people eat them and do not die from them!</p></div>
<div class="indent1"><span class="nm">(f)</span><p><span class="cl">Answer:</span> Rav Hamnuna and Rav Chisda refer to half-cooked beets. (end of Version #2)</p></div>
<div class="indent1"><span class="nm">(g)</span><p><span class="cl">(Rav Chisda):</span> A cooked beet dish is good for the heart and eyes, and all the more so for the intestines;</p></div>
<div class="indent1"><span class="nm">(h)</span><p><span class="cl">(Abaye):</span> This is only if it totally dried out through cooking, to the point that it dissolves and makes noise when it is boiled.</p></div>
<div class="subject"><span class="nm">2)</span><p>SHI'URIM FOR AN ERUV</p></div>
<div class="indent1"><span class="nm">(a)</span><p><span class="cl">(Rava):</span> [Today] I am ready to answer any question, like Ben Azai in the market of Tiverya. (Normally, one may ask only about the matter being learned.)</p></div>
<div class="indent1"><span class="nm">(b)</span><p><span class="cl">Question:</span> What is the Shi'ur of apples for an Eruv?</p></div>
<div class="indent2"><span class="nm">1.</span><p><span class="cl">Objection (Rava):</span> One may not be Me'arev with apples!</p></div>
<div class="indent2"><span class="nm">2.</span><p><span class="cl">Question (against Rava - Mishnah):</span> All foods join for the following:</p></div>
<div class="indent3"><span class="nm">i.</span><p>To be Metamei [mid'Rabanan] one who eats the volume of a half-loaf (Rashi - two eggs; Rambam - one and a half eggs) of Tamei food;</p></div>
<div class="indent3"><span class="nm">ii.</span><p>To the Shi'ur of two meals for an Eruv;</p></div>
<div class="indent3"><span class="nm">iii.</span><p>To the Shi'ur of an egg for Tum'as Ochlim (to be Metamei other foods. Some hold that it is the Shi'ur to receive Tum'ah mid'Oraisa, or to receive Hechsher. I.e. food is not Mekabel Tum'ah until it is wet through one of the seven liquids.)</p></div>
<div class="indent3"><span class="nm">iv.</span><p><span class="cl">Question:</span> This is not difficult. Even though it says 'all foods', and apples are a food, R. Yochanan taught that we do not learn from a Klal, even if it says 'except'.</p></div>
<div class="indent3"><span class="nm">v.</span><p><span class="cl">Answer:</span> Eruv was taught with Tum'as Ochlim. This implies that it applies to everything that receives Tum'as Ochlim. Apples receive Tum'as Ochlim. (Rava is refuted.)</p></div>
<div class="indent1"><span class="nm">(c)</span><p><span class="cl">Question:</span> [We still did not answer] what is the Shi'ur of apples for an Eruv?</p></div>
<div class="indent1"><span class="nm">(d)</span><p><span class="cl">Answer (Rav Nachman):</span> It is one Kav (about two liters).</p></div>
<div class="indent1"><span class="nm">(e)</span><p><span class="cl">Question (Beraisa - R. Shimon ben Elazar):</span> The minimal Shi'urim of Ma'aser Oni that one may give to an Oni (the amount for two meals) are:</p></div>
<div class="indent2"><span class="nm">1.</span><p>Half a Revi'is (about a 16th of a liter) of spices; a Log (half-liter) of vegetables; 10 nuts; five peaches; two pomegranates; and one Esrog.</p></div>
<div class="indent2"><span class="nm">2.</span><p><span class="cl">(Gursak citing Rav Menasiya citing Rav):</span> The same Shi'urim apply to an Eruv.</p></div>
<div class="indent2"><span class="nm">3.</span><p>The Shi'ur for apples should be the same as for peaches!</p></div>
<div class="indent1"><span class="nm">(f)</span><p><span class="cl">Answer:</span> Peaches are more important than apples. (They are appropriate for dessert. Therefore, the Shi'ur for dessert for two meals suffices.)</p></div>
<div class="indent1"><span class="nm">(g)</span><p><span class="cl">Rav Yosef:</span> May Hash-m forgive Rav Menasiya for his mistake! I taught this to him regarding the following Mishnah, and he repeated it regarding the Beraisa!</p></div>
<div class="indent2"><span class="nm">1.</span><p><span class="cl">(Mishnah):</span> The following are the minimal Shi'urim for Ma'aser Oni - half a Kav of wheat, or a Kav of barley, one and a half Kavim of spelt, a Kav of dried figs, a Maneh (the weight of 9600 barley seeds) of figs pressed into rings, a half Log of wine, and a Revi'is of oil;</p></div>
<div class="indent2"><span class="nm">2.</span><p>R. Meir says, the Shi'ur for barley is half a Kav;</p></div>
<div class="indent2"><span class="nm">3.</span><p>R. Akiva says, the Shi'urim for pressed figs, wine and oil are half a Maneh, a Revi'is, and half a Revi'is, respectively.</p></div>
<div class="indent2"><span class="nm">4.</span><p>Aba Sha'ul says, the Shi'ur for other produce is enough to sell and buy food for two meals.</p></div>
<div class="indent2"><span class="nm">5.</span><p><span class="cl">(Rav):</span> The same applies to Eruv.</p></div>
<div class="indent1"><span class="nm">(h)</span><p><span class="cl">Version #1 (Rashi) Question:</span> What difference does it make if Rav said this about the Mishnah or the Beraisa? (Presumably, it applies to both!)</p></div>
<div class="indent1"><span class="nm">(i)</span><p><span class="cl">Version #2 (Tosfos) Question:</span> (Rav Yosef did not explicitly hear that Rav said this about the Mishnah.) Why was he so sure that Rav discusses the Mishnah, and not the Beraisa! (end of Version #2)</p></div>
<div class="indent2"><span class="nm">1.</span><p><span class="cl">Suggestion:</span> The Beraisa discusses spices, which are not eaten [by themselves. Rav Yosef holds that they are invalid for an Eruv.]</p></div>
<div class="indent2"><span class="nm">2.</span><p><span class="cl">Rejection:</span> Likewise, the Mishnah discusses wheat and barley, which are not eaten [until they are cooked or baked]!</p></div>
<div class="indent1"><span class="nm">(j)</span><p><span class="cl">Answer:</span> Rav explicitly said that half a Log of wine is the Shi'ur for Eruv. If he requires so much (Ritva - even though a Revi'is is an important Shi'ur), surely, he learned this from the Mishnah!</p></div>
<div class="indent1"><span class="nm">(k)</span><p><span class="cl">(Mishnah):</span> All foods join... to the Shi'ur of two meals for an Eruv.</p></div>
<div class="indent1"><span class="nm">(l)</span><p><span class="cl">(Rav Yosef):</span> There must be a meal of each [of two foods. Many foods do not join.]</p></div>
<div class="indent1"><span class="nm">(m)</span><p><span class="cl">(Rabah):</span> There can even be a half, third or quarter [meal of a food. Many different foods join.]</p></div>
<div class="indent1"><span class="nm">(n)</span><p><span class="cl">(Rav):</span> Half a Log of wine is the Shi'ur for Eruv.</p></div>
<div class="indent1"><span class="nm">(o)</span><p><span class="cl">Question:</span> We do not need so much!</p></div>
<div class="indent2"><span class="nm">1.</span><p><span class="cl">(Beraisa - R. Shimon ben Elazar):</span> The Shi'urim for an Eruv are:</p></div>
<div class="indent3"><span class="nm">i.</span><p>Wine - enough to accompany his food (i.e. to soak bread for two meals). Vinegar - enough to dip [for two meals, i.e. a Revi'is]. Olives or onions - the amount to accompany bread [for two meals].</p></div>
<div class="indent1"><span class="nm">(p)</span><p><span class="cl">Answer:</span> The Beraisa refers to cooked wine. (It is a good accompaniment for bread.)</p></div>
<div class="indent1"><span class="nm">(q)</span><p><span class="cl">(Beraisa):</span> The Shi'ur for vinegar is enough to dip.</p></div>
<div class="indent1"><span class="nm">(r)</span><p><span class="cl">Version #1 (Rav Gidal):</span> This means enough to dip for two meals consisting of vegetables.</p></div>
<div class="indent1"><span class="nm">(s)</span><p><span class="cl">Version #2 (Rav Gidal):</span> This means enough to dip vegetables eaten in two [bread] meals. (end of Version #2)</p></div>
<div class="subject"><span class="nm">3)</span><p>EATING ONIONS</p></div>
<div class="indent1"><span class="nm">(a)</span><p><span class="cl">(Beraisa):</span> The Shi'ur for olives or onions is the amount to accompany bread [for two meals].</p></div>
<div class="indent1"><span class="nm">(b)</span><p><span class="cl">Question:</span> One may not be Me'arev with onions!</p></div>
<div class="indent2"><span class="nm">1.</span><p><span class="cl">(Beraisa - R. Shimon ben Elazar):</span> Once, I spent Shabbos with R. Meir. A man said that he relied on an Eruv Techumim of onions to come from another city. R. Meir ruled that he may not leave the four Amos he stands in (the Eruv was invalid).</p></div>
<div class="indent1"><span class="nm">(c)</span><p><span class="cl">Answer:</span> An Eruv with onion leaves is invalid (one may not eat them), but an Eruv with onion bulbs is valid.</p></div>
<div class="indent2"><span class="nm">1.</span><p><span class="cl">(Beraisa):</span> If one ate onions and died the next morning, surely they killed him.</p></div>
<div class="indent2"><span class="nm">2.</span><p><span class="cl">(Shmuel):</span> This refers to onion leaves. There is no problem with bulbs.</p></div>
<div class="indent1"><span class="nm">(d)</span><p>Even the leaves are problematic only if the leaves did not grow to be a Zeres (the distance one can separate his pinky and thumb). If they did, they are fine.</p></div>
<div class="bbbline">29b----------------------------------------29b</p></div>
<div class="indent1"><span class="nm">(e)</span><p><span class="cl">(Rav Papa):</span> It is a problem only if he did not drink beer. If he did, this is no problem. (Presumably, one may be Me'arev with the leaves and beer, for one may consume both. Surely, the Eruv R. Meir disqualified consisted only of leaves - <b>PF</b>.)</p></div>
<div class="indent1"><span class="nm">(f)</span><p><span class="cl">(Beraisa):</span> One may not eat onions because it has Nachash (Rashi - venom; R. Chananel - a stalk whose end looks like a snake's head) inside;</p></div>
<div class="indent1"><span class="nm">(g)</span><p>A case occurred in which R. Chanina ate half an onion with half the Nachash inside. He fell sick and was about to die;</p></div>
<div class="indent2"><span class="nm">1.</span><p>His colleagues prayed for him (Ritva - even though he was Chayav Misah for transgressing Divrei Chachamim) and he recovered, because he was needed.</p></div>
<div class="subject"><span class="nm">4)</span><p>SHI'URIM FOR VARIOUS FOODS</p></div>
<div class="indent1"><span class="nm">(a)</span><p><span class="cl">(R. Zeira):</span> One may be Me'arev with beer. If three Lugim of beer fall into an [incomplete] Mikveh, they disqualify it [like Mayim She'uvim, i.e. water that was in a Kli].</p></div>
<div class="indent1"><span class="nm">(b)</span><p><span class="cl">Question (Rav Kahana):</span> Obviously, they disqualify a Mikveh! Why should it be different than dye water?</p></div>
<div class="indent2"><span class="nm">1.</span><p><span class="cl">(Mishnah - R. Yosi):</span> If three Lugim of dye water fell into a Mikveh, they disqualify it.</p></div>
<div class="indent1"><span class="nm">(c)</span><p><span class="cl">Answer:</span> Since it is called dye <i>water</i>, the decree of Mayim She'uvim applies. One might have thought that beer does not Posel, since it is not called water. Rav Kahana teaches that this is not so.</p></div>
<div class="indent1"><span class="nm">(d)</span><p><span class="cl">Question:</span> How much beer is needed for an Eruv?</p></div>
<div class="indent1"><span class="nm">(e)</span><p><span class="cl">Answer #1 (Rav Acha brei d'Rav Yosef):</span> Two Lugim are required:</p></div>
<div class="indent2"><span class="nm">1.</span><p><span class="cl">(Mishnah):</span> On Shabbos, if one was Motzi any of the following [from Reshus ha'Yachid to Reshus ha'Rabim, he is liable] - enough [raw, i.e. undiluted] wine to mix [with water] to fill a cup...</p></div>
<div class="indent2"><span class="nm">2.</span><p><span class="cl">(Beraisa):</span> This is the amount of wine to mix a nice cup.</p></div>
<div class="indent2"><span class="nm">3.</span><p><span class="cl">Question:</span> What is this?</p></div>
<div class="indent2"><span class="nm">4.</span><p><span class="cl">Answer:</span> It is the Kos of Berachah [over which we say Birkas ha'Mazon].</p></div>
<div class="indent2"><span class="nm">5.</span><p><span class="cl">(Rav Nachman):</span> One must put a quarter Revi'is of [raw] wine in the Kos of Berachah, so that after it is mixed there will be a Revi'is.</p></div>
<div class="indent2"><span class="nm">6.</span><p><span class="cl">(Rava):</span> If one measure of [raw] wine cannot be mixed with three measures of water (the mixture will be too weak), the wine is substandard.</p></div>
<div class="indent2"><span class="nm">7.</span><p><span class="cl">(Seifa of Mishnah):</span> The Shi'ur for all other liquids, including wastewater, is a Revi'is.</p></div>
<div class="indent2"><span class="nm">8.</span><p><span class="cl">Inference:</span> Just like the Shi'ur for Hotza'ah of beer is [a Revi'is,] four times the Shi'ur for wine, also the Shi'ur for an Eruv of beer is four times that of wine!</p></div>
<div class="indent1"><span class="nm">(f)</span><p><span class="cl">Rejection:</span> No, the Shi'ur Hotza'ah of beer is a Revi'is, because less is unimportant. The Shi'ur for an Eruv is less than two Lugim, since one cup (a Revi'is) in the morning and one in the evening sustain a person! (This is like two meals.)</p></div>
<div class="indent1"><span class="nm">(g)</span><p><span class="cl">Question:</span> What is the Shi'ur of dates for an Eruv?</p></div>
<div class="indent1"><span class="nm">(h)</span><p><span class="cl">Answer (Rav Yosef):</span> It is a Kav.</p></div>
<div class="indent1"><span class="nm">(i)</span><p><span class="cl">Rav Yosef:</span> A Beraisa shows that the Shi'ur is [at most] a Kav:</p></div>
<div class="indent2"><span class="nm">1.</span><p><span class="cl">(Beraisa):</span> If a non-Kohen ate dry figs [of Terumah, b'Shogeg] and paid with dates, he will be blessed!</p></div>
<div class="indent2"><span class="nm">2.</span><p><span class="cl">Question:</span> What is the case? (Tana'im argue about whether the payment is according to the volume of what he ate or its value.)</p></div>
<div class="indent3"><span class="nm">i.</span><p>If [the Tana holds that] he pays according to the value, why is he blessed? (He was obligated to pay this much!)</p></div>
<div class="indent2"><span class="nm">3.</span><p><span class="cl">Answer #1:</span> [The Tana holds that] he pays according to volume. [He is blessed for choosing to give] dates [because they] are worth four times as much!</p></div>
<div class="indent2"><span class="nm">4.</span><p>This shows that dates are better than dried figs. (Since a Kav suffices for dried figs (Beraisa 29a), all the more so it suffices for dates!)</p></div>
<div class="indent1"><span class="nm">(j)</span><p><span class="cl">Rejection (and Answer #2 to Question (1) - Abaye):</span> Really, he pays according to the value;</p></div>
<div class="indent2"><span class="nm">1.</span><p>He is blessed because he ate something that people are not eager to buy, and paid with something that people are eager to buy.</p></div>
<div class="indent1"><span class="nm">(k)</span><p><span class="cl">(Rav Acha bar Pinchas):</span> The Shi'ur for Shesisa (it is made with flour ground from parched grain; honey is added) is two spoonfuls;</p></div>
<div class="indent1"><span class="nm">(l)</span><p><span class="cl">(Abaye):</span> The Shi'ur for parched grain is two Bunim (a certain measure) of Pumbadisa.</p></div>
<div class="indent1"><span class="nm">(m)</span><p><span class="cl">(Abaye):</span> My [surrogate] mother told me that parched grain is good for the heart and removes worry.</p></div>
<div class="indent1"><span class="nm">(n)</span><p><span class="cl">(Abaye):</span> My mother told me that if one's heart is weak, he should take meat from the right thigh of a ram, and eat it roasted in coals of cattle excrement [or willow twigs], and drink mixed wine afterwards.</p></div>
<div class="subject"><span class="nm">5)</span><p>THE SHI'UR FOR A CONDIMENT</p></div>
<div class="indent1"><span class="nm">(a)</span><p><span class="cl">(Rav Yehudah):</span> The Shi'ur for any condiment that is eaten with bread is enough to accompany bread for two meals. The Shi'ur for anything else is enough to eat two meals of it;</p></div>
<div class="indent1"><span class="nm">(b)</span><p>The Shi'ur for Chai (raw) meat is enough to eat two meals of it. (Rashba - it is salted (Yerushalmi), for if not, most people would not eat it. Ritva - alternatively, Chai means half-cooked, like we say regarding Ben Sorer u'Moreh.)</p></div>
<div class="indent1"><span class="nm">(c)</span><p><span class="cl">(Rabah):</span> The Shi'ur for roasted meat is enough to eat with two meals of bread. (He holds that it is an accompaniment);</p></div>
<div class="indent1"><span class="nm">(d)</span><p><span class="cl">(Rav Yosef):</span> The Shi'ur is enough to eat two meals of it.</p></div>
<div class="indent1"><span class="nm">(e)</span><p><span class="cl">Support (Rav Yosef, for himself):</span> Persians eat roasted meat without bread. (Ritva - if above, Chai means raw salted meat, here we discuss half-roasted meat.)</p></div>
