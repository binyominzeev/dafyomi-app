<p class="bas subject"><span class="nm">1)</span>'BITUL' OF IDOLATRY</p>
<p class="bas indent1"><span class="nm">(a)</span><span class="cl">Version #3 (Beraisa - R. Shimon ben Menasiya):</span> Idolatry of a Yisrael can never be Batel.</p>
<p class="bas indent1"><span class="nm">(b)</span><span class="cl">Question:</span> What does 'never' come to include?</p>
<p class="bas indent1"><span class="nm">(c)</span><span class="cl">Answer (R. Hilel brei d'R. Vilas):</span> Even if the Nochri is a partner in the idolatry, he cannot be Mevatel the Yisrael's share;</p>
<p class="bas indent2"><span class="nm">1.</span>This is because a Yisrael serves according to his own will.</p>
<p class="bas indent1"><span class="nm">(d)</span><span class="cl">(Mishnah):</span> The following are Bitul of idolatry - cutting off the top of the ear, nose or finger, or bashing it (even though nothing is cut off).</p>
<p class="bas indent1"><span class="nm">(e)</span>The following are not Bitul - spitting or urinating in front of it, dragging it in mud, or throwing excrement at it.</p>
<p class="bas indent1"><span class="nm">(f)</span>Rebbi says, if he sold it or gave it for collateral for a loan, it is Batel;</p>
<p class="bas indent1"><span class="nm">(g)</span>Chachamim say, it is not Batel.</p>
<p class="bas indent1"><span class="nm">(h)</span><span class="cl">(Gemara) Question:</span> When he bashes it, why is it Batel?</p>
<p class="bas indent1"><span class="nm">(i)</span><span class="cl">Answer (R. Zeira):</span> He bashed in its face.</p>
<p class="bas indent1"><span class="nm">(j)</span><span class="cl">Question:</span> What is the source that spitting or urinating in front of it is not Bitul?</p>
<p class="bas indent1"><span class="nm">(k)</span><span class="cl">Answer (Chizkiyah):</span> "Ki Yir'av v'Hiskatzaf v'Kilel b'Malko u'Veilohav u'Fanah l'Ma'alah" - after cursing his idol and turning his heart to Hash-m, "v'El Eretz Yabit", he will return to his idol.</p>
<p class="bas indent1"><span class="nm">(l)</span><span class="cl">(Mishnah - Rebbi):</span> If he sold it or gave it for collateral for a loan, it is Batel...</p>
<p class="bas indent1"><span class="nm">(m)</span><span class="cl">(Opinion #1 - Ze'iri or R. Yirmeyah bar Aba):</span> They argue in a case that he sold it to a Nochri smelter. All agree that selling to a Yisrael smelter (Rashi - the same applies to any Yisrael) is Bitul;</p>
<p class="bas indent1"><span class="nm">(n)</span><span class="cl">(Opinion #2 - the other of Ze'iri and R. Yirmeyah bar Aba):</span> They argue in a case that he sold it to a Yisrael smelter.</p>
<p class="bas indent1"><span class="nm">(o)</span><span class="cl">Question:</span> Does opinion #2 say that they argue also about one who sold to a Nochri smelter, or do all agree that selling to a Nochri smelter is not Bitul?</p>
<p class="bas indent1"><span class="nm">(p)</span><span class="cl">Answer (Beraisa - Rebbi):</span> My opinion seems correct when he sold it to be destroyed. Chachamim's opinion seems correct when he sold it to be Ne'evad.</p>
<p class="bas indent2"><span class="nm">1.</span><span class="cl">Question:</span> What does it mean 'to be destroyed' and 'to be Ne'evad'?</p>
<p class="bas indent3"><span class="nm">i.</span><span class="cl">Suggestion:</span> He sold it on condition that the buyer will destroy it or serve it.</p>
<p class="bas indent3"><span class="nm">ii.</span><span class="cl">Rejection:</span> Surely, all agree that the former is Bitul, and the latter is not!</p>
<p class="bas indent2"><span class="nm">2.</span><span class="cl">Answer:</span> Rather, 'to be destroyed' means selling to one who will destroy it, i.e. a Yisrael smelter. 'To be Ne'evad' means selling to one who will serve it, i.e. a Nochri smelter. (They argue in both cases!)</p>
<p class="bas indent1"><span class="nm">(q)</span><span class="cl">Rejection:</span> No, Rebbi means, my opinion seems correct <i>to Chachamim</i> (i.e. they agree with me) when he sold it to be destroyed, i.e. a Yisrael smelter. They argue only in a case that he sold it to be Ne'evad, i.e. to a Nochri smelter.</p>
<p class="bas indent1"><span class="nm">(r)</span><span class="cl">Question (against Opinion #1 - Beraisa):</span> If a Yisrael bought scrap metal from a Nochri, and found idolatry among it:</p>
<p class="bas indent2"><span class="nm">1.</span>If he did Meshichah but did not yet give the money, he can return it (it was a mistaken sale);</p>
<p class="bas indent2"><span class="nm">2.</span>If he did Meshichah after giving the money, he must cast the idolatry to the Dead Sea. (Even though it was a mistaken sale, which is void, if he asks for his money back, it <i>looks like</i> he sells back the idolatry.)</p>
<p class="bas indent2"><span class="nm">3.</span>Granted, according to Opinion #2, the Beraisa is Chachamim, who say that selling to a Yisrael smelter is not Bitul.</p>
<p class="bas indent2"><span class="nm">4.</span>However, according to Opinion #1, all agree that selling to a Yisrael smelter is Bitul. Which Tana forbids to return it?</p>
<p class="bas indent1"><span class="nm">(s)</span><span class="cl">Answer:</span> All agree that this sale was not Batel, because the Nochri did not know that idolatry was among the metal.</p>
<p class="bas subject"><span class="nm">2)</span>WHEN IS A 'NOCHRI' 'MEVATEL'?</p>
<p class="bas indent1"><span class="nm">(a)</span><span class="cl">(Beraisa):</span> The following are not Bitul - the owner gave it as collateral for a loan, a house collapsed on it (and he did not try to uncover it), or robbers took it (and he did not try to recover it);</p>
<p class="bas indent1"><span class="nm">(b)</span>If he went abroad and left it, if he will return, like in the war with Yehoshua, it is not Batel.</p>
<p class="bas bbbline">53b----------------------------------------53b</p>
<p class="bas indent1"><span class="nm">(c)</span>The Tana needed to teach all these cases.</p>
<p class="bas indent2"><span class="nm">1.</span>Had he taught only about when he gave it as collateral, one might have thought that this is not Bitul because he did not sell it, but when a house collapsed on it, since he did not try to uncover it, it is Batel;</p>
<p class="bas indent2"><span class="nm">2.</span>Had he taught only about when a house collapsed on it, one might have thought this is not Bitul because it is there whenever he wants to uncover it, but when robbers took it, since he did not try to recover it, it is Batel.</p>
<p class="bas indent2"><span class="nm">3.</span>Had he taught only about when robbers took it, one might have thought that here, he expects that it will still be Ne'evad;</p>
<p class="bas indent3"><span class="nm">i.</span>If Nochrim took it, they will serve it;</p>
<p class="bas indent3"><span class="nm">ii.</span>If Yisraelim took it, they will sell it to Nochrim because it is valuable for an idol.</p>
<p class="bas indent2"><span class="nm">4.</span>However, when he went abroad, since he did not take it with him, this is Bitul;</p>
<p class="bas indent2"><span class="nm">5.</span>The Beraisa teaches that none of these cases are Bitul.</p>
<p class="bas indent1"><span class="nm">(d)</span><span class="cl">Question:</span> The Beraisa said 'if he will return, like in the war with Yehoshua... ' The Nochrim did not return from that war!</p>
<p class="bas indent1"><span class="nm">(e)</span><span class="cl">Answer:</span> It means, if he will return, it is forbidden like idolatry taken in Yehoshua's conquest of Eretz Yisrael (because the Kena'anim <i>expected</i> to return).</p>
<p class="bas indent1"><span class="nm">(f)</span><span class="cl">Question:</span> Why did the Tana compare this to Yehoshua's war (and not say the law directly)?</p>
<p class="bas indent1"><span class="nm">(g)</span><span class="cl">Answer:</span> He alludes to Rav Yehudah's law;</p>
<p class="bas indent2"><span class="nm">1.</span><span class="cl">(Rav Yehudah):</span> If a Yisrael erected a brick and never bowed to it, but a Nochri bowed to it, it is forbidden.</p>
<p class="bas indent1"><span class="nm">(h)</span><span class="cl">Question:</span> What is the source that the Nochri forbids it?</p>
<p class="bas indent1"><span class="nm">(i)</span><span class="cl">Answer (R. Elazar):</span> We learn from the conquest of Eretz Yisrael. The Torah commanded "va'Ashereihem Tisrefun ba'Esh";</p>
<p class="bas indent2"><span class="nm">1.</span><span class="cl">Question:</span> Why were the Asheiros forbidden? Eretz Yisrael belonged to the Avos. One (a Nochri) cannot forbid what he does not own!</p>
<p class="bas indent3"><span class="nm">i.</span>We cannot say that only the Asheiros from before the Avos were forbidden. The Torah would not command to burn them, for one could (force a Nochri to) Mevatel them!</p>
<p class="bas indent2"><span class="nm">2.</span><span class="cl">Answer:</span> We must say that when Yisrael served the Egel, they showed that they approve of idolatry, and consented to Nochri worship of Asheiros in Eretz Yisrael (therefore, they became forbidden).</p>
<p class="bas indent2"><span class="nm">3.</span><span class="cl">Question:</span> Perhaps Yisrael served the Egel, but did not approve of other idolatry!</p>
<p class="bas indent2"><span class="nm">4.</span><span class="cl">Answer:</span> "Eleh Elohecha Yisrael" - they desired many gods.</p>
<p class="bas indent2"><span class="nm">5.</span><span class="cl">Question:</span> Only Asheiros served at that time should be forbidden, but not those served after (Yisrael repented)!</p>
<p class="bas indent2"><span class="nm">6.</span><span class="cl">Answer:</span> Correct! However, we do not know when they were served, so all must be burned. Melo ha'Ro'im asks why we do not follow the majority, which presumably were not worshipped at that time. Seemingly, a tree planted after the Egel should be permitted. Perhaps we are concerned lest a branch of a forbidden Asherah was planted in the ground, and this tree resulted - Beni Betzalel Feldman she'Yichyeh</p>
<p class="bas subject"><span class="nm">3)</span>BASES FOR IDOLATRY</p>
<p class="bas indent1"><span class="nm">(a)</span><span class="cl">(Mishnah):</span> If a Nochri abandoned his idolatry in peacetime, it is permitted. If he abandoned it in wartime, it is forbidden.</p>
<p class="bas indent1"><span class="nm">(b)</span>Bimusi'os (bases on which to put idolatry) of kings are permitted, for they put idolatry on them when the king passes (this will be explained).</p>
<p class="bas indent1"><span class="nm">(c)</span><span class="cl">(Gemara - R. Yirmeyah bar Aba):</span> The tower that Nimrod built is like idolatry abandoned in peacetime. It is permitted.</p>
<p class="bas indent2"><span class="nm">1.</span>Even though Hash-m dispersed everyone, they could have returned to it if they wanted;</p>
<p class="bas indent2"><span class="nm">2.</span>Since they did not return, this shows that they were Mevatel it.</p>
<p class="bas indent1"><span class="nm">(d)</span><span class="cl">(Mishnah):</span> Bimusi'os of kings are permitted.</p>
<p class="bas indent1"><span class="nm">(e)</span><span class="cl">Question:</span> The fact that they put idolatry on them when the king passes is no reason to permit them!</p>
<p class="bas indent1"><span class="nm">(f)</span><span class="cl">Answer (Rabah bar bar Chanah):</span> It means, because the Bimusi'os were only set up to put idolatry on them for the king to serve when he passes, and the king often chooses another path (because he has no desire to serve it), they are Mevatel them.</p>
<p class="bas indent1"><span class="nm">(g)</span>Ula sat on a dented Bimus (a piece had come off).</p>
<p class="bas indent1"><span class="nm">(h)</span><span class="cl">Rav Yehudah:</span> Rav and Shmuel taught that a dented Bimus is forbidden!</p>
<p class="bas indent2"><span class="nm">1.</span>Even the opinion that permits broken idolatry, he permits it only because people do not serve broken idolatry, it is a disgrace;</p>
<p class="bas indent2"><span class="nm">2.</span>People do not care if the Bimus on which they put idolatry is broken.</p>
<p class="bas indent1"><span class="nm">(i)</span><span class="cl">Ula:</span> We greatly revere Rav and Shmuel, but the Halachah follows R. Yochanan and Reish Lakish, who permit a dented Bimus.</p>
<p class="bas indent2"><span class="nm">1.</span>Even the opinion that forbids broken idolatry, he forbids only it because people do not Mevatel broken idolatry, for it is a disgrace;</p>
<p class="bas indent2"><span class="nm">2.</span>People have no qualms about discarding a broken Bimus and erecting a new one.</p>
<p class="bas indent1"><span class="nm">(j)</span><span class="cl">Support (for R. Yochanan and Reish Lakish - Beraisa):</span> A dented Bimus is permitted. A dented Mizbe'ach is forbidden, until the majority breaks off.</p>
<p class="bas indent1"><span class="nm">(k)</span><span class="cl">Question:</span> What is the difference between a Bimus and a Mizbe'ach?</p>
<p class="bas indent1"><span class="nm">(l)</span><span class="cl">Answer (R. Yakov bar Idi):</span> A Bimus is one stone. A Mizbe'ach is made of many stones.</p>
