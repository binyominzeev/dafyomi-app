<div class="subject"><span class="nm">1)</span><p>PARTS OF A BED BEING MEKABEL TUM'AH</p></div>
<div class="indent1"><span class="nm">(a)</span><p><span class="cl">Question:</span> In what Mishnah do we find the position of R. Chanan citing Rebbi?</p></div>
<div class="indent1"><span class="nm">(b)</span><p><span class="cl">Answer:</span> It is a qualification of Chachamim in the Mishnah in Kelim dealing with the Tum'ah and Taharah of parts of a bed.</p></div>
<div class="indent2"><span class="nm">1.</span><p><span class="cl">(R. Eliezer):</span> Only a complete bed is subject to Tum'ah.</p></div>
<div class="indent2"><span class="nm">2.</span><p><span class="cl">(Chachamim):</span> Sections of it can become Tamei (and Tahor) independently.</p></div>
<div class="indent2"><span class="nm">3.</span><p><span class="cl">Question:</span> In what manner will parts be Tameh according to Chachamim?</p></div>
<div class="indent2"><span class="nm">4.</span><p><span class="cl">Answer (R. Chanan citing Rebbi):</span> Such as one length of bed with its two legs, or one width with its two legs.</p></div>
<div class="indent3"><span class="nm">i.</span><p><span class="cl">Question:</span> What is that good for?</p></div>
<div class="indent3"><span class="nm">ii.</span><p><span class="cl">Answer:</span> One can attach ropes to it and then lean it against the wall and sleep on it.</p></div>
<div class="subject"><span class="nm">2)</span><p>WORN OUT KELIM</p></div>
<div class="indent1"><span class="nm">(a)</span><p><span class="cl">Question:</span> What are the worn out Kelim which R. Ami b. Tivyumi referred to as being Sechach Pasul?</p></div>
<div class="indent1"><span class="nm">(b)</span><p><span class="cl">Answer:</span> Clothes of less than the minimum size garment (3x3 Etzba'os).</p></div>
<div class="indent1"><span class="nm">(c)</span><p>The Beraisa which invalidates the worn out grass mats from being Sechach supports R. Ami b. Tivyumi (parenthetically, a large mat which was made as Sechach is Kosher while a smaller mat, made for sleeping, is not valid as Sechach.</p></div>
<div class="subject"><span class="nm">3)</span><p>A SUKAH CUT FROM WITHIN A HAYSTACK</p></div>
<div class="indent1"><span class="nm">(a)</span><p><span class="cl">(R. Huna):</span> The Pesul of the Mishnah is only if there is no Tefach-deep (and 7x7 Tefachim large) hole.</p></div>
<div class="indent2"><span class="nm">1.</span><p>If there already is such a hole in the haystack, an Ohel already exists for the entire area of the Sukah.</p></div>
<div class="indent2"><span class="nm">2.</span><p>It is then permitted to extend the height of the walls from one Tefach to ten.</p></div>
<div class="indent1"><span class="nm">(b)</span><p>This ruling is supported by being the resolution to a contradiction between our Mishnah and a Beraisa.</p></div>
<div class="indent2"><span class="nm">1.</span><p>One Beraisa permits a Sukah cut from within a haystack, while our Mishnah forbids it.</p></div>
<div class="indent2"><span class="nm">2.</span><p>The resolution is the ruling of R. Huna, and the Beraisa speaks of a case where a one-Tefach hole already exists.</p></div>
<div class="indent1"><span class="nm">(c)</span><p>Others learn the ruling of R. Huna as having been taught in order to resolve this contradiction (and not having the contradiction being brought as a support to his prior ruling).</p></div>
<div class="subject"><span class="nm">4)</span><p>MISHNAH: SPACE AT THE BOTTOM OR TOP OF THE WALLS</p></div>
<div class="indent1"><span class="nm">(a)</span><p><span class="cl">(Tana Kama):</span> A wall of a Sukah which is woven from the top down is Kosher only if it reaches to within at least three Tefachim from the ground (Lavud).</p></div>
<div class="indent1"><span class="nm">(b)</span><p>A wall which begins from the ground is Kosher as long as it reaches a height of ten Tefachim, even though it does not reach within three Tefachim of the Sechach.</p></div>
<div class="indent1"><span class="nm">(c)</span><p><span class="cl">(R. Yosi):</span> A wall which is woven from the Sechach down, for at least 10 Tefachim, is Kosher, even if it ends more than three Tefachim from the ground, just like a wall built from the bottom up.</p></div>
<div class="subject"><span class="nm">5)</span><p>MECHITZAH TELUYAH</p></div>
<div class="indent1"><span class="nm">(a)</span><p><span class="cl">Question:</span> What is the basis for the Machlokes in the Mishnah?</p></div>
<div class="indent1"><span class="nm">(b)</span><p><span class="cl">Answer:</span> Whether a Mechitzah Teluyah (more than three Tefachim off the ground) is considered a Mechitzah to permit carrying (R. Yosi) or not (Tana Kama).</p></div>
<div class="indent1"><span class="nm">(c)</span><p>The issue is the subject of the Mishnah in Eiruvin:</p></div>
<div class="indent1"><span class="nm">(d)</span><p><span class="cl">(Tana Kama):</span> The residents of adjoining courtyards may draw water from a shared well, provided they made a partition for this purpose (not relying on the property divider).</p></div>
<div class="indent2"><span class="nm">1.</span><p>The partition must be 10 Tefachim tall.</p></div>
<div class="indent2"><span class="nm">2.</span><p>It may extend down to the water or only into the lip of the well, as long as it is built inside the well.</p></div>
<div class="indent1"><span class="nm">(e)</span><p><span class="cl">(R. Shimon b. Gamliel):</span> The matter is subject to a Machlokes Beis Hillel and Beis Shamai.</p></div>
<div class="bbbline">16b----------------------------------------16b</p></div>
<div class="indent2"><span class="nm">1.</span><p>The opinion of the Tana Kama is that of Beis Shamai while according to Beis Hillel, the wall must extend close to the level of the water.</p></div>
<div class="indent2"><span class="nm">2.</span><p>Tosfos DH Beis Shamai reverses the opinions of Beis Shamai and Beis Hillel.</p></div>
<div class="indent1"><span class="nm">(f)</span><p><span class="cl">(R. Yehudah):</span> The wall of the courtyard may fill that role.</p></div>
<div class="indent1"><span class="nm">(g)</span><p><span class="cl">(Rabah bar bar Chanah citing R. Yochanan):</span> R. Yehudah above holds like R. Yosi in our Mishnah (who permits a suspended Mechitzah).</p></div>
<div class="indent1"><span class="nm">(h)</span><p>In fact though, R. Yehudah does not hold like R. Yosi, nor does R. Yosi hold like R. Yehudah.</p></div>
<div class="indent2"><span class="nm">1.</span><p>R. Yehudah may only apply his lenient ruling by Eruv (d'Rabanan, from one Reshus ha'Yachid to another), but not by Sukah, which requires a Mechitzah d'Oraysa.</p></div>
<div class="indent2"><span class="nm">2.</span><p>R. Yosi may permit a Mechitzah Teluyah only by Sukah (a Mitzvas Aseh) while R. Yehudah permits it even by Shabbos (largely a Chiyuv Sekilah).</p></div>
<div class="indent1"><span class="nm">(i)</span><p><span class="cl">Question:</span> But if R. Yosi concedes that a Mechitzah Teluyah does not work on Shabbos, then on what basis did they permit the incident in his town, Tzipori!?</p></div>
<div class="indent1"><span class="nm">(j)</span><p><span class="cl">Answer:</span> That was in the days of R. Yishmael, the son of R. Yosi, who disagreed with his father in this point.</p></div>
<div class="indent1"><span class="nm">(k)</span><p><span class="cl">Question:</span> What was that incident?</p></div>
<div class="indent1"><span class="nm">(l)</span><p><span class="cl">Answer:</span> They constructed a make-shift Mavoy with sheets hanging from the posts to transport the Sefer Torah for use on Shabbos.</p></div>
<div class="indent1"><span class="nm">(m)</span><p><span class="cl">Question:</span> How could they have brought out the sheets without an Eruv!?</p></div>
<div class="indent1"><span class="nm">(n)</span><p><span class="cl">Answer:</span> They <i>found</i> sheets hanging, which did not reach the ground, and they permitted their use, even though they were a Mechitzah Teluyah.</p></div>
<div class="subject"><span class="nm">6)</span><p>AN APPLICATION OF MECHITZAH TELUYAH</p></div>
<div class="indent1"><span class="nm">(a)</span><p>R. Chisda permits putting up a mat in between the ceiling and the floor to form the wall of a Sukah.</p></div>
<div class="indent2"><span class="nm">1.</span><p>The smallest height for the mat (in a minimum height Sukah) would be four Tefachim and a bit.</p></div>
<div class="indent2"><span class="nm">2.</span><p>We would be applying Lavud both at the top and at the bottom.</p></div>
<div class="indent1"><span class="nm">(b)</span><p><span class="cl">Question:</span> But the law of Lavud is well established!?</p></div>
<div class="indent1"><span class="nm">(c)</span><p><span class="cl">Answer:</span> We might not have known to apply Lavud twice.</p></div>
<div class="indent1"><span class="nm">(d)</span><p><span class="cl">Question:</span> But we see from the Beraisa (which requires that a wall be seven-plus Tefachim) that we do <i>not</i> apply Lavud twice!?</p></div>
<div class="indent1"><span class="nm">(e)</span><p><span class="cl">Answer:</span> That Beraisa is speaking about a large Sukah, taller than ten Tefachim where he hangs the seven-plus Tefachim within three Tefachim of the Sechach (Lavud).</p></div>
<div class="indent1"><span class="nm">(f)</span><p><span class="cl">Question:</span> Then what is the news of the Beraisa?</p></div>
<div class="indent1"><span class="nm">(g)</span><p><span class="cl">Answer:</span> The Mechitzah is allowed to hang down to within any distance from the bottom (Mechitzah Teluyah is permitted in a Sukah, like R. Yosi).</p></div>
<div class="subject"><span class="nm">7)</span><p>MINIMUM LENGTH OF A SUKAH</p></div>
<div class="indent1"><span class="nm">(a)</span><p><span class="cl">(R. Ami):</span> It is permitted to place a mat or beam of four-plus Tefachim within three Tefachim of an existing wall (and adjacent to it), to form the second wall of the Sukah.</p></div>
<div class="indent1"><span class="nm">(b)</span><p><span class="cl">Question:</span> What is the news of this teaching (since Lavud is well established)?</p></div>
<div class="indent1"><span class="nm">(c)</span><p><span class="cl">Answer:</span> That the minimum size of a Sukah is seven Tefachim (by seven Tefachim).</p></div>
