<div class="subject"><span class="nm">1)</span><p>TZAFTZEFAH</p></div>
<div class="indent1"><span class="nm">(a)</span><p><span class="cl">(R. Zeira):</span> The source for invalidating the Tzaftzefah is the Pasuk in Yechezkel (17:5).</p></div>
<div class="indent2"><span class="nm">1.</span><p>The People are accused of changing from being rooted in great waters to being a Tzaftzefah.</p></div>
<div class="indent2"><span class="nm">2.</span><p>This indicates that the Tzaftzefah is not water- based.</p></div>
<div class="indent1"><span class="nm">(b)</span><p><span class="cl">Question (Abaye):</span> Perhaps the Pasuk is only explaining what is meant by the great waters (Tzaftzefah)?</p></div>
<div class="indent1"><span class="nm">(c)</span><p><span class="cl">Answer:</span> The implication of Samo is that they became other (worse) than what they were (as R. Avahu read into the Pasuk).</p></div>
<div class="indent1"><span class="nm">(d)</span><p><span class="cl">Alternate rendition of the above:</span> The Tana cited this Pasuk to explain the exclusion of Tzaftzefah, leading to R. Zeira asking Abaye's question and R. Avahu's rendition of the Pasuk.</p></div>
<div class="indent1"><span class="nm">(e)</span><p><span class="cl">Question:</span> What is Aravah and what is Tzaftzefah?</p></div>
<div class="indent1"><span class="nm">(f)</span><p><span class="cl">Answer:</span> The stem of the Aravah is red, its leaves are long and its mouth (the outer ridge of the leaf) is smooth, unlike the Tzaftzefah.</p></div>
<div class="indent1"><span class="nm">(g)</span><p><span class="cl">Question:</span> But we have learned that an Aravah with ridges is Kosher!?</p></div>
<div class="indent1"><span class="nm">(h)</span><p><span class="cl">Answer (Abaye):</span> The Beraisa permits the sickle-edged Aravah known as Chilfa Gila.</p></div>
<div class="indent1"><span class="nm">(i)</span><p><span class="cl">(Abaye):</span> We may infer that Chilfa Gila is a Kosher Aravah (Hoshana).</p></div>
<div class="indent1"><span class="nm">(j)</span><p><span class="cl">Question:</span> Is that not obvious, given that it is an Aravah!?</p></div>
<div class="indent1"><span class="nm">(k)</span><p><span class="cl">Answer:</span> We might have invalidated it due to its associated name.</p></div>
<div class="indent1"><span class="nm">(l)</span><p><span class="cl">Question:</span> Perhaps, indeed, it is invalid?</p></div>
<div class="indent1"><span class="nm">(m)</span><p><span class="cl">Answer:</span> Arvei Nachal implies many types of Aravah.</p></div>
<div class="subject"><span class="nm">2)</span><p>CHANGING NAMES</p></div>
<div class="indent1"><span class="nm">(a)</span><p><span class="cl">(R. Chisda):</span> Three pairs of items have switched their names since the Churban, each carrying an implication in Halachah.</p></div>
<div class="indent1"><span class="nm">(b)</span><p>R. Yosef added a fourth, with implication for Gittin.</p></div>
<div class="bbbline">34b----------------------------------------34b</p></div>
<div class="subject"><span class="nm">3)</span><p>THE NUMBER OF EACH MIN</p></div>
<div class="indent1"><span class="nm">(a)</span><p><span class="cl">(R. Yishmael):</span> One must take three Hadasim, two Aravos, one Lulav and one Esrog.</p></div>
<div class="indent1"><span class="nm">(b)</span><p>At least one Hadas must not be Katum.</p></div>
<div class="indent1"><span class="nm">(c)</span><p><span class="cl">(R. Tarfon):</span> All the Hadasim may be Ketumim.</p></div>
<div class="indent1"><span class="nm">(d)</span><p><span class="cl">(R. Akiva):</span> Only one Hadas is required.</p></div>
<div class="subject"><span class="nm">4)</span><p>THE SOURCES FOR THE POSITIONS IN THE MISHNAH</p></div>
<div class="indent1"><span class="nm">(a)</span><p>The Beraisa provides the source for R. Yishmael's requirements, and follows with R. Tarfon's and R. Akiva's requirements regarding the Hadas.</p></div>
<div class="indent1"><span class="nm">(b)</span><p><span class="cl">(R. Eliezer):</span> The Esrog need not be bound together with the other three Minim, owing to the absence of the connecting Vav in the Pasuk.</p></div>
<div class="indent1"><span class="nm">(c)</span><p>The absence of any of the Minim is Me'akev, as learned from Ul'kachtem.</p></div>
<div class="indent1"><span class="nm">(d)</span><p><span class="cl">Question:</span> On what basis does R. Yishmael only require <i>one</i> Hadas to be non-Katum (either they all must be, or none need be)!?</p></div>
<div class="indent1"><span class="nm">(e)</span><p><span class="cl">Answer (Birah citing R. Ami):</span> R. Yishmael retracted his requirement of three Hadasim, requiring only one, which must be whole.</p></div>
<div class="indent1"><span class="nm">(f)</span><p><span class="cl">(R. Yehudah citing Shmuel):</span> The Halachah follows R. Tarfon (consistent with Shmuel's threat to the Hadasim merchants against their price gouging).</p></div>
<div class="indent1"><span class="nm">(g)</span><p><span class="cl">Question:</span> If Shmuel wanted to follow a lenient view, why didn't he threaten to teach the Halachah like R. Akiva (requiring only one Hadas)?</p></div>
<div class="indent1"><span class="nm">(h)</span><p><span class="cl">Answer:</span> It is easier to find three cut Hadasim than one whole one.</p></div>
<div class="subject"><span class="nm">5)</span><p>ESROG</p></div>
<div class="indent1"><span class="nm">(a)</span><p>The Pesulim include an Esrog which is stolen, dried out, from an Asheirah and Ir ha'Nidachas, from Terumah Temeiah (but Terumah Tehorah, while it should not be used, is Kosher).</p></div>
<div class="indent1"><span class="nm">(b)</span><p>An Esrog of Demai is a Machlokes whether it may (Beis Hillel) or may not (Beis Shamai) be used.</p></div>
<div class="indent1"><span class="nm">(c)</span><p>Ma'aser Sheni in Yerushalayim while it should not be used, is Kosher.</p></div>
<div class="indent1"><span class="nm">(d)</span><p>An Esrog is Pasul if most of the face of the Esrog developed s type of bubbling called Chazazis, or if its Pitom or peel came off, if it developed a crack or is missing any part.</p></div>
<div class="indent1"><span class="nm">(e)</span><p>If the Chazazis only covers a minority of the Esrog, or the Oketz came off, or it has a hole without anything missing it is Kosher.</p></div>
<div class="indent1"><span class="nm">(f)</span><p>A black Esrog is Pasul.</p></div>
<div class="indent1"><span class="nm">(g)</span><p>A green (like Karsi) Esrog is a Machlokes whether it is Kosher (R. Meir) or not (R. Yehudah).</p></div>
<div class="indent1"><span class="nm">(h)</span><p>The minimum size of an Esrog is a Machlokes R. Meir (like a nut) and R. Yehudah (like an egg).</p></div>
<div class="indent1"><span class="nm">(i)</span><p>The maximum size is a machlokes R. Yehudah (must be able to hold two such Esrogim in one hand) and R. Yosi (even so large as to need two hands to hold it).</p></div>
