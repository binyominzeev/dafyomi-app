<p class="dedicationbox">BAVA BASRA 140 (17 Sivan) - Today's Daf is dedicated to the memory of Moshe Grun (Moshe Shlomo ben Michael) by his friend, Seymour, in Jerusalem. </p>

<p class="bas subject"><span class="nm">1)</span>WHAT IS CONSIDERED A LARGE ENOUGH ESTATE?</p>
<p class="bas indent1"><span class="nm">(a)</span><span class="cl">Question:</span> If there is less than this, do the girls get everything?!</p>
<p class="bas indent1"><span class="nm">(b)</span><span class="cl">Answer (Rava):</span> No. We separate enough money to feed the girls until Bagrus, and the boys are fed from the rest.</p>
<p class="bas indent1"><span class="nm">(c)</span>The following is obvious. If there was 'much' property, and then it became 'little', the boys already inherited (Rashbam - we calculate how much everyone should have received (at the time of death), and everyone receives (proportionally) according to this. The boys will still have money after the girls consumed their portion; Rosh - all are fed until the property runs out);</p>
<p class="bas indent1"><span class="nm">(d)</span><span class="cl">Question:</span> If there was 'little' property, and then it became 'much', what is the law?</p>
<p class="bas indent2"><span class="nm">1.</span>Perhaps the profit goes to the heirs (the girls are fed until Bagrus, and the boys get the rest);</p>
<p class="bas indent2"><span class="nm">2.</span>Or, perhaps inheritance does not apply here. (We calculate what everyone should have received at the time of death, and all receive accordingly. The girls keep the excess above what they will eat.)</p>
<p class="bas indent1"><span class="nm">(e)</span><span class="cl">Answer (R. Asi):</span> If there was little property and the boys sold it, the sale stands. (This shows that they inherited.)</p>
<p class="bas indent1"><span class="nm">(f)</span><span class="cl">Version #1 - Question #1 (R. Yirmeyah of R. Avahu; also, all the coming questions):</span> In calculating whether there is much or little property, do we consider that also the widow is fed from the estate?</p>
<p class="bas indent2"><span class="nm">1.</span>Since also she is fed, this enters the calculation;</p>
<p class="bas indent2"><span class="nm">2.</span>Or, since if she will remarry, she will no longer be fed, it does not enter the calculation.</p>
<p class="bas indent1"><span class="nm">(g)</span><span class="cl">Question #2:</span> If it does not enter the calculation, if the husband accepted to feed his wife's daughter (e.g. from a prior husband), does this enter the calculation?</p>
<p class="bas indent2"><span class="nm">1.</span>Since she is fed even if she will remarry, it enters the calculation;</p>
<p class="bas indent2"><span class="nm">2.</span>Or, since perhaps she will not be fed the entire time (she might die), it does not enter the calculation.</p>
<p class="bas indent1"><span class="nm">(h)</span><span class="cl">Question #3:</span> If it does not enter the calculation, if the husband left a creditor, does it enter the calculation?</p>
<p class="bas indent2"><span class="nm">1.</span>Since even if he dies, the debt will be collected (by his heirs), it enters the calculation;</p>
<p class="bas indent2"><span class="nm">2.</span>Or, since he has not yet collected the debt, it does not enter the calculation.</p>
<p class="bas indent1"><span class="nm">(i)</span><span class="cl">Version #2 - Question #1:</span> If the husband left a creditor, does it enter the calculation? (The sides of the question are like above.)</p>
<p class="bas bbbline">140b----------------------------------------140b</p>
<p class="bas indent1"><span class="nm">(j)</span><span class="cl">Question #2:</span> If the husband accepted to feed his wife's daughter, does it enter the calculation?</p>
<p class="bas indent1"><span class="nm">(k)</span><span class="cl">Question #3:</span> If the widow is also fed from the estate, does it enter the calculation? (end of Version #2)</p>
<p class="bas indent1"><span class="nm">(l)</span><span class="cl">Question:</span> If there is not enough food to feed the widow and the daughter, which has precedence?</p>
<p class="bas indent1"><span class="nm">(m)</span><span class="cl">Answer (to this last question - R. Avahu):</span> A widow with respect to a daughter is like a daughter with respect to a son: if there is little property, the daughters are fed and the sons beg;</p>
<p class="bas indent2"><span class="nm">1.</span>Likewise, the widow is fed and the daughter begs for her food.</p>
<p class="bas subject"><span class="nm">2)</span>WHY DO SONS LOSE?</p>
<p class="bas indent1"><span class="nm">(a)</span><span class="cl">(Mishnah):</span> Admon says, why should I lose, because I am a male?!</p>
<p class="bas indent1"><span class="nm">(b)</span><span class="cl">Question:</span> What does this mean?</p>
<p class="bas indent1"><span class="nm">(c)</span><span class="cl">Answer #1 (Abaye):</span> Because I am a male, and it is proper that I learn Torah, should I lose?!</p>
<p class="bas indent1"><span class="nm">(d)</span><span class="cl">Objection (Rava):</span> Will you say that only one who learns Torah should inherit?!</p>
<p class="bas indent1"><span class="nm">(e)</span><span class="cl">Answer #2 (Rava):</span> Rather, because I am a male and I inherit when there is much property, should I lose when there is little property?!</p>
<p class="bas subject"><span class="nm">3)</span>HOW A TUMTUM INHERITS</p>
<p class="bas indent1"><span class="nm">(a)</span><span class="cl">(Mishnah):</span> If a man died, and left sons, daughters, and a Tumtum (one whose genitals are covered; we do not know his or her gender), if there is much property, the Tumtum does not inherit. The boys say 'you are with the girls';</p>
<p class="bas indent2"><span class="nm">1.</span>If there is little property, the Tumtum is not fed (with the girls). They say 'you are with the boys'.</p>
<p class="bas indent1"><span class="nm">(b)</span>If Levi (a Shechiv Mera, or he is healthy and he asked someone else to acquire on behalf of his child to be born) said 'if my wife will give birth to a male, he should receive 100 Zuz', we fulfill his words;</p>
<p class="bas indent2"><span class="nm">1.</span>If he said 'if she will give birth to a female, she should receive 200', we fulfill this;</p>
<p class="bas indent2"><span class="nm">2.</span>If he said 'if she will give birth to a male, he should receive 100. If she will give birth to a female, she should receive 200', if she gave birth to both, each receives like the stipulation;</p>
<p class="bas indent3"><span class="nm">i.</span>If she gave birth to a Tumtum, he does not receive.</p>
<p class="bas indent3"><span class="nm">ii.</span>If he said 'whatever she will give birth to, the baby should receive', even a Tumtum receives.</p>
<p class="bas indent2"><span class="nm">3.</span>If there are no other children, a Tumtum inherits his parents.</p>
<p class="bas indent1"><span class="nm">(c)</span><span class="cl">(Gemara) Inference:</span> (If there is much property,) the Tumtum does not inherit. The boys say 'you are with the girls', and he is fed like a girl.</p>
<p class="bas indent1"><span class="nm">(d)</span><span class="cl">Contradiction (Seifa):</span> If she gave birth to a Tumtum, he does not receive (because a Tumtum is neither male nor female)!</p>
<p class="bas indent1"><span class="nm">(e)</span><span class="cl">Answer #1 (Abaye):</span> The boys say 'you are with the girls', but the Tumtum does not receive like a girl.</p>
<p class="bas indent1"><span class="nm">(f)</span><span class="cl">Answer #2 (Rava):</span> Indeed, the Tumtum is fed like a girl;</p>
<p class="bas indent2"><span class="nm">1.</span>The Seifa is like R. Shimon ben Gamliel.</p>
<p class="bas indent2"><span class="nm">2.</span><span class="cl">(Mishnah):</span> (An animal was about to give birth for the first time. The owner said 'if the fetus inside is a male, it is an Olah. If it is a female, it is a Shelamim.') If it gave birth to a Tumtum or Androginus, it has no Kedushah.</p>
<p class="bas indent1"><span class="nm">(g)</span><span class="cl">Question (Beriasa):</span> A Tumtum inherits like a son and is fed like a daughter.</p>
<p class="bas indent2"><span class="nm">1.</span>This is not difficult for Rava. A Tumtum inherits like a son when there is little property, and he is fed like a daughter when there is much property.</p>
<p class="bas indent2"><span class="nm">2.</span>According to Abaye, he is never fed like a daughter!</p>
<p class="bas indent2"><span class="nm">3.</span><span class="cl">Counter-question:</span> Even according to Rava, what does it mean 'a Tumtum inherits like a son'? (This implies even a large amount. According to Rava, he never receives more than the cost of food until Bagrus!)</p>
<p class="bas indent2"><span class="nm">4.</span><span class="cl">Answer:</span> We must say that it means that he <i>should</i> inherit like a son, but he does not;</p>
<p class="bas indent1"><span class="nm">(h)</span><span class="cl">Answer:</span> Also here, he <i>should</i> be fed like a daughter, but he is not.</p>
