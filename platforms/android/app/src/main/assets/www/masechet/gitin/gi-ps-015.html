<p class="bas subject"><span class="nm">1)</span>THE WORDS OF A <i>SHECHIV</i> <i>MERA</i></p>
<p class="bas indent1"><span class="nm">(a)</span><span class="cl">(Mishnah - R. Elazar):</span> If one declares how to divide his estate, whether he is healthy or Shechiv Mera, land is acquired only through a document, money or Chazakah (using the land like an owner). One acquires Metaltelim (movable property) by taking them to his premises;</p>
<p class="bas indent1"><span class="nm">(b)</span>Chachamim say, both land and Metaltelim (of a Shechiv Mera) are acquired through his words.</p>
<p class="bas indent2"><span class="nm">1.</span><span class="cl">Chachamim:</span> A case occurred in which the mother of Bnei Rochel was sick. She said 'give my very expensive pin to my daughter', and Chachamim fulfilled her words!</p>
<p class="bas indent2"><span class="nm">2.</span><span class="cl">R. Elazar:</span> Bnei Rochel were terrible sinners. Chachamim fined them by giving the pin to her daughter.</p>
<p class="bas indent1"><span class="nm">(c)</span>The first Tana (of the previous Beraisa) holds like R. Elazar. R. Nasan and R. Yakov agree with this, and also say that there is no Mitzvah to fulfill the words of the deceased;</p>
<p class="bas indent1"><span class="nm">(d)</span>'Some say' hold like Chachamim of the Mishnah (that the words of a Shechiv Mera acquire);</p>
<p class="bas indent1"><span class="nm">(e)</span>R. Yehudah ha'Nasi holds like R. Elazar, but there is a Mitzvah to fulfill the words of the deceased;</p>
<p class="bas indent1"><span class="nm">(f)</span>Chachamim say to split the money. They are unsure (whether the Halachah follows R. Elazar or Chachamim of the Mishnah, and whether or not there is a Mitzvah to fulfill the words of the deceased);</p>
<p class="bas indent1"><span class="nm">(g)</span>Chachamim of Bavel say, it is best to leave it to the whim of the Shali'ach.</p>
<p class="bas indent1"><span class="nm">(h)</span>R. Shimon ha'Nasi teaches how they ruled in an actual case</p>
<p class="bas indent1"><span class="nm">(i)</span><span class="cl">Question:</span> Was R. Shimon ha'Nasi the Nasi, or did R. Shimon say 'the Nasi said...'? (Tosfos - we never heard that R. Shimon was Nasi, therefore we suspect that perhaps the Mishnah is abbreviated.)</p>
<p class="bas indent1"><span class="nm">(j)</span><span class="cl">Answer:</span> Rav Yosef said that the Halachah follows R. Shimon ha'Nasi. (This shows that he was the Nasi.)</p>
<p class="bas indent1"><span class="nm">(k)</span><span class="cl">Rejection:</span> We can also ask about what Rav Yosef meant! (Perhaps he rules like R. Shimon said in the name of the Nasi, and he merely cited the Beraisa.)</p>
<p class="bas indent2"><span class="nm">1.</span>The question is unresolved.</p>
<p class="bas indent1"><span class="nm">(l)</span><span class="cl">(Rav Yosef):</span> The Halachah follows R. Shimon ha'Nasi.</p>
<p class="bas indent1"><span class="nm">(m)</span><span class="cl">Question:</span> We hold that the words of a Shechiv Mera acquire!</p>
<p class="bas indent1"><span class="nm">(n)</span><span class="cl">Answer:</span> Rav Yosef explains that Reuven is healthy (like we originally explained the Beraisa).</p>
<p class="bas indent1"><span class="nm">(o)</span><span class="cl">Question:</span> R. Shimon ha'Nasi said that the money goes to Reuven's heirs. We hold that it is a Mitzvah to fulfill the words of the deceased!</p>
<p class="bas indent1"><span class="nm">(p)</span><span class="cl">Correction:</span> The Beraisa should say, R. Shimon ha'Nasi says... to Ploni's heirs.</p>
<p class="perekline">PEREK HA'MEVI 2</p>
<p class="bas subject"><span class="nm">2)</span>A PARTIAL DECLARATION</p>
<p class="bas indent1"><span class="nm">(a)</span><span class="cl">(Mishnah):</span> In the following cases, a Get from Chutz la'Aretz is Pasul:</p>
<p class="bas indent2"><span class="nm">1.</span>The Shali'ach said 'in front of me it was written, but not signed; 'in front of me it was signed, but not written'; 'in front of me it was totally written, and half was signed'; or, 'in front of me it was totally signed, and half was written.'</p>
<p class="bas indent1"><span class="nm">(b)</span>If one Shali'ach says 'it was written in front of me', and another Shali'ach says 'it was signed in front of me', it is Pasul;</p>
<p class="bas indent1"><span class="nm">(c)</span>If two Sheluchim say 'it was written in front of us', and another Shali'ach says 'it was signed in front of me', it is Pasul;</p>
<p class="bas indent1"><span class="nm">(d)</span>R. Yehudah says, it is valid.</p>
<p class="bas indent1"><span class="nm">(e)</span>If one Shali'ach says 'it was written in front of me', and two Sheluchim say 'it was signed in front of us', it is valid.</p>
<p class="bas indent1"><span class="nm">(f)</span><span class="cl">(Gemara) Question:</span> We already learned that the Shali'ach must say 'it was written and signed in front of me'!</p>
<p class="bas indent1"><span class="nm">(g)</span><span class="cl">Answer:</span> If only for that Mishnah, one might have thought that it should be said, but the Get is valid even if he did not say it. Our Mishnah teaches that this is not so.</p>
<p class="bas indent1"><span class="nm">(h)</span><span class="cl">(Mishnah):</span> If he said 'in front of me, it was totally signed, and half was written', the Get is Pasul.</p>
<p class="bas indent1"><span class="nm">(i)</span><span class="cl">Question:</span> Which half was written in front of him?</p>
<p class="bas indent2"><span class="nm">1.</span><span class="cl">Suggestion:</span> The first half was in front of him.</p>
<p class="bas indent2"><span class="nm">2.</span><span class="cl">Rejection:</span> R. Elazar taught that it suffices to see the first line written Lishmah!</p>
<p class="bas indent1"><span class="nm">(j)</span><span class="cl">Answer:</span> Rather, he saw the second half.</p>
<p class="bas indent1"><span class="nm">(k)</span><span class="cl">(Mishnah):</span> If he said 'it was totally written, and half was signed, in front of me', it is Pasul.</p>
<p class="bas indent1"><span class="nm">(l)</span><span class="cl">Opinion #1 (Rav Chisda):</span> Even if two people testify about the signature that the Shali'ach did not see, it is Pasul;</p>
<p class="bas indent2"><span class="nm">1.</span>The Kiyum must be totally like standard Kiyum of a Get (two witnesses about each signature), or totally like the enactment of Chachamim.</p>
<p class="bas indent1"><span class="nm">(m)</span><span class="cl">Objection (Rava):</span> If one person (the Shali'ach) would testify about the second signature, the Get would be valid. Now that two testify about it, can it be Pasul?!</p>
<p class="bas bbbline">15b----------------------------------------15b</p>
<p class="bas indent1"><span class="nm">(n)</span><span class="cl">Opinion #2 (Rava):</span> Even if the Shali'ach and another person testify about the other signatures, it is Pasul.</p>
<p class="bas indent2"><span class="nm">1.</span>This is a decree, lest people think that we can be Mekayem other documents similarly, i.e. a witness confirms his own signature, and joins a second man to confirm the other signature.</p>
<p class="bas indent2"><span class="nm">2.</span>This Kiyum is Pasul, since three fourths of it relies on one witness.</p>
<p class="bas indent1"><span class="nm">(o)</span><span class="cl">Objection (Rav Ashi):</span> If one person (the Shali'ach) would say everything (that he saw both signatures), the Get would be valid. Now that two testify about it, can it be Pasul?!</p>
<p class="bas indent1"><span class="nm">(p)</span><span class="cl">Opinion #3 (Rav Ashi):</span> Even if the Shali'ach is the other witness, it is Pasul.</p>
<p class="bas indent2"><span class="nm">1.</span>The Kiyum must be totally like standard Kiyum of a Get, or totally like the enactment of Chachamim.</p>
<p class="bas indent1"><span class="nm">(q)</span><span class="cl">(Mishnah):</span> If he said 'it was totally written, and half was signed, in front of me', it is Pasul.</p>
<p class="bas indent1"><span class="nm">(r)</span><span class="cl">Question:</span> Does anyone testify about the other signature?</p>
<p class="bas indent2"><span class="nm">1.</span><span class="cl">Suggestion:</span> No.</p>
<p class="bas indent2"><span class="nm">2.</span><span class="cl">Rejection:</span> When one Shali'ach says 'it was written in front of me', and another Shali'ach says 'it was signed in front of me', each testifies about the entire Get, yet it is Pasul. Here, there is testimony about only half the signatures, there is no need to teach that it is Pasul!</p>
<p class="bas indent1"><span class="nm">(s)</span><span class="cl">Answer:</span> (We must say that a second witness testifies about the second signature.) The Mishnah teaches like Rava or Rav Ashi.</p>
<p class="bas indent1"><span class="nm">(t)</span><span class="cl">Question:</span> This refutes Rav Chisda. (If it were Pasul even when two witnesses testify about the second signature, the Mishnah should have taught this!)</p>
<p class="bas indent2"><span class="nm">1.</span><span class="cl">Counter-question (Rav Chisda):</span> Why does the Mishnah teach 'it was written, but not signed, in front of me?' The Seifa disqualifies even if it was written and half-signed in front of him!</p>
<p class="bas indent2"><span class="nm">2.</span><span class="cl">Answer:</span> Indeed, the Reisha could be learned from the Seifa, which teaches a bigger Chidush.</p>
<p class="bas indent1"><span class="nm">(u)</span><span class="cl">Answer:</span> Also here, the Reisha could be learned from the Seifa, which teaches a bigger Chidush!</p>
<p class="bas subject"><span class="nm">3)</span>OTHER THINGS THAT DO OR DO NOT JOIN</p>
<p class="bas indent1"><span class="nm">(a)</span><span class="cl">(Rav Chisda):</span> If a ditch five Tefachim deep is next to a wall five Tefachim tall, they do not join to be considered a wall;</p>
<p class="bas indent2"><span class="nm">1.</span>A wall must be 10 Tefachim below ground (e.g. the edge of a pit) or 10 Tefachim above ground.</p>
<p class="bas indent1"><span class="nm">(b)</span><span class="cl">(Mereimar):</span> If a ditch five Tefachim deep is next to a wall five Tefachim tall, they join to be considered a wall.</p>
<p class="bas indent1"><span class="nm">(c)</span>The Halachah follows Mereimar.</p>
<p class="bas indent1"><span class="nm">(d)</span><span class="cl">Question (Ilfa):</span> Can hands become Tahor half-way?</p>
<p class="bas indent2"><span class="nm">1.</span><span class="cl">Question:</span> What is the case?</p>
<p class="bas indent3"><span class="nm">i.</span><span class="cl">Suggestion:</span> Two people wash their hands from one Revi'is (the bare minimum to wash hands).</p>
<p class="bas indent3"><span class="nm">ii.</span><span class="cl">Rejection (Mishnah):</span> One Revi'is suffices for one or two people to wash their hands. (Ilfa would not be unsure about this!)</p>
<p class="bas indent2"><span class="nm">2.</span><span class="cl">Answer #1:</span> Rather, he washed one hand at a time.</p>
<p class="bas indent2"><span class="nm">3.</span><span class="cl">Rejection (Mishnah):</span> If one pours water on one hand and immerses the other (in a river), his hands are Tahor (even though he washed one at a time)!</p>
<p class="bas indent2"><span class="nm">4.</span><span class="cl">Answer #2:</span> Rather, he washed half of his hand, and then the other half.</p>
<p class="bas indent1"><span class="nm">(e)</span><span class="cl">Question:</span> R. Yanai taught that hands do not become Tahor half-way!</p>
<p class="bas indent1"><span class="nm">(f)</span><span class="cl">Answer #1:</span> Ilfa asks about when there is still liquid Tofe'ach (wet) on he first half when he washes the second half. R. Yanai discusses when the first half dried before washing the second.</p>
