<div class="indent1"><span class="nm">(a)</span><p><span class="cl">(Tana Kama):</span> If the Sechach of the Sukah is higher than 20 Amos, the Sukah is Pesulah.</p></div>
<div class="indent1"><span class="nm">(b)</span><p><span class="cl">(R. Yehudah):</span> It is Kesheirah.</p></div>
<div class="indent1"><span class="nm">(c)</span><p>A Sukah less than 10 Tefachim tall, or having less than three walls, or whose light is more than its shade, is Pesulah.</p></div>
<div class="subject"><span class="nm">2)</span><p>SOURCES FOR THE PESUL OF EXCESSIVE HEIGHT</p></div>
<div class="indent1"><span class="nm">(a)</span><p><span class="cl">Question:</span> Why by Eruvin are we taught to repair the Mavoy (by shortening it) while here we are only taught that it is Pesulah?</p></div>
<div class="indent1"><span class="nm">(b)</span><p><span class="cl">Answer:</span> Regarding Sukah, which is d'Oraisa, the appropriate language is Pesulah, as opposed to a Mavoy (d'Rabanan).</p></div>
<div class="indent1"><span class="nm">(c)</span><p><span class="cl">Alternate Answer:</span> Our Mishnah lists many Pesulim, whose varied corrective measures would encumber the Mishnah (as opposed to Mavoy with fewer invalidations).</p></div>
<div class="indent1"><span class="nm">(d)</span><p><span class="cl">Question:</span> What is the source for the Pesul of height?</p></div>
<div class="indent1"><span class="nm">(e)</span><p><span class="cl">Answer (Rabah):</span> The Pasuk instructs us to dwell in a Sukah in order to recall Hash-m's miraculous protection, and this is lost if the Sukah is too tall to catch one's eye (20 Amos).</p></div>
<div class="indent1"><span class="nm">(f)</span><p><span class="cl">Answer (R. Zeira):</span> The Pasuk (Yeshaya 4:6) teaches that we should be dwelling in the shade of the Sukah not the shade of the walls, which would be the case over 20 Amos.</p></div>
<div class="indent2"><span class="nm">1.</span><p><span class="cl">Question (Abaye):</span> Then we should invalidate a Sukah built in a valley between two tall mountains!?</p></div>
<div class="indent2"><span class="nm">2.</span><p><span class="cl">Answer (R. Zeira):</span> There the Sukah would still be valid even without the sun-blocking mountains, whereas our Sukah would not be valid (since its Sechach does not generate any shade at all) without the walls.</p></div>
<div class="indent1"><span class="nm">(g)</span><p><span class="cl">Answer (Rava):</span> Such a tall Sukah would not normally be made as a temporary dwelling (Diras Ar'ai), a requirement of Sukah (based on the Pasuk).</p></div>
<div class="indent2"><span class="nm">1.</span><p><span class="cl">Question (Abaye):</span> Would a Sukah made of iron walls then be Pesulah?</p></div>
<div class="indent2"><span class="nm">2.</span><p><span class="cl">Answer (Rava):</span> The Pasuk is delimiting a <i>measurement</i> for a Diras Ar'ai (not specifying that the structure must be built to collapse after seven days).</p></div>
<div class="bbbline">2b----------------------------------------2b</p></div>
<div class="indent1"><span class="nm">(h)</span><p><span class="cl">Question:</span> On what basis do Rabah, R. Zeira and Rava argue?</p></div>
<div class="indent1"><span class="nm">(i)</span><p><span class="cl">Answer:</span> Owing to a weakness in each of the positions.</p></div>
<div class="indent2"><span class="nm">1.</span><p>They disagree with Rabah because they understand the Pasuk is speaking of historical awareness not awareness of the dwelling itself.</p></div>
<div class="indent2"><span class="nm">2.</span><p>They disagree with R. Zeira because the Pasuk he cites is speaking of the future clouds in the times of the Mashiach (which will create shade, but not speaking of a Sukah, which is only for Sechach, not for shade).</p></div>
<div class="indent3"><span class="nm">i.</span><p><span class="cl">Question:</span> Why does R. Zeira disagree with this?</p></div>
<div class="indent3"><span class="nm">ii.</span><p><span class="cl">Answer:</span> If so, the Pasuk would say Chupah, not Sukah (which adds the additional implication).</p></div>
<div class="indent2"><span class="nm">3.</span><p>They disagree with Rava because of Abaye's question.</p></div>
<div class="indent1"><span class="nm">(j)</span><p><span class="cl">Question:</span> With which opinion does this teaching of Rav agree:</p></div>
<div class="indent2"><span class="nm">1.</span><p><span class="cl">(R. Yoshiya):</span> Rav taught that the Machlokes in our Mishnah is only where the walls do not reach the Sechach.</p></div>
<div class="indent2"><span class="nm">2.</span><p>If the walls reach the Sechach, then even more than 20 Amos are acceptable according to all.</p></div>
<div class="indent1"><span class="nm">(k)</span><p><span class="cl">Answer:</span> Like Rabah, who makes the criteria for Kashrus that which catches the eye, and the unbroken wall draws one's eyes all the way to the Sechach.</p></div>
<div class="indent1"><span class="nm">(l)</span><p><span class="cl">Question:</span> With which opinion does the teaching of Rav agree?</p></div>
<div class="indent2"><span class="nm">1.</span><p><span class="cl">(R. Huna):</span> Rav taught that the Machlokes in our Mishnah is only where the floor of the Sukah is 4x4 Amos.</p></div>
<div class="indent2"><span class="nm">2.</span><p>If the floor is more than 4x4, then even more than 20 Amos height is acceptable.</p></div>
<div class="indent1"><span class="nm">(m)</span><p><span class="cl">Answer:</span> Like R. Zeira, who looks for shade in a Sukah, and the larger Sukah allows for the shade of the Sechach to reach the floor (it is not only shaded by the walls).</p></div>
<div class="indent1"><span class="nm">(n)</span><p><span class="cl">Question:</span> With which opinion does this teaching of Rav agree:</p></div>
<div class="indent2"><span class="nm">1.</span><p><span class="cl">(R. Chanan b. Rabah):</span> Rav taught that the Machlokes in our Mishnah is only if the Sukah is exactly 7x7 Tefachim (minimum space for a table and most of a person).</p></div>
<div class="indent2"><span class="nm">2.</span><p>Larger than 7x7 Tefachim will permit a taller Sukah.</p></div>
<div class="indent1"><span class="nm">(o)</span><p><span class="cl">Answer:</span> Like none of the opinions cited (the Sechach does not catch the eye, it does not provide shade, and the walls would not be Ar'ai).</p></div>
<div class="subject"><span class="nm">3)</span><p>R. YOSHIYA, R. HUNA AND R. CHANAN BAR RABAH</p></div>
<div class="indent1"><span class="nm">(a)</span><p><span class="cl">Question:</span> On what basis do each of these understand the Machlokes between R. Yehudah and Rabanan differently?</p></div>
<div class="indent1"><span class="nm">(b)</span><p>We can understand why R. Yoshiya argues with the others because he maintains that the Machlokes in the Mishnah is not bound by a Shiur of the floor size of the Sukah (see R. Chananel for an alternate Girsa).</p></div>
<div class="indent1"><span class="nm">(c)</span><p>But why not maintain that R. Huna and R. Chanan b. Rabah (are not arguing over what Rav taught, because Rav only referred to a Kosher Sukah, but they) are arguing over the minimum size of a Sukah (4x4 Amos or 7x7 Tefachim)?</p></div>
<div class="indent1"><span class="nm">(d)</span><p>No, all agree that the minimum size of a Sukah is 7x7 Tefachim, and they are arguing over the following. Did Rav teach that the Machlokes in our Mishnah applies only to a Sukah that is exactly 7x7 Tefachim, but if the Sukah is larger than that all would agree that even a tall Sukah is Kesheirah? Or does the Machlokes in our Mishnah apply to any Sukah that is from 7x7 Tefachim to 4x4 Amos, and if the Sukah is larger than that all would agree that even a tall Sukah is Kesheirah?</p></div>
<div class="subject"><span class="nm">4)</span><p>THE SUKAH OF QUEEN HELENA</p></div>
<div class="indent1"><span class="nm">(a)</span><p><span class="cl">Question:</span> The incident of Queen Helena's Sukah should prove the position of Rabah!?</p></div>
<div class="indent2"><span class="nm">1.</span><p>A Beraisa teaches that R. Yehudah supports his position (of permitting unlimited height) from the silence of the Chachamim regarding the taller Sukah of Queen Helena in Lod.</p></div>
<div class="indent2"><span class="nm">2.</span><p>That is because she is Peturah from Sukah!</p></div>
<div class="indent2"><span class="nm">3.</span><p><span class="cl">(R. Yehudah):</span> But she had seven sons, and, furthermore, she was always careful to consult the Chachamim for everything!?</p></div>
<div class="indent2"><span class="nm">4.</span><p><span class="cl">Question:</span> Why did R. Yehudah need to add the 'furthermore?'</p></div>
<div class="indent2"><span class="nm">5.</span><p><span class="cl">Answer:</span> He was thus anticipating their responses:</p></div>
<div class="indent3"><span class="nm">i.</span><p><span class="cl">(Chachamim):</span> The boys were minors (Peturim in Sukah).</p></div>
<div class="indent3"><span class="nm">ii.</span><p><span class="cl">(R. Yehudah):</span> Surely among these seven there was at least one who was old enough to be obligated, Mi'd'Rabanan, in Sukah.</p></div>
<div class="indent3"><span class="nm">iii.</span><p><span class="cl">(Chachamim):</span> She did not pay attention to Rabbinic obligations.</p></div>
<div class="indent3"><span class="nm">iv.</span><p><span class="cl">(R. Yehudah):</span> Furthermore, she was always careful..</p></div>
<div class="indent2"><span class="nm">6.</span><p>We understand there being a Machlokes between Chachamim and R. Yehudah about the Kashrus of the Queen's Sukah according to Rabah, since it is reasonable that a Queen would have a Sukah whose walls do not reach the Sechach, (to provide ventilation), but it is unlikely that she was sitting is a <i>small</i> Sukah and, according to R. Zeira and Rava (who say that the Machlokes in our Mishnah only applies to a Sukah of small dimensions), there should not have been a Machlokes about the Queen's Sukah at all!?</p></div>
<div class="indent1"><span class="nm">(b)</span><p><span class="cl">Answer:</span> The discussion regarding the Queen's Sukah took place because it was comprised of small rooms (which were less than 4x4 Amos, thus triggering the Machlokes Chachamim and R. Yehudah).</p></div>
<div class="indent1"><span class="nm">(c)</span><p><span class="cl">Question:</span> Does a Queen make a Sukah out of small rooms?</p></div>
<div class="indent1"><span class="nm">(d)</span><p><span class="cl">Answer:</span> No, it was a large Sukah which <i>also</i> had a small room (her private chambers).</p></div>
<div class="indent2"><span class="nm">1.</span><p>The Chachamim assumed that her sons were dwelling in the large room and she was using the small chamber for her privacy, and hence they did not see any reason to object.</p></div>
<div class="indent2"><span class="nm">2.</span><p>R. Yehudah understood that her sons sat with her in her chambers and that there were, among them, those who were already obligated d'Rabanan, in Sukah.</p></div>
<div class="indent1"><span class="nm">(e)</span><p>Hence, according to R. Yehudah, the silence of the Chachamim is indicative of his position regarding the height of Sukah.</p></div>
