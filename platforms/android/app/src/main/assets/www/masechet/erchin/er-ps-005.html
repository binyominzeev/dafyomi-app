<div class="indent1"><span class="nm">(e)</span><p><span class="cl">Answer:</span> R. Meir holds that one does not say vain things (about Hekdesh. We must interpret his words in a way that they take effect);</p></div>

<div class="indent1"><span class="nm">(k)</span><p><span class="cl">Answer:</span> One might have explain R. Meir differently, i.e. he decrees to obligate one who was Ma'arich a baby before one month, lest people think that even a baby above one month has no Erech, but there is no need to decree about Erech of a Kli;</p></div>
<div class="indent2"><span class="nm">1.</span><p>Rav teaches that this is not so. In both cases R. Meir holds that one does not say vain things.</p></div>

<div class="indent2"><span class="nm">1.</span><p><span class="cl">(Rav Gidal citing Rav):</span> If one said "the Erech of this Kli is Alai," he must give its value.</p></div>
<div class="indent1"><span class="nm">(o)</span><p><span class="cl">Answer:</span> One might have thought that since people know that a Kli has no Erech, he intended to be Makdish its value, but since one can be Makdish an animal, perhaps he intended to be Makdish it now (for a Korban) on condition that Shimon will consent to sell it, but he does not intend to be Makdish its value.
