<p class="bas indent1"><span class="nm">(a)</span><span class="cl">Rejection:</span> The Beraisa cannot refer to Kodshei Mizbe'ach. The Seifa says "even if he said 'the head of this cow is Hekdesh,' only the head is Hekdesh";</p>
<p class="bas indent2"><span class="nm">1.</span>If this was Kodshei Mizbe'ach, the Kedushah would spread to the whole animal!</p>
<p class="bas indent2"><span class="nm">2.</span><span class="cl">(Beraisa - R. Meir and R. Yehudah) Suggestion:</span> If one says "the leg of this animal is an Olah," perhaps the entire animal is an Olah!</p>
<p class="bas indent2"><span class="nm">3.</span><span class="cl">Rejection:</span> "Kol Asher Yiten <i>Mimenu</i> la'Shem Yihyeh Kodesh" teaches that part of it will be Kodesh, but not all of it.</p>

<p class="bas indent3"><span class="nm">i.</span>It is sold to someone who needs an Olah. The money becomes Chulin, except for the value of the leg.</p>
<p class="bas indent2"><span class="nm">6.</span>R. Yosi and R. Shimon say, if one says "the leg of this animal is an Olah," the entire animal is an Olah - "Kol Asher Yiten Mimenu la'Shem Yihyeh Kodesh." (The Gemara in Chulin says that they learn from "Yihyeh.")</p>
<p class="bas indent3"><span class="nm">i.</span>Even R. Meir and R. Yehudah say that the entire animal is not an Olah only when he was Makdish a non-vital organ. All agree that Hekdesh of a vital life organ is Makdish the entire animal!</p>
<p class="bas indent1"><span class="nm">(b)</span><span class="cl">Answer #2 (to the question and counter-question):</span> Kedushah spreads only regarding Kedushas ha'Guf. The Beraisa discusses Kedushas Damim (in order to buy Kodshei Mizbe'ach).</p>
<p class="bas indent1"><span class="nm">(c)</span><span class="cl">Question (Abaye):</span> You (Rabah) yourself taught that if a male was Hukdash to be sold and to buy an Olah with its money, it gets Kedushas ha'Guf! (It itself will be offered.)</p>
<p class="bas indent1"><span class="nm">(d)</span><span class="cl">Answer:</span> That is only if the entire animal was Hukdash, but not if only part was Hukdash.</p>
<p class="bas indent1"><span class="nm">(e)</span><span class="cl">Question (Abaye):</span> You yourself were unsure about this!</p>
<p class="bas indent2"><span class="nm">1.</span><span class="cl">Question (Rabah):</span> If one was Makdish a limb (to buy a Korban), is the entire animal Kodesh?</p>
<p class="bas indent1"><span class="nm">(f)</span><span class="cl">Answer (Rabah):</span> I asked about a Tam animal. The Beraisa discusses a Ba'al Mum, similar to the previous clause, which discusses a donkey.</p>

<p class="bas indent1"><span class="nm">(h)</span><span class="cl">Answer (Rabah):</span> I was unsure before I heard the Beraisa. Once I heard it, I learned that the Kedushah does not spread.</p>
<p class="bas indent1"><span class="nm">(i)</span><span class="cl">Question (Rabah):</span> If one said "Alai Demei Roshi for the Mizbe'ach," is he evaluated bi'Chvodo?</p>

<p class="bas indent2"><span class="nm">2.</span>On the other hand, we never find Kedushas Mizbe'ach that is evaluated bi'Chvodo!</p>

<p class="bas indent1"><span class="nm">(k)</span><span class="cl">Question (Rava):</span> If one said "Erki (my Erech) is Alai for the Mizbe'ach" (and he cannot afford it), does Heseg Yad apply?</p>
<p class="bas indent2"><span class="nm">1.</span>Heseg Yad always applies to Erchin;</p>
<p class="bas indent2"><span class="nm">2.</span>On the other hand, Kedushas Mizbe'ach is always redeemed for its value!</p>

<p class="bas indent1"><span class="nm">(d)</span><span class="cl">Question:</span> What do they argue about?</p>
<p class="bas indent1"><span class="nm">(e)</span><span class="cl">Answer:</span> R. Meir holds that one does not say vain things (about Hekdesh. We must interpret his words in a way that they take effect);</p>
<p class="bas indent2"><span class="nm">1.</span>One knows that Erchin does not apply to a baby before one month. Surely he meant to give its value.</p>

<p class="bas indent2"><span class="nm">1.</span>Perhaps Chachamim exempt only one who vows to give the Erech of a baby before one month, for people err, and they think that just like Erchin apply to babies above a month, also to babies less than a month, but all know that a Kli has no Erech. Surely, he intended to give its value!</p>
<p class="bas indent2"><span class="nm">2.</span>Rav teaches that this is not so.</p>
<p class="bas bbbline">5b----------------------------------------5b</p>
<p class="bas indent1"><span class="nm">(j)</span><span class="cl">Question:</span> Since Rav holds like R. Meir, what is the Chidush of his ruling?</p>
<p class="bas indent1"><span class="nm">(k)</span><span class="cl">Answer:</span> One might have explain R. Meir differently, i.e. he decrees to obligate one who was Ma'arich a baby before one month, lest people think that even a baby above one month has no Erech, but there is no need to decree about Erech of a Kli;</p>
<p class="bas indent2"><span class="nm">1.</span>Rav teaches that this is not so. In both cases R. Meir holds that one does not say vain things.</p>

<p class="bas indent2"><span class="nm">1.</span><span class="cl">(Rabah bar Yosef citing Rav):</span> If Reuven was Makdish Shimon's animal, he gives its value to Hekdesh.</p>

<p class="bas indent1"><span class="nm">(n)</span><span class="cl">Question:</span> Rav already taught this in another way!</p>
<p class="bas indent2"><span class="nm">1.</span><span class="cl">(Rav Gidal citing Rav):</span> If one said "the Erech of this Kli is Alai," he must give its value.</p>
<p class="bas indent1"><span class="nm">(o)</span><span class="cl">Answer:</span> One might have thought that since people know that a Kli has no Erech, he intended to be Makdish its value, but since one can be Makdish an animal, perhaps he intended to be Makdish it now (for a Korban) on condition that Shimon will consent to sell it, but he does not intend to be Makdish its value. Rav teaches that this is not so.</p>
<p class="bas indent1"><span class="nm">(p)</span><span class="cl">(Rav Ashi):</span> This is only if he said "(Shimon's animal is) Alai." If he said "it is a Korban," his words do not take effect.</p>

<p class="bas indent2"><span class="nm">4.</span><span class="cl">Answer:</span> We find that people who cannot be Ne'erach can be Ma'arich, e.g. a Tumtum and Androginus.</p>

<p class="bas indent2"><span class="nm">3.</span>R. Yehudah's reasoning is sound. He learns from Tumtum and Androginus. Even though they have Da'as, they can only be Ma'arich, but they cannot be Ne'erachim;</p>

<p class="bas indent3"><span class="nm">i.</span><span class="cl">(Beraisa):</span> Me'ilah does not apply to Kodshei Mizbe'ach of Nochrim, but it applies to Kodshei Bedek ha'Bayis of Nochrim.</p>
<p class="bas indent1"><span class="nm">(j)</span><span class="cl">Answer #2 (Rava):</span> (Mid'Oraisa, a Nochri can be Ma'arich, and Hekdesh uses his money.) Ezra decreed not to take their money for the Mikdash, lest Yisraelim will (rely on Nochrim and)) slacken from contributing for it (giving time to Nochrim to persuade the king to order to cease building) - "va'Yehi Am ha'Aretz Merapim Yedei Am Yehudah u'Mevahalim Osam Livnos."
