<div class="subject"><span class="nm">1)</span><p>WHEN THREE COMMONERS CAN PERMIT A MUM</p></div>
<div class="indent1"><span class="nm">(a)</span><p><span class="cl">(R. Chiya bar Amram):</span> Three commoners can permit a Mum in a place where there is no expert. Three commoners can permit a vow in a place where there is no Chacham.</p></div>
<div class="indent2"><span class="nm">1.</span><p>His first law teaches that the Halachah does not follow R. Yosi;</p></div>
<div class="indent2"><span class="nm">2.</span><p>His second law teaches that the Halachah does not follow R. Yehudah;</p></div>
<div class="indent3"><span class="nm">i.</span><p><span class="cl">(Beraisa):</span> Three people may permit a vow;</p></div>
<div class="indent3"><span class="nm">ii.</span><p>R. Yehudah says, one of them must be a Chacham.</p></div>
<div class="indent1"><span class="nm">(b)</span><p><span class="cl">Question:</span> R. Chiya allows three commoners to permit a Bechor where there is no Chacham. What kind of Chacham does he refer to?</p></div>
<div class="indent1"><span class="nm">(c)</span><p><span class="cl">Answer (Rav Nachman):</span> He refers to a Chacham like myself. (He must be an outstanding Chacham. He need not be ordained (Semichah).)</p></div>
<div class="indent1"><span class="nm">(d)</span><p><span class="cl">(Beraisa - R. Yehudah):</span> One of the three (to permit a vow) must be a Chacham.</p></div>
<div class="indent1"><span class="nm">(e)</span><p><span class="cl">Question:</span> May the others be utterly unlearned?!</p></div>
<div class="indent1"><span class="nm">(f)</span><p><span class="cl">Answer (Ravina):</span> No. They must be able to understand when something is explained to them.</p></div>
<div class="indent1"><span class="nm">(g)</span><p><span class="cl">(Mishnah - R. Yosi):</span> Even a Sanhedrin of 23 cannot permit a Bechor. Only an expert can.</p></div>
<div class="indent1"><span class="nm">(h)</span><p><span class="cl">(Rav Chananel citing Rav):</span> The Halachah does not follow R. Yosi.</p></div>
<div class="indent1"><span class="nm">(i)</span><p><span class="cl">Question:</span> This is obvious. The general rule is, the Halachah follows the majority, not an individual!</p></div>
<div class="indent1"><span class="nm">(j)</span><p><span class="cl">Answer:</span> One might have thought that the Halachah follows R. Yosi, for Nimuko Imo (he always gave reasons for his laws). Rav teaches that this is not so.</p></div>
<div class="indent1"><span class="nm">(k)</span><p>(R. Yirmeyah bar Aba taught that three commoners can permit a Mum where there is no expert. He was unsure whether he heard this from Rav or Shmuel.)</p></div>
<div class="indent1"><span class="nm">(l)</span><p><span class="cl">Suggestion:</span> He must have heard it from Shmuel, for Rav already taught that the Halachah does not follow R. Yosi! (He would not teach the same matter in two different ways.)</p></div>
<div class="indent1"><span class="nm">(m)</span><p><span class="cl">Rejection:</span> Perhaps Rav taught it only once, and the other teaching was inferred from what he explicitly taught.</p></div>
<div class="subject"><span class="nm">2)</span><p>A SALE OF FORBIDDEN FOOD</p></div>
<div class="indent1"><span class="nm">(a)</span><p><span class="cl">(Mishnah):</span> If Reuven slaughtered a Bechor (and sold it), then it became known that he did not show it to a Chacham, what was eaten was eaten, but (nevertheless) Reuven must return the money he received;</p></div>
<div class="indent1"><span class="nm">(b)</span><p>What was not yet eaten must be buried, and Reuven returns the money.</p></div>
<div class="indent1"><span class="nm">(c)</span><p>Similarly, if Reuven slaughtered a cow (and sold it to Shimon), then it became known that it is a Terefah, what was eaten was eaten. Shimon returns the meat that was not eaten, and Reuven returns the money;</p></div>
<div class="indent2"><span class="nm">1.</span><p>If Shimon sold it to Nochrim or fed it to dogs, (Reuven refunds the money, but deducts because) Shimon must return the value of a Terefah (in place of the meat).</p></div>
<div class="indent1"><span class="nm">(d)</span><p><span class="cl">(Gemara - Beraisa):</span> In the following cases, if Reuven sold food and it later became known that it was forbidden, what was eaten was eaten, and Reuven must return the money:</p></div>
<div class="indent2"><span class="nm">1.</span><p>He sold meat, and it was found to be a Bechor (that was not permitted by a Chacham);</p></div>
<div class="indent2"><span class="nm">2.</span><p>He sold produce, and it was found to be Tevel;</p></div>
<div class="indent2"><span class="nm">3.</span><p>He sold wine, and it was found to be Yayin Nesech.</p></div>
<div class="indent1"><span class="nm">(e)</span><p>R. Shimon ben Elazar says, if he sold things that people detest, he returns the money;</p></div>
<div class="indent2"><span class="nm">1.</span><p>If he sold things that people do not detest, he (returns the money, but) deducts for their value.</p></div>
<div class="indent2"><span class="nm">2.</span><p>People detest Nevelos, Terefos, Shekatzim and Remashim (vermin). They do not detest Bechor, Tevel or Yayin Nesech.</p></div>
<div class="indent1"><span class="nm">(f)</span><p><span class="cl">Question:</span> (According to R. Shimon,) why does Reuven deduct when he sold Bechor? It had no value!</p></div>
<div class="indent1"><span class="nm">(g)</span><p><span class="cl">Answer:</span> The case is, it had a Mum. Shimon ate the blemished part;</p></div>
<div class="indent2"><span class="nm">1.</span><p>Had he not eaten it, Reuven could have shown it to a Chacham, who would have permitted it;</p></div>
<div class="indent2"><span class="nm">2.</span><p>The Beraisa is like R. Yehudah (who says that a Chacham can permit a slaughtered Bechor).</p></div>
<div class="indent1"><span class="nm">(h)</span><p><span class="cl">Question:</span> Why does he deduct when he sold Yayin Nesech? (It is Asur b'Hana'ah!)</p></div>
<div class="indent1"><span class="nm">(i)</span><p><span class="cl">Answer:</span> The case is, Yayin Nesech was mixed with Kosher wine. The Beraisa is like R. Shimon ben Gamliel:</p></div>
<div class="indent2"><span class="nm">1.</span><p><span class="cl">(Mishnah):</span> If Yayin Nesech fell into a pit of Kosher wine, all of it is Asur b'Hana'ah;</p></div>
<div class="indent2"><span class="nm">2.</span><p>R. Shimon ben Gamliel says, he may sell the mixture to a Nochri, except for the quantity of Yayin Nesech. (He may not take money for it.)</p></div>
<div class="perekline">PEREK AL ELU MUMIM</div>
<div class="subject"><span class="nm">3)</span><p>THE SOURCE FOR MUMIM</p></div>
<div class="indent1"><span class="nm">(a)</span><p><span class="cl">(Mishnah):</span> A Bechor may be slaughtered (outside the Mikdash) due to any of the following Mumim of the ear:</p></div>
<div class="indent2"><span class="nm">1.</span><p>A Chisaron in the cartilage (part is missing), but not in the skin;</p></div>
<div class="indent2"><span class="nm">2.</span><p>It is cracked, even if nothing is missing;</p></div>
<div class="indent2"><span class="nm">3.</span><p>There is a hole the size of Karshinah (vetch or horsebean);</p></div>
<div class="indent2"><span class="nm">4.</span><p>It is dry.</p></div>
<div class="indent1"><span class="nm">(b)</span><p><span class="cl">Question:</span> How dry must it be?</p></div>
<div class="indent1"><span class="nm">(c)</span><p><span class="cl">Answer #1:</span> (It must be so dry that) if it is punctured, blood will not exude.</p></div>
<div class="indent1"><span class="nm">(d)</span><p><span class="cl">Answer #2 (R. Yosi ben ha'Meshulam):</span> If one rubs it, it will crumble.</p></div>
<div class="indent1"><span class="nm">(e)</span><p><span class="cl">(Gemara) Question:</span> Why are these Mumim? The Torah specifies only "Pise'ach Oh Iver (lame or blind)"!</p></div>
<div class="indent1"><span class="nm">(f)</span><p><span class="cl">Answer:</span> It says "v'Chi Yihyeh Vo Mum" (to include others).</p></div>
<div class="indent1"><span class="nm">(g)</span><p><span class="cl">Question:</span> We should say that "v'Chi Yihyeh Vo Mum" is a Klal (general term), and "Pise'ach Oh Iver" is a Prat (specific term). From a Klal u'Frat we learn only the Peratim, i.e. lame or blind!</p></div>
<div class="indent1"><span class="nm">(h)</span><p><span class="cl">Answer:</span> "Kol Mum Ra" is another Klal. From a Klal u'Frat u'Chlal we learn everything similar to the Peratim, i.e. visible Mumim that do not heal.</p></div>
<div class="indent1"><span class="nm">(i)</span><p><span class="cl">Question:</span> We should learn only everything similar to the Peratim, i.e. visible Mumim of Bitul Melachah (Rashi - they make the limb dysfunctional; R. Gershom - they make the animal unable to work) and do not heal. (Why does the Mishnah teach Mumim without Bitul Melachah?)</p></div>
<div class="indent2"><span class="nm">1.</span><p><span class="cl">(Mishnah):</span> A Chisaron in the cartilage (is a Mum).</p></div>
<div class="indent1"><span class="nm">(j)</span><p><span class="cl">Answer:</span> "Kol Mum Ra" is a Ribuy. (R. Gershom - it includes Mumim without Bitul Melachah. Rashi - we expound according to Ribuy and Mi'ut, and not according to Klal u'Frat u'Chlal.)</p></div>
<div class="indent1"><span class="nm">(k)</span><p><span class="cl">Question #1:</span> If so, we should also include hidden Mumim!</p></div>
<div class="indent2"><span class="nm">1.</span><p><span class="cl">(Mishnah):</span> If the outer Chutin (gums or teeth) are chipped or cracked, or if the inner Chutin are uprooted (it is a Mum).</p></div>
<div class="bbbline">37b----------------------------------------37b</p></div>
<div class="indent2"><span class="nm">2.</span><p><span class="cl">Inference:</span> If the inner Chutin are only chipped or cracked, this is not a Mum (because it is not visible)!</p></div>
<div class="indent1"><span class="nm">(l)</span><p><span class="cl">Answer:</span> "Mum Ra" excludes Mumim that are not seen.</p></div>
<div class="indent1"><span class="nm">(m)</span><p><span class="cl">Question #2:</span> If so, also a Mum Over (temporary) should be disqualified!</p></div>
<div class="indent2"><span class="nm">1.</span><p><span class="cl">(Mishnah):</span> Chisaron in the skin is not a Mum. (This is because it can heal!)</p></div>
<div class="indent1"><span class="nm">(n)</span><p><span class="cl">Answer #1:</span> Logic teaches that this is not a Mum:</p></div>
<div class="indent2"><span class="nm">1.</span><p>An animal with a Mum Over cannot be redeemed. All the more so one cannot slaughter it!</p></div>
<div class="indent2"><span class="nm">2.</span><p><span class="cl">(Beraisa):</span> "V'Im Kol <i>Behemah Temei'ah </i>Asher Lo Yakrivu Mimenu Korban la'Shem" refers to a Ba'al Mum that was redeemed.</p></div>
<div class="indent3"><span class="nm">i.</span><p><span class="cl">Suggestion:</span> Perhaps it truly refers to a Tamei (species of) Behemah!</p></div>
<div class="indent3"><span class="nm">ii.</span><p><span class="cl">Rejection:</span> "V'Im ba'Behemah ha'Temei'ah u'Fadah v'Erkecha" discusses a Tamei Behemah. "V'Im Kol Behemah Temei'ah " must refer to a Ba'al Mum that was redeemed.</p></div>
<div class="indent2"><span class="nm">3.</span><p><span class="cl">Suggestion:</span> Perhaps a Zevach may be redeemed if it has a Mum Over!</p></div>
<div class="indent2"><span class="nm">4.</span><p><span class="cl">Rejection:</span> "Asher Lo Yakrivu Mimenu Korban la'Shem" is something that can never be offered. This excludes a Ba'al Mum Over, for it may be offered later.</p></div>
<div class="indent1"><span class="nm">(o)</span><p><span class="cl">Answer #2:</span> The Peratim (or Mi'utim) "Pise'ach Oh Iver" exclude a Mum Over.</p></div>
<div class="subject"><span class="nm">4)</span><p>THE SHI'UR OF MUMIM</p></div>
<div class="indent1"><span class="nm">(a)</span><p><span class="cl">(Mishnah):</span> It is cracked, even if nothing is missing.</p></div>
<div class="indent1"><span class="nm">(b)</span><p><span class="cl">(Beraisa):</span> A crack of any size is a Mum. Chisaron is a Mum, whether it came b'Yedei Adam (through man) or b'Yedei Shamayim.</p></div>
<div class="indent1"><span class="nm">(c)</span><p><span class="cl">Objection:</span> This implies that a crack b'Yedei Shamayim is not a Mum. (Surely, this is not so!)</p></div>

<div class="indent2"><span class="nm">5.</span><p><span class="cl">Chachamim:</span> A Kohen may not be Nirtza because this is a Mum. A hole in the lobe is not a Mum!</p></div>
<div class="indent3"><span class="nm">i.</span><p>Rather, it is pierced through the upper part (cartilage. R. Yosi b'Rebbi Yehudah must hold that a needle makes a Mum, even though the hole is smaller than a lentil!)</p></div>
<div class="indent1"><span class="nm">(b)</span><p><span class="cl">Answer (Rav Huna bar Katina):</span> A lentil-sized hole is required to slaughter (outside the Mikdash). A smaller hole disqualifies from Hakravah.</p></div>
<div class="indent1"><span class="nm">(c)</span><p><span class="cl">Question:</span> What is Karshinah?</p></div>

<div class="indent1"><span class="nm">(f)</span><p><span class="cl">Answer (Rav Huna Rabah):</span> I did not hear about this, but we can learn from a Mishnah:</p></div>
<div class="indent2"><span class="nm">1.</span><p><span class="cl">(Mishnah - Beis Shamai):</span> A spine missing two vertebrae does not have Tum'as Ohel (to be Metamei everything the same roof as it);</p></div>

<div class="indent2"><span class="nm">6.</span><p><span class="cl">Answer (Rav Tachlifa bar Avodimi citing Shmuel):</span> A hole the size of a Sela (a coin) would cause one to die.</p></div>
<div class="indent1"><span class="nm">(g)</span><p><span class="cl">Rav Safra:</span> This teaching (the size of the hole) was from the Amora'im (Shmuel).</p></div>

<div class="indent2"><span class="nm">1.</span><p><span class="cl">(Mishnah):</span> If an opening in a wall was not made by man, it must be the size of a big fist to allow Tum'as Mes to pass to the other side;</p></div>
