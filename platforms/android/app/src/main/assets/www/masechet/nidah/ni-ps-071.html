<p class="bas subject"><span class="nm">1)</span>HOW TO HAVE MALE CHILDREN</p>
<p class="bas indent1"><span class="nm">(a)</span><span class="cl">Question #3:</span> What should one do in order to have male children?</p>
<p class="bas indent1"><span class="nm">(b)</span><span class="cl">Answer (R. Yehoshua):</span> He should sanctify himself at the time of Bi'ah.</p>
<p class="bas indent1"><span class="nm">(c)</span><span class="cl">The Alexandrians:</span> Many did so, and it did not work!</p>
<p class="bas indent1"><span class="nm">(d)</span><span class="cl">R. Yehoshua:</span> He should request mercy from the One who gives sons -- "Hineh Nachalas Hash-m Banim Sachar Pri ha'Baten."</p>
<p class="bas indent1"><span class="nm">(e)</span><span class="cl">Question:</span> What do we learn from this?</p>
<p class="bas indent1"><span class="nm">(f)</span><span class="cl">Answer:</span> It teaches that neither will work without the other.</p>
<p class="bas indent1"><span class="nm">(g)</span><span class="cl">Question:</span> What do we learn from "Sachar Pri ha'Baten"?</p>
<p class="bas indent1"><span class="nm">(h)</span><span class="cl">Answer (Rav Chama bar Chanina):</span> If a man delays Hazra'ah while on his wife's stomach, in order that she will be Mazri'ah first, Hash-m rewards him with fruit of the stomach (sons).</p>
<p class="bas subject"><span class="nm">2)</span><i>TUM'AH</i> BEFORE DEATH</p>
<p class="bas indent1"><span class="nm">(a)</span><span class="cl">(Mishnah - Beis Shamai):</span> (Every dead woman is considered Nidah.)</p>
<p class="bas indent1"><span class="nm">(b)</span><span class="cl">Question:</span> What is the reason?</p>
<p class="bas indent1"><span class="nm">(c)</span><span class="cl">Answer #1:</span> Rav taught that "va'Tischalchal ha'Malkah" teaches that Esther became Nidah (due to fear). Likewise, a woman becomes Nidah before dying, for she sees the angel of death, and is afraid!</p>
<p class="bas indent1"><span class="nm">(d)</span><span class="cl">Question (Mishnah):</span> Fear inhibits Dam (Nidah).</p>
<p class="bas indent1"><span class="nm">(e)</span><span class="cl">Answer:</span> Prolonged fear inhibits the blood. Sudden terror induces it.</p>
<p class="bas indent1"><span class="nm">(f)</span><span class="cl">Objection (Beraisa - Beis Shamai):</span> Every dead man is considered a Zav;</p>
<p class="bas indent2"><span class="nm">1.</span>Beis Hillel says, only one who died a Zav is a Zav.</p>
<p class="bas indent2"><span class="nm">2.</span>Even if terror of seeing the angel of death induces Zov, he would not be a Zav. One becomes a Zav if he sees "mi'Besaro," but not due to Ones!</p>
<p class="bas indent1"><span class="nm">(g)</span><span class="cl">Answer #2 (to Question (j)):</span> Rather, Beis Shamai makes a decree. (Tosfos - all agree to the following decree, Beis Shamai extends it to Even Mesama):</p>
<p class="bas indent2"><span class="nm">1.</span><span class="cl">(Beraisa):</span> At first, they would immerse Kelim used by Nidos shortly before they died. Living Nidos were embarrassed (that they will be different even after death), so they enacted to immerse Kelim of all women, for the dignity of living Nidos.</p>
<p class="bas indent2"><span class="nm">2.</span>At first, they would immerse Kelim used by Zavim shortly before they died. Living Zavim were embarrassed, so they enacted to immerse Kelim of all men, for the dignity of living Zavim.</p>
<p class="bas subject"><span class="nm">3)</span>BLOOD THAT COMES OUT AFTER DEATH</p>
<p class="bas indent1"><span class="nm">(a)</span><span class="cl">(Mishnah):</span> If a Nidah died and (afterwards) a Revi'is of blood came out, it is Metamei due to Kesem (Dam Nidah; even a drop has Tum'as Maga and Masa) and Ohel (like blood of a Mes);</p>
<p class="bas indent1"><span class="nm">(b)</span>R. Yehudah says, it is not Metamei due to Kesem, because it did not leave (the Makor) until after death.</p>
<p class="bas indent1"><span class="nm">(c)</span>R. Yehudah agrees about a woman who sat on the birthing stool (she was about to gave birth), that if a Revi'is came out it is Metamei (also) due to Kesem. (Surely, at least a drop left the Makor before death.)</p>
<p class="bas indent1"><span class="nm">(d)</span>R. Yosi says, therefore, it is not Metamei b'Ohel.</p>
<p class="bas indent1"><span class="nm">(e)</span><span class="cl">(Gemara) Question:</span> (From R. Yehudah, we learn that) the first Tana holds that even though the blood left (the Makor) after death, it is Metamei due to Kesem! (This is unreasonable.)</p>
<p class="bas indent1"><span class="nm">(f)</span><span class="cl">Answer (Ze'iri):</span> The first Tana holds that Makom Makor Tamei. (Blood from the Makor that is not Dam Nidah is Tamei.) R. Yehudah disagrees.</p>
<p class="bas indent1"><span class="nm">(g)</span><span class="cl">(Mishnah):</span> R. Yehudah agrees...</p>
<p class="bas indent1"><span class="nm">(h)</span><span class="cl">(Gemara) Question:</span> (From R. Yehudah, we learn that) the first Tana holds that the blood is also Metamei b'Ohel! (This is unreasonable. If it is Dam Nidah, it is not Dam Mes.)</p>
<p class="bas indent1"><span class="nm">(i)</span><span class="cl">Answer (Rav Yehudah):</span> They argue about Dam Tevusah:</p>
<p class="bas indent2"><span class="nm">1.</span><span class="cl">(Beraisa - R. Eliezer b'Rebbi Yehudah):</span> If a man was killed, and we do not know whether the blood came out before or after death or partially before and partially after, this is Dam Tevusah. (It is is Tamei mid'Rabanan);</p>
<p class="bas indent2"><span class="nm">2.</span>Chachamim say, such blood is Tamei (mid'Oraisa) in Reshus ha'Yachid (perhaps all of it came out after death) and Tahor in Reshus ha'Rabim. (Perhaps all came out before death. Rashi - Tum'as Dam Tevusah is only mid'Rabanan even in Reshus ha'Yachid. Tosfos ha'Rosh - Dam Tevusah is Tamei (mid'Rabanan) even in Reshus ha'Rabim.)</p>
<p class="bas indent3"><span class="nm">i.</span>Rather, if a Revi'is of blood came out, partially before and partially after, and we do not know when the majority came out, this is Dam Tevusah;</p>
<p class="bas indent2"><span class="nm">3.</span>R. Yehudah says, if someone died on a bed and a Revi'is of blood was dripping (before and after death) into a cavity, it is Tamei, for the drop (that came out at the time) of death is mixed in. (Tum'ah mid'Oraisa requires a Revi'is after death. Mid'Rabanan we are stringent when at least some was after death.)</p>
<p class="bas indent2"><span class="nm">4.</span>Chachamim are Metaher, because every drop (after death) is Batel when it is mixed with a majority that came out before death.</p>
<p class="bas bbbline">71b----------------------------------------71b</p>
<p class="bas indent2"><span class="nm">5.</span>R. Yehudah is consistent with his opinion that blood is never Batel in blood.</p>
<p class="bas indent2"><span class="nm">6.</span>R. Shimon says, if blood was flowing from someone hanging on wood, and a Revi'is collected, it is Tamei;</p>
<p class="bas indent2"><span class="nm">7.</span>R. Yehudah is Metaher. Perhaps the drop of death remained on the wood.</p>
<p class="bas indent2"><span class="nm">8.</span><span class="cl">Question:</span> R. Yehudah should be Metaher also in his case (one who died on a bed) for the same reason!</p>
<p class="bas indent2"><span class="nm">9.</span><span class="cl">Answer:</span> A bed shakes, so the blood would not cling to it.</p>
<p class="bas subject"><span class="nm">4)</span>A WOMAN DURING <i>YEMEI TOHAR</i></p>
<p class="bas indent1"><span class="nm">(a)</span><span class="cl">(Mishnah):</span> (When a Tamei person immerses, he becomes Tahor regarding Chulin and Ma'aser, but he is not Tahor regarding Terumah and Kodshim until night. He is called a Tevul Yom.) At first, they used to say that a Yoledes (who immersed after her days of Tum'ah) during Yemei Tohar (she is like a Tevul Yom until the end of Yemei Tohar, 40 or 80 days after the birth of a boy or girl) may pour water over the (Korban) Pesach (to clean it);</p>
<p class="bas indent1"><span class="nm">(b)</span>Beis Hillel says, they retracted to say that regarding Kodshim she is (a Rishon l'Tum'ah,) like a Maga (one who touched someone who is) Tamei Mes;</p>
<p class="bas indent1"><span class="nm">(c)</span>Beis Shamai says, she is like a Tamei Mes.</p>
<p class="bas indent1"><span class="nm">(d)</span><span class="cl">(Gemara) Inference:</span> She may <i>pour</i> water over the Pesach (from a Kli), but she may not touch the water (for she would be Metamei it, even though it is Chulin). This implies that Chulin Al Taharas ha'Kodesh (one guards its Taharah like Kodesh) is like Kodesh;</p>
<p class="bas indent1"><span class="nm">(e)</span><span class="cl">(Seifa):</span> They retracted to say that regarding Kodshim she is like Maga Tamei Mes.</p>
<p class="bas indent2"><span class="nm">1.</span><span class="cl">Inference:</span> She is a Rishon only regarding (real) Kodshim, but not for Chulin Al Taharas ha'Kodesh, for it is unlike Kodesh! (This was the retraction. Eliyah Rabah - at first she was allowed to pour. Even if she would touch drops of water on the outside, they would not be Metamei the Kli. After the retraction, she may not pour, for if she would touch water on the outside, it would be Metamei the Kli.)</p>
<p class="bas indent1"><span class="nm">(f)</span>Our Mishnah is like Aba Sha'ul;</p>
<p class="bas indent2"><span class="nm">1.</span><span class="cl">(Beraisa - Aba Sha'ul):</span> A Tevul Yom is like a Rishon regarding Kodesh. (If Kodshim foods are in a row, touching each other, and he touches Kodesh on the end) he is <i>Metamei</i> two foods (disqualifies them, and enables them to disqualify other foods) and disqualifies one. (What he touches becomes a Sheni. What it touches becomes a Shelishi. The third in line is a Revi'i. It is Pasul, but it does not disqualify other Kodshim.)</p>
<p class="bas indent1"><span class="nm">(g)</span><span class="cl">(Mishnah):</span> All agree that she may eat Ma'aser (Sheni) and separate (a piece of dough to become) Chalah (which has all the laws of Terumah):</p>
<p class="bas indent2"><span class="nm">1.</span>She puts the piece in a Kli, puts it near (Rashi; Ramban - touches it to) the rest of the dough (Rambam - she makes a wall surrounding both of them), and declares that it is Chalah.</p>
<p class="bas indent1"><span class="nm">(h)</span>If her saliva or Dam Tohar fell on a loaf of Terumah, the loaf is Tahor.</p>
<p class="bas indent1"><span class="nm">(i)</span>Beis Shamai says, she must immerse at the end of Yemei Tohar (before eating Terumah);</p>
<p class="bas indent1"><span class="nm">(j)</span>Beis Hillel does not require her to immerse again (for Terumah. They agree that she must immerse again before eating Kodshim.)</p>
<p class="bas indent1"><span class="nm">(k)</span><span class="cl">(Gemara):</span> (She may eat Ma'aser, for she is like a Tevul Yom, and it was taught that) if a Tamei person immerses, he may eat Ma'aser immediately. (He need not wait until night.)</p>
<p class="bas indent1"><span class="nm">(l)</span><span class="cl">(Mishnah):</span> She may separate Chalah.</p>
<p class="bas indent2"><span class="nm">1.</span>This teaches that Chulin that is Tevel to Chalah (Chalah must be separated from it) is unlike Terumah. (If it were like Terumah, she would be Metamei the dough.)</p>
<p class="bas indent1"><span class="nm">(m)</span><span class="cl">(Mishnah):</span> She puts it near the rest of the dough.</p>
<p class="bas indent1"><span class="nm">(n)</span>This is as we learned elsewhere, that l'Chatchilah one must declare Chalah when it is near (Rambam - in the same enclosure with) the rest of the dough.</p>
<p class="bas indent1"><span class="nm">(o)</span><span class="cl">(Mishnah):</span> She declares it to be Chalah.</p>
<p class="bas indent2"><span class="nm">1.</span>One might have thought that we decree to forbid this, lest she touch it (after making it Chalah). The Mishnah teaches that we do not decree.</p>
<p class="bas indent1"><span class="nm">(p)</span><span class="cl">(Mishnah):</span> Her saliva (or Dam Tohar is not Posel Terumah).</p>
<p class="bas indent1"><span class="nm">(q)</span><span class="cl">(Mishnah):</span> Fluids that exude from a Tevul Yom are like liquids (of Terumah) that he touches. Neither of them are Metamei (Kodshim, but they are Posel Kodshim), except for fluids of a Zav. (They are an Av ha'Tum'ah. The Gra deletes this.)</p>
<p class="bas indent1"><span class="nm">(r)</span><span class="cl">(Mishnah - Beis Shamai):</span> (She must immerse at the end of Yemei Tohar... )</p>
<p class="bas indent1"><span class="nm">(s)</span><span class="cl">Question:</span> What do Beis Hillel and Beis Shamai argue about?</p>
<p class="bas indent1"><span class="nm">(t)</span><span class="cl">Answer (Rav Katina):</span> They argue about a Tevulas Yom Aruch. (There is a long delay from her immersion until she may eat Terumah (33 or 66 days), therefore Beis Shamai is concerned lest she has not been guarding herself from Tum'ah.)</p>
<p class="bas subject"><span class="nm">5)</span>BI'AH DURING <i>YEMEI SHIMUR</i></p>
<p class="bas indent1"><span class="nm">(a)</span><span class="cl">(Mishnah - Beis Shamai):</span> If a woman saw on day 11 (of Zivah), immersed that night and had Bi'ah, (her husband was Bo'el Nidah, so he is Tamei like a Nidah,) they are Metamei a Mishkav or Moshav (to be an Av ha'Tum'ah), and they are Chayav Chatas;</p>
