<div class="subject"><span class="nm">1)</span><p>MERITS OF AVRAHAM</p></div>
<div class="indent1"><span class="nm">(a)</span><p><span class="cl">(Rava):</span> In the merit that Avraham said "from a string to a shoe strap (I will not take the spoils of Sedom)", his descendants merited two Mitzvos, Techeles (on Tzitzis) and straps of Tefilin.</p></div>
<div class="indent2"><span class="nm">1.</span><p>Tefilin has special benefit - "all the nations will see that Hash-m's Name is called on you";</p></div>
<div class="indent2"><span class="nm">2.</span><p><span class="cl">(Beraisa - R. Eliezer):</span> This refers to the head Tefilin.</p></div>
<div class="indent1"><span class="nm">(b)</span><p><span class="cl">Question:</span> What special benefit is there from Techeles?</p></div>
<div class="indent1"><span class="nm">(c)</span><p><span class="cl">Answer (Beraisa - R. Meir):</span> Techeles was chosen for Tzitzis, because it resembles the sea, which resembles the sky, which resembles the sapphire stone, which resembles Hash-m's Throne of Glory. (Rashi - whenever Hash-m looks at His Kisei, He recalls Yisrael's merit for this Mitzvah; Maharsha - whenever a Yisrael looks at his Techeles, he is reminded not to sin and cause a breach between the lower, intermediate and upper worlds.)</p></div>
<div class="indent1"><span class="nm">(d)</span><p><span class="cl">(R. Aba):</span> It is very hard to (recognize the need to) compensate for stolen property that has been consumed. Avraham refused the spoils (of Sedom), but he did not return what was eaten - "I will not take, only what the youths ate".</p></div>
<div class="indent1"><span class="nm">(e)</span><p><span class="cl">(R. Yosi ha'Gelili):</span> "Lo mi'Rubchem... (Ki Atem ha'M'at)" - Hash-m loves Yisrael because when He gives them greatness, they humble themselves in front of Him.</p></div>
<div class="indent2"><span class="nm">1.</span><p>Hash-m gave greatness to Avraham. Avraham said "I am earth and ashes";</p></div>
<div class="indent2"><span class="nm">2.</span><p>Moshe and Aharon said "what are we?";</p></div>
<div class="indent2"><span class="nm">3.</span><p>David said "I am a worm, and not a man".</p></div>
<div class="indent1"><span class="nm">(f)</span><p>Nochrim become haughty when they are raised;</p></div>
<div class="indent2"><span class="nm">1.</span><p>Nimrod became great. He said "let us build a city" (and a tower, to fight Hash-m);</p></div>
<div class="indent2"><span class="nm">2.</span><p>Paro said "Who is Hash-m?"</p></div>
<div class="indent2"><span class="nm">3.</span><p>Sancheriv said "who among all the gods... (also Hash-m cannot save Yerushalayim from me)";</p></div>
<div class="indent2"><span class="nm">4.</span><p>Nebuchadnetzar said "I will rise to the heights of the clouds (I will resemble the Supreme)";</p></div>
<div class="indent2"><span class="nm">5.</span><p>Chiram, king of Tzur said "I sat in the dwelling of Hash-m, in the heart of the sea."</p></div>
<div class="indent1"><span class="nm">(g)</span><p><span class="cl">(Rava):</span> Moshe and Aharon showed more humility than Avraham. Avraham considered himself to be something, Moshe and Aharon did not considered themselves to be anything.</p></div>
<div class="indent1"><span class="nm">(h)</span><p><span class="cl">(Rava):</span> The world exists in the merit of people like Moshe and Aharon - "Toleh Eretz Al Blimah" (one who considers himself Bli Mah, i.e. nothing. They said "v'Nachnu Mah".)</p></div>
<div class="indent1"><span class="nm">(i)</span><p><span class="cl">(R. Ilai):</span> "Toleh Eretz Al Blimah" - the world exists in the merit of people who are Bolem (seal) the mouth at the time of an argument.</p></div>
<div class="indent1"><span class="nm">(j)</span><p><span class="cl">(R. Avahu):</span> The world exists in the merit of people that view themselves like nothing - "(those who put themselves) below (everyone else, they are) the mighty ones of the world".</p></div>
<div class="indent1"><span class="nm">(k)</span><p><span class="cl">(R. Yitzchak):</span> "Ha'Umnam (will you really) be silent? You should speak Tzedek, judge people Meisharim (straightly)" - one's Umnus (profession) in this world is to make himself like a mute;</p></div>
<div class="indent2"><span class="nm">1.</span><p><span class="cl">Suggestion:</span> Perhaps this applies even to Torah!</p></div>
<div class="indent2"><span class="nm">2.</span><p><span class="cl">Rejection:</span> "You should speak Tzedek."</p></div>
<div class="indent2"><span class="nm">3.</span><p><span class="cl">Suggestion:</span> Perhaps he may become haughty!</p></div>
<div class="indent2"><span class="nm">4.</span><p><span class="cl">Rejection:</span> It says "Meisharim". (One should be like a Mishor, i.e. flat land.)</p></div>
<div class="subject"><span class="nm">2)</span><p>THINGS ONE MAY NOT BENEFIT FROM</p></div>
<div class="indent1"><span class="nm">(a)</span><p><span class="cl">(R. Ze'ira):</span> One may cover the blood with earth (i.e. ashes) of an Ir ha'Nidachas (a city burned because most of its inhabitants served idolatry).</p></div>
<div class="indent1"><span class="nm">(b)</span><p><span class="cl">Question:</span> Why is this permitted? One may not benefit from the city!</p></div>
<div class="indent1"><span class="nm">(c)</span><p><span class="cl">Answer #1 (Ze'iri):</span> R. Ze'ira refers to the soil (which is not forbidden);</p></div>
<div class="indent2"><span class="nm">1.</span><p>"You will gather all the property... and burn" refers only to things that can be immediately gathered and burned, but not soil, which must be uprooted first.</p></div>
<div class="indent1"><span class="nm">(d)</span><p><span class="cl">Answer #2 (Rava):</span> Using something for a Mitzvah is not considered benefit.</p></div>
<div class="indent1"><span class="nm">(e)</span><p><span class="cl">Question (Rav Rechumi - Beraisa):</span> One may not sound a Shofar of idolatry to fulfill the Mitzvah.</p></div>
<div class="indent2"><span class="nm">1.</span><p><span class="cl">Suggestion:</span> If one used it, he was not Yotzei.</p></div>
<div class="indent1"><span class="nm">(f)</span><p><span class="cl">Answer #1 (Ravina):</span> No, if he used it, he was Yotzei.</p></div>
<div class="indent1"><span class="nm">(g)</span><p><span class="cl">Question (Beraisa):</span> One may not take a Lulav of idolatry to fulfill the Mitzvah.</p></div>
<div class="indent2"><span class="nm">1.</span><p><span class="cl">Suggestion:</span> If one took it, he was not Yotzei.</p></div>
<div class="indent1"><span class="nm">(h)</span><p><span class="cl">Answer #1:</span> No. If he took it, he was Yotzei.</p></div>
<div class="indent1"><span class="nm">(i)</span><p><span class="cl">Rejection (Beraisa):</span> One is not Yotzei with a Shofar or Lulav of idolatry.</p></div>
<div class="indent1"><span class="nm">(j)</span><p><span class="cl">Answer #2 (Rav Ashi, to questions ((e) and (g)):</span> There is a Shi'ur (minimal required size) for a Shofar and Lulav. Since idolatry must be burned, it is not considered to have a Shi'ur;</p></div>
<div class="bbbline">89b----------------------------------------89b</p></div>
<div class="indent2"><span class="nm">1.</span><p>This does not apply to Kisuy ha'Dam. Ashes are fine for covering!</p></div>
<div class="perekline">PEREK GID HA'NASHEH</div>
<div class="subject"><span class="nm">3)</span><p>THE ISUR OF THE GID</p></div>
<div class="indent1"><span class="nm">(a)</span><p>The Isur of Gid ha'Nasheh (the sciatic nerve) applies in Eretz Yisrael and in Chutz La'aretz, when the Mikdash stands and when it does not, to Chulin and Kodshim, in Behemos and Chayos, in the right and left thighs;</p></div>
<div class="indent2"><span class="nm">1.</span><p>It does not apply to birds, because they don't have a Kaf (round end of the thigh).</p></div>
<div class="indent1"><span class="nm">(b)</span><p>It applies to a fetus;</p></div>
<div class="indent1"><span class="nm">(c)</span><p>R. Yehudah says, it does not apply to a fetus. Also the Chelev of a fetus is permitted.</p></div>
<div class="indent1"><span class="nm">(d)</span><p>R. Meir says, a butcher is not believed to say that he removed the Gid;</p></div>
<div class="indent1"><span class="nm">(e)</span><p>Chachamim say, he is believed about the Gid and about Chelev.</p></div>
<div class="indent1"><span class="nm">(f)</span><p><span class="cl">(Gemara) Question:</span> The Mishnah teaches that it applies to Kodshim. This is obvious. Why shouldn't it apply?!</p></div>
<div class="indent2"><span class="nm">1.</span><p><span class="cl">Suggestion:</span> The Tana holds that the Gid has taste (one who eats it benefits). Even though the Isur of Gid ha'Nasheh already forbids the Gid, the Isur of (benefit from) Kodshim is also Chal (takes effect) on it.</p></div>
<div class="indent2"><span class="nm">2.</span><p><span class="cl">Rejection:</span> If so, the Mishnah should (not say that the Isur of Gid applies to Kodshim, rather, it) say that the Isur of Kodshim applies to the Gid!</p></div>
<div class="indent1"><span class="nm">(g)</span><p><span class="cl">Answer #1:</span> Rather, the Tana holds that the Gid has no taste. In Kodshim, it is forbidden only due to the Isur of Gid ha'Nasheh, but the Isur of Kodshim does not apply to it.</p></div>
<div class="indent1"><span class="nm">(h)</span><p><span class="cl">Objection:</span> Another Mishnah in our Perek (which surely was taught by the same Tana) says that the Gid has taste!</p></div>
<div class="indent2"><span class="nm">1.</span><p><span class="cl">(Mishnah):</span> If a thigh was cooked with the Gid, and the meat absorbed taste of the Gid, it is forbidden.</p></div>
<div class="indent1"><span class="nm">(i)</span><p><span class="cl">Answer #2:</span> The Mishnah discusses offspring of Kodshim. The Tana holds that a fetus' Gid is prohibited and that a fetus inside a Kodesh animal is (already) Kodesh.</p></div>
<div class="indent2"><span class="nm">1.</span><p>Therefore, the Isurim of Kodshim and the Gid come simultaneously, and both take effect.</p></div>
<div class="indent1"><span class="nm">(j)</span><p><span class="cl">Question:</span> Since the Seifa discusses a fetus, surely the Reisha does not discuss a fetus!</p></div>
<div class="indent1"><span class="nm">(k)</span><p><span class="cl">Answer:</span> The Seifa explains that the previous law (that the Gid is forbidden in Kodshim) is like Chachamim, and not like R. Yehudah (for he permits the Gid of a fetus).</p></div>
<div class="indent1"><span class="nm">(l)</span><p><span class="cl">Question:</span> Chachamim hold that the Isurim of Kodshim and the Gid do not come simultaneously!</p></div>
<div class="indent2"><span class="nm">1.</span><p><span class="cl">(Mishnah):</span> If a Nazir became Tamei through any of the following he must be Megale'ach (shave and bring Korbanos Nazir Tamei, and begin Nezirus again):</p></div>
<div class="indent3"><span class="nm">i.</span><p>A Mes; a k'Zayis of a Mes...</p></div>
<div class="indent3"><span class="nm">ii.</span><p><span class="cl">Question:</span> If he must shave for (Tum'ah of) a k'Zayis of a Mes, all the more so for a (full) Mes!</p></div>
<div class="indent3"><span class="nm">iii.</span><p><span class="cl">Answer (R. Yochanan):</span> The Mishnah teaches about a Nefel (miscarriage) whose limbs are not tied with Gidin (and the entire body is less than a k'Zayis).</p></div>
<div class="indent2"><span class="nm">2.</span><p>This shows that the Isur Kodshim came first (for the Gidin are formed after the fetus).</p></div>
