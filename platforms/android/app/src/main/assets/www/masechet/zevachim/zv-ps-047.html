<div class="indent1"><span class="nm">(a)</span><p><span class="cl">(Mishnah):</span> Everything depends on the intent of the Oved.</p></div>
<div class="indent1"><span class="nm">(b)</span><p>Our Mishnah is not like R. Elazar b'Rebbi Yosi.</p></div>
<div class="indent2"><span class="nm">1.</span><p><span class="cl">(Beraisa - R. Elazar b'Rebbi Yosi):</span> Intent (Chutz) of the owner of a Korban is Mefagel.</p></div>
<div class="indent1"><span class="nm">(c)</span><p><span class="cl">(Rava):</span> He learns from "v'Hikriv ha'Makriv" (the owner is considered a Makriv, i.e. an Oved).</p></div>
<div class="indent1"><span class="nm">(d)</span><p><span class="cl">(Abaye):</span> All the following Tana'im are concerned for the intent of one who is not doing the action: R. Elazar b'Rebbi Yosi (like we explained), R. Eliezer and R. Shimon ben Elazar.</p></div>
<div class="indent2"><span class="nm">1.</span><p><span class="cl">(Mishnah):</span> If one slaughters for an idolater, the Shechitah is valid;</p></div>
<div class="indent3"><span class="nm">i.</span><p>R. Eliezer says, it is invalid. (We assume that the idolater intended that the Shechitah be for idolatry.)</p></div>
<div class="indent2"><span class="nm">2.</span><p><span class="cl">(Beraisa - R. Shimon ben Elazar):</span> The general rule is, if Reuven stored away something that most people would not store away (because it is repulsive, or too small to bother storing), and Shimon took it from Reshus ha'Yachid to Reshus ha'Rabim on Shabbos, he is liable (even if he considers it worthless) due to Reuven's intent.</p></div>
<div class="indent1"><span class="nm">(e)</span><p>R. Eliezer and R. Shimon ben Elazar both agree with R. Elazar b'Rebbi Yosi's law. They are concerned for a passive party's intent in Chulin, and all the more so regarding Kodshim, in which a verse teaches that the owner's intent counts!</p></div>
<div class="indent2"><span class="nm">1.</span><p>(Perhaps) R. Elazar b'Rebbi Yosi argues with the laws of R. Eliezer and R. Shimon ben Elazar. He discussed only Kodshim, for which we have a verse;</p></div>
<div class="indent2"><span class="nm">2.</span><p>R. Shimon ben Elazar agrees with R. Eliezer's law. R. Elazar considers the intent regarding Shabbos, and all the more so regarding idolatry, which is like Avodah (one is liable for Avodos of Kodshim done for idolatry)!</p></div>
<div class="indent2"><span class="nm">3.</span><p>R. Eliezer argues with R. Shimon's law. Laws of idolatry resemble Avodas ha'Mikdash, but the Torah forbids (on Shabbos) only Melachah with intent!</p></div>

<div class="subject"><span class="nm">2)</span><p>SHECHITAH AND MATANOS OF KODSHEI KODOSHIM</p></div>
<div class="indent1"><span class="nm">(a)</span><p><span class="cl">(Mishnah):</span> Kodshei Kodoshim are slaughtered in Tzafon (the north half of the Azarah).</p></div>
<div class="indent2"><span class="nm">1.</span><p>The Par and Sa'ir (inner Chata'os) of Yom Kipur are slaughtered in Tzafon. Kabalah must be in a Keli Shares in Tzafon;</p></div>
<div class="indent2"><span class="nm">2.</span><p>The blood must be sprinkled between the staves of the Aron, on the Paroches, and on the inner Mizbe'ach. all of these are Me'akev;</p></div>
<div class="indent3"><span class="nm">i.</span><p>The Shirayim (leftover blood) are poured on the Yesod on the west side of the outer Mizbe'ach. This is not Me'akev Kaparah.</p></div>
<div class="indent2"><span class="nm">3.</span><p>Parim and Se'irim ha'Nisrafim (inner Chata'os of a Mashu'ach or He'elem Davar) are slaughtered in Tzafon. Kabalah must be in a Keli Shares in Tzafon;</p></div>
<div class="indent2"><span class="nm">4.</span><p>The blood must be sprinkled on the Paroches and on the inner Mizbe'ach. All these Matanos are Me'akev;</p></div>

<div class="indent3"><span class="nm">i.</span><p>The Shirayim are poured on the Yesod on the west side of the outer Mizbe'ach. This is not Me'akev.</p></div>
<div class="indent2"><span class="nm">5.</span><p>All of these (inner Chata'os) are burned in Beis ha'Deshen (a place to the east of Yerushalayim where the ashes of the inner Mizbe'ach are deposited).</p></div>
<div class="subject"><span class="nm">3)</span><p>DOES <i>KABALAH</i> REQUIRE A KELI <i>SHARES</i>?</p></div>
<div class="indent1"><span class="nm">(a)</span><p><span class="cl">(Gemara) Question:</span> When the Tana gave the general rule of Kodshei Kodoshim (they are slaughtered in Tzafon), why didn't he also teach that Kabalah must be in a Keli Shares in Tzafon (like he teaches regarding each particular Korban of Kodshei Kodoshim)?</p></div>
<div class="indent1"><span class="nm">(b)</span><p><span class="cl">Answer:</span> He omitted this because it is not always true. The blood of Asham Metzora is received in the hand.</p></div>
<div class="indent1"><span class="nm">(c)</span><p><span class="cl">Objection:</span> This is wrong!</p></div>
<div class="indent2"><span class="nm">1.</span><p><span class="cl">(Mishnah):</span> ...The Asham of a Nazir or Metzora... is slaughtered in Tzafon. Kabalah must be in a Keli Shares in Tzafon...</p></div>
<div class="indent1"><span class="nm">(d)</span><p><span class="cl">Answer:</span> Initially, the Tana thought that all the blood is received in the hand, so he omitted Kabalah in a Keli Shares from the general rule;</p></div>
<div class="indent2"><span class="nm">1.</span><p>Later, he concluded that some of the blood is received in a Keli Shares, so he taught this in the Mishnah of Ashamos.</p></div>
<div class="indent2"><span class="nm">2.</span><p><span class="cl">(Beraisa) Suggestion:</span> "V'Lakach" - perhaps he receives the blood (of Asham Metzora) in a Keli!</p></div>
<div class="indent2"><span class="nm">3.</span><p><span class="cl">Rejection:</span> "V'Nosan" - just like the Kohen puts the blood (on the Metzora) himself (with his finger), he receives it himself (in his hand).</p></div>
<div class="indent2"><span class="nm">4.</span><p><span class="cl">Suggestion:</span> Perhaps he also receives in his hand the blood that will be put on the Mizbe'ach!</p></div>
<div class="indent2"><span class="nm">5.</span><p><span class="cl">Rejection:</span> "Ka'Chatas ha'Asham" - just like Kabalah of a Chatas must be in a Keli Shares, also of an Asham.</p></div>
<div class="indent2"><span class="nm">6.</span><p><span class="cl">Conclusion:</span> Two Kohanim must receive the blood of Asham Metzora. One receives in his hand, and one receives in a Keli;</p></div>
<div class="indent3"><span class="nm">i.</span><p>The former puts the blood (that he received) on the Metzora. The latter puts the blood on the Mizbe'ach.</p></div>
