<div class="subject"><span class="nm">1)</span><p>LOCATIONS AND DIMENSIONS IN THE MIKDASH</p></div>
<div class="indent1"><span class="nm">(a)</span><p>The Beraisa teaches the location of the Shulchan.</p></div>
<div class="indent2"><span class="nm">1.</span><p>It was within the 20 Amos closest to the Kodesh HaKadoshim.</p></div>
<div class="indent2"><span class="nm">2.</span><p>It was set away from the North wall 2.5 Amos.</p></div>
<div class="indent1"><span class="nm">(b)</span><p>The Beraisa goes on to locate the Menorah and the Mizbeach.</p></div>
<div class="indent2"><span class="nm">1.</span><p>The Menorah paralleled the Shulchan near the South wall.</p></div>
<div class="indent2"><span class="nm">2.</span><p>The Mizbeach was in the center, set away (to the East) from the direct line between the Menorah and the Shulchan.</p></div>
<div class="subject"><span class="nm">2)</span><p>THE TEN MENOROS OF SHLOMO</p></div>
<div class="indent1"><span class="nm">(a)</span><p><span class="cl">Question:</span> If they were placed five to the North and five to the South, then only the Southern ones would be Kosher!?</p></div>
<div class="indent1"><span class="nm">(b)</span><p><span class="cl">Answer:</span> It means five to the right and five to the left of the Menorah of Moshe.</p></div>
<div class="indent1"><span class="nm">(c)</span><p>There is the same dispute as regarding the Shulchanos as to which was used- only the one of Moshe or all (rotating).</p></div>
<div class="subject"><span class="nm">3)</span><p>USING UP THE GOLD</p></div>
<div class="indent1"><span class="nm">(a)</span><p>Michlos Zahav- they used up Shlomo's gold.</p></div>
<div class="indent1"><span class="nm">(b)</span><p>The gold was exceedingly refined (losing any impurities).</p></div>
<div class="indent1"><span class="nm">(c)</span><p><span class="cl">Question:</span> But the Beraisa teaches that the Menorah of Moshe could not be reduced by refining!?</p></div>
<div class="indent1"><span class="nm">(d)</span><p><span class="cl">Answer:</span> Indeed, once refined, it could not be further refined.</p></div>
<div class="subject"><span class="nm">4)</span><p>HALACHAH 4: THE THIRTEEN SHOFAROS</p></div>
<div class="indent1"><span class="nm">(a)</span><p>The 13 Shofaros were labeled as indicated.</p></div>
<div class="indent1"><span class="nm">(b)</span><p>The New Shekalim were of the current year.</p></div>
<div class="indent1"><span class="nm">(c)</span><p>One who had not brought one year, brought the next into the Shofar marked Old Shekalim.</p></div>
<div class="indent1"><span class="nm">(d)</span><p><span class="cl">(R. Yehudah):</span> Kinin are (large) birds while Gozelei Olah are (small) Bnei Yonah [all are Nidvei Olos- not obligations].</p></div>
<div class="indent1"><span class="nm">(e)</span><p><span class="cl">(Chachamim):</span> The Kinin Shofar received all Kinin (Chatas and Olah) while the one marked Gozelei Olah received only Olos.</p></div>
<div class="indent1"><span class="nm">(f)</span><p>The Mishnah lists the minimum amounts for various unspecified donations (wood, Levonah, and gold).</p></div>
<div class="indent1"><span class="nm">(g)</span><p>From the six Shofaros marked Nedavah they brought Olos (the meat went on the Mizbeach and the hides to the Kohanim).</p></div>
<div class="indent2"><span class="nm">1.</span><p>This was derived from the Pasuk by Yehoyadah.</p></div>
<div class="indent2"><span class="nm">2.</span><p>This resolves two seemingly contradictory Pesukim.</p></div>
<div class="subject"><span class="nm">5)</span><p>THE RATIONALE FOR R. YEHUDAH</p></div>
<div class="indent1"><span class="nm">(a)</span><p>There was no Shofar for obligatory Kinin.</p></div>
<div class="indent1"><span class="nm">(b)</span><p>We are afraid lest one of the donors died (invalidating the rest).</p></div>
<div class="indent1"><span class="nm">(c)</span><p><span class="cl">Question:</span> But the Beraisa says that the woman puts the money into the Shofaros and can then be assured that she is Tehorah!?</p></div>
<div class="bbbline">18b----------------------------------------18b</p></div>
<div class="indent1"><span class="nm">(d)</span><p><span class="cl">Answer:</span> R. Yehudah is speaking where we know that one of the owners died.</p></div>
<div class="indent1"><span class="nm">(e)</span><p><span class="cl">Question:</span> But Bereirah should resolve the matter!?</p></div>
<div class="indent1"><span class="nm">(f)</span><p><span class="cl">Answer:</span> R. Yehudah does not hold of Bereirah.</p></div>
<div class="subject"><span class="nm">6)</span><p>THE GIZAR OF WOOD</p></div>
<div class="indent1"><span class="nm">(a)</span><p><span class="cl">Question:</span> Does our Mishnah only obligate him to bring two if the donor was not specific, but if he specified one Gizar that would suffice?</p></div>
<div class="indent1"><span class="nm">(b)</span><p><span class="cl">Answer:</span> The Mishnah in Yoma indicates that each Gizar is a separate offering (a separate Kohen brought each).</p></div>
<div class="subject"><span class="nm">7)</span><p>THE AMOUNT OF WOOD IN A GIZAR</p></div>
<div class="indent1"><span class="nm">(a)</span><p><span class="cl">(R. Yehoshua b. Levy):</span> The Gizar was an Amah thick (using "smiling" Amos), by an Amah length (stinting Amah).</p></div>
<div class="indent1"><span class="nm">(b)</span><p><span class="cl">(R. Ami):</span> It was like a Tortani.</p></div>
<div class="indent1"><span class="nm">(c)</span><p>It was a stinting Amah long to allow room for the Kohanim on the Mizbeach.</p></div>
<div class="subject"><span class="nm">8)</span><p>LEVONAH NOT LESS THAN A KOMETZ</p></div>
<div class="indent1"><span class="nm">(a)</span><p>The source is the word Azkarah found by a donation of Levonah and by the Lechem HaPanim (both are a Kometz).</p></div>
<div class="indent1"><span class="nm">(b)</span><p><span class="cl">Question:</span> But the Lechem ha'Panim was doubled (two Kometzim)?</p></div>
<div class="indent2"><span class="nm">1.</span><p><span class="cl">Answer (R. Ila):</span> [According to our text] The Kometz of the Lechem ha'Panim was a separate offering (and the Minchas Choteh as well as the donated Levonah are both learned from it).</p></div>
<div class="indent2"><span class="nm">2.</span><p><span class="cl">(R. Yosah):</span> From R. Ila we learn that the donated Levonah must be the Kometz of a large Kohen.</p></div>
<div class="indent2"><span class="nm">3.</span><p><span class="cl">(R. Chizkiyah citing R. Yirmiyah):</span> An average person (since the donor is free to choose the Kohen).</p></div>
<div class="indent1"><span class="nm">(c)</span><p>The <b>GRA</b> understands the answer differently:</p></div>
<div class="indent2"><span class="nm">1.</span><p><span class="cl">Answer (R. Ila):</span> The donated Kometz is derived not from Lechem ha'Panim, but from other Menachos.</p></div>
<div class="indent2"><span class="nm">2.</span><p>(R. Yosah) The Kometz must match the hand of the Kohen.</p></div>
<div class="indent2"><span class="nm">3.</span><p>(R. Chizkiyah citing R. Yirmiyah) It may match the hand of the donor.</p></div>
<div class="subject"><span class="nm">9)</span><p>GOLD IS DONATED NOT LESS THAN A DINAR</p></div>
<div class="indent1"><span class="nm">(a)</span><p>The Dinar is required if the donor mentioned a coin.</p></div>
<div class="indent1"><span class="nm">(b)</span><p>If he did not specify a coin, then a small fork is enough.</p></div>
<div class="subject"><span class="nm">10)</span><p>SHOFAROS FOR NEDAVAH</p></div>
<div class="indent1"><span class="nm">(a)</span><p>There are four opinions as to the basis for six Shofaros.</p></div>
<div class="indent2"><span class="nm">1.</span><p>Chizkiyah - six Batei Avos.</p></div>
<div class="indent2"><span class="nm">2.</span><p>Bar Padyah - six types of animals for Korbanos.</p></div>
<div class="indent2"><span class="nm">3.</span><p>Shmuel - six types of Korbanos.</p></div>
<div class="indent2"><span class="nm">4.</span><p>R. Yochanan - to accommodate the large quantity of donations.</p></div>
<div class="indent1"><span class="nm">(b)</span><p><span class="cl">Question:</span> The Pasuk in Divrei Hayamim II (24:14) implies that the donations were used for K'lei Shares, whereas the Pasuk in Melachim II (12:14) implies not so?</p></div>
<div class="indent1"><span class="nm">(c)</span><p><span class="cl">Answer (R. Shmuel b. Nachmani):</span> There were two collections made by Yehoyada.</p></div>
<div class="indent1"><span class="nm">(d)</span><p><span class="cl">Answer (R. Yishmael):</span> It was one donation, with the surplus used for K'lei Shares as per the condition of Beis Din.</p></div>
<div class="indent1"><span class="nm">(e)</span><p><span class="cl">Question:</span> The Pasuk refers to two collection boxes?!</p></div>
<div class="indent1"><span class="nm">(f)</span><p><span class="cl">Answer:</span> It was one collection but a separate box was placed outside the Azarah for those who were Tamei.</p></div>
