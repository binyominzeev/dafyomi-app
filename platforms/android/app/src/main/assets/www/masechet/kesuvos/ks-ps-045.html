<p class="bas subject"><span class="nm">1)</span>THE PUNISHMENT FOR ADULTERY</p>
<p class="bas indent1"><span class="nm">(a)</span><span class="cl">(Shila - Beraisa):</span> There are three distinctions in the punishment of a girl that commits adultery:</p>
<p class="bas indent2"><span class="nm">1.</span>If after Nisu'in witnesses testify that she was Mezanah during Eirusin, she is stoned at her father's door;</p>
<p class="bas indent3"><span class="nm">i.</span>This publicizes that he raised an evil girl.</p>
<p class="bas indent2"><span class="nm">2.</span>If before Nisu'in witnesses testify that she had adultery during Eirusin, she is stoned at the gate of the city.</p>
<p class="bas indent2"><span class="nm">3.</span>If she sinned during Na'arus and became a Bogeres before the trial, she is strangled.</p>
<p class="bas indent1"><span class="nm">(b)</span><span class="cl">Inference:</span> When she undergoes a physical change, her sentence changes.</p>
<p class="bas indent1"><span class="nm">(c)</span><span class="cl">Contradiction (Beraisa):</span> If a Na'arah Me'orasah was Mezanah and after Bagrus her husband (made Nisu'in and) was Motzi Shem Ra on her, he is not lashed and does not pay 100 Shekalim. She and the Edim Zomemim (who testified falsely against her) are stoned.</p>
<p class="bas indent2"><span class="nm">1.</span><span class="cl">Objection:</span> We cannot kill her <i>and</i> the Edim Zomemim (if they lied, she is innocent)!</p>
<p class="bas indent2"><span class="nm">2.</span><span class="cl">Correction:</span> Rather, she <i>or</i> the Edim Zomemim are stoned.</p>
<p class="bas indent1"><span class="nm">(d)</span><span class="cl">Answer #1 (Rava):</span> One cannot ask a contradiction from Motzi Shem Ra. Motzi Shem Ra is a Chidush;</p>
<p class="bas indent2"><span class="nm">1.</span>Normally, if she had Nisu'in before the trial, her sentence changes to strangulation. Regarding Motzi Shem Ra, she is stoned.</p>
<p class="bas indent1"><span class="nm">(e)</span><span class="cl">Objection (Rav Huna brei d'Rav Yehoshua):</span> Perhaps the Torah says so only when she did not change physically, but when her body changed, also her sentence changed!</p>
<p class="bas indent1"><span class="nm">(f)</span><span class="cl">Answer #2 (Rav Nachman bar Yitzchak):</span> Tana'im argue about whether or not her sentence changes:</p>
<p class="bas indent2"><span class="nm">1.</span><span class="cl">(Mishnah):</span> If a man was Chayav Chatas for a sin and was then appointed (to be Nasi or Kohen Gadol), he brings the Chatas of a commoner;</p>
<p class="bas indent2"><span class="nm">2.</span>R. Shimon says, if he found out about his sin before he was appointed, he brings a Korban. If not, he is exempt.</p>
<p class="bas bbbline">45b----------------------------------------45b</p>
<p class="bas indent1"><span class="nm">(g)</span><span class="cl">Objection:</span> R. Shimon says that when he finds out affects the Korban. This does not show that he follows <i>only</i> the time he found out, and not the time of the sin!</p>
<p class="bas indent2"><span class="nm">1.</span>If he did, he should now bring the Chatas of a Kohen Gadol (or Nasi), i.e. a bull (or a goat)!</p>
<p class="bas indent1"><span class="nm">(h)</span><span class="cl">Support:</span> R. Yochanan said to correct the text of Shila's Beraisa to say that she is stoned (even if she is now a Bogeres. No Tana says that the Korban or death depends only on the new status.)</p>
<p class="bas indent1"><span class="nm">(i)</span><span class="cl">Question:</span> The Torah says that a <i>Na'arah</i> Me'orasah is stoned, not a Bogeres!</p>
<p class="bas indent1"><span class="nm">(j)</span><span class="cl">Answer (R. Ila'a):</span> "Ha'Na'arah" teaches that she was a Na'arah (when she sinned).</p>
<p class="bas indent1"><span class="nm">(k)</span><span class="cl">Question (R. Chananya):</span> If so, a man should be lashed and pay a fine (for Motzi Shem Ra on a Bogeres if he says that she sinned when she was a Na'arah)!</p>
<p class="bas indent2"><span class="nm">1.</span><span class="cl">R. Ila'a:</span> Heaven forbid such reasoning!</p>
<p class="bas indent2"><span class="nm">2.</span><span class="cl">R. Chananya:</span> No, Heaven forbid your reasoning!</p>
<p class="bas indent1"><span class="nm">(l)</span><span class="cl">Question:</span> What is R. Ila'a's reasoning?</p>
<p class="bas indent1"><span class="nm">(m)</span><span class="cl">Answer (R. Yitzchak bar Avin):</span> Her adultery condemns her; she was a Na'arah when she sinned. His speech obligates him; she was a Bogeres when he sinned.</p>
<p class="bas subject"><span class="nm">2)</span>WHERE WE STONE</p>
<p class="bas indent1"><span class="nm">(a)</span><span class="cl">(Beraisa):</span> If a Na'arah Me'orasah was Mezanah, she is stoned at her father's door. If there is none, she is stoned at the gate of the city;</p>
<p class="bas indent1"><span class="nm">(b)</span>If the majority of the city is Nochrim, she is stoned at the gate of Beis Din.</p>
<p class="bas indent1"><span class="nm">(c)</span>Similarly, one who serves idolatry is stoned at the gate of the city he sinned in;</p>
<p class="bas indent1"><span class="nm">(d)</span>If the city is mostly Nochrim, he is stoned at the gate of Beis Din.</p>
<p class="bas indent1"><span class="nm">(e)</span><span class="cl">Question:</span> What is the source of this?</p>
<p class="bas indent1"><span class="nm">(f)</span><span class="cl">(Beraisa):</span> "Your gates" refers to the gate where he served idolatry.</p>
<p class="bas indent2"><span class="nm">1.</span><span class="cl">Suggestion:</span> Perhaps it is the gate where he is judged!</p>
<p class="bas indent2"><span class="nm">2.</span><span class="cl">Rejection:</span> Above it says "Your gates", referring to where he sinned. Also here, "Your gates" refers to where he sinned.</p>
<p class="bas indent1"><span class="nm">(g)</span>Also, "Your gates" excludes the gates of Nochrim.</p>
<p class="bas indent1"><span class="nm">(h)</span><span class="cl">Question:</span> We already expounded this word!</p>
<p class="bas indent1"><span class="nm">(i)</span><span class="cl">Answer:</span> The Torah could have said "gate". Rather, it says "Your gates", so we can learn two laws.</p>
<p class="bas indent1"><span class="nm">(j)</span><span class="cl">Question:</span> This teaches about idolatry. What is the source for a Na'arah Me'orasah?</p>
<p class="bas indent1"><span class="nm">(k)</span><span class="cl">Answer (R. Avahu):</span> We learn "door" from "door" (regarding the Mishkan), and "door" from "gate", and "gate" from "Your gates" (regarding idolatry. Rashi - this is a mere Asmachta mid'Rabanan.)</p>
<p class="bas subject"><span class="nm">3)</span>IS <i>MOTZI</i> <i>SHEM</i> <i>RA</i> DEPENDENT ON <i>BI'AH</i>?</p>
<p class="bas indent1"><span class="nm">(a)</span><span class="cl">(Beraisa #1):</span> A Motzi Shem Ra is lashed and pays 100 Shekalim;</p>
<p class="bas indent1"><span class="nm">(b)</span>R. Yehudah says, he is lashed in every case. He pays 100 only if he had Bi'ah with his wife.</p>
<p class="bas indent1"><span class="nm">(c)</span><span class="cl">Version #1:</span> They argue just like R. Eliezer ben Yakov and Chachamim do (on Daf 46a).</p>
<p class="bas indent2"><span class="nm">1.</span>The first Tana says that whether or not he had Bi'ah, he is lashed and pays, like Chachamim. R. Yehudah says that he is always lashed, but he pays only if he had Bi'ah, like R. Eliezer ben Yakov.</p>
<p class="bas indent1"><span class="nm">(d)</span><span class="cl">Version #2:</span> Both Tana'im hold like R. Eliezer ben Yakov.</p>
<p class="bas indent2"><span class="nm">1.</span>The first Tana says that he is lashed and pays only if he had Bi'ah. R. Yehudah says that he is lashed in any case, but only pays if he had Bi'ah.</p>
<p class="bas indent1"><span class="nm">(e)</span><span class="cl">Question:</span> R. Yehudah does not hold that he is always lashed!</p>
<p class="bas indent2"><span class="nm">1.</span><span class="cl">(Beraisa #2 - R. Yehudah):</span> He is Lokeh (lashed) only if he had Bi'ah.</p>
<p class="bas indent1"><span class="nm">(f)</span><span class="cl">Answer #1 (Rav Nachman bar Yitzchak):</span> If he did not have Bi'ah he is lashed only mid'Rabanan.</p>
