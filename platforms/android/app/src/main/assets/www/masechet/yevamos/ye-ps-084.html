<p class="bas indent1"><span class="nm">(a)</span><span class="cl">Answer #2 (Rav Nachman bar Yitzchak - Beraisa - R. Eliezer):</span> The following animals do not become Kodesh or make Kodesh (this will be explained):</p>
<p class="bas indent2"><span class="nm">1.</span>A crossbred animal;</p>
<p class="bas indent2"><span class="nm">2.</span>A Tereifah (i.e. it has a mortal injury);</p>

<p class="bas indent2"><span class="nm">4.</span>A Tumtum or Androginus.</p>
<p class="bas indent2"><span class="nm">5.</span><span class="cl">(Shmuel):</span> It cannot become Kodesh, even through Temurah (if one said that it should be in place of a Korban). It does not make Kodesh through Temurah (even if it was born to a Korban and one said that another animal should be in place of it, the latter animal remains Chulin).</p>
<p class="bas indent1"><span class="nm">(b)</span><span class="cl">(Mishnah - R. Eliezer):</span> One is Chayav Skilah for Bi'ah with an Androginus like with a male.</p>

<p class="bas indent1"><span class="nm">(i)</span><span class="cl">(Gemara) Question:</span> Why does the Reisha discuss a regular Kohen who <i>married</i> a widow? Even if he was Mekadesh her she is forbidden to the Yavam (a Kohen Gadol)!</p>
<p class="bas indent2"><span class="nm">1.</span><span class="cl">Suggestion:</span> Because he married her, she is forbidden by an Aseh (she is not a virgin) and a Lav. Had he only been Mekadesh her, the Aseh of Yibum overrides the Lav of a widow to a Kohen Gadol.</p>
<p class="bas indent2"><span class="nm">2.</span><span class="cl">Rejection:</span> Our entire Perek discusses women forbidden only by a Lav, and the Aseh of Yibum does not override the Lav!</p>
<p class="bas indent1"><span class="nm">(j)</span><span class="cl">Answer #1:</span> The Seifa discusses a Kohen Gadol who married a widow (therefore we also taught Nisu'in in the Reisha);</p>
<p class="bas indent2"><span class="nm">1.</span>There, through Nisu'in he made her a Chalalah. Had he only been Mekadesh her, she would be permitted to the Yavam.</p>

<p class="bas indent2"><span class="nm">1.</span>This is only if he married her, and made her a Chalalah. Had he only been Mekadesh her, she would be permitted to his brother.</p>

<p class="bas subject"><span class="nm">3)</span>OMISSIONS OF THE <i>MISHNAH</i></p>
<p class="bas indent1"><span class="nm">(a)</span><span class="cl">Question (Rav Papa):</span> According to Rav Dimi, who said that the child of a (Mitzri) Sheni from a Rishonah is a Sheni, the Mishnah should also have taught the following case:</p>
<p class="bas indent2"><span class="nm">1.</span>If a Sheni married two Mitzriyos, a Rishonah and a Sheniyah, and had a son from each, they are a Sheni and a Shelishi, respectively;</p>
<p class="bas indent2"><span class="nm">2.</span>If one of the sons marry women proper for themselves (A Mitzris Sheniyah and Bas Yisrael, respectively), they (their wives) are permitted to their husbands and forbidden to their Yevamim. (Tosfos - really, the Sheniyah is permitted to both, for Kahal Gerim Lo Ikri Kahal. The Bas Yisrael is forbidden to her Yavam. Rashi explains like the simple meaning. The Rashash and Sha'ar ha'Melech questioned this.)</p>
<p class="bas indent2"><span class="nm">3.</span>If each son marries a woman proper for his brother, they are (Tosfos - the Bas Yisrael is) forbidden to their husbands and permitted their Yevamim;</p>
<p class="bas indent2"><span class="nm">4.</span>A convert is permitted to both [her husband and her Yavam]. An Ailonis [forbidden to her husband, e.g. a Sheniyah married to a Shelishi, or a Bas Yisrael to a Sheni) is forbidden to both.</p>
<p class="bas indent1"><span class="nm">(b)</span><span class="cl">Answer:</span> The Tana omitted this case.</p>
<p class="bas indent1"><span class="nm">(c)</span><span class="cl">Question:</span> If so, surely he omitted another case. What is it?</p>
<p class="bas indent1"><span class="nm">(d)</span><span class="cl">Answer:</span> He omitted a Petzu'a Daka.</p>
<p class="bas indent1"><span class="nm">(e)</span><span class="cl">Question:</span> This is not an omission. It is Chayavei Lavin, and Chayavei Lavin were already taught!</p>
<p class="bas indent1"><span class="nm">(f)</span><span class="cl">Answer:</span> Multiple cases of Chayavei Lavin were taught!</p>
<p class="bas indent1"><span class="nm">(g)</span><span class="cl">Support #1:</span> After teaching about a regular Kohen who married a widow, it also teaches a Chalal who married a Kesherah (even though the latter does not teach anything new).</p>
<p class="bas indent1"><span class="nm">(h)</span><span class="cl">Rejection:</span> No, that case is needed to teach Rav Yehudah's law:</p>
<p class="bas indent2"><span class="nm">1.</span><span class="cl">(Rav Yehudah):</span> A Kesherah (Bas Kohen) is permitted to a Chalal.</p>
<p class="bas indent1"><span class="nm">(i)</span><span class="cl">Support #2:</span> After teaching about a Chalal who married a Kesherah, it also teaches a Yisrael who married a Bas Yisrael and has a brother who is a Mamzer.</p>
<p class="bas indent1"><span class="nm">(j)</span><span class="cl">Objection:</span> No, it was necessary to teach Chayavei Lavin that are Shavah b'Chol (apply to all of Yisrael), and Lavim that are not (e.g. Isurei Kohanim).</p>
<p class="bas indent1"><span class="nm">(k)</span><span class="cl">Answer:</span> It also teaches about a Yisrael who married a Mamzeres and has a brother who is a Yisrael (this is also Shavah b'Chol)!</p>
<p class="bas indent1"><span class="nm">(l)</span><span class="cl">Conclusion:</span> This shows that extra cases were taught even if they teach nothing new. The Tana did not teach every case that could have been taught (so we can say that he also omitted Mitzri brothers).</p>

<p class="bas indent1"><span class="nm">(f)</span><span class="cl">Objection:</span> If so, 'he has a Kosher brother' also means that he is permitted to Kahal. This implies that a Chalal is forbidden to Kahal!</p>

<p class="bas indent1"><span class="nm">(g)</span><span class="cl">Rejection:</span> Not necessarily! One does not depend on the other!</p>
<p class="bas indent1"><span class="nm">(h)</span><span class="cl">Question (Ravin bar Nachman - Beraisa):</span> "Lo Yikachu (they will not marry)" is repeated, to teach that women are also commanded not to marry unfitting men.</p>
