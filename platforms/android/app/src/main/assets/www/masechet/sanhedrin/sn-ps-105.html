<p class="bas indent1"><span class="nm">(e)</span><span class="cl">Answer #1 (Rav):</span> Zecharyah told them 'do Teshuvah. "Avoseichem Ayei Hem" (your fathers who sinned, where are they?!)'</p>

You do not repent!)</p>
<p class="bas indent1"><span class="nm">(f)</span><span class="cl">Answer #2 (Shmuel):</span> Ten men sat in front of Yechezkeil (20:1). He told them to do Teshuvah;</p>
<p class="bas indent2"><span class="nm">1.</span><span class="cl">The men:</span> If a master sold his slave, or a husband divorced his wife, he has no more claim on him (or her. Likewise, Hash-m has no more claim on us!)</p>

<p class="bas indent2"><span class="nm">3.</span><span class="cl">Question (Reish Lakish):</span> Why is Nebuchadnetzar called "Avdi", just like David is?</p>
<p class="bas indent2"><span class="nm">4.</span><span class="cl">Answer:</span> Hash-m knew that Yisrael would say this (what the 10 men said), therefore He called Nebuchadnetzar a slave;</p>
<p class="bas indent3"><span class="nm">i.</span>If a slave acquires property, the slave and the property belong to the master. (Therefore, Yisrael still belong to Hash-m.)</p>

<p class="bas indent1"><span class="nm">(g)</span><span class="cl">Answer #3 (Rabah bar bar Chanah):</span> "Va'Yisru la'Mishpat..." - when Yeshayah told Yisrael to do Teshuvah, they said that the Yetzer ha'Ra rules over them;</p>

<p class="bas indent1"><span class="nm">(a)</span>The four commoners are Bil'am, Do'eg, Achitofel and Gechazi.</p>
<p class="bas indent1"><span class="nm">(b)</span>He is called Bil'am because he was b'Lo Am (he is not part of any nation). Alternatively, Balah (he confused) Am (Yisrael, causing us to sin with Benos Midyan);</p>
<p class="bas indent2"><span class="nm">1.</span>Ben Be'or - he had Bi'ah with Be'ir (an animal).</p>
<p class="bas indent1"><span class="nm">(c)</span>The real name of "Kushan Risha'sayim" was Lavan. He is called Kushan Risha'sayim because he did two evils to Yisrael:</p>
<p class="bas indent2"><span class="nm">1.</span>One was pursuing Yakov, with intent to destroy him. The other was in the time of the Shoftim (he conquered Yisrael).</p>
<p class="bas indent1"><span class="nm">(d)</span><span class="cl">Contradiction:</span> It says "Ben Be'or", and it says "Beno Ve'or"!</p>
<p class="bas indent1"><span class="nm">(e)</span><span class="cl">Resolution (R. Yochanan):</span> His father was like a son (i.e. inferior) to him in prophecy.</p>
<p class="bas indent1"><span class="nm">(f)</span><span class="cl">Inference:</span> Bil'am has no share in the world to come, but other Nochrim do. Our Mishnah is like R. Yehoshua;</p>
<p class="bas indent2"><span class="nm">1.</span><span class="cl">(Beraisa - R. Eliezer):</span> "Yashuvu Resha'im li'Sh'olah" refers to Yisrael Resha'im; "Kol Goyim Shecheichei Elokim" are Nochri Resha'im;</p>
<p class="bas indent2"><span class="nm">2.</span><span class="cl">R. Yehoshua:</span> It does not say '<i>b</i>'Chol (some texts - <i>k</i>'Chol) Goyim' (which would imply that all Nochrim have no share in the world to come). Rather, it says "Kol Goyim Shecheichei Elokim", i.e. the Resha'im among them.</p>
<p class="bas indent1"><span class="nm">(g)</span>Bil'am gave a sign that he has no share - "Tamos Nafshi Mos Yesharim." If I will die like Tzadikim (a normal death), this proves that I have a share in the world to come. If not, "I will go to (Gehinom, like) my nation."</p>
<p class="bas subject"><span class="nm">3)</span>BIL'AM</p>
<p class="bas indent1"><span class="nm">(a)</span><span class="cl">(Beraisa):</span> "Va'Yelchu Ziknei Mo'av v'Ziknei Midyan" - Mo'av and Midyan were always fighting. This is like two dogs that were always angry at each other. A wolf attacked one of them. The other reasoned 'if I do not help it now, the wolf will kill it and attack me tomorrow.' It helped the other dog to kill the wolf.</p>
<p class="bas indent2"><span class="nm">1.</span><span class="cl">(Rav Papa):</span> This is like people say, the weasel and the cat (which always fight) made a feast out of their unlucky victim.</p>
<p class="bas indent1"><span class="nm">(b)</span><span class="cl">Question:</span> "Va'Yeshvu Sarei Mo'av Im Bil'am" - what happened to the officers of Midyan?</p>
<p class="bas indent1"><span class="nm">(c)</span><span class="cl">Answer:</span> When Bil'am told them 'Linu... va'Hashivosi Eschem Davar" (I will see if Hash-m will allow me to go), they despaired. A father does not hate his children (surely, Hash-m will not let him go)!</p>
<p class="bas indent1"><span class="nm">(d)</span><span class="cl">(Rav Nachman):</span> Impudence works, even towards Hash-m. Initially, Hash-m told Bil'am "Lo Selech Imahem." After Bil'am persisted, He said "Lech Itam."</p>
<p class="bas indent2"><span class="nm">1.</span><span class="cl">(Rav Sheshes):</span> Impudence is a king without a crown (people fear the impudent) - "va'Anochi Melech veha'Anashim ha'Eleh Bnei Tzeruyah Kashim Mimeni."</p>
<p class="bas indent1"><span class="nm">(e)</span><span class="cl">(R. Yochanan):</span> "Va'Yelech Shefi" - Bil'am was lame in one foot;</p>
<p class="bas indent2"><span class="nm">1.</span>"Shefifun Alei Orach" refers to Shimshon. He was lame in both feet.</p>
<p class="bas indent1"><span class="nm">(f)</span>Bil'am was blind in one eye - "Shesum ha'Ayin."</p>
<p class="bas indent1"><span class="nm">(g)</span>Bil'am conjured with his Ever. He said about himself "Nofel u'Gluy Einayim", similar to "v'Haman Nofel Al ha'Mitah."</p>
<p class="bas indent1"><span class="nm">(h)</span><span class="cl">(Mar Zutra):</span> Bil'am conjured with his Ever (he learns from "v'Haman Nofel");</p>

<p class="bas indent2"><span class="nm">2.</span><span class="cl">Question:</span> Why does it say "v'Yode'a Da'as Elyon"? He did not even know his donkey's mind, how could he know Hash-m's?!</p>
<p class="bas indent3"><span class="nm">i.</span>When the Moabite nobles asked why he was riding on a donkey and not a horse, Bilam said that he left his horse grazing.</p>

<p class="bas indent2"><span class="nm">3.</span><span class="cl">Answer:</span> "V'Yode'a Da'as Elyon" teaches that Bilam knew when is the moment of Hash-m's fury.</p>

<p class="bas indent1"><span class="nm">(a)</span><span class="cl">(R. Elazar):</span> "Ami Zechor... u'Meh Onah Oso Bilam... Lema'an Da'as Tzidkos Hash-m" - we should know what Hash-m did for us. He was not angry for a moment during the entire time that Bilam was trying to curse us;</p>
<p class="bas indent2"><span class="nm">1.</span>Had He been angry, (Bilam would have succeeded to curse us, and) there would be no remnant of us.</p>
<p class="bas indent2"><span class="nm">2.</span>This explains "Mah Ekov Lo Kaboh Kel u'Mah Ez'om Lo Zo'am Hash-m."</p>
<p class="bas indent1"><span class="nm">(b)</span><span class="cl">Question:</span> What is the source that Hash-m's fury is a Rega?</p>

<p class="bas indent1"><span class="nm">(d)</span><span class="cl">Answer #2:</span> "Chavi Chim'at Rega Ad Ya'avor Zo'am."</p>
<p class="bas indent1"><span class="nm">(e)</span><span class="cl">Question:</span> When does this Rega come?</p>
<p class="bas indent1"><span class="nm">(f)</span><span class="cl">Answer (Abaye):</span> It is in the first three hours of the day, when a rooster's mane turns white.</p>
<p class="bas indent1"><span class="nm">(g)</span><span class="cl">Question:</span> Its mane is always white!</p>
<p class="bas indent1"><span class="nm">(h)</span><span class="cl">Answer:</span> All other times, it has red speckles. During the Rega, it is totally white.</p>
<p class="bas indent1"><span class="nm">(i)</span>A certain Min was bothering R. Yehoshua ben Levi with (perverted explanations of) verses. R. Yehoshua ben Levi set a rooster between the legs of his bed. He intended to curse him when the mane turned all white.</p>
<p class="bas indent2"><span class="nm">1.</span>At the time, R. Yehoshua ben Levi fell asleep. He realized that Hash-m did not want him to curse him - "v'Rachamav Al Kol Ma'asav";</p>
<p class="bas indent2"><span class="nm">2.</span>Also, it says "Gam Anosh la'Tzadik Lo Tov."</p>
<p class="bas indent1"><span class="nm">(j)</span><span class="cl">(Beraisa - R. Meir):</span> When kings put on their crowns and bow to the sun, immediately Hash-m gets angry.</p>

<p class="bas indent2"><span class="nm">1.</span>Hate overturns civilities. "Va'Yakam Bil'am ba'Boker va'Yachavosh Es Asono" - he saddled his own donkey to go to curse Yisrael.</p>
<p class="bas indent1"><span class="nm">(l)</span><span class="cl">(Rav Yehudah):</span> One should always engage in Torah and Mitzvos, even Lo Lishmah, for this will lead him to do them Lishmah.</p>
<p class="bas indent2"><span class="nm">1.</span>A reward for the 42 Korbanos that Balak brought (in order that Hash-m should allow Bil'am to curse Yisrael) was that he merited that Rus descend from him.</p>
<p class="bas indent2"><span class="nm">2.</span><span class="cl">(R. Yosi bar Chanina):</span> Rus was the daughter of Eglon, the grandson of Balak.</p>

<p class="bas indent3"><span class="nm">i.</span>We learn from Shlomo that he does not envy his son (therefore, it was a proper blessing that Shlomo be more exalted than David);</p>
<p class="bas indent3"><span class="nm">ii.</span>We can learn that he does not envy his Talmid from "vi'Hi Na Pi Shnayim b'Ru'chacha Elai" (Elisha asked his Rebbi (Eliyahu) for twice the Ru'ach (ha'Kodesh) of Eliyahu himself, and Eliyahu consented);</p>
<p class="bas indent3"><span class="nm">iii.</span>Alternatively, we learn from "va'Yismoch Es <i>Yadav</i> Alav." (Moshe was commanded to put one hand on Yehoshua (to pass Ru'ach to him), and he put both hands on him.)</p>

<p class="bas indent1"><span class="nm">(a)</span><span class="cl">(R. Elazar):</span> "Va'Yasem Hash-m Davar b'Fi Bil'am" - He appointed an angel over him;</p>

<p class="bas indent1"><span class="nm">(c)</span><span class="cl">(R. Yochanan):</span> From Bil'am's blessings, we can infer what he wanted to curse:</p>
<p class="bas indent1"><span class="nm">(d)</span>"Mah Tovu Ohalecha" - he wanted that we should not have Batei Keneses and Batei Medrash;</p>
<p class="bas indent2"><span class="nm">1.</span>"Mishkenosecha Yisrael" - he wanted that the Shechinah should not rest on them;</p>
<p class="bas indent2"><span class="nm">2.</span>"Ki'Nchalim Nitayu" - their kingdom should not last;</p>

<p class="bas indent1"><span class="nm">(e)</span><span class="cl">(R. Aba bar Kahana):</span> All of these reverted to curses, except for the blessing of Batei Keneses and Batei Medrash - "va'Yahafoch Es <i>ha'Klalah</i> li'Vrachah" (only one curse was permanently transformed to a blessing).</p>
<p class="bas indent1"><span class="nm">(f)</span><span class="cl">(R. Shmuel bar Nachmani):</span> "Ne'emanim Pitz'ei Ohev v'Ne'etaros Neshikos Sonei" - Achiyah ha'Shiloni's curse against Yisrael was better than Bil'am's blessings.</p>
<p class="bas indent2"><span class="nm">1.</span>Achiyah said "v'Hikah Hash-m Es Yisrael Ka'asher Yanud ha'Kaneh ba'Mayim (Yisrael should be stricken like a reed)";</p>
