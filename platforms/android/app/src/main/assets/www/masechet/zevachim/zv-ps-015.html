<div class="indent1"><span class="nm">(a)</span><p><span class="cl">(Ula):</span> Holachah without walking is not considered Holachah.</p></div>
<div class="indent1"><span class="nm">(b)</span><p><span class="cl">Question:</span> (According to Chachamim,) if a Kosher Kohen redoes the Holachah while walking, is the Korban Kosher?</p></div>
<div class="indent1"><span class="nm">(c)</span><p><span class="cl">Answer (Mishnah):</span> If a Kosher Kohen did Kabalah and gave it to a Pasul, he returns it to the Kosher Kohen.</p></div>
<div class="indent2"><span class="nm">1.</span><p>Even if this means (like we said above) that the Kosher Kohen takes it back (closer to the Mizbe'ach than he initially was), it shows that the Holachah can be fixed!</p></div>
<div class="indent1"><span class="nm">(d)</span><p><span class="cl">Rejection:</span> If the Pasul were closer to the Mizbeach (than the Kohen who gave it to him), this would indeed be a proof;</p></div>
<div class="indent2"><span class="nm">1.</span><p>However, perhaps the Pasul was further from the Mizbeach (so giving it to him was not Holachah at all)!</p></div>
<div class="indent1"><span class="nm">(e)</span><p><span class="cl">(Ula):</span> Holachah without walking is Pasul.</p></div>
<div class="indent2"><span class="nm">1.</span><p>(Since he already taught that is not considered Holachah,) this must mean that it cannot be fixed.</p></div>
<div class="indent1"><span class="nm">(f)</span><p><span class="cl">Question (Rav Nachman - Mishnah):</span> If blood fell from the Keli on the floor and it was gathered, it is Kosher (even though when it spills, some if it spreads out towards the Mizbeach, i.e. Holachah without walking! The Griz asked that R. Yehudah (34b) says that on Erev Pesach we gather blood from the floor and throw it. If the blood of a Korban spilled, this is Machshir it, even though it is mixed with (Pasul) Dam Tamtzis (blood that exudes before or after the animal dies). Chidushei Basra (220) says that Rashi there explains that this is because R. Yehudah holds that blood is not Mevatel blood. Indeed, R. Yehudah would hold that also here, the blood that spilled away from the Mizbe'ach is Kosher, even though it is mixed with (Pasul) blood that spilled towards the Mizbe'ach. We ask from Chachamim.)</p></div>
<div class="indent1"><span class="nm">(g)</span><p><span class="cl">Answer:</span> No. The case is, none of the blood spread towards the Mizbeach.</p></div>
<div class="indent1"><span class="nm">(h)</span><p><span class="cl">Question:</span> Surely, it spreads in all directions!</p></div>
<div class="indent1"><span class="nm">(i)</span><p><span class="cl">Answer #1:</span> No, it fell on an incline.</p></div>
<div class="indent1"><span class="nm">(j)</span><p><span class="cl">Answer #2:</span> It fell in a crevice.</p></div>
<div class="indent1"><span class="nm">(k)</span><p><span class="cl">Answer #3:</span> The blood was very thick, and almost congealed. It did not spread at all.</p></div>
<div class="indent1"><span class="nm">(l)</span><p><span class="cl">Objection #1:</span> It is unreasonable to say that the Tana taught about such unusual cases!</p></div>
<div class="indent1"><span class="nm">(m)</span><p><span class="cl">Objection #2 (Mishnah):</span> If blood fell (straight from the animal) onto the floor and it was gathered, it is Pasul.</p></div>
<div class="indent2"><span class="nm">1.</span><p>If in a normal case (when blood spilled from the Keli and some spread towards the Mizbeach) it is Pasul, the Tana should have taught this case instead (to show that sometimes it is Pasul even when it spilled from the Keli, which is a bigger Chidush)!</p></div>
<div class="indent2"><span class="nm">2.</span><p>Ula is refuted.</p></div>
<div class="indent1"><span class="nm">(n)</span><p>R. Shimon and Chachamim (explicitly argued about whether improper intent in Holachah disqualifies. They also) argue about whether Holachah without walking is considered Holachah.</p></div>
<div class="indent2"><span class="nm">1.</span><p>All agree that improper intent disqualifies in major Holachah (the Kabalah was far from the Mizbeach. Holachah through walking is needed);</p></div>
<div class="indent2"><span class="nm">2.</span><p>They argue about minor Holachah (the Kabalah was right by the Mizbeach. No walking is needed. Chachamim say that improper intent disqualifies, and R. Shimon says that it does not.)</p></div>
<div class="indent1"><span class="nm">(o)</span><p>Chachamim of Eretz Yisrael laughed at this. If so, according to R. Shimon, how does improper intent disqualify Haza'ah of Chatas ha'Of (shaking the bird to fling the blood towards the Mizbeach? We know that all agree that it disqualifies!)</p></div>
<div class="indent2"><span class="nm">1.</span><p>If the intent was before the blood left the neck, this has no effect!</p></div>
<div class="indent2"><span class="nm">2.</span><p>If the intent was after the blood left the neck, the Mitzvah was finished (surely, it has no effect)!</p></div>
<div class="indent1"><span class="nm">(p)</span><p><span class="cl">Suggestion:</span> He had improper intent while it was in the air. Really, the Mitzvah is not finished until the blood reaches the Mizbeach;</p></div>
<div class="indent2"><span class="nm">1.</span><p><span class="cl">Question (R. Yirmeyah):</span> If a Kohen was Mazeh and he his hand was cut off (so now he is blemished) before the blood reached the airspace of the Mizbeach, what is the law?</p></div>
<div class="indent2"><span class="nm">2.</span><p><span class="cl">Answer (R. Zeira):</span> It is Pasul.</p></div>
<div class="indent2"><span class="nm">3.</span><p><span class="cl">Question:</span> What is the reason?</p></div>
<div class="indent2"><span class="nm">4.</span><p><span class="cl">Answer:</span> We require "v'Hizah... v'Nasan." (The Haza'ah is completed when the blood reaches the Mizbeach.)</p></div>
<div class="indent1"><span class="nm">(q)</span><p><span class="cl">(Rav Papa):</span> (There is no difficulty from Chatas ha'Of. Rather,) they laughed because R. Shimon and Chachamim argued about major Holachah (R. Shimon is Machshir because one could have avoided it)!</p></div>
<div class="indent1"><span class="nm">(r)</span><p><span class="cl">Version #1:</span> Rather, all agree that minor Holachah disqualifies (because it is essential);</p></div>
<div class="indent1"><span class="nm">(s)</span><p><span class="cl">Version #2:</span> Rather, all agree that minor Holachah does not disqualify (because it is not considered Holachah) (end of Version #2);</p></div>

<div class="indent1"><span class="nm">(c)</span><p><span class="cl">(Rav Simi bar Ashi):</span> If a Kohen did Holachah and a Zar took it back and repeated the Holachah, the opinion that was Machshir (above) will disqualify here (for he considers the final Holachah to be primary). The opinion that disqualified above will be Machshir here (for he considers the first Holachah to be primary).</p></div>
<div class="indent1"><span class="nm">(d)</span><p><span class="cl">(Rava):</span> No, all agree that this is Pasul.</p></div>

<div class="indent2"><span class="nm">1.</span><p>A Zar, an Onen, a Tevul Yom (one who immersed today; he will be fully Tahor at nightfall);</p></div>
<div class="indent2"><span class="nm">2.</span><p>A Mechusar Kipurim (one whose Taharah is not complete until he brings a Korban), Mechusar Begadim (he is not wearing all the required garments), one who did not wash his hands and feet, an Arel (one who is uncircumcised);</p></div>
<div class="indent2"><span class="nm">3.</span><p>One who is Tamei, sitting down, or standing on top of Kelim or an animal or another person's feet.</p></div>
<div class="indent1"><span class="nm">(b)</span><p>If he was Mekbael with his left hand, it is Pasul;</p></div>

<div class="indent2"><span class="nm">3.</span><p><span class="cl">Rejection:</span> If a Nochri's Korban is Tamei, the Tzitz never makes it acceptable (even though it sometimes does for Korbanos of Yisrael). All the more so Korbanos of Nochrim may not be offered in Tum'ah!</p></div>
<div class="indent3"><span class="nm">i.</span><p>If a Nochri's Korban became Tamei, whether or not this happened intentionally, it is unacceptable.</p></div>
