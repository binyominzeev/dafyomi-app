<p class="bas subject"><span class="nm">1)</span>ACQUISITIONS THAT COULD NOT BE MADE NOW</p>
<p class="bas indent1"><span class="nm">(a)</span><span class="cl">(Abaye):</span> R. Eliezer ben Yakov, Rebbi and R. Meir all hold that one can stipulate to make an transaction in the future, even if the transaction could not be done now.</p>
<p class="bas indent1"><span class="nm">(b)</span>We explained R. Eliezer ben Yakov above;</p>
<p class="bas indent1"><span class="nm">(c)</span><span class="cl">(The source for Rebbi.) (Beraisa - Rebbi):</span> "Do not return a slave to his master" discusses one who bought a slave on condition to free him.</p>
<p class="bas indent2"><span class="nm">1.</span><span class="cl">Question:</span> What is the case?</p>
<p class="bas indent2"><span class="nm">2.</span><span class="cl">Answer (Rav Nachman bar Yitzchak):</span> He wrote a document to the slave saying 'when I buy you, you are acquired to yourself.'</p>
<p class="bas indent1"><span class="nm">(d)</span><span class="cl">(The source for R. Meir.) (Beraisa - R. Meir):</span> If now Sam cannot be Mekadesh Sally, and he stipulated that it take effect after any of the following, she is Mekudeshes then:</p>
<p class="bas indent2"><span class="nm">1.</span>He converts, or is freed;</p>
<p class="bas indent2"><span class="nm">2.</span>She converts or is freed;</p>
<p class="bas indent2"><span class="nm">3.</span>Her husband or her sister (Sam's wife) dies;</p>
<p class="bas indent2"><span class="nm">4.</span>She does Chalitzah.</p>
<p class="bas indent1"><span class="nm">(e)</span>R. Yochanan ha'Sandlar says, she is not Mekudeshes;</p>
<p class="bas indent1"><span class="nm">(f)</span>Rebbi Yehudah ha'Nasi says, letter of the law, she is Mekudeshes. Chachamim enacted that she is not (after her husband or sister dies), due to animosity (lest her husband or sister feel that Sally hopes he or she will die).</p>
<p class="bas indent1"><span class="nm">(g)</span><span class="cl">Question:</span> Abaye should also list Rebbi Yehudah ha'Nasi (for he agrees that the Kidushin works)!</p>
<p class="bas indent1"><span class="nm">(h)</span><span class="cl">Answer:</span> He did list him! Rebbi Yehudah ha'Nasi is Rebbi.</p>
<p class="bas indent1"><span class="nm">(i)</span><span class="cl">Question:</span> Abaye should also list R. Akiva!</p>
<p class="bas indent2"><span class="nm">1.</span><span class="cl">(Mishnah):</span> If a woman said to her husband 'what I produce is forbidden to you like a Korban', this vow need not be annulled. (Since she is obligated to work for him, she cannot forbid this);</p>
<p class="bas indent2"><span class="nm">2.</span>R. Akiva says, he should annul it, lest she produce more than she is obligated, and the vow will forbid the excess (even though there was no excess when she vowed).</p>
<p class="bas indent1"><span class="nm">(j)</span><span class="cl">Answer (Rav Huna Brei d'Rav Yehoshua):</span> The case is, she said 'my hands are Kodesh to their Maker.' Her hands are around at the time of the vow.</p>
<p class="bas subject"><span class="nm">2)</span>KIDUSHIN THROUGH WAGES</p>
<p class="bas indent1"><span class="nm">(a)</span><span class="cl">(Mishnah):</span> If one said 'you are Mekudeshes to me Al Menas that I will speak on your behalf to the governor', or 'Al Menas that I will work for you', she is Mekudeshes only if he did so.</p>
<p class="bas indent1"><span class="nm">(b)</span><span class="cl">(Gemara - Reish Lakish):</span> The case is, he gave her Kidushin money when he made this Tenai.</p>
<p class="bas indent1"><span class="nm">(c)</span><span class="cl">Question #1:</span> Why can she not be Mekudeshes solely through the value of his service?</p>
<p class="bas indent2"><span class="nm">1.</span><span class="cl">(Beraisa):</span> If one said 'you are Mekudeshes to me in lieu of payment for my letting you ride on the donkey (or in the wagon or ship)', she is Mekudeshes.</p>
<p class="bas indent2"><span class="nm">2.</span><span class="cl">Suggestion:</span> Perhaps there also, he also gave her Kidushin money.</p>
<p class="bas indent2"><span class="nm">3.</span><span class="cl">Rejection:</span> He said that the Kidushin is in lieu of payment.</p>
<p class="bas indent1"><span class="nm">(d)</span><span class="cl">Question #2 (Beraisa):</span> If a woman told a man 'keep me company, and I will be Mekudeshes to you' or 'jest in front of me', 'dance in front of me', or 'act for me like in a play', she is Mekudeshes only if we estimate that this is worth a Perutah.</p>
<p class="bas indent2"><span class="nm">1.</span>If also here, he also gave her Kidushin money, we would not need to evaluate his performance!</p>
<p class="bas indent2"><span class="nm">2.</span>This refutes Reish Lakish.</p>
<p class="bas indent1"><span class="nm">(e)</span><span class="cl">Answer (Reish Lakish):</span> The Tana'im of the Beraisos hold that wages are not owed until the completion of a job (therefore, it is as if he gives her money at the end);</p>
<p class="bas indent2"><span class="nm">1.</span>The Tana of our Mishnah holds that wages accrue from the start of the job until the end (it is considered like a debt, and a loan cannot be Mekadesh).</p>
<p class="bas indent1"><span class="nm">(f)</span><span class="cl">Question:</span> What forced Reish Lakish to say that the Tana holds that wages accrue from the start until the end, and he also gave her Kidushin money?</p>
<p class="bas indent1"><span class="nm">(g)</span><span class="cl">Answer (Rava) Question:</span> Why did the Mishnah say 'Al Menas that', and not 'in lieu of payment for'?</p>
<p class="bas indent2"><span class="nm">1.</span><span class="cl">Answer:</span> It is because the service is not the Kidushin money.</p>
<p class="bas subject"><span class="nm">3)</span>SATISFACTION WITH KIDUSHIN</p>
<p class="bas indent1"><span class="nm">(a)</span><span class="cl">(Mishnah):</span> If one said 'Al Menas that (my) father will want (that you be Mekudeshes to me)', if he wanted, she is Mekudeshes. If not, she is not Mekudeshes;</p>
<p class="bas indent2"><span class="nm">1.</span>If the father died, she is Mekudeshes. If the son dies, we counsel the father to say that he does not want (so she will not need to do Yibum).</p>
<p class="bas indent1"><span class="nm">(b)</span><span class="cl">(Gemara) Question:</span> What does it mean 'Al Menas that father will want'?</p>
<p class="bas indent2"><span class="nm">1.</span><span class="cl">Suggestion:</span> It means that he will say 'yes'.</p>
<p class="bas indent2"><span class="nm">2.</span><span class="cl">Rejection:</span> If the father died, she is Mekudeshes, even though he didn't say anything!</p>
<p class="bas bbbline">63b----------------------------------------63b</p>
<p class="bas indent1"><span class="nm">(c)</span><span class="cl">Answer #1:</span> Rather, it means that he will be silent.</p>
<p class="bas indent2"><span class="nm">1.</span><span class="cl">Objection (Seifa):</span> If the son dies, we counsel the father to say he does not want.</p>
<p class="bas indent3"><span class="nm">i.</span>How does this help? He was already silent!</p>
<p class="bas indent1"><span class="nm">(d)</span><span class="cl">Answer #2:</span> Rather, the entire Seifa (when either of them die) discusses when he explicitly said 'Al Menas that he will not protest.'</p>
<p class="bas indent1"><span class="nm">(e)</span><span class="cl">Objection:</span> Must we say that the Seifa discusses a different case than the Reisha?!</p>
<p class="bas indent1"><span class="nm">(f)</span><span class="cl">Answer (R. Yanai):</span> Indeed, it does!</p>
<p class="bas indent2"><span class="nm">1.</span><span class="cl">(Reish Lakish):</span> R. Yanai holds that when clauses of a Mishnah contradict each other, it is better to say that they discuss different cases, than to say that different Tana'im taught them.</p>
<p class="bas indent1"><span class="nm">(g)</span><span class="cl">Answer #3 (Rav Yosef bar Ami):</span> The Mishnah discusses one case. He said 'Al Menas that father will want';</p>
<p class="bas indent2"><span class="nm">1.</span>He means 'Al Menas that father will not protest within 30 days.'</p>
<p class="bas subject"><span class="nm">4)</span>DOUBTS ABOUT WHO IS THE HUSBAND</p>
<p class="bas indent1"><span class="nm">(a)</span><span class="cl">(Mishnah):</span> If Reuven does not remember to whom he was Mekadesh his daughter, and David came and said 'it was to me', he is believed;</p>
<p class="bas indent1"><span class="nm">(b)</span>If Moshe also claims that he was Mekadesh her, both men divorce her;</p>
<p class="bas indent2"><span class="nm">1.</span>If they agree, one can divorce her and the other can marry her.</p>
<p class="bas indent1"><span class="nm">(c)</span><span class="cl">(Gemara - Rav):</span> (In the Reisha) David is believed to divorce her (and permit her to everyone else), but he is not believed to marry her.</p>
<p class="bas indent2"><span class="nm">1.</span>He is believed to divorce her. (Had he not been Mekadesh her, he would not divorce her and make others think that she is permitted, for) one does not sin unless he hopes to benefit from it;</p>
<p class="bas indent2"><span class="nm">2.</span>He is not believed to marry her, lest his lust overcame him.</p>
<p class="bas indent1"><span class="nm">(d)</span><span class="cl">(Rav Asi):</span> He is believed even to marry her.</p>
<p class="bas indent2"><span class="nm">1.</span>Rav Asi admits that if a woman says 'I am Mekudeshes, I do not remember to whom', and Shimon says 'to me', he is not believed to marry her.</p>
<p class="bas indent1"><span class="nm">(e)</span><span class="cl">Question (against Rav - Mishnah):</span> If they agree, one can divorce her, and the other can marry her.</p>
<p class="bas indent1"><span class="nm">(f)</span><span class="cl">Answer (Rav):</span> That case is different. Since another man contradicts him, he would be afraid to marry her had he not truly been Mekadesh her.</p>
<p class="bas indent1"><span class="nm">(g)</span><span class="cl">Support (for Rav Asi - Beraisa):</span> If Reuven does not remember to whom he was Mekadesh his daughter, and David says 'it was to me', he is believed even to marry her.</p>
<p class="bas indent2"><span class="nm">1.</span>If after he marries her, Moshe says 'she was Mekudeshes to me', he is not believed to forbid her to David.</p>
<p class="bas indent2"><span class="nm">2.</span>If a woman does not remember to whom she was Mekadesh herself; and David says 'it was to me', he is not believed to marry her, lest she agree even though he lies (she fears lest the Mekadesh never come, and she will never be able to remarry).</p>
<p class="bas subject"><span class="nm">5)</span>ESTABLISHING AN ISUR</p>
<p class="bas indent1"><span class="nm">(a)</span><span class="cl">Question:</span> If a man says that he was Mekadesh his daughter, do we kill one who has Bi'ah with her?</p>
<p class="bas indent1"><span class="nm">(b)</span><span class="cl">Answer #1 (Rav):</span> No.</p>
<p class="bas indent1"><span class="nm">(c)</span><span class="cl">Answer #2 (Rav Asi):</span> Yes.</p>
<p class="bas indent2"><span class="nm">1.</span>Rav holds that the Torah believes the father to forbid her, but not to kill people due to this;</p>
<p class="bas indent2"><span class="nm">2.</span>Rav Asi says that the Torah totally believes the father.</p>
<p class="bas indent1"><span class="nm">(d)</span><span class="cl">(Rav Asi):</span> I admit that we do not kill based on her admission that she was Mekadesh herself.</p>
<p class="bas indent1"><span class="nm">(e)</span><span class="cl">Rav Asi:</span> Seemingly, I contradict myself!</p>
<p class="bas indent2"><span class="nm">1.</span>When her father was Mekadesh her (but forgot to whom), a man is believed to marry her, and a father is believed totally that she is Mekudeshes, even to kill people;</p>
<p class="bas indent2"><span class="nm">2.</span>When she was Mekadesh herself (but forgot to whom), a man is not believed to marry her. All the more so, she should be totally believed that she is Mekudeshes, even to kill people!</p>
<p class="bas indent1"><span class="nm">(f)</span><span class="cl">Answer (Rav Asi):</span> This is not difficult. The Torah believed only the father, not her. (When she says that she is Mekudeshes, her admission forbids to other men.)</p>
<p class="bas indent1"><span class="nm">(g)</span><span class="cl">(Rav Chisda):</span> We do not kill based on what the father or she herself says.</p>
<p class="bas indent1"><span class="nm">(h)</span>This is like Rav Chisda taught elsewhere:</p>
<p class="bas indent2"><span class="nm">1.</span><span class="cl">(Rav Chisda):</span> If a man says that his son is over nine years old, or that his daughter is over three (so the child's Bi'ah is considered Bi'ah), he is believed for Korbanos (e.g. to obligate an adult who had Bi'ah with the child b'Shogeg, if this was forbidden due to Ervah or Nidah), but not to lash or kill the adult.</p>
<p class="bas indent2"><span class="nm">2.</span><span class="cl">Support (Beraisa):</span> If a man said 'my son (or daughter) is Bar (or Bas) Mitzvah', he is believed for vows (that the child makes), Cherem, Hekdesh, and Erchin (they take effect);</p>
<p class="bas indent3"><span class="nm">i.</span>He is not believed for lashes or execution if the child transgressed.</p>
