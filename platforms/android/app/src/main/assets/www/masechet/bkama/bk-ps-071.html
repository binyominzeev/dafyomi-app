<p class="bas subject"><span class="nm">1)</span>DOUBLE LIABILITY</p>
<p class="bas indent1"><span class="nm">(a)</span><span class="cl">(Mishnah):</span> If he stole and slaughtered on Yom Kipur...</p>
<p class="bas indent1"><span class="nm">(b)</span><span class="cl">Question:</span> Why does he pay? Granted, he is not liable to die, but he is lashed, and one does not get lashes and pay!</p>
<p class="bas indent1"><span class="nm">(c)</span><span class="cl">Answer #1:</span> The Mishnah is like R. Meir, who says that one is lashed and pays.</p>
<p class="bas indent1"><span class="nm">(d)</span><span class="cl">Question:</span> If the Mishnah is like R. Meir, he should pay even if he slaughtered on Shabbos!</p>
<p class="bas indent2"><span class="nm">1.</span><span class="cl">Suggestion:</span> Perhaps R. Meir says that one is lashed and pays, but one liable to die does not pay.</p>
<p class="bas indent2"><span class="nm">2.</span><span class="cl">Rejection (Beraisa - R. Meir):</span> A thief pays four and five even for stealing and slaughtering on Shabbos, to idolatry, or an animal sentenced to be stoned;</p>
<p class="bas indent2"><span class="nm">3.</span>Chachamim exempt.</p>
<p class="bas indent1"><span class="nm">(e)</span><span class="cl">Answer:</span> Indeed, R. Meir says that one is lashed and pays, but one liable to die does not pay;</p>
<p class="bas indent2"><span class="nm">1.</span>R. Yochanan explained that the Beraisa discusses when the thief made a Shali'ach to slaughter for him. (We do not say that our Mishnah discusses a thief who made a Shali'ach to slaughter, for if so he would be liable even on Shabbos. However, the Rif says that our Mishnah is when the thief made a Shali'ach. It seems that he had a different text.)</p>
<p class="bas indent1"><span class="nm">(f)</span><span class="cl">Question:</span> Must the thief pay for the transgression of his Shali'ach?! (Such a Shelichus is invalid!)</p>
<p class="bas indent1"><span class="nm">(g)</span><span class="cl">Answer #1 (Rava):</span> This is an exception, for "and he will slaughter or sell it" equates slaughter and selling. Just like he is liable for selling it, which involves another person, also for slaughtering it through another person.</p>
<p class="bas indent1"><span class="nm">(h)</span><span class="cl">Answer #2 (Tana d'Vei R. Yishmael):</span> "Or" includes that he is liable through (slaughter by) a Shali'ach.</p>
<p class="bas indent1"><span class="nm">(i)</span><span class="cl">Answer #3 (Tana d'Vei Chizkiyah):</span> "Tachas (in place of)" includes that he is liable through a Shali'ach.</p>
<p class="bas indent1"><span class="nm">(j)</span><span class="cl">Question (Mar Zutra):</span> Do we ever find that Reuven would be exempt for doing something, and if his Shali'ach does it, Reuven is liable?!</p>
<p class="bas indent1"><span class="nm">(k)</span><span class="cl">Answer (Rav Ashi):</span> If the thief would slaughter himself, really he is liable;</p>
<p class="bas indent2"><span class="nm">1.</span>He need not pay because he is Chayav Misah.</p>
<p class="bas indent1"><span class="nm">(l)</span><span class="cl">Question:</span> If the thief made a Shali'ach to slaughter for him, why do Chachamim exempt the thief?</p>
<p class="bas indent1"><span class="nm">(m)</span><span class="cl">Answer:</span> Chachamim hold like R. Shimon, that slaughter that does not permit the meat is not considered slaughter.</p>
<p class="bas subject"><span class="nm">2)</span>SLAUGHTER ON SHABBOS</p>
<p class="bas indent1"><span class="nm">(a)</span><span class="cl">Question:</span> This explains only slaughter for idolatry or of a sentenced ox. However, slaughter on Shabbos permits the meat!</p>
<p class="bas indent2"><span class="nm">1.</span><span class="cl">(Mishnah):</span> If one slaughters on Shabbos or Yom Kipur, even though he is Chayav Misah, the slaughter is valid.</p>
<p class="bas indent1"><span class="nm">(b)</span><span class="cl">Answer:</span> Our Tana holds like R. Yochanan ha'Sandlar.</p>
<p class="bas indent2"><span class="nm">1.</span><span class="cl">(Mishnah - R. Meir):</span> If one cooks on Shabbos, if it was b'Shogeg, he may eat it (even on Shabbos). If he was Mezid, he may not eat it (on Shabbos);</p>
<p class="bas indent2"><span class="nm">2.</span>R. Yehudah says, if he was Shogeg, he may eat it after Shabbos. If he was Mezid, he may never eat it;</p>
<p class="bas indent2"><span class="nm">3.</span>R. Yochanan ha'Sandlar says, if he was Shogeg, others may eat it after Shabbos. If he was Mezid, even others may never eat it.</p>
<p class="bas indent1"><span class="nm">(c)</span><span class="cl">Question:</span> What is R. Yochanan ha'Sandlar's reason?</p>
<p class="bas indent1"><span class="nm">(d)</span><span class="cl">Answer (R. Chiya):</span> "... Shabbos is Kodesh to you" - just like one may not eat Kodesh, also what is made on Shabbos;</p>
<p class="bas indent2"><span class="nm">1.</span><span class="cl">Suggestion:</span> Perhaps what is made on Shabbos is Asur b'Hana'ah (forbidden to benefit from it), just like Kodesh!</p>
<p class="bas indent2"><span class="nm">2.</span><span class="cl">Rejection:</span> "To you" - you may benefit from it.</p>
<p class="bas indent2"><span class="nm">3.</span><span class="cl">Suggestion:</span> Perhaps even what is made on Shabbos b'Shogeg is Asur b'Hana'ah!</p>
<p class="bas indent2"><span class="nm">4.</span><span class="cl">Rejection:</span> "Those who profane it will die" applies only to Mezid sinners.</p>
<p class="bas indent1"><span class="nm">(e)</span>R. Acha and Ravina argued about whether R. Yochanan ha'Sandlar forbids what is made on Shabbos mid'Oraisa or mid'Rabanan.</p>
<p class="bas indent2"><span class="nm">1.</span>One says that he forbids mid'Oraisa, like we expounded!</p>
<p class="bas indent2"><span class="nm">2.</span>The other opinion expounds "it is Kodesh", but what is made on Shabbos is not Kodesh.</p>
<p class="bas indent1"><span class="nm">(f)</span>According to the opinion that forbids mid'Oraisa, we answered why Chachamim exempt the thief.</p>
<p class="bas bbbline">71b----------------------------------------71b</p>
<p class="bas indent1"><span class="nm">(g)</span><span class="cl">Question:</span> According to the opinion that forbids mid'Rabanan, why do Chachamim exempt him?</p>
<p class="bas indent1"><span class="nm">(h)</span><span class="cl">Answer:</span> Indeed, they exempt him only in the other cases.</p>
<p class="bas subject"><span class="nm">3)</span>THE OTHER CASES</p>
<p class="bas indent1"><span class="nm">(a)</span><span class="cl">Question:</span> Why does R. Meir obligate him for slaughter to idolatry? Once he starts slaughtering, the animal is Asur b'Hana'ah, and it no longer belongs to the original owner!</p>
<p class="bas indent1"><span class="nm">(b)</span><span class="cl">Answer (Rava):</span> The case is, he said that he serves the idolatry only through conclusion of the slaughter.</p>
<p class="bas indent1"><span class="nm">(c)</span><span class="cl">Question:</span> Why does R. Meir obligate for slaughter of a sentenced animal? It is Asur b'Hana'ah. It does not belong to the original owner!</p>
<p class="bas indent1"><span class="nm">(d)</span><span class="cl">Answer (Rava):</span> The case is, Levi deposited his ox with a Shomer (Shimon). While it was with Shimon, it gored and was sentenced. Reuven slaughtered it. R. Meir holds like R. Yakov and like R. Shimon.</p>
<p class="bas indent2"><span class="nm">1.</span>R. Yakov says, even if a Shomer returns an animal after it was sentenced, it is considered returned;</p>
<p class="bas indent2"><span class="nm">2.</span>R. Shimon obligates one who damages something that is worth money to someone (even if it is worthless to all others. Here, the ox has value only to Shimon, who can exempt himself by returning it.)</p>
<p class="bas indent3"><span class="nm">i.</span><span class="cl">(Mishnah - R. Shimon):</span> If one damages a Korban with Achrayus (one must bring a replacement if that animal is not brought), he is liable.</p>
<p class="bas indent1"><span class="nm">(e)</span><span class="cl">Question (Rav Zvid of Nehardai):</span> How can R. Yochanan say that our Mishnah (which obligates for slaughter on Yom Kipur) is only like R. Meir (who obligates lashes and money), but unlike R. Shimon?</p>
<p class="bas indent2"><span class="nm">1.</span><span class="cl">(Reisha):</span> R. Shimon exempts in these two cases. 2.  Inference: He agrees in all other cases!</p>
<p class="bas indent1"><span class="nm">(f)</span><span class="cl">Answer (Rav Kahana):</span> No, we may infer only that he agrees about slaughter for dogs or medicinal needs, which were also taught in the last clause.</p>
<p class="bas subject"><span class="nm">4)</span>A HALF-FINE</p>
<p class="bas indent1"><span class="nm">(a)</span><span class="cl">(Mishnah):</span> If he stole from his father and slaughtered or sold...</p>
<p class="bas indent1"><span class="nm">(b)</span><span class="cl">Question (Rava):</span> If Reuven stole and slaughtered an ox of two partners, then he admitted to one of them (which exempts him from paying a fine to that partner), what is the law?</p>
<p class="bas indent2"><span class="nm">1.</span>The Torah said "five cattle in place of the ox", not five half-cattle;</p>
<p class="bas indent2"><span class="nm">2.</span>Or, one pays "five cattle", and even five half- cattle.</p>
<p class="bas indent1"><span class="nm">(c)</span><span class="cl">Answer #1 (Rav Nachman):</span> There is no payment of five half-cattle.</p>
<p class="bas indent1"><span class="nm">(d)</span><span class="cl">Question (Mishnah):</span> If he stole from his father and slaughtered or sold, then his father died, he pays four and five.</p>
<p class="bas indent2"><span class="nm">1.</span>When the father dies, he inherits part, and is exempt for his part, yet he pays four and five for the parts of his brothers!</p>
<p class="bas indent1"><span class="nm">(e)</span><span class="cl">Answer:</span> The case is, Beis Din ruled that he is liable, and then his father died.</p>
<p class="bas indent1"><span class="nm">(f)</span><span class="cl">Inference:</span> Had his father died before this, he would be exempt.</p>
<p class="bas indent1"><span class="nm">(g)</span><span class="cl">Question:</span> If so, why does the Seifa (74b) exempt (from four and five) for slaughter after his father died? It should teach that even when he slaughtered in his father's life, if his father died before the trial, he is exempt!</p>
<p class="bas indent1"><span class="nm">(h)</span><span class="cl">Answer:</span> Indeed, he is exempt then. The Tana preferred to teach about slaughtering after the father died for parallel structure.</p>
<p class="bas indent1"><span class="nm">(i)</span><span class="cl">Answer #2 (retraction - Rav Nachman):</span> He pays five half-cattle.</p>
<p class="bas indent2"><span class="nm">1.</span>Last night I answered incorrectly, for I did not investigate well enough (Rashi; Tosfos - I was fasting).</p>
