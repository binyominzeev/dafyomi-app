<div class="subject"><span class="nm">1)</span><p>THE FINE FOR SELLING AN ANIMAL TO A NOCHRI</p></div>
<div class="indent1"><span class="nm">(a)</span><p><span class="cl">Rejection:</span> No, they discuss giving a fetus.</p></div>
<div class="indent1"><span class="nm">(b)</span><p><span class="cl">Support:</span> It says "he is fined 10 times b'Damav." (R. Gershom - this is masculine. It must discuss a fetus. Maharsha - it is unreasonable to fine 10 times for giving a female for its offspring. Rashi's text says "he gives its full value to a Kohen." There is no reason to give the mother to a Kohen.)</p></div>
<div class="indent1"><span class="nm">(c)</span><p><span class="cl">Version #1:</span> This supports Reish Lakish.</p></div>
<div class="indent2"><span class="nm">1.</span><p><span class="cl">(Reish Lakish):</span> If one sold a large animal to a Nochri, he is fined. He must buy it back for up to 10 times its value.</p></div>
<div class="indent1"><span class="nm">(d)</span><p><span class="cl">Question:</span> Is this precise? (Must he pay even more? Alternatively - is this an exaggeration?)</p></div>
<div class="indent1"><span class="nm">(e)</span><p><span class="cl">Answer:</span> R. Yehoshua ben Levi taught that if one sold a slave to a Nochri, he is fined. He must buy it back for up to 100 times its value. (Rashi - each of these is precise. If not, both of them would have taught the same number. Shitah Mekubetzes - surely, the same fine applies to an animal. Ten is not precise.)</p></div>
<div class="indent1"><span class="nm">(f)</span><p><span class="cl">Rejection:</span> Perhaps the fine for an animal is (even) smaller. It is not like selling a slave, for that prevents the slave from being able to keep Mitzvos.</p></div>
<div class="indent1"><span class="nm">(g)</span><p><span class="cl">Version #2 - (Reish Lakish):</span> If one sold a large animal to a Nochri, he is fined. He must buy it back for up to 100 times its value.</p></div>
<div class="indent1"><span class="nm">(h)</span><p><span class="cl">Question (Beraisa):</span> If he gave to a Nochri b'Kabalah, even though this is forbidden, he is fined 10 times its value.</p></div>
<div class="indent1"><span class="nm">(i)</span><p><span class="cl">Answer:</span> The fine is bigger for an absolute sale than for giving b'Kabalah.</p></div>
<div class="indent1"><span class="nm">(j)</span><p><span class="cl">Question:</span> Reish Lakish says 100. Is this precise?</p></div>
<div class="indent1"><span class="nm">(k)</span><p><span class="cl">Answer:</span> R. Yehoshua ben Levi taught that if one sold a slave to a Nochri, he is fined. He must buy it back for up to 10 times its value. (Rashi - surely, the fine for an animal is not greater than for a slave; 100 is an exaggeration; Shitah Mekubetzes - just like 10 for a slave is not precise (surely, it is no less than for an animal), 100 is not precise (one must pay more).)</p></div>
<div class="indent1"><span class="nm">(l)</span><p><span class="cl">Rejection #1:</span> Perhaps the fine for an animal is larger, because he gets to keep the animal.</p></div>
<div class="indent1"><span class="nm">(m)</span><p><span class="cl">Rejection of rejection:</span> This justifies paying only one more times the value, but not 90 times more!</p></div>
<div class="indent1"><span class="nm">(n)</span><p><span class="cl">Rejection #2:</span> It is unusual to sell a slave to Nochrim, Chachamim did not fine (so much) in unusual cases.</p></div>
<div class="subject"><span class="nm">2)</span><p>PARTIAL OWNERSHIP OF A NOCHRI</p></div>
<div class="indent1"><span class="nm">(a)</span><p><span class="cl">(Beraisa - Chachamim):</span> Whenever a Nochri has a share...</p></div>
<div class="indent1"><span class="nm">(b)</span><p><span class="cl">(R. Yochanan):</span> Both Tana'im expound the same verse - "Chol Bechor."</p></div>
<div class="indent1"><span class="nm">(c)</span><p><span class="cl">Possibility #1:</span> Chachamim hold that "Bechor" connotes even a partial Bechor (i.e. part lacks Kedushas Bechor, because it is owned by a Nochri). "Chol" requires it to be a full Bechor;</p></div>
<div class="indent2"><span class="nm">1.</span><p>R. Yehudah holds that "Bechor" connotes a full Bechor. "Chol" includes even a partial Bechor.</p></div>
<div class="indent1"><span class="nm">(d)</span><p><span class="cl">Possibility #2:</span> All agree that "Bechor" connotes that the majority has Kedushas Bechor:</p></div>
<div class="indent2"><span class="nm">1.</span><p>Chachamim hold that "Chol" requires it to be a full Bechor;</p></div>
<div class="indent2"><span class="nm">2.</span><p>R. Yehudah holds that "Chol" includes even a minority Bechor.</p></div>
<div class="indent1"><span class="nm">(e)</span><p><span class="cl">Question:</span> (According to Chachamim,) how much must a Nochri own to exempt it?</p></div>
<div class="indent1"><span class="nm">(f)</span><p><span class="cl">Answer #1 (Rav Huna):</span> Even if he owns an ear it is exempt.</p></div>
<div class="indent1"><span class="nm">(g)</span><p><span class="cl">Question (Rav Nachman):</span> Even if the ear would be cut off and given to the Nochri, the remainder would (be blemished, but still) have Kedushas Bechor! (It must be given to a Kohen. One may not work with it, shear it, or sell it in the market.)</p></div>
<div class="indent1"><span class="nm">(h)</span><p><span class="cl">Answer #2 (Rav Chisda):</span> If removal of the Nochri's share would make it Nevelah, it is exempt.</p></div>
<div class="indent1"><span class="nm">(i)</span><p><span class="cl">Answer #3 (Rava):</span> If removal of the Nochri's share would make it Treifah, it is exempt.</p></div>
<div class="indent1"><span class="nm">(j)</span><p><span class="cl">Question:</span> What do Rava and Rav Chisda argue about?</p></div>
<div class="indent1"><span class="nm">(k)</span><p><span class="cl">Answer:</span> They argue about whether or not a Treifah can live (R. Gershom - for 12 months):</p></div>
<div class="indent2"><span class="nm">1.</span><p>Rava holds that it cannot;</p></div>
<div class="indent2"><span class="nm">2.</span><p>Rav Chisda holds that it can. Therefore, the Nochri's share is not essential unless its removal would make it Nevelah.</p></div>
<div class="indent1"><span class="nm">(l)</span><p><span class="cl">Rabanan:</span> Rav Chisda and Rava do not argue with Rav Huna. They say how much a Nochri must own of the mother to exempt. Rav Huna says how much he must own of the fetus to exempt.</p></div>
<div class="indent1"><span class="nm">(m)</span><p><span class="cl">Objection (Rav Papa):</span> Presumably, you say that any (Nochri) ownership in the fetus exempts, because this is not "Kol Bechor";</p></div>
<div class="indent2"><span class="nm">1.</span><p>If so, any ownership also in the mother should exempt, because this is not "v'Chol Miknecha Tizachar"!</p></div>
<div class="indent2"><span class="nm">2.</span><p>Rather, there is no distinction between the mother and the fetus.</p></div>
<div class="indent1"><span class="nm">(n)</span><p><span class="cl">Question (against all three answers - Mar bar Rav Ashi):</span> Why is this different than Nefalim (non-viable offspring)? They get Kedushas Bechor, even though they have no life at all!</p></div>
<div class="indent2"><span class="nm">1.</span><p>"(Kedushas Bechor applies to) Peter <i>Sheger</i> Behemah." This is a fetus that was born prematurely (alternatively - a miscarriage).</p></div>
<div class="indent1"><span class="nm">(o)</span><p><span class="cl">Answer:</span> There, the entire fetus is proper for Kedushas Bechor. This is "bi'Vehemah Kol Bechor." Here, there is a mixture of Chulin (the Nochri's share). The verse does not apply.</p></div>
<div class="subject"><span class="nm">3)</span><p>IS A DEVIATION A MUM?</p></div>
<div class="indent1"><span class="nm">(a)</span><p><span class="cl">R. Asi (to R. Elazar):</span> (When you were not in the Beis Medrash,) R. Yochanan taught a law and explained a Mishnah.</p></div>
<div class="bbbline">3b----------------------------------------3b</p></div>
<div class="indent1"><span class="nm">(b)</span><p><span class="cl">(R. Yochanan):</span> If removal of the Nochri's share would make even a minor Mum (blemish), it is exempt.</p></div>
<div class="indent1"><span class="nm">(c)</span><p><span class="cl">(Mishnah):</span> If a sheep gave birth to a goat, or vice-versa, it is (a Nidmeh, i.e. the child does not resemble the mother. It is) exempt from Bechorah;</p></div>
<div class="indent2"><span class="nm">1.</span><p>If the child resembles its mother in some ways, it has Kedushas Bechor;</p></div>
<div class="indent2"><span class="nm">2.</span><p><span class="cl">(R. Yochanan):</span> (Since it primarily resembles another species,) this is a Kavu'a (permanent) Mum. It may be slaughtered (outside the Mikdash, like Chulin).</p></div>
<div class="indent1"><span class="nm">(d)</span><p><span class="cl">Question:</span> Granted, the first teaching is a Chidush. It is like Rav Huna, and unlike Rav Chisda and Rava. (Ramban - some say that it is not exactly like Rav Huna, who exempts even if removal of the Nochri's share would not make any Mum.)</p></div>
<div class="indent2"><span class="nm">1.</span><p>However, it is no Chidush to say that a partial Nidmeh is a Mum Kavu'a. A Mishnah teaches that any deviation is a Mum!</p></div>
<div class="indent2"><span class="nm">2.</span><p><span class="cl">(Mishnah):</span> If its mouth resembles a swine's mouth, this is a Mum.</p></div>
<div class="indent2"><span class="nm">3.</span><p><span class="cl">Suggestion:</span> Perhaps that is a Mum because it resembles something that has no Kedushas Bechor, but if it resembles a sheep or goat (even though this is unlike its mother), this is not a Mum!</p></div>
<div class="indent2"><span class="nm">4.</span><p><span class="cl">Rejection:</span> A Mishnah (according to a Beraisa that explains it) refutes this!</p></div>
<div class="indent3"><span class="nm">i.</span><p><span class="cl">(Mishnah):</span> If one eye was big or one eye was small, this is a Mum.</p></div>
<div class="indent3"><span class="nm">ii.</span><p><span class="cl">(Beraisa):</span> This refers to an eye (of a Seh) as big as that of a calf or as small as that of a goose.</p></div>
<div class="indent3"><span class="nm">iii.</span><p>Granted, geese have no Kedushas Bechor, but calves do. Surely, an eye as big as a calf's is a Mum because it is a deviation!</p></div>
<div class="indent1"><span class="nm">(e)</span><p><span class="cl">Answer:</span> No, the Mishnah refers to the Mum of Sharu'a (one limb of a pair is bigger than its counterpart).</p></div>
<div class="indent1"><span class="nm">(f)</span><p><span class="cl">Support (Mishnah):</span> These Mumim (of animals, listed in the sixth Perek), whether Over (temporary) or Kavu'a, disqualify a Kohen from Avodah. In addition, if a Kohen's eyes are too big or too small, he is Pasul.</p></div>
<div class="indent2"><span class="nm">1.</span><p>Big or small eyes disqualifies a Kohen, for it says "Ish Ish mi'Zera Aharon." A Kohen must be similar to other descendants of Aharon (like regular people);</p></div>
<div class="indent2"><span class="nm">2.</span><p>Big or small eyes do not disqualify an animal.</p></div>
<div class="indent2"><span class="nm">3.</span><p><span class="cl">Question:</span> Why is an animal Pasul if it has one big or one small eye?</p></div>
<div class="indent3"><span class="nm">i.</span><p>If any deviation is a Mum, even two big or small eyes should disqualify!</p></div>
<div class="indent2"><span class="nm">4.</span><p><span class="cl">Answer:</span> This is (the Mum called) "Sharu'a."</p></div>
<div class="indent1"><span class="nm">(g)</span><p><span class="cl">Rejection (of the answer and the support) :</span> Really, the deviation disqualifies;</p></div>
<div class="indent2"><span class="nm">1.</span><p>Two big or small eyes does not disqualify, because it is due to the animal being healthy or weak!</p></div>
<div class="indent2"><span class="nm">2.</span><p>We cannot attribute one big or small eye to being healthy or weak. If so, both should be the same!</p></div>
<div class="subject"><span class="nm">4)</span><p>EXEMPTING FROM BECHORAH</p></div>
<div class="indent1"><span class="nm">(a)</span><p>A case occurred in which a Nochri gave an animal to his sister, who was a convert, to fatten it.</p></div>
<div class="indent1"><span class="nm">(b)</span><p><span class="cl">(Rava):</span> No one is concerned for R. Yehudah's opinion that partnership of a Nochri does not exempt from Bechorah.</p></div>
<div class="indent1"><span class="nm">(c)</span><p>Rav Mari bar Rachel had a flock. He used to be Makneh (transfer ownership of) the ears to a Nochri, yet he would forbid working (with the Bechoros) and would give them to Kohanim. His flock died out.</p></div>
<div class="indent1"><span class="nm">(d)</span><p><span class="cl">Question:</span> Since he would forbid working with them and give them to Kohanim, why did he give the ears to a Nochri?</p></div>
<div class="indent1"><span class="nm">(e)</span><p><span class="cl">Answer:</span> He was concerned for Takalah (lest someone slaughter it by mistake).</p></div>
<div class="indent1"><span class="nm">(f)</span><p><span class="cl">Question:</span> Why did his flock die out?</p></div>
<div class="indent1"><span class="nm">(g)</span><p><span class="cl">Answer #1:</span> It was a punishment for uprooting Kedushas Bechor.</p></div>
<div class="indent2"><span class="nm">1.</span><p><span class="cl">Question:</span> Rav Yehudah permits blemishing a Bechor before it leaves the womb (even though this uproots the Kedushah)!</p></div>
<div class="indent2"><span class="nm">2.</span><p><span class="cl">Answer:</span> This disqualifies it from Hakravah, but the Mitzvah to give it to a Kohen remains. Rav Mari uprooted the entire Mitzvah.</p></div>
<div class="indent1"><span class="nm">(h)</span><p><span class="cl">Answer #2:</span> Rav Mari caused a Takalah. He knew how to be Makneh to a Nochri, but onlookers, who did not know the proper way, would be Makneh in an invalid way (and mistakenly think that the Bechor is not Kodesh. Rashi - they thought that he was Makneh verbally. Really, the Nochri paid money; Tosfos - he was Makneh the mother for the sake of acquiring the fetus' ear. Others would be Makneh the ear of the fetus. This does not take effect, for it is Lo Ba l'Olam (not yet in the world). Shitah Mekubetzes - he told the Nochri to do Meshichah on a pregnant mother to acquire the fetus' ear. People would do this before the mother was pregnant. R. Gershom - one of his adult children would Mezakeh (acquire) on behalf of the Nochri. Others would be Mezakeh through a minor.)</p></div>
