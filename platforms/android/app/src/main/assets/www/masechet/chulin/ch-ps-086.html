<div class="subject"><span class="nm">1)</span><p>EXEMPTIONS FROM KISUY</p></div>
<div class="indent1"><span class="nm">(a)</span><p><span class="cl">Question:</span> According to Version #2, why didn't he say to make it Terefah and then slaughter it?</p></div>
<div class="indent2"><span class="nm">1.</span><p><span class="cl">Suggestion:</span> Rebbi holds that invalid Shechitah is considered Shechitah.</p></div>
<div class="indent2"><span class="nm">2.</span><p><span class="cl">Rejection:</span> R. Chiya bar Aba taught that regarding Kisuy ha'Dam, Rebbi does not consider invalid Shechitah to be Shechitah, so the Mishnah attributes this opinion to Chachamim.</p></div>
<div class="indent1"><span class="nm">(b)</span><p><span class="cl">Answer:</span> Rebbi taught a bigger Chidush;</p></div>
<div class="indent2"><span class="nm">1.</span><p>Had he said to make it Terefah, one might have thought that a slaughtered Terefah is exempt from Kisuy, for Pasul Shechitah is not slaughter, but one must cover Dam Nechirah (because the Torah does not require Shechitah of birds, Nechirah suffices);</p></div>
<div class="indent2"><span class="nm">2.</span><p>Rebbi teaches that this is not so. It says "like I commanded you."</p></div>
<div class="subject"><span class="nm">2)</span><p>THE MERIT OF TZADIKIM</p></div>
<div class="indent1"><span class="nm">(a)</span><p><span class="cl">Question:</span> How could a moth fall in R. Chiya's flax?!</p></div>
<div class="indent2"><span class="nm">1.</span><p><span class="cl">(Ravin bar Aba):</span> Ominous signs plagued Eretz Yisrael after the Churban - shooting stars, earthquakes, raging winds, thunder, spoiling of wine, flax being stricken;</p></div>
<div class="indent2"><span class="nm">2.</span><p>These ended after Tzadikim came to Eretz Yisrael;</p></div>
<div class="indent2"><span class="nm">3.</span><p>Rabanan attributed this to R. Chiya and his sons.</p></div>
<div class="indent1"><span class="nm">(b)</span><p><span class="cl">Answer:</span> Their merit helps the rest of the world, but not themselves.</p></div>
<div class="indent2"><span class="nm">1.</span><p><span class="cl">(Rav Yehudah):</span> Every day, a voice from Heaven announces that the entire world is fed in the merit of R. Chanina ben Dosa, and (some explain - because) R. Chanina subsists on one Kav of dates for an entire week!</p></div>
<div class="subject"><span class="nm">3)</span><p>SHECHITAH BY A DEAF-MUTE, LUNATIC OR MINOR</p></div>
<div class="indent1"><span class="nm">(a)</span><p><span class="cl">(Mishnah):</span> If a Cheresh, Shoteh or Katan slaughtered while others looked on, the onlookers must cover the blood;</p></div>
<div class="indent2"><span class="nm">1.</span><p>If he slaughtered unsupervised, Kisuy need not be done.</p></div>
<div class="indent1"><span class="nm">(b)</span><p>Similarly, if a Cheresh, Shoteh or Katan slaughtered while others looked on, the mother or child of the animal may not be slaughtered that same day;</p></div>
<div class="indent1"><span class="nm">(c)</span><p>If he slaughtered unsupervised;</p></div>
<div class="indent2"><span class="nm">1.</span><p>R. Meir permits slaughtering the mother or child the same day. Chachamim forbid this;</p></div>
<div class="indent2"><span class="nm">2.</span><p>Chachamim agree that if one slaughtered the mother or child, he is not lashed.</p></div>
<div class="indent1"><span class="nm">(d)</span><p><span class="cl">(Gemara) Question:</span> Why do Chachamim argue only in the Seifa?</p></div>
<div class="indent1"><span class="nm">(e)</span><p><span class="cl">Answer #1:</span> In the Reisha, if we obligate people to cover the blood, perhaps people will think that the Shechitah was valid, and they will come to eat the meat.</p></div>
<div class="indent2"><span class="nm">1.</span><p><span class="cl">Question:</span> The same concern applies in the Seifa. Since one may not slaughter the mother or child on the same day, people will think that the first Shechitah was valid!</p></div>
<div class="indent2"><span class="nm">2.</span><p><span class="cl">Answer:</span> No. People will think that the owner of the mother or child did not want to eat meat that day.</p></div>
<div class="indent2"><span class="nm">3.</span><p><span class="cl">Question:</span> Likewise, we could obligate onlookers to cover the blood, and observers will think that the person just wants to clean the courtyard!</p></div>
<div class="indent2"><span class="nm">4.</span><p><span class="cl">Answer #1:</span> If the blood is in the wasteheap, people will know it is being covered for the Mitzvah. (They will assume that the Shechitah was valid.)</p></div>
<div class="indent2"><span class="nm">5.</span><p><span class="cl">Answer #2:</span> If one asks whether he should cover the blood (and is told 'Yes'), he will think that the Shechitah was valid!</p></div>
<div class="indent2"><span class="nm">6.</span><p><span class="cl">Objection:</span> The same applies to Oso v'Es Beno. One who asks whether he may slaughter the mother or child will think that the first Shechitah was valid!</p></div>
<div class="indent1"><span class="nm">(f)</span><p><span class="cl">Answer #2:</span> Indeed, Chachamim argue also in the Reisha. They allowed R. Meir to teach both cases before they argued with on him.</p></div>
<div class="indent1"><span class="nm">(g)</span><p><span class="cl">Question:</span> Granted, Chachamim are stringent in both cases (because they are unsure);</p></div>
<div class="indent2"><span class="nm">1.</span><p>What is R. Meir's reason?</p></div>
<div class="indent1"><span class="nm">(h)</span><p><span class="cl">Answer (R. Yakov):</span> R. Meir considers the Shechitah of a Cheresh, Shoteh or Katan to be Nevelah.</p></div>
<div class="indent2"><span class="nm">1.</span><p><span class="cl">Question:</span> What is the reason?</p></div>
<div class="indent2"><span class="nm">2.</span><p><span class="cl">Answer:</span> They usually slaughter improperly.</p></div>
<div class="indent1"><span class="nm">(i)</span><p><span class="cl">Question (Rav Papa):</span> Why must we say that they ruin most Shechitos? Even if they ruin a minority, R. Meir is concerned for a minority!</p></div>
<div class="indent2"><span class="nm">1.</span><p>We would join the minority of Pasul Shechitos to the Chazakah that the animal is forbidden (Rashi - due to Ever Min ha'Chai; Tosfos - it was not slaughtered. Perhaps it still has not had proper Shechitah), and we can no longer rely on the majority of valid Shechitos!</p></div>
<div class="indent2"><span class="nm">2.</span><p><span class="cl">(Mishnah - R. Meir):</span> If a child is next to a dough, holding a piece of dough, the (big) dough is Tahor;</p></div>
<div class="indent3"><span class="nm">i.</span><p>Chachamim say, it is Tamei, because most young children play and touch (Rashi - in the wasteheap. They become Teme'im from Sheratzim. Surely, the child touched the dough to take a piece. Tosfos - all children are (Muchzakim to be) Teme'im, for Nidos hug them. Most play with dough. He probably touched it himself. We do not assumes that he is from the minority who do not touch, and a Tahor person gave a piece to him.)</p></div>
<div class="indent2"><span class="nm">3.</span><p><span class="cl">Question:</span> What is R. Meir's reason?</p></div>
<div class="indent2"><span class="nm">4.</span><p><span class="cl">Answer:</span> Most children touch. A minority do not. The dough has Chezkas Taharah;</p></div>
<div class="bbbline">86b----------------------------------------86b</p></div>
<div class="indent3"><span class="nm">i.</span><p>We combine the minority of children who don't touch with the Chazakah. This weakens the majority who touch. (We are left with a Safek. This is a case of Ein Da'as Lish'ol (we cannot ask the child what happened, for he is too young). It is Tahor even in Reshus ha'Rabim.)</p></div>
<div class="indent1"><span class="nm">(j)</span><p><span class="cl">Answer:</span> R. Meir is concerned for a minority regarding Tum'ah, but he never said this to permit an Isur!</p></div>
<div class="indent1"><span class="nm">(k)</span><p>Rebbi ruled like R. Meir. On another occasion, he ruled like Chachamim.</p></div>
<div class="indent1"><span class="nm">(l)</span><p><span class="cl">Question:</span> Which of these rulings came last (was his final ruling)?</p></div>
<div class="indent1"><span class="nm">(m)</span><p><span class="cl">Answer:</span> R. Elazar said that Rebbi ruled like R. Meir.</p></div>
<div class="indent2"><span class="nm">1.</span><p><span class="cl">Question:</span> He ruled also like Chachamim!</p></div>
<div class="indent2"><span class="nm">2.</span><p><span class="cl">Answer:</span> R. Elazar only cited the ruling like R. Meir, for he knew that it was last.</p></div>
<div class="subject"><span class="nm">4)</span><p>ONE COVERING FOR MANY SLAUGHTERS</p></div>
<div class="indent1"><span class="nm">(a)</span><p><span class="cl">(Mishnah):</span> If a man slaughtered 100 Chayos or 100 birds in one place, one Kisuy suffices for all of them;</p></div>
<div class="indent1"><span class="nm">(b)</span><p>If he slaughtered a Chayah and bird in one place, he may cover them together;</p></div>
<div class="indent1"><span class="nm">(c)</span><p>R. Yehudah says, he must cover the Chayah's blood before he slaughters the bird.</p></div>
<div class="indent1"><span class="nm">(d)</span><p><span class="cl">(Gemara - Beraisa):</span> "Chayah" denotes one animal or many. The same applies to "Ohf".</p></div>
<div class="indent2"><span class="nm">1.</span><p>This teaches that one Kisuy suffices for many Chayos or birds;</p></div>
<div class="indent2"><span class="nm">2.</span><p>R. Yehudah says, he must cover the Chayah's blood before he slaughters the bird. We learn this from "Chayah Oh Ohf."</p></div>
<div class="indent2"><span class="nm">3.</span><p><span class="cl">Chachamim:</span> It says "the soul of all life is in its blood"!</p></div>
<div class="indent2"><span class="nm">4.</span><p><span class="cl">Question:</span> How does this counter R. Yehudah's proof?</p></div>
<div class="indent2"><span class="nm">5.</span><p><span class="cl">Answer:</span> (The Beraisa is abbreviated.) Chachamim first responded that "Oh" is needed to divide (Kisuy is required even if only a Chayah or bird is slaughtered);</p></div>
<div class="indent3"><span class="nm">i.</span><p><span class="cl">R. Yehudah:</span> "Its blood" teaches that the blood of even one of them must be covered.</p></div>
<div class="indent3"><span class="nm">ii.</span><p><span class="cl">Chachamim:</span> "Its blood" can connote the blood of more than one animal - "the soul of all life is in its blood".</p></div>
<div class="indent1"><span class="nm">(e)</span><p><span class="cl">(R. Chanina):</span> R. Yehudah agrees that one blessing suffices for Chayos and birds.</p></div>
<div class="indent1"><span class="nm">(f)</span><p><span class="cl">Question (Ravina):</span> Why is this different than the following episode?</p></div>
<div class="indent2"><span class="nm">1.</span><p>Rav Bruna and Rav Chananel were eating. They asked Rav Yeiva Sava (who was serving them) to bring the wine for Birkas ha'Mazon. They reconsidered, and asked him to bring wine to drink.</p></div>
<div class="indent2"><span class="nm">2.</span><p><span class="cl">Rav Yeiva:</span> Rav taught that once one says 'let us bless', he may not drink anymore (without blessing.)</p></div>
<div class="indent3"><span class="nm">i.</span><p>Here also, once you cover the blood of the Chayah, another blessing is needed for Kisuy of whatever else you will slaughter!</p></div>
<div class="indent1"><span class="nm">(g)</span><p><span class="cl">Answer (Rav Acha brei d'Rava):</span> The cases are different!</p></div>
<div class="indent2"><span class="nm">1.</span><p>One cannot drink while blessing, so intention to bless is an interruption;</p></div>
<div class="indent2"><span class="nm">2.</span><p>One can slaughter and cover blood at the same time (with different hands), so covering is not an interruption.</p></div>
