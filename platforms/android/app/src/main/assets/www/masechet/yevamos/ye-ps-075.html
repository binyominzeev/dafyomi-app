<p class="bas subject"><span class="nm">1)</span>THE DIFFERENT STAGES OF <i>TAHARAH</i></p>
<p class="bas indent1"><span class="nm">(a)</span><span class="cl">Answer to both questions (Rava):</span> We must say that the verse gives laws of Terumah <i>and</i> Kodshim.</p>
<p class="bas indent1"><span class="nm">(b)</span>There are three verses about Terumah. All are needed:</p>
<p class="bas indent2"><span class="nm">1.</span>"Until he will be Tahor" does not specify when this is, so we also need "At nightfall, he will be Tahor";</p>
<p class="bas indent2"><span class="nm">2.</span>Had it written only these verses, we would think they apply to one who is not Mechusar Kipurim; but a Mechusar Kipurim cannot eat until he brings his Korban. Therefore we need "Until the completion of her days of Taharah".</p>
<p class="bas indent2"><span class="nm">3.</span>Had it written only this last verse, we would think that Tevilah is not needed. Therefore, we also need "Until he will become Tahor".</p>
<p class="bas indent1"><span class="nm">(c)</span>A Tana argues with Tana d'Vei R. Yishmael (74a), and says that "Any man... who is a Metzora or Zav" discusses a Zav that saw three emissions and a Metzora Muchlat. "Until he becomes Tahor" means when he brings his Korban.</p>
<p class="bas indent1"><span class="nm">(d)</span><span class="cl">Question:</span> Why does this Tana require two verses about Kodshim?</p>
<p class="bas indent1"><span class="nm">(e)</span><span class="cl">Answer:</span> Had the Torah written only that a Yoledes must bring her Korban before eating Kodshim, one might have thought that this is because she is Teme'ah for a long time, but a Zav could eat before Kaparah;</p>
<p class="bas indent2"><span class="nm">1.</span>Had the Torah written only that a Zav needs Kaparah before eating, one might have thought that this is because his Tum'ah is never totally permitted, but a Yoledes is Tehorah (to her husband and to Ma'aser) even while seeing Dam (Tohar), so she could eat before bringing her Korban.</p>
<p class="bas indent1"><span class="nm">(f)</span><span class="cl">Question:</span> Why do we need "He will immerse and be Tamei until nightfall"?</p>
<p class="bas indent1"><span class="nm">(g)</span><span class="cl">Answer (R. Zeira):</span> This teaches that he is Metamei Terumah if he touches it before nightfall:</p>
<p class="bas indent2"><span class="nm">1.</span><span class="cl">(Beraisa) Suggestion:</span> "V'Tamei" - perhaps he is Tamei for everything!</p>
<p class="bas indent2"><span class="nm">2.</span><span class="cl">Rejection:</span> "V'Taher".</p>
<p class="bas indent2"><span class="nm">3.</span><span class="cl">Suggestion:</span> Perhaps "V'Taher" teaches that he is Tahor for everything!</p>
<p class="bas indent2"><span class="nm">4.</span><span class="cl">Rejection:</span> "V'Tamei".</p>
<p class="bas indent2"><span class="nm">5.</span><span class="cl">Resolution:</span> He is Tahor regarding (touching) Ma'aser, and Tamei regarding Terumah.</p>
<p class="bas indent1"><span class="nm">(h)</span><span class="cl">Question:</span> Perhaps he is Tahor regarding Terumah and Tamei regarding Ma'aser!</p>
<p class="bas indent1"><span class="nm">(i)</span><span class="cl">Answer #1:</span> Presumably, just like Terumah is more stringent than Ma'aser regarding eating, also regarding touching.</p>
<p class="bas indent1"><span class="nm">(j)</span><span class="cl">Answer #2:</span> "She will not touch <i>any</i> Kodesh and will not come to the Mikdash" warns a Yoledes (within Yemei Taharah) not to eat (Terumah)."</p>
<p class="bas indent1"><span class="nm">(k)</span><span class="cl">Question:</span> Perhaps this is a warning not to touch Terumah!</p>
<p class="bas indent1"><span class="nm">(l)</span><span class="cl">Answer:</span> The verse discusses touching (Kodesh) and entering the Mikdash. Just like one is Chayav Misah (b'Yedei Shamayim) for Bi'as Makdish, also for touching. 'Touching' must mean eating, since there is no Misah for touching;</p>
<p class="bas indent2"><span class="nm">1.</span>It calls eating "touching" to teach that touching Terumah is like eating it (whoever may not eat it may not touch it).</p>
<p class="bas subject"><span class="nm">2)</span>A PETZU'A DAKA</p>
<p class="bas indent1"><span class="nm">(a)</span><span class="cl">(Mishnah):</span> A Petzu'a Daka ... (if he did not have Bi'ah with his wife since he became a Petzu'a Dacha, she may eat Terumah).</p>
<p class="bas indent1"><span class="nm">(b)</span><span class="cl">Question:</span> Who is our Tana, who permits a woman to eat Terumah even if she is forbidden to her husband mid'Oraisa?</p>
<p class="bas indent1"><span class="nm">(c)</span><span class="cl">Answer #1 (R. Elazar):</span> Tana'im argue about this. Our Mishnah is like R. Elazar and R. Shimon (56b).</p>
<p class="bas indent1"><span class="nm">(d)</span><span class="cl">Answer #2 (R. Yochanan):</span> Our Mishnah is even like R. Meir. The case is, she already ate (before he became a Petzu'a Daka).</p>
<p class="bas indent2"><span class="nm">1.</span>R. Elazar holds that the fact that she already ate does not change matters. If it did, a Bas Yisrael widowed from a Kohen would continue to eat!</p>
<p class="bas indent2"><span class="nm">2.</span>R. Yochanan holds that there is different, since the Kohen's acquisition of her lapses when he dies.</p>
<p class="bas indent1"><span class="nm">(e)</span><span class="cl">(Beraisa) Question:</span> What constitutes a Petzu'a Daka?</p>
<p class="bas indent1"><span class="nm">(f)</span><span class="cl">Answer:</span> It is any man whose Beitzim were cut, even one of them, even if they were punctured, shriveled, or incomplete;</p>
<p class="bas indent1"><span class="nm">(g)</span>R. Yishmael, son of R. Yochanan ben Berokah says, anyone who only has one Beitzah is a Seris Chamah (due to sickness) and is Kosher (may marry).</p>
<p class="bas indent2"><span class="nm">1.</span><span class="cl">Objection:</span> This cannot be (due to illness)!</p>
<p class="bas indent2"><span class="nm">2.</span><span class="cl">Correction:</span> Rather, he is like a Seris Chamah, and is Kosher.</p>
<p class="bas indent1"><span class="nm">(h)</span><span class="cl">Question:</span> Is it really true that one whose Beitzim were punctured (is a Petzu'a Daka and he) cannot have children?!</p>
<p class="bas indent2"><span class="nm">1.</span>A case occurred in which a man climbed a date tree and his Beitzim were punctured by a thorn. Semen came out like pus, yet he fathered children afterwards!</p>
<p class="bas bbbline">75b----------------------------------------75b</p>
<p class="bas indent1"><span class="nm">(i)</span><span class="cl">Answer:</span> Shmuel declared that his children are Mamzerim (surely his wife become pregnant through another man).</p>
<p class="bas indent1"><span class="nm">(j)</span><span class="cl">(Rav Yehudah):</span> A Petzu'a Daka b'Yedei Shamayim is Kosher.</p>
<p class="bas indent2"><span class="nm">1.</span><span class="cl">(Rava):</span> This is why it does not say 'ha'Petzu'a' (connoting from the beginning), rather, "Petzu'a".</p>
<p class="bas indent1"><span class="nm">(k)</span><span class="cl">(Beraisa):</span> Right after "A Petzu'a Daka will not marry" it says "A Mamzer will not marry". Just like a Mamzer is due to man's actions, also a Petzu'a Daka.</p>
<p class="bas indent1"><span class="nm">(l)</span><span class="cl">(Rava):</span> The Torah forbids if any of them (the Ever, Beitzim, or strings on which the Beitzim are suspended) is Petzu'a (bruised), Dach (crushed) or Krus (cut off).</p>
<p class="bas indent1"><span class="nm">(m)</span><span class="cl">Question:</span> What is the source that Petzu'a Daka applies in that area? Perhaps it applies to the head!</p>
<p class="bas indent1"><span class="nm">(n)</span><span class="cl">Answer #1 (Rava):</span> The Torah did not say how many generations are forbidden. This implies that it is in that area (that makes him sterile).</p>
<p class="bas indent1"><span class="nm">(o)</span><span class="cl">Objection:</span> Perhaps it did not list generations because he is forbidden, but his offspring are permitted!</p>
<p class="bas indent1"><span class="nm">(p)</span><span class="cl">Answer #2 (Rava):</span> Petzu'a Daka is written next to Krus Shofchah. This shows that it applies to the same area.</p>
<p class="bas indent1"><span class="nm">(q)</span><span class="cl">Question:</span> How do we know that Krus Shofchah applies in that area? Perhaps it applies to the lips!</p>
<p class="bas indent1"><span class="nm">(r)</span><span class="cl">Answer:</span> "Shofchah (dripping)", in the place of dripping.</p>
<p class="bas indent2"><span class="nm">1.</span><span class="cl">Question:</span> Perhaps this refers to the nose!</p>
<p class="bas indent2"><span class="nm">2.</span><span class="cl">Answer:</span> 'Shofach Krus' would connote that the place that (normally) drips was cut. Rather, "Krus Shofchah" teaches that due to the cut it drips, but if it were not cut, it would flow. The nose drips in either case.</p>
<p class="bas indent1"><span class="nm">(s)</span><span class="cl">Answer #3 (Beraisa):</span> Right after "A Petzu'a Daka will not marry" it says "A Mamzer will not marry". Just like a Mamzer results from that area, also a Petzu'a Daka.</p>
<p class="bas subject"><span class="nm">3)</span>WHICH CUTS ARE A PROBLEM</p>
<p class="bas indent1"><span class="nm">(a)</span><span class="cl">(R. Chiya bar Aba):</span> If it is punctured below the crown, and the other side of the puncture is above the crown, the man is Kosher.</p>
<p class="bas indent1"><span class="nm">(b)</span><span class="cl">(R. Asi):</span> R. Yehoshua ben Levi says, the entire crown must be intact.</p>
<p class="bas indent1"><span class="nm">(c)</span><span class="cl">(Mishnah):</span> If there remains from the crown (a thread's width, he is Kosher).</p>
<p class="bas indent1"><span class="nm">(d)</span><span class="cl">Question (Ravina):</span> Must the thread's width be on the entire crown, or just on the majority?</p>
<p class="bas indent1"><span class="nm">(e)</span><span class="cl">Answer (Rabah Tosfa'ah):</span> It must be on the majority, and towards the body.</p>
<p class="bas indent1"><span class="nm">(f)</span><span class="cl">(Rav Huna):</span> If the Ever is cut on a slant like a quill, he is Kosher. If it is grooved like a gutter pipe, he is forbidden.</p>
<p class="bas indent2"><span class="nm">1.</span>In the latter case, it is cooled by the air (it cannot be heated enough to cook the semen to enable conception). In the former case, it is not.</p>
<p class="bas indent1"><span class="nm">(g)</span><span class="cl">(Rav Chisda):</span> If it is like a gutter pipe, he is Kosher. If it is like a quill, he is forbidden.</p>
<p class="bas indent2"><span class="nm">1.</span>In the former case, it rubs (against the uterus and gets heated). In the latter case, it does not.</p>
<p class="bas indent1"><span class="nm">(h)</span><span class="cl">(Rava):</span> Presumably, Rav Huna is correct. We are concerned for air but not for rubbing, since further down it is wider, like a barrel.</p>
<p class="bas indent1"><span class="nm">(i)</span><span class="cl">Ravina (to Mereimar):</span> Rav Papa ruled that he is Kosher whether it is like a quill or a gutter pipe;</p>
<p class="bas indent2"><span class="nm">1.</span>However, he was unsure if this is above the crown (towards the body) or below.</p>
<p class="bas indent1"><span class="nm">(j)</span><span class="cl">Objection:</span> Certainly, this must be above. Below, even if the Ever was cut off he is Kosher!</p>
<p class="bas indent1"><span class="nm">(k)</span><span class="cl">Answer:</span> Indeed, Ravina was just testing Mereimar.</p>
<p class="bas indent1"><span class="nm">(l)</span>There was a man whose Ever was like a gutter pipe. Mar bar Rav Ashi cut flesh to make it like a quill, and declared that he is Kosher.</p>
