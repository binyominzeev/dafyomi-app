<div class="subject"><span class="nm">1)</span><p>THE PLACE AND DIMENSIONS OF THE <i>MIZBE'ACH</i></p></div>
<div class="indent1"><span class="nm">(a)</span><p><span class="cl">Answer #3 (Rav Yosef (he retracted from his first answer) - Beraisa):</span> "Va'Yachinu ha'Mizbe'ach Al Mechonosav" - (in the days of Ezra) they realized how large the Mizbe'ach may be.</p></div>
<div class="indent2"><span class="nm">1.</span><p><span class="cl">Question:</span> "Ha'Kol bi'Chsav mi'Yad Hash-m Alai Hiskil" (Hash-m taught David the dimensions of the Mikdash. Any change requires a procedure including the Urim v'Tumim, which was not in Bayis Sheni!)</p></div>
<div class="indent2"><span class="nm">2.</span><p><span class="cl">Answer (Rav Yosef):</span> They expounded "Zeh Hu Beis Hash-m ha'Elokim v'Zeh Mizbe'ach l'Olah" - the Mizbe'ach is like Beis Hash-m (the Heichal), i.e. it is (at most) 60 Amos long.</p></div>
<div class="indent1"><span class="nm">(b)</span><p><span class="cl">Question:</span> Granted, those who built Bayis Sheni could tell where to rebuild the Heichal, they could see the foundations of the (destroyed) walls;</p></div>
<div class="indent2"><span class="nm">1.</span><p>How did they know where to put the Mizbe'ach?</p></div>
<div class="indent1"><span class="nm">(c)</span><p><span class="cl">Answer #1 (R. Elazar):</span> They saw (with Ru'ach ha'Kodesh) the Mizbe'ach built (in its proper place) and (the angel) Micha'el offering Korbanos on it.</p></div>
<div class="indent1"><span class="nm">(d)</span><p><span class="cl">Answer #2 (R. Yitzchak Nafcha):</span> They saw the ashes of Yitzchak (Hash-m considers it as if Avraham slaughtered and burned him like an Olah) in its place.</p></div>
<div class="indent1"><span class="nm">(e)</span><p><span class="cl">Answer #3 (R. Shmuel bar Nachmani):</span> Everywhere else in the Mikdash, they smelled Ketores. In that place they smelled (burning) meat.</p></div>
<div class="indent1"><span class="nm">(f)</span><p><span class="cl">Answer #4 (Rabah bar bar Chanah):</span> Three prophets (Chagai, Zecharyah and Malachi) accompanied them from Bavel. One testified that the Mizbe'ach may be up to 60 Amos, one testified where the Mizbe'ach should be, and one testified that we may bring Korbanos (if the Mizbe'ach is in the proper place) even without the Beis ha'Mikdash.</p></div>
<div class="indent1"><span class="nm">(g)</span><p><span class="cl">(Beraisa - R. Eliezer ben Yakov):</span> Three prophets accompanied them from Bavel. One testified that the Mizbe'ach may be up to 60 Amos and where it should be, one testified that we may bring Korbanos even without the Mikdash, and one permitted them to write the Torah in Ashuris (the letter forms that we use today).</p></div>
<div class="subject"><span class="nm">2)</span><p>REQUIREMENTS OF THE <i>MIZBE'ACH</i></p></div>
<div class="indent1"><span class="nm">(a)</span><p><span class="cl">(Beraisa):</span> The following are Me'akev (essential for) Kashrus of the Mizbe'ach: it must have Keranos, a ramp, a Yesod, and it must be square;</p></div>
<div class="indent2"><span class="nm">1.</span><p>The following are not Me'akev - its length, width and height.</p></div>
<div class="indent1"><span class="nm">(b)</span><p><span class="cl">Question:</span> What is the source of this?</p></div>
<div class="indent1"><span class="nm">(c)</span><p><span class="cl">Answer (Rav Huna):</span> Wherever it says "ha'Mizbe'ach", it is Me'akev.</p></div>
<div class="indent1"><span class="nm">(d)</span><p><span class="cl">Question:</span> If so, Rebbi should say that Kiyur (pictures) is Me'akev, and R. Yosi b'Rebbi Yehudah should say that the Sovev is Me'akev!</p></div>
<div class="indent2"><span class="nm">1.</span><p><span class="cl">(Beraisa - Rebbi):</span> "V'Nasatah Osah Tachas <i>Karkuv</i> ha'Mizbe'ach" refers to pictures on the top half of the Mizbe'ach;</p></div>
<div class="indent2"><span class="nm">2.</span><p>R. Yosi b'Rebbi Yehudah says, it refers to the Sovev.</p></div>
<div class="indent1"><span class="nm">(e)</span><p><span class="cl">Answer:</span> Indeed, they say this!</p></div>
<div class="indent2"><span class="nm">1.</span><p><span class="cl">(Beraisa):</span> (The Tzedukim (a sect that did not accept Torah she'Ba'al Peh) denied the Mitzvah to pour water on the Mizbe'ach on Sukos. Once, a Tzeduki poured the water on his feet. Everyone threw (rocks and) Esrogim at him.) The Mizbe'ach became dented, and they sealed it with salt;</p></div>
<div class="indent2"><span class="nm">2.</span><p>This was not Machshir Avodah. It was in order that the Mizbe'ach not appear deficient.</p></div>
<div class="indent2"><span class="nm">3.</span><p>The Mizbe'ach is Pasul unless it has Keranos, a ramp, a Yesod, and is square.</p></div>
<div class="indent2"><span class="nm">4.</span><p>R. Yosi b'Rebbi Yehudah says, it must also have a Sovev. (Likewise, Rebbi would require pictures.)</p></div>
<div class="indent1"><span class="nm">(f)</span><p><span class="cl">(Beraisa):</span> The Karkuv is between the Keranos, where the Kohanim walk, an Amah wide.</p></div>
<div class="indent1"><span class="nm">(g)</span><p><span class="cl">Objection:</span> The Kohanim do not walk between the Keranos! (If they did, they would not be able to turn the corner.)</p></div>
<div class="indent1"><span class="nm">(h)</span><p><span class="cl">Correction:</span> Rather, (the Karkuv is between the Keranos) <i>and</i> the Amah-wide walkway of the Kohanim.</p></div>
<div class="indent1"><span class="nm">(i)</span><p><span class="cl">Question:</span> "Tachas Karkuvo mi'Lmatah Ad Chetzyo" shows that it was on the outside of the Mizbe'ach!</p></div>
<div class="indent1"><span class="nm">(j)</span><p><span class="cl">Answer (Rav Nachman bar Yitzchak):</span> There were two Karkuvim. One was (a protrusion around the Sovev) for decoration. The other was a rim around the walkway (which was sunken), in order that the Kohanim not slip.</p></div>
<div class="indent1"><span class="nm">(k)</span><p><span class="cl">(Beraisa):</span> The length, width and height of the Mizbe'ach are not Me'akev.</p></div>
<div class="indent1"><span class="nm">(l)</span><p><span class="cl">(R. Mani):</span> However, they cannot be less than Moshe's Mizbe'ach.</p></div>
<div class="indent1"><span class="nm">(m)</span><p><span class="cl">Question:</span> What was the length (this is also the width, for it was square) of Moshe's Mizbe'ach?</p></div>
<div class="indent1"><span class="nm">(n)</span><p><span class="cl">Answer (Rav Yosef):</span> It was an Amah.</p></div>
<div class="indent2"><span class="nm">1.</span><p>People laughed at this. It says "Chamesh Amos Orech v'Chamesh Amos Rochav Ravu'a Yihyeh"!</p></div>
<div class="indent2"><span class="nm">2.</span><p><span class="cl">Abaye:</span> Perhaps you mean that the place of the Ma'arachah was an Amah (the Keranos occupied one Amah on each side, and also the walkway)!</p></div>
<div class="indent2"><span class="nm">3.</span><p><span class="cl">Rav Yosef:</span> A great person (like yourself) understands what I meant. Those who laughed are like Bnei Keturah (inferior descendants of Avraham).</p></div>
<div class="bbbline">62b----------------------------------------62b</p></div>
<div class="indent1"><span class="nm">(o)</span><p>R. Tarfon was teaching. His nephews were listening silently. He (mis)cited a verse (to break their silence) 'va'Yosef Avraham va'Yikach Ishah u'Shmah Yuchni.'</p></div>
<div class="indent2"><span class="nm">1.</span><p><span class="cl">His nephews:</span> It says "Keturah"!</p></div>
<div class="indent2"><span class="nm">2.</span><p><span class="cl">R. Tarfon:</span> You are like Bnei Keturah.</p></div>
<div class="indent1"><span class="nm">(p)</span><p><span class="cl">(Abaye bar Huna):</span> The woods that Moshe made for the Ma'arachah were one square Amah (each), the thickness was like a Machak (the rod used to even off a measure) of a Se'ah (it has a standard thickness. If it is too heavy (or light), it will sag too much (or not enough) into the measure.)</p></div>
<div class="indent1"><span class="nm">(q)</span><p><span class="cl">(R. Yirmeyah):</span> They were slightly less than a square Amah (our text, Rashi; Aruch - slightly more than a square Amah.</p></div>
<div class="indent1"><span class="nm">(r)</span><p><span class="cl">Objection (Rav Yosef - Beraisa):</span> "Al ha'Etzim Asher Al ha'Esh Asher Al ha'Mizbe'ach" teaches that the wood may not leave the Ma'arachah at all. (Aruch - according to R. Yirmeyah, they could not fit in the Ma'arachah! Rashi (according to Shitah Mekubetzes) - there is no reason to make the woods less than a full Amah. Rashi (according to Tzon Kodoshim) - Rav Yosef <i>supports</i> R. Yirmeyah.)</p></div>
<div class="subject"><span class="nm">3)</span><p>THE RAMP</p></div>
<div class="indent1"><span class="nm">(a)</span><p><span class="cl">(Mishnah):</span> The ramp was on the south of the Mizbe'ach, it was 32 Amos long and 16 Amos wide.</p></div>
<div class="indent1"><span class="nm">(b)</span><p><span class="cl">Question:</span> What is the source of this?</p></div>
<div class="indent1"><span class="nm">(c)</span><p><span class="cl">Answer #1 (Rav Huna):</span> "V'Shachat Oso Al Yerech ha'Mizbe'ach Tzafonah" - the leg of the Mizbe'ach is in the north. It follows that its face (the side that we approach) is in the south.</p></div>
<div class="indent2"><span class="nm">1.</span><p><span class="cl">Question:</span> Perhaps the leg and face are both in the north!</p></div>
<div class="indent2"><span class="nm">2.</span><p><span class="cl">Answer (Rava):</span> When one lies down, his leg and face are in opposite directions.</p></div>
<div class="indent2"><span class="nm">3.</span><p><span class="cl">Question (Abaye):</span> When one sits, his leg and face are in the same direction!</p></div>
<div class="indent2"><span class="nm">4.</span><p><span class="cl">Answer (Rava):</span> It says "Ravu'a" (this is close to 'Ravutz', lying).</p></div>
<div class="indent2"><span class="nm">5.</span><p><span class="cl">Question:</span> We need this to teach that it must be square!</p></div>
<div class="indent2"><span class="nm">6.</span><p><span class="cl">Answer:</span> If so, it should have said 'Meruba'.</p></div>
<div class="indent2"><span class="nm">7.</span><p><span class="cl">Question:</span> If the Torah wanted to teach that we consider one lying down, it should have said 'Ravutz'!</p></div>
<div class="indent2"><span class="nm">8.</span><p><span class="cl">Answer:</span> It says "Ravu'a", which is close to 'Ravutz' and 'Meruba', allowing us to learn both.</p></div>
<div class="indent1"><span class="nm">(d)</span><p><span class="cl">Answer #2 (Beraisa - R. Yehudah):</span> "U'Ma'alosehu Penos Kadim" - its ramps (are situated so that when you) turn to (your right, this is to the) east.</p></div>
<div class="indent1"><span class="nm">(e)</span><p><span class="cl">Question:</span> Perhaps when you turn to your left, this is eastward!</p></div>
<div class="indent1"><span class="nm">(f)</span><p><span class="cl">Rejection (Rami bar Yechezkeil - Beraisa):</span> Shlomo's Yam (Mikveh) rested on 12 supports - "Sheloshah Ponim Tzafonah u'Sheloshah Ponim Yamah... Ponim Negbah... Ponim Mizrachah" (the verse lists them in the order of one who starts in the north and circles around to his right);</p></div>
<div class="indent2"><span class="nm">1.</span><p>This teaches that whenever we circle around, it is to the right.</p></div>
<div class="indent1"><span class="nm">(g)</span><p><span class="cl">Question:</span> The verse teaches about the supports, we cannot learn anything else from it!</p></div>
<div class="indent1"><span class="nm">(h)</span><p><span class="cl">Answer:</span> It was not necessary to repeat "Ponim" each time. The repetition teaches that we always circle to the right.</p></div>
<div class="indent1"><span class="nm">(i)</span><p><span class="cl">Question (R. Shimon ben Yosi ben Lekunya):</span> Did R. Shimon say that there is a space between the ramp and the Mizbe'ach?</p></div>
<div class="indent1"><span class="nm">(j)</span><p><span class="cl">Answer (R. Yosi):</span> Don't you agree? "V'Asisa Olosecha ha'Basar veha'Dam" - just like blood of an Olah is thrown (on two edges of the Mizbe'ach), also the meat is thrown (across the space, to the fire).</p></div>
<div class="indent1"><span class="nm">(k)</span><p><span class="cl">Question (R. Shimon ben Yosi):</span> I say that (there is no space;) he stands next to the Ma'arachah and throws the meat!</p></div>
<div class="indent1"><span class="nm">(l)</span><p><span class="cl">Answer #1 (R. Yosi):</span> Obviously, he must throw to a part of the Ma'arachah that is aflame! It is impossible (for the flame to reach to where the Kohen stands. Rather, the verse teaches that he throws over a space.)</p></div>
<div class="indent1"><span class="nm">(m)</span><p><span class="cl">Answer #2 (Rav Papa):</span> You cannot say that he stands next to the Ma'arachah and throws. The verse equates meat to blood, which is thrown through air over the ground.</p></div>
<div class="indent1"><span class="nm">(n)</span><p><span class="cl">(Rav Yehudah):</span> Two small ramps emerged from the main ramp. One led to the Yesod, and the other led to the Sovev;</p></div>
<div class="indent2"><span class="nm">1.</span><p>They did not touch the Mizbe'ach. They were separated by a hair's breadth, for it says "Saviv". (It must be possible to put something around the Mizbe'ach, i.e. nothing touches it externally.)</p></div>
<div class="indent2"><span class="nm">2.</span><p><span class="cl">(R. Avahu):</span> We learn this from "Ravu'a".</p></div>
<div class="indent1"><span class="nm">(o)</span><p>The Torah needed to say "Saviv" and "Ravu'a";</p></div>
<div class="indent2"><span class="nm">1.</span><p>Had it said only "Saviv", one might have thought that the Mizbe'ach may be round;</p></div>
<div class="indent2"><span class="nm">2.</span><p>Had it said only "Ravu'a", one might have thought that the Mizbe'ach may be long and thin (as long as it is rectangular).</p></div>
<div class="indent1"><span class="nm">(p)</span><p><span class="cl">(Mishnah):</span> The ramp and the Mizbe'ach (together) occupied 62 Amos.</p></div>
<div class="indent1"><span class="nm">(q)</span><p><span class="cl">Question:</span> Together they occupy 64! (Each of them was 32 Amos),</p></div>
<div class="indent1"><span class="nm">(r)</span><p><span class="cl">Answer:</span> The ramp overlaps one Amah that the Yesod juts out, and one Amah of the Sovev.</p></div>
<div class="indent1"><span class="nm">(s)</span><p><span class="cl">(Rami bar Chama):</span> All ramps in the Mikdash, for every three Amos (horizontally; Shitah Mekubetzes - along the diagonal), the ramp rises one Amah, except for the ramp to the Mizbe'ach. It rose one Amah for every three and a half Amos and a one and a third fingers. (It was less steep so that Kohanim would not slip, for they had to ascend carrying limbs, which are heavy);</p></div>
<div class="indent2"><span class="nm">1.</span><p>'Fingers' refers to Zachrusa (the thick part of the thumb; some texts - Zutrasa, i.e. pinkies, a sixth of a Tefach).</p></div>
