<p class="bas subject"><span class="nm">1)</span>HOW MANY JUDGES GO OUT?</p>
<p class="bas indent1"><span class="nm">(a)</span><span class="cl">Question:</span> If R. Yehudah and R. Shimon learn this way, each should learn two additional judges from "they will go out" and another two from "they will measure"!</p>
<p class="bas indent1"><span class="nm">(b)</span><span class="cl">Answer:</span> Those words teach other laws. "They will go out", not their messengers. "They will measure", even if it is obvious which city is closest, for it is a Mitzvah to measure.</p>
<p class="bas indent1"><span class="nm">(c)</span>Our Mishnah is unlike R. Eliezer ben Yakov.</p>
<p class="bas indent2"><span class="nm">1.</span><span class="cl">(Beraisa - R. Eliezer ben Yakov):</span> "Your elders" refers to the (great) Sanhedrin. "Your judges" refers to the king and the Kohen Gadol.</p>
<p class="bas indent2"><span class="nm">2.</span>Other verses call the king and the Kohen Gadol "judges".</p>
<p class="bas indent1"><span class="nm">(d)</span><span class="cl">Question:</span> Does R. Eliezer ben Yakov hold that the entire Sanhedrin goes out, or only five or three like R. Yehudah or R. Shimon?</p>
<p class="bas indent1"><span class="nm">(e)</span><span class="cl">Answer (Rav Yosef - Beraisa) Suggestion:</span> If a defiant sage finds the great Sanhedrin by Bei Pagi (within Yerushalayim) and rules against them, perhaps this is considered rebellion (and he is liable)!</p>
<p class="bas indent2"><span class="nm">1.</span><span class="cl">Rejection:</span> "You will ascend to the place" - rebellion is only when they are in their place (Lishkas ha'Gazis, a chamber partially in the Mikdash).</p>
<p class="bas indent2"><span class="nm">2.</span><span class="cl">Question:</span> How many members of the Sanhedrin were by Bei Pagi?</p>
<p class="bas indent3"><span class="nm">i.</span><span class="cl">Suggestion:</span> Not all of them were there.</p>
<p class="bas indent3"><span class="nm">ii.</span><span class="cl">Rejection:</span> In any place this is not rebellion. Perhaps the other members would agree with the sage!</p>
<p class="bas indent2"><span class="nm">3.</span><span class="cl">Answer:</span> We must say that the entire Sanhedrin was there.</p>
<p class="bas indent2"><span class="nm">4.</span><span class="cl">Question:</span> Why did they leave their normal place?</p>
<p class="bas indent3"><span class="nm">i.</span><span class="cl">Suggestion:</span> They leave for a reason that is not a Mitzvah.</p>
<p class="bas indent3"><span class="nm">ii.</span><span class="cl">Rejection:</span> That is forbidden! A judge may not leave the great Sanhedrin unless at least 23 judges remain.</p>
<p class="bas indent2"><span class="nm">5.</span><span class="cl">Answer:</span> Rather, we must say that they all left for a Mitzvah.</p>
<p class="bas indent3"><span class="nm">i.</span><span class="cl">Suggestion:</span> This Beraisa is like R. Eliezer ben Yakov. They left to measure from a corpse!</p>
<p class="bas indent1"><span class="nm">(f)</span><span class="cl">Rejection (Abaye):</span> No, perhaps they left to add on to Yerushalayim or the courtyards of the Mikdash;</p>
<p class="bas indent2"><span class="nm">1.</span><span class="cl">(Mishnah):</span> All 71 members of the Sanhedrin are needed to add on to Yerushalayim or the courtyards of the Mikdash.</p>
<p class="bas indent1"><span class="nm">(g)</span><span class="cl">Support (for Rav Yosef - Beraisa) Suggestion:</span> If a defiant sage finds the great Sanhedrin by Bei Pagi and rules against them, e.g. they left to measure from a corpse, or to add on to Yerushalayim or the courtyards of the Mikdash, perhaps this is considered rebellion!</p>
<p class="bas indent2"><span class="nm">1.</span><span class="cl">Rejection:</span> "You will ascend to the place" - rebellion is only when they are in their place.</p>
<p class="bas subject"><span class="nm">2)</span>DOES <i>SHICHECHAH </i>APPLY TO PRODUCE NOT ON THE GROUND?</p>
<p class="bas indent1"><span class="nm">(a)</span><span class="cl">(Mishnah):</span> If a corpse was found covered or hanging from a tree...</p>
<p class="bas indent1"><span class="nm">(b)</span><span class="cl">Suggestion:</span> Our Mishnah is like R. Yehudah, and unlike Chachamim:</p>
<p class="bas indent2"><span class="nm">1.</span><span class="cl">(Beraisa - R. Yehudah):</span> "And you forgot a sheaf in the field" excludes a covered sheaf (from the law of Shichechah, forgotten produce that must be left for the poor);</p>
<p class="bas indent2"><span class="nm">2.</span>Chachamim say, "in the field" includes a covered sheaf.</p>
<p class="bas indent1"><span class="nm">(c)</span><span class="cl">Rejection (Rav):</span> Our Mishnah is even like Chachamim. In each case, we learn from the context of the verse;</p>
<p class="bas indent2"><span class="nm">1.</span>"If you will find a corpse" connotes any way he is found. "In the ground" excludes if he is covered;</p>
<p class="bas indent2"><span class="nm">2.</span>"If you will harvest in your field, and forget a sheaf" equates Shichechah to what is harvested. Just like one harvests what is exposed, also Shichechah must be exposed;</p>
<p class="bas indent3"><span class="nm">i.</span>The verse continues "in the field" to include what is covered.</p>
<p class="bas indent1"><span class="nm">(d)</span><span class="cl">Question:</span> R. Yehudah should also learn that Shichechah must be exposed, like the harvest. He should not need a verse to exclude what is covered!</p>
<p class="bas indent1"><span class="nm">(e)</span><span class="cl">Answer:</span> Correct! Indeed, he uses "in your field" to teach that Shichechah applies to attached vegetation.</p>
<p class="bas indent1"><span class="nm">(f)</span><span class="cl">Question:</span> What is Chachamim's source for this?</p>
<p class="bas indent1"><span class="nm">(g)</span><span class="cl">Answer:</span> They learn from "if you will harvest in your field, and forget."</p>
<p class="bas indent1"><span class="nm">(h)</span>R. Yehudah uses that to teach R. Avahu's law.</p>
<p class="bas indent2"><span class="nm">1.</span><span class="cl">(R. Avahu):</span> "In your field" excludes sheaves that floated to a neighbor's field.</p>
<p class="bas indent2"><span class="nm">2.</span>Chachamim would have included attached vegetation even if the Torah said 'in the field.' Rather, it says "in your field" to teach also R. Avahu's law.</p>
<p class="bas indent2"><span class="nm">3.</span>R. Yehudah holds that this change of wording does not warrant expounding another law.</p>
<p class="bas indent1"><span class="nm">(i)</span><span class="cl">Question (R. Yirmeyah):</span> If the wind lifted sheaves onto a rock, can they become Shichechah?</p>
<p class="bas indent2"><span class="nm">1.</span>Is something resting in the airspace of the field as if it is on the field, or not?</p>
<p class="bas indent1"><span class="nm">(j)</span><span class="cl">Answer #1 (Rav Kahana):</span> We can learn from R. Avahu.</p>
<p class="bas indent2"><span class="nm">1.</span>R. Avahu taught that if sheaves floated to a neighbor's field (and are still off the ground, e.g. on a rock) they are not Shichechah. The same case in his own field would be Shichechah!</p>
<p class="bas indent1"><span class="nm">(k)</span><span class="cl">Objection:</span> If this were a valid inference, one should also infer that only sheaves above his neighbor's field are not Shichechah, but sheaves on the field are Shichechah!</p>
<p class="bas indent2"><span class="nm">1.</span><span class="cl">Question:</span> It says "in your field", and this is not fulfilled!</p>
<p class="bas indent2"><span class="nm">2.</span><span class="cl">Answer:</span> Rather, we must say that whenever sheaves float to his neighbor's field; even if they are on the ground, they are not Shichechah;</p>
<p class="bas indent3"><span class="nm">i.</span>R. Avahu said floated because this is the only way it would come (by itself) to his neighbor's field.</p>
<p class="bas indent1"><span class="nm">(l)</span><span class="cl">Answer #2 (Beraisa):</span> If a landowner picked up a sheaf to take it to the city, put it on another sheaf, and forgot it, the bottom sheaf is Shichechah, but the top sheaf is not;</p>
<p class="bas indent2"><span class="nm">1.</span>R. Shimon ben Yehudah says, the bottom sheaf is not Shichechah, for it is covered. The top sheaf is not Shichechah, for it is elevated.</p>
<p class="bas indent2"><span class="nm">2.</span><span class="cl">(Summation of answer):</span> Both Tana'im agree that the top sheaf is not Shichechah because it is not on the ground!</p>
<p class="bas indent1"><span class="nm">(m)</span><span class="cl">Rejection:</span> No. He acquired it when he picked it up (therefore it can never become Shichechah).</p>
<p class="bas indent1"><span class="nm">(n)</span><span class="cl">Question:</span> If so, why does it say that he put it on top of another sheaf? Even if it were on the ground, it would not be Shichechah!</p>
<p class="bas indent1"><span class="nm">(o)</span><span class="cl">Answer:</span> That is true! The Beraisa discusses when he put it on another sheaf to teach the argument about the bottom sheaf.</p>
<p class="bas indent1"><span class="nm">(p)</span><span class="cl">Objection:</span> It says that the top sheaf is not Shichechah because it is elevated!</p>
<p class="bas indent1"><span class="nm">(q)</span><span class="cl">Answer:</span> It means, the top sheaf is not Shichechah because it is as if it elevated, i.e. still in his hand.</p>
<p class="bas indent1"><span class="nm">(r)</span><span class="cl">Question:</span> If one corpse is found resting on another, for which do we measure (to bring Eglah Arufah)?</p>
<p class="bas indent2"><span class="nm">1.</span>Do we say that the bottom corpse is considered covered (even though the covering is also a corpse), but the top corpse is not considered elevated (since another corpse cannot be considered a separation from the ground, therefore, we measure for the top corpse)?</p>
<p class="bas indent2"><span class="nm">2.</span>Or, do we say that a corpse is not considered a covering for a corpse, but the top corpse is considered elevated even though it rests on another corpse, therefore, we measure for the bottom corpse?</p>
<p class="bas indent2"><span class="nm">3.</span>Or, do we say that they are covered and elevated, respectively, and no calf is brought? (Or, are they neither covered nor elevated, and we measure for each?)</p>
<p class="bas bbbline">45b----------------------------------------45b</p>
<p class="bas indent1"><span class="nm">(s)</span><span class="cl">Answer (Abaye):</span> We can settle (the law of the bottom corpse) from the Beraisa.</p>
<p class="bas indent2"><span class="nm">1.</span><span class="cl">(Beraisa):</span> If a landowner picked up a sheaf to take it to the city, put it on another sheaf, and forgot it, the bottom sheaf is Shichechah, but the top sheaf is not;</p>
<p class="bas indent2"><span class="nm">2.</span>R. Shimon ben Yehudah says, the bottom sheaf is not Shichechah, for it is covered. The top sheaf is not Shichechah, for it is elevated.</p>
<p class="bas indent2"><span class="nm">3.</span><span class="cl">(Assumption):</span> Both Tana'im hold like R. Yehudah, that a covered sheaf can be Shichechah. They argue about whether or not a sheaf is considered a covering for another sheaf.</p>
<p class="bas indent1"><span class="nm">(t)</span><span class="cl">Rejection:</span> No. All agree that a sheaf is considered a covering for another sheaf. They argue about whether or not Shichechah applies to a covered sheaf.</p>
<p class="bas indent2"><span class="nm">1.</span><span class="cl">Question:</span> If so, why does it say that a sheaf covers the bottom sheaf? The first Tana would say that it is Shichechah even if it is covered by soil!</p>
<p class="bas indent2"><span class="nm">2.</span><span class="cl">Answer:</span> That is true. The Tana wanted to show the extremity of R. Yehudah, that even a sheaf covered by a sheaf is not Shichechah.</p>
<p class="bas subject"><span class="nm">3)</span>CORPSES FOR WHICH A CALF IS NOT BROUGHT</p>
<p class="bas indent1"><span class="nm">(a)</span><span class="cl">(Beraisa):</span> "A corpse" (connotes one killed by a sword, and excludes one who died by choking. "A corpse" excludes one still quivering. "On the ground" excludes one covered in a rock heap. "That fell" excludes one hanging from a tree. "On the field" excludes one floating on the water;</p>
<p class="bas indent1"><span class="nm">(b)</span>R. Eliezer says, we bring a calf for any corpse (killed by a sword, even if it is quivering, covered, hanging or floating).</p>
<p class="bas indent2"><span class="nm">1.</span><span class="cl">Chachamim:</span> You admit that if he choked, even if he rests on the ground, we do not bring a calf. Why do you argue about the other teachings?</p>
<p class="bas indent2"><span class="nm">2.</span><span class="cl">R. Eliezer:</span> I admit only to the first, since an extra "corpse" is written.</p>
<p class="bas indent1"><span class="nm">(c)</span><span class="cl">(Mishnah):</span> If it was found close to the border, or near a city that is mostly Nochrim...</p>
<p class="bas indent1"><span class="nm">(d)</span>No calf is brought, for it says "if you will find" to exclude such cases, for corpses are regularly found there.</p>
<p class="bas indent1"><span class="nm">(e)</span><span class="cl">(Mishnah):</span> Or to a city without a Sanhedrin...</p>
<p class="bas indent1"><span class="nm">(f)</span>This is because the elders (Sanhedrin) of the city must come out, and this cannot be fulfilled.</p>
<p class="bas indent1"><span class="nm">(g)</span><span class="cl">(Mishnah):</span> We measure only to a city with a Sanhedrin...</p>
<p class="bas indent1"><span class="nm">(h)</span><span class="cl">Question:</span> This is obvious. Since only a city with a Sanhedrin brings a calf, it is futile to measure to a city without a Sanhedrin!</p>
<p class="bas indent1"><span class="nm">(i)</span><span class="cl">Answer:</span> The Mishnah teaches like the following Beraisa:</p>
<p class="bas indent2"><span class="nm">1.</span><span class="cl">(Beraisa) Question:</span> What is the source that if it was found closest to a city without a Sanhedrin, we measure to the closest city with a Sanhedrin (and bring a calf)?</p>
<p class="bas indent2"><span class="nm">2.</span><span class="cl">Answer:</span> "The elders of that city will take" - in any case.</p>
<p class="bas subject"><span class="nm">4)</span>THE MEASUREMENT</p>
<p class="bas indent1"><span class="nm">(a)</span><span class="cl">(Mishnah - R. Eliezer):</span> If it is found to be exactly midway between two cities, each city brings a calf.</p>
<p class="bas indent1"><span class="nm">(b)</span>Yerushalayim does not bring a calf.</p>
<p class="bas indent1"><span class="nm">(c)</span>R. Eliezer says, if the head was not near the body, we bring the head to the body;</p>
<p class="bas indent1"><span class="nm">(d)</span>R. Akiva says, we bring the body to the head.</p>
<p class="bas indent1"><span class="nm">(e)</span>R. Eliezer says, we measure from the navel;</p>
<p class="bas indent1"><span class="nm">(f)</span>R. Akiva says, we measure from the nose;</p>
<p class="bas indent1"><span class="nm">(g)</span>R. Eliezer ben Yakov says, we measure from the place he became a corpse, from the neck.</p>
<p class="bas indent1"><span class="nm">(h)</span><span class="cl">(Gemara) Question:</span> Why does R. Eliezer say that two calves are beheaded?</p>
<p class="bas indent1"><span class="nm">(i)</span><span class="cl">Answer:</span> He holds that it is possible that it is exactly in the middle, and he expounds "the closest city" to means the closest cities (if two are equally close).</p>
<p class="bas indent1"><span class="nm">(j)</span><span class="cl">(Mishnah):</span> Yerushalayim does not bring a calf.</p>
<p class="bas indent2"><span class="nm">1.</span>This is because it says "in the land that you were given to inherit it", and the Tana holds that Yerushalayim was not apportioned to the Shevatim.</p>
<p class="bas indent1"><span class="nm">(k)</span><span class="cl">(Mishnah):</span> If the head was not near the body...</p>
<p class="bas indent1"><span class="nm">(l)</span><span class="cl">Question:</span> What do they argue about?</p>
<p class="bas indent2"><span class="nm">1.</span><span class="cl">Suggestion:</span> They argue about from where we measure.</p>
<p class="bas indent2"><span class="nm">2.</span><span class="cl">Rejection:</span> Later, the Mishnah asks from where we measure. This implies that it does not address this earlier!</p>
<p class="bas indent1"><span class="nm">(m)</span><span class="cl">Answer (R. Yitzchak):</span> An unattended corpse is buried in its place. They argue about where to bury it when the head and body are not in the same place;</p>
<p class="bas indent2"><span class="nm">1.</span>R. Eliezer says that it is buried where the body is. R. Akiva says, it is buried where the head is.</p>
<p class="bas indent2"><span class="nm">2.</span><span class="cl">Question:</span> What are their reasons?</p>
<p class="bas indent2"><span class="nm">3.</span><span class="cl">Answer:</span> R. Eliezer holds that he died where the body is, and the head rolled. R. Akiva holds that he died where the head is, and his body kept walking after the head was severed.</p>
<p class="bas indent1"><span class="nm">(n)</span><span class="cl">(Mishnah):</span> From where do we measure?</p>
<p class="bas indent1"><span class="nm">(o)</span><span class="cl">Question:</span> What do they argue about?</p>
<p class="bas indent1"><span class="nm">(p)</span><span class="cl">Answer:</span> R. Akiva says that the source of life is the nose; R. Eliezer says that it is the stomach.</p>
<p class="bas indent1"><span class="nm">(q)</span><span class="cl">Suggestion:</span> They argue like the following Tana'im:</p>
<p class="bas indent2"><span class="nm">1.</span><span class="cl">(Beraisa):</span> The initial creation of a fetus is the head - "from my mother's womb, You formed my head";</p>
<p class="bas indent2"><span class="nm">2.</span>Aba Sha'ul says, it is from the navel. It grows in all directions.</p>
<p class="bas indent1"><span class="nm">(r)</span><span class="cl">Rejection:</span> No. Aba Sha'ul can hold even like R. Akiva;</p>
<p class="bas indent2"><span class="nm">1.</span>Aba Sha'ul said that a fetus is created from the middle, but he can admit that the source of life is the nose - "all that has a soul of life in its nose."</p>
<p class="bas indent1"><span class="nm">(s)</span>R. Eliezer ben Yakov says, we measure from where he became a corpse, from the neck.</p>
<p class="bas indent2"><span class="nm">1.</span>He learns from a verse that cutting the neck makes it called a corpse.</p>
<p class="bas subject"><span class="nm">5)</span>THE BEHEADING</p>
<p class="bas indent1"><span class="nm">(a)</span><span class="cl">(Mishnah):</span> (After measuring), the judges from Yerushalayim return to Yerushalayim. The elders of the nearest city bring a calf that never bore a yoke.</p>
<p class="bas indent1"><span class="nm">(b)</span>A Mum (blemish) does not disqualify the calf.</p>
<p class="bas indent1"><span class="nm">(c)</span><span class="cl">Version #1 (Rashi):</span> They take it down to an Eisan valley. This means hard. Even if it is not hard, it is Kosher.</p>
<p class="bas indent1"><span class="nm">(d)</span><span class="cl">Version #2 (Rambam):</span> They take it down to an Eisan (raging; alternatively, old) river. It should be Eisan. Even if it is not Eisan, it is Kosher. (end of Version #2)</p>
<p class="bas indent1"><span class="nm">(e)</span>They behead it with a chopping knife from the back. One may not farm the place where it was beheaded. One may comb flax there or quarry rocks.</p>
<p class="bas indent1"><span class="nm">(f)</span>The elders of the city wash their hands in water where it was beheaded. They say "our hands did not spill his blood, and our eyes did not see."</p>
<p class="bas indent2"><span class="nm">1.</span><span class="cl">Question:</span> Would we really think that the elders of Beis Din are murderers?!</p>
<p class="bas indent2"><span class="nm">2.</span><span class="cl">Answer:</span> They mean, had he come to us, we would not have turned him away; had we seen him, we would not have abandoned him.</p>
