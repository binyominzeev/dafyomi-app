<p class="bas subject"><span class="nm">1)</span>COVERS AND BOLTS</p>
<p class="bas indent1"><span class="nm">(a)</span><span class="cl">(Mishnah - Chachamim):</span> In either case one may use it to close.</p>
<p class="bas indent1"><span class="nm">(b)</span><span class="cl">Question:</span> What does it mean 'in either case'?</p>
<p class="bas indent1"><span class="nm">(c)</span><span class="cl">Answer (R. Aba):</span> It means, whether or not it is tied - but it must be prepared from before Shabbos.</p>
<p class="bas indent1"><span class="nm">(d)</span><span class="cl">Question (R. Yirmiyah):</span> You should say 'whether or not it hangs - but it must be tied'!</p>
<p class="bas indent2"><span class="nm">1.</span><span class="cl">(Rabah bar bar Chanah):</span> They argue here just like they argue about a dragging bolt (this will be defined).</p>
<p class="bas indent2"><span class="nm">2.</span><span class="cl">(Mishnah):</span> One may use a dragging bolt to lock in the Mikdash, but not outside the Mikdash;</p>
<p class="bas indent2"><span class="nm">3.</span>If it is [not tied, rather,] resting [on the ground] it is forbidden everywhere.</p>
<p class="bas indent2"><span class="nm">4.</span>R. Yehudah says, if it is resting it is permitted in the Mikdash, if it drags it is permitted [even] outside the Mikdash.</p>
<p class="bas indent2"><span class="nm">5.</span><span class="cl">(Beraisa) Question:</span> What is the 'dragging' bolt permitted in the Mikdash and forbidden outside?</p>
<p class="bas indent2"><span class="nm">6.</span><span class="cl">Answer #1:</span> It is tied to the wall, hangs down and reaches the ground.</p>
<p class="bas indent2"><span class="nm">7.</span>R. Yehudah says this is permitted even outside the Mikdash!</p>
<p class="bas indent2"><span class="nm">8.</span><span class="cl">Answer #2 (R. Yehudah):</span> The bolt permitted only in the Mikdash is neither tied nor hanging; one removes it and leaves it in a corner.</p>
<p class="bas indent2"><span class="nm">9.</span><span class="cl">(R. Yehoshua bar Aba):</span> The Tana of Answer #1 is R. Eliezer [in our Mishnah - it follows that Chachamim of our Mishnah hold like R. Yehudah, who requires it to be tied to permit outside the Mikdash].</p>
<p class="bas indent1"><span class="nm">(e)</span><span class="cl">Answer (R. Aba):</span> I hold like the following Tana:</p>
<p class="bas indent2"><span class="nm">1.</span><span class="cl">(Beraisa):</span> If a commoner designated a stick to use to open and to lock, he may do so [on Shabbos] only if it is tied and hanging;</p>
<p class="bas indent2"><span class="nm">2.</span>R. Shimon ben Gamliel says, if it is prepared [it is permitted], even if it is not tied and hanging.</p>
<p class="bas indent1"><span class="nm">(f)</span><span class="cl">(Rav Yehudah bar Shilas citing R. Yochanan):</span> The Halachah follows R. Shimon ben Gamliel.</p>
<p class="bas subject"><span class="nm">2)</span>MOVING COVERS ON SHABBOS</p>
<p class="bas indent1"><span class="nm">(a)</span><span class="cl">Question:</span> R. Yochanan contradicts himself!</p>
<p class="bas indent2"><span class="nm">1.</span><span class="cl">(Mishnah):</span> Any cover that has a handle may be moved on Shabbos.</p>
<p class="bas bbbline">126b----------------------------------------126b</p>
<p class="bas indent2"><span class="nm">2.</span><span class="cl">(Rav Yehudah bar Shilas citing R. Yochanan):</span> This is only if it is like a Kli (Rashi - it is fit for use by itself; Tosfos - it was prepared for use).</p>
<p class="bas indent2"><span class="nm">3.</span><span class="cl">Suggestion:</span> Perhaps R. Shimon ben Gamliel also requires the bolt to be like a Kli!</p>
<p class="bas indent2"><span class="nm">4.</span><span class="cl">Rejection (Beraisa):</span> If one cut Chariyos (hard, leafless Lulav branches) for the sake of [fire] wood, and then decided to use them to sit on, he must tie them;</p>
<p class="bas indent2"><span class="nm">5.</span>R. Shimon ben Gamliel says, he need not tie them.</p>
<p class="bas indent1"><span class="nm">(b)</span><span class="cl">Answer:</span> R. Yochanan holds like R. Shimon ben Gamliel in one respect (if it is prepared, it need not be tied or hanging), he argues with him regarding whether or not it must be like a Kli.</p>
<p class="bas indent1"><span class="nm">(c)</span><span class="cl">(R. Yitzchak Nafcha):</span> The Halachah follows R. Eliezer (who requires that it be tied).</p>
<p class="bas indent1"><span class="nm">(d)</span><span class="cl">Question (Rav Amram - Mishnah):</span> From their words (an episode in the days of R. Tzadok's father) we learn that one may close [a window with something that is not tied and hanging], measure [a Mikvah or rag] and tie [a non-permanent knot] on Shabbos.</p>
<p class="bas indent1"><span class="nm">(e)</span><span class="cl">Counter-question (Abaye):</span> Do you ask because that is a Stam Mishnah [like Chachamim]? There is also a Stam Mishnah like R. Eliezer, that of the bolt (Amud A)!</p>
<p class="bas indent1"><span class="nm">(f)</span><span class="cl">Answer (Rav Amram):</span> My Stam is preferable, because an act was done [to be lenient, they must have been sure that this is the Halachah].</p>
<p class="bas indent1"><span class="nm">(g)</span><span class="cl">(Mishnah):</span> Any cover of a Kli that has a handle may be moved on Shabbos.</p>
<p class="bas indent1"><span class="nm">(h)</span>R. Yosi says, this applies to a cover of land [e.g. a pit] - covers of Kelim may be moved in any case.</p>
<p class="bas indent1"><span class="nm">(i)</span><span class="cl">(Gemara - Rav Yehudah bar Shilas):</span> This is only if it is like a Kli.</p>
<p class="bas indent1"><span class="nm">(j)</span>All agree that a cover of land may be moved only if it has a handle handle (otherwise, it is like building);</p>
<p class="bas indent1"><span class="nm">(k)</span>All agree that covers of Kelim may be moved even if they have no handle;</p>
<p class="bas indent1"><span class="nm">(l)</span><span class="cl">Version #1:</span> They argue about Kelim that were attached to the ground - the first Tana decrees on account of covers of land, R. Yosi does not decree.</p>
<p class="bas indent1"><span class="nm">(m)</span><span class="cl">Version #2:</span> They argue about covers of ovens - the first Tana considers them like covers of land, R. Yosi considers them like covers of Kelim.</p>

<p class="bas subject"><span class="nm">3)</span>MOVING FOOD TO MAKE ROOM TO SIT ON SHABBOS</p>
<p class="bas indent1"><span class="nm">(a)</span><span class="cl">(Mishnah):</span> We may clear out even four or five boxes of straw or grain, to make room for guests or Talmidim in the Beis Medrash, but one may not clear out a storehouse;</p>
<p class="bas indent1"><span class="nm">(b)</span>We may clear out Tahor Terumah, Demai (doubtfully tithed produce), Ma'aser Rishon from which Terumah was taken, Ma'aser Sheni and Hekdesh that were redeemed and dry lupines, for goats [alternatively - poor people] eat it;</p>
<p class="bas indent1"><span class="nm">(c)</span>We may not clear out Tevel, Ma'aser Rishon from which Terumah was not taken, Ma'aser Sheni and Hekdesh that were not redeemed, Luf (arum, a type of legume) or mustard;</p>
<p class="bas indent1"><span class="nm">(d)</span>R. Shimon ben Gamliel permits Luf, for ravens eat it;</p>
<p class="bas indent1"><span class="nm">(e)</span>If bundles of straw, wood and soft pruned reeds were prepared for animals to eat, one may move them; if not, not.</p>
<p class="bas indent1"><span class="nm">(f)</span><span class="cl">(Gemara) Question:</span> If we may clear out five boxes, there is no need to say that four are permitted!</p>
<p class="bas indent1"><span class="nm">(g)</span><span class="cl">Answer #1 (Rav Chisda):</span> We may clear out four out of five boxes (but not everything), or five out of a big storehouse.</p>
<p class="bas indent1"><span class="nm">(h)</span><span class="cl">Question:</span> What does it mean 'but one may not clear out a storehouse'? (The Reisha forbids totally clearing it out!)</p>
<p class="bas indent1"><span class="nm">(i)</span><span class="cl">Answer:</span> One may not begin to clear out a storehouse [because the contents are Muktzeh];</p>
<p class="bas indent2"><span class="nm">1.</span>This is like R. Yehudah, who forbids Muktzeh.</p>
