<div class="subject"><span class="nm">1)</span><p>CONCERN FOR HAUGHTINESS</p></div>
<div class="indent1"><span class="nm">(a)</span><p><span class="cl">(Mishnah):</span> In every place, Chachamim [do not work; R. Shimon ben Gamliel says, everyone should conduct himself like a Chacham].</p></div>
<div class="indent1"><span class="nm">(b)</span><p><span class="cl">Inference:</span> R. Shimon ben Gamliel is not concerned for haughtiness, and Chachamim are concerned.</p></div>
<div class="indent1"><span class="nm">(c)</span><p><span class="cl">Question:</span> Both Chachamim and R. Shimon contradict themselves!</p></div>
<div class="indent2"><span class="nm">1.</span><p><span class="cl">(Mishnah):</span> If a Chasan wants to say Shma on the first night, he may;</p></div>
<div class="indent2"><span class="nm">2.</span><p>R. Shimon ben Gamliel says, not everyone is fitting to flaunt his piety [that he fears Hash-m so much that he cannot miss Kabalas Ol Malchus Shomayim for one night].</p></div>
<div class="indent1"><span class="nm">(d)</span><p><span class="cl">Answer #1 (R. Yochanan):</span> The opinions [in one of these Mishnayos] must be switched.</p></div>
<div class="indent1"><span class="nm">(e)</span><p><span class="cl">Answer #2 (Rav Shisha brei d'Rav Idi):</span> The opinions need not be switched:</p></div>
<div class="indent2"><span class="nm">1.</span><p><span class="cl">Answer - part 1:</span> Regarding Tish'ah b'Av, since all others are working [except for Chachamim], it is haughtiness [for an Am ha'Aretz] not to work;</p></div>
<div class="indent3"><span class="nm">i.</span><p>Chachamim are not concerned for haughtiness regarding Kri'as Shma, for the Chasan acts like everyone else [who say it that night];</p></div>
<div class="indent2"><span class="nm">2.</span><p><span class="cl">Answer - part 2:</span> R. Shimon ben Gamliel is concerned for haughtiness regarding Kri'as Shma - since it requires intent, one who says it flaunts his ability to concentrate, but we know that a Chasan cannot! (Today, the Halachah is that a Chasan should say Shma - omitting Shma would show that he normally has proper intent!)</p></div>
<div class="indent3"><span class="nm">i.</span><p>Regarding Tish'ah b'Av, not working does not show that he considers himself to be a Chacham - rather, it looks like he has no work to do, like so many other people!</p></div>
<div class="subject"><span class="nm">2)</span><p>IS MELACHAH FORBIDDEN ON EREV PESACH?</p></div>
<div class="indent1"><span class="nm">(a)</span><p><span class="cl">(Mishnah - Chachamim):</span> In Yehudah, people would do Melachah on Erev Pesach until midday; in Galil, they would not do Melachah at all.</p></div>
<div class="indent1"><span class="nm">(b)</span><p>Beis Shamai say, it is forbidden to do Melachah the night before;</p></div>
<div class="indent1"><span class="nm">(c)</span><p>Beis Hillel permit until sunrise.</p></div>
<div class="indent1"><span class="nm">(d)</span><p><span class="cl">(Gemara) Question:</span> The Tana first says that it is only a custom [to refrain from work] - and then he discusses when it is forbidden [everywhere]!</p></div>
<div class="indent1"><span class="nm">(e)</span><p><span class="cl">Answer (R. Yochanan):</span> The first Tana is R. Meir and the latter Tana is R. Yehudah:</p></div>
<div class="indent2"><span class="nm">1.</span><p><span class="cl">(Beraisa - R. Yehudah):</span> In Yehudah, people used to do Melachah on Erev Pesach until midday; in Galil, they would not do at all.</p></div>
<div class="indent2"><span class="nm">2.</span><p><span class="cl">R. Meir:</span> It does not depend on Yehudah and Galil - rather, where the custom is to work, one may work; where the custom is not to work, one may not work.</p></div>
<div class="indent2"><span class="nm">3.</span><p><span class="cl">Inference:</span> R. Meir says that it was a custom to work or not to work - this implies that R. Yehudah holds that [in a place where people do not] it is forbidden!</p></div>
<div class="indent1"><span class="nm">(f)</span><p><span class="cl">Question:</span> Here, R. Yehudah permits working on the 14th [in Yehudah] - elsewhere he forbids!</p></div>
<div class="indent2"><span class="nm">1.</span><p><span class="cl">(Beraisa - R. Yehudah):</span> If one was weeding [other plants from amidst grain] on the 13th, and he uprooted a sheave, he should replant it in mud [so it will take root right away and the Omer will permit it], but not in a dry place [for then it will be forbidden until the Omer the following year.</p></div>
<div class="indent2"><span class="nm">2.</span><p><span class="cl">Inference:</span> This applies on the 13th, but not on the 14th.</p></div>
<div class="indent2"><span class="nm">3.</span><p>We know that R. Yehudah holds that any grafting [or replanting] which is not absorbed within three days will never be absorbed;</p></div>
<div class="indent3"><span class="nm">i.</span><p>If he permitted work on the 14th, he should have taught about the 14th - there would be three days for it to take root - the [end of the] 14th, 15th and beginning of the 16th!</p></div>
<div class="indent1"><span class="nm">(g)</span><p><span class="cl">Answer #1 (Rava):</span> The Beraisa discusses Galil [where Melachah is forbidden on the 14th].</p></div>
<div class="indent1"><span class="nm">(h)</span><p><span class="cl">Question:</span> Even in Galil, Melachah is permitted the previous night (R. Yehudah should teach about weeding that night)!</p></div>
<div class="indent1"><span class="nm">(i)</span><p><span class="cl">Answer #1 (Rav Sheshes):</span> R. Yehudah holds like Beis Shamai [who forbid the previous night. In R. Yehudah's time the Halachah was already fixed like Beis Hillel - he must hold that [even] Beis Hillel forbid the previous night, unlike the Seifa of our Mishnah, which is R. Meir's opinion.]</p></div>
<div class="indent1"><span class="nm">(j)</span><p><span class="cl">Answer #2 (Rav Ashi):</span> He is even like Beis Hillel - he does not teach about weeding at night, for it is not normally done.</p></div>
<div class="indent1"><span class="nm">(k)</span><p><span class="cl">Answer #2 (to Question (f) - Ravina):</span> Really, he discusses Yehudah - he did not teach about the 14th because there would not be enough time for it to take root;</p></div>
<div class="indent2"><span class="nm">1.</span><p>He requires three days - one of these days can be a partial day, but the other two must be full days.</p></div>
<div class="subject"><span class="nm">3)</span><p>WHICH MELACHOS MAY START AND FINISH ON THE 14TH?</p></div>
<div class="indent1"><span class="nm">(a)</span><p><span class="cl">(Mishnah - R. Meir):</span> If one started any Melachah before the 14th he may finish it on the 14th;</p></div>
<div class="indent1"><span class="nm">(b)</span><p>One may not start a Melachah on the 14th even if he could finish it the same day.</p></div>
<div class="indent1"><span class="nm">(c)</span><p>Chachamim say, three kinds of craftsmen may work on the 14th until midday - tailors, barbers and launderers.</p></div>
<div class="indent1"><span class="nm">(d)</span><p>R. Yosi bar Yehudah permits also shoemakers.</p></div>
<div class="indent1"><span class="nm">(e)</span><p><span class="cl">(Gemara) Question:</span> Does the Mishnah discuss working for the sake of the festival, but one may not even finish something not for the sake of the festival;</p></div>
<div class="indent2"><span class="nm">1.</span><p>Or, does it discuss not for the festival, but one may even begin something for the sake of the festival?</p></div>
<div class="indent2"><span class="nm">2.</span><p>Or, perhaps in either case one may finish, but he may not begin?</p></div>
<div class="indent1"><span class="nm">(f)</span><p><span class="cl">Answer #1 (Beraisa):</span> One may not start on the 14th, even a small belt or cap.</p></div>
<div class="indent2"><span class="nm">1.</span><p><span class="cl">Suggestion:</span> It says '<i>even</i> a small belt or cap', i.e. even though they are for the festival, one may finish, but he may not begin - but one may not even finish something not for the festival!</p></div>
<div class="indent1"><span class="nm">(g)</span><p><span class="cl">Rejection:</span> No - really, one may finish something even if it is not for the festival;</p></div>
<div class="indent2"><span class="nm">1.</span><p>It means, even though these are small, and one might have thought that starting them is like finishing them, and one may even begin - the Beraisa teaches that this is not so.</p></div>
<div class="indent1"><span class="nm">(h)</span><p><span class="cl">Answer #2 (Beraisa - R. Meir):</span> One may finish any Melachah for the sake of the festival.</p></div>
<div class="bbbline">55b----------------------------------------55b</p></div>
<div class="indent2"><span class="nm">1.</span><p>This is if he began before the 14th - but if he did not begin before, he may not begin on the 14th, even a small belt or cap.</p></div>
<div class="indent2"><span class="nm">2.</span><p><span class="cl">Inference:</span> One may finish for the sake of the festival - but if it is not for the festival he may not even finish!</p></div>
<div class="indent1"><span class="nm">(i)</span><p><span class="cl">Rejection:</span> No - even if it is not for the festival he may finish; the Beraisa teaches that even for the festival it is permitted only to finish, but not to begin.</p></div>
<div class="indent1"><span class="nm">(j)</span><p><span class="cl">Answer #3 (Beraisa - R. Meir):</span> On the 14th one may finish any Melachah for the sake of the festival; if it is not for the festival it is forbidden;</p></div>
<div class="indent2"><span class="nm">1.</span><p>[Finishing] Melachah is permitted on Erev Pesach until midday in a place where this is the custom.</p></div>
<div class="indent2"><span class="nm">2.</span><p><span class="cl">Inference:</span> In a place where this is not the custom, even finishing for the sake of the festival is forbidden!</p></div>
<div class="indent1"><span class="nm">(k)</span><p><span class="cl">Conclusion:</span> The Mishnah permits [even to finish] only for the festival.</p></div>
<div class="indent1"><span class="nm">(l)</span><p><span class="cl">(Mishnah - Chachamim):</span> Three kinds of craftsmen...</p></div>
<div class="indent1"><span class="nm">(m)</span><p><span class="cl">(Beraisa):</span> Tailors are permitted because commoners may sew normally on Chol ha'Mo'ed (Erev Pesach is more lenient than Chol ha'Mo'ed);</p></div>
<div class="indent1"><span class="nm">(n)</span><p>Barbers and launderers and permitted, for one who came from overseas or was freed from prison may take haircuts and launder on Chol ha'Mo'ed;</p></div>
<div class="indent1"><span class="nm">(o)</span><p>R. Yosi bar Yehudah permits shoemakers, because those who come to Yerushalayim for the festival may fix their shoes on Chol ha'Mo'ed.</p></div>
<div class="indent1"><span class="nm">(p)</span><p><span class="cl">Question:</span> What do they argue about?</p></div>
<div class="indent1"><span class="nm">(q)</span><p><span class="cl">Answer:</span> The first Tana holds that we do not learn starting a Melachah from finishing it (we only permit things that one may start during Chol ha'Mo'ed); R. Yosi learns starting a Melachah from finishing it - since people may fix shoes [on Chol ha'Mo'ed], we may begin to make them [on Erev Pesach].</p></div>
<div class="subject"><span class="nm">4)</span><p>SEATING HENS ON EGGS</p></div>
<div class="indent1"><span class="nm">(a)</span><p><span class="cl">(Mishnah):</span> We may put eggs under hens [for them to sit on to hatch them] on the 14th;</p></div>
<div class="indent2"><span class="nm">1.</span><p>If a hen fled [from sitting on eggs], we may return it; if it died, we may replace it.</p></div>
<div class="indent1"><span class="nm">(b)</span><p>One may sweep under the legs of an animal on the 14th; on [Chol] ha'Mo'ed one may move it to the side [but may not totally remove it].</p></div>
<div class="indent1"><span class="nm">(c)</span><p>One may bring Kelim to a craftsman or take them back, even if they are not needed for the festival.</p></div>
<div class="indent1"><span class="nm">(d)</span><p><span class="cl">(Gemara) Question:</span> If one may put eggs under a hen, there is no need to say that we may return it (to avoid a loss, as we will explain)!</p></div>
<div class="indent1"><span class="nm">(e)</span><p><span class="cl">Answer (Abaye):</span> The Seifa permits returning it on Chol ha'Mo'ed [but one may not put new eggs under it then].</p></div>
<div class="indent1"><span class="nm">(f)</span><p><span class="cl">(Rav Huna):</span> One may return only within three days of its fleeing, for then the hen is still warm, and only if it already sat on the eggs for three days, for then [chicks started forming, if they will not finish the eggs will be useless,] it will be a total loss - but three days after it fled, or if it sat on the eggs less than three days, one may not return it.</p></div>
<div class="indent1"><span class="nm">(g)</span><p><span class="cl">(R. Ami):</span> One may return it even if it sat on the eggs less than three days.</p></div>
<div class="indent1"><span class="nm">(h)</span><p><span class="cl">Question:</span> What do they argue about?</p></div>
<div class="indent1"><span class="nm">(i)</span><p><span class="cl">Answer:</span> R.

<div class="subject"><span class="nm">5)</span><p>PERMITTED EXERTION ON THE 14TH AND CHOL HA'MO'ED</p></div>
<div class="indent1"><span class="nm">(a)</span><p><span class="cl">(Mishnah):</span> One may sweep under...</p></div>
<div class="indent1"><span class="nm">(b)</span><p><span class="cl">(Beraisa):</span> One may sweep waste in a Chatzer to the side; one may remove waste in a cattle pen or Chatzer to the wasteheap.</p></div>
<div class="indent1"><span class="nm">(c)</span><p><span class="cl">Objection:</span> The Beraisa contradicts itself regarding a Chatzer!</p></div>
<div class="indent1"><span class="nm">(d)</span><p><span class="cl">Answer #1 (Abaye):</span> On Chol ha'Mo'ed one may sweep [only] to the side; on the 14th one may remove it to the wasteheap.</p></div>
<div class="indent1"><span class="nm">(e)</span><p><span class="cl">Answer #2 (Rava):</span> The entire Beraisa discusses Chol ha'Mo'ed - the Seifa means, if the Chatzer has become like a cattle pen [it is full of waste, there is no place to sweep it], one may remove it to the wasteheap.</p></div>
<div class="indent1"><span class="nm">(f)</span><p><span class="cl">(Mishnah):</span> One may bring Kelim to a craftsman or take them back [even if they are not needed for the festival].</p></div>
<div class="indent1"><span class="nm">(g)</span><p><span class="cl">Contradiction (Rava - Beraisa #1):</span> One may not bring Kelim from a craftsman; if one fears lest they be stolen, he may clear them to another Chatzer [near the craftsman - he may not toil to take them to his house].</p></div>
<div class="indent1"><span class="nm">(h)</span><p><span class="cl">Answer #1 (Rav Papa and other Talmidim of Rava):</span> The Mishnah discusses the 14th; the Beraisa discusses Chol ha'Mo'ed.</p></div>
<div class="indent1"><span class="nm">(i)</span><p><span class="cl">Answer #2:</span> Both of them discuss Chol ha'Mo'ed - the Mishnah discusses one who suspects the craftsman [that he will sell them to someone else or deny that he was paid], the Beraisa discusses one who trusts him.</p></div>
<div class="indent1"><span class="nm">(j)</span><p><span class="cl">Support (Beraisa #2):</span> One may bring Kelim [needed for the festival] from a craftsman, such as a jug from a potter and a [glass] cup from a glassblower - but one may not bring [things not needed for the festival, such as] wool from a dyer or Kelim from a craftsman.</p></div>
<div class="indent2"><span class="nm">1.</span><p>If the craftsman lacks [money for] food, one may pay him and leave the Keli by him; if he distrusts him, he leaves it in a house nearby (this shows that we are lenient for one who distrusts him); if he fears lest they be stolen, he may take them home covertly.</p></div>
<div class="indent1"><span class="nm">(k)</span><p><span class="cl">Objection:</span> This only answers concerning returning, but not regarding bringing - [the Mishnah permits, and] the Beraisa forbids returning, all the more so it forbids bringing! (Distrust is no reason to permit bringing!)</p></div>
<div class="indent1"><span class="nm">(l)</span><p><span class="cl">Conclusion:</span> We must rely on Answer #1.</p></div>
<div class="subject"><span class="nm">6)</span><p>PRACTICES IN YERICHO</p></div>
<div class="indent1"><span class="nm">(a)</span><p><span class="cl">(Mishnah):</span> Six things were done [specifically] in Yericho; Chachamim protested only against three of them. They did not protest the following:</p></div>
<div class="indent2"><span class="nm">1.</span><p>They would Markiv (this will be explained) date trees the entire day [of Erev Pesach];</p></div>
<div class="indent2"><span class="nm">2.</span><p>They were Korech (wrapped together Kri'as) Shma (this will be explained);</p></div>
<div class="indent2"><span class="nm">3.</span><p>They [harvested and] made piles of <i>Chadash</i> (i.e. grain that took root after Pesach, before it is permitted by the Omer offering next Pesach. One may not harvest Chadash that is Kosher for the Omer. Rashi deletes 'harvested' from the text, since this is totally permitted - Yericho is a valley, hence its grain is Pasul for the Omer.)</p></div>
<div class="indent1"><span class="nm">(b)</span><p>Chachamim disapproved of three:</p></div>
<div class="indent2"><span class="nm">1.</span><p>They benefited from branches of [carob and sycamore] trees of Hekdesh;</p></div>
<div class="indent2"><span class="nm">2.</span><p>On Shabbos they ate dates under trees whose dates fall off;</p></div>
<div class="indent2"><span class="nm">3.</span><p>They left Pe'ah (a corner of the field which is not harvested - it is left for the poor) from Yerakos.</p></div>
