<p class="bas subject"><span class="nm">1)</span>BIRKAS KOHANIM</p>
<p class="bas indent1"><span class="nm">(a)</span><span class="cl">(Mishnah):</span> Birkas Kohanim outside the Mikdash is three Berachos. In the Mikdash, it is one Berachah;</p>
<p class="bas indent1"><span class="nm">(b)</span>In the Mikdash, Hash-m's name is pronounced like it is written (with Yud-Kei). Outside the Mikdash, a Kinuy (substitute name) is said (Aleph-Dalet);</p>
<p class="bas indent1"><span class="nm">(c)</span>Outside the Mikdash, the Kohanim lift their hands to shoulder height. In the Mikdash, they raise their hands above their heads, except for the Kohen Gadol, since he may not raise his hands above the Tzitz on his forehead;</p>
<p class="bas indent1"><span class="nm">(d)</span>R. Yehudah says, even the Kohen Gadol raises his hands above his head - "Aharon will lift his hands towards the people and bless them."</p>
<p class="bas indent1"><span class="nm">(e)</span><span class="cl">(Gemara - Beraisa):</span> "So you will bless" - in Hebrew.</p>
<p class="bas indent1"><span class="nm">(f)</span><span class="cl">Question:</span> What is the source of this? Perhaps they may bless in any language!</p>
<p class="bas indent1"><span class="nm">(g)</span><span class="cl">Answer #1:</span> We learn from a Gezeirah Shavah "bless-bless" from the Berachos on Har Gerizim, which were in Hebrew.</p>
<p class="bas indent1"><span class="nm">(h)</span><span class="cl">Answer #2 (R. Yehudah):</span> We need not learn from a Gezeirah Shavah. "So you will bless" - exactly like in the Torah, in Hebrew.</p>
<p class="bas indent1"><span class="nm">(i)</span><span class="cl">(Beraisa):</span> "So you will bless" - standing.</p>
<p class="bas indent1"><span class="nm">(j)</span><span class="cl">Question:</span> What is the source of this? Perhaps they may bless sitting!</p>
<p class="bas indent1"><span class="nm">(k)</span><span class="cl">Answer #1:</span> We learn from a Gezeirah Shavah "bless-bless" from the Berachos on Har Gerizim, which were said standing.</p>
<p class="bas indent1"><span class="nm">(l)</span><span class="cl">Answer #2 (R. Nasan):</span> We need not learn from a Gezeirah Shavah. It says "to serve (Hash-m), and to bless in His name" - just like Avodah in the Mikdash is done standing, also blessing.</p>
<p class="bas indent2"><span class="nm">1.</span><span class="cl">Question:</span> What is the source that Avodas ha'Mikdash is done standing?</p>
<p class="bas indent2"><span class="nm">2.</span><span class="cl">Answer:</span> It says "to stand and to serve."</p>
<p class="bas indent1"><span class="nm">(m)</span><span class="cl">(Beraisa):</span> "So you will bless" - with lifted hands.</p>
<p class="bas indent1"><span class="nm">(n)</span><span class="cl">Question:</span> What is the source of this? Perhaps they need not lift their hands!</p>
<p class="bas indent1"><span class="nm">(o)</span><span class="cl">Answer #1:</span> We learn from a Gezeirah Shavah. Here it says bless, just like "Aharon lifted his hands to the people and blessed them."</p>
<p class="bas indent2"><span class="nm">1.</span>Just like Aharon lifted his hands, also Birkas Kohanim is with lifted hands.</p>
<p class="bas indent1"><span class="nm">(p)</span><span class="cl">Objection (R. Yonasan):</span> If that is our source, we can learn only that the Kohen Gadol raises his hands, only on Rosh Chodesh, and only when offering a Korban of the Tzibur!</p>
<p class="bas indent1"><span class="nm">(q)</span><span class="cl">Answer #2 (R. Nasan):</span> We need not learn from a Gezeirah Shavah. "He (Aharon) and his children, for all days" equates Aharon's children to Aharon;</p>
<p class="bas indent2"><span class="nm">1.</span>Just like Aharon raised his hands, also his children raise their hands.</p>
<p class="bas indent2"><span class="nm">2.</span>It says "for all days" (not only Rosh Chodesh. Even though "he and his children" discusses Avodah, we learned that Berachah is equated to Avodas ha'Mikdash.</p>
<p class="bas indent1"><span class="nm">(r)</span><span class="cl">(Beraisa):</span> "So you will bless" - with Hash-m's actual name.</p>
<p class="bas indent1"><span class="nm">(s)</span><span class="cl">Question:</span> What is the source of this? Perhaps they bless with a Kinuy!</p>
<p class="bas indent1"><span class="nm">(t)</span><span class="cl">Answer:</span> "They will put My name" - My explicit name.</p>
<p class="bas indent2"><span class="nm">1.</span><span class="cl">Suggestion:</span> Perhaps His explicit name is used even outside the Mikdash!</p>
<p class="bas indent2"><span class="nm">2.</span><span class="cl">Rejection #1:</span> We learn from a Gezeirah Shavah from another verse that says "to put His name", which refers to the Beis ha'Mikdash.</p>
<p class="bas indent2"><span class="nm">3.</span><span class="cl">Rejection #2 (R. Yoshiyah):</span> We need not learn from a Gezeirah Shavah. It says "every place I will make My name mentioned, I will come to you and bless you."</p>
<p class="bas indent3"><span class="nm">i.</span><span class="cl">Objection:</span> This cannot be (that the Shechinah will be revealed wherever we bless, and that His explicit name may be mentioned anywhere)!</p>
<p class="bas indent3"><span class="nm">ii.</span><span class="cl">Answer:</span> The verse must be (understood) transposed - "every place I will come and bless you, I will make My name mentioned";</p>
<p class="bas indent3"><span class="nm">iii.</span>Hash-m will come to the Mikdash, and there His explicit name will be mentioned.</p>
<p class="bas subject"><span class="nm">2)</span>OTHER LAWS OF <i>BIRKAS KOHANIM</i></p>
<p class="bas indent1"><span class="nm">(a)</span><span class="cl">(Beraisa) Question:</span> "So you will bless Bnei Yisrael" - what is the source that they also bless converts, women and freed slaves?</p>
<p class="bas indent1"><span class="nm">(b)</span><span class="cl">Answer:</span> "Say to them" - to all of them.</p>
<p class="bas indent1"><span class="nm">(c)</span><span class="cl">(Beraisa):</span> "So you will bless" - face to face.</p>
<p class="bas indent1"><span class="nm">(d)</span><span class="cl">Question:</span> What is the source of this? Perhaps they can face their backs!</p>
<p class="bas indent1"><span class="nm">(e)</span><span class="cl">Answer:</span> "Say to them" - like a man speaking to his friend.</p>
<p class="bas indent1"><span class="nm">(f)</span><span class="cl">(Beraisa):</span> "So you will bless" - out loud.</p>
<p class="bas indent1"><span class="nm">(g)</span><span class="cl">Question:</span> What is the source of this? Perhaps they can whisper!</p>
<p class="bas indent1"><span class="nm">(h)</span><span class="cl">Answer:</span> "Say to them" - like a man speaking to his friend.</p>
<p class="bas indent1"><span class="nm">(i)</span><span class="cl">(Abaye):</span> If there are two (or more) Kohanim, one (Rashi - the Shali'ach Tzibur) calls to them "Kohanim." If there is only one Kohen, he is not called, for it says "say to them."</p>
<p class="bas indent1"><span class="nm">(j)</span><span class="cl">(Rav Chisda):</span> A Kohen calls the other Kohanim to bless. A Yisrael does not call the Kohanim to bless. "Say to them" - the calling is delegated to the Kohanim.</p>
<p class="bas bbbline">38b----------------------------------------38b</p>
<p class="bas indent2"><span class="nm">1.</span>The Halachah follows Abaye. The Halachah does not follow Rav Chisda.</p>
<p class="bas indent1"><span class="nm">(k)</span><span class="cl">(R. Yehoshua ben Levi):</span> "They will put My name on Bnei Yisrael, and I will bless them" - this shows that Hash-m desires Birkas Kohanim. (Maharsha - he expounds "I (Hash-m) will bless them (Yisrael)." Hash-m commanded that Kohanim also bless Yisrael, for He desires this.)</p>
<p class="bas indent1"><span class="nm">(l)</span><span class="cl">(R. Yehoshua ben Levi):</span> Any Kohen who blesses is blessed, and any Kohen who does not bless is not blessed - "I will bless those who bless you."</p>
<p class="bas indent1"><span class="nm">(m)</span><span class="cl">(R. Yehoshua ben Levi):</span> Any Kohen who does not give Birkas Kohanim transgresses three positive Mitzvos - "so you will bless", "say to them", and "they will put My name."</p>
<p class="bas indent2"><span class="nm">1.</span><span class="cl">(Rav):</span> We suspect that his mother was divorced or a Chalutzah (so he is disqualified from Kehunah).</p>
<p class="bas indent2"><span class="nm">2.</span>Rav does not argue with R. Yehoshua ben Levi. We suspect his lineage only if he never blesses.</p>
<p class="bas indent1"><span class="nm">(n)</span><span class="cl">(R. Yehoshua ben Levi):</span> Any Kohen who does not ascend (to the Duchan, where the Kohanim bless) during the Berachah of Retzeh (in the repetition of Shemoneh Esreh) may not bless - "Aharon lifted his hands to the people and blessed them, and descended from offering..."</p>
<p class="bas indent2"><span class="nm">1.</span>Just like there he blessed amidst Avodas ha'Mikdash, also Kohanim must ascend to bless during the Berachah of Avodas ha'Mikdash.</p>
<p class="bas indent1"><span class="nm">(o)</span><span class="cl">Objection:</span> R. Ami and R. Asi blessed, even though they did not ascend during Retzeh!</p>
<p class="bas indent1"><span class="nm">(p)</span><span class="cl">Answer:</span> They started walking during Retzeh, just they did not arrive until after Retzeh.</p>
<p class="bas indent1"><span class="nm">(q)</span><span class="cl">Support #1 (R. Oshaya):</span> The Kohen is forbidden to bless only if he did not even start walking during Retzeh.</p>
<p class="bas indent1"><span class="nm">(r)</span><span class="cl">Support #2 (Mishnah):</span> If a Shali'ach Tzibur is the only Kohen in the Beis ha'Keneses, if he is sure that he can bless and resume the repetition of Shemoneh Esreh, he may bless.</p>
<p class="bas indent2"><span class="nm">1.</span><span class="cl">Question:</span> He does not go (to the Duchan during Retzeh)!</p>
<p class="bas indent2"><span class="nm">2.</span><span class="cl">Answer:</span> It suffices that he moves a drop towards it.</p>
<p class="bas indent2"><span class="nm">3.</span>The same applies to R. Ami and R. Asi.</p>
<p class="bas subject"><span class="nm">3)</span>OTHER TEACHINGS OF R. YEHOSHUA BEN LEVI</p>
<p class="bas indent1"><span class="nm">(a)</span><span class="cl">(R. Yehoshua ben Levi):</span> We give the cup (to lead Birkas ha'Mazon) only to one with a good eye (i.e. he delights in the good fortune of others) - "one with a good eye Yevorach (will be blessed), for he gave from his bread to the poor."</p>
<p class="bas indent2"><span class="nm">1.</span>We read this Yevarech (he will bless).</p>
<p class="bas indent1"><span class="nm">(b)</span><span class="cl">(R. Yehoshua ben Levi):</span> Even birds recognize stingy people (and will not eat from them) - "for naught the trap is set in the eyes of all fowl." (Iyun Yakov - even though birds always eat 'stolen' food, they resent stingy people more than thieves, who steal due to hunger. Maharsha - birds do not recognize the nature of people. Hash-m causes that they not eat.</p>
<p class="bas indent1"><span class="nm">(c)</span><span class="cl">(R. Yehoshua ben Levi):</span> Anyone who benefits from a stingy person transgresses a Lav - "do not eat a stingy man's bread... it is bitter to his soul."</p>
<p class="bas indent1"><span class="nm">(d)</span><span class="cl">(Rav Nachman bar Yitzchak):</span> He transgresses two Lavim, "do not eat" and  (the continuation of the verse) "do not desire."</p>
<p class="bas indent1"><span class="nm">(e)</span><span class="cl">(R. Yehoshua ben Levi):</span> Eglah Arufah comes due to stingy people - "(the elders) say 'we did not spill this man's blood.'"</p>
<p class="bas indent2"><span class="nm">1.</span><span class="cl">Question:</span> Would we really suspect that the elders of Beis Din killed him?!</p>
<p class="bas indent2"><span class="nm">2.</span><span class="cl">Answer:</span> Rather, they mean 'don't think that he came to us and we turned him away' - without food;</p>
<p class="bas indent2"><span class="nm">3.</span>'Don't think that we saw him and left him' - without a group to travel with.</p>
<p class="bas subject"><span class="nm">4)</span>A TZIBUR OF KOHANIM</p>
<p class="bas indent1"><span class="nm">(a)</span><span class="cl">(Ada):</span> If only Kohanim are in the Beis ha'Keneses, they all bless Birkas Kohanim.</p>
<p class="bas indent1"><span class="nm">(b)</span><span class="cl">Question:</span> Whom do they bless?</p>
<p class="bas indent1"><span class="nm">(c)</span><span class="cl">Answer (R. Zeira):</span> They bless Yisre'elim in the fields.</p>
<p class="bas indent1"><span class="nm">(d)</span><span class="cl">Question #1:</span> Aba, the son of Rav Minyamin bar Chiya recited a Beraisa saying that people in back of the Kohanim are not blessed!</p>
<p class="bas indent1"><span class="nm">(e)</span><span class="cl">Answer:</span> Those who could have come to face the Kohanim are not blessed. Those who were unable to are blessed.</p>
<p class="bas indent1"><span class="nm">(f)</span><span class="cl">Question #2:</span> Rav Simi taught that if only Kohanim are in the Beis ha'Keneses, some bless and the others answer Amen!</p>
<p class="bas indent1"><span class="nm">(g)</span><span class="cl">Answer:</span> If we can leave 10 to answer, then others give the Berachah. If there are only 10 in all, all bless Birkas Kohanim.</p>
<p class="bas indent1"><span class="nm">(h)</span><span class="cl">(Aba's Beraisa):</span> People in back of the Kohanim are not blessed</p>
<p class="bas indent1"><span class="nm">(i)</span>The following two laws are obvious.</p>
<p class="bas indent2"><span class="nm">1.</span>A short person in back of a tall person is blessed.</p>
<p class="bas indent2"><span class="nm">2.</span>The Aron is not a barrier that inhibits those behind it from receiving the Berachah.</p>
<p class="bas indent1"><span class="nm">(j)</span><span class="cl">Question:</span> Does a (different) barrier block the Berachah?</p>
<p class="bas indent1"><span class="nm">(k)</span><span class="cl">Answer:</span> No. R. Yehoshua ben Levi taught that even an iron wall does not intervene between Yisrael and Hash-m.</p>
<p class="bas indent1"><span class="nm">(l)</span><span class="cl">Question:</span> Do people on the side receive the Berachah?</p>
<p class="bas indent1"><span class="nm">(m)</span><span class="cl">Answer (Aba Mar bar Rav Ashi - Mishnah):</span> If one intended to sprinkle (water on which ashes of the red heifer were put) on something in front of him, and it landed on something in back of him, or vice-versa, the sprinkling is invalid;</p>
<p class="bas indent2"><span class="nm">1.</span>If one intended to sprinkle in front, and it landed on something in front to the side, it is valid. (Similarly, people on the sides in front of the Kohanim receive the Berachah.)</p>
