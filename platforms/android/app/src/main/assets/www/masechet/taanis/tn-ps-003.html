<div class="subject"><span class="nm">1)</span><p>NISUCH HA'MAYIM</p></div>
<div class="indent1"><span class="nm">(a)</span><p><span class="cl">(R. Nosson):</span> The Pasuk of "Hasech Nesech" alludes to two Nisuchin, that of wine and that of water.</p></div>
<div class="indent2"><span class="nm">1.</span><p><span class="cl">Question:</span> Perhaps they both refer to that of wine?</p></div>
<div class="indent2"><span class="nm">2.</span><p><span class="cl">Question:</span> If so, it would use the identical term twice.</p></div>
<div class="indent1"><span class="nm">(b)</span><p><span class="cl">Question:</span> There is a Mishnah that speaks of Nisuch ha'Mayim taking place all seven days of Sukos - who does this follow?</p></div>
<div class="indent2"><span class="nm">1.</span><p>It cannot be R. Yehoshua, as he would hold that it was only done for one day.</p></div>
<div class="indent2"><span class="nm">2.</span><p>It cannot be R. Akiva, as he would hold that it was only done for two days.</p></div>
<div class="indent2"><span class="nm">3.</span><p>It cannot be R. Yehudah b. Beseirah, as he would hold that it was only done for six days.</p></div>
<div class="indent1"><span class="nm">(c)</span><p><span class="cl">Suggested answer:</span> It follows R. Yehudah b. Beseirah, and he follows R. Yehudah's view that that Nisuch ha'Mayim would take place all eight days; he follows it insofar as saying that it took place until the eighth day, but starting from the second, totalling seven days.</p></div>
<div class="indent2"><span class="nm">1.</span><p><span class="cl">Question:</span> But he discounts the first day because the MaYiM allusion begins on the second day - yet it finishes on the seventh day, so the Nisuch ha'Mayim should finish then!?</p></div>
<div class="indent1"><span class="nm">(d)</span><p><span class="cl">New answer:</span> The Mishnah follows R. Yehoshua, and it is a received Halachah that the Nisuch ha'Mayim takes place all seven days.</p></div>
<div class="indent2"><span class="nm">1.</span><p>The laws of ten scattered trees, Aravah, and Nisuch ha'Mayim, are Halachos le'Moshe mi'Sinai.</p></div>
<div class="subject"><span class="nm">2)</span><p>MENTIONING RAIN</p></div>
<div class="indent1"><span class="nm">(a)</span><p>R. Yehudah, citing R. Yehoshua, said that on the last day of Sukos, the Shali'ach Tzibur for Musaf mentions the rain, but not that of Shacharis; on the first day of Pesach, the Shali'ach Tzibur of Shacharis mentions the rain, but not that of Musaf.</p></div>
<div class="indent1"><span class="nm">(b)</span><p><span class="cl">Question:</span> Which R. Yehoshua is this?</p></div>
<div class="indent2"><span class="nm">1.</span><p>It cannot be R. Yehoshua of the Mishnah, as he said that even the Shali'ach Tzibur of Shacharis on the last day would mention the rain.</p></div>
<div class="indent2"><span class="nm">2.</span><p>It cannot be R. Yehoshua of the Beraisa, as he said that the rain is mentioned from when the Lulav is put away, which is on the seventh day, not Shemini Atzeres.</p></div>
<div class="indent1"><span class="nm">(c)</span><p><span class="cl">Question #2:</span>  Who is the ben Beseirah who is cited as saying that the rains are mentioned from the last day of Sukos?</p></div>
<div class="indent2"><span class="nm">1.</span><p>It cannot be R. Yehudah b. Beseirah, as he said that it is mentioned from the second day of Sukos!</p></div>
<div class="indent1"><span class="nm">(d)</span><p><span class="cl">Answer:</span> They both refer to R. Yehoshua b. Beseirah.</p></div>
<div class="indent2"><span class="nm">1.</span><p>He was referred to as b. Beseirah before he received Semichah, and as R. Yehoshua afterwards.</p></div>
<div class="subject"><span class="nm">3)</span><p>DEW AND WIND</p></div>
<div class="indent1"><span class="nm">(a)</span><p><span class="cl">(Beraisa):</span> There is no obligation to mention the dew and the wind, although he can if he so desires.</p></div>
<div class="indent1"><span class="nm">(b)</span><p><span class="cl">Question:</span> Why is there no need to mention them?</p></div>
<div class="indent1"><span class="nm">(c)</span><p><span class="cl">Answer:</span> Because they are never withheld.</p></div>
<div class="indent1"><span class="nm">(d)</span><p><span class="cl">Question:</span> How do we know that dew is never withheld?</p></div>
<div class="indent1"><span class="nm">(e)</span><p><span class="cl">Answer:</span> Eliyah ha'Navi, after swearing that rain and dew would be withheld from Achav, told him after it was revoked that the rain would return - but the dew was never withheld.</p></div>
<div class="bbbline">3b----------------------------------------3b</p></div>
<div class="indent2"><span class="nm">1.</span><p><span class="cl">Question:</span> Why, then, did Eliyahu swear that it would be withheld?</p></div>
<div class="indent2"><span class="nm">2.</span><p><span class="cl">Answer:</span> He meant that dew of blessing would be withheld.</p></div>
<div class="indent2"><span class="nm">3.</span><p><span class="cl">Question:</span> Why, then, did he not say that the dew of blessing would be returned?</p></div>
<div class="indent2"><span class="nm">4.</span><p><span class="cl">Answer:</span> As it wouldn't be noticeable.</p></div>
<div class="indent1"><span class="nm">(f)</span><p><span class="cl">Question:</span> How do we know that wind is never withheld?</p></div>
<div class="indent1"><span class="nm">(g)</span><p><span class="cl">Answer:</span> Hash-m says that He has spread out Israel "as the four Ruchos."</p></div>
<div class="indent1"><span class="nm">(h)</span><p>This cannot mean that He has made them live in all four directions, as it would say <i>in</i> the four Ruchos.</p></div>
<div class="indent1"><span class="nm">(i)</span><p>It must mean that just as the world cannot survive without wind, so too it cannot survive without Israel.</p></div>
<div class="indent2"><span class="nm">1.</span><p>Therefore, although if, in summer, he must start again if he mentioned the rain, he need not start again if he mentioned the wind.</p></div>
<div class="indent2"><span class="nm">2.</span><p>Similarly, although if, in winter, he must start again if he did not mention the rain, he need not start again if he did not mention the wind.</p></div>
<div class="indent2"><span class="nm">3.</span><p>Even if he were to say that Hash-m makes the wind and dew go away, he wouldn't have to start again.</p></div>
<div class="indent1"><span class="nm">(j)</span><p><span class="cl">(Beraisa):</span> He is not obligated to mention the clouds or the wind, although he can if he so desires.</p></div>
<div class="indent2"><span class="nm">1.</span><p>The reason that he need not mention them is that they are never withheld.</p></div>
<div class="indent1"><span class="nm">(k)</span><p><span class="cl">Question:</span> Surely, as a Beraisa notes, the Pasuk says that Hash-m will stop the clouds and wind!?</p></div>
<div class="indent1"><span class="nm">(l)</span><p><span class="cl">Answer:</span> Clouds before the rain are not withheld, those after it are; normal weak winds are not withheld, unusually strong ones are.</p></div>
<div class="indent2"><span class="nm">1.</span><p><span class="cl">Question:</span> Surely unusually strong winds are essential for winnowing?</p></div>
<div class="indent2"><span class="nm">2.</span><p><span class="cl">Answer:</span> It can be done with a sieve.</p></div>
<div class="subject"><span class="nm">4)</span><p>BENEFICIAL WEATHER</p></div>
<div class="indent1"><span class="nm">(a)</span><p><span class="cl">(Beraisa):</span> Clouds and wind are second in value to rain.</p></div>
<div class="indent2"><span class="nm">1.</span><p>This refers to when they occur after rainfall.</p></div>
<div class="indent2"><span class="nm">2.</span><p><span class="cl">Question:</span> This means that they are beneficial - but a Pasuk about a curse of the land turning to dust is explained to refer to wind after rain!</p></div>
<div class="indent2"><span class="nm">3.</span><p><span class="cl">Answer:</span> Soft rain is beneficial; hard rain followed by wind turns the ground to dust.</p></div>
<div class="indent1"><span class="nm">(b)</span><p><span class="cl">(R. Yehudah):</span> Wind and clouds after rain are as beneficial as rain; sunshine after rain is twice as beneficial.</p></div>
<div class="indent2"><span class="nm">1.</span><p>This excludes the glow after sunset and the sunshine between the clouds.</p></div>
<div class="indent1"><span class="nm">(c)</span><p><span class="cl">(Rava):</span> Snow is as beneficial to the mountains as five rainfalls for the land, as derived from a Pasuk.</p></div>
<div class="indent1"><span class="nm">(d)</span><p><span class="cl">(Rava):</span> Snow is good for the mountains, hard rain for the trees, soft rain for the fruits, and Urpila (a drizzling rain) helps even seeds under hard clods of earth.</p></div>
<div class="indent2"><span class="nm">1.</span><p>Urpila is an acronym for Uru Pili, "Wake up, you cracks!"</p></div>
<div class="indent1"><span class="nm">(e)</span><p><span class="cl">(Rava):</span> Young Torah scholars are like seeds under hard clods of earth; as soon as they begin to sprout, they grow quickly.</p></div>
