<p class="bas subject"><span class="nm">1)</span>WHO MAY CIRCUMCISE?</p>
<p class="bas indent1"><span class="nm">(a)</span><span class="cl">Answer #2:</span> Do not switch the opinions. The case is, the Mohel is a professional;</p>
<p class="bas indent2"><span class="nm">1.</span><span class="cl">(Rav Dimi):</span> A professional Nochri Mohel may circumcise a Yisrael (he is concerned for his reputation, so he will circumcise properly).</p>
<p class="bas indent1"><span class="nm">(b)</span><span class="cl">Objection:</span> Does R. Yehudah really permit using a Kusi Mohel?!</p>
<p class="bas indent2"><span class="nm">1.</span><span class="cl">(Beraisa - R. Yehudah):</span> A Yisrael may circumcise a Kusi.</p>
<p class="bas indent2"><span class="nm">2.</span>A Kusi may not circumcise a Yisrael, for they circumcise for the sake of Har Grizim (their idolatry);</p>
<p class="bas indent2"><span class="nm">3.</span><span class="cl">R. Yosi:</span> Circumcision need not be Lishmah (for the sake of the Mitzvah)!</p>
<p class="bas indent1"><span class="nm">(c)</span><span class="cl">Conclusion:</span> Really, the opinions must be switched;</p>
<p class="bas indent2"><span class="nm">1.</span>(This led to a contradiction in R. Yehudah's opinion. To resolve it,) we attribute Beraisa #1 to R. Yehudah ha'Nasi (Rebbi), for another Beraisa explicitly expounds this way in his name.</p>
<p class="bas indent2"><span class="nm">2.</span><span class="cl">(Beraisa - Rebbi):</span> Circumcision by a Nochri is invalid - "v'Atah Es Brisi Tishmor."</p>
<p class="bas indent1"><span class="nm">(d)</span><span class="cl">(Rav Chisda):</span> R. Yehudah learns that circumcision must be Lishmah from "la'Shem Himol";</p>
<p class="bas indent2"><span class="nm">1.</span>R. Yosi learns from "Himol Yimol" that circumcision is valid, even if it was not Lishmah.</p>
<p class="bas indent1"><span class="nm">(e)</span><span class="cl">Question:</span> What does R. Yosi learn from "la'Shem Himol"?</p>
<p class="bas indent1"><span class="nm">(f)</span><span class="cl">Answer:</span> The verse says "Pesach la'Shem Himol..." He explains that "la'Shem" refers to Korban Pesach, and teaches that it must be offered Lishmah.</p>
<p class="bas indent1"><span class="nm">(g)</span><span class="cl">Question:</span> What does R. Yehudah learn from "Himol Yimol"?</p>
<p class="bas indent1"><span class="nm">(h)</span>The Torah speaks the way people speak. (He does not expound the double expression.)</p>
<p class="bas indent1"><span class="nm">(i)</span><span class="cl">Question:</span> What is the source that circumcision by a Nochri is invalid?</p>
<p class="bas indent1"><span class="nm">(j)</span><span class="cl">Answer #1 (Daro bar Papa):</span> Hash-m told Avraham "v'Atah Es Brisi Tishmor (v'Zar'echa Acharecha)."</p>
<p class="bas indent1"><span class="nm">(k)</span><span class="cl">Answer #2 (R. Yochanan):</span> "Himol Yimol" (one who is circumcised may circumcise).</p>
<p class="bas indent1"><span class="nm">(l)</span><span class="cl">Question:</span> What is the difference between these answers?</p>
<p class="bas indent1"><span class="nm">(m)</span><span class="cl">Answer #1:</span> They argue about a circumcised Nochri (e.g. Gavnunim, a nation that circumcises. They were not commanded about circumcision).</p>
<p class="bas indent1"><span class="nm">(n)</span><span class="cl">Rejection (Mishnah):</span> If one vowed 'any benefit I get from uncircumcised people is Konam (forbidden like a Korban)', he may benefit from (even) uncircumcised Yisraelim. He may not benefit from (even) circumcised Nochrim.</p>
<p class="bas indent2"><span class="nm">1.</span>We learn that even circumcised Nochrim are considered uncircumcised!</p>
<p class="bas indent1"><span class="nm">(o)</span><span class="cl">Answer #2:</span> Rather, they argue about a Yisrael whose brothers died through circumcision (he is exempt from circumcision due to the danger, until we determine that it is no longer dangerous);</p>
<p class="bas indent2"><span class="nm">1.</span>He is commanded about circumcision, but he is uncircumcised.</p>
<p class="bas indent1"><span class="nm">(p)</span><span class="cl">Rejection (Mishnah):</span> If one vowed 'any benefit I get from circumcised people is Konam', he may not benefit from (even) uncircumcised Yisraelim, he may benefit from (even) circumcised Nochrim.</p>
<p class="bas indent2"><span class="nm">1.</span>We learn that even uncircumcised Yisraelim are considered circumcised!</p>
<p class="bas indent1"><span class="nm">(q)</span><span class="cl">Answer #3:</span> Rather, they argue about a Yisraelis;</p>
<p class="bas indent2"><span class="nm">1.</span>She is not commanded about circumcision, but she is considered circumcised.</p>
<p class="bas indent1"><span class="nm">(r)</span><span class="cl">Question:</span> Surely a woman may circumcise! "Va'Tikach Tziporah Tzor.."!</p>
<p class="bas indent1"><span class="nm">(s)</span><span class="cl">Answer #1:</span> We may read it 'va'Tukach' (she told someone else to take the rock and circumcise).</p>
<p class="bas indent2"><span class="nm">1.</span><span class="cl">Question:</span> It says "va'Tichros" (feminine)!</p>
<p class="bas indent2"><span class="nm">2.</span><span class="cl">Answer:</span> We may read it 'va'Tichras' - she had someone else cut.</p>
<p class="bas indent1"><span class="nm">(t)</span><span class="cl">Answer #2:</span> She started the circumcision, and Moshe finished it.</p>
<p class="bas subject"><span class="nm">2)</span>BEING HEALED BY NOCHRIM</p>
<p class="bas indent1"><span class="nm">(a)</span><span class="cl">(Mishnah):</span> One may use a Nochri for monetary cures (this will be explained), but not for cures of Nefashos (lives);</p>
<p class="bas indent1"><span class="nm">(b)</span>R. Meir says, one may not get a haircut from a Nochri in any place;</p>
<p class="bas indent1"><span class="nm">(c)</span>Chachamim permit this in a Reshus ha'Rabim, but not in private.</p>
<p class="bas indent1"><span class="nm">(d)</span><span class="cl">(Gemara) Question:</span> What are monetary cures, and what are cures of Nefashos?</p>
<p class="bas indent2"><span class="nm">1.</span><span class="cl">Suggestion:</span> Monetary cures are when the Nochri is paid. Cures of Nefashos are for free.</p>
<p class="bas indent2"><span class="nm">2.</span><span class="cl">Rejection:</span> If so, the Mishnah should say 'one may pay a Nochri to cure him, but he may not be cured by a Nochri for free'!</p>
<p class="bas indent1"><span class="nm">(e)</span><span class="cl">Answer #1:</span> Monetary cures are when there is no danger. Nefashos cures are when there is danger.</p>
<p class="bas indent1"><span class="nm">(f)</span><span class="cl">Question:</span> Rav Yehudah taught that we may not even use a Nochri to heal the wound after bloodletting (which is not dangerous)!</p>
<p class="bas indent1"><span class="nm">(g)</span><span class="cl">Answer #2:</span> Monetary cures are of the Yisrael's animal. Nefashos cures are of the Yisrael himself.</p>
<p class="bas indent2"><span class="nm">1.</span>According to this, we understand Rav Yehudah's law.</p>
<p class="bas indent1"><span class="nm">(h)</span><span class="cl">(Rav Chisda):</span> If a Nochri doctor says 'this drug will help you, but this one will harm you', one may rely on him.</p>
<p class="bas bbbline">27b----------------------------------------27b</p>
<p class="bas indent2"><span class="nm">1.</span>The Nochri assumes that the patient will ask others, too. (Since he did not ask the Nochri to heal him, he is testing him.) He does not want to ruin his reputation.</p>
<p class="bas indent1"><span class="nm">(i)</span><span class="cl">(R. Yochanan):</span> If a sick Yisrael might die, he may not be cured by a Nochri. If he surely will die (if not treated and no Yisrael can treat him), he may be cured by a Nochri.</p>
<p class="bas indent1"><span class="nm">(j)</span><span class="cl">Question:</span> Perhaps the Nochri will make him die quicker. We should try to preserve the short time he has to live!</p>
<p class="bas indent1"><span class="nm">(k)</span><span class="cl">Answer:</span> (If we have a chance to save his life) we are not concerned for (risking) the short time he has to live.</p>
<p class="bas indent1"><span class="nm">(l)</span><span class="cl">Question:</span> What is the source of this?</p>
<p class="bas indent1"><span class="nm">(m)</span><span class="cl">Answer:</span> "Ba'Ir va'Masnu... Fo va'Masnu... v'Nipelah El Machaneh Aram Im Yichayunu Nichyeh v'Im Yemisunu va'Masnu."</p>
<p class="bas indent2"><span class="nm">1.</span>Sincethey would die anyway, they were not concerned for a short time to live.</p>
<p class="bas subject"><span class="nm">3)</span>BEING HEALED BY MINIM</p>
<p class="bas indent1"><span class="nm">(a)</span><span class="cl">Question (Beraisa):</span> One may not talk at length with Minim, nor be cured by them, even if he has only a short time to live;</p>
<p class="bas indent2"><span class="nm">1.</span>Ben Dama, the nephew of R. Yishmael was bitten by a snake. Yakov of Sichniya (a Min) came to cure him. R. Yishmael would not let him.</p>
<p class="bas indent2"><span class="nm">2.</span><span class="cl">Ben Dama:</span> A verse proves that it is permitted!</p>
<p class="bas indent2"><span class="nm">3.</span>He died before giving his proof.</p>
<p class="bas indent2"><span class="nm">4.</span><span class="cl">R. Yishmael:</span> Happy are you! You died in Taharah, and you did not transgress Chachamim's words - "u'Poretz Gader (one who transgresses a Rabbinical decree) Yishechenu Nachash."</p>
<p class="bas indent1"><span class="nm">(b)</span><span class="cl">Answer:</span> We are more stringent about Minim, lest one be drawn to heresy.</p>
<p class="bas indent1"><span class="nm">(c)</span><span class="cl">Question:</span> He was going to die from a snakebite anyway. Had the Min cured him, even though he would be bitten by another snake, perhaps he would also be cured from that!</p>
<p class="bas indent1"><span class="nm">(d)</span><span class="cl">Answer:</span> There is no cure for one bitten for transgressing the words of Chachamim.</p>
<p class="bas indent1"><span class="nm">(e)</span><span class="cl">Question:</span> What proof did Ben Dama want to bring?</p>
<p class="bas indent1"><span class="nm">(f)</span><span class="cl">Answer:</span> "Va'Chai Bahem" - one should not die through observing the Mitzvos.</p>
<p class="bas indent2"><span class="nm">1.</span>R. Yishmael disagreed, for that does not apply in public.</p>
<p class="bas indent2"><span class="nm">2.</span><span class="cl">(Beraisa - R. Yishmael):</span> If one is threatened 'serve idolatry or be killed', he should transgress and live - "va'Chai Bahem", one should not die through observing the Mitzvos;</p>
<p class="bas indent2"><span class="nm">3.</span><span class="cl">Suggestion:</span> Perhaps that applies even in public (in front of 10 Yisraelim)!</p>
<p class="bas indent2"><span class="nm">4.</span><span class="cl">Rejection:</span> "V'Lo Sechalelu Es Shem Kodshi."</p>
