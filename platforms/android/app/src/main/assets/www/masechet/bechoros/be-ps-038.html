<div class="subject"><span class="nm">1)</span><p>TUM'OS OF DIFFERENT KELIM</p></div>
<div class="indent1"><span class="nm">(a)</span><p><span class="cl">Answer #1 (Rav Chisda):</span> Perhaps the Mishnah means 'a hole made by a big drill and Chisumo (an addition made by angling the drill to widen the hole).'</p></div>
<div class="indent1"><span class="nm">(b)</span><p><span class="cl">(Rav Tachlifa):</span> Do not say "perhaps". It definitely means this! You may rely on this like on the testimony of Chizkiyah, the father of Ikesh.</p></div>
<div class="indent2"><span class="nm">1.</span><p><span class="cl">(Beraisa):</span> Chizkiyah the father of Ikesh testified to the following law in front of R. Gamliel in Yavneh, in the name of the elder R. Gamliel:</p></div>
<div class="indent2"><span class="nm">2.</span><p>If a Kli Cheres (earthenware vessel) has no interior (it cannot hold anything), it does not have an inside and outside. If either side became Tamei, the entire Kli is Tamei. (Sometimes, only part of a Kli becomes Tamei, e.g. the inside or outside.)</p></div>
<div class="indent2"><span class="nm">3.</span><p><span class="cl">Objection:</span> The Torah teaches that Tum'ah of Klei Cheres depends on the inside. It can become Tamei only if it has an interior!</p></div>
<div class="indent2"><span class="nm">4.</span><p><span class="cl">Answer (R. Yitzchak bar Avin):</span> He means that if a Kli Shetef (a vessel that can become Tahor in a Mikveh, i.e. a wooden (Tosfos - or metal) Kli) is (structurally) like a Kli Cheres without an interior, the Kli Shetef does not have a (Halachic distinction between) inside and outside. I.e. if either part became Tamei, the entire Kli is Tamei.</p></div>
<div class="indent2"><span class="nm">5.</span><p><span class="cl">Question:</span> Why does it attribute the Tum'ah of Klei Shetef to Klei Cheres? It should say explicitly "if a Kli Shetef has no interior... !"</p></div>
<div class="indent2"><span class="nm">6.</span><p><span class="cl">Answer:</span> It teaches (by implication) that if a Kli Shetef has an interior, it is like a Kli Cheres. If the inside became Tamei, also the outside is Tamei. If the inside was not Nitma (even if Tum'ah touched the outside), even the outside is Tahor.</p></div>
<div class="indent2"><span class="nm">7.</span><p><span class="cl">Question:</span> Granted, the Torah taught that this is the law of Klei Cheres. It did not teach this about Kli Shetef!</p></div>
<div class="indent2"><span class="nm">8.</span><p><span class="cl">Answer:</span> Indeed, mid'Oraisa a Kli Shetef has no inside and outside regarding Tum'ah. The Beraisa refers to Tum'ah of liquids, which is mid'Rabanan;</p></div>
<div class="indent3"><span class="nm">i.</span><p><span class="cl">(Mishnah):</span> If a Tamei liquid touched the outside of a Kli, the outside is Tamei, and the inside, brim, and handles are Tehorim;</p></div>
<div class="indent3"><span class="nm">ii.</span><p>If a Tamei liquid touched the inside, the entire Kli is Tamei.</p></div>
<div class="indent2"><span class="nm">9.</span><p>Mid'Oraisa, food or drink cannot be Metamei a Kli. Chachamim decreed that liquids can be Metamei Kelim, due to fluids (such as urine and spit) of a Zav or Zavah, which can be Metamei Kelim;</p></div>
<div class="indent2"><span class="nm">10.</span><p>They decreed that liquids can be Metamei Klei Shetef as if they were Klei Cheres. This alerts people that the Tum'ah is only mid'Rabanan, so they will not burn Terumah or Kodshim due to it.</p></div>
<div class="indent2"><span class="nm">11.</span><p><span class="cl">Question:</span> If so, they should also make a distinction for Kelim with an interior for the same reason!</p></div>
<div class="indent2"><span class="nm">12.</span><p><span class="cl">Answer:</span> Since there is a distinction in Kelim without an interior, people know that Tum'ah of liquids is only mid'Rabanan.</p></div>
<div class="indent2"><span class="nm">13.</span><p><span class="cl">Question:</span> Does a Kli Shetef without an interior receive Tum'ah mid'Oraisa [so there was a need to decree about liquids]? We require that it resembles a sack, which is made to be moved empty and full!</p></div>
<div class="indent2"><span class="nm">14.</span><p><span class="cl">Answer:</span> Kelim proper for Midras (for people to sit or lie on are Mekabel Tum'ah mid'Oraisa even without an interior).</p></div>
<div class="indent2"><span class="nm">15.</span><p><span class="cl">Question:</span> If so, they should also decree about Medrasos of Klei Cheres!</p></div>
<div class="indent2"><span class="nm">16.</span><p><span class="cl">Answer:</span> Medras does not apply to Klei Cheres.</p></div>
<div class="subject"><span class="nm">2)</span><p>THE ARGUMENT OF BEIS HILLEL AND BEIS SHAMAI</p></div>
<div class="indent1"><span class="nm">(a)</span><p><span class="cl">Answer #2 (to Question 5:j on Daf 37b - Rav Papa):</span> Beis Hillel refer to a big drill, and Beis Shamai refer to a normal drill.</p></div>
<div class="indent1"><span class="nm">(b)</span><p><span class="cl">Inference:</span> Beis Shamai refer to a drill hole smaller than a Sela (that of Beis Hillel);</p></div>
<div class="indent1"><span class="nm">(c)</span><p><span class="cl">Objection #1:</span> We understand according to R. Meir (in the coming Mishnah), but not according to Chachamim!</p></div>
<div class="indent2"><span class="nm">1.</span><p><span class="cl">(Mishnah - R. Meir):</span> Beis Shamai refers to a small drill of surgeons;</p></div>
<div class="indent2"><span class="nm">2.</span><p>Chachamim say, they refer to a big drill for piercing walls.</p></div>
<div class="indent1"><span class="nm">(d)</span><p><span class="cl">Objection #2:</span> According to R. Meir, Beis Shamai is more lenient than Beis Hillel (a smaller hole is Metaher);</p></div>
<div class="indent2"><span class="nm">1.</span><p>If so, this Mishnah should be in Maseches Eduyos, which teaches <i>every</i> such argument. However, it is not!</p></div>
<div class="indent1"><span class="nm">(e)</span><p><span class="cl">Answer #3 (Rav Nachman):</span> A big drill is the size of a Sela Nironis. This (and even a small drill) is more than the size of a regular Sela (Beis Hillel's Shi'ur).</p></div>
<div class="subject"><span class="nm">3)</span><p>MUMIM OF THE EYE</p></div>
<div class="indent1"><span class="nm">(a)</span><p><span class="cl">(Mishnah):</span> The following are Mumim in the eye:</p></div>
<div class="indent2"><span class="nm">1.</span><p>The Ris (eyelid) was punctured, Chaser or cracked;</p></div>
<div class="indent2"><span class="nm">2.</span><p>There was in the eye Duk (film), Tavlul, Chalazon(,) Nachash or Etzev (many texts - Inav; these will be explained).</p></div>
<div class="indent2"><span class="nm">3.</span><p><span class="cl">Question:</span> What is Tavlul?</p></div>
<div class="indent2"><span class="nm">4.</span><p><span class="cl">Answer:</span> It is white (of the eye) that breaks through the iris and enters the black (pupil).</p></div>
<div class="bbbline">38b----------------------------------------38b</p></div>
<div class="indent1"><span class="nm">(b)</span><p><span class="cl">(Gemara) Question:</span> What is the Ris?</p></div>
<div class="indent1"><span class="nm">(c)</span><p><span class="cl">Answer (Rav Papa):</span> It is the eyelid.</p></div>
<div class="indent1"><span class="nm">(d)</span><p><span class="cl">(Mishnah):</span> Duk, Tavlul... (are Mumim).</p></div>
<div class="indent1"><span class="nm">(e)</span><p><span class="cl">(Beraisa #1):</span> A Duk (that appears) sunken into the eye is a Mum. A Duk (floating) on the surface is not a Mum.</p></div>
<div class="indent1"><span class="nm">(f)</span><p><span class="cl">Contradiction (Beraisa #2):</span> A sunken Duk is not a Mum. A Duk on the surface is a Mum.</p></div>
<div class="indent1"><span class="nm">(g)</span><p><span class="cl">Resolution:</span> One Beraisa discusses (a Duk in the) white, and the other discusses (a Duk in the) black.</p></div>
<div class="indent1"><span class="nm">(h)</span><p><span class="cl">Objection:</span> Mumim do not apply to the white!</p></div>
<div class="indent1"><span class="nm">(i)</span><p><span class="cl">Answer:</span> The resolution means that one Beraisa discusses a white Duk, and the other discusses a black Duk.</p></div>
<div class="indent2"><span class="nm">1.</span><p><span class="cl">(Rabah bar bar Chanah):</span> A sunken black Duk is a Mum. If it is on the surface, it is not a Mum;</p></div>
<div class="indent2"><span class="nm">2.</span><p>A sunken while Duk is not a Mum. If it is on the surface, it is a Mum.</p></div>
<div class="indent2"><span class="nm">3.</span><p>A Siman to remember these is Barka (a spot on the eye. It is white and floats; it is a Mum.)</p></div>
<div class="indent1"><span class="nm">(j)</span><p><span class="cl">(Mishnah):</span> Chalazon(,) Nachash or Etzev (Inav, are Mumim).</p></div>
<div class="indent1"><span class="nm">(k)</span><p><span class="cl">Question:</span> Are Chalazon and Nachash the same, or does it mean Chalazon <i>or</i> Nachash?</p></div>
<div class="indent1"><span class="nm">(l)</span><p><span class="cl">Answer (Rabah bar bar Chanah):</span> R. Yochanan ben Elazar once passed in front of R. Shimon ben Yosi ben Lekunya (the Gadol of his generation);</p></div>
<div class="indent2"><span class="nm">1.</span><p><span class="cl">R. Shimon:</span> Chalazon is a Mum Kavu'a. it is Nachash.</p></div>
<div class="indent2"><span class="nm">2.</span><p>Even though a Chacham may not rule about a Mum in his own animal, he may teach his Talmidim, and they may rule about it. (Now you may permit my Bechor.)</p></div>
<div class="indent1"><span class="nm">(m)</span><p><span class="cl">Question:</span> R. Aba taught that if a Chacham teaches a law that affects himself:</p></div>
<div class="indent2"><span class="nm">1.</span><p>If he already taught the law before it affected him, he may rely on his teaching;</p></div>
<div class="indent2"><span class="nm">2.</span><p>If he had not taught the law before it affected him, he may not rely on his teaching!</p></div>
<div class="indent1"><span class="nm">(n)</span><p><span class="cl">Answer:</span> R. Shimon had already taught this Mum before.</p></div>
<div class="indent1"><span class="nm">(o)</span><p><span class="cl">(Mishnah):</span> Tavlul is white that breaks through the iris...</p></div>
<div class="indent1"><span class="nm">(p)</span><p>Our Mishnah is like R. Yosi;</p></div>
<div class="indent2"><span class="nm">1.</span><p><span class="cl">(Beraisa - R. Meir):</span> If white enters the black, or if black enters the white, it is a Mum;</p></div>
<div class="indent2"><span class="nm">2.</span><p>R. Yosi says, the former is a Mum but not the latter, for Mumim do not apply to the white.</p></div>
<div class="indent1"><span class="nm">(q)</span><p><span class="cl">(Rav):</span> R. Yosi learns from "Yatza me'Chelev Einemo." (Tosfos - the eye bulges due to an excess of fat; Rashi - a Rasha begins his evil path amidst fatness of the eye, i.e. he desires what he sees);</p></div>
<div class="indent2"><span class="nm">1.</span><p>The white is called fat of the eye. It is not called the eye itself.</p></div>
<div class="indent1"><span class="nm">(r)</span><p>R. Meir holds that "Tavlul" refers to anything that is Mevalbel (interrupts) the eye.</p></div>
<div class="subject"><span class="nm">4)</span><p>OTHER MUMIM OF THE EYE</p></div>
<div class="indent1"><span class="nm">(a)</span><p><span class="cl">(Mishnah):</span> Chavarvar (white spots in the cornea) and (dripping) water are Mumim, if they are Kevu'im (permanent);</p></div>
<div class="indent1"><span class="nm">(b)</span><p>Chavarvar is considered Kavu'a if it persists for 80 days.</p></div>
<div class="indent1"><span class="nm">(c)</span><p>R. Chanina ben Antigonus says, we check it three times within 80 days.</p></div>
<div class="indent1"><span class="nm">(d)</span><p>Water is considered Kavu'a only if a special diet to cure it does not work;</p></div>
<div class="indent2"><span class="nm">1.</span><p>If the animal eats moist (i.e. winter fodder) and (then) dry (summer fodder) of (Beis ha'Ba'al, a field that subsists on) rain or of Beis ha'Shelachin (a field that must be irrigated), the Mum is not established (this is not the proper diet);</p></div>
<div class="indent2"><span class="nm">2.</span><p>It must eat moist <i>after</i> dry.</p></div>
<div class="indent1"><span class="nm">(e)</span><p><span class="cl">(Gemara):</span> Our Mishnah is like R. Yehudah:</p></div>
<div class="indent2"><span class="nm">1.</span><p><span class="cl">(Beraisa - R. Meir):</span> Chavarvar is considered Kavu'a after 40 days. Water is Kavu'a after 80 days;</p></div>
<div class="indent2"><span class="nm">2.</span><p>R. Yehudah says, Chavarvar is considered Kavu'a after 80 days.</p></div>
<div class="indent2"><span class="nm">3.</span><p>Eating dry and (then) moist of Beis ha'Shelachin, or moist and (then) dry, is not the proper diet;</p></div>
<div class="indent2"><span class="nm">4.</span><p>It must eat dry after moist (of Beis ha'Ba'al) for three months to establish the Mum.</p></div>
<div class="indent1"><span class="nm">(f)</span><p><span class="cl">Question:</span> Our Mishnah establishes a Mum after eating (moist, then dry) from either kind of field! (This is unlike R. Yehudah.)</p></div>
<div class="indent1"><span class="nm">(g)</span><p><span class="cl">Answer:</span> The Mishnah is abbreviated. It means as follows:</p></div>
<div class="indent2"><span class="nm">1.</span><p>Eating moist and dry of Beis ha'Ba'al establishes a Mum;</p></div>
<div class="indent2"><span class="nm">2.</span><p>Eating from Beis ha'Shelachin does not establish a Mum;</p></div>
<div class="indent2"><span class="nm">3.</span><p>Even Beis ha'Ba'al does not establish a Mum if it ate moist after dry;</p></div>
<div class="indent3"><span class="nm">i.</span><p>It must eat dry after moist for three months.</p></div>
<div class="indent1"><span class="nm">(h)</span><p><span class="cl">Question:</span> Rav Idi bar Avin taught that "moist" is during Adar and Nisan, and "dry" is during Elul and Tishrei (this implies that four months are required)!</p></div>
<div class="indent1"><span class="nm">(i)</span><p><span class="cl">Answer:</span> He means, Adar and half of Nisan are moist, Elul and half of Tishrei are dry.</p></div>
<div class="indent1"><span class="nm">(j)</span><p><span class="cl">Question:</span> Must it eat moist during the wet months and dry during the dry months, or may both be eaten during the wet months?</p></div>
<div class="indent1"><span class="nm">(k)</span><p><span class="cl">Answer:</span> Rav Idi bar Avin taught that "moist" refers to Adar and Nisan, and "dry" refers to Elul and Tishrei. (Each must be eaten in its proper time.)</p></div>
<div class="indent1"><span class="nm">(l)</span><p><span class="cl">Rejection:</span> Perhaps all may be eaten in the wet months, as long as the dry was cut during the dry months.	(Rashash asks why we do not ask about eating moist during the dry months. Perhaps it is impossible to keep fodder moist all summer.)</p></div>
