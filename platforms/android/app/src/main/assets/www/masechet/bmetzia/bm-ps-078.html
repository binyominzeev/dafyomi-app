<p class="bas subject"><span class="nm">1)</span>A SELLER ANXIOUS FOR THE MONEY (cont.)</p>
<p class="bas indent1"><span class="nm">(a)</span>Obviously, if Reuven was trying to sell land for 100, and was able to sell only a larger land for 200, and he shows anxiety for the money, the buyer does not acquire.</p>
<p class="bas indent1"><span class="nm">(b)</span><span class="cl">Question:</span> If Reuven was trying to sell land for 100, and had he tried harder, he could have sold it, but instead, he sold a land for 200, and shows anxiety for the money, what is the law?</p>
<p class="bas indent2"><span class="nm">1.</span>Is this like one who sells land due to its poor quality?</p>
<p class="bas indent2"><span class="nm">2.</span>This question is not resolved.</p>
<p class="bas subject"><span class="nm">2)</span>LIABILITY OF ONE WHO RETRACTS</p>
<p class="bas indent1"><span class="nm">(a)</span><span class="cl">(Mishnah):</span> If Reuven hired a donkey-driver or wagon-driver (who then retracted) ...he hires others for more or tricks them.</p>
<p class="bas indent1"><span class="nm">(b)</span><span class="cl">Question:</span> How much more may he pay others at the expense of the retractors?</p>
<p class="bas indent1"><span class="nm">(c)</span><span class="cl">Answer (Rav Nachman):</span> He may pay up to the wages (of what they already worked).</p>
<p class="bas indent1"><span class="nm">(d)</span><span class="cl">Question (Rava - Beraisa):</span> He may pay until 40 or 50 Zuz.</p>
<p class="bas indent1"><span class="nm">(e)</span><span class="cl">Answer (Rav Nachman):</span> That is when the workers left their work Kelim with the employer.</p>
<p class="bas subject"><span class="nm">3)</span>FULFILLING THE OWNER'S WILL</p>
<p class="bas indent1"><span class="nm">(a)</span><span class="cl">(Mishnah):</span> If Reuven rented Shimon's donkey to use it on the mountain, and he used it in the valley (or vice-versa) for the same distance and it died, he is liable;</p>
<p class="bas indent1"><span class="nm">(b)</span>If he rented it to use it on the mountain and he used it in the valley and it slipped, he is exempt. If it became overheated, he is liable;</p>
<p class="bas indent1"><span class="nm">(c)</span>If he rented it to use it in the valley and he used it on the mountain and it slipped, he is liable. If it became overheated, he is exempt;</p>
<p class="bas indent2"><span class="nm">1.</span>If it became overheated due to the ascent, he is liable.</p>
<p class="bas indent1"><span class="nm">(d)</span>If he rented a donkey and it Hivrikah (this will be explained) or was taken for the king's service, Shimon tells him, here is your animal (I need not supply you with another);</p>
<p class="bas indent2"><span class="nm">1.</span>If it died or became broken (broke a limb), Shimon must give him another donkey to use.</p>
<p class="bas indent1"><span class="nm">(e)</span><span class="cl">(Gemara) Question:</span> Why do we distinguish between slipping and overheating in the Seifa, but not in the Reisha?</p>
<p class="bas indent1"><span class="nm">(f)</span><span class="cl">Answer #1 (d'Vei R. Yanai):</span> In the Reisha it died because it was unaccustomed to the air (whether he switched to the mountain or valley he is liable).</p>
<p class="bas indent1"><span class="nm">(g)</span><span class="cl">Answer #2 (R. Yosi bar Chanina):</span> In the Reisha it died from exhaustion (Shimon can say, this would not have happened had you taken it in the proper place).</p>
<p class="bas indent1"><span class="nm">(h)</span><span class="cl">Answer #3 (Rabah):</span> In the Reisha a snake bit it.</p>
<p class="bas indent1"><span class="nm">(i)</span><span class="cl">Answer #4 (R. Chiya bar Aba):</span> The Mishnah is R. Meir, who says that anyone who transgresses the owner's wishes is a robber.</p>
<p class="bas bbbline">78b----------------------------------------78b</p>
<p class="bas indent1"><span class="nm">(j)</span><span class="cl">Question:</span> Where did R. Meir say this?</p>
<p class="bas indent1"><span class="nm">(k)</span><span class="cl">Answer #1 (Mishnah - R. Meir):</span> If a dyer was told to dye wool red, and he died it black, or vice-versa, he pays the value of the wool he received;</p>
<p class="bas indent2"><span class="nm">1.</span>R. Yehudah says, the owner pays the increased value or the dyer's expenses, whichever is smaller.</p>
<p class="bas indent1"><span class="nm">(l)</span><span class="cl">Rejection:</span> Perhaps R. Meir's reason is that the dyer acquires it through changing it!</p>
<p class="bas indent1"><span class="nm">(m)</span><span class="cl">Answer #2 (Beraisa):</span> Money collected (to give to the poor for the festive meal on Purim) must be given to the poor for Purim;</p>
<p class="bas indent2"><span class="nm">1.</span>Money collected for the poor of a city (Tosfos - for Purim) must be given to the poor of that city (some texts delete this clause). We are not concerned (Rashi - that this is too much for Purim, that some should be given for regular Tzedakah; Ritva - to check that the recipient is truly poor);</p>
<p class="bas indent2"><span class="nm">2.</span>We may slaughter calves for the poor to eat on Purim; the extra meat (is sold, the money) goes to Tzedakah.</p>
<p class="bas indent2"><span class="nm">3.</span>R. Eliezer says, the poor people must use Purim money for the Purim meal. They may not use it to buy a shoe strap without stipulating in front of the people of the city.</p>
<p class="bas indent2"><span class="nm">4.</span>This (Maharsha - the entire Beraisa until now) was said in the name of R. Meir. (Perhaps, since he intends for Tzedakah, the only reason to forbid is because one who deviates is a robber. The Ra'avad in Shitah Mekubetzes says so regarding the next case.)</p>
<p class="bas indent2"><span class="nm">5.</span>R. Shimon ben Gamliel is lenient (the money may be used for other things).</p>
<p class="bas indent1"><span class="nm">(n)</span><span class="cl">Rejection:</span> There, the people gave the money only for the Purim meal. It belongs to the giver until it is used for the meal!</p>
<p class="bas indent1"><span class="nm">(o)</span><span class="cl">Answer #3 (Beraisa - R. Meir):</span> If an Oni received money to buy a cloak, he may not use it for a different garment, for this deviates from the giver's intent.</p>
<p class="bas indent1"><span class="nm">(p)</span><span class="cl">Question:</span> Perhaps we are concerned lest the giver announced publicly that he will buy a cloak for the poor man, and they will suspect that he did not keep his promise.</p>
<p class="bas indent1"><span class="nm">(q)</span><span class="cl">Rejection:</span> If so, why does the Beraisa say 'for this deviates from the giver's intent'? It should say 'due to suspicion'!</p>
<p class="bas indent2"><span class="nm">1.</span>Rather, the reason is because one who deviates from the giver's intent is a robber.</p>
<p class="bas subject"><span class="nm">4)</span>WHEN MUST THE OWNER SUPPLY ANOTHER DONKEY?</p>
<p class="bas indent1"><span class="nm">(a)</span><span class="cl">(Mishnah):</span> If he rented a donkey and it Hivrikah...</p>
<p class="bas indent1"><span class="nm">(b)</span><span class="cl">Question:</span> What does Hivrikah mean?</p>
<p class="bas indent1"><span class="nm">(c)</span><span class="cl">Answer #1 (Chachamim of Bavel):</span> It is a speck in the eye.</p>
<p class="bas indent1"><span class="nm">(d)</span><span class="cl">Answer #2 (Rava):</span> Worms (Avzakah) corroded its legs.</p>
<p class="bas indent2"><span class="nm">1.</span>Some say that once a man was killed for saying that he saw moths in the king's linen garments. Moths eat woolen clothing, not linen.</p>
<p class="bas indent2"><span class="nm">2.</span>Some say that he actually said that it was in the woolen clothing, and he was spared.</p>
<p class="bas indent1"><span class="nm">(e)</span><span class="cl">(Mishnah):</span> If it was taken for the king's service, Shimon tells him, here is your animal.</p>
<p class="bas indent1"><span class="nm">(f)</span><span class="cl">(Rav):</span> This is only when the king returns the animals after using them. If not, Shimon must supply him with another donkey.</p>
<p class="bas indent1"><span class="nm">(g)</span><span class="cl">(Shmuel):</span> Whether or not the king returns them, if it was taken in the same direction that Reuven was going, Shimon can say 'here is your animal.' If it was not taken the way Reuven was going, Shimon must supply another.</p>
<p class="bas indent1"><span class="nm">(h)</span><span class="cl">Question (Beraisa):</span> If he rented a donkey and it Hivrikah or went crazy, Shimon can say 'the animal is in front of you.' If it died or was taken for the king's service, Shimon must supply another.</p>
<p class="bas indent2"><span class="nm">1.</span><span class="cl">Suggestion:</span> This is when it was not taken in the direction that Reuven was going.</p>
<p class="bas indent2"><span class="nm">2.</span><span class="cl">Rejection (Seifa - R. Shimon ben Elazar):</span> If it was taken in the same direction that Reuven was going, Shimon can say 'the animal is in front of you.' If not, Shimon must supply another.</p>
<p class="bas indent2"><span class="nm">3.</span><span class="cl">Inference:</span> The first Tana does not distinguish in which direction it was taken!</p>
<p class="bas indent1"><span class="nm">(i)</span><span class="cl">Answer #1:</span> Shmuel holds like R. Shimon ben Elazar.</p>
<p class="bas indent1"><span class="nm">(j)</span><span class="cl">Answer #2:</span> The entire Beraisa is R. Shimon ben Elazar. The Beraisa is abbreviated, it should say as follows:</p>
<p class="bas indent2"><span class="nm">1.</span>If Reuven rented a donkey and it Hivrikah or went crazy, Shimon can say 'here is your animal.' If it died or was taken for the king's service, Shimon must supply another;</p>
<p class="bas indent2"><span class="nm">2.</span>This is when it was not taken in the same direction that Reuven was going. If it was taken in the same direction, Shimon can say, here is your animal.</p>
<p class="bas indent2"><span class="nm">3.</span>This is R. Shimon ben Elazar's opinion, who says that Shimon must supply another if it was taken in a different direction.</p>
