<p class="bas subject"><span class="nm">1)</span>INHERITANCE FROM WOMEN</p>
<p class="bas indent1"><span class="nm">(a)</span><span class="cl">(Mishnah):</span> A man inherits his mother ...</p>
<p class="bas indent1"><span class="nm">(b)</span><span class="cl">Question:</span> What is the source of this?</p>
<p class="bas indent1"><span class="nm">(c)</span><span class="cl">Answer (Beraisa):</span> "V'Chol Bas Yoreshes Nachalah mi'Mat<i>os</i>..." - how can she inherit from two tribes? We must say that her parents are from different tribes, and she inherits both of them.</p>
<p class="bas indent2"><span class="nm">1.</span><span class="cl">Question:</span> How do we know that also a son inherits both parents?</p>
<p class="bas indent2"><span class="nm">2.</span><span class="cl">Answer:</span> A Kal v'Chomer teaches this;</p>
<p class="bas indent3"><span class="nm">i.</span>A daughter does not have precedence to inherit her father (over a son), yet she inherits her mother;</p>
<p class="bas indent3"><span class="nm">ii.</span>A son has precedence to inherit his father. All the more so, he inherits his mother!</p>
<p class="bas indent3"><span class="nm">iii.</span>Also, just like a son has precedence to inherit his father (over a daughter), also regarding his mother.</p>
<p class="bas indent2"><span class="nm">3.</span>R. Zecharyah ben ha'Katzov says, a son and daughter inherit their mother's property equally.</p>
<p class="bas indent3"><span class="nm">i.</span>He holds Dayo (a Kal va'Chomer may not teach more than either of the cases it is built on. Here, we have no source to say that the son has precedence to inherit the mother).</p>
<p class="bas indent1"><span class="nm">(d)</span><span class="cl">Question:</span> Do Chachamim really argue with Dayo? It is mid'Oraisa!</p>
<p class="bas indent2"><span class="nm">1.</span><span class="cl">(Beraisa):</span> "V'Aviha Yarok Yarak b'Faneha ha'Lo Sikalem Shiv'as Yamim" - all the more so, if Hash-m is angry at her, she should be isolated 14 days, but we learn only as much as the source.</p>
<p class="bas indent1"><span class="nm">(e)</span><span class="cl">Answer:</span> Usually, Chachamim agree to Dayo. Here they have a source to say that the son takes precedence also to inherit the mother.</p>
<p class="bas indent2"><span class="nm">1.</span>"Mi'Matos" equates the father's tribe to the mother's tribe.</p>
<p class="bas indent3"><span class="nm">i.</span>Just like the son has precedence to inherit the father, also to inherit the mother.</p>
<p class="bas indent1"><span class="nm">(f)</span>Rav Nitai was about to rule a case like R. Zecharyah ben ha'Katzav.</p>
<p class="bas indent2"><span class="nm">1.</span><span class="cl">Shmuel:</span> Will you rule like R. Zecharyah? The Halachah does not follow him!</p>
<p class="bas indent1"><span class="nm">(g)</span>R. Tavla ruled in a case like R. Zecharyah ben ha'Katzav.</p>
<p class="bas indent2"><span class="nm">1.</span><span class="cl">Rav Nachman:</span> Why did you rule this way?</p>
<p class="bas indent2"><span class="nm">2.</span><span class="cl">R. Tavla:</span> Rav Chinena bar Shalmiya said in the name of Rav that the Halachah follows R. Zecharyah.</p>
<p class="bas indent2"><span class="nm">3.</span><span class="cl">Rav Nachman:</span> Retract your ruling. If not, I will excommunicate you!</p>
<p class="bas indent1"><span class="nm">(h)</span>Rav Huna bar Chiya was about to rule a case like R. Zecharyah ben ha'Katzav.</p>
<p class="bas indent2"><span class="nm">1.</span><span class="cl">Rav Nachman:</span> Why will you rule like R. Zecharyah?</p>
<p class="bas indent2"><span class="nm">2.</span><span class="cl">Rav Huna bar Chiya:</span> Rav Huna said in the name of Rav that the Halachah follows R. Zecharyah.</p>
<p class="bas indent2"><span class="nm">3.</span><span class="cl">Rav Nachman:</span> I will send to inquire if Rav Huna really said so.</p>
<p class="bas indent3"><span class="nm">i.</span>Rav Huna bar Chiya was embarrassed. In the meantime, Rav Huna died.</p>
<p class="bas indent1"><span class="nm">(i)</span><span class="cl">Question:</span> Like whom does Rav Nachman hold?</p>
<p class="bas indent1"><span class="nm">(j)</span><span class="cl">Answer:</span> Rav and Shmuel taught that the Halachah does not follow R. Zecharyah.</p>
<p class="bas indent1"><span class="nm">(k)</span><span class="cl">Question (R. Yehudah Nesi'ah):</span> How do we know that the son has precedence to inherit the mother?</p>
<p class="bas indent1"><span class="nm">(l)</span><span class="cl">Answer (R. Yanai):</span> "Mi'Matos" equates the mother's tribe to the father's.</p>
<p class="bas indent2"><span class="nm">1.</span>Just like a son has precedence to inherit his father before a daughter, also, to inherit his mother.</p>
<p class="bas subject"><span class="nm">2)</span>A FIRSTBORN'S RIGHTS IN HIS MOTHER'S PROPERTY</p>
<p class="bas indent1"><span class="nm">(a)</span><span class="cl">Question (R. Yehudah Nesi'ah):</span> If so, we should also equate them to say that a firstborn son gets a double portion in the mother's property, like in the father's!</p>
<p class="bas bbbline">111b----------------------------------------111b</p>
<p class="bas indent2"><span class="nm">1.</span>R. Yanai held that the answer was obvious. He left without answering the question.</p>
<p class="bas indent1"><span class="nm">(b)</span><span class="cl">Question:</span> What is the answer?</p>
<p class="bas indent1"><span class="nm">(c)</span><span class="cl">Answer #1 (Abaye):</span> (A firstborn gets a double share) "b'Chol Asher Yimatzei <i>Lo</i>" - not in her (his mother's property).</p>
<p class="bas indent1"><span class="nm">(d)</span><span class="cl">Suggestion:</span> Perhaps this applies only when he is a firstborn only to the father, but not to the mother, but if he is firstborn to both, he receives a double portion also in the mother's property!</p>
<p class="bas indent1"><span class="nm">(e)</span><span class="cl">Rejection (Rav Nachman bar Yitzchak):</span> "Reishis <i>Ono</i>" - not her first strength.</p>
<p class="bas indent1"><span class="nm">(f)</span><span class="cl">Objection:</span> That verse is used to teach that the first viable child (if he is a male) inherits like a firstborn, even if stillborn babies preceded him!</p>
<p class="bas indent2"><span class="nm">1.</span>"Reishis Ono" is the first child that the father is concerned for.</p>
<p class="bas indent1"><span class="nm">(g)</span><span class="cl">Answer:</span> 'Reishis On' would have taught this. The Torah said "Reishis On<i>o</i>" to teach both laws.</p>
<p class="bas indent1"><span class="nm">(h)</span><span class="cl">Question:</span> Still, perhaps we learn that he does not receive a double portion in his mother's property only when he is not a firstborn to the father, only to the mother; but if he is firstborn to both, he receives a double portion also in the mother's property!</p>
<p class="bas indent1"><span class="nm">(i)</span><span class="cl">Answer #2 (Rava):</span> "<i>Lo</i> Mishpat ha'Bechorah" - the law applies only to a man, but not to a woman.</p>
<p class="bas subject"><span class="nm">3)</span>ONE INHERITS HIS WIFE</p>
<p class="bas indent1"><span class="nm">(a)</span><span class="cl">(Mishnah):</span> A man inherits his wife ...</p>
<p class="bas indent1"><span class="nm">(b)</span><span class="cl">(Beraisa):</span> "Sheiro (his close relative)" refers to his wife. It teaches that a husband inherits his wife;</p>
<p class="bas indent2"><span class="nm">1.</span><span class="cl">Suggestion:</span> Perhaps she likewise inherits him!</p>
<p class="bas indent2"><span class="nm">2.</span><span class="cl">Rejection:</span> "V'Yorash Osah", but she does not inherit him.</p>
<p class="bas indent1"><span class="nm">(c)</span><span class="cl">Question:</span> It says "u'Nsatem Es Nachalaso li'Sh'eiro"!</p>
<p class="bas indent1"><span class="nm">(d)</span><span class="cl">Answer #1 (Abaye):</span> We read the verse this way: 'u'Nsatem Es Nachalaso l'Karov Elav'; 'Sh'eiro v'Yarash Osah'.</p>
<p class="bas indent1"><span class="nm">(e)</span><span class="cl">Objection (Rava):</span> The words do not appear in that order in the verse!</p>
<p class="bas indent1"><span class="nm">(f)</span><span class="cl">Answer #2 (Rava):</span> We read "u'Nsatem Es Nachalas Sh'eiro Lo".</p>
<p class="bas indent2"><span class="nm">1.</span>Rava holds that we may expound a verse by cutting letters from words ('Vav' from 'Nachalso', 'Lamed' from 'li'Sheiro'), and combining them (to form 'Lo').</p>
<p class="bas indent1"><span class="nm">(g)</span>A Tana has a different source.</p>
<p class="bas indent2"><span class="nm">1.</span><span class="cl">(Beraisa - R. Akiva):</span> "V'Yorash Osah" teaches that a husband inherits his wife;</p>
<p class="bas indent2"><span class="nm">2.</span><span class="cl">R. Yishmael:</span> We need not expound like this. "V'Chol Bas Yoreshes Nachalah... Tihyeh l'Ishah" discusses transferring inheritance through marriage;</p>
<p class="bas indent3"><span class="nm">i.</span>It also says "v'Lo Tisov Nachalah li'Vnei Yisrael mi'Mateh El Mateh";</p>
<p class="bas indent3"><span class="nm">ii.</span>It also says "v'Lo Tisov Nachalah mi'Mateh l'Mateh Acher";</p>
<p class="bas indent3"><span class="nm">iii.</span>It also says "v'Elazar... va'Yikberu Oso b'Giv'as Pinchas Beno."</p>
<p class="bas indent2"><span class="nm">3.</span><span class="cl">Question:</span> The Pasuk ascribes the land to Pinchas, and not to his father Elazar. How did Pinchas have land if he did not inherit it from his father?</p>
<p class="bas indent2"><span class="nm">4.</span><span class="cl">Answer:</span> We must say that he married a woman, and inherited her.</p>
<p class="bas indent3"><span class="nm">i.</span>It also says "u'Sguv Holid Es Ya'ir va'Yhi Lo (to Ya'ir) Esrim v'Shalosh Arim."</p>
<p class="bas indent3"><span class="nm">ii.</span><span class="cl">Question:</span> How did Ya'ir have land that did not belong to his father?</p>
<p class="bas indent3"><span class="nm">iii.</span><span class="cl">Answer:</span> We must say that he married a woman, and inherited her.</p>
