<div class="indent1"><span class="nm">(a)</span><p><span class="cl">Question:</span> Why are Klei Cheres in the Mikdash broken? We should return them to the furnace (in which they were made. They will be Husak from the inside and outside!)</p></div>
<div class="indent1"><span class="nm">(b)</span><p><span class="cl">Answer (R. Zeira):</span> We do not make furnaces in Yerushalayim (due to the smoke).</p></div>
<div class="indent1"><span class="nm">(c)</span><p><span class="cl">Question (Abaye):</span> Is it better to make wasteheaps (from all the broken Kelim)?</p></div>
<div class="indent1"><span class="nm">(d)</span><p>Abaye was unaware that Shemayah taught that broken Klei Cheres were miraculously swallowed up in their place.</p></div>
<div class="indent1"><span class="nm">(e)</span><p><span class="cl">Question:</span> Rav Nachman taught that the oven in the Mikdash was made of metal.</p></div>
<div class="indent2"><span class="nm">1.</span><p><span class="cl">(Inference:</span> It was not made of Cheres, for Cheres cannot be Kashered.)</p></div>
<div class="indent2"><span class="nm">2.</span><p>Since it is heated from the inside (the same place where it absorbs), it can be Kashered!</p></div>
<div class="indent1"><span class="nm">(f)</span><p><span class="cl">Answer:</span> The Shtei ha'Lechem and Lechem ha'Panim were baked in the oven, therefore it was a Kli Shares; we do not make Klei Shares of Cheres;</p></div>
<div class="bbbline">96b----------------------------------------96b</p></div>
<div class="indent2"><span class="nm">1.</span><p>Even R. Yosi b'Rebbi Yehudah is lenient to allow Klei Shares only of wood, but not of Cheres.</p></div>
<div class="subject"><span class="nm">2)</span><p>MUST THE ENTIRE <i>KLI</i> BE SCOURED?</p></div>
<div class="indent1"><span class="nm">(a)</span><p>R. Yitzchak bar Yehudah used to learn from Rami bar Chama. He abandoned him, and went to learn from Rav Sheshes. One day he encountered Rami bar Chama.</p></div>
<div class="indent2"><span class="nm">1.</span><p><span class="cl">Rami:</span> Because you went to learn from Rav Sheshes, do you think that you are like Rav Sheshes?!</p></div>
<div class="indent2"><span class="nm">2.</span><p><span class="cl">R. Yitzchak:</span> No. I left you, for when I would ask you questions, you would answer from reasoning. If I find a Beraisa that says otherwise, it refutes you;</p></div>
<div class="indent3"><span class="nm">i.</span><p>Rav Sheshes answers from Beraisos. Even if I find a Beraisa that says otherwise, it is no stronger than his Beraisa!</p></div>
<div class="indent2"><span class="nm">3.</span><p><span class="cl">Rami:</span> Ask me a question, and I will answer (from reasoning) just like a Beraisa!</p></div>
<div class="indent1"><span class="nm">(b)</span><p><span class="cl">Question (R. Yitzchak bar Yehudah):</span> If Kodshim were cooked in part of a Kli, is Merikah u'Shtifah required for the part that was not over the fire?</p></div>
<div class="indent1"><span class="nm">(c)</span><p><span class="cl">Answer (Rami bar Chama):</span> It is not required, like we find regarding Haza'ah. (We need not launder an entire garment if Dam Chatas splashed on part of it.)</p></div>
<div class="indent1"><span class="nm">(d)</span><p><span class="cl">R. Yitzchak:</span> You did not answer me like a Beraisa!</p></div>
<div class="indent1"><span class="nm">(e)</span><p><span class="cl">Rami:</span> Surely, the law of Merikah u'Shtifah parallels the law of Haza'ah!</p></div>
<div class="indent1"><span class="nm">(f)</span><p><span class="cl">R. Yitzchak:</span> It is different. Blood does not spread through a garment, but cooking causes absorptions to spread through a Kli!</p></div>
<div class="indent2"><span class="nm">1.</span><p><span class="cl">(Beraisa):</span> Stringencies of Haza'ah (the need to wash Dam Chatas from a garment) over Merikah u'Shtifah are that Haza'ah applies to outer and inner Chata'os, and before Zerikah;</p></div>
<div class="indent2"><span class="nm">2.</span><p>Stringencies of Merikah u'Shtifah over Haza'ah are that Merikah u'Shtifah apply to Kodshei Kodoshim and Kodshim Kalim, and if Kodshim were cooked in part of a Kli, the entire Kli requires Merikah u'Shtifah. This does not apply to Haza'ah.</p></div>
<div class="indent1"><span class="nm">(g)</span><p><span class="cl">Rami:</span> The Beraisa refutes me.</p></div>
<div class="indent1"><span class="nm">(h)</span><p><span class="cl">Question:</span> What is the reason?</p></div>
<div class="indent1"><span class="nm">(i)</span><p><span class="cl">Answer:</span> "V'Im bi'Chli Nechoshes Bushalah" applies even if it was cooked in part of the Kli.</p></div>
<div class="subject"><span class="nm">3)</span><p>WHAT REQUIRES <i>MERIKAH U'SHTIFAH</i>?</p></div>
<div class="indent1"><span class="nm">(a)</span><p><span class="cl">(Mishnah):</span> The law (of Merikah u'Shtifah) applies to Kodshei Kodoshim (and Kodshim Kalim.)</p></div>
<div class="indent1"><span class="nm">(b)</span><p><span class="cl">(Beraisa - R. Yehudah):</span> "Chatas" teaches only about Chatas;</p></div>
<div class="indent2"><span class="nm">1.</span><p><span class="cl">Question:</span> What is the source to include all Kodshim?</p></div>
<div class="indent2"><span class="nm">2.</span><p><span class="cl">Answer:</span> It says "Kodesh Kodoshim Hi."</p></div>
<div class="indent2"><span class="nm">3.</span><p><span class="cl">Suggestion:</span> Perhaps even Terumah is included!</p></div>
<div class="indent2"><span class="nm">4.</span><p><span class="cl">Rejection:</span> "Osah" excludes Terumah.</p></div>
<div class="indent1"><span class="nm">(c)</span><p>R. Shimon says, Kodshei Kodoshim require Merikah u'Shtifah, but Kodshim Kalim do not;</p></div>
<div class="indent2"><span class="nm">1.</span><p>"Kodesh Kodoshim" does not include Kodshim Kalim.</p></div>
<div class="indent1"><span class="nm">(d)</span><p><span class="cl">Question:</span> What is R. Yehudah's reason?</p></div>
<div class="indent1"><span class="nm">(e)</span><p><span class="cl">Answer:</span> Since "Osah" is needed to exclude Terumah, this implies that Kodshim Kalim are included.</p></div>
<div class="indent2"><span class="nm">1.</span><p>R. Shimon uses "Osah" like above (93a, to exclude blood of a Pasul Chatas from the law of laundering.)</p></div>
<div class="indent1"><span class="nm">(f)</span><p><span class="cl">Question:</span> Is it really true that Merikah u'Shtifah does not apply to Terumah?!</p></div>
<div class="indent2"><span class="nm">1.</span><p><span class="cl">(Beraisa):</span> One may not cook milk in a pot in which meat was cooked. If milk was cooked in it, if it absorbed the taste of meat, it is forbidden;</p></div>
<div class="indent2"><span class="nm">2.</span><p>One may not cook Chulin in a pot in which Terumah was cooked. If Chulin was cooked in it, if it absorbed the taste of Terumah, only a Kohen may eat it.</p></div>
<div class="indent1"><span class="nm">(g)</span><p><span class="cl">Answer #1 (Abaye):</span> If Kodshim was cooked in part of a Kli, the entire Kli requires Merikah u'Shtifah;</p></div>
<div class="indent2"><span class="nm">1.</span><p>Regarding Terumah, only that part requires Merikah u'Shtifah.</p></div>
<div class="indent1"><span class="nm">(h)</span><p><span class="cl">Answer #2 (Rava):</span> Regarding Kodshim, water must be used for Merikah u'Shtifah;</p></div>
<div class="indent2"><span class="nm">1.</span><p>Regarding Terumah, even wine or mixed wine may be used.</p></div>
<div class="indent1"><span class="nm">(i)</span><p><span class="cl">Answer #3 (Rabah bar Ula):</span> Regarding Kodshim, we require Merikah u'Shtifah in cold water in addition to Hag'alah (Kashering in boiling water);</p></div>
<div class="indent2"><span class="nm">1.</span><p>Regarding Terumah, Hag'alah is sufficient.</p></div>
<div class="indent1"><span class="nm">(j)</span><p><span class="cl">Question:</span> This is like the opinion that Merikah u'Shtifah is in cold water;</p></div>
<div class="indent2"><span class="nm">1.</span><p>According to the opinion that Merikah is in hot water, and Shtifah is in cold water, how can we answer?</p></div>
<div class="indent1"><span class="nm">(k)</span><p><span class="cl">Answer:</span> Kodshim requires an extra Shtifah.</p></div>
<div class="indent1"><span class="nm">(l)</span><p><span class="cl">(Mishnah - R. Tarfon):</span> If one cooked Kodshim in a pot at the beginning of the festival, he may cook in it the entire festival (without Merikah u'Shtifah).</p></div>
<div class="indent1"><span class="nm">(m)</span><p>Chachamim say, until the (some texts - the entire) time the Kodshim are eaten (this will be explained.)</p></div>
<div class="indent1"><span class="nm">(n)</span><p>Merikah is like rinsing a cup (from the inside). Shtifah is like rinsing a cup (from the outside).</p></div>
