<div class="subject"><span class="nm">1)</span><p>CAN HE WAIVE HIS RIGHT TO INHERIT? (cont.)</p></div>
<div class="indent1"><span class="nm">(a)</span><p><span class="cl">Rejection:</span> Rav holds that a stipulation against the Torah is void!</p></div>
<div class="indent2"><span class="nm">1.</span><p><span class="cl">(Rav):</span> If one says 'I sell this to you on condition that you cannot claim Ona'ah (reimbursement for being overcharged)', the buyer can claim Ona'ah;</p></div>
<div class="indent2"><span class="nm">2.</span><p>Shmuel says, he cannot.</p></div>
<div class="indent1"><span class="nm">(b)</span><p><span class="cl">Answer #2:</span> Rav holds like R. Shimon, that a stipulation contrary to Torah is void, but R. Shimon holds that when she dies, he inherits her, and Rav holds that he does not.</p></div>
<div class="indent1"><span class="nm">(c)</span><p><span class="cl">Rejection:</span> This is like R. Shimon ben Gamliel's reason, but unlike his law!</p></div>
<div class="indent1"><span class="nm">(d)</span><p><span class="cl">Answer #3:</span> Rav says that the Halachah follows R. Shimon ben Gamliel, that when she dies, he inherits her;</p></div>
<div class="indent2"><span class="nm">1.</span><p>R. Shimon holds that a stipulation contrary to Torah is void, but a stipulation contrary to a mid'Rabanan law works. Rav holds that in both cases it is void.</p></div>
<div class="indent1"><span class="nm">(e)</span><p><span class="cl">Rejection:</span> If so, Rav agrees to the law and to the reason, he merely adds (that a stipulation even against mid'Rabanan laws is void)!</p></div>
<div class="indent1"><span class="nm">(f)</span><p><span class="cl">Answer #4:</span> Rav holds like R. Shimon, that when she dies he inherits her; but not for his reason;</p></div>
<div class="indent2"><span class="nm">1.</span><p>R. Shimon holds that a husband inherits his wife mid'Oraisa, and a stipulation contrary to Torah is void. Rav holds that a husband inherits his wife mid'Rabanan, and Chachamim strengthened their enactments as much as Torah law.</p></div>
<div class="indent1"><span class="nm">(g)</span><p><span class="cl">Question:</span> Rav holds that a husband inherits his wife mid'Oraisa!</p></div>
<div class="indent2"><span class="nm">1.</span><p><span class="cl">(Mishnah - R. Yochanan ben Berokah):</span> If a man inherited his wife, he returns the property to her family (in Yovel), and deducts from the money (i.e. they pay a small amount).</p></div>
<div class="indent2"><span class="nm">2.</span><p><span class="cl">Question:</span> Does R. Yochanan ben Berokah say that a husband inherits mid'Oraisa or mid'Rabanan?</p></div>
<div class="indent3"><span class="nm">i.</span><p>If he inherits mid'Oraisa, why must he return the property?</p></div>
<div class="indent3"><span class="nm">ii.</span><p>If he inherits mid'Rabanan, why must they pay him?</p></div>
<div class="indent2"><span class="nm">3.</span><p><span class="cl">Answer (Rav):</span> He holds that he inherits mid'Oraisa. The case is, he inherited a burial site.</p></div>
<div class="indent3"><span class="nm">i.</span><p>To avoid reproach to the family, Chachamim said that he returns the property, and they pay for it.</p></div>
<div class="indent2"><span class="nm">4.</span><p><span class="cl">Question:</span> Why does he deduct from the price?</p></div>
<div class="indent2"><span class="nm">5.</span><p><span class="cl">Answer:</span> He deducts the value of his wife's grave.</p></div>
<div class="indent2"><span class="nm">6.</span><p><span class="cl">(Beraisa):</span> One who sells his gravesite, the path to his gravesite, or the places of stopping during the procession or eulogizing, his family can bury him there against the will of the buyer, to avoid reproach to the family.</p></div>
<div class="indent1"><span class="nm">(h)</span><p><span class="cl">Answer:</span> Rav explained R. Yochanan ben Brokah's opinion. Rav himself holds that a husband inherits mid'Rabanan.</p></div>
<div class="subject"><span class="nm">2)</span><p>COLLECTION OF DEBTS AND A KESUVAH FROM AN ESTATE</p></div>
<div class="indent1"><span class="nm">(a)</span><p><span class="cl">(Mishnah - R. Tarfon):</span> If Levi died, leaving a widow, a creditor and heirs, and someone else had a deposit from Levi or owed a loan to him, it is given to the weakest of them (among the widow, creditor and heirs. The Gemara will discuss who is weakest. Normally, there is no lien on inherited Metaltelim to pay a Kesuvah or debt. Here is different, because they are not in the heir's Reshus.)</p></div>
<div class="indent1"><span class="nm">(b)</span><p>R. Akiva says, we do not show mercy in judgment. Rather, the heirs get it, since a widow or creditor collects only with an oath, but heirs do not need to swear.</p></div>
<div class="indent1"><span class="nm">(c)</span><p>If he left detached Peiros, whoever seizes them first keeps them;</p></div>
<div class="indent1"><span class="nm">(d)</span><p>R. Tarfon says, if the widow or creditor grabbed more than she or he is entitled to, the excess is given to the weakest of them;</p></div>
<div class="indent1"><span class="nm">(e)</span><p>R. Akiva says, we do not show mercy in judgment. Rather, the heirs get it, since a widow or creditor collects only with an oath, but heirs do not need to swear.</p></div>
<div class="indent1"><span class="nm">(f)</span><p><span class="cl">(Gemara) Question:</span> Why must it teach both the case of a deposit and of a loan?</p></div>
<div class="indent1"><span class="nm">(g)</span><p><span class="cl">Answer:</span> Had it taught only about a loan, we would have thought that only in this case R. Tarfon said the heirs do not get it, because a loan is given to be spent;</p></div>
<div class="indent2"><span class="nm">1.</span><p>Regarding a deposit, which is intact, he would agree with R. Akiva that the heirs get it. (It is as if it is already in the heir's Reshus.)</p></div>
<div class="indent2"><span class="nm">2.</span><p>Had it taught only about a deposit, we would have thought that only in this case R. Akiva argues; but regarding a loan, he would agree with R. Tarfon (for the above reason).</p></div>
<div class="indent1"><span class="nm">(h)</span><p><span class="cl">Question:</span> What does 'the weakest' mean?</p></div>
<div class="indent1"><span class="nm">(i)</span><p><span class="cl">Answer #1 (R. Yosi bar Chanina):</span> It is the one with the weakest proof (the latest document, for he has the least ability to collect from sold property).</p></div>
<div class="indent1"><span class="nm">(j)</span><p><span class="cl">Answer #2 (R. Yochanan):</span> It is the widow, to encourage marriage (Rashi - so women will be eager to marry; Tosfos - to encourage men to marry the widow).</p></div>
<div class="indent1"><span class="nm">(k)</span><p>The following Tana'im argued similarly:</p></div>
<div class="indent2"><span class="nm">1.</span><p><span class="cl">(Beraisa - R. Binyamin):</span> It goes to the one with the weakest proof. This is proper;</p></div>
<div class="indent2"><span class="nm">2.</span><p>R. Elazar says, it goes to the widow, to encourage marriage.</p></div>
<div class="indent1"><span class="nm">(l)</span><p><span class="cl">(Mishnah):</span> If he left detached Peiros...</p></div>
<div class="indent1"><span class="nm">(m)</span><p><span class="cl">Question:</span> R. Akiva should say that all go to the heirs, not only the excess (since the others may not collect without an oath)!</p></div>
<div class="indent1"><span class="nm">(n)</span><p><span class="cl">Answer:</span> Indeed, he says so! Since R. Tarfon discussed only the excess, R. Akiva did, too.</p></div>
<div class="bbbline">84b----------------------------------------84b</p></div>
<div class="indent1"><span class="nm">(o)</span><p><span class="cl">Question:</span> Does R. Akiva say that seizing never helps?</p></div>
<div class="indent1"><span class="nm">(p)</span><p><span class="cl">Answer (Rava):</span> Seizing in his lifetime helps.</p></div>
<div class="subject"><span class="nm">3)</span><p>PROPERTY SEIZED AFTER DEATH</p></div>
<div class="indent1"><span class="nm">(a)</span><p><span class="cl">Question:</span> According to R. Tarfon (who says that seizing Peiros after death helps), where are the Peiros? (They cannot be in the heir's house, for then seizure would not help!)</p></div>
<div class="indent1"><span class="nm">(b)</span><p><span class="cl">Answer #1 (Rav and Shmuel):</span> They are in a Reshus ha'Rabim, but not in a Simta (a corner near a Reshus ha'Rabim. Meshichah acquires in a Simta, so it is as if the Peiros are in the heirs' house.)</p></div>
<div class="indent1"><span class="nm">(c)</span><p><span class="cl">Answer #2 (R. Yochanan and Reish Lakish):</span> It can even be in a Simta.</p></div>
<div class="indent1"><span class="nm">(d)</span><p>A case occurred, and judges ruled like R. Tarfon. Reish Lakish overturned the ruling.</p></div>
<div class="indent1"><span class="nm">(e)</span><p><span class="cl">R. Yochanan:</span> You treat R. Akiva's law like mid'Oraisa! (Even b'Di'eved, you do not accept a ruling against it.)</p></div>
<div class="indent1"><span class="nm">(f)</span><p><span class="cl">Suggestion #1:</span> Reish Lakish holds that if a judge makes a clear mistake, the ruling is overturned; R. Yochanan says that it is not.</p></div>
<div class="indent1"><span class="nm">(g)</span><p><span class="cl">Suggestion #2:</span> All agree that if a judge makes a clear mistake, we overturn the ruling. R. Yochanan holds that the Halachah follows R. Akiva when he disagrees with a colleague, but not against his Rebbi (R. Tarfon). Reish Lakish holds that we follow R. Akiva even against his Rebbi.</p></div>
<div class="indent1"><span class="nm">(h)</span><p><span class="cl">Suggestion #3:</span> All agree that the Halachah follows R. Akiva when he disagrees with a colleague, but not against his Rebbi. R. Yochanan holds that R. Tarfon was R. Akiva's Rebbi; Reish Lakish holds that he was his colleague.</p></div>
<div class="indent1"><span class="nm">(i)</span><p><span class="cl">Suggestion #4:</span> All agree that R. Tarfon was R. Akiva's colleague. Reish Lakish holds that the Halachah follows R. Akiva against his colleague; R. Yochanan holds that we merely lean towards R. Akiva's opinion.</p></div>
<div class="indent1"><span class="nm">(j)</span><p>R. Yochanan's relatives seized property from a Simta. He ruled that they seized properly. They came to Reish Lakish, and he said that they must return it.</p></div>
<div class="indent2"><span class="nm">1.</span><p><span class="cl">R. Yochanan:</span> What can I do? My equal argues against me.</p></div>
<div class="indent1"><span class="nm">(k)</span><p>A shepherd was watching cattle of orphans; a creditor seized a cow. The creditor said that he seized it in the life of the father; the shepherd said that he seized it after death.</p></div>
<div class="indent2"><span class="nm">1.</span><p><span class="cl">Rav Nachman:</span> Do you have witnesses that he seized it?</p></div>
<div class="indent2"><span class="nm">2.</span><p><span class="cl">The shepherd:</span> No.</p></div>
<div class="indent2"><span class="nm">3.</span><p><span class="cl">Rav Nachman:</span> Since he could claim that he bought the cow, he is believed to say that he seized it in the father's lifetime.</p></div>
<div class="indent2"><span class="nm">4.</span><p><span class="cl">Question:</span> Reish Lakish taught that custody of an animal does not prove ownership! (One is not believed to say that he bought it, for perhaps he found it wandering outside.)</p></div>
<div class="indent2"><span class="nm">5.</span><p><span class="cl">Answer:</span> He did not refer to animals being watched by a shepherd (they are not left to wander).</p></div>
<div class="indent1"><span class="nm">(l)</span><p>The Nasi's house seized a slave of orphans from a Simta.</p></div>
<div class="indent1"><span class="nm">(m)</span><p>R. Avahu, R. Chanina bar Papi and R. Yitzchak Nafcha: You made a valid seizure. (This is like the Rashash, who says that the text should say 'Amru'.)</p></div>
<div class="indent2"><span class="nm">1.</span><p><span class="cl">R. Aba:</span> Do you flatter them because they are from the Nasi's house?! Judges ruled like R. Tarfon, and Reish Lakish overturned the ruling!</p></div>
