<p class="bas subject"><span class="nm">1)</span>SAFEK YISRAELIM (cont.)</p>
<p class="bas indent1"><span class="nm">(a)</span><span class="cl">(R. Aba bar Kahana):</span> "And he (Sancheriv) settled them in Chalach, Chabor... and the cities of Madai" - these are (now called) Chalazon, Chadyev, Ginzek, Chamdan and its surrounding villages;</p>
<p class="bas indent2"><span class="nm">1.</span>Others say (that Madai is) Nihar, and its surrounding villages.</p>
<p class="bas indent1"><span class="nm">(b)</span><span class="cl">Question:</span> Which are its surrounding villages?</p>
<p class="bas indent1"><span class="nm">(c)</span><span class="cl">Answer (Shmuel):</span> They are Chrach, Moshchi, Chidki and Dumkiya.</p>
<p class="bas indent1"><span class="nm">(d)</span><span class="cl">(R. Yochanan):</span> The lineage of all these places is Pasul.</p>
<p class="bas indent1"><span class="nm">(e)</span><span class="cl">Version #1 (Rav Yehudah citing Shmuel):</span> Your son that comes from a Bas Yisrael is called your son. Your son who comes from a Nochris is not called your son, rather her son (a Nochri. Therefore, we are not concerned for Kidushin of people from these places.)</p>
<p class="bas indent1"><span class="nm">(f)</span><span class="cl">Question:</span> We should be concerned for descendants of females of the 10 Shevatim!</p>
<p class="bas indent2"><span class="nm">1.</span><span class="cl">(Ravina):</span> The son of your daughter from a Nochri is called your son (a Yisrael)!</p>
<p class="bas indent1"><span class="nm">(g)</span><span class="cl">Answer:</span> We have a tradition that girls of that generation (when the 10 Shevatim were exiled) became sterile.</p>
<p class="bas indent1"><span class="nm">(h)</span><span class="cl">Version #2 (Rav Yehudah citing Shmuel):</span> Chachamim at the time immediately declared that they are Nochrim - "They betrayed Hash-m, for they fathered foreign children." (Keren Orah - Chachamim can enact to uproot their Kidushin, but they cannot make them Nochrim in every respect. Alternatively, perhaps Nevi'im, with Ru'ach ha'Kodesh, declared that they are Nochrim in every respect.) (end of Version #2)</p>
<p class="bas indent1"><span class="nm">(i)</span><span class="cl">(Rav Yehudah):</span> Yisrael will make a Yom Tov when Tarmod is destroyed (for Yisraelim intermarry with Mamzerim from there).</p>
<p class="bas indent1"><span class="nm">(j)</span><span class="cl">Question:</span> It already was destroyed!</p>
<p class="bas indent1"><span class="nm">(k)</span><span class="cl">Answer:</span> No, Tamod was destroyed.</p>
<p class="bas indent1"><span class="nm">(l)</span><span class="cl">(Rav Ashi):</span> Tarmod and Tamod are the same. When one side was destroyed, the other side was settled, and vice-versa.</p>
<p class="bas indent1"><span class="nm">(m)</span><span class="cl">(Ula):</span> Rav Hamnuna is a great Chacham. It is a shame that he is from Herpanya (a place of poor lineage).</p>
<p class="bas indent1"><span class="nm">(n)</span>Rav Hamnuna was embarrassed.</p>
<p class="bas indent2"><span class="nm">1.</span><span class="cl">Ula:</span> To where do you pay your head tax?</p>
<p class="bas indent2"><span class="nm">2.</span><span class="cl">Rav Hamnuna:</span> I pay to Fum Nahara.</p>
<p class="bas indent2"><span class="nm">3.</span><span class="cl">Ula:</span> If so, you are considered to be from there (they have good lineage).</p>
<p class="bas indent1"><span class="nm">(o)</span><span class="cl">Question:</span> What is Herpanya?</p>
<p class="bas indent1"><span class="nm">(p)</span><span class="cl">Answer #1 (R. Zeira):</span> It is the HaR (mountain) to which everyone (of bad lineage, who cannot marry elsewhere,) is PoNeh (turns).</p>
<p class="bas indent1"><span class="nm">(q)</span><span class="cl">Answer #2 (Beraisa):</span> Anyone who doesn't know his family and Shevet goes there.</p>
<p class="bas indent1"><span class="nm">(r)</span><span class="cl">(Rava):</span> It is deeper (more irreparable) than Gehenom:</p>
<p class="bas indent2"><span class="nm">1.</span>"From the pit (Gehinom) I will redeem them, from death" - but there is no remedy for Pesulim of Herpanya.</p>
<p class="bas indent1"><span class="nm">(s)</span>The Pesulim of Herpanya came from the Pesulim of Meshan (a nearby city). The Pesulim of Meishan came from the Pesulim of Tarmod. The Pesulim of Tarmod came from the slaves of Shlomo.</p>
<p class="bas indent2"><span class="nm">1.</span>This is like people say, both big and small measures (Pesulim) descend to She'ol (Rashi - Gehenom; Tosfos - Bavel). From She'ol they descend to Tarmod, then to Meishan, and then to Herpanya.</p>

<p class="bas subject"><span class="nm">2)</span>ESHES ACHIV SHE'LO HAYAH B'OLAMO</p>
<p class="bas indent1"><span class="nm">(a)</span><span class="cl">(Mishnah) Question:</span> What is the case of Eshes Achiv she'Lo Hayah b'Olamo (the widow of a brother who died before the Yavam was born)?</p>
<p class="bas indent1"><span class="nm">(b)</span><span class="cl">Answer:</span> Reuven and Shimon are brothers. After Reuven died, Levi (another brother) was born. Then, Shimon did Yibum with Chanah (Reuven's widow), and Shimon died.</p>
<p class="bas indent1"><span class="nm">(c)</span>The first wife is exempt because her husband was not alive in the life of the Yavam; the second wife (of Shimon, Leah,) is exempt because she is Chanah's Tzarah.</p>
<p class="bas indent1"><span class="nm">(d)</span>If Shimon merely gave a Ma'amar to Chanah, Leah does Chalitzah but not Yibum.</p>
<p class="bas indent1"><span class="nm">(e)</span><span class="cl">(Gemara - Rav Nachman):</span> In some texts of the Mishnah, Chanah is called 'the first' wife. In other texts she is called 'the second'. Both of these are proper texts:</p>
<p class="bas bbbline">17b----------------------------------------17b</p>
<p class="bas indent2"><span class="nm">1.</span>She can be called first because she was the first to fall to Yibum;</p>
<p class="bas indent2"><span class="nm">2.</span>She can be called second because she was the second to marry (Shimon).</p>
<p class="bas indent2"><span class="nm">3.</span><span class="cl">Objection:</span> Surely, the Mishnah applies even if Shimon did Yibum before marrying Leah!</p>
<p class="bas indent2"><span class="nm">4.</span><span class="cl">Correction:</span> Rather, Chanah can be called the second because this was her second marriage.</p>
<p class="bas indent1"><span class="nm">(f)</span><span class="cl">Question:</span> Where does the Torah discuss Eshes Achiv she'Lo Hayah b'Olamo?</p>
<p class="bas indent1"><span class="nm">(g)</span><span class="cl">Answer (Rav Yehudah):</span> "Ki Yeshvu Achim Yachdav" - they dwelled together in the world;</p>
<p class="bas indent2"><span class="nm">1.</span>"Yachdav" - they must be able to inherit each other. This excludes maternal brothers.</p>
<p class="bas indent1"><span class="nm">(h)</span><span class="cl">(Rabah):</span> We learn that they must be paternal brothers from a Gezeirah Shavah 'Achvah-Achvah' from Yakov's sons;</p>
<p class="bas indent2"><span class="nm">1.</span>Yakov's sons were paternal brothers, but not maternal brothers. Yibum depends on this.</p>
<p class="bas indent1"><span class="nm">(i)</span><span class="cl">Question:</span> Why don't we learn from 'Achvah' written regarding Arayos?</p>
<p class="bas indent1"><span class="nm">(j)</span><span class="cl">Answer:</span> We learn "Achim" from "Achim", and not from the word "Achicha" written regarding Arayos.</p>
<p class="bas indent1"><span class="nm">(k)</span><span class="cl">Question:</span> We may learn from different words. Tana d'Vei R. Yishmael learns a Gezeirah Shavah between "Returns" and "comes"!</p>
<p class="bas indent1"><span class="nm">(l)</span><span class="cl">Answer:</span> That is only when there are not more similar words. When there are more similar words, we learn from them.</p>
<p class="bas indent1"><span class="nm">(m)</span><span class="cl">Question:</span> Why don't we learn from "Achim" written regarding Lot?</p>
<p class="bas indent1"><span class="nm">(n)</span><span class="cl">Answer:</span> It is better to learn from Bnei Yakov since it is extra, to be expounded;</p>
<p class="bas indent2"><span class="nm">1.</span>It could have said 'We are 12, the sons of one man.' "Achim" is extra for the Gezeirah Shavah.</p>
<p class="bas indent1"><span class="nm">(o)</span>The Torah needed to write "Achim", and also "Yachdav".</p>
<p class="bas indent1"><span class="nm">(p)</span>Had it written only "Achim", one would think to learn from Lot.</p>
<p class="bas indent2"><span class="nm">1.</span>This is reasonable, for "Achim" written regarding Lot is extra. It should have said 'we are friends.'</p>
<p class="bas indent2"><span class="nm">2.</span>Therefore, it says "Yachdav", to teach that they must inherit together.</p>
<p class="bas indent1"><span class="nm">(q)</span>Had it written only "Yachdav", one might have thought that they must have the same mother and father.</p>
<p class="bas indent1"><span class="nm">(r)</span><span class="cl">Question:</span> Why would one think so? Yibum depends on inheritance, which is from the father!</p>
<p class="bas indent1"><span class="nm">(s)</span><span class="cl">Answer:</span> Since Yibum is a Chidush, in which Ervah is permitted, one might have thought that they must be brothers even from the mother.</p>
<p class="bas subject"><span class="nm">3)</span>ZIKAH</p>
<p class="bas indent1"><span class="nm">(a)</span><span class="cl">(Rav Huna citing Rav):</span> If a Yevamah died, her Yavam may marry her mother.</p>
<p class="bas indent1"><span class="nm">(b)</span>He holds that Ein Zikah (a Yevamah is not considered to be Mekudeshes to the Yavam. If he held that Yesh Zikah, her mother would be forbidden to him.)</p>
<p class="bas indent1"><span class="nm">(c)</span><span class="cl">Question:</span> He should have said that the Halachah follows the opinion (Chachamim of R. Yehudah ben Beseira, 41a) that Ein Zikah!</p>
<p class="bas indent1"><span class="nm">(d)</span><span class="cl">Answer:</span> Had he said so, one might have thought that this is only when there is more than one Yavam (since she can do Yibum with any brother, it is unreasonable to say that she is Mekudeshes to one), but when there is only one Yavam, Yesh Zikah!</p>
<p class="bas indent1"><span class="nm">(e)</span><span class="cl">Question:</span> He should have said that the Halachah follows the opinion that Ein Zikah, even when there is one Yavam!</p>
<p class="bas indent1"><span class="nm">(f)</span><span class="cl">Answer:</span> If so, one might have thought that this is true even when she is alive;</p>
<p class="bas indent2"><span class="nm">1.</span>Rather, he teaches that the Yavam may marry her mother only after she dies.</p>
<p class="bas indent2"><span class="nm">2.</span>When she is alive it is forbidden, for this uproots the Mitzvah of Yibum.</p>
<p class="bas indent1"><span class="nm">(g)</span><span class="cl">Question (Mishnah):</span> If a Yevamah died, the Yavam may marry her sister.</p>
<p class="bas indent2"><span class="nm">1.</span><span class="cl">Suggestion:</span> He may marry her sister, but not her mother - (just like death of one's wife permits her sister, but not her mother)!</p>
<p class="bas indent1"><span class="nm">(h)</span><span class="cl">Answer:</span> No, he may marry even her mother;</p>
<p class="bas indent2"><span class="nm">1.</span>The Reisha of that Mishnah permits his wife's sister after his wife dies, but not her mother, for a mother-in-law is forbidden mid'Oraisa even after the wife died;</p>
<p class="bas indent2"><span class="nm">2.</span>Therefore, the Seifa also discusses her sister.</p>
<p class="bas indent1"><span class="nm">(i)</span><span class="cl">(Rav Yehudah):</span> If a Yevamah died, her Yavam may not marry her mother.</p>
<p class="bas indent1"><span class="nm">(j)</span>He holds that Yesh Zikah.</p>
<p class="bas indent1"><span class="nm">(k)</span><span class="cl">Question:</span> He should have said that the Halachah follows the opinion that says Yesh Zikah!</p>
<p class="bas indent1"><span class="nm">(l)</span><span class="cl">Answer #1:</span> If so, one might have thought that is only when there is only one Yavam, but when there is more than one Yavam, Ein Zikah!</p>
<p class="bas indent1"><span class="nm">(m)</span><span class="cl">Objection:</span> They argue about when there is more than one Yavam!</p>
