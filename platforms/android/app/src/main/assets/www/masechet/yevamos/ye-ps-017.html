<div class="subject"><span class="nm">1)</span><p>SAFEK YISRAELIM (cont.)</p></div>
<div class="indent1"><span class="nm">(a)</span><p><span class="cl">(R. Aba bar Kahana):</span> "And he (Sancheriv) settled them in Chalach, Chabor... and the cities of Madai" - these are (now called) Chalazon, Chadyev, Ginzek, Chamdan and its surrounding villages;</p></div>
<div class="indent2"><span class="nm">1.</span><p>Others say (that Madai is) Nihar, and its surrounding villages.</p></div>
<div class="indent1"><span class="nm">(b)</span><p><span class="cl">Question:</span> Which are its surrounding villages?</p></div>
<div class="indent1"><span class="nm">(c)</span><p><span class="cl">Answer (Shmuel):</span> They are Chrach, Moshchi, Chidki and Dumkiya.</p></div>
<div class="indent1"><span class="nm">(d)</span><p><span class="cl">(R. Yochanan):</span> The lineage of all these places is Pasul.</p></div>
<div class="indent1"><span class="nm">(e)</span><p><span class="cl">Version #1 (Rav Yehudah citing Shmuel):</span> Your son that comes from a Bas Yisrael is called your son. Your son who comes from a Nochris is not called your son, rather her son (a Nochri. Therefore, we are not concerned for Kidushin of people from these places.)</p></div>
<div class="indent1"><span class="nm">(f)</span><p><span class="cl">Question:</span> We should be concerned for descendants of females of the 10 Shevatim!</p></div>
<div class="indent2"><span class="nm">1.</span><p><span class="cl">(Ravina):</span> The son of your daughter from a Nochri is called your son (a Yisrael)!</p></div>
<div class="indent1"><span class="nm">(g)</span><p><span class="cl">Answer:</span> We have a tradition that girls of that generation (when the 10 Shevatim were exiled) became sterile.</p></div>
<div class="indent1"><span class="nm">(h)</span><p><span class="cl">Version #2 (Rav Yehudah citing Shmuel):</span> Chachamim at the time immediately declared that they are Nochrim - "They betrayed Hash-m, for they fathered foreign children." (Keren Orah - Chachamim can enact to uproot their Kidushin, but they cannot make them Nochrim in every respect. Alternatively, perhaps Nevi'im, with Ru'ach ha'Kodesh, declared that they are Nochrim in every respect.) (end of Version #2)</p></div>
<div class="indent1"><span class="nm">(i)</span><p><span class="cl">(Rav Yehudah):</span> Yisrael will make a Yom Tov when Tarmod is destroyed (for Yisraelim intermarry with Mamzerim from there).</p></div>
<div class="indent1"><span class="nm">(j)</span><p><span class="cl">Question:</span> It already was destroyed!</p></div>
<div class="indent1"><span class="nm">(k)</span><p><span class="cl">Answer:</span> No, Tamod was destroyed.</p></div>
<div class="indent1"><span class="nm">(l)</span><p><span class="cl">(Rav Ashi):</span> Tarmod and Tamod are the same. When one side was destroyed, the other side was settled, and vice-versa.</p></div>
<div class="indent1"><span class="nm">(m)</span><p><span class="cl">(Ula):</span> Rav Hamnuna is a great Chacham. It is a shame that he is from Herpanya (a place of poor lineage).</p></div>
<div class="indent1"><span class="nm">(n)</span><p>Rav Hamnuna was embarrassed.</p></div>
<div class="indent2"><span class="nm">1.</span><p><span class="cl">Ula:</span> To where do you pay your head tax?</p></div>
<div class="indent2"><span class="nm">2.</span><p><span class="cl">Rav Hamnuna:</span> I pay to Fum Nahara.</p></div>
<div class="indent2"><span class="nm">3.</span><p><span class="cl">Ula:</span> If so, you are considered to be from there (they have good lineage).</p></div>
<div class="indent1"><span class="nm">(o)</span><p><span class="cl">Question:</span> What is Herpanya?</p></div>
<div class="indent1"><span class="nm">(p)</span><p><span class="cl">Answer #1 (R. Zeira):</span> It is the HaR (mountain) to which everyone (of bad lineage, who cannot marry elsewhere,) is PoNeh (turns).</p></div>
<div class="indent1"><span class="nm">(q)</span><p><span class="cl">Answer #2 (Beraisa):</span> Anyone who doesn't know his family and Shevet goes there.</p></div>
<div class="indent1"><span class="nm">(r)</span><p><span class="cl">(Rava):</span> It is deeper (more irreparable) than Gehenom:</p></div>
<div class="indent2"><span class="nm">1.</span><p>"From the pit (Gehinom) I will redeem them, from death" - but there is no remedy for Pesulim of Herpanya.</p></div>
<div class="indent1"><span class="nm">(s)</span><p>The Pesulim of Herpanya came from the Pesulim of Meshan (a nearby city). The Pesulim of Meishan came from the Pesulim of Tarmod. The Pesulim of Tarmod came from the slaves of Shlomo.</p></div>
<div class="indent2"><span class="nm">1.</span><p>This is like people say, both big and small measures (Pesulim) descend to She'ol (Rashi - Gehenom; Tosfos - Bavel). From She'ol they descend to Tarmod, then to Meishan, and then to Herpanya.</p></div>
<div class="perekline">PEREK KEITZAD</div>
<div class="subject"><span class="nm">2)</span><p>ESHES ACHIV SHE'LO HAYAH B'OLAMO</p></div>
<div class="indent1"><span class="nm">(a)</span><p><span class="cl">(Mishnah) Question:</span> What is the case of Eshes Achiv she'Lo Hayah b'Olamo (the widow of a brother who died before the Yavam was born)?</p></div>
<div class="indent1"><span class="nm">(b)</span><p><span class="cl">Answer:</span> Reuven and Shimon are brothers. After Reuven died, Levi (another brother) was born. Then, Shimon did Yibum with Chanah (Reuven's widow), and Shimon died.</p></div>
<div class="indent1"><span class="nm">(c)</span><p>The first wife is exempt because her husband was not alive in the life of the Yavam; the second wife (of Shimon, Leah,) is exempt because she is Chanah's Tzarah.</p></div>
<div class="indent1"><span class="nm">(d)</span><p>If Shimon merely gave a Ma'amar to Chanah, Leah does Chalitzah but not Yibum.</p></div>
<div class="indent1"><span class="nm">(e)</span><p><span class="cl">(Gemara - Rav Nachman):</span> In some texts of the Mishnah, Chanah is called 'the first' wife. In other texts she is called 'the second'. Both of these are proper texts:</p></div>
<div class="bbbline">17b----------------------------------------17b</p></div>
<div class="indent2"><span class="nm">1.</span><p>She can be called first because she was the first to fall to Yibum;</p></div>
<div class="indent2"><span class="nm">2.</span><p>She can be called second because she was the second to marry (Shimon).</p></div>
<div class="indent2"><span class="nm">3.</span><p><span class="cl">Objection:</span> Surely, the Mishnah applies even if Shimon did Yibum before marrying Leah!</p></div>
<div class="indent2"><span class="nm">4.</span><p><span class="cl">Correction:</span> Rather, Chanah can be called the second because this was her second marriage.</p></div>
<div class="indent1"><span class="nm">(f)</span><p><span class="cl">Question:</span> Where does the Torah discuss Eshes Achiv she'Lo Hayah b'Olamo?</p></div>
<div class="indent1"><span class="nm">(g)</span><p><span class="cl">Answer (Rav Yehudah):</span> "Ki Yeshvu Achim Yachdav" - they dwelled together in the world;</p></div>
<div class="indent2"><span class="nm">1.</span><p>"Yachdav" - they must be able to inherit each other. This excludes maternal brothers.</p></div>
<div class="indent1"><span class="nm">(h)</span><p><span class="cl">(Rabah):</span> We learn that they must be paternal brothers from a Gezeirah Shavah 'Achvah-Achvah' from Yakov's sons;</p></div>
<div class="indent2"><span class="nm">1.</span><p>Yakov's sons were paternal brothers, but not maternal brothers. Yibum depends on this.</p></div>
<div class="indent1"><span class="nm">(i)</span><p><span class="cl">Question:</span> Why don't we learn from 'Achvah' written regarding Arayos?</p></div>
<div class="indent1"><span class="nm">(j)</span><p><span class="cl">Answer:</span> We learn "Achim" from "Achim", and not from the word "Achicha" written regarding Arayos.</p></div>
<div class="indent1"><span class="nm">(k)</span><p><span class="cl">Question:</span> We may learn from different words. Tana d'Vei R. Yishmael learns a Gezeirah Shavah between "Returns" and "comes"!</p></div>
<div class="indent1"><span class="nm">(l)</span><p><span class="cl">Answer:</span> That is only when there are not more similar words. When there are more similar words, we learn from them.</p></div>
<div class="indent1"><span class="nm">(m)</span><p><span class="cl">Question:</span> Why don't we learn from "Achim" written regarding Lot?</p></div>
<div class="indent1"><span class="nm">(n)</span><p><span class="cl">Answer:</span> It is better to learn from Bnei Yakov since it is extra, to be expounded;</p></div>
<div class="indent2"><span class="nm">1.</span><p>It could have said 'We are 12, the sons of one man.' "Achim" is extra for the Gezeirah Shavah.</p></div>
<div class="indent1"><span class="nm">(o)</span><p>The Torah needed to write "Achim", and also "Yachdav".</p></div>
<div class="indent1"><span class="nm">(p)</span><p>Had it written only "Achim", one would think to learn from Lot.</p></div>
<div class="indent2"><span class="nm">1.</span><p>This is reasonable, for "Achim" written regarding Lot is extra. It should have said 'we are friends.'</p></div>
<div class="indent2"><span class="nm">2.</span><p>Therefore, it says "Yachdav", to teach that they must inherit together.</p></div>
<div class="indent1"><span class="nm">(q)</span><p>Had it written only "Yachdav", one might have thought that they must have the same mother and father.</p></div>
<div class="indent1"><span class="nm">(r)</span><p><span class="cl">Question:</span> Why would one think so? Yibum depends on inheritance, which is from the father!</p></div>
<div class="indent1"><span class="nm">(s)</span><p><span class="cl">Answer:</span> Since Yibum is a Chidush, in which Ervah is permitted, one might have thought that they must be brothers even from the mother.</p></div>
<div class="subject"><span class="nm">3)</span><p>ZIKAH</p></div>
<div class="indent1"><span class="nm">(a)</span><p><span class="cl">(Rav Huna citing Rav):</span> If a Yevamah died, her Yavam may marry her mother.</p></div>
<div class="indent1"><span class="nm">(b)</span><p>He holds that Ein Zikah (a Yevamah is not considered to be Mekudeshes to the Yavam. If he held that Yesh Zikah, her mother would be forbidden to him.)</p></div>
<div class="indent1"><span class="nm">(c)</span><p><span class="cl">Question:</span> He should have said that the Halachah follows the opinion (Chachamim of R. Yehudah ben Beseira, 41a) that Ein Zikah!</p></div>
<div class="indent1"><span class="nm">(d)</span><p><span class="cl">Answer:</span> Had he said so, one might have thought that this is only when there is more than one Yavam (since she can do Yibum with any brother, it is unreasonable to say that she is Mekudeshes to one), but when there is only one Yavam, Yesh Zikah!</p></div>
<div class="indent1"><span class="nm">(e)</span><p><span class="cl">Question:</span> He should have said that the Halachah follows the opinion that Ein Zikah, even when there is one Yavam!</p></div>
<div class="indent1"><span class="nm">(f)</span><p><span class="cl">Answer:</span> If so, one might have thought that this is true even when she is alive;</p></div>
<div class="indent2"><span class="nm">1.</span><p>Rather, he teaches that the Yavam may marry her mother only after she dies.</p></div>
<div class="indent2"><span class="nm">2.</span><p>When she is alive it is forbidden, for this uproots the Mitzvah of Yibum.</p></div>
<div class="indent1"><span class="nm">(g)</span><p><span class="cl">Question (Mishnah):</span> If a Yevamah died, the Yavam may marry her sister.</p></div>
<div class="indent2"><span class="nm">1.</span><p><span class="cl">Suggestion:</span> He may marry her sister, but not her mother - (just like death of one's wife permits her sister, but not her mother)!</p></div>
<div class="indent1"><span class="nm">(h)</span><p><span class="cl">Answer:</span> No, he may marry even her mother;</p></div>
<div class="indent2"><span class="nm">1.</span><p>The Reisha of that Mishnah permits his wife's sister after his wife dies, but not her mother, for a mother-in-law is forbidden mid'Oraisa even after the wife died;</p></div>
<div class="indent2"><span class="nm">2.</span><p>Therefore, the Seifa also discusses her sister.</p></div>
<div class="indent1"><span class="nm">(i)</span><p><span class="cl">(Rav Yehudah):</span> If a Yevamah died, her Yavam may not marry her mother.</p></div>
<div class="indent1"><span class="nm">(j)</span><p>He holds that Yesh Zikah.</p></div>
<div class="indent1"><span class="nm">(k)</span><p><span class="cl">Question:</span> He should have said that the Halachah follows the opinion that says Yesh Zikah!</p></div>
<div class="indent1"><span class="nm">(l)</span><p><span class="cl">Answer #1:</span> If so, one might have thought that is only when there is only one Yavam, but when there is more than one Yavam, Ein Zikah!</p></div>
<div class="indent1"><span class="nm">(m)</span><p><span class="cl">Objection:</span> They argue about when there is more than one Yavam!</p></div>
