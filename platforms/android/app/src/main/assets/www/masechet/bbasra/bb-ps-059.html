<p class="bas subject"><span class="nm">1)</span>CHAZAKAH FOR A GUTTERPIPE (cont.)</p>
<p class="bas indent1"><span class="nm">(a)</span><span class="cl">Question (Mishnah):</span> One gets a Chazakah for a Mazchilah.</p>
<p class="bas indent2"><span class="nm">1.</span>We understand according to the first two opinions (the neighbor cannot ask him to alter the Mazchilah);</p>
<p class="bas indent2"><span class="nm">2.</span>According to R. Yirmeyah, why can't the neighbor build on his property under the Mazchilah?!</p>
<p class="bas indent1"><span class="nm">(b)</span><span class="cl">Answer:</span> The case is, it is a stone Mazchilah. Building underneath it might make it break.</p>
<p class="bas indent1"><span class="nm">(c)</span><span class="cl">(Rav Yehudah and R. Oshaya):</span> If Reuven's pipe drips water into Shimon's Chatzer, Reuven may not close it;</p>
<p class="bas indent2"><span class="nm">1.</span>Just like Reuven acquired the right to have water from his roof drip there, Shimon acquired the right to receive the water.</p>
<p class="bas indent1"><span class="nm">(d)</span><span class="cl">(R. Chama):</span> Reuven may close it.</p>
<p class="bas indent1"><span class="nm">(e)</span>R. Bisa settled the issue, and said that he may not close it.</p>
<p class="bas indent2"><span class="nm">1.</span>"Veha'Chut ha'Meshulash Lo vi'Mherah Yinasek" - R. Oshaya was the son of R. Chama, who was the son of R. Bisa. (After three generations of Chachamim, Torah will never cease from the family.)</p>
<p class="bas subject"><span class="nm">2)</span>CHAZAKAH FOR LADDER AND WINDOWS</p>
<p class="bas indent1"><span class="nm">(a)</span><span class="cl">(Mishnah):</span> One does not get a Chazakah for a Mitzri ladder.</p>
<p class="bas indent1"><span class="nm">(b)</span><span class="cl">Question:</span> What is considered a Miztri ladder?</p>
<p class="bas indent1"><span class="nm">(c)</span><span class="cl">Answer (D'Vei R. Yanai):</span> It has less than four rungs.</p>
<p class="bas indent1"><span class="nm">(d)</span><span class="cl">(Mishnah):</span> One does not get a Chazakah for a Mitzri window...</p>
<p class="bas indent1"><span class="nm">(e)</span><span class="cl">Question:</span> Why did the Mishnah explain what is a Mitzri window, but not what is a Mitzri ladder?</p>
<p class="bas indent1"><span class="nm">(f)</span><span class="cl">Answer:</span> The Tana needed to explain the window in order to teach R. Yehudah's opinion.</p>
<p class="bas indent1"><span class="nm">(g)</span><span class="cl">(R. Zeira):</span> If Reuven's (Rashbam - Tzuri; R. Tam - Miztri) window is less than four Amos above the ground, he gets a Chazakah. The neighbor can protest (before Reuven gets a Chazakah);</p>
<p class="bas indent2"><span class="nm">1.</span>If it is more than four Amos above the ground, he does not get a Chazakah, and the neighbor cannot protest.</p>
<p class="bas indent1"><span class="nm">(h)</span><span class="cl">(R. Ila'i):</span> Even if it is higher than four Amos, he does not get a Chazakah and the neighbor can protest.</p>
<p class="bas indent1"><span class="nm">(i)</span><span class="cl">Suggestion:</span> They argue about whether or not Kofin Al Midas Sedom (we force one to let another person benefit, if he himself will not lose). R. Zeira holds that we force, and R. Ila'i holds that we do not.</p>
<p class="bas indent1"><span class="nm">(j)</span><span class="cl">Rejection:</span> No, all agree that Kofin Al Midas Sedom;</p>
<p class="bas indent2"><span class="nm">1.</span>This case is different, for sometimes Reuven stands on a bench and sees through the window.</p>
<p class="bas indent1"><span class="nm">(k)</span>David came in front of R. Ami (to request to build a window above four Amos, against his neighbor's protest). R. Ami sent him to R. Aba bar Mamal, and instructed R. Aba to forbid him, like R. Ila'i.</p>
<p class="bas indent1"><span class="nm">(l)</span><span class="cl">(Shmuel):</span> A window made for light (surely, it is meant to be permanent) gets a Chazakah regardless of its size.</p>
<p class="bas subject"><span class="nm">3)</span>CHAZAKAH OF A LEDGE</p>
<p class="bas indent1"><span class="nm">(a)</span><span class="cl">(Mishnah):</span> If a ledge extending from Reuven's wall into Shimon's Chatzer is at least a Tefach, it gets a Chazakah (after three years), and he can protest (Shimon, within three years - Rashbam; Tosfos - and after three years, Reuven can protest to stop Shimon from using it. Rambam - it gets a Chazakah if Shimon does not protest immediately; Reuven can protest, i.e. to stop Shimon from building under it within 10 Tefachim.)</p>
<p class="bas bbbline">59b----------------------------------------59b</p>
<p class="bas indent2"><span class="nm">1.</span>If it is less than a Tefach, it does not get a Chazakah, and he cannot protest.</p>
<p class="bas indent1"><span class="nm">(b)</span><span class="cl">(Gemara - R. Asi):</span> If Reuven got a Chazakah for a Tefach, this is a Chazakah for four.</p>
<p class="bas indent1"><span class="nm">(c)</span><span class="cl">Question:</span> What does this mean?</p>
<p class="bas indent1"><span class="nm">(d)</span><span class="cl">Answer (Abaye):</span> If Reuven got a Chazakah for a ledge a Tefach wide for the length of at least four Tefachim, this is a Chazakah to widen the ledge to four Tefachim.</p>
<p class="bas indent1"><span class="nm">(e)</span><span class="cl">(Mishnah):</span> If it is less than a Tefach, it does not get a Chazakah, and he cannot protest.</p>
<p class="bas indent1"><span class="nm">(f)</span><span class="cl">(Rav Huna):</span> This means that Reuven (who extended a ledge from his roof) cannot protest if Shimon wants to hang things from it (because this does not damage Reuven. Shimon cannot see Reuven when he uses it. Reuven does not lose use of the area, for Shimon could demand that Reuven remove the ledge at any time). Shimon can protest against Reuven (extending or using a ledge, for he sees Shimon then).</p>
<p class="bas indent1"><span class="nm">(g)</span><span class="cl">(Rav Yehudah):</span> Also Shimon cannot protest.</p>
<p class="bas indent1"><span class="nm">(h)</span><span class="cl">Suggestion:</span> They argue about whether loss of privacy is considered damage.</p>
<p class="bas indent1"><span class="nm">(i)</span><span class="cl">Rejection:</span> No, all agree that it is considered damage;</p>
<p class="bas indent2"><span class="nm">1.</span>Rav Yehudah says that Reuven can say 'it is useful only for hanging things. I will look the other way!'</p>
<p class="bas indent2"><span class="nm">2.</span>Rav Huna says, Shimon can object 'you could always look and claim that you were afraid of falling.'</p>
<p class="bas subject"><span class="nm">4)</span>OPENING INTO A JOINTLY OWNED CHATZER</p>
<p class="bas indent1"><span class="nm">(a)</span><span class="cl">(Mishnah):</span> Reuven may not open a window to (facing) a jointly owned Chatzer;</p>
<p class="bas indent1"><span class="nm">(b)</span>If he bought a house in another Chatzer, he may not make an entrance to the (joint) Chatzer;</p>
<p class="bas indent1"><span class="nm">(c)</span>If he built a second story onto his house, he may not make an entrance to the Chatzer;</p>
<p class="bas indent2"><span class="nm">1.</span>He may add an interior room or a second story onto his house, and make the entrance to his house.</p>
<p class="bas indent1"><span class="nm">(d)</span><span class="cl">(Gemara) Question:</span> Why does the Reisha discuss a jointly owned Chatzer? The same applies to a private Chatzer!</p>
<p class="bas indent1"><span class="nm">(e)</span><span class="cl">Answer:</span> The Mishnah teaches a bigger Chidush. He may not open not only to a private Chatzer, but even to a Chatzer in which he is a partner;</p>
<p class="bas indent2"><span class="nm">1.</span>One might have thought that he can tell them 'even without the window you do not have privacy';</p>
<p class="bas indent2"><span class="nm">2.</span>The Mishnah teaches that this is not so. The window decreases their privacy even in their houses.</p>
<p class="bas indent1"><span class="nm">(f)</span><span class="cl">(Beraisa):</span> A case occurred in which Reuven opened a window to a joint Chatzer.</p>
<p class="bas indent2"><span class="nm">1.</span><span class="cl">R. Yishmael b'Rebbi Yosi:</span> This makes a Chazakah.</p>
<p class="bas indent2"><span class="nm">2.</span><span class="cl">R. Chiya:</span> You must close the window (if they object, since you do not yet have three years of Chazakah).</p>
<p class="bas indent1"><span class="nm">(g)</span><span class="cl">(Rav Nachman):</span> If Shimon built a wall blocking light from entering Levi's window (even if the window was there for three years), Shimon is immediately Muchzak;</p>
<p class="bas indent2"><span class="nm">1.</span>If Levi was truly Muchzak in his window, he would never allow someone to block it.</p>
