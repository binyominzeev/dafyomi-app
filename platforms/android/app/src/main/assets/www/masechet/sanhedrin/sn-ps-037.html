<p class="dedicationbox">SANHEDRIN 37 (30 Av) - Today's study material has been dedicated by Al and Sophie Ziegler of Har Nof, Yerushalayim, in honor of the Yahrzeit of Al's father, Bernard B. Ziegler - Binyamin Baruch ben Avraham (and Miryam), which occurs on 30 Menachem Av. </p>

<p class="bas subject"><span class="nm">1)</span>HOW A SANHEDRIN SITS (cont.)</p>
<p class="bas indent1"><span class="nm">(a)</span>Three rows of Chachamim sit in front of the Sanhedrin. Everyone knows his proper place.</p>
<p class="bas indent1"><span class="nm">(b)</span>If they must give Semichah to one (e.g. one of the Sanhedrin died), they are Somech someone in the first row. Someone from the second row goes to the first row, someone from the third row goes to the second, and they choose someone else to sit in the last row;</p>
<p class="bas indent2"><span class="nm">1.</span>He does not sit in the vacated seat, rather, in the place proper for him.</p>
<p class="bas indent1"><span class="nm">(c)</span><span class="cl">(Gemara) Question:</span> What is the source of this?</p>
<p class="bas indent1"><span class="nm">(d)</span><span class="cl">Answer (Rav Acha bar Chanina):</span> "<i>Sharerech</i> Agan ha'Sahar Al Yechsar ha'Mezeg" refers to the Great Sanhedrin;</p>
<p class="bas indent2"><span class="nm">1.</span>It is called Sharerech (navel) because it sits (in Lishkas ha'Gazis (a chamber in the Mikdash),) in the middle of the world.</p>
<p class="bas indent2"><span class="nm">2.</span>It is called "Agan" - because it is Magen (protects) the entire world;</p>
<p class="bas indent2"><span class="nm">3.</span>"Ha'Sahar" - they sit in a (semi-)circle, like the moon;</p>
<p class="bas indent2"><span class="nm">4.</span>"Al Yechsar ha'Mezeg" - one may leave the Sanhedrin only if at least 23 (the size of a small Sanhedrin) will remain.</p>
<p class="bas indent1"><span class="nm">(e)</span>"Bitnech Aremas Chitim" - just like all enjoy wheat, all enjoy the reasons the Sanhedrin gives.</p>
<p class="bas indent1"><span class="nm">(f)</span>"Sugah ba'Shoshanim" - Yisrael do not breach even a wall of roses (Rabbinical enactments).</p>
<p class="bas indent2"><span class="nm">1.</span><span class="cl">A Min (heretic):</span> You permit a Nidah to be secluded with her husband. Is it possible that a fire will not singe chips (can he control his desire)?</p>
<p class="bas indent2"><span class="nm">2.</span><span class="cl">Rav Kahana:</span> The Torah testified about us. "Sugah ba'Shoshanim", we do not breach even a wall of roses.</p>
<p class="bas indent1"><span class="nm">(g)</span><span class="cl">(Reish Lakish):</span> We learn from "k'Felach ha'Rimon <i>Rakasech</i>." Even Reikim (empty Yisraelim) are full of Mitzvos like a pomegranate (is full of seeds).</p>
<p class="bas indent1"><span class="nm">(h)</span><span class="cl">(R. Zeira):</span> We learn from "va'Yarach Es Re'ach Begadav." We read this "Bogedav" (even betrayers in Yisrael have a nice smell).</p>
<p class="bas indent1"><span class="nm">(i)</span>Some uncouth people lived in R. Zeira's area. He endeared them in order to encourage them to repent; other Rabanan were upset about this.</p>
<p class="bas indent2"><span class="nm">1.</span>When R. Zeira died, the people realized that until now R. Zeira used to pray for them, but now no one will pray for them! They did a proper repentance.</p>
<p class="bas subject"><span class="nm">2)</span>FRIGHTENING THE WITNESSES</p>
<p class="bas indent1"><span class="nm">(a)</span><span class="cl">(Mishnah):</span> To frighten the witnesses in capital cases, we bring them in and say 'perhaps you are speaking through estimation, or what you heard from other witnesses;</p>
<p class="bas indent1"><span class="nm">(b)</span>Perhaps you don't know that we will check you with Drishos and Chakiros?</p>
<p class="bas indent1"><span class="nm">(c)</span>You should know that capital cases are not like monetary cases. In monetary cases (if one testified falsely), he could pay and atone for his sin;</p>
<p class="bas indent2"><span class="nm">1.</span>If one killed through false testimony, he is responsible for the victim's blood, and the blood of all the descendants that would have come from him for all generations.</p>
<p class="bas indent2"><span class="nm">2.</span>Kayin killed Hevel. It says "Demei (plural) Achicha", showing that he is liable for his blood and that of the descendants destined to come from him.</p>
<p class="bas indent2"><span class="nm">3.</span>Also, it says Demei because his blood was spilled over wood and stones.</p>
<p class="bas indent1"><span class="nm">(d)</span>Hash-m originally created only one man, to teach that killing one Yisrael is like destroying an entire world, and saving one Yisrael is like saving an entire world.</p>
<p class="bas indent1"><span class="nm">(e)</span>Also, this promotes Shalom among people. One cannot say 'my progenitor was created before yours.'</p>
<p class="bas indent1"><span class="nm">(f)</span>Also, this prevents Minim from saying that there are different powers that created.</p>
<p class="bas indent1"><span class="nm">(g)</span>Also, this shows the greatness of Hash-m. If a person makes a stamp to mint coins, they all look the same;</p>
<p class="bas indent2"><span class="nm">1.</span>Hash-m made all people in the mold of Adam ha'Rishon, yet no two people look alike.</p>
<p class="bas indent1"><span class="nm">(h)</span>Therefore, everyone must say 'the world was created for me.'</p>
<p class="bas indent1"><span class="nm">(i)</span><span class="cl">Suggestion:</span> Perhaps you (the witnesses) will say 'why should we get involved in this matter (to kill the defendant)'?</p>
<p class="bas bbbline">37b----------------------------------------37b</p>
<p class="bas indent1"><span class="nm">(j)</span><span class="cl">Rejection:</span> "V'Hu Ed Oh Ra'ah Oh Yada Im Lo Yagid" - if you saw, you must testify.</p>
<p class="bas indent1"><span class="nm">(k)</span><span class="cl">Suggestion:</span> Perhaps you will say 'why should we be liable for his blood?'</p>
<p class="bas indent1"><span class="nm">(l)</span><span class="cl">Rejection:</span> "Va'Avod Resha'im Rinah" - there will not be retribution.'</p>
<p class="bas indent1"><span class="nm">(m)</span>(Gemara - Beraisa) What is saying by estimation? Perhaps you saw Reuven chasing Shimon to kill him, and you found Reuven holding a sword dripping with blood, and Shimon was murdered and still quivering. If so, you saw nothing (to testify about)!</p>
<p class="bas indent2"><span class="nm">1.</span><span class="cl">(Beraisa - Shimon ben Shetach):</span> I saw Levi chasing Yehudah into a ruin. I ran after him, and I found Levi holding a sword dripping with blood and Yehudah was murdered and quivering. I said 'Rasha, who killed him, me or you?! However, I cannot do anything - "Al Pi Shnayim Edim Yumas ha'Mes." The One who knows thoughts will punish one who kills another.'</p>
<p class="bas indent2"><span class="nm">2.</span>Before he moved, a snake bit Levi and killed him.</p>
<p class="bas indent1"><span class="nm">(n)</span><span class="cl">Question:</span> This was not the proper death penalty for Levi! (A murderer is beheaded with a sword.)</p>
<p class="bas indent2"><span class="nm">1.</span><span class="cl">(Rav Yosef):</span> After the Mikdash was destroyed, even though the Sanhedrin does not sit (in its place, to judge capital cases), the four death penalties did not cease.</p>
<p class="bas indent2"><span class="nm">2.</span><span class="cl">Objection:</span> Indeed, they ceased!</p>
<p class="bas indent2"><span class="nm">3.</span><span class="cl">Correction:</span> Rather, death according to the four death penalties did not cease;</p>
<p class="bas indent3"><span class="nm">i.</span>One who deserves stoning (Beis Din throws him down from a height; if he survives, they drop a boulder on him, if necessary, everyone throws rocks at him) falls from a roof, or a beast tramples him;</p>
<p class="bas indent3"><span class="nm">ii.</span>One who deserves burning falls into a fire, or a snake bites him (the venom burns him);</p>
<p class="bas indent3"><span class="nm">iii.</span>One who deserves the sword, the kingdom kills him (e.g. by a guillotine) or robbers stab him;</p>
<p class="bas indent3"><span class="nm">iv.</span>One who deserves choking drowns in a river or dies of quinsy (a throat sickness).</p>
<p class="bas indent1"><span class="nm">(o)</span><span class="cl">Answer:</span> Levi had done another transgression worthy of burning.</p>
<p class="bas indent2"><span class="nm">1.</span>Someone liable for two different Misos Beis Din receives the more severe one. (All agree that burning is more severe than the sword.)</p>
<p class="bas indent1"><span class="nm">(p)</span><span class="cl">(Mishnah):</span> (You may not testify) by estimation.</p>
<p class="bas indent1"><span class="nm">(q)</span><span class="cl">Inference:</span> In capital cases, testimony by estimation is invalid, but it is valid for monetary cases!</p>
<p class="bas indent1"><span class="nm">(r)</span><span class="cl">Suggestion:</span> Our Mishnah is like R. Acha.</p>
<p class="bas indent2"><span class="nm">1.</span><span class="cl">(Beraisa - R. Acha):</span> If a dead camel was found next to a mating camel (some say - a camel that bites), we are sure that it killed it.</p>
<p class="bas indent1"><span class="nm">(s)</span><span class="cl">Objection:</span> We also tell them that Ed mi'Pi Ed (a witness who testifies about what he heard from another witness) is unacceptable. Will you also infer that this is Kosher for monetary cases?!</p>
<p class="bas indent2"><span class="nm">1.</span><span class="cl">(Mishnah):</span> If he says 'Reuven himself told me', or 'Ploni told me', this is not testimony;</p>
<p class="bas indent2"><span class="nm">2.</span>He must say 'Reuven admitted to him in front of us that he owes him 200.'</p>
<p class="bas indent1"><span class="nm">(t)</span><span class="cl">Conclusion:</span> Even though it is also invalid for monetary cases, we tell capital witnesses that it is invalid. The same applies to testimony by estimation.</p>
<p class="bas subject"><span class="nm">3)</span>GALUS ATONES</p>
<p class="bas indent1"><span class="nm">(a)</span><span class="cl">(Mishnah):</span> You should know (...It says Demei, because his blood was on wood and stones.)</p>
<p class="bas indent1"><span class="nm">(b)</span><span class="cl">(Rav Yehudah brei d'R. Chiya):</span> This teaches that Kayin wounded Hevel in many places. He did not know where to hit him to kill him, until he struck his neck.</p>
<p class="bas indent1"><span class="nm">(c)</span><span class="cl">(Rav Yehudah brei d'R. Chiya):</span> From the day that the earth opened its mouth to swallow Hevel's blood, it did not open it again. "Mi'Kenaf ha'Aretz Zmiros Shomanu", we hear from the corner of the earth, but not from the mouth.</p>
<p class="bas indent1"><span class="nm">(d)</span><span class="cl">Question (Chizkiyah):</span> "Va'Tiftach ha'Aretz Es Piha"!</p>
<p class="bas indent1"><span class="nm">(e)</span><span class="cl">Answer (Rav Yehudah):</span> It opened its mouth for evil, but not for good.</p>
<p class="bas indent1"><span class="nm">(f)</span><span class="cl">(Rav Yehudah brei d'R. Chiya):</span> Galus atones halfway. Kayin's judgment was "v'Hayisi Na va'Nod." He only needed to fulfill half, "va'Yeshev b'Eretz Nod."</p>
<p class="bas indent1"><span class="nm">(g)</span><span class="cl">(Rav Yehudah):</span> Galus atones for three things:"Ba'Cherev uva'Ra'av uva'Dever (one who was liable to die by the sword, hunger or a plague)... v'Nofal Al ha'Kasdim... v'Chayah" (if he will be exiled by the Babylonians, he will live).</p>
<p class="bas indent1"><span class="nm">(h)</span><span class="cl">(R. Yochanan):</span> Galus atones for everything. "Ha'Ish ha'Zeh Ariri... Lo Yitzlach mi'Zar'o... Al Kisei" (Yechanyah will not have children, and his throne will not pass to his seed). After he was exiled, it says "u'Vnei Yechanyah Asir She'alti'el Beno";</p>
<p class="bas indent2"><span class="nm">1.</span>His son is called "Asir" because he was conceived in jail;</p>
<p class="bas indent2"><span class="nm">2.</span>"She'alti'el" - Hash-m was Shosel (planted) him in the womb unnaturally. Normally, a woman does not get pregnant through Bi'ah while standing (the semen falls out), but his mother did. (There was no room in the jail cell for them to lie down.)</p>
<p class="bas indent2"><span class="nm">3.</span>Also, he is called She'alti'el because Hash-m was Sho'el on (permitted) His vow that Yechanyah would not have children.</p>
<p class="bas indent2"><span class="nm">4.</span>His son is called Zerubavel because he was Nizra (conceived) in Bavel;</p>
<p class="bas indent2"><span class="nm">5.</span>His son's true name was Nechemyah ben Chachalyah. (The Ramah asks that he was the son of Yechanyah. Also, verses list Zerubavel separately from Nechemyah! Margoliyas ha'Yam answers that 'ben Chachalyah' means 'the son of one who was Chayav Kelayah (worthy to be destroyed)', and a different Nechemyah was listed with Zerubavel.)</p>
