<div class="subject"><span class="nm">1)</span><p>AN <i>OLAH</i> IS SLAUGHTERED IN <i>TZAFON</i></p></div>
<div class="indent1"><span class="nm">(a)</span><p><span class="cl">(Mishnah):</span> The Par and Sa'ir of Yom Kipur (are slaughtered in Tzafon...)</p></div>
<div class="indent1"><span class="nm">(b)</span><p><span class="cl">Question:</span> The Torah explicitly says that Shechitah of an Olah must be in Tzafon. The Tana should have taught Olah first!</p></div>
<div class="indent1"><span class="nm">(c)</span><p><span class="cl">Answer:</span> Since we need to expound to learn the law of Chata'os, the Tana treasures this law more, therefore he taught it first.</p></div>
<div class="indent1"><span class="nm">(d)</span><p><span class="cl">Question:</span> Why did he teach inner Chata'os before outer Chata'os?</p></div>
<div class="indent1"><span class="nm">(e)</span><p><span class="cl">Answer:</span> Because their blood is brought into the Kodesh ha'Kodoshim, it is more dear to him.</p></div>
<div class="indent1"><span class="nm">(f)</span><p><span class="cl">Question:</span> Where does the Torah teach that Shechitah of an Olah must be in Tzafon?</p></div>
<div class="indent1"><span class="nm">(g)</span><p><span class="cl">Answer:</span> "V'Shachat Oso... Tzafonah".</p></div>
<div class="indent1"><span class="nm">(h)</span><p><span class="cl">Question:</span> That discusses a Seh. What is the source for a bull?</p></div>
<div class="indent1"><span class="nm">(i)</span><p><span class="cl">Answer:</span> The Torah teaches about a bull, and then it says "<i>v</i>'Im Min ha'Tzon" to connect the Parshiyos. We learn the former from the latter.</p></div>
<div class="subject"><span class="nm">2)</span><p><i>ASHAM TALUY</i> IS LEARNED FROM THE FOLLOWING SECTION</p></div>
<div class="indent1"><span class="nm">(a)</span><p><span class="cl">Question:</span> This is like the opinion that we can learn the former from the latter when a 'Vov' connects the Parshiyos. According to the opinion that we can learn only the latter from the former, how can we answer?</p></div>
<div class="indent2"><span class="nm">1.</span><p><span class="cl">(Beraisa - R. Akiva):</span> "V'Im Nefesh..." obligates an Asham Taluy for Safek Me'ilah;</p></div>
<div class="indent2"><span class="nm">2.</span><p>Chachamim exempt.</p></div>
<div class="indent2"><span class="nm">3.</span><p><span class="cl">Suggestion:</span> R. Akiva holds that we can learn the former (Asham Taluy) from the latter (Asham Me'ilah), and Chachamim say that we cannot.</p></div>
<div class="indent1"><span class="nm">(b)</span><p><span class="cl">Answer (Rav Papa):</span> No, all agree that we can learn;</p></div>
<div class="indent2"><span class="nm">1.</span><p>Chachamim exempt due to a Gezerah Shavah "Mitzvos-Mitzvos" between Asham Taluy and a regular Chatas, e.g. for eating Chelev;</p></div>
<div class="indent3"><span class="nm">i.</span><p>Just like there it refers to a transgression punishable by Kares (if Mezid) and Chatas (if Shogeg), also Asham Taluy is brought only for such Aveiros. (There is no Kares for Me'ilah)</p></div>
<div class="indent2"><span class="nm">2.</span><p>R. Akiva says, there it refers to a Chatas Kavu'ah (even a poor person must bring an animal). Also Asham Taluy is brought only for such Aveiros.</p></div>
<div class="indent3"><span class="nm">i.</span><p>This excludes a Tamei who entered the Mikdash or ate Kodshim. The Korban for this is Oleh v'Yored.</p></div>
<div class="indent2"><span class="nm">3.</span><p>Chachamim disagree, for we do not learn a Gezerah Shavah only half-way (rather, we learn all possible laws).</p></div>
<div class="indent1"><span class="nm">(c)</span><p><span class="cl">Question:</span> R. Akiva should agree that we learn all possible laws from a Gezerah Shavah!</p></div>
<div class="indent1"><span class="nm">(d)</span><p><span class="cl">Answer:</span> Indeed, he does. R. Akiva exempts because 'Vov' connects to the next Parshah.</p></div>
<div class="indent1"><span class="nm">(e)</span><p><span class="cl">Question:</span> Why do Chachamim argue?</p></div>
<div class="indent2"><span class="nm">1.</span><p><span class="cl">Suggestion:</span> R. Akiva holds that a Hekesh (to the next Parshah) overrides a Gezerah Shavah (to a regular Chatas, which would exclude Me'ilah). Chachamim hold that a Gezerah Shavah overrides a Hekesh.</p></div>
<div class="indent1"><span class="nm">(f)</span><p><span class="cl">Answer:</span> No, all agree that a Hekesh is stronger. Chachamim say that the former Parshah teaches to the latter, that one must pay at least two Shekalim for it;</p></div>
<div class="indent2"><span class="nm">1.</span><p>One might have thought that Asham Taluy (for a Safek transgression) should not be more stringent than a Chatas for a definite Aveirah, which can be bought for a sixth of a Dinar (or even less). The Hekesh teaches that this is not so.</p></div>
<div class="indent1"><span class="nm">(g)</span><p><span class="cl">Question:</span> What is R. Akiva's source for this law?</p></div>
<div class="indent1"><span class="nm">(h)</span><p><span class="cl">Answer:</span> He learns from "Zos Toras ha'Asham" - the same applies to all Ashamos.</p></div>
<div class="indent1"><span class="nm">(i)</span><p><span class="cl">Question:</span> There is an opinion that does not expound this Hekesh. What is his source (according to R. Akiva)?</p></div>
<div class="indent1"><span class="nm">(j)</span><p><span class="cl">Answer:</span> He learns from a Gezerah Shavah "b'Erkecha-b'Erkecha" from Asham Me'ilah.</p></div>
<div class="indent1"><span class="nm">(k)</span><p><span class="cl">Question:</span> This teaches about Asham Taluy and Asham Gezeilah, but not Asham Shifchah Charufah (regarding which it does not say 'b'Erkecha')!</p></div>
<div class="indent1"><span class="nm">(l)</span><p><span class="cl">Answer:</span> He learns from a Gezerah Shavah "b'Ayil-b''Ayil" from Asham Me'ilah.</p></div>
<div class="subject"><span class="nm">3)</span><p><i>CHATAS</i> IS SLAUGHTERED IN <i>TZAFON</i></p></div>
<div class="indent1"><span class="nm">(a)</span><p><span class="cl">Question:</span> What is the source that Chatas must be slaughtered in Tzafon?</p></div>
<div class="indent1"><span class="nm">(b)</span><p><span class="cl">Answer:</span> "V'Shachat Es ha'Chatas bi'Mkom ha'Olah."</p></div>
<div class="indent1"><span class="nm">(c)</span><p><span class="cl">Question:</span> This teaches about Shechitah. What is the source for Kabalah?</p></div>
<div class="indent1"><span class="nm">(d)</span><p><span class="cl">Answer:</span> "V'Lakach ha'Kohen mi'Dam ha'Chatas" (presumably, in the same place it was slaughtered).</p></div>
<div class="indent1"><span class="nm">(e)</span><p><span class="cl">Question:</span> What is the source that the Kohen who is Mekabel must be in Tzafon?</p></div>
<div class="indent1"><span class="nm">(f)</span><p><span class="cl">Answer:</span> We rearrange the letters of "v'Lakach" to spell 'Lo (Yi)Kach' (he will bring himself there).</p></div>
<div class="indent1"><span class="nm">(g)</span><p><span class="cl">Question:</span> This teaches that these Avodos should be done in Tzafon. What is the source that this is Me'akev?</p></div>
<div class="indent1"><span class="nm">(h)</span><p><span class="cl">Answer:</span> We learn from "v'Shachat Oso bi'Mkom Asher Yishchat Es ha'Olah" (regarding a Sa'ir Chatas of a Nasi):</p></div>
<div class="indent2"><span class="nm">1.</span><p><span class="cl">(Beraisa):</span> (This verse teaches that) Chatas is slaughtered in Tzafon, just like Olah.</p></div>
<div class="bbbline">48b----------------------------------------48b</p></div>
<div class="indent2"><span class="nm">2.</span><p><span class="cl">Question:</span> We already learned this from "(Zos Toras ha'Chatas) bi'Mkom Asher Tishachet ha'Olah Tishachet ha'Chatas"!</p></div>
<div class="indent2"><span class="nm">3.</span><p><span class="cl">Answer:</span> "Oso" teaches that this is Me'akev. (If it was not slaughtered in Tzafon, it is Pasul.)</p></div>
<div class="indent2"><span class="nm">4.</span><p><span class="cl">Suggestion:</span> Perhaps it does not teach this, but rather, that other Se'irim (Chata'os) require (Shechitah in) Tzafon!</p></div>
<div class="indent2"><span class="nm">5.</span><p><span class="cl">Rejection:</span> "V'Shachat Es ha'Chatas bi'Mkom ha'Olah" is a Binyan Av (precedent). It teaches that all Chata'os require Tzafon.</p></div>
<div class="indent1"><span class="nm">(i)</span><p><span class="cl">Question:</span> We learned that Tzafon is Me'akev regarding the Chatas of a Nasi, and that all Chata'os require Tzafon l'Chatchilah. What is the source that this is Me'akev regarding all Chata'os?</p></div>
<div class="indent1"><span class="nm">(j)</span><p><span class="cl">Answer:</span> A verse requires Tzafon for a commoner who brings a goat. Another verse requires it when he brings a lamb (and we could have learned one from the other). The extra verse teaches that this is Me'akev.</p></div>
<div class="subject"><span class="nm">4)</span><p>THE <i>MI'UT</i> OF "OSO</p></div>
<div class="indent1"><span class="nm">(a)</span><p><span class="cl">Question:</span> Since this teaches about all Chata'os, why do we need "v'Shachat Oso..."?</p></div>
<div class="indent1"><span class="nm">(b)</span><p><span class="cl">Answer #1:</span> It teaches like the following Beraisa.</p></div>
<div class="indent2"><span class="nm">1.</span><p><span class="cl">Beraisa:</span> "Oso" - an obligatory Chatas requires Tzafon. The Chatas of Nachshon (or any other Nasi during the inauguration of the Mishkan) did not require Tzafon;</p></div>
<div class="indent3"><span class="nm">i.</span><p><span class="cl">(Beraisa - R. Yehudah):</span> "V'Samach Yado Al Rosh ha'Sa'ir" includes the Se'ir Chatas of Nachshon (it required Semichah).</p></div>
<div class="indent3"><span class="nm">ii.</span><p>R. Shimon says, it includes Se'irim (for He'elem Davar) of idolatry.</p></div>
<div class="indent2"><span class="nm">2.</span><p><span class="cl">Summation of answer:</span> Since Se'ir Nachshon required Semichah, one might have thought that it required also Tzafon. "Oso" teaches that this is not so.</p></div>
<div class="indent1"><span class="nm">(c)</span><p><span class="cl">Objection #1 (Ravina):</span> This answers for R. Yehudah, who says that Se'ir Nachshon required Semichah. According to R. Shimon, how can we answer?</p></div>
<div class="indent1"><span class="nm">(d)</span><p><span class="cl">Objection #2 (Mar Zutra brei d'Rav Tavi):</span> This does not answer even for R. Yehudah. We learned only that Se'ir Nachshon required Semichah. This does not suggest that it required Tzafon!</p></div>
<div class="indent2"><span class="nm">1.</span><p><span class="cl">Suggestion:</span> If "Oso" did not exclude this, we would learn it from a Binyan Av (from permanent Chata'os, i.e. that apply for all generations).</p></div>
<div class="indent2"><span class="nm">2.</span><p><span class="cl">Rejection:</span> If so, we would not need a verse to teach about Semichah. We would learn it from the Binyan Av!</p></div>
<div class="indent3"><span class="nm">i.</span><p>We must say that we do not learn (Semichah regarding Korbanos of Chanukas ha'Mishkan) from permanent Korbanos. The same applies to Tzafon!</p></div>
<div class="indent1"><span class="nm">(e)</span><p>(Sefas Emes suggests that (b:1) is not a Beraisa, for the Gemara refutes it (Oso is not needed to teach about Se'ir Nachshon). Our Sugya is repeated in Menachos, and it is not called a Beraisa there. Alternatively, it is a Beraisa. It is like R. Shimon, who indeed learns Semichah for Se'ir Nachshon from permanent Korbanos, and needs "Oso" to exclude Tzafon, unlike Ravina.)</p></div>
<div class="indent1"><span class="nm">(f)</span><p><span class="cl">Answer #2:</span> "Oso" teaches that the Shechitah (i.e. the animal) must be in Tzafon, but the slaughterer need not be in Tzafon.</p></div>
<div class="indent1"><span class="nm">(g)</span><p><span class="cl">Objection:</span> We learn that from R. Achya!</p></div>
<div class="indent2"><span class="nm">1.</span><p><span class="cl">(Beraisa - R. Achya) Question:</span> What do we learn from "v'Shachat Oso Al Yerech ha'Mizbe'ach Tzafonah"?</p></div>
<div class="indent2"><span class="nm">2.</span><p><span class="cl">Answer:</span> We know that Kabalah (of Kodshei Kodoshim) and the Mekabel must be in Tzafon. If the Mekabel was in the south, it is Pasul. One might have thought that the same applies to Shechitah;</p></div>
<div class="indent3"><span class="nm">i.</span><p>"V'Shachat Oso..." - it (the Korban) must be in Tzafon, but the slaughterer need not be in Tzafon.</p></div>
<div class="indent1"><span class="nm">(h)</span><p><span class="cl">Answer #3:</span> "Oso" teaches that (an Olah must be slaughtered in Tzafon, but) Melikah need not be in Tzafon.</p></div>
<div class="indent2"><span class="nm">1.</span><p><span class="cl">(Beraisa) Suggestion:</span> A Kal va'Chomer should teach that Melikah requires Tzafon!</p></div>
<div class="indent3"><span class="nm">i.</span><p>The Torah does not require a Kohen to slaughter a Seh (Olah; a Zar may slaughter it), yet it requires Tzafon. The Torah requires a Kohen for Melikah, all the more so it should require Tzafon!</p></div>
<div class="indent2"><span class="nm">2.</span><p><span class="cl">Rejection:</span> It says "Oso". (Shechitas Olah must be in Tzafon, but Melikah need not be.)</p></div>
<div class="indent1"><span class="nm">(i)</span><p><span class="cl">Objection:</span> We do not need a verse for this. The Kal va'Chomer can be refuted!</p></div>
<div class="indent2"><span class="nm">1.</span><p>We cannot learn from an Olah, for this requires a Keli (for the Kabalah and Shechitah; Tosfos - both need a Keli Shares), but Melikah does not! (Sefas Emes - the 'rejections' of this and the coming Beraisa are according to the Tana R. Achya.)</p></div>
<div class="indent1"><span class="nm">(j)</span><p><span class="cl">Answer #4:</span> "Oso" teaches that Olah must be slaughtered in Tzafon, but Korban Pesach need not be.</p></div>
<div class="indent2"><span class="nm">1.</span><p><span class="cl">(Beraisa - R. Eliezer ben Yakov) Suggestion:</span> A Kal va'Chomer should teach that Pesach requires Tzafon!</p></div>
<div class="indent3"><span class="nm">i.</span><p>The Torah did not fix a time to slaughter an Olah (a Nedavah), yet it requires Tzafon. The Torah fixed a time for Korban Pesach (the afternoon of Erev Pesach), all the more so it should require Tzafon!</p></div>
<div class="indent2"><span class="nm">2.</span><p><span class="cl">Rejection:</span> "Oso" (Pesach does not require Tzafon).</p></div>
<div class="indent2"><span class="nm">3.</span><p><span class="cl">Question:</span> We do not need a verse for this. The Kal va'Chomer can be refuted!</p></div>
<div class="indent3"><span class="nm">i.</span><p>We cannot learn from an Olah, for it is totally burned on the Mizbe'ach!</p></div>
<div class="indent2"><span class="nm">4.</span><p><span class="cl">Answer #1:</span> We would have learned a Kal va'Chomer from Chatas.</p></div>
<div class="indent2"><span class="nm">5.</span><p><span class="cl">Objection:</span> We cannot learn from Chatas, for it atones for Chayavei Kerisus!</p></div>
<div class="indent2"><span class="nm">6.</span><p><span class="cl">Answer #2:</span> We would have learned a Kal va'Chomer from Asham.</p></div>
<div class="indent2"><span class="nm">7.</span><p><span class="cl">Objection:</span> We cannot learn from Asham, for it is Kodshei Kodoshim!</p></div>
<div class="indent3"><span class="nm">i.</span><p>Olah and Chatas are also Kodshei Kodoshim, so we cannot learn from the Tzad ha'Shavah of all three.</p></div>
<div class="indent1"><span class="nm">(k)</span><p><span class="cl">Defense of Answer #2 (to Question (a)):</span> Indeed, "Oso" teaches that the animal must be slaughtered in Tzafon.</p></div>
<div class="indent1"><span class="nm">(l)</span><p><span class="cl">Question:</span> We learn that from R. Achya's teaching!</p></div>
<div class="indent1"><span class="nm">(m)</span><p><span class="cl">Answer:</span> Indeed, we expound like R. Achya. "Oso" in Parshas Olah teaches that the slaughterer need not be in Tzafon;</p></div>
<div class="indent2"><span class="nm">1.</span><p>The Chidush of "Oso" (written regarding Se'ir Nasi) is the inference. The slaughterer need not be in Tzafon, but the Mekabel must be.</p></div>
<div class="indent1"><span class="nm">(n)</span><p><span class="cl">Question:</span> We already know this from "v'Lakach" (which we rearrange to spell 'Lo (Yi) Kach')!</p></div>
<div class="indent1"><span class="nm">(o)</span><p><span class="cl">Answer:</span> This Tana does not expound "v'Lakach" this way.</p></div>
<div class="subject"><span class="nm">5)</span><p>SHECHITAH AND KABALAH IN TZAFON. IS ME'AKEV</p></div>
<div class="indent1"><span class="nm">(a)</span><p><span class="cl">Question:</span> We find that l'Chatchilah, Shechitah and Kabalah of an Olah must be in Tzafon. What is the source that both are Me'akev?</p></div>
<div class="indent1"><span class="nm">(b)</span><p><span class="cl">Answer #1 (Rav Ada bar Ahavah):</span> We learn from a Kal va'Chomer. We learned that Chatas requires Tzafon from Olah, and it is Me'akev regarding Chatas. All the more so it is Me'akev regarding Olah!</p></div>
<div class="indent1"><span class="nm">(c)</span><p><span class="cl">Objection:</span> We cannot learn from Chatas, for it atones for Chayavei Kerisus!</p></div>
<div class="indent1"><span class="nm">(d)</span><p><span class="cl">Answer (Rava):</span> That refutes a normal Kal va'Chomer;</p></div>
<div class="indent2"><span class="nm">1.</span><p>Rav Ada learns differently, i.e. we never find Tafel Chamur Min ha'Ikar (what is secondary is more stringent than what is primary; in this case, the matter learned cannot be more stringent than the source)!</p></div>
