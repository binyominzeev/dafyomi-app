<p class="bas subject"><span class="nm">1)</span>REGARDING WHAT IS SHE BELIEVED? (cont.)</p>
<p class="bas indent1"><span class="nm">(a)</span><span class="cl">Beis Shamai:</span> We can learn from the Kesuvah. He writes 'If you will get married to another, you will receive what is written'!</p>
<p class="bas indent2"><span class="nm">1.</span>Beis Hillel retracted and agreed to Beis Shamai.</p>
<p class="bas indent1"><span class="nm">(b)</span><span class="cl">(Gemara - Rav Chisda):</span> If she did Yibum, the Yavam inherits his brother based on her testimony.</p>
<p class="bas indent2"><span class="nm">1.</span>Beis Shamai and Beis Hillel expounded what is written in the Kesuvah. We must expound what the Torah says!</p>
<p class="bas indent2"><span class="nm">2.</span>"He will stand up on the name of his brother" - he fulfilled this!</p>
<p class="bas indent1"><span class="nm">(c)</span><span class="cl">(Rav Nachman):</span> If she comes to Beis Din and says 'My husband died. Permit me to remarry', we permit her and give her her Kesuvah;</p>
<p class="bas indent1"><span class="nm">(d)</span>If she says 'Give me the Kesuvah', we do not permit her even to remarry;</p>
<p class="bas indent2"><span class="nm">1.</span>This is because she intended to receive the Kesuvah.</p>
<p class="bas indent1"><span class="nm">(e)</span><span class="cl">Question #1:</span> If she says 'My husband died. Permit me to remarry and give me my Kesuvah', what is the law?</p>
<p class="bas indent2"><span class="nm">1.</span>Since she mentioned the Kesuvah, she intended for it (so we don't permit her at all)?</p>
<p class="bas indent2"><span class="nm">2.</span>Or, do we say that a person tells everything to Beis Din (but her primary intent was to remarry)?</p>
<p class="bas indent1"><span class="nm">(f)</span><span class="cl">Question #2:</span> If we say that a person tells everything to Beis Din, what is the law if she says 'My husband died. Give me my Kesuvah and permit me to remarry?</p>
<p class="bas indent2"><span class="nm">1.</span>Here, she certainly intended for the Kesuvah (since she mentioned it first)!</p>
<p class="bas indent2"><span class="nm">2.</span>Or, perhaps her primary intent was to remarry, just she didn't know for what she would be believed!</p>
<p class="bas indent1"><span class="nm">(g)</span>The question is unresolved.</p>
<p class="bas subject"><span class="nm">2)</span>WOMEN WHO ARE SUSPECTED TO LIE</p>
<p class="bas indent1"><span class="nm">(a)</span><span class="cl">(Mishnah):</span> All are believed to say that Leah's husband died except for: her mother-in-law; her mother-in-law's daughter; her Tzarah; the wife of her husband's brother; and her husband's daughter.</p>
<p class="bas indent2"><span class="nm">1.</span>These women are believed to bring her Get, since the signatures prove that it is valid.</p>
<p class="bas indent1"><span class="nm">(b)</span><span class="cl">(Gemara) Question:</span> Is her father-in-law's daughter believed?</p>
<p class="bas indent2"><span class="nm">1.</span><span class="cl">Question:</span> Why is (Sarah,) the daughter of Leah's mother-in-law, suspected to lie?</p>
<p class="bas indent3"><span class="nm">i.</span>If Sarah hates Leah because Sarah's mother does, this does not apply to the daughter of Leah's father-in-law;</p>
<p class="bas indent3"><span class="nm">ii.</span>If Sarah hates Leah because she thinks 'Leah is destined to enjoy my mother's money (Leah's husband, Sarah's brother, will inherit Sarah's mother), Leah's father-in-law's daughter similarly thinks 'Leah will enjoy my father's money'!</p>
<p class="bas indent1"><span class="nm">(c)</span><span class="cl">Answer (Beraisa):</span> All are believed, except for five women.</p>
<p class="bas indent2"><span class="nm">1.</span>If the father-in-law's daughter is not believed, there are six women!</p>
<p class="bas indent1"><span class="nm">(d)</span><span class="cl">Rejection:</span> If Sarah thinks 'Leah will enjoy my mother's money', the same applies to the father-in-law's daughter, so they are considered one case.</p>
<p class="bas indent1"><span class="nm">(e)</span><span class="cl">Contradiction (Beraisa):</span> All are believed except for seven women.</p>
<p class="bas indent1"><span class="nm">(f)</span><span class="cl">Answer:</span> That is like R. Yehudah:</p>
<p class="bas indent2"><span class="nm">1.</span><span class="cl">(Beraisa - R. Yehudah):</span> Also, her father's wife (if it is not her mother) and her daughter-in-law are not believed;</p>
<p class="bas indent2"><span class="nm">2.</span><span class="cl">Chachamim:</span> Since we taught her husband's daughter and her mother-in-law, we already know these cases (if Chanah might lie about Leah, Leah might lie about Chanah)!</p>
<p class="bas indent3"><span class="nm">i.</span>R. Yehudah holds that this is not obvious. Leah hates her daughter-in-law Esther because Esther is destined to enjoy Leah's money, but why should Esther hate her mother-in-law?</p>
<p class="bas indent3"><span class="nm">ii.</span>Leah hates her father's wife Miryam, because she thinks 'she is enjoying my mother's money' but why should Miryam hate her husband's daughter?</p>
<p class="bas indent2"><span class="nm">3.</span><span class="cl">Question:</span> If so, why does R. Yehudah say that also these two are not believed?</p>
<p class="bas indent2"><span class="nm">4.</span><span class="cl">Answer:</span> Esther hates her mother-in-law Leah, because Leah tells to her son (Esther's husband) everything that Sarah does;</p>
<p class="bas indent3"><span class="nm">i.</span>Miryam hates her husband's daughter (Leah) because Leah reveals to her father (Miryam's husband) all Miryam's doings.</p>
<p class="bas indent2"><span class="nm">5.</span>Chachamim hold that obviously they are not believed, for "As water reflects, so is the heart of one man to man" (hate is reciprocal).</p>
<p class="bas indent2"><span class="nm">6.</span>R. Yehudah says, the verse teaches that understanding in Torah is according to one's effort (alternatively - how well his Rebbi explains things).</p>
<p class="bas indent1"><span class="nm">(g)</span><span class="cl">Question (Rav Acha bar Avya):</span> If Sarah will become Leah's mother-in-law (i.e. after Leah does Yibum), is Sarah believed?</p>
<p class="bas indent2"><span class="nm">1.</span>Does Sarah anticipate that Leah will be widowed and fall to Yibum, and already hates her?</p>
<p class="bas bbbline">117b----------------------------------------117b</p>
<p class="bas indent1"><span class="nm">(h)</span><span class="cl">Answer (Mishnah):</span> If Leah says 'my husband died, and then my father-in-law', she may remarry and she receives her Kesuvah, but her mother-in-law (Sarah) may not remarry.</p>
<p class="bas indent2"><span class="nm">1.</span><span class="cl">Suggestion:</span> Sarah is forbidden because we suspect that neither man died. Leah lied to trick Sarah into remarrying so she will become forbidden to her husband and not bother Leah any more. (Even though now Leah is not (suffering like) a daughter-in-law of Sarah, after her husband returns she will again suffer. Ritva - this is like R. Yehudah, who says that a mother-in-law pains her daughter-in-law. We do not find that Chachamim argue and say that anticipating Yibum would not cause a woman to lie.)</p>
<p class="bas indent1"><span class="nm">(i)</span><span class="cl">Rejection:</span> This case is different, since Leah already felt pain from her mother-in-law (but she would not hate one who was not yet her mother-in-law).</p>
<p class="bas subject"><span class="nm">3)</span>CONTRADICTORY WITNESSES</p>
<p class="bas indent1"><span class="nm">(a)</span><span class="cl">(Mishnah):</span> If one witness said that Reuven died, and his wife remarried, and one witness came and said that he did not die, she does not leave (her husband);</p>
<p class="bas indent1"><span class="nm">(b)</span>If one witness said that he died, and two say that he did not, even if she remarried, she must leave;</p>
<p class="bas indent1"><span class="nm">(c)</span>If two witnesses say that he died and one says that he did not, even if she did not yet marry, she may marry.</p>
<p class="bas indent1"><span class="nm">(d)</span><span class="cl">(Gemara) Inference (from the Reisha):</span> She does not leave because she already remarried. Had she not yet remarried, she would be forbidden to remarry.</p>
<p class="bas indent1"><span class="nm">(e)</span><span class="cl">Question:</span> Ula taught that wherever the Torah believes one witness (e.g. the first, who says that Reuven died), he is like two witnesses!</p>
<p class="bas indent1"><span class="nm">(f)</span><span class="cl">Answer:</span> The Mishnah means that if one witness said that he died, and we permitted her to remarry, and one witness said that he did not die, she does not leave her Heter.</p>
<p class="bas indent1"><span class="nm">(g)</span><span class="cl">(Mishnah):</span> If one witness said that he died (and two say that he did not, she must leave).</p>
<p class="bas indent1"><span class="nm">(h)</span><span class="cl">Objection:</span> Obviously, one witness is not believed against two!</p>
<p class="bas indent1"><span class="nm">(i)</span><span class="cl">Answer:</span> The Mishnah discusses Pasul witnesses, like R. Nechemyah taught:</p>
<p class="bas indent2"><span class="nm">1.</span><span class="cl">(Beraisa - R. Nechemyah):</span> Wherever the Torah believed one witness, we follow the majority. Two women contradicting one man are like two men against one man.</p>
<p class="bas indent1"><span class="nm">(j)</span><span class="cl">Version #1:</span> (The Mishnah discusses two women who contradicted one man.)</p>
<p class="bas indent1"><span class="nm">(k)</span><span class="cl">Version #2:</span> If a valid witness came at first, even 100 women are like only one man (and she would remain permitted);</p>
<p class="bas indent2"><span class="nm">1.</span>The Mishnah discusses when the first witness was a woman.</p>
<p class="bas indent2"><span class="nm">2.</span>We must explain R. Nechemyah to say that wherever the Torah believed one witness, we follow the majority. Two women against one woman are like two men against one man;</p>
<p class="bas indent2"><span class="nm">3.</span>Two women against one man are like one man against one man.</p>
<p class="bas indent1"><span class="nm">(l)</span><span class="cl">(Mishnah):</span> If two witnesses say that he died ...</p>
<p class="bas indent1"><span class="nm">(m)</span><span class="cl">Question:</span> What does this teach?</p>
<p class="bas indent2"><span class="nm">1.</span>It need not teach about invalid witnesses, that we follow the majority like R. Nechemyah. The previous clause taught this!</p>
<p class="bas indent1"><span class="nm">(n)</span><span class="cl">Answer:</span> Indeed, it teaches this. One might have thought that we follow the majority only to be stringent, but not to be lenient. The Seifa teaches that this is not so.</p>
<p class="bas subject"><span class="nm">4)</span>A WOMAN IS NOT BELIEVED REGARDING HER <i>TZARAH</i></p>
<p class="bas indent1"><span class="nm">(a)</span><span class="cl">(Mishnah):</span> If Leah says that her husband died, and a Tzarah (Sarah) says that he did not, Leah may remarry and she receives her Kesuvah. Sarah may not remarry or receive her Kesuvah;</p>
<p class="bas indent1"><span class="nm">(b)</span>R. Meir says, if Leah says that he died and Sarah says that he was killed, since they contradict each other, they may not remarry;</p>
<p class="bas indent1"><span class="nm">(c)</span>R. Yehudah and R. Shimon say, since they admit that he is dead, they may remarry.</p>
<p class="bas indent1"><span class="nm">(d)</span>If one witness says that he died and one says that he did not die, or one woman says that he died and one woman says that he did not die, she may not remarry.</p>
