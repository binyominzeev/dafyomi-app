<p class="dedicationbox">SANHEDRIN 17 (10 Av) - Dedicated by Mrs. G. Kornfeld, in memory of her father, Reb Yisrael Shimon ben Shlomo ha'Levi Turkel. Isi Turkel, as he was known, loved Torah and worked to support it literally with his last ounce of strength. He passed away on 10 Av 5740. </p>

<p class="bas subject"><span class="nm">1)</span>A GREAT SANHEDRIN</p>
<p class="bas indent1"><span class="nm">(a)</span><span class="cl">(Mishnah):</span> The Great Sanhedrin has 71 judges.</p>
<p class="bas indent1"><span class="nm">(b)</span><span class="cl">Question:</span> Chachamim say that Moshe was appointed over them and is counted with them. What is their source?</p>
<p class="bas indent1"><span class="nm">(c)</span><span class="cl">Answer #1:</span> "V'Hisyatzvu Sham Imach" - they are with you, and you are with them.</p>
<p class="bas indent2"><span class="nm">1.</span>R. Yehudah says that "Imach" teaches that they may be with Moshe outside the Mishkan, but they may not enter it (alternatively - they should be with Moshe so that Shechinah will rest upon them).</p>
<p class="bas indent1"><span class="nm">(d)</span><span class="cl">Answer #2:</span> ("Imach" teaches like R. Yehudah.) Rather, Chachamim learn from "v'Nas'u Itecha b'Masa ha'Am" - they are with you, and you are with them.</p>
<p class="bas indent2"><span class="nm">1.</span>R. Yehudah says that "Itecha" teaches that they must be (of proper lineage and unblemished,) like Moshe.</p>
<p class="bas indent2"><span class="nm">2.</span>Chachamim learn that from "v'Hakel me'Alecha v'Nas'u Itach" (said about small Sanhedriyos). We learn about the Great Sanhedrin from a small Sanhedrin.</p>
<p class="bas indent1"><span class="nm">(e)</span><span class="cl">(Beraisa):</span> "Va'Yisha'aru Shnei Anashim ba'Machaneh" - some say that their lottery cards remained in the box.</p>
<p class="bas indent2"><span class="nm">1.</span>Hash-m told Moshe to gather 70 Zekenim. Moshe considered how to do this:</p>
<p class="bas indent3"><span class="nm">i.</span>If each Shevet would have six, this would be 72, which is too much;</p>
<p class="bas indent3"><span class="nm">ii.</span>If each Shevet would have five, this would be only 60;</p>
<p class="bas indent3"><span class="nm">iii.</span>If 10 Shevetim would have six and two would have five, there will be envy among them!</p>
<p class="bas indent2"><span class="nm">2.</span>Moshe took six Zekenim from each Shevet, and 72 cards. On 70 of them he wrote 'Zaken.' He left two blank. He put the cards in a box; each Zaken took a card.</p>
<p class="bas indent3"><span class="nm">i.</span>Whoever picked a card saying 'Zaken' would be on the Sanhedrin, and those who picked blank cards would not be. (Eldad and Medad never took their cards.)</p>
<p class="bas indent1"><span class="nm">(f)</span><span class="cl">Similarly:</span> "V'Lakachta Chameshes Chameshes Shekalim la'Gulgoles" (there were 273 more firstborn (Yisraelim) than Leviyim, they had to redeem themselves).</p>
<p class="bas indent2"><span class="nm">1.</span>Moshe was concerned, that any firstborn he approaches will say 'I correspond to a Levi. I need not redeem myself'!</p>
<p class="bas indent2"><span class="nm">2.</span>Moshe took 22,273 cards; on 22,000 he wrote 'Ben Levi', on 273 he wrote 'Chameshes Shekalim.' He put them in a box; each firstborn took a card.</p>
<p class="bas indent2"><span class="nm">3.</span>Whoever picked a card saying 'Ben Levi' was exempt. Whoever picked a card saying 'Chameshes Shekalim' needed to pay five Shekalim.</p>
<p class="bas indent1"><span class="nm">(g)</span>R. Shimon says, (Eldad and Medad) remained in the camp. They believed that they were not worthy of this greatness.</p>
<p class="bas indent2"><span class="nm">1.</span>Hash-m said, since you considered yourselves smaller than the others, I will make you greater than them!</p>
<p class="bas indent2"><span class="nm">2.</span>The others prophesized, but only temporarily. These two prophesized and did not cease.</p>
<p class="bas indent2"><span class="nm">3.</span><span class="cl">Question:</span> What prophecy did they have?</p>
<p class="bas indent2"><span class="nm">4.</span><span class="cl">Answer #1:</span> They prophesized that Moshe will die and Yehoshua will lead Yisrael into Eretz Yisrael.</p>
<p class="bas indent2"><span class="nm">5.</span><span class="cl">Answer #2 (Aba Chanin):</span> They prophesized about the Slav (the birds Hash-m provided in response to Yisrael's desire for meat).</p>
<p class="bas indent2"><span class="nm">6.</span><span class="cl">Answer #3 (Rav Nachman):</span> They prophesized about Gog and Magog (who will make war at the time of Moshi'ach) - "...Dibarti b'Yamim Kadmonim b'Yad Avadai... Shanim";</p>
<p class="bas indent3"><span class="nm">i.</span>We can read "Shanim" like 'Shnayim'.</p>
<p class="bas indent3"><span class="nm">ii.</span>The only time we find two Nevi'im with the same prophecy was Eldad and Medad.</p>
<p class="bas indent1"><span class="nm">(h)</span><span class="cl">Question:</span> (R. Shimon said that the others prophesized, but only temporarily.) What is his source?</p>
<p class="bas indent2"><span class="nm">1.</span><span class="cl">Suggestion:</span> "Va'Yisnabe'u v'Lo Yasafu."</p>
<p class="bas indent2"><span class="nm">2.</span><span class="cl">Rejection:</span> If so, we should likewise expound "Kol Gadol v'Lo Yasaf" (when we heard Hash-m on Sinai), that the voice ceased!</p>
<p class="bas indent3"><span class="nm">i.</span>Rather, it means, it <i>did not</i> cease.</p>
<p class="bas indent1"><span class="nm">(i)</span><span class="cl">Answer:</span> Regarding the other 70, it says "va'Yisnabe'u" (past tense). Regarding Eldad and Medad, it says "Misnabe'im" - they continue to prophesize.</p>
<p class="bas indent1"><span class="nm">(j)</span><span class="cl">Question:</span> Granted, according to the opinion that they prophesized that Moshe will die and Yehoshua will lead Yisrael into Eretz Yisrael, we understand why Yehoshua said "Adoni Moshe Kela'em";</p>
<p class="bas indent2"><span class="nm">1.</span>According to the other two opinions, why was Yehoshua upset?</p>
<p class="bas indent1"><span class="nm">(k)</span><span class="cl">Answer:</span> It was improper to prophesize in front of Moshe, just like a Talmid may not decide Halachah in front of his Rebbi.</p>
<p class="bas indent1"><span class="nm">(l)</span><span class="cl">Question:</span> According to the other two opinions, we understand why Moshe said "Mi Yiten (all of Yisrael should have prophecy like them!)";</p>
<p class="bas indent2"><span class="nm">1.</span>If they prophesized about Moshe's death, why was he happy?</p>
<p class="bas indent1"><span class="nm">(m)</span><span class="cl">Answer:</span> He only heard that they were prophesizing. He did not hear the prophecy.</p>
<p class="bas indent1"><span class="nm">(n)</span><span class="cl">Question:</span> (Yehoshua suggested to Moshe) "Kela'em". What does this mean?</p>
<p class="bas indent1"><span class="nm">(o)</span><span class="cl">Answer:</span> Impose the needs of the Tzibur on them. They will (become sad and) cease (to prophesize).</p>
<p class="bas subject"><span class="nm">2)</span>A SMALL SANHEDRIN</p>
<p class="bas indent1"><span class="nm">(a)</span><span class="cl">(Mishnah):</span> (A small Sanhedrin has 23... the Torah says that 10 are Mechayev, and 10 are Mezakeh.) Question: How do we learn another three? (The Mishnah answered, a majority of two is needed to convict, and we do not make a Beis Din with an even number of judges, so we add one more.)</p>
<p class="bas indent1"><span class="nm">(b)</span><span class="cl">Question:</span> Now that there are 23, we cannot have a majority of exactly two!</p>
<p class="bas indent2"><span class="nm">1.</span>If 12 are Mechayev, this is only one more than the Mezakim!</p>
<p class="bas indent2"><span class="nm">2.</span>If 13 are Mechayev, this is three more than the Mezakim!</p>
<p class="bas indent1"><span class="nm">(c)</span><span class="cl">Answer (R. Avahu):</span> We can find a majority of exactly two when we add judges (because one of them could not decide), even according to Chachamim. Alternatively, we find this on the Great Sanhedrin, which has 70 judges according to R. Yehudah.</p>
<p class="bas indent1"><span class="nm">(d)</span><span class="cl">(R. Avahu):</span> When we add judges, we can make a Beis Din with an even number of judges l'Chatchilah.</p>
<p class="bas indent1"><span class="nm">(e)</span><span class="cl">Question:</span> This is obvious! (If one does not know, and the Beis Din has an even number of judges, an odd number of judges will vote, like we want!)</p>
<p class="bas indent1"><span class="nm">(f)</span><span class="cl">Answer:</span> One might have thought that we count the indecisive judge among the judges, for if he later decides (and explains his previous indecision) he may vote;</p>
<p class="bas indent2"><span class="nm">1.</span>R. Avahu teaches that this is not so. We do not count the indecisive judge among the judges, even if he later gives a reason.</p>
<p class="bas indent1"><span class="nm">(g)</span><span class="cl">(Rav Kahana):</span> If all the judges (initially) say that he is Chayav, we exempt him.</p>
<p class="bas indent1"><span class="nm">(h)</span><span class="cl">Question:</span> What is the reason?</p>
<p class="bas indent1"><span class="nm">(i)</span><span class="cl">Answer:</span> We are not Mechayev Misah on the same day, because the judges must spend the night looking for Zechus (a reason to acquit);</p>
<p class="bas indent2"><span class="nm">1.</span>Since all said that he is Chayav, they will not try hard enough to find Zechus.</p>
<p class="bas indent1"><span class="nm">(j)</span><span class="cl">(R. Yochanan):</span> We put on a Sanhedrin only people of great stature and appearance, who are Chachamim, old, understand witchcraft, and know all 70 languages, so that Beis Din will not need to hear testimony through an interpreter.</p>
<p class="bas indent1"><span class="nm">(k)</span><span class="cl">(Rav Yehudah):</span> We put on a Sanhedrin only a Chacham clever enough to prove that the Torah says that a Sheretz (rodent) is Tahor.</p>
<p class="bas indent1"><span class="nm">(l)</span><span class="cl">(Rav):</span> I can show that it is Tahor. A snake kills people, and increases Tum'ah, yet it is Tahor. A Sheretz does not kill people and increase Tum'ah, all the more so it is Tahor!</p>
<p class="bas bbbline">17b----------------------------------------17b</p>
<p class="bas indent1"><span class="nm">(m)</span><span class="cl">Rejection:</span> This is not a Kal va'Chomer. Also thorns kill, but this is no reason to say that they are Tamei!</p>
<p class="bas indent1"><span class="nm">(n)</span><span class="cl">Version #1 - Rambam - (Rav Yehudah):</span> We do not establish a Sanhedrin in a city if it does not have two Chachamim who can speak (teach every subject in Torah), one must be able to listen and respond.</p>
<p class="bas indent1"><span class="nm">(o)</span><span class="cl">Version #2 - Rashi - (Rav Yehudah):</span> We do not establish a Sanhedrin unless it will have two people who can speak (every language) and a third who understands it if he hears it. (end of Version #2)</p>
<p class="bas indent2"><span class="nm">1.</span>In Beitar, there were three who could speak. In Yavneh, there were four - R. Eliezer, R. Yehoshua, R. Akiva and Shimon ha'Temani (a Talmid who sat in front of the Sanhedrin).</p>
<p class="bas indent1"><span class="nm">(p)</span><span class="cl">Question (Beraisa):</span> If three people in the city can speak, it is qualified to have a Sanhedrin. Four is the highest level.</p>
<p class="bas indent1"><span class="nm">(q)</span><span class="cl">Answer:</span> Rav Yehudah holds like the Tana of the following Beraisa.</p>
<p class="bas indent2"><span class="nm">1.</span><span class="cl">(Beraisa):</span> If two people in the city can speak, it is qualified to have a Sanhedrin. Three is the highest level.</p>

<p class="bas indent2"><span class="nm">2.</span><span class="cl">Version #2 (Rav Nachman bar Yitzchak):</span> There were those four, and also Shimon ha'Temani.</p>
<p class="bas indent2"><span class="nm">3.</span>'Raboseinu in Bavel' refers to Rav and Shmuel. 'Raboseinu in Eretz Yisrael' refers to R. Aba;</p>

<p class="bas indent1"><span class="nm">(a)</span><span class="cl">(Mishnah) Question:</span> How many people must be in a city to qualify it to have a Sanhedrin? One hundred and twenty...</p>
<p class="bas indent1"><span class="nm">(b)</span><span class="cl">Question:</span> What is the reason for 120?</p>
<p class="bas indent1"><span class="nm">(c)</span><span class="cl">Answer:</span> This suffices to have 23 on the Sanhedrin, three rows of 23 Talmidim (each), 10 people who are always in the Beis ha'Keneses, two scribes (to write the claims of each side), two Sheluchim of the Beis Din, two litigants, two witnesses, two Mezimim (witnesses to say that the witnesses were not where they claimed to see the testimony), two Mezimim of the Mezimim, and six more people necessary to make it proper for Chachamim to live there;</p>
<p class="bas indent2"><span class="nm">1.</span><span class="cl">(Beraisa):</span> A Chachamim should only live in a city with these 10 things: a Beis Din that lashes and punishes, a Tzedakah box for which two people collect and three people distribute, a Beis ha'Keneses, a bathhouse, a privy, a doctor, a bloodletter, a scribe, (a butcher; Rashi's text deletes this, and he counts the collection and distribution of Tzedakah as two matters,) and one who teaches children;</p>
