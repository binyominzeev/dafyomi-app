<div class="subject"><span class="nm">1)</span><p>MUMIM OF THE EYES</p></div>
<div class="indent1"><span class="nm">(a)</span><p><span class="cl">(Mishnah):</span> Both of his eyes are above; both are below...  (these are Pesulim).</p></div>
<div class="indent1"><span class="nm">(b)</span><p><span class="cl">Question:</span> What does this mean?</p></div>
<div class="indent2"><span class="nm">1.</span><p><span class="cl">Suggestion:</span> "His eyes are above" means that (when his eyes are straight,) he sees above. "His eyes are below" means that he sees below. "One is above and one is below" means, one eye sees above and one sees below.</p></div>
<div class="indent2"><span class="nm">2.</span><p><span class="cl">Rejection:</span> If so, this (third) case is identical to the fourth "he can see the first and second floors at the same time"!</p></div>
<div class="indent1"><span class="nm">(c)</span><p><span class="cl">Answer:</span> Rather, "his eyes are above (or below)" means that his eyes are higher (or lower) on his face than is normal;</p></div>
<div class="indent2"><span class="nm">1.</span><p>Even if his eyes are in the usual place, if he sees the first and second floors at the same time; he is Pasul.</p></div>
<div class="indent1"><span class="nm">(d)</span><p><span class="cl">Question:</span> What is the source of this?</p></div>
<div class="indent1"><span class="nm">(e)</span><p><span class="cl">Answer (Beraisa):</span> "B'Eino" (is extra. This) includes any abnormality in the eye:</p></div>
<div class="indent2"><span class="nm">1.</span><p>Both eyes are above, or both are below, or one is above and one is below, or he can see the first and second floors at the same time, or if he talks with Reuven (and looks at him) and Shimon says "He is looking at me."</p></div>
<div class="indent1"><span class="nm">(f)</span><p><span class="cl">(Beraisa):</span> "Iver" refers to one who is blind in one or both eyes;</p></div>
<div class="indent2"><span class="nm">1.</span><p><span class="cl">Question:</span> What is the source for Chavarvar and a constant drip?</p></div>
<div class="indent2"><span class="nm">2.</span><p><span class="cl">Answer:</span> It says "Ish Iver."</p></div>
<div class="indent1"><span class="nm">(g)</span><p><span class="cl">Question (Rava):</span> Why must the Torah say "Ish Iver... Dak Oh Tevalul b'Eino"?</p></div>
<div class="indent1"><span class="nm">(h)</span><p><span class="cl">Answer:</span> All of these are needed:</p></div>
<div class="indent2"><span class="nm">1.</span><p>Had it said only "Iver," we would be Posel only one who lacks an eye, but not Chavarvar and a constant drip, for he has two eyes. Therefore, it says "Ish";</p></div>
<div class="indent2"><span class="nm">2.</span><p>Had it added only "Ish," we would be Posel only one who cannot see at all, but not one whose vision is impaired. Therefore, it says "Dak";</p></div>
<div class="indent2"><span class="nm">3.</span><p>Had it added only "Dak," we would be Posel only one whose vision is impaired, but not if the a protrusion of white enters the black. (The vision is not impaired.) Therefore, it says "Tevalul";</p></div>
<div class="indent2"><span class="nm">4.</span><p>Had it added only "Tevalul," we would Posel only a protrusion into the black, but not a mere abnormality (of their location, or the ability to see different places at once) - therefore, it says "b'Eino."</p></div>
<div class="indent1"><span class="nm">(i)</span><p><span class="cl">Conclusion (Rava):</span> Anyone who cannot see at all is Pasul due to "Ish";</p></div>
<div class="indent2"><span class="nm">1.</span><p>Anyone whose vision is impaired is Pasul due to "Dak". Any protrusion into the black is Pasul due to "Tevalul". Any abnormality is Pasul due to "b'Eino."</p></div>
<div class="indent1"><span class="nm">(j)</span><p><span class="cl">(Mishnah):</span> Sachei Shemesh, (Zagdan,... )</p></div>
<div class="indent1"><span class="nm">(k)</span><p><span class="cl">(Rav Yosef):</span> The text should say "Sanei Shemesh" (one who hates sunlight. He cannot look where the sun shines.)</p></div>
<div class="indent1"><span class="nm">(l)</span><p>To illustrate "Zagdiyan," Rav Huna said "one of my eyes, and one of his" (Rav Yehudah was sitting in front of him); Rav Yehudah was upset. (Rashi - Rav Huna's eyes were normal, Rav Yehudah's eyes were not; Tosfos - Rav Yehudah's eyes were understandably bigger than Rav Huna's, for Rav Yehudah was much taller.)</p></div>
<div class="indent1"><span class="nm">(m)</span><p><span class="cl">Question (Beraisa):</span> "Shechevna" is one whose eyebrows rest on his eyes;</p></div>
<div class="indent2"><span class="nm">1.</span><p>Zagdum is when one eyebrow is black, and the other is white.</p></div>
<div class="indent1"><span class="nm">(n)</span><p><span class="cl">Answer:</span> The Tana calls any difference between a pair (that should be identical) "Zagdum."</p></div>
<div class="indent1"><span class="nm">(o)</span><p><span class="cl">(Mishnah):</span> Tziran.</p></div>
<div class="indent1"><span class="nm">(p)</span><p><span class="cl">(Beraisa):</span> (The following are Pesulim:)</p></div>
<div class="indent2"><span class="nm">1.</span><p>(Tziran -) his eyes are round; Tziraniyos (Rashi - they are very round; R. Gershom - the socket is round);</p></div>
<div class="indent2"><span class="nm">2.</span><p>His eyes tear, drip, or constantly drip.</p></div>
<div class="indent1"><span class="nm">(q)</span><p><span class="cl">(Beraisa):</span> (The following are Pesulim:)</p></div>
<div class="indent2"><span class="nm">1.</span><p>Zavir - his eyes constantly move (alternatively - twitch);</p></div>
<div class="indent2"><span class="nm">2.</span><p>Lufin - his eyelashes are very long;</p></div>
<div class="indent2"><span class="nm">3.</span><p>Tamir - he has no eyelashes.</p></div>
<div class="indent1"><span class="nm">(r)</span><p><span class="cl">Question:</span> This Beraisa discusses (proper) Mumim. Our Mishnah disqualifies one without eyelashes only due to Mar'is ha'Ayin!</p></div>
<div class="indent1"><span class="nm">(s)</span><p><span class="cl">Answer:</span> The Mishnah discusses when there is a remnant of the hairs. The Beraisa discusses when there is no remnant.</p></div>
<div class="subject"><span class="nm">2)</span><p>FACIAL MUMIM</p></div>
<div class="indent1"><span class="nm">(a)</span><p><span class="cl">(Mishnah):</span> The following are Pesulim:</p></div>
<div class="indent2"><span class="nm">1.</span><p>His eyes are as big as a calf's eyes, or (see Insights) as small as a goose's eyes;</p></div>
<div class="indent2"><span class="nm">2.</span><p>His body is (disproportionately) big compared to his limbs (arms and legs), or too small;</p></div>
<div class="indent2"><span class="nm">3.</span><p>His nose is big compared to his limbs, or too small.</p></div>
<div class="indent2"><span class="nm">4.</span><p>Tzome'a - his ears are too small;</p></div>
<div class="indent2"><span class="nm">5.</span><p>Tzomem - his ears are spongy (shrivelled and closed).</p></div>
<div class="indent1"><span class="nm">(b)</span><p>If the upper jaw extends past the lower jaw, or vice-versa, it is a Mum;</p></div>
<div class="indent1"><span class="nm">(c)</span><p>If his teeth fell out, he is Pasul due to Mar'is ha'Ayin.</p></div>
<div class="indent1"><span class="nm">(d)</span><p><span class="cl">(Gemara - Rav):</span> Moshe was 10 Amos tall - "va'Yifros Es ha'Ohel Al ha'Mishkan";</p></div>
<div class="indent2"><span class="nm">1.</span><p>To spread the curtains over the boards, he had to be as tall as them, i.e. 10 Amos.</p></div>
<div class="indent1"><span class="nm">(e)</span><p><span class="cl">Question (Rav Simi):</span> If so, he was a Ba'al Mum!</p></div>
<div class="indent2"><span class="nm">1.</span><p><span class="cl">(Mishnah):</span> His body is big compared to his limbs. (A normal person's shoulder is three times as tall as his Amah (lower arm). Rav Simi understood that Moshe's height was 10 times his own (normal sized) Amah.)</p></div>
<div class="indent1"><span class="nm">(f)</span><p><span class="cl">Answer (Rav):</span> Moshe's height was 10 (standard) Amos. (Surely, this was three times his own Amah.)</p></div>
<div class="indent1"><span class="nm">(g)</span><p><span class="cl">(Mishnah):</span> His nose is big (compared to his limbs, or too small).</p></div>
<div class="indent1"><span class="nm">(h)</span><p><span class="cl">Version #1 - Rambam - (Beraisa):</span> It should be the length of his pinky.</p></div>
<div class="indent1"><span class="nm">(i)</span><p><span class="cl">Version #2 - Rashi - (Beraisa):</span> If it is too big or small (compared to noses of other people of his size), and the excess or deficit is the width of his pinky (he is Pasul).</p></div>
<div class="indent1"><span class="nm">(j)</span><p><span class="cl">(Mishnah):</span> Tzimem and Tzome'a...</p></div>
<div class="indent1"><span class="nm">(k)</span><p><span class="cl">(Beraisa):</span> Also Tzime'ach is Pasul.</p></div>
<div class="indent2"><span class="nm">1.</span><p>Rabanan did not know what this is. They heard a merchant announce "who wants Tzime'ach?" He was selling a goat.</p></div>
<div class="indent2"><span class="nm">2.</span><p>We learn that Tzime'ach refers to long droopy ears.</p></div>
<div class="subject"><span class="nm">3)</span><p>AN ANIMAL MISSING HORNS</p></div>
<div class="indent1"><span class="nm">(a)</span><p><span class="cl">(Rav Chisda):</span> If a goat lacks horns, or if a ewe has horns, this does not disqualify it for a Korban.</p></div>
<div class="indent1"><span class="nm">(b)</span><p><span class="cl">Support (Beraisa):</span> The following resemble Mumim but are not Mumim. Such a Korban may be offered on the Mizbe'ach, but it may not be slaughtered outside;</p></div>
<div class="indent2"><span class="nm">1.</span><p>If a goat lacks horns, or if a ewe has horns;</p></div>
<div class="indent2"><span class="nm">2.</span><p>Tzime'ach, Tzimem or Tzome'a. (We must say that the Mishnah disqualified such Kohanim only because they are unlike Zera Aharon.)</p></div>
<div class="indent1"><span class="nm">(c)</span><p><span class="cl">(Rav Chisda):</span> If a Korban's horns were removed with the inner bone, it is Pasul, but it may not be redeemed (until it gets a proper Mum);</p></div>
<div class="indent2"><span class="nm">1.</span><p>If its hooves were removed with the inner bone, it is Pasul, and it may be redeemed.</p></div>
<div class="indent1"><span class="nm">(d)</span><p><span class="cl">Question (Beraisa):</span> If its horns or hooves were removed with the inner bone, it is Pasul, and it may be redeemed.</p></div>
<div class="indent1"><span class="nm">(e)</span><p><span class="cl">Answer:</span> The Beraisa discusses when they were totally uprooted, and there is no remnant. Rav Chisda discusses when they were cut, and the roots remain.</p></div>
<div class="indent1"><span class="nm">(f)</span><p><span class="cl">Question:</span> If the roots remain it is Kosher!</p></div>
<div class="indent2"><span class="nm">1.</span><p><span class="cl">(Mishnah):</span> If the horns or hooves of a Parah Adumah were black (this disqualifies it), they may be cut.</p></div>
<div class="indent1"><span class="nm">(g)</span><p><span class="cl">Answer (Ze'iri):</span> If the outermost part of the horns or hooves are cut, without cutting the inner bone, it is Kosher.</p></div>

<div class="indent1"><span class="nm">(a)</span><p><span class="cl">(Mishnah):</span> The following are Pasul:</p></div>

(Rashi - it is improper for a Chacham to eat or drink in public. Tosfos - even if one does not drink water in public (only water is forbidden, people do not drink it together), he may pass water in public. Iyun Yakov - even though one may drink urine for a cure, one may not do so in public.)</p></div>

<div class="indent2"><span class="nm">1.</span><p>A case occurred in which a man needed to urinate, but he delayed. His stomach swelled.</p></div>
<div class="indent1"><span class="nm">(d)</span><p>Once, Shmuel needed to urinate while he was teaching. They spread a sheet to give him privacy.</p></div>

<div class="indent2"><span class="nm">1.</span><p>You were able to urinate with privacy, but your Talmidim would not be able to (while you are teaching). Perhaps they will endanger themselves!</p></div>
<div class="indent1"><span class="nm">(f)</span><p>Mar bar Rav Ashi was crossing a bridge. He needed to urinate. They told him that his mother-in-law was coming; he said, even if he had to urinate in her ear (Maharsha - right next to her), he would do so and not endanger himself.</p></div>
<div class="indent1"><span class="nm">(g)</span><p><span class="cl">Question:</span> The Beraisa said that once, a man's stomach swelled because he needed to urinate, but he delayed. Perhaps it swelled because he drank a leech!</p></div>

<div class="indent1"><span class="nm">(i)</span><p><span class="cl">(Beraisa):</span> There are two holes in the Ever. One of them is for urine, and the other is for semen. They are separated by the thickness of a garlic peel;</p></div>

<div class="indent1"><span class="nm">(m)</span><p><span class="cl">(Rav Papa):</span> (In Bavel, even today, after the Churban,) one should not urinate in a urinal (which people empty into the river) or on a hard place (where it will not be absorbed, and will flow into the river);</p></div>
<div class="indent2"><span class="nm">1.</span><p><span class="cl">(R. Chani):</span> The inclined places of Bavel lead water to Ein Eitam (a spring that runs through the Mikdash. The Kohen Gadol would immerse in it on Yom Kipur. R. Gershom - people in Eretz Yisrael drink from it.)</p></div>
