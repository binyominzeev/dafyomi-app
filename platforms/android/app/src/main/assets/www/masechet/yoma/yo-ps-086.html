<div class="indent1"><span class="nm">(a)</span><p><span class="cl">Question (on R. Yehudah):</span> The Berasia teaches a cut-off - "Lo Sisa" and those lesser are atoned through Teshuvah (presumably this refers to all Lavin without "Lo Yenakeh Hash-m")!?</p></div>
<div class="indent1"><span class="nm">(b)</span><p><span class="cl">Answer:</span> No, those comparable to "Lo Sisa" refers to all Lo Sa'aseh with Malkos (but that those with less than Malkos <i>would</i> be atoned with Teshuvah alone, as per R. Yehudah).</p></div>
<div class="indent1"><span class="nm">(c)</span><p><span class="cl">Question:</span> The Beraisa explaining "ve'Nakeh" and "Lo YeNakeh" implies that Lavin <i>are</i> atoned by Teshuvah alone!?</p></div>
<div class="indent1"><span class="nm">(d)</span><p><span class="cl">Answer:</span> It is a Machlokes Tana'im (as cited).</p></div>
<div class="indent1"><span class="nm">(e)</span><p><span class="cl">Question:</span> How do we know that "veNakeh" refers to Teshuvah alone?</p></div>
<div class="indent1"><span class="nm">(f)</span><p><span class="cl">Answer:</span> From the Beraisa of R. Elazar (who resolves the apparent contradiction between "veNakeh" and "Lo Yenakeh" - "ve'Nakeh" refers to someone who has done Teshuvah, and "Lo Yenakeh" to someone who has not).</p></div>
<div class="subject"><span class="nm">2)</span><p>TESHUVAH</p></div>
<div class="indent1"><span class="nm">(a)</span><p>R. Elazar b. Azaryah (citing R. Yishmael) taught there are only three categories (unlike the assumption of R. Masya b. Charash) as Teshuvah is not an atonement, it is a prerequisite for the other three.</p></div>
<div class="indent2"><span class="nm">1.</span><p>One who violates an Asei and does Teshuvah is atoned at that time (proof text).</p></div>
<div class="indent2"><span class="nm">2.</span><p>One who violates a Lo Sa'aseh and an Asei, Teshuvah suspends the affliction and Yom Kipur atones (text).</p></div>
<div class="indent2"><span class="nm">3.</span><p>One who violates a Kareis or Misas Beis Din, his Teshuvah, together with Yom Kipur, suspend the sentence and affliction brings atonement (text).</p></div>
<div class="indent2"><span class="nm">4.</span><p>For Chilul Hash-m, all of the above only suspend, while death is needed to atone (text).</p></div>
<div class="subject"><span class="nm">3)</span><p>CHILUL HASH-M</p></div>
<div class="indent1"><span class="nm">(a)</span><p><span class="cl">Question:</span> What defines Chilul Hash-m?</p></div>
<div class="indent1"><span class="nm">(b)</span><p><span class="cl">Answer (Rav):</span> If I were to take meat from the butcher and not pay immediately (thus causing the merchant to consider me a thief and will come to treat Gezel lightly).</p></div>
<div class="indent2"><span class="nm">1.</span><p><span class="cl">(Abaye):</span> That is only a Chilul Hash-m in a locale where it is customary for people to pay the merchants without being billed by the merchant, but if the merchant customarily collects his debts, there is no problem following local custom.</p></div>
<div class="indent2"><span class="nm">2.</span><p><span class="cl">(Ravina):</span> My locale is one where the merchants collect.</p></div>
<div class="indent2"><span class="nm">3.</span><p>Abaye, when purchasing an item from partners, would give half the money to each (rather than all the money to one) and call them to reckon his bill, to be above the suspicion (on the part of the second) that he had not paid.</p></div>
<div class="indent1"><span class="nm">(c)</span><p><span class="cl">Answer (R. Yochanan):</span> If I were to walk four Amos without Torah and Tefilin (leading people to treat these lightly).</p></div>
<div class="indent1"><span class="nm">(d)</span><p><span class="cl">Answer (Yitzhok D'Vei R. Yanai):</span> One whose reputation causes embarrassment to his friends.</p></div>
<div class="indent1"><span class="nm">(e)</span><p><span class="cl">Answer (R. Nachman b. Yitzhok):</span> One whose friends must add to his name, 'May Hash-m forgive him... '.</p></div>
<div class="indent1"><span class="nm">(f)</span><p><span class="cl">Answer (Abaye):</span> As the Beraisa describes the fulfillment of Kidush Hash-m (people praising the gentle honest manner of those who study Torah) and its opposite (decrying the absence of these good traits in one who studies Torah).</p></div>
<div class="subject"><span class="nm">4)</span><p>TESHUVAH</p></div>
<div class="indent1"><span class="nm">(a)</span><p>Teshuvah causes healing in the world (proof text).</p></div>
<div class="indent1"><span class="nm">(b)</span><p><span class="cl">Question (R. Chama b'R. Chanina):</span> One Pasuk indicates that Teshuvah causes the sinner to be viewed, retroactively, as only a wild child (not a sinner) while another Pasuk sees Teshuvah as healing that which was ill?</p></div>
<div class="indent1"><span class="nm">(c)</span><p><span class="cl">Answer:</span> Teshuvah out of love brings retroactive revision, while Teshuvah out of fear only heals from then on.</p></div>
<div class="indent1"><span class="nm">(d)</span><p><span class="cl">Question (R. Yehudah):</span> One Pasuk calls to the penitent as a son; the other calls to him as a servant?</p></div>
<div class="indent1"><span class="nm">(e)</span><p><span class="cl">Answer:</span> Teshuvah is pleasant when it is out of love or fear; while it will come about through affliction when it is forced upon Yisrael by the Master, Hash-m.</p></div>
<div class="indent1"><span class="nm">(f)</span><p>(R. Levi):Teshuvah reaches Hash-m's Throne (proof text).</p></div>
<div class="bbbline">86b----------------------------------------86b</p></div>
<div class="indent1"><span class="nm">(g)</span><p><span class="cl">(R. Yochanan):</span> Teshuvah is so great that it (so to speak) overrides a Lo Sa'Asei in the Torah (the Lav of taking back one's divorced wife after marriage to another man, as indicated in the proof text).</p></div>
<div class="indent1"><span class="nm">(h)</span><p><span class="cl">(R. Yonasan):</span> Teshuvah brings the redemption (proof text).</p></div>
<div class="indent1"><span class="nm">(i)</span><p><span class="cl">(Resh Lakish):</span> Teshuvah causes Zedonos to be Shegagos (text).</p></div>
<div class="indent2"><span class="nm">1.</span><p><span class="cl">Question:</span> But Resh Lakish has taught that Zedonos become Zechuyos (proof text)!?</p></div>
<div class="indent2"><span class="nm">2.</span><p><span class="cl">Answer:</span> One speaks of Teshuvah miYira'ah (they become Shegagos) and one speaks MiAhavah (become Zechuyos).</p></div>
<div class="indent1"><span class="nm">(j)</span><p><span class="cl">(R. Shmuel b. Nachmani):</span> Teshuvah lengthens one's years (proof text).</p></div>
<div class="indent1"><span class="nm">(k)</span><p><span class="cl">(R. Yitzhok):</span> Compare the ways of man with those of Hash-m.</p></div>
<div class="indent2"><span class="nm">1.</span><p>Someone who sins against his fellow must wonder if the other will be appeased at all, and if so, at what cost.</p></div>
<div class="indent2"><span class="nm">2.</span><p>One who transgresses the Will of Hash-m need only approach Him with words (which will be credited as if he brought the finest Korban), and he will not only be received, but appreciated!</p></div>
<div class="indent1"><span class="nm">(l)</span><p><span class="cl">(R. Meir in the Beraisa):</span> Teshuvah on an individual brings atonement for the entire world (proof text).</p></div>
<div class="subject"><span class="nm">5)</span><p>THE BA'AL TESHUVAH</p></div>
<div class="indent1"><span class="nm">(a)</span><p><span class="cl">Question:</span> What constitutes a Ba'al Teshuvah?</p></div>
<div class="indent1"><span class="nm">(b)</span><p><span class="cl">Answer (R. Yehudah):</span> One who avoids transgressing the same sin on another two occasions (e.g. with the same woman, during the same period of his life, in the same location).</p></div>
<div class="indent1"><span class="nm">(c)</span><p><span class="cl">Question (R. Yehudah, citing Rav):</span> One Pasuk praises the one who conceals his sin, and another does the opposite!?</p></div>
<div class="indent1"><span class="nm">(d)</span><p><span class="cl">Answer (Rav):</span> One should confess (and suffer embarrassment) from public Aveiros, but should not publicize private ones.</p></div>
<div class="indent1"><span class="nm">(e)</span><p><span class="cl">Answer (R. Zutra b. Tuvyah citing R. Nachman):</span> One should openly confess his sins against his fellow, but conceal those against Hash-m.</p></div>
<div class="indent1"><span class="nm">(f)</span><p><span class="cl">(R. Yosi b. Yehudah):</span> Hash-m forgives the same sin performed (by Klal Yisrael as well as by an individual) three times, but not four (two proof texts are needed to make the point by both the Klal and the Yachid).</p></div>
<div class="subject"><span class="nm">6)</span><p>VIDUI</p></div>
<div class="indent1"><span class="nm">(a)</span><p><span class="cl">(Tana Kama):</span> Aveiros which one confessed one Yom Kipur should not be confessed on the next, (unless the Aveirah was repeated) for doing so is like returning to the filth which he left behind (proof text).</p></div>
<div class="indent1"><span class="nm">(b)</span><p><span class="cl">(R. Eliezer b. Ya'akov):</span> One should keep one's sins before himself always (proof text).</p></div>
<div class="indent2"><span class="nm">1.</span><p><span class="cl">Question:</span> How will R. Eliezer explain the Tana Kama's proof text?</p></div>
<div class="indent2"><span class="nm">2.</span><p><span class="cl">Answer:</span> He learns from there Rav Huna's slogan - that once a person sins twice, it begins to <i>appear</i> to him as if the sin was permitted.</p></div>
<div class="indent1"><span class="nm">(c)</span><p><span class="cl">(R. Yehudah b. Bava):</span> One must specify the Aveirah when confessing (proof text).</p></div>
<div class="indent1"><span class="nm">(d)</span><p><span class="cl">(R. Akiva):</span> It is unnecessary to specify.</p></div>
<div class="indent2"><span class="nm">1.</span><p><span class="cl">Question:</span> How will R. Akiva understand the proof text from Moshe (confessing the sin of the people)?</p></div>
<div class="indent2"><span class="nm">2.</span><p><span class="cl">Answer:</span> He learns R. Yanai's teaching, that Moshe attempted to reduce the people's guilt.</p></div>
<div class="indent1"><span class="nm">(e)</span><p>Our faithful leaders, Moshe Rabeinu and David ha'Melech, differed on their desire to have their transgression mentioned.</p></div>
<div class="indent2"><span class="nm">1.</span><p>David ha'Melech asked Hash-m to <i>hide</i> his sin.</p></div>
<div class="indent2"><span class="nm">2.</span><p>Moshe asked Hash-m to <i>publicize</i> his.</p></div>
<div class="indent2"><span class="nm">3.</span><p>As in the Mashal cited, Moshe wanted all to know the difference between the sin which prevented him from entering Eretz Yisrael and that which prevented Yisrael from entering (Meraglim).</p></div>
<div class="indent1"><span class="nm">(f)</span><p>It is proper to publicize the identity of Chanafim (as in the proof text, to prevent the Chilul Hash-m which results from people learning from the actions of these evildoers posing as Tzadikim and also questioning the punishment which comes to them).</p></div>
<div class="indent1"><span class="nm">(g)</span><p>The Teshuvah of total Resha'im delays their punishment even if it has already been sealed.</p></div>
<div class="indent1"><span class="nm">(h)</span><p>The tranquil life of Resha'im is an obstacle (that impedes the world's progress), because it affords them time to devise their evil plans.</p></div>
<div class="indent1"><span class="nm">(i)</span><p>Authority buries its incumbents.</p></div>
<div class="indent1"><span class="nm">(j)</span><p>One leaves the world as he came into it (were that a person could leave it as free of sin).</p></div>
<div class="indent1"><span class="nm">(k)</span><p>Before going out to judge, borh Rav and Rava used to say 'Of one's own freewill one goes to one's death (referring to the heavy responsibility of judging), even though one gains nothing in the process. Would that he would return home (blameless) as he left.'</p></div>
