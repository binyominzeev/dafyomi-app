<div class="subject"><span class="nm">1)</span><p>THE SHECHINAH AND TUM'AH</p></div>
<div class="indent1"><span class="nm">(a)</span><p>We are taught that even when we are Tamei the Shechinah is with us.</p></div>
<div class="indent1"><span class="nm">(b)</span><p>The blasphemer challenged R. Chanina by calling us Tamei (based on the Pasuk indicating that such will be the case in the end).</p></div>
<div class="indent1"><span class="nm">(c)</span><p>R. Chanina responded that the Shechinah is with us even so.</p></div>
<div class="subject"><span class="nm">2)</span><p>VECHEN YA'ASEH</p></div>
<div class="indent1"><span class="nm">(a)</span><p>The Beraisa uses this Pasuk as a Hekesh (to connect Par-Sa'ir and Heichal-Kodesh ha'Kodoshim).</p></div>
<div class="indent1"><span class="nm">(b)</span><p><span class="cl">Question:</span> Can something which is, itself, derived from a Hekesh (Par from Sa'ir) in turn teach a Hekesh (Heichal from Lifnim)?!</p></div>
<div class="indent1"><span class="nm">(c)</span><p><span class="cl">Answer:</span> This is not called a Hekesh (but rather Heimenu ve'Davar Acher).</p></div>
<div class="indent1"><span class="nm">(d)</span><p><span class="cl">Question:</span> But what according to the opinion that considers Heimenu as a Hekesh?</p></div>
<div class="indent1"><span class="nm">(e)</span><p><span class="cl">Answer:</span> The place is learned from one another (such that each Hekesh deals with its own issues and no Lamed is being Melamed).</p></div>
<div class="indent1"><span class="nm">(f)</span><p><span class="cl">Alternate Answer:</span> The Limudim can both be learned as one (Chutz from P'nim).</p></div>
<div class="subject"><span class="nm">3)</span><p>HAZA'AH IN THE HEICHAL</p></div>
<div class="indent1"><span class="nm">(a)</span><p>R. Elazar b. R. Yosi reported seeing drops of Dam (from the Sa'ir on Yom Kipur) on the Paroches in Rome, contrary to the Tana Kama who teaches that the Haza'ah is <i>not</i> on the Paroches itself.</p></div>
<div class="indent1"><span class="nm">(b)</span><p><span class="cl">Question:</span> Perhaps those drops were from other Korbanos (e.g. the Par He'elam Davar)?</p></div>
<div class="indent1"><span class="nm">(c)</span><p><span class="cl">Answer:</span> R. Elazar saw the (eight) drops in line.</p></div>
<div class="indent1"><span class="nm">(d)</span><p>The Beraisa teaches the same sequence regarding the other Korbanos:</p></div>
<div class="indent2"><span class="nm">1.</span><p>R. Elazar reported seeing <i>those</i> drops (and while those are not done on the Paroches, it is not Me'akev is some drops fall on it).</p></div>
<div class="indent2"><span class="nm">2.</span><p><span class="cl">Question:</span> Perhaps those were from Yom Kipur?</p></div>
<div class="indent2"><span class="nm">3.</span><p><span class="cl">Answer:</span> He saw they were not in line.</p></div>
<div class="subject"><span class="nm">4)</span><p>IF THE BLOOD OF THE PAR AND SA'IR BECAME MIXED</p></div>
<div class="indent1"><span class="nm">(a)</span><p>If they became mixed before the Haza'ah bi'Fenim:</p></div>
<div class="indent2"><span class="nm">1.</span><p><span class="cl">(Rava):</span> He does one set of Haza'os and it counts for both.</p></div>
<div class="indent2"><span class="nm">2.</span><p>R. Yirmiyah sharply put down Rava's suggestion.</p></div>
<div class="indent3"><span class="nm">i.</span><p>Rava ends up with the Sa'ir le'Ma'alah being sprinkled before the Par le'Matah, which is Pasul.</p></div>
<div class="indent3"><span class="nm">ii.</span><p>Rather, he must sprinkle one sent for Par and another set for Sa'ir.</p></div>
<div class="indent1"><span class="nm">(b)</span><p>If they became mixed after the Par le'Ma'alah:</p></div>
<div class="indent2"><span class="nm">1.</span><p>R. Papa suggested to do one Haza'ah le'Matah for both and then a Sa'ir le'Ma'alah.</p></div>
<div class="indent2"><span class="nm">2.</span><p>Rava told R. Papa that the insult leveled by R. Yirmiyah would apply doubly to this suggestion which repeated the earlier error.</p></div>
<div class="bbbline">57b----------------------------------------57b</p></div>
<div class="indent2"><span class="nm">3.</span><p>Rather, he must sprinkle for Par le'Matah and then offer a full set for Sa'ir.</p></div>
<div class="indent1"><span class="nm">(c)</span><p>If the cups of the Par and Sa'ir became confused:</p></div>
<div class="indent2"><span class="nm">1.</span><p>He sprinkles two sets from each cup.</p></div>
<div class="indent1"><span class="nm">(d)</span><p>If only some of each of the Damim became mixed:</p></div>
<div class="indent2"><span class="nm">1.</span><p>It seems obvious that he would use the non-mixed Dam!</p></div>
<div class="indent2"><span class="nm">2.</span><p>The question is whether the mixed Dam would be considered Shirayim (and placed on the Yesod) or it is Dechuyah (and spilt into the Amah).</p></div>
<div class="indent2"><span class="nm">3.</span><p><span class="cl">(R. Papa):</span> It is clearly Dechuyah.</p></div>
<div class="indent3"><span class="nm">i.</span><p>Even the opinion (R. Elazar b. R. Shimon, below) which maintains that one cup makes the others Shirayim would say so only if the contents of the cups could be, but were not, sprinkled.</p></div>
<div class="indent3"><span class="nm">ii.</span><p>Here, however, they <i>could not</i> be sprinkled and would be Dechuyah.</p></div>
<div class="indent2"><span class="nm">4.</span><p><span class="cl">(R. Huna b. R. Yehoshua):</span> It is clearly Shirayim.</p></div>
<div class="indent3"><span class="nm">i.</span><p>Even the opinion (Tana Kama, below) which maintains that one cup makes the other Dechuyah would say so only when nothing was offered from those cups.</p></div>
<div class="indent3"><span class="nm">ii.</span><p>In our case, parts of each cup <i>were</i> sprinkled.</p></div>
<div class="subject"><span class="nm">5)</span><p>SHIRAYIM OR DECHUYAH</p></div>
<div class="indent1"><span class="nm">(a)</span><p>The Machlokes (referred to above) is reported in the Beraisa which deals with a Chatas whose Dam was collected in four cups.</p></div>
<div class="indent1"><span class="nm">(b)</span><p>If the Matanos were offered partially from each cup:</p></div>
<div class="indent2"><span class="nm">1.</span><p><span class="cl">(Tana Kama):</span> The remaining Dam in each cup is Shirayim.</p></div>
<div class="indent2"><span class="nm">2.</span><p>If, however, the Matanos were offered from only one cup, then the Dam in the remaining cups is Dechuyah.</p></div>
<div class="indent2"><span class="nm">3.</span><p><span class="cl">(R. Elazar b. R. Shimon):</span> This second case would still make the rest Shirayim.</p></div>
<div class="indent2"><span class="nm">4.</span><p><span class="cl">Question:</span> How will R. Elazar learn the limitation of "ve'Es Damo (even partial Dam) Yishpoch"?</p></div>
<div class="indent2"><span class="nm">5.</span><p><span class="cl">Answer:</span> It will preclude the Shirayim remaining in the animal.</p></div>
