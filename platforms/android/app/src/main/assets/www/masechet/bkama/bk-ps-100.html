<p class="bas subject"><span class="nm">1)</span>ONE WHO ERRED ABOUT THE VALIDITY OF A COIN</p>
<p class="bas indent1"><span class="nm">(a)</span><span class="cl">Beraisa #1:</span> If Reuven asked a moneychanger (Levi) about a certain coin, and Levi said that it is good, and it turned out to be bad, if he is an expert moneychanger, he is exempt. If not, he is liable;</p>
<p class="bas indent1"><span class="nm">(b)</span><span class="cl">Contradiction (Beraisa #2):</span> In either case, he is liable.</p>
<p class="bas indent1"><span class="nm">(c)</span><span class="cl">Answer (Rav Papa):</span> Beraisa #1 exempts a very proficient moneychanger, who has learned everything he needs to know.</p>
<p class="bas indent1"><span class="nm">(d)</span><span class="cl">Question:</span> If so, how did he err?</p>
<p class="bas indent1"><span class="nm">(e)</span><span class="cl">Answer:</span> They had just changed the coinage, and he did not yet hear about this.</p>
<p class="bas indent1"><span class="nm">(f)</span>A woman showed a coin to R. Chiya. He told her that it is good. It turned out to be bad. He gave her a good coin in its place, and recorded his loss like a 'bad deal'.</p>
<p class="bas indent1"><span class="nm">(g)</span><span class="cl">Question:</span> R. Chiya had learned everything that he needed to know!</p>
<p class="bas indent1"><span class="nm">(h)</span><span class="cl">Answer:</span> He acted beyond the letter of the law.</p>
<p class="bas indent2"><span class="nm">1.</span><span class="cl">(Rav Yosef):</span> "You will make them know" refers to Talmud Torah. "The way" refers to bestowing Chesed. "They will go" refers to visiting the sick. "In it" refers to burial. "The deed" refers to the law. "That they will do" refers to going beyond the letter of the law.</p>
<p class="bas indent1"><span class="nm">(i)</span>Reish Lakish showed a coin to R. Elazar. He told him that it is good.</p>
<p class="bas indent2"><span class="nm">1.</span><span class="cl">Reish Lakish:</span> You should know that I rely on you.</p>
<p class="bas indent2"><span class="nm">2.</span><span class="cl">R. Elazar:</span> Do you expect me to pay if I am wrong? You yourself say that R. Meir is the Tana who obligates for Garmi!</p>
<p class="bas indent3"><span class="nm">i.</span><span class="cl">Suggestion:</span> This means that R. Meir obligates, but the Halachah does not follow him!</p>
<p class="bas indent2"><span class="nm">3.</span><span class="cl">Reish Lakish:</span> No, the Halachah follows R. Meir.</p>
<p class="bas subject"><span class="nm">2)</span>GARMI</p>
<p class="bas indent1"><span class="nm">(a)</span><span class="cl">Question:</span> Where do we find that R. Meir obligates for Garmi?</p>
<p class="bas indent1"><span class="nm">(b)</span><span class="cl">Answer #1 (Mishnah):</span> If a judge acquitted the guilty party, obligated the exempt party, declared Tamei what is really Tahor, or declared Tahor what is really Tamei, what he did is done, and the judge must pay (for any resulting loss. A Stam Mishnah is assumed to be R. Meir.)</p>
<p class="bas indent1"><span class="nm">(c)</span><span class="cl">Rejection:</span> R. Ila'a said that the Mishnah discusses a judge who acted on his ruling (e.g. he transferred the money himself, touched Tum'ah to the food (to 'prove' that it is Tamei), or mixed the 'Tahor' food with Taharos) which is standard damage, not Garmi).</p>
<p class="bas indent1"><span class="nm">(d)</span><span class="cl">Answer #2 (Mishnah - R. Meir):</span> If Reuven gave wool to Shimon to dye red, and he died it black, or vice-versa, Shimon pays him the value of the wool he received.</p>
<p class="bas indent1"><span class="nm">(e)</span><span class="cl">Rejection:</span> There, he damaged through his action (that is not Garmi).</p>
<p class="bas indent1"><span class="nm">(f)</span><span class="cl">Answer #3 (Mishnah):</span> If Reuven draped his vines over Shimon's grain, this forbids the grain, and Reuven is liable.</p>
<p class="bas indent1"><span class="nm">(g)</span><span class="cl">Rejection:</span> There also, he damaged through his action.</p>
<p class="bas indent1"><span class="nm">(h)</span><span class="cl">Answer #4 (Beraisa):</span> If the wall between Reuven's vineyard and Shimon's grain field was breached, and Shimon told him to fix it; it was breached, and he told him to fix it;</p>
<p class="bas bbbline">100b----------------------------------------100b</p>
<p class="bas indent2"><span class="nm">1.</span>If Reuven decided not to fix it, this forbids the grain, and Reuven is liable.</p>
<p class="bas subject"><span class="nm">3)</span>IMPROPER DYING</p>
<p class="bas indent1"><span class="nm">(a)</span><span class="cl">(Mishnah):</span> If Reuven gave wool to a dyer (Shimon), and the dye was ruined, Shimon pays the value of the wool.</p>
<p class="bas indent1"><span class="nm">(b)</span>If he dyed it poorly, Reuven pays the increased value of the wool or Shimon's expenses, whichever is smaller.</p>
<p class="bas indent1"><span class="nm">(c)</span>R. Meir says, if he was told to dye it red, and he died it black, or vice-versa, Shimon pays the value of the wool he received;</p>
<p class="bas indent1"><span class="nm">(d)</span>R. Yehudah says, Reuven pays the increased value or Shimon's expenses, whichever is smaller.</p>
<p class="bas indent1"><span class="nm">(e)</span><span class="cl">(Gemara) Question:</span> What does 'he dyed it poorly' mean?</p>
<p class="bas indent1"><span class="nm">(f)</span><span class="cl">Answer (Rav Nachman):</span> He dyed it with Kalbus.</p>
<p class="bas indent1"><span class="nm">(g)</span><span class="cl">Question:</span> What is this?</p>
<p class="bas indent1"><span class="nm">(h)</span><span class="cl">Answer (Rabah bar Shmuel):</span> It is the dregs of dye at the bottom of the cauldron.</p>
