<p class="bas indent1"><span class="nm">(a)</span><span class="cl">Question:</span> If the city was enticed by itself (people decided on their own to serve idolatry), what is the law?</p>
<p class="bas indent2"><span class="nm">1.</span>"Va'Yadichu" - not that it was enticed by itself;</p>
<p class="bas indent2"><span class="nm">2.</span>Or, even if it was enticed by itself?</p>
<p class="bas indent1"><span class="nm">(b)</span><span class="cl">Answer (Mishnah):</span> If the enticers were women or children (it is not an Ir ha'Nidachas).</p>
<p class="bas indent2"><span class="nm">1.</span>(They are not influential enticers), this is like being enticed by itself, and it does not become an Ir ha'Nidachas!</p>
<p class="bas indent1"><span class="nm">(c)</span><span class="cl">Rejection:</span> No, being drawn after women or children is not the same as being drawn after themselves.</p>
<p class="bas indent1"><span class="nm">(d)</span><span class="cl">(Mishnah):</span> Only if the majority of the city was enticed.</p>
<p class="bas indent1"><span class="nm">(e)</span><span class="cl">Question:</span> How do we determine whether or not the majority was enticed?</p>
<p class="bas indent1"><span class="nm">(f)</span><span class="cl">Answer #1 (Rav Yehudah):</span> We judge people, those found guilty are jailed; if the majority are convicted, the city is an Ir ha'Nidachas.</p>
<p class="bas indent1"><span class="nm">(g)</span><span class="cl">Rejection (Ula):</span> We do not delay execution!</p>
<p class="bas indent1"><span class="nm">(h)</span><span class="cl">Answer #2 (Ula (and R. Yochanan)):</span> Rather, we judge people, those found guilty are stoned; if the majority are convicted, the city is an Ir ha'Nidachas (and anyone found guilty from now on is beheaded).</p>
<p class="bas indent1"><span class="nm">(i)</span><span class="cl">Answer #3 (Reish Lakish):</span> We make many Batei Din, in order that we can judge all of them in one day (and give the proper Misah without delay).</p>
<p class="bas indent1"><span class="nm">(j)</span><span class="cl">Question (against Reish Lakish):</span> Rav Chama bar Yosi taught that "V'Hotzeisa Es ha'Ish...(El <i>She'arecha</i>)" - you judge individuals at the local Beis Din, but (most of) a city is only judged by the Great Sanhedrin!</p>
<p class="bas indent1"><span class="nm">(k)</span><span class="cl">Correction:</span> Rather, we make many Batei Din, in order to see how many transgressed; if we see that the majority sinned, the Great Sanhedrin will give the final verdict.</p>
<p class="bas subject"><span class="nm">2)</span>CRITERIA FOR MAKING AN <i>IR HA'NIDACHAS</i></p>
<p class="bas indent1"><span class="nm">(a)</span><span class="cl">(Mishnah):</span> "Hake Sakeh Es Yoshvei ha'Ir"...</p>
<p class="bas indent1"><span class="nm">(b)</span><span class="cl">(Beraisa):</span> If a caravan of donkey-drivers or camel- drivers stopped in a city that became an Ir ha'Nidachas (and they were enticed with it):</p>
<p class="bas indent2"><span class="nm">1.</span>If they were in the city for 30 days, they are killed by the sword and their property is destroyed (like residents of the city);</p>
<p class="bas indent2"><span class="nm">2.</span>If they were there less than 30 days, they are stoned, and their heirs inherit their money (like individuals who served idolatry).</p>
<p class="bas indent1"><span class="nm">(c)</span><span class="cl">Contradiction (Mishnah):</span> One who has lived in a city 12 months is considered a resident.</p>
<p class="bas indent1"><span class="nm">(d)</span><span class="cl">Answer (Rava):</span> One is not considered to be (a resident) of the city until 12 months;</p>
<p class="bas indent2"><span class="nm">1.</span>(Regarding Ir ha'Nidachas, it says "Yoshvei (those who dwell in) ha'Ir") - after 30 days, one is considered to be dwelling there.</p>
<p class="bas indent2"><span class="nm">2.</span><span class="cl">(Beraisa):</span> If one vows not to benefit from people of a city, this applies to people who have lived there for 12 months;</p>
<p class="bas indent3"><span class="nm">i.</span>If he vows from Yoshvei ha'Ir, this applies to people who have lived there for 30 days.</p>
<p class="bas subject"><span class="nm">3)</span>WHICH PROPERTY IS DESTROYED?</p>
<p class="bas indent1"><span class="nm">(a)</span><span class="cl">(Mishnah):</span> "Ha'Charem Osah..."</p>
<p class="bas indent1"><span class="nm">(b)</span><span class="cl">(Beraisa):</span> "Ha'Charem Osah" excludes property outside the city that belongs to Tzadikim of the city;</p>
<p class="bas indent2"><span class="nm">1.</span>"V'Es Kol Asher Bah" includes Tzadikim's property inside the city.</p>
<p class="bas indent2"><span class="nm">2.</span>"Shelalah (its spoils)", but not what pertains to Shamayim;</p>
<p class="bas indent2"><span class="nm">3.</span>"V'Es Kol Shelalah" includes property outside the city that belongs to Resha'im of the city.</p>
<p class="bas indent1"><span class="nm">(c)</span><span class="cl">R. Shimon:</span> The Torah says that Tzadikim's property inside the city is destroyed because it led them to live there.</p>
<p class="bas indent1"><span class="nm">(d)</span><span class="cl">(Beraisa):</span> "V'Es Kol Shelalah" includes Resha'im's property outside the city.</p>
<p class="bas indent1"><span class="nm">(e)</span><span class="cl">(Rav Chisda):</span> This is only if it is Nikbatzim b'Sochah (it was once in the city, and can be brought to the city within one day).</p>
<p class="bas indent1"><span class="nm">(f)</span><span class="cl">(Rav Chisda):</span> Deposits of people of an Ir ha'Nidachas are permitted.</p>
<p class="bas indent1"><span class="nm">(g)</span><span class="cl">Question:</span> What is the case?</p>
<p class="bas indent2"><span class="nm">1.</span><span class="cl">Suggestion:</span> Property of people of another city was deposited in the Ir ha'Nidachas.</p>
<p class="bas indent2"><span class="nm">2.</span><span class="cl">Rejection:</span> Obviously, we do not destroy it. It is not Shelalah!</p>
<p class="bas indent1"><span class="nm">(h)</span><span class="cl">Answer #1:</span> Property of Resha'im of the Ir ha'Nidachas was deposited in another city.</p>
<p class="bas indent1"><span class="nm">(i)</span><span class="cl">Rejection:</span> If it is Nikbatzim b'Sochah, it is forbidden. If it is not Nikbatzim b'Sochah, Rav Chisda already taught this!</p>
<p class="bas indent1"><span class="nm">(j)</span><span class="cl">Answer #2:</span> Really, property of people of another city was deposited (with Resha'im) in the Ir ha'Nidachas. The case is, the Shomrim accepted Acharayus;</p>
<p class="bas indent2"><span class="nm">1.</span>One might have thought that since they accepted Acharayus, it is considered like their property. Rav Chisda teaches that this is not so.</p>
<p class="bas indent1"><span class="nm">(k)</span><span class="cl">(Rav Chisda):</span> If half an animal belongs to an Ir ha'Nidachas and half to another city, it is forbidden;</p>
<p class="bas indent2"><span class="nm">1.</span>If half a dough belongs to an Ir ha'Nidachas and half to another city, it is permitted.</p>
<p class="bas indent1"><span class="nm">(l)</span><span class="cl">Question:</span> What is the reason?</p>
<p class="bas indent1"><span class="nm">(m)</span><span class="cl">Answer:</span> We do not consider an animal to be divided among the partners (rather, each owns half the entire animal), but we consider a dough to be divided. As if each partner owns (by himself) half the dough.</p>
<p class="bas indent1"><span class="nm">(n)</span><span class="cl">Question (Rav Chisda):</span> If an animal of an Ir ha'Nidachas was slaughtered, is this considered slaughter to inhibit Tum'as Neveilah?</p>
<p class="bas indent2"><span class="nm">1.</span>"L'Fi Charev" - there is no distinction how it was killed. It is like an animal killed without slaughter (a Neveilah);</p>
<p class="bas indent2"><span class="nm">2.</span>Or, the verse does not discuss if it was slaughtered, but if it was slaughtered, it is not Neveilah.</p>
<p class="bas indent1"><span class="nm">(o)</span>This question is not resolved.</p>
<p class="bas subject"><span class="nm">4)</span>WHICH PROPERTY IS DESTROYED? (cont.)</p>
<p class="bas indent1"><span class="nm">(a)</span><span class="cl">Question (Rav Yosef):</span> What is the law of hair of a Tzadekes of the city?</p>
<p class="bas indent1"><span class="nm">(b)</span><span class="cl">Objection (Rava):</span> You ask only about a Tzadekes. This implies that hair of a Resha'ah must surely be destroyed;</p>
<p class="bas indent2"><span class="nm">1.</span>"Tikbotz...  v'Sorafta" - we burn only what is ready to be gathered and burned, but not hair (or anything else) that must first be detached!</p>
<p class="bas indent1"><span class="nm">(c)</span><span class="cl">(Rava):</span> Rather, we may ask about a wig of a Tzadekes of the city.</p>
<p class="bas indent1"><span class="nm">(d)</span><span class="cl">Version #1 - Rashi - Question:</span> What is the case?</p>
<p class="bas indent2"><span class="nm">1.</span>If it attached to her, it is like herself (even the clothing she is wearing is spared)!</p>
<p class="bas indent1"><span class="nm">(e)</span><span class="cl">Answer:</span> The case is, it is hanging on a peg;</p>
<p class="bas indent2"><span class="nm">1.</span>Since she is not wearing it, it is like Tzadikim's property inside the city, and it is destroyed;</p>
<p class="bas indent2"><span class="nm">2.</span>Or, since she regularly puts it on, it is like clothing that she is wearing, and it is spared.</p>
<p class="bas indent1"><span class="nm">(f)</span><span class="cl">Version #2 - Ramah - Question:</span> What is the case?</p>
<p class="bas indent2"><span class="nm">1.</span>If it is attached to her (e.g. through wax), it is like herself!</p>
<p class="bas indent1"><span class="nm">(g)</span><span class="cl">Answer:</span> The case is, it is hanging on a peg in back of her ear;</p>
<p class="bas indent2"><span class="nm">1.</span>Is it destroyed with property of Tzadikim in the city?</p>
<p class="bas indent2"><span class="nm">2.</span>Or, since she is wearing it, is it like the clothing she wears, which is spared? (end of Version #2)</p>
<p class="bas indent1"><span class="nm">(h)</span>This question is not resolved.</p>
<p class="bas indent1"><span class="nm">(i)</span><span class="cl">(Mishnah):</span> "V'Es Kol Shelalah Tikbotz El Toch Rechovah..."</p>
<p class="bas indent1"><span class="nm">(j)</span><span class="cl">(Beraisa - R. Yishmael):</span> If it does not have a square, it cannot become an Ir ha'Nidachas;</p>
<p class="bas indent1"><span class="nm">(k)</span>R. Akiva says, if it does not have one, we build one.</p>
<p class="bas indent1"><span class="nm">(l)</span><span class="cl">Question:</span> What do they argue about?</p>
<p class="bas indent1"><span class="nm">(m)</span><span class="cl">Answer:</span> R. Yishmael holds that "Rechov<i>ah</i>" (<i>its</i> square) connotes that it was already there;</p>
<p class="bas indent2"><span class="nm">1.</span>R. Akiva holds that if now it has one, also this is called Rechovah.</p>

<p class="bas subject"><span class="nm">5)</span>KODSHIM IN AN <i>IR HA'NIDACHAS</i></p>
<p class="bas indent1"><span class="nm">(a)</span><span class="cl">(Mishnah):</span> Hekdesh is redeemed...</p>
<p class="bas indent1"><span class="nm">(b)</span><span class="cl">(Beraisa):</span> Kodshei Mizbe'ach (Korbanos) are left to die, Kodshei Bedek ha'Bayis (property of Hekdesh that is not used for the Avodah, but it is sold and the money is used for needs of Avodah) is redeemed, Terumah is left to rot, and Ma'aser Sheni and Kisvei ha'Kodesh are buried;</p>
<p class="bas indent1"><span class="nm">(c)</span>R. Shimon says, "Behemtah (<i>its</i> animals)" excludes Bechor (a firstborn Tahor Behemah, which is automatically a Korban) or Ma'aser Behemah (one tithes the animals born in his flock every year. Every 10th animal is a Korban), which are Kodesh;</p>
<p class="bas indent2"><span class="nm">1.</span>"Shelalah", but not money of Hekdesh or Ma'aser Sheni.</p>
<p class="bas indent1"><span class="nm">(d)</span><span class="cl">Question:</span> Why does the first Tana say that we leave Kodshei Mizbe'ach to die? We should graze them until they become blemished, redeem them, and use the money to bring another!</p>
<p class="bas indent1"><span class="nm">(e)</span><span class="cl">Answer #1 (R. Yochanan):</span> "Zevach Resha'im To'evah" (we should not bring a Korban from Resha'im).</p>
<p class="bas indent1"><span class="nm">(f)</span><span class="cl">Answer #2 (Reish Lakish):</span> The Mishnah discusses Kodshim with Acharayus (i.e. if the Korban becomes lost or blemished, the owner must bring another). The Tana is R. Shimon, who says that these are considered the property of the owner (therefore, it must be destroyed. We do not overtly kill them, for this would not be Kavod Shamayim.)</p>
<p class="bas indent1"><span class="nm">(g)</span><span class="cl">Objection:</span> R. Shimon argues. The first Tana cannot be R. Shimon!</p>
<p class="bas indent1"><span class="nm">(h)</span><span class="cl">Answer #3:</span> The Mishnah discusses Kodshim Kalim (they become permitted in all of Yerushalayim, even to Yisre'elim). The Tana is R. Yosi ha'Galili, who considers them like property of the owner.</p>
<p class="bas indent1"><span class="nm">(i)</span><span class="cl">Inference:</span> Kodshei Kodoshim (which become permitted only to Kohanim in the Mikdash) are not the property of the owner. We would redeem them.</p>
<p class="bas indent1"><span class="nm">(j)</span><span class="cl">Question:</span> Why does the Tana say that Kodshei Bedek ha'Bayis are redeemed? He should rather distinguish between Kodshim Kalim and Kodshei Kodoshim, and teach that Kodshei Kodoshim are redeemed!</p>
<p class="bas indent1"><span class="nm">(k)</span><span class="cl">Answer:</span> The Tana teaches that Kodshei Bedek ha'Bayis are redeemed, for this is always true;</p>
<p class="bas indent2"><span class="nm">1.</span>Not all Kodshei Kodoshim are redeemed. A Chatas is left to die (because its owner will die, and a Chatas whose owner died must die).</p>
<p class="bas indent1"><span class="nm">(l)</span>R. Yochanan did not answer like Reish Lakish, he learns from "Zevach Resha'im To'evah."</p>
<p class="bas indent1"><span class="nm">(m)</span><span class="cl">Question:</span> Why didn't Reish Lakish answer like R. Yochanan?</p>
<p class="bas indent1"><span class="nm">(n)</span><span class="cl">Answer:</span> He holds that "Zevach Resha'im To'evah" applies only to the actual Korban of the Rasha;</p>
<p class="bas indent2"><span class="nm">1.</span>Here, if we sell the Rasha's Korban and buy another, "Zevach Resha'im To'evah" does not apply.</p>
<p class="bas indent1"><span class="nm">(o)</span><span class="cl">(Beraisa - R. Shimon):</span> "Behemtah" excludes Bechor and Ma'aser.</p>
<p class="bas indent1"><span class="nm">(p)</span><span class="cl">Question:</span> What is the case?</p>
<p class="bas indent2"><span class="nm">1.</span>If they are Tamim (unblemished), these are spoils of Shamayim! (Shelalah excludes them.)</p>
<p class="bas indent2"><span class="nm">2.</span>If they are blemished, they are spoils of the city!</p>
<p class="bas indent1"><span class="nm">(q)</span><span class="cl">Answer (Ravina):</span> Really, they are blemished. They are not considered spoils of the city because one may not eat (and benefit from them) like his (Chulin) animals. A blemished Bechor or Ma'aser is like Shamayim's animal (it retains laws of Kedushah, e.g. one may not benefit from the milk or shearings or work with them).</p>
<p class="bas indent1"><span class="nm">(r)</span>Ravina argues with Shmuel.</p>
<p class="bas indent2"><span class="nm">1.</span><span class="cl">(Shmuel):</span> Everything is offered, and everything is redeemed.</p>
<p class="bas indent2"><span class="nm">2.</span><span class="cl">Question:</span> What does this mean?</p>
<p class="bas indent2"><span class="nm">3.</span><span class="cl">Answer:</span> Any Korban that is offered when it is Tam and redeemed if it is blemished (i.e. all Korbanos except for Bechor and Ma'aser), Shelalah excludes it (that it need not be destroyed);</p>
<p class="bas indent3"><span class="nm">i.</span>Any Korban that is offered when it is Tam and is not redeemed if it is blemished, i.e. Bechor and Ma'aser (they are eaten without redemption), Behemtah excludes it.</p>
<p class="bas subject"><span class="nm">6)</span>WHAT WE DO WITH TERUMAH AND MA'ASER</p>
<p class="bas indent1"><span class="nm">(a)</span><span class="cl">(Beraisa):</span> Terumah is left to rot.</p>
<p class="bas indent1"><span class="nm">(b)</span><span class="cl">(Rav Chisda):</span> This applies only to Terumah in a Yisrael's possession. Terumah that a Kohen received is his money, so it is burned.</p>
<p class="bas indent1"><span class="nm">(c)</span><span class="cl">Objection (Rav Yosef - Mishnah):</span> Ma'aser Sheni and Kisvei ha'Kodesh are buried.</p>
<p class="bas indent2"><span class="nm">1.</span>Ma'aser Sheni belongs to its owner just like Terumah belongs to a Kohen, and it must be buried!</p>
<p class="bas indent1"><span class="nm">(d)</span><span class="cl">Correction (Rav Chisda):</span> The Beraisa (which says that we leave Terumah to rot) discusses Terumah that a Kohen received. Terumah in a Yisrael's possession is given to a Kohen in another city.</p>
<p class="bas indent1"><span class="nm">(e)</span><span class="cl">(Mishnah - R. Meir):</span> A dough of Ma'aser Sheni is exempt from Chalah;</p>
<p class="bas indent1"><span class="nm">(f)</span>Chachamim say, Chalah must be taken.</p>
<p class="bas indent1"><span class="nm">(g)</span><span class="cl">(Rav Chisda):</span> They argue about Ma'aser Sheni in Yerushalayim. R. Meir says that it is Mamon Gavoha (i.e. like Hekdesh), and Chachamim say it is like Chulin;</p>
<p class="bas indent2"><span class="nm">1.</span>All agree that outside Yerushalayim, it is exempt (since it is forbidden there until it is redeemed, it is Mamon Gavoha. Alternatively, since it was forbidden like Mamon Gavoha at the time of kneading, it is always exempt, even after it is redeemed.)</p>
<p class="bas indent1"><span class="nm">(h)</span><span class="cl">Objection (Rav Yosef - Mishnah):</span> Ma'aser Sheni and Kisvei ha'Kodesh (of an Ir ha'Nidachas) are buried.</p>

<p class="bas indent2"><span class="nm">2.</span><span class="cl">Answer #1:</span> The city is Yerushalayim.</p>
<p class="bas indent2"><span class="nm">3.</span><span class="cl">Rejection (Beraisa):</span> Ten things are special about Yerushalayim... It cannot be condemned to be an Ir ha'Nidachas.</p>
<p class="bas indent2"><span class="nm">4.</span><span class="cl">Answer #2:</span> A different city became an Ir ha'Nidachas. One of the residents had brought Ma'aser Sheni to Yerushalayim.</p>
<p class="bas indent2"><span class="nm">5.</span><span class="cl">Rejection:</span> If so, once it entered the walls of Yerushalayim, it is Niklat (absorbed, and one may not take it out);</p>

<p class="bas indent2"><span class="nm">6.</span><span class="cl">Answer #3:</span> It was in another city, and it never entered Yerushalayim (and it must be buried. It is not considered Mamon Gavoha. According to Rav Chisda, this is not like either Tana!)</p>
<p class="bas indent1"><span class="nm">(i)</span><span class="cl">Answer #1 (and Answer #4 to Question (1)):</span> No, the case is, a different city became an Ir ha'Nidachas. A resident had brought Ma'aser Sheni to Yerushalayim, and it became Tamei (therefore, it may be taken out of Yerushalayim, so it is considered Nikbatzim b'Soch the Ir ha'Nidachas).</p>

<p class="bas indent2"><span class="nm">1.</span><span class="cl">(R. Elazar):</span> Tamei Ma'aser Sheni can be redeemed even in Yerushalayim (since it cannot be eaten) - "Ki Lo Suchal Se'eso";</p>

<p class="bas indent2"><span class="nm">1.</span>The case is, the walls of Yerushalayim fell (so it can no longer be eaten).</p>
<p class="bas indent2"><span class="nm">2.</span><span class="cl">(Rava):</span> Mid'Oraisa, Ma'aser can be eaten only within the walls. Mid'Rabanan, once Ma'aser enters the walls, it cannot be redeemed;</p>
