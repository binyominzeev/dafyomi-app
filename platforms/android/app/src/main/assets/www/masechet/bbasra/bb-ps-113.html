<p class="bas subject"><span class="nm">1)</span>TRANSFER OF INHERITANCE</p>
<p class="bas indent1"><span class="nm">(a)</span><span class="cl">(Beraisa):</span> "V'Lo Tisov Nachalah mi'Mateh l'Mateh Acher" refers to transfer through the husband;</p>
<p class="bas indent2"><span class="nm">1.</span><span class="cl">Suggestion:</span> Perhaps it discusses transfer through the son!</p>
<p class="bas indent2"><span class="nm">2.</span><span class="cl">Rejection:</span> "V'Lo Tisov Nachalah li'Vnei Yisrael mi'Mateh El Mateh" discusses transfer through the son!</p>
<p class="bas indent3"><span class="nm">i.</span>The other verse must discuss transfer through the husband.</p>
<p class="bas indent1"><span class="nm">(b)</span><span class="cl">Question:</span> Both Beraisos agree that "v'Lo Tisov Nachalah mi'Mateh l'Mateh Acher" refers to transfer through the husband. How did the Tana'im know this?</p>
<p class="bas indent1"><span class="nm">(c)</span><span class="cl">Answer #1 (Rabah bar Rav Shilo):</span> The verse says "Ish" (which can mean 'husband').</p>
<p class="bas indent1"><span class="nm">(d)</span><span class="cl">Objection:</span> Both verses say "Ish"!</p>
<p class="bas indent1"><span class="nm">(e)</span><span class="cl">Answer #2 (Rav Nachman bar Yitzchak):</span> It says "Yidbeku." (Elsewhere, the Torah discusses a husband clinging.)</p>
<p class="bas indent1"><span class="nm">(f)</span><span class="cl">Objection:</span> Both verses say "Yidbeku"!</p>
<p class="bas indent1"><span class="nm">(g)</span><span class="cl">Answer #3 (Rava):</span> It says "Yidbeku Matos" (marriage makes two tribes cling).</p>
<p class="bas indent1"><span class="nm">(h)</span><span class="cl">Answer #4 (Rav Ashi):</span> It says "l'Mateh Acher" - a son who inherits is not called 'Acher'.</p>
<p class="bas subject"><span class="nm">2)</span>A HUSBAND INHERITS ONLY WHAT HIS WIFE ALREADY OWNED</p>
<p class="bas indent1"><span class="nm">(a)</span><span class="cl">Question (R. Avahu):</span> What is the source that a husband does not inherit what was Ra'uy (destined to be his wife's), i.e. he inherits only what was Muchzak (she owned it when she died)?</p>
<p class="bas indent1"><span class="nm">(b)</span><span class="cl">Answer (R. Avahu):</span> "U'Sguv Holid Es Ya'ir va'Yhi Lo Esrim v'Shalosh Arim."</p>
<p class="bas indent2"><span class="nm">1.</span><span class="cl">Question:</span> How would Ya'ir have land that did not belong to his father?</p>
<p class="bas indent2"><span class="nm">2.</span><span class="cl">Answer:</span> We must say that Seguv married a woman, and she died before a relative who was destined to bequeath to her. When that relative died, (Seguv did not inherit;) Ya'ir inherited through his mother.</p>
<p class="bas indent1"><span class="nm">(c)</span>It also says "v'Elazar... va'Yikberu Oso b'Giv'as Pinchas Beno".</p>
<p class="bas indent2"><span class="nm">1.</span><span class="cl">Question:</span> How did Pinchas have land that did not belong to his father?</p>
<p class="bas indent2"><span class="nm">2.</span><span class="cl">Answer:</span> We must say that Elazar married a woman, and she died before a relative who was destined to bequeath to her. When that relative died, Pinchas inherited through his mother.</p>
<p class="bas indent1"><span class="nm">(d)</span><span class="cl">Question:</span> Why was it necessary to bring a proof also from Pinchas?</p>
<p class="bas indent1"><span class="nm">(e)</span><span class="cl">Answer:</span> One might have said that Ya'ir married a woman and inherited her. Therefore, he brought a proof from Pinchas.</p>
<p class="bas indent2"><span class="nm">1.</span><span class="cl">Suggestion:</span> Perhaps Pinchas (inherited his wife, or) received a Cherem field!</p>
<p class="bas indent2"><span class="nm">2.</span><span class="cl">Rejection:</span> "(B'Giv'as Pinchas) Beno" connotes that the inheritance was destined to fall to Elazar, but fell to his son.</p>
<p class="bas subject"><span class="nm">3)</span>INHERITANCE OF NEPHEWS</p>
<p class="bas indent1"><span class="nm">(a)</span><span class="cl">(Mishnah):</span> (Some inherit but do not bequeath:) sons of sisters (i.e. a man from his mother's sister).</p>
<p class="bas indent1"><span class="nm">(b)</span><span class="cl">(Beraisa):</span> Sons of sisters (inherit), but not daughters of sisters.</p>

<p class="bas indent1"><span class="nm">(c)</span><span class="cl">Question:</span> What does this teach?</p>
<p class="bas indent1"><span class="nm">(d)</span><span class="cl">Answer (Rav Sheshes):</span> It teaches that sons inherit before the daughters.</p>
<p class="bas indent1"><span class="nm">(e)</span><span class="cl">(Rav Shmuel bar Rav Yitzchak):</span> "V'Yorash" equates the second inheritance (Tosfos - grandchildren; Rashbam - siblings) to the first inheritance (children).</p>
<p class="bas indent2"><span class="nm">1.</span>Just like sons inherit before daughters, also in the second inheritance (Tosfos - if Yakov died after his son Reuven died, Reuven's sons inherit Yakov, and Reuven's daughters do not; Rashbam - brothers inherit before sisters).</p>
<p class="bas indent1"><span class="nm">(f)</span><span class="cl">(Rabah bar Chanina - Beraisa):</span> "B'Yom Hanchilu Es Banav" - inheritances fall during the day, but not at night.</p>
<p class="bas indent1"><span class="nm">(g)</span><span class="cl">Question (Abaye):</span> Will you say that if a man dies at night, his children don't inherit him?!</p>
<p class="bas indent2"><span class="nm">1.</span><span class="cl">Suggestion (Abaye):</span> Perhaps you referred to judging cases of inheritance.</p>
<p class="bas indent2"><span class="nm">2.</span><span class="cl">(Beraisa):</span> "V'Haysah li'Vnei Yisrael l'Chukas Mishpat" - the entire Parshah is considered judgment.</p>
<p class="bas indent2"><span class="nm">3.</span><span class="cl">(Rav Yehudah):</span> If three men came to visit a sick man (and he commanded who should inherit his property), they may write down his command, or execute it, whichever they want;</p>
<p class="bas indent3"><span class="nm">i.</span>If two came, they write down his command, but they may not execute it.</p>
<p class="bas indent2"><span class="nm">4.</span><span class="cl">(Rav Chisda):</span> This applies only during the day. At night, even three can only write, but they cannot execute (even the next day).</p>
<p class="bas indent2"><span class="nm">5.</span>This is because when they heard the command, they could be only witnesses, but not judges; and a witness cannot be a judge (about what he saw).</p>
<p class="bas indent1"><span class="nm">(h)</span><span class="cl">Answer (Rabah bar Chanina):</span> Indeed, my Beraisa teaches about judging inheritance.</p>
