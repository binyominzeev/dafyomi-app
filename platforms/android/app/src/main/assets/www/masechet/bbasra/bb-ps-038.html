<p class="bas subject"><span class="nm">1)</span>CHAZAKAH ON LAND UNDER A TREE</p>
<p class="bas indent1"><span class="nm">(a)</span><span class="cl">(Chachamim of Neharde'a):</span> If Reuven bought Shimon's date tree, he acquires with it the ground underneath, all the way down. (Rashbam - if the tree dies, Reuven can plant another; Tosfos - Shimon cannot dig there.)</p>
<p class="bas indent1"><span class="nm">(b)</span><span class="cl">Objection (Rava):</span> Shimon can say 'I sold to you (like people sell) Krug (saffron?) (i.e. until it dies)!</p>
<p class="bas indent1"><span class="nm">(c)</span><span class="cl">(Rava):</span> Rather, one who was Machazik three years in a tree is believed to say that he bought the ground underneath, all the way down.</p>
<p class="bas indent1"><span class="nm">(d)</span><span class="cl">Question (Mar Kashisha brei d'Rav Chisda):</span> If Shimon did not sell the ground underneath, all the way down, how can he stop Reuven from claiming this?</p>
<p class="bas indent1"><span class="nm">(e)</span><span class="cl">Answer (Rav Ashi):</span> He should have made a Macha'ah (told people that Reuven bought only the tree. If Reuven truly bought the ground underneath, he would know to continue to guard his document).</p>
<p class="bas indent1"><span class="nm">(f)</span><span class="cl">Support:</span> If we would not say so, why did Chachamim sanction Mashkanta of Sura?</p>
<p class="bas indent2"><span class="nm">1.</span>(The lender deducts a fixed amount from the loan for each year that he eats the Peros.) They write 'at the end of these (allotted) years, the land reverts to Ploni (the borrower) for free.'</p>
<p class="bas indent2"><span class="nm">2.</span>If the lender will hide the document after three years, he will be believed to say that he bought it. Chachamim would not sanction the Mashkanta if it can lead to theft!</p>
<p class="bas indent2"><span class="nm">3.</span>We must say that the borrower must make a Macha'ah. (If he does not, he caused his own loss.)</p>
<p class="bas indent2"><span class="nm">4.</span>Also here, Shimon should make a Macha'ah.</p>
<p class="bas subject"><span class="nm">2)</span>A CHAZAKAH NOT IN FRONT OF THE ORIGINAL OWNER</p>
<p class="bas indent1"><span class="nm">(a)</span><span class="cl">(Mishnah):</span> There are three regions regarding Chazakah: Yehudah, Ever ha'Yarden and Galil:</p>
<p class="bas indent2"><span class="nm">1.</span>If the original owner (Reuven) was in a different region than the Machazik (Shimon), the Chazakah is invalid. If they were in the same region, it is valid.</p>
<p class="bas indent1"><span class="nm">(b)</span>R. Yehudah says, it is valid. The reason we require three years for Chazakah is in order that Reuven will have time to protest, even if he is overseas!</p>
<p class="bas indent2"><span class="nm">1.</span>After Shimon uses the land for one year, people start talking about this. It takes one year for word to reach Reuven, and another year for Reuven to come and protest.</p>
<p class="bas indent1"><span class="nm">(c)</span><span class="cl">(Gemara) Question:</span> What is Chachamim's opinion about Macha'ah?</p>
<p class="bas indent2"><span class="nm">1.</span>If they hold that a Macha'ah not in front of the original owner is valid, Chazakah in a different region than the original owner should be valid!</p>
<p class="bas indent2"><span class="nm">2.</span>If they hold that a Macha'ah not in front of the original owner is invalid, Chazakah in the same region (if not in front of the original owner) should be invalid!</p>
<p class="bas indent1"><span class="nm">(d)</span><span class="cl">Answer (R. Aba bar Mamal):</span> Really, they hold that a Macha'ah not in front of the original owner is valid;</p>
<p class="bas indent2"><span class="nm">1.</span>Our Mishnah discusses a time when there is hostility between the regions (so caravans do not pass between them, and word does not spread from one region to another);</p>
<p class="bas indent2"><span class="nm">2.</span>The Tana illustrated this with Yehudah and Galil to teach that they are considered to have hostility with each other even in peacetime.</p>
<p class="bas bbbline">38b----------------------------------------38b</p>
<p class="bas indent1"><span class="nm">(e)</span><span class="cl">Version #1 (Rav Yehudah citing Rav):</span> One may not be Machazik in property of one who fled.</p>
<p class="bas indent1"><span class="nm">(f)</span><span class="cl">(Shmuel):</span> One may, for a Macha'ah not in front of the Machazik is valid! (The original owner can protest, just as if he were here.)</p>
<p class="bas indent1"><span class="nm">(g)</span><span class="cl">Question:</span> What did Rav come to teach?</p>
<p class="bas indent2"><span class="nm">1.</span><span class="cl">Suggestion:</span> He teaches that a Macha'ah not in front of the Machazik is invalid.</p>
<p class="bas indent2"><span class="nm">2.</span><span class="cl">Objection:</span> Rav holds that such a Macha'ah is valid!</p>
<p class="bas indent1"><span class="nm">(h)</span><span class="cl">Answer (to both questions):</span> Rav explains Chachamim of our Mishnah, but he rules unlike them.</p>
<p class="bas indent1"><span class="nm">(i)</span><span class="cl">Version #2 (Rav Yehudah citing Rav):</span> One can be Machazik in property of one who fled.</p>
<p class="bas indent1"><span class="nm">(j)</span><span class="cl">Objection (Shmuel):</span> This is obvious, for a Macha'ah not in front of the Machazik is valid!</p>
<p class="bas indent1"><span class="nm">(k)</span><span class="cl">Question:</span> Seemingly, Rav came to teach that a Macha'ah not in front of the Machazik is invalid. He already taught this. Why must he teach it again?!</p>
<p class="bas indent1"><span class="nm">(l)</span><span class="cl">Answer:</span> Rav teaches that a Macha'ah is valid even if the two who heard it cannot tell the Machazik.</p>
<p class="bas indent2"><span class="nm">1.</span><span class="cl">(Rav Anan citing Shmuel):</span> A Macha'ah is valid only if the two who heard it can tell the Machazik.</p>
<p class="bas indent2"><span class="nm">2.</span>Rav disagrees, for the two who heard it can tell their friends, those friends can tell their friends... (and the Machazik will hear). (end of Version #2)</p>
<p class="bas indent1"><span class="nm">(m)</span><span class="cl">(Rava):</span> One may not be Machazik in property of one who fled. A Macha'ah not in front of the Machazik is valid.</p>
<p class="bas indent1"><span class="nm">(n)</span><span class="cl">Objection:</span> These two laws contradict each other!</p>
<p class="bas indent1"><span class="nm">(o)</span><span class="cl">Answer:</span> Rava invalidates Chazakah in property of one who fled only if he fled for his life (for he cannot protest, lest the authorities hear where he is);</p>
<p class="bas indent2"><span class="nm">1.</span>If he fled for monetary reasons (e.g. from a creditor), he could protest (so one can be Machazik in his property).</p>
