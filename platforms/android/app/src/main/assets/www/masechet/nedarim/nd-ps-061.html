<p class="bas subject"><span class="nm">1)</span>WHEN DOES THE VOW END?</p>
<p class="bas indent1"><span class="nm">(a)</span><span class="cl">Answer #2 (Rav Ashi - Mishnah):</span> If one said 'wine is forbidden to me this year', and the year was made a leap year, he is forbidden also in the added month.</p>
<p class="bas indent2"><span class="nm">1.</span><span class="cl">Question:</span> What is the case?</p>
<p class="bas indent3"><span class="nm">i.</span>If it is like stated, this is obvious!</p>
<p class="bas indent2"><span class="nm">2.</span><span class="cl">Answer:</span> Rather, the case must be, he said 'a year'.</p>
<p class="bas indent2"><span class="nm">3.</span><span class="cl">Inference:</span> Saying 'a year' is like saying 'this year'. Likewise, saying 'a day' is like saying 'today'!</p>
<p class="bas indent1"><span class="nm">(b)</span><span class="cl">Rejection:</span> No. Really, he said 'this year';</p>
<p class="bas indent2"><span class="nm">1.</span>One might have thought that we follow most years, which are not leap years. The Mishnah teaches that this is not so.</p>
<p class="bas indent1"><span class="nm">(c)</span><span class="cl">Question:</span> If one said 'wine is forbidden to me for this Yovel (cycle of seven Shemitos)' what is the law?</p>
<p class="bas indent2"><span class="nm">1.</span>Does the 50th year count like part of this Yovel, or like part of the next?</p>
<p class="bas indent1"><span class="nm">(d)</span><span class="cl">Answer (Beraisa):</span> "You will sanctify the 50th year" - it is counted like the 50th year, but it does not count like the first year of the coming Shemitah cycle;</p>
<p class="bas indent2"><span class="nm">1.</span>R. Yehudah says, it also counts like the first year of the coming Shemitah.</p>
<p class="bas indent2"><span class="nm">2.</span><span class="cl">Objection (Chachamim):</span> It says "six years you will sow your field." According to you, there are only five years of planting between Yovel and the next Shemitah!</p>
<p class="bas indent3"><span class="nm">i.</span><span class="cl">Counter-objection (R. Yehudah):</span> It says, "The land will produce for three years." Also according to you, when Yovel follows Shemitah, the land must produce (in the year before Shemitah) for four years!</p>
<p class="bas indent3"><span class="nm">ii.</span><span class="cl">Answer:</span> You must say that the verse discusses Erev Shemitah when Shemitah is not followed by Yovel.</p>
<p class="bas indent2"><span class="nm">3.</span><span class="cl">Answer (R. Yehudah):</span> Also "six years..." discusses the years after a Shemitah not followed by Yovel.</p>
<p class="bas subject"><span class="nm">2)</span>DOES A PERSON ENTER A DOUBT?</p>
<p class="bas indent1"><span class="nm">(a)</span><span class="cl">(Mishnah):</span> If he said... (R. Meir says...'until Lifnei Pesach' forbids until it comes. R. Yosi forbids until the end of Pesach.)</p>
<p class="bas indent1"><span class="nm">(b)</span><span class="cl">Inference:</span> R. Meir holds that a person does not enter a doubt (i.e. he intends only for what his words surely connote), and R. Yosi holds that a person enters a doubt!</p>
<p class="bas bbbline">61b----------------------------------------61b</p>
<p class="bas indent1"><span class="nm">(c)</span><span class="cl">Contradiction (Mishnah - R. Meir):</span> Reuven has (at least two) daughters from each of two wives. He said 'I was Mekadesh my big daughter to a man. I don't remember if it was the oldest daughter from my first wife, or the oldest from my second wife, or the youngest from my first wife, who is older than all my daughters from my second wife.' Each of his daughters is Safek Mekudeshes, except for the youngest from the second wife;</p>
<p class="bas indent2"><span class="nm">1.</span>R. Yosi says, he surely was Mekadesh the oldest from the first wife.</p>
<p class="bas indent1"><span class="nm">(d)</span><span class="cl">Answer (R. Chanina ben Avdimi):</span> The opinions of R. Meir and R. Yosi in our Mishnah should be switched.</p>
<p class="bas indent1"><span class="nm">(e)</span><span class="cl">Support (Beraisa - R. Meir):</span> Regarding anything with a fixed time, if a person said 'Ad Lifnei (until before)', he is forbidden until the end;</p>
<p class="bas indent2"><span class="nm">1.</span>R. Yosi forbids until it starts.</p>
<p class="bas subject"><span class="nm">3)</span>UNTIL THE HARVEST</p>
<p class="bas indent1"><span class="nm">(a)</span><span class="cl">(Mishnah):</span> If one said 'until the harvest', 'until the grape harvest', or 'until the olive harvest', he is forbidden only until it begins;</p>
<p class="bas indent2"><span class="nm">1.</span>The rule is, regarding anything with a fixed time, if he said 'until it comes', he is forbidden until the start. If he said 'until it will be', he is forbidden until the end;</p>
<p class="bas indent2"><span class="nm">2.</span>Regarding anything without a fixed time, whether he said 'until it comes' or 'until it will be', he is forbidden only until the start.</p>
<p class="bas indent1"><span class="nm">(b)</span>If one said 'until the Kayitz (cutting, i.e. summer)' or 'until it will be Kayitz', he is forbidden until people start to gather in baskets;</p>
<p class="bas indent2"><span class="nm">1.</span>If he said 'until Kayitz passes', he is forbidden until people store away the knives used to cut figs.</p>
<p class="bas indent1"><span class="nm">(c)</span><span class="cl">(Gemara - Beraisa):</span> The Mishnah refers to a basket for figs, not for grapes.</p>
<p class="bas indent1"><span class="nm">(d)</span><span class="cl">(Beraisa):</span> If one vowed not to eat summer Peros, only figs are forbidden;</p>
<p class="bas indent1"><span class="nm">(e)</span>R. Shimon ben Gamliel says, this includes grapes.</p>
<p class="bas indent1"><span class="nm">(f)</span><span class="cl">Question:</span> Why does the first Tana only forbid figs?</p>
<p class="bas indent1"><span class="nm">(g)</span><span class="cl">Answer:</span> He holds that figs are plucked by hand, but grapes are not.</p>
<p class="bas indent2"><span class="nm">1.</span>R. Shimon ben Gamliel includes grapes, for these are also plucked by hand when the stems dry out.</p>
<p class="bas indent1"><span class="nm">(h)</span><span class="cl">(Mishnah):</span> If he said 'until Kayitz passes', he is forbidden until people store away the knives used to cut figs.</p>
<p class="bas indent1"><span class="nm">(i)</span><span class="cl">(Beraisa):</span> It is until most of these knives are stored away.</p>
