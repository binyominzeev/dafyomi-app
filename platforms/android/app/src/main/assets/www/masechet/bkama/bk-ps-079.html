<p class="bas subject"><span class="nm">1)</span>SLAUGHTER OR SALE THROUGH A <i>SHALI'ACH</i></p>
<p class="bas indent1"><span class="nm">(a)</span><span class="cl">(Beraisa):</span> One who stole an animal pays four or five for any of the following:</p>
<p class="bas indent2"><span class="nm">1.</span>He gave the animal to a Shali'ach, who slaughtered or sold it;</p>
<p class="bas indent2"><span class="nm">2.</span>He made it Hekdesh;</p>
<p class="bas indent2"><span class="nm">3.</span>He sold the animal on credit;</p>
<p class="bas indent2"><span class="nm">4.</span>He exchanged the animal for other goods, or gave the animal for a gift;</p>
<p class="bas indent2"><span class="nm">5.</span>He used it to pay for what he had bought on credit, or to pay a loan;</p>
<p class="bas indent2"><span class="nm">6.</span>He sent it for Savlonos (a gift to the house of the woman he was Mekadesh);</p>
<p class="bas indent1"><span class="nm">(b)</span><span class="cl">Question:</span> What Chidush do we learn?</p>
<p class="bas indent1"><span class="nm">(c)</span><span class="cl">Answer:</span> First, we learn that he is liable through a Shali'ach, i.e. if one makes a Shali'ach to slaughter or sell, it takes effect;</p>
<p class="bas indent2"><span class="nm">1.</span>Even though in (almost) all other cases, a Shali'ach to transgress is not a Shali'ach, here he is.</p>
<p class="bas indent2"><span class="nm">2.</span><span class="cl">Question:</span> What is the reason?</p>
<p class="bas indent2"><span class="nm">3.</span><span class="cl">Answer:</span> "And he slaughtered it or sold it" - just like he can sell it only through another (the buyer), he is liable also for slaughtering through another.</p>
<p class="bas indent1"><span class="nm">(d)</span>Then we learn that he is liable for making it Hekdesh. Giving to Hekdesh is like selling to a person.</p>
<p class="bas subject"><span class="nm">2)</span>WAS <i>MESHICHAH</i> ENACTED FOR SHOMRIM<i>?</i></p>
<p class="bas indent1"><span class="nm">(a)</span><span class="cl">(Mishnah):</span> If Reuven stole and slaughtered or sold an animal of Shimon, he pays four or five whether only the theft was from Shimon's premises (but not the slaughter or sale), or if only the slaughter or sale was in Shimon's premises, or if both were outside Shimon's premises;</p>
<p class="bas indent2"><span class="nm">1.</span>If both were in Shimon's premises, he does not pay four or five.</p>
<p class="bas indent1"><span class="nm">(b)</span>If Reuven was dragging the animal to take it out, and it died while still in Shimon's premises, he is exempt;</p>
<p class="bas indent2"><span class="nm">1.</span>If he lifted it, or took it outside and then it died, he is liable.</p>
<p class="bas indent1"><span class="nm">(c)</span>If he gave the animal to a Kohen to redeem his firstborn son, to his creditor, to a Shomer Chinam, borrower, Shomer Sachar or renter, and he was dragging it out, and it died in Shimon's premises, he is exempt;</p>
<p class="bas indent2"><span class="nm">1.</span>If he lifted it, or took it outside and then it died, he is liable.</p>
<p class="bas indent1"><span class="nm">(d)</span><span class="cl">(Gemara) Question (Ameimar):</span> Was there an enactment of Meshichah (taking the item to one's premises) regarding Shomrim? (Rashi - a Shomer is not liable until he does Meshichah; Tosfos - an owner can retract from his consent to lend or rent out his animal after Meshichah)?</p>
<p class="bas indent1"><span class="nm">(e)</span><span class="cl">Answer (Rav Yeimar - Mishnah):</span> If he gave the animal to a Kohen to redeem his son, to his creditor, or to a Shomer, and he was dragging it out, and it died in Shimon's premises, he is exempt.</p>
<p class="bas indent2"><span class="nm">1.</span><span class="cl">Suggestion:</span> Reuven's Shomer was dragging it. (Reuven is exempt because Meshichah is not complete until it leaves the owner's premises.) This teaches that they enacted Meshichah regarding Shomrim!</p>
<p class="bas indent1"><span class="nm">(f)</span><span class="cl">Rejection (Ameimar):</span> No, Reuven was dragging it from the premises of Shimon's Shomer.</p>
<p class="bas indent1"><span class="nm">(g)</span><span class="cl">Question:</span> We know this from the Reisha!</p>
<p class="bas indent1"><span class="nm">(h)</span><span class="cl">Answer:</span> The Mishnah teaches about one who steals from the owner's premises, and one who steals from a Shomer's house.</p>
<p class="bas indent1"><span class="nm">(i)</span><span class="cl">Objection (Rav Ashi):</span> There is no reason to differentiate between them! (The Mishnah need not teach both.)</p>
<p class="bas indent2"><span class="nm">1.</span>Rather, Reuven's Shomer was dragging it, like Rav Yeimar said. This teaches that they enacted Meshichah regarding Shomrim.</p>
<p class="bas indent1"><span class="nm">(j)</span>(R. Elazar) Just like they enacted Meshichah regarding buyers, also regarding Shomrim.</p>
<p class="bas indent1"><span class="nm">(k)</span>Support (Beraisa) Just like they enacted Meshichah regarding buyers, also regarding Shomrim;</p>
<p class="bas indent2"><span class="nm">1.</span>Just like land is acquired through money, a document or Chazakah, a rental agreement takes effect through money, a document or Chazakah.</p>
<p class="bas indent2"><span class="nm">2.</span><span class="cl">Question:</span> What rental does the Beraisa discuss?</p>
<p class="bas indent3"><span class="nm">i.</span><span class="cl">Suggestion:</span> It discusses rental of Metaltelim.</p>
<p class="bas bbbline">79b----------------------------------------79b</p>
<p class="bas indent3"><span class="nm">ii.</span><span class="cl">Rejection:</span> We do not write a document for Metaltelim.</p>
<p class="bas indent2"><span class="nm">3.</span><span class="cl">Answer (Rav Chisda):</span> It discusses rental of land.</p>
<p class="bas subject"><span class="nm">3)</span>THIEVES AND (OPEN) ROBBERS</p>
<p class="bas indent1"><span class="nm">(a)</span><span class="cl">(R. Elazar):</span> If witnesses saw Reuven hide in a forest (to steal animals that graze there) and slaughter or sell them, he pays four or five.</p>
<p class="bas indent1"><span class="nm">(b)</span><span class="cl">Question:</span> He did not do Meshichah!</p>
<p class="bas indent1"><span class="nm">(c)</span><span class="cl">Answer (Rav Chisda):</span> He hit the animals with a stick (so they would move. This is Meshichah.)</p>
<p class="bas indent1"><span class="nm">(d)</span><span class="cl">Question:</span> Since witnesses saw him, he is a Gazlan (open robber. Only a Ganav (covert thief) pays four or five)!</p>
<p class="bas indent1"><span class="nm">(e)</span><span class="cl">Answer:</span> Since he was trying to hide, he is a Ganav.</p>
<p class="bas indent1"><span class="nm">(f)</span><span class="cl">Question:</span> If so, what is the case of a Gazlan?</p>
<p class="bas indent1"><span class="nm">(g)</span><span class="cl">Answer #1 (R. Avahu):</span> It is like Benayahu ben Yehoyada - "he stole the spear from the hand of the Mitzri..."</p>
<p class="bas indent1"><span class="nm">(h)</span><span class="cl">Answer #2 (R. Yochanan):</span> It is like the people of Shechem - "they waited in ambush on the hilltops, and would rob anyone who passed."</p>
<p class="bas indent2"><span class="nm">1.</span><span class="cl">Question:</span> Why didn't R. Avahu learn from R. Yochanan's verse?</p>
<p class="bas indent2"><span class="nm">2.</span><span class="cl">Answer:</span> Since they hid (until people came), they are thieves.</p>
<p class="bas indent2"><span class="nm">3.</span>R. Yochanan holds that they hid only so people would not (see them and) flee.</p>
<p class="bas indent1"><span class="nm">(i)</span><span class="cl">Question:</span> Why does the Torah punish thieves more than (open) robbers?</p>
<p class="bas indent1"><span class="nm">(j)</span><span class="cl">Answer (R. Yochanan ben Zakai):</span> A robber does not disrespect Hash-m more than he disrespects people. He openly defies both;</p>
<p class="bas indent2"><span class="nm">1.</span>A thief defies Hash-m (without fear), but he fears people and hides from them;</p>
<p class="bas indent2"><span class="nm">2.</span>He acts as if Hash-m does not see or hear what he does - "woe to those who delve deeply to (try to) conceal their counsel from Hash-m; they act in darkness";</p>
<p class="bas indent3"><span class="nm">i.</span>Also, "they said 'Hashem does not see or understand.'"</p>
<p class="bas indent3"><span class="nm">ii.</span>Also, "they said 'Hashem abandoned the land, he does not see.'"</p>
<p class="bas indent1"><span class="nm">(k)</span><span class="cl">R. Meir:</span> R. Gamliel gave a parable. This is like two people in a city who made parties. One invited the people of the city, but not the king's children. The other invited neither. The punishment of the former is greater.</p>
<p class="bas indent1"><span class="nm">(l)</span><span class="cl">R. Meir:</span> How great is work! One who steals an ox deprives the owner of its labor. He pays five times the value;</p>
<p class="bas indent2"><span class="nm">1.</span>One who steals a Seh, which does not work, pays only four times.</p>
<p class="bas indent1"><span class="nm">(m)</span><span class="cl">R. Yochanan ben Zakai:</span> How great is the honor of people! When one steals an ox, the ox walks. The thief pays five times the value;</p>
<p class="bas indent2"><span class="nm">1.</span>One who steals a Seh must carry it on his shoulders (he is disgraced). He pays only four times.</p>
<p class="bas subject"><span class="nm">4)</span>RAISING ANIMALS IN <i>ERETZ</i> <i>YISRAEL</i></p>
<p class="bas indent1"><span class="nm">(a)</span><span class="cl">(Mishnah):</span> We may not raise small animals (i.e. that do not work) in (settled parts of) Eretz Yisrael, but we may raise them in Surya or wildernesses of Eretz Yisrael.</p>
<p class="bas indent1"><span class="nm">(b)</span>We may not raise chickens in Yerushalayim lest they cause Tum'ah to Kodshim. Kohanim (who eat Terumah) may not raise chickens anywhere in Eretz Yisrael;</p>
<p class="bas indent1"><span class="nm">(c)</span>One may not raise pigs anywhere. One may raise dogs only if they are tied on a leash.</p>
<p class="bas indent1"><span class="nm">(d)</span>We may not set traps for doves within four Mil of a settled area.</p>
<p class="bas indent1"><span class="nm">(e)</span><span class="cl">(Gemara - Beraisa #1):</span> We may not raise small animals in Eretz Yisrael, but we may raise them in forests of Eretz Yisrael;</p>
<p class="bas indent1"><span class="nm">(f)</span>In Surya, we may raise them even in settled areas, and all the more so in Chutz la'Aretz;</p>
<p class="bas indent1"><span class="nm">(g)</span><span class="cl">(Beraisa #2):</span> We may not raise small animals in Eretz Yisrael, but we may raise them in wildernesses of Yehudah, or near Ako;</p>
<p class="bas indent1"><span class="nm">(h)</span>One may raise large animals, because we do not impose a decree that the majority of the Tzibur cannot fulfill;</p>
<p class="bas indent2"><span class="nm">1.</span>It is not necessary to raise small animals. People can get them (for Korbanos or to eat) from Chutz la'Aretz;</p>
<p class="bas indent2"><span class="nm">2.</span>Large animals are constantly needed for labor. It is not feasible to get them from Chutz la'Aretz.</p>
<p class="bas indent1"><span class="nm">(i)</span>Even though one may not raise small animals in Eretz Yisrael, one may get one within 30 days of when he needs it for a festival or for his son's wedding feast;</p>
<p class="bas indent1"><span class="nm">(j)</span>He may not keep the last animal 30 days.</p>
<p class="bas indent2"><span class="nm">1.</span>One might have thought that if one bought some animals 30 days before the Regel and some just before it, he may first slaughter the former and keep the latter until 30 days from their purchase. The Beraisa teaches that this is not so. He may not leave them after the Regel at all.</p>
<p class="bas indent1"><span class="nm">(k)</span>A butcher may buy what he will need to slaughter for the market day. He may not leave the last animal bought after the market day until 30 days (from its purchase).</p>
