<div class="indent1"><span class="nm">(a)</span><p><span class="cl">Question:</span> We need this verse for the following teaching!</p></div>
<div class="indent2"><span class="nm">1.</span><p><span class="cl">(Beraisa) Question:</span> From where do we know that Menachos may not be traded for Zevachim?</p></div>
<div class="indent2"><span class="nm">2.</span><p><span class="cl">Answer:</span> "V'Chol Minchah...l'Chol Bnei Aharon Tihyeh".</p></div>
<div class="indent2"><span class="nm">3.</span><p><span class="cl">Suggestion:</span> Perhaps Menachos may not be traded for Zevachim, because a (moderately) poor person never brings a Minchah in place of an animal, but Menachos may be traded for birds, because a very poor person brings a Minchah in place of birds!</p></div>
<div class="indent2"><span class="nm">4.</span><p><span class="cl">Rejection:</span> "V'Chol Na'aseh b'Marcheshes l'Chol Bnei Aharon Tihyeh".</p></div>
<div class="indent2"><span class="nm">5.</span><p><span class="cl">Suggestion:</span> Perhaps Menachos may not be traded for birds, because birds have blood and Menachos are made of flour, but birds may be traded for animals, because both have blood!</p></div>
<div class="indent2"><span class="nm">6.</span><p><span class="cl">Rejection:</span> "V'Al Machavas l'Chol Bnei Aharon Tihyeh" (the verse is not needed to teach about Menachos, it is expounded to teach about other offerings).</p></div>
<div class="indent2"><span class="nm">7.</span><p><span class="cl">Suggestion:</span> Perhaps birds may not be traded for animals, because animals require a Kli (for Shechitah; alternatively, for Kabalah), birds do not (the Kohen does Melikah (and Haza'ah and Mitzuy) with his bare hand), but Menachos may be traded for other Menachos, since the hand is used for (Kemitzah of) both of them!</p></div>
<div class="indent2"><span class="nm">8.</span><p><span class="cl">Rejection:</span> "V'Chol Minchah Velulah va'Shemen...l'Chol Bnei Aharon Tihyeh".</p></div>
<div class="indent2"><span class="nm">9.</span><p><span class="cl">Suggestion:</span> Perhaps (Menachos cooked in) Marcheshes and Machavas may not be traded for each other, for the former are soft and the latter are hard, but Menachos of the same consistency may be traded for each other!</p></div>
<div class="indent2"><span class="nm">10.</span><p><span class="cl">Rejection:</span> "...Va'Charevah l'Chol Bnei Aharon Tihyeh".</p></div>
<div class="indent2"><span class="nm">11.</span><p><span class="cl">Suggestion:</span> Perhaps Kohanim may not trade Kodshei Kodashim, but they may trade Kodshim Kalim.</p></div>
<div class="indent2"><span class="nm">12.</span><p><span class="cl">Rejection:</span> "Ish k'Achiv...V'Im Al Todah" - just like they may not trade (Menachos which are) Kodshei Kodashim, they may not trade Kodshim Kalim.</p></div>
<div class="indent2"><span class="nm">13.</span><p>"Ish" - a man receives a share, even a Ba'al Mum, a minor does not receive, even if he is Tam.</p></div>
<div class="indent1"><span class="nm">(b)</span><p><span class="cl">Answer:</span> The Beraisa learns from 'Kol', Chizkiyah learns from 'Minchah'.</p></div>
<div class="indent1"><span class="nm">(c)</span><p><span class="cl">Question:</span> We need this verse for R. Yosi b'Rebbi Yehudah's teaching (that a Minchah may not be half Chalos and half Rekikim! Tosfos - even though we explain R. Shimon's opinion, and the Gemara in Kidushin says that R. Yehudah taught this Beraisa, and both of them argue with R. Yosi b'Rebbi Yehudah, we ask whether R. Yosi can agree with the Beraisa.)</p></div>
<div class="indent1"><span class="nm">(d)</span><p><span class="cl">Answer:</span> R. Yosi b'Rebbi Yehudah learns from the extra 'Vov' in "v'Chol".</p></div>
<div class="indent1"><span class="nm">(e)</span><p><span class="cl">Answer #2 (to Question 4:k, 72B - Ravina):</span> He learns like Levi:</p></div>
<div class="indent2"><span class="nm">1.</span><p><span class="cl">(Beraisa - Levi):</span> "Kol Korbanam (...Lecha Hu ul'Vanecha)" includes the Log of oil of a Metzora (that Kohanim eat the remainder after Matanos Behonos);</p></div>
<div class="indent3"><span class="nm">i.</span><p>One might have thought that Kohanim only get "Min ha'Esh" (none of the oil is offered on the Mizbe'ach.)</p></div>
<div class="indent2"><span class="nm">2.</span><p>"L'Chol Minchasam" includes the Omer and Kena'os;</p></div>
<div class="indent3"><span class="nm">i.</span><p>One might have thought that "V'Achlu Osam Asher Kupar Bahem" only teaches that Kohanim eat Korbanos brought for atonement, but the Omer permits and Minchas Sotah clarifies (whether or not she is guilty.)</p></div>
<div class="indent2"><span class="nm">3.</span><p>"Ul'Chol Chatasam" includes Chatas ha'Of;</p></div>
<div class="indent3"><span class="nm">i.</span><p>One might have thought that it may not be eaten, for it is Neveilah (Melikah is not slaughter.)</p></div>
<div class="indent2"><span class="nm">4.</span><p>"Ul'Chol Ashamam" includes Asham Nazir and Asham Metzora;</p></div>
<div class="indent2"><span class="nm">5.</span><p><span class="cl">Objection:</span> Regarding Asham Metzora it says "Ka'Chatas ha'Asham"!</p></div>
<div class="indent2"><span class="nm">6.</span><p><span class="cl">Correction:</span> It means, we include Asham Nazir like Asham Metzora;</p></div>
<div class="indent3"><span class="nm">i.</span><p>One might have thought that Asham Nazir is not eaten, for it is not brought for atonement, only to permit (a Nazir (who became Tamei Mes, then became Tahor) to begin Nezirus Taharah. Rashi Kesav Yad, R. Gershom, Shitah Mekubetzes and Rashba all say that it also permits him to wine and/or Tum'ah - perhaps they mean, it will enable him to finish Nezirus Taharah sooner and drink wine/become Tamei.)</p></div>
<div class="indent2"><span class="nm">7.</span><p>"Asher Yashivu" refers to Gezel ha'Ger (one who stole from a convert and swore to deny it, and wants to do Teshuvah after the convert died without heirs, he brings an Asham and gives the money and an added fifth to the Kohen);</p></div>
<div class="indent3"><span class="nm">i.</span><p>"Lecha Hu ul'Vanecha" - Kohanim totally own the money, they may Mekadesh a woman with it (unlike Kodshim, which are Hash-m's, Kohanim merely have the right to eat them.)</p></div>

<div class="subject"><span class="nm">2)</span><p>KODSHIM OF NOCHRIM</p></div>
<div class="indent1"><span class="nm">(a)</span><p><span class="cl">(Rav Huna):</span> The Shelamim of a Nochri is an Olah - we learn from reasoning or a verse:</p></div>
<div class="indent2"><span class="nm">1.</span><p>It is reasonable that it is an Olah, for a Nochri intends that his Korban go entirely to Hash-m;</p></div>
<div class="indent2"><span class="nm">2.</span><p>We can also learn from "Asher Yakrivu la'Shem l'Olah" - whatever he offers is an Olah.</p></div>
<div class="indent1"><span class="nm">(b)</span><p><span class="cl">Question (R. Chama bar Gurya - Beraisa):</span> If a Nochri volunteered to bring a Shelamim:</p></div>
<div class="indent2"><span class="nm">1.</span><p>If he gave it to a Yisrael, the Yisrael eats it;</p></div>
<div class="indent2"><span class="nm">2.</span><p>If he gave it to a Kohen, the Kohen eats it.</p></div>
<div class="indent1"><span class="nm">(c)</span><p><span class="cl">Answer (Rava):</span> It means, if he gave it to a Yisrael (Rashi - who was obligated to bring a Shelamim) to be offered on behalf of the Yisrael, the Yisrael eats it; if he gave it to be offered on behalf of a Kohen, the Kohen eats it. (Rav Huna discusses a Nochri who brings a Shelamim without specifying, i.e. on behalf of himself.)</p></div>
<div class="indent1"><span class="nm">(d)</span><p><span class="cl">Question (Rav Shizbi - Mishnah):</span> Kemitzah is taken from the following Menachos and the Shirayim are eaten by Kohanim -...Minchas Nochrim...(likewise, Shelamim of a Nochri should be eaten!)</p></div>
<div class="indent1"><span class="nm">(e)</span><p><span class="cl">Answer (R. Yochanan):</span> Our Mishnah is like R. Yosi ha'Galili, Rav Huna's law is like R. Akiva. (Apparently, this is also a second answer to Question (b).)</p></div>
<div class="indent2"><span class="nm">1.</span><p><span class="cl">(Beraisa - R. Yosi ha'Galili) Question:</span> What do we learn from "Ish Ish (...Asher Yakriv)"?</p></div>
<div class="indent2"><span class="nm">2.</span><p><span class="cl">Answer:</span> This teaches that Nochrim may offer Korbanos, like Yisrael.</p></div>
<div class="indent2"><span class="nm">3.</span><p><span class="cl">Question:</span> The verse continues "...Asher Yakrivu la'Shem l'Olah" - what is the source that Nochrim may offer Shelamim?</p></div>

<div class="indent2"><span class="nm">9.</span><p><span class="cl">Question:</span> Since they may offer all of these, why does it specify "l'Olah"?</p></div>
<div class="indent2"><span class="nm">10.</span><p><span class="cl">Answer:</span> This excludes (Korbanos of) Nezirus</p></div>
<div class="indent2"><span class="nm">11.</span><p>R. Akiva says, "Asher Yakrivu la'Shem l'Olah" teaches that that may offer only Olos.</p></div>
<div class="indent1"><span class="nm">(f)</span><p><span class="cl">Question:</span> A different verse excludes Nochrim from Nezirus - "Daber El Bnei Yisrael...Ish...Ki Yafli Lindor Neder Nazir", only a Yisrael may become a Nazir!</p></div>
<div class="indent1"><span class="nm">(g)</span><p><span class="cl">Answer:</span> If we only had the verse "Asher Yakrivu la'Shem l'Olah", one might have thought that Nochrim can be Nezirim, just they are exempt from Korbanos Nazir;</p></div>

<div class="indent2"><span class="nm">1.</span><p><span class="cl">(Mishnah - R. Shimon):</span> (If someone found an animal near Yerushalayim and wants to offer it on behalf of the loser (perhaps it is a Korban), the Tzibur brings the Nesachim;) this is one of seven enactments of Beis Din;</p></div>
<div class="indent2"><span class="nm">2.</span><p>Another enactment - if a Nochri sent an Olah to be offered in the Mikdash and (money for) its Nesachim, we offer the Nesachim from his money;</p></div>
