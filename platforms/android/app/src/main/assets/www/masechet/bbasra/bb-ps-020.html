<p class="bas indent1"><span class="nm">(a)</span><span class="cl">Question:</span> How is the barrel positioned?</p>
<p class="bas indent2"><span class="nm">1.</span>If the opening faces out (away from the Tum'ah), the barrel itself blocks Tum'ah!</p>
<p class="bas indent3"><span class="nm">i.</span>Earthenware Kelim receive Tum'ah only from their interiors!</p>
<p class="bas indent1"><span class="nm">(b)</span><span class="cl">Answer #1:</span> Rather, the opening faces the Tum'ah.</p>
<p class="bas indent1"><span class="nm">(c)</span><span class="cl">Answer #2:</span> We can even say that it faces out. The case is, the barrel is made of metal.</p>
<p class="bas indent1"><span class="nm">(d)</span><span class="cl">Question (Beraisa):</span> The following block Tum'ah: grass that was detached and placed in a window, or grew there by itself; rags smaller than three fingers by three fingers; a dangling limb or flesh of an animal; a bird that rested there; a Nochri who sat there, a (i.e. stillborn) baby born in the eighth month; salt; earthenware Kelim; and a Sefer Torah;</p>
<p class="bas indent2"><span class="nm">1.</span><span class="cl">The following do not block Tum'ah:</span> snow, hail, ice, frost, and water.</p>
<p class="bas indent2"><span class="nm">2.</span><span class="cl">Summation of question:</span> Grass is fit for an animal, and it blocks Tum'ah!</p>
<p class="bas indent1"><span class="nm">(e)</span><span class="cl">Answer:</span> It discusses poisonous grass.</p>
<p class="bas indent1"><span class="nm">(f)</span><span class="cl">Question:</span> The grass blocks, even if it grew by itself. It is destined to be cut, since it damages the wall!</p>
<p class="bas indent1"><span class="nm">(g)</span><span class="cl">Answer #1 (Rabah):</span> The Beraisa discusses the wall of a ruin (the grass is not destined to be cut).</p>
<p class="bas indent1"><span class="nm">(h)</span><span class="cl">Answer #2 (Rav Papa):</span> It can even be a wall of an inhabited building. The grass is three Tefachim away (and does not harm the wall), but the top bends into the window.</p>
<p class="bas indent1"><span class="nm">(i)</span><span class="cl">Question:</span> Why do rags block? They are fitting to patch torn clothing!</p>
<p class="bas indent1"><span class="nm">(j)</span><span class="cl">Answer:</span> The material is too thick to be used for a patch.</p>
<p class="bas indent2"><span class="nm">1.</span><span class="cl">Question:</span> They are fitting for a bloodletter (to clean the wound)!</p>
<p class="bas indent2"><span class="nm">2.</span><span class="cl">Answer:</span> They are of sackcloth, which would scratch the skin.</p>
<p class="bas indent2"><span class="nm">3.</span><span class="cl">Objection:</span> If so, why did the Beraisa say 'they are not three fingers by three fingers'? Sackcloth is not Tamei unless it is four Tefachim by four Tefachim!</p>
<p class="bas indent2"><span class="nm">4.</span><span class="cl">Answer:</span> It is not really sackcloth, just it is scratchy like sackcloth.</p>
<p class="bas indent1"><span class="nm">(k)</span><span class="cl">Question:</span> Why does a dangling limb or flesh of an animal block Tum'ah? The animal may go away!</p>
<p class="bas indent1"><span class="nm">(l)</span><span class="cl">Answer:</span> The case is, it is tied down.</p>
<p class="bas indent2"><span class="nm">1.</span><span class="cl">Question:</span> Someone may come and slaughter it!</p>
<p class="bas indent2"><span class="nm">2.</span><span class="cl">Answer:</span> It is a non-Kosher animal.</p>
<p class="bas indent2"><span class="nm">3.</span><span class="cl">Question:</span> The owner might sell it to a Nochri!</p>
<p class="bas indent2"><span class="nm">4.</span><span class="cl">Answer:</span> It is a weak animal.</p>
<p class="bas indent2"><span class="nm">5.</span><span class="cl">Question:</span> He may cut it up to feed it to dogs!</p>
<p class="bas indent2"><span class="nm">6.</span><span class="cl">Answer:</span> That would cause needless pain to a living animal. He would not do this.</p>
<p class="bas indent1"><span class="nm">(m)</span><span class="cl">Question:</span> Why does a bird that rested there block Tum'ah? It may fly away!</p>
<p class="bas indent1"><span class="nm">(n)</span><span class="cl">Answer:</span> The case is, it is tied down.</p>
<p class="bas indent2"><span class="nm">1.</span><span class="cl">Question:</span> Someone may come and slaughter it!</p>
<p class="bas indent2"><span class="nm">2.</span><span class="cl">Answer:</span> It is a non-Kosher bird.</p>
<p class="bas indent2"><span class="nm">3.</span><span class="cl">Question:</span> The owner might sell it to a Nochri!</p>
<p class="bas indent2"><span class="nm">4.</span><span class="cl">Answer:</span> It is a Kalanisa (a very lean bird).</p>
<p class="bas indent2"><span class="nm">5.</span><span class="cl">Question:</span> He may give it to a child to play with!</p>
<p class="bas indent2"><span class="nm">6.</span><span class="cl">Answer:</span> He would not, for it scratches.</p>
<p class="bas indent2"><span class="nm">7.</span>Objection A Kalanisa does not scratch!</p>
<p class="bas indent2"><span class="nm">8.</span><span class="cl">Answer:</span> It is a different species, but it is as lean as a Kalanisa.</p>
<p class="bas indent1"><span class="nm">(o)</span><span class="cl">Question:</span> Why does a Nochri who rested there block Tum'ah? He will walk away!</p>
<p class="bas indent1"><span class="nm">(p)</span><span class="cl">Answer:</span> He is tied down.</p>
<p class="bas indent2"><span class="nm">1.</span><span class="cl">Question:</span> A friend will untie him!</p>
<p class="bas indent2"><span class="nm">2.</span><span class="cl">Answer #1:</span> He is a leper.</p>
<p class="bas indent2"><span class="nm">3.</span><span class="cl">Objection:</span> Another leper will untie him!</p>
<p class="bas indent2"><span class="nm">4.</span><span class="cl">Answer #2:</span> Rather, he is a prisoner of the king.</p>
<p class="bas subject"><span class="nm">2)</span>OTHER SHIELDS FROM TUM'AH</p>
<p class="bas indent1"><span class="nm">(a)</span><span class="cl">Question:</span> Why does a baby born in the eighth month block Tum'ah? His mother will take him!</p>
<p class="bas indent1"><span class="nm">(b)</span><span class="cl">Answer:</span> The baby blocks Tum'ah on Shabbos;</p>
<p class="bas indent2"><span class="nm">1.</span><span class="cl">(Beraisa):</span> An eighth-month baby is (Muktzeh) like a stone. One may not move him on Shabbos. However, his mother may bend over to let him nurse (without moving him), due to the danger (to him, and to her if she is too full of milk).</p>
<p class="bas indent1"><span class="nm">(c)</span><span class="cl">Question:</span> Why does salt block Tum'ah? It is fitting to use!</p>
<p class="bas indent1"><span class="nm">(d)</span><span class="cl">Answer:</span> It is bitter salt.</p>
<p class="bas indent2"><span class="nm">1.</span><span class="cl">Question:</span> It is fitting for tanning!</p>
<p class="bas indent2"><span class="nm">2.</span><span class="cl">Answer:</span> There are thorns in it.</p>
<p class="bas indent2"><span class="nm">3.</span><span class="cl">Question:</span> If so, it harms the wall. He will remove it!</p>
<p class="bas indent2"><span class="nm">4.</span><span class="cl">Answer:</span> It is resting on earthenware (and does not harm the wall).</p>
<p class="bas indent2"><span class="nm">5.</span><span class="cl">Question:</span> The earthenware itself should block Tum'ah!</p>
<p class="bas bbbline">20b----------------------------------------20b</p>
<p class="bas indent2"><span class="nm">6.</span><span class="cl">Answer:</span> It is too small to block the Tum'ah.</p>
<p class="bas indent3"><span class="nm">i.</span><span class="cl">(Mishnah):</span> One is liable for carrying earthenware in a Reshus ha'Rabim on Shabbos if it is big enough to put between bars in a window. (Rashi - anything smaller than this has no importance, it does not block Tum'ah; Tosfos - since it has no use, he will not take it, so the salt blocks the Tum'ah).</p>
<p class="bas indent1"><span class="nm">(e)</span><span class="cl">Question:</span> Why does an earthenware Keli block Tum'ah? One can use it</p>
<p class="bas indent1"><span class="nm">(f)</span><span class="cl">Answer:</span> It is dirty.</p>
<p class="bas indent2"><span class="nm">1.</span><span class="cl">Question:</span> It is fitting for a bloodletter!</p>
<p class="bas indent2"><span class="nm">2.</span><span class="cl">Answer:</span> It has a hole in it.</p>
<p class="bas indent1"><span class="nm">(g)</span><span class="cl">Question:</span> Why does a Sefer Torah block Tum'ah? One can read from it!</p>
<p class="bas indent1"><span class="nm">(h)</span><span class="cl">Answer:</span> The case is, it is worn out.</p>
<p class="bas indent2"><span class="nm">1.</span><span class="cl">Question:</span> It must be buried!</p>
<p class="bas indent2"><span class="nm">2.</span><span class="cl">Answer:</span> Its 'burial' will be leaving in the window permanently.</p>
<p class="bas indent1"><span class="nm">(i)</span><span class="cl">(Rav):</span> We may make a divider from anything except salt (lest it scatter) and fat (lest it melt).</p>
<p class="bas indent1"><span class="nm">(j)</span><span class="cl">(Shmuel):</span> Even salt may be used.</p>
<p class="bas indent1"><span class="nm">(k)</span><span class="cl">Resolution #1 (Rav Papa):</span> They don't argue. Sedom salt may be used, for it is hard and does not scatter. (Regular) salt may not be used.</p>
<p class="bas indent1"><span class="nm">(l)</span><span class="cl">Resolution #2:</span> Both can discuss (regular) salt, according to Rabah;</p>
<p class="bas indent2"><span class="nm">1.</span><span class="cl">(Rabah):</span> One may place the Korah (a beam to permit carrying in an alleyway) on two piles of salt (the weight stops the salt from scattering).</p>
<p class="bas indent2"><span class="nm">2.</span>Rav discusses when there is no beam, and Shmuel discusses when there is a beam.</p>
<p class="bas subject"><span class="nm">3)</span>DISTANCING TO PREVENT DAMAGE</p>
<p class="bas indent1"><span class="nm">(a)</span><span class="cl">(Mishnah):</span> A millstone's lower stone must be distanced three Tefachim. The upper stone will be four Tefachim away.</p>
<p class="bas indent1"><span class="nm">(b)</span><span class="cl">Question:</span> What is the reason?</p>
<p class="bas indent1"><span class="nm">(c)</span><span class="cl">Answer #1:</span> It makes the ground shake.</p>
<p class="bas indent1"><span class="nm">(d)</span><span class="cl">Objection (Beraisa):</span> The lower stone of a Chamor millstone (Rashi - it is driven by a donkey; Tosfos - one spins it using his feet, not his hands, or it rests on an edifice, and not on the ground) must be distanced three Tefachim. The upper stone must be distanced four Tefachim.</p>
<p class="bas indent2"><span class="nm">1.</span>A Chamor millstone does not make the ground shake!</p>
<p class="bas indent1"><span class="nm">(e)</span><span class="cl">Answer #2:</span> Rather, it is due to the noise.</p>
<p class="bas indent1"><span class="nm">(f)</span><span class="cl">(Mishnah):</span> The bottom of a Tanur (standard oven) must be distanced three Tefachim. The top will be four Tefachim away.</p>
<p class="bas indent1"><span class="nm">(g)</span><span class="cl">Inference (Abaye):</span> The bottom of a Tanur should extend a Tefach past the top (in each direction).</p>
<p class="bas indent2"><span class="nm">1.</span>This is relevant to commerce (if one sold a Tanur unlike this, it is a mistaken sale.)</p>
<p class="bas subject"><span class="nm">4)</span>THINGS THAT HARM AN UPPER STORY</p>
<p class="bas indent1"><span class="nm">(a)</span><span class="cl">(Mishnah):</span> One may not set up a Tanur in his house unless there are four Amos above it. One may not set up a Tanur in an upper story unless there are three Tefachim of plaster below it;</p>
<p class="bas indent2"><span class="nm">1.</span>For a Kirah (a rectangular oven, which does not get as hot as a Tanur), one Tefach suffices.</p>
<p class="bas indent1"><span class="nm">(b)</span>If the oven caused damage, he must pay for it;</p>
<p class="bas indent1"><span class="nm">(c)</span>R. Shimon says, if he kept the proper distance, he is exempt.</p>
<p class="bas indent1"><span class="nm">(d)</span><span class="cl">(Gemara) Contradiction (Beraisa):</span> A Tanur must have four Tefachim of plaster underneath. A Kirah must have three Tefachim.</p>
<p class="bas indent1"><span class="nm">(e)</span><span class="cl">Answer (Abaye):</span> The Beraisa discusses baker's ovens. A baker's Kirah is as hot as a standard Tanur.</p>
<p class="bas indent1"><span class="nm">(f)</span><span class="cl">(Mishnah):</span> One may not open a store...</p>
<p class="bas indent1"><span class="nm">(g)</span><span class="cl">(Beraisa):</span> If the pen preceded the storehouse, it is permitted.</p>
<p class="bas indent1"><span class="nm">(h)</span><span class="cl">Questions (Abaye):</span> If someone cleaned his roof (in order to store food there), but did not yet put food there, is this already considered a storehouse?</p>
<p class="bas indent2"><span class="nm">1.</span>If he opened new windows in his Aliyah (in order to store food there), what is the law? If he built an Aliyah (to be a storehouse), what is the law?</p>
<p class="bas indent1"><span class="nm">(i)</span>These questions are not resolved.</p>
<p class="bas indent1"><span class="nm">(j)</span><span class="cl">Question (Rav Huna brei d'Rav Yehoshua):</span> If he put in dates and pomegranates, is this considered a storehouse (or only if he puts in grain, wine or oil)?</p>
<p class="bas indent1"><span class="nm">(k)</span>This question is not resolved.</p>
<p class="bas indent1"><span class="nm">(l)</span><span class="cl">(Mishnah):</span> In truth, they permitted regarding wine...</p>
<p class="bas indent1"><span class="nm">(m)</span><span class="cl">(Beraisa):</span> They permitted (a baker's or dyer's store) under wine, because the smoke improves the wine, but not a pen, for the stench spoils the wine.</p>
<p class="bas indent1"><span class="nm">(n)</span><span class="cl">(Rav Yosef):</span> Even smoke of a candle harms wine of Bavel.</p>
<p class="bas indent1"><span class="nm">(o)</span><span class="cl">(Rav Sheshes):</span> (The heat and stench of) fodder harms wine just like a pen.</p>
<p class="bas subject"><span class="nm">5)</span>MAKING NOISE IN A CHATZER</p>
<p class="bas indent1"><span class="nm">(a)</span><span class="cl">(Mishnah):</span> If one set up a store in a Chatzer, others can stop him because the noise disturbs their sleep;</p>
<p class="bas indent2"><span class="nm">1.</span>Rather, he may make Kelim in the Chatzer and sell them in the market.</p>
<p class="bas indent2"><span class="nm">2.</span>If their sleep is disturbed by the noise of his hammer, millstone or children (coming to the store) they cannot complain.</p>
<p class="bas indent1"><span class="nm">(b)</span><span class="cl">Question:</span> What is the difference between the clauses?</p>
<p class="bas indent1"><span class="nm">(c)</span><span class="cl">Answer #1 (Abaye):</span> The Seifa teaches that people of another Chatzer cannot complain about the noise.</p>
<p class="bas indent1"><span class="nm">(d)</span><span class="cl">Objection (Rava):</span> If so, it should say so explicitly!</p>
<p class="bas indent1"><span class="nm">(e)</span><span class="cl">Answer #2 (Rava):</span> The Seifa discusses one who teaches Torah to children, after the enactment of Yehoshua ben Gamla.</p>
