<p class="bas subject"><span class="nm">1)</span>PROOFS OF FREEDOM</p>
<p class="bas indent1"><span class="nm">(a)</span><span class="cl">(R. Zeira):</span> If a slave married a Bas Yisrael in front of his master, he goes free.</p>
<p class="bas indent1"><span class="nm">(b)</span><span class="cl">Question (R. Yochanan):</span> This is unlike Chachamim!</p>
<p class="bas indent2"><span class="nm">1.</span><span class="cl">(Beraisa - R. Meir):</span> If a man wrote a document of Kidushin to his Shifchah, she is Mekudeshes;</p>
<p class="bas indent2"><span class="nm">2.</span>Chachamim say, she is not Mekudeshes.</p>
<p class="bas indent1"><span class="nm">(c)</span><span class="cl">Answer:</span> Rabah bar Rav Shilo taught that if a master put Tefilin on his slave, the slave is free. Similarly, if the master himself married off the slave, he is free.</p>
<p class="bas indent1"><span class="nm">(d)</span><span class="cl">Question:</span> It is absurd to say that (Chachamim hold that) a man would not cause his slave to sin (marry him off if he had not freed him), but he himself would sin (marry his Shifchah without freeing her)!</p>
<p class="bas indent1"><span class="nm">(e)</span><span class="cl">Answer (Rav Nachman bar Yitzchak):</span> The case is, he told her that the document of Kidushin should free her and be Mekadesh her to him.</p>
<p class="bas indent2"><span class="nm">1.</span>R. Meir holds that 'you are Mekudeshes to me' is a valid expression of freedom. Chachamim disagree.</p>
<p class="bas indent1"><span class="nm">(f)</span><span class="cl">(R. Yehoshua ben Levi):</span> A slave who dons Tefilin in front of his master goes free.</p>
<p class="bas indent1"><span class="nm">(g)</span><span class="cl">Question (Beraisa):</span> If the master borrowed from his slave, or made the slave a guardian, or if the slave donned Tefilin in front of his master, or read three verses in the Beis ha'Keneses in front of his master, he does not go free.</p>
<p class="bas indent1"><span class="nm">(h)</span><span class="cl">Answer (Rabah bar Rav Shilo):</span> He goes free if the master himself put Tefilin on the slave.</p>
<p class="bas subject"><span class="nm">2)</span>SLAVES WITHOUT MASTERS</p>
<p class="bas indent1"><span class="nm">(a)</span><span class="cl">(Rav Dimi citing R. Yochanan):</span> If a man said before he died that his heirs should not make his Shifchah work, we force them to free her.</p>
<p class="bas indent1"><span class="nm">(b)</span><span class="cl">Objection (R. Ami and R. Asi):</span> (If she is not freed,) her children are slaves. Why must the heirs free her? (It suffices that they not make her work!)</p>
<p class="bas indent1"><span class="nm">(c)</span><span class="cl">(Rav Shmuel bar Yehudah citing R. Yochanan):</span> If a man said before he died 'my Shifchah made me happy, my heirs should make her happy', we force them to make her happy. (If necessary, they free her.)</p>
<p class="bas indent1"><span class="nm">(d)</span><span class="cl">Question:</span> What is the reason?</p>
<p class="bas indent1"><span class="nm">(e)</span><span class="cl">Answer:</span> It is a Mitzvah to fulfill the request of the deceased.</p>
<p class="bas indent1"><span class="nm">(f)</span><span class="cl">Version #1 (Ameimar):</span> If Reuven declared his slave to be Hefker, there is no solution (for the slave to become a Yisrael).</p>
<p class="bas indent1"><span class="nm">(g)</span><span class="cl">Question:</span> What is the reason?</p>
<p class="bas indent1"><span class="nm">(h)</span><span class="cl">Answer:</span> Reuven does not (monetarily) own the slave, but regarding Isurim (i.e. the Isur to marry a Bas Yisrael), he is still considered Reuven's slave.</p>
<p class="bas indent2"><span class="nm">1.</span>Reuven cannot transfer (to the slave) ownership regarding Isurim.</p>
<p class="bas indent1"><span class="nm">(i)</span><span class="cl">Question (Rav Ashi):</span> Ula and R. Chiya bar Avin taught that he goes free, and needs a Get of freedom!</p>
<p class="bas indent1"><span class="nm">(j)</span><span class="cl">Answer (Ameimar):</span> He needs one , but he cannot get one .</p>
<p class="bas indent1"><span class="nm">(k)</span><span class="cl">Version #2 (Ameimar):</span> If Reuven was Mafkir his slave, and Reuven died, there is no solution.</p>
<p class="bas indent1"><span class="nm">(l)</span><span class="cl">Question:</span> What is the reason?</p>
<p class="bas indent1"><span class="nm">(m)</span><span class="cl">Answer:</span> After making him Hefker, Reuven did not (monetarily) own him. Regarding Isurim, he was still considered Reuven's slave.</p>
<p class="bas indent2"><span class="nm">1.</span>Reuven does not bequeath ownership regarding Isurim.</p>
<p class="bas indent1"><span class="nm">(n)</span><span class="cl">Question (Rav Ashi):</span> Rav Dimi (above, (a)) taught that the heirs can free a slave, even if they did not inherit monetary ownership!</p>
<p class="bas indent1"><span class="nm">(o)</span><span class="cl">Answer (Ameimar):</span> Rav Dimi is wrong. (He was refuted.)</p>
<p class="bas indent1"><span class="nm">(p)</span><span class="cl">Question (Rav Ashi):</span> Rav Dimi was wrong because the father did not say that they should free her. If he explicitly said that she should go free, we would force the heirs to free her!</p>
<p class="bas indent1"><span class="nm">(q)</span><span class="cl">Answer (Ameimar):</span> I hold that R. Yochanan never said (even your amended version of) what Rav Dimi said in his name. Rather, R. Yochanan taught like R. Shmuel bar Yehudah reported.</p>
<p class="bas subject"><span class="nm">3)</span>SLAVES INHERITED BY CHILDREN</p>
<p class="bas indent1"><span class="nm">(a)</span>A city of (Kena'ani) slaves was sold to a Nochri. Their new masters died; they came before Ravina.</p>
<p class="bas indent2"><span class="nm">1.</span><span class="cl">Ravina:</span> Ask the children of your original owners to write for you Gitin of freedom.</p>
<p class="bas indent2"><span class="nm">2.</span><span class="cl">Rabanan:</span> This is like Ameimar's case, and he says that there is no solution for such slaves!</p>
<p class="bas indent2"><span class="nm">3.</span><span class="cl">Ravina:</span> I hold like Rav Dimi.</p>
<p class="bas indent2"><span class="nm">4.</span><span class="cl">Rabanan:</span> Rav Dimi was refuted!</p>
<p class="bas indent2"><span class="nm">5.</span><span class="cl">Ravina:</span> Rav Dimi was wrong because the father did not say that they should free her. If he explicitly said that she should go free, we would force the heirs to free her!</p>
<p class="bas indent1"><span class="nm">(b)</span>The Halachah follows Ravina.</p>
<p class="bas indent1"><span class="nm">(c)</span>Two partners had a slave; one freed his half. The other feared lest Chachamim find out and force him to free his half. (There was an enactment to free half-slaves to enable them to marry.) To prevent this, he transferred ownership of his slave to his son, who was a minor (and unable to free him).</p>
<p class="bas indent1"><span class="nm">(d)</span><span class="cl">Rav Papa:</span> We do to him like he did. His scheme will backfire! Children love coins. Appoint a guardian, and tell him to get the child to agree to free the slave in exchange for some coins, and write a Get of freedom in the child's name.</p>

<p class="bas subject"><span class="nm">4)</span>THE PROPER WORDING OF A DOCUMENT OF TRANSFER</p>
<p class="bas indent1"><span class="nm">(a)</span><span class="cl">(Beraisa):</span> If a master said 'I made my slave a free man' or 'behold he is free', he is free;</p>
<p class="bas indent1"><span class="nm">(b)</span>Rebbi says, if he said 'I will free him', he acquires his freedom;</p>
<p class="bas indent1"><span class="nm">(c)</span>Chachamim say, he does not.</p>
<p class="bas indent1"><span class="nm">(d)</span><span class="cl">R. Yochanan:</span> In all of these cases, these words were written in a document.</p>
<p class="bas indent1"><span class="nm">(e)</span><span class="cl">(Beraisa):</span> If one said 'I gave my field to Ploni', 'it is given to Ploni' or 'behold, it is his', Ploni acquires it;</p>
<p class="bas indent1"><span class="nm">(f)</span>R. Meir says, if he said 'I will give it to Ploni', he acquires it;</p>
<p class="bas indent1"><span class="nm">(g)</span>Chachamim say, he does not.</p>
<p class="bas indent1"><span class="nm">(h)</span><span class="cl">R. Yochanan:</span> In all of these cases, these words were written in a document.</p>
<p class="bas subject"><span class="nm">5)</span>THE POWER OF ADMISSION</p>
<p class="bas indent1"><span class="nm">(a)</span><span class="cl">(Beraisa):</span> If Reuven said 'I freed Ploni, my slave', and Ploni denies this, we are concerned lest Reuven gave a Get of freedom to a third party to acquire on behalf of Ploni. (Therefore, Reuven must free him.)</p>
<p class="bas indent1"><span class="nm">(b)</span><span class="cl">If Reuven said:</span> 'I wrote and gave a Get of freedom to Ploni, my slave', and Ploni denies this, Ploni's admission is like 100 witnesses that he is not free. (Reuven can say that he erred, and reclaim his slave.)</p>
<p class="bas indent1"><span class="nm">(c)</span><span class="cl">(Beraisa):</span> If Reuven said 'I gave my field to Ploni', and Ploni denies this, we are concerned lest Reuven asked a third party to acquire on behalf of Ploni. (Ploni gets the field);</p>
<p class="bas indent1"><span class="nm">(d)</span>If Reuven said 'I wrote a document to give the field, and I gave the document to Ploni', and Ploni denies this, Ploni's admission is like 100 witnesses that he did not get it. (Reuven can say that he erred, and reclaim his field.)</p>
<p class="bas indent1"><span class="nm">(e)</span><span class="cl">Question:</span> Who eats the Peros (produce, if Reuven does not retract)?</p>
<p class="bas indent1"><span class="nm">(f)</span><span class="cl">Answer #1 (Rav Chisda):</span> Reuven eats them.</p>
<p class="bas indent1"><span class="nm">(g)</span><span class="cl">Answer #2 (Rabah):</span> We store the Peros with a third party.</p>
<p class="bas indent1"><span class="nm">(h)</span>They do not argue. If Ploni is alive, since he admitted that it is not his, Reuven eats the Peros;</p>
<p class="bas indent2"><span class="nm">1.</span>If Ploni is dead, Ploni's son could not make a meaningful admission, so the Peros are stored. (Perhaps witnesses will clarify the matter.)</p>
<p class="bas subject"><span class="nm">6)</span>BREAKING LIENS</p>
<p class="bas indent1"><span class="nm">(a)</span><span class="cl">(Mishnah):</span> If Shimon lent to Reuven money, and Reuven made his slave Tavi an Apotiki (collateral, with a guarantee that the loan may be collected from Tavi's value) and he freed him, letter of the law, Tavi owes nothing to his master;</p>
<p class="bas indent1"><span class="nm">(b)</span>There is an enactment for Tikun ha'Olam. We force the master to write a Get of freedom, and Tavi writes a document obligating himself to pay his value to his master;</p>
<p class="bas indent1"><span class="nm">(c)</span>R. Shimon ben Gamliel says, only the one who freed him writes.</p>
<p class="bas indent1"><span class="nm">(d)</span><span class="cl">(Gemara) Question:</span> Who freed him?</p>
<p class="bas indent1"><span class="nm">(e)</span><span class="cl">Answer #1 (Rav):</span> Reuven freed him. Letter of the law, Tavi owes nothing to his second master (Shimon, who should have received him), due to Rava's law.</p>
<p class="bas indent2"><span class="nm">1.</span><span class="cl">(Rava):</span> The following uproot a lien:</p>
<p class="bas indent3"><span class="nm">i.</span>The borrower made the collateral Hekdesh;</p>
<p class="bas indent3"><span class="nm">ii.</span>The collateral was Chametz, and Pesach came (so one may not benefit from the Chametz);</p>
<p class="bas indent3"><span class="nm">iii.</span>The collateral was a slave, and the borrower freed him.</p>
<p class="bas indent2"><span class="nm">2.</span>We are concerned lest Shimon see Tavi and say 'you are my slave' (and people will say that Tavi is still a slave). Therefore, Chachamim enacted that Shimon write a Get of freedom, and Tavi owes his value to Shimon;</p>
<p class="bas indent2"><span class="nm">3.</span>R. Shimon ben Gamliel says, the slave does not obligate himself to pay his value, rather Reuven pays (to Shimon).</p>
