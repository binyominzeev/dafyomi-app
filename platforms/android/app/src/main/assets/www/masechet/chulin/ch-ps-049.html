<div class="subject"><span class="nm">1)</span><p>TO WHAT WE ATTRIBUTE PUNCTURES</p></div>
<div class="indent1"><span class="nm">(a)</span><p><span class="cl">Question:</span> Why is this different than the case of a needle found in the Beis ha'Kosos (a fold after the first stomach)?</p></div>
<div class="indent2"><span class="nm">1.</span><p>If a needle was found in the Beis ha'Kosos, if only one wall was punctured, it is Kosher. If both were punctured, it is Tereifah.</p></div>
<div class="indent2"><span class="nm">2.</span><p>We do not distinguish which way it is pointing!</p></div>
<div class="indent1"><span class="nm">(b)</span><p><span class="cl">Answer:</span> Since food and drink pass through the Beis ha'Kosos, perhaps they pushed (even the head of the needle) through.</p></div>
<div class="indent1"><span class="nm">(c)</span><p>A needle was found in the great chamber of the liver. Huna Mar brei d'Rav Idi ruled that it is Tereifah. Rav Ada bar Minyomi was Machshir.</p></div>
<div class="indent1"><span class="nm">(d)</span><p><span class="cl">(Ravina):</span> (Huna fed the animal to dogs.) He must compensate the owner (really, it was Kosher).</p></div>
<div class="indent1"><span class="nm">(e)</span><p><span class="cl">(Rav Kahana):</span> If a date pit was found in the gall bladder, it definitely came from the Kaneh (it is Kosher);</p></div>
<div class="indent2"><span class="nm">1.</span><p>Even though it is too big to leave the Kaneh by itself, when the animal moves, it becomes wedged in deeper and deeper, until eventually it leaves.</p></div>
<div class="indent1"><span class="nm">(f)</span><p>If an olive pit was found it is Tereifah, for it tears.</p></div>
<div class="indent1"><span class="nm">(g)</span><p><span class="cl">(R. Yochanan):</span> (The lung) is called Rei'ah because it improves Re'iyah (vision).</p></div>
<div class="indent2"><span class="nm">1.</span><p>This is only if it is eaten with herbs that improve vision.</p></div>
<div class="indent1"><span class="nm">(h)</span><p><span class="cl">Question:</span> If the lungs were punctured where the Shochet's hand goes, do we say that the Shochet caused the hole after Shechitah (and it is Kosher), or not?</p></div>
<div class="indent1"><span class="nm">(i)</span><p><span class="cl">Answer #1 (Rav Ada bar Noson):</span> We attribute it to the Shochet.</p></div>
<div class="indent1"><span class="nm">(j)</span><p><span class="cl">Answer #2 (Mar Zutra brei d'Rav Mari):</span> We do not.</p></div>
<div class="indent2"><span class="nm">1.</span><p>The law is, we attribute it to the Shochet.</p></div>
<div class="indent2"><span class="nm">2.</span><p><span class="cl">(Rav Mesharshiya):</span> This is reasonable, for if a wolf took the intestines and returned them punctured, we attribute the holes to the wolf.</p></div>
<div class="indent1"><span class="nm">(k)</span><p><span class="cl">Question:</span> If the lungs were punctured by a worm, do we assume that this happened after Shechitah?</p></div>
<div class="indent1"><span class="nm">(l)</span><p><span class="cl">Answer:</span> Rav Yosef bar Dosoy and Rabanan argued about this.</p></div>
<div class="indent2"><span class="nm">1.</span><p>The Halachah is, we assume that it happened after Shechitah.</p></div>
<div class="indent1"><span class="nm">(m)</span><p><span class="cl">(Mishnah - R. Shimon):</span> A punctured lung is Tereifah only if the hole goes to the chambers.</p></div>
<div class="indent1"><span class="nm">(n)</span><p><span class="cl">(Rabah bar Tachlifa):</span> He refers to the great chamber.</p></div>
<div class="indent1"><span class="nm">(o)</span><p><span class="cl">(Rav Acha bar Aba and Rav Bivi):</span> R. Maloch cited R. Yehoshua ben Levi to say that the Halachah follows R. Shimon.</p></div>
<div class="indent1"><span class="nm">(p)</span><p><span class="cl">(Rav Huna):</span> No, R. Yehoshua ben Levi says that the Halachah is not like R. Shimon.</p></div>
<div class="indent2"><span class="nm">1.</span><p><span class="cl">(R. Zeira):</span> R. Maloch and R. Yitzchak bar Ami said that the Halachah is not lke R. Shimon.</p></div>
<div class="indent2"><span class="nm">2.</span><p>The Halachah is not like R. Shimon.</p></div>
<div class="subject"><span class="nm">2)</span><p>A PUNCTURED STOMACH</p></div>
<div class="indent1"><span class="nm">(a)</span><p><span class="cl">(Mishnah):</span> If the Kevah was punctured (it is Tereifah).</p></div>
<div class="indent1"><span class="nm">(b)</span><p><span class="cl">(Rav Yitzchak bar Nachmani):</span> Kohanim (who receive the jaw, foreleg and Kevah of Chulin animals) eat the Chelev on the Kevah. This is like R. Yishmael, who permits it.</p></div>
<div class="indent1"><span class="nm">(c)</span><p>A way to remember (who permitted) is that Yishmael the Kohen helps Kohanim.</p></div>
<div class="indent1"><span class="nm">(d)</span><p><span class="cl">Question:</span> Where do we find that R. Yishmael helps Kohanim?</p></div>
<div class="indent1"><span class="nm">(e)</span><p><span class="cl">(Beraisa - R. Yishmael) Question:</span> "So you will bless Bnei Yisrael" teaches that the Kohanim bless Yisrael. What is the source that the Kohanim are blessed?</p></div>
<div class="indent2"><span class="nm">1.</span><p><span class="cl">Answer (R. Yishmael):</span> "I (Hash-m) will bless them."</p></div>
<div class="indent2"><span class="nm">2.</span><p>Question (R. Akiva) The Torah commands the Kohanim to bless Yisrael. What is the source that Hash-m blesses Yisrael?</p></div>
<div class="indent2"><span class="nm">3.</span><p><span class="cl">Answer:</span> "I (Hash-m) will bless them."</p></div>
<div class="indent1"><span class="nm">(f)</span><p><span class="cl">Question:</span> How does R. Akiva learn that the Kohanim are blessed?</p></div>
<div class="indent1"><span class="nm">(g)</span><p><span class="cl">Answer (Rav Nachman):</span> "(Hash-m told Avraham) I will bless those who bless you."</p></div>
<div class="indent1"><span class="nm">(h)</span><p><span class="cl">Question:</span> Why do we say that R. Yishmael helps Kohanim? (Also R. Akiva expounds that Hash-m blesses them!)</p></div>
<div class="indent1"><span class="nm">(i)</span><p><span class="cl">Answer:</span> R. Yishmael holds that Hash-m blesses them together with Yisrael. (This is better.)</p></div>
<div class="indent1"><span class="nm">(j)</span><p><span class="cl">(Beraisa - R. Yishmael):</span> "And all the Chelev on the Kerev (innards)" includes the Chelev on the small intestines;</p></div>
<div class="bbbline">49b----------------------------------------49b</p></div>
<div class="indent2"><span class="nm">1.</span><p>R. Akiva says, it comes to include the Chelev on the Kevah.</p></div>
<div class="indent1"><span class="nm">(k)</span><p><span class="cl">Contradiction (Beraisa - R. Yishmael):</span> "And the Chelev on (some texts read - The Chelev that covers) the Kerev" - just like the Chelev covering the Kerev is a membrane that can be peeled off, also all such Chelev (of a Shelamim is offered, and is forbidden to eat even in Chulin Behemos);</p></div>
<div class="indent2"><span class="nm">1.</span><p>R. Akiva says, just like the Chelev covering the Kerev is a membrane spread over it that can be peeled off, also all such Chelev (is offered in Kodshim and forbidden in Chulin).</p></div>
<div class="indent1"><span class="nm">(l)</span><p><span class="cl">Answer #1 (Ravin):</span> The opinions in the first Beraisa must be switched.</p></div>
<div class="indent2"><span class="nm">1.</span><p><span class="cl">Question:</span> Why not switch the opinions in the second Beraisa?</p></div>
<div class="indent2"><span class="nm">2.</span><p><span class="cl">Answer:</span> Since the second Beraisa details the opinions so precisely, presumably it is accurate.</p></div>
<div class="indent1"><span class="nm">(m)</span><p><span class="cl">Objection:</span> R. Yitzchak bar Nachmani taught that Kohanim were lenient like R. Yishmael!</p></div>
<div class="indent1"><span class="nm">(n)</span><p><span class="cl">Answer #2 (Rav Nachman bar Yitzchak):</span> R. Yishmael said in his father's name that the Chelev on the Kevah is permitted; he himself holds it is forbidden.</p></div>
<div class="subject"><span class="nm">3)</span><p>WHICH CHELEV CAN SEAL A HOLE</p></div>
<div class="indent1"><span class="nm">(a)</span><p><span class="cl">(Rav):</span> If Chelev that is permitted (to eat) seals a hole, it is as if there is no hole (regarding Tereifos). Forbidden Chelev does not seal a hole.</p></div>
<div class="indent1"><span class="nm">(b)</span><p><span class="cl">(Rav Sheshes):</span> Both types of Chelev can seal holes.</p></div>
<div class="indent1"><span class="nm">(c)</span><p><span class="cl">Question (R. Zeira):</span> Can Chelev covering the Kerev in a Chayah seal holes (according to Rav)?</p></div>
<div class="indent2"><span class="nm">1.</span><p>If we understand Rav very literally, all permitted Chelev seals. All forbidden Chelev does not seal. All Chelev of Chayos seals, for it is permitted;</p></div>
<div class="indent2"><span class="nm">2.</span><p>If Rav teaches that permitted Chalavim clings to the punctured organ, but forbidden Chalavim does not (presumably, this depends on which organ the Chelev covers), Chelev of the Kerev (even in a Chayah) does not cling to the Kerev.</p></div>
<div class="indent1"><span class="nm">(d)</span><p><span class="cl">Answer (Abaye):</span> This is obvious. Even though the Chelev is permitted, it does not cling.</p></div>
<div class="indent1"><span class="nm">(e)</span><p>An animal was brought in front of Rava. Forbidden Chelev covered a puncture.</p></div>
<div class="indent2"><span class="nm">1.</span><p><span class="cl">Rava:</span> The animal is permitted. We rely on Rav Sheshes' opinion. Also, the Torah is concerned for the money of Yisrael.</p></div>
<div class="indent2"><span class="nm">2.</span><p><span class="cl">Objection (Rav Papa):</span> We cannot be lenient about a Torah Isur because the Torah is concerned for the money of Yisrael!</p></div>
<div class="indent2"><span class="nm">3.</span><p>A man asked Rava about honey that had been exposed.</p></div>
<div class="indent2"><span class="nm">4.</span><p><span class="cl">Rava:</span> The honey is permitted. Firstly, a Mishnah teaches that only wine, water and milk become forbidden if exposed;</p></div>
<div class="indent3"><span class="nm">i.</span><p>Secondly, the Torah is concerned for the money of Yisrael!</p></div>
<div class="indent2"><span class="nm">5.</span><p><span class="cl">Objection (Rav Nachman bar Yitzchak):</span> The Torah's concern for the money of Yisrael does not override mortal danger and R. Shimon's opinion!</p></div>
<div class="indent3"><span class="nm">i.</span><p><span class="cl">(Beraisa):</span> The following liquids are not forbidden through exposure - brine, vinegar, fish oil, and honey.</p></div>
<div class="indent3"><span class="nm">ii.</span><p><span class="cl">R. Shimon:</span> They are forbidden. I saw a snake drinking brine!</p></div>
<div class="indent3"><span class="nm">iii.</span><p><span class="cl">Chachamim:</span> That was a deranged snake. Normal snakes do not drink these.</p></div>
<div class="indent2"><span class="nm">6.</span><p><span class="cl">Rava:</span> At least admit to me that brine does not become forbidden. Rav Papa and other Chachamim would put exposed liquids into brine to permit them!</p></div>
<div class="indent2"><span class="nm">7.</span><p><span class="cl">Rav Nachman bar Yitzchak:</span> Admit to me that honey becomes forbidden, for (not only R. Shimon, but also) R. Shimon ben Elazar forbids this.</p></div>
<div class="indent3"><span class="nm">i.</span><p><span class="cl">(Beraisa - R. Shimon ben Elazar):</span> Exposed honey is forbidden.</p></div>
<div class="indent1"><span class="nm">(f)</span><p><span class="cl">(Rav Nachman):</span> Chelev in the shape of a hat does not seal.</p></div>
<div class="indent2"><span class="nm">1.</span><p><span class="cl">Question:</span> To which Chelev does he refer?</p></div>
<div class="indent2"><span class="nm">2.</span><p><span class="cl">Answer #1:</span> He refers to Chelev at the end of the (large) intestines.</p></div>
<div class="indent2"><span class="nm">3.</span><p><span class="cl">Answer #2:</span> He refers to the Chelev over the heart.</p></div>
<div class="indent1"><span class="nm">(g)</span><p><span class="cl">(Rava):</span> Rav Nachman taught that either Chimtza or Bar Chimtza (two Chalavim on the Kevah) seals, but not both. I don't know which seals.</p></div>
<div class="indent1"><span class="nm">(h)</span><p><span class="cl">(Rav Chinena):</span> Only Bar Chimtza seals.</p></div>
<div class="indent1"><span class="nm">(i)</span><p><span class="cl">Question:</span> Which is Chimtza, and which is Bar Chimtza?</p></div>
<div class="indent1"><span class="nm">(j)</span><p><span class="cl">Answer:</span> We learn from Rav Nachman (below).</p></div>
