<p class="bas indent1"><span class="nm">(a)</span><span class="cl">Support (for Rava, regarding the child with a wallet - Beraisa):</span> If one was Motzi his garments folded on his shoulder and his sandals and rings in his hand, he is liable;</p>
<p class="bas indent2"><span class="nm">1.</span>If he was wearing them, he is exempt.</p>
<p class="bas indent2"><span class="nm">2.</span>If one was Motzi a clothed person with sandals on his feet and rings on his fingers, he is exempt;</p>
<p class="bas indent2"><span class="nm">3.</span>If he was Motzi the clothes, sandals and rings by themselves, he would be liable.</p>
<p class="bas indent1"><span class="nm">(b)</span><span class="cl">(Mishnah):</span> [One may carry] a basket with a rock inside.</p>
<p class="bas indent1"><span class="nm">(c)</span><span class="cl">Question:</span> The basket should be a Bosis for something forbidden (the rock)!</p>
<p class="bas indent1"><span class="nm">(d)</span><span class="cl">Answer (Rabah bar bar Chanah):</span> The case is, the basket is full of produce (it is primarily a Bosis for Heter).</p>
<p class="bas indent1"><span class="nm">(e)</span><span class="cl">Question:</span> [Why may he carry it with the rock -] he should spill out the produce and rock, and return the produce to the basket!</p>
<p class="bas indent1"><span class="nm">(f)</span><span class="cl">Answer:</span> We answer like R. Ilai answered [a different question, below] - the case is, the produce would get dirty.</p>
<p class="bas indent1"><span class="nm">(g)</span><span class="cl">Question:</span> He should shake the basket [to separate the rock from the produce, then shake the rock out]!</p>
<p class="bas indent1"><span class="nm">(h)</span><span class="cl">Answer (R. Chiya bar Ashi):</span> The case is, the rock plugs up a hole in the basket. (Tosfos Yeshanim is unsure whether or not we must still say that the basket holds produce that would get dirty.)</p>
<p class="bas indent1"><span class="nm">(i)</span><span class="cl">(Mishnah):</span> One may move Tamei Terumah [with Tahor...]</p>
<p class="bas indent1"><span class="nm">(j)</span><span class="cl">(Rav Chisda):</span> This is only if the Tahor Terumah is on bottom and the Tamei is on top - if the Tahor is on top, one must remove it and leave the Tamei in its place.</p>
<p class="bas indent1"><span class="nm">(k)</span><span class="cl">Question:</span> Even when the Tahor is on bottom, he should spill everything out and return the Tahor to the basket!</p>
<p class="bas indent1"><span class="nm">(l)</span><span class="cl">Answer (R. Ilai):</span> The case is, the produce would get dirty.</p>
<p class="bas indent1"><span class="nm">(m)</span><span class="cl">Question (Beraisa):</span> One may move Tamei Terumah with Tahor Terumah or Chulin, whether the Tahor is on top and the Tamei on bottom, or vice-versa.</p>
<p class="bas indent1"><span class="nm">(n)</span>Rav Chisda is refuted.</p>
<p class="bas indent1"><span class="nm">(o)</span><span class="cl">Answer (Rav Chisda):</span> The Mishnah discusses when one needs the Tahor Terumah itself (to eat it), the Beraisa discusses when he needs its place.</p>
<p class="bas indent1"><span class="nm">(p)</span><span class="cl">Question:</span> What forced Rav Chisda to establish the Mishnah when he needs the Tahor Terumah itself?</p>
<p class="bas indent1"><span class="nm">(q)</span><span class="cl">Answer (Rava):</span> The Seifa (coming Mishnah) shows that Rav Chisda is correct!</p>
<p class="bas indent2"><span class="nm">1.</span><span class="cl">(Seifa):</span> If coins are on a pillow, he shakes the pillow and they fall off.</p>
<p class="bas indent2"><span class="nm">2.</span><span class="cl">(Rabah bar bar Chanah):</span> This is only if he needs the pillow itself  - if he needs its place, he may move it with the coins on it.</p>
<p class="bas indent2"><span class="nm">3.</span>Just as in the Seifa he needs the Heter itself, also in the Reisha!</p>
<p class="bas subject"><span class="nm">2)</span>FIXING <i>MEDUMA</i> ON SHABBOS</p>
<p class="bas indent1"><span class="nm">(a)</span><span class="cl">(Mishnah - R. Yehudah):</span> We may even Ma'aleh Meduma...</p>
<p class="bas indent1"><span class="nm">(b)</span><span class="cl">Question:</span> Why is this permitted - he fixes (permits) the Meduma!</p>
<p class="bas indent1"><span class="nm">(c)</span><span class="cl">Answer #1:</span> R. Yehudah holds like R. Eliezer, who considers the Terumah to be by itself (not mixed in, whatever is removed is the Terumah):</p>
<p class="bas indent2"><span class="nm">1.</span><span class="cl">(Mishnah - R. Eliezer):</span> If one Se'ah of Terumah fell into less than 100 Sa'im of Chulin, and some of the mixture fell into other Chulin, it forbids like pure Terumah;</p>
<p class="bas indent2"><span class="nm">2.</span>Chachamim say, it forbids only according to the proportion of Terumah in the first mixture (we assume that it mixed uniformly).</p>
<p class="bas indent1"><span class="nm">(d)</span><span class="cl">Rejection:</span> This shows that R. Eliezer is stringent to assume that what was removed was the Terumah itself - this is no source to say that he assumes this to be lenient!</p>
<p class="bas indent1"><span class="nm">(e)</span><span class="cl">Answer #2:</span> R. Yehudah holds like R. Shimon (who assumes this to be lenient):</p>
<p class="bas indent2"><span class="nm">1.</span><span class="cl">(Mishnah):</span> If one Se'ah of Terumah fell into 100 Sa'im of Chulin, and before a Se'ah was removed another Se'ah of Terumah fell in, the mixture is forbidden (there are two Sa'im of Terumah and 100 of Chulin);</p>
<p class="bas indent2"><span class="nm">2.</span>R. Shimon permits (it is as if the first Terumah that fell was not mixed in).</p>
<p class="bas indent1"><span class="nm">(f)</span><span class="cl">Rejection:</span> No, perhaps this is the argument - the first Tana considers it as if both fell at the same time, the Chulin is only 50 times the Terumah; R. Shimon says that each is Batul the moment it falls in, each fell into 100 or (regarding the latter) 101 Chulin.</p>
<p class="bas indent1"><span class="nm">(g)</span><span class="cl">Answer #3:</span> R. Yehudah holds like R. Shimon ben Elazar:</p>
<p class="bas indent2"><span class="nm">1.</span><span class="cl">(Beraisa - R. Shimon ben Elazar):</span> One may intend to Ma'aleh Meduma from one area of the mixture and eat from the rest of it (before physically separating it. Since it is permitted without separating, separating is not considered Tikun.)</p>
<p class="bas indent1"><span class="nm">(h)</span><span class="cl">Question:</span> R. Yehudah does not hold like R. Shimon ben Elazar!</p>
<p class="bas bbbline">142b----------------------------------------142b</p>
<p class="bas indent2"><span class="nm">1.</span><span class="cl">(Beraisa - R. Yehudah):</span> We may Ma'aleh Meduma if there is 101 [in the mixture];</p>
<p class="bas indent2"><span class="nm">2.</span>R. Shimon ben Elazar says, he intends to Ma'aleh from one area and eats from the rest.</p>
<p class="bas indent1"><span class="nm">(i)</span><span class="cl">Answer:</span> Indeed, R. Yehudah is more lenient than R. Shimon ben Elazar</p>
<p class="bas subject"><span class="nm">3)</span>REMOVING <i>ISUR</i> FROM <i>HETER</i> ON SHABBOS</p>
<p class="bas indent1"><span class="nm">(a)</span><span class="cl">(Mishnah):</span> If a rock is on a barrel, one tilts the barrel and the rock falls;</p>
<p class="bas indent1"><span class="nm">(b)</span>If [he cannot do so because] it is between other barrels, he picks it up and tilts it and the rock falls.</p>
<p class="bas indent1"><span class="nm">(c)</span>If coins are on a pillow, he shakes the pillow and they fall off.</p>
<p class="bas indent1"><span class="nm">(d)</span>If there was filth on the pillow, he may clean it with a rag;</p>
<p class="bas indent2"><span class="nm">1.</span>If it is of leather, he may pour water on it until it is clean (but does not properly wash it).</p>
<p class="bas indent1"><span class="nm">(e)</span><span class="cl">(Gemara - Rav):</span> This is only if he forgot the rock - if he intentionally left it on, the barrel is a Bosis for Isur.</p>
<p class="bas indent1"><span class="nm">(f)</span><span class="cl">Question:</span> Who is our Tana, who says that whenever there is Heter and Isur we deal with the Heter, not with the Isur?</p>
<p class="bas indent1"><span class="nm">(g)</span><span class="cl">Answer (Rabah bar bar Chanah):</span> It is R. Shimon ben Gamliel:</p>
<p class="bas indent2"><span class="nm">1.</span><span class="cl">(Mishnah - Beis Shamai):</span> If one selects pulse (a legume) on Yom Tov, he selects the food and eats it;</p>
<p class="bas indent2"><span class="nm">2.</span>Beis Hillel say, he selects normally (Pesoles from the food,) but using his garment or a bowl;</p>
<p class="bas indent2"><span class="nm">3.</span><span class="cl">(Beraisa - R. Shimon ben Gamliel):</span> This is when there is more food than Pesoles - if there is more Pesoles, all agree that he selects the food and eats it (Rashi - for this is less exertion; R. Tam - in this case the Pesoles is Batul to the food).</p>
<p class="bas indent1"><span class="nm">(h)</span><span class="cl">Question:</span> In our Mishnah, there is more Heter (the barrel) than Pesoles - R. Shimon should permit to take the rock!</p>
<p class="bas indent1"><span class="nm">(i)</span><span class="cl">Answer:</span> Since he cannot take the barrel until removing the rock, it is as if there is more Pesoles.</p>
<p class="bas indent1"><span class="nm">(j)</span><span class="cl">(Mishnah):</span> If it is between other barrels, he picks it up...</p>
<p class="bas indent1"><span class="nm">(k)</span><span class="cl">(Beraisa - R. Yosi):</span> If the barrel was in a storehouse, or if there were glass Kelim nearby, he lifts the barrel and takes it elsewhere, then tilts it and the rock falls, then he takes what he needs and returns it to its place. (The final clause teaches that the barrel is not a Bosis at all, he may return it even if he has no further need for it.)</p>
<p class="bas indent1"><span class="nm">(l)</span><span class="cl">(Mishnah):</span> If coins are on a pillow...</p>
<p class="bas indent1"><span class="nm">(m)</span><span class="cl">(R. Chiya bar Ashi):</span> This is only if he forgot it - if he intentionally left it on, the pillow is a Bosis for Isur.</p>
<p class="bas indent1"><span class="nm">(n)</span><span class="cl">(Rabah bar bar Chanah):</span> This is only if he needs the pillow itself  - if he needs its place, he may move it with the coins on it.</p>
<p class="bas subject"><span class="nm">4)</span>CARRYING WITH A LOAF OR CHILD ON SHABBOS</p>
<p class="bas indent1"><span class="nm">(a)</span><span class="cl">(Mishnah):</span> If coins are on a pillow, he shakes...</p>
<p class="bas indent1"><span class="nm">(b)</span><span class="cl">(R. Oshaya):</span> If one forgot a wallet in a Chatzer, he puts a loaf or child on top of it and moves the wallet (with the loaf or child).</p>
<p class="bas indent1"><span class="nm">(c)</span><span class="cl">(Rav Yitzchak):</span> If one forgot a brick in a Chatzer, he puts a loaf or child on top of it and moves them together.</p>
<p class="bas indent1"><span class="nm">(d)</span><span class="cl">(Rav Yehudah bar Shila):</span> Once, a sack of coins was forgotten in Reshus ha'Rabim; R. Yochanan told them to put a loaf or child on top and move it [less than four Amos at a time; alternatively, they would make a wall of people around to permit carrying more than four Amos at a time].</p>
<p class="bas indent1"><span class="nm">(e)</span><span class="cl">(Mar Zutra):</span> The Halachah follows all of these teachings when the Muktzeh was forgotten.</p>
<p class="bas indent1"><span class="nm">(f)</span><span class="cl">(Rav Ashi):</span> It is forbidden even when it was forgotten - the leniency to put a loaf or child on top and carry applies only to a Mes [that might decay in the sun, on account of Kavod ha'Briyos].</p>
<p class="bas indent1"><span class="nm">(g)</span>Abaye would put a spoon on top of sheaves [to permit carrying them]; Rava would put a knife on top of a [raw, unsalted] dove.</p>
<p class="bas indent1"><span class="nm">(h)</span><span class="cl">Rav Yosef:</span> Chachamim only permitted for one who forgot, not to intend to move this way!</p>
<p class="bas indent1"><span class="nm">(i)</span><span class="cl">Abaye:</span> Really, I could move the sheaves by themselves, they are fitting to lie on - I am important, therefore I am stringent to put a spoon on top (lest people learn from me to be lenient).</p>
<p class="bas indent1"><span class="nm">(j)</span><span class="cl">Rava:</span> Really, I could move the dove by itself, it could be eaten raw - I am important, therefore I put a knife on top.</p>
