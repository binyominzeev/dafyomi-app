<div class="subject"><span class="nm">1)</span><p>HOW MAY WE DRY UP WET GROUND ON SHABBOS?</p></div>
<div class="indent1"><span class="nm">(a)</span><p><span class="cl">(Mishnah):</span> We spread salt on the ramp [to the Mizbe'ach], lest Kohanim slip;</p></div>
<div class="indent1"><span class="nm">(b)</span><p>We may use a Galgal (a wheel used to raise and lower a bucket on a rope) to draw water from [two pits in chambers surrounding the Azarah, i.e.] Bor ha'Golah and the great pit (perhaps this is where water from the Kiyor was left overnight, so it would not become Pasul through Linah) on Shabbos, and [outside the Mikdash] from Bor ha'Kar (this will be explained) on Yom Tov.</p></div>

<div class="indent1"><span class="nm">(f)</span><p><span class="cl">Answer #1 (Rav Ashi):</span> (He is not Mevatel it.) The salt is there when limbs [of an Olah] are brought up the ramp. This is not an Avodah. (Therefore we are not concerned for a Chatzitzah.)</p></div>
<div class="indent1"><span class="nm">(g)</span><p><span class="cl">Objection:</span> Bringing limbs up the ramp is an Avodah - "<i>v'Hikriv</i> ha'Kohen Es ha'Kol v'Hiktir ha'Mizbechah"!</p></div>

<div class="indent2"><span class="nm">1.</span><p><span class="cl">Suggestion:</span> It is forbidden because it produces sounds, and all sounds are forbidden!</p></div>

<div class="indent1"><span class="nm">(a)</span><p><span class="cl">(Mishnah - R.

<div class="indent1"><span class="nm">(b)</span><p>R. Yehudah says, he takes it out with wooden tongs, to avoid increasing the Tum'ah [to the garment. Wooden Kelim without a receptacle are not Mekabel Tum'ah.]</p></div>

<div class="indent1"><span class="nm">(d)</span><p><span class="cl">Answer #1 (Ben Nanas):</span> We must remove it from the Heichal, Ulam and between the Ulam and the Mizbe'ach;</p></div>

<div class="indent1"><span class="nm">(f)</span><p>If it is found elsewhere, we cover it with a Pesachter (a big bowl).</p></div>

<div class="indent1"><span class="nm">(i)</span><p><span class="cl">Question:</span> What is the reason?</p></div>
<div class="indent1"><span class="nm">(j)</span><p><span class="cl">Answer:</span> "Mi'Zachar Ad Nekevah Teshalechu" - the Mitzvah to expel Tum'ah applies to [people, and] anything [else] that can become Tahor in a Mikveh. This does not include a Sheretz.</p></div>
<div class="indent1"><span class="nm">(k)</span><p><span class="cl">Support (Beraisa - R. Yosi ha'Gelili):</span> "Mi'Zachar Ad Nekevah Teshalechu" excludes a Kli Cheres (earthenware).</p></div>

<div class="indent1"><span class="nm">(l)</span><p><span class="cl">Rejection:</span> No. Rather, the Mitzvah applies to things that can become an Av ha'Tum'ah (which is Metamei people and Kelim). This excludes a Kli Cheres.</p></div>
<div class="indent1"><span class="nm">(m)</span><p><span class="cl">Suggestion:</span> Tana'im argue about this:</p></div>
<div class="indent2"><span class="nm">1.</span><p><span class="cl">(Mishnah - R. Yochanan ben Brokah):</span> If a Sheretz was found in the Mikdash on Shabbos, a Kohen takes it outside in his garment, to avoid delaying the Tum'ah in the Mikdash [until wooden tongs can be found];</p></div>
<div class="indent2"><span class="nm">2.</span><p>R. Yehudah says, he takes it out with a wooden tongs, to avoid increasing the Tum'ah.</p></div>
<div class="indent2"><span class="nm">3.</span><p><span class="cl">Suggestion:</span> R. Yochanan ben Brokah forbids delaying the Sheretz in the Mikdash because he is Mechayev one who brings it in. R. Yehudah allows delaying it because he exempts one who brings it in!</p></div>

<div class="indent2"><span class="nm">2.</span><p><span class="cl">Suggestion:</span> Ben Nanas exempts one who enters a Sheretz; therefore he does not require removing it from the entire Azarah [only from the Heichal, etc. due to the honor of the Shechinah]. R. Akiva requires removing it from the entire Azarah because he is Mechayev one who brings it in.</p></div>
