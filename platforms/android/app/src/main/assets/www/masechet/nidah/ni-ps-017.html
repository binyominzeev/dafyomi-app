<p class="bas subject"><span class="nm">1)</span>SOME BAD OR DANGEROUS PRACTICES</p>
<p class="bas indent1"><span class="nm">(a)</span><span class="cl">(R. Shimon):</span> Hash-m hates four, and I do not love them:</p>
<p class="bas indent2"><span class="nm">1.</span>One who enters his own house suddenly, all the more so another's house;</p>
<p class="bas indent2"><span class="nm">2.</span>One who holds his Ever while urinating;</p>
<p class="bas indent2"><span class="nm">3.</span>One who urinates in front of his bed while he is naked;</p>
<p class="bas indent2"><span class="nm">4.</span>One who has Bi'ah in front of anything alive.</p>
<p class="bas indent1"><span class="nm">(b)</span><span class="cl">Question (Rav Yehudah):</span> Does R. Shimon scorn Bi'ah in front of mice?</p>
<p class="bas indent1"><span class="nm">(c)</span><span class="cl">Answer (Shmuel):</span> No. He refers to people who have Bi'ah in front of their slaves.</p>
<p class="bas indent1"><span class="nm">(d)</span><span class="cl">Question:</span> How do those people justify themselves?</p>
<p class="bas indent1"><span class="nm">(e)</span><span class="cl">Answer:</span> They expound "Shevu Lachem Po Im ha'Chamor" as if it said "Am ha'Chamor," i.e. slaves are like donkeys.</p>
<p class="bas indent1"><span class="nm">(f)</span>Rabah bar Rav Huna would ring a bell (Rashi - so people would go away and he could have Bi'ah in private; Tosfos - he would chase flies away);</p>
<p class="bas indent2"><span class="nm">1.</span>(Also) Abaye and Rava would chase away flies and mosquitoes.</p>
<p class="bas indent1"><span class="nm">(g)</span><span class="cl">(R. Shimon):</span> If one does any of the following five things, he is liable for endangering his own (in case 4, another's) life:</p>
<p class="bas indent2"><span class="nm">1.</span>One who eats one of the following that was left overnight -- a peeled garlic, onion or egg;</p>
<p class="bas indent2"><span class="nm">2.</span>One who drinks a mixed drink left overnight;</p>
<p class="bas indent2"><span class="nm">3.</span>One who stays overnight in a cemetery;</p>
<p class="bas indent2"><span class="nm">4.</span>One who cuts his nails and casts them into Reshus ha'Rabim;</p>
<p class="bas indent2"><span class="nm">5.</span>One who has Bi'ah after bloodletting.</p>
<p class="bas indent1"><span class="nm">(h)</span><span class="cl">(R. Shimon):</span> One who eats a peeled garlic, (onion or egg, endangers himself).</p>
<p class="bas indent2"><span class="nm">1.</span>Even if it is in a sealed Kli, Ru'ach Ra comes upon it.</p>
<p class="bas indent2"><span class="nm">2.</span>If any of the strands at the top (of a garlic or onion) or any part of the peel remains, there is no problem.</p>
<p class="bas indent1"><span class="nm">(i)</span><span class="cl">(R. Shimon):</span> One who drinks a mixed drink left overnight...</p>
<p class="bas indent1"><span class="nm">(j)</span><span class="cl">(Rav Yehudah (and R. Yochanan)):</span> This is only if it was in a metal Kli.</p>
<p class="bas indent2"><span class="nm">1.</span>Regarding this, natron (alum) is like metal.</p>
<p class="bas indent1"><span class="nm">(k)</span><span class="cl">(R. Shimon):</span> One who stays overnight in a cemetery...</p>
<p class="bas indent1"><span class="nm">(l)</span>He wants a Ru'ach of Tum'ah to come upon him. This is dangerous.</p>
<p class="bas indent1"><span class="nm">(m)</span><span class="cl">(R. Shimon):</span> One who cuts his nails and casts them into Reshus ha'Rabim...</p>
<p class="bas indent1"><span class="nm">(n)</span>We are concerned lest a pregnant woman walk over them and miscarry.</p>
<p class="bas indent2"><span class="nm">1.</span><span class="cl">Suggestion:</span> This is only if he cut with scissors both his fingernails and toenails, and if he did not cut anything afterwards.</p>
<p class="bas indent2"><span class="nm">2.</span><span class="cl">Rejection:</span> This is wrong. We are concerned in all cases.</p>
<p class="bas indent2"><span class="nm">3.</span><span class="cl">(Beraisa):</span> One who burns his nails is a Chasid. (It is harmful to burn something from one's body. Nevertheless, he does so to ensure that no damage will come to others.) One who buries them is a Tzadik. One who simply drops them is a Rasha.</p>
<p class="bas indent1"><span class="nm">(o)</span><span class="cl">(R. Shimon):</span> One who has Bi'ah after bloodletting...</p>
<p class="bas indent1"><span class="nm">(p)</span>It was taught that if one has Bi'ah after bloodletting, the resulting children will be weak;</p>
<p class="bas indent2"><span class="nm">1.</span>If he and his wife have Bi'ah after both let blood, the children will have Ra'asan. (This is a Sheretz in the brain that causes great weakness.)</p>
<p class="bas indent1"><span class="nm">(q)</span><span class="cl">(Rav):</span> This is only if he did not eat anything in between. If he did, there is no problem.</p>
<p class="bas subject"><span class="nm">2)</span>BI'AH DURING THE DAY</p>
<p class="bas indent1"><span class="nm">(a)</span><span class="cl">(Rav Chisda):</span> One may not have Bi'ah during the day -- "v'Ahavta l'Re'acha Kamocha."</p>
<p class="bas indent1"><span class="nm">(b)</span><span class="cl">Question:</span> How do we learn this from the verse?</p>
<p class="bas indent1"><span class="nm">(c)</span><span class="cl">Answer (Abaye):</span> Perhaps he will see something repulsive in her, and he will despise her.</p>
<p class="bas indent1"><span class="nm">(d)</span><span class="cl">(Rav Huna):</span> Yisraelim are holy. They have Bi'ah only at night.</p>
<p class="bas indent1"><span class="nm">(e)</span><span class="cl">(Rava):</span> In a dark house, it is permitted during the day.</p>
<p class="bas indent2"><span class="nm">1.</span>A Chacham is always permitted. He covers with his garment in order that it will be dark.</p>
<p class="bas indent1"><span class="nm">(f)</span><span class="cl">Question (Mishnah - Beis Shamai):</span> Or they have Bi'ah in front of a lamp...</p>
<p class="bas indent1"><span class="nm">(g)</span><span class="cl">Correction:</span> It means 'or she checks the Edim by a lamp.'</p>
<p class="bas indent1"><span class="nm">(h)</span><span class="cl">Question (Beraisa - Beis Shamai):</span> Even though Chachamim disparage Bi'ah in front of a lamp... (or they may have Bi'ah in front of a lamp).</p>
<p class="bas indent1"><span class="nm">(i)</span><span class="cl">Correction:</span> It means, even though Chachamim disparage checking an Ed in front of a lamp (sunlight is much better)...</p>
<p class="bas indent1"><span class="nm">(j)</span><span class="cl">Question (Beraisa):</span> Chachamim praised the household of Munbaz ha'Melech for three things. They would have Bi'ah during the day, they did Bedikos using cotton (some say - soft wool), and they considered snow to be able to become Tamei.</p>
<p class="bas indent1"><span class="nm">(k)</span><span class="cl">Correction:</span> They praised them for checking Edim during the day.</p>
<p class="bas indent1"><span class="nm">(l)</span><span class="cl">Support:</span> Presumably, this is correct. Even if Bi'ah during the day is permitted, it is not praiseworthy!</p>
<p class="bas indent1"><span class="nm">(m)</span><span class="cl">Rejection:</span> It is praiseworthy (if done for the right reason). At night, perhaps he will be sleepy, so she will not be appealing to him. (One of the nine Midos of despicable Bi'ah is when he despises her.)</p>
<p class="bas subject"><span class="nm">3)</span>THE MATERIAL TO USE FOR <i>EDIM</i></p>
<p class="bas indent1"><span class="nm">(a)</span><span class="cl">(Beraisa):</span> They did Bedikos using cotton.</p>
<p class="bas indent1"><span class="nm">(b)</span>This supports Shmuel.</p>
<p class="bas indent2"><span class="nm">1.</span><span class="cl">(Shmuel):</span> Only cotton or clean soft wool may be used for Bedikos.</p>
<p class="bas indent2"><span class="nm">2.</span><span class="cl">(Rav):</span> When I was in Eretz Yisrael, on Erev Shabbos I would hear people selling "cotton for bread" (a euphemism for Bi'ah, which Chachamim perform on Shabbos). Now, I understand.</p>
<p class="bas indent1"><span class="nm">(c)</span><span class="cl">(Rava):</span> Worn linen garments are good for Bedikah.</p>
<p class="bas indent1"><span class="nm">(d)</span><span class="cl">Question (d'Vei Menasheh - Beraisa):</span> We do not check with a red or black Ed, nor with linen, only with cotton or clean soft wool.</p>
<p class="bas indent1"><span class="nm">(e)</span><span class="cl">Answer #1:</span> We may not use flax, but garments made from it are permitted.</p>
<p class="bas indent1"><span class="nm">(f)</span><span class="cl">Answer #2:</span> D'Vei Menasheh forbids new linen garments. Rava permits old ones.</p>
<p class="bas indent1"><span class="nm">(g)</span><span class="cl">(Beraisa):</span> They considered snow to be Mekabel Tum'ah. (This is from Tosefta Taharos 2:3, according to the text of the Gra and others.)</p>
<p class="bas indent2"><span class="nm">1.</span><span class="cl">(Mishnah):</span> Snow is not a food or drink. (Without intent, it is Tahor);</p>
<p class="bas indent3"><span class="nm">i.</span>If one intended to eat it, it is not (our text; Me'iri - is) Mekabel Tum'ah like a food;</p>
<p class="bas indent3"><span class="nm">ii.</span>If one intended to drink it, it is Mekabel Tum'ah like a drink.</p>
<p class="bas indent2"><span class="nm">2.</span>If Tum'ah touches it, only the place (surface) it touches becomes Tamei. If part of it becomes Tahor (through touching it to a Mikveh), all of it becomes Tahor.</p>
<p class="bas indent1"><span class="nm">(h)</span><span class="cl">Question:</span> If only the surface becomes Tamei, why does it say that if part becomes Tahor, all becomes Tahor? This implies that all of if was Tamei. How can all of it become Tamei?</p>
<p class="bas indent1"><span class="nm">(i)</span><span class="cl">Answer (Abaye):</span> The case is, it was in an earthenware Kli that was Tamei. The Torah says that the entire interior becomes Tamei, even if it is full of mustard seeds. (If contact were needed to transfer Tum'ah, the seeds that touch the Kli would be Rishonim (l'Tum'ah), those that touch them Sheniyim, and those in the middle would be Tehorim!)</p>

<p class="bas subject"><span class="nm">4)</span>THE TWO SOURCES OF <i>DAM NIDAH</i></p>
<p class="bas indent1"><span class="nm">(a)</span><span class="cl">(Mishnah):</span> Chachamim compared the interior of a woman to a Cheder (room), Prozdor (corridor) and Aliyah (second story);</p>
<p class="bas indent2"><span class="nm">1.</span>Blood of the Cheder is Tamei. Blood of the Aliyah is Tahor;</p>
<p class="bas indent2"><span class="nm">2.</span>If blood is found in the Prozdor, the Safek (where it came from) is considered Tamei, for the Chazakah is that it came from the Makor (Cheder. more blood comes from there.)</p>
<p class="bas indent1"><span class="nm">(b)</span><span class="cl">(Rami bar Shmuel and R. Yitzchak brei d'Rav Yehudah, citing Rav Huna):</span> The Cheder is more internal, and the Prozdor is more external. The Aliyah is on top of them. A Lul (conduit) is open from the Aliyah to the Prozdor;</p>
<p class="bas indent2"><span class="nm">1.</span>If blood is found further inside than the Lul, the Safek (where it came from) is considered Tamei;</p>
<p class="bas indent2"><span class="nm">2.</span>If blood is found outside of the Lul, the Safek is considered Tahor. (Tosfos - we discuss blood found on the ceiling of the Prozdor.)</p>
<p class="bas indent1"><span class="nm">(c)</span><span class="cl">Rabah bar Rav Huna (to his father):</span> Did you indeed teach (that inside the Lul is) Safek Tamei? The Mishnah says that it is Muchzak to be Tamei!</p>
<p class="bas indent1"><span class="nm">(d)</span><span class="cl">Rav Huna:</span> I meant that further in than the Lul is definitely Tamei. Further out than the Lul is Safek Tamei.</p>
<p class="bas indent1"><span class="nm">(e)</span><span class="cl">Objection (Abaye):</span> Further out than the Lul is Safek Tamei, because we are concerned lest she bent over, and blood from the Cheder spurted to there;</p>
<p class="bas indent2"><span class="nm">1.</span>Likewise, further in than the Lul should be (only) Safek Tamei. We should be concerned lest she leaned back, and blood from the Aliyah spurted to there!</p>
<p class="bas indent1"><span class="nm">(f)</span><span class="cl">(Abaye):</span> Rather, there are two possibilities:</p>
<p class="bas indent2"><span class="nm">1.</span><span class="cl">Possibility #1:</span> If we are concerned lest blood spurted due to unusual postures, in both cases, she should be Safek Tamei;</p>
<p class="bas indent2"><span class="nm">2.</span><span class="cl">Possibility #2:</span> If we are not concerned, inside should be (definitely) Tamei, and outside should be Tahor!</p>
<p class="bas indent1"><span class="nm">(g)</span><span class="cl">(R. Chiya):</span> If blood was found in the Prozdor and afterwards she entered the Mikdash (b'Shogeg), she is liable (to bring a Korban), and we burn Terumah (that she touched).</p>
<p class="bas indent1"><span class="nm">(h)</span><span class="cl">(Rav Katina):</span> She is exempt for entering the Mikdash, and we do not burn Terumah.</p>
<p class="bas indent1"><span class="nm">(i)</span>Possibility #1 of Abaye is like Rav Katina. It argues with R. Chiya. Possibility #2 is like R. Chiya. It argues with Rav Katina.</p>
