<p class="bas subject"><span class="nm">1)</span><i>TUM'AH </i>AROUND A CORPSE</p>
<p class="bas indent1"><span class="nm">(a)</span><span class="cl">(R. Yitzchak):</span> R. Eliezer ben Yakov said, one who is within four Amos of a corpse becomes Tamei.</p>
<p class="bas indent1"><span class="nm">(b)</span><span class="cl">Support (Mishnah - Beis Shamai):</span> One standing in a Chatzer (courtyard) next to a cave of coffins is Tahor, provided that the Chatzer is four Amos (by four Amos);</p>
<p class="bas indent2"><span class="nm">1.</span>Beis Hillel say, he is Tahor if it is four Tefachim (handbreadths, by four Tefachim);</p>
<p class="bas indent2"><span class="nm">2.</span>This is only if the entrance to the Chatzer is from the top. If the entrance is from the side, all agree that it must be four Amos.</p>
<p class="bas indent2"><span class="nm">3.</span><span class="cl">Objection:</span> It should be the opposite! From the side, one can enter and leave without towering over the coffins. If the opening is at the top, one must spread his limbs when climbing down, and he will tower over the coffins!</p>
<p class="bas indent2"><span class="nm">4.</span><span class="cl">Correction:</span> Rather, Beis Hillel say four Tefachim only if the entrance to the Chatzer is from the side. If the entrance is from the top, all agree that it must be four Amos. (This supports R. Yitzchak, for Beis Hillel Metaher only because he is in an enclosed Chatzer. If not, he would become Tamei within four Amos.)</p>
<p class="bas subject"><span class="nm">2)</span>WHO DOES NOT FIGHT?</p>
<p class="bas indent1"><span class="nm">(a)</span><span class="cl">(Mishnah):</span> "Who is the man who was Mekadesh a woman..."</p>
<p class="bas indent1"><span class="nm">(b)</span><span class="cl">(Beraisa):</span> All of the following do not fight: one who was Mekadesh a virgin or a widow, and one to whom a Yevamah fell;</p>
<p class="bas indent2"><span class="nm">1.</span>Even if one of five brothers died in war, all the brothers return.</p>
<p class="bas indent1"><span class="nm">(c)</span>"He did not (yet fully) marry her" - this is one who was Mekadesh a woman forbidden to him, e.g. a widow to a Kohen Gadol, a divorcee or Chalutzah to a regular Kohen, a Mamzeres or Nesinah to a Yisrael, or vice-versa.</p>
<p class="bas indent1"><span class="nm">(d)</span><span class="cl">Suggestion:</span> The Beraisa is not like R. Yosi ha'Glili, who says that the (fearful and) softhearted person that returns is one who is afraid of his sins.</p>
<p class="bas indent2"><span class="nm">1.</span>R. Yosi ha'Glili would say that he returns for being Mekadesh a woman forbidden to him!</p>
<p class="bas indent1"><span class="nm">(e)</span><span class="cl">Rejection:</span> He can hold like R. Yosi ha'Glili. The Kidushin itself is not forbidden.</p>
<p class="bas indent2"><span class="nm">1.</span><span class="cl">(Rabah):</span> A Kohen Gadol who was Mekadesh a widow is not liable (for lashes) until he has Bi'ah with her. The Torah said "he will not Mekadesh her" in order that he should not come to profane (her and his children, through Bi'ah. Kidushin itself is not forbidden).</p>
<p class="bas indent1"><span class="nm">(f)</span><span class="cl">(Beraisa):</span> "Who built... who planted... who was Mekadesh" - the Torah teaches proper conduct, that one should first build a house and plant a vineyard, and then be Mekadesh a woman.</p>
<p class="bas indent2"><span class="nm">1.</span>We also learn this from Proverbs. "Prepare your work outside, and prepare a field for the future; afterwards, build your house."</p>
<p class="bas indent2"><span class="nm">2.</span><span class="cl">Explanation #1:</span> "Prepare your work outside" refers to a house. "Prepare a field for the future" is a vineyard. "Afterwards, build your house" is a wife.</p>
<p class="bas indent2"><span class="nm">3.</span><span class="cl">Explanation #2:</span> "Prepare your work outside" is (learning) written Torah. "Prepare a field for the future" is Mishnah. "Afterwards, build your house" is Gemara.</p>
<p class="bas indent2"><span class="nm">4.</span><span class="cl">Explanation #3:</span> "Prepare your work outside" is written Torah and Mishnah. "Prepare a field for the future" is Gemara. "Afterwards, build your house" are good deeds.</p>
<p class="bas indent2"><span class="nm">5.</span>R. Yosi ha'Glili says, "Prepare your work outside" is written Torah, Mishnah and Gemara. "Prepare a field for the future" are good deeds. "Afterwards, build your house" - expound in Torah and receive reward.</p>
<p class="bas indent1"><span class="nm">(g)</span><span class="cl">(Mishnah):</span> These do not return: one who built a gatekeeper's quarters...</p>
<p class="bas indent2"><span class="nm">1.</span><span class="cl">(Beraisa):</span> (Even R. Yehudah, who said that one who rebuilds his house as it was does not return, admits that) if he added on a row of bricks, he returns.</p>
<p class="bas indent1"><span class="nm">(h)</span><span class="cl">(Mishnah):</span> R. Eliezer says, even one who built a brick house in Sharon does not return.</p>
<p class="bas indent2"><span class="nm">1.</span><span class="cl">(Beraisa):</span> This is because the house must be rebuilt twice every seven years.</p>
<p class="bas indent1"><span class="nm">(i)</span><span class="cl">(Mishnah):</span> The following do not even go to the border: one who built a new house, and is in the first year of inauguration...</p>
<p class="bas indent1"><span class="nm">(j)</span><span class="cl">(Beraisa) Suggestion:</span> Perhaps "a new wife" refers only to a woman who was never married!</p>
<p class="bas indent1"><span class="nm">(k)</span><span class="cl">Rejection:</span> "Wife" includes even a widow or divorcee.</p>
<p class="bas indent1"><span class="nm">(l)</span><span class="cl">Question:</span> If so, why does it say "A new wife"?</p>
<p class="bas indent1"><span class="nm">(m)</span><span class="cl">Answer:</span> She must be new to him. This excludes one who remarried his ex-wife.</p>
<p class="bas indent1"><span class="nm">(n)</span><span class="cl">(Beraisa) Suggestion:</span> Perhaps "he will not go in the army", but he supplies water and food and fixes the roads!</p>
<p class="bas indent1"><span class="nm">(o)</span><span class="cl">Rejection:</span> "He will not pass (leave his wife) for anything."</p>
<p class="bas indent2"><span class="nm">1.</span><span class="cl">Suggestion:</span> Perhaps this applies even to one who built a house and did not inaugurate it, or planted a vineyard and did not redeem its fruit, or was Mekadesh a woman and did not have Nisu'in!</p>
<p class="bas indent2"><span class="nm">2.</span><span class="cl">Rejection:</span> "Him" - he does not pass, but others do.</p>
<p class="bas indent1"><span class="nm">(p)</span><span class="cl">Question:</span> Since it says "he will not pass", why must it say "he will not go in the army"?</p>
<p class="bas indent1"><span class="nm">(q)</span><span class="cl">Answer:</span> This forbids serving in the army with a second Lav.</p>
<p class="bas subject"><span class="nm">3)</span>THOSE WHO ARE AFRAID</p>
<p class="bas indent1"><span class="nm">(a)</span><span class="cl">(Mishnah - R. Akiva):</span> "The Shotrim will add on... one who fears, his heart is soft" means simply that he cannot stand in the thick of combat, to see a drawn sword;</p>
<p class="bas indent1"><span class="nm">(b)</span>R. Yosi ha'Glili says, this is someone who is afraid of his sins. Therefore, the Torah exempted one who built a house, planted a vineyard or was Mekadesh a woman, lest people know who is leaving because he has sinned.</p>
<p class="bas indent1"><span class="nm">(c)</span>R. Yosi says, a man married to a woman forbidden to him, e.g. a widow to a Kohen Gadol, a divorcee or Chalutzah to a regular Kohen, a Mamzeres or Nesinah to a Yisrael, or vice-versa, is the one who is afraid (of his sins).</p>
<p class="bas indent1"><span class="nm">(d)</span>When the Shotrim finish speaking, they appoint officers at the front and back of the army;</p>
<p class="bas indent2"><span class="nm">1.</span>They appoint valorous men at the front. Others are at the back, with iron arrows, and they are allowed to cut the legs of anyone who wants to go back.</p>
<p class="bas bbbline">44b----------------------------------------44b</p>
<p class="bas indent2"><span class="nm">2.</span>This is because falling is the beginning of fleeing - "Yisrael fled form the Philistines, and there was a great plague among the nation" (this will be explained);</p>
<p class="bas indent3"><span class="nm">i.</span>Also, "Yisrael fled form the Philistines, and their corpses fell."</p>
<p class="bas indent1"><span class="nm">(e)</span>All this applies to an optional war. In a war that is a Mitzvah, everyone goes to fight, even a Chasan from his room and a Kalah from the bridal canopy;</p>
<p class="bas indent1"><span class="nm">(f)</span>R. Yehudah says, all this applies to a war that is a Mitzvah; but in an obligatory war, everyone goes to fight, even a Chasan and a Kalah.</p>
<p class="bas indent1"><span class="nm">(g)</span><span class="cl">(Gemara) Question:</span> What do R. Yosi ha'Glili and R. Yosi argue about?</p>
<p class="bas indent1"><span class="nm">(h)</span><span class="cl">Answer:</span> R. Yosi ha'Glili says that even one who transgressed a Mitzvah mid'Rabanan does not fight. R. Yosi exempts only one who transgressed a Mitzvah mid'Oraisa.</p>
<p class="bas indent1"><span class="nm">(i)</span><span class="cl">Question:</span> Like whom is the following Beraisa?</p>
<p class="bas indent2"><span class="nm">1.</span><span class="cl">(Beraisa):</span> If one talked in between putting on the hand Tefilin and the head Tefilin, this is a sin, and it disqualifies him from fighting.</p>
<p class="bas indent1"><span class="nm">(j)</span><span class="cl">Answer:</span> It is like R. Yosi ha'Glili.</p>
<p class="bas indent1"><span class="nm">(k)</span><span class="cl">Question:</span> Like whom is the following Beraisa?</p>
<p class="bas indent2"><span class="nm">1.</span><span class="cl">(Beraisa):</span> If one is shaken when he hears horns sounding and shields clashing, and he wets his pants when swords are brandished, he returns from the army.</p>
<p class="bas indent2"><span class="nm">2.</span><span class="cl">Suggestion:</span> This is like R. Akiva. It is unlike R. Yosi ha'Glili.</p>
<p class="bas indent1"><span class="nm">(l)</span><span class="cl">Answer:</span> No, it is even like R. Yosi ha'Glili - "he will not soften his brothers' hearts like his own heart."</p>
<p class="bas indent1"><span class="nm">(m)</span><span class="cl">(Mishnah):</span> When the Shotrim finish...</p>
<p class="bas indent1"><span class="nm">(n)</span><span class="cl">Objection:</span> Falling is not the beginning of fleeing. Rather, fleeing is the beginning of falling!</p>
<p class="bas indent1"><span class="nm">(o)</span><span class="cl">Correction:</span> Indeed, that is the correct text of the Mishnah.</p>
<p class="bas indent1"><span class="nm">(p)</span><span class="cl">(Mishnah):</span> All this applies to an optional war...</p>
<p class="bas indent1"><span class="nm">(q)</span><span class="cl">(R. Yochanan):</span> What Chachamim call an optional war, R. Yehudah calls a Mitzvah. What Chachamim call a war of Mitzvah, R. Yehudah calls an obligatory war.</p>
<p class="bas indent1"><span class="nm">(r)</span><span class="cl">(Rava):</span> All agree that Yehoshua's war to conquer (the seven nations of Eretz Yisrael) was obligatory. All agree that David's war for additional territory was optional;</p>
<p class="bas indent1"><span class="nm">(s)</span>They argue about a war against Nochrim lest they attack us later. Chachamim call this optional, and R. Yehudah calls it a Mitzvah.</p>
<p class="bas indent2"><span class="nm">1.</span>According to R. Yehudah, one engaged in such a war is exempt form performing other Mitzvos that arise. According to Chachamim, he is obligated to do the other Mitzvos.</p>
<p class="perekline">PEREK EGLAH ARUFAH</p>
<p class="bas subject"><span class="nm">4)</span>EGLAH ARUFAH</p>
<p class="bas indent1"><span class="nm">(a)</span><span class="cl">(Mishnah):</span> The Parshah of Eglah Arufah (beheading a calf when a murdered body is found) is said in Hebrew, for it says "when you will find a corpse on the ground, your elders and judges will go out" (this will be explained).</p>
<p class="bas indent1"><span class="nm">(b)</span>Three judges of the great Sanhedrin in Yerushalayim go out;</p>
<p class="bas indent1"><span class="nm">(c)</span>R. Yehudah says, five go.</p>
<p class="bas indent2"><span class="nm">1.</span>"Your elders" teaches about two; "and judges" teaches about another two. We do not make an even Beis Din (i.e. with an even number of judges), so we add a fifth.</p>
<p class="bas indent1"><span class="nm">(d)</span>If the corpse is found covered in a mound, or hanging from a tree, or floating on the water, we do not bring it. The body must be "on the ground", not hidden; "that fell", not hanging from a tree; "in the field", not floating on the water.</p>
<p class="bas indent1"><span class="nm">(e)</span>If it is found near the border (of Eretz Yisrael), or near a city that is mostly Nochrim, or near a city without a Beis Din (of 23), they do not behead a calf; they only measure to a city that has a Beis Din.</p>
<p class="bas indent1"><span class="nm">(f)</span><span class="cl">(Gemara) Question:</span> How does the verse show that the Parshah is said in Hebrew?</p>
<p class="bas indent1"><span class="nm">(g)</span><span class="cl">Answer (R. Avahu):</span> It says "they will answer and say", like it says regarding the Berachos and curses on Har Gerizim and Har Eival. Just like those were in Hebrew, also Parshas Eglah Arufah;</p>
<p class="bas indent2"><span class="nm">1.</span>The continuation of the Mishnah (they will go out...) merely details the procedure of beheading the calf.</p>
<p class="bas indent1"><span class="nm">(h)</span><span class="cl">(Mishnah - R. Yehudah):</span> There are five judges...</p>
<p class="bas indent1"><span class="nm">(i)</span><span class="cl">(Beraisa - R. Yehudah):</span> "Your elders" teaches two; "and your " teaches two. We do not make an even Beis Din, so we add a fifth;</p>
<p class="bas indent1"><span class="nm">(j)</span>R. Shimon says, "Your elders" teaches two. We do not make am even Beis Din, so we add a third.</p>
<p class="bas indent1"><span class="nm">(k)</span><span class="cl">Question:</span> Why doesn't R. Shimon add two for "and your judges"?</p>
<p class="bas indent1"><span class="nm">(l)</span><span class="cl">Answer:</span> He uses that to teach that the most special of the judges go (i.e. from the great Sanhedrin).</p>
<p class="bas indent1"><span class="nm">(m)</span><span class="cl">Question:</span> What is R. Yehudah's source for this?</p>
<p class="bas indent1"><span class="nm">(n)</span><span class="cl">Answer #1:</span> It says "your elders", as opposed to 'elders'.</p>
<p class="bas indent1"><span class="nm">(o)</span><span class="cl">Question:</span> Why doesn't R. Shimon learn this way?</p>
<p class="bas indent1"><span class="nm">(p)</span><span class="cl">Answer, and objection to Answer #1:</span> R. Shimon holds that 'elders' connotes any old people. "Your elders" connotes members of any Sanhedrin. The Torah needed to say "and your judges" to teach that members of the great Sanhedrin must go. (This refutes the answer given for R. Yehudah!)</p>
<p class="bas indent1"><span class="nm">(q)</span><span class="cl">Answer #2:</span> R. Yehudah learns from a Gezeirah Shavah "elders-elders" from the judges who do Semichah (lean) on a Korban brought for a mistake of the great Sanhedrin.</p>
<p class="bas indent1"><span class="nm">(r)</span><span class="cl">Objection:</span> If so, he should learn five judges directly from there. What would he learn from "your elders" and "and your judges"?!</p>
<p class="bas indent1"><span class="nm">(s)</span><span class="cl">Answer #3:</span> Really, he learns like R. Shimon. However, he expounds "and (your judges)" to teach another two.</p>
<p class="bas indent2"><span class="nm">1.</span>R. Shimon does not expound "and."</p>
