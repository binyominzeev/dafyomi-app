<div class="subject"><span class="nm">1)</span><p>MITZVAH HABA'AH B'AVEIRAH</p></div>
<div class="indent1"><span class="nm">(a)</span><p>The Tana does not seem to differentiate between the first and second days of Yom Tov regarding a stolen Lulav.</p></div>
<div class="indent2"><span class="nm">1.</span><p><span class="cl">Question:</span> But the Torah singles out the first day for the obligation that the Lulav belong to the user!?</p></div>
<div class="indent2"><span class="nm">2.</span><p><span class="cl">Answer (R. Yochanan citing R. Shimon b. Yochai):</span> Because on all days it is a Mitzvah ha'Ba'ah b'Aveirah.</p></div>
<div class="indent3"><span class="nm">i.</span><p>Malachi connects the stolen offering with the lame and ill offering.</p></div>
<div class="indent3"><span class="nm">ii.</span><p>The defect of being stolen does not abate, just as the lame condition of the animal does not pass, even after the owner loses hope (Yiush).</p></div>
<div class="indent3"><span class="nm">iii.</span><p><span class="cl">Question:</span> While before Yiush we understand that the offering does not belong to the one bringing it; surely after Yiush it is his!?</p></div>
<div class="indent3"><span class="nm">iv.</span><p><span class="cl">Answer:</span> The invalidation must be Mitzvah ha'Ba'ah b'Aveirah.</p></div>
<div class="indent2"><span class="nm">3.</span><p>In a similar vein R. Shimon b. Yochai interprets the Pasuk wherein Hash-m despises theft in an Olah.</p></div>
<div class="indent3"><span class="nm">i.</span><p><span class="cl">Question:</span> Why single out an Olah?</p></div>
<div class="indent3"><span class="nm">ii.</span><p><span class="cl">Answer:</span> It is analogous to a King who pays taxes (which come right back to him) so that his servants will not learn to evade taxes; so, too, does Hash-m despise a stolen Olah, so that we might learn to avoid theft.</p></div>
<div class="indent2"><span class="nm">4.</span><p>R. Ami teaches explicitly that the defect of a stolen Lulav is Mitzvah ha'Ba'ah b'Aveirah.</p></div>
<div class="indent1"><span class="nm">(b)</span><p><span class="cl">(R. Yitzchak citing Shmuel):</span> One <i>does</i> fulfil one's obligation on the second day of Sukos with a stolen Lulav (since a borrowed Lulav may be used, so, too, a stolen Lulav).</p></div>
<div class="indent2"><span class="nm">1.</span><p><span class="cl">Question:</span> But our Mishnah prohibits a stolen Lulav and thus seems to permit a borrowed Lulav!?</p></div>
<div class="indent3"><span class="nm">i.</span><p>This could not be speaking on the first day of Sukos, where the Torah says Lachem (and a borrowed Lulav does not qualify)!</p></div>
<div class="indent3"><span class="nm">ii.</span><p>It must be speaking on subsequent days, and, still, a stolen Lulav is Pasul!</p></div>
<div class="indent2"><span class="nm">2.</span><p><span class="cl">Answer (Rava):</span> The Mishnah is speaking on the first day of Yom Tov.</p></div>
<div class="indent3"><span class="nm">i.</span><p>The Mishnah singles out a stolen Lulav not because a borrowed one is permitted.</p></div>
<div class="indent3"><span class="nm">ii.</span><p>To the contrary, we would naturally prohibit a borrowed one (which is not Lachem) but we might have permitted a stolen Lulav (by presuming that commonly the owners have lost hope).</p></div>
<div class="subject"><span class="nm">2)</span><p>METHODS FOR CHANGING OWNERSHIP IN THEFT</p></div>
<div class="indent1"><span class="nm">(a)</span><p>R. Huna told the merchants to have the gentile sellers cut the Hadasim (not the merchants).</p></div>
<div class="indent1"><span class="nm">(b)</span><p><span class="cl">Question:</span> Why would this be necessary?</p></div>
<div class="indent1"><span class="nm">(c)</span><p><span class="cl">Answer:</span> Since the gentile presumably stole the property (perhaps from a Jew).</p></div>
<div class="indent2"><span class="nm">1.</span><p>Since property does not change ownership by theft it may still belong to a Jew.</p></div>
<div class="bbbline">30b----------------------------------------30b</p></div>
<div class="indent2"><span class="nm">2.</span><p>Having the gentile clip the Hadasim results in the permitted combination of Yiush and change of ownership [Shinui Reshus].</p></div>
<div class="indent2"><span class="nm">3.</span><p>Thus the Yiush takes place in the hands of the gentile, and the Shinui Reshus is into the hands of the merchant.</p></div>
<div class="indent1"><span class="nm">(d)</span><p><span class="cl">Question:</span> It should be sufficient that the Yiush takes place as it is clipped by the merchant, and the Shinui Reshus takes place into the hands of the buyer!?</p></div>
<div class="indent1"><span class="nm">(e)</span><p><span class="cl">Answer:</span> Indeed, R. Huna was speaking to the merchants about acquiring their own Hadasim from the gentile.</p></div>
<div class="indent1"><span class="nm">(f)</span><p><span class="cl">Question:</span> Let Shinui Ma'aseh be sufficient (tying together of the Minim)!?</p></div>
<div class="indent1"><span class="nm">(g)</span><p><span class="cl">Answer:</span> R. Huna does not require that they be bound (and even if he does, such a binding does not create Shinui Ma'aseh since it can be readily undone).</p></div>
<div class="indent1"><span class="nm">(h)</span><p><span class="cl">Question:</span> Let Shinui Hash-m be sufficient (it was called a Asa [Hadas] and it is now Hoshana)!?</p></div>
<div class="indent1"><span class="nm">(i)</span><p><span class="cl">Answer:</span> It was commonly called Hoshana even before it was tied together with the Minim.</p></div>
