<p class="bas subject"><span class="nm">1)</span>GROUNDS FOR DIVORCE</p>
<p class="bas indent1"><span class="nm">(a)</span><span class="cl">(Mishnah - Beis Shamai):</span> One may divorce his wife only if "he found in her Ervah (immorality)";</p>
<p class="bas indent1"><span class="nm">(b)</span>Beis Hillel say, even if she burned the food, he may divorce her - "he found in her Ervas (or) Davar (a matter)";</p>
<p class="bas indent1"><span class="nm">(c)</span>R. Akiva permits even if he found a prettier woman - "if she does not find grace in his eyes."</p>
<p class="bas indent1"><span class="nm">(d)</span><span class="cl">(Gemara - Beraisa - Beis Hillel):</span> It says "matter" (it is permitted even if he did not find Ervah)!</p>
<p class="bas indent1"><span class="nm">(e)</span><span class="cl">Beis Shamai:</span> It says "Ervah"!</p>
<p class="bas indent1"><span class="nm">(f)</span><span class="cl">Beis Hillel:</span> Had it said only "Ervah", we would agree. Had it said only "Davar", one might have thought that one divorced due to a Davar (e.g. burning the food) may remarry; but one divorced due to Ervah may never remarry;</p>
<p class="bas indent2"><span class="nm">1.</span>Therefore, the Torah needed to say both.</p>
<p class="bas indent1"><span class="nm">(g)</span><span class="cl">Question:</span> What do Beis Shamai learn from "Davar"?</p>
<p class="bas indent1"><span class="nm">(h)</span><span class="cl">Answer:</span> They learn a Gezeirah Shavah "Davar-Davar." Just like we need two witnesses for monetary or bodily punishment, also to forbid a woman to her husband due to adultery.</p>
<p class="bas indent2"><span class="nm">1.</span><span class="cl">Beis Hillel:</span> If so, it should say "Ervah b'Davar"!"</p>
<p class="bas indent2"><span class="nm">2.</span><span class="cl">Beis Shamai:</span> The way you learn, it should say "Ervah or a Davar"!</p>
<p class="bas indent2"><span class="nm">3.</span><span class="cl">Beis Hillel:</span> The construct form "Ervas Davar" suggests that we learn both.</p>
<p class="bas indent1"><span class="nm">(i)</span><span class="cl">(Mishnah - R. Akiva):</span> Even if he found a prettier woman...</p>
<p class="bas indent1"><span class="nm">(j)</span>They argue about Reish Lakish's teaching.</p>
<p class="bas indent2"><span class="nm">1.</span><span class="cl">(Reish Lakish):</span> The word 'Ki' has four meanings: 'if', 'perhaps', 'rather', and 'because';</p>
<p class="bas indent2"><span class="nm">2.</span>Beis Shamai explain "she will not find grace in his eyes because he found Ervah in her."</p>
<p class="bas indent2"><span class="nm">3.</span>R. Akiva explains "whether she will not find grace in his eyes, (or) if he found Ervah in her."</p>
<p class="bas indent1"><span class="nm">(k)</span><span class="cl">Question (Rav Papa):</span> If he found neither Ervah nor a Davar (such as burning the food) and divorced her, what is the law?</p>
<p class="bas indent1"><span class="nm">(l)</span><span class="cl">Answer (Rava):</span> Regarding one who raped a woman, it says "he may not divorce her his entire life." (If he divorced her,) for the rest of his life he is commanded to remarry her;</p>
<p class="bas indent2"><span class="nm">1.</span>Here, it does not say that he must remarry her.</p>
<p class="bas subject"><span class="nm">2)</span>HOW TO TREAT ONE'S WIFE</p>
<p class="bas indent1"><span class="nm">(a)</span><span class="cl">Question (Rav Mesharshiya):</span> If a man cohabits with his wife, intending to divorce her, will he be punished (b'Yedei Shamayim)?</p>
<p class="bas indent1"><span class="nm">(b)</span><span class="cl">Answer (Rava):</span> Yes! "Do not plan evil against your companion who trusts you."</p>
<p class="bas indent1"><span class="nm">(c)</span><span class="cl">(Beraisa - R. Meir):</span> Just like people have different natures regarding food, also regarding women;</p>
<p class="bas indent2"><span class="nm">1.</span>Some people spill out their wine if a fly fell in. This corresponds to one who locks his wife in the house, so she won't speak with other men;</p>
<p class="bas indent3"><span class="nm">i.</span>This was the conduct of Papus ben Yehudah. (It caused enmity. His wife was Mezanah, and she gave birth to Yeshu.)</p>
<p class="bas indent2"><span class="nm">2.</span>Most people remove a fly that fell in the wine. Correspondingly, a normal man allows his wife to speak with her relatives;</p>
<p class="bas indent2"><span class="nm">3.</span>Some people suck the food off a fly that fell in their food. This corresponds to an evil man who does not protest when he sees his wife go out with uncovered hair, weave in public with her elbows exposed, or bathe with men.</p>
<p class="bas bbbline">90b----------------------------------------90b</p>
<p class="bas indent3"><span class="nm">i.</span><span class="cl">Objection:</span> This cannot be! (No one would let his wife bathe with men! Alternatively, the lewdest woman would not do so! Alternatively, this shows that she was Mezanah, surely he must divorce her.)</p>
<p class="bas indent3"><span class="nm">ii.</span><span class="cl">Correction:</span> Rather, she bathes where men bathe.</p>
<p class="bas indent2"><span class="nm">4.</span>It is a Mitzvah to divorce such a woman - "he found in her Ervah... he sent her from his house, and she married a different man."</p>
<p class="bas indent3"><span class="nm">i.</span>The Torah calls her next husband "different", for he is unlike the man who divorced her. The former expelled evil from his house, and the latter brings evil into his house.</p>
<p class="bas indent3"><span class="nm">ii.</span>The next husband deserves to be punished for this. If he merits, also he will divorce her. If not, he will die in her lifetime - "if the next husband...  will divorce her... or die."</p>
<p class="bas indent1"><span class="nm">(d)</span><span class="cl">(Rav Yehudah):</span> "For he hates, he sends" - one who hates his wife should divorce her;</p>
<p class="bas indent1"><span class="nm">(e)</span><span class="cl">(R. Yochanan):</span> This teaches that one who divorces his wife is hated.</p>
<p class="bas indent2"><span class="nm">1.</span>They do not argue. R. Yochanan discusses one's first Zivug (destined spouse), and Rav Yehudah discusses his second.</p>
<p class="bas indent2"><span class="nm">2.</span><span class="cl">(R. Elazar):</span> The Mizbe'ach cries over one who divorces his first wife - "the Mizbe'ach cries... because you betrayed your companion, the wife of your covenant."</p>
