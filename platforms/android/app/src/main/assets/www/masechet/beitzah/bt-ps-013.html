<div class="subject"><span class="nm">1)</span><p>CRACKING OPEN SHELLS OF SEEDS ON YOM TOV (cont.)</p></div>
<div class="indent1"><span class="nm">(a)</span><p><span class="cl">Answer:</span> Rava holds that our Mishnah is subject to a Machlokes Tana'im.</p></div>
<div class="indent2"><span class="nm">1.</span><p><span class="cl">(Tana Kama):</span> One who brought in sheaves of wheat with intent to make flour, may eat from them sporadically and is exempt from separating Terumah.</p></div>
<div class="indent2"><span class="nm">2.</span><p><span class="cl">(Rebbi):</span> If he brought them in with intent to roll them and eat the kernels, he is Chayav to separate Terumah (unlike the view of our Mishnah).</p></div>
<div class="indent2"><span class="nm">3.</span><p><span class="cl">(R. Yosi b. R. Yehudah):</span> He is exempt from separating Terumah (like our Mishnah).</p></div>
<div class="indent1"><span class="nm">(b)</span><p><span class="cl">Question:</span> How can our Mishnah be R. Yosi (who agrees that there is a case in which one may separate Terumah on Yom Tov)!?</p></div>
<div class="indent2"><span class="nm">1.</span><p>One brought in sheaves of wheat with intent to make flour, and then changed his mind and decided to roll them and eat the kernels.</p></div>
<div class="indent2"><span class="nm">2.</span><p>They become Tevel (obligated in Terumah) on Yom Tov.</p></div>
<div class="indent1"><span class="nm">(c)</span><p><span class="cl">Answer:</span> When the Mishnah says that Terumah cannot be separated on Yom Tov, it means <i>most</i> Terumah cannot be separated on Yom Tov (and thus the Mishnah can be in accordance with both Rebbi and R. Yosi, and Rava's statement is not problematic).</p></div>
<div class="subject"><span class="nm">2)</span><p>THE MACHLOKES BETWEEN REBBI AND R. YOSI REGARDING TEVEL (FIRST VERSION)</p></div>
<div class="indent1"><span class="nm">(a)</span><p><span class="cl">(Abaye):</span> The Machlokes (Rebbi and R. Yosi) applies only with sheaves of wheat, but everyone agrees that kernels of legumes become Tevel (and are obligated in Terumah) when one brings them inside in their bundles (since most people eat them in that state after cracking them open).</p></div>
<div class="indent1"><span class="nm">(b)</span><p><span class="cl">Question:</span> Shall the following Mishnah support Abaye?</p></div>
<div class="indent2"><span class="nm">1.</span><p>One who has bundles of Tilsan which are Tevel, may crush them (to remove the chaff), estimate how much of the mixture is seeds and how much is chaff, and separate Terumah on the estimated amount of seeds and not on the chaff.</p></div>
<div class="indent2"><span class="nm">2.</span><p>Say that the Mishnah is R. Yosi, who says that in the case of ears of wheat, bringing them in to roll and eat the kernels does not make them Tevel (such that Terumah must be separated), while in this case, bringing the bundles of Tilsan in to eat makes them Tevel.</p></div>
<div class="indent1"><span class="nm">(c)</span><p><span class="cl">Answer:</span> No, that Mishnah is Rebbi (and there is no proof that R. Yosi agrees in a case of kernels of legumes).</p></div>
<div class="indent1"><span class="nm">(d)</span><p><span class="cl">Question:</span> If it is Rebbi, why does it discuss bundles of Tilsan, when Rebbi holds that even ears of wheat become Tevel when brought in to eat?!</p></div>
<div class="indent1"><span class="nm">(e)</span><p><span class="cl">Answer:</span> Rather, it is R. Yosi.</p></div>
<div class="indent2"><span class="nm">1.</span><p><span class="cl">Question:</span> But if so, it should state its Din regarding other types of legumes, and then we would certainly know that Tilsan becomes Tevel?!</p></div>
<div class="indent2"><span class="nm">2.</span><p><span class="cl">Answer:</span> We might have obligated one to separate Terumah for all of the Tilsan (that even though the seed and the chaff taste the same nevertheless one only separates Terumah for the seeds).</p></div>
<div class="subject"><span class="nm">3)</span><p>THE MACHLOKES BETWEEN REBBI AND R. YOSI REGARDING TEVEL (SECOND VERSION)</p></div>
<div class="indent1"><span class="nm">(a)</span><p><span class="cl">(Abaye):</span> The Machlokes (Rebbi and R. Yosi) applies only with sheaves of wheat, but everyone agrees that kernels of legumes do not become Tevel (and are not obligated in Terumah) when one brings them inside in their bundles (since most people do not eat them in that state after cracking them open).</p></div>
<div class="indent1"><span class="nm">(b)</span><p><span class="cl">Question:</span> The following Mishnah seems to contradict Abaye?</p></div>
<div class="indent2"><span class="nm">1.</span><p>One who has bundles of Tilsan which are Tevel...</p></div>
<div class="indent2"><span class="nm">2.</span><p>Say that "Tevel" refers to Tevel of Terumah, and contradicts Abaye!</p></div>
<div class="indent1"><span class="nm">(c)</span><p><span class="cl">Answer:</span> No, "Tevel" there refers to Tevel of Terumas Ma'aser, and the Mishnah is referring to a case like that of R. Avahu in the name of Resh Lakish.</p></div>
<div class="indent2"><span class="nm">1.</span><p><span class="cl">(R. Avahu citing Resh Lakish):</span> When a Levi took Ma'aser Rishon from the sheaves (before they became obligated in Terumah which the Kohen gets), it is obligated in Terumas Ma'aser (even though it is still in an unfinished state of processing), because the status of Ma'aser Rishon obligates it in Terumas Ma'aser.</p></div>
<div class="indent2"><span class="nm">2.</span><p><span class="cl">Question:</span> If the case of the Mishnah is Tevel of Terumas Ma'aser, then why does the Mishnah say that one "crushes" the Tilsan (the Levi may say, "Just as I received it in its raw form, so shall I give it to the Kohen in its raw form.")?!</p></div>
<div class="indent2"><span class="nm">3.</span><p><span class="cl">Answer:</span> It is a penalty (for taking Ma'aser Rishon before Terumah was given to the Kohen).</p></div>
<div class="indent2"><span class="nm">4.</span><p>A Beraisa supports this, when it says that the Levi must give Terumas Ma'aser from the finished state, and not from the raw state.</p></div>
<div class="bbbline">13b----------------------------------------13b</p></div>
<div class="indent2"><span class="nm">5.</span><p><span class="cl">Question:</span> If the case of the Mishnah is Tevel of Terumas Ma'aser, then why does the Mishnah say that one <i>estimates</i> how much Terumah must be given (since Terumas Ma'aser requires an exact measuring)!?</p></div>
<div class="indent2"><span class="nm">6.</span><p><span class="cl">Answer:</span> That Mishnah follows Aba Elazar b. Gimel, who teaches (in a Beraisa) that Terumas Ma'aser may be given by estimation just as Terumah may be given by estimation.</p></div>
<div class="indent1"><span class="nm">(d)</span><p><span class="cl">Question:</span> What is the reason for the ruling of R. Avahu in the name of Resh Lakish?</p></div>
<div class="indent1"><span class="nm">(e)</span><p><span class="cl">Answer:</span> The Torah made the obligation of Terumah take effect whenever the produce acquires the title "Ma'aser."</p></div>
<div class="subject"><span class="nm">4)</span><p>MA'ASER RISHON WHICH WAS TAKEN BEFORE TERUMAH GEDOLAH</p></div>
<div class="indent1"><span class="nm">(a)</span><p><span class="cl">(Resh Lakish):</span> When a Levi took Ma'aser Rishon from the sheaves (before they became obligated in Terumah which the Kohen gets), that which he took is exempt from Terumah Gedolah (proof text).</p></div>
<div class="indent1"><span class="nm">(b)</span><p><span class="cl">Question:</span> Perhaps the verse is teaching that even when the Levi took Ma'aser Rishon from the piles (after they had become obligated in Terumah), that which he took is exempt from Terumah Gedolah?!</p></div>
<div class="indent1"><span class="nm">(c)</span><p><span class="cl">Answer:</span> Another verse states that the Levi must give to the Kohen all forms of Terumah that his portion of Ma'aser contains.</p></div>
<div class="indent1"><span class="nm">(d)</span><p><span class="cl">Question:</span> On the contrary, perhaps that verse obligates him to give Terumah Gedolah from the Ma'aser which he took even from the sheaves?!</p></div>
<div class="indent1"><span class="nm">(e)</span><p><span class="cl">Answer:</span> When the wheat has been piled, it acquires the title of "Dagan" (grain), which the Torah obligates in Terumah, while sheaves are not yet called "Dagan."</p></div>
<div class="subject"><span class="nm">5)</span><p>PEELING OFF SHELLS, WITH REGARD TO MA'ASEROS AND SHABBOS</p></div>
<div class="indent1"><span class="nm">(a)</span><p><span class="cl">(Mishnah):</span> One may peel barley kernels and eat them one at a time (and he does not have to separate Ma'aseros).</p></div>
<div class="indent1"><span class="nm">(b)</span><p>But if he peels them and collects them in his hand, he is obligated (to separate Ma'aseros).</p></div>
<div class="indent2"><span class="nm">1.</span><p><span class="cl">(R. Elazar):</span> That Mishnah also applies to Shabbos (one may peel the barley and eat it one at a time, but he may not collect them in a pile in his hand).</p></div>
<div class="indent2"><span class="nm">2.</span><p><span class="cl">Question:</span> But the wives of Rav and R. Chiya peeled cupfuls of barley for them on Shabbos!</p></div>
<div class="indent2"><span class="nm">3.</span><p><span class="cl">Answer:</span> Rather, R. Elazar's statement was said regarding the Seifa of the Mishnah there.</p></div>
<div class="indent3"><span class="nm">i.</span><p><span class="cl">(Mishnah):</span> One who rolls ears of wheat may blow them one at a time and eat them (and he does not have to separate Ma'aseros).</p></div>
<div class="indent3"><span class="nm">ii.</span><p>But if he rolls them and collects them in his lap, he is obligated (to separate Ma'aseros).</p></div>
<div class="indent3"><span class="nm">iii.</span><p><span class="cl">(R. Elazar):</span> That Mishnah also applies to Shabbos (one may roll the wheat and eat it one at a time, but he may not collect them in a pile in his lap).</p></div>
<div class="indent1"><span class="nm">(c)</span><p><span class="cl">Question:</span> In the Reisha of the Mishnah, how can peeling the barley obligate it in Ma'aseros (because it is the final Melachah), while be permitted on Shabbos (and not be considered a Melachah)?</p></div>
<div class="indent1"><span class="nm">(d)</span><p><span class="cl">Answer:</span> The laws of Ma'aser and of Shabbos are different, because the Isur of Melachah on Shabbos depends on doing a "Meleches Machsheves."</p></div>
<div class="indent2"><span class="nm">1.</span><p><span class="cl">(Mishnah):</span> When onions are collected in a pile, they become obligated in Ma'aseros.</p></div>
<div class="indent2"><span class="nm">2.</span><p>However, regarding Shabbos, one who collects onions in a pile is Patur.</p></div>
<div class="subject"><span class="nm">6)</span><p>HOW TO ROLL EARS OF WHEAT ON YOM TOV</p></div>
<div class="indent1"><span class="nm">(a)</span><p><span class="cl">Question:</span> How does one roll (on Yom Tov)?</p></div>
<div class="indent1"><span class="nm">(b)</span><p><span class="cl">Answer (Abaye):</span> Between the thumb and one finger.</p></div>
<div class="indent1"><span class="nm">(c)</span><p><span class="cl">Answer (R. Avya):</span> Between the thumb and two fingers.</p></div>
<div class="indent1"><span class="nm">(d)</span><p><span class="cl">Answer (Rava):</span> Since one is doing it with a Shinuy, it is permitted even between the thumb and all of the fingers.</p></div>
<div class="subject"><span class="nm">7)</span><p>BLOWING AWAY THE CHAFF ON SHABBOS</p></div>
<div class="indent1"><span class="nm">(a)</span><p><span class="cl">Question:</span> How does one blow away the chaff (on Shabbos)?</p></div>
<div class="indent1"><span class="nm">(b)</span><p><span class="cl">Answer (R. Ada b. Ahavah citing Rav):</span> He blows from the joints of his fingers and up (but not in his palms).</p></div>
<div class="indent1"><span class="nm">(c)</span><p>The Amora'im in Israel laughed in reaction to this opinion, because since one is doing it with a Shinuy, it should permitted even in the entire hand!</p></div>
<div class="indent1"><span class="nm">(d)</span><p><span class="cl">Answer (R. Elazar):</span> Rather, one may blow in one hand and with all of his strength.</p></div>
