<p class="bas subject"><span class="nm">1)</span>IS SPEAKING AN ACTION?</p>
<p class="bas indent1"><span class="nm">(a)</span><span class="cl">Question:</span> According to R. Yochanan, bending one's posture is an act. If so, also moving one's lips should be an act. Chachamim should not exempt Megadef from a Korban!</p>
<p class="bas indent1"><span class="nm">(b)</span><span class="cl">Answer (Rava):</span> Normally, moving one's lips is considered an act. Megadef is different, since the Isur is primarily (the intention) in his heart.</p>
<p class="bas indent1"><span class="nm">(c)</span><span class="cl">Question (R. Zeira - Beraisa):</span> Edim Zomemim are excluded (from bringing a Chatas) because they do not do an action.</p>
<p class="bas indent2"><span class="nm">1.</span>Testimony is "Al Pi" (through the mouth of) witnesses (yet it is not is considered an act)!</p>
<p class="bas indent1"><span class="nm">(d)</span><span class="cl">Answer #2 (Rava):</span> False testimony is different because it depends on Re'iyah (what they allegedly saw. Seeing is not an action. This is like our text, and Rashi. Tosfos - it depends on "Im (Lo Yagid)" they are liable only for testifying in Beis Din. If their speech was an action, they would be liable even outside. Rif (in Sanhedrin) - false testimony is different because it is possible through "Ayah". (If one witness testified, and we ask the other if he saw the same, it suffices for him to say the word "Ayah" (yes), which consists of gutteral sounds (made in the throat), he need not move his lips.)</p>
<p class="bas subject"><span class="nm">2)</span><i>CHELEV</i> OF DIFFERENT ANIMALS</p>
<p class="bas indent1"><span class="nm">(a)</span><span class="cl">(Mishnah):</span> One who eats Chelev (gets Kares).</p>
<p class="bas indent1"><span class="nm">(b)</span><span class="cl">(Beraisa - R. Yishmael):</span> "Kol Chelev Shor v'Chesev va'Ez Lo Sochelu" obligates separate Chiyuvim for Chelev of the three Kosher animals;</p>
<p class="bas indent1"><span class="nm">(c)</span>Chachamim say, he is liable only once.</p>
<p class="bas indent1"><span class="nm">(d)</span><span class="cl">Suggestion #1:</span> R. Yishmael holds that one is lashed (more than once) for Lav shebi'Chlalos (different Isurim forbidden by one Lav). Chachamim hold that one is not lashed (more than once) for Lav shebi'Chlalos.</p>
<p class="bas indent1"><span class="nm">(e)</span><span class="cl">Retraction - Suggestion #2:</span> R. Yishmael agrees that normally, one is not lashed for Lav shebi'Chlalos. Here is different, for there are extra words in the verse;</p>
<p class="bas indent2"><span class="nm">1.</span>It could have said just "Kol Chelev Lo Sochelu." Shor v'Chesev va'Ez are extra. Surely, this is to be Mechalek (a separate Chiyuv for Chelev of each)!</p>
<p class="bas indent2"><span class="nm">2.</span>Chachamim disagree. "Kol Chelev Lo Sochelu" would forbid even Chelev of Chayos. Therefore, it says Shor v'Chesev va'Ez to teach that only their Chelev is forbidden.</p>
<p class="bas indent1"><span class="nm">(f)</span><span class="cl">Question:</span> Chachamim's objection is strong. How can R. Yishmael argue?</p>
<p class="bas indent1"><span class="nm">(g)</span><span class="cl">Suggestion #3:</span> Rather, R. Yishmael says that it could have said just "(Kol Chelev) Shor (Lo Sochelu)." Kesev va'Ez are extra, to be Mechalek.</p>
<p class="bas indent1"><span class="nm">(h)</span>Chachamim disagree. Had it said just Shor, we would have learned a Gezeirah Shavah "Shor-Shor" from (the prohibition of animals to go on) Har Sinai (Rashi - from the Mitzvah to let one's animals rest on Shabbos) to include all animals and birds!</p>
<p class="bas indent2"><span class="nm">1.</span>Therefore, it says also Kesev va'Ez, to teach that other Chelev is permitted.</p>
<p class="bas indent1"><span class="nm">(i)</span><span class="cl">Question:</span> Chachamim's objection is strong. How can R. Yishmael argue?</p>
<p class="bas indent1"><span class="nm">(j)</span><span class="cl">Suggestion #4:</span> Rather, R. Yishmael says that it could have said just "Kesev," or just "Ez". It writes Shor v'Chesev va'Ez, to be Mechalek.</p>
<p class="bas indent1"><span class="nm">(k)</span>Chachamim argue. Had it said just Kesev, we would think that only sheep's Chelev is forbidden, for it has more Chelev offered to Hash-m, i.e. the tail, but Chelev of cattle and goats is permitted;</p>
<p class="bas indent2"><span class="nm">1.</span><span class="cl">(R. Chananya):</span> The Torah gives separate commands to burn Eimurim (the parts that are burned, e.g. the Chelev) of a Bechor Shor, Kesev and R. Eliezer. We could not have learned one from the others;</p>
<p class="bas indent3"><span class="nm">i.</span>Had the Torah taught only about a calf, we would have said that this is because it has larger Nesachim (six Lugim of wine. The Nesech for other Bechoros is only three Lugim);</p>
<p class="bas indent3"><span class="nm">ii.</span>Had it taught only about a lamb, we would have said that this is because its tail is offered, unlike other Bechoros;</p>
<p class="bas indent3"><span class="nm">iii.</span>Had it taught only about a goat, we would have said that this is because an individual who transgressed idolatry b'Shogeg must bring a goat for his Chatas.</p>
<p class="bas indent2"><span class="nm">2.</span><span class="cl">Suggestion:</span> True, we could not have learned one from any one of the others. Perhaps we could have learned one from the other two!</p>
<p class="bas indent2"><span class="nm">3.</span><span class="cl">Rejection - Question:</span> Which could be learned from the other two?</p>
<p class="bas indent3"><span class="nm">i.</span>We cannot learn a calf from the others, for they are valid for Korban Pesach;</p>
<p class="bas indent3"><span class="nm">ii.</span>We cannot learn a lamb from the others, for they are brought to atone for He'elem Davar of idolatry;</p>
<p class="bas indent3"><span class="nm">iii.</span>We cannot learn a goat from the others, for more is offered on the Mizbe'ach for them (more Nesachim, or the tail) than for a goat.</p>
<p class="bas indent2"><span class="nm">4.</span><span class="cl">Conclusion:</span> The Torah must teach all of these.</p>
<p class="bas indent1"><span class="nm">(l)</span><span class="cl">Question:</span> Chachamim's objection is strong. How can R. Yishmael argue?</p>
<p class="bas indent1"><span class="nm">(m)</span><span class="cl">Answer - Defense of Suggestion #2:</span> Really, it could have said just "Kol Chelev Lo Sochelu." (Shor v'Chesev va'Ez are extra to be Mechalek);</p>
<p class="bas indent2"><span class="nm">1.</span><span class="cl">Question:</span> Shor v'Chesev va'Ez are needed to permit Chelev of Chayos!</p>
<p class="bas indent2"><span class="nm">2.</span><span class="cl">Answer:</span> No. Since (Kares for) Chelev was written regarding Kodshim ("Chelev Min ha'Behemah Asher Yakriv Mimenu Isheh la'Shem"), we would know that also the Lav does not apply to Chayos.</p>
<p class="bas indent1"><span class="nm">(n)</span><span class="cl">Inference:</span> Chachamim (who do not use Shor v'Chesev va'Ez to be Mechalek, rather, to permit Chelev of Chayos) do not learn l'Fi Inyano (according to context)!</p>

<p class="bas indent2"><span class="nm">4.</span>R. Yishmael holds that it would have sufficed to write Shor v'Chesev (to teach that only Chelev common to cattle and sheep is forbidden);</p>

<p class="bas indent1"><span class="nm">(q)</span><span class="cl">(R. Chanina):</span> R. Yishmael (obligates multiple lashes for Chelev of different animals, but he) agrees that only one Korban is brought (for Shogeg).</p>
<p class="bas indent1"><span class="nm">(r)</span><span class="cl">Question:</span> What is the reason?</p>
<p class="bas indent1"><span class="nm">(s)</span><span class="cl">Answer:</span> The Isurim to eat Chelev are unlike those of Arayos (in which a separate Lav forbids each Ervah).</p>

<p class="bas indent1"><span class="nm">(a)</span><span class="cl">(Beraisa #1):</span> "V'Asah me'Achas me'Henah" obligates a Chatas for each transgression:</p>
<p class="bas indent2"><span class="nm">1.</span>If he ate Chelev twice, one Shem (type of Isur) in two Ha'alamos, or two Shemos in one He'elem, he brings one Chatas for each.</p>
<p class="bas indent1"><span class="nm">(b)</span><span class="cl">Question (Rami bar Chama):</span> I understand why he is liable twice for one Shem Isur in two Ha'alamos. The Ha'alamos are Mechalek;</p>
<p class="bas indent2"><span class="nm">1.</span>Why is he liable twice for two Shemos in one He'elem? There are not two Ha'alamos to be Mechalek!</p>
<p class="bas indent1"><span class="nm">(c)</span><span class="cl">Answer #1 (Rav Chisda):</span> The case is, he ate Chelev of Nosar. He is liable for Chelev and for Nosar.</p>
<p class="bas indent1"><span class="nm">(d)</span><span class="cl">Objection (Rami bar Chama):</span> If so, he should be liable also for eating Kodesh!</p>
<p class="bas indent1"><span class="nm">(e)</span><span class="cl">Answer #2 (Rav Sheshes):</span> The case is, he ate Chelev of Hekdesh. The Tana is R. Yehudah:</p>

<p class="bas bbbline">4b----------------------------------------4b</p>
<p class="bas indent2"><span class="nm">1.</span><span class="cl">Answer:</span> He did not, because R. Chanina taught that R. Yishmael agrees that only one Korban is brought.</p>
<p class="bas indent2"><span class="nm">2.</span>For the same reason, he should not establish it like R. Yehudah!</p>
<p class="bas indent3"><span class="nm">i.</span><span class="cl">(R. Elazar):</span> R. Yehudah agrees that only one Korban is brought.</p>
<p class="bas indent1"><span class="nm">(h)</span><span class="cl">Answer #3 (Reish Lakish):</span> The case is, he ate from two different pots. Beraisa #1 is like R. Yehoshua, who says that pots are Mechalek (even for Korban).</p>

<p class="bas indent2"><span class="nm">1.</span>R. Yehudah obligates three times for Chelev of Hekdesh.</p>
<p class="bas indent1"><span class="nm">(j)</span><span class="cl">Question (Rav Shizbi):</span> I understand R. Yehudah. The three lashes are for "Chukas Olam," "Kol Chelev Shor... ," and "v'Chol Zar Lo Yochal Kodesh";</p>
<p class="bas indent2"><span class="nm">1.</span>Why do Chachamim obligate only twice?</p>
<p class="bas indent1"><span class="nm">(k)</span><span class="cl">Answer (Rava):</span> They holds that "Chukas Olam" applies only to Kodshim, and "Kol Chelev Shor... " applies only to Chulin. Both of them are needed:</p>
<p class="bas indent2"><span class="nm">1.</span>Had the Torah taught only about Kodshim, we would have thought that the severity of Kodesh forbids Chelev Kodshim, but Chelev Chulin is permitted;</p>
<p class="bas indent2"><span class="nm">2.</span>Had the Torah taught only about Chulin, we would have thought that Chelev Chulin is forbidden because it is not Hutar mi'Chlalo (there is no Heter to its Isur);</p>
<p class="bas indent3"><span class="nm">i.</span><span class="cl">Version #1 (our text - Aruch la'Ner):</span> In Kodshim, the meat is Hutar mi'Chlalo (it is forbidden before Zerikah, and Zerikah permits it), so also Chelev is permitted (after Zerikah)!</p>
<p class="bas indent3"><span class="nm">ii.</span><span class="cl">Version #2 (Rashi):</span> Chelev Kodshim is Hutar mi'Chlalo (Alyah of sheep is considered Chelev, but Alyah of cattle and goats is permitted); so all Chelev Kodshim is permitted!</p>
<p class="bas indent3"><span class="nm">iii.</span><span class="cl">Version #3 (Shitah Mekubetzes #12, 13):</span> Chelev Kodshim is Hutar mi'Chlalo (it is permitted to the Mizbe'ach, even though it is not "mi'Mashkeh Yisrael"), so it is permitted (even to people)!</p>
<p class="bas indent2"><span class="nm">3.</span>Therefore, we need verses to forbid both.</p>
<p class="bas indent2"><span class="nm">4.</span>R. Yehudah learns l'Fi Inyano that "Kol Chelev Shor" (also) applies to Kodshim, for it is written regarding Kodshim.</p>
<p class="bas indent2"><span class="nm">5.</span><span class="cl">Inference:</span> Chachamim (who hold that that it applies only to Chulin) do not learn l'Fi Inyano!</p>

<p class="bas indent3"><span class="nm">i.</span>R. Yehudah learns a Lav from a Lav, or even a Lav from Kares;</p>

<p class="bas indent1"><span class="nm">(a)</span><span class="cl">(Beraisa - R. Yehudah):</span> "Kol Chelev v'Chol Dam Lo Sochelu" teaches that just like one is lashed twice for Chelev, also for blood.</p>
<p class="bas indent1"><span class="nm">(b)</span>Chachamim say, there is only one Lav for it.</p>
<p class="bas indent1"><span class="nm">(c)</span><span class="cl">Question:</span> R. Yehudah did not need a Hekesh to teach that one is lashed twice for Chelev, for two verses forbid it -- "Kol Chelev v'Chol Dam Lo Sochelu" and "Kol Chelev Shor... ";</p>
<p class="bas indent2"><span class="nm">1.</span>There are also two verses for blood, "Kol Chelev v'Chol Dam Lo Sochelu" and "v'Chol Dam Lo Sochlu." He should not need a Hekesh to teach that one is lashed twice for blood!</p>
<p class="bas indent1"><span class="nm">(d)</span><span class="cl">Correction:</span> Rather, R. Yehudah learns from the Hekesh that just like one is lashed three times for Chelev, also for blood.</p>
<p class="bas indent1"><span class="nm">(e)</span><span class="cl">Question:</span> He obligates three (sets of) lashes for Chelev without a Hekesh, for the above two verses and for Zarus (even a Kohen is a Zar regarding Chelev);</p>
<p class="bas indent2"><span class="nm">1.</span>Likewise, he should not need a Hekesh to teach that one is lashed three times for blood! (Similarly, all are Zarim regarding blood.)</p>
<p class="bas indent1"><span class="nm">(f)</span><span class="cl">Answer:</span> The Hekesh is needed;</p>
<p class="bas indent2"><span class="nm">1.</span>Since blood is excluded from Tum'ah (Rashi's text - Me'ilah), one might have thought that one is not liable for Zarus. The Hekesh teaches that this is not so.</p>
<p class="bas indent1"><span class="nm">(g)</span><span class="cl">Question:</span> What do Chachamim learn from the Hekesh?</p>
<p class="bas indent1"><span class="nm">(h)</span><span class="cl">Answer (Beraisa):</span> "Kol Chelev v'Chol Dam Lo Sochelu" - just like Chelev is (forbidden) unlike meat (of Tahor animals), and does not join (with meat, to be liable for eating a Shi'ur), also blood;</p>
<p class="bas indent2"><span class="nm">1.</span>This excludes blood of Sheratzim, for the same Isur forbids their blood and flesh, therefore they join.</p>
<p class="bas indent1"><span class="nm">(i)</span><span class="cl">Question:</span> We learn this from a different source!</p>
<p class="bas indent2"><span class="nm">1.</span>"V'Zeh Lachem ha'Tamei" teaches that blood of Sheratzim joins with Sheratzim.</p>
<p class="bas indent1"><span class="nm">(j)</span><span class="cl">Answer:</span> One might have thought that they join only for Tum'ah. The Hekesh teaches that they join even for Isur.</p>
<p class="bas indent1"><span class="nm">(k)</span><span class="cl">(Ravina):</span> Therefore, blood of snakes joins with snakes.</p>
<p class="bas indent1"><span class="nm">(l)</span><span class="cl">Question:</span> What is the Chidush? We learn this from the Hekesh!</p>
<p class="bas indent1"><span class="nm">(m)</span><span class="cl">Answer:</span> One might have thought that since blood of Sheratzim is Tamei like Sheratzim, it joins with the flesh, but snakes and their blood are not Teme'im, so the blood would not join;</p>
<p class="bas indent2"><span class="nm">1.</span>Ravina teaches that this is not so. The Hekesh applies whenever the blood and flesh are not different.</p>
<p class="bas indent1"><span class="nm">(n)</span><span class="cl">Question (Rava):</span> What do we learn from the three Kerisos written regarding blood?</p>
<p class="bas indent1"><span class="nm">(o)</span><span class="cl">Answer #1:</span> One is for Dam Chulin, one is for Dam Kodshim, and one is for Dam Tamtzis (blood that exudes before or after Dam ha'Nefesh, i.e. what exudes while the animal is dying).</p>
<p class="bas indent1"><span class="nm">(p)</span><span class="cl">Objection:</span> This answers only for R. Yehudah. How do Chachamim explain the third Kares?</p>

<p class="bas indent2"><span class="nm">2.</span><span class="cl">Answer:</span> "Dam" teaches only about Dam ha'Nefesh, which is Mechaper (it is valid for Zerikah). "Kol Dam" includes Dam Chulin and Dam Tamtzis.</p>
<p class="bas indent1"><span class="nm">(r)</span><span class="cl">Answer #2:</span> Rather, one is for Dam Chulin, one is for Dam Kodshim, and one is for Dam Kisuy (blood of a slaughtered bird or Chayah. One might have thought that it is Batel to the earth it is buried in, even if it became exposed later. Rashi - this is like Chachamim. Shitah - it is even like R. Yehudah, for he includes only Dam Tamtzis from "Kol Dam". The Beraisa said that he includes also Dam Chulin. It was not precise.)</p>
<p class="bas indent1"><span class="nm">(s)</span><span class="cl">(Rava):</span> There are five Lavim regarding blood (that are not expounded for other laws).
