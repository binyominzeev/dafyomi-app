<div class="subject"><span class="nm">1)</span><p>A BEIS HAKENESES AND THE LAWS OF NEGA'IM (cont'd)</p></div>
<div class="indent1"><span class="nm">(a)</span><p><span class="cl">Alternate Answer #2:</span> They both do not have an apartment within; speaks of Kerachim (not subject to the laws of Nega'im), and one of Kefarim (subject to those laws).</p></div>
<div class="indent1"><span class="nm">(b)</span><p><span class="cl">Question:</span> But the Beraisa implies (in the opinion of R. Yehudah) that synagogues <i>are</i> subject to <i>Tum'as</i> Nega'im (even if they are of K'rachim)?!</p></div>
<div class="indent1"><span class="nm">(c)</span><p><span class="cl">Answer:</span> R. Yehudah meant all sanctified places.</p></div>
<div class="indent1"><span class="nm">(d)</span><p><span class="cl">Question:</span> What is the Machlokes Tana Kama and R. Yehudah?</p></div>
<div class="indent1"><span class="nm">(e)</span><p><span class="cl">Answer:</span> Over whether (R. Yehudah) or not (Tana Kama) Yerushalayim was apportioned to Shevatim.</p></div>
<div class="indent2"><span class="nm">1.</span><p>This parallels an earlier Machlokes Tanaim.</p></div>
<div class="indent2"><span class="nm">2.</span><p>The first Beraisa speaks of the parts of the Mikdash occupying the land of Binyamin and Yehudah, and of the Pious Binyamin yearning to contribute the land under the Mizbe'ach (and being compensated with the Aron).</p></div>
<div class="indent2"><span class="nm">3.</span><p>The second Beraisa speaks of Yerushalayim as belonging to the entire people, and the resultant prohibition on charging for hospitality there (and the obligations which Chazal placed on visitors, in return).</p></div>
<div class="indent1"><span class="nm">(f)</span><p><span class="cl">Question:</span> But a Beraisa limits the laws of Nega'im to homes which have highly specified ownership!?</p></div>
<div class="indent1"><span class="nm">(g)</span><p><span class="cl">Answer:</span> Rather, we should use the first answers.</p></div>
<div class="subject"><span class="nm">2)</span><p>HOW AND WHEN TO BE MECHANECH THE SUBSTITUTE KOHEN</p></div>
<div class="indent1"><span class="nm">(a)</span><p><span class="cl">Question:</span> How can we do the Chinuch for the substitute if the Pesul occurs after the Tamid Shel Shachar has already been brought by the first (no special Begadim to put on)?!</p></div>
<div class="indent1"><span class="nm">(b)</span><p><span class="cl">Answer:</span> The Avnet.</p></div>
<div class="indent1"><span class="nm">(c)</span><p><span class="cl">Question:</span> But what of the opinion that the Avnet which is worn by the Kohen Gadol on Yom ha'Kipurim is identical to that worn year-round by the regular Kohanim?</p></div>
<div class="indent1"><span class="nm">(d)</span><p><span class="cl">Answer (Abaye):</span> He puts on all 8 Begadim and turns the flesh on the fire (an act prohibited to a Zar).</p></div>
<div class="bbbline">12b----------------------------------------12b</p></div>
<div class="indent1"><span class="nm">(e)</span><p><span class="cl">Answer (R. Papa):</span> Doing the Avodah is [sufficient] Chinuch (as in the Beraisa regarding Keilim after Moshe's time).</p></div>
<div class="subject"><span class="nm">3)</span><p>THE COMPOSITION OF THE AVNET</p></div>
<div class="indent1"><span class="nm">(a)</span><p>There is a Machlokes Rebbi and R. Elazar b'R. Shimon whether the Avnet was Kilayim or only Pishtan.</p></div>
<div class="indent2"><span class="nm">1.</span><p>We attempt to adduce that Rebbi holds it is Kilayim.</p></div>
<div class="indent2"><span class="nm">2.</span><p>The Beraisa, which must speak on Yom ha'Kipurim, cites the Avnet as the only difference between the garments of the Kohen Gadol and of a regular Kohen.</p></div>
<div class="indent2"><span class="nm">3.</span><p>No, the Beraisa could be speaking year-round and is only drawing contrasts between like-garments of the Kohen Gadol and the regular Kohen.</p></div>
<div class="indent1"><span class="nm">(b)</span><p>Ravin taught that the Machlokes was if the Avnet of the regular Kohen was Kilayim (Rebbi) or Pishtan (R. Elazar).</p></div>
<div class="indent2"><span class="nm">1.</span><p>There was no Machlokes regarding the Avnet of the Kohen Gadol.</p></div>
<div class="indent2"><span class="nm">2.</span><p>The Avnet of the Kohen Gadol on Yom ha'Kipurim was surely Pishtan, and during the year it was Kilayim.</p></div>
<div class="indent1"><span class="nm">(c)</span><p>R. Nachman b. Yitzhok cited a supporting Beraisa wherein Rebbi teaches that the Avnet of the Kohen Gadol on Yom ha'Kipurim is unlike the Avnet of the regular Kohen.</p></div>
<div class="indent2"><span class="nm">1.</span><p>The Beraisa revolves around the word "Yilbash".</p></div>
<div class="indent2"><span class="nm">2.</span><p>R. Yehudah and R. Dosa argue over its interpretation.</p></div>
<div class="indent2"><span class="nm">3.</span><p>Rebbi gives two refutations to R. Dosa (our reason and a S'vara that an object of higher Kedushah should not be used for lesser).</p></div>
<div class="indent2"><span class="nm">4.</span><p>"Yilbash" (according to Rebbi) would then teach that the garments need not be brand new.</p></div>
<div class="indent2"><span class="nm">5.</span><p>R. Dosa is consistent with his opinion that the Begadim of a Kohen Gadol need not be placed in Genizah, but may only not be used for another Yom ha'Kipurim.</p></div>
<div class="subject"><span class="nm">4)</span><p>SUBSEQUENT TREATMENT OF THE REPLACEMENT KOHEN GADOL</p></div>
<div class="indent1"><span class="nm">(a)</span><p><span class="cl">(R. Meir):</span> Both Kohanim are treated as Kohanim Gedolim.</p></div>
<div class="indent1"><span class="nm">(b)</span><p><span class="cl">(R. Yosi):</span> The first is restored to his post, and the second cannot function as Kohen Gadol nor as a regular Kohen (citing an incident in support of his view).</p></div>
<div class="indent2"><span class="nm">1.</span><p>He cannot be a co-Kohen Gadol for fear of enmity.</p></div>
<div class="indent2"><span class="nm">2.</span><p>He cannot be a regular Kohen out of respect for his elevated status.</p></div>
<div class="indent1"><span class="nm">(c)</span><p><span class="cl">(Rabah bar bar Chanah citing R. Yochanan):</span> The Halachah follows R. Yosi.</p></div>
<div class="indent2"><span class="nm">1.</span><p>R. Yosi also holds that if he <i>does</i> function as a Kohen Gadol, his Avodah is Kesheirah.</p></div>
<div class="indent2"><span class="nm">2.</span><p>Here, too, in the name of Rav, the Halachah follows R. Yosi.</p></div>
