<p class="bas subject"><span class="nm">1)</span>APPEASING THE <i>GIV'ONIM</i></p>
<p class="bas indent1"><span class="nm">(a)</span><span class="cl">David:</span> Sha'ul died more than a year ago, so it is improper to eulogize him now. We can appease the Giv'onim.</p>
<p class="bas indent2"><span class="nm">1.</span><span class="cl">David:</span> "What can I do for you, to atone?"</p>
<p class="bas indent2"><span class="nm">2.</span><span class="cl">Giv'onim:</span> "We don't want silver or gold ... give us seven of Sha'ul's children, and we will hang them."</p>
<p class="bas indent2"><span class="nm">3.</span>David tried appeasing them; they refused.</p>
<p class="bas indent2"><span class="nm">4.</span><span class="cl">David:</span> There are three Simanim of Yisrael - they are merciful, have a sense of shame, and bestow Chesed.</p>
<p class="bas indent3"><span class="nm">i.</span>They are merciful - "He will give you mercy, and make you merciful";</p>
<p class="bas indent3"><span class="nm">ii.</span>They have shame - "In order that fear of Hash-m should be on your faces".</p>
<p class="bas indent3"><span class="nm">iii.</span>They bestow Chesed - "That he will command his children...(to do Tzedakah)"</p>
<p class="bas indent2"><span class="nm">5.</span>Whoever has these three Simanim is fitting to cling to Yisrael. (The Giv'onim do not, so we will not marry them - "the Giv'onim are not from Bnei Yisrael.")</p>
<p class="bas indent1"><span class="nm">(b)</span><span class="cl">Question:</span> "The king took ... Armon and Mefivoshes and five sons of Michal" - why did he take these?</p>
<p class="bas indent1"><span class="nm">(c)</span><span class="cl">Answer (Rav Huna):</span> He passed them in front of the Aron. Whomever the Aron absorbed would be killed; whomever the Aron expelled would live.</p>
<p class="bas indent1"><span class="nm">(d)</span><span class="cl">Question (Rav Chana bar Katina):</span> "The king had mercy on Mefivoshes ben Yehonason" (this shows that David decided)!</p>
<p class="bas indent1"><span class="nm">(e)</span><span class="cl">Answer #1:</span> He did not pass him in front of the Aron.</p>
<p class="bas indent1"><span class="nm">(f)</span><span class="cl">Objection:</span> Did he show favoritism?! (This is like killing someone else!)</p>
<p class="bas indent1"><span class="nm">(g)</span><span class="cl">Answer #2:</span> Rather, he passed him in front of the Aron and the Aron absorbed him. David requested mercy, and the Aron expelled him.</p>
<p class="bas indent1"><span class="nm">(h)</span><span class="cl">Objection:</span> Still, this is favoritism!</p>
<p class="bas indent1"><span class="nm">(i)</span><span class="cl">Answer:</span> Rather, he prayed that the Aron should not absorb him.</p>
<p class="bas indent1"><span class="nm">(j)</span><span class="cl">Question:</span> "Fathers will not die ... (and sons will not die due to the sins of their fathers)!"</p>
<p class="bas indent1"><span class="nm">(k)</span><span class="cl">Answer (R. Chiya bar Aba):</span> It is better to uproot a letter of the Torah (transgress) than to publicly desecrate Hash-m's name (if people will see that injustice to converts was not avenged).</p>
<p class="bas indent1"><span class="nm">(l)</span><span class="cl">Question:</span> "From the beginning of the harvest ... until the rain (the bodies were hanging)". It says "You may not let him (someone executed) hang overnight"!</p>
<p class="bas indent1"><span class="nm">(m)</span><span class="cl">Answer (R. Yochanan):</span> It is better to uproot a letter of the Torah in order to publicly sanctify Hash-m's name.</p>
<p class="bas indent2"><span class="nm">1.</span>Passersby would ask about the people hanging. They would learn that they were sons of kings who harmed converts.</p>
<p class="bas indent2"><span class="nm">2.</span><span class="cl">Passersby:</span> There is no nation as fit to cling to as Yisrael! If sons of kings are punished thusly, all the more so, commoners! If for harming converts thusly, for harming Yisrael all the more so!</p>
<p class="bas indent1"><span class="nm">(n)</span>Immediately, there were 150,000 new converts - "Shlomo had 70,000 workers carrying on the shoulder, and 80,000 quarrying in the mountain.</p>
<p class="bas indent1"><span class="nm">(o)</span><span class="cl">Question:</span> Perhaps these workers were Yisraelim!</p>
<p class="bas indent1"><span class="nm">(p)</span><span class="cl">Rejection:</span> "Shlomo did not give a slave from Yisrael".</p>
<p class="bas indent1"><span class="nm">(q)</span><span class="cl">Question:</span> Maybe they were just hired workers?</p>
<p class="bas indent1"><span class="nm">(r)</span><span class="cl">Retraction:</span> Rather, we learn from "And Shlomo counted ... ha'Gerim...150,000".</p>
<p class="bas subject"><span class="nm">2)</span>THE DECREE AGAINST THE <i>GIV'ONIM</i></p>
<p class="bas indent1"><span class="nm">(a)</span><span class="cl">Question:</span> David did not decree against the Nesinim. Moshe did - "From the woodchopper to the one who draws your water"!</p>
<p class="bas indent1"><span class="nm">(b)</span><span class="cl">Answer:</span> Moshe decreed only for his generation. David decreed for all generations.</p>
<p class="bas indent1"><span class="nm">(c)</span><span class="cl">Question:</span> Yehoshua decreed on them before David - "Yehoshua made them woodchoppers and water drawers for the congregation and the Mizbe'ach"!</p>
<p class="bas indent1"><span class="nm">(d)</span><span class="cl">Answer:</span> Yehoshua decreed only for when there is a Mikdash. David decreed even for when there is no Mikdash.</p>
<p class="bas bbbline">79b----------------------------------------79b</p>
<p class="bas indent1"><span class="nm">(e)</span>In Rebbi's day, they wanted to permit the Nesinim.</p>
<p class="bas indent1"><span class="nm">(f)</span><span class="cl">Rebbi:</span> We can permit our share, but who will permit the share of the Mizbe'ach?</p>
<p class="bas indent1"><span class="nm">(g)</span>This argues with R. Chiya bar Aba.</p>
<p class="bas indent2"><span class="nm">1.</span><span class="cl">(R. Chiya bar Aba):</span> Yisrael's share is always forbidden (until Yisrael permits it). The Mizbe'ach's share is forbidden only when there is a Mikdash.</p>
<p class="bas subject"><span class="nm">3)</span>YIBUM AND CHALITZAH OF A SERIS</p>
<p class="bas indent1"><span class="nm">(a)</span><span class="cl">(Mishnah - R. Yehoshua):</span> I heard that a Seris does Chalitzah, and one does Chalitzah to his widow; and a Seris does not do Chalitzah, and one does not do Chalitzah to his widow. I cannot explain these.</p>
<p class="bas indent1"><span class="nm">(b)</span><span class="cl">R. Akiva:</span> I will explain! A Seris Adam (castrated by man) does Chalitzah, and one does Chalitzah to his widow, because he was once able to have children. A Seris Chamah (from birth) does not do Chalitzah, and one does not do Chalitzah to his widow, since he was always sterile;</p>
<p class="bas indent1"><span class="nm">(c)</span><span class="cl">R. Eliezer:</span> No. Rather, a Seris Chamah does Chalitzah and one does Chalitzah to his widow, because he can be cured. A Seris Adam does not do Chalitzah and one does not do Chalitzah to his widow, since he cannot be cured.</p>
<p class="bas indent1"><span class="nm">(d)</span>R. Yehudah ben Besira testified about a Seris Adam in Yerushalayim named Ben Megosesa. His widow did Yibum, like R. Akiva's opinion.</p>
<p class="bas indent1"><span class="nm">(e)</span>A Seris does not do Chalitzah nor Yibum. Also an Ailonis does not.</p>
<p class="bas indent1"><span class="nm">(f)</span>If a Seris did Chalitzah, he did not disqualify her (from Kehunah). If he had Bi'ah with her, he disqualified her (since she is Eshes Ach without the Mitzvah of Yibum).</p>
<p class="bas indent1"><span class="nm">(g)</span>Similarly, if an Ailonis did Chalitzah she is not disqualified. If she had Bi'ah with the Yavam she is disqualified.</p>
<p class="bas indent1"><span class="nm">(h)</span><span class="cl">(Gemara) Question:</span> R. Akiva says that Chayavei Lavin are like Chayavei Kerisos, and Chayavei Kerisos do not do Chalitzah or Yibum!</p>
<p class="bas indent1"><span class="nm">(i)</span><span class="cl">Answer #1 (R. Ami):</span> The case is, she is a convert. R. Akiva holds like R. Yosi, who says that converts are not considered Kehal Hash-m (and are permitted to a Seris).</p>
<p class="bas indent2"><span class="nm">1.</span><span class="cl">Question:</span> If so, they should be allowed to do Yibum!</p>
<p class="bas indent2"><span class="nm">2.</span><span class="cl">Answer:</span> Indeed, they can! Since R. Yehoshua discussed Chalitzah, R. Akiva also discussed Chalitzah.</p>
<p class="bas indent2"><span class="nm">3.</span><span class="cl">Support (Mishnah):</span> R. Yehudah testified about a Seris Adam whose widow did Yibum, to fulfill the words of R. Akiva.</p>
<p class="bas indent1"><span class="nm">(j)</span><span class="cl">Objection (Rabah - Beraisa):</span> If Reuven is a Petzu'a Daka, Krus Shofchah, Seris Adam, or is too old to have children, he does Chalitzah or Yibum.</p>
<p class="bas indent2"><span class="nm">1.</span>If Reuven died leaving a widow, and a brother gave a Ma'amar or Get or did Chalitzah, it takes effect. If a brother did Yibum, he acquires her;</p>
<p class="bas indent2"><span class="nm">2.</span>If Reuven's brother died leaving a widow, and Reuven gave a Ma'amar, Get or did Chalitzah, it takes effect. If he did Yibum, he acquires her, but may not stay married - "A Petzu'a Daka or Krus Shofchah will not enter Kehal Hash-m".</p>
<p class="bas indent2"><span class="nm">3.</span>This shows that the widow is a Bas Yisrael!</p>
<p class="bas indent1"><span class="nm">(k)</span><span class="cl">Answer #2 (Rabah):</span> Rather, the case is, he became a Petzu'a Daka after she fell to Yibum.</p>
<p class="bas indent1"><span class="nm">(l)</span><span class="cl">Question (Abaye):</span> The Isur of Petzu'a Daka should discharge the Mitzvah of Yibum!</p>
<p class="bas indent2"><span class="nm">1.</span><span class="cl">(Mishnah - R. Gamliel):</span> (Leah fell to Yibum to a man married mid'Rabanan to her sister Rachel (a minor)). If Rachel does Mi'un, Leah may do Yibum. If not, Leah waits until Rachel grows up, and Leah is exempt because she is the Yavam's Achos Ishto.</p>
<p class="bas indent2"><span class="nm">2.</span>This shows that the Isur of Achos Ishto discharges the Mitzvah of Yibum. The same should apply to the Isur of Petzu'a Daka!</p>
<p class="bas indent1"><span class="nm">(m)</span><span class="cl">Answer (Rav Yosef):</span> The Tana holds like R. Akiva, according to the opinion that R. Akiva says that Mamzerim come only from Chayavei Lavin of Sher (kin), but not from other Chayavei Lavin.</p>
<p class="bas indent1"><span class="nm">(n)</span><span class="cl">Question:</span> Yibum is "To establish a name for his brother", and the men (in Rabah's Beraisa) cannot do this!</p>
<p class="bas indent1"><span class="nm">(o)</span><span class="cl">Answer (Rava):</span> If we required the Mes to be fertile when he died, Yibum would never apply, since he became a Seris Chamah right before he died (he was too weak to have children! Rather, it suffices that he was once able to have children.)</p>
<p class="bas indent1"><span class="nm">(p)</span><span class="cl">Question:</span> Rava's reasoning is difficult for R. Eliezer!</p>
<p class="bas indent1"><span class="nm">(q)</span><span class="cl">Answer:</span> A man does not become a Seris Chamah before death. He is just weak.</p>
