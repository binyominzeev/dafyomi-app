<p class="bas subject"><span class="nm">1)</span>WHO IS A <i>SERIS</i>?</p>
<p class="bas indent1"><span class="nm">(a)</span><span class="cl">Question:</span> What is a Seris Chamah?</p>
<p class="bas indent1"><span class="nm">(b)</span><span class="cl">Answer (R. Yitzchak bar Yosef):</span> It is one who was a Seris from birth.</p>
<p class="bas indent1"><span class="nm">(c)</span><span class="cl">Question:</span> How do we know that he was a Seris from birth?</p>
<p class="bas indent1"><span class="nm">(d)</span><span class="cl">Answer (Abaye):</span> When he urinates, it does not make an arch.</p>
<p class="bas indent1"><span class="nm">(e)</span><span class="cl">Question:</span> What causes a man to be a Seris Chamah?</p>
<p class="bas indent1"><span class="nm">(f)</span><span class="cl">Answer:</span> His mother baked in the heat of the afternoon, and drank mixed (some say - strong) beer.</p>
<p class="bas indent2"><span class="nm">1.</span><span class="cl">Rav Yosef:</span> I had heard my mother say, 'Anyone who was stricken from birth'. Now I know what she referred to.</p>
<p class="bas indent1"><span class="nm">(g)</span><span class="cl">Question:</span> We should be concerned lest he got better in the interim (and if he was once fertile, Yibum and Chalitzah apply to him)!</p>
<p class="bas indent1"><span class="nm">(h)</span><span class="cl">Answer:</span> Since he was and is a Seris at the beginning and the end, we are not concerned lest he was better in the middle.</p>
<p class="bas indent1"><span class="nm">(i)</span><span class="cl">Question (Rav Mari - Beraisa - R. Chanina ben Antigonus):</span> We check (a firstborn animal with a blemished eye) three times within 80 days. (We are concerned lest it improved in the middle!)</p>
<p class="bas indent1"><span class="nm">(j)</span><span class="cl">Answer:</span> We are concerned that one limb recovered in between, but not that the entire body did.</p>
<p class="bas indent1"><span class="nm">(k)</span><span class="cl">(Mishnah - R. Eliezer):</span> No, rather (a Seris Chamah does Chalitzah).</p>
<p class="bas indent1"><span class="nm">(l)</span><span class="cl">Contradiction (Mishnah - Beis Hillel):</span> If a 20-year old man did not bring two hairs, he proves that he is 20, and (that) he is a Seris. He does not do Chalitzah or Yibum;</p>
<p class="bas indent2"><span class="nm">1.</span>If a 20-year old woman did not bring two hairs, she proves that he is 20, and (that) she is an Ailonis. She does not do Chalitzah or Yibum;</p>
<p class="bas indent2"><span class="nm">2.</span>Beis Shamai says, the age for both of them is 18;</p>
<p class="bas indent2"><span class="nm">3.</span>R. Eliezer says like Beis Hillel (20) for a man and like Beis Shamai (18) for a woman, since women mature faster.</p>
<p class="bas indent1"><span class="nm">(m)</span><span class="cl">Answer #1 (Rami bar Dikuli):</span> R. Eliezer retracted his opinion.</p>
<p class="bas indent2"><span class="nm">1.</span><span class="cl">Question:</span> Which did he retract?</p>
<p class="bas indent2"><span class="nm">2.</span><span class="cl">Answer (Beraisa - R. Eliezer):</span> A Seris Chamah does Chalitzah and Chalitzah is done to his wife, because in Alexandria they have a cure for this.</p>
<p class="bas indent1"><span class="nm">(n)</span><span class="cl">Answer #2 (R. Elazar):</span> R. Eliezer did not retract. The Mishnah (of 18 and 20 years) discusses when they are considered adults to be punished for sins.</p>
<p class="bas subject"><span class="nm">2)</span>WHEN DOES A <i>SERIS</i> BECOME AN <i>ADULT</i>?</p>
<p class="bas indent1"><span class="nm">(a)</span><span class="cl">(Rav):</span> If one ate Chelev between the age of 12 and 18, then brought Simanim of being a Seris, and later brought hairs, (s)he becomes an adult retroactively. (Rashi, Tosfos - we discuss a female; Ramban - we discuss a male.)</p>
<p class="bas indent1"><span class="nm">(b)</span><span class="cl">(Shmuel):</span> (S)he was a minor when (s)he ate.</p>
<p class="bas indent1"><span class="nm">(c)</span><span class="cl">Question (Rav Yosef):</span> (R. Meir says that there is no fine for raping or enticing a minor.) According to Rav, R. Meir should say that there is a fine for an Ailonis (since retroactively she was a Na'arah)!</p>
<p class="bas indent1"><span class="nm">(d)</span><span class="cl">Answer (Abaye):</span> No, she jumps from being a minor to a Bogeres. She was never a Na'arah.</p>
<p class="bas indent1"><span class="nm">(e)</span><span class="cl">Rav Yosef:</span> I should merit that such teachings be said in my name!</p>
<p class="bas indent1"><span class="nm">(f)</span><span class="cl">Support (Beraisa):</span> A Seris cannot become a Ben Sorer u'Moreh (a rebellious son), because Ben Sorer u'Moreh applies after he brings hairs below. The laws of Na'arah Me'orasah do not apply to an Ailonis, since she jumps from being a minor to a Bogeres.</p>
<p class="bas indent1"><span class="nm">(g)</span><span class="cl">(R. Avahu):</span> One with signs of being a Seris or Ailonis is not considered an adult until 20. Until 20 years we do not consider a baby born after eight months of pregnancy (to be alive - Rashi; Nimukei Yosef - to be an adult).</p>
<p class="bas indent1"><span class="nm">(h)</span><span class="cl">Question:</span> An eight-month baby cannot live!</p>
<p class="bas indent2"><span class="nm">1.</span><span class="cl">(Beraisa):</span> An eight-month baby is like a rock. One may not move him on Shabbos, but his mother may bend down to let him nurse, because of danger (to both of them).</p>
<p class="bas bbbline">80b----------------------------------------80b</p>
<p class="bas indent1"><span class="nm">(i)</span><span class="cl">Answer:</span> The case is, there are Simanim that he is viable:</p>
<p class="bas indent2"><span class="nm">1.</span><span class="cl">(Beraisa) Question:</span> What is an eight-month baby?</p>
<p class="bas indent2"><span class="nm">2.</span><span class="cl">Answer #1:</span> It is one who was not in the womb the proper time;</p>
<p class="bas indent2"><span class="nm">3.</span><span class="cl">Answer #2 (Rebbi):</span> There are Simanim of this. His hair and nails are unfinished;</p>
<p class="bas indent3"><span class="nm">i.</span>If they are finished, we assume that he is a seven-month baby that delayed a month before being born.</p>
<p class="bas indent1"><span class="nm">(j)</span><span class="cl">Question:</span> A case occurred, and a woman gave birth 12 months after her husband went overseas. Rabah Tosfa'ah ruled that the child is Kosher;</p>
<p class="bas indent2"><span class="nm">1.</span>Is this like Rebbi, who says that a baby may delay in the womb (unlike Chachamim)?!</p>
<p class="bas indent1"><span class="nm">(k)</span><span class="cl">Answer:</span> R. Shimon ben Gamliel agrees, so they are like a majority.</p>
<p class="bas indent2"><span class="nm">1.</span><span class="cl">(Beraisa - R. Shimon ben Gamliel):</span> Any child that lives 30 days is viable. (Even if he was born in the eighth month, we say that he was a seven-month baby that came out late).</p>
<p class="bas indent1"><span class="nm">(l)</span><span class="cl">(Beraisa):</span> Any male who did not bring two hairs within 20 years is a Seris Chamah, even if he brings hairs later. The (other) Simanim are:</p>
<p class="bas indent2"><span class="nm">1.</span>He has no beard;</p>
<p class="bas indent2"><span class="nm">2.</span>His hair is soft;</p>
<p class="bas indent2"><span class="nm">3.</span>His skin is smooth;</p>
<p class="bas indent2"><span class="nm">4.</span>R. Shimon ben Gamliel says, his urine does not foam;</p>
<p class="bas indent2"><span class="nm">5.</span>Some say, when he urinates it does not make an arch;</p>
<p class="bas indent2"><span class="nm">6.</span>Some say, his semen is watery;</p>
<p class="bas indent2"><span class="nm">7.</span>Some say, his urine does not putrefy;</p>
<p class="bas indent2"><span class="nm">8.</span>Others say, when he bathes in winter his body does not give off steam;</p>
<p class="bas indent2"><span class="nm">9.</span>R. Shimon ben Elazar says, his voice is stricken, and one cannot discern his gender from it.</p>
<p class="bas indent1"><span class="nm">(m)</span>Any female who did not bring two hairs within 20 years is an Ailonis, even if she brings hairs later. The Simanim are:</p>
<p class="bas indent2"><span class="nm">1.</span>She has no breasts;</p>
<p class="bas indent2"><span class="nm">2.</span>Bi'ah is painful for her;</p>
<p class="bas indent2"><span class="nm">3.</span>R. Shimon ben Gamliel says, she does not have curved hips.</p>
<p class="bas indent2"><span class="nm">4.</span>R. Shimon ben Elazar says, her voice is deep, and one cannot discern her gender from it.</p>
<p class="bas indent1"><span class="nm">(n)</span><span class="cl">(Rav Huna):</span> One must have all the Simanim of a Seris to be a Seris.</p>
<p class="bas indent1"><span class="nm">(o)</span><span class="cl">(R. Yochanan):</span> One of them suffices.</p>
<p class="bas indent2"><span class="nm">1.</span>When he has two hairs in the beard, all agree that he is a Seris only if he has all the Simanim. They argue when he lacks two hairs in the beard.</p>
<p class="bas indent1"><span class="nm">(p)</span><span class="cl">Question:</span> Rabah bar Avuha said 'Check Rav Nachman. If he gives off steam when he bathes, I will marry my daughter to him.' Was this like Rav Huna?</p>
<p class="bas indent1"><span class="nm">(q)</span><span class="cl">Answer:</span> No, it is even like R. Yochanan. Rav Nachman had patches of hair in the beard.</p>
<p class="bas subject"><span class="nm">3)</span>THE <i>SEIFA</i> IS LIKE R. AKIVA</p>
<p class="bas indent1"><span class="nm">(a)</span><span class="cl">(Mishnah):</span> A Seris does not do Chalitzah or Yibum. Also, an Ailonis ...</p>
<p class="bas indent1"><span class="nm">(b)</span>The Mishnah discusses a Seris similar to an Ailonis. Just like an Ailonis is b'Yedei Shamayim, also the Seris.</p>
<p class="bas indent1"><span class="nm">(c)</span>This Seifa was taught anonymously. It is like R. Akiva, who says that a Seris Adam does Chalitzah, but a Seris b'Yedei Shamayim does not.</p>
