<p class="bas subject"><span class="nm">1)</span>IS LAND ACQUIRED THROUGH A CHAZAKAH ON ITS TREES?</p>
<p class="bas indent1"><span class="nm">(a)</span><span class="cl">(Rav Zvid):</span> If Reuven made a Chazakah in the trees, and Shimon made a Chazakah in the land, each acquired what he was Machazik in. (Rashbam - Levi sold his land to Reuven and Shimon; Tosfos - Reuven and Shimon each claim 'I bought this field'.)</p>
<p class="bas indent1"><span class="nm">(b)</span><span class="cl">Question (Rav Papa):</span> If so, Reuven does not own any land. Shimon can tell him to uproot his trees (when they dry up; Tosfos - perhaps, immediately) and leave!</p>
<p class="bas indent1"><span class="nm">(c)</span><span class="cl">(Rav Papa):</span> Rather, Reuven acquired the trees and half the land (Rashbam - perhaps this means, the land needed for them; Tosfos - only the area of the stumps), and Shimon acquired the rest of the land.</p>
<p class="bas indent1"><span class="nm">(d)</span>The following is obvious. If Levi sold his land but not his trees, he kept land (for the sake of the trees) for himself;</p>
<p class="bas indent2"><span class="nm">1.</span>Even R. Akiva says that one sells generously only when he retains a pit or water cistern for himself (he does not retain a path for himself unless he specifies), for these do not harm the surrounding land, and the buyer will not tell him to remove them;</p>
<p class="bas indent2"><span class="nm">2.</span>Trees harm the surrounding land. If he did not keep land for himself, the buyer would tell him to uproot them (when they dry up).</p>
<p class="bas bbbline">37b----------------------------------------37b</p>
<p class="bas indent1"><span class="nm">(e)</span>R. Akiva and Chachamim argue about one who sold trees (Rashbam - two; Tosfos - at least three) but kept the land;</p>
<p class="bas indent2"><span class="nm">1.</span>R. Akiva says that one sells generously, and he sold also land (for the sake of the trees);</p>
<p class="bas indent2"><span class="nm">2.</span>Chachamim say that one sells stingily, and he kept all the land for himself;</p>
<p class="bas indent2"><span class="nm">3.</span>Even Rav Zvid (who said that when Reuven made a Chazakah in the trees, and Shimon made a Chazakah in the land, each acquired what he was Machazik in) could say that R. Akiva admits there, but argues here;</p>
<p class="bas indent3"><span class="nm">i.</span>There, Shimon can say 'just like I got only land, you got only trees.' Here, Levi sells generously (at his own expense).</p>
<p class="bas indent2"><span class="nm">4.</span>Even Rav Papa (who said that Reuven acquired also land) could say that here, Chachamim argue and say that the buyer gets no land;</p>
<p class="bas indent3"><span class="nm">i.</span>There, the seller sold everything. We should not assume that he was generous to one and stingy to the other. Rather, he was generous to both;</p>
<p class="bas indent3"><span class="nm">ii.</span>Here, the seller kept land for himself. We assume that he was stingy and sold only the trees.</p>
<p class="bas subject"><span class="nm">2)</span>TREES SPACED MORE DENSELY THAN USUAL</p>
<p class="bas indent1"><span class="nm">(a)</span><span class="cl">(Chachamim of Neharde'a):</span> If one ate the Peros of 30 trees (end of 35b) that are spaced more densely than normal, this is not a Chazakah (for the extra trees are destined to be uprooted).</p>
<p class="bas indent1"><span class="nm">(b)</span><span class="cl">Objection (Rava):</span> If so, how is one Machazik in a patch used to grow fodder (which is seeded very densely? Here also, he will uproot some!)</p>
<p class="bas indent1"><span class="nm">(c)</span><span class="cl">(Rava):</span> If one sold trees spaced more densely than normal, the buyer does not receive land.</p>
<p class="bas indent1"><span class="nm">(d)</span><span class="cl">(R. Zeira):</span> Tana'im argue about this law.</p>
<p class="bas indent2"><span class="nm">1.</span><span class="cl">(Mishnah - R. Shimon):</span> If the rows of vines in a vineyard are less than four Amos apart, this is not considered  a vineyard;</p>
<p class="bas indent2"><span class="nm">2.</span>Chachamim say, it is a vineyard. We view the extra vines as if they were uprooted.</p>
