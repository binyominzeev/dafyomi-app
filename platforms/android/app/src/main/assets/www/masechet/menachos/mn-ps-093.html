<div class="indent1"><span class="nm">(a)</span><p><span class="cl">(Mishnah):</span> An heir is Somech.</p></div>
<div class="indent1"><span class="nm">(b)</span><p><span class="cl">(Rav Chananyah - Beraisa):</span> An heir does not Somech, and he cannot make Temurah.</p></div>
<div class="indent1"><span class="nm">(c)</span><p><span class="cl">Contradiction (Rava - Mishnah):</span> An heir is Somech, he brings the Nesachim, he can make Temurah.</p></div>
<div class="indent1"><span class="nm">(d)</span><p><span class="cl">Rav Chananyah:</span> Surely, my Beraisa is mistaken. I will correct it to conform to our Mishnah.</p></div>
<div class="indent1"><span class="nm">(e)</span><p><span class="cl">Rava:</span> You need not correct it. Your Beraisa is like R. Yehudah:</p></div>
<div class="indent2"><span class="nm">1.</span><p><span class="cl">(Beraisa):</span> An heir is Somech, he brings the Nesachim, and he can make Temurah;</p></div>
<div class="indent2"><span class="nm">2.</span><p>R. Yehudah says, he is not Somech, and he cannot make Temurah.</p></div>
<div class="indent1"><span class="nm">(f)</span><p><span class="cl">Question:</span> What is R. Yehudah's reason?</p></div>
<div class="indent1"><span class="nm">(g)</span><p><span class="cl">Answer:</span> Regarding Semichah, he expounds "Korbano", but not his father's Korban;</p></div>
<div class="indent2"><span class="nm">1.</span><p>He learns making Hekdesh (through Temurah) from Hakravas Hekdesh (Semichah). Just like an heir does not Somech, he cannot make Temurah.</p></div>
<div class="indent1"><span class="nm">(h)</span><p>Chachamim expound "Hamer Yamir" to include an heir (he can make Temurah);</p></div>
<div class="indent2"><span class="nm">1.</span><p>They learn Hakravah (Semichah) from making Hekdesh (Temurah). Just like an heir can make Temurah, he can Somech.</p></div>
<div class="indent1"><span class="nm">(i)</span><p><span class="cl">Question:</span> How do Chachamim expound "Korbano"?</p></div>
<div class="indent1"><span class="nm">(j)</span><p><span class="cl">Answer:</span> They use the three times it says 'Korbano' to teach that Reuven may not be Somech on Shimon's Korban, that Semichah does not apply to a Nochri's Korban, and that every partner on a Korban must be Somech.</p></div>
<div class="indent1"><span class="nm">(k)</span><p>R. Yehudah uses one of the three to exclude an heir. He does not expound that every partner must be Somech;</p></div>
<div class="indent2"><span class="nm">1.</span><p>Alternatively, he holds that one 'Korbano' excludes Semichah on another's Korban, be it a Yisrael or Nochri. One 'Korbano' excludes an heir. (Another verse is needed, for sometimes an heir is considered to be just like the deceased.) The third requires all partners to be Somech.</p></div>
<div class="indent1"><span class="nm">(l)</span><p><span class="cl">Question:</span> How does R. Yehudah expound "Hamer Yamir"?</p></div>
<div class="indent1"><span class="nm">(m)</span><p><span class="cl">Answer:</span> This includes a woman (she can make Temurah);</p></div>
<div class="indent2"><span class="nm">1.</span><p><span class="cl">(Beraisa) Question:</span> The entire Parshah of Temurah is written in the masculine. What is the source that it also applies to women?</p></div>
<div class="indent2"><span class="nm">2.</span><p><span class="cl">Answer:</span> "Hamer Yamir" includes women.</p></div>
<div class="indent1"><span class="nm">(n)</span><p>Chachamim use "v'Im" to include women. R. Yehudah does not expound "v'Im".</p></div>
<div class="subject"><span class="nm">2)</span><p>PEOPLE WHO ARE NOT SOMECH</p></div>
<div class="indent1"><span class="nm">(a)</span><p><span class="cl">(Mishnah):</span> All do Semichah, except for a child, lunatic or Cheresh (deaf-mute), a blind person, a Nochri, a slave, a Shali'ach or a woman.</p></div>
<div class="indent1"><span class="nm">(b)</span><p>Semichah is a remnant of the Mitzvah. (If it was not done, one was Yotzei.)</p></div>
<div class="indent1"><span class="nm">(c)</span><p>One leans on the head with both hands. We slaughter right where Semichah was done. Shechitah is done right after Semichah.</p></div>
<div class="indent1"><span class="nm">(d)</span><p><span class="cl">(Gemara) Question:</span> We understand why most of these may not Somech;</p></div>
<div class="indent2"><span class="nm">1.</span><p>A child, lunatic or Cheresh lacks understanding. Nochrim are excluded, for it says "Bnei Yisrael" (Tosfos - this also excludes a woman on her own Korban);</p></div>
<div class="indent2"><span class="nm">2.</span><p>However, why is a blind person excluded?</p></div>
<div class="indent1"><span class="nm">(e)</span><p><span class="cl">Answer #1 (Rav Chisda or R. Yitzchak bar Avodimi):</span> We learn from a Gezerah Shavah "Semichah-Semichah" from the Sanhedrin (who are Somech on Par He'elam Davar. Rashi  - a blind person (or any other Ba'al Mum) cannot be on the Sanhedrin. They must be unblemished, like Moshe. Tosfos asks that if so, any Ba'al Mum should be exempt from Semichah! Keren Orah - we exempt only a blind person, since Semichah must be "Lifnei Hash-m." He lacks proper awareness of being Lifnei Hash-m. Sefas Emes - the Gezerah Shavah exempts a blind person, for regarding the Sanhedrin it says "me'Einei ha'Edah", so they cannot be blind. We cannot exempt other blemishes, for our source to disqualify them for the Sanhedrin is a Hekesh to Moshe, so they cannot then teach through a Gezerah Shavah.)</p></div>
<div class="indent1"><span class="nm">(f)</span><p><span class="cl">Answer #2 (the other of Rav Chisda and R. Yitzchak bar Avodimi):</span> We learn from a Gezerah Shavah "Semichah-Semichah" from Olas Re'iyah (the Olah that one must bring each festival. A blind person is exempt, for we expound 'Yir'eh - Yera'eh': Re'iyah applies to one who can see and be seen in the Mikdash);</p></div>
<div class="indent1"><span class="nm">(g)</span><p><span class="cl">Question:</span> Why doesn't the second opinion learn from the Sanhedrin?</p></div>
<div class="bbbline">93b----------------------------------------93b</p></div>
<div class="indent1"><span class="nm">(h)</span><p><span class="cl">Answer:</span> We learn a Korban Yachid from a Korban Yachid, and not from a Korban Tzibur;</p></div>
<div class="indent1"><span class="nm">(i)</span><p><span class="cl">Question:</span> Why doesn't the first opinion learn from Olas Re'iyah?</p></div>
<div class="indent1"><span class="nm">(j)</span><p><span class="cl">Answer:</span> We learn from a place where it explicitly says "Semichah". Semichah is not said regarding Olas Re'iyah. It is learned from the Parshah of Olas Nedavah.</p></div>
<div class="indent2"><span class="nm">1.</span><p><span class="cl">(A reciter of Beraisos):</span> "Va'Yakrev Es ha'Olah (of the Milu'im) va'Ya'aseha ka'Mishpat" it is offered like Olas Nedavah;</p></div>
<div class="indent2"><span class="nm">2.</span><p>This teaches that Olas Chovah requires Semichah, like Olas Nedavah.</p></div>
<div class="indent1"><span class="nm">(k)</span><p><span class="cl">(Mishnah):</span> A slave, Shali'ach or woman (is not Somech).</p></div>
<div class="indent1"><span class="nm">(l)</span><p><span class="cl">(Beraisa):</span> (Semichah is done with) "Yado", but not with his slave's hand. He uses Yado", and not his Shali'ach's hand; He uses Yado", and not his wife's hand.</p></div>
<div class="indent1"><span class="nm">(m)</span><p><span class="cl">Question:</span> Why do we need all of these?</p></div>
<div class="indent1"><span class="nm">(n)</span><p><span class="cl">Answer:</span> Had the Torah said "Yado" only once, we would have said that it excludes a slave; for a slave is not obligated in (all) the Mitzvos, but a Shali'ach can be Somech, for he is (i.e. his actions are) considered like (those of) the Meshale'ach (the one who sent him);</p></div>
<div class="indent2"><span class="nm">1.</span><p>Had it said "Yado" only twice, we would exclude only a slave and Shali'ach; for they are not considered like the owner himself, but his wife can Somech on his Korban, for she is considered like her husband.</p></div>
<div class="indent1"><span class="nm">(o)</span><p><span class="cl">(Mishnah):</span> Semichah is a remnant of the Mitzvah.</p></div>
<div class="indent1"><span class="nm">(p)</span><p><span class="cl">(Beraisa) Question:</span> Why does it say "v'Samach... v'Nirtzah"? Atonement does not come through Semichah, rather, through (Zerikah of) Dam - "Ki ha'Dam Hu ba'Nefesh Yechaper"!</p></div>
<div class="indent1"><span class="nm">(q)</span><p><span class="cl">Answer:</span> This teaches that if one treated it like a remnant of a Mitzvah (i.e. omitted it), the Torah considers it as if he did not atone (l'Chatchilah) but did atone (b'Di'eved).</p></div>
<div class="indent1"><span class="nm">(r)</span><p>We learn similarly regarding Tenufah:</p></div>
<div class="indent2"><span class="nm">1.</span><p><span class="cl">(Beraisa) Question:</span> Why does it say "li'Snufah Lechaper"? Atonement does not come through Tenufah, rather, through Dam - "Ki ha'Dam..."!</p></div>
<div class="indent2"><span class="nm">2.</span><p><span class="cl">Answer:</span> This teaches that if one treated it like a remnant of a Mitzvah, the Torah considers it as if he did not atone, but did atone.</p></div>
<div class="subject"><span class="nm">3)</span><p>HOW SEMICHAH IS DONE</p></div>
<div class="indent1"><span class="nm">(a)</span><p><span class="cl">(Mishnah):</span> On the head.</p></div>
<div class="indent1"><span class="nm">(b)</span><p><span class="cl">(Beraisa):</span> He is Somech "Yado Al Rosh", and not on the (throat side of the) neck. He is Somech "Yado Al Rosh", and not on the back. He is Somech "Yado Al Rosh", and not on the chest.</p></div>
<div class="indent1"><span class="nm">(c)</span><p><span class="cl">Question:</span> Why do we need all of these?</p></div>
<div class="indent1"><span class="nm">(d)</span><p><span class="cl">Answer:</span> If the Torah taught only one exclusion, we would have excluded only the neck, for it is not even with the head; but we would not exclude the back;</p></div>
<div class="indent2"><span class="nm">1.</span><p>Had it taught only about two exclusions, we would exclude the neck and back, but not the chest, for Tenufah is done with it.</p></div>
<div class="indent2"><span class="nm">2.</span><p>Therefore, all three exclusions are needed.</p></div>
<div class="indent1"><span class="nm">(e)</span><p><span class="cl">Question:</span> May one be Somech his hands on the sides (of the head, i.e. the jaws)?</p></div>
<div class="indent1"><span class="nm">(f)</span><p><span class="cl">Answer (Beraisa - Aba Bira'ah):</span> He is Somech "Yado Al Rosh", and not on the sides.</p></div>
<div class="indent1"><span class="nm">(g)</span><p><span class="cl">Question (R. Yirmeyah):</span> Is a cloth (Rashi Kesav Yad - wrapped around one's hands) a Chatzitzah?</p></div>
<div class="indent1"><span class="nm">(h)</span><p>Answer (Beraisa):...As long as nothing separates between his hands and the Korban. (I.e. a cloth is a Chatzitzah.)</p></div>
<div class="indent1"><span class="nm">(i)</span><p><span class="cl">(Mishnah):</span> He is Somech with both hands.</p></div>
<div class="indent1"><span class="nm">(j)</span><p><span class="cl">Question:</span> What is the source of this?</p></div>
<div class="indent1"><span class="nm">(k)</span><p><span class="cl">Answer (Reish Lakish):</span> "V'Samach Aharon Es Shtei Yadav" is written missing a 'Yud', like 'Yado',  yet it explicitly says that he uses both hands!</p></div>
<div class="indent2"><span class="nm">1.</span><p>This is a Binyan Av. It teaches that wherever it says "Yado", it refers to both hands unless specified otherwise.</p></div>
<div class="indent1"><span class="nm">(l)</span><p>R. Elazar taught this in the Beis Medrash. (Sefas Emes - he also thought of this answer.) He did not say it in the name of Reish Lakish. Reish Lakish was upset.</p></div>
<div class="indent1"><span class="nm">(m)</span><p><span class="cl">Question (Reish Lakish):</span> If you say that "Yado" always refers to both hands, why does it sometimes say "Yadav", e.g. "Yadav Tevi'enah", "Yadav Rav Lo", "Sikel Es Yadav"...?</p></div>
<div class="indent2"><span class="nm">1.</span><p>He asked 24 such questions. R. Elazar could not answer. When Reish Lakish ceased to be upset, he himself answered.</p></div>
<div class="indent1"><span class="nm">(n)</span><p><span class="cl">Answer (Reish Lakish):</span> "Yado" written regarding Semichah refers to both hands.</p></div>
<div class="indent1"><span class="nm">(o)</span><p><span class="cl">Question:</span> Why must it say "va'Yismoch Yadav Alav"? It refers to Semichah! (It would have sufficed to say 'Yado'!)</p></div>
<div class="indent1"><span class="nm">(p)</span><p><span class="cl">Answer:</span> "Yado" written regarding Semichah on animals refers to both hands.</p></div>
<div class="indent1"><span class="nm">(q)</span><p><span class="cl">(Mishnah):</span> We slaughter right where Semichah was done. Shechitah is done right after Semichah.</p></div>
<div class="indent1"><span class="nm">(r)</span><p><span class="cl">Question:</span> What does this mean? (Rashi Kesav Yad - since Shechitah is right after Semichah, obviously Shechitah is right where Semichah was done! Rashi - the Mishnah connotes that Shechitah is done at the same place on the animal as Semichah. Obviously, this is wrong!)</p></div>
<div class="indent1"><span class="nm">(s)</span><p><span class="cl">Answer:</span> It means that Shechitah is done at the same place in the Azarah as Semichah because Shechitah is right after Semichah.</p></div>
