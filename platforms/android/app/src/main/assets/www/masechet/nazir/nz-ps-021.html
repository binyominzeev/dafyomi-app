<p class="bas indent1"><span class="nm">(a)</span><span class="cl">Support (for Reish Lakish - Beraisa):</span> If Reuven said 'I am a Nazir', Shimon paused Kedei Dibur, and said 'and I', Reuven is a Nazir, but Shimon is not.</p>
<p class="bas indent2"><span class="nm">1.</span>Kedei Dibur is the time for a Talmid to greet his Rebbi.</p>
<p class="bas indent1"><span class="nm">(b)</span><span class="cl">Suggestion:</span> The Mishnah also supports Reish Lakish.</p>
<p class="bas indent2"><span class="nm">1.</span><span class="cl">(Mishnah):</span> If Reuven said 'I am a Nazir'; another said 'and I'; and another said 'and I' (they are all Nezirim).</p>
<p class="bas indent2"><span class="nm">2.</span>The Mishnah did not teach about more people, because it is after Kedei Dibur (four words were said after Reuven finished)!</p>
<p class="bas indent1"><span class="nm">(c)</span><span class="cl">Rejection:</span> This is no support. The Tana is not a peddler (who announces everything he has. The Tana did not elaborate to teach every case!)</p>
<p class="bas indent1"><span class="nm">(d)</span><span class="cl">Question:</span> If so, the Tana should have taught about only one other who said 'and I'!</p>
<p class="bas indent1"><span class="nm">(e)</span><span class="cl">Answer:</span> Indeed, he should have taught only one;</p>
<p class="bas indent2"><span class="nm">1.</span>However, the Seifa teaches 'if the first annulled his Nezirus, the Nezirus of all of them is annulled. If the last annulled his Nezirus, all except for him are Nezirim.' This implies that there is someone in the middle;</p>
<p class="bas indent2"><span class="nm">2.</span>Therefore, the Reisha teaches that two people said 'and I.'</p>
<p class="bas indent1"><span class="nm">(f)</span><span class="cl">Question:</span> Is everyone (after the second) Matfis in the first Nazir (accept to be Nezirim like him), or in the last one (who spoke)?</p>
<p class="bas indent2"><span class="nm">1.</span><span class="cl">Question:</span> What difference does this make?</p>
<p class="bas indent2"><span class="nm">2.</span><span class="cl">Answer:</span> It determines whether or not more people can be Matfis:</p>
<p class="bas indent3"><span class="nm">i.</span>If each is Matfis in the last one, there is no limit to how many can be Matfis;</p>
<p class="bas indent3"><span class="nm">ii.</span>If each is Matfis in Reuven, all must begin Toch Kedei Dibur of Reuven's words.</p>
<p class="bas indent1"><span class="nm">(g)</span><span class="cl">Answer #1 (Mishnah):</span> If Reuven said 'I am a Nazir'; another said 'and I'; and another said 'and I.'</p>
<p class="bas indent2"><span class="nm">1.</span><span class="cl">Inference:</span> No others can be Matfis.</p>
<p class="bas indent2"><span class="nm">2.</span>We must say that each is Matfis in Reuven. If each is Matfis in the previous, the Tana should have listed more!</p>
<p class="bas indent1"><span class="nm">(h)</span><span class="cl">Rejection:</span> The Tana is not a peddler!</p>
<p class="bas indent1"><span class="nm">(i)</span><span class="cl">Question:</span> If so, the Tana should have taught about only one who said 'and I'!</p>
<p class="bas indent1"><span class="nm">(j)</span><span class="cl">Answer:</span> The Seifa teaches 'if the first annulled ... if the last annulled ... This implies that there is someone in the middle. Therefore, the Reisha teaches about two.'</p>
<p class="bas indent1"><span class="nm">(k)</span><span class="cl">Answer #2 (to Question (f) - Mishnah):</span> If the first annulled his Nezirus, the Nezirus of all of them is annulled.</p>
<p class="bas indent2"><span class="nm">1.</span><span class="cl">Inference:</span> If the middle one annulled his Nezirus, the Nezirus of the others is not annulled.</p>
<p class="bas indent2"><span class="nm">2.</span>This shows that each is Matfis in Reuven.</p>
<p class="bas indent1"><span class="nm">(l)</span><span class="cl">Rejection:</span> Perhaps each is Matfis in the last one;</p>
<p class="bas indent2"><span class="nm">1.</span>The Tana wanted to teach that the Nezirus of all the others is annulled, therefore he had to teach that the first annulled his Nezirus.</p>
<p class="bas indent2"><span class="nm">2.</span>If the second annulled his Nezirus, this would not annul the Nezirus of the first.</p>
<p class="bas indent1"><span class="nm">(m)</span><span class="cl">Answer #3 (Mishnah):</span> If the last one annulled his Nezirus, he is not a Nazir, the rest of them are Nezirim.</p>
<p class="bas indent2"><span class="nm">1.</span><span class="cl">Inference:</span> This applies only to the last. If the middle one annulled his Nezirus, this would annul the Nezirus of the one after him!</p>
<p class="bas indent2"><span class="nm">2.</span>This shows that each is Matfis in the last one.</p>
<p class="bas indent1"><span class="nm">(n)</span><span class="cl">Rejection:</span> Perhaps each is Matfis in Reuven;</p>
<p class="bas indent2"><span class="nm">1.</span>The Mishnah says 'last', but it means the middle!</p>
<p class="bas indent2"><span class="nm">2.</span>Since the Reisha discussed the first, the Seifa says 'last'.</p>
<p class="bas indent1"><span class="nm">(o)</span><span class="cl">Answer #4 (Beraisa):</span> If the first annulled his Nezirus, the Nezirus of all of them is annulled. If the last annulled his Nezirus, all except for him are Nezirim. If the middle annulled his Nezirus, those after him are not Nezirim, but those before him are Nezirim.</p>
<p class="bas indent2"><span class="nm">1.</span>This shows that each is Matfis in the last one.</p>
<p class="bas subject"><span class="nm">2)</span><i>NEZIRUS</i> OF PART OF THE BODY</p>
<p class="bas indent1"><span class="nm">(a)</span><span class="cl">(Mishnah):</span> If Reuven said 'I am a Nazir', and Shimon said 'my mouth is like his mouth', or 'my hair is like his hair', Shimon is also a Nazir.</p>
<p class="bas indent1"><span class="nm">(b)</span><span class="cl">Contradiction (Beraisa):</span> If one said 'my hand is a Nezirah'; or, 'my foot is a Nezirah', these words do nothing;</p>
<p class="bas bbbline">21b----------------------------------------21b</p>
<p class="bas indent2"><span class="nm">1.</span>If he said 'my head is a Nezirah' or 'my liver is a Nezirah', he is a Nazir;</p>
<p class="bas indent2"><span class="nm">2.</span>The rule is, if he accepted Nezirus on a part of the body that is vital to life, he is a Nazir.</p>
<p class="bas indent1"><span class="nm">(c)</span><span class="cl">Answer (Rav Yehudah):</span> He means 'my mouth is like his mouth regarding wine' or 'my hair is like his hair regarding cutting.'</p>
<p class="bas subject"><span class="nm">3)</span>HOW DOES <i>HAFARAH</i> WORK?</p>
<p class="bas indent1"><span class="nm">(a)</span><span class="cl">(Mishnah):</span> If Leah said 'I am a Nezirah', and her husband said 'and I', he cannot annul her Nezirus.</p>
<p class="bas indent1"><span class="nm">(b)</span><span class="cl">Question:</span> When a husband annuls his wife's vow, does he uproot it retroactively, or cut it off from now on?</p>
<p class="bas indent2"><span class="nm">1.</span><span class="cl">Question:</span> What difference does this make?</p>
<p class="bas indent2"><span class="nm">2.</span><span class="cl">Answer:</span> If Leah said 'I am a Nezirah', Rachel heard and said 'and I', and Leah's husband annulled Leah's Nezirus:</p>
<p class="bas indent3"><span class="nm">i.</span>If the vow is uprooted, Rachel's Nezirus is also uprooted.</p>
<p class="bas indent3"><span class="nm">ii.</span>If the vow is cut off from now on, Leah is no longer a Nezirah, but Rachel still is.</p>
<p class="bas indent1"><span class="nm">(c)</span><span class="cl">Answer #1 (Mishnah):</span> If Leah said 'I am a Nezirah', and her husband said 'and I', he cannot annul her Nezirus.</p>
<p class="bas indent2"><span class="nm">1.</span>If a husband cuts off a vow from now on, he should be able to annul her vow, and he will remain a Nazir!</p>
<p class="bas indent2"><span class="nm">2.</span><span class="cl">Conclusion:</span> We must say that he uproots it. (He cannot annul her Nezirus, for this would annul his own Nezirus, and he cannot do this.)</p>
<p class="bas indent1"><span class="nm">(d)</span><span class="cl">Rejection:</span> Really, he cuts off a vow.</p>
<p class="bas indent2"><span class="nm">1.</span>The reason he cannot annul her Nezirus is not because this would permit his own. Rather, saying 'and I' is like Kiyum (he shows that he wants her Nezirus to stand).</p>
<p class="bas indent2"><span class="nm">2.</span>If he annuls his Kiyum, he may then annul her Nezirus. If not, he may not.</p>
<p class="bas indent1"><span class="nm">(e)</span><span class="cl">Answer #2 (Mishnah):</span> If Leah accepted Nezirus, and designated an animal for Korbanos Nazir, and later her husband annulled her Nezirus:</p>
<p class="bas indent2"><span class="nm">1.</span>If it was his animal, it may graze with the flock (i.e. it has no Kedushah);</p>
<p class="bas indent2"><span class="nm">2.</span>If it was her animal, if it was the Chatas, it must die.</p>
<p class="bas indent2"><span class="nm">3.</span><span class="cl">Inference:</span> If a husband uproots a vow retroactively, even if it was her animal, it should have no Kedushah!</p>
<p class="bas indent2"><span class="nm">4.</span><span class="cl">Conclusion:</span> We must say that a husband cuts off a vow.</p>
<p class="bas indent1"><span class="nm">(f)</span><span class="cl">Rejection:</span> Really, he uproots it;</p>
<p class="bas indent2"><span class="nm">1.</span>Since she (does not - Tosfos (22a DH Ha) deletes this from the text) needs atonement, it is like a Chatas that was not offered before its owner died.</p>
<p class="bas indent2"><span class="nm">2.</span>We have a tradition from Sinai that such a Chatas must die.</p>
<p class="bas indent1"><span class="nm">(g)</span><span class="cl">Answer #3 (Mishnah):</span> If Leah accepted Nezirus, and drank wine or became Teme'ah, she receives 40 lashes.</p>
<p class="bas indent2"><span class="nm">1.</span><span class="cl">Question:</span> What is the case?</p>
<p class="bas indent3"><span class="nm">i.</span>If her husband did not annul her Nezirus, this is obvious!</p>
<p class="bas indent2"><span class="nm">2.</span><span class="cl">Answer:</span> We must say that he annulled her vow.</p>
<p class="bas indent2"><span class="nm">3.</span><span class="cl">Question:</span> If Hafarah uproots, why is she lashed?!</p>
<p class="bas indent2"><span class="nm">4.</span><span class="cl">Conclusion:</span> We must say that Hafarah cuts off the vow.</p>
<p class="bas indent1"><span class="nm">(h)</span><span class="cl">Rejection:</span> Really, Hafarah uproots;</p>
<p class="bas indent2"><span class="nm">1.</span>Indeed, the Reisha is obvious (he did not annul her vow). It was taught due to the Seifa.</p>
<p class="bas indent2"><span class="nm">2.</span><span class="cl">(Seifa):</span> If her husband annulled her vow, and she did not know, and she later drank wine or became Teme'ah, she does not receive 40 lashes.</p>
