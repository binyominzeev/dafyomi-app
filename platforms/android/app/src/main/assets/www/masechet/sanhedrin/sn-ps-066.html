<p class="bas subject"><span class="nm">1)</span>NICHUSH</p>
<p class="bas indent1"><span class="nm">(a)</span><span class="cl">(Beraisa):</span> "Lo Tenacheshu v'Lo Te'onenu" refers to people who look for or act according to omens of weasels, birds and fish.</p>
<p class="bas subject"><span class="nm">2)</span>WHEN IS ONE CHAYAV SEKILAH FOR SHABBOS?</p>
<p class="bas indent1"><span class="nm">(a)</span><span class="cl">(Mishnah):</span> If one desecrates Shabbos by something that is Chayav Kares (for Mezid) and Chayav Korban b'Shogeg (if he was Mezid and warned, he is Chayav Misah).</p>
<p class="bas indent1"><span class="nm">(b)</span><span class="cl">(Gemara) Question:</span> This implies that there is a desecration of Shabbos that is not Chayav Korban or Kares. What is it?</p>
<p class="bas indent1"><span class="nm">(c)</span><span class="cl">Answer #1:</span> According to R. Akiva, the Torah forbids to leave the Techum (2000 Amos around the city) on Shabbos. This is not Chayav Korban or Kares;</p>
<p class="bas indent1"><span class="nm">(d)</span><span class="cl">Answer #2:</span> According to R. Yosi, burning on Shabbos is only a Lav.</p>
<p class="bas subject"><span class="nm">3)</span>CURSING A PARENT</p>
<p class="bas indent1"><span class="nm">(a)</span><span class="cl">(Mishnah):</span> One is liable for cursing his father and mother only if he curses with Hash-m's name;</p>
<p class="bas indent1"><span class="nm">(b)</span>R. Meir says, if he cursed with a Kinuy he is liable;</p>
<p class="bas indent1"><span class="nm">(c)</span>Chachamim say, he is exempt.</p>
<p class="bas indent1"><span class="nm">(d)</span><span class="cl">(Gemara) Question:</span> Who are the Chachamim who exempt?</p>
<p class="bas indent1"><span class="nm">(e)</span><span class="cl">Answer:</span> It is R. Menachem b'Rebbi Yosi.</p>
<p class="bas indent2"><span class="nm">1.</span><span class="cl">(Beraisa - R. Menachem b'Rebbi Yosi) Question:</span> What do we learn from "b'Nokvo <i>Shem</i> Yumas"?</p>
<p class="bas indent2"><span class="nm">2.</span><span class="cl">Answer:</span> One is liable for cursing a parent only if he used Hash-m's name.</p>
<p class="bas indent1"><span class="nm">(f)</span><span class="cl">(Beraisa):</span> "Ish Ish" includes a daughter, Tumtum (one of unknown gender, his genitals are covered) and Androginus (one who has male and female genitals);</p>
<p class="bas indent2"><span class="nm">1.</span><span class="cl">Question (R. Yoshiyah):</span> "Asher Yekalel Es Aviv v'Es Imo" teaches only if he curses both. What is the source if he curses only one of them?</p>
<p class="bas indent2"><span class="nm">2.</span><span class="cl">Answer (R. Yoshiyah):</span> "Aviv v'Imo Kilel" - cursing is written next to the mother (as well as next to the father) to teach that he is liable even if he curses only one of them.</p>
<p class="bas indent2"><span class="nm">3.</span>R. Yonason says, the 'Vov' in "Aviv <i>v</i>'Es Imo" connotes even one, unless the Torah explicitly says 'together' (like it does regarding Kilayim).</p>
<p class="bas indent1"><span class="nm">(g)</span>"Mos Yumas" - by stoning.</p>
<p class="bas indent1"><span class="nm">(h)</span><span class="cl">Suggestion:</span> Perhaps it is a different Misas Beis Din!</p>
<p class="bas indent1"><span class="nm">(i)</span><span class="cl">Rejection:</span> It says here "Damav Bo." It says regarding Ov and Yid'oni "Demeihem Bam." There (it explicitly says that) it means stoning, and the same applies here.</p>
<p class="bas indent1"><span class="nm">(j)</span><span class="cl">Question:</span> This teaches the punishment. What Lav forbids this?</p>
<p class="bas indent1"><span class="nm">(k)</span><span class="cl">Answer:</span> If his father was a judge, he transgresses "Elokim Lo Sekalel";</p>
<p class="bas indent2"><span class="nm">1.</span>If his father was a Nasi (king), he transgresses "v'Nasi v'Amcha Lo Sa'or."</p>
<p class="bas indent1"><span class="nm">(l)</span><span class="cl">Question:</span> If his father was neither a judge nor a Nasi, what is the source?</p>
<p class="bas indent1"><span class="nm">(m)</span><span class="cl">Answer #1:</span> We learn from a Binyan Av (precedent) from both of them:</p>
<p class="bas indent2"><span class="nm">1.</span>Each has its own stringency. We are commanded to follow rulings of a judge, but not of a Nasi;</p>
<p class="bas indent2"><span class="nm">2.</span>We are commanded not to rebel against a Nasi, but not against a judge.</p>
<p class="bas indent2"><span class="nm">3.</span>The Tzad ha'Shavah of (what is common to) them is that they act like someone of your nation, and we are commanded not to curse them. Likewise, one may not curse his father!</p>
<p class="bas indent1"><span class="nm">(n)</span><span class="cl">Objection:</span> One may not curse a judge or a Nasi due to their greatness. This does not apply to one's father!</p>
<p class="bas indent1"><span class="nm">(o)</span><span class="cl">Answer #2:</span> "Lo Sekalel Cheresh" - just like one may not curse a deaf-mute, also one's father.</p>
<p class="bas indent2"><span class="nm">1.</span><span class="cl">Question:</span> One may not curse him because he is deaf. This does not apply to one's father!</p>
<p class="bas indent2"><span class="nm">2.</span><span class="cl">Answer:</span> We learn from a Nasi and a judge that deafness is not the criteria.</p>
<p class="bas indent2"><span class="nm">3.</span><span class="cl">Question:</span> We cannot learn from a judge or a Nasi. Their greatness causes the Isur to curse them!</p>
<p class="bas indent2"><span class="nm">4.</span><span class="cl">Answer:</span> Each has its own stringency. We learn from the Tzad ha'Shavah of them. They act like one of your nation, and we are commanded not to curse them. The same applies to one's father.</p>
<p class="bas indent2"><span class="nm">5.</span><span class="cl">Objection:</span> We cannot learn from these, for each of them is special!</p>
<p class="bas indent1"><span class="nm">(p)</span><span class="cl">Answer #3:</span> The Torah could have omitted Nasi or a judge (it could be learned from the other two), so we use it to teach about one's father.</p>
<p class="bas indent2"><span class="nm">1.</span><span class="cl">Question:</span> This is like the opinion that "Elokim Lo Sekalel" refers to a judge;</p>
<p class="bas indent3"><span class="nm">i.</span>According to the opinion that it refers to Hash-m (and forbids blasphemy), how can we answer?</p>
<p class="bas indent3"><span class="nm">ii.</span><span class="cl">(Beraisa - R. Yishmael):</span> "Elokim Lo Sekalel" refers to a judge;</p>
<p class="bas indent3"><span class="nm">iii.</span>R. Akiva says, it refers to Hash-m.</p>
<p class="bas indent3"><span class="nm">iv.</span><span class="cl">(Beraisa - R. Eliezer ben Yakov):</span> "Elokim Lo Sekalel" forbids blasphemy.</p>
<p class="bas indent2"><span class="nm">2.</span><span class="cl">Answer:</span> We must say that R. Yishmael learns the Isur of blasphemy from cursing a judge (there is no other source);</p>
<p class="bas indent3"><span class="nm">i.</span>Likewise, R. Akiva learns the Isur of cursing a judge from blasphemy!</p>
<p class="bas indent2"><span class="nm">3.</span><span class="cl">Question:</span> We understand R. Yishmael (the Torah calls a judge 'Elokim' to teach that it applies also to Hash-m). However, according to R. Akiva, perhaps there is no Isur to curse a judge!</p>
<p class="bas indent2"><span class="nm">4.</span><span class="cl">Answer:</span> If so, it should say 'Elokim Lo Sekal';</p>
<p class="bas indent3"><span class="nm">i.</span>Rather, it says "Sekalel" to teach that it also forbids cursing a judge.</p>

<p class="bas subject"><span class="nm">4)</span>STONING FOR BI'AH WITH A <i>NA'ARAH ME'ORASAH</i></p>
<p class="bas indent1"><span class="nm">(a)</span><span class="cl">(Mishnah):</span> One is not stoned for Bi'ah with a Na'arah Me'orasah, Ad (unless) she is a Na'arah (less than six months after becoming Bas Mitzvah), a virgin, Arusah, and in her father's house.</p>
<p class="bas indent1"><span class="nm">(b)</span>If two men had Bi'ah with her, the first is stoned, and the second is choked.</p>
<p class="bas indent1"><span class="nm">(c)</span><span class="cl">(Gemara - Beraisa):</span> "Na'arah" excludes a Bogeres (more than six months after becoming Bas Mitzvah). "Besulah" excludes a non-virgin. "Me'orasah" excludes a Nesu'ah. "Beis Aviha" excludes one whose father's messengers handed her over to her husband's (to take her for Chupah).</p>
<p class="bas indent1"><span class="nm">(d)</span><span class="cl">(Rav Yehudah):</span> Our Mishnah is like R. Meir, but Chachamim say that "Na'arah" includes a minor. (She must be at least three years old, for only then Bi'ah with her is considered Bi'ah.)</p>
<p class="bas indent1"><span class="nm">(e)</span><span class="cl">Question (Rav Acha mi'Difti):</span> Perhaps the Mishnah is like Chachamim. 'Unless she is a Na'arah' excludes a Bogeres!</p>
<p class="bas indent1"><span class="nm">(f)</span><span class="cl">Answer (Ravina):</span> If so, it should say 'one is liable <i>only</i> for a Na'arah, a virgin, Arusah, and in her father's house;</p>
<p class="bas indent2"><span class="nm">1.</span>Rather, it says '<i>Ad (until)</i> she is a Na'arah...', to exclude a minor.</p>
<p class="bas indent2"><span class="nm">2.</span>This cannot be refuted,</p>
<p class="bas indent1"><span class="nm">(g)</span><span class="cl">Question (R. Yakov bar Ada):</span> According to R. Meir, if one had Bi'ah with am Arusah minor, what is the law?</p>
<p class="bas indent2"><span class="nm">1.</span>Does the Parashah totally exclude (Bi'ah with) a minor (he is exempt), or does it apply to a minor, except for stoning?</p>
<p class="bas indent1"><span class="nm">(h)</span><span class="cl">Answer (Rav):</span> Presumably, it applies, except for stoning (he is choked).</p>
<p class="bas indent1"><span class="nm">(i)</span><span class="cl">Question:</span> "U'Mesu Gam Shneihem" teaches that they must be alike (i.e. both are adults and are Chayav Misah. If not, neither is killed!)</p>
<p class="bas indent1"><span class="nm">(j)</span>Rav was silent.</p>
<p class="bas indent1"><span class="nm">(k)</span><span class="cl">Question (Shmuel):</span> Rav should have answered "u'Mes ha'Ish Asher Shochav Imah Levado"!</p>
<p class="bas indent1"><span class="nm">(l)</span><span class="cl">Answer:</span> Tana'im argue like Rav and Shmuel do.</p>
<p class="bas indent2"><span class="nm">1.</span><span class="cl">(Beraisa - R. Yoshiyah):</span> "U'Mesu Gam Shneihem" - only if they are alike;</p>
<p class="bas indent2"><span class="nm">2.</span>R. Yonason says, "u'Mes ha'Ish... Levado" (if she is a minor).</p>
<p class="bas indent1"><span class="nm">(m)</span><span class="cl">Question:</span> What does R. Yonason learn from "u'Mesu Gam Shneihem"?</p>
<p class="bas indent1"><span class="nm">(n)</span><span class="cl">Answer (Rava):</span> This excludes acts of Chidudim (he touches the Ever to other parts of her body. She does not get much pleasure from this, surely she is exempt.) The verse teaches that (also) he is exempt.</p>
<p class="bas indent2"><span class="nm">1.</span>R. Yoshiyah does not need a verse to teach this. Obviously, one is not liable for it.</p>
<p class="bas indent1"><span class="nm">(o)</span><span class="cl">Question:</span> What does R. Yoshiyah learn from "u'Mes ha'Ish... Levado"?</p>
<p class="bas indent1"><span class="nm">(p)</span><span class="cl">Answer:</span> He learns Rebbi's law.</p>
<p class="bas indent2"><span class="nm">1.</span><span class="cl">(Beraisa):</span> If 10 men had Bi'ah with a Na'arah Me'orasah, and she is still a virgin (e.g. they had abnormal Bi'ah), all are stoned;</p>
<p class="bas indent2"><span class="nm">2.</span>Rebbi says, the first is stoned, and the others are choked.</p>

<p class="bas indent1"><span class="nm">(b)</span><span class="cl">Question:</span> What does Rebbi teach?</p>
<p class="bas indent1"><span class="nm">(c)</span><span class="cl">Answer #1 (Rav Huna brei d'Rav Yehoshua):</span> Rebbi holds like R. Yishmael, who says that an Arusah is burned, but a Nesu'ah is not;</p>
<p class="bas indent2"><span class="nm">1.</span>"...Ki Sechel Liznos" teaches that if her first Bi'ah was adultery, she is burned. If she had Bi'ah before this, she is choked.</p>
<p class="bas indent2"><span class="nm">2.</span><span class="cl">Question:</span> How is this similar to "u'Mes..."?</p>
<p class="bas indent2"><span class="nm">3.</span><span class="cl">Answer:</span> Just like an Arusah is stoned only if (she was a virgin, and) her first Bi'ah was adultery, also a Bas Kohen is burned only if her first Bi'ah was adultery.</p>
<p class="bas indent1"><span class="nm">(d)</span><span class="cl">Answer #2 (Rav Bivi bar Abayem citing Rav Yosef):</span> Rebbi holds like R. Meir, who says that (also a Nesu'ah is burned, but) if she married a Pasul (someone forbidden to marry a Bas Yisrael), she is choked for adultery.</p>
<p class="bas indent2"><span class="nm">1.</span>"...Ki <i>Sechel</i> Liznos" teaches that if her first Chilul (profane ate) was adultery, she is burned. If not, she is choked.</p>
<p class="bas indent1"><span class="nm">(e)</span><span class="cl">Question:</span> How is this similar to "u'Mes..."?</p>
<p class="bas indent1"><span class="nm">(f)</span><span class="cl">Answer:</span> That verse gives a special law (stoning) for first Bi'ah (of a Na'arah Me'orasah). Similarly, our verse gives a special law (burning) for her first Chilul.</p>
