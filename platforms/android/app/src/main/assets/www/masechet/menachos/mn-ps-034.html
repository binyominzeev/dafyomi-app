<div class="subject"><span class="nm">1)</span><p>WHICH DOORWAYS REQUIRE A MEZUZAH</p></div>
<div class="indent1"><span class="nm">(a)</span><p>Abaye and Rava conducted according to Rabah and Rav Yosef. Rav Ashi acted like the opinion of Rav and Shmuel, and was stringent (to put Mezuzos on both openings, like R. Yosi).</p></div>
<div class="indent2"><span class="nm">1.</span><p>The Halachah follows Rav and Shmuel, (and) we are stringent.</p></div>
<div class="indent1"><span class="nm">(b)</span><p><span class="cl">(Rav Huna):</span> If there is an opening in the ceiling to the attic, if there is only one doorway (at the top or bottom of the staircase leading to it), it requires a Mezuzah. If there are two, both require Mezuzos.</p></div>
<div class="indent1"><span class="nm">(c)</span><p><span class="cl">Inference (Rav Papa):</span> This teaches that if a room is open to porches on all four sides, all require Mezuzos.</p></div>
<div class="indent1"><span class="nm">(d)</span><p><span class="cl">Objection:</span> This is obvious!</p></div>
<div class="indent1"><span class="nm">(e)</span><p><span class="cl">Answer:</span> The Chidush is, even though he normally uses one of them more than the others (since when he made them, all were needed).</p></div>
<div class="indent1"><span class="nm">(f)</span><p><span class="cl">(Ameimar):</span> A corner opening (neither of the walls reaches to the corner, like this __ Ð) requires a Mezuzah.</p></div>
<div class="indent1"><span class="nm">(g)</span><p><span class="cl">Question (Rav Ashi):</span> it has no doorposts!</p></div>
<div class="indent1"><span class="nm">(h)</span><p><span class="cl">Answer (Ameimar):</span> The ends of the walls are its doorposts (even though the gap between them is not in line with either wall, rather, on a diagonal).</p></div>
<div class="indent1"><span class="nm">(i)</span><p>Rav Mari visited Shmuel. He saw a Mezuzah on an opening with only a left doorpost.</p></div>
<div class="indent2"><span class="nm">1.</span><p><span class="cl">Rav Mari:</span> Do you hold like R. Meir (who requires a Mezuzah when there is only one doorpost? He says this only when it is on the right, but not when it is on the left!</p></div>
<div class="indent3"><span class="nm">i.</span><p><span class="cl">(Beraisa) Suggestion:</span> Perhaps one should put the Mezuzah on the left side!</p></div>
<div class="indent3"><span class="nm">ii.</span><p><span class="cl">Rejection:</span> We read "Beisecha" as if it says 'Bi'asecha'. It must be on your right side when you enter.</p></div>
<div class="indent1"><span class="nm">(j)</span><p><span class="cl">Question:</span> How do we learn this from the verse?</p></div>
<div class="indent1"><span class="nm">(k)</span><p><span class="cl">Answer (Rabah):</span> 'Bi'asecha' is the way you enter, i.e. on the right;</p></div>
<div class="indent2"><span class="nm">1.</span><p>(Most) people move their right foot first when they begin walking.</p></div>
<div class="indent2"><span class="nm">2.</span><p><span class="cl">(Rav Shmuel bar Acha):</span> "(A chest was put)... Etzel ha'Mizbe'ach mi'Yamin b'Vo Ish Beis Hash-m" (people enter the Mikdash from the east. The chest was on the right, on the side that people enter.)</p></div>
<div class="indent1"><span class="nm">(l)</span><p><span class="cl">Question:</span> Where do we find that R. Meir requires a Mezuzah when there is only one doorpost?</p></div>
<div class="indent1"><span class="nm">(m)</span><p><span class="cl">Answer (Beraisa - R. Meir):</span> A Mezuzah is required even if there is only one doorpost;</p></div>
<div class="indent2"><span class="nm">1.</span><p>Chachamim exempt.</p></div>
<div class="indent1"><span class="nm">(n)</span><p><span class="cl">Question:</span> What is Chachamim's reason?</p></div>
<div class="indent1"><span class="nm">(o)</span><p><span class="cl">Answer:</span> It says "Mezuzos". (The plural teaches that there must be two doorposts.)</p></div>
<div class="indent1"><span class="nm">(p)</span><p><span class="cl">Question:</span> What is R. Meir's reason?</p></div>
<div class="indent1"><span class="nm">(q)</span><p><span class="cl">Answer (Beraisa - R. Yishmael):</span> "Mezuzos" teaches that there must be two doorposts;</p></div>
<div class="indent2"><span class="nm">1.</span><p><span class="cl">Question:</span> Why does it repeat "Mezuzos" (plural) in the second Parshah?</p></div>
<div class="indent2"><span class="nm">2.</span><p><span class="cl">Answer:</span> This is a Ribuy followed by another Ribuy. This always comes to exclude;</p></div>
<div class="indent3"><span class="nm">i.</span><p>We exclude (the need for) one of the two doorposts.</p></div>
<div class="indent2"><span class="nm">3.</span><p><span class="cl">R. Akiva:</span> We need not expound that way! It says (to put the blood of Korban Pesach in Mitzrayim) "... v'Al Shtei ha'Mezuzos";</p></div>
<div class="indent3"><span class="nm">i.</span><p><span class="cl">Question:</span> Why must it say "Shtei"? We would have known that "Mezuzos" refers to two!</p></div>
<div class="indent3"><span class="nm">ii.</span><p><span class="cl">Answer:</span> This teaches that whenever it says 'Mezuzos' without specifying two, it refers to one.</p></div>
<div class="subject"><span class="nm">2)</span><p>WHY WE DO NOT WRITE DIRECTLY ON THE DOORPOST</p></div>
<div class="indent1"><span class="nm">(a)</span><p><span class="cl">(Beraisa) Suggestion:</span> Perhaps "u'Chsavtam" teaches that the Parshiyos should be written on the actual stones (of the doorpost)!</p></div>
<div class="indent1"><span class="nm">(b)</span><p><span class="cl">Rejection:</span> It says here 'Kesivah', like it says about a Get (Rashi; Tosfos - Megilas Sotah, or the extra Sefer Torah that a king writes);</p></div>
<div class="indent2"><span class="nm">1.</span><p>Just like there he writes in a Sefer, also here.</p></div>
<div class="indent1"><span class="nm">(c)</span><p><span class="cl">Question:</span> Perhaps we should say oppositely! It says here 'Kesivah', and it says there (writing the Torah on rocks in Har Eival - Devarim 27:8) 'Kesivah'. Just like there it is on rocks, also here!</p></div>
<div class="indent1"><span class="nm">(d)</span><p><span class="cl">Answer:</span> Let us see which is more similar. We learn Kesivah that applies to all generations from Kesivah that applies to all generations. We do not learn Kesivah that applies to all generations from Kesivah that does not apply to all generations;</p></div>
<div class="indent2"><span class="nm">1.</span><p>Also, it is like it says there "va'Yomer Lahem Baruch mi'Piv Yikra Elai Es ha'Devarim ha'Eleh va'Ani Kosev Al ha'Sefer ba'Deyo."</p></div>
<div class="indent1"><span class="nm">(e)</span><p><span class="cl">Question (Rav Acha brei d'Rava):</span> The Torah said "Al Mezuzos" (which connotes on the doorpost itself), and you say that we learn 'Kesivah' from 'Kesivah'?!</p></div>
<div class="indent1"><span class="nm">(f)</span><p><span class="cl">Answer (Rav Ashi):</span> It is written "u'Chsavtam" - Kesivah Tamah (i.e. in a Sefer), and then [we affix it] on the doorpost.</p></div>
<div class="indent1"><span class="nm">(g)</span><p><span class="cl">Question:</span> Since it is written "u'Chsavtam", why do we need a Gezeirah Shavah [to teach that we do not  write on the rocks?</p></div>
<div class="indent1"><span class="nm">(h)</span><p><span class="cl">Answer:</span> If not for the Gezeirah Shavah, one might have thought that we write on a rock and then fix it in the doorpost. [The Gezeirah Shavah] teaches that this is not so.</p></div>
<div class="subject"><span class="nm">3)</span><p>THE PARSHIYOS IN TEFILIN</p></div>
<div class="indent1"><span class="nm">(a)</span><p><span class="cl">(Mishnah):</span> The four Parshiyos in Tefilin are Me'akev each other. Even one Kesav (letter) is Me'akev.</p></div>
<div class="indent1"><span class="nm">(b)</span><p><span class="cl">Objection:</span> This is obvious! (We learn from Mezuzah. There it says "u'ChsavTam" - the Kesav must be Tam (complete).)</p></div>
<div class="indent1"><span class="nm">(c)</span><p><span class="cl">Answer #1 (Rav Yehudah):</span> The Mishnah teaches that even the Kotz (protrusion) of a 'Yud' is Me'akev.</p></div>
<div class="indent1"><span class="nm">(d)</span><p><span class="cl">Objection:</span> Also this is obvious! (If it is missing, the letter is invalid.)</p></div>
<div class="indent1"><span class="nm">(e)</span><p><span class="cl">Answer #2 (Rav Yehudah):</span> The Mishnah teaches that if a letter is not surrounded by blank parchment on all four sides, it is Pasul.</p></div>
<div class="bbbline">34b----------------------------------------34b</p></div>
<div class="indent1"><span class="nm">(f)</span><p><span class="cl">(Beraisa - R. Yishmael):</span> Two occurrences of 'Totafos' are written missing the 'Vov' (as if it says 'Totafas', singular). We only learn one from each of those, and two from "Totafos" written with a 'Vov', making four in all. This teaches that there are four compartments in the head Tefilin;</p></div>
<div class="indent2"><span class="nm">1.</span><p>R. Akiva says, we need not expound this way. In Katfi (a place), 'Tot' means two. In Afriki, "Fos' means two.</p></div>
<div class="indent1"><span class="nm">(g)</span><p><span class="cl">(Beraisa) Suggestion:</span> Perhaps the four Parshiyos should be written on four parchments, and each is put in its own Bayis (box) made from a separate piece of hide!</p></div>
<div class="indent1"><span class="nm">(h)</span><p><span class="cl">Rejection:</span> "Ul'Zikaron Bein Einecha" - it should be only one commemoration;</p></div>
<div class="indent2"><span class="nm">1.</span><p>To fulfill both verses, the four Parshiyos are written on separate parchments, each is put in its own Bayis, and all four Batim are made from one piece of hide;</p></div>
<div class="indent2"><span class="nm">2.</span><p>If the Parshiyos were written on one parchment and (the Klaf was folded like an accordion, so) each Parshah was in its own Bayis, this is Kosher.</p></div>
<div class="indent2"><span class="nm">3.</span><p>Rebbi says, there must be a space between the Parshiyos (Rashi; Rosh - between the Batim);</p></div>
<div class="indent2"><span class="nm">4.</span><p>Chachamim say, there need not be.</p></div>
<div class="indent2"><span class="nm">5.</span><p>All agree that a string must separate the Batim (some say, only if the Parshiyos are on one parchment). If the separation between Batim is not recognizable (from the outside), it is Pasul.</p></div>
<div class="indent1"><span class="nm">(i)</span><p><span class="cl">(Beraisa):</span> The Parshiyos for the Shel Yad (the hand Tefilah) are written on one parchment;</p></div>
<div class="indent2"><span class="nm">1.</span><p>If they were written on separate parchments and put in one Bayis, this is Kosher;</p></div>
<div class="indent2"><span class="nm">2.</span><p>R. Yehudah says, the parchment must be glued (or sewn) together - "v'Hayah Lecha l'Os Al Yadecha." Just like externally there is only one Os (i.e. Bayis), also internally (there must be only one parchment).</p></div>
<div class="indent2"><span class="nm">3.</span><p>R. Yosi says, one need not attach the parchments.</p></div>
<div class="indent2"><span class="nm">4.</span><p><span class="cl">R. Yosi:</span> R. Yehudah agrees that if one has two head Tefilin but no Shel Yad, he wraps leather around one of them (so it will appear like one Bayis) and ties it on his arm.</p></div>
<div class="indent1"><span class="nm">(j)</span><p><span class="cl">Objection:</span> R. Yehudah argues precisely in this case. He says that there must be only one parchment inside!</p></div>
<div class="indent1"><span class="nm">(k)</span><p><span class="cl">Answer (Rava):</span> From R. Yosi's words we learn that R. Yehudah retracted.</p></div>
<div class="indent1"><span class="nm">(l)</span><p><span class="cl">Question:</span> R. Chananyah said in the name of R. Yochanan that the Shel Yad may be used for the head, but not vice-versa, because we ascend in Kedushah, but we do not descend! (If R. Yehudah retracted, this is not like either Tana.)</p></div>
<div class="indent1"><span class="nm">(m)</span><p><span class="cl">Answer:</span> R. Yosi permits using a Tefilah prepared (but not yet used) for the head for the hand (this is not considered descending in Kedushah), but not if it was worn on the head.</p></div>
<div class="indent2"><span class="nm">1.</span><p>According to the opinion that preparation has significance, we must say that he stipulated from the beginning that he may use it for the hand.</p></div>
<div class="indent1"><span class="nm">(n)</span><p><span class="cl">(Beraisa #1):</span> The order of the Parshiyos, from the right, is "Kadesh Li" and "Ki Yevi'acha." "Shma" and "v'Hayah Im Shamo'a" are on the left. (Rashi - Shma is next to Ki Yevi'acha; R. Tam - Shma is on the far left.)</p></div>
<div class="indent1"><span class="nm">(o)</span><p><span class="cl">Contradiction:</span> Another Beraisa (#2) gives the opposite order!</p></div>
<div class="indent1"><span class="nm">(p)</span><p><span class="cl">Answer (Abaye):</span> Beraisa #1 gives the order (from right to left) from the perspective of someone facing the wearer. Beraisa #2 is with respect to the wearer (Rashi; Shimusha Raba switches these.)</p></div>
