<div class="subject"><span class="nm">1)</span><p>TWO VERSES ARE NEEDED TO SHOW THAT WE READ IN ADAR SHENI</p></div>
<div class="indent1"><span class="nm">(a)</span><p>Had it said only "In every year and year", one might have thought that we always read in the month next to Shevat;</p></div>
<div class="indent1"><span class="nm">(b)</span><p>Had it said only "ha'Shenis", one might have thought that l'Chatchilah we read in the first and second [Adars in a leap year]. "In every year and year" teaches that this is not so.</p></div>
<div class="indent1"><span class="nm">(c)</span><p>R. Eliezer expounds "ha'Shenis" like Rav Shmuel bar Yehudah.</p></div>
<div class="indent2"><span class="nm">1.</span><p><span class="cl">(Rav Shmuel bar Yehudah):</span> At first, Purim was enacted in Shushan; later, it was enacted everywhere.</p></div>
<div class="subject"><span class="nm">2)</span><p>MAKING MEGILAS ESTHER PART OF KESUVIM</p></div>
<div class="indent1"><span class="nm">(a)</span><p><span class="cl">(Rav Shmuel bar Yehudah):</span> Esther asked Chachamim to enact Purim to be a Yom Tov. They replied that this would arouse the jealousy of the nations.</p></div>
<div class="indent2"><span class="nm">1.</span><p><span class="cl">Esther:</span> This is not a concern, since the story is already part of the Persian/Median chronicles.</p></div>
<div class="indent1"><span class="nm">(b)</span><p>Whenever Rav, Rav Chanina, R. Yochanan, and R. Chaviva are taught together in Seder Mo'ed, R. Yonason should be in place of R. Yochanan.</p></div>
<div class="indent1"><span class="nm">(c)</span><p>Esther asked Chachamim to make Megilas Esther part of Kesuvim.</p></div>
<div class="indent1"><span class="nm">(d)</span><p>Chachamim answered, "I have written (about war with Amalek) three times" (in Shmos, Devarim and Sefer Shmuel), it should not be written a fourth time!</p></div>
<div class="indent1"><span class="nm">(e)</span><p>Later, they consented because they expounded "Write this as a remembrance in a Safer";</p></div>
<div class="indent2"><span class="nm">1.</span><p>"Write this" refers to Milchemes Amalek in Shmos and Devarim (they count like one time);</p></div>
<div class="indent2"><span class="nm">2.</span><p>"A remembrance" - refers to what is recorded in Shmuel;</p></div>
<div class="indent2"><span class="nm">3.</span><p>"In a Sefer" is Megilas Esther.</p></div>
<div class="indent1"><span class="nm">(f)</span><p>In a Beraisa R. Yehoshua holds like Chachamim's initial refusal, and R. Eliezer ha'Moda'i holds like their conclusion.</p></div>
<div class="indent1"><span class="nm">(g)</span><p><span class="cl">(Rav Yehudah citing Shmuel):</span> If one touches a Megilah, his hands do not become Tamei (other Kisvei ha'Kodesh are Metamei hands).</p></div>
<div class="indent2"><span class="nm">1.</span><p><span class="cl">Inference:</span> Shmuel holds that Megilas Esther was not authored with Ru'ach ha'Kodesh.</p></div>
<div class="indent2"><span class="nm">2.</span><p><span class="cl">Question:</span> Shmuel said that it was authored with Ru'ach ha'Kodesh!</p></div>
<div class="indent2"><span class="nm">3.</span><p><span class="cl">Answer:</span> It was authored with Ru'ach ha'Kodesh to be read (by heart), but not to be written.</p></div>
<div class="indent1"><span class="nm">(h)</span><p><span class="cl">Question (Beraisa):</span> R. Meir says that (Beis Hillel and Beis Shamai agree that) Koheles is not Metamei hands; they argue about Shir ha'Shirim;</p></div>
<div class="indent2"><span class="nm">1.</span><p>R. Yosi says that Shir ha'Shirim is Metamei hands, they argue about Koheles;</p></div>
<div class="indent2"><span class="nm">2.</span><p>R. Shimon says that regarding Koheles (whether or not it is Metamei hands) Beis Shamai are more lenient than Beis Hillel, but Rus, Shir ha'Shirim and Megilas Esther are all Metamei hands.</p></div>
<div class="indent1"><span class="nm">(i)</span><p><span class="cl">Answer:</span> Shmuel holds like R. Yehoshua (above (f), that Megilas Esther should not have been written).</p></div>
<div class="indent1"><span class="nm">(j)</span><p><span class="cl">(Beraisa):</span> R. Shimon ben Menasiya says that Koheles is not Metamei hands, because it is merely the wisdom of Shlomo;</p></div>
<div class="indent2"><span class="nm">1.</span><p><span class="cl">Chachamim:</span> Was this all his wisdom?! "Shlomo said 3000 parables" (since he wrote only some, presumably he wrote those said with Ru'ach ha'Kodesh). It also says "Do not add to his words (i.e. Hash-m's words; only write what was given with Ru'ach ha'Kodesh)."</p></div>
<div class="indent2"><span class="nm">2.</span><p><span class="cl">Question:</span> Why did Chachamim need a second verse?</p></div>
<div class="indent2"><span class="nm">3.</span><p><span class="cl">Answer:</span> One might have thought that his parables were not from Hash-m, and he chose to write some of them.</p></div>
<div class="indent1"><span class="nm">(k)</span><p><span class="cl">(Beraisa - R. Eliezer):</span> Megilas Esther was written with Ru'ach ha'Kodesh. We learn from "Haman said in his heart (the king wants to honor me)";</p></div>
<div class="indent2"><span class="nm">1.</span><p>R. Akiva says, we learn from "Esther bore grace in the eyes of all who saw her."</p></div>
<div class="indent2"><span class="nm">2.</span><p>R. Meir learns from "The matter became known to Mordechai."</p></div>
<div class="indent2"><span class="nm">3.</span><p>R. Yosi ben Dormaskis learns from "They did not take from the spoils."</p></div>
<div class="indent1"><span class="nm">(l)</span><p><span class="cl">(Shmuel):</span> Better than all these sources is "they fulfilled and accepted" - they fulfilled in Heaven what they accepted below.</p></div>
<div class="indent1"><span class="nm">(m)</span><p><span class="cl">(Rava):</span> We may dispel all the proofs (for all of these could be known without Ru'ach ha'Kodesh), except for Shmuel's:</p></div>
<div class="indent2"><span class="nm">1.</span><p><span class="cl">(R. Eliezer's proof):</span> Haman reasoned that he is most important to the king. Since Haman suggested giving so much honor, this shows that he thought it was for himself.</p></div>
<div class="indent2"><span class="nm">2.</span><p><span class="cl">(R. Akiva's proof):</span> Perhaps, Esther appeared to each person as if she was from his nation, like R. Eliezer taught.</p></div>
<div class="indent2"><span class="nm">3.</span><p><span class="cl">(R. Meir's):</span> R. Chiya bar Aba said that Bigsan and Teresh were Tarsiyim (and Mordechai understood their language).</p></div>
<div class="indent2"><span class="nm">4.</span><p><span class="cl">(R. Yosi Ban Dormaskis'):</span> Perhaps Yisraelim in all Medinos sent a message that they did not take spoils.</p></div>
<div class="indent1"><span class="nm">(n)</span><p><span class="cl">(Ravina):</span> This is like people say, one sharp pepper (Shmuel's source, which cannot be rejected) is better than baskets full of gourds.</p></div>
<div class="indent1"><span class="nm">(o)</span><p><span class="cl">(Rav Yosef):</span> We may learn (that it was written with Ru'ach ha'Kodesh) from "These days of Purim will not pass from the Yehudim".</p></div>
<div class="indent1"><span class="nm">(p)</span><p><span class="cl">(Rav Nachman bar Yitzchak):</span> We may learn from "Their memory will not pass from their seed."</p></div>
<div class="subject"><span class="nm">3)</span><p>MATANOS L'EVYONIM AND MISHLO'ACH MANOS</p></div>
<div class="indent1"><span class="nm">(a)</span><p><span class="cl">(Rav Yosef):</span> One must give two portions (of food) to a friend, and two gifts to two poor people.</p></div>
<div class="indent1"><span class="nm">(b)</span><p>R. Yehudah Nesiah sent a leg of a third-born calf and a barrel of wine to R. Oshaya. R. Oshaya replied, Rabeinu, you fulfilled Mishlo'ach Manos (and Matanos l'Evyonim. Bach and Gra delete this from the text. They do not explain what is the Chidush that he was Yotzei Mishlo'ach Manos. Perhaps one might have thought that both portions must be solid food, or that giving to a Talmid does not fulfill "l'Re'ehu". Alternatively, perhaps R. Oshaya was very rich and (only) a big gift like this gave him enough Simchah for the sender to be Yotzei.)</p></div>
<div class="bbbline">7b----------------------------------------7b</p></div>
<div class="indent1"><span class="nm">(c)</span><p>Rabah made Abaye a Shali'ach to give a bag of dates and a cup of (sweet) flour from dried wheat to Mari bar Mar.</p></div>
<div class="indent2"><span class="nm">1.</span><p><span class="cl">Abaye (to Rabah):</span> Mari will say, if a farmer will become king, he still carries his basket on his neck! (One would expect a more distinguished gift from the Rosh Yeshiva.)</p></div>
<div class="indent1"><span class="nm">(d)</span><p>Mari made Abaye a Shali'ach to give to Rabah a sack of ginger and a cup of peppers.</p></div>
<div class="indent2"><span class="nm">1.</span><p><span class="cl">Abaye told Mari:</span> Rabah will say, I sent to him sweet food, and he sends to me sharp food!</p></div>
<div class="indent2"><span class="nm">2.</span><p><span class="cl">(Abaye):</span> When I left Rabah's house, I was satiated; when I reached Mari's house, they served me 60 bowls of 60 types of food, and I ate 60 pieces.</p></div>
<div class="indent2"><span class="nm">3.</span><p>The last course was a pot roast; I wanted to eat the plate afterwards!</p></div>
<div class="indent2"><span class="nm">4.</span><p>This is like people say, a poor person is famished and does not know it. Alternatively, there is always  room to eat something tasty.</p></div>
<div class="indent1"><span class="nm">(e)</span><p>Abaye bar Avin and R. Chanina bar Avin used to exchange their meals (to fulfill Mishlo'ach Manos - Rambam, Shulchan Aruch. Rashi explains that they would alternate hosting each other on Purim.)</p></div>
<div class="subject"><span class="nm">4)</span><p>HALACHOS OF THE PURIM SEUDAH</p></div>
<div class="indent1"><span class="nm">(a)</span><p><span class="cl">(Rava):</span> A person is obligated to become drunk on Purim until he cannot distinguish 'cursed is Haman' from 'blessed is Mordechai.'</p></div>
<div class="indent1"><span class="nm">(b)</span><p>Rabah and R. Zeira ate their Purim Seudah together; Rabah got drunk and slaughtered R. Zeira. The next day he prayed, and restored him to life.</p></div>
<div class="indent2"><span class="nm">1.</span><p>The next year, Rabah invited R. Zeira to eat with him again. R. Zeira declined, because miracles do not always happen.</p></div>
<div class="indent1"><span class="nm">(c)</span><p><span class="cl">(Rava):</span> One who eats the Purim Seudah at night did not fulfill the Mitzvah - it says "<i>days</i> of Mishteh and Simchah."</p></div>
<div class="indent1"><span class="nm">(d)</span><p>Rav Ashi was by Rav Kahana; he asked why the Talmidim were not coming to learn.</p></div>
<div class="indent1"><span class="nm">(e)</span><p><span class="cl">Rav Kahana:</span> Perhaps they are busy having the Purim Seudah.</p></div>
<div class="indent1"><span class="nm">(f)</span><p><span class="cl">Rav Ashi:</span> They should have eaten it last night!</p></div>
<div class="indent1"><span class="nm">(g)</span><p><span class="cl">Rav Kahana:</span> Didn't you hear Rava's teaching?!</p></div>
<div class="indent1"><span class="nm">(h)</span><p>Rav Ashi learned the Halachah 40 times, and was secure of it as if it was in his pocket.</p></div>
<div class="subject"><span class="nm">5)</span><p>DIFFERENCES BETWEEN SHABBOS, YOM TOV, AND YOM KIPUR</p></div>
<div class="indent1"><span class="nm">(a)</span><p><span class="cl">(Mishnah):</span> The only difference between Shabbos and Yom Tov is preparation of food.</p></div>
<div class="indent1"><span class="nm">(b)</span><p><span class="cl">(Gemara) Inference:</span> They are the same regarding Machshirim (preliminary preparations).</p></div>
<div class="indent1"><span class="nm">(c)</span><p>Our Mishnah is not like R. Yehudah:</p></div>
<div class="indent2"><span class="nm">1.</span><p><span class="cl">(Beraisa):</span> The only difference between Shabbos and Yom Tov is preparation of food;</p></div>
<div class="indent2"><span class="nm">2.</span><p>R. Yehudah permits Machshirim.</p></div>
<div class="indent2"><span class="nm">3.</span><p>The first Tana expounds "Hu" (food preparation is permitted) - but not Machshirim;</p></div>
<div class="indent2"><span class="nm">4.</span><p>R. Yehudah expounds "Lachem" - all your needs are permitted.</p></div>
<div class="indent2"><span class="nm">5.</span><p><span class="cl">Question:</span> What does the first Tana learn from "Lachem"?</p></div>
<div class="indent2"><span class="nm">6.</span><p><span class="cl">Answer:</span> It forbids Meleches Ochel Nefesh for Nochrim or dogs.</p></div>
<div class="indent2"><span class="nm">7.</span><p><span class="cl">Question:</span> What does R. Yehudah learn from "Hu"?</p></div>
<div class="indent2"><span class="nm">8.</span><p><span class="cl">Answer:</span> "Hu" forbids Machshirim that could have been done before Yom Tov, and Lachem permits those that could not.</p></div>
<div class="indent1"><span class="nm">(d)</span><p><span class="cl">(Mishnah):</span> The only difference between Shabbos and Yom Kipur is that the punishment for Melachah on Shabbos b'Mezid is through Beis Din (stoning), and that for Yom Kipur is through Shamayim (Kares).</p></div>
<div class="indent1"><span class="nm">(e)</span><p><span class="cl">(Gemara) Inference:</span> There is no difference regarding paying for damage done via a Melachah.</p></div>
<div class="indent1"><span class="nm">(f)</span><p>Our Mishnah is like R. Nechunya ben Hakanah:</p></div>
<div class="indent2"><span class="nm">1.</span><p><span class="cl">(Beraisa - R. Nechunya ben Hakanah):</span> Yom Kipur is like Shabbos regarding payment.</p></div>
<div class="indent2"><span class="nm">2.</span><p>Just as one is Chayav Misah for Chilul Shabbos and exempt from payment, also for Yom Kipur.</p></div>
<div class="indent1"><span class="nm">(g)</span><p><span class="cl">(Mishnah - R. Chananyah ben Gamliel):</span> Anyone who was Chayav Kares who was lashed is exempted from Kares.</p></div>
<div class="indent2"><span class="nm">1.</span><p>We learn from "And you saw your brother disgraced" - once he is lashed, he is like your brother.</p></div>
<div class="indent1"><span class="nm">(h)</span><p><span class="cl">( R. Yochanan):</span> The other Tana'im argue with R. Chananyah.</p></div>
<div class="indent1"><span class="nm">(i)</span><p><span class="cl">Support (Rava - Mishnah):</span> The only difference... the punishment for Chilul Shabbos is through Beis Din, and that for Chilul Yom Kipur is through Shamayim.</p></div>
<div class="indent2"><span class="nm">1.</span><p>According to R. Chananyah, also Yom Kipur is punishable through Beis Din (lashes)!</p></div>
<div class="indent1"><span class="nm">(j)</span><p><span class="cl">Rejection #1 (Rav Nachman bar Yitzchak):</span> Perhaps our Mishnah is like R. Yitzchak, who says that there are no lashes for Chayavei Kerisos.</p></div>
<div class="indent2"><span class="nm">1.</span><p><span class="cl">(Beraisa - R. Yitzchak):</span> The Torah mentioned Kares regarding relations with one's sister to teach that the punishment is Kares, and not lashes.</p></div>
<div class="indent1"><span class="nm">(k)</span><p><span class="cl">Rejection #2 (Rav Ashi):</span> Our Mishnah can be like Chachamim that argue with R. Yitzchak (and it is like R. Chananyah) - it teaches that the primary punishment for Yom Kipur is Kares.</p></div>
