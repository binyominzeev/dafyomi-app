<p class="dedicationbox">SHEVUOS 41 - Two weeks of study material have been dedicated by Mrs. Estanne Abraham Fawer to honor the Yahrzeit of her father, Rav Mordechai ben Eliezer Zvi (Rabbi Morton Weiner) Z'L, who passed away on 18 Teves 5760. May the merit of supporting and advancing Dafyomi study -- which was so important to him -- during the weeks of his Yahrzeit serve as an Iluy for his Neshamah. </p>

<p class="bas subject"><span class="nm">1)</span>OATHS, BOTH MID'ORAISA AND MID'RABANAN</p>
<p class="bas indent1"><span class="nm">(a)</span><span class="cl">Question:</span> What is the difference between mid'Oraisa and mid'Rabanan oaths?</p>
<p class="bas indent1"><span class="nm">(b)</span><span class="cl">Answer:</span> The defendant cannot reverse an oath mid'Oraisa (refuse to swear, and demand that the claimant swear if he wants to collect). He can reverse an oath mid'Rabanan (of Heses).</p>
<p class="bas indent1"><span class="nm">(c)</span><span class="cl">Question:</span> Mar bar Rav Ashi holds that he can reverse even an oath mid'Oraisa;</p>
<p class="bas indent2"><span class="nm">1.</span>What will he say is the difference between mid'Oraisa and mid'Rabanan oaths?</p>
<p class="bas indent1"><span class="nm">(d)</span><span class="cl">Answer:</span> For mid'Oraisa oaths, if the defendant refuses to swear, Beis Din sells his property to pay the claimant. Beis Din does not do so for mid'Rabanan oaths.</p>
<p class="bas indent1"><span class="nm">(e)</span><span class="cl">Question:</span> What is the difference according to R. Yosi, who holds that Beis Din collects from his property even for mid'Rabanan (laws, including) oaths?</p>
<p class="bas indent2"><span class="nm">1.</span><span class="cl">(Mishnah):</span> It was enacted for the sake of Shalom that if a child, lunatic or deaf-mute takes an object of Hefker, it is considered theft if someone takes it from him;</p>
<p class="bas indent2"><span class="nm">2.</span>R. Yosi says, it is absolute theft.</p>
<p class="bas indent2"><span class="nm">3.</span><span class="cl">(Rav Chisda):</span> He means that it is absolute theft mid'Rabanan.</p>
<p class="bas indent2"><span class="nm">4.</span><span class="cl">Question:</span> What do the Tana'im argue about?</p>
<p class="bas indent2"><span class="nm">5.</span><span class="cl">Answer:</span> R. Yosi holds that Beis Din returns it to the child, lunatic or deaf-mute. Chachamim hold that they do not.</p>
<p class="bas indent1"><span class="nm">(f)</span><span class="cl">Answer:</span> For mid'Oraisa oaths, if the defendant is disqualified from swearing, we reverse the oath onto the claimant, and then the defendant must pay;</p>
<p class="bas indent2"><span class="nm">1.</span>Mid'Rabanan oaths are enactments. We do not make an enactment (to reverse the oath when he is disqualified from swearing) for an enactment (rather, he is exempt).</p>
<p class="bas indent1"><span class="nm">(g)</span><span class="cl">Question:</span> According to Chachamim (of R. Yosi), if the defendant refuses to swear a mid'Rabanan oath, Beis Din does not sell his property to pay the claimant. How do we induce him to pay?</p>
<p class="bas indent1"><span class="nm">(h)</span><span class="cl">Answer #1:</span> We excommunicate him (until he pays).</p>
<p class="bas indent1"><span class="nm">(i)</span><span class="cl">Objection (Ravina):</span> That is the ultimate coercion to pay!</p>
<p class="bas indent1"><span class="nm">(j)</span><span class="cl">Answer #2 (Rav Ashi):</span> We excommunicate him until the time to lash him (i.e. after he endures 30 days), then the Niduy is lifted.</p>
<p class="bas indent1"><span class="nm">(k)</span><span class="cl">(Rav Papa):</span> If Reuven showed a document saying that Shimon owes him, and Shimon claimed he paid, he is not believed. We tell him to pay;</p>
<p class="bas indent2"><span class="nm">1.</span>If Shimon asked Reuven to swear that he was not paid, Reuven must swear.</p>
<p class="bas indent1"><span class="nm">(l)</span><span class="cl">Question (Rav Acha brei d'Rava):</span> (A Mishnah teaches that) if a document was partially paid, the claimant must swear to collect. Rav Papa says so about every document!</p>
<p class="bas indent1"><span class="nm">(m)</span><span class="cl">Answer (Rav Ashi):</span> If a document was partially paid, <i>we</i> (Beis Din) insist that the claimant swear to collect;</p>
<p class="bas indent2"><span class="nm">1.</span>If it was not paid at all, we tell the defendant to pay. If he asks the claimant to swear, he must swear.</p>
<p class="bas indent2"><span class="nm">2.</span>A Chacham need not swear.</p>
<p class="bas indent2"><span class="nm">3.</span><span class="cl">Objection:</span> May a Chacham freely take others' money?!</p>
<p class="bas indent2"><span class="nm">4.</span><span class="cl">Version #1 (Rashi) Answer:</span> Rather, we do not allow a Chacham to swear (therefore, he does not collect).</p>
<p class="bas indent2"><span class="nm">5.</span><span class="cl">Version #2 (Tosfos ha'Rosh) Answer:</span> Rather, we do not tell a Chacham to swear. (If he seizes the money, he keeps it. If he wants to swear and collect, he may.)</p>
<p class="bas subject"><span class="nm">2)</span>MUST A LOAN BE REPAID IN FRONT OF WITNESSES?</p>
<p class="bas indent1"><span class="nm">(a)</span><span class="cl">(Mishnah):</span> If Reuven claimed a Maneh from Shimon...</p>
<p class="bas indent1"><span class="nm">(b)</span><span class="cl">Version #1 (Rav Yehudah citing Rav Asi):</span> If Levi lent Yehudah in front of witnesses, Yehudah must repay in front of witnesses. (If he cannot bring witnesses that he repaid, he must pay (again));</p>
<p class="bas indent1"><span class="nm">(c)</span><span class="cl">(Rav Yehudah citing Shmuel):</span> Yehudah can say 'I paid in front of Ploni and Almoni, and they went abroad.' (Tosfos - he is even believed to say 'I paid you without witnesses, Migo he could have said 'I paid in front of Ploni and Almoni, they went abroad.' Rashba - he is not believed to say that he paid without witnesses.)</p>
<p class="bas indent1"><span class="nm">(d)</span><span class="cl">Question (Mishnah):</span> If Reuven claimed a Maneh from Shimon in front of witnesses, and Shimon admitted that he owes it, and the next day, Reuven claimed it again, if Shimon answers 'I paid you', he is exempt.</p>
<p class="bas indent2"><span class="nm">1.</span>Claiming money in front of witnesses is like lending in front of witnesses, yet Shimon need not bring witnesses that he repaid. This refutes Rav Asi!</p>
<p class="bas bbbline">41b----------------------------------------41b</p>
<p class="bas indent1"><span class="nm">(e)</span><span class="cl">Answer:</span> (Claiming money in front of witnesses is <i>not</i> like lending in front of witnesses.) In the Mishnah, the loan was given without witnesses. Reuven showed that he trusted Shimon (so Shimon need not repay with witnesses);</p>
<p class="bas indent2"><span class="nm">1.</span>Rav Asi's law is only when the loan was in front of witnesses.</p>
<p class="bas indent1"><span class="nm">(f)</span><span class="cl">Version #2 (Rav Yosef) (Rav Yehudah citing Rav Asi):</span> If Levi lent Yehudah in front of witnesses, Yehudah need not repay in front of witnesses, unless Levi stipulated that he must do so;</p>
<p class="bas indent1"><span class="nm">(g)</span><span class="cl">(Rav Yehudah citing Shmuel):</span> (Even if Levi stipulated) Yehudah can say 'I paid in front of Ploni and Almoni, and they went abroad.'</p>
<p class="bas indent1"><span class="nm">(h)</span><span class="cl">Question (Mishnah):</span> Reuven claimed a Maneh from Shimon in front of witnesses. Shimon admitted that he owes it. Reuven told him 'you must repay it in front of witnesses.' The next day, Reuven claimed it again, and Shimon said 'I paid you.' He is liable, for he must repay it in front of witnesses;</p>
<p class="bas indent2"><span class="nm">1.</span>This refutes Shmuel!</p>
<p class="bas indent1"><span class="nm">(i)</span><span class="cl">Answer:</span> Tana'im argue about this law.</p>
<p class="bas indent2"><span class="nm">1.</span><span class="cl">(Beraisa):</span> If Levi told Yehudah 'I (just) lent you in front of witnesses. Repay me in front of witnesses', if Yehudah cannot prove that he paid, he must pay (again);</p>
<p class="bas indent2"><span class="nm">2.</span>R. Yehudah ben Beseira says, Yehudah can say 'I paid in front of Ploni and Almoni, and they went abroad.'</p>
<p class="bas indent1"><span class="nm">(j)</span><span class="cl">Objection (Rav Acha):</span> Perhaps (in the Beraisa) Levi does not speak at the time of the loan, rather, later!</p>
<p class="bas indent2"><span class="nm">1.</span>Levi told Yehudah 'since I lent to you in front of witnesses, you should have repaid me in front of witnesses';</p>
<p class="bas indent2"><span class="nm">2.</span>The Tana'im argue in this case, but if Levi stipulated at the time of the loan, all agree that Yehudah must prove that he paid! (Neither Tana holds like Shmuel.)</p>
<p class="bas indent1"><span class="nm">(k)</span><span class="cl">(Rav Papi citing Rava):</span> The Halachah is, if Levi lent Yehudah in front of witnesses, Yehudah must repay in front of witnesses.</p>
<p class="bas indent1"><span class="nm">(l)</span><span class="cl">(Rav Papa citing Rava):</span> The Halachah is, if Levi lent Yehudah in front of witnesses, Yehudah need not repay in front of witnesses, unless Levi stipulated that he must do so;</p>
<p class="bas indent2"><span class="nm">1.</span>Yehudah is (Rif's text - not) believed to say 'I paid in front of Ploni and Almoni, and they went abroad.</p>
<p class="bas indent1"><span class="nm">(m)</span><span class="cl">(Abaye):</span> If Reuven lent Shimon, and told him 'repay me in front of Ploni and Almoni', and Shimon paid in front of other witnesses, this is all that Reuven wanted (Shimon is exempt);</p>
<p class="bas indent1"><span class="nm">(n)</span><span class="cl">(Rava):</span> No, he specified Ploni and Almoni, in order that Shimon cannot push him off (Rashi - with lying witnesses; Tosfos - by naming witnesses who went abroad).</p>
<p class="bas indent1"><span class="nm">(o)</span>Levi lent Yehudah, and told him 'repay me in front of two witnesses who learn Halachah. Yehudah paid without witnesses, and the money was lost through Ones. They came in front of Rav Nachman.</p>
<p class="bas indent2"><span class="nm">1.</span><span class="cl">Levi:</span> I stipulated that the repayment must be in front of witnesses who learn Halachah. I took the money for a deposit until we would find such witnesses.</p>
<p class="bas indent2"><span class="nm">2.</span><span class="cl">Rav Nachman:</span> He gave the money for payment, and you accepted it without objection (this shows that you pardoned your stipulation);</p>
<p class="bas indent3"><span class="nm">i.</span>If you want, fulfill your stipulation now in front of Rav Sheshes and myself. We learn Halachah! (This was a joke.)</p>
<p class="bas indent1"><span class="nm">(p)</span>Reuven claimed a Maneh from Shimon. Shimon denied that he ever owed him. Reuven brought witnesses that Shimon borrowed and paid.</p>
<p class="bas indent1"><span class="nm">(q)</span><span class="cl">(Abaye):</span> We cannot obligate him to pay, for the witnesses who say that he borrowed say that he paid!</p>
<p class="bas indent1"><span class="nm">(r)</span><span class="cl">(Rava):</span> Since he says that he did not borrow, this is an admission that he did not pay (and one is believed to obligate himself even if witnesses contradict him).</p>
<p class="bas subject"><span class="nm">3)</span>THINGS ONE NEED NOT KNOW</p>
<p class="bas indent1"><span class="nm">(a)</span>Reuven claimed a Maneh from Shimon. Shimon said 'I paid you in front of Ploni and Almoni.' Ploni and Almoni said that they never saw this.</p>
<p class="bas indent1"><span class="nm">(b)</span><span class="cl">(Rav Sheshes):</span> Shimon is Huchzak Kafran (established to be a liar. He is no longer believed to say 'I paid you not in front of them.')</p>
<p class="bas indent1"><span class="nm">(c)</span><span class="cl">(Rava):</span> No. Anything that is not incumbent on a person (Rashi - Shimon need not name witnesses that saw payment; R. Chananel - the witnesses were not asked to witness the payment), he is not mindful about it (therefore, Shimon is not Huchzak Kafran).</p>
