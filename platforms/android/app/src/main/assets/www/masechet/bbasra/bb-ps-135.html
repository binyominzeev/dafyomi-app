<p class="bas subject"><span class="nm">1)</span>IS A MAN BELIEVED TO PERMIT HIS WIDOW TO REMARRY?</p>
<p class="bas indent1"><span class="nm">(a)</span>Reuven was about to die. (The Chazakah was that he has brothers, but not children.) They asked him 'will your wife need Yibum or Chalitzah?'</p>
<p class="bas indent2"><span class="nm">1.</span><span class="cl">Reuven:</span> She is fit for a Kohen Gadol. (He means only that she need not do Yibum or Chalitzah. The next line shows that he does not permit her to any Kohen.)</p>
<p class="bas indent1"><span class="nm">(b)</span><span class="cl">(Rava):</span> He is believed. R. Chiya bar Avin cited R. Yochanan to say that a man is believed to say that he divorced his wife (and surely, that is what he means).</p>
<p class="bas indent1"><span class="nm">(c)</span><span class="cl">Question (Abaye):</span> Rav Yitzchak bar Yosef cited R. Yochanan to say that a man is not believed to say that he divorced his wife!</p>
<p class="bas indent1"><span class="nm">(d)</span><span class="cl">Answer (Rava):</span> We already answered this. He is believed about the future, but not about the past.</p>
<p class="bas indent1"><span class="nm">(e)</span><span class="cl">Question (Abaye):</span> Will we rely on this answer?!</p>
<p class="bas indent1"><span class="nm">(f)</span><span class="cl">Rava (to Rav Noson bar Ami):</span> Be stringent. (Require Chalitzah, like Abaye.)</p>
<p class="bas indent1"><span class="nm">(g)</span>Reuven was about to die (he was Muchzak not to have brothers). He said 'I do not have brothers.'</p>
<p class="bas indent1"><span class="nm">(h)</span><span class="cl">(Rav Yosef):</span> We are not concerned (lest he has brothers):</p>
<p class="bas indent2"><span class="nm">1.</span>Firstly, he was Muchzak not to have brothers. Also, he said 'I do not have brothers'!</p>
<p class="bas indent1"><span class="nm">(i)</span><span class="cl">Abaye:</span> People are saying that witnesses overseas know that he has brothers!</p>
<p class="bas indent1"><span class="nm">(j)</span><span class="cl">Rav Yosef:</span> Since there are no witnesses in front of us we are not concerned, like R. Chanina taught:</p>
<p class="bas indent2"><span class="nm">1.</span><span class="cl">(R. Chanina):</span> (A woman told Beis Din that she was captured, but was not defiled. She is believed.) Will we forbid her because people are saying that witnesses overseas know that she was defiled?!</p>
<p class="bas indent1"><span class="nm">(k)</span><span class="cl">Question (Abaye):</span> We are lenient about a captured woman (because she makes herself repulsive, so her captors will not desire her). We cannot learn to be lenient to permit a woman to marry (when perhaps she needs Chalitzah)!</p>
<p class="bas indent1"><span class="nm">(l)</span><span class="cl">Rava (to Rav Noson bar Ami):</span> Be concerned for her (Rashbam - require Chalitzah (unless you can verify that he has no brothers); some say, permit her (R. Gershom)).</p>
<p class="bas subject"><span class="nm">2)</span>THE DUBIOUS BROTHER</p>
<p class="bas indent1"><span class="nm">(a)</span><span class="cl">(Mishnah):</span> If Reuven said 'this (Ploni) is my brother', he is not believed.</p>
<p class="bas indent1"><span class="nm">(b)</span><span class="cl">Question:</span> What do the other brothers say?</p>
<p class="bas indent2"><span class="nm">1.</span>If they admit 'he is our brother', they all divide equally!</p>
<p class="bas indent1"><span class="nm">(c)</span><span class="cl">Answer #1:</span> They say 'he is not our brother'.</p>
<p class="bas indent1"><span class="nm">(d)</span><span class="cl">Objection (Seifa):</span> If Ploni received property from another place (and died), all the brothers share it.</p>
<p class="bas indent2"><span class="nm">1.</span>Why do the others share it? They say that he is not their brother!</p>
<p class="bas indent1"><span class="nm">(e)</span><span class="cl">Answer #2:</span> They say 'we do not know whether he is our brother'.</p>
<p class="bas indent1"><span class="nm">(f)</span><span class="cl">(Rava):</span> This teaches that if Shimon says 'you owe to me 100 Zuz' and Levi says 'I do not know', he is exempt. (The brothers do not know whether they must share their inheritance with him, and they are exempt.)</p>
<p class="bas indent1"><span class="nm">(g)</span><span class="cl">Rejection (Abaye):</span> Perhaps Levi is liable. Here is different, for Reuven claims on behalf of someone else (Ploni himself did not claim).</p>
<p class="bas bbbline">135b----------------------------------------135b</p>
<p class="bas indent1"><span class="nm">(h)</span><span class="cl">(Mishnah):</span> When Ploni dies, Reuven gets back what Ploni took from Reuven's share.</p>
<p class="bas indent1"><span class="nm">(i)</span><span class="cl">(Rava):</span> If the property increased in value by itself, what is the law?</p>
<p class="bas indent2"><span class="nm">1.</span>If Ploni worked to increase the value (e.g. he farmed the land and it is laden with fruit), surely it is like property he received from elsewhere (the brothers share it);</p>
<p class="bas indent2"><span class="nm">2.</span>The question is when it increased in value by itself, e.g. a date tree became stronger or a river deposited soil on the land.</p>
<p class="bas indent1"><span class="nm">(j)</span>This question is not resolved.</p>
<p class="bas subject"><span class="nm">3)</span>THE GIFT OF A SHECHIV MERA</p>
<p class="bas indent1"><span class="nm">(a)</span><span class="cl">(Mishnah):</span> If Reuven died, and Daitiki (gift documents of a Shechiv Mera) were tied to his thigh, we ignore them.</p>
<p class="bas indent1"><span class="nm">(b)</span>If Reuven said 'I give to Ploni what is written in this document', whether or not Ploni could inherit Reuven, Ploni acquires.</p>
<p class="bas indent1"><span class="nm">(c)</span><span class="cl">(Beraisa):</span> A Daitiki is one that says 'Da Tehei l'MeiKam v'Lihyos' (this should be fulfilled, i.e. after death).</p>
<p class="bas indent2"><span class="nm">1.</span>A gift (of a healthy person) is one that says 'from today and after I die.'</p>
<p class="bas indent1"><span class="nm">(d)</span><span class="cl">Question:</span> If it says 'from now', is this not a gift?!</p>
<p class="bas indent1"><span class="nm">(e)</span><span class="cl">Answer (Abaye):</span> It means, a gift (of a healthy person) that is like a gift of a Shechiv Mera (it does not acquire until after he dies) is one that says 'from today and after I die'.</p>
<p class="bas indent1"><span class="nm">(f)</span><span class="cl">Version #1 (Rabah bar bar Chanah citing R. Yochanan):</span> If a Shechiv Mera said 'write and give 100 Zuz to Ploni' and died, we do not write and give after his death. Perhaps he wanted Ploni to acquire only through a document, and a document does not work after he died;</p>
<p class="bas indent2"><span class="nm">1.</span><span class="cl">R. Elazar:</span> This is the Halachah.</p>
<p class="bas indent1"><span class="nm">(g)</span><span class="cl">Version #2 - Rav Shizbi:</span> R. Elazar said the law, and R. Yochanan confirmed that this is the Halachah.</p>
<p class="bas indent1"><span class="nm">(h)</span><span class="cl">(Rav Nachman bar Yitzchak):</span> Presumably, Version #2 is correct. R. Elazar said the law and R. Yochanan confirmed it;</p>
<p class="bas indent2"><span class="nm">1.</span>Had R. Yochanan said the law, we would not need R. Elazar his Talmid to confirm it!</p>
<p class="bas indent1"><span class="nm">(i)</span>Also, Ravin said that R. Elazar sent a message to Bavel saying this law in Rav's name, and R. Yochanan said 'it must be checked'.</p>
<p class="bas indent1"><span class="nm">(j)</span><span class="cl">Question:</span> What does it mean 'it must be checked'? (The second teaching of Rav Dimi below will answer this question.)</p>
<p class="bas indent1"><span class="nm">(k)</span><span class="cl">Answer (Rav Dimi):</span> A Daitiki nullifies a previous Daitiki (it does not take effect until after death, so the giver can retract. The latter Daitiki shows that he retracted from the former);</p>
<p class="bas indent1"><span class="nm">(l)</span>If a Shechiv Mera said 'write and give 100 Zuz to Ploni' and died, we check. If he authorized the document to help Ploni (so he will have a proof of the gift), we write and give it. If not, we do not give it.</p>
<p class="bas indent1"><span class="nm">(m)</span><span class="cl">Question (R. Aba bar Mamal - Beraisa):</span> If a healthy person said 'write and give 100 Zuz to Ploni' and died, we do not write and give it after his death.</p>
<p class="bas indent2"><span class="nm">1.</span><span class="cl">Inference:</span> If a Shechiv Mera said 'write and give 100 Zuz to Ploni' and died, we write and give it (in any case)!</p>
<p class="bas indent1"><span class="nm">(n)</span><span class="cl">Answer (R. Aba bar Mamal):</span> We write and give it only if it was to help Ploni.</p>
<p class="bas indent1"><span class="nm">(o)</span><span class="cl">Question:</span> In what case is the document to help Ploni?</p>
