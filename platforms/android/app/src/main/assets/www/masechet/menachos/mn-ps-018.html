<div class="subject"><span class="nm">1)</span><p>INTENT TO LEAVE OVER</p></div>
<div class="indent1"><span class="nm">(a)</span><p><span class="cl">Answer #2:</span> There is a three-way argument in the Beraisa:</p></div>
<div class="indent2"><span class="nm">1.</span><p>The first Tana holds that they argue about improper intents. All agree that intent to leave over is Kosher;</p></div>
<div class="indent2"><span class="nm">2.</span><p>R. Yehudah holds that they argue about improper intents. All agree that intent to leave over is Pasul;</p></div>
<div class="indent3"><span class="nm">i.</span><p><span class="cl">Question:</span> What is the reason?</p></div>
<div class="indent3"><span class="nm">ii.</span><p><span class="cl">Answer:</span> We decree that intent to leave some of the blood (until tomorrow) is Pasul, due to intent to leave all of the blood, which is Pasul mid'Oraisa;</p></div>
<div class="indent3"><span class="nm">iii.</span><p><span class="cl">(Beraisa - R. Yehudah):</span> You (Chachamim) agree with me that if he left all of the blood until tomorrow, it is Pasul (because Zerikah was not done). Also intent to leave all of the blood is Pasul!</p></div>
<div class="indent2"><span class="nm">3.</span><p>R. Elazar says that they argue even about intent to leave over. R. Eliezer is Posel, and Chachamim Machshir.</p></div>
<div class="indent1"><span class="nm">(b)</span><p><span class="cl">Question (Beraisa - Rebbi):</span> When I went to learn from R. Elazar ben Shamu'a (to clarify my doubts, or to learn what R. Elazar knew that I did not know), I saw Yosef ha'Bavli learning in front of him.</p></div>
<div class="indent2"><span class="nm">1.</span><p><span class="cl">Yosef:</span> If one slaughtered a Korban with intent to leave some of the blood until tomorrow, what is the law?</p></div>
<div class="indent2"><span class="nm">2.</span><p><span class="cl">R. Elazar:</span> It is Kosher.</p></div>
<div class="indent2"><span class="nm">3.</span><p>R. Elazar repeated this answer that night, the next morning, and noontime. In the afternoon, he said 'it is Kosher; R. Eliezer is Posel.' Yosef beamed with delight.</p></div>
<div class="indent2"><span class="nm">4.</span><p><span class="cl">R. Elazar:</span> Do you think that what I said until now was not correct?!</p></div>
<div class="indent2"><span class="nm">5.</span><p><span class="cl">Yosef:</span> What you said until now was fine;</p></div>
<div class="indent3"><span class="nm">i.</span><p>I was delighted to hear that R. Eliezer is Posel, for R. Yehudah taught this to me, and I did not find anyone else who said so until now. You returned what I had lost! (I feared lest I forgot what I heard!)</p></div>
<div class="indent2"><span class="nm">6.</span><p><span class="cl">R. Elazar:</span> Happy are Chachamim, that Torah is so dear to them - "Mah Ahavti Sorasecha";</p></div>
<div class="indent3"><span class="nm">i.</span><p>Because R. Yehudah's father (R. Ilai) was a Talmid of R. Eliezer, he taught him R. Eliezer's opinion (that it is Pasul), even though it is not the Halachah.</p></div>
<div class="indent2"><span class="nm">7.</span><p><span class="cl">Summation of question:</span> If R. Yehudah holds that all disqualify intent to leave over, this is unlike R. Elazar (who said that they argue about this. Yosef would not have rejoiced to hear unlike what he was taught!)</p></div>
<div class="indent2"><span class="nm">8.</span><p><span class="cl">Counter-question:</span> You infer that R. Elazar taught exactly like R. Yehudah, i.e. it is Kosher, and R. Eliezer is Posel;</p></div>
<div class="indent3"><span class="nm">i.</span><p>If so, why did R. Elazar say that R. Yehudah taught thusly because he heard from his father, who was a Talmid of R. Eliezer? R. Elazar taught just the same!</p></div>
<div class="indent1"><span class="nm">(c)</span><p><span class="cl">Answer:</span> Rather, R. Yehudah taught (Stam) that all Tana'im are Posel;</p></div>
<div class="indent2"><span class="nm">1.</span><p>Yosef said 'you returned what I had lost', for at least he found someone else who says that (at least one Tana holds that) such intent is Posel.</p></div>
<div class="subject"><span class="nm">2)</span><p>WHICH AVODOS ARE ME'AKEV</p></div>
<div class="indent1"><span class="nm">(a)</span><p><span class="cl">(Mishnah):</span> (Even) if any of the following was not done to a Minchah, it is Kosher:</p></div>
<div class="indent2"><span class="nm">1.</span><p>Yetzikah (the third application of oil), Belilah (mixing with oil), Petisah (breaking it into pieces), salting, Tenufah, or Hagashah</p></div>
<div class="indent2"><span class="nm">2.</span><p>If it was broken into pieces Merubos (big, or many), or if oil was not smeared on it, it is Kosher.</p></div>
<div class="indent1"><span class="nm">(b)</span><p><span class="cl">(Gemara) Question:</span> What does it mean 'Yetzikah was not done'?</p></div>
<div class="indent2"><span class="nm">1.</span><p><span class="cl">Suggestion:</span> It was not done at all.</p></div>
<div class="indent2"><span class="nm">2.</span><p><span class="cl">Rejection:</span> The Torah teaches that it is Me'akev. (It repeated the command to do it. Aternatively, "vYatzakta... inchah Hi" implies that without Yetzikah, it is not a Minchah.)</p></div>
<div class="indent1"><span class="nm">(c)</span><p><span class="cl">Answer:</span> A Kohen did not do Yetzikah, rather, a Yisrael did.</p></div>
<div class="indent1"><span class="nm">(d)</span><p><span class="cl">Question:</span> If so, we should say similarly about Belilah, that a Kohen did not do Belilah, rather, a Yisrael did;</p></div>
<div class="indent2"><span class="nm">1.</span><p><span class="cl">Inference:</span> If Belilah was not done at all, it is Pasul.</p></div>
<div class="bbbline">18b----------------------------------------18b</p></div>
<div class="indent2"><span class="nm">2.</span><p><span class="cl">Rejection (Mishnah):</span> A Minchah of up to 60 Esronim of flour (may be brought in one Kli, for it) can be mixed with the oil, but 61 Esronim cannot (for only one Log of oil is put in a Kli. Some explain that even though one Log is put for each Isaron, there is not room to mix 61.)</p></div>
<div class="indent3"><span class="nm">i.</span><p><span class="cl">Question:</span> Why does it matter whether or not it can be mixed? Our Mishnah teaches that even if Belilah was not done, it is Kosher!</p></div>
<div class="indent3"><span class="nm">ii.</span><p><span class="cl">Answer (R. Zeira):</span> If a Minchah could have been mixed, mixing is not Me'akev. If it could not have been mixed, (e.g. it is too big), mixing is Me'akev (i.e. it is Pasul).</p></div>
<div class="indent1"><span class="nm">(e)</span><p><span class="cl">Answer:</span> Belilah need not be like Yetzikah!</p></div>
<div class="indent2"><span class="nm">1.</span><p>Yetzikah was done by a Zar, and not by a Kohen. Belilah was not done at all.</p></div>
<div class="indent1"><span class="nm">(f)</span><p><span class="cl">(Mishnah):</span> If it was broken into pieces Merubos...</p></div>
<div class="indent1"><span class="nm">(g)</span><p><span class="cl">Question:</span> The Mishnah taught that if Petisah was not done at all, it is Kosher. All the more so (it is Kosher if partial Petisah was done, i.e.) if it was broken into big pieces!</p></div>
<div class="indent1"><span class="nm">(h)</span><p><span class="cl">Answer #1:</span> Pieces Merubos means many pieces. (Even though they are too small, it is Kosher.)</p></div>
<div class="indent1"><span class="nm">(i)</span><p><span class="cl">Answer #2:</span> Really, it was broken into big pieces;</p></div>
<div class="indent2"><span class="nm">1.</span><p>One might have thought that when Petisah was not done at all (except for Kemitzah), it is Kosher, for the loaves are (virtually) whole, but if it was broken into big pieces, we do not have whole loaves nor proper Petitim (pieces), so it is Pasul. The Mishnah teaches that this is not so.</p></div>
<div class="indent1"><span class="nm">(j)</span><p><span class="cl">Suggestion:</span> If a Zar did Yetzikah, our Mishnah is Machshir. This is unlike R. Shimon!</p></div>
<div class="indent2"><span class="nm">1.</span><p><span class="cl">(Beraisa - R. Shimon):</span> If a Kohen denies that Hash-m commanded about the Avodah, he gets no share in Kehunah - "ha'Makriv... Lo Tihyeh... l'Manah."</p></div>
<div class="indent2"><span class="nm">2.</span><p><span class="cl">Question:</span> This only teaches that he must admit to Holachah. What is the source that he must admit to the other 15 Avodos, namely Yetzikah (putting oil on a Minchah), Belilah, Petisah, salting, Tenufah, bringing close to the Mizbe'ach, Kemitzah, Haktarah, Melikah, Kabalah, sprinkling blood, giving a Sotah to drink, Eglah Arufah, Taharah of a Metzora, and giving Birkas Kohanim in and outside the Mikdash?</p></div>
<div class="indent2"><span class="nm">3.</span><p><span class="cl">Answer:</span> "Mi'Bnei Aharon" - if a Kohen does not admit to all the Avodos of Kohanim, he has no share in Kehunah.</p></div>
<div class="indent1"><span class="nm">(k)</span><p><span class="cl">Version #1 - Rejection (Rav Nachman):</span> It is even like R. Shimon. Our Mishnah discusses Minchas Yisrael. The Beraisa discusses Minchas Kohanim;</p></div>
<div class="indent2"><span class="nm">1.</span><p>Minchas Yisrael requires Kemitzah. The Torah teaches that only after Kemitzah, Kohanim must do the Avodah;</p></div>
<div class="indent2"><span class="nm">2.</span><p>Minchas Kohanim does not require Kemitzah. Kohanim must do the Avodah from the beginning.</p></div>
<div class="indent1"><span class="nm">(l)</span><p><span class="cl">Objection (Rava):</span> We learn that Minchas Kohanim needs Yetzikah from Minchas Yisrael. We should say, just like Yetzikah of a Zar is Kosher for Minchas Yisrael, also for Minchas Kohanim!</p></div>
<div class="indent1"><span class="nm">(m)</span><p><span class="cl">Version #2 - Rejection (Rav Nachman):</span> It is even like R. Shimon. Our Mishnah discusses Menachos that require Kemitzah. The Beraisa discusses Menachos that do not;</p></div>
<div class="indent2"><span class="nm">1.</span><p>In Menachos that require Kemitzah, the Torah teaches that only after Kemitzah, Kohanim must do the Avodah;</p></div>
<div class="indent2"><span class="nm">2.</span><p>In Menachos that do not require Kemitzah, Kohanim must do the Avodah from the beginning.</p></div>
<div class="indent1"><span class="nm">(n)</span><p><span class="cl">Objection (Rava):</span> We learn Yetzikah in Menachos that do not require Kemitzah from Menachos that require it. We should say that just like Yetzikah of a Zar is Kosher for the latter, also for the former! (End of Version #2)</p></div>
<div class="indent1"><span class="nm">(o)</span><p><span class="cl">Affirmation:</span> Indeed, our Mishnah is unlike R. Shimon.</p></div>
