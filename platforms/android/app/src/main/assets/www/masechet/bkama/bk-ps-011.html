<p class="bas subject"><span class="nm">1)</span>LOSS IN VALUE OF THE CARCASS</p>
<p class="bas indent1"><span class="nm">(a)</span><span class="cl">Suggestion:</span> Tana'im argue about who suffers loss in value of the carcass.</p>
<p class="bas indent2"><span class="nm">1.</span><span class="cl">(Beraisa):</span> "(The Shomer) will bring Ed" - he brings Edim (witnesses) that it became Tereifah through Ones (beyond his control) to exempt himself;</p>
<p class="bas indent2"><span class="nm">2.</span>Aba Sha'ul says, he brings Edudah (the carcass) to Beis Din.</p>
<p class="bas indent2"><span class="nm">3.</span><span class="cl">Suggestion:</span> The first Tana holds that the victim suffers regarding loss in value of the carcass; Aba Sha'ul holds that the damager suffers the loss.</p>
<p class="bas indent1"><span class="nm">(b)</span><span class="cl">Rejection:</span> All agree that the victim suffers the loss. They argue about who must toil to retrieve it.</p>
<p class="bas indent1"><span class="nm">(c)</span><span class="cl">Support (Beraisa - Others):</span> "He will return money to the owner, and the carcass" teaches that the owner of the pit must take the carcass out of the pit.</p>
<p class="bas indent1"><span class="nm">(d)</span><span class="cl">Question (Abaye):</span> What is the case of toil to retrieve it?</p>
<p class="bas indent2"><span class="nm">1.</span>If it is worth one Zuz in the pit, and four Zuz on the edge of the pit, the pit owner toils for his profit!</p>
<p class="bas indent1"><span class="nm">(e)</span><span class="cl">Answer (Rava):</span> The case is, it is worth one Zuz in the pit, and also on the edge of the pit.</p>
<p class="bas indent1"><span class="nm">(f)</span><span class="cl">Question:</span> Is that ever the case?</p>
<p class="bas indent1"><span class="nm">(g)</span><span class="cl">Answer:</span> Yes! This is like people say, a beam is worth one Zuz in the city, and the same as in the wilderness.</p>
<p class="bas subject"><span class="nm">2)</span>FOR WHOM DO WE EVALUATE (THE VALUE OF THE CARCASS)?</p>
<p class="bas indent1"><span class="nm">(a)</span><span class="cl">(Shmuel):</span> We do not evaluate (the value of the carcass towards the required payment) for thieves or robbers, only for damagers. My father and I say, even for a borrower.</p>
<p class="bas indent1"><span class="nm">(b)</span><span class="cl">Question:</span> Does he mean, even for a borrower we do evaluate, or we do not?</p>
<p class="bas indent1"><span class="nm">(c)</span><span class="cl">Answer:</span> A man borrowed an axe and broke it. Rav obligated him to pay the full value of an axe.</p>
<p class="bas indent2"><span class="nm">1.</span>This shows that we do not evaluate for borrowers.</p>
<p class="bas indent1"><span class="nm">(d)</span><span class="cl">Rejection:</span> To the contrary! Rav Kahana and Rav Asi asked Rav if that was really the law, and Rav was silent!</p>
<p class="bas indent2"><span class="nm">1.</span>This shows that we do evaluate for borrowers!</p>
<p class="bas indent1"><span class="nm">(e)</span><span class="cl">(Ula):</span> We evaluate for thieves or robbers.</p>
<p class="bas indent1"><span class="nm">(f)</span><span class="cl">(Rav Papi):</span> We do not evaluate for them.</p>
<p class="bas indent1"><span class="nm">(g)</span>The Halachah is, we do not evaluate for them, but we do evaluate for a borrower, like Rav Kahana and Rav Asi.</p>
<p class="bas subject"><span class="nm">3)</span>OTHER TEACHINGS OF ULA (FROM R. ELAZAR)</p>
<p class="bas indent1"><span class="nm">(a)</span><span class="cl">(Ula):</span> If a fetal sac that partially left the womb on Sunday, and part came out on Monday, the days of Tum'ah (of childbirth) start from Sunday.</p>
<p class="bas indent1"><span class="nm">(b)</span><span class="cl">Question (Rava):</span> Are you being stringent? This stringency will lead to a leniency, for she will consider herself to be Tehorah two weeks from Sunday!</p>
<p class="bas indent1"><span class="nm">(c)</span><span class="cl">(Rava):</span> Rather, she is concerned lest she became Teme'ah on Sunday, but she counts days of Tum'ah only from Monday.</p>
<p class="bas indent1"><span class="nm">(d)</span><span class="cl">Question:</span> Ula teaches that (even) part of a fetal sac always contains (part of) a child. A Mishnah teaches this!</p>
<p class="bas indent2"><span class="nm">1.</span><span class="cl">(Mishnah):</span> If a fetal sac (of an animal) partially left the womb, one may not eat it;</p>
<p class="bas indent2"><span class="nm">2.</span>What is a sign (that there was) a child in a woman, is also a sign in an animal.</p>
<p class="bas indent1"><span class="nm">(e)</span><span class="cl">Answer:</span> From the Mishnah, one might have thought that a fetal sac does not always contain a child. The Mishnah decrees when part of the sac left due to when the entire sac left. Ula teaches that this is not so.</p>
<p class="bas bbbline">11b----------------------------------------11b</p>
<p class="bas indent1"><span class="nm">(f)</span><span class="cl">(Ula):</span> If a firstborn boy became Tereifah within 30 days, we do not redeem him.</p>
<p class="bas indent1"><span class="nm">(g)</span><span class="cl">(Rami bar Chama) Suggestion:</span> Perhaps "you will surely redeem (a firstborn son)" applies even if he became Tereifah within 30 days!</p>
<p class="bas indent1"><span class="nm">(h)</span><span class="cl">Rejection:</span> "Only" teaches that you do not.</p>
<p class="bas indent1"><span class="nm">(i)</span><span class="cl">(Ula):</span> A large (i.e. work) animal is acquired through Meshichah (taking to one's domain).</p>
<p class="bas indent1"><span class="nm">(j)</span><span class="cl">Question (Mishnah):</span> It is acquired through Mesirah (handing over).</p>
<p class="bas indent1"><span class="nm">(k)</span><span class="cl">Answer:</span> Ula holds like the following Tana.</p>
<p class="bas indent2"><span class="nm">1.</span><span class="cl">(Beraisa):</span> Chachamim say, both large and small animals are acquired through Meshichah;</p>
<p class="bas indent2"><span class="nm">2.</span>R. Shimon says, both are acquired through lifting them.</p>
<p class="bas indent1"><span class="nm">(l)</span><span class="cl">(Ula):</span> If brothers split an inheritance, we evaluate the value of the clothes each brother is wearing (it is as part of his share), but not what his children are wearing.</p>
<p class="bas indent1"><span class="nm">(m)</span><span class="cl">(Rav Papa):</span> Sometimes, we don't even evaluate what a brother is wearing, such as an eldest brother (who pleads on behalf of his brothers). They want that he be dressed nicely, so his words will be heeded!</p>
<p class="bas indent1"><span class="nm">(n)</span><span class="cl">(Ula):</span> If a Shomer handed over (what was given to him) to another Shomer, he is exempt;</p>
<p class="bas indent2"><span class="nm">1.</span>Not only a Shomer Chinam who gave to a Shomer Sachar, who elevated the level of guarding, is exempt. Rather, even a Shomer Sachar who gave to a Shomer Chinam, who lowered the level of guarding, is exempt, for he gave it to one with understanding.</p>
<p class="bas indent1"><span class="nm">(o)</span><span class="cl">(Rava):</span> If a Shomer handed over to another Shomer, he is liable;</p>
<p class="bas indent2"><span class="nm">1.</span>Not only a Shomer Sachar who gave to a Shomer Chinam, who lowered the level of guarding, is liable, for he lowered the level of guarding. Rather, even a Shomer Chinam who gave to a Shomer Sachar, who raised the level of guarding, is liable, for the depositor can say that he doesn't trust the oath of the second Shomer.</p>
<p class="bas indent1"><span class="nm">(p)</span><span class="cl">(Ula citing R. Elazar):</span> The law is, we collect debts from slaves.</p>
<p class="bas indent1"><span class="nm">(q)</span><span class="cl">Question (Rav Nachman):</span> Did R. Elazar say that we collect slaves even from orphans?</p>
<p class="bas indent1"><span class="nm">(r)</span><span class="cl">Answer (Ula):</span> No, we collect only from the borrower himself.</p>
<p class="bas indent1"><span class="nm">(s)</span><span class="cl">Question:</span> That is no Chidush. We collect even the shirt that a borrower is wearing!</p>
<p class="bas indent1"><span class="nm">(t)</span><span class="cl">Answer:</span> The case is, the slave was made an Aputiki (special collateral to pay the loan. It is collected even if it was sold):</p>
<p class="bas indent2"><span class="nm">1.</span><span class="cl">(Rava):</span> If one made his slave an Aputiki and sold him, a creditor collects the slave;</p>
<p class="bas indent2"><span class="nm">2.</span>If one made his ox an Aputiki and sold it, a creditor does not collect it.</p>
<p class="bas indent2"><span class="nm">3.</span><span class="cl">Question:</span> What is the difference between them?</p>
<p class="bas indent2"><span class="nm">4.</span><span class="cl">Answer:</span> People hear about making a slave an Aputiki, but not about making an ox an Aputiki. (It is unfair that one who bought an ox lose it, for he did not knew about the Aputiki.)</p>
