<div class="subject"><span class="nm">1)</span><p>WHICH MUMIM NECESSITATE DIVORCE</p></div>
<div class="indent1"><span class="nm">(a)</span><p><span class="cl">(Mishnah):</span> Chachamim say that this applies only to Mumim in hidden places.</p></div>
<div class="indent1"><span class="nm">(b)</span><p><span class="cl">(Rav Nachman):</span> If a woman has epileptic fits, this is considered a hidden Mum.</p></div>
<div class="indent2"><span class="nm">1.</span><p>This is if it comes at fixed times (she is careful to be secluded at these times). If not, it is like an exposed Mum.</p></div>
<div class="indent1"><span class="nm">(c)</span><p><span class="cl">(Mishnah):</span> If Mumim arose in a man, we do not force him to divorce his wife;</p></div>
<div class="indent1"><span class="nm">(d)</span><p>R. Shimon ben Gamliel says, this applies to small Mumim. Regarding big Mumim, we force him to divorce her.</p></div>
<div class="indent1"><span class="nm">(e)</span><p><span class="cl">(Gemara - Rav Yehudah):</span> The Mishnah says 'arose';</p></div>
<div class="indent1"><span class="nm">(f)</span><p><span class="cl">(Chiya bar Rav):</span> The text says 'were'.</p></div>
<div class="indent2"><span class="nm">1.</span><p>The opinion that says 'arose' holds that all the more so if the Mum was there (he need not divorce her), for she saw the Mum and accepted it;</p></div>
<div class="indent2"><span class="nm">2.</span><p>The opinion that says 'were', would say that we force him to divorced if Mumim arose</p></div>
<div class="indent1"><span class="nm">(g)</span><p><span class="cl">Question (Mishnah - R. Shimon ben Gamliel):</span> This applies to small Mumim. Regarding big Mumim, we force him to divorce her.</p></div>
<div class="indent2"><span class="nm">1.</span><p>We understand this according to the text 'arose'.</p></div>
<div class="indent2"><span class="nm">2.</span><p>But according to the text 'were', what difference does it make if they are small or big? She saw them and accepted them!</p></div>
<div class="indent1"><span class="nm">(h)</span><p><span class="cl">Answer:</span> She thought she could bear them. Now she sees that she cannot bear them.</p></div>
<div class="indent1"><span class="nm">(i)</span><p><span class="cl">(R. Shimon ben Gamliel):</span> The following are big Mumim: his eye was blinded, his arm was cut off, or his leg was broken. (Bach - this is a Mishnah. It seems that the Rif and Rosh agree.)</p></div>
<div class="indent1"><span class="nm">(j)</span><p><span class="cl">(R. Aba bar Yakov, citing R. Yochanan):</span> The Halachah follows R. Shimon ben Gamliel.</p></div>
<div class="indent1"><span class="nm">(k)</span><p><span class="cl">(Rava):</span> The Halachah follows Chachamim.</p></div>
<div class="indent1"><span class="nm">(l)</span><p><span class="cl">Question:</span> Did R. Yochanan really (need to) say that (here) the Halachah follows R. Shimon ben Gamliel?!</p></div>
<div class="indent2"><span class="nm">1.</span><p><span class="cl">(Rabah bar bar Chanah, citing R. Yochanan):</span> The Halachah always follows R. Shimon ben Gamliel in the Mishnayos, except for three places: a co-signer, the case in Tzidon, and bringing a later proof.</p></div>
<div class="indent1"><span class="nm">(m)</span><p><span class="cl">Answer:</span> R. Aba and Rabah argue about what R. Yochanan said.</p></div>
<div class="subject"><span class="nm">2)</span><p>MAJOR MUMIM</p></div>
<div class="indent1"><span class="nm">(a)</span><p><span class="cl">(Mishnah):</span> If a husband has any of the following Mumim or occupations, we force him to divorce his wife: leprosy, Pulipus, a Mekametz, a Metzaref of copper (these will be explained), or a tanner, whether these preceded the marriage or came during the marriage;</p></div>
<div class="indent2"><span class="nm">1.</span><p>R. Meir says, regarding all of them, even if he stipulated with her she can say 'I thought that I could bear it, but now I see that I cannot.'</p></div>
<div class="indent2"><span class="nm">2.</span><p>Chachamim say that she must bear it, except for a leper, for this harms her.</p></div>
<div class="indent1"><span class="nm">(b)</span><p>A case occurred in Tzidon and a tanner's wife fell to Yibum to a tanner. Chachamim said that she can claim 'I could bear your brother, but not you.'</p></div>
<div class="indent1"><span class="nm">(c)</span><p><span class="cl">(Gemara) Question:</span> What is Pulipus?</p></div>
<div class="indent1"><span class="nm">(d)</span><p><span class="cl">Answer #1 (Shmuel):</span> It is a smell that comes from the nose.</p></div>
<div class="indent1"><span class="nm">(e)</span><p><span class="cl">Answer #2 (Beraisa):</span> It is a smell that comes from the mouth.</p></div>
<div class="indent2"><span class="nm">1.</span><p>Rav Asi switched the opinions, and gave a Siman to remember who said which: 'Shmuel's mouth has not ceased in this entire Perek.'</p></div>
<div class="indent1"><span class="nm">(f)</span><p><span class="cl">Question:</span> What is a Mekametz?</p></div>
<div class="indent1"><span class="nm">(g)</span><p><span class="cl">Answer (Rav Yehudah):</span> It is one who gathers dung of dogs.</p></div>
<div class="indent1"><span class="nm">(h)</span><p><span class="cl">Question (Beraisa):</span> A Mekametz is a tanner.</p></div>
<div class="indent2"><span class="nm">1.</span><p><span class="cl">Counter-question:</span> The Mishnah lists both a Mekametz and a Borsi (a tanner)!</p></div>
<div class="indent2"><span class="nm">2.</span><p><span class="cl">Answer:</span> A Mekametz is one who tans few hides. A Borsi is a large-scale tanner!</p></div>
<div class="indent2"><span class="nm">3.</span><p>The question from the Beraisa remains difficult for Rav Yehudah.</p></div>
<div class="indent1"><span class="nm">(i)</span><p><span class="cl">Answer:</span> Tana'im argue about the meaning of a Mekametz.</p></div>
<div class="indent2"><span class="nm">1.</span><p><span class="cl">(Beraisa):</span> A Mekametz is a tanner;</p></div>
<div class="indent2"><span class="nm">2.</span><p>Some say that it is one who gathers dung of dogs.</p></div>
<div class="indent1"><span class="nm">(j)</span><p><span class="cl">Question:</span> What is a Metzaref of copper?</p></div>
<div class="indent1"><span class="nm">(k)</span><p><span class="cl">Answer #1 (Rav Ashi):</span> It is one who smelts it and makes pots.</p></div>
<div class="indent1"><span class="nm">(l)</span><p><span class="cl">Answer #2 (Rabah bar bar Chanah):</span> It is one who quarries it from its source.</p></div>
<div class="indent1"><span class="nm">(m)</span><p><span class="cl">Support (Beraisa):</span> A Metzaref is one who quarries copper from its source.</p></div>
<div class="subject"><span class="nm">3)</span><p>WHOM WE FORCE TO DIVORCE HIS WIFE</p></div>
<div class="indent1"><span class="nm">(a)</span><p><span class="cl">(Rav):</span> If one says 'I will not feed or support my wife', we force him to divorce her and pay her Kesuvah.</p></div>
<div class="indent1"><span class="nm">(b)</span><p>R. Elazar said this in front of Shmuel.</p></div>
<div class="indent1"><span class="nm">(c)</span><p><span class="cl">Shmuel:</span> Feed to Elazar barley (like an animal)! Rather than forcing the husband to divorce her, force him to feed her!</p></div>
<div class="indent2"><span class="nm">1.</span><p>Rav holds that a person cannot live with a snake in one basket. (We do not force her to live with an antagonizing husband.)</p></div>
<div class="indent1"><span class="nm">(d)</span><p>R. Binyamin bar Yefet said in the name of R. Yochanan like Rav.</p></div>
<div class="indent1"><span class="nm">(e)</span><p><span class="cl">R. Zeira:</span> R. Elazar was fed barley for teaching thusly!</p></div>
<div class="indent1"><span class="nm">(f)</span><p><span class="cl">(Rav Yehudah, citing Rav Asi):</span> We force a husband to divorce his wife only if she is forbidden to him.</p></div>
<div class="indent1"><span class="nm">(g)</span><p><span class="cl">(Rav Yehudah citing Shmuel):</span> This applies in cases such as a widow married to a Kohen Gadol, a divorcee or Chalutzah to a regular Kohen, a Mamzeres or Nesinah to a Yisrael, or a Bas Yisrael to a Nasin or Mamzer. We do not force a man who has been married for 10 years without children.</p></div>
<div class="indent1"><span class="nm">(h)</span><p><span class="cl">(Rav Tachlifa citing Shmuel):</span> We force even a man who has been married for 10 years without children.</p></div>
<div class="indent1"><span class="nm">(i)</span><p><span class="cl">(Mishnah):</span> If a husband has any of the following Mumim, we force him to divorce his wife: leprosy, Pulipus...</p></div>
<div class="indent1"><span class="nm">(j)</span><p>This is not difficult for Rav Asi. He can say that the Mishnah lists only cases when mid'Rabanan we force him to divorce her, not when mid'Oraisa he must divorce her.</p></div>
<div class="indent1"><span class="nm">(k)</span><p><span class="cl">Question:</span> According to Rav Tachlifa, the Mishnah should have listed a man who has been married for 10 years without children!</p></div>
<div class="indent1"><span class="nm">(l)</span><p><span class="cl">Answer #1 (Rav Nachman):</span> The Mishnah discusses cases when we force with lashes. If a man has been married for 10 years without children, we force only with words.</p></div>
<div class="indent1"><span class="nm">(m)</span><p><span class="cl">Objection (R. Aba):</span> "A slave will not fix his ways due to words!"</p></div>
<div class="indent1"><span class="nm">(n)</span><p><span class="cl">Answer #2 (R. Aba):</span> In both cases we force with lashes. In our Mishnah, we do not force if she wants to stay with him. We force a childless man in any case.</p></div>
<div class="bbbline">77b----------------------------------------77b</p></div>
<div class="indent1"><span class="nm">(o)</span><p><span class="cl">Objection:</span> The Mishnah lists a leper, even though we do not allow her to stay with him!</p></div>
<div class="indent2"><span class="nm">1.</span><p><span class="cl">(Mishnah - Chachamim):</span> (She must bear him,) except for a leper, since this harms him.</p></div>
<div class="indent1"><span class="nm">(p)</span><p><span class="cl">Answer:</span> Regarding a leper, if she wants to remain with him with witnesses (who will ensure that they do not have Bi'ah), we allow her. We do not allow a childless man to keep his wife even with witnesses.</p></div>
<div class="subject"><span class="nm">4)</span><p>LEPROSY</p></div>
<div class="indent1"><span class="nm">(a)</span><p><span class="cl">(Beraisa - R. Yosi):</span> There are 24 types of leprosy. For all of them, Bi'ah is harmful. The worst is Ba'alei Ra'asan (there is a Sheretz in the brain).</p></div>
<div class="indent1"><span class="nm">(b)</span><p><span class="cl">Question:</span> What causes it?</p></div>
<div class="indent1"><span class="nm">(c)</span><p><span class="cl">Answer (Beraisa):</span> If one has Bi'ah after bloodletting, the children will be weak. If they have Bi'ah after both let blood, the children will be Ba'alei Ra'asan.</p></div>
<div class="indent2"><span class="nm">1.</span><p><span class="cl">(Rav Papa):</span> This applies only if they did not eat in between. If they ate in between, there is no problem.</p></div>
<div class="indent1"><span class="nm">(d)</span><p><span class="cl">The signs of Ba'alei Ra'asan are:</span> his eyes tear, his nose drips, saliva comes from his mouth, and flies hover about him.</p></div>
<div class="indent1"><span class="nm">(e)</span><p><span class="cl">Question:</span> What is the cure?</p></div>
<div class="indent1"><span class="nm">(f)</span><p><span class="cl">Answer (Abaye):</span> Take mint, alum, bark of a nut tree, shearings of leather, lily, and red date-shells, and cook them together. Bring the sick one into a marble house, or whose walls are seven and a half bricks thick. Pour 300 cups of the potion on his head, until his skull softens. Cut the skull; put a myrtle leaf under each leg of the Sheretz, and remove it with tongs; burn the insect.</p></div>
<div class="indent2"><span class="nm">1.</span><p>If you do not burn it, it will return to him.</p></div>
<div class="indent1"><span class="nm">(g)</span><p>R. Yochanan warned people to beware of the flies from Ba'alei Ra'asan. R. Zeira would not sit downwind from them. R. Elazar would not enter the same tent as them. R. Ami and R. Asi would not eat eggs from an alley with Ba'alei Ra'asan.</p></div>
<div class="indent1"><span class="nm">(h)</span><p>R. Yehoshua ben Levi would cling to them and engage in Torah.</p></div>
<div class="indent2"><span class="nm">1.</span><p>"And it (Torah) gives grace (to those who learn it)" - all the more so, it protects them!</p></div>
<div class="subject"><span class="nm">5)</span><p>R. YEHOSHUA BEN LEVI'S JOURNEY TO GAN EDEN</p></div>
<div class="indent1"><span class="nm">(a)</span><p>When R. Yehoshua ben Levi was about to die, the Satan (angel of death) was told to accede to his desires. The Satan appeared to him.</p></div>
<div class="indent1"><span class="nm">(b)</span><p>R. Yehoshua ben Levi asked to see where his place will be (in Gan Eden). The Satan consented.</p></div>
<div class="indent1"><span class="nm">(c)</span><p>R. Yehoshua ben Levi asked for the Satan's knife, lest it scare him on the way; he gave it to him.</p></div>
<div class="indent1"><span class="nm">(d)</span><p>When they got there, the Satan lifted him up and showed him. R. Yehoshua ben Levi jumped to the other side, held onto his garment and swore that he will not leave.</p></div>

<div class="indent3"><span class="nm">i.</span><p>Really, the rainbow was not seen in his day. R. Yehoshua ben Levi did not want to take credit for this.</p></div>
<div class="indent1"><span class="nm">(h)</span><p>R. Chanina bar Papa was the Satan's close friend. When he was about to die, the Satan was told to accede to his desires; he appeared to him.</p></div>

<div class="indent2"><span class="nm">4.</span><p>Even though he had not, when he died, a pillar of fire separated him from everyone else.	This happens for only one or two in a generation.</p></div>
<div class="indent1"><span class="nm">(l)</span><p>R. Alexandri came close and asked (that the fire cease) for the honor of Chachamim. The fire continued. He asked 'for the honor of your father'; the fire continued. He asked 'for your own honor'; the fire abated.</p></div>
