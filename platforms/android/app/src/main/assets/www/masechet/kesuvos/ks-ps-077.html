<p class="bas subject"><span class="nm">1)</span>WHICH <i>MUMIM</i> NECESSITATE DIVORCE</p>
<p class="bas indent1"><span class="nm">(a)</span><span class="cl">(Mishnah):</span> Chachamim say that this applies only to Mumim in hidden places.</p>
<p class="bas indent1"><span class="nm">(b)</span><span class="cl">(Rav Nachman):</span> If a woman has epileptic fits, this is considered a hidden Mum.</p>
<p class="bas indent2"><span class="nm">1.</span>This is if it comes at fixed times (she is careful to be secluded at these times). If not, it is like an exposed Mum.</p>
<p class="bas indent1"><span class="nm">(c)</span><span class="cl">(Mishnah):</span> If Mumim arose in a man, we do not force him to divorce his wife;</p>
<p class="bas indent1"><span class="nm">(d)</span>R. Shimon ben Gamliel says, this applies to small Mumim. Regarding big Mumim, we force him to divorce her.</p>
<p class="bas indent1"><span class="nm">(e)</span><span class="cl">(Gemara - Rav Yehudah):</span> The Mishnah says 'arose';</p>
<p class="bas indent1"><span class="nm">(f)</span><span class="cl">(Chiya bar Rav):</span> The text says 'were'.</p>
<p class="bas indent2"><span class="nm">1.</span>The opinion that says 'arose' holds that all the more so if the Mum was there (he need not divorce her), for she saw the Mum and accepted it;</p>
<p class="bas indent2"><span class="nm">2.</span>The opinion that says 'were', would say that we force him to divorced if Mumim arose</p>
<p class="bas indent1"><span class="nm">(g)</span><span class="cl">Question (Mishnah - R. Shimon ben Gamliel):</span> This applies to small Mumim. Regarding big Mumim, we force him to divorce her.</p>
<p class="bas indent2"><span class="nm">1.</span>We understand this according to the text 'arose'.</p>
<p class="bas indent2"><span class="nm">2.</span>But according to the text 'were', what difference does it make if they are small or big? She saw them and accepted them!</p>
<p class="bas indent1"><span class="nm">(h)</span><span class="cl">Answer:</span> She thought she could bear them. Now she sees that she cannot bear them.</p>
<p class="bas indent1"><span class="nm">(i)</span><span class="cl">(R. Shimon ben Gamliel):</span> The following are big Mumim: his eye was blinded, his arm was cut off, or his leg was broken. (Bach - this is a Mishnah. It seems that the Rif and Rosh agree.)</p>
<p class="bas indent1"><span class="nm">(j)</span><span class="cl">(R. Aba bar Yakov, citing R. Yochanan):</span> The Halachah follows R. Shimon ben Gamliel.</p>
<p class="bas indent1"><span class="nm">(k)</span><span class="cl">(Rava):</span> The Halachah follows Chachamim.</p>
<p class="bas indent1"><span class="nm">(l)</span><span class="cl">Question:</span> Did R. Yochanan really (need to) say that (here) the Halachah follows R. Shimon ben Gamliel?!</p>
<p class="bas indent2"><span class="nm">1.</span><span class="cl">(Rabah bar bar Chanah, citing R. Yochanan):</span> The Halachah always follows R. Shimon ben Gamliel in the Mishnayos, except for three places: a co-signer, the case in Tzidon, and bringing a later proof.</p>
<p class="bas indent1"><span class="nm">(m)</span><span class="cl">Answer:</span> R. Aba and Rabah argue about what R. Yochanan said.</p>
<p class="bas subject"><span class="nm">2)</span>MAJOR <i>MUMIM</i></p>
<p class="bas indent1"><span class="nm">(a)</span><span class="cl">(Mishnah):</span> If a husband has any of the following Mumim or occupations, we force him to divorce his wife: leprosy, Pulipus, a Mekametz, a Metzaref of copper (these will be explained), or a tanner, whether these preceded the marriage or came during the marriage;</p>
<p class="bas indent2"><span class="nm">1.</span>R. Meir says, regarding all of them, even if he stipulated with her she can say 'I thought that I could bear it, but now I see that I cannot.'</p>
<p class="bas indent2"><span class="nm">2.</span>Chachamim say that she must bear it, except for a leper, for this harms her.</p>
<p class="bas indent1"><span class="nm">(b)</span>A case occurred in Tzidon and a tanner's wife fell to Yibum to a tanner. Chachamim said that she can claim 'I could bear your brother, but not you.'</p>
<p class="bas indent1"><span class="nm">(c)</span><span class="cl">(Gemara) Question:</span> What is Pulipus?</p>
<p class="bas indent1"><span class="nm">(d)</span><span class="cl">Answer #1 (Shmuel):</span> It is a smell that comes from the nose.</p>
<p class="bas indent1"><span class="nm">(e)</span><span class="cl">Answer #2 (Beraisa):</span> It is a smell that comes from the mouth.</p>
<p class="bas indent2"><span class="nm">1.</span><span class="cl">Rav Asi switched the opinions, and gave a Siman to remember who said which:</span> 'Shmuel's mouth has not ceased in this entire Perek.'</p>
<p class="bas indent1"><span class="nm">(f)</span><span class="cl">Question:</span> What is a Mekametz?</p>
<p class="bas indent1"><span class="nm">(g)</span><span class="cl">Answer (Rav Yehudah):</span> It is one who gathers dung of dogs.</p>
<p class="bas indent1"><span class="nm">(h)</span><span class="cl">Question (Beraisa):</span> A Mekametz is a tanner.</p>
<p class="bas indent2"><span class="nm">1.</span><span class="cl">Counter-question:</span> The Mishnah lists both a Mekametz and a Borsi (a tanner)!</p>
<p class="bas indent2"><span class="nm">2.</span><span class="cl">Answer:</span> A Mekametz is one who tans few hides. A Borsi is a large-scale tanner!</p>
<p class="bas indent2"><span class="nm">3.</span>The question from the Beraisa remains difficult for Rav Yehudah.</p>
<p class="bas indent1"><span class="nm">(i)</span><span class="cl">Answer:</span> Tana'im argue about the meaning of a Mekametz.</p>
<p class="bas indent2"><span class="nm">1.</span><span class="cl">(Beraisa):</span> A Mekametz is a tanner;</p>
<p class="bas indent2"><span class="nm">2.</span>Some say that it is one who gathers dung of dogs.</p>
<p class="bas indent1"><span class="nm">(j)</span><span class="cl">Question:</span> What is a Metzaref of copper?</p>
<p class="bas indent1"><span class="nm">(k)</span><span class="cl">Answer #1 (Rav Ashi):</span> It is one who smelts it and makes pots.</p>
<p class="bas indent1"><span class="nm">(l)</span><span class="cl">Answer #2 (Rabah bar bar Chanah):</span> It is one who quarries it from its source.</p>
<p class="bas indent1"><span class="nm">(m)</span><span class="cl">Support (Beraisa):</span> A Metzaref is one who quarries copper from its source.</p>
<p class="bas subject"><span class="nm">3)</span>WHOM WE FORCE TO DIVORCE HIS WIFE</p>
<p class="bas indent1"><span class="nm">(a)</span><span class="cl">(Rav):</span> If one says 'I will not feed or support my wife', we force him to divorce her and pay her Kesuvah.</p>
<p class="bas indent1"><span class="nm">(b)</span>R. Elazar said this in front of Shmuel.</p>
<p class="bas indent1"><span class="nm">(c)</span><span class="cl">Shmuel:</span> Feed to Elazar barley (like an animal)! Rather than forcing the husband to divorce her, force him to feed her!</p>
<p class="bas indent2"><span class="nm">1.</span>Rav holds that a person cannot live with a snake in one basket. (We do not force her to live with an antagonizing husband.)</p>
<p class="bas indent1"><span class="nm">(d)</span>R. Binyamin bar Yefet said in the name of R. Yochanan like Rav.</p>
<p class="bas indent1"><span class="nm">(e)</span><span class="cl">R. Zeira:</span> R. Elazar was fed barley for teaching thusly!</p>
<p class="bas indent1"><span class="nm">(f)</span><span class="cl">(Rav Yehudah, citing Rav Asi):</span> We force a husband to divorce his wife only if she is forbidden to him.</p>
<p class="bas indent1"><span class="nm">(g)</span><span class="cl">(Rav Yehudah citing Shmuel):</span> This applies in cases such as a widow married to a Kohen Gadol, a divorcee or Chalutzah to a regular Kohen, a Mamzeres or Nesinah to a Yisrael, or a Bas Yisrael to a Nasin or Mamzer. We do not force a man who has been married for 10 years without children.</p>
<p class="bas indent1"><span class="nm">(h)</span><span class="cl">(Rav Tachlifa citing Shmuel):</span> We force even a man who has been married for 10 years without children.</p>
<p class="bas indent1"><span class="nm">(i)</span><span class="cl">(Mishnah):</span> If a husband has any of the following Mumim, we force him to divorce his wife: leprosy, Pulipus...</p>
<p class="bas indent1"><span class="nm">(j)</span>This is not difficult for Rav Asi. He can say that the Mishnah lists only cases when mid'Rabanan we force him to divorce her, not when mid'Oraisa he must divorce her.</p>
<p class="bas indent1"><span class="nm">(k)</span><span class="cl">Question:</span> According to Rav Tachlifa, the Mishnah should have listed a man who has been married for 10 years without children!</p>
<p class="bas indent1"><span class="nm">(l)</span><span class="cl">Answer #1 (Rav Nachman):</span> The Mishnah discusses cases when we force with lashes. If a man has been married for 10 years without children, we force only with words.</p>
<p class="bas indent1"><span class="nm">(m)</span><span class="cl">Objection (R. Aba):</span> "A slave will not fix his ways due to words!"</p>
<p class="bas indent1"><span class="nm">(n)</span><span class="cl">Answer #2 (R. Aba):</span> In both cases we force with lashes. In our Mishnah, we do not force if she wants to stay with him. We force a childless man in any case.</p>
<p class="bas bbbline">77b----------------------------------------77b</p>
<p class="bas indent1"><span class="nm">(o)</span><span class="cl">Objection:</span> The Mishnah lists a leper, even though we do not allow her to stay with him!</p>
<p class="bas indent2"><span class="nm">1.</span><span class="cl">(Mishnah - Chachamim):</span> (She must bear him,) except for a leper, since this harms him.</p>
<p class="bas indent1"><span class="nm">(p)</span><span class="cl">Answer:</span> Regarding a leper, if she wants to remain with him with witnesses (who will ensure that they do not have Bi'ah), we allow her. We do not allow a childless man to keep his wife even with witnesses.</p>
<p class="bas subject"><span class="nm">4)</span>LEPROSY</p>
<p class="bas indent1"><span class="nm">(a)</span><span class="cl">(Beraisa - R. Yosi):</span> There are 24 types of leprosy. For all of them, Bi'ah is harmful. The worst is Ba'alei Ra'asan (there is a Sheretz in the brain).</p>
<p class="bas indent1"><span class="nm">(b)</span><span class="cl">Question:</span> What causes it?</p>
<p class="bas indent1"><span class="nm">(c)</span><span class="cl">Answer (Beraisa):</span> If one has Bi'ah after bloodletting, the children will be weak. If they have Bi'ah after both let blood, the children will be Ba'alei Ra'asan.</p>
<p class="bas indent2"><span class="nm">1.</span><span class="cl">(Rav Papa):</span> This applies only if they did not eat in between. If they ate in between, there is no problem.</p>
<p class="bas indent1"><span class="nm">(d)</span><span class="cl">The signs of Ba'alei Ra'asan are:</span> his eyes tear, his nose drips, saliva comes from his mouth, and flies hover about him.</p>
<p class="bas indent1"><span class="nm">(e)</span><span class="cl">Question:</span> What is the cure?</p>
<p class="bas indent1"><span class="nm">(f)</span><span class="cl">Answer (Abaye):</span> Take mint, alum, bark of a nut tree, shearings of leather, lily, and red date-shells, and cook them together. Bring the sick one into a marble house, or whose walls are seven and a half bricks thick. Pour 300 cups of the potion on his head, until his skull softens. Cut the skull; put a myrtle leaf under each leg of the Sheretz, and remove it with tongs; burn the insect.</p>
<p class="bas indent2"><span class="nm">1.</span>If you do not burn it, it will return to him.</p>
<p class="bas indent1"><span class="nm">(g)</span>R. Yochanan warned people to beware of the flies from Ba'alei Ra'asan. R. Zeira would not sit downwind from them. R. Elazar would not enter the same tent as them. R. Ami and R. Asi would not eat eggs from an alley with Ba'alei Ra'asan.</p>
<p class="bas indent1"><span class="nm">(h)</span>R. Yehoshua ben Levi would cling to them and engage in Torah.</p>
<p class="bas indent2"><span class="nm">1.</span>"And it (Torah) gives grace (to those who learn it)" - all the more so, it protects them!</p>
<p class="bas subject"><span class="nm">5)</span>R. YEHOSHUA BEN LEVI'S JOURNEY TO <i>GAN</i> <i>EDEN</i></p>
<p class="bas indent1"><span class="nm">(a)</span>When R. Yehoshua ben Levi was about to die, the Satan (angel of death) was told to accede to his desires. The Satan appeared to him.</p>
<p class="bas indent1"><span class="nm">(b)</span>R. Yehoshua ben Levi asked to see where his place will be (in Gan Eden). The Satan consented.</p>
<p class="bas indent1"><span class="nm">(c)</span>R. Yehoshua ben Levi asked for the Satan's knife, lest it scare him on the way; he gave it to him.</p>
<p class="bas indent1"><span class="nm">(d)</span>When they got there, the Satan lifted him up and showed him. R. Yehoshua ben Levi jumped to the other side, held onto his garment and swore that he will not leave.</p>
<p class="bas indent2"><span class="nm">1.</span><span class="cl">Hash-m:</span> If he ever annulled an oath, he will go back; if not, not. (He had not.)</p>
<p class="bas indent1"><span class="nm">(e)</span>The Satan asked him to return his knife. R. Yehoshua ben Levi refused.</p>
<p class="bas indent2"><span class="nm">1.</span><span class="cl">A voice from Heaven:</span> Return it, for it is needed for the world. (R. Yehoshua ben Levi returned it.)</p>
<p class="bas indent1"><span class="nm">(f)</span><span class="cl">Eliyahu:</span> Make room for the son of Levi! Make room for the son of Levi!</p>
<p class="bas indent1"><span class="nm">(g)</span>R. Yehoshua ben Levi found R. Shimon bar Yochai sitting on 13 gold chairs.</p>
<p class="bas indent2"><span class="nm">1.</span><span class="cl">R. Shimon bar Yochai:</span> Are you the son of Levi?</p>
<p class="bas indent2"><span class="nm">2.</span><span class="cl">R. Yehoshua ben Levi:</span> Yes.</p>

<p class="bas indent2"><span class="nm">5.</span><span class="cl">R. Shimon bar Yochai:</span> If so, you are not worthy of this proclamation. (The rainbow is Hash-m's sign not to destroy the world. Your merit did not suffice to protect the world!)</p>
<p class="bas indent3"><span class="nm">i.</span>Really, the rainbow was not seen in his day. R. Yehoshua ben Levi did not want to take credit for this.</p>
<p class="bas indent1"><span class="nm">(h)</span>R. Chanina bar Papa was the Satan's close friend. When he was about to die, the Satan was told to accede to his desires; he appeared to him.</p>
<p class="bas indent2"><span class="nm">1.</span><span class="cl">R. Chanina bar Papa:</span> Give me 30 days to review my learning. The angel of death agreed.</p>
<p class="bas indent3"><span class="nm">i.</span>Happy is the one who comes to the world to come and remembers his learning.</p>
<p class="bas indent1"><span class="nm">(i)</span>The Satan returned after 30 days.</p>
<p class="bas indent1"><span class="nm">(j)</span>R. Chanina bar Papa asked to see where his place will be. The Satan consented.</p>
<p class="bas indent1"><span class="nm">(k)</span>R. Chanina bar Papa asked for the Satan's knife, lest it scare him on the way</p>
<p class="bas indent2"><span class="nm">1.</span><span class="cl">The Satan:</span> Do you want to do to me as your friend did?!</p>
<p class="bas indent2"><span class="nm">2.</span><span class="cl">R. Chanina bar Papa:</span> Bring a Sefer Torah, and see if there is anything in it I didn't fulfill.</p>
<p class="bas indent2"><span class="nm">3.</span><span class="cl">The Satan:</span> Did you cling to Ba'alei Ra'asan and engage in Torah?</p>
<p class="bas indent2"><span class="nm">4.</span>Even though he had not, when he died, a pillar of fire separated him from everyone else.	This happens for only one or two in a generation.</p>
<p class="bas indent1"><span class="nm">(l)</span>R. Alexandri came close and asked (that the fire cease) for the honor of Chachamim. The fire continued. He asked 'for the honor of your father'; the fire continued. He asked 'for your own honor'; the fire abated.</p>
<p class="bas indent1"><span class="nm">(m)</span><span class="cl">Abaye:</span> The fire was to keep away anyone who did not fulfill everything in the Torah.</p>
<p class="bas indent1"><span class="nm">(n)</span><span class="cl">Rav Ada bar Masnah:</span> This includes yourself! You do not have a railing on your roof!</p>
<p class="bas indent2"><span class="nm">1.</span>Really, Abaye had a railing. The wind had blown it down.</p>
