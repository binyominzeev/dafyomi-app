<div class="indent1"><span class="nm">(a)</span><p><span class="cl">Answer #1 (Ravina):</span> No, both refer to Kodshim Kalim;</p></div>
<div class="indent2"><span class="nm">1.</span><p>Beraisa #1 is like R. Yishmael (he learns meat from blood. Since blood cannot be offered when travelling, Kodshim meat becomes Pasul). Beraisa #2 is like Chachamim.</p></div>
<div class="indent1"><span class="nm">(b)</span><p><span class="cl">Answer #2:</span> Both refer to Kodshei Kodoshim;</p></div>
<div class="indent2"><span class="nm">1.</span><p>Beraisa #2 does not permit eating Kodshim in two encampments, rather, before taking down the Mishkan (this is not the simple meaning of the text, but Rashi and Tosfos say that we must understand it to mean this), and after taking down the Mishkan (this is <i>like</i> in two places);</p></div>
<div class="bbbline">61b----------------------------------------61b</p></div>
<div class="indent2"><span class="nm">2.</span><p>One might have thought that (since the Mishkan is dissembled, there is no Kedushah to the Chatzer), and Kodshim are disqualified as if they left their proper place. The Beraisa teaches, this is not so.</p></div>
<div class="indent2"><span class="nm">3.</span><p><span class="cl">Suggestion:</span> Perhaps they are disqualified!</p></div>
<div class="indent2"><span class="nm">4.</span><p>Rejection "V'Nasa Ohel Mo'ed" - even though it is in transit, it has the Kedushah of Ohel Mo'ed.</p></div>
<div class="subject"><span class="nm">2)</span><p>CHANGES TO THE <i>MIZBE'ACH</i></p></div>
<div class="indent1"><span class="nm">(a)</span><p><span class="cl">(Rav Huna):</span> The Mizbe'ach in Shilo was of stones.</p></div>
<div class="indent2"><span class="nm">1.</span><p><span class="cl">(Beraisa - R. Eliezer ben Yakov):</span> Three verses say "Avanim", to teach about three Mizbechos that were (Rashi - permitted to be) made of stones, in Shilo, in Nov and Giv'on (we learn both of these from one verse, since both were Bamos and not proper Mizbechos) and in the Beis ha'Mikdash.</p></div>
<div class="indent1"><span class="nm">(b)</span><p><span class="cl">Question (Rav Acha bar Ami - Beraisa):</span> The fire that descended from Shamayim (to the Mizbe'ach ha'Nechoshes) in the days of Moshe did not cease, until a new fire descended when Shlomo built (a new Mizbe'ach in) the Beis ha'Mikdash;</p></div>
<div class="indent2"><span class="nm">1.</span><p>Shlomo's fire did not cease until the days of Menasheh. (Even though his grandfather Achaz abolished the Avodah (Sanhedrin 103b), we must say that the fire did not cease until Menasheh's reign.)</p></div>
<div class="indent2"><span class="nm">2.</span><p>According to Rav Huna, Moshe's fire ceased when they built a new Mizbe'ach in Shilo!</p></div>
<div class="indent1"><span class="nm">(c)</span><p><span class="cl">Answer #1:</span> Rav Huna's teaching is according to R. Noson.</p></div>
<div class="indent2"><span class="nm">1.</span><p><span class="cl">(Beraisa - R. Noson):</span> The Mizbe'ach in Shilo was made of copper. It was hollow, and they filled it with stones.</p></div>
<div class="indent1"><span class="nm">(d)</span><p><span class="cl">Answer #2 (Rav Nachman bar Yitzchak):</span> The Beraisa says that Moshe's fire did not cease. It was not idle. (Even though (in Shilo) Korbanos were not brought on the Mizbe'ach ha'Nechoshes, rather, on a stone Mizbe'ach.)</p></div>
<div class="indent2"><span class="nm">1.</span><p><span class="cl">Question:</span> What is the meaning of 'it was not idle'?</p></div>
<div class="indent2"><span class="nm">2.</span><p><span class="cl">Answer #1 (Rabanan):</span> It spewed forth flames to the stone Mizbe'ach to consume the Korbanos.</p></div>
<div class="indent2"><span class="nm">3.</span><p><span class="cl">Answer #2 (Rav Papa):</span> Sometimes the fire would be on one Mizbe'ach, and sometimes on the other.</p></div>
<div class="indent1"><span class="nm">(e)</span><p><span class="cl">(Mishnah):</span> When the exiles returned (with Ezra, to build the second Beis ha'Mikdash) they added four Amos onto the Mizbe'ach on the south side, and four Amos on the west side. The addition was an 'L' shape.</p></div>
<div class="indent1"><span class="nm">(f)</span><p><span class="cl">Question:</span> Why did they make it bigger?</p></div>
<div class="indent1"><span class="nm">(g)</span><p><span class="cl">Answer #1 (Rav Yosef):</span> (The dimensions of) Shlomo's Mizbe'ach were not big enough.</p></div>
<div class="indent2"><span class="nm">1.</span><p><span class="cl">Objection (Abaye):</span> In the first Mikdash, "Yehudah v'Yisrael Rabim ka'Chol Asher Al ha'Yam", yet the Mizbe'ach was big enough. In the second Mikdash "Kol ha'Kahal k'Echad Arba Ribo..." (there were less than 50,000 people), all the more so it was big enough!</p></div>
<div class="indent2"><span class="nm">2.</span><p><span class="cl">Answer (Rav Yosef):</span> In the first Mikdash, fire of Shamayim consumed the Korbanos (supernaturally) quickly. This did not happen in the second Mikdash.</p></div>
<div class="indent1"><span class="nm">(h)</span><p><span class="cl">Answer #2 (Ravin):</span> (In the first Mikdash, Nesachim would flow into Shisim (a pit south-west of the Mizbe'ach.) They enlarged the Mizbe'ach in order that the Shisim would be within (under) the Mizbe'ach;</p></div>
<div class="indent2"><span class="nm">1.</span><p>At first, they expounded "Mizbe'ach Adamah" - there cannot be any gap beneath it;</p></div>
<div class="indent2"><span class="nm">2.</span><p>Later, they reasoned that drinking ('consumption' of libations) should be like eating (Korbanos that are burned, i.e. within the boundaries of the Mizbe'ach).</p></div>
<div class="indent2"><span class="nm">3.</span><p>"Mizbe'ach Adamah" teaches that the Mizbe'ach cannot be built over domes or tunnels (that are not needed for the Mizbe'ach).</p></div>
