<div class="subject"><span class="nm">1)</span><p>WHERE TO SAY <i>ANEINU</i> (cont.)</p></div>
<div class="indent1"><span class="nm">(a)</span><p><span class="cl">Support for objection (R. Ashi):</span> We see that the second and third series of fasts were identical in having twenty-four Berachos from the Mishnah:</p></div>
<div class="indent2"><span class="nm">1.</span><p>The Mishnah states that the last series were different to the previous series in that the Shofar was blown and the stores were locked.</p></div>
<div class="indent2"><span class="nm">2.</span><p>The implication is that they were identical in all other aspects.</p></div>
<div class="indent2"><span class="nm">3.</span><p><span class="cl">Suggested objection:</span> Other differences were left out.</p></div>
<div class="indent2"><span class="nm">4.</span><p><span class="cl">Refutation:</span> It says that "these were the [only] differences"!</p></div>
<div class="indent2"><span class="nm">5.</span><p><span class="cl">Objection:</span> But we know that the difference of the Aron being placed in the street was left out!</p></div>
<div class="indent2"><span class="nm">6.</span><p><span class="cl">Refutation:</span> It was not left out; it was mentioned in the other Perek.</p></div>
<div class="indent1"><span class="nm">(b)</span><p><span class="cl">Objection:</span> If so, we can also say that there is a difference in the number of Berachos, and it was not mentioned as it is mentioned in the other Perek.</p></div>
<div class="indent1"><span class="nm">(c)</span><p><span class="cl">Question:</span> In conclusion, where does one say Aneinu?</p></div>
<div class="indent1"><span class="nm">(d)</span><p><span class="cl">Opinion #1:</span> Between the Berachos of Ge'ulah and Refuah.</p></div>
<div class="indent1"><span class="nm">(e)</span><p><span class="cl">Opinion #2:</span> In the Berachah of Shome'a Tefilah.</p></div>
<div class="indent1"><span class="nm">(f)</span><p>The Halachah is that it is said in the Berachah of Shome'a Tefilah.</p></div>
<div class="subject"><span class="nm">2)</span><p>PREGNANT AND NURSING MOTHERS</p></div>
<div class="indent1"><span class="nm">(a)</span><p><span class="cl">Tana #1:</span> Pregnant and nursing mothers fast in the first set of fasts, but not in the last set.</p></div>
<div class="indent1"><span class="nm">(b)</span><p><span class="cl">Tana #2:</span> They fast in the last set of fasts, but not in the first set.</p></div>
<div class="indent1"><span class="nm">(c)</span><p><span class="cl">Tana #3:</span> They do not fast in the first or last set of fasts.</p></div>
<div class="indent1"><span class="nm">(d)</span><p><span class="cl">(R. Ashi):</span> If we explain that they fasted in the middle set of fasts, we can reconcile all these statements.</p></div>
<div class="subject"><span class="nm">3)</span><p>SHOFAR</p></div>
<div class="indent1"><span class="nm">(a)</span><p>The Mishnah states that the last series were different to the previous series in that they were Masri'in and the stores were locked.</p></div>
<div class="indent1"><span class="nm">(b)</span><p><span class="cl">(R. Yehudah):</span> Masri'in means that the Shofar was blown.</p></div>
<div class="indent1"><span class="nm">(c)</span><p><span class="cl">(R. Yehudah b. R. Shmuel bar Shilas citing Rav):</span> It means that they would cry out with Aneinu.</p></div>
<div class="indent1"><span class="nm">(d)</span><p>The presumption is that each does not hold of the other's view.</p></div>
<div class="indent1"><span class="nm">(e)</span><p><span class="cl">Question:</span> We see in a Beraisa that in the last set of seven fasts, there were a total of eighteen Hasra'os, and Yericho is the Siman - and Yericho was conquered with Shofaros!?</p></div>
<div class="indent1"><span class="nm">(f)</span><p><span class="cl">Answer:</span> All agree that Masri'in refers to Shofar; the dispute is whether it also refers to Aneinu.</p></div>
<div class="indent1"><span class="nm">(g)</span><p><span class="cl">Question:</span> We see in a Beraisa that Masri'in only refers to Shofar:</p></div>
<div class="indent2"><span class="nm">1.</span><p>For other plagues, such as skin disease, locusts, flies, hornets, mosquitoes, snake and scorpion infestations, they were not Masri'in, only cry out in prayer.</p></div>
<div class="indent1"><span class="nm">(h)</span><p><span class="cl">Answer:</span> It is a dispute between Tana'im:</p></div>
<div class="indent2"><span class="nm">1.</span><p><span class="cl">(Beraisa):</span> On Shabbos, we are Masri'in for besieged or flooded cities and storm-tossed ships.</p></div>
<div class="indent2"><span class="nm">2.</span><p><span class="cl">(R. Yosi):</span> We do so to call aid, but not in prayer.</p></div>
<div class="indent2"><span class="nm">3.</span><p>It cannot be referring to Shofar, as that is forbidden on Shabbos; it must refer to Aneinu, and we see it is referred to with Masri'in.</p></div>

<div class="subject"><span class="nm">4)</span><p>ADDING MORE FASTS</p></div>
<div class="indent1"><span class="nm">(a)</span><p>In the days of R. Yehudah Nesiah, thirteen fasts were decreed, which were not answered, so he considered decreeing more.</p></div>
<div class="indent1"><span class="nm">(b)</span><p>R. Ami told him not to overburden the community.</p></div>
<div class="indent1"><span class="nm">(c)</span><p>R. Aba claimed that R. Ami only said this to avoid fasting himself; rather, for any troubles other than rain, we fast until we are answered.</p></div>
<div class="indent2"><span class="nm">1.</span><p>Likewise, a Beraisa states that the sequence of fasts was only said for rain, but for other troubles, we fast until we are answered.</p></div>
<div class="indent1"><span class="nm">(d)</span><p><span class="cl">Question:</span> Doesn't this contradict R. Ami?</p></div>
<div class="indent1"><span class="nm">(e)</span><p><span class="cl">Answer:</span> It is a dispute between Tana'im:</p></div>
<div class="indent2"><span class="nm">1.</span><p><span class="cl">(Rebbi):</span> We do not impose more than thirteen fasts on the community, so as not to overburden them.</p></div>
<div class="indent2"><span class="nm">2.</span><p><span class="cl">(R. Shimon b. Gamliel):</span> The reason is that the time for rainfall has passed.</p></div>
<div class="subject"><span class="nm">5)</span><p>PLACES WITH SPECIAL NEEDS</p></div>
<div class="indent1"><span class="nm">(a)</span><p><span class="cl">The Bnei Ninveh asked Rebbi:</span> "We who need rain even in midsummer, should we pray for rain like individuals, in Shome'a Tefilah, or as a community, in Birchas ha'Shanim?</p></div>
<div class="indent1"><span class="nm">(b)</span><p>He replied that they should pray like individuals.</p></div>
<div class="indent1"><span class="nm">(c)</span><p><span class="cl">Question:</span> We see otherwise in a Beraisa:</p></div>
<div class="indent2"><span class="nm">1.</span><p>The given order of fasts applies to an era when the seasons function as normal and Yisrael are in their land, but nowadays, it changes according to the needs of the year and the location.</p></div>
<div class="indent1"><span class="nm">(d)</span><p><span class="cl">Answer:</span> You cannot challenge Rebbi with a Beraisa; he is a Tana and he can argue with it.</p></div>
<div class="indent1"><span class="nm">(e)</span><p><span class="cl">Question:</span> In conclusion, where should they ask for rain?</p></div>
<div class="indent1"><span class="nm">(f)</span><p><span class="cl">(R. Nachman):</span> In Birchas ha'Shanim.</p></div>
<div class="indent1"><span class="nm">(g)</span><p><span class="cl">(R. Sheshes):</span> In the Berachah of Shome'a Tefilah.</p></div>
<div class="indent1"><span class="nm">(h)</span><p>The Halachah is that they should say it in Shome'a Tefilah.</p></div>
<div class="subject"><span class="nm">6)</span><p>CLOSING THE STORES</p></div>
<div class="indent1"><span class="nm">(a)</span><p>The Mishnah said that on Monday, the doors to the stores would be partially opened before dark, and on Thursday, all day, because of Shabbos.</p></div>
<div class="indent1"><span class="nm">(b)</span><p><span class="cl">Question:</span> Does this mean that on Thursday they would be partially open all day, or fully open all day?</p></div>
<div class="indent1"><span class="nm">(c)</span><p><span class="cl">Answer:</span> We see the latter in a Beraisa:</p></div>
<div class="indent2"><span class="nm">1.</span><p>On Monday, the doors to the stores would be partially opened before dark, and on Thursday, they would be fully open all day, because of Shabbos.</p></div>
<div class="indent2"><span class="nm">2.</span><p>On Monday, if he had two doors, one should be open and the other closed.</p></div>
<div class="indent2"><span class="nm">3.</span><p>If he had chairs blocking the view of his door, it can be left open.</p></div>
<div class="subject"><span class="nm">7)</span><p>BUILDING AND PLANTING</p></div>
<div class="indent1"><span class="nm">(a)</span><p>The Mishnah said that if these fasts did not work either, people must decrease business, building, planting...</p></div>
<div class="indent1"><span class="nm">(b)</span><p>Building and planting refers to buildings and plantings for pleasure.</p></div>
<div class="indent1"><span class="nm">(c)</span><p>Building for pleasure refers to building a house for one's son who is about to marry.</p></div>
<div class="indent1"><span class="nm">(d)</span><p>Planting for pleasure refers to planting a tree in honor of the king's new son.</p></div>
<div class="subject"><span class="nm">8)</span><p>GREETING</p></div>
<div class="indent1"><span class="nm">(a)</span><p>The Mishnah also forbade greeting people in these circumstances.</p></div>
<div class="indent1"><span class="nm">(b)</span><p><span class="cl">(Beraisa):</span> Talmidei Chachamim may not greet each other.</p></div>
<div class="indent2"><span class="nm">1.</span><p>If greeted by an Am ha'Aretz, one should reply in a low voice.</p></div>
<div class="indent1"><span class="nm">(c)</span><p>They should dress and sit as mourners, as excommunicated people, despised by Hash-m, until He has mercy upon them.</p></div>
<div class="indent1"><span class="nm">(d)</span><p><span class="cl">(R. Elazar):</span> An important person may not prostrate himself in prayer unless he is as certain as Yeshoshua to be answered.</p></div>
<div class="indent1"><span class="nm">(e)</span><p>An important person may not wear sackcloth unless he is as certain as Yehoram ben Achav to be answered.</p></div>
<div class="indent1"><span class="nm">(f)</span><p>Not everyone is answered by rending their clothes, and not everyone is answered through falling down.</p></div>
<div class="indent2"><span class="nm">1.</span><p>Moshe and Aharon were answered by falling on their faces.</p></div>
<div class="indent2"><span class="nm">2.</span><p>Yehoshua and Kalev were answered by rending their clothes.</p></div>
<div class="indent2"><span class="nm">3.</span><p><span class="cl">Objection:</span> Since it says "<i>And</i> Yehoshua", it means that he did both.</p></div>
<div class="indent1"><span class="nm">(g)</span><p>Not everyone is answered by bowing down, and not everyone is answered by prostrating themselves.</p></div>
<div class="indent2"><span class="nm">1.</span><p>Kings are answered by bowing down.</p></div>
<div class="indent2"><span class="nm">2.</span><p>Princes are answered by prostrating themselves.</p></div>
<div class="indent2"><span class="nm">3.</span><p><span class="cl">Objection:</span> Since it says "Princes <i>and</i> they shall prostrate themselves", it means that they did both.</p></div>
