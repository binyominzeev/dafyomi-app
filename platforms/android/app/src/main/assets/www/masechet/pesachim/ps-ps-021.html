<div class="subject"><span class="nm">1)</span><p>ALL AGREE WHEN THERE IS NO LOSS</p></div>
<div class="indent1"><span class="nm">(a)</span><p><span class="cl">(R. Yosi b'Rebbi Chanina):</span> R. Eliezer and R. Yehoshua argue about when Terumah falls into less than 100 times its own volume of Tamei Chulin - but if there is at least 100 times as much, all agree that one may not Metamei it [because the mixture will be permitted].</p></div>
<div class="indent1"><span class="nm">(b)</span><p><span class="cl">Support (Beraisa):</span> If a barrel of Terumah broke in the upper winepress and it is about to fall into 100 times its own volume of Tamei Chulin below, R. Eliezer agrees to R. Yehoshua that if one can save a Revi'is in Taharah, he must do so; and if he cannot, he must allow the Terumah to fall, he may not actively Metamei it.</p></div>
<div class="indent1"><span class="nm">(c)</span><p><span class="cl">Question:</span> Why does it say that R. Eliezer agrees to R. Yehoshua - it should say that R. Yehoshua [who permits to actively Metamei] agrees to R. Eliezer [who forbids this]!</p></div>
<div class="indent1"><span class="nm">(d)</span><p><span class="cl">Answer #1 (Rava):</span> The Beraisa must be switched to say that R. Yehoshua agrees to R. Eliezer.</p></div>
<div class="indent1"><span class="nm">(e)</span><p><span class="cl">Answer #2 (Rav Huna brei d'Rav Yehoshua):</span> We need not switch it - [it refers to saving a Revi'is in Taharah;] the case is, the inside of the Kli is Tahor and the outside is Tamei;</p></div>
<div class="indent2"><span class="nm">1.</span><p>One might have thought that R. Eliezer [who does not allow to overtly Metamei] would forbid saving, lest Terumah touch the outside and become Tamei - the Beraisa teaches that this is not so, he agrees that one [may and] must save.</p></div>

<div class="subject"><span class="nm">2)</span><p>WHEN DOES CHAMETZ BECOME FORBIDDEN?</p></div>
<div class="indent1"><span class="nm">(a)</span><p><span class="cl">(Mishnah):</span> As long as it is permitted to eat [Chametz on Erev Pesach], one may feed it to Behemos and Chayos (domestic and wild animals) and birds or sell it to a Nochri; one may benefit from it;</p></div>
<div class="indent2"><span class="nm">1.</span><p>After the [permitted] time expires, it is Asur b'Hana'ah; one may not use (burn) it to heat an oven;</p></div>
<div class="indent1"><span class="nm">(b)</span><p>R. Yehudah says, the only way to fulfill Bi'ur is through burning;</p></div>
<div class="indent1"><span class="nm">(c)</span><p>Chachamim say, one may even crumble it and cast it into the wind or the sea.</p></div>
<div class="indent1"><span class="nm">(d)</span><p><span class="cl">(Gemara) Inference:</span> As long as it is permitted to eat, one may feed [animals] - once it is forbidden to eat, one may not feed.</p></div>
<div class="indent2"><span class="nm">1.</span><p><span class="cl">Suggestion:</span> Our Mishnah is unlike R. Yehudah - he forbids eating in the fifth hour but permits feeding!</p></div>
<div class="indent2"><span class="nm">2.</span><p><span class="cl">(Mishnah - R. Meir):</span> One may eat Chametz until the end of the fifth hour; we burn it at the beginning of the sixth hour;</p></div>
<div class="indent2"><span class="nm">3.</span><p>R. Yehudah says, one may eat until the end of four hours; we Toleh during the fifth hour, and we burn at the beginning of the sixth hour.</p></div>
<div class="indent1"><span class="nm">(e)</span><p><span class="cl">Objection:</span> It is also unlike R. Meir!</p></div>
<div class="indent2"><span class="nm">1.</span><p>Why does it say 'As long as it is permitted to eat' [connoting that some people are permitted and others are forbidden] - it should say 'as long as one may eat' (R. Meir holds that there is one time limit [for eating] for everyone)!</p></div>
<div class="indent1"><span class="nm">(f)</span><p><span class="cl">Answer (Rabah bar Ula):</span> Indeed, our Mishnah is R. Gamliel:</p></div>
<div class="indent2"><span class="nm">1.</span><p><span class="cl">(Mishnah - R. Gamliel):</span> Chulin may be eaten until the end of the fourth hour; Terumah may be eaten until the end of the fifth hour; we burn at the beginning of the sixth hour.</p></div>
<div class="indent2"><span class="nm">2.</span><p>Our Mishnah means, as long as Kohanim may eat Terumah (five hours), a Yisrael may feed Chulin to animals.</p></div>
<div class="indent1"><span class="nm">(g)</span><p><span class="cl">Question:</span> Why does the Mishnah specify Behemos and Chayos?</p></div>
<div class="indent1"><span class="nm">(h)</span><p><span class="cl">Answer:</span> It must teach both of them:</p></div>
<div class="indent2"><span class="nm">1.</span><p>Had it taught only Behemos, we would think that one may feed them because one will see what they leave over [and destroy it] - but Chayos hide their leftovers, we would not permit feeding them;</p></div>
<div class="indent2"><span class="nm">2.</span><p>Had it taught only Chayos, we would think that one may feed them because they hide their leftovers, one will not transgress Bal Yera'eh (Tosfos - unless he sees it; Rashi, according to Maharshal - even though he transgresses Bal Yimatzei even without seeing it), but we would not permit feeding Behemos, lest they leave over and he will forget to Mevatel, and he will transgress Bal Yera'eh and Bal Yimatzei.</p></div>
<div class="indent1"><span class="nm">(i)</span><p><span class="cl">Question:</span> Why does the Mishnah need to permit birds?</p></div>
<div class="indent1"><span class="nm">(j)</span><p><span class="cl">Answer:</span> Once it says Behemos and Chayos, it also says birds.</p></div>
<div class="indent1"><span class="nm">(k)</span><p><span class="cl">(Mishnah):</span> Or sell it to a Nochri.</p></div>
<div class="indent1"><span class="nm">(l)</span><p><span class="cl">Objection:</span> This is obvious!</p></div>
<div class="indent1"><span class="nm">(m)</span><p><span class="cl">Answer:</span> The Mishnah teaches unlike the following Tana:</p></div>
<div class="indent2"><span class="nm">1.</span><p><span class="cl">(Beraisa - Beis Shamai):</span> One may not sell Chametz to a Nochri unless he knows that the Nochri will finish it before Pesach;</p></div>
<div class="indent2"><span class="nm">2.</span><p>Beis Hillel permit selling Chametz as long as it is permitted to eat it;</p></div>
<div class="bbbline">21b----------------------------------------21b</p></div>
<div class="indent2"><span class="nm">3.</span><p>R. Yehudah says, all kinds of Kutach (dips made with Chametz; they are consumed very slowly) may not be sold 30 days before Pesach.</p></div>
<div class="indent1"><span class="nm">(n)</span><p><span class="cl">(Mishnah):</span> One may benefit from it.</p></div>
<div class="indent1"><span class="nm">(o)</span><p><span class="cl">Objection:</span> This is obvious (we already permitted feeding animals and selling it to Nochrim)!</p></div>
<div class="indent1"><span class="nm">(p)</span><p><span class="cl">Answer:</span> The Mishnah discusses Chametz that was charred before [the time of Isur] - it permits benefit even after Chametz is forbidden [for this is not considered Chametz].</p></div>
<div class="indent1"><span class="nm">(q)</span><p><span class="cl">(Mishnah):</span> After the [permitted] time expires, it is Asur b'Hana'ah.</p></div>
<div class="indent1"><span class="nm">(r)</span><p><span class="cl">Objection:</span> This is obvious!</p></div>
<div class="indent1"><span class="nm">(s)</span><p><span class="cl">Answer:</span> The Chidush is, it becomes Asur b'Hana'ah mid'Rabanan [while it is still permitted mid'Oraisa]:</p></div>
<div class="indent2"><span class="nm">1.</span><p><span class="cl">(Rav Gidal):</span> If one was Mekadesh with wheat of Kordenisa from (Rashi - the start of; Tosfos - the end of) the sixth hour or later, we are not concerned for the Kidushin. (Rashi - the wheat is forbidden mid'Rabanan, so it is worthless. Tosfos - just like Chachamim said that Chametz mid'Rabanan is Asur b'Hana'ah at a time when real Chametz is Asur mid'Oraisa, they said that Chametz mid'Oraisa is Asur b'Hana'ah at a time when real Chametz is Asur mid'Rabanan.)</p></div>
<div class="subject"><span class="nm">3)</span><p>THE SOURCE TO FORBID BENEFIT</p></div>
<div class="indent1"><span class="nm">(a)</span><p><span class="cl">(Mishnah):</span> One may not use it to heat an oven.</p></div>
<div class="indent1"><span class="nm">(b)</span><p><span class="cl">Objection:</span> This is obvious!</p></div>
<div class="indent1"><span class="nm">(c)</span><p><span class="cl">Answer:</span> This is a Chidush according to R. Yehudah:</p></div>
<div class="indent2"><span class="nm">1.</span><p>R. Yehudah says that the only way to fulfill Bi'ur is through burning - [since it is a Mitzvah,] one might have thought that one may benefit from it at the time - the Mishnah teaches that this is not so.</p></div>
<div class="indent1"><span class="nm">(d)</span><p><span class="cl">(Chizkiyah) Question:</span> What is the source that Chametz during Pesach is Asur b'Hana'ah?</p></div>
<div class="indent1"><span class="nm">(e)</span><p><span class="cl">Answer:</span> "V'Lo <i>Ye'achel</i> Chametz" (passive, it will not be eaten) - you have no permission to eat it [or benefit from it, since the savings or what is exchanged for it can be consumed; Rashash - it may not be eaten, even by a dog - other benefit is likewise forbidden].</p></div>
<div class="indent1"><span class="nm">(f)</span><p><span class="cl">Inference:</span> Had it not said <i>Ye'achel</i>, we would have said that one may not eat it but one may benefit from it - this is unlike R. Avahu.</p></div>
<div class="indent1"><span class="nm">(g)</span><p><span class="cl">(R. Avahu):</span> Wherever the Torah says "Lo Yochal" [or "Lo Ye'achel"], "Lo Sochal," or "Lo Sochlu," it forbids eating and benefit, unless there is a source to permit benefit, like we find by Neveilah;</p></div>
<div class="indent2"><span class="nm">1.</span><p><span class="cl">(Beraisa - R. Meir) Question:</span> "Lo Sochlu Chol Neveilah la'Ger Asher bi'Sh'arecha Titnenah va'Achalah O Machor l'Nochri" only permits giving [a Neveilah for free] to a Ger (Toshav, i.e. a Ben Noach who accepted to observe his Mitzvos) and selling it to a Nochri (idolater).</p></div>
<div class="indent3"><span class="nm">i.</span><p>What is the source to permit selling it to a Ger?</p></div>
<div class="indent2"><span class="nm">2.</span><p><span class="cl">Answer:</span> "La'Ger... Titnenah...O Machor."</p></div>
<div class="indent2"><span class="nm">3.</span><p><span class="cl">Question:</span> What is the source to permit giving it to a Nochri?</p></div>

<div class="indent2"><span class="nm">5.</span><p><span class="cl">Conclusion:</span> It may be given or sold to a Ger or Nochri.</p></div>
<div class="indent2"><span class="nm">6.</span><p>R. Yehudah says, it is permitted only like the Torah says, a gift to a Ger or a sale to a Nochri.</p></div>
<div class="indent2"><span class="nm">7.</span><p><span class="cl">Question:</span> What is R. Yehudah's reason?</p></div>
<div class="indent2"><span class="nm">8.</span><p><span class="cl">Answer:</span> If the Torah meant like R. Meir, it should have said 'La'Ger... Titnenah...<i>u</i>'Machor';</p></div>
<div class="indent3"><span class="nm">i.</span><p>Rather, it says "<i>O</i> Machor" to teach that one may do only like the Torah said. (see note in Appendix)</p></div>
<div class="indent2"><span class="nm">9.</span><p><span class="cl">Answer:</span> "Titnenah va'Achalah O Machor l'Nochri."</p></div>
<div class="indent2"><span class="nm">10.</span><p><span class="cl">Conclusion:</span> It may be given or sold to a Ger or Nochri.</p></div>
<div class="indent2"><span class="nm">11.</span><p>R. Meir says, "O" teaches that it is better to give it to a Ger than to sell it to a Nochri.</p></div>
<div class="indent2"><span class="nm">12.</span><p>R. Yehudah says, since we are commanded to support a Ger but not a Nochri, we already know that a gift to a Ger is better.</p></div>
<div class="indent1"><span class="nm">(h)</span><p><span class="cl">Question (against R. Avahu):</span> According to R. Meir who permits giving and selling to a Ger or Nochri, we understand [the source that Isurei Achilah are Asur b'Hana'ah] - the verse permits benefit from a Neveilah, implying that normally one may not benefit from something forbidden to eat;</p></div>
<div class="indent2"><span class="nm">1.</span><p>But according to R. Yehudah, the verse specifies what is permitted (a gift to a Ger or a sale to a Nochri) - what is the source that normally, Isurei Achilah are Asur b'Hana'ah?</p></div>
