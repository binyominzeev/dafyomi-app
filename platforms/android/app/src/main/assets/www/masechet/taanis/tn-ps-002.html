<p class="bas subject"><span class="nm">1)</span><i>MISHNAH:</i> MENTIONING THE RAINS</p>
<p class="bas indent1"><span class="nm">(a)</span>The might of the rains is mentioned:</p>
<p class="bas indent2"><span class="nm">1.</span><span class="cl">(R. Eliezer):</span> From the first day of Sukos.</p>
<p class="bas indent2"><span class="nm">2.</span><span class="cl">(R. Yehoshua):</span> From the last day of Sukos.</p>
<p class="bas indent3"><span class="nm">i.</span>Since rain on Sukos is a bad sign, why mention it?</p>
<p class="bas indent3"><span class="nm">ii.</span><span class="cl">(R. Eliezer):</span> I did not say to ask for it, only to mention that it happens at its proper time.</p>
<p class="bas indent3"><span class="nm">iii.</span><span class="cl">(R. Yehoshua):</span> If so, it should be mentioned all year!</p>
<p class="bas indent1"><span class="nm">(b)</span>We only ask for rain close to its time.</p>
<p class="bas indent1"><span class="nm">(c)</span><span class="cl">(R. Yehudah):</span> On the last day of Sukos, the Shali'ach Tzibur for Musaf mentions rain, but not that of Shacharis.</p>
<p class="bas indent2"><span class="nm">1.</span>On the first day of Pesach, the Shali'ach Tzibur for Shacharis mentions rain, but not that of Musaf.</p>
<p class="bas subject"><span class="nm">2)</span>THE BASIS OF THE <i>MISHNAH</i></p>
<p class="bas indent1"><span class="nm">(a)</span><span class="cl">Question:</span> Where have we learned that there is an obligation to mention rain, leading the Mishnah to discuss when this begins?</p>
<p class="bas indent2"><span class="nm">1.</span><span class="cl">Suggested answer:</span> In Maseches Berachos, we learned that the might of the rains is mentioned in the Berachah of the Resurrection of the Dead.</p>
<p class="bas indent2"><span class="nm">2.</span><span class="cl">Question:</span> Why was not the date of when it begins discussed there?</p>
<p class="bas indent1"><span class="nm">(b)</span><span class="cl">New answer:</span> Our Tana is continuing from Rosh Hashanah, where we learned that on Sukos, judgment is passed for water.</p>
<p class="bas indent1"><span class="nm">(c)</span><span class="cl">Question:</span> Why does the Mishnah speak of "the might of" the rains?</p>
<p class="bas indent1"><span class="nm">(d)</span><span class="cl">Answer:</span> Because they descend with might, as we see from the following Derashah:</p>
<p class="bas indent2"><span class="nm">1.</span>A Pasuk describes the rain as being "without comprehension" and another Pasuk uses the same term to describe the creation of the world, which is also described as being done with might.</p>
<p class="bas indent1"><span class="nm">(e)</span><span class="cl">Question:</span> How do we know that this should be mentioned during prayer?</p>
<p class="bas indent2"><span class="nm">1.</span>The Pasuk states that we are to serve Hash-m with our hearts, which refers to prayer, and it is followed by a reference to the rain.</p>
<p class="bas indent1"><span class="nm">(f)</span><span class="cl">(R. Yochanan):</span> Hash-m has three keys that are not entrusted to an intermediary - those of rain, childbirth, and resurrection of the dead, as derived from Pesukim.</p>
<p class="bas bbbline">2b----------------------------------------2b</p>
<p class="bas indent2"><span class="nm">1.</span><span class="cl">In Eretz Yisrael, they added:</span> also the key of sustenance.</p>
<p class="bas indent2"><span class="nm">2.</span>R. Yochanan held that that was included in rain.</p>
<p class="bas subject"><span class="nm">3)</span>MENTIONING RAIN</p>
<p class="bas indent1"><span class="nm">(a)</span>The Mishnah quoted R. Eliezer that mention of rainfall begins on the first day of Sukos.</p>
<p class="bas indent1"><span class="nm">(b)</span><span class="cl">Question:</span> Did he learn it from Lulav, and like Lulav, it begins by day, or did he learn it from Nisuch haMayim, and it begins from the evening.</p>
<p class="bas indent1"><span class="nm">(c)</span><span class="cl">Answer:</span> R. Avahu said that he learned it from Lulav.</p>
<p class="bas indent1"><span class="nm">(d)</span>Some say he received this as a tradition, and some say he derived it from the following Beraisa:</p>
<p class="bas indent2"><span class="nm">1.</span>From when do we mention the rains?</p>
<p class="bas indent2"><span class="nm">2.</span><span class="cl">(R. Eliezer):</span> From the day that Lulav is taken.</p>
<p class="bas indent2"><span class="nm">3.</span><span class="cl">(R. Yehoshua):</span> From the day that the Lulav is put away.</p>
<p class="bas indent3"><span class="nm">i.</span><span class="cl">(R. Eliezer):</span> The Four Species are taken as an appeasement for water; like them, the world cannot survive without water (and therefore we should mention the rains on Sukos.)</p>
<p class="bas indent3"><span class="nm">ii.</span><span class="cl">(R. Yehoshua):</span> But rain on Sukos is a bad sign!</p>
<p class="bas indent3"><span class="nm">iii.</span><span class="cl">(R. Eliezer):</span> I did not say to ask for rain, only to mention it, just as Techiyas ha'Meisim is mentioned all year yet only happens at its proper time; therefore, if a person wants to mention the rains all year, he can.</p>
<p class="bas indent3"><span class="nm">iv.</span><span class="cl">(Rebbi):</span> From the day that we stop asking for rain, we should also stop mentioning it.</p>
<p class="bas indent2"><span class="nm">4.</span><span class="cl">(R. Yehudah b. Beseirah):</span> The rains are mentioned from the second day of Sukos.</p>
<p class="bas indent2"><span class="nm">5.</span><span class="cl">(R. Akiva):</span> They are mentioned from the sixth day of Sukos.</p>
<p class="bas indent2"><span class="nm">6.</span><span class="cl">(R. Yehudah, citing R. Yehoshua):</span> On the last day of Sukos (Shemini Atzeres), the Shali'ach Tzibur for Musaf mentions the rain, but not that of Shacharis; on the first day of Pesach, the Shali'ach Tzibur of Shacharis mentions the rain, but not that of Musaf.</p>
<p class="bas indent1"><span class="nm">(e)</span><span class="cl">Question:</span> What is R. Yehoshua's response to R. Eliezer's argument?</p>
<p class="bas indent1"><span class="nm">(f)</span><span class="cl">Answer:</span> Techiyas ha'Meisim would be welcomed at any time, but a Mishnah teaches that rain after Nisan is a bad sign.</p>
<p class="bas indent1"><span class="nm">(g)</span><span class="cl">Question:</span> What is the reason of R. Yehudah b. Beseirah?</p>
<p class="bas indent1"><span class="nm">(h)</span><span class="cl">Answer:</span> The letters of MaYiM are spelled out in the Torah, beginning on the second day, alluding to the Nisuch ha'Mayim.</p>
<p class="bas indent1"><span class="nm">(i)</span>R. Akiva's reason is that the Pasuk of the sixth day alludes to two Nisuchim, that of wine and that of water.</p>
<p class="bas indent2"><span class="nm">1.</span><span class="cl">Question:</span> Perhaps they both refer to wine?</p>
<p class="bas indent2"><span class="nm">2.</span><span class="cl">Answer:</span> R. Akiva holds of R. Yehudah b. Beseira's acronym of MaYiM.</p>
<p class="bas indent2"><span class="nm">3.</span><span class="cl">Question:</span> Why does he not also hold that it begins on the second day?</p>
<p class="bas indent2"><span class="nm">4.</span><span class="cl">Answer:</span> As the superfluous mention of Nisuch is on the sixth day.</p>
