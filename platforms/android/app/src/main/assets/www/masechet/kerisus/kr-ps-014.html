<p class="bas subject"><span class="nm">1)</span>MULTIPLE <i>CHIYUVIM</i> FOR ONE <i>ACHILAH (</i>cont<i>.)</i></p>
<p class="bas indent1"><span class="nm">(a)</span><span class="cl">(Gemara) Suggestion:</span> R. Meir (the first Tana) holds that Isur Chal Al Isur (a second prohibition can take effect on something that is already forbidden. The Chelev was forbidden before it became Kodesh or Nosar... )!</p>
<p class="bas indent1"><span class="nm">(b)</span><span class="cl">Rejection:</span> He holds that Ein Isur Chal Al Isur, unless the new Isur is Kolel (it forbids also things which were previously permitted) or Mosif (forbids the Isur to more people (or in more ways) than it was forbidden beforehand):</p>
<p class="bas indent2"><span class="nm">1.</span>At first the person was Tahor, so only Chelev was forbidden. When he became Tamei, all Kodshim became forbidden to him, so the Isur Tum'ah takes effect on Chelev;</p>
<p class="bas indent2"><span class="nm">2.</span>At first Chelev was forbidden to eat but permitted to benefit from it. When it became Kodesh, it became Asur b'Hana'ah, therefore the Isur Kodesh takes effect on the Chelev;</p>
<p class="bas indent2"><span class="nm">3.</span>Even when it was Kodesh, the Chelev was forbidden to people but could be offered on the Mizbe'ach. When it became Nosar, it became forbidden to the Mizbe'ach, therefore the Isur Nosar takes effect regarding people;</p>
<p class="bas indent2"><span class="nm">4.</span>When Yom Kipur came, all food became forbidden, therefore the Isur to eat on Yom Kipur takes effect also on the Chelev.</p>
<p class="bas indent1"><span class="nm">(c)</span><span class="cl">Question:</span> Why didn't the Mishnah list a fifth Chiyuv Chatas, for Pigul?</p>
<p class="bas indent1"><span class="nm">(d)</span><span class="cl">Answer #1:</span> Pigul and Nosar cannot apply to the same animal. (If it was Pigul, it is immediately forbidden to people and the Mizbe'ach. Nothing else becomes forbidden when it becomes Nosar). The Tana discusses eating from only one animal.</p>
<p class="bas indent1"><span class="nm">(e)</span><span class="cl">Question:</span> Pigul and Nosar can apply to the same animal! If a limb of Pigul was offered on the Mizbe'ach, it ceases to be Pigul. It will become Nosar (at dawn, and the rest of the animal is Pigul), like Ula taught!</p>
<p class="bas indent2"><span class="nm">1.</span><span class="cl">(Ula):</span> If a Pigul Kometz was thrown on the Mizbe'ach, it loses the status of Pigul. It becomes Nosar.</p>
<p class="bas indent1"><span class="nm">(f)</span><span class="cl">Answer #2:</span> The Tana discusses eating from only one limb.</p>
<p class="bas indent2"><span class="nm">1.</span><span class="cl">Question:</span> Pigul and Nosar can apply to the same limb, if a limb of Pigul was put <i>partially</i> on the Mizbe'ach, and part of it hangs outside the Mizbe'ach. Only the part on the Mizbe'ach ceases to be Pigul and becomes Nosar!</p>
<p class="bas indent2"><span class="nm">2.</span><span class="cl">Answer:</span> No, a limb is considered to be entirely on or entirely off the Mizbe'ach. It depends on its majority. (The whole limb will become Nosar or remain Pigul.)</p>
<p class="bas indent2"><span class="nm">3.</span><span class="cl">Suggestion:</span> We can resolve (affirmatively) Rami bar Chama's question, whether or not a limb is judged according to its majority (Tosfos - if it is partially on the Mizbe'ach, and partially on the ramp)!</p>
<p class="bas indent1"><span class="nm">(g)</span><span class="cl">Answer #3 (and rejection of suggestion):</span> The Tana discusses eating only one k'Zayis.</p>
<p class="bas indent2"><span class="nm">1.</span><span class="cl">Question:</span> One of the Chata'os is for (eating on) Yom Kipur. The Shi'ur to be liable is k'Koseves (a large date), which is two k'Zeisim!</p>
<p class="bas indent2"><span class="nm">2.</span><span class="cl">Answer #1 (R. Zeira):</span> The case is, he ate a kidney with its Chelev (a k'Koseves in all. He is liable for the other Isurim for a k'Zayis of Chelev, and the Chelev helps cause the Chiyuv for Yom Kipur).</p>
<p class="bas indent2"><span class="nm">3.</span><span class="cl">Answer #2 (Rav Papa):</span> He ate dates with the Chelev to complete the Shi'ur of k'Koseves.</p>
<p class="bas indent1"><span class="nm">(h)</span><span class="cl">Answer #4 (Rav Ada bar Acha):</span> The text of the Mishnah says that one is liable five Chata'os (and an Asham), i.e. he is liable also for a k'Zayis of Pigul.</p>
<p class="bas indent2"><span class="nm">1.</span>Rav Ada disagrees with the answers given above.</p>
<p class="bas indent1"><span class="nm">(i)</span><span class="cl">Question:</span> If so, he can be liable a sixth Chatas, if he ate also a k'Zayis blood!</p>
<p class="bas indent1"><span class="nm">(j)</span><span class="cl">Answer:</span> The Tana teaches the Chiyuvim that can come for one swallowing. One cannot swallow more than two k'Zeisim at once.</p>
<p class="bas subject"><span class="nm">2)</span>CHIYUV FOR HOTZA'AH</p>
<p class="bas indent1"><span class="nm">(a)</span><span class="cl">(Mishnah - R. Meir):</span> If it was Shabbos...</p>
<p class="bas indent1"><span class="nm">(b)</span><span class="cl">Question:</span> Even if it was not Shabbos, he liable for Hotza'ah on Yom Kipur!</p>
<p class="bas indent1"><span class="nm">(c)</span><span class="cl">Answer (Rafram):</span> This teaches that prohibitions of carrying apply only on Shabbos, but not on Yom Kipur.</p>
<p class="bas indent1"><span class="nm">(d)</span><span class="cl">Rejection:</span> Perhaps carrying is forbidden on Yom Kipur. R. Meir means, if it was Shabbos and he took the food outside, he is liable for (Hotza'ah on) Shabbos and Yom Kipur!</p>
<p class="bas indent1"><span class="nm">(e)</span>Rather, Rafram learned from the following Beraisa;</p>
<p class="bas indent2"><span class="nm">1.</span><span class="cl">(Beraisa):</span> "V'Shilach b'Yad Ish <i>Iti</i>" teaches that (the goat may be sent to Azazel) even by a Zar, even if he is Tamei, even on Shabbos. The man must be designated from before Yom Kipur.</p>
<p class="bas indent2"><span class="nm">2.</span><span class="cl">(Rafram):</span> Since a verse is needed to permit sending the goat on Shabbos (even though we know that it is permitted on Yom Kipur), this teaches that prohibitions of carrying apply only on Shabbos, but not on Yom Kipur.</p>
<p class="bas indent1"><span class="nm">(f)</span><span class="cl">Rejection:</span> Perhaps carrying is forbidden on Yom Kipur;</p>
<p class="bas indent2"><span class="nm">1.</span>The Mitzvah is to send it on Yom Kipur, in spite of the Isur Hotza'ah of Yom Kipur. However, without a verse we would not know that it also overrides the Isur Hotza'ah of Shabbos.</p>
<p class="bas indent2"><span class="nm">2.</span>Rafram's teaching is rejected.</p>
<p class="bas subject"><span class="nm">3)</span>MULTIPLE <i>CHIYUVIM</i> FOR ONE ACT OF RELATIONS</p>
<p class="bas indent1"><span class="nm">(a)</span><span class="cl">(Mishnah):</span> One can be liable six Chata'os for one act of Bi'ah. One who has relations with his daughter can be liable for this and for (other Arayos, i.e. if she is also) his sister, his brother's wife, his father's brother's wife, a married woman, and a Nidah.</p>
<p class="bas bbbline">14b----------------------------------------14b</p>
<p class="bas indent1"><span class="nm">(b)</span><span class="cl">(Gemara) Question:</span> (A Stam (anonymous) Mishnah is assumed to be like R. Meir.) R. Meir holds that Ein Isur Chal Al Isur!</p>
<p class="bas indent1"><span class="nm">(c)</span><span class="cl">Answer:</span> He holds that (normally) Ein Isur Chal Al Isur, but if the new Isur is Kolel or Mosif, it takes effect;</p>
<p class="bas indent2"><span class="nm">1.</span>The case is, Esav fathered Plonis through his mother. The Isurim of one's daughter and sister come simultaneously;</p>
<p class="bas indent2"><span class="nm">2.</span>Plonis married Esav's brother. Since this forbids her to Esav's brothers (even paternal brothers, who were formerly permitted to her) the Isur Eshes Ach takes effect also on Esav;</p>
<p class="bas indent2"><span class="nm">3.</span>After (she was widowed or divorced), she married Esav's father's brother (Yishmael). Since the Isur Eshes Achi Aviv takes effect on Yishmael's nephews (who were formerly permitted to her, e.g. sons of Midyan), it also takes effect on Esav. (Alternatively - since she becomes forbidden to Yishmael's sons (Eshes Av) or to his brothers (Eshes Ach), the Isur Eshes Achi Aviv takes effect on Esav);</p>
<p class="bas indent2"><span class="nm">4.</span>Since the Isur Eshes Ish forbids her to all men, it also takes effect on Esav.</p>
<p class="bas indent2"><span class="nm">5.</span>Since the Isur Nidah forbids her to her husband, it also takes effect on Esav.</p>
<p class="bas indent1"><span class="nm">(d)</span><span class="cl">(Mishnah):</span> If (Esav) has relations with his daughter's daughter (Plonis), he can be liable for this and for his daughter-in-law, his brother's wife, his father's brother's wife, a married woman, and a Nidah. (The case is, Plonis married, at different times, Esav's son, Esav's brother, and Esav's uncle.)</p>
<p class="bas indent1"><span class="nm">(e)</span>R. Yosi says, if Esav's father (Yitzchak) had transgressed and married Plonis, Esav will be liable also for Eshes Av.</p>
<p class="bas indent1"><span class="nm">(f)</span><span class="cl">(Gemara) Question:</span> Yitzchak cannot marry (be Mekadesh) her (even b'Di'evad, for she is Eshes Achiv)!</p>
<p class="bas indent1"><span class="nm">(g)</span><span class="cl">Answer (R. Yochanan):</span> The case is, she fell to Yibum to Yitzchak. (We must say that she had married a <i>maternal</i> brother of Esav.)</p>
<p class="bas indent1"><span class="nm">(h)</span><span class="cl">Question:</span> If so, why does it say that Yitzchak transgressed?</p>
<p class="bas indent1"><span class="nm">(i)</span><span class="cl">Answer (R. Yakov):</span> One's son's daughter-in-law is a Sheniyah, i.e. forbidden mid'Rabanan;</p>
<p class="bas indent2"><span class="nm">1.</span><span class="cl">(Beraisa):</span> A daughter-in-law is Ervah. One's son's daughter-in-law is a Sheniyah.</p>
<p class="bas indent2"><span class="nm">2.</span>Similarly, one's son's daughter is Ervah. The daughter of one's son's son, or of the son's son's son, etc. for all generations are Sheniyos.</p>
<p class="bas indent1"><span class="nm">(j)</span><span class="cl">Question:</span> In our Mishnah, R. Yosi (is Mechayev for Eshes Av, he) holds that Isur Chal Al Isur. Elsewhere, he holds otherwise!</p>
<p class="bas indent2"><span class="nm">1.</span><span class="cl">(Mishnah):</span> One who is Chayav two different Misos receives the more stringent one;</p>
<p class="bas indent2"><span class="nm">2.</span>If one is liable two Misos for one transgression, he receives the more stringent one;</p>
<p class="bas indent2"><span class="nm">3.</span>R. Yosi says, he receives the one that arose first.</p>
<p class="bas indent3"><span class="nm">i.</span><span class="cl">(Beraisa - R. Yosi):</span> He receives the one that arose first. If Reuven's mother-in-law (Leah, was single) and got married (and Reuven had relations with her), he is judged for (relations with) a mother-in-law (stoning);</p>
<p class="bas indent3"><span class="nm">ii.</span>If Leah was married when Reuven married her daughter, he is judged for Eshes Ish (choking).</p>
<p class="bas indent1"><span class="nm">(k)</span><span class="cl">Answer (R. Avahu and Ravin):</span> R. Yosi agrees that an Isur Mosif is Chal on other Isurim.</p>
<p class="bas indent1"><span class="nm">(l)</span><span class="cl">Question:</span> Why is Eshes Av an Isur Mosif?</p>
<p class="bas indent1"><span class="nm">(m)</span><span class="cl">Answer:</span> The case is, Yitzchak has another son (Yakov). Since Eshes Av forbids Plonis to Yakov, it also takes effect on Esav.</p>
<p class="bas indent1"><span class="nm">(n)</span><span class="cl">(Mishnah):</span> If one has relations with Chamoso (his mother-in-law), he can be liable also for relations with his daughter-in-law, his brother's wife, his father's brother's wife, his wife's sister, a married woman, and a Nidah;</p>
<p class="bas indent1"><span class="nm">(o)</span>The same applies to relations with Em (the mother of) Chamoso or Em Chamav (father-in-law).</p>
<p class="bas indent1"><span class="nm">(p)</span>R. Yochanan ben Nuri says, one is liable three times for Chamoso if she is also Em Chamoso and Em Chamav;</p>
<p class="bas indent1"><span class="nm">(q)</span>Chachamim say, they are all one Shem. (He is liable only once.)</p>
