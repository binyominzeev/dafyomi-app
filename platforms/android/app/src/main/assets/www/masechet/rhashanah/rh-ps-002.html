<div class="indent2"><span class="nm">2.</span><p><span class="cl">Answer:</span> It is needed to teach that even in a case when the second king was already selected in Adar, and he is the son of the first king,, nevertheless he counts his first year from Nisan. when he is coronated.</p></div>
<div class="subject"><span class="nm">3)</span><p>THE SOURCE OF NISAN AS THE NEW YEAR FOR KINGS</p></div>
<div class="indent1"><span class="nm">(a)</span><p>Source #1 (R. Yochanan) The new year for kings is learned from a verse (Melachim I 6,1) that connects the years of King Shlomo's reign to the years from the Exodus, which itself is counted from Nisan.</p></div>
<div class="indent2"><span class="nm">1.</span><p><span class="cl">Question:</span> How do we know that the years from the Exodus are counted from Nisan and not from Tishrei?</p></div>
<div class="indent2"><span class="nm">2.</span><p><span class="cl">Answer:</span> The Torah's considering Aharon's death in Av (Bamidbar 33, 38) and Moshe's subsequent speech in Shevat (Devarim 1,3) as being in the same (40th) year, shows that the year cannot begin from Tishrei.</p></div>
<div class="indent2"><span class="nm">3.</span><p><span class="cl">Question:</span> How do we know that the year of Moshe's speech is being counted from the Exodus and not from the building of the Mishkan which was a year later?</p></div>
<div class="indent2"><span class="nm">4.</span><p><span class="cl">Answer (based on Rav Papa's statement later):</span> The identical phrase (Gezeirah Shava) of "the fortieth year" in each verse shows that they are both being counted from the Exodus.</p></div>
<div class="indent2"><span class="nm">5.</span><p><span class="cl">Question:</span> How do we know that Moshe's speech was subsequent to Aharon's death? Perhaps it was before his death!.</p></div>
<div class="indent2"><span class="nm">6.</span><p><span class="cl">Answer:</span> Moshe's speech was after Sichon's death (Devarim 1,4) and when Aharon died Sichon was still alive.This can be proven as follows</p></div>
<div class="indent3"><span class="nm">i.</span><p>The verse (Bamidmar 21,1) states that "the Cana'ani King Arad heard" (that Aharon died) and he attacked Israel.</p></div>
<div class="indent3"><span class="nm">ii.</span><p>'The previous verse (Bamidmar 20,29) states that Israel "saw that ("ki") Aharon died" is understood as "they feared (attack) because Aharon died."</p></div>
<div class="indent3"><span class="nm">iii.</span><p>This is in accordance with Resh Lakish's teaching that "ki" can only mean 'if," "perhaps," "rather," and "because" (in this case, it means "because") and not "that".</p></div>
<div class="indent3"><span class="nm">iv.</span><p><span class="cl">Question:</span> We need to know about Sichon, but the verse speaks of Arad and not Sichon!</p></div>
<div class="indent3"><span class="nm">v.</span><p><span class="cl">Answer:</span> Sichon, Arad and Cana'an are all the same person. He was named "Sichon" because he was as wild as a foal ("Siach"); "Cana'an" was his kingdom; and "Arad" was his name; Alternatively, he was named "Arad" because he was as wild as a wild ass ("Arod"); "Cana'an" was his kingdom; and "Sichon" was his name.</p></div>
