<div class="subject"><span class="nm">1)</span><p>WHY THE TORAH HAD TO PROHIBIT YIBUM WITH ARAYOS</p></div>
<div class="indent1"><span class="nm">(a)</span><p><span class="cl">Objection:</span> Our case is unlike Ula's case!</p></div>
<div class="indent2"><span class="nm">1.</span><p>Granted, it is similar if Reuven married Rachel, then his brother Shimon married her sister Leah, and Reuven died. Since Eshes Ach is permitted, also Achos Ishto would be permitted (if not for "Aleha").</p></div>
<div class="indent1"><span class="nm">(b)</span><p><span class="cl">Question #1:</span> If Shimon married before Reuven, the Isur of Achos Ishto came first (and it is not permitted)!</p></div>
<div class="indent1"><span class="nm">(c)</span><p><span class="cl">Question #2:</span> Even when Reuven married before Shimon, the comparison is good only if Reuven died before Shimon married. In this case, Rachel was permitted in the interim.</p></div>
<div class="indent2"><span class="nm">1.</span><p>However, if  Reuven died after Shimon married Leah, Rachel was never permitted!</p></div>
<div class="indent2"><span class="nm">2.</span><p>Surely Ula agree that that if a Metzora had an emission on the night of his eighth day he may not enter his thumb into the Mikdash, since there was never a time when he could bring his Korban (and enter it)!</p></div>
<div class="indent1"><span class="nm">(d)</span><p><span class="cl">Answer:</span> Indeed, "Aleha" is needed only for the case when Reuven married and died before Shimon married.</p></div>
<div class="indent1"><span class="nm">(e)</span><p><span class="cl">Answer #4 (to Question 5:b):</span> If not for "Aleha", we would learn from a Hekesh that all Arayos may do Yibum.</p></div>
<div class="indent2"><span class="nm">1.</span><p><span class="cl">(R. Yonah):</span> "All... will get Kares" - all Arayos are equated to Eshes Ach.</p></div>
<div class="indent2"><span class="nm">2.</span><p>One might have thought that just like Eshes Ach is permitted (for Yibum), all Arayos are permitted. "Aleha" teaches that this is not so.</p></div>
<div class="indent1"><span class="nm">(f)</span><p><span class="cl">Question (Rav Acha mi'Difti):</span> The other Arayos can be equated to Eshes Ach, or to Achos Ishto. Why do we equate them (above, Daf 3b) to Achos Ishto and not to Eshes Ach?</p></div>
<div class="indent1"><span class="nm">(g)</span><p><span class="cl">Answer #1 (Ravina):</span> We equate to be stringent, not to be lenient.</p></div>
<div class="indent1"><span class="nm">(h)</span><p><span class="cl">Answer #2 (Ravina):</span> Each of the other Arayos has two Isurim (itself, and Eshes Ach). It is better to learn from Achos Ishto, which also has two Isurim, and not from Eshes Ach, which has only one.</p></div>
<div class="subject"><span class="nm">2)</span><p>ALEHA IS NOT NEEDED TO FORBID ERVAH</p></div>
<div class="indent1"><span class="nm">(a)</span><p><span class="cl">Answer #5 (to Question 5:b - Rava):</span> We do not need a verse to forbid the Ervah, for an Aseh does not override a Lav with Kares;</p></div>
<div class="indent2"><span class="nm">1.</span><p>Aleha is needed to forbid the Tzarah.</p></div>
<div class="indent1"><span class="nm">(b)</span><p><span class="cl">Question:</span> We need a verse to teach that the Ervah is forbidden!</p></div>
<div class="indent2"><span class="nm">1.</span><p><span class="cl">(Beraisa):</span> 'This only teaches me about her (the Ervah)... '</p></div>
<div class="indent1"><span class="nm">(c)</span><p><span class="cl">Answer:</span> This was said only to show the source of the Isur of the Tzarah.</p></div>
<div class="indent1"><span class="nm">(d)</span><p><span class="cl">Question (Beraisa):</span> 'This only teaches about them (the Arayos)... '</p></div>
<div class="indent1"><span class="nm">(e)</span><p><span class="cl">Answer:</span> This was said only to show the source of the Isur of their Tzaros.</p></div>
<div class="indent1"><span class="nm">(f)</span><p><span class="cl">Question (Beraisa - Rebbi):</span> "He will take <i>her</i> and do Yibum <i>(to) her</i>" - these (exclude, and thereby) forbid Tzaros and Arayos.</p></div>
<div class="indent1"><span class="nm">(g)</span><p><span class="cl">Answer:</span> It should say 'the Tzaros <i>of</i> Arayos.'</p></div>
<div class="indent1"><span class="nm">(h)</span><p><span class="cl">Question:</span> Two words were expounded (surely, we learn two laws)!</p></div>
<div class="indent2"><span class="nm">1.</span><p><span class="cl">Suggestion:</span> One teaches about the Ervah, and one about the Tzarah!</p></div>
<div class="indent1"><span class="nm">(i)</span><p><span class="cl">Answer:</span> No, both teach about the Tzarah. One forbids her in the situation of Yibum, and one permits her not in the situation of Yibum.</p></div>
<div class="indent2"><span class="nm">1.</span><p><span class="cl">Question:</span> How do we know this?</p></div>
<div class="indent2"><span class="nm">2.</span><p><span class="cl">Answer:</span> "He will do Yibum <i>(to) her</i>" - the Isur (of the Tzarah) is only in the situation of Yibum.</p></div>
<div class="indent1"><span class="nm">(j)</span><p><span class="cl">(Rav Ashi):</span> The Mishnah supports Rava.</p></div>
<div class="indent2"><span class="nm">1.</span><p>It teaches that 15 Arayos exempt their Tzaros. It does not need to say that the Arayos themselves are exempt!</p></div>
<div class="indent1"><span class="nm">(k)</span><p><span class="cl">Question:</span> Surely, Ervah does not require a verse because an Aseh does not override a Lav with Kares. Similarly, we do not need "Aleha" to forbid the Tzarah ("Litzror" forbids her like Ervah, and there is Kares for all Arayos).</p></div>
<div class="subject"><span class="nm">3)</span><p>ALEHA PERMITS THE TZARAH OUTSIDE OF YIBUM</p></div>
<div class="indent1"><span class="nm">(a)</span><p><span class="cl">Answer: (Rav Acha bar Bivi):</span> Indeed, Rava does not use "Aleha" to forbid the Tzarah, rather, to permit her when there was no fall to Yibum!</p></div>
<div class="bbbline">8b----------------------------------------8b</p></div>
<div class="indent1"><span class="nm">(b)</span><p><span class="cl">Question:</span> How do we learn this?</p></div>
<div class="indent1"><span class="nm">(c)</span><p><span class="cl">Answer #1:</span> It says "(Litzror) Aleha" - she is prohibited only in the situation of "(Yevamah Yavo) Aleha".</p></div>
<div class="indent1"><span class="nm">(d)</span><p><span class="cl">Question (Rami bar Chama):</span> Perhaps the Ervah herself is permitted not in the situation of Yibum!</p></div>
<div class="indent1"><span class="nm">(e)</span><p><span class="cl">Answer (Rava):</span> A Kal va'Chomer refutes this. Ervah is forbidden even in the situation of Yibum, all the more so when there is no Mitzvah!</p></div>
<div class="indent1"><span class="nm">(f)</span><p><span class="cl">Question (Rami bar Chama):</span> The Tzarah disproves this. She is forbidden in the situation of Yibum, and otherwise permitted!</p></div>
<div class="indent1"><span class="nm">(g)</span><p><span class="cl">Answer (Rava):</span> The Torah wrote "In her lifetime" to disprove this reasoning. She (Achos Ishto, the wife's sister) is forbidden in her (the wife's) entire lifetime.</p></div>
<div class="indent1"><span class="nm">(h)</span><p><span class="cl">Question:</span> We need this verse to permit Achos Ishto after the wife dies!</p></div>
<div class="indent1"><span class="nm">(i)</span><p><span class="cl">Answer:</span> That is learned from "Ishah <i>El</i> Achosah" (she is forbidden only when they are together;</p></div>
<div class="indent1"><span class="nm">(j)</span><p><span class="cl">Objection:</span> Had it written only this, one might have thought that she is permitted after the wife is divorced. Therefore, also "In her lifetime" is needed!</p></div>
<div class="indent1"><span class="nm">(k)</span><p><span class="cl">Answer #2 (Rav Huna bar Tachlifa) - Question:</span> It says "Ishah El Achosah Lo Sikach <i>Litzror</i>" (both are forbidden). The verse concludes "Legalos Ervasah (singular)."</p></div>
<div class="indent2"><span class="nm">1.</span><p><span class="cl">Answer:</span> Both are forbidden in a situation of Yibum. Elsewhere, the Ervah is forbidden and the Tzarah is permitted.</p></div>
<div class="indent1"><span class="nm">(l)</span><p><span class="cl">Question:</span> Perhaps in a situation of Yibum, the Ervah is forbidden and the Tzarah is permitted, and elsewhere, they are both forbidden!</p></div>
<div class="indent1"><span class="nm">(m)</span><p><span class="cl">Answer:</span> If so, the Torah would have omitted "Aleha".</p></div>
<div class="indent1"><span class="nm">(n)</span><p><span class="cl">Question (Rav Ashi):</span> How do we know that "Aleha" forbids? Perhaps it permits!</p></div>
<div class="indent2"><span class="nm">1.</span><p>"Ishah El Achosah Lo Sikach" forbids both, not in the situation of Yibum. Regarding Yibum, both are permitted!</p></div>
<div class="indent1"><span class="nm">(o)</span><p><span class="cl">Answer:</span> If so, we could not fulfill "Legalos Ervasah (singular)";</p></div>
<div class="indent2"><span class="nm">1.</span><p>In the situation of Yibum, both are permitted. Not in the situation of Yibum, both are forbidden!</p></div>
<div class="subject"><span class="nm">4)</span><p>REBBI'S DERASHAH</p></div>
<div class="indent1"><span class="nm">(a)</span><p><span class="cl">(Beraisa - Rebbi):</span> "He will take <i>her</i> and do Yibum <i>(to) her</i>" - these (exclude, and thereby) forbid Tzaros and Arayos.</p></div>
<div class="indent1"><span class="nm">(b)</span><p><span class="cl">Question #1:</span> The verse does not discuss Tzaros and Arayos!</p></div>
<div class="indent1"><span class="nm">(c)</span><p><span class="cl">Question #2:</span> We derive Tzaros from Litzror!</p></div>
<div class="indent1"><span class="nm">(d)</span><p><span class="cl">Answer (to Question #2):</span> Rebbi uses Litzror for R. Shimon's teaching (28b, that two sisters who fall to Yibum (from different brothers) are exempt).</p></div>
<div class="indent1"><span class="nm">(e)</span><p><span class="cl">Answer (to Question #1):</span> It says "He will take <i>her</i>" to teach that when there are two women to be taken (Yevamos), and the Yavam can take whichever he wants, they are permitted. If not, both are forbidden.</p></div>
<div class="indent1"><span class="nm">(f)</span><p>"He will do Yibum <i>(to) her</i>" - in the situation of Yibum, the Tzarah is forbidden. Elsewhere, she is permitted.</p></div>
<div class="indent1"><span class="nm">(g)</span><p><span class="cl">Question:</span> What do Chachamim learn from "He will take <i>her</i>"?</p></div>
<div class="indent1"><span class="nm">(h)</span><p><span class="cl">Answer:</span> This teaches R. Yosi bar Chanina's law, that (after Yibum) the Yavam can divorce her with a Get (document) and (if he wants) remarry her;</p></div>
<div class="indent2"><span class="nm">1.</span><p>"He will do Yibum <i>(to) her</i>" teaches that he may do so against her will.</p></div>
<div class="indent1"><span class="nm">(i)</span><p>Rebbi learns R. Yosi bar Chanina's law from "For a wife". He learns that Yibum works against her will from "Yevamah Yavo Aleha". (Malbim - elsewhere the Torah discusses Bi'ah <i>El</i> Ishah, denoting equality. Here it says Aleha, to show that he is dominant.)</p></div>
<div class="indent1"><span class="nm">(j)</span><p><span class="cl">Question:</span> What does Rebbi learn from Aleha?</p></div>
<div class="indent1"><span class="nm">(k)</span><p><span class="cl">Answer (Beraisa):</span> Beis Din brings Par Helam Davar (a Korban for a mistaken ruling which caused most of Yisrael to transgress) only if they permitted something punishable by Kares if done b'Mezid, and Chatas if (an individual did it b'Shogeg);</p></div>
<div class="indent2"><span class="nm">1.</span><p>Likewise, a Kohen (Gadol) Mashi'ach (anointed with Shemen ha'Mishchah) brings a Par only for a transgression due to such a mistake.</p></div>
<div class="indent2"><span class="nm">2.</span><p>Also, they bring for a mistaken ruling about idolatry only for something punishable by Kares b'Mezid and Chatas b'Shogeg.</p></div>
