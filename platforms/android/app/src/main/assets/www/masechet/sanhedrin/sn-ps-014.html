<p class="bas subject"><span class="nm">1)</span>CONDITIONS FOR GIVING SEMICHAH</p>
<p class="bas indent1"><span class="nm">(a)</span><span class="cl">Question:</span> Is it really true that one cannot give Semichah?!</p>
<p class="bas indent2"><span class="nm">1.</span>Rav Yehudah taught that if not for R. Yehudah ben Bava, fines would have been forgotten from Yisrael;</p>
<p class="bas indent2"><span class="nm">2.</span><span class="cl">Objection:</span> Why would they be forgotten? Chachamim should teach them!</p>
<p class="bas indent2"><span class="nm">3.</span><span class="cl">Correction:</span> Rather, they would not have been enforced, for Romi decreed to kill anyone who gives Semichah or receives Semichah, and to destroy the city and its outskirts where Semichah was given;</p>
<p class="bas indent2"><span class="nm">4.</span>R. Yehudah ben Bava went between two mountains, between two cities, between their outskirts, and gave Semichah to R. Meir, R. Yehudah, R. Yosi, R. Shimon, and R. Elazar ben Shamu'a (Rav Avya adds, also R. Nechemyah). (They lived long after the Sanhedrin was exiled, and they collected fines!)</p>
<p class="bas indent2"><span class="nm">5.</span>When the troops of Romi found out, R. Yehudah ben Bava told them 'flee. I will remain here.' They pierced him with 300 iron spears.</p>
<p class="bas indent1"><span class="nm">(b)</span><span class="cl">Answer:</span> There were other (less important) judges with him. They were not mentioned, to show honor to R. Yehudah ben Bava.</p>
<p class="bas indent1"><span class="nm">(c)</span><span class="cl">Question:</span> Did R. Yehudah ben Bava really give Semichah to R. Meir?!</p>
<p class="bas indent2"><span class="nm">1.</span><span class="cl">(Rabah bar bar Chanah):</span> R. Akiva gave Semichah to R. Meir.</p>
<p class="bas indent1"><span class="nm">(d)</span><span class="cl">Answer:</span> R. Akiva was Somech him, but he did not accept it (because he was not yet married). R. Yehudah ben Bava was Somech him, and he accepted it.</p>
<p class="bas indent1"><span class="nm">(e)</span><span class="cl">(R. Yehoshua ben Levi):</span> Semichah does not apply in Chutz la'Aretz.</p>
<p class="bas indent1"><span class="nm">(f)</span><span class="cl">Question:</span> What does this mean?</p>
<p class="bas indent2"><span class="nm">1.</span><span class="cl">Suggestion:</span> Fines cannot be judged at all in Chutz la'Aretz.</p>
<p class="bas indent2"><span class="nm">2.</span><span class="cl">Rejection (Mishnah):</span> Sanhedriyos (with authority even to kill) apply in Eretz Yisrael and Chutz la'Aretz.</p>
<p class="bas indent1"><span class="nm">(g)</span><span class="cl">Answer:</span> We do not give Semichah in Chutz la'Aretz.</p>
<p class="bas indent1"><span class="nm">(h)</span>The following is obvious. If the judges giving Semichah are in Chutz la'Aretz and the ones receiving Semichah are in Eretz Yisrael, this is invalid. We do not give Semichah in Chutz la'Aretz!</p>
<p class="bas indent1"><span class="nm">(i)</span><span class="cl">Question:</span> If the judges giving Semichah are in Eretz Yisrael and the ones receiving Semichah are in Chutz la'Aretz, what is the law?</p>
<p class="bas indent1"><span class="nm">(j)</span><span class="cl">Answer:</span> We may learn from R. Yochanan. He sorely wanted to be Somech R. Shemen bar Aba, but (he was unable, for) he never had two judges with him when R. Shemen was present.</p>
<p class="bas indent2"><span class="nm">1.</span>One of R. Shimon ben Zirud and R. Yonason ben Achmai was with R. Yochanan, and he received Semichah. The other was not with him, and did not get Semichah.</p>
<p class="bas indent1"><span class="nm">(k)</span>R. Yochanan was very pained that he could not be Somech R. Chanina and R. Oshiya. They told him 'don't feel bad. We are from Beis Eli';</p>
<p class="bas indent2"><span class="nm">1.</span><span class="cl">(R. Shmuel bar Nachman):</span> We are not Somech Chachamim from Beis Eli - "v'Lo Yihyeh Zaken b'Veisecha Kol ha'Yamim."</p>
<p class="bas indent2"><span class="nm">2.</span><span class="cl">Question:</span> What does 'Zaken' refer to?</p>
<p class="bas indent3"><span class="nm">i.</span><span class="cl">Suggestion:</span> It refers to someone old (all his descendants will die young).</p>
<p class="bas indent3"><span class="nm">ii.</span><span class="cl">Rejection:</span> Another verse teaches this - "v'Chol Marbis Beisecha Yamusu Anashim"!</p>
<p class="bas indent2"><span class="nm">3.</span><span class="cl">Answer:</span> Rather, they will not get Semichah.</p>
<p class="bas indent1"><span class="nm">(l)</span>R. Zeira was evading receiving Semichah due to R. Elazar's teaching.</p>
<p class="bas indent2"><span class="nm">1.</span><span class="cl">(R. Elazar):</span> One should live in obscurity, for then he will live a long time.</p>
<p class="bas indent1"><span class="nm">(m)</span>When he heard the following teaching of R. Elazar, he sought to get Semichah.</p>
<p class="bas indent2"><span class="nm">1.</span><span class="cl">(R. Elazar):</span> One does not receive a position of importance until all his transgressions are forgiven.</p>
<p class="bas indent1"><span class="nm">(n)</span>When R. Zeira received Semichah, they sang 'he is like a Kalah who bears grace without make-up.'</p>
<p class="bas indent1"><span class="nm">(o)</span>When R. Ami and R. Asi received Semichah they sang 'we should always be Somech Chachamim like these, and not those who switch (from the true law), those who give rulings without reason, those who refrain from giving the reasons, or empty people.'</p>
<p class="bas indent1"><span class="nm">(p)</span>When R. Avahu would come to the Kaiser's house after learning, the women would come out and sing 'a teacher and leader of his nation, a source of light. Blessed is your coming!'</p>
<p class="bas subject"><span class="nm">2)</span>EGLAH ARUFAH</p>
<p class="bas indent1"><span class="nm">(a)</span><span class="cl">(Mishnah - R. Shimon):</span> Three judges are needed for Eglah Arufah (the beheaded calf).</p>
<p class="bas indent1"><span class="nm">(b)</span><span class="cl">(Beraisa - R. Yehudah):</span> "V'Yotz'u Zekenecha v'Shofetecha" - 'Zekenecha' teaches two judges, and 'Shofetecha' teaches two. We do not make a Beis Din with an even number of judges, so we add a fifth;</p>
<p class="bas indent1"><span class="nm">(c)</span>R. Shimon says, 'Zekenecha' teaches two. We add a third to make an odd number.</p>
<p class="bas indent1"><span class="nm">(d)</span><span class="cl">Question:</span> What does R. Shimon learn from 'Shofetecha'?</p>
<p class="bas indent1"><span class="nm">(e)</span><span class="cl">Answer:</span> They must be the most special judges, i.e. from the Great Sanhedrin.</p>
<p class="bas indent2"><span class="nm">1.</span>R. Yehudah says, it says "Zekenecha" instead of 'Ziknei' to teach that they must be the most special.</p>
<p class="bas indent2"><span class="nm">2.</span>R. Shimon says, had it said Ziknei, this would connote plain Chachamim (who are not on a Sanhedrin). He said only 'Zekenecha', this would connote Chachamim of a regular Sanhedrin;</p>
<p class="bas indent3"><span class="nm">i.</span>'Shofetecha' teaches that they must be from the Great Sanhedrin.</p>
<p class="bas indent2"><span class="nm">3.</span>R. Yehudah learns a Gezerah Shavah "Ziknei-Ziknei" from "v'Somchu Ziknei ha'Edah" (on the Par He'elem Davar). Just like those are the most special of the congregation, also these are the most special Zekenim.</p>
<p class="bas indent2"><span class="nm">4.</span><span class="cl">Objection:</span> If we learn from there, we should also learn five judges from there! (Why must we learn from "Zekenecha v'Shofetecha"?)</p>
<p class="bas indent1"><span class="nm">(f)</span><span class="cl">Retraction:</span> Rather, R. Yehudah does not learn a Gezerah Shavah. He learns like R. Shimon, but he learns another two judges from the 'Vov' in '<i>v</i>'Shofetecha';</p>
<p class="bas indent2"><span class="nm">1.</span>R. Shimon does not expound the 'Vov'.</p>
<p class="bas indent1"><span class="nm">(g)</span><span class="cl">Question:</span> If every plural word teaches two judges, we should learn another two from "v'Yotz'u", and two more from "u'Modedu"! (R. Yehudah should require nine judges, and R. Shimon should require seven.)</p>
<p class="bas indent1"><span class="nm">(h)</span><span class="cl">Answer:</span> "V'Yotz'u" and "u'Modedu" teach other laws;</p>
<p class="bas indent2"><span class="nm">1.</span><span class="cl">(Beraisa):</span> "V'Yotz'u" - the judges themselves, and not their Sheluchim. "U'Modedu" - even if it is blatantly clear which city is closest, they must measure.</p>
<p class="bas bbbline">14b----------------------------------------14b</p>
<p class="bas indent1"><span class="nm">(i)</span>Our Mishnah is not like R. Eliezer ben Yakov.</p>
<p class="bas indent2"><span class="nm">1.</span><span class="cl">(Beraisa - R. Eliezer ben Yakov):</span> "V'Yotz'u Zekenecha v'Shofetecha" - 'Zekenecha' refers to the Sanhedrin;</p>
<p class="bas indent2"><span class="nm">2.</span>'Shofetecha' refers to the king ("Melech <i>b'Mishpat</i> Ya'amid Aretz") and the Kohen Gadol ("U'Vasa El ha'Kohanim...  <i>ha'Shofet</i>).</p>
<p class="bas indent1"><span class="nm">(j)</span><span class="cl">Question:</span> Surely, R. Eliezer ben Yakov argues about the king and Kohen Gadol;</p>
<p class="bas indent2"><span class="nm">1.</span>Does he also argue about the Sanhedrin (and require all of them to go), or does he hold like R. Yehudah or R. Shimon?</p>
<p class="bas indent1"><span class="nm">(k)</span><span class="cl">Answer (Rav Yosef - Beraisa) Suggestion:</span> If a Chacham found the Great Sanhedrin near Beis Pagi (a place inside the wall of Yerushalayim) and opposed their ruling, perhaps this is considered rebellion (and can lead to becoming a Zaken Mamrei)!</p>
<p class="bas indent2"><span class="nm">1.</span><span class="cl">Rejection:</span> "V'Kamta v'Alisa El ha'Makom" - Zaken Mamrei applies only when the Great Sanhedrin is in its proper place.</p>
<p class="bas indent2"><span class="nm">2.</span><span class="cl">Question:</span> How many of the Sanhedrin were near Beis Pagi?</p>
<p class="bas indent3"><span class="nm">i.</span><span class="cl">Suggestion:</span> Some of them were there.</p>
<p class="bas indent3"><span class="nm">ii.</span><span class="cl">Rejection:</span> If so, surely he is not a Zaken Mamrei. Perhaps the others would agree with him!</p>
<p class="bas indent2"><span class="nm">3.</span><span class="cl">Answer:</span> We must say that all of them were there.</p>
<p class="bas indent2"><span class="nm">4.</span><span class="cl">Question:</span> Why did they leave (Lishkas ha'Gazis)?</p>
<p class="bas indent3"><span class="nm">i.</span><span class="cl">Suggestion:</span> They left for an optional matter.</p>
<p class="bas indent3"><span class="nm">ii.</span><span class="cl">Rejection:</span> "...Al Yechsar ha'Mezeg" - one may not leave the Great Sanhedrin unless 23 judges remain.</p>
<p class="bas indent2"><span class="nm">5.</span><span class="cl">Answer:</span> Surely, they left for a Mitzvah.</p>
<p class="bas indent2"><span class="nm">6.</span><span class="cl">Suggestion:</span> They left to measure for Eglah Arufah. R. Eliezer ben Yakov taught this!</p>
<p class="bas indent1"><span class="nm">(l)</span><span class="cl">Rejection (Abaye):</span> No, they left to add onto Yerushalayim or the Azaros (courtyards of the Mikdash).</p>
<p class="bas indent2"><span class="nm">1.</span><span class="cl">(Mishnah):</span> Seventy-one judges are needed to add to Yerushalayim or the Azaros.</p>
<p class="bas indent1"><span class="nm">(m)</span><span class="cl">Support (for Rav Yosef - Beraisa) Suggestion:</span> If a Chacham found the Great Sanhedrin near Beis Pagi and opposed their ruling, e.g. they left to measure for Eglah Arufah or to add onto Yerushalayim or the Azaros, perhaps this is considered rebellion!</p>
<p class="bas indent2"><span class="nm">1.</span><span class="cl">Rejection:</span> "V'Kamta v'Alisa El ha'Makom" - Zaken Mamrei applies only when the Great Sanhedrin is in its proper place.</p>
<p class="bas subject"><span class="nm">3)</span>REDEMPTION OF MA'ASER SHENI</p>
<p class="bas indent1"><span class="nm">(a)</span><span class="cl">(Mishnah):</span> Three judges are needed for redemption of Ma'aser Sheni or Neta Revai whose value is not known.</p>
<p class="bas indent1"><span class="nm">(b)</span><span class="cl">(Beraisa) Question:</span> What is Ma'aser Sheni whose value is not known?</p>
<p class="bas indent1"><span class="nm">(c)</span><span class="cl">Answer:</span> It is rotten fruit, spoiled wine or rusted coins.</p>
<p class="bas indent1"><span class="nm">(d)</span><span class="cl">(Beraisa):</span> Three buyers (merchants who know prices well; some say, bidders (the highest bidder will buy the Ma'aser)) are needed for redemption of Ma'aser Sheni whose value is not known. Non-buyers do not suffice.</p>
<p class="bas indent2"><span class="nm">1.</span>One of them can be a Nochri, and one of them can be the owner.</p>
<p class="bas indent1"><span class="nm">(e)</span><span class="cl">Question (R. Yirmeyah):</span> Can they be three partners?</p>
<p class="bas indent1"><span class="nm">(f)</span><span class="cl">Answer (Beraisa):</span> A man and his two wives can redeem Ma'aser Sheni whose value is not known.</p>
<p class="bas indent1"><span class="nm">(g)</span><span class="cl">Rejection:</span> Perhaps that refers to wives (who are financially independent,) like Aba Sura's daughter (Rav Papa's wife).</p>
<p class="bas indent1"><span class="nm">(h)</span><span class="cl">(Mishnah):</span> Three are required to redeem Hekdesh.</p>
<p class="bas indent1"><span class="nm">(i)</span>Our Mishnah is not like R. Eliezer ben Yakov.</p>
<p class="bas indent2"><span class="nm">1.</span><span class="cl">(Beraisa - R. Eliezer ben Yakov):</span> Ten are required to redeem even a tiny fork of Hekdesh.</p>
<p class="bas indent1"><span class="nm">(j)</span><span class="cl">Question (Rav Papa):</span> Granted, R. Eliezer ben Yakov learns like Shmuel.</p>
<p class="bas indent2"><span class="nm">1.</span><span class="cl">(Shmuel):</span> There are 10 mentions of Kohanim in the Parshiyos of Erchin (pledging to Hekdesh a sum of money based on a person's age and gender) and redemption of (Metaltelim and land of) Hekdesh. (Vayikra 27:1-25. He does not count "Kohen" written in verse 21, which is for a mere comparison, and does not discuss a Kohen involved in Erchin or redemption. Similarly, we count 39 "Melachos" in the Torah, and exclude those that do not discuss doing work - Shabbos 49b.)</p>
<p class="bas indent2"><span class="nm">2.</span>However, what is the Chachamim's source to require three?</p>
<p class="bas indent2"><span class="nm">3.</span><span class="cl">Suggestion:</span> There are three mentions of Kohanim in the Parshah of redemption of Metaltelim.</p>
<p class="bas indent2"><span class="nm">4.</span><span class="cl">Objection:</span> If so, four should suffice for redemption of  land, for there are four mentions of Kohanim in the Parshah of redemption of land!</p>
<p class="bas indent3"><span class="nm">i.</span><span class="cl">Suggestion:</span> Perhaps that is Chachamim's opinion!</p>
<p class="bas indent3"><span class="nm">ii.</span><span class="cl">Rejection (Mishnah):</span> Redemption of land requires nine people and a Kohen.</p>
<p class="bas indent2"><span class="nm">5.</span><span class="cl">Answer:</span> The Parshah of redemption of land concludes [the Parshiyos of Erchin and redemption], in which there are in all 10 mentions of Kohanim.</p>
<p class="bas indent2"><span class="nm">6.</span><span class="cl">Rejection:</span> If so, we should require six to redeem Metaltelim, for (it concludes (follows) the Parshah of Erchin, and in all) there are six mentions of Kohanim.</p>
<p class="bas indent1"><span class="nm">(k)</span>This is left difficult.</p>
<p class="bas subject"><span class="nm">4)</span>ERCHIN HA'METALTELIM</p>
<p class="bas indent1"><span class="nm">(a)</span><span class="cl">(Mishnah):</span> Erchin (ha'Metaltelim require three).</p>
