<p class="bas indent1"><span class="nm">(a)</span><span class="cl">Question:</span> Why did he wait?</p>
<p class="bas indent2"><span class="nm">1.</span><span class="cl">Suggestion:</span> He wanted to see if there was another Tana who forbids benefit from it, like R. Noson. (If so, he would forbid benefit from it.)</p>
<p class="bas indent3"><span class="nm">i.</span><span class="cl">(Beraisa):</span> If a Nochri measured (the depth of) wine by sticking in his hand or foot, one may sell the wine;</p>
<p class="bas indent3"><span class="nm">ii.</span>R. Noson says, if he stuck his hand in, one may not benefit from it. If he used his foot, one may sell it.</p>
<p class="bas indent2"><span class="nm">2.</span><span class="cl">Rejection:</span> R. Noson forbids benefit only when he used his hand, but not when he used his foot!</p>
<p class="bas indent1"><span class="nm">(b)</span><span class="cl">Answer:</span> He wanted to see if there was another Tana who permits drinking it, like R. Shimon (in the Mishnah (60b). If so, he would permit drinking it.)</p>
<p class="bas indent1"><span class="nm">(c)</span>A Nochri climbed a date tree and took a Lulav. On his way down, the end of the Lulav (our text; R. Tam - he) accidentally touched wine.</p>
<p class="bas indent1"><span class="nm">(d)</span><span class="cl">Rav:</span> The wine may be sold to Nochrim.</p>
<p class="bas indent1"><span class="nm">(e)</span><span class="cl">Rav Kahana and R. Asi:</span> You yourself said that a one day old Nochri makes Yayin Nesech (if he touches wine, even though he has no intention)!</p>
<p class="bas indent1"><span class="nm">(f)</span><span class="cl">Rav:</span> I meant only that one may not drink it, but one may benefit from it.</p>
<p class="bas subject"><span class="nm">2)</span>WHICH 'NOCHRIM' MAKE 'YAYIN NESECH?'</p>
<p class="bas indent1"><span class="nm">(a)</span><span class="cl">Question (against Rav - Rav Simi bar Chiya - Beraisa):</span> If one bought slaves from a Nochri and they were circumcised but did not yet immerse, and similarly Bnei Shifchos (children of a Yisrael's female slave; she did not yet immerse to become a Shifchah Kena'anis) that were circumcised but did not yet immerse:</p>
<p class="bas indent2"><span class="nm">1.</span>Their spit and Medrasan (what they step on) are Teme'im (mid'Rabanan, they are like Zavim, even) in the market;</p>
<p class="bas indent2"><span class="nm">2.</span>Some say, their spit and Medrasan are Tehorim (the slaves are like <i>Safek</i> Zavim, therefore, they are not Metamei in Reshus ha'Rabim);</p>
<p class="bas indent2"><span class="nm">3.</span>Adults make Yayin Nesech, but children do not;</p>
<p class="bas indent3"><span class="nm">i.</span>'Adult' refers to one who knows idolatry well. 'Child' is one who does not.</p>
<p class="bas indent2"><span class="nm">4.</span><span class="cl">Summation of question:</span> It says that adults make Yayin Nesech, but children do not!</p>
<p class="bas indent1"><span class="nm">(b)</span><span class="cl">Answer:</span> The Seifa (that distinguishes children from adults) discusses Bnei Shifchos. (They will be raised in the Yisrael's house. Rav taught that a Stam Nochri child, who will be raised in a Nochri's house, makes Yayin Nesech.)</p>
<p class="bas indent1"><span class="nm">(c)</span><span class="cl">Question:</span> It says <i>similarly</i> (Bnei Shifchos... This implies that the law is the same as for slaves who did not yet immerse, i.e. Nochrim)!</p>
<p class="bas indent1"><span class="nm">(d)</span><span class="cl">Answer #1:</span> Their law is the same regarding Tum'ah (of their spit and Medrasan).</p>
<p class="bas indent1"><span class="nm">(e)</span><span class="cl">Question:</span> This is like the opinion that they (spit and Medrasan of Nochrim) are Teme'im;</p>
<p class="bas indent2"><span class="nm">1.</span>However, according to the opinion that they are Tehorim, how can we answer? (All the more so, spit and Medrasan of Bnei Shifchos are Tehorim, so the Beraisa need not teach this. Rather, 'similarly' teaches about Yayin Nesech!)</p>
<p class="bas indent1"><span class="nm">(f)</span><span class="cl">Answer #2:</span> It teaches that slaves born to Nochrim have the same law as Bnei Shifchos. They make Yayin Nesech before immersing, but not afterwards.</p>
<p class="bas indent2"><span class="nm">1.</span>This is unlike Rav Nachman.</p>
<p class="bas indent2"><span class="nm">2.</span><span class="cl">(Rav Nachman):</span> If one buys slaves from a Nochri, even after they are circumcised and immerse, they make Yayin Nesech until their (previous) connection to idolatry is forgotten.</p>
<p class="bas indent2"><span class="nm">3.</span><span class="cl">Question:</span> How long is this?</p>
<p class="bas indent2"><span class="nm">4.</span><span class="cl">Answer (R. Yehoshua ben Levi):</span> It is 12 months. (R. Tam (57b DH Le'afukei) - R. Yehoshua ben Levi said so about a different matter, and the same applies here.)</p>
<p class="bas indent1"><span class="nm">(g)</span><span class="cl">Question (against Rav Nachman - Rabah - Beraisa):</span> If one bought slaves from a Nochri and they were circumcised but did not yet immerse, and similarly Bnei Shifchos that were circumcised but did not yet immerse:</p>

<p class="bas indent1"><span class="nm">(h)</span><span class="cl">Answer:</span> This refers to Bnei Shifchos (they were born in the Yisrael's house. Regular slaves make Yayin Nesech for a year after immersion.)</p>

<p class="bas indent2"><span class="nm">1.</span>This argues with Rav.</p>

<p class="bas indent1"><span class="nm">(a)</span>A case occurred in which a Nochri entered Reuven's store and asked to buy wine.</p>

<p class="bas indent2"><span class="nm">2.</span>There was wine in a bucket. The Nochri inserted his hand, shook it and said 'this is not wine?!' Reuven angrily took it away and poured it into a barrel (containing more wine).</p>
<p class="bas indent1"><span class="nm">(b)</span><span class="cl">Rava:</span> (All) the wine may be sold to Nochrim.</p>
<p class="bas indent1"><span class="nm">(c)</span>Rav Huna bar Chinena and Rav Huna brei d'Rav Yehoshua: One may not benefit from it!</p>
<p class="bas indent2"><span class="nm">1.</span>Rava's Talmidim permitted it. The Talmidim of Rav Huna bar Chinena and Rav Huna brei d'Rav Yehoshua forbade it.</p>
