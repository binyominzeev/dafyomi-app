<p class="bas subject"><span class="nm">1)</span>DISPUTING THE LENGTH OF A RENTAL</p>
<p class="bas indent1"><span class="nm">(a)</span><span class="cl">Version #1 - Rashi - (Rava):</span> If Shimon has an undated document saying that Reuven rented a house to Shimon for ten years, and Reuven claims that five years have expired (and Shimon says that only three have expired), Reuven is believed.</p>
<p class="bas indent1"><span class="nm">(b)</span><span class="cl">Version #2 - Tosfos - (Rava):</span> If Reuven has a document saying that he rented a house to Shimon for ten years for 100 Dinarim, ten Dinarim per year, and five years have expired, and he claims that no rent was paid, and Shimon says that he had paid for the five years, Shimon is believed. (end of Version #2)</p>
<p class="bas indent1"><span class="nm">(c)</span><span class="cl">Question (Rav Acha mi'Difti):</span> Will we also say that if Reuven borrowed 100 Zuz with a document and says that he paid half, he is believed?!</p>
<p class="bas indent1"><span class="nm">(d)</span><span class="cl">Answer (Ravina):</span> That is different. A loan document is destined to be fully paid. If he paid half, he should have written so on the document itself, or gotten a receipt;</p>
<p class="bas indent2"><span class="nm">1.</span><span class="cl">Version #1 (Rashi):</span> Here, the document was written to publicize the rental, so Shimon cannot claim that he bought the house. (It is not to prove that he gets ten years from when he shows the document!)</p>
<p class="bas indent2"><span class="nm">2.</span><span class="cl">Version #2 (Tosfos):</span> Here, the document was written to prevent Shimon from claiming that he bought the house. (It is not to prove that he owes rent for all ten years!)</p>
<p class="bas subject"><span class="nm">2)</span>HOW GENEROUSLY DO PEOPLE LEND THINGS?</p>
<p class="bas indent1"><span class="nm">(a)</span><span class="cl">(Rav Nachman):</span> Reuven asked to borrow Shimon's Kli 'b'Tuvo (in its goodness)', and Shimon consented, Reuven can borrow it forever, whenever he needs it.</p>
<p class="bas indent1"><span class="nm">(b)</span><span class="cl">(Rav Mari brei d'Vas Shmuel):</span> This is if he made an acquisition. If not, (Rashi - if he returns it) he does not have permanent rights to it.</p>
<p class="bas indent1"><span class="nm">(c)</span><span class="cl">(Rav Mari brei d'Rav Ashi):</span> When it is no longer fitting to use, he returns the remnant (e.g. the handle of an axe).</p>
<p class="bas indent1"><span class="nm">(d)</span><span class="cl">(Rava):</span> If Reuven asked to borrow Shimon's shovel to dig in this orchard, he may dig in that orchard;</p>
<p class="bas indent2"><span class="nm">1.</span>If he borrowed to dig in an orchard, he may dig in any orchard he wants;</p>
<p class="bas indent2"><span class="nm">2.</span>If he borrowed to dig in 'Pardisai' (my orchards), he may dig in as many orchards as he has, even if he wears out the shovel.</p>
<p class="bas indent1"><span class="nm">(e)</span><span class="cl">(Rav Papa):</span> If Reuven asked Shimon 'lend to me <i>this</i> well (to irrigate my fields)', and it caved in, Reuven cannot say 'I will rebuild it and you must let me use the new one';</p>
<p class="bas indent2"><span class="nm">1.</span>If he asked 'lend to me <i>a</i> well', and it caved in, Reuven can rebuild it, and he may use it to irrigate all his fields (like before it caved in);</p>
<p class="bas indent2"><span class="nm">2.</span>If he asked 'lend to me place for a well', he may dig in as many places as needed until he finds water;</p>
<p class="bas indent3"><span class="nm">i.</span>He must make an acquisition. If not, Shimon can retract his promise.</p>
<p class="bas subject"><span class="nm">3)</span>REPLACING A RENTED HOUSE THAT FELL</p>
<p class="bas indent1"><span class="nm">(a)</span><span class="cl">(Mishnah):</span> If Reuven rented a house to Shimon and it fell, Reuven must provide for him another house.</p>
<p class="bas indent1"><span class="nm">(b)</span>If the first house was small, the replacement cannot be big, and vice-versa.</p>
<p class="bas indent1"><span class="nm">(c)</span>If he rented one house, he cannot replace it with two houses (of the same total size), and vice-versa.</p>
<p class="bas indent1"><span class="nm">(d)</span>The replacement cannot have more or fewer windows than the first house;</p>
<p class="bas indent2"><span class="nm">1.</span>All of these are permited only if both of them consent.</p>
<p class="bas indent1"><span class="nm">(e)</span><span class="cl">(Gemara) Question:</span> What is the case?</p>
<p class="bas indent2"><span class="nm">1.</span>If Reuven said 'I rent to you this house', it is gone (Reuven need not provide another)!</p>
<p class="bas indent2"><span class="nm">2.</span>If Reuven said 'I rent to you a house', why can't he provide two in place of one, or a big house in place of a small house?</p>
<p class="bas indent1"><span class="nm">(f)</span><span class="cl">Answer #1 (Reish Lakish):</span> The case is, he said 'I rent to you a house of such and such length and width' (he specified the dimensions).</p>
<p class="bas indent1"><span class="nm">(g)</span><span class="cl">Objection:</span> If so, this is obvious! (What is the Chidush?)</p>
<p class="bas indent1"><span class="nm">(h)</span><span class="cl">Correction (Ravin citing Reish Lakish):</span> The case is, he said 'I rent to you a house like this.</p>
<p class="bas indent1"><span class="nm">(i)</span><span class="cl">Question:</span> Also this is obvious! (The replacement must be similar to what he showed to him!)</p>
<p class="bas indent1"><span class="nm">(j)</span><span class="cl">Answer:</span> The case is, he showed to him a house on the riverbank. One might have thought that 'a house like this' means a house on the riverbank (but it need not have similar dimensions). The Mishnah teaches that this is not so.</p>
<p class="perekline">PEREK HA'MEKABEL</p>
<p class="bas subject"><span class="nm">4)</span>FOLLOWING THE LOCAL CUSTOM OF WORKERS</p>
<p class="bas indent1"><span class="nm">(a)</span><span class="cl">(Mishnah):</span> If Reuven accepted to work on Shimon's field (to receive a fixed portion of the Peros, like a sharecropper, or to rent it on condition to pay a fixed amount of Peros each year, like a Chocher, he follows the local customs, such as to reap (the grain, leaving the stalk) or to uproot (the entire stalk), or to plow after harvesting.</p>
<p class="bas indent1"><span class="nm">(b)</span>They share the straw just like they share the grain. They share the vines and reeds just like they share the wine;</p>
<p class="bas bbbline">103b----------------------------------------103b</p>
<p class="bas indent2"><span class="nm">1.</span>They both supply the reeds.</p>
<p class="bas indent1"><span class="nm">(c)</span><span class="cl">(Gemara - Beraisa):</span> Where the custom is to reap, he may not uproot, and vice-versa. Neither the owner nor worker can deviate from the custom without the other's consent.</p>
<p class="bas indent2"><span class="nm">1.</span>Where the custom is to reap, he may not uproot. The owner can say 'I want the stalks to remain to fertilize the land.' The worker can say 'I do not want to toil so much';</p>
<p class="bas indent2"><span class="nm">2.</span>Where the custom is to uproot, he may not reap. The owner can say 'I want the land to be clear.' The worker can say 'I need straw for my animals.'</p>
<p class="bas indent1"><span class="nm">(d)</span><span class="cl">Question:</span> Why must it say 'neither can deviate without the other's consent'? (It already said that the worker cannot reap or uproot against the custom. We already know that sometimes he prefers one, and sometimes the other, and likewise the owner!)</p>
<p class="bas indent1"><span class="nm">(e)</span><span class="cl">Answer:</span> The Beraisa gives the reason for the law. Because sometimes each prefers one way, neither can deviate without the other's consent.</p>
<p class="bas indent1"><span class="nm">(f)</span><span class="cl">(Mishnah):</span> Where the custom is to plow after harvesting, he must do so.</p>
<p class="bas indent1"><span class="nm">(g)</span><span class="cl">Objection:</span> This is obvious!</p>
<p class="bas indent1"><span class="nm">(h)</span><span class="cl">Answer:</span> It teaches about place in which people do not weed, and this worker weeded;</p>
<p class="bas indent2"><span class="nm">1.</span>One might have thought that he can say 'I weeded in order that I will not have to plow.'  The Mishnah teaches that he cannot say so now. It helps only if he said so before weeding (Me'iri - and the owner agreed; Ramah - and the owner did not object).</p>
<p class="bas indent1"><span class="nm">(i)</span><span class="cl">(Mishnah):</span> All is according to the local custom.</p>
<p class="bas indent1"><span class="nm">(j)</span><span class="cl">Question:</span> What does this come to include?</p>
<p class="bas indent1"><span class="nm">(k)</span><span class="cl">Answer (Beraisa):</span> In a place where trees on the field are included in the rental (even though they need very little work), if nothing was specified, they are included. In a place where trees are not included, (unless specified) they are not included.</p>
<p class="bas indent1"><span class="nm">(l)</span><span class="cl">Question:</span> Obviously, in a place where trees are included, we assume that they are included!</p>
<p class="bas indent1"><span class="nm">(m)</span><span class="cl">Answer:</span> The case is, the owner agreed to give the worker a larger share of the Peros than normal. One might have thought that this was on condition that the trees are not included. The Beraisa teaches that this is not so, because he did not stipulate.</p>
<p class="bas indent1"><span class="nm">(n)</span><span class="cl">(Beraisa):</span> In a place where trees are not included, they are not included.</p>
<p class="bas indent1"><span class="nm">(o)</span><span class="cl">Objection:</span> This is obvious!</p>
<p class="bas indent1"><span class="nm">(p)</span><span class="cl">Answer:</span> The case is, the worker agreed to take a smaller share of the Peros than normal. One might have thought that this was on condition that the trees are included. The Beraisa teaches that this is not so, because he did not stipulate.</p>
<p class="bas indent1"><span class="nm">(q)</span><span class="cl">(Mishnah):</span> They share the straw just like they share the grain.</p>
<p class="bas indent1"><span class="nm">(r)</span><span class="cl">(Rav Yosef):</span> In Bavel, the custom is that sharecroppers do not receive a portion of the straw.</p>
<p class="bas indent1"><span class="nm">(s)</span><span class="cl">Question:</span> What do we learn from this?</p>
<p class="bas indent1"><span class="nm">(t)</span><span class="cl">Answer:</span> If one person does so, we do not learn from him. He just happens to be generous.</p>
<p class="bas subject"><span class="nm">5)</span>RESPONSIBILITIES OF THE OWNER AND THE WORKER</p>
<p class="bas indent1"><span class="nm">(a)</span><span class="cl">Version #1 (Rav Yosef):</span> The custom is make a dirt wall around a field, and to add to the wall (make it higher), and to add a third time. The owner supplies all the dirt, and also posts to make a fence around the field;</p>
<p class="bas indent2"><span class="nm">1.</span>The worker supplies thorns for the fence.</p>
<p class="bas indent2"><span class="nm">2.</span>The general rule is, the owner supplies needs of basic guarding, and the worker supplies extra guarding.</p>
<p class="bas indent1"><span class="nm">(b)</span><span class="cl">(Rav Yosef):</span> The owner supplies the shovel, hoe, and the bucket or pouch for irrigating. The worker makes the irrigation ditch.</p>
<p class="bas indent1"><span class="nm">(c)</span><span class="cl">(Mishnah):</span> They share the vines and reeds just like they share the wine.</p>
<p class="bas indent1"><span class="nm">(d)</span><span class="cl">Question:</span> Which reeds are harvested from a vineyard?!</p>
<p class="bas indent1"><span class="nm">(e)</span><span class="cl">Answer (d'Vei R. Yanai):</span> These are smoothed reeds that were used to support the vines.</p>
<p class="bas indent1"><span class="nm">(f)</span><span class="cl">(Mishnah):</span> They both supply the reeds.</p>
<p class="bas indent1"><span class="nm">(g)</span><span class="cl">Objection:</span> This is obvious! (Since he gets a share, surely he also supplies!)</p>
<p class="bas indent1"><span class="nm">(h)</span><span class="cl">Answer:</span> The Mishnah gives the reason. They share the vines and reeds because they both supply the reeds.</p>
<p class="bas subject"><span class="nm">6)</span>GROUNDS FOR DEDUCTING FROM THE RENTAL FEE</p>
<p class="bas indent1"><span class="nm">(a)</span><span class="cl">(Mishnah):</span> If Reuven accepted to work on Shimon's Beis ha'Shelachin (a field that must be irrigated from a spring) or a Beis ha'Ilan (a field with a tree, which is profitable for the worker), and the spring dried up or the tree was cut down, Reuven does not deduct from the agreed rental;</p>
<p class="bas indent2"><span class="nm">1.</span>If he said 'Chakor Li (rent to me; Nimukei Yosef - rent from me) this Beis ha'Shelachin or Beis ha'Ilan', he deducts from the agreed rental.</p>
<p class="bas indent1"><span class="nm">(b)</span><span class="cl">(Gemara) Question:</span> What is the case (in which the spring dried up)?</p>
<p class="bas indent2"><span class="nm">1.</span>If a big river dried up, why doesn't he deduct? This affects the entire region (we cannot say that it is due to his bad Mazal)!</p>
<p class="bas indent1"><span class="nm">(c)</span><span class="cl">Answer (Rav Papa):</span> A small spring dried up. The worker could bring from the big river.</p>
