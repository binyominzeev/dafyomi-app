<div class="subject"><span class="nm">1)</span><p>A KORAH THAT DOES NOT REST ON THE WALLS OF THE MAVOY</p></div>
<div class="indent1"><span class="nm">(a)</span><p><span class="cl">Question (against both of them - R. Ada bar Masnah - Beraisa):</span> If the Korah was Mashuchah or suspended (these will be explained) less than three Tefachim [from the walls], it permits; [if it was at least] three Tefachim [away], another Korah is needed.</p></div>
<div class="indent2"><span class="nm">1.</span><p>R. Shimon ben Gamliel says, if it is less than four Tefachim, it permits. If not, it does not.</p></div>
<div class="indent2"><span class="nm">2.</span><p><span class="cl">Suggestion:</span> 'Mashuchah' is outside the Mavoy [on pegs sticking out of the walls]. 'Suspended' is inside [in the middle. It does not reach the sides of the Mavoy.]</p></div>
<div class="indent1"><span class="nm">(b)</span><p><span class="cl">Answer #1 (Rava):</span> No, both of these are inside. 'Mashuchah' does not reach one wall. 'Suspended' does not reach either wall;</p></div>
<div class="indent2"><span class="nm">1.</span><p>One might have thought that we apply Lavud to one side, but not to two. The Beraisa teaches that this is not so. (We apply Lavud to both sides.)</p></div>
<div class="indent1"><span class="nm">(c)</span><p><span class="cl">Answer #2 (Rav Ashi):</span> No, the Korah is Mashuchah <i>and</i> suspended.</p></div>
<div class="indent1"><span class="nm">(d)</span><p><span class="cl">Question:</span> What is the case?</p></div>
<div class="indent1"><span class="nm">(e)</span><p><span class="cl">Answer:</span> One inserted a bent peg on top of each side wall of a Mavoy [at the opening]; the pegs go straight up less than three Tefachim, then bend inwards less than three Tefachim [each] to face each other; a Korah rests on top of them. (See Perush Chai, Perek 1 diagram 98, and <a href=ev-ps-appendix.htm#3>see note 3 in Appendix</a>. We say Chavut Rami <i>and</i> Lavud. It is as if the Korah was banged down to the height of the walls <i>and</i> reaches to the walls.)</p></div>
<div class="indent2"><span class="nm">1.</span><p>One might have thought that [in any particular case] we say Chavut Rami <i>or</i> Lavud, but not both. The Beraisa teaches that we say both.</p></div>
<div class="subject"><span class="nm">2)</span><p>BEIN HA'LECHAYAYIM</p></div>
<div class="indent1"><span class="nm">(a)</span><p><span class="cl">(R. Zakai - Beraisa):</span> The following are Karmelis: Bein ha'Lechayayim (the area parallel to the middle wall and even with the thickness of the Lechi), and under the Korah.</p></div>
<div class="indent1"><span class="nm">(b)</span><p><span class="cl">R. Yochanan:</span> Do not teach this in the Beis Medrash!</p></div>
<div class="indent1"><span class="nm">(c)</span><p><span class="cl">(Abaye):</span> Presumably, R. Yochanan objected to under the Korah (he permits), but he agrees that Bein ha'Lechayayim is forbidden.</p></div>
<div class="indent1"><span class="nm">(d)</span><p><span class="cl">(Rava):</span> Also Bein ha'Lechayayim is permitted.</p></div>
<div class="indent1"><span class="nm">(e)</span><p><span class="cl">Support (Rava, for himself - Rav Dimi citing R. Yochanan):</span> If a place is not four by four [Tefachim], people in Reshus ha'Rabim or Reshus ha'Yachid may use it to unload, as long as they do not use it to transfer [from one Reshus to the other].</p></div>
<div class="indent1"><span class="nm">(f)</span><p><span class="cl">Rejection (Abaye):</span> That is when it is three Tefachim tall. (It stands out, but Bein ha'Lechayayim does not.)</p></div>
<div class="indent1"><span class="nm">(g)</span><p><span class="cl">Support (Abaye, for himself - Rav Chama bar Gurya citing Rav):</span> [If there is a pillar on each side of the opening of a Mavoy, the pillars count as Lechayayim;] the area between the pillars needs another Lechi [outside it] to permit it.</p></div>
<div class="indent2"><span class="nm">1.</span><p><span class="cl">Suggestion:</span> The case is, it is four by four (it itself is a Karmelis)!</p></div>
<div class="indent2"><span class="nm">2.</span><p><span class="cl">Rejection:</span> Rav Chanin bar Rava taught that Rav requires another Lechi to permit between the pillars even if it is not four by four.</p></div>
<div class="indent1"><span class="nm">(h)</span><p><span class="cl">Rejection (Rava):</span> That is when it is open to a Karmelis.</p></div>
<div class="indent1"><span class="nm">(i)</span><p><span class="cl">Question:</span> This implies that when it is open to Reshus ha'Rabim, it (between the pillars) is permitted [if less than four by four]. This is absurd! [Karmelis should not be more stringent than Reshus ha'Rabim.]</p></div>
<div class="indent1"><span class="nm">(j)</span><p><span class="cl">Answer:</span> It is reasonable. (It itself would be a Karmelis if it was big enough.) When it opens to a Reshus (Karmelis) like itself, it completes the Shi'ur.</p></div>
<div class="indent1"><span class="nm">(k)</span><p><span class="cl">Question (against Rava - Rav Huna brei d'Rav Yehoshua):</span> Rabah bar bar Chanah cited R. Yochanan to say that R. Shimon ben Gamliel and Chachamim argue about a Mavoy that has several Lechayayim (posts, from the opening towards the middle wall), successive Lechayayim are separated by [more than three but] less than four Tefachim of each other;</p></div>
<div class="indent2"><span class="nm">1.</span><p>R. Shimon ben Gamliel applies Lavud to a space up to four Tefachim [so all are considered like one long Lechi]. He permits [carrying] until the inner edge of the innermost Lechi. Chachamim do not apply Lavud [past three Tefachim, so the outermost Lechi stands by itself]. They permit until the inner edge of the outermost Lechi.</p></div>
<div class="indent2"><span class="nm">2.</span><p>All forbid Bein ha'Lechayayim!</p></div>
<div class="indent1"><span class="nm">(l)</span><p><span class="cl">Rejection #1 (Rava):</span> Also this is when it is open to a Karmelis.</p></div>
<div class="indent2"><span class="nm">1.</span><p><span class="cl">Question:</span> This implies that when it is open to a Reshus ha'Rabim it is permitted. This is absurd!</p></div>
<div class="indent2"><span class="nm">2.</span><p><span class="cl">Answer:</span> It is reasonable. When it opens to a Reshus like itself, it completes the Shi'ur.</p></div>
<div class="bbbline">9b----------------------------------------9b</p></div>
<div class="indent1"><span class="nm">(m)</span><p><span class="cl">Rejection #2 (Rav Ashi):</span> The case is, the Lechayayim extend for four Amos. R. Shimon applies Lavud, so it is like one Lechi that extends four Amos. It is not considered a Lechi, rather, a Mavoy [wall]. Therefore, another Lechi is needed to permit [next to] it;</p></div>
<div class="indent2"><span class="nm">1.</span><p>Chachamim do not apply Lavud, so no other Lechi is needed to permit it.</p></div>
<div class="subject"><span class="nm">3)</span><p>IS NIR'EH MIBA'CHUTZ V'SHAVAH MIBI'FNIM CONSIDERED A LECHI?</p></div>
<div class="indent1"><span class="nm">(a)</span><p><span class="cl">Question:</span> [We assume that the Lechi in the opening sticks out a bit from the Mavoy, like is typical. Even if we consider all the Lechayayim like a wall of the Mavoy,] R. Shimon should permit, just like [an addition to the wall that is] Nir'eh miba'Chutz v'Shavah mibi'Fnim (noticeable only from the outside - see Perush Chai diagram, Perek 1 number 111, in the <a href=../chai/eruv-1chai111.jpg>English Charts</a> section) is considered a Lechi!</p></div>
<div class="indent1"><span class="nm">(b)</span><p><span class="cl">Answer:</span> We discuss R. Yochanan's opinion. Ravin said that R. Yochanan does not consider Nir'eh miba'Chutz v'Shavah mibi'Fnim to be a Lechi.</p></div>
<div class="indent1"><span class="nm">(c)</span><p>Nir'eh mibi'Fnim v'Shavah miba'Chutz (it is noticeable only from the inside, like the second diagram in Rashi) is considered a Lechi;</p></div>
<div class="indent1"><span class="nm">(d)</span><p><span class="cl">(R. Chiya or R. Shimon b'Ribi):</span> Nir'eh miba'Chutz v'Shavah mibi'Fnim is considered a Lechi.</p></div>
<div class="indent1"><span class="nm">(e)</span><p><span class="cl">(The other of R. Chiya and R. Shimon b'Ribi):</span> It is not considered a Lechi.</p></div>
<div class="indent1"><span class="nm">(f)</span><p><span class="cl">Decision:</span> R. Chiya considers it like a Lechi:</p></div>
<div class="indent2"><span class="nm">1.</span><p><span class="cl">(R. Chiya - Beraisa #1):</span> If one side of [the thickness of] a wall is recessed from the other, whether it is Nir'eh miba'Chutz v'Shavah mibi'Fnim or Nir'eh mibi'Fnim v'Shavah miba'Chutz, it is considered a Lechi.</p></div>
<div class="indent2"><span class="nm">2.</span><p><span class="cl">Question:</span> Did R. Yochanan not hear this?! (Why does he oppose the Beraisa?)</p></div>
<div class="indent2"><span class="nm">3.</span><p><span class="cl">Answer:</span> He heard it, but disagrees with it. (He holds like Rav Ada's Beraisa at the end of this Daf.)</p></div>
<div class="indent1"><span class="nm">(g)</span><p><span class="cl">Rejection:</span> Perhaps also R. Chiya heard Beraisa #1, but disagrees with it!</p></div>
<div class="indent1"><span class="nm">(h)</span><p><span class="cl">Objection:</span> This is unreasonable! Granted, it is reasonable that R. Yochanan heard it, but disagrees with it. However, if R. Chiya disagreed with it, he would not teach it!</p></div>
<div class="indent1"><span class="nm">(i)</span><p><span class="cl">(Rabah bar Rav Huna):</span> Nir'eh miba'Chutz v'Shavah mibi'Fnim is considered a Lechi.</p></div>
<div class="indent1"><span class="nm">(j)</span><p><span class="cl">Question (Rabah):</span> A Mishnah seemingly refutes me!</p></div>
<div class="indent2"><span class="nm">1.</span><p><span class="cl">(Mishnah):</span> If a small Chatzer was breached to a big Chatzer, the big Chatzer is permitted, but the small Chatzer is forbidden, for it is like an opening of the big one [but not vice-versa].</p></div>
<div class="indent2"><span class="nm">2.</span><p>If Nir'eh miba'Chutz v'Shavah mibi'Fnim were considered a Lechi, also the small Chatzer should be permitted! (The remains of the wall of the outer Chatzer are visible from the outside.)</p></div>
<div class="indent1"><span class="nm">(k)</span><p><span class="cl">Answer (R. Zeira):</span> The case is, the walls of the small Chatzer extend into the big Chatzer (like the bottom right diagram in Rashi - nothing extends from them that could be considered a Lechi).</p></div>
<div class="indent1"><span class="nm">(l)</span><p><span class="cl">Question:</span> We should consider the protruding walls to extend to the sides of the big Chatzer through Lavud!</p></div>
<div class="indent2"><span class="nm">1.</span><p><span class="cl">Suggestion:</span> We do not because they are far (three or four Tefachim) from the side walls.</p></div>
<div class="indent2"><span class="nm">2.</span><p><span class="cl">Rejection (Rav Ada bar Avimi - Beraisa):</span> The small Chatzer is 10 [Amos wide], and the big Chatzer is 11. (It is only one Amah wider, i.e. three Tefachim on each side <i>minus</i> the thickness of the protruding walls.)</p></div>
<div class="indent1"><span class="nm">(m)</span><p><span class="cl">Answer (Ravina):</span> The small Chatzer is not centered, rather, its walls are four Tefachim from one side and two Tefachim from the other.</p></div>
<div class="indent1"><span class="nm">(n)</span><p><span class="cl">Question:</span> The wall that is only two Tefachim away is Lavud to the side. It should permit!</p></div>
