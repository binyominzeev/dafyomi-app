<p class="bas subject"><span class="nm">1)</span>THINGS DONE INDIRECTLY ON SHABBOS</p>
<p class="bas indent1"><span class="nm">(a)</span><span class="cl">(Mishnah):</span> One may not use his hand to move straw on a bed, but he may move it with his body;</p>
<p class="bas indent2"><span class="nm">1.</span>If the straw was food for animals, or if [before Shabbos] a sheet or blanket was spread over it (Rashi - and he slept on it; Rambam - it is as if he slept on it; Me'iri - the Mishnah discusses a normal case, normally one would not sleep directly on straw - the Heter depends only on sleeping), he may move it with his hand.</p>
<p class="bas indent1"><span class="nm">(b)</span>One may open a commoner's press (a pair of boards between which clothes are pressed), he may not close it [on clothes];</p>
<p class="bas indent1"><span class="nm">(c)</span>One may not touch a launderer's press.</p>
<p class="bas indent1"><span class="nm">(d)</span>Version #1 (our text) R. Yehudah says, if it was [slightly] open from before Shabbos, he may open it entirely and remove the garment.</p>
<p class="bas indent1"><span class="nm">(e)</span><span class="cl">Version #2 (Rosh' text):</span> R. Yehudah says, if it was open from before Shabbos, one may recognize his garment and remove it.</p>
<p class="bas indent1"><span class="nm">(f)</span><span class="cl">(Gemara - Rav Nachman):</span> One may remove radish that is partially in the ground only if it is right side up (for the top is wider, so he does not move earth when taking it), but not if it is upside down.</p>
<p class="bas indent1"><span class="nm">(g)</span><span class="cl">(Rav Ada bar Aba):</span> Our Mishnah opposes Rav Nachman!</p>
<p class="bas indent2"><span class="nm">1.</span><span class="cl">(Mishnah):</span> One may not use his hand to move straw on a bed, but he may move it with his body; if it was food for animals, or if a sheet or blanket was spread over it before Shabbos, he may move it with his hand.</p>
<p class="bas indent2"><span class="nm">2.</span>This teaches that Tiltul Min ha'Tzad (moving something indirectly) Lo Shmei Tiltul (is not considered moving it, it is permitted regarding Muktzeh. Surely, Rav Nachman knew the Mishnah - he held like Chachamim in a Beraisa (123 A).)</p>
<p class="bas indent1"><span class="nm">(h)</span><span class="cl">(Rav Yehudah):</span> One may crush peppers (Tosfos - on Shabbos; R. Chananel - on Yom Tov) one at a time using a knife handle; it is forbidden to crush two at a time.</p>
<p class="bas indent1"><span class="nm">(i)</span><span class="cl">(Rava):</span> Since he uses a Shinuy (a knife handle); he may crush many at a time.</p>
<p class="bas indent1"><span class="nm">(j)</span><span class="cl">(Rav Yehudah):</span> If one bathes in water (e.g. a river), he must dry himself well before returning, lest he carry water on his body four Amos in a Karmelis.</p>
<p class="bas indent1"><span class="nm">(k)</span><span class="cl">Question:</span> If so, it should be forbidden to descend into the water, for his Ko'ach (impetus) moves water four Amos in a Karmelis!</p>
<p class="bas indent1"><span class="nm">(l)</span><span class="cl">Answer:</span> Chachamim did not forbid [movement caused by] Ko'ach in a Karmelis.</p>
<p class="bas subject"><span class="nm">2)</span>CLEANING SHOES</p>
<p class="bas indent1"><span class="nm">(a)</span><span class="cl">(Abaye):</span> One may clean mud off his shoe [by rubbing it] on the ground, but not on a wall.</p>
<p class="bas indent1"><span class="nm">(b)</span><span class="cl">Objection (Rava):</span> Do you forbid on a wall because it looks like building - this is pitiful building!</p>
<p class="bas indent1"><span class="nm">(c)</span><span class="cl">(Rava):</span> Rather, one may clean his shoe on a wall, but not on the ground, lest he even out holes.</p>
<p class="bas indent1"><span class="nm">(d)</span><span class="cl">(Mar brei d'Ravina):</span> Both of these are forbidden.</p>
<p class="bas indent1"><span class="nm">(e)</span><span class="cl">(Rav Papa):</span> Both of them are permitted (one does not intend to build nor to even out holes - the Halachah follows R. Shimon regarding Davar she'Eino Miskaven. Tosfos - Rava forbids, lest one forget that it is Shabbos and intend to even out holes.)</p>
<p class="bas indent1"><span class="nm">(f)</span><span class="cl">Question:</span> According to Mar brei d'Ravina, how may one clean his shoe?</p>
<p class="bas indent1"><span class="nm">(g)</span><span class="cl">Answer:</span> He may clean them on a beam [lying on the ground].</p>
<p class="bas indent1"><span class="nm">(h)</span><span class="cl">(Rava):</span> One may not sit even with the Lechi (vertical post at the end of a Mavuy that permits carrying in the Mavuy), lest something fall from him and roll [outside the Mavuy], and he will retrieve it.</p>
<p class="bas indent1"><span class="nm">(i)</span><span class="cl">(Rava):</span> One may not tilt a [full] barrel to stand it up evenly, lest he even out holes in the ground.</p>
<p class="bas indent1"><span class="nm">(j)</span><span class="cl">(Rava):</span> One may not tightly pack tufts in the opening of a flask [with liquid], lest he come to squeeze.</p>
<p class="bas indent1"><span class="nm">(k)</span><span class="cl">(Rav Kahana):</span> If there is mud on one's garment, one may rub it from the inside, but not from the outside (it looks like laundering - it is not actual laundering, for there is no water).</p>
<p class="bas indent1"><span class="nm">(l)</span><span class="cl">Question (Beraisa):</span> If there is mud on one's shoe, one scrape it off with the back of a knife; if there is mud on one's garment, one may scrape it with his fingernail, as long as he does not rub it.</p>
<p class="bas indent2"><span class="nm">1.</span><span class="cl">Suggestion:</span> He may not rub it from the inside or outside!</p>
<p class="bas indent1"><span class="nm">(m)</span><span class="cl">Answer:</span> No, he may not rub it from the outside, only from the inside.</p>
<p class="bas indent1"><span class="nm">(n)</span><span class="cl">(R. Avahu citing R. Yanai):</span> One may scrape a new shoe, but not an old shoe (he would scrape the leather, this is Memachek).</p>
<p class="bas bbbline">141b----------------------------------------141b</p>
<p class="bas indent1"><span class="nm">(o)</span><span class="cl">Question:</span> What may he use to scrape it?</p>
<p class="bas indent1"><span class="nm">(p)</span><span class="cl">Answer (R. Avahu):</span> He may use the back of a knife.</p>
<p class="bas indent1"><span class="nm">(q)</span><span class="cl">Objection (an elder):</span> A Beraisa refutes you!</p>
<p class="bas indent2"><span class="nm">1.</span><span class="cl">(R. Chiya - Beraisa):</span> One may not scrape a new or old shoe; one may not anoint his foot with oil while it is in a shoe or sandal;</p>
<p class="bas indent2"><span class="nm">2.</span>One may anoint his foot with oil and then put it in a shoe or sandal.</p>
<p class="bas indent2"><span class="nm">3.</span>One may anoint his entire body with oil and roll himself on cooked hide [which will be used to cover a table or bed].</p>
<p class="bas indent2"><span class="nm">4.</span><span class="cl">(Rav Chisda):</span> This is permitted only if he intends to polish [the shoe or hide], not if he intends to tan it.</p>
<p class="bas indent2"><span class="nm">5.</span><span class="cl">Objection #1:</span> Obviously, he may not intend to tan!</p>
<p class="bas indent2"><span class="nm">6.</span><span class="cl">Objection #2:</span> No one would permit intending to polish it [lest one intend to tan it]!</p>
<p class="bas indent2"><span class="nm">7.</span><span class="cl">Correction (Rav Chisda):</span> It is permitted if there is an amount of oil to polish, not if there is enough to tan.</p>
<p class="bas subject"><span class="nm">3)</span>RESTRICTIONS CONCERNING SHOES ON SHABBOS</p>
<p class="bas indent1"><span class="nm">(a)</span><span class="cl">(Beraisa):</span> A small person may not go out with a big shoe (lest it fall and he will carry it), but he may go out with a big cloak;</p>
<p class="bas indent1"><span class="nm">(b)</span>A woman may not go out with a torn shoe (lest people mock her and she will carry it), it may not be used for Chalitzah - if it was used, the Chalitzah is Kosher.</p>
<p class="bas indent1"><span class="nm">(c)</span>One may not may go out with a new shoe;</p>
<p class="bas indent2"><span class="nm">1.</span>This is forbidden for a woman (lest she carry it if it does not fit very well).</p>
<p class="bas indent1"><span class="nm">(d)</span><span class="cl">(Bar Kapara - Beraisa):</span> It is forbidden only if she did not go out with it before Shabbos - if she did, it is permitted.</p>
<p class="bas indent1"><span class="nm">(e)</span><span class="cl">(Beraisa #1):</span> One may take a shoe off the mold [around which it is shaped];</p>
<p class="bas indent1"><span class="nm">(f)</span><span class="cl">Contradiction (Beraisa #2):</span> One may not take it off.</p>
<p class="bas indent1"><span class="nm">(g)</span><span class="cl">Resolution:</span> Beraisa #1 is Chachamim, Beraisa #2 is R. Eliezer:</p>
<p class="bas indent2"><span class="nm">1.</span><span class="cl">(Mishnah - R. Eliezer):</span> A shoe on a mold is Tahor (it is not a finished Kli);</p>
<p class="bas indent2"><span class="nm">2.</span>Chachamim say, it is Mekabel Tum'ah.</p>
<p class="bas indent1"><span class="nm">(h)</span><span class="cl">Question:</span> This is like Rava, who permits moving Kli she'Melachto l'Isur (the mold is used for making shoes) for [a permitted] use or for the sake of its place (he wants his foot to be where the mold is);</p>
<p class="bas indent2"><span class="nm">1.</span>But Abaye permits moving it to use it, but not for its place!</p>
<p class="bas indent1"><span class="nm">(i)</span><span class="cl">Answer:</span> The case is, it is loose (one need not move the mold to remove the shoe):</p>
<p class="bas indent2"><span class="nm">1.</span><span class="cl">(Beraisa - R. Yehudah):</span> If it is loose, it is permitted.</p>
<p class="bas indent2"><span class="nm">2.</span><span class="cl">Inference:</span> If it is not loose, it is forbidden.</p>
<p class="bas indent1"><span class="nm">(j)</span><span class="cl">Question:</span> This is like Abaye - but Rava permits moving Kli she'Melachto l'Isur even for its place, it should be permitted in either case!</p>
<p class="bas indent1"><span class="nm">(k)</span><span class="cl">Answer:</span> R. Yehudah explains R. Eliezer's opinion (he holds that a shoe on the mold is not a finished Kli):</p>
<p class="bas indent2"><span class="nm">1.</span><span class="cl">(Beraisa - R. Yehudah citing R. Eliezer):</span> If it is loose, it is permitted.</p>
<p class="perekline">PEREK NOTEL</p>
<p class="bas subject"><span class="nm">4)</span>CARRYING <i>ISUR</i> TOGETHER WITH <i>HETER</i> ON SHABBOS</p>
<p class="bas indent1"><span class="nm">(a)</span><span class="cl">(Mishnah):</span> One may carry a child holding a rock, or a basket with a rock inside;</p>
<p class="bas indent1"><span class="nm">(b)</span>One may move Tamei Terumah with Tahor Terumah or with Chulin;</p>
<p class="bas indent1"><span class="nm">(c)</span>(Meduma is a mixture of Terumah and Chulin. If there is least 100 times as much Chulin as Terumah, we Ma'aleh (remove) an amount equal to the Terumah, consider it to be Terumah, and the rest is permitted like Chulin.) R. Yehudah says, we may even Ma'aleh Meduma if there is at least 101 [volumes of mixture per volume of Terumah].</p>
<p class="bas indent1"><span class="nm">(d)</span><span class="cl">(Gemara - Rava):</span> If one was Motzi a live child with a wallet around his neck, he is liable for [Hotza'ah of] the wallet;</p>
<p class="bas indent2"><span class="nm">1.</span>If he was Motzi a dead child with a wallet around his neck, he is exempt.</p>
<p class="bas indent1"><span class="nm">(e)</span><span class="cl">Question:</span> In the first case, he should also be liable for the [live] child!</p>
<p class="bas indent1"><span class="nm">(f)</span><span class="cl">Answer:</span> Rava holds like R. Noson, who says ha'Chai Nosei Es Atzmo (carrying a living being is not a Melachah).</p>
<p class="bas indent1"><span class="nm">(g)</span><span class="cl">Question:</span> The wallet should be Batul to the child!</p>
<p class="bas indent2"><span class="nm">1.</span><span class="cl">(Mishnah):</span> If he was Motzi a live person in a bed, he is exempt even for the bed, for it is Batul to the person.</p>
<p class="bas indent1"><span class="nm">(h)</span><span class="cl">Answer:</span> People are Mevatel a bed to a live person (he needs it), but not a wallet to a child.</p>
<p class="bas indent1"><span class="nm">(i)</span><span class="cl">Question:</span> Why is he exempt for a dead child?</p>
<p class="bas indent1"><span class="nm">(j)</span><span class="cl">Answer:</span> Rava holds like R. Shimon, who exempts Melachah she'Einah Tzerichah l'Gufah. (The wallet is Batul to the Mes - at such a time, amidst grief, one does not plan to remove the wallet.)</p>
<p class="bas indent1"><span class="nm">(k)</span><span class="cl">(Mishnah):</span> One may carry a child holding a rock.</p>
<p class="bas indent1"><span class="nm">(l)</span><span class="cl">(D'vei R. Yanai):</span> The case is, the child is lovesick for his father (he will get sick if his father does not pick him up, but he is not in danger).</p>
<p class="bas indent1"><span class="nm">(m)</span><span class="cl">Question:</span> If so, it should be permitted even if the child is holding a coin - but this is not so!</p>
<p class="bas indent2"><span class="nm">1.</span><span class="cl">(Rava):</span> It is permitted only if he is holding a rock, not if he is holding a coin.</p>
<p class="bas indent1"><span class="nm">(n)</span><span class="cl">Answer:</span> If he drops a rock, the father will not pick it up; if he drops a coin, we are concerned lest the father pick it up.</p>
