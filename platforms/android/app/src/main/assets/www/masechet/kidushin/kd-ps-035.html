<p class="bas subject"><span class="nm">1)</span>AN ALTERNATIVE WAY TO LEARN</p>
<p class="bas indent1"><span class="nm">(a)</span><span class="cl">Question:</span> According to the opinion that learns from Shnei Kesuvim, what is the source (to exempt women from Mitzvos Aseh sheha'Zman Gerama)?</p>
<p class="bas indent1"><span class="nm">(b)</span><span class="cl">Answer (Rava):</span> "(You will wear Tefilin)... in order that Hash-m's Torah will be in your mouth" equates the entire Torah to Tefilin;</p>
<p class="bas indent2"><span class="nm">1.</span>Just like Tefilin is an Aseh sheha'Zman Gerama and women are exempt, they are exempt from every such Aseh.</p>
<p class="bas indent2"><span class="nm">2.</span><span class="cl">Inference:</span> They are exempt from an Aseh sheha'Zman Gerama, but they are obligated in Aseh she'Lo ha'Zman Gerama.</p>
<p class="bas indent1"><span class="nm">(c)</span><span class="cl">Question:</span> This answer is like the opinion that Tefilin is Zman Gerama. According to the opinion that Tefilin is not Zman Gerama, how can we answer?</p>
<p class="bas indent1"><span class="nm">(d)</span><span class="cl">Answer:</span> R. Meir holds that it is not Zman Gerama. He holds that we do not learn from Shnei Kesuvim (he learns like on 34b).</p>
<p class="bas indent1"><span class="nm">(e)</span><span class="cl">Question:</span> Rebbi Yehudah also holds that Tefilin is Lo ha'Zman Gerama, and he holds that we learn from Shnei Kesuvim. How can he learn?</p>
<p class="bas indent1"><span class="nm">(f)</span><span class="cl">Answer:</span> Matzah, Simchah and Hakhel are Sheloshah Kesuvim that obligate women. (All agree that we do not learn from Sheloshah Kesuvim.)</p>
<p class="bas subject"><span class="nm">2)</span>LAVIM</p>
<p class="bas indent1"><span class="nm">(a)</span><span class="cl">(Mishnah):</span> Every Lav (is obligatory for men and women...)</p>
<p class="bas indent1"><span class="nm">(b)</span><span class="cl">Question:</span> What is the source for this?</p>
<p class="bas indent1"><span class="nm">(c)</span><span class="cl">Answer (Rav Yehudah):</span> "A man or a woman who will transgresses any Aveirah" equates men and women for all punishments.</p>
<p class="bas indent1"><span class="nm">(d)</span><span class="cl">(Beraisa - Tana d'Vei R. Eliezer):</span> "That you will put in front of them" equates men and women for all (monetary) laws.</p>
<p class="bas indent1"><span class="nm">(e)</span><span class="cl">(D'Vei Chizkiyah - Beraisa):</span> "That will kill a man or woman" equates killing a man to killing a woman.</p>
<p class="bas indent1"><span class="nm">(f)</span>The Torah needed to teach about all of these;</p>
<p class="bas indent2"><span class="nm">1.</span>Had it taught only about punishments, one might have thought that this is so she will get atonement, but (monetary) judgments are for men (since normally, men do business);</p>
<p class="bas indent2"><span class="nm">2.</span>Had it taught only about judgments, one might have thought that this is so she can do business and earn a living, but Kofer (ransom for one killed by a Mu'ad animal) applies only to men, for they are commanded in all the Mitzvos.</p>
<p class="bas bbbline">35b----------------------------------------35b</p>
<p class="bas indent2"><span class="nm">3.</span>Had it taught only about Kofer, one might have thought that this is because a life was lost, but punishments and judgments do not apply to women.</p>
<p class="bas subject"><span class="nm">3)</span>SHAVING AND CUTTING THE PE'OS</p>
<p class="bas indent1"><span class="nm">(a)</span><span class="cl">(Mishnah):</span> ...Except for cutting the Pe'os (the hair at the corners of the head, i.e. the sideburns), shaving (the corners of the beard), and becoming Tamei (Mes).</p>
<p class="bas indent1"><span class="nm">(b)</span><span class="cl">Question:</span> We know the source that they are exempt from the Lav of Tum'ah - "the Kohanim Bnei Aharon", not the daughters of Aharon;</p>
<p class="bas indent2"><span class="nm">1.</span>What is the source that they are exempt from cutting the Pe'os and shaving?</p>
<p class="bas indent1"><span class="nm">(c)</span><span class="cl">Answer:</span> "Do not round the corner of your heads and do not destroy the corner of your beards" - whoever is commanded about the beard is commanded about the Pe'os;</p>
<p class="bas indent2"><span class="nm">1.</span>Since women are not forbidden to shave, they are not forbidden to cut Pe'os.</p>
<p class="bas indent1"><span class="nm">(d)</span><span class="cl">Question:</span> What is the source that they are exempt from shaving?</p>
<p class="bas indent1"><span class="nm">(e)</span><span class="cl">Answer #1:</span> Reasoning teaches this, for women have no beards!</p>
<p class="bas indent1"><span class="nm">(f)</span><span class="cl">Answer #2:</span> We learn from "Do not round the corner of your heads and do not destroy the corner of your beard";</p>
<p class="bas indent2"><span class="nm">1.</span>It uses the singular form for beard to teach that shaving does not apply to (all, i.e.) women.</p>
<p class="bas indent1"><span class="nm">(g)</span><span class="cl">Question (Beraisa):</span> The beard of a woman, or of a Seris (one who does not develop like a normal male) it is considered like a beard in all respects.</p>
<p class="bas indent2"><span class="nm">1.</span><span class="cl">Suggestion:</span> It is like a beard regarding the Isur to shave!</p>
<p class="bas indent2"><span class="nm">2.</span><span class="cl">Rejection (Abaye):</span> That cannot be. We learn a Gezeirah Shavah "Pe'as-Pe'as" from the Isur of Kohanim to shave. Just like that Isur does not apply to women (it says "Bnei Aharon"), also the Isur of Yisre'elim to shave does not apply to women.</p>
<p class="bas indent2"><span class="nm">3.</span><span class="cl">Question:</span> It says "Bnei Aharon" regarding Tum'ah. If the exclusion of Bnos Kohanim applied also to shaving, there would be no need for the Gezeirah Shavah!</p>
<p class="bas indent3"><span class="nm">i.</span>The Torah gave extra Mitzvos to Kohanim, yet the Isur to shave does not apply to Kohanos. All the more so, the Isur for Yisre'elim to shave does not apply to women!</p>
<p class="bas indent2"><span class="nm">4.</span><span class="cl">Answer:</span> We would have said that "Bnei Aharon" does not apply to shaving, for there is an interruption. (Rashi - in between, the Torah commands a Kohen to become Tamei for his deceased relatives. This is also for women, not only for Bnei Aharon.) We know that this is not so only because of the Gezeirah Shavah. (If Kohanos were forbidden to shave, the Gezeirah Shavah would not teach anything!)</p>
<p class="bas indent2"><span class="nm">5.</span><span class="cl">Question:</span> The Gezeirah Shavah could teach like the following Beraisa! ("Bnei Aharon" would not apply to shaving.)</p>
<p class="bas indent3"><span class="nm">i.</span><span class="cl">(Beraisa) Suggestion:</span> Perhaps one is liable for "they will not shave" even for shaving with scissors!</p>
<p class="bas indent3"><span class="nm">ii.</span><span class="cl">Rejection:</span> "Do not destroy (the corners of your beard)" teaches that this is not so. (Scissors do not cut the entire hair, this is not destruction.)</p>
<p class="bas indent3"><span class="nm">iii.</span><span class="cl">Suggestion:</span> Perhaps one is liable for destroying (removing) his beard with a planing tool or tweezers!</p>
<p class="bas indent3"><span class="nm">iv.</span><span class="cl">Rejection:</span> "Do not shave" teaches that this is not so (these are not ways of shaving).</p>
<p class="bas indent3"><span class="nm">v.</span>The Torah forbade shaving that destroys, i.e. with a razor.</p>
<p class="bas indent2"><span class="nm">6.</span><span class="cl">Answer:</span> We could have made the Gezeirah Shavah even had the Torah written 'do not round the Pe'as (corner) of your heads and do not destroy Es (it, i.e. the corner) in your beards' (this is like writing 'the Pe'as in your beard');</p>
<p class="bas indent3"><span class="nm">i.</span>The Torah explicitly wrote "Pe'as of your beard" to show that the Gezeirah Shavah teaches us more (i.e. that Benos Yisrael are exempt, just like Benos Aharon).</p>
<p class="bas indent1"><span class="nm">(h)</span>Our question remains!</p>
<p class="bas indent2"><span class="nm">1.</span><span class="cl">(Beraisa):</span> The beard of a woman, or of a Seris (one who does not develop like a normal male) it is considered like a beard in all respects.</p>
<p class="bas indent1"><span class="nm">(i)</span><span class="cl">Answer #1 (Mar Zutra):</span> It is considered a beard if Tzara'as appears in it.</p>
<p class="bas indent1"><span class="nm">(j)</span><span class="cl">Objection:</span> It explicitly says "a man or woman who will have a plague in the head or beard..."! (Why must a Beraisa teach this?)</p>
<p class="bas indent1"><span class="nm">(k)</span><span class="cl">Answer #2 (Mar Zutra):</span> Rather, 'it is considered a beard' teaches that a Metzora must shave it to become Tahor.</p>
<p class="bas indent1"><span class="nm">(l)</span><span class="cl">Objection:</span> This is obvious. Since Tum'as Tzara'as applies to it, it is also like a beard to become Tahor!</p>
<p class="bas indent1"><span class="nm">(m)</span><span class="cl">Defense of Answer #1:</span> Really, it is considered a beard if Tzara'as appears in it;</p>
<p class="bas indent2"><span class="nm">1.</span>One might have thought that the verse means that a man or woman can have a plague of the head, but only men can have plagues of the beard. The Beraisa teaches that this is not so.</p>
<p class="bas subject"><span class="nm">4)</span>MAY A WOMAN TEAR HER HAIR?</p>
<p class="bas indent1"><span class="nm">(a)</span><span class="cl">(Isi - Beraisa):</span> Women are also exempt from tearing out their hair (in grief over a Mes).</p>
<p class="bas indent2"><span class="nm">1.</span>Isi expounds "You are sons to Hash-m... do not scratch yourselves or make a bald spot due to a Mes, for you are a holy nation" - sons are commanded, but daughters are not.</p>
<p class="bas indent1"><span class="nm">(b)</span><span class="cl">Suggestion:</span> Perhaps women are excluded from scratching, but they are commanded about a bald spot!</p>
<p class="bas indent1"><span class="nm">(c)</span><span class="cl">Rejection:</span> "You are a holy nation to Hash-m" includes women (they may not scratch themselves).</p>
<p class="bas indent1"><span class="nm">(d)</span><span class="cl">Question:</span> Perhaps "nation" forbids women to make a bald spot, and "sons" permits them to scratch themselves!</p>
<p class="bas indent1"><span class="nm">(e)</span><span class="cl">Answer #1:</span> It is more reasonable to say that women are commanded about scratching, for this applies in all places, whether or not hair grows there;</p>
<p class="bas indent2"><span class="nm">1.</span>Making a bald spot applies only where hair grows.</p>
<p class="bas indent1"><span class="nm">(f)</span><span class="cl">Question:</span> Perhaps "sons" excludes daughters, regarding both scratching and tearing out hair!</p>
<p class="bas indent2"><span class="nm">1.</span>"You are a holy nation to Hash-m" - would include women for the Isur to scratch themselves with a tool.</p>
<p class="bas indent1"><span class="nm">(g)</span><span class="cl">Answer:</span> Isi holds that there is no distinction between scratching by hand or with a tool.</p>
