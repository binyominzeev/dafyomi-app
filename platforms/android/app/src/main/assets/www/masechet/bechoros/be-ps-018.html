<p class="bas subject"><span class="nm">1)</span>EFSHAR LETZAMTZEM (cont.)</p>
<p class="bas indent1"><span class="nm">(a)</span><span class="cl">Answer #4 (Beraisa - R. Eliezer):</span> If a murdered corpse was found equidistant from two cities, each of them brings an Eglah Arufah.</p>
<p class="bas indent2"><span class="nm">1.</span><span class="cl">Suggestion:</span> He holds that Efshar Letzamtzem. The verse says that "ha'Kerovah" (the closest city) brings. This can also mean the closest <i>cities</i> (if they are equidistant. We are thinking that he holds Iy Efshar Letzamtzem b'Yedei Shamayim, like Chachamim.)</p>
<p class="bas indent1"><span class="nm">(b)</span><span class="cl">Rejection:</span> R. Eliezer holds like R. Yosi ha'Gelili, who says that Efshar Letzamtzem b'Yedei Shamayim, and all the more so b'Yedei Adam. We cannot learn from him about Chachamim.</p>
<p class="bas indent1"><span class="nm">(c)</span><span class="cl">Suggestion:</span> Tana'im argue about whether Efshar Letzamtzem b'Yedei Adam:</p>
<p class="bas indent2"><span class="nm">1.</span><span class="cl">(Beraisa):</span> If it was found equidistant from two cities, no Eglah is brought;</p>
<p class="bas indent2"><span class="nm">2.</span>R. Eliezer says, each of them brings an Eglah.</p>
<p class="bas indent2"><span class="nm">3.</span><span class="cl">Suggestion:</span> The first Tana holds that Iy Efshar Letzamtzem, and R. Eliezer holds that Efshar Letzamtzem.</p>
<p class="bas indent2"><span class="nm">4.</span><span class="cl">Rejection:</span> This is unreasonable. If the first Tana held that Iy Efshar Letzamtzem, we would bring an Eglah on condition (that it is for the closer city)!</p>
<p class="bas indent3"><span class="nm">i.</span>Rather, both agree that Efshar Letzamtzem;</p>
<p class="bas indent3"><span class="nm">ii.</span>The first Tana expounds "ha'Kerovah", but not ha'Kerovos (if two are equidistant, neither brings). R. Eliezer expounds "ha'Kerovah", and even ha'Kerovos.</p>
<p class="bas indent1"><span class="nm">(d)</span><span class="cl">Question:</span> What was the conclusion?</p>
<p class="bas indent1"><span class="nm">(e)</span><span class="cl">Answer (R. Chiya bar Avin - Beraisa - R. Eliezer):</span> If it was found equidistant from two cities, each of them brings an Eglah;</p>
<p class="bas indent2"><span class="nm">1.</span>Chachamim say, they bring one Eglah and stipulate (that it is for the closer city).</p>
<p class="bas indent2"><span class="nm">2.</span><span class="cl">Question:</span> How do we understand Chachamim?</p>
<p class="bas indent3"><span class="nm">i.</span>If they hold that Efshar Letzamtzem, and expound "ha'Kerovah", and even ha'Kerovos, then two Eglos should be brought!</p>
<p class="bas indent3"><span class="nm">ii.</span>If they hold that Efshar Letzamtzem, and expound "ha'Kerovah", but not ha'Kerovos, no Eglah should be brought!</p>
<p class="bas indent2"><span class="nm">3.</span><span class="cl">Answer:</span> They hold that Iy Efshar Letzamtzem, even b'Yedei Adam.</p>
<p class="bas subject"><span class="nm">2)</span>WHAT DOES THE <i>KOHEN</i> RECEIVE?</p>
<p class="bas indent1"><span class="nm">(a)</span><span class="cl">(Mishnah - R. Tarfon):</span> The Kohen takes the nicer animal.</p>
<p class="bas indent1"><span class="nm">(b)</span><span class="cl">Question:</span> What is his reason?</p>
<p class="bas indent1"><span class="nm">(c)</span><span class="cl">Answer:</span> Presumably, the healthier animal left the womb first.</p>
<p class="bas indent1"><span class="nm">(d)</span><span class="cl">(Mishnah - R. Akiva):</span> Meshamnim Beineihem.</p>
<p class="bas indent1"><span class="nm">(e)</span><span class="cl">(R. Chiya bar Aba citing R. Yochanan):</span> The Kohen takes the weaker animal.</p>
<p class="bas indent2"><span class="nm">1.</span><span class="cl">Question (R. Chiya bar Aba):</span> "Meshamnim Beineihem" connotes that they divide the animals equally!</p>
<p class="bas indent2"><span class="nm">2.</span><span class="cl">R. Yochanan:</span> You were indulging yourself with dates (Rashi; R. Gershom - eating poor dates) in Bavel when I derived my teaching from the Seifa!</p>
<p class="bas indent3"><span class="nm">i.</span><span class="cl">(Seifa - R. Tarfon):</span> If one of the animals dies, they divide the other animal;</p>
<p class="bas indent3"><span class="nm">ii.</span>R. Akiva says, ha'Motzei me'Chavero Alav ha'Re'ayah.</p>
<p class="bas indent2"><span class="nm">3.</span>If Meshamnim indeed means that they divide the animals equally, R. Akiva would say so also in the Seifa!</p>
<p class="bas indent3"><span class="nm">i.</span>Rather, "Meshamnim Beineihem" connotes that the difference in value of the two animals is (contested) between them. The Yisrael keeps it until the Kohen proves that the nicer animal is the Bechor.</p>
<p class="bas indent1"><span class="nm">(f)</span><span class="cl">(Mishnah):</span> Reuven's animal grazes until it gets a Mum. Matanos must be given; R. Yosi exempts.</p>
<p class="bas indent1"><span class="nm">(g)</span><span class="cl">Question:</span> What is R. Meir's reason? (A Stam (unattributed) Mishnah is assumed to be R. Meir. Also, R. Meir explicitly obligates in the Seifa (18b).)</p>
<p class="bas indent1"><span class="nm">(h)</span><span class="cl">Answer (R. Yochanan):</span> No matter which animal was the Bechor, the Matanos belong to Kohanim:</p>
<p class="bas indent2"><span class="nm">1.</span>If Reuven kept the Bechor, the entire animal should have been given to a Kohen;</p>
<p class="bas indent2"><span class="nm">2.</span>If Reuven kept the Pashut, Matanos must be given to a Kohen!</p>
<p class="bas indent1"><span class="nm">(i)</span><span class="cl">Question:</span> What is R. Yosi's reason?</p>
<p class="bas indent1"><span class="nm">(j)</span><span class="cl">Answer (Rava):</span> (If Reuven kept the Bechor,) Chachamim consider it as if the Kohen acquired the Bechor;</p>
<p class="bas indent2"><span class="nm">1.</span>Even though the Kohen never received it, we consider it as if he received it and, after it got a Mum, traded it with Reuven for the Pashut. (A Bechor Ba'al Mum is exempt from Matanos.)</p>
<p class="bas subject"><span class="nm">3)</span>ARE <i>MATANOS</i> GIVEN?</p>
<p class="bas indent1"><span class="nm">(a)</span><span class="cl">(R. Elazar):</span> All agree that Matanos must be given from a Safek Bechor in a case when the Kohen does not receive anything. (E.g. a Mevakeres gave birth to a male and female, and we do not know which was first.)</p>
<p class="bas indent1"><span class="nm">(b)</span><span class="cl">Objection:</span> Surely, he teaches that R. Yosi agrees. This is obvious!</p>
<p class="bas indent2"><span class="nm">1.</span>R. Yosi exempts only when the Kohen received an animal, for it is as if he traded the Bechor for Reuven's animal. When the Kohen did not receive anything, surely he agrees with R. Meir!</p>
<p class="bas indent1"><span class="nm">(c)</span><span class="cl">Answer:</span> One might have thought that R. Yosi decrees to exempt in every case, lest people think that it is like a regular Chulin animal, and they will shear it or work with it. R. Elazar teaches that this is not so.</p>
<p class="bas indent1"><span class="nm">(d)</span><span class="cl">Question:</span> We never would have thought so, due to the Seifa!</p>
<p class="bas indent2"><span class="nm">1.</span><span class="cl">(Seifa - R. Yosi):</span> Whenever the Kohen received Chalipin of (something in exchange for) an animal, the animal is exempt from Matanos.</p>
<p class="bas bbbline">18b----------------------------------------18b</p>
<p class="bas indent2"><span class="nm">2.</span>R. Meir obligates Matanos.</p>
<p class="bas indent2"><span class="nm">3.</span><span class="cl">Inference:</span> R. Yosi exempts only when the Kohen received Chalipin!</p>
<p class="bas indent1"><span class="nm">(e)</span><span class="cl">Answer:</span> One might have thought that R. Yosi addresses R. Meir according to R. Meir's reasoning;</p>
<p class="bas indent2"><span class="nm">1.</span>I exempt even when the Kohen did not receive Chalipin, lest people come to shear it or work with it;</p>
<p class="bas indent2"><span class="nm">2.</span>Granted, you argue with this. However, you should agree that when the Kohen received Chalipin, in any case it is exempt!</p>
<p class="bas indent2"><span class="nm">3.</span>R. Meir disagreed.</p>
<p class="bas indent1"><span class="nm">(f)</span><span class="cl">(Rav Papa):</span> All agree that Safek Ma'aser (Rashi - an Asiri became mixed with Chulin animals) is exempt from Matanos.</p>
<p class="bas indent1"><span class="nm">(g)</span><span class="cl">Objection:</span> Surely, he teaches that R. Meir agrees. This is obvious!</p>
<p class="bas indent2"><span class="nm">1.</span>R. Meir obligates only a Safek Bechor, for in any case, the Matanos belong to Kohanim. He would not obligate Safek Ma'aser!</p>
<p class="bas indent1"><span class="nm">(h)</span><span class="cl">Answer:</span> One might have thought that R. Meir obligates, lest people will forget the law of Matanos, and this also applies to Safek Ma'aser. Rav Papa teaches that this is not so.</p>
<p class="bas indent1"><span class="nm">(i)</span><span class="cl">Question:</span> We never would have thought so, due to the Seifa!</p>
<p class="bas indent2"><span class="nm">1.</span><span class="cl">(Seifa - R. Yosi):</span> Whenever the Kohen received Chalipin, the other animal (the Yisrael's) is exempt from Matanos.</p>
<p class="bas indent2"><span class="nm">2.</span>R. Meir obligates. (If R. Meir obligates lest people forget the law of Matanos, then R. Yosi should not discuss when the Kohen received Chalipin. R. Meir could agree to this!)</p>
<p class="bas indent1"><span class="nm">(j)</span><span class="cl">Answer:</span> One might have thought that R. Meir obligates even Safek Ma'aser, and the Beraisa discusses Bechor to teach the extremity of R. Yosi's opinion. I.e. even though in any case Matanos should be given, he exempts;</p>
<p class="bas indent2"><span class="nm">1.</span>Rav Papa teaches that this is not so.</p>
<p class="bas subject"><span class="nm">4)</span>IF ONE OF THEM DIED</p>
<p class="bas indent1"><span class="nm">(a)</span><span class="cl">(Mishnah - R. Tarfon):</span> If one of the twins dies, they share the other animal.</p>
<p class="bas indent1"><span class="nm">(b)</span><span class="cl">Question:</span> (In the Reisha,) R. Tarfon assumes that the healthier animal came out first. The Kohen should get the healthier animal, whether it is dead or alive!</p>
<p class="bas indent1"><span class="nm">(c)</span><span class="cl">Answer (R. Ami):</span> R. Tarfon retracted from what he said in the Reisha.</p>
<p class="bas indent1"><span class="nm">(d)</span><span class="cl">(Mishnah - R. Akiva):</span> Ha'Motzi me'Chavero Alav ha'Re'ayah.</p>
<p class="bas indent1"><span class="nm">(e)</span><span class="cl">(R. Chiya):</span> The following is a parable for R. Tarfon's law. Reuven and Shimon each deposited an animal with a shepherd. (One animal died, it is not known which one.) The shepherd leaves the live animal in front of them (and they divide it).</p>
<p class="bas indent1"><span class="nm">(f)</span>The following is a parable for R. Akiva's law. Reuven deposited an animal by Shimon, who put it with his flock. (One animal died, and it is not known whose.) Ha'Motzi me'Chavero Alav ha'Re'ayah (Reuven must prove that his animal did not die).</p>
<p class="bas indent1"><span class="nm">(g)</span><span class="cl">Question:</span> In which case do they argue?</p>
<p class="bas indent2"><span class="nm">1.</span>Would R. Akiva argue when the Safek Bechor was deposited with a shepherd?! Surely, he agrees that they divide it!</p>
<p class="bas indent2"><span class="nm">2.</span>Would R. Tarfon argue when the Safek Bechor is with the Yisrael?! Surely, he agrees that ha'Motzi me'Chavero Alav ha'Re'ayah!</p>
<p class="bas indent1"><span class="nm">(h)</span><span class="cl">Answer (Rava):</span> All agree that if Reuven and Shimon deposited with one shepherd, the shepherd leaves the live animal in front of them and they divide it;</p>
<p class="bas indent2"><span class="nm">1.</span>All agree that if Reuven deposited with Shimon, Reuven cannot take without proof;</p>
<p class="bas indent2"><span class="nm">2.</span>They argue about a Kohen who takes care of the Yisrael's animals on the Yisrael's premises;</p>
<p class="bas indent3"><span class="nm">i.</span>R. Tarfon holds that the Yisrael is Makneh (transfers ownership) of his land to the Kohen, in order that the Kohen will acquire Bechoros when they are born, for he wants the Mitzvah (R. Gershom - of giving the Bechor to a Kohen; Rashi - of raising the Kohen's Bechor on his property);</p>
<p class="bas indent3"><span class="nm">ii.</span>It is considered as if they are partners in the land. They are equally Muchzak, therefore they divide;</p>
<p class="bas indent2"><span class="nm">3.</span>R. Akiva holds that the Yisrael is not Makneh, for he does not want to lose (Safek Bechoros). It is as if the Kohen deposited with him (the Yisrael is Muchzak). The Kohen cannot take without proof.</p>
<p class="bas subject"><span class="nm">5)</span><i>SAFEK BECHORO</i> BORN TO TWO ANIMALS</p>
<p class="bas indent1"><span class="nm">(a)</span>(In the Mishnah, Reuven left pregnant sheep. Offspring were born, and no one saw the births. The Kohen may offer the male(s) that he receives only if they are definite Bechoros. Otherwise (or after the Churban) he eats them after they get a Mum.)</p>
<p class="bas indent1"><span class="nm">(b)</span><span class="cl">(Mishnah):</span> If two males were born to two Mevakros, the Kohen receives both of them;</p>
<p class="bas indent1"><span class="nm">(c)</span>If they gave birth to a male and a female, the Kohen receives the male.</p>
<p class="bas indent1"><span class="nm">(d)</span>R. Tarfon says, if they gave birth to two males and a female, the Kohen receives the nicer male;</p>
<p class="bas indent1"><span class="nm">(e)</span>R. Akiva says, Meshamnim Beineihem (he gets the inferior one). Reuven's male grazes until it gets a Mum. Reuven eats it, and he must give Matanos;</p>
<p class="bas indent1"><span class="nm">(f)</span>R. Yosi exempts (from Matanos).</p>
<p class="bas indent1"><span class="nm">(g)</span>R. Tarfon says, if one of the males dies, they share the other male;</p>
<p class="bas indent1"><span class="nm">(h)</span>R. Akiva says, ha'Motzi me'Chavero Alav ha'Re'ayah.</p>
<p class="bas indent1"><span class="nm">(i)</span>If they gave birth to two females and one or two males, the Kohen does not receive anything. (Perhaps each mother gave birth to a female first);</p>
<p class="bas indent1"><span class="nm">(j)</span>If only one of the mothers was a Mevakeres and they gave birth to two males, the Kohen receives one of them;</p>
<p class="bas indent2"><span class="nm">1.</span>R. Tarfon says, the Kohen receives the nicer one;</p>
<p class="bas indent2"><span class="nm">2.</span>R. Akiva says, Meshamnim Beineihem.</p>
<p class="bas indent1"><span class="nm">(k)</span>Reuven's animal grazes until it gets a Mum, and then he eats it.</p>
<p class="bas indent1"><span class="nm">(l)</span>Matanos must be given;</p>
<p class="bas indent1"><span class="nm">(m)</span>R. Yosi exempts;</p>
<p class="bas indent2"><span class="nm">1.</span>R. Yosi says, whenever the Kohen received Chalipin of an animal, the animal is exempt from Matanos.</p>
<p class="bas indent2"><span class="nm">2.</span>R. Meir obligates.</p>
<p class="bas indent1"><span class="nm">(n)</span>R. Tarfon says, if one of the males dies, they share the other male;</p>

<p class="bas indent1"><span class="nm">(p)</span>If they gave birth to a female and a male, the Kohen does not receive anything. (Perhaps the Mevakeres gave birth to the female).</p>
<p class="bas indent1"><span class="nm">(q)</span><span class="cl">(Gemara):</span> The argument of R. Akiva and R. Tarfon needed to be taught in all three cases:</p>
<p class="bas indent2"><span class="nm">1.</span>Had they argued only above (17a), when two males are born to one animal, we would have thought that R. Akiva agrees (in the Reisha of our Mishnah,) when two males and a female are born to two animals, for surely the healthier animal was a lone child! (Presumably, this is only if the better male is better than the female. If not, we should say that the female was the lone child!)</p>
<p class="bas indent2"><span class="nm">2.</span>Had they argued only in the Reisha, we would have thought that R. Akiva agrees in the Seifa, when males are born to a Mevakeres and a mother that already gave birth, for surely the healthier animal was born to the Mevakeres.</p>
