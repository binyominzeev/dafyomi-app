<div class="subject"><span class="nm">1)</span><p>GIRLS WHO DO NOT RECEIVE A FINE (cont.)</p></div>
<div class="indent1"><span class="nm">(a)</span><p><span class="cl">Question:</span> What are Arayos and Shniyos l'Arayos?</p></div>
<div class="indent1"><span class="nm">(b)</span><p><span class="cl">Answer #1:</span> If Arayos is literal (relatives forbidden mid'Oraisa) and Shniyos l'Arayos are relatives forbidden mid'Rabanan.</p></div>
<div class="indent1"><span class="nm">(c)</span><p><span class="cl">Rejection:</span> Since Shniyos are permitted mid'Oraisa, there is a fine for them!</p></div>
<div class="indent1"><span class="nm">(d)</span><p><span class="cl">Version #1 - Answer #2:</span> Arayos are Chayavei Misos Beis Din and Shniyos l'Arayos are Chayavei Krisos;</p></div>
<div class="indent2"><span class="nm">1.</span><p>However, there is a fine of Chayavei Lavin (because Kidushin is Tofsin). This is like Shimon ha'Teimani.</p></div>
<div class="indent1"><span class="nm">(e)</span><p><span class="cl">Version #2 - Answer #2:</span> Arayos are Chayavei Misos Beis Din and Chayavei Krisos. Shniyos l'Arayos are Chayavei Lavin. This is like R. Shimon ben Menasya (who says that there is a fine only if one may marry her).</p></div>
<div class="indent1"><span class="nm">(f)</span><p><span class="cl">(Beraisa #1):</span> A Mema'enes does not receive a fine.</p></div>
<div class="indent1"><span class="nm">(g)</span><p><span class="cl">Inference:</span> Other minors receive a fine.</p></div>
<div class="indent2"><span class="nm">1.</span><p>This is like Chachamim, who say that there is a fine for a minor.</p></div>
<div class="indent1"><span class="nm">(h)</span><p><span class="cl">Question (Seifa):</span> There is no fine for an Ailonis.</p></div>
<div class="indent2"><span class="nm">1.</span><p>This is like R. Meir, who says that only a Na'arah receives a fine. Since an Ailonis goes from being a minor to a Bogeres (she is never a Na'arah), she gets no fine.</p></div>
<div class="indent2"><span class="nm">2.</span><p>Is the Reisha like Chachamim and the Seifa like R. Meir?!</p></div>
<div class="indent1"><span class="nm">(i)</span><p><span class="cl">Answer #1:</span> The entire Mishnah is R. Meir. He holds like R. Yehudah regarding Mi'un (that a Na'arah can do Mi'un).</p></div>
<div class="indent1"><span class="nm">(j)</span><p><span class="cl">Rejection (Beraisa #2 - R. Meir):</span> A girl can do Mi'un until she brings two hairs (after 12 years and becomes a Na'arah);</p></div>
<div class="indent2"><span class="nm">1.</span><p>R. Yehudah permits until there is more black (due to hairs) than white.</p></div>
<div class="indent1"><span class="nm">(k)</span><p><span class="cl">Answer #2:</span> The entire Mishnah is R. Yehudah. He holds like R. Meir regarding a minor (that she receives a fine).</p></div>
<div class="indent1"><span class="nm">(l)</span><p><span class="cl">Rejection:</span> This is not so!</p></div>
<div class="indent2"><span class="nm">1.</span><p><span class="cl">(Rav Yehudah):</span> The Mishnah is like R. Meir.</p></div>
<div class="indent2"><span class="nm">2.</span><p>If Answer #2 were correct, Yehudah would have said that the Mishnah is like R. Meir and R. Yehudah!</p></div>
<div class="indent1"><span class="nm">(m)</span><p><span class="cl">Answer #3:</span> The Tana of Beraisa #1 holds like R. Meir regarding a minor, and like R. Yehudah regarding Mi'un.</p></div>
<div class="indent1"><span class="nm">(n)</span><p><span class="cl">Answer #4 (Rafram):</span> In Beraisa #1, 'Mema'enes' means one who could do Mi'un, i.e. a minor.</p></div>
<div class="indent1"><span class="nm">(o)</span><p><span class="cl">Question:</span> If so, the Beraisa should simply say 'a minor'!</p></div>
<div class="indent2"><span class="nm">1.</span><p>This is left difficult.</p></div>
<div class="indent1"><span class="nm">(p)</span><p><span class="cl">(Beraisa #1):</span> An Ailonis does not receive a fine.</p></div>
<div class="indent1"><span class="nm">(q)</span><p><span class="cl">Contradiction (Beraisa #3):</span> A deaf or insane girl or an Ailonis receives a fine.</p></div>
<div class="indent1"><span class="nm">(r)</span><p><span class="cl">Objection:</span> The answer is obvious! R. Meir says that an Ailonis receives no fine (since she is never a Na'arah). Chachamim say she receives a fine when she is a minor!</p></div>
<div class="indent2"><span class="nm">1.</span><p><span class="cl">Question:</span> The one who asked this should have anticipated the answer!</p></div>
<div class="indent2"><span class="nm">2.</span><p><span class="cl">Answer:</span> He brought this Beraisa in order to ask the following contradiction.</p></div>
<div class="subject"><span class="nm">2)</span><p>GIRLS AGAINST WHOM THERE IS NO TA'ANAS BESULIM</p></div>
<div class="indent1"><span class="nm">(a)</span><p><span class="cl">Contradiction (against Beraisa #3 - Beraisa #4):</span> There is no Ta'anas Besulim against the following: a deaf or insane girl, a Bogeres, or a Mukas Etz.</p></div>
<div class="indent2"><span class="nm">1.</span><p>There is Ta'anas Besulim against a blind girl or an Ailonis;</p></div>
<div class="indent2"><span class="nm">2.</span><p>R. Meir says, there is no claim against a blind girl.</p></div>
<div class="indent2"><span class="nm">3.</span><p>(Since a deaf (or insane) girl is not assumed to be a virgin, there should be no fine!)</p></div>
<div class="indent1"><span class="nm">(b)</span><p>Answer (Rav Sheshes):	R. Gamliel and R. Yehoshua argue about this. (All agree that she receives a fine because she is assumed to be a virgin! R. Gamliel (12b) says that there is no Ta'anas Besulim against her, for if a healthy girl would claim that she was raped she would be believed, therefore we make this claim on behalf of a deaf girl. R. Yehoshua does not believe one who says that she was raped, therefore there is Ta'anas Besulim against a deaf girl.)</p></div>
<div class="indent1"><span class="nm">(c)</span><p><span class="cl">Question:</span> We know only that R. Gamliel believes her when she makes a claim. Would he believe her even when she makes no claim?</p></div>
<div class="indent1"><span class="nm">(d)</span><p><span class="cl">Answer:</span> Yes! In any case like this (she does not know to make the claim), we claim this for her.</p></div>
<div class="indent1"><span class="nm">(e)</span><p><span class="cl">(Beraisa #4):</span> There is no Ta'anas Besulim against a Bogeres.</p></div>
<div class="indent1"><span class="nm">(f)</span><p><span class="cl">Question:</span> Rav said that a Bogeres may have Bi'ah the entire first night (any blood is attributed to Dam Besulim)!</p></div>
<div class="bbbline">36b----------------------------------------36b</p></div>
<div class="indent1"><span class="nm">(g)</span><p><span class="cl">Answer:</span> If no blood is found, he has Ta'anas Besulim. The Beraisa teaches that if he claims Pesach Pasu'ach, this is not a claim.</p></div>
<div class="indent1"><span class="nm">(h)</span><p><span class="cl">(Beraisa - R. Meir):</span> There is no Ta'anas Besulim against a blind girl.</p></div>
<div class="indent1"><span class="nm">(i)</span><p><span class="cl">(R. Zeira):</span> This is because she falls on the ground (and loses her Besulim).</p></div>
<div class="indent1"><span class="nm">(j)</span><p><span class="cl">Question:</span> All girls fall!</p></div>
<div class="indent1"><span class="nm">(k)</span><p><span class="cl">Answer:</span> If a healthy girl sees blood after falling she tells her mother (who will realize that she is a Mukas Etz). A blind girl will not.</p></div>
<div class="indent1"><span class="nm">(l)</span><p><span class="cl">(Beraisa (Sof 35b)):</span> One who was divorced due to Motzi Shem Ra does not receive a fine.</p></div>
<div class="indent1"><span class="nm">(m)</span><p><span class="cl">Question:</span> She is stoned for adultery!</p></div>
<div class="indent1"><span class="nm">(n)</span><p><span class="cl">Answer (Rav Sheshes):</span> It means that a girl of ill repute in her youth does not receive a fine.</p></div>
<div class="indent1"><span class="nm">(o)</span><p><span class="cl">(Rav Papa):</span> This shows that we do not collect with a bad document.</p></div>
<div class="indent1"><span class="nm">(p)</span><p><span class="cl">Question:</span> What is the case?</p></div>
<div class="indent2"><span class="nm">1.</span><p><span class="cl">Suggestion:</span> There is a rumor that it was forged. Correspondingly, there was a rumor that she had Znus.</p></div>
<div class="indent2"><span class="nm">2.</span><p><span class="cl">Rejection:</span> Rava taught that we are not concerned for such rumors!</p></div>
<div class="indent1"><span class="nm">(q)</span><p><span class="cl">Answer:</span> Two men came and said that she asked them to have Bi'ah with her. Correspondingly, two men said that the bearer of the document asked them to forge for him.</p></div>
<div class="indent1"><span class="nm">(r)</span><p><span class="cl">Question:</span> The comparison is faulty! Many men would agree to Bi'ah, but we do not suspect Yisraelim of forgery!</p></div>
<div class="indent1"><span class="nm">(s)</span><p><span class="cl">Answer:</span> Since he was trying to get a forged document, we are concerned that he forged it himself.</p></div>
<div class="subject"><span class="nm">3)</span><p>A REDEEMED CAPTIVE</p></div>
<div class="indent1"><span class="nm">(a)</span><p><span class="cl">(Mishnah):</span> These girls do not receive a fine:</p></div>
<div class="indent2"><span class="nm">1.</span><p>A convert, captive or slave who converted, was redeemed or was freed above the age of three years;</p></div>
<div class="indent2"><span class="nm">2.</span><p>R. Yehudah says, a redeemed captive retains her Kedushah (is assumed to be a virgin), even if she was above three;</p></div>
<div class="indent1"><span class="nm">(b)</span><p>One who has Bi'ah with his or his wife's daughter or granddaughter does not pay a fine, since he is Chayav Misah in Beis Din;</p></div>
<div class="indent2"><span class="nm">1.</span><p>Anyone liable to die does not pay - "If there is no fatality, he will be punished monetarily".</p></div>
<div class="indent1"><span class="nm">(c)</span><p><span class="cl">(Gemara - R. Yochanan):</span> R. Yehudah (in our Mishnah) and R. Dosa said the same law.</p></div>
<div class="indent2"><span class="nm">1.</span><p><span class="cl">(Beraisa - R. Dosa):</span> A woman who was taken captive may eat Terumah;</p></div>
<div class="indent2"><span class="nm">2.</span><p>We do not disqualify her from Kehunah just because her captor pushed her around!</p></div>
<div class="indent1"><span class="nm">(d)</span><p><span class="cl">Objection (Rabah):</span> Perhaps they disagree with each other!</p></div>
<div class="indent2"><span class="nm">1.</span><p>R. Yehudah said here that she retains her Kedushah, so one who rapes or seduces her will not profit. He could hold like the Chachamim of R. Dosa, who disqualify her from Kehunah!</p></div>
<div class="indent2"><span class="nm">2.</span><p>R. Dosa permitted her to eat Terumah mid'Rabanan. Regarding the fine mid'Oraisa, he could hold that she does not collect it!</p></div>
<div class="indent1"><span class="nm">(e)</span><p><span class="cl">Question (Abaye):</span> R. Yehudah's reason is not to prevent a sinner from profiting!</p></div>
<div class="indent2"><span class="nm">1.</span><p><span class="cl">(Beraisa - R. Yehudah):</span> A captured girl retains her Kedushah. Even if she was 10 years old, her Kesuvah is 200.</p></div>
<div class="indent2"><span class="nm">2.</span><p>We cannot say that the reason is to prevent a sinner from profiting!</p></div>
<div class="indent1"><span class="nm">(f)</span><p><span class="cl">Answer:</span> There, we are concerned lest men (assume that she was defiled and) refrain from marrying her.</p></div>
<div class="indent1"><span class="nm">(g)</span><p><span class="cl">Question:</span> R. Yehudah holds that she does not retain her Kedushah!</p></div>
<div class="indent2"><span class="nm">1.</span><p><span class="cl">(Beraisa):</span> If a Kohen redeemed a captive, he may marry her. If he testified that she is Tehorah, he may not marry her;</p></div>
<div class="indent2"><span class="nm">2.</span><p>R. Yehudah says, in either case he may not marry her.</p></div>
<div class="indent2"><span class="nm">3.</span><p><span class="cl">Objection:</span> This is illogical! If he can marry her when he redeems her, surely it is no worse when he also testifies to her Kedushah!</p></div>
<div class="indent2"><span class="nm">4.</span><p><span class="cl">Answer:</span> When he redeems <i>and</i> testifies about her, he may marry her. If he only testifies about her, he may not.</p></div>
<div class="indent2"><span class="nm">5.</span><p>In any case, R. Yehudah contradicts his opinion in our Mishnah!</p></div>
<div class="indent1"><span class="nm">(h)</span><p><span class="cl">Answer #1 (Rav Papa):</span> Correct the Beraisa to say that R. Yehudah says, in either case he may marry her.</p></div>
<div class="indent1"><span class="nm">(i)</span><p><span class="cl">Answer #2 (Rav Huna brei d'Rav Yehoshua):</span> Do not change the text. R. Yehudah addresses Chachamim according to their opinion:</p></div>
<div class="indent2"><span class="nm">1.</span><p><span class="cl">R. Yehudah:</span> I hold that in either case he may marry her. You should say that in either case he may not marry her!</p></div>
<div class="indent2"><span class="nm">2.</span><p>Chachamim hold that a man would not waste his money. He would not redeem her if he was not sure that she is Tehorah;</p></div>
<div class="indent2"><span class="nm">3.</span><p>If he only testifies about her, we suspect that he merely desires her.</p></div>
