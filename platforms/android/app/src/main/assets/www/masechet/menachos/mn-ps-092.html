<div class="indent1"><span class="nm">(a)</span><p><span class="cl">(Mishnah):</span> Semichah does not apply to Korbanos Tzibur, except for Par He'elam Davar (brought for mistaken Hora'ah) and Se'ir ha'Mishtale'ach (the goat sent to Azazel on Yom Kipur);</p></div>
<div class="indent1"><span class="nm">(b)</span><p>R. Shimon says, it also applies to Se'irei Avodah Zarah (brought for mistaken Hora'ah about idolatry).</p></div>
<div class="indent1"><span class="nm">(c)</span><p>Semichah applies to all Korbanos Yachid, except for Bechor, Ma'aser and Pesach.</p></div>
<div class="indent1"><span class="nm">(d)</span><p>If one inherited a Korban, he brings it, does Semichah, brings the Nesachim and he can make Temurah.</p></div>
<div class="indent1"><span class="nm">(e)</span><p><span class="cl">(Gemara - Beraisa - R. Shimon):</span> Semichah does not apply to Korbanos Tzibur, except for Par He'elam Davar and Se'irei Avodah Zarah;</p></div>
<div class="indent1"><span class="nm">(f)</span><p>R. Yehudah says, Semichah does not apply to Se'irei Avodah Zarah. In place of them, it applies to Se'ir ha'Mishtale'ach.</p></div>

<div class="indent2"><span class="nm">2.</span><p><span class="cl">Answer (Ravina):</span> There is a tradition that Semichah applies to two Korbanos Tzibur.</p></div>
<div class="indent1"><span class="nm">(g)</span><p><span class="cl">R. Shimon:</span> The Ba'alim (those who get atonement through a Korban) must do Semichah, but the Kohen Gadol is Somech on Se'ir ha'Mishtale'ach (even though it does not atone for him. Therefore, this is not counted among the two Semichos.)</p></div>
<div class="indent1"><span class="nm">(h)</span><p><span class="cl">R. Yehudah:</span> Indeed, the Se'ir atones for the Kohen Gadol!</p></div>
<div class="indent1"><span class="nm">(i)</span><p><span class="cl">(R. Yirmeyah):</span> This is like R. Shimon and R. Yehudah hold elsewhere;</p></div>

Yehudah):</span> "V'Chiper (the Kohen Gadol sprinkles the blood of the bull and inner goat to atone for Teme'im who entered the following places) Es Mikdash ha'Kodesh" teaches about the Kodesh ha'Kodoshim. "Ohel Mo'ed" is the Heichal. "Ha'Mizbe'ach" is the Altar. "Yechaper" is extra, to teach about (entering) the Chatzer of the Mikdash;</p></div>
<div class="indent2"><span class="nm">2.</span><p><span class="cl">Version #2 - Rashi Kesav Yad - (Beraisa - R. Yehudah):</span> "V'Chiper (the Kohen Gadol sprinkles the bloods in the following places to atone for Tum'as Mikdash) Es Mikdash ha'Kodesh" teaches about (between the staves of the Aron, in) the Kodesh ha'Kodoshim. "Ohel Mo'ed" teaches about (towards the Paroches, while in) the Heichal. "Mizbe'ach" refers to the inner Mizbe'ach. "Yechaper" (is extra. It) teaches about (pouring the leftover blood on the base of the Mizbe'ach, which is in) the Chatzer; (end of Version #2)</p></div>
<div class="indent3"><span class="nm">i.</span><p>(The verse continues) "Kohanim... Am ha'Kahal (Yisraelim)...Yechaper" (to include Leviyim). Se'ir ha'Mishtale'ach atones equally for all of them.</p></div>
<div class="indent2"><span class="nm">3.</span><p>R. Shimon says, just like the blood of the inner goat atones for Yisraelim for Tum'ah (of the Mikdash or Kodshim). The blood of the bull atones for Kohanim for Tum'ah of the Mikdash or Kodshim;</p></div>

<div class="indent2"><span class="nm">5.</span><p><span class="cl">Answer:</span> Indeed, it teaches that they all get atonement for Tum'ah and other transgressions. however, they get atonement through different Korbanos.</p></div>
<div class="indent2"><span class="nm">6.</span><p><span class="cl">Summary:</span> According to R. Yehudah, blood of the inner goat for Yisraelim, and of the bull for Kohanim, atones for Tum'ah. Viduy over Se'ir ha'Mishtale'ach atones for all for other transgressions;</p></div>
<div class="indent3"><span class="nm">i.</span><p>R. Shimon only argues about atonement for Kohanim for other transgressions. He says that also this is through Viduy over the bull.</p></div>

<div class="indent1"><span class="nm">(d)</span><p><span class="cl">Rav Sheshes:</span> Beraisa #1 is erroneous. R. Shimon requires the Ba'alim to do Semichah!

<div class="indent1"><span class="nm">(e)</span><p><span class="cl">Question:</span> Why does R. Yehudah need a verse to exclude Se'irei Avodah Zarah? Ravina taught that a tradition teaches that Semichah applies to (exactly) two Korbanos Tzibur!</p></div>
<div class="indent1"><span class="nm">(f)</span><p><span class="cl">Version #1 - Rashi - Answer:</span> (He holds that) the verse is not really needed. It is merely an Asmachta.</p></div>

<div class="indent1"><span class="nm">(h)</span><p><span class="cl">Question:</span> What is R. Shimon's source that Se'irei Avodah Zarah require Semichah?</p></div>
<div class="indent1"><span class="nm">(i)</span><p><span class="cl">Answer (Beraisa - R. Yehudah):</span> "V'Samach Yado Al Rosh ha'Sa'ir" includes Se'ir Nachshon (a voluntary Chatas of Chanukas ha'Mishkan). Also it required Semichah;</p></div>
<div class="indent2"><span class="nm">1.</span><p>R. Shimon says, it includes Se'irei Avodah Zarah.</p></div>

<div class="indent2"><span class="nm">1.</span><p>If we had only the verses, one might have thought that Zivchei Shalmei Tzibur also require Semichah, from a Kal va'Chomer;</p></div>
<div class="indent2"><span class="nm">2.</span><p><span class="cl">(Mishnah - R. Shimon):</span> There are three Korbanos and three Mitzvos (exactly two Mitzvos apply to each...)</p></div>
<div class="indent2"><span class="nm">3.</span><p><span class="cl">Suggestion:</span> A Kal va'Chomer should teach that Shalmei Tzibur require Semichah!</p></div>
<div class="indent3"><span class="nm">i.</span><p>Shelamim does not require Tenufah mi'Chayim, yet it requires Semichah. Shalmei Tzibur require Tenufah mi'Chayim, all the more so they should require Semichah!</p></div>
<div class="indent2"><span class="nm">4.</span><p>Ravina's tradition refutes this suggestion. (Since we know that Par He'elam Davar and Se'irei Avodah Zarah require Semichah, there are no others.)</p></div>
<div class="indent1"><span class="nm">(l)</span><p>If we had only the tradition, we would not know which Korbanos Tzibur require Semichah (in addition to Par He'elam Davar, for which Semichah is explicit);</p></div>
<div class="indent2"><span class="nm">1.</span><p>"V'Samach Yado Al Rosh ha'Sa'ir" refers to a Nasi's Chatas, which is brought for a sin that became known. Surely, it teaches about a similar Chatas, i.e. Se'irei Avodah Zarah (and not Zivchei Shalmei Tzibur or the inner goat. "Ha'Chai" teaches that Aharon is Somech on Se'ir ha'Mishtale'ach, but not on Se'irei Avodah Zarah. Zekenim do Semichah on them.)</p></div>
