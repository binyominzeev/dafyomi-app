<p class="bas subject"><span class="nm">1)</span>DO WE ACT ACCORDING TO A RECEIPT? (cont.)</p>
<p class="bas indent1"><span class="nm">(a)</span><span class="cl">Question #4 (Beraisa):</span> A receipt that has witnesses is validated through the signatures.</p>
<p class="bas indent1"><span class="nm">(b)</span><span class="cl">Rejection:</span> It is validated (established) through asking the signers if the loan was paid.</p>
<p class="bas indent1"><span class="nm">(c)</span><span class="cl">Question #5 (Beraisa):</span> A receipt that has witnesses is Kosher.</p>
<p class="bas indent1"><span class="nm">(d)</span><span class="cl">Rejection:</span> It is Kosher if it has witnesses of a Henpek (a validation of Beis Din, for the loan was paid).</p>
<p class="bas indent1"><span class="nm">(e)</span><span class="cl">Support (for R. Yirmiyah - Seifa):</span> A receipt that has no witnesses is invalid.</p>
<p class="bas indent2"><span class="nm">1.</span>If is has no witnesses at all, this is obvious!</p>
<p class="bas indent2"><span class="nm">2.</span>Rather, it has no witnesses of validation (even though witnesses are signed on it).</p>
<p class="bas indent1"><span class="nm">(f)</span><span class="cl">(Beraisa):</span> A receipt which has witnesses is validated through the signatures;</p>
<p class="bas indent1"><span class="nm">(g)</span>If it has no witnesses, and a third party holds it or it is written on the loan document below the signatures, it is valid.</p>
<p class="bas indent2"><span class="nm">1.</span>If a third party holds it, it is valid, for the lender trusted the third party;</p>
<p class="bas indent2"><span class="nm">2.</span>If it is written on the loan document below the signatures, it is valid, for the lender would not allow them to taint his document unless he was really paid.</p>
<p class="perekline">PEREK ELU METZI'OS</p>
<p class="bas subject"><span class="nm">2)</span>WHICH <i>METZI'OS</i> MAY BE KEPT?</p>
<p class="bas indent1"><span class="nm">(a)</span><span class="cl">(Mishnah - R. Meir):</span> If one found any of the following, he may keep it: scattered Peros or coins, small bundles of sheaves in the Reshus ha'Rabim, rings of figs, baker's loaves, fish threaded on strings, pieces of meat, wool shearings, bundles of flax, and strips of purple wool;</p>
<p class="bas indent1"><span class="nm">(b)</span>R. Yehudah says, one must announce to return anything abnormal, such as a ring of figs with pottery inside.</p>
<p class="bas indent1"><span class="nm">(c)</span>R. Shimon ben Elazar says, one need not announce Anpurya Kelim (this will be explained).</p>
<p class="bas indent1"><span class="nm">(d)</span><span class="cl">(Gemara) Question:</span> How much scattered Peros may one keep?</p>
<p class="bas indent1"><span class="nm">(e)</span><span class="cl">Answer (R. Yitzchak):</span> One may keep one Kav (of grain) spread over four (by four) Amos.</p>
<p class="bas indent1"><span class="nm">(f)</span><span class="cl">Question:</span> What is the case?</p>
<p class="bas indent2"><span class="nm">1.</span>If it is scattered like Peros that fell, even if it is denser than this, he should be allowed to keep them!</p>
<p class="bas indent2"><span class="nm">2.</span>If it seems that it was placed down and did not fall, even if it is sparser than this, it should be forbidden to keep!</p>
<p class="bas indent1"><span class="nm">(g)</span><span class="cl">Answer (Rav Ukva bar Chama):</span> The case is, it was the time (Rashi; Rambam - place) of gathering the Peros (this was left over).</p>
<p class="bas indent2"><span class="nm">1.</span>If one Kav is spread over four Amos, the owner will not exert himself to gather it, and he makes it Hefker. If it is closer together than this, he gathers it.</p>
<p class="bas indent1"><span class="nm">(h)</span><span class="cl">Question (R. Yirmiyah):</span> If a half Kav is spread over two Amos (by four Amos; alternatively, by two Amos), what is the law?</p>
<p class="bas indent2"><span class="nm">1.</span>If the reason he does not gather one Kav in four Amos is because the exertion is too much, here (perhaps he would return for it, for) it is not so much exertion;</p>
<p class="bas indent2"><span class="nm">2.</span>If one does not gather one Kav in four Amos is because it is not worth very much, all the more so a half Kav spread over two Amos (he makes it Hefker).</p>
<p class="bas indent1"><span class="nm">(i)</span><span class="cl">Question:</span> If two Kavim are spread over eight Amos. what is the law?</p>
<p class="bas indent2"><span class="nm">1.</span>If one does not gather one Kav in four Amos is because the exertion is too much, all the more so here;</p>
<p class="bas indent2"><span class="nm">2.</span>If one does not gather one Kav in four Amos is because it is not worth very much, (perhaps here is different, for) two Kavim in eight Amos is worthwhile.</p>
<p class="bas indent1"><span class="nm">(j)</span><span class="cl">Question:</span> If a Kav of sesame is spread over four Amos, what is the law?</p>
<p class="bas indent2"><span class="nm">1.</span>If one does not gather one Kav (of grain) in four Amos is because it is not worth very much, (perhaps here is different, for) sesame is worth a lot;</p>
<p class="bas indent2"><span class="nm">2.</span>If one does not gather one Kav in four Amos is because the exertion is too much, all the more so sesame, which is hard to gather.</p>
<p class="bas indent1"><span class="nm">(k)</span><span class="cl">Question:</span> If a Kav of dates or pomegranates is spread over four Amos, what is the law?</p>
<p class="bas indent2"><span class="nm">1.</span>If one does not gather one Kav in four Amos is because the exertion is too much, (perhaps here is different, for) it is not so much exertion;</p>
<p class="bas indent2"><span class="nm">2.</span>If one does not gather one Kav in four Amos is because it is not worth very much, all the more so here!</p>
<p class="bas indent1"><span class="nm">(l)</span>These questions are unsettled.</p>
<p class="bas bbbline">21b----------------------------------------21b</p>
<p class="bas subject"><span class="nm">3)</span>SOMEONE WHO DOES NOT KNOW TO DESPAIR</p>
<p class="bas indent1"><span class="nm">(a)</span><span class="cl">(Abaye):</span> If one would despair from something if he knew that he dropped it, but he does not know that he dropped it, it is not considered as if he despaired;</p>
<p class="bas indent1"><span class="nm">(b)</span><span class="cl">(Rava):</span> It is as if he despaired.</p>
<p class="bas indent1"><span class="nm">(c)</span>If something has a Siman, no one considers it as if he despaired;</p>
<p class="bas indent2"><span class="nm">1.</span>Even if we heard him despair later, the finder may not keep it, since when he picked it up it was forbidden (to keep it. He was obligated to announce it to try to return it to the owner, for normally, one who something with a Siman expects to get it back by telling the Siman.)</p>
<p class="bas indent1"><span class="nm">(d)</span>If something was taken by a high tide or an overflowing river, all agree that even if it has a Siman, the Torah lets the finder keep it (like we will explain later).</p>
<p class="bas indent1"><span class="nm">(e)</span>They argue about something that has no Siman.</p>
<p class="bas indent2"><span class="nm">1.</span>Abaye does not consider it as if the owner despaired, because he does not know yet;</p>
<p class="bas indent2"><span class="nm">2.</span>Rava considers it as if the owner despaired, for when he finds out, he will despair.</p>
<p class="bas subject"><span class="nm">4)</span>ATTEMPTED PROOFS FOR RAVA</p>
<p class="bas indent1"><span class="nm">(a)</span>(We try to bring supports for Rava (which are questions against Abaye) from our Mishnah and other sources that permit keeping things, even though the owner might not know that he dropped them.)</p>
<p class="bas indent1"><span class="nm">(b)</span><span class="cl">Support (Mishnah):</span> If one found scattered Peros, he may keep them (even though the owner might not know that he lost them).</p>
<p class="bas indent1"><span class="nm">(c)</span><span class="cl">Rejection:</span> Rav Ukva bar Chama established the case to be leftover Peros at the time (or place) of gathering. The owner knows that he lost them.</p>
<p class="bas indent1"><span class="nm">(d)</span><span class="cl">Support (Mishnah):</span> Or scattered coins.</p>
<p class="bas indent1"><span class="nm">(e)</span><span class="cl">Rejection:</span> R. Yitzchak explained that this is because people constantly check their wallets. (Surely, the owner realized that he dropped them before the finder found them.)</p>
<p class="bas indent1"><span class="nm">(f)</span><span class="cl">Support (Mishnah):</span> Rings of figs or baker's loaves.</p>
<p class="bas indent1"><span class="nm">(g)</span><span class="cl">Rejection:</span> Since they are heavy, surely the owner realized that he dropped them.</p>
<p class="bas indent1"><span class="nm">(h)</span><span class="cl">Support (Mishnah):</span> Strips of purple wool.</p>
<p class="bas indent1"><span class="nm">(i)</span><span class="cl">Rejection:</span> Since they are valuable, people constantly feel (to check that they still have them), just like they check their wallets (according to R. Yitzchak).</p>
<p class="bas indent1"><span class="nm">(j)</span><span class="cl">Support (Beraisa):</span> If one finds coins in a Beis ha'Keneses, Beis Medrash or any place where many people go, he may keep them, because the owner despairs.</p>
<p class="bas indent1"><span class="nm">(k)</span><span class="cl">Rejection (R. Yitzchak):</span> This is because people constantly check their wallets.</p>
<p class="bas indent1"><span class="nm">(l)</span><span class="cl">Support (Mishnah):</span> Everyone (i.e. even rich people) may take Leket (grain that is dropped during harvesting, and must be left for the poor) after the Nemushos passed through.</p>
<p class="bas indent2"><span class="nm">1.</span><span class="cl">Question:</span> What are Nemushos?</p>
<p class="bas indent2"><span class="nm">2.</span><span class="cl">Answer #1 (R. Yochanan):</span> They are elderly people who walk on canes (they go slowly, and do not miss anything).</p>
<p class="bas indent2"><span class="nm">3.</span><span class="cl">Answer #2 (Reish Lakish):</span> They are the second wave of collectors.</p>
<p class="bas indent2"><span class="nm">4.</span>Even if poor people here know that they have passed through, Aniyim elsewhere do not and have not despaired (yet the Leket is permitted to all)!</p>
<p class="bas indent1"><span class="nm">(m)</span><span class="cl">Rejection:</span> Since there are Aniyim here, Aniyim elsewhere (assume that the Aniyim here will take all the Leket, and) despair from the outset.</p>
<p class="bas indent1"><span class="nm">(n)</span><span class="cl">(Mishnah):</span> If one finds fried figs on the road, even next to a field of drying figs, or figs found under a tree whose foliage leans over the Reshus ha'Rabim, he may keep them. They are exempt from Ma'aser;</p>
<p class="bas indent2"><span class="nm">1.</span>Regarding olives and carobs, they are forbidden.</p>
<p class="bas indent2"><span class="nm">2.</span>The Reisha is not difficult for Abaye. Since figs are valuable, the owner (constantly checks and) is aware once they fall.</p>
<p class="bas indent2"><span class="nm">3.</span>The Seifa refutes Rava!</p>
<p class="bas indent1"><span class="nm">(o)</span><span class="cl">Answer (R. Avahu):</span> Olives are recognizable (from whose tree they fell), so the owner does not despair.</p>
<p class="bas indent1"><span class="nm">(p)</span><span class="cl">Question:</span> If so, also regarding figs, the owners should not despair!</p>
<p class="bas indent1"><span class="nm">(q)</span><span class="cl">Answer (Rav Papa):</span> A fig becomes detestable when it falls.</p>
