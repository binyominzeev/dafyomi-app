<p class="bas subject"><span class="nm">1)</span><i>TUM'AH</i> BETWEEN <i>KORBANOS</i> AND SHAVING</p>
<p class="bas indent1"><span class="nm">(a)</span><span class="cl">(Mishnah - R. Eliezer):</span> If a Nazir became Tamei after the blood of one of his Korbanos was thrown on the Mizbe'ach, this cancels everything;</p>
<p class="bas indent1"><span class="nm">(b)</span>Chachamim say, he brings the other Korbanos and becomes Tahor.</p>
<p class="bas indent2"><span class="nm">1.</span><span class="cl">Chachamim:</span> A case occurred with Miryam from Tarmod. After the blood of one of her Korbanos was thrown, they told her that her daughter was dangerously sick. She went and found her dead. The sages ruled that she brings the other Korbanos and becomes Tehorah.</p>
<p class="bas indent1"><span class="nm">(c)</span><span class="cl">(Gemara) Question:</span> Why did R. Eliezer say that everything is cancelled? He holds that Tum'ah after the term of Nezirus nullifies only seven days!</p>
<p class="bas indent1"><span class="nm">(d)</span><span class="cl">Answer (Rav):</span> Indeed, he says that everything is cancelled, i.e. the Korbanos.</p>
<p class="bas indent1"><span class="nm">(e)</span><span class="cl">Support #1 (Seifa - Chachamim):</span> He brings the other Korbanos and becomes Tahor. (This shows that they argue about whether or not he was Yotzei the Korbanos.)</p>
<p class="bas indent1"><span class="nm">(f)</span><span class="cl">Support #2:</span> The Seifa brings a case in which a woman became Tamei, and Chachamim ruled that she brings the remaining Korbanos.</p>

<p class="bas subject"><span class="nm">2)</span>WHEN <i>TUM'AH</i> IS PERMITTED</p>
<p class="bas indent1"><span class="nm">(a)</span><span class="cl">(Mishnah):</span> A Kohen Gadol or a Nazir may not be Metamei for a relative who died. He may be Metamei for a Mes Mitzvah;</p>
<p class="bas indent1"><span class="nm">(b)</span>R. Eliezer says, if a Kohen Gadol and a Nazir found a Mes Mitzvah on the road, the Kohen Gadol should be Metamei to bury him, not the Nazir;</p>
<p class="bas indent1"><span class="nm">(c)</span>Chachamim say, the Nazir should bury him.</p>
<p class="bas indent2"><span class="nm">1.</span><span class="cl">R. Eliezer:</span> The Kohen should be Metamei, for he does not bring a Korban for Tum'ah!</p>
<p class="bas indent2"><span class="nm">2.</span><span class="cl">Chachamim:</span> The Nazir should be Metamei, for his Kedushah is not permanent. A Kohen's Kedushah is permanent!</p>
<p class="bas indent1"><span class="nm">(d)</span><span class="cl">(Gemara):</span> When a Kohen Gadol and Nazir are together, the Tana'im in our Mishnah argue about who has precedence (and should not be Metamei).</p>
<p class="bas bbbline">47b----------------------------------------47b</p>
<p class="bas indent1"><span class="nm">(e)</span>A Kohen Mashu'ach (anointed with Kodesh oil) has precedence over a Merubah Begadim (a Kohen Gadol inaugurated only through wearing the additional garments of a Kohen Gadol), for only a Mashu'ach brings a bull if he sinned due to a mistaken ruling;</p>
<p class="bas indent1"><span class="nm">(f)</span>A Merubah Begadim has precedence over a Kohen Mashu'ach who once substituted for the Kohen Gadol on Yom Kipur, for the former can still serve in the Mikdash, but the latter cannot.</p>
<p class="bas indent1"><span class="nm">(g)</span>A Kohen who cannot serve due to Tamei due to an emission has precedence over one who cannot serve due to a blemish, for the former can serve tomorrow, but the latter cannot.</p>
<p class="bas indent1"><span class="nm">(h)</span><span class="cl">Question:</span> Who has precedence among a Mashu'ach Milchamah (the Kohen who speaks to the soldiers in war) and a Sgan (the Kohen prepared to substitute for the Kohen Gadol if necessary)?</p>
<p class="bas indent2"><span class="nm">1.</span>Perhaps the former has precedence, for he serves a need in war.</p>
<p class="bas indent2"><span class="nm">2.</span>Or, perhaps the Sgan has precedence, for he can serve in the Mikdash.</p>
<p class="bas indent1"><span class="nm">(i)</span><span class="cl">Answer (Beraisa #1):</span> The only difference between a Mashu'ach Milchamah and a Sgan Gadol is that if they chance upon a Mes Mitzvah, the former becomes Tamei.</p>
<p class="bas indent1"><span class="nm">(j)</span><span class="cl">Contradiction (Beraisa #2):</span> The Mashu'ach Milchamah has precedence.</p>
<p class="bas indent1"><span class="nm">(k)</span><span class="cl">Answer (Mar Zutra):</span> The Mashu'ach Milchamah has precedence to be sustained, for many depend on him. Regarding Tum'ah, the Sgan has precedence:</p>
<p class="bas indent2"><span class="nm">1.</span><span class="cl">(Beraisa - R. Chanina ben Antigonus):</span> A Sgan is appointed, in case the Kohen Gadol will be Metamei (on Yom Kipur); the Sgan will serve in his place.</p>
<p class="bas subject"><span class="nm">3)</span>PERMISSION TO BURY A <i>MES</i> <i>MITZVAH</i></p>
<p class="bas indent1"><span class="nm">(a)</span><span class="cl">Inference:</span> Tana'im argue about who has precedence, but if a Kohen Gadol or Nazir was alone, he may bury a Mes Mitzvah.</p>
<p class="bas indent1"><span class="nm">(b)</span><span class="cl">Question:</span> What is the source of this?</p>
<p class="bas indent1"><span class="nm">(c)</span><span class="cl">Answer (Beraisa) Question:</span> "(A Kohen Gadol) will not come upon any dead souls" - what does the verse discuss?</p>
<p class="bas indent2"><span class="nm">1.</span>It need not teach that he may not be Metamei for strangers. A Kal v'Chomer teaches this!</p>
<p class="bas indent3"><span class="nm">i.</span>A regular Kohen may be Metamei for relatives, but not for strangers. A Kohen Gadol may not be Metamei for relatives, all the more so he may not for strangers!</p>
<p class="bas indent2"><span class="nm">2.</span><span class="cl">Answer:</span> Rather, it teaches that he may not be Metamei for relatives.</p>
<p class="bas indent2"><span class="nm">3.</span>"For his father" he may not be Metamei, but he may be Metamei for a Mes Mitzvah!</p>
