<p class="bas indent1"><span class="nm">(a)</span><span class="cl">(Beraisa - Aba Binyamin):</span> If a person could see the Mazikin around him, he would not be able to bear the fright.</p>
<p class="bas indent1"><span class="nm">(b)</span><span class="cl">(Abaye):</span> There are more Mazikin than people; they surround us like a furrow around a vine.</p>
<p class="bas indent1"><span class="nm">(c)</span><span class="cl">(Rav Huna):</span> Everyone has 1,000 Mazikin on his left, and 10,000 on his right.</p>
<p class="bas indent1"><span class="nm">(d)</span><span class="cl">(Rava):</span> They cause the cramped conditions at Kalah (gatherings of Talmidim on Shabbosim before Pesach and Sukos), weakness of knees, and knocking of feet; they sit next to (and rub against) Talmidim, causing Talmidim's garments to fray.</p>
<p class="bas indent1"><span class="nm">(e)</span>If one wants to verify their presence, he should put ground ashes around his bed; in the morning, he will see footprints resembling those of a chicken.</p>
<p class="bas indent1"><span class="nm">(f)</span>To see the Mazikin, one should burn a fetal sac of a cat (meeting certain other conditions) and put the ashes on his eye;</p>
<p class="bas indent2"><span class="nm">1.</span>Rav Bivi bar Abaye did so, and they damaged him; Rabanan prayed for him, he recovered.</p>
<p class="bas subject"><span class="nm">2)</span>PLACES WHERE THE SHECHINAH IS FOUND</p>
<p class="bas indent1"><span class="nm">(a)</span><span class="cl">(Beraisa - Aba Binyamin):</span> A person's prayer is heard only if he prays in synagogue:</p>
<p class="bas indent2"><span class="nm">1.</span>"Lishmo'a El ha'Rinah v'El ha'Tefilah" -- the place where we sing (Hash-m's praises) is the proper place for Tefilah.</p>
<p class="bas indent1"><span class="nm">(b)</span><span class="cl">Question (Ravin bar Rav Ada):</span> What is the source that Hash-m is found in synagogues?</p>
<p class="bas indent1"><span class="nm">(c)</span><span class="cl">Answer:</span> "Elokim Nitzav ba'Adas Kel."</p>
<p class="bas indent2"><span class="nm">1.</span>This also teaches that the Shechinah is with ten people who pray together.</p>
<p class="bas indent1"><span class="nm">(d)</span><span class="cl">Question:</span> What is the source that the Shechinah is with three who judge a case?</p>
<p class="bas indent1"><span class="nm">(e)</span><span class="cl">Answer:</span> "B'Kerev Elokim Yishpot."</p>
<p class="bas indent1"><span class="nm">(f)</span><span class="cl">Question:</span> What is the source that the Shechinah is with two people learning Torah together?</p>
<p class="bas indent1"><span class="nm">(g)</span><span class="cl">Answer:</span> "Az Nidberu Yir'ei Hash-m Ish El Re'ehu va'Yakshev Hash-m..."</p>
<p class="bas indent2"><span class="nm">1.</span><span class="cl">Question:</span> What do we learn from the continuation, "ul'Choshvei Shemo"?</p>
<p class="bas indent2"><span class="nm">2.</span><span class="cl">Answer (Rav Ashi):</span> If a person Chashav (intended) to do a Mitzvah and was unable to, the verse considers it as though he did it.</p>
<p class="bas indent1"><span class="nm">(h)</span><span class="cl">Question:</span> What is the source that the Shechinah is with even one person learning Torah?</p>
<p class="bas indent1"><span class="nm">(i)</span><span class="cl">Answer:</span> "B'Chol Makom Asher Azkir Es Shemi Avo Elecha u'Verachticha."</p>
<p class="bas indent1"><span class="nm">(j)</span><span class="cl">Question:</span> Since the Shechinah is with even one person learning, why must a verse teach that it is with two?</p>
<p class="bas indent1"><span class="nm">(k)</span><span class="cl">Answer:</span> When there are two, Hash-m records their words in a Sefer, but not when there is only one.</p>
<p class="bas indent1"><span class="nm">(l)</span><span class="cl">Question:</span> Since the Shechinah is with two, why must a verse teach about three? (Sitting in judgment is also learning Torah!)</p>
<p class="bas indent1"><span class="nm">(m)</span><span class="cl">Answer:</span> One might have thought that judgment is merely making peace between people -- the verse teaches that it is also Torah.</p>
<p class="bas indent1"><span class="nm">(n)</span><span class="cl">Question:</span> Since the Shechinah is with even three, why must a verse teach that it is with ten?</p>
<p class="bas indent1"><span class="nm">(o)</span><span class="cl">Answer:</span> When there are ten, the Shechinah comes before them; when there are only three, the Shechinah does not come until they begin to judge.</p>

<p class="bas indent1"><span class="nm">(a)</span><span class="cl">Question (Ravin bar Rav Ada):</span> What is the source that Hash-m wears Tefilin? (Obviously, His Tefilin are not physical.)</p>
<p class="bas indent1"><span class="nm">(b)</span><span class="cl">Answer:</span> "Nishba Hash-m bi'Yemino" refers to Torah; "uvi'Zero'a Uzo" refers to Tefilin -- "Hash-m Oz l'Amo Yiten."</p>

<p class="bas indent1"><span class="nm">(l)</span><span class="cl">Answer (Rav Ashi):</span> There are two pairs of similar verses, each pair is together in one Bayis -- "Ki Mi Goy Gadol" and "u'Mi Goy Gadol," and "u'Mi k'Amcha Yisrael" and "Ashrecha Yisrael."</p>

<p class="bas indent1"><span class="nm">(a)</span><span class="cl">(Ravin bar Rav Ada):</span> If one normally comes to synagogues, and one day he does not come, Hash-m inquires about him -- "Mi Vachem Yerei Hash-m... Asher Halach Chashechim v'Ein Nogah Lo";</p>
<p class="bas indent2"><span class="nm">1.</span>If he went to do a Mitzvah, he will have Nogah (light); if not, he will not.</p>
<p class="bas indent2"><span class="nm">2.</span>"Yivtach b'Shem Hash-m" -- this shows why he will not have light, for he should have trusted in Hash-m (that he will not lose by coming to synagogue.)</p>
<p class="bas indent1"><span class="nm">(b)</span><span class="cl">(R. Yochanan):</span> If Hash-m comes to synagogue and does not find ten people (at the time for prayer), He gets angry -- "Madu'a Basi v'Ein Ish, Karasi v'Ein Oneh."</p>
<p class="bas indent1"><span class="nm">(c)</span><span class="cl">(R. Chelbo):</span> Anyone who has a fixed a place for Tefilah, the G-d of Avraham helps him; when he dies, he is called humble, a Chasid, a Talmid of Avraham.</p>
<p class="bas indent1"><span class="nm">(d)</span><span class="cl">Question:</span> What is the source that Avraham fixed a place for Tefilah?</p>
<p class="bas indent1"><span class="nm">(e)</span><span class="cl">Answer:</span> "Va'Yashkem Avraham ba'Boker El ha'Makom Asher Amad Sham";</p>
<p class="bas indent2"><span class="nm">1.</span>"Amidah" is prayer -- "va'Ya'amod Pinchos va'Yefalel."</p>
<p class="bas indent1"><span class="nm">(f)</span><span class="cl">(R. Chelbo):</span> One who leaves a synagogue should not take big steps (it looks like being in synagogue was a burden to him);</p>
<p class="bas indent1"><span class="nm">(g)</span><span class="cl">(Abaye):</span> This applies to leaving, but it is a Mitzvah to run to synagogue -- "Nirdefah Lada'as Es Hash-m."</p>
<p class="bas indent1"><span class="nm">(h)</span><span class="cl">(R. Zeira):</span> At first, when I saw Talmidim running to the Kalah (public lecture before the festival), I thought that they were disgracing Shabbos;</p>
<p class="bas indent2"><span class="nm">1.</span>Later, I heard R. Tanchum teach that one should run to learn (some texts - to do a Mitzvah), even on Shabbos -- "Acharei Hash-m Yelchu k'Aryeh Yish'ag" -- now also I run.</p>
<p class="bas indent1"><span class="nm">(i)</span><span class="cl">(R. Zeira):</span> The primary reward for hearing a Torah discourse is for running to it (because most people will not understand it well enough to repeat it);</p>
<p class="bas indent2"><span class="nm">1.</span><span class="cl">(Abaye):</span> The primary reward for attending the Kalah is for suffering the cramped conditions;</p>
<p class="bas indent2"><span class="nm">2.</span><span class="cl">(Rava):</span> The primary reward for learning is for struggling to understand;</p>
<p class="bas indent2"><span class="nm">3.</span><span class="cl">(Rav Papa):</span> The primary reward for visiting mourners is for being silent;</p>
<p class="bas indent2"><span class="nm">4.</span><span class="cl">(Mar Zutra):</span> The primary reward for a fast is the Tzedakah that one gives (afterwards to the Aniyim who fasted);</p>
<p class="bas indent2"><span class="nm">5.</span><span class="cl">(Rav Sheshes):</span> The primary reward for a eulogy is for making people cry;</p>
<p class="bas indent2"><span class="nm">6.</span><span class="cl">(Rav Ashi):</span> The primary reward for attending a wedding is for words (that gladden the Chasan).</p>
<p class="bas indent1"><span class="nm">(j)</span><span class="cl">(Rav Huna):</span> One who prays behind a synagogue is called a Rasha -- "Saviv Resha'im Yis'halachun";</p>
<p class="bas indent1"><span class="nm">(k)</span><span class="cl">(Abaye):</span> This is only if he does not face the synagogue (for then he faces the opposite direction from the congregation); if he faces the synagogue, it is fine.</p>
<p class="bas indent1"><span class="nm">(l)</span>A certain man prayed in back of a synagogue and did not face the synagogue; Eliyahu appeared to him like an Arab merchant.</p>
<p class="bas indent2"><span class="nm">1.</span><span class="cl">Eliyahu:</span> You make it seem like there are two powers (for you pray to the opposite direction from the congregation)!</p>

<p class="bas indent1"><span class="nm">(n)</span><span class="cl">Answer #1 (Rav Bivi bar Abaye):</span> This refers to things that are at the RoM (peak of importance) of the world, yet people MeZaLZeL (disgrace) them.</p>
<p class="bas indent1"><span class="nm">(o)</span><span class="cl">Answer #2 (R. Yochanan and R. Elazar):</span> Once a person must take money from others, his face turns to Kerum.</p>

<p class="bas indent2"><span class="nm">2.</span><span class="cl">Answer (Rav Dimi):</span> It is a coastal bird; when the sun shines on it, it turns to many colors.</p>
<p class="bas indent1"><span class="nm">(p)</span><span class="cl">(R. Ami and R. Asi):</span> If a person must take money from others, it is as if he was punished with fire and water -- "Hirkavta Enosh l'Rosheinu Banu va'Esh uva'Mayim."</p>
<p class="bas subject"><span class="nm">5)</span>THINGS TO BE CAREFUL ABOUT</p>
<p class="bas indent1"><span class="nm">(a)</span><span class="cl">(R. Chelbo):</span> A person should be very careful about Minchah, for this is when Eliyahu was answered -- "va'Yehi ba'Alos ha'Minchah va'Yigash Eliyahu... Aneni Hash-m Aneni";</p>
<p class="bas indent2"><span class="nm">1.</span>He asked Hash-m to bring fire from the heavens to consume everything on the Mizbe'ach, and to distract people, so they will not say that it was done through witchcraft.</p>
<p class="bas indent1"><span class="nm">(b)</span><span class="cl">(R. Yochanan):</span> A person should also be very careful about Ma'ariv -- "Tikon Tefilasi Ketores... Minchas Arev" (what I pray at night should be like a Minchah);</p>
<p class="bas indent1"><span class="nm">(c)</span><span class="cl">(Rav Nachman bar Yitzchak):</span> A person should also be very careful about Shacharis -- "Hash-m Boker Tishma Koli."</p>
<p class="bas indent1"><span class="nm">(d)</span><span class="cl">(R.

<p class="bas indent1"><span class="nm">(e)</span><span class="cl">Question:</span> If he did gladden the Chasan, what is his reward?</p>
<p class="bas indent1"><span class="nm">(f)</span><span class="cl">Answer #1 (R. Yehoshua ben Levi):</span> He merits Torah, which was given with five Kolos -- "va'Yehi va'Yom ha'Shelishi...

<p class="bas indent1"><span class="nm">(g)</span><span class="cl">Answer #2 (R. Avahu):</span> It is as if he offered a Korban Todah -- [the verse "Kol Sason v'Kol Simchah..." continues:] "Mevi'im Todah Beis Hash-m."</p>
<p class="bas indent1"><span class="nm">(h)</span><span class="cl">Answer #3 (Rav Nachman bar Yitzchak):</span> It is as if he rebuilt a ruin of Yerushalayim -- "Ki Ashiv Es Shevus ha'Aretz keva'Rishonah."</p>
<p class="bas indent1"><span class="nm">(i)</span><span class="cl">(R. Chelbo):</span> If someone fears Shamayim, his words are heard -- "Sof Davar ha'Kol Nishma Es ha'Elokim Yera";</p>
<p class="bas indent1"><span class="nm">(j)</span><span class="cl">Question:</span> What does the end of the verse, "Ki Zeh Kol ha'Adam," mean?</p>
<p class="bas indent1"><span class="nm">(k)</span><span class="cl">Answer #1 (R. Elazar):</span> The entire world was created for the sake of even one such person.</p>
<p class="bas indent1"><span class="nm">(l)</span><span class="cl">Answer #2 (Rav Aba bar Kahana):</span> Such a person is worth as much as the entire world.</p>
<p class="bas indent1"><span class="nm">(m)</span><span class="cl">Answer #3 (Ben Azai):</span> The entire world was created to accompany such a person.</p>
<p class="bas indent1"><span class="nm">(n)</span><span class="cl">(R. Chelbo):</span> If you know that a person normally greets you with "Shalom," you should greet him first -- "Bakesh Shalom v'Radfehu."</p>
