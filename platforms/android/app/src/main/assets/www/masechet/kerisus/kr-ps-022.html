<p class="bas subject"><span class="nm">1)</span>BLOOD FOR WHICH ONE IS NOT LIABLE</p>
<p class="bas indent1"><span class="nm">(a)</span><span class="cl">Version #2 (Beraisa) Suggestion:</span> Human milk should be forbidden;</p>
<p class="bas indent2"><span class="nm">1.</span>A Kal va'Chomer should forbid it! We are lenient about Maga of Tamei animals (they cannot become Tamei while alive. Zivah and Nidah do not apply to them), yet we forbid the milk of non-Kosher animals. We are stringent about Maga of people, all the more so their milk should be forbidden!</p>
<p class="bas indent2"><span class="nm">2.</span><span class="cl">Rejection:</span> "<i>Zeh</i> Lachem ha'Tamei" teaches that these (Tamei animals) are forbidden, but not human milk.</p>
<p class="bas indent1"><span class="nm">(b)</span><span class="cl">Suggestion:</span> Perhaps human milk is permitted, for it is found only in females, but human blood, which is even in males, is forbidden!</p>
<p class="bas indent1"><span class="nm">(c)</span><span class="cl">Rejection (Rav Sheshes):</span> There is no Mitzvah to refrain from eating human blood, not even a mere stringency.</p>
<p class="bas indent1"><span class="nm">(d)</span><span class="cl">(Mishnah):</span> One tears the heart to remove the blood. If it was not torn, he does not transgress.</p>
<p class="bas indent1"><span class="nm">(e)</span><span class="cl">(Rav):</span> This applies only to the heart of a bird, for it does not have a k'Zayis of blood. The heart of an animal has a k'Zayis of blood, one is Chayav Kares for it.</p>
<p class="bas indent1"><span class="nm">(f)</span><span class="cl">Question (Beraisa):</span> A Lav forbids the following bloods -- of the spleen, heart, kidneys, and limbs;</p>
<p class="bas indent2"><span class="nm">1.</span>The following are forbidden, but one is not liable for them -- blood of people, Sheratzim and Remashim.</p>
<p class="bas indent1"><span class="nm">(g)</span><span class="cl">Answer:</span> The Beraisa discusses blood of the heart itself. Rav discusses (circulating) blood that entered (the chambers of) the heart.</p>
<p class="bas indent1"><span class="nm">(h)</span><span class="cl">Question:</span> Blood of the heart itself is just like blood of (other) limbs, which is explicitly taught!</p>
<p class="bas indent2"><span class="nm">1.</span><span class="cl">Counter-question:</span> Blood of the kidneys is blood of limbs, yet both are explicitly taught!</p>
<p class="bas indent1"><span class="nm">(i)</span><span class="cl">Answer to both questions:</span> We must say that the Beraisa taught Peratim, and later taught a Klal including the Peratim.</p>
<p class="bas indent1"><span class="nm">(j)</span><span class="cl">Question:</span> (Kares is only for Dam ha'Nefesh. When the animal is dying,) from where would blood come to the chambers of the heart?</p>
<p class="bas indent1"><span class="nm">(k)</span><span class="cl">Answer (R. Zeira):</span> When the animal is dying, blood is sucked from the neck to the heart.</p>
<p class="bas subject"><span class="nm">2)</span>DAM HA'NEFESH AND DAM TAMTZIS</p>
<p class="bas indent1"><span class="nm">(a)</span><span class="cl">(Mishnah):</span> One is liable for Dam (ha'Nefesh, i.e.) that exudes at the time of death.</p>
<p class="bas indent1"><span class="nm">(b)</span><span class="cl">Question:</span> What are the Simanim of Dam ha'Nefesh of bloodletting?</p>
<p class="bas indent1"><span class="nm">(c)</span><span class="cl">Answer #1 (R. Yochanan):</span> The entire time it is flowing (it is Dam ha'Nefesh);</p>
<p class="bas indent1"><span class="nm">(d)</span><span class="cl">Answer #2 (Reish Lakish):</span> It is from the first black drop and onwards.</p>
<p class="bas indent1"><span class="nm">(e)</span><span class="cl">Question (against Reish Lakish - Beraisa):</span> Dam ha'Nefesh of bloodletting is when it is flowing;</p>
<p class="bas indent2"><span class="nm">1.</span>Dam Tamtzis is when it drips.</p>
<p class="bas indent2"><span class="nm">2.</span><span class="cl">Suggestion:</span> What drips is Dam Tamtzis, whether this is before or after what flows.</p>
<p class="bas indent1"><span class="nm">(f)</span><span class="cl">Answer:</span> No, it excludes only black blood. What comes (after this,) before or after what flows, is Dam ha'Nefesh, even if it drips.</p>
<p class="bas indent1"><span class="nm">(g)</span><span class="cl">Question (against Reish Lakish - Beraisa):</span> Dam ha'Nefesh (text of Shitah) is when it is flowing. This excludes what is before and after this, for it drips.</p>
<p class="bas indent1"><span class="nm">(h)</span><span class="cl">Answer:</span> Tana'im argue about this:</p>
<p class="bas indent2"><span class="nm">1.</span><span class="cl">(Beraisa - R. Elazar):</span> Dam ha'Nefesh is when it is flowing;</p>
<p class="bas indent2"><span class="nm">2.</span>R. Shimon says, it is from the first black drop and onwards.</p>
<p class="bas indent1"><span class="nm">(i)</span><span class="cl">(Tana d'Vei R. Yishmael):</span> "V'Dam Chalalim Yishteh" teaches that blood that exudes after death is a Mashkeh and is Machshir, but not what flows.</p>
<p class="bas indent1"><span class="nm">(j)</span><span class="cl">Question (R. Yirmeyah):</span> If one let blood from an animal and collected the blood in two cups, what is the law?</p>
<p class="bas indent2"><span class="nm">1.</span>All agree that one is liable for (eating) the first. (It includes Dam ha'Nefesh.) Is one liable for the second?</p>
<p class="bas indent1"><span class="nm">(k)</span><span class="cl">Answer (R. Zeira):</span> R. Yochanan and Reish Lakish argue about this:</p>
<p class="bas indent2"><span class="nm">1.</span><span class="cl">(Reish Lakish):</span> If one let blood from an animal and collected the blood in two cups, he is liable for (eating) both. (After it blackens, all blood is Dam ha'Nefesh);</p>
<p class="bas indent2"><span class="nm">2.</span><span class="cl">(R. Yochanan):</span> He is liable only once. (perhaps all of the blood in the second cup dripped).</p>
<p class="bas indent1"><span class="nm">(l)</span><span class="cl">(Mishnah - R. Yehudah):</span> One is liable for Dam Tamtzis.</p>
<p class="bas indent1"><span class="nm">(m)</span><span class="cl">(R. Elazar):</span> R. Yehudah agrees that Dam Tamtzis is invalid for Kaparah. "Ki ha'Dam Hu ba'Nefesh Yechaper"  teaches that only blood that exudes when the animal dies is Mechaper.</p>
<p class="bas indent1"><span class="nm">(n)</span>Support (Rav Nachman bar Yitzchak - Beraisa) Question: What do we learn from "<i>Kol</i> Dam"?</p>
<p class="bas indent2"><span class="nm">1.</span><span class="cl">Answer - Question:</span> Perhaps "Ki ha'Dam Hu ba'Nefesh Yechaper" teaches that one might have thought that one is liable only for Dam ha'Nefesh of Kodshim.  What is the source to be Mechayev for Dam Chulin and Dam Tamtzis?</p>
<p class="bas indent2"><span class="nm">2.</span><span class="cl">Answer:</span> "Kol Dam" includes these.</p>

<p class="bas subject"><span class="nm">3)</span>SAFEK ME'ILAH</p>
<p class="bas indent1"><span class="nm">(a)</span><span class="cl">(Mishnah - R. Akiva):</span> One brings Asham Taluy for Safek Me'ilah;</p>
<p class="bas indent1"><span class="nm">(b)</span>Chachamim exempt.</p>
<p class="bas indent1"><span class="nm">(c)</span><span class="cl">Version #1 (Rashi):</span> R. Akiva agrees that he does not bring Me'ilaso (Keren, the value of what he benefitted from Hekdesh) and an added Chomesh) until he finds out (that he definitely transgressed), then he brings it with Asham Vadai.</p>
<p class="bas indent1"><span class="nm">(d)</span><span class="cl">Version #2 (R. Gershom):</span> R. Akiva agrees that if he wants, he need not bring Keren, Chomesh or Asham Taluy until he finds out, then he brings the money, Chomesh and Asham Vadai. (end of Version #2)</p>
<p class="bas indent1"><span class="nm">(e)</span><span class="cl">R. Tarfon:</span> Why should he bring two Ashamos?! Rather, he brings the money, Chomesh and an Asham worth at least two Shekalim and stipulates:</p>
<p class="bas indent2"><span class="nm">1.</span>If I truly transgressed, this is the money and Asham I must bring;</p>
<p class="bas indent2"><span class="nm">2.</span>If it is a doubt (this will be explained), the money is for Nedavah, and the Asham is Asham Taluy.</p>
<p class="bas indent2"><span class="nm">3.</span>(He can do so because) the same Korban brought for definite Me'ilah is brought for a Safek.</p>
<p class="bas indent1"><span class="nm">(f)</span><span class="cl">R. Akiva:</span> That is reasonable if the (Keren of Safek) Me'ilah was small (perhaps he pays the money needlessly, but this saves him from bringing a second Korban);</p>
<p class="bas indent2"><span class="nm">1.</span>if the Me'ilah was (large, e.g.) 100 Manos, it is better to bring Asham Taluy for two Shekalim and not to pay 100 Manos that he might not owe!</p>
<p class="bas indent1"><span class="nm">(g)</span>R. Akiva agrees with R. Tarfon regarding a small Me'ilah.</p>

<p class="bas indent1"><span class="nm">(j)</span><span class="cl">Suggestion:</span> R. Akiva holds that Lemedim Elyon mi'Tachton (we learn about a Parshah from the following Parshah. The Parshah of Me'ilah is followed by Asham Taluy, to teach that Asham Taluy applies to Me'ilah), and Chachamim hold that Ein Lemedim Elyon mi'Tachton.</p>
<p class="bas indent1"><span class="nm">(k)</span><span class="cl">Rejection (Rav Papa):</span> No, all agree that Lemedim Elyon mi'Tachton. We have no other source that cattle (for Olah or Chatas) must be slaughtered in the north (half of the Azarah. Surely, all agree to this law)!</p>
<p class="bas indent2"><span class="nm">1.</span>Rather, Chachamim learn a Gezeirah Shavah "Mitzvos-Mitzvos" from Chatas (Chelev) - just like there, it discusses something punishable by Kares if Mezid and Chatas if Shogeg, also Asham Taluy is brought only for Safek of such an Aveirah;</p>
<p class="bas indent2"><span class="nm">2.</span>One is not Chayav Kares for Me'ilah;</p>
<p class="bas indent3"><span class="nm">i.</span><span class="cl">(Beraisa - Rebbi):</span> If one transgressed Me'ilah b'Mezid, he is Chayav Misah b'Yedei Shamayim;</p>
<p class="bas indent3"><span class="nm">ii.</span>Chachamim say, he transgressed a (mere) Lav.</p>
<p class="bas indent2"><span class="nm">3.</span>R. Akiva learns from the Gezeirah Shavah that Asham Taluy is brought for an Aveirah that obligates a Korban Kavu'a (it is the same for rich and poor), not for an Aveirah that obligates a Korban Oleh v'Yored;</p>
<p class="bas indent2"><span class="nm">4.</span>Chachamim hold that Ein Gezeirah Shavah l'Mechetzah. (We learn all possible laws from a Gezeirah Shavah, in both directions);</p>

<p class="bas indent2"><span class="nm">1.</span>R. Akiva learns from "<i>v</i>'Im Nefesh" - the "Vav" connects the Parshiyos, and Lemedim Elyon mi'Tachton;</p>
<p class="bas indent2"><span class="nm">2.</span>Chachamim use the "Vav" to teach that Lemedim Tachton mi'Elyon, that Asham Taluy must be worth at least two Shekalim, just like Asham Me'ilos.</p>
<p class="bas indent2"><span class="nm">3.</span>R. Akiva holds Ein Hekesh l'Mechtzah (we learn Elyon mi'Tachton <i>and</i> Tachton mi'Elyon).</p>
<p class="bas indent1"><span class="nm">(m)</span><span class="cl">Objection:</span> This implies that Chachamim hold Yesh Hekesh l'Mechtzah. This is not the Halachah!</p>
<p class="bas indent1"><span class="nm">(n)</span><span class="cl">Retraction:</span> Rather, all agree that Ein Hekesh l'Mechtzah;</p>
<p class="bas indent2"><span class="nm">1.</span>Chachamim say that the Gezeirah Shavah "Mitzvos-Mitzvos" overrides the Hekesh.</p>
<p class="bas indent2"><span class="nm">2.</span>R. Akiva learns from "Zos Toras ha'Asham" that all Ashamos have the same law. They must cost at least two Shekalim.</p>
<p class="bas indent2"><span class="nm">3.</span>Chachamim require "Vav" Mosif. From "Zos Toras ha'Asham" we would learn only Ashamos Vadai, but not Asham Taluy, for it should not be more stringent than the Chatas one would bring had he definitely sinned, which can be bought for a sixth of a Dinar (or even less). The Hekesh equates Asham Taluy to Asham Vadai.</p>
<p class="bas indent1"><span class="nm">(o)</span><span class="cl">Question:</span> This is like the opinion that expounds "Zos Toras ha'Asham." How does the opposing opinion explain R. Akiva?</p>
<p class="bas indent1"><span class="nm">(p)</span><span class="cl">Answer:</span> He learns from a Gezeirah Shavah "b'Erkecha-b'Erkecha" from Asham Me'ilah.</p>
<p class="bas indent1"><span class="nm">(q)</span><span class="cl">Question:</span> This does not teach about Asham Shifchah Charufah, regarding which it does not say "b'Erkecha"!</p>

<p class="bas indent1"><span class="nm">(b)</span><span class="cl">Question:</span> What does this mean?</p>
<p class="bas indent1"><span class="nm">(c)</span><span class="cl">Answer (Rava):</span> It should say 'if my doubt will never be resolved, the Asham is Asham Taluy.'</p>
<p class="bas indent1"><span class="nm">(d)</span><span class="cl">(Mishnah):</span> (He can do so because) the same Korban brought for definite Me'ilah is brought for a Safek.</p>
<p class="bas indent1"><span class="nm">(e)</span><span class="cl">Question:</span> When he finds out that he sinned, he should have to bring Asham Vadai! (This is like one who brought Asham Taluy for a Safek Kares. He brings a Chatas if he learns that he truly sinned.)</p>
<p class="bas indent1"><span class="nm">(f)</span><span class="cl">Answer (Rava):</span> We learn from R. Akiva and R. Tarfon that Asham Vadai does not require Yedi'ah when it is brought. (He is Yotzei, even though he was in doubt at the time.)</p>
