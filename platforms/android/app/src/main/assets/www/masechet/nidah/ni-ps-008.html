<p class="bas subject"><span class="nm">1)</span>OTHER PLACES WHERE THE HALACHAH FOLLOWS R. ELIEZER</p>
<p class="bas indent1"><span class="nm">(a)</span><span class="cl">Question:</span> Are these the only places in which the Halachah follows R. Eliezer?!</p>
<p class="bas indent2"><span class="nm">1.</span><span class="cl">(Mishnah - R. Eliezer):</span> (When a woman falls to Yibum, her relatives are forbidden to the Yavam as if she was Mekudeshes to the Yavam.) If Rachel was an orphaned minor married mid'Rabanan to Reuven, and her sister Leah (an adult) was married (mid'Oraisa) to his brother Shimon, and Shimon died (without children), Rachel becomes forbidden to Reuven (as if Leah was married to him). We instruct Rachel to do Mi'un (retroactively annul her marriage, which permits Leah to do Yibum).</p>
<p class="bas indent2"><span class="nm">2.</span><span class="cl">(Shmuel):</span> The Halachah follows R. Eliezer.</p>
<p class="bas indent1"><span class="nm">(b)</span><span class="cl">Answer:</span> Shmuel meant that the Halachah follows R. Eliezer only in four places in Seder Taharos. In other Sedarim, the Halachah follows him in additional places.</p>
<p class="bas indent1"><span class="nm">(c)</span><span class="cl">Support:</span> Presumably this is correct, for Shmuel said that the Halachah follows R. Eliezer regarding Chalah:</p>
<p class="bas indent2"><span class="nm">1.</span><span class="cl">(Mishnah - R. Eliezer):</span> Even if one removed loaves from the oven and put them in a basket, they join (for the Shi'ur of one and a quarter Kavim of flour) to obligate separating Chalah.</p>
<p class="bas indent1"><span class="nm">(d)</span><span class="cl">Question:</span> Why is Chalah a better proof than Mi'un?</p>
<p class="bas indent1"><span class="nm">(e)</span><span class="cl">Answer #1:</span> We could have said that the Halachah follows R. Eliezer regarding Mi'un because (the Tana) R. <i>Elazar</i> agrees with R. Eliezer.</p>
<p class="bas indent2"><span class="nm">1.</span><span class="cl">(Mishnah - R. Elazar):</span> We instruct Rachel to do Mi'un (in a case very similar to R. Eliezer's case).</p>
<p class="bas indent1"><span class="nm">(f)</span><span class="cl">Rejection:</span> Shmuel had to teach that the Halachah follows R. Eliezer and that it follows R. Elazar, for we cannot learn from one to the other!</p>
<p class="bas indent1"><span class="nm">(g)</span><span class="cl">Answer #2:</span> We could have said that the Halachah follows R. Eliezer regarding Mi'un because R. Yehudah ben Bava agrees with him;</p>
<p class="bas indent2"><span class="nm">1.</span><span class="cl">(Mishnah):</span> R. Yehudah ben Bava testified about five laws for which he had a tradition:</p>
<p class="bas indent3"><span class="nm">i.</span>We instruct girls to do Mi'un;</p>
<p class="bas indent3"><span class="nm">ii.</span>A woman can remarry based on one witness who says that her husband died;</p>
<p class="bas indent3"><span class="nm">iii.</span>A chicken was stoned in Yerushalayim because it killed a person;</p>
<p class="bas indent3"><span class="nm">iv.</span>Wine may be used for Nesachim 40 days after the grapes were pressed;</p>
<p class="bas indent3"><span class="nm">v.</span>The morning Tamid may be offered until (the end of) the fourth hour of the day.</p>
<p class="bas indent2"><span class="nm">2.</span><span class="cl">Suggestion:</span> 'We instruct <i>girls</i> to do Mi'un' refers to two cases, of R. Eliezer and R. Elazar.</p>
<p class="bas indent2"><span class="nm">3.</span><span class="cl">Objection:</span> Perhaps it refers only to the case of R. Elazar. He said <i>girls</i> (plural) because the law applies to all girls in that situation!</p>
<p class="bas indent2"><span class="nm">4.</span><span class="cl">Rejection (and culmination of support):</span> If so, the next law should also use the plural, and say <i>women</i> may remarry... !</p>
<p class="bas subject"><span class="nm">2)</span>R. ELAZAR'S OPINION</p>
<p class="bas indent1"><span class="nm">(a)</span><span class="cl">(R. Elazar):</span> The Halachah follows R. Eliezer in four places (those that Shmuel taught).</p>
<p class="bas indent1"><span class="nm">(b)</span><span class="cl">Question (Mishnah - R. Eliezer):</span> We instruct Rachel to do Mi'un.</p>
<p class="bas indent2"><span class="nm">1.</span><span class="cl">(R. Elazar (the Amora)):</span> The Halachah follows R. Eliezer.</p>
<p class="bas indent2"><span class="nm">2.</span><span class="cl">Suggestion:</span> Perhaps R. Elazar meant (like Shmuel) that the Halachah follows R. Eliezer only in four places in Seder Taharos.</p>
<p class="bas indent2"><span class="nm">3.</span><span class="cl">Rejection (Mishnah #1):</span> Shemitah and Bi'ur apply to the following and anything exchanged for them -- roses, henna (used to make dye), letom (an extract of chestnut or pine) and Ketaf (sap of balsam, a barren tree).</p>
<p class="bas indent3"><span class="nm">i.</span><span class="cl">(R. Pedas, the son of R. Elazar):</span> The Mishnah is like R. Eliezer, who considers sap like fruit.</p>
<p class="bas indent3"><span class="nm">ii.</span><span class="cl">(R. Zeira):</span> Beware! Between the teachings of you and your father, you permit Ketaf! (However, the Halachah is that Shemitah applies to Ketaf.)</p>
<p class="bas indent3"><span class="nm">iii.</span>You say that only R. Eliezer, not Chachamim, considers sap like fruit, and your father says that the Halachah follows R. Eliezer in only four places!</p>
<p class="bas indent2"><span class="nm">4.</span>If R. Elazar referred only to places in Seder Taharos, R. Pedas should have said so to R. Zeira!</p>
<p class="bas indent1"><span class="nm">(c)</span><span class="cl">Answer #1:</span> Mi'un does not contradict R. Elazar's rule, because (the Tana) R. Elazar agrees with R. Eliezer.</p>
<p class="bas indent2"><span class="nm">1.</span><span class="cl">(Mishnah - R. Elazar):</span> We instruct Rachel to do Mi'un..</p>
<p class="bas indent1"><span class="nm">(d)</span><span class="cl">Rejection:</span> R. Eliezer and R. Elazar discussed different cases. We cannot learn from one to the other!</p>
<p class="bas indent1"><span class="nm">(e)</span><span class="cl">Answer #2:</span> Mi'un does not contradict R. Elazar's rule, because R. Yehudah ben Bava agrees with him.</p>
<p class="bas indent1"><span class="nm">(f)</span><span class="cl">Question (Mishnah - R. Akiva):</span> (On Motzei Shabbos) we say Havdalah (in Shmoneh Esreh) as the fourth blessing by itself;</p>
<p class="bas indent2"><span class="nm">1.</span>R. Eliezer says, we include it in (the blessing) Modim.</p>
<p class="bas indent2"><span class="nm">2.</span><span class="cl">(R. Elazar):</span> The Halachah follows R. Eliezer.</p>
<p class="bas indent1"><span class="nm">(g)</span><span class="cl">Answer (R. Aba):</span> This does not contradict R. Elazar's rule, because R. Eliezer did not teach that Halachah himself. He merely cited R. Chanina ben Gamliel's opinion;</p>
<p class="bas indent2"><span class="nm">1.</span><span class="cl">(Beraisa - R. Akiva):</span> Havdalah itself is the fourth blessing;</p>
<p class="bas indent2"><span class="nm">2.</span>R. Chanina ben Gamliel says, we include it in Modim.</p>
<p class="bas bbbline">8b----------------------------------------8b</p>
<p class="bas indent1"><span class="nm">(h)</span><span class="cl">Rejection:</span> It is unreasonable to say that R. Eliezer cites R. Chanina ben Gamliel. R. Eliezer was much older than he!</p>
<p class="bas indent1"><span class="nm">(i)</span><span class="cl">Correction:</span> Rather, this does not contradict R. Elazar's rule, because R. Chanina ben Gamliel agrees with him.</p>
<p class="bas indent1"><span class="nm">(j)</span><span class="cl">Question:</span> R. Chanina ben Gamliel does not hold like R. Eliezer!</p>
<p class="bas indent2"><span class="nm">1.</span><span class="cl">(Beraisa):</span> On Yom Kipur night, there are seven Berachos in the Amidah, and we say Viduy (confession). The same applies to Shacharis, Musaf, Minchah and Ne'ilah;</p>
<p class="bas indent2"><span class="nm">2.</span>On Motz'ei Yom Kipur, one may say seven Berachos that encompass the 18 (the fourth blessing "Havinenu" encompasses the usual 12 middle Berachos);</p>
<p class="bas indent2"><span class="nm">3.</span>R. Chanina ben Gamliel says, in his fathers' name, that one must say all 18 Berachos, in order to say Havdalah in (the blessing) Chonen Da'as.</p>
<p class="bas indent1"><span class="nm">(k)</span><span class="cl">Answer (Rav Nachman bar Yitzchak):</span> R. Chanina ben Gamliel himself holds like R. Eliezer. In the Beraisa he merely cites his father's opinion.</p>
<p class="bas indent1"><span class="nm">(l)</span><span class="cl">Question (R. Yirmeyah, of R. Zeira):</span> How can you disagree with R. Pedas (who established Mishnah #1, which considers sap like fruit, to be R. Eliezer)?!</p>
<p class="bas indent2"><span class="nm">1.</span><span class="cl">(Mishnah #2 - R. Eliezer):</span> If sap of Orlah is used to curdle, it (the cheese) is forbidden. (This shows that R. Eliezer considers sap like fruit!)</p>
<p class="bas indent1"><span class="nm">(m)</span><span class="cl">Answer #1 (R. Zeira):</span> Chachamim argue only about sap of the trunk. They agree that sap of fruit (unripe figs) is considered fruit.</p>
<p class="bas indent2"><span class="nm">1.</span><span class="cl">(Mishnah - R. Yehoshua):</span> I heard that if sap of leaves or roots was used to curdle, it is permitted. If sap of unripe figs was used, this is like fruit, and it is forbidden.</p>
<p class="bas indent1"><span class="nm">(n)</span><span class="cl">Answer #2:</span> Chachamim argue with R. Eliezer only about fruit trees. They agree that sap of a barren tree is its fruit.</p>
<p class="bas indent2"><span class="nm">1.</span><span class="cl">(Mishnah - R. Shimon):</span> Shemitah does not apply to Ketaf;</p>
<p class="bas indent2"><span class="nm">2.</span>Chachamim say, Shemitah applies to Ketaf. The sap is its fruit.</p>
<p class="bas indent2"><span class="nm">3.</span><span class="cl">Suggestion:</span> The Chachamim of this Mishnah are the same Chachamim who argue with R. Eliezer!</p>
<p class="bas indent1"><span class="nm">(o)</span><span class="cl">Rejection (an elder citing R. Yochanan):</span> No, these Chachamim are R. Eliezer, who says that sap is the fruit.</p>
<p class="bas indent1"><span class="nm">(p)</span><span class="cl">Question:</span> If so, why does he discuss sap of a barren tree? He considers even sap of fruit trees to be fruit!</p>
<p class="bas indent1"><span class="nm">(q)</span><span class="cl">Answer:</span> He addresses Chachamim (R. Shimon) according to their reasoning:</p>
<p class="bas indent2"><span class="nm">1.</span>I consider even sap of fruit trees to be fruit. Granted, you do not, but you should agree that sap of barren trees is considered fruit!</p>
<p class="bas indent2"><span class="nm">2.</span>Chachamim do not distinguish.</p>
<p class="bas subject"><span class="nm">3)</span>THE <i>BESULAH</i> OF THE MISHNAH</p>
<p class="bas indent1"><span class="nm">(a)</span><span class="cl">(Mishnah):</span> A Besulah is a girl who has never seen blood...</p>
<p class="bas indent1"><span class="nm">(b)</span><span class="cl">(Beraisa #1):</span> If she was married and saw Dam Besulim, or if she saw blood due to giving birth (but never saw Dam Nidah) she is still a Besulah;</p>
<p class="bas indent1"><span class="nm">(c)</span>Besulah (for this Halachah) refers to Besulas Damim (she never saw Dam Nidah), but not one who still has Besulim (tokens of virginity).</p>
<p class="bas indent1"><span class="nm">(d)</span><span class="cl">Question (Beraisa #2, explained by Rav Kahana):</span> There are three kinds of Besulos -- a human Besulah, Besulah land, and a Besulah sycamore tree;</p>
<p class="bas indent2"><span class="nm">1.</span>A girl is a Besulah until she has relations. This is relevant to marrying a Kohen Gadol, and her Kesuvah. (A Besulah gets 200. A non-Besulah gets 100);</p>
<p class="bas indent2"><span class="nm">2.</span>Land is Besulah until it is worked. This is relevant to Eglah Arufah (it may be beheaded there), and a sale (if the seller claimed that it is Besulah);</p>
<p class="bas indent2"><span class="nm">3.</span>A sycamore is Besulah until it is pruned. This is relevant to a sale, and to Shemitah;</p>
<p class="bas indent3"><span class="nm">i.</span><span class="cl">(Mishnah):</span> One may not prune a Besulah sycamore tree in Shemitah, for this is considered work (that improves it).</p>
<p class="bas indent2"><span class="nm">4.</span>According to Beraisa #1, there is a fourth Besulah, a Besulas Damim!</p>
<p class="bas indent1"><span class="nm">(e)</span><span class="cl">Answer #1 (Rav Nachman bar Yitzchak):</span> The Beraisa (#2) does not list Besulos with an accompanying name. (Besulas Damim is not called (just) "Besulah".)</p>
<p class="bas indent1"><span class="nm">(f)</span><span class="cl">Answer #2 (Rav Sheshes brei d'Rav Idi):</span> The Beraisa lists only Besulos that cease to be Besulos through an action. (A girl ceases to be a Besulas Damim automatically, when she becomes Nidah);</p>
<p class="bas indent1"><span class="nm">(g)</span><span class="cl">Answer #3 (R. Chanina brei d'Rav Ika):</span> The Beraisa lists only Besulos that (once they cease to be Besulos) never revert to their original law. (A Besulas Damim will again be Dayah Sha'atah when she is old.)</p>
<p class="bas indent1"><span class="nm">(h)</span><span class="cl">Answer #4 (Ravina):</span> The Beraisa lists only Besulos that buyers (or men marrying women) care about, but a man does not care whether or not his wife is Besulas Damim.</p>
<p class="bas indent1"><span class="nm">(i)</span><span class="cl">Objection (Beraisa - R. Chiya):</span> Just like Se'or (sourdough) is good for (fermenting) a dough, blood is good for a woman;</p>
<p class="bas indent2"><span class="nm">1.</span><span class="cl">(Beraisa - R. Meir):</span> If a woman has much blood, it is a sign that she will have many children.</p>
<p class="bas indent1"><span class="nm">(j)</span><span class="cl">Correction:</span> Ravina meant that the Beraisa lists only Besulos that people desire, but men shun Besulas Damim.</p>
<p class="bas indent1"><span class="nm">(k)</span><span class="cl">(Beraisa):</span> If pebbles (or clumps of earth) come up when plowing (the earth does not crumble), the land is Besulah;</p>
<p class="bas indent2"><span class="nm">1.</span>If shards of earthenware are found, it is not Besulah. If there is a big rock, it is Besulah.</p>
<p class="bas subject"><span class="nm">4)</span>WHEN IS A PREGNANT WOMAN <i>DAYAH SHA'ATAH</i>?</p>
<p class="bas indent1"><span class="nm">(a)</span><span class="cl">(Mishnah):</span> A pregnant woman is Dayah Sha'atah from the time the fetus shows.</p>
<p class="bas indent1"><span class="nm">(b)</span><span class="cl">Question:</span> When is it considered that the fetus shows?</p>
<p class="bas indent1"><span class="nm">(c)</span><span class="cl">Answer (Sumchus):</span> This is after three months. There is a hint, but not a proof - "va'Yehi kemi'Shelosh Chadashim" (people saw that Tamar was pregnant).</p>
<p class="bas indent1"><span class="nm">(d)</span><span class="cl">Question:</span> That is a fine proof!</p>
<p class="bas indent1"><span class="nm">(e)</span><span class="cl">Answer:</span> Some women give birth after nine months, and others after seven months. (The fetus always shows after a third of the pregnancy. From the verse, one might have thought that if the fetus shows after two and a third months, she is Dayah Sha'atah.)</p>
<p class="bas indent1"><span class="nm">(f)</span><span class="cl">(Beraisa):</span> If a woman was assumed to be pregnant and saw blood, and miscarried a Ru'ach (nothing came out) or a nonviable fetus, she is Dayah Sha'atah. (The miscarriage does not prove that she was not considered pregnant);</p>
<p class="bas indent2"><span class="nm">1.</span>There is a hint, but not a proof -- "Harinu Chalnu Kemo Yaladnu Ru'ach." (It is called pregnancy, even though it resulted in giving birth to a Ru'ach!)</p>
<p class="bas indent1"><span class="nm">(g)</span><span class="cl">Question:</span> That is a fine proof!</p>
<p class="bas indent1"><span class="nm">(h)</span><span class="cl">Answer:</span> The verse discusses men comparing themselves to pregnant women. (Perhaps the metaphor is not totally accurate.)</p>
