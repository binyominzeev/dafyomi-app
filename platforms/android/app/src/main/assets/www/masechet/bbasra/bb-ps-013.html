<p class="bas subject"><span class="nm">1)</span>DIVIDING A FIELD THAT BORDERS WATER</p>
<p class="bas indent1"><span class="nm">(a)</span><span class="cl">Version #1 (Rashi):</span> If there is a river on one side of a field, and an irrigation channel on an adjacent side, we divide the field (like illustrated in Rashi. Each brother gets four shares. The distance of each brother's land from the river and irrigation channel is the same.)</p>
<p class="bas indent1"><span class="nm">(b)</span><span class="cl">Version #2 (Tosfos):</span> If there is a river on two adjacent sides of a field, and an irrigation channel on the other two sides, we divide the field along the diagonal. (Each brother gets a field with one side on the river, and one side on the irrigation channel.)</p>
<p class="bas subject"><span class="nm">2)</span>GUD O AGUD</p>
<p class="bas indent1"><span class="nm">(a)</span><span class="cl">(Mishnah):</span> We do not divide a salon...</p>
<p class="bas indent1"><span class="nm">(b)</span><span class="cl">Question:</span> If there is not enough for each partner to get a proper share, what is the law?</p>
<p class="bas indent1"><span class="nm">(c)</span><span class="cl">Answer #1 (Rav Yehudah):</span> The law of 'Gud O Agud' applies (a partner can set a price, and say 'buy my share for this price, or I will buy your share for this price').</p>
<p class="bas indent1"><span class="nm">(d)</span><span class="cl">Answer #2 (Rav Nachman):</span> 'Gud O Agud' does not apply.</p>
<p class="bas indent1"><span class="nm">(e)</span><span class="cl">Question (against Rav Nachman - Rava):</span> If 'Gud O Agud' does not apply, if a firstborn and his brother inherit a slave or a Tamei animal, what is the law?</p>
<p class="bas indent1"><span class="nm">(f)</span><span class="cl">Answer (Rav Nachman):</span> The slave alternates. He serves the firstborn for two days, and his brother for one day.</p>
<p class="bas indent1"><span class="nm">(g)</span><span class="cl">Question (against Rav Yehudah - Mishnah - Beis Hillel):</span> A half-slave alternates. He serves his master for one day, and himself for one day;</p>
<p class="bas indent2"><span class="nm">1.</span><span class="cl">Beis Shamai:</span> That is good for the master, but not for the slave. He cannot marry!</p>
<p class="bas indent2"><span class="nm">2.</span>He cannot marry a slave (since he is half-free). He cannot marry a Bas Yisrael (since he is a half-slave).</p>
<p class="bas indent2"><span class="nm">3.</span><span class="cl">Suggestion:</span> Perhaps he will not marry!</p>
<p class="bas indent2"><span class="nm">4.</span><span class="cl">Rejection:</span> The world was created for the sake of reproduction - "Lasheves Yetzarah"!</p>
<p class="bas indent2"><span class="nm">5.</span>Rather, we force the master to free the slave. The slave writes a document obligating himself to pay the master half of his value.</p>
<p class="bas indent2"><span class="nm">6.</span>Beis Hillel retracted, and agreed with Beis Shamai. (This was only to enable the slave to marry. Otherwise, the slave cannot force the master to set a price for the slave half to redeem himself!)</p>
<p class="bas indent1"><span class="nm">(h)</span><span class="cl">Answer:</span> A half slave is different. The owner cannot buy (the free half, for a half slave cannot become a full slave), therefore Gud O Agud does not apply</p>
<p class="bas indent1"><span class="nm">(i)</span><span class="cl">Question (against Rav Yehudah - Mishnah):</span> If Reuven is rich, and his brother Shimon is poor, and they inherited a bathhouse and an olivepress;</p>
<p class="bas indent2"><span class="nm">1.</span>If normally they are rented out, they share the revenue;</p>
<p class="bas indent2"><span class="nm">2.</span>If the father made them for his own use, Reuven can tell Shimon 'also we will also use them ourselves. Go buy slaves to heat it up, and go buy olives and press them!' (Shimon cannot. Reuven will use it himself; Shimon cannot tell Reuven to buy his share!)</p>
<p class="bas bbbline">13b----------------------------------------13b</p>
<p class="bas indent1"><span class="nm">(j)</span><span class="cl">Answer:</span> Also there, Gud O Agud does not apply because Shimon cannot (afford to) buy Reuven's share.</p>
<p class="bas indent1"><span class="nm">(k)</span><span class="cl">Question (against Rav Nachman - Mishnah):</span> The general rule is, we divide only if each will get a portion that keeps the original name. If not, we estimate its value (and Gud O Agud applies).</p>
<p class="bas indent1"><span class="nm">(l)</span><span class="cl">Answer:</span> Tana'im argue about whether or not we apply Gud O Agud.</p>
<p class="bas indent2"><span class="nm">1.</span><span class="cl">(Beraisa):</span> Levi may say 'take a proper share (that keeps its name), and I will take (the rest, even though it is) less than this;</p>
<p class="bas indent2"><span class="nm">2.</span>R. Shimon ben Gamliel says, Yehudah can protest.</p>
<p class="bas indent2"><span class="nm">3.</span><span class="cl">Question:</span> What is the case?</p>
<p class="bas indent3"><span class="nm">i.</span>If we understand the Beraisa like it is taught, what is R. Shimon's reason?!</p>
<p class="bas indent2"><span class="nm">4.</span><span class="cl">Answer #1:</span> Rather, the Beraisa is abbreviated. It means as follows: Levi may say 'take a proper share, and I will take less.' Also, Levi can say 'Gud O Agud';</p>
<p class="bas indent2"><span class="nm">5.</span>R. Shimon ben Gamliel says, he cannot say 'Gud O Agud.'</p>
<p class="bas indent1"><span class="nm">(m)</span><span class="cl">Rejection (and Answer #2 to Question 3):</span> Really, the Beraisa means exactly like it says;</p>
<p class="bas indent2"><span class="nm">1.</span>R. Shimon ben Gamliel says that Yehudah can protest 'I do not have the money to compensate you for the larger portion, nor do I want to take it as a gift - "v'Sonei Matanos Yichyeh"!'</p>
<p class="bas indent1"><span class="nm">(n)</span><span class="cl">Abaye:</span> Rav Yehudah holds like Shmuel!</p>
<p class="bas indent2"><span class="nm">1.</span><span class="cl">(Mishnah):</span> Regarding Seforim, even if both want to divide, they may not.</p>
<p class="bas indent2"><span class="nm">2.</span><span class="cl">(Shmuel):</span> This is only if the Seforim are bound together. If each is bound by itself, they divide.</p>
<p class="bas indent3"><span class="nm">i.</span>If the law of Gud O Agud did not apply, even if they were not bound together, either could stop the other from dividing!</p>
<p class="bas indent1"><span class="nm">(o)</span><span class="cl">Rejection (Rav Salman):</span> Shmuel teaches that the Mishnah forbids dividing Seforim wrapped together even if both want to divide. (He did not address whether or not Gud O Agud applies when only one wants to divide.)</p>
<p class="bas indent1"><span class="nm">(p)</span><span class="cl">(Ameimar):</span> The Halachah is, we say Gud O Agud.</p>
<p class="bas indent2"><span class="nm">1.</span><span class="cl">Rav Ashi:</span> Rav Nachman argues!</p>
<p class="bas indent2"><span class="nm">2.</span><span class="cl">Ameimar:</span> I argue with Rav Nachman.</p>
<p class="bas indent2"><span class="nm">3.</span><span class="cl">Question:</span> Chinena left two slaves to his two sons. One knew how to cook, and the other knew to sew and weave. (One son told his brother "take one, and I will take the other.") Rava ruled that the law of Gud O Agud does not apply.</p>
<p class="bas indent2"><span class="nm">4.</span><span class="cl">Answer:</span> (Normally, Rava rules like Gud O Agud.) That case is different, because each of them needs both slaves. Saying 'take one' is not Gud O Agud. (Gud O Agud is to offer to buy the other's share in both, or sell his own share in both.)</p>
<p class="bas indent2"><span class="nm">5.</span><span class="cl">Question:</span> Regarding Seforim, both need both, yet Shmuel taught that if each Sefer is bound by itself, they divide!</p>
<p class="bas indent2"><span class="nm">6.</span><span class="cl">Answer:</span> Rav Salman said that this is when both want to divide. (The question of Gud O Agud is when only one wants to divide.)</p>
<p class="bas subject"><span class="nm">3)</span>BINDING SEFORIM</p>
<p class="bas indent1"><span class="nm">(a)</span><span class="cl">(Beraisa - R. Meir):</span> One may bind Torah, the Nevi'im and Kesuvim together;</p>
<p class="bas indent1"><span class="nm">(b)</span>R. Yehudah says, we bind Torah by itself, Nevi'im by themselves and Kesuvim by themselves.</p>
<p class="bas indent1"><span class="nm">(c)</span>Chachamim say, each Sefer of the Nevi'im and Kesuvim is bound by itself.</p>
<p class="bas indent1"><span class="nm">(d)</span><span class="cl">(Rav Yehudah):</span> R. Elazar ben Azaryah authorized Baisus ben Zunin to bind the eight Seforim of the Nevi'im together (the 12 minor Nevi'im count like one Sefer);</p>
<p class="bas indent2"><span class="nm">1.</span>Some say that each was bound by itself.</p>
<p class="bas indent1"><span class="nm">(e)</span><span class="cl">Rebbi:</span> Torah, Nevi'im and Kesuvim bound together were once brought in front of us, and we approved.</p>
<p class="bas indent1"><span class="nm">(f)</span>Four blank lines separate between the Seforim of Torah, and also between different Nevi'im;</p>
<p class="bas indent2"><span class="nm">1.</span>Three lines separate between the 12 minor Nevi'im.</p>
<p class="bas indent2"><span class="nm">2.</span>If one Navi finishes at the bottom of a column, one may start the next at the top of the next column without leaving blank lines.</p>
<p class="bas indent1"><span class="nm">(g)</span><span class="cl">(Beraisa):</span> One may write Torah, Nevi'im and Kesuvim on the same parchment;</p>
<p class="bas indent2"><span class="nm">1.</span>He leaves enough (blank parchment) at the beginning to wrap around a pole, and enough at the end to surround (the Sefer).</p>
<p class="bas indent2"><span class="nm">2.</span>He ends one Sefer at the bottom and begins the next at the top. If he wants to cut them, he may.</p>
<p class="bas indent2"><span class="nm">3.</span><span class="cl">Question:</span> What does this mean? (Surely, it is better if they are separate!)</p>
<p class="bas indent2"><span class="nm">4.</span><span class="cl">Answer:</span> It is advisable to end each Sefer at the bottom and to begin the next at the top, so he will be able to cut them.</p>
