<div class="indent1"><span class="nm">(a)</span><p><span class="cl">Version #1 - Rashi - (Beraisa - R. Meir):</span> If an Am ha'Aretz (or Kohen or Levi) originally did not accept a matter of Chaverus (or Leviyah or Kehunah, and now he agrees to accept everything), we never accept him;</p></div>
<div class="indent1"><span class="nm">(b)</span><p><span class="cl">Version #1A:</span> R. Yehudah says, if he impoved his ways only in private, we do not accept him. If he repented (even) in public, we accept him;</p></div>
<div class="indent1"><span class="nm">(c)</span><p><span class="cl">Version #1B (of R. Yehudah):</span> If he sinned in private (he did not descecrate Hash-m's name), we accept him. If he sinned openly, we do not accept them.</p></div>
<div class="indent1"><span class="nm">(d)</span><p><span class="cl">Version #2 - Tosfos - (Beraisa - R. Meir):</span> If an Am ha'Aretz (or convert, Kohen or Levi) accepted Chaverus (or the Mitzvos, Leviyah or Kehunah, and did not fulfill it), and seeks to repent, we never accept (trust) him;</p></div>
<div class="indent1"><span class="nm">(e)</span><p><span class="cl">Version #2A:</span> R. Yehudah says if (only) in private he returned to his sinful way, we do not accept him (for he is a deceiver). If he openly stumbled, we accept him;</p></div>
<div class="indent1"><span class="nm">(f)</span><p><span class="cl">Version #2B:</span> If we saw him fulfill his acceptance in private (before he sinned), we accept him. If we saw him fulfill it (only) in public, we do not accept him. (end of Version #2)</p></div>
<div class="indent1"><span class="nm">(g)</span><p>R. Shimon and R. Yehoshua ben Korchah say in either case we accept him - "Shuvu Banim Shovevim."</p></div>
<div class="indent1"><span class="nm">(h)</span><p><span class="cl">(R. Yitzchak of Ako):</span> The Halachah follows R. Shimon and R. Yehoshua.</p></div>
<div class="indent1"><span class="nm">(i)</span><p><span class="cl">(Beraisa):</span> Initially, if a Chaver became a tax collector, he ceased to be considered a Chaver. Even if he ceased to be a tax collector, he would not be accepted for Chaverus;</p></div>
<div class="indent2"><span class="nm">1.</span><p>They retracted to say that if he ceased, he is like anyone else. (He can accept Chaverus.)</p></div>
<div class="indent1"><span class="nm">(j)</span><p>Chachamim needed to ask questions of Rav Huna bar Chiya (Rashi; R. Gershom - he fell sick; Maharsha - he needed money, so he became a tax collector). Rabah, Rav Yosef and 400 pairs of Chachamim were heading towards him; he prepared to receive them. They heard that he became a tax collector, and sent to him "you chose what you want. We will not come to you." He promised to quit his job.</p></div>
<div class="indent1"><span class="nm">(k)</span><p>Rav Yosef did not go to him, for the Beraisa says that even if he ceases, he is not accepted;</p></div>
<div class="indent1"><span class="nm">(l)</span><p>Rabah went to him, for Chachamim retracted to say that if he ceases, he is like anyone else.</p></div>
<div class="subject"><span class="nm">2)</span><p>RULING ABOUT ONE'S OWN PROPERTY</p></div>
<div class="indent1"><span class="nm">(a)</span><p><span class="cl">(Beraisa):</span> One may inspect (a Mum on) any Bechor, except for his own;</p></div>
<div class="indent1"><span class="nm">(b)</span><p>He may inspect (even) his own Kodshim (except for Bechor) or Ma'aser (Behemah), and rule about his own Taharos.</p></div>
<div class="indent1"><span class="nm">(c)</span><p><span class="cl">Question:</span> In what case may one inspect any Bechor except for his own?</p></div>
<div class="indent2"><span class="nm">1.</span><p>One person may not check by himself. Three are needed!</p></div>
<div class="indent1"><span class="nm">(d)</span><p><span class="cl">Answer #1:</span> He is one of three that check.</p></div>
<div class="indent1"><span class="nm">(e)</span><p><span class="cl">Rejection:</span> If so, he would not be suspected! (He may be one of those who check his own animal.)</p></div>
<div class="indent2"><span class="nm">1.</span><p><span class="cl">(Mishnah):</span> If Leah did Mi'un or Chalitzah in front of Reuven, he may marry her, because this requires a Beis Din. (We do not suspect the other judges!)</p></div>
<div class="indent1"><span class="nm">(f)</span><p><span class="cl">Answer #2:</span> Really, he checks by himself, like Rav Chisda taught (elsewhere) that an expert is like three (regarding permitting vows);</p></div>
<div class="indent2"><span class="nm">1.</span><p>Here also, one expert may check a Mum.</p></div>
<div class="indent1"><span class="nm">(g)</span><p>He may inspect his own Kodshim (other than Bechor). He is not suspected, for he could retract his Hekdesh (like Hataras Nedarim) if he wanted;</p></div>
<div class="indent1"><span class="nm">(h)</span><p>He may inspect his own Ma'aser. He is not suspected, for he could have put Mumim in his entire herd before taking Ma'aser. (This is permitted, for they were Chulin at the time.)</p></div>
<div class="indent1"><span class="nm">(i)</span><p>He may rule about his own (Chulin) Taharos. He is not suspected, for even if they are Teme'im, he could eat them when he is Tamei.</p></div>
<div class="perekline">PEREK KOL PESULEI HA'MUKDASHIM</div>
<div class="subject"><span class="nm">3)</span><p>SELLING PESULEI HA'MUKDASHIM</p></div>
<div class="indent1"><span class="nm">(a)</span><p><span class="cl">(Mishnah):</span> All Pesulei ha'Mukdashim may be slaughtered and sold in the Itliz (meat market), and weighed b'Litra\ (in units of even though this is a disgrace to Hekdesh), except for Bechor and Ma'aser, for the Hana'ah (benefit, i.e. money received for them) belongs to the owner;</p></div>
<div class="indent2"><span class="nm">1.</span><p>The Hana'ah of (other) Kodshim is Hekdesh. (It is used to buy a similar Korban.)</p></div>
<div class="indent1"><span class="nm">(b)</span><p>One may weigh meat of Bechor against meat (Rambam - of Bechor, to equate the portions; Rashi - of Chulin, of a known weight).</p></div>
<div class="bbbline">31b----------------------------------------31b</p></div>
<div class="indent1"><span class="nm">(c)</span><p><span class="cl">(Gemara) Question:</span> What is the case (in which Hana'ah of Kodshim is Hekdesh)?</p></div>
<div class="indent2"><span class="nm">1.</span><p>It is not after redemption. Money received after Pidyon belongs to the owner!</p></div>
<div class="indent1"><span class="nm">(d)</span><p><span class="cl">Answer #1:</span> It must be before Pidyon.</p></div>
<div class="indent1"><span class="nm">(e)</span><p><span class="cl">Question:</span> If they are slaughtered, Pidyon will be impossible, for Ha'amadah and Ha'arachah (standing it up before a Kohen for appraisal) must be done first!</p></div>
<div class="indent2"><span class="nm">1.</span><p>There is no question according to the opinion that Ha'amadah and Ha'arachah do not apply to Kodshei Mizbe'ach. We ask only according to the opinion that they do apply.</p></div>
<div class="indent1"><span class="nm">(f)</span><p><span class="cl">Answer #2:</span> Really, it is after Pidyon;</p></div>
<div class="indent2"><span class="nm">1.</span><p>When appraising them, the Kohen knows that they may be slaughtered and sold in the Itliz and weighed normally, so he sets a higher redemption price. This is Hana'ah for Hekdesh.</p></div>
<div class="indent1"><span class="nm">(g)</span><p><span class="cl">(Mishnah):</span> Except for Bechor and Ma'aser, for the Hana'ah belongs to the owner.</p></div>
<div class="indent1"><span class="nm">(h)</span><p><span class="cl">Question:</span> Granted, one may not sell Bechor in the Itliz, but one may sell it in his house;</p></div>
<div class="indent2"><span class="nm">1.</span><p>However, it is misleading to say that Ma'aser may not be sold in the Itliz. It may not be sold anywhere!</p></div>
<div class="indent3"><span class="nm">i.</span><p><span class="cl">(Beraisa):</span> It says about Bechor "Lo Sifdeh." It may be sold (even) while alive;</p></div>
<div class="indent3"><span class="nm">ii.</span><p>It says about Ma'aser "Lo Yiga'el," it may not be sold alive or slaughtered, Tam or Ba'al Mum.</p></div>
<div class="indent1"><span class="nm">(i)</span><p><span class="cl">Answer (Rav Sheshes, based on a Beraisa):</span> The Mishnah alludes to Ma'aser Behemah of orphans. It may be sold (privately in the house) to avoid a loss.</p></div>
<div class="indent1"><span class="nm">(j)</span><p>His servant, Rav Idi, said this in the Beis Medrash, without citing Rav Sheshes; when Rav Sheshes found out, he was upset.</p></div>
<div class="indent1"><span class="nm">(k)</span><p><span class="cl">Rav Sheshes:</span> One who stings should be stung by a scorpion (i.e. excommunicated)!</p></div>
<div class="indent1"><span class="nm">(l)</span><p><span class="cl">Question:</span> Why was Rav Sheshes upset?</p></div>
<div class="indent1"><span class="nm">(m)</span><p><span class="cl">Answer - Question (Rav Yehudah):</span> How do we understand "Agurah b'Ohalcha <i>Olamim</i>"? Can one live in two worlds?</p></div>
<div class="indent2"><span class="nm">1.</span><p><span class="cl">Answer (Rav Yehudah):</span> David requested that teachings be said in his name in this world (after his death);</p></div>
<div class="indent2"><span class="nm">2.</span><p><span class="cl">(R. Yochanan):</span> If a teaching is said in the name of a deceased Chacham, his lips move (Tosfos Yeshanim - drip) in the grave.</p></div>
<div class="indent2"><span class="nm">3.</span><p><span class="cl">(R. Yitzchak bar Ze'iri):</span> He learns from "v'Chikech k'Yein ha'Tov... Dovev Sifsei Yeshenim";</p></div>
<div class="indent2"><span class="nm">4.</span><p>His lips are like a bucket of grapes. If they are touched, they move (Tosfos Yeshanim - they exude juice).</p></div>
<div class="subject"><span class="nm">4)</span><p>THE HETER TO SELL MA'ASAR BEHEMAH</p></div>
<div class="indent1"><span class="nm">(a)</span><p><span class="cl">Question:</span> Which Beraisa did Rav Sheshes learn from?</p></div>
<div class="indent1"><span class="nm">(b)</span><p><span class="cl">Answer (Beraisa):</span> Ma'aser Behemah of orphans may be sold;</p></div>
<div class="indent2"><span class="nm">1.</span><p>(The meat of) a slaughtered Ma'aser Behemah may be sold b'Havla'ah (together, for one price) with the skin, Chelev, Gidim and horns. (He sells these for an inflated price, and gives the meat for free with them.)</p></div>
<div class="indent1"><span class="nm">(c)</span><p><span class="cl">Question:</span> What does this mean? (First it says that Ma'aser may be sold (normally), then it says that it may be sold only b'Havla'ah!)</p></div>
<div class="indent1"><span class="nm">(d)</span><p><span class="cl">Answer #1 (Abaye):</span> A (slaughtered) Ma'aser Behemah of orphans may be sold b'Havla'ah.</p></div>
<div class="indent2"><span class="nm">1.</span><p><span class="cl">Inference:</span> Ma'aser Behemah of adults may not be sold (even) b'Havla'ah.</p></div>
<div class="indent2"><span class="nm">2.</span><p><span class="cl">Question:</span> Why is this different than an Esrog of Shemitah, which may be sold b'Havla'ah?</p></div>
<div class="indent3"><span class="nm">i.</span><p><span class="cl">(Mishnah):</span> When one buys a Lulav from an Am ha'Aretz in Shemitah, the seller gives an Esrog for a gift, for one may not buy it. (We do not pay an Am ha'Aretz for Shemitah produce, lest he not treat the money with Kedushas Shemitah. One may buy the Lulav, for it is inedible, so it and the money paid for it have no Kedushah.)</p></div>
<div class="indent3"><span class="nm">ii.</span><p><span class="cl">Question:</span> What can one do if the seller does not agree to give it for a gift?</p></div>
<div class="indent3"><span class="nm">iii.</span><p><span class="cl">Answer (Rav Huna):</span> One buys it b'Havla'ah with the Lulav.</p></div>
<div class="indent2"><span class="nm">3.</span><p><span class="cl">Answer:</span> Regarding an Esrog, the ruse is not evident, for the price charged for the Lulav is reasonable (Esrogim are relatively cheap);</p></div>
<div class="indent3"><span class="nm">i.</span><p>Regarding Ma'aser, the ruse is evident, for the meat is worth much more than the skin (and Chelev, etc.) No one would pay so much for skin alone.</p></div>
<div class="indent1"><span class="nm">(e)</span><p><span class="cl">Objection (Rava):</span> If the Beraisa were all one clause, it would not say "Ma'aser Behemah"... and then repeat "Ma'aser Behemah"!</p></div>
<div class="indent1"><span class="nm">(f)</span><p><span class="cl">Answer #2 (Rava):</span> It means that Ma'aser Behemah of orphans may be sold normally;</p></div>
<div class="indent2"><span class="nm">1.</span><p>A slaughtered Ma'aser of an adult may be sold b'Havla'ah with the skin, etc... .</p></div>
<div class="indent1"><span class="nm">(g)</span><p><span class="cl">(Rava):</span> I learn from "(v'Lo Yemirenu... v'Im Hamer Yemirenu) v'Hayah Hu u'Semuraso Yihyeh Kodesh Lo Yiga'el" - just like Temurah applies while it is alive, also the Isur to sell it;</p></div>
<div class="indent2"><span class="nm">1.</span><p>Chachamim decreed against selling it after Shechitah, lest one sell it before Shechitah;</p></div>
<div class="indent2"><span class="nm">2.</span><p>They decreed only about what is (important and) commonly sold in the animal's lifetime (i.e. meat);</p></div>
<div class="indent2"><span class="nm">3.</span><p>Chachamim did not decree concerning orphans.</p></div>
