<p class="dedicationbox">ERCHIN 6-9 - Two weeks of study material have been dedicated by Mrs. Estanne Abraham Fawer to honor the twelfth Yahrzeit of her father, Rav Mordechai ben Eliezer Zvi (Rabbi Morton Weiner) Z'L, who passed away on 18 Teves 5760. May the merit of supporting and advancing Dafyomi study -- which was so important to him -- during the weeks of his Yahrzeit serve as an Iluy for his Neshamah. </p>

<p class="bas indent1"><span class="nm">(a)</span><span class="cl">(Beraisa #1):</span> If a Nochri donates to Bedek ha'Bayis, we accept from him.</p>
<p class="bas indent1"><span class="nm">(b)</span><span class="cl">Contradiction (Beraisa #2):</span> We do not accept from him.</p>
<p class="bas indent1"><span class="nm">(c)</span><span class="cl">Resolution (Rav Ila):</span> Ba'Techilah, we do not accept. Ba'Sof, we accept. (Rashi - during the building, we do not accept, lest this cause slackening (Tosfos - lest he retract). After it is built, to support it, we accept. Rambam - l'Chatchilah we do not accept. If we already accepted from him, we do not return it. R. Gershom - if a Nochri offers to give, we tell him that we will not accept. If he brought a gift, we accept it.)</p>
<p class="bas indent2"><span class="nm">1.</span><span class="cl">(Rav Asi):</span> Ba'Techilah we do not accept even water or salt. Ba'Sof, we accept from him, but not something specific. (It will be recognizable, and this is a disgrace. Alternatively, the Nochri will aggrandize himself that he donated it.)</p>
<p class="bas indent2"><span class="nm">2.</span><span class="cl">(Rav Yosef):</span> An example of something specific is Kalyah Orev. (It prevents ravens from perching on the Heichal. Rashi - these are spikes, or an iron plate with a sharp edge pointing up. Aruch - it is a scarecrow).</p>
<p class="bas indent1"><span class="nm">(d)</span><span class="cl">Question (Rav Yosef):</span> It says "v'Igeres El Asaf Shomer ha'Pardes Asher la'Melech"! (Rashi - they accepted from Koresh ba'Techilah for Bayis Sheni. Tosfos - it was decreed (Yeshayah 45:13) that the king will build Bayis Sheni. Rav Yosef asks why they accepted from Asaf.)</p>
<p class="bas indent1"><span class="nm">(e)</span><span class="cl">Answer (Abaye):</span> The king is different. He does not retract;</p>
<p class="bas indent2"><span class="nm">1.</span><span class="cl">(Shmuel):</span> If the king says that he will uproot a mountain, he will do so, he will not retract.</p>
<p class="bas subject"><span class="nm">2)</span>TERUMAH OF NOCHRIM</p>
<p class="bas indent1"><span class="nm">(a)</span><span class="cl">(Rav Yehudah):</span> If a Nochri separated Terumah from his grain, we ask him his intent:</p>
<p class="bas indent2"><span class="nm">1.</span>If he separated b'Da'as Yisrael (to be like Terumah that Yisraelim separate. Alternatively, upon a Yisrael's request), it is given to a Kohen;</p>
<p class="bas indent2"><span class="nm">2.</span>If not, it requires Genizah (burial), lest he was Makdish it.</p>
<p class="bas indent1"><span class="nm">(b)</span><span class="cl">Question (Beraisa):</span> If a Nochri donated a beam (for a Beis ha'Keneses) with Hash-m's Name on it, we ask him his intent:</p>
<p class="bas indent2"><span class="nm">1.</span>If he donated b'Da'as Yisrael, we cut off the place where Hash-m's Name is. The Name requires Genizah, and the beam may be used;</p>
<p class="bas indent2"><span class="nm">2.</span>If not, it requires Genizah, lest he was Makdish it.</p>
<p class="bas indent2"><span class="nm">3.</span><span class="cl">Inference:</span> If the beam did not have Hash-m's Name on it, we would not be concerned, and it would not require Genizah!</p>
<p class="bas indent1"><span class="nm">(c)</span><span class="cl">Answer:</span> No, even without Hash-m's Name it requires Genizah (unless he says that he donated b'Da'as Yisrael);</p>
<p class="bas indent2"><span class="nm">1.</span>The Beraisa teaches that even with Hash-m's name, after cutting off the Name the rest may be used. His Name forbids only the place it is written on. (Alternatively, it forbids only when it is part of a verse written on paper.)</p>
<p class="bas indent2"><span class="nm">2.</span><span class="cl">(Beraisa):</span> If Hash-m's Name was written on the handle of a Kli or on the legs of a bed, we cut off the Name and we bury it (the rest may be used).</p>
<p class="bas subject"><span class="nm">3)</span>CHANGING <i>TZEDAKAH</i></p>
<p class="bas indent1"><span class="nm">(a)</span><span class="cl">Version #1 (Rav Nachman):</span> If one said "this coin is for Tzedakah", it is permitted to change it (Rambam - replace it with a different coin; Rashi - borrow it and repay it later).</p>
<p class="bas indent1"><span class="nm">(b)</span><span class="cl">Assumption:</span> One may change it himself. He may not change it with (Rambam - the coin of; Rashi - he may not lend it to) someone else.</p>
<p class="bas indent1"><span class="nm">(c)</span><span class="cl">(R. Ami):</span> He may change (borrow) it himself, or with (lend it to) another person.</p>
<p class="bas indent1"><span class="nm">(d)</span><span class="cl">(R. Ze'ira):</span> This is only if he said "Alai". If he said "this", the very coin must be given to Tzedakah.</p>
<p class="bas indent1"><span class="nm">(e)</span><span class="cl">Objection (Rava):</span> Just the contrary! If he said "this," we want (and therefore allow) him to change (borrow) it, so he will have Acharayus (liability to replace it if it gets lost);</p>
<p class="bas indent2"><span class="nm">1.</span>If he said "Alai", he already has Acharayus, so we need not allow him to change it!</p>
<p class="bas indent1"><span class="nm">(f)</span>Rather, in either case he may change it.</p>
<p class="bas indent1"><span class="nm">(g)</span><span class="cl">Support (for Rava - Beraisa):</span> Neder is Tzedakah. Hekdesh is not Tzedakah.</p>
<p class="bas indent2"><span class="nm">1.</span><span class="cl">Objection:</span> This cannot be! Neither Neder nor Hekdesh is Tzedakah!</p>
<p class="bas indent2"><span class="nm">2.</span><span class="cl">Correction:</span> It means, one can transgress Bal Te'acher for (a Neder to give) Tzedakah, but Tzedakah is unlike a Korban, for one may use Tzedakah, but not Hekdesh.</p>
<p class="bas indent1"><span class="nm">(h)</span><span class="cl">Version #2 - Rav Zevid of Neharda'a - (Rav Nachman):</span> If one said "this coin is for Tzedakah," it is permitted to change it;</p>
<p class="bas indent2"><span class="nm">1.</span>Either he or someone else may change it, whether he said "Alai" or "this." (end of Version #2)</p>
<p class="bas indent1"><span class="nm">(i)</span><span class="cl">(Beraisa):</span> If one said "this coin is for Tzedakah," it is permitted to change it before the Gabai (overseer of Tzedakah) received it, but not afterwards.</p>
<p class="bas bbbline">6b----------------------------------------6b</p>
<p class="bas indent1"><span class="nm">(j)</span><span class="cl">Question:</span> R. Yanai was a Gabai, and he used to borrow Tzedakah and repay!</p>
<p class="bas indent1"><span class="nm">(k)</span><span class="cl">Answer:</span> That benefited the poor. He did so in order to persuade people to give more Tzedakah. (It enabled him to tell them that there is no Tzedakah money to give to the poor)!</p>
<p class="bas indent1"><span class="nm">(l)</span><span class="cl">(Beraisa):</span> If a Yisrael donated a candelabra or lamp to a Beis ha'Keneses, one may not change it (for a different purpose, or to sell it).</p>
<p class="bas indent1"><span class="nm">(m)</span><span class="cl">Assumption (R. Chiya bar Aba):</span> It is forbidden even for the sake of a Mitzvah.</p>
<p class="bas indent1"><span class="nm">(n)</span><span class="cl">R. Ami:</span> R. Yochanan permits changing it only for the sake of a Mitzvah, but not for Reshus. We learn this from R. Asi:</p>
<p class="bas indent2"><span class="nm">1.</span><span class="cl">(R. Asi citing R. Yochanan):</span> If a Nochri donated a candelabra or lamp to a Beis ha'Keneses, one may not change it as long as people mention the donor (for the Nochri will scream if it is changed). Afterwards, it is permitted.</p>
<p class="bas indent2"><span class="nm">2.</span><span class="cl">Question:</span> To what change (i.e. for what purpose) does he refer?</p>
<p class="bas indent3"><span class="nm">i.</span>It cannot be for Reshus. This is forbidden even if a Yisrael donated it! (We do not descend in Kedushah)! Rosh (Bava Basra 1:29) - once it is forgotten who gave it, it may be changed even to Reshus. People donate based on the will of the Tzibur.)</p>
<p class="bas indent2"><span class="nm">3.</span><span class="cl">Answer:</span> He refers to changing for the sake of a Mitzvah;</p>
<p class="bas indent3"><span class="nm">i.</span>This is forbidden regarding a Nochri donor, who would scream. It is permitted if a Yisrael donated it.</p>
<p class="bas indent1"><span class="nm">(o)</span>Shazrak (a Nochri merchant) donated a lamp to Rav Yehudah's Beis ha'Keneses. Rachbah changed it, and Rava was upset. (Some say vice-versa. Some say that the city leaders changed it, and Rachbah and Rava were upset.)</p>
<p class="bas indent2"><span class="nm">1.</span>The one who changed it reasoned that it is permitted, for Shazrak is not often in the city, so we are not concerned lest he scream;</p>
<p class="bas indent2"><span class="nm">2.</span>The other opinion objected, lest Shazrak come on occasion.</p>
<p class="bas subject"><span class="nm">4)</span><i>ERCHIN</i> OF A PERSON ABOUT TO DIE</p>
<p class="bas indent1"><span class="nm">(a)</span><span class="cl">(Mishnah):</span> A Goses or one being led to his execution (via Beis Din of Yisrael) cannot be Nidar or Ne'erach;</p>
<p class="bas indent1"><span class="nm">(b)</span>R. Chanina ben Akavya says, he can be Ne'erach, because Erchin are fixed. (They do not depend on (slave market) value);</p>
<p class="bas indent1"><span class="nm">(c)</span>R. Yosi says, he can be Noder, Ma'arich and Makdish. If he damaged, he is liable.</p>
<p class="bas indent1"><span class="nm">(d)</span><span class="cl">(Gemara) Question:</span> We understand why a Goses cannot be Nidar. He has no Damim (value). He cannot be Ne'erach, for Ha'amadah and Ha'arachah cannot be done;</p>
<p class="bas indent2"><span class="nm">1.</span>We understand why one about to be executed cannot be Nidar, for he has no Damim.</p>
<p class="bas indent2"><span class="nm">2.</span>However, but why can't he be Ne'erach?</p>
<p class="bas indent1"><span class="nm">(e)</span><span class="cl">Answer	(Beraisa) Question:</span> What is the source that if someone about to be executed said "Erki Alai," his words do not take effect?</p>
<p class="bas indent2"><span class="nm">1.</span><span class="cl">Answer:</span> "Kol Cherem... Lo Yipadeh."</p>
<p class="bas indent2"><span class="nm">2.</span><span class="cl">Suggestion:</span> Perhaps this applies even before the final verdict!</p>
<p class="bas indent2"><span class="nm">3.</span><span class="cl">Rejection:</span> "Min ha'Adam" - not every person (that might be killed) is excluded.</p>
<p class="bas indent1"><span class="nm">(f)</span><span class="cl">Question:</span> R. Chanina ben Akavya says that he can be Ne'erach. How does he expound "Kol Cherem... Lo Yipadeh"?</p>
<p class="bas indent1"><span class="nm">(g)</span><span class="cl">Answer (Beraisa - R. Yishmael, son of R. Yochanan ben Brokah):</span> We find that people who are Chayav Misah b'Yedei Shamayim get atonement through money - "Im Kofer Yushas Alav."</p>
<p class="bas indent2"><span class="nm">1.</span><span class="cl">Suggestion:</span> Perhaps this applies even to one who is Chayav Misah b'Yedei Adam!</p>
<p class="bas indent2"><span class="nm">2.</span><span class="cl">Rejection:</span> "Kol Cherem... Lo Yipadeh."</p>
<p class="bas indent2"><span class="nm">3.</span><span class="cl">Suggestion:</span> Perhaps this applies only to "severe" capital transgressions, but not for "light" ones, i.e. for which the Torah gives an atonement if done b'Shogeg! (I.e. a Shogeg murderer is exiled to a refuge city, and one who transgressed Chayavei Kerisus brings a Korban Chatas.)</p>
<p class="bas indent2"><span class="nm">4.</span><span class="cl">Rejection:</span> "<i>Kol</i> Cherem" teaches that it applies to all.</p>

<p class="bas indent1"><span class="nm">(a)</span><span class="cl">(Mishnah - R. Yosi):</span> He can be Noder, Ma'arich... .</p>
<p class="bas indent1"><span class="nm">(b)</span><span class="cl">Question:</span> The first Tana agrees with this!</p>
<p class="bas indent1"><span class="nm">(c)</span><span class="cl">Answer:</span> Indeed, all agree that he can be Noder, Ma'arich and Makdish. They argue only about damage:</p>
<p class="bas indent2"><span class="nm">1.</span>The first Tana exempts for damage. R. Yosi obligates.</p>
<p class="bas indent1"><span class="nm">(d)</span><span class="cl">Version #1 - Question:</span> What do they argue about?</p>
<p class="bas indent1"><span class="nm">(e)</span><span class="cl">Answer #1 (Rav Yosef):</span> They argue about whether a Milveh Al Peh (a loan without a document) can be collected from heirs. The first Tana says that it cannot, and R. Yosi says that it can. (We are thinking that the obligation to pay for damage is like a Milveh Al Peh, because there is no document.)</p>
<p class="bas indent1"><span class="nm">(f)</span><span class="cl">Objection (Rava):</span> All agree that a Milveh Al Peh cannot be collected from heirs!</p>
<p class="bas indent1"><span class="nm">(g)</span><span class="cl">Answer #2 (Rava):</span> Rather, they argue about whether or not Milveh ha'Kesuvah b'Torah (an obligation explicitly written in the Torah) is considered like a Milveh bi'Shtar (with a document). The first Tana says that it is not (hence the heirs are exempt), and R. Yosi says that it is. (In Version #2, the Amora'im argue about a Beraisa.)</p>
<p class="bas indent1"><span class="nm">(h)</span><span class="cl">Version #2 - (Beraisa):</span> If Reuven was being led to his execution and he damaged, he is liable. If others damaged him, they are exempt;</p>
<p class="bas indent1"><span class="nm">(i)</span>R. Shimon ben Elazar says, also he is exempt if he damaged. We do not return him to Beis Din to judge his obligation to pay, for this is Inuy (delay of execution).</p>
