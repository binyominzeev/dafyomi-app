<p class="bas subject"><span class="nm">1)</span>THE <i>TOSEFTA</i> ABOUT CALCULATING <i>ORLAH </i>(cont.)</p>
<p class="bas indent1"><span class="nm">(a)</span><span class="cl">Question:</span> How do we know that the years of Orlah and Revai extend to fruit that grows between Rosh Hashanah and Tu B'Shevat-the fifiteenth of Shevat?</p>
<p class="bas indent1"><span class="nm">(b)</span><span class="cl">Answer:</span> (R. Chiya bar Aba citing R. Yochanan/ citing R. Yanai):</p>
<p class="bas indent2"><span class="nm">1.</span>The Torah says (Vayikra 19,23-24) "(It is Orlah) and in the fourth year (it is Revai)" - the prefix "and" implies that the prohibition of Orlah can extend into part of the fourth year.</p>
<p class="bas indent2"><span class="nm">2.</span>Likewise, the Torah says (Vayikra 19,24-25) "(It is Revai) and in the fifth year (it is totally permitted)" - the prefix "and" implies that the laws of Revai can extend into part of the fifth year.</p>
<p class="bas subject"><span class="nm">2)</span>WHOSE OPINION  DOES THE <i>TOSEFTA </i>FOLLOW?</p>
<p class="bas indent1"><span class="nm">(a)</span><span class="cl">Question:</span> It seems that this Tosefta (which holds that less than thirty days does not count as a year) does not follow R. Meir, who says that one day of a year counts as a year, as taught in a Beraisa:</p>
<p class="bas indent2"><span class="nm">1.</span>(R. Meir) When the Torah speaks of a "Par", it refers to an animal at least twenty-four months and one day old.</p>
<p class="bas indent2"><span class="nm">2.</span>(R. Elazar) It refers to an animal at least twenty-four months and thirty days old.</p>
<p class="bas indent2"><span class="nm">3.</span>R. Meir's opinion is based on his view that "Eigel" refers to a cow in its first year, "Ben Bakar" refers to a cow in its second year, and "Par" refers to an animal in its third year</p>
<p class="bas indent1"><span class="nm">(b)</span><span class="cl">Answer:</span> It could even follow R. Meir; he only holds that one day counts as a year when it is at the end of the time period, not when it is at the beginning.</p>
<p class="bas indent2"><span class="nm">1.</span><span class="cl">Question (Rava):</span> Surely it is a Kal v'Chomer that a day should be counted as a year at the beginning:</p>
<p class="bas indent3"><span class="nm">i.</span>In the case of a Nidah, the seventh day of the time period must be a complete day, but the first day can be even the final part of the day alone.</p>
<p class="bas indent3"><span class="nm">ii.</span>Therefore in the case of years, if one day counts as a year at the end of the time period, all the more so should it count as a year at the beginning of the time period!</p>
<p class="bas bbbline">10b----------------------------------------10b</p>
<p class="bas indent1"><span class="nm">(c)</span><span class="cl">Question:</span> Is the Tosefta following the opinion of R. Elazar? According to him, it would have to be planted sixty days before Rosh Hashanah to be counted as a year, as is seen in the following Mishnah;</p>
<p class="bas indent2"><span class="nm">1.</span>(R. Elazar) One may not plant, bend the runner of a plant into the earth to take root, or graft, within thirty days of the Shemitah year; if one did so, it must be uprooted.</p>
<p class="bas indent2"><span class="nm">2.</span>(R. Yehudah) One may do this until three days before the Shmittah year.</p>
<p class="bas indent2"><span class="nm">3.</span>(R. Yosi and R. Shimon) One may do this until two weeks before the Shemitah year.</p>
<p class="bas indent2"><span class="nm">4.</span><span class="cl">Gemara:</span> (R. Nachman, citing Rabah bar Avuha) Thirty days must be added to all these opinions to give time for the plant to take root.</p>
<p class="bas indent1"><span class="nm">(d)</span><span class="cl">Question:</span> If you say the Tosefta follows R. Yehudah, it should say thirty-three days before Rosh Hashanah!?</p>
<p class="bas indent1"><span class="nm">(e)</span><span class="cl">Answer:</span> The Tosefta follows R. Meir; it required a minimum of thirty days because that is the time needed so that the tree can take root.</p>
<p class="bas indent2"><span class="nm">1.</span><span class="cl">Question:</span> If so, it should have said thirty-one days (an additional day to count as the first year)!?</p>
<p class="bas indent2"><span class="nm">2.</span><span class="cl">Answer:</span> He holds that the thirtieth day counts for both the tree taking root and for the first year.</p>
<p class="bas subject"><span class="nm">3)</span>COUNTING DAYS OR MONTHS AS YEARS</p>
<p class="bas indent1"><span class="nm">(a)</span>(R. Yochanan) Both R. Meir and R. Elazar derive their positions from the same Pasuk: (Beraishis 8,13), "In the first-and-six-hundredth year, on the first of the first month."</p>
<p class="bas indent2"><span class="nm">1.</span>(R. Meir) Since it was only one day into the year, and it calls it the 601st year, we see that one day counts as a year.</p>
<p class="bas indent2"><span class="nm">2.</span>R. Elazar will respond that the word "year" is going on the six hundred, not on the  one.</p>
<p class="bas indent2"><span class="nm">3.</span>(R. Elazar) Since it was only one day into the month, and the Torah calls it a month, we see that one day counts as a month; and if one unit of a month counts as a month, then one unit of a year (i.e. a month) counts as a year.</p>

<p class="bas indent2"><span class="nm">2.</span>On Rosh Hashanah, Sarah, Rachel and Chanah were designated to give birth, Yosef was released from prison, and the slavery in Egypt ceased.</p>
