<div class="subject"><span class="nm">1)</span><p>WHICH KODSHIM MAY BE REDEEMED?</p></div>
<div class="indent1"><span class="nm">(a)</span><p><span class="cl">Question:</span> Where is a Ba'al Mum called 'Tamei'?</p></div>
<div class="indent1"><span class="nm">(b)</span><p><span class="cl">Answer (Beraisa):</span> "V'Im Kol Behemah Temei'ah Asher Lo Yakrivu Mimenu Korban la'Shem" refers to a Ba'al Mum that was redeemed.</p></div>
<div class="indent2"><span class="nm">1.</span><p><span class="cl">Suggestion:</span> Perhaps it truly refers to a Tamei (species of) Behemah!</p></div>
<div class="indent2"><span class="nm">2.</span><p><span class="cl">Rejection:</span> "V'Im ba'Behemah ha'Temei'ah u'Fadah v'Erkecha" discusses a Tamei Behemah. "V'Im Kol Behemah Temei'ah " must refer to a Ba'al Mum that was redeemed.</p></div>
<div class="indent1"><span class="nm">(c)</span><p><span class="cl">Suggestion:</span> Perhaps a Zevach may be redeemed if it has a Mum Over (temporary Mum)!</p></div>
<div class="indent1"><span class="nm">(d)</span><p><span class="cl">Rejection:</span> "Asher Lo Yakrivu Mimenu Korban la'Shem" refers to something that can never be offered. This excludes a Ba'al Mum Over, for it may be offered later.</p></div>
<div class="indent1"><span class="nm">(e)</span><p><span class="cl">Question (against Shmuel - Rav Huna bar Mano'ach - Mishnah):</span> Birds, wood, Levonah and Klei Shares cannot be redeemed ((even) after becoming Tamei), for redemption applies only to animals.</p></div>
<div class="indent2"><span class="nm">1.</span><p><span class="cl">Question:</span> Granted, birds have Kedushas ha'Guf, so they may not be redeemed. However, one should be able to redeem wood, Levonah and Klei Shares! (They themselves are not offered. They are merely Hechsher Avodah!)</p></div>
<div class="indent2"><span class="nm">2.</span><p><span class="cl">Answer:</span> We must say that they cannot be redeemed because (generally) Tahor Kodshim cannot be redeemed, and these are considered Tehorim even when they are (seemingly) Teme'im:</p></div>
<div class="indent3"><span class="nm">i.</span><p>Wood and Levonah are not foods. They are Tamei only due to Chibas ha'Kodesh (a stringency of Kodshim). Before the wood is trimmed to be fit for logs, and before the Levonah is Hukdash in a Kli, they are not Mekabel Tum'ah;</p></div>
<div class="indent3"><span class="nm">ii.</span><p>Even a Tamei Kli is considered Tahor, because it can be immersed. (We do not make Klei Shares from earthenware, which cannot be immersed.)</p></div>
<div class="indent1"><span class="nm">(f)</span><p><span class="cl">Answer:</span> Really, normally, Tahor Kodshim can be redeemed. Wood, Levonah and Klei Shares are exceptions. Because they are scarce, Chachamim decreed not to redeem them when they are Tehorim.</p></div>
<div class="indent1"><span class="nm">(g)</span><p><span class="cl">Question:</span> Granted, Levonah and Klei Shares are scarce. However, wood is readily available!</p></div>
<div class="indent1"><span class="nm">(h)</span><p><span class="cl">Answer:</span> A Mishnah teaches that if a worm is found in a log, it is Pasul for the Ma'arachah. Therefore, Kosher wood is rare.</p></div>
<div class="indent1"><span class="nm">(i)</span><p><span class="cl">(Rav Papa):</span> Had Shmuel heard the following Beraisa, he would have retracted (for it refutes him)!</p></div>
<div class="indent2"><span class="nm">1.</span><p><span class="cl">(Beraisa):</span> If one is Matfis Temimim (Makdish unblemished animals) to Bedek ha'Bayis, they are redeemed only in order to offer them;</p></div>
<div class="indent2"><span class="nm">2.</span><p>Anything (Hukdash and) Kosher for the Mizbe'ach must be offered, it can never be redeemed.</p></div>
<div class="indent2"><span class="nm">3.</span><p><span class="cl">Conclusion:</span> Even though it is only Kedushas Damim, it cannot be redeemed because it is  Tahor!</p></div>
<div class="indent1"><span class="nm">(j)</span><p><span class="cl">Rejection:</span> Shmuel would not retract due to the Beraisa;</p></div>
<div class="indent2"><span class="nm">1.</span><p>We said that Chachamim decreed not to redeem scarce things that are Tehorim. Also unblemished Behemos are rare, for even a film in the eye is a Mum!</p></div>
<div class="indent1"><span class="nm">(k)</span><p><span class="cl">(Rav Kahana):</span> All Menachos can be redeemed if they are Teme'im, but not if they are Tehorim.</p></div>
<div class="indent1"><span class="nm">(l)</span><p><span class="cl">Version #1:</span> R. Oshaya agrees with Rav Kahana.</p></div>
<div class="indent1"><span class="nm">(m)</span><p><span class="cl">Version #2 - (R. Oshaya):</span> They can be redeemed even if they are Tehorim.</p></div>
<div class="indent1"><span class="nm">(n)</span><p><span class="cl">Version #1 - Rashi - (R. Elazar):</span> All can be redeemed only if they are Teme'im, except for Minchas Chotei. "Me'Chataso" and "Al Chataso" teach that it may be redeemed when Tahor. (The verses discuss Oleh v'Yored (a rich person brings a Seh Chatas, and an Oni brings birds or flour.) "Me'Chataso" teaches that if a rich person was Makdish money for a Seh, and then became poor, he may use some of it to buy birds, and the rest is Chulin. "Al Chataso" teaches that if an Oni was Makdish money for birds, and then became rich, he may add money to it to buy a Seh.)</p></div>
<div class="indent1"><span class="nm">(o)</span><p><span class="cl">Version #2 - R. Gershom - (R. Elazar):</span> All can be redeemed if and only if they are Teme'im, except for Minchas Chotei. It says "Al Chataso" instead of "me'Chataso", to teach that its law is like Chatas (Behemah), which may not be redeemed even if it is a Ba'al Mum (which is called 'Tamei').</p></div>
<div class="subject"><span class="nm">2)</span><p>TUM'AS OCHLIM OF ISUREI HANA'AH</p></div>
<div class="indent1"><span class="nm">(a)</span><p><span class="cl">(R. Oshaya citing R. Shimon):</span> If one was Mefagel a Minchah, it does not receive Tum'as Ochlim.</p></div>
<div class="indent2"><span class="nm">1.</span><p><span class="cl">(Beraisa):</span> The following receive Tum'as Ochlim, even though they are Isurei Hana'ah (one may not benefit from them):</p></div>
<div class="bbbline">101b----------------------------------------101b</p></div>
<div class="indent3"><span class="nm">i.</span><p>Orlah (fruits of a tree within its first three years), Kilai ha'Kerem (crossbreeds with grapes), Shor ha'Niskal (an ox sentenced to be stoned), Eglah Arufah (a calf beheaded for atonement when a murdered corpse is found), Tziporei Metzora (birds that permit him to enter the city), a firstborn donkey, and meat and milk.</p></div>
<div class="indent3"><span class="nm">ii.</span><p>R. Shimon says, they do not receive Tum'as Ochlim.</p></div>
<div class="indent2"><span class="nm">2.</span><p>R. Shimon agrees that meat and milk is Tamei (receives Tum'as Ochlim), for it had She'as ha'Kosher (it was once permitted to Yisrael, i.e. the moment they were mixed together, before they absorbed from each other).</p></div>
<div class="indent2"><span class="nm">3.</span><p><span class="cl">(Rav Asi):</span> R. Shimon learns from "mi'Kol ha'Ochel Asher Ye'achel" that something is considered food (regarding Tum'as Ochlim) if and only if one may feed it to others (Nochrim. I.e., one may benefit from it, even if a Yisrael may not eat it.)</p></div>
<div class="indent2"><span class="nm">4.</span><p><span class="cl">Conclusion:</span> A Pigul Minchah is Isurei Hana'ah, so one may not feed it to others. Therefore it is not Tamei.</p></div>
<div class="indent1"><span class="nm">(b)</span><p><span class="cl">Question:</span> Why does R. Shimon say that meat and milk is Tamei for it had She'as ha'Kosher? It suffices that (he holds that) one may feed it to others!</p></div>
<div class="indent2"><span class="nm">1.</span><p><span class="cl">(Beraisa - R. Shimon ben Yehudah citing R. Shimon):</span> One may not eat meat and milk. One may benefit from it. It says "Ki Am Kodesh Atah... Lo Sevashel Gedi ba'Chalev Imo", similar to "v'Anshei Kodesh Tihyun Li u'Vasar ba'Sadeh Treifah Lo Sochelu";</p></div>
<div class="indent2"><span class="nm">2.</span><p>Just like one may benefit from a Treifah but not eat it, the same applies to meat and milk.</p></div>
<div class="indent1"><span class="nm">(c)</span><p><span class="cl">Answer:</span> R. Shimon gives a second reason why meat and milk is Tamei;</p></div>
<div class="indent2"><span class="nm">1.</span><p>Firstly, it is Tamei because one may feed it to others;</p></div>
<div class="indent2"><span class="nm">2.</span><p>Secondly, it is Tamei because it was once permitted to Yisrael.</p></div>
<div class="indent1"><span class="nm">(d)</span><p><span class="cl">Question (Beraisa - R. Shimon):</span> Sometimes, Nosar receives Tum'as Ochlim. Sometimes it does not:</p></div>
<div class="indent2"><span class="nm">1.</span><p>If the time to eat it passed and Zerikah was not done, it is Tahor. If Zerikah was done in the proper time, it is Tamei.</p></div>
<div class="indent2"><span class="nm">2.</span><p>Pigul, whether of Kodshei ha'Kodoshim or Kodshei Kalim, is Tahor.</p></div>
<div class="indent2"><span class="nm">3.</span><p>A Pigul Minchah is Tamei.</p></div>
<div class="indent1"><span class="nm">(e)</span><p><span class="cl">Answer:</span> The Beraisa discusses a Pigul Minchah that had She'as ha'Kosher. R. Oshaya discusses one that was never permitted.</p></div>
<div class="indent1"><span class="nm">(f)</span><p><span class="cl">Question:</span> What is the case of a Minchah that was never permitted? (Surely, before it was Hukdash it was permitted!)</p></div>
<div class="indent1"><span class="nm">(g)</span><p><span class="cl">Answer:</span> Attached wheat was Hukdash for the Minchah. (It was forbidden the entire time it had potential to receive Tum'as Ochlim, i.e. from when it was detached.)</p></div>
<div class="subject"><span class="nm">3)</span><p>POTENTIAL SHE'AS HA'KOSHER</p></div>
<div class="indent1"><span class="nm">(a)</span><p><span class="cl">Question:</span> It could have been redeemed before it was put in a Kli Shares! (It is as if it had She'as ha'Kosher!)</p></div>
<div class="indent1"><span class="nm">(b)</span><p><span class="cl">Answer - part 1:</span> According to Version #1 (Amud A), R. Oshaya says that Tehorim may not be redeemed (therefore, there was no She'as ha'Kosher);</p></div>
<div class="indent2"><span class="nm">1.</span><p>However, according to Version #2, he says that even Tehorim may be redeemed. If so, there was She'as ha'Kosher!</p></div>
<div class="indent1"><span class="nm">(c)</span><p><span class="cl">Answer - part 2:</span> Since they were not redeemed, it is considered that there was not She'as ha'Kosher.</p></div>
<div class="indent1"><span class="nm">(d)</span><p><span class="cl">Question:</span> R. Shimon holds that anything ready to be redeemed is considered as if it was redeemed!</p></div>
<div class="indent2"><span class="nm">1.</span><p><span class="cl">(Beraisa - R. Shimon):</span> Parah Adumah receives Tum'as Ochlim because there was a time when it could potentially be eaten.</p></div>
<div class="indent2"><span class="nm">2.</span><p><span class="cl">(Reish Lakish):</span> R. Shimon holds that it may be redeemed even (after Shechitah) at the woodpile (when it is about to be burned).</p></div>
<div class="indent1"><span class="nm">(e)</span><p><span class="cl">Answer:</span> He considers only Parah as if it was redeemed, for sometimes it is a Mitzvah to redeem it, e.g. if a nicer Parah was found;</p></div>
<div class="indent2"><span class="nm">1.</span><p>It is never a Mitzvah to redeem Menachos. (They are brought only from choice flour and oil.)</p></div>
<div class="indent1"><span class="nm">(f)</span><p><span class="cl">Question:</span> It is a Mitzvah to do Zerikah, yet the Beraisa teaches that if a Korban was Lan (left overnight) without Zerikah, it is not Tamei. (We do not consider it as if Zerikah was done!)</p></div>
<div class="indent1"><span class="nm">(g)</span><p><span class="cl">Answer #1:</span> The case is, it was slaughtered so close to the end of the day that there was no time to do Zerikah. (Another answer will be given later.)</p></div>
<div class="indent1"><span class="nm">(h)</span><p><span class="cl">Inference:</span> If it was slaughtered earlier, and there was time to do Zerikah, Lan without Zerikah is Tamei.</p></div>
<div class="indent1"><span class="nm">(i)</span><p><span class="cl">Question:</span> If so, the Beraisa should have distinguished between more similar cases!</p></div>
<div class="indent2"><span class="nm">1.</span><p>It should say that if a Korban was slaughtered without time left in the day to do Zerikah, it is Tahor. If time remained for Zerikah, it is Tamei (and all the more so, if Zerikah was done)!</p></div>
<div class="indent1"><span class="nm">(j)</span><p><span class="cl">Answer:</span> Indeed, this is what the Beraisa means! If it was Lan and there was never time to do Zerikah, it is Tahor. If it was Lan and there was time for Zerikah, it is Tamei.</p></div>
