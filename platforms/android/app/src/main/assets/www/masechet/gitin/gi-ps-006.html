<p class="bas subject"><span class="nm">1)</span>WHAT MUST THE <i>SHALI'ACH</i> SEE?</p>
<p class="bas indent1"><span class="nm">(a)</span><span class="cl">Support (for Rav Ashi - Beraisa):</span> If Get brought from abroad is Kosher even if the Shali'ach was in the house, and the scribe was in the second story, or vice-versa, and even if he went in and out all day.</p>
<p class="bas indent2"><span class="nm">1.</span><span class="cl">Question:</span> If he was in the house and the scribe was in the second story, he did not see it written!</p>
<p class="bas indent2"><span class="nm">2.</span><span class="cl">Answer:</span> We must say that he heard the scratching of the quill on the parchment.</p>
<p class="bas indent1"><span class="nm">(b)</span><span class="cl">Question:</span> The Beraisa says 'even if he went in and out all day.' To whom does this refer?</p>
<p class="bas indent2"><span class="nm">1.</span><span class="cl">Suggestion:</span> It refers to the Shali'ach.</p>
<p class="bas indent2"><span class="nm">2.</span><span class="cl">Rejection:</span> It is Kosher even if he was in the house and the scribe was in the second story, and he did not see the writing. All the more so, it is Kosher if he went in and out!</p>
<p class="bas indent1"><span class="nm">(c)</span><span class="cl">Answer:</span> Rather, it refers to the scribe.</p>
<p class="bas indent1"><span class="nm">(d)</span><span class="cl">Question:</span> This is obvious! Should the Get be Pasul because the scribe left the house?!</p>
<p class="bas indent1"><span class="nm">(e)</span><span class="cl">Answer:</span> The case is, he went to the market. One might have thought that we should be concerned lest another man asked the scribe to write the Get for him (and the scribe had this in mind). The Beraisa teaches that we are not concerned for this.</p>
<p class="bas subject"><span class="nm">2)</span>THE STATUS OF BAVEL</p>
<p class="bas indent1"><span class="nm">(a)</span><span class="cl">(Rav):</span> The law of Bavel is like Eretz Yisrael regarding Gitin.</p>
<p class="bas indent1"><span class="nm">(b)</span><span class="cl">(Shmuel):</span> Bavel is like Chutz La'aretz regarding Gitin.</p>
<p class="bas indent1"><span class="nm">(c)</span><span class="cl">Suggestion:</span> Rav holds that the declaration is because we are concerned lest it was not Lishmah, and people in Bavel are learned. Shmuel holds that the declaration is for Kiyum, and witnesses from Bavel are not common.</p>
<p class="bas indent1"><span class="nm">(d)</span><span class="cl">Objection:</span> Even Rabah, who is concerned for Lishmah, is also concerned for Kiyum!</p>
<p class="bas indent1"><span class="nm">(e)</span><span class="cl">Correction:</span> Rather, both agree that we are concerned for Kiyum;</p>
<p class="bas indent2"><span class="nm">1.</span>Rav holds that since there are Yeshivos in Bavel (and people often travel between them), witnesses are commonly found. Shmuel holds that Talmidim learning in Yeshivah are too busy to become familiar with signatures.</p>
<p class="bas indent1"><span class="nm">(f)</span><span class="cl">(R. Aba):</span> After Rav came to Bavel (and established a Yeshiva), Bavel became like Eretz Yisrael regarding Gitin.</p>
<p class="bas indent1"><span class="nm">(g)</span><span class="cl">Question (R. Yirmeyah - Mishnah):</span> R. Yehudah obligates a Get brought from Rekem or eastwards. Rekem itself is considered Chutz La'aretz. From Ashkelon or further south is like Chutz La'aretz. From Ako or further north is like Chutz La'aretz.</p>
<p class="bas indent2"><span class="nm">1.</span>Bavel is north of Ako - "the evil will sprout from the north"!</p>
<p class="bas indent2"><span class="nm">2.</span>R. Meir says, Ako is like Eretz Yisrael regarding Gitin.</p>
<p class="bas indent3"><span class="nm">i.</span><span class="cl">Summation of question:</span> Even R. Meir says so only about Ako, since it is near, but not about Bavel, since it is far!</p>
<p class="bas indent1"><span class="nm">(h)</span><span class="cl">Answer (R. Yirmeyah):</span> The Mishnah means, all places north of Ako (are like Chutz la'Aretz), except for Bavel.</p>
<p class="bas indent1"><span class="nm">(i)</span><span class="cl">Question:</span> What are the boundaries of Bavel?</p>
<p class="bas indent1"><span class="nm">(j)</span><span class="cl">Answer #1 (Rav Papa):</span> (People of Bavel are established to have good lineage. Amora'im (Kidushin 71b) argue about what is considered Bavel regarding lineage.) Just like they argue about lineage, they argue about Gitin.</p>
<p class="bas indent1"><span class="nm">(k)</span><span class="cl">Answer #2 (Rav Yosef):</span> They argue only about lineage. Regarding Gitin, all agree that Bavel extends until the second willow tree by the bridge.</p>
<p class="bas indent1"><span class="nm">(l)</span>Rav Chisda required a declaration for Gitin sent from Aktisfon to Bei Ardeshir, but not in the other direction.</p>
<p class="bas indent2"><span class="nm">1.</span><span class="cl">Suggestion:</span> He holds that the reason for the declaration is Lishmah. People in Bei Ardeshir know the law, but those in Aktisfon do not.</p>
<p class="bas indent2"><span class="nm">2.</span><span class="cl">Rejection:</span> Even Rabah is concerned for Kiyum!</p>
<p class="bas indent2"><span class="nm">3.</span>Rather, the concern is Kiyum. People of Bei Ardeshir go to the market in Aktisfon, so the people of Aktisfon recognize signatures of people of Bei Ardeshir.</p>
<p class="bas indent2"><span class="nm">4.</span><span class="cl">Question:</span> Why don't the people of Bei Ardeshir recognize signatures of people of Aktisfon?</p>
<p class="bas indent2"><span class="nm">5.</span><span class="cl">Answer:</span> They are busy in the market (and have no time to look at documents).</p>
<p class="bas indent1"><span class="nm">(m)</span>Rabah bar Avuha required a declaration for Gitin sent from one row of houses to the row on the other side of the public road;</p>
<p class="bas indent1"><span class="nm">(n)</span>Rav Sheshes required a declaration for Gitin sent from a group of (three or more) houses to another group;</p>
<p class="bas indent1"><span class="nm">(o)</span>Rava required a declaration for Gitin sent within the same group of houses.</p>
<p class="bas indent1"><span class="nm">(p)</span><span class="cl">Question:</span> Rava holds that the only concern is Kiyum!</p>
<p class="bas indent1"><span class="nm">(q)</span><span class="cl">Answer:</span> The people of Mechuza (Rava's city) are very transient, and do not recognize their neighbors' signatures.</p>
<p class="bas subject"><span class="nm">3)</span>SAYING THE DECLARATION WHEN IT IS NOT REQUIRED</p>
<p class="bas indent1"><span class="nm">(a)</span><span class="cl">(Rav Chanin):</span> A Get was brought, either from Sura to Neharde'a, or vice-versa, and Rav said 'no declaration is required. If you say it, it helps.'</p>
<p class="bas bbbline">6b----------------------------------------6b</p>
<p class="bas indent1"><span class="nm">(b)</span><span class="cl">Question:</span> How does it help?</p>
<p class="bas indent1"><span class="nm">(c)</span><span class="cl">Answer:</span> If the husband will contest the Get, he will be ignored.</p>
<p class="bas indent1"><span class="nm">(d)</span><span class="cl">Support (Beraisa):</span> A man brought a Get from Kefar Sisai in front of R. Yishmael.</p>
<p class="bas indent2"><span class="nm">1.</span><span class="cl">R. Yishmael:</span> You must make the declaration, so the woman will not need witnesses.</p>
<p class="bas indent2"><span class="nm">2.</span><span class="cl">R. Ilai:</span> Why is this needed? Kefar Sisai is enveloped within the borders of Eretz Yisrael, and is closer to Tzipori than Ako!</p>
<p class="bas indent3"><span class="nm">i.</span><span class="cl">(Mishnah - R. Meir):</span> Ako is part of Eretz Yisrael regarding Gitin.</p>
<p class="bas indent3"><span class="nm">ii.</span>Even Chachamim argue with R. Meir only about Ako, for it is far. They would agree about Kefar Sisai!</p>
<p class="bas indent2"><span class="nm">3.</span><span class="cl">R. Yishmael:</span> Hush! It is good that the Get be given in a permitted way.</p>
<p class="bas indent1"><span class="nm">(e)</span><span class="cl">Question:</span> Why did R. Ilai object? R. Yishmael said that the declaration was only to avoid the need for witnesses!</p>
<p class="bas indent1"><span class="nm">(f)</span><span class="cl">Answer:</span> R. Ilai only heard R. Yishmael tell him to make the declaration. He did not hear the reason.</p>
<p class="bas subject"><span class="nm">4)</span>THE RULING OF R. EVYASAR</p>
<p class="bas indent1"><span class="nm">(a)</span><span class="cl">(R. Evyasar):</span> No declaration is needed for Gitin sent from Bavel to Eretz Yisrael.</p>
<p class="bas indent2"><span class="nm">1.</span><span class="cl">Suggestion:</span> He holds that the concern is Lishmah, and the people of Bavel know the law.</p>
<p class="bas indent2"><span class="nm">2.</span><span class="cl">Rejection:</span> Rabah is also concerned for Kiyum!</p>
<p class="bas indent1"><span class="nm">(b)</span><span class="cl">Conclusion:</span> Rather, the concern is Kiyum. Since many people come to Eretz Yisrael from Bavel, witnesses are easily found.</p>
<p class="bas indent1"><span class="nm">(c)</span><span class="cl">Rav Yosef:</span> Is R. Evyasar reliable, so that we can rely on his teaching?!</p>
<p class="bas indent2"><span class="nm">1.</span>He wrote a verse and sent it to Rav Yehudah, without Sirtut (scratching a line to write straight). This is forbidden!</p>
<p class="bas indent3"><span class="nm">i.</span><span class="cl">(R. Evyasar):</span> "They made the boy work for food, and sold the girl for wine" refers to people of Bavel who come to Eretz Yisrael (to learn, and leave their families in Bavel).</p>
<p class="bas indent2"><span class="nm">2.</span><span class="cl">(R. Yitzchak):</span> One may write two words of a verse without Sirtut, but not three.</p>
<p class="bas indent2"><span class="nm">3.</span><span class="cl">(Beraisa):</span> One may write three words of a verse without Sirtut, but not four.</p>
<p class="bas indent1"><span class="nm">(d)</span><span class="cl">Objection #1 (Abaye):</span> Just because he doesn't know R. Yitzchak's law does not show that he is not a great Chacham?</p>
<p class="bas indent2"><span class="nm">1.</span>Granted, an error in reasoning would show that he is not a great Chacham.</p>
<p class="bas indent2"><span class="nm">2.</span>R. Yitzchak's law is a tradition. R. Evyasar never heard it!</p>
<p class="bas indent1"><span class="nm">(e)</span><span class="cl">Objection #2 (Abaye):</span> Also, we find that Hash-m agreed with R. Evyasar (as follows)!</p>
<p class="bas subject"><span class="nm">5)</span>THE CONCUBINE OF GIV'AH</p>
<p class="bas indent1"><span class="nm">(a)</span><span class="cl">(R. Evyasar):</span> "Va'Tizneh Alav Pilagsho (his concubine misbehaved)" - he found a fly (this will be explained);</p>
<p class="bas indent1"><span class="nm">(b)</span><span class="cl">(R. Yonason):</span> He found a hair.</p>
<p class="bas indent1"><span class="nm">(c)</span>R. Evyasar saw Eliyahu, and asked him what Hash-m was doing.</p>
<p class="bas indent2"><span class="nm">1.</span><span class="cl">Eliyahu:</span> He is engaged in the account of the concubine in Givah. This is what My son Evyasar says, this is what My son Yonason says.</p>
<p class="bas indent2"><span class="nm">2.</span><span class="cl">R. Evyasar:</span> Hash-m has no doubts!</p>
<p class="bas indent2"><span class="nm">3.</span><span class="cl">Eliyahu:</span> Both opinions come from Hash-m (are true)! Her husband found a fly and was not upset. He found a hair, and this upset him.</p>
<p class="bas indent1"><span class="nm">(d)</span><span class="cl">Opinion #1 (Rav Yehudah):</span> The fly was in the food she prepared for him. The hair was in the place of Bi'ah. (Va'Tizneh alludes to MaZoN or ZeNus.)</p>
<p class="bas indent2"><span class="nm">1.</span>The fly is merely disgusting. The hair poses a danger (it can cut the Ever. Therefore, this upset him).</p>
<p class="bas indent1"><span class="nm">(e)</span><span class="cl">Opinion #2:</span> Both were in the food;</p>
<p class="bas indent2"><span class="nm">1.</span>A fly in the food is not due to negligence. A hair in the food is due to negligence.</p>
<p class="bas indent1"><span class="nm">(f)</span><span class="cl">(Rav Chisda):</span> One should never instill excessive fear in his house. (The husband of) the concubine of Givah did so, and this caused many tens of thousands of Yisrael to die.</p>
<p class="bas indent1"><span class="nm">(g)</span><span class="cl">(Rav Yehudah):</span> Anyone who instills excessive fear in his house will eventually come to three sins: incest, bloodshed, and desecration of Shabbos (some texts - of Hash-m's name. All of these resulted from the concubine in Givah.)</p>
