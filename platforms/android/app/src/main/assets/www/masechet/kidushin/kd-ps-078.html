<p class="bas subject"><span class="nm">1)</span>LASHES FOR PROFANING</p>
<p class="bas indent1"><span class="nm">(a)</span><span class="cl">(Rav Yehudah):</span> If a Kohen Gadol has Bi'ah with a widow, he is lashed twice (two sets of 39), for "he will not take" and "he will not profane".</p>
<p class="bas indent1"><span class="nm">(b)</span><span class="cl">Question:</span> He should also be lashed for "he will not profane his seed"!</p>
<p class="bas indent1"><span class="nm">(c)</span><span class="cl">Answer:</span> The case is, he did not complete Bi'ah. ("He will not profane his seed" applies only to Bi'ah that could impregnate a woman.)</p>
<p class="bas indent1"><span class="nm">(d)</span><span class="cl">Question (Rava - Beraisa):</span> (If a Kohen Gadol had Bi'ah with) a widow who is a divorcee, he is lashed for each of these Isurim.</p>
<p class="bas indent2"><span class="nm">1.</span><span class="cl">Suggestion:</span> He is lashed once for each Isur.</p>
<p class="bas indent1"><span class="nm">(e)</span><span class="cl">Answer:</span> No, he is lashed twice for each (for "he will not take" and "he will not profane")</p>
<p class="bas indent1"><span class="nm">(f)</span><span class="cl">Question (Seifa):</span> (For Bi'ah with) a divorcee who is a Chalutzah, he is lashed only once.</p>
<p class="bas indent1"><span class="nm">(g)</span><span class="cl">Answer:</span> It means, he is lashed only for one Isur, but he gets two sets for it.</p>
<p class="bas indent1"><span class="nm">(h)</span><span class="cl">Inference:</span> This implies that the Isur of a Chalutzah is only mid'Rabanan.</p>
<p class="bas indent1"><span class="nm">(i)</span><span class="cl">Question (Beraisa):</span> "And a woman divorced from her husband (a Kohen may not take)" includes a Chalutzah.</p>
<p class="bas indent1"><span class="nm">(j)</span><span class="cl">Answer:</span> That is only an Asmachta mid'Rabanan.</p>
<p class="bas indent1"><span class="nm">(k)</span><span class="cl">(Abaye):</span> If a Kohen was Mekadesh a woman forbidden to Kohanim, he is lashed once for "he will not take";</p>
<p class="bas indent2"><span class="nm">1.</span>If he had Bi'ah with her, he is lashed once for "he will not profane".</p>
<p class="bas indent1"><span class="nm">(l)</span><span class="cl">(Rava):</span> He is lashed only if he has Bi'ah with her;</p>
<p class="bas indent2"><span class="nm">1.</span>"He will not take... he will not profane" - taking is forbidden only so he will not profane.</p>
<p class="bas indent1"><span class="nm">(m)</span>Abaye agrees that one who remarries his divorcee is not lashed for Kidushin without Bi'ah. "To take her for a wife" is fulfilled only through Bi'ah.</p>
<p class="bas indent1"><span class="nm">(n)</span>Rava agrees that a Kohen Gadol who has Bi'ah with a widow is lashed, even without Kidushin. "He will not profane his seed among his nation" - Bi'ah alone profanes.</p>
<p class="bas indent1"><span class="nm">(o)</span>Both agree that one who remarries his divorcee is not lashed for Bi'ah without Kidushin. The Torah forbade only through marriage.</p>
<p class="bas subject"><span class="nm">2)</span>CHILDREN OF CONVERTS</p>
<p class="bas indent1"><span class="nm">(a)</span><span class="cl">(Mishnah - Rebbi Yehudah):</span> The daughter of a male convert is like a Chalal's daughter.</p>
<p class="bas indent1"><span class="nm">(b)</span><span class="cl">(Beraisa - Rebbi Yehudah):</span> We learn from a Kal va'Chomer that a male convert's daughter is like a Chalal's daughter:</p>
<p class="bas indent2"><span class="nm">1.</span>A Chalal was fathered by a Yisrael, yet his daughter is disqualified (from Kehunah). A convert was fathered by a Nochri, all the more so his daughter is disqualified!</p>
<p class="bas indent1"><span class="nm">(c)</span><span class="cl">Question:</span> We cannot learn from a Chalal, for he (or one of his ancestors) was conceived through sin!</p>
<p class="bas indent1"><span class="nm">(d)</span><span class="cl">Answer #1:</span> A Kohen Gadol's daughter from a widow is disqualified, even though the Kohen Gadol was not conceived in sin. (This shows that this is not the determining factor.)</p>
<p class="bas indent1"><span class="nm">(e)</span><span class="cl">Question:</span> We cannot learn from a Kohen Gadol's daughter from a widow, for the Bi'ah that led to her was forbidden!</p>
<p class="bas indent1"><span class="nm">(f)</span><span class="cl">Answer:</span> We learn from a Chalal (his daughter is disqualified, even though the Bi'ah that led to her was permitted) that this is not the determining factor;</p>
<p class="bas indent2"><span class="nm">1.</span><span class="cl">Summation:</span> A Chalal and a Kohen Gadol (married to a widow) each have different problems. The Tzad ha'Shavah (what is common to them) is that they are different from the Kahal (they were formed through Isur or have Bi'as Isur), and their daughters are disqualified;</p>
<p class="bas indent2"><span class="nm">2.</span>Also a convert is different from the Kahal (he was fathered by a Nochri), so his daughter is disqualified!</p>
<p class="bas indent1"><span class="nm">(g)</span><span class="cl">Rejection:</span> We cannot learn from a Chalal and a Kohen Gadol. A transgression was involved in each of them!</p>
<p class="bas indent1"><span class="nm">(h)</span><span class="cl">Answer #2:</span> We learn from a Mitzri Rishon (he himself converted). Even though he was not formed through sin, his daughter is forbidden.</p>
<p class="bas indent1"><span class="nm">(i)</span><span class="cl">Question:</span> We cannot learn from a Mitzri Rishon, for he may not marry a Bas Yisrael!</p>
<p class="bas indent1"><span class="nm">(j)</span><span class="cl">Answer:</span> We learn from a Chalal (his daughter is disqualified, even though he is permitted to a Bas Yisrael) that this is not the determining factor.</p>
<p class="bas indent2"><span class="nm">1.</span><span class="cl">Summation:</span> Chalal and a Mitzri each have different problems. What is common to them is that they are different from the Kahal (one was formed through sin and one cannot marry a Bas Yisrael), and their daughters are disqualified;</p>
<p class="bas indent2"><span class="nm">2.</span>Also a convert is different from the Kahal (he was fathered by a Nochri), so his daughter is disqualified!</p>
<p class="bas indent1"><span class="nm">(k)</span><span class="cl">Objection:</span> We cannot learn from a Chalal and a Mitzri. Both of them disqualify a woman (from Kehunah) by having Bi'ah with her!</p>
<p class="bas indent1"><span class="nm">(l)</span><span class="cl">Answer:</span> Indeed, Rebbi Yehudah learns that a convert also disqualifies a woman by having Bi'ah with her, from this Tzad ha'Shavah!</p>
<p class="bas subject"><span class="nm">3)</span>LAWS ALLUDED TO IN YECHEZKEIL</p>
<p class="bas indent1"><span class="nm">(a)</span><span class="cl">(Mishnah - R. Eliezer ben Yakov):</span> If a convert...</p>
<p class="bas indent1"><span class="nm">(b)</span><span class="cl">(Beraisa - R. Shimon):</span> If a girl converted before three years old, she is permitted to Kehunah. Pinchas (a Kohen) was among the soldiers who took captives from Midyan, and they were told "keep all the young girls alive for yourselves (they are permitted to you)";</p>
<p class="bas indent2"><span class="nm">1.</span>Chachamim say, "keep them alive" for slaves.</p>
<p class="bas indent1"><span class="nm">(c)</span>The different opinions among the Tana'im were learned from "they (Kohanim) will not marry a widow or divorcee, rather virgins from the seed of Yisrael".</p>
<p class="bas indent2"><span class="nm">1.</span>Rebbi Yehudah expounds that (a girl may marry a Kohen if) all the (primary) seed (i.e. the father's) must be from Yisrael;</p>
<p class="bas indent2"><span class="nm">2.</span>R. Eliezer ben Yakov expounds "from the seed of Yisrael" - it suffices if one parent is a Yisrael;</p>
<p class="bas indent2"><span class="nm">3.</span>Rebbi Yosi expounds that she must be seeded in Yisrael (her parents are Yisre'elim);</p>
<p class="bas indent2"><span class="nm">4.</span>R. Shimon expounds that she must be a Yisre'elis when her Besulim (tokens of virginity) finish growing (at the age of three).</p>
<p class="bas indent1"><span class="nm">(d)</span><span class="cl">Question (Rav Nachman):</span> The Reisha of the verse discusses a Kohen Gadol (a widow is forbidden), but the Seifa ("a widow... they will marry") discusses a regular Kohen!</p>
<p class="bas bbbline">78b----------------------------------------78b</p>
<p class="bas indent1"><span class="nm">(e)</span><span class="cl">Answer (Rava):</span> Yes!</p>
<p class="bas indent1"><span class="nm">(f)</span><span class="cl">Question (Rav Nachman):</span> Do verses change like that?</p>
<p class="bas indent1"><span class="nm">(g)</span><span class="cl">Answer (Rava):</span> Yes! "The lamp of Hash-m did not yet go out, and Shmuel was lying down in the Heichal";</p>
<p class="bas indent2"><span class="nm">1.</span><span class="cl">Question:</span> Only kings from the line of David may sit in the Mikdash!</p>
<p class="bas indent2"><span class="nm">2.</span><span class="cl">Answer:</span> Rather, the verse means 'the lamp of Hash-m did not yet go out in the Heichal, and Shmuel was lying down (elsewhere).</p>
<p class="bas indent1"><span class="nm">(h)</span><span class="cl">Question:</span> Why does it say "a widow who will be a widow from a Kohen, they (Kohanim) may marry"? A Kohen may marry also a widow from a Yisrael!</p>
<p class="bas indent1"><span class="nm">(i)</span><span class="cl">Answer #1:</span> It means, from the Kohanim (i.e. Hedyotim, but not a Kohen Gadol), they may marry a widow.</p>
<p class="bas indent1"><span class="nm">(j)</span><span class="cl">Answer #2 (Rebbi Yehudah):</span> Kohanim may marry widows of men whose daughters are permitted to Kohanim.</p>
<p class="bas indent2"><span class="nm">1.</span>This is like Rebbi Yehudah's opinion that a male convert's daughter is like a Chalal's daughter;</p>
<p class="bas indent2"><span class="nm">2.</span>A Kohen may marry Reuven's widow only if he may marry Reuven's daughter.</p>
<p class="bas subject"><span class="nm">4)</span>THE FINAL RULING</p>
<p class="bas indent1"><span class="nm">(a)</span><span class="cl">(Mishnah - Rebbi Yosi):</span> Even if a convert married a convert (his daughter is permitted to Kehunah).</p>
<p class="bas indent1"><span class="nm">(b)</span><span class="cl">(Rav Hamnuna):</span> The Halachah follows Rebbi Yosi.</p>
<p class="bas indent1"><span class="nm">(c)</span><span class="cl">(Rabah bar bar Chanah):</span> The Halachah follows Rebbi Yosi, but after the Churban, Kohanim conduct stringently like R. Eliezer ben Yakov.</p>
<p class="bas indent1"><span class="nm">(d)</span><span class="cl">(Rav Nachman):</span> If a Kohen asks, we tell him that the Halachah follows R. Eliezer ben Yakov. If he married the daughter of converts, he may stay married, like Rebbi Yosi.</p>
<p class="bas subject"><span class="nm">5)</span>A MAN IS BELIEVED ABOUT HIS CHILDREN</p>
<p class="bas indent1"><span class="nm">(a)</span><span class="cl">(Mishnah):</span> If Reuven said 'my son Shimon is a Mamzer', he is not believed;</p>
<p class="bas indent1"><span class="nm">(b)</span>Even if Reuven and his wife say that she is pregnant with a Mamzer, they are not believed;</p>
<p class="bas indent1"><span class="nm">(c)</span>Rebbi Yehudah says, they are believed.</p>
<p class="bas indent1"><span class="nm">(d)</span><span class="cl">(Gemara) Question:</span> Why does it say 'Even if they both say'?</p>
<p class="bas indent1"><span class="nm">(e)</span><span class="cl">Answer:</span> This teaches a bigger Chidush. Not only if he says, for he is not sure if she is pregnant from him, but even if she also says (and she is sure), they are not believed;</p>
<p class="bas indent2"><span class="nm">1.</span>Further, not only when the child has a Chezkas Kashrus (i.e. they did not say that he is a Mamzer until after he was born), but even regarding a fetus, which has no Chazakah, they are not believed.</p>
<p class="bas indent1"><span class="nm">(f)</span><span class="cl">(Mishnah - Rebbi Yehudah):</span> They are believed.</p>
<p class="bas indent1"><span class="nm">(g)</span><span class="cl">(Beraisa - Rebbi Yehudah):</span> "Yakir" - the father will make known whom is his firstborn;</p>
<p class="bas indent2"><span class="nm">1.</span>This teaches that a man is believed to say which son is his firstborn. Similarly, he is believed to say that a certain son was born from a divorcee or Chalutzah (so the son is a Chalal);</p>
<p class="bas indent2"><span class="nm">2.</span>Chachamim say, he is not believed to say that his son is a Chalal.</p>
<p class="bas indent1"><span class="nm">(h)</span><span class="cl">Question (Rav Nachman bar Yitzchak):</span> This shows how Rebbi Yehudah expounds "Yakir". What do Chachamim learn from it?</p>
<p class="bas indent1"><span class="nm">(i)</span><span class="cl">Answer (Rava):</span> When we do not know who is the firstborn, the father is believed.</p>
<p class="bas indent1"><span class="nm">(j)</span><span class="cl">Question:</span> Is he believed so that the son inherits a double portion? Even without a verse, since the father could give his son an extra portion for a gift, he is believed to say that he inherits a double portion!</p>
<p class="bas indent1"><span class="nm">(k)</span><span class="cl">Answer:</span> This would not suffice to give the son an extra share in property that came to the father afterwards.</p>
<p class="bas indent1"><span class="nm">(l)</span><span class="cl">Question:</span> R. Meir holds that a man can transfer ownership of something not yet in the world (e.g. property that he will later receive). If so, the father could give an extra share of all property he will receive. Why must the Torah teach that he is believed about the firstborn?</p>
<p class="bas indent1"><span class="nm">(m)</span><span class="cl">Answer:</span> Such a gift would not help for property that falls to the father when the father is Goses (dying, and unable to give a gift).</p>
