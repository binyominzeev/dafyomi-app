<p class="bas subject"><span class="nm">1)</span>ANNULMENT OF A VOW WITHOUT HEARING IT</p>
<p class="bas indent1"><span class="nm">(a)</span><span class="cl">Rejection:</span> The case is, he said that the vow will be annulled when he hears it.</p>
<p class="bas indent2"><span class="nm">1.</span><span class="cl">Question:</span> If so, why does he say this now? He can annul the vows when he hears them!</p>
<p class="bas indent2"><span class="nm">2.</span><span class="cl">Answer:</span> He is concerned lest he be distracted when he hears them, and will forget to annul them.</p>
<p class="bas indent1"><span class="nm">(b)</span><span class="cl">Question (Rami bar Chama):</span> Can a deaf man annul his wife's vows?</p>
<p class="bas indent2"><span class="nm">1.</span>If you will say that a (hearing) husband can annul his wife's vows without hearing them, this is because he is capable of hearing them, but a deaf man cannot annul, for he is incapable of hearing them, like R. Zeira's law.</p>
<p class="bas indent3"><span class="nm">i.</span><span class="cl">(R. Zeira):</span> If a Minchah could be kneaded (it has at most 60 Esronim of flour), it is Kosher even if it was not kneaded. If it could not be kneaded (it is too big to mix in the Kli, or one Log of oil cannot be mixed with all the flour), it is Pasul because it was not kneaded.</p>
<p class="bas indent2"><span class="nm">2.</span>Or, perhaps we do not even require that the husband could hear it!</p>
<p class="bas indent1"><span class="nm">(c)</span><span class="cl">Answer (Rava - Beraisa):</span> "And her husband heard" excludes a deaf man's wife.</p>
<p class="bas indent1"><span class="nm">(d)</span><span class="cl">Question:</span> Can a man annul the vows of his two wives at once?</p>
<p class="bas indent2"><span class="nm">1.</span>Does the singular "He will annul Osah (her, i.e. her vow)" teach that he can annul only one wife at a time, or not?</p>
<p class="bas indent1"><span class="nm">(e)</span><span class="cl">Answer (Ravina - Beraisa):</span> We do not give two Sotos to drink at the same time, since when one sees the other drink, it will embrazen her, and she will not confess;</p>
<p class="bas indent2"><span class="nm">1.</span>R. Yehudah says, this is not the reason. Rather, it says "He will give Osah to drink", i.e. alone. (Similarly, the first Tana would allow annulling two wives at once, and R. Yehudah would not.)</p>

<p class="bas subject"><span class="nm">2)</span>ANNULMENT DURING <i>EIRUSIN</i></p>
<p class="bas indent1"><span class="nm">(a)</span><span class="cl">(Mishnah - R. Eliezer):</span> If a Bogeres has waited 12 months (during Eirusin), or a widow has  waited 30 days, since her Arus must feed her, he can annul her vows;</p>
<p class="bas indent1"><span class="nm">(b)</span>Chachamim say that he cannot annul until she enters his Reshus (Nisu'in).</p>
<p class="bas indent1"><span class="nm">(c)</span><span class="cl">(Gemara - Rabah):</span> R. Eliezer and the original Mishnah (regarding Kesuvos) agree with each other.</p>
<p class="bas indent2"><span class="nm">1.</span><span class="cl">(Mishnah):</span> A virgin is given 12 months from Eirusin to prepare for Nisu'in. After this time (if her Arus failed to make Nisu'in), he must feed her, and she may eat Terumah (if he is a Kohen);</p>
<p class="bas indent2"><span class="nm">2.</span>If she is Shomeres Yavam(awaiting Yibum) to a Kohen, this does not permit her to eat Terumah;</p>
<p class="bas indent3"><span class="nm">i.</span>If only 12 months have passed from the Kidushin, whether her Arus died towards the beginning, middle, or end (and the rest of the time she was Shomeres Yavam), she does not eat Terumah;</p>
<p class="bas indent2"><span class="nm">3.</span>All this is according to the original Mishnah. A later Beis Din ruled that a Kohen's wife may not eat Terumah until the Chupah.</p>
<p class="bas indent1"><span class="nm">(d)</span><span class="cl">Objection (Abaye):</span> Perhaps R. Eliezer and the original Mishnah disagree!</p>
<p class="bas indent2"><span class="nm">1.</span>Perhaps the original Mishnah allows her to eat only Terumah mid'Rabanan, but it would not allow him to annul her vows, which are mid'Oraisa, before Chupah!</p>
<p class="bas indent2"><span class="nm">2.</span>Or, perhaps R. Eliezer allows him to annul her vows before Chupah due to Rav Pinchas' law, but he would not allow her to eat even Terumah mid'Rabanan!</p>
<p class="bas indent3"><span class="nm">i.</span><span class="cl">(Rav Pinchas):</span> A wife always intends that her vow be valid only if her husband will consent to it. (Since he feeds her, she considers him to be like her husband regarding vows.)</p>
