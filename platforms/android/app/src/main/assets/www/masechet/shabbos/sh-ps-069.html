<p class="bas subject"><span class="nm">1)</span>WHAT SHEGEGAH DOES MUNVAZ REQUIRE?</p>
<p class="bas indent1"><span class="nm">(a)</span><span class="cl">Question:</span> [Munvaz obligates Shogeg even though he knew -] in what sense was he Shogeg?</p>
<p class="bas indent1"><span class="nm">(b)</span><span class="cl">Answer:</span> He did not know that one must bring a Korban for it.</p>
<p class="bas indent1"><span class="nm">(c)</span>Chachamim argue - they hold that Shigegas Korban is not considered Shogeg.</p>
<p class="bas indent1"><span class="nm">(d)</span><span class="cl">Question:</span> What kind of Shegagah do Chachamim require?</p>
<p class="bas indent1"><span class="nm">(e)</span><span class="cl">Answer #1 (R. Yochanan):</span> It suffices if he was Shogeg about Kares, even if he know that it is forbidden by a Lav;</p>
<p class="bas indent1"><span class="nm">(f)</span><span class="cl">Answer #2 (Reish Lakish):</span> He must be Shogeg about Kares and the Lav.</p>
<p class="bas indent1"><span class="nm">(g)</span><span class="cl">(Rava):</span> Reish Lakish learns from "Asher <i>Lo</i> Se'asenah bi'Shgagah v'Ashem" - he must be Shogeg about Kares and the Lav.</p>
<p class="bas indent1"><span class="nm">(h)</span><span class="cl">Question:</span> What does R. Yochanan learn from this?</p>
<p class="bas indent1"><span class="nm">(i)</span><span class="cl">Answer (Beraisa):</span> "Me'Am ha'Aretz" - this excludes a Mumar;</p>
<p class="bas indent2"><span class="nm">1.</span>R. Shimon bar Yosi says, "Asher Lo Se'asenah bi'Shgagah v'Ashem" - one brings a Korban only if he would have refrained had he known that it is forbidden.</p>
<p class="bas subject"><span class="nm">2)</span>A KORBAN FOR EACH MELACHAH</p>
<p class="bas indent1"><span class="nm">(a)</span><span class="cl">(Mishnah):</span> There are 39 Avos Melachos.</p>
<p class="bas indent1"><span class="nm">(b)</span><span class="cl">Question:</span> Why do we need to know the number?</p>
<p class="bas indent1"><span class="nm">(c)</span><span class="cl">Answer (R. Yochanan):</span> This teaches that is one did all of them in one Helam, he is liable for each.</p>
<p class="bas indent1"><span class="nm">(d)</span><span class="cl">Question:</span> In what case is he liable for each Melachah?</p>
<p class="bas indent1"><span class="nm">(e)</span><span class="cl">Answer:</span> He knew that it was Shabbos, he forgot the Melachos.</p>
<p class="bas indent1"><span class="nm">(f)</span>According to R. Yochanan, we can say that he remembered that a Lav forbids Melachah, he forgot that there is Kares.</p>
<p class="bas indent1"><span class="nm">(g)</span><span class="cl">Question:</span> According to Reish Lakish, he must be Shogeg even about the Lav [to bring a Korban] - if he forgot all of the Melachos, in what way did he remember Shabbos?!</p>
<p class="bas indent1"><span class="nm">(h)</span><span class="cl">Answer:</span> He remembered that one may not leave the Techum. Our Mishnah is like R. Akiva, who forbids this mid'Oraisa (to go past 12 Mil from the city. He agrees that the Techum of 2,000 Amos is only mid'Rabanan. Ritva - we could have given other answers, e.g. he remembered the Toldos but forgot Avos - we prefer to teach a Chidush according to R. Akiva, since our Mishnah is like him.)</p>
<p class="bas indent1"><span class="nm">(i)</span><span class="cl">Question:</span> Who is the Tana of the following Beraisa?</p>
<p class="bas indent2"><span class="nm">1.</span><span class="cl">(Beraisa):</span> If he was Shogeg about both [Shabbos and the Melachos], this is [the ultimate] Shogeg; if he was Mezid about both, this is [the ultimate] Mezid;</p>
<p class="bas indent2"><span class="nm">2.</span>If he was Shogeg about Shabbos and Mezid about the Melachos, or vice-versa, or if he knew that the Melachah is forbidden but he thought that he is not Chayav Korban for it, he brings a Korban.</p>
<p class="bas indent1"><span class="nm">(j)</span><span class="cl">Answer:</span> It is like Munvaz.</p>
<p class="bas subject"><span class="nm">3)</span>THE SHEGEGAH FOR OTHER CHIYUVIM</p>
<p class="bas indent1"><span class="nm">(a)</span><span class="cl">(Abaye):</span> All agree that one is not Chayav Korban for Shevu'as Bituy (an oath to do or not to do something, or that he did or did not do it) unless he was Shogeg about the Lav.</p>
<p class="bas indent1"><span class="nm">(b)</span>[There is no reason to say that Munvaz would say so -] Abaye means, R. Yochanan agrees [according to Chachamim].</p>
<p class="bas indent1"><span class="nm">(c)</span><span class="cl">Objection:</span> This is obvious - R. Yochanan only said that he can be Mezid about the Lav regarding Chayavei Kerisus, when he was Shogeg about Kares - here, there is no Kares, he must be Shogeg about the Lav!</p>
<p class="bas indent1"><span class="nm">(d)</span><span class="cl">Answer:</span> Normally, one is not Chayav Korban for a Lav, Shevu'as Bituy is an exception - one might have thought that one is likewise liable even though he was Mezid about the Lav! Abaye teaches, this is not so.</p>
<p class="bas bbbline">69b----------------------------------------69b</p>
<p class="bas indent1"><span class="nm">(e)</span><span class="cl">Question (Beraisa) Question:</span> When is a sacrifice brought for Shevu'as Bituy about the past? (We cannot say that he intended to swear truthfully but erred, this is not considered transgressing at all.)</p>
<p class="bas indent2"><span class="nm">1.</span><span class="cl">Answer:</span> He swore falsely, knowing that this is forbidden, but he did not know whether a sacrifice is brought for this.</p>
<p class="bas indent1"><span class="nm">(f)</span><span class="cl">Version #1 - Answer:</span> The Beraisa is like Munvaz [who does not require Shigegas Kares]. (Rashi deletes Version #2 from the text.)</p>
<p class="bas indent1"><span class="nm">(g)</span><span class="cl">Version #2 - Suggestion:</span> Perhaps this is like Munvaz.</p>
<p class="bas indent1"><span class="nm">(h)</span><span class="cl">Rejection:</span> Regarding other Mitzvos, there is no Chidush, Munvaz does not require Shigegas Kares - Shevu'as ha'Edus is a Chidush, he would not need to teach that Shigegas Lav is not required!</p>
<p class="bas indent1"><span class="nm">(i)</span><span class="cl">Conclusion:</span> We must say that the Beraisa is like Chachamim.</p>
<p class="bas indent1"><span class="nm">(j)</span>Abaye is refuted. (end of Version #2)</p>
<p class="bas indent1"><span class="nm">(k)</span><span class="cl">(Abaye):</span> All agree that a Zar need not add a Chomesh for eating Terumah b'Shogeg unless he was Shogeg about the Lav.</p>
<p class="bas indent1"><span class="nm">(l)</span>He means, R. Yochanan agrees.</p>
<p class="bas indent1"><span class="nm">(m)</span><span class="cl">Objection:</span> This is obvious - R. Yochanan only discussed Chayavei Kerisus, when he was Shogeg about Kares - here, there is no Kares, he must be Shogeg about the Lav!</p>
<p class="bas indent1"><span class="nm">(n)</span><span class="cl">Answer:</span> One might have thought that the Chiyuv Misah bi'Dei Shamayim of Terumah is in place of Kares, he is liable if he was Shogeg about Misah even though he was Mezid about the Lav! Abaye teaches, this is not so.</p>
<p class="bas indent1"><span class="nm">(o)</span><span class="cl">(Rava):</span> R. Yochanan obligates adding a Chomesh even if he was Mezid about the Lav;</p>
<p class="bas indent2"><span class="nm">1.</span>Misah is in place of Kares, the Chomesh is in place of the Korban.</p>
<p class="bas subject"><span class="nm">4)</span>ONE WHO FORGOT WHICH DAY IS SHABBOS</p>
<p class="bas indent1"><span class="nm">(a)</span><span class="cl">(Rav Huna):</span> If one is lost in the wilderness and does not know which day is Shabbos, he counts six days and guards the seventh [like Shabbos, and every seventh day after this];</p>
<p class="bas indent1"><span class="nm">(b)</span><span class="cl">(Chiya bar Rav):</span> He guards one day (the morrow - it is improper to consider today Shabbos, since he was not guarding it until now) and counts six.</p>
<p class="bas indent1"><span class="nm">(c)</span><span class="cl">Question:</span> What do they argue about?</p>
<p class="bas indent1"><span class="nm">(d)</span><span class="cl">Answer:</span> Rav Huna learns from creation (the seventh day was Shabbos), Chiya bar Rav learns from Adam ha'Rishon (his first complete day was Shabbos).</p>
<p class="bas indent1"><span class="nm">(e)</span><span class="cl">Question #1 (against Chiya bar Rav - Beraisa):</span> If one is on the road and does not know which day is Shabbos, he guards one day l'Shishah.</p>
<p class="bas indent2"><span class="nm">1.</span><span class="cl">Suggestion:</span> This means, he guards one day after counting six!</p>
<p class="bas indent1"><span class="nm">(f)</span><span class="cl">Answer:</span> No, it means he guards one day and counts six.</p>
<p class="bas indent1"><span class="nm">(g)</span><span class="cl">Objection:</span> If so, it should say so [instead of 'one day l'Shishah']!</p>
<p class="bas indent1"><span class="nm">(h)</span><span class="cl">Question #2 (Beraisa):</span> If one is on the road or in the wilderness and does not know which day is Shabbos, he counts six days and guards the seventh.</p>
<p class="bas indent1"><span class="nm">(i)</span>Chiya bar Rav is refuted.</p>
<p class="bas indent1"><span class="nm">(j)</span><span class="cl">(Rava):</span> Every day other than 'his Shabbos' [is really Safek Shabbos, so] he does only Melachah [e.g. obtaining food] necessary to live that day.</p>
<p class="bas indent1"><span class="nm">(k)</span><span class="cl">Objection:</span> If he may not do even Melachah necessary to live on his Shabbos, he will die!</p>
<p class="bas indent1"><span class="nm">(l)</span><span class="cl">Answer:</span> On his Erev Shabbos, he prepares extra food for his Shabbos.</p>
<p class="bas indent1"><span class="nm">(m)</span><span class="cl">Rejection:</span> Perhaps his Erev Shabbos is really Shabbos [he is liable for preparing food for Motzei Shabbos]!</p>
<p class="bas indent1"><span class="nm">(n)</span><span class="cl">Correction:</span> Rather every day including his Shabbos he does only Melachah necessary to live that day.</p>
<p class="bas indent1"><span class="nm">(o)</span><span class="cl">Question:</span> If so, how is his Shabbos different than the other days?</p>
<p class="bas indent1"><span class="nm">(p)</span><span class="cl">Answer:</span> He makes Kidush at the start of the day, and Havdalah when it ends (Mishnah Berurah - if possible, with wine or bread; if not, in Shemoneh Esre).</p>
<p class="bas indent1"><span class="nm">(q)</span><span class="cl">(Rava):</span> If he knows how many days it has been since he began his journey, [surely it was not Shabbos,] he may do unlimited Melachah every seventh day from then.</p>
<p class="bas indent1"><span class="nm">(r)</span><span class="cl">Objection:</span> This is obvious!</p>
<p class="bas indent1"><span class="nm">(s)</span><span class="cl">Answer:</span> One might have thought that we may also assume that he did not leave on Erev Shabbos, and that day should also be permitted every week - Rava teaches, this is not so, sometimes one finds a caravan leaving on Erev Shabbos and goes with it.</p>
<p class="bas subject"><span class="nm">5)</span>THE SOURCE FOR THE DISTINCTION</p>
<p class="bas indent1"><span class="nm">(a)</span><span class="cl">(Mishnah):</span> If he knew about Shabbos...</p>
<p class="bas indent1"><span class="nm">(b)</span><span class="cl">Question:</span> What is the source [that he is liable for each Shabbos]?</p>
<p class="bas indent1"><span class="nm">(c)</span><span class="cl">Answer (Rav Nachman):</span> It says "V'Shomru Venei Yisrael Es ha'<i>Shabbos</i>", implying one Shemirah (observance) for many Shabbosos (Shabbos in the singular, even if he transgressed many Shabbosos, it is as if he transgressed one, he brings only one Korban);</p>
<p class="bas indent2"><span class="nm">1.</span>It also says "V'Es <i>Shabsosai</i> Tishmoru", connoting one Shemirah [and Chiyuv Korban] for each Shabbos! (It is reasonable that he is liable only once when he totally forgot Shabbos, for this is one Shegegah; liability for each Shabbos is for remembering Shabbos but forgetting that today is Shabbos, for then each Shabbos is a separate Shegagah.)</p>
<p class="bas indent1"><span class="nm">(d)</span><span class="cl">Objection (Rav Nachman bar Yitzchak):</span> Just the contrary! (He agrees with the Halachah, he just argues about the connotations of the verses.)</p>
<p class="bas indent2"><span class="nm">1.</span>"V'Shomru Venei Yisrael Es ha'Shabbos" implies that each Shabbos has its own Shemirah; "V'Es Shabsosai Tishmoru", connotes one [collective] Shemirah for many Shabbosos!</p>
