<div class="subject"><span class="nm">1)</span><p>BABIES MIXED UP FROM BIRTH (cont.)</p></div>
<div class="indent1"><span class="nm">(a)</span><p><span class="cl">(Gemara) Question:</span> (When a son of Reuven or Shimon died within 30 days,) if they gave to different Kohanim, the Kohanim keep the money. Each can say (perhaps) I received money for the living child;</p></div>
<div class="indent2"><span class="nm">1.</span><p>Also if they gave to the same Kohen, he can tell each of them, perhaps your son is alive. (I need not return your money!)</p></div>
<div class="indent1"><span class="nm">(b)</span><p><span class="cl">Answer (Shmuel):</span> The case is, Reuven made a Harsha'ah (authorizing Shimon to collect for him, in case Reuven's son died.)</p></div>
<div class="indent1"><span class="nm">(c)</span><p><span class="cl">Question:</span> Chachamim of Neharda'a (Shmuel's city) say that we do not write a Harsha'ah on Metaltelim!</p></div>
<div class="indent1"><span class="nm">(d)</span><p><span class="cl">Answer:</span> That is only if the other party denies the matter (for then, it looks like a lie). If not, it may be written.</p></div>
<div class="indent1"><span class="nm">(e)</span><p><span class="cl">(Mishnah):</span> If they gave birth to a boy and a girl (each a Peter Rechem, the fathers are exempt).</p></div>
<div class="indent1"><span class="nm">(f)</span><p><span class="cl">(Rav Huna):</span> If they gave birth to two boys and a girl, the Kohen does not receive anything (perhaps only one boy is a Peter Rechem, and we do not know which boy, or who is his father.)</p></div>
<div class="indent1"><span class="nm">(g)</span><p>Our Tana did not teach this case, because the law (that the Kohen does not receive anything) applies only to two fathers, but not to two wives of one man.</p></div>
<div class="subject"><span class="nm">2)</span><p>PIDYON IS AFTER 30 DAYS</p></div>
<div class="indent1"><span class="nm">(a)</span><p><span class="cl">(Mishnah):</span> If Reuven's Bechor died within 30 days of birth, (Reuven is exempt;) even if Reuven already gave five Shekalim to a Kohen, the money is returned;</p></div>
<div class="indent1"><span class="nm">(b)</span><p>If he died after 30 days, even if Reuven had not yet given five Shekalim, he must give now;</p></div>
<div class="indent1"><span class="nm">(c)</span><p>If he died on day 30, this is like dying within 30 days;</p></div>
<div class="indent1"><span class="nm">(d)</span><p>R. Akiva says, if he already gave five Shekalim, it is not returned. If he did not yet give, he need not give.</p></div>
<div class="indent1"><span class="nm">(e)</span><p><span class="cl">(Gemara) Question:</span> What is Chachamim's reason?</p></div>
<div class="indent1"><span class="nm">(f)</span><p><span class="cl">Answer:</span> They learn a Gezeirah Shavah "Chodesh-Chodesh" from the counting of the Bechoros in the Midbar;</p></div>
<div class="indent2"><span class="nm">1.</span><p>Just like only Bechoros <i>above</i> 30 days were counted, also Pidyon ha'Ben applies only after 30 days.</p></div>
<div class="indent1"><span class="nm">(g)</span><p>R. Akiva is unsure whether we learn from there;</p></div>
<div class="indent2"><span class="nm">1.</span><p>It says "va'Ma'alah" regarding Erchin to teach that a 30-day old is like less than 30 days (he has no Erech). We do not learn this from Bechoros (in the Midbar). Therefore, Erchin and Bechoros are Shnei Kesuvim, we do not learn from them to other places.</p></div>
<div class="indent2"><span class="nm">2.</span><p>R. Akiva is unsure. Granted, we do not learn to other places, but perhaps Pidyon ha'Ben is considered the same matter! (The Bechoros were counted for the sake of redemption.)</p></div>
<div class="indent1"><span class="nm">(h)</span><p><span class="cl">Version #1 - our text - (Rav Ashi):</span> All agree that regarding Aveilus (mourning), a baby that died on day 30 is like one who died before 30 days. (He is assumed to be a Nefel, so we do not mourn over him.)</p></div>
<div class="indent1"><span class="nm">(i)</span><p><span class="cl">Version #2 - R. Gershom - (Rav Ashi):</span> All agree that the 30th day of Aveilus is like after 30 days. (One may launder and shave.) (end of Version #2)</p></div>
<div class="indent1"><span class="nm">(j)</span><p><span class="cl">(Shmuel):</span> In Aveilus, the Halachah always follows the lenient opinion.</p></div>
<div class="subject"><span class="nm">3)</span><p>PIDYON WITHIN 30 DAYS</p></div>
<div class="indent1"><span class="nm">(a)</span><p><span class="cl">(Mishnah):</span> If Reuven died before his Bechor was 30 days old, we assume that he did not redeem him, the son must redeem himself (when he matures) unless he brings proof that he was redeemed;</p></div>
<div class="indent1"><span class="nm">(b)</span><p>If Reuven died after 30 days, we assume that he redeemed him, unless people tell the son that Reuven said (shortly before he died) that he did not redeem him.</p></div>
<div class="indent1"><span class="nm">(c)</span><p>If Shimon must redeem himself and his son, he redeems himself first;</p></div>
<div class="indent1"><span class="nm">(d)</span><p>R. Yehudah says, he redeems his son first, for the Mitzvah to redeem Shimon was incumbent on Shimon's father, but the Mitzvah to redeem Shimon's son is on Shimon.</p></div>
<div class="indent1"><span class="nm">(e)</span><p><span class="cl">(Gemara - Rav):</span> If Pidyon ha'Ben was done within 30 days, it is valid;</p></div>
<div class="indent1"><span class="nm">(f)</span><p><span class="cl">(Shmuel):</span> It is invalid.</p></div>
<div class="indent1"><span class="nm">(g)</span><p>If he said that the Pidyon should take effect immediately, all agree that it is invalid;</p></div>
<div class="indent2"><span class="nm">1.</span><p>If he gave the money now to take effect after 30 days, and the Kohen still has the money then, all agree that it is valid;</p></div>
<div class="indent2"><span class="nm">2.</span><p>They argue when he gave the money now to take effect after 30 days, and the Kohen does not have the money then;</p></div>
<div class="indent3"><span class="nm">i.</span><p>Rav says that it is valid, just like Kidushin. (If Reuven gave money now to Leah to be Mekadesh her after 30 days, it takes effect then, even if the money was already consumed);</p></div>
<div class="bbbline">49b----------------------------------------49b</p></div>
<div class="indent3"><span class="nm">ii.</span><p>Shmuel says that Kidushin is different, for he could be Mekadesh her right now, but Pidyon cannot be done within 30 days.</p></div>
<div class="indent1"><span class="nm">(h)</span><p>Normally, when Rav and Shmuel argued about Isurim (non-monetary laws), the Halachah follows Rav. However, in this case the Halachah follows Shmuel.</p></div>
<div class="indent1"><span class="nm">(i)</span><p><span class="cl">Question (against Shmuel - Mishnah):</span> If Reuven's Bechor died within 30 days, even if he already gave five Shekalim, the money is returned.</p></div>
<div class="indent2"><span class="nm">1.</span><p><span class="cl">Inference:</span> Had the Bechor not died, the Pidyon would be valid, even though it was done within 30 days!</p></div>
<div class="indent1"><span class="nm">(j)</span><p><span class="cl">Answer:</span> The case is, (he gave the money to take effect after 30 days;) the Kohen still has the money after 30 days.</p></div>
<div class="indent1"><span class="nm">(k)</span><p><span class="cl">Question (against Shmuel - Mishnah):</span> (If Reuven died within 30 days,) we assume that he did not redeem him, unless the son brings proof that he was redeemed.</p></div>
<div class="indent2"><span class="nm">1.</span><p><span class="cl">Inference:</span> If the son brings proof, the Pidyon is valid, even though it was done within 30 days!</p></div>
<div class="indent1"><span class="nm">(l)</span><p><span class="cl">Answer:</span> Also there, the Kohen still has the money after 30 days.</p></div>
<div class="indent1"><span class="nm">(m)</span><p><span class="cl">(A reciter of Beraisos):</span> If Pidyon ha'Ben was done within 30 days, it is valid.</p></div>
<div class="indent1"><span class="nm">(n)</span><p><span class="cl">Objection (Rav Yehudah):</span> That is wrong, for it is unlike Shmuel!</p></div>
<div class="indent2"><span class="nm">1.</span><p>Even though normally the Halachah follows Rav in Isurim, here the Halachah follows Shmuel.</p></div>
<div class="subject"><span class="nm">4)</span><p>PRECEDENCE FOR PIDYON HA'BEN</p></div>
<div class="indent1"><span class="nm">(a)</span><p><span class="cl">(Mishnah):</span> If a man must redeem himself and his son, he first redeems himself.</p></div>
<div class="indent1"><span class="nm">(b)</span><p><span class="cl">(Beraisa):</span> If a man must redeem himself and his son, he first redeems himself;</p></div>
<div class="indent1"><span class="nm">(c)</span><p>Rebbi Yehudah says, he first redeems his son, for it is his own Mitzvah to redeem himself, but his son's redemption is the son's Mitzvah placed on the father!</p></div>
<div class="indent1"><span class="nm">(d)</span><p><span class="cl">(R. Yirmiyah):</span> If the father only has five Shekalim, all agree that he redeems himself. His own Mitzvah takes precedence;</p></div>
<div class="indent2"><span class="nm">1.</span><p>They argue in a case when he has five Shekalim of Bnei Chorin (property he still owns) and five Shekalim of Meshu'abadim (property that he sold);</p></div>
<div class="indent2"><span class="nm">2.</span><p>Rebbi Yehudah holds that Milveh ha'Kesuvah b'Torah (a debt that the Torah was Mechadesh) is like a debt for which there is a document. [The Kohen] can take the Meshu'abadim from the buyer for the father's redemption, so [the father] uses the five of Bnei Chorin to redeem his son;</p></div>
<div class="indent2"><span class="nm">3.</span><p>Chachamim hold that Milveh ha'Kesuvah b'Torah is not like a debt with a document. Therefore, his own Mitzvah comes first.</p></div>
<div class="subject"><span class="nm">5)</span><p>THE SELA'IM OF PIDYON HA'BEN</p></div>
<div class="indent1"><span class="nm">(a)</span><p><span class="cl">(Mishnah):</span> All of the following are paid in Shekel ha'Kodesh (which is a Sela, twice a regular Shekel), in Maneh Tzuri (this will be explained):</p></div>
<div class="indent2"><span class="nm">1.</span><p>The five Sela'im of Pidyon ha'Ben, the 30 Shekalim for a slave (gored by a Mu'ad animal), the 50 Shekalim that an rapist or enticer pays, the 100 Shekalim paid by a Motzi Shem Ra;</p></div>
<div class="indent2"><span class="nm">2.</span><p>All of them are redeemed with money or something worth money, except for (half-) Shekalim (that men must give to Hekdesh every year for Korbanos Tzibur).</p></div>
<div class="indent1"><span class="nm">(b)</span><p><span class="cl">(Gemara) Question:</span> What is "Maneh Tzuri"?</p></div>
<div class="indent1"><span class="nm">(c)</span><p><span class="cl">Answer (R. Asi):</span> It is the Maneh used in Tzur (25 Sela'im of pure silver, each Sela is four Zuz. Standard coins are seven eighths copper, and are worth only one eighth as much.)</p></div>
<div class="indent1"><span class="nm">(d)</span><p><span class="cl">Version #1 - Rashi - (R. Ami):</span> A Sela Tzuri is (Chazon Ish - four times) a Dinar Aravi. The latter is seven tenths of a regular Dinar.</p></div>
<div class="indent1"><span class="nm">(e)</span><p><span class="cl">(R. Chanina):</span> It is an old Sela, an eighth of a standard Dinar. (Shitah Mekubetzes - R. Chanina is a Tana. He argues with our Mishnah.)</p></div>
<div class="indent1"><span class="nm">(f)</span><p><span class="cl">Version #2 - Tosfos - (R. Ami):</span> Five Sela'im equal a (gold) Dinar Aravi (worth 20 silver Dinarim);</p></div>
<div class="indent1"><span class="nm">(g)</span><p><span class="cl">(R. Chanina):</span> The Sela'im for Pidyon ha'Ben equal those of Syria, each Sela is an eighth of a Syrian gold Dinar.</p></div>
