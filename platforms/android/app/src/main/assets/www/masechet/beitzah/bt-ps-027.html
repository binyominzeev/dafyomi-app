<div class="subject"><span class="nm">1)</span><p>PERMITTING A <i>BECHOR</i> ON YOM TOV (cont.)</p></div>
<div class="indent1"><span class="nm">(a)</span><p>R. Ami declined to rule on the Bechor of R. Yehudah ha'Nasi (in accordance with R. Shimon).</p></div>
<div class="indent1"><span class="nm">(b)</span><p><span class="cl">Question (R. Zerika or R. Yirmeyah):</span> But in a dispute with R. Shimon the Halachah follows R. Yehudah!?</p></div>
<div class="indent1"><span class="nm">(c)</span><p>R. Yitzchak Nafcha similarly declined the animal.</p></div>
<div class="indent1"><span class="nm">(d)</span><p><span class="cl">Question (R. Yirmeyah or R. Zerika):</span> Same as b.</p></div>
<div class="indent1"><span class="nm">(e)</span><p><span class="cl">Answer (R. Aba):</span> Let the experts rule like R. Shimon!</p></div>
<div class="indent1"><span class="nm">(f)</span><p><span class="cl">Question:</span> On what basis do you say this?</p></div>
<div class="indent1"><span class="nm">(g)</span><p><span class="cl">Answer (R. Aba):</span> A tradition from R. Zeira that the Halachah here follows R. Shimon.</p></div>
<div class="indent1"><span class="nm">(h)</span><p><span class="cl">Question (A student who travelled to R. Zeira):</span> Did you rule like R. Shimon?</p></div>
<div class="indent1"><span class="nm">(i)</span><p><span class="cl">Answer:</span> No, I did not rule that way, it rather seems logical to me (since the position of R. Shimon not to rule on a Bechor is taught in a Beraisa as the position of Chachamim).</p></div>
<div class="indent1"><span class="nm">(j)</span><p><span class="cl">Question:</span> What is the Halachah?</p></div>
<div class="indent1"><span class="nm">(k)</span><p><span class="cl">Answer (R. Yosef):</span> The previous generations have indicated, by praising the position of R. Shimon b. Menasia as aligning with the view of R. Meir, that the Halachah follows R. Shimon.</p></div>
<div class="indent2"><span class="nm">1.</span><p>The elders appeared to be citing R. Shimon as ruling like R. Meir.</p></div>
<div class="indent2"><span class="nm">2.</span><p>This is unlikely since they were older than R. Shimon, rather, they were highlighting the similarity between R. Shimon's position regarding examining a Bechor and a position of R. Meir in his dispute with R. Yehudah.</p></div>
<div class="indent3"><span class="nm">i.</span><p><span class="cl">(R. Yehudah):</span> One who slaughters a Bechor and only thereafter shows it to an expert may, nevertheless, eat the blemished animal.</p></div>
<div class="indent3"><span class="nm">ii.</span><p><span class="cl">(R. Meir):</span> Since the animal was slaughtered without the benefit on an expert it is Asur.</p></div>
<div class="indent3"><span class="nm">iii.</span><p>This demonstrates that, according to R. Meir, examining a Bechor is more stringent than examining a regular Tereifah (which may be done after Shechitah).</p></div>
<div class="indent3"><span class="nm">iv.</span><p>By extension, this significance afforded the checking of a Bechor makes it prohibited as an act of Tikun on Yom Tov.</p></div>
<div class="indent1"><span class="nm">(l)</span><p><span class="cl">Question (Abaye):</span> The dispute between R. Meir and R. Yehudah is unrelated to examining Mumin, but rather is about penalizing one who acts against Chazal (by knowingly slaughtering a Bechor before its examination)!</p></div>
<div class="indent2"><span class="nm">1.</span><p>This may be demonstrated by the assertion of Rabah bar bar Chanah (citing R. Yochanan) that (R. Meir and R. Yehudah would concur to prohibit the animal which had blemishes which may change after the animal is slaughtered and) the dispute surrounds the issue of penalty (applying the prohibition over such changing blemishes to all cases).</p></div>
<div class="indent2"><span class="nm">2.</span><p><span class="cl">(R. Nachman b. Yitzchak):</span> The style used by R. Meir to assert the prohibition also indicates that the issue is a penalty.</p></div>
<div class="subject"><span class="nm">2)</span><p>EXAMINING THE MUM AND SUBSEQUENTLY INVESTIGATING IT</p></div>
<div class="indent1"><span class="nm">(a)</span><p>When people complained to R. Ami that Ami Vardena'ah refused to examine Bechoros on Yom Tov, R. Ami supported his refusal.</p></div>
<div class="indent1"><span class="nm">(b)</span><p><span class="cl">Question:</span> But R. Ami himself examined a Mum on Yom Tov!?</p></div>
<div class="indent1"><span class="nm">(c)</span><p><span class="cl">Answer:</span> He had already inspected the Mum before Yom Tov and he only investigated the matter on Yom Tov.</p></div>
<div class="bbbline">27b----------------------------------------27b</p></div>
<div class="indent1"><span class="nm">(d)</span><p>In the reported incident, Rava glanced at the animal during his Erev Yom Tov preparations and only interrogated the Kohen the next day.</p></div>
<div class="indent1"><span class="nm">(e)</span><p>Rava needed to preclude the possibility that the Kohen had indirectly (Gerama) precipitated the Mum by luring the animal into the fence which blemished his eye.</p></div>
<div class="indent1"><span class="nm">(f)</span><p><span class="cl">Question:</span> On what basis is Gerama prohibited?</p></div>
<div class="indent1"><span class="nm">(g)</span><p><span class="cl">Answer:</span> The Beraisa learns it from <i>Kol</i> Mum.</p></div>
<div class="subject"><span class="nm">3)</span><p>MISHNAH: THE MUKTZAH STATUS OF A CARCASS</p></div>
<div class="indent1"><span class="nm">(a)</span><p>A carcass may not be moved on Yom Tov.</p></div>
<div class="indent1"><span class="nm">(b)</span><p>In the incident where R. Tarfon both received and then asked this question, along with a question regarding moving a Chalah which became Tameh, the answer was that they are not to be moved.</p></div>
<div class="subject"><span class="nm">4)</span><p>OUR MISHNAH AND THE POSITION OF R. SHIMON</p></div>
<div class="indent1"><span class="nm">(a)</span><p><span class="cl">Question:</span> Our (Stam) Mishnah appears to oppose the position of R. Shimon (and supports R. Yehudah):</p></div>
<div class="indent2"><span class="nm">1.</span><p><span class="cl">(R. Shimon):</span> One may cut up a carcass for his dogs.</p></div>
<div class="indent2"><span class="nm">2.</span><p><span class="cl">(R. Yehudah):</span> Provided that it was a Neveilah before Shabbos, or it is Muktzah.</p></div>
<div class="indent1"><span class="nm">(b)</span><p><span class="cl">Answer:</span> R. Shimon could concur with our Mishnah if it speaks of a <i>healthy</i> animal dying on Shabbos.</p></div>
<div class="indent1"><span class="nm">(c)</span><p><span class="cl">Question:</span> But what of the opinions that R. Shimon maintains his Heter even when the animal was healthy!?</p></div>
<div class="indent1"><span class="nm">(d)</span><p><span class="cl">Answer:</span> Ze'iri interpreted our Mishnah as speaking of a Kodeshim animal (which could anyway not be given to his dogs).</p></div>
<div class="indent2"><span class="nm">1.</span><p>The Mishnah would agree with R. Shimon if the animal were Chulin.</p></div>
<div class="indent2"><span class="nm">2.</span><p>By coupling this question with Chalah which became Tameh, the Mishnah indicates that the subject matter is Kodeshim.</p></div>
<div class="indent1"><span class="nm">(e)</span><p><span class="cl">Question:</span> Then the Mishnah is a challenge to those who maintain that R. Shimon <i>prohibits</i> a healthy animal which dies on Shabbos!?</p></div>
<div class="indent1"><span class="nm">(f)</span><p><span class="cl">Answer:</span> The Mishnah is speaking of an endangered animal.</p></div>
<div class="subject"><span class="nm">5)</span><p>MISHNAH: TRANSACTIONS ON YOM TOV</p></div>
<div class="indent1"><span class="nm">(a)</span><p>A group of people should not join for the purpose of purchasing an animal on Yom Tov (Ein Nimnin).</p></div>
<div class="indent1"><span class="nm">(b)</span><p>They may join before Yom Tov, and the animal is slaughtered and apportioned on Yom Tov without.</p></div>
<div class="subject"><span class="nm">6)</span><p>EIN NIMNIN</p></div>
<div class="indent1"><span class="nm">(a)</span><p><span class="cl">Question:</span> What is meant by this expression?</p></div>
<div class="indent1"><span class="nm">(b)</span><p><span class="cl">Answer (R. Yehudah citing Shmuel):</span> One may not assign a value to an object on Yom Tov.</p></div>
<div class="indent1"><span class="nm">(c)</span><p><span class="cl">Question:</span> Then how can he collect its value tomorrow?</p></div>
<div class="indent1"><span class="nm">(d)</span><p><span class="cl">Answer (Rav):</span> By comparing the slaughtered animal to a remaining animal, and evaluating the remaining one at time of payment (as supported by the Beraisa which allows a purchase by referring to a portion to be bought, but without reference to money).</p></div>
