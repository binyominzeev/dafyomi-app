<p class="bas subject"><span class="nm">1)</span>EVALUATION OF PAIN (cont.)</p>
<p class="bas indent1"><span class="nm">(a)</span><span class="cl">(Mishnah):</span> We evaluate how much a person like this would want to receive...</p>
<p class="bas indent1"><span class="nm">(b)</span><span class="cl">Question:</span> How do we evaluate pain when there is also Nezek? (He already receives compensation for losing the limb)!</p>
<p class="bas indent1"><span class="nm">(c)</span><span class="cl">Answer (Shmuel's father):</span> We evaluate how much one like this would want to receive to have his leg or arm cut off.</p>
<p class="bas indent1"><span class="nm">(d)</span><span class="cl">Objection #1:</span> This is wrong. He would demand money equal to all five damages!</p>
<p class="bas indent1"><span class="nm">(e)</span><span class="cl">Objection #2:</span> A normal person would not agree to have his limb cut off for any sum of money!</p>
<p class="bas indent1"><span class="nm">(f)</span><span class="cl">Correction:</span> We evaluate how much one like this would want to receive to have his limb cut off if it was dangling (and useless).</p>
<p class="bas indent1"><span class="nm">(g)</span><span class="cl">Objection:</span> That is too much, for it also entails embarrassment (that his limb will be fed to dogs)!</p>
<p class="bas indent1"><span class="nm">(h)</span><span class="cl">Correction:</span> We imagine that the king had decreed that his limb must be cut off; we evaluate how much one would want to receive to have it cut off the way the damager did this, as opposed to through a potion (painlessly).</p>
<p class="bas indent1"><span class="nm">(i)</span><span class="cl">Objection:</span> A normal person would not agree to cause himself pain on condition to receive money!</p>
<p class="bas indent1"><span class="nm">(j)</span><span class="cl">Correction:</span> We imagine that the king had decreed that his limb must be cut off. We evaluate how much one would pay to have it cut off (painlessly) through a potion, as opposed to the way the damager cut it.</p>
<p class="bas indent1"><span class="nm">(k)</span><span class="cl">Question:</span> Shmuel's father said that we evaluate how much one like this would want to receive, not to pay!</p>
<p class="bas indent1"><span class="nm">(l)</span><span class="cl">Answer (Rav Huna brei d'Rav Yehoshua):</span> He means, the victim receives from the damager what a man would pay to the king (to have his limb cut off painlessly).</p>
<p class="bas subject"><span class="nm">2)</span>REFU'AH</p>
<p class="bas indent1"><span class="nm">(a)</span><span class="cl">(Mishnah):</span> Medical expenses: if Reuven hit Shimon, he must cure him...</p>
<p class="bas indent1"><span class="nm">(b)</span><span class="cl">(Beraisa):</span> If sores developed due to the blow and covered the wound, Reuven must heal him and pay for his Sheves due to the sores;</p>
<p class="bas indent1"><span class="nm">(c)</span>If the sores are not due to the blow, he is exempt from Refu'ah and from Sheves;</p>
<p class="bas indent1"><span class="nm">(d)</span>R. Yehudah says, even if they are due to the blow, he need only heal him. He is exempt from Sheves;</p>
<p class="bas indent1"><span class="nm">(e)</span>Chachamim say, the Torah equated Sheves and Refu'ah to teach that whoever is liable for Sheves is liable for Refu'ah, and whoever is exempt from Sheves is exempt from Refu'ah.</p>
<p class="bas indent1"><span class="nm">(f)</span><span class="cl">Question:</span> What do they argue about?</p>
<p class="bas indent1"><span class="nm">(g)</span><span class="cl">Answer #1 (Rabanan of Bei Rav):</span> They argue about whether Shimon may wrap up the wound (to avoid pain of the cold, and Reuven remains liable for sores that develop due to this).</p>
<p class="bas indent2"><span class="nm">1.</span>Chachamim say that he may wrap up the wound (i.e. he is entitled to do so, and Reuven remains fully liable);</p>
<p class="bas indent2"><span class="nm">2.</span>R. Yehudah says, he may wrap up the wound (if he wants that Reuven retain liability);</p>
<p class="bas indent3"><span class="nm">i.</span>(Even so, if he did so and sores developed,) Reuven must heal him. We learn from the double expression "v'Rapo Yerapei";</p>
<p class="bas indent3"><span class="nm">ii.</span>He is exempt from Sheves. The Torah did not repeat this.</p>
<p class="bas indent1"><span class="nm">(h)</span><span class="cl">Objection (Rabah):</span> If he may not wrap up the wound, Reuven is exempt even from Refu'ah!</p>
<p class="bas indent1"><span class="nm">(i)</span><span class="cl">Answer #2 (Rabah):</span> All agree that he is entitled to wrap up the wound, but not excessively.</p>
<p class="bas indent2"><span class="nm">1.</span>R. Yehudah says, since he may not wrap excessively, Reuven is liable only for Refu'ah (due to the double expression), but not for Sheves;</p>
<p class="bas indent2"><span class="nm">2.</span>Chachamim say, since the Torah obligates Reuven for Refu'ah, he is also liable for Sheves, for the Torah equates these.</p>
<p class="bas indent2"><span class="nm">3.</span>R. Yehudah says, the Torah explicitly exempted him from Sheves (in this case) - "just (he will give his Sheves)".</p>
<p class="bas indent2"><span class="nm">4.</span>Chachamim say that that discusses when the sores are not due to the wound.</p>
<p class="bas indent1"><span class="nm">(j)</span><span class="cl">Question:</span> According to the latter Chachamim (in the Seifa of the Beraisa), who equate Refu'ah  to Sheves, why did the Torah use a double expression of Refu'ah? (He is exempt even from Refu'ah!)</p>
<p class="bas indent1"><span class="nm">(k)</span><span class="cl">Answer:</span> It teaches like Tana d'Vei R. Yishmael;</p>
<p class="bas indent2"><span class="nm">1.</span><span class="cl">(Beraisa - Tana d'Vei R. Yishmael):</span> "V'Rapo Yerapei" teaches that doctors may heal.</p>
<p class="bas indent1"><span class="nm">(l)</span><span class="cl">(Beraisa) Question:</span> What is the source that if sores developed due to the blow and covered the wound, he must pay for Refu'ah and Sheves?</p>
<p class="bas indent1"><span class="nm">(m)</span><span class="cl">Answer:</span> "Just he will give his Sheves, and v'Rapo Yerapei".</p>
<p class="bas indent2"><span class="nm">1.</span><span class="cl">Suggestion:</span> Perhaps this applies even if the sores are not due to the blow!</p>
<p class="bas indent2"><span class="nm">2.</span><span class="cl">Rejection:</span> It says "just".</p>
<p class="bas indent1"><span class="nm">(n)</span>R. Yosi bar Yehudah says, "just" teaches that even if they are due to the blow, he is exempt.</p>
<p class="bas indent2"><span class="nm">1.</span><span class="cl">Version #1:</span> He is fully exempt, like the latter Chachamim.</p>
<p class="bas indent2"><span class="nm">2.</span><span class="cl">Version #2:</span> He is exempt from Sheves but liable for Refu'ah, like R. Yehudah says.</p>
<p class="bas indent1"><span class="nm">(o)</span><span class="cl">(Beraisa) Suggestion:</span> Perhaps this applies even if the sores are not due to the blow!</p>
<p class="bas indent1"><span class="nm">(p)</span><span class="cl">Rejection:</span> It says "just".</p>
<p class="bas indent1"><span class="nm">(q)</span><span class="cl">Question:</span> If the sores are not due to the blow, why do we need a verse to teach that he is exempt?!</p>
<p class="bas indent1"><span class="nm">(r)</span><span class="cl">Answer:</span> Not due to the blow' means as follows:</p>
<p class="bas indent2"><span class="nm">1.</span><span class="cl">(Beraisa) Suggestion:</span> If Shimon (the victim) disobeyed the doctor and ate honey and sweet things, which are bad for a wound, and dead skin arose on it, perhaps Reuven (the damager) must heal him!</p>
<p class="bas indent2"><span class="nm">2.</span><span class="cl">Rejection:</span> "Just" teaches that he is exempt.</p>
<p class="bas indent2"><span class="nm">3.</span>If Reuven says 'I will cure you', Shimon can say 'I fear you. I want someone else.'</p>
<p class="bas indent2"><span class="nm">4.</span>If Reuven says 'my relative will cure you for free', Shimon can say 'a proper doctor demands wages.'</p>
<p class="bas indent2"><span class="nm">5.</span>If Reuven says 'I will hire a doctor from afar for you', Shimon can say 'he will return home. Perhaps he will not take proper responsibility for my health".</p>
<p class="bas indent2"><span class="nm">6.</span>If Shimon says 'give me the wages of a doctor, I will heal myself', Reuven can say 'you will heal improperly, and this will result in larger medical expenses'.</p>
<p class="bas indent2"><span class="nm">7.</span>If Shimon says 'fix the amount to heal, and give this to me to heal myself' (and you will be exempt), Reuven can say 'you will be negligent, and people will think that I harmed you severely.'</p>
<p class="bas subject"><span class="nm">3)</span>THE OTHER PAYMENTS</p>
<p class="bas indent1"><span class="nm">(a)</span><span class="cl">(Beraisa):</span> All (other four damages) are paid even when Nezek is paid.</p>
<p class="bas indent1"><span class="nm">(b)</span><span class="cl">Question:</span> What is the source of this?</p>
<p class="bas indent1"><span class="nm">(c)</span><span class="cl">Answer #1 (Rav Zvid):</span> "A wound in place of a wound" obligates for pain even when Nezek is paid.</p>
<p class="bas indent1"><span class="nm">(d)</span><span class="cl">Question:</span> We need that verse to teach that one pays whether he damaged b'Mezid or b'Shogeg, whether he was forced or acted willingly!</p>
<p class="bas bbbline">85b----------------------------------------85b</p>
<p class="bas indent1"><span class="nm">(e)</span><span class="cl">Answer:</span> Had it came only for that, it should have said 'a wound for a wound.' It says "a wound in place of a wound" to teach both.</p>
<p class="bas indent1"><span class="nm">(f)</span><span class="cl">Answer #2 (Rav Papa):</span> "V'Rapo Yerapei" teaches that one pays for Refu'ah even when Nezek is paid.</p>
<p class="bas indent2"><span class="nm">1.</span><span class="cl">Question:</span> The verse teaches like Tana d'Vei R. Yishmael (to permit doctors to heal)!</p>
<p class="bas indent2"><span class="nm">2.</span><span class="cl">Answer:</span> To teach that, it would have said 'a doctor will heal'; rather, it says "v'Rapo Yerapei", to obligate for pain when Nezek is paid. (The Gemara connotes that the verse comes only for this. Zera Yitzchak explains that it teaches both of these.)</p>
<p class="bas indent2"><span class="nm">3.</span><span class="cl">Question:</span> We used the double expression above (to obligate for sores)!</p>
<p class="bas indent2"><span class="nm">4.</span><span class="cl">Answer:</span> Had the Torah doubled the same word twice, we would only lean as above. It used a different word to obligate for Refu'ah when Nezek is paid.</p>
<p class="bas indent1"><span class="nm">(g)</span><span class="cl">Question:</span> It follows that the other damages apply even when there is no Nezek. What is the case?</p>
<p class="bas indent1"><span class="nm">(h)</span><span class="cl">Answer:</span> Regarding pain, the Mishnah discusses one who burned him with a spit or nail, even on his fingernail, where no wound will result;</p>
<p class="bas indent2"><span class="nm">1.</span>Refu'ah - he had a wound that was healing, and a potent potion changed his skin to the color of Tzara'as, and another potion is needed to restore the color;</p>
<p class="bas indent2"><span class="nm">2.</span>Sheves - he took him to a room and locked him in;</p>
<p class="bas indent2"><span class="nm">3.</span>Embarrassment - he spit in his face.</p>
<p class="bas indent1"><span class="nm">(i)</span><span class="cl">(Mishnah):</span> To evaluate Sheves, we view what he would earn like one who guards gourds...</p>
<p class="bas indent1"><span class="nm">(j)</span><span class="cl">(Beraisa):</span> To evaluate Sheves, we view what he would earn like one who guards gourds;</p>
<p class="bas indent2"><span class="nm">1.</span><span class="cl">Question:</span> This is unfair! When he recovers, he will have a better job, such as drawing water or running errands!</p>
<p class="bas indent2"><span class="nm">2.</span>No, it is fair. When he recovers, he can only guard gourds (e.g. a limb was cut off). He already received compensation for the limb.</p>
<p class="bas indent1"><span class="nm">(k)</span><span class="cl">(Rava):</span> If Reuven cut off Shimon's hand, he pays for the hand. Regarding Sheves, we view Shimon like one who guards gourds;</p>
<p class="bas indent2"><span class="nm">1.</span>If he broke Shimon's leg, he pays for the leg. Regarding Sheves, we view Shimon like one who guards the door;</p>
<p class="bas indent2"><span class="nm">2.</span>If he blinded Shimon's eye, he pays for the eye. Regarding Sheves, we view Shimon like one who grinds;</p>
<p class="bas indent2"><span class="nm">3.</span>If he deafened Shimon, he pays Shimon's full value (for now he cannot work at all).</p>
<p class="bas indent1"><span class="nm">(l)</span><span class="cl">Question #1 (Rava):</span> If Reuven cut off Shimon's hand, broke his leg, blinded his eye, and deafened him, and no assessment of Shimon's value was made in between, what is the law?</p>
<p class="bas indent2"><span class="nm">1.</span>Does it suffice to make one assessment?</p>
<p class="bas indent2"><span class="nm">2.</span>Or, do we make a separate assessment for each damage?</p>
<p class="bas indent2"><span class="nm">3.</span><span class="cl">Question:</span> What difference does it make?</p>
<p class="bas indent2"><span class="nm">4.</span><span class="cl">Answer:</span> This determines whether or not he must pay the pain and embarrassment of each damage.</p>
<p class="bas indent3"><span class="nm">i.</span>Granted, he need not pay the Nezek, Refu'ah and Sheves of each. He pays for his full working value as if he killed him (and he pays all costs of Refu'ah until he is healed from everything);</p>
<p class="bas indent3"><span class="nm">ii.</span>However, there was pain and embarrassment from each damage. (Perhaps) he must pay each.</p>
<p class="bas indent1"><span class="nm">(m)</span><span class="cl">Question #2 (Rava):</span> If you will say that we make only one assessment, what if assessments of Shimon's value were made in between the damages?</p>
<p class="bas indent2"><span class="nm">1.</span>Since individual assessments were made, he must pay for each?</p>
<p class="bas indent2"><span class="nm">2.</span>Or, since he did not yet pay, he pays only once for all the damages?</p>
<p class="bas indent1"><span class="nm">(n)</span>This question is unsettled.</p>
<p class="bas subject"><span class="nm">4)</span>TEMPORARY DAMAGE</p>
<p class="bas indent1"><span class="nm">(a)</span><span class="cl">Question (Rabah):</span> If Reuven damaged Shimon, and later Shimon will return to full health, but because he cannot work now, he is worth less, what is the law?</p>
<p class="bas indent2"><span class="nm">1.</span><span class="cl">Question:</span> What is the case?</p>
<p class="bas indent2"><span class="nm">2.</span><span class="cl">Answer:</span> He hit him on the hand. It shriveled, and later it will return to normal.</p>
<p class="bas indent2"><span class="nm">3.</span>Since it will later return to normal, Reuven is exempt (from paying for the hand);</p>
<p class="bas indent2"><span class="nm">4.</span>Or, since Shimon is worth less now, perhaps Reuven is liable!</p>
<p class="bas normal"></p>
