<div class="indent1"><span class="nm">(a)</span><p>The Halachah is, one must cut the Kaneh below the place where the Kova starts to slope.</p></div>
<div class="indent2"><span class="nm">1.</span><p>This is like the opinion that leaving over in the Chiti is Kosher.</p></div>
<div class="indent1"><span class="nm">(b)</span><p>Rav Nachman permitted cutting the Kaneh below the place where the Kova starts to slope.</p></div>
<div class="indent1"><span class="nm">(c)</span><p><span class="cl">Question (Rav Chanan bar Rav Ketina):</span> This is not like Chachamim, nor like R. Yosi b'Rebbi Yehudah!</p></div>
<div class="indent1"><span class="nm">(d)</span><p><span class="cl">Answer (Rav Nachman):</span> I rely on what I heard;</p></div>
<div class="indent2"><span class="nm">1.</span><p><span class="cl">(R. Chiya bar Aba citing R. Yochanan):</span> Below the place where the Kova starts to slope is Kosher.</p></div>
<div class="indent1"><span class="nm">(e)</span><p><span class="cl">(R. Yehoshua ben Levi):</span> What Chachamim consider Hagramah is Kosher according to R. Yosi b'Rebbi Yehudah. What R. Yosi b'Rebbi Yehudah considers Hagramah is Kosher according to R. Chanina ben R. Antigonus.</p></div>
<div class="indent2"><span class="nm">1.</span><p><span class="cl">Question:</span> This is obvious (from our Mishnah and the Beraisa 18a-b)!</p></div>
<div class="indent2"><span class="nm">2.</span><p><span class="cl">Answer:</span> (R. Chanina ben Antignonus testified that Hagramah is valid.) One might have thought that this refers to the Hagramah of Chachamim. R. Yehoshua ben Levi teaches that he discusses and permits the Hagramah of R. Yosi b'Rebbi Yehudah (the first Tana).</p></div>
<div class="indent1"><span class="nm">(f)</span><p>The Halachah follows R. Chanina ben Antigonus, because Rav Nachman holds like him.</p></div>

<div class="indent2"><span class="nm">1.</span><p>Chachamim require the entire Shechitah in the ring. R. Yosi requires only the majority.</p></div>
<div class="indent1"><span class="nm">(b)</span><p>If the first third was Hagramah, and the last two thirds were slaughtered, all agree that this is invalid, for the Shechitah is completed when the majority is cut, and at that point, there was more Hagramah than Shechitah.</p></div>

<div class="indent2"><span class="nm">1.</span><p>R. Yosi is Machshir, just like when half the Kaneh was cut (not through Shechitah) before the Shechitah;</p></div>
