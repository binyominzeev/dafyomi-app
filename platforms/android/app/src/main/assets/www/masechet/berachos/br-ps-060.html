<p class="bas subject"><span class="nm">1)</span>A NEW HOUSE OR VESSELS</p>
<p class="bas indent1"><span class="nm">(a)</span><span class="cl">(Mishnah):</span> If one built a new house or bought new vessels...</p>
<p class="bas indent1"><span class="nm">(b)</span><span class="cl">Version #1 (Rav Huna):</span> This is only if he did not already have such a house or vessels -- if he did, he does not bless.</p>
<p class="bas indent1"><span class="nm">(c)</span><span class="cl">(R. Yochanan):</span> Even if he already had such things, he blesses.</p>
<p class="bas indent1"><span class="nm">(d)</span><span class="cl">Inference:</span> (R. Yochanan obligates only if he already had them without buying them (e.g. he inherited them).) All agree that if he buys more than once, he blesses only the first time!</p>
<p class="bas indent1"><span class="nm">(e)</span><span class="cl">Version #2 (Rav Huna):</span> This is only if he had not previously bought such things; if he had, he does not bless;</p>
<p class="bas indent1"><span class="nm">(f)</span><span class="cl">(R. Yochanan):</span> Even if he had already bought, he blesses.</p>
<p class="bas indent1"><span class="nm">(g)</span><span class="cl">Inference:</span> All agree that if he already had them without buying them, he blesses. (End of Version #2)</p>
<p class="bas indent1"><span class="nm">(h)</span><span class="cl">Question (Beraisa - R. Meir):</span> If one built a new house [or bought new vessels] unlike what he had before, he blesses;</p>
<p class="bas indent2"><span class="nm">1.</span>If he already had like them, he does not bless.</p>
<p class="bas indent2"><span class="nm">2.</span>R. Yehudah says, in both cases he must bless.</p>
<p class="bas indent2"><span class="nm">3.</span>We understand according to Version #1 -- Rav Huna holds like R. Meir, and R. Yochanan holds like R. Yehudah;</p>
<p class="bas indent2"><span class="nm">4.</span>But according to Version #2, Rav Huna is like R. Yehudah, but R. Yochanan is not like either Tana!</p>
<p class="bas indent1"><span class="nm">(i)</span><span class="cl">Answer:</span> R. Yochanan (according to Version #2) explains, R. Yehudah requires blessing even if he already bought before;</p>
<p class="bas indent2"><span class="nm">1.</span>The Tana'im argue about buying [for the first time] what he had before to teach the extremity of R. Meir, even then he exempts, all the more so when buying a second time.</p>
<p class="bas indent1"><span class="nm">(j)</span><span class="cl">Question:</span> Why didn't they argue about buying for the second time to teach the extremity of R. Yehudah?</p>
<p class="bas indent1"><span class="nm">(k)</span><span class="cl">Answer:</span> The Tana prefers to teach the extremity of the lenient opinion (R. Meir exempts from blessing. Eliyah Rabah (cited by Gilyon ha'Shas) - normally, it is a leniency to be allowed to bless -- Shehecheyanu is an exception, as the Isur of Berachah l'Vatalah does not apply to it).</p>
<p class="bas indent1"><span class="nm">(l)</span><span class="cl">(Mishnah):</span> One blesses [Dayan ha'Emes] on bad tidings [that include good].</p>
<p class="bas indent1"><span class="nm">(m)</span><span class="cl">Question:</span> What is such a case?</p>
<p class="bas indent1"><span class="nm">(n)</span><span class="cl">Answer:</span> His land was flooded -- even though it will deposit mud, which helps fertilize the field, now it is bad.</p>
<p class="bas indent1"><span class="nm">(o)</span><span class="cl">(Mishnah):</span> One blesses [ha'Tov veha'Metiv] on good tidings that include bad.</p>
<p class="bas indent1"><span class="nm">(p)</span><span class="cl">Question:</span> What is such a case?</p>
<p class="bas indent1"><span class="nm">(q)</span><span class="cl">Answer:</span> He found something;</p>
<p class="bas indent2"><span class="nm">1.</span>Even though it could be bad for him if the king will find found out and (Bartenura - punish him and) seize it, right now it is good.</p>
<p class="bas subject"><span class="nm">2)</span>PRAYER MUST BE FOR THE FUTURE</p>
<p class="bas indent1"><span class="nm">(a)</span><span class="cl">(Mishnah):</span> If one's wife is pregnant, it is a vain prayer to request that it will be a boy.</p>
<p class="bas indent1"><span class="nm">(b)</span>This teaches that prayer will not change it.</p>
<p class="bas indent1"><span class="nm">(c)</span><span class="cl">Question (Rav Yosef):</span> "<i>V'Achar</i> Yaldah Bas va'Tikra Es Shmah Dinah";</p>
<p class="bas indent2"><span class="nm">1.</span><span class="cl">Question:</span> What preceded this?</p>
<p class="bas indent2"><span class="nm">2.</span><span class="cl">Answer (Rav):</span> Leah knew that twelve sons would be born, she already had six [and was pregnant with a seventh boy] each of the Shefachos already had two -- she reasoned ("Danah"), "If I have a seventh son, Rachel will not even have as many as one of the Shefachos!</p>
<p class="bas indent2"><span class="nm">3.</span>The fetus was [miraculously] switched to a girl (Maharsha to Nidah 31a - at first, Yosef was inside Leah, and Rachel was pregnant with Dinah -- Hash-m switched the fetuses) -- "va'Tikra Es Shmah Dinah."</p>
<p class="bas indent1"><span class="nm">(d)</span><span class="cl">Answer #1:</span> We do not learn from miracles.</p>
<p class="bas indent1"><span class="nm">(e)</span><span class="cl">Answer #2:</span> Leah prayed for this within 40 days of conception.</p>
<p class="bas indent2"><span class="nm">1.</span><span class="cl">(Beraisa):</span> The first three days [after relations] one should pray that [the semen] will not decay; from day three until day 40, he should pray that it will be a male; from day 40 until three months, he should pray that it will not be a Sandal (squashed); from three months until six months, he should pray that it will not be a Nefel (stillborn); from six months until nine months, he should pray that it will be born safely.</p>
<p class="bas indent1"><span class="nm">(f)</span><span class="cl">Question:</span> Prayer will not influence the gender!</p>
<p class="bas indent2"><span class="nm">1.</span><span class="cl">(R. Yitzchak bar Ami):</span> "Ishah Ki Sazri'a v'Yaldah Zachar" -- if the man is Mazri'a (emits his seed) before the woman (and she becomes pregnant from this), the child will be a girl; if she is Mazra'as before him, a boy will be born.</p>
<p class="bas indent1"><span class="nm">(g)</span><span class="cl">Answer:</span> It can influence the gender if both were Mazri'a at the same time.</p>
<p class="bas indent1"><span class="nm">(h)</span><span class="cl">(Mishnah):</span> If one was traveling [and heard a scream]...</p>
<p class="bas indent1"><span class="nm">(i)</span><span class="cl">(Beraisa):</span> A case occurred, Hillel was traveling and heard a scream in the city; he said, "I am sure that it not from my house."</p>
<p class="bas indent2"><span class="nm">1.</span>"Mi'Shemu'ah Ra'ah Lo Yira Nachon Libo Batu'ach ba'Shem" applies to him.</p>
<p class="bas indent1"><span class="nm">(j)</span><span class="cl">(Rava):</span> Whichever way we expound this verse, it means the same:</p>
<p class="bas indent2"><span class="nm">1.</span>We can expound it from Reisha to Seifa -- he does not fear bad reports because he trusts firmly in Hash-m;</p>
<p class="bas indent2"><span class="nm">2.</span>We can expound from Seifa to Reisha -- one who trusts firmly in Hash-m will not fear bad reports.</p>
<p class="bas indent1"><span class="nm">(k)</span>A disciple was walking in back of R. Yishmael b'Rebbi Yosi in the market of Tziyon. R. Yishmael saw that the disciple was afraid. He said, "You transgress, 'Pachadu v'Tziyon Chata'im'."</p>
<p class="bas indent2"><span class="nm">1.</span><span class="cl">The Talmid:</span> But it says, "Ashrei Adam Mefached Tamid."</p>
<p class="bas indent2"><span class="nm">2.</span><span class="cl">R. Yishmael:</span> That refers to Divrei Torah (he fears that he will forget).</p>
<p class="bas indent1"><span class="nm">(l)</span>Yehudah bar Nasan was walking in back of Rav Hamnuna; Yehudah sighed.</p>
<p class="bas indent2"><span class="nm">1.</span><span class="cl">Rav Hamnuna:</span> You seek to bring afflictions upon yourself -- "Ki Fachad Pachadti va'Ye'esayeni va'Asher Yagorti Yavo Li"!</p>
<p class="bas indent2"><span class="nm">2.</span><span class="cl">Yehudah:</span> But it says, "Ashrei Adam Mefached Tamid"!</p>
<p class="bas indent2"><span class="nm">3.</span><span class="cl">Rav Hamnuna:</span> That refers to Divrei Torah.</p>
<p class="bas indent1"><span class="nm">(m)</span><span class="cl">(Mishnah):</span> [One says one prayer] when entering a big city... [Ben Azai says, he says two prayers when entering and two when leaving].</p>
<p class="bas indent1"><span class="nm">(n)</span><span class="cl">(Beraisa):</span> Before entering he says, "Yehi Ratzon (May it be Your will) to bring me in safely"; after entering he thanks Hash-m for bringing him in safely;</p>
<p class="bas indent2"><span class="nm">1.</span>Before leaving he says, "Yehi Ratzon to take me out safely"; after leaving he thanks Hash-m for bringing him out safely, and requests, "Just like You brought me out b'Shalom, may You lead me, support me and direct my steps b'Shalom; may You save me from all enemies and ambushers on the way."</p>
<p class="bas indent1"><span class="nm">(o)</span><span class="cl">Version #1 (Rav Masna):</span> This applies only to a city in which they kill without judgment, but in a city where they judge before killing, he does not pray (he just obeys the laws).</p>
<p class="bas indent1"><span class="nm">(p)</span><span class="cl">Version #2 (Rav Masna):</span> Even in a city in which they judge before killing, he says the prayer -- there is not always someone to advocate for him.</p>
<p class="bas subject"><span class="nm">3)</span>PRAYERS FOR THE BATHHOUSE AND BATHROOM</p>
<p class="bas indent1"><span class="nm">(a)</span><span class="cl">(Beraisa):</span> Before entering a bathhouse, one prays, "May You save me from this and all similar things, without mishap or sin; should I die, may my death atone for all my sins."</p>
<p class="bas indent1"><span class="nm">(b)</span><span class="cl">(Abaye):</span> One should not say this, it incites the Satan (by suggesting that a mishap might occur)!</p>
<p class="bas indent2"><span class="nm">1.</span><span class="cl">(Reish Lakish):</span> One should not incite the Satan!</p>
<p class="bas indent2"><span class="nm">2.</span><span class="cl">(Rav Yosef):</span> He learns from "Kim'at ki'Sedom Hayinu" -- after we equated ourselves to Sedom, the Navi responded, "Shim'u Davar Hash-m Ketzinei Sedom."</p>
<p class="bas indent1"><span class="nm">(c)</span><span class="cl">Question:</span> What does one say when leaving the bathhouse?</p>
<p class="bas indent1"><span class="nm">(d)</span><span class="cl">Answer (Rav Acha):</span> He thanks Hash-m for saving him from the fire.</p>
<p class="bas indent1"><span class="nm">(e)</span>R. Avahu went to the bathhouse; the floor (which was over the water) opened up under him. Miraculously he was on a pillar, and saved 101 people with him, holding one with his arm, who held another, who held another....</p>
<p class="bas indent1"><span class="nm">(f)</span><span class="cl">R. Avahu:</span> This is like Rav Acha taught -- one must thank Hash-m after leaving the bathhouse safely!</p>
<p class="bas indent1"><span class="nm">(g)</span><span class="cl">(Rav Acha):</span> One who goes to let blood prays, "May this be for a cure, may You heal me, for You are a faithful healer, Your cure is a true cure";</p>
<p class="bas indent2"><span class="nm">1.</span>It is improper for people to engage in medicine (rather, they should pray to Hash-m); however, they accustomed themselves to do so.</p>
<p class="bas indent1"><span class="nm">(h)</span><span class="cl">Objection (Abaye):</span> This is wrong!</p>
<p class="bas indent2"><span class="nm">1.</span><span class="cl">(Beraisa - Tana d'Vei R. Yishmael):</span> "V'Rapo Yerapei" permits doctors to heal.</p>
<p class="bas indent1"><span class="nm">(i)</span><span class="cl">Question:</span> What does one say when he recovers?</p>
<p class="bas indent1"><span class="nm">(j)</span><span class="cl">Answer (Rav Acha):</span> He blesses, "The One who heals for free (some texts - heals the sick)."</p>
<p class="bas bbbline">60b----------------------------------------60b</p>
<p class="bas indent1"><span class="nm">(k)</span>Before entering a bathroom one says [to the angels that accompany a person to guard him], "Honored servants of Hash-m, give honor to Hash-m and leave me until I enter, do my needs, and return to you."</p>
<p class="bas indent1"><span class="nm">(l)</span>(Mishnah Berurah (OC 3:1) -- our custom is not to say this, for we do not assume we are worthy to have angels accompanying us.)</p>
<p class="bas indent1"><span class="nm">(m)</span><span class="cl">(Abaye):</span> One should not say this, lest the angels abandon him!</p>
<p class="bas indent2"><span class="nm">1.</span>Rather, he says, "Guard me, guard me; help me, help me; support me, support me; wait for me, wait for me, until I enter and leave, for this is the way of people (we must go to the bathroom)."</p>
<p class="bas indent1"><span class="nm">(n)</span>After eliminating, one blesses, "Asher Yatzar... if one of the holes or ducts would be [improperly] opened or closed, one could not live [Gra - even for a moment]."</p>
<p class="bas indent1"><span class="nm">(o)</span><span class="cl">Question:</span> How does one end the Berachah?</p>
<p class="bas indent1"><span class="nm">(p)</span><span class="cl">Answer #1 (Rav):</span> "[Baruch Atah Hash-m] Rofei Cholim."</p>
<p class="bas indent1"><span class="nm">(q)</span><span class="cl">Objection (Shmuel):</span> This implies that all people are sick (for everyone must use the bathroom)!</p>
<p class="bas indent1"><span class="nm">(r)</span><span class="cl">Answer #2 (Shmuel):</span> Rather, he says, "[Baruch Atah Hash-m] Rofei Kol Basar."</p>
<p class="bas indent1"><span class="nm">(s)</span><span class="cl">Answer #3 (Rav Sheshes):</span> He says, "[Baruch Atah Hash-m] Mafli La'asos" (He does wonders).</p>
<p class="bas indent1"><span class="nm">(t)</span><span class="cl">(Rav Papa):</span> Therefore, we say both of them -- "Rofei Kol Basar u'Mafli La'asos."</p>
<p class="bas subject"><span class="nm">4)</span>DAILY BLESSINGS</p>
<p class="bas indent1"><span class="nm">(a)</span>One who goes to sleep says [the first paragraph of] Shema until "v'Hayah Im Shamo'a," and "Baruch ha'Mapil Chevlei Sheinah... Baruch Atah Hash-m ha'Me'ir la'Olam Kulo bi'Chvodo."</p>
<p class="bas indent1"><span class="nm">(b)</span>When he wakes up he says, "Elokai Neshamah she'Nasata Bi... Baruch Atah Hash-m ha'Machazir Neshamos li'Fegarim Mesim."</p>
<p class="bas indent1"><span class="nm">(c)</span>[The following blessings are recited after rising in the morning:]</p>
<p class="bas indent2"><span class="nm">1.</span>When one hears a rooster -- "He who gave understanding to roosters to distinguish between day and night";</p>
<p class="bas indent2"><span class="nm">2.</span>Upon opening his eyes -- "He who gives sight to the blind"; upon sitting up -- 'He who releases prisoners"; upon getting dressed -- "He who clothes the naked"; upon straightening up -- "He who straightens the crooked";</p>
<p class="bas indent2"><span class="nm">3.</span>Upon stepping on the ground -- 'He who stretches the land over the water"; upon walking -- "He who guides the steps of man"; upon putting on shoes -- "He who has provided all my needs"; upon tying his belt -- "He who girds Yisrael with strength"; upon putting a turban on his head -- "He who crowns Yisrael with glory."</p>
<p class="bas indent1"><span class="nm">(d)</span>When putting on Tzitzis, he blesses, "Asher Kidshanu b'Mitzvosav v'Tzivanu l'His'atef ba'Tzitzis";</p>
<p class="bas indent1"><span class="nm">(e)</span>When putting Tefilin on his arm he blesses, "Asher Kidshanu... l'Hani'ach Tefilin"; when putting Tefilin on his head he blesses, "Asher Kidshanu... Al Mitzvas Tefilin."</p>
<p class="bas indent1"><span class="nm">(f)</span>When washing his hands he blesses, "Asher Kidshanu... Al Netilas Yadayim";</p>
<p class="bas indent1"><span class="nm">(g)</span>When washing his face he blesses, "He Who removes pangs of sleep from my eyes... Who bestows good kindnesses to His nation Yisrael."</p>
<p class="bas indent1"><span class="nm">(h)</span><span class="cl">(Mishnah):</span> One blesses on bad tidings like one blesses on good tidings.</p>
<p class="bas indent1"><span class="nm">(i)</span><span class="cl">Question:</span> What does this mean?</p>
<p class="bas indent2"><span class="nm">1.</span><span class="cl">Suggestion:</span> We make the same blessing for bad as for good.</p>
<p class="bas indent2"><span class="nm">2.</span><span class="cl">Rejection (Mishnah):</span> On good tidings one says, "Baruch ha'Tov veha'Metiv"; on bad tidings, one says, "Baruch Dayan ha'Emes."</p>
<p class="bas indent1"><span class="nm">(j)</span><span class="cl">Answer (Rava):</span> This teaches that one must accept [and bless on] bad tidings with Simchah, just like for good tidings.</p>
<p class="bas indent1"><span class="nm">(k)</span><span class="cl">(Rav Acha):</span> We learn from "Chesed u'Mishpat Ashirah Lecha..." -- I will sing to You, whether You bestow Chesed or bring judgment upon me.</p>
<p class="bas indent1"><span class="nm">(l)</span><span class="cl">(R. Shmuel bar Nachmani):</span> We learn from "ba'Shem Ahalel Davar b'Elokim Ahalel Davar" -- I will praise Him whether He acts with His attribute of mercy or judgment.</p>
<p class="bas indent1"><span class="nm">(m)</span><span class="cl">(R. Tanchum):</span> We learn from "Kos Yeshu'os Esa uv'Shem Hash-m Ekra Tzara v'Yagon Emtza uv'Shem Hash-m Ekra."</p>
<p class="bas indent1"><span class="nm">(n)</span><span class="cl">(Rabanan):</span> We learn from "Hash-m Nasan va'Shem Lakach Yehi Shem Hash-m Mevorach."</p>
<p class="bas indent1"><span class="nm">(o)</span><span class="cl">(Rav Huna; also, R. Akiva):</span> One should accustom himself to say, "All that Hash-m does is for the good."</p>
<p class="bas indent2"><span class="nm">1.</span>R. Akiva was traveling; he came to a city, but no one would give him lodging for the night. He said, "All that Hash-m does is for the good." He went to spend the night in the wilderness.</p>
<p class="bas indent2"><span class="nm">2.</span>He had with him a rooster, donkey and lamp. A wind extinguished the lamp, a cat ate the rooster, and a lion ate the donkey. He said, "All that Hash-m does is for the good." That night, marauders came and attacked took the city captive.</p>
<p class="bas indent2"><span class="nm">3.</span><span class="cl">R. Akiva:</span> I told you, all that Hash-m does is for the good! (I was saved only because I did not find lodging, the lamp was extinguished, and the rooster and donkey were eaten -- otherwise, the troops would have found me.)</p>
<p class="bas indent1"><span class="nm">(p)</span><span class="cl">(Rav Huna):</span> A person should say few words in front of Hash-m (Maharsha - he should not pray excessively for relief from his afflictions, speak about them or question His ways) -- "Al Tevahel Al Picha v'Libcha Al Yemaher... Yiheyu Devarecha Me'atim."</p>
