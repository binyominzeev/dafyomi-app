<div class="indent2"><span class="nm">1.</span><p>The question is relevant to the position of Ben Zoma (is the obligation even for one outside).</p></div>
<div class="indent2"><span class="nm">2.</span><p>It is also relevant to the Rabanan who argue with R. Yehudah (do we exempt only one not doing an Avodah).</p></div>

<div class="indent1"><span class="nm">(d)</span><p><span class="cl">Question:</span> Still, the height must be a bit more than 23 Amos?</p></div>

<div class="indent1"><span class="nm">(b)</span><p><span class="cl">Answer:</span> To remind the Kohen Gadol that the day's Avodah is done in linen (as explained regarding the upcoming Mishnah).</p></div>
<div class="subject"><span class="nm">4)</span><p>MISHNAH: THE PROCEDURE OF THE TAMID</p></div>
<div class="indent1"><span class="nm">(a)</span><p>The Kohen Gadol disrobed, immersed, emerged and dried himself, after which he donned the Bigdei Zahav which were brought to him and he performed Kidush Yadayim and Raglayim.</p></div>
<div class="indent1"><span class="nm">(b)</span><p>He began the Shechitah of the Tamid, which another Kohen took over while the Kohen Gadol did Kabalas ha'Dam.</p></div>
<div class="indent1"><span class="nm">(c)</span><p>He went into the Heichal to offer the Ketores, prepare the Neiros, be Makriv the Rosh, Eivarim, Minchas Chavitin and Yayin.</p></div>

<div class="subject"><span class="nm">5)</span><p>R. MEIR AND THE RABANAN ON THE FIRST SET OF KIDUSHIN</p></div>
<div class="indent1"><span class="nm">(a)</span><p><span class="cl">Question:</span> Our Mishnah, which only lists one Kidush, must argue with R. Meir who holds that two Kidushin are required for donning the new set of Begadim.</p></div>
<div class="indent1"><span class="nm">(b)</span><p><span class="cl">Answer (R. Papa):</span> No, both the Rabanan and R. Meir agree that one Kidush is for disrobing and one is for donning; they only argue about the application of the Pasuk which connects disrobing to donning.</p></div>
<div class="indent1"><span class="nm">(c)</span><p><span class="cl">Question:</span> But the Beraisa teaches that, according to R. Meir, there were two Kidushin for the first Tevilah!?</p></div>
<div class="indent1"><span class="nm">(d)</span><p><span class="cl">Answer (R. Papa):</span> If it is explicit in the Beraisa, then it must be, indeed, that R. Meir argues with our Mishnah!</p></div>
