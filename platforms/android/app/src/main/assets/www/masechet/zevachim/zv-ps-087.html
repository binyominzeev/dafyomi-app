<div class="subject"><span class="nm">1)</span><p>WHEN IS MEAT ON THE <i>MIZBE'ACH</i> CONSIDERED <i>ME'UKAL</i>?</p></div>
<div class="indent1"><span class="nm">(a)</span><p><span class="cl">(Rabah):</span> If limbs came off (the Ma'arachah) before midnight and were returned after midnight, the following midnight is Ikul (considered final consumption, i.e. after this they need not be returned);</p></div>
<div class="indent1"><span class="nm">(b)</span><p><span class="cl">(Rav Chisda):</span> Dawn is Ikul.</p></div>
<div class="indent1"><span class="nm">(c)</span><p><span class="cl">(Bei Rav):</span> Rav Chisda learns from a Kal va'Chomer. Midnight does not disqualify due to Linah (Eimurim may be offered until dawn), yet it makes Ikul. Dawn disqualifies due to Linah, all the more so it makes Ikul!</p></div>
<div class="indent1"><span class="nm">(d)</span><p>If they came off before midnight and were returned after dawn, the following midnight is Ikul;</p></div>
<div class="indent1"><span class="nm">(e)</span><p><span class="cl">(Rav Chisda):</span> They will never have Ikul (until they become ashes).</p></div>
<div class="indent1"><span class="nm">(f)</span><p><span class="cl">Objection (Rav Yosef):</span> Why do they assume that midnight makes Ikul only for things on the Mizbe'ach? Perhaps it makes Ikul everywhere!</p></div>
<div class="indent1"><span class="nm">(g)</span><p><span class="cl">(Chachamim of Eretz Yisrael):</span> Rav Yosef is correct (it makes Ikul everywhere).</p></div>
<div class="indent1"><span class="nm">(h)</span><p><span class="cl">(R. Chiya bar Aba):</span> If they came off before midnight and were returned after midnight, one may not benefit from them, and there is no Me'ilah.</p></div>
<div class="indent1"><span class="nm">(i)</span><p><span class="cl">(Bar Kapara):</span> If they came off before midnight and were returned after midnight, there is no Me'ilah.</p></div>
<div class="indent1"><span class="nm">(j)</span><p><span class="cl">Question (Rav Papa):</span> Chachamim of Eretz Yisrael, R. Chiya bar Aba and Bar Kapara all agree with Rav Yosef. What do Rabah and Rav Chisda argue about? (Surely, also they agree with Rav Yosef!)</p></div>
<div class="indent1"><span class="nm">(k)</span><p><span class="cl">Answer (Abaye):</span> They argue about fatty limbs. (Even when they become hard, this is not Ikul, for the fat prevents them from becoming ashes.)</p></div>
<div class="subject"><span class="nm">2)</span><p><i>LINAH</i> ON TOP OF THE <i>MIZBE'ACH</i></p></div>
<div class="indent1"><span class="nm">(a)</span><p><span class="cl">Question (Rava):</span> Does Linah take effect on top of the Mizbe'ach?</p></div>
<div class="indent2"><span class="nm">1.</span><p><span class="cl">Question:</span> What is the case?</p></div>
<div class="indent3"><span class="nm">i.</span><p><span class="cl">Suggestion:</span> The limbs are still on top of the Mizbe'ach.</p></div>
<div class="indent3"><span class="nm">ii.</span><p><span class="cl">Rejection:</span> If regular Nosar, which was Lan on the floor of the Azarah, came on the Mizbe'ach, Lo Yered. All the more so, something that was Lan on the Mizbe'ach Lo Yered! (This would be obvious to Rava.)</p></div>
<div class="indent2"><span class="nm">2.</span><p><span class="cl">Answer:</span> The case is, after Linah on the Mizbe'ach, it came down.</p></div>
<div class="indent2"><span class="nm">3.</span><p>Perhaps we compare it to Linah on the Shulchan;</p></div>
<div class="indent3"><span class="nm">i.</span><p><span class="cl">(Mishnah):</span> Even if Lechem ha'Panim was on the Shulchan many days, we are not concerned.</p></div>
<div class="indent2"><span class="nm">4.</span><p>Or, perhaps we compare it to Linah on the ground.</p></div>
<div class="indent1"><span class="nm">(b)</span><p><span class="cl">Answer (Rabah):</span> Linah does not take effect on top of the Mizbe'ach.</p></div>
<div class="indent1"><span class="nm">(c)</span><p><span class="cl">Question:</span> Did Rava accept the answer?</p></div>
<div class="indent1"><span class="nm">(d)</span><p><span class="cl">Answer:</span> We learn from the following (that he did not):</p></div>
<div class="indent2"><span class="nm">1.</span><p>If limbs were Lan in the Azarah, they may be offered all night;</p></div>
<div class="indent2"><span class="nm">2.</span><p>If they were Lan on the Mizbe'ach, they may be offered at any time;</p></div>
<div class="indent2"><span class="nm">3.</span><p><span class="cl">(Rabah):</span> If they were brought down, Ya'alu;</p></div>
<div class="indent2"><span class="nm">4.</span><p><span class="cl">(Rava):</span> If they were brought down, Lo Ya'alu.</p></div>
<div class="subject"><span class="nm">3)</span><p>CAN <i>KLEI SHARES</i> BE <i>MEKADESH</i>?</p></div>
<div class="indent1"><span class="nm">(a)</span><p><span class="cl">(Mishnah):</span> Just like the Mizbe'ach is Mekadesh...</p></div>
<div class="indent1"><span class="nm">(b)</span><p><span class="cl">(Beraisa) Question:</span> "Kol ha'Noge'a ba'Mizbe'ach (Yikdash)" - only teaches that the Mizbe'ach is Mekadesh (what touches it). What is the source that the ramp is Mekadesh?</p></div>
<div class="indent2"><span class="nm">1.</span><p><span class="cl">Answer:</span> It says "Es ha'Mizbe'ach" (Shitah Mekubetzes - "El ha'Mizbe'ach Lo Ya'alu").</p></div>
<div class="indent1"><span class="nm">(c)</span><p><span class="cl">Version #1 - Rashi - Question (Reish Lakish):</span> Are Klei Shares Mekadesh Pesulim (so that they cannot be redeemed?)</p></div>
<div class="indent1"><span class="nm">(d)</span><p><span class="cl">Answer (R. Yochanan - Mishnah):</span> Just like the Mizbe'ach and ramp are Mekadesh what is fit for them, also Klei Shares.</p></div>
<div class="indent1"><span class="nm">(e)</span><p><span class="cl">Clarification of question (Reish Lakish):</span> I ask whether they are Mekadesh Pesulim to be offered l'Chatchilah.</p></div>
<div class="indent1"><span class="nm">(f)</span><p><span class="cl">Answer (R. Yochanan - Mishnah):</span> If Pesulim did Kabalah and Zerikah (was done, (ha'Eimurim) Lo Yerdu).</p></div>
<div class="bbbline">87b----------------------------------------87b</p></div>
<div class="indent2"><span class="nm">1.</span><p><span class="cl">Suggestion:</span> This means that Pesulim did both Kabalah and Zerikah. (However, if Kesherim did Zerikah, the Eimurim are offered l'Chatchilah, because the Kli Shares was Mekadesh the blood to be offered l'Chatchilah!)</p></div>
<div class="indent1"><span class="nm">(g)</span><p><span class="cl">Rejection:</span> No, it means that Pesulim did Kabalah <i>or</i> Zerikah.</p></div>
<div class="indent1"><span class="nm">(h)</span><p><span class="cl">Version #2 - Tosfos - Question (Reish Lakish):</span> If Pasul Kodshim are in a Kli Shares (on the Mizbe'ach), is this Mekadesh them? (Does Kedushas Mizbe'ach pass through the Kli?)</p></div>
<div class="indent1"><span class="nm">(i)</span><p><span class="cl">Answer (R. Yochanan - Mishnah):</span> Just like the Mizbe'ach and ramp Mekadesh what is fit for them, also Klei Shares.</p></div>
<div class="indent1"><span class="nm">(j)</span><p><span class="cl">Clarification of question (Reish Lakish):</span> I meant, are Klei Shares (<i>not</i> on the Mizbe'ach) Mekadesh Pesulim to be offered l'Chatchilah?

<div class="indent1"><span class="nm">(k)</span><p><span class="cl">Answer (R. Yochanan - Mishnah):</span> If Pesulim did Kabalah and Zerikah (was done, Lo Yered).</p></div>
<div class="indent2"><span class="nm">1.</span><p><span class="cl">Inference:</span> 'Zerikah was done' connotes b'Di'eved. L'Chatchilah, since Kabalah was Pasul, Zerikah should not have been done (even though the blood was in a Kli Shares)!</p></div>
<div class="indent1"><span class="nm">(l)</span><p><span class="cl">Rejection:</span> No, it means that was done by Pesulim Kabalah <i>or</i> Zerikah. (Then, the Eimurim Lo Yerdu. However, if Pesulim did Kabalah, we are Zorek l'Chatchilah, for the Kli is Mekadesh the blood). (end of Version #2)</p></div>
<div class="subject"><span class="nm">4)</span><p>AIRSPACE OF THE <i>MIZBE'ACH</i></p></div>
<div class="indent1"><span class="nm">(a)</span><p><span class="cl">Question:</span> Is the airspace above the Mizbe'ach like the Mizbe'ach (to be Mekadesh)?</p></div>
<div class="indent1"><span class="nm">(b)</span><p><span class="cl">Answer (Mishnah):</span> Just like the Mizbe'ach is Mekadesh, the ramp is Mekadesh;</p></div>
<div class="indent2"><span class="nm">1.</span><p>If the airspace is not like the Mizbe'ach, also the air above the ramp is not (Mekadesh like the) ramp. If so, Kidush of the ramp would never help, for once the Kodesh is lifted off the ramp, it has been taken down from the (Kedushah of) the Mizbe'ach;</p></div>
<div class="indent2"><span class="nm">2.</span><p>Once it was Yored, Lo Ya'aleh!</p></div>
<div class="indent1"><span class="nm">(c)</span><p><span class="cl">Rejection:</span> Really, the airspace is not like the Mizbe'ach. The case is, the Kodesh (e.g. a limb) was rolled up to the Mizbe'ach. It was never lifted off the ramp.</p></div>
<div class="indent1"><span class="nm">(d)</span><p><span class="cl">Question:</span> There is a gap between the ramp and the Mizbe'ach! (When it was over the gap, it left Kedushas Mizbe'ach.)</p></div>
<div class="indent1"><span class="nm">(e)</span><p><span class="cl">Answer:</span> (The limb is more than twice the length of the gap.) When the majority is over the ramp, it is as if it is totally over the ramp. When the majority is over the Mizbe'ach, it is as if it is totally over the Mizbe'ach.</p></div>
<div class="indent1"><span class="nm">(f)</span><p><span class="cl">Question:</span> (We do not consider the part of the limb in the gap by itself, rather, the entire limb has one law.) This should resolve the (unresolved) question of Rami bar Chama!</p></div>
<div class="indent2"><span class="nm">1.</span><p><span class="cl">Question (Rami bar Chama):</span> Are Olim (Kodshei Mizbe'ach) considered connected?</p></div>
<div class="indent1"><span class="nm">(g)</span><p><span class="cl">Answer:</span> Indeed, we could say that the airspace is not like the Mizbe'ach, and Olim are considered connected! (Rami never resolved his question, for he was unsure also about airspace of the Mizbe'ach.)</p></div>
<div class="indent1"><span class="nm">(h)</span><p><span class="cl">Objection (Rabah bar Rav Chanan):</span> Surely, the airspace is not like the Mizbe'ach. If it was, how would intent Chutz li'Zmano disqualify Olas ha'Of?!</p></div>
<div class="indent2"><span class="nm">1.</span><p>Since it is considered to be on the Mizbe'ach, even after Linah, Lo Yered;</p></div>
<div class="indent2"><span class="nm">2.</span><p>Since Haktarah is permitted at any time, intent for the next (or any other) day should not disqualify!</p></div>
<div class="indent1"><span class="nm">(i)</span><p><span class="cl">Answer (Rav Simi bar Ashi):</span> We can say that he intended to take it down the next day, and then burn it on the Mizbe'ach. (Once it was Yored, Lo Ya'aleh. It is forbidden to offer it.)</p></div>
<div class="indent1"><span class="nm">(j)</span><p><span class="cl">Question:</span> This is like Rava, who says that Linah applies on top of the Mizbe'ach;</p></div>
<div class="indent2"><span class="nm">1.</span><p>Rabah says that Linah does not apply on top of the Mizbe'ach, so also this is permitted. How can he answer?</p></div>
<div class="indent1"><span class="nm">(k)</span><p><span class="cl">Answer:</span> The case is, he intended to take it down before dawn and burn it the next day. (Linah applies, for it is not on the Mizbe'ach at dawn.)</p></div>
