<div class="subject"><span class="nm">1)</span><p>MOURNING ON SHABBOS (cont.)</p></div>
<div class="indent1"><span class="nm">(a)</span><p><span class="cl">Shmuel said to R. Yochanan:</span> Mourning is not observed (not even in private) on Shabbos.</p></div>
<div class="indent1"><span class="nm">(b)</span><p>Someone said in the name of Shmuel that a mourner who engages in marital relations (on Shabbos - Rashash) is deserving of the death penalty (by the hand of G-d - Rashi <b>MS</b>.), but R. Papa corrected the name from Shmuel to R. Yochanan (because, as above, Shmuel permitted it).</p></div>
<div class="indent1"><span class="nm">(c)</span><p><span class="cl">What Shmuel really said was:</span> A mourner who does not grow his hair or rip his clothes is deserving of death, as derived from the Torah.</p></div>
<div class="indent1"><span class="nm">(d)</span><p>Shmuel said some manifestations of mourning are forbidden on Shabbos and some are not. The forbidden ones are those which are unmistakable signs of mourning, namely:</p></div>
<div class="indent2"><span class="nm">1.</span><p>Wearing the mourning head-wrapping.</p></div>
<div class="indent2"><span class="nm">2.</span><p>Showing the rip in the garment.</p></div>
<div class="indent2"><span class="nm">3.</span><p>Keeping the beds turned over.</p></div>
<div class="indent1"><span class="nm">(e)</span><p>The manifestations of mourning that are permitted are those which are not such obvious signs of mourning (for sometimes ordinary people act in this way), namely:</p></div>
<div class="indent2"><span class="nm">1.</span><p>Going without shoes.</p></div>
<div class="indent2"><span class="nm">2.</span><p>Abstention from marital relations</p></div>
<div class="indent2"><span class="nm">3.</span><p>Refraining from washing in warm water (that was warmed before Shabbos, of course).</p></div>
<div class="indent1"><span class="nm">(f)</span><p>Rav disagreed with 4:j:1 (where Shmuel prohibited wearing the head-wrapping on Shabbos), because Rav required only a minimal head covering, and ordinary people often wear head coverings. Shmuel, however, said two things:</p></div>
<div class="indent2"><span class="nm">1.</span><p>Keri'ah must be done at the time of intense emotions, otherwise it is invalid.</p></div>
<div class="indent2"><span class="nm">2.</span><p>The head must be wrapped in the fashion of the Arabs, otherwise it is invalid. (This is why Shmuel forbade it on Shabbos; ordinary people (non-Arabs) never wear this kind of headdress.)</p></div>
<div class="indent3"><span class="nm">i.</span><p><span class="cl">(R. Nachman):</span> The wrapping must come around and cover the chin.</p></div>
<div class="indent1"><span class="nm">(g)</span><p><span class="cl">(R. Yochanan):</span> Removal of the mourner's head-wrapping for Shabbos is not required if he is wearing shoes; the shoes alone demonstrate that he is not observing mourning on Shabbos.</p></div>
<div class="subject"><span class="nm">2)</span><p>KERI'AH AT THE TIME OF INTENSE EMOTIONS</p></div>
<div class="indent1"><span class="nm">(a)</span><p><span class="cl">Question:</span> How could Shmuel say (above, 4:l:1) that Keri'ah must only be done at the time of intense emotion (i.e., at the time of death - Rashi)? Shmuel and R. Yochanan both did Keri'ah when they heard of the deaths of colleagues (some time after their deaths).</p></div>
<div class="indent1"><span class="nm">(b)</span><p><span class="cl">Answer:</span> Rabbis are different, because their words of Torah are constant reminders of how much they are missed. Therefore "the time of intense emotions" lasts much longer.</p></div>
<div class="indent1"><span class="nm">(c)</span><p><span class="cl">Question:</span> A Beraisa states that when a mourner changes clothes during Shiv'ah he must rip the new clothes also - and that is already after "the time of intense emotion."</p></div>
<div class="indent1"><span class="nm">(d)</span><p><span class="cl">Answer:</span> That Beraisa is dealing with mourning for a parent, and is an exception. It is not a bona fide Keri'ah, but an expression of honor for the parent.</p></div>
<div class="indent1"><span class="nm">(e)</span><p><span class="cl">Question:</span> May those rips (in the new change of clothing, mentioned in 1:c and 1:d) be sewn up (unlike the regular Keri'ah rip for a parent; see above 22b, 2:i)?</p></div>
<div class="indent1"><span class="nm">(f)</span><p><span class="cl">Answer:</span> There is a disagreement between Amora'im about this.</p></div>
<div class="indent1"><span class="nm">(g)</span><p>Going back to the topic of mourning on Shabbos:</p></div>
<div class="indent2"><span class="nm">1.</span><p><span class="cl">(Rava):</span> The mourner can wear his ripped garment on Shabbos around the house.</p></div>
<div class="indent2"><span class="nm">2.</span><p>R. Yosef held like R. Yochanan, that mourning is observed in private on Shabbos, so he wore his head-wrap on Shabbos (in the house).</p></div>
<div class="subject"><span class="nm">3)</span><p>SOME DETAILS ABOUT YOM TOV CANCELLING MOURNING</p></div>
<div class="indent1"><span class="nm">(a)</span><p><span class="cl">(R Gidel bar Menashia in the name of Shmuel):</span> The Halachah is like Raban Gamliel in the Mishnah (above, 19a, 2:d:2), that all Yamim Tovim are equal in their cancellation of Shiv'ah and Shloshim.</p></div>
<div class="indent1"><span class="nm">(b)</span><p>There is another version of R. Gidel bar Menashia's statement - that it was in the name of Rav, and that it was applied to a different Beraisa altogether, one dealing with burying young children. The Beraisa makes several points:</p></div>
<div class="indent2"><span class="nm">1.</span><p>A baby under 30 days old is carried out for burial in someone's arms (without a bier or coffin).</p></div>
<div class="indent2"><span class="nm">2.</span><p>The burial (in a secluded place) should not involve Yichud, i.e., one man and one woman, or one man and two women. (But Abba Shaul permits one man and two women in this case.)</p></div>
<div class="bbbline">24b----------------------------------------24b</p></div>
<div class="indent2"><span class="nm">3.</span><p>No Shurah is held for the infant, nor are there Birkas Aveilim or consolation calls.</p></div>
<div class="indent2"><span class="nm">4.</span><p>A baby over 30 days old is taken for burial in a coffin (R. Yehudah: not one carried on the shoulder, but in the arms).</p></div>
<div class="indent2"><span class="nm">5.</span><p>Shurah is held for the baby, as well as Birkas Aveilim and consolation calls.</p></div>
<div class="indent2"><span class="nm">6.</span><p>A baby over one year old is taken on a regular bier.</p></div>
<div class="indent2"><span class="nm">7.</span><p><span class="cl">R. Akiva disagrees:</span> To be put on a bier the baby has to be either actually two years old or developed like a two-year old.</p></div>
<div class="indent2"><span class="nm">8.</span><p><span class="cl">(R. Shimon Ben Elazar):</span> Whichever child is carried on a bier is to be grieved over by the public, and conversely.</p></div>
<div class="indent2"><span class="nm">9.</span><p><span class="cl">(R. Elazar Ben Azariah):</span> Whichever child was known to people in his lifetime is to be dealt with (by participating in his burial and in consoling the relatives - Rashi <b>MS</b>.) by the public, and conversely.</p></div>
<div class="indent2"><span class="nm">10.</span><p>The issue of how old a child should be to be given a eulogy has two opinions:</p></div>
<div class="indent3"><span class="nm">i.</span><p><span class="cl">(R. Meir in the name of R. Yishmael):</span> for poor children, three years old and up; for rich children, five years old and up.</p></div>
<div class="indent3"><span class="nm">ii.</span><p><span class="cl">(R. Yehudah in the name of R. Yishmael):</span> for poor children, five years and up; for rich children, six years and up. According to the second version of R. Gidel's statement (above, 2:b), he ruled like this position of R. Yehudah.</p></div>
<div class="indent1"><span class="nm">(c)</span><p>R. Anan bar Sason ruled that if a relative died the day before Shavuos, fourteen days of the Shloshim are taken off - seven for the Shiv'ah that is cancelled by Yom Tov (in accordance with Raban Gamliel, who considers Shavuos a regular Yom Tov in this respect), and seven for Shavuos, which is actually celebrated (with holiday sacrifices) for seven days.</p></div>
<div class="indent1"><span class="nm">(d)</span><p>R. Papa said the same thing about Rosh Hashanah (although there is no seven-day celebration connected to it) - it removes fourteen days from the Shloshim.</p></div>
<div class="indent1"><span class="nm">(e)</span><p>Ravina said the same thing about Shemini Atzeres - altogether twenty-one days are removed (seven for the cancelled Shiv'ah, seven for Sukkos and seven for Shemini Atzeres).</p></div>
<div class="subject"><span class="nm">4)</span><p>MISHNAH - RELATIVES ONLY</p></div>
<div class="indent1"><span class="nm">(a)</span><p>Keri'ah is done by relatives only, as is the baring of the shoulder and the eating of the first meal, served by others (henceforth: the mourner's meal).</p></div>
<div class="indent1"><span class="nm">(b)</span><p>During the mourner's meal the consolers should sit on upright beds.</p></div>
