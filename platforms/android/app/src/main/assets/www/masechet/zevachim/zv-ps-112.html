<div class="subject"><span class="nm">1)</span><p><i>HAKRAVAH</i> INSIDE AND OUTSIDE (cont.)</p></div>
<div class="indent1"><span class="nm">(a)</span><p><span class="cl">(Gemara) Question:</span> We understand when some blood was thrown outside and then some inside. He is liable, for all the blood is Kosher for Zerikah inside;</p></div>
<div class="indent2"><span class="nm">1.</span><p>However, when some was thrown inside and then some outside, why is he liable? After Zerikah inside, the remaining blood is Shirayim!</p></div>
<div class="indent1"><span class="nm">(b)</span><p><span class="cl">Answer:</span> Our Mishnah is R. Nechemyah, who obligates for Zerikah of Shirayim b'Chutz.</p></div>
<div class="indent1"><span class="nm">(c)</span><p><span class="cl">Question (Seifa):</span> If the blood was received in two buckets... if one was thrown inside and then the other outside, he is exempt.</p></div>
<div class="indent2"><span class="nm">1.</span><p>R. Nechemyah is Mechayev for Shirayim b'Chutz!</p></div>
<div class="indent1"><span class="nm">(d)</span><p><span class="cl">Answer:</span> The Mishnah is like Chachamim who argue with R. Elazar b'Rebbi Shimon. They say that Zerikah of one bucket makes the other Dachuy (Pasul).</p></div>
<div class="indent1"><span class="nm">(e)</span><p><span class="cl">(Mishnah):</span> This is similar to one who was Makdish his Chatas, lost it, was Makdish another, and then found the first...</p></div>
<div class="indent1"><span class="nm">(f)</span><p><span class="cl">Question:</span> Why do we need this clause?</p></div>
<div class="indent1"><span class="nm">(g)</span><p><span class="cl">Answer:</span> The Mishnah is like Rebbi, who says that if the first Chatas was lost at the time the second was Hukdash, whichever is not offered must die;</p></div>
<div class="indent2"><span class="nm">1.</span><p><span class="cl">Inference:</span> The Mishnah exempts (if he slaughtered one inside and then the other outside) only when one was lost, but if two animals were separated for Acharayus (in case one will become Pasul, the other will be the Chatas, it is as if he made one of them an Olah from the beginning (therefore, he is liable for offering the second outside).</p></div>
<div class="indent2"><span class="nm">2.</span><p>This is like Rav Huna.</p></div>
<div class="indent3"><span class="nm">i.</span><p><span class="cl">(Rav Huna):</span> If an Asham was Nitak to graze and was slaughtered without intent for any particular Korban, it is Kosher.</p></div>
<div class="indent1"><span class="nm">(h)</span><p><span class="cl">Objection:</span> This is not like Rav Huna's case. An Asham is a male. It itself is Kosher to be (offered for) an Olah;</p></div>
<div class="indent2"><span class="nm">1.</span><p>A Chatas is a female. It cannot be an Olah!</p></div>
<div class="indent1"><span class="nm">(i)</span><p><span class="cl">Answer (R. Chiya of Yostina):</span> The Mishnah discusses the Chatas of a Nasi, which is a male (goat).</p></div>
<div class="perekline"><p>PEREK PARAS CHATAS</p></div>
<div class="subject"><span class="nm">2)</span><p>LIABILITY FOR <i>SHECHUTEI CHUTZ</i></p></div>
<div class="indent1"><span class="nm">(a)</span><p><span class="cl">(Mishnah):</span> If one burned (Rashi's text - slaughtered) the Parah Adumah outside its pit (this will be explained), or offered the Se'ir ha'Mishtale'ach outside, he is exempt - "v'El Pesach Ohel Mo'ed Lo Hevi'o", one is exempt for anything not proper to be offered Pesach Ohel Mo'ed (in the Mikdash).</p></div>
<div class="indent1"><span class="nm">(b)</span><p>One is exempt for any of the following (if offered outside the Mikdash) - Rove'a or Nirva (an animal that had relations with a person), Muktzeh (an animal designated for idolatry), Ne'evad (one that was worshipped), Mechir (Kelev, i.e. an animal sold for a dog), Esnan (wages of a harlot), Kilayim (a crossbreed), Treifah, and Yotzei Dofen (an animal born through Caesarian section);</p></div>
<div class="indent2"><span class="nm">1.</span><p>"Lifnei Mishkan Hash-m" teaches that one is exempt for anything not proper for the Mishkan.</p></div>
<div class="indent1"><span class="nm">(c)</span><p>One is exempt for a Ba'al Mum, whether the Mum was permanent or temporary;</p></div>
<div class="bbbline">112b----------------------------------------112b</p></div>
<div class="indent1"><span class="nm">(d)</span><p>R. Shimon says, one is exempt for a permanent Mum. One transgresses a Lav for a temporary Mum.</p></div>
<div class="indent1"><span class="nm">(e)</span><p>One is exempt for Torim (turtledoves) too young to be offered and for Bnei Yonah (doves) too old to be offered;</p></div>
<div class="indent1"><span class="nm">(f)</span><p>R. Shimon says, one is exempt for Bnei Yonah that are too old, but one transgresses a Lav for Torim that are too young.</p></div>
<div class="indent1"><span class="nm">(g)</span><p>One is exempt for Oso v'Es Beno (an animal whose mother or child was slaughtered today) or Mechusar Zeman (an animal that may not be offered yet);</p></div>
<div class="indent1"><span class="nm">(h)</span><p>R. Shimon says, one transgresses a Lav for these. For anything Kosher to be offered later, one transgresses a Lav, but there is no Kares;</p></div>
<div class="indent1"><span class="nm">(i)</span><p>Chachamim say, whenever there is no Kares, one does not transgress the Lav.</p></div>
<div class="indent1"><span class="nm">(j)</span><p>'Mechusar Zeman' can apply to the Korban (it is too young to be offered, e.g. an animal less than eight days old), or the owner (he may not bring the Korban yet);</p></div>
<div class="indent2"><span class="nm">1.</span><p>Mechusar Zeman of the owner - if a Zav or Zavah (a man or woman who became Tamei due to emissions of uncooked semen or blood), Yoledes (one who gave birth) (or Metzora - Rashi deletes this from the Mishnah (based on 114b)) offered his (or her) Chatas or Asham (before waiting the necessary amount of days), he is exempt;</p></div>
<div class="indent2"><span class="nm">2.</span><p>If he offered his Olah or Shelamim, he is liable (for these may be brought for Nedavah).</p></div>
<div class="indent1"><span class="nm">(k)</span><p>One is exempt for offering any of the following (for they should be eaten, but not offered) - meat of a Chatas, Asham, (other) Kodshei Kodoshim (that are eaten, i.e. Shalmei Tzibur), and Kodshim Kalim;</p></div>
<div class="indent2"><span class="nm">1.</span><p>The remains of the Omer or of a Minchah (after Kemitzah), Shtei ha'Lechem, and Lechem ha'Panim.</p></div>
<div class="indent1"><span class="nm">(l)</span><p>One is exempt for the following Avodos outside the Mikdash - pouring oil (on a Minchah), breaking a Minchah into pieces, mixing (the flour with oil), salting, Tenufah (waving), Hagashah (bringing a Minchah near the Mizbe'ach), arranging the Lechem ha'Panim on the Shulchan, Dishun ha'Menorah (removing the used wick and remaining oil, and putting in a new wick and oil), Kemitzah, and Kabalah;</p></div>
<div class="indent1"><span class="nm">(m)</span><p>If any of the following people did one of these Avodos in the Mikdash, he is exempt - a Zar, Tamei, Mechusar Begadim, or one who was not Mekadesh (wash his hands and feet).</p></div>
<div class="subject"><span class="nm">3)</span><p>CHANGES IN THE <i>AVODAH</i></p></div>
<div class="indent1"><span class="nm">(a)</span><p><span class="cl">(Continuation of the Mishnah):</span> Before the Mishkan was erected, Bamos were permitted, and Avodah was done by the firstborns;</p></div>
<div class="indent1"><span class="nm">(b)</span><p>After the Mishkan was erected, Bamos were forbidden, and Avodah was done by Kohanim;</p></div>
<div class="indent2"><span class="nm">1.</span><p>Kodshei Kodoshim were eaten within the Kela'im (curtains around Chatzer ha'Mishkan). Kodshim Kalim were eaten within Machaneh Yisrael;</p></div>
<div class="indent1"><span class="nm">(c)</span><p>When the Mishkan was in Gilgal (during the conquest and division of Eretz Yisrael), Bamos were permitted. Kodshei Kodoshim were eaten within the Kela'im. Kodshim Kalim could be eaten anywhere;</p></div>
<div class="indent1"><span class="nm">(d)</span><p>When a Mikdash was built in Shilo, Bamos were forbidden;</p></div>
<div class="indent2"><span class="nm">1.</span><p>It was a stone building without a (solid) roof. It had only curtains on top. This was "Menuchah" ("Ki Lo Vasem Ad Atah El <i>ha'Menuchah</i> v'El ha'Nachalah");</p></div>
<div class="indent2"><span class="nm">2.</span><p>Kodshei Kodoshim were eaten within the Kela'im. Kodshim Kalim and Ma'aser Sheni could be eaten any place from where Shilo could be seen.</p></div>
<div class="indent1"><span class="nm">(e)</span><p>When the Mishkan was set up in Nov and (later in) Giv'on, Bamos were permitted. Kodshei Kodoshim were eaten within the Kela'im. Kodshim Kalim (Rashi's text - and Ma'aser Sheni) could be eaten in any city in Eretz Yisrael;</p></div>
<div class="indent1"><span class="nm">(f)</span><p>When the Beis ha'Mikdash was built in Yerushalayim, Bamos were forbidden forever. This was "Nachalah";</p></div>
<div class="indent2"><span class="nm">1.</span><p>Kodshei Kodoshim are eaten in the Azarah. (The Mishnah says 'Kela'im', for the Azarah corresponds to Chatzer ha'Mishkan which was within the Kela'im. Alternatively, when the Mikdash was being built, Kela'im delineated the extent of the Azarah.) Kodshim Kalim and Ma'aser Sheni are eaten within the walls (of Yerushalayim).</p></div>
<div class="indent1"><span class="nm">(g)</span><p>If a Korban was Hukdash at a time when Bamos were forbidden and one offered it (outside) when Bamos were forbidden, he transgresses an Aseh and a Lav, and he is Chayav Kares;</p></div>
<div class="indent1"><span class="nm">(h)</span><p>If it was Hukdash when Bamos were permitted and offered when Bamos were forbidden, he transgresses an Aseh and a Lav, but there is no Kares;</p></div>
<div class="indent1"><span class="nm">(i)</span><p>If it was Hukdash when Bamos were forbidden and offered when Bamos were permitted, he transgresses only an Aseh.</p></div>
<div class="indent1"><span class="nm">(j)</span><p>The following Korbanos must be offered in the Mishkan - a Korban Hukdash to be offered in the Mishkan (even if Bamos are permitted, e.g. when the Mishkan was in Gilgal) and Korbanos Tzibur;</p></div>
<div class="indent1"><span class="nm">(k)</span><p>A Korban Yachid may be offered on a Bamah;</p></div>
<div class="indent2"><span class="nm">1.</span><p>If one specified to offer a Korban Yachid in the Mishkan, he must do so;</p></div>
<div class="indent2"><span class="nm">2.</span><p>If he offered it on a Bamah, he is exempt.</p></div>
