<p class="bas subject"><span class="nm">1)</span>CONCERN FOR BLEMISHES</p>
<p class="bas indent1"><span class="nm">(a)</span>Ben Bag Bag argues, because blemishes do not invalidate a sale of a slave;</p>
<p class="bas indent2"><span class="nm">1.</span>A blemish in an exposed area cannot invalidate the sale. The buyer saw it and accepted it!</p>
<p class="bas indent2"><span class="nm">2.</span>One does not care about blemishes on covered parts. One buys a slave for work!</p>
<p class="bas indent2"><span class="nm">3.</span>If the slave is a thief or dice-player (Tosfos; Rashi - kidnapper), the sale stands. It is known that most slaves are like that!</p>
<p class="bas indent2"><span class="nm">4.</span>If the slave is an armed robber, or was sentenced to be killed by the king, such things become known. (Rashi - the buyer surely knew and accepted this; Tosfos - such slaves are rarely bought. We would not decree for an uncommon case.)</p>
<p class="bas indent1"><span class="nm">(b)</span><span class="cl">Question:</span> Whether we are concerned for a blemish, or for feeding Terumah to siblings, an Arusah Bas Yisrael does not eat Terumah. In what cases does it matter which is the reason?</p>
<p class="bas indent1"><span class="nm">(c)</span><span class="cl">Answer #1:</span> The husband accepted the Kidushin even if she has blemishes (we are concerned for feeding siblings);</p>
<p class="bas indent1"><span class="nm">(d)</span><span class="cl">Version #1 (Rashi) Answers #2 and 3:</span> The father sent her with messengers of the husband, or the father's messengers accompanied her with messengers of the husband (there is concern only for blemishes).</p>
<p class="bas indent1"><span class="nm">(e)</span><span class="cl">Version #2 (Tosfos) Answer #2:</span> The father accompanied her with messengers of the husband (there is concern only for blemishes).</p>
<p class="bas subject"><span class="nm">2)</span>HOW MUCH MONEY IS NEEDED FOR KIDUSHIN?</p>
<p class="bas indent1"><span class="nm">(a)</span><span class="cl">(Mishnah):</span> Beis Shamai says, a Dinar...</p>
<p class="bas indent1"><span class="nm">(b)</span><span class="cl">Question:</span> What is Beis Shamai's reason?</p>
<p class="bas indent1"><span class="nm">(c)</span><span class="cl">Answer #1 (R. Zeira):</span> A woman does not agree to be Mekudeshes for less than this.</p>
<p class="bas indent2"><span class="nm">1.</span><span class="cl">Objection (Abaye):</span> Very rich girls expect a fortune for Kidushin. If such a girl accepted a Dinar for Kidushin, would it be invalid?!</p>
<p class="bas indent2"><span class="nm">2.</span><span class="cl">Answer (R. Zeira):</span> I agree that if she accepts, she is Mekudeshes;</p>
<p class="bas indent3"><span class="nm">i.</span>My law applies when he was Mekadesh her at night (she could not see how much he gave) or if she made a Shali'ach to accept Kidushin (she did not specify how much must be given).</p>
<p class="bas indent1"><span class="nm">(d)</span><span class="cl">Answer #2 (Rav Yosef):</span> Beis Shamai hold like Rav Yehudah, that whenever the Torah says "Kesef", it refers to coins of Tzuri (pure silver. Rashi - once we know that a Perutah (a copper coin, the smallest unit of currency) is not enough, we require a significant amount, i.e. a Dinar. Tosfos - the smallest Tzuri coin is a Dinar.)</p>
<p class="bas subject"><span class="nm">3)</span>THE KESEF OF THE TORAH</p>
<p class="bas indent1"><span class="nm">(a)</span><span class="cl">(Rav Yehudah):</span> Whenever the Torah says "Kesef", it refers to coins of Tzuri (pure silver). Whenever Chachamim mention Kesef, they refer to standard coins (one eighth silver, and the rest copper).</p>
<p class="bas indent1"><span class="nm">(b)</span><span class="cl">Objection:</span> This is not always true!</p>
<p class="bas bbbline">11b----------------------------------------11b</p>
<p class="bas indent1"><span class="nm">(c)</span><span class="cl">Question #1:</span> Regarding Modeh b'Miktzas (one who admits to part of a claim must swear), the claim is "Kesef Oh Kelim",</p>
<p class="bas indent2"><span class="nm">1.</span><span class="cl">(Mishnah):</span> The oath applies only if the claim is at least two Ma'os, and the admission is at least a Perutah. (Rashi - according to Rav Yehudah, a claim of one Ma'ah, the smallest silver coin of Tzuri, should suffice! Tosfos - according to Rav Yehudah, we should require a claim of a Dinar!)</p>
<p class="bas indent1"><span class="nm">(d)</span><span class="cl">Answer:</span> The Torah equates Kesef and Kelim. If the claim is Kelim, it must be at least two. The same applies to a claim of Kesef;</p>
<p class="bas indent2"><span class="nm">1.</span>Also, just like Kesef is esteemed, also the Kelim must be esteemed (Rashi; Tosfos - also, just like Kelim are important, also the Kesef referred to is (the smallest amount that is) important, i.e. a Ma'ah).</p>
<p class="bas indent1"><span class="nm">(e)</span><span class="cl">Question #2:</span> The Torah says that Ma'aser Sheni may be redeemed on "ha'Kesef";</p>
<p class="bas indent2"><span class="nm">1.</span><span class="cl">(Mishnah):</span> One who wants to exchange his (copper Perutos on which he redeemed) Ma'aser Sheni...</p>
<p class="bas indent1"><span class="nm">(f)</span><span class="cl">Answer:</span> The 'Hei' in "ha'Kesef" teaches that other coins are also valid for redemption.</p>
<p class="bas indent1"><span class="nm">(g)</span><span class="cl">Question #3:</span> Regarding Hekdesh, it says "he will give ha'Kesef", "it will be established (redeemed) for him";</p>
<p class="bas indent2"><span class="nm">1.</span><span class="cl">(Shmuel):</span> If (even) an enormous value of Hekdesh was redeemed on a Perutah, the redemption is valid.</p>
<p class="bas indent1"><span class="nm">(h)</span><span class="cl">Answer:</span> We learn from a Gezeirah Shavah "Kesef-Kesef" from Ma'aser Sheni.</p>
<p class="bas indent1"><span class="nm">(i)</span><span class="cl">Question #4:</span> Regarding Kidushin, it says "when a man will take a woman", and we learn from a Gezeirah Shavah from the purchase of Efron's field that Kesef may be used;</p>
<p class="bas indent2"><span class="nm">1.</span>Beis Hillel say that a Perutah can Mekadesh.</p>
<p class="bas indent2"><span class="nm">2.</span><span class="cl">(Summation of question):</span> Does Rav Yehudah hold like Beis Shamai?!</p>
<p class="bas indent1"><span class="nm">(j)</span><span class="cl">Answer:</span> Rav Yehudah teaches as follows. Whenever the Torah specifies a quantity of "Kesef", it refers to coins of Tzuri (pure silver). Whenever Chachamim mention Kesef, they refer to standard coins (which are one eighth silver).</p>
<p class="bas indent1"><span class="nm">(k)</span><span class="cl">Question:</span> We already learn this from a Mishnah!</p>
<p class="bas indent2"><span class="nm">1.</span><span class="cl">(Mishnah):</span> The following are in Shekel ha'Kodesh, which is one twenty-fifth of a Maneh Tzuri: five Sela'im for Pidyon ha'Ben, 30 Shekalim paid for a slave gored by an animal, 50 Shekalim paid by one who raped or enticed a virgin Na'arah, and 100 Shekalim paid by one who falsely claims that his Kalah was not a virgin.</p>
<p class="bas indent1"><span class="nm">(l)</span><span class="cl">Answer:</span> Primarily, Rav Yehudah came to teach the Seifa;</p>
<p class="bas indent2"><span class="nm">1.</span>A Mishnah says that one who was Toke'a (blew (with his mouth, or a Shofar) in a person's ear (or hit him near the ear) pays a Sela (without specifying). Rav Yehudah teaches that this is a standard Sela, i.e. half a Dinar.</p>
<p class="bas subject"><span class="nm">4)</span>ANOTHER EXPLANATION OF BEIS SHAMMAI</p>
<p class="bas indent1"><span class="nm">(a)</span><span class="cl">Answer #3 (to question 2:b - Reish Lakish):</span> Beis Shamai learn like Chizkiyah;</p>
<p class="bas indent2"><span class="nm">1.</span><span class="cl">(Chizkiyah):</span> "And she was redeemed" teaches that the redemption price of an Amah Ivriyah is reduced (based on how long she has worked).</p>
<p class="bas indent2"><span class="nm">2.</span><span class="cl">Question:</span> Granted, if she was bought for a Dinar, the redemption can be reduced until a Perutah;</p>
<p class="bas indent3"><span class="nm">i.</span>But if she was bought for a Perutah, the redemption cannot be reduced!</p>
<p class="bas indent3"><span class="nm">ii.</span><span class="cl">Suggestion:</span> Perhaps really she can be bought for a Perutah. The Torah teaches that when she is bought for more, the redemption can be reduced.</p>
<p class="bas indent3"><span class="nm">iii.</span><span class="cl">Rejection:</span> This cannot be, for redemption is like Yi'ud (the master or his son marries her). If Reuven buys an Amah with whom he cannot do Yi'ud, the sale is invalid. Likewise, if he buys her in a way that her redemption cannot be reduced (i.e. she was bought for a Perutah), the sale is invalid!</p>
