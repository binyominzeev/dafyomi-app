<p class="dedicationbox">TEMURAH 9 (1 Adar) - dedicated in memory of Mordecai (Marcus) ben Elimelech Shmuel Kornfeld, who perished in the Holocaust along with most of his family. His Yahrzeit is observed on 1 Adar. May his death and the deaths of the other Kedoshim of the Holocaust atone for the sins of Klal Yisrael like Korbanos. </p>

<p class="bas indent1"><span class="nm">(a)</span><span class="cl">(Mishnah):</span> Temurah takes effect in the following cases. (Rashi - "A" on "B" means that he tries to transfer the Kedushah of "B", the initial Hekdesh, onto "A", the Nitfas; this is like Abaye (below). Our text of Tosfos, and the Gemara and Rashi in Bechoros (14b) explain oppositely. Shitah Mekubetzes changes all of them to conform with Rashi here);</p>

<p class="bas indent1"><span class="nm">(d)</span><span class="cl">Answer (Beraisa):</span> "Behemah bi'Vehemah" teaches that Temurah takes effect on Tzon on Bakar (cattle), sheep on goats, males on females, a Tam on a Ba'al Mum, and vice-versa of all of these.</p>
<p class="bas indent2"><span class="nm">1.</span><span class="cl">Suggestion:</span> Perhaps it applies even if the initial Hekdesh was blemished before it was Hukdash!</p>

<p class="bas indent1"><span class="nm">(e)</span><span class="cl">Question:</span> How do we learn this from the verse?</p>
<p class="bas indent1"><span class="nm">(f)</span><span class="cl">Answer #1 (Abaye):</span> It could have said "... Tov b'Ra Oh Ra Bo"; it repeats "b'Tov" to teach that the initial Hekdesh must be good (Tam) from the beginning.</p>
<p class="bas indent1"><span class="nm">(g)</span><span class="cl">Answer #2 (Rava):</span> Both occurrences of "Tov" are extra. It could have said "Lo Yachalifenu v'Lo Yamir Oso b'Ra Oh Ra Bo";b  v</p>
<p class="bas indent2"><span class="nm">1.</span>One "Tov" teaches that one is lashed even for Tam b'Tam. The other teaches like Abaye.</p>
<p class="bas indent1"><span class="nm">(h)</span>Abaye does not require a verse to teach Rava's first law, he learns it from a Kal va'Chomer:</p>
<p class="bas indent2"><span class="nm">1.</span>One is lashed for Tov b'Ra, even though he tried to transfer the Kedushah onto a better animal. All the more so he is lashed for Tov b'Tov!</p>
<p class="bas indent2"><span class="nm">2.</span>Rava disagrees, for we do not punish due to a Kal va'Chomer!</p>
<p class="bas indent2"><span class="nm">3.</span>Abaye says that the Kal va'Chomer merely shows that Tov b'Ra forbids also when the initial Hekdesh is Tam.</p>
<p class="bas indent1"><span class="nm">(i)</span><span class="cl">(Beraisa):</span> "Lo Yachalifenu" (do not make Temurah) with another person's animal. "V'Lo Yamir Oso" with your own animal.</p>
<p class="bas indent1"><span class="nm">(j)</span><span class="cl">Question:</span> It would have sufficed to say "Lo Yachalifenu", and all the more so it is forbidden with  one's own animal!</p>
<p class="bas indent1"><span class="nm">(k)</span><span class="cl">Version #1 - Answer:</span> Had it said only "Lo Yachalifenu", we would have thought that one is lashed for Temurah with another's animal, for then the Korban becomes Chulin and the Nitfas becomes Hekdesh, but when one makes Temurah with his own animal, in the end both animals are Kodesh, he is not lashed. The verse teaches that this is not so.</p>
<p class="bas indent1"><span class="nm">(l)</span><span class="cl">Version #2 (Shitah Mekubetzes) Answer:</span> Had it said only "Lo Yachalifenu", we would have thought that one is lashed only if he intended that the Korban become Chulin, but if he intended that it remain Hekdesh, and to be Mekadesh another animal through Temurah, he is exempt. The verse teaches that this is not so. (end of Version #2)</p>
<p class="bas indent1"><span class="nm">(m)</span><span class="cl">Question:</span> What is the case of making Temurah on another person's animal?</p>
<p class="bas indent2"><span class="nm">1.</span><span class="cl">Suggestion:</span> Reuven tries to transfer the Kedushah of his Korban onto Shimon's Chulin animal.</p>
<p class="bas indent2"><span class="nm">2.</span><span class="cl">Rejection:</span> One cannot be Mekadesh another person's property. "Ish Ki Yakdish Beiso Kodesh" teaches that one can be Makdish only things like his house, which are in his Reshus.</p>
<p class="bas indent1"><span class="nm">(n)</span><span class="cl">Answer:</span> Rather, he tries to transfer the Kedushah of Shimon's Korban onto his own Chulin animal.</p>
<p class="bas indent1"><span class="nm">(o)</span><span class="cl">Objection:</span> Temurah does not take effect in this case!</p>

<p class="bas indent1"><span class="nm">(a)</span><span class="cl">(Mishnah):</span> One can make Temurah in the following ways:</p>

<p class="bas indent2"><span class="nm">1.</span><span class="cl">Version #1 (Rashi):</span> Just like the initial Hekdesh is only one, also the Temurah (Nitfas).</p>

<p class="bas indent1"><span class="nm">(d)</span><span class="cl">Answer (Beraisa):</span> "Behemah bi'Vehemah" teaches that one can be Memir two animals Tachas one, one Tachas two, 100 Tachas one, or one Tachas 100.</p>
<p class="bas indent2"><span class="nm">1.</span>R. Shimon says, Temurah is only one Tachas one, for it says "Behemah bi'Vehemah", not "Behemah bi'Vehemos" or "Behemos bi'Vhemah".</p>

Shimon agrees that one can make Temurah more than once on the same Kodesh animal (just not at the same time). He learns this from "Behemah bi'Vehemah", (Temurah works only one at a time.) (end of Version #2)</p>
<p class="bas indent1"><span class="nm">(k)</span><span class="cl">(R. Yochanan):</span> R. Shimon holds that just like one cannot be Memir two animals on one, one cannot make Temurah more than once on one animal.</p>

(Acharonim - this must be according to the opinion that an Asham is Nitak to an Olas <i>Yachid</i>, for Korbanos Tzibur do not make Temurah. Mar'eh Kohen amends Rashi's text to say so.)</p>
