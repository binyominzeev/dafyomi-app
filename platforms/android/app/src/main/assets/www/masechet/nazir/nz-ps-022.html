<p class="bas subject"><span class="nm">1)</span>HOW DOES <i>HAFARAH</i> WORK? (cont.)</p>
<p class="bas indent1"><span class="nm">(a)</span><span class="cl">Answer #4 (Beraisa):</span> If a woman accepted Nezirus and became Teme'ah, and later her husband annulled her Nezirus, she brings Chatas ha'Of (a bird), but not Olas ha'Of.</p>
<p class="bas indent2"><span class="nm">1.</span>If a husband cuts off a vow, she should also bring Olas ha'Of!</p>
<p class="bas indent1"><span class="nm">(b)</span><span class="cl">Objection:</span> If he uproots it, she should also be exempt from Chatas ha'Of!</p>
<p class="bas indent1"><span class="nm">(c)</span><span class="cl">Resolution:</span> (Really, he uproots.) The Beraisa is like R. Elazar ha'Kapar:</p>
<p class="bas indent2"><span class="nm">1.</span><span class="cl">(Beraisa - R. Elazar ha'Kapar) Question:</span> "He sinned on the soul" - against which soul did he sin?</p>
<p class="bas indent2"><span class="nm">2.</span><span class="cl">Answer:</span> (He sinned against his own soul.) He pained himself by abstaining from wine; for this he is called a sinner. (The Chatas is for this, even though she was never truly a Nezirah.)</p>
<p class="bas indent2"><span class="nm">3.</span>One who pains himself by abstaining from only one thing is called a sinner, and all the more so, one who fasts and denies himself all food!</p>
<p class="bas indent1"><span class="nm">(d)</span><span class="cl">Answer #5 (Beraisa):</span> If Leah accepted to be a Nezirah and Rachel said 'and I', and Leah's husband annulled her vow, Leah is not a Nezirah, but Rachel is.</p>
<p class="bas indent2"><span class="nm">1.</span>This proves that he cuts off a vow. (This is like Chachamim. We proved above that R. Elazar Hakapar holds that he uproots. Alternatively, perhaps all agree that he cuts, and "V'Hezir... and he will bring" teaches that one brings Olas ha'Of only if he must still observe Nezirus - Rosh).</p>
<p class="bas indent1"><span class="nm">(e)</span><span class="cl">(Continuation of Beraisa - R. Shimon):</span> If Rachel said 'I am like you', when Leah's Nezirus is annulled, Rachel's is also. (R. Shimon can agree that Hafarah cuts. Rachel intended to be forbidden only when Leah is forbidden.)</p>

<p class="bas subject"><span class="nm">2)</span>DOES <i>HATFASAH</i> APPLY TO THE BEGINNING, OR TO THE END?</p>
<p class="bas indent1"><span class="nm">(a)</span><span class="cl">(Mar Zutra, son of Rav Mari):</span> From Chachamim (who say that Rachel remains a Nezirah after Leah's Nezirus is annulled) we can resolve Rami bar Chama's question:</p>
<p class="bas indent2"><span class="nm">1.</span><span class="cl">Question (Rami bar Chama):</span> If one said 'this is forbidden to me like meat of Shelamim', what is the law?</p>
<p class="bas indent3"><span class="nm">i.</span>Is a person Matfis in the original Kedushah (i.e. before Zerikah (throwing the Korban's blood on the Mizbe'ach), when the meat was forbidden to all)?</p>
<p class="bas indent3"><span class="nm">ii.</span>Or, is he Matfis in the final Kedushah (i.e. after Zerikah, when the meat is permitted?</p>
<p class="bas indent2"><span class="nm">2.</span><span class="cl">(Understood Answer:</span> Chachamim forbid Rachel because one is Matfis in the original Kedushah.)</p>
<p class="bas indent1"><span class="nm">(b)</span><span class="cl">Version #1 - Objection:</span> Our case is unlike Rami's case!</p>
<p class="bas indent2"><span class="nm">1.</span>There, even though the meat is permitted after Zerikah, it may not be eaten outside the Mikdash! (It still has some Kedushah. Perhaps one is Matfis in the final Kedushah!)</p>
<p class="bas indent2"><span class="nm">2.</span>Here, Rachel cannot intend to be Matfis in the final Kedushah. After Hafarah, Leah is not a Nezirah at all!</p>
<p class="bas indent1"><span class="nm">(c)</span><span class="cl">Version #2:</span> Indeed, from Chachamim we can resolve Rami's question.</p>
<p class="bas indent1"><span class="nm">(d)</span><span class="cl">Question:</span> If Leah accepted Nezirus, and Rachel said 'I am a Nezirah in your footsteps', what is the law?</p>
<p class="bas indent2"><span class="nm">1.</span>Does Rachel intend to always have the same status as Leah, and if Leah's Nezirus is annulled, Rachel will also be permitted?</p>
<p class="bas indent2"><span class="nm">2.</span>Or, does she intend to follow in Leah's path before Hafarah (but Rachel will remain forbidden)?</p>
<p class="bas indent1"><span class="nm">(e)</span><span class="cl">Answer (Mishnah):</span> If Leah said 'I am a Nezirah', and her husband said 'and I', he cannot annul her Nezirus.</p>
<p class="bas indent2"><span class="nm">1.</span>If one intends to be Matfis before Hafarah, he would be able to annul her Nezirus, and he would still be a Nazir!</p>
<p class="bas indent2"><span class="nm">2.</span><span class="cl">Conclusion:</span> We must say that he wants to always have her status. Therefore, he cannot annul her Nezirus (for this would permit his own Nezirus).</p>
<p class="bas indent3"><span class="nm">i.</span>If someone else was Matfis in her Nezirus, he would become permitted after Hafarah.</p>
<p class="bas indent1"><span class="nm">(f)</span><span class="cl">Rejection:</span> Really, a person is Matfis before Hafarah;</p>
<p class="bas indent2"><span class="nm">1.</span>Her husband cannot annul her Nezirus, because saying 'and I', is like Kiyum;</p>
<p class="bas indent2"><span class="nm">2.</span>If he regrets his Kiyum, and a Chacham permits the Kiyum, he may then annul his wife's Nezirus. If not, he cannot annul it.</p>
<p class="bas subject"><span class="nm">3)</span>ONE WHO PROMPTED HIS WIFE TO BE <i>MATFIS</i> IN HIS <i>NEZIRUS</i></p>
<p class="bas indent1"><span class="nm">(a)</span><span class="cl">(Mishnah):</span> If Reuven said to his wife 'I am a Nazir, and you?', and she answered 'Amen', he can annul her Nezirus, and he is still a Nazir.</p>
<p class="bas indent1"><span class="nm">(b)</span><span class="cl">Contradiction (Beraisa):</span> If Reuven said to his wife 'I am a Nazir, and you?', and she answered 'Amen', they are both Nezirim. If not, neither is a Nazir, because he made his Nezirus contingent on hers.</p>
<p class="bas indent1"><span class="nm">(c)</span><span class="cl">Answer #1 (Rav Yehudah):</span> Correct the Beraisa to say 'he can annul her Nezirus, and he is still a Nazir' (like the Mishnah. Rosh - the Seifa teaches that his Nezirus is contingent on her acceptance, but it does not depend on her continuing to be a Nezirah.)</p>
<p class="bas indent1"><span class="nm">(d)</span><span class="cl">Answer #2 (Abaye):</span> We need not alter the Beraisa. The case is, he said 'I am a Nazir, and you?', i.e. do you want that we will be Nezirim? (Ha made his Nezirus dependent on hers.)</p>
<p class="bas indent2"><span class="nm">1.</span>In the Mishnah he said 'I am a Nazir. And (what about) you?' (Do you also want to be a Nezirah</p>
<p class="bas indent2"><span class="nm">2.</span>Therefore, he can annul her Nezirus, and his Nezirus stands.</p>
