<p class="bas subject"><span class="nm">1)</span><i>PARIM</i> THAT WERE BROUGHT FOR IDOLATRY</p>
<p class="bas indent1"><span class="nm">(a)</span><span class="cl">(Beraisa - R. Shimon) Question:</span> Why does it say "you will take a second Par for a Chatas"? We already know that one is an Olah, and one is a Chatas!</p>
<p class="bas indent1"><span class="nm">(b)</span><span class="cl">Answer:</span> One might have thought that the Chatas (is like a regular Chatas, which) may be eaten by the (Maharsha - Kohanim, who are called) Levi'im. "A second Par" teaches that it is like the Olah, which is not eaten.</p>
<p class="bas indent1"><span class="nm">(c)</span>R. Yosi says, similarly, "those who returned from exile (in Bavel) offered Olos... 12 Parim... all were Olos."</p>
<p class="bas indent1"><span class="nm">(d)</span><span class="cl">Question:</span> This very verse says "12 goats (were) Chata'os"!</p>
<p class="bas indent1"><span class="nm">(e)</span><span class="cl">Answer:</span> Rather, just like Olos are not eaten, also these Chata'os.</p>
<p class="bas indent1"><span class="nm">(f)</span><span class="cl">(Beraisa - R. Yehudah):</span> The Korbanos were brought for idolatry.</p>
<p class="bas indent1"><span class="nm">(g)</span><span class="cl">(Rav Yehudah):</span> The idolatry was done in the days of Tzidkiyahu (at the end of the first Mikdash).</p>
<p class="bas indent1"><span class="nm">(h)</span><span class="cl">Question:</span> According to R. Yehudah, we understand why there were 12 Se'irim. The 12 Shevatim sinned, or the majority. The other Shevatim brought due to the sinners.</p>
<p class="bas indent2"><span class="nm">1.</span>We can also explain according to R. Shimon. Eleven Shevatim sinned, and Beis Din brought one.</p>
<p class="bas indent2"><span class="nm">2.</span>However, according to R. Meir, only Beis Din brings. Why were 12 brought?</p>
<p class="bas indent1"><span class="nm">(i)</span><span class="cl">Answer #1:</span> They sinned 12 times (due to 12 mistaken rulings of Beis Din).</p>
<p class="bas indent1"><span class="nm">(j)</span><span class="cl">Question:</span> The sinners died. How could a later generation bring the Korbanos!</p>
<p class="bas indent1"><span class="nm">(k)</span><span class="cl">Answer #1 (Rav Papa):</span> Regarding an individual's Chatas, if the owner died, the Chatas must die. This does not apply to a Tzibur.</p>
<p class="bas indent2"><span class="nm">1.</span><span class="cl">Question:</span> What is the reason (that we do not say that the Chatas of a Tzibur must die)?</p>
<p class="bas indent3"><span class="nm">i.</span><span class="cl">Suggestion:</span> "Your children will be in place of your fathers."</p>
<p class="bas indent3"><span class="nm">ii.</span><span class="cl">Rejection:</span> If so, this should apply even to an individual!</p>
<p class="bas indent2"><span class="nm">2.</span><span class="cl">Answer #1:</span> We learn from the Chata'os of Rosh Chodesh;</p>
<p class="bas indent3"><span class="nm">i.</span>The Torah says that we buy them from Terumas ha'Lishkah (half-Shekels given by the Tzibur), even though some of the donors died!</p>
<p class="bas indent3"><span class="nm">ii.</span><span class="cl">Inference:</span> We may bring a Chatas Tzibur even if the owners died.</p>
<p class="bas indent2"><span class="nm">3.</span><span class="cl">Objection:</span> There, we are not sure that the owners died. The returning exiles knew that the sinners died!</p>
<p class="bas indent2"><span class="nm">4.</span><span class="cl">Answer #2:</span> "Atone for Your nation Yisrael that You redeemed, Hash-m" - Eglah Arufah (a calf beheaded when a murdered corpse is found) is worthy to atone for those that Hash-m redeemed from Mitzrayim.</p>
<p class="bas indent2"><span class="nm">5.</span><span class="cl">Objection:</span> There, the calf is beheaded primarily to atone for the living. It atones also for the dead;</p>
<p class="bas indent3"><span class="nm">i.</span>Here, it was not an atonement for the living!</p>
<p class="bas indent1"><span class="nm">(l)</span><span class="cl">Answer #2:</span> Indeed, some of the sinners were alive - "many of the Kohanim... (who saw the first Mikdash)..."</p>
<p class="bas indent2"><span class="nm">1.</span><span class="cl">Question:</span> Perhaps they were the minority (Rashi - of those who returned from exile; Tosfos ha'Rosh - of those who sinned in Bayis Rishon)!</p>
<p class="bas indent2"><span class="nm">2.</span><span class="cl">Rejection:</span> "The joyful sounds of the trumpets could not be heard, due to the crying (of those who had seen Bayis Rishon, i.e. they were the majority)."</p>
<p class="bas indent1"><span class="nm">(m)</span><span class="cl">Objection:</span> The idolatry was b'Mezid. Why were Korbanos brought for it?!</p>
<p class="bas indent1"><span class="nm">(n)</span><span class="cl">Answer:</span> This was a special ruling (Hash-m decreed this time, they could atone for what was done b'Mezid. This is also another answer to Questions (h) and (j) - Tosfos.)</p>
<p class="bas indent1"><span class="nm">(o)</span><span class="cl">Support - Question:</span> Why did they bring "96 rams, 77 lambs"?</p>
<p class="bas indent1"><span class="nm">(p)</span><span class="cl">Answer:</span> We must say that it was a special decree of Hash-m to bring them. Similarly, it was a special decree to bring the Chata'os.</p>
<p class="bas subject"><span class="nm">2)</span>A <i>CHATAS</i> OF THE <i>TZIBUR</i></p>
<p class="bas indent1"><span class="nm">(a)</span><span class="cl">(Beraisa):</span> (If Beis Din ruled mistakenly, and most of Yisrael sinned,) if one of the Tzibur died, they still bring the Par. If one of the Beis Din died, they do not bring it.</p>
<p class="bas indent1"><span class="nm">(b)</span><span class="cl">Question:</span> Who is the Tana of the Beraisa?</p>
<p class="bas indent1"><span class="nm">(c)</span><span class="cl">Answer (Rav Chisda):</span> It is R. Meir, who says that Beis Din brings the Par, and not the Tzibur;</p>
<p class="bas indent2"><span class="nm">1.</span>If one of the Tzibur died, they bring it, since the Beis Din is still alive;</p>
<p class="bas indent2"><span class="nm">2.</span>If one of the Beis Din died, they are exempt. This is like when one of the partners in a Chatas dies (we leave the Chatas to die. <span class="note"><span class="notewd">Note:</span> individuals cannot bring a Chatas together. We refer to a Chatas of the Tzibur, or the Par that atones for the Kohanim on Yom Kipur.)</span></p>
<p class="bas indent1"><span class="nm">(d)</span><span class="cl">Question (Rav Yosef):</span> We can establish the Beraisa like R. Shimon, who says that Beis Din <i>and</i> the Tzibur bring Parim!</p>
<p class="bas indent2"><span class="nm">1.</span>If one of the Tzibur died, they bring the Par, since death of the Tzibur does not mandate that its Chatas die;</p>
<p class="bas indent2"><span class="nm">2.</span>If one of the Beis Din died, they are exempt. This is like when one of the partners in a Chatas dies.</p>
<p class="bas indent1"><span class="nm">(e)</span><span class="cl">Objection (Abaye):</span> It cannot be R. Shimon. He holds that there is no case when the Chatas of partners must die!</p>
<p class="bas indent2"><span class="nm">1.</span><span class="cl">(Beraisa - R. Yehudah):</span> If the Par and Sa'ir (that atone for the Kohanim and Tzibur, respectively) of Yom Kipur were lost, and others were offered in their place, and the first animals were found, they must die;</p>
<p class="bas indent2"><span class="nm">2.</span>R. Shimon says, they graze (until they become blemished. We sell them and buy Olos Nedavah of the Tzibur with the money.) The Chatas of a Tzibur (i.e. Kohanim; they are partners in it) need never be left to die.</p>
<p class="bas indent1"><span class="nm">(f)</span><span class="cl">Answer (Rav Yosef):</span> Kohanim are not regular partners. The Torah equated their law to that of the Kahal - "he will atone for the Kohanim and all ha'Kahal."</p>
<p class="bas bbbline">6b----------------------------------------6b</p>
<p class="bas indent1"><span class="nm">(g)</span><span class="cl">Question:</span> If so, Kohanim should bring a Par (like any other Shevet) if they sin through following a mistaken Hora'ah!</p>
<p class="bas indent2"><span class="nm">1.</span><span class="cl">Suggestion:</span> Perhaps they do!</p>
<p class="bas indent2"><span class="nm">2.</span><span class="cl">Rejection:</span> If so, there would be 13 Parim for the Shevatim! (The Tana'im who obligate every Shevet obligate only 12 for the Shevatim.)</p>
<p class="bas indent1"><span class="nm">(h)</span><span class="cl">Answer (Rav Acha b'Rebbi Yakov):</span> Shevet Levi (which includes the Kohanim) does not bring because it is not considered a Kahal - "I will make you a Kahal... (an inheritance)" - whoever does not have an inheritance is not considered a Kahal.</p>
<p class="bas indent1"><span class="nm">(i)</span><span class="cl">Question:</span> If so, only 11 Shevatim bring!</p>
<p class="bas indent1"><span class="nm">(j)</span><span class="cl">Answer #1 (Abaye):</span> "Efrayim and Menasheh will be like Reuven and Shimon (two Shevatim)."</p>
<p class="bas indent1"><span class="nm">(k)</span><span class="cl">Objection (Rava):</span> "They will be (like Reuven and Shimon)... in their inheritance" (each received a full share of Eretz Yisrael), but not for anything else!</p>
<p class="bas indent2"><span class="nm">1.</span><span class="cl">Question:</span> They are like two Shevatim regarding the Degalim (encampment in the Midbar)!</p>
<p class="bas indent2"><span class="nm">2.</span><span class="cl">Answer:</span> That was only to honor the Degalim.</p>
<p class="bas indent2"><span class="nm">3.</span><span class="cl">Question:</span> Each has its own Nasi (leader), like two Shevatim!</p>
<p class="bas indent2"><span class="nm">4.</span><span class="cl">Answer:</span> That was only to honor the Nesi'im.</p>
<p class="bas indent3"><span class="nm">i.</span><span class="cl">(Beraisa) Question:</span> Shlomo inaugurated the Beis ha'Mikdash for seven days. Why did Moshe inaugurate the Mishkan for 12 days?</p>
<p class="bas indent3"><span class="nm">ii.</span><span class="cl">Answer:</span> This was to honor the Nesi'im (so each could offer Korbanos on a separate day).</p>
<p class="bas indent1"><span class="nm">(l)</span><span class="cl">Question:</span> Is Abaye's answer valid?</p>
<p class="bas indent1"><span class="nm">(m)</span><span class="cl">Answer (Beraisa - R. Shimon):</span> In five cases, a Chatas must die:</p>
<p class="bas indent2"><span class="nm">1.</span>It gave birth (the child has Kedushas Chatas, and it must die);</p>
<p class="bas indent2"><span class="nm">2.</span>Temuras Chatas (Reuven said, this animal should be in place of my Chatas. Also the new animal gets Kedushas Chatas, and it must die);</p>
<p class="bas indent2"><span class="nm">3.</span>Its owner died;</p>
<p class="bas indent2"><span class="nm">4.</span>The owner (lost the Chatas and) offered another in its place (and then found the original animal);</p>
<p class="bas indent2"><span class="nm">5.</span>The animal was not offered within its first year (so it is disqualified).</p>
<p class="bas indent2"><span class="nm">6.</span>The first three cases never apply to the Tzibur:</p>
<p class="bas indent3"><span class="nm">i.</span>The Tzibur never brings female animals;</p>
<p class="bas indent3"><span class="nm">ii.</span>Temurah does not apply to Korbanos Tzibur;</p>
<p class="bas indent3"><span class="nm">iii.</span>Death of the Tzibur does not mandate that its Chatas die.</p>
<p class="bas indent2"><span class="nm">7.</span><span class="cl">Suggestion:</span> Perhaps in cases 4 and 5 (another was offered in its place, or if it was not offered within its first year) a Chatas of the Tzibur must die. We have no source to say otherwise!</p>
<p class="bas indent2"><span class="nm">8.</span><span class="cl">Rejection:</span> We learn the unknown from the explicit. The law of the child or Temurah of a Chatas, or a Chatas whose owner died (in all three cases, it must die) applies only to individuals;</p>
<p class="bas indent3"><span class="nm">i.</span>Also the law of a Chatas whose owner offered another in its place, or that was not offered within one year (that it must die) applies only to individuals!</p>
<p class="bas indent2"><span class="nm">9.</span><span class="cl">Question:</span> How can we learn these two cases, which can occur, from the first three cases, which never occur?!</p>
<p class="bas indent2"><span class="nm">10.</span><span class="cl">Answer:</span> R. Shimon had a tradition from Sinai that four Chata'os must die. (The fifth may graze until it gets a blemish, it is redeemed, and the money is used to bring Olos. It was forgotten which grazes, so we leave all five to die.) All four apply (only) in one common setting.</p>
<p class="bas indent3"><span class="nm">i.</span>The tradition cannot apply to a Tzibur, so it must apply to an individual.</p>
<p class="perekline">PEREK HOREH KOHEN MASHI'ACH</p>
<p class="bas subject"><span class="nm">3)</span>THE CHATAS OF A KOHEN MASHU'ACH</p>
<p class="bas indent1"><span class="nm">(a)</span><span class="cl">(Mishnah):</span> If a Kohen Mashu'ach (a Kohen Gadol anointed with Shemen ha'Mishchah, i.e. the oil used to anoint the Mishkan) ruled (mistakenly) for himself, and sinned b'Shogeg (through relying on his ruling), he brings a Par;</p>
<p class="bas indent1"><span class="nm">(b)</span>If he b'Mezid perverted the law and later sinned b'Shogeg, or if he ruled mistakenly and later sinned b'Mezid, he is exempt;</p>
<p class="bas indent2"><span class="nm">1.</span>The Hora'ah of a Mashu'ach for himself is like the Hora'ah of Beis Din for the Tzibur.</p>
<p class="bas indent1"><span class="nm">(c)</span><span class="cl">(Gemara) Question:</span> Why must it teach that if he ruled mistakenly, and sinned b'Shogeg, he brings a Par? This is obvious!</p>
<p class="bas indent1"><span class="nm">(d)</span><span class="cl">Answer (Abaye):</span> The case is, he ruled, and forgot his reason. At the time he sinned, he thought 'I rely on my reason, whatever it was.'</p>
<p class="bas indent2"><span class="nm">1.</span>One might have thought that this is like Mezid, for had he recalled his reason, perhaps he would have realized his mistake and not sinned, so he is exempt. The Mishnah teaches that this is not so.</p>
