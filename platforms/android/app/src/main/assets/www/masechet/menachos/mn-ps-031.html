<div class="indent1"><span class="nm">(a)</span><p><span class="cl">Answer #5 (Rav Papa):</span> He said this (the Halachah follows R. Shimon Shezuri here and in all places) concerning the Mishnah about a chest.</p></div>
<div class="indent1"><span class="nm">(b)</span><p><span class="cl">Answer #6 (Rav Nachman bar Yitzchak):</span> He said this concerning the Mishnah about wine.</p></div>
<div class="indent1"><span class="nm">(c)</span><p><span class="cl">(The Mishnah concerning a chest - Beis Shamai):</span> (Wooden Kelim are equated to a sack. They are Mekabel Tum'ah only if they are moved when empty and when full. This excludes a Kli whose volume is at least 40 Sa'im.) We measure the volume of the interior;</p></div>
<div class="indent1"><span class="nm">(d)</span><p>Beis Hillel say, we measure the volume from the outside (i.e. the walls are included);</p></div>
<div class="indent1"><span class="nm">(e)</span><p>R. Yosi says, all agree that (Shitah Mekubetzes - not only the walls, but even) the volume of the legs and rims themselves is included;</p></div>
<div class="indent2"><span class="nm">1.</span><p>The volume between the legs or within the rims is not included.</p></div>
<div class="indent1"><span class="nm">(f)</span><p>R. Shimon Shezuri says, if the legs are a Tefach tall (they are important, and they are not Batel to the chest), what is between them is not included. If they are less than a Tefach, what is between them is included.</p></div>
<div class="indent1"><span class="nm">(g)</span><p><span class="cl">(The Mishnah concerning wine - R. Meir):</span> Oil is (a liquid. Therefore, mid'Rabanan, whenever it is Tamei, it is) always a Rishon l'Tum'ah. (Tosfos - this entire Mishnah discusses liquids that congealed);</p></div>
<div class="indent1"><span class="nm">(h)</span><p>Chachamim say, even honey (is always a Rishon);</p></div>
<div class="indent1"><span class="nm">(i)</span><p>R. Shimon Shezuri says, even wine.</p></div>
<div class="indent1"><span class="nm">(j)</span><p><span class="cl">Question:</span> Do the previous Tana'im say that wine is not (a Rishon)?!</p></div>
<div class="indent1"><span class="nm">(k)</span><p><span class="cl">Correction:</span> Rather, R. Shimon Shezuri says, wine (is a Rishon, but oil and honey are not).</p></div>
<div class="indent1"><span class="nm">(l)</span><p><span class="cl">(Beraisa - R. Shimon Shezuri) Version #1:</span> Once, Tevel became mixed with (a greater quantity of) Chulin. R. Tarfon told me to buy in the market (Demai, from an Am ha'Aretz), and to separate Ma'aser from it on the Tevel in the mixture;</p></div>
<div class="indent2"><span class="nm">1.</span><p>(Because Tevel is the minority, mid'Oraisa it is Batel, and the mixture is Chulin.) R. Tarfon holds that most Amei ha'Aretz take Ma'aser, therefore mid'Oraisa, also Demai is exempt. He tithes from what is exempt on what is exempt. (For both of these, the obligation to tithe is only mid'Rabanan.)</p></div>
<div class="indent1"><span class="nm">(m)</span><p><span class="cl">Question:</span> Why didn't R. Tarfon tell him to buy from a Nochri? (Also his produce is exempt mid'Oraisa!)</p></div>
<div class="indent1"><span class="nm">(n)</span><p><span class="cl">Answer:</span> R. Tarfon holds that even if a Nochri buys land in Eretz Yisrael, it retains its Kedushah. The produce must be tithed mid'Oraisa. One may not separate from what is obligated to exempt produce that is exempt (mid'Oraisa).</p></div>
<div class="indent1"><span class="nm">(o)</span><p><span class="cl">Version #2:</span> R. Tarfon told him to buy produce from a Nochri, and to separate from it on the Tevel in the mixture;</p></div>
<div class="indent2"><span class="nm">1.</span><p>He holds that if a Nochri buys land in Eretz Yisrael, it loses its Kedushah. The produce is exempt from tithes (mid'Oraisa). He tithes from what is exempt on what is exempt.</p></div>
<div class="indent1"><span class="nm">(p)</span><p><span class="cl">Question:</span> Why didn't R. Tarfon tell him to buy Demai?</p></div>
<div class="indent1"><span class="nm">(q)</span><p><span class="cl">Answer:</span> R. Tarfon does not hold that most Amei ha'Aretz take Ma'aser. Rather, it is like an even doubt. Ma'aser must be taken mid'Oraisa. One may not separate from what is obligated to exempt produce that is exempt. (end of Version #2)</p></div>
<div class="indent1"><span class="nm">(r)</span><p><span class="cl">(Rav Yemar bar Shalmiya):</span> (Ravin bar Chinena taught that the Halachah follows R. Shimon Shezuri in all places. Does this include this Beraisa?</p></div>
<div class="indent1"><span class="nm">(s)</span><p><span class="cl">Answer (Rav Papa):</span> Yes.</p></div>
<div class="indent1"><span class="nm">(t)</span><p><span class="cl">Question (Mar Zutra citing R. Chanina of Sura):</span> Why was Rav Yemar unsure? Ravin did not say, the Halachah always follows R. Shimon Shezuri in the Mishnah. He said 'in all places'!</p></div>

<div class="subject"><span class="nm">2)</span><p>A TEAR IN THE PARCHMENT</p></div>
<div class="indent1"><span class="nm">(a)</span><p><span class="cl">(Rav Ze'ira):</span> If a tear in the parchment goes through two lines, it may be fixed. If it goes through three lines, it may not be fixed;</p></div>
<div class="indent1"><span class="nm">(b)</span><p><span class="cl">(Rabah Zuti):</span> A tear through three lines may not be fixed in an old parchment (Rashi - because it does not look nice; Nimukei Yosef  - because it is prone to tear again). In a new parchment it may be fixed;</p></div>
<div class="indent2"><span class="nm">1.</span><p>It does not depend just on old or new;</p></div>
<div class="indent2"><span class="nm">2.</span><p><span class="cl">Version #1 (Rashi):</span> Rather, if the parchment was Afitzan (processed with gallnuts), it is dark, so this is like an old parchment. If it was not Afitzan, this is like new.</p></div>
<div class="indent2"><span class="nm">3.</span><p><span class="cl">Version #2 (Nimukei Yosef):</span> Rather, if the parchment was Afitzan, it is strong, like a new parchment. If it was not Afitzan, this is like old.</p></div>
<div class="indent1"><span class="nm">(c)</span><p>A tear must be fixed with sinews, but not with thread.</p></div>
<div class="indent1"><span class="nm">(d)</span><p><span class="cl">Question (Rav Yehudah bar Aba):</span> If the tear is between columns or between lines, what is the law?</p></div>
<div class="indent1"><span class="nm">(e)</span><p>This question is not resolved.</p></div>
<div class="subject"><span class="nm">3)</span><p>THE SHAPE OF THE WRITING IN A MEZUZAH</p></div>
<div class="indent1"><span class="nm">(a)</span><p><span class="cl">(R. Ze'iri):</span> If two words were written on every line of a Mezuzah, it is Kosher;</p></div>
<div class="indent1"><span class="nm">(b)</span><p><span class="cl">Question:</span> If two words were written on a line, three on the next, and one on the next, what is the law?</p></div>
<div class="indent1"><span class="nm">(c)</span><p><span class="cl">Answer (Rav Nachman bar Yitzchak):</span> All the more so this is Kosher, for (there is a precedent for this;) this is like a Shirah (a part of the Torah in which parts of the lines are left blank).</p></div>
<div class="indent1"><span class="nm">(d)</span><p><span class="cl">Question (Beraisa):</span> If text that should be written normally was written like a Shirah, or vice-versa, this is Pasul.</p></div>
<div class="indent1"><span class="nm">(e)</span><p><span class="cl">Answer:</span> That refers to a Sefer Torah, but in a Mezuzah it is Kosher.</p></div>
<div class="indent1"><span class="nm">(f)</span><p><span class="cl">(Rabah bar bar Chanah):</span> If two words were written on a line, three on the next, and one on the next, it is Kosher;</p></div>
<div class="indent2"><span class="nm">1.</span><p>If it was written like Kubah (1,2,3, it gets progressively wider) or a tail (3,2,1) it is Pasul.</p></div>
<div class="indent1"><span class="nm">(g)</span><p><span class="cl">(Rav Chisda):</span> "Al ha'Aretz" (the last two words) must be (the only words) on the last line.</p></div>
<div class="indent2"><span class="nm">1.</span><p>Some say that it should be at the end of the line. Some say that it should be at the beginning of the line;</p></div>
<div class="indent2"><span class="nm">2.</span><p>The first opinion learns from "chi'Gvo'ah Shamayim Al ha'Aretz" - "Al ha'Aretz" should be at the end of the line, in order that it will be right underneath the previous two words "ki'Yemei ha'Shamayim";</p></div>
<div class="indent2"><span class="nm">3.</span><p>The second opinion intends to maximize the distance between "Al ha'Aretz" and  "ki'Yemei ha'Shamayim." (The blessing is that our days will be as great as this distance.)</p></div>
<div class="indent1"><span class="nm">(h)</span><p><span class="cl">(R. Chelbo):</span> I saw Rav Huna roll his Mezuzah from "Echad" (which is towards the end of the first line, i.e. from the left) towards Shma (on the right). The Parshiyos were closed. (In an open break between Parshiyos, there is a large space extending to the end of the line).</p></div>
