<p class="bas subject"><span class="nm">1)</span>A SLAVE GIVEN FOR COLLATERAL</p>
<p class="bas indent1"><span class="nm">(a)</span><span class="cl">Version #1 (Rashi) Answer #3:</span> (In both cases, the date arrived.) Regarding the field, Reuven did not take the fruit. (Therefore, it is exempt from Ma'aser.)</p>
<p class="bas indent1"><span class="nm">(b)</span><span class="cl">Version #2 (Tosfos) Answer #3:</span> (In Beraisa #1, the date arrived.) The Beraisa teaches that he goes free, even though the Nochri did not yet take him. (In Beraisa #2, the date did not yet arrive.)</p>
<p class="bas indent1"><span class="nm">(c)</span><span class="cl">(Beraisa):</span> If a Nochri collected a slave for payment of a debt, or a slave was given for a bribe to a Nochri who often kills Yisre'elim, he does not go free.</p>
<p class="bas indent1"><span class="nm">(d)</span><span class="cl">Contradiction (Beraisa):</span> If the king's servants took produce of a Yisrael:</p>
<p class="bas indent2"><span class="nm">1.</span>If they took it for payment of a debt, the Yisrael must take Ma'aser on it;</p>
<p class="bas indent2"><span class="nm">2.</span>If it was taken for no reason, he need not take Ma'aser.</p>
<p class="bas indent1"><span class="nm">(e)</span><span class="cl">Answer:</span> Regarding Ma'aser, since the Yisrael benefits from the produce (this pays his debt) he must tithe it. (However, it is not considered a sale to be subject to the fine of our Mishnah.)</p>
<p class="bas indent1"><span class="nm">(f)</span><span class="cl">Question:</span> Rav taught that if Reuven sold his slave to a Nochri who makes false claims to take property, he goes free!</p>
<p class="bas indent1"><span class="nm">(g)</span><span class="cl">Answer:</span> There, Reuven is fined, for he should have appeased the Nochri with other property.</p>
<p class="bas indent1"><span class="nm">(h)</span><span class="cl">(Rav):</span> If Reuven sold his slave to a Nochri who makes false claims to take property, he goes free.</p>
<p class="bas indent1"><span class="nm">(i)</span><span class="cl">Question:</span> Why is Reuven fined? He is blameless!</p>
<p class="bas indent1"><span class="nm">(j)</span><span class="cl">Answer:</span> He should have appeased the Nochri with other property.</p>
<p class="bas indent1"><span class="nm">(k)</span><span class="cl">Question (R. Yirmeyah):</span> If a Yisrael sold his slave to a Nochri for 30 days, what is the law?</p>
<p class="bas indent1"><span class="nm">(l)</span><span class="cl">Answer:</span> Rav taught that if, Reuven sold his slave to a Nochri who makes false claims to take property, he goes free. (We are thinking that he gave his slave only temporarily.)</p>
<p class="bas indent1"><span class="nm">(m)</span><span class="cl">Rejection:</span> No. The case is, he gave the slave permanently.</p>
<p class="bas indent1"><span class="nm">(n)</span><span class="cl">Question:</span> What is the law if the slave was sold on one of the following conditions?</p>
<p class="bas indent2"><span class="nm">1.</span>The buyer cannot make him work.</p>
<p class="bas indent2"><span class="nm">2.</span>The buyer must allow him to keep Mitzvos.</p>
<p class="bas indent2"><span class="nm">3.</span>The buyer cannot make him work on Shabbos and Yom Tov.</p>
<p class="bas indent2"><span class="nm">4.</span>The buyer was a Nochri who accepted to keep his seven Mitzvos.</p>
<p class="bas indent2"><span class="nm">5.</span>The buyer was a Yisrael Mumar (idolater).</p>
<p class="bas indent2"><span class="nm">6.</span>The buyer was a Kusi.</p>
<p class="bas indent1"><span class="nm">(o)</span><span class="cl">Answer (for case 4):</span> Selling to a Nochri who keeps his seven Mitzvos is like selling to a regular Nochri.</p>
<p class="bas indent2"><span class="nm">1.</span>Some say that a Yisrael Mumar and a Kusi are like Nochrim. Some say that they are like Yisre'elim.</p>
<p class="bas subject"><span class="nm">2)</span>A SLAVE WHO GAVE HIMSELF OVER TO CAPTORS</p>
<p class="bas indent1"><span class="nm">(a)</span><span class="cl">Question:</span> If a slave gave himself over to captors, and his owner cannot recover him, neither through courts of Yisrael or the Nochrim, may the owner accept payment from the captors?</p>
<p class="bas indent1"><span class="nm">(b)</span><span class="cl">Answer #1 (R. Zerika - Beraisa):</span> If one sells his house (in Eretz Yisrael) to a Nochri, he may not benefit from the money;</p>
<p class="bas indent2"><span class="nm">1.</span>If a Nochri forcibly took the house, and the Yisrael cannot recover it, neither through courts of Yisrael or the Nochrim, the owner may accept payment for it.</p>
<p class="bas indent2"><span class="nm">2.</span>He may do this through the civil courts, for it is saving his loss.</p>
<p class="bas indent1"><span class="nm">(c)</span><span class="cl">Rejection:</span> Perhaps we do not decree about a house, for everyone needs a house and one would not come to sell willingly. Regarding a slave, we decree, lest he come to sell willingly!</p>
<p class="bas indent1"><span class="nm">(d)</span><span class="cl">Answer #2 (R. Ami):</span> The master may accept payment for his slave. He may do so through the civil courts, for it is saving his loss.</p>
<p class="bas indent1"><span class="nm">(e)</span><span class="cl">Version #1 (R. Yehoshua ben Levi):</span> If Reuven sold his slave to a Nochri, we fine Reuven, and force him to redeem his slave, even for 100 times the sale price.</p>
<p class="bas indent1"><span class="nm">(f)</span><span class="cl">Question:</span> Do we understand 100 literally? (Rashi - or, it is an exaggeration? Tosfos - or, there is no limit?)</p>
<p class="bas indent1"><span class="nm">(g)</span><span class="cl">Answer:</span> Reish Lakish taught that if Reuven sold a work animal to a Nochri, we fine Reuven, and force him to redeem his animal, even for 10 times the sale price. (Rashi - this shows that 100 was an exaggeration; Tosfos - just like we fine even more than 10, we fine even more than 100!)</p>
<p class="bas indent1"><span class="nm">(h)</span><span class="cl">Rejection:</span> Perhaps the sale of a slave is worse, for this prevents the slave from keeping Mitzvos.</p>
<p class="bas indent1"><span class="nm">(i)</span><span class="cl">Version #2 (R. Yehoshua ben Levi):</span> If Reuven sold his slave to a Nochri, we fine Reuven, and force him to redeem his slave, even for 10 times the sale price.</p>
<p class="bas indent1"><span class="nm">(j)</span><span class="cl">Question:</span> Do we understand 10 literally?</p>
<p class="bas indent1"><span class="nm">(k)</span><span class="cl">Answer:</span> Reish Lakish taught that if Reuven sold a work animal to a Nochri, we fine Reuven, and force him to redeem his animal, even for 100 times the sale price.</p>
<p class="bas indent1"><span class="nm">(l)</span><span class="cl">Rejection #1:</span> Perhaps he must pay more to redeem his animal, for he will get to keep his animal. (But when he redeems his slave, the slave is free.)</p>
<p class="bas indent1"><span class="nm">(m)</span><span class="cl">Objection (to rejection):</span> If that is the reason, he should need to pay extra (above 10) only the price (11 in all)!</p>
<p class="bas indent1"><span class="nm">(n)</span><span class="cl">Rejection #2:</span> The sale of a slave to a Nochri is uncommon, so a large fine was not levied for it.</p>
<p class="bas indent1"><span class="nm">(o)</span><span class="cl">Question (R. Yirmeyah):</span> If Reuven sold his slave to a Nochri, and Reuven died, do we force Reuven's son to redeem him?</p>
<p class="bas indent2"><span class="nm">1.</span><span class="cl">Suggestion:</span> If Reuven blemished a Bechor (firstborn male Tahor animal) and he died, we fine his son (that he may never eat the animal, and likewise we fine his son here).</p>
<p class="bas indent2"><span class="nm">2.</span><span class="cl">Rejection:</span> There, Reuven transgressed Torah law. We cannot learn to our case, which is only mid'Rabanan.</p>
<p class="bas bbbline">44b----------------------------------------44b</p>
<p class="bas indent2"><span class="nm">3.</span><span class="cl">Suggestion:</span> If Reuven intentionally left work to do during Chol ha'Mo'ed and he died, we do not fine his son (he may benefit from it. Also here, we do not fine the son.)</p>
<p class="bas indent2"><span class="nm">4.</span><span class="cl">Rejection:</span> There, Reuven died without transgressing. We cannot learn to here, where the father transgressed.</p>
<p class="bas indent2"><span class="nm">5.</span><span class="cl">Summation of question:</span> Here, is the fine against one who sells his slave (but not against his son)? Or is it against the seller's money (and his money must be used to redeem the slave)?</p>
<p class="bas indent1"><span class="nm">(p)</span><span class="cl">Answer (R. Asi - Mishnah):</span> If a field was weeded in Shemitah, it may be seeded the next year. If it was fertilized in Shemitah, it may not be seeded the next year;</p>
<p class="bas indent2"><span class="nm">1.</span><span class="cl">(R. Yosi bar Chanina):</span> If Reuven fertilized it and died, Reuven's son may seed it the next year.</p>
<p class="bas indent2"><span class="nm">2.</span>This shows that we fined only the transgressor, but not his son.</p>
<p class="bas indent1"><span class="nm">(q)</span><span class="cl">(Abaye):</span> If Reuven was Metamei Shimon's food, and Reuven died, Reuven's son need not compensate Shimon.</p>
<p class="bas indent2"><span class="nm">1.</span>This is because undetectable damage is not considered damage. Chachamim fined one who does so. This fine was levied only against the damager, but not against his son.</p>
<p class="bas subject"><span class="nm">3)</span>ONE WHO SOLD HIS SLAVE TO <i>CHUTZ</i> <i>LA'ARETZ</i></p>
<p class="bas indent1"><span class="nm">(a)</span><span class="cl">(Mishnah):</span> Or to Chutz La'aretz...</p>
<p class="bas indent1"><span class="nm">(b)</span><span class="cl">(Beraisa):</span> If one sells his slave to Chutz La'aretz, he goes free, and needs a Get of freedom from the buyer;</p>
<p class="bas indent1"><span class="nm">(c)</span>R. Shimon ben Gamliel says, whether he goes free depends on the wording of the sale:</p>
<p class="bas indent2"><span class="nm">1.</span>If he said 'I sold my slave to Ploni the Antuchi', he does not go free;</p>
<p class="bas indent2"><span class="nm">2.</span>If he said 'I sold my slave to Ploni the Antuchi who lives in Antuchiya', he goes free.</p>
<p class="bas indent1"><span class="nm">(d)</span><span class="cl">Contradiction (Beraisa):</span> If he said 'I sold him to Ploni the Antuchi', he goes free;</p>
<p class="bas indent2"><span class="nm">1.</span>If he said 'I sold him to Ploni the Antuchi who lives in Lud', he does not go free.</p>
<p class="bas indent1"><span class="nm">(e)</span><span class="cl">Answer:</span> If Ploni has a house in Eretz Yisrael, the slave goes free only if he said 'who lives in Antuchiya.' If Ploni has only a place in Eretz Yisrael where he lodges, the slave goes free even if he did not say this.</p>
<p class="bas indent1"><span class="nm">(f)</span><span class="cl">Question (R. Yirmeyah):</span> If a man from Bavel married a woman of Eretz Yisrael, who brought slaves into the marriage, and he intends to return to Bavel, do the slaves go free? (The slaves are Tzon Barzel; he may use them, and when she receives her Kesuvah he returns them. Compensation is given if their value went up or down.)</p>
<p class="bas indent2"><span class="nm">1.</span>We can ask this according to the opinion that the law favors her (she can demand to receive back the same Tzon Barzel property that she brought into the marriage), and according to the opinion that the law favors him (he can keep the property and return its initial value).</p>
<p class="bas indent2"><span class="nm">2.</span>According to the opinion that the law favors her, do we say that it is like her property (the slaves were not sold)?</p>
<p class="bas indent3"><span class="nm">i.</span>Or, since they work for her husband, they are like his?</p>
<p class="bas indent2"><span class="nm">3.</span>According to the opinion that the law favors him, do we say that it is like his property (they were sold)?</p>
<p class="bas indent3"><span class="nm">i.</span>Or, since he only owns their earnings, they are like hers?</p>
<p class="bas indent1"><span class="nm">(g)</span>This question is unresolved.</p>
<p class="bas indent1"><span class="nm">(h)</span><span class="cl">(R. Avahu):</span> If a slave followed his master to Surya and was sold there, he goes free.</p>
<p class="bas indent1"><span class="nm">(i)</span><span class="cl">Question:</span> R. Chiya taught that the slave (by agreeing to leave Eretz Yisrael) lost his privilege (the fine does not apply)!</p>
<p class="bas indent1"><span class="nm">(j)</span><span class="cl">Answer:</span> R. Avahu discusses when the master intended to return to Eretz Yisrael. R. Chiya discusses when he intended to stay in Chutz La'aretz.</p>
<p class="bas indent1"><span class="nm">(k)</span><span class="cl">Support (Beraisa):</span> A slave follows his master to Surya...</p>
<p class="bas indent2"><span class="nm">1.</span><span class="cl">Objection:</span> A slave need not go!</p>
<p class="bas indent3"><span class="nm">i.</span><span class="cl">(Mishnah):</span> One cannot force (his slave ) to leave Eretz Yisrael...</p>
<p class="bas indent2"><span class="nm">2.</span><span class="cl">Correction:</span> Rather, if a slave followed his master to Surya and was sold there, if the master intended to return to Eretz Yisrael, he must free him. If he intended to stay in Chutz La'aretz, he need not free him.</p>
<p class="bas indent1"><span class="nm">(l)</span><span class="cl">Rav Anan:</span> I heard the above teaching from Shmuel, and also the following.</p>
<p class="bas indent2"><span class="nm">1.</span><span class="cl">(Rav):</span> If Reuven sold his field during the Yovel year, it is sold, and reverts to Reuven;</p>
<p class="bas indent2"><span class="nm">2.</span><span class="cl">(Shmuel):</span> It is not sold at all.</p>
<p class="bas indent1"><span class="nm">(m)</span><span class="cl">Question (Rav Anan):</span> In only one case, Shmuel says that the buyer gets back his money - I do not know in which.</p>
<p class="bas indent1"><span class="nm">(n)</span><span class="cl">Answer (Rav Yosef - Beraisa):</span> If one sold his slave to Chutz La'aretz, he goes free and needs a Get of freedom from the buyer.</p>
<p class="bas indent2"><span class="nm">1.</span>Since the buyer owns him, Shmuel cannot say that the money goes back!</p>
<p class="bas indent2"><span class="nm">2.</span><span class="cl">Conclusion:</span> We must say that regarding Yovel, Shmuel says that it is not a sale and the buyer gets back his money.</p>
