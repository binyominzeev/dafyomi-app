<p class="bas indent1"><span class="nm">(a)</span>Ben Zoma gazed and went out of his mind.</p>
<p class="bas indent2"><span class="nm">1.</span>About him the verse says, "If you find sweet honey, eat only what suffices for you, lest it fill you up and you vomit it out" (Mishlei 25:16).</p>
<p class="bas indent2"><span class="nm">2.</span>They asked Ben Zoma several Halachic questions (to test him if he was still out of his mind).</p>
<p class="bas indent2"><span class="nm">3.</span>R. Yehoshua told his students that Ben Zoma was still out of his mind, when Ben Zoma oddly expounded the verse, "And the spirit of G-d levitated above the waters" (Bereishis 1:2).</p>
<p class="bas indent1"><span class="nm">(b)</span>Acher entered the Pardes ("orchard") and "cut down the plantlings" (i.e. he became corrupt).</p>

<p class="bas subject"><span class="nm">2)</span>THE STORY OF ACHER</p>
<p class="bas indent1"><span class="nm">(a)</span>Acher entered the Pardes and cut down the plantlings (i.e. he became corrupt).</p>
<p class="bas indent2"><span class="nm">1.</span>About him the verse says, "Do not let your mouth cause your flesh to sin" (Koheles 5:5).</p>
<p class="bas indent2"><span class="nm">2.</span>What happened to him:</p>
<p class="bas indent2"><span class="nm">3.</span>He saw the angel "Mttrn" who received permission to sit and write the the merits of Yisrael.</p>
<p class="bas indent2"><span class="nm">4.</span>Acher said, "We have a tradition that there is no sitting, competition, no backside, and not tiredness (among the heavenly beings) -- perhaps there are two powers!"</p>
<p class="bas indent2"><span class="nm">5.</span>They took out "Mttrn" and lashed him with 60 pulses of fire and said to him, "You should have stood up when you saw him (an earthly being)!"</p>
<p class="bas indent2"><span class="nm">6.</span>They gave him permission to erase the merits of Acher (because of his blasphemy).</p>
<p class="bas indent2"><span class="nm">7.</span>A Bas Kol issued forth saying, "'Repent, o' wayward children' (Yirmiyahu 3:22) -- except for Acher!"</p>
<p class="bas indent2"><span class="nm">8.</span>When he heard this, Acher said, "Since I have been pushed out from the next world, I might as well go and get pleasure from this world!"</p>
<p class="bas indent2"><span class="nm">9.</span>He went onto an evil path.</p>
<p class="bas indent3"><span class="nm">i.</span>He found a harlot and propositioned her.</p>
<p class="bas indent3"><span class="nm">ii.</span>She said, "But are you not Elisha ben Avuyah!?"</p>
<p class="bas indent3"><span class="nm">iii.</span>He went and uprooted a radish from its row on Shabbos and gave it to her.</p>
<p class="bas indent3"><span class="nm">iv.</span>She said, "You are someone else ('Acher')."</p>
<p class="bas indent1"><span class="nm">(b)</span>Acher asked R. Meir, his Talmid, to explain several verses, and Acher rejected his explanations, saying that his teacher, R. Akiva, expounded them differently.</p>
<p class="bas indent2"><span class="nm">1.</span>R. Meir urged Acher to do Teshuvah, in accordance with one of the explanations of the verses that Acher told him.</p>
<p class="bas indent2"><span class="nm">2.</span>Acher responded, "I have already heard from behind the heavenly curtain that my repentance will not be accepted."</p>
<p class="bas indent1"><span class="nm">(c)</span>It once happened that Acher was riding a horse on Shabbos, and R. Meir was following on foot behind him in order to learn Torah from him.</p>
<p class="bas indent2"><span class="nm">1.</span>Acher said to R. Meir, "Stop here, for I have measured the footsteps of my horse, and until here is the Techum of Shabbos."</p>
<p class="bas indent2"><span class="nm">2.</span>R. Meir said, "You, too, should return!"</p>
<p class="bas indent2"><span class="nm">3.</span>Acher replied, "I have already told you that I have already heard from behind the heavenly curtain that my repentance will not be accepted."</p>
<p class="bas indent2"><span class="nm">4.</span>R. Meir grabbed him and took him to the Beis Midrash.</p>
<p class="bas indent2"><span class="nm">5.</span>Acher told a child to tell him what verse he was learning at the moment.</p>
<p class="bas indent2"><span class="nm">6.</span>The child told him a verse that discusses the permanent stain of sin upon the sinner.</p>
<p class="bas bbbline">15b----------------------------------------15b</p>
<p class="bas indent2"><span class="nm">7.</span>R. Meir took Acher to a total of 13 Batei Midrash, and in each one a child told Acher a verse discussing the irrevokable effect of sin.</p>
<p class="bas indent3"><span class="nm">i.</span>The last child told him the verse, "G-d says to the wicked (Resha'im), 'Why do you discuss my laws!?'" (Tehilim 50:16).</p>
<p class="bas indent3"><span class="nm">ii.</span>That child stuttered, and it sounded like he said, "G-d says to <i>Elisha</i>, 'Why do you discuss my laws!?'"</p>
<p class="bas indent3"><span class="nm">iii.</span>Some say that Acher had a knife and he butchered the child and sent his body parts to the 13 synagogues.</p>
<p class="bas indent3"><span class="nm">iv.</span>Other say that he merely said, "If I had a knife, I would butcher him."</p>
<p class="bas indent1"><span class="nm">(d)</span>When Acher died, they said they he cannot be punished, because he learned Torah, but he also cannot go to Olam ha'Ba, because he sinned.</p>
<p class="bas indent2"><span class="nm">1.</span>R. Meir said it is best that he be punished and then go to Olam ha'Ba.</p>
<p class="bas indent2"><span class="nm">2.</span>He added, "When I die, I will bring up smoke from his grave!"</p>
<p class="bas indent2"><span class="nm">3.</span>When R. Meir died, smoke arose from Acher's grave.</p>
<p class="bas indent2"><span class="nm">4.</span>R. Yochanan said that it is not proper to cause one's teacher to be punished.</p>
<p class="bas indent2"><span class="nm">5.</span>When R. Yochanan died, he caused the smoke to stop rising from Acher's grave and he brought Acher to Olam ha'Ba.</p>
<p class="bas indent3"><span class="nm">i.</span>In the eulogy said for R. Yochanan, it was said that "not even the guard of the gate (of Gehinom) could stand in his way!"</p>
<p class="bas indent1"><span class="nm">(e)</span>Rebbi met a daughter of Acher.</p>
<p class="bas indent2"><span class="nm">1.</span>He was surprised, because the verse (Iyov 18:19) says that a Rasha will have no descendents.</p>
<p class="bas indent2"><span class="nm">2.</span>She said to him, "Remember his Torah, and not his deeds!"</p>
<p class="bas indent2"><span class="nm">3.</span>A fire descended and scorched Rebbi's bench.</p>
<p class="bas indent2"><span class="nm">4.</span>Rebbi cried and said, "If this is the honor that those who disgrace the Torah (such as Acher) receive, then how much more so will be the honor that those who praise the Torah will receive!"</p>
<p class="bas subject"><span class="nm">3)</span>LEARNING TORAH FROM A <i>RASHA</i> LIKE ACHER</p>
<p class="bas indent1"><span class="nm">(a)</span><span class="cl">Question:</span> How could R. Meir learn Torah from Acher?</p>
<p class="bas indent2"><span class="nm">1.</span>The verse (Malachi 2:7) teaches that one should only learn Torah from a Rav who is similar to a Malach of Hash-m!</p>
<p class="bas indent1"><span class="nm">(b)</span><span class="cl">Answer:</span> R. Meir relied on another verse (Mishlei 22:17, or Tehilim (45:11) which teaches that one may learn Torah from a Rasha, as long as one follows Hash-m's laws and not the deeds of the Rasha.</p>
<p class="bas indent1"><span class="nm">(c)</span><span class="cl">Question:</span> If so, the verses (in (a) and (b)) contradict!</p>
<p class="bas indent1"><span class="nm">(d)</span><span class="cl">Answer:</span> One verse refers to a Gadol (one who knows how to be careful not to learn from the deeds of the Rasha may learn Torah from him), and one verse refers to a Katan (one who does not know how to avoid being influenced by the deeds of the Rasha may not learn Torah from him).</p>
<p class="bas indent1"><span class="nm">(e)</span><span class="cl">(R. Dimi):</span> R. Meir ate the outer flesh (the good part) of the fruit, and he discarded the pit (the bad part).</p>
<p class="bas indent1"><span class="nm">(f)</span>Rava expounded a verse (Shir ha'Shirim 6:11) which compares a Talmid Chacham to a nut: just as a nut might become dirty on the surface and its fruit inside is not affected, so, too, a Talmid Chacham who becomes corrupt, his Torah is not affected.</p>
<p class="bas indent1"><span class="nm">(g)</span>Eliyahu ha'Navi told Rabah bar Shila that Hash-m is discussing the teachings of all of the sages, except for R. Meir, since R. Meir learned Torah from Acher.</p>
<p class="bas indent2"><span class="nm">1.</span>Rabah bar Shila defended R. Meir and said that he found a pomegranate and ate the inside (the good part) while he discarded the shell (the bad part).</p>
<p class="bas indent2"><span class="nm">2.</span>Eliyahu said back that now, Hash-m is discussing the teaching of R. Meir.</p>
<p class="bas indent2"><span class="nm">3.</span>R. Meir taught that when a man suffers (by sinning), the Shechinah is pained; if the Shechinah is pained for the blood of a Rasha, how much more so for the blood of Tzadikim that was spilled!</p>
<p class="bas indent1"><span class="nm">(h)</span>Shmuel found R. Yehudah leaning on the doorpost, crying.</p>
<p class="bas indent2"><span class="nm">1.</span>He was crying that if such great sages, such as Doeg and Achitofel, have no share in Olam ha'Ba because of their sins, then how much more so we!</p>
<p class="bas indent2"><span class="nm">2.</span>Shmuel told him that their hearts were corrupt from the beginning (and that is why they went bad and were punished).</p>
<p class="bas subject"><span class="nm">4)</span>WHY DID ACHER GO BAD?</p>
<p class="bas indent1"><span class="nm">(a)</span>Why did Acher go bad?</p>
<p class="bas indent2"><span class="nm">1.</span>Greek (foreign) songs did not cease from his mouth.</p>
<p class="bas indent2"><span class="nm">2.</span>When he would rise from the Beis Midrash, many books of heresy would slip from his lap.</p>
<p class="bas indent1"><span class="nm">(b)</span><span class="cl">Nimus ha'Gardi asked R. Meir:</span> Does all wool that is dyed endure?</p>
<p class="bas indent2"><span class="nm">1.</span><span class="cl">R. Meir answered:</span> Any person who was pure from his beginning will endure.</p>
<p class="bas indent2"><span class="nm">2.</span>And any person who was not pure from his beginning will not endure.</p>
<p class="bas subject"><span class="nm">5)</span>REBBI AKIVA EXITED THE <i>PARDES</i> IN PEACE</p>
<p class="bas indent1"><span class="nm">(a)</span>R. Akiva entered in peace and exited in peace.</p>
<p class="bas indent1"><span class="nm">(b)</span>About him, the verse says, "Draw me after you, and I shall run" (Shir ha'Shirim 1:4).</p>
