<p class="dedicationbox">YOMA 49 - Two weeks of study material have been dedicated by Mrs. Estanne Abraham Fawer to honor the Yahrzeit of her father, Rav Mordechai ben Eliezer Zvi (Rabbi Morton Weiner) Z'L, who passed away on 18 Teves 5760. May the merit of supporting and advancing Dafyomi study -- which was so important to him -- during the weeks of his Yahrzeit serve as an Iluy for his Neshamah. </p>

<div class="subject"><span class="nm">1)</span><p>R. SHEISHES AND HOLACHAH WITH THE LEFT HAND</p></div>
<div class="indent1"><span class="nm">(a)</span><p><span class="cl">Question:</span> But the Beraisa specifically teaches that Holachah (together with Kabalah and Zerikah) with the left hand is Pesulah!?</p></div>
<div class="indent1"><span class="nm">(b)</span><p><span class="cl">Answer:</span> Tiyuvta.</p></div>
<div class="indent1"><span class="nm">(c)</span><p><span class="cl">Question:</span> But we know that R. Sheishes was aware of this Beraisa, as he cited this very Beraisa as a question on R. Chisda!?</p></div>
<div class="indent1"><span class="nm">(d)</span><p><span class="cl">Answer:</span> He asked R. Chisda from this Beraisa after it had been pointed out to him by the questioners.</p></div>
<div class="indent1"><span class="nm">(e)</span><p><span class="cl">Question:</span> But R. Chisda supported himself from a Pasuk (that Holachah is Kesheirah be'Zar)!?</p></div>
<div class="indent1"><span class="nm">(f)</span><p><span class="cl">Answer:</span> The Zar only served to hold the blood, not to carry it at all.</p></div>
<div class="indent1"><span class="nm">(g)</span><p><span class="cl">Question (R. Papa):</span> Would it be permitted for one Kohen to do the Chafinah and place it into the hands of the Kohen Gadol (are both "ve'Lakach" and "ve'Heivi" required, or is a Chafnayim-full enough)?</p></div>
<div class="indent1"><span class="nm">(h)</span><p><span class="cl">Answer:</span> Teiku.</p></div>
<div class="subject"><span class="nm">2)</span><p>USING THE CHAFINAH AFTER THE KOHEN DIES</p></div>
<div class="indent1"><span class="nm">(a)</span><p><span class="cl">Question (R. Yehoshua b. Levi):</span> If the Kohen Gadol dies after placing the flour into the Kaf, may his replacement use his Chafinah?</p></div>
<div class="indent1"><span class="nm">(b)</span><p><span class="cl">(R. Chanina):</span> See the questions of the earlier ones!</p></div>
<div class="indent1"><span class="nm">(c)</span><p><span class="cl">Question:</span> But it seems that R. Chanina was older than R. Yehoshua b. Levi (since the latter turned to the former who permitted drinking Shachalayim on Shabbos)!?</p></div>
<div class="indent2"><span class="nm">1.</span><p>Drinking should be clearly permitted (as we learned from the Mishnah)?!</p></div>
<div class="indent2"><span class="nm">2.</span><p>Rather, he is permitted to pound it and drink it.</p></div>
<div class="indent3"><span class="nm">i.</span><p><span class="cl">Question:</span> If we are speaking of danger, then this is not news; if not, then how could it be permitted?</p></div>
<div class="indent3"><span class="nm">ii.</span><p><span class="cl">Answer:</span> It was a situation of danger, but he was asking for medical advice.</p></div>
<div class="indent3"><span class="nm">iii.</span><p><span class="cl">Question:</span> Why ask this of R. Chanina?</p></div>
<div class="indent3"><span class="nm">iv.</span><p><span class="cl">Answer:</span> He was an expert, as indicated by his claim regarding the fatality rate of an injury from a mule.</p></div>
<div class="indent3"><span class="nm">v.</span><p><span class="cl">Question:</span> But there are survivors!?</p></div>
<div class="indent3"><span class="nm">vi.</span><p><span class="cl">Answer:</span> He was speaking of the live wound.</p></div>
<div class="indent3"><span class="nm">vii.</span><p><span class="cl">Question:</span> But we see those injuries heal!?</p></div>
<div class="indent3"><span class="nm">viii.</span><p><span class="cl">Answer:</span> He was referring to a red mule with white hooves whose injury does not heal.</p></div>
<div class="indent1"><span class="nm">(d)</span><p><span class="cl">Answer:</span> We see from R. Yehoshua's use of the title 'Rebbi' that R. Chanina must have been his senior (and R. Chanina meant to point out that the later scholars asked like the earlier ones).</p></div>
<div class="indent1"><span class="nm">(e)</span><p><span class="cl">Question:</span> But we find that R. Chanina was <i>not</i> in doubt regarding the use of the Chafinah.</p></div>
<div class="indent2"><span class="nm">1.</span><p>He taught that the replacement Kohen must slaughter a new Par as the Pasuk implies "be'Par" 've'Lo be'Damo Shel Par'.</p></div>
<div class="indent2"><span class="nm">2.</span><p>He also taught that the Chafinah done before the Shechitah is meaningless (thus clearly implying that the replacement Kohen may not use the dead Kohen's Chafinah).</p></div>
<div class="indent1"><span class="nm">(f)</span><p><span class="cl">Answer:</span> We must explain R. Chanina's comment regarding R. Yehoshua's question as making two points:</p></div>
<div class="indent2"><span class="nm">1.</span><p>R. Yehoshua's question implies that he holds (not like me, R. Chanina) even with the Dam Par.</p></div>
<div class="indent2"><span class="nm">2.</span><p>His question also echoes those (earlier) who argue with me.</p></div>
<div class="indent1"><span class="nm">(g)</span><p><span class="cl">Answer (R. Papa relating to R. Yehoshua's original query):</span> It depends on whether the Kohen Gadol must make a second Chafinah inside.</p></div>
<div class="indent2"><span class="nm">1.</span><p>If he does, then reusing the previous Kohen's Chafinah should be fine.</p></div>
<div class="indent2"><span class="nm">2.</span><p>If not, then it is a good question!</p></div>
<div class="indent1"><span class="nm">(h)</span><p><span class="cl">(R. Huna):</span> The opposite is the case since then it is <i>surely</i> lacking a Chafinah since his hands are not identical (and the question of reusing the Chafinah is only if there is <i>not</i> a second Chafinah)!</p></div>
<div class="indent1"><span class="nm">(i)</span><p>We see from our Mishnah (ve'Kach Hi Midasah) that there is a second Chafinah.</p></div>
<div class="indent1"><span class="nm">(j)</span><p>Not necessarily (the phrase in the Mishnah may only permit making a Midah or require an exact measure).</p></div>
<div class="bbbline">49b----------------------------------------49b</p></div>
<div class="indent1"><span class="nm">(k)</span><p>We see, then, from a Beraisa which details the procedure (and its difficulty!) of the second Chafinah that, indeed, there are two.</p></div>
<div class="subject"><span class="nm">3)</span><p>USING THE BLOOD OF THE PAR AFTER THE KOHEN DIES</p></div>
<div class="indent1"><span class="nm">(a)</span><p><span class="cl">Question:</span> May the replacement Kohen use the Dam Par of the first (based on how to interpret "Par")?</p></div>
<div class="indent1"><span class="nm">(b)</span><p><span class="cl">Answer:</span> R. Chanina holds <i>not</i> with its Dam; Resh Lakish holds <i>even with</i> its Dam; R. Ami holds <i>not</i> and R. Yitzchak Nafcha holds <i>even with</i>.</p></div>
<div class="indent1"><span class="nm">(c)</span><p><span class="cl">Question (R. Ami of R. Yitzhok Nafcha):</span> If you were correct, then the appointees to a Korban Pesach should be able to withdraw until Zerikah (not Shechitah as in the Mishnah)?!</p></div>
<div class="indent1"><span class="nm">(d)</span><p><span class="cl">Answer:</span> Korban Pesach is different (based on the Pasuk).</p></div>
<div class="indent1"><span class="nm">(e)</span><p><span class="cl">Question (on the <i>even with</i> position):</span> If you were correct, then the Mishnah should allow Pidyon even with a slaughtered Seh (yet the Mishnah restricts this along with other marginal sheep, e.g. Tereifah, Kilayim, etc.)?!</p></div>
<div class="indent1"><span class="nm">(f)</span><p><span class="cl">Answer:</span> Pidyon is different (it is linked to Pesach).</p></div>
<div class="indent1"><span class="nm">(g)</span><p><span class="cl">Question:</span> Then the link should extend to all details of the Pesach applying to Pidyon Peter Chamor!?</p></div>
<div class="indent1"><span class="nm">(h)</span><p><span class="cl">Answer:</span> The repetition of "Tifdeh" gives more options by Pidyon.</p></div>
<div class="indent1"><span class="nm">(i)</span><p><span class="cl">Question:</span> Then the options should include those things which the cited Mishnah had just restricted!?</p></div>
<div class="indent1"><span class="nm">(j)</span><p><span class="cl">Answer:</span> If we would be <i>that</i> inclusive, then the link of "Seh" would lose its function.</p></div>
