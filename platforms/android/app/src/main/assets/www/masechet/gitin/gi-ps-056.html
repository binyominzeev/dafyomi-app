<p class="bas subject"><span class="nm">1)</span>HOW THE <i>CHURBAN</i> CAME (cont.)</p>
<p class="bas indent1"><span class="nm">(a)</span><span class="cl">Bar Kamtza (to himself):</span> Chachamim were there and they did not protest. They must have approved! I will inform on them to the king.</p>
<p class="bas indent1"><span class="nm">(b)</span><span class="cl">Bar Kamtza (to the Keisar):</span> The Jews have rebelled against you.</p>
<p class="bas indent2"><span class="nm">1.</span><span class="cl">Keisar:</span> Why should I believe you?</p>
<p class="bas indent2"><span class="nm">2.</span><span class="cl">Bar Kamtza:</span> Send a Korban, and see if they will offer it.</p>
<p class="bas indent1"><span class="nm">(c)</span>He sent a choice calf with Bar Kamtza. On the way, Bar Kamtza blemished it on the upper lip (some say, in the eye).</p>
<p class="bas indent2"><span class="nm">1.</span>This is not a blemish in a Nochri's Korban (on a private altar), but it is a blemish for Yisrael (or for offering on behalf of Nochrim in the Mikdash).</p>
<p class="bas indent1"><span class="nm">(d)</span>Chachamim thought to offer it, to avoid angering the Keisar.</p>
<p class="bas indent2"><span class="nm">1.</span><span class="cl">R. Zecharyah ben Avkulas:</span> If so, people will say that we may offer blemished animals on the Mizbe'ach!</p>
<p class="bas indent1"><span class="nm">(e)</span>Chachamim thought to kill Bar Kamtza, lest he tell the Keisar that Yisrael did not offer his Korban.</p>
<p class="bas indent2"><span class="nm">1.</span><span class="cl">R. Zecharyah:</span> If so, people will say that one who blemishes a Korban is killed!</p>
<p class="bas indent1"><span class="nm">(f)</span><span class="cl">(R. Yochanan):</span> The humility of R. Zecharyah destroyed our Mikdash, burned our Heichal and exiled us from our land.</p>
<p class="bas indent1"><span class="nm">(g)</span>Niron Keisar led the army sent against Yerushalayim. He shot an arrow eastward, and it fell in Yerushalayim. He shot an arrow westward... in all four directions, and all landed in Yerushalayim.</p>
<p class="bas indent1"><span class="nm">(h)</span>He asked a child 'which verse are you learning?'</p>
<p class="bas indent2"><span class="nm">1.</span><span class="cl">The child:</span> "I will take my vengeance against Edom (Rome), through my nation Yisrael."</p>
<p class="bas indent2"><span class="nm">2.</span><span class="cl">Niron:</span> Hash-m wants to destroy His house, and punish the conqueror!</p>
<p class="bas indent1"><span class="nm">(i)</span>Niron abandoned his position and converted. R. Meir descended from him.</p>
<p class="bas subject"><span class="nm">2)</span>THE HUNGER DURING THE SIEGE</p>
<p class="bas indent1"><span class="nm">(a)</span>Aspasyainus Keisar was sent against Yerushalayim. He besieged it for three years.</p>
<p class="bas indent1"><span class="nm">(b)</span>There were three wealthy men in Yerushalayim - Nakdimon ben Guryon, Ben Kalba Savu'a, and Ben Tztzis ha'Keses.</p>
<p class="bas indent2"><span class="nm">1.</span>Nakdimon ben Guryon was called so because the sun Nokdah (pierced through and reappeared after it set) for him. (The episode is brought in Ta'anis 20a.)</p>
<p class="bas indent2"><span class="nm">2.</span>Ben Kalba Savu'a was called so because anyone who entered his house as hungry as a Kelev (dog) would leave Savu'a (satiated).</p>
<p class="bas indent2"><span class="nm">3.</span>Ben Tztzis ha'Keses was called thusly because the fringes of his Talis dragged on pillows and blankets (he walked only on silk);</p>
<p class="bas indent3"><span class="nm">i.</span>Others say, his Kisei (seat) was among the great officials of Rome.</p>
<p class="bas indent1"><span class="nm">(c)</span>One of these three offered to supply the city (during the siege, for up to 21 years,) with wheat and barley. One offered to supply wine, salt and oil, and the third offered to supply wood.</p>
<p class="bas indent2"><span class="nm">1.</span>The third was most praiseworthy. Rav Chisda trusted his servant with all his keys except for the key to his storehouse of wood.</p>
<p class="bas indent2"><span class="nm">2.</span><span class="cl">Rav Chisda:</span> (To cook) one storehouse of wheat, one needs 60 storehouses of wood.</p>
<p class="bas indent1"><span class="nm">(d)</span>There were provisions for the city for 21 years. Chachamim wanted to make peace with the besieging army. Baryonim (impudent youths) did not allow them.</p>
<p class="bas indent1"><span class="nm">(e)</span><span class="cl">Baryonim:</span> Let us go out and fight them!</p>
<p class="bas indent1"><span class="nm">(f)</span><span class="cl">Chachamim:</span> That will not succeed.</p>
<p class="bas indent2"><span class="nm">1.</span>The Baryonim burned the storehouses of wheat and barley. There was terrible hunger in the city.</p>
<p class="bas indent1"><span class="nm">(g)</span>Marsa bas Baisus was the richest woman in Yerushalayim. She sent her servant to buy fine flour; it was sold out before he got there.</p>
<p class="bas indent2"><span class="nm">1.</span><span class="cl">The servant:</span> There is no fine flour; there is clean bread.</p>
<p class="bas indent2"><span class="nm">2.</span><span class="cl">Marsa:</span> Go buy it.</p>
<p class="bas indent1"><span class="nm">(h)</span>The clean bread was sold out before he got there. He told her that there was coarse bread. She told him to buy it.</p>
<p class="bas indent1"><span class="nm">(i)</span>The coarse bread was sold out before he got there. He told her that there was barley flour. She told him to buy it.</p>
<p class="bas indent1"><span class="nm">(j)</span>The barley flour was sold out before he got there. Marsa Bas Baisus decided to try to find food herself.</p>
<p class="bas indent1"><span class="nm">(k)</span><span class="cl">Version #1:</span> She was barefoot, and stepped on some dung and died (because she was so fastidious).</p>
<p class="bas indent2"><span class="nm">1.</span><span class="cl">R. Yochanan ben Zakai:</span> She exemplified "the soft and delicate among you, who never put her foot on the ground."</p>
<p class="bas indent1"><span class="nm">(l)</span><span class="cl">Version #2:</span> She died from eating figs that R. Tzadok had sucked on.</p>
<p class="bas indent2"><span class="nm">1.</span>R. Tzadok fasted for 40 years that Yerushalayim should not be destroyed. When he would eat, one could see, from the outside, the food passing to his stomach. When he stopped fasting, he would suck the juice of figs, and discard the figs. (end of Version #2)</p>
<p class="bas indent1"><span class="nm">(m)</span>When Marsa was dying, she threw all her money into the street and said 'what good will it do me?!'</p>
<p class="bas indent2"><span class="nm">1.</span>This fulfilled the verse "they will cast out their money."</p>
<p class="bas subject"><span class="nm">3)</span>MAKING <i>SHALOM</i></p>
<p class="bas indent1"><span class="nm">(a)</span>Aba Sikra, the head of the Baryonim, was R. Yochanan ben Zakai's nephew. R. Yochanan ben Zakai asked him to come secretly to see him.</p>
<p class="bas indent2"><span class="nm">1.</span><span class="cl">R. Yochanan ben Zakai:</span> How long will you cause us to die of hunger?</p>
<p class="bas indent2"><span class="nm">2.</span><span class="cl">Aba Sikra:</span> What can I do? If I say anything (suggest making Shalom with the besiegers), the Baryonim will kill me!</p>
<p class="bas indent2"><span class="nm">3.</span><span class="cl">R. Yochanan ben Zakai:</span> Find a way for me to leave the city. Perhaps I can salvage something.</p>
<p class="bas indent2"><span class="nm">4.</span><span class="cl">Aba Sikra:</span> Pretend to be sick. Everyone will come to visit you. Take something putrid with you in the bed, and people will say that you died.</p>
<p class="bas indent2"><span class="nm">5.</span>Instruct that only your Talmidim carry the coffin, for whoever carries it will know that you are alive;</p>
<p class="bas indent3"><span class="nm">i.</span>People know that a corpse is heavier than a living person.</p>
<p class="bas indent1"><span class="nm">(b)</span>R. Yochanan ben Zakai did so. R. Eliezer and R. Yehoshua carried the coffin.</p>
<p class="bas indent1"><span class="nm">(c)</span>At the gate (to leave the city), Baryonim suspected the ruse and wanted to pierce the coffin.</p>
<p class="bas indent2"><span class="nm">1.</span><span class="cl">Chachamim:</span> They besiegers will say that we stabbed our Rebbi!</p>
<p class="bas indent2"><span class="nm">2.</span><span class="cl">Baryonim:</span> Let us jolt the coffin.</p>
<p class="bas indent2"><span class="nm">3.</span><span class="cl">Chachamim:</span> The besiegers will say that we jolted our Rebbi!!</p>
<p class="bas indent1"><span class="nm">(d)</span>The Baryonim allowed them to leave. When R. Yochanan ben Zakai approached Aspanyainus, he said 'Shalom to the king, Shalom to the king,'</p>
<p class="bas indent1"><span class="nm">(e)</span><span class="cl">Aspanyainus:</span> You are worthy of death for two reasons!</p>
<p class="bas indent2"><span class="nm">1.</span>I am not the king;</p>
<p class="bas indent2"><span class="nm">2.</span>If I were the king, why didn't you come to me earlier?!</p>
<p class="bas indent1"><span class="nm">(f)</span><span class="cl">R. Yochanan ben Zakai:</span> Regarding the first point, in truth, you will be king! If not, Yerushalayim would not fall to you;</p>
<p class="bas bbbline">56b----------------------------------------56b</p>
<p class="bas indent2"><span class="nm">1.</span>It says "ha'Levanon will fall to an Adir." Verses teach that Adir means king, and Levanon refers to the Mikdash.</p>
<p class="bas indent2"><span class="nm">2.</span>Regarding the second point, until now, the Baryonim did not allow me to leave.</p>
<p class="bas indent1"><span class="nm">(g)</span><span class="cl">Aspanyainus:</span> If a snake is around a barrel of honey, one should break the barrel to make the snake go away! (You should have burned the wall to dispel the Baryonim.)</p>
<p class="bas indent1"><span class="nm">(h)</span>R. Yochanan ben Zakai was quiet.</p>
<p class="bas indent2"><span class="nm">1.</span><span class="cl">Rav Yosef:</span> "(Hash-m) turns back the wisdom of Chachamim" - he should have answered that one removes the snake with tongs and saves the barrel! (We hoped to overcome the Baryonim and preserve the city wall.)</p>
<p class="bas indent1"><span class="nm">(i)</span>Just then, a Shali'ach came from Rome and said that the Keisar died, and the most important officials decided that Aspanyainus will be the new leader.</p>
<p class="bas indent1"><span class="nm">(j)</span>Aspanyainus had put on one shoe before hearing this. He was unable to put on the other, nor could he take off the first, and did not know why.</p>
<p class="bas indent2"><span class="nm">1.</span><span class="cl">R. Yochanan ben Zakai:</span> Don't worry - "good tidings fatten bones."</p>
<p class="bas indent2"><span class="nm">2.</span><span class="cl">Aspanyainus:</span> What should I do?</p>
<p class="bas indent2"><span class="nm">3.</span><span class="cl">R. Yochanan ben Zakai:</span> Someone you hate should pass in front of you - "a crushed spirit dries bones."</p>
<p class="bas indent2"><span class="nm">4.</span><span class="cl">Aspanyainus:</span> If you are so wise, why didn't you see me until now?</p>
<p class="bas indent2"><span class="nm">5.</span><span class="cl">R. Yochanan ben Zakai:</span> I already told you!</p>
<p class="bas indent2"><span class="nm">6.</span><span class="cl">Aspanyainus:</span> I rejected your answer!</p>
<p class="bas indent1"><span class="nm">(k)</span><span class="cl">Aspanyainus:</span> I will return to Rome and send someone else in my stead. Make a request, and I will grant it.</p>
<p class="bas indent2"><span class="nm">1.</span><span class="cl">R. Yochanan ben Zakai:</span> Do not destroy Yavneh and its Chachamim, do not kill off the line of R. Gamliel, and give us doctors to cure R. Tzadok.</p>
<p class="bas indent1"><span class="nm">(l)</span><span class="cl">(Rav Yosef):</span> "(Hash-m) turns back the wisdom of Chachamim" - he should have asked him to pardon Yerushalayim this time!</p>
<p class="bas indent2"><span class="nm">1.</span>R. Yochanan ben Zakai thought that perhaps he would not agree, and nothing will be salvaged.</p>
<p class="bas indent1"><span class="nm">(m)</span><span class="cl">Question:</span> How did they cure R. Tzadok?</p>
<p class="bas indent1"><span class="nm">(n)</span><span class="cl">Answer:</span> The first day, he drank water in which bran was soaked. The next day he drank water in which large bran and flour was soaked. The next day he drank water in which flour was mixed in.</p>
<p class="bas indent2"><span class="nm">1.</span>With time, his intestines grew (and he was able to eat again).</p>
<p class="bas subject"><span class="nm">4)</span>TITUS</p>
<p class="bas indent1"><span class="nm">(a)</span>Aspanyainus sent Titus to conquer Yerushalayim. Titus blasphemed "where is the Rock they trusted in?!"</p>
<p class="bas indent2"><span class="nm">1.</span>He took a harlot into the Kodesh ha'Kodoshim (the holiest part of the Mikdash), spread a Sefer Torah, and sinned on it.</p>
<p class="bas indent2"><span class="nm">2.</span>He took a sword and pierced the Paroches (the curtain in front of the Kodesh ha'Kodoshim); miraculously, blood spurted out.</p>
<p class="bas indent2"><span class="nm">3.</span>He thought he had killed 'himself' (this is a euphemism for Him) - "the enemies roared in Your meeting place; they believed in their omens."</p>
<p class="bas indent1"><span class="nm">(b)</span><span class="cl">(Aba Chanan):</span> "Mi Chamocha Chasin Kah" - who has restraint like You?! You hear the blasphemy of that Rasha, and You are silent!</p>
<p class="bas indent2"><span class="nm">1.</span><span class="cl">(Tana d'Vei R. Yishmael):</span> "Mi Chamocha ba'Elim Hash-m" - who is like You among the Ilmim? (You are silent like a mute!)</p>
<p class="bas indent1"><span class="nm">(c)</span>Titus took the Paroches, and made it like a sack in which he took all the Kelim of the Mikdash. He boarded a boat to return to aggrandize himself in his city.</p>
<p class="bas indent2"><span class="nm">1.</span>"I have seen buried wicked people. They came from a holy place, they go and are forgotten in the city that they did so" - do not read Kevurim (buried), rather Kevutzim gathered). Do not read forgotten (va'Yishtachechu), rather va'Yishtabchu (they praised themselves).</p>
<p class="bas indent2"><span class="nm">2.</span>Others expound "buried" to teach that even our buried treasures were exposed to them.</p>
<p class="bas indent1"><span class="nm">(d)</span>A stormy wind was about to sink Titus' boat.</p>
<p class="bas indent2"><span class="nm">1.</span><span class="cl">Titus:</span> Their G-d has power only in water. He drowned Pharoah and Sisero (and their armies) in water, and now He wants to drown me!</p>
<p class="bas indent2"><span class="nm">2.</span>If He is mighty, let Him come onto the land and fight me!</p>
<p class="bas indent2"><span class="nm">3.</span><span class="cl">A voice from Heaven:</span> Rasha, son of a Rasha, descendant of Esav the Rasha! I have a light creation in my world, the mosquito. Come to land and fight it!</p>
<p class="bas indent3"><span class="nm">i.</span><span class="cl">Question:</span> Why is it called a light creation?</p>
<p class="bas indent3"><span class="nm">ii.</span><span class="cl">Answer:</span> It has a mouth, but nothing from which to excrete.</p>
<p class="bas indent1"><span class="nm">(e)</span>Titus alighted. A mosquito entered his nose and bored into his brain for seven years.</p>
<p class="bas indent2"><span class="nm">1.</span>One day, he was passing by a smith, and heard the hammer banging. The mosquito stopped pecking. He found a solution!</p>
<p class="bas indent2"><span class="nm">2.</span>Each day he brought a smith to bang in front of him. If it was a Nochri, he would pay him four Zuz. If it was a Yisrael, he said 'it suffices that you see your enemy (being punished).'</p>
<p class="bas indent2"><span class="nm">3.</span>After 30 days, the mosquito became used to the banging, and it resumed pecking.</p>
<p class="bas indent1"><span class="nm">(f)</span><span class="cl">(Beraisa#1 - R. Pinchas ben Arova):</span> When he died, they pierced his skull. A wild bird was found, weighing two Sela'im;</p>
<p class="bas indent1"><span class="nm">(g)</span><span class="cl">(Beraisa #2):</span> It was like a year old bird weighing two Litrin.</p>
<p class="bas indent1"><span class="nm">(h)</span><span class="cl">(Abaye):</span> Its mouth was copper, its claws were iron.</p>
<p class="bas indent1"><span class="nm">(i)</span>When Titus was dying, he asked to be cremated, and that his ashes be spread on the seven seas, lest the G-d of Yisrael be able to judge him.</p>
<p class="bas indent1"><span class="nm">(j)</span>Unkelus bar Klonikus was Titus' nephew; he wanted to convert. He conjured up his uncle from the dead.</p>
<p class="bas indent2"><span class="nm">1.</span><span class="cl">Unkelus:</span> Who is important in the next world?</p>
<p class="bas indent2"><span class="nm">2.</span><span class="cl">Titus:</span> Yisrael are.</p>
<p class="bas indent2"><span class="nm">3.</span><span class="cl">Unkelus:</span> Should I cling to them (convert)?</p>
<p class="bas indent2"><span class="nm">4.</span><span class="cl">Titus:</span> They have too many Mitzvos, you cannot fulfill them. Rather, fight them in your world, and you will become a head.</p>
<p class="bas indent3"><span class="nm">i.</span>"Its oppressors became leaders" - whoever oppresses Yisrael becomes a leader.</p>
<p class="bas indent2"><span class="nm">5.</span><span class="cl">Unkelus:</span> What was your judgment?</p>
<p class="bas indent2"><span class="nm">6.</span><span class="cl">Titus:</span> It is what I myself declared. Each day, my ashes are gathered, judged, burned, and scattered on the seven seas.</p>
<p class="bas normal"></p>
