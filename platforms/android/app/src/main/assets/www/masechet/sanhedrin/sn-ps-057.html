<p class="bas subject"><span class="nm">1)</span>HOW TANA D'VEI MENASHEH LEARNS</p>
<p class="bas indent1"><span class="nm">(a)</span><span class="cl">Question:</span> If Tana d'Vei Menasheh expounds the verse "Va'Ytzav", he should include Dinim and blasphemy. If he does not expound it, how does he know the other five (which were derived from the verse)?</p>
<p class="bas indent1"><span class="nm">(b)</span><span class="cl">Answer:</span> He does not expound it. All seven Mitzvos are written elsewhere:</p>
<p class="bas indent2"><span class="nm">1.</span>We learn idolatry and Arayos from "va'Tishaches ha'Aretz Lifnei ha'Elokim."</p>
<p class="bas indent3"><span class="nm">i.</span><span class="cl">(Tana d'Vei R. Yishmael):</span> 'Hashchasah' always refers to Arayos and idolatry:</p>
<p class="bas indent3"><span class="nm">ii.</span>It says about Arayos "Ki Hishchis Kol Basar Es Darko";</p>
<p class="bas indent3"><span class="nm">iii.</span>It says about idolatry "Pen Tashchisun va'Asisem Pesel."</p>
<p class="bas indent3"><span class="nm">iv.</span>The Tana who learns from "va'Ytzav Hash-m..." says that the Torah merely discusses the generation of the flood. These are not commandments.</p>
<p class="bas indent2"><span class="nm">2.</span>We learn murder from "Shofech Dam ha'Adam...";</p>
<p class="bas indent3"><span class="nm">i.</span>The other Tana says that this comes to teach about the punishment. The verse continues "...Ba'Adam Damo Yishafech";</p>
<p class="bas indent2"><span class="nm">3.</span>We learn theft from "k'Yerek Esev Nosati Lachem Es Kol";</p>
<p class="bas indent3"><span class="nm">i.</span><span class="cl">(R. Levi):</span> This permits what is like Yerek Esev (that grows by itself, i.e. Hefker), and not what grows in gardens.</p>
<p class="bas indent3"><span class="nm">ii.</span>The other Tana says that this comes to permit eating meat (which was forbidden before this).</p>
<p class="bas indent2"><span class="nm">4.</span>We learn Ever Min ha'Chai from "Ach Basar b'Nafsho Damo Lo Sochelu";</p>
<p class="bas indent3"><span class="nm">i.</span>The other Tana says that this comes to permit Sheratzim (rodents, even before they die).</p>
<p class="bas indent2"><span class="nm">5.</span>We learn castration from "Shirtzu va'Aretz u'Rvu Vah";</p>
<p class="bas indent3"><span class="nm">i.</span>The other Tana says that this is a blessing, and not a Mitzvah.</p>
<p class="bas indent2"><span class="nm">6.</span>We learn Kilayim from "meha'Of l'Minehu";</p>
<p class="bas indent3"><span class="nm">i.</span>The other Tana says that the birds (and animals) in the ark were according to their species, for this is the best companionship. We may not derive an Isur of mating diverse species.</p>
<p class="bas subject"><span class="nm">2)</span>WHAT ARE BNEI NOACH KILLED FOR?</p>
<p class="bas indent1"><span class="nm">(a)</span><span class="cl">(Rav Yosef):</span> A Ben Noach has three Chayavei Misah - Arayos, murder and blasphemy.</p>
<p class="bas indent1"><span class="nm">(b)</span><span class="cl">Objection (Rav Sheshes):</span> Granted, we learn murder from "Shofech Dam ha'Adam ba'Adam Damo Yishafech". What is the source for the other two?</p>
<p class="bas indent2"><span class="nm">1.</span>If you learn from murder, he should be liable for all his Mitzvos!</p>
<p class="bas indent2"><span class="nm">2.</span>If they are included because it says "Ish Ish", it says so also regarding idolatry!</p>
<p class="bas indent1"><span class="nm">(c)</span><span class="cl">(Rav Sheshes):</span> Rather, he has four Chayavei Misah, i.e. these three and idolatry.</p>
<p class="bas indent1"><span class="nm">(d)</span><span class="cl">Question:</span> He is not killed for idolatry!</p>
<p class="bas indent2"><span class="nm">1.</span><span class="cl">(Beraisa):</span> Regarding idolatry, a Nochri is commanded only about things that a Yisrael is killed for.</p>
<p class="bas indent2"><span class="nm">2.</span><span class="cl">Inference:</span> He is <i>commanded</i>, but he is not killed for it!</p>
<p class="bas indent1"><span class="nm">(e)</span><span class="cl">Answer (Rav Nachman bar Yitzchak):</span> Anything a Ben Noach is commanded, he is Chayav Misah if he transgresses it.</p>
<p class="bas indent1"><span class="nm">(f)</span><span class="cl">(Rav Huna and all Rav's Talmidim):</span> He is Chayav Misah for any of his seven Mitzvos. The Torah taught about one of them, and the same applies to all of them.</p>
<p class="bas indent1"><span class="nm">(g)</span><span class="cl">Question:</span> He is not killed for theft!</p>
<p class="bas indent2"><span class="nm">1.</span><span class="cl">(Beraisa):</span> Regarding robbery, theft, taking a Yafes To'ar (another man's wife in war, which resembles theft) and everything like this:</p>
<p class="bas indent3"><span class="nm">i.</span>If a Nochri takes from a Nochri or from a Yisrael, it is forbidden. A Yisrael is permitted to take from a Nochri.</p>
<p class="bas indent2"><span class="nm">2.</span>If a Nochri is Chayav Misah for this, it should say so (and not just that he is forbidden)!</p>
<p class="bas indent1"><span class="nm">(h)</span><span class="cl">Answer:</span> He is Chayav Misah. It says 'forbidden' due to the next clause, a Yisrael is <i>permitted</i>.</p>
<p class="bas indent1"><span class="nm">(i)</span><span class="cl">Question:</span> Whenever he is liable, the Tana says so!</p>
<p class="bas indent2"><span class="nm">1.</span><span class="cl">(Reisha of the Beraisa):</span> If a Nochri kills a Nochri or a Yisrael, he is liable;</p>
<p class="bas indent3"><span class="nm">i.</span>If a Yisrael kills a Nochri, he is exempt.</p>
<p class="bas indent1"><span class="nm">(j)</span><span class="cl">Answer:</span> There, there was no other way to teach!</p>
<p class="bas indent2"><span class="nm">1.</span><span class="cl">Suggestion:</span> It could say 'a Nochri is forbidden, and a Yisrael is permitted.'</p>
<p class="bas indent2"><span class="nm">2.</span><span class="cl">Rejection (Beraisa):</span> Nochrim and people who graze (their own) small animals (they constantly steal by grazing on others' property): we do not throw them into a pit (to actively kill them), nor do we raise them from a pit to save them. (I.e. it is not permitted to overtly kill Nochrim.)</p>
<p class="bas indent1"><span class="nm">(k)</span><span class="cl">Question:</span> The Beraisa alludes to a similar case regarding robbery. What is it?</p>
<p class="bas indent1"><span class="nm">(l)</span><span class="cl">Answer #1 (Rav Acha bar Yakov):</span> This teaches about a worker (eating) in a vineyard.</p>
<p class="bas indent2"><span class="nm">1.</span><span class="cl">Question:</span> When is he eating?</p>
<p class="bas indent3"><span class="nm">i.</span>If the fruit is finished, he may eat!</p>
<p class="bas indent3"><span class="nm">ii.</span>If the fruit is not finished, this is fully- fledged theft!</p>
<p class="bas indent2"><span class="nm">2.</span><span class="cl">Answer (Rav Papa):</span> (The fruit is not finished.) The case is, he eats less than the value of a Perutah.</p>
<p class="bas indent2"><span class="nm">3.</span><span class="cl">Question:</span> If so, why is a Nochri forbidden to eat from a Yisrael? A Yisrael pardons less than the value of a Perutah!</p>
<p class="bas indent2"><span class="nm">4.</span><span class="cl">Answer:</span> Later, he pardons. Initially, it bothers him.</p>
<p class="bas indent2"><span class="nm">5.</span><span class="cl">Objection:</span> When a Nochri eats from a Nochri, since Nochrim do not pardon less than the value of a Perutah, this is fully-fledged theft!</p>
<p class="bas indent1"><span class="nm">(m)</span><span class="cl">Answer #2 (Rav Acha brei d'Rav Ika):</span> The case is, he withheld wages:</p>
<p class="bas indent2"><span class="nm">1.</span>If a Nochri withheld wages from a Nochri or from a Yisrael, it is forbidden. A Yisrael may withhold wages from a Nochri.</p>
<p class="bas indent1"><span class="nm">(n)</span><span class="cl">Question:</span> What is the case similar to a Yafes To'ar?</p>
<p class="bas indent1"><span class="nm">(o)</span><span class="cl">Answer (Rav Dimi):</span> If a Nochri had Bi'ah with a female slave designated for a male slave, he is killed. (Rashi - this is like stealing.)</p>
<p class="bas indent1"><span class="nm">(p)</span><span class="cl">Observation:</span> The Tana did not say that there is a similar case regarding murder.</p>
<p class="bas indent1"><span class="nm">(q)</span><span class="cl">(Abaye):</span> If one finds a Beraisa teaching such a case, it is R. Yonason ben Sha'ul.</p>
<p class="bas indent2"><span class="nm">1.</span><span class="cl">(Beraisa - R. Yonason ben Sha'ul):</span> If Reuven was chasing Shimon (to kill him), and Shimon could have stopped him by maiming one of his limbs, but he instead killed him, Shimon is (Rambam - worthy of being) killed for this.</p>

<p class="bas subject"><span class="nm">3)</span>CONDEMNING A BEN NOACH</p>
<p class="bas indent1"><span class="nm">(a)</span><span class="cl">(R. Yakov bar Acha - Sefer Agadata):</span> A Ben Noach can be sentenced to death by one judge, based on one witness, without warning;</p>
<p class="bas indent2"><span class="nm">1.</span>The judge (or witness) cannot be a woman. He can be a relative.</p>
<p class="bas indent1"><span class="nm">(b)</span><span class="cl">(R. Yishmael):</span> A Ben Noach is killed for killing a fetus.</p>
<p class="bas indent1"><span class="nm">(c)</span><span class="cl">Question:</span> What is the source of R. Yakov's law?</p>
<p class="bas indent1"><span class="nm">(d)</span><span class="cl">Answer (Rav Yehudah):</span> "Ach Es Dimchem l'Nafshoseichem <i>Edrosh</i> (singular)", even through one judge. (I will punish) "mi'Yad Kol Chayah" - without warning. "Edreshenu umi'Yad ha'Adam", through one witness; "mi'Yad Ish", but not through a woman; "Achiv", even through a relative.</p>
<p class="bas indent1"><span class="nm">(e)</span><span class="cl">Question:</span> What is the source of R. Yishmael's law?</p>
<p class="bas indent1"><span class="nm">(f)</span><span class="cl">Answer:</span> "Shofech Dam <i>ha'Adam ba'Adam</i> Damo Yishafech" - the case of a person in a person is a fetus.</p>
<p class="bas indent1"><span class="nm">(g)</span>The first Tana holds like Tana d'Vei Menasheh, who says that a Ben Noach is always choked;</p>
<p class="bas indent2"><span class="nm">1.</span>He expounds "<i>ba</i>'Adam Damo Yishafech" - his blood will remain inside his body, i.e. he will be choked.</p>
<p class="bas indent1"><span class="nm">(h)</span><span class="cl">Question (Rav Hamnuna):</span> Is it really true that a Bas Noach is not commanded about Dinim?! (We said that she cannot be a judge or witness.)</p>
<p class="bas indent2"><span class="nm">1.</span>It says "(Avraham)... Yetzaveh (Es Banav v'Es Beiso, his sons and daughters)"!</p>
<p class="bas indent1"><span class="nm">(i)</span><span class="cl">Answer (Rav Hamnuna):</span> He will command his sons about laws, and his daughters about Tzedakah.</p>
<p class="bas indent1"><span class="nm">(j)</span><span class="cl">Question (Rav Avya Sava):</span> (If "mi'Yad Ish" excludes women, we should say that Hash-m will not punish a woman murderer.) If a Bas Noach killed, is she exempt?!</p>
<p class="bas indent1"><span class="nm">(k)</span><span class="cl">Answer (Rav Papa):</span> Rav Yehudah taught that "Shofech Dam ha'Adam..." teaches that the murderer is always killed (even if it is a woman).</p>
<p class="bas indent1"><span class="nm">(l)</span><span class="cl">Question (Rav Avya Sava):</span> "Al Ken Ya'azov <i>Ish</i> (...v'Dovak b'Ishto)" - if a Bas Noach was Mezanah, is she exempt?!</p>
<p class="bas indent1"><span class="nm">(m)</span><span class="cl">Answer (Rav Papa):</span> Rav Yehudah taught that "v'Hayu l'Basar Echad" equates men and women (for Arayos).</p>
<p class="bas subject"><span class="nm">4)</span>WHICH ARAYOS APPLY TO NOCHRIM?</p>
<p class="bas indent1"><span class="nm">(a)</span><span class="cl">(Beraisa):</span> "Ish Ish (...Lo Sikrevu Legalos Ervah)" includes Nochrim (they are commanded about Arayos).</p>
<p class="bas indent1"><span class="nm">(b)</span><span class="cl">Question:</span> We expounded "Leimor" to teach (that Nochrim are commanded) about Arayos!</p>
<p class="bas indent1"><span class="nm">(c)</span><span class="cl">Answer:</span> This teaches about their Arayos. "Ish Ish" teaches about ours.</p>
<p class="bas indent1"><span class="nm">(d)</span><span class="cl">(Seifa):</span> If a Nochri had Bi'ah with Arayos of Yisrael, he is judged according to laws of Yisrael.</p>
<p class="bas indent1"><span class="nm">(e)</span><span class="cl">Question:</span> How does this make a difference?</p>
<p class="bas indent1"><span class="nm">(f)</span><span class="cl">Answer #1 (Rav Nachman):</span> We need 23 judges, two witnesses and warning to convict him.</p>
<p class="bas indent1"><span class="nm">(g)</span><span class="cl">Objection:</span> It is unreasonable to say that it is harder to convict him for our Arayos than for theirs!</p>
<p class="bas indent1"><span class="nm">(h)</span><span class="cl">Answer #2 (R. Yochanan):</span> This teaches about a Na'arah Me'orasah, which does not apply to them (therefore, he is stoned, according to our law).</p>
<p class="bas indent1"><span class="nm">(i)</span><span class="cl">Question (Beraisa):</span> If a Nochri had Bi'ah with a Na'arah Me'orasah, he is stoned. If he had Bi'ah with a married woman (Nesu'ah), he is choked.</p>
<p class="bas indent2"><span class="nm">1.</span>Since Nesu'ah applies to Nochrim, he should receive his usual death, beheading!</p>
<p class="bas indent1"><span class="nm">(j)</span><span class="cl">Answer #1 (Rav Nachman bar Yitzchak):</span> When the Beraisa discusses a married woman, it refers to a woman who had Chupah but did not yet have Bi'ah with her husband;</p>
<p class="bas indent2"><span class="nm">1.</span>Since this does not apply to Nochrim, he receives the law of Yisrael, choking.</p>
<p class="bas indent2"><span class="nm">2.</span><span class="cl">(R. Chanina):</span> Be'ulas Ba'al (a Nochris who had Bi'ah with her husband) applies to Nochrim. A Nochris who had Chupah but did not yet have Bi'ah with her husband is still considered single.</p>
<p class="bas indent1"><span class="nm">(k)</span><span class="cl">Support (for R. Yochanan - Beraisa #1 - R. Meir):</span> A Nochri is commanded only about the Arayos that a Yisrael is killed for;</p>
<p class="bas indent1"><span class="nm">(l)</span>Chachamim say, he is commanded about many Arayos (Gra's text - an Ervah) that Yisraelim are not killed for;</p>
<p class="bas indent2"><span class="nm">1.</span>If he had Bi'ah with Arayos of Yisrael (a married Yisraelis), he is judged by laws of Yisrael. If he had Bi'ah with Arayos of Nochrim (a Nochris), he is judged by laws of Nochrim.</p>
<p class="bas indent2"><span class="nm">2.</span>The only case (in which it makes a difference) is a Na'arah Me'orasah. (We stone for Bi'ah with a Yisraelis Na'arah Me'urasah.)</p>
<p class="bas indent2"><span class="nm">3.</span><span class="cl">Question:</span> Why doesn't it also list a woman who had Chupah but did not yet have Bi'ah with her husband?</p>
<p class="bas indent2"><span class="nm">4.</span><span class="cl">Answer:</span> The Tana holds like Tana d'Vei Menasheh, who says that a Ben Noach is always choked. It makes no difference whether he is judged by our law or theirs.</p>
