<p class="dedicationbox">AVODAH ZARAH 3 - Two weeks of study material have been dedicated by Mrs. Estanne Abraham Fawer to honor the Yahrzeit of her father, Rav Mordechai ben Eliezer Zvi (Rabbi Morton Weiner) Z'L, who passed away on 18 Teves 5760. May the merit of supporting and advancing Dafyomi study -- which was so important to him -- during the weeks of his Yahrzeit serve as an Iluy for his Neshamah. </p>

<p class="bas subject"><span class="nm">1)</span>YISRAEL KEPT THEIR MITZVOS, THE NOCHRIM DID NOT</p>
<p class="bas indent1"><span class="nm">(a)</span><span class="cl">Question:</span> What is the source that they did not keep their seven Mitzvos?</p>
<p class="bas indent1"><span class="nm">(b)</span><span class="cl">Answer:</span> We learn from Rav Yosef;</p>
<p class="bas indent2"><span class="nm">1.</span><span class="cl">(Rav Yosef):</span> "Ra'ah va'Yater Goyim" - Hash-m saw that they did not keep the seven Mitzvos they had accepted, therefore he permitted their Mitzvos to them.</p>
<p class="bas indent2"><span class="nm">2.</span><span class="cl">Objection:</span> If so, they gained from their sin!</p>
<p class="bas indent2"><span class="nm">3.</span><span class="cl">Answer (Mar brei d'Ravina):</span> He means, Hash-m decreed that they will no longer get reward for keeping them.</p>
<p class="bas indent2"><span class="nm">4.</span><span class="cl">Objection (Beraisa - R. Meir):</span> "Asher Ya'aseh Osam ha'Adam v'Chai Bahem" - it does not say that Bnei Yisrael will live through the Mitzvos, rather 'ha'Adam', to teach that even a Nochri who engages in Torah gets reward, just like a Kohen Gadol.</p>
<p class="bas indent2"><span class="nm">5.</span><span class="cl">Correction:</span> Rather, Hash-m decreed that they will no longer get reward for them like one who is commanded and observes, rather like one who is not commanded and observes.</p>
<p class="bas indent3"><span class="nm">i.</span><span class="cl">(R. Chanina):</span> One who is commanded and observes is greater than one who is not commanded and observes.</p>
<p class="bas indent1"><span class="nm">(c)</span><span class="cl">Nochrim:</span> What is the source that Yisrael kept the entire Torah?</p>
<p class="bas indent1"><span class="nm">(d)</span><span class="cl">Hash-m:</span> I testify that they did.</p>
<p class="bas indent1"><span class="nm">(e)</span><span class="cl">Nochrim:</span> A father cannot testify for his son, and You call Yisrael Your son -"Beni Bechori Yisrael"!</p>
<p class="bas indent1"><span class="nm">(f)</span><span class="cl">Hash-m:</span> Heaven and earth will testify for them.</p>
<p class="bas indent1"><span class="nm">(g)</span><span class="cl">Nochrim:</span> They are partial, they cannot testify - "Im Lo Brisi Yomam va'Laylah Chukos Shamayim va'Aretz Lo Samti";</p>
<p class="bas indent2"><span class="nm">1.</span><span class="cl">(Reish Lakish):</span> "Yom ha'Shishi" - Hash-m created the world on condition that Yisrael will accept His Torah on the sixth of Sivan; if they will not, the world will revert to emptiness.</p>
<p class="bas indent2"><span class="nm">2.</span><span class="cl">Question (Chizkiyah):</span> "Mi'Shamayim Hishmata Din Eretz Yar'ah v'Shakatah" - if the land was afraid, why was it quiet?!</p>
<p class="bas indent2"><span class="nm">3.</span><span class="cl">Answer (Chizkiyah):</span> At first it was afraid. After Yisrael accepted the Torah, it was quiet.</p>
<p class="bas indent1"><span class="nm">(h)</span><span class="cl">Hash-m:</span> You yourselves will testify that Yisrael kept the entire Torah:</p>
<p class="bas indent2"><span class="nm">1.</span>Nimrod will testify that Avraham refused to serve idolatry. Lavan will testify that Yakov did not steal. Potifera's wife will testify that Yosef refused to commit adultery. Nebuchadnetzar will testify that Chananyah, Misha'el and Azaryah refused to bow to the image. Daryavesh will testify that Daniel did not miss praying. Elifaz ha'Temani, Bildad ha'Shuchi, Tzufar ha'Na'amasi (Iyov's friends) will testify that Yisrael kept the entire Torah - "Yitenu Edeihem v'Yitzdaku."</p>
<p class="bas subject"><span class="nm">2)</span>THE NOCHRIM SEEK REWARD</p>
<p class="bas indent1"><span class="nm">(a)</span><span class="cl">Nochrim:</span> Give us the Torah now and we will observe it!</p>
<p class="bas indent1"><span class="nm">(b)</span><span class="cl">Hash-m:</span> Fools! Only one who prepared from before Shabbos will have what to eat on Shabbos! (This is a parable. Only one who observed Mitzvos in this world will get reward in the world to come)!</p>
<p class="bas indent2"><span class="nm">1.</span>Nevertheless, I will give to you an easy Mitzvah, i.e. Sukah. Go do it!</p>
<p class="bas indent2"><span class="nm">2.</span><span class="cl">Question:</span> R. Yehoshua ben Levi taught that "Asher Anochi Metzavecha ha'Yom" - today (this world) is for doing Mitzvos, and not tomorrow (the world to come). Today (this world) is for doing Mitzvos, and not for receiving their reward.</p>
<p class="bas indent2"><span class="nm">3.</span><span class="cl">Answer:</span> Hash-m does not deal unfairly with His creations. (Perhaps He gave them another chance in order to show them that they do not deserve reward - <b>PF</b>.)</p>
<p class="bas indent2"><span class="nm">4.</span><span class="cl">Question:</span> Why is Sukah called an easy Mitzvah?</p>
<p class="bas indent2"><span class="nm">5.</span><span class="cl">Answer:</span> One need not spend money for it.</p>
<p class="bas indent1"><span class="nm">(c)</span>Immediately, all the Nochrim build Sukos on their roofs. Hash-m makes the sun beat on them like it does in the heat of summer. The Nochrim kick the Sukos and leave - "Nenatkah Es Moseroseimu v'Nashlichah Mimenu Avoseimu."</p>
<p class="bas indent1"><span class="nm">(d)</span><span class="cl">Question:</span> Making the sun beat on them is dealing unjustly with them!</p>
<p class="bas indent1"><span class="nm">(e)</span><span class="cl">Answer:</span> It is not. Also Yisraelim suffer this way, when the intense heat of summer persists until Sukos.</p>
<p class="bas bbbline">3b----------------------------------------3b</p>
<p class="bas indent1"><span class="nm">(f)</span><span class="cl">Question:</span> Rava taught that one who is in pain is exempt from the Sukah! (Also Yisraelim would leave in such heat.)</p>
<p class="bas indent1"><span class="nm">(g)</span><span class="cl">Answer:</span> They would leave, but they would not kick the Sukah.</p>
<p class="bas indent1"><span class="nm">(h)</span>"Yoshev ba'Shamayim Yischak" - Hash-m will laugh at them.</p>
<p class="bas indent1"><span class="nm">(i)</span><span class="cl">Version #1 (R. Yitzchak):</span> That is the only day of Hash-m's laughter.</p>
<p class="bas indent1"><span class="nm">(j)</span><span class="cl">Version #2:</span> R. Yitzchak said this in response to the following.</p>
<p class="bas indent1"><span class="nm">(k)</span><span class="cl">(Beraisa - R. Yosi):</span> In the future, Nochrim will convert.</p>
<p class="bas indent1"><span class="nm">(l)</span><span class="cl">Question:</span> We should not accept them!</p>
<p class="bas indent2"><span class="nm">1.</span><span class="cl">(Beraisa):</span> We will not accept converts in the Messianic days (lest their motives are insincere);</p>
<p class="bas indent2"><span class="nm">2.</span>Similarly, we did not accept converts in the days of David and Shlomo.</p>
<p class="bas indent1"><span class="nm">(m)</span><span class="cl">Answer:</span> Rather, the Nochrim convert by themselves (which is invalid), put Tefilin on their heads and arms, and Tzitzis on their garments, and Mezuzos on their doors;</p>
<p class="bas indent2"><span class="nm">1.</span>When they see the armies of Gog and Magog, the converts (text of the Rashash) ask them why they came.</p>
<p class="bas indent2"><span class="nm">2.</span><span class="cl">Gog and Magog:</span> "(We gathered to fight) Al Hash-m v'Al Meshicho."</p>
<p class="bas indent2"><span class="nm">3.</span>The converts cast off their Mitzvos and leave - "Nenatkah Es Moseroseimu..."</p>
<p class="bas indent1"><span class="nm">(n)</span>"Yoshev ba'Shamayim Yischak (Hash-m will laugh at them)."</p>
<p class="bas indent1"><span class="nm">(o)</span><span class="cl">(R. Yitzchak):</span> That is the only day of Hash-m's laughter.</p>
<p class="bas subject"><span class="nm">3)</span>HOW HASH-M DIVIDES HIS DAY</p>
<p class="bas indent1"><span class="nm">(a)</span><span class="cl">Question (on both versions):</span> Rav Yehudah taught that Hash-m laughs every day!</p>
<p class="bas indent2"><span class="nm">1.</span><span class="cl">(Rav Yehudah):</span> In the first three hours of the day(time), Hash-m engages in Torah;</p>
<p class="bas indent2"><span class="nm">2.</span>The next three hours He judges the world;</p>
<p class="bas indent3"><span class="nm">i.</span>When He sees that the world is proper to be destroyed, He goes from the throne of judgment the throne of mercy.</p>
<p class="bas indent2"><span class="nm">3.</span>The next three hours He feeds the entire world, from the biggest animals to the smallest (lice eggs);</p>
<p class="bas indent2"><span class="nm">4.</span>The last three hours He laughs with Livyasan (a giant fish that Tzadikim will enjoy in the future) - "Livyasan Zeh Yatzarta Lesachek Bo."</p>
<p class="bas indent1"><span class="nm">(b)</span><span class="cl">Answer #1 (Rav Nachman bar Yitzchak):</span> He regularly laughs <i>with</i> His creations, but he does not laugh at His creations except for that day.</p>
<p class="bas indent1"><span class="nm">(c)</span><span class="cl">Answer #2 (Rav Acha):</span> He does not laugh after the Mikdash was destroyed.</p>
<p class="bas indent1"><span class="nm">(d)</span><span class="cl">Question:</span> What is the source for this?</p>
<p class="bas indent2"><span class="nm">1.</span><span class="cl">Suggestion:</span> "Va'Yikra Hash-m... ba'Yom Hahu li'Vchi ul'Misped ul'Karchah."</p>
<p class="bas indent2"><span class="nm">2.</span><span class="cl">Rejection:</span> Perhaps He declared only the day of the Churban for crying!</p>
<p class="bas indent1"><span class="nm">(e)</span><span class="cl">Answer #1:</span> We learn from "Im Eshkachech Yerushalayim... Im Lo Ezkerechi."</p>
<p class="bas indent1"><span class="nm">(f)</span><span class="cl">Rejection:</span> Perhaps He does not forget, but He does laugh!</p>
<p class="bas indent1"><span class="nm">(g)</span><span class="cl">Answer #2:</span> "Hechesheisi me'Olam Acharish Esapak..."</p>
<p class="bas indent1"><span class="nm">(h)</span><span class="cl">Question:</span> (According to Rav Acha, Hash-m does not laugh after the Churban.) What does He do during the last three hours?</p>
<p class="bas indent1"><span class="nm">(i)</span><span class="cl">Answer:</span> He teaches children who died - "Yoreh De'ah... Gemulei me'Chalav."</p>
<p class="bas indent1"><span class="nm">(j)</span><span class="cl">Question:</span> Who teaches them the first three quarters of the day?</p>
<p class="bas indent1"><span class="nm">(k)</span><span class="cl">Answer #1:</span> Metatron (the angel appointed over the world) teaches them.</p>
<p class="bas indent1"><span class="nm">(l)</span><span class="cl">Answer #2:</span> Until then, Hash-m teaches them in addition to engaging in Torah, judging or feeding the world.</p>
<p class="bas indent1"><span class="nm">(m)</span><span class="cl">Question:</span> What does Hash-m do at night?</p>
<p class="bas indent1"><span class="nm">(n)</span><span class="cl">Answer #1:</span> He does the same things that He does during the day.</p>
<p class="bas indent1"><span class="nm">(o)</span><span class="cl">Answer #2:</span> He rides on a fast Cheruv (angel) and flies through 18,000 worlds - "Rechev Elokim Ribosayim Alfei Shin'an";</p>
<p class="bas indent2"><span class="nm">1.</span>We read this like 'she'Einen' (2000 of the 20,000 are lacking).</p>
<p class="bas indent1"><span class="nm">(p)</span><span class="cl">Answer #3:</span> He listens to the Chayos (angels) singing - "uva'Laylah Shiro Imi."</p>
<p class="bas subject"><span class="nm">4)</span>REWARD AND PUNISHMENT FOR LEARNING AND NEGLECTING TORAH</p>
<p class="bas indent1"><span class="nm">(a)</span><span class="cl">(R. Levi):</span> Anyone who stops learning to speak idle words, he is (force-)fed burning coals - "ha'Kotefim Malu'ach Alei Si'ach v'Shoresh Resamim Lachmam."</p>
<p class="bas indent1"><span class="nm">(b)</span><span class="cl">Version #1 (Reish Lakish):</span> If one engages in Torah at night, Hash-m bestows grace on him during the day - "Yomam Yetzaveh Hash-m Chasdo uva'Laylah Shiro Imi";</p>
<p class="bas indent2"><span class="nm">1.</span>Hash-m commands His Chesed upon him during the day <i>because</i> he learned at night.</p>
<p class="bas indent1"><span class="nm">(c)</span><span class="cl">Version #2 (Reish Lakish):</span> If one engages in Torah in this world, which resembles night, Hash-m bestows grace on him in the world to come, which resembles day - "Yomam Yetzaveh Hash-m Chasdo..."</p>
<p class="bas indent1"><span class="nm">(d)</span><span class="cl">Question (Rav Yehudah):</span> "Va'Ta'aseh Adam ki'Dgei ha'Yam" - why are people compared to fish?</p>
<p class="bas indent1"><span class="nm">(e)</span><span class="cl">Answer #1:</span> Just like fish die immediately if they come upon dry land, also people die immediately if they refrain from Torah and Mitzvos.</p>
<p class="bas indent1"><span class="nm">(f)</span><span class="cl">Answer #2:</span> Just like fish die if the sun beats upon them, also people.</p>
<p class="bas indent2"><span class="nm">1.</span>Some say that this refers to this world, like R. Chanina taught;</p>
<p class="bas indent3"><span class="nm">i.</span><span class="cl">(R. Chanina):</span> All sicknesses are decreed by Heaven, except for chills and fevers (which are due to one's negligence).</p>
<p class="bas indent2"><span class="nm">2.</span>Some say that it refers to the world to come, like Reish Lakish taught.</p>
<p class="bas indent3"><span class="nm">i.</span><span class="cl">(Reish Lakish):</span> Gehinom is not a separate place. Rather, Hash-m will let the sun beat down heavily. The wicked are judged (punished) through this, and Tzadikim are cured through this.</p>
