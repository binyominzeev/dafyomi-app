<p class="bas subject"><span class="nm">1)</span>WHY THE ENACTMENT WAS MADE (cont.)</p>
<p class="bas indent1"><span class="nm">(a)</span><span class="cl">Question (Mishnah):</span> If one found a Tachrich or Agudah of documents, he returns them.</p>
<p class="bas indent2"><span class="nm">1.</span>The borrower does not want the lender to receive the documents through a Siman!</p>
<p class="bas indent1"><span class="nm">(b)</span><span class="cl">Retraction (Rava):</span> Rather, Simanim are mid'Oraisa.</p>
<p class="bas indent2"><span class="nm">1.</span><span class="cl">(Beraisa) Question:</span> "It will be with you until Derosh Achicha." Would one have thought to return it before this?!</p>
<p class="bas indent2"><span class="nm">2.</span>Rather, this teaches that you must be Doresh (investigate) if he is lying, by asking him for a Siman.</p>
<p class="bas subject"><span class="nm">2)</span>COMPETING <i>SIMANIM</i></p>
<p class="bas indent1"><span class="nm">(a)</span><span class="cl">(Rava):</span> If you will say that Simanim are mid'Oraisa...</p>
<p class="bas indent2"><span class="nm">1.</span><span class="cl">Interjection:</span> Rava just proved that Simanim are mid'Oraisa!</p>
<p class="bas indent2"><span class="nm">2.</span><span class="cl">Answer:</span> One could reject the proof like above; he must bring witnesses testifying that it is his.</p>
<p class="bas indent1"><span class="nm">(b)</span><span class="cl">(Continuation - Rava):</span> If Simanim are mid'Oraisa, if Reuven and Shimon each give Simanim of an Aveidah, we leave it until Eliyahu comes;</p>
<p class="bas indent2"><span class="nm">1.</span>If Reuven gives Simanim and witnesses say that it is Shimon's, Shimon gets it;</p>
<p class="bas indent2"><span class="nm">2.</span>If Reuven and Shimon each give Simanim, and one witness supports Shimon, the witness does nothing. We leave it;</p>
<p class="bas indent2"><span class="nm">3.</span>If two witnesses say that Reuven wove a garment, and two witnesses say that it fell from Shimon, we assume that Shimon bought it, so he gets it;</p>
<p class="bas indent2"><span class="nm">4.</span>If Reuven knows the length and Shimon knows the width, Reuven gets it, for one can estimate its width when he sees another wear it, but not its length;</p>
<p class="bas indent2"><span class="nm">5.</span>If Reuven knows the length and width, and Shimon knows the sum of its length and width, Reuven gets it;</p>
<p class="bas indent2"><span class="nm">6.</span>If Reuven knows the length and width, and Shimon knows the weight, Shimon gets it;</p>
<p class="bas indent2"><span class="nm">7.</span>If Reuven and his wife both give Simanim on a Get (for her), she gets it (he surely knows. She would only know if she received it.)</p>
<p class="bas indent2"><span class="nm">8.</span><span class="cl">Question:</span> What Simanim did she give?</p>
<p class="bas indent3"><span class="nm">i.</span>The length and width is not a proper  Siman. Perhaps she saw it in his hands!</p>
<p class="bas indent2"><span class="nm">9.</span><span class="cl">Answer:</span> Rather, there is a hole near a particular letter.</p>
<p class="bas indent2"><span class="nm">10.</span>If Reuven and his wife both give Simanim on the string holding the Get, she gets it.</p>
<p class="bas indent2"><span class="nm">11.</span><span class="cl">Question:</span> What Simanim did she give?</p>
<p class="bas indent3"><span class="nm">i.</span>The color is not a proper  Siman. Perhaps she saw it in his hands!</p>
<p class="bas indent2"><span class="nm">12.</span><span class="cl">Answer:</span> Rather, she gave the length.</p>
<p class="bas indent2"><span class="nm">13.</span>If Reuven and his wife both say that the Get was in a pouch, he gets it.</p>
<p class="bas indent2"><span class="nm">14.</span><span class="cl">Question:</span> What is the reason?</p>
<p class="bas indent2"><span class="nm">15.</span><span class="cl">Answer:</span> She knows that he puts all his things in his pouch.</p>
<p class="bas subject"><span class="nm">3)</span>ANNOUNCING AN <i>AVEIDAH</i></p>
<p class="bas indent1"><span class="nm">(a)</span><span class="cl">(Mishnah - R. Meir):</span> One must announce until the neighbors hear;</p>
<p class="bas indent1"><span class="nm">(b)</span>R. Yehudah says, he must announce for three festivals, and seven days after the third festival;</p>
<p class="bas indent2"><span class="nm">1.</span>The seven days allow someone to return home in three days, check if he lost it, return in three days and claim the object on the seventh day.</p>
<p class="bas indent1"><span class="nm">(c)</span><span class="cl">(Gemara - Beraisa):</span> Neighbors of the Aveidah (must hear).</p>
<p class="bas indent1"><span class="nm">(d)</span><span class="cl">Question:</span> To which neighbors does this refer?</p>
<p class="bas indent2"><span class="nm">1.</span><span class="cl">Suggestion:</span> If refers to neighbors of the owner.</p>
<p class="bas indent2"><span class="nm">2.</span><span class="cl">Rejection:</span> If the finder knows the owner, he should give it to him!</p>
<p class="bas indent1"><span class="nm">(e)</span><span class="cl">Answer:</span> Rather, it is neighbors of the place where he found it.</p>
<p class="bas indent1"><span class="nm">(f)</span><span class="cl">(Mishnah):</span> R. Yehudah says... (three days to return home...)</p>
<p class="bas indent1"><span class="nm">(g)</span><span class="cl">Contradiction (Mishnah):</span> We start requesting rain (in prayer) on the third of Cheshvan;</p>
<p class="bas indent2"><span class="nm">1.</span>R. Gamliel says, we begin on the seventh. We do not want rain while people are returning home (from Yerushalayim) after the end of Sukos, After 15 days, the last travelers have reached the Peras River (the end of Eretz Yisrael).</p>
<p class="bas indent1"><span class="nm">(h)</span><span class="cl">Answer #1 (Rav Yosef):</span> Fifteen days were allotted during the first Mikdash, for there were more people - "Yehudah and Yisrael were numerous like the sand at the sea (shore)";</p>
<p class="bas indent2"><span class="nm">1.</span>Three days sufficed during the second Mikdash, for there were few people - "the whole Tzibur, 44,360."</p>
<p class="bas indent1"><span class="nm">(i)</span><span class="cl">Objection (and Answer #2 - Abaye):</span> Just the contrary! "V'Chol Yisrael b'Areihem" - they lived in the same cities in Bayis Sheni as in Bayis Rishon (so there is no reason to allow <i>less</i> time);</p>
<p class="bas indent2"><span class="nm">1.</span>In the first Mikdash, there were more people, so they could travel day and night in caravans. Three days sufficed;</p>
<p class="bas indent2"><span class="nm">2.</span>In the second Mikdash, caravans were harder to find, so 15 days were needed. (It was more than twice as long, for people would stop early, lest they not find a good place to lodge before dark. E.g. if Chasidim Rishonim spent three hours for each of Shacharis, Minchah and Ma'ariv, they could travel 15 hours a day in Bayis Rishon, and only three hours a day in Bayis Sheni if they stopped traveling at midday.)</p>
<p class="bas indent1"><span class="nm">(j)</span><span class="cl">Answer #3 (Rava):</span> In each Mikdash, the last people needed 15 days;</p>
<p class="bas indent2"><span class="nm">1.</span>Chachamim did not burden finders to wait more than seven days.</p>
<p class="bas indent1"><span class="nm">(k)</span><span class="cl">Inference (Ravina):</span> This teaches that the finder would announce the object he found, e.g. 'a cloak';</p>
<p class="bas indent2"><span class="nm">1.</span>If he would merely announce 'an Aveidah', another day would be needed for the (possible) losers to check if they lost anything.</p>
<p class="bas indent1"><span class="nm">(l)</span><span class="cl">Rejection (Rava):</span> Perhaps he merely announced 'an Aveidah.' Chachamim did not burden finders to wait another day.</p>
<p class="bas indent1"><span class="nm">(m)</span><span class="cl">(Beraisa):</span> On the first festival, he announces 'this is the first festival (of announcement).' On the second he says 'second festival'; on the third, he does not mention which festival it is (so people will know that it is the last festival).</p>
<p class="bas indent1"><span class="nm">(n)</span><span class="cl">Question:</span> He should explicitly say 'third festival' (people know the law)!</p>
<p class="bas indent1"><span class="nm">(o)</span><span class="cl">Answer:</span> People might mistakenly think that he said 'second'.</p>
<p class="bas indent1"><span class="nm">(p)</span><span class="cl">Question:</span> Also regarding the second, they may think he said 'first'!</p>
<p class="bas bbbline">28b----------------------------------------28b</p>
<p class="bas indent1"><span class="nm">(q)</span><span class="cl">Answer:</span> In any case, he will come the next festival and hear the announcement (and know that this is the last time).</p>
<p class="bas subject"><span class="nm">4)</span>THE ENACTMENT</p>
<p class="bas indent1"><span class="nm">(a)</span><span class="cl">(Beraisa):</span> At first, the finder would announce for three festivals, and seven days after the last festival;</p>
<p class="bas indent2"><span class="nm">1.</span>One could go home and return in six days, and claim his object on the seventh day.</p>
<p class="bas indent2"><span class="nm">2.</span>After the Churban, it was enacted to announce in Batei Kenesiyos and Batei Medrash;</p>
<p class="bas indent2"><span class="nm">3.</span>After Anasim increased, it was enacted to inform (the finder's) neighbors and acquaintances, and this suffices.</p>
<p class="bas indent1"><span class="nm">(b)</span><span class="cl">Question:</span> What are the Anasim?</p>
<p class="bas indent1"><span class="nm">(c)</span><span class="cl">Answer:</span> They are people who say that Aveidos belong to the king.</p>
<p class="bas indent1"><span class="nm">(d)</span>R. Ami found a Kli of gold coins. A man noticed that R. Ami was very nervous. He comforted him 'I am not a Persian. They say that Aveidos belong to the king.'</p>
<p class="bas indent1"><span class="nm">(e)</span><span class="cl">(Beraisa):</span> There was a 'rock of claimers' in Yerushalayim where finders would announce and losers would give Simanim.</p>
<p class="bas subject"><span class="nm">5)</span>TO WHOM WE RETURN</p>
<p class="bas indent1"><span class="nm">(a)</span><span class="cl">(Mishnah):</span> If the loser said what he lost but did not give a Siman, he does not get it;</p>
<p class="bas indent2"><span class="nm">1.</span>We do not return to a swindler, even if he gives a Siman  - "Ad Derosh Achicha (until your brother demands it)" - you must be Doresh (investigate) whether or not he is a swindler.</p>
<p class="bas indent1"><span class="nm">(b)</span><span class="cl">(Gemara - Rav Yehudah):</span> The finder announces only 'I found an Aveidah.'</p>
<p class="bas indent1"><span class="nm">(c)</span><span class="cl">(Rav Nachman):</span> He announces what was found, e.g. a cloak.</p>
<p class="bas indent1"><span class="nm">(d)</span><span class="cl">(Rav Yehudah):</span> If he announces what he found, we must be concerned for swindlers!</p>
<p class="bas indent1"><span class="nm">(e)</span><span class="cl">(Rav Nachman):</span> We are not concerned for swindlers. If we would be, even if we announced 'Aveidah' we should be concerned lest he will guess what it is!</p>
<p class="bas indent1"><span class="nm">(f)</span><span class="cl">Question (against Rav Nachman - Mishnah):</span> If the loser said what he lost but did not give a sign, he does not get it.</p>
<p class="bas indent2"><span class="nm">1.</span>If he only announces 'an Aveidah', this is a Chidush. Even though the loser knew what was lost, he does not get it.</p>
<p class="bas indent2"><span class="nm">2.</span>But if he announces what was lost, the loser said nothing more than he heard. Obviously, he does not get it!</p>
<p class="bas indent1"><span class="nm">(g)</span><span class="cl">Answer (Rav Safra):</span> He did not say good Simanim, but he said poor Simanim.</p>
<p class="bas indent1"><span class="nm">(h)</span><span class="cl">(Beraisa):</span> At first, the loser would give the Simanim and receive the object. After swindlers increased, it was enacted that he must bring witnesses that he is not a swindler.</p>
<p class="bas indent2"><span class="nm">1.</span>Rav Papa's father lost a donkey. It was found. Rabah bar Rav Huna asked him to bring witnesses that he is not a swindler.</p>
<p class="bas indent2"><span class="nm">2.</span><span class="cl">Rabah bar Rav Huna:</span> Do you know that he is a swindler?</p>
<p class="bas indent2"><span class="nm">3.</span><span class="cl">The witnesses:</span> Yes.</p>
<p class="bas indent2"><span class="nm">4.</span><span class="cl">Rav Papa's father:</span> You say that I am a swindler?!</p>
<p class="bas indent2"><span class="nm">5.</span><span class="cl">The witnesses:</span> We meant that we know you are <i>not</i> a swindler!</p>
<p class="bas indent2"><span class="nm">6.</span><span class="cl">Rabah bar Rav Huna:</span> Presumably, the witnesses meant that from the beginning. One does not bring witnesses who will incriminate him.</p>
<p class="bas subject"><span class="nm">6)</span>HOW LONG DOES THE FINDER KEEP THE <i>METZI'AH</i>?</p>
<p class="bas indent1"><span class="nm">(a)</span><span class="cl">(Mishnah):</span> If one found something that works and eats (no more than the value of its labor, e.g. an ox), the finder should use it and feed it;</p>
<p class="bas indent1"><span class="nm">(b)</span>If one found something that eats and does not work, it should be sold - "v'Hashevoso Lo", be careful to return it properly. (Do not keep the animal and deduct what it eats until the loser claims it.)</p>
<p class="bas indent1"><span class="nm">(c)</span>R. Tarfon says, the finder may use the money from the sale (until the loser claims it). Therefore, if it is lost, he is liable;</p>
<p class="bas indent1"><span class="nm">(d)</span>R. Akiva says, the finder may not use the money. Therefore, if it is lost, he is exempt.</p>
<p class="bas indent1"><span class="nm">(e)</span><span class="cl">(Gemara) Question:</span> (If something works and eats,) must the finder guard it forever?!</p>
<p class="bas indent1"><span class="nm">(f)</span><span class="cl">Answer (Rav Nachman):</span> He guards it for only 12 months.</p>
<p class="bas indent1"><span class="nm">(g)</span><span class="cl">Support (Beraisa):</span> If something works and eats, e.g. a cow or donkey, the finder keeps it for 12 months. After that, he sells it and guards the money;</p>
<p class="bas indent2"><span class="nm">1.</span>If something eats and does not work, e.g. calves and young donkeys, the finder keeps it for three months. After that, he sells it and guards the money;</p>
<p class="bas indent2"><span class="nm">2.</span>If one found geese or (male) chickens, he keeps them for 30 days. After that, he sells it and guards the money.</p>
<p class="bas indent1"><span class="nm">(h)</span><span class="cl">(Rav Nachman bar Yitzchak):</span> A hen (because it gives eggs) is like a work animal (he guards it for 12 months).</p>
<p class="bas indent1"><span class="nm">(i)</span><span class="cl">Support (Beraisa):</span> If one found a hen or a work animal, he keeps it for 12 months. After that, he sells it and guards the money;</p>
<p class="bas indent2"><span class="nm">1.</span>If one found a calf or young donkey, he keeps it for 30 days. After that, he sells it and guards the money;</p>
<p class="bas indent2"><span class="nm">2.</span>If one found a goose or rooster, or anything expensive to care for, he keeps it for three days. After that, he sells it and guards the money.</p>
<p class="bas indent1"><span class="nm">(j)</span><span class="cl">Contradiction:</span> The Beraisos argue about calves and young donkeys, and geese and roosters!</p>
<p class="bas indent1"><span class="nm">(k)</span><span class="cl">Answer - part 1:</span> For calves and young donkeys, in a time and place where they can eat grass in the pasture, he keeps them for three months. If he must feed them, he keeps them for 30 days;</p>
<p class="bas indent1"><span class="nm">(l)</span><span class="cl">Version #1 (Rashi) Answer - part 2:</span> One keeps big geese and roosters (they eat a lot) for three days. He keeps small ones for 30 days.</p>
<p class="bas indent1"><span class="nm">(m)</span><span class="cl">Version #2 (Rambam) Answer - part 2:</span> One keeps big geese and roosters (they can find their own food) for 30 days. He keeps small ones for three days. (end of Version #2)</p>
<p class="bas indent1"><span class="nm">(n)</span><span class="cl">(Beraisa):</span> "V'Hashevoso Lo" - be careful how you return it. Do not let calves, young donkeys, geese and roosters consume their value.</p>
