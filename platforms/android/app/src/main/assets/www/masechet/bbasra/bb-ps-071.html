<p class="bas subject"><span class="nm">1)</span>WHAT IS INCLUDED WITH  A FIELD</p>
<p class="bas indent1"><span class="nm">(a)</span><span class="cl">(Mishnah - R. Akiva):</span> (If one sells a field,) he does not sell the pit, winery or dovecote, whether these are barren or full. He must buy a path to them;</p>
<p class="bas indent1"><span class="nm">(b)</span>Chachamim say, he need not buy a path;</p>
<p class="bas indent2"><span class="nm">1.</span>R. Akiva admits that if he said 'except for these', he need not buy a path.</p>
<p class="bas indent1"><span class="nm">(c)</span>R. Akiva says, if Reuven sold his field to Shimon, and the pit, winery or dovecote to Levi, Levi need not buy a path;</p>
<p class="bas indent1"><span class="nm">(d)</span>Chachamim say, he must buy a path.</p>
<p class="bas indent1"><span class="nm">(e)</span>This refers to one who sells, but one who gives a gift gives all of them.</p>
<p class="bas indent1"><span class="nm">(f)</span>Brothers who divide an inheritance acquire all of these with a field.</p>
<p class="bas indent1"><span class="nm">(g)</span>If one makes Chazakah to acquire a (Hefker) field of a convert (who died without heirs), he acquires all of them.</p>
<p class="bas indent1"><span class="nm">(h)</span>If one is Makdish a field (gives it to Hekdesh), they all become Hekdesh;</p>
<p class="bas indent1"><span class="nm">(i)</span>R. Shimon says, (of all these things,) only grafted carob and sycamore stumps are Hekdesh.</p>
<p class="bas subject"><span class="nm">2)</span>ONE GIVES GENEROUSLY</p>
<p class="bas indent1"><span class="nm">(a)</span><span class="cl">(Gemara) Question:</span> Why is a sale different than a gift?</p>
<p class="bas indent1"><span class="nm">(b)</span><span class="cl">Answer (Yehudah ben Nekusa):</span> The giver explicitly said that he gives all. The seller did not.</p>
<p class="bas indent1"><span class="nm">(c)</span><span class="cl">Objection:</span> Neither of them was explicit!</p>
<p class="bas indent1"><span class="nm">(d)</span><span class="cl">Answer:</span> Rather, the giver did not need to be explicit (all know that one gives generously). The seller needed to be explicit (normally, one sells stingily).</p>
<p class="bas indent1"><span class="nm">(e)</span>Reuven said 'give to Ploni a house that can hold 100 barrels', and it was found that Reuven owns a house that holds 120.</p>
<p class="bas indent1"><span class="nm">(f)</span><span class="cl">(Mar Zutra):</span> Reuven wanted to give a house holding 100 barrels, but not a bigger house.</p>
<p class="bas indent1"><span class="nm">(g)</span><span class="cl">Objection (Rav Ashi - Mishnah):</span> This refers to one who sells, but one who gives a gift gives all of them.</p>
<p class="bas indent2"><span class="nm">1.</span><span class="cl">Inference:</span> One gives generously;</p>
<p class="bas indent2"><span class="nm">2.</span>Also here, Reuven gives generously, he is happy for Ploni to get a bigger house!</p>
<p class="bas subject"><span class="nm">3)</span>KEEPING LAND FOR TREES</p>
<p class="bas indent1"><span class="nm">(a)</span><span class="cl">(Mishnah):</span> If one is Makdish a field, they all become Hekdesh.</p>
<p class="bas indent1"><span class="nm">(b)</span><span class="cl">(Rav Huna):</span> Even though if Reuven buys two trees in Shimon's property, he does not acquire land with them (between or around them, or the right to plant others if these will die or dry up), if Reuven sold his property and kept two trees for himself, he keeps land with them.</p>
<p class="bas indent2"><span class="nm">1.</span>Even R. Akiva says that one sells generously only regarding pits and cisterns, which endure;</p>
<p class="bas indent2"><span class="nm">2.</span>Trees weaken. If he would not retain land, the buyer could tell him 'uproot your trees and leave' (when they dry up).</p>
<p class="bas bbbline">71b----------------------------------------71b</p>
<p class="bas indent1"><span class="nm">(c)</span><span class="cl">(Mishnah - R. Shimon):</span> Of all these things, only grafted carob and sycamore stumps are Hekdesh. (Other trees are also Hekdesh, they are even included in a sale.)</p>
<p class="bas indent1"><span class="nm">(d)</span><span class="cl">(Beraisa - R. Shimon):</span> This is because they nurture from the surrounding Hekdesh land. (He does not want to benefit from Hekdesh.)</p>
<p class="bas indent1"><span class="nm">(e)</span><span class="cl">Question (against Rav Huna):</span> If one leaves land for his trees, they nurture from his own property!</p>
<p class="bas indent1"><span class="nm">(f)</span><span class="cl">Answer #1:</span> R. Shimon holds like R. Akiva (that one sells generously. Likewise, one is Makdish generously). Rav Huna's law is like Chachamim (one sells stingily. We retracted from what we said above, that Rav Huna's law is even like R. Akiva. Another answer will be given on Daf 72b.)</p>
<p class="bas indent1"><span class="nm">(g)</span><span class="cl">Objection:</span> Chachamim say that one keeps a path to his pit. We need not say that he keeps land for his trees! (If Rav Huna does not teach even according to R. Akiva, what is his Chidush?)</p>
<p class="bas indent1"><span class="nm">(h)</span><span class="cl">Answer:</span> He teaches that if they fall, he may plant new trees.</p>
