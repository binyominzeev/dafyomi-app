<p class="bas subject"><span class="nm">1)</span>THE <i>KORBANOS</i> FOR FALSE OATHS</p>
<p class="bas indent1"><span class="nm">(a)</span><span class="cl">(R. Yirmiyah):</span> (In the setting of the Mishnah, if the renter and borrower swore falsely and later repented -) sometimes each brings a Korban Chatas. Sometimes each brings an Asham. Sometimes the renter brings a Chatas and the borrower brings an Asham, and sometimes vice-versa.</p>
<p class="bas indent2"><span class="nm">1.</span>For a false oath that denies money, one brings an Asham. For a false oath of Bituy (utterance, that does not deny money) he brings a sin-offering.</p>
<p class="bas indent1"><span class="nm">(b)</span>Each brings a Chatas, e.g. it died normally, and they swore that it died through Ones;</p>
<p class="bas indent2"><span class="nm">1.</span>Even had they sworn truthfully, the law would be the same. The renter is exempt, and the borrower is liable.</p>
<p class="bas indent1"><span class="nm">(c)</span>Each brings an Asham, e.g. it was stolen, and they swore that it died while working;</p>
<p class="bas indent2"><span class="nm">1.</span>Really, each is liable. By swearing falsely, they exempted themselves.</p>
<p class="bas indent1"><span class="nm">(d)</span>The renter brings a Chatas and the borrower brings an Asham, e.g. it died normally, and they swore that it died while working;</p>
<p class="bas indent2"><span class="nm">1.</span>Really, the renter is exempt, and the borrower is liable. By swearing falsely, the borrower exempted himself.</p>
<p class="bas indent1"><span class="nm">(e)</span>The renter brings an Asham and the borrower brings a Chatas, e.g. it was stolen, and they swore that it died normally;</p>
<p class="bas indent2"><span class="nm">1.</span>Really, each is liable. By swearing falsely, the renter exempted himself.</p>
<p class="bas indent1"><span class="nm">(f)</span><span class="cl">Question:</span> What Chidush did R. Yirmiyah come to teach?</p>
<p class="bas indent1"><span class="nm">(g)</span><span class="cl">Answer:</span> He teaches unlike R. Ami, who says that any oath administered by Beis Din is not considered an oath of Bituy for which one brings a Chatas.</p>
<p class="bas indent2"><span class="nm">1.</span>R. Ami learns from "Ki Sishava (when will swear)." This connotes that he himself chose to swear.</p>
<p class="bas subject"><span class="nm">2)</span>A <i>SHOMER</i> WHO GAVE TO A <i>SHOMER</i></p>
<p class="bas indent1"><span class="nm">(a)</span><span class="cl">(Rav):</span> If Reuven was guarding a deposit, and he gave it to another Shomer, Reuven is exempt;</p>
<p class="bas indent1"><span class="nm">(b)</span><span class="cl">(R. Yochanan):</span> He is liable.</p>
<p class="bas indent1"><span class="nm">(c)</span><span class="cl">(Abaye):</span> Rav's law is not only when a Shomer Chinam gave it to a Shomer Sachar, who guards it better (he is liable for theft and loss);</p>
<p class="bas indent2"><span class="nm">1.</span>Rather, even if a Shomer Sachar gave it to a Shomer Chinam, who does not guard it as well, he is exempt.</p>
<p class="bas indent1"><span class="nm">(d)</span><span class="cl">Question:</span> What is the reason?</p>
<p class="bas indent1"><span class="nm">(e)</span><span class="cl">Answer:</span> He gives it to one with intellect.</p>
<p class="bas indent1"><span class="nm">(f)</span><span class="cl">(Abaye):</span> R. Yochanan's law is not only when a Shomer Sachar gave it to a Shomer Chinam, who does not guard as well;</p>
<p class="bas indent2"><span class="nm">1.</span>Rather, even if a Shomer Chinam gave it to a Shomer Sachar, who guards it better, he is liable.</p>
<p class="bas indent1"><span class="nm">(g)</span><span class="cl">Question:</span> What is the reason?</p>
<p class="bas indent1"><span class="nm">(h)</span><span class="cl">Answer:</span> The owner does not want others handling his object.</p>
<p class="bas indent1"><span class="nm">(i)</span><span class="cl">(Rav Chisda):</span> Rav did not say his law explicitly, rather it was inferred from the following episode.</p>
<p class="bas indent2"><span class="nm">1.</span>There were some gardeners who used to deposit their hoes with a certain woman. One day, they left them by Reuven (one of the gardeners). He heard a wedding, and left them with her. They were stolen. Rav exempted Reuven.</p>
<p class="bas indent2"><span class="nm">2.</span>The one who heard this ruling inferred that Rav (normally) exempts a Shomer who gave to another Shomer is exempt. This is wrong!</p>
<p class="bas indent3"><span class="nm">i.</span>Rather, because they always deposited their hoes with her, they showed that they consent for her to guard them.</p>
<p class="bas indent1"><span class="nm">(j)</span><span class="cl">Question (against R. Yochanan - R. Aba bar Mamal - Mishnah):</span> If Reuven rented Shimon's cow, and lent it to Levi, and it died normally, Reuven swears that it died normally, and Levi pays Reuven.</p>
<p class="bas indent2"><span class="nm">1.</span>We do not say that (Reuven is liable because) Shimon does not want others handling his object!</p>
<p class="bas indent1"><span class="nm">(k)</span><span class="cl">Answer (R. Ami):</span> The case is, Shimon permitted Reuven to lend the cow.</p>
<p class="bas indent1"><span class="nm">(l)</span><span class="cl">Question:</span> If so, it is as if Levi borrowed from Shimon. He should pay Shimon!</p>
<p class="bas indent1"><span class="nm">(m)</span><span class="cl">Answer:</span> Shimon told Reuven 'if you want to lend the cow, that is your decision.'</p>
<p class="bas indent1"><span class="nm">(n)</span><span class="cl">Question (Rami bar Chama - Mishnah):</span> If Shimon deposited coins with Reuven, and Reuven wrapped them and carried them (hanging) over his back, or gave them to his children (minors) to guard, or locked them up inadequately, he is liable, for people do not guard like this.</p>
<p class="bas indent2"><span class="nm">1.</span><span class="cl">Inference:</span> If his children were adults, he would be exempt. We do not say that Shimon does not want others handling his coins!</p>
<p class="bas indent1"><span class="nm">(o)</span><span class="cl">Answer (Rava):</span> One who deposits expects that the Shomer will entrust the deposit with (adult) members of the Shomer's family.</p>
<p class="bas bbbline">36b----------------------------------------36b</p>
<p class="bas indent1"><span class="nm">(p)</span><span class="cl">Support (Chachamim of Neharda'a- Mishnah):</span> He gave them to his children (minors);</p>
<p class="bas indent2"><span class="nm">1.</span><span class="cl">Inference:</span> If his children were adults, he would be exempt. This distinction applies only to his own children. If he gave to other people, children or adults, he would be liable!</p>
<p class="bas indent2"><span class="nm">2.</span>If the distinction between children and adults always applied, it should just say 'he gave to children'!</p>
<p class="bas indent1"><span class="nm">(q)</span><span class="cl">(Rava):</span> The Halachah is, not only a Shomer Sachar who gave to a Shomer Chinam (who does not guard as well) is liable, rather, even a Shomer Chinam who gave to a Shomer Sachar (who guards it better) is liable;</p>
<p class="bas indent2"><span class="nm">1.</span>The reason is, the owner can say that he trusts the oath of the first Shomer, but not of the second.</p>
<p class="bas subject"><span class="nm">3)</span>THE BEGINNING WAS NEGLIGENCE AND THE END WAS <i>ONES</i></p>
<p class="bas indent1"><span class="nm">(a)</span><span class="cl">(Abaye citing Rabah):</span> If Reuven was negligent with the animal he was guarding, and it went to the swamp (where it is not guarded), and died normally, he is liable.</p>
<p class="bas indent1"><span class="nm">(b)</span><span class="cl">(Rava citing Rabah):</span> He is exempt.</p>
<p class="bas indent1"><span class="nm">(c)</span><span class="cl">Abaye:</span> He is liable not only according to the opinion that obligates when the beginning was negligence and the end was Ones. Rather, even the opinion that exempts in that case obligates in this case;</p>
<p class="bas indent2"><span class="nm">1.</span>(Perhaps) the hot air of the swamp caused the death. It died due to the negligence.</p>
<p class="bas indent1"><span class="nm">(d)</span><span class="cl">Rava:</span> He is exempt not only according to the opinion that exempts when the beginning was negligence and the end was Ones. Rather, even the opinion that obligates in that case exempts in this case;</p>
<p class="bas indent2"><span class="nm">1.</span>The angel of death would have killed it no matter where it was.</p>
<p class="bas indent1"><span class="nm">(e)</span>Abaye admits that if he returned it to the owner's house (after being negligent, and it died there) he is exempt. The hot air of the swamp did not cause the death.</p>
<p class="bas indent1"><span class="nm">(f)</span>Rava admits that if it was stolen from the swamp and died in the thief's house, Reuven is liable.</p>
<p class="bas indent1"><span class="nm">(g)</span><span class="cl">Question:</span> What is the reason?</p>
<p class="bas indent1"><span class="nm">(h)</span><span class="cl">Answer:</span> Even had it not died, Reuven would be liable. The theft was due to his negligence.</p>
<p class="bas indent1"><span class="nm">(i)</span><span class="cl">Question (Abaye):</span> R. Aba bar Mamal asked (why the renter in the Mishnah is exempt), and R. Ami said that the case is, he had permission to lend it. He did not merely say that the angel of death would have killed it no matter where it was!</p>
<p class="bas indent1"><span class="nm">(j)</span><span class="cl">Answer (Rava):</span> You understand that a Shomer who gave to a Shomer is liable because the owner does not want others handling his object. Therefore, R. Aba could ask;</p>
<p class="bas indent2"><span class="nm">1.</span>I obligate because the owner trusts only an oath of the first Shomer, but not of the second. R. Aba has no question (for in the Mishnah, the first Shomer saw it die, and can swear that it died normally)!</p>
<p class="bas indent1"><span class="nm">(k)</span><span class="cl">Question (against Abaye - Rami bar Chama - Mishnah):</span> If a Shomer brought the animal up a steep mountain and it fell, this is not Ones, he is liable.</p>
<p class="bas indent2"><span class="nm">1.</span><span class="cl">Inference:</span> Had it died by itself, he would be exempt. We do not say that the cold air of the mountain or the exertion killed it!</p>
<p class="bas indent1"><span class="nm">(l)</span><span class="cl">Answer:</span> The case is, the Shomer took it to a good pasture (this is normal care of an animal).</p>
<p class="bas indent1"><span class="nm">(m)</span><span class="cl">Question:</span> If so, he should be exempt even if it fell!</p>
<p class="bas indent1"><span class="nm">(n)</span><span class="cl">Answer:</span> He should have grabbed it.</p>
<p class="bas indent1"><span class="nm">(o)</span><span class="cl">Question:</span> The previous clause taught that if the animal went up by itself and it fell, this is Ones, and he is exempt!</p>
<p class="bas indent1"><span class="nm">(p)</span><span class="cl">Answer:</span> The case is, he tried to grab it, and it evaded him and went up. He tried to grab it, and it evaded him and went down.</p>
