<p class="bas subject"><span class="nm">1)</span>THINGS THAT WARM THE <i>EVER</i></p>
<p class="bas indent1"><span class="nm">(a)</span><span class="cl">(Abaye):</span> Kohanim who ride on camels may not eat Terumah. (This heats the Ever. We are concerned lest they had emissions.)</p>
<p class="bas indent1"><span class="nm">(b)</span><span class="cl">Support (Beraisa):</span> All men who ride on camels are Resha'im. All shipdrivers are Tzadikim. (Dangers at sea make them turn to Hash-m.) Donkey-drivers are mixed:</p>
<p class="bas indent2"><span class="nm">1.</span><span class="cl">Version #1:</span> Those who ride with saddles are Tzadikim. (The Ever is not warmed.) Those who ride without saddles are Resha'im.</p>
<p class="bas indent2"><span class="nm">2.</span><span class="cl">Version #2:</span> Those who ride with their legs apart are Resha'im (the Ever is warmed.) Those who ride with both legs to one side are Tzadikim.</p>
<p class="bas indent1"><span class="nm">(c)</span>R. Yehoshua ben Levi cursed one who sleeps Perakdan (Rashi - on his back, lest he have an erection and it will be noticeable. Alternatively, perhaps his hands (Rashbam - garment) will warm the Ever. Aruch - Perakdan is face down. This warms the Ever.)</p>
<p class="bas indent1"><span class="nm">(d)</span><span class="cl">Question:</span> Rav Yosef taught, one should not recite (before sleeping) "Shma Yisrael... " in a position of Perakdan.</p>
<p class="bas indent2"><span class="nm">1.</span><span class="cl">Inference:</span> One should not recite Shma while Perakdan, but he may sleep Perakdan!</p>
<p class="bas indent1"><span class="nm">(e)</span><span class="cl">Answer:</span> Rav Yosef forbids reciting Shma even when leaning slightly to the side, but one may sleep that way.</p>
<p class="bas indent1"><span class="nm">(f)</span><span class="cl">Question:</span> R. Yochanan would recite Shma this way!</p>
<p class="bas indent1"><span class="nm">(g)</span><span class="cl">Answer:</span> He was stout. (It was hard for him to turn totally onto his side, therefore he was permitted to lean slightly.)</p>
<p class="bas subject"><span class="nm">2)</span>IF BLOOD IS FOUND AFTER BI'AH</p>
<p class="bas indent1"><span class="nm">(a)</span><span class="cl">(Mishnah):</span> Benos Yisrael prepare two cloths for Bedikos after Bi'ah, one for her, and one for him. (Perhaps she saw blood and it came on his Ever);</p>
<p class="bas indent2"><span class="nm">1.</span>Tzenu'os prepare a third cloth to check themselves beforehand.</p>
<p class="bas indent1"><span class="nm">(b)</span>If blood is found on his cloth, they are both Teme'im. (Surely he was Bo'el Nidah.) Each must bring a Korban;</p>
<p class="bas indent1"><span class="nm">(c)</span>If she checked herself Osyom (immediately after Bi'ah) and found blood, they are both Teme'im and bring Korbanos;</p>
<p class="bas indent1"><span class="nm">(d)</span>If she did a Bedikah <i>later</i> and found blood, they do not bring a Korban. Their Tum'ah is Safek. (He is Safek Bo'el Nidah. She is surely Nidah now, but perhaps she was not during Bi'ah);</p>
<p class="bas indent2"><span class="nm">1.</span><i>Later</i> means after the time to get off the bed and clean the area (of her Ervah).</p>
<p class="bas indent1"><span class="nm">(e)</span>If blood is found on her cloth after this, the 24 hours apply to her, and he is not (even Safek) Bo'el Nidah;</p>
<p class="bas indent1"><span class="nm">(f)</span>R. Akiva says, he is (Safek) Bo'el Nidah.</p>
<p class="bas indent1"><span class="nm">(g)</span>Chachamim admit that if she finds a Kesem, he is a Bo'el Nidah.</p>
<p class="bas indent1"><span class="nm">(h)</span><span class="cl">(Gemara) Question:</span> (If blood is found on her cloth Osyom), why are they definitely Tamei? Perhaps the blood came from a louse!</p>
<p class="bas indent1"><span class="nm">(i)</span><span class="cl">Version #1 - Answer (R. Zeira):</span> The place (of Ervah) is (surely free of lice. It is as if it was) checked.</p>
<p class="bas indent1"><span class="nm">(j)</span><span class="cl">Version #2 - Answer (R. Zeira):</span> The place is Dachuk (tight. It is hard for lice to enter. Therefore, we are not concerned.)</p>
<p class="bas indent1"><span class="nm">(k)</span><span class="cl">Question:</span> What is the difference between these answers?</p>
<p class="bas indent1"><span class="nm">(l)</span><span class="cl">Answer:</span> If a squashed louse was found on the cloth (away from the blood):</p>
<p class="bas indent2"><span class="nm">1.</span>If the place is considered checked, we assume that the louse came from elsewhere (after Bi'ah. The blood must be from her);</p>
<p class="bas indent2"><span class="nm">2.</span>If it is Dachuk, we assume that the Ever pushed the louse in (and it was mashed during Bi'ah. The blood is from it.)</p>
<p class="bas subject"><span class="nm">3)</span>IF THE CLOTH WAS NOT CHECKED IMMEDIATELY</p>
<p class="bas indent1"><span class="nm">(a)</span><span class="cl">(Rav):</span> If a woman checked herself with a checked cloth (she knows that it was clean) and slapped it on her thigh, and the next day found blood on her thigh (our text, Rashi; R. Chananel - on the cloth), she is a Nidah.</p>
<p class="bas indent2"><span class="nm">1.</span><span class="cl">Rav Simi bar Chiya:</span> You told us that she only suspects lest she is a Nidah! (Perhaps other blood was on her thigh.)</p>
<p class="bas indent1"><span class="nm">(b)</span><span class="cl">(Shmuel and Rabanan of the Beis Medrash):</span> She is a Nidah.</p>
<p class="bas indent1"><span class="nm">(c)</span><span class="cl">(Rav Yosef):</span> If a woman checked herself with an unchecked cloth and put it in a box, and the next day found blood on it, R. Chiya used to say that she is Teme'ah. At the end of his days he said that she is Tehorah.</p>
<p class="bas indent1"><span class="nm">(d)</span><span class="cl">Question:</span> Did he used to say that she is (definitely) Nidah, and at the end of his days he said that she is Teme'ah (like one who found a) Kesem (i.e. Safek Nidah)?</p>
<p class="bas indent2"><span class="nm">1.</span>Or, did he used to say that she is Teme'ah Kesem, and at the end of his days he said that she is (definitely) Tehorah?</p>
<p class="bas indent1"><span class="nm">(e)</span><span class="cl">Answer (Beraisa - Rebbi):</span> If a woman checked herself with an unchecked cloth and put it in a box, and the next day found blood on it, she is Nidah;</p>
<p class="bas indent2"><span class="nm">1.</span>R. Chiya says, she is Teme'ah Kesem.</p>
<p class="bas bbbline">14b----------------------------------------14b</p>
<p class="bas indent2"><span class="nm">2.</span><span class="cl">R. Chiya:</span> Don't you agree that she is Teme'ah only if the blood covers the area of a bean (like the law of a Kesem)?</p>
<p class="bas indent2"><span class="nm">3.</span><span class="cl">Rebbi:</span> I agree.</p>
<p class="bas indent2"><span class="nm">4.</span><span class="cl">R. Chiya:</span> If so, you should agree that she is Teme'ah Kesem!</p>
<p class="bas indent2"><span class="nm">5.</span>Rebbi holds that since more than the area of a bean was found, surely it came from her.</p>
<p class="bas indent2"><span class="nm">6.</span><span class="cl">Summation of answer:</span> This dialogue was at the end of R. Chiya's life (when he was Rebbi's colleague. Earlier, he would have addressed Rebbi with a title of respect, in place of 'you'.)</p>
<p class="bas indent1"><span class="nm">(f)</span>Rebbi told R. Yishmael b'Rebbi Yosi that Rav Chama bar Bisa is a great Chacham.</p>
<p class="bas indent2"><span class="nm">1.</span><span class="cl">R. Yishmael b'Rebbi Yosi (to Rav Chama):</span> Ask me something!</p>
<p class="bas indent2"><span class="nm">2.</span><span class="cl">Question (Rav Chama):</span> If a woman checked herself with an unchecked cloth and put it in a box, and the next day found blood on it, what is the law?</p>
<p class="bas indent2"><span class="nm">3.</span><span class="cl">R. Yishmael:</span> Should I tell you my father's opinion, or Rebbi's?</p>
<p class="bas indent2"><span class="nm">4.</span><span class="cl">Rav Chama:</span> Tell me Rebbi's.</p>
<p class="bas indent2"><span class="nm">5.</span><span class="cl">R. Yishmael:</span> A great Chacham would prefer to hear the opinion of the teacher (R. Yosi), and not of the Talmid (Rebbi)!</p>
<p class="bas indent2"><span class="nm">6.</span>Rav Chama held that because Rebbi headed the academy, he was always around Chachamim, so he became a bigger Chacham than R. Yosi.</p>
<p class="bas indent1"><span class="nm">(g)</span><span class="cl">Question:</span> What was the argument of R. Yosi and Rebbi?</p>
<p class="bas indent1"><span class="nm">(h)</span><span class="cl">Answer (Rav Ada bar Masnah):</span> Rebbi is Metamei, and R. Yosi is Metaher.</p>
<p class="bas indent1"><span class="nm">(i)</span><span class="cl">(R. Zeira):</span> Rebbi is Metamei like R. Meir, and R. Yosi is Metaher according to his own opinion;</p>
<p class="bas indent2"><span class="nm">1.</span><span class="cl">(Beraisa - R. Meir):</span> If a woman urinated and saw blood:</p>
<p class="bas indent3"><span class="nm">i.</span>If she was standing, she is Teme'ah. (The urine passes by the Makor.) If she was sitting, she is Tehorah;</p>
<p class="bas indent2"><span class="nm">2.</span>R. Yosi says, in either case she is Tehorah.</p>
<p class="bas indent1"><span class="nm">(j)</span><span class="cl">Question (Rav Acha brei d'Rava):</span> R. Yosi b'Rebbi Chanina said that R. Meir considers her Teme'ah Kesem, and Rebbi considers her a (proper) Nidah!</p>
<p class="bas indent1"><span class="nm">(k)</span><span class="cl">Answer (Rav Ashi):</span> We hold that R. Yosi b'Rebbi Chanina says that R. Meir considers her a Nidah.</p>
<p class="bas subject"><span class="nm">4)</span>IF SHE FOUND BLOOD LATER</p>
<p class="bas indent1"><span class="nm">(a)</span><span class="cl">(Mishnah):</span> If blood is found on her cloth Osyom, they are both Teme'im...</p>
<p class="bas indent1"><span class="nm">(b)</span><span class="cl">(Beraisa):</span> Shi'ur Veses (Osyom) is the time needed for the Ever to leave the entrance, and for the cloth to enter immediately.</p>
<p class="bas indent2"><span class="nm">1.</span>Within Shi'ur Veses, it is possible to do Kinu'ach, but not a Bedikah.</p>
<p class="bas indent1"><span class="nm">(c)</span><span class="cl">(Mishnah):</span> If blood is found on her cloth later... (they are exempt from a Korban).</p>
<p class="bas indent1"><span class="nm">(d)</span><span class="cl">Contradiction (Beraisa):</span> They must bring an Asham Taluy.</p>
<p class="bas indent1"><span class="nm">(e)</span><span class="cl">Resolution:</span> The Tana of our Mishnah exempts, for he holds that Asham Taluy applies only when there were two objects (involved in the Safek. One is permitted, and the other is forbidden with Kares, and one ate (or had Bi'ah with... ) one of them.)</p>
<p class="bas indent1"><span class="nm">(f)</span><span class="cl">(Mishnah):</span> "Later" (is after the time to get off the bed and clean the area).</p>
<p class="bas indent1"><span class="nm">(g)</span><span class="cl">Contradiction (Beraisa - R. Eliezer bar Tzadok):</span> "Later" is the time to stretch her hand and take a cloth from under the pillow or blanket, and do a Bedikah.</p>
<p class="bas indent1"><span class="nm">(h)</span><span class="cl">Answer #1 (Rav Chisda):</span> (The Mishnah said that if blood is found on her cloth after Osyom, they are Safek Teme'im.) It then teaches that the Safek Tum'ah of "later" is limited. If she delayed the time to get off the bed... , he is Tahor.</p>
<p class="bas indent1"><span class="nm">(i)</span><span class="cl">Question (a Beraisa explaining our Mishnah):</span> If blood is found on her cloth later, they do not bring a Korban, and their Tum'ah is Safek;</p>
<p class="bas indent2"><span class="nm">1.</span>"Later" means after the time to get off the bed and clean the area.</p>
<p class="bas indent1"><span class="nm">(j)</span><span class="cl">Answer:</span> It means that "later" is the time to stretch her hand and take a cloth from under the pillow or blanket and do a Bedikah;</p>
<p class="bas indent2"><span class="nm">1.</span>If she delayed the time to get off the bed and clean the area, R. Akiva and Chachamim argue (about his Tum'ah).</p>
<p class="bas indent1"><span class="nm">(k)</span><span class="cl">Question:</span> The Mishnah says "after this"! (They argue about after the time to get off the bed and clean the area.)</p>
<p class="bas indent1"><span class="nm">(l)</span><span class="cl">Answer:</span> It means that this is the later time that R. Akiva and Chachamim argue about (the time to get off the bed... )</p>
<p class="bas indent1"><span class="nm">(m)</span><span class="cl">Answer #2 (Rav Ashi):</span> Both of these refer to the same amount of time:</p>
<p class="bas indent2"><span class="nm">1.</span>If the cloth is already in her hand, it is the time to get off the bed and clean the area;</p>
<p class="bas indent2"><span class="nm">2.</span>If she is not holding a cloth, it is the time to stretch her hand and take a cloth from under the pillow or blanket and do a Bedikah.</p>
