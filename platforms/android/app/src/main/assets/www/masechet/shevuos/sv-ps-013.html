<p class="bas subject"><span class="nm">1)</span>ATONEMENT WITHOUT TESHUVAH</p>
<p class="bas indent1"><span class="nm">(a)</span><span class="cl">Answer (R. Zeira):</span> The case is, he did not repent. The Mishnah is Rebbi;</p>
<p class="bas indent2"><span class="nm">1.</span><span class="cl">(Rebbi):</span> Yom Kipur atones for all sins, whether or not a person repented, with three exceptions: one who denies the basis of Torah, one who ridicules Torah, and one who annuls circumcision (he does not circumcise himself, or he stretches his skin in order to appear uncircumcised);</p>
<p class="bas indent2"><span class="nm">2.</span>For these three, Yom Kipur atones only if he repented.</p>
<p class="bas indent1"><span class="nm">(b)</span><span class="cl">Question:</span> What is Rebbi's reason?</p>
<p class="bas indent1"><span class="nm">(c)</span><span class="cl">(Beraisa):</span> "Ki Davar Hash-m Bazah" is one who denies the basis of Torah or ridicules Torah;</p>
<p class="bas indent2"><span class="nm">1.</span>"V'Es Mitzvaso Hefar" is one who annuls circumcision;</p>
<p class="bas indent2"><span class="nm">2.</span>"Hikares Tikares" - he is cut off before Yom Kipur and after Yom Kipur.</p>
<p class="bas indent2"><span class="nm">3.</span><span class="cl">Suggestion:</span> Perhaps this is even if he repented!</p>
<p class="bas indent2"><span class="nm">4.</span><span class="cl">Rejection:</span> "Avonah Bah" - we discuss one who still has (not repented from) his sin.</p>
<p class="bas indent1"><span class="nm">(d)</span>Chachamim expound "Hikares" - he is cut off in this world; "Tikares" - he is cut off in the world to come;</p>
<p class="bas indent2"><span class="nm">1.</span>"Avonah Bah" - (this is only when he did not repent, but) if he repented and died, death cleanses.</p>
<p class="bas indent1"><span class="nm">(e)</span><span class="cl">Question:</span> Since the Seifa is R. Yehudah, also the Reisha must be R. Yehudah!</p>
<p class="bas indent2"><span class="nm">1.</span><span class="cl">(Seifa):</span> It atones for Yisraelim, Kohanim and an anointed Kohen alike.</p>
<p class="bas indent2"><span class="nm">2.</span>This is R. Yehudah's opinion!</p>
<p class="bas indent1"><span class="nm">(f)</span><span class="cl">Answer (Rav Yosef):</span> The Mishnah is Rebbi. He holds like R. Yehudah.</p>
<p class="bas indent1"><span class="nm">(g)</span><span class="cl">Question (Abaye):</span> Were you exact in saying that Rebbi holds like R. Yehudah, but we could not say the other way, for R. Yehudah does not hold like Rebbi?</p>
<p class="bas indent2"><span class="nm">1.</span>Or, could we also say that the Mishnah is R. Yehudah, and he holds like Rebbi?  You merely taught like one normally says, that the Talmid (Rebbi) holds like his teacher (R. Yehudah)?</p>
<p class="bas indent1"><span class="nm">(h)</span><span class="cl">Answer (Rav Yosef):</span> R. Yehudah does not hold like Rebbi.</p>
<p class="bas indent2"><span class="nm">1.</span><span class="cl">(Beraisa) Suggestion:</span> Perhaps Yom Kipur atones for people even if they do not repent;</p>
<p class="bas indent3"><span class="nm">i.</span>Chatas and Asham atone only for one who repented. Also Yom Kipur should atone only for one who repented!</p>
<p class="bas indent3"><span class="nm">ii.</span><span class="cl">Rejection:</span> Chatas and Asham do not atone for one who sinned b'Mezid. Yom Kipur atones even for intentional sins, we should say that it even atones for one who did not repent!</p>
<p class="bas indent3"><span class="nm">iii.</span>"Ach" is a distinction (there are people for whom Yom Kipur does not atone, i.e. one who did not repent).</p>
<p class="bas indent2"><span class="nm">2.</span>A Stam Sifra (Beraisa that expounds a verse of Vayikra) is R. Yehudah, and it says that Yom Kipur atones only for one who repents!</p>
<p class="bas indent1"><span class="nm">(i)</span><span class="cl">Contradiction (another Stam Sifra) Suggestion:</span> Perhaps Yom Kipur applies only to one who fasted, blessed the day, and did not do Melachah! (Rashi; R. Tam  - he refrains from Melachah <i>due to</i> Kedushas ha'Yom.)</p>
<p class="bas indent2"><span class="nm">1.</span><span class="cl">Rejection:</span> "Yom Kipurim Hu" teaches that it atones even for one who did none of the above. (Presumably, such person did not repent.)</p>
<p class="bas indent1"><span class="nm">(j)</span><span class="cl">Answer #1 (Abaye):</span> The first Sifra is like R. Yehudah, and the latter Sifra is like Rebbi.</p>
<p class="bas indent1"><span class="nm">(k)</span><span class="cl">Answer #2 (Rava):</span> Both are like Rebbi. The first Sifra discusses transgressions of (Kares of) Yom Kipur itself. Rebbi admits that Yom Kipur does not atone for them without Teshuvah.</p>
<p class="bas indent2"><span class="nm">1.</span>We must say so. If not, according to Rebbi, the Kares written for eating or working on Yom Kipur would never apply!</p>
<p class="bas indent2"><span class="nm">2.</span><span class="cl">Objection:</span> It would apply to one who transgressed at night and died that night, for only the <i>day</i> of Yom Kipur atones!</p>
<p class="bas indent2"><span class="nm">3.</span><span class="cl">Correction:</span> Rather, we must say this way, for if not, the Kares for eating or working on the <i>day</i> of Yom Kipur would never apply!</p>
<p class="bas bbbline">13b----------------------------------------13b</p>
<p class="bas indent2"><span class="nm">4.</span><span class="cl">Rejection:</span> It would apply to one who died while transgressing (Tosfos - or he died at any time during Yom Kipur), or one who transgressed as the day ended, for there was no time for Yom Kipur to atone for him.</p>
<p class="bas subject"><span class="nm">2)</span>WHAT ATONES FOR THE KOHANIM?</p>
<p class="bas indent1"><span class="nm">(a)</span><span class="cl">(Mishnah):</span> It atones for Yisraelim, Kohanim and an anointed Kohen alike.</p>
<p class="bas indent1"><span class="nm">(b)</span><span class="cl">Question:</span> The Mishnah proceeds to explain the difference between them!</p>
<p class="bas indent1"><span class="nm">(c)</span><span class="cl">Answer (Rav Yehudah):</span> The Mishnah says, they all get atonement for <i>other</i> transgressions through the goat that is sent (to Azazel);</p>
<p class="bas indent2"><span class="nm">1.</span>It then explains that the bull atones for Tum'ah of Kohanim, and the inner goat atones for Tum'ah of Yisraelim.</p>
<p class="bas indent1"><span class="nm">(d)</span>Our Mishnah is R. Yehudah;</p>
<p class="bas indent2"><span class="nm">1.</span><span class="cl">Version #1 - Rashi (Beraisa - R. Yehudah):</span> "V'Chiper Es Mikdash ha'Kodesh" - (the Kohen Gadol sprinkles the blood of the bull and inner goat to atone for Teme'im who entered) the Kodesh ha'Kodoshim. "Ohel Mo'ed" teaches that it atones for (Teme'im who entered) the Heichal; "ha'Mizbe'ach" teaches about (Teme'im who offered on) the Altar; "Yechaper" teaches about (entering) the Chatzer of the Mikdash;</p>
<p class="bas indent2"><span class="nm">2.</span><span class="cl">Version #2 - Tosfos (Beraisa - R. Yehudah):</span> "V'Chiper Es Mikdash ha'Kodesh" teaches about  (sprinkling the bloods between the staves of the Aron, in) the Kodesh ha'Kodoshim. (He also sprinkles towards the Paroches, while in the) "Ohel Mo'ed", (and on the inner) "Mizbe'ach". "Yechaper" teaches about (pouring the leftover blood on the base of the outer Altar, which is in) the Chatzer; (end of Version #2)</p>
<p class="bas indent3"><span class="nm">i.</span>"Kohanim", "Am ha'Kahal" (Yisraelim) and "Yechaper" (to include Leviyim), to teach that the goat that is sent atones equally for all of them.</p>
<p class="bas indent2"><span class="nm">3.</span>R. Shimon says, just like the blood of the inner goat atones for Yisraelim for Tum'ah of the Mikdash or Kodshim, the blood of the bull atones for Kohanim for Tum'ah of the Mikdash or Kodshim;</p>
<p class="bas indent3"><span class="nm">i.</span>Just like the confession over the inner goat atones for Yisraelim for other transgressions, the confession over the bull atones for Kohanim for other transgressions.</p>
<p class="bas indent2"><span class="nm">4.</span><span class="cl">Question:</span> Surely, the verse equates the atonement of Kohanim and Yisraelim. How does R. Shimon explain this?</p>
<p class="bas indent2"><span class="nm">5.</span><span class="cl">Answer:</span> It teaches that they all get atonement for Tum'ah and for other transgressions. However, they get atonement through different Korbanos.</p>
<p class="bas indent1"><span class="nm">(e)</span><span class="cl">Question:</span> What is R. Shimon's reason?</p>
<p class="bas indent1"><span class="nm">(f)</span><span class="cl">Answer:</span> "V'Lakach Es Shnei ha'Se'irim" equates the inner goat and the goat that is sent;</p>
<p class="bas indent2"><span class="nm">1.</span>Just like the inner goat does not atone for Kohanim for Tum'ah (since it says "la'Am"), the goat that is sent does not atone for Kohanim for other transgressions.</p>
<p class="bas indent1"><span class="nm">(g)</span>R. Yehudah holds that the Torah equates the goats to teach that they should have the same appearance, height and price.</p>
<p class="bas indent1"><span class="nm">(h)</span><span class="cl">Question:</span> Who is the Tana of the coming Beraisa (which suggests that if Kohanim do not get atonement through the bull, they get no atonement)?</p>
<p class="bas indent2"><span class="nm">1.</span><span class="cl">(Beraisa):</span> "V'Shachat Es Se'ir ha'Chatas Asher la'Am" - it does not atone for Kohanim;</p>
<p class="bas indent3"><span class="nm">i.</span>Rather, they get atonement through the Kohen Gadol's bull.</p>
<p class="bas indent2"><span class="nm">2.</span><span class="cl">Question:</span> Regarding the bull it says "Asher Lo." This should teach that it does not atone for them!</p>
<p class="bas indent3"><span class="nm">i.</span>If so, and nothing would atone for them!</p>
<p class="bas indent2"><span class="nm">3.</span><span class="cl">Answer #1:</span> "Yechaper v'Al ha'Kohanim" proves that they get atonement;</p>
<p class="bas indent3"><span class="nm">i.</span>It is more reasonable to say that they get atonement through the Kohen Gadol's bull, for it atones for more than it says ("Lo", just himself). It also atones for "Beiso" (the Kohen Gadol's wife);</p>
<p class="bas indent3"><span class="nm">ii.</span>We do not find that the goat that is sent atones for more than Yisraelim. It does not atone for the Kohen Gadol's wife.</p>
<p class="bas indent2"><span class="nm">4.</span><span class="cl">Answer #2:</span> Alternatively, we can learn from "Beis Aharon Borechu Es Hash-m" - all the Kohanim are called "Beiso."</p>
<p class="bas indent1"><span class="nm">(i)</span><span class="cl">Answer #1 (R. Yirmeyah):</span> The Tana is not R. Yehudah, for he says that Kohanim get atonement through the goat that is sent.</p>
<p class="bas indent2"><span class="nm">1.</span><span class="cl">Question:</span> If so, who is the Tana?</p>
<p class="bas indent2"><span class="nm">2.</span><span class="cl">Answer (Rava):</span> It is R. Shimon, who says that Kohanim do not get atonement through the goat that is sent.</p>
