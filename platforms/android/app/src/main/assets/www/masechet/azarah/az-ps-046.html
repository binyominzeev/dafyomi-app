<p class="bas indent1"><span class="nm">(a)</span><span class="cl">Suggestion:</span> Perhaps we must create glorious nice nicknames for idolatry.</p>
<p class="bas indent1"><span class="nm">(b)</span><span class="cl">Objection:</span> This cannot be!</p>
<p class="bas indent1"><span class="nm">(c)</span><span class="cl">Suggestion:</span> Rather, perhaps we may create nicknames that are neither glorious nor derogatory.</p>
<p class="bas indent1"><span class="nm">(d)</span><span class="cl">Rejection:</span> "Shaketz Teshaketzenu v'Sa'ev Tesa'avenu."</p>
<p class="bas indent2"><span class="nm">1.</span>If they call it 'Beis Galya (the high place)', we call it 'Beis Karya (the pit)'. If they call it 'Ein Kol (the eye of all)', we call it 'Ein Kotz (the eye of the thorn).'</p>
<p class="bas subject"><span class="nm">2)</span>NATURAL OBJECTS THAT WERE WORSHIPPED</p>
<p class="bas indent1"><span class="nm">(a)</span><span class="cl">(A reciter of Beraisos):</span> If Nochrim worship mountains and hills, they are permitted. The Nochrim are liable to die;</p>
<p class="bas indent2"><span class="nm">1.</span>If they worship vegetation, it is forbidden, and the Nochrim are liable to die.</p>
<p class="bas indent1"><span class="nm">(b)</span><span class="cl">(Rav Sheshes):</span> Your Beraisa is like R. Yosi b'Rebbi Yehudah, who says that if a tree was planted, and later it was Ne'evad, it is forbidden.</p>
<p class="bas indent1"><span class="nm">(c)</span><span class="cl">Question:</span> Why not say that it was initially planted to be Ne'evad, and the Beraisa is even like Chachamim?</p>
<p class="bas indent1"><span class="nm">(d)</span><span class="cl">Answer:</span> Presumably, the case is similar to mountains (the Reisha). Just like mountains were not initially made to be Ne'evadim, also the vegetation.</p>
<p class="bas indent1"><span class="nm">(e)</span><span class="cl">(Bnei R. Chiya or R. Yochanan):</span> If rocks of a mountain came loose (and they were Ne'evadim), they are permitted;</p>
<p class="bas indent1"><span class="nm">(f)</span><span class="cl">(The other of Bnei R. Chiya and R. Yochanan):</span> They are forbidden.</p>
<p class="bas indent1"><span class="nm">(g)</span>The lenient opinion considers them like a mountain. Just like man had no part in making a mountain, and a mountain is permitted, also the rocks.</p>
<p class="bas indent2"><span class="nm">1.</span><span class="cl">Question:</span> We cannot learn from a mountain. It is attached!</p>
<p class="bas indent2"><span class="nm">2.</span><span class="cl">Answer:</span> An animal is not attached, and also it is permitted.</p>
<p class="bas indent2"><span class="nm">3.</span><span class="cl">Question:</span> We cannot learn from an animal. It is alive!</p>
<p class="bas indent2"><span class="nm">4.</span><span class="cl">Answer:</span> A mountain is not alive, and it is permitted.</p>
<p class="bas indent2"><span class="nm">5.</span><span class="cl">Conclusion:</span> Each has its own stringency. The Tzad ha'Shavah (common side) of them is that man had no part in making them, and they are permitted. Also anything that man had no part in making it is permitted.</p>
<p class="bas indent2"><span class="nm">6.</span><span class="cl">Objection:</span> We cannot learn from a mountain and an animal. Both are like they were created, but the rocks changed (became detached)!</p>
<p class="bas indent2"><span class="nm">7.</span><span class="cl">Answer #1:</span> We learn from the Tzad ha'Shavah of a blemished animal (it changed) and a mountain.</p>
<p class="bas indent2"><span class="nm">8.</span><span class="cl">Answer #2:</span> We learn from the Tzad ha'Shavah of an animal and a tree that dried up. (If it was not planted to be Ne'evad (according to Chachamim), or it was not planted by man (according to R. Yosi b'Rebbi Yehudah), it is permitted.)</p>
<p class="bas indent1"><span class="nm">(h)</span>The stringent opinion learns from "Shaketz Teshaketzenu." We never expound to permit idolatry (unless the verse explicitly permits).</p>
<p class="bas indent1"><span class="nm">(i)</span><span class="cl">Suggestion:</span> We learn from the following that Bnei R. Chiya permit the rocks.</p>
<p class="bas indent2"><span class="nm">1.</span><span class="cl">Question (Chizkiyah (one of R. Chiya's sons)):</span> If a Yisrael erected an egg in order to bow to it, what is the law?</p>
<p class="bas indent3"><span class="nm">i.</span><span class="cl">(Assumption:</span> The case is, he erected it and bowed to it. Chizkiyah was unsure whether erecting it is an action, and we consider that man had a part in it.)</p>
<p class="bas indent3"><span class="nm">ii.</span><span class="cl">Inference:</span> Had he not erected it, it would be permitted!</p>
<p class="bas indent1"><span class="nm">(j)</span><span class="cl">Rejection:</span> Really, Bnei R. Chiya forbid the rocks. If a Yisrael bowed to an egg, even if he did not erect it, it is forbidden;</p>
<p class="bas indent2"><span class="nm">1.</span>The case is, he erected it and never bowed to it.</p>
<p class="bas indent1"><span class="nm">(k)</span><span class="cl">Question:</span> According to whom was the question?</p>
<p class="bas indent2"><span class="nm">1.</span>If it is like the opinion (R. Yishmael) that idolatry of a Yisrael is forbidden immediately (once it is designated, even before it is Ne'evad), surely it is forbidden!</p>
<p class="bas indent2"><span class="nm">2.</span>If it is according to R. Akiva, idolatry of a Yisrael is not forbidden until it is Ne'evad!</p>
<p class="bas indent1"><span class="nm">(l)</span><span class="cl">Answer:</span> He asked according to R. Akiva. The Yisrael erected it and never bowed to it, but a Nochri bowed to it;</p>
<p class="bas indent2"><span class="nm">1.</span><span class="cl">(Rav Yehudah):</span> If a Yisrael erected a brick and never bowed to it, but a Nochri bowed to it, it is forbidden.</p>
<p class="bas indent1"><span class="nm">(m)</span>Chizkiyah asked that perhaps this is only regarding a brick, for it is recognizable that it was erected (it is taller when it is erected), but not regarding an egg;</p>
<p class="bas indent2"><span class="nm">1.</span>Or, perhaps the erection is considered an action even regarding an egg!</p>
<p class="bas indent1"><span class="nm">(n)</span>His question is not resolved.</p>
<p class="bas subject"><span class="nm">3)</span>USING IN THE 'MIKDASH' AN ITEM WORSHIPPED WHEN ATTACHED</p>
<p class="bas indent1"><span class="nm">(a)</span><span class="cl">Question (Rami bar Chama):</span> If one bowed to a mountain, may its stones be used for the Altar?</p>
<p class="bas bbbline">46b----------------------------------------46b</p>
<p class="bas indent2"><span class="nm">1.</span>If something attached is Ne'evad, may it be offered in the Mikdash?</p>
<p class="bas indent2"><span class="nm">2.</span>If you will say that it may not be offered (for a Korban) in the Mikdash, is something needed for Korbanos (e.g. the Altar) like a Korban (in this respect)?</p>
<p class="bas indent1"><span class="nm">(b)</span><span class="cl">Answer (Rava):</span> A Kal va'Chomer teaches this. A detached Esnan (wages of a harlot) is permitted to people (to benefit from it), and an attached Esnan may not be used in the Mikdash;</p>
<p class="bas indent2"><span class="nm">1.</span>"Lo Savi Esnan... Beis Hash-m" - the verse does not distinguish whether it is attached;</p>
<p class="bas indent2"><span class="nm">2.</span>Something detached that was Ne'evad is forbidden to people. All the more so something attached that was Ne'evad may not be used in the Mikdash!</p>
<p class="bas indent1"><span class="nm">(c)</span><span class="cl">Objection (Rav Huna brei d'Rav Yehoshua):</span> One can learn oppositely!</p>
<p class="bas indent2"><span class="nm">1.</span>Something detached that was Ne'evad is forbidden to people, but something attached that was Ne'evad may be used in the Mikdash;</p>
<p class="bas indent3"><span class="nm">i.</span>"Eloheihem Al he'Harim" - the mountains are not considered idols. The verse does not distinguish. It permits them to people and for use in the Mikdash;</p>
<p class="bas indent2"><span class="nm">2.</span>A detached Esnan is permitted to people. All the more so an attached Esnan may be used in the Mikdash!</p>
<p class="bas indent3"><span class="nm">i.</span>"Beis Hash-m" teaches as follows.</p>
<p class="bas indent3"><span class="nm">ii.</span><span class="cl">(Beraisa - R. Eliezer):</span> "Beis Hash-m" excludes the red heifer (it is not brought in the Mikdash, so an Esnan may be used for it);</p>
<p class="bas indent3"><span class="nm">iii.</span>Chachamim say, this comes to include gold plating for the Heichal. (An Esnan may not be used for it.)</p>
<p class="bas indent1"><span class="nm">(d)</span><span class="cl">Answer (Rava):</span> Since one Kal va'Chomer teaches a stringency and another teaches a leniency, we learn the stringency.</p>
<p class="bas indent1"><span class="nm">(e)</span><span class="cl">Question (Rav Papa):</span> Is it really true that we always learn the stringency?!</p>
<p class="bas indent2"><span class="nm">1.</span>Regarding sprinkling (with water with ashes of the red heifer on Shabbos on (Rashi; Rambam - the day before) Erev Pesach to enable one to bring the Korban Pesach), R. Eliezer learns the stringency, (and permits sprinkling) and obligates the person to bring the Pesach. R. Akiva learns the leniency, (and forbids sprinkling) and exempts the person from bringing the Pesach! (The Halachah follows R. Akiva.)</p>
<p class="bas indent2"><span class="nm">2.</span><span class="cl">(Mishnah - R. Akiva):</span> Perhaps you should learn oppositely! Sprinkling (on Shabbos) is forbidden only mid'Rabanan, and it is not permitted for the sake of bringing the Pesach. All the more so we should not permit slaughtering on Shabbos, which is forbidden mid'Oraisa!</p>
<p class="bas indent1"><span class="nm">(f)</span><span class="cl">Answer:</span> R. Akiva did not really learn a Kal va'Chomer. He was just trying to subtly remind his Rebbi what he (R. Eliezer) himself had taught him, that sprinkling is not permitted for the sake of the Pesach.</p>
<p class="bas indent1"><span class="nm">(g)</span><span class="cl">Support (Beraisa - R. Akiva):</span> You yourself taught me that sprinkling on Shabbos is forbidden only mid'Rabanan, and it is not permitted for the sake of the Pesach.</p>
<p class="bas indent1"><span class="nm">(h)</span><span class="cl">Question (Rami bar Chama):</span> If someone bowed to attached wheat, may it be used for a Minchah offering?</p>
<p class="bas indent2"><span class="nm">1.</span>Does Shinuy (a change, i.e. cutting and processing the wheat to make flour) permit something Ne'evad?</p>
