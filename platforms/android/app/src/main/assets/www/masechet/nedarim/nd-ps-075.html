<p class="bas subject"><span class="nm">1)</span>DOES <i>MA'AMAR</i> MAKE <i>NISU'IN</i>?</p>
<p class="bas indent1"><span class="nm">(a)</span><span class="cl">Question:</span> How does this Beraisa support R. Ami?</p>
<p class="bas indent1"><span class="nm">(b)</span><span class="cl">Answer #1:</span> R. Akiva responded, '... whether or not he gave a Ma'amar.' This shows that R. Eliezer discusses a case in which he gave a Ma'amar!</p>
<p class="bas indent1"><span class="nm">(c)</span><span class="cl">Answer #2:</span> R. Eliezer said when she enters the Yavam's Reshus, the Kinyan is completed.</p>
<p class="bas indent2"><span class="nm">1.</span>If she was not already partially acquired through a Ma'amar, it is inappropriate to say that the Kinyan is completed. We must say that he gave to her a Ma'amar.</p>
<p class="bas indent1"><span class="nm">(d)</span><span class="cl">Question:</span> What does it mean 'vows are like other laws'?</p>
<p class="bas indent1"><span class="nm">(e)</span><span class="cl">Answer (Rava):</span> She is not considered Mekudeshes regarding stoning (if she has Bi'ah with a stranger, whether there was one Yavam or two, whether or not a Ma'amar was given. Also, regarding vows she is not considered Mekudeshes.)</p>
<p class="bas indent1"><span class="nm">(f)</span><span class="cl">Support (Rav Ashi - Mishnah):</span> A Yevamah is not totally acquired to her Yavam like an Arusah is to her husband.</p>
<p class="bas subject"><span class="nm">2)</span>ANNULMENT IN ADVANCE</p>
<p class="bas indent1"><span class="nm">(a)</span><span class="cl">(Mishnah):</span> If a man told his wife (Leah) 'all vows that you will make from now until I return from Ploni (a certain place) are affirmed', this has no effect;</p>
<p class="bas indent1"><span class="nm">(b)</span>R. Eliezer says, if he says 'they are annulled', they are annulled;</p>
<p class="bas indent1"><span class="nm">(c)</span>Chachamim say, they are not.</p>
<p class="bas indent2"><span class="nm">1.</span><span class="cl">R. Eliezer:</span> If he can annul vows that already took effect, all the more so, he can annul vows that did not yet take effect!</p>
<p class="bas indent2"><span class="nm">2.</span><span class="cl">Chachamim:</span> "Her husband will affirm it, her husband will annul it" - only a vow that can be affirmed (i.e. has already taken effect) can be annulled.</p>
<p class="bas indent1"><span class="nm">(d)</span><span class="cl">(Gemara) Question:</span> According to R. Eliezer, do the vows take effect and then they are annulled? Or, do they not take effect at all?</p>
<p class="bas bbbline">75b----------------------------------------75b</p>
<p class="bas indent2"><span class="nm">1.</span>This determines the law if Levi vowed 'this is forbidden like what Leah forbade.'</p>
<p class="bas indent3"><span class="nm">i.</span>Levi's vow also takes effect only if Leah's vow took effect.</p>
<p class="bas indent1"><span class="nm">(e)</span><span class="cl">Answer #1 (Mishnah - R. Eliezer):</span> If he can annul vows that already took effect, all the more so, he can annul vows that did not yet take effect!</p>
<p class="bas indent2"><span class="nm">1.</span>This shows that they do not take effect at all.</p>
<p class="bas indent1"><span class="nm">(f)</span><span class="cl">Rejection:</span> The Mishnah does not say 'they do not take effect', rather, they did not yet taken effect!</p>
<p class="bas indent1"><span class="nm">(g)</span><span class="cl">Answer #2 (Beraisa - R. Eliezer):</span> A man cannot annul his own vows after he vowed, but he can annul them before he vows;</p>
<p class="bas indent2"><span class="nm">1.</span>Regarding his wife's vows, which he can annul after she vowed, all the more so he can annul them before she vowed!</p>
<p class="bas indent2"><span class="nm">2.</span><span class="cl">Assumption:</span> His vows are like his wife's. Just like his do not take effect, also his wife's.</p>
<p class="bas indent1"><span class="nm">(h)</span><span class="cl">Rejection:</span> No, they are different. His don't take effect, but his wife's do.</p>
<p class="bas indent1"><span class="nm">(i)</span><span class="cl">Answer #3 (Beraisa - Chachamim):</span> We find that a Mikvah makes a Tamei (person or Kli) Tahor, but it does not save a Tahor person from becoming Tamei (afterwards);</p>
<p class="bas indent2"><span class="nm">1.</span>A person cannot be Metaher a Tamei, all the more so, he cannot save a Tahor person from becoming Tamei (i.e. that her vow will not take effect).</p>
<p class="bas indent2"><span class="nm">2.</span><span class="cl">Inference:</span> R. Eliezer holds that the vow does not take effect.</p>
