<p class="bas subject"><span class="nm">1)</span>CONCERN THAT SHE WILL NOT FULFILL THE <i>TANAI</i></p>
<p class="bas indent1"><span class="nm">(a)</span><span class="cl">(Beraisa):</span> If Reuven said 'this is your Get on condition that you will marry Ploni', she may not remarry. If she did, she may stay married.</p>
<p class="bas indent1"><span class="nm">(b)</span><span class="cl">Question:</span> How do we understand this?</p>
<p class="bas indent1"><span class="nm">(c)</span><span class="cl">Answer #1 (Rav Nachman):</span> She should not marry Ploni, lest people say that Reuven gave his wife to Ploni like a gift. If she married someone else, she remains married.</p>
<p class="bas indent1"><span class="nm">(d)</span><span class="cl">Objection:</span> Do we make a decree (to discourage such Gitin) that permits a married woman to live with another man?!</p>
<p class="bas indent1"><span class="nm">(e)</span><span class="cl">Answer #2 (Rav Nachman):</span> Rather, she should not marry Ploni, lest people say that Reuven gave his wife to Ploni like a gift. If she married Ploni, she remains married. We do not force her to leave due to our decree.</p>
<p class="bas indent1"><span class="nm">(f)</span><span class="cl">Objection (Rava):</span> Is she forbidden only to marry Ploni? She may not marry anyone until she fulfills the Tanai!</p>
<p class="bas indent2"><span class="nm">1.</span><span class="cl">Suggestion:</span> You (Rav Nachman) permit her to marry someone else now, get divorced later and then fulfill the Tanai, similar to your argument with Rav Yehudah.</p>
<p class="bas indent3"><span class="nm">i.</span><span class="cl">(Rav Yehudah):</span> If one vowed that he will not sleep today if he sleeps tomorrow, he may not sleep today, lest he sleep tomorrow;</p>
<p class="bas indent3"><span class="nm">ii.</span><span class="cl">(Rav Nachman):</span> He may sleep today. We are not concerned lest he sleep tomorrow.</p>
<p class="bas indent2"><span class="nm">2.</span><span class="cl">Rejection:</span> This comparison is faulty! There, one can stop himself from sleeping. He can prick himself with thorns. Here, a woman cannot divorce herself!</p>
<p class="bas indent1"><span class="nm">(g)</span><span class="cl">Answer #3 (Rava):</span> Rather, she may not marry Ploni, nor anyone else.</p>
<p class="bas indent2"><span class="nm">1.</span>She may not marry Ploni, lest people say that Reuven gave his wife to Ploni for a gift;</p>
<p class="bas indent2"><span class="nm">2.</span>She may not marry anyone else, lest she not fulfill the Tanai.</p>
<p class="bas indent3"><span class="nm">i.</span>If she married Ploni, she remains married. We do not force her to leave due to our decree;</p>
<p class="bas indent3"><span class="nm">ii.</span>If she married someone else, she must leave. We are concerned lest she not fulfill the Tanai.</p>
<p class="bas indent1"><span class="nm">(h)</span><span class="cl">Support (Beraisa):</span> She may not marry Ploni, nor anyone else;</p>
<p class="bas indent2"><span class="nm">1.</span>If she married Ploni, she remains married. If she married someone else, she must leave.</p>
<p class="bas subject"><span class="nm">2)</span><i>TANAYIM</i> THAT CANNOT BE FULFILLED</p>
<p class="bas indent1"><span class="nm">(a)</span><span class="cl">(Beraisa):</span> If one divorced his wife on condition that she will ascend to Heaven, or descend to the depths, or swallow a reed of four Amos, or bring to him a reed of 100 Amos, or cross the sea on foot, the Get is Pasul;</p>
<p class="bas indent1"><span class="nm">(b)</span>R. Yehudah ben Teima says, such a Get is valid;</p>
<p class="bas indent2"><span class="nm">1.</span>The rule is, if one made a Tanai that cannot be fulfilled, he merely taunts her with words. The Tanai is void, and the Get is valid.</p>
<p class="bas indent1"><span class="nm">(c)</span><span class="cl">(Rav Nachman):</span> The Halachah follows R. Yehudah (ben Teima).</p>
<p class="bas indent1"><span class="nm">(d)</span><span class="cl">(Rav Nachman bar Yitzchak):</span> A Mishnah is like R. Yehudah:</p>
<p class="bas indent2"><span class="nm">1.</span><span class="cl">(Mishnah):</span> If one makes a Tanai that can be fulfilled, the Tanai is valid.</p>
<p class="bas indent2"><span class="nm">2.</span><span class="cl">Inference:</span> If the Tanai cannot be fulfilled, it is invalid.</p>
<p class="bas indent1"><span class="nm">(e)</span><span class="cl">Question:</span> If one said 'this is your Get on condition that you eat pork', what is the law?</p>
<p class="bas indent1"><span class="nm">(f)</span><span class="cl">Answer #1 (Abaye):</span> Also this is a Tanai that cannot be fulfilled. (The above Tana'im argue about it.)</p>
<p class="bas indent1"><span class="nm">(g)</span><span class="cl">Answer #2 (Rava):</span> The Tanai can be fulfilled, just (it is forbidden and) she would be lashed for fulfilling it.</p>
<p class="bas indent2"><span class="nm">1.</span>Abaye explains that R. Yehudah's rule (any Tanai that cannot be fulfilled is void) includes a Tanai to eat pork.</p>
<p class="bas indent2"><span class="nm">2.</span>Rava explains that 'such a Get is valid' excludes the case of eating pork (the Get is valid only if she fulfills the Tanai).</p>
<p class="bas indent1"><span class="nm">(h)</span><span class="cl">Question (against Rava - Beraisa):</span> If one said 'this is your Get on condition that you have Bi'ah with Ploni', the Get is only valid if the Tanai is fulfilled;</p>
<p class="bas indent2"><span class="nm">1.</span>If he said 'on condition that you do not have Bi'ah with my father or your father', we are not concerned that she will (she may remarry).</p>
<p class="bas indent2"><span class="nm">2.</span>The Beraisa does not teach 'on condition that you have Bi'ah with my father or your father' (because it is forbidden, it is not a valid Tanai)!</p>
<p class="bas indent1"><span class="nm">(i)</span><span class="cl">Answer (Rava):</span> I said that a Tanai to eat pork is valid, because she can do this (just she will be lashed for it). A Tanai to have Bi'ah with Ploni is valid, for she can bribe him;</p>
<p class="bas indent2"><span class="nm">1.</span>But even if she is willing to sin, she cannot get her father or father-in-law to sin!</p>
<p class="bas indent1"><span class="nm">(j)</span>Rava explains R. Yehudah's rule (any Tanai that cannot be fulfilled) to include a Tanai to have Bi'ah with her father or father-in-law;</p>
<p class="bas indent2"><span class="nm">1.</span>'Such a Get is valid' excludes the case of eating pork.</p>
<p class="bas bbbline">84b----------------------------------------84b</p>
<p class="bas indent1"><span class="nm">(k)</span>Abaye explains that the rule includes a Tanai to eat pork;</p>
<p class="bas indent2"><span class="nm">1.</span>'Such a Get is valid' excludes a Tanai that she will have Bi'ah with Ploni.</p>
<p class="bas indent1"><span class="nm">(l)</span><span class="cl">Question (against Abaye - Beraisa):</span> If one said 'this is your Get on condition that you eat pork, eat Terumah (if she is not a Kohenes) or drink wine (if she is a Nezirah)', the Get is valid only if the Tanai is fulfilled.</p>
<p class="bas indent1"><span class="nm">(m)</span><span class="cl">Answer (Abaye):</span> The Beraisa is like Chachamim who argue with R. Yehudah.</p>
<p class="bas indent1"><span class="nm">(n)</span><span class="cl">Question:</span> The Tanai should be Pasul because it is contrary to the Torah!</p>
<p class="bas indent1"><span class="nm">(o)</span><span class="cl">Answer #1 (Rav Ada brei d'Rav Ika):</span> That rule applies only in a case such as Kidushin on condition that the husband has no obligation to supply his wife's needs for food, clothing and Onah (Bi'ah at the proper frequency), for he uproots (his Torah obligation to supply these);</p>
<p class="bas indent2"><span class="nm">1.</span>Here, she transgresses to fulfill the Tanai!</p>
<p class="bas indent1"><span class="nm">(p)</span><span class="cl">Objection (Ravina):</span> She transgresses only to fulfill his Tanai. He caused the Mitzvah to be uprooted!</p>
<p class="bas indent1"><span class="nm">(q)</span><span class="cl">Answer #2 (Ravina):</span> The rule that a Tanai contrary to the Torah is Pasul applies only in a case such as Kidushin without obligation to supply food, clothing and Onah, for he definitely uproots the Mitzvah;</p>
<p class="bas indent2"><span class="nm">1.</span>Here, the Mitzvah need not be uprooted. She need not eat, and the Get will not take effect!</p>
<p class="bas subject"><span class="nm">3)</span>A <i>TANAI</i> NOT TO MARRY PLONI</p>
<p class="bas indent1"><span class="nm">(a)</span><span class="cl">(Mishnah):</span> He takes the Get back...</p>
<p class="bas indent1"><span class="nm">(b)</span><span class="cl">Question:</span> Like whom is our Tana?</p>
<p class="bas indent1"><span class="nm">(c)</span><span class="cl">Answer #1 (Chizkiyah):</span> He holds like R. Shimon ben Elazar.</p>
<p class="bas indent2"><span class="nm">1.</span><span class="cl">(Beraisa - R. Shimon ben Elazar):</span> (If one told his wife 'take this loan document' and gave a Get to her,) it is valid only if he takes it back and gives it again, and says 'this is your Get.'</p>
<p class="bas indent1"><span class="nm">(d)</span><span class="cl">Answer #2 (R. Yochanan):</span> Our Mishnah is even like Rebbi (there, who does not require taking it back and giving it again);</p>
<p class="bas indent2"><span class="nm">1.</span>The reason is like Rav Kahana taught. Here, the Get (partially) took effect to disqualify her to Kohanim, so she already acquired it. (It does not help to say now that she is permitted to all men, unless he takes it back and gives it again.)</p>
<p class="bas indent1"><span class="nm">(e)</span><span class="cl">(Mishnah):</span> If he wrote in the Get (that she is not permitted to Ploni, even if this was later erased, the Get is Pasul).</p>
<p class="bas indent1"><span class="nm">(f)</span><span class="cl">Opinion #1 (Rav Safra):</span> The Mishnah discusses when he wrote the Tanai in the Get.</p>
<p class="bas indent1"><span class="nm">(g)</span><span class="cl">Question:</span> This is obvious! The Mishnah explicitly says so!</p>
<p class="bas indent1"><span class="nm">(h)</span><span class="cl">Answer:</span> One might have thought that the Mishnah applies only when the Tanai was written after the Toref (the primary part of the Get), but if the Tanai preceded the Toref, even if the Tanai was not written in the Get, the Get is Pasul;</p>
<p class="bas indent2"><span class="nm">1.</span>Rav Safra teaches that this is not so. (Rather, even a Tanai before the Toref does not disqualify the Get if it is not written in the Get. The Toref is 'you are permitted to every man' (Tur), or, if this in not in the Get (Beis Yosef Sof 126 DH v'Harei), similar expressions of Kerisus. A Tanai after the Toref is like a Tanai after the Ma'aseh. We hold like R. Meir, that normally, such a Tanai is invalid.)</p>
<p class="bas indent1"><span class="nm">(i)</span><span class="cl">Opinion #2 (Rava):</span> The Mishnah is only when he wrote the Tanai after the Toref. If the Tanai precedes the Toref, even if it was not written in the Get, the Get is Pasul.</p>
<p class="bas indent2"><span class="nm">1.</span>For this reason, Rava would silence the husband until the Toref was written.</p>
<p class="bas indent1"><span class="nm">(j)</span><span class="cl">(Beraisa - Rebbi):</span> Any Tanai disqualifies a Get;</p>
<p class="bas indent1"><span class="nm">(k)</span>Chachamim say, only a Tanai that disqualifies a Get orally, disqualifies it when it is written in it:</p>
<p class="bas indent2"><span class="nm">1.</span>'Except for marrying Ploni', disqualifies orally, and it disqualifies also if it is written;</p>
<p class="bas indent2"><span class="nm">2.</span>'On condition that you don't marry Ploni' does not disqualify orally, so it does not disqualify if it is written.</p>
