<p class="bas subject"><span class="nm">1)</span>SELLING SMALL ANIMALS TO NOCHRIM (cont.)</p>
<p class="bas indent1"><span class="nm">(a)</span><span class="cl">Answer #2 (R. Elazar):</span> Even though it is always forbidden to leave animals with them, selling is permitted (except in places where custom is not to sell).</p>
<p class="bas indent1"><span class="nm">(b)</span><span class="cl">Question:</span> What is the reason?</p>
<p class="bas indent1"><span class="nm">(c)</span><span class="cl">Answer:</span> A Nochrim would not sleep with his own animal, for this makes it sterile.</p>
<p class="bas indent1"><span class="nm">(d)</span>Rav retracted and agreed with R. Elazar.</p>
<p class="bas indent2"><span class="nm">1.</span><span class="cl">(Rav Tachlifa citing Rav):</span> A Nochri is concerned lest his animal become sterile.</p>
<p class="bas subject"><span class="nm">2)</span>SELLING LARGE ANIMALS TO NOCHRIM</p>
<p class="bas indent1"><span class="nm">(a)</span><span class="cl">(Mishnah):</span> In all places one may not sell large animals...</p>
<p class="bas indent1"><span class="nm">(b)</span><span class="cl">Question:</span> What is the reason?</p>
<p class="bas indent1"><span class="nm">(c)</span><span class="cl">Answer #1:</span> Granted, they are not suspected of bestiality, but they would work with the animal on Shabbos.</p>
<p class="bas indent1"><span class="nm">(d)</span><span class="cl">Objection:</span> Once the Nochri acquires the animal, it is his. The animal may work on Shabbos!</p>
<p class="bas indent1"><span class="nm">(e)</span><span class="cl">Answer #2:</span> This is a decree, lest one rent or lend an animal to a Nochri.</p>
<p class="bas indent1"><span class="nm">(f)</span><span class="cl">Objection:</span> Also one who rents or borrows an animal acquires it (for that period of time)!</p>
<p class="bas indent1"><span class="nm">(g)</span><span class="cl">Answer #3 (Rami brei d'R. Yeva):</span> This is a decree, lest the Nochri want to test the animal;</p>
<p class="bas indent2"><span class="nm">1.</span>Sometimes he buys an animal just before Shabbos, and wants to see how the animal carries burdens. The animal will go when it hears its owner's voice. The owner transgresses Mechamer (making an animal work on Shabbos), for which (b'Shogeg) one brings a Chatas.</p>
<p class="bas indent1"><span class="nm">(h)</span><span class="cl">Question (Rav Shisha brei d'Rav Idi):</span> Rental does not acquire!</p>
<p class="bas indent2"><span class="nm">1.</span><span class="cl">(Mishnah):</span> Even where one may rent houses to Nochrim, he may not rent for the Nochri to dwell in, for the Nochri would bring in his idols. (A Yisrael may not have idols in his house.)</p>
<p class="bas indent2"><span class="nm">2.</span>If rental acquires, the idols are in the Nochri's house!</p>
<p class="bas indent1"><span class="nm">(i)</span><span class="cl">Answer:</span> Normally, rental acquires. Idolatry is an exception. It is more stringent - "v'Lo Savi So'evah El Beisecha."</p>
<p class="bas indent1"><span class="nm">(j)</span><span class="cl">Objection (R. Yitzchak brei d'Rav Mesharshiya):</span> Rental does not acquire!</p>
<p class="bas indent2"><span class="nm">1.</span><span class="cl">(Mishnah):</span> If a Yisrael rents a cow from a Kohen, he may feed it vetch of Terumah. (Vetch (horsebean) is normally fed to animals, but people can eat it.) If a Kohen rents a cow from a Yisrael, even though the Kohen must feed it, he may not feed it vetch of Terumah.</p>
<p class="bas indent2"><span class="nm">2.</span>If rental acquires, the Kohen owns the cow. He should be allowed to feed it vetch of Terumah!</p>
<p class="bas indent1"><span class="nm">(k)</span>Indeed, this shows that rental does not acquire.</p>
<p class="bas indent1"><span class="nm">(l)</span><span class="cl">Answer #4:</span> The decree was due to rental, lending and testing the animal.</p>
<p class="bas indent1"><span class="nm">(m)</span>Rav Ada permitted selling a donkey through a Safsira (one who buys and sells animals):</p>
<p class="bas indent2"><span class="nm">1.</span>We are not concerned lest the Nochri want to test the animal, because the animal does not recognize the Safsira's voice;</p>
<p class="bas indent2"><span class="nm">2.</span>We are not concerned lest the Safsira rent or lend it out, because it is not his. Also, he does not want defects of the animal to become known.</p>
<p class="bas subject"><span class="nm">3)</span>MAKING LENIENT ASSUMPTIONS</p>
<p class="bas indent1"><span class="nm">(a)</span>Rav Huna sold a cow to a Nochri.</p>
<p class="bas indent1"><span class="nm">(b)</span><span class="cl">Rav Chisda:</span> Why is this permitted?</p>
<p class="bas indent1"><span class="nm">(c)</span><span class="cl">Rav Huna:</span> I may assume that he bought it to eat it immediately.</p>
<p class="bas bbbline">15b----------------------------------------15b</p>
<p class="bas indent1"><span class="nm">(d)</span><span class="cl">Question:</span> What is the source that we can be lenient to say this?</p>
<p class="bas indent1"><span class="nm">(e)</span><span class="cl">Answer #1 (Mishnah - Beis Shamai):</span> In Shemitah, one may not sell a cow suitable for plowing to someone suspected of working in Shemitah;</p>
<p class="bas indent2"><span class="nm">1.</span>Beis Hillel permit this. He may assume that the buyer wants to eat it.</p>
<p class="bas indent1"><span class="nm">(f)</span><span class="cl">Rejection (Rabah):</span> That is different, because one is not commanded that his animals rest in Shemitah. (Even if the buyer works with it, the seller does not transgress.)</p>
<p class="bas indent2"><span class="nm">1.</span>One is commanded that his animals rest on Shabbos (so he may not assume that the buyer wants to eat it, lest the buyer work with it, and the seller transgresses.)</p>
<p class="bas indent1"><span class="nm">(g)</span><span class="cl">Objection #1 (Abaye):</span> Even when one is commanded, sometimes he may make favorable assumptions!</p>
<p class="bas indent2"><span class="nm">1.</span>One is commanded that his field rest in Shemitah;</p>
<p class="bas indent2"><span class="nm">2.</span><span class="cl">(Mishnah - Beis Shamai):</span> One may not sell a plowed field in Shemitah to someone suspected of working in Shemitah;</p>
<p class="bas indent2"><span class="nm">3.</span>Beis Hillel permit this. He may assume that the buyer wants to leave it fallow until the following year.</p>
<p class="bas indent1"><span class="nm">(h)</span><span class="cl">Objection #2 (Rav Ashi):</span> Even when one is not commanded, sometimes he may not make favorable assumptions!</p>
<p class="bas indent2"><span class="nm">1.</span>One is not commanded that his Kelim rest in Shemitah;</p>
<p class="bas indent2"><span class="nm">2.</span><span class="cl">(Mishnah):</span> One may not sell the following Kelim in Shemitah (Ran - to someone suspected of working in Shemitah): a plow and all Kelim used with it, a yoke, a shovel, or a hoe (Tosfos - the latter two refer to parts of a plow).</p>
<p class="bas indent1"><span class="nm">(i)</span><span class="cl">Answer #2 (Rav Ashi):</span> Rather, whenever we can attribute the buyer's intention to something permitted, we may be lenient. If not, we must be stringent (people do not buy Kelim a year before they need them);</p>
<p class="bas indent2"><span class="nm">1.</span>It makes no difference whether or not the seller is commanded.</p>
<p class="bas indent1"><span class="nm">(j)</span>Rabah sold a donkey to someone suspected of selling to Nochrim.</p>
<p class="bas indent1"><span class="nm">(k)</span><span class="cl">Abaye:</span> Why did you do this?</p>
<p class="bas indent1"><span class="nm">(l)</span><span class="cl">Rabah:</span> I sold to a Yisrael!</p>
<p class="bas indent1"><span class="nm">(m)</span><span class="cl">Abaye:</span> He will sell to a Nochri!</p>
<p class="bas indent1"><span class="nm">(n)</span><span class="cl">Rabah:</span> He might, but also he might sell to a Yisrael. Therefore, I may assume the latter.</p>
<p class="bas indent1"><span class="nm">(o)</span><span class="cl">Question (Beraisa):</span> In a place where the custom is to sell small animals to Kusim (the people that Sancheriv settled in place of the 10 exiled Shevatim. They later converted, but they did not accept Divrei Chachamim), we may sell. In a place where the custom is not to sell, it is forbidden.</p>
<p class="bas indent2"><span class="nm">1.</span><span class="cl">Question:</span> What is the reason?</p>
<p class="bas indent3"><span class="nm">i.</span><span class="cl">Suggestion:</span> Kusim are suspected of bestiality.</p>
<p class="bas indent2"><span class="nm">2.</span><span class="cl">Rejection #1 (Beraisa):</span> We may not leave an animal with a Nochri innkeeper, even a male with a male or a female with a female (lest a man come looking for her, and not find her, and have relations with it instead), and all the more so if the animal is the opposite gender;</p>
<p class="bas indent3"><span class="nm">i.</span>We may not leave an animal with a Nochri shepherd. One may not be secluded with a Nochri (lest the Nochri kill him), we do not ask a Nochri to teach a child to read or a trade (lest he veer the child to heresy, or have relations with him);</p>
<p class="bas indent3"><span class="nm">ii.</span>All of these are permitted regarding Kusim.</p>
<p class="bas indent2"><span class="nm">3.</span><span class="cl">Rejection #2 (Beraisa):</span> We may not sell to Nochrim or Kusim weapons nor handles of weapons. We do not sharpen their weapons. We do not sell to them shackles and chains (for holding prisoners).</p>
<p class="bas indent2"><span class="nm">4.</span><span class="cl">Question:</span> Why may we not sell to Kusim?</p>
<p class="bas indent3"><span class="nm">i.</span><span class="cl">Suggestion:</span> They are suspected of killing.</p>
<p class="bas indent3"><span class="nm">ii.</span><span class="cl">Rejection:</span> One may be secluded with them!</p>
<p class="bas indent2"><span class="nm">5.</span><span class="cl">Answer (also to Question o:1):</span> Rather, it is because they sell them to Nochrim.</p>
<p class="bas indent2"><span class="nm">6.</span><span class="cl">Suggestion:</span> Perhaps we are concerned only about Kusim, but we assume that a Yisrael (even though he is suspected) will repent and not sell to Nochrim.</p>
<p class="bas indent2"><span class="nm">7.</span><span class="cl">Rejection:</span> Rav Nachman taught that just like one may not sell to a Nochri, also to a Yisrael suspected of selling to Nochrim.</p>
<p class="bas indent1"><span class="nm">(p)</span>Rabah ran three Parsa'os (some say - a Parsah in sand) to retract the sale, but was unable to catch the buyer.</p>
<p class="bas subject"><span class="nm">4)</span>SELLING WEAPONS TO NOCHRIM</p>
<p class="bas indent1"><span class="nm">(a)</span><span class="cl">(Rav Dimi):</span> Just like one may not sell to a Nochri, also to a Yisrael robber.</p>
<p class="bas indent2"><span class="nm">1.</span><span class="cl">Question:</span> What is the case?</p>
<p class="bas indent3"><span class="nm">i.</span>If the robber is suspected of murder, this is obvious. He is like a Nochri!</p>
<p class="bas indent3"><span class="nm">ii.</span>If he does not murder, why it is forbidden?</p>
<p class="bas indent2"><span class="nm">2.</span><span class="cl">Answer:</span> He does not (Ran - want to) kill, but if his victim contests him, he will fight him. (Weapons will help him to keep the money (Rashi) or kill the victim (Ran).)</p>
<p class="bas indent1"><span class="nm">(b)</span><span class="cl">(Beraisa):</span> We do not sell shields to Nochrim. Some permit.</p>
<p class="bas indent1"><span class="nm">(c)</span><span class="cl">Question:</span> Why does the first opinion forbid?</p>
<p class="bas indent1"><span class="nm">(d)</span><span class="cl">Version #1 - Answer:</span> It helps them to survive.</p>
<p class="bas indent1"><span class="nm">(e)</span><span class="cl">Question:</span> If so, it should be forbidden to sell also grain to them!</p>
<p class="bas indent1"><span class="nm">(f)</span><span class="cl">Answer (Rav):</span> Indeed, if one can avoid selling grain (without causing animosity), he should not sell!</p>
