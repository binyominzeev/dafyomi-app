<div class="subject"><span class="nm">1)</span><p>PROUD BRIDGE-BUILDERS</p></div>
<div class="indent1"><span class="nm">(a)</span><p><span class="cl">(R. Chaninah):</span> The Kohanim Gedolim had excessive pride in their refusal to use the bridges built by their predecessors, rather, they each built it anew, at enormous expense.</p></div>
<div class="indent1"><span class="nm">(b)</span><p><span class="cl">Question:</span> But Shimon HaTzadik constructed a second bridge when he brought a second Parah Adumah!?</p></div>
<div class="indent1"><span class="nm">(c)</span><p><span class="cl">Question:</span> Then why did the great Tzadik do so?</p></div>
<div class="indent1"><span class="nm">(d)</span><p><span class="cl">Answer:</span> To impart greatness and honor to the Parah Adumah.</p></div>
<div class="indent1"><span class="nm">(e)</span><p>We were taught that abutments to the bridge made it impossible for Kohanim to peer over the edge and (possibly) become Tamei.</p></div>
<div class="subject"><span class="nm">2)</span><p>PROFITING FROM HEKDESH</p></div>
<div class="indent1"><span class="nm">(a)</span><p>R. Akiva did not permit the arrangement (buying and selling wine and oil with the Shirayim) fearing losses to Hekdesh.</p></div>
<div class="indent1"><span class="nm">(b)</span><p>If, however, one were to give only profits to Hekdesh while absorbing any losses to himself, it would be permitted.</p></div>
<div class="indent1"><span class="nm">(c)</span><p>R. Mana issued a similar ruling regarding the funds of orphans.</p></div>
<div class="indent1"><span class="nm">(d)</span><p>R. Chiya was entrusted with orphan's funds, and absorbed any loss while dividing the profit with the orphans.</p></div>
<div class="subject"><span class="nm">3)</span><p>UNDERSTANDING MOSAR PEIROS</p></div>
<div class="indent1"><span class="nm">(a)</span><p>The Mishnah is the opinion of R. Yishmael.</p></div>
<div class="indent2"><span class="nm">1.</span><p><span class="cl">(R. Chiya):</span> Mosar Peiros means profits to Hekdesh.</p></div>
<div class="indent2"><span class="nm">2.</span><p>Mosar Nesachim (about which there is a dispute whether it goes for K'lei Shares or for Kayitz) means the fourth Se'ah.</p></div>
<div class="indent2"><span class="nm">3.</span><p><span class="cl">(R. Yochanan):</span> Mosar Peiros is the fourth Se'ah.</p></div>
<div class="indent2"><span class="nm">4.</span><p>Mosar Nesachim is Beirutzim.</p></div>
<div class="indent1"><span class="nm">(b)</span><p><span class="cl">Question:</span> Does R. Chiya not learn the law of Beirutzim?</p></div>
<div class="indent1"><span class="nm">(c)</span><p><span class="cl">Answer:</span> It is identical to the fourth Se'ah.</p></div>
<div class="indent1"><span class="nm">(d)</span><p><span class="cl">Question:</span> When, according to R. Yochanan, will R. Akiva and R. Chanina, not admit the Peiros (which R. Yochanan understands to mean the fourth Se'ah), we know that the fourth Se'ah is permitted, and Peiros <i>are</i> quite admissible!?</p></div>
<div class="indent1"><span class="nm">(e)</span><p><span class="cl">Answer:</span> They only rejected the use of Peiros for Kayitz.</p></div>
<div class="subject"><span class="nm">4)</span><p>BEIRUTZIM</p></div>
<div class="indent1"><span class="nm">(a)</span><p>Would we even allow the Beirutzim from an <i>individual</i> to be used to purchase K'lei Shares (there is no precedent for this)?</p></div>
<div class="indent1"><span class="nm">(b)</span><p><span class="cl">Answer:</span> Like the women weaving the Kesones, it is given fully to the Tzibur.</p></div>
<div class="indent1"><span class="nm">(c)</span><p><span class="cl">Question:</span> What would the Din be by dry Beirutzim?</p></div>
<div class="indent1"><span class="nm">(d)</span><p><span class="cl">Answer:</span> We can demonstrate that only that which has been sanctified in a K'li Shares is Kadosh, and not the dry overflow (this is supported by a Beraisa).</p></div>
<div class="subject"><span class="nm">5)</span><p>HALACHAH 3: THE SURPLUS KETORES</p></div>
<div class="indent1"><span class="nm">(a)</span><p>The surplus Ketores was used to pay the workers who prepared it.</p></div>
<div class="indent2"><span class="nm">1.</span><p>This necessitated being Mechalel the Kedushah of the Ketores on the salary funds.</p></div>
<div class="indent2"><span class="nm">2.</span><p>The Ketores was then given to the workers.</p></div>
<div class="indent2"><span class="nm">3.</span><p>The Ketores, in turn, was purchased back from them with new Terumah funds (or old, depending on when the new Terumah came in).</p></div>
<div class="subject"><span class="nm">6)</span><p>COMPLICATIONS SURROUNDING BEING MECHALEL THE KETORES</p></div>
<div class="indent1"><span class="nm">(a)</span><p><span class="cl">Question:</span> How can we be Mechalel Hekdesh (the Ketores) on Hekdesh (Terumah funds)?</p></div>
<div class="indent1"><span class="nm">(b)</span><p><span class="cl">Answer:</span> Other funds are brought and are Mechulal on the building.</p></div>
<div class="bbbline">11b----------------------------------------11b</p></div>
<div class="indent1"><span class="nm">(c)</span><p>Rebbi holds that a debt may be used to be Mechalel the coins and so the Terumah may be given directly to the workers</p></div>
<div class="indent2"><span class="nm">1.</span><p>The workers of the houses of Garmu and Avtinas.</p></div>
<div class="indent2"><span class="nm">2.</span><p>They would be Mechalel the Ketores, etc.</p></div>
<div class="indent2"><span class="nm">3.</span><p>This is all provided that the salaries are already due.</p></div>
<div class="indent1"><span class="nm">(d)</span><p><span class="cl">Question (R. Chiya):</span> What would be done with the surplus if salaries are not yet due?</p></div>
<div class="indent1"><span class="nm">(e)</span><p><span class="cl">Answer (R. Chiya):</span> They would be Mechulal on animals for Kayitz.</p></div>
<div class="indent1"><span class="nm">(f)</span><p><span class="cl">Question:</span> Was R. Chiya in doubt or not?!</p></div>
<div class="indent1"><span class="nm">(g)</span><p><span class="cl">Answer:</span> He was in doubt whether the surplus Ketores was like the surplus Nesachim (K'lei Shares).</p></div>
<div class="indent1"><span class="nm">(h)</span><p>This is, indeed, a Machlokes regarding the Kashrus of Ketores which was pounded in a K'li Chol.</p></div>
<div class="indent2"><span class="nm">1.</span><p>R. Yosi b. R. Chanina said it is Pesulah.</p></div>
<div class="indent2"><span class="nm">2.</span><p>R. Yehoshua b. Levi said it is Kesheirah.</p></div>
<div class="indent1"><span class="nm">(i)</span><p>Their dispute is over how to interpret the Pasuk (Shemos 30:37).</p></div>
<div class="indent1"><span class="nm">(j)</span><p><span class="cl">(R. Yusa):</span> Their dispute seems to parallel other opinions.</p></div>
<div class="indent2"><span class="nm">1.</span><p>R. Yosi b. Chaninah is like Shmuel (see 4. below).</p></div>
<div class="indent2"><span class="nm">2.</span><p>R. Yehoshua b. Levi is like R. Yochanan in the upcoming Mishnah who indicates that Ketores prepared as Chulin is Kesheirah.</p></div>
<div class="indent2"><span class="nm">3.</span><p>R. Yosi may be defended by saying that we are speaking of workers receiving their pay in Ketores.</p></div>
<div class="indent2"><span class="nm">4.</span><p>Shmuel had taught that the hammer for pounding the Ketores is considered a Keli Shares.</p></div>
<div class="indent2"><span class="nm">5.</span><p><span class="cl">Question:</span> Can the Ketores then be redeemed?!</p></div>
<div class="indent2"><span class="nm">6.</span><p><span class="cl">Answer:</span> It is Shmuel's opinion that we are lenient regarding surplus.</p></div>
<div class="indent3"><span class="nm">i.</span><p>The position of Shmuel pertains to the Halachah of surplus unblemished animals set aside for the Tamid.</p></div>
<div class="indent3"><span class="nm">ii.</span><p>Shmuel holds they are redeemed as unblemished.</p></div>
<div class="indent3"><span class="nm">iii.</span><p>R. Yochanan holds they are redeemed like Pesulei HaMukdashin.</p></div>
<div class="indent1"><span class="nm">(k)</span><p>If Se'irim (Chatas) are left over:</p></div>
<div class="indent2"><span class="nm">1.</span><p>We infer that Shmuel would certainly permit them to be redeemed.</p></div>
<div class="indent2"><span class="nm">2.</span><p>We assume that R. Yochanan would send them to pasture.</p></div>
<div class="indent2"><span class="nm">3.</span><p>R. Shmuel b. Yitzhok makes them Kayitz.</p></div>
<div class="indent2"><span class="nm">4.</span><p><span class="cl">Question:</span> Can a Chatas be brought as an Olah?!</p></div>
<div class="indent2"><span class="nm">5.</span><p><span class="cl">Answer (R. Yusa):</span> Korbanos Tzibur are unique in that they are only designated at the Shechitah.</p></div>
<div class="indent2"><span class="nm">6.</span><p><span class="cl">Answer (R. Chiya):</span> No, it is rather a condition of Beis Din.</p></div>
