<p class="bas subject"><span class="nm">1)</span>LEWD TALK OF THE MEN</p>
<p class="bas indent1"><span class="nm">(a)</span><span class="cl">(Rav Yehudah):</span> Men of Yerushalayim would haughtily discuss their sexual affairs [through allusions]:</p>
<p class="bas indent2"><span class="nm">1.</span>'Did you eat well kneaded bread, or poorly kneaded bread (was she Be'ulah, or a virgin)?'</p>
<p class="bas indent2"><span class="nm">2.</span>'Did you drink white wine, or black (what color was she)?'</p>
<p class="bas indent2"><span class="nm">3.</span>'Did you recline on a wide bed, or a thin bed (was she fat or thin)?'</p>
<p class="bas indent2"><span class="nm">4.</span>'Did you eat with good company, or bad (was she attractive)?'</p>
<p class="bas indent1"><span class="nm">(b)</span><span class="cl">(Rav Chisda):</span> All of these refer to Zenus.</p>
<p class="bas indent1"><span class="nm">(c)</span><span class="cl">(Rachbah):</span> There used to be cinnamon trees in Yerushalayim, they would give a nice smell when burned - they were hidden after the Churban, only [wood the size of] a barley seed remains, in the treasury of the queen Tzimtzemai.</p>
<p class="bas subject"><span class="nm">2)</span>CARRYING WEAPONS OF WAR</p>
<p class="bas indent1"><span class="nm">(a)</span><span class="cl">(Mishnah):</span> A man may not go out with a sword, bow, shield, Alah (club) or spear; if he did, he is Chayav Chatas;</p>
<p class="bas indent1"><span class="nm">(b)</span>R. Eliezer says, these are Tachshitim for him;</p>
<p class="bas indent1"><span class="nm">(c)</span>Chachamim say, they are a disgrace - "V'Chitsu Charvosam l'Itim...Lo Yisa Goy El Goy Cherev v'Lo Yilmedu Od Milchamah".</p>
<p class="bas indent1"><span class="nm">(d)</span>A Biris is Tahor, one may go out with it; Kevalim are Teme'im, one may not go out with them (these will be explained).</p>
<p class="bas indent1"><span class="nm">(e)</span><span class="cl">(Gemara):</span> Alah is a club.</p>
<p class="bas indent1"><span class="nm">(f)</span><span class="cl">(Mishnah - R. Eliezer):</span> These are Tachshitim for him;</p>
<p class="bas indent1"><span class="nm">(g)</span><span class="cl">Version #1 (Beraisa - Chachamim):</span> If they are Tachshitim, why will they be Batul in the time of Moshi'ach?</p>
<p class="bas indent1"><span class="nm">(h)</span><span class="cl">R. Eliezer:</span> They will not be needed - "Lo Yisa Goy El Goy Cherev".</p>
<p class="bas indent1"><span class="nm">(i)</span><span class="cl">Question:</span> [If they are Tachshitim, even if they are unnecessary] they should be permitted, for Noy!</p>
<p class="bas indent1"><span class="nm">(j)</span><span class="cl">Answer (Abaye):</span> This is like a Ner in daylight (since it is useless, it is not Noy).</p>
<p class="bas indent1"><span class="nm">(k)</span><span class="cl">The Beraisa is unlike Shmuel:</span> (Rashash - the Beraisa is not considered a question against him, for the text could be errant (R. Chiya and R. Oshaya did not authenticate it), or because Shmuel's teaching does not affect Halachah.)</p>
<p class="bas indent2"><span class="nm">1.</span><span class="cl">(Shmuel):</span> The only difference between this world and Yemos ha'Moshi'ach is that the kingdoms will cease to rule over Yisrael - "Ki Lo Yechdal Evyon mi'Kerev ha'Aretz".</p>
<p class="bas indent1"><span class="nm">(l)</span>The Beraisa supports R. Chiya bar Aba:</p>
<p class="bas indent2"><span class="nm">1.</span><span class="cl">(R. Chiya bar Aba):</span> Nevi'im prophesized about Yemos ha'Moshi'ach, but not about the world to come - "Ayin Lo Ra'asah Elokim Zulasecha Ya'aseh li'Mchakeh Lo".</p>
<p class="bas indent1"><span class="nm">(m)</span><span class="cl">Version #2 (Beraisa - Chachamim):</span> If they are Tachshitim, why will they be Batul in the time of Moshi'ach?</p>
<p class="bas indent1"><span class="nm">(n)</span><span class="cl">R. Eliezer:</span> They will not be Batul then ("Lo Yisa Goy..." refers to the world to come).</p>
<p class="bas indent1"><span class="nm">(o)</span>The Beraisa is like Shmuel, it is unlike R. Chiya bar Aba.</p>
<p class="bas indent1"><span class="nm">(p)</span><span class="cl">Question (Abaye):</span> What is R. Eliezer's source that they are Tachshitim?</p>
<p class="bas indent1"><span class="nm">(q)</span><span class="cl">Answer (Rav Dimi):</span> "Chagor Charbecha Al Yarech Gibor Hodcha va'Hadarecha".</p>
<p class="bas indent1"><span class="nm">(r)</span><span class="cl">Question (Rav Kahana):</span> The verse refers to words of Torah!</p>
<p class="bas indent1"><span class="nm">(s)</span><span class="cl">Answer (Mar brei d'Rav Huna):</span> The simple meaning of the verse is [always] true [as well].</p>
<p class="bas subject"><span class="nm">3)</span>HOW CHACHAMIM SHOULD LEARN</p>
<p class="bas indent1"><span class="nm">(a)</span><span class="cl">Rav Kahana:</span> I learned all of Shas (oral Torah) by the age of 18, yet I did not know that the simple meaning of the verse is [always] true (even if it is a metaphor or Shirah (Maharitz Chiyus) or parable (Anaf Yosef)).</p>
<p class="bas indent1"><span class="nm">(b)</span><span class="cl">Question:</span> What do we learn from this?</p>
<p class="bas indent1"><span class="nm">(c)</span><span class="cl">Answer:</span> One should first learn (memorize teachings from his Rebbi), and later understand them [fully].</p>
<p class="bas indent1"><span class="nm">(d)</span><span class="cl">(R. Yirmeyah):</span> If two Chachamim sharpen each other in Halachah, Hash-m prospers them - "<i>V'Hadarcha Tzelach</i> - we read this 'V'Chidadcha' ('Hei' and 'Ches' are interchangeable, also 'Reish' and 'Dalet'.)</p>
<p class="bas indent2"><span class="nm">1.</span>Moreover, they will become great - "Tzelaf Rechav".</p>
<p class="bas indent1"><span class="nm">(e)</span><span class="cl">Suggestion:</span> Perhaps this is even if they learn Lo Lishmah!</p>
<p class="bas indent1"><span class="nm">(f)</span><span class="cl">Rejection:</span> "Al Devar Emes".</p>
<p class="bas indent1"><span class="nm">(g)</span><span class="cl">Suggestion:</span> Perhaps this is even if he gets haughty!</p>
<p class="bas indent1"><span class="nm">(h)</span><span class="cl">Rejection:</span> "V'Anvah Tzedek".</p>
<p class="bas indent1"><span class="nm">(i)</span>If they do so, they merit Torah which was given by Hash-m's right hand - "V'Sorcha Nora'os Yeminecha".</p>
<p class="bas indent1"><span class="nm">(j)</span><span class="cl">(Rav Nachman bar Yitzchak):</span> They merit things which were said regarding the right ['hand'] of Torah:</p>
<p class="bas indent2"><span class="nm">1.</span><span class="cl">(Rabah bar Rav Shila) Question:</span> "Orech Yamim bi'Minah bi'Smolah Osher v'Chavod" - does the right [hand] of Torah only give length of days, but not wealth and honor?!</p>
<p class="bas indent2"><span class="nm">2.</span><span class="cl">Answer:</span> Those who are Maimin (meticulous, like the skilled right hand; alternatively, Lishmah) regarding Torah get length of days, all the more so wealth and honor;</p>
<p class="bas indent3"><span class="nm">i.</span>Those who are Masmilin (lethargic; alternatively, Lo Lishmah) regarding Torah get wealth and honor, but not length of days.</p>
<p class="bas indent1"><span class="nm">(k)</span><span class="cl">(R. Yirmeyah):</span> If two Chachamim learn Halachah together gently, Hash-m listens to them - "Az Nidberu Yir'ei Hash-m...";</p>
<p class="bas indent2"><span class="nm">1.</span>'Dibur' means gently - "Yadber Amim Tachtenu".</p>
<p class="bas indent1"><span class="nm">(l)</span><span class="cl">Question:</span> What does it mean "Ul'Choshvei Shemo"?</p>
<p class="bas indent1"><span class="nm">(m)</span><span class="cl">Answer (R. Ami):</span> Even if he intended to do a Mitzvah and was Ne'enas (unable to), the Torah considers it as if he did it.</p>
<p class="bas indent1"><span class="nm">(n)</span><span class="cl">(R. Chanina bar Idi):</span> Anyone who does a Mitzvah the way it was commanded will not hear bad tidings - "Shomer Mitzvah Lo Yeda Davar Ra".</p>
<p class="bas indent1"><span class="nm">(o)</span><span class="cl">(Rav Asi):</span> Even if Hash-m had made a harsh decree on him, He will tear it up - it says "Ba'Asher Devar Melech Shilton u'Mi Yomar Lo Mah Ta'aseh", and then "Shomer Mitzvah Lo Yeda Davar Ra".</p>
<p class="bas indent1"><span class="nm">(p)</span><span class="cl">(R. Ami):</span> If two Chachamim hearken to each other in Halachah, Hash-m listens to them - "Ha'Yosheves ba'Ganim Chaverim Makshivim l'Kolech Hashmi'ini";</p>
<p class="bas indent2"><span class="nm">1.</span>If they do not hearken to each other, the Shechinah departs from Yisrael - "Berach Dodi..."</p>
<p class="bas indent2"><span class="nm">2.</span><span class="cl">(R. Aba):</span> If two Chachamim gather together to learn Halachah, Hash-m loves them - "V'Diglo Alai Ahavah".</p>
<p class="bas indent1"><span class="nm">(q)</span><span class="cl">(Rava):</span> This is only if they already learned some of the matter from a Rebbi, and they do not have a Rebbi here.</p>
<p class="bas subject"><span class="nm">4)</span>WHAT TO APPROACH AND WHAT TO AVOID</p>
<p class="bas indent1"><span class="nm">(a)</span><span class="cl">(R. Aba):</span> One who lends money is greater than one who gives Tzedakah [because the receiver is less embarrassed]; best of all is one who invests money [and the receiver does business with it, and they split the profits].</p>
<p class="bas indent1"><span class="nm">(b)</span><span class="cl">(R. Aba):</span> If a Chacham takes vengeance like a snake, cling to him; (Anaf Yosef (Yoma 23A) - he avenges the insult to Torah without personal benefit, like a snake kills and does not eat; Maharsha - he takes a small vengeance for a great offense - "Hu Yeshufcha Rosh v'Ata Teshufenu Akev");</p>
<p class="bas indent2"><span class="nm">1.</span>Do not live near an ignoramus [who tries to go beyond the letter of the law, to be a] Chasid (he can make great mistakes).</p>
<p class="bas indent1"><span class="nm">(c)</span><span class="cl">(Rav Kahana):</span> One who raises an evil dog in his house inhibits Chesed from his household (the poor are afraid to come) - "La'Mas me'Re'ehu Chased", in Yevanis 'Lamas' means dog.</p>
<p class="bas bbbline">63b----------------------------------------63b</p>
<p class="bas indent1"><span class="nm">(d)</span><span class="cl">(Rav Nachman bar Yitzchak):</span> He casts Yir'as Shamayim off himself - "V'Yir'as Shakai Ya'azov".</p>
<p class="bas indent1"><span class="nm">(e)</span>A pregnant woman entered a man's house to [borrow his oven] to bake bread; his dog barked at her - the fetus was uprooted from its place.</p>
<p class="bas indent2"><span class="nm">1.</span><span class="cl">The man:</span> Don't worry, his incisors and claws were removed!</p>
<p class="bas indent2"><span class="nm">2.</span><span class="cl">The woman:</span> That does not help - the fetus was already uprooted (aborted).</p>
<p class="bas indent1"><span class="nm">(f)</span><span class="cl">Question (Rav Huna):</span> How do we explain "Semach Bachur b'Yaldusecha vi'Tivcha Libcha bi'Mei Vechurosecha v'Halech b'Darchei Libcha uv'Mar'ei Einecha v'Da Ki Al Kol Elah Yevi'acha Elokim ba'Mishpat"?</p>
<p class="bas indent1"><span class="nm">(g)</span><span class="cl">Answer #1 (Rav Huna):</span> The Reisha (until 'v'Da') is the enticement of the Yetzer ha'Ra [to indulge in every desire] - afterwards are the words of the Yetzer Tov [that one will be judged for everything];</p>
<p class="bas indent1"><span class="nm">(h)</span><span class="cl">Answer #2 (Reish Lakish):</span> The Reisha discusses Divrei Torah (one should learn whatever he desires) - afterwards it discusses good deeds (Rashi - one will be judged about how well he fulfilled what he learned; Maharsha - he is also judged about his learning - "V'Halech..." discusses deeds, "... Yevi'acha Elokim ba'Mishpat" applies to learning and deeds).</p>
<p class="bas subject"><span class="nm">5)</span>BIRIS AND KEVALIM</p>
<p class="bas indent1"><span class="nm">(a)</span><span class="cl">(Mishnah):</span> A Biris is Tahor...</p>
<p class="bas indent1"><span class="nm">(b)</span><span class="cl">(Rav Yehudah):</span> This is a bracelet.</p>
<p class="bas indent1"><span class="nm">(c)</span><span class="cl">Question (Rav Yosef - Mishnah):</span> A Biris is Tahor, one may go out with it;</p>
<p class="bas indent2"><span class="nm">1.</span>A bracelet is Tamei (it is listed among Kelim taken from [the war with] Midyan!</p>
<p class="bas indent1"><span class="nm">(d)</span><span class="cl">Answer:</span> Rav Yehudah means, Biris corresponds to a bracelet (but it is worn on the leg to hold up socks).</p>
<p class="bas indent1"><span class="nm">(e)</span><span class="cl">(Ravin):</span> Biris is a single [leg bracelet], Kevalim are a pair.</p>
<p class="bas indent1"><span class="nm">(f)</span><span class="cl">(Rav Huna):</span> Both of these are pairs - one connects them by a chain to make them Kevalim. (R. Yirmeyah was dozing during this dialogue.)</p>
<p class="bas indent1"><span class="nm">(g)</span><span class="cl">Question:</span> Does the chain make them a Kli [to Mekabel Tum'ah]?!</p>
<p class="bas indent2"><span class="nm">1.</span><span class="cl">Suggestion:</span> Perhaps they are Mekabel Tum'ah on account of R. Shmuel's teaching (because they make noise)!</p>
<p class="bas indent2"><span class="nm">2.</span><span class="cl">Question (R. Shmuel bar Nachmani):</span> What is the source that a metal Kli that makes noise is Mekabel Tum'ah?</p>
<p class="bas indent2"><span class="nm">3.</span><span class="cl">Answer:</span> "Kol <i>Davar</i> Asher Yavo ba'Esh..." - even Dibur is included.</p>
<p class="bas indent1"><span class="nm">(h)</span><span class="cl">Rejection:</span> That is when the noise accomplishes something - here, it serves no purpose!</p>
<p class="bas indent1"><span class="nm">(i)</span><span class="cl">Answer:</span> Kevalim serve a purpose!</p>
<p class="bas indent2"><span class="nm">1.</span><span class="cl">(Rabah bar bar Chanah):</span> There was a family in Yerushalayim, the women used to take large steps, causing their Besulim to fall out. They made Kevalim for them to limit the size of their steps - this solved the problem.</p>
<p class="bas indent1"><span class="nm">(j)</span>R. Yirmeyah woke up and approved of this answer, for R. Yochanan also said so.</p>
<p class="bas subject"><span class="nm">6)</span>TUM'AH OF ARIG AND TACHSHITIM</p>
<p class="bas indent1"><span class="nm">(a)</span><span class="cl">(Rav Dimi citing R. Yochanan):</span> Arig (a woven garment) of any size is Tamei (Mekabel Tum'ah) - we learn from the Tzitz.</p>
<p class="bas indent1"><span class="nm">(b)</span><span class="cl">Objection: (Abaye):</span> The Tzitz was not woven!</p>
<p class="bas indent2"><span class="nm">1.</span><span class="cl">(Beraisa):</span> The Tzitz was a golden plate two fingers wide; it went [across the forehead] from ear to ear;</p>
<p class="bas indent2"><span class="nm">2.</span>'Kodesh la'Shem' was written on it in two lines - 'Hashem' was written on top [on the right], 'Kodesh' and the letter 'Lamed' were written on bottom [on the left. R. Tam, cited by Rishonim - 'Kodesh' and 'Lamed' were on top on the left, 'Hashem' was on bottom, on the left].</p>
<p class="bas indent2"><span class="nm">3.</span>R. Eliezer b'Rebbi Yosi says, I saw it in the treasure-house of Romi - 'Kodesh la'Shem' was written in one line. (Rambam - Chachamim agree that it is Kosher in one line; Me'iri - Chachamim did not accept R. Eliezer's testimony.)</p>
<p class="bas indent1"><span class="nm">(c)</span><span class="cl">(Rav Dimi):</span> I erred - rather, R. Yochanan taught that a Tachshit of any size is Tamei - we learn from the Tzitz;</p>
<p class="bas indent2"><span class="nm">1.</span>Arig of any size is Tamei - we learn from "O Beged".</p>
<p class="bas indent1"><span class="nm">(d)</span><span class="cl">(Beraisa):</span> Arig or a Tachshit of any size is Tamei;</p>
<p class="bas indent1"><span class="nm">(e)</span><span class="cl">Version #1 (Rashi):</span> Something half-Arig and half-Tachshit of any size is Tamei;</p>
<p class="bas indent1"><span class="nm">(f)</span><span class="cl">Version #2 (Tosfos ha'Rosh):</span> Arig or Tachshit to any degree (it is barely decorative) is Tamei; (end of Version #2)</p>
<p class="bas indent1"><span class="nm">(g)</span>Sak (sackcloth, made out of goat's hair) has an advantage over Beged (fabric) - it is Tamei on account of Arig (this will be explained).</p>
<p class="bas indent1"><span class="nm">(h)</span><span class="cl">(Rava):</span> Arig of any size is Tamei - we learn from "O Veged";</p>
<p class="bas indent2"><span class="nm">1.</span>A Tachshit of any size is Tamei - we learn from the Tzitz;</p>
<p class="bas indent2"><span class="nm">2.</span>Arig and Tachshit of any size is Tamei - we learn from "Kol Kli Ma'aseh".</p>
<p class="bas indent1"><span class="nm">(i)</span><span class="cl">Question (a Chacham):</span> The verse refers to Kelim taken from Midyan (Tosfos - it does not discuss Tum'ah at all)!</p>
<p class="bas indent1"><span class="nm">(j)</span><span class="cl">Answer (Rava):</span> Indeed, we learn about Tum'ah from a Gezerah Shavah "Kli-Kli".</p>
