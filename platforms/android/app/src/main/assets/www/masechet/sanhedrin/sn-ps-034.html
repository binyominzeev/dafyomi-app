<p class="bas subject"><span class="nm">1)</span>WHO CAN GIVE REASONS?</p>
<p class="bas indent1"><span class="nm">(a)</span><span class="cl">Question:</span> What is R. Yosi b'Rebbi Yehudah's reason?</p>
<p class="bas indent1"><span class="nm">(b)</span><span class="cl">Answer:</span> "V'Ed Echad Lo Ya'aneh v'Nefesh Lamus" - he does not speak to kill, but he speaks for Zechus.</p>
<p class="bas indent1"><span class="nm">(c)</span><span class="cl">Question:</span> What is Chachamim's reason?</p>
<p class="bas indent1"><span class="nm">(d)</span><span class="cl">Answer (Reish Lakish):</span> It looks like his testimony is biased (he wants to acquit Ploni).</p>
<p class="bas indent1"><span class="nm">(e)</span><span class="cl">Question:</span> What do Chachamim expound from "Lamus"?</p>
<p class="bas indent1"><span class="nm">(f)</span><span class="cl">Answer:</span> It refers to one of the Talmidim;</p>
<p class="bas indent2"><span class="nm">1.</span><span class="cl">(Beraisa):</span> If one of the witnesses has a reason (even) for Zechus, we do not listen - "v'Ed Echad Lo Ya'aneh." ("Lamus" does not apply to witnesses. Since it would look like they are Noge'a, they may not a witness for Zechus or Chiyuv);</p>
<p class="bas indent2"><span class="nm">2.</span>If one of the Talmidim has a reason for Chiyuv, we do not listen - "Echad Lo Ya'aneh v'Nefesh Lamus."</p>
<p class="bas subject"><span class="nm">2)</span>CHANGING ONE'S OPINION</p>
<p class="bas indent1"><span class="nm">(a)</span><span class="cl">(Mishnah):</span> In capital cases, one who gave a reason...</p>
<p class="bas indent1"><span class="nm">(b)</span><span class="cl">(Rav):</span> This is only at the time of debating. When they vote on the final verdict, one who gave a reason for Zechus can vote 'Chayav'.</p>
<p class="bas indent1"><span class="nm">(c)</span><span class="cl">Question (Mishnah):</span> The next day, they rise early. A Mezakeh says 'I was Mezakeh, and I still am.' A Mechayev says 'I was Mechayev, and I still am';</p>
<p class="bas indent2"><span class="nm">1.</span>One who gave a reason for Chiyuv can give a reason for Zechus, but one who gave a reason for Zechus cannot give a reason for Chiyuv.</p>
<p class="bas indent2"><span class="nm">2.</span>The next day is when they give the final verdict!</p>
<p class="bas indent1"><span class="nm">(d)</span><span class="cl">Answer:</span> They also debate the next day. One cannot change from Zechus to Chiyuv at the time of debate.</p>
<p class="bas indent1"><span class="nm">(e)</span><span class="cl">Question (Mishnah):</span> They debate with each other until one of the Mechayvim agrees with the Mezakim.</p>
<p class="bas indent2"><span class="nm">1.</span>According to Rav, it should say 'or until one of the Mezakim agrees with the Mechayvim'!</p>
<p class="bas indent1"><span class="nm">(f)</span><span class="cl">Answer:</span> Indeed, that is true. The Tana prefers to teach only the case in which the final verdict is Zechus.</p>
<p class="bas indent1"><span class="nm">(g)</span><span class="cl">Question:</span> R. Yosi bar Chanina taught that if one of the Talmidim was Mezakeh and he died, we count him as if he is still Mezakeh.</p>
<p class="bas indent2"><span class="nm">1.</span>We should be concerned lest he would have retracted to Mechayev!</p>
<p class="bas indent1"><span class="nm">(h)</span><span class="cl">Answer:</span> Since he did not retract in his life, we are not concerned for this.</p>
<p class="bas indent1"><span class="nm">(i)</span><span class="cl">Question:</span> They sent from Eretz Yisrael that R. Yosi bar Chanina argues with Rav!</p>
<p class="bas indent1"><span class="nm">(j)</span><span class="cl">Answer:</span> No, they said that he does not argue with Rav.</p>
<p class="bas indent1"><span class="nm">(k)</span><span class="cl">Question (Mishnah):</span> One scribe stands to the right of the judges and writes the words of the Mezakim, and one scribe stands to the left and writes the words of the Mechayvim.</p>
<p class="bas indent2"><span class="nm">1.</span>Granted, we must write the words of the Mechayvim, lest a Mechayev be Mechayev for a different reason the next day, requiring Halanas Din (to postpone the verdict another day, to give to him time to reconsider the new reason).</p>
<p class="bas indent2"><span class="nm">2.</span>However,  why must we write the words of the Mezakim? (We do not need Halanas Din for a new reason for Zechus!)</p>
<p class="bas indent2"><span class="nm">3.</span><span class="cl">Suggestion:</span> We must say that a judge cannot change from Zechus to Chiyuv (unless he originally erred in something the Tzedukim admit to. Therefore, we write his words, lest tomorrow he will think to Mechayev, and will assume that he formerly erred in something the Tzedukim admit to)!</p>
<p class="bas indent1"><span class="nm">(l)</span><span class="cl">Answer:</span> No, we write the words of the Mezakim lest two judges give the same reason due to different verses (as we now explain)</p>
<p class="bas indent2"><span class="nm">1.</span><span class="cl">Question (Rav Asi):</span> If two judges give the same reason due to different verses, what is the law?</p>
<p class="bas indent2"><span class="nm">2.</span><span class="cl">Answer (R. Yochanan):</span> They count only like one (because one of them is erring).</p>
<p class="bas indent1"><span class="nm">(m)</span><span class="cl">Question:</span> What is the source of this?</p>
<p class="bas indent1"><span class="nm">(n)</span><span class="cl">Answer (Abaye):</span> "Achas Diber Elokim Shtayim Zu Shamati"- one verse has many meanings, but one law is not learned from more than one verse.</p>
<p class="bas indent1"><span class="nm">(o)</span><span class="cl">(Tana d'Vei R. Yishmael):</span> "Uch'Patish Yefotzetz Sela" - just like a hammer is broken by (R. Tam; Rashbam - breaks) a rock into many pieces, one verse has many meanings.</p>
<p class="bas subject"><span class="nm">3)</span>ONE LAW LEARNED FROM TWO VERSES</p>
<p class="bas indent1"><span class="nm">(a)</span><span class="cl">Question:</span> What is a case of a law learned from more than one verse (which indicates that one of the opinions is wrong)?</p>
<p class="bas indent1"><span class="nm">(b)</span><span class="cl">Answer (Rav Zvid - Mishnah):</span> The Mizbe'ach is Mekadesh what is proper for it (as we now explain);</p>
<p class="bas indent2"><span class="nm">1.</span>R. Yehoshua says, anything proper to be burned on the Mizbe'ach, once it is brought up the ramp, we do not take it down (even if it was Pasul and should not have been brought up) - "ha'Olah Al Mokedah";</p>
<p class="bas indent3"><span class="nm">i.</span>Just like an Olah is proper to be burned on the Mizbe'ach, and if it was brought up, we do not take it down, the same applies to everything proper to be burned on the Mizbe'ach.</p>
<p class="bas indent2"><span class="nm">2.</span>Raban Gamliel says, anything proper for the Mizbe'ach, once it is brought up, we do not take it down - "Hi ha'Olah Al Mokedah Al ha'Mizbe'ach";</p>
<p class="bas indent3"><span class="nm">i.</span>Just like an Olah is proper for the Mizbe'ach, if it is brought up, we do not take it down, also everything proper for the Mizbe'ach.</p>
<p class="bas indent2"><span class="nm">3.</span>Both Tana'im include Korbanos that became Pasul in the Mikdash. R. Yehoshua learns from "Mokedah", and Raban Gamliel learns from "Mizbe'ach."</p>
<p class="bas indent1"><span class="nm">(c)</span><span class="cl">Rejection:</span> They argue in Halachah (not just how to expound)!</p>
<p class="bas indent2"><span class="nm">1.</span><span class="cl">(Seifa):</span> They argue only about the blood and the Nesachim.Raban Gamliel says that they do not go down (for they go on the Mizbe'ach). R. Yehoshua says that they go down (for they are not burned).</p>
<p class="bas indent1"><span class="nm">(d)</span>Answer #2 (Rav Papa - Beraisa - R. Yosi ha'Galili) Suggestion: Perhaps "Kol ha'Noge'a ba'Mizbe'ach Yikdash" applies whether or not it isf Kosher (for the Mizbe'ach)!</p>
<p class="bas bbbline">34b----------------------------------------34b</p>
<p class="bas indent2"><span class="nm">1.</span><span class="cl">Rejection:</span> "Kevasim" - just like lambs are Kosher, also anything Kosher (does not go down).</p>
<p class="bas indent2"><span class="nm">2.</span>R. Akiva says, "Olah" teaches that just like an Olah is Kosher, also everything that is Kosher (does not go down).</p>
<p class="bas indent2"><span class="nm">3.</span>Both Tana'im exclude Pesulim that were never Kosher. R. Yosi ha'Galili learns from "Kevasim", and R. Akiva learns from "Olah"!</p>
<p class="bas indent1"><span class="nm">(e)</span><span class="cl">Rejection:</span> Rav Ada bar Ahavah taught that they argue about a Pasul Olas ha'Of. We do not learn this from "Kevasim", but it is included in "Olah".</p>
<p class="bas indent1"><span class="nm">(f)</span><span class="cl">Answer #3 (Rav Ashi - Beraisa - R. Yishmael):</span> "Dam Yechashev... Dam Shofach" includes one who throws the blood (of a Korban outside the Mikdash. He is Chayav Kares, just like one who slaughters);</p>
<p class="bas indent2"><span class="nm">1.</span>R. Akiva says, "Oh Zavach" includes one who throws.</p>
<p class="bas indent2"><span class="nm">2.</span>Both include one who throws. R. Yishmael learns from "Dam Yechashev", and R. Akiva learns from "Oh Zavach."</p>
<p class="bas indent1"><span class="nm">(g)</span><span class="cl">Objection:</span> R. Avahu taught that they argue about one who slaughtered and threw. R. Yishmael obligates only one Korban (if he was Shogeg, because throwing was learned from the same Kares as slaughtering), and R. Akiva obligates two Korbanos (we learned throwing from a different Kares written about offering outside the Mikdash).</p>
<p class="bas indent1"><span class="nm">(h)</span><span class="cl">Defense (of Rav Ashi - Abaye):</span> No, R. Akiva admits that he is liable only once because the same Lav forbids both - "Sham Ta'aleh Olasecha v'Sham Ta'aseh..."</p>
<p class="bas subject"><span class="nm">4)</span>MAY WE JUDGE AT NIGHT?</p>
<p class="bas indent1"><span class="nm">(a)</span><span class="cl">(Mishnah):</span> Monetary cases must be started during the day...</p>
<p class="bas indent1"><span class="nm">(b)</span><span class="cl">Question:</span> What is the source (that they can finish at night)?</p>
<p class="bas indent1"><span class="nm">(c)</span><span class="cl">Answer (R. Chiya bar Papa):</span> "V'Shoftu Es ha'Am b'Chol Es."</p>
<p class="bas indent1"><span class="nm">(d)</span><span class="cl">Question:</span> If so, it should be permitted to start at night!</p>
<p class="bas indent1"><span class="nm">(e)</span><span class="cl">Answer:</span> Rava teaches that this is not so.</p>
<p class="bas indent2"><span class="nm">1.</span><span class="cl">Contradiction (Rava):</span> It says "v'Shoftu Es ha'Am b'Chol Es", and it says "b'Yom Hanchilo Es Banav"!</p>
<p class="bas indent2"><span class="nm">2.</span><span class="cl">Answer (Rava):</span> The case must be started during the day. It can finish at night.</p>
<p class="bas indent1"><span class="nm">(f)</span>Our Mishnah is not like R. Meir.</p>
<p class="bas indent2"><span class="nm">1.</span><span class="cl">(Beraisa - R. Meir) Question:</span> "V'Al Pihem Yihyeh Kol Riv v'Chol Naga" - what is the connection between Riv (Dinim) and Naga (Tzara'as)?</p>
<p class="bas indent2"><span class="nm">2.</span><span class="cl">Answer (R. Meir):</span> The Torah equates them. Just like the Kohen looks at Tzara'as only during the day ("uv'Yom Hera'os"), also Dinim must be judged during the day.</p>
<p class="bas indent3"><span class="nm">i.</span>Also, just like a blind Kohen cannot rule about Tzara'as ("l'Chol Mar'e Einei ha'Kohen"), a blind person cannot judge Dinim.</p>
<p class="bas indent2"><span class="nm">3.</span>We also learn from Dinim to Tzara'as. Just like relatives cannot judge Dinim, they cannot rule about Tzara'as.</p>
<p class="bas indent2"><span class="nm">4.</span><span class="cl">Suggestion:</span> Just like three judges are required for Dinim, we should require three Kohanim to rule about Tzara'as!</p>
<p class="bas indent3"><span class="nm">i.</span><span class="cl">Support:</span> If three judges are required to take money from a person, and all the more so three are required to declare Tzara'as on his body!</p>
<p class="bas indent2"><span class="nm">5.</span><span class="cl">Rejection:</span> "V'Huva El Aharon ha'Kohen Oh El Echad" - even one Kohen can rule.</p>
<p class="bas indent1"><span class="nm">(g)</span>A blind man used to judge in R. Yochanan's neighborhood. R. Yochanan did not say anything.</p>
<p class="bas indent1"><span class="nm">(h)</span><span class="cl">Question:</span> R. Yochanan said that the Halachah follows a Stam Mishnah!</p>
<p class="bas indent2"><span class="nm">1.</span><span class="cl">(Mishnah):</span> Anyone Kosher to judge is Kosher to testify. There is someone Kosher to testify who is disqualified from judging.</p>
<p class="bas indent2"><span class="nm">2.</span><span class="cl">(R. Yochanan):</span> Someone blind in one eye is Kosher to testify but disqualified from judging.</p>
<p class="bas indent1"><span class="nm">(i)</span><span class="cl">Answer:</span> R. Yochanan rules like a different Stam Mishnah (i.e. ours).</p>
<p class="bas indent2"><span class="nm">1.</span><span class="cl">(Mishnah):</span> Monetary cases must be started during the day, but they can finish at night (when people are like blind people, they cannot see).</p>
<p class="bas indent1"><span class="nm">(j)</span><span class="cl">Question:</span> Why does he rule like our Stam Mishnah, and not like the other?</p>
<p class="bas indent1"><span class="nm">(k)</span><span class="cl">Answer #1:</span> Our Mishnah is the opinion of many Chachamim (since it is never attributed to an individual, but the other Mishnah is like R. Meir (in the Beraisa above).</p>
<p class="bas indent1"><span class="nm">(l)</span><span class="cl">Answer #2:</span> Our Mishnah teaches the law among other laws of Dinim.</p>
<p class="bas indent1"><span class="nm">(m)</span><span class="cl">Question:</span> How does R. Meir expound "v'Shoftu Es ha'Am b'Chol Es"?</p>
<p class="bas indent1"><span class="nm">(n)</span><span class="cl">Answer (Rava):</span> It permits judging on a cloudy day. (We would have thought that we cannot, for we cannot see Tzara'as then.)</p>
<p class="bas indent2"><span class="nm">1.</span><span class="cl">(Mishnah):</span> We do not look at Tzara'as early in the morning or late in the afternoon (when the sun is weak), in a house, or on a cloudy day, for then a faint appearance will look strong;</p>
<p class="bas indent2"><span class="nm">2.</span>We do not look at midday, for then a strong appearance will look weak.</p>
<p class="bas indent1"><span class="nm">(o)</span><span class="cl">Question:</span> How does R. Meir expound "b'Yom Hanchilo"?</p>
<p class="bas indent1"><span class="nm">(p)</span><span class="cl">Answer:</span> He learns like Rabah bar Chinena;</p>
<p class="bas indent2"><span class="nm">1.</span><span class="cl">(Rabah bar Chinena):</span> "B'Yom Hanchilo Es Banav" - we bequeath by day, and not at night.</p>
<p class="bas indent2"><span class="nm">2.</span><span class="cl">Objection (Rav Nachman):</span> If someone dies at night, do his children not inherit him?!</p>
<p class="bas indent2"><span class="nm">3.</span><span class="cl">Suggestion (Rav Nachman):</span> Perhaps your mean that we do not judge cases of inheritance at night.</p>
<p class="bas indent3"><span class="nm">i.</span><span class="cl">(Beraisa):</span> "L'Chukas Mishpat" - the end of the Parshah (of inheritance) is called Din.</p>
<p class="bas indent3"><span class="nm">ii.</span><span class="cl">(Rav Yehudah):</span> If three people went to visit a sick person (and he commanded how to bequeath his property, and then died), they may write his command, or they may execute it;</p>
<p class="bas indent3"><span class="nm">iii.</span>If only two were present, they must write it, but they may not execute it (they are not a Beis Din).</p>
<p class="bas indent3"><span class="nm">iv.</span><span class="cl">(Rav Chisda):</span> This is if they visited during the day. If they visited at night, they must write it, but they may not execute it, for they are witnesses, and they cannot become judges (even during the day).</p>
<p class="bas indent2"><span class="nm">4.</span><span class="cl">Rabah bar Chinena:</span> Yes, that is what I meant.</p>
