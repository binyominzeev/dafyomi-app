<p class="bas subject"><span class="nm">1)</span><i>KITNIYOS </i>(cont.)</p>
<p class="bas indent1"><span class="nm">(a)</span>We need all three statements of Shmuel:</p>
<p class="bas indent2"><span class="nm">1.</span>From "the halachah follows R. Shimon Shezuri" we would think that he holds of Bilah;</p>
<p class="bas indent2"><span class="nm">2.</span>From "there is no Bilah" alone we would think that he holds there to be no solution for this mixture of Kitniyos;</p>
<p class="bas indent2"><span class="nm">3.</span>From these two statements alone there seems to be a contradiction in Shmuel, so we also need his statement that he follows the end of the growth process;</p>
<p class="bas indent2"><span class="nm">4.</span>From "we follow the end of the growth process" alone we would think that this is also true for crops and olives, so we need his statement that he follows R. Shimon Shezuri i.e. only with Kitniyos.</p>
<p class="bas indent1"><span class="nm">(b)</span><span class="cl">Question:</span> Why do we need his statement that "there is no Bilah"?</p>
<p class="bas indent1"><span class="nm">(c)</span><span class="cl">Answer:</span> As the end of that statement tells us that there is Bilah for wine and oil.</p>
<p class="bas subject"><span class="nm">2)</span>CROPS VERSUS VEGETABLES</p>
<p class="bas indent1"><span class="nm">(a)</span><span class="cl">(Beraisa):</span> A Pasuk teaches us that Ma'aser follows the ingathering of grain and wine:</p>
<p class="bas indent2"><span class="nm">1.</span><span class="cl">(R. Yosi haGelili):</span> Just as grain and wine grow from the previous year's rain and have Ma'aser taken according to the previous year, so too for everything that grows from the previous year's rain.</p>
<p class="bas indent3"><span class="nm">i.</span>This excludes vegetables, which grow from the present year's rains, and have Ma'aser taken according to this year.</p>
<p class="bas indent2"><span class="nm">2.</span><span class="cl">(R. Akiva):</span> Just as grain and wine grow from rainwater and have Ma'aser taken according to the previous year, so too for everything that grows from rainwater.</p>
<p class="bas indent3"><span class="nm">i.</span>This excludes vegetables, which are also artificially irrigated, and have Ma'aser taken according to this year.</p>
<p class="bas indent1"><span class="nm">(b)</span><span class="cl">Question:</span> What is the difference between these opinions?</p>
<p class="bas indent1"><span class="nm">(c)</span><span class="cl">Answer (R. Avahu):</span> In a case where they are artificially irrigated, yet grow from the previous year's rains, as follows:</p>
<p class="bas indent2"><span class="nm">1.</span><span class="cl">(Mishnah):</span> Eunuch-onions and Egyptian beans which are sown as vegetables:</p>
<p class="bas indent2"><span class="nm">2.</span>If water was withheld from them for thirty days before Rosh Hashanah, they have Ma'aser taken according to the previous year, and if the current year is Shemitah, they are permitted. (R. Akiva would disagree with this.)</p>
<p class="bas indent2"><span class="nm">3.</span>Otherwise, they are forbidden if the year is Shemitah, and Ma'aser is taken according to this year.</p>
<p class="bas subject"><span class="nm">3)</span>THE NEW YEAR FOR TREES</p>
<p class="bas indent1"><span class="nm">(a)</span><span class="cl">Question:</span> Why is Shevat the new year for trees?</p>
<p class="bas indent1"><span class="nm">(b)</span><span class="cl">Answer (R. Elazar citing R. Oshiya):</span> Most of the rains have passed (and new growth begins), and most of the season is yet to come.</p>
<p class="bas indent2"><span class="nm">1.</span><span class="cl">Question:</span> Surely if most of the season is yet to come then it shouldn't be the new year yet!</p>
<p class="bas indent2"><span class="nm">2.</span><span class="cl">Answer:</span> It should be read as "even though most of the season is yet to come."</p>
<p class="bas indent1"><span class="nm">(c)</span><span class="cl">(Beraisa):</span> R. Akiva once harvested an Esrog on the 1st of Shevat and took Ma'aser of two years (Ma'aser Sheni of the second year and Ma'aser Ani of the third).</p>
<p class="bas indent2"><span class="nm">1.</span><span class="cl">(Tana Kama):</span> This was because he followed both Beis Shamai (who hold that the 1st is the new year) and Beis Hillel (who follow the 15th).</p>
<p class="bas bbbline">14b----------------------------------------14b</p>
<p class="bas indent2"><span class="nm">2.</span><span class="cl">(R. Yosi bar Yehudah):</span> It was because he was following both R. Gamliel and R. Eliezer:</p>
<p class="bas indent3"><span class="nm">i.</span><span class="cl">(R. Gamliel):</span> An Esrog follows its sprouting, like a tree, for Orlah, Revai, and Shevi'is; it follows its harvesting, like a vegetable, for Ma'aser.</p>
<p class="bas indent3"><span class="nm">ii.</span><span class="cl">(R. Eliezer):</span> An Esrog is like a tree for everything.</p>
<p class="bas indent1"><span class="nm">(d)</span><span class="cl">Question:</span> How is it permitted to follow the stringencies of both opinions?</p>
<p class="bas indent2"><span class="nm">1.</span>The halachah is ruled to always follow Beis Hillel.</p>
<p class="bas indent2"><span class="nm">2.</span><span class="cl">(Previously):</span> One may consistently follow either Beis Shamai or Beis Hillel.</p>
<p class="bas indent2"><span class="nm">3.</span>Someone who follows the leniencies of both is wicked.</p>
<p class="bas indent2"><span class="nm">4.</span>Someone who follows the stringencies of both is a fool.</p>
<p class="bas indent1"><span class="nm">(e)</span><span class="cl">Answer:</span> R. Akiva wanted to follow Beis Hillel, but he didn't know if Beis Hillel followed the 1st or 15th.</p>
<p class="bas indent1"><span class="nm">(f)</span><span class="cl">Question:</span> R. Yosi bar Yehudah is following Beis Shamai (as according to Beis Hillel, the sprouting and harvesting are in the same year)!?</p>
<p class="bas indent1"><span class="nm">(g)</span><span class="cl">Answer (R. Chanina or R. Chananyah):</span> In this case the Esrog had sprouted before the 15th of the previous Shevat (and so according to Beis Hillel, the sprouting and harvesting are in different years).</p>
<p class="bas indent2"><span class="nm">1.</span>The same would be true even if it was harvested before the 1st of Shevat; the story simply happened this way.</p>
<p class="bas indent1"><span class="nm">(h)</span><span class="cl">Alternate answer (Ravina):</span> Emend R. Yosi to argue with the Tana Kama on two things:</p>
<p class="bas indent2"><span class="nm">1.</span>It happened on the 15th of Shevat, not the 1st.</p>
<p class="bas indent2"><span class="nm">2.</span>It was because he was following both R. Gamliel and R. Eliezer, not Beis Shamai and Beis Hillel.</p>
<p class="bas subject"><span class="nm">4)</span>THE NEW YEAR FOR ESROGIM</p>
<p class="bas indent1"><span class="nm">(a)</span><span class="cl">(Rabah bar R. Huna):</span> Since R. Gamliel ruled that Esrog follows its harvesting for Ma'aser (like vegetables), its new year begins in Tishrei.</p>
<p class="bas indent1"><span class="nm">(b)</span><span class="cl">Question:</span> We see differently:</p>
<p class="bas indent2"><span class="nm">1.</span><span class="cl">(Tosefta):</span> If one harvested Esrogim both before and after sundown on the eve of the 15th of Shevat, Terumah and Ma'aser may not be taken from one lot to exempt the other.</p>
<p class="bas indent2"><span class="nm">2.</span>If it was the third year entering the fourth, that of the third requires Ma'aser Rishon and Ani while that of the fourth requires Ma'aser Rishon and Sheni.</p>
<p class="bas indent2"><span class="nm">3.</span>It is R. Gamliel who follows harvesting, and we see that the new year begins in Shevat!?</p>
