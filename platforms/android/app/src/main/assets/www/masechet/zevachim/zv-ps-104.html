<div class="indent1"><span class="nm">(a)</span><p><span class="cl">Question:</span> What is the argument of Rebbi and R. Elazar?</p></div>
<div class="indent1"><span class="nm">(b)</span><p><span class="cl">Answer (Beraisa - Rebbi):</span> Blood is Meratzeh for flayed skin;</p></div>
<div class="indent2"><span class="nm">1.</span><p>When skin is attached to the meat, whether a Pesul occurred before or after Zerikah, the same law applies to the skin and the meat.</p></div>
<div class="indent2"><span class="nm">2.</span><p>R. Elazar b'Rebbi Shimon says, blood is not Meratzeh for flayed skin;</p></div>
<div class="indent2"><span class="nm">3.</span><p>When it is attached to the meat, if a Pesul occurred before Zerikah, the same law applies to the skin and the meat;</p></div>
<div class="indent3"><span class="nm">i.</span><p>If a Pesul occurred after Zerikah, since the meat was once permitted, Kohanim receive the skin.</p></div>
<div class="indent1"><span class="nm">(c)</span><p><span class="cl">Suggestion:</span> These Tana'im argue like R. Eliezer and R. Yehoshua:</p></div>
<div class="indent2"><span class="nm">1.</span><p><span class="cl">(Beraisa - R. Yehoshua):</span> "V'Asisa Olosecha <i>ha'Basar veha'Dam</i>" - both Zerikas Dam and Haktarah of the meat must be done. One cannot be done without the other (e.g. if one of them became lost or Pasul);</p></div>
<div class="indent2"><span class="nm">2.</span><p>R. Eliezer says, Zerikah can be done even without Haktarah of the meat - "v'Dam Zevachecha Yishpoch".</p></div>
<div class="indent2"><span class="nm">3.</span><p><span class="cl">Question:</span> What does he learn from "V'Asisa Olosecha ha'Basar veha'Dam"?</p></div>
<div class="indent2"><span class="nm">4.</span><p><span class="cl">Answer:</span> Just like blood is thrown, also meat. This teaches that there was a gap between the ramp and the Mizbe'ach.</p></div>
<div class="indent2"><span class="nm">5.</span><p><span class="cl">Suggestion:</span> Rebbi holds like R. Eliezer (Zerikah is Meratzeh even without meat, it permits skin), and R. Elazar b'Rebbi Shimon holds like R. Yehoshua (Zerikah is only for the sake of meat).</p></div>
<div class="indent1"><span class="nm">(d)</span><p><span class="cl">Rejection:</span> Granted, we cannot say that R. Elazar holds like R. Eliezer, he must hold like R. Yehoshua;</p></div>
<div class="indent2"><span class="nm">1.</span><p>However, Rebbi could hold like R. Eliezer, or even like R. Yehoshua!</p></div>
<div class="indent2"><span class="nm">2.</span><p><span class="cl">Version #1 (Rashi):</span> R. Yehoshua expounded that Zerikah must permit meat. He was not more stringent than the Torah to cause a loss to Kohanim;</p></div>
<div class="indent3"><span class="nm">i.</span><p>If Zerikah was done (improperly, when it will not permit meat), he admits that Kohanim receive the skin, just like he admits that the owner was Yotzei!</p></div>
<div class="indent2"><span class="nm">3.</span><p><span class="cl">Version #2 (Tosfos):</span> R. Yehoshua decreed not to do Zerikah when the meat became Pasul, due to when it was lost. This decree causes a loss to the owner, but not to Kohanim;</p></div>
<div class="indent3"><span class="nm">i.</span><p>If Zerikah was done (improperly), he does not decree that Kohanim not receive the skin, just like he does not decree that the owner was not Yotzei! (End of Version #2)</p></div>
<div class="indent3"><span class="nm">ii.</span><p><span class="cl">(Mishnah - R. Eliezer):</span> If the meat became Tamei or Pasul, or left the Azarah, we throw the blood;</p></div>
<div class="indent3"><span class="nm">iii.</span><p>R. Yehoshua says, we do not throw it;</p></div>
<div class="indent3"><span class="nm">iv.</span><p>R. Yehoshua admits that if Zerikah was done, the owner was Yotzei.</p></div>
<div class="subject"><span class="nm">2)</span><p>THE SKIN OF A <i>KORBAN PASUL</i></p></div>
<div class="indent1"><span class="nm">(a)</span><p><span class="cl">(Mishnah - R. Chanina Segan ha'Kohanim):</span> (I never saw a skin taken to Beis ha'Sereifah.)</p></div>
<div class="indent1"><span class="nm">(b)</span><p><span class="cl">Question:</span> Surely, he saw Parim ha'Nisrafim and Se'irim ha'Nisrafim (e.g. of Yom Kipur!)</p></div>
<div class="indent1"><span class="nm">(c)</span><p><span class="cl">Answer:</span> He means that he never saw a skin taken to Beis ha'Sereifah due to a Pesul.</p></div>
<div class="indent1"><span class="nm">(d)</span><p><span class="cl">Question:</span> Whenever a Pesul occurs before flaying and before Zerikah, all agree that the skin is burned! (Surely, many thousands (if not, not millions) of Korbanos were slaughtered in R. Chanina's presence, and some were found to be Treifah!)</p></div>
<div class="indent1"><span class="nm">(e)</span><p><span class="cl">Answer:</span> He means that he never saw a <i>flayed</i> skin taken to Beis ha'Sereifah.</p></div>
<div class="indent1"><span class="nm">(f)</span><p><span class="cl">Question:</span> According to R. Elazar b'Rebbi Shimon, if a Pesul occurred after flaying and before Zerikah, the skin is burned!</p></div>
<div class="indent1"><span class="nm">(g)</span><p><span class="cl">Answer #1:</span> R. Chanina holds like Rebbi.</p></div>
<div class="indent1"><span class="nm">(h)</span><p><span class="cl">Answer #2:</span> He can even hold like R. Elazar. All agree that l'Chatchilah, we do not flay before Zerikah.</p></div>
<div class="indent1"><span class="nm">(i)</span><p><span class="cl">Question:</span> If a Korban was found to be Treifah in the intestines, surely it was Pasul before flaying and before Zerikah!</p></div>
<div class="indent1"><span class="nm">(j)</span><p><span class="cl">Answer:</span> He holds that in such a case, since the Pesul was not known before Zerikah, it is Meratzeh (so Kohanim receive the skin).</p></div>
<div class="indent1"><span class="nm">(k)</span><p><span class="cl">Support (Mishnah - R. Akiva):</span> From R. Chanina we learn that (even) if a Bechor was found to be Treifah after flaying, Kohanim receive the skin.</p></div>
<div class="indent1"><span class="nm">(l)</span><p><span class="cl">Question:</span> R. Chanina says so about all Kodshim. Why did R. Akiva specify Bechor?</p></div>
<div class="indent1"><span class="nm">(m)</span><p><span class="cl">Answer:</span> He teaches that the same applies to a Bechor Ba'al Mum slaughtered and flayed outside the Mikdash. (Even though the meat must be burned, the Kohen keeps the skin. The law is like a Treifah found in the Mikdash after Zerikah and flaying.)</p></div>
<div class="indent1"><span class="nm">(n)</span><p><span class="cl">(R. Chiya bar Aba):</span> The Halachah follows R. Akiva.</p></div>
<div class="indent1"><span class="nm">(o)</span><p>Even R. Akiva discusses only when a Mumcheh (expert) saw the Mum and permitted slaughtering it. If not, the skin is burned.</p></div>
<div class="indent1"><span class="nm">(p)</span><p>The Halachah is like Chachamim (the meat is buried and the skin is burned. Rashi deletes this from the text, but Tosfos and the Rambam do not.)</p></div>
<div class="subject"><span class="nm">3)</span><p>BURNING THE <i>PARIM</i> AND <i>SE'IRIM HA'NISRAFIM</i></p></div>
<div class="indent1"><span class="nm">(a)</span><p><span class="cl">(Mishnah):</span> When Parim and Se'irim ha'Nisrafim are burned properly, they are burned in Beis ha'Deshen (outside of all three Machanos), and they are Metamei the clothes of those engaged in burning them;</p></div>
<div class="indent1"><span class="nm">(b)</span><p>When they are burned due to a Pesul, they are burned in Beis ha'Birah (this will be explained), and they are not Metamei Begadim (cause those engaged in them and the clothes they are wearing at the time to become Teme'im.)</p></div>
<div class="bbbline">104b----------------------------------------104b</p></div>
<div class="indent1"><span class="nm">(c)</span><p>If the animal was being carried out on poles, when the people in front have left the Azarah but not the people in back, those in front are Metamei Begadim, but those in back are not Metamei Begadim until they themselves leave;</p></div>
<div class="indent1"><span class="nm">(d)</span><p>When all have left, all are Metamei Begadim.</p></div>
<div class="indent1"><span class="nm">(e)</span><p>R. Shimon says, they are not Metamei Begadim until the majority of the animal catches fire.</p></div>
<div class="indent1"><span class="nm">(f)</span><p>Those engaged in burning after the meat melted are not Metamei Begadim. (Bartenura, Rambam - this clause is also R. Shimon, but Chachamim argue (106a).)</p></div>
<div class="indent1"><span class="nm">(g)</span><p><span class="cl">(Gemara) Question:</span> What is Beis ha'Birah?</p></div>
<div class="indent1"><span class="nm">(h)</span><p><span class="cl">Answer #1 (Rabah bar bar Chanah):</span> It is a place in Har ha'Bayis called 'Birah' (building).</p></div>
<div class="indent1"><span class="nm">(i)</span><p><span class="cl">Answer #2 (Reish Lakish):</span> All of Har ha'Bayis is called Birah - "ha'Birah Asher Hachinosi".</p></div>
<div class="indent1"><span class="nm">(j)</span><p><span class="cl">(Rav Nachman):</span> There are three Batei ha'Deshen:</p></div>
<div class="indent2"><span class="nm">1.</span><p>There is a big Beis ha'Deshen in the Azarah, to burn Pasul Kodshei Kodoshim and Eimurim of Kodshim Kalim, and Parim and Se'irim ha'Nisrafim that became Pasul before Zerikah;</p></div>
<div class="indent2"><span class="nm">2.</span><p>Another is in Har ha'Bayis, for Parim and Se'irim ha'Nisrafim that became Pasul after Zerikah;</p></div>
<div class="indent2"><span class="nm">3.</span><p>The third is outside all three Machanos. L'Chatchilah, Parim and Se'irim ha'Nisrafim are burned there.</p></div>

<div class="indent1"><span class="nm">(a)</span><p><span class="cl">Question (R. Yirmeyah):</span> Does Linah disqualify Parim and Se'irim ha'Nisrafim?</p></div>
<div class="indent2"><span class="nm">1.</span><p>Perhaps Linah applies only to meat that is consumed (by people or the Mizbe'ach), but these are burned outside;</p></div>
<div class="indent2"><span class="nm">2.</span><p>Or, perhaps this makes no difference!</p></div>
<div class="indent1"><span class="nm">(b)</span><p><span class="cl">Answer #1 (Rava):</span> Abaye asked this, and I answered from the following:</p></div>
<div class="indent2"><span class="nm">1.</span><p><span class="cl">(Beraisa):</span> (R. Shimon and Chachamim argue about one who was Mefagel in the Eimurim of Parim ha'Nisrafim, but) both agree that if one was Mefagel in the meat, this does not take effect (because the meat is not eaten).</p></div>
<div class="indent2"><span class="nm">2.</span><p><span class="cl">Suggestion:</span> Just like intent does not take effect on the meat, also Linah.</p></div>
<div class="indent1"><span class="nm">(c)</span><p><span class="cl">Rejection:</span> No, perhaps intent does not take effect, but Linah does.</p></div>
<div class="indent1"><span class="nm">(d)</span><p><span class="cl">Answer #2 (Beraisa):</span> Me'ilah applies to Parim and Se'irim ha'Nisrafim from the time they are made Hekdesh;</p></div>
<div class="indent2"><span class="nm">1.</span><p>After Shechitah, they have full Kedushas Mizbe'ach. If a Tevul Yom or Mechusar Kipurim touches them, they become Teme'im. Linah disqualifies them.</p></div>
<div class="indent2"><span class="nm">2.</span><p><span class="cl">Suggestion:</span> Linah of the meat disqualifies them!</p></div>
<div class="indent1"><span class="nm">(e)</span><p><span class="cl">Rejection:</span> No, the Beraisa discusses Linah of the Eimurim.</p></div>
<div class="indent2"><span class="nm">1.</span><p><span class="cl">Question (Seifa):</span> Me'ilah applies to them even in Beis ha'Deshen, until the meat is melted.</p></div>
<div class="indent3"><span class="nm">i.</span><p>Since the Seifa discusses the meat, also the Reisha!</p></div>
<div class="indent2"><span class="nm">2.</span><p><span class="cl">Answer:</span> No, the Seifa discusses the meat, but the Reisha discusses the Eimurim.</p></div>
<div class="indent1"><span class="nm">(f)</span><p><span class="cl">Answer #3:</span> Levi taught that one Beis ha'Deshen is in Har ha'Bayis for Parim and Se'irim ha'Nisrafim that became Pasul while being taken out.</p></div>
<div class="indent2"><span class="nm">1.</span><p><span class="cl">Suggestion:</span> They became Pasul through Linah!</p></div>
<div class="indent1"><span class="nm">(g)</span><p><span class="cl">Rejection:</span> No, they became Pasul through Tum'ah or Yetzi'ah (leaving the Azarah before Zerikah).</p></div>
<div class="indent1"><span class="nm">(h)</span><p><span class="cl">Question (R. Elazar):</span> Does Yetzi'ah (before Zerikah) disqualify Parim and Se'irim ha'Nisrafim?</p></div>
<div class="indent2"><span class="nm">1.</span><p><span class="cl">Question:</span> What is his question? (They must leave the Azarah. This is not a Pesul!)</p></div>
<div class="indent2"><span class="nm">2.</span><p><span class="cl">Answer (R. Yirmeyah bar Aba):</span> He asks according to Reish Lakish, who disqualifies Yotzei (meat of Kodshim Kalim that left the Azarah before Zerikah), even though it will be permitted to take the meat out later;</p></div>
<div class="indent3"><span class="nm">i.</span><p>Perhaps Reish Lakish disqualifies there, for there is never an obligation to take it out, but he would Machshir here, for (later) the Parim must be taken out;</p></div>
<div class="indent3"><span class="nm">ii.</span><p>Or, perhaps he disqualifies whenever something leaves prematurely.</p></div>
<div class="indent1"><span class="nm">(i)</span><p><span class="cl">Answer:</span> Levi taught that one Beis ha'Deshen is in Har ha'Bayis for Parim and Se'irim ha'Nisrafim that became Pasul while being taken out.</p></div>
<div class="indent2"><span class="nm">1.</span><p><span class="cl">Suggestion:</span> They became Pasul through Yetzi'ah!</p></div>
<div class="indent1"><span class="nm">(j)</span><p><span class="cl">Rejection:</span> No, they became Pasul through Tum'ah or Linah.</p></div>
<div class="indent1"><span class="nm">(k)</span><p><span class="cl">Question (R.

(Tosfos - if it became Pasul, do we burn it in the Azarah, like an animal that never left? Rashi - is it Metamei Begadim? (Rashi later explains like Tosfos, but Chok Noson deletes this 'retraction' from Rashi.) Rambam - if this was before Zerikah, is it Pasul for leaving the Azarah too early?)</p></div>
<div class="indent2"><span class="nm">1.</span><p>Is it as if this limb did not leave at all (so a majority did not leave), or does the part that left join to make a majority?</p></div>
<div class="indent1"><span class="nm">(l)</span><p><span class="cl">Rejection:</span> That would be obvious. The fact that the majority of this limb is inside does not prevail over the fact that the majority of the animal left!</p></div>
<div class="indent1"><span class="nm">(m)</span><p><span class="cl">Correction:</span> Rather, he asked about the majority of a limb that came out, and it helps comprise exactly half of the animal. Do we view it as if the entire limb came out (so a majority has left)?</p></div>
