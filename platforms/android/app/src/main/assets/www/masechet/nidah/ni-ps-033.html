<p class="bas subject"><span class="nm">1)</span>A <i>MISHKAV</i> ABOVE A <i>ZAV</i> OR BELOW A <i>BO'EL NIDAH</i></p>
<p class="bas indent1"><span class="nm">(a)</span><span class="cl">Question:</span> How do we know the law of a Mishkav above a Zav?</p>
<p class="bas indent1"><span class="nm">(b)</span><span class="cl">Answer - Question:</span> It says "v'Chol ha'Noge'a b'Chol Asher Yihyeh Sachtav Yitma". What does "Sachtav" (below) refer to?</p>
<p class="bas indent2"><span class="nm">1.</span><span class="cl">Suggestion:</span> It refers to a Mishkav below a Zav.</p>
<p class="bas indent2"><span class="nm">2.</span>Rejection. "V'Ish Asher Yiga b'Mishkavo" teaches this!</p>
<p class="bas indent2"><span class="nm">3.</span><span class="cl">Answer:</span> Rather, it refers to something above the Zav. (He is below it);</p>
<p class="bas indent3"><span class="nm">i.</span>The verse teaches that it does not have severe Tum'ah, rather, light Tum'ah. It is Metamei only food and drink. (It is a Rishon.)</p>
<p class="bas indent1"><span class="nm">(c)</span><span class="cl">Question:</span> Perhaps the verse teaches that it does not have severe Tum'ah to be Metamei (one who touches it and) Begadim (that he is wearing at the time), but only a lighter Tum'ah, to be Metamei him <i>or</i> Kelim!</p>
<p class="bas indent1"><span class="nm">(d)</span><span class="cl">Answer:</span> "Yitma" connotes that it is Metamei only food and drink.</p>
<p class="bas indent1"><span class="nm">(e)</span><span class="cl">Question:</span> How do we know the law of a Mishkav below a Bo'el Nidah?</p>
<p class="bas indent1"><span class="nm">(f)</span><span class="cl">Answer (Beraisa) Suggestion:</span> Perhaps "u'Sehi Nidasah Alav" teaches that a Bo'el Nidah can become Tahor at the same time as the Nidah he had Bi'ah with (seven days after she became Nidah, regardless of when they had Bi'ah)!</p>
<p class="bas indent2"><span class="nm">1.</span><span class="cl">Rejection:</span> "V'Tamei Shiv'as Yamim."</p>
<p class="bas indent2"><span class="nm">2.</span><span class="cl">Question:</span> If so, why does it say "u'Sehi Nidasah Alav"?</p>
<p class="bas indent2"><span class="nm">3.</span><span class="cl">Answer:</span> One might have thought that he is not Metamei people or Klei Cheres. "U'Sehi Nidasah Alav" teaches that he is Metamei them, like she is.</p>
<p class="bas indent2"><span class="nm">4.</span><span class="cl">Suggestion:</span> Just like her Mishkav is Metamei Begadim, also his is!</p>
<p class="bas indent2"><span class="nm">5.</span><span class="cl">Rejection - Question:</span> Why do we need "v'Chol ha'Mishkav Asher Yishkav Alav Yitma"? Since he is equated to a Nidah, we know that his Mishkav is Tamei!</p>
<p class="bas indent3"><span class="nm">i.</span><span class="cl">Answer:</span> The verse teaches that it does not have severe Tum'ah, rather, light Tum'ah. It is Metamei only food and drink.</p>
<p class="bas indent1"><span class="nm">(g)</span><span class="cl">Question (Rav Achai):</span> Perhaps the verse teaches that it does not have severe Tum'ah to be Metamei Begadim, rather, Tum'ah Kalah, to be Metamei him <i>or</i> Kelim!</p>
<p class="bas indent1"><span class="nm">(h)</span><span class="cl">Answer (Rav Asi):</span> "Yitma" connotes that it is Metamei only food and drink.</p>
<p class="bas indent1"><span class="nm">(i)</span><span class="cl">Question:</span> "U'Sehi Nidasah Alav" is a Klal (general term). "V'Chol ha'Mishkav... " is a Prat (specific term. We should say that the Klal u'Frat teaches only the Prat, i.e. Mishkav u'Moshav (but not people or Klei Cheres)!</p>
<p class="bas indent1"><span class="nm">(j)</span><span class="cl">Answer #1 (Abaye):</span> "V'Tamei Shiv'as Yamim" separates the Klal and Prat, therefore we do not expound according to the law of Klal and Prat.</p>
<p class="bas indent1"><span class="nm">(k)</span><span class="cl">Objection (Rava):</span> Even if the Klal and Prat are separated, we expound Klal and Prat!</p>
<p class="bas indent1"><span class="nm">(l)</span><span class="cl">Answer #2 (Rava):</span> "V'Chol ha'Mishkav... " is not a Klal, rather, a Ribuy (inclusion).</p>
<p class="bas indent1"><span class="nm">(m)</span><span class="cl">Question (R. Yakov):</span> The Torah equated his Tum'ah to hers. Just like (we are stringent to say that) her Mishkav is as Tamei like she is (both are Metamei Begadim), we should be lenient to say that he is no more Tamei than his Mishkav (a Rishon l'Tum'ah)!</p>
<p class="bas indent1"><span class="nm">(n)</span><span class="cl">Answer (Rava):</span> "(U'Sehi Nidasah) Alav" comes to impose stringencies on him.</p>
<p class="bas subject"><span class="nm">2)</span>TUM'AH OF KUSIM</p>
<p class="bas indent1"><span class="nm">(a)</span><span class="cl">(Mishnah):</span> A Kusi... is Bo'el Nidah.</p>
<p class="bas indent1"><span class="nm">(b)</span><span class="cl">Question:</span> Do all Kusim have Bi'ah with Nidos?!</p>
<p class="bas indent1"><span class="nm">(c)</span><span class="cl">Answer (R. Yitzchak Magdela'ah):</span> The Mishnah refers to married Kusi men.</p>
<p class="bas indent2"><span class="nm">1.</span><span class="cl">(Mishnah):</span> Kusi women are assumed to be Teme'os, for they sit (i.e. wait before immersing) due to blood of any color.</p>
<p class="bas indent1"><span class="nm">(d)</span><span class="cl">(Beraisa - R. Meir):</span> If they would <i>wait</i> for (seven days after seeing) blood of any (new) color (i.e. it changed from what they saw at the beginning of Nidah), this would prevent them from sin!</p>
<p class="bas indent2"><span class="nm">1.</span>However, they do not do so, rather, they immerse seven days from the first sighting, even if it was Yarok (which is really Tahor), and they saw red blood later in the week. (They immerse <i>during</i> the (true) days of Nidah, therefore they remain Teme'os.)</p>
<p class="bas indent2"><span class="nm">2.</span>Also, when they become Zavos, they count the last day they saw towards the seven clean days.</p>
<p class="bas indent1"><span class="nm">(e)</span><span class="cl">Question (Rami bar Chama):</span> They may count it, for Miktzas ha'Yom k'Kulo! (Part of the day counts like the whole day.)</p>
<p class="bas indent1"><span class="nm">(f)</span><span class="cl">Answer (Rava):</span> We do not say Miktzas ha'Yom k'Kulo. The Halachah is, if a Zav saw semen, he cannot count that day towards the seven clean days (even though the end of the day was clean)!</p>
<p class="bas indent1"><span class="nm">(g)</span><span class="cl">Rejection (Rami bar Chama):</span> Indeed, if the end of the day was clean, it counts towards the seven clean days;</p>
<p class="bas indent2"><span class="nm">1.</span>It may not be counted if he saw at the end of the day.</p>
<p class="bas indent1"><span class="nm">(h)</span><span class="cl">Question:</span> A verse teaches that he may not count a day when he saw semen. Will we say that the verse applies only when he saw at the last moment of the day?!</p>
<p class="bas indent1"><span class="nm">(i)</span><span class="cl">Answer:</span> Indeed, Rami bar Chama must say so, even though this is difficult.</p>
<p class="bas indent1"><span class="nm">(j)</span><span class="cl">Question (Rami bar Chama):</span> If semen (from a previous act of Bi'ah) exudes from a woman during the seven clean days, does this interrupt her count?</p>
<p class="bas indent2"><span class="nm">1.</span>(Semen that exudes is Metamei even a Tahor woman.). Is this because it is considered as if she saw blood?</p>
<p class="bas bbbline">33b----------------------------------------33b</p>
<p class="bas indent2"><span class="nm">2.</span>Or, is she Teme'ah only because semen touched her?</p>
<p class="bas indent1"><span class="nm">(k)</span><span class="cl">Objection (Rava):</span> Rami's question is ill-founded!</p>
<p class="bas indent2"><span class="nm">1.</span>If it would interrupt her count, how many days would it disqualify?!</p>
<p class="bas indent3"><span class="nm">i.</span>It could not disqualify all the days she counted, and require her to start again from day one. Surely, it is not more stringent than the man from whom the semen came! (Semen interrupts only one day of a Zav's count.)</p>
<p class="bas indent3"><span class="nm">ii.</span>We cannot say that it disqualifies only one day. "V'Achar Tit'har" teaches that she must immerse after all the (seven clean) days were consecutive!</p>
<p class="bas indent2"><span class="nm">2.</span><span class="cl">Counter-question:</span> According to Rava, why does semen interrupt only one day of a Zav's count?</p>
<p class="bas indent3"><span class="nm">i.</span>"L'Taharaso" teaches that there may not be any Tum'ah in the middle (of the seven days)!</p>
<p class="bas indent2"><span class="nm">3.</span><span class="cl">Answer:</span> You must say that "l'Taharaso" teaches that there may not be Tum'as <i>Zivah</i> in the middle;</p>
<p class="bas indent1"><span class="nm">(l)</span><span class="cl">Answer:</span> Likewise, "v'Achar Tit'har" teaches that there may not be Tum'ah of (Dam) Zivah in the middle!</p>
<p class="bas indent1"><span class="nm">(m)</span><span class="cl">(Mishnah):</span> If someone (became Tamei through Kusim and) entered the Mikdash, he does not bring a Korban...</p>
<p class="bas indent1"><span class="nm">(n)</span><span class="cl">Rav Papa (when he went to Tavach):</span> If there is a Chacham here, I want to see him!</p>
<p class="bas indent2"><span class="nm">1.</span><span class="cl">An old woman:</span> There is a Chacham, Rav Shmuel. He teaches Beraisos. Hash-m should grant that you be like him!</p>
<p class="bas indent2"><span class="nm">2.</span><span class="cl">Rav Papa:</span> If she gave me such a blessing, he must fear Shamayim greatly! Rav Papa went to visit him. Rav Shmuel slaughtered an ox in his honor.</p>
<p class="bas indent1"><span class="nm">(o)</span><span class="cl">Question (Rav Shmuel - our Mishnah):</span> We do not obligate a Korban for entering the Mikdash or burn Terumah due to the (assumed) Tum'ah of Kusim, because it is a Safek;</p>
<p class="bas indent2"><span class="nm">1.</span>This shows that we do not burn Terumah due to a Safek;</p>
<p class="bas indent2"><span class="nm">2.</span><span class="cl">Contradiction (Mishnah):</span> In six cases we burn Terumah due to a Safek -- if it became Tamei through clothes of an ignoramus (someone not careful about Tum'ah. (Most) Kusim are ignoramuses... !)</p>
<p class="bas indent1"><span class="nm">(p)</span><span class="cl">Answer #1 (Rav Papa):</span> The case is, the Kusi is a Chaver. (He observes all the Mitzvos properly.)</p>
<p class="bas indent1"><span class="nm">(q)</span><span class="cl">Rejection (Rav Shmuel):</span> He cannot be a Chaver. The Mishnah considers him to be a Bo'el Nidah!</p>
<p class="bas indent1"><span class="nm">(r)</span><span class="cl">Answer #2 (Rav Simi Bar Ashi):</span> (The Kusi is an ignoramus.) The case is, he stepped on a Chaver's garment immediately after immersing, then the garment touched Terumah;</p>
<p class="bas indent2"><span class="nm">1.</span>After a (regular) ignoramus immerses, we assume that he is Tahor;</p>
<p class="bas indent2"><span class="nm">2.</span>In addition, a Kusi is (Muchzak to be) Bo'el Nidah. Immersion is Metaher him unless he was Bo'el Nidah in the last week. His Tum'ah depends on a Sfek Sfeika (there are two independent reasons to be lenient):</p>
<p class="bas indent3"><span class="nm">i.</span>Perhaps he did not have Bi'ah in the last week at all;</p>
<p class="bas indent3"><span class="nm">ii.</span>Even if he had Bi'ah, perhaps his wife was truly Tehorah. (E.g. the last time she became Nidah, her first sighting was red (real Dam Nidah), so she immersed at the proper time.)</p>
<p class="bas indent3"><span class="nm">iii.</span>We do not burn Terumah due to Tum'ah that depends on a Sfek Sfeika!</p>
<p class="bas indent1"><span class="nm">(s)</span><span class="cl">Question:</span> We should burn the Terumah due to the Kusi's clothes!</p>
<p class="bas indent2"><span class="nm">1.</span>An ignoramus' garment is Muchzak to be a Medras with respect to a Chaver! (Perhaps his wife sat on them when she was Nidah, and it is an Av ha'Tum'ah. When the Kusi wears such garments, he is Metamei Begadim, e.g. the Chaver's garment that he stepped on!)</p>
<p class="bas indent1"><span class="nm">(t)</span><span class="cl">Answer:</span> The case is, he was naked when he stepped on the Chaver's garment. (Tosfos - we could have answered that he immersed his garments, or he was wearing a Chaver's garments.)</p>
<p class="bas subject"><span class="nm">3)</span>TUM'AH OF TZEDUKIM</p>
<p class="bas indent1"><span class="nm">(a)</span><span class="cl">(Mishnah):</span> (The Tzedukim kept the Mitzvos according to their mistaken understanding. They did not heed the Oral tradition.) If a Tzeduki's daughter acts like her father, she is considered like a Kusis. If she changes and adopts the ways of Yisraelim, she is considered a Yisraelis;</p>
<p class="bas indent1"><span class="nm">(b)</span>R. Yosi says, she is considered a Yisraelis unless we see that she acts like her father.</p>
<p class="bas indent1"><span class="nm">(c)</span><span class="cl">(Gemara) Question:</span> What does the first Tana say if we do not know how she acts?</p>
<p class="bas indent1"><span class="nm">(d)</span><span class="cl">Answer #1 (Mishnah):</span> If a Tzeduki's daughter acts like her father, she is considered like a Kusis;</p>
<p class="bas indent2"><span class="nm">1.</span><span class="cl">Inference:</span> If we do not know, she is considered a Yisraelis.</p>
<p class="bas indent1"><span class="nm">(e)</span><span class="cl">Contradiction (Mishnah):</span> If she changes and adopts the ways of Yisraelim, she is considered a Yisraelis.</p>
<p class="bas indent2"><span class="nm">1.</span><span class="cl">Inference:</span> If we do not know, she is considered a Kusis!</p>
<p class="bas indent1"><span class="nm">(f)</span><span class="cl">Conclusion:</span> The inferences contradict one another. We cannot resolve the question from the Mishnah.</p>
<p class="bas indent1"><span class="nm">(g)</span><span class="cl">Answer #2 (Mishnah - R. Yosi):</span> She is considered a Yisraelis unless we see that she acts like her father.</p>
<p class="bas indent2"><span class="nm">1.</span><span class="cl">Inference:</span> He argues with the first Tana. The first Tana must say that if we do not know, she is considered a Kusis.</p>
<p class="bas indent1"><span class="nm">(h)</span><span class="cl">(Beraisa):</span> A case occurred in which a Tzeduki was speaking with the Kohen Gadol in the market. Spit from his mouth landed on the Kohen Gadol's garment;</p>
<p class="bas indent2"><span class="nm">1.</span>The Kohen was distressed; he asked the Tzeduki's (Rashi; Maharsha - his own) wife, who told him that Tzedukiyos fear Chaverim. They show their sightings to Chachamim and follow their rulings;</p>
<p class="bas indent2"><span class="nm">2.</span>There was only one Tzedukis who did not do so, and she died.</p>
<p class="bas indent1"><span class="nm">(i)</span><span class="cl">Question:</span> Even if the Tzeduki was not Bo'el Nidah (because his wife acted according to Chachamim), Mayanos (bodily fluids, including spit) of an ignoramus are Avos ha'Tum'ah!</p>
<p class="bas indent1"><span class="nm">(j)</span><span class="cl">Answer #1 (Abaye):</span> The case is, the Tzeduki was a Chaver.</p>
<p class="bas indent1"><span class="nm">(k)</span><span class="cl">Objection (Rava):</span> He could not have been a Chaver, for the Kohen Gadol was concerned that he was Bo'el Nidah!</p>
<p class="bas indent1"><span class="nm">(l)</span><span class="cl">Answer #2 (Rava):</span> This happened during the festival. Ignoramuses are considered Tehorim then:</p>
<p class="bas indent2"><span class="nm">1.</span>"Va'Ye'asef Kol Ish Yisrael El ha'Ir k'Ish Echad Chaverim" -- when Yisrael are together (e.g. on the festivals), all are considered Tehorim.</p>
