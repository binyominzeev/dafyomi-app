<p class="bas subject"><span class="nm">1)</span>WHICH ARAYOS APPLY TO NOCHRIM? (cont.)</p>
<p class="bas indent1"><span class="nm">(a)</span><span class="cl">Question:</span> Does R. Meir really say that a Nochri is commanded only about Arayos that a Yisrael is killed for?! (A Yisrael is not killed for any relatives involving siblings. The following shows that R. Meir forbids a Nochri to maternal aunts and sisters.)</p>
<p class="bas indent2"><span class="nm">1.</span><span class="cl">(Beraisa #2):</span> If a Nochris became pregnant, converted, and gave birth, the child is considered a convert. He may paternal relatives, but he is forbidden to maternal relatives (the Arayos of Nochrim. This is a Rabbinic decree, lest people say that he had more Kedushah (Isurim of incest) while he was a Nochri than after becoming a Yisrael. Mid'Oraisa, he may all his relatives.)</p>
<p class="bas indent2"><span class="nm">2.</span>If he married his maternal sister, he must divorce her. If he married his paternal sister, they may remain married.</p>
<p class="bas indent2"><span class="nm">3.</span>If he married his father's maternal sister, he must divorce her. If he married his father's paternal sister, they may remain married.</p>
<p class="bas indent2"><span class="nm">4.</span>If he married his mother's maternal sister, he must divorce her;</p>
<p class="bas indent2"><span class="nm">5.</span>R. Meir says, if he married his mother's paternal sister, he must divorce her (since there is a maternal tie to her, the decree applies).</p>
<p class="bas indent2"><span class="nm">6.</span>Chachamim say, they may remain married.</p>
<p class="bas indent3"><span class="nm">i.</span>R. Meir says, if he marries any maternal relative, he must divorce her. He may remain married to any paternal relative.</p>
<p class="bas indent2"><span class="nm">7.</span>He may marry the wife of his brother, or of his father's brother, and all other Arayos;</p>
<p class="bas indent3"><span class="nm">i.</span>This comes to include his father's wife.</p>
<p class="bas indent2"><span class="nm">8.</span>If a Nochri married a Nochris and her daughter, and they all converted (the same applies if a Yisrael married two converts, a mother and daughter), he may marry (according to the law of Yisrael) one of them. He must divorce the other;</p>
<p class="bas indent3"><span class="nm">i.</span>L'Chatchilah, he should not marry either.</p>
<p class="bas indent3"><span class="nm">ii.</span><span class="cl">Version #1:</span> If his wife died, he may marry her mother (since Halachah does not consider her to be her mother).</p>
<p class="bas indent3"><span class="nm">iii.</span><span class="cl">Version #2:</span> If his wife died, he may not marry her mother. (This is a decree, lest people think that one may marry his mother-in-law after his wife dies when they are not converts).</p>
<p class="bas indent1"><span class="nm">(b)</span><span class="cl">Answer (Rav Yehudah):</span> In Beraisa #1, R. Meir said that a Nochri is commanded only about Arayos that a Yisrael is killed for. That was according to R. Akiva;</p>
<p class="bas indent2"><span class="nm">1.</span>In Beraisa #2, R. Meir explained according to R. Eliezer (who permits a Nochri to his father's wife, but forbids him to his sister).</p>
<p class="bas indent2"><span class="nm">2.</span><span class="cl">(Beraisa - R. Eliezer):</span> "Al Ken Ya'azov Ish <i>Es Aviv v'Es Imo</i>" forbids a Nochri to the sisters of his parents;</p>
<p class="bas indent2"><span class="nm">3.</span>R. Akiva says, "Aviv" alludes to his father's wife. "Imo" simply refers to his mother.</p>
<p class="bas indent2"><span class="nm">4.</span>"V'Dovak" excludes (forbids) Mishkav Zachar (the Nishkav does not enjoy it. He does not cling to the Shochev);</p>
<p class="bas indent2"><span class="nm">5.</span>"B'Ishto" excludes another's wife;</p>
<p class="bas indent2"><span class="nm">6.</span>"V'Hayu l'Basar Echad" - the union must be (the kind that) can lead to a child. This excludes bestiality.</p>
<p class="bas subject"><span class="nm">2)</span>HOW R. ELIEZER AND R. AKIVA LEARN</p>
<p class="bas indent1"><span class="nm">(a)</span><span class="cl">Question:</span> R. Eliezer says that "Aviv" forbids his father's sister. He should say that it forbids his father!</p>
<p class="bas indent1"><span class="nm">(b)</span><span class="cl">Answer:</span> "V'Dovak" already forbids all Mishkav Zachar.</p>
<p class="bas indent1"><span class="nm">(c)</span><span class="cl">Question:</span> We should say that it forbids his father's wife!</p>
<p class="bas indent1"><span class="nm">(d)</span><span class="cl">Answer:</span> "B'Ishto" forbids all adultery.</p>
<p class="bas indent1"><span class="nm">(e)</span><span class="cl">Question:</span> We should say that "Aviv" forbids his father's wife after his father dies!</p>
<p class="bas indent1"><span class="nm">(f)</span><span class="cl">Answer:</span> "Aviv" resembles "Imo", i.e. it does not depend on marriage.</p>
<p class="bas indent1"><span class="nm">(g)</span><span class="cl">Question:</span> He says that "Imo" forbids his mother's sister. He should say that it forbids his mother!</p>
<p class="bas indent1"><span class="nm">(h)</span><span class="cl">Answer #1:</span> "B'Ishto" forbids all adultery.</p>
<p class="bas indent1"><span class="nm">(i)</span><span class="cl">Question:</span> We should say that "Imo" forbids his mother after his father dies!</p>
<p class="bas indent1"><span class="nm">(j)</span><span class="cl">Answer (and Answer #2 to Question (g)):</span> "Imo" resembles "Aviv", it does not refer to the parent himself (or herself).</p>
<p class="bas indent1"><span class="nm">(k)</span><span class="cl">Question:</span> R. Akiva says that "Aviv" alludes to his father's wife. He should say that it forbids his father!</p>
<p class="bas indent1"><span class="nm">(l)</span><span class="cl">Answer:</span> "V'Dovak" already forbids all Mishkav Zachar.</p>
<p class="bas indent1"><span class="nm">(m)</span><span class="cl">Question:</span> Likewise, "b'Ishto" already forbids his father's wife!</p>
<p class="bas indent1"><span class="nm">(n)</span><span class="cl">Answer:</span> "Aviv" forbids her after his father dies.</p>
<p class="bas indent1"><span class="nm">(o)</span><span class="cl">Question:</span> He says that "Imo" refers to his mother. "B'Ishto" already forbids her!</p>
<p class="bas indent1"><span class="nm">(p)</span><span class="cl">Answer:</span> It forbids his mother if she was never married to his father.</p>
<p class="bas indent1"><span class="nm">(q)</span><span class="cl">Question:</span> What is the source of the argument?</p>
<p class="bas indent1"><span class="nm">(r)</span><span class="cl">Answer:</span> R. Eliezer holds that "Aviv" and "Imo" must resemble each other. Therefore, it must refer to their sisters;</p>
<p class="bas bbbline">58b----------------------------------------58b</p>
<p class="bas indent2"><span class="nm">1.</span>R. Akiva prefers to say that "Aviv" refers to his father's wife, for we find that this is called Ervas Aviv. His father's sister is called She'er (the relative of) Aviv, but not Ervas Aviv.</p>
<p class="bas subject"><span class="nm">3)</span>WHOM MAY A NOCHRI MARRY?</p>
<p class="bas indent1"><span class="nm">(a)</span><span class="cl">Question (against R. Eliezer):</span> "Amram (married) Es Yocheved Dodaso", even though she was the maternal sister of his father!</p>
<p class="bas indent1"><span class="nm">(b)</span><span class="cl">Answer:</span> No, she was only the paternal sister of his father!</p>
<p class="bas indent1"><span class="nm">(c)</span><span class="cl">Question (against R. Akiva):</span> "(Avraham said about Sarah) Achosi Vas Avi Hi Ach Lo Vas Imi." This implies that a maternal sister is forbidden!</p>
<p class="bas indent1"><span class="nm">(d)</span><span class="cl">Objection (and answer):</span> She was not his sister. She was his brother's daughter!</p>
<p class="bas indent2"><span class="nm">1.</span>Therefore, she is permitted in any case (whether her father was a paternal or maternal brother).</p>
<p class="bas indent1"><span class="nm">(e)</span><span class="cl">Answer (to the objection):</span> Avraham justified calling her his sister because she was his father's granddaughter (and grandchildren are like children);</p>
<p class="bas indent2"><span class="nm">1.</span>He said that she was not his mother's daughter, because this was the truth.</p>
<p class="bas indent1"><span class="nm">(f)</span><span class="cl">Question (against R. Akiva - Beraisa):</span> Adam ha'Rishon did not marry his daughter, in order that Kayin could marry her - "Olam Chesed Yibaneh."</p>
<p class="bas indent2"><span class="nm">1.</span><span class="cl">Inference:</span> Normally, one may not marry a sister. It was permitted, in order to populate the world!</p>
<p class="bas indent1"><span class="nm">(g)</span><span class="cl">Answer:</span> Once it was permitted, it remained permitted (for Bnei Noach).</p>
<p class="bas indent1"><span class="nm">(h)</span><span class="cl">Version #1 (Rav Huna):</span> A Nochri may marry his daughter.</p>
<p class="bas indent1"><span class="nm">(i)</span><span class="cl">Question:</span> If so, why didn't Adam ha'Rishon marry his daughter?</p>
<p class="bas indent1"><span class="nm">(j)</span><span class="cl">Answer:</span> He did not, in order that Kayin could marry her - "Olam Chesed Yibaneh."</p>
<p class="bas indent1"><span class="nm">(k)</span><span class="cl">Version #2 (Rav Huna):</span> A Nochri is forbidden to marry his daughter.</p>
<p class="bas indent1"><span class="nm">(l)</span><span class="cl">Support (Rav Huna for himself):</span> This is why Adam ha'Rishon didn't marry his daughter!</p>
<p class="bas indent1"><span class="nm">(m)</span><span class="cl">Rejection:</span> No, it was to enable Kayin to marry her - "Olam Chesed Yibaneh."</p>
<p class="bas indent1"><span class="nm">(n)</span><span class="cl">(Rav Chisda):</span> A (Kena'ani) slave may marry his mother or daughter. (He is a partial convert.) He is no longer a Nochri, but he is not yet a Yisrael.</p>
<p class="bas indent1"><span class="nm">(o)</span><span class="cl">(Rav Dimi):</span> If a Nochri designated a female slave for his male slave (Ploni), and he (the master, or any other Nochri) had Bi'ah with her, he is killed.</p>
<p class="bas indent1"><span class="nm">(p)</span><span class="cl">Question:</span> When is she considered designated?</p>
<p class="bas indent1"><span class="nm">(q)</span><span class="cl">Answer (Rav Nachman):</span> It is from when she is called 'Ploni's girl.'</p>
<p class="bas indent1"><span class="nm">(r)</span><span class="cl">Question:</span> What ends the designation?</p>
<p class="bas indent1"><span class="nm">(s)</span><span class="cl">Answer (Rav Huna):</span> It is when she uncovers her hair in the market.</p>
<p class="bas subject"><span class="nm">4)</span>OTHER THINGS NOCHRIM ARE LIABLE FOR</p>
<p class="bas indent1"><span class="nm">(a)</span><span class="cl">(R. Elazar):</span> A Nochri is killed for abnormal Bi'ah with his wife - "v'Dovak (b'Ishto)" connotes normal Bi'ah.</p>
<p class="bas indent1"><span class="nm">(b)</span><span class="cl">Objection (Rava):</span> We never find that a Yisrael may do something, and a Nochri is killed for it!</p>
<p class="bas indent1"><span class="nm">(c)</span><span class="cl">(Rava):</span> Rather, a Nochri is exempt for abnormal Bi'ah with the wife of his Chaver (another Nochri).</p>
<p class="bas indent1"><span class="nm">(d)</span><span class="cl">Question:</span> What is the reason?</p>
<p class="bas indent1"><span class="nm">(e)</span><span class="cl">Answer:</span> (He will cling) "b'Ishto", but not with his Chaver's wife;</p>
<p class="bas indent2"><span class="nm">1.</span>"V'Dovak" excludes abnormal Bi'ah.</p>
<p class="bas indent1"><span class="nm">(f)</span><span class="cl">(R. Chanina):</span> If a Nochri hit a Yisrael he is killed - "...va'Yach Es ha'Mitzri."</p>
<p class="bas indent1"><span class="nm">(g)</span><span class="cl">(R. Chanina):</span> If one slaps a Yisrael's face, this is like slapping the Shechinah's face - "Mokesh Adam Yala Kodesh."</p>
<p class="bas indent1"><span class="nm">(h)</span><span class="cl">(Reish Lakish):</span> One who raises his hand to strike someone is called a Rasha, even if he did not hit him - "va'Yomer la'Rasha Lamah Sakeh Re'echa";</p>
<p class="bas indent2"><span class="nm">1.</span>It does not say 'why <i>did</i> you hit him?', rather, 'why <i>will</i> you?' He is called a Rasha even without hitting him.</p>
<p class="bas indent1"><span class="nm">(i)</span><span class="cl">(Ze'iri):</span> He is called a Chotei. It says "v'Im Lo Lokachti b'Chazakah" (threatening to take), and it says "va'Tehi Chatas ha'Ne'arim Gedolah Me'od."</p>
<p class="bas indent1"><span class="nm">(j)</span><span class="cl">(Rav Huna):</span> His hand should be cut off - "u'Zro'a Ramah Tishaver."</p>
<p class="bas indent2"><span class="nm">1.</span>Rav Huna cut off the hand of a man who was accustomed to hit people. (Chachamim may give punishments not specified in the Torah when there is a need.)</p>
<p class="bas indent1"><span class="nm">(k)</span><span class="cl">(R. Elazar):</span> He should be killed - "v'Ish Zero'a Lo ha'Aretz." (It is proper that he be bureied in the ground.)</p>
<p class="bas indent1"><span class="nm">(l)</span><span class="cl">(R. Elazar):</span> Only powerful people should own land (for they can deal with quarrels that will arise) - "v'Ish Zero'a Lo ha'Aretz."</p>
<p class="bas indent1"><span class="nm">(m)</span><span class="cl">Question (Reish Lakish):</span> What does it mean "Oved Admaso Yisba Lachem"?</p>
<p class="bas indent1"><span class="nm">(n)</span><span class="cl">Answer:</span> If one works his land as if he were its slave, he will have enough bread. If not, he will not.</p>
<p class="bas indent1"><span class="nm">(o)</span><span class="cl">(Reish Lakish):</span> If a Nochri did not work for an entire day, he is Chayav Misah - "v'Yom v'Laylah Lo Yishbosu";</p>
<p class="bas indent2"><span class="nm">1.</span>A Nochri is Chayav Misah for transgressing any of his Mitzvos.</p>
<p class="bas indent2"><span class="nm">2.</span><span class="cl">(Ravina):</span> He is liable even if he (did not intend to observe our Shabbos or the Nochri 'day of rest', rather, he) ceased on Monday.</p>
<p class="bas indent1"><span class="nm">(p)</span><span class="cl">Question:</span> Why is this not included among his seven Mitzvos?</p>
<p class="bas indent1"><span class="nm">(q)</span><span class="cl">Answer:</span> We list only actions that he must refrain from, but not actions that he must perform.</p>
<p class="bas indent1"><span class="nm">(r)</span><span class="cl">Question:</span> Dinim is included, i.e. he must set up courts!</p>
<p class="bas indent1"><span class="nm">(s)</span><span class="cl">Answer:</span> Dinim is an Aseh and a passive Lav (do not do injustice. The Isur to rest requires doing Melachah.)</p>
