<div class="subject"><span class="nm">1)</span><p>A KOHEN WHO VOWS TO DIVORCE HIS PASUL WIFE</p></div>
<div class="indent1"><span class="nm">(a)</span><p><span class="cl">(Mishnah):</span> If a Kohen married...</p></div>
<div class="indent1"><span class="nm">(b)</span><p><span class="cl">(Beraisa):</span> He vows (not to benefit from her), performs the Avodah, and divorces her after finishing the Avodah.</p></div>
<div class="indent1"><span class="nm">(c)</span><p><span class="cl">Question:</span> We should be concerned lest he go to a Chacham to permit his vow!</p></div>
<div class="indent1"><span class="nm">(d)</span><p><span class="cl">Answer #1:</span> Our Tana holds that one must be Mefaret (tell all details of) a vow before a Chacham may permit it.</p></div>
<div class="indent1"><span class="nm">(e)</span><p><span class="cl">Question:</span> This is like the opinion that one must be Mefaret a vow. According to the opinion that one need not be Mefaret, how can we answer?</p></div>
<div class="indent1"><span class="nm">(f)</span><p><span class="cl">Answer #2:</span> He must vow b'Rabim (in front of many people).</p></div>
<div class="indent1"><span class="nm">(g)</span><p><span class="cl">Question:</span> This is like the opinion that a vow b'Rabim cannot be permitted. According to the opinion that it can be permitted, how can we answer?</p></div>
<div class="indent1"><span class="nm">(h)</span><p><span class="cl">Answer #3:</span> He must vow Al Da'as Rabim (according to the will of many people);</p></div>
<div class="indent2"><span class="nm">1.</span><p><span class="cl">(Ameimar):</span> Even according to the opinion that a vow b'Rabim can be permitted, a vow Al Da'as Rabim cannot be permitted.</p></div>
<div class="indent2"><span class="nm">2.</span><p>It cannot be permitted for Reshus, but it can be permitted for a Mitzvah.</p></div>
<div class="indent3"><span class="nm">i.</span><p>There was a teacher (of children) who used to strike his students too much. Rav Acha made him vow Al Da'as Rabim that he would not teach children again;</p></div>
<div class="indent3"><span class="nm">ii.</span><p>Ravina (annulled the vow and) reinstated him, because he could not find someone else that taught so precisely.</p></div>
<div class="indent1"><span class="nm">(i)</span><p><span class="cl">(Mishnah):</span> If a Kohen (habitually) becomes Tamei Mes...</p></div>
<div class="indent1"><span class="nm">(j)</span><p><span class="cl">Question:</span> Why does it suffice for him merely to accept not to do so again, but a Kohen in a forbidden marriage must vow?</p></div>
<div class="indent1"><span class="nm">(k)</span><p><span class="cl">Answer:</span> There is less temptation to become Tamei, so we are not concerned lest he not honor his acceptance.</p></div>
<div class="perekline">PEREK YESH BECHOR</div>
<div class="subject"><span class="nm">2)</span><p>BECHOR FOR INHERITANCE AND PIDYON</p></div>
<div class="indent1"><span class="nm">(a)</span><p><span class="cl">(Mishnah):</span> A boy can be a Bechor regarding inheritance (to get a double portion), but not regarding (the Mitzvah to be redeemed by giving five Shekalim to a) Kohen;</p></div>
<div class="indent2"><span class="nm">1.</span><p>One can be a Bechor for Kohen, but not for inheritance;</p></div>
<div class="indent2"><span class="nm">2.</span><p>One can be a Bechor for both, or for neither.</p></div>
<div class="indent1"><span class="nm">(b)</span><p>The following are Bechoros only for inheritance:</p></div>
<div class="indent2"><span class="nm">1.</span><p>He was born after a Nefel (non-viable baby), even if the Nefel was alive when its head left womb;</p></div>
<div class="indent2"><span class="nm">2.</span><p>He was born after a nine month (viable) baby that died before its head left womb;</p></div>
<div class="indent2"><span class="nm">3.</span><p>R. Meir says also one who was born after a miscarriage of a baby (with a face) resembling a Chayah, Behemah or bird;</p></div>
<div class="indent2"><span class="nm">4.</span><p>Chachamim say, the first must have a human form (if not, the next is a Bechor for both).</p></div>
<div class="indent2"><span class="nm">5.</span><p>He was born after a miscarriage of a Sandal (a fetus that was mashed, it lost its shape), Shilya (fetal sac) or Shefir Merukam (the outer skin of a fetus before bones form);</p></div>
<div class="indent2"><span class="nm">6.</span><p>He was born after a baby whose limbs came out disconnected.</p></div>
<div class="indent2"><span class="nm">7.</span><p>He is the first child of a man who married a woman with children (from a previous marriage).</p></div>
<div class="indent2"><span class="nm">8.</span><p>He is the first child of a Nochris or slave after her conversion or freedom, she had previous children.</p></div>
<div class="indent2"><span class="nm">9.</span><p>R. Yosi ha'Gelili says the first child (after conversion or freedom) is a Bechor even regarding Pidyon, for this depends on "Peter (Kol) Rechem bi'Venei Yisrael" (her first birth when she is a Yisraelis.)</p></div>
<div class="indent1"><span class="nm">(c)</span><p>In the following cases, the (next) child will be a Bechor for Pidyon, but not for inheritance;</p></div>
<div class="indent2"><span class="nm">1.</span><p>A man with children married a woman without children;</p></div>
<div class="indent2"><span class="nm">2.</span><p>A pregnant Nochris or slave (who had not yet given birth) converted or was freed.</p></div>
<div class="indent2"><span class="nm">3.</span><p>A woman gave birth for the first time, the baby became mixed up with a baby (who is exempt from Pidyon, i.e.) of a Kohenes, Leviyah or a woman with previous children;</p></div>
<div class="indent2"><span class="nm">4.</span><p>A widow or divorcee remarried within three months (and gave birth within nine months after leaving her first husband). We do not know whether it is a nine-month baby from her first husband, or a seven-month baby from her new husband. (The son must redeem himself when he grows up.)</p></div>
<div class="bbbline">46b----------------------------------------46b</p></div>
<div class="indent1"><span class="nm">(d)</span><p><span class="cl">(Gemara - Shmuel):</span> If the head of a Nefel left the womb, this is not considered birth (to exempt the next baby from Pidyon).</p></div>
<div class="indent1"><span class="nm">(e)</span><p><span class="cl">Question:</span> What is the reason?</p></div>
<div class="indent1"><span class="nm">(f)</span><p><span class="cl">Answer:</span> "Kol Asher Nishmas Ru'ach Chayim b'Apav" - the nose (or head) is important only regarding something that can live.</p></div>
<div class="indent1"><span class="nm">(g)</span><p><span class="cl">Question (Mishnah):</span> A baby born after a Nefel whose head came out alive, or after a nine-month baby whose head came out dead (is a Bechor for inheritance, but not for Pidyon).</p></div>
<div class="indent2"><span class="nm">1.</span><p>This shows that birth of a Nefel's head is considered birth regarding Pidyon!</p></div>
<div class="indent1"><span class="nm">(h)</span><p><span class="cl">Answer:</span> "Head" really refers to the majority of the body.</p></div>
<div class="indent1"><span class="nm">(i)</span><p><span class="cl">Question:</span> If so, why didn't the Tana explicitly say this?</p></div>
<div class="indent1"><span class="nm">(j)</span><p><span class="cl">Answer:</span> He said "head" for parallel structure with the Seifa, which discusses a nine-month baby whose head came out dead;</p></div>
<div class="indent2"><span class="nm">1.</span><p>There, he needed to say "head", so we can infer that had the head came out alive, the next child would not be a Bechor for inheritance, and not for Pidyon.</p></div>
<div class="indent1"><span class="nm">(k)</span><p><span class="cl">Question:</span> The Chidush (that we infer from the Seifa) is that birth of the head of a viable baby is considered (full) birth. Another Mishnah teaches this!</p></div>
<div class="indent2"><span class="nm">1.</span><p><span class="cl">(Mishnah):</span> If it stuck out its head, even if it returned it, it is as if the fetus was born.</p></div>
<div class="indent1"><span class="nm">(l)</span><p><span class="cl">Suggestion:</span> Perhaps that teaches about an animal, and our Mishnah teaches about a human.</p></div>
<div class="indent1"><span class="nm">(m)</span><p><span class="cl">Rejection:</span> Another Mishnah teaches this (regarding people)!</p></div>
<div class="indent2"><span class="nm">1.</span><p><span class="cl">(Mishnah):</span> If a baby is born normally (head-first), once the majority of the head comes out, i.e. the forehead, it is considered born.</p></div>
<div class="indent1"><span class="nm">(n)</span><p>Shmuel is refuted. (Sefas Emes asks that surely, Shmuel knew the Mishnah! He answers that Shmuel holds like Reish Lakish (below) that the forehead is not enough to be considered birth regarding inheritance. We do not learn this from the other Mishnah. The Gemara holds like R. Yochanan, therefore it says that Shmuel is refuted.)</p></div>
<div class="subject"><span class="nm">3)</span><p>DOES THE FOREHEAD SUFFICE?</p></div>
<div class="indent1"><span class="nm">(a)</span><p><span class="cl">(Reish Lakish):</span> Emergence of the forehead is considered birth in every respect except for inheritance, for it says "Yakir" (the entire face must leave for proper recognition);</p></div>
<div class="indent1"><span class="nm">(b)</span><p><span class="cl">(R. Yochanan):</span> It is enough even regarding inheritance.</p></div>
<div class="indent1"><span class="nm">(c)</span><p><span class="cl">Question:</span> What does Reish Lakish include by saying "in every respect"?</p></div>
<div class="indent1"><span class="nm">(d)</span><p><span class="cl">Answer:</span> He teaches like the following Beraisa:</p></div>
<div class="indent2"><span class="nm">1.</span><p><span class="cl">(Beraisa):</span> If a Nochris was giving birth, and the forehead came out, and then she converted, and then the entire baby came out, Tum'ah and Korban of a Yoledes do not apply to her (because Halachic birth preceded her conversion).</p></div>
<div class="indent1"><span class="nm">(e)</span><p><span class="cl">Question (against R. Yochanan - Beraisa):</span> "Yakir" refers to recognition of the face, i.e. with the nose.</p></div>
<div class="indent1"><span class="nm">(f)</span><p><span class="cl">Answer:</span> It should say "<i>until</i> (but not including) the nose."</p></div>
<div class="indent1"><span class="nm">(g)</span><p><span class="cl">Question (Mishnah):</span> To give Edus Ishah (to testify that a man died to permit his widow to remarry), one must see the face with the nose. (This is difficult even for Reish Lakish, who says that the forehead suffices for everything except for inheritance!)</p></div>
<div class="indent1"><span class="nm">(h)</span><p><span class="cl">Answer #1:</span> It should say "until the nose."</p></div>
<div class="indent1"><span class="nm">(i)</span><p><span class="cl">Question (Mishnah):</span> One cannot testify that a man died if he saw only the face <i>or</i> forehead. He must see both, with the nose.</p></div>
<div class="indent2"><span class="nm">1.</span><p><span class="cl">(Abaye):</span> We learn from "Hakaras Panim Ansah Bam."</p></div>
<div class="indent1"><span class="nm">(j)</span><p><span class="cl">Answer #1:</span> (Normally, the forehead suffices.) Chachamim were more stringent about Edus Ishah.</p></div>
<div class="indent1"><span class="nm">(k)</span><p><span class="cl">Objection:</span> Chachamim were more <i>lenient</i> about Edus Ishah than normal testimony!</p></div>
<div class="indent2"><span class="nm">1.</span><p><span class="cl">(Mishnah):</span> It became established to accept (for Edus Ishah) Ed mi'Pi Ed (one testifies about what he heard from a witness), or (even) what one heard from a woman or slave.</p></div>
<div class="indent1"><span class="nm">(l)</span><p><span class="cl">Answer #2 (to both questions):</span> Chachamim were more lenient about who may testify, but they were more stringent about what the witness must see.</p></div>
<div class="indent1"><span class="nm">(m)</span><p><span class="cl">Answer #3 (to both questions):</span> "Hakaras Panim" requires the face, forehead and nose to identify a person (Shev Shemaitsa 7:16 - through Simanim, e.g. a long, flat nose, for one who does not recognize the person), "Yakir" does not require this.</p></div>
