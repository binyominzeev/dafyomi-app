<p class="bas subject"><span class="nm">1)</span>A KOHEN WHO VOWS TO DIVORCE HIS <i>PASUL</i> WIFE</p>
<p class="bas indent1"><span class="nm">(a)</span><span class="cl">(Mishnah):</span> If a Kohen married...</p>
<p class="bas indent1"><span class="nm">(b)</span><span class="cl">(Beraisa):</span> He vows (not to benefit from her), performs the Avodah, and divorces her after finishing the Avodah.</p>
<p class="bas indent1"><span class="nm">(c)</span><span class="cl">Question:</span> We should be concerned lest he go to a Chacham to permit his vow!</p>
<p class="bas indent1"><span class="nm">(d)</span><span class="cl">Answer #1:</span> Our Tana holds that one must be Mefaret (tell all details of) a vow before a Chacham may permit it.</p>
<p class="bas indent1"><span class="nm">(e)</span><span class="cl">Question:</span> This is like the opinion that one must be Mefaret a vow. According to the opinion that one need not be Mefaret, how can we answer?</p>
<p class="bas indent1"><span class="nm">(f)</span><span class="cl">Answer #2:</span> He must vow b'Rabim (in front of many people).</p>
<p class="bas indent1"><span class="nm">(g)</span><span class="cl">Question:</span> This is like the opinion that a vow b'Rabim cannot be permitted. According to the opinion that it can be permitted, how can we answer?</p>
<p class="bas indent1"><span class="nm">(h)</span><span class="cl">Answer #3:</span> He must vow Al Da'as Rabim (according to the will of many people);</p>
<p class="bas indent2"><span class="nm">1.</span><span class="cl">(Ameimar):</span> Even according to the opinion that a vow b'Rabim can be permitted, a vow Al Da'as Rabim cannot be permitted.</p>
<p class="bas indent2"><span class="nm">2.</span>It cannot be permitted for Reshus, but it can be permitted for a Mitzvah.</p>
<p class="bas indent3"><span class="nm">i.</span>There was a teacher (of children) who used to strike his students too much. Rav Acha made him vow Al Da'as Rabim that he would not teach children again;</p>
<p class="bas indent3"><span class="nm">ii.</span>Ravina (annulled the vow and) reinstated him, because he could not find someone else that taught so precisely.</p>
<p class="bas indent1"><span class="nm">(i)</span><span class="cl">(Mishnah):</span> If a Kohen (habitually) becomes Tamei Mes...</p>
<p class="bas indent1"><span class="nm">(j)</span><span class="cl">Question:</span> Why does it suffice for him merely to accept not to do so again, but a Kohen in a forbidden marriage must vow?</p>
<p class="bas indent1"><span class="nm">(k)</span><span class="cl">Answer:</span> There is less temptation to become Tamei, so we are not concerned lest he not honor his acceptance.</p>
<p class="perekline">PEREK YESH BECHOR</p>
<p class="bas subject"><span class="nm">2)</span><i>BECHOR</i> FOR INHERITANCE AND <i>PIDYON</i></p>
<p class="bas indent1"><span class="nm">(a)</span><span class="cl">(Mishnah):</span> A boy can be a Bechor regarding inheritance (to get a double portion), but not regarding (the Mitzvah to be redeemed by giving five Shekalim to a) Kohen;</p>
<p class="bas indent2"><span class="nm">1.</span>One can be a Bechor for Kohen, but not for inheritance;</p>
<p class="bas indent2"><span class="nm">2.</span>One can be a Bechor for both, or for neither.</p>
<p class="bas indent1"><span class="nm">(b)</span>The following are Bechoros only for inheritance:</p>
<p class="bas indent2"><span class="nm">1.</span>He was born after a Nefel (non-viable baby), even if the Nefel was alive when its head left womb;</p>
<p class="bas indent2"><span class="nm">2.</span>He was born after a nine month (viable) baby that died before its head left womb;</p>
<p class="bas indent2"><span class="nm">3.</span>R. Meir says also one who was born after a miscarriage of a baby (with a face) resembling a Chayah, Behemah or bird;</p>
<p class="bas indent2"><span class="nm">4.</span>Chachamim say, the first must have a human form (if not, the next is a Bechor for both).</p>
<p class="bas indent2"><span class="nm">5.</span>He was born after a miscarriage of a Sandal (a fetus that was mashed, it lost its shape), Shilya (fetal sac) or Shefir Merukam (the outer skin of a fetus before bones form);</p>
<p class="bas indent2"><span class="nm">6.</span>He was born after a baby whose limbs came out disconnected.</p>
<p class="bas indent2"><span class="nm">7.</span>He is the first child of a man who married a woman with children (from a previous marriage).</p>
<p class="bas indent2"><span class="nm">8.</span>He is the first child of a Nochris or slave after her conversion or freedom, she had previous children.</p>
<p class="bas indent2"><span class="nm">9.</span>R. Yosi ha'Gelili says the first child (after conversion or freedom) is a Bechor even regarding Pidyon, for this depends on "Peter (Kol) Rechem bi'Venei Yisrael" (her first birth when she is a Yisraelis.)</p>
<p class="bas indent1"><span class="nm">(c)</span>In the following cases, the (next) child will be a Bechor for Pidyon, but not for inheritance;</p>
<p class="bas indent2"><span class="nm">1.</span>A man with children married a woman without children;</p>
<p class="bas indent2"><span class="nm">2.</span>A pregnant Nochris or slave (who had not yet given birth) converted or was freed.</p>
<p class="bas indent2"><span class="nm">3.</span>A woman gave birth for the first time, the baby became mixed up with a baby (who is exempt from Pidyon, i.e.) of a Kohenes, Leviyah or a woman with previous children;</p>
<p class="bas indent2"><span class="nm">4.</span>A widow or divorcee remarried within three months (and gave birth within nine months after leaving her first husband). We do not know whether it is a nine-month baby from her first husband, or a seven-month baby from her new husband. (The son must redeem himself when he grows up.)</p>
<p class="bas bbbline">46b----------------------------------------46b</p>
<p class="bas indent1"><span class="nm">(d)</span><span class="cl">(Gemara - Shmuel):</span> If the head of a Nefel left the womb, this is not considered birth (to exempt the next baby from Pidyon).</p>
<p class="bas indent1"><span class="nm">(e)</span><span class="cl">Question:</span> What is the reason?</p>
<p class="bas indent1"><span class="nm">(f)</span><span class="cl">Answer:</span> "Kol Asher Nishmas Ru'ach Chayim b'Apav" - the nose (or head) is important only regarding something that can live.</p>
<p class="bas indent1"><span class="nm">(g)</span><span class="cl">Question (Mishnah):</span> A baby born after a Nefel whose head came out alive, or after a nine-month baby whose head came out dead (is a Bechor for inheritance, but not for Pidyon).</p>
<p class="bas indent2"><span class="nm">1.</span>This shows that birth of a Nefel's head is considered birth regarding Pidyon!</p>
<p class="bas indent1"><span class="nm">(h)</span><span class="cl">Answer:</span> "Head" really refers to the majority of the body.</p>
<p class="bas indent1"><span class="nm">(i)</span><span class="cl">Question:</span> If so, why didn't the Tana explicitly say this?</p>
<p class="bas indent1"><span class="nm">(j)</span><span class="cl">Answer:</span> He said "head" for parallel structure with the Seifa, which discusses a nine-month baby whose head came out dead;</p>
<p class="bas indent2"><span class="nm">1.</span>There, he needed to say "head", so we can infer that had the head came out alive, the next child would not be a Bechor for inheritance, and not for Pidyon.</p>
<p class="bas indent1"><span class="nm">(k)</span><span class="cl">Question:</span> The Chidush (that we infer from the Seifa) is that birth of the head of a viable baby is considered (full) birth. Another Mishnah teaches this!</p>
<p class="bas indent2"><span class="nm">1.</span><span class="cl">(Mishnah):</span> If it stuck out its head, even if it returned it, it is as if the fetus was born.</p>
<p class="bas indent1"><span class="nm">(l)</span><span class="cl">Suggestion:</span> Perhaps that teaches about an animal, and our Mishnah teaches about a human.</p>
<p class="bas indent1"><span class="nm">(m)</span><span class="cl">Rejection:</span> Another Mishnah teaches this (regarding people)!</p>
<p class="bas indent2"><span class="nm">1.</span><span class="cl">(Mishnah):</span> If a baby is born normally (head-first), once the majority of the head comes out, i.e. the forehead, it is considered born.</p>
<p class="bas indent1"><span class="nm">(n)</span>Shmuel is refuted. (Sefas Emes asks that surely, Shmuel knew the Mishnah! He answers that Shmuel holds like Reish Lakish (below) that the forehead is not enough to be considered birth regarding inheritance. We do not learn this from the other Mishnah. The Gemara holds like R. Yochanan, therefore it says that Shmuel is refuted.)</p>
<p class="bas subject"><span class="nm">3)</span>DOES THE FOREHEAD SUFFICE?</p>
<p class="bas indent1"><span class="nm">(a)</span><span class="cl">(Reish Lakish):</span> Emergence of the forehead is considered birth in every respect except for inheritance, for it says "Yakir" (the entire face must leave for proper recognition);</p>
<p class="bas indent1"><span class="nm">(b)</span><span class="cl">(R. Yochanan):</span> It is enough even regarding inheritance.</p>
<p class="bas indent1"><span class="nm">(c)</span><span class="cl">Question:</span> What does Reish Lakish include by saying "in every respect"?</p>
<p class="bas indent1"><span class="nm">(d)</span><span class="cl">Answer:</span> He teaches like the following Beraisa:</p>
<p class="bas indent2"><span class="nm">1.</span><span class="cl">(Beraisa):</span> If a Nochris was giving birth, and the forehead came out, and then she converted, and then the entire baby came out, Tum'ah and Korban of a Yoledes do not apply to her (because Halachic birth preceded her conversion).</p>
<p class="bas indent1"><span class="nm">(e)</span><span class="cl">Question (against R. Yochanan - Beraisa):</span> "Yakir" refers to recognition of the face, i.e. with the nose.</p>
<p class="bas indent1"><span class="nm">(f)</span><span class="cl">Answer:</span> It should say "<i>until</i> (but not including) the nose."</p>
<p class="bas indent1"><span class="nm">(g)</span><span class="cl">Question (Mishnah):</span> To give Edus Ishah (to testify that a man died to permit his widow to remarry), one must see the face with the nose. (This is difficult even for Reish Lakish, who says that the forehead suffices for everything except for inheritance!)</p>
<p class="bas indent1"><span class="nm">(h)</span><span class="cl">Answer #1:</span> It should say "until the nose."</p>
<p class="bas indent1"><span class="nm">(i)</span><span class="cl">Question (Mishnah):</span> One cannot testify that a man died if he saw only the face <i>or</i> forehead. He must see both, with the nose.</p>
<p class="bas indent2"><span class="nm">1.</span><span class="cl">(Abaye):</span> We learn from "Hakaras Panim Ansah Bam."</p>
<p class="bas indent1"><span class="nm">(j)</span><span class="cl">Answer #1:</span> (Normally, the forehead suffices.) Chachamim were more stringent about Edus Ishah.</p>
<p class="bas indent1"><span class="nm">(k)</span><span class="cl">Objection:</span> Chachamim were more <i>lenient</i> about Edus Ishah than normal testimony!</p>
<p class="bas indent2"><span class="nm">1.</span><span class="cl">(Mishnah):</span> It became established to accept (for Edus Ishah) Ed mi'Pi Ed (one testifies about what he heard from a witness), or (even) what one heard from a woman or slave.</p>
<p class="bas indent1"><span class="nm">(l)</span><span class="cl">Answer #2 (to both questions):</span> Chachamim were more lenient about who may testify, but they were more stringent about what the witness must see.</p>
<p class="bas indent1"><span class="nm">(m)</span><span class="cl">Answer #3 (to both questions):</span> "Hakaras Panim" requires the face, forehead and nose to identify a person (Shev Shemaitsa 7:16 - through Simanim, e.g. a long, flat nose, for one who does not recognize the person), "Yakir" does not require this.</p>
