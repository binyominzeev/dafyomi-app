<div class="subject"><span class="nm">1)</span><p>THE <i>SHEMITAH</i> STATUS OF AN ESROG (cont.)</p></div>
<div class="indent1"><span class="nm">(a)</span><p><span class="cl">Question:</span> But even those (R. Gamliel and R. Eliezer) who argue about the dating of the Ma'aser status of an Esrog, agree that its Shemitah status is determined by its budding, not its picking!?</p></div>
<div class="indent1"><span class="nm">(b)</span><p><span class="cl">Answer:</span> Our Tana (who singles out the Esrog) holds like the Rabanan who argue with Avtulmus in the Beraisa.</p></div>
<div class="indent2"><span class="nm">1.</span><p>R. Yosi cites Avtulmus who testified that an Esrog follows its date of picking.</p></div>
<div class="indent2"><span class="nm">2.</span><p>The Rabanan voted that its date is the same for Ma'aser and Shemitah.</p></div>
<div class="indent2"><span class="nm">3.</span><p><span class="cl">Question:</span> Who introduced Shemitah into this discussion?</p></div>
<div class="indent2"><span class="nm">4.</span><p><span class="cl">Answer:</span> The emended version of Avtulmus' testimony reads that an Esrog follows picking for Ma'aser and budding for Shemitah.</p></div>
<div class="indent2"><span class="nm">5.</span><p>It was regarding that statement that the Rabanan voted to view the picking as the date for both Ma'aser and Shemitah.</p></div>
<div class="subject"><span class="nm">2)</span><p>LULAV OF SHEMITAH</p></div>
<div class="indent1"><span class="nm">(a)</span><p><span class="cl">Question:</span> A Lulav should not have Kedushas Shevi'is!?</p></div>
<div class="indent2"><span class="nm">1.</span><p>We implied before that it only does not have Kedushas Shevi'is because it is from the sixth year.</p></div>
<div class="indent2"><span class="nm">2.</span><p>But it should be like wood (which does not have Kedushas Shevi'is, as taught in the Beraisa), not like food!</p></div>
<div class="indent1"><span class="nm">(b)</span><p><span class="cl">Answer:</span> Wood is only excluded from Kedushas Shevi'is when it is being used for the coals it produces, such that its benefit is not realized as the time it is consumed.</p></div>
<div class="indent1"><span class="nm">(c)</span><p><span class="cl">Question:</span> But there are oil-trees which may be lit as torches (the benefit being realized as it is consumed)!?</p></div>
<div class="indent1"><span class="nm">(d)</span><p><span class="cl">Answer (Rava):</span> That does not change the normal assumption for wood as firewood.</p></div>
<div class="subject"><span class="nm">3)</span><p>KEDUSHAS SHEVI'IS OF FIREWOOD</p></div>
<div class="indent1"><span class="nm">(a)</span><p>The assumption that firewood is not subject to Kedushas Shevi'is is actually a Machlokes Tanaim.</p></div>
<div class="indent1"><span class="nm">(b)</span><p><span class="cl">(Tana Kama):</span> Shevi'is wine may be not be used for non- drinking purposes (soaking, cleaning).</p></div>
<div class="indent1"><span class="nm">(c)</span><p><span class="cl">(R. Yosi):</span> It may be used for those purposes.</p></div>
<div class="indent1"><span class="nm">(d)</span><p><span class="cl">Question:</span> What is the rationale of the Tana Kama?</p></div>
<div class="indent1"><span class="nm">(e)</span><p><span class="cl">Answer:</span> The word l'Achlah limits the use of the Shemitah produce.</p></div>
<div class="indent1"><span class="nm">(f)</span><p><span class="cl">Question:</span> What is the rationale of R. Yosi?</p></div>
<div class="indent1"><span class="nm">(g)</span><p><span class="cl">Answer:</span> <i>Lachem</i> (l'Achlah) allows all uses.</p></div>
<div class="indent1"><span class="nm">(h)</span><p><span class="cl">Question:</span> How will Tana Kama interpret Lachem?</p></div>
<div class="indent1"><span class="nm">(i)</span><p><span class="cl">Answer:</span> The permitted uses must be similar to eating (the benefit being realized as it is consumed, unlike soaking or washing).</p></div>
<div class="indent1"><span class="nm">(j)</span><p><span class="cl">Question:</span> How will R. Yosi interpret l'Achlah?</p></div>
<div class="indent1"><span class="nm">(k)</span><p><span class="cl">Answer:</span> To prohibit its use for (non-universal) medicinal purposes (as derived in the Beraisa).</p></div>
<div class="indent2"><span class="nm">1.</span><p>The Beraisa learns the prohibition of using Shemitah produce for non-universal medicinal purposes from l'Achlah.</p></div>
<div class="indent2"><span class="nm">2.</span><p><span class="cl">Question:</span> Perhaps l'Achlah prohibits using it for washing or soaking?</p></div>
<div class="indent2"><span class="nm">3.</span><p><span class="cl">Answer:</span> Lachem already permits those.</p></div>
<div class="indent2"><span class="nm">4.</span><p><span class="cl">Question:</span> Why permit (include) soaking and washing while prohibiting (exclude) medicinal purposes, and not the reverse?</p></div>
<div class="bbbline">40b----------------------------------------40b</p></div>
<div class="indent2"><span class="nm">5.</span><p>It is more likely to include soaking and washing which are universally needed activities.</p></div>
<div class="indent1"><span class="nm">(l)</span><p><span class="cl">Question:</span> Which Tana taught that Shemitah produce may not be used as medicine, fragrance or to induce vomiting?</p></div>
<div class="indent1"><span class="nm">(m)</span><p><span class="cl">Answer:</span> It must be R. Yosi, since Rabanan would also prohibit soaking and washing.</p></div>
<div class="subject"><span class="nm">4)</span><p>METHODS FOR REMOVING KEDUSHAS SHEVI'IS</p></div>
<div class="indent1"><span class="nm">(a)</span><p><span class="cl">(R. Elazar):</span> The Kedushah may only be transferred when the Shemitah produce is sold (not through Chilul).</p></div>
<div class="indent1"><span class="nm">(b)</span><p><span class="cl">(R. Yochanan):</span> Both methods may be used.</p></div>
<div class="indent2"><span class="nm">1.</span><p><span class="cl">Question:</span> What is the rationale of R. Elazar?</p></div>
<div class="indent2"><span class="nm">2.</span><p><span class="cl">Answer:</span> The juxtaposition of Yovel (like Shevi'is) to redemption through sale.</p></div>
<div class="indent2"><span class="nm">3.</span><p><span class="cl">Question:</span> What is the rationale of R. Yochanan?</p></div>
<div class="indent2"><span class="nm">4.</span><p><span class="cl">Answer:</span> Yovel is called Kodesh (which is subject to both forms of redemption).</p></div>
<div class="indent2"><span class="nm">5.</span><p><span class="cl">Question:</span> How will R. Yochanan interpret the juxtaposition of Yovel to redemption through sale?</p></div>
<div class="indent2"><span class="nm">6.</span><p><span class="cl">Answer:</span> It teaches the severe consequence of tampering with the laws of Shemitah (resulting in a forced sale of one's property and, eventually, of one's self).</p></div>
<div class="indent2"><span class="nm">7.</span><p><span class="cl">Question:</span> How will R. Elazar interpret the Pasuk calling Yovel Kodesh?</p></div>
<div class="indent2"><span class="nm">8.</span><p><span class="cl">Answer:</span> The redemption onto money follows the same pattern as by redemption of Hekdesh.</p></div>
<div class="indent1"><span class="nm">(c)</span><p>A Beraisa supports each, R. Elazar and R. Yochanan.</p></div>
<div class="indent2"><span class="nm">1.</span><p>The Beraisa seems to support R. Elazar because it discusses the details of redemption always in terms of Lakach, a sale.</p></div>
<div class="indent2"><span class="nm">2.</span><p>The Beraisa supports R. Yochanan in speaking of Chilul.</p></div>
<div class="indent3"><span class="nm">i.</span><p><span class="cl">(R. Meir):</span> The Chilul of Kedushas Shevi'is as well as Ma'aser Sheni may be made on live or slaughtered animals.</p></div>
<div class="indent3"><span class="nm">ii.</span><p><span class="cl">(Chachamim):</span> Live animals may not be used lest a person raise the animals instead of bringing them to Yerushalayim.</p></div>
<div class="indent3"><span class="nm">iii.</span><p><span class="cl">(Rava):</span> This Machlokes applies only to male animals; but all agree that live females may not be used for Chilul lest he raise them.</p></div>
