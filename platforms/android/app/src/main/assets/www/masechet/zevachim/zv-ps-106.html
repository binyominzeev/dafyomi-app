<div class="indent1"><span class="nm">(a)</span><p><span class="cl">(Continuation of Beraisa - R. Yosi ha'Galili):</span> They are burned in Beis ha'Deshen ("Al Shefech ha'Deshen" teaches that there are already ashes there from before.)</p></div>
<div class="indent1"><span class="nm">(b)</span><p><span class="cl">(Rava):</span> R. Eliezer ben Yakov argues with R. Yosi ha'Galili:</p></div>
<div class="indent2"><span class="nm">1.</span><p><span class="cl">(Beraisa):</span> "Al Shefech ha'Deshen Yisaref" - there are already ashes there from before;</p></div>
<div class="indent2"><span class="nm">2.</span><p>R. Eliezer ben Yakov says, the place must be sloped (so the ashes pour.)</p></div>
<div class="indent1"><span class="nm">(c)</span><p><span class="cl">Objection (Abaye):</span> Perhaps R. Eliezer ben Yakov agrees that there must be ashes there from before, and he <i>also</i> requires that it is sloped!</p></div>
<div class="indent1"><span class="nm">(d)</span><p><span class="cl">(Beraisa):</span> The one who burns it is Metamei Begadim, but not the one who lit the fire or arranged the Ma'arachah (the woodpile on the Mizbe'ach).</p></div>
<div class="indent2"><span class="nm">1.</span><p><span class="cl">Question:</span> What is considered one who burns?</p></div>
<div class="indent2"><span class="nm">2.</span><p><span class="cl">Answer:</span> It is anyone who helps while it is burning.</p></div>
<div class="indent2"><span class="nm">3.</span><p><span class="cl">Suggestion:</span> Perhaps even one who helps after it became ashes is Metamei Begadim!</p></div>
<div class="indent2"><span class="nm">4.</span><p><span class="cl">Rejection:</span> "Osam" - while they are Parim and Se'irim, one who burns is Metamei Begadim, not after they are ashes;</p></div>
<div class="indent1"><span class="nm">(e)</span><p>R. Shimon says, one who burns "Osam" is Metamei Begadim, but not after the meat melted.</p></div>
<div class="indent1"><span class="nm">(f)</span><p><span class="cl">Question:</span> What is the difference between these opinions?</p></div>
<div class="indent1"><span class="nm">(g)</span><p><span class="cl">Answer:</span> They argue about when the meat was charred. (R. Shimon is Metaher, and Chachamim are Metamei.)</p></div>

<div class="indent1"><span class="nm">(a)</span><p><span class="cl">(Mishnah):</span> If one slaughters (a Korban) and is Ma'aleh (offers on a Bamah) b'Chutz (outside the Mikdash), he is liable for both of these;</p></div>
<div class="indent1"><span class="nm">(b)</span><p>R. Yosi ha'Galili says, if he slaughtered inside (the Mikdash) and was Ma'aleh b'Chutz, he is liable for both;</p></div>
<div class="indent2"><span class="nm">1.</span><p>If he slaughtered and was Ma'aleh b'Chutz, he is exempt for Ha'alah, for the Korban was Nifsal (due to Shechutei Chutz).</p></div>
<div class="indent1"><span class="nm">(c)</span><p><span class="cl">Chachamim:</span> Even if he slaughtered inside and was Ma'aleh outside, it was Nifsal once it left the Azarah (yet you agree that he is liable for both in this case)!</p></div>
<div class="indent1"><span class="nm">(d)</span><p>If a Tamei (person) ate Kodesh, whether the Kodesh was Tahor or Tamei, he is liable;</p></div>
<div class="indent1"><span class="nm">(e)</span><p>R. Yosi ha'Galili says, if he ate Tahor Kodesh, he is liable;</p></div>
<div class="indent2"><span class="nm">1.</span><p>If he ate Tamei Kodesh he is exempt, for he ate something Pasul.</p></div>
<div class="indent1"><span class="nm">(f)</span><p><span class="cl">Chachamim:</span> Even a Tamei who ate Tahor Kodesh (in a normal way) was Metamei it through touching it (yet you agree that he is liable in this case)!</p></div>
<div class="indent1"><span class="nm">(g)</span><p>If a Tahor ate Tamei Kodesh he is exempt. Kares is only for a Tamei who ate.</p></div>
<div class="subject"><span class="nm">3)</span><p>THE <i>AZHARA</i>H FOR <i>SHECHUTEI CHUTZ</i></p></div>
<div class="indent1"><span class="nm">(a)</span><p><span class="cl">(Gemara) Question:</span> We understand why one is liable (Rashi - a Korban; Tosfos - lashes, as another Mishnah teaches) for Ha'alas Chutz. The Torah wrote the Onesh (punishment, i.e. Kares, if Mezid) and an Azharah (Lav);</p></div>
<div class="indent2"><span class="nm">1.</span><p>"V'El Pesach Ohel Mo'ed Lo Hevi'o (...v'Nichras)" teaches the Onesh. "Hishamer Lecha Pen Ta'aleh Olasecha (b'Chol Makom)" is the Azharah (Lav that forbids it);</p></div>
<div class="indent2"><span class="nm">2.</span><p><span class="cl">(R. Avin):</span> Wherever it says 'Hishamer', 'Pen' or 'Al', this is a Lav.</p></div>
<div class="indent2"><span class="nm">3.</span><p>The Onesh for Shechutei Chutz is explicit - "v'El Pesach Ohel Mo'ed Lo Hevi'o (...v'Nichras)";</p></div>
<div class="indent2"><span class="nm">4.</span><p>However, what is the Azharah for Shechutei Chutz?</p></div>
<div class="indent1"><span class="nm">(b)</span><p><span class="cl">Answer #1:</span> It is "v'Lo Yizbechu Od" (other answers will be given later.)</p></div>
<div class="indent1"><span class="nm">(c)</span><p><span class="cl">Question:</span> This verse is needed for R. Elazar's law!</p></div>
<div class="indent2"><span class="nm">1.</span><p><span class="cl">Question (R. Elazar):</span> What is the source that one is Chayav Misah for slaughtering an animal to Markulis (an idolatry normally served by throwing rocks at it, which is disgraceful)?</p></div>
<div class="indent2"><span class="nm">2.</span><p><span class="cl">Answer (R. Elazar):</span> It is "v'Lo Yizbechu Od Es Zivcheihem (la'Se'irim...)";</p></div>
<div class="indent3"><span class="nm">i.</span><p>Since we do not need it to teach about the normal Avodah of Markulis, which we learn from "Eichah Ya'avdu...Es Eloheihem", we use it to teach about Avodas Panim that is not its normal Avodah.</p></div>
<div class="indent1"><span class="nm">(d)</span><p><span class="cl">Answer (Rabah):</span> We read the verse as if it said 'v'Lo Yizbechu <i>v'Lo</i> Od', to teach both of these.</p></div>
<div class="indent1"><span class="nm">(e)</span><p><span class="cl">Question:</span> We use the verse for a third law!</p></div>
<div class="indent2"><span class="nm">1.</span><p><span class="cl">(Beraisa):</span> The Parshah of Shechutei Chutz first discusses Korbanos Hukdeshu <i>and</i> slaughtered (outside) when one may not offer on a Bamah (e.g. after the Mishkan was built);</p></div>
<div class="bbbline">106b----------------------------------------106b</p></div>
<div class="indent3"><span class="nm">i.</span><p>The Onesh is "v'El Pesach Ohel Mo'ed Lo Hevi'o (...v'Nichras)." The Azharah is "Hishamer Lecha Pen Ta'aleh Olasecha."</p></div>
<div class="indent2"><span class="nm">2.</span><p>"Lema'an Asher Yavi'u... Zivcheihem Asher Hem Zovchim" discusses Korbanos that once were permitted (when they were Hukdeshu) to be offered on a Bamah, but now Bamos are forbidden (they must be brought to the Mishkan);</p></div>
<div class="indent2"><span class="nm">3.</span><p>"Al Penei ha'Sadeh" - Shechitah on a Bamah (when this is forbidden) is like Shechitah Lo l'Shem Shamayim;</p></div>
<div class="indent2"><span class="nm">4.</span><p>"Ve'Hevi'um la'Shem" is an Aseh.</p></div>
<div class="indent2"><span class="nm">5.</span><p><span class="cl">Question:</span> What is the Lav?</p></div>
<div class="indent2"><span class="nm">6.</span><p><span class="cl">Answer:</span> It is "v'Lo Yizbechu Od".</p></div>
<div class="indent3"><span class="nm">i.</span><p><span class="cl">Suggestion:</span> Perhaps one is Chayav Kares!</p></div>
<div class="indent3"><span class="nm">ii.</span><p><span class="cl">Rejection:</span> "Chukas Olam Tihyeh <i>Zos</i> Lahem" - this is the Onesh (a Lav and Aseh), but not Kares.</p></div>
<div class="subject"><span class="nm">4)</span><p>CAN A <i>KAL VA'CHOMER</i> TEACH THE <i>AZHARAH</i>?</p></div>
<div class="indent1"><span class="nm">(a)</span><p><span class="cl">Answer #2 (to Question (2:a) - Abaye):</span> We learn the Azharah from a Kal va'Chomer:</p></div>
<div class="indent2"><span class="nm">1.</span><p>The Torah was Mazhir (forbade with a Lav) even where there is no Kares (Korbanos made Hekdesh when Bamos were permitted). All the more so it is Mazhir where there is Kares (Korbanos made Hekdesh when Bamos were forbidden)!</p></div>
<div class="indent1"><span class="nm">(b)</span><p><span class="cl">Question (Ravina):</span> According to this, the Torah did not need to write a Lav forbidding Chelev. We could have learned from a Kal va'Chomer from Neveilah!</p></div>
<div class="indent2"><span class="nm">1.</span><p>A Lav forbids Neveilah, even though there is no Kares. All the more so a Lav forbids Chelev, which has (an Onesh of) Kares!</p></div>
<div class="indent1"><span class="nm">(c)</span><p><span class="cl">Answer #1 (Rava):</span> No, that Kal va'Chomer can be refuted. Neveilah is Metamei, but Chelev is not.</p></div>
<div class="indent1"><span class="nm">(d)</span><p><span class="cl">Question:</span> We could have learned (a Lav for Chelev from a Kal va'Chomer) from Tamei Sheratzim. A Lav forbids them, even though there is no Kares. All the more so a Lav forbids Chelev, which has Kares!</p></div>
<div class="indent1"><span class="nm">(e)</span><p><span class="cl">Answer #1:</span> We cannot learn from Tamei Sheratzim, for Mashehu (any amount of them, i.e. even the size of a lentil, which is less than a k'Zayis) is Metamei, but Chelev is not. (The text of Rashi in Chulin does not say 'b'Mashehu'. The comment in the margin suggests that Rashi here holds that 'b'Mashehu' is an addition of errant scribes.)</p></div>
<div class="indent1"><span class="nm">(f)</span><p><span class="cl">Question:</span> We could have learned from Tahor Sheratzim. They are Chayavei Lavin without Kares. All the more so a Lav forbids Chelev, which has Kares!</p></div>
<div class="indent1"><span class="nm">(g)</span><p><span class="cl">Answer #1:</span> We cannot learn from Tahor Sheratzim, for one is liable for any amount (Tosfos - a full creation of any size, such as an ant; Rashi - even for a small amount, i.e. a lentil's worth) (but one is exempt for less than a k'Zayis of Chelev).</p></div>
<div class="indent1"><span class="nm">(h)</span><p><span class="cl">Question:</span> We could have learned (like above) from Orlah or Kilai ha'Kerem!</p></div>
<div class="indent1"><span class="nm">(i)</span><p><span class="cl">Answer #1:</span> We cannot learn from Orlah or Kilai ha'Kerem, for one may not benefit from them (but one may benefit from Chelev.)</p></div>
<div class="indent1"><span class="nm">(j)</span><p><span class="cl">Question:</span> We could have learned from Shemitah produce!</p></div>
<div class="indent1"><span class="nm">(k)</span><p><span class="cl">Answer #1:</span> We cannot learn from Shemitah, for it forbids anything exchanged for it.</p></div>
<div class="indent1"><span class="nm">(l)</span><p><span class="cl">Question:</span> We could have learned from Terumah!</p></div>
<div class="indent1"><span class="nm">(m)</span><p><span class="cl">Answer:</span> We cannot learn from Terumah, for it is never wholly permitted (but Chelev of Chayos is totally permitted).</p></div>
<div class="indent1"><span class="nm">(n)</span><p><span class="cl">Answer #2 (to Questions (b), (d), (f), (h) and (j)):</span> We cannot learn from those sources, for they are never wholly permitted.</p></div>
<div class="indent1"><span class="nm">(o)</span><p><span class="cl">Question (Rava - Mishnah):</span> There is no Korban for (failure to fulfill) Pesach or circumcision, for they are Mitzvos Aseh.</p></div>
<div class="indent2"><span class="nm">1.</span><p>We should learn a Kal va'Chomer from Mosir (not eating Korbanos within the allotted time). A Lav forbids Mosir, even though there is no Kares, all the more so a Lav forbids (neglect of) Pesach and Milah!</p></div>
<div class="indent1"><span class="nm">(p)</span><p><span class="cl">Answer (Rav Kahana):</span> We cannot learn from Mosir, for the transgression cannot be fixed, but one who did not fulfill Pesach can fix this by bringing Pesach Sheni! (Tzon Kodoshim - likewise, one who delayed Milah can circumcise himself later.)</p></div>
<div class="indent1"><span class="nm">(q)</span><p>Objection (to answer (a)) Can we really derive an Azharah from a Kal va'Chomer?!</p></div>
<div class="indent2"><span class="nm">1.</span><p>Even according to the opinion that we punish due to a Kal va'Chomer, we cannot derive an Azharah from a Kal va'Chomer!</p></div>
