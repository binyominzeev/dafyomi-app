<p class="bas indent1"><span class="nm">(a)</span>The Romans asked the rulers of Beis Pe'or to show them Moshe's burial site. When they stood on the high place, it appeared to be below. When they stood below, it appeared to be above.</p>
<p class="bas indent2"><span class="nm">1.</span>They split into two groups. To the ones above, it seemed to be below; to the ones below, it seemed to be above.</p>
<p class="bas indent2"><span class="nm">2.</span>This fulfilled "no man knew the place of his burial."</p>
<p class="bas indent1"><span class="nm">(b)</span><span class="cl">(R. Chama b'Rebbi Chanina):</span> Even Moshe does not know the place of his burial - it says, "no man knew...", and Moshe is called "the man of Hash-m." (Meshech Chachmah Devarim 34:6 - Moshe was so far from physicality, that he was a stranger to burial.)</p>
<p class="bas indent1"><span class="nm">(c)</span><span class="cl">Question (R. Chama b'Rebbi Chanina):</span> Why was Moshe buried by Beis Pe'or?</p>
<p class="bas indent1"><span class="nm">(d)</span><span class="cl">Answer (R. Chama):</span> This was to atone for Yisrael's sin with Pe'or.</p>
<p class="bas indent1"><span class="nm">(e)</span><span class="cl">Question (R. Chama):</span> How can one fulfill "you will go after Hash-m"? "Hash-m is a consuming fire"!</p>
<p class="bas indent1"><span class="nm">(f)</span><span class="cl">Answer (R. Chama b'Rebbi Chanina):</span> You go in Hash-m's ways;</p>
<p class="bas indent2"><span class="nm">1.</span>Hash-m clothes the naked - "Hash-m made for Adam and his wife tunics of skin and clothed them." Also you should clothe the naked!</p>
<p class="bas indent2"><span class="nm">2.</span>Hash-m visits the sick - "Hash-m appeared to him (Avraham) in Elonei Mamre." Also you should do so!</p>
<p class="bas indent2"><span class="nm">3.</span>Hash-m consoles mourners - "after Avraham died, Hash-m blessed Yitzchak." Also you should do so!</p>
<p class="bas indent2"><span class="nm">4.</span>Hash-m buries the dead - "He buried him in the valley." Also you should do so!</p>
<p class="bas indent1"><span class="nm">(g)</span><span class="cl">(Rav or Shmuel):</span> They are called "tunics of skin" because they are made from skin;</p>
<p class="bas indent1"><span class="nm">(h)</span><span class="cl">(The other of Rav and Shmuel):</span> They are called so because the skin benefits from them.</p>
<p class="bas indent1"><span class="nm">(i)</span><span class="cl">(R. Simlai):</span> The beginning and end of Torah is bestowing Chesed.</p>
<p class="bas indent2"><span class="nm">1.</span>The beginning - "Hash-m made for Adam and his wife tunics of skin and clothed them";</p>
<p class="bas indent2"><span class="nm">2.</span>The end - "He buried him in the valley."</p>
<p class="bas indent1"><span class="nm">(j)</span><span class="cl">Rhetorical question (R. Simlai):</span> Why did Moshe want to enter Eretz Yisrael. Was it to eat the fruit, or to be satiated from its bounty?!</p>
<p class="bas indent1"><span class="nm">(k)</span><span class="cl">Answer:</span> Rather, he wanted to fulfill the many Mitzvos that apply only in Eretz Yisrael.</p>
<p class="bas indent1"><span class="nm">(l)</span><span class="cl">Hash-m:</span> You want to receive the reward. I credit you as if you fulfilled them!</p>
<p class="bas indent1"><span class="nm">(m)</span><span class="cl">Suggestion:</span> "Therefore I apportion to him among the great" - perhaps his portion is among the later Tzadikim, but not like the early ones.</p>
<p class="bas indent1"><span class="nm">(n)</span><span class="cl">Rejection:</span> "And with the awesome he will share the spoils" - with Avraham, Yitzchak and Yakov, who were awesome in Torah and Mitzvos.</p>
<p class="bas indent1"><span class="nm">(o)</span>"Since he poured out his soul to die" - he gave himself over to die - "if not (You will not forgive them), blot me out."</p>
<p class="bas indent1"><span class="nm">(p)</span>"With sinners he is counted" - he is counted among those who died in the wilderness.</p>
<p class="bas indent1"><span class="nm">(q)</span>"He bore the sin of the many" - he atoned for the sin of the golden calf.</p>
<p class="bas indent1"><span class="nm">(r)</span>"For the sinners he was Mafgi'a" - he requested mercy for the sinners of Yisrael, that they should repent;</p>
<p class="bas indent2"><span class="nm">1.</span>Mafgi'a refers to prayer - "do not pray for the nation... and do not be Tifga to Me."</p>

<p class="bas subject"><span class="nm">2)</span>THE OFFERING OF A <i>SOTAH</i></p>
<p class="bas indent1"><span class="nm">(a)</span><span class="cl">(Mishnah):</span> Her husband would bring her Minchah in a Mitzri basket (made of shoots that grow around a palm tree). He (the Kohen) puts it in her hands, to weary her.</p>
<p class="bas indent1"><span class="nm">(b)</span>All other Menachos (flour-offerings) are in a Kli Shares (a Kodesh Kli used for the Avodah) from the beginning until the end. This one starts in a Mitzri basket and ends in a Kli Shares;</p>
<p class="bas indent1"><span class="nm">(c)</span>All other Menachos require oil and frankincense. This one requires neither;</p>
<p class="bas indent1"><span class="nm">(d)</span>All other Menachos are from wheat. This one is from barley;</p>
<p class="bas indent2"><span class="nm">1.</span>Minchas ha'Omer (brought on the second day of Pesach), even though it is from barley, is from choice barley and is thoroughly sifted. This is from (unsifted) flour.</p>
<p class="bas indent1"><span class="nm">(e)</span>R. Gamliel says, just like her actions were like those of an animal, also her offering is animal food.</p>
<p class="bas indent1"><span class="nm">(f)</span><span class="cl">(Gemara - Beraisa - Aba Chanan):</span> The Minchah is put in her hands to weary her, so she will confess.</p>
<p class="bas indent2"><span class="nm">1.</span>The Torah is so concerned for sinners, and all the more so, for those who do Hash-m's will!</p>
<p class="bas indent1"><span class="nm">(g)</span><span class="cl">Question:</span> What is the source that the Torah is concerned for her? Perhaps the concern is that Hash-m's name not be erased!</p>
<p class="bas bbbline">14b----------------------------------------14b</p>
<p class="bas indent1"><span class="nm">(h)</span><span class="cl">Answer:</span> He holds that she drinks before offering the Korban.</p>
<p class="bas indent2"><span class="nm">1.</span>If the concern was to avoid erasing Hash-m's name, we would not weary her after it was erased!</p>
<p class="bas indent1"><span class="nm">(i)</span><span class="cl">(Mishnah):</span> All Menachos (are in a Kli Shares from the beginning until the end).</p>
<p class="bas indent1"><span class="nm">(j)</span><span class="cl">Contradiction (Beraisa):</span> The procedure of a Minchah: a man brings it from his house in a silver or gold basket, and puts it in a Kli Shares, and is Mekadesh it in a Kli Shares;</p>
<p class="bas indent2"><span class="nm">1.</span>He puts its oil and frankincense on it, and brings it to the Kohen. The Kohen takes it to the Mizbe'ach, and brings it close to the southwest corner, at the edge. This suffices.</p>
<p class="bas indent2"><span class="nm">2.</span>He removes the frankincense to one side, and takes a Kometz (the amount that fits in his three middle fingers when bent into his palm) from a place where the oil was absorbed well. He puts the Kometz in a Kli Shares, and is Mekadesh it in a Kli Shares;</p>
<p class="bas indent2"><span class="nm">3.</span>He takes the frankincense and puts it on the Kometz. He takes it up and burns it in a Kli Shares (this will be explained). He salts it and puts it on the fire;</p>
<p class="bas indent2"><span class="nm">4.</span>After the Kometz is offered, the remainder of the Minchah may be eaten. The Kohanim may mix it with wine, oil, and honey. The only Isur is to ferment it (make it Chametz).</p>
<p class="bas indent2"><span class="nm">5.</span>The Beraisa says that one takes a Minchah from his house in a silver or gold basket (which is not a Kli Shares)!</p>
<p class="bas indent1"><span class="nm">(k)</span><span class="cl">Answer (Rav Papa):</span> The Mishnah means that other Menachos begin in a Kli that could be a Kli Shares.</p>
<p class="bas indent1"><span class="nm">(l)</span><span class="cl">Inference:</span> A Mitzri basket cannot be a Kli Shares.</p>
<p class="bas indent1"><span class="nm">(m)</span><span class="cl">Suggestion:</span> The Mishnah is unlike R. Yosi b'Rebbi Yehudah:</p>
<p class="bas indent2"><span class="nm">1.</span><span class="cl">(Rebbi):</span> A Kli Shares made of wood is invalid;</p>
<p class="bas indent2"><span class="nm">2.</span>R. Yosi b'Rebbi Yehudah permits this.</p>
<p class="bas indent1"><span class="nm">(n)</span><span class="cl">Rejection:</span> The Mishnah is even like R. Yosi b'Rebbi Yehudah. He allows wooden Kelim only of quality.</p>
<p class="bas indent2"><span class="nm">1.</span>R. Yosi b'Rebbi Yehudah surely agrees to "offer this to your governor" (something that one could not offer to an official may not be offered to Hash-m)!</p>
<p class="bas subject"><span class="nm">3)</span>OTHER <i>MENACHOS</i></p>
<p class="bas indent1"><span class="nm">(a)</span><span class="cl">(Beraisa):</span> He puts it in a Kli Shares, and is Mekadesh it in a Kli Shares.</p>
<p class="bas indent2"><span class="nm">1.</span><span class="cl">Suggestion:</span> This teaches that a Kli Shares is Mekadesh its contents only if they were put in it with that intention.</p>
<p class="bas indent2"><span class="nm">2.</span><span class="cl">Rejection:</span> No. The Beraisa means, he puts it a Kli Shares, and it (automatically) becomes Mekudash in the Kli Shares.</p>
<p class="bas indent1"><span class="nm">(b)</span><span class="cl">(Beraisa):</span> He puts its oil and frankincense on it and brings it to the Kohen. The Kohen takes it to the Mizbe'ach.</p>
<p class="bas indent2"><span class="nm">1.</span>The Torah explicitly says so.</p>
<p class="bas indent1"><span class="nm">(c)</span><span class="cl">(Beraisa):</span> He brings it close to the southwest corner, at the edge; this suffices.</p>
<p class="bas indent1"><span class="nm">(d)</span><span class="cl">Question:</span> What is the source for this?</p>
<p class="bas indent1"><span class="nm">(e)</span><span class="cl">Answer:</span> "... The Kohanim will offer it in front of Hash-m, to the face of the Mizbe'ach."</p>
<p class="bas indent2"><span class="nm">1.</span><span class="cl">(Beraisa) Suggestion:</span> Perhaps "in front of Hash-m" teaches that he brings it to the west side! (The Heichal is 30 Amos wide, exactly facing the 30 Amos between the corners on the west side of the Mizbe'ach.)</p>
<p class="bas indent2"><span class="nm">2.</span><span class="cl">Rejection:</span> It says "El Pnei ha'Mizbe'ach." (The Yerech (thigh) is the north, so the Panim (face) is the south.)</p>
<p class="bas indent2"><span class="nm">3.</span><span class="cl">Suggestion:</span> Perhaps "El Pnei ha'Mizbe'ach" teaches that he brings it to the south!</p>
<p class="bas indent2"><span class="nm">4.</span><span class="cl">Rejection:</span> It says "in front of Hash-m";</p>
<p class="bas indent3"><span class="nm">i.</span><span class="cl">Resolution:</span> He brings it close to the southwest corner, at the edge. This suffices;</p>
<p class="bas indent2"><span class="nm">5.</span><span class="cl">Suggestion (R. Elazar):</span> Perhaps he may bring it to the west side of the corner, or to the south side of the corner!</p>
<p class="bas indent2"><span class="nm">6.</span><span class="cl">Rejection:</span> If there are two verses, and if we fulfill the first, we can also fulfill the second; but fulfilling the second will not allow fulfilling the first, we fulfill the first, so we can fulfill both;</p>
<p class="bas indent3"><span class="nm">i.</span>If we fulfill "in front of Hash-m" in the west, we neglect "El Pnei ha'Mizbe'ach";</p>
<p class="bas indent3"><span class="nm">ii.</span>We can fulfill "El Pnei ha'Mizbe'ach" in the south, and also "in front of Hash-m";</p>
<p class="bas indent3"><span class="nm">iii.</span>We do so by bringing it to the south side of the corner.</p>
<p class="bas indent2"><span class="nm">7.</span><span class="cl">Question:</span> How does this fulfill "in front of Hash-m"?</p>
<p class="bas indent2"><span class="nm">8.</span><span class="cl">Answer (Rav Ashi):</span> R. Elazar holds that the entire Mizbe'ach is in the north (so south of it faces the Heichal).</p>
<p class="bas indent1"><span class="nm">(f)</span><span class="cl">Question:</span> Why does the Beraisa say 'this suffices'?</p>
<p class="bas indent1"><span class="nm">(g)</span><span class="cl">Answer (Rav Ashi):</span> One might have thought that one must tilt the Kli to make the Minchah itself touch the Mizbe'ach. 'This suffices' teaches that this is not so.</p>
<p class="bas indent2"><span class="nm">1.</span><span class="cl">Suggestion:</span> Perhaps this is required!</p>
<p class="bas indent2"><span class="nm">2.</span><span class="cl">Rejection:</span> "He will bring it to the Kohen... he will bring it near the Mizbe'ach." Just like it is brought to the Kohen in a Kli, also it is brought near the Mizbe'ach in a Kli.</p>
<p class="bas indent1"><span class="nm">(h)</span><span class="cl">(Beraisa):</span> He removes the frankincense to one side.</p>
<p class="bas indent1"><span class="nm">(i)</span>This is so the Kometz will not include any frankincense.</p>
<p class="bas indent2"><span class="nm">1.</span><span class="cl">(Mishnah):</span> If he took a Kometz, and it included a pebble or grain of sand or a drop of frankincense, the Kometz is invalid.</p>
<p class="bas indent1"><span class="nm">(j)</span><span class="cl">(Beraisa):</span> He takes a Kometz from a place where the oil was absorbed well.</p>
<p class="bas indent1"><span class="nm">(k)</span>We learn from "from its fine flour and its oil", and "from its fine barley-flour and its oil."</p>
<p class="bas indent1"><span class="nm">(l)</span><span class="cl">(Beraisa):</span> He puts the Kometz in a Kli Shares, and is Mekadesh it in a Kli Shares.</p>
<p class="bas indent1"><span class="nm">(m)</span><span class="cl">Question:</span> Why must he Mekadesh it? He was already Mekadesh it (and the entire Minchah)!</p>
<p class="bas indent1"><span class="nm">(n)</span><span class="cl">Answer:</span> A second Kidush is required, like we find regarding blood.</p>
<p class="bas indent2"><span class="nm">1.</span>Even though the knife was Mekadesh the blood at the time of slaughter, one is Mekadesh the blood again by putting it in a Kli Shares. The same applies to the Kometz.</p>
<p class="bas indent1"><span class="nm">(o)</span><span class="cl">(Beraisa):</span> He takes the frankincense and puts it on the Kometz.</p>
<p class="bas indent2"><span class="nm">1.</span>We learn from "and all the frankincense on the Minchah."</p>
