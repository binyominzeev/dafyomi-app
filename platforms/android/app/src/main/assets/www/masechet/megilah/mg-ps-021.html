<div class="subject"><span class="nm">1)</span><p>MITZVOS THAT MAY BE DONE ANY TIME DURING THE NIGHT</p></div>
<div class="indent1"><span class="nm">(a)</span><p><span class="cl">(Mishnah):</span> The whole night is Kosher for reaping the Omer.</p></div>
<div class="indent1"><span class="nm">(b)</span><p>It was taught that reaping the Omer and Sefiras ha'Omer are at night. The Omer is offered during the day.</p></div>
<div class="indent1"><span class="nm">(c)</span><p>We learn about Haktarah of Chelev and limbs from "The entire night until the morning."</p></div>
<div class="indent1"><span class="nm">(d)</span><p><span class="cl">(Mishnah):</span> The rule is, a daytime Mitzvah is Kosher the entire day.</p></div>
<div class="indent1"><span class="nm">(e)</span><p>This comes to include arranging spoons (of frankincense that accompany Lechem ha'Panim) on the Shulchan and removing them. This is like R. Yosi:</p></div>
<div class="indent2"><span class="nm">1.</span><p><span class="cl">(Beraisa - R. Yosi):</span> Even if the old Lechem ha'Panim was removed in the morning and the new Lechem was not arranged until close to evening, it is not a problem.</p></div>
<div class="indent2"><span class="nm">2.</span><p><span class="cl">Question:</span> We require "V'Nosata Al ha'Shulchan Lechem Panim Lefanai <i>Tamid</i>"!</p></div>
<div class="indent2"><span class="nm">3.</span><p><span class="cl">Answer:</span> This forbids leaving the Shulchan without bread overnight.</p></div>
<div class="indent1"><span class="nm">(f)</span><p><span class="cl">(Mishnah):</span> Every nighttime Mitzvah is Kosher the entire night.</p></div>
<div class="indent1"><span class="nm">(g)</span><p>This comes to include eating Korban Pesach. It is unlike R. Elazar ben Azaryah:</p></div>
<div class="indent2"><span class="nm">1.</span><p><span class="cl">(Beraisa -R. Elazar ben Azaryah):</span> A Gezeirah Shavah "ba'Laylah ha'Zeh-ba'Laylah ha'Zeh" to Makos Bechoros teaches that Pesach may be eaten only until midnight.</p></div>
<div class="perekline">PEREK HA'KOREI ES HA'MEGILAH</div>
<div class="subject"><span class="nm">2)</span><p>MISHNAH: WE STAND FOR KERI'AS HA'TORAH</p></div>
<div class="indent1"><span class="nm">(a)</span><p><span class="cl">(Mishnah):</span> One may stand or sit while reading the Megilah.</p></div>
<div class="indent1"><span class="nm">(b)</span><p>One is Yotzei whether one or two read it.</p></div>
<div class="indent1"><span class="nm">(c)</span><p>One needs to bless on it only where that is the custom.</p></div>
<div class="indent1"><span class="nm">(d)</span><p>On Monday, Thursday, and Shabbos afternoon, exactly three read from the Torah. There is no Haftorah;</p></div>
<div class="indent1"><span class="nm">(e)</span><p>On Rosh Chodesh and Chol ha'Moed exactly four read; there is no Haftorah.</p></div>
<div class="indent2"><span class="nm">1.</span><p>The ones who read first and last bless before and after reading, respectively.</p></div>
<div class="indent1"><span class="nm">(f)</span><p>This is the general rule. Any day with Musaf, and it is not Yom Tov, four read;</p></div>
<div class="indent1"><span class="nm">(g)</span><p>On Yom Tov five read; others may be added. There is a Haftorah;</p></div>
<div class="indent1"><span class="nm">(h)</span><p>On Yom Kipur at least six read, and a Haftorah;</p></div>
<div class="indent1"><span class="nm">(i)</span><p>On Shabbos at least seven read, and a Haftorah.</p></div>
<div class="indent2"><span class="nm">1.</span><p>The ones who read first and last bless before and after reading, respectively.</p></div>
<div class="indent1"><span class="nm">(j)</span><p><span class="cl">(Gemara - Beraisa):</span> (One may read the Megilah standing or sitting -) this does not apply to Torah (we must stand while reading it b'Tzibur)!</p></div>
<div class="indent1"><span class="nm">(k)</span><p><span class="cl">(R. Avahu):</span> We learn from "Stand here with me". Had the Torah not written this, it would be forbidden to say this. It was as if also Hash-m stood!</p></div>
<div class="indent1"><span class="nm">(l)</span><p>This also teaches that the Rebbi should not sit on a bed while teaching Talmidim sitting on the ground (rather, they should be equal).</p></div>
<div class="indent1"><span class="nm">(m)</span><p><span class="cl">(Beraisa):</span> From the days of Moshe until R. Gamliel, people stood while learning Torah. After R. Gamliel died, people became weak, and people learned while sitting. (Yehoshua used to arrange the benches where Moshe taught (Bamidbar Rabah 21:14). Perhaps we can explain that people sat while reviewing, or when learning harsh matters, like Rav or Rava below);</p></div>
<div class="indent2"><span class="nm">1.</span><p><span class="cl">(Mishnah):</span> The honor of Torah ceased when R. Gamliel died.</p></div>
<div class="indent1"><span class="nm">(n)</span><p><span class="cl">Contradiction:</span> It says, "Va'Eshev (I sat) on the mountain", and it says, "I stood on the mountain"!</p></div>
<div class="indent1"><span class="nm">(o)</span><p><span class="cl">Resolution #1 (Rav):</span> Moshe learned while standing, and reviewed his learning while sitting.</p></div>
<div class="indent1"><span class="nm">(p)</span><p><span class="cl">Resolution #2 (R. Chanina):</span> Moshe neither sat nor stood. Rather, he was bent over.</p></div>
<div class="indent1"><span class="nm">(q)</span><p><span class="cl">Resolution #3 (R. Yochanan):</span> "Va'Eshev" does not mean 'I sat', rather, 'I delayed'.</p></div>
<div class="indent1"><span class="nm">(r)</span><p><span class="cl">Resolution #4 (Rava):</span> He learned gentle matters while standing, and harsh matters while sitting.</p></div>

<div class="subject"><span class="nm">3)</span><p>READING SIMULTANEOUSLY</p></div>
<div class="indent1"><span class="nm">(a)</span><p><span class="cl">(Beraisa):</span> One person reads the Torah, and one translates. Two may not (simultaneously) translate (or read, for they will not be heard);</p></div>
<div class="indent2"><span class="nm">1.</span><p>One person reads from the Nevi'im, and two may translate. (We are not so concerned that it be heard, since Nevi'im do not teach Halachos).</p></div>
<div class="indent1"><span class="nm">(b)</span><p>Ten people may read (or translate - Rashi deletes this from the text) Hallel or the Megilah at the same time.</p></div>
<div class="indent2"><span class="nm">1.</span><p><span class="cl">Question:</span> Why are these different?</p></div>
<div class="indent2"><span class="nm">2.</span><p><span class="cl">Answer:</span> Since they are dear to people, they concentrate and can hear.</p></div>
<div class="indent1"><span class="nm">(c)</span><p><span class="cl">(Mishnah):</span> Where the custom is to bless, one blesses.</p></div>
<div class="indent1"><span class="nm">(d)</span><p><span class="cl">(Abaye):</span> This refers to the Berachah after reading; before, it is a Mitzvah to bless;</p></div>
<div class="indent2"><span class="nm">1.</span><p><span class="cl">(Rav Yehudah):</span> One blesses Over (before) performing any Mitzvah.</p></div>
<div class="indent2"><span class="nm">2.</span><p><span class="cl">Question:</span> How do we know that 'Over' means before?</p></div>
<div class="indent2"><span class="nm">3.</span><p><span class="cl">Answer #1 (Rav Nachman bar Yitzchak):</span> "Va'Yaratz Achima'atz va'Ya'avor Es ha'Kushi".</p></div>
<div class="indent2"><span class="nm">4.</span><p><span class="cl">Answer #2 (Abaye):</span> "V'Hu Avar Lifneihem".</p></div>
<div class="indent2"><span class="nm">5.</span><p><span class="cl">Answer #3:</span> "Va'Ya'avor Malkam Lifneihem va'Shem b'Rosham".</p></div>
<div class="indent1"><span class="nm">(e)</span><p><span class="cl">Question:</span> What Berachos are made?</p></div>
<div class="indent1"><span class="nm">(f)</span><p><span class="cl">Answer:</span> Rav Sheshes blessed 'Mem-Nun-Ches' (Al Mikra <i>M</i>egilah, she'Asah <i>N</i>isim and Shehe'<i>Ch</i>eyanu) before reading.</p></div>
<div class="indent1"><span class="nm">(g)</span><p>After reading, we bless 'the One who wages our conflict, judges our case, takes our vengeance, .... and repays all our enemies. Baruch Atah Hash-m, who pays up Yisrael from all their enemies.'</p></div>
<div class="indent1"><span class="nm">(h)</span><p><span class="cl">(Rava):</span> We end 'ha'Kel ha'Moshi'a.'</p></div>
<div class="indent1"><span class="nm">(i)</span><p><span class="cl">(Rav Papa):</span> We do not favor one opinion over the other; rather, we say both.</p></div>
<div class="indent1"><span class="nm">(j)</span><p><span class="cl">(Mishnah):</span> On Monday, Thursday and Shabbos afternoon three people read.</p></div>
<div class="indent1"><span class="nm">(k)</span><p><span class="cl">Question:</span> To what do these three correspond?</p></div>
<div class="indent1"><span class="nm">(l)</span><p><span class="cl">Answer #1 (Rava):</span> They correspond to Kohanim, Leviyim and Yisraelim.</p></div>
<div class="indent1"><span class="nm">(m)</span><p><span class="cl">Question:</span> Rav Simi taught that we do not read less than 10 verses. To what do they correspond?</p></div>
<div class="indent1"><span class="nm">(n)</span><p><span class="cl">Answer #1 (R. Yehoshua ben Levi):</span> They correspond to 10 Batlanim (people that do not work and are always in the Beis ha'Keneses).</p></div>
<div class="indent1"><span class="nm">(o)</span><p><span class="cl">Answer #2 (Rav Yosef):</span> They correspond to Aseres ha'Dibros.</p></div>
<div class="indent1"><span class="nm">(p)</span><p><span class="cl">Answer #3 (R. Levi):</span> They correspond to the 10 Hilulim (praises) in Psalms.</p></div>
<div class="indent1"><span class="nm">(q)</span><p><span class="cl">Answer #4 (R. Yochanan):</span> They correspond to the 10 declarations of creation.</p></div>
<div class="indent2"><span class="nm">1.</span><p><span class="cl">Question:</span> It says "Va'Yomer Hash-m" only nine times!</p></div>
<div class="indent2"><span class="nm">2.</span><p><span class="cl">Answer:</span> "Bereishis" is also a declaration.</p></div>
<div class="indent1"><span class="nm">(r)</span><p><span class="cl">(Rava):</span> Whichever of the three people reads four verses is praised (more than the others who read three each).</p></div>
<div class="indent2"><span class="nm">1.</span><p>We find a preference for the first regarding the three boxes of Shekalim of Terumas ha'Lishkah. They are labeled so we will know which is first, for the Mitzvah is to buy Korbanos Tzibur from the first box.</p></div>
<div class="indent2"><span class="nm">2.</span><p>We find a preference for the middle regarding the branches of the Menorah:</p></div>
<div class="indent3"><span class="nm">i.</span><p><span class="cl">(Beraisa):</span> "El Mul Penei ha'Menorah Ya'iru Shiv'as ha'Neros" teaches that the six lamps of the branches are tilted towards the Ner Ma'aravi (the middle lamp), and the Ner Ma'aravi is tilted towards the Shechinah (in the west).</p></div>
<div class="indent3"><span class="nm">ii.</span><p><span class="cl">(R. Yochanan):</span> This shows that the middle is preferable.</p></div>
<div class="indent2"><span class="nm">3.</span><p>There is a preference for the last because we ascend in Kedushah, and do not descend.</p></div>
<div class="indent2"><span class="nm">4.</span><p>A case occurred in which the first person read four verses, and Rav Papa praised him.</p></div>
<div class="indent1"><span class="nm">(s)</span><p><span class="cl">(Mishnah):</span> We may not detract nor increase from the number of people that read.</p></div>
<div class="indent1"><span class="nm">(t)</span><p><span class="cl">(Beraisa):</span> The first person blesses before reading; the last person blesses after reading.</p></div>
<div class="indent1"><span class="nm">(u)</span><p>Nowadays everyone blesses before and after Keri'as ha'Torah. We are afraid lest a person enter (or leave) in the middle, and he will think that we do not bless before (or after).</p></div>
<div class="subject"><span class="nm">4)</span><p>THE KRI'AH ON ROSH CHODESH</p></div>
<div class="indent1"><span class="nm">(a)</span><p><span class="cl">(Mishnah):</span> On Rosh Chodesh and Chol ha'Moed there are four Olim (people called to read).</p></div>
<div class="indent1"><span class="nm">(b)</span><p><span class="cl">Question (Ula bar Rav):</span> How do we split the Kri'ah for Rosh Chodesh among the four?</p></div>
<div class="indent2"><span class="nm">1.</span><p>The first eight verses are a Parshah (a segment of the Torah delineated by spaces. In printed Chumashim a Samech or Pei denotes the end of a Parshah.)</p></div>
<div class="indent2"><span class="nm">2.</span><p>The first two Olim cannot read three verses each, for this would leave two verses in the Parshah, and we do not do this!</p></div>
<div class="indent1"><span class="nm">(c)</span><p><span class="cl">Answer #1:</span> Each will read four.</p></div>
<div class="indent1"><span class="nm">(d)</span><p><span class="cl">Rejection:</span> If so, how will the last two Olim read the remaining seven verses, which consist of a Parshah of two verses and a Parshah of five?</p></div>
<div class="indent2"><span class="nm">1.</span><p>The first (of the last two Olim) cannot read the Parshah of two and one verse from the next Parshah, for we do not begin less than three verses of a Parshah!</p></div>
<div class="indent2"><span class="nm">2.</span><p>If he will read the Parshah of two and three from the next Parshah, only two will remain for the last person!</p></div>
