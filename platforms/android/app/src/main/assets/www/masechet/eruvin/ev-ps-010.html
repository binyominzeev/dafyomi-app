<div class="subject"><span class="nm">1)</span><p>IS NIR'EH MIBA'CHUTZ V'SHAVAH MIBI'FNIM CONSIDERED A LECHI? (cont.)</p></div>
<div class="indent1"><span class="nm">(a)</span><p><span class="cl">Answer:</span> The Beraisa is like Rebbi, who requires two remnants (one on each side of a totally breached wall):</p></div>
<div class="indent2"><span class="nm">1.</span><p><span class="cl">(Beraisa):</span> One remnant permits a Chatzer;</p></div>
<div class="indent2"><span class="nm">2.</span><p>Rebbi says, two remnants permit.</p></div>
<div class="indent1"><span class="nm">(b)</span><p><span class="cl">Question:</span> We understand this if Nir'eh miba'Chutz v'Shavah mibi'Fnim is not considered a Lechi:</p></div>
<div class="indent2"><span class="nm">1.</span><p>Rebbi holds like R. Yosi (who requires a Lechi [and all the more so a remnant] to be at least three Tefachim (14b)). Ravina is wrong (if the small Chatzer is not centered, it is less than three Tefachim from one side, that remnant is too small to permit the big Chatzer) and R. Zeira is wrong. (If the small Chatzer jut into the big Chatzer, since it must be centered, the sides are Lavud, and they would permit the small Chatzer);</p></div>
<div class="indent3"><span class="nm">i.</span><p>The big Chatzer must be an Amah bigger than the small Chatzer [to allow a remnant of three Tefachim on each side].</p></div>
<div class="indent2"><span class="nm">2.</span><p>However, if Nir'eh miba'Chutz v'Shavah mibi'Fnim is considered a Lechi, R. Zeira and Ravina are correct, and Rebbi argues with R. Yosi, why do we establish the big Chatzer to be 11? To permit the big Chatzer, it could exceed 10 by a mere two Tefachim (Tosfos - perhaps any amount)!</p></div>
<div class="indent3"><span class="nm">i.</span><p>If we make it bigger to teach that the small Chatzer is forbidden, we should teach that it is more than 11 [so that this will always be true. When it is 11, it is not true if it is centered, for both sides are Lavud to the walls of the big Chatzer]! (Even when it is more than 11, we must assume that the walls are not overly thick - if not, it is always possible that they are within three on both sides - <b>PF</b>.)</p></div>
<div class="indent1"><span class="nm">(c)</span><p><span class="cl">Conclusion:</span> We must say that Nir'eh miba'Chutz v'Shavah mibi'Fnim is not considered a Lechi.</p></div>
<div class="indent1"><span class="nm">(d)</span><p><span class="cl">Rav Yosef:</span> I never heard this teaching. (Presumably, this was after he forgot his learning.)</p></div>
<div class="indent1"><span class="nm">(e)</span><p><span class="cl">Abaye:</span> You taught it to us, regarding the following teaching!</p></div>
<div class="indent2"><span class="nm">1.</span><p><span class="cl">(Rami bar Aba):</span> If a Lechi is just outside the Mavoy wall and [seemingly] extends the wall:</p></div>
<div class="indent3"><span class="nm">i.</span><p>If it is less than four Amos, it is considered a Lechi, so one may carry until its inner edge;</p></div>
<div class="indent3"><span class="nm">ii.</span><p>If it is four Amos [or more], it is considered a Mavoy, and not a Lechi. One may not carry in the Mavoy.</p></div>
<div class="indent2"><span class="nm">2.</span><p><span class="cl">(Rav Yosef):</span> We learn three things from this:</p></div>
<div class="indent3"><span class="nm">i.</span><p>Bein ha'Lechayayim is forbidden (one may not carry past the inner edge);</p></div>
<div class="indent3"><span class="nm">ii.</span><p>The extent of a Mavoy is four Amos;</p></div>
<div class="indent3"><span class="nm">iii.</span><p>Nir'eh miba'Chutz v'Shavah mibi'Fnim is considered a Lechi.</p></div>
<div class="indent1"><span class="nm">(f)</span><p>The Halachah is, Nir'eh miba'Chutz v'Shavah mibi'Fnim is considered a Lechi.</p></div>
<div class="indent1"><span class="nm">(g)</span><p><span class="cl">Question:</span> Above (b), we refuted this. How can we say that it is the Halachah?!</p></div>
<div class="indent1"><span class="nm">(h)</span><p><span class="cl">Answer:</span> (Tana'im argue about this.) Beraisa #1 (9b) considers it a Lechi.</p></div>
<div class="subject"><span class="nm">2)</span><p>THE MAXIMUM WIDTH OF A MAVOY</p></div>
<div class="indent1"><span class="nm">(a)</span><p><span class="cl">(Mishnah):</span> If [the opening of the Mavoy] is wider than 10 Amos, it must be reduced [through a Mechitzah in the middle];</p></div>
<div class="indent1"><span class="nm">(b)</span><p><span class="cl">(Beraisa):</span> If it is wider than 10 Amos, it must be reduced;</p></div>
<div class="indent1"><span class="nm">(c)</span><p>R. Yehudah says, it need not be reduced.</p></div>
<div class="indent1"><span class="nm">(d)</span><p><span class="cl">Question (Abaye):</span> How wide does R. Yehudah permit?</p></div>
<div class="indent1"><span class="nm">(e)</span><p><span class="cl">Answer #1 (Rav Achi):</span> He permits up to 13 and a third Amos. There is a Kal va'Chomer from Pasei Bira'os (planks surrounding a well, which permit carrying inside - 17b):</p></div>
<div class="indent2"><span class="nm">1.</span><p>Pasei Bira'os permit even if Parutz Merubah Al ha'Omed (there is more empty space than wall), yet they do not permit a gap more than 13 and a third. Parutz Merubah Al ha'Omed [in all four walls together] forbids a Mavoy. All the more so a gap of more than 13 and a third forbids!</p></div>
<div class="indent1"><span class="nm">(f)</span><p><span class="cl">Rejection #1:</span> Just the contrary! Because we are lenient to allow Parutz Merubah Al ha'Omed regarding Pasei Bira'os, we do not allow [a gap of more than] 13 and a third. Since we are stringent to require Omed Merubah Al ha'Parutz for a Mavoy, we can permit more!</p></div>
<div class="indent1"><span class="nm">(g)</span><p><span class="cl">Rejection #2:</span> Regarding Pasei Bira'os, just like we are lenient to allow Parutz Merubah Al ha'Omed, we allow [a gap of] up to 13 and a third. Regarding a Mavoy, we are stringent to require Omed Merubah Al ha'Parutz, and we allow only up to 10 Amos!</p></div>
<div class="subject"><span class="nm">3)</span><p>FIXING A MAVOY THAT IS TOO WIDE</p></div>
<div class="indent1"><span class="nm">(a)</span><p><span class="cl">(Levi - Beraisa):</span> If [the opening of] a Mavoy is 20 Amos wide, it suffices to stick a stick in the middle (less than 10 Amos remains on each side).</p></div>
<div class="indent1"><span class="nm">(b)</span><p><span class="cl">(Levi):</span> The Halachah is not like this Beraisa (the air on both sides of the stick is Mevatel it).</p></div>
<div class="indent1"><span class="nm">(c)</span><p><span class="cl">Question:</span> How can one permit it?</p></div>
<div class="indent1"><span class="nm">(d)</span><p><span class="cl">Answer #1 (Shmuel citing Levi):</span> One erects a plank 10 Tefachim tall and four Amos long, extending [from the middle of the opening] into the Mavoy. (Since it has a Shi'ur Mavoy, it is not Batel.)</p></div>
<div class="bbbline">10b----------------------------------------10b</p></div>
<div class="indent1"><span class="nm">(e)</span><p><span class="cl">Answer #2:</span> We can do like Rav Yehudah [and put planks along the opening]:</p></div>
<div class="indent2"><span class="nm">1.</span><p><span class="cl">(Rav Yehudah):</span> If a Mavoy is 15 Amos wide, one takes a plank three Amos wide and puts it two Amos from a wall (it is more than the air on that side, therefore it is not Batel. Rav Yehudah discusses an opening 15 Amos wide. If the opening is 20, two planks or a thicker plank is required.)</p></div>
<div class="indent1"><span class="nm">(f)</span><p><span class="cl">Question:</span> [In Rav Yehudah's case] why don't we erect two planks, each one and a half Amos wide with two Amos in between! (Tosfos - this would be better, for it looks more like an opening. Rashi - we ask why one must seal off three Amos together. It should suffice to erect two planks like this!)</p></div>
<div class="indent1"><span class="nm">(g)</span><p><span class="cl">Answer #1:</span> We must say that 'Omed Merubah Al ha'Parutz from two sides' (the plank on either side is smaller than the gap, but together they are bigger than it) is not considered Omed [Merubah Al ha'Parutz, i.e. it is invalid]!</p></div>
<div class="indent1"><span class="nm">(h)</span><p><span class="cl">Rejection (and Answer #2):</span> Really, 'Omed Merubah from two sides' is considered Omed. Here is different, because the air from both sides [of the plank away from the wall] is Mevatel it.</p></div>
<div class="indent1"><span class="nm">(i)</span><p><span class="cl">Question:</span> Why don't we erect three planks, each one Amah wide, with an Amah between planks!</p></div>
<div class="indent1"><span class="nm">(j)</span><p><span class="cl">Answer #1:</span> We must say that Omed k'Parutz (Mechitzos that are as wide as the space between them) does not permit!</p></div>
<div class="indent1"><span class="nm">(k)</span><p><span class="cl">Rejection (and Answer #2):</span> Really, Omed k'Parutz permits. Here is different, because the air from both sides [of the plank in the middle] is Mevatel it.</p></div>
<div class="indent1"><span class="nm">(l)</span><p><span class="cl">Question:</span> Why don't we leave an Amah empty from the wall, erect a plank one and a half Amos wide, leave an Amah and erect another plank of one and a half!</p></div>
<div class="indent1"><span class="nm">(m)</span><p><span class="cl">Answer:</span> Indeed, also that permits. Chachamim did not exert one to do so.</p></div>
<div class="indent1"><span class="nm">(n)</span><p><span class="cl">Question:</span> Perhaps people will use the small opening and abandon the large opening! (The latter would no longer be considered the opening of the Mavoy, so its Lechi cannot permit the Mavoy)!</p></div>
<div class="indent1"><span class="nm">(o)</span><p><span class="cl">Answer (Rav Ada bar Masnah):</span> There is a Chazakah [of human nature], that one does not abandon a large opening and use a small opening.</p></div>
<div class="indent1"><span class="nm">(p)</span><p><span class="cl">Question:</span> What is the difference between this and the case of R. Ami and R. Asi? (If part of a side wall of a Mavoy near the opening was broken, and less than four Tefachim of the wall remain [by the opening], it does not permit a Pirtzah of three Tefachim, lest the Pirtzah become the primary opening. This would invalidate the Lechi or Korah in the original opening.)</p></div>
<div class="indent1"><span class="nm">(q)</span><p><span class="cl">Answer:</span> There, the new opening is a shortcut (it is in a different direction). Here, it is not.</p></div>
<div class="subject"><span class="nm">4)</span><p>OMED MERUBAH REGARDING A KLI</p></div>
<div class="indent1"><span class="nm">(a)</span><p><span class="cl">(Beraisa):</span> Hide of Asla (this will be explained) and its hole join to the Shi'ur of a Tefach [to be an Ohel regarding Tum'as Mes].</p></div>
<div class="indent1"><span class="nm">(b)</span><p><span class="cl">Question:</span> What is this?</p></div>
<div class="indent1"><span class="nm">(c)</span><p><span class="cl">Answer (Rabah bar bar Chanah):</span> It is a toilet seat.</p></div>
<div class="indent1"><span class="nm">(d)</span><p><span class="cl">Question:</span> How big can the hole be?</p></div>
<div class="indent1"><span class="nm">(e)</span><p><span class="cl">Answer #1 (Rav Dimi):</span> It can be [up to] two fingers, surrounded by two fingers [of hide] on each side.</p></div>
<div class="indent1"><span class="nm">(f)</span><p><span class="cl">Answer #2 (Ravin):</span> It can be [up to] one finger, surrounded by one and a half fingers on each side.</p></div>
<div class="indent1"><span class="nm">(g)</span><p><span class="cl">Abaye (to Rav Dimi):</span> Do you argue with Ravin?</p></div>
<div class="indent1"><span class="nm">(h)</span><p><span class="cl">Rav Dimi:</span> We do not argue. I discuss pinkies, and he discusses thumbs (a Tefach equals six pinkies, which equals four thumbs.</p></div>
<div class="indent1"><span class="nm">(i)</span><p><span class="cl">Abaye:</span> You do argue! You hold that Omed Merubah from two sides is Omed, and he disagrees! (This is why he requires each side to be bigger than the hole.)</p></div>
<div class="indent2"><span class="nm">1.</span><p>If you did not argue, Ravin should have said that the hole is one and a third fingers (one and a third thumbs equals two pinkies), surrounded by one and a third fingers on each side!</p></div>
<div class="indent1"><span class="nm">(j)</span><p><span class="cl">Rav Dimi:</span> If we argued [and I permit Omed Merubah from two sides], I should have said that the hole is [bigger than each side, e.g.] two and two thirds fingers, surrounded by one and two thirds fingers on each side!</p></div>
<div class="indent1"><span class="nm">(k)</span><p><span class="cl">Rav Dimi:</span> Rather, you can say that we argue about Parutz k'Omed (from one side. I permit, and he forbids.)</p></div>
