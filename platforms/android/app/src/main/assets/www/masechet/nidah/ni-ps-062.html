<p class="bas subject"><span class="nm">1)</span>REMOVING <i>KESAMIM</i></p>
<p class="bas indent1"><span class="nm">(a)</span><span class="cl">(Mishnah):</span> We pass seven ingredients over a Kesem -- Tefel (tasteless) spit, Mei Grisim, urine, nitre, Boris, Kemunia and Ashleg. (Most of these will be explained. Nowadays the law of our Mishnah does not apply, because we are not certain of the identity of some ingredients - Shulchan Aruch.)</p>
<p class="bas indent1"><span class="nm">(b)</span>(One who wears or moves a garment with Dam Nidah becomes Tamei.) If one immersed a garment with a Kesem (and touched or wore the garment and touched Taharos), and then applied the ingredients and the Kesem persisted, it is (not blood, rather,) dye. The Taharos are Tehorim, and the garment need not be immersed again. (Rashi (Sanhedrin 49b) - it is Vadai not blood. She is permitted to her husband. Tosfos - perhaps it is dye. Rambam -- she is permitted to her husband unless we see that it is blood (the next clause).)</p>
<p class="bas indent2"><span class="nm">1.</span>If the ingredients caused the Kesem to pass or change, it is a (proper) Kesem. The Taharos are Teme'im, the garment must be immersed again.</p>
<p class="bas indent1"><span class="nm">(c)</span>Spit is Tefel if the person did not taste anything (all day);</p>
<p class="bas indent1"><span class="nm">(d)</span>Mei Grisim is chewed shelled beans (Rambam - they are mixed with saliva; Aruch - one pours water over them).</p>
<p class="bas indent1"><span class="nm">(e)</span>The urine must be putrefied.</p>
<p class="bas indent1"><span class="nm">(f)</span>Each ingredient must be rubbed three times (on the Kesem);</p>
<p class="bas indent2"><span class="nm">1.</span>If one applied the ingredients out of order or at the same time, this has no effect.</p>
<p class="bas indent1"><span class="nm">(g)</span><span class="cl">(Gemara - Beraisa):</span> The nitre is of Alexandria, and not of Antifteris.</p>
<p class="bas indent1"><span class="nm">(h)</span><span class="cl">(Mishnah):</span> Boris...</p>
<p class="bas indent1"><span class="nm">(i)</span><span class="cl">(Rav Yehudah):</span> This is aloe.</p>
<p class="bas indent1"><span class="nm">(j)</span><span class="cl">Question (Beraisa):</span> Boris and aloe...</p>
<p class="bas indent1"><span class="nm">(k)</span><span class="cl">Retraction:</span> Rather, Boris is sulfur.</p>
<p class="bas indent1"><span class="nm">(l)</span><span class="cl">Question (Beraisa):</span> Chachamim added the following (they also have Kedushas Shemitah) -- ha'Leveitzin (bulb of ornithogalum), Le'unin (garden-orache), Boris and aloe...</p>
<p class="bas indent2"><span class="nm">1.</span>Shemitah does not apply to sulfur!</p>
<p class="bas indent2"><span class="nm">2.</span><span class="cl">(Beraisa):</span> Shemitah applies to things that have roots (in the ground), and to nothing else.</p>
<p class="bas indent1"><span class="nm">(m)</span><span class="cl">Answer (and defense of Rav Yehudah):</span> Rather, Boris is aloe.</p>
<p class="bas indent1"><span class="nm">(n)</span><span class="cl">Question (Beraisa):</span> Boris and aloe...</p>
<p class="bas indent1"><span class="nm">(o)</span><span class="cl">Answer:</span> These are two kinds of aloe.</p>
<p class="bas indent1"><span class="nm">(p)</span><span class="cl">(Mishnah):</span> Kemunia.</p>
<p class="bas indent1"><span class="nm">(q)</span><span class="cl">(Rav Yehudah):</span> This is Shelof Dotz (a type of grass used for washing hands).</p>
<p class="bas indent1"><span class="nm">(r)</span><span class="cl">(Mishnah):</span> Ashleg.</p>
<p class="bas indent1"><span class="nm">(s)</span><span class="cl">(Shmuel citing seafarers):</span> This is found in holes in gems. It is extracted using iron prongs.</p>
<p class="bas subject"><span class="nm">2)</span>THE TEST THAT REMOVES <i>KESAMIM</i></p>
<p class="bas indent1"><span class="nm">(a)</span><span class="cl">(Mishnah):</span> If one immersed a garment (and touched Taharos)...</p>
<p class="bas indent1"><span class="nm">(b)</span><span class="cl">(Beraisa #1):</span> If one applied the seven ingredients and the Kesem persisted, then he applied soap and the Kesem passed, the Taharos are Teme'im.</p>
<p class="bas indent1"><span class="nm">(c)</span><span class="cl">Objection:</span> (If the seven ingredients did not remove the Kesem,) surely it is dye! (Tosfos - even if it is blood, it is so deeply absorbed that it is Batel, as if it was dye.)</p>
<p class="bas indent1"><span class="nm">(d)</span><span class="cl">Correction:</span> Rather, if one applied six ingredients and the Kesem persisted, then he applied soap and the Kesem passed, the Taharos are (Safek) Teme'im. Perhaps also the seventh ingredient would have made it pass!</p>
<p class="bas indent1"><span class="nm">(e)</span><span class="cl">(Beraisa #2):</span> If one applied the seven ingredients and the Kesem persisted, then he applied them again and the Kesem passed, the Taharos are Tehoros.</p>
<p class="bas indent1"><span class="nm">(f)</span><span class="cl">(R. Zeira):</span> This refers only to Taharos touched between the first and second laundering. Taharos touched after the second laundering are Teme'im, for (by repeating the process) he showed that he cares about the stain. (Therefore, it is not Batel.)</p>
<p class="bas bbbline">62b----------------------------------------62b</p>
<p class="bas indent1"><span class="nm">(g)</span><span class="cl">Question (R. Aba):</span> Does the Tum'ah depend on his concern?!</p>
<p class="bas indent1"><span class="nm">(h)</span><span class="cl">Answer (Rav Ashi):</span> Yes!</p>
<p class="bas indent2"><span class="nm">1.</span><span class="cl">(Beraisa - R. Chiya):</span> If one applies the seven ingredients to Vadai Dam Nidah, he is Mevatel it. (Now, it is Tahor.)</p>
<p class="bas indent2"><span class="nm">2.</span><span class="cl">Question:</span> The blood is still there!</p>
<p class="bas indent2"><span class="nm">3.</span><span class="cl">Answer:</span> Since he does not care about it, it is Tahor.</p>
<p class="bas indent2"><span class="nm">4.</span><span class="cl">Summation of Answer (h):</span> Here also, the Tum'ah depends on what he cares about!</p>
<p class="bas subject"><span class="nm">3)</span>ABSORBED <i>TUM'AH</i></p>
<p class="bas indent1"><span class="nm">(a)</span><span class="cl">(Mishnah):</span> If a Kli Cheres absorbed Mashkim (this will be explained) of a Zav and fell into an oven, if the oven was ignited it is Tamei, for the Mashkim will ultimately leave the Cheres (due to the fire. It is as if they already left.)</p>
<p class="bas indent1"><span class="nm">(b)</span><span class="cl">(Reish Lakish):</span> This is only if the Mashkim were Kalim (Rishonim l'Tum'ah). If they were Chamurim (Avos ha'Tum'ah, e.g. his urine), the oven is Tamei whether or not it was ignited.</p>
<p class="bas indent1"><span class="nm">(c)</span><span class="cl">(R. Yochanan):</span> Even if the Mashkim were Chamurim, the oven is Tamei only if it was ignited.</p>
<p class="bas indent1"><span class="nm">(d)</span><span class="cl">Question (R. Yochanan, against Reish Lakish - Mishnah):</span> If one immersed a garment, (wore the garment and) touched Taharos, applied the seven ingredients and the Kesem persisted, the Kesem is dye, and the Taharos are Tehorim. (If absorbed Tum'ah is Metamei as if it left, we should be concerned lest there is blood inside!)</p>
<p class="bas indent1"><span class="nm">(e)</span><span class="cl">Answer:</span> Tum'as Kesamim is mid'Rabanan. (Therefore we are Metaher the Safek).</p>
<p class="bas indent1"><span class="nm">(f)</span><span class="cl">Question (Beraisa - R. Chiya):</span> If one applies the seven ingredients to Vadai Dam Nidah, he is Mevatel it.</p>
<p class="bas indent1"><span class="nm">(g)</span><span class="cl">Answer (Reish Lakish):</span> The Beraisa is mistaken. If Rebbi did not teach this in a Mishnah (the Mishnah implies that the ingredients Mevatel only Kesamim, but not Vadai blood), how could R. Chiya (his Talmid) know it?!</p>
<p class="bas indent1"><span class="nm">(h)</span><span class="cl">Question (R. Yochanan, against Reish Lakish - Mishnah):</span> If a Revi'is of blood (of a Mes) was absorbed in (the floor of) a house, (some texts - any Kli in) the house is Tahor. Some say, it is Tamei;</p>
<p class="bas indent2"><span class="nm">1.</span>These two opinions do not argue. Before the blood was absorbed, it is Tamei. (If a Kli was brought into the house) after it was absorbed, it is Tahor.</p>
<p class="bas indent2"><span class="nm">2.</span><span class="cl">(Continuation of Mishnah):</span> If a Revi'is of blood was absorbed in a garment, it is Metamei b'Ohel only if a Revi'is of blood will come out through laundering. (Even though a Revi'is is absorbed, since it will not come out easily, it is not Metamei!)</p>
<p class="bas indent1"><span class="nm">(i)</span><span class="cl">Answer (Rav Kahana):</span> (Normally, absorbed Tum'ah is Metamei.) The Mishnah discusses Dam Tevusah. (We are unsure whether it came out before or after death). Since it is Metamei b'Ohel only mid'Rabanan, Chachamim were lenient.</p>
<p class="bas indent1"><span class="nm">(j)</span><span class="cl">Question (Reish Lakish, again R. Yochanan - Mishnah):</span> Any absorbed Tum'ah that cannot leave is Tahor.</p>
<p class="bas indent2"><span class="nm">1.</span><span class="cl">Inference:</span> If it can leave it is Tamei, even before it leaves!</p>
<p class="bas indent1"><span class="nm">(k)</span><span class="cl">Answer (Rav Papa):</span> Whenever it cannot leave (easily) and one does not care about it, all agree that it is Tahor;</p>
<p class="bas indent2"><span class="nm">1.</span>Whenever it can leave and one cares about it, all agree that it is Tamei;</p>
<p class="bas indent2"><span class="nm">2.</span>They argue about when it can leave and one does not care about it. Reish Lakish holds that since it can leave, even though he does not care about it, it is Tamei;</p>
<p class="bas indent2"><span class="nm">3.</span>R. Yochanan holds that even though it can leave, it is Tamei only if he cares about it.</p>
