<div class="subject"><span class="nm">1)</span><p>HOW TO DESTROY CHAMETZ</p></div>
<div class="indent1"><span class="nm">(a)</span><p><span class="cl">R. Yehudah:</span> I can learn differently:</p></div>
<div class="indent2"><span class="nm">1.</span><p>"Lo Sosiru" applies to Chametz (one may not leave it in his house), and to Nosar (one may not leave Kodshim past the allotted time to eat it) - just like Nosar must be burned, also Chametz!</p></div>
<div class="indent1"><span class="nm">(b)</span><p><span class="cl">Chachamim:</span> Asham Taluy (a Korban brought for one who is unsure whether or not he transgressed an Isur Kares) and Chatas ha'Of brought on account of a Safek disprove this, according to you - Bal Sosiru applies to them - we say that they are burned, but you say that they are buried! (see note in Appendix)</p></div>
<div class="indent1"><span class="nm">(c)</span><p>R. Yehudah could not answer.</p></div>
<div class="indent1"><span class="nm">(d)</span><p><span class="cl">Rav Yosef:</span> This is like people say - the spoon the craftsman made will burn his mouth with mustard (R. Yehudah's own opinion about Asham Taluy refutes him)!</p></div>
<div class="indent1"><span class="nm">(e)</span><p><span class="cl">Abaye:</span> The carpenter made the stockade, and he himself [transgressed and] was locked inside his own handiwork.</p></div>
<div class="indent1"><span class="nm">(f)</span><p><span class="cl">Rava:</span> One who makes arrows was killed by an arrow, his own handiwork.</p></div>
<div class="indent1"><span class="nm">(g)</span><p><span class="cl">(Mishnah - Chachamim):</span> One may even crumble it and cast it into the wind or the sea.</p></div>
<div class="indent1"><span class="nm">(h)</span><p><span class="cl">Question:</span> What does this mean?</p></div>
<div class="indent2"><span class="nm">1.</span><p>Does it mean that one must crumble it, and then cast it into the wind or sea;</p></div>
<div class="indent2"><span class="nm">2.</span><p>Or, does it mean that he may crumble it and cast it into the wind, or may cast it intact into the sea?</p></div>
<div class="indent1"><span class="nm">(i)</span><p>We have a similar question regarding idolatry:</p></div>
<div class="indent2"><span class="nm">1.</span><p><span class="cl">(Mishnah - R. Yosi):</span> One grinds up [idols] and throw the dust to the wind, or casts to the sea.</p></div>
<div class="indent2"><span class="nm">2.</span><p><span class="cl">Question:</span> Does it mean that one grinds them, and then casts the dust to the wind or sea - or, does it mean that he may grind them and cast the dust to the wind, or he may cast idols intact into the sea?</p></div>
<div class="indent1"><span class="nm">(j)</span><p><span class="cl">Answer #1 (Rabah):</span> Presumably, since idols are cast to the Dead Sea (the Mishnah did not specify this, but we know that idolatry generally goes there), they need not be ground up (ships do not go there, we are not concerned lest someone find them) - but Chametz may be cast to any sea, so it must be crumbled.</p></div>
<div class="indent1"><span class="nm">(k)</span><p><span class="cl">Objection (and Answer #2 - Rav Yosef):</span> Just the contrary! Idols do not dissolve in water, so they must be ground up - Chametz dissolves in water, so it need not be crumbled!</p></div>
<div class="indent1"><span class="nm">(l)</span><p><span class="cl">Support (for Rabah - Beraisa #1):</span> If one was in the Midbar [at the time of Bi'ur Chametz], he crumbles it and casts it into the wind; if he was in a boat, he crumbles it and casts it into the sea.</p></div>
<div class="indent1"><span class="nm">(m)</span><p><span class="cl">Support (for Rav Yosef - Beraisa #2):</span> If one was in the Midbar [and had idolatry to destroy], he grinds it up and casts [the dust] to the wind; if he was in a boat, he strews it and casts it to the sea.</p></div>
<div class="indent1"><span class="nm">(n)</span><p><span class="cl">Questions:</span> Beraisa #2 is difficult for Rabah - it requires grinding [up idolatry before casting to the sea], and Beraisa #1 is difficult for Rav Yosef - it requires strewing (crumbling Chametz before casting it to the sea! The Beraisos do not contradict each other - no Tana'ic source explicitly permits casting idolatry or Chametz intact to the sea!)</p></div>
<div class="indent1"><span class="nm">(o)</span><p><span class="cl">Answer - part 1 (for Rabah):</span> Beraisa #2 requires grinding up idolatry to cast to other seas - the Mishnah discusses the Dead Sea, there it may be cast intact.</p></div>
<div class="indent1"><span class="nm">(p)</span><p><span class="cl">Answer - part 2 (for Rav Yosef):</span> Beraisa #1 discusses a sack of wheat that fermented - one must strew, i.e. scatter it [so no one will be able to retrieve it] - the Mishnah discusses bread, it may be cast intact.</p></div>
<div class="subject"><span class="nm">2)</span><p>WHEN DO THE LAVIM OF CHAMETZ APPLY?</p></div>
<div class="indent1"><span class="nm">(a)</span><p><span class="cl">(Mishnah):</span> One may benefit from Chametz that a Nochri owned on Pesach;</p></div>
<div class="indent1"><span class="nm">(b)</span><p>Chametz that a Yisrael owned on Pesach is Asur b'Hana'ah, for it says "V'Lo Yera'eh Lecha."</p></div>
<div class="indent1"><span class="nm">(c)</span><p><span class="cl">(Gemara) Question:</span> Our Mishnah is not like R. Yehudah, R. Shimon, or R. Yosi ha'Gelili!</p></div>
<div class="indent1"><span class="nm">(d)</span><p><span class="cl">(Beraisa - R. Yehudah):</span> One who eats Chametz [from midday on the 14th, when it becomes forbidden] before the time [nightfall, which starts Pesach] or after the time [the end of Pesach] transgresses a Lav; during the time [Pesach itself] he transgresses a Lav with Kares;</p></div>
<div class="bbbline">28b----------------------------------------28b</p></div>
<div class="indent1"><span class="nm">(e)</span><p>R. Shimon says, before the time or after the time he does not transgress (Tosfos - a Lav, but it is forbidden mid'Oraisa before the time); during the time he transgresses a Lav with Kares;</p></div>
<div class="indent1"><span class="nm">(f)</span><p>From the time one may not eat it, it is Asur b'Hana'ah;</p></div>
<div class="indent1"><span class="nm">(g)</span><p>This last clause is according to R. Yehudah (the Gemara interjected this in the middle of the Beraisa).</p></div>
<div class="indent1"><span class="nm">(h)</span><p><span class="cl">R. Yosi ha'Gelili:</span> How can you say that Chametz is Asur b'Hana'ah all seven days of Pesach?!</p></div>
<div class="indent1"><span class="nm">(i)</span><p><span class="cl">Question:</span> What is the source that one who eats Chametz after six hours [on the 14th] transgresses a Lav?</p></div>
<div class="indent1"><span class="nm">(j)</span><p><span class="cl">Answer (R. Yehudah):</span> "Lo Sochal <i>Alav</i> (from the time you may slaughter Korban Pesach) Chametz."</p></div>
<div class="indent1"><span class="nm">(k)</span><p><span class="cl">R. Shimon:</span> You cannot say so - it says "Lo Sochal Alav Chametz Shiv'as Yomim Tochal Alav Matzos" (the verse discusses the time one may <i>eat</i> Korban Pesach, [which is eaten with Matzah], i.e. night)!</p></div>
<div class="indent1"><span class="nm">(l)</span><p><span class="cl">Question:</span> If so, what do we learn from "Lo Sochal Alav Chametz"?</p></div>
<div class="indent1"><span class="nm">(m)</span><p><span class="cl">Answer:</span> The Lav "Lo Sochal Alav Chametz" and the Ase "Tochal Alav Matzos" apply at the same time (i.e. starting at night).</p></div>
<div class="subject"><span class="nm">3)</span><p>DIFFERENT WAYS TO EXPOUND THE VERSES</p></div>
<div class="indent1"><span class="nm">(a)</span><p><span class="cl">Question:</span> What is R. Yehudah's reason?</p></div>
<div class="indent1"><span class="nm">(b)</span><p><span class="cl">Answer:</span> There are three verses [forbidding Chametz] - "V'Lo Ye'achel Chametz," "Kol Machmetzes Lo Sochelu," and "Lo Sochal Alav Chametz" - one applies before the time, one during the time, and one after the time.</p></div>
<div class="indent1"><span class="nm">(c)</span><p>R. Shimon says that one applies during the time;</p></div>
<div class="indent2"><span class="nm">1.</span><p>Kol Machmetzes Lo Sochelu" teaches the following:</p></div>
<div class="indent3"><span class="nm">i.</span><p><span class="cl">(Beraisa) Question:</span> "Chametz" forbids something that became Chametz by itself (surely this includes Chametz leavened by other Chametz (Se'or), this is the ultimate Chametz) - what is the source to forbid Chametz leavened through other things?</p></div>
<div class="indent3"><span class="nm">ii.</span><p><span class="cl">Answer:</span> "Kol Machmetzes Lo Sochelu."</p></div>
<div class="indent2"><span class="nm">2.</span><p>"Lo Yochal Chametz" teaches the following:</p></div>
<div class="indent3"><span class="nm">i.</span><p><span class="cl">(Beraisa - R. Yosi ha'Gelili) Question:</span> What is the source that during Pesach [at the time of Yetzi'as] Miztrayim, Chametz was forbidden only one day?</p></div>
<div class="indent3"><span class="nm">ii.</span><p><span class="cl">Answer:</span> It says "V'Lo Ye'achel Chametz; Ha'Yom Atem Yotz'im."</p></div>
<div class="indent1"><span class="nm">(d)</span><p><span class="cl">Question:</span> What is R. Yehudah's source to forbid something that became Chametz on account of something else?</p></div>
<div class="indent1"><span class="nm">(e)</span><p><span class="cl">Answer:</span> We learn from the word "Machmetzes" itself.</p></div>
<div class="indent1"><span class="nm">(f)</span><p><span class="cl">Question:</span> What is his source for R. Yosi ha'Gelili's teaching?</p></div>
<div class="indent1"><span class="nm">(g)</span><p><span class="cl">Answer #1:</span> He learns from the Semichus [adjacency] of "Ha'Yom'" right after "V'Lo Ye'achel Chametz."</p></div>
<div class="indent1"><span class="nm">(h)</span><p><span class="cl">Answer #2:</span> [He argues with R. Yosi's teaching, for outside of Sefer Devarim] he does not expound Semuchim.</p></div>
<div class="indent1"><span class="nm">(i)</span><p><span class="cl">(Beraisa) Question:</span> What is the source that one who eats Chametz after six hours transgresses a Lav?</p></div>
<div class="indent1"><span class="nm">(j)</span><p><span class="cl">Answer (R. Yehudah):</span> "Lo Sochal Alav Chametz."</p></div>
<div class="indent1"><span class="nm">(k)</span><p><span class="cl">R. Shimon:</span> You cannot say so - it says Lo Sochal Alav Chametz Shiv'as Yomim Tochal Alav Matzos (implying that Chametz is forbidden only when Matzos must be eaten, i.e. at night)!</p></div>
<div class="indent1"><span class="nm">(l)</span><p><span class="cl">Question:</span> How does R. Yehudah answer this?!</p></div>
<div class="indent1"><span class="nm">(m)</span><p><span class="cl">Answer:</span> The verse commands to eat Matzah even nowadays [when we cannot offer Korban Pesach, by equating eating Matzah to the Isur of Chametz, which is for all generations].</p></div>
<div class="indent1"><span class="nm">(n)</span><p><span class="cl">Question:</span> What is R. Shimon's source for this?</p></div>
<div class="indent1"><span class="nm">(o)</span><p><span class="cl">Answer:</span> He learns from "Ba'Erev Tochlu [Matzos]".</p></div>
<div class="indent1"><span class="nm">(p)</span><p>R. Yehudah says that this is needed for one who was Tamei or far from the Mikdash;</p></div>
<div class="indent2"><span class="nm">1.</span><p>One might have thought that since he cannot eat Pesach, he need not eat Matzah or Maror - the verse teaches that this is not so.</p></div>
<div class="indent1"><span class="nm">(q)</span><p>R. Shimon does not need a verse for a Tamei or someone far from the Mikdash - he holds that there is no reason to exempt them more than one who is Arel (uncircumcised) or a Ben Nechar (a wanton sinner):</p></div>
<div class="indent2"><span class="nm">1.</span><p>"V'Chol Arel Lo Yochal <i>Bo</i>" - he may not eat it (Korban Pesach), but he eats Matzah and Maror (Chidushei. ha'Ran - the Gemara mentioned Maror along with Matzah, but really [mid'Oraisa] the only Mitzvah to eat Maror is with Korban Pesach.)</p></div>
<div class="indent1"><span class="nm">(r)</span><p>R. Yehudah holds that there are verses for both of them.</p></div>
