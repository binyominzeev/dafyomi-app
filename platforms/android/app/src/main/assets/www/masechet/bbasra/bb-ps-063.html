<p class="bas subject"><span class="nm">1)</span>IMPRECISE EXPRESSIONS ABOUT HOW MUCH ONE SOLD</p>
<p class="bas indent1"><span class="nm">(a)</span><span class="cl">Rejection:</span> Rav Yemar bar Shalmiyah said in the name of Abaye that no matter which expression he used, if he added (the extra words) 'these are the borders', he sold half. If not, he sold only nine Kavim.</p>
<p class="bas indent1"><span class="nm">(b)</span><span class="cl">Question:</span> Obviously, if Reuven said 'Ploni will divide my property', he gets half;</p>
<p class="bas indent2"><span class="nm">1.</span>If he said 'give to him a portion of my property', what is the law?</p>
<p class="bas indent1"><span class="nm">(c)</span><span class="cl">Answer (Ravina bar Kisi - Beraisa - Sumchus):</span> If Shimon said 'give to Ploni a portion in the pit', he gets a quarter. (We are unsure if he gets half, or an arbitrarily small share. Sumchus holds that when we are in doubt, we divide.) If he said 'for the barrel' (to give to his animals to drink), he gets an eighth. (Half is needed for the animals. We are unsure if he meant half of the half (a quarter), or an arbitrarily small share, therefore he gets half of a quarter.) If he said 'for the pot' (for food preparation, for which a third is proper. Perhaps he meant half of this, therefore), he gets one part in 12. If he said 'for the pitcher (for people to drink, for which a quarter is proper)', he gets one part in 16.</p>
<p class="bas indent1"><span class="nm">(d)</span><span class="cl">(Beraisa):</span> If a Levi sold his field to a Yisrael (Yehudah), and said 'on condition that the Ma'aser remains mine', he keeps the Ma'aser;</p>
<p class="bas indent2"><span class="nm">1.</span>If he said '(the Ma'aser is) mine and my son's', if he died, the Ma'aser belongs to his son.</p>
<p class="bas indent2"><span class="nm">2.</span>If he said 'as long as you have the field', and Yehudah sold it and bought it back, the Levi has no more claim to the Ma'aser.</p>
<p class="bas indent1"><span class="nm">(e)</span><span class="cl">Question:</span> Why does the stipulation work? One cannot acquire something (e.g. the Ma'aser) that is not yet in the world!</p>
<p class="bas indent1"><span class="nm">(f)</span><span class="cl">Answer:</span> Through saying 'on condition that the Ma'aser remains mine', he kept the Ma'aser for himself.</p>
<p class="bas indent1"><span class="nm">(g)</span><span class="cl">(Reish Lakish):</span> This (Beraisa) teaches that if one sells a house and stipulates 'on condition that the top is mine', the top is his.</p>

<p class="bas indent1"><span class="nm">(h)</span><span class="cl">Question:</span> What law do we learn from this?</p>
<p class="bas indent1"><span class="nm">(i)</span><span class="cl">Answer #1 (Rav Zvid):</span> He may extend ledges from it.</p>
<p class="bas indent1"><span class="nm">(j)</span><span class="cl">Answer #2 (Rav Papa):</span> He may build another story on top of it.</p>
<p class="bas indent1"><span class="nm">(k)</span><span class="cl">Question:</span> According to Rav Zvid, we understand why Reish Lakish said 'this teaches that', for we would not know it without the Beraisa.</p>
<p class="bas indent2"><span class="nm">1.</span>But according to Rav Papa, even without the Beraisa, we would learn this from his extra words!</p>
<p class="bas indent2"><span class="nm">2.</span>This is left difficult.</p>
<p class="bas subject"><span class="nm">2)</span>ACQUIRING THE HEIGHT AND DEPTH</p>
<p class="bas indent1"><span class="nm">(a)</span><span class="cl">(Rav Dimi of Neharde'a):</span> If Reuven sells his house to Shimon (and wants to include the pit and cistern), it is not enough to write 'the depth and height.' He must write also 'from the Tehom (the depth below the earth) to the sky.'</p>
<p class="bas indent1"><span class="nm">(b)</span><span class="cl">Question:</span> What is the reason?</p>
<p class="bas indent1"><span class="nm">(c)</span><span class="cl">Answer:</span> Stam (without specifying), the buyer does not acquire the depth and height (the seller could dig underneath, and retains a roof if it has a Ma'akeh);</p>
<p class="bas indent2"><span class="nm">1.</span>Therefore, if he wrote only 'the depth and height', this includes only the depth and height;</p>
<p class="bas indent2"><span class="nm">2.</span>He must write also 'from the Tehom to the sky' to include the pit, cistern and tunnels.</p>
<p class="bas indent1"><span class="nm">(d)</span><span class="cl">Support (Mishnah):</span> The buyer does not acquire the pit and cistern, even if the seller wrote 'the depth and height.'</p>
<p class="bas indent2"><span class="nm">1.</span>If you will say that Stam, the buyer acquires the depth and height, writing 'the depth and height', should include the pit, cistern and tunnels!</p>
<p class="bas indent1"><span class="nm">(e)</span><span class="cl">Rejection:</span> No, the Mishnah discusses when he did not write 'the depth and height'.</p>
<p class="bas indent1"><span class="nm">(f)</span><span class="cl">Question:</span> It says 'even if the seller wrote 'the depth and height'!'</p>
<p class="bas indent1"><span class="nm">(g)</span><span class="cl">Answer:</span> No.  It means, even if the seller did not write 'the depth and height', it is as if he wrote it (to include the depth and height);</p>
<p class="bas indent2"><span class="nm">1.</span>To include the pit, cistern and tunnels, he must write 'the depth and height.'</p>
