<div class="indent1"><span class="nm">(a)</span><p><span class="cl">(Mishnah):</span> The Zero'a, Lechayayim and Kevah (the upper two bones of the foreleg, the jaw and stomach. One who slaughters a Chulin Behemah gives them to a Kohen) apply in Eretz Yisrael and Chutz la'Aretz, whether or not the Mikdash stands. They apply to Chulin, but not to Kodshim. (Unspecified 'Matanos' refers to the Zero'a, Lechayayim and Kevah.)</p></div>
<div class="indent1"><span class="nm">(b)</span><p><span class="cl">Suggestion:</span> A Kal va'Chomer should obligate Matanos from Kodshim!</p></div>
<div class="indent2"><span class="nm">1.</span><p>Chazeh v'Shok (the chest and thigh) of Chulin are not given to Kohanim, but Matanos are. Chazeh v'Shok of Kodshim are given to Kohanim, all the more so Matanos should be given!</p></div>
<div class="indent1"><span class="nm">(c)</span><p><span class="cl">Rejection:</span> "Va'Eten Osam" - (from Shelamim,) Kohanim receive only Chazeh v'Shok.</p></div>
<div class="indent1"><span class="nm">(d)</span><p>If an animal with a permanent blemish was made Hekdesh, after it is redeemed the following apply;</p></div>
<div class="indent2"><span class="nm">1.</span><p>Kedushas Bechor (if it bears a firstborn male); Matanos; one may shear it and work with it; its offspring and milk are permitted;</p></div>
<div class="indent2"><span class="nm">2.</span><p>Before redemption, one who slaughters it outside (of the Mikdash) is exempt; its Temurah is not Kodesh; if it dies, we redeem it.</p></div>
<div class="indent2"><span class="nm">3.</span><p>These apply to all Korbanos except for Bechor and Ma'aser.</p></div>
<div class="indent1"><span class="nm">(e)</span><p>If an animal got a permanent blemish only after it was Hukdash (even if it had a temporary blemish beforehand), after it is redeemed --</p></div>
<div class="indent2"><span class="nm">1.</span><p>Kedushas Bechor does not apply; it is exempt from Matanos; one may not shear it nor work with it; its offspring and milk are forbidden;</p></div>
<div class="indent2"><span class="nm">2.</span><p>Before redemption, one who slaughters it outside is liable; its Temurah is Kodesh; if it dies, we bury it. (It may not be redeemed.)</p></div>
<div class="indent1"><span class="nm">(f)</span><p><span class="cl">(Gemara) Inference:</span> The Torah needed to write "Osam". If not, Matanos would apply to Kodshim.</p></div>
<div class="indent1"><span class="nm">(g)</span><p><span class="cl">Question:</span> We cannot learn from Chulin, for Kedushas Bechor applies to Chulin!</p></div>
<div class="indent1"><span class="nm">(h)</span><p><span class="cl">Answer:</span> We learn from Chulin males. (There is no Kedushah to the firstborn of a male animal.)</p></div>
<div class="indent1"><span class="nm">(i)</span><p><span class="cl">Question:</span> We cannot learn from Chulin males, for Reishis ha'Gez applies to them!</p></div>
<div class="indent1"><span class="nm">(j)</span><p><span class="cl">Answer:</span> We learn from male goats. Reishis ha'Gez does not apply to them.</p></div>
<div class="indent1"><span class="nm">(k)</span><p><span class="cl">Question:</span> We cannot learn from male goats, for Ma'aser applies to them!</p></div>
<div class="indent1"><span class="nm">(l)</span><p><span class="cl">Answer:</span> We learn from old (male goats. Ma'aser applies only to animals in their first year.)</p></div>
<div class="indent1"><span class="nm">(m)</span><p><span class="cl">Question:</span> We cannot learn from old animals, for Ma'aser once applied to them!</p></div>
<div class="indent1"><span class="nm">(n)</span><p><span class="cl">Answer:</span> We learn from an animal that was bought, or its mother died at birth. (Ma'aser does not apply to them.)</p></div>
<div class="indent1"><span class="nm">(o)</span><p><span class="cl">Question:</span> We cannot learn from them, for Ma'aser applies to their species!</p></div>
<div class="indent1"><span class="nm">(p)</span><p><span class="cl">Answer:</span> Ma'aser applies also to the same species as Kodshim!</p></div>
<div class="indent1"><span class="nm">(q)</span><p><span class="cl">Suggestion:</span> A Kal va'Chomer should teach that Chazeh v'Shok of Chulin are given to Kohanim:</p></div>
<div class="indent2"><span class="nm">1.</span><p>Matanos do not apply to Kodshim, but Chazeh v'Shok do. Matanos apply to Chulin, all the more so Chazeh v'Shok apply!</p></div>
<div class="indent1"><span class="nm">(r)</span><p><span class="cl">Rejection:</span> "V'Zeh Yihyeh Mishpat ha'Kohanim" - only Matanos apply to Chulin, but not Chazeh v'Shok.</p></div>
<div class="indent1"><span class="nm">(s)</span><p><span class="cl">Objection:</span> Why is a verse needed? Chazeh v'Shok could not apply to Chulin, for Tenufah (waving) is required;</p></div>
<div class="indent2"><span class="nm">1.</span><p>Tenufah cannot be done outside the Mikdash. It must be "Lifnei Hash-m"!</p></div>
<div class="bbbline">130b----------------------------------------130b</p></div>
<div class="indent2"><span class="nm">2.</span><p>Tenufah cannot be done in the Mikdash. One may not bring Chulin into the Mikdash (Rashi - unless needed for the Avodah; Tosfos - in a way similar to Avodah).</p></div>
<div class="indent1"><span class="nm">(t)</span><p><span class="cl">Answer:</span> Rather, the verse teaches Rav Chisda's law;</p></div>
<div class="indent2"><span class="nm">1.</span><p><span class="cl">(Rav Chisda):</span> If one damages or eats Matanos Kehunah (things that must be given to Kohanim), he is exempt.</p></div>
<div class="subject"><span class="nm">2)</span><p>ONE WHO DAMAGES MATANOS KEHUNAH</p></div>
<div class="indent1"><span class="nm">(a)</span><p><span class="cl">Question:</span> What is Rav Chisda's reason?</p></div>
<div class="indent1"><span class="nm">(b)</span><p><span class="cl">Answer #1:</span> He learns from "v'Zeh Yihyeh Mishpat ha'Kohanim." (Matanos Kehunah themselves are given, but not compensation for damaging them.)</p></div>
<div class="indent1"><span class="nm">(c)</span><p><span class="cl">Answer #2:</span> No one can claim compensation. (The damager can say 'I will pay a different Kohen.')</p></div>
<div class="indent1"><span class="nm">(d)</span><p><span class="cl">Question (Beraisa):</span> "V'Zeh Yihyeh Mishpat ha'Kohanim" teaches that Beis Din enforces the Matanos.</p></div>
<div class="indent2"><span class="nm">1.</span><p><span class="cl">Suggestion:</span> This means that Beis Din makes a damager pay (to the first Kohen who claims from him)!</p></div>
<div class="indent1"><span class="nm">(e)</span><p><span class="cl">Answer:</span> No, it means that Beis Din forces a Yisrael to give the Matanos to a learned Kohen;</p></div>
<div class="indent2"><span class="nm">1.</span><p><span class="cl">(Rav Shmuel bar Nachmani):</span> We do not give Matanos to an ignoramus Kohen - "Lema'an Yechezku b'Soras Hash-m."</p></div>
<div class="indent1"><span class="nm">(f)</span><p><span class="cl">Question (Beraisa - R. Yehudah ben Beseira):</span> "Mishpat" teaches that Beis Din enforces the Matanos.</p></div>
<div class="indent2"><span class="nm">1.</span><p><span class="cl">Suggestion:</span> Perhaps Beis Din enforces even Chazeh v'Shok!</p></div>
<div class="indent2"><span class="nm">2.</span><p><span class="cl">Rejection:</span> It says "v'Zeh" (only the Matanos).</p></div>
<div class="indent2"><span class="nm">3.</span><p><span class="cl">Question:</span> Regarding what does Beis Din enforce the Matanos?</p></div>
<div class="indent3"><span class="nm">i.</span><p><span class="cl">Suggestion:</span> They make a Yisrael give to a learned Kohen.</p></div>
<div class="indent3"><span class="nm">ii.</span><p><span class="cl">Rejection:</span> That applies also to Chazeh v'Shok!</p></div>
<div class="indent2"><span class="nm">4.</span><p><span class="cl">Answer:</span> Rather, Beis Din makes a damager pay.</p></div>
<div class="indent1"><span class="nm">(g)</span><p><span class="cl">Answer:</span> The case is, the Kohen received them (and then a Yisrael damaged them).</p></div>
<div class="indent1"><span class="nm">(h)</span><p><span class="cl">Question:</span> If he already received them, obviously one who damages them is liable!</p></div>
<div class="indent1"><span class="nm">(i)</span><p><span class="cl">Answer:</span> The case is, he received the animal before the Matanos were separated. The Tana teaches that Matanos are considered separated (and the Kohen acquired them) even before they are separated.</p></div>
<div class="indent1"><span class="nm">(j)</span><p><span class="cl">Question (Mishnah - R. Eliezer):</span> If a rich person away from home has no money, he may take Matanos Aniyim (Leket, Shichechah and Pe'ah, which are left for the poor). When he gets home, he must pay.</p></div>
<div class="indent1"><span class="nm">(k)</span><p><span class="cl">Answer (Rav Chisda):</span> This is Midas Chasidus (it is beyond the letter of the law).</p></div>
<div class="indent1"><span class="nm">(l)</span><p><span class="cl">Objection #1 (Rava):</span> "He must pay" connotes letter of the law, and not Midas Chasidus!</p></div>
<div class="indent1"><span class="nm">(m)</span><p><span class="cl">Objection #2 (Rava):</span> Rav Chisda need not answer for R. Eliezer. The Halachah follows Chachamim (who exempt)!</p></div>
<div class="indent1"><span class="nm">(n)</span><p><span class="cl">(Rava):</span> Rather, the question was from Chachamim (in that Mishnah);</p></div>
<div class="indent2"><span class="nm">1.</span><p><span class="cl">Question (Mishnah - Chachamim):</span> When he gets home he is exempt, for he was poor at the time.</p></div>
<div class="indent3"><span class="nm">i.</span><p><span class="cl">Inference:</span> Had he been rich at the time, he would be liable!</p></div>
<div class="indent2"><span class="nm">2.</span><p><span class="cl">Answer (Rav Chisda):</span> This is Midas Chasidus.</p></div>
<div class="subject"><span class="nm">3)</span><p>WHEN KEDUSHAS TERUMAH BEGINS</p></div>
<div class="indent1"><span class="nm">(a)</span><p><span class="cl">Question (Beriasa):</span> If a Yisrael ate Tevel, or a Levi ate Ma'aser that is Tevel to Terumas Ma'aser (Terumas Ma'aser was not separated from it), he is exempt;</p></div>
<div class="indent2"><span class="nm">1.</span><p>"Asher Yarimu" - Terumah belongs to the Kohen only after it is separated.</p></div>
<div class="indent2"><span class="nm">2.</span><p><span class="cl">Inference:</span> Had he eaten it after it was separated, he would be liable.</p></div>
<div class="indent2"><span class="nm">3.</span><p>According to Rav Chisda, he should be exempt!</p></div>
<div class="indent1"><span class="nm">(b)</span><p><span class="cl">Answer:</span> Here also, the Kohen received the Tevel before the Yisrael or Levi ate it.</p></div>
<div class="indent2"><span class="nm">1.</span><p>The Tana holds that Terumah is considered separated even before it is separated.</p></div>
