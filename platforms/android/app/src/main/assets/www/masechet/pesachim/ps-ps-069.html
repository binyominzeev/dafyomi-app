<div class="subject"><span class="nm">1)</span><p>WHAT IS DOCHEH SHABBOS?</p></div>
<div class="indent1"><span class="nm">(a)</span><p><span class="cl">Question (Rav Ashi):</span> Even though R. Eliezer considers Simchah on Yom Tov to be Reshus, his opinion is difficult!</p></div>
<div class="indent2"><span class="nm">1.</span><p>On Yom Tov even Melachah is permitted for Reshus, but Shevus is not - on Shabbos, Melachah is permitted only for [certain] Mitzvos, all the more so Shevus is not permitted!</p></div>
<div class="indent1"><span class="nm">(b)</span><p><span class="cl">Answer:</span> R. Eliezer holds that Chachamim were more stringent [to decree Shevus] regarding Reshus than regarding Mitzvos.</p></div>
<div class="indent1"><span class="nm">(c)</span><p><span class="cl">(Beraisa - R. Eliezer):</span> Machshirei (preparations for a) Mitzvah after slaughter (Rashi - cleaning the innards; Tosfos - Haktarah of Chelev, even though it could be done on Motza'ei Shabbos) are Docheh Shabbos, even though the [primary] Mitzvah was already done - all the more so Machshirei Mitzvah before slaughter are Docheh!</p></div>
<div class="indent1"><span class="nm">(d)</span><p><span class="cl">Question #1 (R. Akiva):</span> Chachamim did not forbid Machshirei Mitzvah after slaughter, because slaughter was already Docheh Shabbos, but perhaps they forbade Machshirei Mitzvah before slaughter!</p></div>
<div class="indent1"><span class="nm">(e)</span><p><span class="cl">Question #2 (R. Akiva):</span> Also, perhaps the Korban will be found to be Pasul, and retroactively he was Mechalel Shabbos!</p></div>
<div class="indent1"><span class="nm">(f)</span><p><span class="cl">Objection:</span> If so, we should not slaughter for the same reason!</p></div>
<div class="indent1"><span class="nm">(g)</span><p><span class="cl">Affirmation:</span> Indeed, R. Akiva first asked Question #2, and R. Eliezer refuted it [like we did]; then R. Akiva asked Question #1.</p></div>
<div class="indent1"><span class="nm">(h)</span><p><span class="cl">(Mishnah - R. Akiva):</span> Haza'ah is Tochi'ach (disproves this)...</p></div>
<div class="indent1"><span class="nm">(i)</span><p><span class="cl">(Beraisa - R. Eliezer):</span> Akiva - you challenge me [and deny an explicit verse with a ridiculous Kal va'Chomer] from slaughter?! Your death should be through slaughter!</p></div>
<div class="indent1"><span class="nm">(j)</span><p><span class="cl">R. Akiva:</span> Do not deny what you taught to me - Haza'ah is only Shevus, yet it is not Docheh Shabbos!</p></div>
<div class="indent1"><span class="nm">(k)</span><p><span class="cl">Question:</span> If R. Eliezer taught this, why did he retract?</p></div>
<div class="indent1"><span class="nm">(l)</span><p><span class="cl">Answer #1 (Ula):</span> R. Eliezer taught that Haza'ah is not Docheh Shabbos for [enabling a Kohen to eat] Terumah, since [separation of] Terumah itself is not Docheh Shabbos [and the Terumah can be eaten after Shabbos];</p></div>
<div class="indent2"><span class="nm">1.</span><p>R. Akiva asked him from Terumah - Shevus is not Nidcheh for a Mitzvah;</p></div>
<div class="indent2"><span class="nm">2.</span><p>R. Eliezer thought that he asks from Haza'ah for Pesach.</p></div>
<div class="indent1"><span class="nm">(m)</span><p><span class="cl">Rejection (Rabah - Beraisa - R. Akiva):</span> Haza'ah of a Tamei Mes Tochi'ach - if his seventh day fell on Shabbos which was Erev Pesach, Shevus is not Nidcheh for a Mitzvah!</p></div>
<div class="indent1"><span class="nm">(n)</span><p><span class="cl">Conclusion:</span> This shows that R. Akiva asked about Haza'ah for Pesach!</p></div>
<div class="indent1"><span class="nm">(o)</span><p><span class="cl">Reiteration of Question (k):</span> If R. Eliezer taught this, why did he argue [with R. Akiva and say that it is Docheh Shabbos]?</p></div>
<div class="indent1"><span class="nm">(p)</span><p><span class="cl">Answer #2:</span> R. Eliezer forgot what he was taught about this; R. Akiva was trying to remind him.</p></div>
<div class="indent1"><span class="nm">(q)</span><p><span class="cl">Question:</span> Why didn't R. Akiva explicitly remind him?</p></div>
<div class="indent1"><span class="nm">(r)</span><p><span class="cl">Answer:</span> He holds that it is improper to explicitly tell one's Rebbi that the Rebbi forgot.</p></div>
<div class="subject"><span class="nm">2)</span><p>WHO MUST ENABLE HIMSELF TO BRING PESACH</p></div>
<div class="indent1"><span class="nm">(a)</span><p><span class="cl">Question:</span> Why doesn't Haza'ah Docheh for the sake of Pesach - it is mere movement of water!</p></div>
<div class="indent1"><span class="nm">(b)</span><p><span class="cl">Answer (Rabah):</span> This is a decree, lest one carry it four Amos in Reshus ha'Rabim.</p></div>
<div class="indent1"><span class="nm">(c)</span><p><span class="cl">Question:</span> R. Eliezer should permit, for he says that Machshirei Mitzvah are Docheh (l'Chatchilah one may carry in Reshus ha'Rabim to enable bringing Pesach)!</p></div>
<div class="indent1"><span class="nm">(d)</span><p><span class="cl">Answer:</span> That is only for a person who is already able and obligated to do the Mitzvah - here, the person is not able or obligated until after Haza'ah.</p></div>
<div class="indent1"><span class="nm">(e)</span><p><span class="cl">(Rabah):</span> According to R. Eliezer, one may heat water [on Shabbos] for a healthy baby to [bathe him to] strengthen him for Milah that day, but one may not heat water to strengthen a weak baby in order to circumcise him, for now he cannot be circumcised.</p></div>
<div class="indent1"><span class="nm">(f)</span><p><span class="cl">Objection (Rava):</span> If the baby is healthy, why does he need hot water?!</p></div>
<div class="indent1"><span class="nm">(g)</span><p><span class="cl">(Rava):</span> Rather, all babies are considered sick (need hot water) regarding Milah; [if hot water was not prepared before Shabbos,] one may not heat water on Shabbos for Milah, for the baby is not ready.</p></div>
<div class="indent1"><span class="nm">(h)</span><p><span class="cl">Question (against Rabah - Abaye - Beraisa - R. Eliezer):</span> If an Arel does not circumcise himself [on Erev Pesach], he is Chayav Kares [for not bringing Pesach].</p></div>
<div class="indent2"><span class="nm">1.</span><p>He is not ready, yet he is Chayav Kares - this shows that he is obligated!</p></div>
<div class="indent1"><span class="nm">(i)</span><p><span class="cl">Answer #1 (Rabah):</span> [An Arel is unlike a Tamei!] R. Eliezer holds that we do not slaughter Pesach and do Zerikah for one who is [now] Tamei Sheretz [or Tamei Mes on the seventh day];</p></div>
<div class="bbbline">69b----------------------------------------69b</p></div>
<div class="indent2"><span class="nm">1.</span><p>Regarding any Tum'ah that detains an individual to Pesach Sheni, the Tzibur brings Pesach b'Tumah;</p></div>
<div class="indent2"><span class="nm">2.</span><p>An individual is obligated to enable himself to bring Pesach only if a Tzibur [like him] would be required;</p></div>
<div class="indent2"><span class="nm">3.</span><p>If a Tzibur was [mostly] Arelim, they must circumcise themselves - therefore, an individual must do so, if he does not he is Chayav Kares;</p></div>
<div class="indent2"><span class="nm">4.</span><p>If a Tzibur was Tamei Mes, they need not do Haza'ah, for they may bring Pesach b'Tumah - therefore an individual [who did not do Hotza'ah and could not bring Pesach] is exempt.</p></div>
<div class="indent1"><span class="nm">(j)</span><p><span class="cl">Question (Rav Huna brei d'Rav Yehoshua):</span> Pesach Sheni is not incumbent on a Tzibur; yet it is incumbent on an individual!</p></div>
<div class="indent1"><span class="nm">(k)</span><p><span class="cl">Answer (Rava):</span> There is different, for the Tzibur brought Pesach Rishon.</p></div>
<div class="indent1"><span class="nm">(l)</span><p><span class="cl">Objection (Beraisa) Question:</span> Perhaps one is Chayav Kares only if he was Tahor and close [to the Mikdash on Pesach Rishon] - what is the source to include [people who were unable to bring Pesach, i.e.] an Arel, a Tamei Sheretz or other Temei'im?</p></div>
<div class="indent2"><span class="nm">1.</span><p><span class="cl">Answer:</span> "Veha'Ish" includes these.</p></div>
<div class="indent2"><span class="nm">2.</span><p>The Tana must hold that we do not slaughter and do Zerikah for one who is Tamei Sheretz - otherwise, he is like a Tahor!</p></div>
<div class="indent2"><span class="nm">3.</span><p><span class="cl">Inference:</span> Even though he cannot bring Pesach [in his current state], he is obligated [to immerse and bring Pesach], even though a Tzibur is not obligated (they may bring b'Tum'ah)!</p></div>
<div class="indent1"><span class="nm">(m)</span><p><span class="cl">Answer #2 (to Question (h) - Rava):</span> Rather, R. Eliezer holds that we slaughter and Zorek for a Tamei Sheretz - the same applies to a Tamei Mes on his seventh day;</p></div>
<div class="indent2"><span class="nm">1.</span><p>Haza'ah is needed only to enable him to eat the meat [at night] - eating is not Me'akev (therefore, Haza'ah is not Docheh).</p></div>
<div class="indent1"><span class="nm">(n)</span><p><span class="cl">Question (Rav Ada bar Ahavah):</span> If he may not do Haza'ah, the slaughter was Lo l'Ochlav (he may not eat it)!</p></div>
<div class="indent1"><span class="nm">(o)</span><p><span class="cl">Answer (Rava):</span> Lo l'Ochlav is for one who is sick or too old, who cannot eat - a Tamei [who could become Tahor by evening] could eat, he merely needs to fix himself!</p></div>
<div class="subject"><span class="nm">3)</span><p>WHICH MACHSIRIM ARE DOCHEH SHABBOS?</p></div>
<div class="indent1"><span class="nm">(a)</span><p><span class="cl">(Mishnah - R. Akiva):</span> The general rule is [any Melachah which could be done before Shabbos is not Docheh].</p></div>
<div class="indent1"><span class="nm">(b)</span><p><span class="cl">(Rav Yehudah):</span> The Halachah follows R. Akiva.</p></div>
<div class="indent1"><span class="nm">(c)</span><p>It was taught similarly regarding Milah:</p></div>
<div class="indent2"><span class="nm">1.</span><p><span class="cl">(Mishnah - R. Akiva):</span> The general rule is, a Melachah [for the sake of Milah] overrides Shabbos only if it cannot be done before Shabbos.</p></div>
<div class="indent2"><span class="nm">2.</span><p><span class="cl">(Rav Yehudah):</span> The Halachah follows R. Akiva.</p></div>
<div class="indent1"><span class="nm">(d)</span><p>Rav Yehudah needed to say this about both Mishnayos:</p></div>
<div class="indent2"><span class="nm">1.</span><p>Had he taught only regarding Pesach, one might have thought its Machshirim [possible from before Shabbos] are not Docheh, for 13 covenants were not made over it, unlike Milah [but all Machshirei Milah would be permitted];</p></div>
<div class="indent2"><span class="nm">2.</span><p>Had he taught only regarding Milah, one might have thought that its Machshirim are not Docheh because there is no Kares [for not circumcising on day eight], but all Machshirei Pesach would be permitted, since there is Kares for not bringing it.</p></div>
<div class="subject"><span class="nm">4)</span><p>WHEN IS CHAGIGAH OF THE 14TH BROUGHT?</p></div>
<div class="indent1"><span class="nm">(a)</span><p><span class="cl">(Mishnah) Question:</span> When is Pesach accompanied by Chagigah [of the 14th, a Shelamim]?</p></div>
<div class="indent1"><span class="nm">(b)</span><p><span class="cl">Answer:</span> It is brought when Pesach is brought on a weekday, in Taharah, and it is [too] small [to satiate the Chaburah], but not when Pesach is brought on Shabbos, b'Tum'ah, or is large [enough for the Chaburah].</p></div>
<div class="indent1"><span class="nm">(c)</span><p>Chagigah may be brought from flock or cattle, from sheep and goats, from male or females; it may be eaten for two days and one night.</p></div>
<div class="indent1"><span class="nm">(d)</span><p><span class="cl">(Gemara) Question:</span> What was taught [previously] that prompted our Tana to ask about Chagigah?</p></div>
<div class="indent1"><span class="nm">(e)</span><p><span class="cl">Answer:</span> He taught that carrying it and bringing it [from outside the Techum] are not Docheh Shabbos - it is brought only when Pesach is brought on a weekday, in Taharah, and it is small.</p></div>
