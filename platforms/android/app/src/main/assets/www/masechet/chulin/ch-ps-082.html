<div class="subject"><span class="nm">1)</span><p>INVALID SHECHITOS</p></div>
<div class="indent1"><span class="nm">(a)</span><p><span class="cl">Question:</span> Is Shechitah of a Parah Adumah really invalid?!</p></div>
<div class="indent2"><span class="nm">1.</span><p><span class="cl">(Beraisa - R. Shimon):</span> Parah Adumah can receive Tum'as Ochlim, because it was once proper to be eaten.</p></div>
<div class="indent2"><span class="nm">2.</span><p><span class="cl">(Reish Lakish):</span> He holds that the Parah may be redeemed after Shechitah, before it is burned.</p></div>
<div class="indent1"><span class="nm">(b)</span><p><span class="cl">Answer (R. Yochanan):</span> It is proper Shechitah. The (correct text of the) Mishnah does not list Parah Adumah.</p></div>
<div class="indent1"><span class="nm">(c)</span><p><span class="cl">Question:</span> Is Shechitah of Eglah Arufah really invalid?!</p></div>
<div class="indent2"><span class="nm">1.</span><p><span class="cl">(Mishnah):</span> If the murderer was found before the calf was beheaded, it may graze with the flock (it is not forbidden until it is beheaded!)</p></div>
<div class="indent1"><span class="nm">(d)</span><p><span class="cl">Answer (Reish Lakish citing R. Yanai):</span> It is proper Shechitah. The correct text of the Mishnah does not list Eglah Arufah.</p></div>
<div class="indent1"><span class="nm">(e)</span><p><span class="cl">Question:</span> Did R. Yanai really say this?!</p></div>
<div class="indent2"><span class="nm">1.</span><p><span class="cl">(R. Yanai):</span> There is a time from which the calf becomes forbidden (while alive). I forgot it.</p></div>
<div class="indent2"><span class="nm">2.</span><p><span class="cl">(Rabanan):</span> It is forbidden from when it is taken down to the Nachal (valley; Rambam - river.)</p></div>
<div class="indent2"><span class="nm">3.</span><p><span class="cl">(Summation of question):</span> R. Yanai could have said that the calf is permitted if the murderer was found before the calf was taken down, it is forbidden if he was found after it was taken down (that is when Shechitah is invalid)!</p></div>
<div class="indent1"><span class="nm">(f)</span><p><span class="cl">Answer (R. Pinchus):</span> Reish Lakish himself answered that the Mishnah does not list Eglah Arufah. (R. Yanai did not say so.)</p></div>
<div class="indent1"><span class="nm">(g)</span><p><span class="cl">Question (Rav Ashi):</span> Also Reish Lakish holds that it becomes forbidden while it is alive!</p></div>
<div class="indent2"><span class="nm">1.</span><p><span class="cl">(R. Yochanan):</span> The birds used for Taharas Metzora are permitted while alive. The slaughtered bird becomes forbidden when it is slaughtered.</p></div>
<div class="indent2"><span class="nm">2.</span><p><span class="cl">(Reish Lakish):</span> They become forbidden when they are bought.</p></div>
<div class="indent3"><span class="nm">i.</span><p>Reish Lakish learns a Gezerah Shavah "Kichah-Kichah" from Eglah Arufah (which also becomes forbidden while alive)!</p></div>
<div class="indent1"><span class="nm">(h)</span><p><span class="cl">Answer:</span> Rather, R. Chiya bar Aba said in the name of R. Yochanan that the Mishnah does not list Eglah Arufah. (R. Yanai and Reish Lakish did not say so.)</p></div>
<div class="subject"><span class="nm">2)</span><p>WHO MAY SLAUGHTER FIRST?</p></div>
<div class="indent1"><span class="nm">(a)</span><p><span class="cl">(Mishnah):</span> If Oso v'Es Beno were sold to two people, the first buyer slaughters first (i.e. today). If the second slaughtered first, he was zealous and profits (he may eat today.)</p></div>
<div class="indent1"><span class="nm">(b)</span><p><span class="cl">(Gemara - Rav Yosef):</span> (If they agree, either may slaughter first.) The Mishnah teaches that if both want to slaughter today, the first man prevails.</p></div>
<div class="indent1"><span class="nm">(c)</span><p><span class="cl">(Beraisa):</span> If the second slaughtered first, he was zealous and gained. He was zealous to avoid transgressing. He gained, he may eat the meat today.</p></div>
<div class="subject"><span class="nm">3)</span><p>MULTIPLE TRANSGRESSIONS</p></div>
<div class="indent1"><span class="nm">(a)</span><p><span class="cl">(Mishnah):</span> If a man slaughtered a cow and then its two children, he receives 80 lashes. (We will always list the Shechitos in order.)</p></div>
<div class="indent2"><span class="nm">1.</span><p>If he slaughtered the two children and then the mother, he receives 40 lashes;</p></div>
<div class="indent2"><span class="nm">2.</span><p>If he slaughtered a cow, its daughter and the daughter's daughter, he receives 80 lashes;</p></div>
<div class="indent2"><span class="nm">3.</span><p>If he slaughtered a cow and its daughter's daughter and the daughter, he receives 40 lashes;</p></div>
<div class="indent2"><span class="nm">4.</span><p>Sumchus says, he receive 80 lashes.</p></div>
<div class="indent1"><span class="nm">(b)</span><p><span class="cl">(Gemara) Question:</span> Why is he lashed (when he slaughters the mother last)? The Torah says "Oso v'Es Beno", but not 'Beno v'Oso'!</p></div>
<div class="indent1"><span class="nm">(c)</span><p><span class="cl">Answer (Beraisa):</span> "Oso v'Es Beno" is in that order;</p></div>
<div class="indent2"><span class="nm">1.</span><p>"You will not slaughter" includes another animal forbidden to slaughter;</p></div>
<div class="indent3"><span class="nm">i.</span><p>After slaughtering a cow, one who slaughters its mother or son is liable.</p></div>
<div class="bbbline">82b----------------------------------------82b</p></div>
<div class="indent2"><span class="nm">2.</span><p><span class="cl">Question:</span> "You will not slaughter" is necessary. It is not extra to be expounded!</p></div>
<div class="indent2"><span class="nm">3.</span><p><span class="cl">Answer:</span> It could have said 'you will not slaughter' in the singular. We expound the use of the plural form.</p></div>
<div class="indent2"><span class="nm">4.</span><p><span class="cl">Question:</span> Had it used the singular form, this would imply that it is only forbidden for one person to slaughter both animals. It used the plural form to show that even when two slaughter, the latter transgresses!</p></div>
<div class="indent2"><span class="nm">5.</span><p><span class="cl">Answer:</span> It could have said 'they will not slaughter' to forbid when two slaughter. It says "you (plural)" to include the son and mother.</p></div>
<div class="indent1"><span class="nm">(d)</span><p><span class="cl">(Mishnah):</span> If he slaughtered a cow and its granddaughter...</p></div>
<div class="indent1"><span class="nm">(e)</span><p><span class="cl">Question (Abaye):</span> What is Sumchus' reason?</p></div>
<div class="indent2"><span class="nm">1.</span><p><span class="cl">Possibility #1:</span> He holds that if one eats two k'Zeisim of Chelev in one Helam (i.e. without remembering in between that this is forbidden), he must bring two Chata'os. (This is called Ein Gufim Muchlakim, i.e. he is liable more than once even though he did not sin with discrete objects. Really, Sumchus should have taught a case of Ein Gufim Muchlakim;)</p></div>
<div class="indent3"><span class="nm">i.</span><p>The Mishnah teaches Oso v'Es Beno to show the extremity of Chachamim. They obligate only once even in a case of Gufim Muchlakim.</p></div>
<div class="indent2"><span class="nm">2.</span><p><span class="cl">Possibility #2:</span> He holds that if one eats two k'Zeisim in one Helam, he brings only one Chatas;</p></div>
<div class="indent3"><span class="nm">i.</span><p>Oso v'Es Beno is a case of Gufim Muchlakim, therefore he is liable twice.</p></div>
<div class="indent1"><span class="nm">(f)</span><p><span class="cl">Answer #1 (Rav Yosef):</span> A Beraisa shows that he holds like Possibility #1:</p></div>
<div class="indent2"><span class="nm">1.</span><p><span class="cl">(Beraisa):</span> If one sows Kilayim (a forbidden mixture of seeds) and Kilayim, he is lashed.</p></div>
<div class="indent2"><span class="nm">2.</span><p><span class="cl">Question:</span> How many lashes does he get?</p></div>
<div class="indent3"><span class="nm">i.</span><p><span class="cl">Suggestion:</span> He gets 40 lashes.</p></div>
<div class="indent3"><span class="nm">ii.</span><p><span class="cl">Rejection #1:</span> This is obvious. What is the Chidush of the Mishnah?!</p></div>
<div class="indent3"><span class="nm">iii.</span><p><span class="cl">Rejection #2:</span> If so, why does it say 'Kilayim and Kilayim'?</p></div>
<div class="indent2"><span class="nm">3.</span><p><span class="cl">Answer:</span> Rather, he gets 80 lashes.</p></div>
<div class="indent2"><span class="nm">4.</span><p><span class="cl">Question:</span> What is the case?</p></div>
<div class="indent3"><span class="nm">i.</span><p>If he received separate warning for each transgression, a Mishnah teaches this (in a different case)!</p></div>
<div class="indent3"><span class="nm">ii.</span><p><span class="cl">(Mishnah):</span> If a Nazir drank wine all day, he gets only 40 lashes. If he was warned repeatedly, he gets 40 lashes for each warning that he transgressed.</p></div>
<div class="indent2"><span class="nm">5.</span><p><span class="cl">Answer:</span> Rather, he was warned once, and he threw two sets of mixed seeds at the same time.</p></div>
<div class="indent2"><span class="nm">6.</span><p><span class="cl">Question:</span> Like whom is the Beraisa?</p></div>
<div class="indent3"><span class="nm">i.</span><p>It is not like Chachamim of (who argue with) Sumchus. Even in a case of Gufim Muchlakim, they obligate only once, and all the more so in this case!</p></div>
<div class="indent2"><span class="nm">7.</span><p><span class="cl">Answer:</span> Rather, it is like Sumchus.</p></div>
<div class="indent1"><span class="nm">(g)</span><p><span class="cl">Rejection:</span> No, it is like Chachamim. The Beraisa teaches that there are two ways to be liable for Kilayim, unlike R. Yoshiyah.</p></div>
<div class="indent2"><span class="nm">1.</span><p><span class="cl">(R. Yoshiyah):</span> One is liable for Kilai ha'Kerem (Kilayim with grapes) only if he sows a wheat seed, barley seed and grape seed together.</p></div>
<div class="indent2"><span class="nm">2.</span><p>The Beraisa obligates for wheat and grape seeds alone (i.e. without barley), and for barley and grape seeds alone.</p></div>
<div class="indent1"><span class="nm">(h)</span><p><span class="cl">Answer #2 (Mishnah):</span> If one ate a k'Zayis of the Gid ha'Nasheh of each thigh of an animal, he gets 80 lashes;</p></div>
<div class="indent1"><span class="nm">(i)</span><p>R. Yehudah says, he gets 40 lashes (only one of the Gidim is forbidden.)</p></div>
<div class="indent1"><span class="nm">(j)</span><p><span class="cl">Question:</span> What is the case?</p></div>
<div class="indent2"><span class="nm">1.</span><p><span class="cl">Suggestion:</span> He received separate Hasra'ah (warning) before eating each.</p></div>
<div class="indent2"><span class="nm">2.</span><p><span class="cl">Rejection:</span> If so, R. Yehudah would exempt, for he holds that Hasra'as Safek (we are unsure which Gid is forbidden) is invalid!</p></div>
<div class="indent3"><span class="nm">i.</span><p><span class="cl">(Beraisa):</span> If we are unsure if Reuven is the son of David or Moshe, and Reuven strikes or curses David and Moshe, one after the other or at the same time, he is liable (even though when he hits one at a time, we cannot say 'this is (surely) your father. Do not hit him!');</p></div>
<div class="indent3"><span class="nm">ii.</span><p>R. Yehudah says, he is liable only if he struck or cursed both at the same time.</p></div>
<div class="indent1"><span class="nm">(k)</span><p><span class="cl">Answer:</span> Rather, we must say that he received one Hasra'ah, and ate from both Gidim at the same time.</p></div>
<div class="indent1"><span class="nm">(l)</span><p><span class="cl">Question:</span> Who is the first Tana, who says he gets 80 lashes?</p></div>
<div class="indent2"><span class="nm">1.</span><p>It is not Chachamim of Sumchus. Even in a case of Gufim Muchlakim, they obligate only once, all the more so in this case!</p></div>
<div class="indent1"><span class="nm">(m)</span><p><span class="cl">Answer:</span> Rather, it is Sumchus.</p></div>
<div class="indent1"><span class="nm">(n)</span><p><span class="cl">Rejection:</span> Really, it is Chachamim. This Tana holds that R. Yehudah says that Hasra'as Safek is valid;</p></div>
<div class="indent2"><span class="nm">1.</span><p><span class="cl">(Beraisa - R. Yehudah):</span> "You may not leave over (from the Korban Pesach) until morning; you will burn what is left over" is a Mitzvas Aseh to fix the Lav, to exempt from lashes. (If not for the Aseh he would be lashed, even though there cannot be definite Hasra'ah. Perhaps the person will finish eating later!)</p></div>
<div class="indent2"><span class="nm">2.</span><p><span class="cl">(R. Yakov):</span> No, one is not lashed because this Lav is not transgressed through an action, rather through inaction.</p></div>
