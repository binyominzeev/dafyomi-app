<p class="bas subject"><span class="nm">1)</span>IF ONE GAVE THE MONEY AND <i>ASHAM</i> TO DIFFERENT DIVISIONS</p>
<p class="bas indent1"><span class="nm">(a)</span><span class="cl">(Mishnah):</span> If Reuven gave the money to division Yehoyariv...</p>
<p class="bas indent1"><span class="nm">(b)</span><span class="cl">(Beraisa - R. Yehudah):</span> If he gave the Asham to division Yehoyariv, and the money to Yadayah (the next division to serve), the money reverts to the division that received the Asham;</p>
<p class="bas indent1"><span class="nm">(c)</span>Chachamim say, the Asham reverts to the division that received the money.</p>
<p class="bas indent1"><span class="nm">(d)</span><span class="cl">Question:</span> What is the case?</p>
<p class="bas indent2"><span class="nm">1.</span>If each division was serving when it received the offering or money, each merits to keep what it got! (Even if Chachamim would fine Yehoyariv for taking the Asham before the money, R. Yehudah would not fine Yadayah, they did nothing wrong!)</p>
<p class="bas indent1"><span class="nm">(e)</span><span class="cl">Answer (Rava):</span> The case is, both were given when Yehoyariv was serving.</p>
<p class="bas indent2"><span class="nm">1.</span>R. Yehudah fines Yadayah for taking the money during the week of Yehoyariv (so they must give it to Yehoyariv);</p>
<p class="bas indent2"><span class="nm">2.</span>Chachamim fine Yehoyariv for taking the Asham before the money.</p>
<p class="bas indent1"><span class="nm">(f)</span><span class="cl">(Beraisa - Rebbi):</span> According to R. Yehudah, if Yehoyariv offered the Asham, Reuven must bring another Asham, which Yadayah offer; Yehoyariv do not lose what they have.</p>
<p class="bas indent1"><span class="nm">(g)</span><span class="cl">Question:</span> They have an invalid offering, it is useless!</p>
<p class="bas indent1"><span class="nm">(h)</span><span class="cl">Answer (Rava):</span> They can keep the skin.</p>
<p class="bas indent1"><span class="nm">(i)</span><span class="cl">(Beraisa #1 - Rebbi):</span> According to R. Yehudah, if the Asham is still around, the division that has the money offers it.</p>
<p class="bas indent1"><span class="nm">(j)</span><span class="cl">Question:</span> R. Yehudah holds that the money goes to the division with the Asham!</p>
<p class="bas indent1"><span class="nm">(k)</span><span class="cl">Answer:</span> The case is, Yehoyariv did not claim the money during its week, and thereby waived its privilege.</p>
<p class="bas indent1"><span class="nm">(l)</span><span class="cl">(Beraisa #2 - Rebbi):</span> According to R. Yehudah, if the Asham is still around, the money reverts to the division with the Asham.</p>
<p class="bas indent1"><span class="nm">(m)</span><span class="cl">Question:</span> This is obvious (this is what R. Yehudah taught)!</p>
<p class="bas indent1"><span class="nm">(n)</span><span class="cl">Answer:</span> Rebbi teaches about when neither division claimed from the other during its week;</p>
<p class="bas indent2"><span class="nm">1.</span>One might have thought that each waived its privileges and allows the other to keep what it has. Rebbi teaches that this is not so;</p>
<p class="bas indent2"><span class="nm">2.</span>Rather, Yehoyariv demands the money and brings the Asham the next time it serves.</p>
<p class="bas subject"><span class="nm">2)</span>THE MONEY MUST BE GIVEN FIRST</p>
<p class="bas indent1"><span class="nm">(a)</span><span class="cl">(Mishnah):</span> If one gave the money before offering the Asham (he was Yotzei, but if he offered the Asham first, he was not Yotzei).</p>
<p class="bas indent1"><span class="nm">(b)</span><span class="cl">Question:</span> What is the source of this?</p>
<p class="bas indent1"><span class="nm">(c)</span><span class="cl">Answer (Rava):</span> "The Asham that is returned to Hash-m, to the Kohen, aside from the ram of atonement, with which he will atone" implies that the money must be returned first.</p>
<p class="bas indent1"><span class="nm">(d)</span><span class="cl">Question:</span> If so, you should also expound "aside from the morning Olah (Tamid offering)" to teach that the Musaf offering precedes the Tamid (but this is not so)!</p>
<p class="bas indent2"><span class="nm">1.</span><span class="cl">(Beraisa):</span> No Korban may be brought before the morning Tamid - "he will arrange on (the woodpile) the Olah".</p>
<p class="bas indent2"><span class="nm">2.</span><span class="cl">(Rava):</span> "The Olah" connotes the first Olah.</p>
<p class="bas indent1"><span class="nm">(e)</span><span class="cl">Answer (Rava):</span> I learn from "with which he will atone" - when he gives the money, the Asham has not yet been offered.</p>
<p class="bas indent1"><span class="nm">(f)</span><span class="cl">(Mishnah):</span> If he gave the principal...</p>
<p class="bas indent1"><span class="nm">(g)</span><span class="cl">(Beraisa) Question:</span> (If one transgressed Me'ilah,) what is the source that if he brought only the payment or Asham (but not both), he was not Yotzei?</p>
<p class="bas indent1"><span class="nm">(h)</span><span class="cl">Answer:</span> "With the ram of the Asham, he will be forgiven."</p>
<p class="bas indent1"><span class="nm">(i)</span><span class="cl">Question:</span> What is the source that if he brought the Asham before the payment, he was not Yotzei?</p>
<p class="bas indent1"><span class="nm">(j)</span><span class="cl">Answer:</span> "With the ram of the Asham (principal)" (implies that the principal was already brought).</p>
<p class="bas indent1"><span class="nm">(k)</span><span class="cl">Suggestion:</span> Perhaps just like if he omitted the ram or principal, he was not Yotzei, also if he did not pay the Chomesh!</p>
<p class="bas indent1"><span class="nm">(l)</span><span class="cl">Rejection:</span> "With the ram of the Asham, he will be forgiven" - the ram and principal are needed for atonement, but the Chomesh is not.</p>
<p class="bas indent1"><span class="nm">(m)</span>We learn about (one who stole from) Hekdesh from (one who stole from) a commoner (i.e. convert), and vice- versa.</p>
<p class="bas indent2"><span class="nm">1.</span>Just like regarding Gezel ha'Ger, "Asham" refers to principal, also regarding Me'ilah;</p>
<p class="bas indent2"><span class="nm">2.</span>Just like regarding Me'ilah, the Chomesh is not needed for atonement, also regarding Gezel ha'Ger.</p>

<p class="bas subject"><span class="nm">3)</span>TO WHOM DOES THE THEFT BELONG</p>
<p class="bas indent1"><span class="nm">(a)</span><span class="cl">(Mishnah):</span> If Reuven stole and fed the theft to his children or left it intact in front of them, and died, they are exempt from paying;</p>
<p class="bas indent2"><span class="nm">1.</span>If it was something with Achrayus (a lender can collect it from one who bought from the borrower, e.g. land), they are liable (this will be explained).</p>
<p class="bas indent1"><span class="nm">(b)</span><span class="cl">(Gemara - Rav Chisda):</span> If Shimon stole from Yehudah, and Yehudah did not despair of getting it back, and Levi came and ate it, Yehudah may collect from either one, whomever he wants.</p>
<p class="bas indent1"><span class="nm">(c)</span><span class="cl">Question:</span> What is the reason?</p>
<p class="bas indent1"><span class="nm">(d)</span><span class="cl">Answer:</span> As long as Yehudah did not despair, it belongs to him. (Also Levi stole from Yehudah.)</p>
<p class="bas indent1"><span class="nm">(e)</span><span class="cl">Question (Mishnah):</span> If Reuven stole and fed the theft to his children or left it intact in front of them, and died, they are exempt from paying.</p>
<p class="bas indent2"><span class="nm">1.</span>This refutes Rav Chisda. (He says that it still belongs to the owner!)</p>
<p class="bas indent1"><span class="nm">(f)</span><span class="cl">Answer (Rav Chisda):</span> The Mishnah discusses after the owner despaired.</p>
<p class="bas indent1"><span class="nm">(g)</span><span class="cl">Version #1 (Mishnah):</span> If he left it intact in front of them, they are exempt.</p>
<p class="bas indent1"><span class="nm">(h)</span><span class="cl">(Rami bar Chama):</span> This teaches that heirs are like buyers. (Inheritance is considered a change of Reshus (after there was despair), so they acquire, but their father did not acquire.)</p>
<p class="bas indent1"><span class="nm">(i)</span><span class="cl">(Rava):</span> Heirs are unlike buyers. The case is, they ate the theft.</p>
<p class="bas indent1"><span class="nm">(j)</span><span class="cl">Question (Seifa):</span> If it was something with Achrayus they are liable.</p>
<p class="bas indent2"><span class="nm">1.</span>This implies that in the Reisha, the theft is still around!</p>
<p class="bas indent1"><span class="nm">(k)</span><span class="cl">Answer (Rava):</span> The Seifa means that if their father left to them other property with Achrayus (i.e. land), they are liable.</p>
<p class="bas indent1"><span class="nm">(l)</span><span class="cl">Question:</span> Rebbi taught to his son R. Shimon that the Mishnah does not really mean land, rather, an animal that he works with;</p>
<p class="bas indent2"><span class="nm">1.</span>They must return for the sake of their father's honor (lest people see the animal and recall the theft).</p>
<p class="bas indent1"><span class="nm">(m)</span><span class="cl">Rava:</span> I explain the Mishnah like R. Oshiya's Beraisa;</p>
<p class="bas indent2"><span class="nm">1.</span><span class="cl">(R. Oshaya - Beraisa):</span> If Reuven stole and fed the theft to his children, they are exempt;</p>
<p class="bas indent2"><span class="nm">2.</span>If he left it intact in front of them, they are liable. If not, they are exempt;</p>
<p class="bas indent2"><span class="nm">3.</span>If he left them property with Achrayus, they are liable.</p>
<p class="bas indent1"><span class="nm">(n)</span><span class="cl">(R. Oshiya's Beraisa):</span> If the stolen object is not intact, they are exempt.</p>
<p class="bas indent1"><span class="nm">(o)</span><span class="cl">Question:</span> This refutes Rav Chisda!</p>
<p class="bas indent1"><span class="nm">(p)</span><span class="cl">Answer (Rav Chisda):</span> This is after the owner despaired.</p>
<p class="bas indent1"><span class="nm">(q)</span><span class="cl">(R. Oshiya's Beraisa):</span> If the stolen object is intact, they are liable.</p>
<p class="bas indent1"><span class="nm">(r)</span><span class="cl">Suggestion:</span> This refutes Rami bar Chama!</p>
<p class="bas indent1"><span class="nm">(s)</span><span class="cl">Answer (Rami bar Chama):</span> This is before the owner despaired.</p>
