<p class="bas indent1"><span class="nm">(a)</span><span class="cl">(Mishnah):</span> If one vowed...</p>
<p class="bas indent1"><span class="nm">(b)</span><span class="cl">Question:</span> Granted, forbidding her to go to banquet halls is a barrier in front of her (Simchah);</p>
<p class="bas indent2"><span class="nm">1.</span>Why is forbidding her to go to a house of mourning a barrier?</p>
<p class="bas indent1"><span class="nm">(c)</span><span class="cl">Answer (Beraisa) Version #1:</span> When she will die, no one will come to eulogize her.</p>
<p class="bas indent1"><span class="nm">(d)</span><span class="cl">Version #2:</span> When she will die, no one will come to bury her.</p>
<p class="bas indent1"><span class="nm">(e)</span><span class="cl">(Beraisa - R. Meir):</span> "It is better to go to the house of Aveilus than to the banquet hall, since it is the end of every man, and <i>the living will put to his heart</i>" - this refers to matters of death;</p>
<p class="bas indent2"><span class="nm">1.</span>One who eulogizes will be eulogized. One who buries will be buried. One who wails will be wailed over. One who accompanies a Mes will be accompanied. One who carries a Mes will be carried.</p>
<p class="bas indent1"><span class="nm">(f)</span><span class="cl">(Mishnah):</span> He may do so if he claims that this is due of another matter.</p>
<p class="bas indent1"><span class="nm">(g)</span><span class="cl">Question:</span> What is this other matter?</p>
<p class="bas indent1"><span class="nm">(h)</span><span class="cl">Answer (Rav Yehudah):</span> Licentious people are found there.</p>
<p class="bas indent2"><span class="nm">1.</span><span class="cl">(Rav Ashi):</span> This is only if they are known to be there. If not, he cannot forbid her.</p>
<p class="bas indent1"><span class="nm">(i)</span><span class="cl">(Mishnah):</span> If he says, on condition that you tell...</p>
<p class="bas indent1"><span class="nm">(j)</span><span class="cl">Question:</span> (Why must he divorce her and pay a Kesuvah?) She can tell!</p>
<p class="bas indent1"><span class="nm">(k)</span><span class="cl">Answer (Rav Yehudah):</span> He asked her to tell shameful things.</p>
<p class="bas indent1"><span class="nm">(l)</span><span class="cl">(Mishnah):</span> Or, you must fill...</p>
<p class="bas indent1"><span class="nm">(m)</span><span class="cl">Question:</span> (Why must he divorce her and pay a Kesuvah?) She can do this!</p>
<p class="bas indent1"><span class="nm">(n)</span><span class="cl">Answer #1 (Rav Yehudah):</span> He asked her to remove his semen after Bi'ah to prevent pregnancy.</p>
<p class="bas indent1"><span class="nm">(o)</span><span class="cl">Answer #2 (Beraisa):</span> He asked her to fill 10 jugs of water and spill them at the dumping site.</p>
<p class="bas indent1"><span class="nm">(p)</span><span class="cl">Question:</span> According to Rav Yehudah, we understand why he must divorce her and pay her Kesuvah;</p>
<p class="bas indent2"><span class="nm">1.</span>But according to the Beraisa, what difference does it make to her? She can do what he says!</p>
<p class="bas indent1"><span class="nm">(q)</span><span class="cl">Answer (Rabah bar bar Chanah):</span> It would make her appear like a lunatic.</p>
<p class="bas indent1"><span class="nm">(r)</span><span class="cl">(Rav Kahana):</span> If one vowed that his wife may not borrow nor lend a sifter, mill or oven he must divorce her and pay her Kesuvah, since this gives her a bad reputation among her neighbors.</p>
<p class="bas indent1"><span class="nm">(s)</span><span class="cl">Support (Beraisa):</span> If one vowed that his wife may not borrow nor lend a sifter, mill or oven he must divorce her and pay her Kesuvah, since this gives her a bad reputation among her neighbors;</p>
<p class="bas indent2"><span class="nm">1.</span>Similarly, if she vowed that she will not borrow nor lend a sifter, mill or oven, and will not weave nice clothes for his children, he may divorce her without paying her Kesuvah, since this gives him a bad reputation among his neighbors.</p>
<p class="bas subject"><span class="nm">2)</span>WOMEN WHO FORFEIT THEIR <i>KESUVOS</i></p>
<p class="bas indent1"><span class="nm">(a)</span><span class="cl">(Mishnah):</span> The following are divorced and do not receive a Kesuvah: one who transgresses Das Moshe (Torah law) or Das Yehudis (the ways of Benos Yisrael);</p>
<p class="bas indent2"><span class="nm">1.</span>Transgressing Das Moshe is feeding him untithed food, having Bi'ah with him when she is Nidah, not separating Chalah, or vowing and transgressing her vows;</p>
<p class="bas indent2"><span class="nm">2.</span>Transgressing Das Yehudis is going out with her head uncovered, spinning in the market, or talking with every man.</p>
<p class="bas indent2"><span class="nm">3.</span>Aba Sha'ul says, it is even one who curses his ancestors in front of him;</p>
<p class="bas indent2"><span class="nm">4.</span>R. Tarfon says, it is even a loud-voiced woman.</p>
<p class="bas indent3"><span class="nm">i.</span>This is one who can be heard by neighbors when she speaks in her house.</p>
<p class="bas indent1"><span class="nm">(b)</span><span class="cl">(Gemara) Question:</span> What is the case of feeding him untithed food?</p>
<p class="bas indent2"><span class="nm">1.</span>If he knows that it is untithed, he should not eat it!</p>
<p class="bas indent2"><span class="nm">2.</span>If he does not know that it is untithed, how does he know that she fed him untithed food?</p>
<p class="bas indent1"><span class="nm">(c)</span><span class="cl">Answer:</span> She said that Ploni separated the tithes. He asked Ploni, and found that she lied.</p>
<p class="bas indent1"><span class="nm">(d)</span><span class="cl">(Mishnah):</span> She has Bi'ah with him when she is Nidah.</p>
<p class="bas indent1"><span class="nm">(e)</span><span class="cl">Question:</span> What is the case?</p>
<p class="bas indent2"><span class="nm">1.</span>If he knows that she is Nidah, he should refrain!</p>
<p class="bas indent2"><span class="nm">2.</span>If he does not know that she is Nidah, he should believe her that she was not a Nidah!</p>
<p class="bas indent3"><span class="nm">i.</span><span class="cl">(Rav Chinena bar Kahana):</span> "She will count seven days" teaches that she counts to herself (and is believed).</p>
<p class="bas indent1"><span class="nm">(f)</span><span class="cl">Answer #1:</span> She said that Ploni declared that the blood she saw does not make her Nidah. He asked Ploni, and found that she lied.</p>
<p class="bas indent1"><span class="nm">(g)</span><span class="cl">Answer #2:</span> It is like Rav Yehudah taught:</p>
<p class="bas indent2"><span class="nm">1.</span><span class="cl">(Rav Yehudah):</span> If a woman was established to be a Nidah among her neighbors, her husband is lashed for having Bi'ah with her.</p>
<p class="bas indent1"><span class="nm">(h)</span><span class="cl">(Mishnah):</span> She does not separate Chalah.</p>
<p class="bas indent1"><span class="nm">(i)</span><span class="cl">Question:</span> What is the case?</p>
<p class="bas indent2"><span class="nm">1.</span>If he knows that it was not separated, he should not eat!</p>
<p class="bas indent2"><span class="nm">2.</span>If he does not know that it was not separated, how does he know that she did not separate?</p>
<p class="bas indent1"><span class="nm">(j)</span><span class="cl">Answer:</span> She said that Ploni the kneader separated the Chalah; he asked Ploni, and found that she lied.</p>
<p class="bas indent1"><span class="nm">(k)</span><span class="cl">(Mishnah):</span> She vows and transgresses her vows.</p>
<p class="bas indent1"><span class="nm">(l)</span>This is grounds to divorce her and not pay her Kesuvah, since children die due to vows of the parents.</p>
<p class="bas indent2"><span class="nm">1.</span>"Don't let your mouth diminish your flesh...(and destroy your handiwork)" - the handiwork of man is his children.</p>
<p class="bas indent2"><span class="nm">2.</span><span class="cl">(Rav Nachman):</span> "In vain I struck your children" - for matters of vain (oaths).</p>
<p class="bas indent1"><span class="nm">(m)</span><span class="cl">(Beraisa - R. Meir):</span> One who knows that his wife vows and transgresses her vows should impose vows on her.</p>
<p class="bas indent1"><span class="nm">(n)</span><span class="cl">Objection:</span> This will not help!</p>
<p class="bas indent1"><span class="nm">(o)</span><span class="cl">Correction:</span> Rather, he should anger her so she will vow in front of him and he can annul the vows;</p>
<p class="bas indent1"><span class="nm">(p)</span>Chachamim say, a man cannot live with a snake in a basket (he divorces her and does not pay a Kesuvah).</p>
<p class="bas indent1"><span class="nm">(q)</span><span class="cl">(Beraisa - R. Yehudah):</span> One who knows that his wife does not separate Chalah should separate it himself;</p>
<p class="bas indent1"><span class="nm">(r)</span>Chachamim say, a man cannot live with a snake in a basket.</p>
<p class="bas indent1"><span class="nm">(s)</span>R. Yehudah counsels to stay married to a wife who does not separate Chalah. All the more so, he counsels to keep a wife who transgresses her vows (like R. Meir, above);</p>
<p class="bas indent2"><span class="nm">1.</span>R. Meir counsels to keep a wife who transgresses her vows, but he would counsel divorcing one who doesn't separate Chalah, lest he forget and eat.</p>
<p class="bas subject"><span class="nm">3)</span>THE WAYS OF <i>BENOS</i> <i>YISRAEL</i></p>
<p class="bas indent1"><span class="nm">(a)</span><span class="cl">(Mishnah):</span> Das Yehudis... she goes out with her hair uncovered...</p>
<p class="bas indent1"><span class="nm">(b)</span><span class="cl">Question:</span> Uncovered hair is mid'Oraisa!</p>
<p class="bas indent2"><span class="nm">1.</span><span class="cl">(Tana d'Vei R. Yishmael):</span> "He will uncover her hair" warns (married) Benos Yisrael that they should not go out with uncovered hair.</p>
<p class="bas bbbline">72b----------------------------------------72b</p>
<p class="bas indent1"><span class="nm">(c)</span><span class="cl">Answer:</span> Mid'Oraisa, it suffices to have a basket on her head. This does not fulfill Das Yehudis.</p>
<p class="bas indent1"><span class="nm">(d)</span><span class="cl">(R. Asi):</span> A basket on the head is considered covered (even for Das Yehudis).</p>
<p class="bas indent1"><span class="nm">(e)</span><span class="cl">Question (R. Zeira):</span> Where is it sufficient?</p>
<p class="bas indent2"><span class="nm">1.</span>In the market this does not fulfill Das Yehudis!</p>
<p class="bas indent2"><span class="nm">2.</span><span class="cl">Suggestion:</span> It is considered covered in the courtyard.</p>
<p class="bas indent2"><span class="nm">3.</span><span class="cl">Rejection:</span> If she must cover her hair in the courtyard, no married Bas Yisrael can fulfill this!</p>
<p class="bas indent1"><span class="nm">(f)</span><span class="cl">Answer (Abaye):</span> It suffices in the alleyway between courtyards.</p>
<p class="bas indent1"><span class="nm">(g)</span><span class="cl">(Mishnah):</span> She spins in the market.</p>
<p class="bas indent1"><span class="nm">(h)</span><span class="cl">Opinion #1 (Rav Yehudah):</span> The case is, she reveals her arms to men.</p>
<p class="bas indent1"><span class="nm">(i)</span><span class="cl">Opinion #2 (Rav Chisda):</span> She spins with a thread dangling by her (Ervah, i.e. lower) 'face'.</p>
<p class="bas indent1"><span class="nm">(j)</span><span class="cl">(Mishnah):</span> She speaks with all men.</p>
<p class="bas indent1"><span class="nm">(k)</span><span class="cl">(Rav Yehudah):</span> She jokes with young men.</p>
<p class="bas indent2"><span class="nm">1.</span><span class="cl">(Rabah bar bar Chanah):</span> Rav Ukva saw an Araviya spinning, with a thread by her face. She threw her stick, and asked Rav Ukva to retrieve it. Rav Ukva made a remark.</p>
<p class="bas indent2"><span class="nm">2.</span><span class="cl">Ravina:</span> He said that this is spinning in the market.</p>
<p class="bas indent2"><span class="nm">3.</span><span class="cl">Rabanan:</span> He said that this is speaking with all men.</p>
<p class="bas indent1"><span class="nm">(l)</span><span class="cl">(Mishnah - Aba Sha'ul):</span> Even if she curses his ancestors in front of him...</p>
<p class="bas indent1"><span class="nm">(m)</span><span class="cl">(Rav Yehudah):</span> This is (even) if she curses his ancestors in front of his children.</p>
<p class="bas indent2"><span class="nm">1.</span>The Siman to remember this is "Efrayim and Menasheh will be like Reuven and Shimon to me." (Many explain that the Siman is from the continuation "U'Moladtecha Asher Holadta Achareihem Lecha Yiheyu..." Ritva - this shows that one's children are like himself. Gra (EH 115:13) - the verse shows that 'Moldav' refers to children, and Yoldav' refers to parents.)</p>
<p class="bas indent2"><span class="nm">2.</span><span class="cl">(Rabah):</span> In front of his son she says to him 'A lion should eat your father'.</p>
<p class="bas indent1"><span class="nm">(n)</span><span class="cl">(Mishnah):</span> R. Tarfon says, even a loud-voiced woman.</p>
<p class="bas indent1"><span class="nm">(o)</span><span class="cl">Question:</span> What is a loud-voiced woman?</p>
<p class="bas indent1"><span class="nm">(p)</span><span class="cl">Answer #1 (Rav Yehudah):</span> It is one who audibly asks for Bi'ah.</p>
<p class="bas indent1"><span class="nm">(q)</span><span class="cl">Answer #2 (Beraisa):</span> When she has Bi'ah in this courtyard, she can be heard in another courtyard.</p>
<p class="bas indent1"><span class="nm">(r)</span><span class="cl">Objection:</span> If so, this should be listed among Mumim (in the Mishnah 75a)!</p>
<p class="bas indent1"><span class="nm">(s)</span><span class="cl">Answer:</span> Rather, we must rely on the first answer.</p>
<p class="bas subject"><span class="nm">4)</span>MARRIAGE ON CONDITION</p>
<p class="bas indent1"><span class="nm">(a)</span><span class="cl">(Mishnah):</span> If a man was Mekadesh a woman on condition that she has no vows and she was found to have, she is not Mekudeshes;</p>
<p class="bas indent1"><span class="nm">(b)</span>If he did Nisu'in Stam (without specifying) and she was found to have vows, she leaves without a Kesuvah;</p>
<p class="bas indent1"><span class="nm">(c)</span>If he was Mekadesh on condition that she has no Mumim and she was found to have Mumim, she is not Mekudeshes;</p>
<p class="bas indent1"><span class="nm">(d)</span>If he did Nisu'in Stam and she is found to have Mumim, she leaves without a Kesuvah;</p>
<p class="bas indent1"><span class="nm">(e)</span>All Mumim that disqualify Kohanim are considered Mumim in a woman.</p>
<p class="bas indent1"><span class="nm">(f)</span><span class="cl">(Gemara) Question:</span> Why was this Mishnah repeated in Kidushin (20a)?</p>
<p class="bas indent1"><span class="nm">(g)</span><span class="cl">Answer:</span> It was taught here for the law of Kesuvos, and the law of Kidushin was added on. It was taught there for the law of Kidushin, and the law of Kesuvos was added on.</p>
<p class="bas indent1"><span class="nm">(h)</span><span class="cl">(R. Yochanan):</span> Our Mishnah discusses vows not eat meat, drink wine, or wear colored clothing.</p>
<p class="bas indent1"><span class="nm">(i)</span><span class="cl">Support (Beraisa):</span> The law applies to vows of affliction, i.e. not to eat meat, drink wine, or wear colored clothing.</p>
<p class="bas indent1"><span class="nm">(j)</span><span class="cl">Question (Rav Papa):</span> To which part of the Mishnah does this apply?</p>
<p class="bas indent2"><span class="nm">1.</span><span class="cl">Suggestion:</span> It applies to the Reisha (Kidushin on condition that she has no vows).</p>
<p class="bas indent2"><span class="nm">2.</span><span class="cl">Rejection:</span> If so, any vow invalidates the Kidushin!</p>
<p class="bas indent1"><span class="nm">(k)</span><span class="cl">Answer #1 (Rav Papa):</span> It applies to the Seifa (he (was Mekadesh and) did Nisu'in Stam. If she has one of these vows, she leaves without a Kesuvah.)</p>
<p class="bas indent1"><span class="nm">(l)</span><span class="cl">Answer #2 (Rav Ashi):</span> Really, it applies to the Reisha. His insistence (that she have no vows) applies only to things that people care about.</p>
