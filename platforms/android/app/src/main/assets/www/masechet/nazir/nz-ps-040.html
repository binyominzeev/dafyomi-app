<p class="bas subject"><span class="nm">1)</span>WHAT CONSTITUTES SHAVING? (cont.)</p>
<p class="bas indent1"><span class="nm">(a)</span><span class="cl">(Continuation of Beraisa - Rebbi):</span> You need not say so (that "Ta'ar" does not teach about the Isur, rather, about the Mitzvah to shave at the end. It teaches about both!)</p>
<p class="bas indent2"><span class="nm">1.</span>"A Ta'ar will not pass over his head until completion (of Nezirus." This forbids a Ta'ar. We also infer that) after completion, a Ta'ar will pass over, i.e. he must shave with a Ta'ar.</p>
<p class="bas indent1"><span class="nm">(b)</span><span class="cl">Question:</span> But it says "A Ta'ar will not pass over his head" (all forms of removing hair are forbidden)!</p>
<p class="bas indent1"><span class="nm">(c)</span><span class="cl">Answer:</span> "Ta'ar" teaches that if he shaves with a Ta'ar, he transgresses two Isurim.</p>
<p class="bas subject"><span class="nm">2)</span>THE QUANTITY OF SHAVING</p>
<p class="bas indent1"><span class="nm">(a)</span><span class="cl">(Rav Chisda):</span> One is lashed for shaving even one hair. Two unshaven hairs invalidate the Mitzvah of shaving (upon completion of Nezirus). If one shaved during Nezirus, he is Soser (nullifies days counted) only if he shaved the majority of his head. This (lashes) is only with a Ta'ar.</p>
<p class="bas indent1"><span class="nm">(b)</span><span class="cl">Question:</span> The Beraisa says that one is liable for any method of removing hair!</p>
<p class="bas indent1"><span class="nm">(c)</span><span class="cl">Answer:</span> Rather, Rav Chisda meant that one is liable only for shaving <i>like</i> with a Ta'ar (totally removing the hairs).</p>
<p class="bas indent1"><span class="nm">(d)</span><span class="cl">Support (regarding Stirah - Beraisa):</span> If a Nazir pulled out any amount of hairs or parts of hairs, he is (Rosh's text - liable. He is) Soser only if he removed most of the hairs of his head with a Ta'ar; (According to the Rosh, this also supports Rav Chisda regarding lashes.)</p>
<p class="bas indent1"><span class="nm">(e)</span>R. Shimon says, just like two remaining hairs invalidate the Mitzvah of shaving (at the end), two hairs shaved during Nezirus are Soser.</p>
<p class="bas subject"><span class="nm">3)</span>THE MITZVAH OF SHAVING</p>
<p class="bas indent1"><span class="nm">(a)</span><span class="cl">(Mishnah):</span> Three people have a Mitzvah to shave: a Nazir, a Metzora, and Leviyim (at the time they were chosen to serve the Mishkan);</p>
<p class="bas indent2"><span class="nm">1.</span>All three must shave with a Ta'ar. Two remaining hairs invalidate the Mitzvah.</p>
<p class="bas indent1"><span class="nm">(b)</span><span class="cl">Question:</span> The Torah explicitly says that they must shave! (Why did the Mishnah need to teach this?)</p>
<p class="bas indent1"><span class="nm">(c)</span><span class="cl">Answer:</span> One might have thought that the Mitzvah is to remove the hair, and even a cream that makes hair fall out suffices. The Mishnah teaches that this is not so.</p>
<p class="bas indent1"><span class="nm">(d)</span><span class="cl">(Mishnah):</span> They must shave with a Ta'ar.</p>
<p class="bas indent1"><span class="nm">(e)</span><span class="cl">Question:</span> We understand regarding a Nazir. It says "A Ta'ar will not pass over his head (until completion"; after completion, a Ta'ar will pass);</p>
<p class="bas indent2"><span class="nm">1.</span>Regarding Leviyim it says, "They will pass a Ta'ar over all their flesh."</p>
<p class="bas indent1"><span class="nm">(f)</span><span class="cl">Question:</span> What is the source that a Metzora must shave with a Ta'ar?</p>
<p class="bas indent2"><span class="nm">1.</span><span class="cl">Suggestion:</span> Just like Tiglachas of Leviyim required a Ta'ar, also of Metzora'im.</p>
<p class="bas indent2"><span class="nm">2.</span><span class="cl">Rejection:</span> The Torah required the bodies of the Leviyim to be waved, but not of Metzora'im. Perhaps it is also more stringent about Tiglachas of Leviyim!</p>
<p class="bas indent2"><span class="nm">3.</span><span class="cl">Suggestion:</span> We learn from a Nazir.</p>
<p class="bas indent2"><span class="nm">4.</span><span class="cl">Rejection:</span> A Nazir brings breads with his Korban, unlike a Metzora. Perhaps Tiglachas Nazir is also more stringent than of a Metzora.</p>
<p class="bas indent1"><span class="nm">(g)</span><span class="cl">Answer:</span> We learn from both of them.</p>
<p class="bas indent1"><span class="nm">(h)</span>We cannot learn from Leviyim alone. Since Leviyim needed to be waved, perhaps their Tiglachas is more stringent;</p>
<p class="bas indent2"><span class="nm">1.</span>We learn from Nazir that Tiglachas with a Ta'ar applies even when the person need not be waved.</p>
<p class="bas indent2"><span class="nm">2.</span><span class="cl">Objection:</span> We cannot learn from a Nazir, because his Korban requires bread!</p>
<p class="bas indent2"><span class="nm">3.</span><span class="cl">Answer:</span> Leviyim required a Ta'ar, even though they did not bring bread!</p>
<p class="bas indent2"><span class="nm">4.</span>The stringencies of Leviyim and Nezirim are different. The Tzad ha'Shavah (what is common to both) is that they must shave, and it must be with a Ta'ar. Also Metzora'im must shave; we learn that also they require a Ta'ar!</p>
<p class="bas indent1"><span class="nm">(i)</span><span class="cl">Rejection (Rava of Barnish):</span> The Torah did not specify a cheaper Korban for poor Leviyim or Nezirim. We cannot learn to Metzora'im, for a poor Metzora brings a cheaper Korban!</p>
<p class="bas bbbline">40b----------------------------------------40b</p>
<p class="bas indent1"><span class="nm">(j)</span><span class="cl">Question (Rava bar Mesharshiya):</span> The Tana first said (end of 39b) that we cannot learn that a Nazir must shave with a Ta'ar from a Metzora, since a Metzora is more stringent (apparently, he had an independent source for Metzora);</p>
<p class="bas indent2"><span class="nm">1.</span>Later, the Tana (40a) tries (and fails) to learn a Metzora from a Nazir!</p>
<p class="bas indent1"><span class="nm">(k)</span><span class="cl">Answer (Rava):</span> The former is like Chachamim; the latter is like R. Eliezer (as follows).</p>
<p class="bas subject"><span class="nm">4)</span>THE <i>ISUR</i> OF SHAVING</p>
<p class="bas indent1"><span class="nm">(a)</span><span class="cl">(Mishnah):</span> One is liable (for shaving his beard) only with a Ta'ar;</p>
<p class="bas indent1"><span class="nm">(b)</span>R. Eliezer says, he is liable even with Melaket or Rehitani (tweezers or planing tools).</p>
<p class="bas indent1"><span class="nm">(c)</span><span class="cl">Question:</span> What is the source of Chachamim?</p>
<p class="bas indent1"><span class="nm">(d)</span><span class="cl">Answer (Beraisa) Suggestion:</span> Perhaps "(Kohanim) will not shave the corners of their beards" applies even to a Metzora!</p>
<p class="bas indent2"><span class="nm">1.</span><span class="cl">Rejection:</span> "(A Metzora will shave) Zekano" (even if he is a Kohen).</p>
<p class="bas indent1"><span class="nm">(e)</span><span class="cl">Question:</span> How do we know that a Metzora must shave with a Ta'ar?</p>
<p class="bas indent1"><span class="nm">(f)</span><span class="cl">Answer (Beraisa) Suggestion:</span> "(Kohanim) will not shave the corners of their beards" - Perhaps a Kohen is liable even if he shaves with scissors!</p>
<p class="bas indent2"><span class="nm">1.</span><span class="cl">Rejection:</span> "V'Lo Sashchis (totally cut off hairs)."</p>
<p class="bas indent2"><span class="nm">2.</span><span class="cl">Suggestion:</span> Perhaps one is liable even with a Melaket or Rehitani!</p>
<p class="bas indent2"><span class="nm">3.</span><span class="cl">Rejection:</span> "Lo Yegalechu (they will not shave)."</p>
<p class="bas indent2"><span class="nm">4.</span>The Torah forbids shaving with Hashchasah, namely, with a Ta'ar. (Rambam - Melaket and Rehitani are both kinds of tweezers. Tosfos - they are planing tools. This is Hashchasah, but since people do not normally shave with them, this is not called Gilu'ach.)</p>
<p class="bas indent1"><span class="nm">(g)</span><span class="cl">Question:</span> Perhaps the Isur is only with a Ta'ar, but a Metzora can also fulfill his Mitzvah with a Melaket or Rehitani, and "Zekano" permits him to shave with a Ta'ar!</p>
<p class="bas indent1"><span class="nm">(h)</span><span class="cl">Answer #1:</span> If he fulfilled his Mitzvah with Melaket or Rehitani, no verse would be needed to permit a Ta'ar!</p>
<p class="bas indent2"><span class="nm">1.</span>It is forbidden to become a Nazir, but even so a Nazir's Mitzvah to shave overrides the Isur to cut the Pe'os (sideburns). A Metzora did not sin, all the more so his Mitzvah to shave overrides the Isur to shave the beard (with a Ta'ar)!</p>
