<div class="subject"><span class="nm">1)</span><p>DO OTHER ISURIM BECOME BATEL?</p></div>
<div class="indent1"><span class="nm">(a)</span><p><span class="cl">Question:</span> Why don't we learn to other Kodshim?</p></div>
<div class="indent1"><span class="nm">(b)</span><p><span class="cl">Answer:</span> Regarding Chatas it says "whatever touches its flesh will become forbidden" - the other food becomes like the Chatas (even if it absorbed only a tiny amount).</p></div>
<div class="indent2"><span class="nm">1.</span><p>If the Chatas was Pasul, the other food may not be eaten. If it was Kosher, the food has all the stringencies of a Chatas. (It may be eaten only by Tahor male Kohanim in the Mikdash until morning.)</p></div>
<div class="indent1"><span class="nm">(c)</span><p><span class="cl">Question:</span> Why do we learn from a Chatas, and not from the Zero'a?</p></div>
<div class="indent1"><span class="nm">(d)</span><p><span class="cl">Answer:</span> The Zero'a is a Chidush, so we may not learn from it.</p></div>
<div class="indent1"><span class="nm">(e)</span><p><span class="cl">Question:</span> If so, we should not learn that 60 or 100 parts are needed for Bitul!</p></div>
<div class="indent1"><span class="nm">(f)</span><p><span class="cl">Answer:</span> We may not learn leniencies from a Chidush, but we may learn stringencies;</p></div>
<div class="indent2"><span class="nm">1.</span><p>Mid'Oraisa, a minority is Batel in any majority!</p></div>
<div class="indent1"><span class="nm">(g)</span><p><span class="cl">Answer #3 (to Question 3:a, 98b - Ravina):</span> The place where Zero'a is cut (towards the body) is permitted. If any other Isur (Tosfos - of Chulin), was cut off, we may not eat the place of the cut.</p></div>
<div class="subject"><span class="nm">2)</span><p>THE QUANTITY REQUIRED TO BE MEVATEL ISURIM</p></div>
<div class="indent1"><span class="nm">(a)</span><p><span class="cl">Question (against Rav Shmuel bar Yitzchak - Abaye):</span> Is it really true that Isurim are Batel in 100?!</p></div>
<div class="indent2"><span class="nm">1.</span><p><span class="cl">(Mishnah):</span> If Terumah fermented or seasoned Chulin or was cooked with Chulin:</p></div>
<div class="indent3"><span class="nm">i.</span><p>If it is Min b'Mino, we are always stringent;</p></div>
<div class="indent3"><span class="nm">ii.</span><p>If it is Min b'Eino Mino, we are sometimes lenient, and sometimes stringent.</p></div>
<div class="indent2"><span class="nm">2.</span><p><span class="cl">(Seifa):</span> An example of Min b'Eino Mino is when Terumah beans were cooked with Chulin lentils:</p></div>
<div class="indent3"><span class="nm">i.</span><p>If the beans gave Ta'am to the lentils, whether or not there is 101 (times as much mixture as beans), the lentils must be eaten like Terumah.</p></div>
<div class="indent3"><span class="nm">ii.</span><p>If the beans didn't give Ta'am, whether or not there is 101, the lentils are like Chulin.</p></div>
<div class="indent3"><span class="nm">iii.</span><p><span class="cl">Suggestion:</span> 'Whether or not there is 101' means that 60 suffices to be Mevatel!</p></div>
<div class="bbbline">99b----------------------------------------99b</p></div>
<div class="indent1"><span class="nm">(b)</span><p><span class="cl">Answer (Rav Dimi):</span> No, there is 100.</p></div>
<div class="indent1"><span class="nm">(c)</span><p><span class="cl">Question:</span> The Reisha discusses 100. This implies that the Seifa discusses something else, i.e. 60!</p></div>
<div class="indent2"><span class="nm">1.</span><p><span class="cl">(Reisha):</span> Min b'Mino, we are always stringent;</p></div>
<div class="indent3"><span class="nm">i.</span><p>If Se'or (sourdough, used to ferment) of (Terumah) wheat fell into a dough of wheat, and it is large enough to ferment it, whether or not there is 101, we must treat the dough like Terumah;</p></div>
<div class="indent3"><span class="nm">ii.</span><p>If we do not have 101 times more, whether or not the Se'or is enough to ferment the dough, we must treat the dough like Terumah.</p></div>
<div class="indent2"><span class="nm">2.</span><p><span class="cl">(Summation of question):</span> You cannot say that the entire Mishnah discusses 100 (parts of Heter, i.e. 101 parts of mixture per part of Isur?! If so, Min b'Mino is just like Min b'Eino Mino!)</p></div>
<div class="indent1"><span class="nm">(d)</span><p><span class="cl">Answer:</span> No, the Reisha discusses 101 parts of Heter, and the Seifa discusses 101 parts of mixture.</p></div>
<div class="indent1"><span class="nm">(e)</span><p><span class="cl">Question:</span> When the Se'or is able to ferment the dough, why don't 101 parts of dough Mevatel it?</p></div>
<div class="indent1"><span class="nm">(f)</span><p>Rav Dimi had no answer.</p></div>
<div class="indent1"><span class="nm">(g)</span><p><span class="cl">Answer (Abaye):</span> Perhaps Se'or is more stringent, because it is a potent fermenting agent.</p></div>
<div class="indent1"><span class="nm">(h)</span><p><span class="cl">Support (Rav Dimi):</span> R. Yosi bar Chanina taught that the quantities needed to be Mevatel different foods varies:</p></div>
<div class="indent2"><span class="nm">1.</span><p>Fish brine requires 192 parts of Heter.</p></div>
<div class="indent3"><span class="nm">i.</span><p><span class="cl">(Mishnah):</span> The brine of Tamei fish is forbidden;</p></div>
<div class="indent3"><span class="nm">ii.</span><p>R. Yehudah says, one Revi'is forbids a mixture of two Sa'im (192 Reviyos).</p></div>
<div class="indent3"><span class="nm">iii.</span><p><span class="cl">Question:</span> R. Yehudah holds that Min b'Mino is never Batel!</p></div>
<div class="indent3"><span class="nm">iv.</span><p><span class="cl">Answer:</span> Brine is an exception, for it is a mere Zei'ah (sweat. Tosfos - it is forbidden only mid'Rabanan. Ramban - alternatively, it is a Chidush that the Torah forbids it. The Torah was not stringent to forbid if it is mixed b'Mino in a majority of Heter.)</p></div>
<div class="subject"><span class="nm">3)</span><p>TA'AM OF THE GID HA'NASHEH</p></div>
<div class="indent1"><span class="nm">(a)</span><p><span class="cl">(Mishnah):</span> How do we estimate...</p></div>
<div class="indent1"><span class="nm">(b)</span><p><span class="cl">(Rav Huna):</span> We see if meat (equal in volume to the Gid) would give taste to heads (Tosfos - roots) of turnips (equal in volume to the thigh it was cooked with).</p></div>
<div class="indent1"><span class="nm">(c)</span><p>Our Mishnah is unlike the following Tana:</p></div>
<div class="indent2"><span class="nm">1.</span><p><span class="cl">(Beraisa - R. Yishmael, son of R. Yochanan ben Brokah):</span> The Gid ha'Nasheh has no Ta'am.</p></div>
<div class="indent1"><span class="nm">(d)</span><p>A man asked R. Chanina about a food cooked with the Gid. He permitted it. R. Yehudah bar Zevina was standing outside. He told the man to ask again.</p></div>
<div class="indent2"><span class="nm">1.</span><p><span class="cl">R. Chanina:</span> Whoever told you to ask again, tell him that the Gid has no Ta'am.</p></div>
<div class="indent1"><span class="nm">(e)</span><p>When people asked R. Ami about such cases, he would send them to R. Yitzchak ben Chalov, who permits like R. Yehoshua ben Levi;</p></div>
<div class="indent2"><span class="nm">1.</span><p>R. Ami himself held that it has Ta'am and forbids (but he did not want to rule against R. Yehoshua ben Levi).</p></div>
<div class="indent1"><span class="nm">(f)</span><p>The Halachah is, the Gid has no Ta'am.</p></div>
<div class="indent1"><span class="nm">(g)</span><p><span class="cl">(Mishnah):</span> If a Gid ha'Nasheh was cooked with other Gidim...  (if we cannot recognize the Gid ha'Nasheh, they are all forbidden).</p></div>
<div class="indent1"><span class="nm">(h)</span><p><span class="cl">Question:</span> It should be Batel in the majority!</p></div>
<div class="indent1"><span class="nm">(i)</span><p><span class="cl">Answer:</span> It is a Briyah, so it is never Batel.</p></div>
