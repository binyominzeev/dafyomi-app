<p class="bas subject"><span class="nm">1)</span>THE TIME FOR SAYING <i>KERI'AS SHEMA</i></p>
<p class="bas indent1"><span class="nm">(a)</span><span class="cl">(Mishnah) Question:</span> When do we say Keri'as Shema at night?</p>
<p class="bas indent1"><span class="nm">(b)</span><span class="cl">Answer #1 (R. Eliezer):</span> The Mitzvah is from the time at which Kohanim may eat Terumah until the end of the first Mishmar (these will be explained).</p>
<p class="bas indent1"><span class="nm">(c)</span><span class="cl">Answer #2 (Chachamim):</span> The time extends until midnight.</p>
<p class="bas indent1"><span class="nm">(d)</span><span class="cl">Answer #3 (R. Gamliel):</span> The time extends until dawn.</p>
<p class="bas indent1"><span class="nm">(e)</span><span class="cl">A case occurred:</span> R. Gamliel's sons came home from a wedding after midnight (they had not said Shema).</p>
<p class="bas indent2"><span class="nm">1.</span><span class="cl">R. Gamliel:</span> You are obligated to say it now;</p>
<p class="bas indent2"><span class="nm">2.</span>In fact, wherever Chachamim said "until midnight," the Mitzvah (mid'Oraisa) is until dawn:</p>
<p class="bas indent3"><span class="nm">i.</span>Chelev (of Korbanos) and limbs (of an Olah) may be burned on the Mizbe'ach until dawn;</p>
<p class="bas indent3"><span class="nm">ii.</span>Any Korban that may be eaten for one day and a night is permitted until dawn.</p>
<p class="bas indent2"><span class="nm">3.</span><span class="cl">Question:</span> If so, why did Chachamim say, "until midnight"?</p>
<p class="bas indent2"><span class="nm">4.</span><span class="cl">Answer:</span> This is to distance people from transgression (lest dawn arrive before one performs the Mitzvah).</p>
<p class="bas indent1"><span class="nm">(f)</span><span class="cl">(Gemara) Question #1:</span> It is unreasonable to ask about the time of Keri'as Shema before teaching that it is a Mitzvah! What is the Tana's source for the obligation to recite Shema?</p>
<p class="bas indent1"><span class="nm">(g)</span><span class="cl">Question #2:</span> Why does the Tana first ask about the time for the nighttime Shema? He should first ask about the time for the morning Shema! (We find that the Torah teaches about the morning Tamid before the afternoon Tamid.)</p>
<p class="bas indent1"><span class="nm">(h)</span><span class="cl">Answer #1 (to both questions):</span> The Tana expounds the verse, "uv''Shochbecha uv''Kumecha." Therefore, he first asks about the time of Shechivah (going to sleep).</p>
<p class="bas indent1"><span class="nm">(i)</span><span class="cl">Answer #2 (to Question #2):</span> He learns from creation of the world that night comes first, as it says, "va'Yehi Erev va'Yehi Voker Yom Echad."</p>
<p class="bas indent1"><span class="nm">(j)</span><span class="cl">Question (Mishnah):</span> In the morning, there are two Berachos before Shema and one after; at night, there are two Berachos before and two after.</p>
<p class="bas indent2"><span class="nm">1.</span>According to both answers, the Tana should teach about the Berachos of the nighttime Shema first!</p>
<p class="bas indent1"><span class="nm">(k)</span><span class="cl">Answer:</span> The Tana begins our Mishnah with the nighttime Shema and concludes with the morning Shema; once he discusses the morning Shema, he teaches all its laws, then returns to discuss the nighttime Shema.</p>
<p class="bas subject"><span class="nm">2)</span>WHEN <i>KOHANIM</i> MAY EAT <i>TERUMAH</i></p>
<p class="bas indent1"><span class="nm">(a)</span><span class="cl">(Mishnah - R. Eliezer):</span> The Mitzvah is from when Kohanim may eat Terumah...</p>
<p class="bas indent1"><span class="nm">(b)</span>(The time Kohanim may eat Terumah always refers to a Kohen who was Tamei and immersed; he is a Tevul Yom and may not even touch Terumah until night.)</p>
<p class="bas indent1"><span class="nm">(c)</span><span class="cl">Question:</span> Kohanim may eat at Tzeis ha'Kochavim (when stars become visible at night) -- the Mishnah should say this explicitly!</p>
<p class="bas indent1"><span class="nm">(d)</span><span class="cl">Answer:</span> The Tana taught the time of Shema indirectly, in order to teach as well that Kohanim may eat Terumah at Tzeis ha'Kochavim;</p>
<p class="bas indent2"><span class="nm">1.</span>One might have thought that the Heter for a Mechusar Kipurim (one who must bring Korbanos to finish his Taharah, e.g. a Zav) to eat Terumah comes [during the day], when he brings the Korbanos. The Mishnah teaches that this is not so; the Heter is the night after he immerses, before bringing the Korbanos.</p>
<p class="bas indent2"><span class="nm">2.</span><span class="cl">(Beraisa):</span> "u'Va ha'Shemesh v'Taher" -- the setting of the sun is required before he can eat Terumah; the Korban is not required.</p>
<p class="bas indent2"><span class="nm">3.</span><span class="cl">Version #1 (Rashi) Question:</span> How does the Tana know that "u'Va ha'Shemesh" refers to the setting of the sun, and "v'Taher" refers to completion of the day?</p>
<p class="bas bbbline">2b----------------------------------------2b</p>
<p class="bas indent3"><span class="nm">i.</span>Perhaps "u'Va ha'Shemesh" refers to the rising of the sun (the day after immersion), and "v'Taher" refers to the person (who completes his Taharah by bringing Korbanos)!</p>
<p class="bas indent1"><span class="nm">(e)</span><span class="cl">Version #2 (Tosfos) Question:</span> How do we know that "u'Va ha'Shemesh" refers to Tzeis ha'Kochavim, and "v'Taher" refers to completion of the day?</p>
<p class="bas indent2"><span class="nm">1.</span>Perhaps "u'Va ha'Shemesh" refers to sundown, and "v'Taher" refers to the person (whose Taharah is complete, even though it is still day)! (End of Version #2)</p>
<p class="bas indent2"><span class="nm">2.</span><span class="cl">Answer (Rabah bar Rav Shila):</span> If so, the Torah would have said "va'Yetaher" (to show clearly that it refers to the person);</p>
<p class="bas indent3"><span class="nm">i.</span>Rather, it says "v'Taher" to refer to the day; this is like people say, "The sun went down and the day is finished."</p>
<p class="bas indent1"><span class="nm">(f)</span>In Eretz Yisrael, they did not hear Rabah's teaching, and thus they had a question.</p>
<p class="bas indent1"><span class="nm">(g)</span><span class="cl">Question:</span> Does "u'Va ha'Shemesh" refer to Tzeis ha'Kochavim, and "v'Taher" to the completion of the day, or does "u'Va ha'Shemesh" refer to sunset (Tosfos; Rashi - sunrise), and "v'Taher" to the person?</p>
<p class="bas indent1"><span class="nm">(h)</span><span class="cl">Answer (Beraisa):</span> A sign [of when Kohanim may eat] is Tzeis ha'Kochavim.</p>
<p class="bas indent2"><span class="nm">1.</span>This shows that the verse refers to Tzeis ha'Kochavim and the completion of the day.</p>
<p class="bas subject"><span class="nm">3)</span>THE EARLIEST TIME FOR THE NIGHTTIME <i>SHEMA</i></p>
<p class="bas indent1"><span class="nm">(a)</span><span class="cl">(Mishnah - R. Eliezer):</span> The Mitzvah [of Shema] is from the time at which Kohanim may eat Terumah.</p>
<p class="bas indent1"><span class="nm">(b)</span><span class="cl">Contradiction (Beraisa #1):</span> Question: When do we say Keri'as Shema at night?</p>
<p class="bas indent2"><span class="nm">1.</span><span class="cl">Answer:</span> The Mitzvah is from when an Ani (a poor person, who eats without the light of a lamp) begins to eat bread with salt, until he finishes his meal.</p>
<p class="bas indent2"><span class="nm">2.</span>Surely, the Beraisa argues [with all opinions in our Mishnah] about the latest time for Shema (an Ani's meal does not last four hours);</p>
<p class="bas indent3"><span class="nm">i.</span>Must we say that it also argues about the earliest time for Shema?</p>
<p class="bas indent1"><span class="nm">(c)</span><span class="cl">Answer:</span> No, the times of an Ani (when he eats) and Kohen (when he may eat Terumah) are the same.</p>
<p class="bas indent1"><span class="nm">(d)</span><span class="cl">Contradiction (Beraisa #2):</span> Question: From when may we say Shema at night?</p>
<p class="bas indent2"><span class="nm">1.</span><span class="cl">Answer #1 (R. Meir):</span> The Mitzvah begins when people begin to eat bread on Shabbos night (which is early, since everything is already prepared);</p>
<p class="bas indent2"><span class="nm">2.</span><span class="cl">Answer #2 (Chachamim):</span> It is from when Kohanim may eat Terumah; a sign for this time is Tzeis ha'Kochavim;</p>
<p class="bas indent3"><span class="nm">i.</span>A support for this, but not a proof, is the verse, "va'Anachnu Osim ba'Melachah... me'Alos ha'Shachar Ad Tzeis ha'Kochavim" (people work from dawn until nightfall);</p>
<p class="bas indent3"><span class="nm">ii.</span>It also says, "v'Hayu Lanu ha'Lailah Mishmar veha'Yom Melachah."</p>
<p class="bas indent3"><span class="nm">iii.</span><span class="cl">Question:</span> Why do we need the second verse?</p>
<p class="bas indent3"><span class="nm">iv.</span><span class="cl">Answer:</span> One might have thought that night begins before Tzeis ha'Kochavim (and day begins after dawn), and they were working more than usual (to build the Beis ha'Mikdash). The second verse shows that this is not so.</p>
<p class="bas indent2"><span class="nm">3.</span>We are thinking that an Ani eats at the same time as regular people [eat on Shabbos].</p>
<p class="bas indent2"><span class="nm">4.</span><span class="cl">Summation of question:</span> If the times of Ani and Kohen are the same, then Chachamim agree with R. Meir!</p>
<p class="bas indent3"><span class="nm">i.</span>Rather, we must say that they are different.</p>
<p class="bas indent1"><span class="nm">(e)</span><span class="cl">Answer:</span> Really, they are the same. The times of Ani and regular people are different.</p>
<p class="bas indent1"><span class="nm">(f)</span><span class="cl">Question:</span> The times of Ani and Kohen are not the same!</p>
<p class="bas indent2"><span class="nm">1.</span><span class="cl">(Beraisa #3) Question:</span> From when may we say Shema at night?</p>
<p class="bas indent2"><span class="nm">2.</span><span class="cl">Answer #1 (R. Eliezer):</span> The Mitzvah begins at Kidush ha'Yom (when the prohibitions of Shabbos take effect on Shabbos night, i.e. at Bein ha'Shemashos, which is Safek day, Safek night).</p>
<p class="bas indent2"><span class="nm">3.</span><span class="cl">Answer #2 (R. Yehoshua):</span> It begins when Kohanim may eat Terumah;</p>
<p class="bas indent2"><span class="nm">4.</span><span class="cl">Answer #3 (R. Meir):</span> It begins at the [latest] time [during the day] that Kohanim may immerse to eat Terumah [that night];</p>
<p class="bas indent2"><span class="nm">5.</span><span class="cl">Objection (R. Yehudah):</span> They must immerse during the day [while Shema must be said at night]!</p>
<p class="bas indent2"><span class="nm">6.</span><span class="cl">Answer #4 (R. Chanina):</span> It begins when an Ani comes in to eat bread with salt.</p>
<p class="bas indent2"><span class="nm">7.</span><span class="cl">Answer #5 (Rav Achai):</span> It begins when most people come in to eat.</p>
<p class="bas indent2"><span class="nm">8.</span><span class="cl">Summation of question:</span> If the times of Ani and Kohen are the same, then R. Yehoshua and R. Chanina say the same thing!</p>
<p class="bas indent3"><span class="nm">i.</span><span class="cl">Conclusion:</span> The times are different.</p>
<p class="bas indent1"><span class="nm">(g)</span><span class="cl">Question:</span> Which of them is the latest time?</p>
<p class="bas indent1"><span class="nm">(h)</span><span class="cl">Answer:</span> Presumably, Ani is latest, for if not, then R. Eliezer and R. Chanina say the same thing! (Surely an Ani does not stop working before Bein ha'Shemashos. Bein ha'Shemashos is shortly before Tzeis ha'Kochavim, so it is unreasonable that three Tana'im argue about times that are so close together!)</p>
<p class="bas indent1"><span class="nm">(i)</span><span class="cl">(Beraisa - R. Yehudah) Objection:</span> They must immerse during the day! (Bein ha'Shemashos extends for nine minutes; Kohanim must immerse before it starts, Shema is said when people go to sleep when it is definitely night, at least nine minutes later!)</p>
<p class="bas indent1"><span class="nm">(j)</span><span class="cl">Question:</span> This is a valid objection! (How can R. Meir answer it?)</p>
<p class="bas indent1"><span class="nm">(k)</span><span class="cl">Answer:</span> R. Meir disagrees with R. Yehudah's opinion of Bein ha'Shemashos, he holds like R. Yosi:</p>
<p class="bas indent2"><span class="nm">1.</span><span class="cl">(R. Yosi):</span> Bein ha'Shemashos is like an eye's wink -- the new day enters immediately after the previous day ends. (Therefore, Kohanim can immerse until nightfall, when people go to sleep.)</p>
<p class="bas indent1"><span class="nm">(l)</span><span class="cl">Question:</span> R. Meir (in Beraisos #2 and #3) contradicts himself!</p>
<p class="bas indent1"><span class="nm">(m)</span><span class="cl">Answer:</span> Tana'im argue about R. Meir's opinion.</p>
<p class="bas indent1"><span class="nm">(n)</span><span class="cl">Question:</span> R. Eliezer (in our Mishnah and Beraisa #3) contradicts himself!</p>
<p class="bas indent1"><span class="nm">(o)</span><span class="cl">Answer #1:</span> Tana'im argue about R. Eliezer's opinion.</p>
<p class="bas indent1"><span class="nm">(p)</span><span class="cl">Answer #2:</span> In our Mishnah, R. Eliezer teaches only about the latest time for Shema; the earliest time is according to the [anonymous] first Tana.</p>
