<div class="subject"><span class="nm">1)</span><p>WHEN IS CHAMETZ A CHATZITZAH? (CONT.)</p></div>
<div class="indent1"><span class="nm">(a)</span><p><span class="cl">Answer #2 (Abaye):</span> It means, the same applies to joining for the Shi'ur of Tum'ah during Pesach;</p></div>
<div class="indent2"><span class="nm">1.</span><p>During the rest of the year, there is a distinction.</p></div>
<div class="indent1"><span class="nm">(b)</span><p><span class="cl">Question:</span> What is the case?</p></div>
<div class="indent1"><span class="nm">(c)</span><p><span class="cl">Answer:</span> Less than k'Beitzah of food touched the dough:</p></div>
<div class="indent2"><span class="nm">1.</span><p>During Pesach, the Isur of Chametz makes the dough significant, therefore it joins to comprise a Shi'ur;</p></div>
<div class="indent2"><span class="nm">2.</span><p>During the rest of the year, it depends on whether or not he is Makpid - if he is Makpid about it, it is a Chatzitzah; if he wants it to stay there, it is like part of the trough.</p></div>
<div class="indent1"><span class="nm">(d)</span><p><span class="cl">Objection (Rava):</span> The Mishnah does not discuss joining - it discusses a Chatzitzah!</p></div>
<div class="indent1"><span class="nm">(e)</span><p><span class="cl">Answer #3 (Rava):</span> It means, the same applies to being Metaher the trough.</p></div>
<div class="indent1"><span class="nm">(f)</span><p><span class="cl">Question:</span> What is the case?</p></div>
<div class="indent1"><span class="nm">(g)</span><p><span class="cl">Answer:</span> It became Tamei, and he wants to immerse it to Metaher it:</p></div>
<div class="indent2"><span class="nm">1.</span><p>During Pesach, the Isur makes the dough significant, therefore it is a Chatzitzah that invalidates immersion;</p></div>
<div class="indent2"><span class="nm">2.</span><p>During the rest of the year, it depends on whether or not he is Makpid - if he is Makpid about it, it is a Chatzitzah; if he wants it to stay there, it is like part of the trough.</p></div>
<div class="indent1"><span class="nm">(h)</span><p><span class="cl">Objection (Rav Papa):</span> The Mishnah does not discuss Taharah - it discusses Tum'ah!</p></div>
<div class="indent1"><span class="nm">(i)</span><p><span class="cl">Answer #4 (Rav Papa):</span> It means, the same applies to being Metamei the trough.</p></div>
<div class="indent1"><span class="nm">(j)</span><p><span class="cl">Question:</span> What is the case?</p></div>
<div class="indent1"><span class="nm">(k)</span><p><span class="cl">Answer:</span> A Sheretz touched the dough:</p></div>
<div class="indent2"><span class="nm">1.</span><p>During Pesach, the Isur makes the dough significant, therefore it is a Chatzitzah, and the trough is not Tamei;</p></div>
<div class="indent2"><span class="nm">2.</span><p>During the rest of the year, it depends on whether or not he is Makpid - if he is Makpid about it, it is a Chatzitzah; if he wants it to stay there, it is like part of the trough.</p></div>
<div class="subject"><span class="nm">2)</span><p>THE SHI'UR OF A MIL</p></div>
<div class="indent1"><span class="nm">(a)</span><p><span class="cl">(Mishnah):</span> If one has 'Cheresh' dough (one cannot tell whether or not it is Chametz; alternatively, it is as hard as Cheres (earthenware)) - if other dough that was kneaded at the same time became Chametz, the Cheresh dough is also forbidden.</p></div>
<div class="indent1"><span class="nm">(b)</span><p><span class="cl">(Gemara) Question:</span> If there is no other dough that was kneaded at the same time, what is the law?</p></div>
<div class="indent1"><span class="nm">(c)</span><p><span class="cl">Answer (R. Avahu):</span> If from the end (R. Chananel, Rambam; Ritva - beginning) of kneading enough time has elapsed to walk from the tower of Nuyna to Tiverya, a Mil (2000 Amos, about a kilometer - this is 18 or 22 and a half minutes - see note in Appendix for 93B.)</p></div>
<div class="indent1"><span class="nm">(d)</span><p><span class="cl">Question:</span> Why didn't he simply say 'the time to walk a Mil'?</p></div>
<div class="indent1"><span class="nm">(e)</span><p><span class="cl">Answer:</span> In passing, he teaches how much is a Mil.</p></div>
<div class="indent1"><span class="nm">(f)</span><p><span class="cl">Version #1 (R. Avahu):</span> One must walk [up to] four Mil for the following:</p></div>
<div class="indent2"><span class="nm">1.</span><p>To knead a dough b'Taharah (Rashi - one hired to do so must walk four Mil to immerse vessels without extra compensation; Tosfos - if one wants to knead dough, he must walk four Mil to get someone who can do so b'Taharah);</p></div>
<div class="indent2"><span class="nm">2.</span><p>To pray [with a Tzibur];</p></div>
<div class="indent2"><span class="nm">3.</span><p>To wash his hands [before eating].</p></div>
<div class="indent1"><span class="nm">(g)</span><p><span class="cl">Version #2 (Rav Nachman bar Yitzchak):</span> Eibo said this, not R. Avahu; he included a fourth case, tanning:</p></div>
<div class="indent2"><span class="nm">1.</span><p><span class="cl">(Mishnah):</span> [Soft hide is Mekabel Tum'as Ochlim -] if any non-human hide was tanned or trampled enough for tanning, it is Tahor.</p></div>
<div class="indent2"><span class="nm">2.</span><p><span class="cl">Question:</span> How long is enough for tanning?</p></div>
<div class="indent2"><span class="nm">3.</span><p><span class="cl">Answer (R. Yanai):</span> It is [the time to walk] four Mil.</p></div>
<div class="indent1"><span class="nm">(h)</span><p><span class="cl">(R. Yosi bar Chanina):</span> Four Mil is the Shi'ur in the direction one was going, but one need not backtrack even one Mil.</p></div>
<div class="indent1"><span class="nm">(i)</span><p><span class="cl">Inference (Rav Acha):</span> One must backtrack any amount less than one Mil.</p></div>
<div class="subject"><span class="nm">3)</span><p>HO'IL</p></div>
<div class="indent1"><span class="nm">(a)</span><p><span class="cl">(Mishnah) Question:</span> How may Reuven separate Chalah from a Tamei dough on Yom Tov [of Pesach? If he designates part of the dough to be Chalah, he may not bake it [it is not a need of Yom Tov, since no one may eat Tamei Chalah], and it will become Chametz!]</p></div>
<div class="indent1"><span class="nm">(b)</span><p><span class="cl">Answer #1 (R. Eliezer):</span> He does not specify which part is Chalah until it is baked.</p></div>
<div class="indent1"><span class="nm">(c)</span><p><span class="cl">Answer #2 (Ben Beseira):</span> He [designates part of the dough to be Chalah, and] puts it into cold water to impede Chimutz.</p></div>
<div class="bbbline">46b----------------------------------------46b</p></div>
<div class="indent1"><span class="nm">(d)</span><p><span class="cl">Answer #3 (R. Yehoshua):</span> He is not commanded Bal Yera'eh and Bal Yimatzei regarding this Chametz! He may leave it until Motza'ei Yom Tov - he is not concerned if it becomes Chametz.</p></div>
<div class="indent1"><span class="nm">(e)</span><p><span class="cl">(Gemara) Suggestion:</span> The Tana'im argue about whether or not Tovas Hana'ah (Reuven's right to choose to which Kohen he will give Chalah [or tithes] - a Kohen's mother would pay a small amount to Reuven to give it to her son) is k'Mamon (like a monetary stake in the Chalah):</p></div>
<div class="indent2"><span class="nm">1.</span><p>R. Eliezer holds that it is like money; R. Yehoshua holds that it is not like money [therefore, the Chalah is not Reuven's, so he is not commanded about it].</p></div>
<div class="indent1"><span class="nm">(f)</span><p><span class="cl">Rejection:</span> No, all agree that it is not like money - they argue about Ho'il (does the law depend on something that could happen):</p></div>
<div class="indent2"><span class="nm">1.</span><p>R. Eliezer says, Ho'il (since) one may annul his declaration of Chalah, and it reverts to be his, therefore it is considered his [even if he does not annul it. Ho'il would also allow baking Tamei dough that was already made Chalah - however, it is better to avoid relying on Ho'il.]</p></div>
<div class="indent2"><span class="nm">2.</span><p>R. Yehoshua does not say Ho'il.</p></div>
<div class="indent1"><span class="nm">(g)</span><p><span class="cl">(Rav Chisda):</span> If one bakes on Yom Tov for the sake of a weekday, he is lashed;</p></div>
<div class="indent1"><span class="nm">(h)</span><p><span class="cl">(Rabah):</span> He is not lashed.</p></div>
<div class="indent1"><span class="nm">(i)</span><p>Rav Chisda obligates lashes - we do not exempt Ho'il (since) if guests would come he could serve the food to them [and it turns out that he cooked for consumption on Yom Tov];</p></div>
<div class="indent1"><span class="nm">(j)</span><p>Rabah exempts - we say Ho'il.</p></div>
<div class="indent1"><span class="nm">(k)</span><p><span class="cl">Question (Rabah against Rav Chisda):</span> You do not say Ho'il - how may we cook on Yom Tov for Shabbos (when Yom Tov is on Erev Shabbos?)</p></div>
<div class="indent1"><span class="nm">(l)</span><p><span class="cl">Answer (Rav Chisda):</span> It is permitted through Eruv Tavshilim (one begins preparing for Shabbos before Yom Tov, and may prepare more on Yom Tov).</p></div>
<div class="indent1"><span class="nm">(m)</span><p><span class="cl">Question (Rabah):</span> Eruv Tavshilim [is mid'Rabanan, it] cannot permit an Isur mid'Oraisa!</p></div>
<div class="indent1"><span class="nm">(n)</span><p><span class="cl">Answer (Rav Chisda):</span> Mid'Oraisa, one may cook on Yom Tov for Shabbos - Chachamim decreed, lest people come to cook on Yom Tov for the sake of a weekday;</p></div>
<div class="indent2"><span class="nm">1.</span><p>Chachamim required Eruv Tavshilim to remind people that one may not cook freely on Yom Tov for the sake of other days.</p></div>
<div class="indent1"><span class="nm">(o)</span><p><span class="cl">Question (Rabah - Beraisa):</span> If an animal is about to die [on Yom Tov], one may slaughter it only if there is enough time to eat a k'Zayis roasted (this is the fastest way to cook) before night;</p></div>
<div class="indent2"><span class="nm">1.</span><p>It suffices that he could eat, even if he does not eat.</p></div>
<div class="indent2"><span class="nm">2.</span><p>According to me, Ho'il he could eat, he may slaughter;</p></div>
<div class="indent2"><span class="nm">3.</span><p>But you do not say Ho'il - if he will not eat, why may he slaughter?</p></div>
<div class="indent1"><span class="nm">(p)</span><p><span class="cl">Answer (Rav Chisda):</span> It is permitted lest he lose money [the animal will die without slaughter].</p></div>
<div class="indent1"><span class="nm">(q)</span><p><span class="cl">Objection (Rabah):</span> We do not permit an Isur mid'Oraisa to prevent a loss of money!</p></div>
<div class="indent1"><span class="nm">(r)</span><p><span class="cl">Answer (Rav Chisda):</span> To avoid losing money, he resolves to eat a k'Zayis before dark - this necessitates slaughtering.</p></div>
