<p class="bas subject"><span class="nm">1)</span>WHEN DOES IDOLATRY BECOME FORBIDDEN? (cont.)</p>
<p class="bas indent1"><span class="nm">(a)</span><span class="cl">Question (Beraisa):</span> ("Abed Te'abedun...") refers to Kelim used to serve idolatry.</p>
<p class="bas indent2"><span class="nm">1.</span>The verse says "Es Kol <i>ha'Mekomos</i>" (it does not refer to Kelim)!</p>
<p class="bas indent1"><span class="nm">(b)</span><span class="cl">Answer:</span> We do not need it to teach about the places, for they do not become forbidden - "Eloheihem <i>Al</i> he'Harim (their gods <i>on</i> the mountains)", but the mountains are not their gods;</p>
<p class="bas indent2"><span class="nm">1.</span>We use this to teach about Kelim. It teaches that idolatry of a Nochri is not forbidden until it is Ne'evad, idolatry of a Yisrael is forbidden immediately.</p>
<p class="bas indent1"><span class="nm">(c)</span><span class="cl">Question:</span> We said that the verse teaches about Kelim. How do we learn about idolatry itself?</p>
<p class="bas indent1"><span class="nm">(d)</span><span class="cl">Answer:</span> The verse continues "Asher Atem Yoreshim Osam Es Eloheihem." This equates their gods to Kelim;</p>
<p class="bas indent2"><span class="nm">1.</span>Just like Kelim are not forbidden until they are Ne'evad, also their gods.</p>
<p class="bas indent2"><span class="nm">2.</span>R. Akiva does not equate them, because "Es" separates the Kelim from the gods.</p>
<p class="bas indent1"><span class="nm">(e)</span><span class="cl">Question:</span> What is R. Yishmael's source that idolatry of a Yisrael is forbidden immediately?</p>
<p class="bas indent1"><span class="nm">(f)</span><span class="cl">Answer:</span> He deduces: since idolatry of a Nochri is not forbidden until it is Ne'evad, idolatry of a Yisrael is forbidden immediately.</p>
<p class="bas indent1"><span class="nm">(g)</span><span class="cl">Suggestion:</span> Perhaps idolatry of a Yisrael is never forbidden?</p>
<p class="bas indent1"><span class="nm">(h)</span><span class="cl">Rejection:</span> We know that it must be buried. Surely it is forbidden!</p>
<p class="bas indent1"><span class="nm">(i)</span><span class="cl">Suggestion:</span> Perhaps it has the same law as idolatry of a Nochri!</p>
<p class="bas indent1"><span class="nm">(j)</span><span class="cl">Rejection:</span> "V'Es Chataschem Asher Asisem Es ha'Egel" - from the time of Asiyah (making it), there is Chet (siin).</p>
<p class="bas indent1"><span class="nm">(k)</span><span class="cl">Suggestion:</span> Perhaps the one who made it sinned, but it is not forbidden until it is Ne'evad!</p>
<p class="bas indent1"><span class="nm">(l)</span><span class="cl">Rejection:</span> "Arur ha'Ish Asher Ya'aseh Fesel u'Masechah" - from the time he made it, he is cursed.</p>
<p class="bas indent1"><span class="nm">(m)</span><span class="cl">Suggestion:</span> Perhaps he is cursed, but it is not forbidden until it is Ne'evad!</p>
<p class="bas indent1"><span class="nm">(n)</span><span class="cl">Rejection:</span> It says "To'avas Hash-m."</p>
<p class="bas indent2"><span class="nm">1.</span>R. Akiva explains, it (is not an abomination. It) leads to an abomination.</p>
<p class="bas indent1"><span class="nm">(o)</span><span class="cl">Question:</span> What is R. Akiva's source that idolatry of a Nochri is forbidden immediately?</p>
<p class="bas indent1"><span class="nm">(p)</span><span class="cl">Answer (Ula):</span> "<i>Pesilei</i> Eloheihem Tisrefun ba'Esh" - from the time it was Nifsal (carved out), it is an Elil (idol, and it is forbidden).</p>
<p class="bas indent2"><span class="nm">1.</span>R. Yishmael uses this to teach Rav Yosef's law.</p>
<p class="bas indent2"><span class="nm">2.</span><span class="cl">(Rav Yosef):</span> A Nochri can be Mevatel his idolatry - "Pesilei Eloheihem Tisrefun ba'Esh." (This alludes to being <i>Posel</i> (Mevatel) his gods.)</p>
<p class="bas indent2"><span class="nm">3.</span>R. Akiva learns this like Shmuel does.</p>
<p class="bas indent3"><span class="nm">i.</span><span class="cl">Contradiction (Shmuel):</span> It says (at the end of that verse) "Lo Sachmod Kesef v'Zahav Aleihem" (you may not take them), and it says "v'Lakachta Lach"!</p>
<p class="bas indent3"><span class="nm">ii.</span><span class="cl">Resolution:</span> If he Paslo (carved it) to make an Eloha, Tisrefun ba'Esh (it is forbidden). If he was Posel his Eloha, "v'Lakachta Lach."</p>
<p class="bas indent1"><span class="nm">(q)</span><span class="cl">Question:</span> We explained how R. Akiva learned that idolatry of a Nochri is forbidden immediately;</p>
<p class="bas indent2"><span class="nm">1.</span>What is his source that idolatry of a Yisrael is not forbidden until it is Ne'evad?</p>
<p class="bas indent1"><span class="nm">(r)</span><span class="cl">Answer (Rav Yehudah):</span> "V'Sam ba'Saser" - it is not forbidden until he does with it things done ba'Seser (in seclusion, i.e. idolatry).</p>
<p class="bas indent2"><span class="nm">1.</span>R. Yishmael uses this to teach R. Yitzchak's law.</p>
<p class="bas indent2"><span class="nm">2.</span><span class="cl">(R. Yitzchak):</span> Idolatry of a Yisrael requires Genizah (burial) - "v'Sam ba'Saser."</p>
<p class="bas indent2"><span class="nm">3.</span>R. Akiva learns this like Rav Chisda does.</p>
<p class="bas indent3"><span class="nm">i.</span><span class="cl">(Rav Chisda):</span> Idolatry of a Yisrael requires Genizah - "Lo Sita Lecha Asherah Kol Etz Etzel Mizbach" - just like the Mizbe'ach requires Genizah, also idolatry of a Yisrael.</p>
<p class="bas indent2"><span class="nm">4.</span>R. Yishmael expounds that verse as Reish Lakish does.</p>
<p class="bas indent3"><span class="nm">i.</span><span class="cl">(Reish Lakish):</span> Appointing an unlearned judge is like planting an Asherah - it says "Shofetim v'Shoterim Titen Lecha", followed by "Lo Sita Lecha Asherah Kol Etz."</p>
<p class="bas indent3"><span class="nm">ii.</span><span class="cl">(Rav Ashi):</span> Appointing an unlearned judge when Chachamim are available is like planting an Asherah next to the Mizbe'ach. The verse continues "... Etzel Mizbach Hash-m."</p>
<p class="bas subject"><span class="nm">2)</span>FIXING BROKEN IDOLATRY</p>
<p class="bas indent1"><span class="nm">(a)</span><span class="cl">Question (Rav Hamnuna):</span> If one fixed a broken Keli used for idolatry, what is the law?</p>
<p class="bas indent2"><span class="nm">1.</span><span class="cl">Question:</span> Whose idolatry was it?</p>
<p class="bas indent3"><span class="nm">i.</span>If it was a Nochri's, all agree that Meshamshim (things used to serve idolatry) of a Nochri are not forbidden until they are used for idolatry! (He would not need to ask.)</p>
<p class="bas indent2"><span class="nm">2.</span><span class="cl">Answer:</span> It was a Yisrael's.</p>
<p class="bas indent2"><span class="nm">3.</span><span class="cl">Question:</span> According to whom does he ask?</p>
<p class="bas indent3"><span class="nm">i.</span><span class="cl">Suggestion:</span> He asks according to R. Akiva.</p>
<p class="bas indent3"><span class="nm">ii.</span><span class="cl">Rejection:</span> R. Akiva says that idolatry of a Yisrael is not forbidden until it is Ne'evad, and all the more so Meshamshim!</p>
<p class="bas indent2"><span class="nm">4.</span><span class="cl">Answer:</span> He asks according to R. Yishmael, who says that a Yisrael's idolatry is forbidden immediately.</p>
<p class="bas indent2"><span class="nm">5.</span><span class="cl">Essence of the question:</span> Do we learn Meshamshim (of a Yisrael) from Meshamshim (of a Nochri), and it is permitted until it is used for Avodah?</p>
<p class="bas indent3"><span class="nm">i.</span>Or, do we learn Meshamshim of a Yisrael from idolatry of a Yisrael, and it is forbidden immediately?</p>
<p class="bas indent2"><span class="nm">6.</span><span class="cl">Question:</span> Why did Rav Hamnuna ask about fixing a Keli? He should have asked about making a Keli!</p>
<p class="bas indent2"><span class="nm">7.</span><span class="cl">Answer:</span> Rav Hamnuna asked about a Keli that becomes Tamei again when it is fixed.</p>
<p class="bas indent3"><span class="nm">i.</span><span class="cl">(Mishnah):</span> A metal Keli receives Tum'ah, whether or not it holds anything;</p>
<p class="bas indent3"><span class="nm">ii.</span>If it became Tamei, was broken (which is Metaher it) and was fixed, it returns to its original Tum'ah. (This is a Rabbinic enactment.)</p>
<p class="bas indent1"><span class="nm">(b)</span><span class="cl">Question (Rav Hamnuna):</span> Does it return to its original Tum'ah only regarding Tum'ah mid'Oraisa, but not regarding Tum'ah mid'Rabanan;</p>
<p class="bas indent2"><span class="nm">1.</span>Or, does this apply even to a Tum'ah mid'Rabanan (such as Meshamshim of idolatry)?</p>
<p class="bas indent2"><span class="nm">2.</span><span class="cl">Question:</span> Why did he ask about idolatry, and not a different Tum'ah mid'Rabanan?</p>
<p class="bas indent2"><span class="nm">3.</span><span class="cl">Answer:</span> Even if he would find that other Tum'os mid'Rabanan do not return, he still would not know about idolatry;</p>
<p class="bas indent3"><span class="nm">i.</span>Perhaps due to the stringency of idolatry, we treat its Tum'ah like mid'Oraisa, and it returns.</p>
<p class="bas indent1"><span class="nm">(c)</span>This question is not resolved.</p>
<p class="bas indent1"><span class="nm">(d)</span><span class="cl">Question (R. Yochanan):</span> If food was offered to idolatry, and the idolatry was Batel, does this Metaher the food?</p>
<p class="bas indent2"><span class="nm">1.</span><span class="cl">Question:</span> Why didn't he ask about Kelim (Rashi - Meshamshim; Tosfos - offered to idolatry)?</p>
<p class="bas indent2"><span class="nm">2.</span><span class="cl">Answer:</span> That was obvious. Since they can become Tahor through Tevilah (immersion), they become Tahor also through Bitul.</p>
<p class="bas indent3"><span class="nm">i.</span>The question is only about food, which cannot become Tahor through Tevilah.</p>
<p class="bas indent2"><span class="nm">3.</span><span class="cl">Question:</span> Why didn't he ask about idolatry itself?</p>
<p class="bas indent2"><span class="nm">4.</span><span class="cl">Answer:</span> That was obvious. Since the Isur (to benefit from it) goes away through Bitul, also the Tum'ah goes away;</p>
<p class="bas bbbline">52b----------------------------------------52b</p>
<p class="bas indent3"><span class="nm">i.</span>The question is only about Takroves. Its Isur never goes away, like Rav Gidal taught (50a).</p>
<p class="bas indent2"><span class="nm">5.</span><span class="cl">Essence of the question:</span> Do we say that since the Isur never goes away, also the Tum'ah never goes away?</p>
<p class="bas indent3"><span class="nm">i.</span>Or, the Isur never goes away because it is mid'Oraisa, but the Tum'ah is only mid'Rabanan, it goes away?</p>
<p class="bas indent1"><span class="nm">(e)</span>This question is not resolved.</p>
<p class="bas subject"><span class="nm">3)</span>MAY IDOLATRY THAT WAS 'MEVUTAL' BE USED IN THE 'MIKDASH'?</p>
<p class="bas indent1"><span class="nm">(a)</span><span class="cl">Question (R. Yosi ben Sha'ul):</span> Kelim that were used in Beis Chonyo (a place of worship in Miztrayim; Tana'im argue about whether it was idolatrous), may they be used in the Mikdash?</p>
<p class="bas indent2"><span class="nm">1.</span>He asks according to the opinion that Beis Chonyo was not l'Shem idolatry.</p>
<p class="bas indent2"><span class="nm">2.</span><span class="cl">(Mishnah):</span> Kohanim who served in Beis Chonyo may not serve in the Mikdash, and all the more so those who served idolatry.</p>
<p class="bas indent2"><span class="nm">3.</span><span class="cl">Essence of the question:</span> Perhaps we fine only the Kohanim, because they chose to transgress, but we do not forbid Kelim;</p>
<p class="bas indent3"><span class="nm">i.</span>Or, do we forbid even Kelim?</p>
<p class="bas indent1"><span class="nm">(b)</span><span class="cl">Answer (Rebbi):</span> They are forbidden, but I cannot remember the verse that teaches this!</p>
<p class="bas indent1"><span class="nm">(c)</span><span class="cl">Question:</span> "Ha'Kelim Asher Hizni'ach Melech Achaz... Hechanu (we immersed them) v'Hikdashnu" (we re-anointed them with oil, even though they had been used for idolatry)!</p>
<p class="bas indent1"><span class="nm">(d)</span><span class="cl">Answer (Rebbi):</span> You reminded me of the verse that teaches the law (but you misunderstood it)!</p>
<p class="bas indent2"><span class="nm">1.</span>"Hechanu" means that we put them in Genizah. "V'Hikdashnu" means that we were Makdish new Kelim in place of them.</p>
<p class="bas indent1"><span class="nm">(e)</span><span class="cl">Support (Mishnah):</span> The Chashmona'im hid the stones of the Mizbe'ach (that the Yevanim had desecrated) under the chamber in the northeast corner of the Mikdash.</p>
<p class="bas indent2"><span class="nm">1.</span><span class="cl">(Rav Sheshes):</span> They desecrated them by using them for idolatry.</p>
<p class="bas indent1"><span class="nm">(f)</span><span class="cl">Rejection (Rav Papa):</span> No, a verse teaches that those stones were forbidden even to people - "u'Va'u Vah Paritzim v'Chileluha" (once the Nochrim entered, the stones lost their Kedushah, so the Nochrim were able to acquire them and forbid them. This does not prove that Achaz could forbid Hekdesh.)</p>
<p class="bas indent1"><span class="nm">(g)</span><span class="cl">Question:</span> Why was Genizah required? They could have forced Nochrim to break (and be Mevatel) the rocks!</p>
<p class="bas indent1"><span class="nm">(h)</span><span class="cl">Answer:</span> We must build the Mizbe'ach with "Avanim Shelemos" (complete rocks).</p>
<p class="bas indent1"><span class="nm">(i)</span><span class="cl">Question:</span> They could smooth them out later (with a blade)!</p>
<p class="bas indent1"><span class="nm">(j)</span><span class="cl">Answer:</span> This disqualifies rocks for the Mizbe'ach - "Lo Sanif Aleihem Barzel."</p>
<p class="bas indent1"><span class="nm">(k)</span><span class="cl">Question:</span> Why didn't the Chashmona'im (force Nochrim to) break (and be Mevatel) the rocks, and benefit from them (for Chulin purposes)?</p>
<p class="bas indent2"><span class="nm">1.</span><span class="cl">(R. Oshaya):</span> Chachamim wanted to forbid all gold and silver in the world due to the gold and silver from Yerushalayim (most of which was Hekdesh).</p>
<p class="bas indent2"><span class="nm">2.</span><span class="cl">Objection:</span> Surely, the majority of gold and silver in the world is not from Yerushalayim!</p>
<p class="bas indent2"><span class="nm">3.</span><span class="cl">Correction (Abaye):</span> Rather, they wanted to forbid all coins of Hadri'anus and Torainus (Rashi - Roman emperors who ruled over Yerushalayim; Tosfos - large, round coins) whose forms were blunted (perhaps the coins were from Yerushalayim (Tosfos - from the days of David and Shlomo), most of which are Hekdesh);</p>
<p class="bas indent2"><span class="nm">4.</span>They expounded that they are permitted - "v'Chileluha" (they profaned it and made it Chulin).</p>
<p class="bas indent1"><span class="nm">(l)</span><span class="cl">Answer:</span> The coins had not been used to serve Hash-m. The Mizbe'ach was used to serve Hash-m, therefore it was improper for people to benefit from its rocks.</p>
<p class="bas subject"><span class="nm">4)</span>WHO CAN BE 'MEVATEL' IDOLATRY?</p>
<p class="bas indent1"><span class="nm">(a)</span><span class="cl">(Mishnah):</span> A Nochri can be Mevatel his idolatry or that of another Nochri. A Yisrael cannot be Mevatel a Nochri's idolatry.</p>
<p class="bas indent1"><span class="nm">(b)</span>If one is Mevatel a Nochri's idolatry, also the Meshamshim are Betelim. If one is Mevatel the Meshamshim, they are permitted, and the idolatry is forbidden.</p>
<p class="bas indent1"><span class="nm">(c)</span><span class="cl">Version #1 - (Gemara - Rebbi):</span> A Nochri can be Mevatel his idolatry or that of another Nochri.</p>
<p class="bas indent1"><span class="nm">(d)</span><span class="cl">R. Shimon (his son):</span> In your youth, you taught that a Nochri can be Mevatel his idolatry or that of a Yisrael!</p>
<p class="bas indent2"><span class="nm">1.</span><span class="cl">Question:</span> No one can be Mevatel idolatry of a Yisrael - "v'Sam ba'Saser"!</p>
<p class="bas indent2"><span class="nm">2.</span><span class="cl">Answer (R. Hilel brei d'R. Vilas):</span> The case is, the Nochri is a partner in the idolatry (he can be Mevatel the Yisrael's share also).</p>
<p class="bas indent1"><span class="nm">(e)</span><span class="cl">Question:</span> What was Rebbi's reasoning in his youth, and what was his reasoning in his old age?</p>
<p class="bas indent1"><span class="nm">(f)</span>In his youth, he held that a Yisrael serves the joint idolatry according to the Nochri's will. When the Nochri is Mevatel it, also the Yisrael is Mevatel;</p>
<p class="bas indent2"><span class="nm">1.</span>In his old age, he held that a Yisrael serves according to his own will. He is not Mevatel when the Nochri is Mevatel.</p>
<p class="bas indent1"><span class="nm">(g)</span><span class="cl">Version #2 (Mishnah):</span> A Yisrael cannot be Mevatel a Nochri's idolatry.</p>
<p class="bas indent1"><span class="nm">(h)</span><span class="cl">Objection:</span> This is obvious!</p>
<p class="bas indent1"><span class="nm">(i)</span><span class="cl">Answer (R. Hilel brei d'R. Vilas):</span> The case is, the Yisrael is a partner in the idolatry;</p>
<p class="bas indent2"><span class="nm">1.</span>(Indeed, it is obvious that the Yisrael cannot be Mevatel at all.) The Chidush is the inference. Even though the Nochri cannot be Mevatel the Yisrael's share, he can be Mevatel his own share.</p>
