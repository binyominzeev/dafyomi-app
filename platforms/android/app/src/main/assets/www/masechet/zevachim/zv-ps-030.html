<div class="subject"><span class="nm">1)</span><p>DIFFERENT INTENTS (cont.)</p></div>
<div class="indent1"><span class="nm">(a)</span><p><span class="cl">(Mishnah - R. Yehudah):</span> The general rule is, if intent Chutz li'Zmano came first, it is Pigul, and there is Kares.</p></div>
<div class="indent1"><span class="nm">(b)</span><p><span class="cl">Question:</span> According to R. Yochanan, 'the general rule' comes to include intents in one Avodah. According to Ilfa, what does this come to include?</p></div>
<div class="indent1"><span class="nm">(c)</span><p>This is left difficult.</p></div>
<div class="indent1"><span class="nm">(d)</span><p><span class="cl">(Mishnah - R. Meir):</span> If Reuven said 'this (Chulin) animal is Temuras (in place of an) Olah, Temuras Shelamim', it is Temuras Olah (i.e. it is an Olah);</p></div>
<div class="indent1"><span class="nm">(e)</span><p>R. Yosi says, if he meant to say both from the beginning, they both take effect (the animal will be sold, and half the money is used to buy an Olah, and half to buy a Shelamim). Since he cannot say them simultaneously, there is no reason to favor his first words;</p></div>
<div class="indent2"><span class="nm">1.</span><p>If after saying 'Temuras Olah' he reconsidered and said 'Temuras Shelamim', it is an Olah.</p></div>
<div class="indent1"><span class="nm">(f)</span><p><span class="cl">Question:</span> If he said 'Temuras Olah <i>v</i>'Shelamim', what is the law?</p></div>
<div class="indent1"><span class="nm">(g)</span><p><span class="cl">Version #1 (Rashi) Question:</span> If he said 'l'Chatzos' (half should be Temuras Olah, half should be Temuras Shelamim), what is the law?</p></div>
<div class="indent1"><span class="nm">(h)</span><p><span class="cl">Version #2 (R. Chananel):</span> If he said 'l'Chatzos' (at midday it should become Temuras Olah v'Shelamim, so they take effect simultaneously), what is the law? (end of Version #2)</p></div>
<div class="indent1"><span class="nm">(i)</span><p><span class="cl">Answer #1 (Abaye):</span> Surely, even R. Meir agrees that both take effect.</p></div>
<div class="indent1"><span class="nm">(j)</span><p><span class="cl">Question (Rava):</span> This is like different intents in Shechitah, and R. Yehudah (argues with Chachamim and) says that we follow the first intent (and R. Meir holds like him)!</p></div>
<div class="indent1"><span class="nm">(k)</span><p><span class="cl">Answer (Abaye):</span> You assume that Shechitah is instantaneous (i.e. cutting up to half the Simanim is only <i>preparation</i>. Cutting Mashehu (an arbitrarily small amount) past half is the actual Shechitah. Therefore, both intents take effect simultaneously at the moment Shechitah is finished);</p></div>
<div class="indent2"><span class="nm">1.</span><p>You are wrong. The entire cutting (of the Simanim, until the majority is cut) is considered Shechitah. (Therefore, the intents take effect one after the other.)</p></div>
<div class="indent1"><span class="nm">(l)</span><p><span class="cl">Question (Rava):</span> 'L'Chatzos' is like different intents in Kemitzah (which is instantaneous), and R. Yehudah says that we follow the first intent!</p></div>
<div class="indent1"><span class="nm">(m)</span><p><span class="cl">Answer (Abaye):</span> The case is, he had one intent when burning the Kometz, and the other intent later, when burning the frankincense.</p></div>
<div class="indent1"><span class="nm">(n)</span><p><span class="cl">Question (Rava):</span> R. Yehudah argues even about Kemitzah of a Minchas Chotei (which has no frankincense)!</p></div>
<div class="indent1"><span class="nm">(o)</span><p><span class="cl">Answer #1 (Abaye):</span> No, he agrees in that case.</p></div>
<div class="indent1"><span class="nm">(p)</span><p><span class="cl">Answer #2 (Rav Ashi):</span> We could say that he argues when the intents came during different steps (while bringing the Kometz to the Mizbe'ach).</p></div>
<div class="indent2"><span class="nm">1.</span><p>Rav Simi Bar Ashi taught a Beraisa like Abaye (if he said 'l'Chatzos', even R. Meir agrees that both take effect). Rav Huna bar Noson taught a Beraisa like Rava (even if he said 'l'Chatzos', R. Meir holds that the first takes effect).</p></div>
<div class="subject"><span class="nm">2)</span><p>DO WE FOLLOW THE FIRST THING SAID?</p></div>
<div class="indent1"><span class="nm">(a)</span><p><span class="cl">(Rav Dimi):</span> R. Meir holds like R. Yehudah. We follow the first thing said.</p></div>
<div class="indent2"><span class="nm">1.</span><p><span class="cl">(Mishnah - R. Yehudah):</span> The general rule is, if intent Chutz li'Zmano came first, it is Pigul, and there is Kares.</p></div>
<div class="bbbline">30b----------------------------------------30b</p></div>
<div class="indent1"><span class="nm">(b)</span><p><span class="cl">Question (Abaye):</span> Rabah bar bar Chanah cited R. Yochanan to say that R. Meir and R. Yosi do not argue.</p></div>
<div class="indent2"><span class="nm">1.</span><p><span class="cl">Objection:</span> They do argue!</p></div>
<div class="indent2"><span class="nm">2.</span><p><span class="cl">Answer:</span> He means, they argue only about what they explicitly argue about, but not whether we follow the first thing said.</p></div>
<div class="indent2"><span class="nm">3.</span><p><span class="cl">(R. Yitzchak bar Yosef):</span> All agree that if he said 'this should take effect (Temuras Olah), and then this (Temuras Shelamim)', the latter does not take effect;</p></div>
<div class="indent2"><span class="nm">4.</span><p>All agree that if he said 'this should not take effect unless this also takes effect', both take effect;</p></div>
<div class="indent2"><span class="nm">5.</span><p>They argue when he said 'Temuras Olah Temuras Shelamim':</p></div>
<div class="indent3"><span class="nm">i.</span><p>R. Meir says, (if he wanted both to take effect) he should have said 'Temuras Olah v'Shelamim.' Since he did not say this, this shows that he tried to retract (but he cannot);</p></div>
<div class="indent3"><span class="nm">ii.</span><p>R. Yosi says, he did not say 'Temuras Olah v'Shelamim', for this would imply that half is Temuras Olah, and half is Temuras Shelamim (he knows that this cannot be offered);</p></div>
<div class="indent3"><span class="nm">iii.</span><p>He intended that the entire animal be Temurah of an Olah and also of a Shelamim. (He thought that this can be offered.)</p></div>
<div class="indent1"><span class="nm">(c)</span><p><span class="cl">Answer (Rav Dimi):</span> I argue with Rabah bar bar Chanah. I say that R. Meir argues with R. Yosi (about whether we follow the first thing said).</p></div>
<div class="subject"><span class="nm">3)</span><p>WHEN ARE INTENTS MIXED?</p></div>
<div class="indent1"><span class="nm">(a)</span><p><span class="cl">Question (Ula):</span> Is the text of our Mishnah 'k'Zayis (tomorrow) k'Zayis (Chutz li'Mkomo)', or 'k'Zayis <i>ve</i>k'Zayis?</p></div>
<div class="indent2"><span class="nm">1.</span><p>If it is the former, only in this case R. Yehudah follows the first intent, but if he said k'Zayis vek'Zayis, the intents are mixed, so R. Yehudah admits that there is no Kares.</p></div>
<div class="indent2"><span class="nm">2.</span><p>If it is the latter, R. Yehudah considers even this to be Prata (separate intents), and all the more so he says so about k'Zayis k'Zayis.</p></div>
<div class="indent1"><span class="nm">(b)</span><p><span class="cl">Answer:</span> We learn from the following.</p></div>
<div class="indent1"><span class="nm">(c)</span><p><span class="cl">Levi:</span> If one intended (to eat the same) k'Zayis tomorrow b'Chutz (li'Mkomo), what is the law?</p></div>
<div class="indent1"><span class="nm">(d)</span><p><span class="cl">Rebbi:</span> That is a fine question! It is Pasul, and there is no Kares.</p></div>
<div class="indent1"><span class="nm">(e)</span><p><span class="cl">R. Shimon b'Rebbi:</span> Why was it a good question? We already learn this from our Mishnah!</p></div>
<div class="indent2"><span class="nm">1.</span><p><span class="cl">(Mishnah):</span> If he said 'k'Zayis b'Chutz, k'Zayis tomorrow', or vice-versa, or 'half a k'Zayis b'Chutz, and half a k'Zayis tomorrow', or vice-versa, it is Pasul, and there is no Kares; (R. Yehudah says, if intent Chutz li'Zmano came first, it is Pigul, and there is Kares).</p></div>
<div class="indent2"><span class="nm">2.</span><p>They argue about intents for different k'Zeisim, but all agree that intents about the same k'Zayis are Klala (mixed), there is no Kares!</p></div>
<div class="indent1"><span class="nm">(f)</span><p><span class="cl">Rebbi:</span> Based on what I taught him, he asked properly.</p></div>
<div class="indent2"><span class="nm">1.</span><p>I taught you (R. Shimon) two cases (of Prata, k'Zayis k'Zayis and k'Zayis vek'Zayis). You properly inferred that the third case (intents about the same k'Zayis) is Klala;</p></div>
<div class="indent2"><span class="nm">2.</span><p>I taught Levi one case (of Prata). He heard Rabanan saying two cases. He was unsure whether I was precise with him (the second case is Klala), and Rabanan (mistakenly) extrapolated to the second case, or if I taught both to them, and I omitted teaching to him one of them.</p></div>
<div class="indent1"><span class="nm">(g)</span><p><span class="cl">Question:</span> Which case did Rebbi teach to Levi?</p></div>
<div class="indent2"><span class="nm">1.</span><p><span class="cl">Suggestion:</span> He taught to him k'Zayis vek'Zayis.</p></div>
<div class="indent2"><span class="nm">2.</span><p><span class="cl">Rejection:</span> If so, Levi would have known that all the more so, k'Zayis k'Zayis (is Prata)!</p></div>
<div class="indent1"><span class="nm">(h)</span><p><span class="cl">Answer:</span> He taught him to k'Zayis k'Zayis.</p></div>
<div class="indent1"><span class="nm">(i)</span><p><span class="cl">Question:</span> If Levi was unsure about k'Zayis vek'Zayis, why didn't he ask about it?</p></div>
<div class="indent1"><span class="nm">(j)</span><p><span class="cl">Answer:</span> It was better to ask 'k'Zayis tomorrow b'Chutz', for he will learn two things from the answer;</p></div>
<div class="indent2"><span class="nm">1.</span><p>Had he asked k'Zayis vek'Zayis, and Rebbi would answer that it is Klala, Levi would indeed know that all the more so, k'Zayis tomorrow b'Chutz is Klala;</p></div>
<div class="indent2"><span class="nm">2.</span><p>However, if Rebbi would answer that it is Prata, he would not know k'Zayis tomorrow b'Chutz.</p></div>
<div class="indent1"><span class="nm">(k)</span><p><span class="cl">Question:</span> The same applies to asking k'Zayis tomorrow b'Chutz!</p></div>
<div class="indent2"><span class="nm">1.</span><p>If Rebbi would answer that it is Prata, Levi would indeed know that all the more so, k'Zayis ve'k'Zayis tomorrow b'Chutz is Prata;</p></div>
<div class="indent2"><span class="nm">2.</span><p>However, if Rebbi would answer that it is Klala, Levi would not know k'Zayis ve'k'Zayis!</p></div>
<div class="indent1"><span class="nm">(l)</span><p><span class="cl">Answer:</span> Levi could derive this from Rebbi's response. (Levi's question implies that Levi is sure that k'Zayis vek'Zayis is Prata).</p></div>
<div class="indent2"><span class="nm">1.</span><p>If k'Zayis vek'Zayis is indeed Prata, Rebbi would not be angry.</p></div>
<div class="indent2"><span class="nm">2.</span><p>However, if k'Zayis vek'Zayis is Klala, Rebbi would be angry that Levi did not infer this (from the fact that Rebbi taught to him only k'Zayis k'Zayis), and rather assumed the opposite!</p></div>
