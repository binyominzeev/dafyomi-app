<p class="bas subject"><span class="nm">1)</span>TEACHING TORAH TO CHILDREN</p>
<p class="bas indent1"><span class="nm">(a)</span><span class="cl">(Rav Yehudah):</span> Yehoshua ben Gamla prevented Torah from being forgotten from Yisrael!</p>
<p class="bas indent1"><span class="nm">(b)</span>At first, a father taught Torah to his child Torah. An orphan did not learn;</p>
<p class="bas indent2"><span class="nm">1.</span><span class="cl">Question:</span> What was the reason?</p>
<p class="bas indent2"><span class="nm">2.</span><span class="cl">Answer:</span> They read "v'Limadtem <i>Osam</i>" like 'Atem' (you yourselves, i.e. the fathers, are commanded to teach your children);</p>
<p class="bas indent1"><span class="nm">(c)</span>They enacted to establish teachers in Yerushalayim.</p>
<p class="bas indent2"><span class="nm">1.</span>They learned from "u'Devar Hash-m mi'Yerushalayim."</p>
<p class="bas indent1"><span class="nm">(d)</span>Still, fathers took their children to Yerushalayim, but orphans did not go;</p>
<p class="bas indent1"><span class="nm">(e)</span>They enacted to establish teachers in every province. Children would start learning at the age of 16 or 17.</p>
<p class="bas indent1"><span class="nm">(f)</span>If the Rebbi got angry at the child, the child would leave;</p>
<p class="bas indent2"><span class="nm">1.</span>Yehoshua ben Gamla enacted to establish teachers in every region and city, and that children would begin learning at the age of six or seven.</p>
<p class="bas indent1"><span class="nm">(g)</span><span class="cl">Rav (to Rav Shmuel bar Shilas):</span> Do not accept to teach children less than six;</p>
<p class="bas indent2"><span class="nm">1.</span>After six, take them and stuff them with Torah.</p>
<p class="bas indent2"><span class="nm">2.</span>Hit children only with a shoe strap (it does not hurt much or cause damage).</p>
<p class="bas indent2"><span class="nm">3.</span>If a child is learning, this is fine;</p>
<p class="bas indent3"><span class="nm">i.</span>If he is not, just put him with others who are learning, and also he will learn.</p>
<p class="bas indent1"><span class="nm">(h)</span><span class="cl">Question (Beraisa):</span> People of a Chatzer can prevent a member from setting up practice as a doctor, bloodletter, weaver, or a teacher of children.</p>
<p class="bas indent1"><span class="nm">(i)</span><span class="cl">Answer:</span> That refers to teaching Nochri children.</p>
<p class="bas indent1"><span class="nm">(j)</span><span class="cl">Question (Beraisa):</span> Two people in a Chatzer, one can prevent the other from setting up practice as a doctor, bloodletter, weaver, or a teacher of children.</p>
<p class="bas indent1"><span class="nm">(k)</span><span class="cl">Answer:</span> That refers to teaching Nochri children.</p>
<p class="bas indent1"><span class="nm">(l)</span><span class="cl">Question (Beraisa):</span> One who owns a house in a joint Chatzer, he may not rent it to a doctor, bloodletter, weaver, or a Yisrael or Nochri teacher of children.</p>
<p class="bas indent1"><span class="nm">(m)</span><span class="cl">Answer:</span> That refers to the principal teacher of the city. (Other teachers assist him, and there is a great noise.)</p>
<p class="bas indent1"><span class="nm">(n)</span><span class="cl">(Rava):</span> After Yehoshua ben Gamla's enactment, we do not transport children from city to city (each city must get its own teacher).</p>
<p class="bas indent2"><span class="nm">1.</span>We do transport children from one synagogue to another.</p>
<p class="bas indent2"><span class="nm">2.</span>We do not transport children across a river, unless there is a wide bridge across it.</p>
<p class="bas indent1"><span class="nm">(o)</span><span class="cl">(Rava):</span> A teacher should have 25 children. If there are 50 children, we get two teachers.</p>
<p class="bas indent2"><span class="nm">1.</span>If there are 40, the city hires an assistant to help.</p>
<p class="bas subject"><span class="nm">2)</span>WHICH TEACHER TO TAKE</p>
<p class="bas indent1"><span class="nm">(a)</span><span class="cl">(Rava):</span> If a teacher learns, and there is another teacher available who learns more, we do not switch, lest the new teacher will (be haughty and) slacken from his obligation to teach.</p>
<p class="bas indent1"><span class="nm">(b)</span><span class="cl">Objection (Rav Dimi of Neharde'a):</span> Just the contrary, he will learn more. Jealousy among Chachamim makes them learn better.</p>
<p class="bas indent1"><span class="nm">(c)</span><span class="cl">(Rava):</span> If there are two teachers, and one learns more but the other teaches more precisely, we prefer the former. If he makes any mistakes, the children will later learn the correct version;</p>
<p class="bas indent1"><span class="nm">(d)</span><span class="cl">(Rav Dimi of Neharde'a):</span> No, we take the latter. Once a child learned incorrectly, the mistake will stick with him.</p>
<p class="bas indent2"><span class="nm">1.</span>"Yo'av... Hichris Kol Zachar b'Edom."</p>
<p class="bas indent2"><span class="nm">2.</span><span class="cl">David:</span> Why did you kill only the men?</p>
<p class="bas bbbline">21b----------------------------------------21b</p>
<p class="bas indent2"><span class="nm">3.</span><span class="cl">Yo'av:</span> It says "Timcheh Es Zachar (the males of) Amalek".</p>
<p class="bas indent2"><span class="nm">4.</span><span class="cl">David:</span> The word is "Zecher (the remembrance of)"!</p>
<p class="bas indent2"><span class="nm">5.</span><span class="cl">Yo'av:</span> I was taught 'Zachar'!</p>
<p class="bas indent2"><span class="nm">6.</span>They called Yo'av's Rebbi (from when he was a child), who said that he taught 'Zecher'. Yo'av drew his sword to kill him (for not having listened to how Yo'av learned the verse).</p>
<p class="bas indent2"><span class="nm">7.</span><span class="cl">His Rebbi:</span> Why do you want to kill me?</p>
<p class="bas indent2"><span class="nm">8.</span><span class="cl">Yo'av:</span> "Arur Oseh Meleches Hash-m Remiyah".</p>
<p class="bas indent2"><span class="nm">9.</span><span class="cl">His Rebbi:</span> Let it suffice that I am cursed!</p>
<p class="bas indent2"><span class="nm">10.</span><span class="cl">Yo'av:</span> "V'Arur Mone'a Charbo mi'Dam".</p>
<p class="bas indent3"><span class="nm">i.</span>Some say that he killed him. Others say that he did not.</p>
<p class="bas indent1"><span class="nm">(e)</span><span class="cl">(Rava):</span> The following may be fired (for negligence) without warning: one who teaches children, a planter, a slaughterer, a bloodletter, and the town scribe (Rashi - to write Sifrei Torah; Tosfos - to write documents);</p>
<p class="bas indent2"><span class="nm">1.</span>The general rule is, if a worker's mistakes cannot be corrected, we consider him to be warned.</p>
<p class="bas subject"><span class="nm">3)</span>INFRINGING ON ANOTHER'S LIVELIHOOD</p>
<p class="bas indent1"><span class="nm">(a)</span><span class="cl">(Rav Huna):</span> If a member of a Mavoy set up a mill (to grind for wages, or to rent it out), he can stop someone else in the Mavoy from setting one up, for this infringes on his livelihood.</p>
<p class="bas indent1"><span class="nm">(b)</span><span class="cl">Support (Beraisa):</span> One who wants to spread a fish net must distance himself from a fish (that another fisherman has been following - Rashi; R. Gershom - from the net of another fisherman) as far as a fish goes (from its place).</p>
<p class="bas indent2"><span class="nm">1.</span><span class="cl">Question:</span> How much is this?</p>
<p class="bas indent2"><span class="nm">2.</span><span class="cl">Answer (Rabah bar Rav Huna):</span> It is a Parsah (about four kilometers).</p>
<p class="bas indent1"><span class="nm">(c)</span><span class="cl">Rejection:</span> That is different, for the first fisherman invested food and is confident of getting the fish (Rashi; Rabeinu Gershom - the second fisherman drops food, which causes fish in the first one's trap to leave, this is theft).</p>
<p class="bas indent1"><span class="nm">(d)</span><span class="cl">Suggestion (Ravina):</span> Rav Huna holds like R. Yehudah.</p>
<p class="bas indent1"><span class="nm">(e)</span><span class="cl">(Mishnah - R. Yehudah):</span> A grocer may not give treats to children, for this accustoms them to patronize him;</p>
<p class="bas indent2"><span class="nm">1.</span>Chachamim permit this.</p>
<p class="bas indent1"><span class="nm">(f)</span><span class="cl">Rejection (Rava):</span> He can even hold like Chachamim.</p>
<p class="bas indent2"><span class="nm">1.</span>Chachamim argue with R. Yehudah only because the grocer can say 'just like I give nuts, you can give almonds.</p>
<p class="bas indent2"><span class="nm">2.</span>Chachamim agree that another person may not set up a store in the Mavoy, for this infringes on the livelihood of the first.</p>
<p class="bas indent1"><span class="nm">(g)</span><span class="cl">Question (Beraisa):</span> One may set up a store next to another's store, or a bathhouse next to another's bathhouse;</p>
<p class="bas indent2"><span class="nm">1.</span>The first cannot protest, for each is on his own property.</p>
<p class="bas indent1"><span class="nm">(h)</span><span class="cl">Answer:</span> Tana'im argue about this.</p>
<p class="bas indent2"><span class="nm">1.</span><span class="cl">(Beraisa):</span> People of a Mavoy may force one another not to rent a house to a tailor, tanner, teacher of children or a craftsman from outside the Mavoy (if someone in the Mavoy does this);</p>
<p class="bas indent2"><span class="nm">2.</span>One cannot prevent someone in the Mavoy from offering the same service as he does.</p>
<p class="bas indent2"><span class="nm">3.</span>R. Shimon ben Gamliel says, he can prevent him.</p>
<p class="bas indent1"><span class="nm">(i)</span><span class="cl">(Rav Huna brei d'Rav Yehoshua):</span> Surely, one can prevent someone from another city from offering the same service as he does;</p>
<p class="bas indent2"><span class="nm">1.</span>If they both pay head-tax in the same city, he cannot prevent him.</p>
<p class="bas indent2"><span class="nm">2.</span>One cannot prevent someone from the same Mavoy.</p>
<p class="bas indent1"><span class="nm">(j)</span><span class="cl">Question (Rav Huna brei d'Rav Yehoshua):</span> Can one prevent someone from a different Mavoy?</p>
<p class="bas indent1"><span class="nm">(k)</span>This question is not resolved.</p>
<p class="bas indent1"><span class="nm">(l)</span><span class="cl">(Rav Yosef):</span> Rav Huna admits that one cannot prevent a teacher of children from entering the same Mavoy;</p>
<p class="bas indent2"><span class="nm">1.</span>Jealousy among Chachamim makes them learn better.</p>
