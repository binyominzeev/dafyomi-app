<div class="subject"><span class="nm">1)</span><p>THE DAY REBBI EXPIRED</p></div>
<div class="indent1"><span class="nm">(a)</span><p>The day that Rebbi expired, Chachamim had decreed a fast and were praying for him;</p></div>
<div class="indent2"><span class="nm">1.</span><p>They said that anyone who will say that Rebbi died will be put to death.</p></div>
<div class="indent1"><span class="nm">(b)</span><p>Rebbi's maid shouted from the roof, "The higher beings and the lower beings both want Rebbi. May it be Hash-m's will that the lower beings' request is done!"</p></div>
<div class="indent1"><span class="nm">(c)</span><p>After she saw how often Rebbi had to relieve himself, and how painful it was for him to remove his Tefilin and put them on again, she said, "It should be His will that the higher beings' request is done."</p></div>
<div class="indent1"><span class="nm">(d)</span><p>Chachamim continued to pray that Rebbi live. The maid took pottery and threw it to the ground. Chachamim stopped praying, and Rebbi died.</p></div>
<div class="indent1"><span class="nm">(e)</span><p>Chachamim told Bar Kapara to check how Rebbi was. He found that he had died. He tore his clothes and folded them back so they would not appear torn.</p></div>
<div class="indent2"><span class="nm">1.</span><p><span class="cl">Bar Kapara:</span> Angels and Tzadikim grabbed the Holy Ark. The angels overpowered, and took the Ark.</p></div>
<div class="indent2"><span class="nm">2.</span><p><span class="cl">Chachamim:</span> Did Rebbi die?!</p></div>
<div class="indent2"><span class="nm">3.</span><p><span class="cl">Bar Kapara:</span> You said it. I did not.</p></div>
<div class="indent1"><span class="nm">(f)</span><p>When Rebbi died, he stuck his 10 fingers towards Heaven. 'Hashem, you know that I toiled with all 10 fingers in Torah, and did not enjoy even as much as I toiled with my pinkie. May it be Your will that I will have Shalom in my eternal rest!'</p></div>
<div class="indent2"><span class="nm">1.</span><p><span class="cl">A voice from Shamayim:</span> "He will come to Shalom, they will rest on their beds."</p></div>
<div class="indent2"><span class="nm">2.</span><p><span class="cl">Question:</span> It should say that 'On your bed'!</p></div>
<div class="indent2"><span class="nm">3.</span><p><span class="cl">Answer:</span> This supports R. Chiya bar Gamda.</p></div>
<div class="indent3"><span class="nm">i.</span><p><span class="cl">(R. Chiya bar Gamda):</span> When a Tzadik leaves this world, angels tell Hash-m that he is coming. Hash-m commands the Tzadikim to greet him. Afterwards, they return to their beds.</p></div>
<div class="indent1"><span class="nm">(g)</span><p><span class="cl">(R. Elazar):</span> When a Tzadik leaves this world, three groups of angels greet him. One group says 'Come in Shalom'; one group says 'He goes straightly', and the third says "He will come to Shalom, they will rest on their beds";</p></div>
<div class="indent1"><span class="nm">(h)</span><p>When a Rasha leaves this world, three groups of damaging angels greet him. One group says "Hash-m said to the wicked 'there is no Shalom'"; one says "In sadness you will lie down"; the third says, "Descend and lie with the uncircumcised."</p></div>
<div class="subject"><span class="nm">2)</span><p>HOW LONG MAY A WIDOW COLLECT HER KESUVAH?</p></div>
<div class="indent1"><span class="nm">(a)</span><p><span class="cl">(Mishnah - R. Meir):</span> As long as a widow is in her father's house, she may always collect her Kesuvah. If she is in her (late) husband's house, she can collect until 25 years, for in 25 years, she does favors (for neighbors with the orphans' money) equivalent to her Kesuvah;</p></div>
<div class="indent1"><span class="nm">(b)</span><p>Chachamim say that as long as she is in her husband's house, she may always collect her Kesuvah. If she is in her father's house, she can collect until 25 years;</p></div>
<div class="indent2"><span class="nm">1.</span><p>If she died, her heirs mention her Kesuvah within 25 years.</p></div>
<div class="indent1"><span class="nm">(c)</span><p>(Gemara - Abaye) Question Does the poorest Yisrael do favors equal to her Kesuvah in 25 years, and also the richest?!</p></div>
<div class="indent1"><span class="nm">(d)</span><p><span class="cl">Answer (Rav Yosef):</span> Yes! People give proportional to their wealth.</p></div>
<div class="indent1"><span class="nm">(e)</span><p><span class="cl">Question:</span> According to R. Meir, if she requests her Kesuvah within 25 years, do we deduct proportionally for the favors she has done?</p></div>
<div class="indent2"><span class="nm">1.</span><p>This question is unresolved.</p></div>
<div class="indent1"><span class="nm">(f)</span><p><span class="cl">(Mishnah - Chachamim):</span> As long as...</p></div>
<div class="indent1"><span class="nm">(g)</span><p><span class="cl">Question (Abaye):</span> Do we say that if she requests her Kesuvah before dark (on the last day of the 25 years), she collects, and if she comes after dark she does not collect?!</p></div>
<div class="indent1"><span class="nm">(h)</span><p><span class="cl">Answer (Rav Yosef):</span> All measures of Chachamim are that way!</p></div>
<div class="indent2"><span class="nm">1.</span><p>(We expound that a Mikvah must be big enough for a person to immerse his entire body.) It is true that a person can immerse in 40 Sa'im of water, but if a tiny amount is lacking from this, his body will not fit?!</p></div>
<div class="indent1"><span class="nm">(i)</span><p><span class="cl">(Rav Yehudah):</span> R. Yishmael b'Rebbi Yosi testified that the 25 year limit is only if she does not have her Kesuvah (the document). If she has her Kesuvah, she can always collect;</p></div>
<div class="indent1"><span class="nm">(j)</span><p><span class="cl">(R. Elazar):</span> Even if she has her Kesuvah, she can collect only until 25 years.</p></div>
<div class="indent1"><span class="nm">(k)</span><p><span class="cl">Question (Rav Sheshes - Beraisa):</span> A creditor collects even if he never mentioned the debt.</p></div>
<div class="indent2"><span class="nm">1.</span><p><span class="cl">Question:</span> What is the case?</p></div>
<div class="indent3"><span class="nm">i.</span><p>If he has no document, with what does he collect?</p></div>
<div class="indent2"><span class="nm">2.</span><p><span class="cl">Answer:</span> Rather, he has a document. Only a creditor collects without having mentioned the debt, since he would not pardon the debt, but we assume that a widow pardoned the Kesuvah!</p></div>
<div class="indent1"><span class="nm">(l)</span><p><span class="cl">Answer (Rav Sheshes):</span> Really, the creditor has no document. The case is, the borrower agrees that he never paid.</p></div>
<div class="indent1"><span class="nm">(m)</span><p><span class="cl">Question:</span> R. Ilai said that a Beraisa says that a divorcee is like a creditor!</p></div>
<div class="indent2"><span class="nm">1.</span><p><span class="cl">Question:</span> What is the case?</p></div>
<div class="indent3"><span class="nm">i.</span><p>If she does not have her Kesuvah, with what does she collect?</p></div>
<div class="indent2"><span class="nm">2.</span><p><span class="cl">Answer:</span> Rather, she has her Kesuvah. Only a divorcee collects, since she would not pardon the Kesuvah, but we assume that a widow pardoned the Kesuvah!</p></div>
<div class="indent1"><span class="nm">(n)</span><p><span class="cl">Answer:</span> Here also, she does not have the Kesuvah. The case is, her husband agrees that he never paid.</p></div>
<div class="indent1"><span class="nm">(o)</span><p><span class="cl">(Rav Nachman - Beraisa):</span> If she demanded payment of the Kesuvah, she gets another 25 years. If she has her Kesuvah, she can always collect.</p></div>
<div class="bbbline">104b----------------------------------------104b</p></div>
<div class="indent1"><span class="nm">(p)</span><p><span class="cl">Questions (Rav Nachman bar Rav Chisda):</span> Do the Tana'im argue when she has the Kesuvah, or when she doesn't? Like whom is the Halachah?</p></div>
<div class="indent1"><span class="nm">(q)</span><p><span class="cl">Answer (Rav Nachman):</span> They argue when she does not have the Kesuvah. The Halachah follows Chachamim.</p></div>
<div class="indent1"><span class="nm">(r)</span><p><span class="cl">(Rav Dimi):</span> The 25 year limit applies only to the basic Kesuvah (100 or 200). She may always collect any Tosefes (addition) to the Kesuvah.</p></div>
<div class="indent1"><span class="nm">(s)</span><p><span class="cl">(R. Avahu):</span> Even the Tosefes may be collected only until 25 years;</p></div>
<div class="indent2"><span class="nm">1.</span><p><span class="cl">(R. Aibo):</span> Stipulations of the Kesuvah are like the Kesuvah.</p></div>
<div class="indent1"><span class="nm">(t)</span><p><span class="cl">(R. Aba citing Rav Huna citing Rav):</span> The 25 year limit is only for the basic Kesuvah. She may always collect Tosefes.</p></div>
<div class="indent2"><span class="nm">1.</span><p><span class="cl">R. Aba:</span> Did Rav really say that?</p></div>
<div class="indent2"><span class="nm">2.</span><p><span class="cl">Rav Huna:</span> Do you argue with me or commend me?</p></div>
<div class="indent2"><span class="nm">3.</span><p><span class="cl">R. Aba:</span> I argue with you.</p></div>
<div class="subject"><span class="nm">3)</span><p>OTHER CASES WHEN THE KESUVAH IS PARDONED</p></div>
<div class="indent1"><span class="nm">(a)</span><p>The mother-in-law of R. Chiya Arichta married his brother. The brother died, and she lived by her father. He fed her there for 25 years; she demanded that he still feed her.</p></div>
<div class="indent2"><span class="nm">1.</span><p><span class="cl">Rav Chiya Arichta:</span> You are no longer entitled to food.</p></div>
<div class="indent2"><span class="nm">2.</span><p><span class="cl">The widow:</span> Give me my Kesuvah.</p></div>
<div class="indent2"><span class="nm">3.</span><p><span class="cl">Rav Chiya:</span> You are not entitled to food, nor the Kesuvah.</p></div>
<div class="indent1"><span class="nm">(b)</span><p>They came in front of Rabah bar Shila.</p></div>
<div class="indent2"><span class="nm">1.</span><p><span class="cl">Rav Chiya:</span> I fed her for 25 years. I swear that I personally carried the food on my shoulder!</p></div>
<div class="indent2"><span class="nm">2.</span><p><span class="cl">Rabah bar Shila:</span> Chachamim say that she may always collect in her husband's house because she is too embarrassed to demand the Kesuvah. The same applies here (because you showed such honor to her). Go pay her!</p></div>
<div class="indent1"><span class="nm">(c)</span><p>Rav Chiya Arichta did not comply. Rabah bar Shila wrote an Adrachta (a document authorizing her to collect from his property). They came in front of Rava.</p></div>
<div class="indent2"><span class="nm">1.</span><p><span class="cl">Rav Chiya Arichta:</span> Do you see how he judged me!</p></div>
<div class="indent2"><span class="nm">2.</span><p><span class="cl">Rava:</span> He judged you properly.</p></div>
<div class="indent2"><span class="nm">3.</span><p><span class="cl">The widow:</span> If so, he should return the Peiros of the property from the time the Adrachta was written.</p></div>
<div class="indent2"><span class="nm">4.</span><p>Rava noticed that the Adrachta did not say 'It became known to us that this property belonged to the deceased.' He ruled that it was invalid.</p></div>
<div class="indent2"><span class="nm">5.</span><p><span class="cl">The widow:</span> At least give me Peiros from the end of the auction of the property until now.</p></div>
<div class="indent2"><span class="nm">6.</span><p><span class="cl">Rava:</span> You would be entitled to them if the Adrachta was valid. Here it was mistaken, so you do not receive the Peiros!</p></div>
<div class="indent2"><span class="nm">7.</span><p><span class="cl">The widow:</span> You yourself hold that if a sale document does not mention Acharayos (a commitment to compensate the buyer if a creditor will take the land), we say that this was a mistake of the scribe, and it is as if Acharayos is written in it! (Here also, the scribe should have written a proper Adrachta!)</p></div>
<div class="indent2"><span class="nm">8.</span><p><span class="cl">Rava:</span> Here, it was not the scribe's oversight. Rabah bar Shila himself thought that it makes no difference which property of Rav Chiya is used to pay the Kesuvah (even though there was a lien only on what he inherited from his brother).</p></div>
<div class="indent3"><span class="nm">i.</span><p>This is a mistake. If she collects from his own property, she may improve the property, and he will let his brother's property depreciate, and later he will take back his improved property, and give to her the depreciated property on which her lien was!</p></div>
<div class="indent3"><span class="nm">ii.</span><p>This will cause people to scorn Beis Din (for not protecting the widow).</p></div>
