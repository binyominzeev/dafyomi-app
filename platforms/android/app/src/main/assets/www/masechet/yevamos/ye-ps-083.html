<div class="subject"><span class="nm">1)</span><p>DOES THE HALACHAH FOLLOW OUR MISHNAH?</p></div>
<div class="indent1"><span class="nm">(a)</span><p><span class="cl">(Rav):</span> Our Mishnah is wrong (regarding the opinion of R. Yosi), because a Beraisa teaches differently.</p></div>
<div class="indent2"><span class="nm">1.</span><p><span class="cl">(Beraisa - R. Yosi):</span> An Androginus is a species unto himself. Chachamim did not conclude if he is a male or female.</p></div>
<div class="indent1"><span class="nm">(b)</span><p><span class="cl">Objection:</span> Rather, we should rely on the Mishnah and say that the Beraisa is wrong!</p></div>
<div class="indent1"><span class="nm">(c)</span><p><span class="cl">Answer:</span> In the Mishnah, R. Yosi agreed with R. Shimon. In the Beraisa, R. Yosi speaks alone. This shows that he retracted from what he said in the Mishnah. (Nimukei Yosef - if the Tana of the Beraisa held that R. Shimon agrees with R. Yosi, he would have cited both of them. Rather, he holds that R. Shimon argues. (He did not need to explain R. Shimon, for the Mishnah did. He just comes to teach that R. Yosi retracted - <b>PF</b>.))</p></div>
<div class="indent1"><span class="nm">(d)</span><p><span class="cl">(Shmuel):</span> The Halachah does not follow the Beraisa, for the Mishnah teaches differently.</p></div>
<div class="indent1"><span class="nm">(e)</span><p><span class="cl">Question:</span> Shmuel should say the opposite, that the Halachah follows the Beraisa against the Mishnah, since Shmuel is concerned for the opinion of an individual!</p></div>
<div class="indent1"><span class="nm">(f)</span><p><span class="cl">Answer:</span> He is concerned only when this does not uproot a Mishnah.</p></div>
<div class="subject"><span class="nm">2)</span><p>PLACES WHERE THE HALACHAH FOLLOWS R. YOSI</p></div>
<div class="indent1"><span class="nm">(a)</span><p><span class="cl">(Bei Rav citing Rav):</span> The Halachah follows R. Yosi regarding Androginus (like above) and grafting (this will be explained).</p></div>
<div class="indent1"><span class="nm">(b)</span><p><span class="cl">(Shmuel):</span> The Halachah follows R. Yosi regarding birthpangs and Kidush (becoming Asur due to Kil'ayim).</p></div>
<div class="indent1"><span class="nm">(c)</span><p><span class="cl">Grafting - (Mishnah):</span> In the year before Shemitah, we do not plant, insert shoots into the ground, or graft 30 days before Rosh Hashanah. If one did, he must uproot it;</p></div>
<div class="indent1"><span class="nm">(d)</span><p>R. Yehudah says, any grafting that is not absorbed within three days will never be absorbed;</p></div>
<div class="indent1"><span class="nm">(e)</span><p>R. Yosi and R. Shimon say, two weeks are required.</p></div>
<div class="indent1"><span class="nm">(f)</span><p><span class="cl">(Rav Nachman):</span> The opinion that says 30 days requires 30 (days for absorption) and 30 (days before Rosh Hashanah due to Tosefes Shevi'is. Some Isurim of Shemitah apply to the end of the sixth year);</p></div>
<div class="indent2"><span class="nm">1.</span><p>The opinion that says three days requires three (days for absorption) and 30 (days for Tosefes Shevi'is). The last opinion requires two weeks and 30 (days).</p></div>
<div class="indent1"><span class="nm">(g)</span><p>Shmuel taught that the Halachah follows R. Yosi regarding birthpangs and Kidush.</p></div>
<div class="indent1"><span class="nm">(h)</span><p><span class="cl">Birthpangs - (Mishnah) Question:</span> For how long before a birth do we attribute blood that accompanies labor pains to the birth (so it does not make her Yoledes b'Zov)?</p></div>
<div class="indent2"><span class="nm">1.</span><p><span class="cl">Answer #1 (R. Meir):</span> It is for 40 or 50 days;</p></div>
<div class="indent2"><span class="nm">2.</span><p><span class="cl">Answer #2 (R. Yehudah):</span> It is from the beginning of the month of the birth;</p></div>
<div class="indent2"><span class="nm">3.</span><p><span class="cl">Answer #3 (R. Yosi and R. Shimon):</span> It is no more than two weeks.</p></div>
<div class="indent1"><span class="nm">(i)</span><p><span class="cl">Kidush - (Mishnah - R. Meir):</span> If one draped his vine over his neighbor's grain, he forbids it and must pay;</p></div>
<div class="indent1"><span class="nm">(j)</span><p>R. Yosi and R. Shimon say, a person cannot forbid what is not his.</p></div>

<div class="indent1"><span class="nm">(k)</span><p><span class="cl">Question:</span> How does Shmuel rule regarding Androginus?</p></div>
<div class="indent1"><span class="nm">(l)</span><p><span class="cl">Answer:</span> Shmuel told Rav Anan that because of the Mishnah we do not rule like the Beraisa.</p></div>
<div class="indent1"><span class="nm">(m)</span><p><span class="cl">Question:</span> How does Shmuel rule regarding grafting?</p></div>
<div class="indent1"><span class="nm">(n)</span><p><span class="cl">Answer:</span> Shmuel told Rav Anan like the opinion that says three and 30 days.</p></div>
<div class="indent1"><span class="nm">(o)</span><p><span class="cl">Question:</span> How does Rav rule regarding birthpangs?</p></div>
<div class="indent2"><span class="nm">1.</span><p>This question is unresolved.</p></div>
<div class="indent1"><span class="nm">(p)</span><p><span class="cl">Question:</span> How does Rav rule regarding Kidush?</p></div>
<div class="indent1"><span class="nm">(q)</span><p><span class="cl">Answer (Rav Yosef):</span> Rav Huna said in the name of Rav that the Halachah does not follow R. Yosi.</p></div>
<div class="indent1"><span class="nm">(r)</span><p><span class="cl">Objection (Abaye):</span> Why rely on that? Rav Ada said that Rav rules like R. Yosi!</p></div>
<div class="indent1"><span class="nm">(s)</span><p><span class="cl">Answer:</span> Our question was according to Bei Rav, which refers to Rav Huna!</p></div>
<div class="subject"><span class="nm">3)</span><p>CHALITZAH OF A TUMTUM</p></div>
<div class="indent1"><span class="nm">(a)</span><p><span class="cl">(Mishnah):</span> R. Yehudah says, a Tumtum (who was found to be a male... is like a Seris)....</p></div>
<div class="indent1"><span class="nm">(b)</span><p><span class="cl">Question (R. Ami):</span> How will R. Yehudah explain the Tumtum of Biri? His covering was torn and he had seven children!</p></div>
<div class="indent1"><span class="nm">(c)</span><p><span class="cl">Answer:</span> R. Yehudah says that he did not father those children.</p></div>
<div class="indent1"><span class="nm">(d)</span><p><span class="cl">(Beraisa - R. Yosi b'Rebbi Yehudah):</span> A Tumtum does not do Chalitzah, lest he be torn and it is found that a Seris Chamah did Chalitzah.</p></div>
<div class="indent1"><span class="nm">(e)</span><p><span class="cl">Objection:</span> Why is this the only concern? (Perhaps 'he' is a female!)</p></div>
<div class="indent1"><span class="nm">(f)</span><p><span class="cl">Correction:</span> Rather, we are concerned lest he be torn and found to be a female, and even if he is a male, lest he be found to be a Seris Chamah.</p></div>
<div class="indent1"><span class="nm">(g)</span><p><span class="cl">Question:</span> How is this different than R. Yehudah?</p></div>
<div class="indent1"><span class="nm">(h)</span><p><span class="cl">Answer (Rava):</span> They argue about forbidding other brothers to do Yibum, and doing Chalitzah when there are no other brothers. (R. Yehudah holds that he definitely a female or a Seris Chamah, so in any case his Chalitzah has no effect.)</p></div>
<div class="subject"><span class="nm">4)</span><p>ANDROGINUS</p></div>
<div class="indent1"><span class="nm">(a)</span><p><span class="cl">(Rav Shmuel bar Yehudah):</span> One is Chayav Skilah for Bi'ah with an Androginus in either of his openings.</p></div>
<div class="indent1"><span class="nm">(b)</span><p><span class="cl">Question (Beraisa - R. Eliezer):</span> One is Chayav Skilah for Bi'ah with an Androginus like with a male;</p></div>
<div class="indent2"><span class="nm">1.</span><p>This applies to Bi'ah in the opening that even males have (the anus). One is exempt for Bi'ah in the place of his female genitals.</p></div>
<div class="indent1"><span class="nm">(c)</span><p><span class="cl">Answer:</span> Rav rules like the following Tana.</p></div>
<div class="indent2"><span class="nm">1.</span><p><span class="cl">(Beraisa - R. Simai):</span> One is liable to be stoned for Bi'ah with an Androginus in either opening.</p></div>
<div class="indent1"><span class="nm">(d)</span><p><span class="cl">Question:</span> What is R. Simai's reason?</p></div>
<div class="indent1"><span class="nm">(e)</span><p><span class="cl">Answer (Rava):</span> "Do not lie with a male like <i>lyings</i> with a woman" refers to an Androginus, with whom one can lie in two ways.</p></div>
<div class="indent2"><span class="nm">1.</span><p>Chachamim say, even though there are two ways to lie with him, "Es Zachar" teaches that one is liable only like with a (normal) male.</p></div>
<div class="indent1"><span class="nm">(f)</span><p><span class="cl">Question:</span> What is Chachamim's source forbidding Mishkav Zachar with a regular man?</p></div>
<div class="indent1"><span class="nm">(g)</span><p><span class="cl">Answer:</span> They learn from "<i>V</i>'Es" (Bach's text).</p></div>
<div class="indent1"><span class="nm">(h)</span><p><span class="cl">Question:</span> What is the source that Bi'ah Lo k'Darkah with a woman is considered Bi'ah?</p></div>
<div class="indent1"><span class="nm">(i)</span><p><span class="cl">Answer:</span> We learn from "(Mishkevei) Ishah".</p></div>
<div class="indent1"><span class="nm">(j)</span><p><span class="cl">(Rav Shizbi):</span> R. Eliezer does not consider an Androginus to be a proper male, for if so an Androginus animal could become a Korban!</p></div>
<div class="indent1"><span class="nm">(k)</span><p><span class="cl">Question:</span> How do we know that it cannot be a Korban?</p></div>
<div class="indent1"><span class="nm">(l)</span><p><span class="cl">Answer #1 (Beraisa):</span> Any of the following birds (is Pasul for a Korban. If it was offered, it is a Neveilah (it died through Melikah, which is not Shechitah), so it) is Metamei one who eats it and his clothes:</p></div>
<div class="indent2"><span class="nm">1.</span><p>A bird that had Bi'ah with a man;</p></div>
<div class="indent2"><span class="nm">2.</span><p>One that was designated to be offered to idolatry or was worshipped;</p></div>
<div class="indent2"><span class="nm">3.</span><p>One that was given to a harlot for her services or was exchanged for a dog;</p></div>
<div class="indent2"><span class="nm">4.</span><p>A Tumtum or Androginus;</p></div>
<div class="indent1"><span class="nm">(m)</span><p>R. Eliezer says, if it was a Tumtum or Androginus his clothes do not become Tamei;</p></div>
<div class="indent2"><span class="nm">1.</span><p>R. Eliezer says, wherever it says "Male" or "female" (e.g. by animal Korbanos), this excludes Tumtum and Androginus. The Torah does not specify the gender of birds, so Tumtum and Androginus are not excluded.</p></div>
