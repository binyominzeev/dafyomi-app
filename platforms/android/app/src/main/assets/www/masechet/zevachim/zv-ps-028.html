<div class="subject"><span class="nm">1)</span><p>WHAT MAKES <i>PIGUL</i>? (cont.)</p></div>
<div class="indent1"><span class="nm">(a)</span><p><span class="cl">(Gemara):</span> (We are thinking that the skin of the tail has the same law as the tail, i.e. it is part of the Eimurim).</p></div>
<div class="indent1"><span class="nm">(b)</span><p><span class="cl">Inference:</span> Intent to eat something that should go on the Mizbe'ach is intent (to make Pigul).</p></div>
<div class="indent1"><span class="nm">(c)</span><p><span class="cl">(Shmuel):</span> Yes. The Mishnah is R. Eliezer, who says that intent to 'eat' something proper for the Mizbe'ach, or intent for the Mizbe'ach to 'eat' something proper for people, is intent.</p></div>
<div class="indent2"><span class="nm">1.</span><p><span class="cl">(Mishnah):</span> If one slaughtered a Korban with intent to eat (Chutz li'Zmano or Chutz li'Mkomo) something that is not normally eaten, or to burn (Chutz li'Zmano or Chutz li'Mkomo) something that is normally eaten burned, it is Kosher;</p></div>
<div class="indent2"><span class="nm">2.</span><p>R. Eliezer says, it is Pasul.</p></div>
<div class="indent1"><span class="nm">(d)</span><p><span class="cl">Question:</span> Our Mishnah cannot be R. Eliezer. The Seifa is unlike him!</p></div>
<div class="indent2"><span class="nm">1.</span><p>The general rule is, if one slaughtered, did Kabalah, Holachah or Zerikah with intent (Chutz) to eat something that is normally eaten, or burn something that is normally burned, (it is Pasul or Pigul).</p></div>
<div class="indent2"><span class="nm">2.</span><p><span class="cl">Inference:</span> (In the Reisha) if it is not normally eaten, it is Kosher.</p></div>
<div class="indent2"><span class="nm">3.</span><p>This is like Chachamim!</p></div>
<div class="indent1"><span class="nm">(e)</span><p><span class="cl">Answer (Shmuel):</span> Indeed, the Reisha is R. Eliezer, and the Seifa is Chachamim.</p></div>
<div class="indent1"><span class="nm">(f)</span><p><span class="cl">(Rav Huna):</span> The skin of the tail is unlike the tail.</p></div>
<div class="indent2"><span class="nm">1.</span><p><span class="cl">(Rava):</span> He learns from "<i>Chelbo</i> ha'Alyah", but not the skin of the tail.</p></div>
<div class="indent1"><span class="nm">(g)</span><p><span class="cl">(Rav Chisda):</span> Really, the skin of the tail is like the tail;</p></div>
<div class="indent2"><span class="nm">1.</span><p>The Mishnah discusses a goat (its tail is not part of the Eimurim).</p></div>
<div class="indent1"><span class="nm">(h)</span><p>Rav Huna and Rav Chisda did not explain like Shmuel, for they did not want to establish the Reisha and Seifa according to different Tana'im;</p></div>
<div class="indent1"><span class="nm">(i)</span><p>Shmuel and Rav Chisda did not explain like Rav Huna, for they hold that the skin of the tail is like the tail;</p></div>
<div class="indent1"><span class="nm">(j)</span><p><span class="cl">Question:</span> Why didn't Shmuel and Rav Huna explain like Rav Chisda?</p></div>
<div class="indent1"><span class="nm">(k)</span><p><span class="cl">Answer:</span> If so, the Mishnah teaches that the skin of the tail is like the tail. We already learn this from another Mishnah!</p></div>
<div class="indent2"><span class="nm">1.</span><p><span class="cl">(Mishnah):</span> The skins of the following are like the flesh: the skin under the tail...</p></div>
<div class="indent1"><span class="nm">(l)</span><p>Rav Chisda holds that one might have thought that that applies only to Tum'ah. Since it is soft, it joins with flesh for the required quantity for Tum'ah;</p></div>
<div class="indent2"><span class="nm">1.</span><p>One should eat Kodshim "l'Mashchah" (in grandeur), like kings eat. Kings do not normally eat skin of the tail;</p></div>
<div class="indent2"><span class="nm">2.</span><p>Therefore, the Mishnah must teach this.</p></div>
<div class="indent1"><span class="nm">(m)</span><p><span class="cl">Question (Beraisa):</span> If one slaughtered an Olah with intent to burn the skin under the tail Chutz li'Mkomo, it is Pasul, and there is no Kares. If he intended Chutz li'Zmano, it is Pigul, and one who eats the meat is Chayav Kares.</p></div>
<div class="indent2"><span class="nm">1.</span><p>Eliezer ben Yehudah says, the same applies to the skin of the feet (below the knees) of small animals, the skin of the head of a yearling calf, the skin under the tail, and the skins that Chachamim said have the same Tum'ah as the flesh;</p></div>
<div class="indent2"><span class="nm">2.</span><p>This comes to include the skin of the Ervah of a female.</p></div>
<div class="indent2"><span class="nm">3.</span><p><span class="cl">Inference:</span> The Beraisa specifies an Olah (since all the meat is burned), but the skin under the tail could not make Pigul in other Zevachim (for it is not burned with the Eimurim)!</p></div>
<div class="indent2"><span class="nm">4.</span><p>This is like Rav Huna. It is difficult for Rav Chisda!</p></div>
<div class="indent1"><span class="nm">(n)</span><p><span class="cl">Answer #1:</span> The Beraisa refers to a goat (the tail itself is not part of the Eimurim).</p></div>
<div class="indent1"><span class="nm">(o)</span><p><span class="cl">Answer #2:</span> Indeed, the Beraisa should say 'if one slaughtered a <i>Zevach</i>...' (not only an Olah).</p></div>
<div class="subject"><span class="nm">2)</span><p><i>PASUL</i> AND "PIGUL'</p></div>
<div class="indent1"><span class="nm">(a)</span><p><span class="cl">(Mishnah):</span> It is Pasul, and there is no Kares.</p></div>
<div class="indent1"><span class="nm">(b)</span><p><span class="cl">Question:</span> What is the source of this?</p></div>
<div class="indent1"><span class="nm">(c)</span><p><span class="cl">Answer (Shmuel):</span> Two verses teach about Pasul and Pigul.</p></div>
<div class="indent1"><span class="nm">(d)</span><p><span class="cl">Question:</span> What are these verses?</p></div>
<div class="indent1"><span class="nm">(e)</span><p><span class="cl">Answer (Rabah):</span> "Shelishi" refers to (intent of) Chutz li'Zmano;</p></div>
<div class="indent2"><span class="nm">1.</span><p>"Pigul" refers to Chutz li'Mkomo;</p></div>
<div class="indent2"><span class="nm">2.</span><p>"Veha'Nefesh ha'Ocheles <i>Mimenu</i> (from <i>it</i>, Avonah Tisa)". Only one of them has Kares, i.e. Chutz li'Zmano, but not Chutz li'Mkomo.</p></div>
<div class="indent1"><span class="nm">(f)</span><p><span class="cl">Question:</span> Perhaps 'Mimenu' obligates Kares for Chutz li'Mkomo, but Chutz li'Zmano has no Kares!</p></div>
<div class="indent1"><span class="nm">(g)</span><p><span class="cl">Answer #1:</span> Presumably, Chutz li'Zmano is Chayav Kares, for this was expounded earlier in the verse.</p></div>
<div class="indent1"><span class="nm">(h)</span><p><span class="cl">Rejection:</span> Just the contrary! Chutz li'Mkomo should be Chayav Kares, for this was expounded closer to "Mimenu"!</p></div>
<div class="indent1"><span class="nm">(i)</span><p><span class="cl">Answer #2 (Abaye - Beraisa):</span> In Parshas Kedoshim, it says "(v'Im He'achel Ye'achel ba'Yom) ha'Shelishi (Lo Yeratzeh)." (The verse seems to discuss eating Nosar. However, this cannot retroactively invalidate a Korban! Rather, it must discuss improper intent);</p></div>
<div class="indent2"><span class="nm">1.</span><p><span class="cl">Question:</span> We already know Chutz li'Zmano from the longer verse (above, in Tzav) "v'Im He'achel..."</p></div>
<div class="bbbline">28b----------------------------------------28b</p></div>
<div class="indent2"><span class="nm">2.</span><p><span class="cl">Answer:</span> The shorter verse (in Kedoshim) is used to teach about Chutz li'Mkomo.</p></div>
<div class="indent3"><span class="nm">i.</span><p>Regarding Nosar, it says "v'Ochlav Avono Yisa (...v'Nichresa)" - one who eat Nosar gets Kares, but not one who eats (a Korban slaughtered) Chutz li'Mkomo.</p></div>
<div class="indent2"><span class="nm">3.</span><p><span class="cl">Question:</span> Why not say oppositely, that this is Mechayev Kares for Chutz li'Zmano, and exempts Nosar from Kares! (Note - no verse about Chutz li'Zmano mentions Kares. There is a Gezerah Shavah "Avon-Avon" to learn Chutz li'Zmano either from the short verse (which is Mechayev Kares), or from eating Tamei Kodshim (which is only a Lav). It is preferable to learn the former.)</p></div>
<div class="indent2"><span class="nm">4.</span><p><span class="cl">Version #1 - Rashi - Answer #1:</span> It is preferable to explain that the short verse is Mechayev Kares for Nosar, for then we can learn the Gezerah Shavah from Nosar, for they are similar regarding ZaV (an acronym for <i>Z</i>eman (both depend on time, and both apply to a) <i>B</i>amah), but these do not apply to eating Tamei Kodshim. (Nor do they apply to Chutz li'Mkomo. If our verse taught about Chutz li'Mkomo, we would learn the Gezerah Shavah from eating Tamei Kodshim!)</p></div>
<div class="indent2"><span class="nm">5.</span><p><span class="cl">Rejection:</span> Just the contrary, it is preferable to expound it to teach about Chutz li'Mkomo, then we can learn "Avon-Avon" to Chutz li'Zmano, for they are similar regarding MiKDaSH (both depend on <i>M</i>achshavah (intent), intent for <i>K</i>etzas (part of the Korban) disqualifies the whole Korban, both apply to the Avodos with the <i>D</i>am, and regarding both of them it says <i><b>SH</b></i>elishi. (These do not apply to eating Tamei Kodshim, nor to Nosar.)</p></div>
<div class="indent2"><span class="nm">6.</span><p><span class="cl">Version #2 - Tosfos - Answer #1:</span> <span class="note">(<span>Note:</span> the tradition from Sinai for the Gezerah Shavah specified to equate the short and long verses regarding Kares.)</span> It is preferable to explain that the Gezerah Shavah equates similar things, i.e. the short verse refers to Nosar, for this resembles Chutz li'Zmano regarding ZaV.</p></div>
<div class="indent2"><span class="nm">7.</span><p><span class="cl">Rejection:</span> Just the contrary, it is better if it refers to Chutz li'Mkomo, which resembles Chutz li'Zmano regarding MiKDaSH! (end of Version #2)</p></div>
<div class="indent2"><span class="nm">8.</span><p><span class="cl">Answer #2 (R. Yochanan):</span> We learn from a Gezerah Shavah "Kodesh-Kodesh" (that eating Nosar is Chayav Kares). It says here "Es Kodesh Hash-m Chilel v'Nichrasah", and it says "v'Sarafta Es ha'Nosar (... Ki Kodesh Hu)";</p></div>
<div class="indent3"><span class="nm">i.</span><p>Therefore, "v'Ochlav Avono Yisa (...v'Nichresa)" surely refers to Nosar, and excludes Chutz li'Mkomo.</p></div>
<div class="indent1"><span class="nm">(j)</span><p><span class="cl">Objection:</span> How do we know that the long verse (which is Mechayev Kares) refers to Chutz li'Zmano, and the short verse excludes Chutz li'Mkomo from Kares? Perhaps it is just the contrary!</p></div>
<div class="indent1"><span class="nm">(k)</span><p><span class="cl">Answer #1:</span> Presumably, the long verse refers to Chutz li'Zmano, for this resembles Nosar regarding ZaV (Rashi - and therefore, we can learn a Gezerah Shavah to it from Nosar to obligate Kares; Tosfos - presumably, the Gezerah Shavah equates similar things).</p></div>
<div class="indent1"><span class="nm">(l)</span><p><span class="cl">Rejection:</span> Just the contrary, we should say that it refers to Chutz li'Mkomo, and the short verse refers to Chutz li'Zmano;</p></div>
<div class="indent2"><span class="nm">1.</span><p>Since Chutz li'Zmano resembles Nosar, one might have thought to say that also Kares applies to it, therefore the Torah had to exclude it! ("V'Ochlav" refers to one who eats it (Nosar), but not Chutz li'Zmano!)</p></div>
<div class="indent1"><span class="nm">(m)</span><p><span class="cl">Answer #2 (Rava):</span> The long verse obligates Kares for Chutz li'Zmano, and exempts Chutz li'Mkomo (like Rabah taught above):</p></div>
<div class="indent2"><span class="nm">1.</span><p>"He'achel Ye'achel" refers to two eatings, of people and the Mizbe'ach (Pigul applies to both);</p></div>
<div class="indent2"><span class="nm">2.</span><p>"Mi'Bsar Zevach Shelamav" - Pigul applies only to things like Shelamim, in which part (the blood) can (permit the rest, and through improper intent can) be Mefagel (forbid the rest) and part (the meat and Eimurim) can become Pigul (forbidden. This excludes those Menachos from which we do not take a Kometz, for one part does not permit or forbid the other.)</p></div>
<div class="indent2"><span class="nm">3.</span><p>"Ha'Shelishi" refers to Chutz li'Zmano;</p></div>
<div class="indent2"><span class="nm">4.</span><p>"Lo Yeratzeh" - becoming Pigul is like becoming acceptable;</p></div>
<div class="indent3"><span class="nm">i.</span><p>A Korban does not become Pigul until finishing all the Avodos needed for a Kosher Korban to bring Kaparah.</p></div>
<div class="indent2"><span class="nm">5.</span><p>"Ha'Makriv" - it becomes Pigul while it is being offered (with improper intent), not (like the simple understanding of the verse,) through eating it on the third day.</p></div>
<div class="indent2"><span class="nm">6.</span><p>"Oso" - the Korban becomes Pasul, but the Kohen who offered it does not.</p></div>
<div class="indent2"><span class="nm">7.</span><p>"Lo Yechashev" - it becomes Pigul only if all the Pasul intents were Chutz li'Zmano.</p></div>
<div class="indent2"><span class="nm">8.</span><p>"Pigul" refers to Chutz li'Mkomo;</p></div>
<div class="indent2"><span class="nm">9.</span><p>"Yihyeh" - improper intents join together. (If he intended to eat half a k'Zayis of meat Chutz li'Zmano and half a k'Zayis Chutz li'Mkomo, this disqualifies like intent for a k'Zayis);</p></div>
<div class="indent2"><span class="nm">10.</span><p>"Veha'Nefesh ha'Ocheles <i>Mimenu</i>" - only one of these intents has Kares;</p></div>
<div class="indent2"><span class="nm">11.</span><p><span class="cl">Question:</span> Which has Kares?</p></div>
<div class="indent2"><span class="nm">12.</span><p><span class="cl">Answer:</span> It is Chutz li'Zmano. We learn "Avon-Avon" from Nosar, which resembles it regarding ZaV.</p></div>
