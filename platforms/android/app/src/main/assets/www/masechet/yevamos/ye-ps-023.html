<div class="subject"><span class="nm">1)</span><p>THE ISUR OF ONE'S SISTER</p></div>
<div class="indent1"><span class="nm">(a)</span><p><span class="cl">Question:</span> Perhaps "Bas Eshes Avicha" comes to exclude a sister from Chayavei Lavin!</p></div>
<div class="indent1"><span class="nm">(b)</span><p><span class="cl">Answer (Rav Papa):</span> Kidushin takes effect on Chayavei Lavin:</p></div>
<div class="indent2"><span class="nm">1.</span><p><span class="cl">Question:</span> "Ki Sihyena l'Ish Shtei Nashim ha'Achas Ahuvah veha'Achas Senu'ah" - would one really think that this affects inheritance?!</p></div>
<div class="indent2"><span class="nm">2.</span><p><span class="cl">Answer:</span> Rather, the wives are "beloved" and "hated" in their marriages (the latter is forbidden), and it says Sihyena (there is Kidushin)!</p></div>
<div class="indent1"><span class="nm">(c)</span><p><span class="cl">Question:</span> Perhaps "Bas Eshes Avicha" comes to exclude a sister from Chayavei Kerisos!</p></div>
<div class="indent1"><span class="nm">(d)</span><p><span class="cl">Answer (Rava):</span> "Ervas Achoscha Vas Avicha O Vas Imecha <i>Moledes Bayis O Moledes Chutz</i>" - the Torah calls her your sister, whether or not your father may keep her mother.</p></div>
<div class="subject"><span class="nm">2)</span><p>SISTERS FROM A SLAVE OR NOCHRIS</p></div>
<div class="indent1"><span class="nm">(a)</span><p><span class="cl">Suggestion:</span> Perhaps it comes to include a sister from a Shifchah or Nochris!</p></div>
<div class="indent1"><span class="nm">(b)</span><p><span class="cl">Rejection:</span> "Bas <i>Eshes</i> Avicha" teaches that her mother could be married to your father.</p></div>
<div class="indent1"><span class="nm">(c)</span><p><span class="cl">Question:</span> (The verses do not specify what to include and exclude.) Why do we include sisters from Chayavei Kerisos and exclude sisters from a Shifchah or Nochris, and not vice-versa?</p></div>
<div class="indent1"><span class="nm">(d)</span><p><span class="cl">Answer:</span> It is more reasonable to include children from Chayavei Kerisos, since they can be married to others.</p></div>
<div class="indent1"><span class="nm">(e)</span><p><span class="cl">Objection:</span> To the contrary! A Shifchah or Nochris, if she converts, can marry your father!</p></div>
<div class="indent1"><span class="nm">(f)</span><p><span class="cl">Answer:</span> When she converts, she is a new entity.</p></div>
<div class="indent1"><span class="nm">(g)</span><p>Chachamim exclude a sister from a Shifchah or Nochris from "The woman and her children will be to her master" (they are slaves. At this point we are thinking that we learn both from the verse.)</p></div>
<div class="indent1"><span class="nm">(h)</span><p>R. Yosi b'Rebbi Yehudah uses one verse to teach about a Shifchah, and one for a Nochris. Both are needed:</p></div>
<div class="indent2"><span class="nm">1.</span><p>If there was a verse only about a Shifchah, we would have thought that this is because slaves have no lineage, but since a Nochris has lineage, her daughter is considered a sister!</p></div>
<div class="indent2"><span class="nm">2.</span><p>If there was a verse only about a Nochris, we would have thought that this is because she is not commanded in Mitzvos; but since a Shifchah is commanded in Mitzvos, her daughter is considered a sister!</p></div>
<div class="indent1"><span class="nm">(i)</span><p><span class="cl">Question:</span> We showed how Chachamim learn about a Shifchah. What is their source regarding a Nochris?</p></div>
<div class="indent2"><span class="nm">1.</span><p><span class="cl">Suggestion:</span> We learn from a Shifchah.</p></div>
<div class="indent2"><span class="nm">2.</span><p><span class="cl">Rejection:</span> We showed that one cannot learn from a Shifchah!</p></div>
<div class="indent1"><span class="nm">(j)</span><p><span class="cl">Answer (R. Yochanan):</span> "(...Do not marry your daughter to a Nochri.) For He will veer your son away from Me" - your son from a Yisraelis is called your son, but your son from a Nochris is called her son. (Rashi - He, your Nochri son-in-law, will veer <i>your</i> son, i.e. grandson. Since this grandson is from a Yisraelis (your daughter), he is called your son (he is a Yisrael). It does not say (about the Reisha of the previous verse, "Do not marry your son to a Nochris") that she (your Nochris daughter-in-law) will veer your son, for your grandson from a Nochris is not called your son (he is a Nochri). Tosfos (17a) says that "He will veer your son" refers to the Reisha. He, your son's Nochri father-in-law, will veer <i>your</i> son (from your Yisraelis wife) from Me. The Torah is not concerned about your grandson from a Nochris, for he is a Nochri.)</p></div>
<div class="indent1"><span class="nm">(k)</span><p><span class="cl">(Ravina):</span> We learn that your daughter's son fathered by a Nochri is called your son. (Tosfos - here the Torah did not express concern (<i>only</i>) about your daughter, for here we are concerned also about the grandson. He is a Yisrael, like his mother.)</p></div>
<div class="indent1"><span class="nm">(l)</span><p><span class="cl">(Version #1) Suggestion:</span> Ravina holds that the child of a slave or Nochri from a Yisraelis has proper lineage.</p></div>
<div class="indent1"><span class="nm">(m)</span><p><span class="cl">(Version #2) Suggestion:</span> Ravina holds that the child of a slave or Nochri from a Yisraelis is a Mamzer. (Since the child is a Yisrael, Mamzerus applies!) (end of Version #2)</p></div>
<div class="indent1"><span class="nm">(n)</span><p><span class="cl">Rejection:</span> The child is not a Mamzer, nor is his lineage proper. He is called a Yisrael Pasul (to Kehunah).</p></div>
<div class="indent1"><span class="nm">(o)</span><p><span class="cl">Question:</span> "Do not intermarry with them" discusses the seven Kena'ani nations! (What is the source for other nations?)</p></div>
<div class="indent1"><span class="nm">(p)</span><p><span class="cl">Answer:</span> "He will veer" includes anyone that makes veer (i.e. all Nochrim).</p></div>
<div class="indent1"><span class="nm">(q)</span><p><span class="cl">Question:</span> This is like R. Shimon, who derives laws based on (our understanding of) the purpose of Mitzvos. What is Chachamim's source?</p></div>
<div class="indent1"><span class="nm">(r)</span><p><span class="cl">Answer:</span> The Chachamim who disagree with R. Yosi bar Yehudah hold like R. Shimon.</p></div>

<div class="subject"><span class="nm">3)</span><p>DOUBTFUL KIDUSHIN</p></div>
<div class="indent1"><span class="nm">(a)</span><p><span class="cl">(Mishnah):</span> If a man was Mekadesh one of two sisters and does not know which, he divorces both;</p></div>
<div class="indent1"><span class="nm">(b)</span><p>If he died leaving one brother, he does Chalitzah to both. If he left two brothers, one does Chalitzah and the other Yibum. If both did Yibum, they may keep their wives.</p></div>
<div class="indent1"><span class="nm">(c)</span><p>If Reuven and David were Mekadesh Rachel and Leah (sisters) and each is unsure whom he was Mekadesh, each divorces both;</p></div>
<div class="indent1"><span class="nm">(d)</span><p>If each died leaving one brother, each brother does Chalitzah to both. If Reuven left one brother and David left two, Reuven's brother does Chalitzah to both. One of David's brothers does Chalitzah and one does Yibum. If both did Yibum, they may keep their wives.</p></div>
<div class="indent1"><span class="nm">(e)</span><p>If Reuven and David have two brothers each, one brother of Reuven does Chalitzah with (e.g. Leah) and one brother of David does Chalitzah with Rachel. Reuven's other brother does Yibum with Rachel and David's other brother does Yibum with Leah;</p></div>
<div class="indent1"><span class="nm">(f)</span><p>If both of Reuven's brothers did Chalitzah, Shimon's brothers may not both do Yibum. One must do Chalitzah and the other may do Yibum. If both did Yibum, they may keep their wives.</p></div>
<div class="indent1"><span class="nm">(g)</span><p><span class="cl">(Gemara) Suggestion:</span> This teaches that Kidushin she'Ein Mesurin l'Vi'ah (Tosfos - the Kidushin itself forbids Bi'ah with her, e.g. because we are unsure if he was Mekadesh her sister) takes effect!</p></div>
<div class="indent1"><span class="nm">(h)</span><p><span class="cl">Rejection:</span> No. At the time of Kidushin, he knew which he was Mekadesh. Later, he became unsure.</p></div>
<div class="indent2"><span class="nm">1.</span><p>The wording of the Mishnah proves this. It says '<i>he</i> does not know', and not '<i>it is not known</i>'.</p></div>
<div class="indent1"><span class="nm">(i)</span><p><span class="cl">Question:</span> If so, what is the Chidush?</p></div>
<div class="indent1"><span class="nm">(j)</span><p><span class="cl">Answer:</span> When he dies leaving two brothers, one must do Chalitzah before the other does Yibum. If not, (perhaps) he has Bi'ah with the sister of his (true) Yevamah.</p></div>
<div class="indent1"><span class="nm">(k)</span><p><span class="cl">(Mishnah):</span> If two men were Mekadesh two sisters...</p></div>
<div class="indent1"><span class="nm">(l)</span><p><span class="cl">Suggestion:</span> This teaches that Kidushin she'Ein Mesurin l'Vi'ah takes effect!</p></div>
<div class="indent1"><span class="nm">(m)</span><p><span class="cl">Rejection:</span> No. At the time, each knew which he was Mekadesh. Later, they became mixed up.</p></div>
<div class="indent2"><span class="nm">1.</span><p><span class="cl">Support:</span> It says 'he does not know', and not 'it is not known.'</p></div>
<div class="indent1"><span class="nm">(n)</span><p><span class="cl">Question:</span> If so, what is the Chidush?</p></div>
<div class="indent1"><span class="nm">(o)</span><p><span class="cl">Answer:</span> If one left one brother and the other left two, the lone brother does Chalitzah to both.</p></div>
<div class="indent2"><span class="nm">1.</span><p><span class="cl">Objection:</span> We learned this already!</p></div>
<div class="indent2"><span class="nm">2.</span><p><span class="cl">Answer:</span> We would have thought that we forbid in this case due to the case when each has only one brother.</p></div>
<div class="indent2"><span class="nm">3.</span><p>The lone brother must do Chalitzah before the Yibum, for perhaps the woman doing Yibum is the Yevamah of the lone brother.</p></div>
<div class="indent1"><span class="nm">(p)</span><p><span class="cl">(Mishnah):</span> If each left two brothers...</p></div>
<div class="indent1"><span class="nm">(q)</span><p><span class="cl">Question:</span> What does this teach that we have not already learned?</p></div>
<div class="indent1"><span class="nm">(r)</span><p><span class="cl">Answer:</span> One might have thought that we decree not to do Yibum, lest they do Yibum before Chalitzah.</p></div>
