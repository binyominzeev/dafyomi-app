<p class="bas indent1"><span class="nm">(a)</span><span class="cl">Answer #2 (Rav Ashi):</span> The Mishnah discusses a valley enclosed by walls.</p>
<p class="bas indent2"><span class="nm">1.</span><span class="cl">(Ula):</span> If a Karfef (a Chatzer without houses open to it) more than Beis Sa'atayim (5000 square Amos) was surrounded by a wall, but not for the sake of dwelling, [it is forbidden to carrying four Amos inside, yet] one who throws to it [from Reshus ha'Rabim] is liable;</p>
<p class="bas indent2"><span class="nm">2.</span>The same applies even if it is more than a Beis Kor (75,000 square Amos) or two.</p>
<p class="bas indent2"><span class="nm">3.</span><span class="cl">Question:</span> What is the reason?</p>
<p class="bas indent2"><span class="nm">4.</span><span class="cl">Answer:</span> The Karfef has a proper wall, just it lacks residents [it is a Reshus ha'Yachid mid'Oraisa, mid'Rabanan we are stringent to consider it a Karmelis].</p>
<p class="bas indent1"><span class="nm">(b)</span><span class="cl">Question:</span> We understand why Rav Ashi did not answer like Ula (see (d) below);</p>
<p class="bas indent2"><span class="nm">1.</span>Why didn't Ula answer like his teaching?</p>
<p class="bas indent1"><span class="nm">(c)</span><span class="cl">Answer:</span> He holds that the Tana would not call it 'valley' if it had walls, rather, 'Karfef'.</p>
<p class="bas indent1"><span class="nm">(d)</span>Rav Ashi holds that since the Tana called it Reshus ha'Yachid, surely it is Reshus ha'Yachid mid'Oraisa.</p>
<p class="bas indent1"><span class="nm">(e)</span><span class="cl">(Beraisa):</span> [A sea, valley, platform,] or Karmelis...</p>
<p class="bas indent1"><span class="nm">(f)</span><span class="cl">Question:</span> The things listed beforehand are also Karmelis!</p>
<p class="bas indent1"><span class="nm">(g)</span><span class="cl">Answer (Rav Dimi):</span> 'Karmelis' includes a corner next to Reshus ha'Rabim (e.g. someone's property bordered Reshus ha'Rabim, and his house jutted out - he allowed Reshus ha'Rabim to 'annex' the property next to his house)</p>
<p class="bas indent2"><span class="nm">1.</span>Even though sometimes it is crowded in Reshus ha'Rabim and people enter this area, since it is inconvenient (one must return to the main road when he encounters the house) it is [not Reshus ha'Rabim, only] Karmelis.</p>
<p class="bas indent1"><span class="nm">(h)</span><span class="cl">(Rav Dimi):</span> Between the pillars [in the market, where merchants hang their wares] is a Karmelis.</p>
<p class="bas indent1"><span class="nm">(i)</span><span class="cl">Question:</span> What is the reason?</p>
<p class="bas indent1"><span class="nm">(j)</span><span class="cl">Answer:</span> Even though many people go there, since it is inconvenient, it is [not Reshus ha'Rabim, only] Karmelis.</p>
<p class="bas indent1"><span class="nm">(k)</span><span class="cl">(R. Zeira):</span> The platform in front of the pillars is a Karmelis.</p>
<p class="bas indent1"><span class="nm">(l)</span>Rav Dimi said that between the pillars is a Karmelis, all the more so he holds that the platform is a Karmelis;</p>
<p class="bas indent1"><span class="nm">(m)</span><span class="cl">Version #1:</span> R. Zeira said that the platform is a Karmelis, but he would hold that between the pillars is not so inconvenient, it is [Reshus ha'Rabim,] not Karmelis.</p>
<p class="bas indent1"><span class="nm">(n)</span><span class="cl">Version #2:</span> Between the pillars is Reshus ha'Rabim, because sometimes people walk there.</p>
<p class="bas subject"><span class="nm">2)</span>THE EXTENT OF <i>KARMELIS</i></p>
<p class="bas indent1"><span class="nm">(a)</span><span class="cl">(Rabah bar Shila):</span> If one threw something [four Amos] in Reshus ha'Rabim at (and it stuck to) the side of a brick standing upright in Reshus ha'Rabim, he is liable (it is as if rested on the ground below);</p>
<p class="bas indent1"><span class="nm">(b)</span>If it landed on top, [this is not considered Reshus ha'Rabim], he is exempt.</p>
<p class="bas indent1"><span class="nm">(c)</span><span class="cl">(Abaye and Rava):</span> This is only if the brick is [at least] three Tefachim tall - if not, many people trample on it (even the top is [Batul to] Reshus ha'Rabim);</p>
<p class="bas indent2"><span class="nm">1.</span>Regarding prickly bushes, even if they are not three Tefachim [they are not Reshus ha'Rabim, for people do not step on them].</p>
<p class="bas indent1"><span class="nm">(d)</span><span class="cl">(Chiya bar Rav):</span> Prickly bushes are Reshus ha'Rabim [people wearing shoes step on them], but excrement is not (people do not walk on it).</p>
<p class="bas indent1"><span class="nm">(e)</span><span class="cl">(Rav Ashi):</span> Even excrement is Reshus ha'Rabim (anything less than three tall is Batul to Reshus ha'Rabim, even if people do not walk on it).</p>
<p class="bas indent1"><span class="nm">(f)</span><span class="cl">(Rav Dimi):</span> Karmelis does not apply to an area less than four [by four Tefachim].</p>
<p class="bas indent1"><span class="nm">(g)</span><span class="cl">(Rav Sheshes):</span> Karmelis applies up to 10 [Tefachim above the ground].</p>
<p class="bas indent1"><span class="nm">(h)</span><span class="cl">Question:</span> What does this mean?</p>
<p class="bas indent2"><span class="nm">1.</span><span class="cl">Suggestion:</span> Karmelis applies only if there is a wall 10 Tefachim tall.</p>
<p class="bas indent2"><span class="nm">2.</span><span class="cl">Rejection:</span> Rav Gidal taught that if the interior of a house is less than 10, and the roof completes the Shi'ur of 10, one may carry anywhere on the roof (it is Reshus ha'Yachid), one may not carry four Amos inside (it is Karmelis).</p>
<p class="bas indent1"><span class="nm">(i)</span><span class="cl">Answer:</span> It means, until 10 Tefachim off the ground is Karmelis, above is not (it is Makom Petur), like Shmuel taught to Rav Yehudah.</p>
<p class="bas indent1"><span class="nm">(j)</span><span class="cl">(Shmuel):</span> No laws of Shabbos apply above 10 Tefachim.</p>
<p class="bas indent1"><span class="nm">(k)</span><span class="cl">Question:</span> What does Shmuel teach?</p>
<p class="bas indent2"><span class="nm">1.</span><span class="cl">Suggestion:</span> He teaches that Reshus ha'Yachid does not apply above 10.</p>
<p class="bas indent2"><span class="nm">2.</span><span class="cl">Rejection:</span> Rav Chisda taught, if one erects a beam in Reshus ha'Yachid with a basket on top, even if it is 100 Amos tall, one who throws something into it from Reshus ha'Rabim is liable, for Reshus ha'Yachid extends to the sky.</p>
<p class="bas bbbline">7b----------------------------------------7b</p>
<p class="bas indent1"><span class="nm">(l)</span><span class="cl">Answer #1:</span> He teaches that Reshus ha'Rabim does not apply above 10.</p>
<p class="bas indent1"><span class="nm">(m)</span><span class="cl">Rejection:</span> We already learn this from a Mishnah!</p>
<p class="bas indent2"><span class="nm">1.</span><span class="cl">(Mishnah):</span> If one threw something four Amos [in Reshus ha'Rabim] at (and it stuck to) a wall:</p>
<p class="bas indent3"><span class="nm">i.</span>If this was above 10 Tefachim [he is exempt], it is as if he threw in the air (i.e. and it never landed);</p>
<p class="bas indent3"><span class="nm">ii.</span>If this was below 10 Tefachim [he is liable], it is as if he threw on the ground.</p>
<p class="bas indent1"><span class="nm">(n)</span><span class="cl">Answer #2:</span> He teaches that Karmelis does not apply above 10.</p>
<p class="bas indent1"><span class="nm">(o)</span>Chachamim gave the leniencies of Reshus ha'Yachid and Reshus ha'Rabim to Karmelis:</p>
<p class="bas indent2"><span class="nm">1.</span>It has the leniency of Reshus ha'Yachid, that it does not apply to an area less than four by four Tefachim;</p>
<p class="bas indent2"><span class="nm">2.</span>It has the leniency of Reshus ha'Rabim, that it does not apply above 10.</p>
<p class="bas subject"><span class="nm">3)</span>CHOREI RESHUS HA'YACHID AND CHOREI RESHUS HA'RABIM</p>
<p class="bas indent1"><span class="nm">(a)</span><span class="cl">(Rav Gidal):</span> If the interior of a house is less than 10, and the roof completes the Shi'ur of 10, one may carry anywhere on the roof, one may not carry four Amos inside.</p>
<p class="bas indent1"><span class="nm">(b)</span><span class="cl">(Abaye):</span> If one dug out a cavity four by four in the floor, so that the interior height of the house in that place is 10, it is permitted to carry in the entire house.</p>
<p class="bas indent1"><span class="nm">(c)</span><span class="cl">Question:</span> What is the reason?</p>
<p class="bas indent1"><span class="nm">(d)</span><span class="cl">Answer:</span> (The place of the cavity is a proper Reshus ha'Yachid (it need not be adjacent to the walls),) the rest of the house is like Chorei [holes coming out from] Reshus ha'Yachid, they are like Reshus ha'Yachid:</p>
<p class="bas indent2"><span class="nm">1.</span>Chorei Reshus ha'Yachid are like Reshus ha'Yachid;</p>
<p class="bas indent2"><span class="nm">2.</span><span class="cl">(Abaye):</span> Chorei Reshus ha'Rabim are like Reshus ha'Rabim;</p>
<p class="bas indent2"><span class="nm">3.</span><span class="cl">(Rava):</span> They are not like Reshus ha'Rabim.</p>
<p class="bas indent1"><span class="nm">(e)</span><span class="cl">Question (Rava, against Abaye):</span> Rav Dimi taught that 'Karmelis' (in the Beraisa 6A) includes a corner next to Reshus ha'Rabim - it is Chorei Reshus ha'Rabim, according to you it is like Reshus ha'Rabim!</p>
<p class="bas indent1"><span class="nm">(f)</span><span class="cl">Answer (Abaye):</span> It is not like Reshus ha'Rabim because it is inconvenient to use them (walk there) - regular Chorei Reshus ha'Rabim are convenient to use.</p>
<p class="bas indent1"><span class="nm">(g)</span><span class="cl">Question (against Abaye - Mishnah):</span> If one threw something four Amos at a wall:</p>
<p class="bas indent2"><span class="nm">1.</span>If this was above 10, it is as if he threw in the air; if this was below 10, it is as if he threw on the ground.</p>
<p class="bas indent2"><span class="nm">2.</span><span class="cl">Question:</span> When it was below 10, why is he liable - it was not Nach [outside of four Amos, for it bounces back]!</p>
<p class="bas indent2"><span class="nm">3.</span><span class="cl">Answer (R. Yochanan):</span> The case is, he threw a fat fig cake [it stuck to the wall].</p>
<p class="bas indent2"><span class="nm">4.</span><span class="cl">Summation of question:</span> According to Abaye, R. Yochanan could have established the Mishnah to discuss a pebble or object that landed in a hole in the wall, i.e. Chorei Reshus ha'Rabim!</p>
<p class="bas indent1"><span class="nm">(h)</span><span class="cl">Answer #1 (Abaye):</span> A pebble or object would probably bounce off and not land in the hole.</p>
<p class="bas indent1"><span class="nm">(i)</span><span class="cl">Answer #2 (Abaye):</span> The Mishnah discusses a wall without a hole.</p>
<p class="bas indent1"><span class="nm">(j)</span><span class="cl">Question:</span> What is the source to say this?</p>
<p class="bas indent1"><span class="nm">(k)</span><span class="cl">Answer:</span> The Reisha says, if it was above 10, it is as if he threw in the air - if there is a hole [and it landed inside], this is not like throwing in the air [it is Chorei Reshus ha'Yachid, he is liable]!</p>
<p class="bas indent1"><span class="nm">(l)</span><span class="cl">Suggestion:</span> Perhaps the case is, the wall is not four by four (therefore, above 10 is not Chorei Reshus ha'Yachid)!</p>
<p class="bas indent1"><span class="nm">(m)</span><span class="cl">Rejection:</span> Rav Yehudah taught that if one threw above 10 and it landed in a hole of any size [less than four by four], R. Meir and Chachamim argue about whether or not he is liable:</p>
<p class="bas indent2"><span class="nm">1.</span>R. Meir says [regarding Mezuzah, and would also say here] Chokekim Lehashlim (if there is a small hole in something thick, we consider it as if the entire thickness was carved out - therefore, if the wall is four by four, it is as if the hole is four by four);</p>
<p class="bas indent2"><span class="nm">2.</span>Chachamim do not say Chokekim Lehashlim.</p>
<p class="bas indent2"><span class="nm">3.</span>Since we may assume that our Stam Mishnah is like R. Meir, it must be that there is no hole.</p>
<p class="bas indent1"><span class="nm">(n)</span><span class="cl">(Rav Chisda):</span> If one erects a beam in Reshus ha'Yachid with a basket on top, even if it is 100 Amos tall, one who throws something into it from Reshus ha'Rabim is liable, for Reshus ha'Yachid extends to the sky.</p>
<p class="bas indent1"><span class="nm">(o)</span><span class="cl">Suggestion:</span> This is like Rebbi:</p>
<p class="bas indent2"><span class="nm">1.</span><span class="cl">(Beraisa - Rebbi):</span> If one threw something [in Reshus ha'Rabim] and it landed on a ledge of any size, he is liable;</p>
<p class="bas indent2"><span class="nm">2.</span>Chachamim exempt.</p>
<p class="bas indent1"><span class="nm">(p)</span><span class="cl">Rejection (Abaye):</span> No, all agree to Rav Chisda's law in Reshus ha'Yachid - the Beraisa discusses a tree in Reshus ha'Yachid, its foliage hangs in Reshus ha'Rabim, the thrown object landed on the foliage;</p>
<p class="bas indent2"><span class="nm">1.</span>Rebbi applies the status of the trunk (i.e. a Reshus ha'Yachid that is four by four) to the foliage, Chachamim do not.</p>
