<div class="subject"><span class="nm">1)</span><p>ARE WE CONCERNED FOR OTHER PEOPLE WITH THE SAME NAME? (cont.)</p></div>
<div class="indent1"><span class="nm">(a)</span><p><span class="cl">Support (Rava, for himself):</span> There were two documents in Mechuza in which the lenders were Chavi bar Nanai and Nanai bar Chavi. Rabah bar Avuha authorized collection of both of them. These are common names in Mechuza (nevertheless we are not concerned for others of the same name!)</p></div>
<div class="indent1"><span class="nm">(b)</span><p><span class="cl">Rejection (Abaye):</span> Even if we were concerned that others have the same name, there is no concern (why the bearer should not collect)!</p></div>
<div class="indent2"><span class="nm">1.</span><p>We are not concerned lest the lender dropped it, for people are careful with documents!</p></div>
<div class="indent2"><span class="nm">2.</span><p>We are not concerned lest the lender deposited it with the current bearer. Since they have the same name, he would not deposit it by him!</p></div>
<div class="indent2"><span class="nm">3.</span><p><span class="cl">Suggestion:</span> Perhaps the lender gave it to the current bearer.</p></div>
<div class="indent2"><span class="nm">4.</span><p><span class="cl">Rejection:</span> If so he is entitled to collect, for handing over a document is a proper acquisition!</p></div>
<div class="indent1"><span class="nm">(c)</span><p>A Get was found in Sura. It said 'In Sura, I, Anan bar Chiya of Nehardai, divorce my wife Plonis.'</p></div>
<div class="indent1"><span class="nm">(d)</span><p>Chachamim checked from Sura to Nehardai. The only other Anan bar Chiya they found was from Chigra and lived in Neharda'a. Witnesses said that he was in Nehardai the day that the Get was written.</p></div>
<div class="indent1"><span class="nm">(e)</span><p><span class="cl">Abaye:</span> Even though normally I say that we must be concerned, here there is no concern. Since he was in Nehardai, he could not have written a Get in Sura.</p></div>
<div class="indent1"><span class="nm">(f)</span><p><span class="cl">Rava:</span> Even though normally I say that we are not concerned, here we are concerned. Perhaps he went on a fast camel, or by use of a name of Hash-m, or he had previously authorized the Get to be written.</p></div>
<div class="indent2"><span class="nm">1.</span><p><span class="cl">Rav Safra and Rav Huna (to scribes):</span> When you are in Shili, write Shili on the document, even though you were in Hini when asked to write it. When you are in Hini, write Hini, even though you were in Shili when asked to write it.</p></div>
<div class="indent1"><span class="nm">(g)</span><p><span class="cl">Question:</span> What was the final ruling about the sesame?</p></div>
<div class="indent1"><span class="nm">(h)</span><p><span class="cl">Answer #1 (Rav Yemar):</span> We are not concerned (lest he cleared it out and this is different sesame).</p></div>
<div class="indent1"><span class="nm">(i)</span><p><span class="cl">Answer #2 (Ravina):</span> We are concerned.</p></div>
<div class="indent1"><span class="nm">(j)</span><p>The Halachah is, we are concerned.</p></div>
<div class="subject"><span class="nm">2)</span><p>WHEN THEY WERE QUARRELING</p></div>
<div class="indent1"><span class="nm">(a)</span><p><span class="cl">(Mishnah):</span> If they were quarreling (she is not believed).</p></div>
<div class="indent1"><span class="nm">(b)</span><p><span class="cl">Question:</span> What is the case of a quarrel?</p></div>
<div class="indent1"><span class="nm">(c)</span><p><span class="cl">Answer (Rav Yehudah):</span> She tells him 'divorce me.'</p></div>
<div class="indent1"><span class="nm">(d)</span><p><span class="cl">Objection:</span> All women say this [when they are angry]!</p></div>
<div class="indent1"><span class="nm">(e)</span><p><span class="cl">Correction:</span> Rather, she says 'you divorced me.'</p></div>
<div class="indent1"><span class="nm">(f)</span><p><span class="cl">Question:</span> She should be believed, like Rav Hamnuna taught!</p></div>
<div class="indent2"><span class="nm">1.</span><p><span class="cl">(Rav Hamnuna):</span> If a woman says to her husband 'you divorced me', she is believed.</p></div>
<div class="indent2"><span class="nm">2.</span><p>There is a Chazakah that she could not be so impudent to lie to her husband about this.</p></div>
<div class="indent1"><span class="nm">(g)</span><p><span class="cl">Answer:</span> The case is, she named the witnesses in front of whom she was divorced, and the witnesses deny this.</p></div>
<div class="indent1"><span class="nm">(h)</span><p><span class="cl">Question:</span> Why isn't a woman believed when they were quarreling?</p></div>
<div class="indent1"><span class="nm">(i)</span><p><span class="cl">Answer #1 (R. Chanina):</span> We are concerned lest she lie.</p></div>
<div class="indent1"><span class="nm">(j)</span><p><span class="cl">Answer #2 (Rav Simi bar Ashi):</span> We are concerned lest she testify from estimation.</p></div>
<div class="bbbline">116b----------------------------------------116b</p></div>
<div class="indent2"><span class="nm">1.</span><p>They argue about a case in which he started the quarrel (she would not lie, but she would testify from estimation).</p></div>
<div class="indent1"><span class="nm">(k)</span><p><span class="cl">Question:</span> Is one witness believed when they were quarreling?</p></div>
<div class="indent2"><span class="nm">1.</span><p>If one witness is normally believed (to say that a man died) because people do not lie about something Avid l'Igluyei, here also the witness would not lie;</p></div>
<div class="indent2"><span class="nm">2.</span><p>If he is believed because she investigates before remarrying, here she will not check.</p></div>
<div class="indent2"><span class="nm">3.</span><p>This question is unresolved.</p></div>
<div class="indent1"><span class="nm">(l)</span><p><span class="cl">(Mishnah):</span> R. Yehudah says, she is believed (only if she returns crying and her clothes are torn).</p></div>
<div class="indent1"><span class="nm">(m)</span><p><span class="cl">(Beraisa - Chachamim (to R. Yehudah)):</span> According to you, a clever woman will be permitted, but a simple woman will be forbidden! Rather, whether or not she is crying she is permitted.</p></div>
<div class="indent1"><span class="nm">(n)</span><p>A woman entered R. Yehudah's Beis Din. They told her to eulogize her husband, tear her garments and undo her hair.</p></div>
<div class="indent1"><span class="nm">(o)</span><p><span class="cl">Question:</span> They teach her to lie!</p></div>
<div class="indent1"><span class="nm">(p)</span><p><span class="cl">Answer:</span> They hold like Chachamim. They wanted that R. Yehudah would permit her.</p></div>
<div class="subject"><span class="nm">3)</span><p>WHEN IS SHE BELIEVED?</p></div>
<div class="indent1"><span class="nm">(a)</span><p><span class="cl">(Mishnah - Beis Hillel):</span> We heard that she is believed only when she comes from the (grain) harvest, in the same province, like the case that occurred.</p></div>
<div class="indent1"><span class="nm">(b)</span><p><span class="cl">Beis Shamai:</span> It is the same whether she comes from the grain harvest, the olive harvest, or the grape harvest, or from one province to another. Chachamim merely discussed the usual case.</p></div>
<div class="indent2"><span class="nm">1.</span><p>Beis Hillel retracted and agreed to Beis Shamai.</p></div>
<div class="indent1"><span class="nm">(c)</span><p><span class="cl">(Gemara - Beraisa - Beis Shamai (to Beis Hillel)):</span> According to you, we know only that she is believed during the wheat harvest. What is the source that she is believed during the harvest of barley, grapes, olives, dates and figs?</p></div>
<div class="indent2"><span class="nm">1.</span><p>We must say that the case was during the wheat harvest, but the same applies to all harvests;</p></div>
<div class="indent2"><span class="nm">2.</span><p>Likewise, the case was in the same province, but the same applies to if they were in different provinces!</p></div>
<div class="indent1"><span class="nm">(d)</span><p><span class="cl">Beis Hillel:</span> Within the same province there is much traffic, so she is afraid to lie (lest witnesses contradict her). From a different province people do not come often, so she is not afraid to lie.</p></div>
<div class="indent1"><span class="nm">(e)</span><p>Beis Shamai say, even from a different province, caravans are common (so she is afraid to lie).</p></div>
<div class="indent1"><span class="nm">(f)</span><p><span class="cl">Question:</span> What was the case that occurred?</p></div>
<div class="indent1"><span class="nm">(g)</span><p><span class="cl">Answer (Rav Yehudah):</span> In the end of the wheat harvest 10 men went to harvest wheat. One was bitten by a snake and died. His wife came and told Beis Din. They verified her story;</p></div>
<div class="indent2"><span class="nm">1.</span><p>They decreed that a woman who says that her husband died may remarry or do Yibum.</p></div>
<div class="indent1"><span class="nm">(h)</span><p><span class="cl">Suggestion:</span> The following Tana'im argue as Beis Shamai and Beis Hillel do:</p></div>
<div class="indent2"><span class="nm">1.</span><p><span class="cl">(Beraisa):</span> One may not transport Mei Chatas (water sanctified with ashes of Parah Adumah) or the ashes across the Yarden River, or in a boat. He may not throw it across a river, float it across, send it across on an animal or with a person being carried across, unless the carrier's feet touch the ground. He may take it across a bridge;</p></div>
<div class="indent2"><span class="nm">2.</span><p>This applies to all rivers.</p></div>
<div class="indent2"><span class="nm">3.</span><p>R. Chananya ben Akiva says, they forbade only in a boat across the Yarden, like the case that occurred (brought below).</p></div>
<div class="indent2"><span class="nm">4.</span><p><span class="cl">Suggestion:</span> Chachamim hold like Beis Shamai, and R. Chananya holds like Beis Hillel.</p></div>
<div class="indent1"><span class="nm">(i)</span><p><span class="cl">Rejection #1:</span> Chachamim can hold even like Beis Hillel;</p></div>
<div class="indent2"><span class="nm">1.</span><p>Beis Hillel require her to be in the same province, for she is not afraid to lie if it is far away. Here there is no reason to distinguish the Yarden from other rivers.</p></div>
<div class="indent1"><span class="nm">(j)</span><p>Rejection #R. Chananya can hold even like Beis Shamai;</p></div>
<div class="indent2"><span class="nm">1.</span><p>Beis Shamai say that she is believed even from a different province, for she will investigate well whether it is close or far. Here, we decreed only like the case that occurred, in a boat on the Yarden.</p></div>
<div class="indent1"><span class="nm">(k)</span><p><span class="cl">Question:</span> What was the case in the boat?</p></div>
<div class="indent1"><span class="nm">(l)</span><p><span class="cl">Answer (Rav Yehudah):</span> A man was carrying Mei Chatas and ashes of the Parah Adumah in a boat on the Yarden. Flesh of a corpse was found in the ship's bottom, which made the water and ashes Teme'im;</p></div>
<div class="indent2"><span class="nm">1.</span><p>They decreed not to transport Mei Chatas or the ashes in a boat on the Yarden.</p></div>
<div class="subject"><span class="nm">4)</span><p>REGARDING WHAT IS SHE BELIEVED?</p></div>
<div class="indent1"><span class="nm">(a)</span><p><span class="cl">(Mishnah - Beis Shamai):</span> She may remarry and she receives her Kesuvah;</p></div>
<div class="indent1"><span class="nm">(b)</span><p>Beis Hillel say, she may remarry, but does not receive the Kesuvah.</p></div>
<div class="indent1"><span class="nm">(c)</span><p><span class="cl">Beis Shamai:</span> If she is believed to permit Ervah (Eshes Ish), which is stringent, all the more so she is believed about money, which is lenient!</p></div>
<div class="indent1"><span class="nm">(d)</span><p><span class="cl">Beis Hillel:</span> We find that the children do not inherit based on her testimony.</p></div>
