<p class="bas subject"><span class="nm">1)</span>DOCUMENTS TO SELL SLAVES</p>
<p class="bas indent1"><span class="nm">(a)</span><span class="cl">(Mishnah):</span> The essential part of a Get of freedom is 'you are a free woman' or 'you are to yourself.'</p>
<p class="bas indent1"><span class="nm">(b)</span>Rav Yehudah enacted to write in documents of sale of slaves 'this slave is free from any claims of freedom, partnership, accusations and allegations of the king or kingdom” (a death sentence). He is free of any blemish or boils (that will come) on his face for two years, new or old.'</p>
<p class="bas indent2"><span class="nm">1.</span><span class="cl">Question:</span> If boils come, what is the cure?</p>
<p class="bas indent2"><span class="nm">2.</span><span class="cl">Answer:</span> A feather is used to anoint him with ginger...</p>
<p class="bas subject"><span class="nm">2)</span><i>GITIN</i> THAT WORK <i>B'DI'EVED</i></p>
<p class="bas indent1"><span class="nm">(a)</span><span class="cl">(Mishnah):</span> Three kinds of Gitin are Pasul, but if she remarried, the children are Kosher (not Mamzerim):</p>
<p class="bas indent2"><span class="nm">1.</span>It is written in Kesav Yado (his, i.e. the husband's, own handwriting), but witnesses did not sign it;</p>
<p class="bas indent2"><span class="nm">2.</span>Witnesses signed it, but there is no date on it;</p>
<p class="bas indent2"><span class="nm">3.</span>It has a date, and only one witness signed it.</p>
<p class="bas indent3"><span class="nm">i.</span>If she remarried relying on any of these three Gitin, the children are not Mamzerim.</p>
<p class="bas indent1"><span class="nm">(b)</span>R. Elazar says, even if no witnesses signed on it, but it was given in front of witnesses, it is valid, and this suffices to collect from Meshubadim (land that was sold).</p>
<p class="bas indent2"><span class="nm">1.</span>Witnesses sign a Get only due to an enactment for Tikun ha'Olam.</p>
<p class="bas indent1"><span class="nm">(c)</span><span class="cl">(Gemara) Question:</span> Are there no other such Gitin?!</p>
<p class="bas indent2"><span class="nm">1.</span><span class="cl">Question #1:</span> Also an old Get (they were secluded after it was written) is Pasul (but if she remarried, the children are Kosher)!</p>
<p class="bas indent2"><span class="nm">2.</span><span class="cl">Answer:</span> There, she need not leave her new husband. Here (if one remarried with a Get of our Mishnah), she must leave.</p>
<p class="bas indent2"><span class="nm">3.</span><span class="cl">Question:</span> Some hold that also here, she need not leave. How can they answer the question?</p>
<p class="bas indent2"><span class="nm">4.</span><span class="cl">Answer:</span> Here, she may not remarry l'Chatchilah. One who received an old Get may remarry l'Chatchilah.</p>
<p class="bas indent2"><span class="nm">5.</span><span class="cl">Question #2:</span> A bald Get (it has more folds than witnesses) is Pasul!</p>
<p class="bas indent2"><span class="nm">6.</span><span class="cl">Answer:</span> There, if she married, the children are Mamzerim!</p>
<p class="bas indent2"><span class="nm">7.</span><span class="cl">Question:</span> That is only according to R. Meir (who says that if one remarries based on a Get that deviates from Chachamim's guidelines, the children are Mamzerim);</p>
<p class="bas indent3"><span class="nm">i.</span>According to Chachamim, the children are not Mamzerim. How can they answer?</p>
<p class="bas indent2"><span class="nm">8.</span><span class="cl">Answer:</span> One who received a bald Get must leave her new husband. Here, she need not.</p>
<p class="bas indent2"><span class="nm">9.</span><span class="cl">Question:</span> Some hold that here, she must leave. How can they answer?</p>
<p class="bas indent2"><span class="nm">10.</span><span class="cl">Answer:</span> Our Mishnah discusses regular (untied) Gitin.</p>
<p class="bas indent2"><span class="nm">11.</span><span class="cl">Question #3:</span> A Get dated according to the wrong kingdom is Pasul!</p>
<p class="bas indent2"><span class="nm">12.</span><span class="cl">Answer:</span> There, she must leave. Here, she may stay married.</p>
<p class="bas indent2"><span class="nm">13.</span><span class="cl">Question:</span> Some hold that here, she must leave. How can they answer the question?</p>
<p class="bas indent2"><span class="nm">14.</span><span class="cl">Answer:</span> They establish our Mishnah like R. Meir. There, the children are Mamzerim. Here, they are not.</p>
<p class="bas indent1"><span class="nm">(d)</span><span class="cl">Question:</span> The Mishnah says twice that there are three such Gitin. What does this come to exclude?</p>
<p class="bas indent1"><span class="nm">(e)</span><span class="cl">Answer:</span> The first time, it excludes the Gitin listed above. The second time, it excludes the following case:</p>
<p class="bas indent2"><span class="nm">1.</span><span class="cl">(Beraisa - R. Meir):</span> If a Shali'ach brought a Get from Chutz La'aretz, and gave it without saying 'it was written and signed in front of me", if she remarried, she must be divorced. The children are Mamzerim;</p>
<p class="bas indent2"><span class="nm">2.</span>Chachamim say, the children are not Mamzerim;</p>
<p class="bas indent3"><span class="nm">i.</span>The Shali'ach should take the Get back and give it again, and make the declaration.</p>
<p class="bas subject"><span class="nm">3)</span>WHO WROTE THE <i>GET</i>?</p>
<p class="bas indent1"><span class="nm">(a)</span><span class="cl">(Mishnah):</span> The Get is in Kesav Yado, and witnesses did not sign.</p>
<p class="bas indent1"><span class="nm">(b)</span><span class="cl">(Rav):</span> The Mishnah discusses a Get in Kesav Yado.</p>
<p class="bas indent1"><span class="nm">(c)</span><span class="cl">Question:</span> To which of the three Gitin does Rav refer?</p>
<p class="bas indent2"><span class="nm">1.</span>He cannot teach about the first. The Mishnah explicitly says that it is in Kesav Yado!</p>
<p class="bas indent2"><span class="nm">2.</span><span class="cl">Suggestion:</span> He teaches about the second.</p>
<p class="bas indent2"><span class="nm">3.</span><span class="cl">Rejection:</span> Two witnesses signed it. Why would we require that the husband wrote it?</p>
<p class="bas indent1"><span class="nm">(d)</span><span class="cl">Answer:</span> He refers to the last Get. It has a date and one witness signed;</p>
<p class="bas bbbline">86b----------------------------------------86b</p>
<p class="bas indent2"><span class="nm">1.</span>We must say that the husband wrote it. Had a scribe written it, the children would be Mamzerim.</p>
<p class="bas indent1"><span class="nm">(e)</span><span class="cl">(Shmuel):</span> The Mishnah discusses even when a scribe wrote it;</p>
<p class="bas indent2"><span class="nm">1.</span><span class="cl">(Mishnah):</span> If a scribe wrote a Get and one witness signed, it is valid.</p>
<p class="bas indent1"><span class="nm">(f)</span><span class="cl">Question (Rav):</span> That Mishnah permits her to marry l'Chatchilah. Our Mishnah does not!</p>
<p class="bas indent1"><span class="nm">(g)</span><span class="cl">Answer (Shmuel):</span> That Mishnah discusses a scribe whose writing is known. In our Mishnah, the scribe's writing is not known.</p>
<p class="bas indent1"><span class="nm">(h)</span><span class="cl">(R. Yochanan):</span> The Mishnah discusses a Get in the husband's handwriting.</p>
<p class="bas indent1"><span class="nm">(i)</span><span class="cl">Question (R. Elazar):</span> Witnesses signed it! (Why do we require the husband's Kesav Yad?)</p>
<p class="bas indent1"><span class="nm">(j)</span><span class="cl">Answer (R. Yochanan):</span> I refer to the last Get.</p>
<p class="bas indent1"><span class="nm">(k)</span>Sometimes Rav would say that she must leave her new husband. Sometimes, he would say that she may stay;</p>
<p class="bas indent2"><span class="nm">1.</span>If she has children from him, she may stay. If not, she must leave.</p>
<p class="bas indent1"><span class="nm">(l)</span><span class="cl">Question (Mar Zutra bar Tuvya - Mishnah):</span> Any case in which a close relative of the Yavam was Safek or divorced to the deceased, the co-wife does Chalitzah, not Yibum.</p>
<p class="bas indent2"><span class="nm">1.</span>The case of Safek Kidushin is when he threw money to be Mekadesh her, and we do not know if it landed closer to him or her. This is the case of doubtful Kidushin.</p>
<p class="bas indent2"><span class="nm">2.</span>The case of Safek divorce is when he wrote a Get in his Kesav Yado and no witnesses signed; or, witnesses signed it, but there is no date on it; or, it has a date, but only one witness signed it. These are the cases of Safek divorce.</p>
<p class="bas indent2"><span class="nm">3.</span><span class="cl">(Summation of question):</span> If she may stay married, people will think that it is a valid Get, and the co-wife will do Yibum!</p>
<p class="bas indent1"><span class="nm">(m)</span><span class="cl">Answer:</span> That is no problem. Mid'Oraisa, the Get is valid, and she may do Yibum!</p>
<p class="bas indent2"><span class="nm">1.</span>The Get is Pasul mid'Rabanan (so l'Chatchilah, she should do Chalitzah).</p>
<p class="bas indent1"><span class="nm">(n)</span><span class="cl">(Levi, R. Yochanan, and R. Chalafta):</span> Even if she has no children, she need not leave her new husband.</p>
<p class="bas subject"><span class="nm">4)</span>A FLY THAT DRANK <i>MEI</i> <i>CHATAS</i></p>
<p class="bas indent1"><span class="nm">(a)</span><span class="cl">(R. Yochanan citing R. Chalafta):</span> If a Kratzis in a stack of produce drank Mei Chatas (water on which ashes of the red heifer were put), it does not disqualify the water.</p>
<p class="bas indent1"><span class="nm">(b)</span><span class="cl">Question:</span> What is a Kratzis?</p>
<p class="bas indent1"><span class="nm">(c)</span><span class="cl">Answer (Abaye):</span> It is a big fly similar to a locust, that resides in stacks.</p>
<p class="bas indent1"><span class="nm">(d)</span><span class="cl">Question (Rav Daniel bar Rav Ketina - Mishnah):</span> Any bird that drinks Mei Chatas disqualifies it, except for a dove, for it sucks the water (and does not spit it back out).</p>
<p class="bas indent2"><span class="nm">1.</span>It did not say that also a Kratzis does not disqualify it!</p>
<p class="bas indent1"><span class="nm">(e)</span><span class="cl">Answer:</span> This is because the law varies. A small Kratzis disqualifies, but a large one does not.</p>
<p class="bas indent1"><span class="nm">(f)</span><span class="cl">Question:</span> Until what size is considered small?</p>
<p class="bas indent1"><span class="nm">(g)</span><span class="cl">Answer:</span> It is until the size of an olive.</p>
<p class="bas subject"><span class="nm">5)</span>WHICH WITNESSES EMPOWER A <i>GET</i>?</p>
<p class="bas indent1"><span class="nm">(a)</span><span class="cl">(Mishnah - R. Elazar):</span> Even though witnesses did not sign...</p>
<p class="bas indent1"><span class="nm">(b)</span><span class="cl">(Rav):</span> The Halachah follows R. Elazar regarding Gitin.</p>
<p class="bas indent1"><span class="nm">(c)</span><span class="cl">(Shmuel):</span> The Halachah follows R. Elazar also regarding monetary documents.</p>
<p class="bas indent1"><span class="nm">(d)</span><span class="cl">Question:</span> Does Rav hold unlike R. Elazar regarding monetary documents?!</p>
<p class="bas indent2"><span class="nm">1.</span>The Mishnah says that with such a document, one may collect from Meshubadim!</p>
<p class="bas indent1"><span class="nm">(e)</span><span class="cl">Answer:</span> R. Elazar holds that also for monetary documents, Edei Mesirah (the witnesses who saw it given) Karsei (empower it). Rav holds like R. Elazar only regarding Gitei Nashim and freedom.</p>
<p class="bas indent1"><span class="nm">(f)</span><span class="cl">(R. Yakov bar Idi, R. Yosi bar Chanina... ):</span> The Halachah follows R. Elazar regarding Gitin.</p>
<p class="bas indent1"><span class="nm">(g)</span><span class="cl">(R. Yanai, R. Yochanan):</span> The Get does not even disqualify her from Kehunah.</p>
<p class="bas indent1"><span class="nm">(h)</span><span class="cl">Question:</span> Do they hold that the Halachah does not follow R. Elazar?!</p>
<p class="bas indent1"><span class="nm">(i)</span><span class="cl">Answer:</span> No. They meant that according to Chachamim, it does not even disqualify her from Kehunah.</p>
<p class="bas indent1"><span class="nm">(j)</span><span class="cl">(Mishnah):</span> If two men sent identical Gitin (all names are the same), and they got mixed up, each Shali'ach should give both Gitin to the wife he was sent to.</p>
<p class="bas indent2"><span class="nm">1.</span>Therefore, if one Get was lost, the other is void.</p>
<p class="bas indent1"><span class="nm">(k)</span>If five men wrote a joint Get, i.e. Reuven divorces Leah, Shimon divorces Rachel... and witnesses signed below, all are valid;</p>
<p class="bas indent2"><span class="nm">1.</span>The Get is given to each wife.</p>
<p class="bas indent1"><span class="nm">(l)</span>If a Tofes (the standard text of a Get without the names and date) was written for each couple, only the Get right before the signatures is valid.</p>
<p class="bas indent1"><span class="nm">(m)</span><span class="cl">(Gemara) Question:</span> Who is the Tana of our Mishnah?</p>
<p class="bas indent1"><span class="nm">(n)</span><span class="cl">Answer #1 (R. Yirmeyah):</span> It is not like R. Elazar;</p>
<p class="bas indent2"><span class="nm">1.</span>R. Elazar says that Edei Mesirah Karsei. (Witnesses need not sign. Rather, "v'Chosav... v'Nosan" must be Lishmah.) Here, the Edei Mesirah do not know which Get divorces each woman!</p>
<p class="bas indent1"><span class="nm">(o)</span><span class="cl">Answer #2 (Abaye):</span> The Mishnah can even be like R. Elazar. He requires only that the Get be written Lishmah, but it need not be given Lishmah.</p>
<p class="bas subject"><span class="nm">6)</span>A JOINT <i>GET</i></p>
<p class="bas indent1"><span class="nm">(a)</span><span class="cl">(Mishnah):</span> If five men wrote a joint Get...</p>
<p class="bas indent1"><span class="nm">(b)</span><span class="cl">Question:</span> What is considered joint Gitin, and what is considered (a) Tofes (for each)?</p>
<p class="bas indent1"><span class="nm">(c)</span><span class="cl">Answer #1 (R. Yochanan):</span> If there is one date for all of them, this is a joint Get. If there is a date for each, this is Tofes.</p>
