<div class="subject"><span class="nm">1)</span><p>ASHAM METZORA SHE'LO LISHMAH</p></div>
<div class="indent1"><span class="nm">(a)</span><p><span class="cl">Answer #2 (Rava):</span> The lambs of the Omer and Tamid are Olos. If they are not brought like Chovos (like their original laws), they are Nedavos;</p></div>
<div class="indent2"><span class="nm">1.</span><p>R. Yochanan specifically taught Asham Metzora. If it is not brought like Chovah (with Nesachim), it cannot be a Nedavah.</p></div>
<div class="indent1"><span class="nm">(b)</span><p><span class="cl">Support (for R. Yochanan - Beraisa):</span> If Asham Metzora was slaughtered Lo Lishmah, or if its blood was not put on the Behonos, it is offered on the Mizbe'ach, and it requires Nesachim. The Metzora must bring another Asham.</p></div>
<div class="subject"><span class="nm">2)</span><p>MIDOS GEDUSHOS AND MIDOS MECHUKOS</p></div>
<div class="indent1"><span class="nm">(a)</span><p><span class="cl">(Mishnah):</span> All the measures in the Mikdash were Gedushos (when they are overflowing, the measure is complete), except (those used for Chavitim) of the Kohen Gadol, which were Mechukos (they properly contain the full measure).</p></div>
<div class="indent1"><span class="nm">(b)</span><p>Birutzim (the excess above the brim; alternatively, the foam) of wet measures are Kodesh. Those of dry measures are Chulin;</p></div>
<div class="indent1"><span class="nm">(c)</span><p>R. Akiva says, wet measures are Kodesh, therefore their Birutzim are Kodesh. Dry measures are Chulin, therefore their Birutzim are Chulin;</p></div>
<div class="indent1"><span class="nm">(d)</span><p>R. Yosi says, this is not the reason. Rather, liquids are Ne'ekarim. (When a Kli is filled to overflowing, liquid that was inside is pushed outside. It already became Kodesh.) Solids are not Ne'ekarim.</p></div>
<div class="indent1"><span class="nm">(e)</span><p><span class="cl">(Gemara) Question:</span> (The Mishnah says that all the measures were Gedushos, except of the Kohen Gadol.) Who is the Tana?</p></div>
<div class="indent2"><span class="nm">1.</span><p>This is unlike R. Meir. He holds that there was only one Gadush measure (an Isaron, and two Mechukos for Chavitim, Isaron and half-Isaron);</p></div>
<div class="indent2"><span class="nm">2.</span><p>This is unlike Chachamim. They hold that there was only one measure (other than the Machuk half-Isaron for Chavitim), and (also) it was Machuk!</p></div>
<div class="indent1"><span class="nm">(f)</span><p><span class="cl">Answer (Rav Chisda):</span> It is like R. Meir. It means that all the measurings were Gedushos...</p></div>
<div class="subject"><span class="nm">3)</span><p>BIRUTZEI MIDOS</p></div>
<div class="indent1"><span class="nm">(a)</span><p><span class="cl">(Mishnah):</span> Birutzim of wet measures are Kodesh.</p></div>
<div class="indent1"><span class="nm">(b)</span><p><span class="cl">Question:</span> What do they argue about?</p></div>
<div class="indent1"><span class="nm">(c)</span><p><span class="cl">Answer:</span> The first Tana holds that wet measures were Mekudashos (with Shemen ha'Mishchah) on the inside and outside, and dry measures were Mekudashos only on the inside;</p></div>
<div class="indent2"><span class="nm">1.</span><p>R. Akiva holds that wet measures were Mekudashos on the inside and outside, and dry measures were not Mekudashos at all. (What is put inside gets only Kedushas Peh, i.e. the person says that it should be Kodesh. He is Mekadesh only what he needs, but not Birutzim);</p></div>
<div class="indent2"><span class="nm">2.</span><p>R. Yosi holds that both of them were Mekudashos only on the inside. Birutzim of wet measures are Kodesh because liquids are Ne'ekarim; they were once in the Kli.</p></div>
<div class="indent1"><span class="nm">(d)</span><p><span class="cl">Question:</span> One intends to be Mekadesh only what he needs. Being Ne'ekar does not make things Kodesh!</p></div>
<div class="indent1"><span class="nm">(e)</span><p><span class="cl">Answer #1 (Rav Dimi bar Shishna):</span> This teaches that Klei Shares are Mekadesh without one's intent.</p></div>
<div class="indent1"><span class="nm">(f)</span><p><span class="cl">Answer #2 (Ravina):</span> We can say that Klei Shares are not Mekadesh without intent.  Chachamim decreed that Birutzim of wet measures are Kodesh, lest people think that we may use (for Chulin) things that were in a Kli Shares.</p></div>
<div class="indent1"><span class="nm">(g)</span><p><span class="cl">Question (R. Zeira - Mishnah):</span> If Lechem ha'Panim was put on the Shulchan after Shabbos and the Bazichei Levonah were Huktar the following Shabbos, the bread is Pasul;</p></div>
<div class="indent2"><span class="nm">1.</span><p>Rather, the bread must be left on the Shulchan from Shabbos to Shabbos (in this case, 13 days after it was put there. Only then we are Maktir the Levonah.) It is no problem to leave the bread on the Shulchan for many days.</p></div>
<div class="indent2"><span class="nm">2.</span><p>According to Ravina, we should decree to disqualify it, lest people think that Linah does not apply to something in a Kli Shares, even if left longer than is proper!</p></div>
<div class="indent1"><span class="nm">(h)</span><p><span class="cl">Answer:</span> That does not disprove Ravina. Lechem ha'Panim is in the Heichal. Only Kohanim know how long it was there. (They are zealous, so we are not concerned lest they err.) Measures are used outside the Heichal. Everyone can see Birutzim being used for Chulin, so people will err.</p></div>
<div class="indent1"><span class="nm">(i)</span><p><span class="cl">(Mishnah):</span> Mosar (extra) Nesachim are used to buy Kitz ha'Mizbe'ach (Olos Tzibur to bring when the Mizbe'ach is idle).</p></div>
<div class="indent1"><span class="nm">(j)</span><p><span class="cl">Question:</span> What is Mosar Nesachim?</p></div>
<div class="indent1"><span class="nm">(k)</span><p><span class="cl">Answer #1 (R. Chiya bar Yosef):</span> It is Birutzei Midos.</p></div>
<div class="indent1"><span class="nm">(l)</span><p><span class="cl">Answer #2 (R. Yochanan):</span> It is Hekdesh's profit from changing prices (like the following):</p></div>
<div class="indent2"><span class="nm">1.</span><p><span class="cl">(Mishnah):</span> If Ploni agreed to supply Soles (to Hekdesh) at the price of four (Sa'im per Sela), and the price rose to three, he supplies at the rate of four;</p></div>
<div class="bbbline">90b----------------------------------------90b</p></div>
<div class="indent2"><span class="nm">2.</span><p>If he agreed to supply at the price of three, and the price declined to four, he supplies at the rate of four;</p></div>
<div class="indent2"><span class="nm">3.</span><p>This is because Hekdesh has the upper hand.</p></div>
<div class="indent1"><span class="nm">(m)</span><p>One Beraisa supports R. Chiya bar Yosef, and one supports R. Yochanan.</p></div>
<div class="indent1"><span class="nm">(n)</span><p><span class="cl">(Beraisa #1):</span> If there is a Korban in the Azarah (without Nesachim), Birutzei Midos may be used for it;</p></div>
<div class="indent2"><span class="nm">1.</span><p>If Lanu (our text, i.e. they were left overnight; the text in the Tosefta is 'Lav', i.e. if they were not used for it), they are Nifsalim due to Linah;</p></div>
<div class="indent2"><span class="nm">2.</span><p>If no Korban is around, they are (redeemed and) used for Kitz ha'Mizbe'ach, i.e. Olos. The meat is Huktar, the Kohanim receive the skin</p></div>
<div class="indent1"><span class="nm">(o)</span><p><span class="cl">(Beraisa #2):</span> If Ploni agreed to supply (to Hekdesh) at the price of four and the price rose to three, or vice-versa, he supplies at the rate of four. This is because Hekdesh has the upper hand;</p></div>
<div class="indent2"><span class="nm">1.</span><p>About this profit we learned 'Mosar Nesachim are used to buy Kitz ha'Mizbe'ach.'</p></div>
<div class="subject"><span class="nm">4)</span><p>WHICH KORBANOS REQUIRE NESACHIM?</p></div>
<div class="indent1"><span class="nm">(a)</span><p><span class="cl">(Mishnah):</span> All Korbanos, of the Tzibur or of individuals, require Nesachim, except for Bechor, Ma'aser, Pesach, and (most cases of) Chatas and Asham;</p></div>
<div class="indent2"><span class="nm">1.</span><p>The Chatas and Asham of a Metzora require Nesachim.</p></div>
<div class="indent1"><span class="nm">(b)</span><p><span class="cl">(Gemara - Beraisa) Suggestion:</span> Perhaps "va'Asisem Isheh la'Shem" teaches that everything Huktar requires Nesachim, even a Minchah!</p></div>
<div class="indent2"><span class="nm">1.</span><p><span class="cl">Rejection:</span> It says "Olah".</p></div>
<div class="indent2"><span class="nm">2.</span><p><span class="cl">Question:</span> What is the source that Shelamim requires Nesachim?</p></div>
<div class="indent2"><span class="nm">3.</span><p><span class="cl">Answer:</span> It says "Zevach".</p></div>
<div class="indent2"><span class="nm">4.</span><p><span class="cl">Question:</span> What is the source that Todah requires Nesachim?</p></div>
<div class="indent2"><span class="nm">5.</span><p><span class="cl">Answer:</span> "Oh Zevach" includes it.</p></div>
<div class="indent2"><span class="nm">6.</span><p><span class="cl">Suggestion:</span> Perhaps we include even Bechor, Ma'aser, Pesach, Chatas and Asham!</p></div>
<div class="indent2"><span class="nm">7.</span><p><span class="cl">Rejection:</span> "Lefalei Neder Oh vi'Ndavah" this teaches that only Korbanos that can be brought for Nedavah require Nesachim.</p></div>
<div class="indent2"><span class="nm">8.</span><p><span class="cl">Suggestion:</span> We should exclude obligatory Korbanos of the festivals, i.e. Olos Re'iyah and Shalmei Chagigah!</p></div>
<div class="indent2"><span class="nm">9.</span><p><span class="cl">Rejection:</span> "Oh b'Mo'adeichem" teaches that anything (that must be) brought on the festival requires Nesachim.</p></div>
<div class="indent2"><span class="nm">10.</span><p><span class="cl">Suggestion:</span> We should include the Chatas (goat) that is part of Musaf on each day of the festival. It is obligatory!</p></div>
<div class="indent2"><span class="nm">11.</span><p><span class="cl">Rejection - Question:</span> "V'Chi Sa'aseh Ven Bakar" - the Parshah already mentioned cattle and flock. Why does it mention cattle again?</p></div>
<div class="indent3"><span class="nm">i.</span><p><span class="cl">Answer:</span> The verse discusses a bull brought for Nedavah. It teaches that only (kinds of) Korbanos that can be brought for Nedavah require Nesachim (e.g. Olos and Shelamim, even Chovos of the festival, but not Chata'os)</p></div>
<div class="indent2"><span class="nm">12.</span><p><span class="cl">Question:</span> What do we learn from "La'asos Re'ach Nicho'ach la'Shem Min ha'Bakar Oh Min ha'Tzon"?</p></div>
<div class="indent2"><span class="nm">13.</span><p><span class="cl">Answer #1 (R. Yoshiyah) Suggestion:</span> Perhaps "Olah" includes even Olas ha'Of!</p></div>
<div class="indent3"><span class="nm">i.</span><p><span class="cl">Rejection:</span> "Min ha'Bakar Oh Min ha'Tzon" (teaches only animals, but not birds.)</p></div>
<div class="indent2"><span class="nm">14.</span><p><span class="cl">Objection (R. Yonason):</span> We do not need this to exclude birds. It says "Zevach". Korbanos ha'Of are not slaughtered!</p></div>
<div class="indent2"><span class="nm">15.</span><p><span class="cl">Question:</span> What does R. Yonason learn from "La'asos Re'ach... Min ha'Bakar Oh Min ha'Tzon"?</p></div>
<div class="indent2"><span class="nm">16.</span><p><span class="cl">Answer:</span> Since it says "Adam Ki Yakriv... Min ha'Behemah Min ha'Bakar u'Min ha'Tzon", one might have thought that one who vows to bring an Olah must bring a bull and Seh. "Min ha'Bakar Oh Min ha'Tzon" teaches that it suffices to bring one of them.</p></div>
<div class="indent2"><span class="nm">17.</span><p><span class="cl">Question:</span> According to R. Yonason, why must it say "Oh"? He holds that even (the prefix) 'Vov' connotes 'or', unless it explicitly says 'Yachdav' (together, like it says regarding Kilayim)!</p></div>
<div class="indent2"><span class="nm">18.</span><p><span class="cl">Answer:</span> Since it says "Adam... u'Min ha'Tzon" (and it could have omitted the 'Vov'), it is as if it says 'Yachdav'.</p></div>
