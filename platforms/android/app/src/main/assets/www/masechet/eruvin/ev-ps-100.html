<div class="subject"><span class="nm">1)</span><p>WITHIN THREE TEFACHIM OF THE GROUND IS PERMITTED</p></div>
<div class="indent1"><span class="nm">(a)</span><p><span class="cl">Answer:</span> It is a Dirah for the sake of Avir (what is outside itself, e.g. to guard produce). One may not carry more than Beis Se'atayim in such a Dirah.</p></div>
<div class="indent1"><span class="nm">(b)</span><p><span class="cl">(Mishnah):</span> If its Sharashim are three Tefachim tall...</p></div>
<div class="indent1"><span class="nm">(c)</span><p><span class="cl">(Rabah):</span> If Sharashim rise three Tefachim above the ground and afterwards bend down to within three, one may use them [on Shabbos where they are less than three].</p></div>
<div class="indent1"><span class="nm">(d)</span><p><span class="cl">(Rav Sheshes):</span> One may not use them.</p></div>
<div class="indent1"><span class="nm">(e)</span><p>Rabah permits, because anything within three of the ground is considered like the ground;</p></div>
<div class="indent1"><span class="nm">(f)</span><p>Rav Sheshes forbids, because they emanate from something forbidden.</p></div>
<div class="indent1"><span class="nm">(g)</span><p>If big Sharashim emanate from the tree and slope upwards, and small Sharashim emanate from them and slope down (see Perush Chai diagram, Perek 10 number 33, in the <a href=../chai/eruv-10chai033.jpg>English Charts</a> section) --</p></div>
<div class="indent2"><span class="nm">1.</span><p>All forbid Sharashim above [three Tefachim]. All permit Sharashim that emanate below [three];</p></div>
<div class="indent2"><span class="nm">2.</span><p>Rabah and Rav Sheshes argue about Sharashim that emanate above [three] and slope back down [to within three].</p></div>
<div class="indent1"><span class="nm">(h)</span><p>The same applies to a tree growing out of an irrigation channel, or in a corner. (The tree grows partially in the banks of the channel or in the walls. Two sides of the tree [in a channel, or three sides if it is in a corner], are covered. See Perush Chai diagram, Perek 10 number 35, in the <a href=../chai/eruv-10chai035.jpg>English Charts</a> section. Rabah permits the first three Tefachim above the channel or corner, like within three Tefachim of the ground. Rav Sheshes measures from the ground, and forbids.)</p></div>
<div class="indent1"><span class="nm">(i)</span><p>Abaye had a date tree growing in his house. It emerged from a skylight to the roof. Rav Yosef permitted [the first three Tefachim above the roof, for they appear to be less than three tall].</p></div>
<div class="indent1"><span class="nm">(j)</span><p><span class="cl">Rav Acha bar Tachlifa:</span> Rav Yosef permitted according to Rabah's opinion.</p></div>
<div class="indent1"><span class="nm">(k)</span><p><span class="cl">Objection:</span> This is obvious! (It emanates from something forbidden, i.e. the tree inside the house.)</p></div>
<div class="indent1"><span class="nm">(l)</span><p><span class="cl">Answer:</span> One might have thought that we consider the house to be full, so it is as if below the roof is totally covered, and even Rav Sheshes would permit three Tefachim above the roof. Rav Acha teaches that this is not so.</p></div>
<div class="indent1"><span class="nm">(m)</span><p><span class="cl">Question (against Rabah - Mishnah):</span> If the Sharashim are three Tefachim tall, one may not sit on them.</p></div>
<div class="indent2"><span class="nm">1.</span><p><span class="cl">Question:</span> What is the case?</p></div>
<div class="indent3"><span class="nm">i.</span><p>If [they are indeed three tall, i.e.] they do not bend back within three, this is obvious!</p></div>
<div class="indent2"><span class="nm">2.</span><p><span class="cl">Answer #1:</span> They bend back within three!</p></div>
<div class="indent1"><span class="nm">(n)</span><p><span class="cl">Answer (and Answer #2 to Question (1)):</span> Really, they do not bend back. The case is, one side [of the Sharashim] is even with the ground.</p></div>
<div class="subject"><span class="nm">2)</span><p>USING TREES ON SHABBOS</p></div>
<div class="indent1"><span class="nm">(a)</span><p><span class="cl">(Beraisa):</span> If Sharashim of a tree are three Tefachim above the ground, or if there is a gap of three Tefachim underneath them, even if one side is even with the ground, one may not sit on them;</p></div>
<div class="indent2"><span class="nm">1.</span><p>This is because one may not climb a tree, hang on it or lean on it.</p></div>
<div class="indent1"><span class="nm">(b)</span><p>One may not climb a tree before Shabbos and stay there for all of Shabbos;</p></div>
<div class="indent2"><span class="nm">1.</span><p>The same law of trees applies to all animals;</p></div>
<div class="indent2"><span class="nm">2.</span><p>However, one may climb up or down a pit or wall, even if it is 100 Amos. (We are not concerned for exertion. The only concern is lest one break off a branch.)</p></div>
<div class="indent1"><span class="nm">(c)</span><p><span class="cl">(Beraisa #1):</span> If one climbed up [a tree] he may climb down [on Shabbos].</p></div>
<div class="indent1"><span class="nm">(d)</span><p><span class="cl">Contradiction (Beraisa #2):</span> He may not climb down.</p></div>
<div class="indent1"><span class="nm">(e)</span><p><span class="cl">Resolution #1:</span> He may climb down only if he climbed up before Shabbos.</p></div>
<div class="indent1"><span class="nm">(f)</span><p><span class="cl">Resolution #2:</span> In both cases he climbed up on Shabbos. He may climb down only if he climbed up b'Shogeg.</p></div>
<div class="indent1"><span class="nm">(g)</span><p><span class="cl">Resolution #3:</span> In both cases he climbed up on Shabbos b'Shogeg. Beraisa #2 fines Shogeg due to Mezid, and Beraisa #1 does not fine.</p></div>
<div class="indent1"><span class="nm">(h)</span><p><span class="cl">Resolution #4 (Rav Huna brei d'Rav Yehoshua):</span> Tana'im argue about this:</p></div>
<div class="indent2"><span class="nm">1.</span><p><span class="cl">(Mishnah):</span> If blood [of a Korban] that requires one Matanah (it must be thrown on one side of the Mizbe'ach) was mixed with blood that requires one Matanah; we do one Matanah;</p></div>
<div class="indent2"><span class="nm">2.</span><p>If blood that requires four Matanos (it is thrown on opposite corners, blood splashes on all four sides) was mixed with blood that requires four, four are done;</p></div>
<div class="indent2"><span class="nm">3.</span><p>If blood that requires one Matanah was mixed with blood that requires four --</p></div>
<div class="indent3"><span class="nm">i.</span><p>R. Eliezer says, we do four Matanos;</p></div>
<div class="indent3"><span class="nm">ii.</span><p>R. Yehoshua says, we do one.</p></div>
<div class="indent3"><span class="nm">iii.</span><p><span class="cl">R. Eliezer:</span> You transgress Bal Tigra (detracting from a Mitzvah)!</p></div>
<div class="indent3"><span class="nm">iv.</span><p><span class="cl">R. Yehoshua:</span> You transgress Bal Tosif (adding to a Mitzvah)!</p></div>
<div class="indent3"><span class="nm">v.</span><p><span class="cl">R. Eliezer:</span> No, Bal Tosif is only when all the blood is being more than it should. Here, some of the blood requires all four Matanos!</p></div>
<div class="indent3"><span class="nm">vi.</span><p><span class="cl">R. Yehoshua:</span> Likewise, Bal Tigra is only when all the blood is thrown less than it should be. Here, he threw some of it as much as he should!</p></div>
<div class="indent3"><span class="nm">vii.</span><p>Further, if one throws too much, he transgresses Bal Tosif through an action. This is worse than throwing too little, for then he transgresses Bal Tigra passively!</p></div>
<div class="indent2"><span class="nm">4.</span><p><span class="cl">Conclusion:</span> R. Eliezer holds that [if one must transgress in any case] it is better to do an action. Here also, he would say that it is better to climb down (than to remain on the tree, which is passively transgressing);</p></div>
<div class="indent3"><span class="nm">i.</span><p>R. Yehoshua holds that it is better to be passive. He would say that it is better to remain on the tree.</p></div>
<div class="indent1"><span class="nm">(i)</span><p><span class="cl">Rejection #1:</span> R. Eliezer said that it is better to do an action only when he does a Mitzvah. (The Aseh, e.g. Zerikah, overrides the Lav of Bal Tosif.) Here, it is no Mitzvah to climb down!</p></div>
<div class="indent1"><span class="nm">(j)</span><p><span class="cl">Rejection #2:</span> R. Yehoshua only said that inaction is better when this is not an Aveirah. Here, remaining on the tree is an Aveirah!</p></div>
<div class="bbbline">100b----------------------------------------100b</p></div>
<div class="indent1"><span class="nm">(k)</span><p><span class="cl">(Beraisa #1):</span> The same [Isur] applies to a moist or dry (dead) tree.</p></div>
<div class="indent1"><span class="nm">(l)</span><p><span class="cl">Contradiction (Beraisa #2):</span> A moist tree is forbidden, but a dry tree is permitted.</p></div>
<div class="indent1"><span class="nm">(m)</span><p><span class="cl">Resolution #1 (Rav Yehudah):</span> A dry tree is forbidden if it can grow again. If not, it is permitted.</p></div>
<div class="indent1"><span class="nm">(n)</span><p><span class="cl">Objection:</span> If it can grow again, the Tana would not call it 'dry'!</p></div>
<div class="indent1"><span class="nm">(o)</span><p><span class="cl">Resolution #2:</span> Rather, it is forbidden in winter [due to suspicion, because people cannot tell that it is dead], and it is permitted in summer. (People know that it is dead because it has no leaves.)</p></div>
<div class="indent1"><span class="nm">(p)</span><p><span class="cl">Question:</span> If we permit using a dry tree, fruits will fall off, and people will come to detach from living trees!</p></div>
<div class="indent1"><span class="nm">(q)</span><p><span class="cl">Answer:</span> The case is, it has no fruits.</p></div>
<div class="indent1"><span class="nm">(r)</span><p><span class="cl">Question:</span> Twigs will break off, and people will come to detach from living trees!</p></div>
<div class="indent1"><span class="nm">(s)</span><p><span class="cl">Answer:</span> The case is, it is a barren stump without branches.</p></div>
<div class="indent2"><span class="nm">1.</span><p><span class="cl">Question:</span> Rav visited Apastiya and forbade such a tree!</p></div>
<div class="indent2"><span class="nm">2.</span><p><span class="cl">Answer:</span> Rav saw a need to be stringent [because the people there are unlearned].</p></div>
<div class="subject"><span class="nm">3)</span><p>WALKING ON GRASS ON SHABBOS</p></div>
<div class="indent1"><span class="nm">(a)</span><p><span class="cl">(Rami bar Aba):</span> One may not walk on grass on Shabbos - "v'Atz (one who tramples) b'Raglayim Chotei."</p></div>
<div class="indent1"><span class="nm">(b)</span><p><span class="cl">(Beraisa #1):</span> One may walk on grass on Shabbos.</p></div>
<div class="indent1"><span class="nm">(c)</span><p><span class="cl">Contradiction (Beraisa #2):</span> One may not walk on grass on Shabbos.</p></div>
<div class="indent1"><span class="nm">(d)</span><p><span class="cl">Resolution #1:</span> One may walk on dry grass on Shabbos (it is already considered detached), but not on wet grass.</p></div>
<div class="indent1"><span class="nm">(e)</span><p><span class="cl">Resolution #2:</span> Both Beraisos discuss wet grass. It is permitted in winter, but not in summer. (Tosfos R. Peretz - In summer it is not so soft, so grass will be uprooted; Rashi - it has seeds that will be dislodged. Tosfos ha'Rosh - it is forbidden in <i>winter</i>, for then it is hard. It is permitted in summer).</p></div>
<div class="indent1"><span class="nm">(f)</span><p><span class="cl">Resolution #3:</span> Both Beraisos discuss summer (some texts - winter). It is permitted if he wears shoes, and forbidden in bare feet. (Grass sticks between his toes and is uprooted.)</p></div>
<div class="indent1"><span class="nm">(g)</span><p><span class="cl">Resolution #4:</span> Both Beraisos discuss one who wears shoes. It is forbidden in shoes with spikes, and permitted in shoes without spikes.</p></div>
<div class="indent1"><span class="nm">(h)</span><p><span class="cl">Resolution #5:</span> Both Beraisos discuss shoes with spikes. It is permitted on short grass, and forbidden on long grass.</p></div>
<div class="indent1"><span class="nm">(i)</span><p>Nowadays, the Halachah follows R. Shimon [who permits Davar she'Eino Miskaven, i.e. something he does not intend for], so it is permitted in every case.</p></div>
<div class="subject"><span class="nm">4)</span><p>PROPER CONDUCT REGARDING RELATIONS</p></div>
<div class="indent1"><span class="nm">(a)</span><p><span class="cl">(Rami bar Chama):</span> One may not force his wife to have relations - "v'Atz b'Raglayim Chotei."</p></div>
<div class="indent1"><span class="nm">(b)</span><p><span class="cl">(R. Yehoshua ben Levi):</span> If one forces his wife to have relations, the children will be improper.</p></div>
<div class="indent1"><span class="nm">(c)</span><p><span class="cl">(Rav Ika bar Chanina):</span> He learns from "Gam b'Lo Da'as Nefesh Lo Tov."</p></div>
<div class="indent1"><span class="nm">(d)</span><p><span class="cl">Support (Beraisa):</span> "Gam b'Lo Da'as Nefesh Lo Tov" refers to one who forces his wife to have relations. "V'Atz b'Raglayim Chotei" is one who has relations and repeats the act.</p></div>
<div class="indent1"><span class="nm">(e)</span><p><span class="cl">Question:</span> Rava taught that if one wants all his children to be male, he should have relations and repeat the act!</p></div>
<div class="indent1"><span class="nm">(f)</span><p><span class="cl">Answer:</span> That is with his wife's consent. The Beraisa forbids without her consent.</p></div>
<div class="indent1"><span class="nm">(g)</span><p><span class="cl">(R. Shmuel bar Nachmani):</span> If a woman asks her husband to have relations, she will have children superior to the generation of Moshe!</p></div>
<div class="indent2"><span class="nm">1.</span><p>Moshe sought "Chachamim u'Nevonim vi'Du'im l'Shivteichem" [to be judges]. He took "Chachamim vi'Du'im", for he could not find Nevonim (people with Binah, i.e. to understand matters through other matters);</p></div>
<div class="indent2"><span class="nm">2.</span><p>Leah requested to have relations - "Elai Tavo Ki Sachor Secharticha." She became pregnant with Yisachar, from whom descended "Yod'ei Vinah la'Itim."</p></div>
<div class="indent1"><span class="nm">(h)</span><p><span class="cl">Question:</span> R. Yitzchak bar Avodimi taught that Chavah received 10 curses:</p></div>
<div class="indent2"><span class="nm">1.</span><p>"Harbah Arbeh" alludes to menstrual and virginal blood;</p></div>
<div class="indent2"><span class="nm">2.</span><p>"Itzvonech" is the pain of raising children;</p></div>
<div class="indent2"><span class="nm">3.</span><p>"V'Heronech" is the pain of pregnancy;</p></div>
<div class="indent2"><span class="nm">4.</span><p>"B'Etzev Teldi Vanim" is understood simply (the pain of birth);</p></div>
<div class="indent2"><span class="nm">5.</span><p>"V'El Ishech Teshukasech" teaches that a woman longs for her husband when he goes away;</p></div>
<div class="indent2"><span class="nm">6.</span><p>"V'Hu Yimshal Bach" - a woman desires relations [in her heart] but is too shy to verbalize it, but a man verbalizes it;</p></div>
<div class="indent3"><span class="nm">i.</span><p>This is a good trait in women.</p></div>
<div class="indent1"><span class="nm">(i)</span><p><span class="cl">Answer:</span> She may show affection [but does not say that she desires relations].</p></div>
<div class="indent1"><span class="nm">(j)</span><p><span class="cl">Question:</span> There are only seven curses!</p></div>
<div class="indent1"><span class="nm">(k)</span><p><span class="cl">Answer (Rav Dimi):</span> [Additionally,] her head is covered like a mourner (a married woman is ashamed to go outside with her head uncovered), she is excommunicated from all men (this will be explained), and she is incarcerated. (It is proper for her to stay inside.)</p></div>
<div class="indent1"><span class="nm">(l)</span><p><span class="cl">Question:</span> What is the meaning of 'she is excommunicated from all men'?</p></div>
<div class="indent2"><span class="nm">1.</span><p><span class="cl">Suggestion:</span> She may not be secluded with a man [other than her husband].</p></div>
<div class="indent2"><span class="nm">2.</span><p><span class="cl">Rejection:</span> Also a man may not be secluded with women!</p></div>
<div class="indent1"><span class="nm">(m)</span><p><span class="cl">Answer:</span> She may not be married to two men. (She is forbidden to all men other than her husband, whereas a man can have two wives.)</p></div>
<div class="indent1"><span class="nm">(n)</span><p><span class="cl">(Beraisa):</span> She grows hair like a Shed. She sits while urinating, like a mule. She is a pillow to her husband [she is underneath during relations];</p></div>
<div class="indent2"><span class="nm">1.</span><p>R. Yitzchak bar Avodimi omitted these because he holds that these are praiseworthy. (It is a modest way to urinate, and it is easier to be on bottom. Maharsha - we already counted excessive growth of hair. This is why she covers her head.)</p></div>
<div class="indent2"><span class="nm">2.</span><p><span class="cl">(R. Chiya) Question:</span> What do we learn from "Malfenu mi'Bahamos..."?</p></div>
<div class="indent2"><span class="nm">3.</span><p><span class="cl">Answer:</span> (Hash-m put instincts in animals from which we can learn.) He teaches us [modesty] from a mule. It sits while urinating;</p></div>
<div class="indent2"><span class="nm">4.</span><p>"Ume'Of ha'Shamayim Yechakmenu" refers to a rooster. It appeases a hen before relations. (This will be explained.)</p></div>
<div class="indent1"><span class="nm">(o)</span><p><span class="cl">(R. Yochanan):</span> Had the Torah not been given [to man], we would have had to learn Tzeni'us (modesty) from cats (R. Chananel - they have relations in covert places; Rashi - they eliminates in covert places and cover theirs excrement), [distancing from] theft from ants (they do not enter others' holes to steal. Also, if an ant carried a piece of wheat, other ants can smell this, and they will not take it), [distancing from] Arayos from doves (they have relations only with their mates), and how to have relations from roosters, which appease beforehand.</p></div>
<div class="indent1"><span class="nm">(p)</span><p><span class="cl">Question:</span> How does a rooster appease a hen?</p></div>
<div class="indent1"><span class="nm">(q)</span><p><span class="cl">Answer (Rav Yehudah):</span> [It spreads its wings, as if] it says 'I will buy a dress that reaches your feet';</p></div>
<div class="indent2"><span class="nm">1.</span><p>After relations, [it bends down its head, as if] it says 'my crest should be removed if I have the money and don't buy it for you.'</p></div>
