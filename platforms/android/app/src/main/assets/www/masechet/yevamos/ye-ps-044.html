<p class="dedicationbox">YEVAMOS 44 (24 Cheshvan) - dedicated by Dr. Moshe and Rivkie Snow in memory of Rivkie's father, the Manostrishtcher Rebbi, Hagaon Rav Yitzchak Yoel ben Harav Gedaliah Aharon Rabinowitz Ztz"l, Rav of Kehilas Nachalas Yehoshua in Canarsie, NY. A personification of the Torah scholar of old, the Ukranian-born Rebbi lived most of his life in the United States where his warm ways changed many lives. </p>

<p class="bas subject"><span class="nm">1)</span>ONE MAY DO <i>YIBUM</i> WITH MANY WOMEN (cont.)</p>
<p class="bas indent1"><span class="nm">(a)</span><span class="cl">(Continuation of Mishnah):</span> If one Yevamah was Kesherah (to Kehunah), and the other was Pesulah, if he does Chalitzah, he does it with the Pesulah. If he does Yibum, he does so with the Kesherah [if he wants].</p>
<p class="bas indent1"><span class="nm">(b)</span><span class="cl">(Gemara) Question:</span> Can it be that there were only four brothers? (If so, who survived to do Yibum?!)</p>
<p class="bas indent1"><span class="nm">(c)</span><span class="cl">Correction:</span> The Mishnah means, four of the brothers...</p>
<p class="bas indent1"><span class="nm">(d)</span><span class="cl">(Mishnah):</span> He may do Yibum to all four if he wants...</p>
<p class="bas indent1"><span class="nm">(e)</span><span class="cl">Question:</span> We would discourage him (because he will not be able to support them)!</p>
<p class="bas indent2"><span class="nm">1.</span><span class="cl">(Beraisa):</span> "The elders of his city call to him" - themselves, and not their messengers. "And they speak to him" - they give him proper counsel;</p>
<p class="bas indent3"><span class="nm">i.</span>If the Yavam is young and the Yevamah is old or vice-versa, they discourage Yibum - 'marry someone your own age, and do not invite quarrels into your home'.</p>
<p class="bas indent1"><span class="nm">(f)</span><span class="cl">Answer:</span> If he can support four wives, we allow him to do Yibum to all four.</p>
<p class="bas indent1"><span class="nm">(g)</span><span class="cl">Question:</span> If he is able, he can do Yibum with even more!</p>
<p class="bas indent1"><span class="nm">(h)</span><span class="cl">Answer:</span> Proper counsel is not to exceed four, so each will have Bi'ah with him (one Shabbos) every month.</p>
<p class="bas subject"><span class="nm">2)</span>ONLY ONE WOMAN DOES <i>YIBUM</i> OR <i>CHALITZAH</i></p>
<p class="bas indent1"><span class="nm">(a)</span><span class="cl">(Mishnah):</span> If a man was married to two women...</p>
<p class="bas indent1"><span class="nm">(b)</span><span class="cl">Question:</span> Why can't the Yavam do Yibum to both?</p>
<p class="bas indent1"><span class="nm">(c)</span><span class="cl">Answer (R. Chiya bar Aba):</span> "Who will not build the house of his brother" - he builds one house, but not two.</p>
<p class="bas indent1"><span class="nm">(d)</span><span class="cl">Suggestion:</span> Let him do Chalitzah to both!</p>
<p class="bas indent1"><span class="nm">(e)</span><span class="cl">Rejection (Mar Zutra bar Tuvya):</span> "The house of the one whose shoe was removed" - he does Chalitzah to one house, but not two.</p>
<p class="bas indent1"><span class="nm">(f)</span><span class="cl">Suggestion:</span> Let him do Yibum to one, and Chalitzah to the other!</p>
<p class="bas indent1"><span class="nm">(g)</span><span class="cl">Answer #1:</span> "If he does not want" Chalitzah is only for one who could do Yibum if he wanted.</p>
<p class="bas indent1"><span class="nm">(h)</span><span class="cl">Answer #2:</span> We do not want people to say that a house is partially built and partially Chalutz.</p>
<p class="bas indent2"><span class="nm">1.</span><span class="cl">Question:</span> What is wrong if they say that?</p>
<p class="bas indent2"><span class="nm">2.</span><span class="cl">Answer:</span> If they would do Yibum first, there would be no problem. We are concerned lest they do Chalitzah and then Yibum, transgressing "(Since he did not build), he may not build".</p>
<p class="bas indent1"><span class="nm">(i)</span><span class="cl">Suggestion:</span> We should say (learn from the singular "house") that there is a Mitzvah of Yibum when there is one Yevamah, but not when there are two Yevamos!</p>
<p class="bas indent2"><span class="nm">1.</span><span class="cl">Question:</span> If so, why did the Torah need to forbid Tzaras Ervah?</p>
<p class="bas indent3"><span class="nm">i.</span>If Yibum and Chalitzah never apply to two Yevamos, all Tzaros are exempt!</p>
<p class="bas indent2"><span class="nm">2.</span><span class="cl">Answer:</span> It needs to teach about Tzaras Ervah. One might have thought that it is as if the Ervah did not fall to Yibum, so the Tzarah may do Yibum!</p>
<p class="bas indent1"><span class="nm">(j)</span><span class="cl">Answer:</span> The verse says "Yevimto" twice, teaching that Yibum applies even when there are two Yevamos.</p>
<p class="bas indent1"><span class="nm">(k)</span><span class="cl">(Mishnah):</span> If one Yevamah... (he does Chalitzah with the Pesulah).</p>
<p class="bas indent1"><span class="nm">(l)</span><span class="cl">(Rav Yosef):</span> In this Mishnah, Rebbi taught that one should not spill his well water if others need it (Chalitzah to the Kesherah would disqualify her to a Kohen).</p>
<p class="bas subject"><span class="nm">3)</span>RELATIVES OF THE <i>CHALUTZAH</i></p>
<p class="bas indent1"><span class="nm">(a)</span><span class="cl">(Mishnah - R. Akiva):</span> If one was Machazir Gerushaso (remarried his ex-wife after she married someone else), or married his Chalutzah or Krovas Chalutzaso (one of her close relatives), he must divorce her. The child is a Mamzer;</p>
<p class="bas indent1"><span class="nm">(b)</span>Chachamim say that the child is not a Mamzer. They agree that if he married the relative of his ex-wife that the child is a Mamzer.</p>
<p class="bas indent1"><span class="nm">(c)</span><span class="cl">(Gemara) Question:</span> Does R. Akiva really hold that a Mamzer results from marrying Krovas Chalutzaso?</p>
<p class="bas indent2"><span class="nm">1.</span><span class="cl">(Reish Lakish):</span> Rebbi taught (in the Mishnah 41a) that the sister of Chalutzaso is forbidden only mid'Rabanan!</p>
<p class="bas indent1"><span class="nm">(d)</span><span class="cl">Correction:</span> The Mishnah should say that Krovas Gerushaso.</p>
<p class="bas indent1"><span class="nm">(e)</span><span class="cl">Support (Seifa):</span> Chachamim agree that Krovas Gerushaso produces a Mamzer.</p>
<p class="bas indent2"><span class="nm">1.</span>It is reasonable to say that Chachamim <i>admit</i> only if R. Akiva discussed this case.</p>
<p class="bas indent1"><span class="nm">(f)</span><span class="cl">Question:</span> Perhaps Chachamim come to teach that Mamzerim result from Chayavei Kerisus!</p>
<p class="bas indent1"><span class="nm">(g)</span><span class="cl">Answer:</span> Another Mishnah (49a) already teaches this:</p>
<p class="bas indent2"><span class="nm">1.</span><span class="cl">(Mishnah - R. Akiva):</span> All Chayavei Lavin produce Mamzerim;</p>
<p class="bas indent2"><span class="nm">2.</span>R. Shimon ha'Temani says, Chayavei Kerisus produce Mamzerim. This is the Halachah.</p>
<p class="bas indent1"><span class="nm">(h)</span><span class="cl">Question:</span> Perhaps our Mishnah gives R. Shimon ha'Temani's opinion Stam (anonymously, to show that this is the law)!</p>
<p class="bas indent1"><span class="nm">(i)</span><span class="cl">Rejection:</span> If so, it should teach other Chayavei Kerisus. Surely, it taught Krovas Gerushaso because R. Akiva discussed this case.</p>
<p class="bas indent1"><span class="nm">(j)</span><span class="cl">Objection:</span> We need not say that R. Akiva discussed it! Rather, since he discussed Machazir Gerushaso, Chalutzaso and Krovas Chalutzaso, Chachamim teach about the Krovas Gerushaso!</p>
<p class="bas indent2"><span class="nm">1.</span>(We need not change the text of the Mishnah.) R. Akiva holds that Krovas Chalutzaso produces Mamzerim.</p>
<p class="bas indent2"><span class="nm">2.</span><span class="cl">(R. Chiya bar Aba):</span> He learns from "Beis Chalutz ha'Na'al" - the Torah calls Chalutzaso 'Beiso' (as if she was his wife).</p>
<p class="bas subject"><span class="nm">4)</span>CHILDREN BLEMISHED TO <i>KEHUNAH</i></p>
<p class="bas indent1"><span class="nm">(a)</span><span class="cl">(Rav Yosef):</span> All agree that the child of Machazir Gerushaso is Pagum to (disqualified from) Kehunah.</p>
<p class="bas bbbline">44b----------------------------------------44b</p>
<p class="bas indent1"><span class="nm">(b)</span><span class="cl">Question:</span> Who agrees?</p>
<p class="bas indent1"><span class="nm">(c)</span><span class="cl">Answer:</span> Shimon ha'Temani agrees;</p>
<p class="bas indent2"><span class="nm">1.</span>Even though R. Shimon ha'Temani says that Chayavei Lavin do not produce Mamzerim, a Kal va'Chomer teaches that the child is Pagum.</p>
<p class="bas indent2"><span class="nm">2.</span>The Isur of a widow to a Kohen Gadol is not Shavah b'Chol, yet the child is Pagum. The Isur of Machazir Gerushaso applies to everyone, all the more so the child is Pagum!</p>
<p class="bas indent1"><span class="nm">(d)</span><span class="cl">Objection #1:</span> One cannot learn from a widow to a Kohen Gadol, since she herself becomes a Chalalah!</p>
<p class="bas indent1"><span class="nm">(e)</span><span class="cl">Objection #2:</span> It says about Machazir Gerushaso "<i>She</i> is an abomination", i.e. but her children are not!</p>
<p class="bas indent1"><span class="nm">(f)</span><span class="cl">Objection #3 (Beraisa - R. Akiva):</span> If one was Machazir Gerushaso, married Chalutzaso or Krovas Chalutzaso, Ein Kidushin Tofsin (Kidushin does not take effect) and she does not need a Get. She is Pesulah and her child is Pasul, and we force him to expel her;</p>
<p class="bas indent2"><span class="nm">1.</span>Chachamim say, Kidushin takes effect, she needs a Get, she is Kesherah and her child is Kosher.</p>
<p class="bas indent2"><span class="nm">2.</span><span class="cl">Suggestion:</span> 'Her child is Kosher', i.e. to Kehunah!</p>
<p class="bas indent1"><span class="nm">(g)</span><span class="cl">Answer (to Objection #3):</span> No, he is Kosher to Kahal (to marry Yisraelim).</p>
<p class="bas indent1"><span class="nm">(h)</span><span class="cl">Question:</span> You cannot say that 'She is Kesherah' means to Kahal! Obviously, Bi'as Isur does not disqualify her to Kahal!</p>
<p class="bas indent2"><span class="nm">1.</span>Rather, we must say that she is Kesherah to Kehunah, and also her child is Kosher to Kehunah.</p>
<p class="bas indent1"><span class="nm">(i)</span><span class="cl">Answer:</span> We need not say so! The Beraisa teaches her status regarding Kehunah, and her child's status regarding Kahal!</p>
<p class="bas indent1"><span class="nm">(j)</span><span class="cl">Support (Beraisa - R. Akiva):</span> She is Pesulah and her son is Pasul.</p>
<p class="bas indent2"><span class="nm">1.</span>We cannot say that she is Pesulah to Kahal. Bi'as Isur does not disqualify her from the congregation! Rather, it must be, to Kehunah.</p>
<p class="bas indent2"><span class="nm">2.</span>We cannot say that her child is Pasul to Kehunah, but he is Kosher to Kahal, for R. Akiva says that the child is a Mamzer! Rather, he is disqualified to Kahal.</p>
<p class="bas indent2"><span class="nm">3.</span><span class="cl">Conclusion:</span> The Reisha discuss disqualification to different groups, and the same applies to the Seifa.</p>
<p class="bas indent1"><span class="nm">(k)</span><span class="cl">Answer (to Objection #2):</span> "<i>She</i> is an abomination" teaches that her Tzarah is not an abomination. Her children are abominations.</p>
<p class="bas indent2"><span class="nm">1.</span>We have yet to answer Objection #1 - we cannot learn from a widow married to a Kohen Gadol, since she herself is defiled.</p>
<p class="bas indent1"><span class="nm">(l)</span><span class="cl">Retraction:</span> Rather, Rav Yosef learned as follows: All agree that the child of Chayavei Kerisus is Pagum.</p>
<p class="bas indent1"><span class="nm">(m)</span><span class="cl">Question:</span> Who agrees?</p>
<p class="bas indent1"><span class="nm">(n)</span><span class="cl">Answer:</span> R. Yehoshua agrees. Even though he says that Mamzerim do not come from Chayavei Kerisos, he agrees that the child is Pagum;</p>
<p class="bas indent2"><span class="nm">1.</span>He learns from a Kal va'Chomer from a widow to a Kohen Gadol. Even though this Isur is not Shavah b'Chol, the child is Pagum. Chayavei Kerisos are Shavah b'Chol, all the more so the child is Pagum!</p>
<p class="bas indent2"><span class="nm">2.</span><span class="cl">Question:</span> We cannot learn from a widow, for she herself becomes defiled.</p>
<p class="bas indent2"><span class="nm">3.</span><span class="cl">Answer:</span> Here also, she becomes a Zonah (and is forbidden to Kehunah).</p>
