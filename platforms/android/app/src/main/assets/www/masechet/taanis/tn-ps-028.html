<p class="bas subject"><span class="nm">1)</span>THE TORAH PORTIONS READ DURING THE <i>MA'AMAD  </i>(cont.)</p>
<p class="bas indent1"><span class="nm">(a)</span>The Mishnah said that the larger sections would be read by two people, the smaller by one,</p>
<p class="bas indent1"><span class="nm">(b)</span>...at Shacharis, at Musaf and at Minchah, everyone would recite it for themselves.</p>
<p class="bas indent2"><span class="nm">1.</span><span class="cl">Question:</span> Does this mean that the reading would be done at Shacharis and Musaf, and at Minchah everyone would recite it themselves, or does it mean that it would be done at Shacharis, and at Musaf and Minchah everyone would recite it themselves?</p>
<p class="bas indent2"><span class="nm">2.</span><span class="cl">Answer:</span> A Beraisa states the latter.</p>
<p class="bas indent1"><span class="nm">(c)</span><span class="cl">(R. Yosi):</span> An individual may not recite Torah by heart in public; rather, everyone would recite it together.</p>
<p class="bas indent1"><span class="nm">(d)</span>The Mishnah said that on any day where there was a Korban Eitzim, there was no Ma'amad for Ne'ilah.</p>
<p class="bas indent2"><span class="nm">1.</span><span class="cl">Question:</span> Why did it push aside the Ma'amad of Ne'ilah, but not that of Minchah?</p>
<p class="bas indent2"><span class="nm">2.</span><span class="cl">Answer:</span> Minchah is d'Oraisa, Ne'ilah is d'Rabanan.</p>
<p class="bas subject"><span class="nm">2)</span>THE DAYS OF THE WOOD-DONORS</p>
<p class="bas indent1"><span class="nm">(a)</span>The Mishnah said that there were seven occasions when people would donate wood for the pyres and bring Korbanos.</p>
<p class="bas indent1"><span class="nm">(b)</span><span class="cl">(Beraisa):</span> These people donated wood when the returnees from Bavel did not find wood in the Lishkah.</p>
<p class="bas indent1"><span class="nm">(c)</span>The Nevi'im decreed that even when the Lishkah would have wood, these people should still be privileged to donate it.</p>
<p class="bas indent1"><span class="nm">(d)</span>Two of the groups mentioned are the pestle-smugglers and the fig-harvesters:</p>
<p class="bas indent2"><span class="nm">1.</span>A decree was once passed that the Jews could not bring wood for the pyre or Bikkurim to Jerusalem, and guards were placed on the routes (like those of Yeravam).</p>
<p class="bas indent2"><span class="nm">2.</span>Certain righteous people outwitted the guards by placing the Bikkurim in baskets and covering them with figs, claiming that they were to be processed with their pestle and mortars.</p>
<p class="bas indent1"><span class="nm">(e)</span>It is taught that the ladder-people acted similarly.</p>
<p class="bas indent2"><span class="nm">1.</span>A decree was once passed that the Jews could not bring wood for the pyre and guards were stationed.</p>
<p class="bas indent2"><span class="nm">2.</span>The God-fearing men made the wood into ladders and told the guards that they were going to take birds from the dovecotes.</p>
<p class="bas indent1"><span class="nm">(f)</span>Regarding such people, the Pasuk says that "the Tzadik is remembered for blessing."</p>
<p class="bas indent1"><span class="nm">(g)</span>Regarding Yeravam ben Nevat and company, the Pasuk states that "the name of the wicked shall rot."</p>
<p class="bas indent1"><span class="nm">(h)</span>The Mishnah listed the Bnei Pachas Moav ben Yehudah as another group.</p>
<p class="bas indent2"><span class="nm">1.</span><span class="cl">(R. Meir):</span> These are the descendants of King David (Pachas Moav=Ruth).</p>
<p class="bas indent2"><span class="nm">2.</span><span class="cl">(R. Yosi):</span> They are the descendants of Yoav (a descendant of Ruth).</p>
<p class="bas indent1"><span class="nm">(i)</span>The Mishnah listed the Bnei Adin ben Yehudah as another group.</p>
<p class="bas indent2"><span class="nm">1.</span><span class="cl">(R. Yehudah):</span> These are the descendants of King David (Adin, soft and humble).</p>
<p class="bas indent2"><span class="nm">2.</span><span class="cl">(R. Yosi):</span> They are the descendants of Yoav.</p>
<p class="bas indent1"><span class="nm">(j)</span><span class="cl">Question:</span> Who is the Mishnah, which singles out the Bnei Parosh as having an additional wood-donating day, following?</p>
<p class="bas indent2"><span class="nm">1.</span>It cannot be R. Meir, as he would hold that the Bnei David (i.e. the Bnei Pachas Moav) also had another day.</p>
<p class="bas indent2"><span class="nm">2.</span>It cannot be R. Yehudah, as he would hold that the Bnei David (i.e. the Bnei Adin) also had another day.</p>
<p class="bas indent2"><span class="nm">3.</span>It cannot be R. Yosi, as he would hold that the Bnei Yoav (Bnei Pachas and Bnei Adin) also had two days.</p>
<p class="bas indent1"><span class="nm">(k)</span><span class="cl">Answer:</span> It follows R. Yosi, and there is a dispute as to whether he held that Bnei Pachas were Bnei Yoav or Bnei Adin were Bnei Yoav.</p>

<p class="bas subject"><span class="nm">3)</span>PUSHING ASIDE THE <i>MA'AMAD</i></p>
<p class="bas indent1"><span class="nm">(a)</span><span class="cl">Question:</span> Why did the Mishnah say that Hallel at Shacharis pushes aside the Ma'amad for Shacharis, whereas a Korban Musaf pushes aside the Ma'amad for Minchah?</p>
<p class="bas indent1"><span class="nm">(b)</span><span class="cl">Answer:</span> If the Korban Musaf pushes aside the Ma'amad for a different Tefillah, it certainly pushes aside the Ma'amad for its own Tefillah as well.</p>
<p class="bas indent1"><span class="nm">(c)</span><span class="cl">Question:</span> The intent of the question was, let it <i>only</i> push aside the Ma'amad of Musaf?</p>
<p class="bas indent1"><span class="nm">(d)</span><span class="cl">Answer:</span> Such indeed is the opinion of R. Yosi, who said that on any day where there is Musaf, there is a Ma'amad:</p>
<p class="bas indent2"><span class="nm">1.</span>This cannot refer to the Ma'amad of Shacharis, as then it would be identical to the Tana Kama's view.</p>
<p class="bas indent2"><span class="nm">2.</span>It cannot refer to the Ma'amad of Musaf, because it is impossible that it wouldn't push aside its own Ma'amad.</p>
<p class="bas indent2"><span class="nm">3.</span>So it must mean that there is a Ma'amad of Minchah and Ne'ilah.</p>
<p class="bas indent1"><span class="nm">(e)</span><span class="cl">Question:</span> Why did not the Mishnah also say that on the 1st of Nisan there was no Ma'amad, as there was Hallel, Korban Musaf and Korban Eitzim?</p>
<p class="bas indent1"><span class="nm">(f)</span><span class="cl">Answer:</span> We see here that Hallel on Rosh Chodesh is not d'Oraisa:</p>
<p class="bas indent2"><span class="nm">1.</span>There are eighteen days when we say the whole Hallel: eight of Sukos, eight of Chanukah, one of Pesach and one of Shavuos.</p>
<p class="bas indent2"><span class="nm">2.</span><span class="cl">In the Diaspora, there are twenty-one days:</span> nine of Sukos, eight of Chanukah, two of Pesach and two of Shavuos.</p>
<p class="bas indent1"><span class="nm">(g)</span>When Rav saw Hallel recited on Rosh Chodesh in Bavel, he was going to stop it.</p>
<p class="bas indent2"><span class="nm">1.</span>But when he saw that they skipped paragraphs, he realized that it was only a custom.</p>
<p class="bas indent1"><span class="nm">(h)</span><span class="cl">(Beraisa):</span> An individual should not begin Hallel on Rosh Chodesh; but if he did, he should finish it.</p>
<p class="bas subject"><span class="nm">4)</span>THE TRAGEDIES OF THE 17TH OF TAMUZ</p>
<p class="bas indent1"><span class="nm">(a)</span><span class="cl">Question:</span> The Mishnah said that the Luchos were broken on the 17th of Tamuz - how do we know this?</p>
<p class="bas indent1"><span class="nm">(b)</span><span class="cl">Answer:</span> From the following Beraisa:</p>
<p class="bas indent2"><span class="nm">1.</span><span class="cl">(Tana Kama):</span> The Ten Commandments were given on the sixth of Sivan.</p>
<p class="bas indent2"><span class="nm">2.</span><span class="cl">(R. Yosi):</span> They were given on the seventh.</p>
<p class="bas indent2"><span class="nm">3.</span>According to both, Moshe went up that day to get the Luchos.</p>
<p class="bas indent2"><span class="nm">4.</span>He was there for forty days, descending on the 17th and smashing the Luchos.</p>
<p class="bas indent1"><span class="nm">(c)</span>That the Tamid was annulled on the 17th of Tamuz is known from a received tradition.</p>
<p class="bas indent1"><span class="nm">(d)</span><span class="cl">Question:</span> The Mishnah said that the walls of Yerushalayim were breached on the 17th of Tamuz; but the Pesukim say that it was on the ninth!?</p>
<p class="bas indent1"><span class="nm">(e)</span><span class="cl">Answer:</span> In the time of the first Beis ha'Mikdash, they were breached on the ninth; in the second, on the seventeenth.</p>
<p class="bas indent1"><span class="nm">(f)</span>That Apostemus burned a Torah on the 17th of Tamuz is known from a received tradition.</p>
<p class="bas indent1"><span class="nm">(g)</span>That an idol was placed in the Heichal on the 17th of Tamuz is known from a Pasuk about the abomination.</p>
<p class="bas indent2"><span class="nm">1.</span><span class="cl">Question:</span> Another Pasuk refers to two of them!?</p>
<p class="bas indent2"><span class="nm">2.</span><span class="cl">Answer:</span> Two were placed there, and one fell and broke the other's hand.</p>
