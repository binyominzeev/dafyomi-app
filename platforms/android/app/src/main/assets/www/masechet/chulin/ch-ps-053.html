<div class="indent1"><span class="nm">(a)</span><p><span class="cl">Question (Rav Kahana):</span> Is a cat Matrif?</p></div>
<div class="indent1"><span class="nm">(b)</span><p><span class="cl">Answer (Rav):</span> Even a weasel is Matrif! (All the more so, a cat is.)</p></div>
<div class="indent1"><span class="nm">(c)</span><p><span class="cl">Question (Rav Kahana):</span> Is a weasel Matrif? (All this will be explained shortly.)</p></div>
<div class="indent1"><span class="nm">(d)</span><p><span class="cl">Answer (Rav):</span> Even a cat is not Matrif. (All the more so, a weasel is not.)</p></div>
<div class="indent1"><span class="nm">(e)</span><p><span class="cl">Question (Rav Kahana):</span> Are cats and weasels venomous?</p></div>
<div class="indent1"><span class="nm">(f)</span><p><span class="cl">Answer (Rav):</span> Cats are venomous, but weasels are not.</p></div>
<div class="indent1"><span class="nm">(g)</span><p>We can resolve the apparent contradictions;</p></div>
<div class="indent2"><span class="nm">1.</span><p>Rav said that even a weasel is Matrif birds;</p></div>
<div class="indent2"><span class="nm">2.</span><p>He said that even a cat is not Matrif large sheep;</p></div>
<div class="indent2"><span class="nm">3.</span><p>He said that a cat is Matrif, but not a weasel, if they clawed kids and lambs.</p></div>
<div class="indent1"><span class="nm">(h)</span><p>(The Mishnah taught that a Netz is Matrif small birds, and a Gas (large hawk) is Matrif large birds.)</p></div>
<div class="indent1"><span class="nm">(i)</span><p><span class="cl">Question (Rav Ashi):</span> Are other Tamei birds venomous?</p></div>
<div class="indent1"><span class="nm">(j)</span><p><span class="cl">Answer (Rav Hillel):</span> Yes.</p></div>
<div class="indent1"><span class="nm">(k)</span><p><span class="cl">Question (Mishnah):</span> A Netz is Matrif small birds. (This implies that other birds are not Matrif!)</p></div>
<div class="indent1"><span class="nm">(l)</span><p><span class="cl">Answer #1:</span> A Netz is Matrif birds its own size Any other bird is Matrif only birds smaller than itself.</p></div>
<div class="indent1"><span class="nm">(m)</span><p><span class="cl">Answer #2:</span> A Netz is Matrif birds larger than itself. Any other bird is Matrif only birds its own size (or smaller).</p></div>
<div class="indent1"><span class="nm">(n)</span><p><span class="cl">Version #1 (Rav Kahana):</span> A fox is not venomous.</p></div>
<div class="indent1"><span class="nm">(o)</span><p><span class="cl">Question:</span> Rav Dimi reported that a fox was Dores a ewe, and Chachamim ruled that it is Tereifah!</p></div>
<div class="indent1"><span class="nm">(p)</span><p><span class="cl">Answer (Rav Safra):</span> The case was, a cat was Dores it.</p></div>
<div class="indent1"><span class="nm">(q)</span><p><span class="cl">Version #2 (Rav Kahana):</span> A fox is venomous.</p></div>
<div class="indent1"><span class="nm">(r)</span><p><span class="cl">Question:</span> Rav Dimi reported that a fox was Dores a ewe, and Chachamim ruled that it is Kosher!</p></div>
<div class="indent1"><span class="nm">(s)</span><p><span class="cl">Answer (Rav Safra):</span> The case was, a dog was Dores it;</p></div>
<div class="indent2"><span class="nm">1.</span><p><span class="cl">(Rav Yosef):</span> A dog is not venomous.</p></div>
<div class="subject"><span class="nm">2)</span><p>WHICH SCRATCHES ARE MATRIF?</p></div>
<div class="indent1"><span class="nm">(a)</span><p><span class="cl">(Abaye):</span> We are concerned only for an intentional scratch with the claw of the foreleg, while the attacking animal is alive.</p></div>
<div class="indent1"><span class="nm">(b)</span><p><span class="cl">Inference:</span> We are not concerned for bites, unintentional scratches, scratches with the (claws of the) hind leg, or scratches after the attacker died.</p></div>
<div class="indent1"><span class="nm">(c)</span><p><span class="cl">Question:</span> If unintentional scratches are not a problem, obviously we are not concerned for after the attacker dies!</p></div>
<div class="indent1"><span class="nm">(d)</span><p><span class="cl">Answer:</span> The Chidush is when the foreleg was cut off before it was withdrawn:</p></div>
<div class="indent2"><span class="nm">1.</span><p>One might have thought that it poisons its victim when it inserts the claw. Abaye teaches that this is not so. Rather, the venom comes when it withdraws the claw.</p></div>
<div class="subject"><span class="nm">3)</span><p>CASES OF SAFEK DERISAH</p></div>
<div class="indent1"><span class="nm">(a)</span><p><span class="cl">(Rabah bar bar Chanah citing Rav):</span> If a lion came amidst cattle, and a claw was found in the back of one of them, it is Kosher.</p></div>
<div class="indent1"><span class="nm">(b)</span><p><span class="cl">Question:</span> What is the reason?</p></div>
<div class="indent1"><span class="nm">(c)</span><p><span class="cl">Answer:</span> Even though most lions are Dores, a claw (Tosfos - almost) never comes off. Since a claw came off, we assume that the ox came upon this claw when it scratched itself on the wall.</p></div>
<div class="indent1"><span class="nm">(d)</span><p><span class="cl">Question:</span> (Tosfos - most) oxen that scratch themselves would not get a claw in their back. We should assume that the lion clawed it!</p></div>
<div class="indent1"><span class="nm">(e)</span><p><span class="cl">Conclusion:</span> There are reasons to assume one way and the other. This is like an even doubt, so we leave the ox in its Chazakah. (It is Kosher);</p></div>
<div class="indent2"><span class="nm">1.</span><p>Rav is generally lenient about Safek cases of Derisah.</p></div>
<div class="indent1"><span class="nm">(f)</span><p><span class="cl">(Abaye):</span> This is only if a claw is found, but if only a scratch mark is found, we are concerned.</p></div>
<div class="indent2"><span class="nm">1.</span><p>Even when a claw is found, we are lenient only if it is moist, but not if it is dry, for dry claws often come off.</p></div>
<div class="indent2"><span class="nm">2.</span><p>Even when it is moist, we are lenient only if one was found, but if two or three are found like they are positioned on the paw, we are concerned.</p></div>
<div class="indent1"><span class="nm">(g)</span><p><span class="cl">(Rav):</span> We are not concerned about Safek cases of Derisah.</p></div>
<div class="indent1"><span class="nm">(h)</span><p><span class="cl">(Shmuel):</span> We are concerned.</p></div>
<div class="indent1"><span class="nm">(i)</span><p>Both agree that we are not concerned in the following cases;</p></div>
<div class="indent2"><span class="nm">1.</span><p>If we are unsure whether the attacker entered the herd, we assume that it did not;</p></div>
<div class="indent2"><span class="nm">2.</span><p>If we do not know whether a dog or cat clawed the victim, we assume that it was a dog;</p></div>
<div class="indent2"><span class="nm">3.</span><p>If the attacker is sitting quietly among the herd, we assume that it made peace with them;</p></div>
<div class="indent2"><span class="nm">4.</span><p>If the attacker cut off a head, we assume that this abated its rage, and it was not Dores any others.</p></div>
<div class="indent2"><span class="nm">5.</span><p>If the attacker and the herd are both 'talking', we assume that both are afraid of each other. (It was not Dores.)</p></div>
<div class="bbbline">53b----------------------------------------53b</p></div>
<div class="indent1"><span class="nm">(j)</span><p>They argue when the attacker is quiet, and the herd is noisy:</p></div>
<div class="indent2"><span class="nm">1.</span><p>Shmuel holds that they are noisy because one was clawed. Rav holds that they are merely afraid.</p></div>
<div class="indent1"><span class="nm">(k)</span><p><span class="cl">(Ameimar):</span> The Halachah is, we are concerned.</p></div>
<div class="indent1"><span class="nm">(l)</span><p><span class="cl">Question (Rav Ashi):</span> Rav says that we are not concerned!</p></div>
<div class="indent1"><span class="nm">(m)</span><p><span class="cl">Answer #1:</span> Ameimar holds like Shmuel.</p></div>
<div class="indent1"><span class="nm">(n)</span><p><span class="cl">Answer #2:</span> Rav retracted and agreed with Shmuel.</p></div>
<div class="indent1"><span class="nm">(o)</span><p><span class="cl">Support:</span> The following episode shows that Rav retracted.</p></div>
<div class="indent2"><span class="nm">1.</span><p>Some doubtfully Nidras birds were brought in front of Rav. He sent them to Shmuel to give a ruling. Shmuel choked them and threw them in the river.</p></div>
<div class="indent3"><span class="nm">i.</span><p>If Rav held that they are permitted, he would have permitted them!</p></div>
<div class="indent2"><span class="nm">2.</span><p><span class="cl">Question:</span> If he retracted, and held that they are forbidden, he should have ruled about them himself!</p></div>
<div class="indent1"><span class="nm">(p)</span><p><span class="cl">Answer (and rejection of support):</span> Rather, Rav didn't retract. (This is why he did not forbid them himself);</p></div>
<div class="indent2"><span class="nm">1.</span><p>He did not want to permit them, for this is unlike Shmuel, and the question was asked in Shmuel's area.</p></div>
<div class="indent2"><span class="nm">2.</span><p><span class="cl">Question:</span> Why did Shmuel choke them before throwing them in the river?</p></div>
<div class="indent2"><span class="nm">3.</span><p><span class="cl">Answer:</span> He was concerned lest they fly away (and someone find them, unaware that they were clawed).</p></div>
<div class="indent2"><span class="nm">4.</span><p><span class="cl">Question:</span> Why didn't he wait 12 months? (If they lived, this would prove that they are not Tereifos!)</p></div>
<div class="indent2"><span class="nm">5.</span><p><span class="cl">Answer:</span> He was concerned lest someone (accidentally) eat them in the interim.</p></div>
<div class="indent2"><span class="nm">6.</span><p><span class="cl">Question:</span> Why didn't he sell them to Nochrim?</p></div>
<div class="indent2"><span class="nm">7.</span><p><span class="cl">Answer:</span> He was concerned lest the Nochrim sell them to a Yisrael.</p></div>
<div class="indent2"><span class="nm">8.</span><p><span class="cl">Question:</span> Why didn't he just throw them in the wasteheap after choking them?</p></div>
<div class="indent3"><span class="nm">i.</span><p><span class="cl">Counter-question:</span> Why didn't he feed them to dogs?</p></div>
<div class="indent2"><span class="nm">9.</span><p><span class="cl">Answer (to both):</span> He wanted to publicize the law that we are concerned for Safek Derisah.</p></div>
<div class="indent1"><span class="nm">(q)</span><p>A goose was bleeding from the neck.</p></div>
<div class="indent1"><span class="nm">(r)</span><p><span class="cl">(Rav Ashi):</span> When we are unsure if a scratch came from a dog or cat, we assume that it came from a dog. Likewise, if we are unsure whether it came from a cat or reed, we assume that it came from a reed.</p></div>
<div class="subject"><span class="nm">4)</span><p>CHECKING A DERUSAH</p></div>
<div class="indent1"><span class="nm">(a)</span><p><span class="cl">(Bnei R. Chiya and Shmuel):</span> One must check around the innards of a clawed animal.</p></div>
<div class="indent1"><span class="nm">(b)</span><p><span class="cl">Question (Ilfa):</span> Are we concerned that venom can affect the Kaneh and Veshet?</p></div>
<div class="indent1"><span class="nm">(c)</span><p><span class="cl">Answer (R. Zeira):</span> From Rav, we learn that we are concerned.</p></div>
<div class="indent2"><span class="nm">1.</span><p><span class="cl">(Rav):</span> One must check around the entire interior of a Derusah, including the Simanim.</p></div>
<div class="indent1"><span class="nm">(d)</span><p><span class="cl">Question (Ilfa):</span> How much must Simanim be uprooted to make the animal Tereifah?</p></div>
<div class="indent1"><span class="nm">(e)</span><p><span class="cl">Answer (R. Zeira citing Rabah bar bar Chanah):</span> The majority must be uprooted.</p></div>
<div class="indent1"><span class="nm">(f)</span><p><span class="cl">Question (R. Ami):</span> If the flesh rotted near a scratch, what is the law?</p></div>
<div class="indent1"><span class="nm">(g)</span><p><span class="cl">Answer (R. Zeira):</span> We learn this from (the second law of) Rav Yehudah.</p></div>
<div class="indent2"><span class="nm">1.</span><p><span class="cl">(Rav Yehudah):</span> If an animal was Nidras, if the flesh near the innards turned red, it is Tereifah;</p></div>
<div class="indent2"><span class="nm">2.</span><p>If flesh rotted, we consider that it was removed. (If removal of that flesh would make an animal Tereifah, it is Tereifah.)</p></div>
<div class="indent1"><span class="nm">(h)</span><p><span class="cl">Question:</span> What is considered rotted flesh?</p></div>
<div class="indent1"><span class="nm">(i)</span><p><span class="cl">Answer (Rav Huna brei d'Rav Yehoshua):</span> If a doctor would remove it, it is like rotted flesh.</p></div>
<div class="indent1"><span class="nm">(j)</span><p><span class="cl">(Rav Ashi):</span> Lungs were brought in front of Rav Kahana. They were fine while resting flat, but when hung, they started crumbling. Rav Kahana said that the animal is Tereifah due to Rav Huna's law.</p></div>
<div class="indent1"><span class="nm">(k)</span><p><span class="cl">(Rav Nachman):</span> We are concerned for a puncture of a thorn only if the wound extends to the inside (i.e. went past the skin). We are concerned for Derisah if the flesh reddens near the innards;</p></div>
<div class="indent2"><span class="nm">1.</span><p>We are concerned for reddening of the Simanim themselves (but not of the surrounding flesh).</p></div>
