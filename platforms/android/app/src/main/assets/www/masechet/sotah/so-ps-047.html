<p class="bas subject"><span class="nm">1)</span>BEARS KILLED THE YOUTHS</p>
<p class="bas indent1"><span class="nm">(a)</span><span class="cl">(Rav or Shmuel):</span> "Two bears came from the forest and killed 42 children" - this was a miracle.</p>
<p class="bas indent1"><span class="nm">(b)</span><span class="cl">(The other of Rav and Shmuel):</span> This was a miracle within a miracle.</p>
<p class="bas indent2"><span class="nm">1.</span>The first opinion holds that a forest already was there. The bears came miraculously.</p>
<p class="bas indent2"><span class="nm">2.</span>The second opinion holds that also the forest came miraculously.</p>
<p class="bas indent1"><span class="nm">(c)</span><span class="cl">Question:</span> Why was it necessary to miraculously bring a forest. It suffices to bring bears!</p>
<p class="bas indent1"><span class="nm">(d)</span><span class="cl">Answer:</span> The bears would be too timid to attack if they did not have a place to hide.</p>
<p class="bas indent1"><span class="nm">(e)</span><span class="cl">(R. Chanina):</span> Because of the 42 Korbanos that Balak brought, 42 children of Yisrael died.</p>
<p class="bas indent1"><span class="nm">(f)</span><span class="cl">Question:</span> Rav Yehudah taught that his reward was that Rus descended from him, and from her Shlomo, who brought thousands of Korbanos!</p>
<p class="bas indent2"><span class="nm">1.</span><span class="cl">(R. Yosi ben Choni):</span> Rus was the daughter of Eglon, who was the son of Balak.</p>
<p class="bas indent2"><span class="nm">2.</span>We learn from Balak that one should always engage in Torah and Mitzvos, even Lo Lishmah (for ulterior motives), for he will come to engage in them Lishmah!</p>
<p class="bas indent1"><span class="nm">(g)</span><span class="cl">Answer:</span> Balak's intention was to curse Yisrael (i.e. to diminish Yisrael; this was fulfilled).</p>
<p class="bas indent1"><span class="nm">(h)</span><span class="cl">Question:</span> "The people of the city told Elisha, this is a good city, as you can see." How could they say this? The water was bad, and there were miscarriages!</p>
<p class="bas indent1"><span class="nm">(i)</span><span class="cl">Answer (R. Chanin):</span> People love the place they live in.</p>
<p class="bas indent2"><span class="nm">1.</span><span class="cl">(R. Yochanan):</span> Three things always find grace: people love the place they live in, a wife has grace in the eyes of her husband, and a buyer is happy with what he bought.</p>
<p class="bas subject"><span class="nm">2)</span>REBUKE SHOULD NOT BE TOO HARSH</p>
<p class="bas indent1"><span class="nm">(a)</span><span class="cl">(Beraisa):</span> Elisha fell sick three times. One was (punishment) for bringing the bears (through his curse), one was for casting off Gechazi with both hands, and one was the sickness he died from.</p>
<p class="bas indent1"><span class="nm">(b)</span><span class="cl">(Beraisa):</span> One should dispel with the left hand, and bring close with the right, unlike Elisha and Yehoshua ben Perachyah, who dispelled with both hands.</p>
<p class="bas indent2"><span class="nm">1.</span><span class="cl">Question:</span> Why did Elisha rebuke Gechazi "you took (from Na'aman) the money, garments, olives, vineyards, flock, cattle, male and female servants"? He took only money and garments!</p>
<p class="bas indent2"><span class="nm">2.</span><span class="cl">Answer (R. Yitzchak):</span> At the time, Gechazi was learning about the eight Sheratzim (rodents) from Elisha. Elisha mentioned eight things in his rebuke to hint to him 'the time has come for you to receive your reward for learning about the eight rodents.' (The Targum of the verse says that Gechazi intended to buy these things with the money.)</p>
<p class="bas indent1"><span class="nm">(c)</span><span class="cl">(R. Yochanan):</span> "The Tzara'as of Na'aman should cling to you forever" - the four Metzoras mentioned later (the Haftorah for Parshas Metzora) are Gechazi and his three sons.</p>
<p class="bas indent1"><span class="nm">(d)</span><span class="cl">(R. Yochanan):</span> "Elisha went to Damesek" - he went to get Gechazi to repent.</p>
<p class="bas indent2"><span class="nm">1.</span><span class="cl">Gechazi:</span> You taught me that if one sinned and made many others sin, he is not able to repent.</p>
<p class="bas indent1"><span class="nm">(e)</span><span class="cl">Question:</span> What did Gechazi do?</p>
<p class="bas indent1"><span class="nm">(f)</span><span class="cl">Answer #1:</span> He used a magnet to suspend Yeravam's idols in the air (to make people believe that they have powers).</p>
<p class="bas indent1"><span class="nm">(g)</span><span class="cl">Answer #2:</span> He carved Hash-m's name on the mouth of the idol, and the idol would say the first two of the Aseres ha'Dibros (commanding people to worship only it).</p>
<p class="bas indent1"><span class="nm">(h)</span><span class="cl">Answer #3:</span> He rejected Talmidim who wanted to learn from Elisha.</p>
<p class="bas indent2"><span class="nm">1.</span>After he left, there were so many Talmidim that they were cramped.</p>
<p class="bas indent1"><span class="nm">(i)</span>When King Yanai killed the Chachamim, his wife hid her brother, Shimon ben Shetach, to save him. R. Yehoshua ben Perachyah fled to Alexandria. When the danger subsided, Shimon ben Shetach wrote to R. Yehoshua, suggesting that he return.</p>
<p class="bas indent1"><span class="nm">(j)</span>On his way back, he stayed at an inn; the innkeeper showed great honor.</p>
<p class="bas indent2"><span class="nm">1.</span><span class="cl">R. Yehoshua ben Perachyah:</span> Our hostess is very nice!</p>
<p class="bas indent2"><span class="nm">2.</span><span class="cl">A Talmid (Yeshu):</span> But her eyes are round!</p>
<p class="bas indent2"><span class="nm">3.</span><span class="cl">R. Yehoshua:</span> Rasha! You gaze at married women?!</p>
<p class="bas indent1"><span class="nm">(k)</span>R. Yehoshua excommunicated him, and 400 people publicized this. Each day, the Talmid came before him, but he refused to see him. One day, he came before him when R. Yehoshua was reading Shema Yisrael. He gestured that he would see him when he finished.</p>
<p class="bas indent1"><span class="nm">(l)</span>The Talmid misinterpreted the gesture, and thought that he would not see him. He set up a brick and worshipped it.</p>
<p class="bas indent2"><span class="nm">1.</span><span class="cl">R. Yehoshua:</span> Repent!</p>
<p class="bas indent2"><span class="nm">2.</span><span class="cl">The Talmid:</span> You taught me that if one sinned and made many sin, he is not able to repent.</p>
<p class="bas indent2"><span class="nm">3.</span>The Talmid did witchcraft, enticed individuals and the masses to serve idols, and caused Yisrael to sin.</p>
<p class="bas indent1"><span class="nm">(m)</span><span class="cl">(R. Shimon ben Elazar):</span> The left hand should repel the following, and the right hand should draw them close: the evil inclination, a child, and a wife.</p>
<p class="bas subject"><span class="nm">3)</span>BEHEADING THE CALF</p>
<p class="bas indent1"><span class="nm">(a)</span><span class="cl">(Mishnah):</span> If the murderer was found before beheading the calf, the calf may graze with the herd (i.e. it is totally permitted);</p>
<p class="bas indent2"><span class="nm">1.</span>If he was found after the calf was beheaded, it is buried in its place. It is always brought to atone before the murderer is found, lest he not be found! Finding the murderer later does not change the status of the calf.</p>
<p class="bas indent1"><span class="nm">(b)</span>If the murderer is found after beheading the calf, he is killed.</p>
<p class="bas indent1"><span class="nm">(c)</span>If one witness says that he saw the murderer, and one witness contradicts him; or, one woman says that she saw the murderer, and one woman contradicts her, we behead a calf;</p>
<p class="bas indent1"><span class="nm">(d)</span>If one witness says that he saw, and two witnesses contradict him, we behead. If two witnesses say that they saw, and one witness contradicts them, we do not behead.</p>
<p class="bas indent1"><span class="nm">(e)</span>After murder became widespread, Eglah Arufah was abolished;</p>
<p class="bas indent2"><span class="nm">1.</span>This was in the days of Eliezer ben Dinai, who was called Techina ben Prisha. They started calling him the murdering son.</p>
<p class="bas indent1"><span class="nm">(f)</span>When adultery became rampant, R. Yochanan ben Zakai abolished the Sotah water - "I will not visit upon your daughters, for they have Bi'as Znus, and your daughter-in-laws, for they commit adultery..."</p>
<p class="bas indent1"><span class="nm">(g)</span>When Yosi ben Yo'ezer of Tzreidah and Yosi ben Yehudah of Yerushalayim died, there were no more clusters (this will be explained).</p>
<p class="bas indent1"><span class="nm">(h)</span>Yochanan Kohen Gadol abolished Viduy Ma'asros (in which one says that he gave Ma'asros properly), the arousers, and the beaters (this will be explained);</p>
<p class="bas bbbline">47b----------------------------------------47b</p>
<p class="bas indent2"><span class="nm">1.</span>Until his day, one would hear hammers in Yerushalayim.</p>
<p class="bas indent1"><span class="nm">(i)</span>In his day, there was no need to ask about doubtfully tithed produce.</p>
<p class="bas indent1"><span class="nm">(j)</span><span class="cl">(Gemara - Beraisa):</span> "Atonement for the land will only come through the blood of the murderer" teaches that if the murderer is found after beheading the calf, he is killed.</p>
<p class="bas subject"><span class="nm">4)</span>ONE WITNESS IS BELIEVED</p>
<p class="bas indent1"><span class="nm">(a)</span><span class="cl">(Mishnah):</span> If one witness says that he saw the murderer...</p>
<p class="bas indent1"><span class="nm">(b)</span><span class="cl">Inference:</span> We behead only because one witness contradicts him. If not, the witness would be believed.</p>
<p class="bas indent1"><span class="nm">(c)</span><span class="cl">Question:</span> What is the source for this?</p>
<p class="bas indent1"><span class="nm">(d)</span><span class="cl">Answer (Beraisa):</span> "It is not known who killed him" - if even one person at the end of the world knows, we do not behead.</p>
<p class="bas indent1"><span class="nm">(e)</span>R. Akiva says, "our eyes did not see" - if the Sanhedrin saw the murder, even though they do not recognize the murderer, we do not bring a calf.</p>
<p class="bas indent1"><span class="nm">(f)</span><span class="cl">Question:</span> If one witness is believed, how can one witness contradict him?</p>
<p class="bas indent2"><span class="nm">1.</span><span class="cl">(Ula):</span> Wherever the Torah believed one witness, he is believed like two. The other witness is not believed against two!</p>
<p class="bas indent1"><span class="nm">(g)</span><span class="cl">Answer #1 (Ula and R. Yitzchak):</span> The Mishnah should say that a calf is not brought.</p>
<p class="bas indent1"><span class="nm">(h)</span><span class="cl">(R. Chiya):</span> A calf is brought.</p>
<p class="bas indent1"><span class="nm">(i)</span><span class="cl">Question:</span> How does R. Chiya answer question (f)?</p>
<p class="bas indent1"><span class="nm">(j)</span><span class="cl">Answer #2:</span> The Mishnah discusses when the witnesses testify together. Ula's law applies only when they come at different times.</p>
<p class="bas indent1"><span class="nm">(k)</span><span class="cl">(Mishnah):</span> If one witness says that he saw, and two contradict him, a calf is brought.</p>
<p class="bas indent1"><span class="nm">(l)</span><span class="cl">Inference:</span> If only one witness contradicted him, a calf is not brought.</p>
<p class="bas indent1"><span class="nm">(m)</span><span class="cl">Question:</span> This refutes R. Chiya!</p>
<p class="bas indent2"><span class="nm">1.</span><span class="cl">Counter-question (Mishnah):</span> If two say that they saw, and one contradicts them, a calf is not brought.</p>
<p class="bas indent2"><span class="nm">2.</span><span class="cl">Inference:</span> If only one witness saw, a calf is brought. (This supports R. Chiya and refutes Ula!)</p>
<p class="bas indent1"><span class="nm">(n)</span><span class="cl">Answer to both questions:</span> Both Ula and R. Chiya must explain that these two clauses discuss invalid witnesses, like R. Nechemyah taught:</p>
<p class="bas indent2"><span class="nm">1.</span><span class="cl">(Beraisa - R. Nechemyah):</span> Wherever the Torah believed one witness, we follow the majority;</p>
<p class="bas indent2"><span class="nm">2.</span><span class="cl">Version #1:</span> Two women who contradict a man are like two men who contradict a man (and they are believed. One woman is not believed to contradict a man.)</p>
<p class="bas indent2"><span class="nm">3.</span><span class="cl">Version #2:</span> If a valid witness came first, even if 100 women later contradict him, they are only like one man (and they are not believed, since the valid witness was believed like two);</p>
<p class="bas indent3"><span class="nm">i.</span>The Mishnah discusses when a woman testified first.</p>
<p class="bas indent2"><span class="nm">4.</span>We explain R. Nechemya's words as follows. Wherever the Torah believed one witness, we follow the majority. Two women who contradict one woman are like two men who contradict a man (they are believed);</p>
<p class="bas indent2"><span class="nm">5.</span>If two women contradict one man, we are in doubt who to believe.</p>
<p class="bas indent1"><span class="nm">(o)</span><span class="cl">Question:</span> Why must the Mishnah teach two clauses about invalid witnesses?</p>
<p class="bas indent1"><span class="nm">(p)</span><span class="cl">Answer:</span> One might have thought that we follow the majority (of invalid witnesses) only to be stringent. The other clause teaches that we follow them even to be lenient.</p>
<p class="bas subject"><span class="nm">5)</span>THE DECLINE OF RIGHTEOUSNESS</p>
<p class="bas indent1"><span class="nm">(a)</span><span class="cl">(Mishnah):</span> After murder became widespread...</p>
<p class="bas indent1"><span class="nm">(b)</span><span class="cl">(Beraisa):</span> After murder became widespread, Eglah Arufah was abolished, since it comes only when the murderer is unknown;</p>
<p class="bas indent2"><span class="nm">1.</span>The murderers killed in public.</p>
<p class="bas indent1"><span class="nm">(c)</span><span class="cl">(Mishnah):</span> When adultery became rampant...</p>
<p class="bas indent1"><span class="nm">(d)</span><span class="cl">(Beraisa):</span> "The man will be clean from sin" - the water checks his wife only when her husband is clean from sin.</p>
<p class="bas indent2"><span class="nm">1.</span>It also says "I will not visit upon your daughters, for they have Bi'as Znus..."</p>
<p class="bas indent1"><span class="nm">(e)</span><span class="cl">Question:</span> Why is the second verse needed?</p>
<p class="bas indent1"><span class="nm">(f)</span><span class="cl">Answer:</span> One might have thought that his own sin prevents the water from working, but the sin of his children does not. The second verse teaches that this is not so.</p>
<p class="bas indent1"><span class="nm">(g)</span><span class="cl">Suggestion:</span> Perhaps only adultery prevents the water from working, but not Bi'ah with a single woman!</p>
<p class="bas indent1"><span class="nm">(h)</span><span class="cl">Rejection:</span> "They are company with harlots..."</p>
<p class="bas indent1"><span class="nm">(i)</span><span class="cl">Question:</span> What does it mean "a nation that does not understand will grow weary (from punishments)"?</p>
<p class="bas indent1"><span class="nm">(j)</span><span class="cl">Answer (R. Elazar):</span> The Navi told them: if you yourselves conduct morally, the water will test your wives. If not, it will not.</p>
<p class="bas indent1"><span class="nm">(k)</span><span class="cl">(Continuation of Beraisa):</span> When judges who seek pleasures increased, judgments became distorted and deeds became perverted, and the world is not pleasing to Hash-m;</p>
<p class="bas indent1"><span class="nm">(l)</span>When judges who show favoritism became rampant, "do not fear (in judgment)" ceased;</p>
<p class="bas indent2"><span class="nm">1.</span>They cast of the yoke of Heaven, and the yoke of human kings was put upon them.</p>
<p class="bas indent1"><span class="nm">(m)</span>When those who try to persuade judges became rampant, Hash-m's anger against Yisrael increased, and the Divine Presence departed - "Hash-m will judge amidst the judges."</p>
<p class="bas indent1"><span class="nm">(n)</span>When those who pursue pleasure became rampant, flatterers increased. When flatterers increased, woe increased;</p>
<p class="bas indent1"><span class="nm">(o)</span>When those who draw out their spit became rampant, haughtiness increased, and Talmidim decreased, and the Torah seeks those who will learn it;</p>
<p class="bas indent2"><span class="nm">1.</span>When haughtiness increased, Bnos Yisrael started marrying haughty men. In our generation, only the external is seen.</p>
<p class="bas indent2"><span class="nm">2.</span><span class="cl">Question:</span> It was taught that if one is haughty, even his household disgraces him. "A haughty man's dwelling will not last" - he will not even dwell in his home! (If so, why did girls marry such men?)</p>
<p class="bas indent2"><span class="nm">3.</span><span class="cl">Answer:</span> At first, she wanted to marry him. Later, he was disgraced in her eyes.</p>
<p class="bas indent1"><span class="nm">(p)</span>When judges who ask merchants to do business for them became rampant, bribery and tilting of judgment increased, and goodness ended;</p>
<p class="bas indent2"><span class="nm">1.</span>When judges who showed their appreciation of favors became rampant, there was an increase in people doing like they see fit. The lowly were raised, the great ones were lowered, and the kingship in Yisrael degenerated.</p>
<p class="bas indent1"><span class="nm">(q)</span>When stingy people and thieves became rampant, there was more callousness and refusal to lend to money;</p>
<p class="bas indent2"><span class="nm">1.</span>People transgressed "lest there be a base thought in your heart (and you will refuse to lend out of fear lest Shemitah cancel the loan)."</p>
<p class="bas indent1"><span class="nm">(r)</span>When people who walk with raised necks and scorning eyes became rampant, there were more Sotos, but they ceased to drink.</p>
<p class="bas indent1"><span class="nm">(s)</span>When people who receive gifts became rampant, days and years were shortened - "one who hates gifts will live."</p>
<p class="bas subject"><span class="nm">6)</span>THE DECLINE IN TORAH</p>
<p class="bas indent1"><span class="nm">(a)</span>When people who rely on their own understanding became rampant, dispute increased in Yisrael;</p>
<p class="bas indent1"><span class="nm">(b)</span>When the Talmidim of Hillel and Shamai increased, who did not learn long enough from their Rabbis, dispute became rampant, and it is as if there are two Toros (Beis Shamai and Beis Hillel);</p>
<p class="bas indent1"><span class="nm">(c)</span>When people who take Tzedakah from Nochrim became rampant, Yisrael rose and they declined. (All this is a euphemism for the opposite.) Yisrael was in front, and there were in back.</p>
<p class="bas indent1"><span class="nm">(d)</span><span class="cl">(Mishnah):</span> When Yosi ben Yo'ezer of Tzreidah died... (the clusters ceased).</p>
<p class="bas indent1"><span class="nm">(e)</span><span class="cl">Question:</span> What are the clusters?</p>
<p class="bas indent1"><span class="nm">(f)</span><span class="cl">Answer (Rav Yehudah):</span> They are men who contain everything (Chachmos and good traits).</p>
