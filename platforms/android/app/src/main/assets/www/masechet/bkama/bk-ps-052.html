<p class="bas indent1"><span class="nm">(a)</span><span class="cl">(R. Elazar):</span> If Reuven sold a well to Shimon, once he hands over the cover, he acquires the well.</p>

<p class="bas indent2"><span class="nm">2.</span>If he acquired it with Chazakah, that is the acquisition!</p>
<p class="bas indent1"><span class="nm">(c)</span><span class="cl">Answer:</span> Really, he acquired with Chazakah. Normally, Reuven must say 'go make a Chazakah';</p>
<p class="bas indent2"><span class="nm">1.</span>Handing over the cover is like saying 'go make a Chazakah.'</p>
<p class="bas indent1"><span class="nm">(d)</span><span class="cl">(R. Yehoshua ben Levi):</span> If Reuven sold a house to Shimon, once he hands over the key, he acquires the house.</p>
<p class="bas indent1"><span class="nm">(e)</span><span class="cl">Question:</span> What is the case?</p>
<p class="bas indent2"><span class="nm">1.</span>If he acquired it with money, that is the acquisition!</p>
<p class="bas indent2"><span class="nm">2.</span>If he acquired it with Chazakah, that is the acquisition!</p>

<p class="bas indent2"><span class="nm">1.</span>Handing over the Mashchuchis is like saying 'go do Meshichah.'</p>
<p class="bas indent1"><span class="nm">(j)</span><span class="cl">Question:</span> What is the Mashchuchis?</p>
<p class="bas indent1"><span class="nm">(k)</span><span class="cl">Answer #1 (Chachamim of Bavel):</span> It is the bell one rings to make the herd come.</p>
<p class="bas indent1"><span class="nm">(l)</span><span class="cl">Answer #2 (R. Yakov):</span> It is the goat that goes at the front.</p>
<p class="bas indent1"><span class="nm">(m)</span><span class="cl">(A Galilean, in front of Rav Chisda):</span> When a shepherd is angry at the flock, he blinds the lead goat. (It will fall in a pit, and they will follow it. Similarly, when Hash-m wants to punish Yisrael, He appoints an improper leader.)</p>
<p class="bas subject"><span class="nm">2)</span>WHICH PARTNER IS RESPONSIBLE?</p>
<p class="bas indent1"><span class="nm">(a)</span><span class="cl">(Mishnah):</span> If Reuven covered the pit, and Shimon found it uncovered and did not cover it, Shimon is liable;</p>

<p class="bas indent1"><span class="nm">(d)</span>If an ox fell in with its Kelim and they broke, or a donkey with its Kelim and they tore, he is liable for the animals, but not for the Kelim.</p>
<p class="bas indent1"><span class="nm">(e)</span>If an ox fell in, if it (alternatively, the owner) was deaf, insane, or a child, the owner is paid;</p>
<p class="bas indent2"><span class="nm">1.</span>If it (or he) was a child or slave, no payment is made.</p>
<p class="bas indent1"><span class="nm">(f)</span><span class="cl">(Gemara) Question:</span> Until when is Reuven exempt?</p>
<p class="bas indent1"><span class="nm">(g)</span><span class="cl">Answer #1 (Rav):</span> He is exempt until he sees that it is uncovered.</p>
<p class="bas indent1"><span class="nm">(h)</span><span class="cl">Answer #2 (Shmuel):</span> He is exempt until he is told that it is uncovered.</p>
<p class="bas indent1"><span class="nm">(i)</span><span class="cl">Answer #3 (R. Yochanan):</span> He is exempt until he is told that it is uncovered and can hire workers to cut trees to cover it.</p>

<p class="bas indent1"><span class="nm">(a)</span><span class="cl">(Mishnah):</span> If Reuven properly covered a pit and an animal fell in and died, he is exempt.</p>
<p class="bas indent1"><span class="nm">(b)</span><span class="cl">Question:</span> If it was covered properly, how did an animal fall in?</p>
<p class="bas indent1"><span class="nm">(c)</span><span class="cl">Answer (R. Yitzchak bar bar Chanah):</span> Worms corroded the cover.</p>
<p class="bas indent1"><span class="nm">(d)</span><span class="cl">Version #1 - Question:</span> If Reuven's pit was covered properly for oxen to pass over, but not for camels, and camels passed over and weakened it, then oxen fell in, what is the law?</p>
<p class="bas indent2"><span class="nm">1.</span><span class="cl">Question:</span> What is the case?</p>
<p class="bas indent3"><span class="nm">i.</span>If camels often go there, Reuven was negligent!</p>
<p class="bas indent3"><span class="nm">ii.</span>If camels do not go there, this is Ones!</p>
<p class="bas indent2"><span class="nm">2.</span><span class="cl">Answer:</span> The case is, camels occasionally go there.</p>
<p class="bas indent3"><span class="nm">i.</span>Do we say, he should have realized that camels might go there?</p>
<p class="bas indent3"><span class="nm">ii.</span>Or, since there were not camels at the time, he is Ones.</p>
<p class="bas indent1"><span class="nm">(e)</span><span class="cl">Answer #1 (Mishnah):</span> If he covered it properly and an ox or donkey fell in and died, he is exempt.</p>

<p class="bas indent2"><span class="nm">4.</span><span class="cl">Answer #1:</span> It was covered properly for oxen, but not for camels (and camels passed over and weakened it).</p>
<p class="bas bbbline">52b----------------------------------------52b</p>
<p class="bas indent2"><span class="nm">5.</span><span class="cl">Question:</span> We cannot say that camels often go there, for if so he was negligent, and he would be liable!</p>
<p class="bas indent3"><span class="nm">i.</span>If camels do not go there, this is Ones. Obviously, he is exempt!</p>
<p class="bas indent2"><span class="nm">6.</span><span class="cl">Answer:</span> We must say that camels occasionally go there. (The Mishnah says that he is liable. This answers question (d)).</p>
<p class="bas indent1"><span class="nm">(f)</span><span class="cl">Rejection (and Answer #2 to Question e:3 - R. Yitzchak bar bar Chanah):</span> It was covered properly for oxen and camels, and worms corroded the cover.</p>

<p class="bas indent1"><span class="nm">(h)</span><span class="cl">Rejection (and Answer #2 to Question g:1):</span> Really, it was covered properly for oxen, but not for camels, and camels are common;</p>
<p class="bas indent2"><span class="nm">1.</span>Indeed, it is no Chidush that he is liable. The case was taught for parallel structure.</p>
<p class="bas indent1"><span class="nm">(i)</span><span class="cl">Version #2:</span> We need not ask about a pit covered properly for oxen, but not for camels. Clearly, he is negligent, since camels sometimes go there! Rather, we ask about the following.</p>

<p class="bas indent2"><span class="nm">1.</span>Do we say that since he was negligent regarding camels, he is liable also for corrosion;</p>
<p class="bas indent2"><span class="nm">2.</span>Or, do we not say so?</p>
<p class="bas indent1"><span class="nm">(k)</span><span class="cl">Answer #1 (Mishnah):</span> If it was covered properly, and an ox or donkey fell in, he is exempt.</p>

<p class="bas indent3"><span class="nm">i.</span>If it was covered properly for oxen and camels, clearly, he is exempt. What else could he have done?!</p>
<p class="bas indent2"><span class="nm">3.</span><span class="cl">Answer #1:</span> Rather, it was covered properly for oxen, but not for camels, and camels often come. We do not say that since he was negligent regarding camels, he is liable also for corrosion. (This answers Question (j).)</p>
<p class="bas indent1"><span class="nm">(l)</span><span class="cl">Rejection (and Answer #2 to Question k:2):</span> Really, it was covered properly for oxen and camels (and worms corroded it);</p>
<p class="bas indent2"><span class="nm">1.</span>One might have thought that he must regularly test that the cover is still strong. The Mishnah teaches that this is not so.</p>
<p class="bas indent1"><span class="nm">(m)</span><span class="cl">Answer #2 (Mishnah):</span> If it was not covered properly and an ox or donkey fell in, he is liable.</p>

<p class="bas indent2"><span class="nm">4.</span><span class="cl">Answer:</span> Rather, camels often come, and the cover corroded. We say that since he was negligent regarding camels, he is liable also for corrosion. (this answers Question (h)).</p>
<p class="bas indent1"><span class="nm">(n)</span><span class="cl">Rejection (and Answer #2 to Question m:1):</span> Really, it was covered properly for oxen but not for camels. Camels often come, they came and weakened the cover, and then an ox fell in.</p>
<p class="bas indent2"><span class="nm">1.</span>Obviously, he is liable. This case was taught only for parallel structure.</p>
<p class="bas indent1"><span class="nm">(o)</span><span class="cl">Answer #3 (Beraisa):</span> An ox fell in that was deaf, insane, young, blind, or walking at night, (the pit's owner) is liable;</p>
<p class="bas indent2"><span class="nm">1.</span>If a healthy ox fell in during the, he is exempt.</p>
<p class="bas indent2"><span class="nm">2.</span>We do not say that since he is liable for a deaf ox, he is liable also for a healthy ox. (Similarly, liability for camels does not confer liability for corrosion.)</p>
