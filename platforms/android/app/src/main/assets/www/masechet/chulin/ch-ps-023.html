<div class="subject"><span class="nm">1)</span><p>BIRDS NOT VALID FOR KORBANOS</p></div>
<div class="indent1"><span class="nm">(a)</span><p><span class="cl">Answer (Rava - Beraisa):</span> These exclude the beginning of yellowness, which is Pasul for both.</p></div>
<div class="indent2"><span class="nm">1.</span><p>This is like the latter understanding;</p></div>
<div class="indent2"><span class="nm">2.</span><p>If they were Pesulim only due to Safek, we would not need a verse to disqualify this!</p></div>
<div class="indent1"><span class="nm">(b)</span><p><span class="cl">Rejection:</span> Really, we are in doubt which is valid. The verse is needed to disqualify a Nirva (a bird with which a man had relations) and a Ne'evad (worshipped);</p></div>
<div class="indent2"><span class="nm">1.</span><p>One might have thought to learn that they are acceptable, because it says "Mashchasam Bahem Mum Bam" (this will be explained);</p></div>
<div class="indent2"><span class="nm">2.</span><p><span class="cl">(Tana d'Vei R. Yishmael):</span> 'Hashchasah' always refers to incest or idolatry.</p></div>
<div class="indent3"><span class="nm">i.</span><p>"All flesh Hishchis (corrupted) its way on the land" teaches about incest;</p></div>
<div class="indent3"><span class="nm">ii.</span><p>"Lest Tashchisun and you will make an idol..." teaches about idolatry.</p></div>
<div class="indent2"><span class="nm">3.</span><p>Seemingy, the verse equates blemishes with incest and idolatry, to teach that incest and idolatry disqualify only Korbanos that are disqualified by a blemish;</p></div>
<div class="indent3"><span class="nm">i.</span><p>One might have thought that since blemishes do not disqualify birds, neither does incest or idolatry. The Beraisa teaches that this is not so.</p></div>
<div class="subject"><span class="nm">2)</span><p>OTHER INTERMEDIATE CASES</p></div>
<div class="indent1"><span class="nm">(a)</span><p><span class="cl">Question (R. Zeira):</span> If one to bring an Olah of a ram or lamb, and he brought a Palgas (a sheep in its 13th month, did he fulfill his vow?</p></div>
<div class="indent2"><span class="nm">1.</span><p>According to R. Yochanan, clearly he did not;</p></div>
<div class="indent3"><span class="nm">i.</span><p><span class="cl">(Mishnah):</span> If one (was obligated to bring a ram or lamb, and he) offered a Palgas, he brings the Nesachim (accompanying flour and wine offerings) of a ram. He was not Yotzei.</p></div>
<div class="indent3"><span class="nm">ii.</span><p><span class="cl">(R. Yochanan):</span> "Or for a ram" teaches that the Nesachim of a ram are also brought also with a Palgas. (This shows that he holds that a Palgas is neither a ram nor lamb.)</p></div>
<div class="indent2"><span class="nm">2.</span><p>The question is according to Bar Pada, who says that he brings the Nesachim of a ram and stipulates (that if a Palgas is truly a lamb, the extra Nesachim are Nedavos).</p></div>
<div class="bbbline">23b----------------------------------------23b</p></div>
<div class="indent3"><span class="nm">i.</span><p>Is it enough to stipulate 'if a Palgas is really a lamb...'?</p></div>
<div class="indent3"><span class="nm">ii.</span><p>Or, must he stipulate also 'if a Palgas is not a lamb nor ram, but rather a new classification (for which no Nesachim are needed), all the Nesachim are Nedavos'?</p></div>
<div class="indent1"><span class="nm">(b)</span><p>R. Zeira's question is unresolved.</p></div>
<div class="indent1"><span class="nm">(c)</span><p><span class="cl">Question (R. Zeira):</span> If Reuven vowed to bring breads of a Todah (thanksgiving offering) from Chametz or Matzah, and he brought Sei'or (the first stage of Chametz), did he fulfill his vow?</p></div>
<div class="indent2"><span class="nm">1.</span><p><span class="cl">Question:</span> According to which Tana does he ask, and which definition of (what level of fermentation is considered) Sei'or does he use?</p></div>
<div class="indent3"><span class="nm">i.</span><p>If he asks according to R. Yehudah, using R. Meir's definition, R. Yehudah considers it to be Matzah! (Clearly, he fulfilled his vow.)</p></div>
<div class="indent3"><span class="nm">ii.</span><p>If he asks according to R. Meir, using R. Yehudah's definition, R. Meir considers it to be Chametz! (Clearly, he fulfilled his vow.)</p></div>
<div class="indent3"><span class="nm">iii.</span><p><span class="cl">Suggestion:</span> He asks according to R. Meir, using R. Meir's definition of Sei'or.</p></div>
<div class="indent3"><span class="nm">iv.</span><p><span class="cl">Rejection:</span> R. Meir says that one is lashed for eating it on Pesach. This shows that he considers it to be Chametz. (Clearly, he fulfilled his vow.)</p></div>
<div class="indent2"><span class="nm">2.</span><p><span class="cl">Answer:</span> He asks according to R. Yehudah, using R. Yehudah's definition.</p></div>
<div class="indent3"><span class="nm">i.</span><p>If R. Yehudah in doubt if it is Chametz or Matzah, in any case he fulfilled his vow;</p></div>
<div class="indent3"><span class="nm">ii.</span><p>Or, perhaps R. Yehudah holds that Sei'or is neither. If so, he did not fulfill his vow.</p></div>
<div class="indent2"><span class="nm">3.</span><p><span class="cl">Question:</span> How could Reuven fulfill his vow if he does not know if it is Chametz or Matzah?</p></div>
<div class="indent3"><span class="nm">i.</span><p><span class="cl">(Rav Huna):</span> If one accepted to bring the breads of a Todah, he must bring a Todah and (all) the accompanying breads.</p></div>
<div class="indent3"><span class="nm">ii.</span><p><span class="cl">Summation of question:</span> Reuven cannot rely on the Sei'or to exempt himself from bringing the Chametz that accompanies a Todah (perhaps it is not Chametz); similarly, he must bring all the Matzah of a Todah - the Sei'or did not exempt him from anything!</p></div>
<div class="indent2"><span class="nm">4.</span><p><span class="cl">Answer #1:</span> The case is, Reuven accepted to exempt Shimon from the need to bring Chametz or Matzah.</p></div>
<div class="indent2"><span class="nm">5.</span><p><span class="cl">Objection:</span> Due to the above reasoning, Shimon must still bring all the breads. Reuven did not exempt him from anything!</p></div>
<div class="indent2"><span class="nm">6.</span><p><span class="cl">Answer #2:</span> Rather, Reuven accepted to bring Chametz or Matzah that Shimon must bring, but he did not accept to exempt Shimon of his obligation.</p></div>

<div class="subject"><span class="nm">3)</span><p>PARAH ADUMAH AND EGLAH ARUFAH</p></div>
<div class="indent1"><span class="nm">(a)</span><p><span class="cl">(Mishnah):</span> The proper way to kill Parah Adumah is invalid for Eglah Arufah (the calf brought for a found corpse). The proper way to kill Eglah Arufah is invalid for Parah Adumah.</p></div>
<div class="indent1"><span class="nm">(b)</span><p><span class="cl">(Gemara - Beraisa):</span> The Parah Adumah is slaughtered. If it is Arufah (its neck is cleaved from the back), it is invalid. The calf is Arufah. If it is slaughtered; it is invalid.</p></div>
<div class="indent2"><span class="nm">1.</span><p>What is valid for Parah Adumah is invalid for Eglah Arufah. What is valid for Eglah Arufah is invalid for Parah Adumah.</p></div>
