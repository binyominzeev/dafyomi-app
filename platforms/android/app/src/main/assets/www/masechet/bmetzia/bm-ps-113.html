<p class="dedicationbox">BAVA METZIA 112-116 - Two weeks of study material have been dedicated by Mrs. Estanne Abraham Fawer to honor the Yahrzeit of her father, Rav Mordechai ben Eliezer Zvi (Rabbi Morton Weiner) Z'L, who passed away on 18 Teves 5760. May the merit of supporting and advancing Dafyomi study -- which was so important to Rav Weiner -- during the weeks of his Yahrzeit serve as an Iluy for his Neshamah. </p>

<p class="bas subject"><span class="nm">1)</span>AFTER THE WAGES ARE DUE</p>
<p class="bas indent1"><span class="nm">(a)</span><span class="cl">Question:</span> Do we suspect that a worker (who claims payment after the due time) is trying to steal?</p>
<p class="bas indent1"><span class="nm">(b)</span><span class="cl">Answer:</span> Two Chazakos support the employer, and only one supports the worker.</p>
<p class="bas indent2"><span class="nm">1.</span>There is a Chazakah that an employer will not transgress "Lo Salin", and that a worker does not delay claiming his wages;</p>
<p class="bas indent2"><span class="nm">2.</span>The only Chazakah supporting the worker is that we do not suspect him of stealing.</p>
<p class="bas indent1"><span class="nm">(c)</span><span class="cl">(Mishnah):</span> If witnesses saw the worker demand his wages, he swears and collects after the time.</p>
<p class="bas indent1"><span class="nm">(d)</span><span class="cl">Question:</span> Why do witnesses change things? Even without them, we see the worker demanding his wages!</p>
<p class="bas indent1"><span class="nm">(e)</span><span class="cl">Answer (Rav Asi):</span> Witnesses saw the worker demand his wages before the due time.</p>
<p class="bas indent1"><span class="nm">(f)</span><span class="cl">Question:</span> Perhaps the employer paid him afterwards!</p>
<p class="bas indent1"><span class="nm">(g)</span><span class="cl">Answer (Abaye):</span> Witnesses saw the worker claiming the entire time until the deadline.</p>
<p class="bas indent1"><span class="nm">(h)</span><span class="cl">Question:</span> After this, is the employer never believed?!</p>
<p class="bas indent1"><span class="nm">(i)</span><span class="cl">Answer (Rav Chama bar Ukva):</span> The worker is believed to swear (and collect) only the next day.</p>
<p class="bas subject"><span class="nm">2)</span>TAKING A SECURITY</p>
<p class="bas indent1"><span class="nm">(a)</span><span class="cl">(Mishnah):</span> If Reuven lent Shimon, he may Memashken him (take a security from Shimon's house) only through Beis Din.</p>
<p class="bas indent2"><span class="nm">1.</span>He may not enter Shimon's house to take it - "ba'Chutz Ta'amod."</p>
<p class="bas indent1"><span class="nm">(b)</span>If Shimon has two Kelim, Reuven only takes one.</p>
<p class="bas indent1"><span class="nm">(c)</span>Reuven returns a pillow (when Shimon needs it) at night, and a plow for the day.</p>
<p class="bas indent1"><span class="nm">(d)</span>If Shimon dies, he need not return it to the heirs (he may sell it to collect the debt);</p>
<p class="bas indent1"><span class="nm">(e)</span>R. Shimon ben Gamliel says, (even when Shimon is alive) Reuven never need return the security after 30 days. After that, he sells it in Beis Din.</p>
<p class="bas indent1"><span class="nm">(f)</span><span class="cl">(Gemara - Shmuel):</span> The Shali'ach of Beis Din may be Menate'ach (take a security from Shimon in the market), but he may not be Memashken him.</p>
<p class="bas indent1"><span class="nm">(g)</span><span class="cl">Question (Mishnah):</span> If Reuven lent Shimon, he may be Memashken him only  through Beis Din.</p>
<p class="bas indent2"><span class="nm">1.</span>This shows that he may be Memashken him through Beis Din!</p>
<p class="bas indent1"><span class="nm">(h)</span><span class="cl">Answer (Shmuel):</span> The Mishnah means that he may be Menate'ach.</p>
<p class="bas indent1"><span class="nm">(i)</span><span class="cl">Support (Mishnah):</span> He may not enter Shimon's house to take it - "ba'Chutz Ta'amod."</p>
<p class="bas indent2"><span class="nm">1.</span><span class="cl">Question:</span> Who is forbidden to enter?</p>
<p class="bas indent3"><span class="nm">i.</span>It cannot mean Reuven. The first clause teaches this!</p>
<p class="bas indent2"><span class="nm">2.</span><span class="cl">Answer:</span> Rather, the Shali'ach of Beis Din is forbidden.</p>
<p class="bas indent1"><span class="nm">(j)</span><span class="cl">Rejection:</span> No. The Mishnah teaches that Reuven may not Memashken him, but Beis Din may;</p>
<p class="bas indent2"><span class="nm">1.</span>Reuven may not even Menate'ach him (Bach - this is a decree), so he will not come to enter his house.</p>
<p class="bas indent1"><span class="nm">(k)</span><span class="cl">Question (Rav Yosef):</span> "Lo Yachavol Rechayim va'Rachev", but one may be Memashken other things!</p>
<p class="bas indent2"><span class="nm">1.</span>"Lo Sachavol Beged Almanah" - one may be Memashken garments of other people!</p>
<p class="bas indent2"><span class="nm">2.</span><span class="cl">Question:</span> Who may be Memashken other things or people?</p>
<p class="bas indent3"><span class="nm">i.</span>It cannot be the lender - "Lo Savo El Beiso La'avot Avoto"!</p>
<p class="bas indent2"><span class="nm">3.</span><span class="cl">Answer:</span> Rather, it is a Shali'ach of Beis Din.</p>
<p class="bas indent1"><span class="nm">(l)</span><span class="cl">Answer (Rav Papa brei d'Rav Nachman):</span> Really, the verses discuss the lender. He transgresses an extra Lav if he takes a millstone or a widow's garment.</p>
<p class="bas indent1"><span class="nm">(m)</span><span class="cl">(Beraisa) Question:</span> "Ba'Chutz Ta'amod" already teaches that the borrower will take out the security. What do we learn from "veha'Ish"?</p>
<p class="bas indent2"><span class="nm">1.</span><span class="cl">Answer:</span> This includes a Shali'ach of Beis Din.</p>
<p class="bas indent2"><span class="nm">2.</span><span class="cl">Suggestion:</span> A Shali'ach of Beis Din is like the borrower. (He may enter the borrower's house.)</p>
<p class="bas bbbline">113b----------------------------------------113b</p>
<p class="bas indent1"><span class="nm">(n)</span><span class="cl">Answer:</span> No, he is like the lender (he may not enter the borrower's house).</p>
<p class="bas indent1"><span class="nm">(o)</span><span class="cl">Question (Beraisa):</span> "Im Chavol Tachbol Salmas Re'echa" - the verse discusses a Shali'ach of Beis Din.</p>
<p class="bas indent2"><span class="nm">1.</span><span class="cl">Question:</span> Perhaps it discusses the lender!</p>
<p class="bas indent2"><span class="nm">2.</span><span class="cl">Rejection:</span> "Lo Savo El Beiso La'avot Avoto" forbids the lender. "Im Chavol" discusses a Shali'ach of Beis Din.</p>
<p class="bas indent1"><span class="nm">(p)</span><span class="cl">Answer:</span> Tana'im argue about whether or not or not a Shali'ach of Beis Din may be Memashken. Shmuel holds like the following Tana.</p>
<p class="bas indent2"><span class="nm">1.</span><span class="cl">(Beraisa #1):</span> If a Shali'ach of Beis Din comes to Memashken, he may not enter the house - "ba'Chutz Ta'amod veha'Ish (the borrower)" will take out the security.</p>
<p class="bas subject"><span class="nm">3)</span>LEAVING <i>KELIM</i> FOR THE BORROWER</p>
<p class="bas indent1"><span class="nm">(a)</span><span class="cl">(Beraisa #2):</span> If a lender comes to be Memashken, he may not enter the house - "ba'Chutz Ta'amod";</p>
<p class="bas indent2"><span class="nm">1.</span>A Shali'ach of Beis Din may enter the house to be Memashken him.</p>
<p class="bas indent1"><span class="nm">(b)</span>He may not be Memashken things used to make food;</p>
<p class="bas indent1"><span class="nm">(c)</span>He leaves a rich borrower with two beds and a felt blanket. He leaves a poor borrower with two beds and a mattress of reeds.</p>
<p class="bas indent1"><span class="nm">(d)</span>He leaves what the borrower needs himself, not for the borrower's wife and children.</p>
<p class="bas indent1"><span class="nm">(e)</span>Just like we are Mesader (leave essentials) for a borrower, we are Mesader for one who owes money of Erchin.</p>
<p class="bas indent1"><span class="nm">(f)</span><span class="cl">Question:</span> Just the contrary! The Torah teaches Sidur for one who owes Erchin (but does not explicitly teach Sidur for a borrower)!</p>
<p class="bas indent1"><span class="nm">(g)</span><span class="cl">Correction:</span> Rather, just like we are Mesader for one who owes Erchin, also for a borrower.</p>
<p class="bas indent1"><span class="nm">(h)</span><span class="cl">(Beraisa):</span> He leaves a rich borrower with two beds and a felt blanket. He leaves a poor borrower with two beds and a mattress of reeds.</p>
<p class="bas indent1"><span class="nm">(i)</span><span class="cl">Question:</span> For whom does he leave the second bed?</p>
<p class="bas indent2"><span class="nm">1.</span>It cannot be for his wife or children. The Beraisa continues 'he leaves for the borrower himself, not for his wife and children!'</p>
<p class="bas indent1"><span class="nm">(j)</span><span class="cl">Answer:</span> Both are for the borrower. One is to eat on, and one is to sleep on.</p>
<p class="bas indent2"><span class="nm">1.</span><span class="cl">(Shmuel):</span> I know how to cure anything, with three exceptions: one who eats a bitter date on an empty stomach, one who girds a belt of wet flax, and one who does not walk four Amos after eating before he sleeps. (Therefore, it is advisable to have a second bed for sleeping at least four Amos from where he eats.)</p>
<p class="bas indent1"><span class="nm">(k)</span><span class="cl">(A reciter of Beraisos):</span> Just like we are Mesader for one who owes Erchin, we are Mesader for a borrower.</p>
<p class="bas indent1"><span class="nm">(l)</span><span class="cl">Objection (Rav Nachman):</span> We even sell the borrower's property. All the more so, we are not Mesader for him!</p>
<p class="bas indent2"><span class="nm">1.</span><span class="cl">Question:</span> Do we really sell his property?!</p>
<p class="bas indent3"><span class="nm">i.</span><span class="cl">(Mishnah):</span> He returns a pillow at night, and a plow during the day.</p>
<p class="bas indent2"><span class="nm">2.</span><span class="cl">Answer:</span> The Beraisa is like R. Shimon ben Gamliel, who says that we sell a security after 30 days.</p>
<p class="bas indent3"><span class="nm">i.</span><span class="cl">(Mishnah - R. Shimon ben Gamliel):</span> Reuven need not return the security after 30 days. After 30 days, he sells it in Beis Din.</p>
<p class="bas indent2"><span class="nm">3.</span><span class="cl">Question:</span> What is the source that R. Shimon ben Gamliel says that the security is sold entirely to pay the debt?</p>
<p class="bas indent3"><span class="nm">i.</span>Perhaps for 30 days, the security is returned intact, and after this, an expensive security is sold, and the lender buys a (cheaper) replacement appropriate for the borrower!</p>
<p class="bas indent2"><span class="nm">4.</span><span class="cl">Answer:</span> R. Shimon ben Gamliel holds that even an expensive security is appropriate for any Yisrael.</p>
<p class="bas subject"><span class="nm">4)</span><i>BNEI</i> <i>YISRAEL</i> ARE SONS OF KINGS</p>
<p class="bas indent1"><span class="nm">(a)</span><span class="cl">(Abaye):</span> R. Shimon ben Gamliel, R. Shimon, R. Yishmael and R. Akiva all hold that Bnei Yisrael are sons of kings.</p>
<p class="bas indent2"><span class="nm">1.</span><span class="cl">R. Shimon ben Gamliel - (Mishnah):</span> We may not move Luf (a type of legume) nor mustard on Shabbos, since they cannot be used until cooked or ground;</p>
<p class="bas indent3"><span class="nm">i.</span>R. Shimon ben Gamliel permits Luf, since it is food for ravens (it is appropriate for sons of kings to raise ravens).</p>
<p class="bas indent2"><span class="nm">2.</span><span class="cl">R. Shimon - (Mishnah):</span> Sons of kings may rub scented oil on their wounds on Shabbos, for they anoint themselves with scented oil even when they have no wound;</p>
<p class="bas indent3"><span class="nm">i.</span>R. Shimon says, all Bnei Yisrael are sons of kings (and are permitted).</p>
<p class="bas indent2"><span class="nm">3.</span><span class="cl">R. Yishmael and R. Akiva - (Beraisa):</span> If Shimon owed 1000 Zuz, and he was wearing a garment worth 10,000, we make him sell it and buy something fitting for himself;</p>
<p class="bas indent3"><span class="nm">i.</span><span class="cl">(Beraisa - R. Yishmael):</span> Any Yisrael is worthy of such a garment (he need not sell it).</p>
<p class="bas indent3"><span class="nm">ii.</span><span class="cl">(Beraisa - R. Akiva):</span> Any Yisrael is worthy of such a garment.</p>
<p class="bas indent1"><span class="nm">(b)</span><span class="cl">Question:</span> Earlier, we suggested that an expensive security is sold, and the lender buys a (cheaper) replacement fitting for the borrower;</p>
<p class="bas indent2"><span class="nm">1.</span>There are blankets and pillows of varying qualities, but a plow is a plow!</p>
<p class="bas indent1"><span class="nm">(c)</span><span class="cl">Answer (Rava bar Rabah):</span> The security was a silver plow.</p>
<p class="bas indent1"><span class="nm">(d)</span><span class="cl">Question (Rav Chaga):</span> Why can't the lender say 'I am not responsible for your livelihood'?</p>
<p class="bas indent1"><span class="nm">(e)</span><span class="cl">Answer (Abaye):</span> The Torah makes him responsible - "u'Lcha Tihyeh Tzedakah"!</p>
