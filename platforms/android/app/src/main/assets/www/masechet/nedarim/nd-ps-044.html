<p class="bas subject"><span class="nm">1)</span>RETRACTION OF <i>HEFKER</i></p>
<p class="bas indent1"><span class="nm">(a)</span><span class="cl">(Beraisa #1):</span> If Reuven declared his field to be Hefker, for three days he may retract. After this, he cannot retract. (The Rosh holds that someone else can acquire it before Reuven retracts. The Ran disagrees.)</p>
<p class="bas indent1"><span class="nm">(b)</span>If he said 'this field should be Hefker for one day', or week, month, year or Shemitah cycle, if no one has yet acquired the field, he can retract;</p>
<p class="bas indent2"><span class="nm">1.</span>Once someone acquired the field, he cannot retract.</p>
<p class="bas indent1"><span class="nm">(c)</span><span class="cl">Question:</span> The Reisha is like Chachamim, and the Seifa is like R. Yosi (like R. Yochanan said above, that R. Yosi allows retraction from Hefker until someone takes it.)</p>
<p class="bas indent1"><span class="nm">(d)</span><span class="cl">Answer #1 (Ula):</span> Also the Seifa is like Chachamim.</p>
<p class="bas indent1"><span class="nm">(e)</span><span class="cl">Question:</span> If so, why can he retract before someone acquired it?</p>
<p class="bas indent1"><span class="nm">(f)</span><span class="cl">Answer:</span> Hefker for a year or Shemitah cycle is different, for this is not common. (Chachamim agree that he can retract before someone acquired it. It seems that he did not really want someone else to acquire it.)</p>
<p class="bas indent1"><span class="nm">(g)</span><span class="cl">Answer #2 (Reish Lakish):</span> Since the Seifa is like R. Yosi, also the Reisha is like R. Yosi.</p>
<p class="bas indent2"><span class="nm">1.</span>In the Reisha he can retract only for three days, lest the law of Hefker be forgotten. (If he could always retract, it seems that it was not Hefker and must be tithed. Perhaps people will tithe from it, which is really exempt, to exempt real Tevel!)</p>
<p class="bas indent1"><span class="nm">(h)</span><span class="cl">Question:</span> If so, even the first day, he should not be able to retract!</p>
<p class="bas indent1"><span class="nm">(i)</span><span class="cl">Answer (Rabah):</span> Chachamim did not say so, due to swindlers who declare their fields Hefker (to exempt them from tithes) and take them back again. (Since we allow them to retract, it is not Hefker, and tithes must be taken.)</p>
<p class="bas indent1"><span class="nm">(j)</span><span class="cl">Inference:</span> Reish Lakish holds that mid'Oraisa, the field is not Hefker at all.</p>
<p class="bas bbbline">44b----------------------------------------44b</p>
<p class="bas indent1"><span class="nm">(k)</span><span class="cl">Question:</span> If so, perhaps he will come to tithe from produce that must be tithed (i.e. mid'Oraisa it is not Hefker) on what is exempt (true Hefker), or vice-versa!</p>
<p class="bas indent1"><span class="nm">(l)</span><span class="cl">Answer:</span> We inform him that he must tithe the produce of this field from this field itself.</p>
<p class="bas indent1"><span class="nm">(m)</span><span class="cl">Question (Beraisa #2):</span> If one made his vineyard Hefker and promptly harvested it, he must leave the usual gifts for the poor: Peret (grapes that drop during harvesting), Olelos (deficient clusters), Shichechah (grapes forgotten during harvesting), and Pe'ah (a corner of the vineyard unharvested. Hefker is exempt from these, but "abandon" is repeated to obligate when he re-acquired it.)</p>
<p class="bas indent2"><span class="nm">1.</span>He is exempt from Ma'aser.</p>
<p class="bas indent2"><span class="nm">2.</span>We understand according to Ula. The Beraisa is like Chachamim. It teaches that the vineyard is Hefker mid'Oraisa (but mid'Rabanan, he must take Ma'aser.)</p>
<p class="bas indent2"><span class="nm">3.</span>But according to Reish Lakish, why is it exempt from Ma'aser?</p>
<p class="bas indent1"><span class="nm">(n)</span><span class="cl">Answer #1:</span> Reish Lakish explained Beraisa #1 like R. Yosi. He admits that Beraisa #2 is like Chachamim.</p>
