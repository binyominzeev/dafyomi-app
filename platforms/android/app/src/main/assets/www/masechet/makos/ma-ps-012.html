<p class="bas subject"><span class="nm">1)</span>WHICH PLACES ARE <i>KOLET</i></p>
<p class="bas indent1"><span class="nm">(a)</span><span class="cl">(Mishnah):</span> If he was sentenced...</p>
<p class="bas indent1"><span class="nm">(b)</span><span class="cl">(Rav Yehudah):</span> "Va'Yanas Yo'av... va'Yachazek b'Karnos ha'Mizbe'ach" - Yo'av made two mistakes:</p>
<p class="bas indent2"><span class="nm">1.</span>He grabbed the corners of the Mizbe'ach, but the Mizbe'ach is Kolet only someone standing on top;</p>
<p class="bas indent2"><span class="nm">2.</span>Only the Mizbe'ach in the Beis ha'Mikdash is Kolet. He grabbed a Bamah that David had made in front of the Aron (Rashi's text).</p>
<p class="bas indent1"><span class="nm">(c)</span><span class="cl">(Abaye):</span> He made a third mistake. The Mizbe'ach is Kolet only a Kohen engaging in Avodah, but Yo'av was a Zar.</p>
<p class="bas indent1"><span class="nm">(d)</span><span class="cl">(Reish Lakish):</span> The Sar (overseeing angel) of Romi will make three mistakes in the future - "Mi Zeh Ba mi'Edom... mi'Batzrah"</p>
<p class="bas indent2"><span class="nm">1.</span>The Ir Miklat is Betzer, but he went to Batzrah;</p>
<p class="bas indent2"><span class="nm">2.</span>Kelitah is only for Shogeg, but he was Mezid;</p>
<p class="bas indent2"><span class="nm">3.</span>Kelitah is only for people, but he is an angel.</p>
<p class="bas indent1"><span class="nm">(e)</span><span class="cl">(R. Avahu):</span> We do not bury Leviyim in the Arei Miklat. "U'Migresheihem... ul'Chol Chayasam", they are for life, and not for burial.</p>
<p class="bas indent1"><span class="nm">(f)</span><span class="cl">Question (Mishnah):</span> "Shamah" - he will live, die and be buried there.</p>
<p class="bas indent1"><span class="nm">(g)</span><span class="cl">Answer:</span> Burial of murderers is different. The Torah explicitly commanded about it.</p>
<p class="bas indent1"><span class="nm">(h)</span><span class="cl">(Mishnah):</span> Just like the city is Kolet, also its Techum.</p>
<p class="bas indent1"><span class="nm">(i)</span><span class="cl">Contradiction (Beraisa):</span> "V'Yashav Bah" - not in the Techum.</p>
<p class="bas indent1"><span class="nm">(j)</span><span class="cl">Answer (Abaye):</span> The Techum is Kolet, but he may not dwell there.</p>
<p class="bas indent1"><span class="nm">(k)</span><span class="cl">Question:</span> No one may live there!</p>
<p class="bas indent2"><span class="nm">1.</span>We may not convert a Migrash (1000 Amos surrounding a city in each direction) into a field or city, or vice-versa!</p>
<p class="bas indent1"><span class="nm">(l)</span><span class="cl">Answer (Rav Sheshes):</span> Normally, one may dwell in the outskirts under the ground. "Va'Yashav Bah" forbids this to a murderer.</p>
<p class="bas subject"><span class="nm">2)</span>A MURDERER WHO LEFT THE CITY</p>
<p class="bas indent1"><span class="nm">(a)</span><span class="cl">(Mishnah):</span> If a murderer left the Techum...</p>
<p class="bas indent1"><span class="nm">(b)</span><span class="cl">(Beraisa - R. Yosi ha'Galili):</span> "V'Ratzach Go'el ha'Dam Es ha'Rotze'ach" - (if a murderer left the Techum,) it is a Mitzvah for the Go'el ha'Dam to kill him. If there is no Go'el ha'Dam, anyone else is permitted;</p>
<p class="bas indent1"><span class="nm">(c)</span>R. Akiva says, the Go'el ha'Dam may kill him. Anyone else is (Gra's - not) liable if he kills him.</p>
<p class="bas indent1"><span class="nm">(d)</span><span class="cl">Question:</span> What is R. Yosi ha'Galili's reason?</p>
<p class="bas indent1"><span class="nm">(e)</span><span class="cl">Answer:</span> It does not say 'Im' (if). It says "v'Ratzach" (imperative, he will kill)!</p>
<p class="bas indent2"><span class="nm">1.</span>R. Akiva says, had it said 'Yirtzach', this would clearly be imperative, but 'v'Ratzach' can be Reshus! (Ritva - R. Akiva agrees that this tense usually denotes the imperative, but we do not expound to kill unless it is explicit.)</p>
<p class="bas indent1"><span class="nm">(f)</span><span class="cl">(Rav Zutra bar Tuvya):</span> If the Go'el ha'Dam found and killed the murderer outside the Ir Miklat (R. Chananel - before Beis Din ruled that he is exiled), he is killed.</p>
<p class="bas indent1"><span class="nm">(g)</span><span class="cl">Question:</span> This is not like either Tana!</p>
<p class="bas indent1"><span class="nm">(h)</span><span class="cl">Answer:</span> He holds like R. Eliezer;</p>
<p class="bas indent2"><span class="nm">1.</span><span class="cl">(Beraisa - R. Eliezer) Question:</span> What do we learn from "Ad Amdo Lifnei ha'Edah la'Mishpat"?</p>
<p class="bas indent2"><span class="nm">2.</span><span class="cl">Answer:</span> One might have thought that "v'Ratzach Go'el ha'Dam Es ha'Rotze'ach" teaches that he should kill him immediately. "Ad Amdo..." teaches that this is only after he is warned not to leave (Ritva; R. Chananel - until Beis Din sentences him to Galus).</p>
<p class="bas indent1"><span class="nm">(i)</span><span class="cl">Question:</span> How do R. Akiva and R. Yosi expound "Ad Amdo..."?</p>
<p class="bas indent1"><span class="nm">(j)</span><span class="cl">Answer (Beraisa - R. Akiva):</span> If the Sanhedrin witnessed a murder, they do not kill him. He is tried in a different Beis Din - "Ad Amdo Lifnei ha'Edah la'Mishpat."</p>
<p class="bas indent1"><span class="nm">(k)</span><span class="cl">(Beraisa #1) Suggestion:</span> Perhaps "Im Yatzo Yezte ha'Rotze'ach" (he may be killed) is only if he left his city b'Mezid!</p>
<p class="bas indent2"><span class="nm">1.</span><span class="cl">Rejection:</span> "Im Yatzo Yezte" - the verb is doubled to include even Shogeg.</p>
<p class="bas indent1"><span class="nm">(l)</span><span class="cl">Version #1 - Rambam's text - Contradiction (Beraisa #2):</span> (If he left b'Shogeg), if someone (the Go'el ha'Dam or anyone else) kills him b'Mezid is killed, b'Shogeg he is exiled.</p>
<p class="bas indent1"><span class="nm">(m)</span><span class="cl">Version #2 - Ritva's text - Contradiction (Beraisa #2):</span> If he left b'Mezid he is killed. If he left b'Shogeg he returns to Galus. (end of Version #2)</p>
<p class="bas indent1"><span class="nm">(n)</span><span class="cl">Resolution:</span> The Tana of Beraisa #2 holds that the Torah speaks as people do (they sometimes double words, therefore, we need not expound this). The first Tana does not.</p>
<p class="bas indent1"><span class="nm">(o)</span><span class="cl">(Abaye):</span> It is more reasonable to learn like Beraisa #2. His liability for leaving the city should not be more stringent than for killing;</p>
<p class="bas indent2"><span class="nm">1.</span>One who kills b'Mezid is killed, but b'Shogeg he is only exiled. It suffices to make him just as liable for leaving the city!</p>
<p class="bas indent1"><span class="nm">(p)</span><span class="cl">(Beraisa #1):</span> If a father killed (his son), his son becomes the Go'el ha'Dam.</p>
<p class="bas indent1"><span class="nm">(q)</span><span class="cl">Contradiction: (Beraisa #2):</span> If a father killed (his son), his son does not become Go'el ha'Dam.</p>
<p class="bas indent1"><span class="nm">(r)</span><span class="cl">Suggestion:</span> Beraisa #1 is like R. Yosi ha'Galili (since it is a Mitzvah to kill, even a son can do this). Beraisa #2 is like R. Akiva (who holds that it is only Reshus.)</p>
<p class="bas indent1"><span class="nm">(s)</span><span class="cl">Rejection:</span> Even if it is a Mitzvah, a son may not kill his father!</p>
<p class="bas indent2"><span class="nm">1.</span><span class="cl">(Rabah bar Rav Huna, also Tana d'Vei R. Yishmael):</span> A son may not be appointed to lash or curse his father, unless his father was a Mesis, about which it says "v'Lo Sachmol v'Lo Sechaseh Alav."</p>
<p class="bas indent1"><span class="nm">(t)</span><span class="cl">Answer:</span> Beraisa #1 means that the son of the murdered son becomes Go'el ha'Dam (to kill his grandfather). Beraisa #2 means that another son of the father does not become Go'el ha'Dam (to kill his father).</p>
<p class="bas subject"><span class="nm">3)</span>A TREE PARTIALLY IN AN <i>IR</i> <i>MIKLAT</i></p>
<p class="bas indent1"><span class="nm">(a)</span><span class="cl">(Mishnah):</span> If a tree is within the Techum of an Ir Miklat, and the foliage is outside, or vice-versa, the entire tree has the law of the foliage. (If the murderer is on the trunk, it is as if he is on the foliage.)</p>
<p class="bas indent1"><span class="nm">(b)</span><span class="cl">(Gemara - Mishnah #1) Contradiction:</span> (Regarding Ma'aser Sheni) if a tree is within Yerushalayim and the foliage is outside, or vice-versa, any place on the tree is judged like the ground below (e.g. if it is inside the city wall, Ma'aser Sheni may be eaten there, but not redeemed).</p>
<p class="bas indent1"><span class="nm">(c)</span><span class="cl">Answer:</span> You cannot ask from Ma'aser to Arei Miklat. Ma'aser depends on being within the wall, but Arei Miklat depends on dwelling;</p>
<p class="bas indent2"><span class="nm">1.</span>One can dwell in the foliage, but not on the trunk.</p>
<p class="bas indent1"><span class="nm">(d)</span>There is a contradiction regarding Ma'aser itself!</p>
<p class="bas indent2"><span class="nm">1.</span><span class="cl">(Mishnah #2):</span> Regarding (eating or redeeming Ma'aser in) Yerushalayim, we adopt the law of the foliage; regarding Arei Miklat, we adopt the law of the foliage.</p>
<p class="bas indent1"><span class="nm">(e)</span><span class="cl">Answer (Rav Kahana):</span> Mishnah #1 is like Chachamim, Mishnah #2 is like R. Yehudah.</p>
<p class="bas bbbline">12b----------------------------------------12b</p>
<p class="bas indent2"><span class="nm">1.</span><span class="cl">(Beraisa - R. Yehudah):</span> (Regarding Ma'aser), if a cave is partly in Yerushalayim, the entire cave is like the opening. Regarding a tree, we adopt the law of the foliage.</p>
<p class="bas indent1"><span class="nm">(f)</span><span class="cl">Question:</span> Perhaps R. Yehudah adopts the law of the foliage only to be stringent, to forbid redeeming (on the trunk) if the foliage is inside Yerushalayim, and to forbid eating if the foliage is outside;</p>
<p class="bas indent2"><span class="nm">1.</span>Also, if the trunk is outside an Ir Miklat and the foliage is inside, he would be stringent to forbid killing the murderer on the trunk;</p>
<p class="bas indent2"><span class="nm">2.</span>However, if the trunk is inside and the foliage is outside, would he say that since one could kill the murderer if he were on the foliage, he may kill him if he is on the trunk in the Ir Miklat?!</p>
<p class="bas indent1"><span class="nm">(g)</span><span class="cl">Answer (Rava):</span> All agree that he may not kill him on the trunk (in the Ir Miklat);</p>
<p class="bas indent2"><span class="nm">1.</span>If he is on the foliage, all agree that he may kill him by shooting arrows or throwing rocks;</p>
<p class="bas indent2"><span class="nm">2.</span>They argue about whether or not he may climb up the trunk in order to get to the murderer to kill him.</p>
<p class="bas subject"><span class="nm">4)</span>GALUS WITHIN AN <i>IR</i> <i>MIKLAT</i></p>
<p class="bas indent1"><span class="nm">(a)</span><span class="cl">(Mishnah):</span> If a murderer went to Galus and killed in the Ir Miklat, he is exiled to a different neighborhood in the city;</p>
<p class="bas indent1"><span class="nm">(b)</span>If a Levi killed in his city, he is exiled to a different Ir Miklat.</p>
<p class="bas indent1"><span class="nm">(c)</span><span class="cl">(Gemara - Beraisa):</span> "V'Samti <i>Lecha</i> Makom" - in your (Moshe's) lifetime (you will separate Arei Miklat);</p>
<p class="bas indent2"><span class="nm">1.</span>"Makom" - from your place (the Arei Miklat will be the Leviyim's cities).</p>
<p class="bas indent2"><span class="nm">2.</span>"Asher Yanus Shamah" teaches that Galus applied in the Midbar.</p>
<p class="bas indent2"><span class="nm">3.</span><span class="cl">Question:</span> Which place was Kolet?</p>
<p class="bas indent2"><span class="nm">4.</span><span class="cl">Answer:</span> Machaneh Levi was Kolet.</p>
<p class="bas indent2"><span class="nm">5.</span>This is the source that if a Levi killed, he is exiled to a different Ir Miklat. If he exiled himself to a different part of his city, it is Kolet.</p>
<p class="bas indent2"><span class="nm">6.</span><span class="cl">(Rav Acha brei d'Rav Ika):</span> We learn from "Ki <i>v'Ir Miklato</i> Yeshev" - the city that was already Kolet him.</p>
<p class="bas subject"><span class="nm">5)</span>MAY A MURDERER RECEIVE HONOR?</p>
<p class="bas indent1"><span class="nm">(a)</span><span class="cl">(Mishnah):</span> Similarly, if a murderer was exiled to a city, and the people wanted to honor him, he must tell them 'I am a murderer';</p>
<p class="bas indent2"><span class="nm">1.</span>If they still want to honor him, he should let them - "v'Zeh Davar ha'Rotze'ach."</p>
