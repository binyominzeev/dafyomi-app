<p class="bas indent1"><span class="nm">(a)</span><span class="cl">Answer (Mishnah (in the third Perek)):</span> If Reuven swore 'I will not eat this loaf', and again swore 'I will not eat this loaf'' (and he ate it), he is lashed only once (i.e. one set of 39 lashes);</p>
<p class="bas indent2"><span class="nm">1.</span>This is the oath of Bituy for which one is lashed (for Mezid, i.e. he intentionally transgressed) or brings an Oleh v'Yored (for Shogeg, i.e. he forgot).</p>
<p class="bas indent2"><span class="nm">2.</span><span class="cl">Inference:</span> For this oath of Bituy he is lashed (if he was Mezid), but not for 'I will eat' (and he did not eat).</p>
<p class="bas indent1"><span class="nm">(b)</span><span class="cl">Question:</span> The two Stam Mishnayos contradict each other. Why does R. Yochanan rule like this one?</p>
<p class="bas indent2"><span class="nm">1.</span><span class="cl">Counter-question:</span> How do you understand why Rebbi codified Stam Mishnayos that contradict each other?!</p>
<p class="bas indent2"><span class="nm">2.</span><span class="cl">Answer:</span> You must say that originally Rebbi held that one is lashed even for a Lav that does not involve an action, and he taught our Mishnah (that obligates for all four kinds of oaths);</p>
<p class="bas indent3"><span class="nm">i.</span>Later, he retracted, and taught the Mishnah of the third Perek.</p>
<p class="bas indent3"><span class="nm">ii.</span>Since the first Mishnah was already ingrained in the Talmidim, it was left in the Mishnayos.</p>
<p class="bas subject"><span class="nm">2)</span>WHO IS THE TANA OF THE MISHNAH?</p>
<p class="bas indent1"><span class="nm">(a)</span><span class="cl">Question:</span> How can we establish the Mishnah according to R. Yishmael, and it counts the number regarding lashes? Lashes do not apply to appearances of Tzara'as!</p>
<p class="bas indent1"><span class="nm">(b)</span><span class="cl">Answer:</span> Lashes apply to one who cuts off the plagued skin (or a Siman of absolute Tzara'as), according to R. Avin.</p>
<p class="bas indent2"><span class="nm">1.</span><span class="cl">(R. Avin):</span> Whenever the Torah says "Hishamer", "Pen" or "Al", this is a Lav.</p>
<p class="bas indent1"><span class="nm">(c)</span><span class="cl">Question:</span> Lashes do not apply to Shabbos, for desecration of Shabbos is punishable by death (administered by Beis Din);</p>
<p class="bas indent2"><span class="nm">1.</span>One is not lashed for a Lav that is punishable by death.</p>
<p class="bas indent1"><span class="nm">(d)</span><span class="cl">Answer:</span> We established the Mishnah to be R. Yishmael, for he holds that one is lashed for a Lav that is punishable by death.</p>
<p class="bas indent1"><span class="nm">(e)</span><span class="cl">Inference:</span> If not for this, we would have established it to be R. Akiva.</p>
<p class="bas indent1"><span class="nm">(f)</span><span class="cl">Question:</span> We could not establish it to be R. Akiva, for he holds that there are only two Yedi'os of Tum'ah for which one must bring a Korban!</p>
<p class="bas indent1"><span class="nm">(g)</span><span class="cl">Answer:</span> Just like we established it like R. Yishmael, regarding lashes, we can establish it like R. Akiva, regarding lashes!</p>
<p class="bas indent1"><span class="nm">(h)</span><span class="cl">Question:</span> Lashes only apply to an intentional sinner. If so, it should not say 'Yedi'os' of Tum'ah, rather 'warnings'!</p>
<p class="bas indent1"><span class="nm">(i)</span><span class="cl">Answer:</span> The Mishnah means Yedi'os of warnings.</p>
<p class="bas indent1"><span class="nm">(j)</span><span class="cl">Objection #1:</span> Why does it say 'two primary kinds, there are four in all'? Since he sins b'Mezid, there are only two kinds (a Tamei who enters the Mikdash or eats Kodshim)!</p>
<p class="bas indent1"><span class="nm">(k)</span><span class="cl">Objection #2:</span> Why does it say 'if one knew that he became Tamei, and later forgot, and later remembered'? Forgetting is not a factor to obligate someone to be lashed!</p>
<p class="bas indent1"><span class="nm">(l)</span><span class="cl">Objection #3:</span> The Mishnah continues 'he brings an Oleh v'Yored'!</p>
<p class="bas indent1"><span class="nm">(m)</span><span class="cl">Answer #4 (to Question 4:a, (Daf 4b) - Rav Yosef):</span> The Mishnah is Rebbi. Regarding Tum'ah, he teaches according to R. Yishmael. Regarding oaths, he teaches according to R. Akiva.</p>
<p class="bas indent1"><span class="nm">(n)</span><span class="cl">(Rav Kahana):</span> Rebbi did not teach just according to other Tana'im. He himself holds this way!</p>
<p class="bas indent2"><span class="nm">1.</span><span class="cl">(Regarding Tum'ah) - (Beraisa - R. Akiva):</span> "V'Ne'elam... v'Ne'elam" teaches that one brings a Korban only if he knew at the beginning and at the end, and forgot in between (when he transgressed);</p>
<p class="bas bbbline">4b----------------------------------------4b</p>
<p class="bas indent2"><span class="nm">2.</span>Rebbi says, one "v'Ne'elam" and "v'Hu Yada" connotes two times that he knew (at the beginning and at the end);</p>
<p class="bas indent3"><span class="nm">i.</span>The extra "v'Ne'elam" obligates him, whether he forgot the Tum'ah or the Mikdash (or Kodshim). This is like R. Yishmael.</p>
<p class="bas indent2"><span class="nm">3.</span>Regarding oaths, R. Akiva obligates for an oath of the past because he expounds using the method of Ribuy u'Mi'ut (inclusions and exclusions);</p>
<p class="bas indent3"><span class="nm">i.</span>Also Rebbi expounds using the method of Ribuy and Mi'ut. Surely he holds like R. Akiva!</p>
<p class="bas subject"><span class="nm">3)</span>INCLUSIONS AND EXCLUSIONS</p>
<p class="bas indent1"><span class="nm">(a)</span><span class="cl">(Beraisa - Rebbi):</span> One may use anything (worth five Shekalim) to redeem a firstborn son, except for documents;</p>
<p class="bas indent1"><span class="nm">(b)</span>Chachamim say, one may use anything except for slaves, documents and land.</p>
<p class="bas indent2"><span class="nm">1.</span>Rebbi expounds Ribuy and Mi'ut. "U'Fduyav mi'Ben Chodesh" is a Ribuy. "Kesef Chameshes Shekalim" is a Mi'ut. "Tifdeh" is another Ribuy;</p>
<p class="bas indent3"><span class="nm">i.</span>From a Ribuy, Mi'ut, Ribuy we include everything except for one thing (that is very different than the Mi'ut), in this case documents.</p>
<p class="bas indent2"><span class="nm">2.</span>Chachamim expound Klal u'Frat (general and specific terms). "U'Fduyav mi'Ben Chodesh" is a Klal. "Kesef Chameshes Shekalim" is a Prat. "Tifdeh" is another Klal;</p>
<p class="bas indent3"><span class="nm">i.</span>From a Klal u'Frat u'Chlal we include things that are similar to the Prat, i.e. Metaltelim that have intrinsic value;</p>
<p class="bas indent3"><span class="nm">ii.</span>This excludes land, slaves (since they are equated to land) and documents (since documents have no intrinsic value).</p>
<p class="bas indent1"><span class="nm">(c)</span><span class="cl">Question (Ravina):</span> Elsewhere Rebbi expounds Klal u'Frat!</p>
<p class="bas indent2"><span class="nm">1.</span><span class="cl">(Beraisa - R. Yosi b'Rebbi Yehudah) Question:</span> The Torah says to bore through the ear of a slave (who does not want to go free) with a "Martze'a (an awl)." What is the source to allow using a sharp wooden tool, a thorn, a needle, a drill, or a writing tool?</p>
<p class="bas indent2"><span class="nm">2.</span><span class="cl">Answer:</span> "V'Lakachta" includes anything that may be taken in the hand.</p>
<p class="bas indent2"><span class="nm">3.</span>Rebbi says, just like an awl is made of metal, also any metal tool may be used.</p>
