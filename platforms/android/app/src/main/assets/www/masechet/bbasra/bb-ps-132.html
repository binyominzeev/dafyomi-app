<p class="bas subject"><span class="nm">1)</span>THE GIFT OF A HEALTHY PERSON</p>
<p class="bas indent1"><span class="nm">(a)</span><span class="cl">Question (Rava):</span> What is the law regarding a healthy person?</p>
<p class="bas indent2"><span class="nm">1.</span>Perhaps only a Shechiv Mera intends that they will honor her, but if he is healthy, they will honor her (in his lifetime) whether or not she is an overseer!</p>
<p class="bas indent2"><span class="nm">2.</span>Or, perhaps he wants them to start showing more honor to her from now!</p>
<p class="bas indent1"><span class="nm">(b)</span><span class="cl">Answer (Beraisa):</span> If a man wrote the Peros of his property to his wife, she collects her entire Kesuvah from the land (i.e. the gift was in addition to her Kesuvah, and not in place of it);</p>
<p class="bas indent2"><span class="nm">1.</span>If he wrote to her a half, a third or quarter of his property, she collects her entire Kesuvah from the rest.</p>
<p class="bas indent2"><span class="nm">2.</span>R. Eliezer says, if he wrote all his property to her, and a creditor presents a loan document (dated before the gift but after the Kesuvah) against him, she tears up the gift document, (and he collects. If later she is widowed or divorced and the husband did not leave property to pay the Kesuvah,) she can collect her Kesuvah from what the creditor took. (This is because her husband intended that the gift take effect only if it benefits her.)</p>
<p class="bas indent2"><span class="nm">3.</span>Chachamim say, through accepting the gift, she forfeited the lien of her Kesuvah on that land (so she cannot take it from the creditor).</p>
<p class="bas indent2"><span class="nm">4.</span>R. Yehudah ha'Nachtom says, a case occurred with my daughter-in-law, and Rabanan ruled like Chachamim.</p>
<p class="bas indent2"><span class="nm">5.</span><span class="cl">Inference:</span> This is because a creditor had a claim against the land. If not, she would acquire the gift.</p>
<p class="bas indent2"><span class="nm">6.</span><span class="cl">Question:</span> What is the case?</p>
<p class="bas indent3"><span class="nm">i.</span>If her husband was Shechiv Mera, we said that he only made her an overseer!</p>
<p class="bas indent2"><span class="nm">7.</span><span class="cl">Answer:</span> He was healthy (this answers Rava's question).</p>
<p class="bas indent1"><span class="nm">(c)</span><span class="cl">Rejection:</span> Really, he was Shechiv Mera. The gift was to his Arusah or ex-wife. (Ravina and Rav Avira agree that she does not acquire.)</p>
<p class="bas indent1"><span class="nm">(d)</span><span class="cl">(Rav Nachman):</span> The Halachah follows Chachamim.</p>
<p class="bas indent1"><span class="nm">(e)</span><span class="cl">Question:</span> Elsewhere, Rav Nachman follows estimation! (He should rule like R. Eliezer, that presumably, he intended only for his wife's benefit.)</p>
<p class="bas indent2"><span class="nm">1.</span><span class="cl">(Beraisa):</span> If Reuven went overseas, and his father heard that Reuven died, and wrote all his property to others, and later Reuven returned, the gift stands;</p>
<p class="bas indent2"><span class="nm">2.</span>R. Shimon ben Menasiya says, the gift is void. Had he known that his son was alive, he would not have given it.</p>
<p class="bas indent2"><span class="nm">3.</span><span class="cl">(Rav Nachman):</span> The Halachah follows R. Shimon ben Menasiya.</p>
<p class="bas indent1"><span class="nm">(f)</span><span class="cl">Answer:</span> Our case is different. She is happy that people hear that her husband wrote her the property, so she pardons the lien of her Kesuvah.</p>
<p class="bas subject"><span class="nm">2)</span>WHEN A WIFE FORFEITS HER LIEN</p>
<p class="bas indent1"><span class="nm">(a)</span><span class="cl">(Mishnah):</span> If Shimon wrote his property to his sons, and gave to his wife any amount of land, she forfeits her (lien on all the land designated to collect her) Kesuvah.</p>
<p class="bas indent1"><span class="nm">(b)</span><span class="cl">Question:</span> Does she really forfeit her lien for any amount of land?!</p>
<p class="bas indent1"><span class="nm">(c)</span><span class="cl">Answer #1 (Rav):</span> The case is, she acquired on behalf of the sons. (This shows that she consents.)</p>
<p class="bas indent1"><span class="nm">(d)</span><span class="cl">Answer #2 (Shmuel):</span> It is even if he gave the property in front of her and she was silent. (This shows her consent.)</p>
<p class="bas indent1"><span class="nm">(e)</span><span class="cl">Answer #3 (R. Yosi b'Rebbi Chanina):</span> The case is, he said 'take this land in place of your Kesuvah' (and she was silent).</p>
<p class="bas bbbline">132b----------------------------------------132b</p>
<p class="bas indent2"><span class="nm">1.</span>(According to all three opinions,) this is a leniency of Kesuvos. (We assume that she forfeits her lien).</p>
<p class="bas indent1"><span class="nm">(f)</span><span class="cl">(Seifa - R. Yosi):</span> If she said that she forfeits the lien, this takes effect even if he did not write any property to her.</p>
<p class="bas indent1"><span class="nm">(g)</span><span class="cl">Question:</span> This implies that the first Tana holds that he must write and she must say that she pardons the lien!</p>
<p class="bas indent2"><span class="nm">1.</span><span class="cl">Suggestion:</span> The entire Mishnah is like R. Yosi.</p>
<p class="bas indent2"><span class="nm">2.</span><span class="cl">Rejection (Beraisa - R. Yehudah):</span> When does this law (of the first Tana) apply? It is only if she was there <i>and</i> accepted to pardon the lien. If only one of these applies, she does not forfeit it.</p>
<p class="bas indent2"><span class="nm">3.</span>This refutes all three Amora'im.</p>
<p class="bas indent1"><span class="nm">(h)</span><span class="cl">Rava (to Rav Nachman):</span> Like which opinion do you hold?</p>
<p class="bas indent1"><span class="nm">(i)</span><span class="cl">(Rav Nachman):</span> I say that if he wrote any amount of land to her, that suffices for her to forfeit her lien (like R. Yosi. Receiving land or accepting suffices.)</p>
<p class="bas indent1"><span class="nm">(j)</span><span class="cl">Question (Rava):</span> What is the law regarding a healthy person?</p>
<p class="bas indent2"><span class="nm">1.</span>Perhaps only regarding a Shechiv Mera, her silence shows that she forfeits her lien, because she knows that he will not acquire any more property;</p>
<p class="bas indent3"><span class="nm">i.</span>But regarding a healthy person, perhaps she is silent because she thinks that he may acquire more property, she does not want to protest until she sees that she must!</p>
<p class="bas indent2"><span class="nm">2.</span>Or, since she knows that now he has no other property from which she can collect, her silence shows that she forfeits her lien?</p>
<p class="bas indent1"><span class="nm">(k)</span>This question is not resolved.</p>
<p class="bas indent1"><span class="nm">(l)</span>A case occurred in which Reuven said 'half to my daughter, half to my daughter, and a third of the Peros to my wife.'</p>
<p class="bas indent2"><span class="nm">1.</span><span class="cl">(Rav Nachman citing Shmuel):</span> Even if he gave to his wife a date tree to eat its fruit (until it dries up), she forfeited her lien.</p>
<p class="bas indent2"><span class="nm">2.</span><span class="cl">(Rav Chisda):</span> Shmuel said that only because he gave to her a Kinyan in the land. Here, he gave only detached Peros!</p>
<p class="bas indent2"><span class="nm">3.</span><span class="cl">(Rav Nachman):</span> If the Peros were detached, surely she did not forfeit her lien.</p>
<p class="bas indent1"><span class="nm">(m)</span>A case occurred in which Reuven said 'a third to my daughter, a third to my daughter, a third to my wife.' One of the daughters died.</p>
<p class="bas indent1"><span class="nm">(n)</span><span class="cl">(Rav Papa):</span> His wife gets only a third (she forfeited her lien on the rest).</p>
<p class="bas indent1"><span class="nm">(o)</span><span class="cl">Rejection (Rav Kahana):</span> She did not forfeit her lien from property her husband will acquire in the future. Here also, he acquired back what he gave to the daughter who died!</p>
