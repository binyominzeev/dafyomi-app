<p class="dedicationbox">NEDARIM 4 (10 Sivan) - Today's study material has been dedicated by Mrs. Rita Grunberger of Queens, N.Y., in loving memory of her husband, Reb Yitzchok Yakov (Irving) ben Eliyahu Grunberger. Irving Grunberger helped many people quietly in an unassuming manner and is dearly missed by all who knew him. His Yahrzeit is 10 Sivan.<br>12TH CYCLE DEDICATION<br>NEDARIM 2-5 - Two weeks of study material have been dedicated by Mrs. Estanne Abraham Fawer to honor the eighth Yahrzeit of her father, Rav Mordechai ben Eliezer Zvi (Rabbi Morton Weiner) Z'L, who passed away on 18 Teves 5760. May the merit of supporting and advancing Dafyomi study -- which was so important to him -- during the weeks of his Yahrzeit serve as an Iluy for his Neshamah. </p>

<p class="bas subject"><span class="nm">1)</span>BAL TE'ACHER FOR NEZIRUS</p>
<p class="bas indent1"><span class="nm">(a)</span><span class="cl">Answer #3 (Rav Acha bar Yakov):</span> Bal Te'acher applies when he accepted Nezirus in a cemetery.</p>
<p class="bas indent1"><span class="nm">(b)</span><span class="cl">Question #1:</span> This is like the opinion that Nezirus does not take effect immediately in such a case;</p>
<p class="bas indent2"><span class="nm">1.</span>According to the opinion that Nezirus takes effect immediately, Bal Te'acher does not apply!</p>
<p class="bas indent1"><span class="nm">(c)</span><span class="cl">Question #2:</span> Mar bar Rav Ashi taught that all agree that it takes effect immediately, and they argue only about whether or not he is lashed (if he eats grapes before leaving the cemetery)!</p>
<p class="bas indent1"><span class="nm">(d)</span><span class="cl">Answer (to both questions):</span> He transgresses Bal Te'acher for delaying Nezirus in Taharah.</p>
<p class="bas indent1"><span class="nm">(e)</span><span class="cl">Inference (and Answer #4 - Rav Ashi):</span> This shows that if a Nazir intentionally makes himself Tamei, he transgresses Bal Te'acher of Nezirus Taharah.</p>
<p class="bas indent1"><span class="nm">(f)</span><span class="cl">Answer #5 (R. Acha brei d'Rav Ika):</span> Bal Te'acher applies to shaving (at the end of Nezirus).</p>
<p class="bas indent2"><span class="nm">1.</span>This is not only according to the opinion that it is Me'akev (the permission to drink wine). Even according to the opinion that it is not Me'akev, it is a Mitzvah, and he delays it!</p>
<p class="bas indent1"><span class="nm">(g)</span><span class="cl">Answer #6 (Mar Zutra brei d'Rav Mari):</span> Bal Te'acher applies to bringing Korbanos Nezirus.</p>
<p class="bas indent1"><span class="nm">(h)</span><span class="cl">Question:</span> We don't need the Hekesh for this. Bal Te'acher applies to all Korbanos!</p>
<p class="bas indent1"><span class="nm">(i)</span><span class="cl">Answer:</span> One might have thought that Bal Te'acher does not apply to Nezirus, for it is a Chidush (special law).</p>
<p class="bas indent1"><span class="nm">(j)</span><span class="cl">Question:</span> What is the Chidush?</p>
<p class="bas indent2"><span class="nm">1.</span><span class="cl">Suggestion:</span> One cannot be Makdish (an animal to be) a Chatas Nazir (unless he is a Nazir).</p>
<p class="bas indent2"><span class="nm">2.</span><span class="cl">Rejection:</span> Bal Te'acher applies to Chatas (for any Kares, e.g. eating) Chelev, even though he cannot be Makdish a Chatas Chelev (unless he ate Chelev)!</p>
<p class="bas indent1"><span class="nm">(k)</span><span class="cl">Answer #1:</span> The Chidush is that one becomes a full Nazir even if he vowed only to be a Nazir (abstain) from grape skins.</p>
<p class="bas indent1"><span class="nm">(l)</span><span class="cl">Question #1:</span> This is like the opinion that one becomes a full Nazir in such a case;</p>
<p class="bas indent2"><span class="nm">1.</span>According to R. Shimon, who says that one becomes a Nazir only if he vows from all the Isurim, how can we answer?</p>
<p class="bas indent1"><span class="nm">(m)</span><span class="cl">Question #2:</span> That Chidush is a stringency! (All the more so Bal Te'acher should apply to Korbanos Nezirus!)</p>
<p class="bas bbbline">4b----------------------------------------4b</p>
<p class="bas indent1"><span class="nm">(n)</span><span class="cl">Answer #2:</span> The Chidush is that if he shaved after bringing only one of the three Korbanos, he is permitted (to drink wine).</p>
<p class="bas indent1"><span class="nm">(o)</span><span class="cl">Answer #3:</span> The Chidush is (like we suggested above) that one cannot be Matfis a Chatas Nazir.</p>
<p class="bas indent2"><span class="nm">1.</span><span class="cl">Question:</span> We asked that this is no Chidush, for Bal Te'acher applies to Chatas Chelev, even though he cannot be Matfis it!</p>
<p class="bas indent2"><span class="nm">2.</span><span class="cl">Answer:</span> Chatas Chelev is for atonement (therefore Bal Te'acher applies), but Chatas Nazir is not.</p>
<p class="bas indent2"><span class="nm">3.</span><span class="cl">Question:</span> Chatas Yoledes is not for atonement, yet Bal Te'acher applies to it!</p>
<p class="bas indent2"><span class="nm">4.</span><span class="cl">Answer:</span> Chatas Yoledes permits her to eat Kodshim (therefore Bal Te'acher applies to it).</p>
<p class="bas subject"><span class="nm">2)</span>THE SOURCE FOR <i>HAFARAH</i></p>
<p class="bas indent1"><span class="nm">(a)</span><span class="cl">(Beraisa (3a)):</span> Just like a father or husband can annul the Nedarim of his daughter or wife, he can annul her Nezirus.</p>
<p class="bas indent1"><span class="nm">(b)</span><span class="cl">Question:</span> Why do we need to learn this from a Hekesh? We should be able to learn from a Mah Matzinu (precedent)!</p>
<p class="bas indent1"><span class="nm">(c)</span><span class="cl">Answer:</span> One might have thought that he can annul Nedarim, for (Stam, i.e. unspecified) Nedarim are permanent, but he cannot annul Nezirus, for (Stam) Nezirus is only for 30 days.</p>
<p class="bas subject"><span class="nm">3)</span>THE FULL TEXT OF THE VOWS IN THE <i>MISHNAH</i></p>
<p class="bas indent1"><span class="nm">(a)</span><span class="cl">(Mishnah):</span> If one said 'I am Mudar from you', ('I am separated from you', or 'I am distanced from you'...)</p>
<p class="bas indent1"><span class="nm">(b)</span><span class="cl">(Shmuel):</span> In every case he is forbidden only if he also said 'that I will eat (or taste) from you.'</p>
<p class="bas indent1"><span class="nm">(c)</span><span class="cl">Question (Beraisa #1):</span> If one said 'I am Mudar from you', 'I am separated from you', or 'I am distanced from you', he is forbidden. If he said 'that I will eat from you' or 'that I will taste from you', he is forbidden. (We cannot say that the first three vows require one of the latter two expressions, for each of the latter two works by itself!)</p>
<p class="bas indent1"><span class="nm">(d)</span><span class="cl">Answer:</span> The Beraisa means that the first vows take effect only if he added one of the latter expressions.</p>
<p class="bas indent1"><span class="nm">(e)</span><span class="cl">Question (Beraisa #2):</span> If one said 'that I will eat from you' or 'that I will taste from you', he is forbidden. If he said 'I am Mudar from you', 'I am separated from you', or 'I am distanced from you', he is forbidden.</p>
<p class="bas indent1"><span class="nm">(f)</span><span class="cl">Answer:</span> Beraisa #2 means that the first vows take effect only if he previously said one of the latter expressions.</p>
<p class="bas indent1"><span class="nm">(g)</span><span class="cl">Objection #1:</span> If so, this teaches exactly like Beraisa #1! (Why was it taught differently?)</p>
<p class="bas indent1"><span class="nm">(h)</span><span class="cl">Objection #2:</span> Why does it say 'he is forbidden' twice?</p>
