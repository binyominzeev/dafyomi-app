<div class="subject"><span class="nm">1)</span><p>MARCHESHES AND MACHAVAS</p></div>
<div class="indent1"><span class="nm">(a)</span><p><span class="cl">(Mishnah):</span> One who says 'Alai b'Machavas (it is incumbent on me to bring a Minchah cooked) in a Machavas may not bring in a Marcheshes, and vice-versa.</p></div>
<div class="indent1"><span class="nm">(b)</span><p><span class="cl">Question:</span> What is the difference between Machavas and Marcheshes?</p></div>
<div class="indent1"><span class="nm">(c)</span><p><span class="cl">Answer #1 (R. Yosi):</span> A Marcheshes has a cover, a Machavas does not.</p></div>
<div class="indent1"><span class="nm">(d)</span><p><span class="cl">Answer #2 (R. Chanina ben Gamliel):</span> A Marcheshes is deep. Bread cooked in it is springy (some texts - and soft). A Machavas is flat. Bread cooked on it is hard.</p></div>
<div class="indent1"><span class="nm">(e)</span><p><span class="cl">(Gemara) Question:</span> What is R. Yosi's reason?</p></div>
<div class="indent2"><span class="nm">1.</span><p><span class="cl">Suggestion:</span> He learns from "Rachash Libi Davar Tov." 'Marcheshes' is brought (to atone) for 'Rechushei ha'Lev', i.e. hidden (sinful) thoughts in the heart;</p></div>
<div class="indent3"><span class="nm">i.</span><p>'Machavas' is brought for 'Machbu'ei ha'Peh' (such as gossip, which is open), like people say 'Menave'ach Nevuchei'.</p></div>
<div class="indent2"><span class="nm">2.</span><p><span class="cl">Rejection:</span> We could learn oppositely! "Lamah Nachbeisa Livro'ach" teaches that Machavas is for Machbo'ei (hidden matters of) the heart;</p></div>
<div class="indent3"><span class="nm">i.</span><p>Marcheshes is for Rechushei (moving, i.e. of the lips), like people say 'Merachashan Sifsosei';</p></div>
<div class="indent1"><span class="nm">(f)</span><p><span class="cl">Answer:</span> He has a tradition from Sinai.</p></div>
<div class="indent1"><span class="nm">(g)</span><p><span class="cl">(Mishnah - R. Chanina ben Gamliel):</span> A Marcheshes...</p></div>
<div class="indent1"><span class="nm">(h)</span><p>He learns that a Marcheshes is deep from "v'Chol Na'asah va'Marcheshes" (implying that the bread is inside);</p></div>
<div class="indent2"><span class="nm">1.</span><p>He learns that a Machavas is flat from "v'Al Machavas." (The bread is on top, for the Kli has no interior.)</p></div>
<div class="indent1"><span class="nm">(i)</span><p><span class="cl">(Beraisa - Beis Shamai):</span> One who says 'Alai Marcheshes' should not fulfill his vow until Eliyahu will come (and resolve our doubt);</p></div>
<div class="indent2"><span class="nm">1.</span><p>We do not know if Marcheshes is the name of the pot (if so, he vowed to donate a pot to Hekdesh), or if it describes the consistency of the Minchah (and he vowed to bring a Minchah).</p></div>
<div class="indent1"><span class="nm">(j)</span><p>Beis Hillel say, it is the name of a pot;</p></div>
<div class="indent2"><span class="nm">1.</span><p>It was like a deep pan with craters in which the dough would get cooked;</p></div>
<div class="indent2"><span class="nm">2.</span><p>When the dough was inside, it looked like acorns.</p></div>
<div class="indent1"><span class="nm">(k)</span><p>Since it says "va'Marcheshes" and "v'Al Machavas" (the verse changes from 'in' to 'on'), this shows that these are names of Kelim.</p></div>
<div class="subject"><span class="nm">2)</span><p>THE MINCHAH MA'AFEH TANUR</p></div>
<div class="indent1"><span class="nm">(a)</span><p><span class="cl">(Mishnah):</span> If one said 'Alai (to bring a Minchah baked) in a Tanur', he may not bring a Minchah baked in a Kupach (a small oven with room for one pot on top), on tiles or in pots of Aravim;</p></div>
<div class="indent1"><span class="nm">(b)</span><p>R. Yehudah says, he may bring a Minchah baked in a Kupach.</p></div>
<div class="indent1"><span class="nm">(c)</span><p>If one said 'Alai Minchas Ma'afeh (a Minchah baked in a Tanur)', he may not bring half Chalos and half Rekikim (rather, he must bring the whole Minchah from one of them);</p></div>
<div class="indent1"><span class="nm">(d)</span><p>R. Shimon permits this, for they are the same species of Minchah.</p></div>
<div class="indent1"><span class="nm">(e)</span><p><span class="cl">(Gemara - Beraisa):</span> (One may bring) "Ma'afeh Tanur", but not something cooked in a Kupach, on tiles or in pots of Aravim;</p></div>
<div class="indent1"><span class="nm">(f)</span><p>R. Yehudah says, it says "Tanur" twice to be Machshir a Minchah baked in a Kupach;</p></div>
<div class="indent1"><span class="nm">(g)</span><p>R. Shimon says, it says "Tanur" twice. One teaches that they are baked in a Tanur. The other teaches that Hekdeshan b'Tanur. (The oven is Mekadesh them.)</p></div>
<div class="indent1"><span class="nm">(h)</span><p><span class="cl">Question:</span> Does R. Shimon really hold that the Tanur is Mekadesh Menachos?! (Tosfos - there is only one Tanur in the Mikdash for all Menachos.)</p></div>
<div class="indent2"><span class="nm">1.</span><p><span class="cl">(Mishnah - R. Shimon):</span> Shtei ha'Lechem and Lechem ha'Panim may be baked in the Azarah, or in Beis Pagi (outside the Azarah. Opinions differ about how this shows that R. Shimon cannot hold that the oven is Mekadesh. Rashi - if so, the Lechem would be Nifsal due to Yotzei. Tosfos (9a) - if so, it would be a disgrace for the Lechem to be outside. Rambam (according to R. Akiva Eiger) - the Lechem would be Nifsal due to Linah (R. Shimon holds that Shtei ha'Lechem are not Docheh Yom Tov, so they must be baked before Yom Tov.) R. Gershom - Klei Shares are not Mekadesh outside, the bread would not become Kodesh.</p></div>
<div class="indent1"><span class="nm">(i)</span><p><span class="cl">Answer (Rava):</span> 'Hekdeshan b'Tanur' means that one must be Mekadesh the flour with intent to bake it in a Tanur.</p></div>
<div class="indent1"><span class="nm">(j)</span><p><span class="cl">(Mishnah):</span> If one said 'Alai Minchas Ma'afe', he may not bring half...</p></div>
<div class="indent1"><span class="nm">(k)</span><p><span class="cl">(Beraisa):</span> "V'Chi Sakriv" connotes when you want to offer. (Ma'afeh Tanur is optional);</p></div>
<div class="indent2"><span class="nm">1.</span><p><span class="cl">Question (R. Yehudah):</span> What is the source that if one said 'Alai Minchas Ma'afe', he may not bring half Chalos and half Rekikim?</p></div>
<div class="indent2"><span class="nm">2.</span><p><span class="cl">Answer #1 (R. Yehudah):</span> "Korban Minchah" - it must be one Korban, and not two or three.</p></div>
<div class="indent2"><span class="nm">3.</span><p><span class="cl">R. Shimon:</span> If it said "Korban" regarding each of them twice, we would expound that way. However, it says "Korban" only once, and it says Chalos and Rekikim</p></div>
<div class="bbbline">63b----------------------------------------63b</p></div>
<div class="indent3"><span class="nm">i.</span><p>This teaches that one may bring (only) Chalos, (only) Rekikim; or, half (really, some) of the 10 loaves Chalos, and the rest Rekikim;</p></div>
<div class="indent3"><span class="nm">ii.</span><p>When bringing some of each, they are crumbled up and kneaded together with oil. A Kometz is taken from the mixture, if the entire Kometz was from one of them it is valid.</p></div>
<div class="indent2"><span class="nm">4.</span><p><span class="cl">Answer #2 (R. Yosi b'Rebbi Yehudah):</span> "V'Chol Minchah Asher Te'afeh ba'Tanur v'Chol Na'asah va'Marcheshes v'Al Machavas...;V'Chol Minchah Velulah va'Shemen va'Charevah" - just like Marcheshes and Machavas (also Belulah and Charevah) are two distinct types of Menachos that may not be offered together, also what is mentioned beforehand (Ma'afeh Tanur, i.e. Chalos and Rekikim.)</p></div>
<div class="indent1"><span class="nm">(l)</span><p><span class="cl">Question:</span> R. Shimon's objection is strong! (How does R. Yehudah answer it?)</p></div>
<div class="indent1"><span class="nm">(m)</span><p><span class="cl">Answer:</span> R. Yehudah holds that since it says "Shemen" with each of them, it is as if it says Korban with each of them.</p></div>
<div class="indent2"><span class="nm">1.</span><p>R. Shimon argues. Had it said Shemen only once, one might have thought that Ma'afeh Tanur must be brought half Chalos and half Rekikim.</p></div>
<div class="indent2"><span class="nm">2.</span><p>Rather, it repeats "Shemen" (to interrupt, and thereby) teach that (alternatively,) either of them may be brought by itself.</p></div>
<div class="indent1"><span class="nm">(n)</span><p><span class="cl">Question:</span> What do R. Yehudah and R. Yosi b'Rebbi Yehudah argue about?</p></div>
<div class="indent1"><span class="nm">(o)</span><p><span class="cl">Answer:</span> They argue about b'Di'eved. (R. Yehudah is Machshir if both were brought together, and R. Yosi is Posel.)</p></div>

<div class="subject"><span class="nm">3)</span><p>REAPING THE OMER</p></div>
<div class="indent1"><span class="nm">(a)</span><p><span class="cl">(Mishnah - R. Yishmael):</span> If the day of the Omer (Nisan 16) is Shabbos, the Isaron is sifted from three Sa'im (of barley). On a weekday, it is sifted from five Sa'im.</p></div>
<div class="indent1"><span class="nm">(b)</span><p>Chachamim say, whether or not it is Shabbos, it is sifted from three Sa'im.</p></div>
<div class="indent1"><span class="nm">(c)</span><p>(The barley is reaped the previous night.) R. Chanina Segan ha'Kohanim says, on Shabbos one person reaps it using one sickle and one box. On a weekday three people reap it. Each uses his own sickle and his own box;</p></div>
<div class="indent1"><span class="nm">(d)</span><p>Chachamim say, whether or not it is Shabbos, three people reap it, each with his own sickle and box.</p></div>
<div class="indent1"><span class="nm">(e)</span><p><span class="cl">(Gemara) Question:</span> Granted, Chachamim hold that a choice Isaron is sifted from three Sa'im, whether or not it is Shabbos;</p></div>
<div class="indent2"><span class="nm">1.</span><p>What is R. Yishmael's opinion?</p></div>
<div class="indent3"><span class="nm">i.</span><p>If he holds that a choice Isaron comes from five Sa'im, this should be done even on Shabbos. If it comes from three Sa'im, this should be done even on a weekday!</p></div>
<div class="indent1"><span class="nm">(f)</span><p><span class="cl">Answer (Rava):</span> He holds that a choice Isaron is easily sifted from five Sa'im, but one must sift many times to get a choice Isaron from three Sa'im;</p></div>
<div class="indent2"><span class="nm">1.</span><p>On a weekday, it is better to sift it from five. (Rashi - the entire Isaron will be very fine flour; Rashash - Hekdesh should not resemble a poor person who sifts many times to get as much as possible from a small amount);</p></div>
<div class="indent2"><span class="nm">2.</span><p>On Shabbos (it is sifted from three, for) it is better to do more than is needed of one Melachah, (sifting) than to do more than is needed of many Melachos (to reap, winnow, select, grind and sift an extra two Sa'im).</p></div>
<div class="indent1"><span class="nm">(g)</span><p><span class="cl">(Rabah):</span> R. Yishmael and R. Yishmael the son of R. Yochanan ben Brokah agree with each other:</p></div>
<div class="indent2"><span class="nm">1.</span><p><span class="cl">(Beraisa - R. Yishmael, son of R. Yochanan ben Brokah):</span> If Erev Pesach is on Shabbos, the Korban Pesach is flayed until the chest (on Shabbos). The rest is flayed at night;</p></div>
<div class="indent2"><span class="nm">2.</span><p>Chachamim say, it is flayed entirely on Shabbos.</p></div>
<div class="indent2"><span class="nm">3.</span><p>For the sake of the Omer, R. Yishmael allows a minimal exertion on Shabbos. Likewise, he would minimize exertion on Shabbos to flay Korban Pesach.</p></div>
