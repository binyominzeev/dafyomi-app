<p class="bas subject"><span class="nm">1)</span>HOW MANY PEOPLE MUST ATTEND A FUNERAL</p>
<p class="bas indent1"><span class="nm">(a)</span><span class="cl">(Beraisa):</span> We stop learning Torah to accompany a Mes or a bride. R. Yehudah bar Ilai would do so.</p>
<p class="bas indent1"><span class="nm">(b)</span>This does not apply if enough people already accompany him.</p>
<p class="bas indent1"><span class="nm">(c)</span><span class="cl">Question:</span> What is the proper amount?</p>
<p class="bas indent1"><span class="nm">(d)</span><span class="cl">Answer #1 (Rav Shmuel bar Inya):</span> We need 12,000 men and 6,000 Shofar blowers. Some say that the 6,000 are included in the 12,000.</p>
<p class="bas indent1"><span class="nm">(e)</span><span class="cl">Answer #2 (Ula):</span> We need enough to make a wall from the city to the cemetery.</p>
<p class="bas indent1"><span class="nm">(f)</span><span class="cl">Answer #3 (Rav Sheshes):</span> The taking of Torah should be like Matan Torah, in front of 600,000.</p>
<p class="bas indent2"><span class="nm">1.</span>This applies to one who learned. There is no limit to the proper amount for one who taught.</p>
<p class="bas subject"><span class="nm">2)</span>BATEI KENESIYOS IN BAVEL</p>
<p class="bas indent1"><span class="nm">(a)</span><span class="cl">(Beraisa - R. Shimon):</span> Yisrael is so dear to Hash-m that wherever we are exiled, the Shechinah accompanies us:</p>
<p class="bas indent2"><span class="nm">1.</span>In Mitzrayim - "I was revealed to your father's house in Mitzrayim";</p>
<p class="bas indent2"><span class="nm">2.</span>In Bavel - "For your sake I was sent to Bavel."</p>
<p class="bas indent1"><span class="nm">(b)</span>Hash-m will return with us in the future redemption. It says "Hash-m <i>Yashuv</i> (will return with) your captivity", not 'Heshiv (He will return us)'.</p>
<p class="bas indent1"><span class="nm">(c)</span><span class="cl">Question:</span> Where in Bavel is the Shechinah?</p>
<p class="bas indent1"><span class="nm">(d)</span><span class="cl">Answer (Abaye):</span> It alternates between the Batei Kenesiyos of Hutzal and Shaf v'Yatziv.</p>
<p class="bas indent2"><span class="nm">1.</span><span class="cl">Abaye:</span> When I am within a Parsah (a 72 minute walk), I go to pray there.</p>
<p class="bas indent1"><span class="nm">(e)</span>Shmuel's father and Levi were in the Beis ha'Keneses of Shaf v'Yatziv in Nehardai. The Shechinah came. They heard a noise and left.</p>
<p class="bas indent1"><span class="nm">(f)</span>A similar episode occurred to Rav Sheshes (who was blind); he did not leave. Angels came and frightened him.</p>
<p class="bas indent2"><span class="nm">1.</span><span class="cl">Rav Sheshes (to Hash-m):</span> Who should be pushed aside, one who is shamed (me), or one who is not shamed?</p>
<p class="bas indent2"><span class="nm">2.</span>Hash-m told the angels to leave him.</p>
<p class="bas indent1"><span class="nm">(g)</span><span class="cl">(R. Yitzchak):</span> "I will be to them a small Mikdash" refers to Batei Kenesiyos and Batei Medrashos in Bavel;</p>
<p class="bas indent1"><span class="nm">(h)</span><span class="cl">(R. Elazar):</span> It refers to Rav's house in Bavel.</p>
<p class="bas indent1"><span class="nm">(i)</span><span class="cl">(Rava):</span> "Hash-m, You were a dwelling place for us" refers to Batei Kenesiyos and Batei Medrashos in Bavel.</p>
<p class="bas indent1"><span class="nm">(j)</span><span class="cl">(Abaye):</span> I used to learn at home and pray in a Beis ha'Keneses. After I was struck by David's words, "Hash-m, I love Your dwelling" I also learn in a Beis ha'Keneses.</p>
<p class="bas indent1"><span class="nm">(k)</span><span class="cl">(Beraisa - R. Eliezer ha'Kapar):</span> In the future, Batei Kenesiyos and Batei Medrashos of Bavel will be fixed in Eretz Yisrael;</p>
<p class="bas indent2"><span class="nm">1.</span>We learn from "Like Tavor among the mountains and Karmel on the sea will come". These mountains came once to learn (at the time of Matan) Torah, and they were fixed in Eretz Yisrael. People learn and spread Torah in Batei Kenesiyos and Batei Medrashos of Bavel, all the more so they will be fixed in Eretz Yisrael!</p>
<p class="bas indent1"><span class="nm">(l)</span><span class="cl">(Bar Kapara):</span> "Lamah Teratzdun Harim Gavnunim" - a Bas Kol told the other mountains 'why Tirtzu Din (do you want a judgment) with Har Sinai' (to see on which Torah should be given)? You are blemished compared to Sinai (which is the lowest)!</p>
<p class="bas indent2"><span class="nm">1.</span>"Gavnunim" is like "Giben" (a Mum),</p>
<p class="bas indent2"><span class="nm">2.</span><span class="cl">(Rav Ashi):</span> This shows that haughtiness is a Mum.</p>
<p class="bas indent1"><span class="nm">(m)</span><span class="cl">(Mishnah):</span> We do not use a Beis ha'Keneses for a shortcut.</p>
<p class="bas indent1"><span class="nm">(n)</span><span class="cl">(R. Avahu):</span> If there used to be a path there, it is permitted.</p>
<p class="bas indent1"><span class="nm">(o)</span><span class="cl">(Rav Nachman bar Yitzchak):</span> If one entered for a different reason, he may make it a shortcut.</p>
<p class="bas indent1"><span class="nm">(p)</span><span class="cl">(R. Chelbo):</span> If one entered to pray, he may make it a shortcut;</p>
<p class="bas indent2"><span class="nm">1.</span>We learn from "One who enters (the Mikdash) in the north to bow will leave in the south."</p>
<p class="bas indent1"><span class="nm">(q)</span><span class="cl">(Mishnah):</span> If weeds grow we do not cut them, to cause grief.</p>
<p class="bas indent1"><span class="nm">(r)</span><span class="cl">Contradiction (Beraisa):</span> We may not cut them and feed them (to animals), but we may cut them and leave them!</p>
<p class="bas indent1"><span class="nm">(s)</span><span class="cl">Answer:</span> Also the Mishnah forbids only cutting them to feed them.</p>
<p class="bas indent1"><span class="nm">(t)</span><span class="cl">(Beraisa):</span> We do not act frivolously in a cemetery:</p>
<p class="bas indent2"><span class="nm">1.</span>We do not graze animals there, or route an irrigation ditch through it. We do not gather weeds in it; if one gathered, they are burned there, for the honor of the deceased.</p>
<p class="bas indent2"><span class="nm">2.</span><span class="cl">Question:</span> What is 'for the honor of the deceased'?</p>
<p class="bas indent3"><span class="nm">i.</span>It cannot be burning the weeds, for this does not honor them!</p>
<p class="bas indent2"><span class="nm">3.</span><span class="cl">Answer:</span> It refers to the Reisha, we do not act frivolously there.</p>
<p class="bas subject"><span class="nm">3)</span>WHEN WE READ <i>PARSHAS SHEKALIM</i></p>
<p class="bas indent1"><span class="nm">(a)</span><span class="cl">(Mishnah):</span> When Rosh Chodesh Adar falls on Shabbos, we read Parshas Shekalim. If it falls during the week, we read it the previous Shabbos, and the next Shabbos has no special Parshah.</p>
<p class="bas indent1"><span class="nm">(b)</span>The second, third and fourth Shabbosos we read Parshiyos Zachor, Parah Adumah and ha'Chodesh. The fifth Shabbos we resume the normal order.</p>
<p class="bas indent1"><span class="nm">(c)</span>We interrupt (the normal order) for all of the following - Rosh Chodesh, Chanukah, Purim, Ta'aneisim, Ma'amados, and Yom Kipur.</p>
<p class="bas indent1"><span class="nm">(d)</span><span class="cl">(Gemara - Mishnah):</span> We announce about Shekalim and Kil'ayim on Rosh Chodesh Adar.</p>
<p class="bas bbbline">29b----------------------------------------29b</p>
<p class="bas indent1"><span class="nm">(e)</span><span class="cl">Question:</span> We understand regarding Kil'ayim, for this is when it sprouts;</p>
<p class="bas indent2"><span class="nm">1.</span>Why is this the time to announce about Shekalim?</p>
<p class="bas indent1"><span class="nm">(f)</span><span class="cl">Answer (R. Tavi):</span> "Zos Olas Chodesh b'Chodsho" - bring Korbanos from new money. (A Gezeirah Shavah teaches that this refers to Nisan.)</p>
<p class="bas indent2"><span class="nm">1.</span>Since new money is needed for Nisan, we read the Parshah on the first of Adar.</p>
<p class="bas indent1"><span class="nm">(g)</span><span class="cl">Suggestion:</span> These Mishnayos are unlike R. Shimon ben Gamliel:</p>
<p class="bas indent2"><span class="nm">1.</span><span class="cl">(Beraisa):</span> We begin learning Hilchos Pesach 30 days before Pesach;</p>
<p class="bas indent2"><span class="nm">2.</span>R. Shimon ben Gamliel says, we begin two weeks before.</p>
<p class="bas indent1"><span class="nm">(h)</span><span class="cl">Rejection:</span> They can even be like R. Shimon ben Gamliel. (Moneychangers') tables are set up on the 15th outside the Mikdash, and on the 25th in the Mikdash (to enable people to give half-Shekalim). We read two weeks before the tables are set up.</p>
<p class="bas subject"><span class="nm">4)</span>WHAT IS PARSHAS SHEKALIM?</p>
<p class="bas indent1"><span class="nm">(a)</span><span class="cl">Question:</span> What is Parshas Shekalim?</p>
<p class="bas indent1"><span class="nm">(b)</span><span class="cl">Answer #1 (Rav):</span> It is "Tzav... (the Tamid offering)";</p>
<p class="bas indent1"><span class="nm">(c)</span><span class="cl">Answer #2 (Shmuel):</span> It is "Ki Sisa (the Mitzvah to give half-Shekelim)."</p>
<p class="bas indent1"><span class="nm">(d)</span><span class="cl">Question:</span> According to Rav, why is it called Parshas Shekalim?</p>
<p class="bas indent1"><span class="nm">(e)</span><span class="cl">Answer:</span> This is like R. Tavi taught ("Zos Olas Chodesh b'Chodsho" is in Parshas "Tzav... ").</p>
<p class="bas indent1"><span class="nm">(f)</span><span class="cl">Question:</span> According to Rav, we understand why we read "Tzav", for it alludes to (bringing Shekalim for) Korbanos; like R. Tavi taught.</p>
<p class="bas indent2"><span class="nm">1.</span>According to Shmuel, how does Parshas Shekalim relate to (Shekalim for) Korbanos? "Ki Sisa" discusses Shekalim given for the Adanim (sockets of the Mishkan) not for the Korbanos themselves)!</p>
<p class="bas indent1"><span class="nm">(g)</span><span class="cl">Answer:</span> This is like a Beraisa that Rav Yosef taught. Three collections were made. One was for Korbanos, one for the Adanim, and one for Bedek ha'Bayis.</p>
<p class="bas indent1"><span class="nm">(h)</span>According to Rav, why does the Mishnah mention Rosh Chodesh Adar on Shabbos? Whenever Rosh Chodesh falls on Shabbos, we read Tzav!</p>
<p class="bas indent1"><span class="nm">(i)</span><span class="cl">Answer:</span> On another Shabbos Rosh Chodesh, six read from the weekly Parshah and one in Tzav. On Rosh Chodesh Adar, all read in Tzav.</p>
<p class="bas indent1"><span class="nm">(j)</span><span class="cl">Question:</span> This is like the opinion that we interrupt from reading the usual weekly Parshah;</p>
<p class="bas indent2"><span class="nm">1.</span>How can we answer for the opinion that we read the weekly Parshah and a special Haftorah?</p>
<p class="bas indent1"><span class="nm">(k)</span><span class="cl">Answer:</span> This Rosh Chodesh, three read from the weekly Parshah and four read from Tzav.</p>
<p class="bas indent1"><span class="nm">(l)</span><span class="cl">Question (Beraisa):</span> When Rosh Chodesh Adar is on Shabbos, we read Parshas Shekalim, and Yehoyada ha'Kohen for the Haftorah.</p>
<p class="bas indent2"><span class="nm">1.</span>The Haftorah discusses "Kesef Nafshos Erko" - this is like Ki Sisa (which discusses "Kofer Nafsho");</p>
<p class="bas indent2"><span class="nm">2.</span>However, if Parshas Shekalim is Tzav, how does the Haftorah relate to it?</p>
<p class="bas indent1"><span class="nm">(m)</span><span class="cl">Answer:</span> This is like R. Tavi (Tzav alludes to bringing Shekalim for Korbanos).</p>
<p class="bas indent1"><span class="nm">(n)</span><span class="cl">Question (Beraisa):</span> If Rosh Chodesh Adar is in the week before or after (we normally read) Parshas Shekalim, we read it and repeat it.</p>
<p class="bas indent2"><span class="nm">1.</span>We read Ki Sisa about this time, but Tzav is read much later!</p>
<p class="bas indent1"><span class="nm">(o)</span><span class="cl">Answer:</span> The Beraisa discusses Eretz Yisrael, where they read the Torah over the course of three years (they reach Tzav in Adar of the third year).</p>
<p class="bas indent1"><span class="nm">(p)</span><span class="cl">Support (for Shmuel - Beraisa):</span> When Rosh Chodesh Adar falls on Shabbos, we read Ki Sisa. The Haftorah is Yehoyada ha'Kohen.</p>
<p class="bas subject"><span class="nm">5)</span>THE <i>KRI'AH</i> FOR ROSH CHODESH TEVES</p>
<p class="bas indent1"><span class="nm">(a)</span><span class="cl">(R. Yitzchak Nafcha):</span> When Rosh Chodesh Adar falls on Shabbos, we take out three Sefrei Torah, in which we read the weekly Parshah, Musaf of Rosh Chodesh, and Parshas Shekalim;</p>
<p class="bas indent1"><span class="nm">(b)</span>When Rosh Chodesh Teves falls on Shabbos, we take out three Sefrei Torah, in which we read the weekly Parshah, Musaf Rosh Chodesh; and Chanukas ha'Mizbe'ach.</p>
<p class="bas indent1"><span class="nm">(c)</span>He needed to say both teachings:</p>
<p class="bas indent2"><span class="nm">1.</span>Had he only taught the latter, one might have thought that the Halachah follows Rav, and only two Sefrei Torah are needed when Rosh Chodesh Adar is on Shabbos since the reading for Rosh Chodesh is in Tzav).</p>
<p class="bas indent1"><span class="nm">(d)</span><span class="cl">Question:</span> Why did he need to teach the second? The first would have sufficed!</p>
<p class="bas indent1"><span class="nm">(e)</span><span class="cl">Admission:</span> Indeed, he did not teach the second. It was deduced from the first.</p>
<p class="bas indent1"><span class="nm">(f)</span><span class="cl">(R. Yitzchak Nafcha):</span> When Rosh Chodesh Teves falls on a weekday, three read the Parshah of Rosh Chodesh, and one reads Chanukas ha'Mizbe'ach.</p>
<p class="bas indent1"><span class="nm">(g)</span><span class="cl">(Rav Dimi of Chaifa):</span> Three read from Chanukas ha'Mizbe'ach, and one reads Rosh Chodesh.</p>
<p class="bas indent1"><span class="nm">(h)</span><span class="cl">(R. Mani):</span> Presumably, R. Yitzchak Nafcha is correct. Rosh Chodesh is preferred,since it comes more frequently.</p>
<p class="bas indent1"><span class="nm">(i)</span><span class="cl">(R. Avin):</span> Presumably, Rav Dimi is correct. There is a fourth Aliyah because it is Rosh Chodesh, therefore, he should read about Rosh Chodesh.</p>
<p class="bas indent1"><span class="nm">(j)</span><span class="cl">Question:</span> What was the conclusion?</p>
<p class="bas indent1"><span class="nm">(k)</span><span class="cl">Answer #1 (Rav Yosef):</span> Rosh Chodesh is not primary.</p>
<p class="bas indent1"><span class="nm">(l)</span><span class="cl">Answer #2 (Rabah):</span> Chanukah is not primary.</p>
<p class="bas indent1"><span class="nm">(m)</span>The Halachah follows Rabah.</p>
