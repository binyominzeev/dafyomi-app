<p class="bas indent1"><span class="nm">(a)</span>Rav Yehudah sent a gift to Avidarna (a Nochri) on the Nochri festival. He reasoned that this is permitted, for he does not serve idolatry.</p>
<p class="bas indent1"><span class="nm">(b)</span><span class="cl">Question (Rav Yosef - Beraisa - R. Meir):</span> A Ger Toshav is one who accepted in front of three Chaverim not to serve idolatry. (Avidarna did not accept in front of three!)</p>
<p class="bas indent1"><span class="nm">(c)</span><span class="cl">Answer (Rav Yehudah):</span> That refers to the Mitzvah to support him.</p>
<p class="bas indent1"><span class="nm">(d)</span><span class="cl">Question:</span> Rabah bar bar Chanah taught that if a Ger Toshav did not circumcise himself within 12 months, he is like a Nochri Min! (Avidarna has refrained from idolatry for longer than this without circumcising himself.)</p>
<p class="bas indent1"><span class="nm">(e)</span><span class="cl">Answer:</span> This is only if he accepted to circumcise himself, but did not.</p>
<p class="bas indent1"><span class="nm">(f)</span>Rava sent a gift to Bar Shishach (a Nochri) on the Nochri festival. He reasoned that this is permitted, for he does not serve idolatry. He found him in a bathhouse, surrounded by naked harlots.</p>
<p class="bas indent2"><span class="nm">1.</span><span class="cl">Bar Shishach:</span> Is your world to come as good as this?</p>
<p class="bas indent2"><span class="nm">2.</span><span class="cl">Rava:</span> Our world to come is better than this.</p>
<p class="bas indent2"><span class="nm">3.</span><span class="cl">Bar Shishach:</span> Can anything be better than this?!</p>
<p class="bas indent2"><span class="nm">4.</span><span class="cl">Rava:</span> You fear the king. We will not fear the King. (Iyun Yakov; Rashi (Vayikra 26:12) must explain like Anaf Yosef, that we will not fear our (mortal) king in the days of Mashi'ach. Alternatively, we will not tremble in fear of our King (Hash-m), but we will fear Him.)</p>
<p class="bas indent2"><span class="nm">5.</span><span class="cl">Bar Shishach:</span> I do not fear the king!</p>
<p class="bas indent3"><span class="nm">i.</span>A messenger of the king came. He told Bar Shishach 'go! The king wants you.'</p>
<p class="bas indent2"><span class="nm">6.</span><span class="cl">Bar Shishach (as he was leaving):</span> The eye that wishes to see bad things befall you, it should fall out!</p>
<p class="bas indent2"><span class="nm">7.</span>Rava answered 'Amen.' Bar Shishach's eye fell out.</p>
<p class="bas indent1"><span class="nm">(g)</span><span class="cl">Rav Papa:</span> Rava should have proven that our world to come is better from "Benos Melachim bi'Krosecha Nitzvah Shegal li'Mincha b'Chesem Ofir" (princesses will honor you (or seek to help you), your wife will have ornaments of the finest gold).</p>
<p class="bas indent1"><span class="nm">(h)</span><span class="cl">Rav Nachman bar Yitzchak:</span> He should have proven this from "Ayin Lo Ra'asa Elokim Zulasecha Ya'aseh li'Mchakeh Lo."</p>
<p class="bas subject"><span class="nm">2)</span>PAYMENT FOR WORK WITH 'YAYIN NESECH'</p>
<p class="bas indent1"><span class="nm">(a)</span><span class="cl">(Mishnah):</span> If he hired him for different work (even if he asked him to transport a barrel of Yayin Nesech, the wages are permitted).</p>
<p class="bas indent1"><span class="nm">(b)</span><span class="cl">Inference:</span> Even if he moved the barrel before he finished the day's work, the wages are permitted.</p>
<p class="bas indent1"><span class="nm">(c)</span><span class="cl">Contradiction (Beraisa):</span> If a Nochri hired a Yisrael (for different work) and asked him at the end of the day to transport a barrel of Yayin Nesech, the wages are permitted.</p>
<p class="bas indent2"><span class="nm">1.</span><span class="cl">Inference:</span> Had he asked him during the day, the wages would be forbidden!</p>
<p class="bas indent1"><span class="nm">(d)</span><span class="cl">Answer #1 (Abaye):</span> The Mishnah permits the wages only if he asked him at the end of the day.</p>
<p class="bas indent1"><span class="nm">(e)</span><span class="cl">Answer #2 (Rava):</span> In the Beraisa, he was hired to move 100 barrels for 100 Perutos (so he is not entitled to any wages until he moves the Yayin Nesech);</p>
<p class="bas indent2"><span class="nm">1.</span>In the Mishnah, he was hired to move 100 barrels for one Perutah each (so he is entitled to receive 99 Perutos for the other barrels).</p>
<p class="bas indent1"><span class="nm">(f)</span><span class="cl">Support (Beraisa):</span> If a Nochri hired a Yisrael to move 100 barrels for 100 Perutos, and one of them contained Yayin Nesech, the wages are forbidden;</p>
<p class="bas indent2"><span class="nm">1.</span>If he was hired to move 100 barrels for one Perutah each, the wages (for the other barrels) are permitted.</p>
<p class="bas indent1"><span class="nm">(g)</span><span class="cl">(Mishnah):</span> If a Nochri rented a Yisrael's donkey to carry Yayin Nesech, the wages are forbidden.</p>
<p class="bas indent1"><span class="nm">(h)</span><span class="cl">Question:</span> We already know this from the Reisha (a Yisrael's wages for working with Yayin Nesech are forbidden)!</p>
<p class="bas indent1"><span class="nm">(i)</span><span class="cl">Answer:</span> The Chidush is the following clause. If he rented it to ride on, even if he puts his wine pouch on it, (all the) rental is permitted.</p>
<p class="bas indent1"><span class="nm">(j)</span><span class="cl">Inference:</span> This teaches that a renter is not entitled to put his pouch on (otherwise, part of the wages would be for carrying Yayin Nesech);</p>
<p class="bas indent2"><span class="nm">1.</span><span class="cl">Contradiction (Beraisa):</span> If one rents a donkey to ride on, he may put on it his garment, food and drink for this journey. The owner can stop him from putting any more on it;</p>
<p class="bas indent2"><span class="nm">2.</span>The owner (who is accompanying him) can put on it the donkey's food and his own food for one day. The renter can stop him from putting more than this.</p>
<p class="bas indent1"><span class="nm">(k)</span><span class="cl">Answer (Abaye):</span> Really, a renter is entitled to put his pouch on. However, if he did not, he cannot deduct from the rental (therefore, the Yisrael does not benefit from the Yayin Nesech).</p>
<p class="bas indent1"><span class="nm">(l)</span><span class="cl">Question:</span> What is the case?</p>
<p class="bas indent2"><span class="nm">1.</span>If they will be able to buy food on the way, also the owner should be able to limit the renter to one day's food!</p>
<p class="bas indent2"><span class="nm">2.</span>If they will not be able to buy food on the way, also the owner should be allowed food for the whole journey!</p>
<p class="bas indent1"><span class="nm">(m)</span><span class="cl">Answer (Rav Papa):</span> The case is, it is hard but possible to buy in between where they lodge at nights;</p>
<p class="bas indent2"><span class="nm">1.</span>The owner is used to buying food this way, so he must do so;</p>
<p class="bas indent2"><span class="nm">2.</span>A renter is not used to buying this way, so he may take food for the whole journey.</p>
<p class="bas indent1"><span class="nm">(n)</span>The father of Rav Acha brei d'Rav Ika would bring barrels of wine, sell it to Nochrim and pour it into their pouches. He would take them across the river, and they would pay for this with the empty barrels.</p>
<p class="bas bbbline">65b----------------------------------------65b</p>
<p class="bas indent2"><span class="nm">1.</span>People told this to Abaye. (They held that the wine becomes Yayin Nesech in their pouches, and Rav Acha's father benefits from it)!</p>
<p class="bas indent1"><span class="nm">(o)</span><span class="cl">Abaye:</span> He works with permitted wine (before it lands in their pouches, and mixes with leftover drops of Yayin Nesech, or absorbs it from the walls of the pouches).</p>
<p class="bas indent1"><span class="nm">(p)</span><span class="cl">Question:</span> Their pouches are forbidden, and he benefits from them. If the pouches would break, they would need the barrels, they would not give to them to him!</p>
<p class="bas indent1"><span class="nm">(q)</span><span class="cl">Answer #1:</span> He stipulated with them that he is entitled to the barrels in any case.</p>
<p class="bas indent1"><span class="nm">(r)</span><span class="cl">Answer #2:</span> They had extra containers in case the pouches would break.</p>
<p class="bas indent1"><span class="nm">(s)</span><span class="cl">Question:</span> He transported them and their Yayin Nesech across the river (and was paid for this)!</p>
<p class="bas indent1"><span class="nm">(t)</span><span class="cl">Answer:</span> He did not transport them himself. He arranged with the ferryman to take them across for free. (The ferryman knew the people, or Rav Acha's father would give to them a sign.)</p>
<p class="bas subject"><span class="nm">3)</span>ABSORPTIONS OF 'YAYIN NESECH'</p>
<p class="bas indent1"><span class="nm">(a)</span><span class="cl">(Mishnah):</span> If Yayin Nesech fell onto grapes, the grapes must be rinsed, and then they are permitted;</p>
<p class="bas indent2"><span class="nm">1.</span>If the grapes were broken (Tosfos - or detached from the cluster, this leaves a hole), they are forbidden (for they absorb).</p>
<p class="bas indent1"><span class="nm">(b)</span>(If Yayin Nesech fell on dates or figs, if it gives a taste to them, they are forbidden - Rashbam's text omits this.).</p>
<p class="bas indent1"><span class="nm">(c)</span>A case occurred in which Baisus ben Zunin brought dried figs on a boat, and Yayin Nesech fell on them. Chachamim permitted them.</p>
<p class="bas indent1"><span class="nm">(d)</span>The general rule is, if Isur gives a beneficial taste, (what it fell into) is forbidden;</p>
<p class="bas indent2"><span class="nm">1.</span>If it does not give a beneficial taste, it is permitted, such as vinegar that fell on grits.</p>
<p class="bas indent1"><span class="nm">(e)</span><span class="cl">(Gemara) Question:</span> The episode brought does not support the Halachah. It contradicts it!</p>
<p class="bas indent1"><span class="nm">(f)</span><span class="cl">Answer:</span> The Mishnah is abbreviated. It means as follows:</p>
<p class="bas indent2"><span class="nm">1.</span>If the Yayin Nesech gave a detrimental taste, what it fell on is permitted;</p>
<p class="bas indent2"><span class="nm">2.</span>A case occurred in which Baisus ben Zunin brought dried figs on a boat, and Yayin Nesech fell on them. Chachamim permitted them. (According to our text, we must say that wine improves the taste of moist figs, but it is detrimental to dry figs.)</p>
<p class="bas indent1"><span class="nm">(g)</span>Yayin Nesech fell on wheat. Rava permitted to sell the wheat to Nochrim.</p>
<p class="bas indent1"><span class="nm">(h)</span><span class="cl">Question (Rabah bar Livai - Beraisa):</span> If a thread of (linen in a wool garment (or vice-versa), which makes it) Kil'ayim was lost in a garment, the garment may not be sold to a Nochri, nor used to make a saddle;</p>
<p class="bas indent2"><span class="nm">1.</span>One may use it for shrouds for a Mes.</p>
<p class="bas indent2"><span class="nm">2.</span><span class="cl">Question:</span> Why may it not be sold to a Nochri?</p>
<p class="bas indent2"><span class="nm">3.</span><span class="cl">Answer:</span> Perhaps he will sell it to a Yisrael;</p>
<p class="bas indent3"><span class="nm">i.</span>For the same reason, we should not sell wheat that absorbed Yayin Nesech to a Nochri!</p>
<p class="bas indent1"><span class="nm">(i)</span>Rava retracted. He permitted to make bread from the wheat and sell it to Nochrim, and not in the presence of a Yisrael (bread of a Nochri is forbidden, a Yisrael would not buy it unless he knew that the Nochri bought it from a Yisrael).</p>
<p class="bas indent1"><span class="nm">(j)</span><span class="cl">Question (Mishnah):</span> If Yayin Nesech fell onto grapes, the grapes must be rinsed, and then they are permitted. If the grapes were broken, they are forbidden.</p>
<p class="bas indent2"><span class="nm">1.</span><span class="cl">Inference:</span> If they are whole, they are permitted. Likewise, the wheat should be permitted!</p>
<p class="bas indent1"><span class="nm">(k)</span><span class="cl">Answer (Rav Papa):</span> Wheat has cracks. It absorbs as if it was broken.</p>
