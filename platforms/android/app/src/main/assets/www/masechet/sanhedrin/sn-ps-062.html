<p class="bas subject"><span class="nm">1)</span><i>KORBANOS</i> FOR IDOLATRY WITH MULTIPLE <i>AVODOS</i></p>
<p class="bas indent1"><span class="nm">(a)</span><span class="cl">Version #1 (R. Zakai):</span> If one did Zevichah, Haktarah, Nisuch and Hishtachava'ah in one He'elem (he did not remember in between that these are forbidden), he brings only one Korban.</p>
<p class="bas indent1"><span class="nm">(b)</span><span class="cl">R. Yochanan:</span> Leave the Beis Medrash (that is wrong)!</p>
<p class="bas indent1"><span class="nm">(c)</span><span class="cl">(R. Aba):</span> Tana'im argue about R. Zakai's law.</p>
<p class="bas indent2"><span class="nm">1.</span><span class="cl">(Beraisa - R. Yosi):</span> The Torah forbids all Melachos. It specifically forbids burning to teach that it is only a Lav, one is not Chayav Misah for it;</p>
<p class="bas indent2"><span class="nm">2.</span>R. Noson says, it is taught by itself to separate the Melachos (it teaches that one is liable for a single Melachah, and obligates one to bring a Korban for every Melachah done b'Shogeg).</p>
<p class="bas indent2"><span class="nm">3.</span>R. Zakai's law is like the opinion that burning was taught by itself to teach that it is only a Lav. The same applies to Hishtachava'ah (and we have no source to obligate a separate Chatas for each Avodah in one He'elem).</p>
<p class="bas indent2"><span class="nm">4.</span>According to the opinion that burning teaches that one brings a separate Chatas for each Melachah in one He'elem, Hishtachava'ah teaches similarly about Avodos.</p>
<p class="bas indent1"><span class="nm">(d)</span><span class="cl">Objection (Rav Yosef):</span> Perhaps R. Yosi said that burning was taught by itself to teach that it is only a Lav only because "me'Achas me'Henah" separates Melachos;</p>
<p class="bas indent2"><span class="nm">1.</span><span class="cl">(Beraisa - R. Yosi):</span> "V'Osah me'Achas me'Henah" - sometimes one is liable one Chatas for many Melachos, and sometimes he brings one Chatas for each transgression.</p>
<p class="bas indent2"><span class="nm">2.</span><span class="cl">(R. Yonason):</span> He learns from "v'Osah me'Achas me'Henah." It could have said 'v'Osah Achas', therefore we expound the extra 'Mem', 'Henah' and 'me'Henah':</p>
<p class="bas indent2"><span class="nm">3.</span>Achas refers to a full Melachah, e.g. writing the name 'Shimon'. "Me'Achas" obligates even for part of a Melachah, e.g. he wanted to write 'Shimon', but he only wrote the first two letters 'Shem' (Rashi - for this is also a name or word; Me'iri - he would be liable even if it were not a word);</p>
<p class="bas indent2"><span class="nm">4.</span>'Henah' teaches Avos (important Melachos used to build the Mishkan). 'Me'Henah' teaches Toldos (secondary Melachos derived from and similar to the Avos);</p>
<p class="bas indent2"><span class="nm">5.</span>Achas (transgression of one Mitzvah, do not do Melachah on Shabbos) is sometimes Henah (he must bring many Chata'os), e.g. he remembered that it was Shabbos, but he forgot (and did) different Melachos;</p>
<p class="bas indent2"><span class="nm">6.</span>Henah (many transgressions) is sometimes Achas (he brings only one Chatas), e.g. he forgot that it was Shabbos, but he remembered that he was doing Melachos.</p>
<p class="bas indent2"><span class="nm">7.</span><span class="cl">Summation of objection:</span> Regarding idolatry, R. Yosi has no other source to separate Avodos. He would agree that Hishtachava'ah separates Avodos!</p>
<p class="bas indent1"><span class="nm">(e)</span><span class="cl">Counter-question:</span> The same verse (me'Achas me'Henah) can be used to divide Avodos!</p>
<p class="bas indent2"><span class="nm">1.</span>Achas refers to a full Avodah, e.g. Shechitah. "Me'Achas" teaches that he is liable even for part of an Avodah, he slaughtered one of the two Simanim (Kaneh and Vesht, i.e. the windpipe and foodpipe);</p>
<p class="bas indent2"><span class="nm">2.</span>'Henah' teaches Avos, i.e. Shechitah, burning, Nisuch and bowing. 'Me'Henah' teaches Toldos, e.g. breaking a stick in front of it (if the idolatry is served with a stick), which resembles slaughter;</p>
<p class="bas indent2"><span class="nm">3.</span>Achas (transgression of one Mitzvah, idolatry) can be Henah (multiple Chata'os), e.g. he remembered that idolatry is forbidden, but he forgot the Avodos (and did different Avodos);</p>
<p class="bas indent2"><span class="nm">4.</span>Henah (many transgressions) can be Achas (one Chatas), e.g. he was Shogeg about idolatry, but he remembered the Avodos.</p>
<p class="bas indent2"><span class="nm">5.</span><span class="cl">Question:</span> What is the case of idolatry b'Shogeg?</p>
<p class="bas indent3"><span class="nm">i.</span>If he thought he was bowing to a synagogue, and it really was idolatry, he intended to serve Hash-m! (Surely, he is exempt.)</p>
<p class="bas indent2"><span class="nm">6.</span><span class="cl">Answer #1:</span> Rather, he bowed to a statue.</p>
<p class="bas indent2"><span class="nm">7.</span><span class="cl">Rejection:</span> If he accepted it to be his god, he was Mezid. If he did not accept it, he did not serve idolatry!</p>
<p class="bas indent2"><span class="nm">8.</span><span class="cl">Answer #2:</span> Rather, he served idolatry due to love or fear.</p>
<p class="bas indent2"><span class="nm">9.</span><span class="cl">Question:</span> This is like Abaye, who obligates for serving due to love or fear;</p>
<p class="bas indent3"><span class="nm">i.</span>According to Rava, who exempts, how can we answer?</p>
<p class="bas indent2"><span class="nm">10.</span><span class="cl">Answer #3:</span> He thought that idolatry is permitted.</p>
<p class="bas indent2"><span class="nm">11.</span><span class="cl">Question:</span> If so, we can settle a question of Rava!</p>
<p class="bas indent3"><span class="nm">i.</span><span class="cl">Question (Rava):</span> If one forgot that it was Shabbos <i>and</i> he forgot Melachos (and did them), does he bring just one Chatas (for forgetting Shabbos), or one for each Melachah?</p>
<p class="bas indent3"><span class="nm">ii.</span>Just like here, he forgot that idolatry is forbidden (and we must say that he also forgot that Avodos are forbidden), he brings only one Korban, also regarding Shabbos! (We retract from the previous explanation of Henah that is Achas. We now say that he was Shogeg about idolatry <i>and</i> the Avodos.)</p>
<p class="bas indent2"><span class="nm">12.</span><span class="cl">Answer:</span> Indeed, Rava will answer as we said, and we resolve his question.</p>
<p class="bas indent1"><span class="nm">(f)</span><span class="cl">Answer:</span> We cannot establish "me'Achas me'Henah" to refer to idolatry. This verse is in the Parshah of Chata'os in Vayikra, where it says that an anointed Kohen brings a bull, a Nasi brings a male goat, and a commoner brings a female lamb or goat;</p>
<p class="bas indent2"><span class="nm">1.</span><span class="cl">(Mishnah):</span> For idolatry, an anointed Kohen or Nasi brings a female goat, like a commoner.</p>
<p class="bas indent1"><span class="nm">(g)</span><span class="cl">Conclusion:</span> Rav Yosef's objection is affirmed. (R. Zakai must learn from "v'Lo So'ovdem" that all Avodos are considered one.)</p>

<p class="bas subject"><span class="nm">2)</span>SHABBOS IS DIFFERENT FROM OTHER <i>MITZVOS</i></p>
<p class="bas indent1"><span class="nm">(a)</span><span class="cl">Version #2 (Rav Shmuel bar Yehudah):</span> R. Zakai taught in front of R. Yochanan as follows:</p>
<p class="bas indent2"><span class="nm">1.</span>There is a stringency of Shabbos over other Mitzvos, and there is a stringency of other Mitzvos over Shabbos:</p>
<p class="bas indent3"><span class="nm">i.</span>The stringency of Shabbos is that if two Melachos were done in one He'elem, he is liable for each one. This does not apply to other Mitzvos.</p>
<p class="bas indent3"><span class="nm">ii.</span>The stringency of other Mitzvos is that if someone transgressed b'Shogeg without intention he is liable. This does not apply to Shabbos (one is liable only if he intended to do the Melachah).</p>
<p class="bas indent1"><span class="nm">(b)</span><span class="cl">Question:</span> He said that regarding Shabbos, if two Melachos were done in one He'elem, he is liable for each one. What is the case?</p>
<p class="bas indent2"><span class="nm">1.</span><span class="cl">Suggestion:</span> He reaped and grinded.</p>
<p class="bas indent2"><span class="nm">2.</span><span class="cl">Rejection:</span> The corresponding case of other Mitzvos is eating Chelev and blood. Also there he is liable for each!</p>
<p class="bas indent1"><span class="nm">(c)</span><span class="cl">Answer #1:</span> Regarding other Mitzvos, we must say that he ate Chelev twice (in one He'elem).</p>
<p class="bas indent1"><span class="nm">(d)</span><span class="cl">Rejection:</span> Also regarding Shabbos, if he reaped twice he is liable only once!</p>
<p class="bas indent2"><span class="nm">1.</span>This is why R. Yochanan told him to leave the Beis Medrash.</p>
<p class="bas indent1"><span class="nm">(e)</span><span class="cl">Question (and Answer #2):</span> Perhaps indeed, he reaped and grinded. The corresponding case of other Mitzvos is idolatry, like R. Ami taught!</p>
<p class="bas indent2"><span class="nm">1.</span><span class="cl">(R. Ami):</span> If someone did Zevichah, Haktarah and Nisuch in one He'elem, he is liable only one Korban.</p>
<p class="bas indent1"><span class="nm">(f)</span><span class="cl">Answer:</span> We cannot establish it regarding idolatry due to the Seifa:. the stringency of other Mitzvos is that one who transgressed b'Shogeg without intent is liable, unlike Shabbos.</p>
<p class="bas indent2"><span class="nm">1.</span><span class="cl">Question:</span> How could we establish this regarding idolatry?</p>
<p class="bas indent3"><span class="nm">i.</span>If he thought he was bowing to a synagogue, and really it was idolatry, he intended to serve Hash-m!</p>
<p class="bas indent2"><span class="nm">2.</span><span class="cl">Answer #1:</span> Rather, he bowed to a statue.</p>
<p class="bas indent2"><span class="nm">3.</span><span class="cl">Rejection:</span> If he accepted it to be his god, he was Mezid. If not, he did not serve idolatry!</p>
<p class="bas indent2"><span class="nm">4.</span><span class="cl">Answer #2:</span> Rather, he served idolatry due to love or fear.</p>
<p class="bas indent2"><span class="nm">5.</span><span class="cl">Question:</span> This is like Abaye, who obligates for serving due to love or fear;</p>
<p class="bas indent3"><span class="nm">i.</span>According to Rava, who exempts, how can we answer?</p>
<p class="bas indent2"><span class="nm">6.</span><span class="cl">Answer #3:</span> He thought that idolatry is permitted.</p>
<p class="bas indent2"><span class="nm">7.</span><span class="cl">Question:</span> R. Zakai taught that regarding Shabbos, he is totally exempt;</p>
<p class="bas indent3"><span class="nm">i.</span>Rava asked only whether one who forgot that it was Shabbos and forgot Melachos brings one Chatas, or for each Melachah. He never suggested that he is totally exempt!</p>
<p class="bas indent1"><span class="nm">(g)</span><span class="cl">Question:</span> Perhaps the Reisha refers to idolatry, and the Seifa refers to a different Mitzvah!</p>
<p class="bas indent2"><span class="nm">1.</span>Transgressing b'Shogeg without intention. He thought that saliva was on his tongue and he swallowed it (and it was really Chelev);</p>
<p class="bas indent2"><span class="nm">2.</span>The corresponding case regarding Shabbos is, he intended to pick up something detached, and cut something attached to the ground. He is exempt.</p>
<p class="bas indent3"><span class="nm">i.</span><span class="cl">(Rav Nachman):</span> Mis'asek (doing an action without intention) regarding Arayos or forbidden foods is liable, for he received pleasure;</p>
<p class="bas indent3"><span class="nm">ii.</span>Misasek regarding Shabbos is exempt. The Torah forbids only Melachah Machsheves (one who accomplished his intention).</p>
<p class="bas indent1"><span class="nm">(h)</span><span class="cl">Answer:</span> R. Yochanan rejected this possibility because (also elsewhere) he demands that the Reisha of a Mishnah or Beraisa resemble the Seifa.</p>
<p class="bas indent2"><span class="nm">1.</span><span class="cl">(R. Yochanan):</span> If someone can explain the Mishnah of a barrel (that a watchman moved without permission) according to one Tana, I will carry his clothes to the bathhouse.</p>
