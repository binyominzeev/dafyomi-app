<p class="bas indent1"><span class="nm">(a)</span><span class="cl">(R. Yochanan):</span> A boy (even under 13) who has [two pubic] hairs (which are a sign of adulthood in a 13 year-old) joins for a Zimun.</p>
<p class="bas indent1"><span class="nm">(b)</span><span class="cl">Support (Beraisa):</span> If a boy has two hairs, he joins for a Zimun; if not, not;</p>
<p class="bas indent2"><span class="nm">1.</span>We are not particular about minors (they may join in any case).</p>
<p class="bas indent2"><span class="nm">2.</span><span class="cl">Objection:</span> The Reisha said that he must have two hairs!</p>
<p class="bas indent2"><span class="nm">3.</span><span class="cl">Suggestion:</span> It means, if he has two hairs, we are not particular about his age.</p>
<p class="bas indent1"><span class="nm">(c)</span>The Halachah follows Rav Nachman, it is unlike all of these teachings.</p>
<p class="bas indent2"><span class="nm">1.</span><span class="cl">(Rav Nachman):</span> If a minor knows to Whom we bless, he joins for a Zimun.</p>
<p class="bas indent1"><span class="nm">(d)</span><span class="cl">Rabah (to Abaye and Rava, who were minors at the time):</span> To Whom do we bless?</p>
<p class="bas indent1"><span class="nm">(e)</span><span class="cl">Abaye and Rava:</span> We bless to the Merciful One!</p>
<p class="bas indent1"><span class="nm">(f)</span><span class="cl">Rabah:</span> Where is He?</p>
<p class="bas indent1"><span class="nm">(g)</span>Rava pointed to the roof; Abaye went outside and pointed to the heavens.</p>
<p class="bas indent1"><span class="nm">(h)</span><span class="cl">Rabah:</span> You two will be Chachamim!</p>
<p class="bas indent2"><span class="nm">1.</span>This is like people say -- one can tell how a pumpkin will be from the moment it buds.</p>
<p class="bas indent1"><span class="nm">(i)</span><span class="cl">(Rav Yehudah brei d'Rav Shmuel bar Shilas):</span> If nine people ate bread and one ate vegetables, they join (to make ten to say Hash-m's name in the Zimun).</p>
<p class="bas indent1"><span class="nm">(j)</span><span class="cl">Questions (R. Zeira):</span> If seven (or eight) ate bread and three (or two) ate vegetables, do they join?</p>
<p class="bas indent1"><span class="nm">(k)</span><span class="cl">Answer (Rav Yehudah):</span> They join.</p>
<p class="bas indent1"><span class="nm">(l)</span><span class="cl">Version #1 (our text) R. Zeira:</span> I need not ask whether or not four can join to six who ate bread (surely, they do not)!</p>
<p class="bas indent1"><span class="nm">(m)</span>Version #2 (text in the margin, presumably Rashi's text) R. Zeira: I regret that I did not ask if four can join! (End of Version #2)</p>
<p class="bas indent1"><span class="nm">(n)</span><span class="cl">R. Yirmeyah:</span> It is good that you did not ask; two and three join, because the majority ate bread -- surely, the same applies when four ate vegetables!</p>
<p class="bas indent1"><span class="nm">(o)</span>R. Zeira held that (Version #2 - he was in doubt, perhaps) a noticeable majority is required.</p>
<p class="bas subject"><span class="nm">2)</span>WHO CAN BE <i>MOTZI</i> OTHERS</p>
<p class="bas indent1"><span class="nm">(a)</span>Yanai ha'Melech and his queen ate bread; since he had killed the Chachamim, there was no one to bless for them.</p>
<p class="bas indent2"><span class="nm">1.</span><span class="cl">Yanai (to the queen):</span> Is there anyone who can bless for us?</p>
<p class="bas indent2"><span class="nm">2.</span><span class="cl">The queen:</span> Swear to me that if I bring someone, you will not harm him!</p>
<p class="bas indent2"><span class="nm">3.</span>He swore; she brought her brother, Shimon ben Shetach (whom she had saved by hiding him).</p>
<p class="bas indent2"><span class="nm">4.</span>Yanai put Shimon ben Shetach between himself and the queen and said, "See what honor I give to you!"</p>
<p class="bas indent2"><span class="nm">5.</span><span class="cl">Shimon ben Shetach:</span> You do not honor me, rather, the Torah [honors those who embrace it] -- "Salseleha u'Seromemeka Techabedcha Ki Sechabkenah."</p>
<p class="bas indent2"><span class="nm">6.</span><span class="cl">Yanai (to the queen):</span> See, he does not accept authority!</p>
<p class="bas indent2"><span class="nm">7.</span>They gave the cup to him to bless.</p>
<p class="bas indent2"><span class="nm">8.</span><span class="cl">Shimon ben Shetach:</span> What should I bless [if I did not eat anything] -- "Blessed is He from Whom Yanai and his friends ate"?! He drank the cup; they gave him another cup, he blessed (for everyone).</p>
<p class="bas indent2"><span class="nm">9.</span><span class="cl">R. Aba:</span> This is Shimon ben Shetach's opinion (that one blesses Birkas ha'Mazon after wine, Chachamim argue with him).</p>
<p class="bas indent1"><span class="nm">(b)</span><span class="cl">(R. Chiya bar Aba):</span> One may not be Motzi others (in Birkas ha'Mazon) unless he ate a k'Zayis of grain.</p>
<p class="bas indent1"><span class="nm">(c)</span><span class="cl">Question (Beraisa - R. Shimon ben Gamliel):</span> If one sat with people (eating a meal), even if he ate only vegetables dipped in brine or one fig, he joins (for a Zimun).</p>
<p class="bas indent1"><span class="nm">(d)</span><span class="cl">Answer:</span> He joins, but he may not be Motzi them unless he ate a k'Zayis of grain.</p>
<p class="bas indent1"><span class="nm">(e)</span><span class="cl">(Rav Chana bar Yehudah):</span> If one sat with people, even if he ate only vegetables dipped in brine or one fig, he joins;</p>

<p class="bas indent1"><span class="nm">(f)</span><span class="cl">(Rav Chana bar Yehudah):</span> The Halachah is, if one ate a vegetable leaf or drank a cup of wine, he joins for a Zimun;</p>
<p class="bas indent2"><span class="nm">1.</span>He may not be Motzi others unless he ate a k'Zayis of grain.</p>
<p class="bas subject"><span class="nm">3)</span>THE SOURCE FOR <i>BIRKAS HA'MAZON</i></p>
<p class="bas indent1"><span class="nm">(a)</span><span class="cl">(Rav Nachman):</span> Moshe enacted Birkas ha'Zan when the manna fell; Yehoshua enacted Birkas ha'Aretz when the Jewish people entered Eretz Yisrael; David and Shlomo enacted Boneh Yerushalayim;</p>
<p class="bas indent2"><span class="nm">1.</span>David enacted "Al Yisrael Amecha v'Al Yerushalayim Irecha," Shlomo enacted "Al ha'Bayis ha'Gadol veha'Kadosh";</p>
<p class="bas indent1"><span class="nm">(b)</span>Ha'Tov veha'Metiv was enacted in Yavneh on account of those killed in Beitar:</p>
<p class="bas indent2"><span class="nm">1.</span><span class="cl">(Rav Masna):</span> Ha'Tov veha'Metiv was enacted in Yavneh on the day that those killed in Beitar were able to be buried;</p>
<p class="bas indent2"><span class="nm">2.</span>"Ha'Tov" -- Hash-m preserved the bodies from decaying; "veha'Metiv" -- the Jews were allowed to bury the bodies.</p>
<p class="bas indent1"><span class="nm">(c)</span><span class="cl">(Beraisa):</span> The first Berachah of Birkas ha'Mazon is Birkas ha'Zan, the second is Birkas ha'Aretz, the third is Boneh Yerushalayim, the fourth is ha'Tov veha'Metiv;</p>
<p class="bas indent2"><span class="nm">1.</span>On Shabbos we (Rashi - may) begin and end with consolation (or requests for mercy for Yerushalayim), and say Kedushas ha'Yom in the middle.</p>
<p class="bas indent2"><span class="nm">2.</span>R. Eliezer says, one may say it in Boneh Yerushalayim, or in Birkas ha'Aretz, or in ha'Tov veha'Metiv.</p>
<p class="bas indent2"><span class="nm">3.</span>Chachamim say, it must be said in Boneh Yerushalayim.</p>
<p class="bas indent2"><span class="nm">4.</span><span class="cl">Question:</span> Chachamim do not argue with the first Tana!</p>
<p class="bas indent2"><span class="nm">5.</span><span class="cl">Answer:</span> They argue about b'Di'eved (Chachamim require repeating Birkas ha'Mazon if Kedushas ha'Yom was said in a different Berachah, the first Tana does not).</p>
<p class="bas indent1"><span class="nm">(d)</span><span class="cl">(Beraisa) Question:</span> What is the source for Birkas ha'Mazon mid'Oraisa?</p>
<p class="bas indent1"><span class="nm">(e)</span><span class="cl">Answer #1:</span> "V'Achalta v'Savata u'Verachta" refers to Birkas ha'Zan; "Es Hash-m Elokecha" refers to Birkas ha'Zimun, "Al ha'Aretz" refers to Birkas ha'Aretz;</p>
<p class="bas indent2"><span class="nm">1.</span>"Ha'Tovah" refers to Boneh Yerushalayim -- "ha'Har ha'Tov ha'Zeh veha'Levanon" refers to Har ha'Bayis and the Mikdash;</p>
<p class="bas indent2"><span class="nm">2.</span>"Asher Nasan Lach" refers to ha'Tov veha'Metiv.</p>
<p class="bas indent2"><span class="nm">3.</span><span class="cl">Question:</span> This teaches about Birkas ha'Mazon after eating -- what is the source for the obligation to say a Berachah Rishonah before eating?</p>
<p class="bas indent2"><span class="nm">4.</span><span class="cl">Answer:</span> We learn from a Kal va'Chomer -- if one must bless when he is satiated, all the more so when he is hungry!</p>
<p class="bas indent1"><span class="nm">(f)</span><span class="cl">Answer #2 (Rebbi):</span> The Kal va'Chomer is not needed!</p>
<p class="bas indent2"><span class="nm">1.</span>"V'Achalta v'Savata u'Verachta" refers to Birkas ha'Zan; "Gadlu la'Sh-m Iti" refers to Birkas ha'Zimun, "Al ha'Aretz" refers to Birkas ha'Aretz, "Ha'Tovah" refers to Boneh Yerushalayim;</p>
<p class="bas indent2"><span class="nm">2.</span>Ha'Tov veha'Metiv was enacted in Yavneh;</p>
<p class="bas indent2"><span class="nm">3.</span><span class="cl">Question:</span> This is the source to bless after eating -- what is the source to bless before eating?</p>
<p class="bas indent2"><span class="nm">4.</span><span class="cl">Answer:</span> "Asher Nasan Lach" -- you must bless from when He gives food to you (even before eating).</p>
<p class="bas indent1"><span class="nm">(g)</span><span class="cl">Answer #3 (R. Yitzchak):</span> We do not need that verse (to obligate blessing before eating, nor the Kal va'Chomer);</p>
<p class="bas indent2"><span class="nm">1.</span>It says "u'Verach (Hash-m will bless) Es Lachmecha v'Es Meimecha" -- we read this "u'Varech" (you should bless);</p>
<p class="bas indent2"><span class="nm">2.</span>It is called "Lechem" before you eat it.</p>
<p class="bas indent1"><span class="nm">(h)</span><span class="cl">Answer #4 (R. Nasan):</span> We do not need the above sources;</p>
<p class="bas indent2"><span class="nm">1.</span>[The women who told Shaul where to find Shmuel said,] "... Lo Yochal ha'Am Ad Bo'o Ki Hu Yevarech ha'Zevach Acharei Chen Yochlu ha'Keru'im" (they will not eat until Shmuel will make a Berachah Rishonah).</p>
<p class="bas indent2"><span class="nm">2.</span><span class="cl">Question:</span> Why did they need to say all this?</p>
<p class="bas indent2"><span class="nm">3.</span><span class="cl">Answer #1:</span> Women are naturally wordy.</p>
<p class="bas indent2"><span class="nm">4.</span><span class="cl">Answer #2 (Shmuel):</span> They spoke at length to have more time to look at Shaul's beauty -- "mi'Shichmo va'Ma'alah Gavoha mi'Kol ha'Am."</p>
<p class="bas indent2"><span class="nm">5.</span><span class="cl">Answer #3 (R. Yochanan):</span> This was because the reign of each king is unchangeably fixed to a moment (Shmuel needed to reign for a few extra moments before Shaul could begin his reign).</p>
<p class="bas indent1"><span class="nm">(i)</span><span class="cl">Question:</span> This teaches about Birkas ha'Mazon; what is the source to require Birkas ha'Torah?</p>
<p class="bas indent1"><span class="nm">(j)</span><span class="cl">Answer #1 (R. Yishmael):</span> If we must bless for [bread, which gives] temporary life, all the more so for Torah, which gives eternal life!</p>
<p class="bas indent1"><span class="nm">(k)</span><span class="cl">Answer #2 (R. Chiya bar Nachmani citing R. Yishmael):</span> We do not need the Kal va'Chomer -- it says "Al ha'Aretz Ha'Tovah Asher <i>Nasan</i> Lach," like it says "v'Etnah Lecha... veha'Torah."</p>
<p class="bas indent2"><span class="nm">1.</span><span class="cl">Question (R. Meir):</span> What is the source that one must bless on bad [tidings] like he blesses on good?</p>
<p class="bas indent2"><span class="nm">2.</span><span class="cl">Answer:</span> "Asher Nasan Lach Hash-m Elokecha" -- Elokecha means "your Judge," whether His verdict was for good or for punishment.</p>
<p class="bas indent1"><span class="nm">(l)</span><span class="cl">Answer #3 (R. Yehudah ben Bava):</span> We have a different source to require Birkas ha'Torah!</p>
<p class="bas indent2"><span class="nm">1.</span>Had it said "[Eretz] Tovah," this would only teach about [Birkas] ha'Torah -- "Ki Lekach Tov Nasati Lachem Torasi...";</p>
<p class="bas indent2"><span class="nm">2.</span>Since it says "Eretz <i>ha</i>'Tovah," we also learn Boneh Yerushalayim -- "ha'Har ha'Tov ha'Zeh...."</p>
