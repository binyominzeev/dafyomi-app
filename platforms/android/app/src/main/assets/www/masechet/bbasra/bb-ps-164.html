<p class="dedicationbox">BAVA BASRA 164 - A week of learning has been dedicated towards meriting a Refu'ah Sheleimah for Eliezer Lipa ben Yetta, by Mr. and Mrs. Kornfeld of Yerushalayim. </p>

<p class="bas subject"><span class="nm">1)</span>DOCUMENTS ON ERASED PARCHMENT</p>
<p class="bas indent1"><span class="nm">(a)</span><span class="cl">(Rav):</span> If a document and the signatures are both on erased parchment, it is valid.</p>
<p class="bas indent1"><span class="nm">(b)</span><span class="cl">Question:</span> Perhaps he will take such a (signed) document, erase the text, and write a new text!</p>
<p class="bas indent1"><span class="nm">(c)</span><span class="cl">Answer:</span> If he does, the place of the text will have been erased twice. It looks different that parchment erased once, and the forgery will be evident.</p>
<p class="bas indent1"><span class="nm">(d)</span><span class="cl">Question:</span> Perhaps he will write a document on erased parchment, put ink underneath, erase it, and have the witnesses sign;</p>
<p class="bas indent2"><span class="nm">1.</span>When he later erases (and rewrites) the text, the text and the signatures will both be on parchment that was erased twice!</p>
<p class="bas indent1"><span class="nm">(e)</span><span class="cl">Answer (Abaye):</span> Rav holds that witnesses will not sign on erased parchment unless it was erased in front of them (and looks like the rest of the document).</p>
<p class="bas indent1"><span class="nm">(f)</span><span class="cl">Question (Beraisa):</span> If a document is on clear parchment and the signatures are on erased parchment, it is valid.</p>
<p class="bas indent2"><span class="nm">1.</span>Perhaps he will erase the text, and write a new text (Rav allows a document if the text and signatures are both on parchment erased once)!</p>
<p class="bas indent1"><span class="nm">(g)</span><span class="cl">Answer:</span> If witnesses sign on erased parchment and the text is on clear parchment, the witnesses write this.</p>
<p class="bas indent1"><span class="nm">(h)</span><span class="cl">Question:</span> If they write it below their signatures, the bearer could cut it off. If they write it above their signatures, the bearer could erase it!</p>
<p class="bas indent1"><span class="nm">(i)</span><span class="cl">Answer:</span> They write this between the signatures.</p>
<p class="bas indent1"><span class="nm">(j)</span><span class="cl">Question (end of the Beraisa):</span> If the text is on erased parchment and the signatures are on clear parchment, it is invalid.</p>
<p class="bas indent2"><span class="nm">1.</span>The witnesses should write this, and the document should be valid!</p>
<p class="bas indent2"><span class="nm">2.</span><span class="cl">Suggestion:</span> We are concerned lest the bearer erase the text and write a new text.</p>
<p class="bas indent2"><span class="nm">3.</span><span class="cl">Rejection:</span> We said that parchment erased twice is recognizably different than parchment erased once!</p>
<p class="bas indent1"><span class="nm">(k)</span><span class="cl">Answer:</span> When part of a parchment was erased twice and another part was erased once, this is recognizable. Here, part was erased twice, and part is clear (so it is not evident that the text was erased twice).</p>
<p class="bas indent1"><span class="nm">(l)</span><span class="cl">Question:</span> We should take a clear parchment, erase it, and compare it to the text!</p>
<p class="bas indent1"><span class="nm">(m)</span><span class="cl">Answer:</span> Different parchments look different when they are erased.</p>
<p class="bas indent1"><span class="nm">(n)</span><span class="cl">Question:</span> After validating the signatures, we should erase them, and see if it resembles the text!</p>
<p class="bas indent1"><span class="nm">(o)</span><span class="cl">Answer #1 (R. Hoshaya):</span> Parchment erased today looks different than parchment erased yesterday.</p>
<p class="bas indent1"><span class="nm">(p)</span><span class="cl">[Objection:</span> We can leave it around (until it looks like parchment erased some days ago, and compare it)! Tosfos - some texts delete this, for there will still be a difference between the parchments.]</p>
<p class="bas indent1"><span class="nm">(q)</span><span class="cl">Answer #2 (R. Yirmeyah):</span> We are concerned lest Beis Din err (and not wait).]</p>
<p class="bas subject"><span class="nm">2)</span>HOW GITIN ARE DATED</p>
<p class="bas indent1"><span class="nm">(a)</span><span class="cl">(Mishnah - R. Chanina ben Gamliel):</span> If witnesses signed on the inside of a tied Get (it is valid, because it can be converted to a standard Get).</p>
<p class="bas indent1"><span class="nm">(b)</span><span class="cl">Objection (Rebbi):</span> The dates of standard Gitin and tied Gitin are written differently!</p>
<p class="bas bbbline">164b----------------------------------------164b</p>
<p class="bas indent2"><span class="nm">1.</span>A standard Get is dated according to the true year of the king's reign. In a tied Get, the date is written a year more than his actual reign.</p>
<p class="bas indent2"><span class="nm">2.</span>Perhaps Reuven borrowed money with a tied Get, and when he paid, Shimon said 'I do not have the document to return it', and instead gave a receipt;</p>
<p class="bas indent3"><span class="nm">i.</span>Later, Shimon will make it a standard Get, and its date is after the receipt (showing that Reuven did not repay this loan, rather, a previous loan)!</p>
<p class="bas indent1"><span class="nm">(c)</span><span class="cl">Answer:</span> R. Chanina ben Gamliel holds that we do not write receipts. (Reuven will not pay until Shimon finds the document.)</p>
<p class="bas indent1"><span class="nm">(d)</span><span class="cl">Question:</span> Did Rebbi really understand tied Gitin?</p>
<p class="bas indent2"><span class="nm">1.</span>A tied Get was brought in front of Rebbi. He said 'it is postdated.'</p>
<p class="bas indent2"><span class="nm">2.</span><span class="cl">Zunin (a Chacham):</span> This is the custom. In a tied Get, the date is written a year more than the king's actual reign.</p>
<p class="bas indent1"><span class="nm">(e)</span><span class="cl">Answer:</span> After Zunin explained to him, he understood.</p>
<p class="bas indent1"><span class="nm">(f)</span>A standard Get was dated 'in the year of (King) Ploni <i>Archan</i>' (this will be explained).</p>
<p class="bas indent1"><span class="nm">(g)</span><span class="cl">(R. Chanina):</span> It was written in his first year (then he is called Archan). The lien starts from then.</p>
<p class="bas indent1"><span class="nm">(h)</span><span class="cl">Question:</span> Perhaps Archan means that he has reigned for a long time (and the lien starts only this year)!</p>
<p class="bas indent1"><span class="nm">(i)</span><span class="cl">Answer (R. Hoshaya):</span> The custom is, the first year he is called Archan. The second year he is called Digun.</p>
<p class="bas indent1"><span class="nm">(j)</span><span class="cl">Question:</span> Perhaps the king was deposed and reinstated (without our knowledge), and the Get says Archan because it was in the first year he was reinstated (but we think that the lien is from the first year he ever reigned)!</p>
<p class="bas indent1"><span class="nm">(k)</span><span class="cl">Answer (R. Yirmeyah):</span> In such a case, he is called Archan Digun.</p>
<p class="bas indent1"><span class="nm">(l)</span><span class="cl">(Beraisa - Sumchus):</span> If a man accepted Nezirus 'Heina' this means once. 'Digun', 'Trigun', 'Tetrigun' and 'Pentigun' mean, respectively, two, three, four and five times.</p>
<p class="bas indent1"><span class="nm">(m)</span><span class="cl">(Beraisa):</span> A house that is round, three sided or five sided does not receive Tum'as Tzara'as. A four sided house receives Tzara'as.</p>
<p class="bas indent1"><span class="nm">(n)</span><span class="cl">Question:</span> What is the source of this?</p>
<p class="bas indent1"><span class="nm">(o)</span><span class="cl">(Beraisa):</span> It does not say 'Kir', rather, "b'Kiros". This teaches about two walls. Also later in the Parshah it says "b'Kiros".</p>
<p class="bas indent1"><span class="nm">(p)</span>A tied Get was brought in front of Rebbi. He said 'it is not dated'!</p>
<p class="bas indent1"><span class="nm">(q)</span><span class="cl">R. Shimon bar Rebbi:</span> Perhaps it is covered between the folds.</p>
<p class="bas indent2"><span class="nm">1.</span>Rebbi unfolded it and saw the date. Rebbi looked cross (because the date was so concealed; alternatively, Rebbi preferred standard Gitin).</p>
<p class="bas indent2"><span class="nm">2.</span><span class="cl">R. Shimon:</span> I did not write it. Yehudah the scribe wrote it.</p>
<p class="bas indent2"><span class="nm">3.</span><span class="cl">Rebbi:</span> Do not speak Lashon ha'Ra!</p>
<p class="bas subject"><span class="nm">3)</span>LASHON HA'RA</p>
<p class="bas indent1"><span class="nm">(a)</span>Rebbi once praised a Sefer Tehilim. His son Shimon said 'I did not write it. Yehudah the scribe wrote it.'</p>
<p class="bas indent2"><span class="nm">1.</span><span class="cl">Rebbi:</span> Do not speak Lashon ha'Ra!</p>
<p class="bas indent1"><span class="nm">(b)</span><span class="cl">Question:</span> Granted, regarding the tied Get, it was Lashon ha'Ra to say that Yehudah wrote it;</p>
<p class="bas indent2"><span class="nm">1.</span>Why was it Lashon ha'Ra to say that he wrote the Sefer Tehilim?</p>
<p class="bas indent1"><span class="nm">(c)</span><span class="cl">Answer (Rav Dimi, brother of Rav Safra):</span> One should not speak favorably of another, lest he (R. Gershom - others) come to speak to his detriment.</p>
<p class="bas indent1"><span class="nm">(d)</span><span class="cl">(Rav Amram):</span> There are three transgressions that (almost all) people transgress every day: thought of (sexual) transgression, <i>Iyun</i> in prayer (Rashbam - feeling that he is worthy to be answered; Tosfos - lack of concentration), and Lashon ha'Ra.</p>
<p class="bas indent1"><span class="nm">(e)</span><span class="cl">Objection:</span> People do not speak Lashon ha'Ra every day!</p>
<p class="bas indent1"><span class="nm">(f)</span><span class="cl">Correction:</span> Rather, they transgress Avak Lashon ha'Ra (a statement that can be understood positively or negatively).</p>
<p class="bas indent1"><span class="nm">(g)</span><span class="cl">(Rav Yehudah):</span> Most people transgress theft (laws of buying and selling), a minority of people have Bi'ah with Arayos, and (virtually) everyone transgresses Lashon ha'Ra.</p>
<p class="bas indent1"><span class="nm">(h)</span><span class="cl">Objection:</span> Not everyone transgresses Lashon ha'Ra!</p>
<p class="bas indent1"><span class="nm">(i)</span><span class="cl">Correction:</span> Rather, they transgress Avak Lashon ha'Ra.</p>
