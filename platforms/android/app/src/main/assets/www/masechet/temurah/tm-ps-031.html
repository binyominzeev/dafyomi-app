<p class="bas indent1"><span class="nm">(a)</span><span class="cl">(Mishnah):</span> The Vlad of a Tereifah...</p>
<p class="bas indent1"><span class="nm">(b)</span>According to the opinion that a Tereifah can (become pregnant and) give birth, the case is, it became Tereifah and then became pregnant;</p>
<p class="bas indent2"><span class="nm">1.</span>R. Eliezer forbids Zeh v'Zeh Gorem, and Chachamim permit;</p>
<p class="bas indent1"><span class="nm">(c)</span>According to the opinion that a Tereifah cannot (become pregnant and) give birth, the case is, it was pregnant and then became Tereifah;</p>
<p class="bas indent2"><span class="nm">1.</span>R. Eliezer holds that Ubar Yerech Imo, and Chachamim hold that Ubar Lav Yerech Imo.</p>
<p class="bas indent1"><span class="nm">(d)</span><span class="cl">(Rav Huna):</span> Chachamim agree with R. Eliezer that a chick that comes from an egg of a Tereifah is forbidden.</p>
<p class="bas indent1"><span class="nm">(e)</span><span class="cl">Question:</span> What is the reason?</p>
<p class="bas indent1"><span class="nm">(f)</span><span class="cl">Answer:</span> They argue only about a Vlad of a Behemah, for it grows (by itself) unattached to its mother. An egg (in a bird is attached to and) grows from the mother, so all forbid it like the mother.</p>
<p class="bas indent1"><span class="nm">(g)</span><span class="cl">Support (Rava - Beraisa - R. Eliezer):</span> A spoonful (a single or double handful) of worms from a live person is Tamei (some say - after the person dies);</p>
<p class="bas indent2"><span class="nm">1.</span>Chachamim are Metaher.</p>
<p class="bas indent2"><span class="nm">2.</span>Chachamim argue only about worms, for it is merely Pirsha (something that comes from the person), but they admit about an egg. It is part of the bird itself.</p>
<p class="bas indent1"><span class="nm">(h)</span><span class="cl">Objection (Abaye):</span> Just the contrary! R. Eliezer argues only about worms, for a live person is called worms - "Af Ki Enosh Rimah u'Ven Adam Tola'ah";</p>
<p class="bas indent2"><span class="nm">1.</span>All permit a chick that comes from an egg of a Tereifah. Before it develops, it putrefies, so it is like earth (the Isur goes away).</p>
<p class="bas indent1"><span class="nm">(i)</span><span class="cl">Support (Abaye, for himself - Beraisa):</span> R. Eliezer agrees that a chick that comes from an egg of a Tereifah is permitted.</p>
<p class="bas indent1"><span class="nm">(j)</span><span class="cl">Rava:</span> Indeed, the Beraisa supports you.</p>
<p class="bas indent1"><span class="nm">(k)</span><span class="cl">(Mishnah - R. Chanina ben Antignos):</span> If a Kosher animal...</p>
<p class="bas indent1"><span class="nm">(l)</span><span class="cl">Question:</span> What is the reason?</p>
<p class="bas indent2"><span class="nm">1.</span><span class="cl">Suggestion:</span> It is forbidden because it was fattened by the Tereifah's milk.</p>
<p class="bas indent2"><span class="nm">2.</span><span class="cl">Rejection:</span> If so, an animal that ate vetch of idolatry should be forbidden! (According to Version #1 above (29b), it is forbidden only if it was Muktzeh. According to Version #2, Muktzeh becomes permitted after eating such vetch!)</p>
<p class="bas indent1"><span class="nm">(m)</span><span class="cl">Answer (R. Chanina Trita'ah):</span> The case is, it nursed from a Tereifah every (Rambam - that) morning. This is enough to sustain it. (Therefore, even if it also ate permitted food, it is forbidden. The Rema (YD 60:1, based on Tosfos), forbids it even to people. The Gra proves this from the Sifri. Shach - Tosfos is unsure about this, and the Mordechai permits because milk of a Tereifah is Mutar b'Hana'ah.)</p>
<p class="bas indent1"><span class="nm">(n)</span><span class="cl">(Mishnah):</span> If any Kodshim became Tereifah, it may not be redeemed...</p>
<p class="bas indent1"><span class="nm">(o)</span><span class="cl">Version #1 - Question:</span> What is the source of this?</p>
<p class="bas indent1"><span class="nm">(p)</span><span class="cl">Answer (Beraisa):</span> (Regarding Pesulei ha'Mukdashim it says) "Tizbach (slaughter)" but do not shear. "V'Achalta (you will eat)", but it is not for your dog to eat. "(You may eat) Basar", but not milk;</p>
<p class="bas indent2"><span class="nm">1.</span>This teaches that we may not redeem Kodshim to feed them to dogs.</p>
<p class="bas indent1"><span class="nm">(q)</span><span class="cl">Version #2 (Beraisa):</span> "Tizbach v'Achalta" teaches that you may benefit (from Pesulei ha'Mukdashim) only after Shechitah;</p>
<p class="bas indent2"><span class="nm">1.</span>This Tana permits redeeming Kodshim to feed them to dogs. (He has no source to forbid.)</p>
<p class="perekline">PEREK YESH B'KODSHEI MIZBE'ACH</p>
<p class="bas subject"><span class="nm">2)</span>STRINGENCIES OF <i>KODSHEI MIZBE'ACH</i></p>
<p class="bas indent1"><span class="nm">(a)</span><span class="cl">(Mishnah):</span> There are stringencies of Kodshei Mizbe'ach over Kodshei Bedek ha'Bayis, and vice-versa. The following apply only to Kodshei Mizbe'ach:</p>
<p class="bas indent2"><span class="nm">1.</span>They make Temurah, one can be liable for them for Pigul, Nosar and Tamei, their Vlados and milk are forbidden after they are redeemed, one who slaughters them outside (the Mikdash) is liable, and they may not be given to workers for wages.</p>
<p class="bas bbbline">31b----------------------------------------31b</p>
<p class="bas indent1"><span class="nm">(b)</span>The following apply only to Bedek ha'Bayis;</p>
<p class="bas indent2"><span class="nm">1.</span>Stam (unspecified) Hekdesh is for Bedek ha'Bayis, Hekdesh to Bedek ha'Bayis takes effect on everything, Me'ilah applies to Giduleihem (what grows from them), and Kohanim do not benefit from them.</p>
<p class="bas indent1"><span class="nm">(c)</span><span class="cl">(Gemara) Question:</span> It is not always true that Kodshei Mizbe'ach make Temurah. Korbanos ha'Of do not!</p>
<p class="bas indent2"><span class="nm">1.</span><span class="cl">(Mishnah):</span> Birds and Menachos do not make Temurah.</p>
<p class="bas indent1"><span class="nm">(d)</span><span class="cl">Answer:</span> The Mishnah refers to animals.</p>
<p class="bas indent1"><span class="nm">(e)</span><span class="cl">Question:</span> Vlados Kodshim are Kodshei Mizbe'ach, but they do not make Temurah!</p>
<p class="bas indent1"><span class="nm">(f)</span><span class="cl">Answer #1:</span> Our Mishnah is R. Yehudah, who says that Vlados Kodshim make Temurah.</p>
<p class="bas indent1"><span class="nm">(g)</span><span class="cl">Question:</span> Temurah is Kodshei Mizbe'ach, but it does not make Temurah!</p>
<p class="bas indent1"><span class="nm">(h)</span><span class="cl">Answer:</span> The Mishnah refers to initial Hekdesh.</p>
<p class="bas indent1"><span class="nm">(i)</span><span class="cl">Answer #2 (to Question (e)):</span> Our Mishnah is even like Chachamim. It refers to initial Hekdesh.</p>
<p class="bas indent1"><span class="nm">(j)</span><span class="cl">(Mishnah):</span> Kodshei Mizbe'ach may not be given to workers for wages.</p>
<p class="bas indent1"><span class="nm">(k)</span><span class="cl">Inference:</span> We may give Bedek ha'Bayis to workers for wages.</p>
<p class="bas indent1"><span class="nm">(l)</span><span class="cl">(R. Avahu):</span> We learn from "v'Asu <i>Li</i> Mikdash" - from My (Hash-m's) property.</p>
<p class="bas subject"><span class="nm">3)</span>STRINGENCIES OF <i>KODSHEI BEDEK HA'BAYIS</i></p>
<p class="bas indent1"><span class="nm">(a)</span><span class="cl">(Mishnah):</span> The following apply only to Kodshei Bedek ha'Bayis - Stam Hekdesh is for Bedek ha'Bayis, (Hekdesh to Bedek ha'Bayis takes effect on everything - Shitah Mekubetzes deletes this from the text).</p>
<p class="bas indent1"><span class="nm">(b)</span><span class="cl">Question:</span> Who is the Tana of the Mishnah?</p>
<p class="bas indent1"><span class="nm">(c)</span><span class="cl">Answer #1 (R. Chiya bar Aba):</span> It is (like R. Eliezer, and) unlike R. Yehoshua:</p>
<p class="bas indent2"><span class="nm">1.</span><span class="cl">(Mishnah - R. Eliezer):</span> If Reuven was Makdish his property and it included Behemos that were valid for Korbanos:</p>
<p class="bas indent3"><span class="nm">i.</span>We sell males to people who need to bring (and will offer them for) Olos. We sell females (similarly) for Shelamim. The money (for both of them) and the rest of his property go to Bedek ha'Bayis;</p>
<p class="bas indent2"><span class="nm">2.</span>R. Yehoshua says, males themselves are offered for Olos;</p>
<p class="bas indent3"><span class="nm">i.</span>We sell females for Shelamim, and the money is used to buy and offer Olos;</p>
<p class="bas indent3"><span class="nm">ii.</span>The rest of his property goes to Bedek ha'Bayis.</p>
<p class="bas indent1"><span class="nm">(d)</span>R. Chiya argues with Rav Ada bar Ahavah;</p>
<p class="bas indent2"><span class="nm">1.</span><span class="cl">Version #1 (Rav Ada):</span> If one was Makdish a herd of all males, all agree that one does not intend to be Makdish to Bedek ha'Bayis something Kosher for the Mizbe'ach. (Rather, they are offered for Olos);</p>
<p class="bas indent2"><span class="nm">2.</span>They argue about a herd of males and females;</p>
<p class="bas indent3"><span class="nm">i.</span>R. Eliezer holds that people make uniform vows. Since the females cannot be Olos, also the males are not Olos;</p>
<p class="bas indent3"><span class="nm">ii.</span>R. Yehoshua holds that people (sometimes) make a vow that is not uniform (it takes effect in different ways).</p>
<p class="bas indent2"><span class="nm">3.</span><span class="cl">Version #2 (Rav Ada):</span> If one was Makdish only animals, all agree that one does not intend to be Makdish to Bedek ha'Bayis in place of the Mizbe'ach;</p>
<p class="bas indent2"><span class="nm">4.</span>They argue when he was Makdish animals <i>and</i> other property;</p>
<p class="bas indent3"><span class="nm">i.</span>R. Eliezer holds that one makes a uniform vow. since the other property is not for the Mizbe'ach, also the animals are not;</p>
<p class="bas indent3"><span class="nm">ii.</span>R. Yehoshua holds that people make a vow that is not uniform.</p>
<p class="bas indent1"><span class="nm">(e)</span><span class="cl">Question (Mishnah - R. Eliezer):</span> Their money (of the animals) and the rest of his property go to Bedek ha'Bayis;</p>
<p class="bas indent2"><span class="nm">1.</span>Granted, according to Version #2, we understand why it discusses other property, for R. Eliezer argues only when there is other property;</p>
<p class="bas indent2"><span class="nm">2.</span>However, according to Version #1, why does it mention other property? It does not affect the argument!</p>
<p class="bas indent1"><span class="nm">(f)</span><span class="cl">Answer:</span> Indeed, it should say (only), "their money goes to Bedek ha'Bayis."</p>
<p class="bas indent1"><span class="nm">(g)</span><span class="cl">(Mishnah):</span> Hekdesh Bedek ha'Bayis takes effect on everything.</p>
<p class="bas indent1"><span class="nm">(h)</span><span class="cl">Question:</span> What does this include?</p>
<p class="bas indent1"><span class="nm">(i)</span><span class="cl">Answer (Ravina):</span> It includes sawdust and fallen leaves.</p>
<p class="bas indent1"><span class="nm">(j)</span><span class="cl">(Mishnah):</span> Me'ilah applies to Giduleihem.</p>
<p class="bas indent1"><span class="nm">(k)</span><span class="cl">Question:</span> What does this exclude? (Tosfos)</p>
<p class="bas indent1"><span class="nm">(l)</span><span class="cl">Answer (Rav Papa):</span> It excludes (Kodshei Mizbe'ach, e.g.) milk of Korbanos and eggs of Torim:</p>
<p class="bas indent2"><span class="nm">1.</span><span class="cl">(Mishnah):</span> We may not benefit from milk of Korbanos and eggs of Torim. Me'ilah does not apply to them.</p>
<p class="bas indent2"><span class="nm">2.</span>This applies to Kodshei Mizbe'ach, but Me'ilah applies to eggs (such as those) of a chicken and milk of a donkey of Bedek ha'Bayis.</p>
<p class="bas indent2"><span class="nm">3.</span>Even according to the opinion that Me'ilah applies to Gidulei Kodshei Mizbe'ach, that is only for things that are Kosher for the Mizbe'ach (e.g. Vlados Kodshim).</p>
