<p class="bas subject"><span class="nm">1)</span><i>MISHNAH:</i> THE FOUR JUDGMENTS OF THE YEAR</p>
<p class="bas indent1"><span class="nm">(a)</span>On Pesach, judgment is passed concerning produce.</p>
<p class="bas indent1"><span class="nm">(b)</span>On Shavuos, judgment is passed concerning fruit.</p>
<p class="bas indent1"><span class="nm">(c)</span>On Rosh Hashanah, all the world passes like Bnei Maron for Judgment.</p>
<p class="bas indent1"><span class="nm">(d)</span>On Sukos, judgment is passed concerning water.</p>
<p class="bas subject"><span class="nm">2)</span>THE JUDGMENT OF PRODUCE</p>
<p class="bas indent1"><span class="nm">(a)</span><span class="cl">Question:</span> Which produce is being judged?</p>
<p class="bas indent2"><span class="nm">1.</span><span class="cl">Answer:</span> The produce presently in the fields.</p>
<p class="bas indent2"><span class="nm">2.</span><span class="cl">Question:</span> When was judgment passed for the things that happened to it until now?</p>
<p class="bas indent1"><span class="nm">(b)</span><span class="cl">Answer:</span> It refers to the produce that is due to be sown.</p>
<p class="bas indent1"><span class="nm">(c)</span><span class="cl">Question:</span> This implies that one judgment is passed for each crop, but we see otherwise in a Beraisa:</p>
<p class="bas indent2"><span class="nm">1.</span>If calamity befalls a crop before Pesach, it was decided in the previous year.</p>
<p class="bas indent2"><span class="nm">2.</span>If it happens after Pesach, it was decided this year.</p>
<p class="bas indent2"><span class="nm">3.</span>If calamity befalls a person before Yom Kipur, it was decided in the previous year.</p>
<p class="bas indent2"><span class="nm">4.</span>If it happens after Yom Kipur, it was decided this year.</p>
<p class="bas indent1"><span class="nm">(d)</span><span class="cl">Answer (Rava):</span> Two judgments are passed on each crop.</p>
<p class="bas indent1"><span class="nm">(e)</span><span class="cl">(Abayey):</span> Therefore, if a person sees his slow crops doing well, he should quickly plant some fast-growing crops (as it is a year of a good verdict).</p>
<p class="bas subject"><span class="nm">3)</span>THE AUTHORSHIP OF THE <i>MISHNAH</i></p>
<p class="bas indent1"><span class="nm">(a)</span><span class="cl">Question:</span> Who does the Mishnah follow?</p>
<p class="bas indent2"><span class="nm">1.</span>The Gemara cites four opinions in a Beraisa that differ from the Mishnah:</p>
<p class="bas indent3"><span class="nm">i.</span>(R. Meir) Everything is judged on Rosh Hashanah and the verdicts are sealed on Yom Kipur.</p>
<p class="bas indent3"><span class="nm">ii.</span><span class="cl">(R. Yehudah):</span> Everything is judged on Rosh Hashanah and the verdicts are sealed on different dates; Pesach for produce, Shavuos for fruit, Sukos for water and Yom Kipur for man.</p>
<p class="bas indent3"><span class="nm">iii.</span><span class="cl">(R. Yosi):</span> Man is judged every day, as derived from a Pasuk.</p>
<p class="bas indent3"><span class="nm">iv.</span><span class="cl">(R. Nosson):</span> Man is judged every moment, as derived from Pasuk.</p>
<p class="bas indent1"><span class="nm">(b)</span><span class="cl">Answer:</span> The Mishnah follows R. Yehudah and is referring to the verdicts.</p>
<p class="bas indent1"><span class="nm">(c)</span><span class="cl">Question:</span> The Mishnah sets the date for man as Rosh Hashanah (not Yom Kipur)!?</p>
<p class="bas indent1"><span class="nm">(d)</span><span class="cl">Answer (Rava):</span> The Mishnah refers to the beginning of the judgment process and follows Tana d'Bei R. Yishmael:</p>
<p class="bas indent2"><span class="nm">1.</span>On Pesach, judgment is passed concerning produce.</p>
<p class="bas indent2"><span class="nm">2.</span>On Shavuos, judgment is passed concerning fruit.</p>
<p class="bas indent2"><span class="nm">3.</span>On Sukos, judgment is passed concerning water.</p>
<p class="bas indent2"><span class="nm">4.</span>Man is judged on Rosh Hashanah and his verdict is sealed on Yom Kipur.</p>
<p class="bas subject"><span class="nm">4)</span>THE JUDGMENT OF MAN</p>
<p class="bas indent1"><span class="nm">(a)</span><span class="cl">Question (R. Chisda):</span> What is the reason of R. Yosi (that man is judged every day)?</p>
<p class="bas indent2"><span class="nm">1.</span><span class="cl">Answer:</span> He gave a Pasuk as his reason!?</p>
<p class="bas indent2"><span class="nm">2.</span><span class="cl">Question:</span> Why didn't he say the same as R. Nosson?</p>
<p class="bas indent2"><span class="nm">3.</span><span class="cl">Answer:</span> R. Nosson's Pasuk is only referring to Hash-m studying man.</p>
<p class="bas indent2"><span class="nm">4.</span><span class="cl">Question:</span> The same could be said for R. Yosi's Pasuk!?</p>
<p class="bas indent1"><span class="nm">(b)</span><span class="cl">Answer (R. Chisda):</span> R. Yosi's source is a Pasuk that speaks of daily judgment.</p>
<p class="bas indent2"><span class="nm">1.</span>This Pasuk also teaches us that a king is judged before his people.</p>
<p class="bas indent2"><span class="nm">2.</span>The reason is that it is improper for him to have to wait in line.</p>
<p class="bas indent2"><span class="nm">3.</span>Alternately, the reason is that he should be judged before the Judge grows angry.</p>
<p class="bas indent1"><span class="nm">(c)</span><span class="cl">(R. Yosef):</span> Our daily prayer for the sick is in accordance with R. Yosi's view that man is judged daily.</p>
<p class="bas indent2"><span class="nm">1.</span>Alternately, it follows the Rabanan, in accordance with R. Yitzchak's view that prayer helps even after a verdict has been passed.</p>
<p class="bas indent1"><span class="nm">(d)</span><span class="cl">(R. Yehudah citing R. Akiva):</span> The Omer is brought on Pesach to influence the judgment for the crops which takes place at that time.</p>
<p class="bas indent2"><span class="nm">1.</span>The Two Loaves are brought on Shavuos to influence the judgment for fruit which takes place at that time.</p>
<p class="bas indent2"><span class="nm">2.</span>The water-libation takes place on Sukos to influence the judgment for rains which takes place at that time.</p>
<p class="bas indent2"><span class="nm">3.</span>On Rosh Hashanah we say Malchuyos to accept Hash-m's sovereignty, Zichronos to raise a remembrance of us before Him, with the aid of the Shofar (Shofaros).</p>
<p class="bas subject"><span class="nm">5)</span>SHOFAR</p>
<p class="bas indent1"><span class="nm">(a)</span><span class="cl">(R. Avahu):</span> We use a ram's horn for a Shofar to allude to the Akeidah of Yitzchak.</p>
<p class="bas indent2"><span class="nm">1.</span>Hash-m then considers it as though we bound ourselves in an Akeidah.</p>
<p class="bas indent1"><span class="nm">(b)</span><span class="cl">Question (R. Yizchak):</span> Why do we blow Shofar on Rosh Hashanah?</p>
<p class="bas indent2"><span class="nm">1.</span><span class="cl">Answer:</span> Because the Torah said so!</p>
<p class="bas indent2"><span class="nm">2.</span><span class="cl">Question:</span> Rather, why do we blow a Teru'ah?</p>
<p class="bas indent2"><span class="nm">3.</span><span class="cl">Answer:</span> Because the Torah said so!</p>
<p class="bas indent2"><span class="nm">4.</span><span class="cl">Question:</span> Rather, why do we blow Teki'ah and Teru'ah both before and during the Amidah?</p>
<p class="bas indent1"><span class="nm">(c)</span><span class="cl">Answer:</span> Doing the mitzvah twice confounds the Satan.</p>
<p class="bas bbbline">16b----------------------------------------16b</p>
<p class="bas indent1"><span class="nm">(d)</span><span class="cl">(R. Yitzchak):</span> Any year where Shofar was not blown at its beginning will suffer misfortune at its end.</p>
<p class="bas indent2"><span class="nm">1.</span>The reason is that the Satan was not confounded.</p>
<p class="bas subject"><span class="nm">6)</span>R. YITZCHAK'S STATEMENTS ON JUDGMENT AND FESTIVALS</p>
<p class="bas indent1"><span class="nm">(a)</span><span class="cl">(R. Yitzchak):</span> in any year where the people humbled themselves at the beginning, they will prosper at its end, as derived from a Pasuk.</p>
<p class="bas indent1"><span class="nm">(b)</span>A person is judged according to his deeds at that time, as derived from a Pasuk about Yishmael.</p>
<p class="bas indent1"><span class="nm">(c)</span>Three things remind Hash-m of a person's sins:</p>
<p class="bas indent2"><span class="nm">1.</span>If he walks under a collapsing wall;</p>
<p class="bas indent2"><span class="nm">2.</span>If he is confident in the power of his prayer;</p>
<p class="bas indent2"><span class="nm">3.</span>If he calls on Hash-m to judge his case against another.</p>
<p class="bas indent3"><span class="nm">i.</span><span class="cl">(R. Chanan):</span> Anyone who calls on Hash-m to judge their case against another is themselves punished first, as derived from Sarah.</p>
<p class="bas indent1"><span class="nm">(d)</span>Four things tear up the verdict against a person:</p>
<p class="bas indent2"><span class="nm">1.</span>Charity, as derived from a Pasuk;</p>
<p class="bas indent2"><span class="nm">2.</span>Crying out in prayer, as derived from a Pasuk;</p>
<p class="bas indent2"><span class="nm">3.</span>Changing one's name, as derived from a Pasuk about Sarai/Sarah;</p>
<p class="bas indent2"><span class="nm">4.</span>Changing one's ways, as derived from the episode of Ninveih.</p>
<p class="bas indent2"><span class="nm">5.</span>Some add - changing one's place of residence;</p>
<p class="bas indent3"><span class="nm">i.</span>This is derived from Avraham moving to Eretz Yisrael to become a great nation.</p>
<p class="bas indent3"><span class="nm">ii.</span>Others attribute that to the merit of Eretz Yisrael.</p>
<p class="bas indent1"><span class="nm">(e)</span>A person must greet his teacher on all festive days, as derived from a Pasuk.</p>
<p class="bas indent1"><span class="nm">(f)</span>A person must purify himself before each festival, as derived from a Pasuk.</p>
<p class="bas indent2"><span class="nm">1.</span><span class="cl">(Beraisa):</span> The Pasuk prohibits touching a dead Treife animal.</p>
<p class="bas indent2"><span class="nm">2.</span>It can't be referring to a general ban even for Yisraelim, as they aren't even prohibited from stringent Tum'ah.</p>
<p class="bas indent2"><span class="nm">3.</span>It must be referring to a requirement to purify oneself before a festival.</p>
<p class="bas subject"><span class="nm">7)</span>THE BOOKS OF JUDGMENT</p>
<p class="bas indent1"><span class="nm">(a)</span><span class="cl">(R. Kruspada'i citing R. Yochanan):</span> Three books are opened on Rosh Hashanah:</p>
<p class="bas indent2"><span class="nm">1.</span>That of the utterly righteous - who are signed and sealed immediately for life;</p>
<p class="bas indent2"><span class="nm">2.</span>That of the utterly wicked - who are signed and sealed immediately for death;</p>
<p class="bas indent2"><span class="nm">3.</span>That of intermediate people - whose fate is undecided until Yom Kipur.</p>
<p class="bas indent3"><span class="nm">i.</span>If they merit it, they are signed for life;</p>
<p class="bas indent3"><span class="nm">ii.</span>Otherwise, they are signed for death.</p>
<p class="bas indent1"><span class="nm">(b)</span><span class="cl">(R. Avin):</span> This is all derived from a Pasuk (as cited).</p>
<p class="bas indent1"><span class="nm">(c)</span><span class="cl">(R. Nachman bar Yitzchak):</span> It is derived from a different Pasuk (as cited).</p>
<p class="bas subject"><span class="nm">8)</span>THE <i>BERAISA </i>OF PEOPLES' JUDGMENTS</p>
<p class="bas indent1"><span class="nm">(a)</span><span class="cl">(Beis Shamai):</span> There are three groups of people on the day of judgment:</p>
<p class="bas indent2"><span class="nm">1.</span>The utterly righteous are signed and sealed immediately for eternal life;</p>
<p class="bas indent2"><span class="nm">2.</span>The utterly wicked are signed and sealed immediately for Gehinom;</p>
<p class="bas indent2"><span class="nm">3.</span>Intermediate people descend to Gehinom, cry out and emerge, as derived from a Pasuk.</p>
<p class="bas indent3"><span class="nm">i.</span><span class="cl">(Beis Hillel):</span> Hash-m tilts the scales in their favor (so they avoid Gehinom).</p>
