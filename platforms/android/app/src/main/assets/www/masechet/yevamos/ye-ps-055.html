<div class="subject"><span class="nm">1)</span><p>THE <i>ISUR</i> OF <i>ACHOS</i> <i>ISHTO</i> (cont.)</p></div>
<div class="indent1"><span class="nm">(a)</span><p><span class="cl">Answer #1:</span> We learn from Achoso. Just like one's paternal and maternal sisters are forbidden, also both sisters of one's wife are forbidden.</p></div>
<div class="indent2"><span class="nm">1.</span><p><span class="cl">Question:</span> Why don't we learn from Dodaso, that only the paternal sister is forbidden?</p></div>
<div class="indent2"><span class="nm">2.</span><p><span class="cl">Answer:</span> It is more reasonable to learn from Achoso, since this Isur is due to himself, just like Achos Ishto.</p></div>
<div class="indent2"><span class="nm">3.</span><p><span class="cl">Objection:</span> It is better to learn from Dodaso, for the Isur comes through Kidushin, just like Achos Ishto!</p></div>
<div class="indent1"><span class="nm">(b)</span><p><span class="cl">Answer #2:</span> Rather, we learn from Eshes Ach, since this Isur is due to himself and comes through Kidushin.</p></div>
<div class="indent1"><span class="nm">(c)</span><p><span class="cl">Question:</span> What is the source regarding Eshes Ach?</p></div>
<div class="indent1"><span class="nm">(d)</span><p><span class="cl">Answer (Beraisa):</span> "Ervas Eshes Achicha" is forbidden, for paternal and maternal brothers.</p></div>
<div class="indent2"><span class="nm">1.</span><p><span class="cl">Question:</span> Perhaps it applies only to paternal brothers!</p></div>
<div class="indent3"><span class="nm">i.</span><p><span class="cl">Suggestion #1:</span> Just like the Isur Achoso applies to paternal and maternal sisters, also here.</p></div>
<div class="indent3"><span class="nm">ii.</span><p><span class="cl">Suggestion #2:</span> Or, perhaps we should learn from Dodaso, and only the paternal brother is included!</p></div>
<div class="indent3"><span class="nm">iii.</span><p><span class="cl">Decision:</span> We should learn from the more similar case.</p></div>
<div class="indent3"><span class="nm">iv.</span><p><span class="cl">Suggestion #1:</span> It is better to learn from Achoso (his own relative) and not from Dodaso, who is his father's relative.</p></div>
<div class="indent3"><span class="nm">v.</span><p><span class="cl">Suggestion #2:</span> Perhaps it is better to learn from Dodaso, since this also comes through Kidushin, and not from Achoso!</p></div>
<div class="indent2"><span class="nm">2.</span><p><span class="cl">Answer:</span> We include a maternal brother from "Ervas Achicha Hi" (the end of the verse; it is extra).</p></div>
<div class="indent1"><span class="nm">(e)</span><p><span class="cl">Question:</span> Perhaps only a paternal brother's wife is forbidden, and the extra verse is needed to teach, when he has children, she is forbidden in the life of his brother and after his death!</p></div>
<div class="indent1"><span class="nm">(f)</span><p><span class="cl">Answer:</span> If he has children, we already know that she is forbidden after he dies. Since the Torah permits Yibum when he has no children, we infer that when he has children, she is forbidden!</p></div>
<div class="indent1"><span class="nm">(g)</span><p><span class="cl">Suggestion #1:</span> Perhaps when he has no children, she is permitted to the Yavam and forbidden to all others. When he has children, she is permitted to all!</p></div>
<div class="indent1"><span class="nm">(h)</span><p><span class="cl">Suggestion #2:</span> Perhaps when he has no children, Yibum is a Mitzvah. When he has children, it is optional!</p></div>
<div class="indent1"><span class="nm">(i)</span><p><span class="cl">Suggestion #3:</span> Perhaps when he has no children, Yibum is permitted. When he has children, it is forbidden, and the Isur is derived from a Mitzvas Aseh and is only a Chayavei Aseh!</p></div>
<div class="indent1"><span class="nm">(j)</span><p><span class="cl">Rejection:</span> "Ervas Achiv Gilah (Aririm Yihyu)" (this is extra to teach about after the brother died. Aririm (having no children) alludes to Kares.)</p></div>
<div class="indent1"><span class="nm">(k)</span><p><span class="cl">Suggestion:</span> Perhaps a maternal brother's wife is like a paternal brother's wife, and is permitted after death!</p></div>
<div class="indent1"><span class="nm">(l)</span><p><span class="cl">Rejection:</span> "She is" - she remains forbidden.</p></div>
<div class="subject"><span class="nm">2)</span><p>EXTRA MENTIONS OF KARES AND ARIRI</p></div>
<div class="indent1"><span class="nm">(a)</span><p><span class="cl">Question:</span> Why did the Torah mention Kares regarding a sister (all Arayos are Chayavei Kerisos)?</p></div>
<div class="indent1"><span class="nm">(b)</span><p><span class="cl">Answer #1:</span> This teaches R. Yochanan's law:</p></div>
<div class="indent2"><span class="nm">1.</span><p><span class="cl">(R. Yochanan):</span> If one had Bi'ah with all the Arayos b'Shogeg, he brings a Korban for each one.</p></div>
<div class="indent1"><span class="nm">(c)</span><p><span class="cl">Answer #2 (R. Yitzchak):</span> Even though one is normally lashed for Chayavei Lavin, Kares was written regarding one's sister to teach that the punishment for Chayavei Kerisus is Kares and not lashes.</p></div>
<div class="indent1"><span class="nm">(d)</span><p><span class="cl">Question:</span> From where does R. Yitzchak learn R. Yochanan's law?</p></div>
<div class="indent1"><span class="nm">(e)</span><p><span class="cl">Answer:</span> "<i>V'El Ishah</i> b'Tum'as Nidasah", obligates for each woman.</p></div>
<div class="indent1"><span class="nm">(f)</span><p><span class="cl">Question:</span> Why did the Torah write regarding Dodaso "They will be childless"?</p></div>
<div class="indent1"><span class="nm">(g)</span><p><span class="cl">Answer - Contradiction:</span> It says "They will be childless", and it says "They will die childless"!</p></div>
<div class="indent2"><span class="nm">1.</span><p><span class="cl">Answer (Rabah):</span> If he has children (when he sinned), he will bury them; if he had no children, he will die childless.</p></div>
<div class="indent1"><span class="nm">(h)</span><p>It was needed to write both:</p></div>
<div class="indent2"><span class="nm">1.</span><p>Had the Torah written only "They will be childless", one might have thought that children he had before sinning will die, but not children after the sin;</p></div>
<div class="indent2"><span class="nm">2.</span><p>Had the Torah written only "They will die childless", one might have thought that he will not have children after the sin, but children born before the sin will not die!</p></div>
<div class="subject"><span class="nm">3)</span><p>HA'ARA'AH IS CONSIDERED LIKE BI'AH</p></div>
<div class="indent1"><span class="nm">(a)</span><p><span class="cl">Question:</span> What is the source that Ha'ara'ah is considered like Bi'ah regarding Chayavei Lavin?</p></div>
<div class="indent1"><span class="nm">(b)</span><p><span class="cl">Answer:</span> Regarding a Shifchah Charufah (a Kena'anis slave or half-slave designated to an Eved Ivri) it says "Shichvas Zera" (one is liable only for a full Bi'ah, which can lead to semen). This implies that other Chayavei Lavin are liable for Ha'ara'ah.</p></div>
<div class="indent1"><span class="nm">(c)</span><p><span class="cl">Question:</span> Perhaps we should learn contrarily! Since the Torah revealed that Chayavei Kerisus are liable for Ha'ara'ah, Chayavei Lavin are liable only for full Bi'ah!</p></div>
<div class="indent1"><span class="nm">(d)</span><p><span class="cl">Answer (Rav Ashi):</span> If so, the Torah would not have needed to teach that Shifchah Charufah is liable only for full Bi'ah.</p></div>
<div class="indent1"><span class="nm">(e)</span><p><span class="cl">Question:</span> What is the source that Ha'ara'ah is like Bi'ah regarding Chayavei Lavin of Kehunah?</p></div>
<div class="indent1"><span class="nm">(f)</span><p><span class="cl">Answer:</span> We learn from a Gezeirah Shavah "Kichah-Kichah".</p></div>
<div class="indent1"><span class="nm">(g)</span><p><span class="cl">Question:</span> What is the source that Ha'ara'ah is considered like Bi'ah regarding Chayavei Aseh?</p></div>
<div class="bbbline">55b----------------------------------------55b</p></div>
<div class="indent1"><span class="nm">(h)</span><p><span class="cl">Answer:</span> We learn from a Gezeirah Shavah "Bi'ah-Bi'ah".</p></div>
<div class="indent1"><span class="nm">(i)</span><p><span class="cl">Question:</span> What is the source that a Yevamah who has Bi'ah with a stranger is liable for Ha'ara'ah?</p></div>
<div class="indent1"><span class="nm">(j)</span><p><span class="cl">Objection:</span> Amora'im (49b) argue about whether this is Chayavei Lavin or Chayavei Aseh. In either case; we gave the source above!</p></div>
<div class="indent1"><span class="nm">(k)</span><p><span class="cl">Correction:</span> Rather, how do we know Ha'ara'ah is like full Bi'ah to acquire a Yevamah?</p></div>
<div class="indent1"><span class="nm">(l)</span><p><span class="cl">Answer:</span> We learn from a Gezeirah Shavah "Bi'ah-Bi'ah".</p></div>
<div class="indent1"><span class="nm">(m)</span><p><span class="cl">Question:</span> How do we know that Ha'ara'ah is like Bi'ah to make Kidushin?</p></div>
<div class="indent1"><span class="nm">(n)</span><p><span class="cl">Answer:</span> We learn from a Gezeirah Shavah, "Kichah-Kichah".</p></div>
<div class="indent1"><span class="nm">(o)</span><p><span class="cl">Question (Rava):</span> The Torah writes "Shichvas Zera" regarding Shifchah Charufah, Eshes Ish, and Sotah. Why are all of these needed?</p></div>
<div class="indent1"><span class="nm">(p)</span><p><span class="cl">Answer - part 1:</span> We taught about Shifchah above;</p></div>
<div class="indent1"><span class="nm">(q)</span><p><span class="cl">Answer #1 - part 2:</span> Regarding Eshes Ish, it excludes Bi'ah with Ever Mes (without Kishuy).</p></div>
<div class="indent1"><span class="nm">(r)</span><p><span class="cl">Question:</span> This is like the opinion that exempts Bi'as Arayos with Ever Mes. According to the opinion that Bi'ah with an Ever Mes is liable regarding Arayos, how can we answer?</p></div>
<div class="indent1"><span class="nm">(s)</span><p><span class="cl">Answer #2 - part 2:</span> It excludes Bi'ah with a married woman who died;</p></div>
<div class="indent2"><span class="nm">1.</span><p>One might have thought that since she is still considered 'She'er' after death, one is liable for her. The verse teaches that this is not so.</p></div>
<div class="indent1"><span class="nm">(t)</span><p><span class="cl">Answer - part 3:</span> A Beraisa teaches why it says "Shichvas Zera" regarding a Sotah:</p></div>
<div class="indent2"><span class="nm">1.</span><p><span class="cl">(Beraisa):</span> "Shichvas Zera" excludes something else.</p></div>
<div class="indent2"><span class="nm">2.</span><p><span class="cl">Question:</span> What does this refer to?</p></div>
<div class="indent2"><span class="nm">3.</span><p><span class="cl">Answer #1 (Rav Sheshes):</span> It excludes one who warned his wife against Bi'ah Lo k'Darkah.</p></div>
<div class="indent2"><span class="nm">4.</span><p><span class="cl">Objection (Rava):</span> It says "<i>Mishkevei</i> Ishah" (plural, to include Lo k'Darkah)!</p></div>
<div class="indent2"><span class="nm">5.</span><p><span class="cl">Answer #2 (Rava):</span> It excludes warning against intimacy other than Bi'ah.</p></div>
<div class="indent2"><span class="nm">6.</span><p><span class="cl">Objection (Abaye):</span> Did the Torah really forbid [a wife to her husband due to] mere lewdness?!</p></div>
<div class="indent2"><span class="nm">7.</span><p><span class="cl">Answer #3 (Abaye):</span> It excludes warning against Neshikah (touching of the genitals).</p></div>
<div class="indent2"><span class="nm">8.</span><p><span class="cl">Objection:</span> This is like the opinion that Ha'ara'ah is entrance of the crown (of the Ever). According to the opinion that says that it is Neshikah, how can we answer?</p></div>
<div class="indent2"><span class="nm">9.</span><p><span class="cl">Defense (of Answer #2):</span> Really, it excludes warning against intimacy other than Bi'ah. One would have thought that everything depends on the whims of the husband, and he is insistent on this (so it is valid warning). The verse teaches that this is not so.</p></div>
<div class="subject"><span class="nm">4)</span><p>WHAT IS HA'ARA'AH?</p></div>
<div class="indent1"><span class="nm">(a)</span><p><span class="cl">(Shmuel):</span> Ha'ara'ah is Neshikah.</p></div>
<div class="indent2"><span class="nm">1.</span><p>This is like one who puts his finger on his mouth. Perforce, it will make some indentation.</p></div>
<div class="indent1"><span class="nm">(b)</span><p><span class="cl">(Rabah bar bar Chanah citing R. Yochanan):</span> The Torah is Mechayev for full Bi'ah with a Shifchah Charufah. This is entrance of the crown.</p></div>
<div class="indent1"><span class="nm">(c)</span><p><span class="cl">Question (Rav Sheshes - Beraisa):</span> He is liable only for a Bi'ah of Miruk.</p></div>
<div class="indent2"><span class="nm">1.</span><p><span class="cl">Suggestion:</span> This is when he fully enters the Ever (Tosfos; Rashi - he empties the Ever of its semen)!</p></div>
<div class="indent1"><span class="nm">(d)</span><p><span class="cl">Answer:</span> No, he fully enters the crown.</p></div>
<div class="indent1"><span class="nm">(e)</span><p><span class="cl">(Rav Dimi citing R. Yochanan):</span> Ha'ara'ah is the entrance of the crown.</p></div>
<div class="indent2"><span class="nm">1.</span><p><span class="cl">Talmidim:</span> Rabah bar bar Chanah said otherwise in R. Yochanan's name!</p></div>
<div class="indent2"><span class="nm">2.</span><p><span class="cl">Rav Dimi:</span> Either he is a liar, or I am!</p></div>
<div class="indent1"><span class="nm">(f)</span><p><span class="cl">(Ravin, citing R. Yochanan):</span> Ha'ara'ah is the entrance of the crown.</p></div>
<div class="indent1"><span class="nm">(g)</span><p>He certainly disagrees with Rabah bar bar Chanah.</p></div>
<div class="indent1"><span class="nm">(h)</span><p><span class="cl">Question:</span> Must we say that he disagrees with Shmuel?</p></div>
<div class="indent1"><span class="nm">(i)</span><p><span class="cl">Answer:</span> No. From Neshikah until entrance of the crown he calls Ha'ara'ah.</p></div>
<div class="indent1"><span class="nm">(j)</span><p><span class="cl">(Rav Shmuel bar Yehudah citing R. Yochanan):</span> Ha'ara'ah is the entrance of the crown. Full Bi'ah is literally full Bi'ah. Less than this is only Neshikah, and one is exempt for this.</p></div>
<div class="indent1"><span class="nm">(k)</span><p>He disagrees with Shmuel.</p></div>
