<p class="bas subject"><span class="nm">1)</span>THE PROHIBITION TO ANOINT</p>
<p class="bas indent1"><span class="nm">(a)</span><span class="cl">(Rav Ika brei d'Rav Ami):</span> They are consistent with what they said elsewhere:</p>
<p class="bas indent2"><span class="nm">1.</span><span class="cl">(Mishnah - R. Meir):</span> If a Bas Kohen was married to a Yisrael, and she ate Terumah, she pays its value. She does not add a fifth. She is burned (for Zenus, i.e. extramarital relations);</p>
<p class="bas indent2"><span class="nm">2.</span>If she was married to someone forbidden (to her), she adds a fifth (for Terumah, like a Zar), and she is not burned.</p>
<p class="bas indent2"><span class="nm">3.</span>Chachamim say, in both cases she does not add a fifth, and she is burned.</p>
<p class="bas indent1"><span class="nm">(b)</span><span class="cl">(Rav Yosef):</span> They argue about Nesinah of Shemen ha'Mishchah, like we explained above, but all agree that the Shi'ur of Nesinah for other Mitzvos is a k'Zayis.</p>
<p class="bas indent1"><span class="nm">(c)</span><span class="cl">(A reciter of Beraisos - Beraisa):</span> If one is commanded not to anoint, others may not anoint him.</p>
<p class="bas indent1"><span class="nm">(d)</span><span class="cl">R. Elazar:</span> That is correct. "(Lo) Yisach" (will not be anointed) is written with two "Yudim," we can re-arrange them to say "(Lo) Yasich" (will not anoint).</p>
<p class="bas indent1"><span class="nm">(e)</span><span class="cl">Question (R. Chananyah):</span> What is the source that if a Kohen Gadol was anointed and took oil from his head and put it on his stomach, he is liable?</p>
<p class="bas indent1"><span class="nm">(f)</span><span class="cl">Answer:</span> "Al Basar Adam Lo Yisach" refers to any Adam (even if he is not a Zar. Torah Temimah suggests that the Chiyuv is for Me'ilah, because the Halachah follows R. Yehudah, who exempts one who anoints a Kohen.)</p>
<p class="bas indent1"><span class="nm">(g)</span><span class="cl">Question (Rav Acha brei d'Rava):</span> Why is this different than the following?</p>
<p class="bas indent2"><span class="nm">1.</span><span class="cl">(Beraisa):</span> If a Kohen anointed himself with Terumah oil, his grandson (or any Zar) may rub himself on him (thereby anointing himself).</p>
<p class="bas indent1"><span class="nm">(h)</span><span class="cl">Answer (Rav Ashi):</span> Regarding Terumah it says "u'Mesu Vo Ki Yechaleluhu" - once it was profaned, it is not Kodesh (nor forbidden);</p>
<p class="bas indent2"><span class="nm">1.</span>Regarding Shemen ha'Mishchah it says "Ki Nezer Shemen Mishchas Elokav Alav" - even when it is on him, it is still called Shemen ha'Mishchah. It was not profaned.</p>
<p class="bas subject"><span class="nm">2)</span>EXEMPTIONS FROM <i>ASHAM TALUY</i></p>
<p class="bas indent1"><span class="nm">(a)</span><span class="cl">(Mishnah):</span> If one transgresses any of these b'Mezid... (except for a Tamei who ate Kodshim or entered the Mikdash).</p>
<p class="bas indent1"><span class="nm">(b)</span><span class="cl">Question:</span> Which law does not apply to Tum'as Mikdash or Kodshav?</p>
<p class="bas indent1"><span class="nm">(c)</span><span class="cl">Answer:</span> Asham Taluy does not apply (since b'Shogeg he would not bring Chatas Kavu'ah (i.e. even an Oni brings an animal), rather, Oleh v'Yored (a rich person brings an animal, and an Oni brings birds, and in such a case a flour offering).</p>
<p class="bas indent1"><span class="nm">(d)</span><span class="cl">Question:</span> The Mishnah should also exclude one who doubtfully sinned before Yom Kipur. He is exempt from Asham Taluy after Yom Kipur!</p>
<p class="bas indent1"><span class="nm">(e)</span><span class="cl">Answer #1 (Reish Lakish):</span> The Mishnah lists those who sin is intact (but are exempt). After Yom Kipur, a doubtful sin was wiped away!</p>
<p class="bas indent1"><span class="nm">(f)</span><span class="cl">Answer #2 (R. Yochanan):</span> The Mishnah discusses one who is Meva'et in (Shitah's text - does not want) the Kaparah of Yom Kipur. (Aruch la'Ner - R. Yochanan says this to explain why the Mishnah does not also exempt eating or doing Melachah on Yom Kipur from Asham Taluy.)</p>
<p class="bas indent2"><span class="nm">1.</span>If he wants Kaparah after Yom Kipur, he must bring an Asham Taluy.</p>
<p class="bas indent2"><span class="nm">2.</span>Reish Lakish holds that Yom Kipur atones even for one who is Meva'et b'Kaparah.</p>
<p class="bas indent1"><span class="nm">(g)</span>Their argument is just like (R. Gershom; Tosfos - resembles) the argument of Abaye and Rava:</p>
<p class="bas indent2"><span class="nm">1.</span><span class="cl">(Abaye):</span> If one says "my Korban Chatas should not atone for me," it does not atone for him;</p>
<p class="bas indent2"><span class="nm">2.</span><span class="cl">(Rava):</span> It atones for him.</p>
<p class="bas indent2"><span class="nm">3.</span>If he said that it should not be offered, all agree that it does not atone. "Yakriv Oso" teaches that it must be with his consent. <span class="note">(<span class="notewd">Note:</span> this verse (Vayikra 1:3) refers to an Olah. Our Gemara understands that it applies also to Chatas.)</span></p>
<p class="bas indent3"><span class="nm">i.</span>They argue about one who said that it should be offered, but should not atone;</p>
<p class="bas indent3"><span class="nm">ii.</span>Abaye holds that it does not atone, because he does not want it to atone;</p>
<p class="bas indent3"><span class="nm">iii.</span>Rava holds that since he authorized offering it, it atones automatically.</p>
<p class="bas indent1"><span class="nm">(h)</span>Rava retracted due to a Beraisa. (Tosfos - we know that he heard it, for he explains it below.)</p>
<p class="bas indent1"><span class="nm">(i)</span><span class="cl">(Beraisa #1) Suggestion:</span> Perhaps Yom Kipur atones for Shavim (those who repent) and Einam Shavim (who do not repent)!</p>
<p class="bas indent2"><span class="nm">1.</span><span class="cl">Question:</span> A Kal va'Chomer refutes this. Chatas and Asham Mechaper, like Yom Kipur;</p>
<p class="bas indent3"><span class="nm">i.</span>Just like Chatas and Asham atone only for Shavim, also Yom Kipur!</p>
<p class="bas indent2"><span class="nm">2.</span><span class="cl">Answer:</span> No. You cannot learn from Chatas and Asham, which do not atone for Mezid, to Yom Kipur, which atones for Mezid! (Rashi - really, we asked only from Chatas, for Asham often atones for Mezid. Tosfos - we can ask also from Asham, it does not atone for Chayavei Kerisus like Yom Kipur does. Alternatively, Yom Kipur atones for any Aveirah b'Mezid, unlike Chatas or Asham);</p>
<p class="bas indent3"><span class="nm">i.</span>Since Yom Kipur atones for Mezid, perhaps it also atones for Einam Shavim.</p>
<p class="bas indent1"><span class="nm">(j)</span><span class="cl">Rejection:</span> "Ach" is Mechalek (distinguishes. It atones only for Shavim.)</p>
<p class="bas indent1"><span class="nm">(k)</span><span class="cl">Question:</span> What is the meaning of "Shavim and Einam Shavim"?</p>
<p class="bas indent2"><span class="nm">1.</span><span class="cl">Suggestion:</span> Shavim are those who sinned b'Shogeg (had they known that it was forbidden, they would have been Shav (refrained)); Einam Shavim are those who sinned b'Mezid.</p>
<p class="bas indent2"><span class="nm">2.</span><span class="cl">Rejection:</span> It says 'since Yom Kipur atones for Mezid, perhaps it atones also for Einam Shavim.'(Clearly, they are different!)</p>
<p class="bas indent1"><span class="nm">(l)</span><span class="cl">Answer #1:</span> Einam Shavim is like Ula taught. (He was Memir Daito (became an idolater) after sinning. Shavim is one who was not Memir Daito):</p>
<p class="bas indent2"><span class="nm">1.</span><span class="cl">(Ula):</span> If Reuven ate Chelev (b'Shogeg), separated a Korban for it, was Memir Daito, and repented, the Dichuy (disqualification, an idolater may not bring a Korban) is permanent. (Likewise, if one sinned and was Memir Daito before Yom Kipur, and repented, (even a future) Yom Kipur does not atone for him.)</p>
<p class="bas indent1"><span class="nm">(m)</span><span class="cl">Rejection:</span> We cannot learn this from Ula. In Ula's case, the Korban was Nidcheh, but after repenting from idolatry, one can get Kaparah!</p>
<p class="bas indent1"><span class="nm">(n)</span><span class="cl">Answer #2:</span> Shavim are those who want the Korban to atone. Einam Shavim are those who do not want the Korban to atone.</p>
<p class="bas indent1"><span class="nm">(o)</span>(The Beraisa says that Chatas does not atone for Einam Shavim.) This is a proof for Abaye. Surely Rava retracted.</p>
<p class="bas indent1"><span class="nm">(p)</span><span class="cl">Contradiction (Beraisa #2) Suggestion:</span> Perhaps Yom Kipur atones only for one who fasts, refrains from Melachah, and calls it Mikra Kodesh (Rashi - declares Kedushas ha'Yom in prayer; Tosfos - honors it with clean clothing; R. Tam (Shevu'os 13a) - he refrains from Melachah <i>due to</i> Kedushas ha'Yom), but if he did not, it does not atone for him!</p>
<p class="bas indent2"><span class="nm">1.</span><span class="cl">Rejection:</span> "Yom ha'Kipurim Hu" teaches that in any case, it atones (i.e. even for Einam Shavim).</p>
<p class="bas indent2"><span class="nm">2.</span>Both Beraisos are from Sifra (they expound verses in Vayikra). A Stam Sifra is assumed to be R. Yehudah!</p>
<p class="bas indent1"><span class="nm">(q)</span><span class="cl">Answer #1 (Abaye):</span> Beraisa #1 is like (Rebbi according to - Rashi deletes this from the text) R. Yehudah. Beraisa #2 is Rebbi (himself);</p>
<p class="bas indent2"><span class="nm">1.</span><span class="cl">(Beraisa - Rebbi):</span> Yom Kipur atones for all sins, whether or not he repented, except for three - one who casts off the yoke (of all Mitzvos), Mefer Bris (Rashi (to Avos 3:11) - does not circumcise himself, R. Yonah - pulls his foreskin to appear uncircumcised) and Megaleh Panim b'Torah (Rashi, based on Sifri - mocks Torah; R. Yonah - publicly transgresses (Yerushalmi), or acts arrogantly towards Chachamim).</p>
<p class="bas indent2"><span class="nm">2.</span>For these, Yom Kipur atones only if he repented.</p>
<p class="bas indent1"><span class="nm">(r)</span><span class="cl">Answer #2 (Rava):</span> Both Beraisos are like Rebbi;</p>
<p class="bas indent2"><span class="nm">1.</span>(Beraisa #1 discusses eating or doing Melachah on Yom Kipur.) Rebbi agrees that Yom Kipur does not atone for transgressions of Yom Kipur (without Teshuvah).</p>
<p class="bas indent2"><span class="nm">2.</span><span class="cl">Support:</span> We must say so. Since every moment of Yom Kipur atones, if Kaparah did not require Teshuvah, Kares for transgressions of Yom Kipur would never apply!</p>
<p class="bas indent2"><span class="nm">3.</span><span class="cl">Objection:</span> (Even if Teshuvah is not required,) Kares applies to one who transgressed at night, and died before morning! (The Kaparah is only during the daytime.)</p>
<p class="bas indent2"><span class="nm">4.</span><span class="cl">Answer:</span> (One who eats or does Melachah during the daytime of Yom Kipur is Chayav Kares.) To be liable for transgressing Yom Kipur during the day, we must say that Kaparah for transgressions of Yom Kipur requires Teshuvah.</p>
<p class="bas indent2"><span class="nm">5.</span><span class="cl">Objection:</span> In any case, Kares applies to one who choked while eating, or struck himself and died while chopping, or did Melachah until dark. There was no time for Kaparah! (Kaparah is only <i>after</i> the Aveirah is finished.)</p>
<p class="bas indent2"><span class="nm">6.</span>(Shitah's text - Rather, we must answer like Abaye.)</p>
<p class="bas subject"><span class="nm">3)</span>WHAT IS <i>MEGADEF</i>?</p>
<p class="bas indent1"><span class="nm">(a)</span><span class="cl">(Mishnah - Chachamim):</span> Also Megadef is exempt (from a Korban).</p>
<p class="bas indent1"><span class="nm">(b)</span><span class="cl">Question:</span> Why does it say "<i>also</i> Megadef"?</p>
<p class="bas indent1"><span class="nm">(c)</span><span class="cl">Answer:</span> Chachamim heard that R. Akiva taught Ba'al Ov, but not Yid'oni;</p>
<p class="bas indent2"><span class="nm">1.</span><span class="cl">Chachamim:</span> Presumably, you exempt Yid'oni because Ein Bo Ma'aseh. The same applies to Megadef!</p>
<p class="bas indent1"><span class="nm">(d)</span><span class="cl">(Beraisa - R. Akiva):</span> Kares is written regarding Megadef, therefore he brings a Korban.</p>
<p class="bas indent2"><span class="nm">1.</span>It also says "v'Nasa Chet'o."</p>
<p class="bas indent1"><span class="nm">(e)</span><span class="cl">Question:</span> There are Aveiros for which Kares is written, but one does not bring a Korban!</p>
<p class="bas indent2"><span class="nm">1.</span>One does not bring a Korban for (failing to fulfill) Korban Pesach or Milah, even though Kares is written regarding them!</p>
<p class="bas bbbline">7b----------------------------------------7b</p>
<p class="bas indent1"><span class="nm">(f)</span><span class="cl">Answer:</span> R. Akiva means that since Kares of Megadef is written in the Parshah of Korban, one brings a Korban for it;</p>
<p class="bas indent2"><span class="nm">1.</span>He holds that it should have been written elsewhere. It was written regarding Korban to teach that one brings a Korban for it.</p>
<p class="bas indent2"><span class="nm">2.</span>'It says also "Chet'o Yisa"' was said by (Rashi; Tosfos - to answer) Chachamim;</p>
<p class="bas indent1"><span class="nm">(g)</span><span class="cl">Version #1 (our text, Tosfos):</span> R. Akiva had said, according to you, who exempt Megadef from Korban because Ein Bo Ma'aseh, Megadef is blasphemy. Why is Kares written regarding it?</p>
