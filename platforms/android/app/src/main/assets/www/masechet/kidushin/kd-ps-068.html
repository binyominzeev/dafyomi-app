<p class="bas subject"><span class="nm">1)</span>ALL ARAYOS HAVE THE SAME LAW</p>
<p class="bas indent1"><span class="nm">(a)</span><span class="cl">Answer #3 (R. Yonah):</span> "Any of these abominations" equates all Arayos (including Achos Ishto);</p>
<p class="bas indent2"><span class="nm">1.</span>Kidushin cannot take effect on Achos Ishto, and similarly for all Arayos.</p>
<p class="bas indent1"><span class="nm">(b)</span><span class="cl">Question:</span> If so, Kidushin should not take effect on a Nidah (also Nidah is in the Parshah)!</p>
<p class="bas indent2"><span class="nm">1.</span><span class="cl">(Abaye):</span> All agree that a child resulting from Bi'ah with a Nidah or a Sotah is not a Mamzer.</p>
<p class="bas indent1"><span class="nm">(c)</span><span class="cl">(Chizkiyah):</span> "Va'Tehi Nidasah Alav" - even when she is a Nidah, there is Havayah (Kidushin).</p>
<p class="bas indent1"><span class="nm">(d)</span><span class="cl">Question:</span> (The Torah specified that Kidushin is Tofes on a Nidah, but not on Achos Ishto.) Why do we equate other relatives to Achos Ishto, and not to a Nidah?</p>
<p class="bas indent1"><span class="nm">(e)</span><span class="cl">Answer #1:</span> If there are two possibilities, we equate things in the more stringent way.</p>
<p class="bas indent1"><span class="nm">(f)</span><span class="cl">Answer #2 (Rav Acha bar Yakov):</span> We learn from a Yevamah that we are stringent.</p>
<p class="bas indent2"><span class="nm">1.</span>Bi'ah of a Yevamah with a stranger is only Chayavei Lavin, yet she cannot be Mekudeshes to a stranger. All the more so, there is no Kidushin for Arayos punishable by death and Kares!</p>
<p class="bas subject"><span class="nm">2)</span>KIDUSHIN FOR CHAYAVEI LAVIN</p>
<p class="bas indent1"><span class="nm">(a)</span><span class="cl">Question:</span> According to Rav Acha bar Yakov, we should learn that Kidushin cannot take effect even for Chayevei Lavin!</p>
<p class="bas indent1"><span class="nm">(b)</span><span class="cl">Answer (Rav Papa):</span> A verse teaches that Kidushin is Tofes for Chayevei Lavin:</p>
<p class="bas indent2"><span class="nm">1.</span><span class="cl">Question:</span> "When Tihyenah (will be) to a man two wives, one beloved and one hated..." - why should his love or hatred for his wives affect inheritance?!</p>
<p class="bas indent2"><span class="nm">2.</span><span class="cl">Answer:</span> Rather, the marriages are beloved and hated (i.e. permitted and forbidden), and the Torah says Tihyenah (alluding to Havayah, i.e. Kidushin)!</p>
<p class="bas indent1"><span class="nm">(c)</span><span class="cl">Question:</span> R. Akiva holds that Kidushin is not Tofes for Chayevei Lavin. How does he explain the verse?</p>
<p class="bas indent1"><span class="nm">(d)</span><span class="cl">Answer #1:</span> The way R. Simai explains R. Akiva, the verse can discuss a Kohen Gadol. One of his wives is a widow;</p>
<p class="bas indent2"><span class="nm">1.</span><span class="cl">(Beraisa - R. Simai):</span> R. Akiva says that children from any forbidden Bi'ah are Mamzerim (and if so, there cannot be Kidushin between the parents), except for a widow who marries a Kohen Gadol, for there the Torah said "He will not take... he will not profane";</p>
<p class="bas indent2"><span class="nm">2.</span>He makes his children profaned (Chalalim), not Mamzerim.</p>
<p class="bas indent1"><span class="nm">(e)</span><span class="cl">Answer #2A:</span> R. Yesheivav says that R. Akiva holds that any forbidden relationship with a Yisre'elis produces Mamzerim;</p>
<p class="bas indent2"><span class="nm">1.</span>If R. Yesheivav came to argue with R. Simai, he refers only to Chayavei Lavin of Kohanim, but he admits that Bi'ah forbidden by an Aseh (e.g. a Mitzri Rishon or Sheni to a Yisre'elis) does not make Mamzerim. If so, the verse can discuss such a marriage.</p>
<p class="bas indent1"><span class="nm">(f)</span><span class="cl">Question:</span> If R. Yesheivav's teaching was independent (and applies in all cases), how does R. Akiva explain the verse?</p>
<p class="bas indent1"><span class="nm">(g)</span><span class="cl">Answer #2B:</span> It discusses a Kohen Gadol who married a girl who was not a virgin.</p>
<p class="bas indent1"><span class="nm">(h)</span><span class="cl">Question:</span> Why is this different than other Chayavei Aseh (which produce Mamzerim)?</p>
<p class="bas indent1"><span class="nm">(i)</span><span class="cl">Answer:</span> The Isur does not apply to everyone (a Kohen Gadol is the only man commanded about this).</p>
<p class="bas indent1"><span class="nm">(j)</span><span class="cl">Question:</span> Why do Chachamim say that the verse discusses Chayavei Lavin (and teaches that Kidushin is Tofes)? They should learn a smaller Chidush, and say that it discusses a Chayavei Aseh!</p>
<p class="bas indent1"><span class="nm">(k)</span><span class="cl">Answer:</span> There is no Chayavei Aseh it could discuss!</p>
<p class="bas indent2"><span class="nm">1.</span>If his wives are Mitzriyos, both marriages are hated!</p>
<p class="bas indent2"><span class="nm">2.</span><span class="cl">Suggestion:</span> One wife is a Mitzris, and the other is a Bas Yisrael.</p>
<p class="bas indent2"><span class="nm">3.</span><span class="cl">Rejection:</span> The verse connotes that both wives are from the same nation!</p>
<p class="bas indent2"><span class="nm">4.</span>The verse discusses a Kohen Gadol who married a non-virgin.</p>
<p class="bas indent2"><span class="nm">5.</span><span class="cl">Rejection:</span> The verse discusses a man who has two wives, not specifically the Kohen Gadol!</p>
<p class="bas indent2"><span class="nm">6.</span>Even though (R. Simai says that) R. Akiva learns this way, he does so only because he has no alternative.</p>
<p class="bas subject"><span class="nm">3)</span>CHILDREN OF A SLAVE OR NOCHRIS</p>
<p class="bas indent1"><span class="nm">(a)</span><span class="cl">(Mishnah):</span> Any woman who cannot be Mekudeshes to any man...</p>
<p class="bas indent1"><span class="nm">(b)</span><span class="cl">Question:</span> What is the source that a Shifchah cannot be Mekudeshes?</p>
<p class="bas indent1"><span class="nm">(c)</span><span class="cl">Answer (Rav Huna):</span> We read "stay Im (with) the donkey" (this was said to Eliezer, an Eved Kena'ani) like Am (a nation), equating slaves to a donkey (Kidushin does not apply to them).</p>
<p class="bas bbbline">68b----------------------------------------68b</p>
<p class="bas indent1"><span class="nm">(d)</span><span class="cl">Question:</span> What is the source that children of a Shifchah are slaves?</p>
<p class="bas indent1"><span class="nm">(e)</span><span class="cl">Answer:</span> "The woman (Shifchah) and her children (from an Eved Ivri) will be to her master".</p>
<p class="bas indent1"><span class="nm">(f)</span><span class="cl">Question:</span> What is the source regarding a Nochris?</p>
<p class="bas indent1"><span class="nm">(g)</span><span class="cl">Answer:</span> "Al Tischaten Bam" (there is no marriage with them. Ri - the verse continues "Do not give your daughter (for marriage) to a Nochri's son, and do not take a Nochri's daughter for your son." The additional Lavim teach that even b'Di'eved there is no Kidushin.)</p>
<p class="bas indent1"><span class="nm">(h)</span><span class="cl">Question:</span> This teaches about Kidushin. What is the source that children of a Nochris are Nochrim?</p>
<p class="bas indent1"><span class="nm">(i)</span><span class="cl">Answer (R. Yochanan):</span> "For he will veer your son away from Me" - your son from a Yisre'elis is called your son, but your son from a Nochris is not called your son, rather, her son. (Rashi - this verse refers to the Seifa of the previous verse. He (your Nochri son-in-law) will veer your son, i.e. grandson. The grandson is from a Yisre'elis (your daughter), so he is called your son (he is a Yisrael). It does not say (about the Reisha) that she (your Nochris daughter-in-law) will veer your son, for your grandson from a Nochris is not called your son (he is a Nochri). Tosfos - "He will veer your son" refers to the Reisha of the previous verse. He, your son's Nochri father-in-law, will veer your son from Me. The Torah is not concerned lest he veer your grandson, for he is not called your son. (He is a Nochri, like his mother.) R. Yochanan did not discuss children of a Yisre'elis from a Nochri. This was Ravina's Chidush.)</p>
<p class="bas indent1"><span class="nm">(j)</span><span class="cl">(Ravina):</span> We learn that your daughter's son fathered by a Nochri is called your son. (Tosfos - had the Torah expressed concern (only) about your daughter, this would have shown that the grandson is a Nochri. The Torah did not, for it is concerned also about the grandson. Since his mother is a Yisre'elis, he is a Yisrael.)</p>
<p class="bas indent1"><span class="nm">(k)</span><span class="cl">Question:</span> "Al Tischasen Bam" discusses the seven Kena'ani nations. What is the source for a woman of another nation (that she cannot be Mekudeshes, and her children are like her)?</p>
<p class="bas indent1"><span class="nm">(l)</span><span class="cl">Answer:</span> "He will veer your son" includes anyone who would veer (i.e. all Nochrim).</p>
<p class="bas indent1"><span class="nm">(m)</span><span class="cl">Question:</span> This is like R. Shimon, who derives laws based on (his understanding of) the reason for Mitzvos. What is Chachamim's source regarding other nations?</p>
<p class="bas indent1"><span class="nm">(n)</span><span class="cl">Answer:</span> (In war, one who desires a Nochris can force her to convert after one or three months.) "Afterwards you may have Bi'ah with her (and take her for a wife)" implies that you could not be Mekadesh her before (conversion).</p>
<p class="bas indent1"><span class="nm">(o)</span><span class="cl">Question:</span> What is Chachamim's source that children of a Nochris are Nochrim?</p>
<p class="bas indent1"><span class="nm">(p)</span><span class="cl">Answer:</span> "When Tihyenah to a man two wives, and they will bear children to him" - children are attributed to the father only when the mother could have Havayah (Kidushin).</p>
<p class="bas indent1"><span class="nm">(q)</span><span class="cl">Question:</span> If so, this is also a source that children of a slave are slaves!</p>
<p class="bas indent1"><span class="nm">(r)</span><span class="cl">Answer:</span> That is true!</p>
<p class="bas indent1"><span class="nm">(s)</span><span class="cl">Question:</span> What do we learn from "the woman (slave) and her children will be to her master"?</p>
<p class="bas indent1"><span class="nm">(t)</span><span class="cl">Answer (Beraisa - Rebbi Yosi ha'Glili):</span> If one wrote in a Get of freedom to his (pregnant) slave 'you are free, and your fetus is a slave' (and gave the Get), the child is (free) like her;</p>
<p class="bas indent1"><span class="nm">(u)</span>Chachamim say, his words are fulfilled - "The (slave) and her children will be to her master".</p>
<p class="bas indent1"><span class="nm">(v)</span><span class="cl">Question:</span> How do they learn this law from the verse?</p>
<p class="bas indent1"><span class="nm">(w)</span><span class="cl">Answer:</span> The verse is the source for Rebbi Yosi ha'Glili's law (the child is to the master only when his mother is to the master).</p>
