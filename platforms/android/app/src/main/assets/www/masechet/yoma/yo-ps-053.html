<p class="dedicationbox">YOMA 53 - Two weeks of study material have been dedicated by Mrs. Estanne Abraham Fawer to honor the Yahrzeit of her father, Rav Mordechai ben Eliezer Zvi (Rabbi Morton Weiner) Z'L, who passed away on 18 Teves 5760. May the merit of supporting and advancing Dafyomi study -- which was so important to him -- during the weeks of his Yahrzeit serve as an Iluy for his Neshamah. </p>

<div class="subject"><span class="nm">1)</span><p>THE DISPUTE WITH THE TZEDOKIM</p></div>
<div class="indent1"><span class="nm">(a)</span><p>The Beraisa teaches that the Kohen Gadol puts the Ketores on the coals only inside the Kodesh ha'Kodoshim, not like the Tzedokim who would have him do it prior to his entry.</p></div>
<div class="indent1"><span class="nm">(b)</span><p><span class="cl">Question:</span> What is the basis for the Tzedoki error?</p></div>
<div class="indent1"><span class="nm">(c)</span><p><span class="cl">Answer:</span> The Pasuk "Ki be'Anan... "</p></div>
<div class="indent1"><span class="nm">(d)</span><p>The Chachamim responded that the Pasuk already taught "Lifnei Hash-m" (and the Pasuk "Ki be'Anan" teaches that he should add Ma'aleh Ashan to the Ketores).</p></div>
<div class="subject"><span class="nm">2)</span><p>MA'ALEH ASHAN</p></div>
<div class="indent1"><span class="nm">(a)</span><p><span class="cl">Question:</span> How do we know that Ma'aleh Ashan must be added?</p></div>
<div class="indent1"><span class="nm">(b)</span><p><span class="cl">Answer:</span> "ve'Chishah Anan ha'Ketores" (whence we learn that one who omits Ma'aleh Ashan or another of the ingredients is Chayav Misah).</p></div>
<div class="indent1"><span class="nm">(c)</span><p><span class="cl">Question:</span> The Chiyuv Misah should be obvious since he would then be entering the Kodesh ha'Kodoshim without cause!?</p></div>
<div class="indent1"><span class="nm">(d)</span><p><span class="cl">Answer:</span> He was a Shogeg regarding entering for naught, but he intentionally omitted an ingredient.</p></div>
<div class="indent1"><span class="nm">(e)</span><p><span class="cl">Alternate Answer (R. Ashi):</span> He was Meizid by both, but the Pasuk speaks where he went in with two Ketoros, one proper and one defective.</p></div>
<div class="indent1"><span class="nm">(f)</span><p><span class="cl">Question:</span> Why do we need "ve'Chisah" (to know that he includes Ma'aleh Ashan) over and above "Ki be'Anan"?</p></div>
<div class="indent1"><span class="nm">(g)</span><p><span class="cl">Answer:</span> To teach that we may even include the root, not only the leaf, of the Ma'aleh Ashan.</p></div>
<div class="indent1"><span class="nm">(h)</span><p><span class="cl">Question:</span> But the Beraisa teaches that the root is <i>superior</i> (causes the smoke to rise straight up).</p></div>
<div class="indent1"><span class="nm">(i)</span><p><span class="cl">Answer:</span> The second Pasuk ("ve'Chisah") permits even the leaf.</p></div>
<div class="indent1"><span class="nm">(j)</span><p><span class="cl">Alternate Answer (R. Sheishes):</span> "ve'Chisah" teaches the rule of Ma'aleh Ashan even beyond the Mishkan in the desert.</p></div>
<div class="indent1"><span class="nm">(k)</span><p><span class="cl">Question:</span> But this extension is learned from "ve'Chein Ya'aseh!"</p></div>
<div class="indent1"><span class="nm">(l)</span><p><span class="cl">Answer:</span> Rather, "ve'Chisah" teaches that the requirement of Ma'aleh Ashan is year-round (not only Yom Kipur).</p></div>
<div class="indent1"><span class="nm">(m)</span><p><span class="cl">Alternate Answer (R. Ashi):</span> One Pasuk is for the Mitzvah; one is to teach that Ma'aleh Ashan is Me'akev.</p></div>
<div class="indent1"><span class="nm">(n)</span><p><span class="cl">Alternate Answer (Rava):</span> One Pasuk is for Onesh; one is for Azharah (as cited in the name of R. Elazar in the Beraisa).</p></div>
<div class="indent2"><span class="nm">1.</span><p>The Beraisa goes on to negate the possibility that the prohibition is only prior to the incident of the sons of Aharon.</p></div>
<div class="indent2"><span class="nm">2.</span><p>Similarly, the Pasuk is used to preclude the suggestion that it is only <i>after</i> the incident.</p></div>
<div class="indent2"><span class="nm">3.</span><p><span class="cl">Question:</span> How are these compatible?</p></div>
<div class="indent2"><span class="nm">4.</span><p><span class="cl">Answer:</span> The Azharah preceded the incident and the Onesh followed.</p></div>
<div class="indent2"><span class="nm">5.</span><p><span class="cl">Question:</span> How does the Pasuk imply that the Azharah preceded the incident?</p></div>
<div class="indent2"><span class="nm">6.</span><p><span class="cl">Answer:</span> The future "Eira'eh".</p></div>
<div class="subject"><span class="nm">3)</span><p>THE SONS OF AHARON</p></div>
<div class="indent1"><span class="nm">(a)</span><p><span class="cl">Question:</span> (Given that the Onesh was not yet given,) why were Aharon's sons punished?</p></div>
<div class="indent1"><span class="nm">(b)</span><p><span class="cl">Answer:</span> They issued a ruling in the presence of their teacher, Moshe.</p></div>
<div class="indent1"><span class="nm">(c)</span><p><span class="cl">Question:</span> On what basis did they determine to bring the fire from Hedyot?</p></div>
<div class="indent1"><span class="nm">(d)</span><p><span class="cl">Answer:</span> The Pasuk says "ve'Nasnu B'nei Aharon Eish!"</p></div>
<div class="subject"><span class="nm">4)</span><p>HE LEFT AS HE CAME</p></div>
<div class="indent1"><span class="nm">(a)</span><p><span class="cl">Question:</span> What is the source for not turning around to leave?</p></div>
<div class="indent1"><span class="nm">(b)</span><p><span class="cl">Answer:</span> The Pasuk "mi'Givon Yerushalayim" teaches that he left Givon the way he came (facing the Bamah).</p></div>
<div class="indent1"><span class="nm">(c)</span><p>The same holds for the Levi'im and Yisre'elim in the Mikdash as well as a student taking leave of his Rebbe (e.g. R. Elazar leaving R. Yochanan).</p></div>
<div class="indent2"><span class="nm">1.</span><p>When R. Yochanan wished to leave, R. Elazar stood...</p></div>
<div class="indent2"><span class="nm">2.</span><p>When R. Elazar wished to leave he would reverse his steps...</p></div>
<div class="indent2"><span class="nm">3.</span><p>Rava would take leave of R. Yosef in like manner.</p></div>
<div class="bbbline">53b----------------------------------------53b</p></div>
<div class="indent2"><span class="nm">4.</span><p>When R. Yosef was informed of this he blessed Rava.</p></div>
<div class="subject"><span class="nm">5)</span><p>STEPPING BACK FROM PRAYER</p></div>
<div class="indent1"><span class="nm">(a)</span><p>One who has prayed must take three steps back and extend Shalom.</p></div>
<div class="indent1"><span class="nm">(b)</span><p>He must pause there, like a student taking leave of his Rebbe (as supported by the Beraisa) as turning away immediately would be an insult.</p></div>
<div class="indent1"><span class="nm">(c)</span><p>He extends Shalom to the right, then left, as supported by two Pesukim.</p></div>
<div class="indent1"><span class="nm">(d)</span><p><span class="cl">Question:</span> Why do we need the second Pasuk?</p></div>
<div class="indent1"><span class="nm">(e)</span><p><span class="cl">Answer:</span> The Luchos might be carried in the right as that is the common manner, while the second Pasuk underscores the importance of the right.</p></div>
<div class="indent1"><span class="nm">(f)</span><p>Rava corrected Abaye by pointing out that right means the right of Hash-m (our left).</p></div>
<div class="indent1"><span class="nm">(g)</span><p>It was reported that Abaye and Rava bowed as they stepped back.</p></div>
<div class="subject"><span class="nm">6)</span><p>THE BRIEF PRAYER</p></div>
<div class="indent1"><span class="nm">(a)</span><p><span class="cl">Question:</span> What was his Tefilah?</p></div>
<div class="indent1"><span class="nm">(b)</span><p><span class="cl">Answer:</span> 'Yehi Ratzon... Geshumah u'Shechunah'.</p></div>
<div class="indent1"><span class="nm">(c)</span><p><span class="cl">Question:</span> Is a hot year a good thing?</p></div>
<div class="indent1"><span class="nm">(d)</span><p><span class="cl">Answer:</span> It should be balanced.</p></div>
<div class="indent1"><span class="nm">(e)</span><p>R. Acha b. Rava citing R. Yehudah added to the Tefilah of the Kohen Gadol:</p></div>
<div class="indent2"><span class="nm">1.</span><p>'Let not the rulership pass from the upright house of Yehudah.</p></div>
<div class="indent2"><span class="nm">2.</span><p>Let not one Jew need to be sustained by another.</p></div>
<div class="indent2"><span class="nm">3.</span><p>Let not the prayers of wayfarers be accepted'.</p></div>
<div class="indent1"><span class="nm">(f)</span><p>R. Chanina b. Dosa was able to petition for rain to stop and restart.</p></div>
<div class="indent1"><span class="nm">(g)</span><p>The Tefilah of the Kohen Gadol was no contest for the Tefilah of R. Chanina.</p></div>
<div class="indent1"><span class="nm">(h)</span><p>In one incident the Kohen Gadol lengthened his Tefilah, leading to the concern mentioned in the Mishnah.</p></div>
<div class="subject"><span class="nm">7)</span><p>MISHNAH: THE ZERIKOS</p></div>
<div class="indent1"><span class="nm">(a)</span><p>The Even ha'Shesiyah stood where the Aron once stood.</p></div>
<div class="indent1"><span class="nm">(b)</span><p>He went in (with the Dam which was being stirred) and did the Zerikas Dam ha'Par in the Kodesh ha'Kodoshim.</p></div>
<div class="indent1"><span class="nm">(c)</span><p>The Haza'ah was one upward and seven downward (not on the Paroches but on the ground below) while counting aloud.</p></div>
<div class="indent1"><span class="nm">(d)</span><p>He brought that Dam out and went back in with the Dam Sa'ir and repeated the Zerikah.</p></div>
<div class="indent1"><span class="nm">(e)</span><p>There is a Machlokes whether there was one or two shelves.</p></div>
<div class="indent1"><span class="nm">(f)</span><p>He did a set of Zerikos in the Heichal with each Dam as well.</p></div>
<div class="indent1"><span class="nm">(g)</span><p>He then poured the remaining Dam of the Par into the Dam of the Sa'ir, and then poured its contents back.</p></div>
