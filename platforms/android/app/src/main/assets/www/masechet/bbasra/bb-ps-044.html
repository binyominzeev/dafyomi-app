<p class="bas subject"><span class="nm">1)</span>TESTIMONY THAT MAY HELP THE WITNESS (cont.)</p>
<p class="bas indent1"><span class="nm">(a)</span><span class="cl">Question:</span> We could establish the Beraisa more simply! Reuven stole Shimon's field (and did not sell it), and Yehudah claims that it was his. Shimon cannot testify for Reuven, like we explained above.</p>
<p class="bas indent1"><span class="nm">(b)</span><span class="cl">Answer:</span> We establish the Reisha of the Beraisa regarding a sale for parallel structure with the Seifa, regarding a cow or garment;</p>
<p class="bas indent2"><span class="nm">1.</span>The case of a cow or garment must discuss a sale, for the buyer keeps it only if the original owner despaired <i>and</i> there was change of Reshus;</p>
<p class="bas indent2"><span class="nm">2.</span>If it were not sold, it would revert to the owner, so Shimon could not testify about it.</p>
<p class="bas indent1"><span class="nm">(c)</span><span class="cl">Question:</span> Regarding a cow or garment, even if he despairs from getting back the stolen object, he does not despair of getting back his money! (Since he can gain from his testimony, why can he testify?)</p>
<p class="bas indent1"><span class="nm">(d)</span><span class="cl">Answer:</span> The case is, the thief (Reuven) died;</p>
<p class="bas indent2"><span class="nm">1.</span><span class="cl">(Mishnah):</span> If David stole from Moshe and fed the stolen object to his sons, or left it to them and he died, they need not return it to Moshe or pay Moshe (if Moshe despaired before David died (so the sons acquire through despair and change of Reshus), or if they already ate it).</p>
<p class="bas indent1"><span class="nm">(e)</span><span class="cl">Question:</span> If Reuven died, even if he did not sell it, Shimon can testify for Reuven's heir!</p>
<p class="bas indent1"><span class="nm">(f)</span><span class="cl">Answer #1:</span> According to the opinion that an heir's Reshus is unlike a buyer's Reshus, the heir would have to return it. This explains why Shimon could not testify.</p>
<p class="bas indent1"><span class="nm">(g)</span><span class="cl">Question #1:</span> According to the opinion that an heir's Reshus is like a buyer's Reshus, also the heir need not return it, so the question remains;</p>
<p class="bas indent1"><span class="nm">(h)</span><span class="cl">Question #2 (against Rav Sheshes - Abaye):</span> The Beraisa explains that the difference between the cases is whether there is Achrayus (i.e. the seller must compensate the buyer if the land is taken). According to Rav Sheshes, the difference is whether or not Shimon gets back his property!</p>
<p class="bas indent1"><span class="nm">(i)</span><span class="cl">Answer #2 (to Question 3:c, 43b - Ravin bar Shmuel):</span> The Beraisa says, if Reuven sold a house or field (even without Achrayus), he cannot testify about it, for this will enable his creditor to collect it;</p>
<p class="bas indent2"><span class="nm">1.</span>If he sold a cow or garment, he can testify about it, for a creditor cannot collect it (from the buyer);</p>
<p class="bas bbbline">44b----------------------------------------44b</p>
<p class="bas indent2"><span class="nm">2.</span>This is even if the loan document empowers the creditor to collect 'from the shirt off his back.' These words apply only when the borrower still owns it;</p>
<p class="bas indent2"><span class="nm">3.</span>This is even if Reuven made the cow or garment an Apotiki from which the loan will be collected, due to Rava's law;</p>
<p class="bas indent3"><span class="nm">i.</span><span class="cl">(Rava):</span> If one made his slave an Apotiki and sold him, the creditor collects him. If an animal was made an Apotiki and it was sold, the creditor does not collect it.</p>
<p class="bas indent3"><span class="nm">ii.</span><span class="cl">Question:</span> What is the reason?</p>
<p class="bas indent3"><span class="nm">iii.</span><span class="cl">Answer:</span> A sale of a slave has publicity, but a sale of an animal does not (so the buyer did not know to beware).</p>
<p class="bas indent1"><span class="nm">(j)</span><span class="cl">Question:</span> We should be concerned lest Reuven gave his creditor a lien on the cow or garment Agav (along with) land (for then the creditor can collect from them, so Reuven gains from his testimony)!</p>
<p class="bas indent2"><span class="nm">1.</span><span class="cl">(Rabah):</span> Metaltelim (movable objects) are acquired Agav land (not only absolutely, but also regarding a lien).</p>
<p class="bas indent2"><span class="nm">2.</span><span class="cl">(Rav Chisda):</span> This is only if the document says 'this is not Asmachta (an exaggerated, insincere promise) nor a mere form document (from which one copies the text).'</p>
<p class="bas indent1"><span class="nm">(k)</span><span class="cl">Answer:</span> The case is, he sold a cow or garment right after buying it (surely, he did not borrow in between).</p>
<p class="bas indent1"><span class="nm">(l)</span><span class="cl">Question:</span> Perhaps he (borrowed before he bought it, and) gave the creditor rights to collect from 'd'Ikni (what I will acquire)'!</p>
<p class="bas indent2"><span class="nm">1.</span><span class="cl">Suggestion:</span> This teaches that a stipulation 'd'Ikni' does not enable the creditor to collect the property from one who bought or inherited it from the borrower! (Rather, he collects only as long as the borrower owns it)!</p>
<p class="bas indent1"><span class="nm">(m)</span><span class="cl">Answer:</span> No, the case is that witnesses say that Reuven never owned land (so we need not worry that he gave a lien Agav land).</p>
<p class="bas indent1"><span class="nm">(n)</span><span class="cl">Question:</span> Rav Papa taught that even though one who sells land without Achrayus, the buyer has no claim against the seller if it is taken by a creditor, he has a claim if the seller did not own it! (Therefore, Reuven profits from his testimony!)</p>
<p class="bas indent1"><span class="nm">(o)</span><span class="cl">Answer:</span> The case is, the buyer admits that Reuven owned the cow or garment.</p>
<p class="bas indent1"><span class="nm">(p)</span><span class="cl">(Rav Zvid):</span> If one sells land without Achrayus, the buyer has no claim against the seller even if the seller did not own it (and the true owner takes it from the buyer);</p>
<p class="bas indent2"><span class="nm">1.</span>The seller can say 'this is why I sold it without Achrayus!</p>
