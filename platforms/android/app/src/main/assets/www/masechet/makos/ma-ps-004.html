<p class="bas indent1"><span class="nm">(a)</span><span class="cl">Answer (Rava):</span> Rav holds like R. Yochanan ben Nuri, and R. Chiya's Beraisa holds like Chachamim.</p>
<p class="bas indent2"><span class="nm">1.</span><span class="cl">(Mishnah):</span> If a Kortov of wine fell into water, and the volume of the mixture is three Lugim, and it looks like wine, the mixture does not disqualify a Mikveh. (This is because there are not three full Lugim of water in the mixture, but if there were, it would disqualify the Mikveh);</p>
<p class="bas indent2"><span class="nm">2.</span>Similarly, if a Kortov of milk fell into water, and there are three Lugim in the mixture, and it looks like water, the mixture does not disqualify a Mikveh;</p>
<p class="bas indent2"><span class="nm">3.</span>R. Yochanan ben Nuri says, it all depends on the appearance (if it looks like water, it disqualifies a Mikveh).</p>
<p class="bas indent1"><span class="nm">(b)</span><span class="cl">Question:</span> Rav Papa was unsure about this!</p>
<p class="bas indent2"><span class="nm">1.</span><span class="cl">Question (Rav Papa):</span> Did Rav's text of the first clause of the Mishnah say that the volume of the <i>mixture</i> is three Lugim, but if there were three Lugim of water alone, Chachamim disqualify the Mikveh?</p>
<p class="bas indent3"><span class="nm">i.</span>If so, Rav holds like R. Yochanan ben Nuri.</p>
<p class="bas indent2"><span class="nm">2.</span>Or, did Rav's text say that the volume of the water is three Lugim, and R. Yochanan ben Nuri argues only in the second clause?</p>
<p class="bas indent3"><span class="nm">i.</span>If so, Rav's law is like everyone.</p>
<p class="bas indent1"><span class="nm">(c)</span><span class="cl">Answer:</span> Rav Papa was unsure. Rava was sure (that Rav holds like R. Yochanan ben Nuri).</p>
<p class="bas indent1"><span class="nm">(d)</span><span class="cl">Rav Yosef:</span> I (was a Talmid of Rav, yet I) never heard this teaching!</p>
<p class="bas indent1"><span class="nm">(e)</span><span class="cl">Abaye:</span> You yourself taught us that Rav's text says that there are three Lugim of water, and Rav's law is like everyone! (Rav Yosef forgot his learning when he fell sick.)</p>
<p class="bas subject"><span class="nm">2)</span>CONCERN LEST A LIQUID DID NOT DISPERSE</p>
<p class="bas indent1"><span class="nm">(a)</span><span class="cl">Version #1 - Rashi - (Rav Yehudah):</span> If a barrel of water fell into the Mediterranean, one who immerses there (Ya'avetz - in the barrel) may not eat or touch Terumah. We are concerned lest three Lugim remain there (of the original water. If three Lugim of Mayim She'uvim fall on someone, or a Tevul Yom (one who immersed today from Tum'ah) enters Mayim She'uvim in a Keli, he is Tamei mid'Rabanan.)</p>
<p class="bas indent1"><span class="nm">(b)</span><span class="cl">Version #2 - Tosfos - (Rav Yehudah):</span> If a barrel of wine fell into the Mediterranean, immersion there does not help. We are concerned lest the wine did not disperse (and he immersed in wine, and not water). (end of Version #2)</p>
<p class="bas indent2"><span class="nm">1.</span>This applies only to the Mediterranean, which is stagnant, but rivers flow.</p>
<p class="bas indent1"><span class="nm">(c)</span><span class="cl">Support (Beraisa):</span> If a barrel of wine fell into the Mediterranean, immersion there does not help. We are concerned lest (three Lugim of She'uvim; many texts - it) did not disperse;</p>
<p class="bas indent2"><span class="nm">1.</span>Similarly, if a Terumah loaf fell in (after a man immersed), it is Tamei (lest it touched wine that the man was Metamei).</p>
<p class="bas indent1"><span class="nm">(d)</span><span class="cl">Question:</span> What does the Seifa teach that we do not know from the Reisha?</p>
<p class="bas indent1"><span class="nm">(e)</span><span class="cl">Answer:</span> One might have thought that it does not help to immerse, because we leave a Tamei person in his Chazakah (status quo), and likewise we leave the loaf in its Chezkas Taharah. The Seifa teaches that this is not so.</p>
<p class="bas subject"><span class="nm">3)</span>ARE EDIM ZOMEMIM LASHED FOR <i>LO SA'ANEH</i>?</p>
<p class="bas indent1"><span class="nm">(a)</span><span class="cl">(Mishnah - R. Meir):</span> If Edim Zomemim testified that Reuven owes 200 Zuz, they are lashed and pay, for different verses obligate lashes and payment;</p>
<p class="bas indent1"><span class="nm">(b)</span>Chachamim say, anyone who pays is not lashed.</p>
<p class="bas indent1"><span class="nm">(c)</span>R. Meir says, if Edim Zomemim testified that Reuven is liable to receive 40 lashes, they receive 80 lashes, 40 for "Lo Sa'aneh", and 40 for "va'Asisem Lo Ka'asher Zamam";</p>
<p class="bas indent1"><span class="nm">(d)</span>Chachamim say, he is lashed only 40.</p>
<p class="bas bbbline">4b----------------------------------------4b</p>
<p class="bas indent1"><span class="nm">(e)</span><span class="cl">Version #1 (Gemara) Question:</span> Granted, Chachamim learn from "Kedei Rish'aso" that one receives only one punishment for his evil;</p>
<p class="bas indent2"><span class="nm">1.</span>Why does R. Meir argue?</p>
<p class="bas indent1"><span class="nm">(f)</span><span class="cl">Answer (Ula):</span> He learns from Motzi Shem Ra (a man who claims that his bride was not a virgin), who is lashed and pays (if we find that he lied).</p>
<p class="bas indent1"><span class="nm">(g)</span><span class="cl">Question:</span> We cannot learn from Motzi Shem Ra, for it is a Kenas!</p>
<p class="bas indent1"><span class="nm">(h)</span><span class="cl">Answer:</span> R. Meir holds like R. Akiva, who says that Edim Zomemim is a Kenas.</p>
<p class="bas indent1"><span class="nm">(i)</span><span class="cl">Version #2 (Beraisa - R. Yehudah):</span> "Lo Sosiru... (veha'Nosar... ba'Esh Tisrofu)" - the verse gives an Aseh to fix the Lav, therefore one is not lashed for it;</p>
<p class="bas indent1"><span class="nm">(j)</span><span class="cl">(R. Yakov):</span> No, one is not lashed because this Lav is transgressed without an action, one is not lashed for such Lavim;</p>
<p class="bas indent2"><span class="nm">1.</span><span class="cl">Inference:</span> R. Yehudah holds that one is lashed for such Lavim.</p>
<p class="bas indent1"><span class="nm">(k)</span><span class="cl">Question:</span> What is R. Yehudah's source?</p>
<p class="bas indent1"><span class="nm">(l)</span><span class="cl">Answer #1 (Ula):</span> He learns from Motzi Shem Ra, who did not do an action, yet he is lashed.</p>
<p class="bas indent1"><span class="nm">(m)</span><span class="cl">Question:</span> We cannot learn from Motzi Shem Ra, for he is lashed and pays (unlike other Aveiros)!</p>
<p class="bas indent1"><span class="nm">(n)</span><span class="cl">Answer #2 (Reish Lakish):</span> He learns from Edim Zomemim, who did not do an action, yet they are lashed.</p>
<p class="bas indent1"><span class="nm">(o)</span><span class="cl">Question:</span> We cannot learn from Edim Zomemim. They are lashed without warning (unlike other Aveiros)!</p>
<p class="bas indent1"><span class="nm">(p)</span><span class="cl">Answer:</span> Motzi Shem Ra proves that this is not the reason (he did not do an action and he is lashed, even though he must be warned).</p>
<p class="bas indent2"><span class="nm">1.</span>Each has its own stringency unlike the other. We learn from the Tzad ha'Shavah (common side) of them. They did not do an action, yet they are lashed. Likewise, one is lashed for any Lav without an action.</p>
<p class="bas indent1"><span class="nm">(q)</span><span class="cl">Question:</span> We cannot learn from the Tzad ha'Shavah, for both the sources (Motzi Shem Ra and Edim Zomemim) are Kenasos!</p>
<p class="bas indent1"><span class="nm">(r)</span><span class="cl">Answer:</span> R. Yehudah says that Edim Zomemim is not a Kenas. He argues with R. Akiva.</p>
<p class="bas indent1"><span class="nm">(s)</span><span class="cl">Question:</span> We cannot learn from the Tzad ha'Shavah, for both the sources have stringencies not found in other Aveiros!</p>
<p class="bas indent1"><span class="nm">(t)</span><span class="cl">Answer:</span> R. Yehudah learns from a Tzad ha'Shavah even in such a case.</p>
<p class="bas subject"><span class="nm">4)</span>HOW CHACHAMIM EXPOUND <i>LO SA'ANEH</i></p>
<p class="bas indent1"><span class="nm">(a)</span><span class="cl">Question:</span> What do Chachamim expound from "Lo Sa'aneh"?</p>
<p class="bas indent1"><span class="nm">(b)</span><span class="cl">Answer:</span> It is a warning to Edim Zomemim.(without a warning, they would not be lashed).</p>
<p class="bas indent1"><span class="nm">(c)</span><span class="cl">Question:</span> According to R. Meir, what is the warning to Edim Zomemim?</p>
<p class="bas indent1"><span class="nm">(d)</span><span class="cl">Answer (R. Yirmeyah):</span> It is "veha'Nish'arim Yishme'u v'Yira'u v'Lo Yosifu (La'asos Od ka'Davar ha'Ra ha'Zeh)."</p>
<p class="bas indent2"><span class="nm">1.</span>Chachamim use this to teach that we announce before killing Edim Zomemim.</p>
<p class="bas indent2"><span class="nm">2.</span>R. Meir learns this from "Yishme'u v'Yira'u."</p>
