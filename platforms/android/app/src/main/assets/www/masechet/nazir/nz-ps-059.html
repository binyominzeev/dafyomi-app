<p class="bas indent1"><span class="nm">(a)</span><span class="cl">Version #2 (R. Chiya bar Aba):</span> One who shaves his underarms or his genitals is lashed, for it says "a man will not wear a woman's garment." (This includes adorning himself like a woman.)</p>
<p class="bas indent1"><span class="nm">(b)</span><span class="cl">Question (Beraisa):</span> Removing hair (in these areas) is forbidden only mid'Rabanan.</p>
<p class="bas indent1"><span class="nm">(c)</span><span class="cl">Answer:</span> R. Chiya bar Aba holds like the following Tana:</p>
<p class="bas indent2"><span class="nm">1.</span><span class="cl">(Beraisa):</span> One who shaves his underarms or his genitals transgresses "a man will not wear a woman's garment."</p>
<p class="bas indent1"><span class="nm">(d)</span><span class="cl">Question:</span> The Tana that says that the Isur is only mid'Rabanan. How does he expound "a man will not wear the garment of a woman"?</p>
<p class="bas indent1"><span class="nm">(e)</span><span class="cl">Answer (Beraisa) Question:</span> What do we learn from "a man's garment will not be on a woman"?</p>
<p class="bas indent2"><span class="nm">1.</span><span class="cl">Suggestion:</span> It forbids a woman to wear a man's garment, and (the end of the verse, cited above, forbids) vice-versa.</p>
<p class="bas indent2"><span class="nm">2.</span><span class="cl">Rejection:</span> The Torah called this an abomination (and this is not an abomination)!</p>
<p class="bas indent2"><span class="nm">3.</span><span class="cl">Answer #1:</span> Rather, a man may not wear a woman's garment and sit among women, or vice-versa;</p>
<p class="bas indent2"><span class="nm">4.</span><span class="cl">Answer #2 (R. Eliezer ben Yakov):</span> "A man's garment will not be on a woman" forbids a woman to bear weapons in war. "A man will not wear a woman's garment" forbids a man to adorn himself like women do.</p>

<p class="bas subject"><span class="nm">2)</span>A SAFEK TAMEI NAZIR</p>
<p class="bas indent1"><span class="nm">(a)</span><span class="cl">(Mishnah - R. Yehoshua):</span> If Levi or another Nazir became Tamei (we do not know which) and the other one died, Levi should find someone willing to accept Nezirus on condition;</p>
<p class="bas indent2"><span class="nm">1.</span>Levi says 'if I am Tamei, you are a Nazir starting now. If I am Tahor, you will be a Nazir after 30 days.'</p>
<p class="bas indent2"><span class="nm">2.</span>They observe 30 days of Nezirus. They bring (together) Korbanos of a Tamei Nazir and the Korbanos of a Tahor Nazir. Levi stipulates: if I was Tamei, the Korbanos Nazir Tamei are for me, and the Korbanos Nazir Tahor are for you. If I was Tahor, the Korbanos Nazir Tahor are for me, the Korbanos Nazir Tamei were brought due to the doubt.</p>
<p class="bas indent2"><span class="nm">3.</span>They observe another 30 days of Nezirus. They bring (together) Korbanos Nazir Tahor. Levi stipulates: if I was Tamei, these Korbanos are for me. If I was Tahor, these Korbanos are for you.</p>
<p class="bas indent1"><span class="nm">(b)</span><span class="cl">Objection (Ben Zoma):</span> Who will consent to accept Nezirus on such conditions?!</p>
<p class="bas indent2"><span class="nm">1.</span>Rather, the surviving Nazir brings (after 30 days) Chatas ha'Of and Olas Beheimah. He stipulates: if I was Tamei, I fulfill my obligation with the Chatas, and the Olah is a Nedavah (voluntary Korban). If I was Tahor, I fulfill my obligation with the Olah, and the Chatas was due to the doubt.</p>
<p class="bas indent2"><span class="nm">2.</span>He observes another 30 days of Nezirus and brings the Korbanos of a Tahor Nazir. He stipulates: if I was Tamei, I fulfill my current obligation (of a Tahor Nazir) with these Korbanos;</p>
<p class="bas indent2"><span class="nm">3.</span>If I was Tahor, I already fulfilled my obligation to bring an Olah; the current Olah is a Nedavah offering, and the other Korbanos I bring to complete the obligatory Korbanos of a Tahor Nazir.</p>
