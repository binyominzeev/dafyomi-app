<p class="bas indent1"><span class="nm">(a)</span><span class="cl">(Mishnah):</span> If one did not grind the cumin before Shabbos...</p>
<p class="bas indent1"><span class="nm">(b)</span><span class="cl">(Beraisa):</span> Things which may not be done for Milah on Shabbos may be done on Yom Tov, i.e. grinding cumin and mixing wine and oil.</p>
<p class="bas indent1"><span class="nm">(c)</span><span class="cl">Question (Abaye):</span> Presumably, one may grind cumin on Yom Tov because it is fit to add to a Tavshil [to spice it] - wine and oil are also fitting on Shabbos for a Choleh (one who is mildly sick)!</p>
<p class="bas indent2"><span class="nm">1.</span><span class="cl">(Beraisa):</span> One may not mix wine and oil for a Choleh on Shabbos;</p>
<p class="bas indent2"><span class="nm">2.</span>R. Shimon ben Elazar says that R. Meir permits.</p>
<p class="bas indent2"><span class="nm">3.</span><span class="cl">R. Shimon ben Elazar:</span> Once R. Meir had intestinal pain, we wanted to mix wine and oil for him - he did not allow us.</p>
<p class="bas indent3"><span class="nm">i.</span><span class="cl">His Talmidim:</span> If you do not rely on your opinion, it will become Batul (everyone will follow Chachamim)!</p>
<p class="bas indent3"><span class="nm">ii.</span><span class="cl">R. Meir:</span> Even though I say one way and my colleagues argue, I never dared transgress their words.</p>
<p class="bas indent2"><span class="nm">4.</span><span class="cl">Summation of question:</span> This was R. Meir's stringency, but he permits others! (Presumably, our Stam Mishnah is like R. Meir.)</p>
<p class="bas indent1"><span class="nm">(d)</span><span class="cl">Answer:</span> They are not mixed thoroughly for a Choleh - they must be mixed thoroughly for the sake of Milah.</p>
<p class="bas indent1"><span class="nm">(e)</span><span class="cl">Question:</span> [For Milah, the Mishnah only allows putting them on separately -] we should be allowed to mix them like for a Choleh!</p>
<p class="bas indent1"><span class="nm">(f)</span><span class="cl">Answer:</span> Indeed, this is what the Mishnah means when it says 'He puts the wine on by itself and the oil on by itself'! (If they are not mixed well, almost all the oil will be on top, it is like putting them on separately.)</p>
<p class="bas indent1"><span class="nm">(g)</span><span class="cl">(Beraisa):</span> [On Yom Tov] one may not strain mustard in a mustard strainer; one may not sweeten it with a coal (by extinguishing the coal in it).</p>
<p class="bas indent1"><span class="nm">(h)</span><span class="cl">Question (Abaye):</span> Why is this different than putting an egg in a mustard strainer, which a Mishnah permits?</p>
<p class="bas indent1"><span class="nm">(i)</span><span class="cl">Answer (Rav Yosef):</span> That does not look like Borer (all of the egg passes through) - this looks like Borer (it is not really Borer, since also the Pesoles is edible).</p>
<p class="bas indent1"><span class="nm">(j)</span><span class="cl">(Beraisa #1):</span> One may not sweeten it with a coal.</p>
<p class="bas indent1"><span class="nm">(k)</span><span class="cl">Contradiction (Beraisa #2):</span> One may sweeten it with a coal.</p>
<p class="bas indent1"><span class="nm">(l)</span><span class="cl">Answer:</span> It is permitted with a metal coal (one is never liable for extinguishing it), it is forbidden with a coal from wood.</p>
<p class="bas indent1"><span class="nm">(m)</span><span class="cl">Question (Abaye):</span> Why is this different than roasting meat over coals (even though this extinguishes them, it is permitted for the sake of Ochel Nefesh)!</p>
<p class="bas indent1"><span class="nm">(n)</span><span class="cl">Answer (Rav Yosef):</span> There, there is no alternative; here, there is. (Meat roasted from before Yom Tov is not as tasty - mustard sweetened before Yom Tov does not lose its taste.)</p>
<p class="bas indent1"><span class="nm">(o)</span><span class="cl">Question (Abaye):</span> May one make cheese?</p>
<p class="bas indent1"><span class="nm">(p)</span><span class="cl">Answer (Rav Yosef):</span> It is forbidden.</p>
<p class="bas indent1"><span class="nm">(q)</span><span class="cl">Question (Abaye):</span> Why is this different than kneading?</p>
<p class="bas indent1"><span class="nm">(r)</span><span class="cl">Answer (Rav Yosef):</span> There, there is no alternative; here, there is (a freshly baked dough is tastier - cheese made before Yom Tov is no worse than cheese made on Yom Tov);</p>
<p class="bas indent2"><span class="nm">1.</span>Chachamim of Neharda'a say that cheese is good on the day it was made - they mean, it is good <i>even</i> on the day it was made (it is even better if made before)!</p>
<p class="bas subject"><span class="nm">2)</span>TEACHINGS OF ABAYE'S MOTHER</p>
<p class="bas indent1"><span class="nm">(a)</span><span class="cl">(Mishnah):</span> One may not make a 'cloak' for the Ever.</p>
<p class="bas indent1"><span class="nm">(b)</span><span class="cl">Abaye's mother:</span> One should fold up the hem of the 'cloak' near the opening so it will not touch the Ever, lest strands stick to the wound and castrate the baby when it is removed).</p>
<p class="bas indent2"><span class="nm">1.</span>Abaye's [surrogate] mother made a pouch to go inside the cloak, reaching to half the cloak, to shield the wound from the strands of the hem.</p>
<p class="bas indent1"><span class="nm">(c)</span><span class="cl">(Abaye):</span> If there is no cloak for a Milah, one should bring a worn out garment with a hem (this helps it cling to the Ever) and turn it inside out (lest strands stick to the wound).</p>
<p class="bas indent1"><span class="nm">(d)</span><span class="cl">Abaye's mother:</span> If one cannot find a baby's anus, one should anoint him with oil and put him in the sun - [the hole is] where the oil is as clear as glass, he should tear it lengthwise and widthwise with the end of a barley;</p>
<p class="bas indent2"><span class="nm">1.</span>He should not use a metal Kli, it would swell it.</p>
<p class="bas indent1"><span class="nm">(e)</span><span class="cl">Abaye's mother:</span> If a baby cannot nurse, this is because his lips are too cold.</p>
<p class="bas indent1"><span class="nm">(f)</span><span class="cl">Question:</span> What is the remedy for this?</p>
<p class="bas indent1"><span class="nm">(g)</span><span class="cl">Answer:</span> One should put coals on a Kli, and put it by his mouth - his mouth will get warm and he will nurse.</p>
<p class="bas indent1"><span class="nm">(h)</span><span class="cl">Abaye's mother:</span> If a baby's chest does not move when he breathes (Rashi; Aruch - he does not urinate), one fans him, this will solve the problem.</p>
<p class="bas indent1"><span class="nm">(i)</span><span class="cl">Abaye's mother:</span> If a baby is not breathing well, one should bring the placenta born with him and smooth it on his skin.</p>
<p class="bas indent1"><span class="nm">(j)</span><span class="cl">Abaye's mother:</span> If a baby is too thin, one should bring the placenta born with him and smooth it on his skin from the thin side to the thick, and vice-versa if he is bloated.</p>
<p class="bas indent1"><span class="nm">(k)</span><span class="cl">Abaye's mother:</span> If a baby is red, this shows that his blood has not been absorbed (it is still between his skin and flesh) - one should delay Milah until his blood is absorbed [lest it all come out].</p>
<p class="bas indent2"><span class="nm">1.</span>If he is yellow, this shows that he does not have enough blood yet - one should delay Milah until he has enough blood.</p>
<p class="bas indent1"><span class="nm">(l)</span><span class="cl">(Beraisa - R. Noson):</span> I met two women, each had lost two sons through circumcision. The third babies were red and yellow, respectively. I counseled them to postpone the Milah until the blood was absorbed/came in - both babies survived, and were given my name.</p>

<p class="bas subject"><span class="nm">3)</span>WASHING THE BABY FOR THE <i>MILAH</i> ON SHABBOS</p>
<p class="bas indent1"><span class="nm">(a)</span><span class="cl">(Mishnah):</span> We may wash a baby before and after Milah; we sprinkle on him by hand, not from a Kli;</p>
<p class="bas indent1"><span class="nm">(b)</span>R. Elazar ben Azaryah says, one may wash a baby on the third day from Milah - "Va'Yhi va'Yom ha'Shelishi bi'Hyosam Ko'avim" (one is very weak on the third day).</p>
<p class="bas indent1"><span class="nm">(c)</span>We do not Mechalel Shabbos for [Milah of] a Safek [Nefel (stillborn baby)] or Androginus (one with male and female genitals);</p>
<p class="bas indent1"><span class="nm">(d)</span>R. Yehudah permits for an Androginus.</p>
<p class="bas indent1"><span class="nm">(e)</span><span class="cl">(Gemara) Question:</span> 'We may wash' connotes normally (why does the Seifa forbid from a Kli)?</p>
<p class="bas indent1"><span class="nm">(f)</span><span class="cl">Answer #1 (Rav Yehudah and Rabah bar Avuha):</span> The Seifa explains the Reisha:</p>
<p class="bas indent2"><span class="nm">1.</span>We may wash a baby before and after Milah - we sprinkle by hand, not from a Kli.</p>
<p class="bas indent1"><span class="nm">(g)</span><span class="cl">Objection: (Rava):</span> 'We may wash' connotes normally!</p>
<p class="bas indent1"><span class="nm">(h)</span><span class="cl">Answer #2 (Rava):</span> We may wash a baby before and after Milah - on the day of Milah we wash normally; on the third day, if it is Shabbos, we sprinkle by hand, not from a Kli.</p>
<p class="bas indent2"><span class="nm">1.</span>R. Elazar ben Azaryah permits washing [normally] on the third day - "Va'Yhi va'Yom ha'Shelishi..."</p>
<p class="bas indent1"><span class="nm">(i)</span><span class="cl">Support (for Rava - Beraisa):</span> We may wash a baby before and after Milah - on the day of Milah we wash normally; on the third day, if it is Shabbos, we sprinkle by hand;</p>
<p class="bas indent2"><span class="nm">1.</span>R. Elazar ben Azaryah permits washing [normally] on the third day if it is Shabbos - even though there is no proof, there is a hint - "Va'Yhi va'Yom ha'Shelishi..."</p>
<p class="bas indent2"><span class="nm">2.</span>We sprinkle by hand, not with a cup, bowl or Kli.</p>
<p class="bas indent2"><span class="nm">3.</span>This clause is according to the first Tana.</p>
<p class="bas indent1"><span class="nm">(j)</span><span class="cl">Question:</span> What does it mean 'Even though there is no proof, there is a hint'?</p>
<p class="bas indent1"><span class="nm">(k)</span><span class="cl">Answer:</span> It is not a proof because a baby's wound heals faster than an adult's.</p>
<p class="bas indent1"><span class="nm">(l)</span>A case occurred, and Rava permitted a man to wash normally on the first day. Rava became weak - he assumed that this was for ruling against Chachamim of the previous generation (Rav Yehudah and Rabah bar Avuha).</p>
<p class="bas indent1"><span class="nm">(m)</span><span class="cl">His Talmidim:</span> A Beraisa supports you!</p>
<p class="bas indent1"><span class="nm">(n)</span><span class="cl">Rava:</span> Our Mishnah supports them (Rashba - and the Beraisa is errant)!</p>
<p class="bas indent2"><span class="nm">1.</span><span class="cl">(Mishnah - R. Elazar ben Azaryah):</span> One may wash on the third day...</p>
<p class="bas indent2"><span class="nm">2.</span>If the first Tana permits only sprinkling, this is good (Maharsha - according to Rashi below (d'I Salka Da'atach, without Maharshal's correction) he permits even this only on the first two days - nevertheless, R. Elazar does not say '<i>even</i> on the third day', because the first Tana did not explicitly discuss the third day);</p>
<p class="bas indent2"><span class="nm">3.</span>But if the first Tana permits washing on the first day and sprinkling on the third, R. Elazar should have said 'We may <i>even</i> wash'!</p>
<p class="bas indent1"><span class="nm">(o)</span><span class="cl">(Rav Dimi):</span> The Halachah follows R. Elazar ben Azaryah.</p>
<p class="bas subject"><span class="nm">4)</span>WHAT IS PERMITTED FOR THE WOUND OF <i>MILAH</i> ON SHABBOS?</p>
<p class="bas indent1"><span class="nm">(a)</span><span class="cl">Question (Chachamim of Eretz Yisrael):</span> Is it permitted to wash the entire body, or just the wound?</p>
<p class="bas indent1"><span class="nm">(b)</span><span class="cl">Answer (R. Yakov):</span> One may put hot water on any wound - the Heter for Milah must be to wash the entire body.</p>
<p class="bas indent2"><span class="nm">1.</span><span class="cl">(Rav):</span> We do not refrain from putting hot water and oil on a wound on Shabbos.</p>
<p class="bas indent1"><span class="nm">(c)</span><span class="cl">Objection (Rav Yosef):</span> For a regular wound we may only use water heated from before Shabbos - for Milah, we may use water heated on Shabbos!</p>
<p class="bas indent1"><span class="nm">(d)</span><span class="cl">Objection to objection (Rav Dimi):</span> What is your source to say that they argue about using water heated on Shabbos - perhaps they discuss water heated from before Shabbos!</p>
<p class="bas indent1"><span class="nm">(e)</span><span class="cl">Abaye:</span> Rav Yosef answered this before I had the chance!</p>
<p class="bas indent1"><span class="nm">(f)</span><span class="cl">Answer (Rav Yosef):</span> There is mortal danger, surely we may use water heated on Shabbos!</p>
<p class="bas indent1"><span class="nm">(g)</span><span class="cl">(Ravin):</span> The Halachah follows R. Elazar ben Azaryah - it is permitted even if the water was heated on Shabbos, even to wash the entire body, for there is mortal danger.</p>
<p class="bas indent1"><span class="nm">(h)</span><span class="cl">(Rav):</span> We do not refrain from putting hot water and oil on a wound on Shabbos.</p>
<p class="bas indent1"><span class="nm">(i)</span><span class="cl">(Shmuel):</span> One puts next to the wound, it drips down into the wound.</p>
<p class="bas indent1"><span class="nm">(j)</span><span class="cl">Question (against Rav - Beraisa):</span> One may not put oil or hot water on a tuft to put on a wound on Shabbos (the decree against cures on Shabbos applies).</p>
<p class="bas indent1"><span class="nm">(k)</span><span class="cl">Answer:</span> No, it is forbidden on account of squeezing.</p>
<p class="bas indent1"><span class="nm">(l)</span><span class="cl">Question (against Rav - Beraisa):</span> One may not put oil or hot water on a tuft on a wound on Shabbos. (We should not be concerned for squeezing, since he need not move the tuft!)</p>
<p class="bas indent1"><span class="nm">(m)</span><span class="cl">Answer:</span> Also that is forbidden on account of squeezing.</p>
<p class="bas indent1"><span class="nm">(n)</span><span class="cl">Support (for Shmuel - Beraisa):</span> One may not put oil or hot water on a tuft on a wound on Shabbos; one puts next to the wound, it drips down into the wound.</p>
<p class="bas indent1"><span class="nm">(o)</span><span class="cl">(Beraisa):</span> One may put a dry tuft or sponge on a wound (so it will not get scratched), but not a dry Gemi (soft reed) or bits of garments (these heal).</p>
<p class="bas indent1"><span class="nm">(p)</span><span class="cl">Question:</span> The Beraisa contradicts itself regarding bits of garments (these are tufts)!</p>
<p class="bas indent1"><span class="nm">(q)</span><span class="cl">Answer:</span> New tufts (that were never on a wound) are forbidden, old ones are permitted.</p>
<p class="bas indent1"><span class="nm">(r)</span><span class="cl">(Abaye):</span> This teaches that [new] tufts heal.</p>
