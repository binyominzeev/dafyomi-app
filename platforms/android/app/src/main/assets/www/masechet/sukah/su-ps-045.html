<div class="indent1"><span class="nm">(a)</span><p>Aravos were brought from Motza and arranged around the Mizbe'ach with their points bent over the Mizbe'ach.</p></div>
<div class="indent1"><span class="nm">(b)</span><p>The Shofar was blown.</p></div>
<div class="indent1"><span class="nm">(c)</span><p>Each day the Kohanim circled the Mizbe'ach once and said Ana Hash-m.</p></div>
<div class="indent1"><span class="nm">(d)</span><p><span class="cl">(R. Yehudah):</span> They said Ani Vahu.</p></div>
<div class="indent1"><span class="nm">(e)</span><p>On the seventh day they circled the Mizbe'ach seven times.</p></div>
<div class="indent1"><span class="nm">(f)</span><p>They bid farewell to the Mizbe'ach with Yofi Lecha.</p></div>
<div class="indent1"><span class="nm">(g)</span><p><span class="cl">(R. Eliezer):</span> They said 'l'Kah u'Lecha Mizbe'ach.'</p></div>
<div class="indent1"><span class="nm">(h)</span><p>The same procedure was followed on weekdays and Shabbos (but the Aravos were brought and preserved in water from before Shabbos).</p></div>
<div class="indent1"><span class="nm">(i)</span><p><span class="cl">(R. Yochanan b. Beroka):</span> Palm branches were brought and beaten on the base of the Mizbe'ach, giving the day its name, Chavot Charayos.</p></div>

<div class="subject"><span class="nm">2)</span><p>MOTZA</p></div>
<div class="indent1"><span class="nm">(a)</span><p>Motza was also called Kalni'a.</p></div>
<div class="indent1"><span class="nm">(b)</span><p><span class="cl">Question:</span> Why does our Tana call it Motza.</p></div>
<div class="indent1"><span class="nm">(c)</span><p><span class="cl">Answer:</span> Because it was excluded from government taxes.</p></div>
<div class="subject"><span class="nm">3)</span><p>MANY LONG ARAVOS</p></div>
<div class="indent1"><span class="nm">(a)</span><p>The Aravos were 11 Amos tall in order to lean over the Mizbe'ach one Amah.</p></div>
<div class="indent1"><span class="nm">(b)</span><p><span class="cl">(Mereimar citing Mar Zutra):</span> We thus see that the Aravos were resting on the Yesod (not on the floor).</p></div>
<div class="indent2"><span class="nm">1.</span><p>The Mizbe'ach rose an Amah from the floor and indented to form the Yesod.</p></div>
<div class="indent2"><span class="nm">2.</span><p>Five Amos higher it indented again to form the Sovev.</p></div>
<div class="indent2"><span class="nm">3.</span><p>Three Amos higher it indented again to from the Gag of the Mizbe'ach, with corners which rose up another Amah.</p></div>
<div class="indent2"><span class="nm">4.</span><p>Thus in order to bend naturally onto the Mizbe'ach the Aravos must have been standing on the Yesod.</p></div>
<div class="indent1"><span class="nm">(c)</span><p><span class="cl">Question (R. Avahu):</span> On what basis must the Aravos be taller than the roof of the Mizbe'ach?</p></div>

<div class="indent1"><span class="nm">(b)</span><p>Omdim also teaches that the Kerashim support their gold plating.</p></div>
<div class="indent1"><span class="nm">(c)</span><p>It also teaches that they are eternal.</p></div>

<div class="indent1"><span class="nm">(b)</span><p><span class="cl">Answer (R. Huna):</span> The plural Kapos implies one for Lulav and one for the Mizbe'ach (the Rabanan disagree since the word is written as though it were singular).</p></div>
<div class="indent1"><span class="nm">(c)</span><p><span class="cl">Answer (R. Levi):</span> It is from a Sevara, not a Pasuk (emphasizing the single hearted commitment of Klal Yisrael to Hash-m).</p></div>

<div class="indent1"><span class="nm">(a)</span><p><span class="cl">(R. Yehudah citing Shmuel):</span> The Berachah is recited over the Lulav each of the seven days, but only once over the Sukah.</p></div>
<div class="indent2"><span class="nm">1.</span><p><span class="cl">Question:</span> What is the reason?</p></div>
<div class="indent2"><span class="nm">2.</span><p><span class="cl">Answer:</span> Lulav (unlike Sukah) has an new obligation each day since there is no Mitzvah at night.</p></div>

<div class="indent2"><span class="nm">2.</span><p><span class="cl">Answer:</span> Sukah is d'Oraisa all seven days while Lulav is d'Oraisa (outside the Mikdash) only on the first day (the rest are Zecher l'Mikdash).</p></div>
<div class="indent1"><span class="nm">(c)</span><p><span class="cl">(Ravin citing R. Yochanan):</span> They are both recited each of the seven days.</p></div>
<div class="indent1"><span class="nm">(d)</span><p><span class="cl">(R. Yosef):</span> Adopt the position of Rabah bar bar Chanah since even Ravin agrees with him regarding Sukah.</p></div>
