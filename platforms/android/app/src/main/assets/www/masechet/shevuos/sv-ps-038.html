<p class="dedicationbox">SHEVUOS 38 (18 Teves) - Two weeks of study material have been dedicated by Mrs. Estanne Abraham Fawer to honor the Yahrzeit of her father, Rav Mordechai ben Eliezer Zvi (Rabbi Morton Weiner) Z'L, who passed away on 18 Teves 5760. May the merit of supporting and advancing Dafyomi study -- which was so important to him -- during the weeks of his Yahrzeit serve as an Iluy for his Neshamah. </p>

<p class="bas subject"><span class="nm">1)</span>COLLECTIVE AND INDIVIDUAL OATHS</p>
<p class="bas indent1"><span class="nm">(a)</span><span class="cl">(Mishnah):</span> Shevu'as ha'Pikadon is when Shimon told Levi 'give to me the deposit you are holding for me...'</p>
<p class="bas indent1"><span class="nm">(b)</span><span class="cl">(Beraisa - R. Meir):</span> One who takes a collective (all-inclusive) oath is liable once. If he takes individual oaths, he is liable for each one.</p>
<p class="bas indent1"><span class="nm">(c)</span>R. Yehudah says, if he said 'I swear that you do not have a deposit by me, and not you, and not you... ' he is liable for each one.</p>
<p class="bas indent1"><span class="nm">(d)</span>R. Eliezer says, if he said (Ramban - swore) 'not you, and not you, and not you - Shevu'ah' he is liable for each one.</p>
<p class="bas indent1"><span class="nm">(e)</span>R. Shimon says, he is liable for each only if he said 'Shevu'ah' to each.</p>
<p class="bas indent1"><span class="nm">(f)</span><span class="cl">(Shmuel):</span> When he says '<i>and</i> not you' to each one (after the first), R. Meir calls this a collective oath, and R. Yehudah calls it individual oaths. When he says 'not you' to each one, R. Meir calls this individual oaths, R. Yehudah calls it a collective oath.</p>
<p class="bas indent1"><span class="nm">(g)</span><span class="cl">(R. Yochanan):</span> All agree that when he says '<i>and</i> not you', these are individual oaths;</p>
<p class="bas indent2"><span class="nm">1.</span>They argue in a case that he says 'not you' to each. R. Meir calls this individual oaths, and R. Yehudah calls it a collective oath.</p>
<p class="bas indent2"><span class="nm">2.</span><span class="cl">Question:</span> According to R. Meir, what is a collective oath?</p>
<p class="bas indent2"><span class="nm">3.</span><span class="cl">Answer:</span> He says 'I swear that you (plural) do not have a deposit by me.'</p>
<p class="bas indent1"><span class="nm">(h)</span><span class="cl">Question:</span> Why do Shmuel and R. Yochanan argue?</p>
<p class="bas indent1"><span class="nm">(i)</span><span class="cl">Answer:</span> Shmuel learns from the Beraisa, and R. Yochanan learns from the Mishnah.</p>
<p class="bas indent2"><span class="nm">1.</span>Shmuel learns from the Beraisa. Since R. Yehudah says that 'and not you, and not you...' are individual oaths, he must know that R. Meir considers this a collective oath.</p>
<p class="bas indent2"><span class="nm">2.</span>R. Yochanan explains that R. Meir considers them individual oaths with or without '<i>and</i>', and R. Yehudah says 'I agree with you only when he says 'and'.</p>
<p class="bas indent2"><span class="nm">3.</span>Shmuel holds that if so, R. Yehudah would rather teach the case in which he argues with R. Meir!</p>
<p class="bas indent1"><span class="nm">(j)</span>R. Yochanan learns from the Mishnah. (Since the first Tana is anonymous, we assume that it is R. Meir.) Since it says that 'I swear that you (plural) do not have a deposit by me' is a collective oath, we infer that 'and not you' would be individual oaths;</p>
<p class="bas indent2"><span class="nm">1.</span>If it were a collective oath, the Tana should have taught this, and all the more so we would know that 'you (plural) do not have by me'! (We prefer to infer from the Reisha, even though the Seifa teaches this explicitly, for opinions differ about the text of the Seifa, like we bring below.)</p>
<p class="bas indent2"><span class="nm">2.</span>Shmuel disagrees. R. Meir considers 'and not you, and not you' to be just like 'you (plural) do not have by me' (both are collective oaths). It is not a bigger Chidush.</p>
<p class="bas indent1"><span class="nm">(k)</span><span class="cl">Question (against Shmuel - Mishnah):</span> If he swore 'you do not (have a deposit by me), <i>and</i> not you, <i>and</i> not you... ', the Shomer is liable for each one. (Tosfos - in these questions, all 'and's, except for the last, should be deleted from the text.)</p>
<p class="bas indent1"><span class="nm">(l)</span><span class="cl">Answer #1:</span> The text should read '... not you.'</p>
<p class="bas indent1"><span class="nm">(m)</span><span class="cl">Question (against Shmuel - Mishnah):</span> If he claimed a deposit and loan... (and the Shomer swore 'I do not have of yours a deposit, <i>and</i> (not) a loan, <i>and</i> (not) theft <i>and</i> (not) an Aveidah', he is liable for each one).</p>
<p class="bas indent1"><span class="nm">(n)</span><span class="cl">Answer #1:</span> The text should read '... (not) a loan, (not) theft, (not) an Aveidah.'</p>
<p class="bas indent1"><span class="nm">(o)</span><span class="cl">Question (against Shmuel - Mishnah):</span> If he claimed wheat and barley... (and the Shomer swore 'I do not have of yours wheat, <i>and</i> (not) barley, <i>and</i> (not) spelt', he is liable for each one).</p>
<p class="bas indent1"><span class="nm">(p)</span><span class="cl">Answer #1:</span> The text should read '... (not) barley, (not) spelt.'</p>
<p class="bas indent1"><span class="nm">(q)</span><span class="cl">Objection:</span> We cannot say that there are so many mistakes in the text!</p>
<p class="bas indent1"><span class="nm">(r)</span><span class="cl">Answer #2 (to all three questions):</span> The Tana is Rebbi.</p>
<p class="bas indent2"><span class="nm">1.</span><span class="cl">(Rebbi):</span> (While a Kohen was offering a Korban, he expressed intent to eat part when it is Nosar (i.e. after the allotted time), and part outside the permitted place. If the intent for Nosar <i>preceded</i> the intent to eat outside, the Korban is Pigul (an abomination; one who eats it, even in the permitted time and place, gets Kares). If not, the Korban is Pasul (there is no Kares for eating it. This is like R. Yehudah's opinion about Pigul.) Whether he said '(I will eat) a k'Zayis (Nosar), a k'Zayis (outside)' or 'a k'Zayis (Nosar) <i>and</i> a k'Zayis (outside)', these are individual intents, and the Korban is Pigul. (If they were considered one collective intent, since the intents come at the same time, it would be only Pasul.)</p>
<p class="bas indent1"><span class="nm">(s)</span><span class="cl">Question (against Shmuel - Mishnah - R. Meir):</span> Even if he said 'wheat <i>and</i> barley <i>and</i> spelt' in the singular forms of these words, he is liable for each one.</p>
<p class="bas indent1"><span class="nm">(t)</span><span class="cl">Answer:</span> The text should read (the standard plural forms of the words) 'wheat, barley, spelt.'</p>
<p class="bas indent2"><span class="nm">1.</span><span class="cl">Question:</span> What is the special Chidush (to warrant saying <i>even</i>? Presumably, the only difference in R. Meir's text of the vow is the singular forms of wheat, barley and spelt, but not regarding 'and.')</p>
<p class="bas indent2"><span class="nm">2.</span><span class="cl">Version #1 (Rashi) Answer (Rav Acha brei d'Rav Ika):</span> Even though the claimant used the singular forms, we do not say that he claimed only a single kernel of each (which is not worth a Perutah). The singular forms also refer to larger amounts.</p>
<p class="bas indent2"><span class="nm">3.</span><span class="cl">Version #2 (Ri mi'Gash, brought in Ramban) Answer (Rav Acha brei d'Rav Ika):</span> One might have thought that the <i>defendant</i> used the singular forms to make clear that he does not owe even a single kernel of any of these (but he did not intend to take individual oaths). R. Meir teaches that this is not so.</p>
<p class="bas subject"><span class="nm">2)</span>DOES HE ALSO TAKE A COLLECTIVE OATH?</p>
<p class="bas indent1"><span class="nm">(a)</span><span class="cl">(Mishnah):</span> If he claimed a deposit, loan...</p>
<p class="bas indent1"><span class="nm">(b)</span><span class="cl">(R. Yochanan):</span> If Shimon claimed from Levi 'give to me (my) wheat and barley', all of them combine to a Perutah (to be liable for a false Shevu'as ha'Pikadon).</p>
<p class="bas indent1"><span class="nm">(c)</span><span class="cl">(Rav Acha or Ravina):</span> The clause of the Mishnah that teaches individual oaths ('you do not have wheat <i>and</i> barley <i>and</i> spelt') does not include a collective oath. (R. Yochanan teaches about a collective oath.)</p>
<p class="bas indent1"><span class="nm">(d)</span><span class="cl">(The other of Rav Acha or Ravina):</span> The clause of individual oaths also includes a collective oath (one is liable for each Min, and also for all combined. R. Yochanan's teaching applies also to the clause of individual oaths.)</p>
<p class="bas indent1"><span class="nm">(e)</span><span class="cl">Question (Beraisa #1 - R. Chiya):</span> (If one swore to deny 'wheat, barley and spelt, not to you and not you and not you and not you and not you',) he is liable 15 Korbanos Chatas (for three individual oaths to each of five people). According to the latter opinion, he should (be liable also for a collective oath (for all the Minim) to each person, and) bring 20 Chata'os! (Rashi - R. Chiya was not so precise. He brings Korbanos <i>Asham</i>. Tosfos - he discusses liability of witnesses for Shevu'as ha'Edus. They bring Chata'os.) (<i>Perhaps</i> this explains why we discuss 20, i.e. we do not include collective oaths for all the people together - <b>PF</b>.)</p>
<p class="bas indent1"><span class="nm">(f)</span><span class="cl">Answer:</span> R. Chiya teaches liability only for the individual oaths.</p>
<p class="bas indent1"><span class="nm">(g)</span><span class="cl">Support (and question against the first opinion - Beraisa #2 - R. Chiya):</span> He is liable 20 Chatas offerings. (We must say that Beraisa #1 teaches liability only for the individual oaths, and Beraisa #2 teaches liability also for the collective oaths!)</p>
<p class="bas indent1"><span class="nm">(h)</span><span class="cl">Rejection (and answer):</span> In Beraisa #2, he took four individual oaths to each person (denying a deposit, loan, theft and Aveidah).</p>
<p class="bas indent1"><span class="nm">(i)</span><span class="cl">Question (Rava):</span> If five people claimed from Levi a deposit, loan, stolen object and lost object, and he said to one 'I swear that I do not have of yours a deposit, loan, theft and Aveidah', and to the others 'and not to you, and not to you...', what is the law?</p>
<p class="bas indent2"><span class="nm">1.</span>Is he is liable only once for each of the last four people (because 'and not to you' does not refer to the individual oaths, only to a collective oath)?</p>
<p class="bas bbbline">38b----------------------------------------38b</p>
<p class="bas indent2"><span class="nm">2.</span>Or, is he liable for all the individual oaths to everyone?</p>
<p class="bas indent1"><span class="nm">(j)</span><span class="cl">Answer (Beraisa #2 - R. Chiya):</span> He is liable 20 Chatas offerings.</p>
<p class="bas indent2"><span class="nm">1.</span><span class="cl">Question:</span> What is the case?</p>
<p class="bas indent3"><span class="nm">i.</span><span class="cl">Suggestion:</span> He explicitly said the individual oaths to each person.</p>
<p class="bas indent3"><span class="nm">ii.</span><span class="cl">Rejection:</span> R. Chiya need not teach us mere multiplication!</p>
<p class="bas indent2"><span class="nm">2.</span><span class="cl">Answer:</span> Rather, he specified the individual oaths only to the first person (and he is liable for them for everyone).</p>
<p class="bas subject"><span class="nm">3)</span>ONE WHO DENIES A FINE</p>
<p class="bas indent1"><span class="nm">(a)</span><span class="cl">(Mishnah):</span> If he said 'you raped or enticed my daughter...' (and he denied... R. Shimon exempts, for even if he admitted, he would not pay the fine.)</p>
<p class="bas indent1"><span class="nm">(b)</span><span class="cl">Question (R. Chiya bar Aba):</span> What is R. Shimon's reason?</p>
<p class="bas indent1"><span class="nm">(c)</span><span class="cl">Answer #1 (R. Chiya bar Aba):</span> He holds that the primary claim is the fine (not the embarrassment and Pegam).</p>
<p class="bas indent1"><span class="nm">(d)</span><span class="cl">(Rava):</span> A parable explains R. Shimon's reasoning. Reuven claimed from Levi wheat, barley and spelt. Levi swore 'I do not have wheat of yours.' This was true, but he did have Reuven's barley and spelt. He is exempt, for he swore truthfully about the wheat.</p>
<p class="bas indent1"><span class="nm">(e)</span><span class="cl">Rejection (Abaye):</span> In your parable, Levi denied only wheat. In the Mishnah, he denied liability for anything!</p>
<p class="bas indent1"><span class="nm">(f)</span><span class="cl">(Abaye):</span> Rather, the Mishnah is like when Reuven claimed from Levi wheat, barley and spelt, and Levi swore 'you do not have anything by me.' Levi did not have Reuven's wheat, but he did have his barley and spelt. He is liable! (R. Shimon's opinion is difficult.)</p>
<p class="bas indent1"><span class="nm">(g)</span><span class="cl">Answer #2 (Ravin):</span> R. Shimon exempts because he holds that the claimant claims <i>only</i> the fine;</p>
<p class="bas indent2"><span class="nm">1.</span>Chachamim says, he claims also the embarrassment and Pegam.</p>
<p class="bas indent1"><span class="nm">(h)</span><span class="cl">Question:</span> What do the Tana'im argue about?</p>
<p class="bas indent1"><span class="nm">(i)</span><span class="cl">Answer (Rav Papa):</span> R. Shimon holds that one claims something that is a fixed amount (a fine), and not something variable;</p>
<p class="bas indent2"><span class="nm">1.</span>Chachamim hold that one would not omit claiming something that the defendant is liable for through his own admission, and claim only something for which the defendant can exempt himself through admitting.</p>

<p class="bas subject"><span class="nm">4)</span>THE ADMISSION MUST BE LIKE THE CLAIM</p>
<p class="bas indent1"><span class="nm">(a)</span><span class="cl">(Mishnah):</span> In Shevu'as ha'Dayanim (the oath for partial admission), the claim must be at least two (Ma'os) of Kesef (a third of a Dinar), and the admission must be at least a Perutah;</p>
<p class="bas indent2"><span class="nm">1.</span>If the admission is not the same Min that was claimed, the defendant is exempt (from paying and from swearing).</p>
<p class="bas indent1"><span class="nm">(b)</span>If Reuven claimed two Ma'os of Kesef (a Ma'ah is 32 Perutos, a sixth of a Dinar), and Shimon admitted that he owes a Perutah, Shimon is exempt;</p>

<p class="bas indent1"><span class="nm">(e)</span>If Reuven claimed 'you owed my father a Maneh (and I inherited it)', and Shimon admitted that he owed 50 Dinarim, he (pays 50 and) need not swear, for he is like one who returns an Aveidah.</p>

<p class="bas indent1"><span class="nm">(i)</span>If Reuven claimed a gold Dinar,Trisis, Pundyon or Perutah (a smaller coin), and Shimon admitted that he owes a silver Dinar, Shimon must (pay it and) swear, for all coins are considered to be one Min.</p>

<p class="bas indent1"><span class="nm">(l)</span>If Reuven claimed wheat, and Shimon admitted that he owes barley, Shimon is exempt;</p>
<p class="bas indent1"><span class="nm">(m)</span>Raban Gamliel obligates (to pay the barley and swear, even though they are different Minim).</p>
<p class="bas indent1"><span class="nm">(n)</span>Admon says, If Reuven claimed barrels of oil, and Shimon admitted that he owes (empty) barrels, Shimon must (pay them and) swear, for he admitted to part of what was claimed;</p>

<p class="bas indent1"><span class="nm">(p)</span>If Reuven claimed Kelim and land, and Shimon admitted to (all) the land but denied the Kelim, or admitted to (all) the Kelim but denied the land, he is exempt (an admission to land cannot obligate an oath, and we do not make a primary oath about land);</p>

<p class="bas indent1"><span class="nm">(b)</span><span class="cl">Answer (Rav Yehudah):</span> We make him swear like we find in the Torah. Avraham imposed an oath on Eliezer "ba'Shem Elokei ha'Shamayim."</p>
