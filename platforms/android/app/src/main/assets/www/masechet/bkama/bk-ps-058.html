<p class="bas subject"><span class="nm">1)</span>WHEN AN ANIMAL PAYS AS MUCH AS IT BENEFITED</p>
<p class="bas indent1"><span class="nm">(a)</span><span class="cl">Answer:</span> No, rather Rav teaches a bigger Chidush;</p>
<p class="bas indent2"><span class="nm">1.</span>It pays the benefit not only when it ate, rather, even when it fell on fruits. We do not say that Reuven is exempt because the fruits merely 'chased away a lion' (prevented damage).</p>
<p class="bas indent1"><span class="nm">(b)</span><span class="cl">Question:</span> Why don't we say this?</p>
<p class="bas indent1"><span class="nm">(c)</span><span class="cl">Answer #1:</span> That exemption is only when he intended to prevent damage. Here, he did not.</p>
<p class="bas indent1"><span class="nm">(d)</span><span class="cl">Answer #2:</span> That exemption is only when the chaser did not suffer a loss. Here, he lost.</p>
<p class="bas indent1"><span class="nm">(e)</span><span class="cl">Question:</span> How did the animal fall?</p>
<p class="bas indent1"><span class="nm">(f)</span><span class="cl">Answer #1 (Rav Kahana):</span> It slipped on its urine.</p>
<p class="bas indent1"><span class="nm">(g)</span><span class="cl">Answer #2 (Rava):</span> Another animal (of Reuven) pushed it.</p>
<p class="bas indent2"><span class="nm">1.</span>Rava agrees that all the more so if it slipped on its urine, it pays (only) the benefit.</p>
<p class="bas indent2"><span class="nm">2.</span>Rav Kahana would say that if another animal pushed it, it pays the damage. They should have been led single file. It was negligence to lead them side by side.</p>
<p class="bas indent1"><span class="nm">(h)</span><span class="cl">(Rav Kahana):</span> It pays (only) the benefit in the patch it fell into. If it entered another patch, it pays the damage.</p>
<p class="bas indent1"><span class="nm">(i)</span><span class="cl">(R. Yochanan):</span> Even if it entered another patch, even if it eats all day long, it only pays the benefit, until it leaves and returns with his knowledge.</p>
<p class="bas indent1"><span class="nm">(j)</span><span class="cl">(Rav Papa):</span> He does not mean that Reuven found out and did not lock it up properly (minimal guarding). Rather, once he finds out that it left, even if he locks it properly (he is liable if it returns).</p>
<p class="bas indent1"><span class="nm">(k)</span><span class="cl">Question:</span> What is the reason?</p>
<p class="bas indent1"><span class="nm">(l)</span><span class="cl">Answer:</span> Once it found a place to eat, it will return whenever it can (so it must be guarded well).</p>
<p class="bas subject"><span class="nm">2)</span>ONES AT THE END</p>
<p class="bas indent1"><span class="nm">(a)</span><span class="cl">(Mishnah):</span> If it entered normally, it pays the damage.</p>
<p class="bas indent1"><span class="nm">(b)</span><span class="cl">Question (R. Yirmiyah):</span> If it entered normally and damaged through natal water, what is the law?</p>
<p class="bas indent2"><span class="nm">1.</span>According to the opinion that only one who was negligent at the beginning and Ones at the end, surely he is liable;</p>
<p class="bas indent2"><span class="nm">2.</span>The question is according to the opinion that exempts negligence at the beginning when the end was Ones:</p>
<p class="bas indent3"><span class="nm">i.</span>Here also, he was negligent at the beginning and Ones at the end, so he is exempt;</p>
<p class="bas indent3"><span class="nm">ii.</span>Or, perhaps this is all negligence. Since he knew that it would give birth soon, he should have been careful with it?</p>

<p class="bas indent1"><span class="nm">(c)</span>This question is unresolved.</p>
<p class="bas subject"><span class="nm">3)</span>EVALUATION OF THE DAMAGE</p>
<p class="bas indent1"><span class="nm">(a)</span><span class="cl">(Mishnah):</span> We evaluate the damage (by evaluating a Beis Se'ah...)</p>
<p class="bas indent1"><span class="nm">(b)</span><span class="cl">Question:</span> What is the source of this?</p>
<p class="bas indent1"><span class="nm">(c)</span><span class="cl">Answer (Rav Masnah):</span> "It will consume in a different field" - we evaluate the damage based on another field.</p>
<p class="bas indent1"><span class="nm">(d)</span><span class="cl">Question:</span> We need that verse to exempt (Shen) in a Reshus ha'Rabim!</p>
<p class="bas indent1"><span class="nm">(e)</span><span class="cl">Answer:</span> If it only came to teach that, it should say 'his friend's field' or 'a different field';</p>
<p class="bas indent2"><span class="nm">1.</span>Rather, it says "in a different field" to teach that we evaluate the damage as if it were in another field.</p>
<p class="bas indent1"><span class="nm">(f)</span><span class="cl">Question:</span> Perhaps the verse only comes to teach that!</p>
<p class="bas indent1"><span class="nm">(g)</span><span class="cl">Answer:</span> If so, it should have been written regarding the payments, 'from the best of his field and vineyard he will pay in another field';</p>
<p class="bas indent2"><span class="nm">1.</span>The Torah wrote it regarding the damage, so we learn both.</p>
<p class="bas indent1"><span class="nm">(h)</span><span class="cl">Question:</span> How do we evaluate?</p>
<p class="bas indent1"><span class="nm">(i)</span><span class="cl">Answer #1 (R. Yosi bar Chanina):</span> (We consider how much the damaged area would decrease the value of) a Beis Se'ah sold amidst a field of 60 Beis Se'ah. (Larger fields are proportionally cheaper, for only rich people can buy them.)</p>
<p class="bas indent1"><span class="nm">(j)</span><span class="cl">Answer #2 (R. Yanai):</span> We consider a half-Beis Se'ah amidst (a field) 60 times as big. (Meiri, Maharam Shif - we consider how much the damaged area would decrease the value of a Beis Se'ah sold amidst a field of 30 Beis Se'ah.)</p>
<p class="bas indent1"><span class="nm">(k)</span><span class="cl">Answer #3 (Chizkiyah):</span> We evaluate (the decreased value due to) the amount eaten among 60 times as much.</p>
<p class="bas indent1"><span class="nm">(l)</span><span class="cl">Question (Beraisa):</span> If it ate one or two Kavim, we evaluate amidst (among) a small patch.</p>
<p class="bas indent2"><span class="nm">1.</span><span class="cl">Suggestion:</span> We evaluate the small patch by itself.</p>
<p class="bas indent1"><span class="nm">(m)</span><span class="cl">Answer:</span> No, we evaluate it amidst 60 times as much (each Amora according to his opinion).</p>
<p class="bas indent1"><span class="nm">(n)</span><span class="cl">(Beraisa):</span> We do not estimate the value of one Kav, for this makes it better. We do not estimate the value of a Beis Kor (one Kor is 30 Se'ah), for this makes it worse.</p>
<p class="bas indent1"><span class="nm">(o)</span><span class="cl">Question:</span> What does this mean?</p>
<p class="bas indent1"><span class="nm">(p)</span><span class="cl">Answer #1 (Rav Papa):</span> We do not estimate the value of one Kav (eaten) among 60 Kavim, for this favors the damager. We do not estimate the value of one Kor (eaten) among 60 times as much, for this harms the damager. (Rather, we estimate one Se'ah in 60.)</p>
<p class="bas indent1"><span class="nm">(q)</span><span class="cl">Objection (Rav Huna bar Mano'ach):</span> If so, it should not say 'a Beis Kor', rather 'a Kor' (since that was eaten)!</p>
<p class="bas indent1"><span class="nm">(r)</span><span class="cl">Answer #2 (Rav Huna bar Mano'ach):</span> We do not estimate the value of one Kav (eaten) alone, for this favors the victim; nor do we estimate it among a Beis Kor, for this hurts the victim;</p>
<p class="bas indent2"><span class="nm">1.</span>Rather, we evaluate it among 60 times as much.</p>
<p class="bas subject"><span class="nm">4)</span>EVALUATING DAMAGES DUE TO PEOPLE</p>
<p class="bas indent1"><span class="nm">(a)</span>A case occurred in which Reuven cut down Shimon's date tree.</p>
<p class="bas indent2"><span class="nm">1.</span><span class="cl">Reish Galusa (the Exilarch) :</span> I saw that there were three trees together there, and they were worth 100 in all. Reuven must pay one third of this.</p>
<p class="bas indent2"><span class="nm">2.</span><span class="cl">Reuven:</span> That is like Persians rule! I will go to Rav Nachman.</p>
<p class="bas indent2"><span class="nm">3.</span><span class="cl">Rav Nachman:</span> We evaluate among 60 times as much.</p>
<p class="bas indent2"><span class="nm">4.</span><span class="cl">Rava:</span> We said so when a man's property damages. Does it apply when a man himself damages?</p>
<p class="bas indent1"><span class="nm">(b)</span><span class="cl">Suggestion (Abaye, to Rava):</span> Perhaps you learn a man's damage from the following Beraisa?</p>
<p class="bas indent2"><span class="nm">1.</span><span class="cl">(Beraisa):</span> If Levi ruined Yehudah's vineyard when the grapes were unripe, we see how much it was worth before, and how much it is worth now.</p>
<p class="bas indent2"><span class="nm">2.</span>The Beraisa does not mention 60.</p>
<p class="bas indent1"><span class="nm">(c)</span><span class="cl">Rejection (Abaye):</span> That is no proof. A similar Beraisa discusses damage of an animal (and does not mention 60)!</p>
<p class="bas indent2"><span class="nm">1.</span><span class="cl">(Beraisa - R. Yosi):</span> If (one's animal) cut the top off a young tree, those who make decrees in Yerushalayim decreed to pay two (silver coins) for a first year tree, and four for a second year tree.</p>
<p class="bas indent2"><span class="nm">2.</span>R. Yosi ha'Glili says, if it ate fodder, we evaluate the remnant, what it is worth at harvest time;</p>
<p class="bas indent2"><span class="nm">3.</span>Chachamim say, we see how much it was worth before, and how much it is worth now.</p>
<p class="bas indent2"><span class="nm">4.</span>R. Yehoshua says, if it ate Semadar (immature grapes right after budding), we view them as if they were ready to be harvested;</p>
<p class="bas indent2"><span class="nm">5.</span>Chachamim say, we see how much it was worth before, and how much it is worth now.</p>
<p class="bas indent2"><span class="nm">6.</span>R. Shimon ben Yehudah says, this is only when it ate grapes or figs that were just budding. If it ate Pagim or Boser (proper grapes or figs that are not fully grown), we view them as if they were ready to be harvested.</p>
<p class="bas indent2"><span class="nm">7.</span><span class="cl">Summation of Rejection:</span> Chachamim say that we see how much it was worth before, and how much it is worth now. They did not mention 60, but we know that this is the law;</p>
<p class="bas indent3"><span class="nm">i.</span>The same applies to the Beraisa about a man who damaged!</p>
