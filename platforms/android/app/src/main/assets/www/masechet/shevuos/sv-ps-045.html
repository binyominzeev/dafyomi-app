<p class="dedicationbox">SHEVUOS 45 - Two weeks of study material have been dedicated by Mrs. Estanne Abraham Fawer to honor the Yahrzeit of her father, Rav Mordechai ben Eliezer Zvi (Rabbi Morton Weiner) Z'L, who passed away on 18 Teves 5760. May the merit of supporting and advancing Dafyomi study -- which was so important to him -- during the weeks of his Yahrzeit serve as an Iluy for his Neshamah. </p>

<p class="bas subject"><span class="nm">1)</span>OATHS TAKEN TO RECEIVE PAYMENT (cont.)</p>
<p class="bas indent1"><span class="nm">(a)</span>If one claims from a defendant who is disqualified from swearing, he swears and collects. One is disqualified if he ever swore falsely Shevu'as ha'Edus or Shevu'as ha'Pikadon, or even if he once swore in vain;</p>
<p class="bas indent2"><span class="nm">1.</span>If one of them plays dice (gambles), lends on usury, is Mafriach (races or sends) birds, or does business with Shemitah Peros, the other swears and collects;</p>
<p class="bas indent1"><span class="nm">(b)</span>R. Yosi says, if both are disqualified, the Shevu'ah returns to its source (this will be explained later);</p>
<p class="bas indent1"><span class="nm">(c)</span>R. Meir says, they divide the disputed money.</p>
<p class="bas indent1"><span class="nm">(d)</span>A grocer swearing about his ledger does <i>not</i> mean that he says 'my ledger says that Levi owes me 200 Zuz';</p>
<p class="bas indent2"><span class="nm">1.</span>Rather, Levi told Yehudah 'give two Sa'im of wheat to my son, or a Sela to my workers', and Yehudah claims that he gave, and the workers say that they did not receive;</p>
<p class="bas indent2"><span class="nm">2.</span>Yehudah swears that he gave, the workers swear that they did not receive, and Levi pays everyone.</p>
<p class="bas indent1"><span class="nm">(e)</span>Ben Nanas says, we cannot allow both parties to swear, for one side is lying!</p>
<p class="bas indent2"><span class="nm">1.</span>Rather, no one (Ran's text - only Yehudah) swears, and Levi pays everyone.</p>
<p class="bas indent1"><span class="nm">(f)</span>Reuven asked Shimon (a grocer) for a Dinar's worth of Peros. Shimon gave to him, and asked for the money.</p>
<p class="bas indent2"><span class="nm">1.</span><span class="cl">Reuven:</span> I already gave to you. You put it in your pouch!</p>
<p class="bas indent2"><span class="nm">2.</span>Reuven swears that he gave to him, and keeps the Peros.</p>
<p class="bas indent1"><span class="nm">(g)</span>Reuven asked Shimon for Peros for which he already gave a Dinar.</p>
<p class="bas indent2"><span class="nm">1.</span><span class="cl">Shimon:</span> I already gave to you, and you took them home!</p>
<p class="bas indent2"><span class="nm">2.</span>Shimon swears that he gave to him, and he is exempt.</p>
<p class="bas indent1"><span class="nm">(h)</span>R. Yehudah says, whoever holds the Peros has the upper hand (i.e. in the prior case, Reuven need not swear).</p>
<p class="bas indent1"><span class="nm">(i)</span>Reuven asked Shimon (a moneychanger) for a Dinar's worth of smaller coins. Shimon gave to him, and asked for the Dinar.</p>
<p class="bas indent2"><span class="nm">1.</span><span class="cl">Reuven:</span> I already gave to you, and you put it in your pouch!</p>
<p class="bas indent2"><span class="nm">2.</span>Reuven swears that he gave to him, and keeps the coins.</p>
<p class="bas indent1"><span class="nm">(j)</span>Reuven asked Shimon for the smaller coins for which he already gave a Dinar.</p>
<p class="bas indent2"><span class="nm">1.</span><span class="cl">Shimon:</span> I already gave to you, and you put it in your wallet!</p>
<p class="bas indent2"><span class="nm">2.</span>Shimon swears that he gave to him and is exempt.</p>
<p class="bas indent1"><span class="nm">(k)</span>R. Yehudah says, a moneychanger does not give coins before he receives his money.</p>
<p class="bas indent1"><span class="nm">(l)</span>We already learned (in other Mishnayos) that the following people must swear in order to collect - a woman who already received part of her Kesuvah, and wants to collect the rest; one who presents a loan document and asks to be paid, and one witness testifies that it was paid; one who wants to collect from property that the borrowed sold, or property of orphans; a woman who wants to collect her Kesuvah in the absence of her ex-husband;</p>
<p class="bas indent2"><span class="nm">1.</span>Similarly, orphans must swear to collect (from other orphans) 'our father did not tell us that this document was paid, nor did we find a receipt saying that the document was paid';</p>
<p class="bas indent1"><span class="nm">(m)</span>R. Yochanan ben Brokah says, even if the son was born after the father died, he swears (that he did not find a receipt) and collects;</p>
<p class="bas indent1"><span class="nm">(n)</span>R. Shimon ben Gamliel says, if witnesses testify that just before the father died, he said that the document was not paid, the orphans collect without swearing.</p>
<p class="bas indent1"><span class="nm">(o)</span>The following people are required to swear (to the people they work for or with), even when there is no (definite) claim against them - a partner, a sharecropper, an overseer, and a woman or member of the household who conducts business in the house;</p>
<p class="bas indent2"><span class="nm">1.</span>The partner (or landowner or orphans or husband) can request an oath without a specific claim;</p>
<p class="bas indent2"><span class="nm">2.</span>After the partners split up (or the others cease from their positions), they need not swear (if there is no definite claim);</p>
<p class="bas indent3"><span class="nm">i.</span>If the former partner (or sharecropper... ) must swear about something else, he can be forced to swear about the partnership through Gilgul.</p>
<p class="bas indent1"><span class="nm">(p)</span>Shemitah cancels the obligation to swear (about a claim of money owed from before Shemitah).</p>
<p class="bas indent1"><span class="nm">(q)</span><span class="cl">(Gemara) Question:</span> What is the source that when one must swear mid'Oraisa, it is to avoid paying?</p>
<p class="bas indent1"><span class="nm">(r)</span><span class="cl">Answer:</span> "V'Lakach Be'alav v'Lo Yeshalem" - the one who was asked to pay, he swears instead.</p>
<p class="bas subject"><span class="nm">2)</span>THE OATH OF A WORKER</p>
<p class="bas indent1"><span class="nm">(a)</span><span class="cl">(Mishnah):</span> The following take a rabbinical oath and collect...</p>
<p class="bas indent1"><span class="nm">(b)</span><span class="cl">Question:</span> Why did Chachamim enact that a worker swears and collects?</p>
<p class="bas indent1"><span class="nm">(c)</span><span class="cl">Answer #1 (Rav Yehudah citing Shmuel):</span> Great Halachos (this connotes a tradition from Moshe from Sinai) were taught here!</p>
<p class="bas indent1"><span class="nm">(d)</span><span class="cl">Objection:</span> This is not a tradition from Sinai!</p>
<p class="bas indent1"><span class="nm">(e)</span><span class="cl">Answer #2 (Rav Nachman citing Shmuel):</span> Rather, great <i>enactments</i> were taught here;</p>
<p class="bas indent2"><span class="nm">1.</span>Really, the oath should have been imposed on the employer (to swear and be exempt);</p>
<p class="bas indent2"><span class="nm">2.</span>Chachamim enacted that the worker swears and collects for the sake of his livelihood.</p>
<p class="bas indent2"><span class="nm">3.</span><span class="cl">Question:</span> Is that a proper reason to take money from the employer?!</p>
<p class="bas indent2"><span class="nm">4.</span><span class="cl">Answer:</span> The enactment benefits the employer. It encourages people to work for others.</p>
<p class="bas indent3"><span class="nm">i.</span><span class="cl">Question:</span> The worker would prefer that the employer swears and is exempt, to encourage him to hire workers!</p>
<p class="bas indent3"><span class="nm">ii.</span><span class="cl">Answer:</span> No. An employer must hire people in any case.</p>
<p class="bas indent2"><span class="nm">5.</span><span class="cl">Objection:</span> Also workers must work for others in any case!</p>
<p class="bas indent1"><span class="nm">(f)</span><span class="cl">Answer #3:</span> Rather, an employer is busy overseeing his workers, so presumably he forgot that he did not pay.</p>
<p class="bas indent1"><span class="nm">(g)</span><span class="cl">Question #1:</span> If so, the worker should collect without swearing!</p>
<p class="bas indent1"><span class="nm">(h)</span><span class="cl">Answer:</span> The oath is to appease the employer (so he will not suspect that the worker is lying).</p>
<p class="bas indent2"><span class="nm">1.</span><span class="cl">Question:</span> Chachamim should have enacted that he must pay the worker in front of witnesses!</p>
<p class="bas indent2"><span class="nm">2.</span><span class="cl">Answer:</span> That is too tedious.</p>
<p class="bas indent2"><span class="nm">3.</span><span class="cl">Question:</span> Chachamim should have enacted that workers are paid before they work (so they will not be believed later).</p>
<p class="bas indent2"><span class="nm">4.</span><span class="cl">Answer:</span> Everyone prefers that workers are paid after working. (Sometimes the employer does not have money to pay them beforehand. The workers fear lest they spend the money.)</p>
<p class="bas bbbline">45b----------------------------------------45b</p>
<p class="bas indent1"><span class="nm">(i)</span><span class="cl">Question #2:</span> If so (the enactment is because an employer is busy), the same should apply even if they argue about the (amount of the) wages!</p>
<p class="bas indent2"><span class="nm">1.</span><span class="cl">(Beraisa):</span> If the worker says 'you hired me for two', and the employer says 'I hired you for one', (for the worker) to take money from another (the employer), he must bring proof.</p>
<p class="bas indent1"><span class="nm">(j)</span><span class="cl">Answer:</span> People (even the employer) surely remember the agreed wages.</p>
<p class="bas indent1"><span class="nm">(k)</span><span class="cl">Question #3:</span> The enactment should apply even after the time to be paid!</p>
<p class="bas indent2"><span class="nm">1.</span><span class="cl">(Mishnah):</span> After the deadline by which he must be paid (e.g. for one who works during the day, it is the next morning), he does not swear and collect.</p>
<p class="bas indent1"><span class="nm">(l)</span><span class="cl">Answer:</span> There is a Chazakah that an employer will not transgress "Lo Salin" (keeping a worker's wages overnight).</p>
<p class="bas indent1"><span class="nm">(m)</span><span class="cl">Question:</span> We said that an employer is busy, he forgets!</p>
<p class="bas indent1"><span class="nm">(n)</span><span class="cl">Answer:</span> That is before the deadline comes. When it comes, he motivates himself and remembers.</p>
<p class="bas indent1"><span class="nm">(o)</span><span class="cl">Question:</span> Do we suspect that a worker (who claims payment after the due time) is trying to steal?</p>
<p class="bas indent1"><span class="nm">(p)</span><span class="cl">Answer:</span> Two Chazakos support the employer, but only one supports the worker.</p>
<p class="bas indent2"><span class="nm">1.</span>There is a Chazakah that an employer will not transgress "Lo Salin", and that a worker does not delay claiming his wages;</p>
<p class="bas indent2"><span class="nm">2.</span>The only Chazakah supporting the worker is that we do not suspect him of stealing.</p>
<p class="bas subject"><span class="nm">3)</span>A WORKER WHO CANNOT PROVE THAT HE WAS HIRED</p>
<p class="bas indent1"><span class="nm">(a)</span><span class="cl">(Shmuel):</span> A worker swears and collects only if witnesses know that he was hired. If not, the employer is believed, Migo he could say that he never hired him.</p>
<p class="bas indent1"><span class="nm">(b)</span><span class="cl">R. Yitzchak:</span> Correct! Also R. Yochanan taught this way.</p>
<p class="bas indent1"><span class="nm">(c)</span><span class="cl">Inference:</span> Reish Lakish (who often argues with R. Yochanan) disagrees!</p>
<p class="bas indent1"><span class="nm">(d)</span><span class="cl">Rejection:</span> This cannot be inferred, for R. Yitzchak left before Reish Lakish had a chance to argue.</p>
<p class="bas indent2"><span class="nm">1.</span><span class="cl">Version #1:</span> Reish Lakish was drinking when R. Yochanan said this law.</p>
<p class="bas indent2"><span class="nm">2.</span><span class="cl">Version #2:</span> Reish Lakish never disagrees with R. Yochanan until R. Yochanan finishes speaking.</p>
<p class="bas indent1"><span class="nm">(e)</span>Also Rav taught like Shmuel.</p>
<p class="bas indent1"><span class="nm">(f)</span><span class="cl">(Rami bar Chama):</span> This is a great teaching!</p>
<p class="bas indent1"><span class="nm">(g)</span><span class="cl">Objection (Rava):</span> No. If such a Migo exempts from swearing, when did the Torah obligate Shomrim to swear?!</p>
<p class="bas indent2"><span class="nm">1.</span>Since a Shomer is believed (without swearing) to say that he never received the deposit, he is believed to say that it was lost through Ones!</p>
<p class="bas indent1"><span class="nm">(h)</span><span class="cl">Answer #1 (Rami bar Chama):</span> The case is, witnesses saw the Shomer receive the deposit.</p>
<p class="bas indent1"><span class="nm">(i)</span><span class="cl">Objection (Rava):</span> Migo that the Shomer is believed (without swearing) to say that he returned the deposit, he is believed to say that it was lost through Ones!</p>
<p class="bas indent1"><span class="nm">(j)</span><span class="cl">Answer #2 (Rami bar Chama):</span> The case is, the depositor has a document that the Shomer received the deposit. (Therefore, the Shomer would not be believed to say that he returned the deposit. He has no Migo).</p>
<p class="bas indent1"><span class="nm">(k)</span><span class="cl">Inference:</span> Rami bar Chama and Rava both agree that if witnesses saw a Shomer receive a deposit, the Shomer is believed to say that he returned it without witnesses;</p>
<p class="bas indent2"><span class="nm">1.</span>If a document was written that the Shomer received the deposit, he must return it with witnesses (or take back the document).</p>
<p class="bas indent1"><span class="nm">(l)</span><span class="cl">Question (Rav Sheshes of Rabah bar Shmuel):</span> Does the Halachah follow Shmuel?</p>
<p class="bas indent1"><span class="nm">(m)</span><span class="cl">Answer: (Rabah bar Shmuel - Beraisa):</span> If a worker claims (on the day he worked) that he was not paid, he swears and collects;</p>
<p class="bas indent2"><span class="nm">1.</span>This is only if the employer agrees that he hired him, and they argue about whether he was paid;</p>
<p class="bas indent2"><span class="nm">2.</span>If a worker claims that he was hired for two (Zuz), and the employer says that he hired him for one, (for the worker) to take money (from the employer), he must bring proof.</p>
<p class="bas indent3"><span class="nm">i.</span>Since the Seifa discusses bringing a proof (i.e. witnesses who saw when he was hired), the Reisha is without witnesses (and the worker swears and collects. This refutes Shmuel).</p>
<p class="bas indent1"><span class="nm">(n)</span><span class="cl">Rejection (Rav Nachman bar Yitzchak):</span> No, in both clauses there are witnesses;</p>
<p class="bas indent2"><span class="nm">1.</span>The Seifa mentions them because they suffice to collect, i.e. the worker need not swear;</p>
<p class="bas indent2"><span class="nm">2.</span>The Reisha omits them because they are not sufficient. Also, the worker must swear.</p>
