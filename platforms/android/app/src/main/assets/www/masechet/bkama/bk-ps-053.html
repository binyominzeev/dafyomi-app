<p class="bas subject"><span class="nm">1)</span>FALLING INTO A PIT DUE TO NOISE</p>
<p class="bas indent1"><span class="nm">(a)</span><span class="cl">(Mishnah):</span> If an animal fell forwards...</p>
<p class="bas indent1"><span class="nm">(b)</span><span class="cl">(Rav):</span> 'Forwards' and 'backwards' are understood simply. In both cases, it fell in the pit.</p>
<p class="bas indent2"><span class="nm">1.</span>This is like Rav holds, that one is liable for the Hevel at the bottom of a pit (i.e. when it falls headfirst), not for the blow. (When it falls backwards, the only damage is from the blow.)</p>
<p class="bas indent1"><span class="nm">(c)</span><span class="cl">(Shmuel):</span> If it falls in the pit, either way it is liable;</p>
<p class="bas indent2"><span class="nm">1.</span>This is like Shmuel holds, that one is liable for the Hevel, and all the more so for the blow.</p>
<p class="bas indent2"><span class="nm">2.</span>The Mishnah exempts for falling backwards from the noise of the digging. This is when it tripped on the pit and fell outside the pit.</p>
<p class="bas indent1"><span class="nm">(d)</span><span class="cl">Question (against Rav - Beraisa):</span> If it falls in the pit, whether forwards or backward, it is liable.</p>
<p class="bas indent1"><span class="nm">(e)</span><span class="cl">Answer #1 (Rav Chisda):</span> Rav agrees about a pit in the owner's premises (since he owns the ground, he is liable also for the blow).</p>
<p class="bas indent1"><span class="nm">(f)</span><span class="cl">Answer #2 (Rabah):</span> In the Beraisa, 'backwards' is when it fell headfirst, then flipped over onto its back.</p>
<p class="bas indent2"><span class="nm">1.</span>We attribute the death to the Hevel at the bottom, which it inhaled at the beginning of the fall.</p>
<p class="bas indent1"><span class="nm">(g)</span><span class="cl">Answer #3 (Rav Yosef):</span> The Beraisa discusses liability of (the owner of) the ox for damage to the pit.</p>
<p class="bas indent1"><span class="nm">(h)</span><span class="cl">Question:</span> What was the damage?</p>
<p class="bas indent1"><span class="nm">(i)</span><span class="cl">Answer:</span> It dirtied the water.</p>
<p class="bas indent2"><span class="nm">1.</span>The Beraisa teaches that he is liable either way the ox fell.</p>
<p class="bas indent1"><span class="nm">(j)</span><span class="cl">Support (for Rav - Rav Chananya - Beraisa):</span> "And it fell" - he is liable only if it fell normally;</p>
<p class="bas indent2"><span class="nm">1.</span>If an animal fell forwards, from the noise of the digging, he is liable;</p>
<p class="bas indent2"><span class="nm">2.</span>If it fell backwards, from the noise of the digging, he is exempt;</p>
<p class="bas indent2"><span class="nm">3.</span>In both cases, it fell in the pit.</p>
<p class="bas indent1"><span class="nm">(k)</span><span class="cl">Question:</span> Why is the pit's owner liable if fell in forwards, from the noise of the digging? The one digging caused the damage! (The digger is exempt because it is only Gerama.)</p>
<p class="bas indent1"><span class="nm">(l)</span><span class="cl">Answer (Rav Simi bar Ashi):</span> The Beraisa is like R. Nasan, who says that since the pit damaged, what cannot be collected from the other damager is collected from the pit.</p>
<p class="bas subject"><span class="nm">2)</span>DAMAGE CAUSED BY TWO RARTIES</p>
<p class="bas indent1"><span class="nm">(a)</span><span class="cl">(Beraisa):</span> If Reuven's ox pushed Shimon's ox into Levi's pit, Reuven is liable, and Levi is exempt;</p>
<p class="bas indent1"><span class="nm">(b)</span>R. Nasan says, Reuven and Levi each pay half.</p>
<p class="bas indent1"><span class="nm">(c)</span><span class="cl">Contradiction (Beraisa - R. Nasan):</span> Reuven pays quarter-damage, and Levi pays three fourths.</p>
<p class="bas indent1"><span class="nm">(d)</span><span class="cl">Answer:</span> A Mu'ad pays half the damage. A Tam pays quarter-damage.</p>
<p class="bas indent1"><span class="nm">(e)</span><span class="cl">Question:</span> What is the reason?</p>
<p class="bas indent2"><span class="nm">1.</span>If R. Nasan holds that the ox and pit both did all the damage, even a Tam should pay half!</p>
<p class="bas indent2"><span class="nm">2.</span>If he holds that each did half the damage, a Tam should pay a fourth, the pit should pay a half, and Shimon should lose a fourth!</p>
<p class="bas indent1"><span class="nm">(f)</span><span class="cl">Answer #1 (Rava):</span> Really, each did all the damage;</p>
<p class="bas indent2"><span class="nm">1.</span>When a Tam damages alone, it pays half-damage. Here since it had a partner, it only pays half of that.</p>
<p class="bas indent1"><span class="nm">(g)</span><span class="cl">Answer #2:</span> Really, each did half the damage;</p>
<p class="bas indent2"><span class="nm">1.</span>Shimon can tell Levi 'my ox died in your pit. What I cannot collect from Reuven, I can collect from you.'</p>
<p class="bas indent1"><span class="nm">(h)</span><span class="cl">(Rava):</span> If Reuven put a rock on the mouth of Levi's pit; and Shimon's ox tripped on it and fell in the pit, R. Nasan and Chachamim argue about this.</p>
<p class="bas indent1"><span class="nm">(i)</span><span class="cl">Question:</span> This is obvious!</p>
<p class="bas indent1"><span class="nm">(j)</span><span class="cl">Answer:</span> One might have thought that Chachamim exempt Levi only when Reuven's ox pushed the ox in. Even if not for the pit, Reuven's ox would have killed it;</p>
<p class="bas indent2"><span class="nm">1.</span>Here, if not for the pit, the rock would not have damaged, so they would agree that Levi pays half the damage! Rava teaches that this is not so, for if not for the rock, the pit would not have damaged.</p>
<p class="bas bbbline">53b----------------------------------------53b</p>
<p class="bas indent1"><span class="nm">(k)</span><span class="cl">Version #1 (Abaye):</span> If Reuven's ox and a blemished Korban gored together, Reuven pays half-damage;</p>
<p class="bas indent1"><span class="nm">(l)</span><span class="cl">(Ravina):</span> He pays quarter-damage.</p>
<p class="bas indent1"><span class="nm">(m)</span><span class="cl">Resolution #1:</span> Both of them discuss a Tam. Abaye's law is like R. Nasan, and Ravina's is like Chachamim.</p>
<p class="bas indent1"><span class="nm">(n)</span><span class="cl">Resolution #2:</span> Both are like Chachamim. Abaye discusses a Mu'ad, and Ravina discusses a Tam.</p>
<p class="bas indent1"><span class="nm">(o)</span><span class="cl">Version #2 (Abaye):</span> Reuven pays half-damage;</p>

<p class="bas subject"><span class="nm">3)</span>DAMAGE OF A MAN, AN OX AND A PIT TOGETHER</p>
<p class="bas indent1"><span class="nm">(a)</span><span class="cl">(Rava):</span> Reuven's ox and Shimon pushed (something) into Levi's pit:</p>
<p class="bas indent2"><span class="nm">1.</span>Regarding Nezek (damage to a person), all are liable;</p>
<p class="bas indent3"><span class="nm">i.</span>Regarding the other four damages (pain,...) and payment for an aborted fetus, only Shimon is liable;</p>
<p class="bas indent2"><span class="nm">2.</span>Regarding Kofer and the 30 Shekalim for killing a slave, only Reuven is liable;</p>
<p class="bas indent2"><span class="nm">3.</span>Regarding damage to Kelim and a blemished Korban (that was redeemed), Reuven and Shimon are liable, and Levi is exempt.</p>
<p class="bas indent1"><span class="nm">(b)</span><span class="cl">Question:</span> Why is Levi exempt (for a blemished Korban)?</p>
<p class="bas indent1"><span class="nm">(c)</span><span class="cl">Answer:</span> "And the carcass (of an ox that fell in a pit) will be to him (the ox's owner)" - the carcass of a blemished Korban is forbidden.</p>
<p class="bas indent1"><span class="nm">(d)</span><span class="cl">Question:</span> Rava was unsure of this!</p>
<p class="bas indent2"><span class="nm">1.</span><span class="cl">Question (Rava):</span> If a blemished Korban fell into a pit, what is the law?</p>
<p class="bas indent3"><span class="nm">i.</span>We cannot apply "and the carcass will be to him" (because the carcass is forbidden), so the owner of the pit is exempt);</p>
<p class="bas indent3"><span class="nm">ii.</span>Or, does the verse teach that the ox's owner deals with the carcass (he is paid only the difference between the value of a live animal and the carcass)?</p>
<p class="bas indent1"><span class="nm">(e)</span><span class="cl">Answer:</span> Rava later concluded like the first side of his question.</p>
<p class="bas indent1"><span class="nm">(f)</span><span class="cl">Question:</span> How does Rava learn that the ox's owner deals with the carcass?</p>
<p class="bas indent1"><span class="nm">(g)</span><span class="cl">Answer:</span> He learns from "the carcass will be to him" in the Parshah of an ox that gores.</p>
<p class="bas indent1"><span class="nm">(h)</span><span class="cl">Question:</span> Regarding a pit, Rava uses this phrase to exclude a blemished Korban; regarding an ox, he learns that the victim's owner deals with the carcass;</p>
<p class="bas indent2"><span class="nm">1.</span>Perhaps regarding a pit it teaches that the victim's owner deals with the carcass, and regarding a goring ox, it excludes a blemished Korban!</p>
<p class="bas indent1"><span class="nm">(i)</span><span class="cl">Answer:</span> It is more reasonable to exempt a pit (for a blemished Korban), since a pit is exempt for Kelim.</p>
<p class="bas indent1"><span class="nm">(j)</span><span class="cl">Question:</span> Just the opposite! A (Tam) ox is more lenient, for it pays only half-damage!</p>
<p class="bas indent1"><span class="nm">(k)</span><span class="cl">Answer:</span> We never find that Keren is totally exempt.</p>
<p class="bas subject"><span class="nm">4)</span>DOES ONE PAY FOR <i>KELIM</i> DAMAGED IN A PIT?</p>
<p class="bas indent1"><span class="nm">(a)</span><span class="cl">(Mishnah):</span> If an ox and its Kelim fell and they broke...</p>
<p class="bas indent1"><span class="nm">(b)</span>Our Mishnah is unlike R. Yehudah:</p>
<p class="bas indent2"><span class="nm">1.</span><span class="cl">(Beraisa - R. Yehudah):</span> The owner of a pit is liable for Kelim.</p>
<p class="bas indent1"><span class="nm">(c)</span><span class="cl">Question:</span> Why do Chachamim exempt him?</p>
<p class="bas indent1"><span class="nm">(d)</span><span class="cl">Answer:</span> One pays if "an ox or a donkey fell in" - "an ox", but not a person; "a donkey", but not Kelim.</p>
<p class="bas indent2"><span class="nm">1.</span>R. Yehudah explains, "or" includes Kelim.</p>
<p class="bas indent2"><span class="nm">2.</span>Chachamim need "or" to teach that one is liable even when only one animal falls in.</p>
<p class="bas indent2"><span class="nm">3.</span>R. Yehudah learns this from the singular conjugation "v'Nafal (and it will fall)".</p>
<p class="bas indent2"><span class="nm">4.</span>Chachamim hold that "v'Nafal" also connotes animals falling.</p>
