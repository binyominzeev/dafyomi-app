<p class="bas subject"><span class="nm">1)</span>FORBIDDEN OILS</p>
<p class="bas indent1"><span class="nm">(a)</span><span class="cl">(Mishnah):</span> We may not use pitch.</p>
<p class="bas indent1"><span class="nm">(b)</span><span class="cl">(Beraisa):</span> Before pitch the Mishnah lists Pasul wicks, afterwards Pasul oils are listed.</p>
<p class="bas indent1"><span class="nm">(c)</span><span class="cl">Objection:</span> This is obvious!</p>
<p class="bas indent1"><span class="nm">(d)</span><span class="cl">Version #1 (Rashi) Answer:</span> Wax was not obvious - one might have thought that it is Pasul even if it is [like] a wick (surrounds a wick, like our candles) - the Beraisa teaches, it is Pasul only when used like oil.</p>
<p class="bas indent1"><span class="nm">(e)</span>Version #2 (Chachamim of Narvona, cited by Tosfos) Answer: Wax was not obvious - one might have thought that it is Pasul even for a wick - the Beraisa teaches, it is Pasul only for oil. (end of Version #2)</p>
<p class="bas indent1"><span class="nm">(f)</span><span class="cl">(Rami bar Avin):</span> Itran (tar, mentioned in the next Mishnah) is the waste of pitch (when pitch is heated, tar exudes); wax is the waste of [cakes of] honey.</p>
<p class="bas indent1"><span class="nm">(g)</span><span class="cl">Question:</span> What difference does it make?</p>
<p class="bas indent1"><span class="nm">(h)</span><span class="cl">Answer:</span> This is relevant to commerce (if one sold tar or wax, this is what he must give).</p>
<p class="bas indent1"><span class="nm">(i)</span><span class="cl">(Beraisa):</span> The oils that may not be left burning in a lamp over Shabbos may be used for a big fire, for heat or for light;</p>
<p class="bas indent2"><span class="nm">1.</span>This is permitted whether it is on the ground or in a lamp.</p>
<p class="bas indent2"><span class="nm">2.</span>They are forbidden only to be put in a lamp with a wick.</p>
<p class="bas indent1"><span class="nm">(j)</span><span class="cl">(Mishnah):</span> Kik oil.</p>
<p class="bas indent1"><span class="nm">(k)</span><span class="cl">Question:</span> What is this?</p>
<p class="bas indent1"><span class="nm">(l)</span><span class="cl">(Shmuel):</span> Seafarers told me that there is a bird overseas called Kik.</p>
<p class="bas indent1"><span class="nm">(m)</span><span class="cl">Answer #2 (Rav Yitzchak brei d'Rav Yehudah):</span> It is cottonseed oil.</p>
<p class="bas indent1"><span class="nm">(n)</span><span class="cl">Answer #3 (Reish Lakish):</span> It comes from a Kikayon (the tree Hash-m made grow for Yonah).</p>
<p class="bas indent1"><span class="nm">(o)</span><span class="cl">(Rabah bar bar Chanah):</span> I saw the Kikayon of Yonah - it was like the plant from which yields castor oil; it grows in swamps, storekeepers hang it over the openings of their shops for shade and a good smell;</p>
<p class="bas indent2"><span class="nm">1.</span>Oil is made from its seeds, in Eretz Yisrael, all sick people rest in the shade of its branches.</p>
<p class="bas subject"><span class="nm">2)</span>FIXING BAD OILS</p>
<p class="bas indent1"><span class="nm">(a)</span><span class="cl">(Rabah):</span> Chachamim forbade the wicks [in our Mishnah] because they flicker; they forbade the oils because they are not drawn up the wick.</p>
<p class="bas indent1"><span class="nm">(b)</span><span class="cl">Question (Abaye):</span> May one put a drop of [good] oil into a Pasul oil and light with them?</p>
<p class="bas indent2"><span class="nm">1.</span>(It will cause the oil to be drawn up the wick - but) do we decree lest one use the Pasul oil by itself, or not?</p>
<p class="bas indent1"><span class="nm">(c)</span><span class="cl">Answer (Rabah):</span> We may not light with it.</p>
<p class="bas indent1"><span class="nm">(d)</span><span class="cl">Question:</span> What is the reason?</p>
<p class="bas indent1"><span class="nm">(e)</span><span class="cl">Answer (Rabah):</span> This is because we may not light with it (it is a decree).</p>
<p class="bas indent1"><span class="nm">(f)</span><span class="cl">Question (Abaye - Beraisa):</span> If one wound a good wick around something we may not light with, one may not light with it;</p>
<p class="bas indent2"><span class="nm">1.</span>R. Shimon ben Gamliel says, in my father's house they would wind a wick around a nut and light with it.</p>
<p class="bas indent2"><span class="nm">2.</span><span class="cl">Rabah:</span> Why do you ask from R. Shimon, the first Tana supports me!</p>
<p class="bas indent2"><span class="nm">3.</span><span class="cl">Abaye:</span> We rely on R. Shimon' opinion, for it was followed in practice.</p>
<p class="bas indent2"><span class="nm">4.</span><span class="cl">Summation of question - suggestion:</span> They would light the wick and the nut!</p>
<p class="bas indent1"><span class="nm">(g)</span><span class="cl">Answer:</span> No, the nut was merely to make the wick float [above the oil].</p>
<p class="bas indent1"><span class="nm">(h)</span><span class="cl">Question:</span> Why does the first Tana forbid?</p>
<p class="bas indent1"><span class="nm">(i)</span><span class="cl">Answer:</span> The entire Beraisa is R. Shimon, it is abbreviated, it means as follows:</p>
<p class="bas indent2"><span class="nm">1.</span>If one wound a good wick around something we may not light with, one may not light with it;</p>
<p class="bas indent2"><span class="nm">2.</span>This is if he lights both wicks - but if he does so to make the wick float, it is permitted;</p>
<p class="bas indent2"><span class="nm">3.</span>R. Shimon ben Gamliel says, in my father's house they would wind a wick around a nut.</p>
<p class="bas indent1"><span class="nm">(j)</span><span class="cl">Question:</span> Rav Beruna permits to put a drop of [good] oil into melted Chelev or fish innards and light with it!</p>
<p class="bas indent1"><span class="nm">(k)</span><span class="cl">Answer:</span> Rabah forbids regarding oils that [by themselves] are not drawn up the wick;</p>
<p class="bas indent2"><span class="nm">1.</span>Melted Chelev or dissolved fish innards themselves are drawn up the wick, it is only a decree not to use them by themselves, lest one will use solid Chelev or fish innards that are not dissolved.</p>
<p class="bas indent1"><span class="nm">(l)</span><span class="cl">Question:</span> We should decree not to use melted Chelev or fish innards with a drop of oil, lest one use them without a drop of oil!</p>
<p class="bas indent1"><span class="nm">(m)</span><span class="cl">Answer:</span> It is only a decree not to use them by themselves - we do not make a decree on account of a decree!</p>
<p class="bas indent1"><span class="nm">(n)</span><span class="cl">(Rami bar Chama - Beraisa):</span> The oils and wicks forbidden to use on Shabbos may not be used in the Mikdash - "Leha'alos Ner Tamid". (Cheshek Shlomo deletes 'oils' from the text, for the Torah explicitly requires olive oil for the Menorah.)</p>
<p class="bas indent1"><span class="nm">(o)</span><span class="cl">(Implied question: How do we learn this from the verse? Answer) (Rami bar Chama):</span> This teaches that the flame must go up by itself without anything to help it.</p>
<p class="bas indent1"><span class="nm">(p)</span><span class="cl">Question (Mishnah):</span> Worn out Michnesayim (pants) and belts (Avnetim) of Kohanim were used to make wicks for lamps at the Simchas Beis ha'Sho'evah (celebrations in the Mikdash on Sukos.) (The Avnet is mostly of wool!)</p>
<p class="bas indent1"><span class="nm">(q)</span><span class="cl">Answer:</span> The Simchas Beis ha'Sho'evah is different ("Leha'alos Ner Tamid" applies only to the Menorah).</p>
<p class="bas indent1"><span class="nm">(r)</span><span class="cl">Question (Beraisa):</span> Worn out Bigdei Kehunah were used to make wicks used in the Mikdash.</p>
<p class="bas indent2"><span class="nm">1.</span><span class="cl">Suggestion:</span> Even Bigdei Kehunah with Kil'ayim (wool and linen) were used (even though wool is Pasul)!</p>
<p class="bas indent1"><span class="nm">(s)</span><span class="cl">Answer:</span> No, only linen Bigdei Kehunah were used.</p>
<p class="bas subject"><span class="nm">3)</span>WHAT MAY BE USED FOR <i>NEROS CHANUKAH</i>?</p>
<p class="bas indent1"><span class="nm">(a)</span><span class="cl">(Rav Huna):</span> The oils and wicks forbidden to use on Shabbos may not be used for Ner Chanukah, not during the week nor on Shabbos.</p>
<p class="bas indent1"><span class="nm">(b)</span><span class="cl">(Rava):</span> Rav Huna holds that if the Ner extinguished, one must relight it (he forbids Pesulim on weekdays, perhaps the Ner will go out and he will neglect to relight it);</p>
<p class="bas indent2"><span class="nm">1.</span>He permits using the light (he forbids Pesulim on Shabbos, perhaps he will use the light and come to fix the flame).</p>
<p class="bas indent1"><span class="nm">(c)</span><span class="cl">(Rav Chisda):</span> They may be used during the week, but not on Shabbos.</p>
<p class="bas indent2"><span class="nm">1.</span>He holds that if it extinguished, one need not relight it; he permits using the light.</p>
<p class="bas bbbline">21b----------------------------------------21b</p>
<p class="bas indent1"><span class="nm">(d)</span><span class="cl">(Rav):</span> They may be used during the week and on Shabbos.</p>
<p class="bas indent1"><span class="nm">(e)</span><span class="cl">(R. Yirmeyah):</span> He holds that if it extinguished, one need not relight it; he forbids using the light.</p>
<p class="bas indent1"><span class="nm">(f)</span>Abaye heard this in the name of R. Yirmeyah, but did not accept it; he later heard that R. Yochanan said so, and accepted it.</p>
<p class="bas indent1"><span class="nm">(g)</span><span class="cl">Abaye:</span> Had I merited, I would have accepted it the first time!</p>
<p class="bas indent1"><span class="nm">(h)</span><span class="cl">Question:</span> Why was Abaye upset - he accepted the teaching in the end!</p>
<p class="bas indent1"><span class="nm">(i)</span><span class="cl">Answer:</span> One remembers better what he learns in his youth.</p>
<p class="bas indent1"><span class="nm">(j)</span><span class="cl">(Said in the name of Rav Chisda and Rav):</span> If it extinguished, one need not relight it.</p>
<p class="bas indent1"><span class="nm">(k)</span><span class="cl">Question (Beraisa):</span> The Mitzvah is for Ner Chanukah to burn from sunset until the last people cease from the market.</p>
<p class="bas indent2"><span class="nm">1.</span><span class="cl">Suggestion:</span> If it was extinguished, one must relight it!</p>
<p class="bas indent1"><span class="nm">(l)</span><span class="cl">Answer #1:</span> No, this teaches that if one did not light at sunset, he may still light until this time.</p>
<p class="bas indent1"><span class="nm">(m)</span><span class="cl">Answer #2:</span> No, this teaches that one must put enough oil to burn until then.</p>
<p class="bas indent1"><span class="nm">(n)</span><span class="cl">(Beraisa):</span> ...Until the last people cease from the market.</p>
<p class="bas indent1"><span class="nm">(o)</span><span class="cl">Question:</span> Who are these people?</p>
<p class="bas indent1"><span class="nm">(p)</span><span class="cl">Answer (Rabah bar bar Chanah):</span> They are Tarmudim (a nation, they gather twigs from the market after everyone else leaves).</p>
<p class="bas subject"><span class="nm">4)</span>HOW TO LIGHT <i>NEROS CHANUKAH</i></p>
<p class="bas indent1"><span class="nm">(a)</span><span class="cl">(Beraisa):</span> The Mitzvah is for Ner Chanukah is for a man to burn one Ner for his household [on each night];</p>
<p class="bas indent2"><span class="nm">1.</span>Mehadrin (people who beautify Mitzvos) light a Ner for every member of the household;</p>
<p class="bas indent2"><span class="nm">2.</span>Beis Shamai say, Mehadrin Min ha'Mehadrin (who exceedingly beautify Mitzvos) light eight Neros the first night (Tosfos - on behalf of the entire household; Rama (671:2) - every member of the household does so), and one less every succeeding night.</p>
<p class="bas indent2"><span class="nm">3.</span>Beis Hillel say, they light one Ner the first night, and add one every night.</p>
<p class="bas indent1"><span class="nm">(b)</span><span class="cl">(R. Yosi bar Avin or R. Yosi bar Zevida):</span> Beis Shamai light according to the number of days remaining, Beis Hillel light according to the number of days that have passed;</p>
<p class="bas indent1"><span class="nm">(c)</span><span class="cl">(The other of R. Yosi bar Avin and R. Yosi bar Zevida):</span> Beis Shamai learn from the bulls offered on Sukos (13 the first day, and one less every succeeding day), Beis Hillel apply the principal 'We ascend in Kedushah, we do not descend.'</p>
<p class="bas indent1"><span class="nm">(d)</span><span class="cl">(Rabah bar bar Chanah):</span> There were two elders in Tzidon; one did like Beis Shamai, the other like Beis Hillel - their reasoning was like the latter explanation.</p>
<p class="bas indent1"><span class="nm">(e)</span><span class="cl">(Beraisa):</span> The Mitzvah is to leave Ner Chanukah outside the door of one's house; one who lives in an upper story should leave it near a window near Reshus ha'Rabim.</p>
<p class="bas indent1"><span class="nm">(f)</span>At a time of danger (from Nochrim), it suffices to leave it on one's table (people outside will not see it).</p>
<p class="bas indent1"><span class="nm">(g)</span><span class="cl">(Rava):</span> One must light an extra Ner to use its light (so he will not benefit from Neros Chanukah).</p>
<p class="bas indent1"><span class="nm">(h)</span>If there is a big fire [in the house], he does not need an extra Ner;</p>
<p class="bas indent1"><span class="nm">(i)</span>A distinguished person [normally does not use a bonfire, he] must light an extra Ner even if there is a big fire.</p>
<p class="bas indent1"><span class="nm">(j)</span><span class="cl">Question:</span> Why was Chanukah enacted?</p>
<p class="bas indent1"><span class="nm">(k)</span><span class="cl">Answer (Beraisa):</span> The eight nights of Chanukah begin on the 25th of Kislev;</p>
<p class="bas indent1"><span class="nm">(l)</span>It is forbidden to eulogize or fast on these days, for the Yevanim entered the Heichal and were Metamei all the oil there; when Malchus Beis Chashmonai overpowered them, they checked and found only one flask of oil with the seal of the Kohen Gadol. (Tosfos - if Chachamim had already decreed Tum'ah on Nochri Zavim, we must say that the flask was in the ground, the seal showed that it had not been moved.)</p>
<p class="bas indent1"><span class="nm">(m)</span>The flask had the amount of oil needed for one night - miraculously, it lasted for eight nights. (Beis Yosef 670 (veha'Ta'am) discusses how they apportioned the oil.)</p>
<p class="bas indent1"><span class="nm">(n)</span>The following year, they fixed these days to be Yomim Tovim, to say Hallel and Hoda'ah (Al ha'Nisim in Shemoneh Esre).</p>
<p class="bas indent1"><span class="nm">(o)</span><span class="cl">(Mishnah):</span> If a spark flew out from a man's hammer and damaged, he is liable;</p>
<p class="bas indent1"><span class="nm">(p)</span>If Reuven's camel, laden with flax, was walking in Reshus ha'Rabim, and the flax entered Shimon's store, caught fire from Shimon's lamp, and burned the building - Reuven is liable;</p>
<p class="bas indent2"><span class="nm">1.</span>If the lamp was outside, Shimon is liable.</p>
<p class="bas indent2"><span class="nm">2.</span>R. Yehudah says, if it was Ner Chanukah, he is exempt.</p>
<p class="bas indent1"><span class="nm">(q)</span><span class="cl">(Ravina):</span> From R. Yehudah, we learn that Neros Chanukah must be placed within 10 Tefachim of the ground.</p>
<p class="bas indent2"><span class="nm">1.</span>If it was permitted to place them higher, Shimon should be liable, he should have put it higher than a camel and its rider, to avoid damage!</p>
<p class="bas indent1"><span class="nm">(r)</span><span class="cl">Rejection:</span> (Really, one may put them above 10;) Chachamim did not obligate one to place it so high, lest he refrain from the Mitzvah.</p>
<p class="bas indent1"><span class="nm">(s)</span><span class="cl">(Rav Kahana):</span> If the lights of Chanukah were placed above 20 Amos, this does not fulfill the Mitzvah, just as a Sukah or Korah (a beam to permit carrying in an alleyway) more than 20 Amos high is invalid.</p>
