<div class="subject"><span class="nm">1)</span><p>TUMTUM</p></div>
<div class="indent1"><span class="nm">(a)</span><p><span class="cl">(Mishnah - Chachamim):</span> It has no Kedushas Bechor. One may shear it and work with it.</p></div>
<div class="indent1"><span class="nm">(b)</span><p><span class="cl">(Rav Chisda):</span> The Tana'im argue about Androginus, but all agree that Tumtum is a Safek male or female, and is judged to be Kodesh because of reasonable possibility that it is a male.</p></div>
<div class="indent1"><span class="nm">(c)</span><p><span class="cl">Question (Rava):</span> If so, a human Tumtum should be Ne'erach! (If one says "Erech Ploni Alai," this obligates him to give to Hekdesh a certain amount based on Ploni's age and gender.)</p></div>
<div class="indent2"><span class="nm">1.</span><p><span class="cl">(Beraisa):</span> "Ha'Zachar" excludes Tumtum and Androginus (from Erchin);</p></div>
<div class="indent3"><span class="nm">i.</span><p><span class="cl">Suggestion:</span> Perhaps this teaches that Erech of a male does not apply to them, rather, Erech Nekevah!</p></div>
<div class="indent3"><span class="nm">ii.</span><p><span class="cl">Rejection:</span> "V'Hayah Erkecha ha'Zachar... v'Im Nekevah Hi" teaches that Erchin applies to a known male or female, but not to a Tumtum or Androginus.</p></div>
<div class="indent1"><span class="nm">(d)</span><p><span class="cl">Answer (Rav Chisda):</span> We must delete "Tumtum" from the text of the Beraisa.</p></div>
<div class="indent1"><span class="nm">(e)</span><p><span class="cl">Question (Beraisa):</span> "Im Zachar Im Nekevah" teaches that a Shelamim must be a known male or female, but not a Tumtum or Androginus.</p></div>
<div class="indent1"><span class="nm">(f)</span><p><span class="cl">Answer:</span> We must delete "Tumtum" from the text.</p></div>
<div class="indent1"><span class="nm">(g)</span><p><span class="cl">Question (Beraisa):</span> (Olah must be) "Zachar", and not a female;</p></div>
<div class="indent2"><span class="nm">1.</span><p><span class="cl">Question:</span> Another verse requires Olah to be "Zachar". What do we learn from it?</p></div>
<div class="indent2"><span class="nm">2.</span><p><span class="cl">Answer:</span> It excludes Tumtum and Androginus.</p></div>

<div class="indent1"><span class="nm">(i)</span><p><span class="cl">Question (Beraisa):</span> (The following are Pasul for Korbanos. Therefore,) if Melikah of such a bird was done, it (is a Nevelah, and) has Tum'as Beis ha'Beli'ah (if one swallows it, he and his clothing become Tamei): a Ne'evad, Muktzah, Esnan (wages of a harlot), Mechir Kelev (something traded for a dog), Tumtum and Androginus;</p></div>
<div class="indent2"><span class="nm">1.</span><p>R. Eliezer says, Tumtum or Androginus does not have Tum'as Beis ha'Beli'ah.</p></div>
<div class="indent2"><span class="nm">2.</span><p><span class="cl">R. Eliezer:</span> We exclude Tumtum and Androginus only when the Torah says Zachar and Nekevah. Regarding birds, it does not say Zachar and Nekevah.</p></div>
<div class="indent1"><span class="nm">(j)</span><p><span class="cl">Answer:</span> We must delete "Tumtum" from the text.</p></div>
<div class="indent1"><span class="nm">(k)</span><p><span class="cl">Question (Mishnah - R. Eliezer):</span> The following animals do not become Kadosh or be Mekadesh other animals (this will be explained):</p></div>
<div class="indent2"><span class="nm">1.</span><p>Terefah, Kilayim, Yotzei Dofen, Tumtum and Androginus.</p></div>
<div class="indent2"><span class="nm">2.</span><p><span class="cl">(Shmuel):</span> They do not become Kadosh through Temurah, and (even if they are Kedoshim) they are not Mekadesh other animals through Temurah.</p></div>
<div class="indent1"><span class="nm">(l)</span><p><span class="cl">Answer:</span> We must delete "Tumtum" from the text.</p></div>
<div class="indent1"><span class="nm">(m)</span><p><span class="cl">Question (Beraisa - R. Eliezer):</span> There are five kinds of animals that do not become Kadosh or be Mekadesh:</p></div>
<div class="indent2"><span class="nm">1.</span><p>Terefah, Kilayim, Yotzei Dofen, Tumtum and Androginus.</p></div>
<div class="indent2"><span class="nm">2.</span><p><span class="cl">Suggestion:</span> Perhaps we can delete "Tumtum" from the text.</p></div>
<div class="indent2"><span class="nm">3.</span><p><span class="cl">Rejection:</span> R. Eliezer said that there are five!</p></div>
<div class="indent1"><span class="nm">(n)</span><p><span class="cl">Answer:</span> We must replace "Tumtum" with "Yasom" (an animal orphaned at birth).</p></div>
<div class="indent1"><span class="nm">(o)</span><p><span class="cl">Suggestion:</span> Tana'im argue about this (whether Tumtum is a male or female, or a creation unto itself. This would refute Rav Chisda, who says that all agree that it is either a male or female);</p></div>
<div class="indent2"><span class="nm">1.</span><p><span class="cl">(Beraisa - R. Ilai citing R. Yishmael):</span> Androginus is a Bechor, and it has a Mum.</p></div>
<div class="indent2"><span class="nm">2.</span><p>Chachamim say, Kedushas Bechor does not apply to it.</p></div>
<div class="indent2"><span class="nm">3.</span><p>R. Shimon ben Yehudah says, "ha'Zachar" always excludes Tumtum and Androginus.</p></div>
<div class="indent2"><span class="nm">4.</span><p><span class="cl">Suggestion:</span> Perhaps we can delete "Tumtum" from the text.</p></div>
<div class="indent2"><span class="nm">5.</span><p><span class="cl">Rejection:</span> If so, R. Shimon ben Yehudah is just like Chachamim!</p></div>
<div class="indent2"><span class="nm">6.</span><p><span class="cl">Conclusion:</span> We must say that they argue about Tumtum:</p></div>
<div class="indent3"><span class="nm">i.</span><p>Chachamim hold that Kedushas Bechor does not apply to Androginus, but Tumtum is a Safek male or female, so it is Safek Kadosh;</p></div>
<div class="indent3"><span class="nm">ii.</span><p>R. Shimon holds that Tumtum is a creation unto itself. It is not Kadosh.</p></div>
<div class="bbbline">42b----------------------------------------42b</p></div>
<div class="indent1"><span class="nm">(p)</span><p><span class="cl">Answer:</span> No, no one considers it to be a creation unto itself. The only doubt is whether it is a male or female;</p></div>
<div class="indent2"><span class="nm">1.</span><p>If it urinates from the front (where the male Ever should be), all agree that it is a definite male;</p></div>
<div class="indent2"><span class="nm">2.</span><p>They argue about one that urinates from the back (the place of female genitals):</p></div>
<div class="indent3"><span class="nm">i.</span><p>Chachamim are concerned lest it is a male, and the Ever is in the wrong place;</p></div>
<div class="indent3"><span class="nm">ii.</span><p>R. Shimon is not concerned for this.</p></div>
<div class="subject"><span class="nm">2)</span><p>THE DOUBTS ABOUT TUMTUM</p></div>
<div class="indent1"><span class="nm">(a)</span><p>R. Elazar ruled like (this understanding of) R. Shimon. If a firstborn Tumtum urinates from the back, it is Chulin.</p></div>
<div class="indent1"><span class="nm">(b)</span><p><span class="cl">R. Yochanan:</span> How can you rule (leniently) against the first Tana (of our Mishnah) and R. Yishmael?!</p></div>
<div class="indent2"><span class="nm">1.</span><p><span class="cl">Question:</span> R. Yochanan should also mention that he ruled against the latter Chachamim of our Mishnah, for Rav Chisda taught they argue only about Androginus, but all agree that Tumtum is Safek Kodesh!</p></div>
<div class="indent2"><span class="nm">2.</span><p><span class="cl">Answer:</span> R. Yochanan disagrees with Rav Chisda.</p></div>
<div class="indent2"><span class="nm">3.</span><p><span class="cl">Question:</span> If so, R. Yochanan holds that the latter Chachamim say that Tumtum is Chulin. Why did he object to R. Elazar's ruling? It is like the latter Chachamim!</p></div>
<div class="indent2"><span class="nm">4.</span><p><span class="cl">Answer:</span> Indeed, he objected because R. Elazar ruled like one opinion in the Mishnah against two opinions.</p></div>
<div class="indent1"><span class="nm">(c)</span><p><span class="cl">Question:</span> Whom does R. Elazar hold like? (I.e. why did he rule like the minority opinion?)</p></div>
<div class="indent1"><span class="nm">(d)</span><p><span class="cl">Answer:</span> He holds like Reish Lakish;</p></div>
<div class="indent2"><span class="nm">1.</span><p><span class="cl">(Reish Lakish):</span> Only a human Tumtum is a Safek, because the male and female genitals are in the same place, but there is no doubt about an animal;</p></div>
<div class="indent3"><span class="nm">i.</span><p>If it urinates from the front it is a male. If it urinates from the back, it is a female.</p></div>
<div class="indent2"><span class="nm">2.</span><p><span class="cl">Objection (R. Oshaya):</span> Also regarding animals, we are concerned lest the Ever is in the wrong place!</p></div>
<div class="indent2"><span class="nm">3.</span><p><span class="cl">Question (Abaye):</span> Does R. Oshaya hold like R. Meir, who is concerned for the minority?!</p></div>
<div class="indent2"><span class="nm">4.</span><p><span class="cl">Answer (Abaye bar Avin):</span> No, he asks even according to Chachamim (who normally rely on the majority. The Halachah follows them.) Ho'il v'Ishtani, Ishtani. (Since it is different than normal animals in one way (its genitals are covered), we are concerned lest it is different also in other ways, i.e. its genitals are in the wrong place);</p></div>
<div class="indent3"><span class="nm">i.</span><p>The first Tana (of the Beraisa) says Ho'il v'Ishtani Ishtani. R. Shimon does not. (This sums up the question against Reish Lakish, who says that no Tana has doubts about a Tumtum animal.)</p></div>
<div class="indent1"><span class="nm">(e)</span><p><span class="cl">Suggestion:</span> Tana'im argue (elsewhere) about whether we say Ho'il v'Ishtani Ishtani:</p></div>
<div class="indent2"><span class="nm">1.</span><p><span class="cl">(Beraisa #1):</span> If a Tumtum was Mekadesh a woman, she is (Safek) Mekudeshes. If a man was Mekadesh the Tumtum, the Tumtum is (Safek) Mekudeshes;</p></div>
<div class="indent2"><span class="nm">2.</span><p>If the Tumtum's brother died without children, the Tumtum can do Chalitzah. If the Tumtum died (without children), his widow can do Yibum or Chalitzah;</p></div>
<div class="indent2"><span class="nm">3.</span><p><span class="cl">(Beraisa #2):</span> The Tumtum's widow can do Chalitzah, but not Yibum.</p></div>
<div class="indent2"><span class="nm">4.</span><p><span class="cl">Suggestion:</span> Both Tana'im hold like R. Akiva, who says that a Seris Chamah (a male who does not have normal male development and never had potential to have children) does not do Chalitzah or Yibum;</p></div>
<div class="indent3"><span class="nm">i.</span><p>Tana #1 does not say Ho'il v'Ishtani Ishtani (even though he is a Tumtum, we are not concerned lest he is a Seris Chamah). Tana #2 says Ho'il v'Ishtani Ishtani.</p></div>
<div class="indent1"><span class="nm">(f)</span><p><span class="cl">Rejection:</span> No, all say Ho'il v'Ishtani Ishtani;</p></div>
<div class="indent2"><span class="nm">1.</span><p>Tana #1 holds like R. Eliezer (who says that Yibum and Chalitzah apply to a Seris Chamah, because he can be healed and have children). Tana #2 holds like R. Akiva.</p></div>
<div class="indent1"><span class="nm">(g)</span><p><span class="cl">Question:</span> Within R. Akiva's opinion, like which Tana does Tana #2 hold?</p></div>
<div class="indent2"><span class="nm">1.</span><p>He cannot hold like R. Yehudah (in the following Mishnah), for then he would be a definite Seris!</p></div>
<div class="indent3"><span class="nm">i.</span><p><span class="cl">(Mishnah - R. Yehudah):</span> If (the skin covering the genitals of) a Tumtum was torn and he was found to be male, he does not do Chalitzah, for he is like a Seris.</p></div>
<div class="indent1"><span class="nm">(h)</span><p><span class="cl">Answer:</span> He holds like R. Yosi b'Rebbi Yehudah:</p></div>
<div class="indent2"><span class="nm">1.</span><p><span class="cl">(Beraisa - R. Yosi b'Rebbi Yehudah):</span> A Tumtum does not do Chalitzah, lest he be torn and found to be a Seris Chamah.</p></div>
<div class="indent2"><span class="nm">2.</span><p><span class="cl">Objection:</span> This implies that he is definitely a male, and the only doubt is whether he is a Seris;</p></div>
<div class="indent3"><span class="nm">i.</span><p>Perhaps "he" is really female!</p></div>
<div class="indent2"><span class="nm">3.</span><p><span class="cl">Answer:</span> Indeed, the Tana discusses two concerns;</p></div>
<div class="indent3"><span class="nm">i.</span><p>He does not do Chalitzah, lest he be torn and found to be female;</p></div>
<div class="indent3"><span class="nm">ii.</span><p>Even if he is male, perhaps he is a Seris!</p></div>
<div class="indent1"><span class="nm">(i)</span><p><span class="cl">Question:</span> What difference does it make if a Tumtum (found to be male) is a definite or Safek Seris?</p></div>
