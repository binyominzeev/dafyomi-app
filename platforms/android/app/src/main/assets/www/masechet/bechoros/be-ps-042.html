<p class="bas subject"><span class="nm">1)</span>TUMTUM</p>
<p class="bas indent1"><span class="nm">(a)</span><span class="cl">(Mishnah - Chachamim):</span> It has no Kedushas Bechor. One may shear it and work with it.</p>
<p class="bas indent1"><span class="nm">(b)</span><span class="cl">(Rav Chisda):</span> The Tana'im argue about Androginus, but all agree that Tumtum is a Safek male or female, and is judged to be Kodesh because of reasonable possibility that it is a male.</p>
<p class="bas indent1"><span class="nm">(c)</span><span class="cl">Question (Rava):</span> If so, a human Tumtum should be Ne'erach! (If one says "Erech Ploni Alai," this obligates him to give to Hekdesh a certain amount based on Ploni's age and gender.)</p>
<p class="bas indent2"><span class="nm">1.</span><span class="cl">(Beraisa):</span> "Ha'Zachar" excludes Tumtum and Androginus (from Erchin);</p>
<p class="bas indent3"><span class="nm">i.</span><span class="cl">Suggestion:</span> Perhaps this teaches that Erech of a male does not apply to them, rather, Erech Nekevah!</p>
<p class="bas indent3"><span class="nm">ii.</span><span class="cl">Rejection:</span> "V'Hayah Erkecha ha'Zachar... v'Im Nekevah Hi" teaches that Erchin applies to a known male or female, but not to a Tumtum or Androginus.</p>
<p class="bas indent1"><span class="nm">(d)</span><span class="cl">Answer (Rav Chisda):</span> We must delete "Tumtum" from the text of the Beraisa.</p>
<p class="bas indent1"><span class="nm">(e)</span><span class="cl">Question (Beraisa):</span> "Im Zachar Im Nekevah" teaches that a Shelamim must be a known male or female, but not a Tumtum or Androginus.</p>
<p class="bas indent1"><span class="nm">(f)</span><span class="cl">Answer:</span> We must delete "Tumtum" from the text.</p>
<p class="bas indent1"><span class="nm">(g)</span><span class="cl">Question (Beraisa):</span> (Olah must be) "Zachar", and not a female;</p>
<p class="bas indent2"><span class="nm">1.</span><span class="cl">Question:</span> Another verse requires Olah to be "Zachar". What do we learn from it?</p>
<p class="bas indent2"><span class="nm">2.</span><span class="cl">Answer:</span> It excludes Tumtum and Androginus.</p>
<p class="bas indent1"><span class="nm">(h)</span><span class="cl">Answer:</span> We must delete "Tumtum" from the text.</p>
<p class="bas indent1"><span class="nm">(i)</span><span class="cl">Question (Beraisa):</span> (The following are Pasul for Korbanos. Therefore,) if Melikah of such a bird was done, it (is a Nevelah, and) has Tum'as Beis ha'Beli'ah (if one swallows it, he and his clothing become Tamei): a Ne'evad, Muktzah, Esnan (wages of a harlot), Mechir Kelev (something traded for a dog), Tumtum and Androginus;</p>
<p class="bas indent2"><span class="nm">1.</span>R. Eliezer says, Tumtum or Androginus does not have Tum'as Beis ha'Beli'ah.</p>
<p class="bas indent2"><span class="nm">2.</span><span class="cl">R. Eliezer:</span> We exclude Tumtum and Androginus only when the Torah says Zachar and Nekevah. Regarding birds, it does not say Zachar and Nekevah.</p>
<p class="bas indent1"><span class="nm">(j)</span><span class="cl">Answer:</span> We must delete "Tumtum" from the text.</p>
<p class="bas indent1"><span class="nm">(k)</span><span class="cl">Question (Mishnah - R. Eliezer):</span> The following animals do not become Kadosh or be Mekadesh other animals (this will be explained):</p>
<p class="bas indent2"><span class="nm">1.</span>Terefah, Kilayim, Yotzei Dofen, Tumtum and Androginus.</p>
<p class="bas indent2"><span class="nm">2.</span><span class="cl">(Shmuel):</span> They do not become Kadosh through Temurah, and (even if they are Kedoshim) they are not Mekadesh other animals through Temurah.</p>
<p class="bas indent1"><span class="nm">(l)</span><span class="cl">Answer:</span> We must delete "Tumtum" from the text.</p>
<p class="bas indent1"><span class="nm">(m)</span><span class="cl">Question (Beraisa - R. Eliezer):</span> There are five kinds of animals that do not become Kadosh or be Mekadesh:</p>
<p class="bas indent2"><span class="nm">1.</span>Terefah, Kilayim, Yotzei Dofen, Tumtum and Androginus.</p>
<p class="bas indent2"><span class="nm">2.</span><span class="cl">Suggestion:</span> Perhaps we can delete "Tumtum" from the text.</p>
<p class="bas indent2"><span class="nm">3.</span><span class="cl">Rejection:</span> R. Eliezer said that there are five!</p>
<p class="bas indent1"><span class="nm">(n)</span><span class="cl">Answer:</span> We must replace "Tumtum" with "Yasom" (an animal orphaned at birth).</p>
<p class="bas indent1"><span class="nm">(o)</span><span class="cl">Suggestion:</span> Tana'im argue about this (whether Tumtum is a male or female, or a creation unto itself. This would refute Rav Chisda, who says that all agree that it is either a male or female);</p>
<p class="bas indent2"><span class="nm">1.</span><span class="cl">(Beraisa - R. Ilai citing R. Yishmael):</span> Androginus is a Bechor, and it has a Mum.</p>
<p class="bas indent2"><span class="nm">2.</span>Chachamim say, Kedushas Bechor does not apply to it.</p>
<p class="bas indent2"><span class="nm">3.</span>R. Shimon ben Yehudah says, "ha'Zachar" always excludes Tumtum and Androginus.</p>
<p class="bas indent2"><span class="nm">4.</span><span class="cl">Suggestion:</span> Perhaps we can delete "Tumtum" from the text.</p>
<p class="bas indent2"><span class="nm">5.</span><span class="cl">Rejection:</span> If so, R. Shimon ben Yehudah is just like Chachamim!</p>
<p class="bas indent2"><span class="nm">6.</span><span class="cl">Conclusion:</span> We must say that they argue about Tumtum:</p>
<p class="bas indent3"><span class="nm">i.</span>Chachamim hold that Kedushas Bechor does not apply to Androginus, but Tumtum is a Safek male or female, so it is Safek Kadosh;</p>
<p class="bas indent3"><span class="nm">ii.</span>R. Shimon holds that Tumtum is a creation unto itself. It is not Kadosh.</p>
<p class="bas bbbline">42b----------------------------------------42b</p>
<p class="bas indent1"><span class="nm">(p)</span><span class="cl">Answer:</span> No, no one considers it to be a creation unto itself. The only doubt is whether it is a male or female;</p>
<p class="bas indent2"><span class="nm">1.</span>If it urinates from the front (where the male Ever should be), all agree that it is a definite male;</p>
<p class="bas indent2"><span class="nm">2.</span>They argue about one that urinates from the back (the place of female genitals):</p>
<p class="bas indent3"><span class="nm">i.</span>Chachamim are concerned lest it is a male, and the Ever is in the wrong place;</p>
<p class="bas indent3"><span class="nm">ii.</span>R. Shimon is not concerned for this.</p>
<p class="bas subject"><span class="nm">2)</span>THE DOUBTS ABOUT <i>TUMTUM</i></p>
<p class="bas indent1"><span class="nm">(a)</span>R. Elazar ruled like (this understanding of) R. Shimon. If a firstborn Tumtum urinates from the back, it is Chulin.</p>
<p class="bas indent1"><span class="nm">(b)</span><span class="cl">R. Yochanan:</span> How can you rule (leniently) against the first Tana (of our Mishnah) and R. Yishmael?!</p>
<p class="bas indent2"><span class="nm">1.</span><span class="cl">Question:</span> R. Yochanan should also mention that he ruled against the latter Chachamim of our Mishnah, for Rav Chisda taught they argue only about Androginus, but all agree that Tumtum is Safek Kodesh!</p>
<p class="bas indent2"><span class="nm">2.</span><span class="cl">Answer:</span> R. Yochanan disagrees with Rav Chisda.</p>
<p class="bas indent2"><span class="nm">3.</span><span class="cl">Question:</span> If so, R. Yochanan holds that the latter Chachamim say that Tumtum is Chulin. Why did he object to R. Elazar's ruling? It is like the latter Chachamim!</p>
<p class="bas indent2"><span class="nm">4.</span><span class="cl">Answer:</span> Indeed, he objected because R. Elazar ruled like one opinion in the Mishnah against two opinions.</p>
<p class="bas indent1"><span class="nm">(c)</span><span class="cl">Question:</span> Whom does R. Elazar hold like? (I.e. why did he rule like the minority opinion?)</p>
<p class="bas indent1"><span class="nm">(d)</span><span class="cl">Answer:</span> He holds like Reish Lakish;</p>
<p class="bas indent2"><span class="nm">1.</span><span class="cl">(Reish Lakish):</span> Only a human Tumtum is a Safek, because the male and female genitals are in the same place, but there is no doubt about an animal;</p>
<p class="bas indent3"><span class="nm">i.</span>If it urinates from the front it is a male. If it urinates from the back, it is a female.</p>
<p class="bas indent2"><span class="nm">2.</span><span class="cl">Objection (R. Oshaya):</span> Also regarding animals, we are concerned lest the Ever is in the wrong place!</p>
<p class="bas indent2"><span class="nm">3.</span><span class="cl">Question (Abaye):</span> Does R. Oshaya hold like R. Meir, who is concerned for the minority?!</p>
<p class="bas indent2"><span class="nm">4.</span><span class="cl">Answer (Abaye bar Avin):</span> No, he asks even according to Chachamim (who normally rely on the majority. The Halachah follows them.) Ho'il v'Ishtani, Ishtani. (Since it is different than normal animals in one way (its genitals are covered), we are concerned lest it is different also in other ways, i.e. its genitals are in the wrong place);</p>
<p class="bas indent3"><span class="nm">i.</span>The first Tana (of the Beraisa) says Ho'il v'Ishtani Ishtani. R. Shimon does not. (This sums up the question against Reish Lakish, who says that no Tana has doubts about a Tumtum animal.)</p>
<p class="bas indent1"><span class="nm">(e)</span><span class="cl">Suggestion:</span> Tana'im argue (elsewhere) about whether we say Ho'il v'Ishtani Ishtani:</p>
<p class="bas indent2"><span class="nm">1.</span><span class="cl">(Beraisa #1):</span> If a Tumtum was Mekadesh a woman, she is (Safek) Mekudeshes. If a man was Mekadesh the Tumtum, the Tumtum is (Safek) Mekudeshes;</p>
<p class="bas indent2"><span class="nm">2.</span>If the Tumtum's brother died without children, the Tumtum can do Chalitzah. If the Tumtum died (without children), his widow can do Yibum or Chalitzah;</p>
<p class="bas indent2"><span class="nm">3.</span><span class="cl">(Beraisa #2):</span> The Tumtum's widow can do Chalitzah, but not Yibum.</p>
<p class="bas indent2"><span class="nm">4.</span><span class="cl">Suggestion:</span> Both Tana'im hold like R. Akiva, who says that a Seris Chamah (a male who does not have normal male development and never had potential to have children) does not do Chalitzah or Yibum;</p>
<p class="bas indent3"><span class="nm">i.</span>Tana #1 does not say Ho'il v'Ishtani Ishtani (even though he is a Tumtum, we are not concerned lest he is a Seris Chamah). Tana #2 says Ho'il v'Ishtani Ishtani.</p>
<p class="bas indent1"><span class="nm">(f)</span><span class="cl">Rejection:</span> No, all say Ho'il v'Ishtani Ishtani;</p>
<p class="bas indent2"><span class="nm">1.</span>Tana #1 holds like R. Eliezer (who says that Yibum and Chalitzah apply to a Seris Chamah, because he can be healed and have children). Tana #2 holds like R. Akiva.</p>
<p class="bas indent1"><span class="nm">(g)</span><span class="cl">Question:</span> Within R. Akiva's opinion, like which Tana does Tana #2 hold?</p>
<p class="bas indent2"><span class="nm">1.</span>He cannot hold like R. Yehudah (in the following Mishnah), for then he would be a definite Seris!</p>
<p class="bas indent3"><span class="nm">i.</span><span class="cl">(Mishnah - R. Yehudah):</span> If (the skin covering the genitals of) a Tumtum was torn and he was found to be male, he does not do Chalitzah, for he is like a Seris.</p>
<p class="bas indent1"><span class="nm">(h)</span><span class="cl">Answer:</span> He holds like R. Yosi b'Rebbi Yehudah:</p>
<p class="bas indent2"><span class="nm">1.</span><span class="cl">(Beraisa - R. Yosi b'Rebbi Yehudah):</span> A Tumtum does not do Chalitzah, lest he be torn and found to be a Seris Chamah.</p>
<p class="bas indent2"><span class="nm">2.</span><span class="cl">Objection:</span> This implies that he is definitely a male, and the only doubt is whether he is a Seris;</p>
<p class="bas indent3"><span class="nm">i.</span>Perhaps "he" is really female!</p>
<p class="bas indent2"><span class="nm">3.</span><span class="cl">Answer:</span> Indeed, the Tana discusses two concerns;</p>
<p class="bas indent3"><span class="nm">i.</span>He does not do Chalitzah, lest he be torn and found to be female;</p>
<p class="bas indent3"><span class="nm">ii.</span>Even if he is male, perhaps he is a Seris!</p>
<p class="bas indent1"><span class="nm">(i)</span><span class="cl">Question:</span> What difference does it make if a Tumtum (found to be male) is a definite or Safek Seris?</p>
