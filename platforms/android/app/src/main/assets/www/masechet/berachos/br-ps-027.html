<p class="bas indent1"><span class="nm">(a)</span><span class="cl">(Mishnah - R. Yehudah):</span> He may pray "Ad" (until) four hours.</p>
<p class="bas indent1"><span class="nm">(b)</span><span class="cl">Question:</span> Does he mean "Ad v'Ad Bichlal" (up to and including, i.e. until the end of four hours), or "Ad v'Lo Ad Bichlal" (up to but not including, i.e. until the start of the fourth hour)?</p>
<p class="bas indent1"><span class="nm">(c)</span><span class="cl">Answer (Seifa - R. Yehudah):</span> One may pray [Minchah] "Ad Plag ha'Minchah."</p>
<p class="bas indent1"><span class="nm">(d)</span>(This is not in Tosfos' text of the Mishnah, Tosfos changes references to the "Seifa" to "Beraisa #2.")</p>
<p class="bas indent2"><span class="nm">1.</span>We understand this if he means Ad v'Lo Ad Bichlal -- he permits until the start of Plag ha'Minchah, Chachamim allow until evening;</p>
<p class="bas indent2"><span class="nm">2.</span>But if he means Ad v'Ad Bichlal, this is like Chachamim!</p>
<p class="bas indent1"><span class="nm">(e)</span><span class="cl">Objection:</span> In the Seifa, he means Ad v'Ad Bichlal!</p>
<p class="bas indent2"><span class="nm">1.</span><span class="cl">(Mishnah (or a Beraisa)):</span> The time for Musaf is the entire day.</p>
<p class="bas indent2"><span class="nm">2.</span>R. Yehudah says, it is "Ad" seven hours of the day.</p>
<p class="bas indent2"><span class="nm">3.</span><span class="cl">(Beraisa):</span> If one has an obligation [now] to pray both Minchah and Musaf, he prays Minchah first, for it is more frequent;</p>
<p class="bas indent2"><span class="nm">4.</span>R. Yehudah says, he prays Musaf first, for its time will expire soon, Minchah's time will not.</p>
<p class="bas indent2"><span class="nm">5.</span>We understand this if he means Ad v'Ad Bichlal -- he permits Musaf until the end of seven hours, at the same time he can be obligated to pray Minchah and Musaf (i.e. between six and a half and seven hours);</p>
<p class="bas indent3"><span class="nm">i.</span>But if he means Ad v'Lo Ad Bichlal, he permits Musaf until the end of six hours, which is before the earliest time for Minchah!</p>
<p class="bas indent1"><span class="nm">(f)</span><span class="cl">Question:</span> But if he holds Ad v'Ad Bichlal, the Reisha is difficult, for he agrees with Chachamim! (In Beraisa #3, he permits "Ad" the latter Plag ha'Minchah.)</p>
<p class="bas indent1"><span class="nm">(g)</span><span class="cl">Answer:</span> You assumed that R. Yehudah permits until the beginning of the latter Plag -- this is wrong! Rather, he refers to the first Plag, and permits until it ends;</p>
<p class="bas indent1"><span class="nm">(h)</span>(Either way, he permits until ten and three quarters hours; the only difference is what "Ad" means, which we must clarify in order to understand his opinion regarding Shacharis and Musaf.)</p>
<p class="bas indent2"><span class="nm">1.</span>Beraisa #3 means, R. Yehudah permits <i>until the first Plag ends</i> and the latter begins, i.e. ten and three quarters hours.</p>
<p class="bas indent1"><span class="nm">(i)</span><span class="cl">Support (Rav Nachman - Mishnah):</span> R. Yehudah ben Bava testified about five laws for which he had a tradition:</p>
<p class="bas indent2"><span class="nm">1.</span>We instruct girls to do Mi'un;</p>
<p class="bas indent2"><span class="nm">2.</span>A woman can remarry based on one witness who says that her husband died;</p>
<p class="bas indent2"><span class="nm">3.</span>A chicken was stoned in Yerushalayim because it killed a person;</p>
<p class="bas indent2"><span class="nm">4.</span>Wine may be used for Nesachim forty days after the grapes were pressed;</p>
<p class="bas indent2"><span class="nm">5.</span>The morning Tamid may be offered during the fourth hour of the day.</p>
<p class="bas indent3"><span class="nm">i.</span>[Surely, he holds like R. Yehudah;] this shows that R. Yehudah means Ad v'Ad Bichlal.</p>
<p class="bas indent1"><span class="nm">(j)</span><span class="cl">(Rav Kahana):</span> The Halachah follows R. Yehudah, because the Mishnah in Eduyos follows him. (The Halachah follows every Mishnah in Eduyos.)</p>
<p class="bas indent1"><span class="nm">(k)</span><span class="cl">(Mishnah):</span> The morning Tamid is offered at four hours of the day.</p>
<p class="bas indent1"><span class="nm">(l)</span><span class="cl">Question:</span> Who is the Tana of the following Beraisa?</p>
<p class="bas indent2"><span class="nm">1.</span><span class="cl">(Beraisa):</span> "V'Cham ha'Shemesh v'Namas" -- [the manna melted] at four hours of the day.</p>
<p class="bas indent2"><span class="nm">2.</span><span class="cl">Question:</span> Perhaps it was at six hours of the day!</p>
<p class="bas indent2"><span class="nm">3.</span><span class="cl">Answer:</span> Elsewhere it says "k'Chom ha'Yom," this refers to six hours -- therefore, "v'Cham ha'Shemesh" refers to four hours (this will be explained).</p>
<p class="bas indent2"><span class="nm">4.</span><span class="cl">Summation of question:</span> This is not like R. Yehudah, nor like Chachamim! (Bnei Yisrael collected the manna "ba'Boker ba'Boker" -- <i>afterwards</i>, "v'Cham ha'Shemesh"!</p>
<p class="bas indent3"><span class="nm">i.</span>R. Yehudah says that four hours is still called morning (he is Machshir the morning Tamid until then, even though it says "ba'Boker"), Chachamim say that until Chatzos is morning!</p>
<p class="bas indent1"><span class="nm">(m)</span><span class="cl">Answer #1:</span> It is like Chachamim;</p>
<p class="bas indent2"><span class="nm">1.</span>Regarding the manna it says "ba'Boker ba'Boker" to teach that there were two periods in the morning (in the first half they gathered manna, it melted during the second half).</p>
<p class="bas indent1"><span class="nm">(n)</span><span class="cl">Answer #2:</span> It is like R. Yehudah;</p>
<p class="bas indent2"><span class="nm">1.</span>The extra "ba'Boker" teaches that they collected it an hour before the end of the morning.</p>
<p class="bas indent1"><span class="nm">(o)</span><span class="cl">Question:</span> All agree that it melted at four hours of the day -- how do they learn this from the verse?</p>
<p class="bas indent1"><span class="nm">(p)</span><span class="cl">Answer (Rav Acha bar Yakov):</span> "V'Cham ha'Shemesh" refers to when it is hot only in the sun, not in the shade, i.e. at four hours. (But "k'Chom ha'Yom" is when it is hot even in the shade, at six hours.)</p>
<p class="bas subject"><span class="nm">2)</span>PRAYING MA'ARIV BEFORE EVENING</p>
<p class="bas indent1"><span class="nm">(a)</span><span class="cl">(Mishnah):</span> Minchah is until the evening...</p>
<p class="bas indent1"><span class="nm">(b)</span><span class="cl">Question (Rav Chisda):</span> Rav Kahana said that the Halachah follows R. Yehudah regarding Shacharis;</p>
<p class="bas indent2"><span class="nm">1.</span>Whom does the Halachah follow regarding Minchah?</p>
<p class="bas indent1"><span class="nm">(c)</span>R. Yitzchak could not answer.</p>
<p class="bas indent1"><span class="nm">(d)</span><span class="cl">Answer #1 (Rav Chisda):</span> Rav used to pray Ma'ariv of Shabbos on Erev Shabbos before dark -- this shows that the Halachah follows R. Yehudah! (According to Chachamim, it is still the time for Minchah, one may not pray Ma'ariv then!)</p>
<p class="bas indent1"><span class="nm">(e)</span><span class="cl">Objection and Answer #2:</span> Rav Huna and Rabanan used to wait until dark to pray Ma'ariv -- this shows that the Halachah follows Chachamim!</p>
<p class="bas indent1"><span class="nm">(f)</span><span class="cl">Conclusion:</span> Since the Halachah was not fixed like either opinion, one may follow either one.</p>
<p class="bas indent1"><span class="nm">(g)</span>A case occurred, Rav visited Bei Geniva; he was praying Ma'ariv of Shabbos on Erev Shabbos before dark (he had already accepted Kedushas Shabbos), R. Yirmeyah bar Aba was praying in back of him. Rav finished first, he did not [return to his place, for he would have had to] interrupt between R. Yirmeyah and the wall.</p>
<p class="bas indent1"><span class="nm">(h)</span>We learn three things from this:</p>
<p class="bas indent2"><span class="nm">1.</span>One may pray Ma'ariv of Shabbos on Erev Shabbos;</p>
<p class="bas indent2"><span class="nm">2.</span>A Talmid may pray in back of his Rebbi;</p>
<p class="bas indent2"><span class="nm">3.</span>It is forbidden to pass in front of someone praying.</p>
<p class="bas indent1"><span class="nm">(i)</span>This supports R. Yehoshua ben Levi.</p>
<p class="bas indent2"><span class="nm">1.</span><span class="cl">(R. Yehoshua ben Levi):</span> It is forbidden to pass in front of someone praying.</p>
<p class="bas indent1"><span class="nm">(j)</span><span class="cl">Question:</span> But R. Ami and R. Asi pass in front of someone praying!</p>
<p class="bas indent1"><span class="nm">(k)</span><span class="cl">Answer:</span> They do not pass within four Amos.</p>
<p class="bas indent1"><span class="nm">(l)</span><span class="cl">Question:</span> How could R. Yirmeyah bar Aba pray in back of Rav?</p>
<p class="bas indent2"><span class="nm">1.</span><span class="cl">(Rav Yehudah):</span> One may not pray at the side of his Rebbi (for he thereby "equates" himself to his Rebbi), nor in back of his Rebbi (Rashi - this is haughtiness; Tosfos - it looks like he bows to his Rebbi; Yerushalmi - lest he will cause his Rebbi to have to wait for him to finish).</p>

<p class="bas indent2"><span class="nm">2.</span><span class="cl">(Beraisa - R. Eliezer):</span> The following cause the Shechinah to depart from Yisrael:</p>
<p class="bas indent3"><span class="nm">i.</span>One who prays in back of his Rebbi, gives or returns a greeting of Shalom to his Rebbi (like he does to anyone else), argues with his Rebbi's teaching (i.e. sets up his own academy to expound, without his Rebbi's permission), or says (R. Yonah - in his Rebbi's name) something that he did not hear from his Rebbi.</p>
<p class="bas indent1"><span class="nm">(m)</span><span class="cl">Answer:</span> R. Yirmeyah bar Aba was a Talmid Chaver of Rav (a peer of Rav's who had learned from him).</p>
<p class="bas indent1"><span class="nm">(n)</span><span class="cl">Support:</span> He asked Rav, "Badalta?" ("Have you decided to refrain from Melachah (by accepting Kedushas Shabbos before praying Ma'ariv of Shabbos)?" Rav answered, "Yes";</p>
<p class="bas indent2"><span class="nm">1.</span>A Talmid (who is not a Talmid Chaver) may not address his Rebbi this way (in the second person, rather, in the third person, with a title of respect).</p>
<p class="bas indent1"><span class="nm">(o)</span><span class="cl">Question:</span> Must one indeed accept Shabbos before praying Ma'ariv of Shabbos?!</p>
<p class="bas indent2"><span class="nm">1.</span><span class="cl">(R. Avin):</span> Rebbi once prayed Ma'ariv of Shabbos on Erev Shabbos, entered the bathhouse (which is forbidden on Shabbos) and taught to us!</p>
<p class="bas indent1"><span class="nm">(p)</span><span class="cl">Answer (Rava):</span> Rebbi entered the bathhouse to sweat, before Chachamim prohibited this on Shabbos.</p>
<p class="bas indent1"><span class="nm">(q)</span><span class="cl">Question:</span> But Abaye permitted Rav Dimi bar Livai to fumigate baskets (after praying Ma'ariv of Shabbos on Erev Shabbos)!</p>
<p class="bas indent1"><span class="nm">(r)</span><span class="cl">Answer:</span> The case was, Rav Dimi erred. (He had not intended to accept Kedushas Shabbos early. It was a cloudy day, he thought that night had come. When the sun reappeared, Abaye permitted him to do Melachah.)</p>
<p class="bas indent1"><span class="nm">(s)</span><span class="cl">Question:</span> We do not retract such a mistake!</p>
<p class="bas indent2"><span class="nm">1.</span><span class="cl">(Avidan):</span> Once, it was very cloudy, everyone thought that night had come, they prayed Ma'ariv of Motza'i Shabbos; when the sun reappeared, Rebbi said that they need not pray again.</p>
<p class="bas indent1"><span class="nm">(t)</span><span class="cl">Answer:</span> [An individual would pray again after such a mistake, but] we do not trouble a Tzibur [to return to synagogue to pray again].</p>

<p class="bas indent1"><span class="nm">(a)</span><span class="cl">(R. Chiya bar Avin):</span> Rav used to pray Ma'ariv of Shabbos on Erev Shabbos; R. Yoshiyah used to pray Ma'ariv of Motza'i Shabbos on Shabbos.</p>
<p class="bas indent1"><span class="nm">(b)</span><span class="cl">Question:</span> Rav used to pray Ma'ariv of Shabbos on Erev Shabbos -- would he [wait until evening to] say Kidush on a cup of wine, or not?</p>
<p class="bas indent1"><span class="nm">(c)</span><span class="cl">Answer:</span> Rav Nachman taught that one may pray Ma'ariv of Shabbos on Erev Shabbos and say Kidush over wine (before evening).</p>

<p class="bas indent1"><span class="nm">(e)</span><span class="cl">Question:</span> R. Yoshiyah used to pray Ma'ariv of Motza'i Shabbos on Shabbos -- would he say Havdalah over wine (right away, or would he wait until evening)?</p>
<p class="bas indent1"><span class="nm">(f)</span><span class="cl">Answer:</span> Rav Yehudah taught that one may pray Ma'ariv of Motza'i Shabbos on Shabbos and say Havdalah over wine.</p>
<p class="bas indent1"><span class="nm">(g)</span><span class="cl">(R. Zeira):</span> A case occurred, R. Yishmael b'Rebbi Yosi prayed Ma'ariv of Shabbos on Erev Shabbos next to this pillar.</p>
<p class="bas indent1"><span class="nm">(h)</span><span class="cl">(Ula):</span> No -- the case was, R. Elazar b'Rebbi Yosi prayed Ma'ariv of Motza'i Shabbos on Shabbos next to a date tree.</p>
<p class="bas indent1"><span class="nm">(i)</span><span class="cl">(Mishnah):</span> Ma'ariv is not Kavu'a (fixed).</p>
<p class="bas indent1"><span class="nm">(j)</span><span class="cl">Question:</span> What does this mean?</p>
<p class="bas indent2"><span class="nm">1.</span><span class="cl">Suggestion:</span> One may pray at any time during the night.</p>
<p class="bas indent2"><span class="nm">2.</span><span class="cl">Rejection:</span> If so, the Mishnah should say, "The time for Ma'ariv is the entire night"!</p>
<p class="bas indent1"><span class="nm">(k)</span><span class="cl">Answer:</span> Our Mishnah follows the opinion that Ma'ariv is Reshus (optional; Tosfos - i.e. one may perform a different Mitzvah that cannot be done later instead of praying Ma'ariv).</p>
<p class="bas indent2"><span class="nm">1.</span><span class="cl">(Rav Yehudah):</span> R. Gamliel says that Ma'ariv is Chovah (mandatory), R. Yehoshua says that it is Reshus.</p>
<p class="bas indent1"><span class="nm">(l)</span><span class="cl">(Abaye):</span> The Halachah follows the opinion that it is Chovah.</p>
<p class="bas indent1"><span class="nm">(m)</span><span class="cl">(Rava):</span> The Halachah follows the opinion that it is Reshus.</p>
<p class="bas indent1"><span class="nm">(n)</span><span class="cl">(Beraisa):</span> A case occurred, R. Yehoshua told a certain Talmid (who had asked) that Ma'ariv is Reshus; R. Gamliel answered him that it is Chovah.</p>
<p class="bas indent2"><span class="nm">1.</span><span class="cl">The Talmid:</span> But R. Yehoshua said that it is Reshus!</p>
<p class="bas indent2"><span class="nm">2.</span><span class="cl">R. Gamliel:</span> Wait until Ba'alei Trisim (Rashi - great Chachamim that wage the "war" of Halachah; Aruch - guards) enter the Beis Medrash.</p>
<p class="bas indent2"><span class="nm">3.</span>The Ba'alei Trisim entered the Beis Medrash; the Talmid asked his question, and R. Gamliel answered, "Chovah."</p>
<p class="bas indent2"><span class="nm">4.</span>R. Gamliel asked if anyone disagrees; R. Yehoshua said, "No."</p>
<p class="bas indent2"><span class="nm">5.</span><span class="cl">R. Gamliel:</span> I heard that you disagree -- stand up, they will testify about what you said!</p>

<p class="bas indent1"><span class="nm">(o)</span>R. Gamliel was sitting and expounding, R. Yehoshua was standing, everyone was murmuring; they told Chutzpis to stop (he was translating and broadcasting for R. Gamliel).</p>
<p class="bas indent1"><span class="nm">(p)</span><span class="cl">Rabanan:</span> Also before, R. Gamliel pained R. Yehoshua, in a case of establishing which day will be Rosh Hashanah, and in the episode with R. Tzadok -- this cannot continue! We must choose a different Nasi.</p>
<p class="bas indent2"><span class="nm">1.</span>We cannot appoint R. Yehoshua, for he was an involved party (this would pain R. Gamliel too much);</p>
<p class="bas indent2"><span class="nm">2.</span>We cannot appoint R. Akiva, lest he be punished (for being a cause of pain to R. Gamliel), for his ancestors (who were converts) do not have enough merits to protect him;</p>
<p class="bas indent2"><span class="nm">3.</span>Let us pick R. Elazar ben Azaryah -- he is a Chacham, wealthy, and a tenth generation descendant of Ezra.</p>
<p class="bas indent3"><span class="nm">i.</span>He is a Chacham -- he can answer questions;</p>
<p class="bas indent3"><span class="nm">ii.</span>He is wealthy -- if we must bribe the Roman ruler, he can do so;</p>
