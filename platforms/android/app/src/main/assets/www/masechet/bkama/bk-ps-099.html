<p class="bas subject"><span class="nm">1)</span>DOES A CRAFTSMAN ACQUIRE OWNERSHIP IN A <i>KLI</i> THAT HE IMPROVES?</p>
<p class="bas indent1"><span class="nm">(a)</span><span class="cl">Support (for Rav Asi - Mishnah):</span> If Reuven gave wool to a dyer, and it was ruined, he pays the value of the wool.</p>
<p class="bas indent2"><span class="nm">1.</span>He does not pay the higher value of dyed wool!</p>
<p class="bas indent2"><span class="nm">2.</span><span class="cl">Suggestion:</span> It was ruined after the wool absorbed the dye.</p>
<p class="bas indent1"><span class="nm">(b)</span><span class="cl">Rejection (Shmuel):</span> No, it was ruined the moment the wool entered. The wool was never improved.</p>
<p class="bas indent1"><span class="nm">(c)</span><span class="cl">Inference:</span> Had it become ruined after the wool absorbed the dye, he would pay for the improved wool.</p>
<p class="bas indent1"><span class="nm">(d)</span><span class="cl">Suggestion:</span> Shmuel argues with Rav Asi.</p>
<p class="bas indent1"><span class="nm">(e)</span><span class="cl">Rejection #1:</span> No. The case is, Reuven owns the wool and the dye. The dyer is paid only for his labor.</p>
<p class="bas indent1"><span class="nm">(f)</span><span class="cl">Objection:</span> If so, the dyer should pay for the wool and dye!</p>
<p class="bas indent1"><span class="nm">(g)</span><span class="cl">Rejection #2:</span> Rather, Shmuel merely shows that there is no proof from our Mishnah (but he could agree with Rav Asi).</p>
<p class="bas indent1"><span class="nm">(h)</span><span class="cl">Question (Beraisa):</span> If Reuven gave his garment to a craftsman (Levi), who finished it and informed Reuven, even if Reuven does not come for 10 days (to take and pay for it), he does not transgress keeping a worker's wages overnight;</p>
<p class="bas indent2"><span class="nm">1.</span>If Levi returned the garment during the day, if Reuven does not pay before sundown, he transgresses.</p>
<p class="bas indent2"><span class="nm">2.</span>If a craftsman acquires ownership in a Kli that he improves, why does Reuven transgress? (Levi acquired the garment, and sold it to Reuven. Reuven does not owe wages, rather, for a sale!)</p>
<p class="bas indent1"><span class="nm">(i)</span><span class="cl">Answer #1:</span> Levi only smoothes the garment. There is no improvement.</p>
<p class="bas indent1"><span class="nm">(j)</span><span class="cl">Objection:</span> If so, why did he give the garment to him?</p>
<p class="bas indent1"><span class="nm">(k)</span><span class="cl">Answer #2:</span> Rather, the worker is paid a set wage for each time he presses it. Only a Kablan (a worker contracted for an entire job) acquires ownership in a Kli that he improves.</p>
<p class="bas indent1"><span class="nm">(l)</span>Originally, we thought that he was hired for the whole job. This supports Rav Sheshes;</p>
<p class="bas indent2"><span class="nm">1.</span><span class="cl">Question:</span> If one hired a Kablan, does the transgression of keeping wages overnight apply?</p>
<p class="bas indent2"><span class="nm">2.</span><span class="cl">Answer (Rav Sheshes):</span> It applies.</p>
<p class="bas indent1"><span class="nm">(m)</span><span class="cl">Suggestion:</span> Rav Sheshes argues with Rav Asi (if a craftsman acquires ownership in a Kli that he improves, he already has his wages)!</p>
<p class="bas indent1"><span class="nm">(n)</span><span class="cl">Rejection (Shmuel bar Acha):</span> The case is, he was contracted to deliver a letter (there is no improvement to acquire).</p>
<p class="bas subject"><span class="nm">2)</span>USING IMPROVEMENTS TO A <i>KLI</i> TO MAKE <i>KIDUSHIN</i></p>
<p class="bas indent1"><span class="nm">(a)</span><span class="cl">Suggestion:</span> Tana'im argue about whether or not a craftsman acquires ownership in a Kli that he improves.</p>
<p class="bas indent2"><span class="nm">1.</span><span class="cl">(Beraisa - R. Meir):</span> If Leah told a man 'make for me bracelets and rings and I will be Mekudeshes to you', once he makes them, she is Mekudeshes;</p>
<p class="bas indent2"><span class="nm">2.</span>Chachamim say, she is not Mekudeshes until money comes to her.</p>
<p class="bas indent2"><span class="nm">3.</span><span class="cl">Question:</span> What money is this?</p>
<p class="bas indent3"><span class="nm">i.</span><span class="cl">Suggestion:</span> It is the bracelets and rings.</p>
<p class="bas indent3"><span class="nm">ii.</span><span class="cl">Rejection:</span> If so, R. Meir holds that she is Mekudeshes even without getting them. What made the Kidushin?!</p>
<p class="bas indent2"><span class="nm">4.</span><span class="cl">Answer:</span> Rather, it is additional money.</p>
<p class="bas indent2"><span class="nm">5.</span>We are currently holding that both Tana'im agree that wages are due only at the end of the job, and that Kidushin with (pardon of) a loan is invalid.</p>
<p class="bas indent3"><span class="nm">i.</span><span class="cl">Suggestion:</span> R. Meir holds that Uman Koneh bi'Shvach Kli (so giving her the jewelry is like giving his money), and Chachamim hold that Ein Uman Koneh bi'Shvach Kli.</p>
<p class="bas indent1"><span class="nm">(b)</span><span class="cl">Rejection #1:</span> No. All hold that Ein Uman Koneh bi'Shvach Kli;</p>
<p class="bas indent2"><span class="nm">1.</span>R. Meir holds that wages are due only at the end of the job (so it is as if he gives her the value of all his work when he gives her the jewelry. This makes Kidushin);</p>
<p class="bas indent2"><span class="nm">2.</span>Chachamim hold that wages accrue from the beginning of the job until the end (so she owes him for his work. Giving her the jewelry is like pardoning the debt, and this does not make Kidushin).</p>
<p class="bas indent1"><span class="nm">(c)</span><span class="cl">Rejection #2:</span> All hold that wages accrue from the beginning of the job until the end (so giving her the jewelry is like pardoning what she owes him);</p>
<p class="bas indent2"><span class="nm">1.</span>R. Meir holds that Kidushin with a loan takes effect;</p>
<p class="bas indent2"><span class="nm">2.</span>Chachamim hold that the Kidushin is void.</p>
<p class="bas bbbline">99b----------------------------------------99b</p>
<p class="bas indent1"><span class="nm">(d)</span><span class="cl">Rejection #3 (Rava):</span> All hold that wages accrue from the beginning of the job until the end, and that Kidushin with a loan is invalid, and that Ein Uman Koneh bi'Shvach Kli;</p>
<p class="bas indent2"><span class="nm">1.</span>The case is, he added material to what she gave him to make the jewelry;</p>
<p class="bas indent2"><span class="nm">2.</span>R. Meir holds that if one is Mekadesh with a loan and a Perutah, she intends to be Mekudeshes through the new money (and this works);</p>
<p class="bas indent2"><span class="nm">3.</span>Chachamim hold that she intends to be Mekudeshes through the loan (and this does not work).</p>
<p class="bas indent1"><span class="nm">(e)</span>The following Tana'im also argue about this.</p>
<p class="bas indent2"><span class="nm">1.</span><span class="cl">(Beraisa):</span> (If one was Mekadesh) 'with the wages for what I worked for you', she is not Mekudeshes. If he said 'with the wages of what I will work for you', she is Mekudeshes;</p>
<p class="bas indent2"><span class="nm">2.</span>R. Nasan says, (if he said) 'with the wages of what I will work for you', she is not Mekudeshes, and all the more so if he said 'with the wages of what I worked for you.'</p>
<p class="bas indent2"><span class="nm">3.</span>R. Yehudah ha'Nasi says, whether he said 'with the wages of what I will work for you' or 'what I worked for you', she is not Mekudeshes;</p>
<p class="bas indent3"><span class="nm">i.</span>If he added his own material, she is Mekudeshes.</p>
<p class="bas indent2"><span class="nm">4.</span>R. Nasan argues with the first Tana about wages (R. Nasan holds that wages accrue from the beginning, and the first Tana holds that wages are due only at the end);</p>
<p class="bas indent2"><span class="nm">5.</span>R. Nasan and Rebbi argue about Kidushin with a Perutah and a loan (R. Nasan holds that she intends to become Mekudeshes through the loan, and Rebbi holds that she intends for the Perutah).</p>
<p class="bas subject"><span class="nm">3)</span>IMPROPER SLAUGHTER</p>
<p class="bas indent1"><span class="nm">(a)</span><span class="cl">(Shmuel):</span> A slaughterer who slaughtered improperly is liable. He is a damager, he is negligent;</p>
<p class="bas indent2"><span class="nm">1.</span>It is as if he was told to slaughter in one place, and slaughtered elsewhere.</p>
<p class="bas indent1"><span class="nm">(b)</span><span class="cl">Question:</span> Why did Shmuel say he is a damager and he is negligent?</p>
<p class="bas indent1"><span class="nm">(c)</span><span class="cl">Answer:</span> Had he said only that he is a damager, one might have thought that that is only when he slaughtered for wages, but if he slaughtered for free, he is exempt. 'He is negligent' teaches that he is liable even if he slaughtered for free.</p>
<p class="bas indent1"><span class="nm">(d)</span><span class="cl">Question (Rav Chama bar Gurya - Beraisa):</span> If a slaughterer slaughtered improperly, if he is a professional, he is exempt. If not, he is liable;</p>
<p class="bas indent2"><span class="nm">1.</span>If he was paid, in either case he is liable.</p>
<p class="bas indent1"><span class="nm">(e)</span><span class="cl">Shmuel:</span> Your brain should be clouded (for asking such a question)!</p>
<p class="bas indent1"><span class="nm">(f)</span>One of the Rabanan asked the same question.</p>
<p class="bas indent1"><span class="nm">(g)</span><span class="cl">Shmuel:</span> You deserve what I told Rav Chama! You should have understood that my law is like R. Meir. Why do you ask from a Beraisa that is like Chachamim?!</p>
<p class="bas indent2"><span class="nm">1.</span>'He is a damager, he is negligent. It is as if he was told to slaughter in one place and slaughtered elsewhere' is like R. Meir, who says that one must watch what he does.</p>
<p class="bas indent1"><span class="nm">(h)</span><span class="cl">Question:</span> Where did R. Meir say this?</p>
<p class="bas indent1"><span class="nm">(i)</span><span class="cl">Answer #1 (Mishnah - R. Meir):</span> If the owner of an animal tied or locked in front of it properly, and it escaped and damaged, whether it is Tam or Mu'ad, he is liable.</p>
<p class="bas indent1"><span class="nm">(j)</span><span class="cl">Rejection:</span> There, R. Meir and Chachamim argue about how to expound the verses.</p>
<p class="bas indent1"><span class="nm">(k)</span><span class="cl">Answer #2 (Mishnah - R. Meir):</span> If Reuven gave wool to Shimon to dye red, and he died it black, or vice-versa, Shimon pays to him the value of the wool he received.</p>
<p class="bas indent1"><span class="nm">(l)</span><span class="cl">Rejection:</span> There, he intentionally changed from what he was told.</p>
<p class="bas indent1"><span class="nm">(m)</span><span class="cl">Answer #3 (Beraisa - R. Meir):</span> If his jug broke and he did not clear away the fragments, or his camel fell, and he did not stand it up, he is liable for damage that they caused;</p>
<p class="bas indent2"><span class="nm">1.</span>Chachamim say, Beis Din does not make him pay, but Heaven holds him accountable.</p>
<p class="bas indent2"><span class="nm">2.</span>R. Meir holds that one who trips is considered negligent. Chachamim hold that he is not.</p>
<p class="bas indent1"><span class="nm">(n)</span><span class="cl">(Rabah bar bar Chanah, citing R. Yochanan):</span> If a slaughterer slaughtered improperly, even if he is a professional like the slaughterers of Tzipori, he is liable.</p>
<p class="bas indent1"><span class="nm">(o)</span><span class="cl">Question:</span> Did R. Yochanan really say that?!</p>
<p class="bas indent2"><span class="nm">1.</span>R. Yochanan once ruled that a butcher (who improperly slaughtered a chicken) will be exempt if he can prove that he is an expert to slaughter chickens.</p>
<p class="bas indent1"><span class="nm">(p)</span><span class="cl">Answer:</span> A professional is exempt if he slaughtered for free. He is liable if he was paid.</p>
<p class="bas indent2"><span class="nm">1.</span><span class="cl">(R. Zeira):</span> If one wants the slaughterer to be liable if the slaughter will be invalid, he should pay him beforehand.</p>
<p class="bas indent1"><span class="nm">(q)</span><span class="cl">Question (Beraisa):</span> In the following cases, one is liable for substandard work, because he is like one who receives wages (even though he works for free):</p>
<p class="bas indent2"><span class="nm">1.</span>A grinder received wheat to grind, and he did not moisten it first, and he made coarse flour;</p>
<p class="bas indent2"><span class="nm">2.</span>A baker received flour to make bread, and he made bread that crumbles;</p>
<p class="bas indent2"><span class="nm">3.</span>A slaughterer did an invalid slaughter.</p>
<p class="bas indent1"><span class="nm">(r)</span><span class="cl">Answer:</span> The Beraisa means that he is liable because he (truly) receives wages.</p>
<p class="bas indent1"><span class="nm">(s)</span>A case occurred in which a man slaughtered through Hagramah (the knife left the ring (of the windpipe) during the Shechitah; Tana'im argue about whether or not this is valid). Rav ruled that the animal may not be eaten, but the slaughterer is exempt.</p>
<p class="bas indent2"><span class="nm">1.</span><span class="cl">Rav Kahana and Rav Asi (to the animal's owner):</span> Rav made two (contradictory) rulings in your case!</p>
<p class="bas indent2"><span class="nm">2.</span><span class="cl">Question:</span> What did they mean?</p>
<p class="bas indent2"><span class="nm">3.</span><span class="cl">Answer #1:</span> He made two (contradictory) rulings to your detriment:</p>
<p class="bas indent3"><span class="nm">i.</span>He should have permitted the slaughter, like R. Yosi b'Rebbi Yehudah;</p>
<p class="bas indent3"><span class="nm">ii.</span>If he forbids it like Chachamim, he should obligate the slaughterer to pay!</p>
<p class="bas indent2"><span class="nm">4.</span><span class="cl">Rejection:</span> It is forbidden to say such a thing!</p>
<p class="bas indent3"><span class="nm">i.</span><span class="cl">(Beraisa):</span> A judge may not say, 'I wanted to acquit you, but the other judges outnumbered me' - "One who goes tale-bearing reveals secrets".</p>
<p class="bas indent2"><span class="nm">5.</span><span class="cl">Answer #2:</span> Rather, he made two (contradictory) rulings to your benefit:</p>
<p class="bas indent3"><span class="nm">i.</span>He prevented you from eating a Safek Neveilah;</p>
<p class="bas indent3"><span class="nm">ii.</span>He prevented you from Safek theft (taking money from the slaughterer. Perhaps he is exempt!)</p>
