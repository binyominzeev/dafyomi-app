<p class="bas subject"><span class="nm">1)</span>TEMURAH B'MEZID</p>
<p class="bas indent1"><span class="nm">(a)</span><span class="cl">(Gemara) Question:</span> What is R. Yosi b'Rebbi Yehudah's reason?</p>
<p class="bas indent1"><span class="nm">(b)</span><span class="cl">Answer:</span> "Yihyeh Kodesh" includes Shogeg like Mezid.</p>
<p class="bas indent1"><span class="nm">(c)</span><span class="cl">Question:</span> In what case is Shogeg like Mezid?</p>
<p class="bas indent1"><span class="nm">(d)</span><span class="cl">Answer #1 (Chizkiyah):</span> He thought that it is permitted to make Temurah;</p>
<p class="bas indent2"><span class="nm">1.</span><span class="cl">Version #1:</span> He is lashed for Temurah, but he is not lashed for such a case of Hekdesh (e.g. he thought that it is permitted to be Makdish a Ba'al Mum).</p>
<p class="bas indent2"><span class="nm">2.</span><span class="cl">Version #2:</span> Temurah takes effect, but a similar case of Hekdesh (he thought that one may be Makdish a Ba'al Mum) does not take effect. (We adopt Shitah's text.)</p>
<p class="bas indent1"><span class="nm">(e)</span><span class="cl">Version #1 - Answer #2 (R. Yochanan):</span> He intended to say "Temuras Olah," and mistakenly said "Temuras Shelamim". Temurah takes effect, but such a case of Hekdesh does not take effect.</p>
<p class="bas indent1"><span class="nm">(f)</span><span class="cl">Version #2 - Answer #2 (R. Yochanan):</span> He intended to say "the black animal should be Temurah," and mistakenly said "the white animal". He is lashed for Temurah, but he is not lashed for such a case of Hekdesh (since it would not take effect).</p>
<p class="bas indent1"><span class="nm">(g)</span><span class="cl">Answer #3 (Reish Lakish):</span> He said (Bach - thought) "This animal should leave (its Kedushah, i.e. become Chulin), and this should enter (become Hekdesh in place of it)."</p>
<p class="bas indent2"><span class="nm">1.</span>Regarding Kodshim, if one ate a Ba'al Mum without Pidyon (because he believed this is permitted), he is not lashed. For Temurah, he is lashed.</p>
<p class="bas indent1"><span class="nm">(h)</span><span class="cl">Answer #4 (Rav Sheshes):</span> He said "I will enter my house, be Makdish and make Temurah"; he entered, and mistakenly made Temurah <i>before</i> Hekdesh;</p>
<p class="bas indent2"><span class="nm">1.</span>He is lashed for Temurah, but he is not lashed for Hekdesh.</p>
<p class="bas subject"><span class="nm">2)</span>PESULIM</p>
<p class="bas indent1"><span class="nm">(a)</span><span class="cl">(Mishnah - R. Eliezer):</span> The following do not become Kadosh...</p>
<p class="bas indent1"><span class="nm">(b)</span><span class="cl">(Shmuel):</span> They do not become Kadosh through Temurah, and (even if they are Kedoshim) they are not Mekadesh other animals through Temurah:</p>
<p class="bas indent1"><span class="nm">(c)</span><span class="cl">(Beraisa - R. Meir) Question:</span> Since they are not Kedoshim, how could they make Temurah?</p>
<p class="bas indent2"><span class="nm">1.</span><span class="cl">Answer:</span> The case is, he was Makdish an animal, and it became Tereifah. He was Makdish a fetus, and then it was born Yotzei Dofen.</p>
<p class="bas indent2"><span class="nm">2.</span>The only case of Kil'ayim, Tumtum and Androginus is Vlados Kodshim, according to R. Yehudah, who says that (normal) Vlados Kodshim make Temurah.</p>
<p class="bas indent1"><span class="nm">(d)</span><span class="cl">Question (Rava (Shitah's text)):</span> What is R. Eliezer's reason?</p>
<p class="bas indent1"><span class="nm">(e)</span><span class="cl">Answer #1 (Rava):</span> These Pesulim are like a Tamei (species of) Behemah. Just like a Tamei may not be offered and it cannot get Kedushas ha'Guf, also these Pesulim.</p>
<p class="bas indent1"><span class="nm">(f)</span><span class="cl">Objection (Rav Papa):</span> A Ba'al Mum may not be offered, yet it can get Kedushas ha'Guf!</p>
<p class="bas indent2"><span class="nm">1.</span><span class="cl">Answer (Rava):</span> A Ba'al Mum is different, for others of its Min (e.g. purebred males or females) may be offered (if they are Tamim)!</p>
<p class="bas indent2"><span class="nm">2.</span><span class="cl">Objection (Rav Papa):</span> Tereifah does not get Kedushas ha'Guf, even though others of its Min may be offered (if they are healthy)!</p>
<p class="bas indent1"><span class="nm">(g)</span><span class="cl">Answer #2 (Rava):</span> Rather, they are like a Tamei Behemah, which may not be offered because it is intrinsically Pasul. A Ba'al Mum is not intrinsically Pasul, it is just lacking.</p>
<p class="bas indent1"><span class="nm">(h)</span><span class="cl">Objection (Rav Ada):</span> The Torah lists "Saru'a (a pair of limbs are different sizes) v'Kalut (uncloven hooves)" among Mumim, even though nothing is lacking!</p>
<p class="bas indent1"><span class="nm">(i)</span><span class="cl">Answer #3 (Rava):</span> Rather, they are like a Tamei Behemah. Nothing of its Min (species) may be offered. A Ba'al Mum may not be offered, but others of its Min (Tamim) may be offered!</p>
<p class="bas indent2"><span class="nm">1.</span><span class="cl">Suggestion:</span> The same should apply to Tereifah, for others of its kind (Kesherim) may be offered!</p>
<p class="bas indent2"><span class="nm">2.</span><span class="cl">Rejection:</span> A Ba'al Mum is unlike a Tereifah. A Tereifah may not be eaten, like a Tamei, but a Ba'al Mum may be eaten.</p>
<p class="bas indent1"><span class="nm">(j)</span><span class="cl">(Shmuel):</span> If one was Makdish a Tereifah, it may not be redeemed until it gets a Mum.</p>
<p class="bas indent1"><span class="nm">(k)</span><span class="cl">Question:</span> (Yisraelim may not eat Terefos.) This redemption is in order to feed it to dogs! (The Halachah forbids this)!</p>
<p class="bas indent1"><span class="nm">(l)</span><span class="cl">Correction:</span> Rather, if one was Makdish a Tereifah, it becomes Kodesh (and cannot be redeemed). It must die.</p>
<p class="bas indent1"><span class="nm">(m)</span><span class="cl">(R. Oshaya):</span> This is like Hekdesh of wood and rocks (Kedushas Damim, it may be redeemed for any purpose). (Rashi switches the order of the next two questions.)</p>
<p class="bas indent1"><span class="nm">(n)</span><span class="cl">Question (Mishnah):</span> If any Kodshim became Tereifah, it may not be redeemed, for we may not redeem Kodshim to feed to dogs.</p>
<p class="bas indent2"><span class="nm">1.</span><span class="cl">Inference:</span> It may not be redeemed because it became Tereifah after it was Kodesh. However, if it was Tereifah before it was Kodesh, we may redeem it. (This is like R. Oshaya. It refutes Shmuel!)</p>
<p class="bas indent1"><span class="nm">(o)</span><span class="cl">Answer:</span> This Tana holds that something that may not be offered does not get Kedushas ha'Guf (like R. Eliezer. Shmuel holds like Chachamim, who argue).</p>
<p class="bas indent1"><span class="nm">(p)</span><span class="cl">Question (Mishnah - R. Eliezer):</span> The following do not become Kadosh and are not Mekadesh others - Tereifah, Kil'ayim, Yotzei Dofen, Tumtum and Androginus.</p>
<p class="bas indent2"><span class="nm">1.</span><span class="cl">(Shmuel):</span> They do not become Kadosh through Temurah, and (even if they are Kedoshim) they are not Mekadesh other animals through Temurah:</p>
<p class="bas indent2"><span class="nm">2.</span><span class="cl">(Beraisa - R. Meir) Question:</span> Since they are not Kedoshim, how could they make Temurah?</p>
<p class="bas indent2"><span class="nm">3.</span><span class="cl">Answer:</span> The case is, he was Makdish an animal, and then it became Tereifah. He was Makdish a fetus, and then it was born Yotzei Dofen.</p>
<p class="bas indent2"><span class="nm">4.</span><span class="cl">Inference:</span> If it was Tereifah before he was Makdish it, it would not get Kedushas ha'Guf!</p>
<p class="bas bbbline">17b----------------------------------------17b</p>
<p class="bas indent1"><span class="nm">(q)</span><span class="cl">Answer:</span> R. Eliezer (and R. Meir) hold(s) that something that may not be offered does not get Kedushas ha'Guf. Shmuel holds like Chachamim.</p>
<p class="perekline">PEREK ELU KODSHIM</p>
<p class="bas subject"><span class="nm">3)</span>VLADOS AND TEMUROS OF KODSHIM</p>
<p class="bas indent1"><span class="nm">(a)</span><span class="cl">(Mishnah):</span> Vlados and Temuros of the following Kodshim (in this and subsequent Mishnayos) are like the Kodshim themselves:</p>
<p class="bas indent2"><span class="nm">1.</span>Vlad or Temurah of Shelamim, and their Vlados, and their Vlados for all generations are like Shelamim;</p>
<p class="bas indent2"><span class="nm">2.</span>They require Semichah, Nesachim, and Tenufah of Chazeh v'Shok.</p>
<p class="bas indent1"><span class="nm">(b)</span><span class="cl">(Gemara) Question:</span> Since it taught Vlados and Vladei Vlados (we understand that the same applies to all generations), why must it say "for all generations"?</p>
<p class="bas indent1"><span class="nm">(c)</span><span class="cl">Answer:</span> Our Tana heard R. Eliezer say (like he says in the next Mishnah) that Vlad Shelamim may not be offered for a Shelamim. Our Tana countered that not only the Vlados are like Shelamim, rather, even Vladei Vlados for all generations are like Shelamim.</p>
<p class="bas indent1"><span class="nm">(d)</span><span class="cl">Question:</span> What is the source of this?</p>
<p class="bas indent1"><span class="nm">(e)</span><span class="cl">Answer #1 (Beraisa #1):</span> (Shelamim can be a) "Zachar" includes Vlad Shelamim (it is like Shelamim);</p>
<p class="bas indent2"><span class="nm">1.</span><span class="cl">Question:</span> A Kal va'Chomer should teach this! Temuras Shelamim is like Shelamim, even though it was not Kadosh from its inception. Vlad Shelamim was Kadosh from its inception, all the more so it should be like Shelamim!</p>
<p class="bas indent2"><span class="nm">2.</span><span class="cl">Answer:</span> We cannot learn from Temurah, for it applies to all Korbanos (Yachid), unlike Vlados (which do not apply to Korbanos that are only males, e.g. Olah). Therefore, we need "Zachar."</p>
<p class="bas indent2"><span class="nm">3.</span>"Nekevah" includes Temuras Shelamim (it is like Shelamim).</p>
<p class="bas indent2"><span class="nm">4.</span><span class="cl">Question:</span> Perhaps we include only Vlad and Temurah of a Tam. What is the source to include Vlad and Temurah of a Ba'al Mum?</p>
<p class="bas indent2"><span class="nm">5.</span><span class="cl">Answer:</span> "<i>Im</i> Zachar" includes Vlad Ba'al Mum. "<i>Im</i> Nekevah" includes Temuras Ba'al Mum.</p>
<p class="bas indent2"><span class="nm">6.</span><span class="cl">Question (Rav Safra):</span> Why don't we learn oppositely?</p>
<p class="bas indent2"><span class="nm">7.</span><span class="cl">Answer (Abaye):</span> Since "Zachar" taught Vlad Tam, it is more reasonable that "<i>Im</i> Zachar" includes Vlad Ba'al Mum, and "<i>Im</i> Nekevah" teaches about Temurah, which is learned from "Nekevah."</p>
<p class="bas indent2"><span class="nm">8.</span><span class="cl">Clarification (Rav Safra):</span> I meant, why don't we learn Temuras Shelamim from "Zachar," and Vlad Shelamim from "Nekevah"?</p>
<p class="bas indent2"><span class="nm">9.</span><span class="cl">Answer (Abaye):</span> The word "Vlad" is masculine, so it is more reasonable to learn it from "Zachar". Temurah is feminine, so we learn it from "Nekevah."</p>
<p class="bas indent2"><span class="nm">10.</span><span class="cl">Question:</span> In what sense are Vlados of a Ba'al Mum Kodesh?</p>
<p class="bas indent2"><span class="nm">11.</span><span class="cl">Answer #1 (Shmuel and Rava):</span> They may be offered, according to R. Eliezer (18b, who says that the Vlad of (a female Hukdash for) an Olah is offered for an Olah);</p>
<p class="bas indent3"><span class="nm">i.</span>One might have thought that Vlad Olah is offered, for Shem Olah Al Imo (Rashi - female Olos (ha'Of) can be offered; Tosfos - the mother cannot be redeemed until it gets a Mum), but not Vlad Ba'al Mum (for a Ba'al Mum is never offered, or because it may be redeemed immediately). The Beraisa teaches that even Vlad Ba'al Mum is offered.</p>
<p class="bas indent2"><span class="nm">12.</span><span class="cl">Answer #2 (Bar Pada and Rav Papa):</span> All agree that it gets (Rashi - at least enough) Kedushah to necessitate that it is Ro'eh.</p>
<p class="bas indent1"><span class="nm">(f)</span><span class="cl">Answer #2 (Beraisa - R. Yishmael):</span> "Rak Kodoshecha" refers to Temuros. "Asher Yihyu Lecha" refers to Vlados (Kodshim) (these must be brought to Yerushalayim);</p>
<p class="bas indent2"><span class="nm">1.</span><span class="cl">Suggestion:</span> Perhaps "Tisa u'Vasa" teaches that one must bring them to the Beis ha'Mikdash and let them starve to death!</p>
<p class="bas indent2"><span class="nm">2.</span><span class="cl">Rejection:</span> "V'Asisa Olosecha ha'Basar veha'Dam" commands to treat Temuras Olah like Olah (offer it), and to treat Vlad and Temuras Shelamim like Shelamim.</p>
<p class="bas indent2"><span class="nm">3.</span><span class="cl">Suggestion:</span> Perhaps this applies to (Rashi - Temuros and) (Vlados of) all Korbanos!</p>
<p class="bas indent2"><span class="nm">4.</span><span class="cl">Rejection:</span> It says "Rak".</p>
<p class="bas indent2"><span class="nm">5.</span>R. Akiva says, we need not learn from there. "Asham Hu" teaches that it is offered, but its Temurah is not offered.</p>
<p class="bas indent1"><span class="nm">(g)</span><span class="cl">Question:</span> The Beraisa suggested that "Tisa u'Vasa" teaches that one must bring them to the Beis ha'Mikdash and starve them to death? Why would we think so?</p>
<p class="bas indent2"><span class="nm">1.</span>Since tradition teaches that five Chata'os must die, we infer that everything else may be offered!</p>
<p class="bas indent1"><span class="nm">(h)</span><span class="cl">Answer:</span> One might have thought that five Chata'os may die anywhere, but these (Temurah and Vlados) must die in the Beis ha'Mikdash.</p>
