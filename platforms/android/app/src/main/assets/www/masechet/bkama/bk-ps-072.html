<div class="indent1"><span class="nm">(b)</span><p><span class="cl">Answer:</span> "And he slaughtered it" connotes (that it was forbidden to slaughter) all of it. This is only in the father's lifetime;</p></div>
<div class="indent1"><span class="nm">(c)</span><p><span class="cl">(Mishnah):</span> If the animal was found to be Tereifah... (or he slaughtered Chulin ba'Azarah), he pays four or five).</p></div>

<div class="indent2"><span class="nm">1.</span><p>If the entire act of slaughter were considered slaughter, the animal would be Asur b'Hana'ah from the start of slaughter (in the Mikdash). For the rest of the slaughter, the animal did not belong to the original owner!</p></div>
<div class="indent1"><span class="nm">(e)</span><p><span class="cl">Objection #1 (Rav Huna brei d'Rava):</span> He is liable for the very beginning of the slaughter!</p></div>

<div class="indent1"><span class="nm">(a)</span><p><span class="cl">(Mishnah):</span> If two witnesses testified that Reuven stole and slaughtered or sold; and they were Huzmu (found to be Zomemim, i.e. they were not present to see the testimony that they gave), they pay the full fine (four or five).</p></div>
<div class="indent1"><span class="nm">(b)</span><p>If two witnesses testified that Reuven stole, and two others testified that he slaughtered or sold, and both pairs were Huzmu, the first pair pays Kefel for the animal, and the second pair pays the remaining (two or) three;</p></div>

<div class="indent1"><span class="nm">(c)</span><p><span class="cl">Version #1:</span> Rava disqualifies from now and onwards, because the law of Edim Zomemim is a Chidush (exception):</p></div>

<div class="indent2"><span class="nm">2.</span><p>The Torah's Chidush is that in this trial (and surely, for future testimonies) we say that the first pair are liars. We have no source to consider them liars before this!</p></div>

<div class="indent2"><span class="nm">1.</span><p>Chachamim enacted that he is disqualified from now and onwards to prevent a loss to buyers (who used these witnesses to sign their documents of purchase).</p></div>
