<p class="bas indent1"><span class="nm">(a)</span><span class="cl">Question:</span> Why is he liable in the Reisha (for slaughter in his father's lifetime) and exempt in the Seifa (for slaughter after his father died)?</p>
<p class="bas indent1"><span class="nm">(b)</span><span class="cl">Answer:</span> "And he slaughtered it" connotes (that it was forbidden to slaughter) all of it. This is only in the father's lifetime;</p>
<p class="bas indent1"><span class="nm">(c)</span><span class="cl">(Mishnah):</span> If the animal was found to be Tereifah... (or he slaughtered Chulin ba'Azarah), he pays four or five).</p>
<p class="bas indent1"><span class="nm">(d)</span><span class="cl">Version #1 Inference (R. Chavivi of Chuzna'ah):</span> Only the completion of slaughter is considered slaughter;</p>
<p class="bas indent2"><span class="nm">1.</span>If the entire act of slaughter were considered slaughter, the animal would be Asur b'Hana'ah from the start of slaughter (in the Mikdash). For the rest of the slaughter, the animal did not belong to the original owner!</p>
<p class="bas indent1"><span class="nm">(e)</span><span class="cl">Objection #1 (Rav Huna brei d'Rava):</span> He is liable for the very beginning of the slaughter!</p>
<p class="bas indent1"><span class="nm">(f)</span><span class="cl">Defense (Rav Ashi):</span> This cannot be. "And he slaughtered it" connotes the entire slaughter.</p>
<p class="bas indent1"><span class="nm">(g)</span><span class="cl">Objection #2 (Rav Gamda):</span> He is liable when he started the slaughter outside the Mikdash, and completed it in the Mikdash.</p>
<p class="bas indent1"><span class="nm">(h)</span>Version #2 (Reish Lakish) Only the completion of slaughter is considered slaughter;</p>

<p class="bas indent2"><span class="nm">1.</span>If he forbade mid'Oraisa, how could he explain why our Mishnah obligates? The animal is forbidden from the start of slaughter. For the rest of the slaughter, the animal did not belong to the original owner!</p>
<p class="bas indent1"><span class="nm">(k)</span><span class="cl">Objection #1 (R. Acha brei d'Rava):</span> He is liable for the beginning of the slaughter.</p>

<p class="bas subject"><span class="nm">2)</span>LIABILITY OF <i>EDIM</i> <i>ZOMEMIM</i></p>
<p class="bas indent1"><span class="nm">(a)</span><span class="cl">(Mishnah):</span> If two witnesses testified that Reuven stole and slaughtered; and they were Huzmu (found to be Zomemim, i.e. they were not present to see the testimony that they gave), they pay the full fine (four or five).</p>
<p class="bas indent1"><span class="nm">(b)</span>If two witnesses testified that Reuven stole, and two others testified that he slaughtered, and both pairs were Huzmu, the first pair pays Kefel for the animal, the second pair pays the remaining (two or) three;</p>
<p class="bas indent2"><span class="nm">1.</span>If only the second pair was Huzam, Reuven pays Kefel, and the second pair pays (two or) three;</p>
<p class="bas indent2"><span class="nm">2.</span>If only one witness was Huzam, if he is from the second pair, the testimony about the slaughter is void;</p>
<p class="bas indent2"><span class="nm">3.</span>If he is from the first pair, the entire testimony is void. If he did not steal the animal, he may slaughter it!</p>
<p class="bas subject"><span class="nm">3)</span>FROM WHEN ARE <i>ZOMEMIM</i> WITNESSES DISQUALIFIED?</p>
<p class="bas indent1"><span class="nm">(a)</span><span class="cl">(Abaye):</span> If Shimon testified and was Huzam, all testimony that he gave or will give after his fabricated testimony are invalid;</p>
<p class="bas indent1"><span class="nm">(b)</span><span class="cl">(Rava):</span> Only testimony he gives after he was Huzam is invalid.</p>
<p class="bas indent2"><span class="nm">1.</span>Abaye disqualifies him retroactively. He is a Rasha from when he testified, and it says "do not put... a Rasha (to be a) witness";</p>
<p class="bas indent1"><span class="nm">(c)</span><span class="cl">Version #1:</span> Rava disqualifies from now and onwards, because the law of Edim Zomemim is a Chidush (exception):</p>
<p class="bas indent2"><span class="nm">1.</span>Why should we believe the latter witnesses (Mazimim), who say that the first pair are Zomemim? Perhaps the latter pair are lying!</p>
<p class="bas indent2"><span class="nm">2.</span>The Torah's Chidush is that in this trial (and surely, for future testimonies) we say that the first pair are liars. We have no source to consider them liars before this!</p>
<p class="bas indent1"><span class="nm">(d)</span><span class="cl">Version #2:</span> Rava agrees that the Torah disqualifies him retroactively;</p>
<p class="bas indent2"><span class="nm">1.</span>Chachamim enacted that he is disqualified from now and onwards to prevent a loss to buyers (who used these witnesses to sign their documents of purchase).</p>
