<p class="bas subject"><span class="nm">1)</span>GUARDING A SECURITY (cont.)</p>
<p class="bas indent1"><span class="nm">(a)</span><span class="cl">Rejection #2:</span> In the Mishnah, Reuven lent Peros; in the Beraisa, he lent money.</p>
<p class="bas indent1"><span class="nm">(b)</span><span class="cl">Question (Seifa - R. Yehudah):</span> If he lent to him money, he is a Shomer Chinam, If he lent to him Peros, he is a Shomer Sachar.</p>
<p class="bas indent2"><span class="nm">1.</span><span class="cl">Inference:</span> The first Tana does not distinguish between lending Peros and money!</p>
<p class="bas indent1"><span class="nm">(c)</span><span class="cl">Answer:</span> The entire Mishnah is R. Yehudah. It is abbreviated, and it means as follows:</p>
<p class="bas indent2"><span class="nm">1.</span>If Reuven lent to Shimon Al ha'Mashkon, he is a Shomer Sachar;</p>
<p class="bas indent2"><span class="nm">2.</span>This is if he lent Peros. If he lent to him money, he is a Shomer Chinam, for R. Yehudah says that if he lent to him money, he is a Shomer Chinam, and if he lent to him Peros, he is a Shomer Sachar.</p>
<p class="bas indent1"><span class="nm">(d)</span><span class="cl">Objection:</span> If so, the Mishnah is unlike R. Akiva!</p>
<p class="bas indent1"><span class="nm">(e)</span><span class="cl">Answer:</span> Indeed, we must say that the Mishnah is unlike R. Eliezer. (We assume that an anonymous Mishnah is R. Meir, and is like his Rebbi, R. Akiva.)</p>
<p class="bas subject"><span class="nm">2)</span>THE ARGUMENT OF R. ELIEZER AND R. AKIVA</p>
<p class="bas indent1"><span class="nm">(a)</span><span class="cl">Suggestion:</span> R. Eliezer and R. Akiva argue about Shmuel's law, when the security is worth less than the loan.</p>
<p class="bas indent2"><span class="nm">1.</span><span class="cl">(Shmuel):</span> If Reuven lent 1000 Zuz and took an axe handle for a security, if he loses the handle, he loses the whole loan. (R. Akiva holds like Shmuel. R. Eliezer argues, for the security was taken only for a reminder of the loan.)</p>
<p class="bas indent1"><span class="nm">(b)</span><span class="cl">Rejection:</span> All disagree with Shmuel's law. If the security is worth less than the loan, all agree that he can still collect (according to R. Akiva, he deducts the value of the security);</p>
<p class="bas indent1"><span class="nm">(c)</span>Rather, they argue about R. Yitzchak's law, when the security is worth the amount of the loan.</p>
<p class="bas indent2"><span class="nm">1.</span><span class="cl">(R. Yitzchak):</span> A lender acquires a security. We learn from "u'Lecha Tihyeh Tzedakah";</p>
<p class="bas indent3"><span class="nm">i.</span>If he did not acquire it, returning it would not be called Tzedakah (since it belongs to the borrower. Some explain, the only reason "u'Veracheka" (the borrower may bless the lender, this is not Ribis of words) is because the lender acquires the security and lends it to the borrower. One may receive rental for loans of objects.)</p>
<p class="bas indent1"><span class="nm">(d)</span><span class="cl">Rejection:</span> R. Yitzchak said so only about a security taken after the loan (which the verse discusses), but not about a security taken at the time of the loan!</p>
<p class="bas indent1"><span class="nm">(e)</span>Rather, R. Eliezer and R. Akiva agree to R. Yitzchak's law. They argue about a security taken at the time of the loan, like the argument about a Shomer Aveidah (one who found a lost object, and guards it in order to return it).</p>
<p class="bas indent2"><span class="nm">1.</span><span class="cl">(Rabah):</span> A Shomer Aveidah is a Shomer Chinam;</p>
<p class="bas indent2"><span class="nm">2.</span><span class="cl">(Rav Yosef):</span> He is a Shomer Sachar (because guarding the Aveidah is a Mitzvah).</p>
<p class="bas indent2"><span class="nm">3.</span>(Rashi - Rabah must hold like R. Eliezer. He cannot explain R. Akiva's opinion. Tosfos -  Rabah can say that R. Eliezer and R. Akiva both hold like him, and argue about Shmuel's law.)</p>
<p class="bas indent1"><span class="nm">(f)</span><span class="cl">Suggestion:</span> Rav Yosef must admit that R. Eliezer and R. Akiva argue about his law (R. Akiva agrees to it, R. Eliezer argues with it).</p>
<p class="bas indent1"><span class="nm">(g)</span><span class="cl">Rejection:</span> No, all can agree to his law;</p>
<p class="bas bbbline">82b----------------------------------------82b</p>
<p class="bas indent2"><span class="nm">1.</span>They argue when the lender needs the security (Rashi - to use it; Tosfos - he would not lend without a security):</p>
<p class="bas indent3"><span class="nm">i.</span>R. Akiva says that even so the loan to be a Mitzvah, therefore he is a Shomer Sachar;</p>
<p class="bas indent3"><span class="nm">ii.</span>R. Eliezer does not consider it to be a Mitzvah, so he is a Shomer Chinam.</p>
<p class="bas indent1"><span class="nm">(h)</span><span class="cl">(Mishnah - Aba Sha'ul):</span> A lender may rent out an Ani's security and deduct the money from the loan.</p>
<p class="bas indent1"><span class="nm">(i)</span><span class="cl">(Rav Chanan bar Ami):</span> The Halachah follows Aba Sha'ul.</p>
<p class="bas indent2"><span class="nm">1.</span>Aba Sha'ul permits renting out only a security like a hoe or axe, which yields a sizeable rental fee and yet does not depreciate significantly due to usage.</p>
<p class="bas subject"><span class="nm">3)</span>TRANSPORTING A BARREL</p>
<p class="bas indent1"><span class="nm">(a)</span><span class="cl">(Mishnah):</span> If Reuven was transporting a barrel, and broke it, whether he was a Shomer Chinam or a Shomer Sachar, he swears (that he was not negligent, and he is exempt);</p>
<p class="bas indent1"><span class="nm">(b)</span><span class="cl">R. Elazar:</span> I heard that in either case he is exempt. It is a wonder!</p>
<p class="bas indent1"><span class="nm">(c)</span><span class="cl">(Gemara - Beraisa - R. Meir):</span> If Reuven was transporting a barrel, and broke it, whether he was a Shomer Chinam or a Shomer Sachar, he swears;</p>
<p class="bas indent1"><span class="nm">(d)</span>R. Yehudah says, a Shomer Chinam swears. A Shomer Sachar must pay.</p>
<p class="bas indent1"><span class="nm">(e)</span><span class="cl">(Mishnah - R. Elazar):</span> I heard that both are exempt. It is a wonder!</p>
<p class="bas indent1"><span class="nm">(f)</span><span class="cl">Question:</span> Does R. Meir really hold that tripping is not considered negligence?!</p>
<p class="bas indent2"><span class="nm">1.</span><span class="cl">Contradiction (Beraisa - R. Meir):</span> If Shimon's jug broke or his camel fell and he did not clear them from the Reshus ha'Rabim, he is liable for damage that results;</p>
<p class="bas indent2"><span class="nm">2.</span>Chachamim say, Beis Din does not make him pay, but he is liable b'Yedei Shamayim.</p>
<p class="bas indent2"><span class="nm">3.</span>We hold that they argue about whether or not tripping is considered negligence!</p>
<p class="bas indent1"><span class="nm">(g)</span><span class="cl">Answer #1 (R. Elazar (the Amora)):</span> Tana'im argue about R. Meir's opinion;</p>
<p class="bas indent1"><span class="nm">(h)</span>R. Yehudah holds that tripping is not considered negligence. Therefore, a Shomer Chinam is exempt. A Shomer Sachar pays even if he was not negligent.</p>
<p class="bas indent1"><span class="nm">(i)</span>R. Elazar (the Tana) heard that the Halachah follows R. Meir, but he did not understand why.</p>
<p class="bas indent2"><span class="nm">1.</span>Granted, tripping is not considered negligence, so a Shomer Chinam can swear. However, a Shomer Sachar pays even if he was not negligent!</p>
<p class="bas indent2"><span class="nm">2.</span>Even regarding a Shomer Chinam, if he fell on an incline, this is Ones, but if he fell on level ground, this is negligence!</p>
