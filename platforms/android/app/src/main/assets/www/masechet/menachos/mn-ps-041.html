<div class="indent1"><span class="nm">(a)</span><p><span class="cl">(R. Zeira citing Shmuel):</span> Kilayim does not apply to Tzitzis, even if the garment is exempt.</p></div>
<div class="indent1"><span class="nm">(b)</span><p><span class="cl">Question:</span> What is the meaning of 'even if the garment is exempt'?</p></div>
<div class="indent2"><span class="nm">1.</span><p><span class="cl">Suggestion:</span> The garment is too small to require Tzitzis.</p></div>
<div class="indent2"><span class="nm">2.</span><p><span class="cl">Rejection (Beraisa):</span> If a garment is big enough to cover the head and majority of a child (who is old enough to go in the market by himself), and big enough for an adult to wear on occasions, it requires Tzitzis;</p></div>
<div class="indent3"><span class="nm">i.</span><p>If it is not big enough to cover the head and majority of a child, even if it is big enough for an adult to wear on occasions, it is exempt from Tzitzis;</p></div>
<div class="indent3"><span class="nm">ii.</span><p>The same applies to Kilayim.</p></div>
<div class="indent2"><span class="nm">3.</span><p><span class="cl">Question:</span> What is the meaning of 'the same applies to Kilayim'?</p></div>
<div class="indent3"><span class="nm">i.</span><p><span class="cl">Suggestion:</span> Also the Isur of Kilayim does not apply to a garment too small for a child.</p></div>
<div class="indent3"><span class="nm">ii.</span><p><span class="cl">Rejection (Mishnah):</span> The Isur of Kilayim does not depend on whether one would wear the garment on occasions.</p></div>
<div class="indent2"><span class="nm">4.</span><p><span class="cl">Answer (Rav Nachman bar Yitzchak):</span> The same applies to a Sadin with Techeles. (If it is too small, there is no Mitzvah, and it is forbidden due to Kilayim). (This concludes the rejection of Suggestion (1).)</p></div>
<div class="indent1"><span class="nm">(c)</span><p><span class="cl">Answer:</span> Kilayim does not apply even if one attached Tzitzis to a garment that already had Kosher Tzitzis.</p></div>
<div class="indent1"><span class="nm">(d)</span><p><span class="cl">Question:</span> If one does not transgress in this case, surely such Tzitzis are Kosher. If so, why did R. Zeira teach the same law differently (40b, 1:k)?</p></div>
<div class="indent1"><span class="nm">(e)</span><p><span class="cl">Answer:</span> Indeed, he said only one of these (Tosfos - this law, in the name of Shmuel; Rashi - that law). The other was inferred from the one he said.</p></div>
<div class="indent1"><span class="nm">(f)</span><p><span class="cl">(Beraisa):</span> If a garment is folded over, it requires Tzitzis (on the current corners, i.e. two are on the fold);</p></div>
<div class="indent1"><span class="nm">(g)</span><p>R. Shimon exempts.</p></div>
<div class="indent2"><span class="nm">1.</span><p>All agree that if it was sewn shut, it is obligated.</p></div>
<div class="indent2"><span class="nm">2.</span><p><span class="cl">Objection:</span> This is obvious!</p></div>
<div class="indent2"><span class="nm">3.</span><p><span class="cl">Answer:</span> The case is, it was fastened only with a pin (alternatively - it was sewn poorly with wide stitches).</p></div>
<div class="indent1"><span class="nm">(h)</span><p>Rabah bar Rav Huna saw that Rava bar Rav Nachman was wearing a folded garment. It had Tzitzis on the fold. He unfolded it. (Two of) the Tzitzis were now in the middle.</p></div>
<div class="indent2"><span class="nm">1.</span><p><span class="cl">Rabah:</span> The Torah requires Tzitzis on the corner. They are not there!</p></div>
<div class="indent2"><span class="nm">2.</span><p>Rava took off the garment.</p></div>
<div class="indent2"><span class="nm">3.</span><p><span class="cl">Rabah:</span> Do you think that Tzitzis is a Chovas Adam (it is obligatory only when one wears the garment)?! No, it is Chovas Talis (one must put Tzitzis on every garment he owns (and sometimes wears)). Go put Tzitzis on the corner!</p></div>
<div class="indent1"><span class="nm">(i)</span><p><span class="cl">Support (for Rabah - Beraisa):</span> Tzadikim of old would put Tzitzis once they had woven the three fingers of the garment. (Rashba - if it were Chovas Adam, it would be a stringency to put Tzitzis on once it was finished, before wearing it. They would not be so exceedingly stringent to do so before it was finished!)</p></div>
<div class="indent1"><span class="nm">(j)</span><p><span class="cl">Rejection:</span> They were exceedingly stringent.</p></div>
<div class="indent1"><span class="nm">(k)</span><p>Rabah argues with an angel;</p></div>
<div class="indent2"><span class="nm">1.</span><p>Rav Ketina was wearing a Sadin. (Chachamim decreed not to put Tzitzis on it. Some explain that it had Lavan, but not Techeles.)</p></div>
<div class="indent2"><span class="nm">2.</span><p><span class="cl">An angel:</span> You wear a Sadin in summer, and a rounded (two-cornered) coat in winter. You never fulfill the Mitzvah of Techeles (some texts - Tzitzis)!</p></div>
<div class="indent2"><span class="nm">3.</span><p><span class="cl">Rav Ketina:</span> Do you punish for not fulfilling an (optional) Mitzvas Aseh?!</p></div>
<div class="indent2"><span class="nm">4.</span><p><span class="cl">The angel:</span> When Hash-m is angry, we do!</p></div>
<div class="indent2"><span class="nm">5.</span><p>Granted, if Tzitzis is a Chovas Adam, Rav Ketina was liable for not wearing Tzitzis. However, if it is a Chovas Talis, he is blameless!</p></div>
<div class="indent1"><span class="nm">(l)</span><p><span class="cl">Objection:</span> Even if Tzitzis is a Chovas Adam, one is not liable unless he is wearing a garment that is obligated!</p></div>
<div class="indent1"><span class="nm">(m)</span><p><span class="cl">Answer:</span> In any case, one (Nimukei Yosef - a great person) should not seek ways to avoid the Mitzvah. (Tosfos - this applies only if it is Chovas Adam. Rashi - this even applies to Chovas Talis. We cannot infer the angel's opinion.)</p></div>
<div class="indent1"><span class="nm">(n)</span><p><span class="cl">(Shmuel):</span> Garments (that one will wear) require Tzitzis, even when they are in a box.</p></div>
<div class="indent2"><span class="nm">1.</span><p>Shmuel agrees that a garment prepared for shrouds is exempt (Nimukei Yosef - even though he occasionally wears it in his lifetime).</p></div>
<div class="indent2"><span class="nm">2.</span><p>When he dies, we put Tzitzis on the shrouds, to avoid mocking him (that he is exempt from Mitzvos) - "Lo'eg la'Rash Cheref Osehu".</p></div>
<div class="subject"><span class="nm">2)</span><p>TRANSFERRING TZITZIS TO ANOTHER GARMENT</p></div>
<div class="indent1"><span class="nm">(a)</span><p><span class="cl">(Rachbah):</span> If a garment was torn more than three fingers from the corner, we may fix it (and the Tzitzis are Kosher);</p></div>
<div class="indent2"><span class="nm">1.</span><p>If it tore within three fingers of the corner, we may not fix it. (Rashi - perhaps some of the strings used to fix it will be left hanging on the corner for the sake of Tzitzis, and they are Pasul, for they were not attached l'Shem Tzitzis. Tosfos (40b DH Shema) - once it tore, all the Tzitzis are disqualified. They must be removed and reattached after fixing it. Rosh - we may never put Tzitzis on, even after fixing the corner.)</p></div>
<div class="indent1"><span class="nm">(b)</span><p><span class="cl">Support (Beraisa):</span> If a garment was torn more than three fingers from the corner, we may fix it;</p></div>
<div class="indent2"><span class="nm">1.</span><p>R. Meir says, if it tore within three fingers, we may not fix it; (Hagahos Maimoni - this supports Rachbah, for the Halachah follows R. Meir's decrees. Nimukei Yosef switches the opinions of R. Meir and Chachamim; the support is from Chachamim.)</p></div>
<div class="indent2"><span class="nm">2.</span><p>Chachamim permit fixing it.</p></div>
<div class="indent2"><span class="nm">3.</span><p>All agree that one may not bring even a large piece of material (with Techeles on it) from another garment and attach it;</p></div>
<div class="indent2"><span class="nm">4.</span><p>All agree that one may bring Techeles strings (taken from another garment) and attach them, on condition that they were not cut.</p></div>

<div class="indent2"><span class="nm">6.</span><p><span class="cl">Rejection:</span> Perhaps they may be removed only from a worn-out garment.</p></div>
<div class="indent1"><span class="nm">(c)</span><p><span class="cl">(Beraisa #1):</span> If a garment is entirely Techeles, strings of any color fulfill the Mitzvah of Lavan, except for Kala Ilan.</p></div>
<div class="indent1"><span class="nm">(d)</span><p><span class="cl">Contradiction (Beraisa #2):</span> Lavan strings must be of the same color (Rashi; Tosfos - material, unless they are wool or linen) as the garment;</p></div>
<div class="indent2"><span class="nm">1.</span><p>If a garment is entirely Techeles, one attaches Techeles strings and a different color for Lavan. He should not use Kala Ilan;</p></div>
<div class="indent2"><span class="nm">2.</span><p>If he used Kala Ilan, he fulfilled the Mitzvah.</p></div>
<div class="indent1"><span class="nm">(e)</span><p><span class="cl">Version #1 - Resolution (Rav Nachman bar Yitzchak):</span> Beraisa #2 discusses a garment with four strings. (All the strings are needed, so we are not concerned lest one transfer them to another garment);</p></div>
<div class="indent2"><span class="nm">1.</span><p>Beraisa #1 discusses a garment with eight strings (on each corner, four Techeles and four Kala Ilan. Chachamim decreed to disqualify Kala Ilan, lest someone buy the garment and think that all the strings are Techeles, and transfer some to another garment. One of the garments will have Kala Ilan in place of Techeles).</p></div>
<div class="indent1"><span class="nm">(f)</span><p><span class="cl">Version #2 - Resolution (Rav Nachman bar Yitzchak):</span> Beraisa #2 refers to a garment with eight strings. (Each corner has two Techeles strings and two Lavan (or some other color that does not resemble Techeles), and four Kala Ilan are added. L'Chatchilah this is forbidden, lest the Kala Ilan be transferred and used in place of Techeles);</p></div>
<div class="indent2"><span class="nm">1.</span><p>Beraisa #1 refers to a garment with four strings (on each corner, two Techeles and two Kala Ilan. To fulfill Techeles and Lavan, the strings must be of recognizably different colors.) (end of Version #2)</p></div>
<div class="indent1"><span class="nm">(g)</span><p><span class="cl">Inference:</span> Since such a decree was made, this teaches that one may remove Tzitzis from a garment to attach them to another garment!</p></div>
<div class="indent1"><span class="nm">(h)</span><p><span class="cl">Rejection:</span> Perhaps it is forbidden. Chachamim decreed lest people (improperly) do so.</p></div>
<div class="indent1"><span class="nm">(i)</span><p><span class="cl">(Rav):</span> One may not remove Tzitzis from a garment to attach them to another garment.</p></div>
<div class="indent1"><span class="nm">(j)</span><p><span class="cl">(Shmuel):</span> It is permitted.</p></div>
<div class="indent1"><span class="nm">(k)</span><p><span class="cl">(Rav):</span> One may not light one Ner Chanukah from another. (This looks like a disgrace of the Mitzvah);</p></div>
<div class="indent1"><span class="nm">(l)</span><p><span class="cl">(Shmuel):</span> It is permitted.</p></div>
<div class="indent1"><span class="nm">(m)</span><p><span class="cl">(Rav):</span> The Halachah does not follow R. Shimon (one may not drag something on a dirt floor on Shabbos if it might make a furrow. This is like plowing);</p></div>
<div class="indent1"><span class="nm">(n)</span><p><span class="cl">(Shmuel):</span> The Halachah follows R. Shimon. (It is permitted.)</p></div>
<div class="indent1"><span class="nm">(o)</span><p><span class="cl">(Abaye):</span> Wherever Rav and Shmuel argue, my Rebbi (Rabah) always followed (Tosfos Shabbos - the stringencies of) Rav, except for the above three places.</p></div>
<div class="indent2"><span class="nm">1.</span><p><span class="cl">(Beraisa - R. Shimon):</span> One may drag a bed, chair or bench on a dirt floor, as long as one does not intend to make a furrow.</p></div>
<div class="indent1"><span class="nm">(p)</span><p>Rav Yehudah would give his garment (with Techeles) to a launderer.

<div class="indent1"><span class="nm">(q)</span><p>Rav Chanina would fold the Techeles strings together (R. Gershom - wrap them in other strings) to protect them (when giving the garment to a launderer);</p></div>
