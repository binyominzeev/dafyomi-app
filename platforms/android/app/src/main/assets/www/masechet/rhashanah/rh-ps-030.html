<p class="bas subject"><span class="nm">1)</span>SHOFAR IN THE PRESENCE OF <i>BEIS DIN</i></p>
<p class="bas indent1"><span class="nm">(a)</span><span class="cl">(R. Huna):</span> (Referring to the opinion in the Mishnah that the Shofar was blown on Shabbos not only in Yavneh, but also in every place where there as a Beis Din) The Shofar was blown with Beis Din - i.e. in their presence.</p>
<p class="bas indent1"><span class="nm">(b)</span><span class="cl">Question (Rava):</span> We see otherwise:</p>
<p class="bas indent2"><span class="nm">1.</span>The Mishnah states that there was an "additional" advantage of Yerushalayim over Yavneh - additional to what?</p>
<p class="bas indent2"><span class="nm">2.</span>It could mean that in Yerushalayim, individuals would blow Shofar, whereas in Yavneh, only the Shali'ach Beis Din would blow Shofar.</p>
<p class="bas indent2"><span class="nm">3.</span>But R. Yitzchak bar Yosef testified that in Yavneh, everyone would blow Shofar!</p>
<p class="bas indent2"><span class="nm">4.</span>So it must mean that whereas in Yavneh the Shofar could only be blown when Beis Din was in session, in Yerushalayim the Shofar could be blown at any time.</p>
<p class="bas indent2"><span class="nm">5.</span>But nevertheless in Yavneh the Shofar could be blown while Beis Din was in session - even if it was not in their presence!?</p>
<p class="bas indent1"><span class="nm">(c)</span><span class="cl">Answer:</span> It is additional to the advantage that in Yavneh, the Shofar was only blown in the presence of Beis Din.</p>
<p class="bas subject"><span class="nm">2)</span>SHOFAR DURING THE TIME OF <i>BEIS DIN'S </i>SESSION</p>
<p class="bas indent1"><span class="nm">(a)</span>Some attribute R. Huna's statement to a different context:</p>
<p class="bas indent1"><span class="nm">(b)</span>The Pasuk teaches us that every individual must blow Shofar.</p>
<p class="bas indent1"><span class="nm">(c)</span><span class="cl">(R. Huna):</span> The Shofar was blown with Beis Din - i.e. during the time of their session.</p>
<p class="bas indent1"><span class="nm">(d)</span><span class="cl">Question (Rava):</span> We see otherwise:</p>
<p class="bas indent2"><span class="nm">1.</span>The Shofar must be blown on Shabbos Yom Kipur of Yovel by "Ish u'Veiso."</p>
<p class="bas indent2"><span class="nm">2.</span>"Ish u'Veiso" can't mean man and wife, as women are not obligated in a time-related Mitzvos Aseh!</p>
<p class="bas indent2"><span class="nm">3.</span>So it must mean "Ish b'Veiso" - in his house, i.e. even not during the time of Beis Din's session!?</p>
<p class="bas indent1"><span class="nm">(e)</span><span class="cl">Answer:</span> No, it must still be during the time of Beis Din's session.</p>
<p class="bas indent1"><span class="nm">(f)</span><span class="cl">Question (R. Sheshes):</span> We see otherwise:</p>
<p class="bas indent2"><span class="nm">1.</span>Yovel is equal to Rosh Hashanah regarding Shofar except that with Yovel, every Beis Din blows Shofar and even individuals, whereas with Rosh Hashanah only Beis Din that sanctified the month would blow Shofar, and individuals are not obligated.</p>
<p class="bas indent2"><span class="nm">2.</span>What does it mean by "individuals are not obligated"?</p>
<p class="bas indent2"><span class="nm">3.</span>It can't mean that individuals do not blow Shofar, as there was testimony from Yavneh that they do!</p>
<p class="bas indent2"><span class="nm">4.</span>So it must mean that on Rosh Hashanah they would blow only when they were in session, whereas on Yovel, they would blow Shofar even when Beis Din was not in session!?</p>
<p class="bas indent1"><span class="nm">(g)</span><span class="cl">Answer:</span> No, it means that on Yovel they would blow Shofar even not in the presence of Beis Din, but still only during the time when they were in session.</p>
<p class="bas indent2"><span class="nm">1.</span>This rule is confirmed by another source.</p>
<p class="bas indent1"><span class="nm">(h)</span><span class="cl">Question (R. Zeira):</span> If Beis Din have closed court and are ready to leave, is that still considered the time of Beis Din's session?</p>
<p class="bas indent1"><span class="nm">(i)</span>Teyku.</p>
<p class="bas subject"><span class="nm">3)</span>THE VICINITY OF YERUSHALAYIM</p>
<p class="bas indent1"><span class="nm">(a)</span>The Mishnah said that all towns within sight and hearing of Yerushalayim, close and able to come, would also blow Shofar on Shabbos.</p>
<p class="bas indent1"><span class="nm">(b)</span>"Within sight" excludes those towns that are in valleys.</p>
<p class="bas indent1"><span class="nm">(c)</span>"Within hearing" excludes those towns that are on hilltops.</p>
<p class="bas indent1"><span class="nm">(d)</span>"Close" excludes those beyond the Techum.</p>
<p class="bas indent1"><span class="nm">(e)</span>"Able to come" excludes those separated by a river.</p>
<p class="bas subject"><span class="nm">4)</span><i>MISHNAH:</i> LULAV</p>
<p class="bas indent1"><span class="nm">(a)</span>Originally, Lulav was taken for seven days in the Beis ha'Mikdash, and on one day elsewhere.</p>
<p class="bas indent1"><span class="nm">(b)</span>After the Destruction, R. Yochanan ben Zakai decreed that it should be taken for seven days everywhere, to commemorate the Beis ha'Mikdash.</p>
<p class="bas indent1"><span class="nm">(c)</span>He also forbade the eating of Chadash on the sixteenth of Nisan.</p>
<p class="bas subject"><span class="nm">5)</span>COMMEMORATING THE <i>BEIS HA'MIKDASH</i></p>
<p class="bas indent1"><span class="nm">(a)</span><span class="cl">Question:</span> How do we know that there is a need for a commemoration?</p>
<p class="bas indent1"><span class="nm">(b)</span><span class="cl">Answer:</span> The Pasuk states that someone has to care about Tziyon.</p>
<p class="bas subject"><span class="nm">6)</span>THE EATING OF CHADASH</p>
<p class="bas indent1"><span class="nm">(a)</span><span class="cl">Question:</span> Why was eating of Chadash on the sixteenth of Nisan forbidden?</p>
<p class="bas indent1"><span class="nm">(b)</span><span class="cl">Answer:</span> When the Beis ha'Mikdash will be rebuilt, people will say that just as they ate last year on the morning of the sixteenth, so too they can eat this year (without realizing that when there is a Beis ha'Mikdash, Chadash remains forbidden until the Omer has been brought.</p>
<p class="bas indent1"><span class="nm">(c)</span><span class="cl">Question:</span> When are we concerned about the Beis ha'Mikdash being rebuilt?</p>
<p class="bas indent2"><span class="nm">1.</span>It can't be on the sixteenth of Nisan - because there would be no problem, as Chadash would indeed become permitted from the morning of the sixteenth!</p>
<p class="bas indent2"><span class="nm">2.</span>It can't be on the fifteenth of Nisan - as it would be permitted from after midday, for we have learned that those who come from afar are allowed to eat it then, as it is presumed that the Omer has already been brought!</p>
<p class="bas indent1"><span class="nm">(d)</span><span class="cl">Answer:</span> It is referring to where it is rebuilt on the afternoon or evening of the fifteenth, when there won't be time to bring the Omer.</p>
<p class="bas bbbline">30b----------------------------------------30b</p>
<p class="bas indent1"><span class="nm">(e)</span><span class="cl">(R. Nachman bar Yitzchak):</span> R. Yochanan ben Zakai's decree was based on R. Yehudah's principle:</p>
<p class="bas indent2"><span class="nm">1.</span><span class="cl">(R. Yehudah):</span> The Pasuk forbids eating Chadash until the sixteenth.</p>
<p class="bas indent2"><span class="nm">2.</span>"Until" is inclusive - i.e. the entire day of the sixteenth is forbidden.</p>
<p class="bas indent1"><span class="nm">(f)</span><span class="cl">Question:</span> Surely we find that they argue as to whether it is forbidden d'Oraisa or d'Rabanan!?</p>
<p class="bas indent1"><span class="nm">(g)</span><span class="cl">Answer:</span> R. Yehudah mistakenly understood R. Yochanan ben Zakai to have meant d'Rabanan.</p>
<p class="bas indent2"><span class="nm">1.</span><span class="cl">Question:</span> But R. Yochanan ben Zakai used the term "decreed," implying d'Rabanan?</p>
<p class="bas indent2"><span class="nm">2.</span><span class="cl">Answer:</span> It means that, based on the Pasuk, he decreed it.</p>
<p class="bas subject"><span class="nm">7)</span><i>MISHNAH:</i> THE TIMES FOR ACCEPTING TESTIMONY</p>
<p class="bas indent1"><span class="nm">(a)</span>Originally, testimony about the new moon would be accepted all day.</p>
<p class="bas indent1"><span class="nm">(b)</span>Once, the witnesses were delayed, and the Levi'im made a mistake with the Shir.</p>
<p class="bas indent1"><span class="nm">(c)</span>It was thereafter decreed that witnesses would only be accepted until Minchah.</p>
<p class="bas indent1"><span class="nm">(d)</span>If they come afterwards, both that day and the next day are observed as Rosh Chodesh.</p>
<p class="bas indent1"><span class="nm">(e)</span>After the Destruction, R. Yochanan ben Zakai decreed that testimony could be accepted all day.</p>
<p class="bas subject"><span class="nm">8)</span>THE MISTAKE WITH THE <i>SHIR</i></p>
<p class="bas indent1"><span class="nm">(a)</span><span class="cl">Question:</span> What was the mistake with the Shir?</p>
<p class="bas indent1"><span class="nm">(b)</span><span class="cl">Answer (from Bavel):</span> They didn't sing at all.</p>
<p class="bas indent1"><span class="nm">(c)</span><span class="cl">Alternate answer (R. Zeira):</span> They sang the weekday Shir with the Tamid (instead of the festival Shir).</p>
<p class="bas indent1"><span class="nm">(d)</span><span class="cl">Question:</span> R. Zeira quoted a Beraisa that 'They instituted not to receive the witnesses after Minchah, in order that there should be sufficient time in the day to bring the Temidin, the Musafin and the drink-offerings without mishap.' Doesn't 'without mishap' imply that it was to avoid singing the wrong Shir?</p>
<p class="bas indent1"><span class="nm">(e)</span><span class="cl">Answer:</span> Not singing it at all is the biggest mishap of all.</p>
<p class="bas indent1"><span class="nm">(f)</span><span class="cl">Question (R. Acha bar Huna):</span> We see that they sang the Shir of the wrong day:</p>
<p class="bas indent2"><span class="nm">1.</span>On the morning of the thirtieth of Elul - the Levi'im would generally sing the regular Shir of whichever day it was.</p>
<p class="bas indent2"><span class="nm">2.</span>... at Musaf, if that day was declared Rosh Hashanah - "Harninu" (The Shir shel Yom for Thursday).</p>
<p class="bas indent2"><span class="nm">3.</span>... at Shachris, if the witnesses came before the Tamid shel Shachar, and it was a Thursday morning - "Hasirosi" (the second half of "Harninu"). This is in order to avoid repeating the same Shir twice on the same day, where it could be avoided.</p>
<p class="bas indent2"><span class="nm">4.</span>... at Musaf, in the same case, if the witnesses came <i>after</i> the Tamid shel Shachar - "Harninu" (even though it meant repeating it - because it was unavoidable).</p>
<p class="bas indent2"><span class="nm">5.</span>We see here that, in cases of doubt, they would sing the weekday Shir, and that was why it was a case of repeating it!?</p>
<p class="bas indent1"><span class="nm">(g)</span><span class="cl">Answer:</span> In that case, they sang the Shir because it was suited to that day anyway.</p>
