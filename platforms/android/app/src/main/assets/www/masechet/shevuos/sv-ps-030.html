<p class="bas subject"><span class="nm">1)</span>WOMEN CANNOT TESTIFY</p>
<p class="bas indent1"><span class="nm">(a)</span><span class="cl">(Mishnah - R. Meir):</span> Shevu'as ha'Edus applies to men, but not to women; to strangers, but not to relatives; to Kosher witnesses, but not to invalid witnesses, and only to people proper to testify;</p>
<p class="bas indent1"><span class="nm">(b)</span>When he swears himself, he is liable in or outside of Beis Din; if the oath is imposed on him, he is liable only if he denies in Beis Din.</p>
<p class="bas indent1"><span class="nm">(c)</span>Chachamim say, whether he swears himself or the oath is imposed on him, he is liable only if he denies in Beis Din.</p>
<p class="bas indent1"><span class="nm">(d)</span>One is liable for swearing falsely b'Mezid (he really remembers the testimony), whether or not he knows the punishment for it;</p>
<p class="bas indent2"><span class="nm">1.</span>He is exempt if he did not remember the testimony.</p>
<p class="bas indent1"><span class="nm">(e)</span>When he is liable, he brings a Korban Oleh v'Yored.</p>
<p class="bas indent1"><span class="nm">(f)</span><span class="cl">(Gemara) Question:</span> What is the source (that the oath does not apply to women, because they are invalid witnesses)?</p>
<p class="bas indent1"><span class="nm">(g)</span><span class="cl">Answer #1 (Beraisa #1):</span> "V'Omdu Shnei ha'Anashim" refers to the witnesses.</p>
<p class="bas indent2"><span class="nm">1.</span><span class="cl">Question:</span> Perhaps it refers to the parties in the case (the claimant and defendant)!</p>
<p class="bas indent2"><span class="nm">2.</span><span class="cl">Answer #1:</span> "Asher Lahem ha'Riv" refers to them, so "v'Omdu Shnei ha'Anashim" must refer to witnesses.</p>
<p class="bas indent2"><span class="nm">3.</span><span class="cl">Answer #2:</span> If you prefer, you can learn from "(Al Pi) <i>Shnei</i> (Edim)", which refers to witnesses.</p>
<p class="bas indent3"><span class="nm">i.</span><span class="cl">Question:</span> What objection might one have to the first answer (to prefer a different source)?</p>
<p class="bas indent3"><span class="nm">ii.</span><span class="cl">Answer:</span> If 'Shnei ha'Anashim' refers to witnesses, it should have said '<i>va</i>'Asher Lahem ha'Riv.' ("<i>Asher</i> Lahem ha'Riv" connotes the ones just mentioned, i.e. the whole verse refers to the parties.)</p>
<p class="bas indent1"><span class="nm">(h)</span><span class="cl">Answer #2 (Beraisa #2):</span> "V'Omdu Shnei ha'Anashim" refers to the witnesses.</p>
<p class="bas indent2"><span class="nm">1.</span><span class="cl">Question:</span> Perhaps it refers to the parties!</p>
<p class="bas indent2"><span class="nm">2.</span><span class="cl">Answer #1:</span> If so, the Torah would not say "two", for the parties could be comprised of many people (but normally, only two witnesses testify).</p>
<p class="bas indent2"><span class="nm">3.</span><span class="cl">Answer #2:</span> If you prefer, you can learn from "Shnei", which refers to witnesses.</p>
<p class="bas indent3"><span class="nm">i.</span><span class="cl">Question:</span> What objection might one have to the first answer?</p>
<p class="bas indent3"><span class="nm">ii.</span><span class="cl">Answer:</span> 'Shnei ha'Anashim' could mean the two parties, even if each party is composed of several people.</p>
<p class="bas indent1"><span class="nm">(i)</span><span class="cl">Answer #3 (Beraisa #3):</span> "V'Omdu Shnei ha'Anashim" refers to the witnesses.</p>
<p class="bas indent2"><span class="nm">1.</span><span class="cl">Question:</span> Perhaps it rather refers to the parties in the case!</p>
<p class="bas indent2"><span class="nm">2.</span><span class="cl">Answer #1:</span> The Torah would not say "men", for also women need to come for judgment!</p>
<p class="bas indent2"><span class="nm">3.</span><span class="cl">Answer #2:</span> If you prefer, you can learn from "Shnei."</p>
<p class="bas indent3"><span class="nm">i.</span><span class="cl">Question:</span> What objection might one have to the first answer?</p>
<p class="bas indent3"><span class="nm">ii.</span><span class="cl">Answer:</span> Women do not normally come to Beis Din for judgment (rather, they send a man to plead their case) - "Kol Kevudah Vas Melech Penimah."</p>
<p class="bas subject"><span class="nm">2)</span>NOT FAVORING ONE PARTY IN COURT</p>
<p class="bas indent1"><span class="nm">(a)</span><span class="cl">(Beraisa):</span> "V'Omdu Shnei ha'Anashim" - the parties must stand;</p>
<p class="bas indent1"><span class="nm">(b)</span>R. Yehudah says, the judges may choose to have them sit;</p>
<p class="bas indent2"><span class="nm">1.</span>One may not make one party stand while the other party sits.</p>
<p class="bas indent1"><span class="nm">(c)</span><span class="cl">(Beraisa):</span> "B'Tzedek Tishpot Amisecha" - the judge cannot make one party stand while the other party sits, or allow only one party to speak as long as it wants;</p>
<p class="bas indent1"><span class="nm">(d)</span><span class="cl">Alternatively:</span> the verse commands everyone to judge his fellowman favorably (when he sees him do something that might be wrong).</p>
<p class="bas indent2"><span class="nm">1.</span><span class="cl">(Rav Yosef):</span> "B'Tzedek Tishpot <i>Amisecha</i>" - one who acts like one of your nation, i.e. he observes Torah and Mitzvos, you must judge very well.</p>
<p class="bas indent1"><span class="nm">(e)</span>Ula brei r'Rav Ila'i had to go for judgment in front of Rav Nachman. Rav Yosef sent to Rav Nachman 'Ula is our colleague in Torah and Mitzvos.'</p>
<p class="bas indent2"><span class="nm">1.</span><span class="cl">Rav Nachman:</span> Surely, Rav Yosef did not intend for flattery (to tilt the verdict)!</p>
<p class="bas indent3"><span class="nm">i.</span>Rather, he informed me, so I will know to judge his case before that of an ignoramus.</p>
<p class="bas bbbline">30b----------------------------------------30b</p>
<p class="bas indent3"><span class="nm">ii.</span>Alternatively, it is so I will be inclined to pick him if the verdict is Shuda (Rashi - if we cannot prove to which of two people Ploni gave something, the judge estimates whom Ploni preferred; Tosfos - the judge gives the disputed property to whomever he himself prefers).</p>
<p class="bas indent1"><span class="nm">(f)</span><span class="cl">(Ula):</span> R. Yehudah and Chachamim argue only about the parties, but all agree that the witnesses must stand - "v'Omdu Shnei ha'Anashim."</p>
<p class="bas indent1"><span class="nm">(g)</span><span class="cl">(Rav Huna):</span> They argue only about the time of deliberations. All agree that when the final verdict is given, the judges must sit and the parties stand;</p>
<p class="bas indent2"><span class="nm">1.</span><span class="cl">Version #1:</span> We learn from "va'Yeshev Moshe... va'Ya'amod ha'Am."</p>
<p class="bas indent2"><span class="nm">2.</span><span class="cl">Version #2:</span> We learn from witnesses. Their testimony is like the final verdict (they do not do anything after this) and they must stand - "v'Omdu Shnei ha'Anashim."</p>
<p class="bas indent1"><span class="nm">(h)</span>Rav Huna's widow came for judgment in front of Rav Nachman. He was thinking what he should do.</p>
<p class="bas indent2"><span class="nm">1.</span>If I stand to honor her, her opponent will be taken aback and unable to plead his case;</p>
<p class="bas indent2"><span class="nm">2.</span>I cannot sit (while she stands). A Chacham's wife is like a Chacham (and Rav Huna was greater than me)!</p>
<p class="bas indent2"><span class="nm">3.</span>He told his servant 'make a goose flutter upon me', so it would seem that Rav Nachman rises due to the goose.</p>
<p class="bas indent2"><span class="nm">4.</span><span class="cl">Question:</span> The judge must sit and the parties must stand at the time of the final verdict!</p>
<p class="bas indent2"><span class="nm">5.</span><span class="cl">Answer:</span> He sat half-way, like one untying his shoe, and said 'Ploni is liable, Almoni is exempt.'</p>
<p class="bas indent1"><span class="nm">(i)</span><span class="cl">(Rabah bar Rav Huna):</span> If a Chacham and ignoramus have a case with each other, we tell the Chacham to sit, and also the ignoramus;</p>
<p class="bas indent2"><span class="nm">1.</span>If the ignoramus wants to stand, we do not insist that he sit.</p>
<p class="bas indent1"><span class="nm">(j)</span>Rav Papa was judging Rav bar Sharbiya. He seated him, and told his opponent (Reuven) to sit. A messenger of the Beis Din kicked Reuven so he would stand. Rav Papa kept quiet.</p>
<p class="bas indent1"><span class="nm">(k)</span><span class="cl">Question:</span> Reuven will be confounded, and unable to claim!</p>
<p class="bas indent1"><span class="nm">(l)</span><span class="cl">Answer (Rav Papa):</span> No. He saw that I seated him. He realizes that only the messenger is upset with him.</p>
<p class="bas indent1"><span class="nm">(m)</span><span class="cl">(Rabah bar Rav Huna):</span> If a Chacham and ignoramus (Shimon) have a case with each other, the Chacham may not come in front of the judge before Shimon, lest Shimon suspect that the Chacham was pleading his case;</p>
<p class="bas indent2"><span class="nm">1.</span>If the Chacham normally learns with the judge at this time, it is permitted. Shimon will assume they were learning.</p>
<p class="bas indent1"><span class="nm">(n)</span><span class="cl">(Rabah bar Rav Huna):</span> If a witness is a greater Chacham than the judges, and it is a disgrace for him to go to testify in front of them, he should not go.</p>
<p class="bas indent1"><span class="nm">(o)</span><span class="cl">Support (Rav Shisha brei d'Rav Idi - Mishnah):</span> If one finds a bag or box (in a situation where the Mitzvah of returning a lost object applies), if it is below his dignity to carry it (he would not take it if it was his own), he is exempt.</p>
<p class="bas indent2"><span class="nm">1.</span>Rabah's law applies only to monetary cases, but if the testimony will prevent people from transgressing, "Ein Chachmah v'Ein Tevunah v'Ein Etzah l'Neged Hash-m" - we do not honor a Chacham if it will cause Chilul Hash-m (transgressions).</p>
<p class="bas indent1"><span class="nm">(p)</span>Rav Yeimar knew testimony for Mar Zutra. Ameimar told everyone to sit.</p>
<p class="bas indent1"><span class="nm">(q)</span><span class="cl">Question (Rav Ashi):</span> Ula taught that R. Yehudah and Chachamim argue only regarding the parties, but all agree that the witnesses must stand!</p>
<p class="bas indent1"><span class="nm">(r)</span><span class="cl">Answer (Ameimar):</span> It is a Mitzvas Aseh for the witnesses to stand, and an Aseh to honor Chachamim;</p>
<p class="bas indent2"><span class="nm">1.</span>The Aseh to honor Chachamim takes precedence.</p>
<p class="bas subject"><span class="nm">3)</span>DISTANCING ONE'S SELF FROM FALSEHOOD</p>
<p class="bas indent1"><span class="nm">(a)</span><span class="cl">(Beraisa):</span> We learn the following laws from "mi'Devar Sheker Tirchak":</p>
<p class="bas indent2"><span class="nm">1.</span>A judge may not strive to defend his ruling if he believes that he erred;</p>
<p class="bas indent2"><span class="nm">2.</span>A judge may not deliberate the case with an unlearned Talmid (lest this lead the judge to err);</p>
<p class="bas indent2"><span class="nm">3.</span>A judge may not sit on a Beis Din with a judge whom he knows is a thief;</p>
<p class="bas indent2"><span class="nm">4.</span>A witness may not give testimony with a witness whom he knows is a thief (even if the testimony is true, testimony of a thief is invalid);</p>
<p class="bas indent2"><span class="nm">5.</span>If a judge knows that the testimony is false, he may not rule based on it (and let the witnesses bear the blame).</p>
