<div class="subject"><span class="nm">1)</span><p>THE ATTRIBUTES OF LIVING IN <i>ERETZ</i> <i>YISRAEL</i> (cont.)</p></div>
<div class="indent1"><span class="nm">(a)</span><p>R. Zeira wanted to go to Eretz Yisrael, so he was avoiding Rav Yehudah (his Rebbi).</p></div>
<div class="indent2"><span class="nm">1.</span><p><span class="cl">(Rav Yehudah):</span> Anyone who goes from Bavel to Eretz Yisrael transgresses an Aseh - "They will be brought to Bavel, and there they will be until I redeem them".</p></div>
<div class="indent1"><span class="nm">(b)</span><p>R. Zeira explains that the verse discusses the Kelim of the Mikdash.</p></div>
<div class="indent1"><span class="nm">(c)</span><p>Rav Yehudah holds that another verse forbids people to return - "I put an oath upon you, daughters of Yerushalayim, with deer or wild goats".</p></div>
<div class="indent1"><span class="nm">(d)</span><p>R. Zeira holds that this oath forbids Yisrael to return together, by force.</p></div>
<div class="indent1"><span class="nm">(e)</span><p>Rav Yehudah derives another oath from another verse, to forbid an individual to return.</p></div>
<div class="indent1"><span class="nm">(f)</span><p>R. Zeira learns that verse like R. Yosi b'Rebbi Chanina:</p></div>
<div class="indent2"><span class="nm">1.</span><p><span class="cl">(R. Yosi b'Rebbi Chanina):</span> The verses recount three oaths Hash-m imposed: Yisrael should not return together, by force; Yisrael should not rebel against the other nations; and the nations should not subjugate Yisrael too harshly.</p></div>
<div class="indent1"><span class="nm">(g)</span><p><span class="cl">Rav Yehudah:</span> "If you will awaken, if you will arouse" shows that there were more oaths!</p></div>
<div class="indent1"><span class="nm">(h)</span><p>R. Zeira learns the additional oaths like R. Levi:</p></div>
<div class="indent2"><span class="nm">1.</span><p><span class="cl">(R. Levi):</span> The three additional oaths forbid us to reveal the time to redemption, to push off the redemption (alternatively - to demand redemption too strongly), and to reveal the secret (of the calculation of leap years and months, or of the reasons for Mitzvos) to the nations.</p></div>
<div class="indent1"><span class="nm">(i)</span><p><span class="cl">(R. Elazar):</span> "With deer or wild goats" - if we do not keep the oaths, Hash-m will make our flesh prey for others, like flesh of deer or wild goats.</p></div>
<div class="indent1"><span class="nm">(j)</span><p><span class="cl">(R. Elazar):</span> Anyone who lives in Eretz Yisrael dwells without sin - "the neighbors should not say that I struck the inhabitants, whose sin is borne".</p></div>
<div class="indent2"><span class="nm">1.</span><p><span class="cl">(Rava):</span> We learned that the verse refers to those who suffer intestinal sicknesses.</p></div>
<div class="indent1"><span class="nm">(k)</span><p><span class="cl">(Rav Anan):</span> If one is buried in Eretz Yisrael, it is as if he is buried under the Mizbe'ach.</p></div>
<div class="indent2"><span class="nm">1.</span><p>It says "A Mizbe'ach of earth", and it says "Its earth atones for its people."</p></div>
<div class="indent1"><span class="nm">(l)</span><p>Ula frequently came to Eretz Yisrael. He died in Chutz la'Aretz.</p></div>
<div class="indent2"><span class="nm">1.</span><p>R. Elazar lamented "On Tamei ground you will die"!</p></div>
<div class="indent2"><span class="nm">2.</span><p><span class="cl">Bearers of the news:</span> His coffin is coming for burial here.</p></div>
<div class="indent2"><span class="nm">3.</span><p><span class="cl">(R. Elazar):</span> This is not the same as dying here.</p></div>
<div class="indent1"><span class="nm">(m)</span><p>A Yavam asked if he should go to Chutz la'Aretz to do Yibum.</p></div>
<div class="indent2"><span class="nm">1.</span><p><span class="cl">R. Chanina:</span> His brother died for marrying a Nochris (i.e. a resident of Chutz la'Aretz), blessed be Hash-m, Who killed him for that. Will the Yavam do the same?!</p></div>
<div class="indent1"><span class="nm">(n)</span><p><span class="cl">(Rav Yehudah citing Shmuel):</span> Just like it is forbidden to go from Eretz Yisrael to Bavel, it is forbidden to go from Bavel (which has Yeshivos that spread Torah) to other lands.</p></div>
<div class="indent2"><span class="nm">1.</span><p><span class="cl">(Rabah and Rav Yosef):</span> One may not even go from Pumbedisa (Rav Yehudah, Rabah, Rav Yosef, Abaye and Rava were successive Roshei Yeshiva there) to Bei Kuvi.</p></div>
<div class="indent2"><span class="nm">2.</span><p>A man went from Pumbedisa to Bei Kuvi, and Rav Yosef excommunicated him.</p></div>
<div class="indent2"><span class="nm">3.</span><p>A man went from Pumbedisa to Astonya, and he died.</p></div>
<div class="indent2"><span class="nm">4.</span><p><span class="cl">Abaye:</span> Had this Chacham wanted to live, he could have lived (by staying in Pumbedisa)!</p></div>
<div class="indent1"><span class="nm">(o)</span><p><span class="cl">(Rabah and Rav Yosef):</span> Eretz Yisrael absorbs the best of Bavel; Bavel absorbs the best of other lands.</p></div>
<div class="indent1"><span class="nm">(p)</span><p><span class="cl">Question:</span> To what does this refer?</p></div>
<div class="indent2"><span class="nm">1.</span><p><span class="cl">Suggestion:</span> It refers to lineage.</p></div>
<div class="indent2"><span class="nm">2.</span><p><span class="cl">Rejection:</span> It was taught that we consider people of other lands to be of doubtful lineage relative to Eretz Yisrael, and Eretz Yisrael has doubtful lineage compared to Bavel! (Ezra took all people of bad lineage with him to Eretz Yisrael.)</p></div>
<div class="indent1"><span class="nm">(q)</span><p><span class="cl">Answer:</span> Rather, it refers to burial.</p></div>
<div class="indent1"><span class="nm">(r)</span><p><span class="cl">(Rav Yehudah):</span> One who dwells in Bavel is as if he dwells in Eretz Yisrael - "Take refuge in Tziyon, dwellers of Bavel".</p></div>
<div class="indent1"><span class="nm">(s)</span><p><span class="cl">(Abaye):</span> We have a tradition that Bavel will not see the birthpangs of Mashi'ach. This refers to Hutzal of Binyamin.</p></div>
<div class="indent2"><span class="nm">1.</span><p>Then it will be called "The horn of salvation."</p></div>
<div class="subject"><span class="nm">2)</span><p>REVIVAL OF THE DEAD IN CHUTZ LA'ARETZ</p></div>
<div class="indent1"><span class="nm">(a)</span><p><span class="cl">(R. Elazar):</span> The dead in Chutz la'Aretz will not live - "I will put Tzvi (glory) in the land of the living." The dead will live only in the land in which is Tzivyoni (My desire).</p></div>
<div class="indent1"><span class="nm">(b)</span><p><span class="cl">Question (R. Aba bar Mamal - Beraisa):</span> "Your dead will live" refers to those who die in Eretz Yisrael. "the Mesim of My nation will rise" are those who die in Chutz la'Aretz;</p></div>
<div class="indent2"><span class="nm">1.</span><p>"I will put Tzvi in the land of the living" refers to Nevuchadnetzar, a king as fast as a deer, who was sent to ravage Eretz Yisrael!</p></div>
<div class="indent1"><span class="nm">(c)</span><p><span class="cl">Answer (R. Elazar):</span> Another verse supports me - "He gives a soul to the nation on it (Eretz Yisrael) and spirit to those who walk in it";</p></div>
<div class="indent2"><span class="nm">1.</span><p>"The Mesim of My nation" refers to stillborn babies (of Eretz Yisrael).</p></div>
<div class="indent1"><span class="nm">(d)</span><p>R. Aba explains "He gives a soul to the nation on it" like R. Avahu:</p></div>
<div class="indent2"><span class="nm">1.</span><p><span class="cl">(R. Avahu):</span> Even a Kena'ani slave in Eretz Yisrael is guaranteed a share in the world to come.</p></div>
<div class="indent2"><span class="nm">2.</span><p>It says "He gives a soul l'Am (to the nation) on it", and it says "Wait here Im (with) the donkey" - we read 'Im' like 'Am', a nation that resembles a donkey.</p></div>
<div class="indent1"><span class="nm">(e)</span><p><span class="cl">(R. Yirmiyah bar Aba):</span> "And spirit to those who walk in it" - anyone who walks four Amos in Eretz Yisrael is guaranteed a share in the world to come.</p></div>
<div class="indent1"><span class="nm">(f)</span><p><span class="cl">Question:</span> Does R. Elazar really hold that the dead outside of Eretz Yisrael will not live?!</p></div>
<div class="indent1"><span class="nm">(g)</span><p><span class="cl">Answer (R. Ila):</span> Their bones roll to Eretz Yisrael, and come to life in Eretz Yisrael.</p></div>
<div class="indent1"><span class="nm">(h)</span><p><span class="cl">Question (R. Aba Sala Rava):</span> Surely, Tzadikim should not endure such pain!</p></div>
<div class="indent1"><span class="nm">(i)</span><p><span class="cl">Answer (Abaye):</span> Underground tunnels are made for Tzadikim.</p></div>
<div class="indent1"><span class="nm">(j)</span><p><span class="cl">Question (Karna):</span> Yakov Avinu knew that he was a total Tzadik. If the dead of Chutz la'Aretz live, why did he trouble his children to bury him in Eretz Yisrael?</p></div>
<div class="indent1"><span class="nm">(k)</span><p><span class="cl">Answer:</span> He was concerned lest he not merit tunnels.</p></div>
<div class="indent2"><span class="nm">1.</span><p>R. Chanina asked similarly about Yosef ha'Tzadik, and gave the same answer.</p></div>
<div class="indent1"><span class="nm">(l)</span><p>Rabah's brothers sent Karna's teaching to Rabah, to try to persuade him to come to Eretz Yisrael.</p></div>
<div class="indent2"><span class="nm">1.</span><p><span class="cl">Ilfa added:</span> There was a case of a man that was pained by his great desire for a woman who lived in Chutz la'Aretz. He was about to go; when he heard Karna's teaching, he held himself back, and stayed in Eretz Yisrael the rest of his life.</p></div>
<div class="indent2"><span class="nm">2.</span><p>Even though you (Rabah) are great, one who learns from a Rav is incomparably better.</p></div>
<div class="indent3"><span class="nm">i.</span><p>Don't say that you do not have a Rav here. There is R. Yochanan!</p></div>
<div class="indent2"><span class="nm">3.</span><p>If you will not come, beware of three things:</p></div>
<div class="indent3"><span class="nm">i.</span><p>Do not sit too much, for this causes Tachtoniyos (hemorrhoids);</p></div>
<div class="indent3"><span class="nm">ii.</span><p>Do not stand too much, since this is bad for the heart;</p></div>
<div class="indent3"><span class="nm">iii.</span><p>Do not walk too much, since this is bad for the eyes.</p></div>
<div class="indent2"><span class="nm">4.</span><p>Rather, one should sit a third, stand a third, and walk a third.</p></div>
<div class="indent1"><span class="nm">(m)</span><p>It is better to stand than to sit unsupported.</p></div>
<div class="indent1"><span class="nm">(n)</span><p><span class="cl">Question:</span> But he said that standing is bad for the heart!</p></div>
<div class="indent1"><span class="nm">(o)</span><p><span class="cl">Answer:</span> Rather, it is better to stand with support than to sit unsupported.</p></div>
<div class="bbbline">111b----------------------------------------111b</p></div>
<div class="indent1"><span class="nm">(p)</span><p><span class="cl">(Yitzchak, Shimon and Oshaya):</span> The Halachah follows R. Yehudah regarding mules.</p></div>
<div class="indent2"><span class="nm">1.</span><p><span class="cl">(Beraisa - R. Yehudah):</span> If a mule (it is a crossbreed of a horse and donkey) desires to mate, we may not mate it with a horse or donkey, only with a mule as itself (i.e. both of their mothers were horses, or both were donkeys. R. Yehudah is unsure whether or not we are concerned also for the father's seed, or if it is considered to be just like its mother.)</p></div>
<div class="indent1"><span class="nm">(q)</span><p><span class="cl">(Rav Nachman bar Yitzchak):</span> Yitzchak (above) is R. Yitzchak Nafcha; Shimon is R. Shimon ben Pazi (alternatively - R. Shimon ben Lakish); Oshaya is R. Oshaya b'Rebbi.</p></div>
<div class="subject"><span class="nm">3)</span><p>WHO WILL BE REVIVED?</p></div>
<div class="indent1"><span class="nm">(a)</span><p><span class="cl">(R. Elazar):</span> Ignoramuses will not be revived - "The dead will not live".</p></div>
<div class="indent1"><span class="nm">(b)</span><p><span class="cl">Support#1 (Beraisa) Suggestion:</span> Perhaps "the dead will not live" applies to everyone!</p></div>
<div class="indent2"><span class="nm">1.</span><p><span class="cl">Rejection:</span> "Refa'im will not rise" - it discusses only those who Rifu (slackened) from Torah.</p></div>
<div class="indent1"><span class="nm">(c)</span><p><span class="cl">Rejection (R. Yochanan):</span> No, the verse refers to those who served idolatry.</p></div>
<div class="indent1"><span class="nm">(d)</span><p><span class="cl">Support #2 (R. Elazar, for himself):</span> "The dew of lights is Your dew, and You will cause Refa'im to fall to the ground" - the light of Torah revives only those who use the light of Torah.</p></div>
<div class="indent1"><span class="nm">(e)</span><p>R. Elazar saw that R. Yochanan was pained. He comforted him by showing that there is hope for ignoramuses:</p></div>
<div class="indent2"><span class="nm">1.</span><p><span class="cl">Question:</span> "You who cling to Hash-m are all alive today" - is it possible to cling to Hash-m?! "Hash-m is a consuming fire"!</p></div>
<div class="indent2"><span class="nm">2.</span><p><span class="cl">Answer:</span> Rather, if one who marries his daughter to a Chacham, does business for and benefits Chachamim from his property, the Torah considers him to cling to the Divine presence.</p></div>
<div class="indent1"><span class="nm">(f)</span><p><span class="cl">Question:</span> "You will love Hash-m and cling to Him" - is it possible to cling to Hash-m?</p></div>
<div class="indent1"><span class="nm">(g)</span><p><span class="cl">Answer:</span> Rather, if one marries his daughter to a Chacham, does business for and benefits Chachamim from his property, the Torah considers him to cling to the Shechinah.</p></div>
<div class="indent1"><span class="nm">(h)</span><p><span class="cl">(R. Chiya bar Rav Yosef):</span> In the future, Tzadikim will rise from the ground in Yerushalayim - "They will sprout from the city like herbs".</p></div>
<div class="indent2"><span class="nm">1.</span><p>"The city" is Yerushalayim - "I will protect this city".</p></div>
<div class="indent1"><span class="nm">(i)</span><p><span class="cl">(R. Chiya bar Rav Yosef):</span> A Kal v'Chomer teaches that Tzadikim will return to life clothed:</p></div>
<div class="indent2"><span class="nm">1.</span><p>Wheat is planted bare, and it rises with many covers. Tzadikim are buried clothed, all the more so they will rise clothed!</p></div>
<div class="subject"><span class="nm">4)</span><p>THE PRODUCE OF ERETZ YISRAEL</p></div>
<div class="indent1"><span class="nm">(a)</span><p><span class="cl">(R. Chiya bar Rav Yosef):</span> In the future, buns and silk garments will grow in Eretz Yisrael - "Yehi <i>Pisas</i> Bar ba'Aretz" (alludes to something of grain as big as a palm (Pas), and also to Kesones Pasim).</p></div>
<div class="indent1"><span class="nm">(b)</span><p><span class="cl">(Beraisa):</span> "Yehi Pisas Bar ba'Aretz b'Rosh Harim" - in the future, wheat will grow like palm trees on the mountaintops.</p></div>
<div class="indent2"><span class="nm">1.</span><p><span class="cl">Suggestion:</span> Perhaps it will be hard to harvest.</p></div>
<div class="indent2"><span class="nm">2.</span><p><span class="cl">Rejection:</span> "Its fruit will rustle like (trees of) Levanon" - Hash-m will bring a wind from His storehouse, causing the produce to fall. A person will take a handful from the field to feed his household.</p></div>
<div class="indent1"><span class="nm">(c)</span><p>"With choice Kilyos of wheat" - in the future, wheat will be like big like the two kidneys of a large ox.</p></div>
<div class="indent2"><span class="nm">1.</span><p>Do not be surprised at this. A fox made its den in a turnip, and the remains of the turnip weighed 60 Litra (60 pounds).</p></div>
<div class="indent1"><span class="nm">(d)</span><p><span class="cl">(Beraisa - R. Yosi):</span> In Sichin, a man inherited three branches of mustard. One split open; it contained nine Kavim of mustard, and the wood covered a potter's shack.</p></div>
<div class="indent1"><span class="nm">(e)</span><p><span class="cl">R. Shimon ben Tachlifa:</span> My father left us a head of cabbage; we used a ladder to climb onto it.</p></div>
<div class="indent1"><span class="nm">(f)</span><p>"You will drink wine, the blood of the grape" - the world to come will be unlike this world;</p></div>
<div class="indent2"><span class="nm">1.</span><p>In this world, it is a toil to harvest and press grapes. In the world to come, a man will bring a grape in a wagon or boat, put it in a corner of his house, and it will supply him like a fattened ox;</p></div>
<div class="indent2"><span class="nm">2.</span><p>The vine branch will be used as fuel for cooking.</p></div>
<div class="indent2"><span class="nm">3.</span><p>Each grape will contain 30 Sa'im of wine. We read "you will drink <i>Cheimar</i>" like Chomer (30 Sa'im).</p></div>
<div class="indent1"><span class="nm">(g)</span><p><span class="cl">(Rav Dimi):</span> "He will tie his foal to the vine" - every vine in Eretz Yisrael will require a foal to harvest it.</p></div>
<div class="indent1"><span class="nm">(h)</span><p>"And his donkey's children to the Serekah (vine branch)" - every Serak (barren tree) will produce what two donkeys can bear.</p></div>

<div class="indent2"><span class="nm">2.</span><p><span class="cl">Rejection:</span> "He will wash his garment in wine".</p></div>
<div class="indent2"><span class="nm">3.</span><p><span class="cl">Suggestion:</span> Perhaps it will not be red?</p></div>

<div class="indent2"><span class="nm">5.</span><p><span class="cl">Suggestion:</span> Perhaps it will not intoxicate?</p></div>
<div class="indent2"><span class="nm">6.</span><p><span class="cl">Rejection:</span> "Susah" (this connotes seducing).</p></div>

<div class="indent2"><span class="nm">8.</span><p><span class="cl">Rejection:</span> "Ha'Chlili (red) eyed from wine" - any palate that tastes it will say(give) "Li Li (to me, to me)".</p></div>

<div class="indent1"><span class="nm">(j)</span><p><span class="cl">Answer (Rav Dimi):</span> The congregation of Yisrael asks Hash-m 'Hint with Your eyes that are sweeter than wine, and show me Your teeth, that are better than milk'.</p></div>
<div class="indent1"><span class="nm">(k)</span><p>This supports R. Yochanan.</p></div>
<div class="indent2"><span class="nm">1.</span><p><span class="cl">(R. Yochanan):</span> One who whitens his teeth (smiles) at his friend is better than one who gives him milk. We read the verse "Libun (whitening) teeth (is better) than milk".</p></div>
