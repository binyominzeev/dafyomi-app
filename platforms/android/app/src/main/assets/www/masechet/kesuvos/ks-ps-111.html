<p class="bas subject"><span class="nm">1)</span>THE ATTRIBUTES OF LIVING IN <i>ERETZ</i> <i>YISRAEL</i> (cont.)</p>
<p class="bas indent1"><span class="nm">(a)</span>R. Zeira wanted to go to Eretz Yisrael, so he was avoiding Rav Yehudah (his Rebbi).</p>
<p class="bas indent2"><span class="nm">1.</span><span class="cl">(Rav Yehudah):</span> Anyone who goes from Bavel to Eretz Yisrael transgresses an Aseh - "They will be brought to Bavel, and there they will be until I redeem them".</p>
<p class="bas indent1"><span class="nm">(b)</span>R. Zeira explains that the verse discusses the Kelim of the Mikdash.</p>
<p class="bas indent1"><span class="nm">(c)</span>Rav Yehudah holds that another verse forbids people to return - "I put an oath upon you, daughters of Yerushalayim, with deer or wild goats".</p>
<p class="bas indent1"><span class="nm">(d)</span>R. Zeira holds that this oath forbids Yisrael to return together, by force.</p>
<p class="bas indent1"><span class="nm">(e)</span>Rav Yehudah derives another oath from another verse, to forbid an individual to return.</p>
<p class="bas indent1"><span class="nm">(f)</span>R. Zeira learns that verse like R. Yosi b'Rebbi Chanina:</p>
<p class="bas indent2"><span class="nm">1.</span><span class="cl">(R. Yosi b'Rebbi Chanina):</span> The verses recount three oaths Hash-m imposed: Yisrael should not return together, by force; Yisrael should not rebel against the other nations; and the nations should not subjugate Yisrael too harshly.</p>
<p class="bas indent1"><span class="nm">(g)</span><span class="cl">Rav Yehudah:</span> "If you will awaken, if you will arouse" shows that there were more oaths!</p>
<p class="bas indent1"><span class="nm">(h)</span>R. Zeira learns the additional oaths like R. Levi:</p>
<p class="bas indent2"><span class="nm">1.</span><span class="cl">(R. Levi):</span> The three additional oaths forbid us to reveal the time to redemption, to push off the redemption (alternatively - to demand redemption too strongly), and to reveal the secret (of the calculation of leap years and months, or of the reasons for Mitzvos) to the nations.</p>
<p class="bas indent1"><span class="nm">(i)</span><span class="cl">(R. Elazar):</span> "With deer or wild goats" - if we do not keep the oaths, Hash-m will make our flesh prey for others, like flesh of deer or wild goats.</p>
<p class="bas indent1"><span class="nm">(j)</span><span class="cl">(R. Elazar):</span> Anyone who lives in Eretz Yisrael dwells without sin - "the neighbors should not say that I struck the inhabitants, whose sin is borne".</p>
<p class="bas indent2"><span class="nm">1.</span><span class="cl">(Rava):</span> We learned that the verse refers to those who suffer intestinal sicknesses.</p>
<p class="bas indent1"><span class="nm">(k)</span><span class="cl">(Rav Anan):</span> If one is buried in Eretz Yisrael, it is as if he is buried under the Mizbe'ach.</p>
<p class="bas indent2"><span class="nm">1.</span>It says "A Mizbe'ach of earth", and it says "Its earth atones for its people."</p>
<p class="bas indent1"><span class="nm">(l)</span>Ula frequently came to Eretz Yisrael. He died in Chutz la'Aretz.</p>
<p class="bas indent2"><span class="nm">1.</span>R. Elazar lamented "On Tamei ground you will die"!</p>
<p class="bas indent2"><span class="nm">2.</span><span class="cl">Bearers of the news:</span> His coffin is coming for burial here.</p>
<p class="bas indent2"><span class="nm">3.</span><span class="cl">(R. Elazar):</span> This is not the same as dying here.</p>
<p class="bas indent1"><span class="nm">(m)</span>A Yavam asked if he should go to Chutz la'Aretz to do Yibum.</p>
<p class="bas indent2"><span class="nm">1.</span><span class="cl">R. Chanina:</span> His brother died for marrying a Nochris (i.e. a resident of Chutz la'Aretz), blessed be Hash-m, Who killed him for that. Will the Yavam do the same?!</p>
<p class="bas indent1"><span class="nm">(n)</span><span class="cl">(Rav Yehudah citing Shmuel):</span> Just like it is forbidden to go from Eretz Yisrael to Bavel, it is forbidden to go from Bavel (which has Yeshivos that spread Torah) to other lands.</p>
<p class="bas indent2"><span class="nm">1.</span><span class="cl">(Rabah and Rav Yosef):</span> One may not even go from Pumbedisa (Rav Yehudah, Rabah, Rav Yosef, Abaye and Rava were successive Roshei Yeshiva there) to Bei Kuvi.</p>
<p class="bas indent2"><span class="nm">2.</span>A man went from Pumbedisa to Bei Kuvi, and Rav Yosef excommunicated him.</p>
<p class="bas indent2"><span class="nm">3.</span>A man went from Pumbedisa to Astonya, and he died.</p>
<p class="bas indent2"><span class="nm">4.</span><span class="cl">Abaye:</span> Had this Chacham wanted to live, he could have lived (by staying in Pumbedisa)!</p>
<p class="bas indent1"><span class="nm">(o)</span><span class="cl">(Rabah and Rav Yosef):</span> Eretz Yisrael absorbs the best of Bavel; Bavel absorbs the best of other lands.</p>
<p class="bas indent1"><span class="nm">(p)</span><span class="cl">Question:</span> To what does this refer?</p>
<p class="bas indent2"><span class="nm">1.</span><span class="cl">Suggestion:</span> It refers to lineage.</p>
<p class="bas indent2"><span class="nm">2.</span><span class="cl">Rejection:</span> It was taught that we consider people of other lands to be of doubtful lineage relative to Eretz Yisrael, and Eretz Yisrael has doubtful lineage compared to Bavel! (Ezra took all people of bad lineage with him to Eretz Yisrael.)</p>
<p class="bas indent1"><span class="nm">(q)</span><span class="cl">Answer:</span> Rather, it refers to burial.</p>
<p class="bas indent1"><span class="nm">(r)</span><span class="cl">(Rav Yehudah):</span> One who dwells in Bavel is as if he dwells in Eretz Yisrael - "Take refuge in Tziyon, dwellers of Bavel".</p>
<p class="bas indent1"><span class="nm">(s)</span><span class="cl">(Abaye):</span> We have a tradition that Bavel will not see the birthpangs of Mashi'ach. This refers to Hutzal of Binyamin.</p>
<p class="bas indent2"><span class="nm">1.</span>Then it will be called "The horn of salvation."</p>
<p class="bas subject"><span class="nm">2)</span>REVIVAL OF THE DEAD IN <i>CHUTZ</i> <i>LA'ARETZ</i></p>
<p class="bas indent1"><span class="nm">(a)</span><span class="cl">(R. Elazar):</span> The dead in Chutz la'Aretz will not live - "I will put Tzvi (glory) in the land of the living." The dead will live only in the land in which is Tzivyoni (My desire).</p>
<p class="bas indent1"><span class="nm">(b)</span><span class="cl">Question (R. Aba bar Mamal - Beraisa):</span> "Your dead will live" refers to those who die in Eretz Yisrael. "the Mesim of My nation will rise" are those who die in Chutz la'Aretz;</p>
<p class="bas indent2"><span class="nm">1.</span>"I will put Tzvi in the land of the living" refers to Nevuchadnetzar, a king as fast as a deer, who was sent to ravage Eretz Yisrael!</p>
<p class="bas indent1"><span class="nm">(c)</span><span class="cl">Answer (R. Elazar):</span> Another verse supports me - "He gives a soul to the nation on it (Eretz Yisrael) and spirit to those who walk in it";</p>
<p class="bas indent2"><span class="nm">1.</span>"The Mesim of My nation" refers to stillborn babies (of Eretz Yisrael).</p>
<p class="bas indent1"><span class="nm">(d)</span>R. Aba explains "He gives a soul to the nation on it" like R. Avahu:</p>
<p class="bas indent2"><span class="nm">1.</span><span class="cl">(R. Avahu):</span> Even a Kena'ani slave in Eretz Yisrael is guaranteed a share in the world to come.</p>
<p class="bas indent2"><span class="nm">2.</span>It says "He gives a soul l'Am (to the nation) on it", and it says "Wait here Im (with) the donkey" - we read 'Im' like 'Am', a nation that resembles a donkey.</p>
<p class="bas indent1"><span class="nm">(e)</span><span class="cl">(R. Yirmiyah bar Aba):</span> "And spirit to those who walk in it" - anyone who walks four Amos in Eretz Yisrael is guaranteed a share in the world to come.</p>
<p class="bas indent1"><span class="nm">(f)</span><span class="cl">Question:</span> Does R. Elazar really hold that the dead outside of Eretz Yisrael will not live?!</p>
<p class="bas indent1"><span class="nm">(g)</span><span class="cl">Answer (R. Ila):</span> Their bones roll to Eretz Yisrael, and come to life in Eretz Yisrael.</p>
<p class="bas indent1"><span class="nm">(h)</span><span class="cl">Question (R. Aba Sala Rava):</span> Surely, Tzadikim should not endure such pain!</p>
<p class="bas indent1"><span class="nm">(i)</span><span class="cl">Answer (Abaye):</span> Underground tunnels are made for Tzadikim.</p>
<p class="bas indent1"><span class="nm">(j)</span><span class="cl">Question (Karna):</span> Yakov Avinu knew that he was a total Tzadik. If the dead of Chutz la'Aretz live, why did he trouble his children to bury him in Eretz Yisrael?</p>
<p class="bas indent1"><span class="nm">(k)</span><span class="cl">Answer:</span> He was concerned lest he not merit tunnels.</p>
<p class="bas indent2"><span class="nm">1.</span>R. Chanina asked similarly about Yosef ha'Tzadik, and gave the same answer.</p>
<p class="bas indent1"><span class="nm">(l)</span>Rabah's brothers sent Karna's teaching to Rabah, to try to persuade him to come to Eretz Yisrael.</p>
<p class="bas indent2"><span class="nm">1.</span><span class="cl">Ilfa added:</span> There was a case of a man that was pained by his great desire for a woman who lived in Chutz la'Aretz. He was about to go; when he heard Karna's teaching, he held himself back, and stayed in Eretz Yisrael the rest of his life.</p>
<p class="bas indent2"><span class="nm">2.</span>Even though you (Rabah) are great, one who learns from a Rav is incomparably better.</p>
<p class="bas indent3"><span class="nm">i.</span>Don't say that you do not have a Rav here. There is R. Yochanan!</p>
<p class="bas indent2"><span class="nm">3.</span>If you will not come, beware of three things:</p>
<p class="bas indent3"><span class="nm">i.</span>Do not sit too much, for this causes Tachtoniyos (hemorrhoids);</p>
<p class="bas indent3"><span class="nm">ii.</span>Do not stand too much, since this is bad for the heart;</p>
<p class="bas indent3"><span class="nm">iii.</span>Do not walk too much, since this is bad for the eyes.</p>
<p class="bas indent2"><span class="nm">4.</span>Rather, one should sit a third, stand a third, and walk a third.</p>
<p class="bas indent1"><span class="nm">(m)</span>It is better to stand than to sit unsupported.</p>
<p class="bas indent1"><span class="nm">(n)</span><span class="cl">Question:</span> But he said that standing is bad for the heart!</p>
<p class="bas indent1"><span class="nm">(o)</span><span class="cl">Answer:</span> Rather, it is better to stand with support than to sit unsupported.</p>
<p class="bas bbbline">111b----------------------------------------111b</p>
<p class="bas indent1"><span class="nm">(p)</span><span class="cl">(Yitzchak, Shimon and Oshaya):</span> The Halachah follows R. Yehudah regarding mules.</p>
<p class="bas indent2"><span class="nm">1.</span><span class="cl">(Beraisa - R. Yehudah):</span> If a mule (it is a crossbreed of a horse and donkey) desires to mate, we may not mate it with a horse or donkey, only with a mule as itself (i.e. both of their mothers were horses, or both were donkeys. R. Yehudah is unsure whether or not we are concerned also for the father's seed, or if it is considered to be just like its mother.)</p>
<p class="bas indent1"><span class="nm">(q)</span><span class="cl">(Rav Nachman bar Yitzchak):</span> Yitzchak (above) is R. Yitzchak Nafcha; Shimon is R. Shimon ben Pazi (alternatively - R. Shimon ben Lakish); Oshaya is R. Oshaya b'Rebbi.</p>
<p class="bas subject"><span class="nm">3)</span>WHO WILL BE REVIVED?</p>
<p class="bas indent1"><span class="nm">(a)</span><span class="cl">(R. Elazar):</span> Ignoramuses will not be revived - "The dead will not live".</p>
<p class="bas indent1"><span class="nm">(b)</span><span class="cl">Support#1 (Beraisa) Suggestion:</span> Perhaps "the dead will not live" applies to everyone!</p>
<p class="bas indent2"><span class="nm">1.</span><span class="cl">Rejection:</span> "Refa'im will not rise" - it discusses only those who Rifu (slackened) from Torah.</p>
<p class="bas indent1"><span class="nm">(c)</span><span class="cl">Rejection (R. Yochanan):</span> No, the verse refers to those who served idolatry.</p>
<p class="bas indent1"><span class="nm">(d)</span><span class="cl">Support #2 (R. Elazar, for himself):</span> "The dew of lights is Your dew, and You will cause Refa'im to fall to the ground" - the light of Torah revives only those who use the light of Torah.</p>
<p class="bas indent1"><span class="nm">(e)</span>R. Elazar saw that R. Yochanan was pained. He comforted him by showing that there is hope for ignoramuses:</p>
<p class="bas indent2"><span class="nm">1.</span><span class="cl">Question:</span> "You who cling to Hash-m are all alive today" - is it possible to cling to Hash-m?! "Hash-m is a consuming fire"!</p>
<p class="bas indent2"><span class="nm">2.</span><span class="cl">Answer:</span> Rather, if one who marries his daughter to a Chacham, does business for and benefits Chachamim from his property, the Torah considers him to cling to the Divine presence.</p>
<p class="bas indent1"><span class="nm">(f)</span><span class="cl">Question:</span> "You will love Hash-m and cling to Him" - is it possible to cling to Hash-m?</p>
<p class="bas indent1"><span class="nm">(g)</span><span class="cl">Answer:</span> Rather, if one marries his daughter to a Chacham, does business for and benefits Chachamim from his property, the Torah considers him to cling to the Shechinah.</p>
<p class="bas indent1"><span class="nm">(h)</span><span class="cl">(R. Chiya bar Rav Yosef):</span> In the future, Tzadikim will rise from the ground in Yerushalayim - "They will sprout from the city like herbs".</p>
<p class="bas indent2"><span class="nm">1.</span>"The city" is Yerushalayim - "I will protect this city".</p>
<p class="bas indent1"><span class="nm">(i)</span><span class="cl">(R. Chiya bar Rav Yosef):</span> A Kal v'Chomer teaches that Tzadikim will return to life clothed:</p>
<p class="bas indent2"><span class="nm">1.</span>Wheat is planted bare, and it rises with many covers. Tzadikim are buried clothed, all the more so they will rise clothed!</p>
<p class="bas subject"><span class="nm">4)</span>THE PRODUCE OF <i>ERETZ</i> <i>YISRAEL</i></p>
<p class="bas indent1"><span class="nm">(a)</span><span class="cl">(R. Chiya bar Rav Yosef):</span> In the future, buns and silk garments will grow in Eretz Yisrael - "Yehi <i>Pisas</i> Bar ba'Aretz" (alludes to something of grain as big as a palm (Pas), and also to Kesones Pasim).</p>
<p class="bas indent1"><span class="nm">(b)</span><span class="cl">(Beraisa):</span> "Yehi Pisas Bar ba'Aretz b'Rosh Harim" - in the future, wheat will grow like palm trees on the mountaintops.</p>
<p class="bas indent2"><span class="nm">1.</span><span class="cl">Suggestion:</span> Perhaps it will be hard to harvest.</p>
<p class="bas indent2"><span class="nm">2.</span><span class="cl">Rejection:</span> "Its fruit will rustle like (trees of) Levanon" - Hash-m will bring a wind from His storehouse, causing the produce to fall. A person will take a handful from the field to feed his household.</p>
<p class="bas indent1"><span class="nm">(c)</span>"With choice Kilyos of wheat" - in the future, wheat will be like big like the two kidneys of a large ox.</p>
<p class="bas indent2"><span class="nm">1.</span>Do not be surprised at this. A fox made its den in a turnip, and the remains of the turnip weighed 60 Litra (60 pounds).</p>
<p class="bas indent1"><span class="nm">(d)</span><span class="cl">(Beraisa - R. Yosi):</span> In Sichin, a man inherited three branches of mustard. One split open; it contained nine Kavim of mustard, and the wood covered a potter's shack.</p>
<p class="bas indent1"><span class="nm">(e)</span><span class="cl">R. Shimon ben Tachlifa:</span> My father left us a head of cabbage; we used a ladder to climb onto it.</p>
<p class="bas indent1"><span class="nm">(f)</span>"You will drink wine, the blood of the grape" - the world to come will be unlike this world;</p>
<p class="bas indent2"><span class="nm">1.</span>In this world, it is a toil to harvest and press grapes. In the world to come, a man will bring a grape in a wagon or boat, put it in a corner of his house, and it will supply him like a fattened ox;</p>
<p class="bas indent2"><span class="nm">2.</span>The vine branch will be used as fuel for cooking.</p>
<p class="bas indent2"><span class="nm">3.</span>Each grape will contain 30 Sa'im of wine. We read "you will drink <i>Cheimar</i>" like Chomer (30 Sa'im).</p>
<p class="bas indent1"><span class="nm">(g)</span><span class="cl">(Rav Dimi):</span> "He will tie his foal to the vine" - every vine in Eretz Yisrael will require a foal to harvest it.</p>
<p class="bas indent1"><span class="nm">(h)</span>"And his donkey's children to the Serekah (vine branch)" - every Serak (barren tree) will produce what two donkeys can bear.</p>
<p class="bas indent2"><span class="nm">1.</span><span class="cl">Suggestion:</span> Perhaps there will be no moisture in it?</p>
<p class="bas indent2"><span class="nm">2.</span><span class="cl">Rejection:</span> "He will wash his garment in wine".</p>
<p class="bas indent2"><span class="nm">3.</span><span class="cl">Suggestion:</span> Perhaps it will not be red?</p>
<p class="bas indent2"><span class="nm">4.</span><span class="cl">Rejection:</span> "The blood of the grape..."</p>
<p class="bas indent2"><span class="nm">5.</span><span class="cl">Suggestion:</span> Perhaps it will not intoxicate?</p>
<p class="bas indent2"><span class="nm">6.</span><span class="cl">Rejection:</span> "Susah" (this connotes seducing).</p>
<p class="bas indent2"><span class="nm">7.</span><span class="cl">Suggestion:</span> Perhaps it will have no taste?</p>
<p class="bas indent2"><span class="nm">8.</span><span class="cl">Rejection:</span> "Ha'Chlili (red) eyed from wine" - any palate that tastes it will say(give) "Li Li (to me, to me)".</p>
<p class="bas indent2"><span class="nm">9.</span><span class="cl">Suggestion:</span> Perhaps it is good for youths only?</p>
<p class="bas indent2"><span class="nm">10.</span><span class="cl">Rejection:</span> "Ul'Ven Shinayim" can be read "ul'Ven Shanim" (a man of years).</p>
<p class="bas indent1"><span class="nm">(i)</span><span class="cl">Question:</span> What is the simple meaning of the verse?</p>
<p class="bas indent1"><span class="nm">(j)</span><span class="cl">Answer (Rav Dimi):</span> The congregation of Yisrael asks Hash-m 'Hint with Your eyes that are sweeter than wine, and show me Your teeth, that are better than milk'.</p>
<p class="bas indent1"><span class="nm">(k)</span>This supports R. Yochanan.</p>
<p class="bas indent2"><span class="nm">1.</span><span class="cl">(R. Yochanan):</span> One who whitens his teeth (smiles) at his friend is better than one who gives him milk. We read the verse "Libun (whitening) teeth (is better) than milk".</p>
<p class="bas indent1"><span class="nm">(l)</span>R. Chiya bar Ada was the teacher of Reish Lakish's children. He did not come for three days.</p>
<p class="bas indent2"><span class="nm">1.</span><span class="cl">Reish Lakish:</span> Why didn't you come?</p>
<p class="bas indent2"><span class="nm">2.</span><span class="cl">R. Chiya bar Ada:</span> My father left me a vineyard of vines on poles. The first day I harvested 300 clusters; each produced a Se'ah. The second day I harvested 300 clusters; each produced half a Se'ah. The third day I harvested 300 clusters, each produced a third of a Se'ah, and I made the majority of the vineyard ownerless!</p>
<p class="bas indent2"><span class="nm">3.</span><span class="cl">Reish Lakish:</span> Had you not neglected your job, it would have produced more.</p>
<p class="bas indent1"><span class="nm">(m)</span>Rami bar Yechezkel saw goats eating under fig trees in Bnei Berak. Honey was dripping from the figs, and milk from the goats, and they mixed. This is "flowing with milk and honey".</p>
<p class="bas indent1"><span class="nm">(n)</span><span class="cl">(R. Yakov ben Dostai):</span> It is three Mil (a Mil is about a kilometer) from Lud to Ono. I once went before dawn, and I was up to my ankles in date honey.</p>
<p class="bas indent1"><span class="nm">(o)</span><span class="cl">(Reish Lakish):</span> I saw the (region flowing with) milk and honey of Tzipori. It was 16 Mil by 16 Mil.</p>
<p class="bas indent1"><span class="nm">(p)</span><span class="cl">(Rabah bar bar Chanah):</span> I saw the milk and honey of all of Eretz Yisrael. It was 88 Mil by 24 Mil.</p>
