<p class="bas indent1"><span class="nm">(a)</span><span class="cl">(Mishnah):</span> Like wine mixed with two parts of water...</p>
<p class="bas indent1"><span class="nm">(b)</span><span class="cl">(Beraisa):</span> (Mixed - some texts delete this) Sharoni wine is like (undiluted) Karmeli wine.</p>
<p class="bas indent1"><span class="nm">(c)</span>One should mix wine and check immediately (he should not use old mixed wine).</p>
<p class="bas indent1"><span class="nm">(d)</span><span class="cl">(R. Yitzchak bar Avodimi):</span> We put the wine in a glass cup made in Teverya.</p>
<p class="bas indent1"><span class="nm">(e)</span><span class="cl">Question:</span> What is the reason?</p>
<p class="bas indent1"><span class="nm">(f)</span><span class="cl">Answer (Abaye):</span> Everywhere else, a Maneh (the weight of 100 Zuz) of glass is used to make a glass that holds a Lug. Two Manos are used to make a two Lug glass;</p>
<p class="bas indent2"><span class="nm">1.</span>In Teverya, they make a two Lug glass from one Maneh. Since the glass is thinner, the wine is seen better.</p>

<p class="bas indent1"><span class="nm">(a)</span><span class="cl">(Mishnah):</span> If a woman "miscarried" a piece of flesh (it fell from her Ervah):</p>

<p class="bas indent1"><span class="nm">(d)</span>R. Meir says, if she miscarried (something resembling) a Behemah, Chayah or bird, whether Tamei or Tahor --</p>
<p class="bas indent2"><span class="nm">1.</span>She is Teme'ah Yoledes, according to the gender of what she gave birth to;</p>

<p class="bas indent1"><span class="nm">(f)</span><span class="cl">Version #1 (Gemara - Shmuel):</span> R. Yehudah is Metamei (without blood) only if the flesh has the color of one of the four Tamei appearances of blood. If not, he is Metaher.</p>
<p class="bas indent1"><span class="nm">(g)</span><span class="cl">(R. Yochanan):</span> R. Yehudah and Chachamim agree that if the flesh is one of the four colors, she is Nidah. If not, she is Tehorah;</p>
<p class="bas indent2"><span class="nm">1.</span>They argue when we do not know the color of the flesh:</p>
<p class="bas indent2"><span class="nm">2.</span>R. Yehudah follows the majority. Most miscarried flesh is one of the four colors.</p>
<p class="bas indent2"><span class="nm">3.</span>Chachamim say, the majority is not from the four colors (Tosfos. Ramban - it is an even Safek, so she retains her Chazakah.)</p>

<p class="bas indent2"><span class="nm">1.</span>R. Yehudah says, in either case she is Teme'ah.</p>

<p class="bas indent1"><span class="nm">(k)</span><span class="cl">Answer (for R. Yochanan's understanding of Chachamim):</span> Perhaps Chachamim are not Metaher red and black, only yellow and white. They say that the law of red and black is like R. Yehudah says.</p>

<p class="bas indent1"><span class="nm">(m)</span><span class="cl">(Rav Nachman bar Yitzchak):</span> Rather, they argue about whether the womb can open (for a birth or miscarriage) without blood, like the following Tana'im argue:</p>
<p class="bas indent2"><span class="nm">1.</span><span class="cl">(Beraisa):</span> If a woman saw blood amidst labor pains on two consecutive days and she miscarried on the third day, and she does not know what came out, she is Safek Yoledes (for perhaps she miscarried a Nefel), Safek Zavah (perhaps she did not miscarry a Nefel, but saw blood), and Safek neither (perhaps there was no Nefel nor blood);</p>
<p class="bas bbbline">21b----------------------------------------21b</p>
<p class="bas indent3"><span class="nm">i.</span>She brings Korbanos (Olas ha'Of and Chatas ha'Of, which exempt a Yoledes or Zavah). The Chatas is not eaten. (If in truth she is neither Yoledes nor Zavah, she was exempt from Korbanos. The Olah is a (valid) Nedavah, but the Chatas is Pasul. One may bring Chatas ha'Of due to Safek, just it is not eaten.)</p>
<p class="bas indent2"><span class="nm">2.</span>R. Yehoshua says, she brings Korbanos and the Chatas is eaten, for the womb never opens without blood. (She is definitely a Yoledes or Zavah. In either case she must bring Korbanos.)</p>

<p class="bas subject"><span class="nm">3)</span>A WOMAN WHO MISCARRIED FLESH</p>
<p class="bas indent1"><span class="nm">(a)</span><span class="cl">(Beraisa #1 - Sumchus):</span> If a woman miscarried a piece of flesh, she should tear it open. If there is blood inside, she is Teme'ah. If not, she is Tehorah.</p>
<p class="bas indent1"><span class="nm">(b)</span>This is like Chachamim (in one respect), and (in another respect) it is more stringent than Chachamim;</p>
<p class="bas indent2"><span class="nm">1.</span>It is like Chachamim, who say that the womb can open without blood;</p>
<p class="bas indent2"><span class="nm">2.</span>It is more stringent than Chachamim. They are Metamei only if blood accompanies it, but Sumchus is Metamei even if blood is merely found inside.</p>
<p class="bas indent1"><span class="nm">(c)</span><span class="cl">(Beraisa #2 - R. Acha):</span> If a woman miscarried a piece of flesh, she should tear it open. If the inside is red, she is Teme'ah. If not, she is Tehorah.</p>
<p class="bas indent1"><span class="nm">(d)</span>This is like Sumchus, and it is more stringent (it is Metamei anything red inside, and not only blood).</p>
<p class="bas indent1"><span class="nm">(e)</span><span class="cl">(Beraisa #3 - R. Binyamin):</span> If a woman miscarried a piece of flesh, she should tear it open. If there is a bone inside, she is Teme'ah like a Yoledes.</p>

<p class="bas indent1"><span class="nm">(g)</span><span class="cl">Support (Beraisa):</span> If a woman miscarried a white piece of flesh, she should tear it open. If there is a bone inside, she is Teme'ah like a Yoledes.</p>

<p class="bas indent1"><span class="nm">(i)</span>This is like Sumchus, and it is more lenient than all the other Tana'im. (It is Metaher a small amount of blood inside.)</p>
<p class="bas indent1"><span class="nm">(j)</span><span class="cl">Question (R. Yirmeyah):</span> If a tube is inserted into the Cheder and blood comes through (and leaves her), what is the law?</p>
<p class="bas indent2"><span class="nm">1.</span>Perhaps she is Teme'ah only if the blood is "bi'Vsarah," but not in a tube?</p>
<p class="bas indent2"><span class="nm">2.</span>Or, perhaps "bi'Vsarah" teaches only that she becomes Teme'ah when the blood is still inside her (in the Prozdor), just like when it leaves her?</p>
<p class="bas indent1"><span class="nm">(k)</span><span class="cl">Answer (R. Zeira):</span> The blood must be "bi'Vsarah," and not in a tube;</p>
<p class="bas indent2"><span class="nm">1.</span>Had the Torah wanted to teach only that she becomes Teme'ah when the blood is still inside her like when it leaves, it should have said 'Besarah';</p>
<p class="bas indent2"><span class="nm">2.</span>Since it says "bi'Vsarah," we learn both.</p>
<p class="bas indent1"><span class="nm">(l)</span><span class="cl">Question:</span> R. Yochanan taught, if a woman miscarried a piece of flesh, she should tear it open. If there is much blood inside, she is Teme'ah. If not, she is Tehorah. (Blood inside flesh is like blood inside a tube!)</p>
<p class="bas indent1"><span class="nm">(m)</span><span class="cl">Answer:</span> It is normal for blood to leave the Cheder inside flesh (and the flesh is the same Min (type) as her body), therefore it is not a Chatzitzah (separation);</p>
<p class="bas indent2"><span class="nm">1.</span>It is not normal for blood to leave in a tube, therefore that is a Chatzitzah.</p>
<p class="bas indent1"><span class="nm">(n)</span><span class="cl">Suggestion:</span> Tana'im argue about blood that leaves in a tube:</p>
<p class="bas indent2"><span class="nm">1.</span><span class="cl">(Beraisa):</span> If a woman miscarried a piece of flesh, even if there is blood inside, she is Teme'ah only if blood came with it;</p>
<p class="bas indent2"><span class="nm">2.</span>R. Eliezer says, "bi'Vsarah" excludes in a Shefir (the outer skin of a fetus before bones form) or piece of flesh.</p>
<p class="bas indent2"><span class="nm">3.</span><span class="cl">Interjection:</span> This is like the first Tana!</p>
<p class="bas indent2"><span class="nm">4.</span><span class="cl">Correction:</span> Rather, it should say "for R. Eliezer says that 'bi'Vsarah' excludes in a Shefir or piece of flesh." (He is the first Tana);</p>

<p class="bas indent2"><span class="nm">6.</span><span class="cl">Question:</span> Also the first Tana is Metaher!</p>
<p class="bas indent2"><span class="nm">7.</span><span class="cl">Answer:</span> They argue when the piece is convoluted (and the blood is between the folds):</p>
<p class="bas indent3"><span class="nm">i.</span>R. Eliezer holds that "bi'Vsarah" excludes in a Shefir or piece. He likewise excludes in a tube;</p>
<p class="bas indent3"><span class="nm">ii.</span>However, he excludes only (blood inside) a smooth piece, but blood between the folds of a convoluted piece is Metamei. It is considered "bi'Vsarah";</p>
<p class="bas indent3"><span class="nm">iii.</span>Chachamim hold that even then she is Tehorah. The blood is of the piece. It is not Dam Nidah.</p>
<p class="bas indent3"><span class="nm">iv.</span><span class="cl">Inference:</span> If the blood would be Dam Nidah, she would be Teme'ah, even though there is a Chatzitzah. The same applies if it left in a tube!</p>
