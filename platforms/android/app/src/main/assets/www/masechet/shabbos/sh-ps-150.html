<p class="bas subject"><span class="nm">1)</span>DISCUSSING BUSINESS ON SHABBOS</p>
<p class="bas indent1"><span class="nm">(a)</span><span class="cl">(Mishnah):</span> One may not hire workers on Shabbos;</p>
<p class="bas indent1"><span class="nm">(b)</span>[On Shabbos,] one may not ask his friend to hire workers for him;</p>
<p class="bas indent1"><span class="nm">(c)</span>One may not Machshich on the Techum (towards the end of Shabbos go to the end of the Techum, i.e. as far from the city as is permitted) to hire workers or to bring produce [from outside the Techum];</p>
<p class="bas indent1"><span class="nm">(d)</span>One may Machshich [on the Techum] to guard produce - he may return with produce.</p>
<p class="bas indent1"><span class="nm">(e)</span>Aba Sha'ul says, the general rule is - if [on Shabbos] one may ask someone to do something [after Shabbos], he may Machshich for it.</p>
<p class="bas indent1"><span class="nm">(f)</span><span class="cl">(Gemara) Question:</span> [Why must it forbid hiring workers and asking a friend to hire workers -] surely the law is the same for him and his friend!</p>
<p class="bas indent1"><span class="nm">(g)</span><span class="cl">Answer #1 (Rav Papa):</span> The Mishnah forbids asking a Nochri friend.</p>
<p class="bas indent1"><span class="nm">(h)</span><span class="cl">Objection (Rav Ashi):</span> It is Shevus (forbidden mid'Rabanan) to ask a Nochri to do things forbidden on Shabbos! (Another Mishnah (121A) already teaches this. Mid'Rabanan, we are stringent to consider him a Shali'ach; alternatively, it is forbidden on account of "Daber Davar", discussing things that are forbidden on Shabbos.)</p>
<p class="bas indent1"><span class="nm">(i)</span><span class="cl">Answer #2 (Rav Ashi):</span> It even discusses asking a Yisrael friend - we infer that one may not ask him to hire workers, but one may tell him to meet at night (he understands, for the sake of work);</p>
<p class="bas indent1"><span class="nm">(j)</span>Our Mishnah is like R. Yehoshua ben Korchah:</p>
<p class="bas indent2"><span class="nm">1.</span><span class="cl">(Beraisa):</span> Reuven may not tell Shimon 'Come to me at night' [so I can hire you];</p>
<p class="bas indent2"><span class="nm">2.</span>R. Yehoshua ben Korchah permits.</p>
<p class="bas indent1"><span class="nm">(k)</span><span class="cl">(Rabah bar bar Chanah):</span> The Halachah follows R. Yehoshua ben Korchah.</p>
<p class="bas indent1"><span class="nm">(l)</span><span class="cl">(R. Yochanan):</span> R. Yehoshua ben Korchah expounds "Mi'Mtzo Cheftzecha v'Daber Davar" - speech [that explicitly discusses Melachah] is forbidden, thoughts are permitted.</p>
<p class="bas indent1"><span class="nm">(m)</span><span class="cl">Question (Rav Acha bar Rav Huna):</span> R. Yochanan cannot hold that speech is forbidden and thoughts are permitted, for this implies that thoughts are not considered speech;</p>
<p class="bas indent2"><span class="nm">1.</span>But R. Yochanan taught that one may think about Torah anywhere except for a bathhouse or bathroom, for this is not "V'Hayah Machanecha Kodesh";</p>
<p class="bas indent2"><span class="nm">2.</span>Regarding this it says "V'Lo Yir'eh Vecha Ervas Davar" (he should likewise expound, speech is forbidden, thoughts are permitted)!</p>
<p class="bas indent1"><span class="nm">(n)</span><span class="cl">Answer:</span> "Ervas Davar" is expounded to teach Rav Yehudah's law:</p>
<p class="bas indent2"><span class="nm">1.</span>One may not recite Shma facing a naked Nochri.</p>
<p class="bas indent2"><span class="nm">2.</span><span class="cl">Question:</span> It is forbidden even facing a naked Yisrael!</p>
<p class="bas indent2"><span class="nm">3.</span><span class="cl">Answer:</span> He teaches that it is forbidden not only facing a naked Yisrael, rather, even facing a naked Nochri;</p>
<p class="bas indent3"><span class="nm">i.</span>One might have thought, since it says "Asher Besar Chamorim Besaram" it is [like facing Ervah of an animal and] permitted - he teaches that this is not so.</p>
<p class="bas indent2"><span class="nm">4.</span><span class="cl">Suggestion:</span> Perhaps it is indeed permitted!</p>
<p class="bas indent2"><span class="nm">5.</span><span class="cl">Rejection:</span> "V'Ervas Avihem Lo Ra'u" (Ervah of a Nochri is called Ervah).</p>
<p class="bas indent1"><span class="nm">(o)</span><span class="cl">Question:</span> Speech is not forbidden!</p>
<p class="bas indent2"><span class="nm">1.</span><span class="cl">(Rav Chisda and Rav Hamnuna):</span> One may make calculations of a Mitzvah on Shabbos.</p>
<p class="bas indent2"><span class="nm">2.</span><span class="cl">(R. Elazar):</span> We may pledge to give Tzedakah to the poor on Shabbos.</p>
<p class="bas indent2"><span class="nm">3.</span><span class="cl">(R. Yakov Bar Idi):</span> We attend to issues of mortal danger on Shabbos, and go to synagogues and Batei Medrash to attend to communal concerns on Shabbos.</p>
<p class="bas indent2"><span class="nm">4.</span><span class="cl">(R. Shmuel Bar Nachmani):</span> We go to theaters and stadiums to attend to communal concerns on Shabbos</p>
<p class="bas indent2"><span class="nm">5.</span><span class="cl">(Tana d'vei Menasheh):</span> We may arrange engagements for girls, and contract teachers to teach Torah or a trade to boys.</p>
<p class="bas indent1"><span class="nm">(p)</span><span class="cl">Answer:</span> "Mi'Mtzo Cheftzecha v'Daber Davar" - your (business) desires are forbidden, those of Shomayim (Mitzvos) are permitted.</p>
<p class="bas subject"><span class="nm">2)</span>MAKING CALCULATIONS ON SHABBOS</p>
<p class="bas indent1"><span class="nm">(a)</span><span class="cl">(Rav Yehudah):</span> Calculations that pertain to the king [not to the one doing them], or that have no importance for anyone may be made on Shabbos.</p>
<p class="bas indent1"><span class="nm">(b)</span><span class="cl">Support (Beraisa #1):</span> [On Shabbos] one may not make calculations that were once relevant or will be relevant to him;</p>
<p class="bas indent1"><span class="nm">(c)</span>[A commoner] may make calculations relevant to the king or that have no relevance to anyone.</p>
<p class="bas bbbline">150b----------------------------------------150b</p>
<p class="bas indent1"><span class="nm">(d)</span><span class="cl">Contradiction (Beraisa #2):</span> One may make unnecessary calculations, but not those that are needed;</p>
<p class="bas indent2"><span class="nm">1.</span>For example, one may say 'I hired this many workers for this field, I spent this amount of money for this house' (Beraisa #1 forbids this);</p>
<p class="bas indent2"><span class="nm">2.</span>One may not say 'I spent this much so far, I still need to spend this much more.'</p>
<p class="bas indent1"><span class="nm">(e)</span><span class="cl">Counter-question:</span> Beraisa #1 contradicts itself! (It forbids calculations that were once relevant, even if they are no longer relevant [to him or anyone else] - the Seifa of Beraisa #1 permits them!)</p>
<p class="bas indent1"><span class="nm">(f)</span><span class="cl">Answer to both questions:</span> It is permitted if he finished paying the workers; if not, not.</p>
<p class="bas subject"><span class="nm">3)</span>WAITING BY THE <i>TECHUM</i> (<i>MACHSHICH</i>) ON SHABBOS</p>
<p class="bas indent1"><span class="nm">(a)</span><span class="cl">(Mishnah):</span> One may not Machshich...</p>
<p class="bas indent1"><span class="nm">(b)</span><span class="cl">(Beraisa):</span> A case occurred, a Chasid's fence was breached; he decided to fix the fence, then remembered that it is Shabbos - he refrained from fencing it afterwards;</p>
<p class="bas indent1"><span class="nm">(c)</span>A miracle occurred, a caper bush grew there to close the opening; its fruits financed him and his household.</p>
<p class="bas indent1"><span class="nm">(d)</span><span class="cl">(Rav Yehudah):</span> On Shabbos, one may say 'I will go to city Ploni' [even if it is outside the Techum], because if there were shacks [every 70 Amos along the way to extend the city], it would be within the Techum (going there is not inherently forbidden).</p>
<p class="bas indent1"><span class="nm">(e)</span><span class="cl">(Mishnah):</span> One may not Machshich to hire workers or to bring produce.</p>
<p class="bas indent1"><span class="nm">(f)</span><span class="cl">Question:</span> Granted, hiring workers is inherently forbidden - but it would be permitted to bring produce if there were Mechitzos (on the sides of the path from here to there, Rav Yehudah should permit this)!</p>
<p class="bas indent1"><span class="nm">(g)</span><span class="cl">Answer:</span> The case is, the fruits are attached.</p>
<p class="bas indent1"><span class="nm">(h)</span><span class="cl">Question (R. Oshaya's Beraisa):</span> One may not Machshich to bring Teven or Kash (straw that is harvested with the grain or remains attached, respectively);</p>
<p class="bas indent2"><span class="nm">1.</span>Granted, Kash is attached, but Teven is not!</p>
<p class="bas indent1"><span class="nm">(i)</span><span class="cl">Answer:</span> It discusses rotten Teven (it is Muktzeh).</p>
<p class="bas indent1"><span class="nm">(j)</span><span class="cl">Question (Mishnah):</span> One may Machshich to attend to the needs of a bride or a Mes.</p>
<p class="bas indent2"><span class="nm">1.</span><span class="cl">Inference:</span> It is permitted for needs of a bride or a Mes, not for others.</p>
<p class="bas indent2"><span class="nm">2.</span>Granted, there are needs of others resembling needs of a bride that are inherently forbidden, e.g. detaching myrtle;</p>
<p class="bas indent2"><span class="nm">3.</span>But needs of a Mes are to bring a coffin and shrouds [like the Mishnah says] - one may Machshich for similar needs of a live person [since it would be permitted if there were Mechitzos]!</p>
<p class="bas indent1"><span class="nm">(k)</span><span class="cl">Answer:</span> One may Machshich to fix shrouds, this is forbidden for a garment for a live person.</p>
<p class="bas indent1"><span class="nm">(l)</span><span class="cl">(Mishnah):</span> One may Machshich [to guard produce].</p>
<p class="bas indent1"><span class="nm">(m)</span><span class="cl">Inference:</span> [This is to save time, i.e. immediately after Shabbos] he will leave the Techum for this, even before making Havdalah.</p>
<p class="bas indent1"><span class="nm">(n)</span><span class="cl">Question:</span> R. Elazar ben Antignous taught that one may not pursue his desires before making Havdalah!</p>
<p class="bas indent2"><span class="nm">1.</span><span class="cl">Suggestion:</span> Perhaps he will make Havdalah in prayer.</p>
<p class="bas indent2"><span class="nm">2.</span><span class="cl">Rejection:</span> Rav Yehudah taught that one who makes Havdalah in prayer must also make Havdalah over a cup [of wine]!</p>
<p class="bas indent2"><span class="nm">3.</span><span class="cl">Suggestion:</span> Perhaps he will make Havdalah over a cup.</p>
<p class="bas indent2"><span class="nm">4.</span><span class="cl">Objection:</span> Where will he find a cup [of wine at the end of the Techum, i.e.] in the field?!</p>
<p class="bas indent1"><span class="nm">(o)</span><span class="cl">Answer (R. Noson bar Ami):</span> The Mishnah discusses when people are making wine (it is available in the field).</p>
<p class="bas indent1"><span class="nm">(p)</span><span class="cl">(R. Aba):</span> In Eretz Yisrael, they say 'Ha'Mavdil Bein Kodesh l'Chol', then do their needs.</p>
<p class="bas indent1"><span class="nm">(q)</span><span class="cl">(Rav Ashi):</span> In Rav Kahana's house, they would say 'Ha'Mavdil Bein Kodesh l'Chol', then cut wood.</p>
