<div class="subject"><span class="nm">1)</span><p><i>KORBANOS</i> OF <i>BNEI NO'ACH</i></p></div>
<div class="indent1"><span class="nm">(a)</span><p><span class="cl">Question (R. Elazar):</span> What is the source that a Ben No'ach may not offer an animal missing a limb?</p></div>
<div class="indent1"><span class="nm">(b)</span><p><span class="cl">Answer:</span> "Umi'Kol ha'Chai" - the limbs of the animal must be Chai (intact).</p></div>
<div class="indent1"><span class="nm">(c)</span><p><span class="cl">Answer #1:</span> Perhaps this excludes a Treifah!</p></div>
<div class="indent1"><span class="nm">(d)</span><p><span class="cl">Rejection:</span> We already know this from "Lechayos Zera" (it must be able to reproduce).</p></div>
<div class="indent1"><span class="nm">(e)</span><p><span class="cl">Question:</span> This is like the opinion that a Treifah cannot have children. According to the opinion that it can, how can we answer?</p></div>
<div class="indent1"><span class="nm">(f)</span><p><span class="cl">Answer #2:</span> We exclude Treifos from "Itach (with you, i.e. like you)."</p></div>
<div class="indent1"><span class="nm">(g)</span><p><span class="cl">Question:</span> Perhaps No'ach himself was Treifah!</p></div>
<div class="indent1"><span class="nm">(h)</span><p><span class="cl">Answer #1:</span> It says he was "Tamim".</p></div>
<div class="indent2"><span class="nm">1.</span><p><span class="cl">Question:</span> Perhaps this means that he was pure in his ways!</p></div>
<div class="indent2"><span class="nm">2.</span><p><span class="cl">Answer:</span> It already says that he was a Tzadik.</p></div>
<div class="indent2"><span class="nm">3.</span><p><span class="cl">Question:</span> Perhaps he was pure in his ways and Tzadik in his deeds!</p></div>
<div class="indent1"><span class="nm">(i)</span><p><span class="cl">Answer #2:</span> If so, Hash-m would not have told him to bring animals (Treifos) like himself!</p></div>
<div class="indent1"><span class="nm">(j)</span><p><span class="cl">Question:</span> Since we exclude Treifos from "Itach", what do we learn from "Lechayos Zera"?</p></div>
<div class="indent1"><span class="nm">(k)</span><p><span class="cl">Answer:</span> One might have thought that the animals are merely for company (and sterile animals are acceptable). "Lechayos Zera" teaches that they must be able to reproduce.</p></div>
<div class="indent1"><span class="nm">(l)</span><p><span class="cl">(Rav Huna):</span> He offered Tahor animals (and birds), but not Tamei.</p></div>
<div class="indent1"><span class="nm">(m)</span><p><span class="cl">Question:</span> Before the Torah was given, there was no distinction!</p></div>
<div class="indent1"><span class="nm">(n)</span><p><span class="cl">Answer (R. Shmuel bar Nachmani):</span> 'Tahor' refers to an animal that had not mated with a different species. (Maharsha deletes this, and says that the text should read '(he offered) animals that in the future will be Tahor. It is not clear how to resolve our text.)</p></div>
<div class="indent1"><span class="nm">(o)</span><p><span class="cl">Question:</span> How did he know which animals were 'Tahor'?</p></div>
<div class="indent1"><span class="nm">(p)</span><p><span class="cl">Answer #1:</span> We can answer as Rav Chisda explained;</p></div>
<div class="indent2"><span class="nm">1.</span><p><span class="cl">(Rav Chisda):</span> No'ach passed the animals in front of the ark, if the ark accepted (seven and seven), he knew that it was a Tahor species.</p></div>
<div class="indent1"><span class="nm">(q)</span><p><span class="cl">Answer #2 (R. Avahu):</span> "<i>Veha'Ba'im</i> Zachar u'Nekevah" - the animals came by themselves.</p></div>
<div class="subject"><span class="nm">2)</span><p>MAY <i>BNEI NO'ACH</i> OFFER <i>SHELAMIM</i>?</p></div>
<div class="indent1"><span class="nm">(a)</span><p><span class="cl">(Beraisa (from 115b)):</span> Before the Mishkan was erected, all Korbanos offered were Olos.</p></div>
<div class="indent1"><span class="nm">(b)</span><p><span class="cl">Inference:</span> It was forbidden to offer Shelamim.</p></div>
<div class="indent1"><span class="nm">(c)</span><p><span class="cl">Question:</span> It says (at Sinai, before the Mishkan) "va'Yizbechu Zevachim Shelamim"!</p></div>
<div class="indent1"><span class="nm">(d)</span><p><span class="cl">Correction:</span> Rather, all (Yisraelim and Nochrim) were permitted to offer Olos. (Shelamim were permitted only to Yisrael.)</p></div>
<div class="indent1"><span class="nm">(e)</span><p><span class="cl">Inference:</span> Shelamim were never permitted to Nochrim.</p></div>
<div class="indent1"><span class="nm">(f)</span><p>This is like the opinion that Bnei No'ach never offered Shelamim.</p></div>
<div class="indent2"><span class="nm">1.</span><p><span class="cl">(R. Elazar or R. Yosi bar Chanina):</span> Bnei No'ach offered Shelamim.</p></div>
<div class="indent2"><span class="nm">2.</span><p><span class="cl">(The other of R. Elazar and R. Yosi bar Chanina):</span> Bnei No'ach did not offer Shelamim.</p></div>
<div class="indent1"><span class="nm">(g)</span><p>The first opinion learns from "v'Hevel Hevi... <i>ume'Chelvehen</i>";</p></div>
<div class="indent2"><span class="nm">1.</span><p>This refers to Shelamim, in which the Chelev is offered on the Mizbe'ach (but the rest of the meat is not offered).</p></div>
<div class="indent1"><span class="nm">(h)</span><p>The latter opinion learns from "Uri Tzafon u'Vo'i Seiman" - a nation (Nochrim) that only offers in the north (i.e. Olos) should awaken, and will come a nation (Yisrael) that also offers (Shelamim) in the south.</p></div>
<div class="indent1"><span class="nm">(i)</span><p><span class="cl">Question:</span> How does this opinion explain the first verse?</p></div>
<div class="indent1"><span class="nm">(j)</span><p><span class="cl">Answer:</span> "Ume'Chelvehen" teaches that he offered the fattest animals he had.</p></div>
<div class="indent1"><span class="nm">(k)</span><p><span class="cl">Question:</span> How does the first opinion explain the latter verse?</p></div>
<div class="indent1"><span class="nm">(l)</span><p><span class="cl">Answer:</span> It refers to the gathering of the exiles.</p></div>
<div class="indent1"><span class="nm">(m)</span><p><span class="cl">Question:</span> Moshe told Paro "Gam Atah Titen b'Yadeinu <i>Zevachim</i> v'Olos" (i.e. Shelamim, and we will offer it on behalf of Paro)!</p></div>
<div class="indent1"><span class="nm">(n)</span><p><span class="cl">Answer:</span> 'Zevachim' are Chulin animals to be eaten. Olos are Korbanos.</p></div>
<div class="indent1"><span class="nm">(o)</span><p><span class="cl">Question:</span> It says "va'Yikach Yisro... Olah u'Zevachim"!</p></div>
<div class="indent1"><span class="nm">(p)</span><p><span class="cl">Answer #1:</span> That was after Matan Torah (he was a full Yisrael when he offered them.)</p></div>
<div class="indent1"><span class="nm">(q)</span><p><span class="cl">Question:</span> This is like the opinion that Yisro came after Matan Torah. According to the opinion that he came before Matan Torah, how can we answer?</p></div>
<div class="indent2"><span class="nm">1.</span><p><span class="cl">(Bnei R. Chiya or R. Yehoshua ben Levi):</span> Yisro came before Matan Torah.</p></div>
<div class="indent2"><span class="nm">2.</span><p><span class="cl">(The other of Bnei R. Chiya and R. Yehoshua ben Levi):</span> Yisro came after Matan Torah.</p></div>
<div class="indent1"><span class="nm">(r)</span><p><span class="cl">Answer:</span> The former opinion holds that Bnei No'ach may offer Shelamim.</p></div>
<div class="indent1"><span class="nm">(s)</span><p>Tana'im argue about when Yisro came.</p></div>
<div class="indent2"><span class="nm">1.</span><p><span class="cl">(Beraisa) Question:</span> "Va'Yishma Yisro" - what did he hear that prompted him to come to convert?</p></div>
<div class="indent2"><span class="nm">2.</span><p><span class="cl">Answer #1 (R. Yehoshua):</span> He heard about the war with Amalek, which is mentioned just before this.</p></div>
<div class="indent2"><span class="nm">3.</span><p><span class="cl">Answer #2 (R. Eliezer ha Moda'i):</span> He heard about Matan Torah;</p></div>
<div class="indent3"><span class="nm">i.</span><p>"Uv'Heichalo Kulo Omer Kavod" - when the Torah was given, Hash-m's voice was heard in the entire world. All the Nochri kings trembled and sang Shirah;</p></div>
<div class="indent3"><span class="nm">ii.</span><p><span class="cl">The kings:</span> Perhaps a flood is coming to the world - "Hash-m la'Mabul Yashav"!</p></div>
<div class="indent3"><span class="nm">iii.</span><p><span class="cl">Bil'am:</span> No, He already swore not to flood the (entire) world again.</p></div>
<div class="indent3"><span class="nm">iv.</span><p><span class="cl">The kings:</span> Perhaps he swore not to flood it with water, but he will flood it with fire - "Ki b'Esh Hash-m Nishpat"!</p></div>
<div class="indent3"><span class="nm">v.</span><p><span class="cl">Bil'am:</span> No, He already swore not to destroy all flesh.</p></div>
<div class="indent3"><span class="nm">vi.</span><p><span class="cl">The kings:</span> If so, what is this great noise we hear?</p></div>
<div class="indent3"><span class="nm">vii.</span><p><span class="cl">Bil'am:</span> He is giving to His children (Yisrael) a great treasure that has been hidden in His treasure-house 974 generations before He created the world - "Hash-m Oz l'Amo Yiten".</p></div>
<div class="indent3"><span class="nm">viii.</span><p><span class="cl">The kings:</span> "Hash-m Yevarech Es Amo ba'Shalom."</p></div>
<div class="indent2"><span class="nm">4.</span><p><span class="cl">Answer #3 (R. Eliezer):</span> He heard about Kri'as Yam Suf;</p></div>
<div class="indent3"><span class="nm">i.</span><p>It says, "va'Yhi chi'Shmo'a Kol Malchei ha'Emori (that Hash-m dried up the Yarden to enable Bnei Yisrael to pass...), and Rachav (who helped Pinchus and Kalev when Yehoshua sent them to spy out Eretz Yisrael) said "Shamanu Es Asher Hovish Hash-m Es Yam Suf..."</p></div>
<div class="indent2"><span class="nm">5.</span><p><span class="cl">Question:</span> The first verse (cited) continues "v'Lo Hayah Vam Od Ru'ach." Why does it say (differently) after the latter "v'Lo Kamah Od Ru'ach b'Ish"?</p></div>
<div class="bbbline">116b----------------------------------------116b</p></div>
<div class="indent2"><span class="nm">6.</span><p><span class="cl">Answer:</span> The men were so broken that they could not have an erection.</p></div>
<div class="indent2"><span class="nm">7.</span><p><span class="cl">Question:</span> How did Rachav know?</p></div>
<div class="indent2"><span class="nm">8.</span><p><span class="cl">Answer:</span> It was taught that every noble (in Eretz Yisrael at the time) had relations with her;</p></div>
<div class="indent3"><span class="nm">i.</span><p>She was a harlot at the age of 10 when Yisrael left Miztrayim. She had relations all 40 years that Yisrael were in the Midbar.</p></div>
<div class="indent3"><span class="nm">ii.</span><p>At the age of 50, she converted. She reasoned that the merit of saving the spies through the rope, window and flax (the Medrash replaces 'flax' with wall) would atone for having used these for Zenus.</p></div>

<div class="indent1"><span class="nm">(a)</span><p><span class="cl">(Beraisa (115b)):</span> (Even) nowadays, Nochrim may offer Korbanos on a Bamah.</p></div>
<div class="indent1"><span class="nm">(b)</span><p><span class="cl">Question:</span> What is the source of this?</p></div>
<div class="indent1"><span class="nm">(c)</span><p><span class="cl">Answer (Beraisa):</span> "Daber El Bnei Yisrael" - Shechutei Chutz is forbidden only to Yisrael. Nochrim may build Bamos and offer on them like they wish.</p></div>
<div class="indent1"><span class="nm">(d)</span><p><span class="cl">(R. Yakov bar Acha):</span> One may not help them (offer outside the Mikdash) or to be a Shali'ach for them.</p></div>
<div class="indent1"><span class="nm">(e)</span><p><span class="cl">(Rava):</span> One may teach them how to offer;</p></div>
<div class="indent2"><span class="nm">1.</span><p>The mother of Shevor Malka (the Persian king) sent a Korban for Rava to offer to Hash-m. Rava told Rav Safra and Rav Acha bar Huna to get two Nochri youths of the same age to offer it l'Shem Shamayim, where the sea deposits mud, using wood that was never used and a flame from new stones.</p></div>
<div class="indent1"><span class="nm">(f)</span><p><span class="cl">Question (Abaye):</span> You hold like R. Elazar ben Shamu'a;</p></div>
<div class="indent2"><span class="nm">1.</span><p><span class="cl">(Beraisa - R. Elazar ben Shamu'a):</span> Just like the Mizbe'ach was never used by a person (for Chulin), also the wood must not have been used before.</p></div>
<div class="indent2"><span class="nm">2.</span><p><span class="cl">Summation of question:</span> R. Elazar agrees that new wood is not needed when offering on a Bamah!</p></div>
<div class="indent3"><span class="nm">i.</span><p><span class="cl">(Beraisa) Contradiction:</span> When David bought Arnon's Goren (threshing floor) to build the Beis ha'Mikdash there, the verse says that he gave 600 golden Shekalim. Another verse says that he bought the Goren and cattle for 50 silver Shekalim!</p></div>
<div class="indent3"><span class="nm">ii.</span><p><span class="cl">Answer #1:</span> David collected from each Shevet a quantity of silver Shekalim worth 50 gold Shekalim. From all Yisrael this amounted to 600 gold Shekalim.</p></div>
<div class="indent3"><span class="nm">iii.</span><p><span class="cl">Answer #2 (Rebbi):</span> He paid 50 for the cattle, wood and place of the Mizbe'ach. He paid 600 for the place of the entire Beis ha'Mikdash.</p></div>
<div class="indent3"><span class="nm">iv.</span><p>R. Elazar ben Shamu'a says, we learn this from "ha'Bakar l'Olah veha'Morigim u'Chlei ha'Bakar la'Etzim." (Since they would be offered on a Bamah, used wood was acceptable!)</p></div>
<div class="indent1"><span class="nm">(g)</span><p><span class="cl">Answer (Rava):</span> The Kelim were new. (They had never been used.)</p></div>

<div class="indent1"><span class="nm">(k)</span><p><span class="cl">Answer (Abaye):</span> It is a wooden block with sharp grooves for threshing grain. We learn from "l'Morag Charutz Chadash Ba'al Pipiyos Tadush."</p></div>

<div class="indent1"><span class="nm">(a)</span><p><span class="cl">(Mishnah):</span> Kodshim Kalim were eaten within Machaneh Yisrael.</p></div>
<div class="indent1"><span class="nm">(b)</span><p><span class="cl">(Rav Huna):</span> They could be eaten wherever Yisrael were.</p></div>
<div class="indent1"><span class="nm">(c)</span><p><span class="cl">Question (Rav Nachman):</span> This implies that this was permitted even outside Machaneh Yisrael. This is wrong. There were (restrictions of) Machanos in the Midbar!</p></div>
<div class="indent2"><span class="nm">1.</span><p><span class="cl">(Beraisa):</span> Just like there were Machanos in the Midbar, there was a Machaneh in Yerushalayim;</p></div>
<div class="indent2"><span class="nm">2.</span><p>From Yerushalayim to Har ha'Bayis was Machaneh Yisrael. From Har ha'Bayis to Sha'ar Nikanor was Machaneh Levi. Past Sha'ar Nikanor was Machaneh Shechinah;</p></div>
<div class="indent2"><span class="nm">3.</span><p>Sha'ar Nikanor corresponds to the Kela'im (curtains around the Azarah) in the Midbar.</p></div>
<div class="indent1"><span class="nm">(d)</span><p><span class="cl">Correction:</span> Rav Huna meant that they could be eaten in all <i>places</i> (Rashi's text) of Machaneh Yisrael.

<div class="indent1"><span class="nm">(e)</span><p><span class="cl">Objection:</span> This is obvious!</p></div>
<div class="indent1"><span class="nm">(f)</span><p><span class="cl">Answer:</span> One might have thought that it is considered Yotzei (as if they left their place). Rav Huna teaches that this is not so.</p></div>
