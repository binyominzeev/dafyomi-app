<p class="bas subject"><span class="nm">1)</span>WHEN DOES <i>TACHAS</i> MAKE <i>TEMURAH</i>?</p>
<p class="bas indent1"><span class="nm">(a)</span><span class="cl">Answer (Abaye):</span> Tachas connotes both Hatpasah and Chilul (redemption);</p>
<p class="bas indent2"><span class="nm">1.</span>It connotes Hatpasah - "v'Im Tachteha Ta'amod ha'Baheres" (it is in place of it);</p>
<p class="bas indent2"><span class="nm">2.</span>It connotes Chilul - "Tachas ha'Nechoshes Avi Zahav."</p>
<p class="bas indent2"><span class="nm">3.</span>Regarding Kodshei Mizbe'ach, which make Temurah, surely he means Hatpasah;</p>
<p class="bas indent2"><span class="nm">4.</span>Regarding Bedek ha'Bayis, which do not make Temurah, surely he means Chilul.</p>
<p class="bas indent1"><span class="nm">(b)</span><span class="cl">(Rava):</span> Sometimes "Tachas" connotes Chilul even regarding Kodshei Mizbe'ach, i.e. if it is a Ba'al Mum (which must be redeemed. R. Gershom - Rava holds that the Seifa of the Mishnah "if it was a Ba'al Mum... " also applies to the Reisha, when he said "Tachas Zu".)</p>
<p class="bas indent1"><span class="nm">(c)</span><span class="cl">(Rav Ashi):</span> "Tachas" can connote Chilul or Hatpasah even regarding Kodshei Mizbe'ach;</p>
<p class="bas indent2"><span class="nm">1.</span>If he put his hand on the Kodesh animal, it means Chilul (he intends for the sake of that animal, to make it Chulin);</p>
<p class="bas indent2"><span class="nm">2.</span>If he put his hand on the Chulin animal, it means Hatpasah (he intends for the sake of that animal, to make it Kodesh).</p>
<p class="bas indent1"><span class="nm">(d)</span><span class="cl">Question #1 (Abaye):</span> If there were two Kodesh Ba'alei Mumim and two Tamim Chulin animals, and he said "Elu Tachas Elu" (and did not put his hands on any animal), what is the law?</p>
<p class="bas indent2"><span class="nm">1.</span>Does he mean Hatpasah, and he is lashed?</p>
<p class="bas indent2"><span class="nm">2.</span>Or, perhaps one does not sin unless he <i>must</i> (in order to get his desired result. Here, he has a permitted way to transfer Kedushah. Surely, he means Chilul!)</p>
<p class="bas indent1"><span class="nm">(e)</span><span class="cl">Question #2:</span> If you will say that one does not sin unless he must, if there were two Kodesh animals and two Chulin animals, and one of each (Kodesh and Chulin) was a Ba'al Mum and one was a Tam, and he said "Elu Tachas Elu," what is the law? (Surely, he is Matfis whichever animal is Tachas the Kodesh Tam, for Chilul applies only to a Ba'al Mum.)</p>
<p class="bas indent2"><span class="nm">1.</span>Does he Matfis the Tam in the Tam, and Mechalel the Ba'al Mum onto the Ba'al Mum? (Rashi - the latter cannot be Hatpasah, for Temurah applies only when at least one of the animals is Tam; Tosfos - Temurah applies even when both animals are Ba'alei Mumim, but surely he does not intend to be Matfis a Ba'al Mum, since it cannot be offered.)</p>
<p class="bas indent2"><span class="nm">2.</span>Or, is the Chulin Tam Tachas the Hekdesh Ba'al Mum, and the Chulin Ba'al Mum Tachas the Hekdesh Tam, and he is lashed twice? (In any case, the latter must be Hatpasah, so he transgresses at least once. Presumably, also the former is Hatpasah, since he did both of them in one word ("Tachas").)</p>
<p class="bas indent1"><span class="nm">(f)</span><span class="cl">Question #3:</span> If you will say that (even then,) one does not sin unless he must, if there were three Kodesh animals, i.e. two Tamim and a Ba'al Mum, and three Chulin Tamim, and he said "Elu Tachas Elu," what is the law?</p>
<p class="bas indent2"><span class="nm">1.</span>Since for the majority of these three transactions, "Tachas" (perforce) refers to Hatpasah, also for the third;</p>
<p class="bas indent2"><span class="nm">2.</span>Or, even here, one does not sin (regarding the Hekdesh Ba'al Mum) unless he must!</p>
<p class="bas indent1"><span class="nm">(g)</span><span class="cl">Question #4 (Rav Ashi):</span> If you will say that (even then, we assume that) one does not sin unless he must, perhaps this is because he is not Muchzak to sin (three times). If there were four Kodesh animals, i.e. three Tamim and a Ba'al Mum, and four Chulin animals, and he said "Elu Tachas Elu," what is the law?</p>
<p class="bas indent2"><span class="nm">1.</span>Since he sins (at least) three times, he is Muchzak, so he is Matfis also the Ba'al Mum, so he is lashed four times;</p>
<p class="bas indent2"><span class="nm">2.</span>Or, even though he is Muchzak, he does not sin when he need not. He is Mechalel the Ba'al Mum!</p>
<p class="bas indent1"><span class="nm">(h)</span>These questions are not resolved.</p>
<p class="bas subject"><span class="nm">2)</span><i>ONA'AH</i> OF <i>HEKDESH</i></p>
<p class="bas indent1"><span class="nm">(a)</span><span class="cl">(Mishnah):</span> If the Hekdesh animal was a Ba'al Mum, it becomes Chulin...</p>
<p class="bas indent1"><span class="nm">(b)</span><span class="cl">(R. Yochanan):</span> It becomes Chulin mid'Oraisa. Mid'Rabanan, he must compensate (if the Chulin is worth less.)</p>
<p class="bas indent1"><span class="nm">(c)</span><span class="cl">(Reish Lakish):</span> Mid'Oraisa he must compensate.</p>
<p class="bas indent1"><span class="nm">(d)</span><span class="cl">Question:</span> What is the case?</p>
<p class="bas indent2"><span class="nm">1.</span>If there is (a Shi'ur of) Ona'ah (the Hekdesh is worth a sixth more than the Chulin), Reish Lakish would not say that mid'Oraisa he must compensate!</p>
<p class="bas indent2"><span class="nm">2.</span><span class="cl">(Mishnah):</span> Ona'ah does not apply to the following: slaves, documents, land, and Hekdesh.</p>
<p class="bas indent1"><span class="nm">(e)</span><span class="cl">Answer #1:</span> Rather, there is (a Shi'ur of) Bitul Mekach. (The Hekdesh is worth more than a sixth more than the Chulin).</p>
<p class="bas indent1"><span class="nm">(f)</span><span class="cl">Objection:</span> If so, R. Yochanan would not say that (mid'Oraisa it is Chulin, just) mid'Rabanan he must compensate!</p>
<p class="bas bbbline">27b----------------------------------------27b</p>
<p class="bas indent2"><span class="nm">1.</span><span class="cl">(R. Yirmeyah citing R. Yochanan):</span> Ona'ah does not apply to land, but Bitul Mekach applies.</p>
<p class="bas indent2"><span class="nm">2.</span><span class="cl">(R. Yonah citing R. Yochanan):</span> Ona'ah does not apply to Hekdesh, but Bitul Mekach applies.</p>
<p class="bas indent1"><span class="nm">(g)</span><span class="cl">Answer:</span> Really, there is a Shi'ur of Bitul Mekach. The opinions of R. Yochanan and Reish Lakish must be switched.</p>
<p class="bas indent1"><span class="nm">(h)</span><span class="cl">Objection:</span> We cannot switch the opinions!</p>
<p class="bas indent2"><span class="nm">1.</span>We could switched according to R. Yonah, who says that there is Bitul Mekach regarding Hekdesh, and all the more so regarding land;</p>
<p class="bas indent2"><span class="nm">2.</span>However, according to R. Yirmeyah, who says that there is Bitul Mekach regarding land, but not regarding Hekdesh, we cannot switch the opinions!</p>
<p class="bas indent2"><span class="nm">3.</span><span class="cl">Suggestion:</span> R. Yochanan and Reish Lakish argue about Shmuel's law: (We adopt Hagahos ha'Gra's text. It is like Rashi and the Gemara in Bava Metzia.)</p>
<p class="bas indent3"><span class="nm">i.</span><span class="cl">(Shmuel):</span> If Hekdesh of any value was redeemed onto something worth a Perutah, it takes effect.</p>
<p class="bas indent3"><span class="nm">ii.</span>R. Yochanan holds like Shmuel (therefore, mid'Oraisa no compensation is necessary), and Reish Lakish argues with Shmuel.</p>
<p class="bas indent2"><span class="nm">4.</span><span class="cl">Rejection:</span> No, all agree with Shmuel;</p>
<p class="bas indent3"><span class="nm">i.</span><span class="cl">Version #1 (our text, Tosfos):</span> R. Yonah holds (that R. Yochanan says) that Shmuel's law applies only b'Di'eved (if he did something forbidden, i.e. he knew that the Chulin is worth less. If he did not know, we assume that he did not want to shortchange Hekdesh, so he must compensate);</p>
<p class="bas indent3"><span class="nm">ii.</span>R. Yirmeyah holds that Shmuel's law is l'Chatchilah. (He thought that the Chulin is worth as much as the Hekdesh.)</p>
<p class="bas indent3"><span class="nm">iii.</span><span class="cl">Version #2 (Rashi):</span> Reish Lakish holds that Shmuel's law applies only if he intended (to be Mechalel the Hekdesh on Chulin that is worth less. If not, he must compensate);</p>
<p class="bas indent3"><span class="nm">iv.</span>R. Yochanan holds that Shmuel's law always applies (even if the Chulin is worth less).</p>
<p class="bas indent1"><span class="nm">(i)</span><span class="cl">Answer #2 (to Question (d)):</span> We do not switch the opinions. Really, there is Ona'ah;</p>
<p class="bas indent2"><span class="nm">1.</span>Before, we asked that Reish Lakish must agree with the Mishnah that Ona'ah does not apply to Hekdesh. He can answer like Rav Chisda;</p>
<p class="bas indent3"><span class="nm">i.</span><span class="cl">(Rav Chisda):</span> The Mishnah means that the <i>Shi'ur of</i> Ona'ah does not apply to Hekdesh. (Hekdesh does not "pardon" any shortchanging. Even if it is less than a sixth, one must compensate.)</p>
<p class="bas indent3"><span class="nm">ii.</span><span class="cl">(Ula):</span> This is only if the redemption was according to (at most) two people (who estimated its value). If it was according to three, even if 100 later give a different estimation, the redemption stands.</p>
<p class="bas indent3"><span class="nm">iii.</span><span class="cl">Objection #1:</span> Rav Safra taught that two are like 100 only regarding testimony, but we follow the majority of opinions regarding appraisal!</p>
<p class="bas indent3"><span class="nm">iv.</span><span class="cl">Objection #2:</span> Even if three appraised it the first time, if three others later gave a higher estimation, we follow the latter, for Hekdesh has the upper hand!</p>
<p class="bas indent3"><span class="nm">v.</span><span class="cl">Answer:</span> Ula holds that the obligation to compensate Hekdesh is only mid'Rabanan, therefore Chachamim were lenient about it.</p>
<p class="bas subject"><span class="nm">3)</span>WHICH WORDS MAKE <i>TEMURAH</i></p>
<p class="bas indent1"><span class="nm">(a)</span><span class="cl">(Mishnah):</span> If one said "this is Tachas Olah" or "Tachas Chatas" (and no Olah or Chatas was present), nothing takes effect;</p>
<p class="bas indent1"><span class="nm">(b)</span>If one said "this is Tachas this Olah" or "Tachas this Chatas" or "Tachas the Olah or Chatas in my house," it takes effect.</p>
<p class="bas indent1"><span class="nm">(c)</span>If one said about a Tamei Behemah or Ba'al Mum "it is an Olah," nothing takes effect;</p>
<p class="bas indent1"><span class="nm">(d)</span>If he said 'it is <i>l</i>'Olah (<i>for</i> an Olah)', it is sold, and we bring an Olah with the money.</p>
<p class="bas indent1"><span class="nm">(e)</span><span class="cl">(Gemara - Rav Yehudah):</span> Our Mishnah is unlike R. Meir, who says that one does not say vain words. (Tosfos - R. Meir would say that surely he meant "Tachas the Olah or Chatas in my house.")</p>
<p class="bas indent1"><span class="nm">(f)</span><span class="cl">(Mishnah):</span> If he said 'it is l'Olah', it is sold, and we bring Olah with the money.</p>
<p class="bas indent1"><span class="nm">(g)</span><span class="cl">Inference:</span> The Mishnah discusses a Tamei animal or Ba'al Mum, which may never be offered, therefore it may be sold immediately. However, if one was Makdish a female for an Asham or Olah, since females are valid for other Korbanos, it may not be sold without a Mum.</p>
<p class="bas indent1"><span class="nm">(h)</span><span class="cl">(Rav Yehudah):</span> Our Mishnah is unlike R. Shimon:</p>
<p class="bas indent2"><span class="nm">1.</span><span class="cl">(Mishnah - R. Shimon):</span> If one was Makdish a female for an Asham or Olah, it may be sold without a Mum.</p>
