<p class="bas subject"><span class="nm">1)</span>ACQUIRING ON BEHALF OF CREDITORS</p>
<p class="bas indent1"><span class="nm">(a)</span><span class="cl">Objection #1 (Ameimar):</span> Perhaps all agree that one who seizes property from a borrower on behalf of a creditor does not acquire for him when this harms others;</p>
<p class="bas indent2"><span class="nm">1.</span>R. Eliezer holds that Migo (since) Levi could make his property Hefker (and he would be an Oni, who may take Pe'ah), even when he is rich, Pe'ah befits him;</p>
<p class="bas indent2"><span class="nm">2.</span>Since he could acquire Pe'ah for himself, he may acquire it for an Oni.</p>
<p class="bas indent1"><span class="nm">(b)</span><span class="cl">Objection #2 (Ameimar):</span> Perhaps all agree that one who seizes for a creditor acquires, even when this harms others;</p>
<p class="bas indent2"><span class="nm">1.</span>Chachamim expound that one cannot acquire Pe'ah for an Oni from "do not gather, for an Oni (you will leave it)." We read this "do not gather for an Oni."</p>
<p class="bas indent2"><span class="nm">2.</span><span class="cl">Question:</span> How does R. Eliezer expound this?</p>
<p class="bas indent2"><span class="nm">3.</span><span class="cl">Answer:</span> This forbids a poor man to gather Pe'ah from his own field.</p>
<p class="bas subject"><span class="nm">2)</span>MUST ONE FEED HIS SLAVE?</p>
<p class="bas indent1"><span class="nm">(a)</span><span class="cl">(Mishnah):</span> If a man does not want to feed...</p>
<p class="bas indent1"><span class="nm">(b)</span><span class="cl">Inference:</span> One can tell his (Kena'ani) slave 'work for me and I will not feed you,'</p>
<p class="bas indent1"><span class="nm">(c)</span><span class="cl">Rejection:</span> No. The case is, the master told him 'feed yourself from your earnings.'</p>
<p class="bas indent1"><span class="nm">(d)</span><span class="cl">Question:</span> The corresponding case of his wife would be that he told her 'feed yourself from your earnings.' Why is he obligated to feed his wife?</p>
<p class="bas indent1"><span class="nm">(e)</span><span class="cl">Answer:</span> The case is, her earnings do not suffice for her food.</p>
<p class="bas indent1"><span class="nm">(f)</span><span class="cl">Question:</span> We should say that it likewise discusses a slave whose earnings do not suffice for his food!</p>
<p class="bas indent1"><span class="nm">(g)</span><span class="cl">Answer:</span> One need not feed a slave who eats more than the value of his work.</p>
<p class="bas indent1"><span class="nm">(h)</span><span class="cl">(Beraisa):</span> If a slave was exiled to a refuge city (for killing b'Shogeg), his master need not feed him, but his earnings go to his master.</p>
<p class="bas indent1"><span class="nm">(i)</span><span class="cl">Inference:</span> One can tell his slave 'work for me and I will not feed you.'</p>
<p class="bas indent1"><span class="nm">(j)</span><span class="cl">Rejection:</span> No. The case is, the master told him 'feed yourself from your earnings.'</p>
<p class="bas indent1"><span class="nm">(k)</span><span class="cl">Question:</span> If so, why does the Beraisa say that his earnings go to his master?</p>
<p class="bas indent1"><span class="nm">(l)</span><span class="cl">Answer:</span> The excess earnings (above the cost of his food) go to his master.</p>
<p class="bas indent1"><span class="nm">(m)</span><span class="cl">Question:</span> This is obvious!</p>
<p class="bas indent1"><span class="nm">(n)</span><span class="cl">Answer:</span> One might have thought that since the master does not give the slave at times when the slave lacks, he does not take from the slave when the slave has extra. The Beraisa teaches that this is not so.</p>
<p class="bas indent1"><span class="nm">(o)</span><span class="cl">Question:</span> If the law is always true, why does the Beraisa discuss a slave in exile?</p>
<p class="bas indent1"><span class="nm">(p)</span><span class="cl">Answer:</span> It says about one in exile "he will live." One might have thought that one must take extra efforts to ensure his livelihood. The Beraisa teaches that this is not so.</p>
<p class="bas subject"><span class="nm">3)</span>ONE MUST FEED A WIFE IN EXILE</p>
<p class="bas indent1"><span class="nm">(a)</span><span class="cl">Question (Seifa):</span> If a wife was exiled to a refuge city, her husband must feed her.</p>
<p class="bas indent2"><span class="nm">1.</span>We must say that he did not tell her to feed herself from her earnings.</p>
<p class="bas indent2"><span class="nm">2.</span>Just like in the Seifa he did not tell her, also in the Reisha he did not tell his slave!</p>
<p class="bas indent1"><span class="nm">(b)</span><span class="cl">Answer:</span> Really, he told them. He must feed his wife when she cannot feed herself from her earnings.</p>
<p class="bas indent1"><span class="nm">(c)</span><span class="cl">Question (Seifa):</span> If he told his wife to feed herself from her earnings, he is allowed.</p>
<p class="bas indent2"><span class="nm">1.</span><span class="cl">Inference:</span> In the previous clause he did not say this!</p>
<p class="bas indent1"><span class="nm">(d)</span><span class="cl">Answer:</span> The Beraisa says thusly: if she earns enough to feed herself, he can tell her to feed herself from her earnings.</p>
<p class="bas indent1"><span class="nm">(e)</span><span class="cl">Question:</span> If she can earn enough, this is obvious!</p>
<p class="bas indent1"><span class="nm">(f)</span><span class="cl">Answer:</span> One might have thought that due to "the honor of the king's daughter is (to stay) inside", she need not work and he must feed her. The Beraisa teaches that this is not so.</p>
<p class="bas subject"><span class="nm">4)</span>MUST ONE FEED HIS SLAVE?</p>
<p class="bas indent1"><span class="nm">(a)</span><span class="cl">Suggestion:</span> Tana'im argue about whether or not a master can tell his slave 'work for me and I will not feed you':</p>
<p class="bas indent2"><span class="nm">1.</span><span class="cl">(Beraisa - R. Shimon ben Gamliel):</span> In years of famine, a slave can tell his master, 'feed me or free me';</p>
<p class="bas indent2"><span class="nm">2.</span>Chachamim say, the master need not comply;</p>
<p class="bas indent2"><span class="nm">3.</span><span class="cl">Suggestion:</span> Chachamim hold that a master can say 'work for me and I will not feed you', and R. Shimon says that he cannot.</p>
<p class="bas indent1"><span class="nm">(b)</span><span class="cl">Rejection #1:</span> If so, (according to R. Shimon) why does the slave request food or freedom? His claim should be 'feed me or give me my earnings towards my food'!</p>
<p class="bas indent1"><span class="nm">(c)</span><span class="cl">Rejection #2:</span> If so, why does the Beraisa discuss specifically famine years?</p>
<p class="bas indent1"><span class="nm">(d)</span>Rather, (all agree that one cannot tell his slave 'work for me and I will not feed you'). The case is, his master said 'feed yourself from your earnings.' In famine years, the slave's earnings do not suffice;</p>
<p class="bas indent2"><span class="nm">1.</span>R. Shimon ben Gamliel holds that if he will not feed him, he must free him, so people will have mercy on him and feed him.</p>
<p class="bas indent2"><span class="nm">2.</span>Chachamim hold that whoever has mercy to feed a free man will also have mercy to feed a slave.</p>
<p class="bas indent1"><span class="nm">(e)</span><span class="cl">(Rav):</span> If one makes Hekdesh his slave's hands, the slave borrows money for food, and pays up the debt through his earnings.</p>
<p class="bas indent1"><span class="nm">(f)</span><span class="cl">Inference:</span> One can tell his slave 'work for me and I will not feed you.'</p>
<p class="bas indent1"><span class="nm">(g)</span><span class="cl">Rejection:</span> No. The case is, his master is feeding him.</p>
<p class="bas indent1"><span class="nm">(h)</span><span class="cl">Question:</span> If so, why does the slave borrow to eat?</p>
<p class="bas bbbline">12b----------------------------------------12b</p>
<p class="bas indent1"><span class="nm">(i)</span><span class="cl">Answer:</span> He borrows for extra food.</p>
<p class="bas indent1"><span class="nm">(j)</span><span class="cl">Question:</span> (The treasurer of) Hekdesh should tell him 'until now, you managed with standard rations. Now also, that suffices for you!'</p>
<p class="bas indent1"><span class="nm">(k)</span><span class="cl">Answer:</span> It is beneficial for Hekdesh that he eats extra, for this will increase his value.</p>
<p class="bas indent1"><span class="nm">(l)</span><span class="cl">Question:</span> How can he pay his debt through his earnings? Every bit of money he earns becomes Hekdesh immediately!</p>
<p class="bas indent1"><span class="nm">(m)</span><span class="cl">Answer:</span> He pays from his earnings bit by bit, before his earnings accumulate to a Perutah.</p>
<p class="bas indent1"><span class="nm">(n)</span><span class="cl">Support:</span> We must say that the case is that the master is feeding him (to answer a contradiction in Rav).</p>
<p class="bas indent2"><span class="nm">1.</span><span class="cl">Contradiction (Rav):</span> If one makes his slave's hands Hekdesh, the slave works and eats what he earns. If he will not work, who will feed him?!</p>
<p class="bas indent2"><span class="nm">2.</span><span class="cl">Resolution:</span> In the former teaching, the master feeds him. In this teaching, he does not.</p>
<p class="bas indent1"><span class="nm">(o)</span><span class="cl">Question:</span> If in the first teaching, the master does not feed him, because a master can say 'work for me and I will not feed you', why does the second teaching say, 'who will feed him'? Whoever wants to will feed him (we are not concerned)!</p>
<p class="bas indent1"><span class="nm">(p)</span><span class="cl">Answer:</span> We must say that Rav holds that he cannot say 'work for me and I will not feed you,'</p>
<p class="bas subject"><span class="nm">5)</span>PAYING FOR DAMAGING A SLAVE</p>
<p class="bas indent1"><span class="nm">(a)</span><span class="cl">(R. Yochanan):</span> If Reuven cut off the hand of Shimon's slave, Reuven compensates Shimon for the loss of earnings and the medical expenses. The slave is fed from Tzedakah.</p>
<p class="bas indent1"><span class="nm">(b)</span><span class="cl">Inference:</span> R. Yochanan holds that a master can say 'work for me and I will not feed you.'</p>
<p class="bas indent1"><span class="nm">(c)</span><span class="cl">Rejection:</span> No. The case is, the master is feeding him.</p>
<p class="bas indent1"><span class="nm">(d)</span><span class="cl">Question:</span> If so, why is the slave fed from Tzedakah?</p>
<p class="bas indent1"><span class="nm">(e)</span><span class="cl">Answer:</span> This is for extra food.</p>
<p class="bas indent1"><span class="nm">(f)</span><span class="cl">Objection:</span> If so, it should say he is financed from Tzedakah!</p>
<p class="bas indent1"><span class="nm">(g)</span><span class="cl">Conclusion:</span> Our inference was correct. R. Yochanan holds that a master can say 'work for me and I will not feed you.'</p>
<p class="bas indent1"><span class="nm">(h)</span><span class="cl">Question:</span> Why did R. Yochanan say that Shimon receives the compensation for the loss of earnings and the medical expenses? Obviously, he gets the compensation for the loss of earnings!</p>
<p class="bas indent1"><span class="nm">(i)</span><span class="cl">Answer:</span> Indeed, it was merely taught along with the medical expenses.</p>
<p class="bas indent1"><span class="nm">(j)</span><span class="cl">Question:</span> The medical expenses should go to the slave. He must heal himself!</p>
<p class="bas indent1"><span class="nm">(k)</span><span class="cl">Answer:</span> The case is, the doctors estimated that he needs five days of treatment; they gave him a potent (but painful) drug that healed him in three days.</p>
<p class="bas indent2"><span class="nm">1.</span>One might have thought that the savings goes to the slave, since it came through his pain. R. Yochanan teaches that it goes to the master.</p>
<p class="bas subject"><span class="nm">6)</span>DOES A SLAVE BENEFIT BY GOING FREE?</p>
<p class="bas indent1"><span class="nm">(a)</span><span class="cl">(Beraisa - R. Elazar):</span> We told R. Meir that a slave benefits by going free!</p>
<p class="bas indent2"><span class="nm">1.</span><span class="cl">R. Meir:</span> No, it is disadvantageous for him. If his master was a Kohen, freedom disqualifies him from eating Terumah.</p>
<p class="bas indent2"><span class="nm">2.</span><span class="cl">Chachamim:</span> The master can say that he will not feed him!</p>
<p class="bas indent2"><span class="nm">3.</span><span class="cl">R. Meir:</span> A Kohen's slave who fled, or a Kohen's wife who rebels on him, may eat Terumah, but a freed slave may not!</p>
<p class="bas indent3"><span class="nm">i.</span>But it is disadvantageous for a wife to be divorced, for she is disqualified from Terumah and ceases to be fed.</p>
<p class="bas indent1"><span class="nm">(b)</span><span class="cl">Question:</span> How do we understand this dialogue between R. Meir and Chachamim?</p>
<p class="bas indent1"><span class="nm">(c)</span><span class="cl">Answer:</span> R. Meir admitted 'you refuted my proof from food. What can you answer about Terumah?'</p>
<p class="bas indent2"><span class="nm">1.</span><span class="cl">Suggestion:</span> The master could throw a Get at the slave (and free him against his will), and disqualify him from Terumah.</p>
<p class="bas indent2"><span class="nm">2.</span><span class="cl">Rejection:</span> The slave could run away!</p>
<p class="bas indent3"><span class="nm">i.</span>A Kohen's slave who fled, or a Kohen's wife who rebels, may eat Terumah, but a freed slave may not!</p>
<p class="bas indent2"><span class="nm">3.</span><span class="cl">Question:</span> R. Meir's argument is sound. Why didn't Chachamim agree?</p>
<p class="bas indent2"><span class="nm">4.</span><span class="cl">Answer (Rava):</span> The Mishnah records their answer, because he is the money of the Kohen. His master may sell him to a Yisrael for a small amount and disqualify the slave from Terumah, wherever the slave is.</p>
