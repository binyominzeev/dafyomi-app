<p class="bas subject"><span class="nm">1)</span>WHAT ARE CONSIDERED <i>YERAKOS</i>?</p>
<p class="bas indent1"><span class="nm">(a)</span><span class="cl">(Mishnah):</span> If one vowed from Yerakos, he may have gourd;</p>
<p class="bas indent1"><span class="nm">(b)</span>R. Akiva forbids.</p>
<p class="bas indent2"><span class="nm">1.</span><span class="cl">Chachamim:</span> If a Shali'ach was sent to the market to buy Yerakos (and found only gourds), he will say 'I didn't find Yerakos, only gourds!'</p>
<p class="bas indent2"><span class="nm">2.</span><span class="cl">R. Akiva:</span> Yes! He would not say 'I found only legumes!'</p>
<p class="bas indent3"><span class="nm">i.</span>This is because gourds are in the category of Yerakos. Legumes are not.</p>
<p class="bas indent1"><span class="nm">(c)</span>He may have dry Mitzri beans, but not moist.</p>
<p class="bas indent1"><span class="nm">(d)</span><span class="cl">(Gemara) Question:</span> He vowed from Yerakos. How can R. Akiva forbid gourds?</p>
<p class="bas indent1"><span class="nm">(e)</span><span class="cl">Answer (Ula):</span> The case is, he vowed from pot Yerakos. (The extra word shows that he wants to forbid something else as well.)</p>
<p class="bas indent1"><span class="nm">(f)</span><span class="cl">Question:</span> Maybe he meant to include Yerakos eaten in a pot (i.e. that are added for flavor)!</p>
<p class="bas indent1"><span class="nm">(g)</span><span class="cl">Answer:</span> He vowed from Yerakos cooked in a pot.</p>
<p class="bas indent1"><span class="nm">(h)</span><span class="cl">Question:</span> What do Chachamim and R. Akiva argue about?</p>
<p class="bas indent1"><span class="nm">(i)</span><span class="cl">Answer:</span> Chachamim hold that anything a Shali'ach must ask about is not included in the species;</p>
<p class="bas indent1"><span class="nm">(j)</span>R. Akiva holds that it is.</p>
<p class="bas indent2"><span class="nm">1.</span><span class="cl">(Abaye):</span> R. Akiva agrees that one is not lashed for eating things that a Shali'ach would ask about.</p>
<p class="bas subject"><span class="nm">2)</span>WHAT IS CONSIDERED MEAT?</p>
<p class="bas indent1"><span class="nm">(a)</span><span class="cl">(Mishnah):</span> If a Shali'ach (was sent to buy something with money that was Hekdesh and he) fulfilled his mission, the sender transgresses Me'ilah. If he did not fulfill his mission (e.g. he bought the wrong item), he himself transgresses Me'ilah.</p>
<p class="bas indent1"><span class="nm">(b)</span><span class="cl">Question:</span> Who is the Tana of the Mishnah?</p>
<p class="bas indent1"><span class="nm">(c)</span><span class="cl">Answer (Rav Chisda):</span> It is unlike R. Akiva:</p>
<p class="bas indent2"><span class="nm">1.</span><span class="cl">(Seifa):</span> If a man told his servant 'give meat to the guests', and he gave liver (or vice-versa, and what he gave was Hekdesh), the servant transgressed Me'ilah.</p>
<p class="bas indent2"><span class="nm">2.</span>A Shali'ach would ask if he should get liver in place of meat, so according to R. Akiva he fulfilled the mission. If so, the sender transgresses, not the Shali'ach!</p>
<p class="bas indent1"><span class="nm">(d)</span><span class="cl">Rejection (Abaye):</span> The Mishnah can be like R. Akiva. R. Akiva admits that the Shali'ach must consult! (Therefore, we do not say that he fulfilled his mission.)</p>

<p class="bas indent1"><span class="nm">(e)</span><span class="cl">Rava:</span> Abaye is correct.</p>
<p class="bas indent1"><span class="nm">(f)</span>The Chachamim who argue with R. Akiva hold like R. Shimon ben Gamliel:</p>
<p class="bas indent2"><span class="nm">1.</span><span class="cl">(Beraisa):</span> If one vowed from meat, all types of meat (e.g. cattle, flock and Chayos) are forbidden. He is forbidden (even) the head, legs, windpipe, liver, heart, and fowl. He may eat fish and grasshoppers;</p>
<p class="bas indent2"><span class="nm">2.</span>R. Shimon ben Gamliel forbids all types of meat, but permits the head, legs, windpipe, liver, heart, and fowl. All the more so, he permits fish and grasshoppers.</p>
<p class="bas indent3"><span class="nm">i.</span><span class="cl">(R. Shimon ben Gamliel):</span> The innards are not considered meat. One who eats them is not a person.</p>
<p class="bas indent3"><span class="nm">ii.</span><span class="cl">Question:</span> In what respect is he not a person?</p>
<p class="bas indent3"><span class="nm">iii.</span><span class="cl">Answer:</span> If he buys them in place of meat, he is not a (distinguished) person.</p>
<p class="bas indent1"><span class="nm">(g)</span><span class="cl">Question:</span> Why does the first Tana forbid fowl, and permit fish? A Shali'ach would consult before buying either!</p>
<p class="bas indent1"><span class="nm">(h)</span><span class="cl">Answer #1 (Abaye):</span> The case is, the one who vowed just underwent bloodletting (therefore, he had no intention to eat fish anyway, for it is dangerous, so he didn't intend to forbid it).</p>
<p class="bas indent1"><span class="nm">(i)</span><span class="cl">Objection:</span> If so, the same should apply to fowl!</p>
<p class="bas indent2"><span class="nm">1.</span><span class="cl">(Shmuel):</span> If one eats fowl after letting blood from the shoulder, his heart will flutter like a bird.</p>
<p class="bas indent2"><span class="nm">2.</span><span class="cl">(Beraisa):</span> We do not let blood after the patient ate fish, fowl or salted meat;</p>
<p class="bas indent3"><span class="nm">i.</span><span class="cl">(Beraisa):</span> After letting blood, the patient should not eat cheese, milk, eggs, leeks, fowl or salted meat.</p>
<p class="bas indent2"><span class="nm">3.</span><span class="cl">Answer:</span> He had fowl in mind, since if he overcooks it, it will not harm him.</p>
<p class="bas indent1"><span class="nm">(j)</span><span class="cl">Answer #2 (Rava):</span> His eyes were hurting when he vowed. (Fish harms the eyes, so he did not intend to eat fish anyway, and didn't intend to forbid them.)</p>
<p class="bas indent1"><span class="nm">(k)</span><span class="cl">Question:</span> To the contrary! Shmuel taught that fish are a remedy for the eyes!</p>
<p class="bas indent1"><span class="nm">(l)</span><span class="cl">Answer:</span> They are helpful only at the end of the sickness.</p>
