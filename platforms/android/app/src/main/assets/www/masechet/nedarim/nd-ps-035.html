<p class="bas subject"><span class="nm">1)</span>GIVING TO ONE WHO MAY NOT GET BENEFIT</p>
<p class="bas indent1"><span class="nm">(a)</span><span class="cl">Question (against Rava - Beraisa):</span> If Levi asked Shimon 'Lend to me your cow (or axe)' and Shimon responded 'my cow (or axe, or my property) is forbidden to you if I own another one':</p>
<p class="bas indent2"><span class="nm">1.</span>If it was found that Shimon owned another; his cow (or axe or property) is forbidden to Levi in Shimon's lifetime. If Shimon died or it was given to Levi for a gift, it is permitted.</p>
<p class="bas indent1"><span class="nm">(b)</span><span class="cl">Answer (Rav Acha brei d'Rav Ika):</span> Shimon gave it to someone else, and that person to Levi.</p>
<p class="bas indent1"><span class="nm">(c)</span><span class="cl">Support (Rav Ashi):</span> The Beraisa says 'Nitnu' (it was given) to him, not 'Nasno' (he gave it).</p>
<p class="bas subject"><span class="nm">2)</span>DOES <i>ME'ILAH</i> APPLY TO <i>KONAMOS</i>?</p>
<p class="bas indent1"><span class="nm">(a)</span><span class="cl">Question (Rava):</span> If one transgressed a Konam (a vow forbidding an object like Hekdesh), did he transgress Me'ilah?</p>
<p class="bas indent1"><span class="nm">(b)</span><span class="cl">Answer #1 (Rav Nachman - Mishnah):</span> In a place where people receive money for returning an Aveidah, this amount is given to Hekdesh.</p>
<p class="bas indent2"><span class="nm">1.</span>(We do not say that the money should be thrown to the sea.) This suggests that Konamos are like Hekdesh. Just like Me'ilah applies to Hekdesh, it applies to Konamos.</p>
<p class="bas indent1"><span class="nm">(c)</span><span class="cl">Answer #2:</span> Tana'im argue about this:</p>
<p class="bas indent2"><span class="nm">1.</span><span class="cl">(Beraisa - R. Meir):</span> If one said 'Konam, this loaf is Hekdesh', anyone who eats it transgresses Me'ilah. Therefore, the loaf can be redeemed;</p>
<p class="bas indent2"><span class="nm">2.</span>If one said 'Konam, this loaf is to me Hekdesh' and he eats it, he transgresses Me'ilah. If anyone else eats it he does not transgresses Me'ilah, therefore it cannot be redeemed;</p>
<p class="bas indent2"><span class="nm">3.</span>Chachamim say that in either case there is no Me'ilah. Me'ilah never applies to Konamos.</p>
<p class="bas indent1"><span class="nm">(d)</span><span class="cl">Question (Rav Acha brei d'Rav Avya):</span> If Reuven said to Shimon 'my loaf is forbidden to you', and then Reuven gave it to Shimon (who did not know that it was forbidden), who transgresses Me'ilah?</p>
<p class="bas indent2"><span class="nm">1.</span>Reuven does not, for it is not forbidden to him!</p>
<p class="bas indent2"><span class="nm">2.</span>Shimon does not, for he can say that he accepted only what is permitted, not what is forbidden!</p>
<p class="bas indent1"><span class="nm">(e)</span><span class="cl">Answer (Rav Ashi):</span> Shimon transgresses when he will give it to someone else.</p>
<p class="bas indent2"><span class="nm">1.</span>Anyone who transfers ownership of Hekdesh, thinking that it is Chulin, transgresses Me'ilah. This applies to Shimon!</p>

<p class="bas subject"><span class="nm">3)</span>ARE KOHANIM SHLUCHIM OF YISRAEL?</p>
<p class="bas indent1"><span class="nm">(a)</span><span class="cl">(Mishnah):</span> (If Simchah is Mudar Hana'ah from Reuven,) Reuven may separate Terumah and Ma'aser for Simchah with Simchah's knowledge. (If Reuven is a Kohen,) he may offer for Simchah bird-offerings of a Zav or Zavah or a woman who gave birth, Chata'os and Ashamos;</p>
<p class="bas indent1"><span class="nm">(b)</span>Reuven may teach to Simchah Medrash, laws and Agadeta (non-Halachic teachings), but not written Torah.</p>
<p class="bas indent2"><span class="nm">1.</span>He may teach written Torah to Simchah's children.</p>
<p class="bas indent1"><span class="nm">(c)</span><span class="cl">(Gemara) Question:</span> Are Kohanim (serving in the Mikdash) Sheluchim (agents) on behalf of us (Yisraelim), or on behalf of Hash-m?</p>
<p class="bas indent2"><span class="nm">1.</span>This affects the law of a Yisrael who is Mudar Hana'ah from a Kohen:</p>
<p class="bas indent3"><span class="nm">i.</span>If they are our Sheluchim, a Kohen may not offer Korbanos for the Yisrael;</p>
<p class="bas indent3"><span class="nm">ii.</span>If they are Hash-m's Sheluchim, the Kohen may offer the Yisrael's Korbanos.</p>
<p class="bas indent1"><span class="nm">(d)</span><span class="cl">Answer (Mishnah):</span> Reuven may offer for him bird-offerings of a Zav...</p>
<p class="bas indent2"><span class="nm">1.</span>If he is Simchah's Shali'ach, he benefits him!</p>
<p class="bas indent1"><span class="nm">(e)</span><span class="cl">Objection:</span> If he is a Shali'ach of Hash-m, the Mishnah should have said that he can offer for him (all) Korbanos!</p>
<p class="bas indent2"><span class="nm">1.</span>Rather, we must say that Mechusar Kipurim (Korbanos that certain Tamei people must bring before eating Kodshim) are different.</p>
<p class="bas indent2"><span class="nm">2.</span><span class="cl">(R. Yochanan):</span> Any Korban brought for Levi must be brought with Levi's consent. The only exceptions are Mechusar Kipurim, for a man brings them for his minor children (even though a child cannot bring for himself. We learn that the same applies to people who could bring for themselves);</p>
<p class="bas indent3"><span class="nm">i.</span>"Zos Toras (this is the law of) ha'Zav" - (a Korban is required) whether he is an adult or minor.</p>
<p class="bas indent1"><span class="nm">(f)</span><span class="cl">Question:</span> If so, R. Yochanan should also expound "Zos Toras ha'Yoledes" to apply whether she is an adult or minor. A minor cannot give birth!</p>
<p class="bas indent2"><span class="nm">1.</span><span class="cl">(Rav Bivi - Beraisa):</span> Three women use a wad to prevent pregnancy: a minor, a pregnant woman, and a nursing woman. (Rashi Yevamos 12b - they <i>may</i> use a contraceptive wad at the time of Bi'ah. Tosfos - this is forbidden! Rather, they <i>must</i> use a wad <i>after</i> Bi'ah to remove the semen.)</p>
<p class="bas indent2"><span class="nm">2.</span>A minor does so, lest she become pregnant and die.</p>
<p class="bas indent1"><span class="nm">(g)</span><span class="cl">Answer:</span> R. Yochanan expounds "Zos Toras ha'Yoledes" to include whether she is sane or insane.</p>
<p class="bas indent2"><span class="nm">1.</span>A man brings Korbanos for his wife if she is insane, like R. Yehudah taught:</p>
<p class="bas indent3"><span class="nm">i.</span><span class="cl">(Beraisa - R. Yehudah):</span> A (rich) man brings the Korban of a rich person on behalf of his wife. He brings all Korbanos she is obligated to bring;</p>
<p class="bas indent3"><span class="nm">ii.</span>In the Kesuvah, he obligated himself to do so - 'All obligations that you have from before are upon me.'</p>
