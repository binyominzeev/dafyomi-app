<p class="bas indent1"><span class="nm">(a)</span><span class="cl">(Continuation of Beraisa #2 - R. Eliezer):</span> It says "Im Tashuv Yisrael..." (this implies that they must do Teshuvah on their own)!</p>
<p class="bas indent2"><span class="nm">1.</span><span class="cl">R. Yehoshua:</span> It says "ha'Ish Levush ha'Badim... l'Mo'ed Mo'adim... Tichlenah Chol Eleh" (there is a fixed time for the redemption)!</p>
<p class="bas indent2"><span class="nm">2.</span>R. Eliezer was silent.</p>
<p class="bas subject"><span class="nm">2)</span>WHEN MASHI'ACH WILL COME</p>
<p class="bas indent1"><span class="nm">(a)</span><span class="cl">(R. Aba):</span> The Ketz is very explicit - "Harei Yisrael Anpechem Titenu u'Feryechem Tis'u l'Ami Yisrael" (Eretz Yisrael will yield fruit right before Am Yisrael will return).</p>
<p class="bas indent1"><span class="nm">(b)</span><span class="cl">R. Elazar:</span> Will you say that that is more explicit than "Lifnei ha'Yamim ha'Hem Sechar ha'Adam Lo Nihyeh u'Schar ha'Behemah Einenah (when no one has money) vela'Yotzei ula'Ba Ein Shalom Min ha'Tzar"? Then, Mashi'ach will come!</p>
<p class="bas indent1"><span class="nm">(c)</span><span class="cl">Question:</span> What does it mean "vela'Yotzei ula'Ba Ein Shalom Min ha'Tzar"?</p>
<p class="bas indent1"><span class="nm">(d)</span><span class="cl">Answer #1 (Rav):</span> Chachamim, who should have Shalom, will not, due to the afflictions (alternatively - due to the Yetzer ha'Ra).</p>
<p class="bas indent1"><span class="nm">(e)</span><span class="cl">Answer #2 (Shmuel):</span> Prices of all foods will be equal (Ben Yehoyada - and merchants cannot profit; Aruch - all measures will be the same, for no one is corrupt; Maharsha - all the gates will be equal (there will not be special gates for entry and others for exit), because there is no Shalom from the oppressor).</p>
<p class="bas indent1"><span class="nm">(f)</span><span class="cl">(R. Chanina):</span> Ben David will not come until they will seek fish for a sick person and not find it - "Ashki'a Meimeihem v'Naharoseihem ka'Shemen Olich (the rivers will be as thick as oil, fish cannot live in them) ba'Yom ha'Hu Atzmi'ach Keren l'Veis Yisrael."</p>
<p class="bas indent1"><span class="nm">(g)</span><span class="cl">(R. Chama bar Chanina):</span> Ben David will not come until Yisrael will not have even the lightest authority (Rashi; Maharsha - until the disgraced kingdom (Edom) will be eradicated) - "v'Charas ha'Zalzalim... ba'Es ha'Hi Yuval Shai la'Shem Tzevakos Am Memushach u'Morat."</p>
<p class="bas indent1"><span class="nm">(h)</span><span class="cl">(Ze'iri):</span> Ben David will not come until haughty people cease from Yisrael - "Az Asir mi'Kirbech Alizei Ga'avasech... v'Hish'arti b'Kirbech Am Oni va'Dal v'Chasu b'Shem Hash-m."</p>
<p class="bas indent1"><span class="nm">(i)</span><span class="cl">(R. Simlai):</span> Ben David will not come until all judges and officers cease from Yisrael - "v'Ashivah Yadi Alayich... v'Ashivah Shoftayich."</p>
<p class="bas indent1"><span class="nm">(j)</span><span class="cl">(Ula):</span> Yerushalayim (Rambam - Yisrael) will only be redeemed through Tzedakah - "Tziyon b'Mishpat Tipadeh v'Shaveha bi'Tzdakah."</p>
<p class="bas indent1"><span class="nm">(k)</span><span class="cl">(Rav Papa):</span> If haughty people cease, the Amgushi (Parsi witches that afflict Yisrael; alternatively - enticers, avid idolaters that constantly blaspheme) will cease - "v'Etzrof ka'Bor Sigayich v'Asirah Kol Bedilayich";</p>
<p class="bas indent2"><span class="nm">1.</span>If judges cease, your enemy will cease - "Hesir Hash-m Mishpatayich Pinah Oyvayech."</p>
<p class="bas indent1"><span class="nm">(l)</span><span class="cl">(R. Yochanan):</span> If you see the generation declining, wait for Mashi'ach - "v'Es Am Oni Toshi'a."</p>
<p class="bas indent1"><span class="nm">(m)</span><span class="cl">(R. Yochanan):</span> If you see many afflictions besetting the generation like a river, wait for Mashi'ach - "Ki Yavo cha'Nahar Tzar... u'Vo l'Tziyon Go'el."</p>
<p class="bas indent1"><span class="nm">(n)</span><span class="cl">(R. Yochanan):</span> Ben David will only come in a generation that is totally worthy or totally guilty:</p>
<p class="bas indent2"><span class="nm">1.</span>He can come in a totally worthy generation - "v'Amcha Kulam Tzadikim l'Olam Yirshu Aretz";</p>
<p class="bas indent2"><span class="nm">2.</span>He can come in a totally unworthy generation - "va'Yar Ki Ein Ish... Lema'ani E'eseh."</p>
<p class="bas indent1"><span class="nm">(o)</span><span class="cl">Contradiction (R. Alexandri):</span> "B'Itah" connotes that Mashi'ach will come in the proper time. "Achishenu" connotes that Hash-m will bring him early!</p>
<p class="bas indent1"><span class="nm">(p)</span><span class="cl">Resolution:</span> If we merit, He will bring him early. If not, he will come in the proper time.</p>
<p class="bas indent1"><span class="nm">(q)</span><span class="cl">Contradiction (R. Alexandri):</span> It says "va'Aru Im Ananei Shmaya..." (Mashi'ach will come quickly", and it says "Oni v'Rochev Al Chamor" (lazily)!</p>
<p class="bas indent1"><span class="nm">(r)</span><span class="cl">Resolution:</span> If we merit, he will come quickly. If not, he will come slowly.</p>
<p class="bas subject"><span class="nm">3)</span>WHEN MASHI'ACH WILL COME (cont.)</p>
<p class="bas indent1"><span class="nm">(a)</span><span class="cl">Shevor Malka:</span> You say that Mashi'ach will come on a donkey. I will send him my most beautiful (or fastest) horse!</p>
<p class="bas indent1"><span class="nm">(b)</span><span class="cl">Shmuel:</span> Do you have a horse of 100 colors? (We may not derive that Mashi'ach's horse will have 100 colors. This was a mere retort to a disrespectful comment.)</p>
<p class="bas indent1"><span class="nm">(c)</span>R. Yehoshua ben Levi found Eliyahu by the cave in which R. Shimon hid for 13 years. He asked 'will I come to the world to come?'</p>
<p class="bas indent2"><span class="nm">1.</span><span class="cl">Eliyahu:</span> If Hash-m wants, you will.</p>
<p class="bas indent2"><span class="nm">2.</span><span class="cl">R. Yehoshua ben Levi:</span> I see only the two of us, but I heard a third voice! (The Shechinah was there.) When will Mashi'ach come?</p>
<p class="bas indent2"><span class="nm">3.</span><span class="cl">Eliyahu:</span> Ask Mashi'ach himself!</p>
<p class="bas indent2"><span class="nm">4.</span><span class="cl">R. Yehoshua ben Levi:</span> Where is he?</p>
<p class="bas indent2"><span class="nm">5.</span><span class="cl">Eliyahu:</span> He is at the gate of (Rashi - Gan Eden that faces) the city.</p>
<p class="bas indent2"><span class="nm">6.</span><span class="cl">R. Yehoshua ben Levi:</span> How will I recognize him?</p>
<p class="bas indent2"><span class="nm">7.</span><span class="cl">Eliyahu:</span> He is sitting among poor Metzora'im. They undo all their bandages at the same time (to clean the wounds) and retie them. He opens only one at a time, to minimize the delay (to retie them) in case he will suddenly be called to redeem Yisrael.</p>
<p class="bas indent2"><span class="nm">8.</span><span class="cl">R. Yehoshua ben Levi (to Mashi'ach):</span> Shalom to you, my Rebbi and teacher!</p>
<p class="bas indent2"><span class="nm">9.</span><span class="cl">Mashi'ach:</span> Shalom to you, son of Levi!</p>
<p class="bas indent2"><span class="nm">10.</span><span class="cl">R. Yehoshua ben Levi:</span> When will Rebbi come?</p>
<p class="bas indent2"><span class="nm">11.</span><span class="cl">Mashi'ach:</span> Today!</p>
<p class="bas indent1"><span class="nm">(d)</span>R. Yehoshua ben Levi told Eliyahu that Mashi'ach answered 'Shalom to you, son of Levi.' Eliyahu said that this shows that he and his father will both be in the world to come.</p>
<p class="bas indent2"><span class="nm">1.</span><span class="cl">R. Yehoshua ben Levi:</span> He lied to me! He said 'I am coming today', but he did not!</p>
<p class="bas indent2"><span class="nm">2.</span><span class="cl">Eliyahu:</span> He meant "ha'Yom Im b'Kolo Sishma'u (today, if you will heed His voice)."</p>
<p class="bas indent1"><span class="nm">(e)</span><span class="cl">R. Yosi ben Kisma's Talmidim:</span> When will Mashi'ach come?</p>
<p class="bas indent1"><span class="nm">(f)</span><span class="cl">R. Yosi ben Kisma:</span> I fear that you will request a sign (a miracle to prove the truth of my words)!</p>
<p class="bas indent1"><span class="nm">(g)</span><span class="cl">Talmidim:</span> We will not!</p>
<p class="bas indent1"><span class="nm">(h)</span><span class="cl">R. Yosi:</span> The gate (of Romi) will fall three times, and they will rebuild it twice. Before they will rebuild it the third time, he will come.</p>
<p class="bas indent1"><span class="nm">(i)</span><span class="cl">Talmidim:</span> Give us a sign!</p>
<p class="bas indent1"><span class="nm">(j)</span><span class="cl">R. Yosi:</span> You said that you will not request one!</p>
<p class="bas indent1"><span class="nm">(k)</span><span class="cl">Talmidim:</span> Nevertheless, please give one!</p>
<p class="bas indent1"><span class="nm">(l)</span><span class="cl">R. Yosi:</span> The water of the Pamyus (the source of the Yarden river) should turn to blood. (It did.)</p>
<p class="bas indent1"><span class="nm">(m)</span>Just before R. Yosi ben Kisma died, he requested that they bury his coffin very deep, for the Parsi'im (in the war of Gog and Magog) will have a horse tied to every tree in Bavel (which they will conquer before invading Eretz Yisrael), and they will dig up all the coffins in Eretz Yisrael to use for feeding troughs for their horses.</p>

<p class="bas subject"><span class="nm">4)</span>THE PERIOD BEFORE MASHI'ACH</p>
<p class="bas indent1"><span class="nm">(a)</span><span class="cl">(Rav):</span> "Yitnem Ad Es Yoledah" - Ben David will not come until the kingdom (Romi) spreads over Yisrael (who are scattered over the entire world) for nine months.</p>
<p class="bas indent1"><span class="nm">(b)</span><span class="cl">Ula and Rabah:</span> Mashi'ach should come, but I should not be there (to experience the suffering)!</p>
<p class="bas indent1"><span class="nm">(c)</span><span class="cl">Rav Yosef:</span> Mashi'ach should come, and may I merit to sit in the shade of the dung of his donkey!</p>
<p class="bas indent1"><span class="nm">(d)</span><span class="cl">Abaye (to Rabah):</span> Why don't you want to witness Mashi'ach? Is it due to the suffering? You have Torah and Chesed, so you will be spared!</p>
<p class="bas indent2"><span class="nm">1.</span><span class="cl">(Beraisa):</span> One who wants to be spared the suffering that will accompany Mashi'ach should engage in Torah and Chesed.</p>
<p class="bas indent1"><span class="nm">(e)</span><span class="cl">Rabah:</span> Perhaps I will not be spared due to sin.</p>
<p class="bas indent2"><span class="nm">1.</span><span class="cl">Contradiction (R. Yakov):</span> Hash-m promised Yakov "u'Shmarticha b'Chol Asher Telech", yet "Va'Yira Yakov Me'od"!</p>
<p class="bas indent2"><span class="nm">2.</span><span class="cl">Answer:</span> He was afraid that he had forfeited the promise due to sin.</p>
<p class="bas indent1"><span class="nm">(f)</span>"Ad Ya'avor Hash-m" refers to Yisrael's first entry into Eretz Yisrael (with Yehoshua). "Ad Ya'avor Am Zu Kanisa" refers to the second entry (with Ezra);</p>
<p class="bas indent2"><span class="nm">1.</span>This teaches that Yisrael were worthy to enter the second time amidst miracles like the first time. They did not, because they sinned.</p>
<p class="bas indent1"><span class="nm">(g)</span><span class="cl">R. Yochanan:</span> Mashi'ach should come, and I should not be there.</p>
<p class="bas indent1"><span class="nm">(h)</span><span class="cl">Suggestion (Reish Lakish):</span> Are you afraid of "Ka'asher Yanus Ish Mipnei ha'Ari u'Fga'o ha'Dov... u'Nshacho Nachash"?</p>
<p class="bas indent2"><span class="nm">1.</span>You should not fear this. Even now, we have afflictions like this! One who encounters a Santer (an official authorized to mark off the borders) in the field is afraid like one who sees a lion (lest he shorten his field). In the city he encounters the tax collector. This is like encountering a bear. He returns home and sees his children hungry. This is like being bitten by a snake!</p>
<p class="bas indent1"><span class="nm">(i)</span><span class="cl">Rejection:</span> Rather, he fears "...Ra'isi Chol Gever... ka'Yoledah v'Nehefchu Chol Panim l'Yerakon."</p>
<p class="bas indent2"><span class="nm">1.</span><span class="cl">Question:</span> What does it mean "Ra'isi Chol Gever..."?</p>
<p class="bas indent2"><span class="nm">2.</span><span class="cl">Version #1 - Rashi - Answer (Rava bar Yitzchak):</span> (Hash-m), who has all Gevurah (strength, will feel pain over the destruction of the Nochrim like a woman in labor).</p>
<p class="bas indent2"><span class="nm">3.</span><span class="cl">Version #2 - Ramah - Answer (Rava bar Yitzchak):</span> The strongest man will be afraid like a woman in labor.</p>
<p class="bas indent2"><span class="nm">4.</span><span class="cl">Question:</span> What does it mean "Chol Panim l'Yerakon"?</p>
<p class="bas indent2"><span class="nm">5.</span><span class="cl">Answer (R. Yochanan):</span> Both angels and Yisrael will turn green when Hash-m says 'both Yisrael and the Nochrim are My creations. How can I destroy one for the sake of the other?!'</p>
<p class="bas indent3"><span class="nm">i.</span><span class="cl">Version #1 - Rashi - (Rav Papa):</span> This is like people say, when the ox fell, its owner uses a horse in its stead and lets the horse eat from the ox' trough. (When the ox recovers, he feels bad about kicking out the horse. Likewise, Hash-m gave power to Nochrim when Yisrael sinned. When Yisrael repent, He feels bad about having to demote them.)</p>
<p class="bas indent3"><span class="nm">ii.</span><span class="cl">Version #2 - Ramah - (Rav Papa):</span> This is like people say, an ox falls when it runs and tries to gore a horse, but in the end it will gore it in its trough. (Likewise, Hash-m has not yet destroyed the Nochrim (seemingly, He does not want to), but in the end He will for the sake of Yisrael.)</p>
<p class="bas indent1"><span class="nm">(j)</span><span class="cl">(Rav Gidal):</span> In the future, Yisrael will enjoy the satiation of Yemos ha'Mashi'ach.</p>
<p class="bas indent1"><span class="nm">(k)</span><span class="cl">Objection (Rav Yosef):</span> This is obvious. Who else would enjoy it?!</p>
<p class="bas indent1"><span class="nm">(l)</span><span class="cl">Answer:</span> Rav Gidal comes to argue with R. Hillel, who says that the prophecies of Yemos ha'Mashi'ach were already fulfilled in the days of Chizkiyah.</p>
<p class="bas indent1"><span class="nm">(m)</span><span class="cl">(Rav):</span> The world was created for the sake of David (Rashi - who sang so many praises to Hash-m; Ran - the epitome of this physical world was in his days).</p>
<p class="bas indent1"><span class="nm">(n)</span><span class="cl">(Shmuel):</span> It was created for the sake of Moshe (who received the Torah).</p>
<p class="bas indent1"><span class="nm">(o)</span><span class="cl">(R. Yochanan):</span> It was created for the sake of Mashi'ach.</p>
<p class="bas subject"><span class="nm">5)</span>WHO WILL BE MASHI'ACH?</p>
<p class="bas indent1"><span class="nm">(a)</span><span class="cl">Question:</span> What is the name of Mashi'ach?</p>
<p class="bas indent1"><span class="nm">(b)</span><span class="cl">Answer #1 (d'Vei R. Shila):</span> His name is Shilo - "Ad Ki Yavo Shilo."</p>
<p class="bas indent1"><span class="nm">(c)</span><span class="cl">Answer #2 (d'Vei R. Yanai):</span> It is Yinun - "Yinun Shemo."</p>
<p class="bas indent1"><span class="nm">(d)</span><span class="cl">Answer #3 (d'Vei R. Chaninah):</span> It is Chaninah - "Lo Eten Lachem Chaninah."</p>
<p class="bas indent1"><span class="nm">(e)</span><span class="cl">Answer #4:</span> Some say, it is Menachem ben Chizkiyah - "Rochak Mimeni Menachem Meshiv Nafshi." (Maharsha - Mashi'ach was born in the days of Yirmeyah, but Hash-m withdrew him to Gan Eden until the proper time. Tradition teaches that his father was Chizkiyah.)</p>
<p class="bas indent1"><span class="nm">(f)</span><span class="cl">Answer #5 (Rabanan):</span> It is Chivara d'Vei Rebbi - "Chalayenu Hu Nasa... Chashavnuhu Nagu'a Mukeh Elokim." (People thought that he was a Metzora, whose skin turns very Chiver (white). He will be from the house of Rebbi.)</p>
<p class="bas indent1"><span class="nm">(g)</span><span class="cl">(Rav Nachman):</span> If Mashi'ach is alive today, it is someone like me - "v'Hayah Adiro Mimenu u'Moshlo mi'Kirbo Yetzei." (Rav Nachman married the daughter of the Reish Galusa, so he was very powerful.)</p>
<p class="bas indent1"><span class="nm">(h)</span><span class="cl">(Rav):</span> If Mashi'ach is alive today, it is (someone like - one explanation in Rashi deletes this) Rebbi. If he is dead, it is (someone like) Daniel. (Both were great Tzadikim who were greatly afflicted).</p>
<p class="bas indent1"><span class="nm">(i)</span><span class="cl">(Rav Yehudah):</span> Hash-m will establish another (king like) David - "v'Ovdu Es Hash-m Elokeihem v'Es David Malkam Asher Akim Lahem";</p>
<p class="bas indent2"><span class="nm">1.</span>It does not say 'Hekim' (established), rather, "Akim" (I will establish).</p>
<p class="bas indent1"><span class="nm">(j)</span><span class="cl">Question (Rav Papa):</span> It says "v'David Avdi Nasi Lahem l'Olam"!</p>
<p class="bas indent1"><span class="nm">(k)</span><span class="cl">Answer (Abaye):</span> It says that David will be <i>Nasi</i> (not Melech). He will be second to the new king.</p>
<p class="bas indent1"><span class="nm">(l)</span><span class="cl">(R. Simlai):</span> "Hoy ha'Mis'avim Es Yom Hash-m... Choshech v'Lo Or" - woe to Nochrim who await Mashi'ach!</p>
<p class="bas indent2"><span class="nm">1.</span>A parable explains this. A rooster and a bat were awaiting dawn. The rooster said, I await the light, for I can see. (You cannot see. Why do you wait for the light?!</p>
