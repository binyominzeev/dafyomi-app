<div class="subject"><span class="nm">1)</span><p>THE DISGRACE OF THE THIRD GROUP</p></div>
<div class="indent1"><span class="nm">(a)</span><p><span class="cl">(Mishnah):</span> The first group left...</p></div>
<div class="indent1"><span class="nm">(b)</span><p><span class="cl">(Beraisa):</span> The third group is called 'the lazy group'.</p></div>
<div class="indent1"><span class="nm">(c)</span><p><span class="cl">Question:</span> We need three groups!</p></div>
<div class="indent1"><span class="nm">(d)</span><p><span class="cl">Answer:</span> Nevertheless, they should have been zealous to be among the first groups!</p></div>
<div class="indent2"><span class="nm">1.</span><p><span class="cl">(Beraisa):</span> The world needs perfumers and tanners - fortunate is a perfumer, but woe to the tanner (he works with excrement and absorbs a bad smell).</p></div>
<div class="indent2"><span class="nm">2.</span><p>The world needs males and females - fortunate is one who has sons, woe to the one with daughters (Sanhedrin 100B - a girl's father has many worries, lest she will be seduced, be Mezanah, not get married, be barren, or do witchcraft).</p></div>
<div class="subject"><span class="nm">2)</span><p>THE BLOOD ON THE FLOOR</p></div>
<div class="indent1"><span class="nm">(a)</span><p><span class="cl">(Mishnah):</span> It is offered on Shabbos...[Kohanim washed the floor - Chachamim disapproved].</p></div>
<div class="indent1"><span class="nm">(b)</span><p><span class="cl">Question:</span> Which Chachamim disapproved?</p></div>
<div class="indent1"><span class="nm">(c)</span><p><span class="cl">Answer #1 (Rav Chisda):</span> R. Eliezer would object, but Chachamim say that it is only Shevus, which does not apply in the Mikdash.</p></div>
<div class="indent2"><span class="nm">1.</span><p><span class="cl">Question:</span> What is the source that they argue about this?</p></div>
<div class="indent2"><span class="nm">2.</span><p><span class="cl">Answer (Beraisa - R. Eliezer):</span> If one milked, curdled milk or made cheese the Shi'ur of k'Grogeres, swept (this is like rinsing a floor) or Ribetz (sprinkled water to prevent dust from rising) or removed cakes of honey from a hive:</p></div>
<div class="indent3"><span class="nm">i.</span><p>If he did so on Shabbos b'Shogeg, he is Chayav Chatas; if he did so on Yom Tov b'Mezid, he gets 40 lashes.</p></div>
<div class="indent2"><span class="nm">3.</span><p>Chachamim say, these [last three - they agree about the first three] are only Shevus on Shabbos or Yom Tov.</p></div>
<div class="indent1"><span class="nm">(d)</span><p><span class="cl">Answer #2 (Rav Ashi):</span> Even Chachamim [of R. Eliezer] disapproved - the Mishnah is like R. Noson:</p></div>
<div class="indent2"><span class="nm">1.</span><p><span class="cl">(Beraisa - R. Noson):</span> Chachamim permitted [in the Mikdash] only Shevus necessary for the Avodah.</p></div>
<div class="indent1"><span class="nm">(e)</span><p><span class="cl">(Mishnah - R. Yehudah):</span> They would gather a cup of blood...</p></div>
<div class="indent1"><span class="nm">(f)</span><p><span class="cl">(Beraisa - R. Yehudah):</span> They would gather a cup from the blood on the floor from all the Korbanos and throw it on the Mizbe'ach, to Machshir a Korban in case its blood spilled;</p></div>
<div class="indent2"><span class="nm">1.</span><p><span class="cl">Chachamim:</span> The blood [fell straight from the neck, it] was never received in a Keli [it is Pasul]!</p></div>
<div class="indent2"><span class="nm">2.</span><p><span class="cl">Question:</span> How do Chachamim know this?!</p></div>
<div class="indent2"><span class="nm">3.</span><p><span class="cl">Correction - Chachamim:</span> <i>Perhaps</i> the blood was never received in a Keli!</p></div>
<div class="indent2"><span class="nm">4.</span><p><span class="cl">R. Yehudah:</span> We do this because [at least some of] the blood was received in a Keli [and later spilled].</p></div>
<div class="indent2"><span class="nm">5.</span><p><span class="cl">Question:</span> How does R. Yehudah know this?!</p></div>
<div class="indent2"><span class="nm">6.</span><p><span class="cl">Answer:</span> Kohanim are zealous [to receive the blood in time].</p></div>
<div class="indent2"><span class="nm">7.</span><p><span class="cl">Question:</span> If so, why did it spill?</p></div>
<div class="indent2"><span class="nm">8.</span><p><span class="cl">Answer:</span> Because they are zealous [they work quickly, therefore] it spilled.</p></div>
<div class="indent1"><span class="nm">(g)</span><p><span class="cl">Question:</span> It is mixed with Dam Tamtzis (blood that drips out, it is Pasul for Zerikah - surely Dam Tamtzis is the majority, for we let all of it drip on the floor)!</p></div>
<div class="indent1"><span class="nm">(h)</span><p><span class="cl">Answer #1:</span> This is like R. Yehudah holds elsewhere, that Dam Tamtzis is proper blood:</p></div>
<div class="indent2"><span class="nm">1.</span><p><span class="cl">(Beraisa):</span> A Lav forbids [eating] Dam Tamtzis;</p></div>
<div class="indent2"><span class="nm">2.</span><p>R. Yehudah says, it is forbidden by Kares.</p></div>
<div class="indent1"><span class="nm">(i)</span><p><span class="cl">Objection:</span>  But R. Elazar taught that R. Yehudah admits that Dam Tamtzis is not Mechaper!</p></div>
<div class="indent2"><span class="nm">1.</span><p>"B'Nefesh Yechaper" - only Dam ha'Nefesh is Mechaper.</p></div>
<div class="bbbline">65b----------------------------------------65b</p></div>
<div class="indent1"><span class="nm">(j)</span><p><span class="cl">Answer #2:</span> This is as R. Yehudah holds elsewhere, that blood does not Mevatel blood [because it is Min b'Mino].</p></div>
<div class="indent1"><span class="nm">(k)</span><p><span class="cl">(Beraisa - R. Yehudah):</span> According to you, why do they plug up the Azarah [to keep the blood inside]?</p></div>
<div class="indent1"><span class="nm">(l)</span><p><span class="cl">Chachamim:</span> It is praiseworthy for Kohanim to serve when they are up to their knees in blood!</p></div>
<div class="indent1"><span class="nm">(m)</span><p><span class="cl">Question:</span> The blood is a Chatzitzah between the Kohen and the floor!</p></div>
<div class="indent1"><span class="nm">(n)</span><p><span class="cl">Answer:</span> It is wet, so it is not a Chatzitzah.</p></div>
<div class="indent2"><span class="nm">1.</span><p><span class="cl">(Mishnah):</span> The following are a Chatzitzah if they are dry, not if they are wet - blood, ink, milk and honey.</p></div>
<div class="indent1"><span class="nm">(o)</span><p><span class="cl">Question:</span> The Bigdei Kehunah will get dirty!</p></div>
<div class="indent2"><span class="nm">1.</span><p><span class="cl">(Mishnah):</span> If a Kohen served with dirty clothes, the Avodah is Pasul.</p></div>
<div class="indent2"><span class="nm">2.</span><p><span class="cl">Suggestion:</span> The Kohanim lift their garments.</p></div>
<div class="indent2"><span class="nm">3.</span><p><span class="cl">Rejection:</span> "Mido" - his garments must be like his Midah (size; Rashi - theys ` reach to the ground), they cannot be too long or short.</p></div>
<div class="indent1"><span class="nm">(p)</span><p><span class="cl">Answer #1:</span> Their clothes may be dirty when they take the limbs to the ramp, for this is not Avodah.</p></div>
<div class="indent1"><span class="nm">(q)</span><p><span class="cl">Rejection:</span> Since a Kohen must do it, it is Avodah!</p></div>
<div class="indent2"><span class="nm">1.</span><p><span class="cl">(Beraisa):</span> "V'Hikriv ha'Kohen Es ha'Kol" - this is taking limbs to the ramp.</p></div>
<div class="indent1"><span class="nm">(r)</span><p><span class="cl">Answer #2:</span> Rather, their clothes may be dirty when they bring wood to the Ma'arachah (the pile on the Mizbe'ach), this is not Avodah.</p></div>
<div class="indent1"><span class="nm">(s)</span><p><span class="cl">Question:</span> The Kohanim bringing limbs to the ramp and blood to the Mizbe'ach must keep their garments clean - how can they do this?</p></div>
<div class="indent1"><span class="nm">(t)</span><p><span class="cl">Answer:</span> They stand on platforms (they are built into the floor, so they are not a Chatzitzah).</p></div>
<div class="subject"><span class="nm">3)</span><p>THE END OF THE HAKRAVAH</p></div>
<div class="indent1"><span class="nm">(a)</span><p><span class="cl">(Mishnah) Question:</span> How do we suspend and flay? ...They tore the animal and removed the Eimurim; he put them in a bowl and burned them on the Mizbe'ach (R. Akiva Eiger's text).</p></div>
<div class="indent1"><span class="nm">(b)</span><p><span class="cl">Question:</span> [The Zar himself flays -] he may not burn them on the Mizbe'ach!</p></div>
<div class="indent1"><span class="nm">(c)</span><p><span class="cl">Answer:</span> It should say 'to be burned on the Mizbe'ach'.</p></div>
<div class="indent1"><span class="nm">(d)</span><p><span class="cl">(Mishnah):</span> [On Shabbos] the first group left...</p></div>
<div class="indent1"><span class="nm">(e)</span><p><span class="cl">(Beraisa):</span> Everyone puts his Pesach in its skin and carries it over his back.</p></div>
<div class="indent1"><span class="nm">(f)</span><p><span class="cl">(Rav Ilish):</span> This is like Aravi merchants! (Ya'avetz - he teaches that one should lower himself to endear and honor Mitzvos.)</p></div>
<div class="perekline">PEREK ELU DEVARIM</div>
<div class="subject"><span class="nm">4)</span><p>WHICH NEEDS OF PESACH OVERRIDE SHABBOS?</p></div>
<div class="indent1"><span class="nm">(a)</span><p><span class="cl">(Mishnah):</span> The following needs of offering Pesach [on Shabbos] Docheh (override) Shabbos - slaughter, Zerikah, Michuy (this will be explained) of the innards and Haktarah of the Chelev;</p></div>
<div class="indent1"><span class="nm">(b)</span><p>Roasting it and rinsing the innards are not Docheh Shabbos.</p></div>
<div class="indent1"><span class="nm">(c)</span><p>Carrying it (even though Reshus ha'Rabim, carrying a being that can walk is only Shevus), bringing it from outside the Techum and cutting a wart off it are not Docheh;</p></div>
<div class="indent1"><span class="nm">(d)</span><p>R. Eliezer says, a Kal va'Chomer teaches that they are Docheh Shabbos!</p></div>
<div class="indent2"><span class="nm">1.</span><p>Slaughtering is an Av Melachah, yet it is Docheh Shabbos - these are only Shevus, all the more so they are Docheh Shabbos!</p></div>
<div class="indent1"><span class="nm">(e)</span><p><span class="cl">R. Yehoshua:</span> Yom Tov disproves this - Melachah [of food preparation] is permitted, nevertheless Shevus is forbidden!</p></div>
<div class="indent1"><span class="nm">(f)</span><p><span class="cl">R. Eliezer:</span> You cannot bring a proof from Reshus (something optional) to a Mitzvah (perhaps we are more lenient for a Mitzvah)!</p></div>
<div class="indent1"><span class="nm">(g)</span><p><span class="cl">R. Akiva:</span> Haza'ah (sprinkling with Mei Chatas to Metaher from Tum'as Mes) is only Shevus, nevertheless it is forbidden even for a Mitzvah [e.g. if the only way he can become Tahor in time to offer Pesach is if he will be sprinkled on Shabbos] - therefore it is reasonable that other Shevusim are forbidden for a Mitzvah!</p></div>
<div class="indent1"><span class="nm">(h)</span><p><span class="cl">R. Eliezer:</span> My Kal va'Chomer also permits this! Slaughtering is an Av Melachah, yet it is Docheh Shabbos - Haza'ah is only Shevus, all the more it is Docheh!</p></div>
