<p class="bas subject"><span class="nm">1)</span>ARE OLD TREES CONSIDERED PRINCIPAL?</p>
<p class="bas indent1"><span class="nm">(a)</span><span class="cl">Question (Mishnah):</span> If a married woman inherited old vines or date trees, we sell the wood to buy land and her husband eats the Peros.</p>
<p class="bas indent1"><span class="nm">(b)</span><span class="cl">Answer #1:</span> The Mishnah says that 'they grew old'.</p>
<p class="bas indent1"><span class="nm">(c)</span><span class="cl">Answer #2:</span> We established the Mishnah (in Kesuvos) to be when she inherited trees in another's field. (Since she has nothing after they are cut, Abaye agrees that they are considered principal.)</p>
<p class="bas subject"><span class="nm">2)</span>AMBIGUOUS DOCUMENTS</p>
<p class="bas indent1"><span class="nm">(a)</span>A document (of Mashkanta) said 'years' without specifying how many. Reuven (the lender) says that it was for three years, and Shimon (the borrower) says that it was for two.</p>
<p class="bas indent1"><span class="nm">(b)</span><span class="cl">(Rav Yehudah):</span> If Reuven already ate the Peros for three years, he must pay for the last year. When in doubt, we establish land to belong to the original owner (Shimon);</p>
<p class="bas indent1"><span class="nm">(c)</span><span class="cl">(Rav Kahana):</span> Our question is about the Peros, which are with Reuven. The Chazakah favors him, he need not pay.</p>
<p class="bas indent1"><span class="nm">(d)</span>The Halachah follows Rav Kahana.</p>
<p class="bas indent1"><span class="nm">(e)</span><span class="cl">Question:</span> The Halachah follows Rav Nachman (in monetary laws), who says that when in doubt, we apply Chazakah to the land and say that it belongs to the original owner!</p>
<p class="bas indent1"><span class="nm">(f)</span><span class="cl">Answer:</span> That is when the doubt will never be resolved (e.g. two expressions contradict each other, and we do not know which to follow);</p>
<p class="bas indent2"><span class="nm">1.</span>Here, witnesses might come and testify how many years it was for. Beis Din does not force someone to pay if we anticipate that future testimony might force Beis Din to retract its ruling.</p>
<p class="bas indent1"><span class="nm">(g)</span><span class="cl">(Rav Yehudah):</span> If Reuven says that it was for five years (and he lost the document), and Shimon says it was for three, Reuven is believed, Migo (since) he could have said that he bought it (i.e. if he wanted to lie, he had a better lie to say).</p>
<p class="bas indent1"><span class="nm">(h)</span><span class="cl">Rav Papa:</span> Rav Zvid and Rav Avira argue with Rav Yehudah.</p>
<p class="bas indent2"><span class="nm">1.</span>A buyer is careful with his document only for three years, but a lender is careful as long as he is entitled to eat the Peros. (We assume that he did not lose it, rather, he is hiding it in order to eat extra Peros.)</p>
<p class="bas indent1"><span class="nm">(i)</span><span class="cl">Question ((Rashi - against Rav Yehudah; Rashba - also against Rav Zvid and Rav Avira) - Ravina):</span> If so, Mashkanta of Sura, in which they write 'after such and such years, the land reverts to the owner for free', the lender should be believed to say that he bought it!</p>
<p class="bas indent2"><span class="nm">1.</span>Chachamim would not enact something that enables the lender to steal!</p>
<p class="bas indent1"><span class="nm">(j)</span><span class="cl">Answer (Rav Ashi):</span> Chachamim enacted that the borrower pays the taxes and fix the trench around the field (so all will know that he did not sell it).</p>
<p class="bas indent1"><span class="nm">(k)</span><span class="cl">Question:</span> If the land has no taxes or trenches, what will be?</p>
<p class="bas indent1"><span class="nm">(l)</span><span class="cl">Answer:</span> He must protest (tell people) that the land was not sold, it is being eaten for Mashkanta. (This obligates one who claims that he bought the land to guard the document.)</p>
<p class="bas indent1"><span class="nm">(m)</span><span class="cl">Question:</span> If he did not protest, what will be?</p>
<p class="bas indent1"><span class="nm">(n)</span><span class="cl">Answer:</span> He caused his own loss through his negligence.</p>
<p class="bas indent1"><span class="nm">(o)</span><span class="cl">(Rav Yehudah):</span> If Reuven (a sharecropper) claims that Shimon hired him on condition to receive half the Peros, and Shimon says that he promised to give a third, Shimon is believed;</p>
<p class="bas indent1"><span class="nm">(p)</span><span class="cl">(Rav Nachman):</span> We follow the local custom.</p>
<p class="bas indent1"><span class="nm">(q)</span><span class="cl">Suggestion:</span> Rav Yehudah can agree with Rav Nachman. Rav Yehudah teaches about a place where the custom is that sharecroppers get a third.</p>
<p class="bas indent1"><span class="nm">(r)</span><span class="cl">Rejection (Rav Mari bra d'bas Shmuel citing Abaye):</span> No. Even in a place where sharecroppers get half, Shimon is believed, Migo he could say that Reuven is not his sharecropper, rather, he is only a hired worker.</p>
<p class="bas subject"><span class="nm">3)</span>COLLECTING FOR IMPROVEMENTS</p>
<p class="bas indent1"><span class="nm">(a)</span><span class="cl">Question:</span> Reuven died, leaving land and a creditor (Shimon). His orphans claim that they improved the land (and Shimon can only collect from the value of what they inherited). Shimon claims that Reuven improved the land. Who must bring proof?</p>
<p class="bas bbbline">110b----------------------------------------110b</p>
<p class="bas indent1"><span class="nm">(b)</span><span class="cl">Answer #1 (R. Chanina):</span> The land is in the Chazakah of the orphans. Shimon must bring proof.</p>
<p class="bas indent1"><span class="nm">(c)</span><span class="cl">Rejection and Answer #2:</span> R. Yochanan said that the orphans must bring proof.</p>
<p class="bas indent1"><span class="nm">(d)</span><span class="cl">Question:</span> What is R. Yochanan's reason?</p>
<p class="bas indent1"><span class="nm">(e)</span><span class="cl">Answer:</span> Since Shimon is destined to collect the land, it is as if he already collected it (he is Muchzak).</p>
<p class="bas indent1"><span class="nm">(f)</span><span class="cl">Support (Abaye - Mishnah):</span> (A tree within 50 Amos of a city may be cut. If it preceded the city, they must compensate the owner.) If we are unsure whether the tree or city came first, it may be cut without paying the owner.</p>
<p class="bas indent2"><span class="nm">1.</span>Since it may be cut in any case, the owner must bring proof to collect;</p>
<p class="bas indent2"><span class="nm">2.</span>Here also, in any case Shimon collects the land. We are unsure whether Shimon must compensate for the improvements, so the orphans must bring proof to collect.</p>
<p class="bas indent1"><span class="nm">(g)</span>The orphans proved that they improved the land.</p>
<p class="bas indent1"><span class="nm">(h)</span><span class="cl">(R. Chanina):</span> Shimon must let them keep a piece of the land worth as much as the Shevach (increased value).</p>
<p class="bas indent1"><span class="nm">(i)</span><span class="cl">Rejection:</span> No, he may give them money.</p>
<p class="bas indent2"><span class="nm">1.</span><span class="cl">(Rav Nachman citing Shmuel):</span> In three cases we evaluate the Shevach (and the one who took the land pays for it) with money: a firstborn (if the brothers improved the land together, the firstborn gets an extra share of the land, but he is not entitled to an extra share of the Shevach), a creditor or widow collecting (a debt or a Kesuvah) from orphans, and a creditor collecting from someone who bought the borrower's land after the loan.</p>
<p class="bas indent1"><span class="nm">(j)</span><span class="cl">Question (Ravina):</span> Does Shmuel really hold that a creditor pays a buyer for Shevach when he takes the land?</p>
<p class="bas indent2"><span class="nm">1.</span><span class="cl">Contradiction (Shmuel):</span> A creditor <i>collects</i> the Shevach. (He need not pay for it.)</p>
<p class="bas indent2"><span class="nm">2.</span><span class="cl">Suggestion:</span> Perhaps Shmuel says that a creditor pays for fruit that is almost ready to be harvested, but he collects fruit that needs to remain attached for a while.</p>
<p class="bas indent2"><span class="nm">3.</span><span class="cl">Rejection:</span> Shmuel often authorized a creditor to collect fruit almost ready to be harvested.</p>
<p class="bas indent1"><span class="nm">(k)</span><span class="cl">Answer:</span> A creditor collects the Shevach for free if he is owed the value of the land and the Shevach;</p>
<p class="bas indent2"><span class="nm">1.</span>If not, he must return the value of the Shevach. Shmuel taught that he may return money.</p>
<p class="bas indent1"><span class="nm">(l)</span><span class="cl">Question:</span> This is according to the opinion that the creditor may take the land even if the buyer has money and wants to pay the debt and keep the land;</p>
<p class="bas indent2"><span class="nm">1.</span>According to the opinion that if the buyer has money he may pay the debt and keep the land (against the creditor's will), the buyer can say, if I had money, you would not get any land. The Shevach should be considered like partial payment, so you must let me keep their value in land!</p>
<p class="bas indent1"><span class="nm">(m)</span><span class="cl">Answer:</span> The case is, the land was made an Aputiki. The loan will be collected only from it.</p>
<p class="bas subject"><span class="nm">4)</span>WHEN WAGES MUST BE PAID</p>
<p class="bas indent1"><span class="nm">(a)</span><span class="cl">(Mishnah):</span> If Reuven rents a field from Shimon for a Shavu'a (seven year period) for 700 Zuz, Shemitah counts like one of the seven years;</p>
<p class="bas indent2"><span class="nm">1.</span>If he rents for seven years for 700 Zuz, Shemitah is not counted among the seven years.</p>
<p class="bas indent1"><span class="nm">(b)</span>The following are the periods for paying workers. A worker hired for a day collects  the entire night (i.e. he must be paid that night). One hired for a night collects the coming day. One hired by the hour collects the entire night or day,</p>
<p class="bas indent2"><span class="nm">1.</span>If one hired for a week, month, year or Shemitah cycle ends working during the day, he collects the entire day. If he ends working at night, he collects the entire night and day.</p>
<p class="bas indent1"><span class="nm">(c)</span><span class="cl">(Gemara - Beraisa):</span> "Lo Salin Pe'ulas Sachir Itecha Ad Boker" teaches that a worker hired for a day must be paid that night;</p>
<p class="bas indent2"><span class="nm">1.</span>"B'Yomo Titen Scharo" teaches that one hired for a night must be paid the coming day.</p>
<p class="bas indent1"><span class="nm">(d)</span><span class="cl">Question:</span> Perhaps the former verse discusses one hired for the night, and the latter verse discusses one hired for the day!</p>
<p class="bas indent1"><span class="nm">(e)</span><span class="cl">Answer:</span> Wages need not be paid before the job is finished. We cannot obligate one to pay a day worker during the day (or to pay a night worker at night).</p>
<p class="bas indent1"><span class="nm">(f)</span><span class="cl">(Beraisa):</span> "Lo Salin" already forbids keeping a worker's wages the entire night . What does "Ad Boker" add?</p>
<p class="bas indent1"><span class="nm">(g)</span><span class="cl">Answer:</span> This teaches that one transgresses only the first morning.</p>
<p class="bas indent1"><span class="nm">(h)</span><span class="cl">Question:</span> If he further delays paying, what is the law?</p>
<p class="bas indent1"><span class="nm">(i)</span><span class="cl">Answer (Rav):</span> He transgresses 'Bal Tishaheh' (delaying payment).</p>
<p class="bas indent2"><span class="nm">1.</span><span class="cl">(Rav Yosef):</span> Rav learns from "do not say 'Lech va'Shuv, I will pay you tomorrow', when you have the money.</p>
