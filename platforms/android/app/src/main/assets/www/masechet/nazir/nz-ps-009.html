<p class="bas subject"><span class="nm">1)</span>A <i>NAZIR</i> FROM FIGS</p>
<p class="bas indent1"><span class="nm">(a)</span><span class="cl">(Mishnah - Beis Shamai):</span> If one said 'I  am a Nazir from dried figs and pressed dates', he is a Nazir;</p>
<p class="bas indent1"><span class="nm">(b)</span>Beis Hillel say, he is not a Nazir;</p>
<p class="bas indent1"><span class="nm">(c)</span>R. Yehudah says, Beis Shamai say that he is not a Nazir. Rather, he is like one who vowed not to eat figs.</p>
<p class="bas indent1"><span class="nm">(d)</span><span class="cl">(Gemara - Question):</span> Why do Beis Shamai say that he is a Nazir? The Torah said that he must abstain from all that comes from the grapevine!</p>
<p class="bas indent1"><span class="nm">(e)</span><span class="cl">Answer #1:</span> Beis Shamai hold like R. Meir, who says that a person does not say vain words;</p>
<p class="bas indent2"><span class="nm">1.</span>Beis Hillel hold like R. Yosi, who says that when a person says two contradictory things, we heed (also) his latter words;</p>
<p class="bas indent2"><span class="nm">2.</span>The very acceptance of Nezirus was accompanied by regret that nullifies it.</p>
<p class="bas indent1"><span class="nm">(f)</span><span class="cl">Objection:</span> Beis Shamai should agree that his acceptance was accompanied by regret that nullifies it!</p>
<p class="bas indent1"><span class="nm">(g)</span><span class="cl">Answer #2:</span> Beis Shamai hold like R. Meir, who says that a person does not say vain words. Once he said 'I am a Nazir', he becomes a Nazir. When he said 'from dried figs and pressed dates', he comes to nullify his Nezirus through regret;</p>
<p class="bas indent2"><span class="nm">1.</span>Beis Shamai hold that one cannot permit a vow of Hekdesh. The same applies to Nezirus.</p>
<p class="bas indent2"><span class="nm">2.</span>Beis Hillel hold like R. Shimon;</p>
<p class="bas indent3"><span class="nm">i.</span><span class="cl">(Mishnah - R. Shimon):</span> (If one vowed to bring a Minchah of barley) he is exempt, since he did not vow the way voluntary offerings are brought (i.e. from wheat).</p>
<p class="bas bbbline">9b----------------------------------------9b</p>
<p class="bas indent1"><span class="nm">(h)</span>Our Mishnah is unlike R. Nasan;</p>
<p class="bas indent2"><span class="nm">1.</span><span class="cl">Version #1 (Beraisa - R. Nasan):</span> Beis Shamai say that he has a vow not to eat figs and dates, and he is a Nazir;</p>
<p class="bas indent2"><span class="nm">2.</span>Beis Hillel say, he has a vow, but he is not a Nazir.</p>
<p class="bas indent3"><span class="nm">i.</span>Beis Shamai hold like R. Meir (that a person does not say vain words) and like R. Yehudah (in our Mishnah, that 'I am a Nazir from figs' is a vow not to eat figs).</p>
<p class="bas indent3"><span class="nm">ii.</span>Beis Hillel hold like R. Yosi (we heed his latter words).</p>
<p class="bas indent2"><span class="nm">3.</span><span class="cl">Version #2 (Beraisa - R. Nasan):</span> Beis Shamai say that he has a vow not to eat figs and dates, but he is not a Nazir;</p>
<p class="bas indent2"><span class="nm">4.</span>Beis Hillel say, he has no vow and is not a Nazir.</p>
<p class="bas indent3"><span class="nm">i.</span>Beis Shamai hold like R. Yehudah, and Beis Hillel hold like R. Yosi.</p>
<p class="bas subject"><span class="nm">2)</span>A VOW UNLIKE THE TORAH SPECIFIED</p>
<p class="bas indent1"><span class="nm">(a)</span><span class="cl">(Mishnah):</span> If one said 'It is Alai to bring a Minchah from barley', he must bring from wheat. If he vowed to bring 'from unsifted flour', he must bring from sifted. If he vowed 'without oil and frankincense', he must bring with them. If he vowed 'half an Isaron (an Isaron is the volume of 43.2 eggs)', he must bring a full Isaron. If he vowed 'an Isaron and a half', he must bring two Esronim;</p>
<p class="bas indent1"><span class="nm">(b)</span>R. Shimon exempts, because he did not vow in the normal way.</p>
<p class="bas indent1"><span class="nm">(c)</span><span class="cl">Question:</span> Who is the (first) Tana of this Mishnah?</p>
<p class="bas indent1"><span class="nm">(d)</span><span class="cl">Answer #1 (Chizkiyah):</span> It is like Beis Shamai.</p>
<p class="bas indent2"><span class="nm">1.</span>Beis Shamai say if one accepts to be a Nazir from dried figs and pressed dates, he is a (regular) Nazir. Here also, when he says that he will bring from barley, he must bring from wheat.</p>
<p class="bas indent1"><span class="nm">(e)</span><span class="cl">Answer #2 (R. Yochanan):</span> The Mishnah can even be like Beis Hillel. The case is, he said 'had I known that one may not bring thusly, I would had vowed to bring properly,'</p>
<p class="bas indent1"><span class="nm">(f)</span><span class="cl">(Chizkiyah):</span> He must bring (wheat) only when he vowed to bring from barley. If he vowed to bring from lentils, he is exempt.</p>
<p class="bas indent1"><span class="nm">(g)</span><span class="cl">Question:</span> Chizkiyah says that the Mishnah is like Beis Shamai. Just like they say that a vow to be a Nazir from figs makes him a (regular) Nazir, they should say that a vow to bring a Minchah from lentils obligates him to bring a regular Minchah!</p>
<p class="bas indent1"><span class="nm">(h)</span><span class="cl">Answer:</span> Chizkiyah retracted, and no longer says that the Mishnah is like Beis Shamai.</p>
<p class="bas indent1"><span class="nm">(i)</span><span class="cl">Question:</span> Why did he retract?</p>
<p class="bas indent1"><span class="nm">(j)</span><span class="cl">Answer (Rava):</span> The Mishnah obligates one who vowed to bring from barley. If the Mishnah were like Beis Shamai, it should have taught that he is obligated even if he vowed to bring from lentils!</p>
<p class="bas indent2"><span class="nm">1.</span>Rather, the Mishnah is like Beis Shamai according to R. Yehudah (Tosfos deletes this from the text. Rosh - Beis Shamai say that since one can vow from figs, 'Kabalas Nezirus from figs' creates a Neder. Likewise, since there are Menachos from barley, a vow to bring a Minchah from barley creates a Neder to bring a Minchah.)</p>
<p class="bas indent1"><span class="nm">(k)</span><span class="cl">(R. Yochanan):</span> Even if he vowed to bring from lentils, he must bring from wheat.</p>
<p class="bas indent1"><span class="nm">(l)</span><span class="cl">Question:</span> R. Yochanan said that the Mishnah discusses one who said 'had I known that one may not bring thusly, I would had vowed to bring properly!' (Surely he knows that Menachos are not brought from lentils!)</p>
<p class="bas indent1"><span class="nm">(m)</span><span class="cl">Answer:</span> R. Yochanan does not really obligate one who vowed to bring from lentils. He merely teaches that Chizkiyah did not need to retract;</p>
<p class="bas indent2"><span class="nm">1.</span>Chizkiyah retracted because the Mishnah did not teach that one who vowed to bring from lentils is obligated. One can say that it is a bigger Chidush to say that if he vowed to bring from barley is obligated!</p>
<p class="bas indent3"><span class="nm">i.</span>If one said 'I will bring a Minchah from lentils', it seems that he accepted to bring a normal Minchah, the he had regret, and therefore ended 'from lentils'. The Halachah is, his first statement takes effect;</p>
<p class="bas indent3"><span class="nm">ii.</span>If one vowed to bring from barley, one might have thought that he is unsure whether or not this may be done, just like the Omer and Minchas Sotah are from barley, and he intends to be exempt if one cannot bring! The Mishnah teaches that this is not so. He is obligated even in this case.</p>
