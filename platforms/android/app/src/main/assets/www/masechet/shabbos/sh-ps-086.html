<p class="bas indent1"><span class="nm">(a)</span>(Mishnah) (After a woman has relations, the semen may drip out over the course of several days; when it does, it touches her externally and is Metamei her, unless it already putrefied.) Question: What is the source that if a woman emits semen [within] three days [after relations], she becomes Teme'ah?</p>
<p class="bas indent1"><span class="nm">(b)</span><span class="cl">Answer:</span> "Heyu Nechonim li'Shloshes Yomim" (Benei Yisrael abstained from relations three days before Matan Torah, in order that no woman would become Tamei on account of emitting semen).</p>
<p class="bas indent1"><span class="nm">(c)</span><span class="cl">Question:</span> What is the source that one may [Mechalel Shabbos, if necessary to] wash [a baby, even (Rashi)] on the third day from circumcision?</p>
<p class="bas indent1"><span class="nm">(d)</span><span class="cl">Answer:</span> "Va'Yhi va'Yom ha'Shelishi bi'Hyosam Ko'avim" (this shows that one is very weak on the third day).</p>
<p class="bas indent1"><span class="nm">(e)</span><span class="cl">Question:</span> What is the source to tie a red thread on the head of the Se'ir ha'Mishtale'ach (the goat sent to Azazel on Yom Kipur)?</p>
<p class="bas indent1"><span class="nm">(f)</span><span class="cl">Answer:</span> "Im Yihyu Chata'eichem ka'Shanim ka'Sheleg Yalbinu".</p>
<p class="bas indent1"><span class="nm">(g)</span><span class="cl">Question:</span> What is the source that anointing is [forbidden] like drinking on Yom Kipur?</p>
<p class="bas indent1"><span class="nm">(h)</span><span class="cl">Answer:</span> "Va'Tavo cha'Mayim b'Kirbo vecha'Shemen b'Atzmosav".</p>
<p class="bas indent1"><span class="nm">(i)</span><span class="cl">(Gemara) Question:</span> The Reisha is unlike R. Elazar ben Azaryah, the Seifa is like him!</p>
<p class="bas indent2"><span class="nm">1.</span>R. Elazar holds that semen is Tahor on the third day.</p>
<p class="bas indent1"><span class="nm">(j)</span><span class="cl">Answer #1:</span> The opinion that prefers establishing a Mishnah like one Tana [even if this causes a difficulty, e.g. one must alter the text or give different reasons for the Reisha and Seifa] establishes it like R. Elazar ben Azaryah - the text of the Reisha must say 'Tahor'.</p>
<p class="bas indent1"><span class="nm">(k)</span><span class="cl">Answer #2:</span> The opinion that prefers establishing the Reisha and Seifa like different Tana'im [rather than enduring a difficulty] says that the Reisha is Chachamim, the Seifa is R. Elazar.</p>
<p class="bas indent1"><span class="nm">(l)</span><span class="cl">(Beraisa - R. Elazar ben Azaryah):</span> If a woman emits semen on the third day, she is Tehorah;</p>
<p class="bas indent1"><span class="nm">(m)</span>(An Onah is a day or night.) R. Yishmael says, [an expulsion on day three is Tamei, on day four is Tahor -] sometimes the Tum'ah lasts for four Onos (if her last relations were at the end of the day), sometimes for five (if her last relations were at dawn), sometimes for six (if her last relations were just after nightfall);</p>
<p class="bas indent1"><span class="nm">(n)</span>R. Akiva says, it is always Tamei for five Onos;</p>
<p class="bas indent2"><span class="nm">1.</span>If she had relations after some of the Onah already elapsed, we add that amount of time to the beginning of the sixth Onah.</p>
<p class="bas indent1"><span class="nm">(o)</span><span class="cl">Question (Rabanan):</span> (All agree that Matan Torah was on Shabbos.) We understand R. Elazar ben Azaryah - he holds like the Chachamim who say that abstention [from relations] began on Thursday [evening, so any expulsion of semen on Shabbos would be [at least] the third day from relations and hence Tahor];</p>
<p class="bas indent2"><span class="nm">1.</span>We understand R. Yishmael - he holds like R. Yosi, who says that abstention began on Wednesday [evening, Shabbos was [at least] the fourth day from relations];</p>
<p class="bas indent2"><span class="nm">2.</span>But which Tana does R. Akiva hold like [and what is his source that it depends on Onos]?</p>
<p class="bas indent1"><span class="nm">(p)</span><span class="cl">Answer (Rav Papa):</span> He holds like R. Yosi, like Rav Ada bar Ahavah taught, that Moshe always ascended on Har Sinai at daybreak and descended right away (he told them at dawn on Wednesday, so there were five Onos before Shabbos);</p>
<p class="bas indent2"><span class="nm">1.</span>"Va'Yashkem Moshe ba'Boker va'Ya'al El Har Sinai" teaches that he ascended at dawn;</p>
<p class="bas indent2"><span class="nm">2.</span>"Lech Red v'Alisa" equates descending to ascending - just like he ascended at dawn, he descended at dawn.</p>
<p class="bas indent1"><span class="nm">(q)</span><span class="cl">Question:</span> Why did Moshe need to tell them in the morning? (Any time before evening would have sufficed!)</p>
<p class="bas indent2"><span class="nm">1.</span><span class="cl">(Rav Huna):</span> Yisraelim are Kedoshim, they do not have relations during the day.</p>
<p class="bas indent1"><span class="nm">(r)</span><span class="cl">Answer:</span> Rava taught that in a dark house, it is permitted; also, a Chacham is always permitted, he will cover with his garment in order that it will be dark.</p>

<p class="bas subject"><span class="nm">2)</span>THE <i>TAHARAH</i> REQUIRED TO RECEIVE THE TORAH</p>
<p class="bas indent1"><span class="nm">(a)</span><span class="cl">Question:</span> [All agree that an expulsion up until Shabbos could be Tamei, some women could not immerse until Shabbos night -] if so, they were Tevulos Yom (they were not totally Tehoros)!</p>
<p class="bas indent1"><span class="nm">(b)</span><span class="cl">Answer (Abaye bar Ravin and Rav Chanina bar Avin):</span> Indeed, this teaches that the Torah was given to Tevulos Yom!</p>
<p class="bas indent1"><span class="nm">(c)</span><span class="cl">Question (Ravina):</span> Was the Torah given to Tevulos Yom (some did not immerse until Shabbos), or was it merely fitting to be given to Tevulos Yom?</p>
<p class="bas indent1"><span class="nm">(d)</span><span class="cl">Answer (Mereimar):</span> It was fitting to be given to Tevulos Yom. (But actually, everyone immersed before Shabbos, and no one had to immerse again on Shabbos due to a subsequent expulsion of semen.)</p>
<p class="bas indent1"><span class="nm">(e)</span><span class="cl">Question #1:</span> Since Torah was fitting to be given to Tevulos Yom, they could have immersed on Shabbos night and the Torah could have been given that same night! (Rashi - we ask against R. Akiva - it seems that Matan Torah was delayed until morning, because six Onos are required! Tosfos - we also ask against R. Elazar and R. Yishmael, who say that it depends on the number of days - the delay teaches that it depends on Onos, and another Onah was needed!)</p>
<p class="bas indent1"><span class="nm">(f)</span><span class="cl">Answer #1 (R. Yitzchak):</span> "Lo mi'Rosh ba'Seser Dibarti" (Hash-m did not [want to] speak covertly with Yisrael).</p>
<p class="bas indent1"><span class="nm">(g)</span><span class="cl">Question #2 (against R. Akiva):</span> [Why did they have to abstain from Wednesday morning?] They could have [had relations on Wednesday during the day, and] immersed on Shabbos morning, before Matan Torah</p>
<p class="bas indent1"><span class="nm">(h)</span><span class="cl">Answer #1 (R. Yitzchak):</span> It would be improper that while [most of] Benei Yisrael are heading to receive the Torah, others are going to immerse.</p>
<p class="bas indent1"><span class="nm">(i)</span><span class="cl">Answer #2 (to Questions (e) and (g) - R. Chiya b'Rebbi Aba):</span> Chachamim argue with R. Yishmael and R. Akiva - they say that semen is always Tamei for six full Onos (therefore 72 hours of abstention were required, from Wednesday morning until Shabbos morning).</p>
<p class="bas indent1"><span class="nm">(j)</span><span class="cl">(Rav Chisda):</span> The argument is about semen emitted by a woman, but all agree that semen emitted by a man (that never entered a woman) is Tamei as long as it is moist (it is still capable of being Mazri'a (impregnanting).).</p>
<p class="bas indent1"><span class="nm">(k)</span><span class="cl">Question (Rav Sheshes - Beraisa):</span> "V'Chol Beged v'Chol Or Asher Yihyeh Alav Shichvas <i>Zera</i>" - this excludes putrefied semen (it cannot Mazri'a).</p>
<p class="bas indent2"><span class="nm">1.</span><span class="cl">Suggestion:</span> It came from a man (and it is Tamei if it is moist, even if it putrefied)!</p>
<p class="bas indent1"><span class="nm">(l)</span><span class="cl">Answer:</span> No, came from a woman.</p>
<p class="bas indent1"><span class="nm">(m)</span><span class="cl">Question #1 (Rav Papa):</span> If semen of a Yisrael is inside a Nochris, for how long is it Tamei?</p>
<p class="bas indent2"><span class="nm">1.</span>Perhaps semen putrefies in a Yisraelis after three days, for the bodies of Yisraelim are warm, for they are fearful about Mitzvos - but a Nochris is cool, it does not putrefy so quickly;</p>
<p class="bas indent2"><span class="nm">2.</span>Or, perhaps bodies of Nochrim are equally warm, for they eat Shekatzim u'Rmashim (insects and swarming creatures)?</p>
<p class="bas indent1"><span class="nm">(n)</span><span class="cl">Question #2:</span> If also in a Nochris it putrefies after three days because they eat Shekatzim u'Rmashim, if it is in an animal, what is the law?</p>
<p class="bas indent2"><span class="nm">1.</span>There is a corridor before a woman's womb, the semen is insulated and stays warm - animals have no corridor, the semen will not putrefy so quickly;</p>
<p class="bas indent2"><span class="nm">2.</span>Or, perhaps this does not make a difference!</p>
<p class="bas indent1"><span class="nm">(o)</span>This question is not resolved.</p>
<p class="bas subject"><span class="nm">3)</span>WHEN WAS THE TORAH GIVEN?</p>
<p class="bas indent1"><span class="nm">(a)</span><span class="cl">(Beraisa):</span> The Aseres ha'Dibros were given on the sixth of Sivan;</p>
<p class="bas indent1"><span class="nm">(b)</span>R. Yosi says, they were given on the seventh.</p>
<p class="bas indent1"><span class="nm">(c)</span><span class="cl">(Rava):</span> All agree that Benei Yisrael came to Midbar Sinai on Rosh Chodesh Sivan:</p>
<p class="bas indent2"><span class="nm">1.</span>It says "Ba'Yom <i>ha'Zeh</i> Ba'u Midbar Sinai", like it says "Ha'Chodesh <i>ha'Zeh</i> Lachem Rosh Chodoshim" - just like the latter refers to Rosh Chodesh, also the former.</p>
<p class="bas indent1"><span class="nm">(d)</span>All agree that Matan Torah was on Shabbos - it says "Zachor Es Yom ha'Shabbos Lekadsho", like it says "...Zachor Es Yom ha'Zeh" - just like the latter refers to the day itself [that it was said], also the former;</p>
<p class="bas indent1"><span class="nm">(e)</span>They argue about which day [of the week] was Rosh Chodesh.</p>
