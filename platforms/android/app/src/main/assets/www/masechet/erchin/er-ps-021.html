<p class="bas subject"><span class="nm">1)</span><i>HEKDESH</i> OF A RENTED HOUSE</p>
<p class="bas indent1"><span class="nm">(a)</span><span class="cl">Version #2 - (Beraisa):</span> If Reuven rented his house to Shimon and Tzara'as came on it, even if the Kohen declared the house to be Muchlat, Reuven can say "the house is there (I need not find another for you)." (Tosfos - if he says so, Shimon need not pay the rent.)</p>
<p class="bas indent1"><span class="nm">(b)</span>If the house was taken apart, Reuven must supply another house for Shimon.</p>
<p class="bas indent1"><span class="nm">(c)</span>If the one who lives there (Shimon) was Makdish it, he pays rent to Hekdesh.</p>
<p class="bas indent1"><span class="nm">(d)</span><span class="cl">Question:</span> How can Shimon be Makdish it?!</p>
<p class="bas indent2"><span class="nm">1.</span>"Ish Ki Yakdish Beiso Kodesh" teaches that one can be Makdish only things like his house, which are in his full possession.</p>
<p class="bas indent1"><span class="nm">(e)</span><span class="cl">Answer:</span> It means that if Reuven was Makdish it, the one who lives there (Shimon) pays rent to Hekdesh.</p>
<p class="bas indent1"><span class="nm">(f)</span><span class="cl">Question #1:</span> Shimon may not live there, lest he transgress Me'ilah! (This is like the opinion that Me'ilah applies to something that was built onto the ground.)</p>
<p class="bas indent1"><span class="nm">(g)</span><span class="cl">Question #2:</span> Why does he pay rent to Hekdesh? After transgressing Me'ilah, the house (Rashi; Tosfos - the rental) becomes Chulin!</p>
<p class="bas indent1"><span class="nm">(h)</span><span class="cl">Answer to both questions:</span> The case is, Reuven was Makdish the rent money <i>when it will be paid</i>.</p>
<p class="bas indent1"><span class="nm">(i)</span><span class="cl">Version #2A - Question:</span> One cannot be Makdish a Davar she'Lo Ba l'Olam!</p>
<p class="bas indent1"><span class="nm">(j)</span><span class="cl">Answer (Rav Yehudah):</span> The Beraisa is R. Meir, who says that one can be Makdish a Davar she'Lo Ba l'Olam.</p>
<p class="bas indent1"><span class="nm">(k)</span><span class="cl">Version #2B - Question (Rav Papa):</span> Is the Beraisa like R. Meir, who says that one can be Makdish a Davar she'Lo Ba l'Olam?</p>
<p class="bas indent1"><span class="nm">(l)</span><span class="cl">Answer (Abaye):</span> (Yes!) Who else could it be like?</p>
<p class="bas subject"><span class="nm">2)</span>COLLATERAL FOR <i>KODSHIM</i></p>
<p class="bas indent1"><span class="nm">(a)</span><span class="cl">(Mishnah):</span> If one owes Erchin, we (Beis Din) take a security from him.</p>
<p class="bas indent1"><span class="nm">(b)</span>If one is obligated to bring a Chatas or Asham, we do not take a security from him. (Surely he will be zealous to bring it, to get atonement);</p>
<p class="bas indent2"><span class="nm">1.</span>If he must bring an Olah or Shelamim, we take a security from him (lest he delay bringing it).</p>
<p class="bas indent1"><span class="nm">(c)</span>Even though "li'Rtzono" teaches that he does not get atonement until he consents to offer it, we force him until he consents.</p>
<p class="bas indent1"><span class="nm">(d)</span>Similarly, if one must divorce his wife, we force him until he says "I want" (to divorce her, and authorizes Sheluchim to write and give a Get).</p>
<p class="bas indent1"><span class="nm">(e)</span><span class="cl">(Gemara - Rav Papa):</span> Sometimes we take a security from one obligated to bring a Chatas or Asham. Sometimes, we do not take a security from one who must bring an Olah or Shelamim;</p>
<p class="bas indent2"><span class="nm">1.</span>We take a security from one who must bring Chatas Nazir;</p>
<p class="bas indent3"><span class="nm">i.</span>It was taught that if a Nazir shaved after bringing any of his three Korbanos, he was Yotzei. Once the blood of one of them is thrown, he is permitted to drink wine and become Tamei.</p>
<p class="bas indent3"><span class="nm">ii.</span>Since the Chatas is not necessary for atonement, we are concerned lest he delay bringing it.</p>
<p class="bas indent2"><span class="nm">2.</span>We do not take a security for Olas Yoledes.</p>
<p class="bas indent2"><span class="nm">3.</span><span class="cl">Objection:</span> Presumably, because the Torah commands about it before her Chatas, it is Me'akev her Taharah. (Therefore, she will not delay bringing it);</p>
<p class="bas indent3"><span class="nm">i.</span>However, Rava taught that the Torah puts the Olah first (only) regarding Mikra'ah! (Rashi - the Torah mentions it first. Others explain that one must be Makdish the Olah first. Alternatively, if she has only one bird now, she may offer it for the Olah and bring the Chatas when she finds another, but if both are in front of us, the Chatas is offered first.)</p>
<p class="bas indent2"><span class="nm">4.</span><span class="cl">Correction:</span> Rather, we do not take a security for Olas Metzora;</p>
<p class="bas indent3"><span class="nm">i.</span><span class="cl">(R. Yishmael, son of R. Yochanan ben Berokah):</span> Just like the Chatas and Asham of a Metzora are Me'akev Taharah, also the Olah.</p>
<p class="bas subject"><span class="nm">3)</span>CONSENT TO BRING A <i>KORBAN</i></p>
<p class="bas indent1"><span class="nm">(a)</span><span class="cl">(Mishnah):</span> Even though he does not get atonement until he consents...</p>
<p class="bas indent1"><span class="nm">(b)</span><span class="cl">(Beraisa):</span> "Yakriv" teaches that if Shimon must bring an Olah, Beis Din forces him to bring it;</p>
<p class="bas indent2"><span class="nm">1.</span><span class="cl">Suggestion:</span> Perhaps we force him against his will!</p>
<p class="bas indent2"><span class="nm">2.</span><span class="cl">Rejection:</span> "Li'Rtzono."</p>
<p class="bas indent2"><span class="nm">3.</span><span class="cl">Question:</span> How do we fulfill both verses?</p>
<p class="bas indent2"><span class="nm">4.</span><span class="cl">Answer:</span> We force him until he says "I want to bring it."</p>
<p class="bas indent1"><span class="nm">(c)</span><span class="cl">(Shmuel):</span> His consent is required for an Olah.</p>
<p class="bas indent1"><span class="nm">(d)</span><span class="cl">Question:</span> We already learn this from the Mishnah! "Even though 'li'Rtzono' teaches that he does not get atonement until he consents to offer it, we force him until he consents."</p>
<p class="bas indent1"><span class="nm">(e)</span><span class="cl">Answer:</span> Shmuel teaches about a case in which Reuven supplies an Olah on behalf of Shimon;</p>
<p class="bas indent2"><span class="nm">1.</span>One might have thought that we need Shimon's consent only to take an animal of Shimon, but not to take another's animal (since Shimon does not lose);</p>
<p class="bas indent2"><span class="nm">2.</span>Shmuel teaches that this is not so. Perhaps Shimon prefers to get atonement from his own money.</p>
<p class="bas indent1"><span class="nm">(f)</span><span class="cl">Question (Beraisa #1):</span> If Reuven said "it is Alai to bring Ploni's Chatas or Asham" (and brought it), Ploni was Yotzei only if he consented.</p>
<p class="bas bbbline">21b----------------------------------------21b</p>
<p class="bas indent2"><span class="nm">1.</span>Regarding Olah and Shelamim, Ploni is Yotzei whether or not he consented.</p>
<p class="bas indent1"><span class="nm">(g)</span><span class="cl">Answer (Shmuel):</span> The Beraisa refers to <i>offering</i> a Korban without consent. I taught that consent is required to be <i>Makdish</i> an Olah on behalf of Ploni.</p>
<p class="bas indent1"><span class="nm">(h)</span>Shmuel argues with Ula;</p>
<p class="bas indent2"><span class="nm">1.</span><span class="cl">(Ula):</span> The only difference between Chatas and Olah (regarding consent) is that consent is required to be Makdish a Chatas, but it is not required to be Makdish an Olah;</p>
<p class="bas indent2"><span class="nm">2.</span>Both Chatas and Olah require consent to offer it.</p>
<p class="bas indent1"><span class="nm">(i)</span><span class="cl">Question (against Ula - Beraisa #2):</span> If Reuven said "it is Alai to bring Ploni's Chatas, Asham, Olah or Shelamim" (and brought it), Ploni was Yotzei only if he consented.</p>
<p class="bas indent1"><span class="nm">(j)</span><span class="cl">Answer #1 (on behalf of Shmuel):</span> This discusses consent to offer the Korban.</p>
<p class="bas indent1"><span class="nm">(k)</span><span class="cl">Answer #2 (on behalf of Ula):</span> This discusses consent to be Makdish a Korban.</p>
<p class="bas indent1"><span class="nm">(l)</span><span class="cl">(Rav Papa):</span> The Beraisos do not contradict each other. One of them discusses consent to be Makdish a Korban, and the other discusses consent to offer a Korban;</p>
<p class="bas indent1"><span class="nm">(m)</span>The Beraisos do not refute Shmuel and Ula:</p>
<p class="bas indent2"><span class="nm">1.</span>Shmuel establishes Beraisa #1 to discuss consent to be Makdish a Korban, and Beraisa #2 discusses consent to offer it;</p>
<p class="bas indent2"><span class="nm">2.</span>Ula establishes them vice-versa.</p>
<p class="bas indent1"><span class="nm">(n)</span>Shmuel and Ula argue with each other.</p>
<p class="bas indent1"><span class="nm">(o)</span><span class="cl">Objection:</span> This is obvious!</p>
<p class="bas indent1"><span class="nm">(p)</span><span class="cl">Answer:</span> One might have thought that Shmuel means that consent is needed (to offer, and) <i>also</i> to be Makdish, even though Beraisa #1 refutes him. Rav Papa teaches that this is not so.</p>
<p class="bas indent1"><span class="nm">(q)</span><span class="cl">(Mishnah):</span> Similarly, we force a man to divorce...</p>
<p class="bas indent1"><span class="nm">(r)</span><span class="cl">(Rav Sheshes):</span> If one gives a Moda'ah about a Get (tells witnesses that he does not intend to divorce, merely to escape coercion), the Moda'ah is valid (the Get is void).</p>
<p class="bas indent1"><span class="nm">(s)</span><span class="cl">Question:</span> This is obvious!</p>
<p class="bas indent1"><span class="nm">(t)</span><span class="cl">Answer:</span> The case is, he was forced and later consented;</p>
<p class="bas indent2"><span class="nm">1.</span>One might have thought that his consent is a Bitul (retraction) of the Moda'ah. Rav Sheshes teaches that this is not so.</p>
<p class="bas indent2"><span class="nm">2.</span>If it were a Bitul, the Mishnah could have said only "until he gives a Get". Rather, it says "until he says 'I want'", to teach that he must explicitly nullify any Moda'ah.</p>
<p class="perekline">PEREK SHUM HA'YESOMIM</p>
<p class="bas subject"><span class="nm">4)</span>HACHRAZAH</p>
<p class="bas indent1"><span class="nm">(a)</span><span class="cl">(Mishnah):</span> The Hachrazah (period during which Beis Din publicly announces that they are selling property) of orphans is 30 days;</p>
<p class="bas indent1"><span class="nm">(b)</span>The Hachrazah of Hekdesh is 60 days;</p>
<p class="bas indent1"><span class="nm">(c)</span>Beis Din announces in the morning and evening.</p>
<p class="bas indent1"><span class="nm">(d)</span><span class="cl">(Gemara) Question:</span> Why do they announce morning and evening?</p>
<p class="bas indent1"><span class="nm">(e)</span><span class="cl">Answer (Rav Yehudah):</span> This is when workers go out to and return from work;</p>
<p class="bas indent2"><span class="nm">1.</span>One who wants to buy can ask his workers to look at the property in the morning, and ask them about it at night (Rashi. Tosfos explains vice-versa.)</p>
<p class="bas indent1"><span class="nm">(f)</span><span class="cl">Support (Beraisa):</span> The Hachrazah of orphans is 30 days. The Hachrazah of Hekdesh is 60 days. They announce in the morning and evening, when workers go out to and return from work.</p>
<p class="bas indent2"><span class="nm">1.</span>They announce the characteristics of the field, its borders, how much it produces, the price, and whether the money will be used to pay a Kesuvah or a creditor.</p>
<p class="bas indent1"><span class="nm">(g)</span><span class="cl">Question:</span> Why must they announce what the money will be used for?</p>
<p class="bas indent1"><span class="nm">(h)</span><span class="cl">Answer:</span> Some people prefer paying a creditor, for he is not fussy about the quality of the coins. Others prefer paying a Kesuvah, for (usually) a widow prefers to receive the money little by little.</p>
