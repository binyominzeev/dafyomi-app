<div class="subject"><span class="nm">1)</span><p>WHEN IS TEMED LIKE WATER?</p></div>
<div class="indent1"><span class="nm">(a)</span><p><span class="cl">Answer #1 (Rabah bar Avuha):</span> Chachamim and R. Yehudah argue when it fermented; our Mishnah is R. Yehudah.</p></div>
<div class="indent2"><span class="nm">1.</span><p><span class="cl">Support (R. Yosi bar Chanina):</span> The argument is when it fermented.</p></div>
<div class="indent2"><span class="nm">2.</span><p><span class="cl">(Rav Nachman citing Rabah bar Avuha):</span> If one bought Temed with money of Ma'aser Sheni; and later, it fermented, the purchase was valid.</p></div>
<div class="indent3"><span class="nm">i.</span><p><span class="cl">Question:</span> What is the reason?</p></div>
<div class="indent3"><span class="nm">ii.</span><p><span class="cl">Answer:</span> This shows retroactively that it was not mere water.</p></div>
<div class="indent2"><span class="nm">3.</span><p><span class="cl">Question:</span> The Mishnah says that if it did not ferment, one may not buy it with Ma'aser money, and it disqualifies a Mikveh. Perhaps if it was left, it would have fermented!</p></div>
<div class="indent2"><span class="nm">4.</span><p><span class="cl">Answer (Rabah):</span> The case is, some of it was left around, and it did not ferment.</p></div>
<div class="indent1"><span class="nm">(b)</span><p><span class="cl">Answer #2 (Rava):</span> The Mishnah is R. Yochanan ben Nuri.</p></div>
<div class="indent2"><span class="nm">1.</span><p><span class="cl">(Mishnah):</span> If a Kortov (a 64th of a Lug, about 6-10 milliliters) of wine fell into water, and the volume of the mixture is three Lugim, and it looks like wine, the mixture does not disqualify a Mikveh;</p></div>
<div class="indent2"><span class="nm">2.</span><p>Similarly, if a Kortov of milk fell into water, and the volume of the mixture is three Lugim, and it looks like water, the mixture does not disqualify a Mikveh;</p></div>
<div class="indent2"><span class="nm">3.</span><p>R. Yochanan ben Nuri says, it all depends on the appearance. (If it looks like water, it disqualifies a Mikveh.)</p></div>
<div class="indent3"><span class="nm">i.</span><p>Also here, R. Yochanan ben Nuri says that it all depends on the appearance. The appearance and taste of unfermented Temed is like water.</p></div>
<div class="indent1"><span class="nm">(c)</span><p>Rav Nachman argues with R. Elazar.</p></div>
<div class="indent2"><span class="nm">1.</span><p><span class="cl">(R. Elazar):</span> R. Yehudah and Chachamim agree that one may not tithe an unfermented Temed from another unfermented Temed.</p></div>
<div class="indent2"><span class="nm">2.</span><p>R. Elazar holds that they argue about unfermented Temed;</p></div>
<div class="indent3"><span class="nm">i.</span><p>R. Yehudah does not allow taking Ma'aseros for one unfermented Temed from another one, lest one of them is Tevel and the other is exempt, and the Ma'aser is invalid.</p></div>
<div class="indent1"><span class="nm">(d)</span><p><span class="cl">(Beraisa):</span> If (Tamei) Temed is unfermented, one can be Metaher it through Hashakah (touching it to a Mikveh, because it is considered water).</p></div>
<div class="bbbline">26b----------------------------------------26b</p></div>
<div class="indent1"><span class="nm">(e)</span><p><span class="cl">(Rava):</span> This works only if it became Tamei after it became Temed; but if Tamei water was used to make Temed, touching it to a Mikveh does not help.</p></div>
<div class="indent1"><span class="nm">(f)</span><p><span class="cl">Objection (Rav Gaviha):</span> Presumably, it doesn't work if the water was Tamei from the beginning because the water is at the bottom, and the wine floats on top, so the water does not touch the Mikveh;</p></div>
<div class="indent2"><span class="nm">1.</span><p>The same applies if it became Tamei after it was Temed!</p></div>
<div class="indent2"><span class="nm">2.</span><p>Rather, we must say that the water and wine mix together, so touching to the Mikveh helps no matter when it became Tamei.</p></div>
<div class="subject"><span class="nm">2)</span><p>DIFFERENT AGES OF GIRLS</p></div>
<div class="indent1"><span class="nm">(a)</span><p><span class="cl">(Mishnah):</span> Whenever a man can sell his daughter to be a slave (she is the proper age), there is no fine if she is seduced or raped. Whenever there is a fine for a girl, her father cannot sell her.</p></div>
<div class="indent1"><span class="nm">(b)</span><p><span class="cl">(Gemara - Rav Yehudah):</span> Our Mishnah is R. Meir, but Chachamim say that sometimes there is a fine for a girl who can be sold.</p></div>
<div class="indent2"><span class="nm">1.</span><p><span class="cl">(Beraisa - R. Meir):</span> A girl can be sold from birth until Na'arus (when she brings two pubic hairs after 12 years of age), but there is no fine for her. During the next six months (after which she becomes a Bogeres) there is a fine for her, but she cannot be sold.</p></div>
<div class="indent2"><span class="nm">2.</span><p>Chachamim say, there is a fine for her from the age of three years until Bagrus.</p></div>
<div class="indent2"><span class="nm">3.</span><p><span class="cl">Question:</span> Do they hold that there is a fine, but she cannot be sold?!</p></div>
<div class="indent2"><span class="nm">4.</span><p><span class="cl">Answer:</span> They mean that, there is a fine for her even at times when she may be sold (they agree that she can be sold from birth until Na'arus).</p></div>
<div class="indent1"><span class="nm">(c)</span><p><span class="cl">(Mishnah):</span> When a girl (is at an age when she) can do Mi'un, she cannot do Chalitzah. When she can do Chalitzah, she cannot do Mi'un.</p></div>
<div class="indent1"><span class="nm">(d)</span><p><span class="cl">(Gemara - Rav Yehudah):</span> Our Mishnah is R. Meir, but Chachamim say that there is a girl that can do Mi'un, even though she is at an age that she can do Chalitzah.</p></div>
<div class="indent2"><span class="nm">1.</span><p><span class="cl">(Beraisa - R. Meir):</span> A girl can do Mi'un until she brings two hairs (Na'arus. She can do Chalitzah anytime after this);</p></div>
<div class="indent2"><span class="nm">2.</span><p>R. Yehudah says, she can do Mi'un until the hairs are long.</p></div>
<div class="subject"><span class="nm">3)</span><p>SEPARATING BETWEEN SHABBOS AND YOM TOV</p></div>
<div class="indent1"><span class="nm">(a)</span><p><span class="cl">(Mishnah):</span> Whenever the Shofar is sounded (between Shabbos and Yom Tov), we do not say Havdalah (in prayer, or over a cup of wine). Whenever we say Havdalah, we do not sound the Shofar.</p></div>
<div class="indent2"><span class="nm">1.</span><p>When Yom Tov is on Erev Shabbos, the Shofar is sounded (before Shabbos begins), but there is no Havdalah (in Kidush of Shabbos). When Yom Tov is after Shabbos, we make Havdalah (in Kidush of Yom Tov) and do not sound the Shofar.</p></div>
<div class="indent3"><span class="nm">i.</span><p>The text of this Havdalah is 'ha'Mavdil (He who separates) Bein Kodesh l'Kodesh';</p></div>
<div class="indent3"><span class="nm">ii.</span><p>R. Dosa says, it is 'ha'Mavdil Bein Kodesh Chamur l'Kodesh ha'Kal (between severe Kodesh and light Kodesh).'</p></div>
<div class="indent1"><span class="nm">(b)</span><p><span class="cl">(Gemara) Question:</span> How is the Shofar sounded?</p></div>
<div class="indent1"><span class="nm">(c)</span><p><span class="cl">Answer #1 (Rav Yehudah):</span> He blows Teki'ah (a long note) and concludes this note with Teru'ah (shorter notes).</p></div>
<div class="indent1"><span class="nm">(d)</span><p><span class="cl">Answer #2 (Rav Asi):</span> He blows Teki'ah and Teru'ah in the same breath.</p></div>
<div class="indent2"><span class="nm">1.</span><p>Rav Asi enacted in Hutzal to blow according to his opinion.</p></div>
<div class="indent1"><span class="nm">(e)</span><p><span class="cl">Question (against both answers - Beraisa):</span> If Yom Tov falls on Erev Shabbos we blow Teki'ah, but not Teru'ah.</p></div>
<div class="indent2"><span class="nm">1.</span><p><span class="cl">Suggestion:</span> We do not blow Teru'ah at all.</p></div>
<div class="indent1"><span class="nm">(f)</span><p><span class="cl">Answer #1 (for Rav Yehudah):</span> We do not blow Teru'ah by itself, rather, amidst the Teki'ah.</p></div>
<div class="indent1"><span class="nm">(g)</span><p><span class="cl">Answer #2 (for Rav Asi):</span> We do not blow Teru'ah in a second breath, rather it is in the same breath as the Teki'ah.</p></div>
<div class="indent1"><span class="nm">(h)</span><p><span class="cl">(Mishnah):</span> When Yom Tov is after Shabbos...</p></div>
<div class="indent1"><span class="nm">(i)</span><p><span class="cl">Question:</span> At what place in Havdalah do we say 'ha'Mavdil Bein Kodesh...'?</p></div>
<div class="indent1"><span class="nm">(j)</span><p><span class="cl">Answer #1 (Rav Yehudah and Rav Nachman):</span> We say this at the end of Havdalah.</p></div>
<div class="indent1"><span class="nm">(k)</span><p><span class="cl">Answer #2 (Rav Sheshes brei d'Rav Idi):</span> We say it also in the beginning.</p></div>
<div class="indent2"><span class="nm">1.</span><p>The Halachah does not follow Rav Sheshes.</p></div>
<div class="indent1"><span class="nm">(l)</span><p><span class="cl">(Mishnah - R. Dosa):</span> He says 'Hamavdil Bein Kodesh Chamur l'Kodesh ha'Kal'.</p></div>
<div class="indent2"><span class="nm">1.</span><p>The Halachah does not follow R. Dosa.</p></div>
<div class="indent1"><span class="nm">(m)</span><p><span class="cl">(R. Zeira):</span> When Yom Tov falls in the middle of the week, the text of Havdalah is 'He who separates between Kodesh and profane, and between light and darkness, and between Yisrael and the Nochrim, and between Shabbos and the six days of work.'</p></div>
<div class="indent1"><span class="nm">(n)</span><p><span class="cl">Question:</span> Why is this said for Yom Tov?</p></div>
<div class="indent1"><span class="nm">(o)</span><p><span class="cl">Answer:</span> One lists the various separations that Hash-m makes.</p></div>
