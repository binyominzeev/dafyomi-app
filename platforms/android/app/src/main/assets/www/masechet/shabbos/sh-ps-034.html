<p class="bas indent1"><span class="nm">(a)</span>R. Shimon asked if anything needs to be fixed; they told him about a place of Safek Tum'ah, it was a burden for Kohanim to go around it.</p>
<p class="bas indent1"><span class="nm">(b)</span><span class="cl">R. Shimon:</span> Does anyone here know if this place was once Tahor (if so, it is not a cemetery, we may use it</p>
<p class="bas indent1"><span class="nm">(c)</span><span class="cl">An elder:</span> Here, R. Yochanan ben Zakai (a Kohen) cut lupines (legumes) of Terumah (the place is Tahor).</p>
<p class="bas indent1"><span class="nm">(d)</span><span class="cl">Version #1 (Tosfos):</span> R. Shimon also made a Tikun (like Yakov. He spread a wet sheet; where the ground was soft, it absorbed water from the sheet.) The soft places he marked Tamei (they were dug), the hard places he marked Tahor.</p>
<p class="bas indent1"><span class="nm">(e)</span><span class="cl">Version #2 (Rashi):</span> He also cut [and cast down] lupines of Terumah - miraculously, the Tum'ah came to the surface (Chachmas Mano'ach - it moved, causing the dirt above it to soften, showing where is Tamei, so R. Shimon would not Metamei the Terumah), enabling him to mark off the place of Tum'ah.) (end of Version #2)</p>
<p class="bas indent1"><span class="nm">(f)</span><span class="cl">The elder:</span> R. Shimon just declared the cemetery to be Tahor!</p>
<p class="bas indent1"><span class="nm">(g)</span><span class="cl">R. Shimon:</span> Had you not been with us (in the matter of demarcating the Tum'ah), or had you been with us but did not agree with us, you could dissent - but you were with us and agreed with us! If you dissent people will say that harlots adorn one another, all the more so Chachamim! (Anaf Yosef - they adorn each other, even though they compete with each other, for the more harlots the more lust in the world - all the more so regarding Kedushah, assent among Chachamim increases dearness of Torah and Yir'as Shamayim! Chasam Sofer - in spite of the competition and mutual hatred, harlots adorn one another in order to be adorned - people will say that Chachamim are craftier, all the more so they honor each other (hoping to receive honor in return, i.e. that is why you initially agreed), and when one sees another succeed, he rebels! Ben Yehoyada - in spite of the hatred, harlots adorn one another to prevent a cheapening of the profession - likewise, you should not belittle Chachamim, this belittles yourself!)</p>
<p class="bas indent2"><span class="nm">1.</span>R. Shimon put his eyes on him - the elder died.</p>
<p class="bas indent1"><span class="nm">(h)</span>R. Shimon went out and saw Yehudah ben Gerim (who had repeated R. Shimon's words, leading to the decree), and was amazed that he was still alive - he put his eyes on him, and turned him into a pile of bones.</p>
<p class="bas subject"><span class="nm">2)</span>THINGS THAT MUST BE DONE BEFORE DARK</p>
<p class="bas indent1"><span class="nm">(a)</span><span class="cl">(Mishnah):</span> A man must say three things in his house shortly before dark [on Erev Shabbos] - Have you tithed? Have you made an Eiruv? Light Ner Shabbos!</p>
<p class="bas indent1"><span class="nm">(b)</span>If it is Safek dark (i.e. Safek night), one may not tithe Vadai (definite) Tevel, immerse Kelim, or light Ner Shabbos;</p>
<p class="bas indent2"><span class="nm">1.</span>[At this time] one may tithe Demai (Safek Tevel), make an Eiruv, and do Hatmanah (wrap food to keep it warm).</p>
<p class="bas indent1"><span class="nm">(c)</span><span class="cl">(Gemara) Question:</span> What is the source that one must say command to light Ner Shabbos?</p>
<p class="bas indent1"><span class="nm">(d)</span><span class="cl">Answer (R. Yehoshua ben Levi):</span> "V'Yodata Ki Shalom Oholecha u'Fokadta Nacvha v'Lo Secheta" (you should verify that Ner Shabbos, which promotes Shalom, is lit).</p>
<p class="bas indent1"><span class="nm">(e)</span><span class="cl">(Rabah bar bar Chanah):</span> Even though one must say these, he should say them gently, in order that people will hearken.</p>
<p class="bas indent1"><span class="nm">(f)</span><span class="cl">(Rav Ashi):</span> I know this from reasoning even before I heard Rabah's teaching!</p>
<p class="bas indent1"><span class="nm">(g)</span><span class="cl">Question (Mishnah):</span> One must say three things shortly before dark;</p>
<p class="bas indent2"><span class="nm">1.</span><span class="cl">Inference:</span> When it is Safek dark, all are forbidden (one of them is to make an Eiruv).</p>
<p class="bas indent2"><span class="nm">2.</span><span class="cl">Contradiction (Seifa):</span> When it is Safek night, one may make an Eiruv.</p>
<p class="bas indent1"><span class="nm">(h)</span><span class="cl">Answer (R. Aba):</span> One may not make Eiruv Techumim at this time, one may make Eiruv Chatzeros. (On Shabbos one must stay within his Techum, i.e. 2000 Amos in every direction from his residence or city; one can fix his residence anywhere inside his Techum, to allow walking 2000 Amos from there, by leaving an Eiruv (food) there for <i>all</i> of Bein ha'Shemashos. Mid'Rabanan, one may not carry from one Reshus ha'Yachid to a different one, unless Eiruv Chatzeros (food jointly owned by the residents of the Reshuyos) was left.)</p>
<p class="bas indent2"><span class="nm">1.</span><span class="cl">(Rava):</span> If Reuven and Shimon each told Levi 'Make an Eiruv (Tosfos - Techumim; Rashi - Chatzeros) for me', and Levi made Reuven's Eiruv before Shabbos and Shimon's Eiruv Bein ha'Shemashos, [even] if Reuven's Eiruv was eaten Bein ha'Shemashos and Shimon's was eaten after dark, both of them are valid.</p>
<p class="bas indent2"><span class="nm">2.</span><span class="cl">Question:</span> Either way you say, this is difficult!</p>
<p class="bas indent3"><span class="nm">i.</span>If Bein ha'Shemashos is day, Reuven's Eiruv should be invalid; if it is night, Shimon's Eiruv should be invalid!</p>
<p class="bas indent2"><span class="nm">3.</span><span class="cl">Answer:</span> [It is Safek day, Safek night -] the law of Eiruv is mid'Rabanan, we are lenient about a Safek.</p>
<p class="bas indent1"><span class="nm">(i)</span><span class="cl">(Rava):</span> After dark, Hatmanah is forbidden [even] in something that does not add heat - this is a decree lest one heat the food before wrapping it.</p>
<p class="bas indent1"><span class="nm">(j)</span><span class="cl">Question (Abaye):</span> If so, it should be forbidden even Bein ha'Shemashos!</p>
<p class="bas indent1"><span class="nm">(k)</span><span class="cl">Answer (Rava):</span> We are not concerned for this, for normally pots are already boiling Bein ha'Shemashos.</p>
<p class="bas bbbline">34b----------------------------------------34b</p>
<p class="bas indent1"><span class="nm">(l)</span><span class="cl">(Rava):</span> Hatmanah is forbidden in something that adds heat, even before Shabbos - this is a decree lest one wrap in hot ashes and coals.</p>
<p class="bas indent1"><span class="nm">(m)</span><span class="cl">Question (Abaye):</span> Before Shabbos this is permitted!</p>
<p class="bas indent1"><span class="nm">(n)</span><span class="cl">Answer (Rava):</span> We decree lest he will stoke the coals after dark.</p>
<p class="bas subject"><span class="nm">3)</span>BEIN HA'SHEMASHOS</p>
<p class="bas indent1"><span class="nm">(a)</span><span class="cl">(Beraisa):</span> We are unsure if part of Bein ha'Shemashos is day and part is night, or if all of it is day, or if all of it is night - therefore, we are stringent, perhaps it spans two days (this will be explained).</p>
<p class="bas indent1"><span class="nm">(b)</span><span class="cl">Question:</span> When is Bein ha'Shemashos? (The Gemara will discuss whether we ask about its beginning or its duration.)</p>
<p class="bas indent1"><span class="nm">(c)</span><span class="cl">Answer #1 (R. Yehudah):</span> It is after sundown, as long as Penei Mizrach (simply translated, the eastern sky) is reddish; when the horizon darkens but not the middle of the sky, it is Bein ha'Shemashos (the Gemara will ask about this); when the middle of the sky is as dark as the horizon, it is night;</p>
<p class="bas indent1"><span class="nm">(d)</span><span class="cl">Answer #2 (R. Nechemyah):</span> It lasts the amount of time needed to walk [1000 Amos, i.e.] half a Mil (nine or 11 minutes) after sunset - after this, it is night;</p>
<p class="bas indent1"><span class="nm">(e)</span><span class="cl">Answer #3 (R. Yosi):</span> It lasts as long as the blink of an eye (a moment), immediately after it comes, it is night - one cannot know the exact moment.</p>
<p class="bas indent1"><span class="nm">(f)</span><span class="cl">(Beraisa):</span> We are stringent, perhaps it spans two days.</p>
<p class="bas indent1"><span class="nm">(g)</span><span class="cl">Question:</span> What difference does it make if it spans two days?</p>
<p class="bas indent1"><span class="nm">(h)</span><span class="cl">Answer (Rav Huna brei d'Rav Yehoshua):</span> This affects Tum'ah:</p>
<p class="bas indent2"><span class="nm">1.</span><span class="cl">(Mishnah):</span> If a man saw [emissions of Zivah] during Bein ha'Shemashos on two consecutive days (e.g. Sunday and Monday), he is in doubt regarding Tum'ah and Korban. (If the sightings were separated by a day, i.e. he saw Sunday during the day and Monday night; he is not a Zav, he is just a Ba'al Keri; in any other case, the sightings were on the same or consecutive days, he is a Zav; if the sightings spanned all three days, e.g. Sunday's sighting was partially during the day and partially at night, and Monday's sighting was at night, he must bring a Korban.)</p>
<p class="bas indent2"><span class="nm">2.</span>If he saw during one Bein ha'Shemashos, he is a Safek Zav (if the sighting was partially during the day and partially at night, he is a Zav; if not, he is just a Ba'al Keri).</p>
<p class="bas indent1"><span class="nm">(i)</span><span class="cl">Question:</span> [R. Yehudah said that] Bein ha'Shemashos is from sundown, as long as the eastern sky is reddish - this implies that once the horizon darkens, it is night;</p>
<p class="bas indent2"><span class="nm">1.</span>But then he says that when the horizon is dark but not the middle of the sky, it is Bein ha'Shemashos!</p>
<p class="bas indent1"><span class="nm">(j)</span><span class="cl">Answer #1 (Rabah):</span> It means, Bein ha'Shemashos begins at sundown and lasts as long as Penei Mizrach is reddish - when the horizon is dark but not the middle of the sky, this is also Bein ha'Shemashos;</p>
<p class="bas indent2"><span class="nm">1.</span>When the middle of the sky is as dark as the horizon, it is night.</p>
<p class="bas indent1"><span class="nm">(k)</span><span class="cl">Answer #2 (Rav Yosef):</span> After sundown, as long as Penei Mizrach is reddish, it is still day; when the horizon is dark but not the middle of the sky, this is also Bein ha'Shemashos; when the middle of the sky is as dark as the horizon, it is night.</p>
<p class="bas indent1"><span class="nm">(l)</span>This is consistent with their argument regarding the duration of Bein ha'Shemashos (Rabah holds that it is longer than Rav Yosef says).</p>
<p class="bas indent1"><span class="nm">(m)</span><span class="cl">Question:</span> How long does Bein ha'Shemashos last?</p>
<p class="bas indent1"><span class="nm">(n)</span><span class="cl">Answer #1 (Rabah):</span> It is the time to walk three parts of a Mil.</p>

<p class="bas indent2"><span class="nm">2.</span><span class="cl">Answer #1:</span> It means, three half-Milim (3000 Amos).</p>
<p class="bas indent2"><span class="nm">3.</span><span class="cl">Rejection:</span> If so, he would have said one and a half Milim!</p>
<p class="bas indent2"><span class="nm">4.</span><span class="cl">Answer #2:</span> It means, three thirds of a Mil.</p>
<p class="bas indent2"><span class="nm">5.</span><span class="cl">Rejection:</span> If so, he would have said one Mil!</p>
