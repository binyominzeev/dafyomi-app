<div class="subject"><span class="nm">1)</span><p>IF PESACH WAS OFFERED FOR SOMEONE B'DERECH RECHOKAH (cont.)</p></div>
<div class="indent1"><span class="nm">(a)</span><p><span class="cl">Support (Rav Sheshes, for himself - Beraisa - R. Akiva):</span> The Torah equates Tamei and Derech Rechokah - just like Tamei had the ability to bring Pesach [b'Tum'ah] but the Torah disallows, also Derech Rechokah.</p></div>
<div class="indent1"><span class="nm">(b)</span><p><span class="cl">Rejection (Rav Nachman):</span> R. Akiva holds that we do not slaughter and Zorek for a Tamei Sheretz, even though he could eat at night, therefore he also says that we do not slaughter for Derech Rechokah, even if he could [get to Yerushalayim to] eat at night;</p></div>
<div class="indent2"><span class="nm">1.</span><p>I hold that we slaughter and Zorek for a Tamei Sheretz, therefore we also slaughter for Derech Rechokah, if he will be able to eat at night.</p></div>
<div class="indent1"><span class="nm">(c)</span><p><span class="cl">(Beraisa #1):</span> One brings Pesach Sheni if on Pesach Rishon he [or she] was a Zav, Zavah, Metzora, Nidah, Bo'el Nidah, Yoledes, Shogeg, Ones, Mezid, Tamei, or b'Derech Rechokah.</p></div>
<div class="indent1"><span class="nm">(d)</span><p><span class="cl">Question:</span> Since the law is the same, why does the Torah specify Tamei?</p></div>
<div class="indent1"><span class="nm">(e)</span><p><span class="cl">Objection:</span> Obviously, it needed to specify Tamei to teach that he may not bring Pesach Rishon!</p></div>
<div class="indent1"><span class="nm">(f)</span><p><span class="cl">Correction:</span> Rather, why does the Torah specify Derech Rechokah?</p></div>
<div class="indent1"><span class="nm">(g)</span><p><span class="cl">Answer:</span> This is to exempt him from Kares.</p></div>
<div class="indent1"><span class="nm">(h)</span><p>This is like Rav Nachman (if the Tana held that Derech Rechokah may not bring, he would be just like Tamei! Rav Sheshes is not refuted - he holds like R. Akiva.)</p></div>
<div class="subject"><span class="nm">2)</span><p>THE OBLIGATION TO BRING PESACH SHENI</p></div>
<div class="indent1"><span class="nm">(a)</span><p><span class="cl">Contradiction:</span> Beraisa #1 lists women that [must] bring Pesach Sheni - but another Beraisa exempts!</p></div>
<div class="indent2"><span class="nm">1.</span><p><span class="cl">(Beraisa #2) Question:</span> We know that one who was Tamei Mes or b'Derech Rechokah brings Pesach Sheni - what is the source for a Zav or Metzora or Bo'el Nidah]?</p></div>
<div class="indent2"><span class="nm">2.</span><p><span class="cl">Answer:</span> We learn from "Ish Ish" (we do not include females)!</p></div>
<div class="indent1"><span class="nm">(b)</span><p><span class="cl">Resolution:</span> Beraisa #1 is like R. Yosi [who says that Pesach Sheni is obligatory for women - 91B], Beraisa #2 is like R. Yehudah and R. Shimon [who, respectively, say that it is Reshus or does not apply to her].</p></div>
<div class="indent1"><span class="nm">(c)</span><p><span class="cl">(Beraisa - Rebbi):</span> One is Chayav Kares for Pesach Rishon; one is Chayav Kares for Pesach Sheni;</p></div>
<div class="indent1"><span class="nm">(d)</span><p>R. Noson says, one is Chayav Kares for Pesach Rishon; one is exempt for Pesach Sheni;</p></div>
<div class="indent1"><span class="nm">(e)</span><p>R. Chananya ben Akavya says, one is not Chayav Kares even for Pesach Rishon unless he does not bring Pesach Sheni [b'Mezid].</p></div>
<div class="indent1"><span class="nm">(f)</span><p>This is like they (Rebbi and R. Noson) taught elsewhere:</p></div>
<div class="indent2"><span class="nm">1.</span><p><span class="cl">(Beraisa - Rebbi):</span> If a Nochri converted or a minor matured between Pesach Rishon and Sheni, he must bring Pesach Sheni</p></div>
<div class="indent2"><span class="nm">2.</span><p>R. Noson says, only those who were obligated to bring Pesach Rishon are commanded about Pesach Sheni.</p></div>
<div class="indent2"><span class="nm">3.</span><p>Rebbi holds that Pesach Sheni is an independent obligation [for anyone who did not bring Pesach Rishon], even for one who was not commanded about Pesach Rishon;</p></div>
<div class="indent2"><span class="nm">4.</span><p>R. Noson holds that it is compensation for the Rishon, but it does not fix [exempt for failure to bring] the Rishon;</p></div>
<div class="indent2"><span class="nm">5.</span><p>R. Chananya holds that it fixes [his failure to bring] the Rishon.</p></div>
<div class="indent1"><span class="nm">(g)</span><p>They learn from the same verse - "Veha'Ish Asher Hu Tahor..."</p></div>
<div class="indent2"><span class="nm">1.</span><p>Rebbi holds that "V'Chodal La'asos ha'Pesach v'Nichresah" refers to the Rishon; there is also Kares "<i>Ki</i> Korban Hash-m Lo Hikriv b'Mo'ado" - <i>if</i> he did not bring the Sheni (Ki can mean 'if').</p></div>
<div class="indent2"><span class="nm">2.</span><p><span class="cl">Question:</span> How does he know that "Chet'o Yisa" (the next words) means Kares?</p></div>
<div class="bbbline">93b----------------------------------------93b</p></div>
<div class="indent2"><span class="nm">3.</span><p><span class="cl">Answer:</span> [The Torah says that Megadef gets Kares -] he holds that Megadef is blasphemy (cursing Hash-m), and it says regarding blasphemy "V'Nosa Chet'o" - we learn Kares for Pesach Sheni from a Gezerah Shavah "Chet'o-Chet'o."</p></div>
<div class="indent2"><span class="nm">4.</span><p>R. Noson holds that "Ki" means 'because' - "V'Chodal La'asos ha'Pesach v'Nichresah (one who does not bring the Rishon gets Kares)... Ki (because) Korban Hash-m Lo Hikriv b'Mo'ado;"</p></div>
<div class="indent2"><span class="nm">5.</span><p><span class="cl">Question:</span> How does he expound "Chet'o Yisa"?</p></div>
<div class="indent2"><span class="nm">6.</span><p><span class="cl">Answer:</span> He holds that Megadef is not blasphemy [rather, it is one who sings to idolatry, so there is no explicit source for Kares for blasphemy] - we learn Kares for blasphemy from the Gezerah Shavah, from Pesach [Rishon].</p></div>
<div class="indent2"><span class="nm">7.</span><p>R. Chananya holds that "Ki" means 'if' - "V'Chodal La'asos ha'Pesach v'Nichresah...Ki Korban Hash-m Lo Hikriv b'Mo'ado," if he did not bring the Sheni.</p></div>
<div class="indent2"><span class="nm">8.</span><p><span class="cl">Question:</span> How does he expound "Chet'o Yisa"?</p></div>
<div class="indent2"><span class="nm">9.</span><p><span class="cl">Answer:</span> It teaches like we said [for R. Noson, to Mechayev Kares for blasphemy].</p></div>
<div class="indent1"><span class="nm">(h)</span><p>Therefore, if one did not bring either Pesach:</p></div>
<div class="indent2"><span class="nm">1.</span><p>If he was Mezid both times, all agree that he is Chayav Kares; if he was Shogeg both times, all agree that he is exempt;</p></div>
<div class="indent2"><span class="nm">2.</span><p>If the first was Mezid and the second Shogeg, Rebbi and R. Noson are Mechayev, and R. Chananya exempts;</p></div>
<div class="indent2"><span class="nm">3.</span><p>If the first was Shogeg and the second Mezid, Rebbi is Mechayev, and R. Noson and R. Chananya exempt.</p></div>
<div class="subject"><span class="nm">3)</span><p>WHAT IS CONSIDERED DERECH RECHOKAH?</p></div>
<div class="indent1"><span class="nm">(a)</span><p><span class="cl">(Mishnah) Question:</span> What is considered Derech Rechokah?</p></div>
<div class="indent1"><span class="nm">(b)</span><p><span class="cl">Answer #1 (R. Akiva):</span> It is further away than the city Modi'im;</p></div>
<div class="indent1"><span class="nm">(c)</span><p><span class="cl">Answer #2 (R. Eliezer):</span> It is outside the threshold of the Azarah.</p></div>
<div class="indent1"><span class="nm">(d)</span><p><span class="cl">R. Yosi:</span> There is a dot on the letter 'Hei' [in "Rechokah"], to teach that he need not be truly far, rather, even outside the threshold of the Azarah (dots always detract from the simple understanding).</p></div>
<div class="indent1"><span class="nm">(e)</span><p><span class="cl">(Gemara - Ula):</span> It is 15 Mil (a Mil is 2000 Amos, about a kilometer) from Modi'im to Yerushalayim.</p></div>
<div class="indent1"><span class="nm">(f)</span><p>He holds like Rabah bar bar Chanah:</p></div>
<div class="indent2"><span class="nm">1.</span><p><span class="cl">(Rabah bar bar Chanah):</span> An average person can walk 40 Mil in a day [of Nisan, when the night and day are equal - see note in Appendix].</p></div>
<div class="indent2"><span class="nm">2.</span><p>He walks five Mil from dawn until sunrise, and five from sunset until Tzeis ha'Kochavim - this leaves 30 Mil from sunrise to sunset, 15 in the morning and 15 in the afternoon.</p></div>
<div class="indent1"><span class="nm">(g)</span><p>This is based on what Ula taught elsewhere:</p></div>
<div class="indent2"><span class="nm">1.</span><p><span class="cl">(Ula):</span> Derech Rechokah is one who cannot reach the Azarah at the time of slaughter. (Rashi - if he is past Modi'im at midday, he cannot reach the Azarah by sunset - Dam Kodshim becomes Pasul at sunset. Rambam - if he is past Modi'im at sunrise, he cannot reach the Azarah by midday, which [mid'Oraisa] is the beginning of the time to slaughter.)</p></div>
<div class="indent1"><span class="nm">(h)</span><p><span class="cl">Question:</span> We said that a person can walk five Mil from dawn until sunrise - what is the source of this?</p></div>
<div class="indent1"><span class="nm">(i)</span><p><span class="cl">Answer:</span> It says "U'Chemo ha'Shachar Alah va'Ya'itzu ha'Mal'achim b'Lot" (Lot left Sedom at dawn), and "Ha'Shemesh Yotzo Al ha'Aretz v'Lot Ba Tzo'arah;"</p></div>
<div class="indent2"><span class="nm">1.</span><p><span class="cl">(R. Chanina):</span> I saw the place - Sedom was five Mil from Tzo'ar.</p></div>
<div class="indent1"><span class="nm">(j)</span><p><span class="cl">(Ula):</span> Derech Rechokah is one who cannot reach the Azarah at the time of slaughter.</p></div>
<div class="indent1"><span class="nm">(k)</span><p><span class="cl">(Rav Yehudah):</span> It is one who cannot arrive [in Yerushalayim] in time to eat Pesach (before midnight according to R. Elazar ben Azaryah, and before dawn according to R. Akiva, mid'Oraisa. Mid'Rabanan R. Akiva forbids eating after midnight, but this does not affect Derech Rechokah.)</p></div>
<div class="indent1"><span class="nm">(l)</span><p><span class="cl">Question #1 (Rabah, against Ula):</span> You say that it is one who cannot reach the Azarah at the time of slaughter - but you yourself say that we slaughter and do Zerikah for one who is Tamei Sheretz, even though he cannot reach the Azarah at the time of slaughter!</p></div>
<div class="indent1"><span class="nm">(m)</span><p><span class="cl">Question #2 (Rabah, against Rav Yehudah):</span> He says that Derech Rechokah is one who cannot arrive in time to eat - but he himself says that we do not slaughter for one who is Tamei Sheretz, even though he can reach the Azarah at the time of slaughter!</p></div>
<div class="indent1"><span class="nm">(n)</span><p><span class="cl">Answer (Ula, for himself):</span> Derech Rechokah exempts a Tahor [who cannot reach the Azarah at the time of slaughter], it is unlike the exemption of a Tamei [which depends on being unable to eat at night].</p></div>
