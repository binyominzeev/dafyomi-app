<p class="bas subject"><span class="nm">1)</span>UNKNOWN <i>TUM'AH</i></p>
<p class="bas indent1"><span class="nm">(a)</span><span class="cl">(Mishnah):</span> If a Nazir shaved (upon completing Nezirus) and then learned that he was Tamei:</p>
<p class="bas indent2"><span class="nm">1.</span>If it was a known Tum'ah, the days he counted are Batel (and he must bring Korbanos of a Nazir Tamei, and be a Nazir again);</p>
<p class="bas indent2"><span class="nm">2.</span>If it was Tum'as ha'Tehom (an unknown Tum'ah), he has fulfilled Nezirus.</p>
<p class="bas indent2"><span class="nm">3.</span>If he found out before shaving, in either case the days he counted are Batel.</p>
<p class="bas indent1"><span class="nm">(b)</span>For example, if he went to immerse in a Mikvah in a cave, and later, Tum'ah was found floating on the water, he is (assumed to be) Tamei;</p>
<p class="bas indent2"><span class="nm">1.</span>If Tum'ah was found buried in the floor of the cave, we distinguish:</p>
<p class="bas indent3"><span class="nm">i.</span>If he was Tahor, and entered the water merely to cool off, he is still Tahor;</p>
<p class="bas indent3"><span class="nm">ii.</span>If he was Tamei Mes, and immersed to complete his Taharah, he is Tamei.</p>
<p class="bas indent2"><span class="nm">2.</span>There is good reason to leave him in his Chazakah (status quo of Tahor or Tamei).</p>
<p class="bas indent1"><span class="nm">(c)</span><span class="cl">(Gemara) Question:</span> What is the source that Tum'as ha'Tehom does not nullify Nezirus?</p>
<p class="bas indent1"><span class="nm">(d)</span><span class="cl">Answer #1 (R. Elazar):</span> "If a Mes will die upon him (a Nazir)" - only if it is clear to him.</p>
<p class="bas indent1"><span class="nm">(e)</span><span class="cl">Answer #2 (Reish Lakish):</span> "If a man will be Tamei Mes, or on a far away Derech (road, and he cannot offer the Korban Pesach)" - just like a road is exposed, only exposed Tum'ah disqualifies an Oseh Pesach (Rambam - one about to offer the Korban Pesach; Rashi - one who offered (Tosfos - slaughtered) it.) (We learn Nazir from Pesach.)</p>
<p class="bas indent1"><span class="nm">(f)</span><span class="cl">Question #1 (Mishnah):</span> Tum'as ha'Tehom is one that no one knew about. If one person anywhere in the world knew, it is not Tum'as ha'Tehom.</p>
<p class="bas indent2"><span class="nm">1.</span>This is like Reish Lakish.</p>
<p class="bas indent2"><span class="nm">2.</span>According to R. Elazar, even if someone knew about the Tum'ah, if it was not clear to the Nazir, it should not cancel Nezirus!</p>
<p class="bas indent1"><span class="nm">(g)</span><span class="cl">Question #2 (Beraisa):</span> If one found a Mes lying across the (entire) width of the path (on which he had walked), he is Tamei regarding Terumah and Kodshim, but Tahor regarding Oseh Pesach and Nezirus.</p>
<p class="bas indent2"><span class="nm">1.</span>Why should there be any difference? (Each opinion had one source, Nazir or Pesach. If we learn from it to the other, we should also learn to Terumah and Kodshim!)</p>
<p class="bas indent1"><span class="nm">(h)</span><span class="cl">Answer #3:</span> Rather, Tum'as ha'Tehom is a tradition from Sinai.</p>
<p class="bas indent1"><span class="nm">(i)</span><span class="cl">(Mishnah):</span> If he found out before shaving (in either case the days he counted are Batel).</p>
<p class="bas indent1"><span class="nm">(j)</span><span class="cl">Question:</span> Who is the Tana of the Mishnah?</p>
<p class="bas indent1"><span class="nm">(k)</span><span class="cl">Answer (R. Yochanan):</span> It is R. Eliezer, who says that the Isurim of Nezirus are in effect until he shaves.</p>
<p class="bas subject"><span class="nm">2)</span>FROM WHEN IS HE <i>TAMEI</i>?</p>
<p class="bas indent1"><span class="nm">(a)</span><span class="cl">Question (Rami bar Chama):</span> If he became Tamei before completing Nezirus, and learned of this after completing Nezirus, what is the law?</p>
<p class="bas indent2"><span class="nm">1.</span>If it depends on when he found out, this was after completion, so he fulfilled Nezirus;</p>
<p class="bas indent2"><span class="nm">2.</span>If it depends on when he became Tamei, this was before completion, so he must be a Nazir again.</p>
<p class="bas bbbline">63b----------------------------------------63b</p>
<p class="bas indent1"><span class="nm">(b)</span><span class="cl">Answer (Rava - Mishnah):</span> If he learned before shaving, in either case days are Batel.</p>
<p class="bas indent2"><span class="nm">1.</span><span class="cl">Question:</span> When did he find out?</p>
<p class="bas indent3"><span class="nm">i.</span>If this was before completing Nezirus, there is no need to teach this!</p>
<p class="bas indent2"><span class="nm">2.</span><span class="cl">Answer:</span> Rather, it was after completing Nezirus (and days are Batel, i.e. we go after when he became Tamei).</p>
<p class="bas indent1"><span class="nm">(c)</span><span class="cl">Question:</span> We can still ask, are all the days Batel, or only seven?</p>
<p class="bas indent1"><span class="nm">(d)</span><span class="cl">Answer:</span> According to Chachamim, all the days are Batel. According to R. Eliezer, Tum'ah after completing Nezirus nullifies only seven days.</p>
<p class="bas indent1"><span class="nm">(e)</span><span class="cl">Question:</span> Perhaps R. Eliezer said so only when he became Tamei after completion. Here, he became Tamei during Nezirus!</p>
<p class="bas indent2"><span class="nm">1.</span>Or, perhaps it depends on when he found out, and this was after completion.</p>
<p class="bas indent1"><span class="nm">(f)</span><span class="cl">Answer (Mishnah):</span> In either case, he nullifies.</p>
<p class="bas indent2"><span class="nm">1.</span>The Mishnah does not distinguish if the Tum'ah was before or after completion (and in the latter case, only seven days are Batel).</p>
<p class="bas subject"><span class="nm">3)</span>WHAT IS TUM'AS HA'TEHOM?</p>
<p class="bas indent1"><span class="nm">(a)</span><span class="cl">(Beraisa):</span> If a Mes was found underneath a road, spanning the width of the road, one who traversed this road is Tamei regarding Terumah, but Tahor regarding Oseh Pesach or Nezirus.</p>
<p class="bas indent1"><span class="nm">(b)</span>This applies only if it spans the entire width. If not, he is Tahor even regarding Terumah. (A Safek Tum'ah in Reshus ha'Rabim is Tahor.)</p>
<p class="bas indent1"><span class="nm">(c)</span>Also, law (a) applies only if the Mes is whole. If the body is broken or in pieces, he is Tahor even for Terumah, for perhaps he walked between the pieces.</p>
<p class="bas indent2"><span class="nm">1.</span>If the body is in a coffin, leniency (c) does not apply. The coffin joins up the pieces, so he is Tamei.</p>
<p class="bas indent2"><span class="nm">2.</span>Also, leniency (c) applies only if he was walking. If he was carrying a burden or riding, he is Tamei.</p>
<p class="bas indent3"><span class="nm">i.</span>One who is walking can avoid touching, moving or towering over the Tum'ah. One carrying a load or riding cannot.</p>
<p class="bas indent1"><span class="nm">(d)</span>Law (a) applies only to Tum'as ha'Tehom. If the Tum'ah was known, he is Tamei even regarding Pesach and Nezirus.</p>
<p class="bas indent1"><span class="nm">(e)</span>Tum'as ha'Tehom is a Tum'ah that no one in the world knew about it. If anyone knew about it, it is not Tum'as ha'Tehom.</p>
<p class="bas indent1"><span class="nm">(f)</span>If the Tum'ah was concealed in straw or stones, it is Tum'as ha'Tehom. If it was not seen because it was in water, it was dark, or it was in a crevice in a rock, it is not Tum'as ha'Tehom.</p>
<p class="bas indent1"><span class="nm">(g)</span>Tum'as ha'Tehom applies only to Mes (Rashi - Tum'as Mes; Rambam - to one who died, not to one who was murdered).</p>
<p class="bas indent1"><span class="nm">(h)</span><span class="cl">(Mishnah):</span> If he descended to immerse...</p>
<p class="bas indent1"><span class="nm">(i)</span>(Doubtful) floating Tum'ah of a Sheretz is Tahor.</p>
<p class="bas indent2"><span class="nm">1.</span><span class="cl">(Beraisa):</span> A Safek (based on) Tum'ah floating in water is (assumed to be) Tahor, whether the water is in a Kli or in the ground;</p>
<p class="bas indent2"><span class="nm">2.</span>R. Shimon says, if it is in a Kli, it is Tamei. In the ground, it is Tahor.</p>
