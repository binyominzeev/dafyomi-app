<p class="dedicationbox">YOMA 52 - Two weeks of study material have been dedicated by Mrs. Estanne Abraham Fawer to honor the Yahrzeit of her father, Rav Mordechai ben Eliezer Zvi (Rabbi Morton Weiner) Z'L, who passed away on 18 Teves 5760. May the merit of supporting and advancing Dafyomi study -- which was so important to him -- during the weeks of his Yahrzeit serve as an Iluy for his Neshamah. </p>

<div class="subject"><span class="nm">1)</span><p>THE AMAH TERAKSIN</p></div>
<div class="indent1"><span class="nm">(a)</span><p><span class="cl">(R. Noson):</span> It was not determined if the Amah T'raksin was part of the Heichal or part of the Kodesh ha'Kodoshim.</p></div>
<div class="indent1"><span class="nm">(b)</span><p><span class="cl">Question (Ravina):</span> Why assume that it was part of either; perhaps it was part of <i>neither</i>!?</p></div>
<div class="indent2"><span class="nm">1.</span><p>If the measurements in the Pesukim are your indication (40 + 20 = 60) thus leaving us unsure where the Amah belongs...</p></div>
<div class="indent2"><span class="nm">2.</span><p>Perhaps the Pesukim are describing interior spaces only, the Amah is part of neither.</p></div>
<div class="indent2"><span class="nm">3.</span><p>This is supported by the Mishnah which counts the interior space (40 and 20) apart from the walls.</p></div>
<div class="indent1"><span class="nm">(c)</span><p><span class="cl">Answer:</span> The doubt is rather about which Kedushah prevailed in the Amah Teraksin.</p></div>
<div class="indent2"><span class="nm">1.</span><p>This is indicated by the doubt raised by R. Yosef Ish Hutzal.</p></div>
<div class="indent2"><span class="nm">2.</span><p>He questioned how to divide the Pasuk "u'Devir be'Soch ha'Bayis mi'Penimah Heichin..."</p></div>
<div class="indent2"><span class="nm">3.</span><p><span class="cl">Question:</span> But Isi b. Yehudah taught only five ambiguous words in the Torah (and "mi'Penimah" is not one of them)?</p></div>
<div class="bbbline">52b----------------------------------------52b</p></div>
<div class="indent3"><span class="nm">i.</span><p>The Beraisa identifies Isi b. Yehudah with Yosef Ish Hutzal.</p></div>
<div class="indent3"><span class="nm">ii.</span><p>It is thus he did not question "mi'Penimah"!?</p></div>
<div class="indent2"><span class="nm">4.</span><p><span class="cl">Answer:</span> There are no others in the Torah, but there are others in Nevi'im.</p></div>
<div class="indent2"><span class="nm">5.</span><p><span class="cl">Question:</span> But we find another ambiguous word in the Torah, "Parim", as reported by R. Chisda!?</p></div>
<div class="indent2"><span class="nm">6.</span><p><span class="cl">Answer:</span> This was R. Chisda's doubt, not shared by Isi b. Yehudah.</p></div>
<div class="subject"><span class="nm">2)</span><p>MISHNAH: THE ENTRY INTO THE KODESH HAKODOSHIM</p></div>
<div class="indent1"><span class="nm">(a)</span><p>The outer (Heichal) curtain was pinned (Perufah) outward at the South, and the inner one was Perufah from the North.</p></div>
<div class="indent1"><span class="nm">(b)</span><p>The Kohen Gadol walked between them until reaching the North.</p></div>
<div class="indent1"><span class="nm">(c)</span><p>Upon entry into the Kodesh ha'Kodoshim he turned South and walked with the Paroches to his left until the Aron.</p></div>
<div class="indent1"><span class="nm">(d)</span><p>Upon reaching the Aron he placed the Machtah with the coals between the Badim, piled the Ketores on the coals and (waited until) the room filled with smoke.</p></div>
<div class="indent1"><span class="nm">(e)</span><p>He reversed himself to leave.</p></div>
<div class="indent1"><span class="nm">(f)</span><p>He prayed briefly (so as not to arouse concern) in the Heichal.</p></div>
<div class="subject"><span class="nm">3)</span><p>THE KODESH HAKODOSHIM OF THE FIRST MIKDASH</p></div>
<div class="indent1"><span class="nm">(a)</span><p><span class="cl">Question:</span> Of which Mikdash is the Mishnah speaking?</p></div>
<div class="indent2"><span class="nm">1.</span><p>If the first, there was no Paroches!</p></div>
<div class="indent2"><span class="nm">2.</span><p>If the second, there was no Aron (which, the Beraisa reports, was one of the items hidden by Yoshiyahu)!</p></div>
<div class="indent3"><span class="nm">i.</span><p>The Beraisa lists and discusses the items placed in Genizah by Yoshiyahu.</p></div>
<div class="indent3"><span class="nm">ii.</span><p>R. Elazar cites the sources for each of the items (Tzintzenes, Shemen, Makel).</p></div>
<div class="indent1"><span class="nm">(b)</span><p><span class="cl">Answer:</span> We are speaking of the Mikdash Sheini and he came not to the Aron but to its place.</p></div>
<div class="indent1"><span class="nm">(c)</span><p><span class="cl">Question:</span> But the Mishnah speaks of between the Badim?!</p></div>
<div class="indent1"><span class="nm">(d)</span><p><span class="cl">Answer:</span> It means as if it were...</p></div>
<div class="subject"><span class="nm">4)</span><p>PILING OR SPREADING THE KETORES</p></div>
<div class="indent1"><span class="nm">(a)</span><p>Our Mishnah supports the opinion that the Kohen Gadol piles (not spreads) the Ketores on the coals.</p></div>
<div class="indent1"><span class="nm">(b)</span><p>The Beraisos seem to contradict one another regarding upon which side of the Machtah he begins to pile the Ketores.</p></div>
<div class="indent1"><span class="nm">(c)</span><p><span class="cl">(Abaye):</span> This is a Machlokes Tana'im and the cited Mishnah (wherein the Kohen Gadol is given instructions) seems to support the view that he began from the side away from himself.</p></div>
