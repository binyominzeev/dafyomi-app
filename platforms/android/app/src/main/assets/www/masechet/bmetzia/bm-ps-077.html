<p class="bas subject"><span class="nm">1)</span>WHEN THERE IS NO WORK TO BE DONE</p>
<p class="bas indent1"><span class="nm">(a)</span><span class="cl">(Rava):</span> If Reuven hired workers to irrigate a field, and it rained (so there is no need to water it), the workers lose;</p>
<p class="bas indent2"><span class="nm">1.</span><span class="cl">Version #1 (Rashi):</span> If a river overflowed and irrigated it, Reuven must pay them like idle workers (he knows that this is prone to happen, so he should have told them).</p>
<p class="bas indent2"><span class="nm">2.</span><span class="cl">Version #2 (Rashba):</span> If a river overflowed and facilitated irrigating it, Reuven must pay them their full wage.</p>
<p class="bas indent1"><span class="nm">(b)</span><span class="cl">(Rava):</span> If Reuven hired workers to irrigate a field, and in the middle of the job, the river dried up:</p>
<p class="bas indent2"><span class="nm">1.</span>If it is not prone to dry up, the workers lose;</p>
<p class="bas indent2"><span class="nm">2.</span>If it is prone to dry up, if the workers are from this city, the workers lose, for they should have known that the river is prone to dry up. If they are not from this city, Reuven pays them like idle workers, for he should have told them.</p>
<p class="bas indent1"><span class="nm">(c)</span><span class="cl">(Rava):</span> If Reuven hired workers for the day, and they finished the job in the middle of the day:</p>
<p class="bas indent2"><span class="nm">1.</span>If he had other work which is easier or just as hard, he may tell them to do it;</p>
<p class="bas indent2"><span class="nm">2.</span>If the only other work he has is harder, he cannot force them to do it. He must pay their full wage.</p>
<p class="bas indent2"><span class="nm">3.</span><span class="cl">Question:</span> He should pay them only like idle workers (for the rest of the day)!</p>
<p class="bas indent2"><span class="nm">4.</span><span class="cl">Answer:</span> Rava discusses workers who carry burdens. (They prefer not to be idle, for) if they are idle from work, they grow weak.</p>
<p class="bas subject"><span class="nm">2)</span>A WORKER WHO QUIT IN THE MIDDLE</p>
<p class="bas indent1"><span class="nm">(a)</span><span class="cl">(Beraisa):</span> (If he quit after doing half) we estimate what he did. If is worth six Dinarim, he gets only four. He may finish the job to get eight.</p>
<p class="bas indent2"><span class="nm">1.</span>Chachamim hold that workers have the upper hand.</p>
<p class="bas indent1"><span class="nm">(b)</span><span class="cl">(Beraisa):</span> He may finish the job to get eight.</p>
<p class="bas indent1"><span class="nm">(c)</span><span class="cl">Objection:</span> This is obvious!</p>
<p class="bas indent1"><span class="nm">(d)</span><span class="cl">Answer:</span> The case is, the price of labor increased. Shimon quit, and Reuven entreated him to finish.</p>
<p class="bas indent2"><span class="nm">1.</span>One might have thought that (since Chachamim say that workers have the upper hand) he agreed only for more wages. The Beraisa teaches that this is not so. Reuven can say, I agreed to feed you nicely.</p>
<p class="bas indent1"><span class="nm">(e)</span><span class="cl">(Beraisa):</span> If his work is worth four (Gra's text - two) Dinarim, he gets four (Gra - two).</p>
<p class="bas indent1"><span class="nm">(f)</span><span class="cl">Objection:</span> This is obvious!</p>
<p class="bas indent1"><span class="nm">(g)</span><span class="cl">Answer:</span> The case is, initially the price of labor was low. Shimon agreed to work for more than the normal wage, and later the price of labor increased.</p>
<p class="bas indent2"><span class="nm">1.</span>One might have thought that (since Chachamim say that workers have the upper hand) Shimon agreed only for more than the going wage. The Beraisa teaches that this is not so. Reuven can say that he agreed to give extra only when the price of labor was low.</p>
<p class="bas indent1"><span class="nm">(h)</span><span class="cl">(Beraisa - R. Dosa):</span> We evaluate the work remaining. If it will cost six Dinarim to finish, he gets only two. He may finish the job to get eight.</p>
<p class="bas indent2"><span class="nm">1.</span>He holds that workers have the lower hand.</p>
<p class="bas indent1"><span class="nm">(i)</span><span class="cl">(Beraisa):</span> He may finish the job to get eight.</p>
<p class="bas indent1"><span class="nm">(j)</span><span class="cl">Objection:</span> This is obvious!</p>
<p class="bas indent1"><span class="nm">(k)</span><span class="cl">Answer:</span> The case is, the price of labor decreased. Reuven cancelled the contract, and Shimon entreated him to let him finish.</p>
<p class="bas indent2"><span class="nm">1.</span>One might have thought that (since R. Dosa says that workers have the lower hand) he agreed only for a lower wage. The Beraisa teaches that this is not so. Shimon can say, I agreed to do very good work.</p>
<p class="bas indent1"><span class="nm">(l)</span><span class="cl">(Beraisa):</span> If his work is worth four (Gra's text - two) Dinarim, he gets four (Gra - two).</p>
<p class="bas indent1"><span class="nm">(m)</span><span class="cl">Objection:</span> This is obvious!</p>
<p class="bas indent1"><span class="nm">(n)</span><span class="cl">Answer (Rav Huna brei d'Rav Nasan):</span> The case is, initially the price of labor was high. They agreed to work for less than the normal wage, and later the price of labor decreased.</p>
<p class="bas indent2"><span class="nm">1.</span>One might have thought that (since R. Dosa says that workers have the lower hand) they agreed for less than the going wage. The Beraisa teaches that this is not so. Shimon can say that he agreed to work for less only when the price of labor was high.</p>
<p class="bas subject"><span class="nm">3)</span>WHAT IS THE <i>HALACHAH</i>?</p>
<p class="bas indent1"><span class="nm">(a)</span><span class="cl">(Rav):</span> The Halachah follows R. Dosa.</p>
<p class="bas indent1"><span class="nm">(b)</span><span class="cl">Contradiction:</span> Rav said that a worker can quit in the middle of the day!</p>
<p class="bas indent2"><span class="nm">1.</span><span class="cl">Suggestion:</span> Perhaps R. Dosa taught only about Kablanim (workers hired to do a specific task), but not about day laborers.</p>
<p class="bas indent2"><span class="nm">2.</span><span class="cl">Rejection (Beraisa):</span> If Reuven hired Shimon, and in the middle of the day, Shimon (heard that he) lost a relative, or he fell ill, if he is a day laborer, he is paid for the part of the day he worked. If he is a Kablan, he is paid for the part of the task that he finished.</p>
<p class="bas bbbline">77b----------------------------------------77b</p>
<p class="bas indent2"><span class="nm">3.</span><span class="cl">Question:</span> Who is the Tana of the Beraisa?</p>
<p class="bas indent3"><span class="nm">i.</span>If it is Chachamim, why must it say that he lost a relative or fell sick? Even without Ones, if he quits in the middle, he has the upper hand!</p>
<p class="bas indent2"><span class="nm">4.</span><span class="cl">Answer #1:</span> Rather, it is R. Dosa. He taught about Kablanim and day laborers.</p>
<p class="bas indent1"><span class="nm">(c)</span><span class="cl">Answer #1 (and Answer #2 to Question #3 - Rav Nachman bar Yitzchak):</span> R. Dosa taught only about Kablanim, but not about day laborers;</p>
<p class="bas indent2"><span class="nm">1.</span>The Beraisa discusses a job that will entail a loss if it is not finished. All agree that he can quit only due to Ones.</p>
<p class="bas indent1"><span class="nm">(d)</span><span class="cl">Objection (Mishnah):</span> Anyone who deviates or retracts has the lower hand.</p>
<p class="bas indent2"><span class="nm">1.</span>We understand 'anyone who deviates has the lower hand.' The Mishnah is R. Yehudah, who argues (78b) with R. Meir about a worker who deviated from what he was asked to do.</p>
<p class="bas indent2"><span class="nm">2.</span><span class="cl">Question:</span> What does 'anyone who retracts has the lower hand' teach?</p>
<p class="bas indent2"><span class="nm">3.</span><span class="cl">Answer #1:</span> It refers to a day laborer, according to R. Dosa!</p>
<p class="bas indent1"><span class="nm">(e)</span><span class="cl">Answer #2:</span> Really, R. Dosa taught about Kablanim and day laborers;</p>
<p class="bas indent2"><span class="nm">1.</span>Rav agrees with R. Dosa regarding Kablanim, he argues about day laborers.</p>
<p class="bas indent1"><span class="nm">(f)</span><span class="cl">Answer #3 (and Answer #2 to Question d:2):</span> (Really, R. Dosa taught only about Kablanim.) 'Anyone who retracts has the lower hand' teaches like the following.</p>
<p class="bas indent2"><span class="nm">1.</span><span class="cl">(Beraisa):</span> If Reuven sold a field to Shimon for 1000, and Shimon paid 200, if Reuven retracts, Shimon has the upper hand. He can demand his money back, or land worth 200;</p>
<p class="bas indent3"><span class="nm">i.</span>Shimon may take Idis (best quantity land).</p>
<p class="bas indent2"><span class="nm">2.</span>If Shimon retracts, Reuven has the upper hand. He can return the money, or give land worth 200.</p>
<p class="bas indent3"><span class="nm">i.</span>He may give Ziburis (worst quantity land).</p>
<p class="bas indent2"><span class="nm">3.</span>R. Shimon ben Gamliel says, we teach them not to retract. Rather, they write a document saying that Shimon bought the field and still owes 800, which he may pay later.</p>
<p class="bas indent1"><span class="nm">(g)</span><span class="cl">(Beraisa):</span> Shimon may take the Idis (of Reuven's property).</p>
<p class="bas indent1"><span class="nm">(h)</span><span class="cl">Question #1:</span> Shimon is a creditor! (He should get Beinonis!)</p>
<p class="bas indent2"><span class="nm">1.</span><span class="cl">(Mishnah):</span> A creditor collects Beinonis (middle quantity land).</p>
<p class="bas indent1"><span class="nm">(i)</span><span class="cl">Question #2:</span> Shimon should take from the land he bought!</p>
<p class="bas indent1"><span class="nm">(j)</span><span class="cl">Answer #1 (to both questions - Rav Nachman bar Yitzchak):</span> The Beraisa means that he collects from the Idis or Ziburis (in the Reisha and Seifa, respectively) of that field.</p>
<p class="bas indent1"><span class="nm">(k)</span><span class="cl">Answer #2 (Rav Acha brei d'Rav Ika):</span> To raise money to buy such an expensive land, Shimon probably had to sell his Metaltelim or small fields at a loss. Therefore, Reuven is considered a Mazik, who pays from Idis.</p>
<p class="bas subject"><span class="nm">4)</span>A SELLER ANXIOUS FOR THE MONEY</p>
<p class="bas indent1"><span class="nm">(a)</span><span class="cl">(Beraisa #1 - R. Shimon ben Gamliel):</span> We teach them not to retract. Rather, they write...</p>
<p class="bas indent1"><span class="nm">(b)</span><span class="cl">Inference:</span> Without writing this, Shimon would not acquire the field!</p>
<p class="bas indent1"><span class="nm">(c)</span><span class="cl">Contradiction (Beraisa #2 - R. Yosi):</span> If Levi gave Shimon a security, and said 'if I retract (from buying), you may keep this', and Shimon said 'if I retract, I will give double your security (worth of the sale item)', their Tanayim take effect;</p>
<p class="bas indent2"><span class="nm">1.</span>This is like R. Yosi holds elsewhere, that Asmachta (an exaggerated promise) takes effect.</p>
<p class="bas indent2"><span class="nm">2.</span>R. Yehudah says, he acquires only as much as the value of the security (and if the buyer retracts, he gets back his security);</p>
<p class="bas indent2"><span class="nm">3.</span><span class="cl">R. Shimon ben Gamliel:</span> They argue when he said 'my security should acquire (like a security. It is not the beginning of payment)';</p>
<p class="bas indent3"><span class="nm">i.</span>However, if Levi bought land and paid half of the price, he acquires it all immediately. The rest of the money can be given years later.</p>
<p class="bas indent1"><span class="nm">(d)</span><span class="cl">Answer:</span> In Beraisa #1, the seller pursues the buyer to get the money. (This shows that he sold only because he needs the money. Since Shimon cannot pay the full amount, he does not acquire, unless they write...) In Beraisa #2, the seller does not show anxiety for the money (so Shimon acquires);</p>
<p class="bas indent2"><span class="nm">1.</span><span class="cl">(Rava):</span> If the seller shows anxiety for the money, the buyer does not acquire (unless he pays right away). If the seller does not show anxiety for the money, the buyer acquires.</p>
<p class="bas indent1"><span class="nm">(e)</span><span class="cl">(Rava):</span> If Reuven borrowed 100 Zuz and paid it back Zuz by Zuz, this is valid payment, but the lender may bear a grudge, for he loses small amounts.</p>
<p class="bas indent1"><span class="nm">(f)</span>A case occurred in which Reuven sold a donkey to Shimon. He showed anxiety for the last Zuz.</p>
<p class="bas indent1"><span class="nm">(g)</span><span class="cl">Question (Rav Ashi):</span> Does Shimon acquire?</p>
<p class="bas indent1"><span class="nm">(h)</span><span class="cl">Answer (Rav Mordechai):</span> Rava taught that one Zuz is like many. He does not acquire.</p>
<p class="bas indent1"><span class="nm">(i)</span><span class="cl">Question (Rav Acha brei d'Rav Yosef):</span> People say in the name of Rava that he acquires!</p>
<p class="bas indent1"><span class="nm">(j)</span><span class="cl">Answer (Rav Ashi):</span> Rava said so when he sells his field due to its poor quality.</p>
