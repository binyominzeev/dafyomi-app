<p class="bas subject"><span class="nm">1)</span>MONEY DEPOSITED WITH A MONEYCHANGER</p>
<p class="bas indent1"><span class="nm">(a)</span><span class="cl">(Mishnah):</span> If Reuven deposited coins with a moneychanger (Shimon):</p>
<p class="bas indent2"><span class="nm">1.</span>If they were wrapped, Shimon may not use them. Therefore (he is like a Shomer Chinam, so) if they were lost, Shimon is exempt.</p>
<p class="bas indent2"><span class="nm">2.</span>If they were loose, he may use it. Therefore (he is like a borrower, so) if they were lost, he is liable.</p>
<p class="bas indent1"><span class="nm">(b)</span>If Reuven deposited coins with a regular person (Levi), whether or not they were wrapped, Levi may not use them. Therefore (he is like a Shomer Chinam, so) if they were lost, Levi is exempt.</p>
<p class="bas indent1"><span class="nm">(c)</span>R. Meir says, a grocer has the law of a regular person;</p>
<p class="bas indent1"><span class="nm">(d)</span>R. Yehudah says, a grocer is like a moneychanger.</p>
<p class="bas indent1"><span class="nm">(e)</span><span class="cl">(Gemara) Question:</span> Why is he forbidden to use them if they are wrapped?! (It is normal to do so. This does not show that he objects to Shimon using them more than when they are loose!)</p>
<p class="bas indent1"><span class="nm">(f)</span><span class="cl">Answer #1 (Rav Asi):</span> They are wrapped and sealed (such that it will be known if it was opened).</p>
<p class="bas indent1"><span class="nm">(g)</span><span class="cl">Version #1 - Answer #2 (Rav Mari):</span> They are tied in an unusual knot.</p>
<p class="bas indent1"><span class="nm">(h)</span><span class="cl">Version #2 - Question (Rav Mari):</span> What is the law if they are tied in an unusual knot?</p>
<p class="bas indent1"><span class="nm">(i)</span>This question is not resolved.</p>
<p class="bas indent1"><span class="nm">(j)</span><span class="cl">(Mishnah):</span> If the coins were loose, he may use it...</p>
<p class="bas indent1"><span class="nm">(k)</span><span class="cl">(Rav Huna):</span> He is liable even for (loss through) Ones.</p>
<p class="bas indent1"><span class="nm">(l)</span><span class="cl">Question:</span> The Mishnah obligates him only if it was lost!</p>
<p class="bas indent1"><span class="nm">(m)</span><span class="cl">Answer:</span> (Elsewhere,) Rabah said 'they were stolen' - by armed robbers. Similarly, we explain 'they were lost' (through Ones), e.g. his ship sank.</p>
<p class="bas indent1"><span class="nm">(n)</span><span class="cl">(Rav Nachman):</span> If it was Ones, he is exempt.</p>
<p class="bas indent1"><span class="nm">(o)</span><span class="cl">Question (Rava):</span> You must hold that he is not a borrower. If so, he is not even a Shomer Sachar (he should be exempt even for loss)!</p>
<p class="bas indent1"><span class="nm">(p)</span><span class="cl">Answer (Rav Nachman):</span> He is a Shomer Sachar` because he benefits from the money (before using it). He knows that if a profitable purchase presents itself, he can use the money.</p>
<p class="bas indent1"><span class="nm">(q)</span><span class="cl">Question (against Rav Huna - Rav Nachman - Beraisa):</span> Reuven (the treasurer of Hekdesh) deposited money (he forgot that it was Hekdesh) with a moneychanger (Shimon):</p>
<p class="bas indent2"><span class="nm">1.</span>If it was wrapped, Shimon knew he may not use it (even though he thought that it was Chulin). Therefore, if he uses it, Reuven did not transgress Me'ilah;</p>
<p class="bas indent2"><span class="nm">2.</span>If it was loose, Shimon (thought he) could use it; therefore, if he used it, Reuven transgressed Me'ilah.</p>
<p class="bas indent2"><span class="nm">3.</span><span class="cl">Summation of question:</span> If Shimon is liable for Ones, he is considered like a borrower. If so, the money left Hekdesh's domain (and Reuven transgressed Me'ilah) even before Shimon uses it!</p>
<p class="bas indent1"><span class="nm">(r)</span><span class="cl">Answer (Rav Huna):</span> Indeed, he is liable even before using it;</p>
<p class="bas indent2"><span class="nm">1.</span>The Beraisa mentioned using it for parallel structure with the previous case.</p>
<p class="bas subject"><span class="nm">2)</span>UNAUTHORIZED USAGE</p>
<p class="bas indent1"><span class="nm">(a)</span><span class="cl">(Mishnah - Beis Shamai):</span> If one was Shole'ach Yad in a deposit, he suffers to pay the decrease and increase in value (if he got rid of it at a later date, he pays its value then or when he first used it, whichever is higher);</p>
<p class="bas indent1"><span class="nm">(b)</span>Beis Hillel say, he pays according to when he removed it;</p>
<p class="bas indent1"><span class="nm">(c)</span>R. Akiva says, he pays its value at the time he is brought to trial.</p>
<p class="bas indent1"><span class="nm">(d)</span><span class="cl">(Gemara - Rabah):</span> If Reuven stole a barrel of wine from Shimon, and originally it was worth one, and in the end, it was worth four, if he broke or drank it, he pays four. If it broke by itself, he pays one.</p>
<p class="bas indent1"><span class="nm">(e)</span><span class="cl">Question:</span> What is the reason?</p>
<p class="bas indent1"><span class="nm">(f)</span><span class="cl">Answer:</span> If it would be intact, he would return it to Shimon. When he breaks or drinks it, he steals it;</p>
<p class="bas indent2"><span class="nm">1.</span><span class="cl">(Mishnah):</span> All thieves pay like at the time of the theft.</p>
<p class="bas indent1"><span class="nm">(g)</span><span class="cl">(Rabah):</span> If it broke by itself, he pays one.</p>
<p class="bas indent1"><span class="nm">(h)</span><span class="cl">Question:</span> What is the reason?</p>
<p class="bas indent1"><span class="nm">(i)</span><span class="cl">Answer:</span> Now, he did nothing to be liable for. His liability is for when he stole it. Then, it was worth one.</p>
<p class="bas indent1"><span class="nm">(j)</span><span class="cl">(Mishnah - Beis Hillel):</span> He pays according to when he removed it.</p>
<p class="bas indent1"><span class="nm">(k)</span><span class="cl">Question:</span> What does this mean?</p>
<p class="bas indent2"><span class="nm">1.</span><span class="cl">Suggestion:</span> It is when he removed it from the world (e.g. ate it).</p>
<p class="bas indent2"><span class="nm">2.</span><span class="cl">Question:</span> What is the case?</p>
<p class="bas indent2"><span class="nm">3.</span><span class="cl">Answer #1:</span> It was worth less when he ate it than when he stole it</p>
<p class="bas indent2"><span class="nm">4.</span><span class="cl">Rejection:</span> No one says so (that he pays the lower price at the end)!</p>
<p class="bas indent3"><span class="nm">i.</span><span class="cl">(Mishnah):</span> All thieves pay like at the time of the theft.</p>
<p class="bas indent2"><span class="nm">5.</span><span class="cl">Answer #2:</span> It was worth more when he ate it than when he stole it.</p>
<p class="bas indent2"><span class="nm">6.</span><span class="cl">Rejection:</span> This is Beis Shamai's opinion!</p>
<p class="bas bbbline">43b----------------------------------------43b</p>
<p class="bas indent1"><span class="nm">(l)</span><span class="cl">Answer #1:</span> Rather, it means when he removed it from the owner's possession.</p>
<p class="bas indent1"><span class="nm">(m)</span><span class="cl">Objection:</span> If so, Rabah's holds like Beis Shamai!</p>
<p class="bas indent1"><span class="nm">(n)</span><span class="cl">Answer #2:</span> (Really, Beis Hillel mean when he removed it from the world.) All agree about when the value increases (that he pays the higher value);</p>
<p class="bas indent2"><span class="nm">1.</span>They argue about when it decreases in value (not about theft, rather, about Shelichus Yad);</p>
<p class="bas indent2"><span class="nm">2.</span>Beis Shamai say that Shelichus Yad applies even without Chisaron. Therefore, he acquires liability for it like a Gazlan from when he took it. <i>His</i> object decreased in value;</p>
<p class="bas indent2"><span class="nm">3.</span>Beis Hillel say that Shelichus Yad is only if there was Chisaron. He becomes a Gazlan only when he removed it. The owner's object decreased in value.</p>
<p class="bas indent1"><span class="nm">(o)</span><span class="cl">Question:</span> If so, Rava's law (Shelichus Yad does not require Chisaron) is like Beis Shamai!</p>
<p class="bas indent1"><span class="nm">(p)</span><span class="cl">Answer #3:</span> The case is, he moved it so that chicks will climb on it. They argue about whether or not one who borrows without permission is considered a Gazlan.</p>
<p class="bas indent2"><span class="nm">1.</span>Beis Shamai say that he is. He is a Gazlan from when he moved it, his object decreased in value;</p>
<p class="bas indent2"><span class="nm">2.</span>Beis Hillel say that he is not a Gazlan. He did not become a Gazlan until (he removed it, when) it was worth less.</p>
<p class="bas indent1"><span class="nm">(q)</span><span class="cl">Objection:</span> Rava taught that one who borrows without permission is considered a Gazlan. This is like Beis Shamai!</p>
<p class="bas indent1"><span class="nm">(r)</span><span class="cl">Answer #4:</span> Rather, they argue about increased value due to changes in the item itself. Beis Shamai say that the owner receives it, and Beis Hillel says that the Gazlan gets it.</p>
<p class="bas indent1"><span class="nm">(s)</span>The following Tana'im also argue about this.</p>
<p class="bas indent2"><span class="nm">1.</span><span class="cl">(Beraisa - R. Meir):</span> If Reuven stole a sheep and sheared it, and it gave birth, he pays it and its shearings and its offspring;</p>
<p class="bas indent2"><span class="nm">2.</span>R. Yehudah says, he returns only the stolen object itself.</p>
<p class="bas indent2"><span class="nm">3.</span><span class="cl">Support (Mishnah - Beis Shamai):</span> If one makes unauthorized use of a deposit, he suffers to pay the decrease and increase;</p>
<p class="bas indent2"><span class="nm">4.</span>Beis Hillel say, he pays like when he removed it.</p>
<p class="bas subject"><span class="nm">3)</span>THE OPINION OF R. AKIVA</p>
<p class="bas indent1"><span class="nm">(a)</span>R. Akiva says, he pays its value at the time he is brought to trial.</p>
<p class="bas indent1"><span class="nm">(b)</span><span class="cl">(Rav Yehudah):</span> The Halachah follows R. Akiva. R. Akiva admits when there are witnesses (who saw the theft and know what it was worth).</p>
<p class="bas indent1"><span class="nm">(c)</span><span class="cl">Question:</span> What is the reason?</p>
<p class="bas indent1"><span class="nm">(d)</span><span class="cl">Answer:</span> It says "b'Yom Ashmaso (the day of his guilt)." Since witnesses saw him use it, he immediately acquired it like a Gazlan does.</p>
<p class="bas indent1"><span class="nm">(e)</span><span class="cl">(R. Oshiya):</span> R. Yochanan taught that R. Akiva argues even when there are witnesses.</p>
<p class="bas indent1"><span class="nm">(f)</span><span class="cl">Question:</span> What is the reason?</p>
<p class="bas indent1"><span class="nm">(g)</span><span class="cl">Answer:</span> It says "b'Yom Ashmaso", and Beis Din obligates him to pay.</p>
<p class="bas indent1"><span class="nm">(h)</span><span class="cl">(R. Aba bar Papa citing R. Yochanan):</span> The Halachah follows R. Akiva always.</p>
<p class="bas indent1"><span class="nm">(i)</span><span class="cl">Question:</span> What does 'always' mean?</p>
<p class="bas indent1"><span class="nm">(j)</span><span class="cl">Answer #1 (Rav Ashi):</span> It is even when there are witnesses.</p>
<p class="bas indent1"><span class="nm">(k)</span><span class="cl">Answer #2:</span> This includes if he returned it to the place he took it from, and it broke later;</p>
<p class="bas indent2"><span class="nm">1.</span>This teaches that the Halachah is unlike R. Yishmael, who does not require telling the owner.</p>
<p class="bas indent1"><span class="nm">(l)</span><span class="cl">(Rava):</span> The Halachah follows Beis Hillel.</p>
<p class="bas subject"><span class="nm">4)</span>INTENT TO BE <i>SHOLE'ACH</i> <i>YAD</i></p>
<p class="bas indent1"><span class="nm">(a)</span><span class="cl">(Mishnah - Beis Shamai):</span> One who (Tosfos - says that he) intends to be Shole'ach Yad is liable (for any future Ones);</p>
<p class="bas indent1"><span class="nm">(b)</span>Beis Hillel say, he is liable only if he actually took the object - "Im Lo Shalach Yado".</p>
<p class="bas indent2"><span class="nm">1.</span>If he tilted a barrel and took a Revi'is from it, and it broke, he pays only for the Revi'is;</p>
<p class="bas indent2"><span class="nm">2.</span>If he lifted a barrel and took a Revi'is from it, and it broke, he pays for the whole barrel.</p>
