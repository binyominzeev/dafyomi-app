<p class="bas subject"><span class="nm">1)</span>WHEN <i>SHAVEH KESEF</i> MAY BE USED</p>
<p class="bas indent1"><span class="nm">(a)</span><span class="cl">(Mishnah):</span> The 30 Shekalim for a slave, the 50 of a rapist or seducer...</p>
<p class="bas indent1"><span class="nm">(b)</span><span class="cl">Question:</span> Why does the Mishnah repeat 'they are Maneh Tzuri'?</p>
<p class="bas indent1"><span class="nm">(c)</span><span class="cl">Answer:</span> This is due to a rapist and Motzi Shem Ra;</p>
<p class="bas indent2"><span class="nm">1.</span>In those Parshiyos it does not say 'Shekalim'. One might have thought that Zuzim are given. The Mishnah teaches that this is not so. We learn from places where it says "Shekalim".</p>
<p class="bas indent1"><span class="nm">(d)</span><span class="cl">(Mishnah):</span> (All can be paid with money or Shaveh Kesef,) except for (half-)Shekalim.</p>
<p class="bas indent1"><span class="nm">(e)</span><span class="cl">(Beraisa):</span> (Money or Shaveh Kesef can be used for any obligation,) except for (half-)Shekalim, (redemption of) Ma'aser Sheni and Re'ayon (Olas Re'iyah that one must bring on each festival. the same applies to the Shelamim one must bring.)</p>
<p class="bas indent2"><span class="nm">1.</span>Regarding Shekalim, a Mishnah teaches that to facilitate bringing Shekalim to Yerushalayim, they may be converted to gold coins (but not gems. Only currency is guaranteed to retain its value);</p>
<p class="bas indent2"><span class="nm">2.</span>Regarding Ma'aser Sheni it says "v'Tzarta ha'Kesef b'Yadcha";</p>
<p class="bas indent2"><span class="nm">3.</span><span class="cl">(Rav Yosef - Beraisa):</span> Shaveh Kesef (or even a silver nugget) may not be brought to the Azarah to buy Re'ayon, lest it not be worth the required Shi'ur (the Olah and Shelamim must be worth one and two Ma'ah, respectively).</p>
<p class="bas indent1"><span class="nm">(f)</span><span class="cl">(Mishnah):</span> One may not redeem with slaves, documents, land or Hekdesh;</p>
<p class="bas indent1"><span class="nm">(g)</span>If Reuven wrote a document to a Kohen saying 'I owe you five Shekalim (for Pidyon ha'Ben)', his son is not redeemed, and he must pay;</p>
<p class="bas indent2"><span class="nm">1.</span>Therefore, if the Kohen wants (the Yisrael to keep his money, the only solution is that the Kohen takes it, and then) he may return the money.</p>
<p class="bas indent1"><span class="nm">(h)</span>If Reuven separated money for Pidyon ha'Ben and it was lost, he has Acharayus (he must give other money to a Kohen). It says "Yihyeh Lach" (a Kohen will receive the money,) and (only then he is redeemed -) "Pado Sifdeh".</p>
<p class="bas indent1"><span class="nm">(i)</span><span class="cl">(Gemara):</span> Our Mishnah is unlike Rebbi:</p>
<p class="bas indent2"><span class="nm">1.</span><span class="cl">(Beraisa - Rebbi):</span> Anything may be given for Pidyon ha'Ben, except for documents.</p>
<p class="bas indent1"><span class="nm">(j)</span><span class="cl">Question:</span> What is his reason?</p>
<p class="bas indent1"><span class="nm">(k)</span><span class="cl">Answer:</span> He expounds Ribuy and Mi'ut (inclusions and exclusions):</p>
<p class="bas indent2"><span class="nm">1.</span>"U'Fduyav mi'Ben Chodesh" is a Ribuy. "B'Erkecha Kesef Chameshes Shekalim" is a Mi'ut; "Tifdeh" is another Ribuy. We have a Ribuy Mi'ut Ribuy;</p>
<p class="bas indent2"><span class="nm">2.</span>The Ribuyim include everything. The Mi'ut excludes just one thing, i.e. documents.</p>
<p class="bas indent2"><span class="nm">3.</span>Chachamim expound Klal u'Frat (general terms and specific terms);</p>
<p class="bas indent2"><span class="nm">4.</span>"U'Fduyav mi'Ben Chodesh" is a Klal. "B'Erkecha Kesef Chameshes Shekalim" is a Prat; "Tifdeh" is another Klal;</p>
<p class="bas indent2"><span class="nm">5.</span>From a Klal u'Frat u'Chlal we learn everything similar to the Prat, in this case Metaltelim with intrinsic value;</p>
<p class="bas indent3"><span class="nm">i.</span>This excludes land (it is not movable), slaves (it is equated to land) and documents (they have no intrinsic value).</p>
<p class="bas indent1"><span class="nm">(l)</span><span class="cl">Question (Ravina):</span> Rebbi expounds Klal u'Frat!</p>
<p class="bas indent2"><span class="nm">1.</span><span class="cl">(Beraisa - R. Yosi b'Rebbi Yehudah):</span> "Martze'a" (an awl is used to pierce the ear of a slave). What is the source to include a wood chip, thorn, needle, drill or stylus?</p>
<p class="bas indent2"><span class="nm">2.</span><span class="cl">Answer:</span> "V'Lakachta" includes anything that may be taken in the hand.</p>
<p class="bas indent2"><span class="nm">3.</span>Rebbi says, just like Martze'a is of metal, any metal Kli may be used.</p>
<p class="bas indent2"><span class="nm">4.</span><span class="cl">Question:</span> What do they argue about?</p>
<p class="bas indent2"><span class="nm">5.</span><span class="cl">Answer:</span> Rebbi expounds Klal u'Frat, and R. Yosi bar Yehudah expound Ribuy and Mi'ut.</p>
<p class="bas indent1"><span class="nm">(m)</span><span class="cl">Answer (Mereimar):</span> Indeed, normally Rebbi expounds Klal u'Frat. Here is different, like Tana d'Vei R. Yishmael taught:</p>
<p class="bas indent2"><span class="nm">1.</span><span class="cl">(Tana d'Vei R. Yishmael):</span> "Ba'Mayim... ba'Mayim" (teaches about in which bodies of water we may eat fish only with fins and scales). Because the Prat is not between the Kelalim, we do not expound according to Klal u'Frat, rather, according to Ribuy u'Mi'ut;</p>
<p class="bas indent2"><span class="nm">2.</span>Chachamim say, when the Prat is not between the Kelalim, we put it between and expound according to Klal u'Frat.</p>
<p class="bas indent1"><span class="nm">(n)</span><span class="cl">(Mishnah):</span> One may not redeem with Hekdesh.</p>
<p class="bas indent1"><span class="nm">(o)</span><span class="cl">Question:</span> This is obvious. Hekdesh does not belong to the one who wants to redeem!</p>
<p class="bas bbbline">51b----------------------------------------51b</p>
<p class="bas indent1"><span class="nm">(p)</span><span class="cl">Answer:</span> The Mishnah means that also Hekdesh cannot be redeemed with slaves, documents or land.</p>
<p class="bas subject"><span class="nm">2)</span>REDEEMING WITH DOCUMENTS</p>
<p class="bas indent1"><span class="nm">(a)</span><span class="cl">(Mishnah):</span> If Reuven wrote a document to a Kohen saying 'I owe you five Shekalim', his son is not redeemed, and he must pay.</p>
<p class="bas indent1"><span class="nm">(b)</span><span class="cl">(Ula):</span> Mid'Oraisa, his son is redeemed when he pays;</p>
<p class="bas indent2"><span class="nm">1.</span>Chachamim decreed that he is not redeemed, lest people say that documents may be used to redeem.</p>
<p class="bas indent1"><span class="nm">(c)</span><span class="cl">(A reciter of Beraisos):</span> His son is redeemed when he pays.</p>
<p class="bas indent1"><span class="nm">(d)</span><span class="cl">(Rav Nachman):</span> Your Stam (anonymous) Beraisa is like R. Yosi b'Rebbi Yehudah (some say like R. Elazar b'Rebbi Shimon), but Chachamim say that he is not redeemed.</p>
<p class="bas subject"><span class="nm">3)</span>RETURNING THE MONEY</p>
<p class="bas indent1"><span class="nm">(a)</span><span class="cl">(Mishnah):</span> Therefore, the Kohen may return the money if he wants.</p>
<p class="bas indent1"><span class="nm">(b)</span>Our Mishnah teaches like (the Seifa of) the following Beraisa;</p>
<p class="bas indent2"><span class="nm">1.</span><span class="cl">(Beraisa):</span> If one gave five Shekalim (in all) to 10 Kohanim at once, he fulfilled the Mitzvah;</p>
<p class="bas indent2"><span class="nm">2.</span>If he gave to one after the other, he fulfilled the Mitzvah. (Rambam - he gave to 10 Kohanim; Tzon Kodoshim's text of Rashi, based on Tosefta 6:4 - he gave the coins to one Kohen, one after the other.)</p>
<p class="bas indent2"><span class="nm">3.</span>If the Kohen took the money and returned it, the Pidyon is valid;</p>
<p class="bas indent2"><span class="nm">4.</span>R. Tarfon used to do so. Chachamim heard, and said 'he fulfilled this law.'</p>
<p class="bas indent2"><span class="nm">5.</span><span class="cl">Question:</span> Is this the only law that R. Tarfon fulfilled?!</p>
<p class="bas indent2"><span class="nm">6.</span><span class="cl">Correction:</span> Rather, he fulfilled <i>even</i> this law.</p>
<p class="bas indent2"><span class="nm">7.</span>R. Chanina used to take the money and return it. Once, he saw a man lingering around after giving the money (to get it back).</p>
<p class="bas indent2"><span class="nm">8.</span><span class="cl">R. Chanina:</span> I see that you did not intend to give it. You acted wrongly;</p>
<p class="bas indent3"><span class="nm">i.</span>Your son is not redeemed! (I.e. some explain 'if I would return your money, your son would not be redeemed.')</p>
<p class="bas subject"><span class="nm">4)</span>ACHARAYUS FOR PIDYON</p>
<p class="bas indent1"><span class="nm">(a)</span><span class="cl">(Mishnah):</span> If Reuven separated money for Pidyon ha'Ben and it was lost, he has Acharayus.</p>
<p class="bas indent1"><span class="nm">(b)</span><span class="cl">Question:</span> What is the source of this?</p>
<p class="bas indent1"><span class="nm">(c)</span><span class="cl">Answer #1 (Reish Lakish):</span> We learn from a Gezerah Shavah "Erech-Erech" from Erchin. (Just like there is Acharayus for Erchin, also for Pidyon ha'Ben.)</p>
<p class="bas indent1"><span class="nm">(d)</span><span class="cl">Answer #2 (R. Yochanan):</span> It says "v'Chol Bechor Banecha Tifdeh v'Lo Yera'u Fanai Reikam." We learn from a Gezerah Shavah "Reikam-Reikam" from Olas Re'iyah (that one must bring on each Regel). Just like there is Acharayus for Olas Re'iyah, also for Pidyon ha'Ben.</p>
<p class="bas indent1"><span class="nm">(e)</span><span class="cl">Objection (to both of them - Rav Papa):</span> The Mishnah itself gives a (different) source!</p>
<p class="bas indent1"><span class="nm">(f)</span><span class="cl">Answer #3 (Rav Papa):</span> We learn from "Yihyeh Lach Ach Pado Sifdeh" (like the Mishnah says);</p>
<p class="bas indent2"><span class="nm">1.</span>Reish Lakish (and R. Yochanan) explained a previous Mishnah (49a).</p>
<p class="bas indent2"><span class="nm">2.</span><span class="cl">(Mishnah):</span> If a Peter Rechem died after 30 days, even if his father had not yet given five Shekalim, he must give now.</p>
<p class="bas indent2"><span class="nm">3.</span><span class="cl">Question:</span> What is the source of this?</p>
<p class="bas indent2"><span class="nm">4.</span><span class="cl">Answer #1 (Reish Lakish):</span> We learn "Erech-Erech" from Erchin. (Even if the Ne'erach died, the Ma'arich must pay. Likewise, once the father was obligated, death of the son does not exempt him.)</p>
<p class="bas indent2"><span class="nm">5.</span><span class="cl">Answer #2 (R. Yochanan):</span> We learn "Reikam-Reikam" from Olas Re'iyah. Just like there is Acharayus for obligatory Olos, also for Pidyon ha'Ben.</p>
<p class="bas subject"><span class="nm">5)</span>FROM WHAT DOES A <i>BECHOR</i> RECEIVE A DOUBLE PORTION?</p>
<p class="bas indent1"><span class="nm">(a)</span><span class="cl">(Mishnah):</span> A Bechor receives a double portion of his father's property, but not of his mother's;</p>
<p class="bas indent1"><span class="nm">(b)</span>(If the value of his father's property increased after death and before dividing the estate), the Bechor does not receive a double portion of the Shevach (increased value);</p>
<p class="bas indent2"><span class="nm">1.</span>The double portion applies only to what was Muchzak (owned at the time of death) to his father, but not to what was only Ra'uy (destined to come to him, e.g. a debt or inheritance).</p>
