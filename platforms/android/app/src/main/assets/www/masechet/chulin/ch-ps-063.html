<div class="subject"><span class="nm">1)</span><p>THE SPECIES THE TORAH FORBIDS</p></div>
<div class="indent1"><span class="nm">(a)</span><p><span class="cl">(Rav Yehudah):</span> "Sholach" is the bird that takes fish from the sea (seagull). "Duchifas" (hoopoe) has a thick comb.</p></div>
<div class="indent1"><span class="nm">(b)</span><p><span class="cl">Support (Beraisa):</span> Duchifas has a thick comb. This bird brought the Shamir (the special worm used to cut stones for the Mikdash).</p></div>
<div class="indent1"><span class="nm">(c)</span><p><span class="cl">(R. Yochanan):</span> The Sholach exemplifies "Your (Hash-m's) judgments are utterly deep." (It takes a fish from the sea when the fish is destined to die. Alternatively, Hash-m decreed that the Sholach must toil so hard for its food);</p></div>
<div class="indent2"><span class="nm">1.</span><p>The ant exemplifies "Tzidkascha k'Harerei Kel". (Even a tiny creature has life energy like a big creature. Alternatively, an ant finds its food easily.)</p></div>
<div class="indent1"><span class="nm">(d)</span><p><span class="cl">(Ameimar):</span> Likni and Bitni are permitted;</p></div>
<div class="indent2"><span class="nm">1.</span><p>One must follow the local custom regarding Shaknoy and Bitnoy. It varies from place to place.</p></div>
<div class="indent2"><span class="nm">2.</span><p><span class="cl">Question:</span> Why should the law depend on custom?</p></div>
<div class="indent2"><span class="nm">3.</span><p><span class="cl">Answer:</span> Theses are similar to Peres and Ozniyah. Where Peres and Ozniyah are common, we are concerned lest the species be confused, so one may not eat (what he thinks) is Shaknoy and Bitnoy.</p></div>
<div class="indent1"><span class="nm">(e)</span><p><span class="cl">(Abaye):</span> Kavoy and Kakavoy are forbidden. Kakuasa is permitted.</p></div>
<div class="indent2"><span class="nm">1.</span><p>Chachamim in Eretz Yisrael lash one who eats Kakuasa. They call it Tachvasa.</p></div>
<div class="indent1"><span class="nm">(f)</span><p><span class="cl">(Beraisa):</span> Tinshemes (a kind of bat) is the Bavas (night crier; some explain, the most despised) of the birds.</p></div>
<div class="indent2"><span class="nm">1.</span><p><span class="cl">Suggestion:</span> Perhaps it is rather the Bavas of the Sheratzim (rodents)!</p></div>
<div class="indent2"><span class="nm">2.</span><p><span class="cl">Rejection:</span> One of the 13 methods of expounding the Torah is to learn from the context. Tinshemes is in the Parsha of birds, it is a bird.</p></div>
<div class="indent1"><span class="nm">(g)</span><p><span class="cl">(Beraisa):</span> Tinshemes (mole) is the Bavas of the Sheratzim.</p></div>
<div class="indent2"><span class="nm">1.</span><p><span class="cl">Suggestion:</span> Perhaps it is rather the Bavas of the birds!</p></div>
<div class="indent2"><span class="nm">2.</span><p><span class="cl">Rejection:</span> We learn from the context. Tinshemes (mentioned) in the Parsha of Sheratzim is a Sheretz.</p></div>
<div class="indent1"><span class="nm">(h)</span><p><span class="cl">(Abaye):</span> Kifuf is the Bavas of the birds. Korpedai is the Bavas of the Sheratzim.</p></div>
<div class="indent1"><span class="nm">(i)</span><p><span class="cl">(Rav Yehudah):</span> "Ko'as" is the Kuk. "Rocham" is Sherakrak.</p></div>
<div class="indent2"><span class="nm">1.</span><p><span class="cl">(R. Yochanan):</span> It is called Rocham because Rachamim (mercy, i.e. rain) comes after it appears.</p></div>
<div class="indent2"><span class="nm">2.</span><p><span class="cl">(Rav Bivi bar Abaye):</span> This is only if it was perched on something and chirping.</p></div>
<div class="indent2"><span class="nm">3.</span><p>We have a tradition that if it would sit on the ground and chirp, Mashi'ach would come.</p></div>
<div class="indent2"><span class="nm">4.</span><p><span class="cl">Question (Rav Ada bar Simi):</span> Such a bird chirped on the ground, and a stone fell on it and killed it!</p></div>
<div class="indent2"><span class="nm">5.</span><p><span class="cl">Answer (Mar bar Rav Idai):</span> That bird lied (and was duly punished).</p></div>
<div class="indent1"><span class="nm">(j)</span><p><span class="cl">(Beraisa):</span> "Orev" is an Orev (raven). "Kol Orev" includes the Amaki (deep) raven. "L'Mino" includes the raven b'Roshei Yonim (this will be explained.)</p></div>
<div class="indent1"><span class="nm">(k)</span><p><span class="cl">Question:</span> Saying 'this is an Orev' does not clarify anything!</p></div>
<div class="indent1"><span class="nm">(l)</span><p><span class="cl">Correction:</span> Rather, "Orev" is a black raven, like we learn from "black, like a raven";</p></div>
<div class="indent2"><span class="nm">1.</span><p>An Amaki (deep) raven is white. Tzara'as is white; it is "deeper than the skin";</p></div>
<div class="indent1"><span class="nm">(m)</span><p><span class="cl">(Rav Papa):</span> 'The raven b'Roshei Yonim' means that its head looks like a dove's head.</p></div>
<div class="indent1"><span class="nm">(n)</span><p><span class="cl">(Beraisa):</span> "The Netz" is a Netz (hawk). "L'Minehu" includes Bar Chiri.</p></div>
<div class="indent1"><span class="nm">(o)</span><p><span class="cl">Question:</span> What is Bar Chiri?</p></div>
<div class="indent1"><span class="nm">(p)</span><p><span class="cl">Answer (Abaye):</span> It is Shorinka (a hawk).</p></div>
<div class="indent1"><span class="nm">(q)</span><p><span class="cl">(Rav Yehudah):</span> "Ha'Chasidah" is a white Dayah.</p></div>
<div class="indent2"><span class="nm">1.</span><p>It is called Chasidah because it does Chesed with its friends.</p></div>
<div class="indent1"><span class="nm">(r)</span><p>"Ha'Anafah" is an ill-tempered Dayah.</p></div>
<div class="indent2"><span class="nm">1.</span><p>It is called Anafah because it is Mis'anef (gets angry) with its friends.</p></div>
<div class="subject"><span class="nm">2)</span><p>THE 24 TAMEI BIRDS</p></div>
<div class="indent1"><span class="nm">(a)</span><p><span class="cl">(Rav Chanan bar Rav Chisda citing Rav Chisda):</span> There are 24 Tamei birds.</p></div>
<div class="indent1"><span class="nm">(b)</span><p><span class="cl">Question (Rav Chanan bar Rav Chisda):</span> The Torah lists the Tamei birds twice. It does not list 24 either time!</p></div>
<div class="indent2"><span class="nm">1.</span><p>In Vayikra, it lists 20. In Devarim, it lists 21!</p></div>
<div class="indent2"><span class="nm">2.</span><p><span class="cl">Suggestion:</span> "Do'oh" is listed in Vayikra, but not in Devarim. We should add this to the list in Devarim.</p></div>
<div class="indent2"><span class="nm">3.</span><p><span class="cl">Rejection:</span> Still, we will have only 22!</p></div>
<div class="indent1"><span class="nm">(c)</span><p><span class="cl">Answer (Rav Chisda):</span> Regarding four species, the Torah says "and its related species." Each of these adds another species.</p></div>
<div class="indent1"><span class="nm">(d)</span><p><span class="cl">Question:</span> If so, there are 26!</p></div>
<div class="indent1"><span class="nm">(e)</span><p><span class="cl">Answer (Abaye):</span> "Do'oh' and 'Ro'oh' are two names for the same species.</p></div>
<div class="indent2"><span class="nm">1.</span><p><span class="cl">Support:</span> We must say so, for they are repeated in Devarim to add species. It is unreasonable that a species would be omitted!</p></div>
<div class="bbbline">63b----------------------------------------63b</p></div>
<div class="indent2"><span class="nm">2.</span><p>We must say that Do'oh is also in Devarim, i.e. it is Ro'oh.</p></div>
<div class="indent1"><span class="nm">(f)</span><p><span class="cl">Question:</span> Still, this leaves 25 species!</p></div>
<div class="indent1"><span class="nm">(g)</span><p><span class="cl">Answer (Abaye):</span> Also, Ayah and Dayah are the same species.</p></div>
<div class="indent2"><span class="nm">1.</span><p>It is unreasonable that the Torah would say "l'Minah" (to include a related species) regarding Ayah in one list, and "l'Minah" regarding Dayah (but not by Ayah) elsewhere, especially since the latter list comes to add species!</p></div>
<div class="indent2"><span class="nm">2.</span><p>Rather, we must say that they are the same species.</p></div>
<div class="indent1"><span class="nm">(h)</span><p><span class="cl">Question:</span> If they are the same, why does the Torah write both?</p></div>
<div class="indent1"><span class="nm">(i)</span><p><span class="cl">Answer (Beraisa - Rebbi):</span> Had the Torah called it by only one name, people who call it by the other name would be able to claim that the Torah did not forbid it.</p></div>
<div class="indent1"><span class="nm">(j)</span><p><span class="cl">Question (Beraisa):</span> The animals with only one Siman of Taharah were repeated in Devarim to teach about the Shesu'ah; the birds were repeated to teach about the Ro'oh.</p></div>
<div class="indent2"><span class="nm">1.</span><p><span class="cl">Suggestion:</span> Just like the animals were repeated to teach about a new one, also the birds were repeated to teach about a new one!</p></div>
<div class="indent2"><span class="nm">2.</span><p><span class="cl">Rejection:</span> No - regarding animals, it adds; regarding birds, it clarifies.</p></div>
<div class="indent1"><span class="nm">(k)</span><p>R. Avahu holds that there are not 24 species.</p></div>
<div class="indent1"><span class="nm">(l)</span><p><span class="cl">(R. Avahu):</span> Ro'oh and Ayah are the same species.</p></div>
<div class="indent2"><span class="nm">1.</span><p>It is called Ro'oh because it sees very far - "The eye of an Ayah did not see it".</p></div>
<div class="indent2"><span class="nm">2.</span><p><span class="cl">(Beraisa):</span> From Bavel it can see a carcass in Eretz Yisrael.</p></div>
<div class="indent2"><span class="nm">3.</span><p><span class="cl">Suggestion:</span> Since he holds that Ro'oh and Ayah are the same species, he must hold that Do'oh is not the same like Ro'oh.</p></div>
<div class="indent2"><span class="nm">4.</span><p><span class="cl">Rejection:</span> The list in Devarim comes to add - it is unreasonable that it would omit species!</p></div>
<div class="indent3"><span class="nm">i.</span><p>Rather, we must say that Do'oh, Ro'oh and Ayah are all the same.</p></div>
<div class="indent2"><span class="nm">5.</span><p><span class="cl">Suggestion:</span> Since he holds that Ro'oh and Ayah are the same species, he must hold that Dayah is not the same like Ayah.</p></div>
<div class="indent2"><span class="nm">6.</span><p><span class="cl">Rejection:</span> It is unreasonable that it says "l'Minah" regarding Ayah in Vayikra, and "l'Minah" regarding Dayah (but not regarding Ayah) in Devarim (in particular, since the latter list comes to add species!)</p></div>
<div class="indent3"><span class="nm">i.</span><p>It must be, they are the same species. (In conclusion, all four are the same species, there are only 23 Tamei species.)</p></div>
<div class="subject"><span class="nm">3)</span><p>THE MULTITUDE OF SPECIES</p></div>
<div class="indent1"><span class="nm">(a)</span><p><span class="cl">(Beraisa - Isi ben Yehudah):</span> There are 100 species of Tamei birds in the east. They are all species of Ayah.</p></div>
<div class="indent1"><span class="nm">(b)</span><p><span class="cl">(Avimi brei d'R. Avahu - Beraisa):</span> There are 700 species of (Tamei) fish, 800 species of (Tamei) Chagavim, and countless birds.</p></div>
<div class="indent1"><span class="nm">(c)</span><p><span class="cl">Question:</span> There are only 24 (Tamei) birds!</p></div>
<div class="indent1"><span class="nm">(d)</span><p><span class="cl">Answer:</span> He teaches that there are countless Tahor birds.</p></div>
<div class="indent1"><span class="nm">(e)</span><p><span class="cl">(Beraisa - Rebbi):</span> Hash-m knows that there are more Tahor birds than Tamei. Therefore, the Torah lists the Teme'im.</p></div>
<div class="indent1"><span class="nm">(f)</span><p><span class="cl">Question:</span> What is the Chidush?</p></div>
<div class="indent1"><span class="nm">(g)</span><p><span class="cl">Answer:</span> He teaches Rav Huna's law;</p></div>
<div class="indent2"><span class="nm">1.</span><p><span class="cl">(Rav Huna):</span> One should teach his Talmidim concisely.</p></div>
<div class="indent1"><span class="nm">(h)</span><p><span class="cl">(R. Yitzchak):</span> One needs a tradition to eat a species of bird. A hunter is believed to say that his teacher told him that a certain species is Tahor.</p></div>
<div class="indent2"><span class="nm">1.</span><p><span class="cl">(R. Yochanan):</span> He (the teacher) must know the names and recognize the Tamei species.</p></div>
<div class="indent2"><span class="nm">2.</span><p><span class="cl">Question (R. Zeira):</span> Does this refer to his Rebbi who taught him Torah, or the one who taught him how to hunt?</p></div>
<div class="indent2"><span class="nm">3.</span><p><span class="cl">Answer:</span> R. Yochanan said that the teacher must know the names and recognize the Tamei species.</p></div>
<div class="indent3"><span class="nm">i.</span><p>This is reasonable regarding the one who taught him how to hunt.</p></div>
<div class="indent3"><span class="nm">ii.</span><p>A Chacham would know the names, but he would not recognize all the Tamei species!</p></div>
<div class="subject"><span class="nm">4)</span><p>BUYING EGGS FROM NOCHRIM</p></div>
<div class="indent1"><span class="nm">(a)</span><p><span class="cl">(Beraisa):</span> In any place, we may buy eggs from Nochrim. We are not concerned lest they came from a Nevelah or Treifah.</p></div>
<div class="indent1"><span class="nm">(b)</span><p><span class="cl">Question:</span> Why aren't we concerned lest they are from a Tamei species?</p></div>
<div class="indent1"><span class="nm">(c)</span><p><span class="cl">Answer (Shmuel's father):</span> The case is, the Nochri said that they are from a particular Tahor species.</p></div>
<div class="indent1"><span class="nm">(d)</span><p><span class="cl">Question:</span> Why must he specify the species?</p></div>
<div class="indent1"><span class="nm">(e)</span><p><span class="cl">Answer:</span> If he would just say that they are Tahor, he could lie without fear of being caught.</p></div>
