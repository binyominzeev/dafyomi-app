<p class="bas subject"><span class="nm">1)</span>WHEN ARE WE CONCERNED FOR <i>NISUCH?</i> (cont.)</p>
<p class="bas indent1"><span class="nm">(a)</span><span class="cl">(Mishnah):</span> If Reuven processed the wine of a Nochri (Tony) (to sell it to Yisraelim) and it was left in Tony's house, which is open to a Reshus ha'Rabim:</p>
<p class="bas indent2"><span class="nm">1.</span>If there are Nochrim and Yisraelim in the city, the wine is permitted;</p>
<p class="bas indent2"><span class="nm">2.</span>If there are only Nochrim in the city, the wine is permitted only if a Yisrael sits and guards it.</p>
<p class="bas indent3"><span class="nm">i.</span>It suffices if the guard goes in and out.</p>
<p class="bas indent2"><span class="nm">3.</span>R. Shimon ben Elazar says, the domain of Nochrim has one law (this will be explained).</p>
<p class="bas indent1"><span class="nm">(b)</span>If Reuven processed Tony's wine and it was left in Tony's house, and Tony wrote 'I already received the money for it (from you)', the wine is permitted;</p>
<p class="bas indent2"><span class="nm">1.</span>A case occurred in Beis She'an in which Tony did not let Reuven take it before paying. Chachamim forbade the wine.</p>
<p class="bas indent1"><span class="nm">(c)</span><span class="cl">(Gemara) Question:</span> Even if the city is all Nochrim, surely Yisrael peddlers (who go from city to city) pass through! (Tony is afraid to be Menasech, lest they see him!)</p>
<p class="bas indent1"><span class="nm">(d)</span><span class="cl">Answer (Shmuel):</span> The case is, the city has a locked gate. (Rashi - the inhabitants know when it was opened for peddlers to enter; R. Chananel - they assume that no peddlers enter; Ra'avad - the city has peddlers who live there. Travelling peddlers do not enter.)</p>
<p class="bas indent1"><span class="nm">(e)</span><span class="cl">(Rav Yosef):</span> If a window (of a Yisrael's house) looks into where the wine is kept, this is like being open to a Reshus ha'Rabim. Also a wasteheap (people can stand on it) or a date tree (of a Yisrael (David)) is like a Reshus ha'Rabim.</p>
<p class="bas indent1"><span class="nm">(f)</span><span class="cl">(Rav Acha or Ravina):</span> If the date tree no longer bears fruit, the wine is forbidden. (Tony does not fear lest David go up the tree);</p>
<p class="bas indent1"><span class="nm">(g)</span><span class="cl">(The other of Rav Acha and Ravina):</span> Even if it no longer bears fruit, the wine is permitted. (Tony fears lest David go up to look for lost animals.)</p>
<p class="bas indent1"><span class="nm">(h)</span><span class="cl">(Beraisa - R. Meir):</span> If Shimon bought or rented a house in Tony's Chatzer and filled it with wine (Shimon does not live there):</p>
<p class="bas indent2"><span class="nm">1.</span>If a Yisrael lives in the Chatzer, the wine is permitted, even if Shimon does not have a lock and seal on the wine;</p>
<p class="bas bbbline">61b----------------------------------------61b</p>
<p class="bas indent2"><span class="nm">2.</span>If a Yisrael lives in a nearby Chatzer, the wine is permitted only if Shimon has a lock and seal on it.</p>
<p class="bas indent2"><span class="nm">3.</span>If Reuven processed Tony's wine and it was left in Tony's house, and a Yisrael lives in that Chatzer, the wine is permitted only if Reuven has a lock and seal on it;</p>
<p class="bas indent3"><span class="nm">i.</span><span class="cl">R. Yochanan:</span> This clause should say 'even if Reuven does <i>not</i> have a lock and seal on it.'</p>
<p class="bas indent2"><span class="nm">4.</span>If a Yisrael lives in a nearby Chatzer, the wine is forbidden even if he has a lock and seal on it;</p>
<p class="bas indent2"><span class="nm">5.</span>Chachamim say, it is forbidden unless a Yisrael guards it, or someone comes at fixed times to see.</p>
<p class="bas indent1"><span class="nm">(i)</span><span class="cl">Question:</span> Which law do Chachamim dispute?</p>
<p class="bas indent1"><span class="nm">(j)</span><span class="cl">Answer #1:</span> They dispute the last law. (Reuven processed Tony's wine, it was left in Tony's house, and a Yisrael lives in a nearby Chatzer.)</p>
<p class="bas indent1"><span class="nm">(k)</span><span class="cl">Rejection:</span> Also the first Tana forbids!</p>
<p class="bas indent1"><span class="nm">(l)</span><span class="cl">Answer #2:</span> They dispute the law before this. (Reuven processed Tony's wine, it was in Tony's house, and a Yisrael lives in that Chatzer.)</p>
<p class="bas indent1"><span class="nm">(m)</span><span class="cl">Rejection:</span> R. Yochanan emended the text to say 'even if Reuven does <i>not</i> have a lock and seal on it.' Surely, we are lenient in this case!</p>
<p class="bas indent1"><span class="nm">(n)</span><span class="cl">Answer #3:</span> They dispute the second law. (Shimon bought or rented a house in Tony's Chatzer and filled it with wine, and a Yisrael lives in a nearby Chatzer.)</p>
<p class="bas indent2"><span class="nm">1.</span>The first Tana permits the wine if Shimon has a lock and seal on it;</p>
<p class="bas indent2"><span class="nm">2.</span>Chachamim require a guard or one who comes at fixed times to see.</p>
<p class="bas indent2"><span class="nm">3.</span><span class="cl">Objection:</span> Coming at fixed times is worse! (Tony is unafraid at other times.)</p>
<p class="bas indent2"><span class="nm">4.</span><span class="cl">Correction:</span> Rather, someone comes at unpredictable times.</p>
<p class="bas subject"><span class="nm">2)</span>R. SHIMON BEN ELAZAR'S OPINION</p>
<p class="bas indent1"><span class="nm">(a)</span><span class="cl">(Mishnah - R. Shimon ben Elazar):</span> The domain of Nochrim has one law.</p>
<p class="bas indent1"><span class="nm">(b)</span><span class="cl">Question:</span> Is he more lenient or more stringent than Chachamim (the first Tana)?</p>
<p class="bas indent1"><span class="nm">(c)</span><span class="cl">Answer #1 (Rav Yehudah):</span> He is more lenient;</p>
<p class="bas indent2"><span class="nm">1.</span>Chachamim say, even if the wine is stored with a second Nochri (Ricky), it is forbidden (unless there are Yisraelim in the city or a guard);</p>
<p class="bas indent3"><span class="nm">i.</span>We are concerned for Gomelin. (Even though Ricky would not touch it (it is not his at all), he would let Tony touch it, for Tony would let Ricky do the same if a Yisrael processed Ricky's wine and it were with Tony.)</p>
<p class="bas indent2"><span class="nm">2.</span>R. Shimon ben Elazar asks in astonishment, do the domains of all Nochrim have the same law?! (Rather, we are concerned only if the wine is with its owner.)</p>
<p class="bas indent1"><span class="nm">(d)</span><span class="cl">Answer #2 (Rav Nachman):</span> He is more stringent;</p>
<p class="bas indent2"><span class="nm">1.</span>Chachamim are concerned only if the wine is with its owner;</p>
<p class="bas indent2"><span class="nm">2.</span>R. Shimon ben Elazar says, the domains of all Nochrim have the same law. (We are concerned for Gomelin.)</p>
<p class="bas indent1"><span class="nm">(e)</span><span class="cl">Support (for Rav Nachman - Beraisa - R. Shimon ben Elazar):</span> The domains of all Nochrim have the same law, because they cover up for each other.</p>
<p class="bas indent1"><span class="nm">(f)</span>Porzak (a Nochri) was second to the king. His household kept wine with their sharecropper.</p>
<p class="bas indent1"><span class="nm">(g)</span><span class="cl">Rabanan:</span> Since the sharecropper would not keep wine with Porzak, all agree that we are not concerned for Gomelin.</p>
<p class="bas indent1"><span class="nm">(h)</span><span class="cl">Rava:</span> Just the contrary! Since the sharecropper fears Porzak, Porzak might touch the wine. He knows that the sharecropper is afraid to tell.</p>
<p class="bas indent1"><span class="nm">(i)</span>Reuven had wine in a big city. A Nochri was found between the barrels.</p>
<p class="bas indent1"><span class="nm">(j)</span><span class="cl">Rava:</span> If the Nochri (fears the authorities and) has no right to touch it (Rashi; Tosfos - to be there), the wine is permitted. (He is afraid. He would not do anything).</p>
