<div class="subject"><span class="nm">1)</span><p>HOW THE MEAT WAS HUCHSHAR</p></div>
<div class="indent1"><span class="nm">(a)</span><p><span class="cl">(Mishnah):</span> The meat is Tamei.</p></div>
<div class="indent1"><span class="nm">(b)</span><p><span class="cl">Question:</span> How was the meat Huchshar?</p></div>
<div class="indent1"><span class="nm">(c)</span><p><span class="cl">Answer #1:</span> It was Huchshar through blood [during slaughter].</p></div>
<div class="indent1"><span class="nm">(d)</span><p><span class="cl">Rejection:</span> R. Chiya bar Aba taught that blood of Kodshim is not Machshir - we learn from "Al ha'Aretz Tishpechenu ka'Mayim" - only blood which is spilled like water is Machshir, but not blood of Kodshim!</p></div>
<div class="indent1"><span class="nm">(e)</span><p><span class="cl">Answer #2:</span> It was Huchshar through liquids of Beis Mitbechai.</p></div>
<div class="indent1"><span class="nm">(f)</span><p><span class="cl">Rejection:</span> R. Yosi b'Ribi Chanina taught, not only are liquids of Beis Mitbechai Tehorim - they are not even Machshir!</p></div>
<div class="indent1"><span class="nm">(g)</span><p><span class="cl">Answer #3:</span> It was Huchshar through Chibas ha'Kodesh (the dearness of Kodshim esteems it as if it was Huchshar).</p></div>
<div class="indent1"><span class="nm">(h)</span><p><span class="cl">Question:</span> Granted, Chibas ha'Kodesh is Machshir to enable it to become Nifsal - does it enable to make a Sheni? (The Mishnah says that the meat is <i>Tamei</i>, not just Pasul.)</p></div>
<div class="indent2"><span class="nm">1.</span><p><span class="cl">Suggestion:</span> We can resolve Reish Lakish's question!</p></div>
<div class="indent2"><span class="nm">2.</span><p><span class="cl">Question (Reish Lakish):</span> If a dry Minchah (Aruch - a flour-offering without oil; Rashi - the part of a Minchah which did not touch oil) became Tamei, does it make a Sheni (can it Metamei other foods? It was not Huchshar through a liquid, only through Chibas ha'Kodesh.)</p></div>
<div class="indent1"><span class="nm">(i)</span><p><span class="cl">Rejection (Rav Yehudah):</span> No - [the meat was not Huchshar through Chibas ha'Kodesh, rather,] the animal was taken through a river (Rashi - to facilitate flaying; Rambam - to clear the lungs of scabs that can make it appear Tereifah), it was still wet after slaughter. (Rashi - surely, some water fell on the meat; Tosfos - the meat is Huchshar through the skin.)</p></div>
<div class="indent1"><span class="nm">(j)</span><p><span class="cl">(Mishnah):</span> If it was found in the Peresh (excrement), everything is Tahor.</p></div>
<div class="indent1"><span class="nm">(k)</span><p><span class="cl">Question:</span> The Peresh should Metamei the meat!</p></div>
<div class="indent1"><span class="nm">(l)</span><p><span class="cl">Answer #1 (Rav Ada bar Ahavah):</span> The case is, the Peresh is thick (it is considered a food), therefore it cannot Metamei another food. (It itself is Tamei - 'everything is Tahor' refers only to the knife, hands and meat.)</p></div>
<div class="indent1"><span class="nm">(m)</span><p><span class="cl">Answer #2 (Rav Ashi):</span> Since Peresh is putrid, it can even be fluid (it is not Mekabel Tum'ah at all).</p></div>
<div class="subject"><span class="nm">2)</span><p>A SHERETZ IS METAMEI THREE DEGREES</p></div>
<div class="indent1"><span class="nm">(a)</span><p><span class="cl">(A reciter of Beraisos):</span> A Sheretz is Metamei liquids, the liquids are Metamei Kelim, Kelim Metamei food, and food is Metamei liquids - we learn three [levels of] Tum'ah from a Sheretz.</p></div>
<div class="indent1"><span class="nm">(b)</span><p><span class="cl">Question:</span> It lists four Tum'os!</p></div>
<div class="indent1"><span class="nm">(c)</span><p><span class="cl">Answer:</span> We must delete the first time it mentions liquids.</p></div>
<div class="indent1"><span class="nm">(d)</span><p><span class="cl">Question:</span> Why not delete the second mention of liquids?</p></div>
<div class="indent1"><span class="nm">(e)</span><p><span class="cl">Answer:</span> The only Tana who said that liquids Metamei Kelim is R. Yehudah, and he retracted!</p></div>
<div class="indent1"><span class="nm">(f)</span><p>A way to remember this is the way beer is brewed (one brings a Keli, then barley (food), then the liquid).</p></div>
<div class="indent1"><span class="nm">(g)</span><p><span class="cl">(Mishnah):</span> If a Sheretz was found in a [Cheres] oven, the bread inside is a Sheni, for the oven is a Rishon.</p></div>
<div class="indent1"><span class="nm">(h)</span><p><span class="cl">Question (Rav Ada):</span> [Since a Sheretz is Metamei the interior of an oven even if it did not touch the walls,] we should view the entire oven as if it was full of Tum'ah, and the loaf should be a Rishon!</p></div>
<div class="indent1"><span class="nm">(i)</span><p><span class="cl">Answer (Rava):</span> We do not view it like this [for if we did, Kelim inside would become Tamei]:</p></div>
<div class="indent2"><span class="nm">1.</span><p><span class="cl">(Beraisa) Suggestion:</span> Perhaps all Kelim are Mekabel Tum'ah from the airspace of a Kli Cheres!</p></div>
<div class="bbbline">20b----------------------------------------20b</p></div>
<div class="indent2"><span class="nm">2.</span><p><span class="cl">Rejection:</span> "Kol Asher b'Socho Yitma...; Mi'Kol ha'Ochel Asher Ye'achel" - food is Mekabel Tum'ah from the airspace of a Kli Cheres, Kelim are not.</p></div>
<div class="subject"><span class="nm">3)</span><p>MAY WE BURN TALUY AND TAMEI TOGETHER?</p></div>
<div class="indent1"><span class="nm">(a)</span><p><span class="cl">Question (Rav Chisda):</span> In our Mishnah (14A), R. Yehoshua permits burning Taluy and Tamei Terumah [of Chametz] together;</p></div>
<div class="indent2"><span class="nm">1.</span><p><span class="cl">Contradiction (Beraisa - R. Yosi):</span> What you seek to learn is unlike your source! Our teachers (R. Yehoshua and R. Eliezer) testified about burning meat [or oil] that was Nitma [or Nifsal] through a Vlad ha'Tum'ah [or a Tevul Yom] with meat [or oil] that was Nitma through an Av ha'Tum'ah - I agree that we may burn [Chametz] Terumah that was Nitma through a Vlad ha'Tum'ah with Terumah that was Nitma through an Av!</p></div>
<div class="indent2"><span class="nm">2.</span><p>But how can we burn even Taluy Terumah with Tamei - perhaps Eliyahu will come and tell us that it was Tahor!</p></div>
<div class="indent1"><span class="nm">(b)</span><p><span class="cl">Answer (Rav Chisda):</span> R. Shimon says that R. Yehoshua permits burning them together; R. Yosi says that he forbids:</p></div>
<div class="indent2"><span class="nm">1.</span><p><span class="cl">(Beraisa - R. Meir):</span> When the 14th falls on Shabbos (we cannot burn Chametz at the time of Bi'ur), we destroy everything before Shabbos; we burn Terumah, whether it is Tamei, Taluy or Tahor;</p></div>
<div class="indent2"><span class="nm">2.</span><p>R. Yosi says, we burn separately Tamei, Taluy and Tahor Terumah.</p></div>
<div class="indent2"><span class="nm">3.</span><p>R. Shimon says, R. Eliezer and R. Yehoshua agree that we burn Tahor and Tamei separately, and that we may burn Tahor and Taluy together;</p></div>
<div class="indent3"><span class="nm">i.</span><p>They argue about whether or not we may burn Taluy and Tamei together - R. Yehoshua permits, and R. Eliezer forbids.</p></div>
<div class="indent1"><span class="nm">(c)</span><p><span class="cl">Question:</span> In our Mishnah (14A), R. Yosi said that R. Yehoshua permits burning Taluy and Tamei together!</p></div>
<div class="indent1"><span class="nm">(d)</span><p><span class="cl">Answer:</span> R. Yosi told R. Meir that even the lenient opinion, R. Yehoshua according to R. Shimon, permits only Taluy and Tamei together, but not Tahor and Tamei.</p></div>
<div class="indent1"><span class="nm">(e)</span><p><span class="cl">Question (R. Yosi b'Rebbi Chanina):</span> In our Mishnah (14A), R. Yehoshua permits burning Taluy and Tamei Terumah [of Chametz] together;</p></div>
<div class="indent2"><span class="nm">1.</span><p><span class="cl">Contradiction (Mishnah #1 - R. Eliezer):</span> If a barrel of Terumah is Safek Tamei:</p></div>
<div class="indent3"><span class="nm">i.</span><p>If it was in an open place (it is prone to become Vadai Tamei), we put it in a hidden place; if it was exposed, we cover it;</p></div>
<div class="indent2"><span class="nm">2.</span><p>R. Yehoshua says, if it was in a hidden place, we put it in an open place; if it was covered, we [may] expose it (alternatively, one should do so, so it will become Vadai Tamei and thus usable).</p></div>
<div class="indent2"><span class="nm">3.</span><p>R. Yehoshua permits only Gerama (causation) - he does not permit to overtly Metamei [what is Taluy]!</p></div>
<div class="indent1"><span class="nm">(f)</span><p><span class="cl">Answer (R. Yosi b'Rebbi Chanina):</span> R. Shimon says that R. Yehoshua permits burning them together; R. Yosi says that he forbids.</p></div>
<div class="indent1"><span class="nm">(g)</span><p><span class="cl">Question (R. Elazar):</span> In Mishnah #1, R. Yehoshua permits only Gerama - he does not permit to overtly Metamei [Taluy];</p></div>
<div class="indent2"><span class="nm">1.</span><p><span class="cl">Contradiction (Mishnah #2):</span> If a barrel of Terumah wine broke in the upper winepress and it is about to fall into Tamei Chulin below, R. Eliezer and R. Yehoshua agree that if one can save a Revi'is in Taharah, he must do so;</p></div>
<div class="indent2"><span class="nm">2.</span><p>If he cannot - R. Eliezer says, he must allow the Terumah to fall, he may not actively Metamei it;</p></div>
<div class="indent2"><span class="nm">3.</span><p>R. Yehoshua says, he may actively Metamei the Terumah.</p></div>
<div class="indent1"><span class="nm">(h)</span><p><span class="cl">Answer (R. Elazar):</span> R. Yehoshua permits in order to avoid a loss of Chulin.</p></div>
<div class="indent1"><span class="nm">(i)</span><p><span class="cl">Question (Rava):</span> Also in our Mishnah, R. Yehoshua requires burning separately even though this entails a loss, i.e. extra wood is required!</p></div>
<div class="indent1"><span class="nm">(j)</span><p><span class="cl">Answer (Abaye):</span> Chachamim were concerned for a large loss, but not for a small loss.</p></div>
<div class="subject"><span class="nm">4)</span><p>WE ARE CONCERNED FOR A SMALL LOSS?</p></div>
<div class="indent1"><span class="nm">(a)</span><p><span class="cl">Question:</span> What is the source that Chachamim were concerned for a large loss, but not for a small loss?</p></div>
<div class="indent1"><span class="nm">(b)</span><p><span class="cl">Answer (Beraisa):</span> If a barrel of Terumah <i>oil</i> broke in the upper olivepress and it is about to fall into Tamei Chulin below, R. Eliezer and R. Yehoshua agree that if one can save a Revi'is in Taharah, he must do so; and if he cannot, he must allow the Terumah to fall, he may not actively Metamei it.</p></div>
<div class="indent2"><span class="nm">1.</span><p><span class="cl">Question:</span> Presumably, R. Yehoshua forbids regarding oil, for even Tamei Terumah oil may be burned (it is not a total loss) - likewise, Tamei Terumah wine may be used for Ziluf (sprinkling to scent the house)!</p></div>
<div class="indent3"><span class="nm">i.</span><p><span class="cl">Suggestion:</span> Perhaps Ziluf is not an important usage!</p></div>
<div class="indent3"><span class="nm">ii.</span><p><span class="cl">Rejection:</span> Shmuel said that it is appropriate to spend one Sela for a Log of wine for drinking, and two Sela'im for a Log for Ziluf!</p></div>
<div class="indent2"><span class="nm">2.</span><p><span class="cl">Answer:</span> R. Yehoshua permits to Metamei new wine, for [this would be a big loss - it has no scent,] it is not fitting for Ziluf.</p></div>
<div class="indent2"><span class="nm">3.</span><p><span class="cl">Question:</span> He may let it age (it will be fitting later)!</p></div>
<div class="indent2"><span class="nm">4.</span><p><span class="cl">Answer:</span> We are concerned for Takalah, lest someone drink it while it is aging.</p></div>
<div class="indent2"><span class="nm">5.</span><p><span class="cl">Question:</span> If so, we should likewise be concerned lest someone consume Tamei Terumah oil!</p></div>
<div class="indent2"><span class="nm">6.</span><p><span class="cl">Answer:</span> He puts the oil in a disgusting Keli (no one will want to consume it).</p></div>
<div class="indent2"><span class="nm">7.</span><p><span class="cl">Question:</span> Also wine can be put in a disgusting Keli!</p></div>
<div class="indent2"><span class="nm">8.</span><p><span class="cl">Answer:</span> If so, it would not be fit for Ziluf.</p></div>
<div class="indent1"><span class="nm">(c)</span><p>Tana'im argue about whether or not we are concerned for Takalah (Beis Shamai (Rashi - and Beis Hillel) are not concerned; R. Yishmael (Tosfos - and Beis Hillel) are concerned)::</p></div>
<div class="indent2"><span class="nm">1.</span><p><span class="cl">(Beraisa - Beis Shamai):</span> If a barrel of Terumah wine became Tamei, we spill it all out;</p></div>
<div class="indent2"><span class="nm">2.</span><p>Beis Hillel say, it may be used for Ziluf.</p></div>
<div class="indent2"><span class="nm">3.</span><p><span class="cl">Version #1 - R. Yishmael b'Rebbi Yosi:</span> I will Machri'a (give an intermediate opinion) - if it became Tamei in the field, he spills it out [since he would not do Ziluf immediately there, we are concerned for Takalah]; if it was in the house, he may do Ziluf;</p></div>
<div class="indent2"><span class="nm">4.</span><p><span class="cl">Version #2 - R. Yishmael b'Rebbi Yosi:</span> I will Machri'a - new wine must be spilled out; old may be used for Ziluf. (end of Version #2)</p></div>
