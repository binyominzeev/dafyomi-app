<p class="bas subject"><span class="nm">1)</span>RIPS WHICH MAY NEVER BE SEWN</p>
<p class="bas indent1"><span class="nm">(a)</span>A Beraisa lists the various types of rip that may never be resewn:</p>
<p class="bas indent2"><span class="nm">1.</span>A rip made over a parent</p>
<p class="bas indent2"><span class="nm">2.</span>Over one's rabbi, a Nasi, or an Av Beis Din</p>
<p class="bas indent2"><span class="nm">3.</span>Over hearing bad news</p>
<p class="bas indent2"><span class="nm">4.</span>Over hearing blasphemy</p>
<p class="bas indent2"><span class="nm">5.</span>Over seeing a Sefer Torah destroyed</p>
<p class="bas indent2"><span class="nm">6.</span>Over seeing the cities of Judah, the Temple, and Jerusalem in destruction.</p>
<p class="bas indent2"><span class="nm">7.</span>The Beraisa describes the procedure for Keri'ah over the above mentioned holy places: First one does Keri'ah when seeing the Temple in destruction, and then adds to the rip when he sees Jerusalem.</p>
<p class="bas indent1"><span class="nm">(b)</span>The Gemara brings proofs for the above cases - that they require Keri'ah and that the rip may not be sewn.</p>
<p class="bas indent1"><span class="nm">(c)</span>The Gemara notes that case 1:a:3 (bad news) only applies when the bad news is about a majority of the Jewish people.</p>
<p class="bas indent1"><span class="nm">(d)</span>Concerning 1:a:4 the Gemara brings a Beraisa that states: The one who hears the blasphemy (hearer #1) does Keri'ah, and so does someone who hears the report from the one who heard (hearer #2). But when hearer #1 repeats the blasphemy before hearer #2 he does not have to do Keri'ah again. This is derived by the Gemara from a Pasuk.</p>
<p class="bas indent1"><span class="nm">(e)</span>The Gemara discusses the story of Yehoyakim burning the scroll (namely, Eichah) written by Yirmiyahu, described in Yirmiyahu 36.</p>
<p class="bas indent1"><span class="nm">(f)</span>Two details concerning 1:a:5 (Sefer Torah destroyed):</p>
<p class="bas indent2"><span class="nm">1.</span>R. Huna said that two Keri'os are required - one for the Sefer Torah per se and one for its content.</p>
<p class="bas indent2"><span class="nm">2.</span>Keri'ah is only necessary if one could have stopped the destruction of the Sefer Torah but was prevented from doing so. But if it happens suddenly, by an accident (e.g., it is snatched by an animal), Keri'ah is not done.</p>
<p class="bas indent1"><span class="nm">(g)</span>Concerning 1:a:6 (the cities of Judah, etc.), the Gemara brings Pesukim that should be said while doing Keri'ah for these three holy places.</p>
<p class="bas indent1"><span class="nm">(h)</span>The Gemara discusses 1:a:7:</p>
<p class="bas indent2"><span class="nm">1.</span><span class="cl">Question:</span> Another Beraisa states that two separate rips are made for Jerusalem and for the Temple. This contradicts the above Beraisa that says that the rip is made for the Temple and then the same rip is widened for Jerusalem.</p>
<p class="bas indent2"><span class="nm">2.</span><span class="cl">Answer:</span> The first Beraisa (1:a:7) is talking about someone who encounters the Temple Mount before seeing Jerusalem. The second Beraisa is talking about someone who saw Jerusalem first and then the Temple Mount.</p>
<p class="bas subject"><span class="nm">2)</span>DETAILS ABOUT RESEWING</p>
<p class="bas indent1"><span class="nm">(a)</span><span class="cl">(Beraisa):</span> All these rips (1:a:1-6) may be basted; folded together and loosely stitched (Rashi <b>MS</b>.); gathered together and loosely stitched without folding one side over the other (ibid.); or loosely stitched without joining the two pieces close together. The only thing you can't do is sew them properly.</p>
<p class="bas indent2"><span class="nm">1.</span>R. Chisda explains what "sewing properly" means - Alexandrian stitching.</p>
<p class="bas bbbline">26b----------------------------------------26b</p>
<p class="bas indent1"><span class="nm">(b)</span>Another Beraisa states that if a Keri'ah is done not on the material itself, but along one of the aforementioned types of stitching it is not valid. Along a proper stitch it is valid.</p>
<p class="bas indent2"><span class="nm">1.</span>Once again R. Chisda explained that "a proper stitch" means an Alexandrian stitch.</p>
<p class="bas indent1"><span class="nm">(c)</span>The Tana Kama says that if the garment is altered so that it is to be worn upside down, the stitch (which is now towards the bottom of the garment) may be resewn. R. Shimon ben Elazar, however, forbids this.</p>
<p class="bas indent1"><span class="nm">(d)</span>The Beraisa also says that even if a second person buys the garment with the rip (that was done for one of the reasons mentioned above in 1:a:1-6) he may also not sew it.</p>
<p class="bas subject"><span class="nm">3)</span>MULTIPLE <i>KERI'OS</i></p>
<p class="bas indent1"><span class="nm">(a)</span>A Beraisa lists three opinions:</p>
<p class="bas indent2"><span class="nm">1.</span><span class="cl">(R. Meir):</span> The first Keri'ah must be a tefach. If a new rip has to be added to the first one (over an additional calamity) it need be only  three fingerbreadths.</p>
<p class="bas indent2"><span class="nm">2.</span><span class="cl">(R. Yehudah):</span> The first Keri'ah must be three fingerbreadths, and the addition can be any slight amount.</p>
<p class="bas indent2"><span class="nm">3.</span><span class="cl">(R. Yosi):</span> The first Keri'ah must be a tefach, but the addition need be only a slight amount. (Ula ruled like this.)</p>
<p class="bas indent1"><span class="nm">(b)</span>A Beraisa is quoted that makes several points:</p>
<p class="bas indent2"><span class="nm">1.</span>If a Keri'ah was made originally for a parent and then extended for another relative, the top (first) part may not be sewn and the other (second), additional part may be. If vice versa (the top Keri'ah was for another relative and the bottom for the parent) the bottom part may not be sewn but the top may.</p>
<p class="bas indent2"><span class="nm">2.</span>If someone heard about the death of both parents and other relatives at one time there is a dispute. The Tana Kama says one Keri'ah covers all, and R. Yehudah Ben Beseira that the two parents' Keri'ah can be covered by one rip, but the others cannot be mixed in with the parents' rip.</p>
<p class="bas indent1"><span class="nm">(c)</span>Shmuel ruled like R. Yehudah Ben Beseira. Although he is not the most lenient opinion, the rule about following the lenient opinion in matters of mourning does not apply to the laws of Keri'ah.</p>
<p class="bas indent1"><span class="nm">(d)</span>The Gemara brings a Beraisa, which discusses two points:</p>
<p class="bas indent2"><span class="nm">1.</span>How far may a multiple rip extend? One opinion says until the navel, another says until the heart. After that point a new rip must be made, in a different part of the garment.</p>
<p class="bas indent2"><span class="nm">2.</span>Keri'ah done from the bottom of the garment is not valid. The Kohen Gadol, however <i>must</i> do Keri'ah from the bottom.</p>
<p class="bas indent1"><span class="nm">(e)</span>There is a dispute as to when an existing rip may be extended:</p>
<p class="bas indent2"><span class="nm">1.</span>One opinion says that if the second cause for Keri'ah arises during Shiv'ah a new rip must be made, but during Shloshim the old one may be extended. The other opinion says that during Shloshim a new rip must be made; only after Shloshim may the old one be extended.</p>
<p class="bas indent2"><span class="nm">2.</span>The reason the first opinion requires a new rip during Shiv'ah is because during that time the (first) rip may not be basted (above, 22b, 2:i); it is only after the rip has been basted that a further Keri'ah on that spot is noticeable.</p>
<p class="bas indent2"><span class="nm">3.</span><span class="cl">Question:</span> If so, in the case of a woman, who may baste her rip immediately (above, ibid.), she should be able to extend the rip even during Shiv'ah.</p>
<p class="bas indent2"><span class="nm">4.</span><span class="cl">Answer:</span> The basting in that case is not a halachic basting, but is only for the sake of modesty. This kind of basting is not sufficient for doing Keri'ah on it.</p>
<p class="bas indent2"><span class="nm">5.</span>The reason the second opinion requires a new rip during Shiv'ah is because during that time the (first) rip may not be resewn (ibid.); it is only after the rip has been resewn that a further Keri'ah on that spot is noticeable.</p>
<p class="bas indent2"><span class="nm">6.</span><span class="cl">Question:</span> In the case of a parent, where the rip may never be resewn, it should be forbidden to extend a Keri'ah forever.</p>
<p class="bas indent2"><span class="nm">7.</span><span class="cl">Answer:</span> The prohibition to resew in that case is not a halachic prohibition, but is only a gesture of honor of the parent. This kind of prohibition is not sufficient for preventing an extension of an existing rip.</p>
<p class="bas subject"><span class="nm">4)</span>MISCELLANEOUS RULES ABOUT MOURNING</p>
<p class="bas indent1"><span class="nm">(a)</span>A Beraisa is brought that makes two points:</p>
<p class="bas indent2"><span class="nm">1.</span>If someone puts on an already-ripped garment for a dead relative (instead of ripping one anew), it is tantamount to stealing from the deceased (by depriving him of his due) and from the living (by deceiving everyone into thinking that he did Keri'ah).</p>
<p class="bas indent2"><span class="nm">2.</span><span class="cl">(Raban Shimon Ben Gamliel):</span> If one is wearing a borrowed garment when he hears of a death he should not rip it, unless he hinted to the lender that he might have to do Keri'ah on it. In that case he can rip it and then resew it, return it, and pay for the damage.</p>
<p class="bas indent1"><span class="nm">(b)</span>Another Beraisa is brought that makes several points:</p>
<p class="bas indent2"><span class="nm">1.</span>A sick person should not be informed of a relative's death (nor should anyone be allowed to mourn in his presence) if the news may complicate his state of health.</p>
<p class="bas indent2"><span class="nm">2.</span>A child mourner's clothing should be ripped (even though he is too young to participate in mourning), to move other people (who see it) to grief.</p>
<p class="bas indent2"><span class="nm">3.</span>One should do Keri'ah for a parent-in-law, out of respect for his wife.</p>
<p class="bas indent1"><span class="nm">(c)</span>Another Beraisa is brought that says that a mourner should not play with a baby, because it makes him happy and playful, which is inappropriate.</p>
<p class="bas subject"><span class="nm">5)</span>ELABORATION ON <i>MISHNAH'S</i> STATEMENT (24b, 3:b)</p>
<p class="bas indent1"><span class="nm">(a)</span><span class="cl">(Beraisa):</span> When we say that during the mourner's meal the consolers (and mourners too, out of regard for the consolers - Ritva) should sit on overturned beds, this is only if the consoler is very close with the mourner. If he is not very close he (and the mourner) sit on upright beds.</p>
<p class="bas indent1"><span class="nm">(b)</span><span class="cl">Story:</span> Rava became a mourner, and someone came to bring him the mourner's meal. Rava sat on an upright bed (because he did not consider the consoler to be so close with him) but the consoler (inappropriately) sat on an overturned bed.</p>
