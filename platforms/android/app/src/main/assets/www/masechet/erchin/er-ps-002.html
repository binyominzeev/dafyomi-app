<p class="dedicationbox">ERCHIN 2 - Two weeks of study material have been dedicated by Mrs. Estanne Abraham Fawer to honor the twelfth Yahrzeit of her father, Rav Mordechai ben Eliezer Zvi (Rabbi Morton Weiner) Z'L, who passed away on 18 Teves 5760. May the merit of supporting and advancing Dafyomi study -- which was so important to him -- during the weeks of his Yahrzeit serve as an Iluy for his Neshamah. </p>

<p class="bas subject"><span class="nm">1)</span><i>ERCHIN</i> APPLIES TO EVERYONE</p>
<p class="bas indent1"><span class="nm">(a)</span>(If one says "Erech Ploni Alai," this obligates him to give to Hekdesh a certain amount based on Ploni's age and gender - Vayikra 27:2-7. If one says "Demei Ploni Alai," he must give Ploni's monetary (slave) value. Tosfos - we estimate what someone would pay to buy him to be an Eved Kena'ani. Presumably, Rashi argues, for he evaluates Nezek based on one's worth as an Eved <i>Ivri.</i> On 19b we find that evaluations of Damim and Nezek are based on the same kind of slave.)</p>
<p class="bas indent1"><span class="nm">(b)</span><span class="cl">(Mishnah):</span> Everyone can be Ma'arich (pledge to give an Erech), be Ne'erach (others can pledge to give his Erech), Noder (vow to give one's value), or be Nidar (others can vow to give his value), i.e. Kohanim, Leviyim and Yisraelim, women, and slaves. (We now give exceptions to this rule.)</p>
<p class="bas indent1"><span class="nm">(c)</span>A Tumtum or Androginus can be Noder, Nidar and Ma'arich, but he cannot be Ne'erach;</p>
<p class="bas indent2"><span class="nm">1.</span>Only a definite male or female has an Erech.</p>
<p class="bas indent1"><span class="nm">(d)</span>A child, lunatic or Cheresh can be Nidar and Ne'erach, but he cannot be Noder or Ma'arich, for he has no understanding.</p>
<p class="bas indent1"><span class="nm">(e)</span><span class="cl">(Gemara) Question:</span> It says "<i>everyone</i> can be Ma'arich." Whom does this include?</p>
<p class="bas indent1"><span class="nm">(f)</span><span class="cl">Answer:</span> It includes Mufla Samuch l'Ish (a minor shortly before adulthood. If he understands to Whom we vow, his vows takes effect.)</p>
<p class="bas indent1"><span class="nm">(g)</span><span class="cl">Question:</span> (Everyone can be) Ne'erach. Whom does this include?</p>
<p class="bas indent1"><span class="nm">(h)</span><span class="cl">Answer:</span> It includes one who is Menuval and (Tosfos; Rashi - or) Muchas Shechin (disgusting and/or leprous);</p>
<p class="bas indent2"><span class="nm">1.</span>It says "Neder b'Erkecha." One might have thought that Erchin applies precisely to those who can be Nidar. (Menuval or Muchas Shechin has no value, for no one would pay to buy him for a slave.) The Mishnah teaches this is not so. "Nefashos" includes one of any (or no) value.</p>
<p class="bas indent1"><span class="nm">(i)</span><span class="cl">Question:</span> (Everyone can be) Noder. Whom does this include?</p>
<p class="bas indent1"><span class="nm">(j)</span><span class="cl">Answer:</span> This does not teach a Chidush (a law we would not have known). It is taught due to Nidar.</p>
<p class="bas indent1"><span class="nm">(k)</span><span class="cl">Question:</span> Whom does "(<i>everyone</i> can be) Nidar" include?</p>
<p class="bas indent2"><span class="nm">1.</span>It need not include any of the following, for our (or a later) Mishnah explicitly teaches them - a Tumtum, Androginus, child, lunatic, Cheresh, a baby less than a month old, and a Nochri.</p>
<p class="bas indent1"><span class="nm">(l)</span><span class="cl">Answer:</span> Indeed, it includes a baby less than a month old. Our Mishnah alludes to this, and a later Mishnah teaches it explicitly.</p>
<p class="bas subject"><span class="nm">2)</span>INCLUSIONS OF OTHER <i>MISHNAYOS</i> AND <i>BERAISOS</i></p>
<p class="bas indent1"><span class="nm">(a)</span><span class="cl">Question:</span> Whom do we include from "everyone does Semichah" (leans on his Korban before Shechitah)?'</p>
<p class="bas indent1"><span class="nm">(b)</span><span class="cl">Answer:</span> We include an heir (who inherited a Korban). That Mishnah is unlike R. Yehudah.</p>
<p class="bas indent1"><span class="nm">(c)</span><span class="cl">Question:</span> Whom do we include from "everyone can make Temurah (but it is forbidden)"?</p>
<p class="bas indent1"><span class="nm">(d)</span><span class="cl">Answer:</span> We include an heir. That Mishnah is unlike R. Yehudah:</p>
<p class="bas indent2"><span class="nm">1.</span><span class="cl">(Beraisa):</span> An heir does Semichah. An heir can make Temurah;</p>
<p class="bas indent2"><span class="nm">2.</span>R. Yehudah says, an heir does not do Semichah, and he cannot make Temurah.</p>
<p class="bas indent2"><span class="nm">3.</span><span class="cl">Question:</span> What is R. Yehudah's reason?</p>
<p class="bas indent2"><span class="nm">4.</span><span class="cl">Answer:</span> He learns Semichah from "Korbano", but not his father's Korban;</p>
<p class="bas indent3"><span class="nm">i.</span>From the "end"" of Hekdesh (Semichah, which is just before Shechitah) he learns to the beginning of Hekdesh (an heir cannot make Temurah.)</p>
<p class="bas indent2"><span class="nm">5.</span>Chachamim expound "Hamer Yamir" to include an heir (he can make Temurah);</p>
<p class="bas indent3"><span class="nm">i.</span>They learn the end of Hekdesh (Semichah) from its beginning (Temurah). Just like an heir can make Temurah, he can be Somech.</p>
<p class="bas indent1"><span class="nm">(e)</span><span class="cl">Question:</span> How do Chachamim expound (the three times it says) "Korbano"? (It says "Korbano" twice in the Parshah of Semichah. We expound also "Rosho" as if said "Korbano". Alternatively, we also expound a third "Korbano" from another Parshah.)</p>
<p class="bas indent1"><span class="nm">(f)</span><span class="cl">Answer:</span> They teach that Semichah does not apply to a Nochri's Korban, that Reuven may not be Somech on Shimon's Korban, and that every partner on a Korban must be Somech.</p>
<p class="bas indent2"><span class="nm">1.</span>R. Yehudah uses one of the three to exclude an heir. He does not expound that every partner must be Somech. (Rather, one is Somech for all of them);</p>
<p class="bas indent2"><span class="nm">2.</span>Alternatively, he holds that one "Korbano" excludes Semichah on another's Korban, be it a Yisrael or Nochri, and one "Korbano" excludes an heir. (We cannot learn from the first verse, for sometimes an heir is considered just like the deceased.) The third requires all partners to be Somech.</p>

<p class="bas indent1"><span class="nm">(g)</span><span class="cl">Question:</span> How does R. Yehudah expound "Hamer Yamir"?</p>
<p class="bas indent1"><span class="nm">(h)</span><span class="cl">Answer:</span> This includes a woman (she can make Temurah):</p>
<p class="bas indent2"><span class="nm">1.</span><span class="cl">(Beraisa) Question:</span> The entire Parshah of Temurah is written in the masculine. What is the source that it also applies to women?</p>
<p class="bas indent2"><span class="nm">2.</span><span class="cl">Answer:</span> It says "Hamer Yamir."</p>
<p class="bas indent1"><span class="nm">(i)</span>Chachamim expound "v'Im" to include women. R. Yehudah does not expound "v'Im."</p>
<p class="bas indent1"><span class="nm">(j)</span><span class="cl">Question:</span> A Beraisa teaches that "everyone is obligated in the Mitzvah of Sukah." Whom does this include?</p>
<p class="bas indent1"><span class="nm">(k)</span><span class="cl">Answer:</span> It includes a child who does not need his mother. (He does not cry for her when he wakes up during the night).</p>
<p class="bas indent2"><span class="nm">1.</span><span class="cl">(Mishnah):</span> A child who does not need his mother is obligated in Sukah (due to Chinuch, i.e. training in Mitzvos).</p>
<p class="bas indent1"><span class="nm">(l)</span><span class="cl">Question:</span> A Beraisa teaches that "everyone is obligated to take a Lulav" (and the rest of the four species). Whom does this include?</p>
<p class="bas indent1"><span class="nm">(m)</span><span class="cl">Answer:</span> It includes a child who knows how to shake it:</p>
<p class="bas indent2"><span class="nm">1.</span><span class="cl">(Mishnah):</span> A child who knows how to shake is obligated to take a Lulav.</p>
<p class="bas indent1"><span class="nm">(n)</span><span class="cl">Question:</span> A Beraisa teaches that "everyone is obligated to put Tzitzis (on the corners of his four-cornered garment)." Whom does this include?</p>
<p class="bas indent1"><span class="nm">(o)</span><span class="cl">Answer:</span> It includes a child who knows how to cover himself (in a Talis):</p>
<p class="bas indent2"><span class="nm">1.</span><span class="cl">(Beraisa):</span> A child who knows how to wrap himself (in a Talis) is obligated in Tzitzis. (Some say that this is with one in front and one in back on the right, and similarly on the left.)</p>
<p class="bas indent1"><span class="nm">(p)</span><span class="cl">Question:</span> A Beraisa teaches that "everyone is obligated to wear Tefilin." Whom does this include?</p>
<p class="bas indent1"><span class="nm">(q)</span><span class="cl">Answer:</span> It includes a child who knows how to guard (Kedushas) Tefilin. (He will not sleep, emit gas or enter a bathroom while wearing them);</p>
<p class="bas indent2"><span class="nm">1.</span><span class="cl">(Beraisa):</span> When a child knows how to guard Tefilin, his father buys Tefilin for him.</p>
<p class="bas subject"><span class="nm">3)</span>INCLUSIONS OF OTHER <i>MISHNAYOS</i> AND <i>BERAISOS</i> (cont.)</p>
<p class="bas indent1"><span class="nm">(a)</span><span class="cl">Question:</span> A Mishnah teaches that "everyone is obligated in Re'iyah (to enter the Mikdash on each festival and offer an Olah and Shelamim)." Whom does this include?</p>
<p class="bas indent1"><span class="nm">(b)</span><span class="cl">Answer #1:</span> It includes a half-slave. (E.g. one of two partners in a slave freed his half.)</p>
<p class="bas indent1"><span class="nm">(c)</span><span class="cl">Question:</span> According to Ravina, a half-slave is exempt from Re'iyah. What does it include?</p>
<p class="bas indent1"><span class="nm">(d)</span><span class="cl">Answer #2:</span> It includes someone who was lame (and therefore exempt) on the first day of the festival, and healed on the second day.</p>
<p class="bas indent1"><span class="nm">(e)</span><span class="cl">Question:</span> This is like the opinion that all the days are Tashlumim (compensation) for each other. (The Mitzvah intrinsically applies on each day);</p>
<p class="bas indent2"><span class="nm">1.</span>However, according to the opinion that all the days are Tashlumim for the first, since he was exempt on the first day, he is exempt every day!</p>
<p class="bas indent1"><span class="nm">(f)</span><span class="cl">Answer #3:</span> It includes someone blind in one eye. It is unlike the following Tana:</p>
<p class="bas indent2"><span class="nm">1.</span><span class="cl">(Beraisa - Yochanan ben Dehavai):</span> Someone blind in one eye is exempt from Re'iyah;</p>
<p class="bas indent2"><span class="nm">2.</span><span class="cl">Version #1 (Rashi):</span> (In the Parshah of Re'iyah) it is written "Yir'eh" (will see). We read this "Ye'ra'eh". Just like Hash-m sees you with His "two eyes," you see Him (His glory) with two eyes. (One who cannot do so is exempt.)</p>
<p class="bas indent2"><span class="nm">3.</span><span class="cl">Version #2 (R. Gershom):</span> (The Akeidah was at the Makom ha'Mikdash, where) it says "Yir'eh" and "Ye'ra'eh". Just like Hash-m will see those who come (there for Re'iyah) with His "two eyes," He will be seen by those who come with two eyes.</p>
<p class="bas indent2"><span class="nm">4.</span><span class="cl">Version #3 (R. Gershom):</span> Just like Tzara'as must be seen by a Kohen with two (working) eyes (Vayikra 13:12, "l'Chol Mar'eh Einei ha'Kohen"), those who (are obligated to) come for Re'iyah have two eyes.</p>
<p class="bas indent1"><span class="nm">(g)</span><span class="cl">Answer:</span> Answer #1 (it includes a half-slave) is even according to Ravina. Our Mishnah is like the Mishnah Acharonah. Ravina's law is according to the Mishnah Rishonah:</p>
<p class="bas indent2"><span class="nm">1.</span><span class="cl">(Mishnah - Beis Hillel):</span> A half-slave alternates. He serves his master for one day, and himself for one day;</p>
<p class="bas indent2"><span class="nm">2.</span><span class="cl">Beis Shamai:</span> That is good for the master, but not for the slave. He cannot marry!</p>
<p class="bas indent3"><span class="nm">i.</span>He cannot marry a slave (since he is half-free). He cannot marry a Bas Yisrael (since he is a half-slave).</p>
<p class="bas indent3"><span class="nm">ii.</span><span class="cl">Suggestion:</span> Perhaps he will not marry!</p>
<p class="bas indent3"><span class="nm">iii.</span><span class="cl">Rejection:</span> The world was created for the sake of reproduction - "Lasheves Yetzarah"!</p>
<p class="bas indent2"><span class="nm">3.</span>Rather, we force the master to free the slave. The slave writes a document obligating himself to pay the master half of his value.</p>
<p class="bas indent2"><span class="nm">4.</span>Beis Hillel retracted, and agreed with Beis Shamai.</p>
<p class="bas indent1"><span class="nm">(h)</span><span class="cl">Question:</span> A Beraisa teaches that "everyone is obligated to blow the Shofar." Whom does this include?</p>
<p class="bas indent1"><span class="nm">(i)</span><span class="cl">Answer:</span> It includes a child above the age of Chinuch (for this Mitzvah);</p>
<p class="bas indent2"><span class="nm">1.</span><span class="cl">(Mishnah):</span> We do not stop children from blowing a Shofar on Rosh Hashanah. (We encourage them to blow, so they will learn.)</p>
