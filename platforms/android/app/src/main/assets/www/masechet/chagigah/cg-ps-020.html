<p class="bas subject"><span class="nm">1)</span>THE STATUS OF <i>CHULIN</i> PREPARED WITH THE <i>TAHARAH</i> OF <i>KODESH</i></p>
<p class="bas indent1"><span class="nm">(a)</span><span class="cl">(Tana Kama of Beraisa):</span> Chulin prepared with Taharah of Kodesh is treated like Chulin (with no special Dinim).</p>
<p class="bas indent1"><span class="nm">(b)</span><span class="cl">(R. Elazar b'R. Tzadok):</span> It is treated like Terumah.</p>
<p class="bas indent1"><span class="nm">(c)</span><span class="cl">(Tana of our Mishnah):</span> It is treated like Kodesh.</p>
<p class="bas indent2"><span class="nm">1.</span>The Mishnah states that "the clothing of Yochanan ben Gudgeda -- who ate Chulin with the Taharah of Kodesh all his life -- was considered a Midras for Chatas."</p>
<p class="bas indent2"><span class="nm">2.</span>This implies that it was a Midras only for Chatas, but not for Kodesh.</p>
<p class="bas indent2"><span class="nm">3.</span>This teaches that Chulin preparead with the Taharah of Kodesh is treated like Kodesh.</p>
<p class="bas subject"><span class="nm">2)</span>THREE CASES OF GUARDING AN ITEM FROM <i>TUM'AH</i></p>
<p class="bas indent1"><span class="nm">(a)</span><span class="cl">(R. Yochanan ben Elazar):</span> One who dropped his handkerchief and asked someone else to pick it up and return it to him -- the handkerchief is Tamei.</p>
<p class="bas indent2"><span class="nm">1.</span>The person who picked it up did not bother to guard it from Tum'ah, because he assumed the owner was Tamei.</p>
<p class="bas indent1"><span class="nm">(b)</span><span class="cl">(R. Yonasan ben Amram):</span> If one inadvertently donned his Shabbos clothes thinking that they were his weekday clothes, the clothes are Tamei.</p>
<p class="bas indent1"><span class="nm">(c)</span><span class="cl">(R. Elazar bar Tzadok):</span> It once happened that the clothes of two women got mixed up at the bathhouse, and each donned the other's clothing, and R. Akiva declared both sets of clothing to be Tamei.</p>
<p class="bas indent1"><span class="nm">(d)</span><span class="cl">Question:</span> These three cases imply that one who guards an item (from Tum'ah) thinking that it was another item (or while it was in someone else's hands), it is not considered guarded from Tum'ah!</p>
<p class="bas indent2"><span class="nm">1.</span>But two Beraisos say that it <i>is</i> considered guarded as long as he had in mind to guard it!?</p>
<p class="bas indent1"><span class="nm">(e)</span><span class="cl">Answer:</span> It is not a question on two of the three cases mentioned.</p>
<p class="bas indent2"><span class="nm">1.</span>It is not a question on the case of R. Elazar bar Tzadok.</p>
<p class="bas indent3"><span class="nm">i.</span>In that case, each woman assumes that the other woman is an Am ha'Aretz (who is not careful about Tum'ah).</p>
<p class="bas indent3"><span class="nm">ii.</span>Hence, she took her mind off of guarding the other woman's clothing from Tum'ah.</p>
<p class="bas indent2"><span class="nm">2.</span>It is not a question on the case of R. Yonasan ben Amram.</p>
<p class="bas indent3"><span class="nm">i.</span>A person guards his Shabbos clothes from Tum'ah with more diligence.</p>
<p class="bas indent3"><span class="nm">ii.</span>Hence, when he guards them only with the diligence given to weekday clothes, it is considered a Hesech ha'Da'as from guarding his Shabbos clothes.</p>
<p class="bas indent1"><span class="nm">(f)</span><span class="cl">Question:</span> It is a difficulty, though, on R. Yonasan ben Elazar!</p>
<p class="bas indent2"><span class="nm">1.</span>Even though the person who picked it up did not guard it from Tum'ah, the owner should have guarded it while it was in his friend's hands!</p>
<p class="bas indent2"><span class="nm">2.</span>Why, then, is it Tamei?</p>
<p class="bas indent1"><span class="nm">(g)</span><span class="cl">Answer:</span> There is a Chazakah that one does not guard an item from Tum'ah that is in the hands of someone else.</p>

<p class="bas subject"><span class="nm">3)</span><i>MISHNAH</i>: ELEVEN WAYS IN WHICH <i>KODESH</i> IS MORE STRINGENT THAN <i>TERUMAH</i></p>
<p class="bas indent1"><span class="nm">(a)</span>Kodesh is more stringent than Terumah in eleven different ways, as listed.</p>
<p class="bas indent2"><span class="nm">1.</span>We may immerse utensils inside of other utensils in a Mikvah for Terumah, but not for Kodesh.</p>
<p class="bas indent2"><span class="nm">2.</span>Separate parts of the utensil become Tamei for Terumah, but not for Kodesh.</p>
<p class="bas indent2"><span class="nm">3.</span>One may carry Terumah while carrying a Midras, but one may not carry Kodesh.</p>
<p class="bas indent2"><span class="nm">4.</span>The clothing of those who eat Terumah are a Midras for Kodesh.</p>
<p class="bas indent2"><span class="nm">5.</span>When immersing garments for Kodesh, one must first untie them and dry them, but for Terumah one may immerse them while they are knotted (and/or wet).</p>
<p class="bas indent2"><span class="nm">6.</span>Utensils that were completed with Taharah still need Tevilah for Kodesh, but not for Terumah.</p>
<p class="bas indent2"><span class="nm">7.</span>A utensil joins all of its contents together for Kodesh, but not for Terumah.</p>
<p class="bas indent2"><span class="nm">8.</span>Tum'ah of Kodesh extends to a fourth level, while that of Terumah extends only to a third level.</p>
<p class="bas indent2"><span class="nm">9.</span>For Terumah, if one hand became Tamei, the other remains Tahor, while for Kodesh, one must immerse both hands, because one hand is Metamei the other for Kodesh but not for Terumah.</p>
<p class="bas indent2"><span class="nm">10.</span>One may eat Terumah foods that are dry, with hands that are Tamei, but not Kodesh foods.</p>
