<div class="subject"><span class="nm">1)</span><p>THE STATUS OF CHULIN PREPARED WITH THE TAHARAH OF KODESH</p></div>
<div class="indent1"><span class="nm">(a)</span><p><span class="cl">(Tana Kama of Beraisa):</span> Chulin prepared with Taharah of Kodesh is treated like Chulin (with no special Dinim).</p></div>
<div class="indent1"><span class="nm">(b)</span><p><span class="cl">(R. Elazar b'R. Tzadok):</span> It is treated like Terumah.</p></div>
<div class="indent1"><span class="nm">(c)</span><p><span class="cl">(Tana of our Mishnah):</span> It is treated like Kodesh.</p></div>
<div class="indent2"><span class="nm">1.</span><p>The Mishnah states that "the clothing of Yochanan ben Gudgeda -- who ate Chulin with the Taharah of Kodesh all his life -- was considered a Midras for Chatas."</p></div>
<div class="indent2"><span class="nm">2.</span><p>This implies that it was a Midras only for Chatas, but not for Kodesh.</p></div>
<div class="indent2"><span class="nm">3.</span><p>This teaches that Chulin preparead with the Taharah of Kodesh is treated like Kodesh.</p></div>
<div class="subject"><span class="nm">2)</span><p>THREE CASES OF GUARDING AN ITEM FROM TUM'AH</p></div>
<div class="indent1"><span class="nm">(a)</span><p><span class="cl">(R. Yochanan ben Elazar):</span> One who dropped his handkerchief and asked someone else to pick it up and return it to him -- the handkerchief is Tamei.</p></div>
<div class="indent2"><span class="nm">1.</span><p>The person who picked it up did not bother to guard it from Tum'ah, because he assumed the owner was Tamei.</p></div>
<div class="indent1"><span class="nm">(b)</span><p><span class="cl">(R. Yonasan ben Amram):</span> If one inadvertently donned his Shabbos clothes thinking that they were his weekday clothes, the clothes are Tamei.</p></div>
<div class="indent1"><span class="nm">(c)</span><p><span class="cl">(R. Elazar bar Tzadok):</span> It once happened that the clothes of two women got mixed up at the bathhouse, and each donned the other's clothing, and R. Akiva declared both sets of clothing to be Tamei.</p></div>
<div class="indent1"><span class="nm">(d)</span><p><span class="cl">Question:</span> These three cases imply that one who guards an item (from Tum'ah) thinking that it was another item (or while it was in someone else's hands), it is not considered guarded from Tum'ah!</p></div>
<div class="indent2"><span class="nm">1.</span><p>But two Beraisos say that it <i>is</i> considered guarded as long as he had in mind to guard it!?</p></div>
<div class="indent1"><span class="nm">(e)</span><p><span class="cl">Answer:</span> It is not a question on two of the three cases mentioned.</p></div>
<div class="indent2"><span class="nm">1.</span><p>It is not a question on the case of R. Elazar bar Tzadok.</p></div>
<div class="indent3"><span class="nm">i.</span><p>In that case, each woman assumes that the other woman is an Am ha'Aretz (who is not careful about Tum'ah).</p></div>
<div class="indent3"><span class="nm">ii.</span><p>Hence, she took her mind off of guarding the other woman's clothing from Tum'ah.</p></div>
<div class="indent2"><span class="nm">2.</span><p>It is not a question on the case of R. Yonasan ben Amram.</p></div>
<div class="indent3"><span class="nm">i.</span><p>A person guards his Shabbos clothes from Tum'ah with more diligence.</p></div>
<div class="indent3"><span class="nm">ii.</span><p>Hence, when he guards them only with the diligence given to weekday clothes, it is considered a Hesech ha'Da'as from guarding his Shabbos clothes.</p></div>
<div class="indent1"><span class="nm">(f)</span><p><span class="cl">Question:</span> It is a difficulty, though, on R. Yonasan ben Elazar!</p></div>
<div class="indent2"><span class="nm">1.</span><p>Even though the person who picked it up did not guard it from Tum'ah, the owner should have guarded it while it was in his friend's hands!</p></div>
<div class="indent2"><span class="nm">2.</span><p>Why, then, is it Tamei?</p></div>
<div class="indent1"><span class="nm">(g)</span><p><span class="cl">Answer:</span> There is a Chazakah that one does not guard an item from Tum'ah that is in the hands of someone else.</p></div>

<div class="subject"><span class="nm">3)</span><p>MISHNAH: ELEVEN WAYS IN WHICH KODESH IS MORE STRINGENT THAN TERUMAH</p></div>
<div class="indent1"><span class="nm">(a)</span><p>Kodesh is more stringent than Terumah in eleven different ways, as listed.</p></div>
<div class="indent2"><span class="nm">1.</span><p>We may immerse utensils inside of other utensils in a Mikvah for Terumah, but not for Kodesh.</p></div>
<div class="indent2"><span class="nm">2.</span><p>Separate parts of the utensil become Tamei for Terumah, but not for Kodesh.</p></div>
<div class="indent2"><span class="nm">3.</span><p>One may carry Terumah while carrying a Midras, but one may not carry Kodesh.</p></div>
<div class="indent2"><span class="nm">4.</span><p>The clothing of those who eat Terumah are a Midras for Kodesh.</p></div>
<div class="indent2"><span class="nm">5.</span><p>When immersing garments for Kodesh, one must first untie them and dry them, but for Terumah one may immerse them while they are knotted (and/or wet).</p></div>
<div class="indent2"><span class="nm">6.</span><p>Utensils that were completed with Taharah still need Tevilah for Kodesh, but not for Terumah.</p></div>
<div class="indent2"><span class="nm">7.</span><p>A utensil joins all of its contents together for Kodesh, but not for Terumah.</p></div>
<div class="indent2"><span class="nm">8.</span><p>Tum'ah of Kodesh extends to a fourth level, while that of Terumah extends only to a third level.</p></div>
<div class="indent2"><span class="nm">9.</span><p>For Terumah, if one hand became Tamei, the other remains Tahor, while for Kodesh, one must immerse both hands, because one hand is Metamei the other for Kodesh but not for Terumah.</p></div>
<div class="indent2"><span class="nm">10.</span><p>One may eat Terumah foods that are dry, with hands that are Tamei, but not Kodesh foods.</p></div>
