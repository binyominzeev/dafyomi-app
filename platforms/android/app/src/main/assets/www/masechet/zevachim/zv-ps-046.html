<div class="subject"><span class="nm">1)</span><p>ISURIM THAT APPLY TO BLOOD</p></div>
<div class="indent1"><span class="nm">(a)</span><p><span class="cl">(Mishnah):</span> (Nosar and Tamei apply to Kodshim regarding which Pigul does not apply,) except for blood.</p></div>
<div class="indent1"><span class="nm">(b)</span><p><span class="cl">Question:</span> What is the source of this?</p></div>
<div class="indent1"><span class="nm">(c)</span><p><span class="cl">Answer:</span> Three exclusions teach that Me'ilah does not apply to blood. (Later, we will use two of them to teach that Nosar and Tamei do not apply to blood.)</p></div>
<div class="indent2"><span class="nm">1.</span><p><span class="cl">(Ula):</span> "Va'Ani Nesativ <i>Lachem</i>" - blood is yours (it is not considered Hash-m's, so there is no Me'ilah);</p></div>
<div class="indent2"><span class="nm">2.</span><p><span class="cl">(Tana d'Vei R. Yishmael):</span> "Lechaper" - it is for Kaparah, and not for Me'ilah;</p></div>
<div class="indent2"><span class="nm">3.</span><p><span class="cl">(R. Yochanan):</span> "Hu" - blood has the same status before Kaparah as after;</p></div>
<div class="indent3"><span class="nm">i.</span><p>Just like after Kaparah there is no Me'ilah, also before.</p></div>
<div class="indent2"><span class="nm">4.</span><p><span class="cl">Suggestion:</span> Perhaps just like before Kaparah there is Me'ilah, also after!</p></div>
<div class="indent2"><span class="nm">5.</span><p><span class="cl">Rejection:</span> Me'ilah never applies to something (used for a Mitzvah) after the Mitzvah was done.</p></div>
<div class="indent2"><span class="nm">6.</span><p><span class="cl">Question:</span> Me'ilah applies to Terumas ha'Deshen after the Mitzvah!</p></div>
<div class="indent2"><span class="nm">7.</span><p><span class="cl">Answer:</span> Terumas ha'Deshen and Bigdei Lavan (that the Kohen Gadol wears in the Kodesh ha'Kodoshim on Yom Kipur) are Shnei Kesuvim (two verses, one of which teaches something which could have been learned from the other, e.g. that Me'ilah applies after the Mitzvah was done), so they do not teach to other cases.</p></div>
<div class="indent2"><span class="nm">8.</span><p><span class="cl">Question:</span> This is like Chachamim, who expound "v'Hinicham Sham" to obligate Genizah for Bigdei Lavan (they may not be used again);</p></div>
<div class="indent3"><span class="nm">i.</span><p>According to R. Dosa, who says that they may not be used on another Yom Kipur, but a regular Kohen may use them, how can we answer?</p></div>
<div class="indent2"><span class="nm">9.</span><p><span class="cl">Answer:</span> Terumas ha'Deshen and Eglah Arufah are Shnei Kesuvim. They do not teach to other cases.</p></div>
<div class="indent2"><span class="nm">10.</span><p><span class="cl">Question:</span> This is like the opinion that Shnei Kesuvim do not teach to other cases. According to the opinion that they do teach, how can we answer?</p></div>
<div class="indent2"><span class="nm">11.</span><p><span class="cl">Answer:</span> They are not Shnei Kesuvim, because we could not have learned one from the other. Regarding each, a verse teaches not to learn to other cases:</p></div>
<div class="indent3"><span class="nm">i.</span><p>It says "<i>ha</i>'Arufah" and "v'Sam<i>o</i>" (but normally, there is no Me'ilah after the Mitzvah).</p></div>
<div class="indent2"><span class="nm">12.</span><p><span class="cl">Question:</span> Why do we need three exclusions to teach that Me'ilah does not apply to blood?</p></div>
<div class="indent2"><span class="nm">13.</span><p><span class="cl">Answer (and culmination of answer (c)):</span> One teaches that Me'ilah does not apply to blood. The others teach that Nosar and Tamei do not apply to blood.</p></div>
<div class="indent1"><span class="nm">(d)</span><p>We do not need a verse to teach that Pigul does not apply. Pigul applies only to something that <i>has</i> Matirim, but blood is a Matir for other things.</p></div>
<div class="subject"><span class="nm">2)</span><p>KARES FOR TUM'AH</p></div>
<div class="indent1"><span class="nm">(a)</span><p><span class="cl">Question (R. Yochanan):</span> Why does the Torah teach Kares three times regarding eating Shelamim b'Tum'ah?</p></div>
<div class="bbbline">46b----------------------------------------46b</p></div>
<div class="indent1"><span class="nm">(b)</span><p><span class="cl">Answer:</span> One is a Klal, one makes it considered something included in a Klal that received a new law, to teach about the entire Klal (i.e. that Kares for Tum'ah applies to Kodshei Mizbe'ach, but not to Kodshei Bedek ha'Bayis), and one teaches that one is liable for things not normally eaten.</p></div>
<div class="indent1"><span class="nm">(c)</span><p><span class="cl">Question:</span> R. Shimon exempts for things not normally eaten. How does he expound the third Kares?</p></div>
<div class="indent1"><span class="nm">(d)</span><p><span class="cl">Answer:</span> It teaches that one is liable for inner Chata'os;</p></div>
<div class="indent2"><span class="nm">1.</span><p>One might have thought that since (he holds that) one is not liable for Pigul of inner Chata'os, one is not liable for eating them b'Tum'ah. the extra verse teaches that this is not so.</p></div>
<div class="indent1"><span class="nm">(e)</span><p><span class="cl">(Mishnah - R. Shimon):</span> One is liable for things that are normally eaten...</p></div>
<div class="indent1"><span class="nm">(f)</span><p><span class="cl">Version #1 - Rav Tivyomi - ((R. Yochanan or Reish Lakish), or, (R. Elazar or R. Yosi b'Rebbi Chanina)):</span> They argue about eating (Kodesh that is not normally eaten) b'Tum'as Basar (when the Kodesh itself is Tamei. Chachamim Mechayev, and R. Shimon exempts), but all agree that one is not lashed for Tum'as ha'Guf;</p></div>
<div class="indent1"><span class="nm">(g)</span><p><span class="cl">(A Chacham from the other pair):</span> They argue in both cases.</p></div>
<div class="indent1"><span class="nm">(h)</span><p><span class="cl">Question:</span> Why are Chachamim Mechayev even for Tum'as ha'Guf?</p></div>
<div class="indent1"><span class="nm">(i)</span><p><span class="cl">Answer:</span> Since "veha'Basar Asher Yiga b'Chol Tamei (Lo Ye'achel)" applies, also "v'Tum'aso Alav (v'Nichresah)" applies.</p></div>
<div class="indent1"><span class="nm">(j)</span><p><span class="cl">Version #2 (Rav Kahana):</span> The Amora'im discussed the Seifa (R. Shimon exempts for eating wood, frankincense or Ketores b'Tum'ah.)</p></div>
<div class="indent1"><span class="nm">(k)</span><p><span class="cl">(R. Yochanan or Reish Lakish, or, R. Elazar or R. Yosi b'Rebbi Chanina):</span> They argue about Tum'as ha'Guf (R. Shimon exempts and Chachamim are Mechayev), but all agree that one is lashed for Tum'as Basar;</p></div>
<div class="indent1"><span class="nm">(l)</span><p><span class="cl">(A Chacham from the other pair):</span> They argue in both cases.</p></div>
<div class="indent1"><span class="nm">(m)</span><p><span class="cl">(Rava):</span> Presumably, the latter opinion is correct.</p></div>
<div class="indent1"><span class="nm">(n)</span><p><span class="cl">Question:</span> What is the reason?</p></div>
<div class="indent1"><span class="nm">(o)</span><p><span class="cl">Answer:</span> Since R. Shimon holds that "veha'Basar Asher Yiga..." does not apply, neither does "v'Tum'aso Alav".</p></div>
<div class="indent1"><span class="nm">(p)</span><p><span class="cl">Question:</span> It was taught that "veha'Basar" includes wood and frankincense (they can become Tamei, or perhaps only Pasul. We must say that one who eats them is liable!)</p></div>
<div class="indent1"><span class="nm">(q)</span><p><span class="cl">Answer:</span> Indeed, they are forbidden (Tosfos - mid'Oraisa; Rashi - mid'Rabanan), but one is not lashed for them.</p></div>
<div class="subject"><span class="nm">3)</span><p>THE PROPER INTENTS FOR <i>KORBANOS</i></p></div>
<div class="indent1"><span class="nm">(a)</span><p><span class="cl">(Mishnah):</span> There are six intents in Korbanos:</p></div>
<div class="indent2"><span class="nm">1.</span><p>Which Korban it is, whose Korban it is, it is l'Shem (for the sake of) Hash-m, l'Shem the fire, l'Shem a smell, and to be pleasing (these will be explained);</p></div>
<div class="indent2"><span class="nm">2.</span><p>Additionally, a Chatas or Asham is offered l'Shem the transgression.</p></div>
<div class="indent1"><span class="nm">(b)</span><p>R. Yosi says, even if one slaughtered without any intent, it is Kosher;</p></div>
<div class="indent2"><span class="nm">1.</span><p>Chachamim enacted to slaughter without intent, for everything depends on the intent of the Oved (the one offering the Korban).</p></div>
<div class="indent1"><span class="nm">(c)</span><p><span class="cl">(Gemara - Rav Yehudah):</span> "Olah" - an Olah is offered l'Shem Olah (as opposed to l'Shem Shelamim);</p></div>
<div class="indent2"><span class="nm">1.</span><p>"Ishei" - the Eimurim should burn totally, not to merely grill them (Rashi; Ramban (on Chumash) - they are burned on the fire, not on coals);</p></div>
<div class="indent2"><span class="nm">2.</span><p>"Re'ach" - (the meat should make a nice smell on the Mizbe'ach, so) it should not be roasted first;</p></div>
<div class="indent3"><span class="nm">i.</span><p><span class="cl">(Rav Yehudah):</span> If limbs were roasted before they were offered, he did not fulfill "Re'ach".</p></div>
<div class="indent2"><span class="nm">3.</span><p>"Nicho'ach" - he must intend that it will be pleasing to Hash-m;</p></div>
<div class="indent2"><span class="nm">4.</span><p>"La'Shem" - he intends for Hash-m, Creator of the world;</p></div>
<div class="indent1"><span class="nm">(d)</span><p><span class="cl">(Rav Yehudah):</span> If a Chatas was slaughtered l'Shem Olah, it is Pasul. If it was slaughtered l'Shem Chulin, it is Kosher.</p></div>
<div class="indent1"><span class="nm">(e)</span><p><span class="cl">(R. Elazar):</span> He expounds "v'Lo Yechalelu Es Kodshei Bnei Yisrael" - (intents for other) Kodshim are Mechalel (disqualify) Kodshim, but (intent for) Chulin is not.</p></div>
<div class="indent1"><span class="nm">(f)</span><p><span class="cl">Question (Rabah - Mishnah - R. Yosi):</span> Even if one slaughtered without any intent, it is Kosher. This is an enactment of Chachamim (to slaughter without intent).</p></div>
<div class="indent2"><span class="nm">1.</span><p><span class="cl">Inference:</span> It is Kosher because he had no intent. Had he intended for Chulin (or any other improper intent), it would be Pasul!</p></div>
<div class="indent1"><span class="nm">(g)</span><p><span class="cl">Answer (Abaye):</span> No. When he had no intent, it is Kosher and Meratzeh (he was Yotzei);</p></div>
<div class="indent2"><span class="nm">1.</span><p>If he intended for Chulin, it is Kosher, but it is not Meratzeh.</p></div>
<div class="indent1"><span class="nm">(h)</span><p><span class="cl">(R. Elazar):</span> If Reuven (knowingly) slaughtered a Chatas l'Shem (to be) Chulin, it is Kosher;</p></div>
<div class="indent2"><span class="nm">1.</span><p>If he thought that it was Chulin (and slaughtered l'Shem Chulin), it is Pasul.</p></div>
<div class="indent1"><span class="nm">(i)</span><p>Shmuel and Rav Huna agree with the latter law.</p></div>
<div class="indent2"><span class="nm">1.</span><p><span class="cl">Question (Shmuel):</span> What is the source that Misasek (one who did not intend for the action he did) is Pasul in Kodshim?</p></div>
<div class="indent2"><span class="nm">2.</span><p><span class="cl">Answer #1 (Rav Huna):</span> "V'Shachat Es Ben ha'Bakar" - the Shechitah must be l'Shem an ox (Korban).</p></div>
<div class="indent2"><span class="nm">3.</span><p><span class="cl">Shmuel:</span> I knew that l'Chatchilah, it must be l'Shem the Korban! I asked for the source that this is Me'akev.</p></div>
<div class="indent2"><span class="nm">4.</span><p><span class="cl">Answer #2 (Rav Huna):</span> "Lirtzonchem Tizbechuhu" - you must slaughter it knowingly.</p></div>
