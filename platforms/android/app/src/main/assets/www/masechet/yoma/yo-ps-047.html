<p class="dedicationbox">YOMA 47 - Two weeks of study material have been dedicated by Mrs. Estanne Abraham Fawer to honor the Yahrzeit of her father, Rav Mordechai ben Eliezer Zvi (Rabbi Morton Weiner) Z'L, who passed away on 18 Teves 5760. May the merit of supporting and advancing Dafyomi study -- which was so important to him -- during the weeks of his Yahrzeit serve as an Iluy for his Neshamah. </p>

<div class="subject"><span class="nm">1)</span><p>MISHNAH: THE KETORES</p></div>
<div class="indent1"><span class="nm">(a)</span><p>They bring out the Kaf and the Machtah, from which the Kohen Gadol removes a M'lo Chofnav and places it in the Kaf.</p></div>
<div class="indent1"><span class="nm">(b)</span><p>The Chafnayim varied according to the size of the Kohen.</p></div>
<div class="indent1"><span class="nm">(c)</span><p>This was its measure.</p></div>
<div class="indent1"><span class="nm">(d)</span><p>He then took the Machtah of coals in his right hand and the Kaf of Ketores in his left (to the Kodesh ha'Kodoshim).</p></div>
<div class="subject"><span class="nm">2)</span><p>THE KAF AND MACHTAH</p></div>
<div class="indent1"><span class="nm">(a)</span><p><span class="cl">Question:</span> We learned in the previous Mishnah that he went up to the Mizbe'ach with the Machtah (already in hand)!?</p></div>
<div class="indent1"><span class="nm">(b)</span><p><span class="cl">Answer:</span> That was the Machtah for the coals, and now they brought him a Machtah of Ketores (as in the Beraisa).</p></div>
<div class="indent1"><span class="nm">(c)</span><p><span class="cl">Question:</span> Why does he need a Kaf on Yom Kipur?</p></div>
<div class="indent1"><span class="nm">(d)</span><p><span class="cl">Answer:</span> It was otherwise impossible.</p></div>
<div class="indent2"><span class="nm">1.</span><p>He cannot make two trips.</p></div>
<div class="indent2"><span class="nm">2.</span><p>He would have no hands free to put down the Machtah.</p></div>
<div class="indent2"><span class="nm">3.</span><p>It is inappropriate for him to use his teeth.</p></div>
<div class="indent2"><span class="nm">4.</span><p>Thus we learn from the Nesi'im who used a Kaf.</p></div>
<div class="indent1"><span class="nm">(e)</span><p><span class="cl">Question:</span> How can he place the less important stranger (Machtah) in his right hand and the citizen (Ketores) in his left?</p></div>
<div class="indent1"><span class="nm">(f)</span><p><span class="cl">Answer:</span> The Machtah was heavier than the Ketores (and we continue to do so even in the exceptional case that the Kohen was large enough to scoop a very large Chafnayim).</p></div>
<div class="indent1"><span class="nm">(g)</span><p>R. Yishmael, the son of Kimchis, would scoop four Kav of Ketores and boast that his mother exceded the others (either the cereal she ate or the 'select' Zera [as R. Avahu taught by resolving the two different occurrences of va'Tazreini]).</p></div>
<div class="subject"><span class="nm">3)</span><p>THE SONS OF KIMCHIS</p></div>
<div class="indent1"><span class="nm">(a)</span><p>One Yom Kipur R. Yishmael b. Kimchis became Tamei from the spittle of a gentile, and his brother, Yeshvav took his place, thus two of the sons of Kimchis merited the office.</p></div>
<div class="indent1"><span class="nm">(b)</span><p>The next time this happened, his brother Yosef took his place.</p></div>
<div class="indent1"><span class="nm">(c)</span><p>In the end all seven of her sons served as Kohanim Gedolim.</p></div>
<div class="indent1"><span class="nm">(d)</span><p>She credited her success to her modesty, while the Chachamim indicated that others had done similarly but had not merited such honor.</p></div>
<div class="subject"><span class="nm">4)</span><p>THE SIZE OF THE KOMETZ</p></div>
<div class="indent1"><span class="nm">(a)</span><p>"be'Kumtzo" teaches us not to make a fixed measure for the Kometz.</p></div>
<div class="indent1"><span class="nm">(b)</span><p><span class="cl">Question:</span> What about making such a measure for the Chafinah?</p></div>
<div class="indent2"><span class="nm">1.</span><p>Does "be'Kumtzo" only apply to the Kometz; or</p></div>
<div class="indent2"><span class="nm">2.</span><p>Does "M'lo" connect the Chafinah to the Kometz?</p></div>
<div class="indent1"><span class="nm">(c)</span><p><span class="cl">Answer:</span> The Mishnah teaches so is its measure.</p></div>
<div class="indent2"><span class="nm">1.</span><p>This appears to permit making a measure for Chafinah.</p></div>
<div class="indent2"><span class="nm">2.</span><p>No, it means that he measured it the same way (again) inside the Kodshei Kodshim.</p></div>
<div class="indent1"><span class="nm">(d)</span><p><span class="cl">Question:</span> Then it seems that he repeated the Chafinah?!</p></div>
<div class="indent1"><span class="nm">(e)</span><p><span class="cl">Answer:</span> It could mean to permit making a measure (and the interpretation could be pushed back and forth).</p></div>
<div class="indent1"><span class="nm">(f)</span><p><span class="cl">Alternate Answer:</span> 'Its measure' means that he must take precisely a Chafnayim-full, not more nor less.</p></div>
<div class="subject"><span class="nm">5)</span><p>TAKING THE KOMETZ</p></div>
<div class="indent1"><span class="nm">(a)</span><p>The Beraisa understands M'lo Kumtzo to teach that:</p></div>
<div class="indent2"><span class="nm">1.</span><p>It may not be full to overflowing.</p></div>
<div class="indent2"><span class="nm">2.</span><p>It may not be only on his fingertips.</p></div>
<div class="indent2"><span class="nm">3.</span><p>It must be a full fistful in his hand, closing three fingers around it.</p></div>
<div class="bbbline">47b----------------------------------------47b</p></div>
<div class="indent1"><span class="nm">(b)</span><p>When he must take the Kometz from the Minchas Machavas and Marcheshes he must use his thumb and pinky to clear the overflow from Birutzin (this is the most difficult Avodah to get precisely correct).</p></div>
<div class="indent1"><span class="nm">(c)</span><p><span class="cl">Question:</span> But we learned that Melikah and (the second) Chafinah are the most difficult!?</p></div>
<div class="indent1"><span class="nm">(d)</span><p><span class="cl">Answer:</span> This is <i>one of</i> the most difficult.</p></div>
<div class="indent1"><span class="nm">(e)</span><p><span class="cl">Question:</span> What is the status of the flour found between his clenched fingers (that which is not clearly within or without)?</p></div>
<div class="indent1"><span class="nm">(f)</span><p><span class="cl">Answer:</span> It is a Safek and he offers the Kometz first, and then he offers the flour between his fingers.</p></div>
<div class="indent2"><span class="nm">1.</span><p>He cannot offer the doubtful flour first since it might impair the proper measure of the Kometz.</p></div>
<div class="indent2"><span class="nm">2.</span><p>We learned that such impaired Shirayim do not allow for the Kometz to be brought.</p></div>
<div class="indent1"><span class="nm">(g)</span><p><span class="cl">Question:</span> But it is prohibited to bring the doubtful flour after the proper Haktarah was done!?</p></div>
<div class="indent1"><span class="nm">(h)</span><p><span class="cl">Answer:</span> He brings the doubtful flour as though it were wood.</p></div>
<div class="indent2"><span class="nm">1.</span><p>This is supported by the teaching of R. Eliezer:</p></div>
<div class="indent2"><span class="nm">2.</span><p>After an offering the leftovers cannot be brought as that Korban, but they may be brought as wood.</p></div>
<div class="indent1"><span class="nm">(i)</span><p><span class="cl">Question:</span> But according to Rabanan (who prohibit bringing the leftovers even as wood), how will he offer the doubtful flour after?</p></div>
<div class="indent1"><span class="nm">(j)</span><p><span class="cl">Answer:</span> Let the Kemitzah then be performed by heavy Kohanim whose fleshy fingers do not create this doubtful flour.</p></div>
<div class="indent1"><span class="nm">(k)</span><p>If that were so, R. Eliezer would then require the same.</p></div>
<div class="subject"><span class="nm">6)</span><p>RAV PAPA'S QUESTIONS ABOUT KEMITZAH AND CHAFINAH</p></div>
<div class="indent1"><span class="nm">(a)</span><p><span class="cl">Question:</span> What is the status of the inter-finger flour of a M'lo Chafnav (perhaps Birutzin are acceptable by Chafinah)?</p></div>
<div class="indent2"><span class="nm">1.</span><p>This would seem to hinge on the same Gezeirah Shavah ("M'lo" "M'lo") that prohibits Birutzin by Kemitzah!</p></div>
<div class="indent2"><span class="nm">2.</span><p>His question, rather, was whether unintended taking is valid and may be brought ("M'lo Chafnav") or not ("ve'lakach-ve'Heivi").</p></div>
<div class="indent1"><span class="nm">(b)</span><p><span class="cl">Answer:</span> Teiku.</p></div>
<div class="indent1"><span class="nm">(c)</span><p><span class="cl">Question:</span> Would a fingertip or upward Kemitzah be considered as a common person would scoop a Kometz?  What of a sideways Kemitzah?</p></div>
<div class="indent1"><span class="nm">(d)</span><p><span class="cl">Answer to all three:</span> Teiku.</p></div>
<div class="indent1"><span class="nm">(e)</span><p><span class="cl">Question:</span> Would a fingertip, upward or sideways Chafinah be considered its usual manner? What if he scooped with each hand separately and then brought his hands together?</p></div>
<div class="indent1"><span class="nm">(f)</span><p><span class="cl">Answer to all four:</span> Teiku.</p></div>
