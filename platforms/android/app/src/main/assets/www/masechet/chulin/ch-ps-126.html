<div class="subject"><span class="nm">1)</span><p>COVERED TUM'AH (cont.)</p></div>
<div class="indent1"><span class="nm">(a)</span><p><span class="cl">(Beraisa - R. Yosi):</span> It is Tahor.</p></div>
<div class="indent1"><span class="nm">(b)</span><p><span class="cl">Question:</span> (R. Yosi responded to Chachamim.) Which teaching did he address?</p></div>
<div class="indent2"><span class="nm">1.</span><p>He cannot discuss (either law of) the Seifa, for also Chachamim are Metaher!</p></div>
<div class="indent1"><span class="nm">(c)</span><p><span class="cl">Answer:</span> Rather, Chachamim have two reasons to be Metamei, and he argues about both:</p></div>
<div class="indent2"><span class="nm">1.</span><p>In the Reisha, Chachamim are Metamei because it is the nature of Tum'ah to leave. R. Yosi is Metaher, for perhaps a complete k'Zayis will not leave at once, or it might be burned in its place;</p></div>
<div class="indent2"><span class="nm">2.</span><p>In the Seifa, Chachamim are Metaher only because the cupboard is a Tefach deep. If not, the covered Tum'ah would pierce through. R. Yosi says that it does not pass through.</p></div>
<div class="indent1"><span class="nm">(d)</span><p><span class="cl">Contradiction:</span> Elsewhere, R. Yosi says that covered Tum'ah goes through the covering!</p></div>
<div class="indent2"><span class="nm">1.</span><p><span class="cl">(Mishnah - R. Meir):</span> If a dog ate flesh of a Mes and died (within three days) and is resting on the threshold, it brings the Tum'ah into the house only if the opening of its neck is (at least) a Tefach (by a Tefach);</p></div>
<div class="indent2"><span class="nm">2.</span><p>R. Yosi says, it depends. If it (the Tum'ah inside the dog) is inside the doorway (or house), the house is Tamei. If it is outside the doorway, the house is Tahor.</p></div>
<div class="indent2"><span class="nm">3.</span><p>R. Elazar says, if the dog's mouth is in the house (and the Tum'ah and rectum are out), the house is Tamei. if its mouth is out (and the rectum is in), the house is Tahor.</p></div>
<div class="indent2"><span class="nm">4.</span><p>R. Yehudah ben Beseira says, in either case the house is Tamei.</p></div>
<div class="indent2"><span class="nm">5.</span><p><span class="cl">Summation of question - suggestion:</span> R. Yosi discusses when the neck is not a Tefach thick. Even though the Tum'ah is covered, it pierces through and it is Metamei the house (if it is inside the doorway)!</p></div>
<div class="indent1"><span class="nm">(e)</span><p><span class="cl">Answer (Rava):</span> No. R. Yosi says that we look at the interior of (what brings) the Tum'ah (i.e. the neck, if it is a Tefach by a Tefach). He argues with R. Meir about two matters;</p></div>
<div class="indent2"><span class="nm">1.</span><p>R. Meir says that if the neck is a Tefach, it brings Tum'ah. R. Yosi says the interior must be a Tefach;</p></div>
<div class="indent2"><span class="nm">2.</span><p>R. Meir holds that the roof above the entire threshold brings Tum'ah to the house. R. Yehudah says so only for the part inside the doorway.</p></div>
<div class="indent1"><span class="nm">(f)</span><p><span class="cl">Support:</span> In Rav Acha brei d'Rava's text of the Beraisa, R. Yosi explicitly says 'we look at the hollow in which the Tum'ah is.'</p></div>
<div class="subject"><span class="nm">2)</span><p>TUM'OS THAT ARE TAMEI IN TWO WAYS</p></div>
<div class="indent1"><span class="nm">(a)</span><p><span class="cl">Question:</span> Who is the Tana that argues with R. Yosi and says that towering is not called touching?</p></div>
<div class="indent1"><span class="nm">(b)</span><p><span class="cl">Answer:</span> It is R. Shimon;</p></div>
<div class="bbbline">126b----------------------------------------126b</p></div>
<div class="indent2"><span class="nm">1.</span><p><span class="cl">(Beraisa - R. Shimon):</span> There are three Tum'os of Mes, each of which is Metamei in exactly two of the three possible ways:</p></div>
<div class="indent3"><span class="nm">i.</span><p>A spoon of Rekev has Tum'as Ohel and Masa, but not Maga;</p></div>
<div class="indent3"><span class="nm">ii.</span><p>A bone the size of a barley seed has Tum'as Maga and Masa, but not Ohel;</p></div>
<div class="indent3"><span class="nm">iii.</span><p>Golel and Dofek (Rashi - the cover of a coffin and its support) have Tum'as Ohel and Maga, but not Masa.</p></div>
<div class="indent1"><span class="nm">(c)</span><p><span class="cl">(Mishnah):</span> The femur of a Nevelah or Sheretz...</p></div>
<div class="indent1"><span class="nm">(d)</span><p><span class="cl">(Beraisa):</span> "Nivlaso (is Tamei)", but not a femur without a hole.</p></div>
<div class="indent2"><span class="nm">1.</span><p><span class="cl">Suggestion:</span> Perhaps it is Tahor even if it has a hole!</p></div>
<div class="indent2"><span class="nm">2.</span><p><span class="cl">Rejection:</span> "One who touches will become Tamei" - something that contains Tum'ah (e.g. a bone with marrow) is Tamei only if the Tum'ah can be touched.</p></div>
<div class="indent2"><span class="nm">3.</span><p><span class="cl">Question (R. Zeira):</span> If so, one who touches the skin of a complete Nevelah should be Tahor!</p></div>
<div class="indent2"><span class="nm">4.</span><p><span class="cl">Answer (Abaye):</span> There are holes in the skin (openings of the mouth, nose and eyes).</p></div>
<div class="indent2"><span class="nm">5.</span><p><span class="cl">Question (Rav Papa):</span> One who touches the Chelev (it itself is Tahor) surrounding a kidney (of a Nevelah) should be Tahor!</p></div>
<div class="indent2"><span class="nm">6.</span><p><span class="cl">Answer (Rava):</span> Strands of meat exude from it.</p></div>
<div class="indent1"><span class="nm">(e)</span><p><span class="cl">Question (R. Oshaya):</span> If one planned to puncture the femur, but did not, is it Tamei?</p></div>
<div class="indent2"><span class="nm">1.</span><p>Is it Tahor until punctured;</p></div>
<div class="indent2"><span class="nm">2.</span><p>Or, is it as if it was punctured?</p></div>
<div class="indent1"><span class="nm">(f)</span><p><span class="cl">Answer (R. Oshaya):</span> It is Tamei.</p></div>
<div class="subject"><span class="nm">3)</span><p>SHERETZ EGGS</p></div>
<div class="indent1"><span class="nm">(a)</span><p><span class="cl">(Mishnah):</span> A Sheretz egg in which a Sheretz formed is Tahor; if there is a hole of any size in the egg, it is Tamei. (In the following, "Achbar"refers to a species that spontaneously generates from earth.)</p></div>
<div class="indent1"><span class="nm">(b)</span><p>If an Achbar is half (developed into) flesh, and half (still) earth, one who touches the flesh is Tamei, one who touches the earth is Tahor.</p></div>
<div class="indent2"><span class="nm">1.</span><p>R. Yehudah says, even one who touches the earth opposite the flesh is Tamei.</p></div>
<div class="indent1"><span class="nm">(c)</span><p><span class="cl">(Gemara - Beraisa):</span> "Ha'Teme'im" includes the egg and femur of a Sheretz (they are Teme'im);</p></div>
<div class="indent2"><span class="nm">1.</span><p><span class="cl">Suggestion:</span> Perhaps the egg is Tamei even if (the inside) is unformed!</p></div>
<div class="indent2"><span class="nm">2.</span><p><span class="cl">Rejection:</span> "Ha'Sharetz" - just like the Sheretz is formed, also the egg.</p></div>
<div class="indent2"><span class="nm">3.</span><p><span class="cl">Suggestion:</span> Perhaps the egg is Tamei even if there is no hole!</p></div>
<div class="indent2"><span class="nm">4.</span><p><span class="cl">Rejection:</span> "One who touches will be Tamei" - it is Tamei only if the Tum'ah can be touched.</p></div>
<div class="indent1"><span class="nm">(d)</span><p><span class="cl">Question:</span> How big must the hole be?</p></div>
<div class="indent1"><span class="nm">(e)</span><p><span class="cl">Answer:</span> It must be as thick as a hair, in order that a hair could enter and touch the inside of the egg.</p></div>
<div class="subject"><span class="nm">4)</span><p>THE TUMAH OF ACHBARIM</p></div>
<div class="indent1"><span class="nm">(a)</span><p><span class="cl">Version #1 (Mishnah):</span> If an Achbar is half flesh... (one who touches the flesh becomes Tamei).</p></div>
<div class="indent1"><span class="nm">(b)</span><p><span class="cl">(R. Yehoshua ben Levi):</span> This is only if it has the full form of a Sheretz (on one side) from head to tail.</p></div>
<div class="indent1"><span class="nm">(c)</span><p><span class="cl">Version #2 (Mishnah - R. Yehudah):</span> Even one who touches the earth opposite the flesh is Tamei.</p></div>
<div class="indent1"><span class="nm">(d)</span><p><span class="cl">(R. Yehoshua ben Levi):</span> This is only if it has the full form of a Sheretz (on one side) from head to tail.</p></div>
<div class="indent2"><span class="nm">1.</span><p>Version #1 surely agrees to (the law of) Version #2. (Without the full form of a Sheretz, R. Yehudah would say that the earth is Metamei!)</p></div>
<div class="indent2"><span class="nm">2.</span><p>Version #2 argues with Version #1. (Chachamim say that the flesh is Metamei, even without the full form of a Sheretz.)</p></div>
<div class="indent1"><span class="nm">(e)</span><p><span class="cl">(Beraisa) Question:</span> The Torah is Metamei an "Achbar" (mouse). Perhaps this includes a sea mouse (a kind of fish), which is also called Achbar!</p></div>
<div class="indent1"><span class="nm">(f)</span><p><span class="cl">Answer #1:</span> Logic refutes this!</p></div>
<div class="indent2"><span class="nm">1.</span><p>A Chuldah (weasel) is Tamei, just like an Achbar. Just like a Chuldah is only on dry land, also an Achbar!</p></div>
<div class="indent1"><span class="nm">(g)</span><p><span class="cl">Objection:</span> We can learn oppositely!</p></div>
<div class="indent2"><span class="nm">1.</span><p>A Chuldah is Tamei, just like an Achbar. Just like everything called Chuldah is Tamei, also every Achbar, even a sea mouse!</p></div>
<div class="indent1"><span class="nm">(h)</span><p><span class="cl">Answer #2:</span> (It is Tamei only) "Al ha'Aretz".</p></div>
<div class="indent1"><span class="nm">(i)</span><p><span class="cl">Suggestion:</span> Perhaps this teaches that a mouse is Tamei only on the ground, but not at sea!</p></div>
