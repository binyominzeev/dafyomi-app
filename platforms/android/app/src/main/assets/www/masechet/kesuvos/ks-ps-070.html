<p class="bas indent1"><span class="nm">(a)</span><span class="cl">(Rav Chisda):</span> The Halachah is, whether or not he said 'only', we give them all they need.</p>
<p class="bas indent1"><span class="nm">(b)</span><span class="cl">Question:</span> The Halachah follows R. Meir, who says that it is a Mitzvah to fulfill the words of the deceased!</p>
<p class="bas indent1"><span class="nm">(c)</span><span class="cl">Answer:</span> That is in other cases. Here, the deceased wants his children to have their full needs. He said to give to them only a Shekel, merely so that they will be frugal.</p>
<p class="bas indent1"><span class="nm">(d)</span><span class="cl">(Mishnah):</span> If Pa'utos (mature children) buy or sell Metaltelim, it is valid.</p>
<p class="bas indent1"><span class="nm">(e)</span><span class="cl">(Rafram):</span> If they have an overseer, the sale is invalid. We learn this from the Seifa of our Mishnah, 'the actions of a minor are void'.</p>
<p class="bas indent1"><span class="nm">(f)</span><span class="cl">Question:</span> Perhaps this is only when there is a third party (who was told what to do with the property)!!</p>
<p class="bas indent1"><span class="nm">(g)</span><span class="cl">Answer:</span> If so, the Mishnah would have said 'but regarding a minor, David does like he was instructed;'</p>
<p class="bas indent2"><span class="nm">1.</span>'The actions of a minor are void' teaches that they are always void (when there is an overseer).</p>

<p class="bas subject"><span class="nm">2)</span>ONE WHO FORBIDS HIS WIFE THROUGH A VOW</p>
<p class="bas indent1"><span class="nm">(a)</span><span class="cl">(Mishnah):</span> If one vowed that his wife may not benefit from him, up to 30 days, he gets someone to finance her. Beyond this, he must divorce her and pay her Kesuvah.</p>
<p class="bas indent1"><span class="nm">(b)</span>R. Yehudah says, a Yisrael who vows thusly may keep his wife for one month, but (if he vowed) for two months he must divorce her and pay her Kesuvah;</p>
<p class="bas indent2"><span class="nm">1.</span>A Kohen (who cannot remarry her if he divorces her) keeps her two months, but for three months, he must divorce her and pay her Kesuvah.</p>
<p class="bas indent1"><span class="nm">(c)</span>If one forbade any type of produce to his wife through a vow, he divorces her and pays her Kesuvah;</p>
<p class="bas indent1"><span class="nm">(d)</span>R. Yehudah says, a Yisrael may keep her for one day, but for two days, he must divorce her and pay her Kesuvah. A Kohen keeps her two days, but for three days, he must divorce her and pay her Kesuvah.</p>
<p class="bas indent1"><span class="nm">(e)</span>If one forbade any type of cosmetics on his wife through a vow, he divorces her and pays her Kesuvah;</p>
<p class="bas indent1"><span class="nm">(f)</span>R. Yosi says, he divorces a poor woman if he did not limit the duration of the vow. For a rich woman, the Shi'ur is 30 days.</p>
<p class="bas indent1"><span class="nm">(g)</span><span class="cl">(Gemara) Question:</span> He is obligated to her! How can he uproot his obligation through a vow?!</p>
<p class="bas indent2"><span class="nm">1.</span><span class="cl">(Mishnah):</span> If a wife says 'What I produce is Konam to your mouth', her husband does not need to annul this.</p>
<p class="bas indent2"><span class="nm">2.</span>Since she is obligated to him, she cannot uproot her obligation.	Also here, he cannot uproot his obligation to feed her!</p>
<p class="bas indent1"><span class="nm">(h)</span><span class="cl">Answer #1:</span> Since he can say 'use your earnings to feed yourself', it is as if he said this.</p>
<p class="bas bbbline">70b----------------------------------------70b</p>
<p class="bas indent1"><span class="nm">(i)</span><span class="cl">Objection:</span> Rav Huna taught that a wife can tell her husband 'do not feed me and I will keep my earnings.'</p>
<p class="bas indent2"><span class="nm">1.</span>According to Rav Huna, when she says 'What I produce is Konam to your mouth', why doesn't he need to annul this? It should be as if she says 'do not feed me and I will keep my earnings!'</p>
<p class="bas indent1"><span class="nm">(j)</span><span class="cl">Answer #2:</span> Rather, he explicitly said 'use your earnings to feed yourself.'</p>
<p class="bas indent2"><span class="nm">1.</span><span class="cl">Question:</span> If so, why does he need someone to feed her?</p>
<p class="bas indent2"><span class="nm">2.</span><span class="cl">Answer:</span> Her earnings do not suffice to feed her.</p>
<p class="bas indent2"><span class="nm">3.</span><span class="cl">Objection:</span> If her earnings do not suffice, the question returns! (He must supply the deficit, so his vow should not take effect!)</p>
<p class="bas indent2"><span class="nm">4.</span><span class="cl">Answer (Rav Ashi):</span> Her earnings suffice for big things, but not for small things.</p>
<p class="bas indent2"><span class="nm">5.</span><span class="cl">Question:</span> What kind of small things are these?</p>
<p class="bas indent3"><span class="nm">i.</span>If she is used to them, he must supply them!</p>
<p class="bas indent3"><span class="nm">ii.</span>If she is not used to them, why must he have someone supply them to her?</p>
<p class="bas indent2"><span class="nm">6.</span><span class="cl">Answer:</span> She was used to them in her father's house, but not with her husband.</p>
<p class="bas indent3"><span class="nm">i.</span>She tells him 'Until now, with you, I could manage without them. Now that you vowed, I need them.'</p>
<p class="bas indent2"><span class="nm">7.</span><span class="cl">Question:</span> Why does someone else supply these things only for 30 days?</p>
<p class="bas indent2"><span class="nm">8.</span><span class="cl">Answer:</span> Until 30 days people do not know she is being supplied, so there is no disgrace. After 30 days people hear that she is being supplied, and she is disgraced.</p>
<p class="bas indent1"><span class="nm">(k)</span><span class="cl">Answer #3:</span> He vowed during Eirusin (before he was obligated to feed her).</p>
<p class="bas indent1"><span class="nm">(l)</span><span class="cl">Question:</span> If so, why must he have someone supply her needs? He has no obligation!</p>
<p class="bas indent1"><span class="nm">(m)</span><span class="cl">Answer:</span> The designated time for Chupah came, and he did not do Nisu'in.</p>
<p class="bas indent2"><span class="nm">1.</span><span class="cl">(Mishnah):</span> If the time came and they did not have Nisu'in, she eats his food, and (if he is a Kohen) she eats Terumah.</p>
<p class="bas indent2"><span class="nm">2.</span><span class="cl">Question:</span> Why does this apply only until 30 days?</p>
<p class="bas indent2"><span class="nm">3.</span><span class="cl">Answer:</span> A Shali'ach fulfills his mission for 30 days, but no longer.</p>
<p class="bas indent1"><span class="nm">(n)</span>Answer #4 He vowed during Eirusin, and then had Nisu'in.</p>
<p class="bas indent1"><span class="nm">(o)</span><span class="cl">Objection:</span> If she knew about the vow and did Nisu'in anyway, she accepted the vow! (Why must he divorce her and pay a Kesuvah?)</p>
<p class="bas indent1"><span class="nm">(p)</span><span class="cl">Answer:</span> She says 'I thought that I could endure it. Now I see that I cannot.'</p>
<p class="bas indent1"><span class="nm">(q)</span><span class="cl">Objection:</span> We say so only regarding Mumim. Would we say it regarding food?!</p>
<p class="bas indent1"><span class="nm">(r)</span><span class="cl">Conclusion:</span> Rather, we must answer like Answer #2 or Answer #3.</p>
<p class="bas subject"><span class="nm">3)</span>FEEDING ONE WHO MAY NOT GET BENEFIT</p>
<p class="bas indent1"><span class="nm">(a)</span><span class="cl">(Mishnah):</span> Until 30 days, he has someone feed her.</p>
<p class="bas indent1"><span class="nm">(b)</span><span class="cl">Question:</span> This person is like the husband's Shali'ach (agent! It should be forbidden, as if the husband himself is feeding her!)</p>
<p class="bas indent1"><span class="nm">(c)</span><span class="cl">Answer (Rav Huna):</span> He said 'whoever feeds her will not lose.'</p>
<p class="bas indent1"><span class="nm">(d)</span><span class="cl">Question:</span> Also this is like Shelichus!</p>
<p class="bas indent2"><span class="nm">1.</span><span class="cl">(Mishnah):</span> If someone cried from a pit 'whoever hears my voice should write a Get to my wife' people who hear this may write and give a Get.</p>
<p class="bas indent1"><span class="nm">(e)</span><span class="cl">Answer:</span> There is different, for he instructed (whoever hears him) to write. Here, he did not instruct to feed, he just said that whoever feeds will not lose.</p>
<p class="bas indent1"><span class="nm">(f)</span><span class="cl">Question:</span> R. Ami taught that regarding a fire (on Shabbos), one may say 'Whoever extinguishes will not lose.'</p>
<p class="bas indent2"><span class="nm">1.</span><span class="cl">Suggestion:</span> It is permitted regarding a fire, but not in our case!</p>
<p class="bas indent1"><span class="nm">(g)</span><span class="cl">Answer:</span> No, it is permitted regarding a fire, but not regarding other Isurim of Shabbos.</p>
<p class="bas indent1"><span class="nm">(h)</span><span class="cl">Question (Rabah - Mishnah):</span> If Reuven is Mudar Hana'ah (forbidden by a vow from benefiting) from Shimon, and lacks food, Shimon may tell a grocer he frequents 'Reuven cannot get benefit from me. I don't know what to do for him'!</p>
<p class="bas indent2"><span class="nm">1.</span>The grocer gives to Reuven, and collects the money from Shimon.</p>
<p class="bas indent2"><span class="nm">2.</span><span class="cl">Suggestion:</span> This is allowed, but not saying "Anyone who feeds..."!</p>
<p class="bas indent1"><span class="nm">(i)</span><span class="cl">Answer:</span> No, also this is allowed. The Mishnah teaches a greater Chidush;</p>
<p class="bas indent2"><span class="nm">1.</span>Not only "whoever feeds..." is allowed, in which he does not address a particular person. In the Mishnah he is frequent by the grocer, and he tells him his plight- It is as if he tells him to feed him, and still, it is allowed!</p>
<p class="bas indent1"><span class="nm">(j)</span><span class="cl">(Mishnah):</span> If Reuven is Mudar Hana'ah from Shimon and lacks food, Shimon may tell a grocer he frequents 'Reuven cannot get benefit from me. I don't know what to do for him'!</p>
<p class="bas indent2"><span class="nm">1.</span>The grocer gives to Reuven, and collects the money from Shimon.</p>
<p class="bas indent1"><span class="nm">(k)</span>If Reuven needed to build his house or a fence, or harvest his field, Shimon tells workers 'Reuven cannot get benefit from me. I don't know what to do for him'.</p>
<p class="bas indent2"><span class="nm">1.</span>The workers work for Reuven, and collect their wages from Shimon.</p>
<p class="bas indent1"><span class="nm">(l)</span>If they were walking on the road and Reuven lacks food, Shimon gives a gift to David, and Reuven may take from David;</p>
<p class="bas indent2"><span class="nm">1.</span>If no one else is there, Shimon puts the food on a rock or fence and says "It is Hefker for whoever would like it." Reuven may take it and eat it;</p>
<p class="bas indent2"><span class="nm">2.</span>R. Yosi forbids.</p>
<p class="bas indent1"><span class="nm">(m)</span><span class="cl">(Rava):</span> R. Yosi forbids due to a gift like the case in Beis Choron (someone gave a 'gift' to evade the Isur of a Mudar Hana'ah, but he did not truly intend that it is a gift).</p>
