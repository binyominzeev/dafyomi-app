<div class="subject"><span class="nm">1)</span><p>SHIURIM</p></div>
<div class="indent1"><span class="nm">(a)</span><p>All food Shi'urim are a k'Zayis except <i>Tum'as</i> Ochlin (which is a k'Beitzah).</p></div>
<div class="indent1"><span class="nm">(b)</span><p>This exception is owing to the change of Lashon applied by the Pasuk.</p></div>
<div class="indent2"><span class="nm">1.</span><p>A confirmation of this may be drawn from Yom Kipur.</p></div>
<div class="indent2"><span class="nm">2.</span><p><span class="cl">Question:</span> What change of Lashon  does the Pasuk use by Yom Kipur?</p></div>
<div class="indent2"><span class="nm">3.</span><p><span class="cl">Answer:</span> "Asher Lo Se'uneh" in place of "Asher Tochal".</p></div>
<div class="indent2"><span class="nm">4.</span><p><span class="cl">Question:</span> What differentiation do we make by Yom Kipur?</p></div>
<div class="indent2"><span class="nm">5.</span><p><span class="cl">Answer:</span> The Shi'ur is ke'Koseves.</p></div>
<div class="indent2"><span class="nm">6.</span><p><span class="cl">Question:</span> Why do we need confirmation from Yom Kipur?</p></div>
<div class="indent2"><span class="nm">7.</span><p><span class="cl">Answer:</span> We might otherwise attribute the change by <i>Tum'as</i> Ochlin to usage (syntax).</p></div>
<div class="indent1"><span class="nm">(c)</span><p><span class="cl">Question:</span> How do we know that <i>Tum'as</i> Ochlin is a k'Beitzah?</p></div>
<div class="indent1"><span class="nm">(d)</span><p><span class="cl">Answer (R. Avahu citing R. Elazar):</span> The Pasuk implies food which derives from food, i.e. a chicken-egg.</p></div>
<div class="indent2"><span class="nm">1.</span><p><span class="cl">Question:</span> Perhaps it means a kid-goat?</p></div>
<div class="indent2"><span class="nm">2.</span><p><span class="cl">Answer:</span> A kid-goat would not be called 'Ochel', since it still requires Shechitah.</p></div>
<div class="indent2"><span class="nm">3.</span><p><span class="cl">Question:</span> Perhaps the kid is a Ben Peku'ah?</p></div>
<div class="indent2"><span class="nm">4.</span><p><span class="cl">Answer:</span> It still requires Keri'ah.</p></div>
<div class="indent2"><span class="nm">5.</span><p><span class="cl">Question:</span> Perhaps the Pasuk refers to the egg of a large bird.</p></div>
<div class="indent2"><span class="nm">6.</span><p><span class="cl">Answer:</span> We apply the rule of minimum Chidush ('Tafasta ... ').</p></div>
<div class="indent2"><span class="nm">7.</span><p><span class="cl">Question:</span> Then we should use the egg of the smallest bird!?</p></div>
<div class="indent1"><span class="nm">(e)</span><p><span class="cl">Answer (R. Avahu himself):</span> The Pasuk implies the most food which may be swallowed at one time, which Chazal assessed to be the volume of a chicken's egg.</p></div>
<div class="subject"><span class="nm">2)</span><p>CHANGES IN SHIURIM</p></div>
<div class="indent1"><span class="nm">(a)</span><p><span class="cl">(R. Elazar):</span> One who eats Cheilev nowadays must record for himself the amount consumed, in case a future Beis Din will increase the Shiurim.</p></div>
<div class="indent1"><span class="nm">(b)</span><p><span class="cl">Question:</span> What is meant by 'Yarbeh be'Shiurin'?</p></div>
<div class="indent1"><span class="nm">(c)</span><p><span class="cl">Answer:</span> The Beis Din will obligate a Korban for a <i>smaller</i> k'Zayis.</p></div>
<div class="indent1"><span class="nm">(d)</span><p><span class="cl">Question:</span> But then he will not have to bring a Korban, given the rule that a Chatas is only brought if one repents when he discovers that what he did not previously know!?</p></div>
<div class="indent1"><span class="nm">(e)</span><p><span class="cl">Answer:</span> Rather, the Beis Din will obligate a Korban only for a <i>larger</i> k'Zayis.</p></div>
<div class="indent1"><span class="nm">(f)</span><p><span class="cl">Question:</span> How could we have thought (in (c) above) that <i>Yarbeh</i> be'Shiurin might refer to their determining a <i>smaller</i> Shiur!?</p></div>
<div class="indent1"><span class="nm">(g)</span><p><span class="cl">Answer:</span> The 'Yarbeh' refers to the increased number of Korbanos which he would thus be obligated to bring.</p></div>
<div class="subject"><span class="nm">3)</span><p>SHIURIM HALACHAH L'MOSHE MISINAI</p></div>
<div class="indent1"><span class="nm">(a)</span><p><span class="cl">(R. Yochanan):</span> Shiurim and their Onshin are Halachah le'Moshe mi'Sinai.</p></div>
<div class="indent1"><span class="nm">(b)</span><p><span class="cl">Question:</span> But the Onshin are written in the Torah!?</p></div>
<div class="indent1"><span class="nm">(c)</span><p><span class="cl">Answer:</span> We mean the Shi'urim for incurring the Onshin (as supported by the Beraisa).</p></div>
<div class="indent1"><span class="nm">(d)</span><p><span class="cl">(Acheirim):</span> The Shiurim for Onshin were established by the Beis Din of Osniel b. K'naz (Ya'avetz).</p></div>
<div class="indent1"><span class="nm">(e)</span><p><span class="cl">Question:</span> But no one is permitted to introduce a Chidush!?</p></div>
<div class="indent1"><span class="nm">(f)</span><p><span class="cl">Answer:</span> They had been forgotten and he restored them.</p></div>
<div class="subject"><span class="nm">4)</span><p>DRINKING A M'LO LUGMAV (MOUTHFUL)</p></div>
<div class="indent1"><span class="nm">(a)</span><p><span class="cl">(R. Yehudah citing Shmuel):</span> We do not mean a true mouthful, but rather the amount which, if placed to one side of the mouth, will create the appearance of a mouth-full.</p></div>
<div class="indent1"><span class="nm">(b)</span><p><span class="cl">Question:</span> But the Mishnah speaks of a mouthful ('M'lo Lugmav' [plural]which presumably is to be understood literally)!?</p></div>
<div class="indent1"><span class="nm">(c)</span><p><span class="cl">Answer:</span> Understand it as <i>ki'</i>M'lo Lugmav.</p></div>
<div class="indent1"><span class="nm">(d)</span><p><span class="cl">Question:</span> But we find the in the Beraisa the words 'M'lo Lugmav' to be literally a mouthful (as distinct from the opinion there 'ki'Melo Lugmav')?</p></div>
<div class="indent1"><span class="nm">(e)</span><p><span class="cl">Answer:</span> The Beraisa is <i>also</i> to be understood as 'ki'Melo Lugmav'!</p></div>
<div class="indent1"><span class="nm">(f)</span><p><span class="cl">Question:</span> Then how is Beis Hillel (M'lo Lugmav) distinct from R. Eliezer (ki'Melo Lugmav)?</p></div>
<div class="indent1"><span class="nm">(g)</span><p><span class="cl">Answer:</span> Whether we mean the appearance of a cheekful without pressure (Beis Hillel) while R. Eliezer would not make the person Chayav until he drank a tight cheekful.</p></div>
<div class="indent1"><span class="nm">(h)</span><p><span class="cl">Question:</span> If so, this should have been listed as one of the Kulos of Beis Shamai relative to Beis Hillel (since Beis Shamai obligates for a Revi'is and the relaxed cheekful of Beis Hillel is smaller) in Idayos!?</p></div>
<div class="bbbline">80b----------------------------------------80b</p></div>
<div class="indent1"><span class="nm">(i)</span><p><span class="cl">Answer:</span> The question was asked regarding a giant person, such that Beis Shamai is Machmir there.</p></div>
<div class="indent1"><span class="nm">(j)</span><p><span class="cl">Question (the following three exchanges are between R. Zeira and Abaye):</span> Why should we distinguish regarding liquids between individuals of different sizes, where we do not find such distinctions regarding food?</p></div>
<div class="indent1"><span class="nm">(k)</span><p><span class="cl">Answer:</span> Chazal understood that a Koseves of food brings every person to a state of calm, whereas people vary regarding the amount of drink which brings calm.</p></div>
<div class="indent1"><span class="nm">(l)</span><p><span class="cl">Question:</span> Could it be that <i>every</i> person is calmed with a ke'Koseves, even a giant?</p></div>
<div class="indent1"><span class="nm">(m)</span><p><span class="cl">Answer:</span> Everybody is eased (from a moment of <i>Inuy</i>, and thus is Chayav) from a ke'Koseves, to a greater or lesser degree.</p></div>
<div class="indent1"><span class="nm">(n)</span><p><span class="cl">Question:</span> How can we not differentiate between a Koseves of heavy, satisfying foods (meat) and foods with much less nutritional value (Lulvei Gefanim)?</p></div>
<div class="indent1"><span class="nm">(o)</span><p><span class="cl">Answer:</span> Again, these will bring to differing levels of calm, but both will negate the <i>Inuy</i> of Yom Kipur.</p></div>
<div class="indent1"><span class="nm">(p)</span><p><span class="cl">Question (Rava):</span> You have created a Kula in Yom Kipur by using the time frame for a k'Zayis (bi'Chedei Achilas P'ras) and applying it to a Koseves (such that a Koseves eaten in slightly more than bi'Chedei Achilas P'ras would be Patur)!?</p></div>
<div class="indent1"><span class="nm">(q)</span><p><span class="cl">Answer (Abaye):</span> Chazal assessed that food eaten during this time frame calms, whereas more time does not bring calm.</p></div>
<div class="subject"><span class="nm">5)</span><p>ACHILAS PERAS</p></div>
<div class="indent1"><span class="nm">(a)</span><p><span class="cl">Question (Rava):</span> Chazal have created a Kula by <i>Tum'as</i> Ochlin in that a k'Zayis eaten bi'Chedei Achilas P'ras is considered Achilah, and yet to create <i>Tum'ah</i> in the body of the person (<i>Tum'as</i> Geviyah), it would take half a P'ras eaten in the same time frame (it is thus much harder to become Tamei)!</p></div>
<div class="indent1"><span class="nm">(b)</span><p><span class="cl">Answer (R. Papa):</span> The Kula is because <i>Tum'as</i> Geviyah is de'Rabanan.</p></div>
<div class="indent1"><span class="nm">(c)</span><p><span class="cl">Question:</span> But we find that R. Papa holds that <i>Tum'as</i> Geviyah is d'Oreisa!?</p></div>
<div class="indent1"><span class="nm">(d)</span><p><span class="cl">Answer:</span> It is de'Rabanan, and the Pasuk is an Asmachta.</p></div>
<div class="subject"><span class="nm">6)</span><p>TZIRUF - FOODS COMBINING TO A SHIUR</p></div>
<div class="indent1"><span class="nm">(a)</span><p><span class="cl">(R. Papa):</span> Umtza and its salt combine to make up a ke'Koseves.</p></div>
<div class="indent1"><span class="nm">(b)</span><p>This is true even though salt is not eaten, but since it is normally eaten on the raw meat, it is Mitztaref.</p></div>
<div class="indent1"><span class="nm">(c)</span><p><span class="cl">(Resh Lakish):</span> Tzir combines with the vegetables on which it is found.</p></div>
<div class="indent1"><span class="nm">(d)</span><p><span class="cl">Question:</span> Of course!?</p></div>
<div class="indent1"><span class="nm">(e)</span><p><span class="cl">Answer:</span> We might have considered the Tzir as a liquid (which does not combine with food), and now we are taught that anything which renders a food more edible, combines with it.</p></div>
<div class="subject"><span class="nm">7)</span><p>ACHILAH GASAH ON YOM KIPUR</p></div>
<div class="indent1"><span class="nm">(a)</span><p><span class="cl">(Resh Lakish):</span> One who eats Achilah Gasah is Patur.</p></div>
<div class="indent1"><span class="nm">(b)</span><p><span class="cl">Question:</span> Why is this so?</p></div>
<div class="indent1"><span class="nm">(c)</span><p><span class="cl">Answer:</span> Because one who is harming himself with his eating has not negated the dictate of "Lo Se'uneh".</p></div>
<div class="indent1"><span class="nm">(d)</span><p>Similarly, a non-Kohen who eats Terumah as Achilah Gasah pays the principle but not the Chomesh, since the Pasuk makes one liable for eating the Terumah, not for damaging oneself with it.</p></div>
