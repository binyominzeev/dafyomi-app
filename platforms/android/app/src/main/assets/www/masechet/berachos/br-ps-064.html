<p class="bas subject"><span class="nm">1)</span>ATTRIBUTES AND REWARDS OF CHACHAMIM</p>
<p class="bas indent1"><span class="nm">(a)</span><span class="cl">(R. Avin ha'Levi):</span> Whoever makes excessive efforts to attain wealth or grandeur will not attain it;</p>
<p class="bas indent2"><span class="nm">1.</span>Anyone who does not receive now what he was entitled to will receive it later -- we learn from Rabah and Rav Yosef.</p>
<p class="bas indent2"><span class="nm">2.</span>Rav Yosef was [one who knows all the Mishnayos and Beraisos, as they were given on] Sinai, Rabah uprooted mountains (through his sharp power of reasoning). [After Rav Yehudah died in Pumbedisa,] they needed one of them to be Rosh Yeshivah -- they asked Chachamim of Eretz Yisrael which takes precedence.</p>
<p class="bas indent2"><span class="nm">3.</span><span class="cl">(Chachamim of Eretz Yisrael):</span> Sinai comes first -- all need the bearer of wheat (Mishnayos and Beraisos are the source of all Halachah)!</p>
<p class="bas indent2"><span class="nm">4.</span>Even so, Rav Yosef did not accept, for astrologers had told him that he would reign for two years (and, presumably, he would die after this).</p>
<p class="bas indent2"><span class="nm">5.</span>(Rashba (Teshuvos attributed to Ramban, #283) permits following astrology, and questions whether one may go against it and rely on a miracle to be saved. Rambam (Hilchos Avodah Zarah 11-9) forbids astrology (among other "follies") -- it is not clear how he explains Rav Yosef and other Chachamim who were concerned for it.)</p>
<p class="bas indent2"><span class="nm">6.</span>Rabah reigned for 22 years; he died, and Rav Yosef ruled for two and a half years. During the 22 years, Rav Yosef did not call a blood-letter to his house (Rashi - to avoid any conduct of authority; Ramah - he had no need for any doctors, this was a reward for humbling himself).</p>
<p class="bas indent1"><span class="nm">(b)</span><span class="cl">Question (R. Avin ha'Levi):</span> Why does it say, "Ya'ancha Hash-m b'Yom Tzarah Yesagevcha Shem Elokei <i>Yakov</i>," as opposed to Elokei Avraham or Yitzchak?</p>
<p class="bas indent1"><span class="nm">(c)</span><span class="cl">Answer:</span> This teaches that [when people carry a beam together,] the owner should hold the beam in the middle (to bear the brunt of its weight -- Yakov had the greatest toil raising the 12 tribes, he is most qualified to request mercy for Yisrael).</p>
<p class="bas indent1"><span class="nm">(d)</span><span class="cl">(R. Avin ha'Levi):</span> Whoever benefits from a meal with a Chacham is considered to have enjoyed the radiance of the Shechinah -- "va'Yavo Aharon v'Chol Ziknei Yisrael le'Echol Lechem Im Chosen Moshe Lifnei Elokim";</p>
<p class="bas indent2"><span class="nm">1.</span><span class="cl">Question:</span> They were in front of Moshe, not in front of Hash-m!</p>
<p class="bas indent2"><span class="nm">2.</span><span class="cl">Answer:</span> This teaches that it is as if they enjoyed the radiance of the Shechinah.</p>
<p class="bas indent1"><span class="nm">(e)</span><span class="cl">(R. Avin ha'Levi):</span> One who takes leave of his friend should not say, "Lech b'Shalom," but rather, "Lech l'Shalom";</p>
<p class="bas indent1"><span class="nm">(f)</span>Yisro said to Moshe "Lech l'Shalom," and Moshe succeeded; David told Avshalom "Lech b'Shalom," and Avshalom was hung (by his hair and killed).</p>
<p class="bas indent1"><span class="nm">(g)</span><span class="cl">(R. Avin ha'Levi):</span> One who takes leave of a corpse [after accompanying it on the way to burial] should not say "Lech l'Shalom," but rather, "Lech b'Shalom," as Hash-m said to Avraham, "v'Atah Tavo El Avosecha b'Shalom."</p>
<p class="bas indent1"><span class="nm">(h)</span><span class="cl">(R. Levi bar Chiya):</span> If one leaves synagogue and goes to the study hall to learn Torah, he merits to greet the Shechinah -- "Yelchu me'Chayil El Chayil Yera'eh El Elokim b'Tziyon."</p>
<p class="bas indent1"><span class="nm">(i)</span><span class="cl">(R. Chiya bar Ashi):</span> The verse teaches that Chachamim have no rest (ha'Kosev in Ein Yakov - cessation from learning) in this world nor in the next.</p>
<p class="bas indent1"><span class="nm">(j)</span><span class="cl">(R. Elazar):</span> Chachamim increase Shalom in the world -- "v'Chol Banayich Limudei Hash-m v'Rav Shelom <i>Banayich</i>" -- we read this as "Bonayich" (your builders);</p>
<p class="bas indent2"><span class="nm">1.</span>It also says, "Shalom Rav l'Ohavei Sorasecha v'Ein Lamo Michshol" (Tzelach - when there is peace among Chachamim, they learn together and are saved from mistakes);</p>
<p class="bas indent2"><span class="nm">2.</span>"Yehi Shalom b'Chelech Shalvah b'Armenosayich";</p>
<p class="bas indent2"><span class="nm">3.</span>"Lema'an Achai v'Re'ai Adabrah Na Shalom Bach Lema'an Beis Hash-m Elokeinu Avakshah Tov Lach";</p>
<p class="bas indent2"><span class="nm">4.</span>"Hash-m Oz l'Amo Yiten Hash-m Yevarech Es Amo va'Shalom."</p>
