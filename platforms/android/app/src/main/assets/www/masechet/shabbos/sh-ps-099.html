<p class="dedicationbox">SHABBOS 99 - Two weeks of study material have been dedicated by Mrs. Estanne Abraham Fawer to honor the thirteenth Yahrzeit of her father, Rav Mordechai ben Eliezer Zvi (Rabbi Morton Weiner) Z'L, who passed away on 18 Teves 5760. May the merit of supporting and advancing Dafyomi study -- which was so important to him -- during the weeks of his Yahrzeit serve as an Iluy for his Neshamah. </p>

<p class="bas subject"><span class="nm">1)</span>THE <i>CHOCHMAH</i> USED TO MAKE THE CURTAINS</p>
<p class="bas indent1"><span class="nm">(a)</span><span class="cl">(Beraisa):</span> The Kerashim were grooved (most of the bottom Amah was cut out, only two pegs stuck out, which fit into the Adanim); the Adanim were hollow (each had a hole for a peg of a Keresh); the clasps joining the loops [at the end of each set of five lower curtains] could be seen, like stars.</p>
<p class="bas indent1"><span class="nm">(b)</span><span class="cl">(Beraisa):</span> The lower curtains were of [dyed wool of three colors,] Techeiles, Argamon (purple), Tola'as Shani (crimson) and linen;</p>
<p class="bas indent1"><span class="nm">(c)</span>The upper curtains were of goats' hair;</p>
<p class="bas indent1"><span class="nm">(d)</span>The Chachmah used to make the upper curtains exceeded that used for the lower curtains:</p>
<p class="bas indent2"><span class="nm">1.</span>Regarding the lower curtains it says "V'Chol Ishah Chachmas Lev b'Yadeha Tavu";</p>
<p class="bas indent2"><span class="nm">2.</span>Regarding the upper curtains it says "V'Chol ha'Nashim Asher Nasa Liban Osana b'Chachmah Tavu Es ha'Izim";</p>
<p class="bas indent2"><span class="nm">3.</span><span class="cl">(Beraisa - R. Nechemyah):</span> They washed [the hair while it was still] on the goats and they spun on the goats.</p>
<p class="bas subject"><span class="nm">2)</span>THE WIDTH OF THE WAGONS</p>
<p class="bas indent1"><span class="nm">(a)</span><span class="cl">(Mishnah):</span> If two ledges...</p>
<p class="bas indent1"><span class="nm">(b)</span><span class="cl">(Rav):</span> The wagons, underneath them, between them and to the sides of them were Reshus ha'Rabim.</p>
<p class="bas indent1"><span class="nm">(c)</span><span class="cl">(Abaye):</span> The distance between wagons (side by side) was equal to the length of the wagons.</p>
<p class="bas indent1"><span class="nm">(d)</span><span class="cl">Question:</span> What was the length of the wagons?</p>
<p class="bas indent1"><span class="nm">(e)</span><span class="cl">Answer:</span> It was five Amos.</p>
<p class="bas indent1"><span class="nm">(f)</span><span class="cl">Question:</span> Four and a half Amos would have sufficed! (Tosfos - the boards lay on their thickness (one Amah); only four fit across, for we must allow room for the rings, which point to the side - still, four and a half Amos would suffice. Rashi - alternatively, if they lie on their width (one and a half Amos), three fit across; they occupy only four and a half Amos (the rings point up or down).</p>
<p class="bas indent1"><span class="nm">(g)</span><span class="cl">Answer:</span> We do not want to force the boards to fit exactly (Rashi - i.e. lay them on their width; Tosfos - we want to leave extra room, so they will not press on each other).</p>
<p class="bas indent1"><span class="nm">(h)</span><span class="cl">(Rava):</span> The sides of the wagons (the thickness of the wheel and the distance of the wheel from the interior of the wagon; Rashi - and the thickness of the wall) was equal to the width of the wagons.</p>
<p class="bas indent1"><span class="nm">(i)</span><span class="cl">Question:</span> What was the width of the wagons?</p>
<p class="bas indent1"><span class="nm">(j)</span><span class="cl">Answer:</span> It was two and a half Amos. (Rashi - both sides together equaled two and a half; Tosfos - each side was two and a half.)</p>
<p class="bas indent1"><span class="nm">(k)</span><span class="cl">Question:</span> One and a half Amos would have sufficed (to hold the ends (Tosfos; Rashi - middle) of the boards, and they could have balanced)!</p>
<p class="bas indent1"><span class="nm">(l)</span><span class="cl">Answer:</span> They were two and a half in order that the boards would not tilt to the side.</p>
<p class="bas indent1"><span class="nm">(m)</span><span class="cl">Question:</span> We learn from the Mishkan that Reshus ha'Rabim is 16 Amos wide - the wagons occupied only 15 Amos across! (There were five Amos between wagons, each wagon was five Amos including its two sides (Rashi; Tosfos - including its outer side - the two inner sides comprised the five Amos between wagons).)</p>
<p class="bas indent1"><span class="nm">(n)</span><span class="cl">Answer:</span> There was an extra Amah for a Levi to walk to the side, to fix the boards if they were about to fall into the Amah between the piles. (Rashi - there was a half-Amah for a Levi on each side; Tosfos - there was a full Amah for one Levi on one side.)</p>
<p class="bas subject"><span class="nm">3)</span>PUTTING SOMETHING ON <i>CHULYAS HA'BOR</i></p>
<p class="bas indent1"><span class="nm">(a)</span><span class="cl">(Mishnah):</span> If a Chulyas ha'Bor (a ring of dirt dug out from a pit) or a rock is 10 tall and four wide [it is Reshus ha'Yachid], and one takes an object from it or puts on it, he is liable;</p>
<p class="bas indent2"><span class="nm">1.</span>If it is less than 10 by four, he is exempt.</p>
<p class="bas indent1"><span class="nm">(b)</span><span class="cl">(Gemara) Question:</span> [We learn about taking from an elevated place from the case of the rock, surely, Chulyas ha'Bor teaches about a pit -] why didn't the Tana directly say, a pit or a rock...?</p>
<p class="bas indent1"><span class="nm">(c)</span><span class="cl">Answer:</span> This [teaches like, and thereby] supports R. Yochanan:</p>
<p class="bas indent2"><span class="nm">1.</span><span class="cl">1.	(R. Yochanan):</span> [The depression of] a pit and [the height of] its Chulyah join with each other to complete the Shi'ur of 10 [to make the pit a Reshus ha'Yachid].</p>
<p class="bas indent1"><span class="nm">(d)</span><span class="cl">Support (Beraisa):</span> If a pit in Reshus ha'Rabim is 10 deep and four wide, one may not fill a jug with water from it on Shabbos, unless there is a wall around it 10 tall;</p>
<p class="bas bbbline">99b----------------------------------------99b</p>
<p class="bas indent1"><span class="nm">(e)</span>One may not drink from it unless he sticks in his head and majority [of his body into the pit];</p>
<p class="bas indent1"><span class="nm">(f)</span>A pit and its Chulyah join for the Shi'ur of 10.</p>
<p class="bas indent1"><span class="nm">(g)</span><span class="cl">Question (Rav Mordechai):</span> If a pillar in Reshus ha'Rabim is 10 tall and four wide, and one threw something and it landed on it, what is the law?</p>
<p class="bas indent2"><span class="nm">1.</span>Since Akirah and Hanachah were both from Makom Isur (a place where Hotza'ah or Hachnasah is forbidden, e.g. Reshus ha'Rabim or Reshus ha'Yachid), he is liable;</p>
<p class="bas indent2"><span class="nm">2.</span>Or, since it passed through Makom Patur (it was above 10 before it landed), he is exempt?</p>
<p class="bas indent1"><span class="nm">(h)</span><span class="cl">Answer (Rabah):</span> We learn from our Mishnah!</p>
<p class="bas indent1"><span class="nm">(i)</span>Rav Mordechai asked Rav Yosef, and then Abaye; both gave him the same answer.</p>
<p class="bas indent1"><span class="nm">(j)</span><span class="cl">Rav Mordechai:</span> You all give the same inadequate answer!</p>
<p class="bas indent1"><span class="nm">(k)</span><span class="cl">Abaye:</span> Surely you agree - the Mishnah says, if one takes an object from it or puts on it, he is liable [even though it passed through Makom Patur]!</p>
<p class="bas indent1"><span class="nm">(l)</span><span class="cl">Rejection (Rav Mordechai):</span> Perhaps the Mishnah discusses a needle (it was never above 10).</p>
<p class="bas indent1"><span class="nm">(m)</span><span class="cl">Question:</span> Even a needle [has some thickness, hence it] had to be a bit above 10!</p>
<p class="bas indent1"><span class="nm">(n)</span><span class="cl">Answer #1:</span> The rock has a small hole [below 10] into which the needle was inserted (a small hole in Reshus ha'Yachid is like Reshus ha'Yachid).</p>
<p class="bas indent1"><span class="nm">(o)</span><span class="cl">Answer #2:</span> The rock has a crack [at the top] into which the needle was inserted.</p>
<p class="bas subject"><span class="nm">4)</span>SOMETHING THAT CHANGED STATUS ON SHABBOS</p>
<p class="bas indent1"><span class="nm">(a)</span><span class="cl">Question (Rav Meisha citing R. Yochanan):</span> If there was a Karmelis in Reshus ha'Rabim, and one surrounded it with a wall 10 tall but less than four wide, making it Reshus ha'Yachid, and one threw something and it landed on the wall, what is the law?</p>
<p class="bas indent2"><span class="nm">1.</span>Since it is not four wide, it is Makom Patur;</p>
<p class="bas indent2"><span class="nm">2.</span>Or, since it made a Reshus ha'Yachid, it is as if the interior is full [up to 10 Tefachim, so the wall is also Reshus ha'Yachid]?</p>
<p class="bas indent1"><span class="nm">(b)</span><span class="cl">Answer (Ula):</span> Since it is a Mechitzah [by itself], and it makes something else Reshus ha'Yachid, all the more so it itself is Reshus ha'Yachid!</p>
<p class="bas indent1"><span class="nm">(c)</span>Ula's Halachah was also taught by Rav, and by R. Yitzchak in the name of R. Yochanan.</p>
<p class="bas indent1"><span class="nm">(d)</span><span class="cl">Question #1 (R. Yochanan):</span> If there was a pit in Reshus ha'Rabim nine deep, and one removed dirt, completing it to 10, and deposited the dirt in Reshus ha'Rabim, what is the law?</p>
<p class="bas indent2"><span class="nm">1.</span>If it becomes Reshus ha'Yachid at the very moment he uproots the dirt, he is liable;</p>
<p class="bas indent2"><span class="nm">2.</span>Or, perhaps [it is not Reshus ha'Yachid until after the dirt is removed, so] he is exempt?</p>
<p class="bas indent1"><span class="nm">(e)</span><span class="cl">Question #2 (R. Yochanan):</span> If you will say that since it was not Reshus ha'Yachid from the beginning he is exempt, what if the pit was 10 deep, and he threw in dirt, making it less than 10?</p>
<p class="bas indent2"><span class="nm">1.</span>It ceases to be Reshus ha'Yachid at the time of Hanachah - is he liable in such a case?</p>
<p class="bas indent1"><span class="nm">(f)</span><span class="cl">Suggestion:</span> We can answer this from another teaching of R. Yochanan!</p>
<p class="bas indent2"><span class="nm">1.</span><span class="cl">(Mishnah):</span> If one threw something four Amos at a wall, if this was above 10, he is [exempt] like one who threw in the air. If this was below 10, he is like one who threw on the ground. One who threw four Amos on the ground is liable.</p>
<p class="bas indent2"><span class="nm">2.</span><span class="cl">Question:</span> When it was below 10, why is he liable - there was no Hanachah [outside of four Amos, for it bounces back]!</p>
<p class="bas indent2"><span class="nm">3.</span><span class="cl">Answer (R. Yochanan):</span> The case is, he threw a fat fig-cake [it stuck to the wall].</p>
<p class="bas indent2"><span class="nm">4.</span><span class="cl">Version #1 (Rashi) Question:</span> The thickness of the fig-cake itself should be deducted from four Amos! (Rather, we must say that he is liable because at the beginning [when he threw] there were four Amos until the wall, even though they were diminished at the time of Hanachah.)</p>
<p class="bas indent2"><span class="nm">5.</span><span class="cl">Version #2 (Tosfos) Question:</span> The thickness of the cake itself is Batul to the wall, that place loses the law of [Reshus ha'Rabim, to Mechayev one who throws at it] four Amos! (Rather, even though at the end it is not Reshus ha'Rabim, he is liable because when he threw it was Reshus ha'Rabim; (end of Version #2)</p>
<p class="bas indent3"><span class="nm">i.</span>Likewise, regarding the pit he should be liable!</p>
<p class="bas indent1"><span class="nm">(g)</span><span class="cl">Rejection:</span> No - here, he will not leave the cake there, therefore it is not Batul;</p>
<p class="bas indent2"><span class="nm">1.</span>Regarding the pit he will Mevatel the dirt (therefore, perhaps he is exempt).</p>
<p class="bas indent1"><span class="nm">(h)</span><span class="cl">Question (Rava):</span> If one threw a board and it landed on pegs, what is the law? (Tosfos - there are already two walls, after it lands it is considered as if there is another Mechitzah on account of Pi Tikra Yored v'Sosem (it is as if the edge of the board extends down to the ground to make a Mechitzah).)</p>
<p class="bas indent2"><span class="nm">1.</span><span class="cl">Question:</span> What does he ask about?</p>
<p class="bas indent2"><span class="nm">2.</span><span class="cl">Answer #1:</span> He asks about when a Mechitzah is made at the time of Hanachah.</p>
<p class="bas indent2"><span class="nm">3.</span><span class="cl">Objection:</span> That was R. Yochanan's question!</p>
<p class="bas indent2"><span class="nm">4.</span><span class="cl">Answer #2:</span> Rava asks about throwing a board with an object on it. (If you will say that in R. Yochanan's case he is exempt because the Mechitzah was not there from the beginning, likewise here he is exempt for the board - is he liable for the object?)</p>
<p class="bas indent3"><span class="nm">i.</span>Since the Mechitzah is made at the time of Hanachah, he is exempt;</p>
<p class="bas indent3"><span class="nm">ii.</span>Or, since the board lands a bit before the object, the Mechitzah preceded Hanachah, he is liable!</p>
<p class="bas indent1"><span class="nm">(i)</span>This question is not resolved.</p>
