<p class="bas indent1"><span class="nm">(a)</span><span class="cl">(Mishnah):</span> If the Great Sanhedrin (which is simply called Beis Din in this Masechta) (mistakenly) gave a Hora'ah (a ruling) to transgress a Mitzvah (punishable by Kares for one who was Mezid):</p>
<p class="bas indent2"><span class="nm">1.</span>If an individual relied on Beis Din and transgressed (b'Shogeg), whether he transgressed with them, or after them, or even if Beis Din themselves did not transgress, he is exempt, because he relied on Beis Din.</p>
<p class="bas indent2"><span class="nm">2.</span>If a member of the Beis Din or a Chacham qualified to give Hora'ah knew that Beis Din erred, and transgressed, whether he transgressed with them, after them, or without them, he is liable (brings a Korban), because he did not rely on Beis Din.</p>
<p class="bas indent2"><span class="nm">3.</span>The general rule is, one who relies on himself is liable. One who relies on Beis Din is exempt.</p>
<p class="bas indent1"><span class="nm">(b)</span><span class="cl">Version #1 (Gemara - Shmuel):</span> Beis Din brings Par He'elam Davar (a bull to atone for a mistaken Hora'ah that caused the majority of Yisrael to transgress) only if Beis Din said 'you are permitted.' <span class="note">(<span class="notewd">Note:</span> Tana'im argue (4b-5a) about whether (also or only) the Shevatim (tribes) bring bulls. In general, we will say 'Beis Din brings a Par', without concern for the different opinions.)</span></p>
<p class="bas indent1"><span class="nm">(c)</span><span class="cl">(Rav Dimi of Neharde'a):</span> Beis Din is liable only if they said 'you are permitted <i>La'asos</i> (to do)';</p>
<p class="bas indent2"><span class="nm">1.</span>If they did not say this, the Hora'ah was not final.</p>
<p class="bas indent1"><span class="nm">(d)</span><span class="cl">Support #1 (for Rav Dimi - Abaye - Mishnah):</span> If a Zaken Mamrei (a Chacham who ruled unlike the Sanhedrin) returned to his city, learned and taught like before, he is exempt;</p>
<p class="bas indent2"><span class="nm">1.</span>If he ruled La'asos, he is killed.</p>
<p class="bas indent1"><span class="nm">(e)</span><span class="cl">Support #2 (R. Aba - Mishnah):</span> (One witness testified that Leah's husband died. Beis Din told her that she may remarry.) If Leah was Mezanah (had relations without marriage), and her husband returned, she brings a Korban, for Beis Din allowed her only to remarry. (Rashi - they did not say 'you are permitted', therefore it is not considered Hora'ah. Ramah (in Tosfos ha'Rosh) - even though permission to remarry shows that she is (according to Beis Din) single and exempt for Zenus, still she is liable. This shows that Hora'ah is limited to the action that Beis Din permitted.)</p>
<p class="bas indent1"><span class="nm">(f)</span><span class="cl">Support #3 (Ravina - Mishnah):</span> If Beis Din gave a Hora'ah <i>to transgress</i>...</p>

<p class="bas indent1"><span class="nm">(b)</span><span class="cl">Question:</span> The Mishnah should say 'if an individual transgressed according to Beis Din.' Why must it say 'b'Shogeg'?</p>
<p class="bas indent1"><span class="nm">(c)</span><span class="cl">Version #1 - Answer #1 (Rava):</span> 'B'Shogeg' is when Beis Din permitted Chelev (forbidden fats), and an individual (wanted to eat other meat and) mistakenly ate Chelev;</p>
<p class="bas indent2"><span class="nm">1.</span>'According to Beis Din' is simply relying on Beis Din (he knowingly ate Chelev).</p>
<p class="bas indent1"><span class="nm">(d)</span><span class="cl">Version #2 - Answer #1 (Rava):</span> He is exempt only if his mistake was relying on Beis Din (he knowingly ate Chelev);</p>

<p class="bas indent1"><span class="nm">(e)</span>Rami bar Chama was unsure of this law.</p>
<p class="bas indent2"><span class="nm">1.</span><span class="cl">Question (Rami bar Chama):</span> If Beis Din permitted Chelev, and an individual mistakenly ate Chelev, what is the law?</p>
<p class="bas indent2"><span class="nm">2.</span><span class="cl">Version #1 - Answer (Rava):</span> We learn from extra words in the Mishnah. It says 'if an individual transgressed <i>b'Shogeg, according to Beis Din</i>';</p>
<p class="bas indent3"><span class="nm">i.</span>This includes this case (he is exempt).</p>
<p class="bas indent2"><span class="nm">3.</span><span class="cl">Rejection:</span> Perhaps this teaches that he is exempt only when his mistake was relying on Beis Din (he knowingly ate Chelev), but if he mistakenly ate Chelev, he is liable!</p>

<p class="bas indent2"><span class="nm">5.</span><span class="cl">Rejection:</span> Perhaps it teaches that he is exempt in either case, whether he mistakenly ate or relied on Beis Din. (end of Version #2)</p>
<p class="bas indent1"><span class="nm">(f)</span>Other Amora'im argued according to the two versions of Rava.</p>
<p class="bas indent2"><span class="nm">1.</span><span class="cl">(Rav):</span> If Beis Din permitted Chelev, and Reuven mistakenly ate Chelev, he is exempt;</p>
<p class="bas indent2"><span class="nm">2.</span><span class="cl">(R. Yochanan):</span> He is liable.</p>
<p class="bas indent1"><span class="nm">(g)</span><span class="cl">Question (against R. Yochanan - Beraisa):</span> "<i>From</i> the common people" excludes a Mumar;</p>
<p class="bas indent2"><span class="nm">1.</span>R. Shimon ben Yosi expounds "(if the Nasi... transgresses one of the Mitzvos... ) that one may not do, b'Shogeg, and is guilty. Or if he finds out" - one who would not have sinned knowingly brings a Korban. One who would have sinned knowingly does not bring a Korban;</p>
<p class="bas indent2"><span class="nm">2.</span>No other verse is needed to exclude a Mumar! (This refutes R. Yochanan. Since Beis Din permitted it, Reuven would have eaten it even had he known that it is Chelev!)</p>
<p class="bas indent1"><span class="nm">(h)</span><span class="cl">Answer (Rav Papa):</span> Since Beis Din would have retracted had they realized their mistake (and then Reuven would not have eaten knowingly), this is considered that he would not have eaten it knowingly.</p>
<p class="bas indent1"><span class="nm">(i)</span><span class="cl">(Rava):</span> Rav admits that Reuven is not counted towards a majority (of Yisrael) who transgressed according to Beis Din.</p>
<p class="bas indent1"><span class="nm">(j)</span><span class="cl">Question:</span> What is the reason?</p>
<p class="bas indent1"><span class="nm">(k)</span><span class="cl">Answer:</span> "Bi'Shgagah" - (the full majority) must all commit the same mistake (relying on Beis Din).</p>
<p class="bas indent1"><span class="nm">(l)</span><span class="cl">(Mishnah):</span> Whether he transgressed with Beis Din...</p>
<p class="bas indent1"><span class="nm">(m)</span><span class="cl">Question:</span> Why must the Mishnah teach three cases (transgressing with Beis Din, after Beis Din, and without Beis Din)?</p>
<p class="bas indent2"><span class="nm">1.</span>Granted, in the Reisha (first clause, in which he is exempt), each case is a bigger Chidush than the previous case.</p>
<p class="bas indent2"><span class="nm">2.</span>However, in the Seifa, when he is liable, each case is a smaller Chidush than the previous one. They should have been taught in the reverse order!</p>
<p class="bas bbbline">2b----------------------------------------2b</p>
<p class="bas indent1"><span class="nm">(n)</span><span class="cl">Answer:</span> Indeed, the Mishnah teaches the biggest Chidush, and then the smaller Chidushim!</p>

<p class="bas indent1"><span class="nm">(b)</span><span class="cl">Question:</span> Why must it teach both of these?</p>
<p class="bas indent1"><span class="nm">(c)</span><span class="cl">Answer (Rava):</span> One might have thought that he is liable (if he knew that Beis Din erred, and he transgressed) only if he is Gamir (learned; Rashi- learned the matter) <i>and</i> Savir (he can learn one matter from another through analysis), but Gamir <i>or</i> Savir is not enough. The Mishnah teaches that this is not so.</p>
<p class="bas indent1"><span class="nm">(d)</span><span class="cl">Question (Abaye):</span> A Chacham qualified to give Hora'ah must be Gamir and Savir!</p>
<p class="bas indent1"><span class="nm">(e)</span><span class="cl">Answer (Rava):</span> True! The Mishnah taught an extra clause to teach that he is liable even if he is only Gamir or Savir.</p>
<p class="bas indent1"><span class="nm">(f)</span><span class="cl">(Mishnah):</span> If he is qualified to give Hora'ah...</p>
<p class="bas indent1"><span class="nm">(g)</span><span class="cl">Question:</span> What is an example of someone qualified to give Hora'ah?</p>
<p class="bas indent1"><span class="nm">(h)</span><span class="cl">Answer (Rava):</span> Shimon ben Azai and Shimon ben Zoma are qualified.</p>
<p class="bas indent1"><span class="nm">(i)</span><span class="cl">Question (Abaye):</span> Surely, either of them would know the law. If he transgressed he would be Mezid. He would not bring a Korban!</p>
<p class="bas indent2"><span class="nm">1.</span><span class="cl">Counter-question (Rava - Beraisa):</span> "Ba'Asosah Achas (in transgressing one Mitzvah)" - an individual who relies on himself is liable, one who relies on Beis Din is exempt;</p>
<p class="bas indent3"><span class="nm">i.</span><span class="cl">Suggestion:</span> If Beis Din permitted Chelev, and one of them, or a Talmid who sits in front of them and is qualified to give Hora'ah, such as Ben Azai or Ben Zoma, knew that this is a mistake, perhaps he is exempt if he follows the Hora'ah of Beis Din!</p>
<p class="bas indent3"><span class="nm">ii.</span>"Ba'Asosah Achas" teaches that this is not so.</p>
<p class="bas indent2"><span class="nm">2.</span><span class="cl">Answer (Rava (Tosfos; Rashi - Abaye):</span> (Surely, Ben Azai knows the law.) We must say that he mistakenly thought that it is a Mitzvah to follow the Hora'ah of the Beis Din, even if it is wrong.</p>
<p class="bas indent1"><span class="nm">(j)</span><span class="cl">Answer (Rava):</span> Likewise, the Mishnah discusses a Chacham like Ben Azai. He brings a Korban if he mistakenly thought that it is a Mitzvah to follow a mistaken Hora'ah of Beis Din!</p>
<p class="bas indent1"><span class="nm">(k)</span><span class="cl">(Mishnah):</span> The general rule is, one who relies on himself (is liable)...</p>
<p class="bas indent1"><span class="nm">(l)</span><span class="cl">Question:</span> What does this come to include?</p>
<p class="bas indent1"><span class="nm">(m)</span><span class="cl">Answer:</span> It includes one who (normally) rejects the Hora'ah of Beis Din.</p>
<p class="bas indent1"><span class="nm">(n)</span><span class="cl">(Mishnah):</span> One who relies on Beis Din is exempt.</p>
<p class="bas indent1"><span class="nm">(o)</span><span class="cl">Question:</span> What does this come to include?</p>
<p class="bas indent1"><span class="nm">(p)</span><span class="cl">Answer:</span> It includes if Beis Din gave a Hora'ah and later retracted (and Reuven did not hear the retraction, and acted according to the Hora'ah).</p>
<p class="bas indent1"><span class="nm">(q)</span><span class="cl">Objection:</span> The continuation of our Mishnah (3b) explicitly teaches that!</p>

<p class="bas subject"><span class="nm">4)</span>LIKE WHOM IS THE MISHNAH?</p>
<p class="bas indent1"><span class="nm">(a)</span><span class="cl">(Rav Yehudah citing Shmuel):</span> Our Mishnah is like R. Yehudah, but Chachamim obligate an individual who relies on Beis Din.</p>
<p class="bas indent1"><span class="nm">(b)</span><span class="cl">Question:</span> What is the source that R. Yehudah exempts?</p>
<p class="bas indent1"><span class="nm">(c)</span><span class="cl">Answer (Beraisa #1):</span> "If <i>one soul</i> will sin b'Shogeg <i>in doing</i>" - these are 3 exclusions (exemptions from bringing a Korban, for one who did half the sin, one who had a partner in the act, and) one who relied on Beis Din. (We will explain later how we know that this is like R. Yehudah.)</p>
<p class="bas indent1"><span class="nm">(d)</span><span class="cl">Question:</span> What is the source that Chachamim obligate?</p>
<p class="bas indent1"><span class="nm">(e)</span><span class="cl">Answer (Beraisa #2) Suggestion:</span> Perhaps if the minority of Yisrael sinned, they are liable, for Beis Din does not bring Par He'elem Davar for them, but if the majority sinned, they are exempt, for Beis Din brings a Par for them;</p>
<p class="bas indent2"><span class="nm">1.</span><span class="cl">Rejection:</span> "From the common people" - even the majority, and even all of them (are liable).</p>
<p class="bas indent2"><span class="nm">2.</span><span class="cl">Question:</span> What is the case?</p>
<p class="bas indent3"><span class="nm">i.</span><span class="cl">Suggestion:</span> They transgressed b'Shogeg (not due to a Hora'ah).</p>
<p class="bas indent3"><span class="nm">ii.</span><span class="cl">Rejection:</span> If so, Beis Din does not bring a Par!</p>
<p class="bas indent2"><span class="nm">3.</span><span class="cl">Answer #1:</span> Rather, they relied on a Hora'ah of Beis Din.</p>
<p class="bas indent2"><span class="nm">4.</span><span class="cl">Rejection:</span> "From the common people" discusses transgressing b'Shogeg!</p>
<p class="bas indent2"><span class="nm">5.</span><span class="cl">Answer #2:</span> Rather, the Beraisa means as follows. If the minority of Yisrael sinned b'Shogeg, they bring Chata'os (sin-offerings), for Beis Din (when they give a mistaken Hora'ah) do not bring a Par for them (a minority who sinned due to the Hora'ah);</p>
<p class="bas indent3"><span class="nm">i.</span><span class="cl">Suggestion:</span> If the majority sinned b'Shogeg, perhaps they are exempt, for Beis Din brings a Par for them (when their mistaken Hora'ah caused the majority to sin)!</p>
<p class="bas indent3"><span class="nm">ii.</span><span class="cl">Rejection:</span> "From the common people" teaches that even if the majority or all of Yisrael sin, they bring Chata'os.</p>
<p class="bas indent1"><span class="nm">(f)</span><span class="cl">Question (Rav Papa):</span> We need not explain that way. We can say that when the minority sinned due to a mistaken Hora'ah of Beis Din, <i>neither</i> they nor Beis Din bring a Korban!</p>
<p class="bas indent1"><span class="nm">(g)</span><span class="cl">Rejection:</span> If so, why does the Tana use the verse to teach that the <i>majority</i> brings when they sin? He should first prove that the minority brings!</p>
<p class="bas indent2"><span class="nm">1.</span>Rather, when the minority sin due to a Hora'ah, each brings a Kisvah or Se'irah (female lamb or goat). We already know that they bring the same for transgressing b'Shogeg;</p>
<p class="bas indent2"><span class="nm">2.</span>Therefore, the verse teaches about the majority.</p>
<p class="bas indent1"><span class="nm">(h)</span><span class="cl">Question:</span> Both Beraisos are anonymous. How did Shmuel know that Beraisa #1 is like R. Yehudah, and Beraisa #2 is like Chachamim? Perhaps they are just the opposite!</p>
<p class="bas indent1"><span class="nm">(i)</span><span class="cl">Answer #1:</span> R. Yehudah often expounds multiple exclusions from one verse.</p>
<p class="bas indent2"><span class="nm">1.</span><span class="cl">(Beraisa - R. Yehudah):</span> "<i>This</i> is the law of <i>the</i> Olah (burnt offering), <i>it is</i>" are three exclusions.</p>
