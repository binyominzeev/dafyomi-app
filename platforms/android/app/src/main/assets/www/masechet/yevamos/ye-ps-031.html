<p class="bas subject"><span class="nm">1)</span><i>SAFEK</i> <i>KIDUSHIN</i> AND DIVORCE</p>
<p class="bas indent1"><span class="nm">(a)</span><span class="cl">Question:</span> We should teach the case of Gerushin (when we don't know to whom the Get was closer) and require Chalitzah, so people will know that this is only a stringency!</p>
<p class="bas indent1"><span class="nm">(b)</span><span class="cl">Answer:</span> If we would require Chalitzah, people would come to do Yibum!</p>
<p class="bas indent1"><span class="nm">(c)</span><span class="cl">Question:</span> Also regarding Safek Kidushin, we should be concerned lest requiring Chalitzah will lead people to do Yibum!</p>
<p class="bas indent1"><span class="nm">(d)</span><span class="cl">Answer:</span> There, it is no problem if they do Yibum. The Chazakah permits Yibum!</p>
<p class="bas indent1"><span class="nm">(e)</span><span class="cl">Question (Abaye - Mishnah):</span> If a house fell on a man and his brother's daughter (one of his wives), and we do not know who died first, the Tzarah does Chalitzah but not Yibum.</p>
<p class="bas indent2"><span class="nm">1.</span>We should follow the Chazakah that the Tzarah is exempt from Yibum and Chalitzah!</p>
<p class="bas indent2"><span class="nm">2.</span><span class="cl">Suggestion:</span> Perhaps it is a mere stringency to require Chalitzah.</p>
<p class="bas indent2"><span class="nm">3.</span><span class="cl">Rejection:</span> This stringency will lead to a leniency! If we require Chalitzah, people will come to do Yibum!</p>
<p class="bas indent1"><span class="nm">(f)</span><span class="cl">Answer #1:</span> Divorce is common, so Chachamim decreed not to do Chalitzah, lest people do Yibum. A house falling down is uncommon, so no decree was made.</p>
<p class="bas indent1"><span class="nm">(g)</span><span class="cl">Answer #2:</span> Regarding divorce the Ervah is alive, so people will think that Chachamim verified that the divorce was valid, and they will do Yibum with the Tzarah;</p>
<p class="bas indent2"><span class="nm">1.</span>When the house fell, no one will think that Chachamim clarified who died first!</p>
<p class="bas indent1"><span class="nm">(h)</span><span class="cl">Question (Mishnah):</span> If his wife was standing in a Reshus ha'Rabim, and he threw a Get to her:</p>
<p class="bas indent2"><span class="nm">1.</span>If it is closer to her, she is divorced. If it is closer to him, she is not divorced. If it is in the middle, she is divorced and not divorced.</p>
<p class="bas indent2"><span class="nm">2.</span><span class="cl">Question:</span> What does it mean 'divorced and not divorced'?</p>
<p class="bas indent2"><span class="nm">3.</span><span class="cl">Answer:</span> If he is a Kohen, she is forbidden to him. If she is Ervah [to the Yavam], her Tzarah must do Chalitzah.</p>
<p class="bas indent2"><span class="nm">4.</span><span class="cl">Summation of question:</span> We are not concerned lest requiring Chalitzah lead people to do Yibum!</p>
<p class="bas indent1"><span class="nm">(i)</span><span class="cl">Answer:</span> Rabah and Rav Yosef established that Mishnah to be when one pair of witnesses says that the Get was closer to her, and another pair says that it was closer to him. This is a Safek mid'Oraisa;</p>
<p class="bas indent2"><span class="nm">1.</span>Our Mishnah discusses when there is only one pair of witnesses. It is a Safek mid'Rabanan.</p>
<p class="bas indent1"><span class="nm">(j)</span><span class="cl">Objection #1:</span> What is the source that our Mishnah discusses when there is only one pair?</p>
<p class="bas indent1"><span class="nm">(k)</span><span class="cl">Answer:</span> Just like there is only one pair regarding Kidushin, also regarding divorce.</p>
<p class="bas indent1"><span class="nm">(l)</span><span class="cl">Question:</span> What is the source that there is only one pair regarding Kidushin? Perhaps there are two!</p>
<p class="bas indent1"><span class="nm">(m)</span><span class="cl">Answer:</span> If there were two pairs, there would be no reason not to do Yibum!</p>
<p class="bas indent1"><span class="nm">(n)</span><span class="cl">Rejection:</span> Two witnesses who say that the money was closer to her is a great reason not to do Yibum!</p>
<p class="bas indent1"><span class="nm">(o)</span><span class="cl">Objection #2:</span> Also when there are two pairs of witnesses, the Safek is mid'Rabanan!</p>
<p class="bas indent2"><span class="nm">1.</span>Mid'Oraisa, the pairs of witnesses cancel each other, and we follow her Chazakah (she is not Mekudeshes, so the Tzarah may do Yibum).</p>
<p class="bas indent2"><span class="nm">2.</span>We say so about the property of Bar Shatya (a man who alternated between sanity and insanity)!</p>
<p class="bas indent3"><span class="nm">i.</span>Bar Shatya sold property. Two witnesses testified that he was sane at the time, and two testified that he was insane at the time.</p>
<p class="bas indent3"><span class="nm">ii.</span><span class="cl">(Rav Ashi):</span> The witnesses cancel each other, and we follow the Chazakah that the property belongs to Bar Shatya.</p>
<p class="bas bbbline">31b----------------------------------------31b</p>
<p class="bas indent1"><span class="nm">(p)</span><span class="cl">Answer #2 (to question 4:d, Daf 30b - Abaye):</span> Each clause teaches about the other. The case of Kidushin also applies to divorce. The cases of divorce also apply to Kidushin.</p>
<p class="bas indent1"><span class="nm">(q)</span><span class="cl">Objection (Rava):</span> If so, what does 'This is (the case)' come to exclude?</p>
<p class="bas indent1"><span class="nm">(r)</span><span class="cl">Answer #3 (Rava):</span> The case of Kidushin also applies to divorce. There is a case of divorce that does not apply to Kidushin.</p>
<p class="bas indent2"><span class="nm">1.</span>'This is' regarding divorce doesn't exclude anything. It was taught for parallel structure with 'this is' regarding Kidushin.</p>
<p class="bas subject"><span class="nm">2)</span>A <i>SHTAR</i> <i>KIDUSHIN</i> DOES NOT NEED A DATE</p>
<p class="bas indent1"><span class="nm">(a)</span><span class="cl">Question:</span> What does 'this is' regarding Kidushin exclude?</p>
<p class="bas indent1"><span class="nm">(b)</span><span class="cl">Answer:</span> It excludes a Shtar Kidushin without a date (it is valid).</p>
<p class="bas indent1"><span class="nm">(c)</span><span class="cl">Question:</span> Why didn't Chachamim enact that a Shtar Kidushin needs a date?</p>
<p class="bas indent2"><span class="nm">1.</span>We understand according to the opinion that the date on a Get is to clarify from when the husband lost rights to receive Peiros (the yield of her property). He does not get Peiros until Nisu'in, so we do not need to know the date of Kidushin!</p>
<p class="bas indent2"><span class="nm">2.</span>However, some say that the date is to prevent a husband from saving his wife from execution if she had adultery (by giving her a Get without a date), e.g. if he married his sister's daughter, on whom he has compassion (normally, he is happy that she be killed). If so, the same concern exists regarding Kidushin!</p>
<p class="bas indent1"><span class="nm">(d)</span><span class="cl">Answer #1:</span> Because some people are Mekadesh with money, and some with Bi'ah (and we cannot enact a date for these), we did not enact for a document, either.</p>
<p class="bas indent1"><span class="nm">(e)</span><span class="cl">Question (Rav Acha):</span> A date was enacted for a deed of sale of a slave, even though some people buy with money, and some with a deed!</p>
<p class="bas indent1"><span class="nm">(f)</span><span class="cl">Answer:</span> Most people buy slaves with a deed; most people are Mekadesh women with money.</p>
<p class="bas indent1"><span class="nm">(g)</span><span class="cl">Answer #2 (to Question (c)):</span> We didn't enact a date on a Shtar Kidushin, since it would not (always) enable us to know when she is Chayav Misah:</p>
<p class="bas indent2"><span class="nm">1.</span>If we would enact that she keeps the document, she would erase the date (we cannot kill her unless we are sure)!</p>
<p class="bas indent2"><span class="nm">2.</span>If we would enact that he keeps the document, if he has compassion on her, e.g. when she is his sister's daughter, he will (erase the date to) cover up for her!</p>
<p class="bas indent2"><span class="nm">3.</span><span class="cl">Suggestion:</span> We should enact to leave it by the witnesses.</p>
<p class="bas indent2"><span class="nm">4.</span><span class="cl">Rejection:</span> If they remember the date, they do not need the document. If they do not remember the date, perhaps they will testify based on what they see written, and the Torah said that testimony must be "from their mouths", not from what they wrote!</p>
<p class="bas indent1"><span class="nm">(h)</span><span class="cl">Question:</span> If so, the same applies to divorce!</p>
<p class="bas indent1"><span class="nm">(i)</span><span class="cl">Answer:</span> There, the Get saves her (so she fears to erase the date. Tosfos - indeed, if she erased the date we could not kill her.) Here, the document condemns her!</p>
<p class="bas subject"><span class="nm">3)</span>A <i>YEVAMAH</i> WHO FALLS FROM TWO BROTHERS</p>
<p class="bas indent1"><span class="nm">(a)</span><span class="cl">(Mishnah):</span> Reuven, Shimon and Levi (brothers) were married to unrelated women. Reuven died. Shimon gave a Ma'amar to the Yevamah, then he died. Both Yevamos do Chalitzah, not Yibum;</p>
<p class="bas indent2"><span class="nm">1.</span>"U'Mes Echad Mehem Yevamah Yavo Aleha" - this is when she has Zikah from one brother, not from two.</p>
<p class="bas indent1"><span class="nm">(b)</span>R. Shimon says, Levi may do Yibum with whichever he wants, and Chalitzah to the other.</p>
<p class="bas indent1"><span class="nm">(c)</span><span class="cl">(Gemara) Question:</span> If the Isur of Zikah from two brothers is mid'Oraisa, Chalitzah should not be required!</p>
<p class="bas indent1"><span class="nm">(d)</span><span class="cl">Answer:</span> The Isur is only mid'Rabanan, lest people say that when two Yevamos fall from one brother, both may do Yibum.</p>
<p class="bas indent1"><span class="nm">(e)</span><span class="cl">Question:</span> We should say that one does Yibum and the other does Chalitzah!</p>
<p class="bas indent1"><span class="nm">(f)</span><span class="cl">Answer:</span> We decreed not to, lest people say that some Yevamos from a brother do Yibum and others do Chalitzah.</p>
<p class="bas indent1"><span class="nm">(g)</span><span class="cl">Question:</span> What is wrong if they say this?</p>
<p class="bas indent1"><span class="nm">(h)</span><span class="cl">Answer:</span> If they would do Yibum and then Chalitzah, there would be no problem. The concern is lest they do Chalitzah and then Yibum;</p>
<p class="bas indent2"><span class="nm">1.</span>"Who will not build... " - once Chalitzah is done, it is forbidden to do Yibum.</p>
