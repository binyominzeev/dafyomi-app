<div class="subject"><span class="nm">1)</span><p>USES OF TAMEI TERUMAH</p></div>
<div class="indent1"><span class="nm">(a)</span><p><span class="cl">Question:</span> Where did Rav Ashi teach about soaking to make something repulsive?</p></div>
<div class="indent1"><span class="nm">(b)</span><p><span class="cl">Answer (R. Avin bar Rav Acha):</span> Aba Sha'ul was the kneader for Rebbi's house - they would use wheat of Tamei Terumah to heat water for him for kneading [even though he kneaded] in Taharah.</p></div>
<div class="indent1"><span class="nm">(c)</span><p><span class="cl">Question:</span> We should be concerned for Takalah!</p></div>
<div class="indent1"><span class="nm">(d)</span><p><span class="cl">Answer (Rav Ashi):</span> He cooked it and then made it repulsive.</p></div>
<div class="indent1"><span class="nm">(e)</span><p><span class="cl">(Mishnah):</span> If stalks of Terumah became Tamei and were planted, they are Tehorim, but may not be eaten.</p></div>
<div class="indent1"><span class="nm">(f)</span><p>Question (Rava bar Masnah) If they are Tehorim, why are they forbidden to eat?</p></div>
<div class="indent1"><span class="nm">(g)</span><p><span class="cl">Answer #1 (Abaye bar Avin and Rav Chananya bar Avin):</span> It means that they are forbidden to Zarim.</p></div>
<div class="indent1"><span class="nm">(h)</span><p><span class="cl">Objection:</span> Is the Chidush that Gidulei (what grows from Terumah) is Terumah?! We already learn this from another Mishnah!</p></div>
<div class="indent2"><span class="nm">1.</span><p><span class="cl">(Mishnah):</span> Gidulei Terumah are Terumah.</p></div>
<div class="indent1"><span class="nm">(i)</span><p><span class="cl">Answer:</span> The extra Mishnah teaches that Gidulim of Gidulei Terumah are Terumah.</p></div>
<div class="indent1"><span class="nm">(j)</span><p><span class="cl">Objection:</span> Does this teach about something in which the seed does not disintegrate?! We already learn this from another Mishnah!</p></div>
<div class="indent2"><span class="nm">1.</span><p><span class="cl">(Mishnah):</span> Gidulei Tevel of seeds that disintegrate are permitted; if the seed does not disintegrate, even Gidulim of Gidulei Tevel are forbidden to eat.</p></div>
<div class="indent1"><span class="nm">(k)</span><p>Abaye and Rav Chananya could not answer.</p></div>
<div class="indent1"><span class="nm">(l)</span><p><span class="cl">Answer #2 (Rava bar Masnah citing Rav Sheshes):</span> They are forbidden to Kohanim on account of Hese'ach ha'Da'as (once they became Tamei he ceased to guard them - this is not "Mishmeres Terumosai").</p></div>
<div class="subject"><span class="nm">2)</span><p>HESE'ACH HA'DA'AS</p></div>
<div class="indent1"><span class="nm">(a)</span><p><span class="cl">Question:</span> This is like the opinion that Hese'ach ha'Da'as is Pesul ha'Guf (this itself is Posel) - but according to the opinion that it is a Pasul of Tum'ah (mi'Safek, lest it became Tamei), how can we answer? (Even though it surely was Tamei, planting was Metaher it! The Gemara explains these opinions before answering the question.)</p></div>
<div class="indent1"><span class="nm">(b)</span><p><span class="cl">(R. Yochanan):</span> Hese'ach ha'Da'as is a Pesul of Tum'ah - if [a prophet, e.g.] Eliyahu would tell us that it is Tahor, it would be permitted;</p></div>
<div class="indent1"><span class="nm">(c)</span><p><span class="cl">(Reish Lakish):</span> It is an intrinsic Pesul - even if Eliyahu would Metaher it, it is forbidden.</p></div>
<div class="indent1"><span class="nm">(d)</span><p><span class="cl">Question (R. Yochanan - Beraisa - R. Yishmael, son of R. Yochanan ben Brokah):</span> There was a small gap between the ramp and the Mizbe'ach on the west side - there they would throw Pasul Chata'os ha'Of; after Ibur Tzurah (letting them become Nosar), they are burned in Beis ha'Sereifah.</p></div>
<div class="indent2"><span class="nm">1.</span><p>If Hese'ach ha'Da'as is a Pesul of Tum'ah, we understand why Ibur Tzurah is required - if perhaps Eliyahu will Metaher it;</p></div>
<div class="indent2"><span class="nm">2.</span><p>But if it is an intrinsic Pesul, why is Ibur Tzurah required?</p></div>
<div class="bbbline">34b----------------------------------------34b</p></div>
<div class="indent3"><span class="nm">i.</span><p><span class="cl">(Beraisa):</span> Any Pesul ha'Guf may be burned immediately;</p></div>
<div class="indent3"><span class="nm">ii.</span><p>A Pesul of the blood (e.g. it was spilled) or the owners (e.g. a Chaburah cannot eat Pesach) is burned in Beis ha'Sereifah after Ibur Tzurah [but not immediately, because the meat itself is fine].</p></div>
<div class="indent1"><span class="nm">(e)</span><p><span class="cl">Answer (Reish Lakish):</span> The Beraisa is like Tana d'vei Rabah bar Avuha, who holds that even Pigul [which was never permitted] requires Ibur Tzurah.</p></div>
<div class="indent1"><span class="nm">(f)</span><p><span class="cl">Question (Mishnah - R. Eliezer):</span> If the meat became Tamei, Pasul, or left the Azarah, we throw the blood;</p></div>
<div class="indent2"><span class="nm">1.</span><p>R. Yehoshua says, we do not throw it;</p></div>
<div class="indent2"><span class="nm">2.</span><p>R. Yehoshua admits that if Zerikah was done, Hurtzah (the owner fulfilled his obligation).</p></div>
<div class="indent2"><span class="nm">3.</span><p><span class="cl">Assumption:</span> Since it also mentions Tamei and Yotzei, 'Pasul' must refer to Hese'ach ha'Da'as!</p></div>
<div class="indent2"><span class="nm">4.</span><p>If Hese'ach ha'Da'as is a Pesul of Tum'ah , we understand this - the Tzitz is Meratzeh (makes it acceptable even if it was Tamei);</p></div>
<div class="indent3"><span class="nm">i.</span><p>But if Hese'ach ha'Da'as is a Pesul ha'Guf, why was it Hurtzah?</p></div>
<div class="indent1"><span class="nm">(g)</span><p><span class="cl">Answer (and rejection of assumption):</span> No, the meat became Pasul through a Tevul Yom.</p></div>
<div class="indent1"><span class="nm">(h)</span><p><span class="cl">Objection:</span> If so, this is just like becoming Tamei (why were both taught)?</p></div>
<div class="subject"><span class="nm">3)</span><p>STRINGENCIES OF THINGS THAT ARE KODESH</p></div>
<div class="indent1"><span class="nm">(a)</span><p><span class="cl">Answer #3 (to Question 1:f - R. Yirmeyah):</span> Reish Lakish taught that if Mei ha'Chag (water poured on the Mizbe'ach on Sukos) became Tamei:</p></div>
<div class="indent2"><span class="nm">1.</span><p>If one did Hashakah and was Mekadesh them, they are Tehorim; (Hashakah is connecting water to a Mikveh to Metaher it. Immersion does not Metaher food or drink - rather, it is Tahor on account of 'Zeri'ah' - anything connected to the ground cannot be Tamei.)</p></div>
<div class="indent2"><span class="nm">2.</span><p>If one was Mekadesh them and then did Hashakah, they are Temei'im.</p></div>
<div class="indent2"><span class="nm">3.</span><p><span class="cl">Question:</span> In both cases, this is Zeri'ah - why does it matter whether they were Hukdash before or after?</p></div>
<div class="indent2"><span class="nm">4.</span><p><span class="cl">Answer:</span> Zeri'ah [of water, i.e. Hashakah] does not help for Hekdesh (Tosfos - mid'Oraisa; Rashi - this is a mid'Rabanan stringency of Hekdesh);</p></div>
<div class="indent2"><span class="nm">5.</span><p><span class="cl">Summation of answer #3:</span> Similarly, Zeri'ah [of seeds, i.e. planting] does not help for Terumah [mid'Rabanan]!</p></div>
<div class="indent1"><span class="nm">(b)</span><p><span class="cl">Question (Abaye):</span> Is this only when the water was Hukdash in a Keli - but if the Hekdesh was only verbal, Chachamim were not stringent to say that Zeri'ah does not Metaher;</p></div>
<div class="indent2"><span class="nm">1.</span><p>Or, were they stringent even regarding verbal Hekdesh?</p></div>
<div class="indent1"><span class="nm">(c)</span><p><span class="cl">Answer (Rav Dimi):</span> I did not hear this explicitly, but I heard another law from which we can learn:</p></div>
<div class="indent2"><span class="nm">1.</span><p><span class="cl">(R. Yochanan):</span> If one stomped Tamei grapes and then was Makdish them, the wine is Tahor;</p></div>
<div class="indent2"><span class="nm">2.</span><p>If the was Makdish Tamei grapes and then stomped them, the wine is Tamei.</p></div>
<div class="indent2"><span class="nm">3.</span><p>Hekdesh of the grapes was verbal, nevertheless Chachamim made a stringency [to Metamei juice inside Tamei grapes]!</p></div>
<div class="indent1"><span class="nm">(d)</span><p><span class="cl">Rejection (Rav Yosef):</span> The 'Hekdesh' R. Yochanan discusses is declaration to be Terumah - they are not Hukdash in a Keli, therefore we are stringent after verbal 'Hekdesh' alone;</p></div>
<div class="indent2"><span class="nm">1.</span><p>Mei ha'Chag must be Hukdash in a Keli, therefore we are stringent only after this was done.</p></div>
<div class="indent1"><span class="nm">(e)</span><p><span class="cl">Inference:</span> R. Yochanan is Metaher when one stomped Tamei grapes before Hekdesh - he did not limit the amount stomped;</p></div>
<div class="indent1"><span class="nm">(f)</span><p><span class="cl">Contradiction (R. Yochanan):</span> If grapes became Tamei, one may stomp less than k'Beitzah at a time.</p></div>
<div class="indent1"><span class="nm">(g)</span><p><span class="cl">Answer #1:</span> Here also, he discusses stomping less than k'Beitzah at a time.</p></div>
<div class="indent1"><span class="nm">(h)</span><p><span class="cl">Answer #2:</span> There [he is stringent because] he discusses grapes that touched a Rishon, they are a Sheni; here he discusses grapes that touched a Sheni, they are a Shelishi. (The grapes cannot be Terumah, for we are stringent to Metamei the juice inside Tamei Terumah! Rather, they are Chulin which one guards [from Tum'ah] like Terumah, which can become a Shelishi.)</p></div>
<div class="indent1"><span class="nm">(i)</span><p><span class="cl">Version #1 (Tosfos) Support #1 (for R. Yirmeyah - Rava - Beraisa):</span> "V'Nosan Alav Mayim Chayim El Keli" - [even when] the water is <i>Chai</i> in the Keli (flowing, i.e. in the river), it says "V'Nosan" [connoting that it is <i>like</i> detached water, i.e. it is Mekabel Tum'ah];</p></div>
<div class="indent2"><span class="nm">1.</span><p><span class="cl">Question:</span> Connected water is not Mekabel Tum'ah!</p></div>
<div class="indent2"><span class="nm">2.</span><p><span class="cl">Answer:</span> This is a stringency of Kodesh (mid'Oraisa, Hashakah does not help);</p></div>
<div class="indent1"><span class="nm">(j)</span><p><span class="cl">Version #2 (Rashi) Support (for Rav Dimi and R. Yirmeyah - Rava - Beraisa):</span> "V'Nosan Alav Mayim Chayim El Keli" - [Kidush (mixing with the ashes) must be in] the [same] Keli in which the water was Chai (i.e. when it was drawn from the river).</p></div>
<div class="indent2"><span class="nm">1.</span><p><span class="cl">Question:</span> Surely one may transfer them to another Keli - it says "V'Nosan"!</p></div>
<div class="indent2"><span class="nm">2.</span><p><span class="cl">Answer:</span> Indeed, this is true [mid'Oraisa - the verse is an Asmachta (an allusion to a mid'Rabanan law,] we are stringent [to require the same Keli, even though this is like Kedushas Peh, for the Keli is Chulin - Ginzei Yosef on Maharsha); (end of Version #2)</p></div>
<div class="indent2"><span class="nm">3.</span><p>Similarly, we are stringent here [to say that Zeri'ah does not Metaher Terumah! According to Rashi, the coming Amora'im (35A) do not solidly support R. Yirmeyah, for they only show that there are mid'Oraisa stringencies of Kodesh.]</p></div>
