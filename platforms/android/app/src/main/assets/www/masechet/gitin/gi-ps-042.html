<p class="bas subject"><span class="nm">1)</span>HALF-FREEDOM</p>
<p class="bas indent1"><span class="nm">(a)</span><span class="cl">(Mishnah):</span> A half-slave...</p>
<p class="bas indent1"><span class="nm">(b)</span>According to Rabah, the Mishnah can be like everyone. The slave was half-freed through money.</p>
<p class="bas indent1"><span class="nm">(c)</span><span class="cl">Question:</span> According to Rav Yosef, must we say that the Mishnah is only like Rebbi?!</p>
<p class="bas indent1"><span class="nm">(d)</span><span class="cl">Answer (Ravina):</span> The Mishnah can be like everyone. The slave belonged to partners, and one partner freed his half.</p>
<p class="bas indent1"><span class="nm">(e)</span><span class="cl">(Rabah):</span> Rebbi and Chachamim argue only about when the master frees half and retains the other half;</p>
<p class="bas indent2"><span class="nm">1.</span>If the master frees half and sells or gives the other half for a gift, since the slave totally leaves the master, all agree that this works.</p>
<p class="bas indent1"><span class="nm">(f)</span><span class="cl">Question (Abaye):</span> They argue even if this case!</p>
<p class="bas indent2"><span class="nm">1.</span><span class="cl">(Beraisa #1):</span> If one wrote a document giving all his property to his two slaves, they acquire the property, and free each other;</p>
<p class="bas indent2"><span class="nm">2.</span><span class="cl">(Beraisa #2):</span> If one wrote a document saying 'all my property is given to my two slaves', they do not even acquire themselves.</p>
<p class="bas indent2"><span class="nm">3.</span><span class="cl">Suggestion:</span> Beraisa #1 is like Rebbi, and Beraisa #2 is like Chachamim.</p>
<p class="bas indent1"><span class="nm">(g)</span><span class="cl">Answer:</span> No, both are like Chachamim. In Beraisa #1, he gave to each slave a document giving all his property. In Beraisa #2, the document says that each slave receives half.</p>
<p class="bas indent1"><span class="nm">(h)</span><span class="cl">Question (Seifa of Beraisa #2):</span> If he said half-half, they do not acquire.</p>
<p class="bas indent2"><span class="nm">1.</span><span class="cl">Inference:</span> In the Reisha, the document says that he gives all his property!</p>
<p class="bas indent1"><span class="nm">(i)</span><span class="cl">Answer #1:</span> No, the Seifa explains the Reisha. They do not even acquire themselves if he said half-half.</p>
<p class="bas indent2"><span class="nm">1.</span><span class="cl">Support:</span> This must be correct. If in the Reisha, he gave all his property, and they do not acquire, there would be no need to teach the case of half-half!</p>
<p class="bas indent2"><span class="nm">2.</span><span class="cl">Rejection:</span> No. The Seifa is needed, lest we say that the case is that he said half-half, but had he said 'all', they would acquire.</p>
<p class="bas indent3"><span class="nm">i.</span>Since the Seifa explicitly teaches about half-half, we infer that in the Reisha, he said all, and still, they do not acquire.</p>
<p class="bas indent1"><span class="nm">(j)</span><span class="cl">Answer #2:</span> In Beraisa #1, he gave a document to each slave. In Beraisa #2, he gave one document to both of them.</p>
<p class="bas indent1"><span class="nm">(k)</span><span class="cl">Question:</span> If he only wrote one document, why does the Beraisa say that he wrote half-half? Even if it said 'all', they would not acquire!</p>
<p class="bas indent1"><span class="nm">(l)</span>Indeed, the Beraisa means this!</p>
<p class="bas indent2"><span class="nm">1.</span>If he only wrote one document, they do not acquire themselves. If he gave each a document, they acquire themselves;</p>
<p class="bas indent2"><span class="nm">2.</span>If he wrote half-half, even if each got his own document, they do not acquire themselves.</p>
<p class="bas indent1"><span class="nm">(m)</span><span class="cl">Answer #3:</span> (Each document says 'all'.) In Beraisa #1, he gave the documents simultaneously. In Beraisa #2, he gave them one after the other.</p>
<p class="bas indent2"><span class="nm">1.</span><span class="cl">Objection:</span> Granted, if he gave one after the other, the latter does not acquire. However, the first should acquire himself and the other slave!</p>
<p class="bas indent2"><span class="nm">2.</span>This answer is rejected. We must answer like Answer #1 or Answer #2.</p>
<p class="bas indent1"><span class="nm">(n)</span><span class="cl">Answer #4 (Rav Ashi):</span> In Beraisa #2, they do not acquire because the document calls them slaves. (This shows that he does not intend to free them.)</p>
<p class="bas indent1"><span class="nm">(o)</span><span class="cl">Objection (Rafram):</span> Perhaps it means 'who used to be my slaves'!</p>
<p class="bas indent2"><span class="nm">1.</span><span class="cl">(Mishnah):</span> If Reuven wrote a document giving all his property to his slave, he goes free. If Reuven retained any land for himself, he does not go free;</p>
<p class="bas indent2"><span class="nm">2.</span>R. Shimon says, he always goes free unless Reuven writes 'all my property is given to my slave except for one part in 10,000,'</p>
<p class="bas indent3"><span class="nm">i.</span>Had he not retained something for himself, the slave would go free, even though the document calls him a slave.</p>
<p class="bas indent3"><span class="nm">ii.</span>We must say, it means 'who used to be my slave.' We can say the same in the Beraisa!</p>
<p class="bas subject"><span class="nm">2)</span>THE LAW OF A HALF-SLAVE</p>
<p class="bas indent1"><span class="nm">(a)</span>If an ox gored a half-slave on a day when he works for his master, the master receives damage payments. If it was on his own day (when the half-slave works for himself), he keeps the payments.</p>
<p class="bas indent1"><span class="nm">(b)</span><span class="cl">Question:</span> If so, on his master's day he should be permitted to marry a slave, and on his own day, he should be permitted to marry a Bas Yisrael!</p>
<p class="bas indent1"><span class="nm">(c)</span><span class="cl">Answer:</span> The division of the slave between the master and himself is only financial. It does not affect Isurim.</p>
<p class="bas indent1"><span class="nm">(d)</span><span class="cl">Question (Beraisa):</span> If Reuven's ox (a Mu'ad, an established gorer) killed a half-slave, Reuven pays half of the fine (for a slave killed by a Mu'ad) to the master, and half the Kofer (ransom for a free man killed by a Mu'ad) to the half-slave's heirs.</p>
<p class="bas bbbline">42b----------------------------------------42b</p>
<p class="bas indent2"><span class="nm">1.</span>Why don't we say that if he was gored on the master's day, the master gets the full fine, and if it was on the slave's day, his heirs get the full Kofer!</p>
<p class="bas indent1"><span class="nm">(e)</span><span class="cl">Answer:</span> The division of days applies only to the earnings. This case is different, for the principal (the slave) was consumed (died)!</p>
<p class="bas indent1"><span class="nm">(f)</span><span class="cl">Question:</span> Above, we said that the one whose day it was receives payments for damage. In what case does damage not (at least partially) consume the principal?</p>
<p class="bas indent1"><span class="nm">(g)</span><span class="cl">Answer #1:</span> His hand was gored. It dried up, but later it will fully heal.</p>
<p class="bas indent1"><span class="nm">(h)</span><span class="cl">Question:</span> This is like Abaye, who says that a man who inflicts such a wound pays both Nezek (the decrease in the slave-market value of the victim) and Sheves (compensation for inability to work until he recovers).</p>
<p class="bas indent2"><span class="nm">1.</span>Rava holds that he pays only Sheves. The owner of an animal that gored pays only Nezek. How can Rava answer?</p>
<p class="bas indent1"><span class="nm">(i)</span><span class="cl">Answer #2:</span> The case is, a man wounded the half-slave.</p>
<p class="bas indent1"><span class="nm">(j)</span><span class="cl">Answer #3:</span> Amora'im taught that the payment goes to the one whose day it was. Rava disagrees.</p>
<p class="bas subject"><span class="nm">3)</span>A SLAVE WAITING TO BE FREED</p>
<p class="bas indent1"><span class="nm">(a)</span><span class="cl">Question:</span> If Shimon's slave (Tavi) is Me'ukav Get Shichrur (Shimon must free him), Shimon may not force him to work. If an animal gores Tavi, does Shimon receive the fine (that would be paid for a regular slave)?</p>
<p class="bas indent2"><span class="nm">1.</span>"Thirty Shekalim will be paid to the master" - Shimon is not his master, so he doesn't get it;</p>
<p class="bas indent2"><span class="nm">2.</span>Or, perhaps he is like a master, since he must give a Get?</p>
<p class="bas indent1"><span class="nm">(b)</span><span class="cl">Answer #1 (Beraisa):</span> If Reuven's ox killed a half-slave, Reuven pays half of the fine to the master, and half the Kofer to the half-slave's heirs.</p>
<p class="bas indent2"><span class="nm">1.</span><span class="cl">Suggestion:</span> This Beraisa is like the latter Mishnah, which forces a master to free his half-slave.</p>
<p class="bas indent1"><span class="nm">(c)</span><span class="cl">Rejection:</span> No, it is like the original Mishnah, which does not force him.</p>
<p class="bas indent1"><span class="nm">(d)</span><span class="cl">Answer #2 (Beraisa):</span> If a master knocked out the tooth of his slave and blinded his eye, the slave goes free due to the tooth, and the master must pay him for his eye.</p>
<p class="bas indent2"><span class="nm">1.</span>If the master of a slave (whom he must free) receives the fine if another man's ox gores the slave, it is illogical that the master would have to pay the slave if he himself hit him!</p>
<p class="bas indent1"><span class="nm">(e)</span><span class="cl">Rejection:</span> The Beraisa is like the opinion that the slave goes free (due to the tooth) and does not need a Get of freedom.</p>
<p class="bas indent2"><span class="nm">1.</span><span class="cl">(Beraisa - R. Yishmael, R. Eliezer and R. Akiva):</span> If a master destroys any of the external limbs of his slave, the slave goes free, and needs a Get of freedom;</p>
<p class="bas indent2"><span class="nm">2.</span>R. Meir and R. Tarfon say, he goes free and does not need a Get;</p>
<p class="bas indent2"><span class="nm">3.</span>The arbitrators say, if a tooth or eye was knocked out, since the Torah said that he goes free, a Get is not needed. If any other limb was destroyed, he needs a Get, since he goes free due to a fine mid'Rabanan.</p>
<p class="bas indent2"><span class="nm">4.</span><span class="cl">Question:</span> This is not a fine mid'Rabanan. Chachamim expounded verses!</p>
<p class="bas indent2"><span class="nm">5.</span><span class="cl">Answer:</span> Rather, it is because it is a fine expounded by Chachamim.</p>
<p class="bas indent1"><span class="nm">(f)</span><span class="cl">Question:</span> If a Kohen's slave is Me'ukav Get Shichrur, may the slave eat Terumah?</p>
<p class="bas indent2"><span class="nm">1.</span>"The acquisition of his money may eat (Terumah)" - this slave is not the Kohen's property!</p>
<p class="bas indent2"><span class="nm">2.</span>Or, since the Kohen must give him a Get, he is like his property!</p>
<p class="bas indent1"><span class="nm">(g)</span><span class="cl">Answer:</span> Rav Mesharshiya taught that if the children of a Kohen's wife and her slave got mixed up, the children may eat Terumah, and they receive one share of Terumah at the granaries;</p>
<p class="bas indent2"><span class="nm">1.</span>When they grow up, they free each other.</p>
<p class="bas indent1"><span class="nm">(h)</span><span class="cl">Rejection:</span> That is no proof. There, they eat, because if we would find out which is the slave, he is truly the property of his master;</p>
<p class="bas indent2"><span class="nm">1.</span>In our question, the master has no right to make the slave work!</p>
