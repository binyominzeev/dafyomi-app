<p class="bas subject"><span class="nm">1)</span>NOACH WAS NOT A TEREIFAH</p>
<p class="bas indent1"><span class="nm">(a)</span><span class="cl">Question:</span> Perhaps Noach was a Treifah!</p>
<p class="bas indent1"><span class="nm">(b)</span><span class="cl">Answer #1:</span> This cannot be. The Torah calls him "Tamim".</p>
<p class="bas indent2"><span class="nm">1.</span><span class="cl">Question:</span> Perhaps it means that he was Tamim (pure) in his ways!</p>
<p class="bas indent2"><span class="nm">2.</span><span class="cl">Answer:</span> We already know that, for he is called a Tzadik.</p>
<p class="bas indent2"><span class="nm">3.</span><span class="cl">Question:</span> Perhaps it means that he was Tamim in his ways and Tzadik in his deeds!</p>
<p class="bas indent1"><span class="nm">(c)</span><span class="cl">Answer #2:</span> If Noach were a Treifah, the Torah would not say "Itach", to bring specifically animals that are Treifah!</p>
<p class="bas indent1"><span class="nm">(d)</span><span class="cl">Question:</span> Since "Itach" excludes a Treifah, what do we learn from "Lechayos Zera"?</p>
<p class="bas indent1"><span class="nm">(e)</span><span class="cl">Answer:</span> Had it said only "Itach", one might have thought that the animals are merely to accompany the people, and old or castrated animals are acceptable. "Lechayos Zera" teaches that they must be able to reproduce.</p>
<p class="bas subject"><span class="nm">2)</span>BUSINESS BEFORE THEIR FESTIVALS</p>
<p class="bas indent1"><span class="nm">(a)</span><span class="cl">Question:</span> Is the day of the festival included in the three days that one may not (Rashi - buy from or) sell to Nochrim?</p>
<p class="bas indent1"><span class="nm">(b)</span><span class="cl">Answer #1 (Mishnah - R. Yishmael):</span> Three days before and three days after are forbidden.</p>
<p class="bas indent2"><span class="nm">1.</span>If three days includes the day of the festival, R. Yishmael counts the day of the festival twice!</p>
<p class="bas indent1"><span class="nm">(c)</span><span class="cl">Rejection:</span> Really, it includes the day of the festival. He taught 'three days after' for parallel structure with 'three days before.'</p>
<p class="bas indent1"><span class="nm">(d)</span><span class="cl">Answer #2:</span> Rav Tachlifa bar Avdimi taught that according to R. Yishmael, one may never do business with Nochrim who celebrate Yom Rishon.</p>
<p class="bas indent2"><span class="nm">1.</span>If three days includes the day of the festival, Wednesday and Thursday would be permitted!</p>
<p class="bas indent1"><span class="nm">(e)</span><span class="cl">Rejection:</span> Surely, R. Yishmael forbids three days in addition to the day of the festival. The question is according to Chachamim.</p>
<p class="bas indent1"><span class="nm">(f)</span><span class="cl">Answer #3 (Ravina - Mishnah):</span> These are the festivals (before which business is forbidden for three days): Kalanda, Satroniya, and Kartsim...</p>
<p class="bas indent2"><span class="nm">1.</span><span class="cl">(Rav Chanin bar Rava):</span> Kalanda is an eight-day festival after Tekufas Teves (the winter solstice, i.e. the shortest day of the year). Satroniya is an eight-day festival before the Tekufah.</p>
<p class="bas indent3"><span class="nm">i.</span>A way to remember this is "Achor va'Kedem Tzartani" (the latter festival is listed first in the Mishnah).</p>
<p class="bas indent2"><span class="nm">2.</span>If 'three days' includes the day of the festival, then regarding eight-day festivals, the Mishnah should say that 10 days are forbidden!</p>
<p class="bas indent1"><span class="nm">(g)</span><span class="cl">Rejection:</span> The Tana considers the whole festival like one day, so he says that three days are forbidden.</p>
<p class="bas indent1"><span class="nm">(h)</span><span class="cl">Answer #4 (Rav Ashi - Mishnah):</span> Three days before their festivals...</p>
<p class="bas indent2"><span class="nm">1.</span>If 'three days' included the festival, the Tana would mention that the festivals themselves are forbidden, e.g. 'the festivals: three days are forbidden... ' (Rather, the Tana does not explicitly teach the festivals themselves, only the three previous days. We know the festivals themselves from a Kal va'Chomer).</p>
<p class="bas indent2"><span class="nm">2.</span><span class="cl">Question:</span> Perhaps he taught 'three days before their festivals' to teach that the days after are permitted!</p>
<p class="bas indent2"><span class="nm">3.</span><span class="cl">Rejection:</span> To do so, he could have said 'the festivals: three days before them... '</p>
<p class="bas indent2"><span class="nm">4.</span><span class="cl">Conclusion:</span> The three days do not include the festival.</p>
<p class="bas subject"><span class="nm">3)</span>THE REASON FOR THE PROHIBITION</p>
<p class="bas indent1"><span class="nm">(a)</span><span class="cl">Question:</span> Why is it forbidden to do business with them?</p>
<p class="bas indent2"><span class="nm">1.</span>Are we concerned for Harvachah? (Rashi - if they profit, they will thank their idolatry. The Yisrael transgresses "Lo Yishama Al Picha" by causing them to mention the idolatry; R. Tam - if the Nochri has more animals, he is more likely to offer to idolatry);</p>
<p class="bas indent2"><span class="nm">2.</span>Or, if a Yisrael sells something that the Nochri will offer to idolatry, the Yisrael transgresses "v'Lifnei Iver Lo Siten Michshol" (by enabling him to sin)?</p>
<p class="bas indent2"><span class="nm">3.</span><span class="cl">Question:</span> What difference does it make?</p>
<p class="bas indent2"><span class="nm">4.</span><span class="cl">Answer:</span> If the Nochri already has an animal, 'Lifnei Iver' does not apply, but Harvachah does.</p>
<p class="bas indent2"><span class="nm">5.</span><span class="cl">Question:</span> 'Lifnei Iver' applies even when he has his own animal!</p>
<p class="bas indent3"><span class="nm">i.</span><span class="cl">(Beraisa - R. Noson):</span> "V'Lifnei Iver Lo Siten Michshol" forbids extending wine to a Nazir or a limb from a living animal to a Nochri.</p>
<p class="bas bbbline">6b----------------------------------------6b</p>
<p class="bas indent3"><span class="nm">ii.</span>Even though the Nazir or Nochri could take it himself, one who gives him transgresses!</p>
<p class="bas indent2"><span class="nm">6.</span><span class="cl">Answer:</span> The case is, he is on the other side of a river, and he cannot reach it himself.</p>
<p class="bas indent3"><span class="nm">i.</span><span class="cl">Support:</span> The Beraisa mentions extending it to him, but not 'giving' it.</p>
<p class="bas subject"><span class="nm">4)</span>ONE WHO DID BUSINESS</p>
<p class="bas indent1"><span class="nm">(a)</span><span class="cl">Question:</span> If one (Rashi - bought from or) sold to Nochrim before the festival, may he benefit from the (item or) money?</p>
<p class="bas indent1"><span class="nm">(b)</span><span class="cl">Answer #1 (R. Yochanan):</span> No.</p>
<p class="bas indent1"><span class="nm">(c)</span><span class="cl">Answer #2 (Reish Lakish):</span> Yes.</p>
<p class="bas indent1"><span class="nm">(d)</span><span class="cl">Version #1 Question (R. Yochanan - Beraisa):</span> If one (bought from or) sold to Nochrim at festival time, he may not benefit from the (item or) money.</p>
<p class="bas indent2"><span class="nm">1.</span><span class="cl">Suggestion:</span> This means if one (bought or) sold before the festival.</p>
<p class="bas indent1"><span class="nm">(e)</span><span class="cl">Answer:</span> No, it means if he sold on the festival.</p>
<p class="bas indent1"><span class="nm">(f)</span><span class="cl">Version #2 Question (Reish Lakish - Beraisa):</span> If one (bought or) sold on the festival, he may not benefit from it.</p>
<p class="bas indent2"><span class="nm">1.</span><span class="cl">Suggestion:</span> This applies only on the festival, but not before it.</p>
<p class="bas indent1"><span class="nm">(g)</span><span class="cl">Answer:</span> No. 'The festival' includes the days before it.</p>
<p class="bas indent1"><span class="nm">(h)</span><span class="cl">Support (for Reish Lakish - Beraisa):</span> The Isur (prohibition) to (buy and) sell pertains only to things that will last (until the festival), but not to perishables;</p>
<p class="bas indent2"><span class="nm">1.</span>Even things that will last, if one (bought or) sold, it is permitted.</p>
<p class="bas indent1"><span class="nm">(i)</span><span class="cl">(Rav Zvid - Beraisa):</span> Something that will not last we may sell to Nochrim. We may not buy it (Rashi; R. Tam - accept such a gift) from them.</p>
<p class="bas subject"><span class="nm">5)</span>THINGS THAT WILL MAKE THEM REJOICE</p>
<p class="bas indent1"><span class="nm">(a)</span>On the day of his festival, a Min sent newly minted coins to R. Yehudah Nesi'ah.</p>
<p class="bas indent2"><span class="nm">1.</span><span class="cl">R. Yehudah Nesi'ah:</span> If I accept them, he will thank his idolatry. If I do not accept them, he will bear enmity!</p>
<p class="bas indent2"><span class="nm">2.</span><span class="cl">Reish Lakish:</span> Throw them in a pit when he is watching.</p>
<p class="bas indent2"><span class="nm">3.</span><span class="cl">R. Yehudah Nesi'ah:</span> All the more so, he will bear enmity!</p>
<p class="bas indent2"><span class="nm">4.</span><span class="cl">Reish Lakish:</span> I meant that you should make it look like it was accidental.</p>
<p class="bas indent1"><span class="nm">(b)</span><span class="cl">(Mishnah):</span> One may not lend (objects) to them or borrow from them...</p>
<p class="bas indent1"><span class="nm">(c)</span><span class="cl">Question:</span> Granted, lending is forbidden, due to Harvachah;</p>
<p class="bas indent2"><span class="nm">1.</span>Why is borrowing forbidden? This leaves him with less!</p>
<p class="bas indent1"><span class="nm">(d)</span><span class="cl">Answer #1 (Abaye):</span> We decree not to borrow, less one come to lend.</p>
<p class="bas indent1"><span class="nm">(e)</span><span class="cl">Answer #2 (Rava):</span> The Nochri will rejoice that the Yisrael needs him, and he will thank his idolatry.</p>
<p class="bas indent1"><span class="nm">(f)</span><span class="cl">(Mishnah):</span> One may not lend money to them or borrow from them...</p>
<p class="bas indent1"><span class="nm">(g)</span><span class="cl">Question:</span> Granted, lending is forbidden, due to Harvachah;</p>
<p class="bas indent2"><span class="nm">1.</span>Why is borrowing forbidden? This leaves him with less!</p>
<p class="bas indent1"><span class="nm">(h)</span><span class="cl">Answer #1 (Abaye):</span> We decree not to borrow, less one come to lend.</p>
<p class="bas indent1"><span class="nm">(i)</span><span class="cl">Answer #2 (Rava):</span> The Nochri will rejoice that the Yisrael needs him, he will thank his idolatry.</p>
<p class="bas indent1"><span class="nm">(j)</span><span class="cl">(Mishnah):</span> One may not repay a loan owed to them or collect a loan from them...</p>
<p class="bas indent1"><span class="nm">(k)</span><span class="cl">Question:</span> Granted, repaying is forbidden, due to Harvachah;</p>
<p class="bas indent2"><span class="nm">1.</span>Why is collecting forbidden? This leaves him with less!</p>
<p class="bas indent1"><span class="nm">(l)</span><span class="cl">Answer #1 (Abaye):</span> We decree not to collect, less one repay.</p>
<p class="bas indent1"><span class="nm">(m)</span><span class="cl">Answer #2 (Rava):</span> The Nochri will rejoice that he no longer owes, and he will thank his idolatry.</p>
<p class="bas indent1"><span class="nm">(n)</span>The Mishnah needed to teach all these cases.</p>
<p class="bas indent2"><span class="nm">1.</span>Had it taught only (buying and) selling, one might have thought that he will thank his idolatry due to his Harvachah, but not if we borrow objects; (Tosfos - even Abaye would not decree unless the Nochri rejoices somewhat);</p>
<p class="bas indent2"><span class="nm">2.</span>Had it taught only borrowing objects, one might have thought that this makes him feel important, but borrowing money merely pains him, for he fears lest he not get back his money;</p>
<p class="bas indent2"><span class="nm">3.</span>Had it taught only borrowing money, one might have thought that he is confident that he can force the Yisrael to pay back, and he rejoices now, but collecting causes him only pain.</p>
<p class="bas indent2"><span class="nm">4.</span>We needed to teach that in all cases, he rejoices and will thank his idolatry.</p>
<p class="bas indent1"><span class="nm">(o)</span><span class="cl">(Mishnah - R. Yehudah):</span> One may collect loans from them, for this pains them...</p>
<p class="bas indent1"><span class="nm">(p)</span><span class="cl">Question:</span> Does R. Yehudah really argue with Chachamim, who say that even though it pains them now, it gladdens them later?!</p>
<p class="bas indent2"><span class="nm">1.</span><span class="cl">Contradiction (Beraisa - R. Yehudah):</span> A woman may not put plaster on her face on Chol ha'Mo'ed, for this is repulsive;</p>
<p class="bas indent2"><span class="nm">2.</span>R. Yehudah admits that if she can take it off during the festival it is permitted. Even though it pains her now, it gladdens her later.</p>
<p class="bas indent1"><span class="nm">(q)</span><span class="cl">Answer #1 (Rav Nachman bar Yitzchak):</span> The laws of Chol ha'Mo'ed are an exception. All exertions that are allowed are for the sake of future enjoyment (on the festival).</p>
<p class="bas indent1"><span class="nm">(r)</span><span class="cl">Answer #2 (Ravina):</span> (R. Yehudah holds that) a Nochri is always sad that he paid.</p>
<p class="bas indent1"><span class="nm">(s)</span>Our Mishnah is not like R. Yehoshua ben Korchah.</p>
<p class="bas indent2"><span class="nm">1.</span><span class="cl">(Beraisa - R. Yehoshua ben Korchah):</span> One may not collect (before the festival) a loan from them for which one has a document. He may collect a loan without a document, for this is saving one's money (lest the Nochri deny it later).</p>
