<p class="bas indent1"><span class="nm">(a)</span><span class="cl">Answer #1:</span> This is not difficult for R. Yochanan. (He learns projection of intent from Pigul. I.e. if one did an Avodah with intent to do a later Avodah outside the permitted time (or place, the Korban is Pasul, as if the first Avodah was with Pasul intent. He would not need "Zove'ach..." to teach this. Therefore, it teaches the general rule, and Hishtachava'ah does not.)</p>
<p class="bas indent1"><span class="nm">(b)</span><span class="cl">Question #1:</span> Reish Lakish should learn like Rava suggested, and use "Zove'ach..." to teach projection of intent!</p>
<p class="bas indent1"><span class="nm">(c)</span><span class="cl">Question #2 (Rav Papa):</span> Also R. Yochanan should use "Zove'ach..." to teach projection of intent!</p>
<p class="bas indent2"><span class="nm">1.</span>R. Yochanan forbids the animal, but he did not say that the person (who slaughtered) is liable. Perhaps "Zove'ach..." comes to obligate the person!</p>
<p class="bas indent1"><span class="nm">(d)</span><span class="cl">Answer (to both questions - Rav Acha brei d'Rav Ika):</span> Reish Lakish only permitted the animal, but he (and all the more so, R. Yochanan) obligate the person (even without "Zove'ach");</p>
<p class="bas indent2"><span class="nm">1.</span>This is like one who bows to a mountain. The mountain is permitted, but he is killed.</p>
<p class="bas subject"><span class="nm">2)</span>LIABILITY FOR SERVING IDOLS WITH OTHER <i>AVODOS</i></p>
<p class="bas indent1"><span class="nm">(a)</span><span class="cl">Question (Rav Acha mi'Difti):</span> Rava bar Rav Chanan suggested that Hishtachava'ah should teach that one is liable even for Avodah that is not Avodas Penim. If so, what would "Eichah Ya'avdu... Es Eloheihem" come to exclude? (In truth, "Eichah Ya'avdu" is our source to exempt Avodah that is not Avodas Penim (unless it is the normal Avodah of the idolatry).)</p>
<p class="bas indent2"><span class="nm">1.</span><span class="cl">Suggestion:</span> It excludes excreting in front of an idolatry normally served through Zevichah.</p>
<p class="bas indent2"><span class="nm">2.</span><span class="cl">Rejection:</span> Hishtachava'ah is honorable. We would only learn such Avodah. (There is no need to exclude Avodah of disgrace!)</p>
<p class="bas indent1"><span class="nm">(b)</span><span class="cl">Answer (Abaye):</span> It would exclude excreting in front of Markulis;</p>
<p class="bas indent2"><span class="nm">1.</span>One might have thought that since the normal Avodah of Markulis is disgraceful, one is liable for any disgraceful Avodah. The verse would teach, this is not so.</p>
<p class="bas indent1"><span class="nm">(c)</span><span class="cl">Question:</span> R. Elazar taught that if one slaughters an animal to Markulis, he is liable (even though its normal Avodah is disgraceful) - "v'Lo Yizbechu Od... la'Se'irim."</p>
<p class="bas indent2"><span class="nm">1.</span>We do not need it to teach about its normal Avodah, which we learn from "Eichah Ya'avdu..." Therefore, it teaches about something other than its normal Avodah.</p>
<p class="bas indent2"><span class="nm">2.</span><span class="cl">Summation of question:</span> Hishtachava'ah already teaches about honorable Avodah that is not its normal Avodah!</p>
<p class="bas indent1"><span class="nm">(d)</span><span class="cl">Answer:</span> Hishtachava'ah teaches about when he seeks to please the idolatry. "V'Lo Yizbechu Od" forbids Avodah even to anger the idolatry.</p>
<p class="bas indent1"><span class="nm">(e)</span><span class="cl">Contradiction (Rav Hamnuna):</span> Our Mishnah (60b; we call this Mishnah #1) teaches 'one who <i>serves</i> idolatry (he is Chayav Misah).' He is not liable for just <i>saying</i> that he will serve;</p>
<p class="bas indent2"><span class="nm">1.</span>Mishnah #2 (67a) teaches 'one who <i>says</i> 'I will serve idolatry', or 'let us go serve idolatry' is liable.</p>
<p class="bas indent1"><span class="nm">(f)</span><span class="cl">Answer #1 (Rabah):</span> In Mishnah #1, he does not accept it to be his god until he serves it.</p>
<p class="bas indent1"><span class="nm">(g)</span><span class="cl">Answer #2 (Rav Yosef):</span> The Tana'im of these Mishnayos argue with each other.</p>
<p class="bas indent2"><span class="nm">1.</span><span class="cl">(Beraisa - R. Meir):</span> If one says 'come and worship me', he is liable;</p>
<p class="bas indent2"><span class="nm">2.</span>R. Yehudah exempts. (Tosfos - the entire Sugya discusses when the Nises (the one enticed) is liable. The enticer is always liable. Alternatively, the enticer is liable only when the Nises is liable.)</p>
<p class="bas indent3"><span class="nm">i.</span>All agree that he (the Nises) is liable if he served him - "Lo Sa'aseh Lecha Pesel";</p>
<p class="bas indent3"><span class="nm">ii.</span>They argue about whether he is liable just for speaking. R. Meir obligates, for he holds that speech is significant. R. Yehudah exempts, for he holds that it is insignificant.</p>
<p class="bas indent1"><span class="nm">(h)</span><span class="cl">Retraction (Rav Yosef):</span> I erred. R. Yehudah admits that he is liable for speaking.</p>
<p class="bas indent2"><span class="nm">1.</span><span class="cl">(Beraisa - R. Yehudah):</span> He (the Nises) is not liable until he says 'I will serve', 'I will go and serve idolatry', or 'let us go and serve.'</p>
<p class="bas indent2"><span class="nm">2.</span><span class="cl">Question:</span> What do R. Meir and R. Yehudah argue about?</p>
<p class="bas indent2"><span class="nm">3.</span><span class="cl">Answer:</span> They argue about whether or not enticing to serve oneself is enticement, when others agree to serve him</p>
<p class="bas indent3"><span class="nm">i.</span>R. Meir says that when others agree to serve him, they sincerely agree (so they are liable)</p>
<p class="bas indent3"><span class="nm">ii.</span>R. Yehudah says that they do not intend to serve him. They reason 'he is just a person, like us!'</p>
<p class="bas bbbline">61b----------------------------------------61b</p>
<p class="bas indent3"><span class="nm">iii.</span>They mock him by 'agreeing' to serve him.</p>
<p class="bas indent1"><span class="nm">(i)</span><span class="cl">Answer #3 (Rav Yosef):</span> Mishnah #2 discusses enticing an individual. He will not reconsider, therefore he (the Nises) is liable immediately;</p>
<p class="bas indent2"><span class="nm">1.</span>Mishnah #1 discusses enticing more than one person. They are likely to reconsider, therefore, they are not liable until they serve.</p>
<p class="bas indent1"><span class="nm">(j)</span><span class="cl">Support (Rav Yosef for himself):</span> "Lo Soveh Lo v'Lo Sishma Elav" - if he (an individual) wanted and listened, he is liable.</p>
<p class="bas indent1"><span class="nm">(k)</span><span class="cl">Objection (Abaye):</span> We do not make this distinction between an individual and a group that is enticed!</p>
<p class="bas indent2"><span class="nm">1.</span><span class="cl">(Beraisa):</span> "Ki Yesisecha Achicha Ven Imecha" applies to an individual or a multitude that is enticed;</p>
<p class="bas indent2"><span class="nm">2.</span>The Torah distinguished their punishments. It is stringent about the body of an individual (he is stoned), and it is lenient about his money (it passes to his heirs);</p>
<p class="bas indent3"><span class="nm">i.</span>The Torah is lenient about the bodies of a multitude (if the majority of a city served idolatry, they are choked), and it is stringent about their money (it is destroyed).</p>
<p class="bas indent2"><span class="nm">3.</span><span class="cl">Inference:</span> These are the only differences!</p>
<p class="bas indent1"><span class="nm">(l)</span><span class="cl">Answer #4 (Abaye):</span> Mishnah #1 discusses one who entices himself. He is likely to reconsider, so he is not liable until he serves;</p>
<p class="bas indent2"><span class="nm">1.</span>Mishnah #2 discusses when others entice him. He will not reconsider, therefore he is liable immediately (once he consents);</p>
<p class="bas indent1"><span class="nm">(m)</span><span class="cl">Support (Abaye, for himself):</span> "Lo Soveh Lo v'Lo Sishma <i>Elav</i>" - if he consents to another's enticement, he is liable.</p>
<p class="bas indent1"><span class="nm">(n)</span><span class="cl">Answer #5 (Rava):</span> In both Mishnayos, others entice him;</p>
<p class="bas indent2"><span class="nm">1.</span>If the enticer detailed what the idolatry eats, drinks, rewards and punishes, the Nises is liable once he agrees;</p>
<p class="bas indent2"><span class="nm">2.</span>If the enticer did not give these details, the Nises is not liable until he serves.</p>
<p class="bas indent1"><span class="nm">(o)</span><span class="cl">Support (Rava, for himself):</span> "Me'Elohei... ha'Kerovim Elecha Oh ha'Rechokim";</p>
<p class="bas indent2"><span class="nm">1.</span><span class="cl">Question:</span> What difference is there between idolatry nearby or far away?</p>
<p class="bas indent2"><span class="nm">2.</span><span class="cl">Answer:</span> From the nearby idolatries you can learn about the ones far away. An enticer normally describes what a far away idolatry eats, drinks, rewards and punishes. The Torah tells you that it is no different than the nearby idolatries, which you recognize (that they do nothing).</p>
<p class="bas indent1"><span class="nm">(p)</span><span class="cl">Answer #6 (Rav Ashi):</span> Mishnah #2 discusses a Yisrael Mumar (he will not reconsider, so he is liable once he agrees).</p>
<p class="bas indent1"><span class="nm">(q)</span><span class="cl">Answer #7 (Ravina):</span> Mishnah #2 teaches a bigger Chidush. Not only is one liable for serving, rather, he is liable once he agrees to serve. (Indeed, from Mishnah #2 we can infer the law of Mishnah #1.)</p>
<p class="bas subject"><span class="nm">3)</span>SERVING IDOLATRY OUT OF LOVE OR FEAR</p>
<p class="bas indent1"><span class="nm">(a)</span><span class="cl">(Abaye):</span> If one served idolatry due to love or fear (of a person), he is liable, for in any event he served.</p>
<p class="bas indent1"><span class="nm">(b)</span><span class="cl">(Rava):</span> He is exempt. He is liable only if he accepted it to be his god.</p>
<p class="bas indent1"><span class="nm">(c)</span><span class="cl">Support (Abaye, for himself - Mishnah):</span> The same applies to one who serves...</p>
<p class="bas indent2"><span class="nm">1.</span><span class="cl">Suggestion:</span> This means whether he serves due to love or fear!</p>
<p class="bas indent1"><span class="nm">(d)</span><span class="cl">Rejection (Rava):</span> No. R. Yirmeyah explained that it means whether he did its normal Avodah, or served it through Avodas Penim, even if this is not its normal Avodah.</p>
<p class="bas indent1"><span class="nm">(e)</span><span class="cl">Support (Abaye, for himself - Beraisa):</span> "Lo Sishtachaveh Lahem" (to idols), but you may bow to a person;</p>
<p class="bas indent2"><span class="nm">1.</span><span class="cl">Suggestion:</span> Perhaps you may bow to a person that people serve (like idolatry), like Haman!</p>
<p class="bas indent2"><span class="nm">2.</span><span class="cl">Rejection:</span> "V'Lo So'ovdem."</p>
<p class="bas indent2"><span class="nm">3.</span><span class="cl">(Abaye):</span> People served Haman because they feared Achashverosh, and the Torah considers this idolatry!</p>
<p class="bas indent1"><span class="nm">(f)</span><span class="cl">Rejection (Rava):</span> No. The Torah forbids bowing to someone who resembles Haman in one respect, and not in all respects:</p>
<p class="bas indent2"><span class="nm">1.</span>One may not bow to a person who is served, such as Haman. This is only if people truly intend to serve him, unlike Haman, who was served only out of fear.</p>
<p class="bas indent1"><span class="nm">(g)</span><span class="cl">Support (Abaye, for himself - Beraisa - Rebbi):</span> A Kohen Gadol anointed with the Shemen ha'Mishchah brings a Korban if he served idolatry b'Shogeg;</p>
<p class="bas indent1"><span class="nm">(h)</span>Chachamim say, he is liable only for He'elem Davar (if he erred in Halachah);</p>
<p class="bas indent2"><span class="nm">1.</span>Both agree that when he is liable, he brings a female goat, like a commoner.</p>
<p class="bas indent2"><span class="nm">2.</span>They also agree that he does not bring an Asham Taluy (when in doubt whether he transgressed).</p>
<p class="bas indent2"><span class="nm">3.</span><span class="cl">Question:</span> What is the case of idolatry b'Shogeg?</p>
<p class="bas indent3"><span class="nm">i.</span><span class="cl">Suggestion:</span> He thought that he bows to a synagogue, and it really was idolatry.</p>
<p class="bas indent3"><span class="nm">ii.</span><span class="cl">Rejection:</span> He intended to serve Hash-m! (Surely, he is exempt.)</p>
<p class="bas indent2"><span class="nm">4.</span><span class="cl">Answer #1:</span> Rather, he bowed to a statue in the king's image.</p>
<p class="bas indent2"><span class="nm">5.</span><span class="cl">Rejection:</span> If he accepted it to be his god, he was Mezid (he does not bring a Korban). If he did not accept it to be his god, he did not serve idolatry!</p>
<p class="bas indent2"><span class="nm">6.</span><span class="cl">Answer #2:</span> Rather, he served idolatry due to love or fear. (The Tana'im argue only about whether or not an anointed Kohen is liable if he did not err in Halachah, but all agree that serving due to love or fear is considered idolatry!)</p>
<p class="bas indent2"><span class="nm">7.</span><span class="cl">Answer #3 (and rejection of Abaye's support - Rava):</span> No, he thought that idolatry is permitted.</p>
<p class="bas indent2"><span class="nm">8.</span><span class="cl">Question:</span> That is He'elem Davar (which Chachamim agree about. The argument is about b'Shogeg. This must be a different case)!</p>
<p class="bas indent2"><span class="nm">9.</span><span class="cl">Answer:</span> He thought that idolatry is totally permitted. He'elem Davar is only when he remembers part of the law and forgets part.</p>
