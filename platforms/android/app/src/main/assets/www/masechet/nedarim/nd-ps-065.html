<p class="bas subject"><span class="nm">1)</span>A VOW MADE TO A PERSON</p>
<p class="bas indent1"><span class="nm">(a)</span><span class="cl">(Beraisa):</span> If Reuven vowed not to benefit from Shimon, he may annul his vow only in front of Shimon.</p>
<p class="bas indent1"><span class="nm">(b)</span><span class="cl">Question:</span> What is the source of this?</p>
<p class="bas indent1"><span class="nm">(c)</span><span class="cl">Answer (Rav Nachman):</span> "Hash-m said to Moshe in Midyan 'go return to Mitzrayim, for all the men have died'". Since Moshe vowed in Midyan (to Yisro), he needed to go to Midyan to annul his vow (in front of him).</p>
<p class="bas indent2"><span class="nm">1.</span>"Va'Yo'EL Moshe" - ALah denotes an oath - "(He made a covenant with him) and brought him in an Alah."</p>
<p class="bas indent1"><span class="nm">(d)</span><span class="cl">Question:</span> "He (Tzidkiyahu) also rebelled against Nevuchadnetzar, who made him swear by Hash-m's name." What was his rebellion?</p>
<p class="bas indent1"><span class="nm">(e)</span><span class="cl">Answer:</span> He had seen Nevuchadnetzar eat a live hare. Nevuchadnetzar made him swear not to reveal this.</p>
<p class="bas indent2"><span class="nm">1.</span>Later, it pained Tzidkiyahu to keep the secret. (This disrupted his service of Hash-m.) He permitted his oath and revealed the matter.</p>
<p class="bas indent1"><span class="nm">(f)</span>Nevuchadnetzar heard that people were debasing him for having eaten a live hare. He summoned the Sanhedrin and Tzidkiyahu.</p>
<p class="bas indent2"><span class="nm">1.</span><span class="cl">Nevuchadnetzar:</span> Look what Tzidkiyahu did. I made him swear by Hash-m's name that he will not reveal!</p>
<p class="bas indent2"><span class="nm">2.</span><span class="cl">The Sanhedrin:</span> He permitted his oath.</p>
<p class="bas indent2"><span class="nm">3.</span><span class="cl">Nevuchadnetzar:</span> May one do that?</p>
<p class="bas indent2"><span class="nm">4.</span><span class="cl">The Sanhedrin:</span> Yes.</p>
<p class="bas indent2"><span class="nm">5.</span><span class="cl">Nevuchadnetzar:</span> Must this be in front of the one to whom he swore, or even not in front of him?</p>
<p class="bas indent2"><span class="nm">6.</span><span class="cl">The Sanhedrin:</span> It must be in front of him.</p>
<p class="bas indent2"><span class="nm">7.</span><span class="cl">Nevuchadnetzar:</span> Why did you annul his oath when I was not there?</p>
<p class="bas indent2"><span class="nm">8.</span><span class="cl">(R. Yitzchak):</span> "(The Sanhedrin) sat on the ground; the Chachamim of Tziyon were silent" - the pillows they were sitting on were removed.</p>
<p class="bas subject"><span class="nm">2)</span>BORDERLINE <i>NOLAD</i></p>
<p class="bas indent1"><span class="nm">(a)</span><span class="cl">(Mishnah - R. Meir):</span> There are cases that resemble Nolad, but are not really Nolad;</p>
<p class="bas indent1"><span class="nm">(b)</span>Chachamim argue. (They are truly Nolad.)</p>
<p class="bas indent1"><span class="nm">(c)</span>They argue about cases like the following:</p>
<p class="bas indent2"><span class="nm">1.</span>Levi vowed 'I will not marry Plonis because her father is evil'; and they told him that her father died or repented;</p>
<p class="bas indent2"><span class="nm">2.</span>He vowed 'I will not enter this house, for there is a vicious dog or a snake inside', and they told him that it died.</p>
<p class="bas indent1"><span class="nm">(d)</span><span class="cl">(Gemara) Question:</span> Death is (genuine) Nolad!</p>
<p class="bas indent1"><span class="nm">(e)</span><span class="cl">Answer #1 (Rav Huna):</span> It is as if Levi made his vow contingent (on the father being alive).</p>
<p class="bas indent1"><span class="nm">(f)</span><span class="cl">Answer #2 (R. Yochanan):</span> The case is, he already died or repented before Levi vowed.</p>
<p class="bas bbbline">65b----------------------------------------65b</p>
<p class="bas indent1"><span class="nm">(g)</span><span class="cl">Question (R. Aba - the next Mishnah):</span> If one said 'I will not marry Plonis, because she is ugly', and she is actually pretty, or 'because she is black (or short)', and she is really white (or tall), he is permitted;</p>
<p class="bas indent2"><span class="nm">1.</span>This is not because she was ugly or black or short, and she became pretty or white or tall. Rather, the vow was a mistake from the beginning.</p>
<p class="bas indent2"><span class="nm">2.</span>This is not difficult for Rav Huna. Our Mishnah teaches about making a vow contingent, and the next Mishnah teaches about a mistaken vow.</p>
<p class="bas indent2"><span class="nm">3.</span>But according to R. Yochanan, both our Mishnah and the next Mishnah teach about a mistaken vow! Why are both needed?</p>
<p class="bas indent1"><span class="nm">(h)</span>This is left difficult.</p>
<p class="bas subject"><span class="nm">3)</span>WAYS TO BE <i>POSE'ACH</i></p>
<p class="bas indent1"><span class="nm">(a)</span><span class="cl">(Mishnah - R. Meir):</span> (If Reuven vowed not to benefit from Shimon,) we may be Pose'ach by telling him what the Torah says. We tell him:</p>
<p class="bas indent2"><span class="nm">1.</span>You transgress "do not take vengeance", "do not bear a grudge", "do not hate your brother in your heart" and "love your fellow man like yourself";</p>
<p class="bas indent2"><span class="nm">2.</span>You also transgress "Your brother will live with you". If Shimon will become poor, your vow forbids you to support him!</p>
<p class="bas indent2"><span class="nm">3.</span>Had you known this, would you have vowed?</p>
<p class="bas indent1"><span class="nm">(b)</span>If he says 'had I known this, I would not have vowed', he is permitted.</p>
<p class="bas indent1"><span class="nm">(c)</span><span class="cl">(Gemara - Rav Huna bar Rav Katina) Question:</span> (Why does Reuven transgress "Your brother will live with you"?) It is not incumbent (specifically) on him to support Shimon!</p>
<p class="bas indent2"><span class="nm">1.</span>Reuven and all others must support all the poor! (He will give money to the Tzedakah collector. If he gives that money to Shimon, he benefits Shimon, not Reuven!)</p>
<p class="bas indent1"><span class="nm">(d)</span><span class="cl">Answer (Rabanan):</span> Shimon might request from Reuven before he requests from the Tzedakah collector (and Reuven will transgress then).</p>
<p class="bas indent1"><span class="nm">(e)</span><span class="cl">(Mishnah):</span> We may be Pose'ach by telling a man that he will have to pay his wife's Kesuvah;</p>
<p class="bas indent2"><span class="nm">1.</span>A case occurred in which Reuven was Mudar Hana'ah from his wife. Her Kesuvah was 400 Dinars.</p>
<p class="bas indent2"><span class="nm">2.</span><span class="cl">R. Akiva:</span> You must pay the Kesuvah.</p>
<p class="bas indent2"><span class="nm">3.</span><span class="cl">Reuven:</span> My father left 800 Dinars when he died. I and my brother each received 400. Isn't it enough that my wife takes 200, and I the other 200?!</p>
<p class="bas indent2"><span class="nm">4.</span><span class="cl">R. Akiva:</span> Even if you must sell the hair on your head, you must pay her Kesuvah!</p>
<p class="bas indent2"><span class="nm">5.</span><span class="cl">Reuven:</span> Had I known that, I would not have vowed.</p>
<p class="bas indent2"><span class="nm">6.</span>R. Akiva permitted the vow.</p>
<p class="bas subject"><span class="nm">4)</span>WHAT DO WE TAKE FROM DEBTORS?</p>
<p class="bas indent1"><span class="nm">(a)</span><span class="cl">(Gemara) Question:</span> Is there really a lien on Metaltelim (movable objects, such as money) to pay a Kesuvah?!</p>
<p class="bas indent1"><span class="nm">(b)</span><span class="cl">Answer (Abaye):</span> No. His father left him land worth 800 Dinars.</p>
<p class="bas indent1"><span class="nm">(c)</span><span class="cl">Objection:</span> R. Akiva told him 'even if you must sell your hair ...' This is Metaltelim!</p>
<p class="bas indent1"><span class="nm">(d)</span><span class="cl">Answer:</span> He meant, she will collect her Kesuvah from (all) your land, even if you will be forced to sell your hair in order to eat.</p>
<p class="bas indent1"><span class="nm">(e)</span><span class="cl">Inference:</span> Our Mishnah teaches that when we force a debtor to pay, we do not leave him basic necessities (food and Kelim, therefore, he will need to sell his hair! In Bava Metzia (114a), some say that we are not</p>
<p class="bas indent1"><span class="nm">(f)</span><span class="cl">Rejection (Rav Nachman bar Yitzchak):</span> Perhaps we leave him basic necessities;</p>
<p class="bas indent2"><span class="nm">1.</span>The Mishnah teaches that even if he (goes beyond the letter of the law and) gives all he has now, if this does not fully pay the Kesuvah, we do not tear the Kesuvah. (Whenever he will get more money, he must pay the balance.)</p>
