<p class="bas indent1"><span class="nm">(a)</span><span class="cl">(Gemara) Question:</span> How much must the food roast before Shabbos?</p>
<p class="bas indent1"><span class="nm">(b)</span><span class="cl">Answer (R. Elazar):</span> It must be roasted k'Ma'achal Ben Drusai (like a certain thief used to eat, a third or half cooked).</p>
<p class="bas indent1"><span class="nm">(c)</span><span class="cl">(Rav Asi):</span> The decree against Bishul Akum (food cooked by Nochrim) does not apply to anything cooked [by a Yisrael] k'Ma'achal Ben Drusai (a Nochri may finish cooking it).</p>
<p class="bas indent1"><span class="nm">(d)</span><span class="cl">(Beraisa - Chananya):</span> Anything cooked k'Ma'achal Ben Drusai may be left on a stovetop on Shabbos, even if the stove was not Garuf or Katum (the coals were not swept out, ashes were not put on them - since it is edible, we are not concerned lest he stoke the coals).</p>
<p class="bas indent1"><span class="nm">(e)</span><span class="cl">(Mishnah):</span> One may not put bread...[R. Eliezer requires time for the bottom face to form a crust].</p>
<p class="bas indent1"><span class="nm">(f)</span><span class="cl">Question:</span> Does 'the bottom face' mean the one stuck to the oven (but Chachamim permit once any face crusts), or the one facing the fire (in the bottom of the oven - but Chachamim require all the faces to crust)?</p>
<p class="bas indent1"><span class="nm">(g)</span><span class="cl">Answer (Beraisa - R. Eliezer):</span> There must be time for the bottom face stuck to the oven to form a crust.</p>
<p class="bas indent1"><span class="nm">(h)</span><span class="cl">(Mishnah):</span> We may lower the Korban Pesach...</p>
<p class="bas indent1"><span class="nm">(i)</span><span class="cl">Question:</span> Why is this permitted?</p>
<p class="bas indent1"><span class="nm">(j)</span><span class="cl">Answer:</span> The group that will eat it are zealous.</p>
<p class="bas indent1"><span class="nm">(k)</span><span class="cl">Inference:</span> If they would not be zealous, it would be forbidden.</p>
<p class="bas indent1"><span class="nm">(l)</span><span class="cl">Question:</span> But we learned (18B) that one may leave kid meat even in an unsealed oven (according to everyone (Version #2), or at least according to Rav Ashi in Version #1)!</p>
<p class="bas indent1"><span class="nm">(m)</span><span class="cl">Answer:</span> It is permitted there when the kid is cut into pieces (wind is bad for it) - Korban Pesach is roasted whole (wind does not harm it).</p>
<p class="bas subject"><span class="nm">2)</span>HOW MUCH MUST FIRE BURN BEFORE SHABBOS?</p>
<p class="bas indent1"><span class="nm">(a)</span><span class="cl">(Mishnah):</span> It suffices for the bonfire [in the Beis ha'Mokad to catch a little].</p>
<p class="bas indent1"><span class="nm">(b)</span><span class="cl">Question:</span> What is the source of this?</p>
<p class="bas indent1"><span class="nm">(c)</span><span class="cl">Answer #1 (Rav Huna):</span> "Lo Seva'aru Esh b'Chol Moshvoseichem" - you may not kindle in your dwellings, it is permitted in Beis ha'Mokad (a chamber in the Mikdash in which a fire burned).</p>
<p class="bas indent1"><span class="nm">(d)</span><span class="cl">Objection (Rav Chisda):</span> If so, it should be permitted even on Shabbos! Rather, the verse permits burning limbs [of Olos] and Chelev on the Mizbe'ach [on Shabbos].</p>
<p class="bas indent1"><span class="nm">(e)</span><span class="cl">Answer #2 (Rav Chisda):</span> It is permitted because Kohanim are zealous.</p>
<p class="bas indent1"><span class="nm">(f)</span><span class="cl">(Mishnah):</span> Outside the Mikdash, [most of the wood must catch].</p>
<p class="bas indent1"><span class="nm">(g)</span><span class="cl">Question:</span> What majority is required?</p>
<p class="bas indent1"><span class="nm">(h)</span><span class="cl">Answer #1 (Rav):</span> The majority of each stick must catch fire.</p>
<p class="bas indent1"><span class="nm">(i)</span><span class="cl">Answer #2 (Shmuel):</span> [The majority of the wood must catch fire,] in order that people will not say 'Bring twigs to put under the logs [to help them catch]'.</p>
<p class="bas indent1"><span class="nm">(j)</span><span class="cl">Support (for Shmuel - Rav Chiya - Beraisa):</span> [When lighting a bonfire before Shabbos (alternatively - the Menorah in the Mikdash),] the flame must go up by itself without anything to help it.</p>
<p class="bas indent1"><span class="nm">(k)</span><span class="cl">Version #1 (Rav):</span> If one burns a single log, the majority of its thickness must catch before Shabbos;</p>
<p class="bas indent1"><span class="nm">(l)</span><span class="cl">Version #2 (Rav):</span> The majority of its circumference must catch.</p>
<p class="bas indent1"><span class="nm">(m)</span><span class="cl">(Rav Papa):</span> Since we are unsure which Rav said, both majorities are required.</p>
<p class="bas indent1"><span class="nm">(n)</span>Tana'im argue like the two versions of Rav:</p>
<p class="bas indent2"><span class="nm">1.</span><span class="cl">(Beraisa - R. Chiya):</span> The log must be so burnt that a craftsman cannot use it (most of its thickness);</p>
<p class="bas indent2"><span class="nm">2.</span>R. Yehudah ben Beseira says, the fire must catch on both sides (most of its circumference).</p>
<p class="bas indent2"><span class="nm">3.</span>There is a hint to this, not a proof - "Es Shnei Ketzosav Ochlah ha'Esh v'Socho Nochar ha'Yitzlach li'Mlachah".</p>
<p class="bas indent1"><span class="nm">(o)</span><span class="cl">Question:</span> "V'Es ha'Ach Lefanav Mevo'ares" - what is this?</p>
<p class="bas indent1"><span class="nm">(p)</span><span class="cl">Answer #1 (Rav):</span> It is a willow branch.</p>
<p class="bas indent1"><span class="nm">(q)</span><span class="cl">Answer #2 (Shmuel):</span> They are logs that caught fire from the willow.</p>
<p class="bas indent1"><span class="nm">(r)</span>A certain man was saying 'Who wants Achvana' - he was found to be selling willow.</p>
<p class="bas subject"><span class="nm">3)</span>THINGS THAT DO NOT REQUIRE A MAJORITY</p>
<p class="bas indent1"><span class="nm">(a)</span><span class="cl">(Rav Huna):</span> In a bonfire of reeds, one need not ignite the majority before Shabbos (for they do not extinguish);</p>
<p class="bas indent2"><span class="nm">1.</span>If he bound them, the majority is required.</p>
<p class="bas indent2"><span class="nm">2.</span>In a fire of pits, the majority is not required; if they are in a Kli made from Lulavim, the majority is required (for the flame does not get inside).</p>
<p class="bas indent1"><span class="nm">(b)</span><span class="cl">Objection (Rav Chisda):</span> Just the contrary! Loose reeds or seeds will come apart (they will not ignite each other, so the majority is needed); bound reeds or seeds in a Kli will not come apart (the majority is not needed).</p>
<p class="bas bbbline">20b----------------------------------------20b</p>
<p class="bas indent1"><span class="nm">(c)</span>Rav Kahana taught like Rav Chisda.</p>
<p class="bas indent1"><span class="nm">(d)</span><span class="cl">(Rav Yosef - Beraisa):</span> Four kinds of bonfire do not require the majority - of pitch, sulfur, wax, and Revav (anything that melts, e.g. wax or fat).</p>
<p class="bas indent1"><span class="nm">(e)</span><span class="cl">(Beraisa):</span> Also fires of straw or stubble do not require the majority.</p>
<p class="bas indent1"><span class="nm">(f)</span><span class="cl">(R. Yochanan):</span> Trees of Bavel do not require the majority.</p>
<p class="bas indent1"><span class="nm">(g)</span><span class="cl">Question (Rav Yosef):</span> What does R. Yochanan refer to?</p>
<p class="bas indent1"><span class="nm">(h)</span><span class="cl">Answer #1:</span> He refers to finely cut wood.</p>
<p class="bas indent1"><span class="nm">(i)</span><span class="cl">Rejection:</span> Ula taught that even a wick (made from worn clothing and dipped in oil, it catches easily) requires the majority, all the more so finely cut wood!</p>
<p class="bas indent1"><span class="nm">(j)</span><span class="cl">Answer #2 (Rav Yosef):</span> He refers to cedar branches.</p>
<p class="bas indent1"><span class="nm">(k)</span><span class="cl">Answer #2 (Rami bar Aba):</span> He refers to moss.</p>

<p class="bas subject"><span class="nm">4)</span>FORBIDDEN WICKS AND OILS</p>
<p class="bas indent1"><span class="nm">(a)</span><span class="cl">(Mishnah) Question:</span> What may be used to light [a lamp that will burn on Shabbos], which are forbidden [because they do not burn nicely, one may come to help it burn]?</p>
<p class="bas indent1"><span class="nm">(b)</span><span class="cl">Answer:</span> We may not use the following - Leches, Chosen, Chalach, Idan wick, wilderness wick or 'yellow on the water';</p>
<p class="bas indent1"><span class="nm">(c)</span>We may not use pitch, wax, Kik oil, oil that must be burned (e.g. Tamei Terumah), the fat tail (of a sheep), or Chelev;</p>
<p class="bas indent2"><span class="nm">1.</span>Nachum ha'Midi permits cooked Chelev;</p>
<p class="bas indent2"><span class="nm">2.</span>Chachamim forbid it, whether or not it is cooked.</p>
<p class="bas indent1"><span class="nm">(d)</span><span class="cl">(Gemara):</span> Leches is a cedar branch.</p>
<p class="bas indent1"><span class="nm">(e)</span><span class="cl">Objection:</span> Obviously, this is not fit for a wick!</p>
<p class="bas indent1"><span class="nm">(f)</span><span class="cl">Answer:</span> The Mishnah forbids a material like wool between the bark and the wood.</p>
<p class="bas indent1"><span class="nm">(g)</span><span class="cl">(Mishnah):</span> Not with Chosen.</p>
<p class="bas indent1"><span class="nm">(h)</span><span class="cl">(Rav Yosef):</span> This is Ne'ores (chaff) of flax.</p>
<p class="bas indent1"><span class="nm">(i)</span><span class="cl">Objection (Abaye):</span> "V'Hayah he'Chason li'N'ores" (this implies that Chosen is not Ne'ores)!</p>
<p class="bas indent1"><span class="nm">(j)</span><span class="cl">(Abaye):</span> Rather, it is flax that was beaten but not unraveled.</p>
<p class="bas indent1"><span class="nm">(k)</span><span class="cl">(Mishnah):</span> Not with Chalach.</p>
<p class="bas indent1"><span class="nm">(l)</span><span class="cl">(Shmuel):</span> Seafarers told me that it is called Chulcha.</p>
<p class="bas indent1"><span class="nm">(m)</span><span class="cl">(Rav Yitzchak bar Ze'ira):</span> This is waste silk.</p>
<p class="bas indent1"><span class="nm">(n)</span>Ravin and Abaye were sitting in front of Ravna Nechemyah, the brother of the Reish Galusa; they saw that he was wearing a silk garment.</p>
<p class="bas indent1"><span class="nm">(o)</span><span class="cl">(Ravin):</span> That is Chalach of the Mishnah!</p>
<p class="bas indent1"><span class="nm">(p)</span><span class="cl">Version #1 - Ri - (Abaye):</span> We (in Bavel) call this Pranda silk (but Chalach is inferior silk).</p>
<p class="bas indent1"><span class="nm">(q)</span><span class="cl">Question (against Ravin - Beraisa):</span> Tzitzis must be put on garments of the following materials - silk, Chalach and Serikin (frayed silk). (This shows that Chalach is not silk!)</p>
<p class="bas indent1"><span class="nm">(r)</span>Ravin is refuted.</p>
<p class="bas indent1"><span class="nm">(s)</span><span class="cl">Version #2 - R. Tam - (Abaye):</span> We call it (Chalach) Pranda silk (Ravna is wearing inferior silk).</p>
<p class="bas indent1"><span class="nm">(t)</span><span class="cl">Question (against Abaye - Beraisa):</span> Tzitzis must be put on garments of the following materials - silk, Chalach and Serikin.</p>
<p class="bas indent1"><span class="nm">(u)</span>Abaye is refuted. (end of Version #2)</p>
<p class="bas indent1"><span class="nm">(v)</span><span class="cl">Answer:</span> Alternatively, Pranda silk is not regular silk.</p>
<p class="bas subject"><span class="nm">5)</span>OTHER FORBIDDEN WICKS</p>
<p class="bas indent1"><span class="nm">(a)</span><span class="cl">(Mishnah):</span> Not with Idan wick.</p>
<p class="bas indent1"><span class="nm">(b)</span>This is [a wick made from] a material like wool between the bark and the wood of willow.</p>
<p class="bas indent1"><span class="nm">(c)</span>Ravin and Abaye were walking in a certain valley and saw willow.</p>
<p class="bas indent1"><span class="nm">(d)</span><span class="cl">Ravin:</span> This is Idan of the Mishnah!</p>
<p class="bas indent1"><span class="nm">(e)</span><span class="cl">Abaye:</span> It is a mere tree (it cannot be used for a wick)!</p>
<p class="bas indent1"><span class="nm">(f)</span>Ravin peeled it and showed him the 'wool' under the bark.</p>
<p class="bas indent1"><span class="nm">(g)</span><span class="cl">(Mishnah):</span> Wilderness wick.</p>
<p class="bas indent1"><span class="nm">(h)</span>This is nettles.</p>
<p class="bas indent1"><span class="nm">(i)</span><span class="cl">(Mishnah):</span> Yellow on the water.</p>
<p class="bas indent1"><span class="nm">(j)</span><span class="cl">Question:</span> What is this?</p>
<p class="bas indent2"><span class="nm">1.</span><span class="cl">Suggestion:</span> It is seaweed.</p>
<p class="bas indent2"><span class="nm">2.</span><span class="cl">Rejection:</span> Seaweed crumbles, one could not make a wick from it!</p>
<p class="bas indent1"><span class="nm">(k)</span><span class="cl">Answer (Rav Papa):</span> It is moss that grows on boats.</p>
<p class="bas indent1"><span class="nm">(l)</span><span class="cl">(Beraisa):</span> They also forbade wicks of wool and hair.</p>
<p class="bas indent1"><span class="nm">(m)</span>Our Tana did not bother to list these, for they do not work at all - wool shrivels up, hair gets burned.</p>
