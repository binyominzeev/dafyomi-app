<p class="bas subject"><span class="nm">1)</span>CLOSING OPENINGS</p>
<p class="bas indent1"><span class="nm">(a)</span><span class="cl">Support (Abaye - Beraisa):</span> A sealed house (i.e. the opening was sealed) receives four Amos when dividing a Chatzer;</p>
<p class="bas indent2"><span class="nm">1.</span>If he removed the doorposts and lintel, it does not receive four Amos.</p>
<p class="bas indent1"><span class="nm">(b)</span>If Tum'as Mes is inside a sealed house, only the (interior and) doorway becomes Tamei;</p>
<p class="bas indent2"><span class="nm">1.</span>If he removed the doorposts and lintel, all around the house is Tamei.</p>
<p class="bas indent1"><span class="nm">(c)</span><span class="cl">(Rabah bar bar Chanah):</span> If Mavo'os are open to a road leading to another city, and people of this city want to close them, people of the other city can stop them.</p>
<p class="bas indent2"><span class="nm">1.</span>This is not only if there is no other path between the cities. Rather, it is even if there is another path, due to Rav Yehudah's law.</p>
<p class="bas indent2"><span class="nm">2.</span><span class="cl">(Rav Yehudah):</span> One may not ruin a path that the public has been using.</p>
<p class="bas indent1"><span class="nm">(d)</span><span class="cl">(Rav Anan):</span> If a Mavuy is open to the Reshus ha'Rabim, and people of the Mavuy want to put doors there, people of the city can stop them.</p>
<p class="bas indent1"><span class="nm">(e)</span><span class="cl">Assumption:</span> This is forbidden only within four Amos of the Reshus ha'Rabim, due to R. Zeira's law.</p>
<p class="bas indent2"><span class="nm">1.</span><span class="cl">(R. Zeira):</span> The four Amos adjacent to the Reshus ha'Rabim are like the Reshus ha'Rabim.</p>
<p class="bas indent1"><span class="nm">(f)</span><span class="cl">Rejection:</span> No. R. Zeira discusses what is considered a Reshus ha'Rabim regarding Safek Tum'ah;</p>
<p class="bas indent2"><span class="nm">1.</span>Rav Anan's law is because sometimes the Reshus ha'Rabim is crowded and people enter the Mavuy, even past four Amos.</p>
<p class="bas subject"><span class="nm">2)</span>THE SHARE THAT EACH PARTNER MUST GET</p>
<p class="bas indent1"><span class="nm">(a)</span><span class="cl">(Mishnah):</span> We divide a field only if each will get (an area fitting to sow) nine Kavim. (R. Yehudah says, it suffices if each gets half this amount.)</p>
<p class="bas indent1"><span class="nm">(b)</span>The Tana'im do not argue. Each discusses the smallest area considered a field in his region.</p>
<p class="bas indent1"><span class="nm">(c)</span><span class="cl">Question:</span> What is the Halachah in Bavel?</p>
<p class="bas indent1"><span class="nm">(d)</span><span class="cl">Answer (Rav Yosef):</span> It is the amount one plows in a day.</p>
<p class="bas indent2"><span class="nm">1.</span><span class="cl">Question:</span> To which plowing does he refer?</p>
<p class="bas indent3"><span class="nm">i.</span>If it is Zara (plowing at the time of sowing, which is easier than Karva, when the field is unseeded), then Karva will takes more than one day but less than two days! (It is wasteful if one must hire workers or rent animals for part of a day.)</p>
<p class="bas indent3"><span class="nm">ii.</span>If it is Karva, then Zara will take less than one day (which is wasteful, like above)!</p>
<p class="bas indent2"><span class="nm">2.</span><span class="cl">Version #1- Answer #1:</span> (Zara takes one day.) He discusses a place where they plow and replow when doing Karva, so this takes two days. (Rashi; Tosfos - in any place, the remainder of the second day of Karva can be spent replowing, it is not wasteful.)</p>
<p class="bas indent2"><span class="nm">3.</span><span class="cl">Answer #2:</span> The case is, the ground is hard, Zara and Karva require the same amount of time.</p>
<p class="bas indent2"><span class="nm">4.</span><span class="cl">Version #2 - Rashi - Answer #1:</span> (Zara takes one day); the case is, the ground is hard, so it takes two full days for Karva;</p>
<p class="bas indent2"><span class="nm">5.</span><span class="cl">Answer #2:</span> He refers to a place where they plow and replow when doing Zara, so Zara and Karva require the same amount of time. (end of Version #2)</p>
<p class="bas indent1"><span class="nm">(e)</span><span class="cl">(Rav Nachman):</span> If a field is irrigated from a pit, each must get a share (Rashi - of the pit; R. Chananel - of land) that requires one day's labor for irrigation.</p>
<p class="bas indent1"><span class="nm">(f)</span><span class="cl">(Shmuel's father):</span> When dividing an orchard, each must get (an area fitting to sow) three Kavim.</p>
<p class="bas indent2"><span class="nm">1.</span><span class="cl">Support (Beraisa - Sumchus):</span> If one says 'I sell to you a portion in a vineyard', he must give three Kavim;</p>
<p class="bas indent2"><span class="nm">2.</span>R. Yosi says, this has no basis!</p>
<p class="bas indent1"><span class="nm">(g)</span><span class="cl">Question:</span> What is the law in Bavel?</p>
<p class="bas indent1"><span class="nm">(h)</span><span class="cl">Answer (Rava bar Kisna):</span> Each must give three groups of 12 trees, this requires a full day to hoe.</p>
<p class="bas subject"><span class="nm">3)</span>THE REMNANTS OF PROPHECY</p>
<p class="bas indent1"><span class="nm">(a)</span><span class="cl">(Rav Avdimi of Cheifah):</span> After the Churban, prophecy was taken from the Nevi'im and given to Chachamim.</p>
<p class="bas indent1"><span class="nm">(b)</span><span class="cl">Objection:</span> Are Chachamim unfit to be Nevi'im?!</p>
<p class="bas indent1"><span class="nm">(c)</span><span class="cl">Answer:</span> He means, even though prophecy was taken from the Nevi'im, it was not taken from Chachamim.</p>
<p class="bas indent1"><span class="nm">(d)</span><span class="cl">(Ameimar):</span> A Chacham is better than a Navi - "v'Navi Levav Chachmah";</p>
<p class="bas indent2"><span class="nm">1.</span>We attribute a smaller matter to a greater matter (i.e. a Navi has a smaller heart than a Chacham).</p>
<p class="bas indent1"><span class="nm">(e)</span><span class="cl">Support #1 (Abaye):</span> We see that Chachamim still have prophecy. Different Chachamim often (independently) say the same Halachah!</p>
<p class="bas indent1"><span class="nm">(f)</span><span class="cl">Objection (Rava):</span> That is no proof of prophecy. Perhaps they have the same Mazel (therefore, they reach the same Halachah)!</p>
<p class="bas indent1"><span class="nm">(g)</span><span class="cl">Support #2 (Rava):</span> Rather, we learn from the fact that a Chacham sometimes says something that R. Akiva taught (we cannot attribute this to having the same Mazel. R. Akiva was much greater!)</p>
<p class="bas bbbline">12b----------------------------------------12b</p>
<p class="bas indent1"><span class="nm">(h)</span><span class="cl">Objection (Rav Ashi):</span> That is no proof. Perhaps regarding that teaching, they have the same Mazel!</p>
<p class="bas indent1"><span class="nm">(i)</span><span class="cl">Support #3 (Rav Ashi):</span> Rather, we learn from the fact that a Chacham sometimes says a Halachah that is a tradition from Moshe from Sinai.</p>
<p class="bas indent1"><span class="nm">(j)</span><span class="cl">Question:</span> Perhaps he merely guessed the law!</p>
<p class="bas indent1"><span class="nm">(k)</span><span class="cl">Answer:</span> When he gives a reason, we cannot say he merely guessed. (Rather, we must say that he Hash-m helped him reach the Halachah, akin to prophecy.)</p>
<p class="bas indent1"><span class="nm">(l)</span><span class="cl">(R. Yochanan):</span> After the Churban, prophecy was taken from the Nevi'im and given to lunatics and children.</p>
<p class="bas indent1"><span class="nm">(m)</span><span class="cl">Question:</span> What is the case of lunatics with prophecy?</p>
<p class="bas indent1"><span class="nm">(n)</span><span class="cl">Answer:</span> It is like the following.</p>
<p class="bas indent2"><span class="nm">1.</span>Mar bar Rav Ashi was in the market; he heard a lunatic saying that the (new) head of the academy in Masa Machsiya signs his name 'Tivyomi' (this is how Mar bar Rav Ashi used to sign; he realized that Hash-m wanted him to be the head). He headed there; before he arrived, the Rabanan voted that Rav Acha mi'Difti would be the head. When they heard that Mar bar Rav Ashi was coming, they sent two messengers to ask his opinion.</p>
<p class="bas indent2"><span class="nm">2.</span>Mar bar Rav Ashi detained the messengers; they sent two more, and Mar bar Rav Ashi kept detaining them until there were ten; he then started expounding (and they chose him to be the head).</p>
<p class="bas indent3"><span class="nm">i.</span>He waited for ten, for we do not teach laws at Kalah with less than ten Talmidim.</p>
<p class="bas indent2"><span class="nm">3.</span><span class="cl">Rav Acha mi'Difti:</span> When Hash-m starts acting harshly to a person (such as myself, I was not made the head), He is not quick to reverse this. When Hash-m starts bestowing good to a person (such as Mar bar Rav Ashi), He is not quick to reverse this.</p>
<p class="bas indent1"><span class="nm">(o)</span><span class="cl">Question:</span> What is the case of children with prophecy?</p>
<p class="bas indent1"><span class="nm">(p)</span><span class="cl">Answer:</span> It is like the case of Rav Chisda's daughter.</p>
<p class="bas indent2"><span class="nm">1.</span>Rava and Rami bar Chama were in front of Rav Chisda and his daughter. Rav Chisda asked her which she wants to marry. She said that she wants to marry both.</p>
<p class="bas indent2"><span class="nm">2.</span><span class="cl">Rava:</span> I will marry her after you. (And so it came to pass. Maharsha - Rami bar Chama holds that it is improper to marry a divorcee, so he did not suggest being last, lest this be like a curse that Rava die.)</p>
<p class="bas indent1"><span class="nm">(q)</span><span class="cl">(Rav Avdimi of Cheifah):</span> Before one eats, he has two hearts (he is indecisive). After eating, he has only one - "v'Ish Navuv Yilavev" (a hollow person (i.e. before eating) has two hearts);</p>
<p class="bas indent2"><span class="nm">1.</span>Also, it says (about the Altar) "Nevuv Luchos", which is translated 'Chalil Luchin (hollow inside the boards)';</p>
<p class="bas indent1"><span class="nm">(r)</span><span class="cl">(Rav Huna brei d'Rav Yehoshua):</span> Drinking wine regularly opens even a blocked heart - "V'Sirosh Yenovev Besulos".</p>
<p class="bas subject"><span class="nm">4)</span>RECEIVING ADJACENT FIELDS</p>
<p class="bas indent1"><span class="nm">(a)</span><span class="cl">(Rav Huna brei d'Rav Yehoshua):</span> Obviously, we give a firstborn his normal and extra portion next to one another.</p>
<p class="bas indent1"><span class="nm">(b)</span><span class="cl">Question:</span> Do we do this for a Yavam (who also inherits his brother's portion)?</p>
<p class="bas indent1"><span class="nm">(c)</span><span class="cl">Answer #1 (Abaye):</span> The law is just the same.</p>
<p class="bas indent2"><span class="nm">1.</span><span class="cl">Question:</span> What is Abaye's reason?</p>
<p class="bas indent2"><span class="nm">2.</span><span class="cl">Answer:</span> The Torah calls a Yavam "Bechor" (a firstborn) to teach this law.</p>
<p class="bas indent1"><span class="nm">(d)</span><span class="cl">Answer #2 (Rava):</span> "V'Hayah ha'Bechor" - he is like a firstborn to get a double portion, but not to receive them together.</p>
<p class="bas indent1"><span class="nm">(e)</span>Reuven bought land bordering his father's land. His father died, and Reuven requested the portion bordering the land he bought.</p>
<p class="bas indent1"><span class="nm">(f)</span><span class="cl">(Rabah):</span> In a case like this, Kofin Al Midas Sedom (we force one to benefit others if he himself will not lose).</p>
<p class="bas indent1"><span class="nm">(g)</span><span class="cl">Objection (Rav Yosef):</span> The brothers can say 'that land is worth more' (whoever wants it will receive a smaller amount).</p>
<p class="bas indent2"><span class="nm">1.</span>The Halachah follows Rav Yosef.</p>
<p class="bas indent1"><span class="nm">(h)</span><span class="cl">(Rabah):</span> If there are two fields, and each borders on a river, Kofin Al Midas Sedom. (Reuven can demand the field bordering his land. Since each field has enough water, Shimon (his brother) cannot claim that he prefers that one.)</p>
<p class="bas indent1"><span class="nm">(i)</span><span class="cl">Objection (Rav Yosef):</span> Perhaps one river will dry up! Shimon can demand half of each field.</p>
<p class="bas indent2"><span class="nm">1.</span>The Halachah follows Rav Yosef.</p>
<p class="bas indent1"><span class="nm">(j)</span><span class="cl">(Rav Yosef):</span> If both fields border on the same river, Kofin Al Midas Sedom.</p>
<p class="bas indent1"><span class="nm">(k)</span><span class="cl">Question (Abaye):</span> Shimon can say 'I prefer that your fields be disconnected, so you will need a sharecropper for each, so my property will be guarded better!'</p>
<p class="bas indent2"><span class="nm">1.</span>The Halachah follows Rav Yosef. We do not honor such a request.</p>
