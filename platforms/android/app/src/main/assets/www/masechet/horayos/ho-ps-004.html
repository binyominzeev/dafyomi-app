<p class="bas subject"><span class="nm">1)</span>LIABILITY OF ONE WHO TRANSGRESSED AFTER BEIS DIN RETRACTED</p>
<p class="bas indent1"><span class="nm">(a)</span><span class="cl">(R. Yochanan):</span> R. Eliezer and Sumchus argue about whether he brings Asham Taluy:</p>
<p class="bas indent1"><span class="nm">(b)</span><span class="cl">(R. Zeira):</span> R. Eliezer compares this to a man who is unsure if he ate Chelev or permitted fat. He brings an Asham Taluy;</p>
<p class="bas indent2"><span class="nm">1.</span>This is not only like the opinion that the Tzibur brings the Korban, so (due to the collection) the mistake becomes known;</p>
<p class="bas indent2"><span class="nm">2.</span>Rather, it is even like the opinion that Beis Din brings it. Had he asked, he would have heard.</p>
<p class="bas indent1"><span class="nm">(c)</span><span class="cl">(R. Yosi bar Avin):</span> Sumchus compares this to a man who transgressed, and offered his Korban Bein ha'Shemashos (twilight. It is a Safek whether it is day or night.)</p>
<p class="bas indent2"><span class="nm">1.</span>If it was still day, he fulfilled his obligation. If it was night, he did not. He is in doubt, but he does not brings an Asham Taluy,</p>
<p class="bas indent2"><span class="nm">2.</span>This is not only like the opinion that Beis Din brings the Korban, so the mistake does not become known;</p>
<p class="bas indent2"><span class="nm">3.</span>Rather, it is even like the opinion that the Tzibur brings. He is exempt, for he acted according to the Hora'ah. He did not think to ask why a Korban was brought.</p>
<p class="bas indent1"><span class="nm">(d)</span><span class="cl">(Mishnah - Ben Azai):</span> What is the difference whether he was at home or travelling?</p>
<p class="bas indent1"><span class="nm">(e)</span><span class="cl">Question:</span> Why does Ben Azai argue? R. Akiva gave a fine answer (someone at home could have asked if Beis Din retracted)!</p>
<p class="bas indent1"><span class="nm">(f)</span><span class="cl">Answer (Rava):</span> They argue about one who started to travel</p>
<p class="bas indent2"><span class="nm">1.</span>Ben Azai obligates, because he is still inside his house (Rashi - the city);</p>
<p class="bas indent2"><span class="nm">2.</span>R. Akiva exempts, because he is occupied with his journey, therefore he did not ask.</p>
<p class="bas subject"><span class="nm">2)</span>UPROOTING PART OF A <i>MITZVAH</i></p>
<p class="bas indent1"><span class="nm">(a)</span><span class="cl">(Mishnah):</span> If the Hora'ah totally uprooted a Mitzvah...</p>
<p class="bas indent1"><span class="nm">(b)</span><span class="cl">(Beraisa):</span> "V'Nelam Davar" excludes when the entire Mitzvah was uprooted:</p>
<p class="bas indent2"><span class="nm">1.</span><span class="cl">Suggestion:</span> If Beis Din said that the Torah does not forbid Nidah or Melachah on Shabbos or idolatry, they are liable.</p>
<p class="bas indent2"><span class="nm">2.</span><span class="cl">Rejection:</span> "V'Nelam Davar", but if the entire Mitzvah was uprooted, they are exempt;</p>
<p class="bas indent2"><span class="nm">3.</span><span class="cl">Suggestion:</span> In the following cases, they are exempt: they forbade Nidah, but exempted one who has relations with a Shomeres Yom k'Neged Yom; they forbade Melachah on Shabbos, but exempted one who transfers from Reshus ha'Yachid to Reshus ha'Rabim), or if they forbade idolatry, but exempted one who bows.</p>
<p class="bas indent2"><span class="nm">4.</span><span class="cl">Rejection:</span> "V'Nelam Davar" - they are liable for permitting part of a Mitzvah.</p>
<p class="bas indent1"><span class="nm">(c)</span><span class="cl">Question:</span> The Tana said that Beis Din is exempt if they uprooted the entire Mitzvah, then suggested that they are exempt for uprooting part. If so, when would they be liable?!</p>
<p class="bas indent1"><span class="nm">(d)</span><span class="cl">Answer:</span> The Tana thought that "Davar" connotes (uprooting) the entire Mitzvah, so they should be liable totally uprooting, and exempt for uprooting part.</p>
<p class="bas indent1"><span class="nm">(e)</span><span class="cl">Question:</span> The Tana answered "v'Nelam Davar." How does this imply part of a Mitzvah?</p>
<p class="bas indent1"><span class="nm">(f)</span><span class="cl">Answer #1 (Ula):</span> We read it as if the 'Mem' of "v'Nelam" was also part of the word "Davar", making 'mi'Davar' (part of a matter).</p>
<p class="bas indent1"><span class="nm">(g)</span><span class="cl">Answer #2 (Chizkiyah):</span> "V'Asu Achas <i>mi'Kol</i> Mitzvos" - not the entire Mitzvah.</p>
<p class="bas indent2"><span class="nm">1.</span><span class="cl">Question:</span> "Mitzvos" is plural. "Achas mi'Kol Mitzvos" refers to one of them!</p>
<p class="bas indent2"><span class="nm">2.</span><span class="cl">Answer (Rav Nachman bar Yitzchak):</span> (We expound according to the way) it is written. It is written "Mitzvas" (singular).</p>
<p class="bas indent1"><span class="nm">(h)</span><span class="cl">Answer #3 (Rav Ashi):</span> We learn from a Gezerah Shavah "Davar-Davar" from Zaken Mamrei:</p>
<p class="bas indent2"><span class="nm">1.</span>Regarding Zaken Mamrei it says "Ki Yipalei... Lo Sasur <i>Min</i> ha'Davar." Just like there, he is liable for uprooting part, also Beis Din is liable for this.</p>
<p class="bas subject"><span class="nm">3)</span>LAWS THAT THE <i>TZEDUKIM</i> AGREE TO</p>
<p class="bas indent1"><span class="nm">(a)</span><span class="cl">(Rav Yehudah):</span> Beis Din is liable only if they permitted something that the Tzedukim (who do not rely on our Oral tradition) permit. If the Tzedukim know that it is forbidden, Beis Din is exempt.</p>
<p class="bas indent2"><span class="nm">1.</span><span class="cl">Question:</span> What is the reason?</p>
<p class="bas indent2"><span class="nm">2.</span><span class="cl">Answer:</span> Such a law is explicit in the Torah. People should not have relied on the Hora'ah.</p>
<p class="bas indent1"><span class="nm">(b)</span><span class="cl">Question #1 (Mishnah):</span> (If Beis Din) forbade Nidah, but exempted one who has relations with a Shomeres Yom k'Neged Yom (they are liable);</p>
<p class="bas indent2"><span class="nm">1.</span>This is explicit in the Torah! "V'Sofrah Lah" - she must count one day (without seeing blood, and refrain from relations on the day) corresponding to a day that she sees blood (during the days of Zivah! Tosfos ha'Rosh - it was known that the Tzedukim admit to this, for "Lah" is extra. R. Chananel, Tosfos - the correct text learns this law from "Mishkav Nidasah Yihyeh Lah.")</p>
<p class="bas indent1"><span class="nm">(c)</span><span class="cl">Answer #1:</span> Beis Din permitted Ha'ara'ah (the first stage of Bi'ah (relations)) and forbade full Bi'ah (with a Shomeres Yom).</p>
<p class="bas indent1"><span class="nm">(d)</span><span class="cl">Objection:</span> Also this is explicit in the Torah - "Es Mekorah He'erah" (forbids Ha'ara'ah)!</p>
<p class="bas indent1"><span class="nm">(e)</span><span class="cl">Answer #2:</span> Beis Din permitted Bi'ah Lo k'Darkah (Bi'ah in the anus) and forbade normal Bi'ah.</p>
<p class="bas indent1"><span class="nm">(f)</span><span class="cl">Objection:</span> Also this is explicit in the Torah - "Mishkevei Ishah" (both kinds of Bi'ah have the same law)!</p>
<p class="bas indent1"><span class="nm">(g)</span><span class="cl">Answer #3:</span> Beis Din permitted Ha'ara'ah of Lo k'Darkah, and forbade even Ha'ara'ah of normal Bi'ah and full Bi'ah Lo k'Darkah.</p>
<p class="bas indent1"><span class="nm">(h)</span><span class="cl">Objection:</span> We could have said this about relations with a Nidah. Why did the Mishnah discuss a Shomeres Yom k'Neged Yom?</p>
<p class="bas indent1"><span class="nm">(i)</span><span class="cl">Defense of Answer #1:</span> Really, Beis Din permitted Ha'ara'ah with a Shomeres Yom;</p>
<p class="bas indent2"><span class="nm">1.</span>This is not explicit in the Torah. "Es Mekorah He'erah" forbids Ha'ara'ah with a Nidah, but not with a Shomeres Yom!</p>
<p class="bas indent1"><span class="nm">(j)</span><span class="cl">Answer #4:</span> Beis Din said that a woman becomes a Zavah only if she sees blood during the days, and not if she sees at night. (The Tzedukim say that she is Tehorah, for it says "Kol <i>Yemei</i> Zovah.")</p>
<p class="bas indent1"><span class="nm">(k)</span><span class="cl">Question #2 (against Rav Yehudah - Mishnah):</span> If Beis Din forbade Melachah on Shabbos, but exempted one who transfers from one Reshus to another, they are liable.</p>
<p class="bas indent2"><span class="nm">1.</span>Transferring Reshus is explicit (in Nevi'im) - "v'Lo Sotzi'u Masa mi'Bateichem"!</p>
<p class="bas indent1"><span class="nm">(l)</span><span class="cl">Answer #1:</span> The verse forbids taking from Reshus ha'Yachid to Reshus ha'Rabim. Beis Din permitted the other direction.</p>
<p class="bas indent1"><span class="nm">(m)</span><span class="cl">Answer #2:</span> The verse forbids carrying from Reshus to Reshus. Beis Din permitted passing or throwing something from Reshus to Reshus.</p>
<p class="bas indent1"><span class="nm">(n)</span><span class="cl">Question #3 (Mishnah):</span> If they forbade idolatry, but exempted one who bows...</p>
<p class="bas indent2"><span class="nm">1.</span>This is explicit - "Lo Sishtachaveh l'El Acher"!</p>
<p class="bas indent1"><span class="nm">(o)</span><span class="cl">Answer #1:</span> They forbade bowing to idolatry normally served by bowing. They permitted bowing to other idolatry.</p>
<p class="bas indent1"><span class="nm">(p)</span><span class="cl">Answer #2:</span> They forbade spreading the hands and feet while bowing. They permitted bowing without doing this.</p>

<p class="bas indent1"><span class="nm">(a)</span><span class="cl">Question (Rav Yosef):</span> If they permitted plowing on Shabbos, what is the law?</p>
<p class="bas indent2"><span class="nm">1.</span>Since they acknowledge the other Isurim of Shabbos, this is like uprooting part and keeping part;</p>
<p class="bas indent2"><span class="nm">2.</span>Or, since they totally permit plowing, is this like uprooting the entire Mitzvah?</p>
<p class="bas indent1"><span class="nm">(b)</span><span class="cl">Answer #1 (Mishnah):</span> (If they ruled that) the Torah forbids a Nidah, but exempts one who has relations with a Shomeres Yom k'Neged Yom, Beis Din is liable.</p>
<p class="bas indent2"><span class="nm">1.</span>They are liable, even though they uprooted the entire law of Shomeres Yom k'Neged Yom!</p>
<p class="bas indent1"><span class="nm">(c)</span><span class="cl">Rejection (Rav Yosef):</span> We can answer like we did above. (The case is, they permitted one who saw blood at night, or exempted Ha'ara'ah with a Shomeres Yom k'Neged Yom.)</p>
<p class="bas indent1"><span class="nm">(d)</span><span class="cl">Answer #2 (Mishnah):</span> (If they ruled that) the Torah forbids Melachos on Shabbos, but exempts one who transfers from Reshus ha'Yachid to Reshus ha'Rabim (Beis Din is liable).</p>
<p class="bas indent2"><span class="nm">1.</span>They are liable, even though this uproots the entire law of Hotza'ah (transferring Reshus)!</p>
<p class="bas indent1"><span class="nm">(e)</span><span class="cl">Rejection (Rav Yosef):</span> We can answer like we did above. (They forbade transferring from a Reshus ha'Yachid to a Reshus ha'Rabim, but permitted the other direction, or throwing or passing.)</p>
<p class="bas indent1"><span class="nm">(f)</span><span class="cl">Answer #3 (Mishnah):</span> ... The Torah forbids idolatry, but one who bows is exempt.</p>
<p class="bas indent2"><span class="nm">1.</span>Beis Din is liable, even though this uproots the entire Isur of bowing!</p>
<p class="bas indent1"><span class="nm">(g)</span><span class="cl">Rejection (Rav Yosef):</span> We can answer like we did above. (Beis Din forbade spreading the hands and feet while bowing, and permitted bowing without doing this.)</p>
<p class="bas indent1"><span class="nm">(h)</span><span class="cl">Question (R. Zeira):</span> If they ruled that Shabbos does not apply during Shemitah, what is the law?</p>
<p class="bas indent2"><span class="nm">1.</span><span class="cl">Question:</span> Why would they make such a mistake?</p>
<p class="bas indent2"><span class="nm">2.</span><span class="cl">Answer:</span> They expounded "in plowing and reaping you will rest" - Shabbos applies only in years when you may plow and reap.</p>
<p class="bas indent2"><span class="nm">3.</span><span class="cl">(Explanation of question):</span> Do we say that since they acknowledge that Shabbos applies during other years, this is like uprooting part and keeping part;</p>
<p class="bas indent2"><span class="nm">4.</span>Or, since they totally permit Shabbos during Shemitah, this is like uprooting the entire Mitzvah?</p>
<p class="bas indent1"><span class="nm">(i)</span><span class="cl">Answer (Ravina - Beraisa):</span> If a prophet prophesizes to uproot a Mitzvah (he is a false prophet), he is killed;</p>
<p class="bas indent2"><span class="nm">1.</span>R. Shimon says, if he uproots part of a Mitzvah, he is exempt;</p>
<p class="bas indent2"><span class="nm">2.</span>Regarding idolatry, even if he says to serve it today and abolish it tomorrow, he is killed.</p>
<p class="bas indent2"><span class="nm">3.</span><span class="cl">Inference:</span> If they permitted (an Isur only at certain times, e.g.) Shabbos in Shemitah, this is like uprooting part. (R. Shimon expounds that regarding idolatry, he is liable for this.)</p>
<p class="bas subject"><span class="nm">5)</span>AN INVALID <i>HORA'AH</i></p>
<p class="bas indent1"><span class="nm">(a)</span><span class="cl">(Mishnah):</span> In the following cases, Beis Din is exempt:</p>
<p class="bas indent2"><span class="nm">1.</span>They ruled, and one of them said 'you are wrong';</p>
<p class="bas indent2"><span class="nm">2.</span>The greatest Chacham of the Beis Din was not there;</p>
<p class="bas indent2"><span class="nm">3.</span>One of them was a convert, Mamzer, Nasin, or too old to have children.</p>
<p class="bas indent3"><span class="nm">i.</span>We learn from a Gezerah Shavah "Edah-Edah" from capital cases. Just like there, all the judges must be qualified to give Hora'ah, also here.</p>
<p class="bas indent1"><span class="nm">(b)</span><span class="cl">(Gemara) Question:</span> What is the source that if the greatest Chacham was not there, they are exempt?</p>
<p class="bas indent2"><span class="nm">1.</span><span class="cl">Answer (Rav Sheshes) Question:</span> Why is Beis Din exempt if they permit something that even Tzedukim know is forbidden?</p>
<p class="bas indent2"><span class="nm">2.</span><span class="cl">Answer:</span> They are exempt because people should not have followed Beis Din. They should have known that it was a mistake;</p>
<p class="bas indent3"><span class="nm">i.</span>Likewise, if the greatest Chacham was not there, people should not have followed Beis Din. They should have been concerned lest it is a mistake.</p>

<p class="bas indent1"><span class="nm">(e)</span><span class="cl">Answer #1 (Rav Chisda):</span> "(The Sanhedrin that Moshe picked) will stand there with you" - they must be like you (Moshe, i.e. qualified).</p>
<p class="bas indent1"><span class="nm">(f)</span><span class="cl">Objection:</span> Perhaps this teaches that they must stand with Moshe and not enter the Kodshei ha'Kodoshim! (Alternatively, they must be Tzadikim like Moshe, upon whom the Divine Presence can rest!)</p>

<p class="bas indent1"><span class="nm">(a)</span><span class="cl">(Mishnah):</span> If Beis Din ruled b'Shogeg (mistakenly), and the people sinned b'Shogeg, Beis Din brings a Par;</p>
<p class="bas indent1"><span class="nm">(b)</span>If Beis Din b'Mezid ruled the wrong way, and the people sinned b'Shogeg, everyone who sinned brings a Kisvah or Se'irah;</p>

<p class="bas indent1"><span class="nm">(d)</span><span class="cl">(Gemara) Inference:</span> They are exempt (in the Seifa) only when Beis Din erred, and the people sinned b'Mezid;</p>
<p class="bas indent2"><span class="nm">1.</span>Had they sinned b'Shogeg like Mezid (i.e. they thought they were doing something permitted, and they actually did what Beis Din mistakenly permitted. This is like Mezid, for they did not rely on the Hora'ah), they are liable! (Rashi - the people bring Chata'os; Tosfos Rosh - a Par is brought, and the people are exempt.)</p>
<p class="bas indent2"><span class="nm">2.</span><span class="cl">Question:</span> What is the case?</p>
<p class="bas indent2"><span class="nm">3.</span><span class="cl">Answer:</span> Beis Din permitted Chelev, and people accidentally ate Chelev, i.e. they confused it with permitted fats.</p>
