<div class="subject"><span class="nm">1)</span><p>SPECIAL SEASONAL TORAH READINGS (cont.)</p></div>

<div class="indent1"><span class="nm">(b)</span><p>On Monday, Thursday and Shabbos afternoon we read from the (coming) weekly Parshah;</p></div>
<div class="indent1"><span class="nm">(c)</span><p>This does not count towards reading the Parshah. We read the entire Parshah the coming Shabbos.</p></div>
<div class="indent1"><span class="nm">(d)</span><p>"Va'Ydaber Moshe Es Mo'adei Hash-m El Benei Yisrael" - they should read about each Mo'ed in its time.</p></div>
<div class="indent1"><span class="nm">(e)</span><p><span class="cl">(Gemara - Beraisa):</span> The Torah readings and Haftoros for the Mo'adim are as follows:</p></div>
<div class="indent2"><span class="nm">1.</span><p>On the first day of Pesach we read Parshas Mo'adim, and (the Haftorah is) the Korban Pesach brought in Gilgal;</p></div>
<div class="indent2"><span class="nm">2.</span><p>The Haftorah for the second day (Yom Tov of Chutz la'Aretz) is the Korban Pesach in the days of Yoshiyahu.</p></div>
<div class="indent2"><span class="nm">3.</span><p>On the other days we read from various Parshiyos relating to Pesach.</p></div>
<div class="indent3"><span class="nm">i.</span><p><span class="cl">(Rav Papa):</span> The acronym for them is <b>MAFU</b> (Mishchu, Im Kesef, Pesal Lecha, va'Yedaber).</p></div>

<div class="indent2"><span class="nm">7.</span><p>Others say, we read "In the third month", and the Merkavah (in Yechezkeil);</p></div>

<div class="indent2"><span class="nm">10.</span><p>On Yom Kipur we read "Acharei Mos" and "Ki Ko Omar Ram v'Nisa". At Minchah we read the Parshas Arayos, and the Haftorah is Sefer Yonah.</p></div>
<div class="indent3"><span class="nm">i.</span><p><span class="cl">(R. Yochanan):</span> Wherever Hash-m's greatness is mentioned, His humility is mentioned right after this. We find this in Torah, Nevi'im, and Kesuvim.</p></div>
<div class="indent3"><span class="nm">ii.</span><p>In Torah it says "Hash-m... Elokei ha'Elokim... Ose Mishpat Yasom v'Almanah". In Nevi'im it says "Cho Omar Ram v'Nisa... v'Es Daka u'Shfal Ru'ach". In Kesuvim it says "Solu la'Rochev ba'Aravos ... Avi Yesomim v'Dayan Almanos".</p></div>
<div class="indent1"><span class="nm">(f)</span><p>On the first day of Sukos we read Parshas Mo'adim in Vayikra, and "Hinei Yom Ba la'Shem" for the Haftorah;</p></div>

<div class="indent1"><span class="nm">(l)</span><p>On Chanukah we read (Chanukas ha'Mishkan of) the Nesi'im, and (on Shabbos) the Neros in Zecharyah for the Haftorah;</p></div>
<div class="indent2"><span class="nm">1.</span><p>If there is a second Shabbos, its Haftorah is the Neros of Shlomo.</p></div>
<div class="indent1"><span class="nm">(m)</span><p>On Purim we read "Va'Yavo Amalek".</p></div>

<div class="bbbline">31b----------------------------------------31b</p></div>
<div class="indent1"><span class="nm">(o)</span><p><span class="cl">(Rav Huna):</span> When Rosh Chodesh Av falls on Shabbos, the Haftorah is "Chodsheichem u'Mo'adeichem San'ah Nafshi...."</p></div>
<div class="indent2"><span class="nm">1.</span><p>"Hayu Alai l'Torach" - they force Hash-m to devise an appropriate punishment.</p></div>
<div class="indent1"><span class="nm">(p)</span><p><span class="cl">(Rav):</span> On Tish'ah b'Av, the Haftorah is "Eichah Haysah l'Zonah".</p></div>
<div class="indent1"><span class="nm">(q)</span><p><span class="cl">(Beraisa - Others):</span> The Torah reading is "V'Im Lo Tishme'u Li";</p></div>
<div class="indent1"><span class="nm">(r)</span><p>R. Nosan bar Yosef says, it is "Ad Anah Yena'atzuni ha'Am ha'Zeh";</p></div>
<div class="indent1"><span class="nm">(s)</span><p>Some say it is "Ad Anah la'Edah ha'Ra'ah ha'Zos".</p></div>
<div class="indent1"><span class="nm">(t)</span><p><span class="cl">(Abaye):</span> The custom is to read "Ki Solid Banim", and "Asof Asifem" for the Haftorah.</p></div>
<div class="subject"><span class="nm">2)</span><p>MA'AMADOS</p></div>
<div class="indent1"><span class="nm">(a)</span><p><span class="cl">(Mishnah):</span> On Ma'amados we read Ma'ase Bereishis.</p></div>
<div class="indent1"><span class="nm">(b)</span><p><span class="cl">Question:</span> What is the source of this?</p></div>
<div class="indent1"><span class="nm">(c)</span><p><span class="cl">Answer (R. Ami):</span> Heaven and earth would not endure without (the Torah of Yisrael, who would not endure without) the merit of Ma'amados. It says "Im Lo Brisi Yomam va'Laylah Chukos Shamayim va'Aretz Lo Samti", and it says "Ba'Meh Eda";</p></div>
<div class="indent2"><span class="nm">1.</span><p><span class="cl">Avraham asked Hash-m:</span> If Benei Yisrael will sin, will they be destroyed like Dor ha'Mabul or scattered like Dor ha'Flagah?</p></div>
<div class="indent2"><span class="nm">2.</span><p><span class="cl">Hash-m:</span> No.</p></div>
<div class="indent2"><span class="nm">3.</span><p><span class="cl">Avraham:</span> "Ba'Meh Eda (how can I teach them to get Kaparah for their sins)?"</p></div>
<div class="indent2"><span class="nm">4.</span><p><span class="cl">Hash-m:</span> "Kache Li Eglah... (Korbanos can atone for them)."</p></div>
<div class="indent2"><span class="nm">5.</span><p><span class="cl">Avraham:</span> What will happen when there is no Beis ha'Mikdash?</p></div>
<div class="indent2"><span class="nm">6.</span><p><span class="cl">Hash-m:</span> When they read the Parshiyos of Korbanos, I consider it as if they offered them, and I will pardon all their sins.</p></div>
<div class="subject"><span class="nm">3)</span><p>BERACHOS AND KLALOS</p></div>
<div class="indent1"><span class="nm">(a)</span><p><span class="cl">(Mishnah):</span> On Ta'aneisim we read Berachos and Klalos. We do not end an Aliyah in the middle of the Klalos.</p></div>
<div class="indent1"><span class="nm">(b)</span><p><span class="cl">Question:</span> What is the reason?</p></div>
<div class="indent1"><span class="nm">(c)</span><p><span class="cl">Answer #1 (R. Chiya bar Gamda):</span> "My son, do not despise the rebuke of Hash-m."</p></div>
<div class="indent1"><span class="nm">(d)</span><p><span class="cl">Answer #2 (Reish Lakish):</span> We do not bless on punishments. (Even though in the days of the Mishnah only the first and last Olim blessed, in the Yerushalmi Reish Lakish says that there are certain Parshiyos over which we bless before and after. Berachos and Klalos are among them - Tosfos R. Akiva Eiger.)</p></div>
<div class="indent1"><span class="nm">(e)</span><p><span class="cl">(Beraisa):</span> The one who reads the Klalos starts a verse before them, and reads a verse after them. (It seems that this is like the Tana (22a) who permits reading one verse from a Parshah.)</p></div>
<div class="indent1"><span class="nm">(f)</span><p><span class="cl">(Abaye):</span> This applies to the Klalos in Vayikra, but not to those in Devarim.</p></div>
<div class="indent1"><span class="nm">(g)</span><p><span class="cl">Question:</span> What is the reason?</p></div>
<div class="indent1"><span class="nm">(h)</span><p><span class="cl">Answer:</span> The Klalos in Vayikra were said in the plural ("Im Lo Tishme'u... "), and Hash-m said them through Moshe. Those in Devarim were said in the singular, and Moshe said them (with Ru'ach ha'Kodesh).</p></div>
<div class="indent1"><span class="nm">(i)</span><p>Levi bar Buti was hurriedly muttering the Klalos in Devarim (he was distressed to say them). Rav Huna told him that one may stop in the middle of the Klalos in Devarim.</p></div>
<div class="indent1"><span class="nm">(j)</span><p><span class="cl">(Beraisa -R. Shimon ben Elazar):</span> Ezra enacted that we should read the Klalos in Vayikra before Shavu'os, and those in Devarim before Rosh Hashanah.</p></div>
<div class="indent1"><span class="nm">(k)</span><p><span class="cl">(Abaye):</span> This is so we should finish the year and its Klalos.</p></div>
<div class="indent1"><span class="nm">(l)</span><p><span class="cl">Question:</span> This does not explain those in Vayikra!</p></div>
<div class="indent1"><span class="nm">(m)</span><p><span class="cl">Answer:</span> It does!</p></div>
<div class="indent2"><span class="nm">1.</span><p><span class="cl">(Mishnah):</span> The world is judged on Shavu'os regarding fruits (it is also like a new year).</p></div>
<div class="indent1"><span class="nm">(n)</span><p><span class="cl">(Beraisa - R. Shimon ben Elazar):</span> If elders tell you to destroy, and youths tell you to build, listen to the elders - their destruction is building, and the building of youths is destruction, like we find regarding Rechavam. (Elders told him to be gentle for one day, to solidify his kingship. Youths told him to be harsh to solidify his reign, and this caused him to lose most of the kingdom - Melachim 1:12.)</p></div>
<div class="subject"><span class="nm">4)</span><p>THE READING OF MONDAY, THURSDAY AND SHABBOS AFTERNOON</p></div>
<div class="indent1"><span class="nm">(a)</span><p><span class="cl">(Beraisa - R. Meir):</span> Each time we read the Torah (Shabbos morning, Shabbos afternoon, Monday, and Thursday) we begin reading where we stopped the previous time;</p></div>
<div class="indent1"><span class="nm">(b)</span><p>R. Yehudah says, on Shabbos afternoon, Monday, Thursday and the coming Shabbos morning we begin where we stopped last Shabbos morning.</p></div>
<div class="indent1"><span class="nm">(c)</span><p><span class="cl">(R. Zeira):</span> The Halachah is, on Shabbos afternoon, Monday, Thursday and the coming Shabbos morning we begin where we stopped last Shabbos morning.</p></div>
<div class="indent1"><span class="nm">(d)</span><p><span class="cl">Question:</span> Why didn't he simply say that the Halachah follows R. Yehudah?</p></div>
<div class="indent1"><span class="nm">(e)</span><p><span class="cl">Answer:</span> He had to say the law explicitly, because some switch the opinions of R. Meir and R. Yehudah (from our text of the Beraisa).</p></div>
