<div class="subject"><span class="nm">1)</span><p>A <i>NOCHRI</i> ON ONE SIDE OF A <i>MAVOY</i> (cont.)</p></div>
<div class="indent1"><span class="nm">(a)</span><p><span class="cl">Question:</span> Rav already taught this. Why would he have to teach both of these?</p></div>
<div class="indent1"><span class="nm">(b)</span><p><span class="cl">Answer:</span> Had he taught only that teaching (a Mavoy needs houses...), one might have thought that Dirah of a Nochri is Dirah. Therefore he taught this teaching (a Nochri in a Mavoy) to teach that it is not Dirah;</p></div>
<div class="indent2"><span class="nm">1.</span><p>Had he taught only this teaching, we would not know how many houses are required. The other teaching teaches that two are required [to open to each Chatzer].</p></div>
<div class="indent2"><span class="nm">2.</span><p>Now that Rav taught that [that one may not be Me'arev through windows] even regarding a Chatzer [with a Nochri on one side], we know that his reason is because one may not live alone with a Nochri [lest he learn from his ways. Therefore, one may not be Me'arev through windows, in order that no Yisrael will be with Reuven in the Mavoy with the Nochri, and Reuven will fear to be there].</p></div>
<div class="indent1"><span class="nm">(c)</span><p><span class="cl">Rav Yosef:</span> R. Tavla was saying 'Nochri, Nochri.' I did not understand this until now. (He alluded to the Isur to be Me'arev when there is a Nochri on one side of a Mavoy or a Chatzer.)</p></div>
<div class="subject"><span class="nm">2)</span><p>DOES DRISAS HA'REGEL FORBID?</p></div>
<div class="indent1"><span class="nm">(a)</span><p><span class="cl">(Mishnah):</span> If there is an inner Chatzer and an outer Chatzer:</p></div>
<div class="indent2"><span class="nm">1.</span><p>If only the inner Chatzer was Me'arev, it is permitted [to transfer between its houses and the inner Chatzer], and the outer Chatzer is forbidden;</p></div>
<div class="indent2"><span class="nm">2.</span><p>If only the outer Chatzer was Me'arev, both are forbidden.</p></div>
<div class="indent1"><span class="nm">(b)</span><p>If each was Me'arev by itself, each is permitted by itself [but one may not transfer from one Chatzer to the other];</p></div>
<div class="indent1"><span class="nm">(c)</span><p>R. Akiva forbids the outer Chatzer due to Drisas ha'Regel of the inner Chatzer;</p></div>
<div class="indent1"><span class="nm">(d)</span><p>Chachamim say, Drisas ha'Regel does not forbid it.</p></div>
<div class="indent1"><span class="nm">(e)</span><p>If an outer person forgot to be Me'arev, the inner Chatzer is permitted, and the outer Chatzer is forbidden;</p></div>
<div class="indent1"><span class="nm">(f)</span><p>If an inner person forgot, both Chatzeros are forbidden;</p></div>
<div class="indent1"><span class="nm">(g)</span><p>If both Eruvin were put in one place (this will be explained), and someone forgot to be Me'arev, whether he is in the inner or outer Chatzer, both Chatzeros are forbidden;</p></div>
<div class="indent1"><span class="nm">(h)</span><p>If each Chatzer had only one resident, they need not be Me'arev.</p></div>
<div class="indent1"><span class="nm">(i)</span><p><span class="cl">Version #1 (Gemara - Rav Dimi citing R. Yanai):</span> The Reisha is R. Akiva's opinion, who says that even people who are permitted in their place (Chatzer) forbid elsewhere. Chachamim say, just like people permitted in their place do not forbid [elsewhere], also people forbidden in their place do not forbid.</p></div>
<div class="indent1"><span class="nm">(j)</span><p><span class="cl">Question #1 (Mishnah):</span> If only the outer Chatzer was Me'arev, both are forbidden.</p></div>
<div class="indent2"><span class="nm">1.</span><p><span class="cl">Question:</span> Who taught this clause?</p></div>
<div class="indent3"><span class="nm">i.</span><p>It cannot be R. Akiva. He says [in the Seifa] that even people permitted in their place forbid. He need not teach that people forbidden in their place forbid!</p></div>
<div class="indent2"><span class="nm">2.</span><p><span class="cl">Answer #1:</span> It is Chachamim.</p></div>
<div class="indent1"><span class="nm">(k)</span><p><span class="cl">Answer (and Answer #2 to Question (1)):</span> Really, it is R. Akiva. Indeed, he teaches a small Chidush and then a larger Chidush [which encompasses the smaller Chidush].</p></div>
<div class="indent1"><span class="nm">(l)</span><p><span class="cl">Question #2 (Mishnah):</span> If each was Me'arev by itself, each is permitted by itself.</p></div>
<div class="indent2"><span class="nm">1.</span><p><span class="cl">Inference:</span> They are permitted only because both of them were Me'arev. However, had one not been Me'arev, both would be forbidden.</p></div>
<div class="indent2"><span class="nm">2.</span><p>The Tana holds that permitted people (i.e. when each was Me'arev by itself) do not forbid, yet forbidden people (who were not Me'arev) forbid!</p></div>
<div class="indent2"><span class="nm">3.</span><p>R. Akiva did not teach this. He holds that permitted people forbid. It must be Chachamim!</p></div>
<div class="indent3"><span class="nm">i.</span><p>Also, since the Seifa is R. Akiva, the Reisha is not R. Akiva!</p></div>
<div class="indent1"><span class="nm">(m)</span><p><span class="cl">Answer:</span> Really, also the Reisha is R. Akiva. The Mishnah is abbreviated. It means as follows:</p></div>
<div class="indent2"><span class="nm">1.</span><p>If each was Me'arev by itself, each is permitted by itself;</p></div>
<div class="indent2"><span class="nm">2.</span><p>This is when there is a small door between the Chatzeros. If not, the outer Chatzer is forbidden due to Drisas ha'Regel of the inner.</p></div>
<div class="indent2"><span class="nm">3.</span><p>This is the opinion of R. Akiva, who forbids the outer due to Drisas ha'Regel.</p></div>
<div class="indent2"><span class="nm">4.</span><p>Chachamim say, Drisas ha'Regel does not forbid.</p></div>
<div class="indent1"><span class="nm">(n)</span><p><span class="cl">Question #3 (Rav Bivi bar Abaye - Seifa):</span> If each Chatzer had only one resident, they need not be Me'arev.</p></div>
<div class="indent2"><span class="nm">1.</span><p><span class="cl">Inference:</span> If [either] Chatzer had more than one person, they would need to be Me'arev.</p></div>
<div class="indent2"><span class="nm">2.</span><p>This shows that someone permitted (when each Chatzer had only one resident) does not forbid, but someone forbidden (when a Chatzer has more than one resident) forbids!</p></div>
<div class="indent1"><span class="nm">(o)</span><p><span class="cl">Question #4 (Ravina - Mishnah):</span> If an outer person forgot to be Me'arev, the inner Chatzer is permitted, and the outer is forbidden. If an inner person forgot, both are forbidden.</p></div>
<div class="indent2"><span class="nm">1.</span><p><span class="cl">Inference:</span> If no one forgot, both are permitted.</p></div>
<div class="indent2"><span class="nm">2.</span><p>This shows that someone permitted (e.g. when no one forgot) does not forbid, but someone forbidden (e.g. when an inner person forgot) forbids!</p></div>
<div class="indent1"><span class="nm">(p)</span><p><span class="cl">Version #2 (Ravin citing R. Yanai):</span> There is a three-way argument among the Tana'im. The first Tana holds that forbidden people forbid, but permitted people do not. R. Akiva holds that even permitted people forbid. The latter Chachamim hold that just like permitted people do not forbid, also forbidden people do not. (Ritva - the entire Reisha is R. Akiva, like we answered before. The Chachamim who say 'Drisas ha'Regel does not forbid' hold that it never forbids. The Tana of the Seifa (when someone forgot) holds that forbidden people forbid, but people permitted do not. According to this, Ravin answers Questions 3 and 4 for Rav Dimi. However, this is unlike our text, which says 'the <i>first</i> Tana holds that forbidden people forbid, but permitted people do not' - <b>PF</b>.)</p></div>
<div class="subject"><span class="nm">3)</span><p>IF SOMEONE FORGOT TO BE ME'AREV</p></div>
<div class="indent1"><span class="nm">(a)</span><p><span class="cl">(Mishnah):</span> If the Eruv [for both Chatzeros] was put in one place, and anyone forgot to be Me'arev [both Chatzeros are forbidden].</p></div>
<div class="indent1"><span class="nm">(b)</span><p><span class="cl">Question:</span> What is the meaning of 'in one place'?</p></div>
<div class="indent1"><span class="nm">(c)</span><p><span class="cl">Answer (Rav Yehudah):</span> It means the outer Chatzer.</p></div>
<div class="indent1"><span class="nm">(d)</span><p><span class="cl">Question:</span> Why is it called 'in one place'?</p></div>
<div class="indent1"><span class="nm">(e)</span><p><span class="cl">Answer:</span> It is the one place that both of them use.</p></div>

<div class="indent1"><span class="nm">(f)</span><p><span class="cl">Support (Beraisa - R. Akiva):</span> If the Eruv was put in the outer Chatzer, and anyone forgot to be Me'arev, both Chatzeros are forbidden;</p></div>
<div class="indent1"><span class="nm">(g)</span><p>If the Eruv was put in the inner Chatzer, whether an inner or outer person forgot to be Me'arev, both are forbidden;</p></div>
<div class="indent1"><span class="nm">(h)</span><p>Chachamim say, if an outer person forgot, the inner Chatzer is permitted, and the outer is forbidden.</p></div>
<div class="indent1"><span class="nm">(i)</span><p><span class="cl">Question (Rabah bar Rav Chanan):</span> Presumably, Chachamim permitted the inner Chatzer when an outer person forgot, because they can close the door and use their Chatzer by themselves. R. Akiva should agree with this!</p></div>
<div class="indent1"><span class="nm">(j)</span><p><span class="cl">Answer (Abaye):</span> They have Drisas ha'Regel in the Chatzer because their Eruv is there.</p></div>
<div class="indent1"><span class="nm">(k)</span><p><span class="cl">Question:</span> Chachamim should agree that they have Drisas ha'Regel due to their Eruv!</p></div>
<div class="indent1"><span class="nm">(l)</span><p><span class="cl">Answer:</span> The inner people say 'we were Me'arev with you only for our benefit, not for our detriment!'</p></div>
<div class="indent1"><span class="nm">(m)</span><p><span class="cl">Question:</span> R. Akiva should agree with this!</p></div>
<div class="indent1"><span class="nm">(n)</span><p><span class="cl">Answer:</span> R. Akiva holds that the outer Chatzer can be Mevatel Reshus to the inner (this permits the inner, so it (the Eruv) is not detrimental to them. He forbids only before Bitul);</p></div>
<div class="indent2"><span class="nm">1.</span><p>Chachamim hold that Bitul does not work from one Chatzer to another. (If not, they would agree and forbid before Bitul.)</p></div>
<div class="indent1"><span class="nm">(o)</span><p><span class="cl">Suggestion:</span> Shmuel and R. Yochanan argue like Chachamim and R. Akiva:</p></div>
<div class="indent2"><span class="nm">1.</span><p>Shmuel (68a) holds that Bitul does not work from one Chatzer to another, like Chachamim. R. Yochanan holds that it works, like R. Akiva!</p></div>
<div class="indent1"><span class="nm">(p)</span><p><span class="cl">Rejection #1:</span> Even R. Akiva could hold like Shmuel. R. Akiva only allows Bitul from one Chatzer to another when they forbid each other. He could agree that when neither forbids the other (each has its own opening to Reshus ha'Rabim) that Bitul does not work;</p></div>
<div class="indent1"><span class="nm">(q)</span><p><span class="cl">Rejection #2:</span> Even Chachamim could hold like R. Yochanan (Bitul works from one Chatzer to another. Here [the Eruv does not join the Chatzeros for this would be detrimental,] the inner Chatzer would be forbidden until Bitul. (Therefore the Eruv permits just the inner Chatzer, and Bitul is not needed.)</p></div>
<div class="subject"><span class="nm">4)</span><p>RABIM FORBID AN OUTER CHATZER</p></div>
<div class="indent1"><span class="nm">(a)</span><p><span class="cl">(Mishnah):</span> If each Chatzer had only one resident, they need not be Me'arev.</p></div>
<div class="indent1"><span class="nm">(b)</span><p><span class="cl">(Rav Yosef - Rebbi - Beraisa):</span> If there were three [residents among the two Chatzeros, even if two are in the outer Chatzer], it (the outer Chatzer) is forbidden (Rashi. R. Chananel - if there were three [Chatzeros, one inside the other], all are forbidden.)</p></div>
<div class="indent1"><span class="nm">(c)</span><p><span class="cl">Rav Bivi:</span> Do not heed Rav Yosef [who says that this is a Beraisa]. I taught it to him in the name of Rav Ada bar Ahavah;</p></div>
<div class="indent2"><span class="nm">1.</span><p>They are forbidden because <i>Rabim</i> (three) use the outer Chatzer (R. Chananel. Rashi - when Rabim (<i>two</i>) are in the outer Chatzer, we decree to forbid due to when there are Rabim in the inner Chatzer. (Since they forbid themselves without an Eruv, their Drisas ha'Regel forbids the outer Chatzer.))</p></div>
<div class="indent1"><span class="nm">(d)</span><p><span class="cl">Rav Yosef:</span> Indeed, this is what I heard. I confused '[since they are a] <i>Rabim'</i> with 'Rabi', and therefore attributed it to Rebbi. (The proper pronunciation of 'Rebbi' is actually 'Rabi'.)</p></div>
<div class="indent1"><span class="nm">(e)</span><p><span class="cl">(Shmuel):</span> They are permitted unless there are two in the inner Chatzer.</p></div>
<div class="indent1"><span class="nm">(f)</span><p><span class="cl">(R. Elazar):</span> A Nochri is like a Rabim. (If he is in the inner Chatzer, and there are two (Rashi; R. Chananel, according to Milchamos Hash-m - even one) Yisrael(im) in the outer, the Nochri forbids. This is like Shmuel.)</p></div>
<div class="indent1"><span class="nm">(g)</span><p><span class="cl">Question:</span> A lone Yisrael [inside] does not forbid [for there is no need to decree]:</p></div>
<div class="indent2"><span class="nm">1.</span><p>People who know that he is alone know that he himself is permitted. (They will not conclude that Drisas ha'Regel of someone forbidden does not forbid.) People who think that there are more than one inside will assume that they were Me'arev;</p></div>
<div class="indent2"><span class="nm">2.</span><p>Likewise, a lone Nochri should not forbid. People who know that he is alone understand why he does not forbid. People who think that Yisraelim live with him will assume that they rented his Reshus!</p></div>
<div class="indent1"><span class="nm">(h)</span><p><span class="cl">Answer:</span> If a Nochri rented his Reshus he would publicize this. (If one thinks that Yisraelim live with him, since he did not hear about a rental, he will mistakenly conclude that Drisas ha'Regel never forbids).</p></div>
<div class="indent1"><span class="nm">(i)</span><p><span class="cl">(Rav Yehudah):</span> If there are 10 houses, one inside the other, it suffices for the innermost one to be Me'arev with the Chatzer. (Since the innermost resident walks through the others, they are like Batei Sha'ar which need not be Me'arev - 85b);</p></div>
<div class="indent1"><span class="nm">(j)</span><p><span class="cl">(R. Yochanan):</span> Even the outer[most] house [must be Me'arev].</p></div>
<div class="indent1"><span class="nm">(k)</span><p><span class="cl">Objection:</span> All the other houses pass through it. Surely it is like a Beis Sha'ar!</p></div>
<div class="indent1"><span class="nm">(l)</span><p><span class="cl">Correction:</span> He refers to the house outside the innermost one [must be Me'arev].</p></div>
<div class="indent1"><span class="nm">(m)</span><p><span class="cl">Question:</span> What do they argue about?</p></div>
<div class="indent1"><span class="nm">(n)</span><p><span class="cl">Answer:</span> Rav Yehudah holds that a Beis Sha'ar of an individual (only the innermost house has Drisas ha'Regel through the second) is considered a Beis Sha'ar. R. Yochanan holds that it is not.</p></div>
