<p class="bas subject"><span class="nm">1)</span>WHAT PROOF IS NEEDED TO COLLECT A <i>KESUVAH</i>?</p>
<p class="bas indent1"><span class="nm">(a)</span><span class="cl">(Mishnah):</span> If a woman shows a Get without a Kesuvah, she collects a Kesuvah.</p>
<p class="bas indent1"><span class="nm">(b)</span>In the following cases, one need not pay:</p>
<p class="bas indent2"><span class="nm">1.</span>She shows a Kesuvah without a Get and says that she lost her Get, and he says that (Beis Din tore her Get when he paid her Kesuvah, and) he lost his receipt;</p>
<p class="bas indent2"><span class="nm">2.</span>A creditor shows a loan document (from before Shemitah) without a Pruzbul (a document showing that the loan was given over to Beis Din before Shemitah, which permits collecting it after Shemitah).</p>
<p class="bas indent1"><span class="nm">(c)</span>R. Shimon ben Gamliel says, after there were decrees not to keep Mitzvos (we destroy a Get after it is given and a Pruzbul after it is written), a woman collects her Kesuvah without a Get, and a creditor collects his debt without a Pruzbul.</p>
<p class="bas indent1"><span class="nm">(d)</span><span class="cl">(Gemara) Question:</span> We learn from our Mishnah that (if a creditor lost his document, we force the borrower to pay and) we write a receipt (even though the borrower might be forced to pay again if he loses the receipt).</p>
<p class="bas indent2"><span class="nm">1.</span>If we do not write a receipt, we should be concerned lest she collect with her Get, and show her Kesuvah (after her ex-husband dies, claim that she was widowed) and collect again! (Tosfos - this is difficult for the Amora'im who say that we do not write receipts. Rashi - this is difficult, for the Halachah is we do not write receipts!)</p>
<p class="bas indent1"><span class="nm">(e)</span><span class="cl">Answer (Rav):</span> (Normally, we do not write receipts.) The Mishnah discusses a place where Kesuvos are not written (so there is no concern).</p>
<p class="bas indent1"><span class="nm">(f)</span><span class="cl">(Shmuel):</span> The Mishnah discusses even a place where Kesuvos are written.</p>
<p class="bas indent1"><span class="nm">(g)</span><span class="cl">Question:</span> Does Shmuel hold that we write a receipt?!</p>
<p class="bas indent1"><span class="nm">(h)</span><span class="cl">Answer (Rav Anan):</span> No. Shmuel explained to me that in a place where Kesuvos are not written, if he claims that he wrote a Kesuvah, he must bring proof (or pay). In a place where Kesuvos are written, if she claims that he did not write a Kesuvah, she must bring proof (to collect).</p>
<p class="bas indent1"><span class="nm">(i)</span>Rav retracted from what he had said.</p>
<p class="bas indent2"><span class="nm">1.</span><span class="cl">Retraction (Rav):</span> Whether or not Kesuvos are written or not in the place, if she shows (only) a Get, she receives the basic Kesuvah (100 or 200, but no additions to this). If she shows (only) a Kesuvah, she receives any Tosefes (but not the basic Kesuvah, lest she collect it again by showing her Get).</p>
<p class="bas indent2"><span class="nm">2.</span><span class="cl">Rav:</span> If anyone has any objection to this, say it!</p>
<p class="bas indent1"><span class="nm">(j)</span><span class="cl">Question (Mishnah):</span> If she shows a Kesuvah without a Get and says that she lost her Get, and he says that he lost his receipt, or if a creditor shows a loan document without a Pruzbul, the husband or borrower need not pay.</p>
<p class="bas indent2"><span class="nm">1.</span>Shmuel can establish the Mishnah to be in a place where Kesuvos are not written. He claims that previously she showed her Get, and he was unable to prove that he had written a Kesuvah, and was forced to pay. Therefore, he does not pay now;</p>
<p class="bas indent2"><span class="nm">2.</span>But according to Rav, he should pay the Tosefes!</p>
<p class="bas indent1"><span class="nm">(k)</span><span class="cl">Answer (Rav Yosef):</span> The case is, there are no witnesses who saw the divorce.</p>
<p class="bas indent2"><span class="nm">1.</span>Migo (since) he would be believed to say that he never divorced her, he is believed to say that he divorced her and paid the Kesuvah.</p>

<p class="bas indent1"><span class="nm">(l)</span><span class="cl">Question (Seifa - R. Shimon ben Gamliel):</span> From the time of decrees, a woman collects her Kesuvah without a Get, and a creditor without a Pruzbul.</p>
<p class="bas indent2"><span class="nm">1.</span>We must say that she has witnesses who saw the divorce. If not, how can she collect?</p>
<p class="bas indent1"><span class="nm">(m)</span><span class="cl">Answer:</span> R. Shimon ben Gamliel taught the entire Mishnah. It is abbreviated, and it means as follows:</p>
<p class="bas indent2"><span class="nm">1.</span>They do not collect (without a Get or Pruzbul). This is when she does not have witnesses who saw the divorce. If she has witnesses, she collects the Tosefes;</p>
<p class="bas indent2"><span class="nm">2.</span>She collects the basic Kesuvah (100 or 200) only if she shows a Get;</p>
<p class="bas indent2"><span class="nm">3.</span>From the decrees and onwards, even if she does not show the Get she collects, for R. Shimon says that after the decrees a woman collects her Kesuvah without a Get, and a creditor collects without a Pruzbul.</p>
<p class="bas subject"><span class="nm">2)</span>HOW A WIDOW COLLECTS HER <i>KESUVAH</i></p>
<p class="bas indent1"><span class="nm">(a)</span><span class="cl">Question (Rav Kahana to Rav):</span> You hold that the basic Kesuvah is collected only with a Get. How does a widow from Nisu'in collect?</p>
<p class="bas indent2"><span class="nm">1.</span>You must say that she collects through witnesses that her husband died. We should be concerned lest she was divorced, and she will collect again with her Get!</p>
<p class="bas indent1"><span class="nm">(b)</span><span class="cl">Answer #1:</span> The witnesses know that she was living with her husband just before he died.</p>
<p class="bas indent1"><span class="nm">(c)</span><span class="cl">Question:</span> Perhaps he divorced her right before he died!</p>
<p class="bas indent1"><span class="nm">(d)</span><span class="cl">Answer:</span> If so, he caused that she will be able to collect twice.</p>
<p class="bas indent1"><span class="nm">(e)</span><span class="cl">Question:</span> How can a widow from Eirusin collect? If we rely on witnesses that her husband died, we should be concerned lest she was divorced and will collect again with her Get!</p>
<p class="bas indent1"><span class="nm">(f)</span><span class="cl">Answer (and Answer #2 to Question (a)):</span> When there is no other solution, Rav agrees that we write a receipt.</p>
<p class="bas indent2"><span class="nm">1.</span>If not, when she collects with witnesses of death, we should be concerned lest she collect again with other witnesses in a different Beis Din!</p>
<p class="bas subject"><span class="nm">3)</span>WHAT IS THE SOURCE THAT AN <i>ARUSAH</i> GETS A <i>KESUVAH</i>?</p>
<p class="bas indent1"><span class="nm">(a)</span><span class="cl">Question (Mar Kashisha brei d'Rav Chisda):</span> How do we know that a widow from Eirusin receives a Kesuvah (even if he did not write one)?</p>
<p class="bas indent1"><span class="nm">(b)</span><span class="cl">Answer #1 (Mishnah):</span> If she is widowed or divorced, whether from Eirusin or Nisu'in, she receives everything (her full Kesuvah).</p>
<p class="bas indent1"><span class="nm">(c)</span><span class="cl">Rejection:</span> Perhaps that is when he wrote for her a Kesuvah!</p>
<p class="bas indent2"><span class="nm">1.</span><span class="cl">Question:</span> If he wrote for her a Kesuvah, this is obvious! Why did the Mishnah need to teach it?</p>
<p class="bas indent2"><span class="nm">2.</span><span class="cl">Answer:</span> The Tana teaches unlike R. Eliezer ben Azaryah, who says that he wrote (Tosefes) only on condition that they have Nisu'in.</p>
<p class="bas indent1"><span class="nm">(d)</span><span class="cl">Support (Mishnah):</span> She collects everything.</p>
<p class="bas indent2"><span class="nm">1.</span>This is reasonable if he wrote a Kesuvah. But if he didn't write one, why does it say <i>everything</i>? She is entitled to only 100 or 200!</p>
<p class="bas indent1"><span class="nm">(e)</span><span class="cl">Answer #2 (Rav Ashi - Rav Chiya bar Avin's Beraisa):</span> If an Arusah dies, her husband is not an Onen. He need not (may not, if he is a Kohen) become Tamei for needs of her burial, and he does not inherit her. Similarly, if he dies she is not an Onenes, and she need not become Tamei for him, but she collects her Kesuvah.</p>
<p class="bas indent1"><span class="nm">(f)</span><span class="cl">Rejection:</span> Perhaps this is when he wrote a Kesuvah!</p>
<p class="bas indent2"><span class="nm">1.</span><span class="cl">Question:</span> If so, this is obvious! What does the Beraisa teach?</p>
<p class="bas indent2"><span class="nm">2.</span><span class="cl">Answer:</span> It teaches that when she dies, he does not inherit her (even though he wrote a Kesuvah and was close to Nisu'in).</p>
<p class="bas indent1"><span class="nm">(g)</span><span class="cl">Question (Rav Nachman):</span> According to Rav, who says that she collects the basic Kesuvah with a Get, we should be concerned lest she collect with it again in another Beis Din!</p>
<p class="bas indent2"><span class="nm">1.</span>You cannot say that we tear it up when she collects, for she needs it to prove that she may remarry!</p>
<p class="bas indent1"><span class="nm">(h)</span><span class="cl">Answer (Rav Huna):</span> We tear it, and write on the back that it was not torn because it is invalid, rather, so she should not collect the Kesuvah again.</p>
<p class="bas subject"><span class="nm">4)</span>A WOMAN WHO REMARRIED HER EX-HUSBAND</p>
<p class="bas indent1"><span class="nm">(a)</span><span class="cl">(Mishnah):</span> If a woman has two Gitin and two Kesuvos, she collects two Kesuvos. (The date of the first Get is in between the dates on the Kesuvos.)</p>
<p class="bas indent1"><span class="nm">(b)</span>If she has two Kesuvos and one Get (dated after both of them), or one Kesuvah and two Gitin, or one Kesuvah and one Get and witnesses to her husband's death, she collects only one Kesuvah. This is because one who remarries his ex-wife does so on condition that she will receive only her original Kesuvah.</p>
<p class="bas indent1"><span class="nm">(c)</span><span class="cl">(Gemara) Inference:</span> In the Seifa she can collect either Kesuvah.</p>
<p class="bas indent1"><span class="nm">(d)</span><span class="cl">Suggestion:</span> This refutes Rav Nachman!</p>
<p class="bas indent2"><span class="nm">1.</span><span class="cl">(Rav Nachman):</span> If there are two documents (for the same loan or sale) with different dates, the latter proves that the former is invalid.</p>
<p class="bas indent1"><span class="nm">(e)</span><span class="cl">Rejection:</span> No. Rav Papa said that Rav Nachman agrees that if the second document adds to the first, even a date tree, it was written for the addition. (She can opt to collect the first from land sold from the earlier date, or the second from the latter date).</p>
<p class="bas indent2"><span class="nm">1.</span>Here also, the case is that the second Kesuvah is greater than the first.</p>
