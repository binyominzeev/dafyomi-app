<p class="bas subject"><span class="nm">1)</span>ONE WHO CAN SAVE WITHOUT KILLING</p>
<p class="bas indent1"><span class="nm">(a)</span><span class="cl">Question:</span> What is R. Yonason ben Sha'ul's source?</p>
<p class="bas indent1"><span class="nm">(b)</span><span class="cl">Answer:</span> It says "v'Chi Yinatzu Anashim Yachdav";</p>
<p class="bas indent2"><span class="nm">1.</span><span class="cl">(R. Elazar):</span> The verse discusses a fight to kill - "v'Im Ason Yiheyeh v'Nosata Nefesh Tachas Nafesh" (Beis Din kills only one who intended to kill).</p>
<p class="bas indent2"><span class="nm">2.</span>Still, if no one dies (and one of them hit a woman, killing her fetus) he pays for the loss of the fetus!</p>
<p class="bas indent2"><span class="nm">3.</span>According to R. Yonason ben Sha'ul, we understand why he pays. The case is, someone could have stopped him by maiming a limb.</p>
<p class="bas indent2"><span class="nm">4.</span>However, if a Rodef may be killed even in this case, in what case does he pay?!</p>
<p class="bas indent1"><span class="nm">(c)</span><span class="cl">Question:</span> Perhaps he pays (to the father) for the fetus, because he was Chayav Misah 'to' (i.e. due to) a different person (the man he wanted to kill).</p>
<p class="bas indent1"><span class="nm">(d)</span><span class="cl">Rejection:</span> We do not distinguish. In either case he is exempt;</p>
<p class="bas indent2"><span class="nm">1.</span><span class="cl">(Rava):</span> If Levi was Rodef Yehudah and Levi broke Kelim, he is exempt, whether they belong to Yehudah or to others, for he is liable to be killed.</p>
<p class="bas indent2"><span class="nm">2.</span>If Yehudah broke Levi's Kelim, he is exempt. Since he may kill Levi, and all the more so he may break his Kelim;</p>
<p class="bas indent2"><span class="nm">3.</span>If Yehudah broke someone else's Kelim, he is liable. One may not save himself with another's money (without paying).</p>
<p class="bas indent2"><span class="nm">4.</span>If David was Rodef Levi in order to save Yehudah, and David broke Kelim, whether they belong to Yehudah or to others, he is exempt;</p>
<p class="bas indent3"><span class="nm">i.</span>Letter of the law, he is liable. It is an enactment to exempt him, lest people refrain from trying to save a Nirdaf.</p>
<p class="bas subject"><span class="nm">2)</span>WHEN DO WE KILL TO PREVENT A TRANSGRESSION?</p>
<p class="bas indent1"><span class="nm">(a)</span><span class="cl">(Mishnah):</span> An onlooker may not kill someone chasing an animal to commit bestiality.</p>
<p class="bas indent1"><span class="nm">(b)</span><span class="cl">(Beraisa - R. Shimon):</span> A Kal va'Chomer teaches that we may kill someone about to serve idolatry:</p>
<p class="bas indent2"><span class="nm">1.</span>We may kill someone about to be Pogem (rape) a person, and all the more so if he is about to be 'Pogem' Hash-m (serve idolatry)!</p>
<p class="bas indent2"><span class="nm">2.</span><span class="cl">Question:</span> We do not punish based on a Kal va'Chomer!</p>
<p class="bas indent2"><span class="nm">3.</span><span class="cl">Answer:</span> Indeed, he holds that we punish based on a Kal va'Chomer.</p>
<p class="bas indent1"><span class="nm">(c)</span><span class="cl">(Beraisa - R. Elazar b'Rebbi Shimon):</span> We may kill someone about to desecrate Shabbos.</p>
<p class="bas indent2"><span class="nm">1.</span>He hold like his father, that we punish based on a Kal va'Chomer. He learns Shabbos from a Gezeirah Shavah "Chilul-Chilul" from idolatry:</p>
<p class="bas subject"><span class="nm">3)</span>FOR WHICH TRANSGRESSIONS MUST ONE FORFEIT HIS LIFE?</p>
<p class="bas indent1"><span class="nm">(a)</span><span class="cl">(R. Yochanan):</span> A vote was taken (among Chachamim). They concluded that if one is told to transgress or else be killed, he may (Tosfos; Rambam - must) transgress, with three exceptions - idolatry, Arayos, and murder (he may not transgress any of these).</p>
<p class="bas indent1"><span class="nm">(b)</span><span class="cl">Question:</span> Is idolatry really an exception?!</p>
<p class="bas indent2"><span class="nm">1.</span><span class="cl">(Beraisa - R. Yishmael):</span> If one is told to serve idolatry or be killed, he may (Rambam - must) transgress - "va'Chay Bahem", do not die due to Mitzvos.</p>
<p class="bas indent2"><span class="nm">2.</span><span class="cl">Suggestion:</span> Perhaps this applies even in public!</p>
<p class="bas indent2"><span class="nm">3.</span><span class="cl">Rejection:</span> "V'Lo Sechalelu Es Shem Kodshi v'Nikdashti."</p>
<p class="bas indent1"><span class="nm">(c)</span><span class="cl">Answer:</span> The majority voted that the Halachah follows R. Eliezer.</p>
<p class="bas indent2"><span class="nm">1.</span><span class="cl">(Beraisa - R. Eliezer) Question:</span> Why must it say both "v'Ohavta Es Hash-m Elokecha b'Chol Levavcha <i>uv'Chol Nafshecha</i>" and also "uv'Chol Me'odecha"?</p>
<p class="bas indent2"><span class="nm">2.</span><span class="cl">Answer:</span> If one's Nefesh (life) is dearer to him than his money, he is commanded to love Hash-m (and refuse to serve idolatry), even if he must forfeit his life;</p>
<p class="bas indent2"><span class="nm">3.</span>If his money is dearer to him than his life, he is commanded to love Hash-m, even if he must lose his money.</p>
<p class="bas indent1"><span class="nm">(d)</span>We learn Arayos and murder like Rebbi did.</p>
<p class="bas indent2"><span class="nm">1.</span><span class="cl">(Beraisa - Rebbi) Question:</span> "Ki Ka'asher... u'Retzacho Nefesh" (we do not kill a Na'arah Me'urasah who was raped, like the law of Rotze'ach).</p>
<p class="bas indent2"><span class="nm">2.</span><span class="cl">Question:</span> We do not learn Na'arah Me'orasah from Rotze'ach. It says explicitly that we do not kill her, for she was Anusah!</p>
<p class="bas indent2"><span class="nm">3.</span><span class="cl">Answer:</span> The verse seems to learn Na'arah Me'orasah from Rotze'ach, but really, Na'arah Me'orasah teaches about Rotze'ach;</p>
<p class="bas indent3"><span class="nm">i.</span>It equates Na'arah Me'orasah and Rotze'ach. Just like one can kill one who seeks to rape a Na'arah Me'orasah, one can kill a Rodef.</p>
<p class="bas indent3"><span class="nm">ii.</span>It also equates Rotze'ach to Na'arah Me'orasah. Just like one must forfeit his life and not murder, one must forfeit his life and not transgress Arayos.</p>
<p class="bas indent1"><span class="nm">(e)</span><span class="cl">Question:</span> What is the source that must forfeit his life and not murder?</p>
<p class="bas indent1"><span class="nm">(f)</span><span class="cl">Answer:</span> Reasoning teaches this.</p>
<p class="bas indent2"><span class="nm">1.</span><span class="cl">A man asked Rava:</span> The mayor told me to kill Ploni or be killed. What should I do?</p>
<p class="bas indent2"><span class="nm">2.</span><span class="cl">Rava:</span> Be killed, and do not kill. Perhaps Ploni is more worthy to live than you!</p>
<p class="bas indent1"><span class="nm">(g)</span><span class="cl">(Rav Dimi citing R. Yochanan):</span> We transgress (all Mitzvos except for the three) to save a life. This is only when the king did not decree against the Mitzvos;</p>
<p class="bas indent2"><span class="nm">1.</span>If the king decreed that we must transgress, one may not transgress even a light Mitzvah. He must submit to be killed.</p>
<p class="bas indent1"><span class="nm">(h)</span><span class="cl">(Ravin citing R. Yochanan):</span> Even when the king did not decree, one may not transgress even a light Mitzvah in public. He must submit to be killed.</p>
<p class="bas indent1"><span class="nm">(i)</span><span class="cl">Question:</span> What is considered a light Mitzvah?</p>
<p class="bas indent1"><span class="nm">(j)</span><span class="cl">Answer (Rava bar Rav Yitzchak):</span> Wearing shoelaces like Yisraelim is an example. (Rashi - Yisraelim tie them differently because it is more modest; Rif - Nochrim wear red shoelaces and Yisraelim wear black, to avoid wearing Bigdei Nochrim.)</p>
<p class="bas bbbline">74b----------------------------------------74b</p>
<p class="bas indent1"><span class="nm">(k)</span><span class="cl">Question:</span> What is considered in public?</p>
<p class="bas indent1"><span class="nm">(l)</span><span class="cl">Answer (R. Yakov):</span> It is when at least 10 people are present.</p>
<p class="bas indent2"><span class="nm">1.</span>Obviously, he refers to Yisraelim - "v'Nikdashti b'Soch Bnei Yisrael."</p>
<p class="bas indent1"><span class="nm">(m)</span><span class="cl">Question (R. Yirmeyah):</span> If there are nine Yisraelim and one Nochri, what is the law?</p>
<p class="bas indent1"><span class="nm">(n)</span><span class="cl">Answer (Rav Yanai, brother of R. Chiya bar Aba):</span> We learn from a Gezeirah Shavah "Toch-Toch":</p>
<p class="bas indent2"><span class="nm">1.</span>It says here "v'Nikdashti b'Soch Bnei Yisrael", like it says about the Meraglim "Hibadlu mi'Toch ha'Edah ha'Zos";</p>
<p class="bas indent2"><span class="nm">2.</span>Just like there, there were 10 (evil Meraglim), and all were Yisraelim, also here there must be 10 Yisraelim.</p>
<p class="bas indent1"><span class="nm">(o)</span><span class="cl">Question:</span> Esther was married to Achashverosh in public (i.e. many Yisraelim knew about it. She should have been Moser Nefesh!)</p>
<p class="bas indent1"><span class="nm">(p)</span><span class="cl">Answer #1 (Abaye):</span> She was totally passive (she never did action until she went to the king on Mordechai's command. In such a case, one need not forfeit his life).</p>
<p class="bas indent1"><span class="nm">(q)</span><span class="cl">Answer #2 (Rava):</span> When the Nochri intends for his own benefit, the Yisrael may transgress even in public to save his life.</p>
<p class="bas indent1"><span class="nm">(r)</span><span class="cl">Support (Rava, for himself):</span> On their idolatrous festivals, Nochrim demand that we give to them Kelim with coals (for their rituals). Even though this pertains to idolatry, we give, and we are not Moser Nefesh!</p>
<p class="bas indent2"><span class="nm">1.</span>We must say that since they intend for their own pleasure, it is permitted.</p>
<p class="bas indent1"><span class="nm">(s)</span>This is like Rava taught elsewhere:</p>
<p class="bas indent2"><span class="nm">1.</span><span class="cl">(Rava):</span> If a Nochri told a Yisrael on Shabbos 'cut (attached) fodder and feed my animal, or else I will kill you', he may (Rambam - must) cut it and live;</p>
<p class="bas indent2"><span class="nm">2.</span>If he told him 'cut fodder and throw it in the river, or else I will kill you', he may not cut it.</p>
<p class="bas indent2"><span class="nm">3.</span><span class="cl">Question:</span> What is the reason?</p>
<p class="bas indent2"><span class="nm">4.</span><span class="cl">Answer:</span> In the latter case, the Nochri's sole intent is to make the Yisrael transgress.</p>
<p class="bas subject"><span class="nm">4)</span>ARE BENEI NOACH OBLIGATED IN KIDUSH HASH-M?</p>
<p class="bas indent1"><span class="nm">(a)</span><span class="cl">Question:</span> Are Bnei Noach commanded about Kidush Hash-m?</p>
<p class="bas indent1"><span class="nm">(b)</span><span class="cl">Answer #1 (Abaye - Beraisa):</span> Bnei Noach are commanded about seven Mitzvos;</p>
<p class="bas indent2"><span class="nm">1.</span>If they were commanded about Kidush Hash-m, this would be an eighth!</p>
<p class="bas indent1"><span class="nm">(c)</span><span class="cl">Rejection (Rava):</span> They are commanded about seven Mitzvos and all their ramifications (i.e. this could include forfeiting their lives rather than transgressing one of the seven Mitzvos).</p>
<p class="bas indent1"><span class="nm">(d)</span><span class="cl">Answer #2 (Rav Ada bar Ahavah):</span> "...Yislach Hash-m... Adoni... Nish'an Alai v'Hishtachaveisi" (Na'aman accepted to be a Ger Toshav, and mentioned that he must bow with his master to idolatry). Elisha blessed him "Lech l'Shalom";</p>
<p class="bas indent2"><span class="nm">1.</span>Version #1 (Our text, Rashi) If he were commanded about Kidush Hash-m, Elisha should have protested!</p>
<p class="bas indent2"><span class="nm">2.</span><span class="cl">Rejection:</span> Yisraelim would not see it. Perhaps Bnei Noach are commanded to Mekadesh Hash-m only in front of Yisraelim.</p>
<p class="bas indent2"><span class="nm">3.</span>Version #2 (Tosfos) If he were commanded about Kidush Hash-m, Elisha should have explained that he is permitted only in private, but not in public!</p>
