<p class="bas subject"><span class="nm">1)</span>THE ORDER OF THE EIGHTEEN <i>BERACHOS</i></p>
<p class="bas indent1"><span class="nm">(a)</span>Acceptance of prayer - "I will bring them to My Kodesh mountain and make them rejoice in My house of prayer."</p>
<p class="bas indent1"><span class="nm">(b)</span>Avodah - the previous verse continues "Oloseihem v'Zivcheihem".</p>
<p class="bas indent1"><span class="nm">(c)</span>Hoda'ah - follows Avodah, for "Zevach Todah Yechabdaneni."</p>
<p class="bas indent1"><span class="nm">(d)</span>Birkas Kohanim - because "Aharon blessed the people ... Me'asos (from having done) ha'Chatas... "</p>
<p class="bas indent2"><span class="nm">1.</span><span class="cl">Question:</span> If so, Birkas Kohanim should follow Avodah!</p>
<p class="bas indent2"><span class="nm">2.</span><span class="cl">Answer:</span> Hoda'ah follows Avodah, for "Zevach Todah Yechabdaneni."</p>
<p class="bas indent2"><span class="nm">3.</span><span class="cl">Question:</span> Why does that override the verse of Aharon?</p>
<p class="bas indent2"><span class="nm">4.</span><span class="cl">Answer:</span> Avodah and Hoda'ah are one matter.</p>
<p class="bas indent1"><span class="nm">(e)</span>Shalom follows Birkas Kohanim, because "They will put my name on Yisrael, and I will bless them"; Hash-m's Berachah is Shalom.</p>
<p class="bas indent1"><span class="nm">(f)</span><span class="cl">Question:</span> If Nevi'im were among the Chachamim who ordered the Berachos, why did Shimon ha'Pekuli need to order them? (Yavneh was 400 years after the last Nevi'im!)</p>
<p class="bas indent1"><span class="nm">(g)</span><span class="cl">Answer:</span> The order was forgotten, and he re-established it.</p>
<p class="bas indent1"><span class="nm">(h)</span>One may not compose a Berachah on his own.</p>
<p class="bas indent2"><span class="nm">1.</span><span class="cl">(R. Elazar):</span> "Who will recount Gevuros Hash-m and make known all His praise?" (Only) one who can make known all His praise is fitting to recount His great acts (we should rely on Berachos that Chachamim composed).</p>
<p class="bas indent2"><span class="nm">2.</span><span class="cl">(Rabah bar bar Chanah):</span> One who discusses Hash-m's praise too much is uprooted from the world.</p>
<p class="bas indent2"><span class="nm">3.</span><span class="cl">(R. Yehudah of Giborya):</span> "To You, silence is praise" - the best spice (to praise Hash-m) is silence (because one cannot recount all His praise).</p>
<p class="bas indent2"><span class="nm">4.</span><span class="cl">(Rav Dimi):</span> In Eretz Yisrael, they say that one should pay twice as much for silence as for a word.</p>
<p class="bas subject"><span class="nm">2)</span>ONE MUST READ FROM A <i>MEGILAH</i> WRITTEN IN <i>ASHURIS</i></p>
<p class="bas indent1"><span class="nm">(a)</span><span class="cl">(Mishnah):</span> If one read by heart, he was not Yotzei.</p>
<p class="bas indent2"><span class="nm">1.</span><span class="cl">(Rava):</span> We learn this from a Gezeirah Shavah Zechirah-Zechirah from remembering Amalek, which must be in a Sefer.</p>
<p class="bas indent2"><span class="nm">2.</span><span class="cl">Question:</span> How do we know that Zechirah regarding Amalek is reciting it? Perhaps it suffices to think about it!</p>
<p class="bas indent2"><span class="nm">3.</span><span class="cl">Answer:</span> "Remember, don't forget" - forgetting is in the heart, so "remember" must come to obligate reciting it.</p>
<p class="bas indent1"><span class="nm">(b)</span><span class="cl">(Mishnah):</span> One who reads an Arameic translation was not Yotzei.</p>
<p class="bas indent2"><span class="nm">1.</span><span class="cl">Question:</span> If it is written in Hebrew and he reads it in Arameic, this is by heart (so why was it needed to teach this)!</p>
<p class="bas indent2"><span class="nm">2.</span><span class="cl">Conclusion:</span> Rather, even if it was written and read in Arameic, he was not Yotzei.</p>
<p class="bas indent1"><span class="nm">(c)</span><span class="cl">(Mishnah):</span> We may read in La'az to a Lo'ez.</p>
<p class="bas indent1"><span class="nm">(d)</span><span class="cl">Question:</span> The Mishnah said that one who reads in any language was not Yotzei!</p>
<p class="bas indent1"><span class="nm">(e)</span><span class="cl">Answer: (Rav and Shmuel):</span> One is Yotzei in Yevanis.</p>
<p class="bas indent2"><span class="nm">1.</span><span class="cl">Question:</span> If it was written in Ashuris, and he read in Yevanis, that is by heart!</p>
<p class="bas indent2"><span class="nm">2.</span><span class="cl">Answer (R. Acha citing R. Elazar):</span> It was written in Yevanis.</p>
<p class="bas indent2"><span class="nm">3.</span><span class="cl">(R. Acha citing R. Elazar):</span> "Va'Yikra Lo El Elokei Yisrael" - Hash-m called Yakov 'El'. Had Yakov called the Mizbe'ach 'El', it would have said "Yakov called ..." (the Gemara teaches together Rav Acha's teachings in the name of R. Elazar).</p>
<p class="bas indent1"><span class="nm">(f)</span><span class="cl">Question (Beraisa):</span> One who read in Giftis, Ivris, Ilmis, Midis or Yevanis was not Yotzei.</p>
<p class="bas indent1"><span class="nm">(g)</span><span class="cl">Answer #1:</span> That is if he does not understand the language. Rav and Shmuel discuss one who understands Yevanis;</p>
<p class="bas indent2"><span class="nm">1.</span><span class="cl">(Beraisa):</span> If speakers of Giftis, Ivris, Ilmis or Yevanis heard in their language, they were Yotzei.</p>
<p class="bas indent1"><span class="nm">(h)</span><span class="cl">Objection:</span> Why did Rav and Shmuel discuss Yevanis if the same applies to any language?!</p>
<p class="bas indent1"><span class="nm">(i)</span><span class="cl">Answer #2:</span> Rav and Shmuel teach that anyone is Yotzei in Yevanis. They did not come to explain the Mishnah. The Mishnah discusses one who understands the language.</p>
<p class="bas indent1"><span class="nm">(j)</span><span class="cl">Question (Beraisa):</span> (Only) Yevanim are Yotzei in Yevanis.</p>
<p class="bas indent1"><span class="nm">(k)</span><span class="cl">Answer:</span> Rav and Shmuel hold like R. Shimon ben Gamliel, who permits writing Seforim in Yevanis.</p>
<p class="bas indent1"><span class="nm">(l)</span><span class="cl">Question:</span> If so, they should have said 'the Halachah follows R. Shimon ben Gamliel!'</p>
<p class="bas indent1"><span class="nm">(m)</span><span class="cl">Answer:</span> If so, we would have thought that they permit Yevanis for other Seforim, but not for Megilas Esther, which says "Ki'Chsavam". Therefore, they explicitly taught that one is Yotzei Keri'as ha'Megilah in Yevanis.</p>
<p class="bas indent1"><span class="nm">(n)</span><span class="cl">(Mishnah):</span> A Lo'ez who heard Ashuris was Yotzei.</p>
<p class="bas indent1"><span class="nm">(o)</span><span class="cl">Question:</span> He doesn't understand it!</p>
<p class="bas indent1"><span class="nm">(p)</span><span class="cl">Answer:</span> One is Yotzei even without understanding, like women and Amei ha'Aretz.</p>
<p class="bas indent1"><span class="nm">(q)</span><span class="cl">Objection (Ravina):</span> Even we (Chachamim) do not know what "ha'Achashteranim Benei ha'Ramachim" means! Rather, one publicizes the miracle by reading it, even without understanding.</p>
<p class="bas subject"><span class="nm">3)</span>READING INTERMITTENTLY</p>
<p class="bas indent1"><span class="nm">(a)</span><span class="cl">(Mishnah):</span> One who read Seirugin (intermittently) was Yotzei.</p>
<p class="bas indent1"><span class="nm">(b)</span>Chachamim didn't know the meaning of the following words until they overheard Rebbi's maid-servant say them, then they understood from context.</p>
<p class="bas indent2"><span class="nm">1.</span>Seirugin - with pauses in the middle.</p>
<p class="bas indent2"><span class="nm">2.</span>Chaluglagos - portulak (a type of vegetable).</p>
<p class="bas indent2"><span class="nm">3.</span>Salsalah - turn about.</p>
<p class="bas indent2"><span class="nm">4.</span>Yehavcha - your burden.</p>
<p class="bas indent2"><span class="nm">5.</span>Titasiha - I swept it.</p>
<p class="bas bbbline">18b----------------------------------------18b</p>
<p class="bas indent1"><span class="nm">(c)</span><span class="cl">(Beraisa):</span> One who read intermittently was Yotzei, but not if he read out of order;</p>
<p class="bas indent1"><span class="nm">(d)</span><span class="cl">(R. Muna):</span> If he paused long enough to finish it, he was not Yotzei.</p>
<p class="bas indent1"><span class="nm">(e)</span><span class="cl">(Rav Yosef):</span> The Halachah follows R. Muna.</p>
<p class="bas indent1"><span class="nm">(f)</span><span class="cl">Question (Abaye):</span> Does 'to finish it' mean from where he paused, or from beginning to end?</p>
<p class="bas indent1"><span class="nm">(g)</span><span class="cl">Answer (Rav Yosef):</span> It is from beginning to end. If not, the Shi'ur would vary according to where he paused (and this is unreasonable)!</p>
<p class="bas indent1"><span class="nm">(h)</span><span class="cl">(R. Aba):</span> In Sura they taught that Rav says that the Halachah follows R. Muna and that Shmuel disagrees. In Pumbedisa Rav Kahana also taught like this, but Rav Bivi taught oppositely, i.e. Shmuel rules like R. Muna and Rav disagrees.</p>
<p class="bas indent1"><span class="nm">(i)</span><span class="cl">(Rav Yosef):</span> One should follow Rav Bivi, for we know that Shmuel is concerned for the opinion of an individual.</p>
<p class="bas indent2"><span class="nm">1.</span><span class="cl">(Mishnah - R. Yehudah ben Beseirah):</span> If Reuven was Mekadesh the sister of his Yevamah, we tell him to wait until his brother does Yibum or Chalitzah. Afterwards, Reuven may make Nisu'in.</p>
<p class="bas indent2"><span class="nm">2.</span><span class="cl">(Shmuel):</span> The Halachah follows R. Yehudah ben Beseirah.</p>
<p class="bas indent1"><span class="nm">(j)</span><span class="cl">(Beraisa #1):</span> If the scribe omitted letters or verses, and the reader said them like a translator (by heart), he was Yotzei.</p>
<p class="bas indent1"><span class="nm">(k)</span><span class="cl">Question (Beraisa #2):</span> If letters were faded or torn:</p>
<p class="bas indent2"><span class="nm">1.</span>If their image is recognizable, it is Kosher; if not, not.</p>
<p class="bas indent1"><span class="nm">(l)</span><span class="cl">Answer:</span> It is Kosher if it is partially, but not if it is totally (Rambam - mostly faded or torn).</p>
<p class="bas indent1"><span class="nm">(m)</span><span class="cl">(Beraisa):</span> If the reader omitted a verse, he may not finish and later say the verse; rather, he returns to that verse and reads in order;</p>
<p class="bas indent1"><span class="nm">(n)</span>If one enters a Beis ha'Keneses in the middle of the reading, he may not hear the second half and later read the first half. Rather, he reads the entire Megilah in order.</p>
<p class="bas indent1"><span class="nm">(o)</span><span class="cl">(Mishnah):</span> One who dozed in the middle was Yotzei.</p>
<p class="bas indent1"><span class="nm">(p)</span><span class="cl">(Rav Ashi):</span> 'Dozing' is half asleep, half awake. If one calls to him he responds, but he cannot answer anything that requires understanding.</p>
<p class="bas subject"><span class="nm">4)</span><i>HALACHOS</i> OF WRITING THE <i>MEGILAH</i></p>
<p class="bas indent1"><span class="nm">(a)</span><span class="cl">(Mishnah):</span> If one was writing, expounding or proofreading, he was Yotzei only if he intended.</p>
<p class="bas indent1"><span class="nm">(b)</span><span class="cl">Question:</span> If he said each verse by memory before writing it he should not be Yotzei, for this is by heart!</p>
<p class="bas indent1"><span class="nm">(c)</span><span class="cl">Answer:</span> Rather, he said each verse after writing it.</p>
<p class="bas indent1"><span class="nm">(d)</span><span class="cl">Question:</span> R. Chelbo said that (the Halachah follows the opinion that requires reading the entire Megilah, and) all agree that the entire Megilah must be written!</p>
<p class="bas indent1"><span class="nm">(e)</span><span class="cl">Answer:</span> Rather, a complete Megilah was in front of him, and he read from it while he wrote.</p>
<p class="bas indent1"><span class="nm">(f)</span><span class="cl">(Rabah bar bar Chanah):</span> One may copy, but one may not write even one letter from memory.</p>
<p class="bas indent1"><span class="nm">(g)</span><span class="cl">Suggestion:</span> Our Mishnah supports this. This is why a Megilah was in front of him!</p>
<p class="bas indent1"><span class="nm">(h)</span><span class="cl">Rejection:</span> Perhaps the law is not true. The Mishnah discusses whether or not he is Yotzei in such a case.</p>
<p class="bas indent1"><span class="nm">(i)</span><span class="cl">Question (Beraisa):</span> R. Meir went to Asya to make a leap year. There was not a Megilah there, so he wrote one from memory, and read it.</p>
<p class="bas indent1"><span class="nm">(j)</span><span class="cl">Answer (R. Avahu):</span> R. Meir is an exception. Normally, "If you close your eyes on it (Torah) it is gone". Regarding R. Meir, "(Even when) your eyelids (are closed) it is straight in front of you".</p>
<p class="bas indent1"><span class="nm">(k)</span>Rav Chisda found Rav Chananel writing by memory. He said "the whole Torah is proper to be written through your mouth, but Chachamim forbade to write by heart."</p>
<p class="bas indent2"><span class="nm">1.</span><span class="cl">Question:</span> The praise shows that he does not forget. Why was R. Meir different?</p>
<p class="bas indent2"><span class="nm">2.</span><span class="cl">Answer:</span> R. Meir's case was a pressed circumstance; there was no other solution.</p>
<p class="bas indent1"><span class="nm">(l)</span>Abaye allowed people of Bar Chavo's house to write from memory. He holds like a different Tana.</p>
<p class="bas indent2"><span class="nm">1.</span><span class="cl">(Beraisa - R. Yirmeyah):</span> Tefilin and Mezuzos may be written by heart, and do not require Sirtut (scratch lines to ensure straight writing).</p>
<p class="bas indent2"><span class="nm">2.</span>The Halachah is, Tefilin doesn't need Sirtut, but Mezuzos do. Both may be written by heart, because everybody is familiar with (the verses written in) them.</p>
<p class="bas indent1"><span class="nm">(m)</span><span class="cl">(Mishnah):</span> If it was written with Sam ... only ink is Kosher.</p>
<p class="bas indent1"><span class="nm">(n)</span>The Mishnah disqualified a Megilah written with Sam, Sikra, Kumus, or Kankantom. These are paint, a red dye, tree sap, and a paint used for shoes, respectively.</p>
