<div class="subject"><span class="nm">1)</span><p>MAY A TAMEI MES SEND HIS KORBAN PESACH?</p></div>
<div class="indent1"><span class="nm">(a)</span><p><span class="cl">Question:</span> "Ish l'Fi Achlo Tachoso Al ha'Seh" (we slaughter Pesach only for those who can eat it)!</p></div>
<div class="indent1"><span class="nm">(b)</span><p><span class="cl">Answer:</span> That is only l'Chatchilah.</p></div>
<div class="indent1"><span class="nm">(c)</span><p><span class="cl">Question:</span> It is Me'akev!</p></div>
<div class="indent2"><span class="nm">1.</span><p><span class="cl">(Beraisa):</span> "B'Michsas Nefashos" teaches that we slaughter Pesach only for those who can eat it;</p></div>
<div class="indent3"><span class="nm">i.</span><p><span class="cl">Suggestion:</span> One may not slaughter for people who do not own a share, but if one did, the Korban is Kosher.</p></div>
<div class="indent3"><span class="nm">ii.</span><p><span class="cl">Rejection:</span> "Tachoso" is repeated to teach that it is Me'akev.</p></div>
<div class="indent2"><span class="nm">2.</span><p><span class="cl">Summation of question:</span> People who do not own a share are equated to people who cannot eat it, i.e. if it was slaughtered for them, it is Pasul!</p></div>
<div class="indent1"><span class="nm">(d)</span><p><span class="cl">Answer:</span> Ziknei Darom do not equate people who do not own a share with people who cannot eat it.</p></div>
<div class="indent1"><span class="nm">(e)</span><p><span class="cl">Question:</span> Even if they do not equate them, we have a question!</p></div>
<div class="indent2"><span class="nm">1.</span><p>An owner who is Tamei Sheretz may send his Korban l'Chatchilah, but a Tamei Sheretz Kohen is Mechalel Avodah;</p></div>
<div class="indent2"><span class="nm">2.</span><p>An owner who is Tamei Mes should not send his Korban (he should wait until Pesach Sheni). All the more so a Tamei Mes Kohen is Mechalel Avodah!</p></div>
<div class="indent1"><span class="nm">(f)</span><p><span class="cl">Question (against Ziknei Darom - Beraisa):</span> The Tzitz is Meratzeh (makes acceptable) Korban Pesach or Korbanos of a Nazir if the blood became Tamei, but not if he (the owner) is Tamei.</p></div>
<div class="indent2"><span class="nm">1.</span><p><span class="cl">Question:</span> What is his Tum'ah?</p></div>
<div class="indent2"><span class="nm">2.</span><p><span class="cl">Answer #1:</span> He is Tamei Sheretz.</p></div>
<div class="indent2"><span class="nm">3.</span><p><span class="cl">Rejection:</span> Ziknei Darom hold that we offer the Korban (Pesach) of a Tamei Sheretz. (It is Kosher even without the Tzitz!)</p></div>
<div class="indent2"><span class="nm">4.</span><p><span class="cl">Answer #2:</span> He is Tamei Mes.</p></div>
<div class="indent3"><span class="nm">i.</span><p><span class="cl">Summation of question:</span> The Beraisa teaches that the Tzitz is not Meratzeh. This implies that a Tamei Mes may not send his Korban!</p></div>
<div class="indent1"><span class="nm">(g)</span><p><span class="cl">Answer:</span> If the owner was Tamei Mes, indeed the Tzitz is Meratzeh. The Beraisa does not discuss this;</p></div>
<div class="indent2"><span class="nm">1.</span><p>Rather, it says 'not if <i>he</i> was Tamei', i.e. the <i>Kohen</i> who offered it was Tamei Sheretz.</p></div>
<div class="indent1"><span class="nm">(h)</span><p><span class="cl">Question (Seifa of the Beraisa):</span> If he became Tamei through Tum'as ha'Tehom (a Tum'ah that no one knew about), the Tzitz is Meratzeh.</p></div>
<div class="indent2"><span class="nm">1.</span><p>R. Chiya taught, Tum'as ha'Tehom is Meratzeh only for Tum'as Mes!</p></div>
<div class="indent2"><span class="nm">2.</span><p><span class="cl">Question:</span> What does R. Chiya comes to exclude?</p></div>
<div class="indent3"><span class="nm">i.</span><p><span class="cl">Suggestion:</span> He excludes Tum'as Sheretz.</p></div>
<div class="indent1"><span class="nm">(i)</span><p><span class="cl">Answer:</span> No, he excludes Tum'as Zivah.</p></div>
<div class="indent1"><span class="nm">(j)</span><p><span class="cl">Question:</span> Rami bar Chama asked whether or not Tum'as ha'Tehom is permitted to a Kohen offering Korbanos;</p></div>
<div class="indent2"><span class="nm">1.</span><p>If our Beraisa discusses Tum'as ha'Tehom of the Kohen, he should have been able to resolve his question!</p></div>
<div class="indent1"><span class="nm">(k)</span><p><span class="cl">Answer:</span> Rami bar Chama argues with Ziknei Darom. (Rami holds that we do not offer the Korban of a Tamei Mes, for being able to eat is Me'akev Pesach. He establishes the Beraisa to teach about Tum'ah of the owner.)</p></div>
<div class="indent1"><span class="nm">(l)</span><p><span class="cl">Version #1 - Question (against Rami bar Chama - Beraisa):</span> "V'Nasa Aharon Es Avon ha'Kodoshim";</p></div>
<div class="indent2"><span class="nm">1.</span><p><span class="cl">Question:</span> What sin does the (Tzitz on the) Kohen Gadol sustain?</p></div>
<div class="bbbline">23b----------------------------------------23b</p></div>
<div class="indent3"><span class="nm">i.</span><p>It cannot be Pigul (here this refers a Korban offered with intent Chutz li'Mkomo, even though there is no Kares for eating it). We learn that from "Lo Yechashev" (Rashi - from "Lo Yeratzeh")!</p></div>
<div class="indent3"><span class="nm">ii.</span><p>It cannot be Nosar. (Note - really, Nosar is a Korban that was not eaten in the permitted time. Here, it refers to a Korban <i>offered with intent to eat it when it is</i> Nosar, i.e. Chutz li'Zmano, what the Torah calls Pigul.) We learn that from "Lo Yeratzeh" (Rashi - from "Lo Yechashev")!</p></div>
<div class="indent2"><span class="nm">2.</span><p><span class="cl">Answer:</span> It bears the sin of a Tum'ah permitted to the Tzibur.</p></div>
<div class="indent2"><span class="nm">3.</span><p><span class="cl">Question:</span> Which Tum'ah is this?</p></div>
<div class="indent3"><span class="nm">i.</span><p><span class="cl">Suggestion:</span> It is Tum'as Sheretz.</p></div>
<div class="indent3"><span class="nm">ii.</span><p><span class="cl">Rejection:</span> That is never permitted to the Tzibur (since a Tamei Sheretz can send his Korban and eat it in Taharah at night; Tosfos - or, if Rami holds that a Tamei Sheretz may not send his Korban, the Tzitz is not Meratzeh)!</p></div>
<div class="indent2"><span class="nm">4.</span><p><span class="cl">Answer #1:</span> It bears Tum'as Mes.</p></div>
<div class="indent3"><span class="nm">i.</span><p><span class="cl">Suggestion:</span> The case is, the owners became Tamei.</p></div>
<div class="indent3"><span class="nm">ii.</span><p><span class="cl">Inference:</span> A Tamei Mes may send his Korban (and the Tzitz is Meratzeh).</p></div>
<div class="indent2"><span class="nm">5.</span><p><span class="cl">Question:</span> To which Korban does this apply?</p></div>
<div class="indent3"><span class="nm">i.</span><p>It cannot be a Nazir's Korban, for it says "v'Chi Yamus Mes Alav"! (He must repeat Nezirus before bringing his Korbanos. We cannot say that it applies to a Nazir Tamei, for this would not require the Tzitz to be Meratzeh. He need not be Tahor when his Korbanos are offered, just like Stam Olos or Shelamim which may be offered when the owner is Tamei!)</p></div>
<div class="indent2"><span class="nm">6.</span><p><span class="cl">Answer:</span> It applies to Korban Pesach.</p></div>
<div class="indent1"><span class="nm">(m)</span><p><span class="cl">Answer (and Answer #2 to Question 3):</span> Really, he is Tamei Sheretz. The Beraisa means that it bears the sin of Tum'ah, (albeit not the same kind) which is permitted to the Tzibur.</p></div>
<div class="indent1"><span class="nm">(n)</span><p><span class="cl">Version #2 - Question (against Ziknei Darom):</span> "V'Nasa Aharon Es Avon <i>ha'Kodoshim</i>" - he does not bear the sin of the <i>Makdishim</i> (not of the owner, who was Makdish the Korban, nor of the Kohanim who offered it).</p></div>
<div class="indent2"><span class="nm">1.</span><p><span class="cl">Question:</span> Which Tum'ah does it discuss?</p></div>
<div class="indent3"><span class="nm">i.</span><p><span class="cl">Suggestion:</span> It discusses Tum'as Sheretz.</p></div>
<div class="indent3"><span class="nm">ii.</span><p><span class="cl">Version #1 (Rashi) Rejection:</span> That is never permitted to the Tzibur (i.e. the Kohanim. The owners do not need Ritzuy Tzitz, for a Tamei Sheretz may send his Korban and eat it at night b'Taharah!)</p></div>
<div class="indent3"><span class="nm">iii.</span><p><span class="cl">Version #2 (Tosfos) Rejection:</span> That is never permitted to the owners (if a Tamei Sheretz may send his Korban, he must eat it at night b'Taharah. If he may not send his Korban, the Tzibur does not need the Tzitz to send Pesach Rishon (since they are not pushed off to Pesach Sheni), and the Tzitz does not permit an individual!)</p></div>
<div class="indent2"><span class="nm">2.</span><p><span class="cl">Answer #1:</span> It discusses Tum'as Mes.</p></div>
<div class="indent3"><span class="nm">i.</span><p><span class="cl">Summation of question:</span> It does not bear the sin of the Makdishim. I.e. a Tamei Mes owner may not send his Korban, and a Tamei Mes Kohen is Mechalel Avodah in an individual's Korban.</p></div>
<div class="indent1"><span class="nm">(o)</span><p><span class="cl">Answer (and Answer #2 to Question 1):</span> Really, he is Tamei Sheretz. The Beraisa means that it bears the sin of Tum'ah, (albeit not the same kind) which is permitted to the Tzibur.</p></div>
<div class="subject"><span class="nm">2)</span><p><i>AVODAH</i> MUST BE DONE STANDING</p></div>
<div class="indent1"><span class="nm">(a)</span><p><span class="cl">(Mishnah):</span> One who sits (is Mechalel Avodah).</p></div>
<div class="indent1"><span class="nm">(b)</span><p><span class="cl">Question:</span> What is the source of this?</p></div>
<div class="indent1"><span class="nm">(c)</span><p><span class="cl">Answer (Rava):</span> "(Bo Bachar Hash-m) La'amod Leshares" - Kohanim were chosen to serve standing, not sitting.</p></div>
<div class="indent1"><span class="nm">(d)</span><p><span class="cl">(Beraisa):</span> "La'amod Leshares" teaches that L'Chatchilah, Avodah must be standing;</p></div>
<div class="indent2"><span class="nm">1.</span><p>"Ha'Omedim" - the repetition teaches that it is Me'akev.</p></div>
<div class="indent1"><span class="nm">(e)</span><p><span class="cl">Suggestion (Rava):</span> One who sits is like a Zar, and he is Mechalel Avodah. We should say that just like a Zar is Chayav Misah for Avodah, also one who sits!</p></div>
<div class="indent2"><span class="nm">1.</span><p><span class="cl">(Beraisa):</span> An Arel, Onen or sitting Kohen is not Chayav Misah for Avodah, but he transgresses a Lav.</p></div>
<div class="indent1"><span class="nm">(f)</span><p><span class="cl">Answer (Rav Nachman):</span> Separate verses teach that Mechusar Begadim and one who did not wash are Chayav Misah (for Avodah). One of these could have been learned from the other;</p></div>
<div class="indent2"><span class="nm">1.</span><p>Whenever there are two verses, and one of them teaches something that could have been learned from the other, we do not learn from them to other cases. (Had the Torah wanted us to learn to other cases, it would have written only one verse!)</p></div>
<div class="indent1"><span class="nm">(g)</span><p><span class="cl">Question:</span> According to the opinion that we do learn from two such verses, how can we answer?</p></div>
<div class="indent1"><span class="nm">(h)</span><p><span class="cl">Answer:</span> There is a third such verse about Shtuyei Yayin. All agree that we do not learn from three such verses.</p></div>
