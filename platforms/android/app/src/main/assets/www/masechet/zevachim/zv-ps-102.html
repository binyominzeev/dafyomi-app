<div class="indent1"><span class="nm">(a)</span><p><span class="cl">Question (Beraisa) Question:</span> Who was <i>Masgir</i> Miryam (ruled that she is a Metzora'as)?</p></div>
<div class="indent2"><span class="nm">1.</span><p>Moshe did not, for he is a Zar. A Zar cannot rule about Tzara'as!</p></div>
<div class="indent2"><span class="nm">2.</span><p>Aharon did not, for he is a relative. A relative cannot rule about Tzara'as!</p></div>
<div class="indent2"><span class="nm">3.</span><p><span class="cl">Answer:</span> Hash-m Himself honored her and ruled about her;</p></div>
<div class="indent3"><span class="nm">i.</span><p>He said 'I am a Kohen. I will be Masgir, Machlit (declare her to be absolutely Teme'ah) and exempt her (when the Tzara'as leaves).</p></div>
<div class="indent2"><span class="nm">4.</span><p><span class="cl">Summation of question:</span> It says that Moshe is a Zar!</p></div>
<div class="indent1"><span class="nm">(b)</span><p><span class="cl">Answer (Rav Nachman bar Yitzchak):</span> Tzara'as is different, for it says "Aharon u'Vanav" in the Parshah. (Otherwise, Moshe is considered a Kohen.)</p></div>
<div class="indent1"><span class="nm">(c)</span><p><span class="cl">Question (Beraisa):</span> Elisheva (Aharon's wife) had five special causes for joy on the day the Mishkan was inaugurated:</p></div>
<div class="indent2"><span class="nm">1.</span><p>Her Yavam (brother-in-law, i.e. Moshe) was king. Her husband was Kohen Gadol, her son (Elazar) was the Segan (next in line to be Kohen Gadol). Her grandson (Pinchas) was Mashu'ach Milchamah. Her brother (Nachshon) was the Nasi of a Shevet (Yehudah);</p></div>
<div class="indent2"><span class="nm">2.</span><p>At the time, she mourned the loss of two of her sons (Nadav and Avihu).</p></div>
<div class="indent2"><span class="nm">3.</span><p><span class="cl">Summation of question:</span> It says that her Yavam was king, but not Kohen Gadol!</p></div>
<div class="indent1"><span class="nm">(d)</span><p><span class="cl">Answer:</span> It means that he was <i>even</i> king (and also Kohen Gadol)!</p></div>
<div class="indent1"><span class="nm">(e)</span><p>Tana'im argue about whether he was Kohen Gadol;</p></div>
<div class="indent2"><span class="nm">1.</span><p><span class="cl">(Beraisa - R. Yehoshua ben Korchah):</span> "Va'Yichar Af Hash-m b'Moshe (when Moshe was refusing to redeem Bnei Yisrael)" is the only place where 'Charon Af' is not followed by a show of anger;</p></div>
<div class="indent2"><span class="nm">2.</span><p>R. Shimon says, also here it is followed by anger - "Aharon Achicha ha'Levi";</p></div>
<div class="indent3"><span class="nm">i.</span><p><span class="cl">Question:</span> He was a Kohen, and not (just) a Levi!</p></div>
<div class="indent3"><span class="nm">ii.</span><p><span class="cl">Answer:</span> Hash-m rebuked Moshe 'I intended to make you the Kohen, and Aharon would be a Levi. Now (because you refused), you will be a Levi, and he will be Kohen.'</p></div>
<div class="indent2"><span class="nm">3.</span><p>Chachamim say, Moshe was a Kohen only during the seven days of Milu'im (inauguration of the Mishkan);</p></div>
<div class="indent2"><span class="nm">4.</span><p>Some say, the Kehunah ceased only from Moshe's descendants, but he was permanently a Kohen;</p></div>
<div class="indent3"><span class="nm">i.</span><p>It says "u'Moshe Ish ha'Elokim Banav Yikar'u Al Shevet ha'Levi", and "Moshe v'Aharon b'Chohanav..."</p></div>
<div class="indent3"><span class="nm">ii.</span><p><span class="cl">Question:</span> Why is the second verse needed? (The first verse connotes that his children were Leviyim, but Moshe himself was a Kohen!)</p></div>
<div class="indent3"><span class="nm">iii.</span><p><span class="cl">Answer:</span> The former verse teaches lineage for generations. One might have thought that the reason it taught only about Moshe's descendants is because only this was relevant (Moshe was not alive at the time). The second verse proves that he was a Kohen.</p></div>
<div class="subject"><span class="nm">2)</span><p>HONORING THE KING</p></div>
<div class="indent1"><span class="nm">(a)</span><p><span class="cl">Question:</span> Also in another place, 'Charon Af' is not followed by a show of anger! It says "va'Yeztei me'Im Paro ba'Chari Af", yet Moshe did not say anything to him!</p></div>
<div class="indent1"><span class="nm">(b)</span><p><span class="cl">Answer (Reish Lakish):</span> He slapped his face before leaving.</p></div>
<div class="indent1"><span class="nm">(c)</span><p><span class="cl">Question:</span> This contradicts another teaching of Reish Lakish!</p></div>
<div class="indent2"><span class="nm">1.</span><p><span class="cl">(Reish Lakish):</span> "V'Nitzavta Likraso Al Sefas ha'Ye'or" - Hash-m told Moshe 'Paro is a king. You must prepare to greet him properly.'</p></div>
<div class="indent2"><span class="nm">2.</span><p><span class="cl">(R. Yochanan):</span> Hash-m said 'he is a Rasha. You must be brazen with him.'</p></div>
<div class="indent1"><span class="nm">(d)</span><p><span class="cl">Answer:</span> We must switch these teachings of Reish Lakish and R. Yochanan.</p></div>
<div class="indent1"><span class="nm">(e)</span><p><span class="cl">(R. Yanai):</span> The fear of the kingdom should be upon you - "v'Yardu Chol Avadecha Eleh Elai." Moshe omitted saying that also Paro would bow to Moshe and ask him to take Bnei Yisrael from Mitzrayim.</p></div>
<div class="indent1"><span class="nm">(f)</span><p><span class="cl">(R. Yochanan):</span> We learn from "...Eliyahu va'Yeshanes Masnav va'Yaratz Lifnei Achav" (Rashi - in order that Achav not be alone; Radak, Maharsha - he ran in front of him to honor him.)</p></div>
<div class="indent1"><span class="nm">(g)</span><p><span class="cl">(Ula):</span> Moshe requested kingship, but it was not given to him - "Al Tikrav Halom";</p></div>
<div class="indent2"><span class="nm">1.</span><p>"Halom" refers to kingship - "(David asked) Mi Anochi... Ki Havi'osani Ad Halom".</p></div>

<div class="indent1"><span class="nm">(i)</span><p><span class="cl">Answer (Rava):</span> Ula means that Moshe requested kingship for him and his descendants (but it was given only to him).</p></div>
<div class="indent1"><span class="nm">(j)</span><p><span class="cl">Question:</span> 'Halom' does not always refer to all generations!</p></div>

<div class="indent1"><span class="nm">(k)</span><p><span class="cl">Answer #1:</span> Also his son Ish Boshes was king.</p></div>
<div class="indent1"><span class="nm">(l)</span><p><span class="cl">Answer #2:</span> Hash-m gave kingship to him and his descendants, but Sha'ul forfeited it.</p></div>
<div class="indent2"><span class="nm">1.</span><p><span class="cl">(R. Elazar):</span> When greatness is given to a person, it is for him and his descendants for all generations - "Lo Yigra mi'Tzadik Einav v'Es Melachim la'Kisei (va'Yoshivem la'Netzach)";</p></div>
