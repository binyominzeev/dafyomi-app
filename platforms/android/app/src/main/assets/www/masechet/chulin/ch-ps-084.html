<div class="indent1"><span class="nm">(a)</span><p><span class="cl">Answer #1:</span> Indeed, we cover blood of Korbanos ha'Of in this way;</p></div>
<div class="indent2"><span class="nm">1.</span><p>The Mishnah teaches that Kisuy ha'Dam does not apply to Kodshim of Bedek ha'Bayis (for they may not be eaten).</p></div>
<div class="indent2"><span class="nm">2.</span><p><span class="cl">Question:</span> Since we can redeem them (and eat them), we should do Kisuy!</p></div>
<div class="indent2"><span class="nm">3.</span><p><span class="cl">Answer:</span> Redemption of animals requires Ha'amadah and Ha'arachah (standing it up before a Kohen for appraisal). This cannot be done after Shechitah.</p></div>
<div class="indent2"><span class="nm">4.</span><p><span class="cl">Question:</span> Like whom is the Mishnah?</p></div>
<div class="indent3"><span class="nm">i.</span><p><span class="cl">Suggestion:</span> It is like R. Meir, who holds that even Kodshim of Bedek ha'Bayis require Ha'amadah and Ha'arachah.</p></div>
<div class="indent3"><span class="nm">ii.</span><p><span class="cl">Rejection:</span> He holds that even if Shechitah does not permit the meat to be eaten, it is considered Shechitah (and we must cover the blood)!</p></div>
<div class="indent3"><span class="nm">iii.</span><p><span class="cl">Suggestion:</span> The Mishnah is like R. Shimon, who says that Shechitah that does not permit is not considered Shechitah (so Kisuy is not needed).</p></div>
<div class="indent3"><span class="nm">iv.</span><p><span class="cl">Rejection:</span> He holds that Kodshei Bedek ha'Bayis do not require Ha'amadah and Ha'arachah!</p></div>
<div class="indent2"><span class="nm">5.</span><p><span class="cl">Answer #1 (Rav Yosef):</span> The Mishnah is like Rebbi;</p></div>
<div class="indent3"><span class="nm">i.</span><p>Rebbi holds like R. Shimon regarding Shechitah that does not permit (it is not considered Shechitah), and like R. Meir regarding redemption of Kodshei Bedek ha'Bayis.</p></div>
<div class="indent2"><span class="nm">6.</span><p><span class="cl">Answer #2:</span> The Mishnah is like R. Shimon. A verse teaches that the blood must be fit to be covered immediately;</p></div>
<div class="indent3"><span class="nm">i.</span><p>"He will spill (the blood) and cover" - the blood must be fit to be covered immediately after Shechitah;</p></div>
<div class="indent3"><span class="nm">ii.</span><p>This excludes Kodshei Bedek ha'Bayis, which need not be covered until after redemption.</p></div>
<div class="indent3"><span class="nm">iii.</span><p>This suggests another answer to Question 4:b (83b).</p></div>
<div class="indent1"><span class="nm">(b)</span><p><span class="cl">Answer #2:</span> The Mishnah exempts also Korbanos from Kisuy, since Kisuy cannot be done until the blood is scraped off the Mizbe'ach. ("He will spill and cover" excludes this.)</p></div>
<div class="indent1"><span class="nm">(c)</span><p><span class="cl">Answer #3 (Mar bar Rav Ashi):</span> The Mishnah exempts also Korbanos from Kisuy. "Chayah Oh Ohf" teaches that Kisuy applies to birds that are like Chayos, i.e. they are not Korbanos.</p></div>
<div class="indent2"><span class="nm">1.</span><p><span class="cl">Suggestion:</span> We should say that the verse discusses species of birds that are like Chayos, i.e. they are invalid for Kodshim;</p></div>
<div class="indent3"><span class="nm">i.</span><p>This would exclude Torim and doves.</p></div>
<div class="indent2"><span class="nm">2.</span><p><span class="cl">Rejection:</span> The verse equates Chayos and birds. Just like Kisuy applies to all (Kosher) species of Chayos, also regarding birds.</p></div>
<div class="subject"><span class="nm">2)</span><p>TO WHICH ANIMALS THE MITZVAH APPLIES</p></div>
<div class="indent1"><span class="nm">(a)</span><p><span class="cl">Question (Yakov Mina'ah):</span> The Torah gives Simanim of Kosher Behemos. They apply also to Chayos;</p></div>
<div class="indent2"><span class="nm">1.</span><p>We should say that the Torah commands to cover the blood of Chayos, and this applies also to Behemos!</p></div>
<div class="indent1"><span class="nm">(b)</span><p><span class="cl">Answer (Rava):</span> "On the ground you will spill it (Dam of blemished Korbanos, which are Behemos) like water" - just like water need not be covered, also Dam Behemah.</p></div>
<div class="indent1"><span class="nm">(c)</span><p><span class="cl">Question:</span> If blood of blemished Korbanos is equated to water, it should be valid for a Mikveh!</p></div>
<div class="indent1"><span class="nm">(d)</span><p><span class="cl">Answer:</span> "Ach Mayan u'Vor Mikveh Mayim Yihyeh Tahor" - only these (springs and pits of water) are valid Mikva'os, but nothing else.</p></div>
<div class="indent1"><span class="nm">(e)</span><p><span class="cl">Question:</span> The verse should exclude other liquids, which are not called water, but not Dam!</p></div>
<div class="indent1"><span class="nm">(f)</span><p><span class="cl">Answer:</span> There are two exclusions in the verse. It is as if it says 'Mayan Mayim u'Vor Mayim'.</p></div>
<div class="indent1"><span class="nm">(g)</span><p><span class="cl">Question:</span> We should exclude two cases of other liquids, flowing or collected, but not blood, which is called water!</p></div>
<div class="indent1"><span class="nm">(h)</span><p><span class="cl">Answer:</span> There are three exclusions in the verse. It is as if it says 'Mayan Mayim u'Vor Mayim Mikveh Mayim.'</p></div>
<div class="indent1"><span class="nm">(i)</span><p><span class="cl">(Beraisa) Suggestion:</span> Perhaps "Asher Yatzud" teaches that if it was already trapped (e.g. domestic geese and chickens), the Mitzvah does not apply!</p></div>
<div class="indent1"><span class="nm">(j)</span><p><span class="cl">Rejection:</span> "Tzeid" includes all cases.</p></div>
<div class="indent1"><span class="nm">(k)</span><p><span class="cl">Question:</span> If so, why did the Torah say "Asher Yatzud"?</p></div>
<div class="indent1"><span class="nm">(l)</span><p><span class="cl">Answer:</span> This teaches proper conduct, that one should not eat meat regularly, only on occasion (like when one happens to trap an animal).</p></div>
<div class="subject"><span class="nm">3)</span><p>BEING CAREFUL WITH YOUR MONEY</p></div>
<div class="indent1"><span class="nm">(a)</span><p><span class="cl">(Beraisa):</span> "When Hash-m will expand your borders (... and you will lust to eat meat)" teaches proper behavior, that one should eat meat only when he has a craving for it.</p></div>
<div class="indent1"><span class="nm">(b)</span><p><span class="cl">Suggestion:</span> Perhaps he may buy meat to eat!</p></div>
<div class="indent1"><span class="nm">(c)</span><p><span class="cl">Rejection:</span> "You will slaughter from your cattle and flock".</p></div>
<div class="indent1"><span class="nm">(d)</span><p><span class="cl">Suggestion:</span> Perhaps he may slaughter all his animals!</p></div>
<div class="indent1"><span class="nm">(e)</span><p><span class="cl">Rejection:</span> It says "from your cattle and from your flock", but not all of them.</p></div>
<div class="indent2"><span class="nm">1.</span><p><span class="cl">(R. Eliezer ben Azaryah):</span> If one has one Maneh (100 Zuz, which is less than an average annual income. One who has less than two Manos is considered poor), he should buy one Litra of vegetables. If he has 10 Manos, he should buy fish. If he has 50 Manos, he should buy meat. If he has 100 Manos, he should have meat every day.</p></div>
<div class="indent2"><span class="nm">2.</span><p><span class="cl">Question:</span> How often should people with 10 (and 50) Manos eat fish (and meat)?</p></div>
<div class="indent2"><span class="nm">3.</span><p><span class="cl">Answer:</span> They should eat them only on Shabbos.</p></div>
<div class="indent2"><span class="nm">4.</span><p><span class="cl">(Rav):</span> We should follow R. Eliezer ben Azaryah's teaching.</p></div>
<div class="indent2"><span class="nm">5.</span><p><span class="cl">(R. Yochanan):</span> Rav was healthy. He could conduct like R. Eliezer ben Azaryah. We are not healthy. One who has money should spend it on food.</p></div>
<div class="indent2"><span class="nm">6.</span><p><span class="cl">(Rav Nachman):</span> We are so weak that we should borrow money to buy food.</p></div>
<div class="indent1"><span class="nm">(f)</span><p>"Sheep for your clothing" teaches that one should clothe himself from their wool;</p></div>
<div class="indent1"><span class="nm">(g)</span><p>"The price of a field goats" teaches that one should sell his field, and use the money to buy goats;</p></div>
<div class="indent2"><span class="nm">1.</span><p>they give milk and clothing.)"It is enough (for your sustenance), the milk of goats" - you should not slaughter them.</p></div>
<div class="indent1"><span class="nm">(h)</span><p>"For your bread, for the bread of your household" teaches that your bread comes before that of your household;</p></div>
<div class="indent1"><span class="nm">(i)</span><p><span class="cl">(Mar Zutra brei d'Rav Nachman):</span> "And life for your youths" - do not accustom your children to meat and wine (rather, to simple foods).</p></div>
<div class="indent1"><span class="nm">(j)</span><p><span class="cl">(R. Yochanan):</span> To get rich, one should raise small animals.</p></div>
<div class="bbbline">84b----------------------------------------84b</p></div>
<div class="indent2"><span class="nm">1.</span><p><span class="cl">(Rav Chisda):</span> He learns from "Ashteros Tzonecha" - they make their owners Ashir (wealthy).</p></div>
<div class="indent1"><span class="nm">(k)</span><p><span class="cl">(R. Yochanan):</span> Lukewarm water is more hazardous than water on which witchcraft has been used.</p></div>
<div class="indent2"><span class="nm">1.</span><p>This is only if the warm water was in a metal Kli (not earthenware), without spices, and was never boiled;</p></div>
<div class="indent2"><span class="nm">2.</span><p>If any of these conditions is not met, the water is fine.</p></div>
<div class="indent1"><span class="nm">(l)</span><p><span class="cl">(R. Yochanan):</span> The following cause one to lose his money - wearing linen garments, using glass Kelim, and not supervising one's workers.</p></div>
<div class="indent2"><span class="nm">1.</span><p>He refers to Roman linen and white glass, which are very expensive;</p></div>
<div class="indent2"><span class="nm">2.</span><p>He refers to workers who plow with cattle. Their negligence causes great losses.</p></div>
<div class="indent1"><span class="nm">(m)</span><p><span class="cl">(Rav Avira):</span> "Good is a gracious man who lends. He finances his matters properly" - one should eat food less than his income dictates;</p></div>
<div class="indent2"><span class="nm">1.</span><p>He should clothe himself according to his income;</p></div>
<div class="indent2"><span class="nm">2.</span><p>He should honor his wife and children more than his income dictates, for they depend on him, and he depends on Hash-m.</p></div>
<div class="subject"><span class="nm">4)</span><p>KISUY HA'DAM ON SHABBOS OR YOM TOV</p></div>
<div class="indent1"><span class="nm">(a)</span><p><span class="cl">(Rav Eina):</span> If one slaughters (a Chayah or bird) for a Choleh (dangerously sick person) on Shabbos, he must cover the blood.</p></div>
<div class="indent1"><span class="nm">(b)</span><p><span class="cl">Question (Rabah - Beraisa - R. Yosi):</span> We do not slaughter a Koy on Yom Tov. If it was slaughtered, a Kal va'Chomer teaches that we do not do Kisuy;</p></div>
<div class="indent2"><span class="nm">1.</span><p>Bris Milah overrides Shabbos if it is surely the eighth day. If it is a Safek, it does not override even Yom Tov;</p></div>
<div class="indent2"><span class="nm">2.</span><p>Kisuy does not override Shabbos, even for a definite Chayah or bird. All the more so, it does not override Yom Tov for a Safek Chayah!</p></div>
<div class="indent2"><span class="nm">3.</span><p><span class="cl">Objection #1 (Chachamim):</span> Teki'as (sounding the) Shofar (on Rosh Hashanah) in the Gevulim (outside the Mikdash, or Yerushalayim, or the city where the Sanhedrin resides) disproves this. We do not blow on Shabbos even for a definite Mitzvah, but we blow on Yom Tov for a Safek (this will be explained)!</p></div>
<div class="indent2"><span class="nm">4.</span><p><span class="cl">Objection #2 (R. Elazar Hakapar Beribi):</span> Kisuy applies even at times when Milah does not, e.g. the night of Yom Tov, so one cannot learn from Milah that Kisuy does not override Yom Tov for a Safek!</p></div>
<div class="indent3"><span class="nm">i.</span><p><span class="cl">R. Aba:</span> R. Chiya said that he (i.e. anyone) cannot challenge R. Yosi's Kal va'Chomer. R. Elazar Hakapar challenged it! (R. Chiya holds that it is not a proper challenge.)</p></div>
<div class="indent2"><span class="nm">5.</span><p><span class="cl">(Summation of question (b)):</span> It says that Kisuy does not override Shabbos, even for a definite Chayah or bird.</p></div>
<div class="indent2"><span class="nm">6.</span><p><span class="cl">Suggestion:</span> The case is, the Shechitah was for a Choleh.</p></div>
<div class="indent1"><span class="nm">(c)</span><p><span class="cl">Answer:</span> Perhaps the Shechitah was for a healthy person. Since it was forbidden to slaughter, Kisuy is not done.</p></div>
<div class="indent1"><span class="nm">(d)</span><p><span class="cl">Rejection:</span> No, the Shechitah is like Milah (from which R. Yosi learns), which was permitted. (Rav Eina is refuted.)</p></div>
