<p class="bas subject"><span class="nm">1)</span>MATERIALS USED TO WRITE A <i>MEGILAH</i></p>
<p class="bas indent1"><span class="nm">(a)</span>'Diftera' is a hide that has been salted and soaked, but not treated with gallnuts (it is invalid).</p>
<p class="bas indent1"><span class="nm">(b)</span>'Neyar' is herbs that were glued together.</p>
<p class="bas indent1"><span class="nm">(c)</span><span class="cl">(Mishnah):</span> It must be written Ashuris.</p>
<p class="bas indent2"><span class="nm">1.</span>This is learned from "Ki'Chsavam".</p>
<p class="bas indent1"><span class="nm">(d)</span><span class="cl">(Mishnah):</span> It must be written in a Sefer, in ink.</p>
<p class="bas indent2"><span class="nm">1.</span>We learn from a Gezerah Shavah "Kesivah-Kesivah" from "Va'Ani Kosev Al ha'Sefer bi'Dyo."</p>
<p class="bas subject"><span class="nm">2)</span>SOMEONE IN A DIFFERENT PLACE ON PURIM</p>
<p class="bas indent1"><span class="nm">(a)</span><span class="cl">(Mishnah):</span> If a Ben Ir (resident of an open city) went to a Kerach (walled city), or vice-versa:</p>
<p class="bas indent2"><span class="nm">1.</span>If he will return to his place, he reads like in his place. If not, he reads where he is.</p>
<p class="bas indent1"><span class="nm">(b)</span><span class="cl">Question:</span> How much of the Megilah must one read to be Yotzei?</p>
<p class="bas indent1"><span class="nm">(c)</span><span class="cl">Answer #1 (R. Meir):</span> He must read the entire Megilah.</p>
<p class="bas indent1"><span class="nm">(d)</span><span class="cl">Answer #2 (R. Yehudah):</span> He must read from "Ish Yehudi."</p>
<p class="bas indent1"><span class="nm">(e)</span><span class="cl">Answer #3 (R. Yosi):</span> He must read from "After these matters."</p>
<p class="bas indent1"><span class="nm">(f)</span><span class="cl">(Gemara - Rava):</span> The Mishnah says that he (a Ben Kerach) reads like in his place if he will return, i.e. before dawn of the 14th. If not, he reads with them (where he is).</p>
<p class="bas indent2"><span class="nm">1.</span>We learn this from "Ha'Prazim ha'Yoshvim b'Arei ha'Prazos". The repetition teaches that one who dwells in an Ir for one day is called a Ben Ir.</p>
<p class="bas indent2"><span class="nm">2.</span>Logic dictates that similarly, a Ben Kerach for one day is called a Ben Kerach. (Therefore, if a Ben Ir will not return before dawn of the 15th, he waits to read with the Kerach on the 15th).</p>
<p class="bas indent1"><span class="nm">(g)</span><span class="cl">(Rava):</span> If a villager went to a city he reads with them, whether or not he will return.</p>
<p class="bas indent1"><span class="nm">(h)</span><span class="cl">Question:</span> What is the reason?</p>
<p class="bas indent1"><span class="nm">(i)</span><span class="cl">Answer:</span> Really, he should read like a Ben Ir. Chachamim were lenient regarding villagers, because they supply food and water to the cities. The leniency does not apply if he is in the city on the 14th.</p>
<p class="bas indent1"><span class="nm">(j)</span><span class="cl">Question (Abaye - Beraisa):</span> If a Ben Kerach went to an Ir, in any case reads like his place.</p>
<p class="bas indent2"><span class="nm">1.</span><span class="cl">Objection:</span> The Mishnah says that it depends on whether or not he will return!</p>
<p class="bas indent2"><span class="nm">2.</span><span class="cl">Correction:</span> Rather, the Beraisa should say 'if a villager went to an Ir (in any case he reads like his place. This is unlike Rava!)</p>
<p class="bas indent1"><span class="nm">(k)</span><span class="cl">Answer:</span> The Beraisa must be corrected in any case. We can correct it to say that he reads with them.</p>
<p class="bas subject"><span class="nm">3)</span>HOW MUCH OF THE <i>MEGILAH</i> MUST BE READ</p>
<p class="bas indent1"><span class="nm">(a)</span><span class="cl">(Mishnah) Question:</span> How much of the Megilah must one read to be Yotzei?</p>
<p class="bas indent1"><span class="nm">(b)</span><span class="cl">(Beraisa -R. Shimon):</span> One must read from "On that night."</p>
<p class="bas indent1"><span class="nm">(c)</span><span class="cl">(R. Yochanan):</span> R. Shimon and the Tana'im of the Mishnah all learn from "Va'Tichtov... Kol Tokef":</p>
<p class="bas indent2"><span class="nm">1.</span>R. Meir requires reading the entire Megilah, i.e. the Tokef (might) of Achashverosh.</p>
<p class="bas indent2"><span class="nm">2.</span>R. Yehudah requires from "Ish Yehudi", i.e. the Tokef of Mordechai.</p>
<p class="bas indent2"><span class="nm">3.</span>R. Yosi requires from "After these matters", i.e. the Tokef of Haman.</p>
<p class="bas indent2"><span class="nm">4.</span>R. Shimon requires from "On that night", i.e. the Tokef of the miracle.</p>
<p class="bas indent1"><span class="nm">(d)</span><span class="cl">(Rav Huna):</span> They all learn from "Why did they act as they did? Because they saw this; and this is what happened to them";</p>
<p class="bas indent2"><span class="nm">1.</span>The one who requires reading the entire Megilah explains 'Why did Achashverosh use the Kelim of the Beis ha'Mikdash? Because he saw that Yisrael were not redeemed after 70 years. This is what happened to him, i.e. he killed Vashti.'</p>
<p class="bas indent2"><span class="nm">2.</span>The one who requires reading from "Ish Yehudi" explains 'Why did Mordechai provoke Haman? Because Haman made himself an idolatry. This is what happened, i.e. a miracle was done.</p>
<p class="bas indent2"><span class="nm">3.</span>The one who requires from "After these things" explains 'Why did Haman envy all the Yisraelim? Because Mordechai wouldn't bow to him. This is what happened to him, i.e. he and his sons were hung.</p>
<p class="bas indent2"><span class="nm">4.</span>The one who requires from "On that night" explains 'Why did Achashverosh ask to bring the chronicles? Because Esther invited Haman with him (like Rava, 15b). This is what happened, i.e. a miracle.</p>
<p class="bas indent1"><span class="nm">(e)</span><span class="cl">(R. Chelbo):</span> The Halachah follows the opinion that requires reading the entire Megilah. Even the opinion that requires only from "Ish Yehudi" requires that he read from a complete Megilah.</p>
<p class="bas indent1"><span class="nm">(f)</span><span class="cl">(R. Chelbo):</span> The Megilah is called "Sefer" and it is called "Igeres" (a letter);</p>
<p class="bas indent2"><span class="nm">1.</span>"Sefer" disqualifies a Megilah sewn with flax (such a Sefer Torah is Pasul);</p>
<p class="bas indent2"><span class="nm">2.</span>' Igeres' teaches that three stitches of a sinew suffice.</p>
<p class="bas indent2"><span class="nm">3.</span><span class="cl">(Rav Nachman):</span> The stitches must be evenly spaced.</p>
<p class="bas indent1"><span class="nm">(g)</span><span class="cl">(Rav Yehudah):</span> One who reads a Megilah written amidst Kesuvim is not Yotzei.</p>
<p class="bas indent1"><span class="nm">(h)</span><span class="cl">(Rava):</span> If the Megilah was larger or smaller than the other parchments, there is no problem.</p>
<p class="bas indent2"><span class="nm">1.</span>Rav Yehudah once rebuked Levi bar Shmuel for reading a Megilah written amidst Kesuvim.</p>
<p class="bas bbbline">19b----------------------------------------19b</p>
<p class="bas indent1"><span class="nm">(i)</span><span class="cl">(R. Chiya bar Aba):</span> One who reads a Megilah written amidst Kesuvim is not Yotzei.</p>
<p class="bas indent2"><span class="nm">1.</span>He hit on his head (to show that he retracts), and said 'this only applies b'Tzibur (but an individual is Yotzei).'</p>
<p class="bas indent1"><span class="nm">(j)</span><span class="cl">(R. Chiya bar Aba):</span> We have a tradition from Sinai that one should not entirely sew together the parchments of a Sefer Torah (he should leave some of the top and bottom unsewn);</p>
<p class="bas indent2"><span class="nm">1.</span>He hit on his head (for it is not really from Sinai). This is only so it should not tear.</p>
<p class="bas indent1"><span class="nm">(k)</span><span class="cl">(R. Chiya bar Aba):</span> Had there been a crack in the cave where Moshe and Eliyahu were when Hash-m's glory passed over, they could not have survived the light - "Man cannot see Me and live."</p>
<p class="bas indent1"><span class="nm">(l)</span><span class="cl">(R. Chiya bar Aba):</span> "... And on them (the Luchos) like everything that Hash-m spoke with you in the mountain" - on Sinai Hash-m showed to Moshe all the Dikdukim (e.g. Ribuyim and Mi'utim) in the Torah and in Divrei Chachamim, and what Chachamim will add, i.e. Keri'as ha'Megilah.</p>
<p class="bas subject"><span class="nm">4)</span>WHO MAY READ THE <i>MEGILAH</i></p>
<p class="bas indent1"><span class="nm">(a)</span><span class="cl">(Mishnah):</span> All may read the Megilah, except for a child, lunatic or Cheresh (deaf person);</p>
<p class="bas indent1"><span class="nm">(b)</span>R. Yehudah permits a child.</p>
<p class="bas indent1"><span class="nm">(c)</span><span class="cl">(Gemara) Question:</span> Who is the Tana of our Mishnah, who says that one who hears from a Cheresh is not Yotzei?</p>
<p class="bas indent1"><span class="nm">(d)</span><span class="cl">Answer (Rav Masnah):</span> It is R. Yosi:</p>
<p class="bas indent2"><span class="nm">1.</span><span class="cl">(Mishnah):</span> One who reads Keri'as Shema inaudibly to his own ears is Yotzei;</p>
<p class="bas indent2"><span class="nm">2.</span>R. Yosi says that he was not Yotzei.</p>
<p class="bas indent1"><span class="nm">(e)</span><span class="cl">Suggestion:</span> Perhaps our Mishnah is R. Yehudah (the first Tana), and the Cheresh may not read l'Chatchilah, but b'Di'eved one is Yotzei!</p>
<p class="bas indent1"><span class="nm">(f)</span><span class="cl">Rejection #1:</span> A Cheresh is taught together with a lunatic and child. This shows that their law is the same, i.e. even b'Di'eved one is not Yotzei.</p>
<p class="bas indent1"><span class="nm">(g)</span><span class="cl">Rebuttal (of rejection):</span> Perhaps their laws are not the same!</p>
<p class="bas indent1"><span class="nm">(h)</span><span class="cl">Rejection #2:</span> Since R. Yehudah taught the Seifa, he did not teach the Reisha.</p>
<p class="bas indent1"><span class="nm">(i)</span><span class="cl">Question:</span> Perhaps the entire Mishnah is R. Yehudah!</p>
<p class="bas indent1"><span class="nm">(j)</span><span class="cl">Answer:</span> This cannot be. The Reisha says that a child may not read, but the end permits!</p>
<p class="bas indent1"><span class="nm">(k)</span><span class="cl">Rebuttal:</span> Perhaps the Reisha discusses a child below the age of Chinuch (training in Mitzvos), and the Seifa discusses a child that reached Chinuch!</p>
<p class="bas indent1"><span class="nm">(l)</span><span class="cl">Rejection #3:</span> You cannot say that R. Yehudah says that b'Di'eved one is Yotzei if he read inaudibly!</p>
<p class="bas indent2"><span class="nm">1.</span><span class="cl">(Beraisa #1 - R. Yehudah brei d'R. Shimon ben Pazi):</span> A Cheresh who can speak but not hear may tithe l'Chatchilah (even though he cannot hear his own Berachah)!</p>
<p class="bas indent2"><span class="nm">2.</span>This is unlike R. Yosi, who says that even b'Di'eved one is not Yotzei. If R. Yehudah forbids l'Chatchilah, this is not like either Tana!</p>
<p class="bas indent1"><span class="nm">(m)</span><span class="cl">Counter-question:</span> You cannot say that R. Yehudah permits l'Chatchilah!</p>
<p class="bas indent2"><span class="nm">1.</span><span class="cl">(Beraisa #2):</span> One should not bless silently after a meal. If he did, he was Yotzei.</p>
<p class="bas indent2"><span class="nm">2.</span>This is unlike R. Yosi, who says that even b'Di'eved he is not Yotzei. If R. Yehudah permits l'Chatchilah, this is not like either Tana!</p>
