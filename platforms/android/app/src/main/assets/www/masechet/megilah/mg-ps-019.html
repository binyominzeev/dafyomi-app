<div class="subject"><span class="nm">1)</span><p>MATERIALS USED TO WRITE A MEGILAH</p></div>
<div class="indent1"><span class="nm">(a)</span><p>'Diftera' is a hide that has been salted and soaked, but not treated with gallnuts (it is invalid).</p></div>
<div class="indent1"><span class="nm">(b)</span><p>'Neyar' is herbs that were glued together.</p></div>
<div class="indent1"><span class="nm">(c)</span><p><span class="cl">(Mishnah):</span> It must be written Ashuris.</p></div>
<div class="indent2"><span class="nm">1.</span><p>This is learned from "Ki'Chsavam".</p></div>
<div class="indent1"><span class="nm">(d)</span><p><span class="cl">(Mishnah):</span> It must be written in a Sefer, in ink.</p></div>
<div class="indent2"><span class="nm">1.</span><p>We learn from a Gezerah Shavah "Kesivah-Kesivah" from "Va'Ani Kosev Al ha'Sefer bi'Dyo."</p></div>
<div class="subject"><span class="nm">2)</span><p>SOMEONE IN A DIFFERENT PLACE ON PURIM</p></div>
<div class="indent1"><span class="nm">(a)</span><p><span class="cl">(Mishnah):</span> If a Ben Ir (resident of an open city) went to a Kerach (walled city), or vice-versa:</p></div>
<div class="indent2"><span class="nm">1.</span><p>If he will return to his place, he reads like in his place. If not, he reads where he is.</p></div>
<div class="indent1"><span class="nm">(b)</span><p><span class="cl">Question:</span> How much of the Megilah must one read to be Yotzei?</p></div>
<div class="indent1"><span class="nm">(c)</span><p><span class="cl">Answer #1 (R. Meir):</span> He must read the entire Megilah.</p></div>
<div class="indent1"><span class="nm">(d)</span><p><span class="cl">Answer #2 (R. Yehudah):</span> He must read from "Ish Yehudi."</p></div>
<div class="indent1"><span class="nm">(e)</span><p><span class="cl">Answer #3 (R. Yosi):</span> He must read from "After these matters."</p></div>
<div class="indent1"><span class="nm">(f)</span><p><span class="cl">(Gemara - Rava):</span> The Mishnah says that he (a Ben Kerach) reads like in his place if he will return, i.e. before dawn of the 14th. If not, he reads with them (where he is).</p></div>
<div class="indent2"><span class="nm">1.</span><p>We learn this from "Ha'Prazim ha'Yoshvim b'Arei ha'Prazos". The repetition teaches that one who dwells in an Ir for one day is called a Ben Ir.</p></div>
<div class="indent2"><span class="nm">2.</span><p>Logic dictates that similarly, a Ben Kerach for one day is called a Ben Kerach. (Therefore, if a Ben Ir will not return before dawn of the 15th, he waits to read with the Kerach on the 15th).</p></div>
<div class="indent1"><span class="nm">(g)</span><p><span class="cl">(Rava):</span> If a villager went to a city he reads with them, whether or not he will return.</p></div>
<div class="indent1"><span class="nm">(h)</span><p><span class="cl">Question:</span> What is the reason?</p></div>
<div class="indent1"><span class="nm">(i)</span><p><span class="cl">Answer:</span> Really, he should read like a Ben Ir. Chachamim were lenient regarding villagers, because they supply food and water to the cities. The leniency does not apply if he is in the city on the 14th.</p></div>
<div class="indent1"><span class="nm">(j)</span><p><span class="cl">Question (Abaye - Beraisa):</span> If a Ben Kerach went to an Ir, in any case reads like his place.</p></div>
<div class="indent2"><span class="nm">1.</span><p><span class="cl">Objection:</span> The Mishnah says that it depends on whether or not he will return!</p></div>
<div class="indent2"><span class="nm">2.</span><p><span class="cl">Correction:</span> Rather, the Beraisa should say 'if a villager went to an Ir (in any case he reads like his place. This is unlike Rava!)</p></div>
<div class="indent1"><span class="nm">(k)</span><p><span class="cl">Answer:</span> The Beraisa must be corrected in any case. We can correct it to say that he reads with them.</p></div>
<div class="subject"><span class="nm">3)</span><p>HOW MUCH OF THE MEGILAH MUST BE READ</p></div>
<div class="indent1"><span class="nm">(a)</span><p><span class="cl">(Mishnah) Question:</span> How much of the Megilah must one read to be Yotzei?</p></div>
<div class="indent1"><span class="nm">(b)</span><p><span class="cl">(Beraisa -R. Shimon):</span> One must read from "On that night."</p></div>
<div class="indent1"><span class="nm">(c)</span><p><span class="cl">(R. Yochanan):</span> R. Shimon and the Tana'im of the Mishnah all learn from "Va'Tichtov... Kol Tokef":</p></div>
<div class="indent2"><span class="nm">1.</span><p>R. Meir requires reading the entire Megilah, i.e. the Tokef (might) of Achashverosh.</p></div>
<div class="indent2"><span class="nm">2.</span><p>R. Yehudah requires from "Ish Yehudi", i.e. the Tokef of Mordechai.</p></div>
<div class="indent2"><span class="nm">3.</span><p>R. Yosi requires from "After these matters", i.e. the Tokef of Haman.</p></div>
<div class="indent2"><span class="nm">4.</span><p>R. Shimon requires from "On that night", i.e. the Tokef of the miracle.</p></div>
<div class="indent1"><span class="nm">(d)</span><p><span class="cl">(Rav Huna):</span> They all learn from "Why did they act as they did? Because they saw this; and this is what happened to them";</p></div>
<div class="indent2"><span class="nm">1.</span><p>The one who requires reading the entire Megilah explains 'Why did Achashverosh use the Kelim of the Beis ha'Mikdash? Because he saw that Yisrael were not redeemed after 70 years. This is what happened to him, i.e. he killed Vashti.'</p></div>
<div class="indent2"><span class="nm">2.</span><p>The one who requires reading from "Ish Yehudi" explains 'Why did Mordechai provoke Haman? Because Haman made himself an idolatry. This is what happened, i.e. a miracle was done.</p></div>
<div class="indent2"><span class="nm">3.</span><p>The one who requires from "After these things" explains 'Why did Haman envy all the Yisraelim? Because Mordechai wouldn't bow to him. This is what happened to him, i.e. he and his sons were hung.</p></div>
<div class="indent2"><span class="nm">4.</span><p>The one who requires from "On that night" explains 'Why did Achashverosh ask to bring the chronicles? Because Esther invited Haman with him (like Rava, 15b). This is what happened, i.e. a miracle.</p></div>
<div class="indent1"><span class="nm">(e)</span><p><span class="cl">(R. Chelbo):</span> The Halachah follows the opinion that requires reading the entire Megilah. Even the opinion that requires only from "Ish Yehudi" requires that he read from a complete Megilah.</p></div>
<div class="indent1"><span class="nm">(f)</span><p><span class="cl">(R. Chelbo):</span> The Megilah is called "Sefer" and it is called "Igeres" (a letter);</p></div>
<div class="indent2"><span class="nm">1.</span><p>"Sefer" disqualifies a Megilah sewn with flax (such a Sefer Torah is Pasul);</p></div>
<div class="indent2"><span class="nm">2.</span><p>' Igeres' teaches that three stitches of a sinew suffice.</p></div>
<div class="indent2"><span class="nm">3.</span><p><span class="cl">(Rav Nachman):</span> The stitches must be evenly spaced.</p></div>
<div class="indent1"><span class="nm">(g)</span><p><span class="cl">(Rav Yehudah):</span> One who reads a Megilah written amidst Kesuvim is not Yotzei.</p></div>
<div class="indent1"><span class="nm">(h)</span><p><span class="cl">(Rava):</span> If the Megilah was larger or smaller than the other parchments, there is no problem.</p></div>
<div class="indent2"><span class="nm">1.</span><p>Rav Yehudah once rebuked Levi bar Shmuel for reading a Megilah written amidst Kesuvim.</p></div>
<div class="bbbline">19b----------------------------------------19b</p></div>
<div class="indent1"><span class="nm">(i)</span><p><span class="cl">(R. Chiya bar Aba):</span> One who reads a Megilah written amidst Kesuvim is not Yotzei.</p></div>
<div class="indent2"><span class="nm">1.</span><p>He hit on his head (to show that he retracts), and said 'this only applies b'Tzibur (but an individual is Yotzei).'</p></div>
<div class="indent1"><span class="nm">(j)</span><p><span class="cl">(R. Chiya bar Aba):</span> We have a tradition from Sinai that one should not entirely sew together the parchments of a Sefer Torah (he should leave some of the top and bottom unsewn);</p></div>
<div class="indent2"><span class="nm">1.</span><p>He hit on his head (for it is not really from Sinai). This is only so it should not tear.</p></div>
<div class="indent1"><span class="nm">(k)</span><p><span class="cl">(R. Chiya bar Aba):</span> Had there been a crack in the cave where Moshe and Eliyahu were when Hash-m's glory passed over, they could not have survived the light - "Man cannot see Me and live."</p></div>
<div class="indent1"><span class="nm">(l)</span><p><span class="cl">(R. Chiya bar Aba):</span> "... And on them (the Luchos) like everything that Hash-m spoke with you in the mountain" - on Sinai Hash-m showed to Moshe all the Dikdukim (e.g. Ribuyim and Mi'utim) in the Torah and in Divrei Chachamim, and what Chachamim will add, i.e. Keri'as ha'Megilah.</p></div>
<div class="subject"><span class="nm">4)</span><p>WHO MAY READ THE MEGILAH</p></div>
<div class="indent1"><span class="nm">(a)</span><p><span class="cl">(Mishnah):</span> All may read the Megilah, except for a child, lunatic or Cheresh (deaf person);</p></div>
<div class="indent1"><span class="nm">(b)</span><p>R. Yehudah permits a child.</p></div>
<div class="indent1"><span class="nm">(c)</span><p><span class="cl">(Gemara) Question:</span> Who is the Tana of our Mishnah, who says that one who hears from a Cheresh is not Yotzei?</p></div>
<div class="indent1"><span class="nm">(d)</span><p><span class="cl">Answer (Rav Masnah):</span> It is R. Yosi:</p></div>
<div class="indent2"><span class="nm">1.</span><p><span class="cl">(Mishnah):</span> One who reads Keri'as Shema inaudibly to his own ears is Yotzei;</p></div>
<div class="indent2"><span class="nm">2.</span><p>R. Yosi says that he was not Yotzei.</p></div>
<div class="indent1"><span class="nm">(e)</span><p><span class="cl">Suggestion:</span> Perhaps our Mishnah is R. Yehudah (the first Tana), and the Cheresh may not read l'Chatchilah, but b'Di'eved one is Yotzei!</p></div>
<div class="indent1"><span class="nm">(f)</span><p><span class="cl">Rejection #1:</span> A Cheresh is taught together with a lunatic and child. This shows that their law is the same, i.e. even b'Di'eved one is not Yotzei.</p></div>
<div class="indent1"><span class="nm">(g)</span><p><span class="cl">Rebuttal (of rejection):</span> Perhaps their laws are not the same!</p></div>
<div class="indent1"><span class="nm">(h)</span><p><span class="cl">Rejection #2:</span> Since R. Yehudah taught the Seifa, he did not teach the Reisha.</p></div>
<div class="indent1"><span class="nm">(i)</span><p><span class="cl">Question:</span> Perhaps the entire Mishnah is R. Yehudah!</p></div>
<div class="indent1"><span class="nm">(j)</span><p><span class="cl">Answer:</span> This cannot be. The Reisha says that a child may not read, but the end permits!</p></div>
<div class="indent1"><span class="nm">(k)</span><p><span class="cl">Rebuttal:</span> Perhaps the Reisha discusses a child below the age of Chinuch (training in Mitzvos), and the Seifa discusses a child that reached Chinuch!</p></div>
<div class="indent1"><span class="nm">(l)</span><p><span class="cl">Rejection #3:</span> You cannot say that R. Yehudah says that b'Di'eved one is Yotzei if he read inaudibly!</p></div>
<div class="indent2"><span class="nm">1.</span><p><span class="cl">(Beraisa #1 - R. Yehudah brei d'R. Shimon ben Pazi):</span> A Cheresh who can speak but not hear may tithe l'Chatchilah (even though he cannot hear his own Berachah)!</p></div>
<div class="indent2"><span class="nm">2.</span><p>This is unlike R. Yosi, who says that even b'Di'eved one is not Yotzei. If R. Yehudah forbids l'Chatchilah, this is not like either Tana!</p></div>
<div class="indent1"><span class="nm">(m)</span><p><span class="cl">Counter-question:</span> You cannot say that R. Yehudah permits l'Chatchilah!</p></div>
<div class="indent2"><span class="nm">1.</span><p><span class="cl">(Beraisa #2):</span> One should not bless silently after a meal. If he did, he was Yotzei.</p></div>
<div class="indent2"><span class="nm">2.</span><p>This is unlike R. Yosi, who says that even b'Di'eved he is not Yotzei. If R. Yehudah permits l'Chatchilah, this is not like either Tana!</p></div>
