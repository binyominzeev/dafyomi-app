<p class="bas subject"><span class="nm">1)</span>WHY CHEESE OF NOCHRIM IS FORBIDDEN</p>
<p class="bas indent1"><span class="nm">(a)</span><span class="cl">(Rava):</span> Both of these can be derived from our Mishnah;</p>
<p class="bas indent2"><span class="nm">1.</span><span class="cl">(Mishnah):</span> R. Yehoshua said 'because (Nochrim) curdle cheese with (Peresh of) stomachs of Neveilos', and R. Yishmael asked 'even Peresh of an Olah is permitted!'</p>
<p class="bas indent3"><span class="nm">i.</span><span class="cl">Inference:</span> Even if one may not benefit from an animal, its Peresh is permitted.</p>
<p class="bas indent2"><span class="nm">2.</span><span class="cl">(Mishnah):</span> R. Yehoshua said 'because they curdle it in stomachs of calves offered to idolatry', and R. Yishmael said 'if so, it should be forbidden to benefit from it';</p>
<p class="bas indent3"><span class="nm">i.</span><span class="cl">Inference:</span> Peresh of calves offered to idolatry is forbidden.</p>
<p class="bas indent1"><span class="nm">(b)</span><span class="cl">Question:</span> Why didn't R. Yishmael ask that it should be permitted because the forbidden ingredient (Peresh) is not intact!</p>
<p class="bas indent2"><span class="nm">1.</span>Chachamim permit benefit from Muryas of Nochrim, because (even if it contains wine,) the forbidden ingredient is not intact</p>
<p class="bas indent1"><span class="nm">(c)</span><span class="cl">Answer:</span> Since the Peresh curdles the milk, it is considered as if it is intact.</p>
<p class="bas indent1"><span class="nm">(d)</span><span class="cl">(Mishnah):</span> He diverted him to another matter...</p>
<p class="bas indent1"><span class="nm">(e)</span><span class="cl">Question:</span> What does it mean "Ki Tovim <i>Dodecha</i> mi'Yayin"?</p>
<p class="bas indent1"><span class="nm">(f)</span><span class="cl">Answer (Rav Dimi):</span> Yisrael says that laws of Hash-m's dear ones (Chachamim) are dearer to them than mid'Oraisa laws.</p>
<p class="bas indent1"><span class="nm">(g)</span><span class="cl">Question:</span> Why did he ask him about this verse?</p>
<p class="bas indent2"><span class="nm">1.</span><span class="cl">Answer (R. Shimon ben Pazi):</span> He intended for the beginning of the verse - "Yishakeni mi'Neshikos Pihu", i.e. R. Yishmael should Chashok (seal) his lips and not ask (why cheese of Nochrim is forbidden).</p>
<p class="bas indent2"><span class="nm">2.</span><span class="cl">Question:</span> Why shouldn't he ask?</p>
<p class="bas indent2"><span class="nm">3.</span><span class="cl">Answer (Ula):</span> It was a new decree. We do not reveal the reason (until one year).</p>
<p class="bas indent1"><span class="nm">(h)</span><span class="cl">Question:</span> What is the reason for the decree?</p>
<p class="bas indent1"><span class="nm">(i)</span><span class="cl">Answer #1 (R. Shimon ben Pazi):</span> Perhaps a snake drank from (the milk, and poisoned) it.</p>
<p class="bas indent2"><span class="nm">1.</span><span class="cl">Question:</span> Why didn't he tell him?</p>
<p class="bas indent2"><span class="nm">2.</span><span class="cl">Answer:</span> This was for Ula's reason;</p>
<p class="bas indent3"><span class="nm">i.</span><span class="cl">(Ula):</span> In Eretz Yisrael, they do not reveal the reason for a new decree for a year, lest someone disagree and not accept it.</p>
<p class="bas indent1"><span class="nm">(j)</span><span class="cl">Objection (R. Yirmeyah):</span> If so, dry or aged cheese should be permitted!</p>
<p class="bas indent2"><span class="nm">1.</span><span class="cl">(R. Chanina):</span> If something was exposed, and it dried, it is permitted. If it contained venom, it would not dry properly;</p>
<p class="bas indent2"><span class="nm">2.</span>If (wine or beer) was exposed, and it was aged, it is permitted. If it contained venom, it would not age properly.</p>
<p class="bas indent1"><span class="nm">(k)</span><span class="cl">Answer #2 (R. Chanina):</span> There are always drops of milk in cheese. (Rashi - even though milk of Tamei animals cannot be made into cheese, perhaps the drops are from Tamei animals. Tosfos - R. Yirmeyah answered his own objection. Perhaps there is venom in the drops.)</p>
<p class="bas indent1"><span class="nm">(l)</span><span class="cl">Answer #3 (or #2 - Shmuel):</span> They curdle the milk in the <i>skin of</i> stomachs of Neveilos.</p>
<p class="bas indent2"><span class="nm">1.</span><span class="cl">Question:</span> This implies that if they would use the contents of the stomach itself (i.e. the Peresh) of Neveilos, it would be permitted. Shmuel taught otherwise!</p>
<p class="bas indent2"><span class="nm">2.</span><span class="cl">Question (Mishnah):</span> A stomach of (an animal of) a Nochri or of a Neveilah is forbidden.</p>
<p class="bas indent3"><span class="nm">i.</span><span class="cl">Question:</span> (Why are these considered two things?) The animal of a Nochri is a Neveilah (even if he slaughtered it)!</p>
<p class="bas indent3"><span class="nm">ii.</span><span class="cl">Answer (Shmuel):</span> The Mishnah means, an animal slaughtered with a Nochri is a Neveilah, and its stomach is forbidden.</p>
<p class="bas bbbline">35b----------------------------------------35b</p>
<p class="bas indent2"><span class="nm">3.</span><span class="cl">Answer:</span> Shmuel explains both Mishnayos. That Mishnah was taught before R. Yehoshua retracted. Our Mishnah is after he retracted (due to R. Yishmael's proof from Peresh of an Olah).</p>
<p class="bas indent1"><span class="nm">(m)</span><span class="cl">Answer #4 (or #3 - Rav Malkiya):</span> They use lard of pigs to smooth the cheese.</p>
<p class="bas indent1"><span class="nm">(n)</span><span class="cl">Answer #5 (or #4 - Rav Chisda):</span> They use vinegar to curdle.</p>
<p class="bas indent1"><span class="nm">(o)</span><span class="cl">Answer #6 (or #5 - Rav Nachman bar Yitzchak):</span> They use sap of Orlah to curdle.</p>
<p class="bas indent2"><span class="nm">1.</span><span class="cl">Suggestion:</span> This is like R. Eliezer.</p>
<p class="bas indent3"><span class="nm">i.</span><span class="cl">(Mishnah - R. Eliezer):</span> If one uses sap of Orlah to curdle, it (the cheese) is forbidden, because sap is considered fruit.</p>
<p class="bas indent2"><span class="nm">2.</span><span class="cl">Rejection:</span> No, it is even like R. Yehoshua;</p>
<p class="bas indent3"><span class="nm">i.</span>R. Yehoshua argues only about sap of the wood. He admits that sap (i.e. secretions of) fruit are considered fruit.</p>
<p class="bas indent2"><span class="nm">3.</span><span class="cl">Support (Mishnah - R. Yehoshua):</span> If one uses sap of leaves or the roots (of Orlah) to curdle, it is permitted. If he uses sap of unripe figs, it is forbidden, for it is fruit.</p>
<p class="bas indent1"><span class="nm">(p)</span><span class="cl">Question:</span> According to Rav Chisda and Rav Nachman, it should be forbidden to benefit from cheese of Nochrim (because one may not benefit from the curdling agent)!</p>
<p class="bas indent1"><span class="nm">(q)</span>This is left difficult.</p>
<p class="bas indent1"><span class="nm">(r)</span><span class="cl">(Rav Nachman brei d'Rav Chisda):</span> "L'Rei'ach Shemanecha Tovim" - a Chacham is compared to a flask of fragrant oil;</p>
<p class="bas indent2"><span class="nm">1.</span>If the flask is open (the Chacham teaches others), it gives off a nice scent. If not, it does not.</p>
<p class="bas indent2"><span class="nm">2.</span>(If he teaches others,) hidden things are revealed to him. We read "Alamos Ahevucha" like 'Alumos' (hidden things).</p>
<p class="bas indent2"><span class="nm">3.</span>Also, the angel of death loves him. We read the verse like 'Al Maves Ahevucha';</p>
<p class="bas indent2"><span class="nm">4.</span>Also, he inherits this world and the world to come. We read it like 'Olamos.'</p>
<p class="bas subject"><span class="nm">2)</span>FORBIDDEN THINGS OF NOCHRIM</p>
<p class="bas indent1"><span class="nm">(a)</span><span class="cl">(Mishnah):</span> The following things of Nochrim are forbidden to eat, but one may benefit from them: milk that a Nochri milked without a Yisrael watching, their bread and oil;</p>
<p class="bas indent2"><span class="nm">1.</span>(Rebbi and his Beis Din permitted oil. Rashi deletes this from the text, for oil was permitted (after the Mishnah) by R. Yehudah <i>Nesi'ah</i>, the grandson of Rebbi.)</p>
<p class="bas indent2"><span class="nm">2.</span>Cooked foods and pickled foods in which wine or vinegar is often put;</p>
<p class="bas indent2"><span class="nm">3.</span>Diced Tiryas (a Kosher fish), brine (unless a certain fish called Kalbis swims in it), Chilek (fish that are late to grow fins and scales), a Koret (cut piece; Aruch - seed; Me'iri - stalk) of Chiltis (a spice), and Shalkundis salt (these will be explained later).</p>
<p class="bas indent1"><span class="nm">(b)</span><span class="cl">(Gemara) Question:</span> What is the concern regarding milk?</p>
<p class="bas indent2"><span class="nm">1.</span><span class="cl">Suggestion:</span> Perhaps he switched it with milk of a Tamei animal.</p>
<p class="bas indent2"><span class="nm">2.</span><span class="cl">Rejection:</span> (This would be obvious.) Milk of a Tahor animal is white, and milk of a Tamei animal is Yarok!</p>
<p class="bas indent2"><span class="nm">3.</span><span class="cl">Suggestion:</span> Perhaps he mixed in milk of a Tamei animal.</p>
<p class="bas indent2"><span class="nm">4.</span><span class="cl">Rejection:</span> We could test this by trying to curdle it!</p>
<p class="bas indent3"><span class="nm">i.</span>Milk of a Tahor animal curdles, but milk of a Tamei animal does not curdle.</p>
<p class="bas indent1"><span class="nm">(c)</span><span class="cl">Answer #1:</span> Indeed, one who wants to make cheese may buy milk from a Nochri. If it curdles, it is Tahor;</p>
<p class="bas indent2"><span class="nm">1.</span>The Mishnah forbids putting it in food (or drinking it).</p>
<p class="bas indent2"><span class="nm">2.</span><span class="cl">Question:</span> We can test it by trying to curdle some of it!</p>
<p class="bas indent2"><span class="nm">3.</span><span class="cl">Answer:</span> In curdling (even pure Tahor milk), some (liquid) whey remains, so we will not know if some Tamei milk was mixed in.</p>
<p class="bas indent1"><span class="nm">(d)</span><span class="cl">Answer #2:</span> Even one who wants to make cheese may not buy milk from a Nochri. Some whey remains between the cracks (after curdling). Perhaps this is from Tamei milk that was mixed in.</p>
<p class="bas indent1"><span class="nm">(e)</span><span class="cl">(Mishnah):</span> Bread.</p>
<p class="bas indent1"><span class="nm">(f)</span><span class="cl">(Rav Kahana):</span> <i>Beis Din</i> did not permit bread.</p>
<p class="bas indent1"><span class="nm">(g)</span><span class="cl">Suggestion:</span> This implies that there is a Chacham who permits bread!</p>
<p class="bas indent1"><span class="nm">(h)</span><span class="cl">Version #1 - Confirmation:</span> Correct! Rav Dimi said, that once Rebbi was in a field, and a Nochri brought him a Se'ah of bread baked in a big (baker's) oven;</p>
<p class="bas indent2"><span class="nm">1.</span><span class="cl">Rebbi:</span> This is beautiful bread. Why did Chachamim forbid it?!</p>
<p class="bas indent2"><span class="nm">2.</span><span class="cl">Question:</span> They forbade it due to intermarriage!</p>
<p class="bas indent2"><span class="nm">3.</span><span class="cl">Answer:</span> He asked why Chachamim forbade it even in the field (where there is no concern for intermarriage).</p>
<p class="bas indent1"><span class="nm">(i)</span><span class="cl">Rejection:</span> People understood from this that Rebbi permits bread, but this was wrong.</p>
<p class="bas indent1"><span class="nm">(j)</span><span class="cl">Version #2 (Rav Yosef):</span> Rebbi was once in a place where there was not enough bread for the Talmidim.</p>
<p class="bas indent2"><span class="nm">1.</span><span class="cl">Rebbi:</span> Is there no baker here?!</p>
<p class="bas indent2"><span class="nm">2.</span>People understood from this that Rebbi permits bread of a Nochri baker;</p>
<p class="bas indent2"><span class="nm">3.</span>This was wrong. Rebbi referred to a Yisrael baker.</p>
<p class="bas indent1"><span class="nm">(k)</span><span class="cl">(R. Chelbo):</span> Even the opinion that permits bread of a Nochri baker, permits only where there is no Yisrael baker.</p>
<p class="bas indent1"><span class="nm">(l)</span><span class="cl">(R. Yochanan):</span> Even the opinion that permits bread of a Nochri baker (some say - where there is no Yisrael baker) permits only in the field, but not in the city, due to intermarriage.</p>
<p class="bas indent1"><span class="nm">(m)</span>Eibo was eating bread of a Nochri in the field, outside the border of the city.</p>
<p class="bas indent2"><span class="nm">1.</span><span class="cl">Rava:</span> Do not recite teachings in his name (R. Chananel - do not speak with him), for he is eating bread of a Nochri (i.e. he is not a Chaver).</p>
