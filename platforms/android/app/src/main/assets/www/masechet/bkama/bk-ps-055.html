<p class="bas subject"><span class="nm">1)</span>THE SYMBOLISM OF 'GOOD'</p>
<p class="bas indent1"><span class="nm">(a)</span><span class="cl">Question (R. Chanina ben Agil):</span> Why was "good" said in the second version of the 10 Utterances, but not in the first?</p>
<p class="bas indent1"><span class="nm">(b)</span><span class="cl">R. Chiya bar Aba:</span> I am not sure whether 'good' was said! (Perhaps the version in Parshas va'Eschanan does not correspond to what was actually written on the second tablets. See Kollel Iyun Hadaf, Insights to the Daf.)</p>
<p class="bas indent1"><span class="nm">(c)</span><span class="cl">Answer (R. Tanchum bar Chanilai):</span> It was because the first Tablets would be broken.</p>
<p class="bas indent1"><span class="nm">(d)</span><span class="cl">Question:</span> Is that a reason not to say 'good'?</p>
<p class="bas indent1"><span class="nm">(e)</span><span class="cl">Answer (Rav Ashi):</span> Hash-m did not want a Siman (omen) that 'good' would cease from Yisrael.</p>
<p class="bas indent1"><span class="nm">(f)</span><span class="cl">(R. Yehoshua ben Levi):</span> If one sees the letter 'Tes' (the first letter of Tov (good)) in a dream, this is a good Siman.</p>
<p class="bas indent1"><span class="nm">(g)</span><span class="cl">Question:</span> Also some ominous verses begin with 'Tes'!</p>
<p class="bas indent1"><span class="nm">(h)</span><span class="cl">Answer:</span> The first 'Tes' in the Torah is in the word "good".</p>
<p class="bas indent1"><span class="nm">(i)</span><span class="cl">(R. Yehoshua ben Levi):</span> If one sees eulogy in a dream, this shows that he should have died, but Hash-m had mercy and saved him.</p>
<p class="bas indent2"><span class="nm">1.</span>This applies only when the word was written.</p>
<p class="bas subject"><span class="nm">2)</span>BEASTS AND BIRDS</p>
<p class="bas indent1"><span class="nm">(a)</span><span class="cl">(Mishnah):</span> The laws apply also to Chayos and birds.</p>
<p class="bas indent1"><span class="nm">(b)</span><span class="cl">(Reish Lakish):</span> Our Mishnah teaches that chickens, peacocks and partridges are forbidden together.</p>
<p class="bas indent1"><span class="nm">(c)</span><span class="cl">Question:</span> This is obvious!</p>
<p class="bas indent1"><span class="nm">(d)</span><span class="cl">Answer (Rav Chaviva):</span> One might have thought that since they grow up together, they are one species. Reish Lakish teaches that is not so.</p>
<p class="bas indent1"><span class="nm">(e)</span><span class="cl">(Shmuel):</span> Geese and wild geese are forbidden together.</p>
<p class="bas indent1"><span class="nm">(f)</span><span class="cl">Question (Rava bar Rav Chanan):</span> What is the reason?</p>
<p class="bas indent2"><span class="nm">1.</span><span class="cl">Suggestion:</span> It is because one has a long neck (Aruch; Rashi - beak), and the other's is short.</p>
<p class="bas indent2"><span class="nm">2.</span><span class="cl">Rejection:</span> If so, Persian and Arabian camels should also be forbidden together, for one has a long neck, and the other's is short!</p>
<p class="bas indent1"><span class="nm">(g)</span><span class="cl">Answer #1 (Abaye):</span> It is because the testicles of one are seen externally, and the other's are not.</p>
<p class="bas indent1"><span class="nm">(h)</span><span class="cl">Answer #2 (Rav Papa):</span> One carries only one egg at a time, and the other carries many at a time.</p>
<p class="bas indent1"><span class="nm">(i)</span><span class="cl">(R. Yirmiyah):</span> One who mates diverse species of sea- creatures is lashed.</p>
<p class="bas indent1"><span class="nm">(j)</span><span class="cl">Question:</span> What is the reason?</p>
<p class="bas indent1"><span class="nm">(k)</span><span class="cl">Answer (Rav Ada bar Ahavah):</span> We learn a Gezeirah Shavah "l'Minehu-l'Minehu" from land animals.</p>
<p class="bas indent1"><span class="nm">(l)</span><span class="cl">Question (Rachbah):</span> May one use a goat and a fish to pull together?</p>
<p class="bas indent2"><span class="nm">1.</span>Since goats never go in the sea, and fish never go on the land (so they will not mate together), it is permitted;</p>
<p class="bas indent2"><span class="nm">2.</span>Or, since he works with them, it is forbidden.</p>
<p class="bas indent1"><span class="nm">(m)</span><span class="cl">Question (Ravina):</span> (If this were forbidden,) would one be liable for planting wheat and barley near each other, one in Eretz Yisrael and the other in Chutz la'Aretz?!</p>
<p class="bas indent1"><span class="nm">(n)</span><span class="cl">Answer:</span> That is different. One is liable for planting diverse seeds only in Eretz Yisrael, but the Isur to work with different species applies on land and in water!</p>

<p class="bas subject"><span class="nm">3)</span>GUARDING PROPERLY</p>
<p class="bas indent1"><span class="nm">(a)</span><span class="cl">(Mishnah):</span> If Reuven brought his flock into a Dir (a fenced off area for animals to fertilize the land) and locked in front of them properly; and they got out and damaged, he is exempt;</p>
<p class="bas indent2"><span class="nm">1.</span>If he locked in front of them improperly and they went out and damaged, he is liable.</p>
<p class="bas indent1"><span class="nm">(b)</span>If the wall broke at night, or if thieves broke it and an animal went out and damaged, he (and the thieves) are exempt.</p>
<p class="bas indent2"><span class="nm">1.</span>If thieves took it out and it damaged, the thieves are liable.</p>
<p class="bas indent1"><span class="nm">(c)</span>If Reuven left an animal in the sun, or gave it over to a Cheresh (deaf-mute), lunatic or child to watch and it got out and damaged, he is liable;</p>
<p class="bas indent2"><span class="nm">1.</span>If he gave it over to a shepherd to watch, the shepherd is liable in place of Reuven.</p>
<p class="bas indent1"><span class="nm">(d)</span>If it fell into a garden and benefited, Reuven pays for the benefit;</p>
<p class="bas indent2"><span class="nm">1.</span>If it went down normally and damaged, Reuven pays for the damage.</p>
<p class="bas indent1"><span class="nm">(e)</span>To evaluate the damage, we estimate how much a Beis Se'ah of the field was worth, and how much it decreased due to the damage to the one patch. (A Beis Se'ah is the area in which a Se'ah (about 12 liters) of seed are sown, i.e. 50 Amos by 50 Amos.)</p>
<p class="bas indent1"><span class="nm">(f)</span>R. Shimon says, if it ate finished fruit, it pays for finished fruit. If it ate one Se'ah, it pays for one Se'ah. If it ate two Sa'im, it pays for two Sa'im.</p>
<p class="bas indent1"><span class="nm">(g)</span><span class="cl">(Gemara - Beraisa) Question:</span> What is considered proper guarding?</p>
<p class="bas indent1"><span class="nm">(h)</span><span class="cl">Answer:</span> A door that can stand in a normal wind is proper. If it cannot stand in a normal wind, this is improper.</p>
<p class="bas indent1"><span class="nm">(i)</span><span class="cl">(R. Mani bar Patish):</span> Our Mishnah is like R. Yehudah, who says that a poor guarding suffices for a Mu'ad.</p>
<p class="bas indent2"><span class="nm">1.</span><span class="cl">(Mishnah - R. Meir):</span> If Reuven tied his ox with a rope, and locked in front of it properly, and it escaped and damaged, he is liable, whether it is a Tam or Mu'ad;</p>
<p class="bas indent2"><span class="nm">2.</span>R. Yehudah says, a Tam is liable, and a Mu'ad is exempt. It says "if he will not guard it", and this is guarded!</p>
<p class="bas indent2"><span class="nm">3.</span>R. Elazar says, a Mu'ad cannot be guarded, it must be killed.</p>
<p class="bas indent1"><span class="nm">(j)</span><span class="cl">Rejection:</span> The Beraisa can even be like R. Meir. Shen and Regel are different, for the Torah said that they need not be guarded so well.</p>
<p class="bas indent2"><span class="nm">1.</span><span class="cl">(R. Elazar):</span> The Torah minimized the guarding needed for four things: a pit, fire, Shen and Regel.</p>
<p class="bas indent3"><span class="nm">i.</span>It says about a pit "if a man will open a pit or dig a pit and not cover it." Had he covered it, he would be exempt;</p>
<p class="bas indent3"><span class="nm">ii.</span>It says about fire "the one who burned will pay" - only if he was (negligent) like one who burns;</p>
<p class="bas indent3"><span class="nm">iii.</span>It says about Shen "it consumed in another's field" - he is liable only if it is as if he made it consume;</p>
<p class="bas indent3"><span class="nm">iv.</span>It says about Regel "and he sent" - only if he is like one who sent.</p>
<p class="bas indent1"><span class="nm">(k)</span><span class="cl">(Beraisa):</span> "And he sent" is Regel - "sending the Regel of oxen and donkeys".</p>
<p class="bas indent2"><span class="nm">1.</span>"And it will consume" is Shen - "like the Galal (tooth) will consume"</p>
<p class="bas indent2"><span class="nm">2.</span>He is liable only if it is like one who sent and consumed.</p>
<p class="bas indent1"><span class="nm">(l)</span><span class="cl">(Rabah):</span> We may also derive this from our Mishnah!</p>
<p class="bas indent2"><span class="nm">1.</span>Until now, the Mishnayos discussed an ox. In our Mishnah it switched to 'flock' (which do not gore, they only damage through Shen and Regel);</p>
<p class="bas indent2"><span class="nm">2.</span>The Torah said that a weak guarding suffices, even though (others explain - because) they are Mu'ad from the beginning.</p>
<p class="bas subject"><span class="nm">4)</span>LIABILITY B'YEDEI SHAMAYIM</p>
<p class="bas indent1"><span class="nm">(a)</span><span class="cl">(Beraisa - R. Yehoshua):</span> There are four things for which one is exempt b'Yedei Adam, but liable b'Yedei Shamayim:</p>
<p class="bas indent2"><span class="nm">1.</span>Breaching a fence in front of Reuven's animal;</p>
<p class="bas indent2"><span class="nm">2.</span>Bending Reuven's crop in front of a fire (so it will burn);</p>
<p class="bas indent2"><span class="nm">3.</span>Hiring false witnesses;</p>
<p class="bas indent2"><span class="nm">4.</span>Not testifying when one knows testimony that could help Reuven.</p>
<p class="bas indent1"><span class="nm">(b)</span><span class="cl">Question:</span> What is the case of breaching a fence in front of Reuven's animal?</p>
<p class="bas indent2"><span class="nm">1.</span>If the fence is strong, he is liable b'Yedei Adam (for the fence)!</p>
<p class="bas indent1"><span class="nm">(c)</span><span class="cl">Answer:</span> Rather, the fence is weak.</p>
