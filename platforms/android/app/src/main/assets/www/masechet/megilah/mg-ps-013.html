<p class="bas subject"><span class="nm">1)</span>EXPOUNDING NAMES IN THE <i>MEGILAH </i>(cont.)</p>
<p class="bas indent1"><span class="nm">(a)</span><span class="cl">Answer #4 (Rava):</span> Keneses Yisrael <i>blames</i> Yehudah and Binyamin for what happened:</p>
<p class="bas indent2"><span class="nm">1.</span>It blames Yehudah for not killing Shim'i, which enabled the birth of Mordechai, who provoked Haman;</p>
<p class="bas indent2"><span class="nm">2.</span>It blames Binyamin (from which came Sha'ul) for not killing Agag, from whom came Haman.</p>
<p class="bas indent1"><span class="nm">(b)</span><span class="cl">Answer #5 (R. Yochanan):</span> Really, Mordechai comes from Binyamin. He is called Yehudi because he denied idolatry;</p>
<p class="bas indent2"><span class="nm">1.</span>Anyone who denies idolatry is called Yehudi, like it says "these Yehudi men... (do not bow to Your image)".</p>
<p class="bas indent1"><span class="nm">(c)</span>When R. Yehudah ben Pazi would start to expound Divrei ha'Yomim, he would say 'All Your words are one (even though many names are often given for the same person), and we know how to expound them!'</p>
<p class="bas indent1"><span class="nm">(d)</span><span class="cl">Question:</span> "His wife ha'Yehudiyah gave birth to Yered... " - why is Basyah called Yehudiyah?</p>
<p class="bas indent1"><span class="nm">(e)</span><span class="cl">Answer:</span> It is because she denied idolatry;</p>
<p class="bas indent2"><span class="nm">1.</span><span class="cl">(R. Yochanan):</span> "Paro's daughter went down to wash in the river" - she descended to cleanse herself  from the idolatry of her father's house.</p>
<p class="bas indent1"><span class="nm">(f)</span><span class="cl">Question:</span> Why does it say that she gave birth to him (Moshe)? She (only) raised him!</p>
<p class="bas indent1"><span class="nm">(g)</span><span class="cl">Answer:</span> This teaches that if one raises an orphan in his house, is considered as if he fathered him.</p>
<p class="bas indent1"><span class="nm">(h)</span>"Yered" is Moshe. He is called Yered because manna Yarad (descended) for Yisrael in his days.</p>
<p class="bas indent1"><span class="nm">(i)</span>He is (also) called "Gedor" because he was Goder (fenced) the breaches in Yisrael.</p>
<p class="bas indent1"><span class="nm">(j)</span>He is called "Chever" because he was Mechaber (connected) Yisrael to their father in Heaven.</p>
<p class="bas indent1"><span class="nm">(k)</span>He is called "Socho" because he was like a (protecting) Sukah to Yisrael.</p>
<p class="bas indent1"><span class="nm">(l)</span>He is called "Yekusi'el" because <i>K</i>avu Yi<i>S</i>rael la'K<i>el</i> (Yisrael hoped to Hash-m) in his day.</p>
<p class="bas indent1"><span class="nm">(m)</span>He is called "Zanu'ach" because Hizni'ach (he made Yisrael abandon) their sins.</p>
<p class="bas indent1"><span class="nm">(n)</span>It says "Father of" three times, because he was a father in Torah, in wisdom, and in prophecy.</p>
<p class="bas indent1"><span class="nm">(o)</span><span class="cl">Question:</span> Why does it say "Basyah, whom Mered married"? Kalev married her!</p>
<p class="bas indent1"><span class="nm">(p)</span><span class="cl">Answer:</span> Hash-m said 'Kalev, who was Mored (rebelled) against the counsel of the Meraglim, should marry Basyah, who rebelled against her father's idolatry.'</p>
<p class="bas indent1"><span class="nm">(q)</span><span class="cl">(Rava):</span> "Who was exiled from Yerushalayim (with those whom Nevuchadnetzar forcibly exiled)" - Mordechai willingly exiled himself.</p>
<p class="bas indent1"><span class="nm">(r)</span><span class="cl">Question:</span> Why does it say "He raised Hadasah"? Elsewhere she is called Esther!</p>
<p class="bas indent1"><span class="nm">(s)</span><span class="cl">Answer #1 (Beraisa - R. Meir):</span> Her name is Esther. Tzadikim are called Hadasah - "And he stands among the Hadasim".</p>
<p class="bas indent1"><span class="nm">(t)</span><span class="cl">Answer #2A (R. Yehudah):</span> Her name is Hadasah. She is called Esther because she was Masteres (hid) her words - "Esther does not tell which is her nation."</p>
<p class="bas indent1"><span class="nm">(u)</span><span class="cl">Answer #2B (R. Nechemyah):</span> Her name is Hadasah. The nations called her Esther because she was beautiful like Istahar (the moon).</p>
<p class="bas indent1"><span class="nm">(v)</span><span class="cl">(Ben Azai):</span> Esther was not tall or short; she was average, like a Hadasah (myrtle).</p>
<p class="bas indent1"><span class="nm">(w)</span><span class="cl">(R. Yehoshua ben Korchah):</span> Esther was green (like myrtle); Hash-m strung Chesed over her (so all considered her beautiful).</p>
<p class="bas subject"><span class="nm">2)</span>THE SELECTION OF ESTHER</p>
<p class="bas indent1"><span class="nm">(a)</span><span class="cl">Question:</span> Why does it say "For she has no father or mother", and also "When her father and mother died"?</p>
<p class="bas indent1"><span class="nm">(b)</span><span class="cl">Answer (Rav Acha):</span> When her mother became pregnant, her father died; when she was born, her mother died.</p>
<p class="bas indent1"><span class="nm">(c)</span><span class="cl">(Beraisa - R. Meir):</span> "Mordechai took her l'Bas (for a daughter)" - we read this l'Bayis (a wife).</p>
<p class="bas indent2"><span class="nm">1.</span>Similarly, "The poor man has nothing, except for one small sheep (a metaphor for Uriyah, who had only Bas Sheva)... it sleeps in his bosom and was to him like a Bas.</p>
<p class="bas indent2"><span class="nm">2.</span><span class="cl">Question:</span> Sleeping in his bosom is no reason to call it a daughter!</p>
<p class="bas indent2"><span class="nm">3.</span><span class="cl">Answer:</span> We must read this 'k'Bayis' (and similarly regarding Esther).</p>
<p class="bas indent1"><span class="nm">(d)</span><span class="cl">(Rava):</span> "And the seven young girls" - Esther would count the days of the week through them (to know when it is Shabbos).</p>
<p class="bas indent1"><span class="nm">(e)</span><span class="cl">Opinion #1 (Rav):</span> "And he (Hegai) changed her and her girls" - he fed her food of Yisraelim.</p>
<p class="bas indent1"><span class="nm">(f)</span><span class="cl">Opinion#2 (Shmuel):</span> He fed her necks of swine. (Tosfos - she did not eat them; Rashi - she was not punished for eating them, for she was forced.)</p>
<p class="bas indent1"><span class="nm">(g)</span><span class="cl">Opinion#3 (R. Yochanan):</span> He fed her seeds (like Daniel, Chananyah, Misha'el and Azaryah ate) - "The steward removed the royal food and gave them seeds."</p>
<p class="bas indent1"><span class="nm">(h)</span><span class="cl">Question:</span> "Six months with Shemen ha'Mor" - what is this?</p>
<p class="bas indent1"><span class="nm">(i)</span><span class="cl">Answer #1 (R. Chiya bar Aba):</span> It is satchet.</p>
<p class="bas indent1"><span class="nm">(j)</span><span class="cl">Answer #2 (Rav Huna):</span> It is oil of olives that did not reach one third growth;</p>
<p class="bas indent2"><span class="nm">1.</span><span class="cl">(Beraisa - R. Yehudah):</span> Anfekinon is oil of olives that did not grow a third.</p>
<p class="bas indent1"><span class="nm">(k)</span>Girls anoint with it to make hair fall out and to soften the skin.</p>
<p class="bas indent1"><span class="nm">(l)</span><span class="cl">(R. Yochanan):</span> "In the evening she comes, and in the morning she returns" - amidst the detriment of the Rasha we hear his praise, that he would not have relations during the day.</p>
<p class="bas indent1"><span class="nm">(m)</span><span class="cl">(R. Elazar):</span> "And Esther bore grace" - every person thought that she was from his nation.</p>
<p class="bas indent1"><span class="nm">(n)</span>"Esther was taken in the month of Teves" - this is winter, when a body enjoys (the warmth of) another body.</p>
<p class="bas indent1"><span class="nm">(o)</span><span class="cl">(Rav):</span> "And the king loved Esther more than all the women... and more than all the virgins" - if he desired the 'taste' of (relations with) a virgin, he tasted it; if he desired a non-virgin, he tasted it.</p>
<p class="bas indent1"><span class="nm">(p)</span>"The king made a great party", but she did not reveal (her nation to him); he pardoned taxes (in her honor), and she did not reveal; he sent gifts (to nobles in her name), and she did not reveal.</p>
<p class="bas indent1"><span class="nm">(q)</span>"When virgins were gathered a second time" - Mordechai counseled him that a woman envies only a marital rival. Even so, "Esther did not tell her origin".</p>
<p class="bas bbbline">13b----------------------------------------13b</p>
<p class="bas indent1"><span class="nm">(r)</span><span class="cl">(R. Elazar):</span> "Hash-m's eyes do not overlook (reward due to) a Tzadik" - as a reward for Rachel's Tzni'us (modesty), Sha'ul descended from her; as a reward for Sha'ul's Tzni'us, Esther descended from him.</p>
<p class="bas indent2"><span class="nm">1.</span><span class="cl">Question:</span> What was Rachel's Tzni'us?</p>
<p class="bas indent2"><span class="nm">2.</span><span class="cl">Answer - Question:</span> "Yakov told Rachel that he is her father's brother" - he is her father's nephew!</p>
<p class="bas indent3"><span class="nm">i.</span><span class="cl">Answer:</span> Yakov asked her to marry him; she agreed, but said 'My father is a deceiver, and you cannot overcome him.'</p>
<p class="bas indent3"><span class="nm">ii.</span><span class="cl">Yakov:</span> I am his brother in deceit.</p>
<p class="bas indent3"><span class="nm">iii.</span><span class="cl">Rachel:</span> May a Tzadik do so?!</p>
<p class="bas indent3"><span class="nm">iv.</span><span class="cl">Yakov:</span> Yes; "With a pure one, be clear, with a crooked one, be crooked." What is his trickery?</p>
<p class="bas indent3"><span class="nm">v.</span><span class="cl">Rachel:</span> I have an older sister, he will not marry me off before her.</p>
<p class="bas indent3"><span class="nm">vi.</span>Yakov gave to her Simanim. When the night (of the wedding) came, Rachel feared that her sister will be shamed, so she gave the Simanim to Leah.</p>
<p class="bas indent3"><span class="nm">vii.</span><span class="cl">Support - Question:</span> "In the morning, behold it was Leah" - until now, it was it not Leah?</p>
<p class="bas indent3"><span class="nm">viii.</span><span class="cl">Answer:</span> Rather, because of the Simanim which Rachel gave to Leah, Yakov did not know until morning.</p>
<p class="bas indent1"><span class="nm">(s)</span><span class="cl">Question:</span> What was Sha'ul's Tzni'us?</p>
<p class="bas indent1"><span class="nm">(t)</span><span class="cl">Answer:</span> "He did not tell to him (his uncle) about the kingship" (that Sha'ul will be king).</p>
<p class="bas indent1"><span class="nm">(u)</span><span class="cl">(R. Elazar):</span> When Hash-m apportions greatness to a person, he apportions to his children and grandchildren for all generations - "He seated them (kings) forever, and elevated him";</p>
<p class="bas indent2"><span class="nm">1.</span>If the person gets haughty, Hash-m lowers him - "If they will be bound in fetters."</p>
<p class="bas subject"><span class="nm">3)</span>MORDECHAI SAVED THE KING</p>
<p class="bas indent1"><span class="nm">(a)</span><span class="cl">(R. Yirmeyah):</span> "And Esther fulfilled the words of Mordechai" - she showed her Dam Nidah to the Chachamim.</p>
<p class="bas indent1"><span class="nm">(b)</span><span class="cl">(Rabah bar Leima):</span> "As she used to when he raised her" - she would get up from the bosom of Achashverosh, immerse, and sit in the bosom of Mordechai.</p>
<p class="bas indent1"><span class="nm">(c)</span><span class="cl">(R. Chiya bar Aba):</span> Hash-m made a master (Paro) angry at his servants, to do the will of a Tzadik, i.e. Yosef - "And there was with us a young Ivri... "</p>
<p class="bas indent1"><span class="nm">(d)</span>Hash-m angered servants on their master to do the will of a Tzadik, i.e. Mordechai - "Bigsan and Seresh got angry... and the matter became known to Mordechai."</p>
<p class="bas indent1"><span class="nm">(e)</span><span class="cl">(R. Yochanan):</span> Bigsan and Seresh were Tarsiyim, and spoke in Torsi. 'From the day Achashverosh came, we have not slept. Let us put poison in the bowl so he will die.' They did not know that Mordechai was from the Sanhedrin and knew all 70 languages.</p>
<p class="bas indent1"><span class="nm">(f)</span>One said 'Our watches are not the same; I will guard both of them.'</p>
<p class="bas indent1"><span class="nm">(g)</span>This explains "the matter was investigated and it was found" - they were not at their watches.</p>
<p class="bas indent1"><span class="nm">(h)</span><span class="cl">Question:</span> Why does it say "After these things... ."?</p>
<p class="bas indent1"><span class="nm">(i)</span><span class="cl">Answer (Rava):</span> (Haman was raised) after Hash-m created the cure (a reason for Achashverosh to love Mordechai) for the malady.</p>
<p class="bas indent2"><span class="nm">1.</span>This is like Reish Lakish said, that Hash-m does not strike Yisrael unless he creates the cure first - "When I cure Yisrael, (afterwards) the sin of Efrayim is revealed (through the punishment)."</p>
<p class="bas indent2"><span class="nm">2.</span>Regarding other nations, Hash-m strikes first and then creates the cure - "Hash-m will strike Mitzrayim, a blow and (then a) cure."</p>
<p class="bas subject"><span class="nm">4)</span>THE DECREE OF HAMAN</p>
<p class="bas indent1"><span class="nm">(a)</span><span class="cl">(Rava):</span> "It was scornful in his eyes to strike Mordechai alone" - first (he wanted to kill) Mordechai alone; later, the nation of Mordechai, i.e. Chachamim; in the end, all the Jews.</p>
<p class="bas indent1"><span class="nm">(b)</span><span class="cl">(Beraisa):</span> "He cast a Pur (lottery)" - when the lottery fell in Adar, he was exceedingly happy, for it fell in the month of Moshe's death.</p>
<p class="bas indent2"><span class="nm">1.</span>He did not know that Moshe died and was born on the seventh of Adar.</p>
<p class="bas indent1"><span class="nm">(c)</span><span class="cl">(Rava):</span> "Yeshnu (there is) Am Echad)... " - no one knows how to speak Lashon ha'Ra as well as Haman:</p>
<p class="bas indent2"><span class="nm">1.</span><span class="cl">Haman:</span> Let us destroy them.</p>
<p class="bas indent2"><span class="nm">2.</span><span class="cl">Achashverosh:</span> I am afraid lest their G-d do to me like He did to those before me (e.g. Paro or Sancheriv).</p>
<p class="bas indent2"><span class="nm">3.</span><span class="cl">Haman:</span> (You need not worry, for) Yashnu (Yisrael are sleeping) from the Mitzvos.</p>
<p class="bas indent2"><span class="nm">4.</span><span class="cl">Achashverosh:</span> There are Rabanim among them (who are doing Mitzvos)!</p>
<p class="bas indent2"><span class="nm">5.</span><span class="cl">Haman:</span> They are one nation (all are sleeping).</p>
<p class="bas indent2"><span class="nm">6.</span>Do not think that I will make a bald patch in your kingdom - "They are scattered among the nations";</p>
<p class="bas indent2"><span class="nm">7.</span>Do not think that there is benefit from them - "u'Mefurad" they are scattered like a Predah (mule) which bears no fruit" (Maharsha - we expound u'Mefurad because it is extra, it already says "Mefuzar");</p>
<p class="bas indent2"><span class="nm">8.</span>Do not think that there is a small province of them - "in all provinces of your kingdom" (Rashi; Maharsha - he already said that he will not make a bald patch because they are scattered! Rather, do not think that you can gather and resettle them in a small province, for there are too many - "in all (127) provinces of your kingdom").</p>
<p class="bas indent2"><span class="nm">9.</span>"Their laws are different from every nation" - they do not eat our food, and don't marry our women or our men.</p>
<p class="bas indent2"><span class="nm">10.</span>"They do not keep the king's laws" - all year they avoid work, saying 'Today is Shabbos, today is Pesach.'</p>
<p class="bas indent2"><span class="nm">11.</span>"It is not worth leaving them (alive)" - they eat and drink and despise the kingdom! If one of them found a fly in his wine, he removes the fly and drinks. If you would touch the cup, he would spill it on the ground and not drink it.</p>
<p class="bas indent1"><span class="nm">(d)</span><span class="cl">(Reish Lakish):</span> "(I will give) 10,000 talents of silver (to destroy them) - Hash-m knew that Haman would offer Shekalim to destroy Yisrael, therefore Hash-m commanded that we give Shekalim first (to redeem ourselves);</p>
<p class="bas indent2"><span class="nm">1.</span><span class="cl">(Mishnah):</span> On the first of Adar we announce about Shekalim...</p>
