<div class="indent1"><span class="nm">(a)</span><p><span class="cl">Answer #4 (Rava):</span> Keneses Yisrael <i>blames</i> Yehudah and Binyamin for what happened:</p></div>
<div class="indent2"><span class="nm">1.</span><p>It blames Yehudah for not killing Shim'i, which enabled the birth of Mordechai, who provoked Haman;</p></div>
<div class="indent2"><span class="nm">2.</span><p>It blames Binyamin (from which came Sha'ul) for not killing Agag, from whom came Haman.</p></div>
<div class="indent1"><span class="nm">(b)</span><p><span class="cl">Answer #5 (R. Yochanan):</span> Really, Mordechai comes from Binyamin. He is called Yehudi because he denied idolatry;</p></div>
<div class="indent2"><span class="nm">1.</span><p>Anyone who denies idolatry is called Yehudi, like it says "these Yehudi men... (do not bow to Your image)".</p></div>
<div class="indent1"><span class="nm">(c)</span><p>When R. Yehudah ben Pazi would start to expound Divrei ha'Yomim, he would say 'All Your words are one (even though many names are often given for the same person), and we know how to expound them!'</p></div>
<div class="indent1"><span class="nm">(d)</span><p><span class="cl">Question:</span> "His wife ha'Yehudiyah gave birth to Yered... " - why is Basyah called Yehudiyah?</p></div>
<div class="indent1"><span class="nm">(e)</span><p><span class="cl">Answer:</span> It is because she denied idolatry;</p></div>
<div class="indent2"><span class="nm">1.</span><p><span class="cl">(R. Yochanan):</span> "Paro's daughter went down to wash in the river" - she descended to cleanse herself  from the idolatry of her father's house.</p></div>
<div class="indent1"><span class="nm">(f)</span><p><span class="cl">Question:</span> Why does it say that she gave birth to him (Moshe)? She (only) raised him!</p></div>
<div class="indent1"><span class="nm">(g)</span><p><span class="cl">Answer:</span> This teaches that if one raises an orphan in his house, is considered as if he fathered him.</p></div>
<div class="indent1"><span class="nm">(h)</span><p>"Yered" is Moshe. He is called Yered because manna Yarad (descended) for Yisrael in his days.</p></div>
<div class="indent1"><span class="nm">(i)</span><p>He is (also) called "Gedor" because he was Goder (fenced) the breaches in Yisrael.</p></div>
<div class="indent1"><span class="nm">(j)</span><p>He is called "Chever" because he was Mechaber (connected) Yisrael to their father in Heaven.</p></div>
<div class="indent1"><span class="nm">(k)</span><p>He is called "Socho" because he was like a (protecting) Sukah to Yisrael.</p></div>
<div class="indent1"><span class="nm">(l)</span><p>He is called "Yekusi'el" because <i>K</i>avu Yi<i>S</i>rael la'K<i>el</i> (Yisrael hoped to Hash-m) in his day.</p></div>
<div class="indent1"><span class="nm">(m)</span><p>He is called "Zanu'ach" because Hizni'ach (he made Yisrael abandon) their sins.</p></div>
<div class="indent1"><span class="nm">(n)</span><p>It says "Father of" three times, because he was a father in Torah, in wisdom, and in prophecy.</p></div>
<div class="indent1"><span class="nm">(o)</span><p><span class="cl">Question:</span> Why does it say "Basyah, whom Mered married"? Kalev married her!</p></div>
<div class="indent1"><span class="nm">(p)</span><p><span class="cl">Answer:</span> Hash-m said 'Kalev, who was Mored (rebelled) against the counsel of the Meraglim, should marry Basyah, who rebelled against her father's idolatry.'</p></div>
<div class="indent1"><span class="nm">(q)</span><p><span class="cl">(Rava):</span> "Who was exiled from Yerushalayim (with those whom Nevuchadnetzar forcibly exiled)" - Mordechai willingly exiled himself.</p></div>
<div class="indent1"><span class="nm">(r)</span><p><span class="cl">Question:</span> Why does it say "He raised Hadasah"? Elsewhere she is called Esther!</p></div>
<div class="indent1"><span class="nm">(s)</span><p><span class="cl">Answer #1 (Beraisa - R. Meir):</span> Her name is Esther. Tzadikim are called Hadasah - "And he stands among the Hadasim".</p></div>
<div class="indent1"><span class="nm">(t)</span><p><span class="cl">Answer #2A (R. Yehudah):</span> Her name is Hadasah. She is called Esther because she was Masteres (hid) her words - "Esther does not tell which is her nation."</p></div>
<div class="indent1"><span class="nm">(u)</span><p><span class="cl">Answer #2B (R. Nechemyah):</span> Her name is Hadasah. The nations called her Esther because she was beautiful like Istahar (the moon).</p></div>
<div class="indent1"><span class="nm">(v)</span><p><span class="cl">(Ben Azai):</span> Esther was not tall or short; she was average, like a Hadasah (myrtle).</p></div>
<div class="indent1"><span class="nm">(w)</span><p><span class="cl">(R. Yehoshua ben Korchah):</span> Esther was green (like myrtle); Hash-m strung Chesed over her (so all considered her beautiful).</p></div>
<div class="subject"><span class="nm">2)</span><p>THE SELECTION OF ESTHER</p></div>
<div class="indent1"><span class="nm">(a)</span><p><span class="cl">Question:</span> Why does it say "For she has no father or mother", and also "When her father and mother died"?</p></div>
<div class="indent1"><span class="nm">(b)</span><p><span class="cl">Answer (Rav Acha):</span> When her mother became pregnant, her father died; when she was born, her mother died.</p></div>
<div class="indent1"><span class="nm">(c)</span><p><span class="cl">(Beraisa - R. Meir):</span> "Mordechai took her l'Bas (for a daughter)" - we read this l'Bayis (a wife).</p></div>
<div class="indent2"><span class="nm">1.</span><p>Similarly, "The poor man has nothing, except for one small sheep (a metaphor for Uriyah, who had only Bas Sheva)... it sleeps in his bosom and was to him like a Bas.</p></div>
<div class="indent2"><span class="nm">2.</span><p><span class="cl">Question:</span> Sleeping in his bosom is no reason to call it a daughter!</p></div>
<div class="indent2"><span class="nm">3.</span><p><span class="cl">Answer:</span> We must read this 'k'Bayis' (and similarly regarding Esther).</p></div>
<div class="indent1"><span class="nm">(d)</span><p><span class="cl">(Rava):</span> "And the seven young girls" - Esther would count the days of the week through them (to know when it is Shabbos).</p></div>
<div class="indent1"><span class="nm">(e)</span><p><span class="cl">Opinion #1 (Rav):</span> "And he (Hegai) changed her and her girls" - he fed her food of Yisraelim.</p></div>
<div class="indent1"><span class="nm">(f)</span><p><span class="cl">Opinion#2 (Shmuel):</span> He fed her necks of swine. (Tosfos - she did not eat them; Rashi - she was not punished for eating them, for she was forced.)</p></div>
<div class="indent1"><span class="nm">(g)</span><p><span class="cl">Opinion#3 (R. Yochanan):</span> He fed her seeds (like Daniel, Chananyah, Misha'el and Azaryah ate) - "The steward removed the royal food and gave them seeds."</p></div>
<div class="indent1"><span class="nm">(h)</span><p><span class="cl">Question:</span> "Six months with Shemen ha'Mor" - what is this?</p></div>
<div class="indent1"><span class="nm">(i)</span><p><span class="cl">Answer #1 (R. Chiya bar Aba):</span> It is satchet.</p></div>
<div class="indent1"><span class="nm">(j)</span><p><span class="cl">Answer #2 (Rav Huna):</span> It is oil of olives that did not reach one third growth;</p></div>
<div class="indent2"><span class="nm">1.</span><p><span class="cl">(Beraisa - R. Yehudah):</span> Anfekinon is oil of olives that did not grow a third.</p></div>
<div class="indent1"><span class="nm">(k)</span><p>Girls anoint with it to make hair fall out and to soften the skin.</p></div>
<div class="indent1"><span class="nm">(l)</span><p><span class="cl">(R. Yochanan):</span> "In the evening she comes, and in the morning she returns" - amidst the detriment of the Rasha we hear his praise, that he would not have relations during the day.</p></div>
<div class="indent1"><span class="nm">(m)</span><p><span class="cl">(R. Elazar):</span> "And Esther bore grace" - every person thought that she was from his nation.</p></div>
<div class="indent1"><span class="nm">(n)</span><p>"Esther was taken in the month of Teves" - this is winter, when a body enjoys (the warmth of) another body.</p></div>
<div class="indent1"><span class="nm">(o)</span><p><span class="cl">(Rav):</span> "And the king loved Esther more than all the women... and more than all the virgins" - if he desired the 'taste' of (relations with) a virgin, he tasted it; if he desired a non-virgin, he tasted it.</p></div>
<div class="indent1"><span class="nm">(p)</span><p>"The king made a great party", but she did not reveal (her nation to him); he pardoned taxes (in her honor), and she did not reveal; he sent gifts (to nobles in her name), and she did not reveal.</p></div>
<div class="indent1"><span class="nm">(q)</span><p>"When virgins were gathered a second time" - Mordechai counseled him that a woman envies only a marital rival. Even so, "Esther did not tell her origin".</p></div>
<div class="bbbline">13b----------------------------------------13b</p></div>
<div class="indent1"><span class="nm">(r)</span><p><span class="cl">(R. Elazar):</span> "Hash-m's eyes do not overlook (reward due to) a Tzadik" - as a reward for Rachel's Tzni'us (modesty), Sha'ul descended from her; as a reward for Sha'ul's Tzni'us, Esther descended from him.</p></div>
<div class="indent2"><span class="nm">1.</span><p><span class="cl">Question:</span> What was Rachel's Tzni'us?</p></div>
<div class="indent2"><span class="nm">2.</span><p><span class="cl">Answer - Question:</span> "Yakov told Rachel that he is her father's brother" - he is her father's nephew!</p></div>
<div class="indent3"><span class="nm">i.</span><p><span class="cl">Answer:</span> Yakov asked her to marry him; she agreed, but said 'My father is a deceiver, and you cannot overcome him.'</p></div>
<div class="indent3"><span class="nm">ii.</span><p><span class="cl">Yakov:</span> I am his brother in deceit.</p></div>
<div class="indent3"><span class="nm">iii.</span><p><span class="cl">Rachel:</span> May a Tzadik do so?!</p></div>
<div class="indent3"><span class="nm">iv.</span><p><span class="cl">Yakov:</span> Yes; "With a pure one, be clear, with a crooked one, be crooked." What is his trickery?</p></div>
<div class="indent3"><span class="nm">v.</span><p><span class="cl">Rachel:</span> I have an older sister, he will not marry me off before her.</p></div>
<div class="indent3"><span class="nm">vi.</span><p>Yakov gave to her Simanim. When the night (of the wedding) came, Rachel feared that her sister will be shamed, so she gave the Simanim to Leah.</p></div>
<div class="indent3"><span class="nm">vii.</span><p><span class="cl">Support - Question:</span> "In the morning, behold it was Leah" - until now, it was it not Leah?</p></div>
<div class="indent3"><span class="nm">viii.</span><p><span class="cl">Answer:</span> Rather, because of the Simanim which Rachel gave to Leah, Yakov did not know until morning.</p></div>
<div class="indent1"><span class="nm">(s)</span><p><span class="cl">Question:</span> What was Sha'ul's Tzni'us?</p></div>
<div class="indent1"><span class="nm">(t)</span><p><span class="cl">Answer:</span> "He did not tell to him (his uncle) about the kingship" (that Sha'ul will be king).</p></div>
<div class="indent1"><span class="nm">(u)</span><p><span class="cl">(R. Elazar):</span> When Hash-m apportions greatness to a person, he apportions to his children and grandchildren for all generations - "He seated them (kings) forever, and elevated him";</p></div>
<div class="indent2"><span class="nm">1.</span><p>If the person gets haughty, Hash-m lowers him - "If they will be bound in fetters."</p></div>
<div class="subject"><span class="nm">3)</span><p>MORDECHAI SAVED THE KING</p></div>
<div class="indent1"><span class="nm">(a)</span><p><span class="cl">(R. Yirmeyah):</span> "And Esther fulfilled the words of Mordechai" - she showed her Dam Nidah to the Chachamim.</p></div>
<div class="indent1"><span class="nm">(b)</span><p><span class="cl">(Rabah bar Leima):</span> "As she used to when he raised her" - she would get up from the bosom of Achashverosh, immerse, and sit in the bosom of Mordechai.</p></div>
<div class="indent1"><span class="nm">(c)</span><p><span class="cl">(R. Chiya bar Aba):</span> Hash-m made a master (Paro) angry at his servants, to do the will of a Tzadik, i.e. Yosef - "And there was with us a young Ivri... "</p></div>
<div class="indent1"><span class="nm">(d)</span><p>Hash-m angered servants on their master to do the will of a Tzadik, i.e. Mordechai - "Bigsan and Seresh got angry... and the matter became known to Mordechai."</p></div>
<div class="indent1"><span class="nm">(e)</span><p><span class="cl">(R. Yochanan):</span> Bigsan and Seresh were Tarsiyim, and spoke in Torsi. 'From the day Achashverosh came, we have not slept. Let us put poison in the bowl so he will die.' They did not know that Mordechai was from the Sanhedrin and knew all 70 languages.</p></div>
<div class="indent1"><span class="nm">(f)</span><p>One said 'Our watches are not the same; I will guard both of them.'</p></div>
<div class="indent1"><span class="nm">(g)</span><p>This explains "the matter was investigated and it was found" - they were not at their watches.</p></div>
<div class="indent1"><span class="nm">(h)</span><p><span class="cl">Question:</span> Why does it say "After these things... ."?</p></div>
<div class="indent1"><span class="nm">(i)</span><p><span class="cl">Answer (Rava):</span> (Haman was raised) after Hash-m created the cure (a reason for Achashverosh to love Mordechai) for the malady.</p></div>
<div class="indent2"><span class="nm">1.</span><p>This is like Reish Lakish said, that Hash-m does not strike Yisrael unless he creates the cure first - "When I cure Yisrael, (afterwards) the sin of Efrayim is revealed (through the punishment)."</p></div>
<div class="indent2"><span class="nm">2.</span><p>Regarding other nations, Hash-m strikes first and then creates the cure - "Hash-m will strike Mitzrayim, a blow and (then a) cure."</p></div>
<div class="subject"><span class="nm">4)</span><p>THE DECREE OF HAMAN</p></div>
<div class="indent1"><span class="nm">(a)</span><p><span class="cl">(Rava):</span> "It was scornful in his eyes to strike Mordechai alone" - first (he wanted to kill) Mordechai alone; later, the nation of Mordechai, i.e. Chachamim; in the end, all the Jews.</p></div>
<div class="indent1"><span class="nm">(b)</span><p><span class="cl">(Beraisa):</span> "He cast a Pur (lottery)" - when the lottery fell in Adar, he was exceedingly happy, for it fell in the month of Moshe's death.</p></div>
<div class="indent2"><span class="nm">1.</span><p>He did not know that Moshe died and was born on the seventh of Adar.</p></div>
<div class="indent1"><span class="nm">(c)</span><p><span class="cl">(Rava):</span> "Yeshnu (there is) Am Echad)... " - no one knows how to speak Lashon ha'Ra as well as Haman:</p></div>
<div class="indent2"><span class="nm">1.</span><p><span class="cl">Haman:</span> Let us destroy them.</p></div>
<div class="indent2"><span class="nm">2.</span><p><span class="cl">Achashverosh:</span> I am afraid lest their G-d do to me like He did to those before me (e.g. Paro or Sancheriv).</p></div>
<div class="indent2"><span class="nm">3.</span><p><span class="cl">Haman:</span> (You need not worry, for) Yashnu (Yisrael are sleeping) from the Mitzvos.</p></div>
<div class="indent2"><span class="nm">4.</span><p><span class="cl">Achashverosh:</span> There are Rabanim among them (who are doing Mitzvos)!</p></div>
<div class="indent2"><span class="nm">5.</span><p><span class="cl">Haman:</span> They are one nation (all are sleeping).</p></div>
<div class="indent2"><span class="nm">6.</span><p>Do not think that I will make a bald patch in your kingdom - "They are scattered among the nations";</p></div>
<div class="indent2"><span class="nm">7.</span><p>Do not think that there is benefit from them - "u'Mefurad" they are scattered like a Predah (mule) which bears no fruit" (Maharsha - we expound u'Mefurad because it is extra, it already says "Mefuzar");</p></div>
<div class="indent2"><span class="nm">8.</span><p>Do not think that there is a small province of them - "in all provinces of your kingdom" (Rashi; Maharsha - he already said that he will not make a bald patch because they are scattered! Rather, do not think that you can gather and resettle them in a small province, for there are too many - "in all (127) provinces of your kingdom").</p></div>
<div class="indent2"><span class="nm">9.</span><p>"Their laws are different from every nation" - they do not eat our food, and don't marry our women or our men.</p></div>
<div class="indent2"><span class="nm">10.</span><p>"They do not keep the king's laws" - all year they avoid work, saying 'Today is Shabbos, today is Pesach.'</p></div>
<div class="indent2"><span class="nm">11.</span><p>"It is not worth leaving them (alive)" - they eat and drink and despise the kingdom! If one of them found a fly in his wine, he removes the fly and drinks. If you would touch the cup, he would spill it on the ground and not drink it.</p></div>
<div class="indent1"><span class="nm">(d)</span><p><span class="cl">(Reish Lakish):</span> "(I will give) 10,000 talents of silver (to destroy them) - Hash-m knew that Haman would offer Shekalim to destroy Yisrael, therefore Hash-m commanded that we give Shekalim first (to redeem ourselves);</p></div>
<div class="indent2"><span class="nm">1.</span><p><span class="cl">(Mishnah):</span> On the first of Adar we announce about Shekalim...</p></div>
