<div class="indent2"><span class="nm">1.</span><p><span class="cl">Suggestion:</span> He erred (he thought that it is a different Korban).</p></div>
<div class="indent2"><span class="nm">2.</span><p>Rejection If so, our Mishnah would teach that a mistaken Akirah (changing to a different Korban) takes effect (this cannot be, for Amora'im argue about this (Menachos 49A)!)</p></div>
<div class="indent1"><span class="nm">(b)</span><p><span class="cl">Answer:</span> He was [intentionally] Oker [but he thought that this is permitted on Shabbos, therefore he brings a Chatas].</p></div>
<div class="indent1"><span class="nm">(c)</span><p><span class="cl">Question (Seifa):</span> If he slaughtered any other Korban l'Shem Pesach - if it was unfit for Pesach, he is Chayav; if it was fit for Pesach, R. Eliezer is Mechayev Chatas, and R. Yehoshua exempts.</p></div>
<div class="indent2"><span class="nm">1.</span><p>If he was Oker, in either case he is liable!</p></div>
<div class="indent1"><span class="nm">(d)</span><p><span class="cl">Answer:</span> In the Seifa he erred.</p></div>
<div class="indent1"><span class="nm">(e)</span><p><span class="cl">Question:</span> Does the Reisha discuss Oker, and the Seifa discusses a mistake?!</p></div>
<div class="indent1"><span class="nm">(f)</span><p><span class="cl">Answer (R. Avin):</span> Yes!</p></div>
<div class="indent1"><span class="nm">(g)</span><p>R. Yitzchak bar Yosef asked R. Avahu how we establish the Mishnah, and received this answer; R. Yitzchak learned this from him 40 times, until it was solidly ingrained in him.</p></div>
<div class="indent1"><span class="nm">(h)</span><p><span class="cl">Question (Mishnah - R. Eliezer):</span> One may slaughter Pesach Lishmah - nevertheless, if he slaughtered it l'Shem anything else he is Chayav - all the more so, he is liable for other Korbanos Lo Lishmah!</p></div>
<div class="indent2"><span class="nm">1.</span><p>If the Reisha discusses Oker and the Seifa discusses a mistake, we cannot learn from the Reisha!</p></div>
<div class="indent1"><span class="nm">(i)</span><p><span class="cl">Answer:</span> R. Eliezer does not distinguish Oker from a mistake; R. Yehoshua does.</p></div>
<div class="indent1"><span class="nm">(j)</span><p><span class="cl">Question:</span> R. Yehoshua should have answered that he distinguishes them!</p></div>
<div class="indent1"><span class="nm">(k)</span><p><span class="cl">Answer:</span> Indeed, he responds 'I distinguish - the Reisha discusses Oker and the Seifa discusses a mistake - even if you do not distinguish, you cannot learn from Pesach slaughtered l'Shem something forbidden to slaughtering other Korbanos l'Shem something permitted!'</p></div>
<div class="indent1"><span class="nm">(l)</span><p><span class="cl">(Mishnah - R. Eliezer):</span> Korbanos Tzibur disprove this - they are permitted Lishmah, yet if one slaughtered another Korban l'Shem them, he is liable!</p></div>
<div class="indent1"><span class="nm">(m)</span><p><span class="cl">R. Yehoshua:</span> Those are different, for there is a limit how many are offered, but everyone offers Pesach!</p></div>

<div class="indent1"><span class="nm">(a)</span><p><span class="cl">Question:</span> This implies that R. Yehoshua is Mechayev whenever there is a limit - but this is not true, e.g. regarding babies!</p></div>
<div class="indent2"><span class="nm">1.</span><p><span class="cl">(Mishnah):</span> If Reuven had two babies to circumcise, one on Shabbos and one the next day, and he mistakenly circumcised the latter on Shabbos, he is Chayav [Chatas - he erred about a Mitzvah and did not do a Mitzvah, for he circumcised too early];</p></div>
<div class="indent2"><span class="nm">2.</span><p>R. Eliezer says, if one baby should have been circumcised on Erev Shabbos and the other on Shabbos, and he mistakenly circumcised the former on Shabbos, he is liable;</p></div>

<div class="indent1"><span class="nm">(b)</span><p><span class="cl">Answer (R. Ami):</span> The case is, he circumcised the nine day old baby first - he was obsessed with a Mitzvah [that is Docheh Shabbos, i.e. the eight day baby, therefore he is exempt];</p></div>
<div class="indent2"><span class="nm">1.</span><p>Here, the Korbanos Tzibur were offered before he slaughtered [therefore he is liable].</p></div>

<div class="indent2"><span class="nm">2.</span><p><span class="cl">(Beraisa - R. Chiya of Evel Arev):</span> R. Meir taught that R. Eliezer and R. Yehoshua agree that if one mistakenly circumcised on Shabbos a nine day old instead of the eight day old, he is <i>liable</i>;</p></div>
<div class="indent2"><span class="nm">3.</span><p>They argue about one who mistakenly circumcised a seven day old instead of the eight day old - R. Eliezer is Mechayev, R. Yehoshua exempts.</p></div>

<div class="indent1"><span class="nm">(d)</span><p><span class="cl">Answer (D'vei R. Yanai):</span> The case [in the Reisha] is, he circumcised the baby due to be circumcised on Shabbos on Erev Shabbos - he had no Heter to circumcise on Shabbos;</p></div>
<div class="bbbline">72b----------------------------------------72b</p></div>
<div class="indent2"><span class="nm">1.</span><p>In the Seifa, he had a Heter to circumcise on Shabbos.</p></div>

<div class="indent1"><span class="nm">(e)</span><p><span class="cl">Question (Rav Ashi):</span> Also in the Reisha, there is a Heter to circumcise other eight day babies in the world!</p></div>
<div class="indent1"><span class="nm">(f)</span><p><span class="cl">Answer (Rav Kahana):</span> [They are not the responsibility of this man,] he has no Heter to override Shabbos.</p></div>
<div class="indent1"><span class="nm">(g)</span><p><span class="cl">(Mishnah):</span> If he slaughtered any other Korban l'Shem Pesach - if the animal was unfit for Pesach, he is Chayav;</p></div>

<div class="indent1"><span class="nm">(i)</span><p><span class="cl">Answer:</span> It is R. Shimon:</p></div>
<div class="indent2"><span class="nm">1.</span><p><span class="cl">(Beraisa - R. Meir):</span> [If one slaughtered another Korban l'Shem Pesach on Shabbos] he is exempt whether or not it is fitting;</p></div>

<div class="indent1"><span class="nm">(k)</span><p><span class="cl">Question (R. Zeira):</span> But R. Yochanan taught that R. Meir agrees about a Ba'al Mum [that he is liable]!</p></div>
<div class="indent1"><span class="nm">(l)</span><p><span class="cl">Answer (Rav Bivi):</span> One is not obsessed with a Ba'al Mum (it is Pasul for any Korban) - one is obsessed with a calf.</p></div>

<div class="indent1"><span class="nm">(o)</span><p><span class="cl">Question:</span> But R. Yochanan taught that R. Meir agrees about a Ba'al Mum!</p></div>
<div class="indent1"><span class="nm">(p)</span><p><span class="cl">Answer:</span> A Ba'al Mum cannot be confused [with a Kosher Pesach] - Chulin can be confused.</p></div>
<div class="indent1"><span class="nm">(q)</span><p><span class="cl">Question:</span> R. Meir's reason is not because it could be confused!</p></div>
<div class="indent2"><span class="nm">1.</span><p><span class="cl">(Rav Bivi):</span> R. Meir exempts even if a Shelamim calf was slaughtered l'Shem Pesach.</p></div>

<div class="indent1"><span class="nm">(r)</span><p><span class="cl">Answer:</span> R. Meir exempts one obsessed with a Mitzvah even if it cannot be confused, and also when one can get confused, even if he is not obsessed with a Mitzvah.</p></div>
<div class="subject"><span class="nm">3)</span><p>ONE WHO WANTED TO DO A MITZVAH AND ERRED (cont.)</p></div>
<div class="indent1"><span class="nm">(a)</span><p><span class="cl">(R. Zeira and R. Shmuel bar Rav Yitzchak):</span> Reish Lakish taught that if one mixed up a spit holding Nosar and a spit holding roasted meat [of permitted Kodshim] and ate the Nosar, he is liable;</p></div>
<div class="indent1"><span class="nm">(b)</span><p>R. Yochanan taught that if one had relations with his wife [and she was found to be] Nidah, he is liable; if one had relations with his Yevamah and she was Nidah, he is exempt.</p></div>
<div class="indent1"><span class="nm">(c)</span><p><span class="cl">Version #1:</span> All the more so, R. Yochanan would Mechayev regarding Nosar, for he did not do a Mitzvah;</p></div>
<div class="indent1"><span class="nm">(d)</span><p><span class="cl">Version #2:</span> R. Yochanan would exempt regarding Nosar.</p></div>
<div class="indent1"><span class="nm">(e)</span><p><span class="cl">Question:</span> What is the reason?</p></div>
<div class="indent1"><span class="nm">(f)</span><p><span class="cl">Answer:</span> He should have asked his wife [if she is Tehorah], but he did not need to ask regarding Nosar [he did not suspect that it might be Nosar].</p></div>
<div class="indent1"><span class="nm">(g)</span><p><span class="cl">Question:</span> Presumably, R. Yochanan exempts for a Yevamah because he did a Mitzvah - relations with one's wife is also a Mitzvah (Peru u'Rvu)!</p></div>
<div class="indent1"><span class="nm">(h)</span><p><span class="cl">Answer [#1]:</span> The case is, she was already pregnant.</p></div>
<div class="indent1"><span class="nm">(i)</span><p><span class="cl">Question:</span> Still, there is a Mitzvah of Onah (having relations with one's wife regularly - the frequency depends on one's occupation).</p></div>
<div class="indent1"><span class="nm">(j)</span><p><span class="cl">Answer:</span> The case is, it was not the time of Onah.</p></div>
<div class="indent1"><span class="nm">(k)</span><p><span class="cl">Question:</span> But Rava taught that one must have relations with his wife even not at the time of Onah [if he sees that she desires it - R. Yochanan did not distinguish]!</p></div>
<div class="indent1"><span class="nm">(l)</span><p><span class="cl">Answer [#2]:</span> The case is, it was just before her Veses (the time when she normally becomes Nidah - one must refrain from relations then. Rashba - this applies even during pregnancy, during the first three months; Rosh (Nidah 1:64) - Vestos do not apply during pregnancy - we retract from answer (h).)</p></div>
<div class="indent1"><span class="nm">(m)</span><p><span class="cl">Question:</span> If so, also his Yevamah was just before her Veses, so he should be liable!</p></div>
<div class="indent1"><span class="nm">(n)</span><p><span class="cl">Answer:</span> He is exempt because he is ashamed to ask her about this; one is not ashamed to ask his wife. (Surely, one must be concerned that his Yevamah is Nidah! Perhaps he knew that she was Tehorah from her clothing, or from her neighbors, or saw her engaging in Taharos, or asked her about this but not about her Veses.)</p></div>
<div class="subject"><span class="nm">4)</span><p>LIKE WHOM DOES R. YOCHANAN HOLD?</p></div>
<div class="indent1"><span class="nm">(a)</span><p><span class="cl">Question:</span> Like which Tana does R. Yochanan hold?</p></div>
<div class="indent1"><span class="nm">(b)</span><p><span class="cl">Answer #1:</span> He holds like R. Yosi:</p></div>
<div class="indent2"><span class="nm">1.</span><p><span class="cl">(Mishnah - R. Yosi):</span> If the first day of Sukos was on Shabbos and someone took a Lulav into Reshus ha'Rabim he is exempt, for he had permission (he was obsessed with the Mitzvah).</p></div>
<div class="indent1"><span class="nm">(c)</span><p><span class="cl">Rejection:</span> Perhaps R. Yosi exempts regarding Lulav because there is a limited time (it must be taken that day - but there is no rush to do Yibum)!</p></div>
<div class="indent1"><span class="nm">(d)</span><p><span class="cl">Answer #2:</span> He holds like R. Yehoshua, who exempts for slaughtering the wrong Korban for Korbanos Tzibur on Shabbos.</p></div>
<div class="indent1"><span class="nm">(e)</span><p><span class="cl">Rejection:</span> Perhaps there also he exempts because there is a limited time (the Korban must be brought that day)!</p></div>
<div class="indent1"><span class="nm">(f)</span><p><span class="cl">Answer #3:</span> He holds like R. Yehoshua, who exempts for circumcising the wrong baby on Shabbos.</p></div>
<div class="indent1"><span class="nm">(g)</span><p><span class="cl">Rejection:</span> Perhaps he exempts because there is a limited time (he is commanded to circumcise on day eight)!</p></div>
<div class="indent1"><span class="nm">(h)</span><p><span class="cl">Answer #4:</span> He holds like R. Yehoshua regarding Terumah:</p></div>
<div class="indent2"><span class="nm">1.</span><p><span class="cl">(Mishnah - R. Eliezer):</span> If a Kohen was eating Terumah, and found out that his mother was divorced or did Chalitzah (i.e. he is a Chalal, an invalid Kohen), he pays Keren v'Chomesh;</p></div>
<div class="indent2"><span class="nm">2.</span><p>R. Yehoshua exempts.</p></div>
<div class="indent1"><span class="nm">(i)</span><p><span class="cl">Rejection #1:</span> Perhaps the case is like Rav Bivi bar Abaye said:</p></div>
<div class="indent2"><span class="nm">1.</span><p><span class="cl">(Rav Bibi Bar Abaye):</span> The case is, it was [Chametz on] Erev Pesach - there is limited time to eat it.</p></div>
<div class="indent1"><span class="nm">(j)</span><p><span class="cl">Rejection #2:</span> Eating Terumah is called Avodah - b'Di'eved, Avodah of a Chalal is Kosher:</p></div>
<div class="indent2"><span class="nm">1.</span><p><span class="cl">(Mishnah):</span> If a Kohen was offering Korbanos, and it became known that he was a Chalal, what he offered is Pasul;</p></div>
<div class="indent2"><span class="nm">2.</span><p>R. Yehoshua is Machshir.</p></div>
<div class="indent2"><span class="nm">3.</span><p><span class="cl">Question:</span> What is R. Yehoshua's source?</p></div>
<div class="indent2"><span class="nm">4.</span><p><span class="cl">Answer:</span> "Barech Hash-m <i>Cheilo</i> u'Fo'al Yadav Tirtzeh" (even the Avodah of Chalalim is acceptable. The Gemara did not find a solid source for R. Yochanan.)</p></div>
<div class="indent1"><span class="nm">(k)</span><p><span class="cl">Question:</span> What is the source that eating Terumah is called Avodah?</p></div>
<div class="indent1"><span class="nm">(l)</span><p><span class="cl">Answer (Beraisa):</span> Once, R. Gamliel asked R. Tarfon why he wasn't in the Beis Medrash the previous night.</p></div>
<div class="indent1"><span class="nm">(m)</span><p><span class="cl">R. Tarfon:</span> I was doing Avodah.</p></div>
<div class="indent1"><span class="nm">(n)</span><p><span class="cl">Question (R. Gamliel):</span> What Avodah is there after the Churban?!</p></div>
<div class="indent1"><span class="nm">(o)</span><p><span class="cl">Answer (R. Tarfon):</span> "Avodas Matanah (gifts to a Kohen) Eten Es Kehunaschem veha'Zar ha'Karev Yumas" - eating Terumah outside the Mikdash is like Avodah in the Mikdash (if a Chalal ate, he was not Mechalel it).</p></div>
