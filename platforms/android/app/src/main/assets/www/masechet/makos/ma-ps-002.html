<p class="bas subject"><span class="nm">1)</span>WHEN WE CANNOT PUNISH <i>KA'ASHER ZAMAM</i></p>
<p class="bas indent1"><span class="nm">(a)</span><span class="cl">(Mishnah):</span> How are witnesses (punished when) found to be Zomemim (i.e. latter witnesses (Mezimim) testify 'at the time the first witnesses claimed to see the testimony, they were with us elsewhere')? (This question will be explained.)</p>
<p class="bas indent1"><span class="nm">(b)</span>If two witnesses testify that Ploni (a Kohen) is the son of a Gerushah (divorcee) or Chalutzah (which means that he is a Chalal (a disqualified Kohen), and they were Huzmu), the witness do not become Chalalim. Rather, each receives 40 lashes. (Whenever we say 40 lashes, it is really 39.)</p>
<p class="bas indent1"><span class="nm">(c)</span>If two witnesses testify that Ploni must be exiled (stay in an Ir Milkat (refuge city, i.e. Galus) until the Kohen Gadol dies, for killing someone b'Shogeg), and they were Huzmu, we do not exile the witnesses. Rather, each receives 40 lashes.</p>
<p class="bas indent1"><span class="nm">(d)</span><span class="cl">(Gemara) Question #1:</span> The Mishnah (discusses when we do not punish the witnesses "Ka'asher Zamam", i.e. with the same sentence they schemed to inflict on Ploni. It) should say 'how are witnesses <i>not</i> (punished when) found to be Zomemim?</p>
<p class="bas indent1"><span class="nm">(e)</span><span class="cl">Question #2:</span> A later Mishnah explicitly teaches how witnesses become Zomemim!</p>
<p class="bas indent2"><span class="nm">1.</span><span class="cl">(Mishnah):</span> If the latter witnesses said 'How can you testify about this? That day, you were with us in a different place', the former witnesses are Zomemim.</p>
<p class="bas indent1"><span class="nm">(f)</span><span class="cl">Answer:</span> Our Mishnah is a continuation of the last Mishnah of Sanhedrin (according to the Bavli, it is the last Mishnah of Perek 10), which says 'Edim Zomemim always receive the Misah they plotted to impose on the Nidon (the one being judged), except when they falsely testified about a Bas Kohen and her adulterer' (they are choked, even though she is burned);</p>
<p class="bas indent2"><span class="nm">1.</span>There are other Edim Zomemim who are not punished even close to Ka'asher Zamam, rather, they just receive 40 lashes;</p>
<p class="bas indent2"><span class="nm">2.</span>If witnesses testify that Ploni is a Ben Gerushah or Ben Chalutzah, we do not say that the witnesses become Chalalim. Rather, each receives 40 lashes.</p>
<p class="bas indent1"><span class="nm">(g)</span><span class="cl">Question:</span> What is the source of this?</p>
<p class="bas indent1"><span class="nm">(h)</span><span class="cl">Answer #1 (R. Yehoshua ben Levi):</span> "Va'Asisem <i>Lo</i> Ka'asher Zamam" - to him, and not to his descendants. (If the witness would become a Chalal, this would disqualify also his descendants.)</p>
<p class="bas indent2"><span class="nm">1.</span><span class="cl">Question:</span> We should say that he becomes a Chalal, but his children are Kesherim!</p>
<p class="bas indent2"><span class="nm">2.</span><span class="cl">Answer:</span> This is not "Ka'asher Zamam" (he plotted to disqualify Ploni <i>and</i> Ploni's descendants).</p>
<p class="bas indent1"><span class="nm">(i)</span><span class="cl">Answer #2 (Bar Pada):</span> A Kal va'Chomer teaches this. A Kohen who is Mechalel (he has Bi'ah with a Gerushah, which makes her a Chalalah) does not become a Chalal. One (i.e. an Ed Zomem) who tried to be Mechalel but failed, and all the more so he does not become a Chalal!</p>
<p class="bas indent1"><span class="nm">(j)</span><span class="cl">Rejection (Ravina):</span> If so, always (Rashi; Tosfos - often) we cannot kill Edim Zomemim!</p>
<p class="bas bbbline">2b----------------------------------------2b</p>
<p class="bas indent2"><span class="nm">1.</span><span class="cl">Version #1 - Rashi:</span> Edim Zomemim who stoned Ploni (through their testimony) are not stoned (they are exempt). All the more so, Edim Zomemim who tried to stone but failed (they were Huzmu before Ploni was executed) should not be stoned!</p>
<p class="bas indent2"><span class="nm">2.</span><span class="cl">Version #2 - Tosfos:</span> A murderer who stoned is not stoned (he is beheaded, which is more lenient). All the more so, Edim Zomemim who tried to stone but failed. should not be stoned!</p>
<p class="bas indent1"><span class="nm">(k)</span>We must rely on Answer #1.</p>
<p class="bas indent1"><span class="nm">(l)</span><span class="cl">(Mishnah):</span> If two witnesses testify that Ploni must be exiled...</p>
<p class="bas indent1"><span class="nm">(m)</span><span class="cl">Question:</span> What is the source of this?</p>
<p class="bas indent1"><span class="nm">(n)</span><span class="cl">Answer #1 (Reish Lakish):</span> "<i>Hu</i> (one who killed b'Shogeg) Yanus", but not Edim Zomemim.</p>
<p class="bas indent1"><span class="nm">(o)</span><span class="cl">Answer #2 (R. Yochanan):</span> A Kal va'Chomer teaches this. A murderer, who did an action, is not exiled if he was Mezid (even if he is not killed). Edim Zomemim did not do an action. All the more so they are not exiled even though they were Mezidim!</p>
<p class="bas indent1"><span class="nm">(p)</span><span class="cl">Objection:</span> There, the Kal va'Chomer does not apply due to the severity of the Aveirah!</p>
<p class="bas indent2"><span class="nm">1.</span>Because a murderer did an action, he is not exiled if he was Mezid, for he is not worthy of Kaparah (atonement). Edim Zomemim did not do an action, so even though they were Mezidim they should be exiled, in order to get Kaparah!</p>
<p class="bas indent1"><span class="nm">(q)</span>We must rely on Reish Lakish's answer.</p>
<p class="bas subject"><span class="nm">2)</span>EDIM ZOMEMIM ARE LASHED</p>
<p class="bas indent1"><span class="nm">(a)</span><span class="cl">Question (Ula):</span> Where does the Torah hint about Zomemim witnesses?</p>
<p class="bas indent1"><span class="nm">(b)</span><span class="cl">Objection:</span> The Torah explicitly discusses them - "Ka'asher Zamam"!</p>
<p class="bas indent1"><span class="nm">(c)</span><span class="cl">Correction:</span> Rather, where does the Torah hint that Zomemim witnesses are lashed (when we cannot punish them like they plotted, e.g. if they testified that Ploni is a Chalal)?</p>
<p class="bas indent1"><span class="nm">(d)</span><span class="cl">Answer:</span> "V'Hitzdiku Es ha'Tzadik v'Hirshi'u Es h'aRasha...";</p>
<p class="bas indent2"><span class="nm">1.</span><span class="cl">Question:</span> Acquitting the innocent is not a condition for (lashing the Rasha, the continuation of the verse) "v'Hayah Im Bin Hakos ha'Rasha"!</p>
<p class="bas indent2"><span class="nm">2.</span><span class="cl">Answer:</span> Rather, the case is that (Zomemim) witnesses caused a Tzadik to be convicted, and other witnesses (Mezimim) showed that he was truly a Tzadik and that the first witnesses were Resha'im. "V'Hayah Im Bin Hakos ha'Rasha" teaches that he is lashed.</p>
<p class="bas indent2"><span class="nm">3.</span><span class="cl">Question:</span> We should say that he is lashed due to "Lo Sa'aneh" (do not testify falsely)?</p>
<p class="bas indent2"><span class="nm">4.</span><span class="cl">Answer:</span> That is a Lav without an action. One is not lashed for such a Lav.</p>
<p class="bas subject"><span class="nm">3)</span>SPECIAL LAWS OF EDIM ZOMEMIM</p>
<p class="bas indent1"><span class="nm">(a)</span><span class="cl">(Beraisa):</span> These four laws apply to an Ed Zomem:</p>
<p class="bas indent2"><span class="nm">1.</span>He cannot become a Ben Gerushah or Ben Chalutzah;</p>
<p class="bas indent2"><span class="nm">2.</span>He cannot be exiled;</p>
<p class="bas indent2"><span class="nm">3.</span>He does not pay Kofer (ransom, e.g. he testified that Ploni is Chayav Kofer because his Mu'ad animal killed someone);</p>
<p class="bas indent2"><span class="nm">4.</span>He is not sold to be a slave.</p>
<p class="bas indent1"><span class="nm">(b)</span>R. Akiva adds, he need not pay based on his own admission.</p>
<p class="bas indent1"><span class="nm">(c)</span>Above, we gave the source for the first two laws;</p>
<p class="bas indent1"><span class="nm">(d)</span>The Tana exempts from Kofer. He holds that Kofer is a Kaparah (for one who did not guard his animal. This does not apply to Edim Zomemim, for their animal did not kill);</p>
<p class="bas indent2"><span class="nm">1.</span><span class="cl">Question:</span> Which Tana holds that Kofer is a Kaparah?</p>
<p class="bas indent2"><span class="nm">2.</span><span class="cl">Answer #1 (Rav Chisda):</span> It is R. Yishmael, son of R. Yochanan ben Brokah.</p>
<p class="bas indent3"><span class="nm">i.</span><span class="cl">(Beraisa):</span> "V'Nosan Pidyon Nafsho" (the animal's owner pays redemption of his soul)", i.e. the value of the victim;</p>
<p class="bas indent3"><span class="nm">ii.</span>R. Yishmael, son of R. Yochanan ben Brokah says, he pays his own value.</p>
<p class="bas indent3"><span class="nm">iii.</span><span class="cl">Suggestion:</span> Chachamim (the first Tana) hold that Kofer is money (compensation for the damage). R. Yishmael holds that it is Kaparah (to atone for the owner's negligence).</p>
<p class="bas indent2"><span class="nm">3.</span><span class="cl">Rejection (and Answer #2 - Rav Papa):</span> All agree that Kofer is a Kaparah. They argue about whose value is paid.</p>
<p class="bas indent2"><span class="nm">4.</span><span class="cl">Question:</span> What is Chachamim's reason?</p>
<p class="bas indent2"><span class="nm">5.</span><span class="cl">Answer:</span> It says 'Hashasah' (assessing) regarding compensation for a miscarriage caused by striking a woman, and also regarding Kofer. Just like there we evaluate the victim's value, also here.</p>
<p class="bas indent3"><span class="nm">i.</span>R. Yishmael disagrees, for it says "v'Nosan Pidyon Nafsho" (he redeems his own soul)!</p>
<p class="bas indent3"><span class="nm">ii.</span>Chachamim agree that he redeems his own soul, but to do so he pays the victim's value (we learn from 'Hashasah').</p>
<p class="bas indent1"><span class="nm">(e)</span><span class="cl">(Beraisa):</span> Edim Zomemim are not sold to be slaves.</p>
<p class="bas indent1"><span class="nm">(f)</span><span class="cl">(Rav Hamnuna):</span> This is only if (they testified that Ploni stole, and) Ploni has money (to pay for his theft, so he would not have been sold). If Ploni has no money, even if they have money, they are sold.</p>
<p class="bas indent1"><span class="nm">(g)</span><span class="cl">Objection:</span> The Zomemim should be able to say 'if Ploni had money, he would not have been sold. Likewise, since we have money, we are not sold!'</p>
<p class="bas indent1"><span class="nm">(h)</span><span class="cl">Correction (Rav Hamnuna):</span> Rather, if Ploni or the witnesses have money, the witnesses are not sold, but if neither of them have money, they are sold.</p>
<p class="bas indent1"><span class="nm">(i)</span><span class="cl">Rejection (Rava):</span> "V'Nimkar bi'Gnevaso (he is sold for his theft)", but not for his false testimony.</p>
<p class="bas indent1"><span class="nm">(j)</span><span class="cl">(Beraisa - R. Akiva):</span> He need not pay based on his own admission.</p>
<p class="bas indent1"><span class="nm">(k)</span><span class="cl">Question:</span> What is R. Akiva's reason?</p>
<p class="bas indent1"><span class="nm">(l)</span><span class="cl">Answer:</span> He holds that "Ka'asher Zamam" is a Kenas (fine). One does not pay Kenas based on his own admission.</p>
<p class="bas indent1"><span class="nm">(m)</span><span class="cl">Support #1 (Rabah):</span> It must be a Kenas. They did not do an action, yet they are killed.</p>
<p class="bas indent1"><span class="nm">(n)</span><span class="cl">Support #2 (Rav Nachman):</span> It must be a Kenas. The Nidon did not lose his money, yet they pay.</p>
