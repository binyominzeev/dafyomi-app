<p class="bas subject"><span class="nm">1)</span>ESHES ACHIV SHE'LO HAYAH B'OLAMO (cont.)</p>
<p class="bas indent1"><span class="nm">(a)</span><span class="cl">Suggestion:</span> Perhaps mid'Oraisa he can do Yibum with one and exempt the other. Mid'Rabanan this is forbidden, lest people say that the same applies to Yevamos who fall from different brothers.</p>
<p class="bas indent1"><span class="nm">(b)</span><span class="cl">Rejection:</span> R. Shimon's Halachah is because of the Ma'amar!</p>
<p class="bas indent2"><span class="nm">1.</span><span class="cl">(Beraisa - R. Shimon):</span> If a Ma'amar is like Yibum, he does Yibum with the widow of the second brother. If Ma'amar is not like Yibum, he does Yibum with the widow of the first brother!</p>
<p class="bas indent1"><span class="nm">(c)</span><span class="cl">Question (Abaye):</span> Don't you distinguish between Zikah when there is one Yavam, and when there are two?</p>
<p class="bas indent2"><span class="nm">1.</span>Perhaps R. Shimon says that Zikah is like Yibum only when there is only one Yavam!</p>
<p class="bas indent1"><span class="nm">(d)</span><span class="cl">Question:</span> R. Shimon does not make such a distinction!</p>
<p class="bas indent2"><span class="nm">1.</span><span class="cl">(Beraisa - R. Shimon):</span> The general rule is, if the brother was born before the Yibum, she does neither Chalitzah nor Yibum. If he was born after the Yibum, she does Chalitzah or Yibum.</p>
<p class="bas indent2"><span class="nm">2.</span><span class="cl">Suggestion:</span> There is one brother, and she is exempt (when the Yavam was born before the Yibum)!</p>
<p class="bas indent1"><span class="nm">(e)</span><span class="cl">Answer:</span> No there are two brothers.</p>
<p class="bas indent1"><span class="nm">(f)</span><span class="cl">Inference:</span> If there was only one brother, she would do Chalitzah or Yibum.</p>
<p class="bas indent1"><span class="nm">(g)</span><span class="cl">Question:</span> If so, why does R. Shimon teach that Yibum is permitted when the Yavam was born after the Yibum?  He should permit even when he was born before, when he is the only brother!</p>
<p class="bas indent1"><span class="nm">(h)</span><span class="cl">Answer:</span> The entire Beraisa discusses two Yavamim.</p>
<p class="bas indent1"><span class="nm">(i)</span><span class="cl">Question #1:</span> If so, this is not a general rule!</p>
<p class="bas indent1"><span class="nm">(j)</span><span class="cl">Question #2 (Rav Oshaya - Mishnah):</span> If two of three brothers were married to sisters, or a woman and her daughter, or a woman and her daughter's daughter, or a woman and her son's daughter (and these two brothers died), the widows do Chalitzah, not Yibum;</p>
<p class="bas indent2"><span class="nm">1.</span>R. Shimon exempts.</p>
<p class="bas indent2"><span class="nm">2.</span>If R. Shimon holds that Zikah is like Yibum, he may do Yibum with one and exempt the other!</p>
<p class="bas indent1"><span class="nm">(k)</span><span class="cl">Answer (Rav Amram):</span> True! R. Shimon exempts only the second.</p>
<p class="bas indent1"><span class="nm">(l)</span><span class="cl">Objection (Beraisa - R. Shimon):</span> Both are exempt.</p>
<p class="bas indent1"><span class="nm">(m)</span><span class="cl">Answer #1 (Rava):</span> The second widow in each pair is exempt.</p>
<p class="bas indent1"><span class="nm">(n)</span>Rava misunderstood the Beraisa of four pairs.</p>
<p class="bas indent2"><span class="nm">1.</span><span class="cl">Mistake #1:</span> Each brother had only one wife (not four). The two wives were related in one of the four ways.</p>
<p class="bas indent2"><span class="nm">2.</span><span class="cl">Mistake #2:</span> According to Rava, it should have said that R. Shimon exempts all four.</p>
<p class="bas indent2"><span class="nm">3.</span><span class="cl">Mistake #3:</span> A Beraisa teaches that R. Shimon exempts them because of "Do not take to be Tzaros" - when (sisters) are Tzaros to each other (through Zikah), you cannot marry either.</p>
<p class="bas indent1"><span class="nm">(o)</span><span class="cl">Answer #2 (Rav Ashi):</span> If they fell to Yibum at different times, one could do Yibum with one and exempt the other;</p>
<p class="bas indent1"><span class="nm">(p)</span>The case is, they fell to Yibum simultaneously.</p>
<p class="bas indent1"><span class="nm">(q)</span>R. Shimon holds like R. Yosi ha'Galili, who says that it is possible for two events (e.g. deaths) to occur at the exact same time.</p>
<p class="bas subject"><span class="nm">2)</span>R. SHIMON SOMETIMES ADMITS</p>
<p class="bas indent1"><span class="nm">(a)</span><span class="cl">(Rav Papa):</span> R. Shimon argues only when the brother is born after Yibum. R. Shimon agrees that if he was born before, she is exempt.</p>
<p class="bas indent2"><span class="nm">1.</span>Both Mishnayos are needed to teach the opinion of Chachamim. The second Mishnah teaches more than the first.</p>
<p class="bas indent1"><span class="nm">(b)</span>A Beraisa supports Rav Papa and refutes Rav Oshaya.</p>
<p class="bas indent1"><span class="nm">(c)</span><span class="cl">(Beraisa):</span> Reuven died, leaving a brother Shimon. Levi (another brother) was born before Shimon had a chance to give a Ma'amar, then Shimon died;</p>
<p class="bas indent2"><span class="nm">1.</span>The first widow (Reuven's) is exempt due to Eshes Achiv she'Lo Hayah b'Olamo. The second (Shimon's other wife) does Chalitzah or Yibum;</p>
<p class="bas indent2"><span class="nm">2.</span>If Shimon gave a Ma'amar before or after Levi was born and then Shimon died, the first widow is exempt due to Eshes Achiv she'Lo Hayah b'Olamo. The second does Chalitzah, but not Yibum;</p>
<p class="bas bbbline">19b----------------------------------------19b</p>
<p class="bas indent2"><span class="nm">3.</span>R. Shimon says, Yibum or Chalitzah with one woman (i.e. the one who did not receive the Ma'amar) exempts her Tzarah.</p>
<p class="bas indent3"><span class="nm">i.</span>If Ba'alas ha'Ma'amar (the woman that received the Ma'amar) does Chalitzah, her Tzarah is not exempted.</p>
<p class="bas indent2"><span class="nm">4.</span>R. Meir says, if Shimon did Yibum and died, and then Levi was born, both women are exempt from Chalitzah and Yibum. The same applies if Levi was born and then Shimon did Yibum and died;</p>
<p class="bas indent2"><span class="nm">5.</span>R. Shimon says, since he (Levi) entered the world when she (the first widow) was permitted, and she was never forbidden to him [while awaiting Yibum], he may do Yibum or Chalitzah with either one.</p>
<p class="bas indent1"><span class="nm">(d)</span><span class="cl">Question:</span> Why was the last clause taught?</p>
<p class="bas indent2"><span class="nm">1.</span><span class="cl">Suggestion:</span> It teaches about R. Meir's opinion.</p>
<p class="bas indent2"><span class="nm">2.</span><span class="cl">Rejection:</span> R. Meir does not distinguish whether Levi was born before or after Yibum. Both cases should have been taught together!</p>
<p class="bas indent1"><span class="nm">(e)</span><span class="cl">Answer:</span> Rather, it teaches about R. Shimon's opinion.</p>
<p class="bas indent2"><span class="nm">1.</span>This shows that R. Shimon argues only when the Yibum preceded the birth, but admits when the birth preceded the Yibum.</p>
<p class="bas subject"><span class="nm">3)</span>MA'AMAR</p>
<p class="bas indent1"><span class="nm">(a)</span><span class="cl">(Beraisa):</span> If Shimon was going to give a Ma'amar, and a brother was born before he did, and Shimon died, the first widow is exempt due to Eshes Achiv she'Lo Hayah b'Olamo. The second does Chalitzah or Yibum.</p>
<p class="bas indent1"><span class="nm">(b)</span><span class="cl">Question:</span> What does it mean- "he was going to give a Ma'amar, but did not"? It matters whether or not he gave it, but not his intent to give it!</p>
<p class="bas indent1"><span class="nm">(c)</span><span class="cl">Answer:</span> He wanted to give it with her consent, but was not able, and gave it against her will. This is unlike Rebbi:</p>
<p class="bas indent2"><span class="nm">1.</span><span class="cl">(Beraisa - Rebbi):</span> A Ma'amar given against the will of the Yevamah is valid;</p>
<p class="bas indent2"><span class="nm">2.</span>Chachamim say that it is invalid.</p>
<p class="bas indent1"><span class="nm">(d)</span>Rebbi learns about Ma'amar from Yibum. Just like Yibum works against her will, also Ma'amar.</p>
<p class="bas indent2"><span class="nm">1.</span>Chachamim learn from regular Kidushin, which requires her consent.</p>
<p class="bas indent2"><span class="nm">2.</span>Rebbi says that it is better to learn matters of a Yevamah from matters of a Yevamah. Chachamim say that it is better to learn Kidushin from Kidushin.</p>
<p class="bas indent1"><span class="nm">(e)</span><span class="cl">(Beraisa):</span> If Shimon gave a Ma'amar before or after Levi was born, and died, the first widow is exempt due to Eshes Achiv she'Lo Hayah b'Olamo. The second does Chalitzah, but not Yibum;</p>
<p class="bas indent1"><span class="nm">(f)</span>R. Shimon says, Yibum or Chalitzah with one woman exempts her Tzarah.</p>
<p class="bas indent1"><span class="nm">(g)</span><span class="cl">Question:</span> Which case does R. Shimon discuss?</p>
<p class="bas indent2"><span class="nm">1.</span><span class="cl">Suggestion:</span> He discusses when the Ma'amar was given after the birth.</p>
<p class="bas indent2"><span class="nm">2.</span><span class="cl">Rejection:</span> We proved that R. Shimon admits when the birth precedes Yibum!</p>
<p class="bas indent1"><span class="nm">(h)</span><span class="cl">Answer:</span> He discusses when the Ma'amar preceded the birth.</p>
<p class="bas indent1"><span class="nm">(i)</span><span class="cl">(Beraisa):</span> If he does Chalitzah to Ba'alas ha'Ma'amar, her Tzarah is not exempted.</p>
<p class="bas indent1"><span class="nm">(j)</span>This is because the Tzarah definitely fell to Yibum to Levi, but Ba'alas ha'Ma'amar is Safek (if Ma'amar is not like Yibum, she is Eshes Achiv she'Lo Hayah b'Olamo). A Safek Chalitzah cannot exempt a Vadai Yevamah.</p>
<p class="bas subject"><span class="nm">4)</span>CHACHAMIM'S REASON</p>
<p class="bas indent1"><span class="nm">(a)</span><span class="cl">Question (Rav Menasheh bar Zvid):</span> What is R. Shimon's reason?</p>
<p class="bas indent1"><span class="nm">(b)</span><span class="cl">Objection:</span> The Beraisa explicitly says, because she was permitted from the day he was born!</p>
<p class="bas indent1"><span class="nm">(c)</span><span class="cl">Correction:</span> Rather, what is Chachamim's reason?</p>
<p class="bas indent1"><span class="nm">(d)</span><span class="cl">Answer:</span> "u'Lekachah Lo l'Ishah v'Yibmah" - she still is considered a Yevamah from her first husband.</p>
