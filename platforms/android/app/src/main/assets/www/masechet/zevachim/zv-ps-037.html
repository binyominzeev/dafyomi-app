<div class="indent1"><span class="nm">(a)</span><p><span class="cl">Question:</span> This verse teaches something else!</p></div>
<div class="indent2"><span class="nm">1.</span><p><span class="cl">(Beraisa) Question:</span> What is the source that leftover blood of all Korbanos is poured on the Yesod?</p></div>
<div class="indent2"><span class="nm">2.</span><p><span class="cl">Answer:</span> "V'Dam Zevachecha Yishafech".</p></div>
<div class="indent1"><span class="nm">(b)</span><p><span class="cl">Answer:</span> Our Tana (i.e. of Beraisa #1) learns that like Rebbi does.</p></div>
<div class="indent2"><span class="nm">1.</span><p><span class="cl">(Beraisa - Rebbi):</span> The Torah explicitly taught that extra blood of a Chatas is poured on the Yesod;</p></div>
<div class="indent2"><span class="nm">2.</span><p><span class="cl">Question:</span> What is the source regarding other Korbanos?</p></div>
<div class="indent2"><span class="nm">3.</span><p><span class="cl">Answer:</span> "Veha'Nish'ar <i>ba'Dam</i> Yimatzei".</p></div>
<div class="indent1"><span class="nm">(c)</span><p><span class="cl">Question:</span> Still, "v'Dam Zevachecha..." teaches something else!</p></div>
<div class="indent2"><span class="nm">1.</span><p><span class="cl">(Beraisa):</span> Question: What is the source that Shefichas (pouring) blood on the Mizbe'ach is Mechaper, even when the Torah said to be Zorek (throw) it?</p></div>
<div class="indent2"><span class="nm">2.</span><p><span class="cl">Answer:</span> "V'Dam Zevachecha Yishafech".</p></div>
<div class="indent1"><span class="nm">(d)</span><p><span class="cl">Answer:</span> Our Tana holds like R. Akiva, who says that pouring is not considered Zerikah, and Zerikah is not considered pouring.</p></div>
<div class="indent2"><span class="nm">1.</span><p><span class="cl">(Mishnah - R. Yishmael):</span> If one blessed for the Mitzvah of eating Korban Pesach, he need not bless for eating the Zevach (a Shelamim eaten with Pesach). If he blessed for the Zevach, he must bless also for the Pesach.</p></div>
<div class="indent3"><span class="nm">i.</span><p>(We are thinking that this is because the Torah requires Shefichah for Pesach, and Shefichah is valid for Shelamim, regarding which it says Zerikah, but Zerikah is not valid for Pesach.)</p></div>
<div class="indent2"><span class="nm">2.</span><p>R. Akiva says, neither Berachah exempts the other Korban.</p></div>
<div class="indent1"><span class="nm">(e)</span><p><span class="cl">Question:</span> Still, "v'Dam..." teaches something else!</p></div>
<div class="indent2"><span class="nm">1.</span><p><span class="cl">(Beraisa #2 - R. Yishmael):</span> "Ach Bechor Shor (...Damam Tizrok...)" teaches that one must put the blood and Eimurim of a Bechor on the Mizbe'ach;</p></div>
<div class="indent3"><span class="nm">i.</span><p><span class="cl">Question:</span> What is the source for Ma'aser (Behemah) and Pesach?</p></div>
<div class="indent3"><span class="nm">ii.</span><p><span class="cl">Answer:</span> "V'Dam Zevachecha Yishafech."</p></div>
<div class="indent1"><span class="nm">(f)</span><p><span class="cl">Answer:</span> Our Tana holds like R. Yosi ha'Galili, who learns this from a different verse.</p></div>
<div class="indent2"><span class="nm">1.</span><p><span class="cl">(Beraisa - R. Yosi ha'Galili):</span> It does not say 'Damo' and 'Chelbo', rather, "Damam" and "Chelbam" (plural, <i>their</i> blood and Chelev). This teaches that the blood and Eimurim of Ma'aser and Pesach is put on the Mizbe'ach.</p></div>
<div class="indent1"><span class="nm">(g)</span><p><span class="cl">Question:</span> In Beraisa #2, R. Yishmael used "v'Dam Zevachecha..." to teach about Ma'aser and Pesach. In the Mishnah, he (presumably) uses it to teach that pouring is considered Zerikah!</p></div>
<div class="indent1"><span class="nm">(h)</span><p><span class="cl">Answer:</span> The Tana'im of the Mishnah and Beraisa argue about his opinion.</p></div>
<div class="indent1"><span class="nm">(i)</span><p><span class="cl">Question:</span> R. Yishmael says (in Beraisa #2) that "Ach Bechor..." teaches only about Bechor. If so, we understand the next verse, "u'Vesaram Yihyeh Lach " (they are given to Kohanim);</p></div>
<div class="indent2"><span class="nm">1.</span><p>However, R. Yosi says that the verse alludes also to Ma'aser and Pesach. The owners eat them!</p></div>
<div class="indent1"><span class="nm">(j)</span><p><span class="cl">Answer:</span> R. Yosi explains that the plural ("u'Vesar<i>am</i>") teaches that Bechor is given to a Kohen whether it is Tam or Ba'al Mum;</p></div>
<div class="bbbline">37b----------------------------------------37b</p></div>
<div class="indent2"><span class="nm">1.</span><p>We have no other source for this (Rashi; Tosfos - we never find that a Ba'al Mum is given to a Kohen).</p></div>
<div class="indent2"><span class="nm">2.</span><p>R. Yishmael learns this from the end of the verse "Lecha Yihyeh."</p></div>
<div class="indent1"><span class="nm">(k)</span><p>R. Yosi says that the verse applies also to Ma'aser and Pesach, so "Lo Sifdeh Kodesh Hem" teaches that they are offered, but Temuros of them are not.</p></div>
<div class="indent2"><span class="nm">1.</span><p><span class="cl">(Mishnah):</span> Temurah of a Bechor or Ma'aser, or descendants of one of these (for any number of generations) is like Bechor and Ma'aser. The owner eats it like Chulin after it gets a Mum;</p></div>
<div class="indent2"><span class="nm">2.</span><p><span class="cl">(Mishnah - R. Yehoshua):</span> Sometimes Temurah of a Pesach is offered, and sometimes it is not. I do not know when it is offered.</p></div>
<div class="indent1"><span class="nm">(l)</span><p><span class="cl">Question:</span> R. Yishmael says that the verse discusses only Bechor. What is his source that Temuros of Ma'aser and Pesach are not offered?</p></div>
<div class="indent1"><span class="nm">(m)</span><p><span class="cl">Answer - part 1:</span> He learns Ma'aser from a Gezerah Shavah "Avarah-Avarah" from Bechor;</p></div>
<div class="indent1"><span class="nm">(n)</span><p><span class="cl">Answer - part 2:</span> Verses teach about Pesach;</p></div>
<div class="indent2"><span class="nm">1.</span><p>"Im Kesev" includes Temuras Pesach. It is offered for a Shelamim after Pesach.</p></div>
<div class="indent2"><span class="nm">2.</span><p><span class="cl">Suggestion:</span> Perhaps it is offered even before Pesach!</p></div>
<div class="indent2"><span class="nm">3.</span><p><span class="cl">Rejection:</span> "Hu" (teaches that Pesach is offered, but its Temurah is not).</p></div>
<div class="indent1"><span class="nm">(o)</span><p>Several Tana'im expounded "v'Dam Zevachecha..." differently. What is their source that one Zerikah of blood on the Mizbe'ach is Mechaper?</p></div>
<div class="indent1"><span class="nm">(p)</span><p><span class="cl">Answer:</span> They hold like Beis Hillel, who say that one Zerikah suffices for Chatas (like we will learn soon), and learn other Korbanos from Chatas.</p></div>
<div class="subject"><span class="nm">2)</span><p>EXPOUNDING <i>MIKRA</i> AND <i>MASORES</i></p></div>
<div class="indent1"><span class="nm">(a)</span><p><span class="cl">(Mishnah - Beis Shamai):</span> Two Zerikos of the blood of a Chatas are Mechaper.</p></div>
<div class="indent1"><span class="nm">(b)</span><p><span class="cl">(Rav Huna):</span> Beis Shamai learn from the three times it says (to put blood on the) "Keranos" (top corners of the Mizbe'ach);</p></div>
<div class="indent2"><span class="nm">1.</span><p>Each is pronounced Keranos (plural, teaching two), making a total of six;</p></div>
<div class="indent2"><span class="nm">2.</span><p>There are only four Keranos. The extra two teach that two Zerikos are Me'akev.</p></div>
<div class="indent1"><span class="nm">(c)</span><p><span class="cl">Question:</span> What is Beis Hillel's reason?</p></div>
<div class="indent1"><span class="nm">(d)</span><p><span class="cl">Answer #1:</span> Beis Hillel expound Mesores (according to the way words are written). Two of the three 'Keranos' are written without a 'Vov', suggesting Karnas (singular), therefore, the total is four;</p></div>
<div class="indent2"><span class="nm">1.</span><p>One Zerikah is Me'akev, and the other three are l'Chatchilah.</p></div>
<div class="indent2"><span class="nm">2.</span><p><span class="cl">Suggestion:</span> Perhaps all four are only l'Chatchilah?</p></div>
<div class="indent2"><span class="nm">3.</span><p><span class="cl">Rejection:</span> We never find that a Korban is acceptable without any Zerikah.</p></div>
<div class="indent1"><span class="nm">(e)</span><p><span class="cl">Answer #2:</span> Beis Hillel consider both Mesores and Mikra (the way words are pronounced);</p></div>
<div class="indent2"><span class="nm">1.</span><p>We do not learn only four, for the Mikra suggests six;</p></div>
<div class="indent2"><span class="nm">2.</span><p>We do not learn six, for the Mesores suggests only four;</p></div>
<div class="indent2"><span class="nm">3.</span><p>(We consider it as if five are written. There are only four Keranos, so the extra one teaches that one Zerikah is Me'akev.)</p></div>
<div class="indent1"><span class="nm">(f)</span><p><span class="cl">Question:</span> If so, Beis Hillel should expound "Totafos (Tefilin)" similarly. Two are written without a 'Vov', and one with a Vov;</p></div>
<div class="indent2"><span class="nm">1.</span><p>They should require five compartments in the head Tefilin!</p></div>
<div class="indent1"><span class="nm">(g)</span><p><span class="cl">Answer:</span> They hold like R. Akiva, who says that the word itself means four:</p></div>
<div class="indent2"><span class="nm">1.</span><p>'Tat' means two in Katfi (a language). 'Fos' means two in Afriki.</p></div>
<div class="indent1"><span class="nm">(h)</span><p><span class="cl">Question:</span> Beis Hillel should expound "Sukos" similarly. Two are written without a 'Vov', and one with a Vov;</p></div>
<div class="indent2"><span class="nm">1.</span><p>They should require five walls in a Sukah!</p></div>
