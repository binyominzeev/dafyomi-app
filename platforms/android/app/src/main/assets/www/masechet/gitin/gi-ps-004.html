<p class="bas subject"><span class="nm">1)</span>WHO IS THE <i>TANA</i> OF THE MISHNAH (cont.)?</p>
<p class="bas indent1"><span class="nm">(a)</span><span class="cl">Suggestion:</span> Perhaps R. Meir said only that if he told witnesses to sign it and gave it to his wife, mid'Oraisa it is valid (but mid'Rabanan it is not).</p>
<p class="bas indent1"><span class="nm">(b)</span><span class="cl">Rejection:</span> If so, R. Meir should have said "mid'Oraisa it is valid."</p>
<p class="bas indent1"><span class="nm">(c)</span><span class="cl">Answer #2:</span> Really, the Mishnah is like R. Elazar. He holds that a Get without signatures is Kosher, but if it has signatures, they must be Lishmah;</p>
<p class="bas indent2"><span class="nm">1.</span><span class="cl">(R. Aba):</span> R. Elazar agrees that an intrinsic forgery (a signed document in which it appears that we may rely on the witnesses' signatures, but in truth they are invalid) is Pasul (even if witnesses saw the document handed over).</p>
<p class="bas indent1"><span class="nm">(d)</span><span class="cl">Answer #3 (Rav Ashi):</span> The Mishnah is like R. Yehudah;</p>
<p class="bas indent2"><span class="nm">1.</span><span class="cl">(Mishnah - R. Yehudah):</span> The Get is Pasul unless it was both written and signed when detached.</p>
<p class="bas indent1"><span class="nm">(e)</span><span class="cl">Question:</span> Why didn't we establish the Mishnah like R. Yehudah from the beginning?</p>
<p class="bas indent1"><span class="nm">(f)</span><span class="cl">Answer:</span> We sought to establish it like R. Meir, for we assume that an anonymous Mishnah is R. Meir. We sought to establish it is like R. Elazar, for the Halachah follows R. Elazar regarding Gitin.</p>
<p class="bas subject"><span class="nm">2)</span>THE OUTSKIRTS OF ERETZ YISRAEL</p>
<p class="bas indent1"><span class="nm">(a)</span><span class="cl">(Mishnah - R. Gamliel):</span> He must say this even if he brings it from Rekem or Cheger. R. Eliezer obligates even if he brings it from the village near Lud to Lud;</p>
<p class="bas indent1"><span class="nm">(b)</span><span class="cl">(Abaye):</span> The Tana'im argue about cities that are close to Eretz Yisrael and enveloped (surrounded on three sides by Eretz Yisrael);</p>
<p class="bas indent2"><span class="nm">1.</span><span class="cl">(Rabah bar bar Chanah):</span> These cities are as far from Eretz Yisrael as from Bei Kuvi to Pumbadisa.</p>
<p class="bas indent1"><span class="nm">(c)</span>The first Tana does not require a Shali'ach from such cities to make the declaration.</p>
<p class="bas indent1"><span class="nm">(d)</span><span class="cl">Suggestion:</span> The first Tana holds like Rabah. The nearby cities also know the law of Lishmah, so no declaration is needed. The latter Tana'im hold like Rava. Since witnesses are not available for Kiyum, they require a declaration.</p>
<p class="bas indent1"><span class="nm">(e)</span><span class="cl">Rejection:</span> No. Rabah can explain that all the Tana'im hold like him, and Rava can do similarly;</p>
<p class="bas indent2"><span class="nm">1.</span><span class="cl">(On behalf of Rabah):</span> The first Tana holds that nearby cities know the law of Lishmah. R. Gamliel says, only enveloped cities know. R. Eliezer says, even though enveloped cities know, also they must say the declaration, to make the law uniform in Chutz La'aretz.</p>
<p class="bas indent2"><span class="nm">2.</span><span class="cl">(Rava):</span> The first Tana holds that witnesses are available to be Mekayem signatures from nearby cities. R. Gamliel holds that witnesses are available only from enveloped cities. R. Eliezer obligates even from enveloped cities, to make the law uniform in Chutz La'aretz.</p>
<p class="bas subject"><span class="nm">3)</span>WHY THE <i>TANA'IM</i> IN THE MISHNAH REQUIRE THE DECLARATION</p>
<p class="bas indent1"><span class="nm">(a)</span><span class="cl">(Mishnah - Chachamim):</span> One who brings a Get from abroad, or takes a Get abroad, must say...</p>
<p class="bas indent1"><span class="nm">(b)</span><span class="cl">Inference:</span> The first Tana exempts one who takes a Get abroad from the declaration.</p>
<p class="bas indent1"><span class="nm">(c)</span><span class="cl">Suggestion:</span> The first Tana holds like Rabah. Since the Get was written in Eretz Yisrael, where people know about Lishmah, no declaration is needed. The latter Chachamim hold like Rava. Since witnesses are not available to be Mekayem the signatures, a declaration is required.</p>
<p class="bas bbbline">4b----------------------------------------4b</p>
<p class="bas indent1"><span class="nm">(d)</span><span class="cl">Rejection:</span> No. Rabah can explain that all the Tana'im learn like he does, and so can Rava:</p>
<p class="bas indent2"><span class="nm">1.</span><span class="cl">(On behalf of Rabah):</span> All hold that there is no concern about the Get. The latter Chachamim decree to require a declaration lest a Shali'ach with a Get from abroad not say it. The first Tana does not decree.</p>
<p class="bas indent2"><span class="nm">2.</span><span class="cl">(On behalf of Rava):</span> There is no argument. The latter Chachamim explain that the first Tana also requires a declaration for a Get sent abroad.</p>
<p class="bas indent1"><span class="nm">(e)</span><span class="cl">(Mishnah):</span> One who brings a Get from one province to another in Chutz La'aretz must say 'it was written...'</p>
<p class="bas indent1"><span class="nm">(f)</span><span class="cl">Version #1 - Inference:</span> Within the same province in Chutz La'aretz, no declaration is needed.</p>
<p class="bas indent1"><span class="nm">(g)</span><span class="cl">Question:</span> This is like Rava, who says that the concern is Kiyum;</p>
<p class="bas indent2"><span class="nm">1.</span>According to Rabah, we should be concerned that it was not Lishmah!</p>
<p class="bas indent1"><span class="nm">(h)</span><span class="cl">Answer:</span> Rather, we infer that no declaration is needed from province to province in Eretz Yisrael.</p>
<p class="bas indent1"><span class="nm">(i)</span><span class="cl">Objection:</span> The Reisha explicitly taught this!</p>
<p class="bas indent1"><span class="nm">(j)</span><span class="cl">Answer:</span> If we learned only from the Reisha, one might have thought that b'Di'eved, the Get is Kosher, but l'Chatchilah, a declaration must be made. The repetition teaches that even l'Chatchilah, no declaration is needed.</p>
<p class="bas indent1"><span class="nm">(k)</span><span class="cl">Version #2 - Inference:</span> From province to province in Eretz Yisrael, no declaration is needed.</p>
<p class="bas indent1"><span class="nm">(l)</span><span class="cl">Question:</span> This is like Rabah, who says that the concern is Lishmah;</p>
<p class="bas indent2"><span class="nm">1.</span>According to Rava, we should be concerned that witnesses are not available to be Mekayem the signatures!</p>
<p class="bas indent1"><span class="nm">(m)</span><span class="cl">Answer #1:</span> Rather, we infer that within the same province in Chutz La'aretz, no declaration is needed.</p>
<p class="bas indent1"><span class="nm">(n)</span><span class="cl">Objection:</span> If a declaration is needed (even in Eretz Yisrael) from province to province, the Mishnah should simply say so (without mentioning Chutz la'Aretz)!</p>
<p class="bas indent1"><span class="nm">(o)</span><span class="cl">Answer #2:</span> Really, from province to province in Eretz Yisrael, no declaration is needed. Since all ascend to Yerushalayim on the festivals, witnesses can be found to be Mekayem the signatures.</p>
<p class="bas indent1"><span class="nm">(p)</span><span class="cl">Question:</span> This applies only when the Mikdash stands. How can we answer for after the Churban?</p>
<p class="bas indent1"><span class="nm">(q)</span><span class="cl">Answer:</span> Since Batei Dinin are fixed, people regularly travel from province to province, and witnesses are available for Kiyum.</p>
<p class="bas subject"><span class="nm">4)</span>RABAH AGREES WITH RAVA'S REASON</p>
<p class="bas indent1"><span class="nm">(a)</span><span class="cl">(Mishnah - R. Shimon ben Gamliel):</span> Even from one county to another (he must say...)</p>
<p class="bas indent1"><span class="nm">(b)</span><span class="cl">(R. Yitzchak):</span> Asasiyos was a city in Eretz Yisrael. It had two districts, each ruled by a different governor. They would not let people travel between the districts, so a declaration was required for a Get sent from one district to the other.</p>
<p class="bas indent1"><span class="nm">(c)</span><span class="cl">Question:</span> This is like Rava, but it is unlike Rabah!</p>
<p class="bas indent1"><span class="nm">(d)</span><span class="cl">Answer:</span> Rabah agrees that we are concerned for Kiyum. He says that we are also concerned for Lishmah.</p>
<p class="bas indent1"><span class="nm">(e)</span><span class="cl">Question:</span> If so, (Rabah and Rava do not argue in all the cases listed above (2b);) in which cases do Rabah and Rava argue?</p>
<p class="bas indent1"><span class="nm">(f)</span><span class="cl">Answer:</span> They argue about two Sheluchim who bring a Get, and a Get brought within one province in Chutz La'aretz. (Only Rabah requires a declaration.)</p>
