<p class="bas subject"><span class="nm">1)</span>CARE FOR <i>KELIM</i></p>
<p class="bas indent1"><span class="nm">(a)</span><span class="cl">(Mishnah):</span> He spreads it out for its upkeep, but not for his own honor.</p>
<p class="bas indent1"><span class="nm">(b)</span><span class="cl">Question:</span> May he spread it out for its upkeep and for his own honor?</p>
<p class="bas indent1"><span class="nm">(c)</span><span class="cl">Answer #1 (Mishnah):</span> He spreads it out for its upkeep.</p>
<p class="bas indent2"><span class="nm">1.</span><span class="cl">Inference:</span> For its upkeep and his own honor are forbidden.</p>
<p class="bas indent2"><span class="nm">2.</span><span class="cl">Question (Reisha):</span> He may not spread it out for his own honor.</p>
<p class="bas indent3"><span class="nm">i.</span><span class="cl">Inference:</span> For its upkeep and for his own honor is permitted!</p>
<p class="bas indent2"><span class="nm">3.</span><span class="cl">Conclusion:</span> The inferences contradict one another. We cannot determine which is correct. The Mishnah is not a proof either way.</p>
<p class="bas indent1"><span class="nm">(d)</span><span class="cl">Answer #2 (Beraisa):</span> He may not spread it on a bed, nor on a peg for his needs. If guests came, he may not do this for his needs and its sake together.</p>
<p class="bas indent1"><span class="nm">(e)</span>Rejection There is different, for it will be ruined, either due to Ayin ha'Ra (envy), or lest it be stolen.</p>
<p class="bas indent1"><span class="nm">(f)</span><span class="cl">Answer #3 (Beraisa):</span> If a calf was brought to a team of yoked animals, and it threshed, (this is not considered that the owner worked with it, so) it is not disqualified from being an Eglah Arufah (a calf beheaded for atonement when a murdered body is found);</p>
<p class="bas indent2"><span class="nm">1.</span>If it was brought in so it will nurse and thresh, it is disqualified.</p>
<p class="bas indent2"><span class="nm">2.</span>This teaches that intent for its <i>and</i> the owner's benefit is like intent for the owner's benefit alone!</p>
<p class="bas indent1"><span class="nm">(g)</span><span class="cl">Rejection #1:</span> Eglah Arufah is different. It says "Asher Lo Uvad Bah (work was not done with it)" - at all.</p>
<p class="bas indent1"><span class="nm">(h)</span><span class="cl">Objection:</span> If so, also in the first case it should be disqualified!</p>
<p class="bas indent1"><span class="nm">(i)</span><span class="cl">Rejection #2:</span> This is like the law of Parah Adumah (the red heifer):</p>
<p class="bas indent2"><span class="nm">1.</span><span class="cl">(Mishnah):</span> If a bird rested on a Parah Adumah, it is not disqualified. If a male mated with it, it is disqualified.</p>
<p class="bas indent2"><span class="nm">2.</span><span class="cl">Question:</span> What is the reason?</p>
<p class="bas indent2"><span class="nm">3.</span><span class="cl">Answer:</span> This is like Rav Papa's teaching (about Eglah Arufah);</p>
<p class="bas indent3"><span class="nm">i.</span><span class="cl">(Rav Papa):</span> Had the Torah written 'Uvad (was worked)', and we would read it "Uvad", we would disqualify it even if it worked by itself;</p>
<p class="bas indent3"><span class="nm">ii.</span>Had the Torah written 'Ovad (he worked (with it))', and we would read it 'Ovad', we would disqualify it only if he worked with it;</p>
<p class="bas indent3"><span class="nm">iii.</span>Rather, the Torah wrote "Ovad", and tradition says to pronounce it "Uvad". We disqualify it if Uvad (it worked) similar to Ovad (he worked with it), i.e. he is pleased that it worked.</p>
<p class="bas indent1"><span class="nm">(j)</span><span class="cl">(Mishnah):</span> If one found silver or copper Kelim, he uses them...</p>
<p class="bas indent1"><span class="nm">(k)</span><span class="cl">(Beraisa):</span> If one found wooden Kelim, he uses them so they will not rot. Copper Kelim may be used with hot food, but he may not put them over a fire;</p>
<p class="bas indent1"><span class="nm">(l)</span>Silver Kelim may be used with cold food, but not with hot food, for this blackens them.</p>
<p class="bas indent1"><span class="nm">(m)</span>Shovels (for sweeping ashes) and axes should be used gently, not roughly, for this blunts them;</p>
<p class="bas indent1"><span class="nm">(n)</span>Gold or glass Kelim should be left until Eliyahu comes. One may not touch them.</p>
<p class="bas indent1"><span class="nm">(o)</span>The laws of an Aveidah apply also to a deposit (with a Shomer Chinam or Shomer Sachar).</p>
<p class="bas indent1"><span class="nm">(p)</span><span class="cl">Question:</span> Why should one use a deposit? (The owner will use it as often as he thinks is proper!)</p>
<p class="bas indent1"><span class="nm">(q)</span><span class="cl">Answer:</span> The case is, the owner went overseas.</p>
<p class="bas subject"><span class="nm">2)</span>AN <i>AVEIDAH</i> BELOW THE DIGNITY OF THE FINDER</p>
<p class="bas indent1"><span class="nm">(a)</span><span class="cl">(Mishnah):</span> If he finds a bag, box or anything that normally he would not carry it, he leaves it there.</p>
<p class="bas indent1"><span class="nm">(b)</span><span class="cl">Question:</span> What is the source for this?</p>
<p class="bas indent1"><span class="nm">(c)</span><span class="cl">Answer (Beraisa):</span> "V'His'alamta" - sometimes you ignore an Aveidah, and sometimes not;</p>
<p class="bas indent2"><span class="nm">1.</span>If a Kohen sees an Aveidah in a cemetery, or a Chacham sees an Aveidah that it is undignified for him to carry it, or if the Aveidah is worth less than what the finder will lose by ceasing from his work to return it, he ignores it.</p>
<p class="bas indent1"><span class="nm">(d)</span><span class="cl">Question:</span> For which of these was the verse needed?</p>
<p class="bas indent2"><span class="nm">1.</span><span class="cl">Suggestion:</span> It is for a Kohen who sees an Aveidah in a cemetery.</p>
<p class="bas indent2"><span class="nm">2.</span><span class="cl">Rejection:</span> This is obvious, no verse is needed!</p>
<p class="bas indent3"><span class="nm">i.</span>Returning an Aveidah is an Aseh (positive Mitzvah). A Lav (negative Mitzvah) and an Aseh ("Kedoshim Yiheyu") forbid a Kohen to become Tamei. An Aseh does not override a Lav and an Aseh!</p>
<p class="bas indent3"><span class="nm">ii.</span>Also, we do not override Isurim for (Mitzvos pertaining to) money!</p>
<p class="bas indent1"><span class="nm">(e)</span><span class="cl">Answer #1:</span> Rather, the verse is needed for when the cessation from his work exceeds the value of the Aveidah.</p>
<p class="bas indent1"><span class="nm">(f)</span><span class="cl">Rejection:</span> We know that from Rav Yehudah's law!</p>
<p class="bas indent2"><span class="nm">1.</span><span class="cl">(Rav Yehudah):</span> "Lo Yihyeh Becha Evyon (do not bring yourself to poverty)" - (avoiding) your own loss takes precedence.</p>
<p class="bas bbbline">30b----------------------------------------30b</p>
<p class="bas indent1"><span class="nm">(g)</span><span class="cl">Answer #2:</span> Rather, the verse is needed for a Chacham who finds something below his dignity.</p>
<p class="bas indent1"><span class="nm">(h)</span><span class="cl">(Rabah):</span> If the Chacham hit the animal (so it will return to its owner), he is obligated to return it.</p>
<p class="bas indent1"><span class="nm">(i)</span>Abaye saw some goats. He threw a clod of earth at them.</p>
<p class="bas indent1"><span class="nm">(j)</span><span class="cl">Rabah:</span> You are obligated to return them.</p>
<p class="bas indent1"><span class="nm">(k)</span><span class="cl">Question:</span> If the Chacham would return it in the field (where few people see him), but not in the city, must he take it from the field to return it to the city?</p>
<p class="bas indent2"><span class="nm">1.</span>Since he is not obligated to fully return it, he need not start;</p>
<p class="bas indent2"><span class="nm">2.</span>Or, in the field, he is obligated to take it, and once he starts, he must finish!</p>
<p class="bas indent2"><span class="nm">3.</span>This question is not resolved.</p>
<p class="bas indent1"><span class="nm">(l)</span><span class="cl">(Rava):</span> Anything that a Chacham would take if it were his own, he must return if it belongs to another;</p>
<p class="bas indent2"><span class="nm">1.</span>If a Chacham would load or unload his own animal, he must help others load or unload.</p>
<p class="bas indent1"><span class="nm">(m)</span>R. Yishmael b'Rebbi Yosi saw a man carrying wood. The man rested, then asked R. Yishmael to help him load the wood. R. Yishmael bought the wood (to avoid needing to help), and made it Hefker. The man acquired the wood and asked for help; R. Yishmael again bought it and made it Hefker. He saw the man going to acquire it again.</p>
<p class="bas indent1"><span class="nm">(n)</span><span class="cl">R. Yishmael:</span> It is Hefker to all except for you.</p>
<p class="bas indent1"><span class="nm">(o)</span><span class="cl">Question:</span> That is not Hefker!</p>
<p class="bas indent2"><span class="nm">1.</span><span class="cl">(Mishnah - Beis Shamai):</span> If something is Hefker only for poor people to take, it is Hefker (and is exempt from Ma'aser);</p>
<p class="bas indent2"><span class="nm">2.</span>Beis Hillel say, it is Hefker only if rich and poor may take it, like Shemitah.</p>
<p class="bas indent1"><span class="nm">(p)</span><span class="cl">Answer:</span> Really, R. Yishmael made it Hefker for all. He deceived the man, lest he take it again.</p>
<p class="bas indent1"><span class="nm">(q)</span><span class="cl">Question:</span> (Loading) wood is below the honor of R. Yishmael b'Rebbi Yosi. He was exempt!</p>
<p class="bas indent1"><span class="nm">(r)</span><span class="cl">Answer:</span> R. Yishmael b'Rebbi Yosi went beyond the letter of the law.</p>
<p class="bas indent2"><span class="nm">1.</span><span class="cl">(Rav Yosef):</span> "V'Hodata Lahem" is learning a trade (some explain - Torah). "Ha'Derech" is Chesed. "Asher Yelchu Vah" is Bikur Cholim (investigating the needs of sick). "Vah" is burying the dead. "Ha'Ma'aseh" is the law. "Asher Ya'asun" is going beyond the letter of the law.</p>
<p class="bas indent2"><span class="nm">2.</span><span class="cl">Question:</span> Bikur Cholim is included in Chesed!</p>
<p class="bas indent2"><span class="nm">3.</span><span class="cl">Answer:</span> The Torah must teach about Ben Gilo (someone with the same Mazal as himself).</p>
<p class="bas indent3"><span class="nm">i.</span>It was taught that if one visits Ben Gilo, one part in 60 of the sickness goes from the Choleh to the visitor.</p>
<p class="bas indent3"><span class="nm">ii.</span>The verse obligates Bikur Cholim even in this case.</p>
<p class="bas indent2"><span class="nm">4.</span><span class="cl">Question:</span> Burying the dead is included in Chesed!</p>
<p class="bas indent2"><span class="nm">5.</span><span class="cl">Answer:</span> The Torah must teach about a Chacham for whom it is beneath his dignity to dig. (For burial, he is obligated.)</p>
<p class="bas indent2"><span class="nm">6.</span><span class="cl">(R. Yochanan):</span> Yerushalayim was destroyed only because they judged like Torah law.</p>
<p class="bas indent2"><span class="nm">7.</span><span class="cl">Question:</span> How should they have judged, using torture?!</p>
<p class="bas indent2"><span class="nm">8.</span><span class="cl">Answer:</span> He means, they adhered to the law, and did not go beyond the letter of the law.</p>
<p class="bas subject"><span class="nm">3)</span>WHAT IS CONSIDERED LOST?</p>
<p class="bas indent1"><span class="nm">(a)</span><span class="cl">(Mishnah):</span> What is an Aveidah? If a donkey or cow was grazing on the path, this is not considered lost;</p>
<p class="bas indent2"><span class="nm">1.</span>If the Kelim on a donkey are reversed, or a cow is running through a vineyard, this is an Aveidah.</p>
<p class="bas indent1"><span class="nm">(b)</span>If he returned it and it got lost again, he returned it and it got lost again, even four or five times, he must return it - "Hashev Teshivem".</p>
<p class="bas indent1"><span class="nm">(c)</span>If in the time Reuven spent returning the Aveidah, he lost one Sela of earnings, he may not demand compensation of one Sela. Rather, he is paid like a worker (this will be explained).</p>
<p class="bas indent2"><span class="nm">1.</span>(If he wants full compensation,) if there is a Beis Din there, he stipulates with Beis Din. If not, he is exempt from returning, for he would lose money.</p>
<p class="bas indent1"><span class="nm">(d)</span><span class="cl">(Gemara) Question:</span> Why does the Mishnah ask 'what is an Aveidah?' The previous Mishnayos gave many examples!</p>
<p class="bas indent1"><span class="nm">(e)</span><span class="cl">Answer (Rav Yehudah):</span> The Mishnah asks how to discern whether or not something is an Aveidah.</p>
<p class="bas indent1"><span class="nm">(f)</span><span class="cl">Question:</span> If a donkey or cow was grazing on the path, no matter how long, will we say that it is not an Aveidah?!</p>
<p class="bas indent1"><span class="nm">(g)</span><span class="cl">Answer (Rav Yehudah):</span> Until three days, it is not an Aveidah.</p>
<p class="bas indent1"><span class="nm">(h)</span><span class="cl">Question:</span> What is the case?</p>
<p class="bas indent2"><span class="nm">1.</span>At night, even after a moment, it is an Aveidah!</p>
<p class="bas indent2"><span class="nm">2.</span>During the day, even more than three days, it is not an Aveidah!</p>
<p class="bas indent1"><span class="nm">(i)</span><span class="cl">Answer:</span> The case is, he saw it before dawn or at dusk.</p>
<p class="bas indent2"><span class="nm">1.</span>For three days, we say that it just occurred that way. After this, we say that it is an Aveidah.</p>
