<p class="bas subject"><span class="nm">1)</span>LAWS OF PATHS</p>
<p class="bas indent1"><span class="nm">(a)</span><span class="cl">Question:</span> If so, why does he lose the path he gave? Let him say 'take your path, and give mine back to me!'</p>
<p class="bas indent1"><span class="nm">(b)</span><span class="cl">Answer:</span> Our Mishnah is R. Eliezer.</p>
<p class="bas indent2"><span class="nm">1.</span><span class="cl">(Beraisa - R. Yehudah citing R. Eliezer):</span> If the public chose a path (in Reuven's property), they keep it.</p>
<p class="bas indent1"><span class="nm">(c)</span><span class="cl">Question:</span> Are the public robbers?!</p>
<p class="bas indent1"><span class="nm">(d)</span><span class="cl">Answer (Rav Gidal citing Rav):</span> The case is, they had a path in Reuven's land, and it was lost.</p>
<p class="bas indent1"><span class="nm">(e)</span><span class="cl">Question:</span> If so, (surely they keep it;) why did Rabah bar Rav Huna teach in Rav's name that the Halachah does not follow R. Eliezer?</p>
<p class="bas indent1"><span class="nm">(f)</span><span class="cl">Answer:</span> These Amora'im argue about Rav's opinion. (He only taught one of these teachings.)</p>
<p class="bas indent1"><span class="nm">(g)</span><span class="cl">Question:</span> According to Rabah bar Rav Huna, what is the reason in our Mishnah? (Presumably, it is not like R. Eliezer, for the Halachah does not follow him!)</p>
<p class="bas indent1"><span class="nm">(h)</span><span class="cl">Answer:</span> It is like Rav Yehudah taught, that one may not reclaim any property that is used for a public thoroughfare.</p>
<p class="bas indent1"><span class="nm">(i)</span><span class="cl">Question:</span> According to R. Eliezer, how does the public acquire the path?</p>
<p class="bas indent1"><span class="nm">(j)</span><span class="cl">Answer:</span> They acquire it through walking on it.</p>
<p class="bas indent2"><span class="nm">1.</span><span class="cl">(Beraisa - R. Eliezer):</span> If Reuven walked the length and width of Shimon's field, he acquires where he walked;</p>
<p class="bas indent2"><span class="nm">2.</span>Chachamim say, walking does not acquire. He must make Chazakah.</p>
<p class="bas indent1"><span class="nm">(k)</span><span class="cl">Question:</span> What is R. Eliezer's source?</p>
<p class="bas indent1"><span class="nm">(l)</span><span class="cl">Answer:</span> "His'halech ba'Aretz l'Arkah ul'Rachbah Ki Lecha Etnenah."</p>
<p class="bas indent2"><span class="nm">1.</span>Chachamim say, that was due to Hash-m's love for Avraham, He wanted that it should be easy for Avraham's descendants to conquer it (it will be like an inheritance).</p>
<p class="bas indent1"><span class="nm">(m)</span><span class="cl">(R. Yosi b'Rebbi Chanina):</span> Chachamim admit to R. Eliezer about a path in a vineyard. Since it is exclusively for walking, it is acquired through walking.</p>
<p class="bas indent1"><span class="nm">(n)</span>When people would come to R. Yitzchak bar Ami (Rashbam - regarding a sale of a path in a vineyard; R. Chananel - regarding one who lost the path to his field), he would give a path wide enough to carry a load of vines and turn around;</p>
<p class="bas indent2"><span class="nm">1.</span><span class="cl">Version #1 (Rashbam):</span> This is only if there are walls on both sides of the path. If not, it suffices to give a path wide enough to walk on (the bundle can hang over the sides).</p>
<p class="bas indent2"><span class="nm">2.</span><span class="cl">Version #2 (Tosfos):</span> This is only if there are not (low) walls on both sides of the path. If there are, he only gets between the walls (the bundle can hang over the walls).</p>
<p class="bas subject"><span class="nm">2)</span>THE WIDTH OF ROADS</p>
<p class="bas indent1"><span class="nm">(a)</span><span class="cl">(Mishnah):</span> A private road is four Amos.</p>
<p class="bas indent1"><span class="nm">(b)</span><span class="cl">(Beraisa - Others):</span> He gets enough to enable a loaded donkey to pass.</p>
<p class="bas indent1"><span class="nm">(c)</span><span class="cl">(Rav Huna):</span> The Halachah follows Others.</p>
<p class="bas indent1"><span class="nm">(d)</span><span class="cl">(Beraisa - judges of Bavel):</span> The path is only two and a half Amos wide.</p>
<p class="bas indent1"><span class="nm">(e)</span><span class="cl">(Rav Huna):</span> The Halachah follows judges of Bavel.</p>
<p class="bas indent1"><span class="nm">(f)</span><span class="cl">Question:</span> Rav Huna ruled like Others!</p>
<p class="bas indent1"><span class="nm">(g)</span><span class="cl">Answer:</span> Two and a half Amos are needed for a loaded donkey to pass.</p>
<p class="bas indent1"><span class="nm">(h)</span><span class="cl">(Beraisa):</span> A Reshus ha'Rabim is 16 Amos.</p>
<p class="bas indent1"><span class="nm">(i)</span><span class="cl">(Beraisa):</span> A private road is four Amos. An intercity road is eight Amos. A Reshus ha'Rabim is 16 Amos. A road to a city of refuge is 32 Amos.</p>
<p class="bas bbbline">100b----------------------------------------100b</p>
<p class="bas indent1"><span class="nm">(j)</span><span class="cl">(Rav Huna):</span> We learn from "Tachin Lecha <i>ha</i>'Derech" - the extra 'Hei' teaches to add the width of a normal path.</p>
<p class="bas indent1"><span class="nm">(k)</span><span class="cl">(Mishnah):</span> There is no limit to the road for a king.</p>
<p class="bas indent1"><span class="nm">(l)</span>This is because the king may breach fences to make a path for himself.</p>
<p class="bas indent1"><span class="nm">(m)</span><span class="cl">(Mishnah):</span> There is no limit to the road for a funeral procession.</p>
<p class="bas indent1"><span class="nm">(n)</span>This is due to the honor of the deceased.</p>
<p class="bas subject"><span class="nm">3)</span>MA'AMADOS</p>
<p class="bas indent1"><span class="nm">(a)</span><span class="cl">(Mishnah):</span> Judges of Tzipori say, we allow an area of Beis Arba'ah Kavim for a Ma'amad.</p>
<p class="bas indent1"><span class="nm">(b)</span><span class="cl">(Beraisa):</span> If one sells (the place reserved for) his grave, the path to it, or the place of his Ma'amad and eulogy, his family can bury him there against the will of the buyer.</p>
<p class="bas indent1"><span class="nm">(c)</span><span class="cl">(Beraisa):</span> We make at least seven Ma'amados and Moshavos (stops on the way to burial) for a deceased, corresponding to the seven 'Havalim' (follies) in the first verse of Koheles - "Havel Havalim..."</p>
<p class="bas indent1"><span class="nm">(d)</span><span class="cl">Question (Rav Acha brei d'Rava):</span> How are they done?</p>
<p class="bas indent1"><span class="nm">(e)</span><span class="cl">Answer (Rav Ashi - Beraisa - R. Yehudah):</span> In Yehudah, they used to make at least seven Ma'amados and Moshavos, e.g. 'stop, dear ones, stop; wait, dear ones, wait.'</p>
<p class="bas indent2"><span class="nm">1.</span><span class="cl">Chachamim:</span> If so (this is Ma'amados and Moshavos), it should be permitted even on Shabbos!</p>
<p class="bas indent1"><span class="nm">(f)</span>Rami bar Papa's sister was married to Rav Avya; she died. Rav Avya made a Ma'amad and Moshav for her.</p>
<p class="bas indent1"><span class="nm">(g)</span><span class="cl">(Rav Yosef):</span> He made two mistakes:</p>
<p class="bas indent2"><span class="nm">1.</span>We make Ma'amados and Moshavos only with relatives (who are not mourners), but he made with strangers;</p>
<p class="bas indent2"><span class="nm">2.</span>We only do so on the day of burial, but he did so on the next day.</p>
<p class="bas indent1"><span class="nm">(h)</span><span class="cl">(Abaye):</span> He also erred by doing it in the city. We do it only in the cemetery.</p>
<p class="bas indent1"><span class="nm">(i)</span><span class="cl">(Rava):</span> He also erred by doing it where it was not the local custom.</p>
<p class="bas indent1"><span class="nm">(j)</span><span class="cl">Question (Beraisa - Chachamim):</span> If so, it should be permitted even on Shabbos!</p>
<p class="bas indent2"><span class="nm">1.</span>If it is only done in the cemetery (on the day or burial - Maharsha deletes this from the text), people would not be there on Shabbos! (Normally, cemeteries are outside the Techum of the city.)</p>
<p class="bas indent1"><span class="nm">(k)</span><span class="cl">Answer:</span> The case is, the cemetery was within the Techum. (The burial was shortly before Shabbos, so there was no time for Ma'amados and Moshavos before Shabbos. The night after burial is considered the day of burial).</p>
