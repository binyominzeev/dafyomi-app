<div class="subject"><span class="nm">1)</span><p>WHO IS THE TANA OF OUR MISHNAH?</p></div>
<div class="indent1"><span class="nm">(a)</span><p><span class="cl">Question:</span> Who is the Tana of our Mishnah [which forbids a Yisrael's Chametz after Pesach]?</p></div>
<div class="indent2"><span class="nm">1.</span><p>It is not R. Yehudah - he forbids [even a Nochri's] Chametz after Pesach (the verses he expound apply to anyone's Chametz)!</p></div>
<div class="indent2"><span class="nm">2.</span><p>It is not R. Shimon - he permits even a Yisrael's Chametz [after Pesach];</p></div>
<div class="indent2"><span class="nm">3.</span><p>It is not R. Yosi ha'Gelili - he permits benefit even during Pesach!</p></div>
<div class="indent1"><span class="nm">(b)</span><p><span class="cl">Answer #1 (Rav Acha bar Yakov):</span> Really, it is R. Yehudah - he learns eating Se'or [or Chametz] from seeing it:</p></div>
<div class="indent2"><span class="nm">1.</span><p>["V'Lo Yera'eh Lecha" - but] you may see Chametz of others or of Hekdesh - the same applies to eating [after Pesach];</p></div>
<div class="indent2"><span class="nm">2.</span><p>Really, R. Yehudah should have taught [in the Mishnah] that [after Pesach] one may <i>eat</i> Chametz of others or of Hekdesh - but since he must teach that Chametz of a Yisrael is Asur b'Hana'ah, he taught that Chametz of a Nochri is Mutar b'Hana'ah.</p></div>
<div class="indent2"><span class="nm">3.</span><p>Really, he should have taught that one may benefit from Chametz of others or of Hekdesh even during Pesach - but since he must teach that Chametz of a Yisrael is Asur after Pesach, he taught that Chametz of a Nochri is Mutar after Pesach.</p></div>
<div class="indent1"><span class="nm">(c)</span><p><span class="cl">Answer #2 (Rava):</span> Really, it is R. Shimon - R. Shimon fines [to forbid Chametz of a Yisrael after Pesach] because he transgressed Bal Yera'eh and Bal Yimatzei.</p></div>
<div class="indent1"><span class="nm">(d)</span><p><span class="cl">Question:</span> According to Rava, we understand why it says 'Chametz that a Yisrael owned on Pesach is Asur b'Hana'ah, for it says "V'Lo Yera'eh Lecha'" - but according to Rav Acha bar Yakov, R. Yehudah learns from "V'Lo Ye'achel Chametz"!</p></div>
<div class="indent1"><span class="nm">(e)</span><p><span class="cl">Answer:</span> The verse does not explain the Seifa, rather, the Reisha:</p></div>
<div class="indent2"><span class="nm">1.</span><p>One may benefit from Chametz that a Nochri owned on Pesach, for it says "V'Lo Yera'eh Lecha" - but you may see Chametz of others or of Hekdesh.</p></div>
<div class="indent2"><span class="nm">2.</span><p>He learns eating Se'or [or Chametz] from seeing it:</p></div>
<div class="indent1"><span class="nm">(f)</span><p>They are consistent with what they taught elsewhere:</p></div>
<div class="indent2"><span class="nm">1.</span><p><span class="cl">(Rava):</span> According to R. Yehudah, if one eats [after Pesach] Chametz that a Nochri owned during Pesach, he is lashed;</p></div>
<div class="indent2"><span class="nm">2.</span><p><span class="cl">(Rav Acha bar Yakov):</span> He is not lashed.</p></div>
<div class="indent2"><span class="nm">3.</span><p>Rava says that he is lashed - R. Yehudah does not learn eating Se'or from seeing it;</p></div>
<div class="indent2"><span class="nm">4.</span><p>Rav Acha says that he is not lashed - he learns eating Se'or from seeing it.</p></div>
<div class="subject"><span class="nm">2)</span><p>ME'ILAH FOR CHAMETZ DURING PESACH</p></div>
<div class="indent1"><span class="nm">(a)</span><p>Rav Acha retracted  - we know this from his explanation of the following Beraisa.</p></div>
<div class="indent1"><span class="nm">(b)</span><p><span class="cl">(Beraisa):</span> If one ate Chametz of Hekdesh during Pesach, he was Mo'el;</p></div>
<div class="indent1"><span class="nm">(c)</span><p>Some say that he was not Mo'el.</p></div>
<div class="indent1"><span class="nm">(d)</span><p><span class="cl">Question:</span> Which Tana exempts [or what do they argue about]?</p></div>
<div class="indent1"><span class="nm">(e)</span><p><span class="cl">Answer #1 (R. Yochanan):</span> (All agree that the Chametz has value to Hekdesh. Rashi - it can be redeemed after Pesach, when it will be permitted - this is like R. Shimon; Ba'al ha'Ma'or - it is like R. Yosi ha'Gelili, it can be redeemed even during Pesach, to benefit (e.g. cook) from it while burning it.) R. Nechunya ben Hakanah exempts:</p></div>
<div class="indent2"><span class="nm">1.</span><p><span class="cl">(Beraisa - R. Nechunya Ben Hakanah):</span> Yom Kipur is like Shabbos regarding paying [for damage done while performing Melachah] - on Shabbos, since he Chayav Misah (worthy of death) for the Melachah, he is exempt from payment - similarly, on Yom Kipur, he is Chayav [Kares, a severe form of] Misah [at the hands of Heaven] and exempt from payment. (Likewise, one who is Chayav Kares for eating Chametz is exempt from payment, therefore there is no Me'ilah.)</p></div>
<div class="indent1"><span class="nm">(f)</span><p><span class="cl">Version #1 - Answer #2 (Rav Yosef):</span> They argue about whether or not we may redeem Kodshim [that Yisraelim may not eat even after redemption] to feed them to dogs:</p></div>
<div class="indent2"><span class="nm">1.</span><p>The first opinion permits (therefore the Chametz has value to Hekdesh, since it could have been redeemed), and the second opinion forbids.</p></div>
<div class="bbbline">29b----------------------------------------29b</p></div>
<div class="indent1"><span class="nm">(g)</span><p><span class="cl">Version #2 - Rav Acha bar Rava - Answer #3 (Rav Yosef):</span> All forbid redeeming Kodshim to feed them to dogs - they argue about whether or not Davar ha'Gorem l'Mamon (something which is forbidden now [or is not considered a person's property], but later it will be permitted [or save him money], e.g. Chametz which will be permitted after Pesach) k'Mamon Dami (is considered like money):</p></div>
<div class="indent2"><span class="nm">1.</span><p>The first opinion holds that Davar ha'Gorem l'Mamon is k'Mamon, the second opinion holds that it is not k'Mamon,</p></div>
<div class="indent1"><span class="nm">(h)</span><p><span class="cl">Answer #4 (Rav Acha bar Yakov):</span> All agree that it is k'Mamon - they argue like R. Yehudah and R. Shimon:</p></div>
<div class="indent2"><span class="nm">1.</span><p>The first opinion holds like R. Shimon, the second opinion holds like R. Yehudah.</p></div>
<div class="indent2"><span class="nm">2.</span><p><span class="cl">Question:</span> But Rav Acha bar Yakov said that R. Yehudah learns eating Se'or from seeing it [and permits after Pesach]!</p></div>
<div class="indent2"><span class="nm">3.</span><p><span class="cl">Answer:</span> He retracted from this. (Me'il Shmuel - he cannot establish our Mishnah like R. Yehudah, for then the Halachah would follow him; if so, Matzah would be mid'Oraisa nowadays (28B) - but Rav Acha says that it is only mid'Rabanan (120A)!)</p></div>
<div class="indent1"><span class="nm">(i)</span><p><span class="cl">Answer #5 (Rav Ashi):</span> All agree that we may not redeem Kodshim to feed them to dogs, and Davar ha'Gorem l'Mamon Lav k'Mamon - they argue like R. Yosi ha'Gelili [who permits benefit from Chametz during Pesach] and Chachamim:</p></div>
<div class="indent2"><span class="nm">1.</span><p>The second opinion holds like Chachamim, the first opinion holds like R. Yosi (Tosfos - because Chametz is not Kedushas ha'Guf, the Isur to redeem it to feed to dogs is only mid'Rabanan, hence one may redeem for other uses, therefore it has value to Hekdesh).</p></div>
<div class="subject"><span class="nm">3)</span><p>WHEN ARE MIXTURES OF CHAMETZ FORBIDDEN?</p></div>
<div class="indent1"><span class="nm">(a)</span><p><span class="cl">(Rav):</span> In its time (during Pesach), Chametz is forbidden both b'Mino (if it is mixed with its own kind, i.e. grain) and she'Lo b'Mino (this will be explained);</p></div>
<div class="indent1"><span class="nm">(b)</span><p>Not in its time (after Pesach), Chametz is forbidden b'Mino but permitted she'Lo b'Mino.</p></div>
<div class="indent1"><span class="nm">(c)</span><p><span class="cl">Question:</span> What is the case?</p></div>
<div class="indent1"><span class="nm">(d)</span><p><span class="cl">Answer #1:</span> The Chametz is Nosen Ta'am (it can be tasted in the mixture).</p></div>
<div class="indent1"><span class="nm">(e)</span><p><span class="cl">Rejection:</span> If so, it would be forbidden not in its time she'Lo b'Mino!</p></div>
<div class="indent1"><span class="nm">(f)</span><p><span class="cl">Answer #2:</span> There is Mashehu of Chametz (a drop, it is not Nosen Ta'am).</p></div>
<div class="indent1"><span class="nm">(g)</span><p>In its time, Chametz [b'Mashehu] is forbidden b'Mino and Lo b'Mino - this is like Rav taught elsewhere:</p></div>
<div class="indent2"><span class="nm">1.</span><p><span class="cl">(Rav and Shmuel):</span> All forbidden foods, if mixed b'Mino, forbid b'Mashehu; Lo b'Mino, they forbid b'Nosen Ta'am.</p></div>
<div class="indent2"><span class="nm">2.</span><p>In its time, Rav decrees [to forbid] she'Lo b'Mino on account of b'Mino.</p></div>
<div class="indent2"><span class="nm">3.</span><p>Not in its time, it is forbidden b'Mino - this is like R. Yehudah;</p></div>
<div class="indent3"><span class="nm">i.</span><p>She'Lo b'Mino is permitted - we do not decree on account of Mino (there is no Kares at this time, it is like other Isurim).</p></div>
<div class="indent1"><span class="nm">(h)</span><p><span class="cl">(Shmuel):</span> In its time, Chametz [b'Mashehu] is forbidden b'Mino, but permitted she'Lo b'Mino;</p></div>
<div class="indent2"><span class="nm">1.</span><p>Not in its time, it is permitted even b'Mino.</p></div>

<div class="indent2"><span class="nm">1.</span><p><span class="cl">(R. Yochanan and Reish Lakish):</span> All Isurim forbid b'Nosen Ta'am, whether b'Mino or Lo b'Mino; (they agree that some things forbid b'Mashehu b'Mino, i.e. Yayin Nesech and Davar she'Yesh Lo Matirim - Avodah Zarah 73B);</p></div>
<div class="indent2"><span class="nm">2.</span><p>Not in its time, it is permitted even b'Mino - this is like R. Shimon.</p></div>
