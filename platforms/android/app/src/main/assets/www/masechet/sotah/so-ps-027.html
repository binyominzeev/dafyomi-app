<p class="bas subject"><span class="nm">1)</span>A WOMAN OF ILL REPUTE</p>
<p class="bas indent1"><span class="nm">(a)</span><span class="cl">(Shmuel):</span> It is better to marry a woman of ill repute than to marry her daughter.</p>
<p class="bas indent2"><span class="nm">1.</span>(One can know that) the woman comes from proper parents. Perhaps her daughter is from a Nochri or Mamzer!</p>
<p class="bas indent1"><span class="nm">(b)</span><span class="cl">(R. Yochanan):</span> It is better to marry her daughter than the woman (of ill repute).</p>
<p class="bas indent2"><span class="nm">1.</span>(This is if) the daughter acts properly. The mother acts improperly.</p>
<p class="bas indent1"><span class="nm">(c)</span><span class="cl">Question (against R. Yochanan - Beraisa):</span> One may marry a woman of ill repute.</p>
<p class="bas indent2"><span class="nm">1.</span><span class="cl">Counter-question (Rava):</span> Obviously, this is wrong. One should not marry her l'Chatchilah!</p>
<p class="bas indent2"><span class="nm">2.</span><span class="cl">Answer:</span> Rather, it should say, if he married her, he may remain married.</p>
<p class="bas indent1"><span class="nm">(d)</span><span class="cl">Answer:</span> Since the Beraisa must be altered, we can alter it to say that one may marry the daughter of a woman of ill repute.</p>
<p class="bas indent1"><span class="nm">(e)</span>The Halachah is, it is better to marry her daughter than the woman (of ill repute).</p>
<p class="bas indent1"><span class="nm">(f)</span><span class="cl">(Rav Tachlifa bar Ma'arava):</span> If a married woman had Bi'ah with others, her children are Kesheirim. We may assume most of her Bi'os were with her husband.</p>
<p class="bas indent1"><span class="nm">(g)</span><span class="cl">Question (Rav Amram):</span> What if she is exceedingly licentious? (Perhaps most of her Bi'os were with others!)</p>
<p class="bas indent2"><span class="nm">1.</span>According to the opinion that a woman usually becomes pregnant shortly (the day) before her Veses (when she is due to menstruate), clearly, her children are forbidden (if she did not have a regular Veses. Perhaps she became pregnant from another man.)</p>
<p class="bas indent2"><span class="nm">2.</span>We ask according to the opinion that a woman usually becomes pregnant right after immersing (after being a Nidah).</p>
<p class="bas indent3"><span class="nm">i.</span>Do we say, her husband guards her that day, to ensure that she will not become pregnant from another man?</p>
<p class="bas indent3"><span class="nm">ii.</span>Or, since she is so licentious, he cannot guard her?</p>
<p class="bas indent1"><span class="nm">(h)</span>This question is unresolved.</p>
<p class="bas subject"><span class="nm">2)</span><i>BEIS DIN </i>CAN WARN</p>
<p class="bas indent1"><span class="nm">(a)</span><span class="cl">(Mishnah):</span> Beis Din warns...</p>
<p class="bas indent1"><span class="nm">(b)</span><span class="cl">(Beraisa):</span> "Ish Ish" teaches that Beis Din warns the wife of a deaf man, lunatic or bewildered man, or a man who went overseas or is imprisoned;</p>
<p class="bas indent1"><span class="nm">(c)</span>If she is secluded, she (becomes forbidden and) forfeits her Kesuvah, but she cannot drink - "the man will bring his wife";</p>
<p class="bas indent1"><span class="nm">(d)</span>R. Yosi says, he can make her drink when he returns.</p>
<p class="bas indent1"><span class="nm">(e)</span><span class="cl">Question:</span> What is the source of the argument?</p>
<p class="bas indent1"><span class="nm">(f)</span><span class="cl">Answer:</span> Chachamim require "he will warn... and he (the same man) will bring (to drink). R. Yosi does not require this.</p>
<p class="bas indent1"><span class="nm">(g)</span><span class="cl">(Beraisa):</span> "A woman who will stray under her husband" equates her to him, and him to her.</p>
<p class="bas indent1"><span class="nm">(h)</span><span class="cl">Question:</span> What do we learn from this?</p>
<p class="bas indent1"><span class="nm">(i)</span><span class="cl">Answer #1 (Rav Sheshes):</span> A blind man's wife does not drink - "it was hidden from her husband's eyes." Likewise, if she is blind, she does not drink.</p>
<p class="bas indent1"><span class="nm">(j)</span><span class="cl">Answer #2 (Rav Ashi):</span> A lame woman or a woman without hands does not drink - "he will stand the woman in front of Hash-m and put (the Minchah) on her hands." Likewise, if he is lame or handless, she does not drink.</p>
<p class="bas bbbline">27b----------------------------------------27b</p>
<p class="bas indent1"><span class="nm">(k)</span><span class="cl">Answer #3 (Mar bar Rav Ashi):</span> A mute woman does not drink - "the woman says Amen, Amen." Likewise, if he is mute, she does not drink.</p>
<p class="perekline">PEREK K'SHEM SHEHA'MAYIM</p>
<p class="bas subject"><span class="nm">3)</span>THE <i>BO'EL</i> IS ALSO PUNISHED AND FORBIDDEN</p>
<p class="bas indent1"><span class="nm">(a)</span><span class="cl">(Mishnah):</span> Just like the water checks her, it also checks him (this will be explained). It says "and (the water) will come", "and will come."</p>
<p class="bas indent1"><span class="nm">(b)</span>R. Akiva says, just like she is forbidden to her husband (until she drinks), she is forbidden to the Bo'el - it says "she was defiled", "and she was defiled."</p>
<p class="bas indent2"><span class="nm">1.</span><span class="cl">R. Yehoshua:</span> Zecharyah ben ha'Katzav also expounded this way.</p>
<p class="bas indent1"><span class="nm">(c)</span>Rebbi says, it says twice "she was defiled" twice. This teaches that she is (permanently) forbidden to her husband and the Bo'el.</p>
<p class="bas subject"><span class="nm">4)</span>LAWS TAUGHT ON THE SPECIAL DAY</p>
<p class="bas indent1"><span class="nm">(a)</span><span class="cl">(Continuation of the Mishnah):</span> On that day (when R. Elazar ben Azaryah became Nasi, and all were permitted to enter the Beis Medrash), R. Akiva expounded "if (a rodent) will fall into any earthenware Kli, any food in the Kli Yitma (will become Tamei)." The Torah wrote Yitma, for this can be read Yetamei (will be Metamei);</p>
<p class="bas indent2"><span class="nm">1.</span>This teaches that a loaf that is a Sheni (second degree Tum'ah, i.e. a Rishon (something that touched a source of Tum'ah) makes another food a Shlishi (third degree Tum'ah).</p>
<p class="bas indent2"><span class="nm">2.</span><span class="cl">R. Yishmael:</span> R. Yochanan ben Zakai was concerned lest later generations say that there is no Shlishi (i.e. a Sheni is not Metamei other food, even Terumah), for no verse teaches this. R. Akiva, his Talmid, found a verse (even regarding Chulin)!</p>
<p class="bas indent1"><span class="nm">(b)</span><span class="cl">Contradiction:</span> "You will measure 2000 Amos outside the city, to the east..." (and this is part of the Levite city). Another verse says "1000 Amos from the wall of the city"!</p>
<p class="bas indent1"><span class="nm">(c)</span><span class="cl">Resolution #1 (R. Akiva):</span> We leave 1000 Amos vacant. 2000 Amos is the Techum within which one may walk on Shabbos;</p>
<p class="bas indent1"><span class="nm">(d)</span><span class="cl">Resolution #2 (R. Eliezer, son of R. Yosi ha'Glili):</span> We leave 1000 Amos vacant. The second 1000 Amos are for fields and vineyards.</p>
<p class="bas indent1"><span class="nm">(e)</span><span class="cl">Question:</span> What do we learn from "then Moshe and Bnei Yisrael (sang)... and they said, saying"?</p>
<p class="bas indent1"><span class="nm">(f)</span><span class="cl">Answer #1 (R. Akiva):</span> It teaches that after Moshe sang each segment, Bnei Yisrael answered, just like a Tzibur answers when the Shali'ach Tzibur sings Hallel;</p>
<p class="bas indent1"><span class="nm">(g)</span>R. Nechemyah says, they answered like a Tzibur answers Shema Yisrael, not like it answers Hallel.</p>
<p class="bas indent1"><span class="nm">(h)</span>R. Yehoshua ben Hurkenos expounded that Iyov served Hash-m out of love - "if Hash-m would kill me, Lo (to Him) I will hope";</p>
<p class="bas indent2"><span class="nm">1.</span>This is not a proof. We could explain "Lo" to mean 'not'!</p>
<p class="bas indent2"><span class="nm">2.</span>"Until I expire, my purity will not veer from me" teaches that he served from love.</p>
<p class="bas indent1"><span class="nm">(i)</span><span class="cl">R. Yehoshua:</span> R. Yochanan ben Zakai always taught that Iyov served from fear - "a pure man, straight, who fears Hash-m, who veers from evil." His Talmid taught that he served from love!</p>
