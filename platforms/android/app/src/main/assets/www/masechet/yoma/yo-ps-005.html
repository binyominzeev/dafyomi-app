<div class="subject"><span class="nm">1)</span><p>BACK TO RESH LAKISH AND R. YOCHANAN (bottom of 4b)</p></div>
<div class="indent1"><span class="nm">(a)</span><p>We may infer that they both hold that whatever is written in the Parshas Miluim is Me'akev (aligning with one side in the Machlokes below).</p></div>
<div class="subject"><span class="nm">2)</span><p>R. YOCHANAN AND R. CHANINA ON WHAT IS ME'AKEV BY MILUIM</p></div>
<div class="indent1"><span class="nm">(a)</span><p>There is a Machklokes whether all details of the Miluim are Me'akev, or only those details which are normally Me'akev.</p></div>
<div class="indent1"><span class="nm">(b)</span><p>We may conclude that R. Yochanan is of the opinion that all the details are Me'akev.</p></div>
<div class="indent2"><span class="nm">1.</span><p>This is based on the question which Resh Lakish asked on R. Yochanan (that if Perishah is learned from Miluim then it should be Me'akev by Yom ha'Kipurim, as well).</p></div>
<div class="indent2"><span class="nm">2.</span><p>R. Yochanan, by not responding, showed his agreement.</p></div>
<div class="indent1"><span class="nm">(c)</span><p><span class="cl">Question:</span> Of what (Halachic) difference is their dispute?</p></div>
<div class="indent1"><span class="nm">(d)</span><p><span class="cl">Answer #1:</span> Semichah.</p></div>
<div class="indent2"><span class="nm">1.</span><p><span class="cl">Question:</span> How do we know that Semichah is normally not Me'akev?</p></div>
<div class="indent2"><span class="nm">2.</span><p><span class="cl">Answer:</span> From a Beraisa which speaks of Semichah as the Kaparah of the Korban, but in the end teaches that its absence does not prevent the Kaparah.</p></div>
<div class="indent1"><span class="nm">(e)</span><p><span class="cl">Answer #2:</span> Tenufah (same Q&A sequence follows as above).</p></div>
<div class="indent1"><span class="nm">(f)</span><p><span class="cl">Answer #3:</span> Perishas Shiv'a.</p></div>
<div class="indent2"><span class="nm">1.</span><p><span class="cl">Question:</span> Whence that Perishah is normally not Me'akev?</p></div>
<div class="indent2"><span class="nm">2.</span><p><span class="cl">Answer:</span> Because the substitute Kohen is not segregated.</p></div>
<div class="indent1"><span class="nm">(g)</span><p><span class="cl">Answer #4:</span> Ribui Begadim and Meshichah during the seven days.</p></div>
<div class="indent2"><span class="nm">1.</span><p><span class="cl">Question:</span> Whence that these are normally not Me'akev?</p></div>
<div class="indent2"><span class="nm">2.</span><p><span class="cl">Answer:</span> The Beraisa learns it from "Asher Yimshach Oso va'Asher Yemalei Es Yado".</p></div>
<div class="indent2"><span class="nm">3.</span><p><span class="cl">Question:</span> Then whence that Meshichas Shivah is even a Mitzvah Lechatchilah?</p></div>
<div class="indent2"><span class="nm">4.</span><p><span class="cl">Answer #1:</span> The Pasuk in Tetzaveh links Meshichah to Ribui Begadim.</p></div>
<div class="indent1"><span class="nm">(h)</span><p><span class="cl">Question:</span> What is the reason for saying that all details of the Miluim are Me'akev?</p></div>
<div class="indent1"><span class="nm">(i)</span><p><span class="cl">Answer:</span> The word "Kachah" in Parshas Tetzaveh implies Ikuv.</p></div>
<div class="bbbline">5b----------------------------------------5b</p></div>
<div class="indent1"><span class="nm">(j)</span><p><span class="cl">Question:</span> But what about the details in Parshas Tzav where the word "Kachah" does not appear?</p></div>
<div class="indent1"><span class="nm">(k)</span><p><span class="cl">Answer #1:</span> A Gezeirah Shavah connects the two Parshios.</p></div>
<div class="indent1"><span class="nm">(l)</span><p><span class="cl">Answer #2:</span> "Mishmeres" in Parshas Tzav implies Ikuv.</p></div>
<div class="indent1"><span class="nm">(m)</span><p><span class="cl">Answer #3:</span> "Ki Chen Tziveisi" means that it is all l'Ikuva.</p></div>
<div class="indent2"><span class="nm">1.</span><p>The Beraisa explores the meaning of the repetition of "Tziveisi, Tziveisi" and "Tzivah Hash-m".</p></div>
<div class="indent2"><span class="nm">2.</span><p>The first, that the Korban should be eaten ba'Aninus; the second was the (erroneous) ruling in this case; the third was to indicate that this ruling is not in error, but rather the commandof Hash-m.</p></div>
<div class="indent1"><span class="nm">(n)</span><p>The Michnasayim and Asiris ha'Eifah are not written in the Parshah, but are included with a D'rashah.</p></div>
<div class="indent1"><span class="nm">(o)</span><p><span class="cl">Question:</span> Unlike the Michnasayim, Asiris ha'Eifah is not written here at all, so where do we learn it as an obligation during the Miluim</p></div>
<div class="indent1"><span class="nm">(p)</span><p><span class="cl">Answer:</span> Gezeirah Shavah from "Zeh Zeh".</p></div>
<div class="indent1"><span class="nm">(q)</span><p><span class="cl">Question:</span> Whence that even reading the Parshah is Me'akev?</p></div>
<div class="indent1"><span class="nm">(r)</span><p><span class="cl">Answer:</span> "ha'Davar Asher Tzivah Hash-m".</p></div>
<div class="subject"><span class="nm">3)</span><p>DONNING THE BIGDEI KEHUNAH</p></div>
<div class="indent1"><span class="nm">(a)</span><p><span class="cl">Question:</span> In what order did Moshe dress Aharon and his sons?</p></div>
<div class="indent1"><span class="nm">(b)</span><p><span class="cl">Answer:</span> Whatever was, was!</p></div>
<div class="indent1"><span class="nm">(c)</span><p><span class="cl">Question:</span> But how <i>will</i> the Kohanim be dressed?</p></div>
<div class="indent1"><span class="nm">(d)</span><p><span class="cl">Answer:</span> In the days to come we will see how Moshe dresses Aharon!!</p></div>
<div class="indent1"><span class="nm">(e)</span><p><span class="cl">Question:</span> We wish to know the order to understand the Pasuk.</p></div>
<div class="indent2"><span class="nm">1.</span><p>The Pesukim seem to contradict, were they dressed together or separately?</p></div>
<div class="indent2"><span class="nm">2.</span><p>It is a dispute whether he dressed Aharon first or both together.</p></div>
<div class="indent2"><span class="nm">3.</span><p><span class="cl">(Abaye):</span> The dispute is only regarding the Avnet.</p></div>
