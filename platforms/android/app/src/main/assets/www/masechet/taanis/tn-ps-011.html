<p class="bas subject"><span class="nm">1)</span>CONDUCT DURING FAMINE</p>
<p class="bas indent1"><span class="nm">(a)</span><span class="cl">(R. Yehudah citing Rav):</span> Anyone who deprives himself of food in years of famine is saved from unusual forms of death, as alluded to in a Pasuk.</p>
<p class="bas indent1"><span class="nm">(b)</span><span class="cl">(Resh Lakish):</span> It is forbidden to engage in marital relations during years of famine, as we see that Yosef only had children before the famine.</p>
<p class="bas indent1"><span class="nm">(c)</span><span class="cl">(Beraisa):</span> Childless people may engage in marital relations during famine.</p>
<p class="bas indent1"><span class="nm">(d)</span><span class="cl">(Beraisa):</span> If the community is in distress, and someone separates himself from them, his two escorting Malachim place their hands on his head and say that he will not live to see the salvation of the community.</p>
<p class="bas indent1"><span class="nm">(e)</span><span class="cl">(Beraisa):</span> When the community is in distress, a person should not say that he will go home, eat and enjoy his security.</p>
<p class="bas indent2"><span class="nm">1.</span>Concerning such people, who say "eat and drink for tomorrow we die," the Pasuk says that their sin is only cleansed through death.</p>
<p class="bas indent2"><span class="nm">2.</span>Such happens to people who at least acknowledge that they will die; but with wicked people who do not even admit to that, the Pasuk says that even Tzadikim will die.</p>
<p class="bas indent2"><span class="nm">3.</span>Rather, a person should afflict himself in sympathy with the troubles of the community.</p>
<p class="bas indent2"><span class="nm">4.</span>We find this with Moshe, who sat on a stone rather than on a chair, to show empathy with the plight of the Bnei Yisrael.</p>
<p class="bas indent1"><span class="nm">(f)</span>Anyone who afflicts himself along with the community merits seeing the salvation of the community.</p>
<p class="bas indent1"><span class="nm">(g)</span>A person need not be concerned about someone to testify about his doing so, as the Pasuk says that even his walls and ceiling-beams will testify.</p>
<p class="bas indent2"><span class="nm">1.</span><span class="cl">(D'bei R. Shila):</span> His two escorting Malachim testify for him.</p>
<p class="bas indent2"><span class="nm">2.</span><span class="cl">(R. Chidka):</span> His Neshamah testifies for him.</p>
<p class="bas indent2"><span class="nm">3.</span><span class="cl">(Others say):</span> His limbs testify for him.</p>
<p class="bas subject"><span class="nm">2)</span>REWARD AND PUNISHMENT</p>
<p class="bas indent1"><span class="nm">(a)</span>The Pasuk of "the G-d of integrity" means that just as Hash-m exacts retribution from Resha'im in the next world even for minor sins, He exacts retribution from Tzadikim in this world for minor sins.</p>
<p class="bas indent1"><span class="nm">(b)</span>"Without injustice" means that just as He rewards Tzadikim in the next world even for minor mitzvos, He also rewards Resha'im in this world for minor mitzvos.</p>
<p class="bas indent1"><span class="nm">(c)</span>"He is righteous and just" means that when a person dies, a complete account of his deeds is listed to him, and he admits to them, signs to them, and accepts the justice of the verdict.</p>
<p class="bas subject"><span class="nm">3)</span>THE VALUE OF FASTING</p>
<p class="bas indent1"><span class="nm">(a)</span><span class="cl">(Shmuel):</span> Anyone who fasts is called a sinner.</p>
<p class="bas indent1"><span class="nm">(b)</span>He holds like the Tana of the following Beraisa:</p>
<p class="bas indent2"><span class="nm">1.</span><span class="cl">(R. Elazar ha'Kafar citing Rebbi):</span> The Pasuk refers to the Nazir as having sinned, because he deprived himself from wine.</p>
<p class="bas indent2"><span class="nm">2.</span>If he is called a sinner just for abstaining from wine, how much more so someone who abstains from all food.</p>
<p class="bas indent1"><span class="nm">(c)</span><span class="cl">(R. Elazar):</span> The Pasuk calls him "holy."</p>
<p class="bas indent2"><span class="nm">1.</span>If he is called holy just for abstaining from wine, how much more so someone who abstains from all food.</p>
<p class="bas indent3"><span class="nm">i.</span><span class="cl">Question:</span> How does Shmuel account for the Pasuk calling him holy?</p>
<p class="bas indent3"><span class="nm">ii.</span><span class="cl">Answer:</span> That refers to his hair being forbidden for benefit.</p>
<p class="bas indent3"><span class="nm">iii.</span><span class="cl">Question:</span> How does R. Elazar account for the Pasuk saying that he has sinned?</p>
<p class="bas indent3"><span class="nm">iv.</span><span class="cl">Answer:</span> That refers to a Nazir who became Tamei.</p>
<p class="bas indent3"><span class="nm">v.</span><span class="cl">Question:</span> Surely R. Elazar said that a person should treat his insides as holy and not deprive them of anything!?</p>
<p class="bas bbbline">11b----------------------------------------11b</p>
<p class="bas indent3"><span class="nm">vi.</span><span class="cl">Answer:</span> That was referring to a person who finds fasting overly difficult.</p>
<p class="bas indent1"><span class="nm">(d)</span><span class="cl">(Resh Lakish):</span> Such a person is considered a Chasid.</p>
<p class="bas indent1"><span class="nm">(e)</span><span class="cl">(R. Sheshes):</span> A Talmid Chacham who fasts might as well be doing so because a dog ate his food.</p>
<p class="bas indent1"><span class="nm">(f)</span><span class="cl">(R. Yirmiyah bar Aba):</span> The extra restrictions of community fasts only apply in Bavel to Tish'ah b'Av.</p>
<p class="bas indent2"><span class="nm">1.</span><span class="cl">(Citing Resh Lakish):</span> A Talmid Chacham may not fast, as it detracts from his studies.</p>
<p class="bas subject"><span class="nm">4)</span>SPONTANEOUS FASTS</p>
<p class="bas indent1"><span class="nm">(a)</span><span class="cl">(R. Ze'ira citing R. Huna):</span> If an individual accepts a fast, even if he ate and drank all night, he says Aneinu the next day.</p>
<p class="bas indent1"><span class="nm">(b)</span>If he slept through the next night without eating, he does not say Aneinu on the next day.</p>
<p class="bas indent1"><span class="nm">(c)</span><span class="cl">Question (R. Yosef):</span> Does R. Huna hold that a spontaneous fast is invalid, or does he hold that a spontaneous fast is valid, but Aneinu is not said for it?</p>
<p class="bas indent1"><span class="nm">(d)</span><span class="cl">Answer (Abaye):</span> He holds that a spontaneous fast is valid and one <i>does</i> recite Aneinu for it; the difference here is that the fast was not declared in advance.</p>
<p class="bas indent1"><span class="nm">(e)</span>Mar Ukva was unable to answer the following questions in Ginzak:</p>
<p class="bas indent2"><span class="nm">1.</span>Is a spontaneous fast valid?</p>
<p class="bas indent2"><span class="nm">2.</span>Is a jug that has been used to store wine of non-Jews forbidden for usage?</p>
<p class="bas indent2"><span class="nm">3.</span>Which garments did Moshe wear while performing the initiation of the Mishkan?</p>
<p class="bas indent1"><span class="nm">(f)</span>At the Beis ha'Midrash, he was answered:</p>
<p class="bas indent2"><span class="nm">1.</span>A spontaneous fast is valid, and one says Aneinu.</p>
<p class="bas indent2"><span class="nm">2.</span>The jug is permitted for use after twelve months.</p>
<p class="bas indent2"><span class="nm">3.</span>Moshe wore a white linen robe.</p>
<p class="bas indent3"><span class="nm">i.</span><span class="cl">(R. Kahana):</span> He wore a white linen robe without a hem (to remove suspicion of theft).</p>
