<p class="bas subject"><span class="nm">1)</span>OTHER <i>TEME'IM</i> ARE EXCLUDED</p>
<p class="bas indent1"><span class="nm">(a)</span><span class="cl">Question:</span> How does R. Yosi expound the two times it says "Peter Chamor"?</p>
<p class="bas indent1"><span class="nm">(b)</span><span class="cl">Answer (Beraisa - R. Yosi) Suggestion:</span> "Ach Pado Sifdeh Es Bechor ha'Adam v'Es Bechor ha'Behemah ha'Teme'ah Tifdeh" - perhaps we redeem even firstborn horses and camels!</p>
<p class="bas indent2"><span class="nm">1.</span><span class="cl">Rejection:</span> We redeem "Peter Chamor", but not firstborn horses and camels.</p>
<p class="bas indent2"><span class="nm">2.</span><span class="cl">Suggestion:</span> Perhaps Kedushas Bechor applies to horses and camels, and the verse teaches that only a Peter Chamor can be redeemed through a Seh!</p>
<p class="bas indent2"><span class="nm">3.</span><span class="cl">Rejection:</span> The second "Peter Chamor" excludes other Tamei animals from any Kedushas Bechor.</p>
<p class="bas indent1"><span class="nm">(c)</span><span class="cl">Question (Rav Achai):</span> Had the Torah written it only once, one might have thought that Peter Chamor is a matter that was bi'Chlal (in the general category of Tamei animals) and it received a special law (Kedushas Bechor). The law applies to the entire Klal, including redemption with a Seh;</p>
<p class="bas indent2"><span class="nm">1.</span>Therefore, the second "Peter Chamor" should exclude other Teme'im from redemption with a Seh, but not from Kedushas Bechor!</p>
<p class="bas indent1"><span class="nm">(d)</span><span class="cl">Answer:</span> If so, it would have sufficed to repeat "Chamor Tifdeh b'Seh" without repeating "Peter";</p>
<p class="bas indent2"><span class="nm">1.</span>The extra "Peter" teaches that Kedushas Bechor does not apply to horses and camels.</p>
<p class="bas indent1"><span class="nm">(e)</span><span class="cl">Question:</span> What is our Tana's source to exclude them?</p>
<p class="bas indent1"><span class="nm">(f)</span><span class="cl">Answer (Rav Papa):</span> "V'Chol Miknecha Tizachar" is a Klal (general term). "Shor v'Seh v'Chamor" are Peratim (specific terms). From a Klal u'Ferat we only learn the Peratim.</p>
<p class="bas indent1"><span class="nm">(g)</span>R. Yosi argues. It says "u'Peter" in between "Shor v'Seh" and "Chamor". This separates (they are not part of the Klal u'Ferat).</p>
<p class="bas indent2"><span class="nm">1.</span><span class="cl">Chachamim:</span> The "Vav" ("<i>u</i>'Peter") connects it.</p>
<p class="bas indent2"><span class="nm">2.</span><span class="cl">R. Yosi:</span> If so, the Torah should not have written "Peter" nor the "Vav"!</p>
<p class="bas indent2"><span class="nm">3.</span><span class="cl">Chachamim:</span> The Torah says "Peter" to separate between Kedushas ha'Guf (something that it itself is used for Avodah) and Kedushas Damim (only its value is Kodesh). The "Vav" connects for the sake of the Klal u'Frat.</p>
<p class="bas subject"><span class="nm">2)</span>OFFSPRING UNLIKE THE MOTHER</p>
<p class="bas indent1"><span class="nm">(a)</span><span class="cl">Question #1:</span> If a cow gave birth to a donkey, and it resembles its mother in some ways, what is the law?</p>
<p class="bas indent2"><span class="nm">1.</span>If a sheep born to a goat (or vice-versa) resembles its mother in some ways, it has Kedushas Bechor because the child and mother are both Tehorim and both (can) receive Kedushas ha'Guf. Here, the mother is Tahor and can receive Kedushas ha'Guf, but the child is Tamei and can receive only Kedushas Damim;</p>
<p class="bas indent2"><span class="nm">2.</span>Or, since Kedushas Bechor applies to both mother and child, it becomes Kodesh!</p>
<p class="bas indent1"><span class="nm">(b)</span><span class="cl">Question #2:</span> If (in Question #1) it becomes Kodesh, what is the law of a horse born to a donkey?</p>
<p class="bas indent2"><span class="nm">1.</span>Kedushas Bechor does not apply to a horse. Surely it is not Kodesh;</p>
<p class="bas indent2"><span class="nm">2.</span>Or, since it is Tamei like its mother, it is Kodesh!</p>
<p class="bas indent1"><span class="nm">(c)</span><span class="cl">Question #3:</span> If (in Question #2) it becomes Kodesh, what is the law of a horse born to a cow?</p>
<p class="bas indent2"><span class="nm">1.</span>Kedushas Bechor does not apply to a horse. Surely it is not Kodesh;</p>
<p class="bas indent2"><span class="nm">2.</span>Or, resemblance is important! (It is always enough to cause Kedushas Bechor.)</p>
<p class="bas indent1"><span class="nm">(d)</span><span class="cl">Answer #1 (Beraisa):</span> If a Tahor animal gave birth to a Tamei animal, it is exempt from Bechorah;</p>
<p class="bas indent2"><span class="nm">1.</span>If it resembles its mother in some ways, Bechorah applies to it.</p>
<p class="bas indent2"><span class="nm">2.</span><span class="cl">Suggestion:</span> This applies even to a horse born to a cow (because resemblance is important. This answers all three questions.)</p>
<p class="bas indent1"><span class="nm">(e)</span><span class="cl">Partial rejection:</span> No, it applies only to a donkey born to a cow. (The Beraisa resolves only Question #1.)</p>
<p class="bas indent1"><span class="nm">(f)</span><span class="cl">Answer #2 (Beraisa):</span> If a cow gave birth to a donkey, or a donkey gave birth to a horse, it is exempt from Bechorah;</p>
<p class="bas indent2"><span class="nm">1.</span>If it resembles its mother in some ways, Bechorah applies to it.</p>
<p class="bas indent2"><span class="nm">2.</span><span class="cl">Suggestion:</span> This applies to both cases. (This answers Questions 1 and 2.)</p>
<p class="bas indent1"><span class="nm">(g)</span><span class="cl">Rejection:</span> No, it applies only to the first case.</p>
<p class="bas indent1"><span class="nm">(h)</span><span class="cl">Question:</span> If so, why does it teach about a horse born to a donkey?</p>
<p class="bas indent2"><span class="nm">1.</span>It is no Chidush that (without resemblance) it is exempt from Bechorah. Even a donkey born to a cow is exempt unless there is resemblance, even though Bechorah applies to both species!</p>
<p class="bas indent1"><span class="nm">(i)</span><span class="cl">Answer:</span> No, it is a Chidush;</p>
<p class="bas indent2"><span class="nm">1.</span>One might have thought that a donkey born to a cow is exempt because they are very different. A cow has horns and split hooves, but a donkey does not;</p>
<p class="bas indent2"><span class="nm">2.</span>Neither donkeys nor horses have horns or split hooves. A horse is just a red donkey;</p>
<p class="bas indent2"><span class="nm">3.</span>The Beraisa teaches that this is not so.</p>
<p class="bas indent1"><span class="nm">(j)</span><span class="cl">(Mishnah) Question:</span> May one eat them?</p>
<p class="bas indent1"><span class="nm">(k)</span><span class="cl">Question:</span> The Mishnah (permitted a Tamei born to a Tahor, and forbade a Tahor born to a Tamei, and then) says that what comes from Tamei is Tamei, and what comes from Tahor is Tahor. Why must it say this?</p>
<p class="bas indent1"><span class="nm">(l)</span><span class="cl">Answer:</span> The Tana gives a way to remember the law, lest one switch the laws, and say that it depends on the child;</p>
<p class="bas indent2"><span class="nm">1.</span>Rather, the Heter to eat depends on the mother.</p>
<p class="bas indent1"><span class="nm">(m)</span><span class="cl">Question:</span> What is the source of this?</p>
<p class="bas indent1"><span class="nm">(n)</span><span class="cl">Answer (Beraisa):</span> "Ach Es Zeh Lo Sochelu mi'Ma'alei ha'Gera umi'Mafrisei ha'Parsah" - there is an animal that chews the cud and has split hooves, yet one may not eat!</p>
<p class="bas indent2"><span class="nm">1.</span>This is a Tahor animal born to a Tamei animal.</p>
<p class="bas indent2"><span class="nm">2.</span><span class="cl">Suggestion:</span> Perhaps it is a Tamei born to a Tahor!</p>
<p class="bas indent3"><span class="nm">i.</span><span class="cl">Question:</span> If so, how would we explain "mi'Ma'alei ha'Gera umi'Mafrisei ha'Parsah"?</p>
<p class="bas bbbline">6b----------------------------------------6b</p>
<p class="bas indent3"><span class="nm">ii.</span><span class="cl">Answer:</span> It means 'do not eat a (Tamei) animal whose mother is Ma'aleh Gera and Mafris Parsah.'</p>
<p class="bas indent2"><span class="nm">3.</span><span class="cl">Rejection:</span> "Gamal Tamei Hu" - it is Tamei, but a Tamei born to a Tahor is Tahor.</p>
<p class="bas indent2"><span class="nm">4.</span>R. Shimon says "Gamal" is written (in Parshas Shemini) and repeated (in Parshas Re'eh), to forbid a camel born to a camel, and a camel born to a cow.</p>
<p class="bas indent1"><span class="nm">(o)</span><span class="cl">Question:</span> How do Chachamim expound "Gamal" and "Gamal"?</p>
<p class="bas indent1"><span class="nm">(p)</span><span class="cl">Answer:</span> One forbids a camel itself, and the other forbids its milk.</p>
<p class="bas subject"><span class="nm">3)</span>ONLY <i>TAHOR</i> MILK IS PERMITTED</p>
<p class="bas indent1"><span class="nm">(a)</span><span class="cl">Question:</span> What is R. Shimon's source to forbid its milk?</p>
<p class="bas indent1"><span class="nm">(b)</span><span class="cl">Answer:</span> He learns from "Es ha'Gamal."</p>
<p class="bas indent2"><span class="nm">1.</span>Chachamim do not expound "Es."</p>
<p class="bas indent2"><span class="nm">2.</span><span class="cl">(Beraisa):</span> Shimon ha'Amsoni used to expound every "Es" in the Torah (to include something). When he came to "<i>Es</i> Hash-m Elokecha Sira," he found nothing to include (to be feared like Hash-m).</p>
<p class="bas indent3"><span class="nm">i.</span><span class="cl">His Talmidim:</span> If so, nor should you expound "Es" in other places!</p>
<p class="bas indent3"><span class="nm">ii.</span><span class="cl">R. Shimon:</span> Indeed, I retract them all! Just like I will receive reward for what I expounded (at the time, I believed that it was true), I will be rewarded for retracting.</p>
<p class="bas indent2"><span class="nm">3.</span><span class="cl">R. Akiva:</span> "<i>Es</i> Hash-m Elokecha Sira" includes Talmidei Chachamim.</p>
<p class="bas indent1"><span class="nm">(c)</span><span class="cl">Question (Rav Acha):</span> Chachamim learn (to forbid camel milk) from "Gamal... Gamal." R. Shimon learns from "Es ha'Gamal." If not, we would permit;</p>
<p class="bas indent2"><span class="nm">1.</span>Why don't wet learn from Sheratzim (that what comes from something forbidden is forbidden)?</p>
<p class="bas indent2"><span class="nm">2.</span><span class="cl">(Beraisa):</span> "<i>Ha</i>'Teme'im" forbids their brine, soup (the water in which they were cooked), and Kipah (spices and shredded meat that accumulate at the bottom of the pot).</p>
<p class="bas indent1"><span class="nm">(d)</span><span class="cl">Answer #1:</span> We cannot learn from there;</p>
<p class="bas indent2"><span class="nm">1.</span>(All blood is forbidden, even menstrual blood of Tahor animals.) In a nursing animal, (what normally comes out as) menstrual blood is converted into milk. It is a Chidush that (even Tahor) milk is permitted;</p>
<p class="bas indent2"><span class="nm">2.</span>One might have thought that since a Chidush permits Tahor milk, also Tamei milk is permitted. The verse teaches that this is not so.</p>
<p class="bas indent1"><span class="nm">(e)</span><span class="cl">Question:</span> This is like the opinion (R. Meir) that a nursing woman (or animal) does not (normally) have Dam Nidah because it turns to milk;</p>
<p class="bas indent2"><span class="nm">1.</span>According to the opinion (R. Yosi) that it is because her limbs are perturbed by the birth, and do not return to normal until 24 months, how can we answer?</p>
<p class="bas indent1"><span class="nm">(f)</span><span class="cl">Answer:</span> Normally, anything that comes from a living being is forbidden. Since the Torah permits milk, one might have thought that it permits even milk of Teme'im. Therefore, the verse is needed.</p>
<p class="bas indent1"><span class="nm">(g)</span><span class="cl">Question:</span> What is the source that Tahor milk is permitted?</p>
<p class="bas indent1"><span class="nm">(h)</span><span class="cl">Answer #1:</span> The Torah forbids Basar b'Chalav (meat and milk cooked together). This implies that milk by itself is permitted.</p>
<p class="bas indent1"><span class="nm">(i)</span><span class="cl">Rejection #1:</span> Perhaps one may not drink milk, but one may benefit from it. Basar b'Chalav is Asur b'Hana'ah (one may not benefit from it)!</p>
<p class="bas indent2"><span class="nm">1.</span>This is unlike R. Shimon, who permits Hana'ah from Basar b'Chalav.</p>
<p class="bas indent1"><span class="nm">(j)</span><span class="cl">Rejection #2:</span> R. Shimon could forbid all milk, and explain that the verse of Basar b'Chalav is needed to forbid cooking them together.</p>
<p class="bas indent1"><span class="nm">(k)</span><span class="cl">Answer #2:</span> Rather, regarding Pesulei ha'Mukdashim (blemished Korbanos) it says "Tizbach (slaughter)" but do not shear them. (You may eat their) "Basar," but not milk;</p>
<p class="bas indent2"><span class="nm">1.</span><span class="cl">Inference:</span> Chulin milk is permitted.</p>
<p class="bas indent1"><span class="nm">(l)</span><span class="cl">Rejection:</span> Perhaps one may not drink Chulin milk, but one may benefit from it. Milk of Pesulei ha'Mukdashim is Asur b'Hana'ah!</p>
<p class="bas indent1"><span class="nm">(m)</span><span class="cl">Answer #3:</span> We learn from "v'Dei Chalev Izim l'Lachmecha l'Lechem Beisecha v'Chayim l'Na'arosecha" (that one may subsist on milk)!</p>
<p class="bas indent1"><span class="nm">(n)</span><span class="cl">Rejection:</span> Perhaps the verse teaches that one will sell the milk (to Nochrim)!</p>
<p class="bas indent1"><span class="nm">(o)</span><span class="cl">Answer #4:</span> "(David brought) v'Es Aseres Charitzei he'Chalav" (to the leader of 1000 men in the war. Surely, it may be eaten!)</p>
<p class="bas indent2"><span class="nm">1.</span><span class="cl">Question:</span> Perhaps he brought it to him to sell!</p>
<p class="bas indent2"><span class="nm">2.</span><span class="cl">Answer:</span> In war, one does not sell food to the enemy!</p>
<p class="bas indent1"><span class="nm">(p)</span><span class="cl">Answer #5:</span> Eretz Yisrael is called "Eretz Zavas Chalav u'Devash." It would not be praised for something forbidden to eat!</p>

<p class="bas indent1"><span class="nm">(r)</span><span class="cl">Question:</span> If we expound "Gamal... Gamal," we should also expound the repetitions of "Shafan," "Arneves" and "Chazir"!</p>
<p class="bas indent2"><span class="nm">1.</span>Rather, we must say that the entire Parshah was repeated for the following teaching:</p>
<p class="bas indent3"><span class="nm">i.</span><span class="cl">(Beraisa - Tana d'Vei R. Yishmael):</span> The Parshah of Tahor and Tamei animals was repeated (in Parshas Re'eh) due to Shesu'ah (a species or mutation that has two backs and two spines). The birds were repeated due to Ra'ah. (These were not mentioned in Parshas Shemini.)</p>
<p class="bas indent2"><span class="nm">2.</span>Also "Gamal" was repeated. We need not expound the repetition!</p>
<p class="bas indent1"><span class="nm">(s)</span><span class="cl">Answer:</span> Even when a Parshah is repeated for a Chidush, if we can expound other laws from some of the repetitions, we do so.</p>
<p class="bas subject"><span class="nm">4)</span>A NIDMEH</p>
<p class="bas indent1"><span class="nm">(a)</span><span class="cl">(Beraisa):</span> If a sheep gave birth to a goat (or vice-versa), it is exempt from Bechorah;</p>
<p class="bas indent1"><span class="nm">(b)</span>If it resembles its mother in some ways, it has Kedushas Bechor;</p>
<p class="bas indent1"><span class="nm">(c)</span>R. Shimon says, it is not Kodesh unless its head and majority resemble its mother.</p>
<p class="bas indent1"><span class="nm">(d)</span><span class="cl">Question:</span> Does R. Shimon require the head and majority to resemble its mother (or another Kosher animal) to permit eating it?</p>
<p class="bas indent2"><span class="nm">1.</span>Perhaps he requires the head and majority only regarding Bechorah, for it says "Ach Bechor Shor." A calf has Kedushas Bechor only if it and its mother are cattle, but one may eat it as long as it is not "Gamal" (even a small resemblance to a cow suffices);</p>
<p class="bas indent2"><span class="nm">2.</span>Or, perhaps he requires the same to eat?</p>
