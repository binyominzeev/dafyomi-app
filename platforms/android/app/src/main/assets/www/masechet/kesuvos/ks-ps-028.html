<p class="bas subject"><span class="nm">1)</span>KEEPING A DIVORCED COUPLE APART</p>
<p class="bas indent1"><span class="nm">(a)</span><span class="cl">Answer (Beraisa):</span> A divorcee may not get married (and live) in her ex-husband's neighborhood;</p>
<p class="bas indent2"><span class="nm">1.</span>If he is a Kohen, she may not live in the same Mavoy (alleyway, even if she did not remarry).</p>
<p class="bas indent2"><span class="nm">2.</span>A small village is considered like a neighborhood (Bach's text - Mavoy).</p>
<p class="bas indent1"><span class="nm">(b)</span><span class="cl">Question:</span> Which of them must move away from the other?</p>
<p class="bas indent1"><span class="nm">(c)</span><span class="cl">Answer (Beraisa):</span> She must move from him. He need not move from her unless it is her courtyard.</p>
<p class="bas indent1"><span class="nm">(d)</span><span class="cl">Question:</span> What is the law if they jointly own the courtyard?</p>
<p class="bas indent1"><span class="nm">(e)</span><span class="cl">Answer (Beraisa):</span> She must move from him.</p>
<p class="bas indent2"><span class="nm">1.</span>This cannot discuss his courtyard, for this would be obvious!</p>
<p class="bas indent2"><span class="nm">2.</span>It cannot discuss her courtyard, for then he must move!</p>
<p class="bas indent2"><span class="nm">3.</span><span class="cl">Suggestion:</span> We must say that they jointly own it!</p>
<p class="bas indent1"><span class="nm">(f)</span><span class="cl">Rejection:</span> Perhaps he is renting it.</p>
<p class="bas indent1"><span class="nm">(g)</span><span class="cl">Question:</span> What was the final ruling?</p>
<p class="bas indent1"><span class="nm">(h)</span><span class="cl">Answer:</span> Rav expounded "Hash-m will move you like a man moves" to teach that moving is harder for a man than for a woman.</p>
<p class="bas indent1"><span class="nm">(i)</span><span class="cl">(Beraisa):</span> If he (a Kohen) had borrowed things that she received from her father, she makes a Shali'ach to receive payment.</p>
<p class="bas indent1"><span class="nm">(j)</span><span class="cl">(Rav Sheshes):</span> If they come to Beis Din together, we do not accept their case.</p>
<p class="bas indent1"><span class="nm">(k)</span><span class="cl">(Rav Papa):</span> We excommunicate them.</p>
<p class="bas indent1"><span class="nm">(l)</span><span class="cl">(Rav Huna brei d'Rav Yehoshua):</span> We also lash them.</p>
<p class="bas indent1"><span class="nm">(m)</span><span class="cl">(Rav Nachman):</span> This applies to divorce from Nisu'in. If he divorced her from Eirusin he may pay her directly, since they are not intimate with each other.</p>
<p class="bas indent1"><span class="nm">(n)</span>A couple divorced from Eirusin came in front of Rava.</p>
<p class="bas indent1"><span class="nm">(o)</span><span class="cl">Version #1:</span> Rava set up a middleman, so they would not deal with each other.</p>
<p class="bas indent2"><span class="nm">1.</span><span class="cl">Rav Ada bar Masna:</span> Rav Nachman taught... !</p>
<p class="bas indent2"><span class="nm">2.</span><span class="cl">Rava:</span> I saw that they are intimate with each other.</p>
<p class="bas indent1"><span class="nm">(p)</span><span class="cl">Version #2:</span> Rava did not set up a middleman.</p>
<p class="bas indent2"><span class="nm">1.</span><span class="cl">Rav Ada bar Masna:</span> Set up a middleman!</p>
<p class="bas indent2"><span class="nm">2.</span><span class="cl">Rava:</span> But Rav Nachman taught... !</p>
<p class="bas indent2"><span class="nm">3.</span><span class="cl">Rav Ada:</span> That is when they are not intimate with each other. Here, we see that they are intimate.</p>
<p class="bas subject"><span class="nm">2)</span>WHEN ONE CAN TESTIFY ABOUT WHAT HE SAW AS A CHILD</p>
<p class="bas indent1"><span class="nm">(a)</span><span class="cl">(Mishnah):</span> A man may testify about the following things that he saw when he was a minor:</p>
<p class="bas indent2"><span class="nm">1.</span>This is the signature of my father, Rebbi or brother;</p>
<p class="bas indent2"><span class="nm">2.</span>When Plonis was married she went out with a Hinuma and uncovered hair (like the custom of virgins);</p>
<p class="bas indent2"><span class="nm">3.</span>When Ploni left school he would immerse in a Mikvah to eat Terumah;</p>
<p class="bas indent2"><span class="nm">4.</span>Ploni used to receive Terumah with us at the granaries;</p>
<p class="bas indent2"><span class="nm">5.</span>This area is a Beis ha'Pras (a field in which a plow may have scattered bones from a Mes);</p>
<p class="bas indent2"><span class="nm">6.</span>We used to walk this far on Shabbos (it is within the Techum in which one may walk);</p>
<p class="bas indent1"><span class="nm">(b)</span>One may not testify about seeing the following when he was a minor:</p>
<p class="bas indent2"><span class="nm">1.</span>Ploni owned a path to his field here;</p>
<p class="bas indent2"><span class="nm">2.</span>Ploni owned the place where they pause during funeral processions.</p>
<p class="bas indent1"><span class="nm">(c)</span><span class="cl">(Gemara - Rav Huna brei d'Rav Yehoshua):</span> He is believed only if an adult testifies with him. (Tosfos - this does not apply to Terumah.)</p>
<p class="bas indent1"><span class="nm">(d)</span>All three cases of signatures must be taught:</p>
<p class="bas indent2"><span class="nm">1.</span>Had it taught only that he is believed about his father's signature, we would have thought that he is not believed about others, since he is not with them as much.</p>
<p class="bas indent2"><span class="nm">2.</span>Had it taught only that he is believed about his Rebbi's signature, we would have thought that he is not believed about others, since he does not fear them as much.</p>
<p class="bas indent2"><span class="nm">3.</span>Had it taught only about his Rebbi and father, we would have thought that he is believed about their signatures because he fears him or is often with him, but he is not believed about his brother.</p>
<p class="bas indent2"><span class="nm">4.</span>Rather, since validation of documents is mid'Rabanan, Chachamim chose to believe him.</p>
<p class="bas indent1"><span class="nm">(e)</span><span class="cl">(Mishnah):</span> He is believed to say that Plonis went out with a Hinuma and uncovered hair.</p>
<p class="bas indent1"><span class="nm">(f)</span>Since most girls are virgins when they marry, this is a mere Giluy Milsa (proper testimony is not required).</p>
<p class="bas subject"><span class="nm">3)</span>ESTABLISHING A PERSON TO BE A <i>KOHEN</i></p>
<p class="bas indent1"><span class="nm">(a)</span><span class="cl">(Mishnah):</span> When Ploni left school he would immerse to eat Terumah.</p>
<p class="bas indent1"><span class="nm">(b)</span><span class="cl">Question:</span> Perhaps Ploni is a Kohen's slave!</p>
<p class="bas indent1"><span class="nm">(c)</span><span class="cl">Answer:</span> This supports R. Yehoshua ben Levi, who forbids teaching Torah to a slave.</p>
<p class="bas indent1"><span class="nm">(d)</span><span class="cl">Question:</span> Even so, this does not prove that he is not a slave!</p>
<p class="bas indent2"><span class="nm">1.</span><span class="cl">(Beraisa):</span> The following do not prove that a master freed his slave:</p>
<p class="bas indent3"><span class="nm">i.</span>The master borrowed money from his slave;</p>
<p class="bas indent3"><span class="nm">ii.</span>He made the slave an overseer on his property;</p>
<p class="bas bbbline">28b----------------------------------------28b</p>
<p class="bas indent3"><span class="nm">iii.</span>The slave put on Tefilin in front of the master or read three verses in the Beis ha'Keneses.</p>
<p class="bas indent1"><span class="nm">(e)</span><span class="cl">Answer:</span> There, the slave chose to do so. The master did not treat him like a son.</p>
<p class="bas indent1"><span class="nm">(f)</span><span class="cl">(Mishnah):</span> ...He would immerse to eat Terumah.</p>
<p class="bas indent1"><span class="nm">(g)</span>This testimony permits Ploni to eat Terumah mid'Rabanan.</p>
<p class="bas indent1"><span class="nm">(h)</span><span class="cl">(Mishnah):</span> Ploni used to receive a share of Terumah with us at the granaries.</p>
<p class="bas indent1"><span class="nm">(i)</span><span class="cl">Question:</span> Perhaps Ploni is a Kohen's slave!</p>
<p class="bas indent1"><span class="nm">(j)</span><span class="cl">Answer:</span> Our Tana holds that we do not give Terumah to a slave unless his master is there.</p>
<p class="bas indent2"><span class="nm">1.</span><span class="cl">(Beraisa - R. Yehudah):</span> (If a Kohen and his slave were mixed up at birth and we do not know who is the Kohen,) we do not give Terumah to a slave unless his master is there (i.e. they must come together to receive);</p>
<p class="bas indent2"><span class="nm">2.</span>R. Yosi says, either can receive alone. He receives for himself (if he is the Kohen) or for his master (if he is the slave).</p>
<p class="bas indent2"><span class="nm">3.</span>In R. Yehudah's area, receiving Terumah was a proof of proper lineage. In R. Yosi's area, it was not.</p>
<p class="bas indent1"><span class="nm">(k)</span><span class="cl">(Beraisa - R. Elazar b'Ribi Yosi):</span> I testified only once, and through my testimony a slave was established to be a Kohen!</p>
<p class="bas indent1"><span class="nm">(l)</span><span class="cl">Objection:</span> This cannot be! Hash-m does not allow a mishap to occur through a Tzadik's animal, all the more so through a Tzadik himself!</p>
<p class="bas indent1"><span class="nm">(m)</span><span class="cl">Correction:</span> They sought to establish a slave to be a Kohen through his testimony.</p>
<p class="bas indent2"><span class="nm">1.</span>He saw the slave receive Terumah in R. Yosi's area, and testified in R. Yehudah's area.</p>
<p class="bas subject"><span class="nm">4)</span>OTHER TESTIMONIES SEEN BY A CHILD</p>
<p class="bas indent1"><span class="nm">(a)</span><span class="cl">(Mishnah):</span> This area is a Beis ha'Pras.</p>
<p class="bas indent1"><span class="nm">(b)</span>He is believed because Beis ha'Pras is only a stringency mid'Rabanan.</p>
<p class="bas indent2"><span class="nm">1.</span><span class="cl">(Rav Yehudah):</span> A person may crouch down and blow on the dirt of a Beis ha'Pras and (if no bones are seen) walk across.</p>
<p class="bas indent2"><span class="nm">2.</span><span class="cl">(Rav Yehudah bar Ami):</span> A Beis ha'Pras which has been walked on greatly is Tahor.</p>
<p class="bas indent3"><span class="nm">i.</span>Any bone the size of a barley seed has surely been crushed (to less than this, so it is not Metamei).</p>
<p class="bas indent1"><span class="nm">(c)</span><span class="cl">(Mishnah):</span> We used to walk this far on Shabbos.</p>
<p class="bas indent1"><span class="nm">(d)</span>The Tana holds that the Isur to leave the Techum is only mid'Rabanan.</p>
<p class="bas indent1"><span class="nm">(e)</span><span class="cl">(Mishnah):</span> He is <i>not</i> believed to say that Ploni owned a path to his field here, or that Ploni owned the place where they pause during funeral processions.</p>
<p class="bas indent1"><span class="nm">(f)</span>This is because these cause a monetary loss to someone.</p>
<p class="bas indent1"><span class="nm">(g)</span><span class="cl">(Beraisa):</span> One is believed (after he matures) about the following things he remembers from when he was a minor:</p>
<p class="bas indent2"><span class="nm">1.</span>Father told me that this family is Tahor and this one is Tamei.</p>
<p class="bas indent3"><span class="nm">i.</span><span class="cl">Objection:</span> 'Tahor' and 'Tamei' do not apply to families!</p>
<p class="bas indent3"><span class="nm">ii.</span><span class="cl">Correction:</span> Rather, this family has proper lineage and this one does not.</p>
<p class="bas indent2"><span class="nm">2.</span>We ate at the Katzatzah (explained below) when Ploni's daughter married Ploni.</p>
<p class="bas indent2"><span class="nm">3.</span>We used to bring Chalah and Matanos (foreleg, jaw and stomach from a slaughtered Chulin animal) to Ploni the Kohen.</p>
<p class="bas indent3"><span class="nm">i.</span>He is believed only if he himself took them, but not if others took them.</p>
<p class="bas indent1"><span class="nm">(h)</span>In all these cases, a Nochri or slave who converted or was freed is not believed.</p>
<p class="bas indent1"><span class="nm">(i)</span>He is <i>not</i> believed to say that Ploni owned a path to his field here, or that Ploni owned the place where they pause during funeral processions;</p>
<p class="bas indent1"><span class="nm">(j)</span>R. Yochanan ben Berokah says, they are believed.</p>
<p class="bas indent1"><span class="nm">(k)</span><span class="cl">Question:</span> In which case(s) does R. Yochanan argue?</p>
<p class="bas indent2"><span class="nm">1.</span>It cannot be the last cases. These cause a monetary loss!</p>
<p class="bas indent1"><span class="nm">(l)</span><span class="cl">Answer:</span> Rather, he argues in the Reisha;</p>
<p class="bas indent2"><span class="nm">1.</span>The first Tana says that a Nochri or slave who converted or was freed is not believed, for he was not careful to observe precisely. R. Yochanan holds that since he planned to convert, he was precise.</p>
<p class="bas indent1"><span class="nm">(m)</span><span class="cl">Question:</span> What is Katzatzah?</p>
<p class="bas indent1"><span class="nm">(n)</span><span class="cl">Answer (Beraisa):</span> If a man married a woman of improper lineage, his family takes a barrel of produce and breaks it in the middle of the street;</p>
<p class="bas indent2"><span class="nm">1.</span>They say 'Hear, our brothers Yisrael! Our brother Ploni married a woman of improper lineage. We fear lest our seed will be mixed with his. Come take some produce for a commemoration, so our seeds will not get mixed.</p>
<p class="bas indent2"><span class="nm">2.</span>This is Katzatzah about which a child (after he matures) is believed.</p>
