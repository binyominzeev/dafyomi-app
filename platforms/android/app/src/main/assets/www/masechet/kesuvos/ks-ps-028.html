<div class="subject"><span class="nm">1)</span><p>KEEPING A DIVORCED COUPLE APART</p></div>
<div class="indent1"><span class="nm">(a)</span><p><span class="cl">Answer (Beraisa):</span> A divorcee may not get married (and live) in her ex-husband's neighborhood;</p></div>
<div class="indent2"><span class="nm">1.</span><p>If he is a Kohen, she may not live in the same Mavoy (alleyway, even if she did not remarry).</p></div>
<div class="indent2"><span class="nm">2.</span><p>A small village is considered like a neighborhood (Bach's text - Mavoy).</p></div>
<div class="indent1"><span class="nm">(b)</span><p><span class="cl">Question:</span> Which of them must move away from the other?</p></div>
<div class="indent1"><span class="nm">(c)</span><p><span class="cl">Answer (Beraisa):</span> She must move from him. He need not move from her unless it is her courtyard.</p></div>
<div class="indent1"><span class="nm">(d)</span><p><span class="cl">Question:</span> What is the law if they jointly own the courtyard?</p></div>
<div class="indent1"><span class="nm">(e)</span><p><span class="cl">Answer (Beraisa):</span> She must move from him.</p></div>
<div class="indent2"><span class="nm">1.</span><p>This cannot discuss his courtyard, for this would be obvious!</p></div>
<div class="indent2"><span class="nm">2.</span><p>It cannot discuss her courtyard, for then he must move!</p></div>
<div class="indent2"><span class="nm">3.</span><p><span class="cl">Suggestion:</span> We must say that they jointly own it!</p></div>
<div class="indent1"><span class="nm">(f)</span><p><span class="cl">Rejection:</span> Perhaps he is renting it.</p></div>
<div class="indent1"><span class="nm">(g)</span><p><span class="cl">Question:</span> What was the final ruling?</p></div>
<div class="indent1"><span class="nm">(h)</span><p><span class="cl">Answer:</span> Rav expounded "Hash-m will move you like a man moves" to teach that moving is harder for a man than for a woman.</p></div>
<div class="indent1"><span class="nm">(i)</span><p><span class="cl">(Beraisa):</span> If he (a Kohen) had borrowed things that she received from her father, she makes a Shali'ach to receive payment.</p></div>
<div class="indent1"><span class="nm">(j)</span><p><span class="cl">(Rav Sheshes):</span> If they come to Beis Din together, we do not accept their case.</p></div>
<div class="indent1"><span class="nm">(k)</span><p><span class="cl">(Rav Papa):</span> We excommunicate them.</p></div>
<div class="indent1"><span class="nm">(l)</span><p><span class="cl">(Rav Huna brei d'Rav Yehoshua):</span> We also lash them.</p></div>
<div class="indent1"><span class="nm">(m)</span><p><span class="cl">(Rav Nachman):</span> This applies to divorce from Nisu'in. If he divorced her from Eirusin he may pay her directly, since they are not intimate with each other.</p></div>
<div class="indent1"><span class="nm">(n)</span><p>A couple divorced from Eirusin came in front of Rava.</p></div>
<div class="indent1"><span class="nm">(o)</span><p><span class="cl">Version #1:</span> Rava set up a middleman, so they would not deal with each other.</p></div>
<div class="indent2"><span class="nm">1.</span><p><span class="cl">Rav Ada bar Masna:</span> Rav Nachman taught... !</p></div>
<div class="indent2"><span class="nm">2.</span><p><span class="cl">Rava:</span> I saw that they are intimate with each other.</p></div>
<div class="indent1"><span class="nm">(p)</span><p><span class="cl">Version #2:</span> Rava did not set up a middleman.</p></div>
<div class="indent2"><span class="nm">1.</span><p><span class="cl">Rav Ada bar Masna:</span> Set up a middleman!</p></div>
<div class="indent2"><span class="nm">2.</span><p><span class="cl">Rava:</span> But Rav Nachman taught... !</p></div>
<div class="indent2"><span class="nm">3.</span><p><span class="cl">Rav Ada:</span> That is when they are not intimate with each other. Here, we see that they are intimate.</p></div>
<div class="subject"><span class="nm">2)</span><p>WHEN ONE CAN TESTIFY ABOUT WHAT HE SAW AS A CHILD</p></div>
<div class="indent1"><span class="nm">(a)</span><p><span class="cl">(Mishnah):</span> A man may testify about the following things that he saw when he was a minor:</p></div>
<div class="indent2"><span class="nm">1.</span><p>This is the signature of my father, Rebbi or brother;</p></div>
<div class="indent2"><span class="nm">2.</span><p>When Plonis was married she went out with a Hinuma and uncovered hair (like the custom of virgins);</p></div>
<div class="indent2"><span class="nm">3.</span><p>When Ploni left school he would immerse in a Mikvah to eat Terumah;</p></div>
<div class="indent2"><span class="nm">4.</span><p>Ploni used to receive Terumah with us at the granaries;</p></div>
<div class="indent2"><span class="nm">5.</span><p>This area is a Beis ha'Pras (a field in which a plow may have scattered bones from a Mes);</p></div>
<div class="indent2"><span class="nm">6.</span><p>We used to walk this far on Shabbos (it is within the Techum in which one may walk);</p></div>
<div class="indent1"><span class="nm">(b)</span><p>One may not testify about seeing the following when he was a minor:</p></div>
<div class="indent2"><span class="nm">1.</span><p>Ploni owned a path to his field here;</p></div>
<div class="indent2"><span class="nm">2.</span><p>Ploni owned the place where they pause during funeral processions.</p></div>
<div class="indent1"><span class="nm">(c)</span><p><span class="cl">(Gemara - Rav Huna brei d'Rav Yehoshua):</span> He is believed only if an adult testifies with him. (Tosfos - this does not apply to Terumah.)</p></div>
<div class="indent1"><span class="nm">(d)</span><p>All three cases of signatures must be taught:</p></div>
<div class="indent2"><span class="nm">1.</span><p>Had it taught only that he is believed about his father's signature, we would have thought that he is not believed about others, since he is not with them as much.</p></div>
<div class="indent2"><span class="nm">2.</span><p>Had it taught only that he is believed about his Rebbi's signature, we would have thought that he is not believed about others, since he does not fear them as much.</p></div>
<div class="indent2"><span class="nm">3.</span><p>Had it taught only about his Rebbi and father, we would have thought that he is believed about their signatures because he fears him or is often with him, but he is not believed about his brother.</p></div>
<div class="indent2"><span class="nm">4.</span><p>Rather, since validation of documents is mid'Rabanan, Chachamim chose to believe him.</p></div>
<div class="indent1"><span class="nm">(e)</span><p><span class="cl">(Mishnah):</span> He is believed to say that Plonis went out with a Hinuma and uncovered hair.</p></div>
<div class="indent1"><span class="nm">(f)</span><p>Since most girls are virgins when they marry, this is a mere Giluy Milsa (proper testimony is not required).</p></div>
<div class="subject"><span class="nm">3)</span><p>ESTABLISHING A PERSON TO BE A KOHEN</p></div>
<div class="indent1"><span class="nm">(a)</span><p><span class="cl">(Mishnah):</span> When Ploni left school he would immerse to eat Terumah.</p></div>
<div class="indent1"><span class="nm">(b)</span><p><span class="cl">Question:</span> Perhaps Ploni is a Kohen's slave!</p></div>
<div class="indent1"><span class="nm">(c)</span><p><span class="cl">Answer:</span> This supports R. Yehoshua ben Levi, who forbids teaching Torah to a slave.</p></div>
<div class="indent1"><span class="nm">(d)</span><p><span class="cl">Question:</span> Even so, this does not prove that he is not a slave!</p></div>
<div class="indent2"><span class="nm">1.</span><p><span class="cl">(Beraisa):</span> The following do not prove that a master freed his slave:</p></div>
<div class="indent3"><span class="nm">i.</span><p>The master borrowed money from his slave;</p></div>
<div class="indent3"><span class="nm">ii.</span><p>He made the slave an overseer on his property;</p></div>
<div class="bbbline">28b----------------------------------------28b</p></div>
<div class="indent3"><span class="nm">iii.</span><p>The slave put on Tefilin in front of the master or read three verses in the Beis ha'Keneses.</p></div>
<div class="indent1"><span class="nm">(e)</span><p><span class="cl">Answer:</span> There, the slave chose to do so. The master did not treat him like a son.</p></div>
<div class="indent1"><span class="nm">(f)</span><p><span class="cl">(Mishnah):</span> ...He would immerse to eat Terumah.</p></div>
<div class="indent1"><span class="nm">(g)</span><p>This testimony permits Ploni to eat Terumah mid'Rabanan.</p></div>
<div class="indent1"><span class="nm">(h)</span><p><span class="cl">(Mishnah):</span> Ploni used to receive a share of Terumah with us at the granaries.</p></div>
<div class="indent1"><span class="nm">(i)</span><p><span class="cl">Question:</span> Perhaps Ploni is a Kohen's slave!</p></div>
<div class="indent1"><span class="nm">(j)</span><p><span class="cl">Answer:</span> Our Tana holds that we do not give Terumah to a slave unless his master is there.</p></div>
<div class="indent2"><span class="nm">1.</span><p><span class="cl">(Beraisa - R. Yehudah):</span> (If a Kohen and his slave were mixed up at birth and we do not know who is the Kohen,) we do not give Terumah to a slave unless his master is there (i.e. they must come together to receive);</p></div>
<div class="indent2"><span class="nm">2.</span><p>R. Yosi says, either can receive alone. He receives for himself (if he is the Kohen) or for his master (if he is the slave).</p></div>
<div class="indent2"><span class="nm">3.</span><p>In R. Yehudah's area, receiving Terumah was a proof of proper lineage. In R. Yosi's area, it was not.</p></div>
<div class="indent1"><span class="nm">(k)</span><p><span class="cl">(Beraisa - R. Elazar b'Ribi Yosi):</span> I testified only once, and through my testimony a slave was established to be a Kohen!</p></div>
<div class="indent1"><span class="nm">(l)</span><p><span class="cl">Objection:</span> This cannot be! Hash-m does not allow a mishap to occur through a Tzadik's animal, all the more so through a Tzadik himself!</p></div>
<div class="indent1"><span class="nm">(m)</span><p><span class="cl">Correction:</span> They sought to establish a slave to be a Kohen through his testimony.</p></div>
<div class="indent2"><span class="nm">1.</span><p>He saw the slave receive Terumah in R. Yosi's area, and testified in R. Yehudah's area.</p></div>
<div class="subject"><span class="nm">4)</span><p>OTHER TESTIMONIES SEEN BY A CHILD</p></div>
<div class="indent1"><span class="nm">(a)</span><p><span class="cl">(Mishnah):</span> This area is a Beis ha'Pras.</p></div>
<div class="indent1"><span class="nm">(b)</span><p>He is believed because Beis ha'Pras is only a stringency mid'Rabanan.</p></div>
<div class="indent2"><span class="nm">1.</span><p><span class="cl">(Rav Yehudah):</span> A person may crouch down and blow on the dirt of a Beis ha'Pras and (if no bones are seen) walk across.</p></div>
<div class="indent2"><span class="nm">2.</span><p><span class="cl">(Rav Yehudah bar Ami):</span> A Beis ha'Pras which has been walked on greatly is Tahor.</p></div>
<div class="indent3"><span class="nm">i.</span><p>Any bone the size of a barley seed has surely been crushed (to less than this, so it is not Metamei).</p></div>
<div class="indent1"><span class="nm">(c)</span><p><span class="cl">(Mishnah):</span> We used to walk this far on Shabbos.</p></div>
<div class="indent1"><span class="nm">(d)</span><p>The Tana holds that the Isur to leave the Techum is only mid'Rabanan.</p></div>
<div class="indent1"><span class="nm">(e)</span><p><span class="cl">(Mishnah):</span> He is <i>not</i> believed to say that Ploni owned a path to his field here, or that Ploni owned the place where they pause during funeral processions.</p></div>
<div class="indent1"><span class="nm">(f)</span><p>This is because these cause a monetary loss to someone.</p></div>
<div class="indent1"><span class="nm">(g)</span><p><span class="cl">(Beraisa):</span> One is believed (after he matures) about the following things he remembers from when he was a minor:</p></div>
<div class="indent2"><span class="nm">1.</span><p>Father told me that this family is Tahor and this one is Tamei.</p></div>
<div class="indent3"><span class="nm">i.</span><p><span class="cl">Objection:</span> 'Tahor' and 'Tamei' do not apply to families!</p></div>
<div class="indent3"><span class="nm">ii.</span><p><span class="cl">Correction:</span> Rather, this family has proper lineage and this one does not.</p></div>
<div class="indent2"><span class="nm">2.</span><p>We ate at the Katzatzah (explained below) when Ploni's daughter married Ploni.</p></div>
<div class="indent2"><span class="nm">3.</span><p>We used to bring Chalah and Matanos (foreleg, jaw and stomach from a slaughtered Chulin animal) to Ploni the Kohen.</p></div>
<div class="indent3"><span class="nm">i.</span><p>He is believed only if he himself took them, but not if others took them.</p></div>
<div class="indent1"><span class="nm">(h)</span><p>In all these cases, a Nochri or slave who converted or was freed is not believed.</p></div>
<div class="indent1"><span class="nm">(i)</span><p>He is <i>not</i> believed to say that Ploni owned a path to his field here, or that Ploni owned the place where they pause during funeral processions;</p></div>
<div class="indent1"><span class="nm">(j)</span><p>R. Yochanan ben Berokah says, they are believed.</p></div>
<div class="indent1"><span class="nm">(k)</span><p><span class="cl">Question:</span> In which case(s) does R. Yochanan argue?</p></div>
<div class="indent2"><span class="nm">1.</span><p>It cannot be the last cases. These cause a monetary loss!</p></div>
<div class="indent1"><span class="nm">(l)</span><p><span class="cl">Answer:</span> Rather, he argues in the Reisha;</p></div>
<div class="indent2"><span class="nm">1.</span><p>The first Tana says that a Nochri or slave who converted or was freed is not believed, for he was not careful to observe precisely. R. Yochanan holds that since he planned to convert, he was precise.</p></div>
<div class="indent1"><span class="nm">(m)</span><p><span class="cl">Question:</span> What is Katzatzah?</p></div>
<div class="indent1"><span class="nm">(n)</span><p><span class="cl">Answer (Beraisa):</span> If a man married a woman of improper lineage, his family takes a barrel of produce and breaks it in the middle of the street;</p></div>
<div class="indent2"><span class="nm">1.</span><p>They say 'Hear, our brothers Yisrael! Our brother Ploni married a woman of improper lineage. We fear lest our seed will be mixed with his. Come take some produce for a commemoration, so our seeds will not get mixed.</p></div>
<div class="indent2"><span class="nm">2.</span><p>This is Katzatzah about which a child (after he matures) is believed.</p></div>
