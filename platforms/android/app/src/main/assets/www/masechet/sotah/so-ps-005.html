<p class="bas subject"><span class="nm">1)</span>HAUGHTINESS (cont.)</p>
<p class="bas indent1"><span class="nm">(a)</span><span class="cl">Answer #3 (R. Yochanan):</span> Even if he gives Tzedakah discreetly, about which it says "a discreet gift subdues anger", he will not be exempt from punishment in Gehinom.</p>
<p class="bas indent1"><span class="nm">(b)</span><span class="cl">Question:</span> What verse warns not to be haughty?</p>
<p class="bas indent1"><span class="nm">(c)</span><span class="cl">Answer #1 (Rava):</span> "Listen, do not raise yourselves."</p>
<p class="bas indent1"><span class="nm">(d)</span><span class="cl">Answer #2 (Rav Nachman bar Yitzchak):</span> It says "your heart will rise and you will forget", and it says "beware, lest you forget Hash-m."</p>
<p class="bas indent2"><span class="nm">1.</span><span class="cl">(R. Avin):</span> Whenever the Torah says "beware", "lest", or "do not", this is a Lav.</p>
<p class="bas indent1"><span class="nm">(e)</span><span class="cl">(Rav Avira):</span> Anyone with haughtiness will eventually be diminished - "Rumo Me'at".</p>
<p class="bas indent2"><span class="nm">1.</span><span class="cl">Suggestion:</span> Perhaps he will remain in the world!</p>
<p class="bas indent2"><span class="nm">2.</span><span class="cl">Rejection:</span> "He will not be."</p>
<p class="bas indent1"><span class="nm">(f)</span>If he repents, he will die in his proper time, like Avraham - "They will be lowered, they will pass from the world like all";</p>
<p class="bas indent2"><span class="nm">1.</span>They will die like Avraham, Yitzchak and Yakov, about whom it says (respectively) "in all", "from all" and "all".</p>
<p class="bas indent1"><span class="nm">(g)</span>If he does not repent, "like the head of the ear (of grain) they will be cut."</p>
<p class="bas indent1"><span class="nm">(h)</span><span class="cl">Question:</span> What does it mean "like the head of the ear"?</p>
<p class="bas indent1"><span class="nm">(i)</span><span class="cl">Answer #1 (Rav Huna or Rav Chisda):</span> (They will be fall off like) the highest part of the ear.</p>
<p class="bas indent1"><span class="nm">(j)</span><span class="cl">Answer #2 (The other of Rav Huna or Rav Chisda):</span> (They will be cut off like) the ear itself.</p>
<p class="bas indent1"><span class="nm">(k)</span><span class="cl">Question:</span> According to the first opinion, we understand why it says "the head of the ear."</p>
<p class="bas indent2"><span class="nm">1.</span>According to the second opinion, why does it say "the head of the ear"?</p>
<p class="bas indent1"><span class="nm">(l)</span><span class="cl">Answer (Rav Asi):</span> This is a parable. One harvests the highest ears first. (Likewise, the haughty are the first to be taken from the world.)</p>
<p class="bas indent1"><span class="nm">(m)</span><span class="cl">(Rav Huna or Rav Chisda):</span> "(Hash-m is) with the crushed and lowly spirit" - the person is with Hash-m (Hash-m lifts him);</p>
<p class="bas indent1"><span class="nm">(n)</span><span class="cl">(The other of Rav Huna or Rav Chisda):</span> Hash-m is with the person (He lowers Himself).</p>
<p class="bas indent1"><span class="nm">(o)</span><span class="cl">Support (for the latter opinion):</span> Hash-m abandoned all the mountains and large hills and rested His presence on Har Sinai.</p>
<p class="bas indent1"><span class="nm">(p)</span><span class="cl">(R. Elazar):</span> Anyone with haughtiness is fitting to be cut down like an Asheirah (a tree plated for idolatry);</p>
<p class="bas indent2"><span class="nm">1.</span>It says "those of high stature are cut down", like it says "you will cut down their Asheiros."</p>
<p class="bas subject"><span class="nm">2)</span>WHAT HAPPENS TO HAUGHTY PEOPLE?</p>
<p class="bas indent1"><span class="nm">(a)</span><span class="cl">(R. Elazar):</span> If one has haughtiness, his dust will not move (at the time of revival of the dead).</p>
<p class="bas indent2"><span class="nm">1.</span>"Wake up and sing, Shecheinei Afar (those who dwell in soil)" - it does not say, 'those who lie in the soil', rather, those who were Shechenim (neighbors) to the soil in their lives.</p>
<p class="bas indent1"><span class="nm">(b)</span><span class="cl">(R. Elazar):</span> The Divine Presence laments over one who haughtiness - "one who is high, from afar He wails."</p>
<p class="bas indent1"><span class="nm">(c)</span><span class="cl">(Rav Avira):</span> Hash-m's ways are unlike human ways.</p>
<p class="bas indent2"><span class="nm">1.</span>Regarding people, the high see (care about) only the high. However, "Hash-m is exalted, and He sees the lowly."</p>
<p class="bas indent1"><span class="nm">(d)</span><span class="cl">(Rav Chisda):</span> Hash-m says that He cannot dwell in the world with a haughty person - "One who slanders his fellow man in private, him I will destroy. Haughty eyes and a wide heart, Oso (him) I cannot (bear)" - we read this "Ito (with him) I cannot be."</p>
<p class="bas indent2"><span class="nm">1.</span>Others say, this refers to those who speak badly of others, mentioned in the Reisha of the verse.</p>
<p class="bas indent1"><span class="nm">(e)</span><span class="cl">(R. Alexandri):</span> Even a tiny wind perturbs one with haughtiness - "the wicked (from context - the haughty) are cast out like the sea."</p>
<p class="bas indent2"><span class="nm">1.</span>The sea has many Revi'iyos, yet a tiny wind perturbs its waters. Man has only one Revi'is of blood, all the more so a tiny wind perturbs him!</p>
<p class="bas indent1"><span class="nm">(f)</span><span class="cl">(R. Chiya bar Aba):</span> A Chacham must have an eighth of an eighth of haughtiness. (Gra - this refers to the eighth verse of the eighth Parshah, "I (Yakov) became small from all the kindness and truth that You did for me.")</p>
<p class="bas indent2"><span class="nm">1.</span><span class="cl">(Rav Huna brei d'Rav Yehoshua):</span> This crowns him like the bristles on an ear of grain.</p>
<p class="bas indent2"><span class="nm">2.</span><span class="cl">(Rava):</span> One who has haughtiness should be excommunicated. The same applies to one who has none (he cannot rebuke people).</p>
<p class="bas indent1"><span class="nm">(g)</span><span class="cl">(Rav Nachman bar Yitzchak):</span> One should not have it, not even a little!</p>
<p class="bas indent2"><span class="nm">1.</span>"Anyone with haughtiness is an abomination to Hash-m."</p>
<p class="bas subject"><span class="nm">3)</span>HUMILITY</p>
<p class="bas indent1"><span class="nm">(a)</span><span class="cl">(Chizkiyah):</span> One's prayer is heard only if he makes his heart (soft) like flesh - "... all flesh will come to bow (pray)."</p>
<p class="bas indent1"><span class="nm">(b)</span><span class="cl">(R. Zeira):</span> When the Torah discusses Tzara'as in the flesh, it discusses being healed. When it discusses "Tzara'as in a person", it does not use the word 'healed.'</p>
<p class="bas indent1"><span class="nm">(c)</span><span class="cl">(R. Yochanan):</span> Adam is Notrikon (is composed of the initial letters) of Eifer (ashes), Dam (blood), Marah (bile);</p>
<p class="bas indent2"><span class="nm">1.</span><span class="cl">Version #1:</span> Basar (flesh) is Notrikon of Bushah (shame), Seruchah (putrid), Rimah (worm).</p>
<p class="bas indent2"><span class="nm">2.</span><span class="cl">Version #2:</span> Substitute She'ol (the pit, Gehinom) in place of putrid, for Basar is spelled with a Sin, not a Samech.</p>
<p class="bas indent1"><span class="nm">(d)</span><span class="cl">(Rav Ashi):</span> Anyone with haughtiness is ultimately lowered - "vela'Se'eis vela'Sapachas" (these are appearances of Tzara'as)";</p>
<p class="bas bbbline">5b----------------------------------------5b</p>
<p class="bas indent2"><span class="nm">1.</span>Se'eis refers to highness; Sapachas means secondary.</p>
<p class="bas indent1"><span class="nm">(e)</span><span class="cl">(R. Yehoshua ben Levi):</span> The humble are very important to Hash-m. When the Mikdash stands, one gets reward only for the Korbanos he brings;</p>
<p class="bas indent2"><span class="nm">1.</span>A verse considers it as if a humble person brought all the Korbanos - "the Korbanos of Hash-m are a broken spirit."</p>
<p class="bas indent1"><span class="nm">(f)</span>Also, his prayer is not despised - "Hash-m will not despise a broken heart."</p>
<p class="bas indent1"><span class="nm">(g)</span><span class="cl">(R. Yehoshua ben Levi):</span> Anyone who sets his ways in this world merits to see Hash-m's salvation in the next world - "I will show My salvation to one who sets his way."</p>
<p class="bas subject"><span class="nm">4)</span>WHAT CONSTITUTES WARNING?</p>
<p class="bas indent1"><span class="nm">(a)</span><span class="cl">(Mishnah):</span> How does he warn her? (He tells her not to speak with Ploni...)</p>
<p class="bas indent1"><span class="nm">(b)</span><span class="cl">Inference:</span> This shows that speaking has the same law as (Rashi; Tosfos - is a euphemism for) seclusion;</p>
<p class="bas indent1"><span class="nm">(c)</span><span class="cl">Contradiction (Seifa):</span> If she spoke with him, she is still permitted to her husband and Terumah.</p>
<p class="bas indent2"><span class="nm">1.</span>This shows that speaking is unlike seclusion!</p>
<p class="bas indent1"><span class="nm">(d)</span><span class="cl">Answer (Abaye):</span> The Mishnah means as follows. If he told her not to speak, and she spoke or was in seclusion, or if he warned her not to be in seclusion, and she spoke with him, she is still permitted to her husband and to Terumah;</p>
<p class="bas indent2"><span class="nm">1.</span>If (after a warning about seclusion) she was secluded with Ploni, she is forbidden to her husband and to Terumah.</p>
<p class="bas subject"><span class="nm">5)</span>A SOTAH DOES CHALITZAH</p>
<p class="bas indent1"><span class="nm">(a)</span><span class="cl">(Mishnah):</span> If her husband dies, she does Chalitzah, not Yibum.</p>
<p class="bas indent1"><span class="nm">(b)</span><span class="cl">Question:</span> Why can't she do Yibum?</p>
<p class="bas indent1"><span class="nm">(c)</span><span class="cl">Version #1 - Answer #1 (Rav Yosef):</span> "She will leave his house and be to another man" - to another, not to the Yavam.</p>
<p class="bas indent2"><span class="nm">1.</span><span class="cl">Question (Abaye):</span> If so, she should not even need Chalitzah!</p>
<p class="bas indent2"><span class="nm">2.</span><span class="cl">Answer (Rav Yosef):</span> If the husband were alive, she would need a Get (document of divorce). Now that the husband is dead, she needs Chalitzah.</p>
<p class="bas indent1"><span class="nm">(d)</span><span class="cl">Version #2 - Answer #1 (Rav Yosef):</span> "She will leave his house and be to another man", lest she wreck her (first) husband's house. You cannot say that she will do Yibum!</p>
<p class="bas indent2"><span class="nm">1.</span><span class="cl">Question (Abaye):</span> If so, she should not marry another man, lest she wreck his house!</p>
