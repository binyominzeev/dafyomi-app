<div class="subject"><span class="nm">1)</span><p>THE ORDER OF THE PARSHIYOS</p></div>
<div class="indent1"><span class="nm">(a)</span><p><span class="cl">(Rav Chananel):</span> If the Parshiyos were put in a different order, they are Pesulim.</p></div>
<div class="indent1"><span class="nm">(b)</span><p><span class="cl">(Abaye):</span> This is only if a Parshah that should be on the outside (extreme left or right) is on the inside, but if the outside Parshiyos were switched (with each other), or the inside ones were switched, it is Kosher.</p></div>
<div class="indent1"><span class="nm">(c)</span><p><span class="cl">Objection (Rava):</span> Presumably, you disqualify when an outside Parshah was switched with an inside one, because a Parshah that should be 'exposed' is not exposed (and vice-versa);</p></div>
<div class="indent2"><span class="nm">1.</span><p>Likewise, when the outside Parshiyos are switched with each other, the Parshah that should be 'exposed' to the right is not exposed to the right (and vice-versa)!</p></div>
<div class="indent2"><span class="nm">2.</span><p>Rather, in either case it is Pasul. (Ma'adanei Yom Tov (under the Rosh) - when the inside Parshiyos are switched it is Pasul, for the Parshah that should be next to the Parshah exposed to the right is not next to it.)</p></div>
<div class="subject"><span class="nm">2)</span><p>HALACHOS L'MOSHE MI'SINAI ABOUT TEFILIN</p></div>
<div class="indent1"><span class="nm">(a)</span><p><span class="cl">(Rav Chananel):</span> The Titura (the base of the Tefilin, it covers the opening of the Batim) is a tradition from Moshe from Sinai.</p></div>
<div class="indent1"><span class="nm">(b)</span><p><span class="cl">(Abaye):</span> The Ma'avarta (an extension of the Titura; the strap passes through it) is a tradition from Sinai.</p></div>
<div class="indent1"><span class="nm">(c)</span><p><span class="cl">(Abaye):</span> The 'Shin' (on the outside of the head Tefilin) is a tradition from Sinai;</p></div>
<div class="indent2"><span class="nm">1.</span><p>The crack between the Batim must reach to the stitches (of the Titura.)</p></div>
<div class="indent1"><span class="nm">(d)</span><p><span class="cl">(Rav Dimi of Neharda'a):</span> As long as the crack is visible at the top, it need not reach to the stitches.</p></div>
<div class="indent1"><span class="nm">(e)</span><p><span class="cl">(Abaye):</span> One must check the Klaf, lest it has a hole. (If this is in a letter,) this is not 'Kesivah Tamah (faultless)';</p></div>
<div class="indent1"><span class="nm">(f)</span><p><span class="cl">(Rav Dimi of Neharda'a):</span> It need not be checked. The scribe would have felt it when writing over it.</p></div>
<div class="indent1"><span class="nm">(g)</span><p><span class="cl">(R. Yitzchak):</span> A tradition from Sinai requires the straps to be black.</p></div>
<div class="indent1"><span class="nm">(h)</span><p><span class="cl">Question (Beraisa):</span> Tefilin must be tied with their own material (i.e. hide), whether the straps are yellow, black or white;</p></div>
<div class="indent2"><span class="nm">1.</span><p>Red straps may not be used, due to disgrace and another reason. (People will suspect that his wife sat on them when she was Nidah.)</p></div>
<div class="indent2"><span class="nm">2.</span><p>R. Yehudah says, a Talmid of R. Akiva used (woolen) Techeles strings (in place of straps). R. Akiva did not say anything;</p></div>
<div class="indent3"><span class="nm">i.</span><p>Surely, a Tzadik who saw his Talmid transgress would protest!</p></div>
<div class="indent2"><span class="nm">3.</span><p><span class="cl">Rabanan:</span> R. Akiva did not see the strings. Had he seen them, he would have protested!</p></div>
<div class="indent2"><span class="nm">4.</span><p><span class="cl">R. Yehudah:</span> Hurkanos (the son of R. Eliezer) used Argamon strings. R. Eliezer did not say anything;</p></div>
<div class="indent3"><span class="nm">i.</span><p>Surely, a Tzadik who saw his son transgress would protest!</p></div>
<div class="indent2"><span class="nm">5.</span><p><span class="cl">Rabanan:</span> R. Eliezer did not see the strings. Had he seen them, he would have protested!</p></div>
<div class="indent2"><span class="nm">6.</span><p><span class="cl">Summation of question:</span> It says that the straps are yellow, black or white.</p></div>
<div class="indent1"><span class="nm">(i)</span><p><span class="cl">Answer:</span> R. Yitzchak requires the (side of the straps that face) outside to be black. The Beraisa permits the inside to be yellow, black or white.</p></div>
<div class="indent1"><span class="nm">(j)</span><p><span class="cl">Question (Beraisa):</span> ...Due to disgrace and another reason.</p></div>
<div class="indent2"><span class="nm">1.</span><p>Other people do not see the inside. There is no disgrace or suspicion!</p></div>
<div class="indent1"><span class="nm">(k)</span><p><span class="cl">Answer:</span> Sometimes the straps flip over, and the inside faces out.</p></div>
<div class="indent1"><span class="nm">(l)</span><p><span class="cl">(Beraisa):</span> A tradition from Sinai requires Tefilin to be square.</p></div>
<div class="indent1"><span class="nm">(m)</span><p><span class="cl">(Rav Papa):</span> The stitching must be square, and also the diagonals (i.e. the sides be equal, and also perpendicular to each other. Tosfos leans to say that we are concerned only for the base.)</p></div>
<div class="indent1"><span class="nm">(n)</span><p><span class="cl">Support (Mishnah):</span> If one makes his Tefilin round, it is dangerous to wear them. (Rashi - if he bangs his head, it might enter his head; Tosfos (Megilah 24b) - when Nochrim decree against Tefilin, he will not be protected, for) he does not fulfill the Mitzvah.</p></div>
<div class="indent1"><span class="nm">(o)</span><p><span class="cl">Rejection (Rav Papa):</span> Perhaps that refers to oval Tefilin, but circular Tefilin are Kosher!</p></div>
<div class="subject"><span class="nm">3)</span><p>HALACHOS OF THE BATIM</p></div>
<div class="indent1"><span class="nm">(a)</span><p><span class="cl">(Rav Huna):</span> Tefilin are Kosher as long as the leather of the Batim is intact (without a hole).</p></div>
<div class="indent1"><span class="nm">(b)</span><p><span class="cl">(Rav Chisda):</span> If two of the Batim are torn, the Tefilin are Kosher. If three are torn, they are Pasul.</p></div>
<div class="indent1"><span class="nm">(c)</span><p><span class="cl">(Rava):</span> We are Machshir when two Batim are torn only if the two Batim (alternatively - tears) are not adjacent to each other;</p></div>
<div class="indent2"><span class="nm">1.</span><p><span class="cl">Version #1 (Rashi):</span> Even when they are adjacent, they are Pasul only if the Tefilin are new. (This shows that the leather is defective.)</p></div>
<div class="indent2"><span class="nm">2.</span><p><span class="cl">Version #2 (Rif):</span> Even when they are adjacent, they are Pasul only if the Tefilin are old. (Nimukei Yosef - perhaps they will tear more.)</p></div>
<div class="indent1"><span class="nm">(d)</span><p><span class="cl">Question (Abaye):</span> What is considered old, and what is new?</p></div>
<div class="indent1"><span class="nm">(e)</span><p><span class="cl">Answer #1 (Rav Yosef):</span> If when one pulls the leather taut and lets go it shrivels up again, it is old. If not, it is new.</p></div>
<div class="bbbline">35b----------------------------------------35b</p></div>
<div class="indent1"><span class="nm">(f)</span><p><span class="cl">Answer #2:</span> If when one pulls the strap (it does not snap, rather,) the Tefilin is drawn after it (alternatively - it straightens out), it is new. If not, it is old.</p></div>
<div class="subject"><span class="nm">4)</span><p>HALACHOS OF THE STRAPS</p></div>
<div class="indent1"><span class="nm">(a)</span><p>A strap of Abaye's Tefilin snapped. He asked Rav Yosef if he may tie the parts together.</p></div>
<div class="indent1"><span class="nm">(b)</span><p><span class="cl">(Rav Yosef):</span> "U'Kshartam" - the tying (on the arm) must be Tam (pure, without any other knots. Alternatively, the strap must be flawless.)</p></div>
<div class="indent1"><span class="nm">(c)</span><p><span class="cl">Question (Rav Acha brei d'Rav Yosef):</span> May one sew it so that the stitching is inside (it appears unbroken?)</p></div>
<div class="indent1"><span class="nm">(d)</span><p><span class="cl">(Rav Ashi):</span> Go see what people do. (They do not do so. Also you should not do so.)</p></div>
<div class="indent1"><span class="nm">(e)</span><p><span class="cl">(Rav Papa):</span> Remnants of straps are Kosher.</p></div>
<div class="indent1"><span class="nm">(f)</span><p>This is wrong, for Bnei R. Chiya taught that remnants of Techeles and Ezov (for sprinkling Mei Chatas) are Kosher;</p></div>
<div class="indent2"><span class="nm">1.</span><p><span class="cl">Inference:</span> Remnants are Kosher only for things used for Mitzvos, but not for straps, which are used for Kedushah. (Tefilin contain Kisvei ha'Kodesh, which are more stringent.)</p></div>
<div class="indent1"><span class="nm">(g)</span><p><span class="cl">Question:</span> If remnants are Pasul, this implies that there is a minimum Shi'ur. What is the Shi'ur?</p></div>
<div class="indent1"><span class="nm">(h)</span><p><span class="cl">Version #1 - Answer (Rami bar Chama):</span> The Shi'ur (of how much the strap of the Shel Rosh must extend past the knot) is (from another finger) until the Etzba Tzredah (Rashi - the index finger; Tosfos - the middle finger).</p></div>
<div class="indent1"><span class="nm">(i)</span><p><span class="cl">(Rav Kahana):</span> He refers to a small span. We measure to the middle finger (Rashi; Tosfos - to the index finger);</p></div>
<div class="indent1"><span class="nm">(j)</span><p><span class="cl">(Rav Ashi):</span> He refers to a large span. We measure to the thumb.</p></div>
<div class="indent1"><span class="nm">(k)</span><p><span class="cl">Version #2 (brought in Tosfos) - Answer (Rami bar Chama):</span> The Shi'ur (of how far the strap of the Shel Yad must extend) is (from where it is tied in the arm) until the middle finger.</p></div>
<div class="indent1"><span class="nm">(l)</span><p><span class="cl">(Rav Kahana):</span> This is when it is bent;</p></div>
<div class="indent1"><span class="nm">(m)</span><p><span class="cl">(Rav Ashi):</span> This is when it is extended.</p></div>
<div class="indent1"><span class="nm">(n)</span><p>Rabah would tie the Shel Rosh and hang the excess strap over his back;</p></div>
<div class="indent1"><span class="nm">(o)</span><p>Rav Acha bar Yakov would braid them. (He had long straps.)</p></div>
<div class="indent1"><span class="nm">(p)</span><p>Mar brei d'Ravina would do as we do. (He hung the excess strap over his chest.)</p></div>
<div class="indent1"><span class="nm">(q)</span><p><span class="cl">(Rav Yehudah brei d'Rav Shmuel):</span> A tradition from Moshe from Sinai teaches about the knot. (Rashi - the letters 'Dalet' and 'Yud' (of Hash-m's name Shakai) should appear in the knots on the Shel Rosh and Yad respectively).</p></div>
<div class="indent2"><span class="nm">1.</span><p><span class="cl">(Rav Nachman):</span> Their beauty (the letters; alternatively, the smooth side of the straps, which must be black) must face outside.</p></div>
<div class="indent1"><span class="nm">(r)</span><p>Rav Ashi's straps became flipped over.</p></div>
<div class="indent2"><span class="nm">1.</span><p><span class="cl">Mar Zutra:</span> Don't you agree that their beauty must face outside?!</p></div>
<div class="indent2"><span class="nm">2.</span><p><span class="cl">Rav Ashi:</span> I didn't realize that they were flipped over.</p></div>
<div class="indent1"><span class="nm">(s)</span><p><span class="cl">(Beraisa - R. Eliezer ha'Gadol):</span> "V'Ra'u Kol Amei ha'Aretz Ki Shem Hash-m Nikra Alecha v'Yar'u Mimeka" refers to the Shel Rosh. (Rashi - a 'Shin' and 'Dalet' are seen from the outside. This is most of a name of Hash-m.)</p></div>
<div class="subject"><span class="nm">5)</span><p>PUTTING ON TEFILIN</p></div>
<div class="indent1"><span class="nm">(a)</span><p><span class="cl">(Rav Chana bar Bizna):</span> "V'Hasirosi Es Kapi v'Ra'isa Es Achorai" - Hash-m allowed Moshe to see the knot of His Tefilin.</p></div>
<div class="indent1"><span class="nm">(b)</span><p><span class="cl">(Rav Yehudah):</span> The knot must be high, for a sign that Yisrael will be supreme, and not below. It must face (be opposite) the face, for a sign that Yisrael will be in front, and not in back.</p></div>
<div class="indent1"><span class="nm">(c)</span><p><span class="cl">(Rav Shmuel bar Bidri):</span> We bless on Tefilin (the Shel Yad) after putting them on.</p></div>
<div class="indent1"><span class="nm">(d)</span><p><span class="cl">Question:</span> Rav Yehudah taught that we always bless on a Mitzvah before doing the Mitzvah!</p></div>
<div class="indent1"><span class="nm">(e)</span><p><span class="cl">Answer (Abaye and Rava):</span> He means that we bless after putting it on and before tying it. (Tying is the completion of the Mitzvah.)</p></div>
