<p class="bas subject"><span class="nm">1)</span><i>ONES</i> DOES NOT COUNT IN GITIN</p>
<p class="bas indent1"><span class="nm">(a)</span>Mid'Oraisa, if a Tnai was fulfilled due to Ones, the Get is invalid;</p>
<p class="bas indent2"><span class="nm">1.</span>Righteous women might refrain from remarrying, from concern lesthat there was an Ones, and the Get is invalid;</p>
<p class="bas indent2"><span class="nm">2.</span>Immoral women might deny that there was an Ones, even when they have heard or know that there was. They will remarry, and their children will be Mamzerim (bastards, who cannot marry those of legitimate lineage).</p>
<p class="bas indent2"><span class="nm">3.</span>To prevent both of these concerns, Chachamim decreed that in a case of Ones, the Get is valid.</p>
<p class="bas indent1"><span class="nm">(b)</span><span class="cl">Question:</span> If the Torah disqualifiesays that the Get is invalid, can Chachamim decree that it is valid, and permit a married woman to remarry?</p>
<p class="bas indent1"><span class="nm">(c)</span><span class="cl">Answer:</span> Yes! Everyone who is Mekadesh stipulates that the marriage should be like Chachamim desire. In this case, Chachamim uproot the marriage.</p>
<p class="bas indent1"><span class="nm">(d)</span><span class="cl">Question: (Ravina):</span> This is understandable for one who was Mekadesh with money (the Kidushin is uprooted, and the money is a gift);</p>
<p class="bas indent2"><span class="nm">1.</span>If he was Mekadesh with Bi'ah, how can we uproot it?</p>
<p class="bas indent1"><span class="nm">(e)</span><span class="cl">Answer (Rav Ashi):</span> The marriage is uprooted. Retroactively, the Bi'ah was Znus (harlotry).</p>
<p class="bas indent1"><span class="nm">(f)</span><span class="cl">Version #2 (Rava):</span> Also regarding Gitin, Ones exempts (i.e. the Get is invalid).</p>
<p class="bas indent1"><span class="nm">(g)</span><span class="cl">Question #1 (Mishnah):</span> If he said 'Tthis is your Get if I don't come within a year' and he died during the year, the Get is invalid.</p>
<p class="bas indent2"><span class="nm">1.</span><span class="cl">Inference:</span> If he got sick, the Get is valid!</p>
<p class="bas indent1"><span class="nm">(h)</span><span class="cl">Answer #1:</span> Even if he got sick, the Get is invalid. The Mishnah teaches that a Get cannot take effect after death.</p>
<p class="bas indent1"><span class="nm">(i)</span><span class="cl">Objection:</span> The Reisha already taught this!</p>
<p class="bas indent1"><span class="nm">(j)</span><span class="cl">Answer #2:</span> Rather, the Seifa teaches unlike Raboseinu. (We cannot infer that if he got sick the Get is valid.)</p>
<p class="bas indent1"><span class="nm">(k)</span><span class="cl">QuestionAnswer #2 (to Question (b) - Seifa):</span> If he said 'Tthis Get should take effect from now if I don't come within a year' and he died during the year, the Get is valid.</p>
<p class="bas indent2"><span class="nm">1.</span><span class="cl">Inference:</span> Also if he got sick, the Get is valid!</p>
<p class="bas indent1"><span class="nm">(l)</span><span class="cl">Rejection:</span> Perhaps the Get is valid only if he dies, since his intent was that his wife should not fall to Yibum.</p>
<p class="bas indent1"><span class="nm">(m)</span><span class="cl">Answer #3:</span> A case occurred in which a man gave a Get on condition that he will not return within 30 days. He was returning on the 30th day, but was delayed because the ferry was on the other side. Even though he was trying to return, Shmuel ruled that the Get is valid.</p>
<p class="bas indent1"><span class="nm">(n)</span><span class="cl">Rejection:</span> Perhaps a common Ones is different. Since he should have stipulated what will be in such a case, but neglected to do so, he accepted on himself whatever will happen.</p>
<p class="bas subject"><span class="nm">2)</span>THE DAYS TO GET MARRIED</p>
<p class="bas indent1"><span class="nm">(a)</span><span class="cl">(Rav Shmuel bar Yitzchak):</span> Our Mishnah, which says that a virgin is married on Wednesday, applies after Ezra decreed that Beis Din meet every Monday and Thursday;</p>
<p class="bas indent2"><span class="nm">1.</span>Before Ezra, a virgin could be married on any day.</p>
<p class="bas indent1"><span class="nm">(b)</span><span class="cl">Question:</span> Why did he teach this - it has no relevance today!</p>
<p class="bas indent1"><span class="nm">(c)</span><span class="cl">Answer:</span> If Beis Dins would again meet equally all days of the week, a virgin may be married on any day.</p>
<p class="bas indent1"><span class="nm">(d)</span><span class="cl">Question:</span> We require the Chasan to prepare the feast for three days!</p>
<p class="bas indent1"><span class="nm">(e)</span><span class="cl">Answer:</span> We discuss a case in which he prepared.</p>
<p class="bas bbbline">3b----------------------------------------3b</p>
<p class="bas indent1"><span class="nm">(f)</span><span class="cl">(Beraisa):</span> A virgin is married on Wednesday, so if the Chasan finds that she is not a virgin, he will go to Beis Din the next day.</p>
<p class="bas indent1"><span class="nm">(g)</span><span class="cl">Question:</span> If the marriage is on Sunday, he could also go to Beis Din the next day!</p>
<p class="bas indent1"><span class="nm">(h)</span><span class="cl">Answer:</span> Chachamim deliberated to help the Kalah, so that the Chasan will exert for three days preparing the Chupah meal.</p>
<p class="bas subject"><span class="nm">3)</span>WHAT HAPPENS WHEN THERE IS DANGER</p>
<p class="bas indent1"><span class="nm">(a)</span><span class="cl">(Beraisa):</span> From the time of danger and onwards, the custom was to be married on Tuesday. Chachamim did not object;</p>
<p class="bas indent1"><span class="nm">(b)</span>One may not be married on Monday. If there is an Ones, it is allowed.</p>
<p class="bas indent1"><span class="nm">(c)</span>We separate the Chasan from the Kalah on Shabbos night (if they have not yet had Bi'ah), since the first Bi'ah causes a wound.</p>
<p class="bas indent1"><span class="nm">(d)</span><span class="cl">Question:</span> What danger does the Beraisa refer to?</p>
<p class="bas indent2"><span class="nm">1.</span>If there was a decree that any virgin married on Wednesday will be killed, why was it only a custom to be married on Tuesday? The enactment should be entirely uprooted!</p>
<p class="bas indent1"><span class="nm">(e)</span><span class="cl">Answer (Rava):</span> There was a decree that a virgin married on Wednesday must first have Bi'ah with the mayor.</p>
<p class="bas indent1"><span class="nm">(f)</span><span class="cl">Question:</span> This is Ones, it is not a danger!</p>
<p class="bas indent1"><span class="nm">(g)</span><span class="cl">Answer:</span> There are virtuous women who would resist, and be killed for doing so.</p>
<p class="bas indent1"><span class="nm">(h)</span><span class="cl">Question:</span> We should publicize that if a woman is forced into adultery, she is permitted to her husband!</p>
<p class="bas indent1"><span class="nm">(i)</span><span class="cl">Answer:</span> There are immoral women. (If we publicize the above law, they will willingly have Bi'ah. Their husbands will not know that their wives are forbidden.)</p>
<p class="bas indent1"><span class="nm">(j)</span>Also, there are wives of Kohanim, who become forbidden to their husbands even if they are forced (so publicizing the law will not help).</p>
<p class="bas indent1"><span class="nm">(k)</span><span class="cl">Question:</span> Why don't we uproot the enactment for virgins to get married on Wednesday?</p>
<p class="bas indent1"><span class="nm">(l)</span><span class="cl">Answer:</span> It is common that the (mayor's) decree is revoked. Therefore, Chachamim do not revoke their enactment due to the decree.</p>
<p class="bas indent1"><span class="nm">(m)</span><span class="cl">Question:</span> If the danger is like Rava says, the mayor will come on Tuesday to have Bi'ah Rishonah with the virgin!</p>
<p class="bas indent1"><span class="nm">(n)</span><span class="cl">Answer:</span> Since we do not formally enact Tuesday to be the day for the wedding, he is not sure that there is a wedding on Tuesday, so he will not bother to come.</p>
<p class="bas subject"><span class="nm">4)</span>WHAT HAPPENS WHEN THERE IS <i>ONES</i></p>
<p class="bas indent1"><span class="nm">(a)</span><span class="cl">Question:</span> What is the Ones of the Beraisa?</p>
<p class="bas indent2"><span class="nm">1.</span><span class="cl">Suggestion:</span> It is the mayor's decree.</p>
<p class="bas indent2"><span class="nm">2.</span><span class="cl">Rejection #1:</span> Above it was called danger. Why is it called Ones now?</p>
<p class="bas indent2"><span class="nm">3.</span><span class="cl">Rejection #2:</span> When there is that decree we said that the custom was to be married on Tuesday. Regarding Ones, we say that it is permitted!</p>
<p class="bas indent1"><span class="nm">(b)</span><span class="cl">Answer #1 (Rava):</span> People say that the general is coming to the city (and he will take the food prepared for the Chupah).</p>
<p class="bas indent1"><span class="nm">(c)</span><span class="cl">Question:</span> If he will leave promptly, we should delay the Chupah until after he leaves!</p>
<p class="bas indent1"><span class="nm">(d)</span><span class="cl">Answer:</span> He is going to fix himself in the city (for a while).</p>
<p class="bas indent1"><span class="nm">(e)</span><span class="cl">Question:</span> Why do we permit Monday? The Chupah should be on Tuesday!</p>
<p class="bas indent1"><span class="nm">(f)</span><span class="cl">Answer:</span> His scouts are coming on Tuesday (they will confiscate food for him).</p>
<p class="bas indent1"><span class="nm">(g)</span><span class="cl">Answer #2:</span> The Ones of the Beraisa is the death of the Chasan's father or the Kalah's mother.</p>
