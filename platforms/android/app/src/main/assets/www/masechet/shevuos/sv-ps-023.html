<p class="bas subject"><span class="nm">1)</span>DOES 'EATING' INCLUDE DRINKING? (cont.)</p>
<p class="bas indent1"><span class="nm">(a)</span>We can learn from a verse that 'eating' includes drinking:</p>
<p class="bas indent1"><span class="nm">(b)</span><span class="cl">Opinion #1 (Reish Lakish):</span> "V'Achalta (Ma'aser Sheni of)... Tiroshecha" - 'Tirosh' is wine, and it says 'you will eat'!</p>
<p class="bas indent1"><span class="nm">(c)</span><span class="cl">Rejection:</span> Perhaps he eats Anigron (a food made with wine).</p>
<p class="bas indent2"><span class="nm">1.</span><span class="cl">(Rabah bar Shmuel):</span> Anigron is a beet dish. Achsigron is made from other cooked vegetables.</p>
<p class="bas indent1"><span class="nm">(d)</span><span class="cl">Opinion #2 (Rav Acha bar Yakov):</span> "(You will buy with Ma'aser money)... uva'Yayin uva'Shechar... v'Achalta" discusses eating wine!</p>
<p class="bas indent1"><span class="nm">(e)</span><span class="cl">Question:</span> Perhaps here also, he eats Anigron!</p>
<p class="bas indent1"><span class="nm">(f)</span><span class="cl">Answer:</span> "Shechar" connotes something that is Meshaker (intoxicates).</p>
<p class="bas indent1"><span class="nm">(g)</span><span class="cl">Question:</span> Perhaps it refers to Ke'ilis figs (which intoxicate)!</p>
<p class="bas indent2"><span class="nm">1.</span>If one ate Ke'ilis figs, drank honey or milk and entered the Mikdash, he is liable.</p>
<p class="bas indent1"><span class="nm">(h)</span><span class="cl">Answer:</span> We learn a Gezerah Shavah "Shechar-Shechar" from a Nazir.</p>
<p class="bas indent2"><span class="nm">1.</span>Just like Shechar written about a Nazir refers to wine, also that written about Ma'aser.</p>
<p class="bas indent1"><span class="nm">(i)</span><span class="cl">(Rava):</span> Our Mishnah also teaches that 'eating' includes drinking.</p>
<p class="bas indent2"><span class="nm">1.</span><span class="cl">(Mishnah):</span> If one swore 'I will not eat' and he ate and drank, he is liable only once.</p>
<p class="bas indent2"><span class="nm">2.</span>If 'eating' includes drinking, we understand the need to teach this;</p>
<p class="bas indent2"><span class="nm">3.</span>However, if 'eating' does not includes drinking, this is (no Chidush at all,) like saying that he is liable only once for eating and doing Melachah!</p>
<p class="bas indent1"><span class="nm">(j)</span><span class="cl">Question (Abaye):</span> if you will say 'eating' includes drinking, the Seifa is difficult!</p>
<p class="bas indent2"><span class="nm">1.</span><span class="cl">(Seifa):</span> If he swore 'I will not eat and I will not drink' and he ate and drank, he is liable twice.</p>
<p class="bas indent2"><span class="nm">2.</span>Once he says 'I will not eat', he is already forbidden to drink;</p>
<p class="bas indent3"><span class="nm">i.</span>The oath not to drink should not take effect, just like one who swears twice 'I will not drink' (the second oath does not take effect)!</p>
<p class="bas indent1"><span class="nm">(k)</span><span class="cl">Answer #1 (Rava):</span> The case is, first he swore 'I will not drink' and then he swore 'I will not eat';</p>
<p class="bas indent2"><span class="nm">1.</span>'Eating' includes drinking, but 'drinking' does not include eating.</p>
<p class="bas indent1"><span class="nm">(l)</span><span class="cl">Objection:</span> Rava admits that if he swore 'I will not eat' and then 'I will not drink', he is liable only once;</p>
<p class="bas indent2"><span class="nm">1.</span>If so, the Reisha should teach thos! It is a bigger Chidush than when he swore only 'I will not eat'!</p>
<p class="bas indent1"><span class="nm">(m)</span><span class="cl">Answer #2:</span> Really, he swore first 'I will not eat';</p>
<p class="bas indent2"><span class="nm">1.</span>Since he then swore 'I will not drink', this shows that he did not include drinking in his first oath.</p>
<p class="bas indent1"><span class="nm">(n)</span><span class="cl">(Rav Ashi):</span> The end of our Mishnah also teaches that 'eating' includes drinking.</p>
<p class="bas indent2"><span class="nm">1.</span><span class="cl">(Mishnah):</span> If he swore 'I will not eat' and he ate things unfit to eat or drank liquids unfit to drink, he is exempt.</p>
<p class="bas indent2"><span class="nm">2.</span><span class="cl">Inference:</span> If he ate things proper to eat or drank liquids proper to drink he is liable, even though he swore only not to eat!</p>
<p class="bas indent1"><span class="nm">(o)</span><span class="cl">Rejection:</span> Perhaps the case is that he also swore not to drink.</p>
<p class="bas subject"><span class="nm">2)</span>COMBINING MANY OATHS IN ONE</p>
<p class="bas indent1"><span class="nm">(a)</span><span class="cl">(Mishnah):</span> If he swore... ('I will not eat wheat bread, barley bread and spelt bread', and he ate all three, he is liable for each).</p>
<p class="bas indent1"><span class="nm">(b)</span><span class="cl">Question:</span> Perhaps he did not intend to make three separate oaths. He only wanted to permit other kinds of bread!</p>
<p class="bas indent1"><span class="nm">(c)</span><span class="cl">Answer #1:</span> If so, he should have said 'wheat, barley and spelt.'</p>
<p class="bas indent2"><span class="nm">1.</span><span class="cl">Objection:</span> That would forbid (only) eating these grains raw!</p>
<p class="bas indent1"><span class="nm">(d)</span><span class="cl">Answer #2:</span> Rather, (if he only wanted to permit other kinds of bread) he should have said 'bread of wheat, barley and spelt.</p>
<p class="bas indent2"><span class="nm">1.</span><span class="cl">Objection:</span> That could mean, he will not eat wheat bread, or raw barley or spelt!</p>
<p class="bas indent1"><span class="nm">(e)</span><span class="cl">Answer #3:</span> Rather, he should have said 'bread of wheat and of barley and of spelt.'</p>
<p class="bas bbbline">23b----------------------------------------23b</p>
<p class="bas indent2"><span class="nm">1.</span><span class="cl">Objection:</span> Perhaps (he thought that) that would forbid only bread made of all three grains!</p>
<p class="bas indent1"><span class="nm">(f)</span><span class="cl">Answer #4:</span> Rather, he should have sworn 'I will not eat bread of wheat, and similarly of barley, and similarly of spelt.'</p>
<p class="bas indent2"><span class="nm">1.</span>There was no need to say 'bread' each time. Rather, he did so to make a separate oath for each.</p>
<p class="bas indent1"><span class="nm">(g)</span><span class="cl">(Mishnah):</span> If he swore... 'I will not drink (wine, oil or honey' and he drank all three, he is liable for each).</p>
<p class="bas indent1"><span class="nm">(h)</span><span class="cl">Question:</span> Granted, when he swore 'I will not eat wheat bread, barley bread... ', he is liable for each. Since he did not need to say 'bread' each time, it is extra to make each a separate oath;</p>
<p class="bas indent2"><span class="nm">1.</span>Regarding the drinks, why are they separate oaths? Perhaps he intended to permit other drinks!</p>
<p class="bas indent1"><span class="nm">(i)</span><span class="cl">Answer #1 (Rav Papa):</span> The case is, the drinks are in front of him;</p>
<p class="bas indent2"><span class="nm">1.</span>He should have sworn 'I will not drink these.' (Rather, he detailed each to make separate oaths).</p>
<p class="bas indent2"><span class="nm">2.</span><span class="cl">Objection:</span> Perhaps (he thought that) this does not forbid all wine, oil or honey.It forbids only what is in front of him!</p>
<p class="bas indent1"><span class="nm">(j)</span><span class="cl">Answer #2:</span> Rather, he should have sworn 'I will not drink (drinks) like these.'</p>
<p class="bas indent2"><span class="nm">1.</span><span class="cl">Objection:</span> (Perhaps he thought) this forbids only the quantity in front of him, but he may drink more or less!</p>
<p class="bas indent1"><span class="nm">(k)</span><span class="cl">Answer #3:</span> He should have sworn 'I will not drink these types (of drinks).'</p>
<p class="bas indent2"><span class="nm">1.</span><span class="cl">Objection:</span> (Perhaps he thought) this forbids <i>other</i> wine, oil and honey, but not what is in front of him!</p>
<p class="bas indent1"><span class="nm">(l)</span><span class="cl">Answer #4:</span> He should have sworn 'I will not drink these or their types.'</p>
<p class="bas indent1"><span class="nm">(m)</span><span class="cl">Answer #5 (Rav Acha brei d'Rav Ika):</span> The case is, Reuven was pressuring Shimon 'come drink wine, oil and honey with me.' It would have sufficed for Shimon to say 'I will not drink with you';</p>
<p class="bas indent2"><span class="nm">1.</span>'Wine, oil or honey', is extra, to make each a separate oath.</p>
<p class="bas indent1"><span class="nm">(n)</span><span class="cl">(Mishnah):</span> If Yehudah claimed that he deposited wheat, barley and spelt with Levi, and Levi swore (falsely) 'I don't have anything of yours', he is liable only once;</p>
<p class="bas indent2"><span class="nm">1.</span>If he swore 'I don't have wheat, barley or spelt of yours', he is liable for each one (that he has).</p>
<p class="bas indent2"><span class="nm">2.</span><span class="cl">(R. Yochanan):</span> If he has a Perutah's worth of wheat, barley and spelt altogether, they join up, and he is liable.</p>
<p class="bas indent2"><span class="nm">3.</span><span class="cl">(Rav Acha or Ravina):</span> (In the Seifa) he is liable only for the individual oaths (on each Min (species)). There is no collective (all-inclusive) oath (to be liable for a Perutah altogether. R. Yochanan, who says that they join up, refers to the Reisha, in which there is only a collective oath.)</p>
<p class="bas indent2"><span class="nm">4.</span><span class="cl">(The other of Rav Acha and Ravina):</span> He is liable for the individual oaths and for a collective oath. (R. Yochanan refers to the Reisha and Seifa.)</p>
<p class="bas indent1"><span class="nm">(o)</span><span class="cl">Question:</span> What is the law here (swearing not to eat or drink particular foods)?</p>
<p class="bas indent1"><span class="nm">(p)</span><span class="cl">Answer (Rava):</span> A Shomer (watchman) is liable for each false oath (since he could have admitted), he is liable for a collective oath and individual oaths;</p>
<p class="bas indent2"><span class="nm">1.</span>Here, we cannot say that there is a collective oath. If there were, he is already bound to keep it, so the individual oaths would not take effect!</p>
<p class="bas subject"><span class="nm">3)</span>AN OATH NOT TO EAT FORBIDDEN FOOD</p>
<p class="bas indent1"><span class="nm">(a)</span><span class="cl">(Mishnah):</span> If he swore 'I will not eat... '</p>
<p class="bas indent1"><span class="nm">(b)</span><span class="cl">Question:</span> In the Reisha, if he swore 'I will not eat' and he ate or drank things not proper to eat or drink, he is exempt;</p>
<p class="bas indent2"><span class="nm">1.</span>In the Seifa, if he ate Neveilos, Treifos, rodents or insects, he is liable. What is the difference?</p>
<p class="bas indent1"><span class="nm">(c)</span><span class="cl">Answer #1:</span> In the Reisha he swore Stam 'I will not eat.' In the Seifa, he specified ('I will not eat Neveilos... ')</p>
<p class="bas indent1"><span class="nm">(d)</span><span class="cl">Question:</span> Even if he specifies, why is he liable? He is already bound by the oath of Sinai not to eat them!</p>
<p class="bas indent1"><span class="nm">(e)</span><span class="cl">Answer #1 (Rav, Shmuel and R. Yochanan):</span> Because his oath takes effect on permitted food, it also takes effect on forbidden food.</p>
<p class="bas indent1"><span class="nm">(f)</span><span class="cl">Answer #2 (Reish Lakish):</span> The Torah forbids him only to eat a k'Zayis of these things. His oath forbids him from eating Mashehu;</p>
<p class="bas indent2"><span class="nm">1.</span>His Shevu'ah takes effect according to Chachamim if he specified (Mashehu), or according to R. Akiva even without specifying.</p>
<p class="bas indent1"><span class="nm">(g)</span>We understand why R. Yochanan did not answer like Reish Lakish. He prefers to establish the Mishnah like Chachamim <i>and</i> R. Akiva.</p>
<p class="bas indent1"><span class="nm">(h)</span><span class="cl">Question:</span> Why didn't Reish Lakish answer like R. Yochanan?</p>
<p class="bas indent1"><span class="nm">(i)</span><span class="cl">Answer:</span> The principle of Kolel (if an Isur forbids something that was permitted, it also takes effect on things already forbidden) applies only to prohibitions that the Torah imposed;</p>
<p class="bas indent2"><span class="nm">1.</span>It does not apply to Isurim that one imposes through oaths!</p>
