<p class="bas subject"><span class="nm">1)</span>IS PAYING A LOAN CONSIDERED GIVING BENEFIT?</p>
<p class="bas indent1"><span class="nm">(a)</span><span class="cl">(Gemara - Mishnah #1):</span> If a vow forbids Shimon to benefit from Reuven, Reuven may give the half-Shekel for Shimon, he may pay Shimon's debt, and he may return an object Shimon lost;</p>
<p class="bas indent2"><span class="nm">1.</span>In a place where one receives money for returning Aveidos, this amount is given to Hekdesh.</p>
<p class="bas indent1"><span class="nm">(b)</span><span class="cl">Question:</span> Granted, he may give his half-Shekel, for this is a Mitzvah;</p>
<p class="bas indent2"><span class="nm">1.</span><span class="cl">(Mishnah):</span> When half-Shekalim are taken (from the chamber) for buying Korbanos, they have in mind people whose half-Shekalim were lost, collected, or will be collected. (Rashi - in any case Shimon has a share in the Korbanos, so Reuven does not benefit him. Tosfos - Reuven may give 'compensation' on behalf of Shimon only when Shimon already gave and his Shekel was lost and Shimon need not give again.)</p>
<p class="bas indent2"><span class="nm">2.</span>We also understand why he returns Shimon's Aveidah. This is also a Mitzvah;</p>
<p class="bas indent2"><span class="nm">3.</span>Why may he pay Shimon's debt? This saves Shimon money!</p>
<p class="bas indent1"><span class="nm">(c)</span><span class="cl">Answer #1 (R. Oshaya):</span> Mishnah #1 is like Chanan, who says that one who feeds his friend's wife threw away his money. (Likewise, one need not repay one who paid his debt. Rashi - Reuven did not give anything to Shimon. Tosfos - he only <i>causes</i> benefit to him; the vow does not forbid this.)</p>
<p class="bas indent1"><span class="nm">(d)</span><span class="cl">Answer #2 (Rava):</span> Mishnah #1 is even like Chachamim. The case is, the loan was on condition that the lender cannot demand payment.</p>
<p class="bas indent1"><span class="nm">(e)</span><span class="cl">Question:</span> Granted, Rava did not answer like R. Oshaya, for Rava prefers to establish the Mishnah even like Chachamim;</p>
<p class="bas indent2"><span class="nm">1.</span>Why didn't R. Oshaya answer like Rava?</p>
<p class="bas indent1"><span class="nm">(f)</span><span class="cl">Version #1 - Answer:</span> Granted, repaying such a loan is not like giving him money, but he spares him shame. (We follow the Bach's text.)</p>
<p class="bas bbbline">108b----------------------------------------108b</p>
<p class="bas indent1"><span class="nm">(g)</span><span class="cl">Version #2 - Answer:</span> In Rava's case, he benefits him. He spares him shame. (Rav Ransberg - according to this version, sparing him shame is considered proper benefit.)</p>
<p class="bas subject"><span class="nm">2)</span>WHEN GIRLS ARE FED BEFORE BOYS</p>
<p class="bas indent1"><span class="nm">(a)</span><span class="cl">(Mishnah):</span> Admon said seven laws (they are in the coming Mishnayos). The first is the following:</p>
<p class="bas indent2"><span class="nm">1.</span>If a man died leaving sons and daughters, if the estate is big (enough to feed all the children for 12 months), the sons inherit and the daughters are fed. If the estate is small, (Chachamim say that) the daughters are fed and the sons beg for their food;</p>
<p class="bas indent2"><span class="nm">2.</span><span class="cl">Admon:</span> Why should a male lose?!</p>
<p class="bas indent2"><span class="nm">3.</span><span class="cl">R. Gamliel:</span> I agree with Admon.</p>
<p class="bas indent1"><span class="nm">(b)</span><span class="cl">(Gemara) Question:</span> What is Admon's astonishment?</p>
<p class="bas indent1"><span class="nm">(c)</span><span class="cl">Answer #1 (Abaye):</span> Why should a male lose? He is fitting to learn Torah!</p>
<p class="bas indent1"><span class="nm">(d)</span><span class="cl">Objection (Rava):</span> Does only one who engages in Torah inherit?!</p>
<p class="bas indent1"><span class="nm">(e)</span><span class="cl">Answer #2 (Rava):</span> Rather, a male inherits when there is much property. Why should he lose when there is little property?!</p>
<p class="bas subject"><span class="nm">3)</span>A PARTIAL ADMISSION</p>
<p class="bas indent1"><span class="nm">(a)</span><span class="cl">(Mishnah - Admon):</span> If Reuven claims that Shimon owes him barrels of oil and Shimon admits that he owes barrels, since he admits to part of the claim, he must swear;</p>
<p class="bas indent1"><span class="nm">(b)</span>Chachamim say, the admission is not from the same class as the claim (so he need not swear).</p>
<p class="bas indent1"><span class="nm">(c)</span><span class="cl">R. Gamliel:</span> I agree with Admon.</p>
<p class="bas indent1"><span class="nm">(d)</span><span class="cl">(Gemara):</span> From Chachamim we learn that if Reuven claims wheat and barley and Shimon agrees that he owes barley, he need not swear that he does not owe wheat.</p>
<p class="bas indent1"><span class="nm">(e)</span><span class="cl">Question:</span> This refutes Rav Nachman!</p>
<p class="bas indent2"><span class="nm">1.</span><span class="cl">(Rav Nachman):</span> If Reuven claims wheat and barley and Shimon admits to one of them, he must swear.</p>
<p class="bas indent1"><span class="nm">(f)</span><span class="cl">Answer #1 (Rav Yehudah):</span> In our Mishnah he claimed a measure of oil, not barrels.</p>
<p class="bas indent1"><span class="nm">(g)</span><span class="cl">Rejection:</span> If so, why do Chachamim obligate him to swear?</p>
<p class="bas indent1"><span class="nm">(h)</span><span class="cl">Answer #2 (Rava):</span> All agree that if Reuven said 'I own the volume of 10 barrels of oil in your pit', he only claims oil, not barrels;</p>
<p class="bas indent2"><span class="nm">1.</span>If he said 'I have 10 barrels full of oil by you', all agree that he claims oil and barrels;</p>
<p class="bas indent2"><span class="nm">2.</span>They argue about when he said 'I have 10 barrels of oil by you'.</p>
<p class="bas indent2"><span class="nm">3.</span>Admon says, these words include the barrels. Chachamim say that they do not.</p>
<p class="bas indent1"><span class="nm">(i)</span><span class="cl">Inference:</span> If Chachamim would agree that these words include the barrels, they would agree that he must swear.</p>
<p class="bas indent1"><span class="nm">(j)</span><span class="cl">Question:</span> This refutes R. Chiya bar Aba!</p>
<p class="bas indent2"><span class="nm">1.</span><span class="cl">(R. Chiya bar Aba):</span> If Reuven claims wheat and barley, and Shimon admits to one of them, he need not swear.</p>
<p class="bas indent1"><span class="nm">(k)</span><span class="cl">Answer #1 (Rav Simi bar Ashi):</span> Claiming barrels and oil is like claiming a pomegranate and its peel (i.e. they are like one class).</p>
<p class="bas indent1"><span class="nm">(l)</span><span class="cl">Rejection (Ravina):</span> A pomegranate cannot last at all without its peel, but oil can last without barrels!</p>
<p class="bas indent1"><span class="nm">(m)</span><span class="cl">Answer #2 (Ravina):</span> The case is, he said 'I have 10 barrels of oil by you.' Shimon denied having any of his oil, but admitted to having five barrels;</p>
<p class="bas indent2"><span class="nm">1.</span>Admon says, these words (10 barrels of oil) include the barrels. Since Shimon must swear about the barrels, he must also swear about the oil through Gilgul (once one must swear about one matter, his opponent can force him to include other matters in the oath);</p>
<p class="bas indent2"><span class="nm">2.</span>Chachamim say that these words do not include the barrels. Shimon totally denied the claim, so he need not swear.</p>
