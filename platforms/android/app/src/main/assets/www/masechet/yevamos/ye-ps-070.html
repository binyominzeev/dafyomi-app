<p class="bas subject"><span class="nm">1)</span>AN <i>ARUSAH</i> THAT BECAME PREGNANT (cont.)</p>
<p class="bas indent1"><span class="nm">(a)</span><span class="cl">(Rava):</span> Presumably, Rav's law is when she is not suspected of Bi'ah with her betrothed, and is suspected of Bi'ah with others.</p>
<p class="bas indent2"><span class="nm">1.</span>If she was suspected of Bi'ah with him, even if she was also suspected of Bi'ah with others, we would attribute the child to her husband.</p>
<p class="bas indent1"><span class="nm">(b)</span><span class="cl">Support (Rava, for himself - Mishnah):</span> If a woman (raped or enticed by a Kohen) gave birth, she may eat.</p>
<p class="bas indent2"><span class="nm">1.</span><span class="cl">Question:</span> What is the case?</p>
<p class="bas indent3"><span class="nm">i.</span>If she is suspected of Bi'ah with him but not with others, surely she eats. The Mishnah would not need to teach this!</p>
<p class="bas indent2"><span class="nm">2.</span><span class="cl">Answer (Rava):</span> Rather, we must say that she is also suspected of Bi'ah with others.</p>
<p class="bas indent2"><span class="nm">3.</span>Even though she is forbidden both to him and to all others, we assume that the child is from him.</p>
<p class="bas indent2"><span class="nm">4.</span>Here, an Arusah is permitted to her husband and forbidden to all others. All the more so, we should assume that the child is from her husband!</p>
<p class="bas indent1"><span class="nm">(c)</span><span class="cl">Objection (Abaye):</span> Perhaps Rav disqualifies the child whenever she is suspected of others, even if she is also suspected of her betrothed;</p>
<p class="bas indent2"><span class="nm">1.</span>In our Mishnah, she was not suspected of Bi'ah at all (except for the time she was raped or enticed).</p>
<p class="bas indent1"><span class="nm">(d)</span><span class="cl">(Mishnah):</span> A slave disqualifies through Bi'ah (but not due to seed).</p>
<p class="bas indent1"><span class="nm">(e)</span><span class="cl">Question:</span> What is the source of this (that children of a Shifchah are not attributed to their father)?</p>
<p class="bas indent1"><span class="nm">(f)</span><span class="cl">Answer:</span> "The woman (the Shifchah designated for an Eved Ivri) and her children will be (slaves to her master)".</p>
<p class="bas indent1"><span class="nm">(g)</span><span class="cl">(Mishnah):</span> A Mamzer can disqualify or permit eating.</p>
<p class="bas indent1"><span class="nm">(h)</span><span class="cl">(Beraisa) Question:</span> "V'Zera Ein Lah" teaches only that children forbid. What is the source that grandchildren forbid?</p>
<p class="bas indent2"><span class="nm">1.</span><span class="cl">Answer:</span> "V'Zera Ein Lah" - any seed. <span class="note">(<span class="notewd">Note:</span> The continuation of the Gemara suggests that perhaps the text should be like in Kidushin 4a, we  read "Ein Lah" like 'Ayen Lah', investigate her. Even if she has no living children, grandchildren forbid her.)</span></p>
<p class="bas indent2"><span class="nm">2.</span><span class="cl">Question:</span> This teaches that Kosher children forbid. What is the source that Pasul children (Mamzerim) forbid?</p>
<p class="bas indent2"><span class="nm">3.</span><span class="cl">Answer:</span> "Ein Lah" - 'Ayen Lah'.</p>
<p class="bas indent2"><span class="nm">4.</span><span class="cl">Question:</span> We expounded this to teach that grandchildren forbid her!</p>
<p class="bas indent2"><span class="nm">5.</span><span class="cl">Answer:</span> Really, the verse is not needed for grandchildren, for we know that they are like children. The verse is needed only for Mamzerim.</p>
<p class="bas indent1"><span class="nm">(i)</span><span class="cl">Question (Reish Lakish):</span> (The Mishnah says, if a Nochri or slave had Bi'ah with the daughter, her child is a Mamzer.) Is this like R. Akiva, who says that Mamzerim come from Chayavei Lavin?</p>
<p class="bas indent1"><span class="nm">(j)</span><span class="cl">Answer (R. Yochanan):</span> It is even like Chachamim. They agree about a child from a Nochri or slave:</p>
<p class="bas indent2"><span class="nm">1.</span><span class="cl">(Rav Dimi, citing Rebbi):</span> The child of a Nochri or slave from a Bas Yisrael is a Mamzer.</p>
<p class="bas indent1"><span class="nm">(k)</span><span class="cl">(Mishnah):</span> Sometimes a Kohen Gadol can forbid eating.</p>
<p class="bas indent1"><span class="nm">(l)</span>His grandmother says, 'I should atone for my grandson the Mamzer, who permits me to eat Terumah, but not for my grandson the Kohen Gadol, who forbids me.' (One woman does not say both of these. The Tana merely teaches that both of these are possible.)</p>
<p class="perekline">PEREK HA'AREL</p>
<p class="bas subject"><span class="nm">2)</span>WHO MAY EAT <i>TERUMAH</i></p>
<p class="bas indent1"><span class="nm">(a)</span><span class="cl">(Mishnah):</span> An Arel (uncircumcised man) or Tamei may not eat Terumah. His wife and slaves may eat.</p>
<p class="bas indent1"><span class="nm">(b)</span>A Petzu'a Daka or Krus Shafchah may eat and his slaves may eat, but his wife may not. If he did not have Bi'ah with her since becoming a Petzu'a Dacha or Krus Shafchah, she may eat.</p>
<p class="bas indent2"><span class="nm">1.</span>A Petzu'a Daka is one whose Beitzim were crushed, even one of them;</p>
<p class="bas indent2"><span class="nm">2.</span>A Krus Shafchah is one whose Ever was cut. If even a hair's width remains from the crown, he is permitted.</p>
<p class="bas indent1"><span class="nm">(c)</span><span class="cl">(Gemara - Beraisa - R. Eliezer) Question:</span> What is the source that an Arel may not eat Terumah?</p>
<p class="bas indent1"><span class="nm">(d)</span><span class="cl">Answer #1 (R. Eliezer):</span> It says "Toshav v'Sachir (a resident or hired worker)" regarding Korban Pesach, and also regarding Terumah;</p>
<p class="bas indent2"><span class="nm">1.</span>Just like an Arel may not eat Korban Pesach, he may not eat Terumah.</p>
<p class="bas indent1"><span class="nm">(e)</span><span class="cl">Answer #2 (R. Akiva):</span> We need not learn from there. It says "Ish Ish" (regarding the Isur for a Tamei to eat Terumah) to include an Arel.</p>
<p class="bas indent1"><span class="nm">(f)</span><span class="cl">Suggestion:</span> The words ("Toshav v'Sachir") must be extra, for otherwise we can challenge R. Eliezer's Gezeirah Shavah:</p>
<p class="bas indent2"><span class="nm">1.</span>Korban Pesach is more stringent. One is Chayav [Kares] for eating it if it is Pigul (was offered with intent to eat it past the allowed time) or Nosar (left past the allowed time), or if one eats it when he is Tamei. We cannot learn to Terumah, which lacks these stringencies!</p>
<p class="bas indent2"><span class="nm">2.</span><span class="cl">Conclusion:</span> Correct! The words are extra.</p>
<p class="bas indent1"><span class="nm">(g)</span><span class="cl">Question:</span> Where are the words extra, regarding Pesach or regarding Terumah?</p>
<p class="bas indent2"><span class="nm">1.</span><span class="cl">Suggestion:</span> The words regarding Terumah are extra.</p>
<p class="bas indent2"><span class="nm">2.</span><span class="cl">Rejection (Beraisa):</span> ("Toshav v'Sachir", Avadim Ivriyim of a Kohen, may not eat Terumah.) "Toshav" is an Eved Ivri acquired until Yovel. "V'Sachir" is an Eved Ivri acquired for (six) years.</p>
<p class="bas indent2"><span class="nm">3.</span><span class="cl">Question:</span> It should suffice for the Torah to say that a Toshav does not eat!</p>
<p class="bas indent3"><span class="nm">i.</span>If one acquired until Yovel does not eat, all the more so one acquired for years does not!</p>
<p class="bas indent2"><span class="nm">4.</span><span class="cl">Answer:</span> Had it said only "Toshav", we would have thought that this refers to one acquired for years, but one acquired until Yovel eats!</p>
<p class="bas indent3"><span class="nm">i.</span>Therefore it also says "v'Sachir" to teach that even one acquired until Yovel does not eat.</p>
<p class="bas indent1"><span class="nm">(h)</span><span class="cl">Answer:</span> The words are extra regarding Pesach:</p>
<p class="bas indent2"><span class="nm">1.</span><span class="cl">Question:</span> "<i>Toshav v'Sachir</i> (may not eat Korban Pesach)" - to whom does this refer?</p>
<p class="bas indent2"><span class="nm">2.</span><span class="cl">Answer #1:</span> It refers to Avadim Ivriyim acquired for years or until Yovel.</p>
<p class="bas indent2"><span class="nm">3.</span><span class="cl">Rejection:</span> He is not exempt from Pesach!</p>
<p class="bas indent3"><span class="nm">i.</span>He may not eat Terumah (even if his master is a Kohen). This shows that his master does not own his body;</p>
<p class="bas bbbline">70b----------------------------------------70b</p>
<p class="bas indent3"><span class="nm">ii.</span>Regarding Pesach he should be obligated, since his master does not own him (he is a proper Yisrael).</p>
<p class="bas indent2"><span class="nm">4.</span><span class="cl">Conclusion:</span> The words are extra. (Tosfos - we can say that they refer to Nochri workers, but this is no Chidush at all, for it already forbids Arel and Ben Nechar.)</p>
<p class="bas indent1"><span class="nm">(i)</span><span class="cl">Question:</span> The Gezeirah Shavah is free only from one side. R. Eliezer holds that we learn from such a Gezeirah Shavah only if it cannot be challenged (and this one can be challenged, like above (f:1))!</p>
<p class="bas indent1"><span class="nm">(j)</span><span class="cl">Answer:</span> Since neither word ("Toshav" or "v'Sachir") is needed, we can apply one of them to what we wish to learn (Terumah), and one to the source (Pesach), and now the Gezeirah Shavah is free from both sides.</p>
<p class="bas subject"><span class="nm">3)</span>WHY DO WE LEARN ONLY <i>AREL</i> FROM <i>PESACH</i>?</p>
<p class="bas indent1"><span class="nm">(a)</span><span class="cl">Question:</span> An Onen should be forbidden to eat Terumah, just like he may not eat Pesach!</p>
<p class="bas indent1"><span class="nm">(b)</span><span class="cl">Answer (R. Yosi bar Chanina):</span> "Any Zar (will not eat Terumah)" - a Zar is forbidden, but an Onen is not.</p>
<p class="bas indent1"><span class="nm">(c)</span><span class="cl">Question:</span> We should say that a Zar is forbidden, but not an Arel!</p>
<p class="bas indent1"><span class="nm">(d)</span><span class="cl">Answer:</span> The Gezeirah Shavah forbids an Arel.</p>
<p class="bas indent1"><span class="nm">(e)</span><span class="cl">Question:</span> Why does he say that the Gezeirah Shavah forbids an Arel, and "V'Chol Zar" permits an Onen (and not vice-versa)?</p>
<p class="bas indent1"><span class="nm">(f)</span><span class="cl">Answer:</span> It is more reasonable to forbid an Arel, since he has the following stringencies:</p>
<p class="bas indent2"><span class="nm">1.</span>He needs to do an action (circumcision);</p>
<p class="bas indent2"><span class="nm">2.</span>This action must be done to his body;</p>
<p class="bas indent2"><span class="nm">3.</span>The punishment for remaining Arel is Kares;</p>
<p class="bas indent2"><span class="nm">4.</span>The Isur applied before Matan Torah;</p>
<p class="bas indent2"><span class="nm">5.</span>Failure to circumcise one's sons and (male) slaves prevents him (from eating Pesach).</p>
<p class="bas indent1"><span class="nm">(g)</span><span class="cl">Question:</span> We should forbid an Onen due to his stringencies!</p>
<p class="bas indent2"><span class="nm">1.</span>Aninus can apply at any time (whereas Orlah never returns after Milah);</p>
<p class="bas indent2"><span class="nm">2.</span>It applies to men and women;</p>
<p class="bas indent2"><span class="nm">3.</span>An Onen cannot fix himself (end his Aninus when he wants).</p>
<p class="bas indent1"><span class="nm">(h)</span><span class="cl">Answer #1:</span> There are more stringencies of an Arel.</p>
<p class="bas indent1"><span class="nm">(i)</span><span class="cl">Answer #2 (Rava):</span> Even if there would not be more, we would rather learn Arel from Pesach to Terumah, since Arel is written regarding Pesach. Onen is not written regarding Pesach; we learn from Ma'aser.</p>
<p class="bas indent1"><span class="nm">(j)</span><span class="cl">Suggestion:</span> Just like failure to circumcise one's sons or slaves forbids the father or master to eat Pesach, it should forbid him to eat Terumah!</p>
<p class="bas indent1"><span class="nm">(k)</span><span class="cl">Rejection:</span> "You will circumcise him, then he will eat <i>it</i>" - failure to circumcise sons and slaves forbids eating Pesach, but not eating Terumah.</p>
<p class="bas indent1"><span class="nm">(l)</span><span class="cl">Question:</span> If so, we should also expound "Any Arel will not eat <i>it</i>" - an Arel may not eat Pesach, but he may eat Terumah!</p>
<p class="bas indent1"><span class="nm">(m)</span><span class="cl">Answer:</span> The Gezeirah Shavah "Toshav v'Sachir" forbids an Arel to eat Terumah.</p>
<p class="bas indent1"><span class="nm">(n)</span><span class="cl">Question:</span> Perhaps we should learn oppositely (the Gezeirah Shavah forbids one to eat Terumah until he circumcises his sons and slaves, and "it" permits an Arel to eat Terumah)!</p>
<p class="bas indent1"><span class="nm">(o)</span><span class="cl">Answer:</span> It is more reasonable to forbid an Arel himself, because:</p>
<p class="bas indent2"><span class="nm">1.</span>The action must be done to his own body;</p>
<p class="bas indent2"><span class="nm">2.</span>The punishment for remaining Arel is Kares.</p>
<p class="bas indent1"><span class="nm">(p)</span><span class="cl">Question:</span> We should forbid one who did not circumcise his sons and slaves, because it can apply at any time!</p>
<p class="bas indent1"><span class="nm">(q)</span><span class="cl">Answer #1:</span> There are more stringencies of an Arel himself.</p>
<p class="bas indent1"><span class="nm">(r)</span><span class="cl">Answer #2:</span> Even if there would not be more, we never find that one's own Arelus does not forbid him (to do something), but someone else's Arelus does!</p>
