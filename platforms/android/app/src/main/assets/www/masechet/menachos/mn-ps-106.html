<div class="indent1"><span class="nm">(a)</span><p><span class="cl">Question:</span> We do not know what to do with the extra oil!</p></div>
<div class="indent2"><span class="nm">1.</span><p>If he vowed half Chalos and half Rekikim, some of the half-Log of oil for the Rekikim is put on them. The extra is added to the half-Log for the Chalos and mixed with the flour for the Chalos;</p></div>
<div class="indent2"><span class="nm">2.</span><p>If he vowed only Rekikim, Kohanim eat all the excess oil!</p></div>
<div class="indent1"><span class="nm">(b)</span><p><span class="cl">Answer:</span> The Beraisa is like R. Shimon ben Yehudah:</p></div>
<div class="indent2"><span class="nm">1.</span><p><span class="cl">(Beraisa - R. Shimon ben Yehudah citing R. Shimon):</span> If he vowed some Chalos and some Rekikim, he anoints the Rekikim in the form of a Chai. Kohanim eat the extra oil.</p></div>
<div class="indent1"><span class="nm">(c)</span><p><span class="cl">Question (Rav Kahana):</span> Perhaps he vowed Minchas Nesachim!</p></div>
<div class="indent2"><span class="nm">1.</span><p><span class="cl">(Rava):</span> One may bring a Nedavah of Minchas Nesachim (by itself) every day.</p></div>
<div class="indent1"><span class="nm">(d)</span><p><span class="cl">Answer #1:</span> We suspect only that he vowed to bring something that only individuals bring, but not something brought by the Tzibur;</p></div>
<div class="indent1"><span class="nm">(e)</span><p><span class="cl">Answer #2:</span> We suspect only that he vowed to bring something that (normally) is brought by itself.</p></div>
<div class="indent1"><span class="nm">(f)</span><p><span class="cl">Answer #3:</span> We suspect only that he vowed to bring something that requires Levonah.</p></div>
<div class="indent1"><span class="nm">(g)</span><p><span class="cl">Answer #4:</span> We suspect only that he vowed to bring something that requires one Log of oil (per Isaron), and not three (or two) Lugim.</p></div>
<div class="indent1"><span class="nm">(h)</span><p><span class="cl">Answer #5:</span> We suspect only that he vowed to bring something that requires Kemitzah.</p></div>
<div class="subject"><span class="nm">2)</span><p>THE ARGUMENT OF REBBI AND CHACHAMIM</p></div>
<div class="indent1"><span class="nm">(a)</span><p><span class="cl">(Mishnah):</span> If he knows that he specified a certain number of Esronim...</p></div>
<div class="indent1"><span class="nm">(b)</span><p><span class="cl">(Beraisa - Chachamim):</span> If he knows that he specified to bring a certain number of Esronim in one Kli, but does not remember the amount, he must bring 60 Esronim;</p></div>
<div class="indent1"><span class="nm">(c)</span><p>Rebbi says, he must bring Menachos of every size, from one Isaron until 60, 1830 Esronim in all.</p></div>
<div class="indent1"><span class="nm">(d)</span><p>Chachamim say, if he knows that he specified the type and size of Minchah, but does not remember either, he must bring a Minchah of 60 Esronim of each of the five types;</p></div>
<div class="indent1"><span class="nm">(e)</span><p>Rebbi says, he must bring Menachos of every size, from one Isaron until 60, for each of the five types, 9150 Esronim in all.</p></div>
<div class="indent1"><span class="nm">(f)</span><p><span class="cl">Question:</span> What do they argue about?</p></div>
<div class="indent1"><span class="nm">(g)</span><p><span class="cl">Answer #1 (Rav Chisda):</span> They argue about whether one may bring Chulin into the Azarah:</p></div>
<div class="indent2"><span class="nm">1.</span><p>Chachamim permit. Therefore, he brings 60 Esronim. Some (or all) is his vow, and the rest is Chulin;</p></div>
<div class="indent2"><span class="nm">2.</span><p>Rebbi forbids Chulin in the Azarah. Therefore, the only solution is to bring Menachos of every size. (One is his vow, and the rest are Nedavos.)</p></div>
<div class="indent1"><span class="nm">(h)</span><p><span class="cl">Answer #2 (Rabah):</span> All forbid Chulin in the Azarah. They argue about whether or not one may mix Chovah (the vow he was obligated to bring) with Nedavah:</p></div>
<div class="indent2"><span class="nm">1.</span><p>Chachamim permit. He brings 60 Esronim. Some (or all) is his vow, and the rest is Nedavah;</p></div>
<div class="indent2"><span class="nm">2.</span><p>Rebbi forbids mixing. Therefore, he must bring Menachos of every size.</p></div>
<div class="indent1"><span class="nm">(i)</span><p><span class="cl">Question (Abaye):</span> You say that Chachamim permit mixing Chovah with Nedavah. Kemitzah of each must be taken!</p></div>
<div class="indent1"><span class="nm">(j)</span><p><span class="cl">Answer:</span> A Kemitzah is taken for one of them, and another for the other.</p></div>
<div class="indent1"><span class="nm">(k)</span><p><span class="cl">Question:</span> Perhaps some of the Kemitzah l'Shem Chovah was from the Nedavah, and/or vice-versa!</p></div>
<div class="indent1"><span class="nm">(l)</span><p><span class="cl">Answer:</span> The owner stipulates based on what the Kohen will take:</p></div>
<div class="indent2"><span class="nm">1.</span><p>Whatever the Kohen takes in his hand the first time is (part of the) Chovah. What he takes the second time is Nedavah.</p></div>
<div class="indent1"><span class="nm">(m)</span><p><span class="cl">Question:</span> How can he be Maktir the Kamatzim?</p></div>
<div class="indent2"><span class="nm">1.</span><p>If he is Maktir (the Kometz of) the Nedavah first, he cannot Maktir (that of) the Chovah later. Perhaps all of it was Chovah, and the Shirayim are Chaserim (a 'Kometz' was Huktar l'Shem Nedavah);</p></div>
<div class="indent3"><span class="nm">i.</span><p>If Shirei Minchah became Chaser in between Kemitzah and Haktarah, we are not Maktir the Kometz.</p></div>
<div class="indent2"><span class="nm">2.</span><p>If he is Maktir the Chovah first he cannot be Maktir the Nedavah later. Perhaps all of it was Chovah, and the 'Kometz' of the Nedavah is really Shirayim;</p></div>
<div class="bbbline">106b----------------------------------------106b</p></div>
<div class="indent3"><span class="nm">i.</span><p>One may not be Maktir Shirayim of anything which is partially Huktar!</p></div>
<div class="indent1"><span class="nm">(n)</span><p><span class="cl">Answer (Rav Yehudah brei d'R. Shimon ben Pazi):</span> (He is Maktir the Chovah first.) When he is Maktir the Nedavah, he stipulates that if all of it was Chovah, it is (not l'Shem Kometz, rather,) l'Shem Etzim (like burning wood on the Mizbe'ach, i.e. not an obligatory Avodah). This is like R. Eliezer;</p></div>
<div class="indent2"><span class="nm">1.</span><p><span class="cl">(Beraisa - R. Eliezer):</span> (You may not offer Chametz or honey (i.e. any sweet derivative of fruit) on the Mizbe'ach) "l'Re'ach Nicho'ach" (to fulfill Hash-m's will), but they may be burned l'Shem Etzim.</p></div>
<div class="indent1"><span class="nm">(o)</span><p><span class="cl">Question (Rav Acha brei d'Rava):</span> Perhaps all permit mixing Chovah with Nedavah, and they argue about R. Eliezer's law. Chachamim agree with it, and Rebbi does not!</p></div>
<div class="indent1"><span class="nm">(p)</span><p><span class="cl">Answer (Rav Ashi):</span> If Rebbi permitted mixing Chovah with Nedavah, just he disagreed with R. Eliezer's law, it would suffice to offer two Menachos;</p></div>
<div class="indent2"><span class="nm">1.</span><p>He would put one Isaron in one Kli (Nedavah) and 60 in the other Kli (for the vow, and the excess over the vow is Nedavah), touch them together, and take Kemitzah from each.</p></div>
<div class="indent1"><span class="nm">(q)</span><p><span class="cl">Answer #3 (to question (f) - Rava):</span> All permit mixing Chovah with Nedavah. All agree to R. Eliezer's law. They argue like R. Eliezer ben Yakov and Chachamim;</p></div>
<div class="indent2"><span class="nm">1.</span><p><span class="cl">(Mishnah):</span> One Log of oil is used for each Log of Minchas Nedavah. There are 60 Lugim for 60 Esronim;</p></div>
<div class="indent2"><span class="nm">2.</span><p>R. Eliezer ben Yakov says, only one Log is used, even for 60 Esronim - "l'Minchah v'Log Shamen."</p></div>
<div class="indent2"><span class="nm">3.</span><p>Chachamim (who argue with Rebbi) hold like Chachamim of this Mishnah. In any case, 60 Lugim are used for 60 Esronim, whether it is all Chovah or partially Nedavah;</p></div>
<div class="indent2"><span class="nm">4.</span><p>Rebbi holds like R. Eliezer. We cannot bring one Minchah of 60 Esronim, for we do not know whether it is all Chovah (and requires only one Lug) or is partially Nedavah (and requires two Lugim).</p></div>
<div class="indent1"><span class="nm">(r)</span><p><span class="cl">Answer #4 (Rav Ashi):</span> They argue about whether one who brought a larger Minchah than he vowed was Yotzei. Chachamim hold that he was, and Rebbi holds that he was not.</p></div>
<div class="indent1"><span class="nm">(s)</span><p><span class="cl">Question:</span> They already argued about this elsewhere!</p></div>
<div class="indent2"><span class="nm">1.</span><p><span class="cl">(Mishnah):</span> If one vowed to bring a small Zevach and brought a big Zevach, he was Yotzei;</p></div>
<div class="indent2"><span class="nm">2.</span><p>Rebbi says, he was not Yotzei.</p></div>
<div class="indent1"><span class="nm">(t)</span><p><span class="cl">Answer:</span> The argument must be taught in both cases:</p></div>
<div class="indent2"><span class="nm">1.</span><p>Had they argued only about  Menachos, one might have thought that Chachamim say that he was Yotzei because in any case one Kometz is offered, but regarding Zevachim, a bigger animal has more Eimurim, so all agree that he was not Yotzei (it is unlike his vow);</p></div>
<div class="indent2"><span class="nm">2.</span><p>Had they argued only about Zevachim, one might have thought that Rebbi argues there because a bigger animal has more Eimurim, but he agrees about Menachos, for in any case one Kometz is offered.</p></div>
<div class="subject"><span class="nm">3)</span><p>MINIMAL NEDAVOS</p></div>
<div class="indent1"><span class="nm">(a)</span><p><span class="cl">(Mishnah):</span> If one said 'Alai Etzim', he must bring at least two big logs;</p></div>
<div class="indent1"><span class="nm">(b)</span><p>If he vowed to bring Levonah, he must bring at least a Kometz.</p></div>
<div class="indent1"><span class="nm">(c)</span><p>The Shi'ur of a Kometz applies to five things:</p></div>
<div class="indent2"><span class="nm">1.</span><p>One who vows to bring Levonah must bring at least a Kometz;</p></div>
<div class="indent2"><span class="nm">2.</span><p>One who brings Minchas Nedavah must bring a Kometz of Levonah;</p></div>
<div class="indent2"><span class="nm">3.</span><p>One who offers a Kometz outside the Mikdash is liable;</p></div>
<div class="indent2"><span class="nm">4.</span><p>Each of the two Bazichim (spoons of Levonah brought with Lechem ha'Panim) must have a Kometz. (This counts like two of the five things.)</p></div>
<div class="indent1"><span class="nm">(d)</span><p>If one said 'Alai Zahav', he must bring at least a gold Dinar;</p></div>
<div class="indent1"><span class="nm">(e)</span><p>If one said 'Alai Kesef', he must bring at least a silver Dinar;</p></div>
<div class="indent1"><span class="nm">(f)</span><p>If one said 'Alai Nechoshes', he must bring copper worth a silver Ma'ah (a sixth of a Dinar).</p></div>
<div class="indent1"><span class="nm">(g)</span><p>If he says 'I specified how much I will bring, but I do not remember how much', he must bring an amount that he is sure that he did not vow more than this.</p></div>
<div class="indent1"><span class="nm">(h)</span><p><span class="cl">(Gemara - Beraisa):</span> "Korban" teaches that one may bring a Nedavah of wood.</p></div>
<div class="indent2"><span class="nm">1.</span><p>One must bring at least two large logs - "veha'Goralos Hipalnu Al Korban ha'Etzim." (Tosfos - if he did not vow to bring 'Etzim', rather, to bring 'Etz', one log suffices.)</p></div>
<div class="indent2"><span class="nm">2.</span><p>Rebbi says, wood is considered a Korban. It requires salt and Hagashah (for it is equated to a Minchah.)</p></div>
<div class="indent2"><span class="nm">3.</span><p><span class="cl">(Rava):</span> According to Rebbi, wood requires Kemitzah.</p></div>
<div class="indent2"><span class="nm">4.</span><p><span class="cl">(Rav Papa):</span> According to Rebbi, wood requires (must be burned on) other wood.</p></div>
<div class="indent1"><span class="nm">(i)</span><p><span class="cl">(Mishnah):</span> If he vowed to bring Levonah, he must bring at least a Kometz.</p></div>

<div class="indent1"><span class="nm">(k)</span><p><span class="cl">Answer:</span> "V'Herim Mimenu b'Kumtzo mi'Soles ha'Minchah umi'Shmanah v'Es Kol ha'Levonah" equates Levonah to the part taken from the Minchah, i.e. a Kometz.</p></div>
<div class="indent1"><span class="nm">(l)</span><p><span class="cl">(Beraisa):</span> If one said 'Alai l'Mizbe'ach', he must bring Levonah, for this is the only thing that is entirely for the Mizbe'ach;</p></div>
<div class="indent2"><span class="nm">1.</span><p>If he says 'I specified what I will bring, but I do not remember what', he must bring everything offered on the Mizbe'ach.</p></div>
