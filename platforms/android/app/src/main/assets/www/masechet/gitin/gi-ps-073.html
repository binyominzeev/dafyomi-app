<p class="bas subject"><span class="nm">1)</span>ACTIONS OF A <i>SHECHIV</i> <i>MERA</i></p>
<p class="bas indent1"><span class="nm">(a)</span><span class="cl">Suggestion:</span> This implies that if a Shechiv Mera who went from one illness to another (and died) gave a gift, it is valid!</p>
<p class="bas indent1"><span class="nm">(b)</span><span class="cl">Answer:</span> Yes!</p>
<p class="bas indent2"><span class="nm">1.</span><span class="cl">(R. Elazar):</span> If a Shechiv Mera went from one illness to another (and died), if he gave a gift, it is valid.</p>
<p class="bas indent1"><span class="nm">(c)</span><span class="cl">(Rabah and Rava):</span> If a Shechiv Mera gave a Get, he cannot retract if he recovers. This is a decree, lest people think that a Get can work after the husband dies.</p>
<p class="bas indent1"><span class="nm">(d)</span><span class="cl">Question:</span> Can it be that (if he retracts, mid'Oraisa the retraction is valid, so) the Get is Pasul, and Chachamim decree that she is considered divorced?!</p>
<p class="bas indent1"><span class="nm">(e)</span><span class="cl">Answer:</span> Yes! Everyone who is Mekadesh a woman intends that the Kidushin be like Chachamim say. Chachamim make such a Get to work by saying that the Kidushin was void retroactively.</p>
<p class="bas subject"><span class="nm">2)</span>EXCEPTIONAL <i>ONSIM</i></p>
<p class="bas indent1"><span class="nm">(a)</span><span class="cl">(Beraisa):</span> If one said 'this is your Get from today if I die from this sickness', and the house caved in on him or he was bitten by a snake, the Get is Pasul;</p>
<p class="bas indent2"><span class="nm">1.</span>If he said '...if I do not recover from this sickness' and the house caved in on him or he was bitten by a snake, the Get is valid.</p>
<p class="bas indent1"><span class="nm">(b)</span><span class="cl">Question:</span> Why is the law different in the Seifa?</p>
<p class="bas indent1"><span class="nm">(c)</span><span class="cl">Answer (Chachamim of Eretz Yisrael):</span> We did not learn (that the Get is valid) when a lion ate him. (The Seifa is mistaken.)</p>
<p class="bas indent1"><span class="nm">(d)</span>A case occurred in which Reuven sold land to Shimon, and accepted Acharayus (responsibility) to compensate him for any Ones (an unavoidable loss of the land). A river was rerouted through the land.</p>
<p class="bas indent1"><span class="nm">(e)</span><span class="cl">Ravina:</span> He accepted Acharayus for any Ones!</p>
<p class="bas indent1"><span class="nm">(f)</span><span class="cl">Rav Acha bar Tachlifa and Rava:</span> This is an exceptional Ones. (He did not accept Acharayus for such an Ones.)</p>
<p class="bas indent1"><span class="nm">(g)</span><span class="cl">Question (Ravina - Beraisa):</span> If he said '...if I do not recover from this sickness' and the house caved in on him, or he was bitten by a snake, the Get is valid.</p>
<p class="bas indent2"><span class="nm">1.</span><span class="cl">Counter-question (Rava):</span> The Reisha of that Beraisa says that the Get is Pasul!</p>
<p class="bas indent3"><span class="nm">i.</span><span class="cl">Question (Rav Acha mi'Difti):</span> Granted, there is a contradiction within the Beraisa. Does this mean that one cannot ask from it?!</p>
<p class="bas indent3"><span class="nm">ii.</span><span class="cl">Answer (Ravina):</span> Yes! Since there is a mistake in the Beraisa, we cannot rely on it. We rely on reasoning (he did not accept such an Ones).</p>
<p class="bas indent1"><span class="nm">(h)</span>Rav Papa and Rav Huna brei d'Rav Yehoshua hired sailors to transport some sesame. The workers accepted Acharayus for any Ones. The river was dammed up. They asked the sailors to pay for donkeys to take the sesame.</p>
<p class="bas indent1"><span class="nm">(i)</span><span class="cl">Rava:</span> The sailors are exempt. This is an exceptional Ones.</p>
<p class="bas subject"><span class="nm">3)</span>ONE WHO WAS SECLUDED WITH HIS CONDITIONALLY DIVORCED WIFE</p>
<p class="bas indent1"><span class="nm">(a)</span><span class="cl">(Mishnah):</span> (If a Get was given 'from today if I die',) the husband and wife may not be secluded together;</p>
<p class="bas indent2"><span class="nm">1.</span>It suffices to have anyone with them, even a slave, except for her Shifchah, for she feels no shame in front of her Shifchah.</p>
<p class="bas indent1"><span class="nm">(b)</span><span class="cl">Question:</span> What is her status in the interim?</p>
<p class="bas bbbline">73b----------------------------------------73b</p>
<p class="bas indent1"><span class="nm">(c)</span><span class="cl">Answer #1 (R. Yehudah):</span> She is fully married;</p>
<p class="bas indent1"><span class="nm">(d)</span><span class="cl">Answer #2 (R. Yosi):</span> She has the stringencies of being divorced and not divorced.</p>
<p class="bas indent1"><span class="nm">(e)</span><span class="cl">(Gemara - Beraisa):</span> If witnesses saw that they were together in the dark, or that she slept with him below the foot of the bed, we are not concerned for another matter (this will be explained). We are concerned for Zenus (extramarital relations). We are not concerned for (Bi'ah with intent for) Kidushin.</p>
<p class="bas indent1"><span class="nm">(f)</span>R. Yosi b'Rebbi Yehudah says, we are concerned even for Kidushin.</p>
<p class="bas indent1"><span class="nm">(g)</span><span class="cl">Question:</span> What does the Beraisa mean?</p>
<p class="bas indent1"><span class="nm">(h)</span><span class="cl">Answer #1 (Rav Nachman):</span> If witnesses saw that they had Bi'ah, we are concerned for Kidushin;</p>
<p class="bas indent2"><span class="nm">1.</span>If he gave her money (after Bi'ah), we are concerned for harlotry. The money was her hire. We are not concerned for Kidushin;</p>
<p class="bas indent2"><span class="nm">2.</span>R. Yosi b'Rebbi Yehudah says, even in this case we are concerned for Kidushin.</p>
<p class="bas indent1"><span class="nm">(i)</span><span class="cl">Question:</span> According to Rav Nachman, like which Tana'im in our Beraisa is Rabah's teaching?</p>
<p class="bas indent2"><span class="nm">1.</span><span class="cl">(Rabah bar bar Chanah):</span> If witnesses did not see Bi'ah, Beis Hillel and Beis Shamai agree that another Get is not needed. Beis Hillel require another Get only when witnesses saw that they had Bi'ah.</p>
<p class="bas indent1"><span class="nm">(j)</span><span class="cl">Answer:</span> His teaching is like Chachamim and like R. Yosi b'Rebbi Yehudah.</p>
<p class="bas indent1"><span class="nm">(k)</span><span class="cl">Objection (Abaye):</span> The Beraisa does not mention money!</p>
<p class="bas indent1"><span class="nm">(l)</span><span class="cl">Answer #2 (Abaye):</span> Rather, the Beraisa means that if witnesses saw that they had Bi'ah, we are concerned for Zenus. We are not concerned for Kidushin;</p>
<p class="bas indent2"><span class="nm">1.</span>R. Yosi b'Rebbi Yehudah says, we are even concerned for Kidushin.</p>
<p class="bas indent1"><span class="nm">(m)</span><span class="cl">Question:</span> According to Abaye, like whom is Rabah's teaching?</p>
<p class="bas indent1"><span class="nm">(n)</span><span class="cl">Answer:</span> It is like R. Yosi b'Rebbi Yehudah.</p>
<p class="bas indent1"><span class="nm">(o)</span><span class="cl">Objection (Rava):</span> If so, why does the Beraisa say that we are concerned even for Kidushin? (It is the only concern. Harlotry does not create any additional Isurim!)</p>
<p class="bas indent1"><span class="nm">(p)</span><span class="cl">Answer #3 (Rava):</span> Rather, R. Yosi b'Rebbi Yehudah says, even if witnesses did not see Bi'ah, we are concerned for Kidushin.</p>
<p class="bas indent1"><span class="nm">(q)</span><span class="cl">Question:</span> According to Rava, like whom is Rabah's teaching?</p>
<p class="bas indent1"><span class="nm">(r)</span><span class="cl">Answer:</span> It is not like either Tana.</p>
<p class="bas subject"><span class="nm">4)</span>A CONDITIONAL <i>GET</i></p>
<p class="bas indent1"><span class="nm">(a)</span><span class="cl">(Mishnah) Question:</span> What is her status in the interim?</p>
<p class="bas indent1"><span class="nm">(b)</span><span class="cl">Answer #1 (R. Yehudah):</span> She is fully married;</p>
<p class="bas indent1"><span class="nm">(c)</span><span class="cl">Answer #2 (R. Yosi):</span> She has the stringencies of being divorced and not divorced.</p>
<p class="bas indent1"><span class="nm">(d)</span><span class="cl">(Beraisa):</span> This applies only if he dies (from the sickness).</p>
<p class="bas indent1"><span class="nm">(e)</span><span class="cl">Question:</span> When he dies, why does the Get help? A Get cannot take effect after death!</p>
<p class="bas indent1"><span class="nm">(f)</span><span class="cl">Answer (Rabah):</span> The case is, he said '(the Get should take effect) at the last moment I am in the world' (Rashi; Tosfos - it is as if he said this).</p>
<p class="bas indent1"><span class="nm">(g)</span><span class="cl">(Beraisa - R. Yehudah):</span> In the interim, her husband has the following privileges: he receives Hefker objects that she finds and her earnings; he can annul her vows; (if she would die) he inherits her and (if he is a Kohen) becomes Tamei to engage in her burial.</p>
<p class="bas indent2"><span class="nm">1.</span>The rule is, she is like his wife in every respect, just she does not need another Get.</p>
<p class="bas indent1"><span class="nm">(h)</span>R. Meir says, if she has Bi'ah with another man, liability for this is contingent (not yet determined).</p>
<p class="bas indent1"><span class="nm">(i)</span>R. Yosi says, if she has Bi'ah with another man, it is a Safek whether they are liable for this.</p>
<p class="bas indent1"><span class="nm">(j)</span>Chachamim say, she has the stringencies of being divorced and not divorced, provided that he (eventually) dies from the sickness.</p>
<p class="bas indent1"><span class="nm">(k)</span><span class="cl">Question:</span> What do R. Meir and R. Yosi disagree about?</p>
<p class="bas indent1"><span class="nm">(l)</span><span class="cl">Answer (R. Yochanan):</span> R. Meir holds that they bring a Korban Asham Taluy (for one who is unsure whether or not he sinned) for Bi'ah. R. Yosi exempts.</p>
<p class="bas indent1"><span class="nm">(m)</span><span class="cl">Question:</span> Chachamim and R. Yosi do not disagree!</p>
<p class="bas indent1"><span class="nm">(n)</span><span class="cl">Answer:</span> They disagree about R. Zeira's law.</p>
<p class="bas indent2"><span class="nm">1.</span><span class="cl">(R. Zeira):</span> Whenever Rabanan said 'she is divorced and not divorced', he is obligated to feed her. (Chachamim obligate him; R. Yosi does not.)</p>
