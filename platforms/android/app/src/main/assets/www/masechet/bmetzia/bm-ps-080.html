<p class="bas subject"><span class="nm">1)</span>BREACHES OF CONTRACT</p>
<p class="bas indent1"><span class="nm">(a)</span><span class="cl">(Mishnah):</span> If Reuven rented a cow to plow on the mountain, and he plowed in the valley, and the blade of the plow broke, he is exempt;</p>
<p class="bas indent2"><span class="nm">1.</span>If he rented it to plow in the valley, and he plowed on the mountain and the blade broke, he is liable.</p>
<p class="bas indent1"><span class="nm">(b)</span>If he rented it to thresh legumes, and he threshed grain, he is exempt. If he rented it to thresh grain and he threshed legumes, he is liable, for legumes are slippery.</p>
<p class="bas indent1"><span class="nm">(c)</span><span class="cl">(Gemara) Question:</span> If he did not deviate, which of the workers pays?</p>
<p class="bas indent1"><span class="nm">(d)</span><span class="cl">Answer #1 (Rav Papa):</span> The one holding the plow handle pays (he should have led it straight).</p>
<p class="bas indent1"><span class="nm">(e)</span><span class="cl">Answer #2 (Rav Shisha brei d'Rav Idi):</span> The one holding the blade pays (he inserted it too deeply in the ground.</p>
<p class="bas indent1"><span class="nm">(f)</span>The Halachah follows Rav Shisha;</p>
<p class="bas indent2"><span class="nm">1.</span>If it is known that it was a rocky area, they both pay (Rashi - either may have caused it to break; Tosfos - both were negligent).</p>
<p class="bas indent1"><span class="nm">(g)</span><span class="cl">(R. Yochanan):</span> If Reuven sold a cow to Shimon, and said that it gores, bites, kicks, and crouches, and only one of these was true, this is a mistaken sale. (Since Shimon saw that the others were false, he assumed that Reuven is merely saying these so Shimon can have no complaints);</p>
<p class="bas indent2"><span class="nm">1.</span>If he mentioned the defect and another defect that is not true, the sale stands.</p>
<p class="bas indent1"><span class="nm">(h)</span><span class="cl">Support (Beraisa):</span> Reuven sold a slave to Shimon, saying she is a lunatic, epileptic, crazy - if only one of them was true, this is a mistaken sale;</p>
<p class="bas indent2"><span class="nm">1.</span>If he mentioned the defect and another defect which is not true, the sale stands.</p>
<p class="bas indent1"><span class="nm">(i)</span><span class="cl">Question (Rav Acha brei d'Rava):</span> If it had all the defects, what is the law?</p>
<p class="bas indent1"><span class="nm">(j)</span><span class="cl">Answer (Rav Mordechai):</span> Rava taught that the sale stands.</p>
<p class="bas subject"><span class="nm">2)</span>OVERLOADING</p>
<p class="bas indent1"><span class="nm">(a)</span><span class="cl">(Mishnah):</span> If Reuven rented a donkey to bring wheat on it and he brought barley (of the same weight) he is liable (for any damage), for (added) volume is difficult k'Masa'uy (like added load, i.e. weight);</p>
<p class="bas indent2"><span class="nm">1.</span>The same applies if he said that he would bring grain, and he brought straw.</p>
<p class="bas indent1"><span class="nm">(b)</span>If he said he would bring a Lesech (15 Sa'im) of wheat and he brought a Lesech of barley, he is exempt;</p>
<p class="bas indent2"><span class="nm">1.</span>If he brought a larger volume, he is liable.</p>
<p class="bas indent2"><span class="nm">2.</span><span class="cl">Question:</span> How much must he add to be liable?</p>
<p class="bas indent2"><span class="nm">3.</span><span class="cl">Answer (Sumchus):</span> If he adds one Se'ah on a camel, or three Kavim (half a Se'ah) on a donkey, he is liable.</p>
<p class="bas indent1"><span class="nm">(c)</span><span class="cl">(Gemara - Abaye):</span> The Mishnah says that added volume is difficult k'Masa'uy (like added weight);</p>
<p class="bas indent1"><span class="nm">(d)</span><span class="cl">(Rava):</span> It says that volume is difficult <i>l</i>'Masa'uy (for the load).</p>
<p class="bas indent2"><span class="nm">1.</span>According to Abaye, volume is like weight. He is liable for three extra Kavim, even if the weight is less;</p>
<p class="bas indent2"><span class="nm">2.</span>According to Rava, volume is difficult for the load. He is liable for three extra Kavim if the weight is the same.</p>
<p class="bas indent1"><span class="nm">(e)</span><span class="cl">Question (against Rava - Mishnah):</span> If he said he would bring a Lesech of wheat and he brought a Lesech of barley, he is exempt. If he brought a larger volume, he is liable.</p>
<p class="bas indent2"><span class="nm">1.</span><span class="cl">Suggestion:</span> He is liable if he added three Kavim (even though the entire load weighs less than what he said)!</p>
<p class="bas indent1"><span class="nm">(f)</span><span class="cl">Answer:</span> No, he is liable if he added a Se'ah (together, a Lesech and a Se'ah of barley weigh as much as a Lesech of wheat).</p>
<p class="bas indent1"><span class="nm">(g)</span><span class="cl">Question (Seifa):</span> How much must he add to be liable? Sumchus says, one Se'ah on a camel, or three Kavim on a donkey.</p>
<p class="bas indent1"><span class="nm">(h)</span><span class="cl">Answer:</span> It means, if he brought wheat (or barley) as he said, he is liable for adding one Se'ah on a camel, or three Kavim on a donkey.</p>
<p class="bas indent1"><span class="nm">(i)</span><span class="cl">Question (against Abaye - Beraisa):</span> If he said that he would bring a Lesech (15 Sa'im) of wheat and he brought 16 Sa'im of barley, he is liable;</p>
<p class="bas bbbline">80b----------------------------------------80b</p>
<p class="bas indent2"><span class="nm">1.</span><span class="cl">Inference:</span> He is not liable for an extra half Se'ah! (We do not ask against Rava. He could say that this amount of barley weighs as much as 15 and a half of wheat. Above (f), the Gemara said that a Se'ah of barley weighs as much as three Kavim of wheat. Rava could argue.)</p>
<p class="bas indent1"><span class="nm">(j)</span><span class="cl">Version #1 (Rashi) Answer (Abaye):</span> The Beraisa discusses 16 Sa'im that were leveled off (this equals 15 and a half Sa'im unleveled).</p>
<p class="bas indent1"><span class="nm">(k)</span><span class="cl">Version #2 (Ge'onim) Answer (Abaye):</span> The Beraisa discusses 16 worm-eaten Sa'im (since they are much lighter then wheat, he is liable only for 16).</p>
<p class="bas indent1"><span class="nm">(l)</span><span class="cl">(Beraisa):</span> The quantities of overloading are a Kav onto the load on a person, a Lesech on a small ship, a Kor (30 Sa'im) on a normal ship, and three Korim on a large ship.</p>
<p class="bas indent1"><span class="nm">(m)</span><span class="cl">Question:</span> A person should know if he is overloaded, and take off the extra!</p>
<p class="bas indent1"><span class="nm">(n)</span><span class="cl">Answer #1 (Abaye):</span> The case is, he fell before he had time to take it off.</p>
<p class="bas indent1"><span class="nm">(o)</span><span class="cl">Answer #2 (Rava):</span> The Beraisa teaches that one who overloads this amount must pay extra.</p>
<p class="bas indent1"><span class="nm">(p)</span><span class="cl">Answer #3 (Rav Ashi):</span> The carrier did not know that he was overloaded. He attributed his pain to weakness.</p>
<p class="bas indent1"><span class="nm">(q)</span><span class="cl">(Beraisa):</span> The quantity is a Kor on a normal ship.</p>
<p class="bas indent1"><span class="nm">(r)</span><span class="cl">(Rav Papa):</span> (The quantity is always one part in 30.) We learn that a normal ship carries 30 Korim.</p>
<p class="bas indent2"><span class="nm">1.</span>This is pertinent to commerce.</p>
<p class="bas subject"><span class="nm">3)</span>LIABILITY OF CRAFTSMEN</p>
<p class="bas indent1"><span class="nm">(a)</span><span class="cl">(Mishnah):</span> All craftsmen are paid Shomrim.</p>
<p class="bas indent1"><span class="nm">(b)</span>Anyone who told the owner 'take your item and pay' is a Shomer Chinam (one who guards for free).</p>
<p class="bas indent1"><span class="nm">(c)</span>If Reuven told Shimon 'guard for me and I will guard for you', he is a Shomer Sachar (one who is paid to guard).</p>
<p class="bas indent1"><span class="nm">(d)</span>If Reuven told Shimon 'guard this for me', and Shimon said 'leave it in front of me', he is a Shomer Chinam.</p>
<p class="bas indent1"><span class="nm">(e)</span>If Reuven lent Shimon and took a security, he is a Shomer Sachar on the security;</p>
<p class="bas indent1"><span class="nm">(f)</span><span class="cl">R. Yehudah distinguishes:</span> he is a Shomer Chinam if he lent to him money, and he is a Shomer Sachar if he lent him to produce (for then he benefits; he is spared losses due to rotting).</p>
<p class="bas indent1"><span class="nm">(g)</span>Aba Sha'ul says, a lender can rent out an Ani's security and deduct the money from the loan - this is like returning an Aveidah.</p>
<p class="bas indent1"><span class="nm">(h)</span><span class="cl">(Gemara) Suggestion:</span> Our Mishnah is unlike R. Meir. (A craftsman is like a renter, for he benefits the owner and also he benefits (employment) from the object, and the Mishnah says that he is a Shomer Sachar).</p>
<p class="bas indent2"><span class="nm">1.</span><span class="cl">(Beraisa - R. Meir):</span> A renter is liable like a Shomer Chinam;</p>
<p class="bas indent2"><span class="nm">2.</span>R. Yehudah says, he is liable like a Shomer Sachar.</p>
<p class="bas indent1"><span class="nm">(i)</span><span class="cl">Rejection #1:</span> The Mishnah is even according to R. Meir. A craftsman is a Shomer Sachar because he is happy that the owner chose to hire him.</p>
<p class="bas indent1"><span class="nm">(j)</span><span class="cl">Objection:</span> If so, a renter should also be a Shomer Sachar, for he is happy that the owner chose to rent to him!</p>
<p class="bas indent1"><span class="nm">(k)</span><span class="cl">Rejection #2:</span> The Mishnah is even like R. Meir. A craftsman is a Shomer Sachar because he is happy that the owner gave him a bit more than the usual wage.</p>
<p class="bas indent1"><span class="nm">(l)</span><span class="cl">Objection:</span> If so, a renter should also be a Shomer Sachar, when the owner rented to him for a bit less than usual!</p>
<p class="bas indent1"><span class="nm">(m)</span><span class="cl">Rejection #3:</span> The Mishnah is even like R. Meir. A craftsman is a Shomer Sachar because he benefits from having the object to be security for his wages.</p>
<p class="bas indent1"><span class="nm">(n)</span><span class="cl">Rejection #4:</span> The Mishnah is like R. Meir and unlike R. Yehudah, according to Rabah bar Avuha's text of the Beraisa;</p>
<p class="bas indent2"><span class="nm">1.</span><span class="cl">(Rabah bar Avuha - Beraisa - R. Meir):</span> A renter is liable like a Shomer Sachar;</p>
<p class="bas indent2"><span class="nm">2.</span>R. Yehudah says, he is liable like a Shomer Chinam.</p>
<p class="bas indent1"><span class="nm">(o)</span><span class="cl">(Mishnah):</span> Anyone who told the owner 'take your item and pay' is a Shomer Chinam.</p>
<p class="bas indent1"><span class="nm">(p)</span><span class="cl">(Mishnah):</span> If Reuven told Shimon 'send your animal (for me to borrow)' and it died on the way, Reuven is liable;</p>
<p class="bas indent2"><span class="nm">1.</span>Similarly, if Reuven sent it back and it died on the way, he is liable.</p>
<p class="bas indent1"><span class="nm">(q)</span><span class="cl">(Rafram bar Papa):</span> This is only if he returned it within the time he borrowed it for. After this, he is exempt.</p>
