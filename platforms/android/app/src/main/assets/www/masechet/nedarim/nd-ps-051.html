<p class="bas indent1"><span class="nm">(a)</span>Bar Kapara took a big basket, sealed it with tar and put it on his head. He asked Rebbi for the 40 measures of wheat 'that you owe me (for what I lent to you).' Rebbi laughed.</p>
<p class="bas indent2"><span class="nm">1.</span><span class="cl">Rebbi:</span> I warned you not to make me laugh!</p>
<p class="bas indent2"><span class="nm">2.</span><span class="cl">Bar Kapara:</span> I meant, the 40 measures that you owe (promised) to me. (Ran. Maharsha - the first time, Bar Kapara asked for what Rebbi promised him. Rebbi said that he forfeited that. Bar Kapara then asked for what he had lent to Rebbi, to make him laugh.)</p>
<p class="bas indent1"><span class="nm">(b)</span><span class="cl">Bar Kapara (to Rebbi's daughter):</span> Tomorrow I will drink wine while your father dances and your mother sings (Rashi - mixes drinks for me).</p>
<p class="bas indent1"><span class="nm">(c)</span>Ben Elasha, Rebbi's son-in-law, was very wealthy. He invited Bar Kapara to a banquet in honor of the marriage of Rebbi's son, R. Shimon.</p>
<p class="bas indent1"><span class="nm">(d)</span><span class="cl">Question (Bar Kapara, of Rebbi):</span> Why is homosexuality called To'evah?</p>
<p class="bas indent2"><span class="nm">1.</span>Bar Kapara refuted every answer Rebbi gave.</p>
<p class="bas indent2"><span class="nm">2.</span><span class="cl">Rebbi:</span> How do you answer?</p>
<p class="bas indent2"><span class="nm">3.</span>Bar Kapara asked Rebbi to have his wife mix a drink for him; she did. He promised to answer if Rebbi will dance; Rebbi danced.</p>

<p class="bas indent1"><span class="nm">(f)</span><span class="cl">Question (Bar Kapara):</span> Why is bestiality called Tevel?</p>
<p class="bas indent2"><span class="nm">1.</span>Bar Kapara promised to answer if Rebbi's wife will mix another drink for him and Rebbi will dance again; they did.</p>
<p class="bas indent1"><span class="nm">(g)</span><span class="cl">Answer (Bar Kapara):</span> Are TaVLin (spices) in it? Why does a woman prefer it to human Bi'ah?</p>
<p class="bas indent1"><span class="nm">(h)</span><span class="cl">Question (Rebbi):</span> Why is illicit Bi'ah called Zimah?</p>
<p class="bas indent2"><span class="nm">1.</span><span class="cl">Bar Kapara:</span> If you do like before, I will tell you.</p>
<p class="bas indent1"><span class="nm">(i)</span><span class="cl">Answer (Bar Kapara):</span> Zo MAh Hi (what is this, i.e. from whom is this fetus?)</p>
<p class="bas indent1"><span class="nm">(j)</span>Ben Elasha could not bear seeing Rebbi and Rebbi's wife humiliated; he left with his wife.</p>
<p class="bas indent1"><span class="nm">(k)</span><span class="cl">Question:</span> What is the source that Ben Elasha was wealthy? (We said so above (b).)</p>
<p class="bas indent1"><span class="nm">(l)</span><span class="cl">Answer (Beraisa):</span> Ben Elasha did not squander his money for naught. Rather, it was to learn the haircut of the Kohen Gadol - "Kasom Yichsemu" (they will cut like Kusemes (spelt); each grain reaches to the next. Alternatively, they will not shave nor grow long hair (the Reisha of the verse), rather, something in between.)</p>
<p class="bas indent2"><span class="nm">1.</span><span class="cl">(Beraisa):</span> It is cut like Lulianis.</p>
<p class="bas indent2"><span class="nm">2.</span><span class="cl">(Rav Yehudah):</span> This is a beautiful haircut.</p>
<p class="bas indent3"><span class="nm">i.</span><span class="cl">(Rava):</span> Each hair ends at the root of the next hair.</p>

<p class="bas indent1"><span class="nm">(d)</span><span class="cl">Answer #2 (Rav Ashi):</span> It is a gourd wrapped in REMeTZ (hot ashes).</p>
<p class="bas indent1"><span class="nm">(e)</span><span class="cl">Question (Ravina - Beraisa - R. Nechemyah):</span> Aramis gourd is Mitzri gourd. It is forbidden to plant this with Greek or Remutzah gourd (for they are different species).</p>

<p class="bas indent1"><span class="nm">(c)</span><span class="cl">(Gemara - Beraisa):</span> If he forbade 'what enters a pot', he is forbidden even things cooked in a frying pan, for they were first cooked in a pot (this was the custom);</p>

<p class="bas indent1"><span class="nm">(l)</span><span class="cl">Answer #1 (Abaye):</span> He was swallowed by a big fish. It spat him up, and he was swallowed by a small fish.</p>
