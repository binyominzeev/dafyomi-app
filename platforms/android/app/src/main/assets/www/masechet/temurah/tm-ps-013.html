<p class="bas subject"><span class="nm">1)</span>WHAT MAKES <i>TEMURAH</i>?</p>
<p class="bas indent1"><span class="nm">(a)</span><span class="cl">(Mishnah):</span> Temurah cannot make Temurah.</p>
<p class="bas indent1"><span class="nm">(b)</span><span class="cl">Question:</span> What is the reason?</p>
<p class="bas indent1"><span class="nm">(c)</span><span class="cl">Answer:</span> "(Hu) u'Semuraso (Yihyeh Kodesh)", but not Temurah of the Temurah.</p>
<p class="bas indent1"><span class="nm">(d)</span><span class="cl">(Mishnah):</span> Vlados Kodshim do not make Temurah.</p>
<p class="bas indent1"><span class="nm">(e)</span>That is because it says "Hu". It (initial Hekdesh) makes Temurah, but its child does not.</p>
<p class="bas indent1"><span class="nm">(f)</span><span class="cl">(Mishnah - R. Yehudah):</span> Vlados Kodshim make Temurah.</p>
<p class="bas indent1"><span class="nm">(g)</span>He expounds "Yihyeh" to include the child;</p>
<p class="bas indent1"><span class="nm">(h)</span>Chachamim expound "Yihyeh" to include Shogeg like Mezid. (If he made Temurah on a different animal than intended, it takes effect.)</p>
<p class="bas indent1"><span class="nm">(i)</span><span class="cl">(Mishnah):</span> Birds and Menachos do not make Temurah. The Torah says only that "Behemah" makes Temurah.</p>
<p class="bas indent1"><span class="nm">(j)</span>The Tzibur or partners cannot make Temurah. "Lo Yachalifenu v'Lo Yamir" (singular) teaches that only an individual can make Temurah;</p>
<p class="bas indent1"><span class="nm">(k)</span>Kodshei Bedek ha'Bayis cannot make Temurah.</p>
<p class="bas indent1"><span class="nm">(l)</span><span class="cl">Question (R. Shimon):</span> Why is Temurah repeated in the Parshah of Ma'aser Behemah? (The Torah already taught that Kodshim make Temurah. Ma'aser is included!)</p>
<p class="bas indent1"><span class="nm">(m)</span><span class="cl">Answer:</span> (It equates Temurah to Ma'aser.) Just like Ma'aser is a Korban Yachid and Kodshei Mizbe'ach, also Temurah applies only to them, but not to Korbanos Tzibur or Kodshei Bedek ha'Bayis.</p>
<p class="bas indent1"><span class="nm">(n)</span><span class="cl">(Gemara - Beraisa #1) Suggestion:</span> Perhaps Kodshei Bedek ha'Bayis can make Temurah!</p>
<p class="bas indent2"><span class="nm">1.</span><span class="cl">Rejection:</span> "Korban" excludes Bedek ha'Bayis, which is not called Korban.</p>
<p class="bas indent1"><span class="nm">(o)</span><span class="cl">Contradiction (Beraisa #2) Suggestion:</span> It says "Korban" (regarding Shechutei Chutz). Perhaps one is liable even for Bedek ha'Bayis, for it is called Korban - "va'Nakrev Es Korban Hash-m"!</p>
<p class="bas indent2"><span class="nm">1.</span><span class="cl">Rejection:</span> "V'El Pesach Ohel Mo'ed Lo Hevi'o" obligates only for something that may be offered in the Mikdash.</p>
<p class="bas indent2"><span class="nm">2.</span><span class="cl">Summation of question:</span> Beraisa #2 says that Kodshei Bedek ha'Bayis are called Korban!</p>
<p class="bas indent1"><span class="nm">(p)</span><span class="cl">Answer #1 (R. Chanina):</span> Beraisa #1 is like Chachamim (who do not need a Hekesh to teach that Bedek ha'Bayis cannot make Temurah). Beraisa #2 is like R. Shimon.</p>
<p class="bas indent1"><span class="nm">(q)</span><span class="cl">Question:</span> Chachamim should agree that they are called Korban, for it says "va'Nakrev Es Korban Hash-m"!</p>
<p class="bas indent1"><span class="nm">(r)</span><span class="cl">Answer:</span> They are called "Korban Hash-m". They are not called "Korban <i>la</i>'Shem" (i.e. a standard Korban, that is offered to Hash-m).</p>
<p class="bas subject"><span class="nm">2)</span>THE HEKESH TO MA'ASER</p>
<p class="bas indent1"><span class="nm">(a)</span><span class="cl">(Beraisa) Question:</span> (Why does it say regarding Ma'aser) "Lo Yevaker Bein Tov la'Ra <i>v'Lo Yemirenu</i>"? It already says (regarding Kodshim) "Lo Yachalifenu v'Lo Yamir Oso Tov b'Ra"!</p>
<p class="bas indent2"><span class="nm">1.</span><span class="cl">Answer:</span> "Lo Yachalifenu v'Lo Yamir" could apply to Korbanos Yachid and Korbanos Tzibur, to Kodshei Mizbe'ach and Bedek ha'Bayis. Therefore, it says "Lo Yevaker";</p>
<p class="bas indent2"><span class="nm">2.</span><span class="cl">R. Shimon:</span> The Parshah of Temurah already applied to Ma'aser. It is repeated regarding Ma'aser to equate Temurah to Ma'aser;</p>
<p class="bas indent3"><span class="nm">i.</span>Just like Ma'aser is a Korban Yachid, Kodshei Mizbe'ach, a Chovah (this will be explained) and partners do not bring it, also Temurah applies only to such Korbanos.</p>
<p class="bas bbbline">13b----------------------------------------13b</p>
<p class="bas indent2"><span class="nm">3.</span>Rebbi says, Parshas Temurah is repeated regarding Ma'aser to teach that Temuras Shemo (a different animal, i.e. the ninth or 11th, was called Asiri instead of the tenth) and Temuras Gufo (regular Temurah, i.e he said 'this animal is Tachas Ma'aser') both apply to Ma'aser;</p>
<p class="bas indent3"><span class="nm">i.</span>Temuras Shemo is offered (the 11th is like Shelamim in every way). Temuras Gufo is not offered (but in all other ways it is like Ma'aser);</p>
<p class="bas indent3"><span class="nm">ii.</span>Temuras Shemo may be redeemed. Temuras Gufo may not be redeemed;</p>
<p class="bas indent3"><span class="nm">iii.</span>Temuras Gufo takes effect (makes full Kedushah) on a Tam or Ba'al Mum. Temuras Shemo takes effect only on a Tam.</p>
<p class="bas indent1"><span class="nm">(b)</span><span class="cl">Version #1 (R. Gershom) Question:</span> Why does Temuras Shemo take effect only on a Tam? Because an additional kind of Temurah applies to Ma'aser, should it be less inclusive (than Temuras Gufo, which takes effect even on a Ba'al Mum)?!</p>
<p class="bas indent1"><span class="nm">(c)</span><span class="cl">Answer:</span> Yes! We would say that only what is written about Temuras Shemo (it takes effect on an animal Kosher for Shelamim) applies to it. (Tzon Kodashim explains that the first explanation of Rashi is like Version #1. We explain the two versions in Rashi like Tosfos.)</p>
<p class="bas indent1"><span class="nm">(d)</span><span class="cl">Version #2 (Rashi) Question:</span> Why must a verse teach that Temuras Gufo of Ma'aser takes effect even on a Ba'al Mum? Because Temuras Shemo applies to Ma'aser, should we say that Temuras Gufo applies to Ma'aser less than other Korbanos?!</p>
<p class="bas indent1"><span class="nm">(e)</span><span class="cl">Answer:</span> Yes! We would say that only what is written about Ma'aser (Temurah (e.g. Shemo) takes effect on a Tam) applies to it.</p>
<p class="bas indent1"><span class="nm">(f)</span><span class="cl">Version #3 (Rashi) Question:</span> Why must a verse teach that Temuras Gufo applies to Ma'aser? Because Temuras Shemo applies to Ma'aser, would we say that Temuras Gufo (which applies to all other Korbanos) does not?!</p>
<p class="bas indent1"><span class="nm">(g)</span><span class="cl">Answer:</span> Yes! We would say that only what is written about Ma'aser (Temuras Shemo) applies to it. (end of Version #3)</p>
<p class="bas indent1"><span class="nm">(h)</span><span class="cl">Question:</span> Why would we think this?</p>
<p class="bas indent1"><span class="nm">(i)</span><span class="cl">Answer:</span> Whenever the Torah gives new laws to a particular case which was part of a general rule, the laws of the general rule no longer apply.</p>
<p class="bas subject"><span class="nm">3)</span>THE <i>NEDAVAH</i> THAT DOES NOT MAKE <i>TEMURAH</i></p>
<p class="bas indent1"><span class="nm">(a)</span><span class="cl">Question (Rav Nachman bar Yitzchak):</span> R. Shimon said that Temurah applies only to Chovah. Does Olas Chovah make Temurah, but not Olas Nedavah?!</p>
<p class="bas indent1"><span class="nm">(b)</span><span class="cl">Answer (Rava):</span> Once someone makes a Nedavah, it becomes a Chovah (he must offer it to avoid transgressing "Bal Te'acher"), it makes Temurah;</p>
<p class="bas indent2"><span class="nm">1.</span>R. Shimon means that Olah that comes from Mosaros (e.g. of Asham) is Nedavah, and does not make Temurah.</p>
<p class="bas indent1"><span class="nm">(c)</span><span class="cl">Question:</span> What is R. Shimon's opinion about an Olah from Mosar?</p>
<p class="bas indent2"><span class="nm">1.</span>If he holds like the opinion that it is Nidvas Tzibur, obviously it cannot make Temurah!</p>
<p class="bas indent1"><span class="nm">(d)</span><span class="cl">Answer:</span> He holds like the opinion that it is Nidvas Yachid.</p>
<p class="bas indent1"><span class="nm">(e)</span><span class="cl">Question:</span> R. Eliezer holds that it is Nidvas Yachid. R. Eliezer explicitly says that it can make Temurah!</p>
<p class="bas indent1"><span class="nm">(f)</span><span class="cl">Answer:</span> He agrees with R. Eliezer that it is Nidvas Yachid, but argues with him about Temurah.</p>
<p class="bas indent1"><span class="nm">(g)</span><span class="cl">Question:</span> R. Avin asked (according to the opinion that one cannot make Temurah more than once on one animal), if Reuven was Makdish "A" for his Asham and made "B" Temurah on it:</p>
<p class="bas indent2"><span class="nm">1.</span><span class="cl">Question #1:</span> If "A" got a Mum, he redeemed it onto "C", can "C" make Temurah?</p>
<p class="bas indent2"><span class="nm">2.</span><span class="cl">Question #2:</span> If he lost "A" and brought "C" for his Asham, and "A" was found and Nitak to Olah, can it make Temurah?</p>
<p class="bas indent2"><span class="nm">3.</span><span class="cl">Question:</span> According to whom does R. Avin ask? (We understood that it is according to R. Shimon, who holds that an animal cannot make Temurah more than once.)</p>
<p class="bas indent3"><span class="nm">i.</span>It cannot be according to R. Shimon. He holds that an Olah from Mosar cannot make Temurah!</p>
<p class="bas indent1"><span class="nm">(h)</span><span class="cl">Answer:</span> R. Avin asks, if there is a Tana who holds like R. Shimon that an animal cannot make Temurah more than once, and holds like R. Eliezer, that Olah from Mosar makes Temurah:</p>
<p class="bas indent2"><span class="nm">1.</span>After Temurah was made (on the first animal,) can a second animal of the same Kedushah make Temurah?</p>
<p class="bas indent2"><span class="nm">2.</span>If you will say that it cannot, can the same animal make Temurah again when it gets a new Kedushah?</p>
<p class="bas indent2"><span class="nm">3.</span>His questions are not resolved.</p>
