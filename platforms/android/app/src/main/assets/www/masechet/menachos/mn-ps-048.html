<div class="subject"><span class="nm">1)</span><p>SHECHITAH FOR TOO MANY LOAVES</p></div>
<div class="indent1"><span class="nm">(a)</span><p><span class="cl">(Beraisa):</span> If the two lambs were slaughtered for (i.e. to Mekadesh) four loaves, we take two loaves and wave them with the lambs. We redeem the other loaves are eat them.</p></div>
<div class="indent1"><span class="nm">(b)</span><p><span class="cl">(Rabanan):</span> This is unlike Rebbi. Rebbi holds that Shechitah is Mekadesh, so we cannot redeem the other loaves!</p></div>
<div class="indent2"><span class="nm">1.</span><p>If they (the extra two; Rashi - all) are taken outside the Azarah to be redeemed, they (Rashi - the Kosher ones) are Nifsalim due to Yotzei;</p></div>
<div class="indent2"><span class="nm">2.</span><p>If one redeems them inside, he brings Chulin b'Azarah!</p></div>
<div class="indent1"><span class="nm">(c)</span><p><span class="cl">(Rav Chisda):</span> Really, it is like Rebbi. They are redeemed inside;</p></div>
<div class="indent2"><span class="nm">1.</span><p>Kodesh was brought into the Azarah. Through redemption it automatically becomes Chulin. (This is not considered bringing Chulin b'Azarah.)</p></div>
<div class="indent1"><span class="nm">(d)</span><p><span class="cl">Question (Ravina - Beraisa):</span> They are redeemed outside.</p></div>
<div class="indent1"><span class="nm">(e)</span><p><span class="cl">Answer:</span> Surely, this is like R. Elazar b'Rebbi Shimon. According to Rebbi, they would be Nifsalim due to Yotzei!</p></div>
<div class="indent1"><span class="nm">(f)</span><p><span class="cl">Suggestion (Rav Acha brei d'Rava):</span> The Beraisa refutes the following teaching of R. Yochanan!</p></div>
<div class="indent2"><span class="nm">1.</span><p><span class="cl">(Chizkiyah):</span> If a Todah (which is brought with 40 loaves) was slaughtered for 80 loaves, 40 of them become Kodesh;</p></div>
<div class="indent2"><span class="nm">2.</span><p><span class="cl">(R. Yochanan):</span> None of them become Kodesh.</p></div>
<div class="indent1"><span class="nm">(g)</span><p><span class="cl">Answer:</span> We learned that R. Yochanan agrees if the Shochet said that he intends to Mekadesh only 40 of them, 40 become Kodesh. The Beraisa discusses one who said that he intends to Mekadesh only two loaves.</p></div>
<div class="subject"><span class="nm">2)</span><p>TRANSGRESSING FOR THE SAKE OF TIKUN</p></div>
<div class="indent1"><span class="nm">(a)</span><p><span class="cl">(R. Chanina of Tirasa - Beraisa):</span> If four lambs were slaughtered for two loaves, we take (the blood of) two lambs and do Zerikah Lo Lishmah (l'Shem Shelamim. This permits Haktaras Eimurim and eating the meat.)</p></div>
<div class="indent2"><span class="nm">1.</span><p>If not (rather, we are Zorek the first two Lishmah), the latter lambs must be burned. (They were Nidchim after Shechitah Lishmah.)</p></div>
<div class="indent1"><span class="nm">(b)</span><p><span class="cl">Question (R. Yochanan):</span> Do we transgress (throw the blood Lo Lishmah) in order to gain (salvage the other lambs)?!</p></div>
<div class="indent2"><span class="nm">1.</span><p><span class="cl">(Mishnah - R. Eliezer):</span> If Ivrei (limbs of) a Chatas were mixed with Ivrei Olah, we burn all of them on the Mizbe'ach. (Even though Ivrei Chatas may not be burned for Re'ach Nicho'ach,) we consider the Chatas to be like wood;</p></div>
<div class="indent2"><span class="nm">2.</span><p>Chachamim say, we wait for Ibur Tzurah, then all are burned in Beis ha'Sereifah (a place outside the Azarah for burning Pasul Kodshim).</p></div>
<div class="indent2"><span class="nm">3.</span><p>We do not transgress (to be Maktir all the limbs, including Ivrei Chatas) in order to gain (to be Maktir Ivrei Olah)!</p></div>
<div class="indent1"><span class="nm">(c)</span><p><span class="cl">Answer:</span> We transgress in (a matter in order to gain in the same matter, e.g. in) a Chatas in order to gain in a Chatas. We do not transgress in a Chatas in order to gain in an Olah.</p></div>
<div class="indent1"><span class="nm">(d)</span><p><span class="cl">Question:</span> We do not transgress in a matter in order to gain in the same matter!</p></div>
<div class="indent2"><span class="nm">1.</span><p><span class="cl">(Beraisa):</span> If Kivsei Atzeres were slaughtered Lo Lishmah, or if they were slaughtered before or after the proper time (Shavu'os), we are Zorek the blood and eat the meat;</p></div>
<div class="indent2"><span class="nm">2.</span><p>If Shavu'os was on Shabbos, we are not Zorek the blood;</p></div>
<div class="indent3"><span class="nm">i.</span><p>If Zerikah was done, this permits Haktaras ha'Chelev at night.</p></div>
<div class="indent2"><span class="nm">3.</span><p>We do not transgress (to do Zerikah l'Chatchilah) to gain!</p></div>
<div class="indent1"><span class="nm">(e)</span><p><span class="cl">Answer:</span> We would transgress on Shabbos to gain on Shabbos. Here, the gain (Haktaras ha'Chelev) is on Motzei Shabbos, so it is forbidden.</p></div>
<div class="indent1"><span class="nm">(f)</span><p><span class="cl">Question:</span> We do transgress in a matter in order to gain in a different matter!</p></div>
<div class="indent2"><span class="nm">1.</span><p><span class="cl">(Mishnah):</span> If a barrel of Terumah wine broke in the upper Gas (winepress) and it is about to fall into Tamei Chulin below, R. Eliezer and R. Yehoshua agree that if one can save a Revi'is in Taharah, he must do so;</p></div>
<div class="indent2"><span class="nm">2.</span><p>If he cannot, then -</p></div>
<div class="indent3"><span class="nm">i.</span><p>R. Eliezer says, he must allow the Terumah to fall (even though it will become Tamei, mix with all the wine and forbid the mixture even to a Kohen). He may not actively be Metamei it (e.g. to catch it in a Tamei Kli);</p></div>
<div class="bbbline">48b----------------------------------------48b</p></div>
<div class="indent3"><span class="nm">ii.</span><p>R. Yehoshua says, (in order to save the Chulin) he may actively be Metamei the Terumah.</p></div>
<div class="indent1"><span class="nm">(g)</span><p><span class="cl">Answer:</span> There is different, for the Terumah will become Tamei in any event.</p></div>
<div class="indent1"><span class="nm">(h)</span><p><span class="cl">(Rav Yitzchak - Beraisa):</span> If Kivsei Atzeres were slaughtered improperly (Lo Lishmah; alternatively, they were too old) they are Pesulim. They are burned in Beis ha'Sereifah after Ibur Tzurah.</p></div>
<div class="indent1"><span class="nm">(i)</span><p><span class="cl">Rav Nachman:</span> You equate Shalmei Tzibur to Chatas, and disqualify them. Tana d'Vei Levi equates them to Shalmei Nedavah, and he is Machshir!</p></div>
<div class="indent2"><span class="nm">1.</span><p><span class="cl">(Levi - Beraisa):</span> If a Shalmei Nazir was slaughtered improperly, one may eat it for one day and a night. We do not bring bread with it. The law of Zero'a Beshelah (the foreleg of Ayil Nazir is cooked and given to the Kohen) does not apply.</p></div>
<div class="indent1"><span class="nm">(j)</span><p><span class="cl">Question (Beraisa):</span> If a second year animal was brought for an Asham that must be in its first year, or vice-versa, it is Pasul. It is burned in Beis ha'Sereifah after Ibur Tzurah;</p></div>
<div class="indent2"><span class="nm">1.</span><p>However, if a second year Olah was brought for Olas Nazir, Yoledes or Metzora, it is Kosher.</p></div>
<div class="indent2"><span class="nm">2.</span><p>The general rule is, anything Kosher for Olas Nedavah (e.g. whether it is one or two years old) is Kosher (at least b'Di'eved) for Olas Chovah. (According to Rav Yitzchak, we should learn Olas Chovah from Chatas Chovah, and disqualify if it is too old! Asham is different, for it is never brought for a Nedavah.)</p></div>
<div class="indent3"><span class="nm">i.</span><p>Anything that disqualifies Chatas disqualifies an Asham, except for Lo Lishmah.</p></div>
<div class="indent1"><span class="nm">(k)</span><p><span class="cl">Answer:</span> That Beraisa is like Tana d'Vei Levi (who learns Chovah from Nedavah, and not from Chovah):</p></div>
<div class="indent1"><span class="nm">(l)</span><p><span class="cl">Question (Levi's Beraisa):</span> If Asham Nazir or Asham Metzora was slaughtered Lo Lishmah, it is Kosher. The owner was not Yotzei.</p></div>
<div class="indent2"><span class="nm">1.</span><p>If the owner was Mechusar Zeman, or the sheep was two years old (a yearling is required), it is Pasul.</p></div>
<div class="indent2"><span class="nm">2.</span><p>Levi does not learn (Asham, which is Chovah) from Shelamim (Nedavah)!</p></div>
<div class="indent1"><span class="nm">(m)</span><p><span class="cl">Answer:</span> He learns Shelamim (Chovah) from Shelamim (Nedavah), he does not learn Asham from Shelamim.</p></div>
<div class="indent1"><span class="nm">(n)</span><p><span class="cl">Question:</span> If he learns Shelamim from Shelamim, he should also learn Asham from Asham, i.e. Asham Nazir and Asham Metzora from Asham Gezeilos and Asham Me'ilos (and be Machshir a second year ram), and also Asham Gezeilos and Asham Me'ilos from Asham Nazir and Asham Metzora (and be Machshir a yearling lamb for these!)</p></div>
<div class="indent1"><span class="nm">(o)</span><p><span class="cl">Answer (Rav Simi Bar Ashi):</span> We learn b'Di'eved from b'Di'eved, but not from what is l'Chatchilah.</p></div>
<div class="indent1"><span class="nm">(p)</span><p><span class="cl">Question:</span> We do learn b'Di'eved from l'Chatchilah!</p></div>
<div class="indent2"><span class="nm">1.</span><p><span class="cl">(Beraisa) Question:</span> What is the source that if Yotzei (Eimurim that left the Azarah) were brought on the Mizbe'ach, we do not take them down?</p></div>
<div class="indent2"><span class="nm">2.</span><p><span class="cl">Answer:</span> Because Yotzei is Kosher on a Bamah, it is not taken down from the Mizbe'ach.</p></div>
<div class="indent1"><span class="nm">(q)</span><p><span class="cl">Answer:</span> The Tana really learns from "Zos Toras ha'Olah" (and not from its Hechsher on a Bamah.)</p></div>
