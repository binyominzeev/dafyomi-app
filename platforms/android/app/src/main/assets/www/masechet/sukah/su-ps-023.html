<div class="subject"><span class="nm">1)</span><p>A MOVING SUKAH</p></div>
<div class="indent1"><span class="nm">(a)</span><p><span class="cl">Question:</span> Who is the Tana who permits a Sukah on a wagon or boat?</p></div>
<div class="indent1"><span class="nm">(b)</span><p><span class="cl">Answer:</span> R. Akiva (and R. Gamliel argues).</p></div>
<div class="indent2"><span class="nm">1.</span><p>The Beraisa reports an incident in which R. Akiva's Sukah blew off the boat.</p></div>
<div class="indent2"><span class="nm">2.</span><p>R. Gamliel asked R. Akiva regarding the whereabouts of his Sukah.</p></div>
<div class="indent1"><span class="nm">(c)</span><p><span class="cl">(Abaye):</span> The point of dispute between R. Akiva and R. Gamliel is only regarding a Sukah strong enough to withstand land winds but not strong enough to withstand normal sea winds.</p></div>
<div class="indent2"><span class="nm">1.</span><p>R. Akiva judges the walls as whether they are Halachically viewed as Mechitzos for a temporary dwelling, an assessment made on land.</p></div>
<div class="indent2"><span class="nm">2.</span><p>R. Gamliel looks for Mechitzos which befit a permanent structure, such as a Sukah to his view.</p></div>
<div class="subject"><span class="nm">2)</span><p>A SUKAH ON AN ANIMAL</p></div>
<div class="indent1"><span class="nm">(a)</span><p><span class="cl">Question:</span> Who is the Tana who permits such a Sukah?</p></div>
<div class="indent1"><span class="nm">(b)</span><p><span class="cl">Answer:</span> R. Meir (and R. Yehudah argues).</p></div>
<div class="indent1"><span class="nm">(c)</span><p><span class="cl">Question:</span> What is R. Yehudah's rationale?</p></div>
<div class="indent1"><span class="nm">(d)</span><p><span class="cl">Answer:</span> The Pasuk indicates that the Sukah must be a residence for seven days which this Sukah, due to the prohibition of entering it on Yom Tov, does not fulfill.</p></div>
<div class="indent1"><span class="nm">(e)</span><p><span class="cl">Question:</span> And what will R. Meir claim?</p></div>
<div class="indent1"><span class="nm">(f)</span><p><span class="cl">Answer:</span> Mid'Oraisa, this Sukah <i>is</i> valid for seven days (as the prohibition to go on the animal is mid'Rabanan)!</p></div>
<div class="subject"><span class="nm">3)</span><p>USING AN ANIMAL AS A SUKAH WALL</p></div>
<div class="indent1"><span class="nm">(a)</span><p><span class="cl">(R. Meir):</span> An Sukah is Pesulah if an animal is serving as a wall (R. Yehudah permits it).</p></div>
<div class="indent2"><span class="nm">1.</span><p><span class="cl">(R. Meir):</span> Anything alive may not serve as a Sukah wall, as a Lechi, as posts around a well nor will it receive Tum'ah as the cover on a grave.</p></div>
<div class="indent2"><span class="nm">2.</span><p><span class="cl">(R. Yosi ha'Gelili):</span> Gittin may not be written on it, as well.</p></div>
<div class="indent1"><span class="nm">(b)</span><p><span class="cl">Question:</span> What is R. Meir's rationale for prohibiting an animal's use as a Sukah wall?</p></div>
<div class="indent1"><span class="nm">(c)</span><p><span class="cl">Answer (Abaye):</span> Lest the animal die.</p></div>
<div class="indent1"><span class="nm">(d)</span><p><span class="cl">Answer (R. Zeira):</span> Lest the animal run away.</p></div>
<div class="indent1"><span class="nm">(e)</span><p>A case which would illustrate the difference between them is an untied elephant.</p></div>
<div class="indent2"><span class="nm">1.</span><p>Its death would not invalidate the Sukah since it would remain 10 Tefachim.</p></div>
<div class="indent2"><span class="nm">2.</span><p>It might well run away, however.</p></div>
<div class="indent1"><span class="nm">(f)</span><p><span class="cl">Question:</span> Surely Abaye should be concerned that the animal may run away!?</p></div>
<div class="indent1"><span class="nm">(g)</span><p><span class="cl">Answer:</span> Indeed, and an untied elephant may not be used.</p></div>
<div class="indent2"><span class="nm">1.</span><p>They argue, instead, by a tied smaller animal.</p></div>
<div class="indent2"><span class="nm">2.</span><p>We are concerned for its death (Abaye).</p></div>
<div class="indent2"><span class="nm">3.</span><p>We are not concerned lest it run away (R. Zeira).</p></div>
<div class="indent1"><span class="nm">(h)</span><p><span class="cl">Question:</span> Surely R. Zeira should be concerned lest it die!?</p></div>
<div class="indent1"><span class="nm">(i)</span><p><span class="cl">Answer:</span> We view death as improbable.</p></div>
<div class="indent1"><span class="nm">(j)</span><p><span class="cl">Question:</span> But there is open space under the animal's legs (which would invalidate the Sukah)!?</p></div>
<div class="indent1"><span class="nm">(k)</span><p><span class="cl">Answer:</span> We close up the opening with foliage.</p></div>
<div class="indent1"><span class="nm">(l)</span><p><span class="cl">Question:</span> But the animal may crouch!?</p></div>
<div class="indent1"><span class="nm">(m)</span><p><span class="cl">Answer:</span> It is tied upright with ropes from above.</p></div>
<div class="indent1"><span class="nm">(n)</span><p><span class="cl">Question:</span> Such tying should eliminate our concern for its dying, as well (it would still be a Mechitzah even if it died)!?</p></div>
<div class="indent1"><span class="nm">(o)</span><p><span class="cl">Answer:</span> If it is exactly the minimum wall when alive (seven Tefachim and a bit, with less than three Tefachim from the Sechach) its death would cause it to shrink, invalidating the Sukah.</p></div>
<div class="subject"><span class="nm">4)</span><p>VIEWING DEATH AS (IM)PROBABLE</p></div>
<div class="indent1"><span class="nm">(a)</span><p><span class="cl">Question:</span> But, unlike the above, Abaye holds that R. Meir is <i>not</i> concerned for death (and R. Yehudah <i>is</i>)!?</p></div>
<div class="indent2"><span class="nm">1.</span><p>There is a contradiction where a Mishnah allows the wife of a Kohen to eat Terumah on the assumption that her husband is alive, and a Beraisa where such a woman must refrain from eating Terumah lest her husband has died.</p></div>
<div class="indent2"><span class="nm">2.</span><p>Abaye resolves the contradiction by saying that the Mishnah is R. Meir who is not concerned about death, and the Beraisa is R. Yehudah, who is.</p></div>
<div class="indent2"><span class="nm">3.</span><p>Abaye supports this distinction by citing a Beraisa regarding the tithing of wine.</p></div>
<div class="indent3"><span class="nm">i.</span><p>R. Yehudah <i>is</i> concerned about the designated barrel breaking (and would certainly be concerned about a person dying).</p></div>
<div class="indent3"><span class="nm">ii.</span><p>R. Meir <i>is not</i> concerned about the barrel breaking (and would not be concerned about a person dying).</p></div>
<div class="indent1"><span class="nm">(b)</span><p><span class="cl">Answer:</span> We must reverse Abaye's positions of R. Meir and R. Yehudah in the above resolution, to bring his positions in line with 3.b. and c. above.</p></div>
<div class="indent2"><span class="nm">1.</span><p>R. Meir <i>is</i> concerned for death and R. Yehudah <i>is not</i>.</p></div>
<div class="indent2"><span class="nm">2.</span><p>In support of this distinction, Abaye may cite our Beraisa, wherein R. Meir forbids the use of an animal and R. Yehudah permits it.</p></div>
