<p class="bas subject"><span class="nm">1)</span>BUYING ANIMALS WITH MA'OS MA'ASER</p>
<p class="bas indent1"><span class="nm">(a)</span><span class="cl">(Beraisa):</span> We may not buy animals with coins used to redeem Ma'aser Sheni.</p>
<p class="bas indent1"><span class="nm">(b)</span>If one bought b'Shogeg (unaware that the coins are of Ma'aser), the sale is undone (he gets back his money, and the seller gets back the animal);</p>
<p class="bas indent2"><span class="nm">1.</span>If one bought b'Mezid, he must bring the animal to Yerushalayim and eat it there (like Ma'aser, i.e. in Taharah).</p>
<p class="bas indent2"><span class="nm">2.</span>Rebbi Yehudah says, this (Mezid) is when he intended to buy a Shelamim. If he intended to spend the money like Chulin (to buy a Chulin animal), whether he was Shogeg (did not know that they are Ma'os Ma'aser) or Mezid, the sale is undone.</p>
<p class="bas indent1"><span class="nm">(c)</span><span class="cl">Contradiction (Mishnah (52b) - Rebbi Yehudah):</span> If he was Mezid, she is Mekudeshes. (Kidushin is like intent to spend the money like Chulin!)</p>
<p class="bas indent1"><span class="nm">(d)</span><span class="cl">Answer #1 (R. Elazar):</span> A woman knows that Ma'os Ma'aser are not profaned through acquiring her. She intends to consume (food bought with) the money in Yerushalayim. (Therefore, there is no reason to fine.)</p>
<p class="bas indent1"><span class="nm">(e)</span><span class="cl">Objection (R. Yirmiyah):</span> One knows that Ma'os Ma'aser cannot be profaned through buying a Tamei animal, slaves or land (yet we fine)!</p>
<p class="bas indent2"><span class="nm">1.</span><span class="cl">(Mishnah):</span> One may not buy a Tamei animal, slaves or land with Ma'os Ma'aser, even in Yerushalayim;</p>
<p class="bas indent2"><span class="nm">2.</span>If he bought, he must set aside money equal to what he paid and consume it like Ma'aser. (According to R. Elazar, this should not be needed, for the seller will treat the money with Kedushas Ma'aser!)</p>
<p class="bas indent1"><span class="nm">(f)</span><span class="cl">Answer #2 (R. Yirmiyah):</span> Most people do not know that Ma'aser money cannot be profaned through acquiring a wife or a Tamei animal;</p>
<p class="bas indent2"><span class="nm">1.</span>The Mishnah (that a woman is Mekudeshes through Ma'aser money) discusses a learned woman who knows the Halachah.</p>
<p class="bas indent1"><span class="nm">(g)</span><span class="cl">Contradiction (Mishnah):</span> If he bought, he must set aside money and consume it like Ma'aser.</p>
<p class="bas indent2"><span class="nm">1.</span>We should say that the sale is undone (like in the Beraisa)!</p>
<p class="bas indent1"><span class="nm">(h)</span><span class="cl">Answer (Shmuel):</span> The case is, the seller fled.</p>
<p class="bas bbbline">56b----------------------------------------56b</p>
<p class="bas indent1"><span class="nm">(i)</span><span class="cl">Inference:</span> If the seller were around, we would fine him (i.e. undo the sale).</p>
<p class="bas indent1"><span class="nm">(j)</span><span class="cl">Question:</span> It is more reasonable to fine the buyer. Even if the seller is around, the buyer should set aside money and consume it like Ma'aser!</p>
<p class="bas indent1"><span class="nm">(k)</span><span class="cl">Answer:</span> A thief would not steal if people would not buy stolen property (the buyer deserves to be fined).</p>
<p class="bas indent1"><span class="nm">(l)</span><span class="cl">Question:</span> If the thief would not steal, people could not buy from him (we should fine the thief)!</p>
<p class="bas indent1"><span class="nm">(m)</span><span class="cl">Answer:</span> They are both at fault. We fine the one holding the stolen property.</p>
<p class="bas subject"><span class="nm">2)</span>THINGS ONE MAY NOT BENEFIT FROM</p>
<p class="bas indent1"><span class="nm">(a)</span><span class="cl">(Mishnah):</span> If one was Mekadesh a woman with any of the following, she is not Mekudeshes:</p>
<p class="bas indent2"><span class="nm">1.</span>Orlah; Kil'ei ha'Kerem (crossbreeds in a vineyard); Shor ha'Niskal (an ox sentenced to be stoned for killing someone or bestiality); Eglah Arufah (a calf beheaded to atone for a murder); birds used for Taharas Metzora (one is slaughtered, and one is sent away); the hair of a Nazir; a firstborn donkey; meat cooked with milk; Chulin that was slaughtered in the Mikdash.</p>
<p class="bas indent1"><span class="nm">(b)</span>If he sold any of these and was Mekadesh with the money, she is Mekudeshes.</p>
<p class="bas indent1"><span class="nm">(c)</span><span class="cl">(Gemara) Question:</span> What is the source that Orlah is Asur b'Hana'ah (one may not benefit from it)?</p>
<p class="bas indent1"><span class="nm">(d)</span><span class="cl">Answer (Beraisa):</span> Had the Torah said "Areilim you will not eat", this would imply that one may benefit from Orlah;</p>
<p class="bas indent2"><span class="nm">1.</span>Rather, it says "v'Areltim Orlaso" to forbid benefit from it. One may not dye with it or fuel a lamp with it.</p>
<p class="bas indent1"><span class="nm">(e)</span><span class="cl">(Mishnah):</span> Kil'ei ha'Kerem.</p>
<p class="bas indent1"><span class="nm">(f)</span><span class="cl">Question:</span> What is the source that Kil'ei ha'Kerem is Asur b'Hana'ah?</p>
<p class="bas indent1"><span class="nm">(g)</span><span class="cl">Answer #1 (Chizkiyah):</span> We read "Pen Tukdash" like 'Pen Tukad Esh (lest it be burned).'</p>
<p class="bas indent1"><span class="nm">(h)</span><span class="cl">Answer #2 (Rav Ashi):</span> The verse means 'lest it become Kodesh.'</p>
<p class="bas indent1"><span class="nm">(i)</span><span class="cl">Objection:</span> If so, if it is sold, the Isur should transfer to the money (and the Kilayim should become permitted), just like Kodesh!</p>
<p class="bas indent2"><span class="nm">1.</span>Rather, we must learn like Chizkiyah.</p>
<p class="bas subject"><span class="nm">3)</span>SHOR HA'NISKAL IS ASUR B'HANA'AH</p>
<p class="bas indent1"><span class="nm">(a)</span><span class="cl">(Mishnah):</span> Shor ha'Niskal.</p>
<p class="bas indent1"><span class="nm">(b)</span><span class="cl">Question:</span> What is the source that it is Asur b'Hana'ah?</p>
<p class="bas indent1"><span class="nm">(c)</span><span class="cl">Answer (Beraisa #1):</span> "You will stone the ox" - since it is a Neveilah, one may not eat it;</p>
<p class="bas indent2"><span class="nm">1.</span>"You will not eat its meat" forbids eating it even if it was slaughtered.</p>
<p class="bas indent2"><span class="nm">2.</span><span class="cl">Question:</span> What is the source that one may not benefit from it?</p>
<p class="bas indent2"><span class="nm">3.</span><span class="cl">Answer (Ben Zoma):</span> "The owner is Naki" - he is like one who was wiped clean of his property, and gets no benefit from them.</p>
<p class="bas indent1"><span class="nm">(d)</span><span class="cl">Question:</span> What is the source that "you will not eat its meat" applies when it was slaughtered? Perhaps when it is slaughtered, it may be eaten, and the verse discusses when it was stoned, like R. Avahu taught!</p>
<p class="bas indent2"><span class="nm">1.</span><span class="cl">(R. Avahu):</span> Whenever the Torah says "it will not be eaten" or "do not eat", this also forbids benefit, unless the Torah permits benefit, like it did regarding a Neveilah!</p>
<p class="bas indent1"><span class="nm">(e)</span><span class="cl">Answer #1:</span> R. Avahu's law applies only when "do not eat" teaches that it may not be eaten. Here, we already know that it may not be eaten, for it must be stoned (and becomes a Neveilah).</p>
<p class="bas indent2"><span class="nm">1.</span>Had the verse come to forbid benefit, it would have said "do not benefit"(since we already know it may not be eaten).</p>
<p class="bas indent1"><span class="nm">(f)</span><span class="cl">Answer #2:</span> Had it come to forbid benefit, it would have said only "it will not be eaten";</p>
<p class="bas indent2"><span class="nm">1.</span>"Its meat" is extra, to forbid eating it even if it was slaughtered (like regular meat).</p>
<p class="bas indent1"><span class="nm">(g)</span><span class="cl">Question (Mar Zutra):</span> Granted, we learn that even if it was slaughtered, it may not be eaten. Perhaps this is only if it was slaughtered with a sharp stone (which is like stoning), but the verse does not discuss if it was slaughtered with a knife!</p>
<p class="bas indent1"><span class="nm">(h)</span><span class="cl">Answer:</span> The Torah did not say that slaughter must be with a knife. (Therefore, slaughter with a stone is also considered slaughter, not stoning.)</p>
<p class="bas indent2"><span class="nm">1.</span><span class="cl">(Beraisa):</span> Anything (sharp) may be used to slaughter, e.g. a rock, glass, a reed...</p>
<p class="bas indent1"><span class="nm">(i)</span><span class="cl">Question:</span> Since "it will not be eaten" forbids eating or benefit from it, what do we learn from "the owner is clean"?</p>
<p class="bas indent1"><span class="nm">(j)</span><span class="cl">Answer:</span> This forbids benefit from the skin;</p>
<p class="bas indent2"><span class="nm">1.</span>One might have thought that "its meat will not be eaten", but one may benefit from the skin. "The owner is clean" teaches that this is not so.</p>
<p class="bas indent1"><span class="nm">(k)</span><span class="cl">Question:</span> Other Tana'im (Bava Kama 41) use "the owner is clean" to exempt the owner of a Tam (an animal not established to gore) from paying even half Kofer (ransom, if it killed a person), and the owner of even a Mu'ad (established gorer) from Demei Vlados (paying for fetuses it caused to be aborted);</p>
<p class="bas indent2"><span class="nm">1.</span>What is their source to forbid benefit from the skin?</p>
<p class="bas indent1"><span class="nm">(l)</span><span class="cl">Answer:</span> "(You will not eat) Es Besaro" includes what is secondary to the meat, i.e. the skin.</p>
<p class="bas indent2"><span class="nm">1.</span>The Tana'im of Beraisa #1 learn this from "the owner is clean." They do not expound "Es".</p>
