<p class="bas subject"><span class="nm">1)</span>FOLLOWING THE ROV (cont.)</p>
<p class="bas indent1"><span class="nm">(a)</span><span class="cl">Question (Mishnah):</span> An ox gored a cow, and a dead calf is found by the cow. We do not know whether the calf was born before the goring (and it died by itself), or after the goring (and it died due to the goring). The ox pays half-damage for the cow, and quarter-damage for the calf.</p>
<p class="bas indent2"><span class="nm">1.</span><span class="cl">Question:</span> Why don't we follow the Rov of animals? Most give birth to live calves. Since this one did not, we should assume that this was due to the goring!</p>
<p class="bas indent1"><span class="nm">(b)</span><span class="cl">Answer:</span> There, we do not follow the Rov because we do not know what happened. Perhaps the cow saw the ox coming and miscarried out of fear, or perhaps the ox gored it from the back (it never saw the ox coming), and the miscarriage was due to the goring;</p>
<p class="bas indent2"><span class="nm">1.</span>We are in doubt. In all doubtful monetary cases, we divide the disputed money (according to Sumchus).</p>
<p class="bas indent1"><span class="nm">(c)</span><span class="cl">Suggestion:</span> Tana'im argue as Rav and Shmuel argue.</p>
<p class="bas indent2"><span class="nm">1.</span><span class="cl">(Beraisa):</span> An ox was grazing, and a dead ox was found next to it. Even if it was gored or bitten, and the live ox is Mu'ad (established) to gore or bite, we do not assume that it killed it;</p>
<p class="bas indent2"><span class="nm">2.</span>R. Acha says, if a dead camel was found near a mating camel, surely the mating camel killed it.</p>
<p class="bas indent2"><span class="nm">3.</span>We are assuming that Rov and Chazakah are similar (whoever follows one, he follows also the other). The assumption that the mating camel killed the dead camel is based on Chazakah.</p>
<p class="bas indent2"><span class="nm">4.</span><span class="cl">Suggestion:</span> Rav holds like R. Acha, and Shmuel holds like Chachamim.</p>
<p class="bas indent1"><span class="nm">(d)</span><span class="cl">Rejection #1:</span> Even Chachamim can hold like Rav;</p>
<p class="bas indent2"><span class="nm">1.</span>Chachamim say only that we do not follow Chazakah. They could say that we follow a Rov.</p>
<p class="bas indent1"><span class="nm">(e)</span><span class="cl">Rejection #2:</span> Even R. Acha can hold like Shmuel;</p>
<p class="bas indent2"><span class="nm">1.</span>R. Acha says that we follow Chazakah only regarding a mating camel, for it itself is Muchzak to gore. He would not say that we follow a Rov (which applies to others, i.e. most others buy for plowing).</p>
<p class="bas indent1"><span class="nm">(f)</span><span class="cl">Question (against Rav - Mishnah):</span> If Reuven bought Shimon's fruit and planted it, and it did not grow, even flax seeds, Shimon is exempt.</p>
<p class="bas indent2"><span class="nm">1.</span><span class="cl">Question:</span> Why does it say 'even flax seeds'?</p>
<p class="bas indent2"><span class="nm">2.</span><span class="cl">Answer:</span> This teaches that that even though most people plant flax seeds, we do not follow the Rov.</p>
<p class="bas indent1"><span class="nm">(g)</span><span class="cl">Answer:</span> Tana'im argue about this.</p>
<p class="bas indent2"><span class="nm">1.</span><span class="cl">(Beraisa):</span> If Reuven bought Shimon's fruit and planted it, and it did not grow, if he bought seeds that are not eaten, Shimon is liable. If he bought flax seeds, Shimon is exempt;</p>
<p class="bas indent2"><span class="nm">2.</span>R. Yosi says, Shimon must return the value of flax seeds for planting.</p>
<p class="bas bbbline">93b----------------------------------------93b</p>
<p class="bas indent2"><span class="nm">3.</span><span class="cl">Chachamim:</span> Many people buy flax seeds for other things!</p>
<p class="bas indent1"><span class="nm">(h)</span><span class="cl">Question:</span> Which Tana'im argue about following the Rov?</p>
<p class="bas indent2"><span class="nm">1.</span><span class="cl">Suggestion:</span> R. Yosi and Chachamim who responded to him argue about this.</p>
<p class="bas indent2"><span class="nm">2.</span><span class="cl">Rejection:</span> Both follow the Rov. R. Yosi follows the Rov of seed bought, and Chachamim follow the Rov of people who buy.</p>
<p class="bas indent1"><span class="nm">(i)</span><span class="cl">Answer:</span> The first Tana (does not follow the Rov). R. Yosi or the latter Chachamim do.</p>
<p class="bas subject"><span class="nm">2)</span>COMPENSATION FOR LOSS DUE TO EXPENDITURES</p>
<p class="bas indent1"><span class="nm">(a)</span><span class="cl">(Beraisa):</span> Shimon must return the value of seeds for planting;</p>
<p class="bas indent1"><span class="nm">(b)</span>Some say, he pays also the expenditures.</p>
<p class="bas indent1"><span class="nm">(c)</span><span class="cl">Question:</span> Who is the Tana who obligates paying the expenditures?</p>
<p class="bas indent1"><span class="nm">(d)</span><span class="cl">Answer (Rav Chisda):</span> It is R. Shimon ben Gamliel.</p>
<p class="bas indent1"><span class="nm">(e)</span><span class="cl">Question:</span> From which teaching of R. Shimon ben Gamliel may we infer this?</p>
<p class="bas indent2"><span class="nm">1.</span><span class="cl">Suggestion (our Mishnah):</span> If Reuven bought Shimon's fruit and planted it, and it did not grow, even flax seeds, Shimon is exempt;</p>
<p class="bas indent2"><span class="nm">2.</span>R. Shimon ben Gamliel says, if he bought seeds that are not eaten, Shimon is liable.</p>
<p class="bas indent2"><span class="nm">3.</span><span class="cl">Question:</span> (Chachamim (the first Tana) exempt for flax seeds, which are <i>mostly</i> planted.) Chachamim agree about seeds that are <i>never</i> eaten, that Shimon is liable!</p>
<p class="bas indent3"><span class="nm">i.</span><span class="cl">Answer:</span> They argue only about how much Shimon pays. Chachamim obligate only the value of the seeds, and R. Shimon ben Gamliel obligates also the expenditures.</p>
<p class="bas indent2"><span class="nm">4.</span><span class="cl">Question:</span> There is no source to say so! We could equally say just the contrary (Chachamim obligate the expenditures, and R. Shimon obligates just for the seeds)!</p>
<p class="bas indent2"><span class="nm">5.</span><span class="cl">Answer:</span> The latter Tana always comes to add.</p>
<p class="bas indent2"><span class="nm">6.</span><span class="cl">Objection:</span> Perhaps the entire Mishnah is R. Shimon ben Gamliel, and the Mishnah is abbreviated. It means as follows. If Reuven bought Shimon's fruit and planted it, and it did not grow, even flax seeds, Shimon is exempt;</p>
<p class="bas indent2"><span class="nm">7.</span>This is like R. Shimon ben Gamliel, who says that if he bought seeds that are not eaten, Shimon is liable.</p>
<p class="bas indent1"><span class="nm">(f)</span><span class="cl">Answer (Beraisa):</span> In the following cases, one is liable for substandard work if he receives wages (but if he works for free, he is exempt):</p>
<p class="bas indent2"><span class="nm">1.</span>A grinder received wheat to grind, and he did not soak it first, and therefore he produced coarse flour;</p>
<p class="bas indent2"><span class="nm">2.</span>A baker received flour to make bread, and he made bread that crumbles;</p>
<p class="bas indent2"><span class="nm">3.</span>A butcher did an invalid Shechitah.</p>
<p class="bas indent2"><span class="nm">4.</span>R. Shimon ben Gamliel says, he must also compensate the buyer and the guests for their embarrassment.</p>
<p class="bas indent2"><span class="nm">5.</span>Similarly, R. Shimon ben Gamliel said that the custom in Yerushalayim was that if one sells food for a banquet and it spoiled, he must compensate the buyer for his and the guests' embarrassment.</p>
<p class="bas indent2"><span class="nm">6.</span>Another custom in Yerushalayim is that guests may enter to eat only as long as a cloth is spread over the doorway.</p>
<p class="bas subject"><span class="nm">3)</span>FLAWED ITEMS THAT A BUYER MUST ACCEPT</p>
<p class="bas indent1"><span class="nm">(a)</span><span class="cl">(Mishnah):</span> If Reuven sold grain to Shimon, Shimon must accept a quarter Kav of Pesoles (waste) mixed in with each Se'ah, 10 wormy figs out of every 100, 10 barrels of bad wine out of every 100, and 10 bad bottles (in Sharon) out of every 100.</p>
