<p class="bas subject"><span class="nm">1)</span>RAISING SMALL ANIMALS IN <i>ERETZ</i> <i>YISRAEL</i></p>
<p class="bas indent1"><span class="nm">(a)</span><span class="cl">(Beraisa - Talmidim) Question:</span> May one raise (small animals)?</p>
<p class="bas indent1"><span class="nm">(b)</span><span class="cl">Answer (R. Gamliel):</span> Yes.</p>
<p class="bas indent1"><span class="nm">(c)</span><span class="cl">Question:</span> The Mishnah forbids this!</p>
<p class="bas indent1"><span class="nm">(d)</span><span class="cl">Correction:</span> Rather, they asked if one may keep a small animal for 30 days before the festival;</p>
<p class="bas indent2"><span class="nm">1.</span>R. Gamliel permitted this, on condition that it does not graze with the herd (e.g. of cattle, which one may raise). Rather, he must tie it to the bed.</p>
<p class="bas indent1"><span class="nm">(e)</span><span class="cl">(Beraisa):</span> A case occurred in which a Chasid was groaning. Doctors said that to be cured he needs warm milk (straight from the animal) every morning. They brought a goat and tied it to his bed. He suckled every morning.</p>
<p class="bas indent1"><span class="nm">(f)</span>One day his friends came and saw the goat. They were outraged to see an 'armed robber' in his house, and left.</p>
<p class="bas indent1"><span class="nm">(g)</span>They could not find another thing he had done wrong. He himself, as he was dying, confessed that his only transgression was disobeying the decree. (Meiri - even though one may transgress Isurim for Piku'ach Nefesh, one should be more stringent about something forbidden by a decree because it harms others.)</p>
<p class="bas indent1"><span class="nm">(h)</span><span class="cl">R. Yishmael:</span> My father's house in Galil was destroyed because they used to graze small animals in forests and judge monetary cases alone (without a Beis Din of three).</p>
<p class="bas indent2"><span class="nm">1.</span>Even though they had forests near their houses, someone else owned a small field on the way to the forest.</p>
<p class="bas indent1"><span class="nm">(i)</span><span class="cl">(Beraisa):</span> If a shepherd repents, he need not sell his whole flock immediately. He may sell it little by little.</p>
<p class="bas indent1"><span class="nm">(j)</span>Similarly, if a convert inherited dogs and pigs, he need not sell them all immediately. He may sell them little by little.</p>
<p class="bas indent1"><span class="nm">(k)</span>Similarly, if one who vowed to buy a house and marry a woman in Eretz Yisrael, we do not force him to fulfill this immediately. He may wait until he finds a suitable house and wife.</p>
<p class="bas indent1"><span class="nm">(l)</span>A man was pressuring his mother to get married. She swore that she would not refuse anyone. She was swarmed with improper men. Chachamim ruled that she intended only for someone appropriate for her.</p>
<p class="bas subject"><span class="nm">2)</span>ANIMALS THAT ONE MAY RAISE</p>
<p class="bas indent1"><span class="nm">(a)</span><span class="cl">(Beraisa):</span> Just like we may not raise small Behemos, also we may not raise small Chayos.</p>
<p class="bas indent1"><span class="nm">(b)</span>R. Shimon ben Elazar says, we may raise Kufri (midget; some say, large hunting) dogs, cats, monkeys, and bush weasels because they clean the house from mice.</p>
<p class="bas indent1"><span class="nm">(c)</span><span class="cl">Question:</span> What is a bush weasel?</p>
<p class="bas indent1"><span class="nm">(d)</span><span class="cl">Answer (Rav Yehudah):</span> It is a rodent with thin (another version - small) thighs.</p>
<p class="bas indent1"><span class="nm">(e)</span><span class="cl">Version #1 (Rav Yehudah citing Rav):</span> In Bavel, we adopted the law of Eretz Yisrael to forbid raising small animals.</p>
<p class="bas indent1"><span class="nm">(f)</span><span class="cl">Rav Ada bar Ahavah (to Rav Huna):</span> Why do you have small animals?</p>
<p class="bas indent1"><span class="nm">(g)</span><span class="cl">Rav Huna:</span> My wife Chovah guards them from damaging.</p>
<p class="bas indent1"><span class="nm">(h)</span><span class="cl">Rav Ada bar Ahavah:</span> She should bury her son!</p>
<p class="bas indent2"><span class="nm">1.</span>As long as Rav Ada was alive, none of Rav Huna's children from Chovah survived.</p>
<p class="bas indent1"><span class="nm">(i)</span><span class="cl">Version #2 (Rav Huna):</span> After Rav came to Bavel, we adopted the law of Eretz Yisrael to forbid raising small animals. (end of Version #2)</p>
<p class="bas indent1"><span class="nm">(j)</span>Rav, Shmuel and R. Asi went to a circumcision. Some say that it was a feast in honor of the redemption of a firstborn son. Rav did not want to enter in front of Shmuel; Shmuel did not want to enter in front of R. Asi; R. Asi did not want to enter in front of Rav.</p>
<p class="bas bbbline">80b----------------------------------------80b</p>
<p class="bas indent2"><span class="nm">1.</span>They decided that Shmuel would wait outside.</p>
<p class="bas indent2"><span class="nm">2.</span><span class="cl">Question:</span> Why didn't Rav or R. Asi wait outside?</p>
<p class="bas indent2"><span class="nm">3.</span><span class="cl">Answer:</span> Really, both of them were greater than Shmuel. Rav honored Shmuel and would not enter in front of Shmuel because he regretted that he once cursed Shmuel.</p>
<p class="bas indent1"><span class="nm">(k)</span>Meanwhile, a cat came and cut off a child's hand.</p>
<p class="bas indent2"><span class="nm">1.</span><span class="cl">(Rav):</span> One may kill cats, and one may not raise them. There is no Isur to steal them, nor a Mitzvah to return a lost cat.</p>
<p class="bas indent2"><span class="nm">2.</span><span class="cl">Question:</span> If one may kill them, obviously one may not raise them!</p>
<p class="bas indent2"><span class="nm">3.</span><span class="cl">Answer:</span> One might have thought that it is permitted to kill them, but there is no Isur to raise them. Rav teaches that this is not so.</p>
<p class="bas indent1"><span class="nm">(l)</span><span class="cl">Question:</span> If there is no Isur to steal them, obviously there is no Mitzvah to return a lost cat!</p>
<p class="bas indent1"><span class="nm">(m)</span><span class="cl">Answer (Ravina):</span> There is not even a Mitzvah to return the skin (if one finds it dead).</p>
<p class="bas indent1"><span class="nm">(n)</span><span class="cl">Question (Beraisa - R. Shimon ben Elazar):</span> We may raise Kufri dogs, cats, monkeys, and bush weasels because they clean the house from mice.</p>
<p class="bas indent1"><span class="nm">(o)</span><span class="cl">Answer:</span> White cats often harm people. One may not raise them. One may raise black cats.</p>
<p class="bas indent1"><span class="nm">(p)</span><span class="cl">Question:</span> The cat in the above story was black!</p>
<p class="bas indent1"><span class="nm">(q)</span><span class="cl">Answer:</span> It was a black cat born to a white cat.</p>
<p class="bas indent1"><span class="nm">(r)</span><span class="cl">Question:</span> Ravina never settled that question!</p>
<p class="bas indent2"><span class="nm">1.</span><span class="cl">Question (Ravina):</span> May one raise a black cat born to a white cat?</p>
<p class="bas indent1"><span class="nm">(s)</span><span class="cl">Answer:</span> Ravina asked about when the cat's grandmother was black. The grandmother of the cat that cut off a child's hand was white.</p>
<p class="bas subject"><span class="nm">3)</span>TEACHINGS OF RAV PAPA'S SON</p>
<p class="bas indent1"><span class="nm">(a)</span><span class="cl">(Rav Acha bar Papa (or one of his brothers)):</span> We announce (Rashi - with Shofaros and trumpets) on Shabbos about boils, so that people will pray. A locked door is not easily opened. If one buys a house in Eretz Yisrael, the document of sale may be written on Shabbos.</p>
<p class="bas indent1"><span class="nm">(b)</span><span class="cl">Question (Beraisa):</span> For other calamities that come, such as boils, locusts, flies, wasps, mosquitoes, and invasions of snakes and scorpions, only individuals cry out in prayer.</p>
<p class="bas indent1"><span class="nm">(c)</span><span class="cl">Answer:</span> For dry boils, we announce. For moist boils, only individuals cry out.</p>
<p class="bas indent1"><span class="nm">(d)</span><span class="cl">(R. Yehoshua ben Levi):</span> The boils that Hash-m brought on the Mitzriyim were wet on the outside and dry on the inside.</p>
<p class="bas indent2"><span class="nm">1.</span>He learns from "Avabu'os Pore'ach" - they were moist (only) where they spread (on the outside).</p>
<p class="bas indent1"><span class="nm">(e)</span><span class="cl">Question:</span> Rav Acha taught that a locked door is not easily opened. To what does this refer?</p>
<p class="bas indent1"><span class="nm">(f)</span><span class="cl">Answer #1 (Mar Zutra):</span> If one was unable to get Semichah (ordination to give Halachic rulings), it will be hard to get it later.</p>
<p class="bas indent1"><span class="nm">(g)</span><span class="cl">Answer #2 (Rav Ashi):</span> If Hash-m afflicts someone, He is not quick to bestow good upon him.</p>
<p class="bas indent1"><span class="nm">(h)</span><span class="cl">Answer #3 (Rav Acha mi'Difti):</span> (If Hash-m afflicts someone,) He will never bestow good upon him.</p>
<p class="bas indent2"><span class="nm">1.</span>This is wrong. Rav Acha discussed only his own situation. (Chachamim voted to make him Rosh Yeshiva, but it never occurred.)</p>
<p class="bas indent1"><span class="nm">(i)</span><span class="cl">(Rav Acha):</span> If one buys a house in Eretz Yisrael, the document of sale may be written on Shabbos.</p>
<p class="bas indent1"><span class="nm">(j)</span><span class="cl">Objection:</span> This cannot be!</p>
<p class="bas indent1"><span class="nm">(k)</span><span class="cl">Answer:</span> It means like Rava said (elsewhere), we tell a non-Jew to write the document.</p>
<p class="bas indent2"><span class="nm">1.</span>Even though normally (mid'Rabanan) one may not ask a non-Jew to do forbidden labors, here Chachamim did not decree, to promote settling in Eretz Yisrael.</p>
<p class="bas indent1"><span class="nm">(l)</span><span class="cl">(Rav Shmuel bar Nachmani):</span> If one buys a city in Eretz Yisrael, we force him to buy paths to it from all four directions, to promote settlement of Eretz Yisrael.</p>
