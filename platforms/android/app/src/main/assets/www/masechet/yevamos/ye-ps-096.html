<div class="subject"><span class="nm">1)</span><p>THE ARGUMENT OF RAV AND SHMUEL</p></div>
<div class="indent1"><span class="nm">(a)</span><p><span class="cl">Answer #3 (Abaye):</span> Perhaps Rav and Shmuel do not argue like Rav Huna explained. Rather, they argue about Rav Hamnuna's law!</p></div>
<div class="indent2"><span class="nm">1.</span><p><span class="cl">(Rav Hamnuna):</span> If a Shomeres Yavam had Bi'as Zenus she is forbidden to her Yavam.</p></div>
<div class="indent2"><span class="nm">2.</span><p>Rav says that she is like an Eshes Ish, and Bi'as Zenus forbids her;</p></div>
<div class="indent2"><span class="nm">3.</span><p>Shmuel says that she is not like an Eshes Ish, and Bi'as Zenus does not forbid her.</p></div>
<div class="indent1"><span class="nm">(b)</span><p><span class="cl">Answer #4 (Abaye):</span> Perhaps they argue about whether or not Kidushin of a stranger takes effect on a Yevamah:</p></div>
<div class="indent2"><span class="nm">1.</span><p>Rav says that she is like an Eshes Ish, and Ein Kidushin Tofsin with her;</p></div>
<div class="indent2"><span class="nm">2.</span><p>Shmuel says she is that not like an Eshes Ish, and Kidushin takes effect on her.</p></div>
<div class="indent1"><span class="nm">(c)</span><p><span class="cl">Objection:</span> Rav and Shmuel already argued about this (92b)!</p></div>
<div class="indent1"><span class="nm">(d)</span><p><span class="cl">Answer:</span> They argued only once. Their argument here was inferred from what they said there.</p></div>
<div class="subject"><span class="nm">2)</span><p>A MAN WHO HEARD SEVERAL FALSE REPORTS</p></div>
<div class="indent1"><span class="nm">(a)</span><p><span class="cl">(Mishnah):</span> They told a man that his wife died, and he married her paternal sister. They told him that this wife died, and he married her maternal sister. They told him that this wife died, and he married her paternal sister. They told him that this wife died, and he married her maternal sister.</p></div>
<div class="indent1"><span class="nm">(b)</span><p>If all were found to be alive, he is permitted to his first, third and fifth wives, and they exempt their Tzaros (if he dies without children and one of them does Yibum or Chalitzah). He is forbidden to his second and fourth wives, and (if he dies without children) Yibum of either of them does not exempt her Tzarah;</p></div>
<div class="indent1"><span class="nm">(c)</span><p>If he had Bi'ah with the second wife after the first wife died, he is permitted to his second and fourth wives, and they exempt their Tzaros. He is forbidden to his third and fifth wives, and Yibum of either of them does not exempt her Tzarah.</p></div>
<div class="indent1"><span class="nm">(d)</span><p>A minor at least nine years old and one day forbids a Yevamah to his (adult) brothers, and they forbid a Yevamah to him (this will be explained). However, he forbids only at the beginning, and they forbid at the beginning or end.</p></div>
<div class="indent1"><span class="nm">(e)</span><p>If the nine-year old did Bi'ah, he forbids her to the brothers. If they then had Bi'ah with her, or gave a Ma'amar or Get or did Chalitzah, they forbid her to him.</p></div>
<div class="indent1"><span class="nm">(f)</span><p><span class="cl">(Gemara) Question:</span> (Why does it say <i>if</i> he had Bi'ah with the second wife after the first died?) He married all (the last four) after he heard that the first died!</p></div>
<div class="indent1"><span class="nm">(g)</span><p><span class="cl">Answer (Rav Sheshes):</span> It means, after his first wife truly died.</p></div>
<div class="subject"><span class="nm">3)</span><p>BI'AH OF A NINE-YEAR OLD</p></div>
<div class="indent1"><span class="nm">(a)</span><p><span class="cl">(Mishnah):</span> A nine-year old (forbids at the beginning, but not at the end).</p></div>
<div class="indent1"><span class="nm">(b)</span><p><span class="cl">Contradiction (Rav Zvid bar R. Oshaya's Beraisa):</span> If one gave a Ma'amar to his Yevamah, and later his nine-year old brother had Bi'ah with her, she is forbidden.</p></div>
<div class="indent1"><span class="nm">(c)</span><p><span class="cl">Answer:</span> His Bi'ah forbids even at the end. His Ma'amar forbids only at the beginning.</p></div>
<div class="indent1"><span class="nm">(d)</span><p><span class="cl">Question:</span> His Bi'ah does not forbid at the end!</p></div>
<div class="indent2"><span class="nm">1.</span><p><span class="cl">(Mishnah):</span> He forbids only at the beginning, but they forbid at the beginning or end. If the nine-year old had Bi'ah...</p></div>
<div class="indent1"><span class="nm">(e)</span><p><span class="cl">Answer:</span> The Mishnah is abbreviated; it means as follows:</p></div>
<div class="indent2"><span class="nm">1.</span><p>A nine-year old disqualifies at the beginning. Adult brothers disqualify at the beginning and the end;</p></div>
<div class="indent2"><span class="nm">2.</span><p>This applies to a Ma'amar. Bi'ah disqualifies even at the end. How is this? If a nine-year old had Bi'ah with his Yevamah he disqualifies the brothers from doing Yibum.</p></div>
<div class="indent1"><span class="nm">(f)</span><p><span class="cl">Question:</span> The Ma'amar of a nine-year old does not disqualify the brothers from doing Yibum!</p></div>
<div class="indent2"><span class="nm">1.</span><p><span class="cl">(Beraisa):</span> A nine-year old disqualifies in one way, i.e. Bi'ah. (Adult) brothers forbid to him in four ways, i.e. Bi'ah, Ma'amar, Get and Chalitzah.</p></div>
<div class="indent1"><span class="nm">(g)</span><p><span class="cl">Answer:</span> The Tana taught Bi'ah of a nine-year old because it always forbids. He did not teach about his Ma'amar, since it forbids only at the beginning.</p></div>
<div class="indent1"><span class="nm">(h)</span><p><span class="cl">(Rav Yehudah):</span> A nine-year old has (ability to forbid a Yevamah to the brothers through) a Get.</p></div>
<div class="indent1"><span class="nm">(i)</span><p><span class="cl">(Rav Tachlifa bar Avimi):</span> He has a Ma'amar.</p></div>
<div class="indent1"><span class="nm">(j)</span><p><span class="cl">(Beraisa - R. Meir):</span> He has a Get and a Ma'amar.</p></div>
<div class="indent1"><span class="nm">(k)</span><p><span class="cl">Question:</span> R. Meir does not hold that he has a Get!</p></div>
<div class="indent2"><span class="nm">1.</span><p><span class="cl">(Beraisa):</span> They made Bi'ah of a nine-year old like Ma'amar of an adult;</p></div>
<div class="indent2"><span class="nm">2.</span><p>R. Meir says, they made Chalitzah of a nine-year old like the Get of an adult.</p></div>
<div class="indent2"><span class="nm">3.</span><p>If R. Meir held that he has a Get, he should say that they made his Chalitzah like his Get!</p></div>
<div class="indent1"><span class="nm">(l)</span><p><span class="cl">Answer (Rav Huna brei d'Rav Yehoshua):</span> He has a Get, but it is weaker than the Get of an adult;</p></div>
<div class="indent2"><span class="nm">1.</span><p>R. Gamliel says that a Get does not take effect after a Get. This is only when the second is no stronger; but if an adult gave a Get after a minor did, it takes effect;</p></div>
<div class="indent2"><span class="nm">2.</span><p>Chachamim say that a Get takes effect after a Get. This is only when the second is no weaker, but if a minor gave a Get after an adult did, it is void.</p></div>
<div class="bbbline">96b----------------------------------------96b</p></div>
<div class="indent1"><span class="nm">(m)</span><p><span class="cl">(Mishnah):</span> If Levi, a nine year old, had Bi'ah with his Yevamah, and later his nine-year old brother Reuven had Bi'ah with her, this forbids her to Levi;</p></div>
<div class="indent1"><span class="nm">(n)</span><p>R. Shimon says, it does not forbid her;</p></div>
<div class="indent1"><span class="nm">(o)</span><p>If a nine-year old had Bi'ah with his Yevamah Leah, and then with her Tzarah, this forbids Leah to himself;</p></div>
<div class="indent1"><span class="nm">(p)</span><p>R. Shimon says, it does not forbid her.</p></div>
<div class="indent1"><span class="nm">(q)</span><p><span class="cl">(Gemara - Beraisa - R. Shimon to Chachamim):</span> If Levi's Bi'ah is considered Bi'ah (he acquired her), Reuven's Bi'ah has no effect! If Levi's Bi'ah is not considered Bi'ah, the same applies to Reuven (so his Bi'ah should not forbid her to Levi)!</p></div>
<div class="indent1"><span class="nm">(r)</span><p>Our Mishnah is unlike Ben Azai;</p></div>
<div class="indent2"><span class="nm">1.</span><p><span class="cl">(Beraisa - Ben Azai):</span> A Ma'amar takes effect after a Ma'amar when there are two Yevamim and one Yevamah, but not when there is one Yavam and two Yevamos. (Our Mishnah considers Bi'ah of a nine year-old like a Ma'amar, and says that there is Bi'ah after Bi'ah even when there are two Yevamos.)</p></div>
<div class="subject"><span class="nm">4)</span><p>YIBUM OF A NINE-YEAR OLD</p></div>
<div class="indent1"><span class="nm">(a)</span><p><span class="cl">(Mishnah):</span> If a nine year old had Bi'ah with his Yevamah and he died, she does Chalitzah, but not Yibum. If he married a woman, she does not fall to Yibum;</p></div>
<div class="indent1"><span class="nm">(b)</span><p>If he had Bi'ah with his Yevamah Sarah, married Leah after he became an adult, and then died:</p></div>
<div class="indent2"><span class="nm">1.</span><p>If he did not have Bi'ah with Sarah in adulthood, Sarah does Chalitzah, but not Yibum. Leah may do Chalitzah or Yibum;</p></div>
<div class="indent2"><span class="nm">2.</span><p>R. Shimon says, the Yavam may do Yibum or Chalitzah with either wife he wants, and does Chalitzah to the other.</p></div>
<div class="indent1"><span class="nm">(c)</span><p>A 20-year old who did not bring two hairs is like a nine-year old.</p></div>
<div class="indent1"><span class="nm">(d)</span><p><span class="cl">(Gemara - Rava):</span> Chachamim say that Eshes Shnei Mesim (a Yevamah who fell to Yibum from two brothers) does Chalitzah, but not Yibum. Do not say that this is only when there is a Tzarah, and they decreed lest people say that two Yevamos from one husband do Yibum. Here, there is no Tzarah, and she must do Chalitzah, but not Yibum!</p></div>
<div class="indent1"><span class="nm">(e)</span><p><span class="cl">(Mishnah):</span> If he married a woman and he died ...</p></div>
<div class="indent1"><span class="nm">(f)</span><p>Our Mishnah teaches like a Beraisa does;</p></div>
<div class="indent2"><span class="nm">1.</span><p><span class="cl">(Beraisa):</span> If a lunatic or minor married and died, his wife is exempt from Chalitzah and Yibum.</p></div>
<div class="indent1"><span class="nm">(g)</span><p><span class="cl">(Mishnah):</span> If he married after he became an adult...</p></div>
<div class="indent1"><span class="nm">(h)</span><p><span class="cl">Question:</span> The Bi'ah of a nine-year old should be like an adult's Ma'amar, and Leah should be forbidden to do Yibum (like the Tzarah of a Yevamah who received a Ma'amar - 31b)!</p></div>
<div class="indent1"><span class="nm">(i)</span><p><span class="cl">Answer #1 (Rav):</span> Chachamim did not make Bi'ah of a nine-year old like an adult's Ma'amar.</p></div>
<div class="indent1"><span class="nm">(j)</span><p><span class="cl">(Shmuel and R. Yochanan):</span> It is like a Ma'amar!</p></div>
<div class="indent1"><span class="nm">(k)</span><p><span class="cl">Question:</span> The above question is difficult for Shmuel and R. Yochanan!</p></div>
<div class="indent1"><span class="nm">(l)</span><p><span class="cl">Answer #2:</span> Tana'im argue about whether or not the Tzarah of Eshes Shnei Mesim may do Yibum.</p></div>
<div class="indent2"><span class="nm">1.</span><p>The Tana of the Mishnah (31b) decrees lest people do Yibum to both. He taught about an adult Yavam, and the same applies to a minor;</p></div>
<div class="indent2"><span class="nm">2.</span><p>Our Tana says that Bi'ah of a nine-year old is like a Ma'amar, but we do not decree lest people do Yibum also to the Tzarah. He taught about a minor, and the same applies to an adult;</p></div>
<div class="indent3"><span class="nm">i.</span><p>He taught about a minor because he was discussing minors.</p></div>
<div class="indent1"><span class="nm">(m)</span><p>R. Elazar said this teaching without attributing it to R. Yochanan. R. Yochanan was upset when he heard about this.</p></div>
<div class="indent2"><span class="nm">1.</span><p><span class="cl">R. Ami and R. Asi:</span> In the synagogue in Teverya, R. Elazar and R. Yosi argued about a bolt with a pestle at the end until they tore a Sefer Torah in their anger.</p></div>
<div class="indent3"><span class="nm">i.</span><p><span class="cl">Objection:</span> Surely, they did not tear a Sefer Torah!</p></div>
<div class="indent3"><span class="nm">ii.</span><p><span class="cl">Correction:</span> Rather, a Sefer Torah was torn in their anger.</p></div>
<div class="indent2"><span class="nm">2.</span><p>R. Yosi ben Kisma was there, and said that it would not be surprising if the Shul became a place of idolatry. It did! (This shows that it is imprudent to be angry!)</p></div>
<div class="indent2"><span class="nm">3.</span><p>R. Yochanan was even more adamant. 'Do you consider R. Elazar to be my colleague' (like the parties in your story? He is my Talmid!</p></div>
<div class="indent2"><span class="nm">4.</span><p><span class="cl">R. Yakov bar Idi:</span> "As Hash-m commanded Moshe His servant, so Moshe commanded Yehoshua, and so did Yehoshua, he did not omit one thing from everything Hash-m commanded Moshe".</p></div>
<div class="indent3"><span class="nm">i.</span><p>Did Yehoshua say about everything 'Moshe told me so'?! Rather, he expounded, and everyone knew that he learned his Torah from Moshe;</p></div>
<div class="indent3"><span class="nm">ii.</span><p>Also R. Elazar your Talmid expounds, and everyone knows that it is your teachings!</p></div>
<div class="indent2"><span class="nm">5.</span><p><span class="cl">R. Yochanan (to R. Ami and R. Asi):</span> Why don't you know how to appease like our colleague, Idi's son?!</p></div>
