<p class="bas subject"><span class="nm">1)</span>THE ARGUMENT OF RAV AND SHMUEL</p>
<p class="bas indent1"><span class="nm">(a)</span><span class="cl">Answer #3 (Abaye):</span> Perhaps Rav and Shmuel do not argue like Rav Huna explained. Rather, they argue about Rav Hamnuna's law!</p>
<p class="bas indent2"><span class="nm">1.</span><span class="cl">(Rav Hamnuna):</span> If a Shomeres Yavam had Bi'as Zenus she is forbidden to her Yavam.</p>
<p class="bas indent2"><span class="nm">2.</span>Rav says that she is like an Eshes Ish, and Bi'as Zenus forbids her;</p>
<p class="bas indent2"><span class="nm">3.</span>Shmuel says that she is not like an Eshes Ish, and Bi'as Zenus does not forbid her.</p>
<p class="bas indent1"><span class="nm">(b)</span><span class="cl">Answer #4 (Abaye):</span> Perhaps they argue about whether or not Kidushin of a stranger takes effect on a Yevamah:</p>
<p class="bas indent2"><span class="nm">1.</span>Rav says that she is like an Eshes Ish, and Ein Kidushin Tofsin with her;</p>
<p class="bas indent2"><span class="nm">2.</span>Shmuel says she is that not like an Eshes Ish, and Kidushin takes effect on her.</p>
<p class="bas indent1"><span class="nm">(c)</span><span class="cl">Objection:</span> Rav and Shmuel already argued about this (92b)!</p>
<p class="bas indent1"><span class="nm">(d)</span><span class="cl">Answer:</span> They argued only once. Their argument here was inferred from what they said there.</p>
<p class="bas subject"><span class="nm">2)</span>A MAN WHO HEARD SEVERAL FALSE REPORTS</p>
<p class="bas indent1"><span class="nm">(a)</span><span class="cl">(Mishnah):</span> They told a man that his wife died, and he married her paternal sister. They told him that this wife died, and he married her maternal sister. They told him that this wife died, and he married her paternal sister. They told him that this wife died, and he married her maternal sister.</p>
<p class="bas indent1"><span class="nm">(b)</span>If all were found to be alive, he is permitted to his first, third and fifth wives, and they exempt their Tzaros (if he dies without children and one of them does Yibum or Chalitzah). He is forbidden to his second and fourth wives, and (if he dies without children) Yibum of either of them does not exempt her Tzarah;</p>
<p class="bas indent1"><span class="nm">(c)</span>If he had Bi'ah with the second wife after the first wife died, he is permitted to his second and fourth wives, and they exempt their Tzaros. He is forbidden to his third and fifth wives, and Yibum of either of them does not exempt her Tzarah.</p>
<p class="bas indent1"><span class="nm">(d)</span>A minor at least nine years old and one day forbids a Yevamah to his (adult) brothers, and they forbid a Yevamah to him (this will be explained). However, he forbids only at the beginning, and they forbid at the beginning or end.</p>
<p class="bas indent1"><span class="nm">(e)</span>If the nine-year old did Bi'ah, he forbids her to the brothers. If they then had Bi'ah with her, or gave a Ma'amar or Get or did Chalitzah, they forbid her to him.</p>
<p class="bas indent1"><span class="nm">(f)</span><span class="cl">(Gemara) Question:</span> (Why does it say <i>if</i> he had Bi'ah with the second wife after the first died?) He married all (the last four) after he heard that the first died!</p>
<p class="bas indent1"><span class="nm">(g)</span><span class="cl">Answer (Rav Sheshes):</span> It means, after his first wife truly died.</p>
<p class="bas subject"><span class="nm">3)</span><i>BI'AH</i> OF A NINE-YEAR OLD</p>
<p class="bas indent1"><span class="nm">(a)</span><span class="cl">(Mishnah):</span> A nine-year old (forbids at the beginning, but not at the end).</p>
<p class="bas indent1"><span class="nm">(b)</span><span class="cl">Contradiction (Rav Zvid bar R. Oshaya's Beraisa):</span> If one gave a Ma'amar to his Yevamah, and later his nine-year old brother had Bi'ah with her, she is forbidden.</p>
<p class="bas indent1"><span class="nm">(c)</span><span class="cl">Answer:</span> His Bi'ah forbids even at the end. His Ma'amar forbids only at the beginning.</p>
<p class="bas indent1"><span class="nm">(d)</span><span class="cl">Question:</span> His Bi'ah does not forbid at the end!</p>
<p class="bas indent2"><span class="nm">1.</span><span class="cl">(Mishnah):</span> He forbids only at the beginning, but they forbid at the beginning or end. If the nine-year old had Bi'ah...</p>
<p class="bas indent1"><span class="nm">(e)</span><span class="cl">Answer:</span> The Mishnah is abbreviated; it means as follows:</p>
<p class="bas indent2"><span class="nm">1.</span>A nine-year old disqualifies at the beginning. Adult brothers disqualify at the beginning and the end;</p>
<p class="bas indent2"><span class="nm">2.</span>This applies to a Ma'amar. Bi'ah disqualifies even at the end. How is this? If a nine-year old had Bi'ah with his Yevamah he disqualifies the brothers from doing Yibum.</p>
<p class="bas indent1"><span class="nm">(f)</span><span class="cl">Question:</span> The Ma'amar of a nine-year old does not disqualify the brothers from doing Yibum!</p>
<p class="bas indent2"><span class="nm">1.</span><span class="cl">(Beraisa):</span> A nine-year old disqualifies in one way, i.e. Bi'ah. (Adult) brothers forbid to him in four ways, i.e. Bi'ah, Ma'amar, Get and Chalitzah.</p>
<p class="bas indent1"><span class="nm">(g)</span><span class="cl">Answer:</span> The Tana taught Bi'ah of a nine-year old because it always forbids. He did not teach about his Ma'amar, since it forbids only at the beginning.</p>
<p class="bas indent1"><span class="nm">(h)</span><span class="cl">(Rav Yehudah):</span> A nine-year old has (ability to forbid a Yevamah to the brothers through) a Get.</p>
<p class="bas indent1"><span class="nm">(i)</span><span class="cl">(Rav Tachlifa bar Avimi):</span> He has a Ma'amar.</p>
<p class="bas indent1"><span class="nm">(j)</span><span class="cl">(Beraisa - R. Meir):</span> He has a Get and a Ma'amar.</p>
<p class="bas indent1"><span class="nm">(k)</span><span class="cl">Question:</span> R. Meir does not hold that he has a Get!</p>
<p class="bas indent2"><span class="nm">1.</span><span class="cl">(Beraisa):</span> They made Bi'ah of a nine-year old like Ma'amar of an adult;</p>
<p class="bas indent2"><span class="nm">2.</span>R. Meir says, they made Chalitzah of a nine-year old like the Get of an adult.</p>
<p class="bas indent2"><span class="nm">3.</span>If R. Meir held that he has a Get, he should say that they made his Chalitzah like his Get!</p>
<p class="bas indent1"><span class="nm">(l)</span><span class="cl">Answer (Rav Huna brei d'Rav Yehoshua):</span> He has a Get, but it is weaker than the Get of an adult;</p>
<p class="bas indent2"><span class="nm">1.</span>R. Gamliel says that a Get does not take effect after a Get. This is only when the second is no stronger; but if an adult gave a Get after a minor did, it takes effect;</p>
<p class="bas indent2"><span class="nm">2.</span>Chachamim say that a Get takes effect after a Get. This is only when the second is no weaker, but if a minor gave a Get after an adult did, it is void.</p>
<p class="bas bbbline">96b----------------------------------------96b</p>
<p class="bas indent1"><span class="nm">(m)</span><span class="cl">(Mishnah):</span> If Levi, a nine year old, had Bi'ah with his Yevamah, and later his nine-year old brother Reuven had Bi'ah with her, this forbids her to Levi;</p>
<p class="bas indent1"><span class="nm">(n)</span>R. Shimon says, it does not forbid her;</p>
<p class="bas indent1"><span class="nm">(o)</span>If a nine-year old had Bi'ah with his Yevamah Leah, and then with her Tzarah, this forbids Leah to himself;</p>
<p class="bas indent1"><span class="nm">(p)</span>R. Shimon says, it does not forbid her.</p>
<p class="bas indent1"><span class="nm">(q)</span><span class="cl">(Gemara - Beraisa - R. Shimon to Chachamim):</span> If Levi's Bi'ah is considered Bi'ah (he acquired her), Reuven's Bi'ah has no effect! If Levi's Bi'ah is not considered Bi'ah, the same applies to Reuven (so his Bi'ah should not forbid her to Levi)!</p>
<p class="bas indent1"><span class="nm">(r)</span>Our Mishnah is unlike Ben Azai;</p>
<p class="bas indent2"><span class="nm">1.</span><span class="cl">(Beraisa - Ben Azai):</span> A Ma'amar takes effect after a Ma'amar when there are two Yevamim and one Yevamah, but not when there is one Yavam and two Yevamos. (Our Mishnah considers Bi'ah of a nine year-old like a Ma'amar, and says that there is Bi'ah after Bi'ah even when there are two Yevamos.)</p>
<p class="bas subject"><span class="nm">4)</span><i>YIBUM</i> OF A NINE-YEAR OLD</p>
<p class="bas indent1"><span class="nm">(a)</span><span class="cl">(Mishnah):</span> If a nine year old had Bi'ah with his Yevamah and he died, she does Chalitzah, but not Yibum. If he married a woman, she does not fall to Yibum;</p>
<p class="bas indent1"><span class="nm">(b)</span>If he had Bi'ah with his Yevamah Sarah, married Leah after he became an adult, and then died:</p>
<p class="bas indent2"><span class="nm">1.</span>If he did not have Bi'ah with Sarah in adulthood, Sarah does Chalitzah, but not Yibum. Leah may do Chalitzah or Yibum;</p>
<p class="bas indent2"><span class="nm">2.</span>R. Shimon says, the Yavam may do Yibum or Chalitzah with either wife he wants, and does Chalitzah to the other.</p>
<p class="bas indent1"><span class="nm">(c)</span>A 20-year old who did not bring two hairs is like a nine-year old.</p>
<p class="bas indent1"><span class="nm">(d)</span><span class="cl">(Gemara - Rava):</span> Chachamim say that Eshes Shnei Mesim (a Yevamah who fell to Yibum from two brothers) does Chalitzah, but not Yibum. Do not say that this is only when there is a Tzarah, and they decreed lest people say that two Yevamos from one husband do Yibum. Here, there is no Tzarah, and she must do Chalitzah, but not Yibum!</p>
<p class="bas indent1"><span class="nm">(e)</span><span class="cl">(Mishnah):</span> If he married a woman and he died ...</p>
<p class="bas indent1"><span class="nm">(f)</span>Our Mishnah teaches like a Beraisa does;</p>
<p class="bas indent2"><span class="nm">1.</span><span class="cl">(Beraisa):</span> If a lunatic or minor married and died, his wife is exempt from Chalitzah and Yibum.</p>
<p class="bas indent1"><span class="nm">(g)</span><span class="cl">(Mishnah):</span> If he married after he became an adult...</p>
<p class="bas indent1"><span class="nm">(h)</span><span class="cl">Question:</span> The Bi'ah of a nine-year old should be like an adult's Ma'amar, and Leah should be forbidden to do Yibum (like the Tzarah of a Yevamah who received a Ma'amar - 31b)!</p>
<p class="bas indent1"><span class="nm">(i)</span><span class="cl">Answer #1 (Rav):</span> Chachamim did not make Bi'ah of a nine-year old like an adult's Ma'amar.</p>
<p class="bas indent1"><span class="nm">(j)</span><span class="cl">(Shmuel and R. Yochanan):</span> It is like a Ma'amar!</p>
<p class="bas indent1"><span class="nm">(k)</span><span class="cl">Question:</span> The above question is difficult for Shmuel and R. Yochanan!</p>
<p class="bas indent1"><span class="nm">(l)</span><span class="cl">Answer #2:</span> Tana'im argue about whether or not the Tzarah of Eshes Shnei Mesim may do Yibum.</p>
<p class="bas indent2"><span class="nm">1.</span>The Tana of the Mishnah (31b) decrees lest people do Yibum to both. He taught about an adult Yavam, and the same applies to a minor;</p>
<p class="bas indent2"><span class="nm">2.</span>Our Tana says that Bi'ah of a nine-year old is like a Ma'amar, but we do not decree lest people do Yibum also to the Tzarah. He taught about a minor, and the same applies to an adult;</p>
<p class="bas indent3"><span class="nm">i.</span>He taught about a minor because he was discussing minors.</p>
<p class="bas indent1"><span class="nm">(m)</span>R. Elazar said this teaching without attributing it to R. Yochanan. R. Yochanan was upset when he heard about this.</p>
<p class="bas indent2"><span class="nm">1.</span><span class="cl">R. Ami and R. Asi:</span> In the synagogue in Teverya, R. Elazar and R. Yosi argued about a bolt with a pestle at the end until they tore a Sefer Torah in their anger.</p>
<p class="bas indent3"><span class="nm">i.</span><span class="cl">Objection:</span> Surely, they did not tear a Sefer Torah!</p>
<p class="bas indent3"><span class="nm">ii.</span><span class="cl">Correction:</span> Rather, a Sefer Torah was torn in their anger.</p>
<p class="bas indent2"><span class="nm">2.</span>R. Yosi ben Kisma was there, and said that it would not be surprising if the Shul became a place of idolatry. It did! (This shows that it is imprudent to be angry!)</p>
<p class="bas indent2"><span class="nm">3.</span>R. Yochanan was even more adamant. 'Do you consider R. Elazar to be my colleague' (like the parties in your story? He is my Talmid!</p>
<p class="bas indent2"><span class="nm">4.</span><span class="cl">R. Yakov bar Idi:</span> "As Hash-m commanded Moshe His servant, so Moshe commanded Yehoshua, and so did Yehoshua, he did not omit one thing from everything Hash-m commanded Moshe".</p>
<p class="bas indent3"><span class="nm">i.</span>Did Yehoshua say about everything 'Moshe told me so'?! Rather, he expounded, and everyone knew that he learned his Torah from Moshe;</p>
<p class="bas indent3"><span class="nm">ii.</span>Also R. Elazar your Talmid expounds, and everyone knows that it is your teachings!</p>
<p class="bas indent2"><span class="nm">5.</span><span class="cl">R. Yochanan (to R. Ami and R. Asi):</span> Why don't you know how to appease like our colleague, Idi's son?!</p>
