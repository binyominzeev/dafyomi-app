<p class="bas subject"><span class="nm">1)</span>WHY R. OSHIYA OMITTED THESE CASES</p>
<p class="bas indent1"><span class="nm">(a)</span><span class="cl">Question:</span> R. Oshiya should have listed Edim Zomemim, for they pay principal!</p>
<p class="bas indent1"><span class="nm">(b)</span><span class="cl">Answer:</span> He holds like R. Akiva, who says they do not pay if they admit (i.e. it is a fine).</p>
<p class="bas indent1"><span class="nm">(c)</span><span class="cl">Question:</span> If he holds like R. Akiva, he should list separately an ox that damages a man from an ox that damages an animal!</p>
<p class="bas indent2"><span class="nm">1.</span><span class="cl">(Mishnah - R. Akiva):</span> Even a Tam (an animal not established to gore) that damages a man pays the full damage, less what the man damaged it.</p>
<p class="bas indent1"><span class="nm">(d)</span><span class="cl">Answer:</span> R. Akiva weakened his fist (might. He says that a Tam that gores a person pays only from the animal. R. Oshiya listed only damages that are paid from Meitav.)</p>
<p class="bas indent2"><span class="nm">1.</span><span class="cl">(Beraisa - R. Akiva) Suggestion:</span> Perhaps a Tam that gores a person pays (full) damage, even if it is more than the animal is worth!</p>
<p class="bas indent2"><span class="nm">2.</span><span class="cl">Rejection:</span> "Will be done to it" - payment comes only from the animal.</p>
<p class="bas indent1"><span class="nm">(e)</span><span class="cl">Question:</span> R. Oshiya should have listed a rapist, enticer and Motzi Shem Ra, for these pay principal (in addition to a fine! Motzi Shem Ra pays only a fine. It was taught unnecessarily with the others.)</p>
<p class="bas indent1"><span class="nm">(f)</span><span class="cl">Answer:</span> They also pay Nezek, pain, and embarrassment. He taught these!</p>
<p class="bas indent2"><span class="nm">1.</span>Payment for the blemish is Nezek;</p>
<p class="bas indent2"><span class="nm">2.</span>The other only payment is a fine. R. Oshaya does not list fines!</p>
<p class="bas indent1"><span class="nm">(g)</span><span class="cl">Question:</span> R. Oshiya should have listed one who makes Tamei, one who mixes Terumah with Chulin, and one who pours libations to idolatry, for these pay principal!</p>
<p class="bas indent1"><span class="nm">(h)</span><span class="cl">Answer #1:</span> If unrecognizable damage is considered damage, this is Nezek!</p>
<p class="bas indent1"><span class="nm">(i)</span><span class="cl">Answer #2:</span> If unrecognizable damage is not considered damage, a fine mid'Rabanan obligates one to pay for these. R. Oshiya does not list fines!</p>
<p class="bas indent1"><span class="nm">(j)</span><span class="cl">Suggestion:</span> R. Chiya cannot hold that unrecognizable damage is considered damage, for if so these cases would be included in Nezek!</p>
<p class="bas indent1"><span class="nm">(k)</span><span class="cl">Rejection:</span> He can hold that it is considered damage. He lists separately recognizable and unrecognizable damage.</p>
<p class="bas subject"><span class="nm">2)</span>EXCLUDED CASES</p>
<p class="bas indent1"><span class="nm">(a)</span>The Tana of our Mishnah gave the number of Avos (four), to exclude those of R. Oshiya and R. Chiya. R. Oshiya gave the number of Avos (13), to exclude those of R. Chiya;</p>
<p class="bas indent1"><span class="nm">(b)</span><span class="cl">Question:</span> Why did R. Chiya say there are (only) 24 Avos? What does he exclude?</p>
<p class="bas indent1"><span class="nm">(c)</span><span class="cl">Answer:</span> He excludes a Moser (one who informs to the government to take someone's property) and Mefagel (one who disqualifies a Korban through improper intent during the Avodah).</p>
<p class="bas indent1"><span class="nm">(d)</span><span class="cl">Question:</span> He should have listed them!</p>
<p class="bas indent1"><span class="nm">(e)</span><span class="cl">Answer #1:</span> He did not list Mefagel, for he discusses only Chulin.</p>
<p class="bas indent1"><span class="nm">(f)</span><span class="cl">Answer #2:</span> He did not list Moser, for he damages through mere words. R. Chiya does not list such damagers.</p>
<p class="bas indent1"><span class="nm">(g)</span><span class="cl">Question:</span> He listed Motzi Shem Ra, who damages through words!</p>
<p class="bas indent1"><span class="nm">(h)</span><span class="cl">Answer:</span> Motzi Shem Ra is liable only if he also did an action (relations).</p>
<p class="bas indent1"><span class="nm">(i)</span><span class="cl">Question:</span> He listed Edim Zomemim, who damage through words alone!</p>
<p class="bas indent1"><span class="nm">(j)</span><span class="cl">Answer:</span> The Torah calls their words a Ma'aseh (action) - "like he plotted La'asos (to do)."</p>
<p class="bas indent1"><span class="nm">(k)</span><span class="cl">Question:</span> The Tana of our Mishnah mentioned Avos, because there are also Toldos;</p>
<p class="bas indent2"><span class="nm">1.</span>R. Oshiya and R. Chiya also mentioned Avos. What are the Toldos of their additions?</p>
<p class="bas indent1"><span class="nm">(l)</span><span class="cl">Answer (R. Avahu):</span> They are all called Avos because they pay from Meitav.</p>
<p class="bas indent1"><span class="nm">(m)</span><span class="cl">Question:</span> What is the source of this?</p>
<p class="bas indent1"><span class="nm">(n)</span><span class="cl">Answer:</span> (The Torah teaches about Meitav regarding a Mu'ad ox.) An extended Gezeirah Shavah teaches this about all 24. Regarding every one, it says "Tachas", "Nesinah", "Yeshalem" or "Kesef".</p>
<p class="bas subject"><span class="nm">3)</span>WHY THE TORAH WROTE ALL THE DAMAGERS</p>
<p class="bas indent1"><span class="nm">(a)</span><span class="cl">(Mishnah):</span> The Re'i of an ox is unlike that of Mav'eh...</p>
<p class="bas indent1"><span class="nm">(b)</span><span class="cl">Question:</span> Why does the Mishnah say this?</p>
<p class="bas indent1"><span class="nm">(c)</span><span class="cl">Answer (Rav Zvid):</span> The Mishnah suggested that one damager could have been learned from another. Then it shows why it could not be learned.</p>
<p class="bas indent1"><span class="nm">(d)</span><span class="cl">(Mishnah):</span> The Re'i of these two, which are alive...</p>
<p class="bas indent1"><span class="nm">(e)</span><span class="cl">Question:</span> Why does the Mishnah say this?</p>
<p class="bas indent1"><span class="nm">(f)</span><span class="cl">Answer (Rav Mesharshiya):</span> The Mishnah suggested that one damager could have been learned from two damagers. It then shows why it could not be learned.</p>
<p class="bas bbbline">5b----------------------------------------5b</p>
<p class="bas indent1"><span class="nm">(g)</span><span class="cl">(Rava):</span> A pit and any of the others could teach (through a Tzad ha'Shavah) the remaining two;</p>
<p class="bas indent2"><span class="nm">1.</span>The only exception is Keren. We could not learn it, for the sources are Mu'ad from the beginning, but Keren is not.</p>
<p class="bas indent2"><span class="nm">2.</span>According to the opinion that it is more reasonable to obligate Keren, for it has intent to damage, even Keren could be learned. (Rashi was unsure which opinion this is. Tosfos says that it is the opinion that half damage is Mamon, not a fine. The Gra holds that it is the conclusion of Rav Yehudah (4a).)</p>
<p class="bas indent1"><span class="nm">(h)</span><span class="cl">Question:</span> If so, why did the Torah write all four?</p>
<p class="bas indent1"><span class="nm">(i)</span><span class="cl">Answer:</span> The Torah teaches special laws about each of them:</p>
<p class="bas indent2"><span class="nm">1.</span>It teaches Keren to distinguish between Tam and Mu'ad;</p>
<p class="bas indent2"><span class="nm">2.</span>It teaches Shen and Regel to exempt them in Reshus ha'Rabim;</p>
<p class="bas indent2"><span class="nm">3.</span>It teaches a pit to exempt for Kelim damaged in a pit;</p>
<p class="bas indent3"><span class="nm">i.</span><span class="cl">Question:</span> R. Yehudah obligates even for Kelim. What special law of a pit does he learn?</p>
<p class="bas indent3"><span class="nm">ii.</span><span class="cl">Answer:</span> We exempt for a man damaged in a pit.</p>
<p class="bas indent2"><span class="nm">4.</span>It teaches fire to exempt for Tamun (things that were concealed).</p>
<p class="bas indent2"><span class="nm">5.</span><span class="cl">Question:</span> R. Yehudah obligates even for Tamun. What special law of fire does he learn?</p>
<p class="bas indent2"><span class="nm">6.</span><span class="cl">Answer:</span> One is liable even if a field or rock was charred.</p>
