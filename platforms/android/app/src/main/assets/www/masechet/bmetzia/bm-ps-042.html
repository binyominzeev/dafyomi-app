<p class="bas subject"><span class="nm">1)</span>THE BEST WAY TO GUARD MONEY</p>
<p class="bas indent1"><span class="nm">(a)</span><span class="cl">(Mishnah):</span> If Reuven deposited coins with Shimon, he is liable if they were lost through one of the following ways: Shimon wrapped them and cast them on his back (and carried them), or gave them to his small children (minors) to guard, or he locked in front of them improperly;</p>
<p class="bas indent2"><span class="nm">1.</span>This is because this is not the way people guard.</p>
<p class="bas indent1"><span class="nm">(b)</span>If he guarded normally, he is exempt.</p>
<p class="bas indent1"><span class="nm">(c)</span><span class="cl">(Gemara) Question:</span> The other cases we understand, but why is he liable for wrapping them and casting them on his back? What else should he have done?</p>
<p class="bas indent1"><span class="nm">(d)</span><span class="cl">Answer (Rava):</span> "V'Tzarta ha'Kesef b'Yadecha" - even if the money is wrapped, it should be in your hand.</p>
<p class="bas indent1"><span class="nm">(e)</span><span class="cl">(R. Yitzchak):</span> A person's money should always be in his hand - "v'Tzarta ha'Kesef b'Yadecha".</p>
<p class="bas indent1"><span class="nm">(f)</span><span class="cl">(R. Yitzchak):</span> One should invest a third of his money in land, a third in merchandise, and leave a third in coins.</p>
<p class="bas indent1"><span class="nm">(g)</span><span class="cl">(R. Yitzchak):</span> Blessing only comes on something hidden from view - "ha'Berachah ba'Asamecha" (an expression of Samuy, hidden).</p>
<p class="bas indent1"><span class="nm">(h)</span><span class="cl">(Tana d'Vei R. Yishmael):</span> Blessing only comes on something that cannot be seen - "ba'Asamecha" (in your storehouse, which is hidden).</p>
<p class="bas indent1"><span class="nm">(i)</span><span class="cl">(Beraisa):</span> When one who goes to measure his grain, first he should ask Hash-m to send a Berachah on it;</p>
<p class="bas indent2"><span class="nm">1.</span>While measuring, he blesses Hash-m to thank Him;</p>
<p class="bas indent2"><span class="nm">2.</span>If he requests after measuring. this is a vain prayer, for Berachah does not take effect on anything weighed, measured or counted, only on something that is not seen.</p>
<p class="bas indent1"><span class="nm">(j)</span><span class="cl">(Shmuel):</span> The only proper guarding of coins is in the ground.</p>
<p class="bas indent1"><span class="nm">(k)</span><span class="cl">(Rava):</span> Shmuel admits that if Levi receives a deposit of coins just before Shabbos, he is not obligated to bury it then;</p>
<p class="bas indent2"><span class="nm">1.</span>If he does not bury it immediately after Shabbos, this is negligence, and he is liable.</p>
<p class="bas indent2"><span class="nm">2.</span>If the depositor is a Chacham, Levi need not bury them immediately. Perhaps the Chacham needs money for the needs of Havdalah;</p>
<p class="bas indent2"><span class="nm">3.</span>Nowadays, thieves use rods to feel for where (there is a hollow under the ground suggesting that) coins may be buried there, so money should be concealed in the roof rafters;</p>
<p class="bas indent2"><span class="nm">4.</span>Nowadays, thieves break roofs, so money should be concealed between layers of a wall.</p>
<p class="bas indent1"><span class="nm">(l)</span><span class="cl">(Rava):</span> Shmuel admits that money may be hidden in a wall.</p>
<p class="bas indent2"><span class="nm">1.</span>Nowadays, thieves feel for hollows in the wall, so coins should be buried in the Tefach closest to the ground or the ceiling.</p>
<p class="bas indent1"><span class="nm">(m)</span><span class="cl">Question (Rav Acha brei d'Rav Yosef - Mishnah):</span> If the ceiling caved in and buried Chametz, it is considered Mevu'ar (eradicated);</p>
<p class="bas indent2"><span class="nm">1.</span>R. Shimon ben Gamliel says, if a dog cannot uncover it, it is Mevu'ar.</p>
<p class="bas indent2"><span class="nm">2.</span><span class="cl">(Beraisa):</span> A dog can dig up three Tefachim.</p>
<p class="bas indent2"><span class="nm">3.</span><span class="cl">Summation of question:</span> Are three Tefachim needed to guard money?</p>
<p class="bas indent1"><span class="nm">(n)</span><span class="cl">Answer (Rav Ashi):</span> Three Tefachim are needed for a dog, that is how far it can smell;</p>
<p class="bas indent2"><span class="nm">1.</span>To guard money, it suffices that it is hidden. Three Tefachim are not needed.</p>
<p class="bas indent1"><span class="nm">(o)</span><span class="cl">Question:</span> How much is needed?</p>
<p class="bas indent1"><span class="nm">(p)</span><span class="cl">Answer (Rafram of Sichra):</span> One Tefach is needed.</p>
<p class="bas indent1"><span class="nm">(q)</span>A case occurred in which Reuven deposited coins with Shimon, who put them in a shack of willow branches. They were stolen.</p>
<p class="bas indent1"><span class="nm">(r)</span><span class="cl">(Rav Yosef):</span> This is guarded from thieves, but it is negligence regarding a fire (had a fire erupted, they would have perished);</p>
<p class="bas indent2"><span class="nm">1.</span><span class="cl">Version #1:</span> When the beginning was negligence and the end was Ones, he is liable.</p>
<p class="bas indent2"><span class="nm">2.</span><span class="cl">Version #2:</span> When the beginning was negligence and the end was Ones, he is exempt.</p>
<p class="bas indent1"><span class="nm">(s)</span>The Halachah is, he is liable.</p>
<p class="bas indent1"><span class="nm">(t)</span>A case occurred in which Reuven deposited coins with Shimon; when he claimed them, Shimon forgot where he put them.</p>
<p class="bas indent2"><span class="nm">1.</span><span class="cl">Rava:</span> This is negligence. Shimon must pay.</p>
<p class="bas subject"><span class="nm">2)</span>LOSS DUE TO LACK OF KNOWLEDGE</p>
<p class="bas indent1"><span class="nm">(a)</span>A case occurred in which Reuven deposited coins with Shimon, who gave them to his mother to guard. She put them in a chest, and they were stolen.</p>
<p class="bas indent1"><span class="nm">(b)</span><span class="cl">(Rava):</span> We cannot make Shimon pay. One who deposits expects that the Shomer will entrust the deposit with (adult) members of the Shomer's family.</p>
<p class="bas bbbline">42b----------------------------------------42b</p>
<p class="bas indent2"><span class="nm">1.</span>We cannot make his mother pay. She was not told that it was another's money, so she did not know that she should bury it!</p>
<p class="bas indent2"><span class="nm">2.</span><span class="cl">Suggestion:</span> Shimon is negligent for not telling her it is another's money.</p>
<p class="bas indent2"><span class="nm">3.</span><span class="cl">Rejection:</span> All the more so, if she thinks it is her son's she will guard it well!</p>
<p class="bas indent2"><span class="nm">4.</span><span class="cl">Conclusion:</span> Shimon swears that he gave them to his mother, she swears that they were stolen from the chest, and they are exempt.</p>
<p class="bas indent1"><span class="nm">(c)</span>An overseer of orphans bought an ox for them. He gave it to a cattle herder (Levi). It did not have (Rashi - gums or) teeth. It could not eat, so it died.</p>
<p class="bas indent1"><span class="nm">(d)</span><span class="cl">(Rami bar Chama):</span> We cannot obligate the overseer. He gave it to Levi!</p>
<p class="bas indent2"><span class="nm">1.</span>We cannot obligate Levi. He put it with the other cattle and put food in front of it. He did not know it was not eating!</p>
<p class="bas indent2"><span class="nm">2.</span><span class="cl">Question:</span> Levi was being paid by the orphans. He should have checked!</p>
<p class="bas indent2"><span class="nm">3.</span><span class="cl">Answer:</span> Indeed, if the orphans stood to lose money, Levi would be liable;</p>
<p class="bas indent3"><span class="nm">i.</span>The case is, the orphans found the seller and recovered their money from him.</p>
<p class="bas indent2"><span class="nm">4.</span><span class="cl">Question:</span> If so, who was claiming to be paid?</p>
<p class="bas indent2"><span class="nm">5.</span><span class="cl">Answer:</span> The seller is upset that they did not tell him (immediately that it has no teeth, and they want to return it).</p>
<p class="bas indent2"><span class="nm">6.</span><span class="cl">Question:</span> It was his animal. He knew it was a mistaken sale!</p>
<p class="bas indent2"><span class="nm">7.</span><span class="cl">Answer:</span> The case is, the seller buys and sells animals. He did not know that it had no teeth.</p>
<p class="bas indent2"><span class="nm">8.</span><span class="cl">Conclusion:</span> The seller swears that he did not know that it had no teeth, and the herdsman pays (the seller) for the meat at a discount (two thirds of the full price, and returns the skin. Rashi - this is a compromise. Tosfos - this is what it was worth, for the seller would have had to slaughter it immediately. It would not have lived until the market day to get the full price.)</p>
<p class="bas indent1"><span class="nm">(e)</span>Reuven deposited hops with Shimon. Shimon told his servant (Levi) 'take from here (Shimon's hops) and put in my beer.' Levi took Reuven's.</p>
<p class="bas indent1"><span class="nm">(f)</span><span class="cl">(Rav Amram):</span> We cannot obligate Shimon. He told Levi to take from Shimon's own hops!</p>
<p class="bas indent2"><span class="nm">1.</span>We cannot obligate Levi. Shimon did not say not to take from the other pile!</p>
<p class="bas indent2"><span class="nm">2.</span><span class="cl">Question:</span> If Levi delayed long enough so that Shimon could tell that he went to take Reuven's, this shows that Shimon consented!</p>
<p class="bas indent2"><span class="nm">3.</span><span class="cl">Answer:</span> The case is, he did not delay so long.</p>
<p class="bas indent2"><span class="nm">4.</span><span class="cl">Question:</span> What was the loss? Shimon's hops were not taken, he will give them to Reuven!</p>
<p class="bas indent2"><span class="nm">5.</span><span class="cl">Answer #1 (Rav Sama brei d'Rava):</span> The case is, the beer soured.</p>
<p class="bas indent2"><span class="nm">6.</span><span class="cl">Answer #2 (Rav Ashi):</span> The hops had thorns mixed in, so he did not want them in his beer,</p>
<p class="bas indent3"><span class="nm">i.</span>The Halachah is, Shimon must pay Reuven the amount that his beer increased in value.</p>
