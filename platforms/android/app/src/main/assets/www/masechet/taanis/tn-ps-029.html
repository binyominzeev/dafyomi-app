<div class="subject"><span class="nm">1)</span><p>THE TRAGEDIES OF TISH'AH B'AV</p></div>
<div class="indent1"><span class="nm">(a)</span><p><span class="cl">Question:</span> How do we know that it was on Tish'ah b'Av that it was decreed upon our ancestors not to enter Eretz Yisrael?</p></div>
<div class="indent1"><span class="nm">(b)</span><p><span class="cl">Answer:</span> The Mishkan was put up on the 1st of Nisan. The cloud lifted from it on the 20th of Iyar. The people complained for three days, and they were granted quail for a month. Then, on the 22nd of Sivan, Miriam was locked up for seven days. On the 29th of Sivan, the spies were sent out, and returned after 40 days, on the ninth of Av.</p></div>
<div class="indent2"><span class="nm">1.</span><p><span class="cl">Question:</span> There are only 39 days from th 19th of Sivan until the 9th of Av?</p></div>
<div class="indent2"><span class="nm">2.</span><p><span class="cl">Answer:</span> In that year, Tamuz was a full month.</p></div>
<div class="indent2"><span class="nm">3.</span><p>On that night of the ninth of Av, the people wept. Hash-m said that since they wept for nothing, He would cause them to weep for generations.</p></div>
<div class="indent1"><span class="nm">(c)</span><p><span class="cl">Question:</span> How do we know that the First Beis ha'Mikdash was destroyed on Tish'ah b'Av?</p></div>
<div class="indent1"><span class="nm">(d)</span><p><span class="cl">Answer:</span> One Pasuk says that it happened on the seventh, another says that it happened on the tenth;</p></div>
<div class="indent2"><span class="nm">1.</span><p>The reconciliation is that they entered on the seventh, they ate and defiled it on the seventh, eighth and ninth, lit the fires at sunset on the ninth, and they burnt for a day.</p></div>
<div class="indent3"><span class="nm">i.</span><p><span class="cl">(R. Yochanan):</span> If I had lived then, I would have established the fast on the tenth, as most of the Beis ha'Mikdash burned then.</p></div>
<div class="indent3"><span class="nm">ii.</span><p>The Rabanan held that we follow the start of the punishment.</p></div>
<div class="indent1"><span class="nm">(e)</span><p><span class="cl">Question:</span> How do we know that the Second Beis ha'Mikdash was destroyed on Tish'ah b'Av?</p></div>
<div class="indent1"><span class="nm">(f)</span><p><span class="cl">Answer:</span> Good events are brought about on good days, bad events are brought about on bad days.</p></div>
<div class="indent2"><span class="nm">1.</span><p>The Churban took place on Motzai Shabbos and Motzai Shemittah.</p></div>
<div class="indent2"><span class="nm">2.</span><p>The Levi'im sang the Shir for Wednesday, which ends with a lament, and as they sang it, the Churban began.</p></div>
<div class="indent1"><span class="nm">(g)</span><p>That Beitar was captured on Tish'ah b'Av is known from a received tradition.</p></div>
<div class="indent1"><span class="nm">(h)</span><p>That Yerushalayim was razed to the ground on Tish'ah b'Av is known from a received tradition.</p></div>
<div class="subject"><span class="nm">2)</span><p>THE EVENTS OF THE CHURBAN</p></div>
<div class="indent1"><span class="nm">(a)</span><p>When Turnusrufus destroyed the Heichal, he sentenced R. Gamliel to execution.</p></div>
<div class="indent2"><span class="nm">1.</span><p>The Roman officer announced in the Beis ha'Midrash that the man with the big nose (the most important man) is wanted.</p></div>
<div class="indent2"><span class="nm">2.</span><p>R. Gamliel hid, but the Roman found him and asked him if he would bring him to Olam ha'Ba if he would save him.</p></div>
<div class="indent2"><span class="nm">3.</span><p>When R. Gamliel agreed and swore to it, the Roman threw himself off the roof.</p></div>
<div class="indent2"><span class="nm">4.</span><p>The Romans had a law that if one of the leaders died, the decrees would be revoked.</p></div>
<div class="indent2"><span class="nm">5.</span><p>A Bas Kol announced that the Roman had earned a place in Olam ha'Ba.</p></div>
<div class="indent1"><span class="nm">(b)</span><p><span class="cl">(Beraisa):</span> When the first Beis ha'Mikdash was being destroyed, the young Kohanim took the keys to the Heichal, went up to the roof and threw them to Hash-m, saying that they were no longer trusted to look after them.</p></div>
<div class="indent2"><span class="nm">1.</span><p>A type of hand descended and took the keys, and the Kohanim leapt into the flames.</p></div>
<div class="indent2"><span class="nm">2.</span><p>Yeshayahu lamented their death, and Hash-m lamented the desolation.</p></div>

<div class="subject"><span class="nm">3)</span><p>RAV'S RULES</p></div>
<div class="indent1"><span class="nm">(a)</span><p><span class="cl">(R. Yehudah son of R. Shmuel bar Shilas citing Rav):</span> Just as we decrease pleasure when Av begins, we increase pleasure when Adar begins.</p></div>
<div class="indent2"><span class="nm">1.</span><p><span class="cl">(R. Papa):</span> Therefore, if a Jew has a court case with a non-Jew, he should not conduct it in Av, when there is bad Mazal, but rather in Adar.</p></div>
<div class="indent1"><span class="nm">(b)</span><p>The Pasuk about hopes for the exile in Bavel refers to the date-palms and linen garments there.</p></div>
<div class="indent1"><span class="nm">(c)</span><p>When Yitzchak referred to the smell of Ya'akov as being like that of a field which Hash-m has blessed, he was referring to an apple-field.</p></div>
<div class="subject"><span class="nm">4)</span><p>WASHING CLOTHES DURING THE WEEK OF TISH'AH B'AV</p></div>
<div class="indent1"><span class="nm">(a)</span><p>The Mishnah said that during the week in which Tish'ah b'Av falls, it is forbidden to have haircuts or wash clothing.</p></div>
<div class="indent2"><span class="nm">1.</span><p><span class="cl">(R. Nachman):</span> Only washing clothes to wear is forbidden, but not washing clothes for after Tish'ah b'Av.</p></div>
<div class="indent2"><span class="nm">2.</span><p><span class="cl">(R. Sheshes):</span> Even washing clothes for afterwards is forbidden.</p></div>
<div class="indent3"><span class="nm">i.</span><p>Proof of this is that the laundries of Bei Rav would shut down in this period.</p></div>
<div class="indent1"><span class="nm">(b)</span><p><span class="cl">Question:</span> The Mishnah appears to contradict R. Nachman:</p></div>
<div class="indent2"><span class="nm">1.</span><p>The Mishnah said that it is permitted to wash clothes on Thursday out of respect for Shabbos;</p></div>
<div class="indent2"><span class="nm">2.</span><p>This cannot refer to washing them in order to wear them on Thursday.</p></div>
<div class="indent2"><span class="nm">3.</span><p>So it must refer to washing them to wear afterwards on Shabbos, which is only permitted on Thursday for Shabbos, but not on other days for after Tish'ah b'Av!?</p></div>
<div class="indent1"><span class="nm">(c)</span><p><span class="cl">Answer:</span> It is referring to washing it in order to wear it immediately, in a case where he only has one shirt, so this is his last chance to do so before Shabbos.</p></div>
<div class="indent2"><span class="nm">1.</span><p>We find that someone who only has one shirt may wash it on Chol ha'Mo'ed.</p></div>
<div class="indent1"><span class="nm">(d)</span><p><span class="cl">(R. Binyomin citing R. Elazar):</span> Only washing clothes to wear is forbidden, but not washing clothes for after Tish'ah b'Av.</p></div>
<div class="indent1"><span class="nm">(e)</span><p><span class="cl">Question:</span> A Beraisa states that it is forbidden to wash clothes before Tish'ah b'Av even for after Tish'ah b'Av.</p></div>
<div class="indent2"><span class="nm">1.</span><p>The ironing of bavel is like the washing of those days.</p></div>
<div class="indent2"><span class="nm">2.</span><p>Linen clothing may be ironed.</p></div>
<div class="indent2"><span class="nm">3.</span><p>This refutes R. Elazar's view.</p></div>
<div class="indent1"><span class="nm">(f)</span><p>Although linen clothing may be ironed, it may not be worn during the week when Tish'ah b'Av falls.</p></div>
<div class="indent2"><span class="nm">1.</span><p><span class="cl">(Rav):</span> This only refers to the days until Tish'ah b'Av.</p></div>
<div class="indent2"><span class="nm">2.</span><p><span class="cl">(Shmuel):</span> It refers to the entire week.</p></div>
<div class="indent1"><span class="nm">(g)</span><p><span class="cl">Question:</span> We see that it only refers to the days until Tish'ah b'Av:</p></div>
<div class="indent2"><span class="nm">1.</span><p><span class="cl">(Beraisa):</span> During the week in which Tish'ah b'Av falls, it is forbidden to have haircuts or wash clothing, except on Thursday out of respect for Shabbos.</p></div>
<div class="indent3"><span class="nm">i.</span><p>This means that if Tish'ah b'Av fell on Sunday, it is permitted to wash all week.</p></div>
<div class="indent3"><span class="nm">ii.</span><p>If it fell from Monday to Thursday, it is forbidden to wash before but permitted after.</p></div>
<div class="indent3"><span class="nm">iii.</span><p>If it fell on Friday, it is permitted to wash on Thursday out of respect for Shabbos.</p></div>
<div class="indent2"><span class="nm">2.</span><p>If one did not wash clothing on Thursday, one may do so on Friday afternoon after Minchah.</p></div>
<div class="indent3"><span class="nm">i.</span><p><span class="cl">Abaye (or Rav Acha bar Ya'akov):</span> cursed anyone who did so.</p></div>
<div class="indent2"><span class="nm">3.</span><p>If it fell on Monday or Thursday, three people are called to the Torah, one for Maftir.</p></div>
<div class="indent2"><span class="nm">4.</span><p>If it fell on Tuesday or Wednesday, one person is called up to the Torah and for Maftir.</p></div>
<div class="indent2"><span class="nm">5.</span><p><span class="cl">(R. Yosi):</span> In all cases, three are called up.</p></div>
<div class="indent1"><span class="nm">(h)</span><p><span class="cl">Answer:</span> It is a Machlokes between Tannaim, with Shmuel holding like R. Shimon b. Gamliel:</p></div>
<div class="indent2"><span class="nm">1.</span><p><span class="cl">(Beraisa):</span> If Tish'ah b'Av or Erev Tish'ah b'Av fell on Shabbos, one may eat and drink freely like the feast of Shlomo.</p></div>
<div class="indent2"><span class="nm">2.</span><p><span class="cl">(R. Meir):</span> One may not have haircuts or wash clothes from Rosh Chodesh until Tish'ah b'Av.</p></div>
<div class="indent2"><span class="nm">3.</span><p><span class="cl">(R. Yehudah):</span> These are prohibited for the entire month of Av.</p></div>
<div class="indent2"><span class="nm">4.</span><p><span class="cl">(R. Shimon b. Gamliel):</span> They are prohibited for the entire week of Tish'ah b'Av.</p></div>
<div class="indent2"><span class="nm">5.</span><p><span class="cl">(R. Yochanan ):</span> All these opinions are based on a Pasuk speaking of rejoicing being banned for a festival (Rosh Chodesh), month, and a week.</p></div>
<div class="indent1"><span class="nm">(i)</span><p><span class="cl">(Rava):</span> The Halachah follows R. Shimon b. Gamliel.</p></div>
<div class="indent1"><span class="nm">(j)</span><p><span class="cl">(Rava):</span> The Halachah follows R. Meir.</p></div>
<div class="indent2"><span class="nm">1.</span><p>These are meant leniently;</p></div>
<div class="indent2"><span class="nm">2.</span><p>Like R. Shimon b. Gamliel in that it is only for the week of Tish'ah b'Av, not from Rosh Chodesh;</p></div>
<div class="indent2"><span class="nm">3.</span><p>Like R. Meir in that they are only forbidden until Tish'ah b'Av, not after.</p></div>
