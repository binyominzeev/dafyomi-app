<p class="bas subject"><span class="nm">1)</span>WHEN DOES <i>PIGUL</i> TAKE EFFECT?</p>
<p class="bas indent1"><span class="nm">(a)</span><span class="cl">Question:</span> Ula said 'if it causes something else (the rest of the Minchah) to become Pigul, all the more so it itself is Pigul!' (The Gemara in Zevachim explains that if Pigul was not uprooted from the Kometz, it could not cause the Shirayim (remainder) to become Pigul!)</p>
<p class="bas indent1"><span class="nm">(b)</span><span class="cl">Answer:</span> He means that an Isur that can lead to Pigul (was uprooted). (The questioner thought that if it were only an Isur that can lead to Pigul, even if were not uprooted, it could make the Shirayim Pigul. The Tartzan teaches that this is not so.)</p>
<p class="bas indent1"><span class="nm">(c)</span><span class="cl">(Mishnah - R. Yehudah):</span> The general rule is, if intent Chutz li'Zemano came first, it is Pigul, and there is Kares. If intent Chutz li'Mekomo came first, it is Pasul, and there is no Kares. Chachamim say, in either case it is Pasul, and there is no Kares.)</p>
<p class="bas indent1"><span class="nm">(d)</span><span class="cl">Question (Ravina):</span> Ilfa taught that Chachamim and R. Yehudah argue about intentions in two different Avodos. E.g. one Siman (the Kaneh (windpipe) or Veshet (foodpipe)) was slaughtered with intent Chutz li'Zemano, the second Siman with intent Chutz li'Mekomo. ('Shechitah' includes from the beginning to the the end, therefore cutting the two Simanim is like two Avodos.) However, if he had both intents in one Avodah, all agree that this is "mixed intents" (and it is Pasul, without Kares. This shows that all agree that if there was intent Chutz li'Zemano in Shechitah, and no improper intent in a later Avodah, it is Pigul!)</p>
<p class="bas indent1"><span class="nm">(e)</span><span class="cl">Answer (Rav Ashi):</span> Pigul is not established until Zerikah. (When the intents make Pigul,) it takes effect retroactively from the time of the Pigul intentions during Shechitah.</p>
<p class="bas indent1"><span class="nm">(f)</span><span class="cl">Question:</span> If so, Zerikah with intent of Pigul should also be Mekadesh the Lachmei Todah retroactively (Rashi - regarding Me'ilah; Tosfos - regarding Pigul, and likewise regarding Me'ilah of Eimurei Kodshim Kalim)!</p>
<p class="bas indent1"><span class="nm">(g)</span><span class="cl">Answer:</span> The Beraisa says that the Lechem is Kadosh. This does not mean that it is Kadosh regarding Me'ilah. Rather, the bread is Mekudash only to (be able to) become Pasul (through Linah, Yotzei or a Mechusar Kipurim - Tosfos) to require burning it.</p>
<p class="bas subject"><span class="nm">2)</span>SUPPORTS FOR RAV GIDAL</p>
<p class="bas indent1"><span class="nm">(a)</span><span class="cl">Support (for Rav Gidal - Beraisa):</span> Me'ilah always applies to Pigul (of Kodshei Kodoshim).</p>
<p class="bas indent2"><span class="nm">1.</span><span class="cl">Suggestion:</span> This is even after Zerikah (Rashi - with intent Chutz li'Zemano). This supports Rav Gidal!</p>
<p class="bas indent1"><span class="nm">(b)</span><span class="cl">Rejection #1:</span> No, it is before Zerikah.</p>
<p class="bas indent1"><span class="nm">(c)</span><span class="cl">Objection:</span> If so, there is no need to say this (Tosfos - "always"; Shitah - the same applies to a valid Korban, and not only Pigul)!</p>
<p class="bas indent1"><span class="nm">(d)</span><span class="cl">Rejection #2:</span> Indeed, it is after Zerikah, but it applies to an Olah (but Zerikas Pigul would remove Me'ilah from Korbanos that are eaten).</p>
<p class="bas indent1"><span class="nm">(e)</span><span class="cl">Objection #1:</span> This is obvious. Me'ilah always applies to an Olah after Zerikah (for Kohanim may not eat it, even if it is not Pigul)!</p>
<p class="bas bbbline">4b----------------------------------------4b</p>
<p class="bas indent1"><span class="nm">(f)</span><span class="cl">Objection #2 (Seifa):</span> If the blood was left overnight, even if Zerikah was done later, Me'ilah applies.</p>
<p class="bas indent2"><span class="nm">1.</span>We understand this if the Beraisa discusses Chatas, but this is no Chidush regarding Olah!</p>
<p class="bas indent1"><span class="nm">(g)</span><span class="cl">Question:</span> Surely, the Seifa discusses a Chatas and supports Rav Gidal (Zerikas Pigul is like Zerikah of Nosar (Kodshim after the permitted time), which does not remove Me'ilah). May we infer that also the Reisha (discusses a Chatas and) supports him? (Perush Kadmon (B) - above we said that the Reisha cannot discuss an Olah, for there would be no Chidush. We retract. Perhaps the Reisha is due to the Seifa.)</p>
<p class="bas indent1"><span class="nm">(h)</span><span class="cl">Rejection of premise:</span> Even the Seifa is not a clear support! (We cannot learn Zerikas Pigul from Zerikas Nosar)!</p>
<p class="bas indent1"><span class="nm">(i)</span><span class="cl">Question:</span> What is the difference (between them)?</p>
<p class="bas indent1"><span class="nm">(j)</span><span class="cl">Answer:</span> Nosar came about through leaving the blood overnight. This is considered an action, therefore Zerikas Nosar does not remove Me'ilah;</p>
<p class="bas indent2"><span class="nm">1.</span>Pigul came about through intent. This is not considered an action, so Zerikas Pigul can remove Me'ilah.</p>
<p class="bas indent1"><span class="nm">(k)</span><span class="cl">Support (for Rav Gidal - Beraisa):</span> Me'ilah applies to Pigul of Kodshei Kodashim.</p>
<p class="bas indent2"><span class="nm">1.</span><span class="cl">Suggestion:</span> This is even after Zerikah. This supports Rav Gidal!</p>
<p class="bas indent1"><span class="nm">(l)</span><span class="cl">Rejection:</span> No, it is before Zerikah.</p>
<p class="bas indent1"><span class="nm">(m)</span><span class="cl">Objection:</span> To reject the support, you must say that Me'ilah does not apply after Zerikah;</p>
<p class="bas indent2"><span class="nm">1.</span>If so, why does the Seifa say that Me'ilah does not apply to (Pigul of) Kodshim Kalim? The Beraisa should distinguish within Kodshei Kodashim themselves! Me'ilah applies before Zerikah, but not afterwards!</p>
<p class="bas indent1"><span class="nm">(n)</span><span class="cl">Observation:</span> The Seifa clearly supports him. (It must be even after Zerikah. There is no Chidush before Zerikah.)</p>
<p class="bas indent1"><span class="nm">(o)</span><span class="cl">Suggestion:</span> Since the Seifa supports him, also the Reisha (is even after Zerikah)!</p>
<p class="bas indent1"><span class="nm">(p)</span><span class="cl">Rejection:</span> No. The Tana prefers to teach about Kodshim Kalim, for that law is Pesika (uniform), than to teach the distinction in Kodshei Kodashim, which is not Pesika.</p>
<p class="bas subject"><span class="nm">3)</span>SHE'AS HETER REMOVES ME'ILAH</p>
<p class="bas indent1"><span class="nm">(a)</span><span class="cl">(Mishnah - R. Yehoshua):</span> The general rule is, Me'ilah applies only to things that never had She'as Heter to Kohanim;</p>
<p class="bas indent2"><span class="nm">1.</span>The following had She'as Heter -- it was left overnight, became Tamei, or was Yotzei.</p>
<p class="bas indent2"><span class="nm">2.</span>The following never had She'as Heter -- it was slaughtered with intent Chutz li'Zemano or Chutz li'Mekomo, or Pesulim did Kabalah and they did Zerikah.</p>
