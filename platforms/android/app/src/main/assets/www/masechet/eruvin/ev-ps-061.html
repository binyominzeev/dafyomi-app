<div class="subject"><span class="nm">1)</span><p>MAY ONE CROSS THE RESHUS IN WHICH THE 2000 AMOS END?</p></div>
<div class="indent1"><span class="nm">(a)</span><p><span class="cl">Defense (Rava):</span> Both of these are learned from a Mishnah!</p></div>
<div class="indent2"><span class="nm">1.</span><p><span class="cl">(Mishnah):</span> [If a big city and a small city are less than 2000 Amos apart,] people of the big city may traverse all of the small city [without deducting from their 2000 Amos,] but people of the small city may not traverse all of the big city.</p></div>
<div class="indent2"><span class="nm">2.</span><p><span class="cl">Question:</span> What is the reason?</p></div>
<div class="indent2"><span class="nm">3.</span><p><span class="cl">Answer:</span> The 2000 Amos of someone in the big city extend past the small city, but the 2000 Amos of someone in the small city end in the middle of the big city.</p></div>
<div class="indent1"><span class="nm">(b)</span><p>R. Idi questioned the law, for his text in the Mishnah said in both cases that people of' one city traverse all of the other city;</p></div>
<div class="indent2"><span class="nm">1.</span><p>He established it to discuss one who placed an Eruv in the other city. The Mishnah does not discuss one who measures 2000 Amos outside his city [through counting 2000 steps].</p></div>
<div class="indent1"><span class="nm">(c)</span><p><span class="cl">Question:</span> The Seifa discusses this!</p></div>
<div class="indent2"><span class="nm">1.</span><p><span class="cl">(Mishnah):</span> We learned that one who measures his Techum gets 2000 Amos. This is even if they end at a cave [he may not enter it].</p></div>
<div class="indent1"><span class="nm">(d)</span><p><span class="cl">Answer:</span> The Mishnah does not discuss one whose 2000 Amos end at the end of a city.</p></div>
<div class="indent1"><span class="nm">(e)</span><p><span class="cl">(Rav Nachman):</span> Both texts of the Mishnah are reasonable:</p></div>
<div class="indent2"><span class="nm">1.</span><p>The opinion that the text permits in both cases says that the Mishnah discusses one who placed an Eruv in the other city;</p></div>
<div class="indent2"><span class="nm">2.</span><p>The opinion that the text does not permit people of the small city to traverse all of the big city says that the Mishnah discusses one who measures. It is abbreviated. It means as follows;</p></div>
<div class="indent3"><span class="nm">i.</span><p>People of the big city may traverse all of the small city, but people of the small city may not traverse all of the big city.</p></div>
<div class="indent3"><span class="nm">ii.</span><p>This refers to one who measures. However, if someone in either city placed an Eruv in the other city, he may traverse all of it and 2000 Amos outside of it.</p></div>
<div class="subject"><span class="nm">2)</span><p>A CITY NEXT TO A RIVER</p></div>
<div class="indent1"><span class="nm">(a)</span><p><span class="cl">(Rav Yosef citing Rav Huna):</span> If a city is at the edge of a river:</p></div>
<div class="indent2"><span class="nm">1.</span><p>If there is a Dakah that is Arba'ah (four; the masculine form connotes Tefachim) along the border between it and the river, we measure 2000 Amos from the edge of the river. If not, everyone measures from the opening of his house. (Since people are afraid to get close to it, it is not so settled, so the law of hut dwellers applies.)</p></div>
<div class="indent1"><span class="nm">(b)</span><p><span class="cl">Abaye:</span> You taught us that the Dakah must be four Amos!</p></div>
<div class="indent1"><span class="nm">(c)</span><p><span class="cl">Question:</span> Why is this different from all other Dakos? Their Shi'ur is four Tefachim!</p></div>
<div class="indent1"><span class="nm">(d)</span><p><span class="cl">Answer:</span> Here, one is afraid [lest he fall into the river]. Normally, one is not afraid.</p></div>
<div class="indent1"><span class="nm">(e)</span><p><span class="cl">Support (Rav Yosef, for himself - Beraisa):</span> Rebbi permitted people of Geder (a city) to descend to Chamsan [on Shabbos], but not vice-versa.</p></div>
<div class="indent2"><span class="nm">1.</span><p><span class="cl">Suggestion:</span> [This is because they were on opposite sides of a river, and] there was a wall between Geder and the river, but not between Chamsan and the river!</p></div>
<div class="indent1"><span class="nm">(f)</span><p><span class="cl">Rejection #1 (Rav Dimi):</span> No. People of Geder used to hide in ambush to kill people of Chamsan. Rebbi did not permit Bnei Geder to descend to Chamsan. Rather, he enacted [that Bnei Chamsan not descend to Geder].</p></div>
<div class="indent1"><span class="nm">(g)</span><p><span class="cl">Question:</span> Why was the enactment only for Shabbos?</p></div>
<div class="indent1"><span class="nm">(h)</span><p><span class="cl">Answer:</span> People often get drunk on Shabbos.</p></div>
<div class="indent1"><span class="nm">(i)</span><p><span class="cl">Question:</span> Bnei Geder could kill Bnei Chamsan when they go there!</p></div>
<div class="indent1"><span class="nm">(j)</span><p><span class="cl">Answer:</span> [They are timid there.] A dog outside its city will not bark for seven years.</p></div>
<div class="indent1"><span class="nm">(k)</span><p><span class="cl">Question:</span> If so, perhaps Bnei Chamsan will kill Bnei Geder [to take vengeance]!</p></div>
<div class="indent1"><span class="nm">(l)</span><p><span class="cl">Answer:</span> They are not so timid there.</p></div>
<div class="indent1"><span class="nm">(m)</span><p><span class="cl">Version #1 (Rav Kahana) Rejection #2 (Rav Safra):</span> No. Chamsan was shaped like a bow. (The ends were more than 4000 Amos apart, so we measure from the bow. Geder was in the direction of the Yeser. Chamsan was within the Techum of Geder, but not vice-versa.)</p></div>
<div class="indent1"><span class="nm">(n)</span><p><span class="cl">Rejection #3 (Rav Dimi bar Chinena):</span> Geder was a big city and Chamsan was a small city. (The coming Mishnah permits people of the big city to traverse all of the small city, but not vice-versa.)</p></div>
<div class="indent1"><span class="nm">(o)</span><p><span class="cl">Version #2:</span> Rav Tivyomi taught these rejections in the name of Rav Safra and Rav Dimi, but he was unsure who said which.</p></div>
<div class="subject"><span class="nm">3)</span><p>CAN ONE CROSS THE RESHUS IN WHICH HIS 2000 AMOS END?</p></div>
<div class="indent1"><span class="nm">(a)</span><p><span class="cl">(Mishnah):</span> People of the big city may traverse all of the small city. People of the small city may (the text of some Amora'im says 'not') traverse all of the big city.</p></div>
<div class="indent1"><span class="nm">(b)</span><p>If someone in the big city placed an Eruv in the small city, or vice-versa, he may traverse all of it and 2000 Amos outside of it;</p></div>
<div class="indent1"><span class="nm">(c)</span><p>R. Akiva says, he has only 2000 Amos from his Eruv.</p></div>
<div class="indent2"><span class="nm">1.</span><p><span class="cl">R. Akiva:</span> Don't you agree that one who was Me'arev in a cave has only 2000 Amos from the Eruv?!</p></div>
<div class="indent2"><span class="nm">2.</span><p><span class="cl">Chachamim:</span> This is only if no one dwells in the cave. If people dwell there, he may traverse all of it and 2000 Amos outside.</p></div>
<div class="indent1"><span class="nm">(d)</span><p>The law of a cave is more lenient than on top of it. (No one dwells on top, so one has only 2000 Amos from the Eruv.)</p></div>
<div class="indent1"><span class="nm">(e)</span><p>We learned that one who measures his Techum gets 2000 Amos. Even if they end at a cave, he may not enter it. (The 2000 Amos were in addition to his four Amos, so we do not give him any more.)</p></div>
<div class="bbbline">61b----------------------------------------61b</p></div>
<div class="indent1"><span class="nm">(f)</span><p><span class="cl">(Gemara - Rav Yehudah):</span> If one was Shoves in a desolate city (the walls are intact, but no one dwells there), he may traverse all of it and 2000 Amos outside.</p></div>
<div class="indent1"><span class="nm">(g)</span><p>If one placed an Eruv in a desolate city, he has only 2000 Amos from the Eruv.</p></div>
<div class="indent1"><span class="nm">(h)</span><p><span class="cl">(R. Elazar):</span> In either case, he may traverse all of it and 2000 Amos outside.</p></div>
<div class="indent1"><span class="nm">(i)</span><p><span class="cl">Question (Mishnah - R. Akiva):</span> Don't you agree that one who was Me'arev in a cave has only 2000 Amos from the Eruv?!</p></div>
<div class="indent2"><span class="nm">1.</span><p><span class="cl">Chachamim:</span> This is only if no one dwells in the cave...</p></div>

<div class="indent1"><span class="nm">(j)</span><p><span class="cl">Answer:</span> 'If no one dwells there' means that it is not proper to dwell there.</p></div>
<div class="indent1"><span class="nm">(k)</span><p><span class="cl">Question (Beraisa):</span> If one was Shoves in a city, even if it is as big as Antiyuchya, or in a cave, even if it is as big as Tzidkiyahu's cave (from which he left Yerushalayim), he may traverse all of it and 2000 Amos outside.</p></div>
<div class="indent2"><span class="nm">1.</span><p><span class="cl">Inferences:</span> It teaches about a city and a cave. Surely, just like the cave is desolate, also the city;</p></div>
<div class="indent2"><span class="nm">2.</span><p>It teaches about one who was Shoves, but not if he placed an Eruv. (Then, he gets only 2000 Amos.)</p></div>
<div class="indent2"><span class="nm">3.</span><p><span class="cl">Question:</span> Who is the Tana of the Beraisa?</p></div>
<div class="indent3"><span class="nm">i.</span><p>It is not R. Akiva. He holds that whether or not a city is desolate, one who places an Eruv has only 2000 Amos!</p></div>
<div class="indent2"><span class="nm">4.</span><p><span class="cl">Answer:</span> It is Chachamim, and it allows 2000 outside the city only if he was Shoves, but not if he placed an Eruv!</p></div>
<div class="indent1"><span class="nm">(l)</span><p><span class="cl">Answer:</span> No, it teaches about a cave that is like a city. It is inhabited. It is like R. Akiva, who says that he has only 2000 Amos;</p></div>
<div class="indent2"><span class="nm">1.</span><p>He agrees about one who is Shoves. (He gets 2000 Amos outside the city.)</p></div>
<div class="indent1"><span class="nm">(m)</span><p><span class="cl">Question:</span> The Beraisa discusses Tzidkiyahu's cave [which was desolate]!</p></div>

<div class="indent1"><span class="nm">(a)</span><p><span class="cl">(Mishnah):</span> If a Yisrael lives in a Chatzer with a Nochri (i.e. their houses open to the same Chatzer), or with one who does not acknowledge [the enactment of] Eruv (i.e. a Kusi), the Nochri [or Kusi] forbids the Yisrael [to transfer between his house and the Chatzer, unless he rents the Nochri's Reshus for Shabbos];</p></div>

<div class="indent1"><span class="nm">(c)</span><p>R. Gamliel says, a case occurred in which a Tzeduki lived with us in a Mavoy in Yerushalayim. (Tzedukim do not heed Divrei Chachamim.)
