<div class="subject"><span class="nm">1)</span><p>THE SOURCES FOR PERMITING FISH WITHOUT SIMANIM</p></div>
<div class="indent1"><span class="nm">(a)</span><p><span class="cl">Answer (Ravina):</span> Chachamim of Eretz Yisrael teach that we may insert a Prat between two Kelalim that are written together to make a Klal u'Frat u'Chlal;</p></div>
<div class="indent2"><span class="nm">1.</span><p>"In water" is a Klal. "In seas and rivers" is a Prat. The second "in water" is another Klal. The Klal Prat u'Chlal teaches what is similar to the Prat, i.e. all flowing water;</p></div>
<div class="indent3"><span class="nm">i.</span><p>This includes Charitzin u'Ne'itzin, to forbid (fish in them without Simanim);</p></div>
<div class="indent3"><span class="nm">ii.</span><p>We exclude pits and caves, to permit (fish in them without Simanim).</p></div>
<div class="indent1"><span class="nm">(b)</span><p><span class="cl">Question:</span> Perhaps just like the Peratim are bodies of water in the ground (but not in Kelim), we include all such cases, i.e. (Charitzin u'Ne'itzin, and even) pits and caves. In them, fish without Simanim are forbidden!</p></div>
<div class="indent2"><span class="nm">1.</span><p>We would exclude Kelim. (In them, fish without Simanim are permitted.)</p></div>
<div class="indent1"><span class="nm">(c)</span><p><span class="cl">Answer:</span> If so, the repetition "you may eat" would not teach anything.</p></div>
<div class="indent1"><span class="nm">(d)</span><p><span class="cl">Answer #2 (to Question 3:f, 66b - Tana d'Vei R. Yishmael):</span> We do not expound "in water...  in water" according to Klal u'Frat, rather, like Ribuy and Mi'ut (inclusions and exclusions);</p></div>
<div class="indent2"><span class="nm">1.</span><p>"In water" is a Ribuy. "In seas and rivers" is a Mi'ut. "In water" is another Ribuy;</p></div>
<div class="indent2"><span class="nm">2.</span><p>The first Ribuy (initially) includes everything, i.e. Charitzin u'Ne'itzin to forbid;</p></div>
<div class="indent2"><span class="nm">3.</span><p>A Ribuy Mi'ut Ribuy includes everything (except for what is totally unlike the Mi'ut);</p></div>
<div class="indent3"><span class="nm">i.</span><p>We include Charitzin u'Ne'itzin, to forbid;</p></div>
<div class="indent3"><span class="nm">ii.</span><p>We exclude pits and caves, to permit.</p></div>
<div class="indent2"><span class="nm">4.</span><p><span class="cl">Question:</span> Perhaps we include pits (to forbid), and exclude Kelim (to permit)!</p></div>
<div class="indent2"><span class="nm">5.</span><p><span class="cl">Answer:</span> If so, the repetition "you may eat" would not teach anything.</p></div>
<div class="indent2"><span class="nm">6.</span><p><span class="cl">Question:</span> We could say oppositely! (We include Charitzin u'Ne'itzin to permit, and exclude pits and caves to forbid.)</p></div>
<div class="indent2"><span class="nm">7.</span><p>Answer (Matisyahu ben Yehudah's Beraisa) Question: Why do we include pits and caves to permit, and exclude Charitzin u'Ne'itzin to forbid?</p></div>
<div class="indent3"><span class="nm">i.</span><p><span class="cl">Answer:</span> We include pits to permit, for they are still water, like in Kelim. We exclude Charitzin u'Ne'itzin and forbid, for they are not still, unlike Kelim.</p></div>
<div class="indent1"><span class="nm">(e)</span><p><span class="cl">Question:</span> (We said (3:e, 66b) that the Torah permitted fish without Simanim explicitly and Stam.) Which source is called explicit, and which is Stam?</p></div>
<div class="indent1"><span class="nm">(f)</span><p><span class="cl">Answer #1 (Rav Acha or Ravina):</span> "You may eat (... what has the Simanim)" is the explicit source. "(What lacks the Simanim... ) you may not eat" is Stam.</p></div>
<div class="indent2"><span class="nm">1.</span><p>The former is explicit, for it says "those you may eat" right after "in seas and rivers";</p></div>
<div class="indent2"><span class="nm">2.</span><p>The latter is Stam, for "you may not eat" is not written adjacent to "in seas and rivers."</p></div>
<div class="indent1"><span class="nm">(g)</span><p><span class="cl">Answer #2 (the other of Rav Acha and Ravina):</span> "You may eat" is Stam. "You may not eat" is explicit.</p></div>
<div class="indent2"><span class="nm">1.</span><p>The former is Stam, for we could have understood it to mean that in Kelim, all fish (even with Simanim) are forbidden;</p></div>
<div class="indent2"><span class="nm">2.</span><p>The latter is explicit, for it surely permits all fish in Kelim (and shows that also the former verse permits them).</p></div>
<div class="subject"><span class="nm">2)</span><p>CREATURES THAT NEVER LEFT THEIR PLACE</p></div>
<div class="indent1"><span class="nm">(a)</span><p><span class="cl">(Rav Huna):</span> One should not strain (date) beer through a wooden strainer at night, lest a worm alight on the strainer and fall into the cup;</p></div>
<div class="indent2"><span class="nm">1.</span><p>Since the worm (once) separated from the beer, it is considered "a Sheretz that swarms on the ground" (and is forbidden).</p></div>
<div class="indent1"><span class="nm">(b)</span><p><span class="cl">Question:</span> If so, one should not drink beer in a Kli, lest a worm alighted on the Kli and returned to the beer!</p></div>
<div class="indent1"><span class="nm">(c)</span><p><span class="cl">Answer:</span> In that case, it is considered as if the worm never left the water. (It is permitted.)</p></div>
<div class="indent1"><span class="nm">(d)</span><p><span class="cl">Support (Beraisa):</span> "You may eat anything in water" permits bending down to drink from pits (even though one may ingest worms).</p></div>
<div class="indent2"><span class="nm">1.</span><p><span class="cl">Question:</span> We should be concerned lest the worms alighted on the wall of the pit!</p></div>
<div class="indent2"><span class="nm">2.</span><p><span class="cl">Answer:</span> Since they never left the pit, they are permitted.</p></div>
<div class="indent2"><span class="nm">3.</span><p>Similarly, if a worm in beer separated to the Kli wall, it is still permitted.</p></div>
<div class="indent1"><span class="nm">(e)</span><p><span class="cl">Rav Chisda:</span> A Beraisa supports Rav Huna.</p></div>
<div class="indent2"><span class="nm">1.</span><p><span class="cl">(Beraisa):</span> "Every Sheretz that swarms on the ground" includes flies that were strained from wine.</p></div>
<div class="indent2"><span class="nm">2.</span><p><span class="cl">Inference:</span> Had they not been strained, they would be permitted.</p></div>
<div class="indent1"><span class="nm">(f)</span><p><span class="cl">(Shmuel):</span> If a gourd grew wormy while attached, the worms are forbidden due to "every Sheretz that swarms on the ground". (Since it is attached, it is as if the worm is on the ground.)</p></div>
<div class="bbbline">67b----------------------------------------67b</p></div>
<div class="indent1"><span class="nm">(g)</span><p><span class="cl">Suggestion:</span> An apparent contradiction of Beraisos supports Shmuel:</p></div>
<div class="indent2"><span class="nm">1.</span><p><span class="cl">(Beraisa #1):</span> "On the ground" excludes mites in lentils, chickpeas, dates and figs.</p></div>
<div class="indent2"><span class="nm">2.</span><p><span class="cl">Contradiction (Beraisa #2):</span> "Every Sheretz that swarms on the ground" includes worms in the roots of olives or vines.</p></div>
<div class="indent2"><span class="nm">3.</span><p><span class="cl">Answer:</span> Both Beraisos discuss mites in produce. In the former, they grew while the produce was attached. In the latter, they grew after it was detached.</p></div>
<div class="indent1"><span class="nm">(h)</span><p><span class="cl">Rejection:</span> No, in both Beraisos they grew when the produce was attached;</p></div>
<div class="indent2"><span class="nm">1.</span><p>Beraisa #1 discusses mites (that started) in the produce. Beraisa #2 discusses mites of the tree itself.</p></div>
<div class="indent2"><span class="nm">2.</span><p><span class="cl">Support:</span> Beraisa #2 says 'worms in the roots of olive trees or vines'.</p></div>
<div class="indent1"><span class="nm">(i)</span><p><span class="cl">Questions (Rav Yosef):</span> If a worm separated and died immediately, or, if it entered the air (but never landed on the ground), what is the law?</p></div>
<div class="indent1"><span class="nm">(j)</span><p><span class="cl">Questions (Rav Ashi):</span> What is the law if a worm separated to the outside of the date, or to the outside of the date pit, or from one date to another?</p></div>
<div class="indent1"><span class="nm">(k)</span><p>These questions are unresolved.</p></div>
<div class="subject"><span class="nm">3)</span><p>WORMS IN FISH</p></div>
<div class="indent1"><span class="nm">(a)</span><p><span class="cl">Version #1 (Rav Sheshes brei d'Rav Idi):</span> Worms (most Rishonim - in fish innards; Rashi - in the lungs or liver of an animal) are forbidden.</p></div>
<div class="indent2"><span class="nm">1.</span><p>This is because they came from outside, i.e. they were ingested.</p></div>
<div class="indent1"><span class="nm">(b)</span><p><span class="cl">Objection (Rav Ashi):</span> If they were ingested, they would be found (also) in the end of the digestive tract!</p></div>
<div class="indent1"><span class="nm">(c)</span><p><span class="cl">Version #2 (Rav Sheshes brei d'Rav Idi):</span> The worms are permitted.</p></div>
<div class="indent2"><span class="nm">1.</span><p>This is because they grow from it (the fish or animal) itself.</p></div>
<div class="indent1"><span class="nm">(d)</span><p><span class="cl">(Rav Ashi):</span> This is obvious. If they were ingested, they would be found in the end of the digestive tract! (end of Version #2)</p></div>
<div class="indent1"><span class="nm">(e)</span><p>The Halachah is, they are forbidden, because they enter through the respiratory system during sleep.</p></div>
<div class="indent1"><span class="nm">(f)</span><p>Worms underneath the skin in animals are forbidden. In fish, they are permitted.</p></div>
<div class="indent2"><span class="nm">1.</span><p>Ravina asked his mother to mix fish worms with his fish, so he would eat them without seeing them.</p></div>
<div class="indent1"><span class="nm">(g)</span><p><span class="cl">Question (Rav Mesharshiya brei d'Rav Acha):</span> What is the difference between worms in animals and worms in fish?</p></div>
<div class="indent1"><span class="nm">(h)</span><p><span class="cl">Answer (Ravina):</span> Animals (and worms inside) are forbidden until slaughtered. Shechitah does not permit the worm;</p></div>
<div class="indent2"><span class="nm">1.</span><p>Fish are permitted without Shechitah, so also worms that grow inside are permitted.</p></div>
<div class="indent1"><span class="nm">(i)</span><p><span class="cl">(Beraisa):</span> "That goes on its belly" refers to a snake. "All" includes long worms. "Four legs" refers to a scorpion. "All that goes" includes beetles. "Many legs" refers to a centipede. "Until every" includes similar species, and species similar to those.</p></div>
<div class="indent1"><span class="nm">(j)</span><p><span class="cl">(Beraisa - R. Yosi Dormaskus):</span> Livyason (a giant sea creature that Tzadikim will eat in the end of days) is a Tahor fish.</p></div>
<div class="indent2"><span class="nm">1.</span><p>"Its protection" is its scales. "Under it are rays of sun" are its fins.</p></div>
