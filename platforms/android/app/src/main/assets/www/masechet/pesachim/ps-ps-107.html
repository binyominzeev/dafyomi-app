<div class="subject"><span class="nm">1)</span><p>THE LAST TIME FOR HAVDALAH</p></div>
<div class="indent1"><span class="nm">(a)</span><p><span class="cl">Version #1 (Rava):</span> The Halachah is, if one ate, he is Mekadesh; if one ate, he is Mavdil;</p></div>
<div class="indent1"><span class="nm">(b)</span><p>If one did not say Kidush on Shabbos night, he says it any time during the day, until Motza'ei Shabbos.</p></div>
<div class="indent1"><span class="nm">(c)</span><p>If one did not make Havdalah on Motza'ei Shabbos, he is Mavdil any time during the week;</p></div>
<div class="indent1"><span class="nm">(d)</span><p><span class="cl">Version #2 - Ameimar - (Rava):</span> The Halachah is, if one ate, he is Mekadesh; if one ate, he is Mavdil;</p></div>
<div class="indent1"><span class="nm">(e)</span><p>If one did not say Kidush on Shabbos night, he says it any time during the day.</p></div>
<div class="indent1"><span class="nm">(f)</span><p>If one did not make Havdalah on Motza'ei Shabbos, he is Mavdil any time during the <i>day</i>. (end of Version #2)</p></div>
<div class="indent1"><span class="nm">(g)</span><p><span class="cl">Rav Chisda sons:</span> Once, Ameimar visited us, and we did not have wine; we gave him beer, but he did not Mavdil - he spent the night without eating;</p></div>
<div class="indent2"><span class="nm">1.</span><p>The next day we toiled and obtained wine for him - he was Mavdil and ate.</p></div>
<div class="indent1"><span class="nm">(h)</span><p>The following year he visited us, and we did not have wine; we gave him beer - he said, this shows that it Chemar Medinah (the [substitute for] wine in the locale, the most esteemed drink) - he was Mavdil over it and ate.</p></div>
<div class="indent1"><span class="nm">(i)</span><p>We learn three things from this:</p></div>
<div class="indent2"><span class="nm">1.</span><p>One who says Havdalah in Shemoneh Esre must say Havdalah over a cup;</p></div>
<div class="indent2"><span class="nm">2.</span><p>It is forbidden to eat before Havdalah;</p></div>
<div class="indent2"><span class="nm">3.</span><p>If one was not Mavdil on Motza'ei Shabbos, he is Mavdil any time during the week. (Really, the episode only shows that he is Mavdil during the day - it says 'the whole week' (i.e. until Wednesday) because this is the Halachah. Rashbam - we also learn that Chemar Medinah may be used in place of wine, but we count only things related to the Chiyuv and time to say Havdalah. Alternatively, when there is no wine around this is obvious!)</p></div>
<div class="subject"><span class="nm">2)</span><p>MAY ONE MAKE KIDUSH ON BEER?</p></div>
<div class="indent1"><span class="nm">(a)</span><p><span class="cl">Question (Rav Chisda):</span> May one say Kidush on beer?</p></div>
<div class="indent1"><span class="nm">(b)</span><p><span class="cl">Rav Huna:</span> Regarding beer made from barley, figs or berries of a bush, I asked Rav, who [had] asked R. Chiya, who asked Rebbi, and he did not answer - do you ask about standard [date] beer, which is less esteemed?! (It is definitely invalid.)</p></div>
<div class="indent1"><span class="nm">(c)</span><p><span class="cl">Assumption:</span> One may not use it for Kidush, but it may be used for Havdalah.</p></div>
<div class="indent1"><span class="nm">(d)</span><p><span class="cl">Rejection (Rav Chisda citing Rav and Rav Tachlifa bar Avimi citing Shmuel):</span> No - just like one may not use it for Kidush, he may not use it for Havdalah.</p></div>
<div class="indent1"><span class="nm">(e)</span><p>Levi sent to Rebbi beer made by pouring water on dates 13 times (new dates each time); Rebbi found it to be extremely tasty - he said that it is fit to make Kidush on it and say over it all songs and praises;</p></div>
<div class="indent2"><span class="nm">1.</span><p>At night he had pain (diarrhea) - he said, it afflicts and entices [people to drink it, through its taste - R. Chananel; Rashi - it afflicts, but at the time of drinking it is fit to appease Hash-m (say Kidush over it); Rashbam - is it fit to appease with something that pains like this?]!</p></div>
<div class="indent1"><span class="nm">(f)</span><p><span class="cl">(Rav Yosef):</span> I will take a vow in public (he holds that such a vow cannot be annulled) not to drink beer.</p></div>
<div class="indent1"><span class="nm">(g)</span><p><span class="cl">(Rava):</span> I would sooner drink water in which flax was soaked (it is extremely putrid, even washing in it is painful - Nedarim 80B) than beer.</p></div>
<div class="indent2"><span class="nm">1.</span><p><span class="cl">(Rava):</span> One who makes Kidush on beer should [be punished with poverty and] have only beer to drink.</p></div>
<div class="indent1"><span class="nm">(h)</span><p>Rav Huna saw Rav Mekadesh on beer. He suggested 'Did you start to profit through beer [and therefore you prefer it?]'</p></div>
<div class="indent1"><span class="nm">(i)</span><p><span class="cl">(Beraisa):</span> One may say Kidush only on wine; one blesses only on wine.</p></div>
<div class="indent1"><span class="nm">(j)</span><p><span class="cl">Objection:</span> Surely, one blesses sheha'Kol Nihyah bi'Dvaro even on beer and water!</p></div>
<div class="indent1"><span class="nm">(k)</span><p><span class="cl">Answer (Abaye):</span> It means that, we say Birkas ha'Mazon only over a cup of wine.</p></div>
<div class="indent1"><span class="nm">(l)</span><p><span class="cl">(Beraisa):</span> One may not make Kidush on beer;</p></div>
<div class="indent1"><span class="nm">(m)</span><p>R. Elazar b'Rebbi Shimon permits.</p></div>
<div class="indent1"><span class="nm">(n)</span><p>It suffices to taste any amount of the wine [of Kidush];</p></div>
<div class="indent1"><span class="nm">(o)</span><p>R. Yosi b'Rebbi Yehudah says, one must drink Malei Lugmav (enough to fill one cheek when he puts the liquid on one side).</p></div>
<div class="indent1"><span class="nm">(p)</span><p><span class="cl">(Rav Huna, and Rav Gidal of Narash's Beraisa):</span> One who makes Kidush is Yotzei only if he drinks Malei Lugmav.</p></div>
<div class="indent1"><span class="nm">(q)</span><p><span class="cl">Rav Nachman bar Yitzchak:</span> The Beraisa was not said by Gidul bar Menasiya or Gidul Bar Minyomi, rather, by Gidul Stam (his father's name was not mentioned).</p></div>
<div class="indent1"><span class="nm">(r)</span><p><span class="cl">Question:</span> What difference does it make?</p></div>
<div class="indent1"><span class="nm">(s)</span><p><span class="cl">Answer:</span> We must know who said it in order to ask a contradiction from something else that he said.</p></div>
<div class="subject"><span class="nm">3)</span><p>THE ISUR TO EAT ON EREV PESACH</p></div>
<div class="indent1"><span class="nm">(a)</span><p><span class="cl">(Mishnah):</span> From shortly before Minchah [on Erev Pesach one may not eat...]</p></div>
<div class="indent1"><span class="nm">(b)</span><p><span class="cl">Question:</span> Does this mean shortly before Minchah Gedolah (the longer period during which one may pray Minchah - it starts at six and a half hours of the day), or shortly before Minchah Ketanah (the shorter period for Minchah - it starts at nine and a half hours)?</p></div>
<div class="indent2"><span class="nm">1.</span><p>If it means before Minchah Gedolah, it is forbidden [to eat then] on account of Pesach, lest the meal get drawn out, and he will neglect to offer Pesach;</p></div>
<div class="bbbline">107b----------------------------------------107b</p></div>
<div class="indent2"><span class="nm">2.</span><p>If it means before Minchah Ketanah, it is forbidden on account of Matzah, lest he will be stuffed, and eating Matzah at night will be Achilah Gasah (gorging himself)!</p></div>
<div class="indent1"><span class="nm">(c)</span><p><span class="cl">Answer (Ravina - Beraisa):</span> Even Melech Agripas, who normally ate (began his first meal) during the ninth hour, may not eat until dark.</p></div>
<div class="indent2"><span class="nm">1.</span><p>If it means before Minchah Ketanah, we understand why it says <i>even</i> Agripas (even though he has not eaten yet, and it is before the forbidden time, he may not begin because his meal will extend to when it is forbidden);</p></div>
<div class="indent2"><span class="nm">2.</span><p>But if it means before Minchah Gedolah, why does it say <i>even</i> Agripas (it is already forbidden to eat, surely he may not begin)!</p></div>
<div class="indent2"><span class="nm">3.</span><p><span class="cl">Conclusion:</span> It means before Minchah Ketanah.</p></div>
<div class="indent1"><span class="nm">(d)</span><p><span class="cl">Question:</span> Still, why does it say 'even'? His meal will extend to when it is forbidden (in such a case no one may begin)!</p></div>
<div class="indent1"><span class="nm">(e)</span><p><span class="cl">Answer:</span> One might have thought that nine hours for Agripas is like four hours (the meal time) for common people (i.e. he can eat at his usual time and will be able to eat Matzah at night with appetite) - the Beraisa teaches that this is not so.</p></div>
<div class="indent1"><span class="nm">(f)</span><p><span class="cl">(R. Asi):</span> One may not eat a meal [with Matzah] then, but he may dip and eat Targima (produce; alternatively, Mezonos or other foods).</p></div>
<div class="indent1"><span class="nm">(g)</span><p>R. Yitzchak used to eat dipped vegetables at this time [to arouse his appetite for Matzah].</p></div>
<div class="indent1"><span class="nm">(h)</span><p><span class="cl">Support (Beraisa):</span> A servant [preparing the food for the night] may eat from the intestines [of animals other than Pesach] and give to guests (Rashbam - this helps arouse appetite).</p></div>
<div class="indent2"><span class="nm">1.</span><p>There is a hint, not a proof, of this - "Niru Lachem Nir v'Al Tizre'u El Kotzim" (plowing helps the field properly absorb the seeds - likewise, eating things that do not satiate expand the intestines and enable one to eat with appetite).</p></div>
<div class="indent1"><span class="nm">(i)</span><p>Rava used to drink wine every Erev Pesach to arouse his appetite, in order to eat much Matzah.</p></div>
