<p class="bas indent1"><span class="nm">(a)</span>Bil'am blessed Yisrael to be like a cedar tree, which does not grow near water, does not grow back when cut, has few roots, and the (other) strong winds do not uproot it, but the south wind topples it.</p>
<p class="bas indent2"><span class="nm">1.</span>Another advantage of a reed (over a cedar) is that it is used to write Torah, Nevi'im and Kesuvim.</p>
<p class="bas indent1"><span class="nm">(b)</span>"Va'Yar Es ha'Keini" - Bil'am asked Yisro 'you were with us when Paro took counsel (how to thwart the savior of Yisrael). Who sat you among the mighty of the world (your descendants will sit on the Great Sanhedrin)?'</p>
<p class="bas indent2"><span class="nm">1.</span><span class="cl">(R. Chiya bar Aba):</span> Paro took counsel with three - Bil'am, Iyov and Yisro;</p>
<p class="bas indent2"><span class="nm">2.</span>Bil'am counseled (to drown the baby boys in the river). He was killed;</p>
<p class="bas indent2"><span class="nm">3.</span>Iyov was silent. He received great afflictions;</p>
<p class="bas indent2"><span class="nm">4.</span>Yisro fled. He merited that his descendants sit on the Great Sanhedrin - "umi'Mishpechos Sofrim... ha'Kinim ha'Ba'im me'Chamas Avi Beis Rechav" (Bnei Rechav will be on the Sanhedrin), and it says "u'Vnei Keini Chosen Moshe."</p>
<p class="bas indent1"><span class="nm">(c)</span>"Va'Yisa Meshalo va'Yomar Oy Mi Yichyeh mi'Sumo Kel" - woe to the nation that will (be subjugating Yisrael) when Hash-m decides to redeem them. Who can stop two lions from mating?!</p>
<p class="bas indent1"><span class="nm">(d)</span><span class="cl">(Rav):</span> "V'Tzim mi'Yad Kitim" refers to great ships from Liba Aspir (Rashi; Aruch - Roman legions).</p>
<p class="bas indent1"><span class="nm">(e)</span>"V'Inu Ashur v'Inu Ever" - they will kill everyone until Ashur. From there on, they will subjugate the nations.</p>
<p class="bas subject"><span class="nm">2)</span>BIL'AM'S COUNSEL</p>
<p class="bas indent1"><span class="nm">(a)</span><span class="cl">Question:</span> Why does it say "Lecha I'atzcha Asher Ya'aseh ha'Am ha'Zeh l'Amcha"? It should say 'I will counsel what <i>your</i> nation should do to <i>this</i> nation!</p>
<p class="bas indent1"><span class="nm">(b)</span><span class="cl">Answer:</span> The Torah did not want to it sound as if Yisrael was cursed. (Alternatively, Bil'am did not want it to sound as if Mo'av needs to take counsel against Yisrael.)</p>
<p class="bas indent2"><span class="nm">1.</span><span class="cl">Bil'am (to Balak):</span> Hash-m hates Zimah, and Yisrael love linen garments. Make curtains, have old harlots selling linen garments outside, and young harlots selling inside.</p>
<p class="bas indent2"><span class="nm">2.</span>They made curtains from Har Sheleg until Beis ha'Yshimos. Yisrael ate, drank and were merry. The old harlots offered the curtains for their true value. The young ones sold it for less.</p>
<p class="bas indent3"><span class="nm">i.</span>After two or three sales, the young ones said 'you are like family. Take what you want (for free).' They had Amoni wine with them (this was before Chachamim forbade Nochri wine). The Yisrael drank, his Yetzer was aroused, and he asked to have Bi'ah with her. She took out an idol, and said that first he must serve it.</p>
<p class="bas indent3"><span class="nm">ii.</span><span class="cl">The Yisrael:</span> I am a Yisrael. I do not serve idolatry!</p>
<p class="bas indent3"><span class="nm">iii.</span><span class="cl">The harlot:</span> I ask you only to excrete in front of it! (Yisrael did not know that this is the way Ba'al Pe'or is served.)</p>
<p class="bas indent3"><span class="nm">iv.</span><span class="cl">The harlot:</span> I do not consent to Bi'ah until you deny the entire Torah of Moshe - "va'Yinazru la'Boshes va'Yihyu Shikutzim k'Ahavam."</p>
<p class="bas indent1"><span class="nm">(c)</span><span class="cl">(R. Eliezer):</span> "Va'Yeshev Yisrael <i>ba'Shitim</i>" - Shitim is its name.</p>
<p class="bas indent1"><span class="nm">(d)</span><span class="cl">(R. Yehoshua):</span> It is called Shitim because Yisrael engaged in Shtus (foolishness) there.</p>
<p class="bas indent1"><span class="nm">(e)</span><span class="cl">(R. Eliezer):</span> "<i>Va'Tikrena</i> la'Am l'Zivchei Eloheihen" - Yisrael encountered their very bodies (i.e. unclothed).</p>
<p class="bas indent1"><span class="nm">(f)</span><span class="cl">(R. Yehoshua):</span> The Yisraelim had emissions of Keri (semen).</p>
<p class="bas indent1"><span class="nm">(g)</span><span class="cl">Question:</span> What is the meaning of the name Refidim (where Amalek attacked Yisrael)?</p>
<p class="bas indent1"><span class="nm">(h)</span><span class="cl">Answer #1 (R. Eliezer):</span> This is its name.</p>
<p class="bas indent1"><span class="nm">(i)</span><span class="cl">(R. Yehoshua):</span> It is called Refidim because Yisrael slackened (Rifu) from learning Torah there -"Lo Hifnu Avos El Banim (to correct their ways) me'Rifyon Yadayim."</p>
<p class="bas indent1"><span class="nm">(j)</span><span class="cl">(R. Yochanan):</span> Wherever it says "va'Yeshev", this denotes misfortune:</p>
<p class="bas indent2"><span class="nm">1.</span>"Va'Yeshev Yisrael ba'Shitim (and they sinned with Bnos Mo'av)";</p>
<p class="bas indent2"><span class="nm">2.</span>"Va'Yeshev Yakov b'Eretz Megurei Aviv" - Yosef brought bad reports about his brothers (and was sold to Mitzrayim);</p>
<p class="bas indent2"><span class="nm">3.</span>"Va'Yeshev Yisrael... b'Eretz Goshen... va'Yikrevu Yemei Yisrael Lamus";</p>
<p class="bas indent2"><span class="nm">4.</span>"Va'Yeshev Yehudah v'Yisrael la'Vetach... va'Yakam Hash-m Satan li'Shlomo Es Hadad ha'Adomi."</p>
<p class="bas indent1"><span class="nm">(k)</span><span class="cl">Question:</span> "V'Es Malchei Midyan Hargu Al Chaleleihem... v'Es Bil'am" - why was Bil'am with Midyan? (Earlier, he said that he would return to his nation!)</p>
<p class="bas indent1"><span class="nm">(l)</span><span class="cl">Answer (R. Yochanan):</span> He went to collect reward for (his counsel, which caused) the death of 24,000 Yisraelim.</p>
<p class="bas indent2"><span class="nm">1.</span><span class="cl">(Mar Zutra bar Tuvya):</span> This is like people say, the camel asked for horns, and they cut off its ears. (So too, Bil'am went to get reward, and he was killed.)</p>
<p class="bas indent1"><span class="nm">(m)</span><span class="cl">Question:</span> WHy does it say "v'Es Bil'am... ha'Kosem"? He was not just a magician. He was a Navi!</p>
<p class="bas indent1"><span class="nm">(n)</span><span class="cl">Answer (R. Yochanan):</span> At first he was a Navi. In the end (Ramah - after he counseled to make Yisrael sin, he lost his Ru'ach ha'Kodesh, but he still strove to know the future), he was (only) a magician.</p>
<p class="bas indent2"><span class="nm">1.</span><span class="cl">(Rav Papa):</span> This is like people say, the former wife of a prince was Mezanah with people who pull ships (Rashi; Ramah - she will marry only someone else who bears something resembling weapons, such as a carpenter).</p>
<p class="bas bbbline">106b----------------------------------------106b</p>
<p class="bas indent1"><span class="nm">(o)</span><span class="cl">(Rav):</span> "Horgu Bnei Yisrael ba'Cherev El Chaleleihem (plural)" - they performed all four Misos Beis Din on Bil'am.</p>
<p class="bas indent1"><span class="nm">(p)</span><span class="cl">A Min:</span> Do you know how old Bil'am was?</p>
<p class="bas indent1"><span class="nm">(q)</span><span class="cl">R. Chanina:</span> It does not say explicitly, but since it says "Anshei Damim u'Mirmah Lo Yechetzu Yemeihem" (Resha'im will not live even half a normal lifetime, i.e. 35 years), presumably he lived 33 or 34 years.</p>
<p class="bas indent1"><span class="nm">(r)</span><span class="cl">The Min:</span> You are correct. The annals ('Rashi' on Avos - tombstone) of Bil'am say(s) 'the lame Bil'am was 33 years old when (the army led by) Pinchas killed him.'</p>
<p class="bas subject"><span class="nm">3)</span>DO'EG</p>
<p class="bas indent1"><span class="nm">(a)</span><span class="cl">(Mar brei d'Ravina):</span> Do not expound the names of those who have no share in the world to come (to demean them), except for Bil'am.</p>
<p class="bas indent1"><span class="nm">(b)</span><span class="cl">Question:</span> Elsewhere, Do'eg is written "Doyeg"!</p>
<p class="bas indent1"><span class="nm">(c)</span><span class="cl">Answer (R. Yochanan):</span> At first, Hash-m was Do'eg (concerned lest he sin. After he sinned, Hash-m said Vai (woe, alluded to by the Vov-Yud in Doyeg) that he sinned.</p>
<p class="bas indent1"><span class="nm">(d)</span><span class="cl">Question (R. Yitzchak):</span> What does it mean "Mah Tis'halel b'Ra'ah ha'Gibor Chesed Kel Kol ha'Yom"?</p>
<p class="bas indent1"><span class="nm">(e)</span><span class="cl">Answer:</span> Hash-m said to Do'eg 'you are awesome in Torah. Why do you exalt yourself in evil? My Chesed is over you all day!'</p>
<p class="bas indent1"><span class="nm">(f)</span><span class="cl">Question (R. Yitzchak):</span> What does it mean "vela'Rasha Amar Elokim Mah Lecha Lesaper Chuki"?</p>
<p class="bas indent1"><span class="nm">(g)</span><span class="cl">Answer:</span> Hash-m said to Do'eg 'why do you learn My Torah? What do you expound in the Parshiyos of murder and Lashon ha'Ra (you killed the Kohanim of Nov, and slandered David)!</p>
<p class="bas indent1"><span class="nm">(h)</span><span class="cl">(R. Ami):</span> "Va'Tisa Vrisi Alei Ficha" - Do'eg's Torah was from the lips and outward, i.e. superficial. He did not internalize it.</p>
<p class="bas indent1"><span class="nm">(i)</span><span class="cl">(R. Yitzchak):</span> "Va'Yir'u Tzadikim va'Yira'u v'Alav Yischaku" - at first Tzadikim saw Do'eg's success and feared that people would learn from his sinful ways. When he died before half his (normal allotment of) years, they laughed.</p>
<p class="bas indent1"><span class="nm">(j)</span><span class="cl">Question (R. Yitzchak):</span> What does it mean "Chayil Bola..."?</p>
<p class="bas indent1"><span class="nm">(k)</span><span class="cl">Answer:</span> David asked Hash-m to kill Do'eg;</p>
<p class="bas indent2"><span class="nm">1.</span><span class="cl">Hash-m:</span> "Chayil Bola va'Yaki'enu" (he has learned a great amount of Torah. Wait until he forgets it.)</p>
<p class="bas indent2"><span class="nm">2.</span><span class="cl">David:</span> "Mi'Bitno Yorishenu Kel" - cause him to forget it soon!</p>
<p class="bas indent1"><span class="nm">(l)</span><span class="cl">Question (R. Yitzchak):</span> What does it mean "Gam Kel Yitatzcha"?</p>
<p class="bas indent1"><span class="nm">(m)</span><span class="cl">Answer:</span> Hash-m asked David if Do'eg should be in the world to come;</p>
<p class="bas indent2"><span class="nm">1.</span><span class="cl">David:</span> "Gam Kel Yitatzcha la'Netzach" (eternally destroy him).</p>
<p class="bas indent2"><span class="nm">2.</span><span class="cl">Hash-m:</span> Let teachings be said in Do'eg's name.</p>
<p class="bas indent2"><span class="nm">3.</span><span class="cl">David:</span> "Yachtecha v'Yisachacha me'Ohel" (uproot him from the Beis Medrash).</p>
<p class="bas indent2"><span class="nm">4.</span><span class="cl">Hash-m:</span> His children should be Chachamim!</p>
<p class="bas indent2"><span class="nm">5.</span><span class="cl">David:</span> "V'Shereshcha me'Eretz Chayim" (his progeny should be cut off from Torah).</p>
<p class="bas indent1"><span class="nm">(n)</span><span class="cl">(R. Yitzchak):</span> "Ayei Sofer" - where is the one (Do'eg) who could count all the (extra and missing) letters of the Torah?</p>
<p class="bas indent2"><span class="nm">1.</span>"Ayei Shokel" - where is the one who could weigh all the Kal va'Chomerim in the Torah?</p>
<p class="bas indent2"><span class="nm">2.</span>"Ayei Sofer Es ha'Migdalim" - Do'eg knew 300 laws of (Tum'ah of) airborne towers.</p>
<p class="bas indent2"><span class="nm">3.</span><span class="cl">(Rav):</span> Do'eg and Achitofel had 400 questions about airborne towers. They did not resolve any of them.</p>
<p class="bas indent1"><span class="nm">(o)</span><span class="cl">(Rava):</span> Asking questions (and learning) does not show greatness (in Hash-m's eyes)!</p>
<p class="bas indent2"><span class="nm">1.</span>In the days of Rav Yehudah, all the learning was focused on Seder Nezikim. Today we learn (all six Sedorim of the Mishnah, up to the last tractate) Uktzim (Tum'ah of stems);</p>
<p class="bas indent2"><span class="nm">2.</span>When Rav Yehudah reached the Mishnah about a woman preserving vegetables in a pot, he could not explain why they are Tehorim. We have 13 academies learning Uktzim!</p>
<p class="bas indent2"><span class="nm">3.</span>When they needed rain, Rav Yehudah would remove one shoe (he intended to remove both and to pray with great humility), and the rain came immediately. We cry to Hash-m all day, and we are not answered!</p>
<p class="bas indent2"><span class="nm">4.</span>This is because Hash-m desires a person's heart (and their hearts were much more devoted to Hash-m) - "va'Shem Yir'eh la'Levav."</p>
<p class="bas subject"><span class="nm">4)</span>DO'EG AND ACHITOFEL</p>
<p class="bas indent1"><span class="nm">(a)</span><span class="cl">(Rav Mesharshiya):</span> Do'eg and Achitofel could not explain Halachos.</p>
<p class="bas indent1"><span class="nm">(b)</span><span class="cl">Objection (Mar Zutra):</span> It says "Ayei Sofer Ayei Shokel." You cannot say that Do'eg could not explain Halachos!</p>
<p class="bas indent1"><span class="nm">(c)</span><span class="cl">Correction:</span> Rather, they could not reach the correct Halachah - "Sod Hash-m li'Re'av."</p>
<p class="bas indent1"><span class="nm">(d)</span><span class="cl">(R. Ami):</span> Do'eg forgot all his Torah before he died - "Hu Yamus b'Ein Musar..."</p>
<p class="bas indent1"><span class="nm">(e)</span><span class="cl">(Rav):</span> He became a Metzora - "<i>Hitzmatah</i> Kol Zoneh Mimeka", the Targum of Tzemisus is 'la'Chalutin' (which refers to Tzara'as);</p>
<p class="bas indent2"><span class="nm">1.</span><span class="cl">(Mishnah):</span> The only difference between a Musgar (quarantined) and a <i>Muchlat</i> (fully Tamei) Metzora is that the latter must tear his clothes and let his hair grow.</p>
<p class="bas indent1"><span class="nm">(f)</span><span class="cl">(R. Yochanan):</span> Three damaging angels came to Do'eg. One made him forget his Torah, one burned his Neshamah, and one scattered his dirt in Batei Keneses and Batei Medrash.</p>
<p class="bas indent1"><span class="nm">(g)</span><span class="cl">(R. Yochanan):</span> The lives of Do'eg and Achitofel did not overlap. Do'eg was in the days of Sha'ul, and Achitofel was in the days of David (after Sha'ul died).</p>
<p class="bas indent1"><span class="nm">(h)</span><span class="cl">(Beraisa):</span> "Anshei Damim u'Mirmah Lo Yechetzu Yemeihem" - Do'eg lived 34 years, and Achitofel lived 33.</p>
<p class="bas indent1"><span class="nm">(i)</span><span class="cl">(R. Yochanan):</span> At first, David called Achitofel his teacher - "v'Atah Enosh k'Erki Alufi (teacher) u'Meyuda'i";</p>
<p class="bas indent2"><span class="nm">1.</span>Later he called him his colleague - "Yachdav Namtik Sod." In the end, he called him his Talmid - "Ochel Lachmi (he learns from me) Higdil Alai Akev."</p>
