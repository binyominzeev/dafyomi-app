<div class="indent1"><span class="nm">(a)</span><p>R. Yitzchak bar Bisna lost the keys to the Beis Medrash in a Reshus ha'Rabim on Shabbos.</p></div>
<div class="indent2"><span class="nm">1.</span><p><span class="cl">R. Pedas:</span> Get children to play there. If they find the keys, they will bring them.</p></div>
<div class="indent2"><span class="nm">2.</span><p>He holds that if a child is eating forbidden food (or doing any other Isur), Beis Din need not stop him.</p></div>
<div class="indent1"><span class="nm">(b)</span><p><span class="cl">Support (Beraisa):</span> A man should not tell a child 'bring to me a key [through Reshus ha'Rabim]' or 'bring to me a stamp' but he may allow the child to uproot or throw things.</p></div>
<div class="indent1"><span class="nm">(c)</span><p><span class="cl">Rejection (Abaye):</span> The case is, he uproots from a flowerpot without holes (what grows inside is not considered attached to the ground) or throws in a Karmelis (these are forbidden only mid'Rabanan).</p></div>
<div class="indent1"><span class="nm">(d)</span><p><span class="cl">Question (Mishnah):</span> If a Nochri comes to extinguish a fire, we do not tell him 'extinguish' or 'don't extinguish', since we are not commanded that he rest;</p></div>
<div class="indent2"><span class="nm">1.</span><p>If a child comes to extinguish, we tell him 'don't extinguish', since we are commanded that he rest on Shabbos.</p></div>
<div class="indent1"><span class="nm">(e)</span><p><span class="cl">Answer (R. Yochanan):</span> It is forbidden when the child does so to please his father.</p></div>
<div class="indent1"><span class="nm">(f)</span><p><span class="cl">Question:</span> If so, similarly the Nochri does so to please the Yisrael. This is forbidden!</p></div>
<div class="indent1"><span class="nm">(g)</span><p><span class="cl">Answer:</span> A Nochri acts in his own interest.</p></div>
<div class="indent1"><span class="nm">(h)</span><p><span class="cl">Support (Beraisa):</span> If the son of a Chaver (one trustworthy about Ma'aser) often goes to his mother's father's house (who is not trustworthy), we are not concerned lest they feed him Tevel. If the father finds food in his son's hand, he is not responsible.</p></div>
<div class="indent1"><span class="nm">(i)</span><p><span class="cl">Rejection (R. Yochanan):</span> This is no support. We are more lenient about Demai (doubtfully tithed produce).</p></div>
<div class="indent1"><span class="nm">(j)</span><p><span class="cl">Inference:</span> If it were definitely Tevel, he would need to Ma'aser it.</p></div>
<div class="indent1"><span class="nm">(k)</span><p><span class="cl">Contradiction:</span> Above, R. Yochanan answered 'he acts on his father's volition' (but we need not stop minors who transgress for their own benefit)!</p></div>
<div class="indent1"><span class="nm">(l)</span><p><span class="cl">Answer:</span> R. Yochanan is in doubt what is the Halachah. He rejects the proofs for both opinions.</p></div>
<div class="indent1"><span class="nm">(m)</span><p><span class="cl">Support (Beraisa):</span> If the son of a Kohen Chaver (who is reliable regarding Taharah) often goes to the house of his mother's father, an ignoramus Kohen, we are not concerned lest they feed him Tamei Terumah. If the father finds food in his hand, he is not responsible.</p></div>

<div class="indent2"><span class="nm">2.</span><p>If there is no danger, it should be forbidden even on Yom Tov!</p></div>
<div class="indent1"><span class="nm">(c)</span><p><span class="cl">Answer:</span> The case is, they were in pain. He holds that nursing is Mefarek (extracting) in an unskillful manner, which is forbidden only mid'Rabanan.</p></div>
<div class="indent2"><span class="nm">1.</span><p>On Shabbos one (who is Mefarek normally) is liable to stoning, therefore Chachamim decreed (against unskillful Mefarek, e.g. nursing, even though he is in pain);</p></div>
<div class="indent2"><span class="nm">2.</span><p>Skilled Melachah on Yom Tov is only a Lav, so they did not decree to forbid one in pain.</p></div>

<div class="indent2"><span class="nm">1.</span><p>Had the Torah taught only about Sheratzim, one might have thought that this is because the Isur applies to any amount (if it is a full creature - Tosfos), but adults may feed blood to minors, for the Shi'ur (to be liable) for blood is a Revi'is;</p></div>
<div class="indent2"><span class="nm">2.</span><p>Had the Torah taught only regarding blood, one might have thought that this is because there is Kares for eating blood; but adults may feed Sheratzim to minors.</p></div>
<div class="indent2"><span class="nm">3.</span><p>Had the Torah taught only these two, one might have thought that this is because the Isur applies to everyone; but since Tum'ah applies only to Kohanim, adults may make minors Tamei.</p></div>
