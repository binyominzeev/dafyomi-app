<p class="bas indent1"><span class="nm">(a)</span>R. Yitzchak bar Bisna lost the keys to the Beis Medrash in a Reshus ha'Rabim on Shabbos.</p>
<p class="bas indent2"><span class="nm">1.</span><span class="cl">R. Pedas:</span> Get children to play there. If they find the keys, they will bring them.</p>
<p class="bas indent2"><span class="nm">2.</span>He holds that if a child is eating forbidden food (or doing any other Isur), Beis Din need not stop him.</p>
<p class="bas indent1"><span class="nm">(b)</span><span class="cl">Support (Beraisa):</span> A man should not tell a child 'bring to me a key [through Reshus ha'Rabim]' or 'bring to me a stamp' but he may allow the child to uproot or throw things.</p>
<p class="bas indent1"><span class="nm">(c)</span><span class="cl">Rejection (Abaye):</span> The case is, he uproots from a flowerpot without holes (what grows inside is not considered attached to the ground) or throws in a Karmelis (these are forbidden only mid'Rabanan).</p>
<p class="bas indent1"><span class="nm">(d)</span><span class="cl">Question (Mishnah):</span> If a Nochri comes to extinguish a fire, we do not tell him 'extinguish' or 'don't extinguish', since we are not commanded that he rest;</p>
<p class="bas indent2"><span class="nm">1.</span>If a child comes to extinguish, we tell him 'don't extinguish', since we are commanded that he rest on Shabbos.</p>
<p class="bas indent1"><span class="nm">(e)</span><span class="cl">Answer (R. Yochanan):</span> It is forbidden when the child does so to please his father.</p>
<p class="bas indent1"><span class="nm">(f)</span><span class="cl">Question:</span> If so, similarly the Nochri does so to please the Yisrael. This is forbidden!</p>
<p class="bas indent1"><span class="nm">(g)</span><span class="cl">Answer:</span> A Nochri acts in his own interest.</p>
<p class="bas indent1"><span class="nm">(h)</span><span class="cl">Support (Beraisa):</span> If the son of a Chaver (one trustworthy about Ma'aser) often goes to his mother's father's house (who is not trustworthy), we are not concerned lest they feed him Tevel. If the father finds food in his son's hand, he is not responsible.</p>
<p class="bas indent1"><span class="nm">(i)</span><span class="cl">Rejection (R. Yochanan):</span> This is no support. We are more lenient about Demai (doubtfully tithed produce).</p>
<p class="bas indent1"><span class="nm">(j)</span><span class="cl">Inference:</span> If it were definitely Tevel, he would need to Ma'aser it.</p>
<p class="bas indent1"><span class="nm">(k)</span><span class="cl">Contradiction:</span> Above, R. Yochanan answered 'he acts on his father's volition' (but we need not stop minors who transgress for their own benefit)!</p>
<p class="bas indent1"><span class="nm">(l)</span><span class="cl">Answer:</span> R. Yochanan is in doubt what is the Halachah. He rejects the proofs for both opinions.</p>
<p class="bas indent1"><span class="nm">(m)</span><span class="cl">Support (Beraisa):</span> If the son of a Kohen Chaver (who is reliable regarding Taharah) often goes to the house of his mother's father, an ignoramus Kohen, we are not concerned lest they feed him Tamei Terumah. If the father finds food in his hand, he is not responsible.</p>
<p class="bas indent1"><span class="nm">(n)</span><span class="cl">Rejection:</span> This is no support. The Beraisa discusses Terumah mid'Rabanan.</p>
<p class="bas indent1"><span class="nm">(o)</span><span class="cl">Support (Beraisa):</span> A child may nurse from a Nochris or a Tamei animal. We are not concerned that he suckles something detestable and forbidden;</p>
<p class="bas indent2"><span class="nm">1.</span>One may not <i>feed</i> to a child Neveilah, Treifah, Tamei rodents or vermin;</p>
<p class="bas indent2"><span class="nm">2.</span>The child may nurse from them even on Shabbos. An adult may not;</p>
<p class="bas indent2"><span class="nm">3.</span>Aba Sha'ul says, we used to nurse from Tahor animals on Yom Tov.</p>
<p class="bas indent2"><span class="nm">4.</span><span class="cl">Conclusion:</span> The Beraisa says that we are not concerned that he suckles Isur!</p>
<p class="bas indent1"><span class="nm">(p)</span><span class="cl">Rejection:</span> It is permitted because the child is in danger if he does not nurse.</p>
<p class="bas indent1"><span class="nm">(q)</span><span class="cl">Question:</span> If so, it should be permitted even for an adult!</p>
<p class="bas indent1"><span class="nm">(r)</span><span class="cl">Answer:</span> An adult is forbidden until we assess that he is in danger.</p>
<p class="bas indent1"><span class="nm">(s)</span><span class="cl">Question:</span> A child should also need an assessment!</p>
<p class="bas indent1"><span class="nm">(t)</span><span class="cl">Answer (Rav Huna brei d'Rav Yehoshua):</span> We assume that a child is in danger if he lacks milk.</p>
<p class="bas subject"><span class="nm">2)</span>DIRECTLY GIVING <i>ISUR</i> TO A CHILD</p>
<p class="bas indent1"><span class="nm">(a)</span><span class="cl">(Beraisa - Aba Sha'ul):</span> We used to nurse from Tahor animals on Yom Tov.</p>
<p class="bas indent1"><span class="nm">(b)</span><span class="cl">Question:</span> What is the case?</p>
<p class="bas indent2"><span class="nm">1.</span>If there is a danger, it should be permitted even on Shabbos!</p>
<p class="bas indent2"><span class="nm">2.</span>If there is no danger, it should be forbidden even on Yom Tov!</p>
<p class="bas indent1"><span class="nm">(c)</span><span class="cl">Answer:</span> The case is, they were in pain. He holds that nursing is Mefarek (extracting) in an unskillful manner, which is forbidden only mid'Rabanan.</p>
<p class="bas indent2"><span class="nm">1.</span>On Shabbos one (who is Mefarek normally) is liable to stoning, therefore Chachamim decreed (against unskillful Mefarek, e.g. nursing, even though he is in pain);</p>
<p class="bas indent2"><span class="nm">2.</span>Skilled Melachah on Yom Tov is only a Lav, so they did not decree to forbid one in pain.</p>
<p class="bas indent1"><span class="nm">(d)</span><span class="cl">Question (Beraisa):</span> "Lo Tochlum (do not eat Sheratzim)" - we read this 'Lo Ta'achilum (do not feed them)', to warn adults about minors.</p>

<p class="bas indent1"><span class="nm">(e)</span><span class="cl">Answer:</span> No, this forbids giving them to minors to eat.</p>
<p class="bas indent1"><span class="nm">(f)</span><span class="cl">Question (Beraisa):</span> "Every soul among you will not eat blood" warns adults about minors.</p>

<p class="bas indent1"><span class="nm">(h)</span><span class="cl">Question (Beraisa):</span> It says "Emor" and "v'Omarta" (before the Lav for Kohanim to become Tamei), to warn adults about minors.</p>

<p class="bas indent1"><span class="nm">(i)</span><span class="cl">Answer:</span> No, this forbids making them Tamei.</p>

<p class="bas bbbline">114b----------------------------------------114b</p>
<p class="bas indent2"><span class="nm">1.</span>Had the Torah taught only about Sheratzim, one might have thought that this is because the Isur applies to any amount (if it is a full creature - Tosfos), but adults may feed blood to minors, for the Shi'ur (to be liable) for blood is a Revi'is;</p>
<p class="bas indent2"><span class="nm">2.</span>Had the Torah taught only regarding blood, one might have thought that this is because there is Kares for eating blood; but adults may feed Sheratzim to minors.</p>
<p class="bas indent2"><span class="nm">3.</span>Had the Torah taught only these two, one might have thought that this is because the Isur applies to everyone; but since Tum'ah applies only to Kohanim, adults may make minors Tamei.</p>
<p class="bas indent2"><span class="nm">4.</span>Had the Torah taught only regarding Tum'ah, one might have thought this applies only there, since the Torah gave extra laws to Kohanim; but adults may give to minors Isurim that apply to everyone.</p>

<p class="bas indent1"><span class="nm">(l)</span><span class="cl">Answer:</span> He must divorce her because she is forbidden to him, and she is a Pikachas.</p>

<p class="bas indent1"><span class="nm">(p)</span><span class="cl">Answer (Rav Shemayah):</span> This is a decree lest people (who do not realize that they may stay married because they are exempt from Mitzvos) will think that their marriage dispels Zikah, and permit the Tzarah to marry a stranger.</p>

<p class="bas indent1"><span class="nm">(a)</span><span class="cl">(Mishnah):</span> A woman went with her husband overseas. They were at peace, and there was peace in the world. If she returned and said that her husband died, she may remarry, or do Yibum if he had no children;</p>
<p class="bas indent1"><span class="nm">(b)</span>If she was at peace with her husband, but there was war in the world, or she was quarreling with her husband and there was peace in the world, she is not believed to say that he died;</p>

<p class="bas indent2"><span class="nm">1.</span><span class="cl">Chachamim:</span> Whether or not she is crying and has torn clothes, she is believed.</p>
<p class="bas indent1"><span class="nm">(d)</span><span class="cl">(Gemara):</span> It says 'they were at peace' to exclude when they were quarreling. It says 'there was peace in the world' to exclude when there was war.</p>
