<p class="bas subject"><span class="nm">1)</span>TEMPORARY DAMAGE (cont.)</p>
<p class="bas indent1"><span class="nm">(a)</span><span class="cl">Answer #1 (Mishnah):</span> If one strikes his father or mother and does not make a wound, or strikes a person on Yom Kipur, he is liable for all damages.</p>
<p class="bas indent2"><span class="nm">1.</span><span class="cl">Question:</span> What is the case in which he does not make a wound?</p>
<p class="bas indent2"><span class="nm">2.</span><span class="cl">Answer:</span> He hit him on the hand, and later it will return to normal. The Mishnah obligates for all damages.</p>
<p class="bas indent1"><span class="nm">(b)</span><span class="cl">Rejection #1:</span> No. The case is, he deafened him without making a wound.</p>
<p class="bas indent1"><span class="nm">(c)</span><span class="cl">Objection:</span> Rabah taught that one who deafens his father is killed, for one cannot deafen someone without making a wound. Surely, a drop of blood fell into the ear!</p>
<p class="bas indent1"><span class="nm">(d)</span><span class="cl">Rejection #2:</span> No, the case is, he shaved him.</p>
<p class="bas indent1"><span class="nm">(e)</span><span class="cl">Question:</span> His hair will grow back. The damage is only temporary. We can still settle our question from the Mishnah!</p>
<p class="bas indent1"><span class="nm">(f)</span><span class="cl">Answer:</span> No, the case is, Reuven anointed Shimon with Nasa (a potion that permanently stops hair from growing).</p>
<p class="bas indent1"><span class="nm">(g)</span>The Mishnah obligates for all damages. We explain how all the other damages apply:</p>
<p class="bas indent2"><span class="nm">1.</span>Pain - he has sores in ridges on his head (and the potion aggravated them).</p>
<p class="bas indent2"><span class="nm">2.</span>Refu'ah - he must heal the sores;</p>
<p class="bas indent2"><span class="nm">3.</span>Sheves - he used to get paid for jesting, i.e. shaking his head while dancing, and the sores prevent him from doing so.</p>
<p class="bas indent2"><span class="nm">4.</span>Embarrassment - baldness is the ultimate embarrassment!</p>
<p class="bas indent1"><span class="nm">(h)</span>Abaye and Rava argued about the law that Rabah was unsure about.</p>
<p class="bas indent1"><span class="nm">(i)</span><span class="cl">(Abaye):</span> If Reuven hit Shimon on the hand, and later it will return to normal, he pays Nezek and Sheves;</p>
<p class="bas indent1"><span class="nm">(j)</span><span class="cl">(Rava):</span> He pays only Sheves.</p>
<p class="bas indent1"><span class="nm">(k)</span><span class="cl">(Abaye):</span> If Reuven cut off the hand of Shimon's (Yisrael) slave, he pays Nezek to the slave, and Sheves to Shimon;</p>
<p class="bas indent1"><span class="nm">(l)</span><span class="cl">(Rava):</span> The slave gets the entire payment. We buy land with the money, and Shimon gets the produce (until the slave goes free).</p>
<p class="bas indent1"><span class="nm">(m)</span>If the slave was damaged, and this affects only the slave, not the master, obviously, the slave gets the entire payment.</p>
<p class="bas indent2"><span class="nm">1.</span><span class="cl">Question:</span> What is the case?</p>
<p class="bas indent2"><span class="nm">2.</span><span class="cl">Answer:</span> He cut off the end of the ear or nostrils.</p>
<p class="bas indent1"><span class="nm">(n)</span>If the slave was damaged, and this affects only the master, but not the slave, Abaye and Rava argue about this (as above).</p>
<p class="bas subject"><span class="nm">2)</span>COMPENSATION FOR EMBARRASSMENT</p>
<p class="bas indent1"><span class="nm">(a)</span><span class="cl">(Mishnah):</span> We evaluate embarrassment according to the one who embarrassed and the one who was embarrassed.</p>
<p class="bas indent1"><span class="nm">(b)</span><span class="cl">Question:</span> Who is the Tana of the Mishnah?</p>
<p class="bas indent1"><span class="nm">(c)</span><span class="cl">Answer #1:</span>  Our Mishnah is like R. Shimon:</p>
<p class="bas indent2"><span class="nm">1.</span><span class="cl">(Beraisa - R. Meir):</span> Rich and poor people (who were embarrassed) are judged equally, as if they were rich people who lost their property, for all descend from Avraham, Yitzchak and Yakov.</p>
<p class="bas indent2"><span class="nm">2.</span>R. Yehudah says, a rich person is judged according to his wealth. A poor person is judged according to his poverty;</p>
<p class="bas indent2"><span class="nm">3.</span>R. Shimon says, a rich person is judged like a rich person who lost his property. A poor person is judged like the poorest man there is.</p>
<p class="bas indent3"><span class="nm">i.</span>Our Mishnah is unlike R. Meir, who says that rich and poor are judged equally;</p>
<p class="bas indent3"><span class="nm">ii.</span>Our Mishnah obligates for embarrassing a blind person. It is unlike R. Yehudah, who says that Boshes does not apply to a blind person.</p>
<p class="bas indent1"><span class="nm">(d)</span><span class="cl">Answer #2:</span> Our Mishnah is like R. Yehudah. He says that a blind person does not pay embarrassment, but he can receive it!</p>
<p class="bas indent1"><span class="nm">(e)</span><span class="cl">Objection (Reisha):</span> One who embarrasses a sleeping person is liable, but a sleeping person who embarrasses is exempt;</p>
<p class="bas indent2"><span class="nm">1.</span>It does not exempt a blind person who embarrasses. This implies that he can receive and pay for embarrassment!</p>
<p class="bas indent1"><span class="nm">(f)</span><span class="cl">Conclusion:</span> We must answer as Answer #1.</p>
<p class="bas indent1"><span class="nm">(g)</span><span class="cl">Question:</span> Who is the Tana of the following Beraisa?</p>
<p class="bas indent2"><span class="nm">1.</span><span class="cl">(Beraisa):</span> If one intended to embarrass a Katan (one of small wealth) and embarrassed a Gadol (rich person), he pays the Gadol what is proper for a Katan;</p>
<p class="bas indent2"><span class="nm">2.</span>If one intended to embarrass a slave and embarrassed a free person, he pays the free person what is proper for embarrassing a slave</p>
<p class="bas indent2"><span class="nm">3.</span><span class="cl">Summation of question:</span> This is not like R. Meir, R. Yehudah or R. Shimon!</p>
<p class="bas indent3"><span class="nm">i.</span>It is not like R. Meir. He judges rich and poor people equally!</p>
<p class="bas indent3"><span class="nm">ii.</span>It is not like R. Yehudah, who says that Boshes does not apply to a blind person.</p>
<p class="bas indent3"><span class="nm">iii.</span>It is not like R. Shimon. He holds that one who intended to embarrass Reuven and embarrassed Shimon is exempt!</p>
<p class="bas indent3"><span class="nm">iv.</span><span class="cl">Question:</span> What is R. Shimon's reason?</p>
<p class="bas indent3"><span class="nm">v.</span><span class="cl">Answer:</span> He learns from murder. One who intended to kill Reuven and killed Shimon is exempt - "he waited in ambush for him and rose against him." He is liable only if he intended for his victim;</p>
<p class="bas indent3"><span class="nm">vi.</span>The same applies to embarrassment - "she sent her hand and grabbed his shameful place" - she is liable only if she intended for him.</p>
<p class="bas indent1"><span class="nm">(h)</span><span class="cl">Answer #1:</span> Really, the Beraisa is like R. Yehudah. He says that a slave does not receive (payment for) embarrassment, but we can evaluate how much he would want to receive to suffer such an indignity (and this is paid to the free person who was embarrassed).</p>
<p class="bas indent1"><span class="nm">(i)</span><span class="cl">Answer #2:</span> Really, it is like R. Meir. 'Katan' refers to a minor, and Gadol refers to an adult.</p>
<p class="bas indent1"><span class="nm">(j)</span><span class="cl">Question:</span> Do minors really suffer (and therefore receive) embarrassment?!</p>
<p class="bas indent1"><span class="nm">(k)</span><span class="cl">Answer:</span> Yes, like Rav Papa taught (elsewhere).</p>
<p class="bas indent2"><span class="nm">1.</span><span class="cl">(Rav Papa):</span> When people mention the embarrassment and shame him, he is pained</p>

<p class="bas subject"><span class="nm">3)</span>SPECIAL CASES</p>
<p class="bas indent1"><span class="nm">(a)</span><span class="cl">(Mishnah):</span> One is liable for embarrassing a blind, naked or sleeping person;</p>
<p class="bas indent2"><span class="nm">1.</span>A sleeping person who embarrassed someone is exempt.</p>
<p class="bas indent1"><span class="nm">(b)</span>If Reuven fell from the roof and damaged and embarrassed, he is liable for the damage and exempt for the embarrassment, unless he intended to embarrass.</p>
<p class="bas indent1"><span class="nm">(c)</span><span class="cl">(Gemara - Beraisa):</span> Reuven embarrassed Shimon when Shimon was naked (or in the bathhouse), Reuven is liable, but not as much as one who embarrasses a clothed person (or in the market).</p>
<p class="bas indent1"><span class="nm">(d)</span><span class="cl">Question:</span> Does a naked person really feel embarrassment?!</p>
<p class="bas indent1"><span class="nm">(e)</span><span class="cl">Answer (Rav Papa):</span> The case is, a wind lifted up Shimon's garment. Reuven lifted it higher (exposing more of Shimon).</p>
<p class="bas indent1"><span class="nm">(f)</span><span class="cl">Question:</span> Does one really feel embarrassment in the bathhouse? (Everyone is naked there!)</p>
<p class="bas indent1"><span class="nm">(g)</span><span class="cl">Answer (Rav Papa):</span> He embarrassed him by the riverbank.</p>
<p class="bas indent1"><span class="nm">(h)</span><span class="cl">Question (R. Aba bar Mamal):</span> If Reuven embarrassed Shimon when Shimon was sleeping; and Shimon (never woke up and) died, what is the law?</p>
<p class="bas indent2"><span class="nm">1.</span><span class="cl">Question:</span> What is the basis of the question?</p>
<p class="bas indent2"><span class="nm">2.</span><span class="cl">Understanding #1 (Rav Zvid):</span> If one pays because the victim feels shame, if so, (since Shimon never found out,) Reuven is exempt;</p>
<p class="bas indent2"><span class="nm">3.</span>If one pays because he disgraced the victim, Reuven is liable.</p>
<p class="bas indent1"><span class="nm">(i)</span><span class="cl">Answer (Beraisa - R. Meir):</span> A Cheresh (deaf-mute) or child receives payment for embarrassment. A lunatic does not.</p>
<p class="bas indent2"><span class="nm">1.</span>If one pays due to disgrace, this explains why a child collects;</p>
<p class="bas indent2"><span class="nm">2.</span><span class="cl">Question:</span> But if it is because the victim feels shame, a child does not feel shame!</p>

<p class="bas indent2"><span class="nm">4.</span><span class="cl">Answer:</span> Being a lunatic is the greatest disgrace. He cannot be disgraced more.</p>
<p class="bas indent2"><span class="nm">5.</span><span class="cl">Suggestion:</span> The original answer remains. Since a child collects, this shows that one pays for the disgrace.</p>
<p class="bas indent1"><span class="nm">(j)</span><span class="cl">Rejection:</span> A child suffers shame like Rav Papa taught;</p>
<p class="bas indent2"><span class="nm">1.</span><span class="cl">(Rav Papa):</span> When people mention the embarrassment and shame him, he is pained.</p>

<p class="bas subject"><span class="nm">4)</span>A BLIND PERSON WHO EMBARRASSES ANOTHER PERSON</p>
<p class="bas indent1"><span class="nm">(a)</span><span class="cl">(Mishnah):</span> One who embarrasses a blind person...</p>
<p class="bas indent1"><span class="nm">(b)</span>The Mishnah (does not exempt a blind person who embarrasses. This) is unlike R. Yehudah.</p>
<p class="bas indent2"><span class="nm">1.</span><span class="cl">(Beraisa #1 - R. Yehudah):</span> A blind person does not pay for embarrassment. Also, he is exempt from exile, lashes and capital punishment.</p>
<p class="bas indent2"><span class="nm">2.</span><span class="cl">Question:</span> What is R. Yehudah's reason?</p>
<p class="bas indent2"><span class="nm">3.</span><span class="cl">Answer - part 1 (regarding embarrassment):</span> He learns a Gezeirah Shavah "Einecha-Einecha" from Zomemim witnesses.</p>
<p class="bas indent3"><span class="nm">i.</span>Just like a blind person never pays for being an Ed Zomem (since he cannot be a witness), he never pays for embarrassment.</p>
