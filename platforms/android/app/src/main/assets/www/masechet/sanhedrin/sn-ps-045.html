<p class="bas subject"><span class="nm">1)</span>WHO IS STONED NAKED?</p>
<p class="bas indent1"><span class="nm">(a)</span><span class="cl">(Mishnah):</span> When he is four Amos from Beis ha'Skilah (the place where people are stoned), they remove his garments;</p>
<p class="bas indent2"><span class="nm">1.</span>R. Yehudah says, we cover a man's genitals in front, and we cover a woman in front and in back;</p>
<p class="bas indent2"><span class="nm">2.</span>Chachamim say, only a man is stoned (virtually) naked, and not a woman.</p>
<p class="bas indent1"><span class="nm">(b)</span><span class="cl">(Gemara - Beraisa - R. Yehudah):</span> A man is covered in one place in front, a woman is covered in two places, in front and in back, because her genitals are visible from both sides.</p>
<p class="bas indent1"><span class="nm">(c)</span>Chachamim say, a man is stoned naked, and not a woman.</p>
<p class="bas indent1"><span class="nm">(d)</span><span class="cl">Question:</span> What is Chachamim's reason?</p>
<p class="bas indent1"><span class="nm">(e)</span><span class="cl">Answer - Question:</span> What do we learn from "va'Yirgemu Oso"?</p>
<p class="bas indent2"><span class="nm">1.</span><span class="cl">Suggestion:</span> We stone "Oso" (a man), but not a woman.</p>
<p class="bas indent2"><span class="nm">2.</span><span class="cl">Rejection:</span> "V'Hotzeisa Es ha'Ish ha'Hu Oh Es ha'Ishah."</p>
<p class="bas indent1"><span class="nm">(f)</span><span class="cl">Answer:</span> A man is stoned without his garment, but a woman is not.</p>
<p class="bas indent1"><span class="nm">(g)</span>R. Yehudah says, "Oso" - only he is stoned, and not his garment. The same applies to a woman.</p>
<p class="bas indent1"><span class="nm">(h)</span><span class="cl">Inference:</span> Chachamim are concerned lest onlookers be aroused to lust if they see her naked, and R. Yehudah is not concerned.</p>
<p class="bas indent1"><span class="nm">(i)</span><span class="cl">Contradiction:</span> Elsewhere, they hold just the contrary!</p>
<p class="bas indent2"><span class="nm">1.</span><span class="cl">(Mishnah):</span> The Kohen holds the garments of the Sotah. We are not concerned if they tear. He uncovers her heart, and unties the braids of her hair;</p>
<p class="bas indent2"><span class="nm">2.</span>R. Yehudah says, if she was attractive in these areas he does not uncover or untie.</p>
<p class="bas indent1"><span class="nm">(j)</span><span class="cl">Answer - part 1 (Rabah):</span> There, R. Yehudah is concerned lest she live, and young Kohanim will desire her. Here, she has already been sentenced to die.</p>
<p class="bas indent2"><span class="nm">1.</span><span class="cl">Suggestion:</span> Perhaps seeing her naked will arouse desire for other women!</p>
<p class="bas indent2"><span class="nm">2.</span><span class="cl">Rejection:</span> Rabah taught that we have a tradition, that the evil inclination desires only what a person saw.</p>
<p class="bas indent1"><span class="nm">(k)</span><span class="cl">Answer - part 2 (Rava):</span> Chachamim always require the Kohen to expose a Sotah, to fulfill "v'Nivasru Kol ha'Nashim" (all the women will be chastised);</p>
<p class="bas indent2"><span class="nm">1.</span>Seeing a person stoned is the greatest deterrent, even if he or she is clothed.</p>
<p class="bas indent1"><span class="nm">(l)</span><span class="cl">Question:</span> Perhaps we should stone her naked for additional deterrent!</p>
<p class="bas indent1"><span class="nm">(m)</span><span class="cl">Answer #1 (Rav Nachman):</span> "V'Ohavta l'Re'acha Kamocha" - choose a nice death for him.</p>
<p class="bas indent2"><span class="nm">1.</span><span class="cl">Suggestion:</span> Rav Nachman's law is like Chachamim, R. Yehudah argues with it.</p>
<p class="bas indent1"><span class="nm">(n)</span><span class="cl">Rejection (and Answer #2):</span> Also R. Yehudah agrees with Rav Nachman's law;</p>
<p class="bas indent2"><span class="nm">1.</span>R. Yehudah holds that a woman is more concerned for her disgrace, so she prefers to be stoned clothed. Chachamim say that she is more concerned for her pain, so she prefers to be stoned naked, so she will die faster.</p>
<p class="bas subject"><span class="nm">2)</span>HOW STONING IS DONE</p>
<p class="bas indent1"><span class="nm">(a)</span><span class="cl">(Mishnah):</span> Beis ha'Skilah was twice a person's height. One of the witnesses would push him from his back;</p>
<p class="bas indent2"><span class="nm">1.</span>If he fell face down, they would turn him on his side.</p>
<p class="bas indent1"><span class="nm">(b)</span>If he died from the fall, the Mitzvah was fulfilled. If not, the other witness takes a rock and drops it on his heart.</p>
<p class="bas indent1"><span class="nm">(c)</span>If he died from this, the Mitzvah was fulfilled. If not, everyone stones him - "Yad ha'Edim Tihyeh Bo va'Rishonah Lahamiso v'Yad Kol ha'Am ba'Acharonah"</p>
<p class="bas indent1"><span class="nm">(d)</span><span class="cl">(Gemara - Beraisa):</span> Since he is pushed from a standing position, he falls three times his height.</p>
<p class="bas indent1"><span class="nm">(e)</span><span class="cl">Question:</span> Is such a fall necessary to kill a person?!</p>
<p class="bas indent2"><span class="nm">1.</span><span class="cl">Contradiction (Mishnah):</span> A pit of 10 Tefachim (almost a meter) can kill. (Less than this, we do not attribute death to the fall).</p>
<p class="bas indent1"><span class="nm">(f)</span><span class="cl">Answer (Rav Nachman):</span> "V'Ohavta l'Re'acha Kamocha" - choose a nice death for him. (A higher fall causes him to die quickly, with less pain.)</p>
<p class="bas indent1"><span class="nm">(g)</span><span class="cl">Question:</span> If so, we should make it even higher, and he will die even sooner!</p>
<p class="bas indent1"><span class="nm">(h)</span><span class="cl">Answer:</span> If so, his limbs would fall off. This would be disgraceful.</p>
<p class="bas indent1"><span class="nm">(i)</span><span class="cl">(Mishnah):</span> One of the witnesses would push him...</p>
<p class="bas indent1"><span class="nm">(j)</span><span class="cl">(Beraisa) Question:</span> What is the source to push him?</p>
<p class="bas indent1"><span class="nm">(k)</span><span class="cl">Answer:</span> "Yaro" (he will be cast down).</p>
<p class="bas indent1"><span class="nm">(l)</span><span class="cl">Question:</span> What is the source to stone him?</p>
<p class="bas indent1"><span class="nm">(m)</span><span class="cl">Answer:</span> "Sakol".</p>
<p class="bas indent1"><span class="nm">(n)</span><span class="cl">Question:</span> What is the source that if he died from the fall, the Mitzvah was fulfilled?</p>
<p class="bas indent1"><span class="nm">(o)</span><span class="cl">Answer:</span> "Sakol Yisakel Oh Yaro Yiyareh."</p>
<p class="bas indent1"><span class="nm">(p)</span><span class="cl">Question:</span> (That verse discusses one who would ascend Har Sinai at the time of Matan Torah.) What is the source for all generations?</p>
<p class="bas bbbline">45b----------------------------------------45b</p>
<p class="bas indent1"><span class="nm">(q)</span><span class="cl">Answer:</span> "Sakol <i>Yisakel</i>" (is the future tense).</p>
<p class="bas subject"><span class="nm">3)</span>THE ROCK</p>
<p class="bas indent1"><span class="nm">(a)</span><span class="cl">(Mishnah):</span> If not, the other witness takes a rock and puts it on his heart.</p>
<p class="bas indent1"><span class="nm">(b)</span><span class="cl">Question:</span> The rock was too heavy for the other witness to take it by himself!</p>
<p class="bas indent2"><span class="nm">1.</span><span class="cl">(Beraisa - R. Shimon ben Elazar):</span> There was a rock, so heavy that two men were needed to lift it. He takes it and puts it on his heart. If he died from this, the Mitzvah was fulfilled.</p>
<p class="bas indent2"><span class="nm">2.</span><span class="cl">Question:</span> The same question applies to the Beraisa. How can one witness take a rock that requires two men to lift it?</p>
<p class="bas indent1"><span class="nm">(c)</span><span class="cl">Answer (to both questions):</span> The first witness helps him to lift it. The second witness throws it himself, so it will go forcefully.</p>
<p class="bas indent1"><span class="nm">(d)</span><span class="cl">(Mishnah):</span> If not, everyone stones him.</p>
<p class="bas indent1"><span class="nm">(e)</span><span class="cl">Question (Beraisa):</span> A person never survived the first rock.</p>
<p class="bas indent1"><span class="nm">(f)</span><span class="cl">Answer:</span> The Mishnah did not say that this sometimes happened. It just says that if this was necessary, it would be done.</p>
<p class="bas indent1"><span class="nm">(g)</span><span class="cl">(Beraisa - R. Shimon ben Elazar):</span> There was a rock...(this implies that the same rock was always used).</p>
<p class="bas indent1"><span class="nm">(h)</span><span class="cl">Question (Beraisa):</span> The following are buried with the executed person: the rock used to kill him, the wood he was hung from, the sword he was killed with, or the cloth he was choked with.</p>
<p class="bas indent1"><span class="nm">(i)</span><span class="cl">Answer:</span> After burying it with him, a new stone was prepared.</p>
<p class="bas indent1"><span class="nm">(j)</span><span class="cl">Contradiction (Beraisa):</span> They are not buried with him!</p>
<p class="bas indent1"><span class="nm">(k)</span><span class="cl">Answer (Rav Papa):</span> They are buried in his area (within four Amos)..</p>
<p class="bas subject"><span class="nm">4)</span>IF WE CANNOT FULFILL EVERYTHING, DOES THE PARSHAH STILL APPLY?</p>
<p class="bas indent1"><span class="nm">(a)</span><span class="cl">(Shmuel):</span> If the witnesses' hands were cut off, the defendant is not stoned.</p>
<p class="bas indent1"><span class="nm">(b)</span><span class="cl">Question:</span> What is the reason?</p>
<p class="bas indent1"><span class="nm">(c)</span><span class="cl">Answer:</span> Since we cannot fulfill "Yad ha'Edim Tihyeh Bo va'Rishonah", we do not stone.</p>
<p class="bas indent1"><span class="nm">(d)</span><span class="cl">Question:</span> If so, witnesses without hands should be invalid from the beginning!</p>
<p class="bas indent1"><span class="nm">(e)</span><span class="cl">Answer:</span> "Yad ha'Edim" refers to hands that they had from the beginning. Then, those hands must kill him.</p>
<p class="bas indent1"><span class="nm">(f)</span><span class="cl">Question (Mishnah):</span> If two witnesses will say (anywhere) 'we testify that Reuven was sentenced to Misah in Beis Din Ploni. The witnesses were David and Meir,' we kill Reuven (even though David and Meir are not here to kill him)!</p>
<p class="bas indent1"><span class="nm">(g)</span><span class="cl">Answer (Shmuel):</span> No, that is when David and Meir themselves testify now (that Reuven was sentenced due to their testimony in Beis Din Ploni. They themselves will kill him).</p>
<p class="bas indent1"><span class="nm">(h)</span><span class="cl">Question:</span> Is it really true that if we cannot fulfill everything in the verse, the whole Parshah does not apply?!</p>
<p class="bas indent2"><span class="nm">1.</span><span class="cl">Question:</span> Perhaps "Mos Yumas ha'Makeh Rotze'ach Hu" teaches that we can give only the Misah that a murderer deserves;</p>
<p class="bas indent3"><span class="nm">i.</span>What is the source to kill him any other way if we cannot give the proper Misah?</p>
<p class="bas indent2"><span class="nm">2.</span><span class="cl">Answer:</span> "Mos Yumas ha'Makeh" - the verb is doubled to teach this.</p>
<p class="bas indent1"><span class="nm">(i)</span><span class="cl">Answer:</span> That is an exception. It was expounded from the verse.</p>
<p class="bas indent1"><span class="nm">(j)</span><span class="cl">Question:</span> We should learn from it to other places (that even if we cannot fulfill everything in the verse, the Parshah still applies)!</p>
<p class="bas indent1"><span class="nm">(k)</span><span class="cl">Answer:</span> Execution of a murderer, and Go'el ha'Dam (the relative of one who was killed. He may kill Ploni (who killed his relative) in any way. If Ploni killed b'Shogeg, he may be killed only outside his Ir Miklat, i.e. refuge city) are two verses teaching this principle (and we could have learned one of them from the other). In all such cases, the two verses do not teach about other laws.</p>
<p class="bas indent1"><span class="nm">(l)</span><span class="cl">Question:</span> What is the verse of Go'el ha'Dam?</p>
<p class="bas indent1"><span class="nm">(m)</span><span class="cl">Answer (Beraisa):</span> "Go'el ha'Dam Yamis Es ha'Rotze'ach" - it is a Mitzvah for him to kill the murderer.</p>
<p class="bas indent2"><span class="nm">1.</span><span class="cl">Question:</span> What is the source that if there is no Go'el ha'Dam, Beis Din appoints one (Rashi - to kill a Shogeg murderer outside his Ir Miklat; R. Chananel - anyone who finds him should kill him; Me'iri - to strive to bring a Mezid murderer to Beis Din)?</p>
<p class="bas indent2"><span class="nm">2.</span><span class="cl">Answer:</span> "B'Fig'o Vo" - in any case (someone should kill him).</p>
<p class="bas indent1"><span class="nm">(n)</span><span class="cl">Question (Mar Kashisha brei d'Rav Chisda):</span> All should agree that if we cannot fulfill everything in the verse, the Parshah does not apply!</p>
<p class="bas indent2"><span class="nm">1.</span><span class="cl">(Mishnah):</span> A Ben Sorer u'Moreh (a son who steals from his parents to eat meat and drink wine) is not killed if one of his parents lacks hands, or is mute, lame, blind, or deaf:</p>
<p class="bas indent2"><span class="nm">2.</span>"V'Sofsu Vo" - they must have hands;</p>
<p class="bas indent2"><span class="nm">3.</span>"V'Hotzi'u Oso" - they cannot be lame;</p>
<p class="bas indent2"><span class="nm">4.</span>"V'Omru" - they cannot be mute;</p>
<p class="bas indent2"><span class="nm">5.</span>"Beneinu Zeh" - they cannot be blind;</p>
<p class="bas indent2"><span class="nm">6.</span>"Einenu Shome'a b'Koleinu" - they cannot be deaf (they must be able to perceive that he did not accept their words).</p>
<p class="bas indent2"><span class="nm">7.</span><span class="cl">Suggestion:</span> These requirements are because (always) if we cannot fulfill everything in the verse, the Parshah does not apply!</p>
<p class="bas indent1"><span class="nm">(o)</span><span class="cl">Answer (Rav Ashi):</span> No. Each of those is extra to teach that it is Me'akev.</p>
<p class="bas indent1"><span class="nm">(p)</span><span class="cl">Support (for Shmuel - Beraisa - R. Yishmael):</span> If a city (in which most of the people served idolatry) does not have a street, it cannot become an Ir ha'Nidachas;</p>
<p class="bas indent2"><span class="nm">1.</span>R. Akiva says, if it has no street, we build a street.</p>
<p class="bas indent2"><span class="nm">2.</span>They argue only whether or not the street must be there from the beginning, but all agree that we must have a street (in which to gather everything)!</p>
<p class="bas indent1"><span class="nm">(q)</span><span class="cl">Conclusion:</span> Tana'im argue about this principle.</p>
<p class="bas indent2"><span class="nm">1.</span><span class="cl">(Mishnah):</span> If a Metzora does not have a right thumb, big toe or ear (on which the blood of the Asham and oil must be put), he can never become Tahor;</p>
<p class="bas indent2"><span class="nm">2.</span>R. Eliezer says, it suffices to put it in the place of the missing limb.</p>
<p class="bas indent2"><span class="nm">3.</span>R. Shimon says, it suffices to put it on the left thumb, toe or ear.</p>
<p class="bas subject"><span class="nm">5)</span>WHO IS HANGED?</p>
<p class="bas indent1"><span class="nm">(a)</span><span class="cl">(Mishnah - R. Eliezer):</span> Everyone who is stoned is hung;</p>
<p class="bas indent1"><span class="nm">(b)</span>Chachamim say, only a blasphemer or idolater is hung.</p>
<p class="bas indent1"><span class="nm">(c)</span>R. Eliezer says, we hang a man facing the people. We hang a woman facing the beam;</p>
<p class="bas indent1"><span class="nm">(d)</span>Chachamim say, we hang only men, but not women.</p>
<p class="bas indent2"><span class="nm">1.</span><span class="cl">R. Eliezer:</span> Shimon ben Shetach hung women in Ashkelon!</p>
<p class="bas indent2"><span class="nm">2.</span><span class="cl">Chachamim:</span> He hung 80 in one day, even though we do not judge two capital cases in one day (it was due to an urgent need. It was not according to Halachah).</p>
<p class="bas indent1"><span class="nm">(e)</span><span class="cl">(Gemara - Beraisa - R. Eliezer) Suggestion:</span> Perhaps "v'Humas v'Salisa" teaches that everyone killed is hung!</p>
<p class="bas indent1"><span class="nm">(f)</span><span class="cl">Rejection:</span> "Ki Kilelas Elokim Taluy" - just like a blasphemer is stoned, and we hang him, also we hang everyone who is stoned.</p>
<p class="bas indent1"><span class="nm">(g)</span>Chachamim say, just like a blasphemer is Kofer b'Ikar (brazenly defies Hash-m) and is hung, also anyone who is Kofer b'Ikar (i.e. an idolater).</p>
