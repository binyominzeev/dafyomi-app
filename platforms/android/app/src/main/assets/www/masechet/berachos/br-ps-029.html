<p class="bas subject"><span class="nm">1)</span>BIRKAS HA'MINIM</p>
<p class="bas indent1"><span class="nm">(a)</span><span class="cl">(Beraisa):</span> Shimon ha'Pekuli arranged the 18 blessings of Shemoneh Esreh in front of R. Gamliel in Yavneh;</p>
<p class="bas indent2"><span class="nm">1.</span><span class="cl">R. Gamliel:</span> Does anyone know how to enact a blessing against heretics?</p>
<p class="bas indent2"><span class="nm">2.</span>Shmuel ha'Katan enacted it; the next year, he [was leading the prayer and] forgot it; he spent two or three hours trying to remember it, they did not replace him.</p>
<p class="bas indent1"><span class="nm">(b)</span><span class="cl">Question:</span> Why didn't they replace him?</p>
<p class="bas indent2"><span class="nm">1.</span><span class="cl">(Rav Yehudah):</span> If a Shali'ach Tzibur erred in any Berachah, we do not replace him, except for Birkas ha'Tzedukim, for we suspect he is a heretic (and therefore refuses to say it).</p>
<p class="bas indent1"><span class="nm">(c)</span><span class="cl">Answer:</span> Since Shmuel ha'Katan himself enacted the blessing, we do not suspect him.</p>
<p class="bas indent1"><span class="nm">(d)</span><span class="cl">Question:</span> Perhaps he retracted (and became a heretic)!</p>
<p class="bas indent1"><span class="nm">(e)</span><span class="cl">(Abaye):</span> We have a tradition, a Tzadik will not become a Rasha.</p>
<p class="bas indent1"><span class="nm">(f)</span><span class="cl">Question:</span> But it says, "uv'Shuv Tzadik mi'Tzidkaso v'Asah Avel..."!</p>
<p class="bas indent1"><span class="nm">(g)</span><span class="cl">Answer:</span> That refers to one who originally was a Rasha, it would not happen to one who was a Tzadik from the beginning.</p>
<p class="bas indent1"><span class="nm">(h)</span><span class="cl">Question (Mishnah):</span> Do not trust in yourself (that you will remain righteous) until you die!</p>
<p class="bas indent2"><span class="nm">1.</span>Yochanan Kohen Gadol served for 80 years (even though almost every other Kohen Gadol in Bayis Sheni did not merit to live to serve a second year), and he became a Tzeduki in the end!</p>
<p class="bas indent2"><span class="nm">2.</span><span class="cl">(Abaye):</span> Yanai ha'Melech (who killed almost all the Chachamim) was Yochanan Kohen Gadol.</p>
<p class="bas indent2"><span class="nm">3.</span><span class="cl">(Rava):</span> They are different -- Yanai was a Rasha from the beginning, Yochanan was initially a Tzadik.</p>
<p class="bas indent2"><span class="nm">4.</span>This is not difficult for Abaye (he can say that Yochanan was a Rasha from the beginning), but how can Rava answer?</p>
<p class="bas indent1"><span class="nm">(i)</span><span class="cl">Answer (for Rava):</span> Even one who was initially a Tzadik can turn bad.</p>
<p class="bas indent1"><span class="nm">(j)</span><span class="cl">Question:</span> If so, why didn't they replace Shimon ha'Tzadik?</p>
<p class="bas indent1"><span class="nm">(k)</span><span class="cl">Answer:</span> He had started the blessing;</p>
<p class="bas indent2"><span class="nm">1.</span><span class="cl">(Rav Yehudah):</span> If a Shali'ach Tzibur does not begin Birkas ha'Tzedukim we replace him, but if he started it (and erred), we allow him to finish.</p>
<p class="bas indent1"><span class="nm">(l)</span><span class="cl">Question:</span> To what do the seven blessings in the Shemoneh Esreh of Shabbos correspond?</p>
<p class="bas indent1"><span class="nm">(m)</span><span class="cl">Answer (R. Chalifta ben Shaul):</span> They correspond to the seven "voices of Hash-m on the water" (mentioned in Tehilim 29).</p>
<p class="bas indent1"><span class="nm">(n)</span><span class="cl">Question:</span> To what do the nine blessings in Musaf of Rosh Hashanah correspond?</p>
<p class="bas indent1"><span class="nm">(o)</span><span class="cl">Answer (R. Yitzchak of Kartignin):</span> They correspond to the nine mentions of Hash-m's name in Chanah's prayer.</p>
<p class="bas indent2"><span class="nm">1.</span>Pregnancy was decreed for Sarah, Rachel and Chanah on Rosh Hashanah. (From the text of the "u'Nesaneh Tokef" prayer, it seems that <i>every</i> pregnancy is decreed on Rosh Hashanah! Perhaps, since most people are Beinonim, the decree is not final until Yom Kipur, but for these righteous women, pregnancy was decreed <i>and sealed</i> on Rosh Hashanah.)</p>
<p class="bas indent1"><span class="nm">(p)</span><span class="cl">Question:</span> On a public fast day [six blessings are added to the Shemoneh Esreh,] to what do the 24 blessings correspond?</p>
<p class="bas indent1"><span class="nm">(q)</span><span class="cl">Answer (R. Chelbo):</span> They correspond to the 24 prayers that Shlomo said when he brought the Aron into the Kodesh ha'Kodashim.</p>
<p class="bas indent1"><span class="nm">(r)</span><span class="cl">Question:</span> If so, we should say 24 blessings every day!</p>
<p class="bas indent1"><span class="nm">(s)</span><span class="cl">Answer:</span> Shlomo said them on a day when mercy was needed (the gates did not want to let him enter), so we also say them on such days.</p>
<p class="bas subject"><span class="nm">2)</span>HAVINENU</p>
<p class="bas indent1"><span class="nm">(a)</span><span class="cl">(Mishnah - R. Yehoshua):</span> He may pray "like" Shemoneh Esreh.</p>
<p class="bas indent1"><span class="nm">(b)</span><span class="cl">Question:</span> What is this?</p>
<p class="bas indent1"><span class="nm">(c)</span><span class="cl">Answer #1 (Rav):</span> He says [18] abridged blessings;</p>
<p class="bas indent1"><span class="nm">(d)</span><span class="cl">Answer #2 (Shmuel):</span> He says [the first three and last three blessings as usual; the middle blessings are condensed into one long one:] "Havinenu (endow us with wisdom)... to know Your ways... Baruch Atah Hash-m Shome'a Tefilah."</p>
<p class="bas indent1"><span class="nm">(e)</span>Abaye cursed one who would pray Havinenu (unless he was travelling).</p>
<p class="bas indent1"><span class="nm">(f)</span><span class="cl">(Rav Nachman):</span> One may pray Havinenu any time of year, except for Motza'i Shabbos or Motza'i Yom Tov, for then one must say Havdalah in Chonen ha'Da'as (the fourth blessing, for understanding).</p>
<p class="bas indent1"><span class="nm">(g)</span><span class="cl">Question (Rabah bar Shmuel):</span> He should be able to say Havdalah by itself as the fourth blessing!</p>
<p class="bas indent2"><span class="nm">1.</span><span class="cl">(Mishnah - R. Akiva):</span> [On Motza'i Shabbos or Motza'i Yom Tov] Havdalah is a blessing by itself, the fourth blessing.</p>
<p class="bas indent2"><span class="nm">2.</span>R. Eliezer says, one says Havdalah in Modim.</p>
<p class="bas indent1"><span class="nm">(h)</span><span class="cl">Answer (Rav Nachman):</span> The Halachah does not follow R. Akiva (regarding a standard Shemoneh Esreh), therefore it is unreasonable that for Havinenu we should follow his opinion;</p>
<p class="bas indent2"><span class="nm">1.</span>The Halachah is unlike R. Akiva because the Anshei Keneses ha'Gedolah enacted 18 blessings, not 19 -- likewise, Havinenu was enacted with seven blessings, not eight!</p>
<p class="bas indent1"><span class="nm">(i)</span><span class="cl">Question (Mar Zutra):</span> One should be able to make Havdalah part of the long middle blessing of Havinenu [and say], "Havinenu Hash-m Elokeinu ha'Mavdil Bein Kodesh l'Chol"!</p>
<p class="bas indent1"><span class="nm">(j)</span>This is left difficult.</p>
<p class="bas indent1"><span class="nm">(k)</span><span class="cl">(Rav Bivi bar Abaye):</span> One may pray Havinenu any time of year, except for winter, for then one must request rain in Birkas ha'Shanim.</p>
<p class="bas indent1"><span class="nm">(l)</span><span class="cl">Question (Mar Zutra):</span> One should be able to request rain in Havinenu [and say], "Prosper us in Your land, and give us rain..."!</p>
<p class="bas indent1"><span class="nm">(m)</span><span class="cl">Answer:</span> A change from the standard text will confuse him (and make him forget the rest of the prayer).</p>
<p class="bas indent1"><span class="nm">(n)</span><span class="cl">Question:</span> If so, one should not say Havdalah in Chonen ha'Da'as, lest this confuse him!</p>
<p class="bas indent1"><span class="nm">(o)</span><span class="cl">Answer:</span> Havdalah is the beginning of the [requests of] Shemoneh Esreh, and thus it will not confuse him. We request rain in the middle of the requests, where a change will confuse him.</p>
<p class="bas indent1"><span class="nm">(p)</span><span class="cl">Question (Rav Ashi):</span> One should be able to request rain in Shome'a Tefilah (it is the end of the requests, there is no concern for confusion)!</p>
<p class="bas indent2"><span class="nm">1.</span><span class="cl">(R. Tanchum):</span> If one forgot to <i>mention</i> rain in Techiyas ha'Mesim (the second blessing), he must go back; if one forgot to <i>request</i> rain in Birkas ha'Shanim, he need not go back, for he may request it in Shome'a Tefilah.</p>
<p class="bas indent2"><span class="nm">2.</span>If one forgot to say Havdalah in Chonen ha'Da'as, he need not go back, for he can say it later over wine.</p>
<p class="bas indent1"><span class="nm">(q)</span><span class="cl">Answer:</span> That is only for one who forgot; l'Chatchilah we do not request rain in Shome'a Tefilah.</p>
<p class="bas subject"><span class="nm">3)</span>CORRECTING OMISSIONS</p>
<p class="bas indent1"><span class="nm">(a)</span><span class="cl">(R. Tanchum):</span> If one forgot... to <i>request</i> rain in Birkas ha'Shanim, he need not go back, for he may request it in Shome'a Tefilah.</p>
<p class="bas indent1"><span class="nm">(b)</span><span class="cl">Question (Beraisa):</span> If one forgot to mention rain in Techiyas ha'Mesim or to request rain in Birkas ha'Shanim, he must go back;</p>
<p class="bas indent2"><span class="nm">1.</span>If he forgot to say Havdalah in Chonen ha'Da'as, he need not go back, for he may say it later over wine.</p>
<p class="bas indent1"><span class="nm">(c)</span><span class="cl">Answer #1:</span> One who prays with a Minyan need not go back, one who prays alone must go back.</p>
<p class="bas indent1"><span class="nm">(d)</span><span class="cl">Objection:</span> Presumably, the distinction is that with a Minyan he need not go back because he will hear the request for rain from the Shali'ach Tzibur -- but R. Tanchum's reason was because he may request it in Shome'a Tefilah!</p>
<p class="bas indent1"><span class="nm">(e)</span><span class="cl">Answer #2:</span> Rather, R. Tanchum also discusses one who prays alone;</p>
<p class="bas indent1"><span class="nm">(f)</span>If one remembers (that he forgot to request rain) before Shome'a Tefilah he need not repeat Shemoneh Esreh, for he may request it in Shome'a Tefilah; if he remembers after Shome'a Tefilah, he must repeat Shemoneh Esreh.</p>
<p class="bas bbbline">29b----------------------------------------29b</p>
<p class="bas indent1"><span class="nm">(g)</span><span class="cl">(R. Tanchum citing R. Yehoshua ben Levi):</span> If one [realized that he] forgot to mention Rosh Chodesh (Ya'aleh v'Yavo) in Avodah (the blessing of Retzeh) and he is still in Avodah, he goes back to [the beginning of] Avodah;</p>
<p class="bas indent2"><span class="nm">1.</span>If he remembered his omission while saying Modim or Sim Shalom, he goes back to Avodah; if he already finished his prayer, he repeats Shemoneh Esreh.</p>
<p class="bas indent1"><span class="nm">(h)</span><span class="cl">(Rav Papa brei d'Rav Acha):</span> This law, that if he already finished his prayer he repeats Shemoneh Esreh, is only if he stepped back;</p>

<p class="bas indent1"><span class="nm">(i)</span><span class="cl">Question (R. Tanchum):</span> What is your source for this?</p>
<p class="bas indent1"><span class="nm">(j)</span><span class="cl">Answer (Rav Papa):</span> I heard this from my father, who heard it from Rav.</p>
<p class="bas indent1"><span class="nm">(k)</span><span class="cl">Version #1 (Rav Nachman bar Yitzchak):</span> This law, that if he already stepped back, he repeats Shemoneh Esreh, is only if he does not normally add supplications after Shemoneh Esreh;</p>
<p class="bas indent2"><span class="nm">1.</span>If he normally adds supplications after Shemoneh Esreh (it is as if he did not yet finish), he goes back to Avodah.</p>

<p class="bas indent1"><span class="nm">(c)</span><span class="cl">Answer #1 (R. Yakov bar Idi):</span> It is like a burden to him.</p>

<p class="bas indent1"><span class="nm">(e)</span><span class="cl">Answer #3 (Rabah and Rav Yosef):</span> He is unable to [concentrate to] request something new.</p>
<p class="bas indent2"><span class="nm">1.</span><span class="cl">R. Zeira:</span> I could request something new, but I fear lest I would get confused (and be unable to resume Shemoneh Esreh).</p>
<p class="bas indent1"><span class="nm">(f)</span><span class="cl">Answer #4 (Abaye and R. Chanina bar Avin):</span> This is one who does not pray (Shacharis and Minchah) Im Dimdumei Chamah (when the sun rises and sets).</p>
