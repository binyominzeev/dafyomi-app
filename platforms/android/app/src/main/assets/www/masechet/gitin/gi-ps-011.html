<p class="bas subject"><span class="nm">1)</span><i>NOCHRI</i> NAMES</p>
<p class="bas indent1"><span class="nm">(a)</span><span class="cl">Question:</span> What kinds of names are clearly of Nochrim?</p>
<p class="bas indent1"><span class="nm">(b)</span><span class="cl">Answer (Rav Papa):</span> Some examples are Hormiz, Avudaina bar Shivetai,...</p>
<p class="bas indent1"><span class="nm">(c)</span><span class="cl">Inference:</span> If the names could be of Yisre'elim, the Get is Pasul.</p>
<p class="bas indent1"><span class="nm">(d)</span><span class="cl">Question:</span> If so, why does the Reisha teach 'they are Pasul only when done by commoners'? Even if judges made the Get, we can distinguish!</p>
<p class="bas indent2"><span class="nm">1.</span>It is valid only if the judges' names are clearly of Nochrim. If not, it is Pasul!</p>
<p class="bas indent1"><span class="nm">(e)</span><span class="cl">Answer #1:</span> This is what the Mishnah means!</p>
<p class="bas indent2"><span class="nm">1.</span>It is valid only if the judges' names are clearly of Nochrim. If not, it is as if it was done by commoners, and it is Pasul.</p>
<p class="bas indent1"><span class="nm">(f)</span><span class="cl">Answer #2:</span> The Reisha refers to monetary documents.</p>
<p class="bas indent2"><span class="nm">1.</span>It teaches that monetary documents are Pasul only when done by commoners.</p>
<p class="bas indent1"><span class="nm">(g)</span><span class="cl">(Beraisa - R. Shimon):</span> R. Akiva and Chachamim agree that all documents made in Nochri courts are valid, even if Nochrim signed them, even Gitei Nashim or freedom;</p>
<p class="bas indent2"><span class="nm">1.</span>They argue only when they are done by commoners. R. Akiva says that they are valid. Chachamim disqualify them, except for Gitei Nashim or freedom. (All agree that these are valid, even if they were done by commoners.)</p>
<p class="bas indent2"><span class="nm">2.</span>R. Shimon ben Gamliel says, Gitei Nashim or freedom (signed by Nochri commoners) are valid only in places where Yisre'elim do not normally sign them.</p>
<p class="bas indent2"><span class="nm">3.</span><span class="cl">Question:</span> He should decree to disqualify them even where Yisre'elim do not normally sign them, due to places where Yisre'elim normally sign them!</p>
<p class="bas indent2"><span class="nm">4.</span><span class="cl">Answer:</span> In a place where Yisre'elim normally sign, if we would accept Gitin with clearly Nochri names, people would also accept Gitin with names that could be Yisre'elim (and they might rely on the signatures). People do not distinguish between the difference in names;</p>
<p class="bas indent3"><span class="nm">i.</span>We can accept Gitin (with names that are clearly of Nochrim) in places where Yisre'elim normally do not sign them, and people will not come to accept them in places where Yisre'elim normally sign them.</p>
<p class="bas subject"><span class="nm">2)</span>DOCUMENTS OF <i>NOCHRIM</i></p>
<p class="bas indent1"><span class="nm">(a)</span>Ravina was about to accept monetary documents made in gatherings of Nochrim.</p>
<p class="bas indent1"><span class="nm">(b)</span><span class="cl">Rafram:</span> The Mishnah accepts only those made in their courts.</p>
<p class="bas indent1"><span class="nm">(c)</span><span class="cl">(Rava):</span> A Persian document given in front of Yisrael witnesses may be used to collect from Bnei Chorin (the borrower's property, but not from what he sold).</p>
<p class="bas indent1"><span class="nm">(d)</span><span class="cl">Question:</span> The witnesses cannot read it!</p>
<p class="bas indent1"><span class="nm">(e)</span><span class="cl">Answer:</span> The case is, they can.</p>
<p class="bas indent1"><span class="nm">(f)</span><span class="cl">Question:</span> We require writing that cannot be (erased and) forged!</p>
<p class="bas indent1"><span class="nm">(g)</span><span class="cl">Answer:</span> The paper was treated with gall-nuts. (The writing cannot be erased).</p>
<p class="bas indent1"><span class="nm">(h)</span><span class="cl">Question:</span> The last line of the document must summarize the document!</p>
<p class="bas indent1"><span class="nm">(i)</span><span class="cl">Answer:</span> It does.</p>
<p class="bas indent1"><span class="nm">(j)</span><span class="cl">Question:</span> If so, one should be able to collect even from property that the borrower sold (after the loan)!</p>
<p class="bas indent1"><span class="nm">(k)</span><span class="cl">Answer:</span> People do not hear about such a document. (Buyers did not know about a lien on the land.)</p>
<p class="bas indent1"><span class="nm">(l)</span><span class="cl">Version #1 - Question (Reish Lakish):</span> If witnesses signed on a Get, and their names are Nochri names, what is the law?</p>
<p class="bas bbbline">11b----------------------------------------11b</p>
<p class="bas indent1"><span class="nm">(m)</span><span class="cl">Answer (R. Yochanan):</span> We had only one case, in which the names were Lukas and Luke. We accepted it.</p>
<p class="bas indent2"><span class="nm">1.</span>We accepted these names; but if (also) Yisre'elim often have such names, the Get would be Pasul.</p>
<p class="bas indent1"><span class="nm">(n)</span><span class="cl">Question (Beraisa):</span> Signed Gitin from abroad are valid, even though the witnesses' names are Nochri names, since most Yisre'elim in Chutz La'aretz have Nochri names.</p>
<p class="bas indent1"><span class="nm">(o)</span><span class="cl">Answer:</span> The Beraisa itself gives the reason, because most Yisre'elim in Chutz La'aretz have Nochri names!</p>
<p class="bas indent1"><span class="nm">(p)</span><span class="cl">Version #2 - Question (Reish Lakish):</span> What is the law of signed Gitin from abroad, on which the witnesses' names are Nochri names?</p>
<p class="bas indent1"><span class="nm">(q)</span><span class="cl">Answer (R. Yochanan - Beraisa):</span> They are valid, since most Yisre'elim in Chutz La'aretz have Nochri names.</p>
<p class="bas subject"><span class="nm">3)</span>ACQUIRING ON BEHALF OF OTHERS</p>
<p class="bas indent1"><span class="nm">(a)</span><span class="cl">(Mishnah - R. Meir):</span> If Reuven told a Shali'ach 'give this Get to my wife', or 'to my slave', in either case Reuven can retract;</p>
<p class="bas indent1"><span class="nm">(b)</span>Chachamim say, he can retract from a Get to his wife, but not from a Get to his slave;</p>
<p class="bas indent2"><span class="nm">1.</span>This is because we may do something beneficial for someone in his absence, but not something detrimental. (A Shali'ach can receive a Get on behalf of a slave, for freedom is beneficial, since one need not feed his slave. One cannot accept a Get for a woman, for divorce is detrimental, since one must feed his wife.)</p>
<p class="bas indent2"><span class="nm">2.</span><span class="cl">R. Meir:</span> Also freedom is detrimental. It disqualifies a slave from eating Terumah, just like divorce!</p>
<p class="bas indent2"><span class="nm">3.</span><span class="cl">Chachamim:</span> That is because a slave is his master's property. (This will be explained.)</p>
<p class="bas indent1"><span class="nm">(c)</span><span class="cl">(Gemara - Rav Huna):</span> We learn from Chachamim that if one seized property from a borrower to acquire it on behalf of a creditor, he acquires it for him (just like a Shali'ach acquires a Get for a slave).</p>
<p class="bas indent1"><span class="nm">(d)</span><span class="cl">Question (R. Yitzchak bar Yosef):</span> Does this apply even if this harms others? (There are other creditors who would have wanted to seize the property.)</p>
<p class="bas indent1"><span class="nm">(e)</span><span class="cl">Answer (Rav Huna):</span> Yes!</p>
<p class="bas indent1"><span class="nm">(f)</span><span class="cl">Rejection (R. Yirmeyah):</span> R. Yochanan taught that if one seized property from a borrower on behalf of a creditor when this harms others, he did not acquire.</p>
<p class="bas indent2"><span class="nm">1.</span>Your proof from our Mishnah is invalid. One who says 'give' means 'acquire for.' (Reuven himself told the Shali'ach to acquire.)</p>
<p class="bas indent1"><span class="nm">(g)</span><span class="cl">(Rav Chisda):</span> R. Eliezer and Chachamim argue about one who seizes property from a borrower on behalf of a creditor when this harms others:</p>
<p class="bas indent2"><span class="nm">1.</span><span class="cl">(Mishnah - R. Eliezer):</span> If Levi gathered Pe'ah (produce in the corner of the field which is left for the poor) and said 'this is for Ploni the Oni (poor person)', he acquired for him;</p>
<p class="bas indent2"><span class="nm">2.</span>Chachamim say, he must give it to the first Oni he finds.</p>
