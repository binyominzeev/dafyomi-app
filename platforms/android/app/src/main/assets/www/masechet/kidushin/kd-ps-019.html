<p class="bas subject"><span class="nm">1)</span>CAN A BOY BE MARRIED?</p>
<p class="bas indent1"><span class="nm">(a)</span><span class="cl">Question (Reish Lakish):</span> Can a man be Meya'ed his Amah to a son who is a minor?</p>
<p class="bas indent2"><span class="nm">1.</span>"Li'Vno" connotes any son;</p>
<p class="bas indent2"><span class="nm">2.</span>Or, perhaps the son must be like the father, i.e. an adult.</p>
<p class="bas indent1"><span class="nm">(b)</span><span class="cl">Answer #1 (R. Zeira - Beraisa):</span> (Capital punishment for adultery is for) "a man" - this excludes a minor. "Who will have adultery with the wife of a man" excludes the wife of a minor.</p>
<p class="bas indent2"><span class="nm">1.</span>If Yi'ud to a minor works, a minor can have a wife!</p>
<p class="bas indent1"><span class="nm">(c)</span><span class="cl">Objection:</span> If Yi'ud to a minor is invalid, we would not need a verse to exclude a minor's wife!</p>
<p class="bas indent1"><span class="nm">(d)</span><span class="cl">Conclusion:</span> Yi'ud to a minor is valid. (The Torah decreed that others are not killed for Bi'ah with his wife.)</p>
<p class="bas indent1"><span class="nm">(e)</span><span class="cl">Rejection (Rav Ashi):</span> No, the verse excludes a Yavam above nine who did Yibum;</p>
<p class="bas indent2"><span class="nm">1.</span>Since the Yevamah falls to him to Yibum, and his Bi'ah is considered Bi'ah, one might have thought she becomes his full wife, and one who has Bi'ah with her is killed. The verse teaches that this is not so.</p>
<p class="bas indent1"><span class="nm">(f)</span><span class="cl">Answer #2 (R. Eibo):</span> Yi'ud can be only with an adult. Yi'ud requires Da'as (understanding).</p>
<p class="bas indent1"><span class="nm">(g)</span><span class="cl">Question:</span> Why must he say both? Only adults have understanding!</p>
<p class="bas indent1"><span class="nm">(h)</span><span class="cl">Answer #1:</span> He means that Yi'ud can be only with an adult because Yi'ud requires Da'as.</p>
<p class="bas indent1"><span class="nm">(i)</span><span class="cl">Answer #2:</span> He teaches that Yi'ud requires her Da'as.</p>
<p class="bas indent2"><span class="nm">1.</span><span class="cl">(Abaye Brei d'R. Avahu - Beraisa):</span> "Ya'adah" - he must inform her that he is doing Yi'ud.</p>
<p class="bas indent2"><span class="nm">2.</span><span class="cl">(Abaye Brei d'R. Avahu):</span> This is like Rebbi Yosi b'Rebbi Yehudah, who says that the money paid for an Amah was not given for Kidushin (therefore, she must agree to Yi'ud).</p>
<p class="bas indent2"><span class="nm">3.</span><span class="cl">(Rav Nachman bar Yitzchak):</span> We understand the Beraisa even if the money paid for an Amah was given for Kidushin. The Torah decreed that he must inform her!</p>
<p class="bas subject"><span class="nm">2)</span>REBBI YOSI BAR YEHUDAH'S OPINION</p>
<p class="bas indent1"><span class="nm">(a)</span><span class="cl">Question:</span> Where did Rebbi Yosi b'Rebbi Yehudah discuss the money for an Amah?</p>
<p class="bas indent1"><span class="nm">(b)</span><span class="cl">Answer (Beraisa - Rebbi Yosi b'Rebbi Yehudah):</span> "Ya'adah v'Hefdah" - when he makes Yi'ud, she must be able to be redeemed.</p>
<p class="bas indent2"><span class="nm">1.</span>Yi'ud works only if it there is enough time left (in her six years of service) for her to do a Perutah's worth of labor.</p>
<p class="bas indent2"><span class="nm">2.</span><span class="cl">Inference:</span> This is because the initial money was not given for Kidushin (and he now is Mekadesh her with the value of the work she must still do for him).</p>
<p class="bas indent1"><span class="nm">(c)</span><span class="cl">Rejection (Rav Nachman bar Yitzchak):</span> Perhaps he can hold that the money was given for Kidushin. The Torah decreed that Yi'ud only works if she could have been redeemed.</p>
<p class="bas indent1"><span class="nm">(d)</span><span class="cl">(Rava):</span> From Rebbi Yosi b'Rebbi Yehudah, we learn that (even according to Chachamim) a man can authorize his daughter to receive her own Kidushin money.</p>
<p class="bas indent2"><span class="nm">1.</span>He holds that the initial money was not given for Kidushin (and now he is Mekadesh her with the value of the work she must still do for him);</p>
<p class="bas indent2"><span class="nm">2.</span>It must be that a man can authorize his daughter to receive her own Kidushin money (even without selling her)!</p>
<p class="bas indent1"><span class="nm">(e)</span><span class="cl">(Rava):</span> From Rebbi Yosi b'Rebbi Yehudah, we learn that (even according to Chachamim) a man can be Mekadesh a woman with a loan (that she owes to him) for which he has a security.</p>
<p class="bas indent2"><span class="nm">1.</span>He holds that the initial money was not given for Kidushin. He is Mekadesh her with the work she owes him);</p>
<p class="bas indent2"><span class="nm">2.</span>She herself is a security for her debt.</p>
<p class="bas bbbline">19b----------------------------------------19b</p>
<p class="bas indent2"><span class="nm">3.</span>This shows that a man can be Mekadesh (any) woman with a loan for which he has collateral!</p>
<p class="bas indent1"><span class="nm">(f)</span><span class="cl">(Beraisa #1):</span> To make Yi'ud, a man tells her in front of two 'you are Mekudeshes to me.' This can be at the end of the six years, just before sundown.</p>
<p class="bas indent2"><span class="nm">1.</span>He then treats her like a wife, not like a slave.</p>
<p class="bas indent1"><span class="nm">(g)</span>Rebbi Yosi b'Rebbi Yehudah says, she is Mekudeshes only if enough time remained for her to do a Perutah's worth of work.</p>
<p class="bas indent1"><span class="nm">(h)</span>A parable for this is when Reuven tells Leah 'you are Mekudeshes to me from now, after 30 days', and within the 30 days, David was Mekadesh her. She is Mekudeshes to Reuven.</p>
<p class="bas indent1"><span class="nm">(i)</span><span class="cl">Question:</span> Which Tana learns the law in the parable from Yi'ud (Rashi; Tosfos - learns Yi'ud from the parable)?</p>
<p class="bas indent2"><span class="nm">1.</span>It is not Rebbi Yosi b'Rebbi Yehudah. He says that she is Mekudeshes only if enough time remained for her to do a Perutah's worth of work! (This shows that the Kidushin begins only now.)</p>
<p class="bas indent1"><span class="nm">(j)</span><span class="cl">Answer (Rav Acha Brei d'Rava):</span> Rather, it is according to Chachamim.</p>
<p class="bas indent1"><span class="nm">(k)</span><span class="cl">Question:</span> This is obvious!</p>
<p class="bas indent1"><span class="nm">(l)</span><span class="cl">Version #1 (Rashi) Answer:</span> A master does not say that he is Mekadesh her from the moment he buys her. One might have thought that even if Reuven did not say that he is Mekadesh her from now, his Kidushin will prevail! Chachamim teach that this is not so.</p>
<p class="bas indent1"><span class="nm">(m)</span><span class="cl">Version #2 (Tosfos) Answer:</span> A master does not say that he is Mekadesh her from the moment he buys her. One might have thought that if a stranger was Mekadesh an Amah during her service, she is Mekudeshes to him. Chachamim teach that this is not so. (Rather, every sale of an Amah is as if he said 'on condition that Kidushin will begin from now, if I later make Yi'ud'.)</p>
<p class="bas indent1"><span class="nm">(n)</span><span class="cl">(Beraisa #2 - Rebbi Yosi b'Rebbi Yehudah):</span> Shimon sold his daughter to Kalev, then was Mekadesh her to Moshe, she is Mekudeshes to Moshe;</p>
<p class="bas indent1"><span class="nm">(o)</span>Chachamim say, if Kalev wants to do Yi'ud, this prevails over Moshe's Kidushin.</p>
<p class="bas indent1"><span class="nm">(p)</span>A parable for this is when Reuven tells Leah 'you are Mekudeshes to me after 30 days', and within the 30 days, David was Mekadesh her. She is Mekudeshes to David.</p>
<p class="bas indent1"><span class="nm">(q)</span><span class="cl">Question:</span> Which Tana learns the law in the parable from Yi'ud (Rashi; Tosfos - learns Yi'ud from the parable)?</p>
<p class="bas indent2"><span class="nm">1.</span>It cannot be Chachamim. They say that the master can do Yi'ud if he wants (even if a Perutah of servitude does not remain, for the Kidushin began from the initial sale)!</p>
<p class="bas indent1"><span class="nm">(r)</span><span class="cl">Answer (Rav Acha Brei d'Rava):</span> Rather, it is Rebbi Yosi b'Rebbi Yehudah.</p>
<p class="bas indent1"><span class="nm">(s)</span><span class="cl">Question:</span> This is obvious!</p>
<p class="bas indent1"><span class="nm">(t)</span><span class="cl">Version #1 (Rashi) Answer:</span> A master does not say that he may be Mekadesh her later (therefore, Yi'ud is not retroactive). One might have thought that when a man is Mekadesh a woman to take effect in 30 days, it works retroactively. Rebbi Yosi teaches that this is not so.</p>
<p class="bas indent1"><span class="nm">(u)</span><span class="cl">Version #2 (Tosfos) Answer:</span> A master does not say that Kidushin should not start now (rather, only after he does Yi'ud). One might have thought that Yi'ud makes Kidushin retroactively. Rebbi Yosi teaches that this is not so.</p>
<p class="bas subject"><span class="nm">3)</span>MUST YI'UD BE POSSIBLE?</p>
<p class="bas indent1"><span class="nm">(a)</span><span class="cl">(Beraisa - R. Meir):</span> If Reuven sold his daughter and stipulated that the master will not do Yi'ud, the stipulation is valid;</p>
<p class="bas indent1"><span class="nm">(b)</span>Chachamim say, he can do Yi'ud, for a stipulation contrary to Torah is void.</p>
<p class="bas indent1"><span class="nm">(c)</span><span class="cl">Question:</span> Elsewhere, R. Meir holds that a stipulation contrary to Torah is void!</p>
<p class="bas indent2"><span class="nm">1.</span><span class="cl">(Beraisa - R. Meir):</span> If one told a woman 'you are Mekudeshes to me on condition that you have no claim against me to give you food, clothing or Onah', she is Mekudeshes, and the stipulation is void;</p>
<p class="bas indent2"><span class="nm">2.</span>Rebbi Yehudah says, in monetary matters, the stipulation is valid.</p>
<p class="bas indent1"><span class="nm">(d)</span><span class="cl">Answer (Chizkiyah):</span> An Amah is an exception, for the Torah said "for an Amah" - a sale is valid even if it is only to be an Amah (and cannot result in Yi'ud).</p>
<p class="bas indent1"><span class="nm">(e)</span><span class="cl">Question:</span> What do Chachamim learn from the verse?</p>
<p class="bas indent1"><span class="nm">(f)</span><span class="cl">Answer (Beraisa):</span> "For an Amah" teaches that a girl can be sold to Pasul men (of improper lineage, who may not marry a Bas Yisrael. Then, the sale is only that she should be an Amah).</p>
<p class="bas indent2"><span class="nm">1.</span><span class="cl">Question:</span> Why is a verse needed? A Kal va'Chomer teaches that he can sell her to such men!</p>
<p class="bas indent3"><span class="nm">i.</span>A man can be Mekadesh his daughter to such men. All the more so, he can sell her to such men (perhaps he will not do Yi'ud)!</p>
<p class="bas indent2"><span class="nm">2.</span><span class="cl">Answer:</span> We cannot learn from Kidushin, for sometimes a man can be Mekadesh his daughter even though he cannot sell her, e.g. when she is a Na'arah;</p>
<p class="bas indent3"><span class="nm">i.</span>Therefore, it needed to write "for an Amah."</p>
<p class="bas indent1"><span class="nm">(g)</span>R. Eliezer says, we already know that she can be sold to Pesulim! "If she will be bad in the eyes of her master", i.e. he may not marry her;</p>
<p class="bas indent2"><span class="nm">1.</span>"For an Amah" teaches that she can be sold to relatives (with whom Kidushin does not take effect).</p>
