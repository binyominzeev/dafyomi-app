<p class="bas subject"><span class="nm">1)</span>IF WITNESSES CAME AFTER AN ADMISSION TO A FINE (cont.)</p>
<p class="bas indent1"><span class="nm">(a)</span><span class="cl">Answer #2:</span> He was not in Beis Din at the time.</p>
<p class="bas indent1"><span class="nm">(b)</span><span class="cl">Question (Beraisa #2):</span> Your words have no effect, for you already admitted.</p>
<p class="bas indent2"><span class="nm">1.</span><span class="cl">Suggestion:</span> Tana'im argue about Rav Huna's law.</p>
<p class="bas indent3"><span class="nm">i.</span>Beraisa #1 said 'your words have no effect, for you have no witnesses'. It holds that witnesses obligate a fine even after admission;</p>
<p class="bas indent3"><span class="nm">ii.</span>Beraisa #2 said 'your words have no effect, for you already admitted.' It holds that witnesses do not obligate a fine after admission.</p>
<p class="bas indent1"><span class="nm">(c)</span><span class="cl">Answer:</span> No, all agree that he is exempt after admission;</p>
<p class="bas indent2"><span class="nm">1.</span>Beraisa #1 holds that the admission was not in Beis Din (so witnesses would help later). Beraisa #2 holds that the admission was in Beis Din.</p>
<p class="bas indent1"><span class="nm">(d)</span><span class="cl">(Rav):</span> If one admitted to a fine, and witnesses came later, he is exempt;</p>
<p class="bas indent1"><span class="nm">(e)</span><span class="cl">(Shmuel):</span> He is liable.</p>
<p class="bas indent1"><span class="nm">(f)</span><span class="cl">(Rava bar Ahilai):</span> Rav learns from "if (a thief) will be found" - through witnesses. "He will be found" - through the judges (liable to pay the fine);</p>
<p class="bas indent2"><span class="nm">1.</span>This excludes one who incriminates himself.</p>
<p class="bas indent2"><span class="nm">2.</span><span class="cl">Question:</span> We already know this from "whom the judges will convict"!</p>
<p class="bas indent2"><span class="nm">3.</span><span class="cl">Answer:</span> Rather, the first verse exempts one who admits to a fine even if witnesses come later.</p>
<p class="bas indent1"><span class="nm">(g)</span>Shmuel uses that verse to obligate an actual thief (to pay Kefel for anything), like Tana d'Vei Chizkiyah (64a).</p>
<p class="bas indent1"><span class="nm">(h)</span><span class="cl">Question (Rav - Mishnah):</span> If a thief saw witnesses (about his theft) coming to Beis Din, and admitted to the theft but not the slaughter, he pays only principal (even after the witnesses testify)!</p>
<p class="bas indent1"><span class="nm">(i)</span><span class="cl">Answer #1 (Shmuel):</span> No. The case is, the witnesses never came to Beis Din to testify.</p>
<p class="bas indent1"><span class="nm">(j)</span><span class="cl">Question (Reisha - R. Elazar b'Rebbi Shimon):</span> The witnesses may come and testify.</p>
<p class="bas indent2"><span class="nm">1.</span>This shows that Chachamim do not accept their testimony!</p>
<p class="bas indent1"><span class="nm">(k)</span><span class="cl">Answer #2 (Shmuel):</span> I hold like R. Elazar b'Rebbi Shimon.</p>
<p class="bas indent1"><span class="nm">(l)</span><span class="cl">Question:</span> Shmuel's opinion can only be like R. Elazar b'Rebbi Shimon; 1.  Is Rav's opinion only like Chachamim?</p>
<p class="bas indent1"><span class="nm">(m)</span><span class="cl">Answer:</span> No. Rav can say that all agree to his law;</p>
<p class="bas indent2"><span class="nm">1.</span>Even R. Elazar b'Rebbi Shimon allows the witnesses to testify only because the admission was due to the witnesses. He agrees that one who freely admits is exempt, even if witnesses come later.</p>
<p class="bas subject"><span class="nm">2)</span>MUST THE ADMISSION OBLIGATE HIM?</p>
<p class="bas indent1"><span class="nm">(a)</span><span class="cl">(Rav Hamnuna):</span> Presumably, Rav's law is only when he admitted to stealing before witnesses came, for he obligated himself to pay principal (so he is exempt from Kefel);</p>
<p class="bas indent2"><span class="nm">1.</span>But if he denied stealing, and witnesses testified that he stole, and then he admitted to slaughtering or selling before witnesses about the slaughter or sale came, he is liable, for his admission did not obligate himself to pay anything!</p>
<p class="bas indent1"><span class="nm">(b)</span><span class="cl">Version #1 (Rashi, according to Tosfos) - Rava:</span> You pained the Talmidim (by saying something false)!</p>
<p class="bas indent1"><span class="nm">(c)</span><span class="cl">Version #2 (Tosfos) - Rava:</span> You (Rav Hamnuna) surpassed the elder of Rav's Talmidim (Rav Huna)!</p>
<p class="bas indent2"><span class="nm">1.</span>When R. Gamliel admitted to blinding Tavi, he did not obligate himself at all;</p>
<p class="bas indent2"><span class="nm">2.</span>Rav Chisda tried to disprove Rav from that Beraisa. Rav Huna did not (know to give your) answer that R. Gamliel's admission did not exempt him because he did not obligate himself! (end of Version #2)</p>
<p class="bas indent1"><span class="nm">(d)</span><span class="cl">(R. Chiya bar Aba):</span> If Reuven admitted to stealing, then two witnesses testified that he stole, he is exempt, because he obligated himself to pay principal;</p>
<p class="bas indent2"><span class="nm">1.</span>But if he denied stealing, and witnesses testified that he stole, and then he admitted to slaughtering or selling, then witnesses testified that he slaughtered or sold, he is liable, for his admission did not obligate himself to pay anything.</p>
<p class="bas indent1"><span class="nm">(e)</span><span class="cl">(Rav Ashi):</span> Our Mishnah and a Beraisa support this.</p>
<p class="bas indent2"><span class="nm">1.</span><span class="cl">(Mishnah):</span> If two witnesses testified that Reuven stole, and one witness testified or he admitted that he slaughtered or sold, he pays Kefel, but not four or five.</p>
<p class="bas indent2"><span class="nm">2.</span><span class="cl">Question:</span> Why must it say that two witnesses testified that Reuven stole? Let it say that if one witness testified, or he admitted that he stole and slaughtered or sold, he only pays principal!</p>
<p class="bas bbbline">75b----------------------------------------75b</p>
<p class="bas indent2"><span class="nm">3.</span><span class="cl">Answer:</span> The Mishnah teaches that we equate admission to slaughtering or selling and testimony of one witness (if more witness(es) come later, he will pay a total of four or five) only when his admission did not obligate himself;</p>
<p class="bas indent3"><span class="nm">i.</span>However, if one witness testified that he stole and slaughtered or sold, this is unlike admission to this, if more witness(es) come later;</p>
<p class="bas indent3"><span class="nm">ii.</span>If he did not admit, once there are two witnesses, he pays four or five;</p>
<p class="bas indent3"><span class="nm">iii.</span>When he admitted and his admission obligated him to pay principal, he is exempt from the fine.</p>
<p class="bas indent1"><span class="nm">(f)</span><span class="cl">(Beraisa):</span> If a thief saw witnesses (about his theft) coming to Beis Din, and he admitted to the theft but not to the slaughter, he only pays principal (even after the witnesses testify).</p>
<p class="bas indent2"><span class="nm">1.</span><span class="cl">Question:</span> Why doesn't the Beraisa say that when he admitted to stealing or slaughtering or selling, he does not pay four or five?</p>
<p class="bas indent2"><span class="nm">2.</span><span class="cl">Answer:</span> If he denied stealing, and after witnesses testified that he stole he admitted to slaughtering or selling (and witnesses later testified about this), he pays four or five;</p>
<p class="bas indent3"><span class="nm">i.</span>Since his admission did not obligate him, it does not exempt him from a fine.</p>
<p class="bas indent1"><span class="nm">(g)</span><span class="cl">Rejection:</span> No. Rather, the Beraisa teaches that admission to stealing exempts him from four and five, even if he denied slaughtering or selling and witnesses testify that he did.</p>
<p class="bas indent1"><span class="nm">(h)</span><span class="cl">Question:</span> What is the reason?</p>
<p class="bas indent1"><span class="nm">(i)</span><span class="cl">Answer:</span> Admission to stealing exempts him from Kefel. The Torah never obligated paying three or four (i.e. four or five less the extra 'one' of Kefel).</p>
<p class="bas indent1"><span class="nm">(j)</span><span class="cl">Suggestion:</span> Tana'im argue about this.</p>
<p class="bas indent2"><span class="nm">1.</span><span class="cl">(Beraisa):</span> If two witnesses testified that Reuven stole, and two others testified that he slaughtered or sold, and the witnesses about the theft were Huzmu, testimony that is partially nullified is totally nullified (Reuven is exempt);</p>
<p class="bas indent2"><span class="nm">2.</span>If the witnesses about the slaughter or sale were Huzmu, Reuven pays Kefel, and the Edim Zomemim pay two or three;</p>
<p class="bas indent2"><span class="nm">3.</span>Sumchus says, the Edim Zomemim pay Kefel, and Reuven pays two for a Seh or three for an ox.</p>
<p class="bas indent2"><span class="nm">4.</span><span class="cl">Question:</span> Does Sumchus argue about the first or second law?</p>
<p class="bas indent3"><span class="nm">i.</span><span class="cl">Suggestion:</span> He argues about the first law.</p>
<p class="bas indent3"><span class="nm">ii.</span><span class="cl">Rejection:</span> Surely he agree that partially nullified testimony is totally nullified!</p>
<p class="bas indent2"><span class="nm">5.</span><span class="cl">Answer #1:</span> Rather, he argues with the second law.</p>
<p class="bas indent2"><span class="nm">6.</span><span class="cl">Question:</span> Why does he argue with Chachamim? Their law is sound!</p>
<p class="bas indent2"><span class="nm">7.</span><span class="cl">Answer #2:</span> Rather, they argue in a different case. (The Beraisa did not state the case, nor Chachamim's opinion. The Gemara asserts that the case is as follows.)</p>
<p class="bas indent3"><span class="nm">i.</span>Two witnesses said 'you stole'; Reuven answered, I stole and slaughtered or sold, but I did not steal in front of you. Two other witnesses were Mezim the first two. Witnesses then testified that Reuven stole and slaughtered or sold.</p>
<p class="bas indent3"><span class="nm">ii.</span>Chachamim hold that even though the admission to stealing was because of the witnesses, the admission to slaughtering or selling was voluntary, so it exempts Reuven from four or five. (The Edim Zomemim pay Kefel, and Reuven uses it to pay the one from whom he stole.</p>
<p class="bas indent3"><span class="nm">iii.</span>Sumchus holds that since the admission to stealing was due to the witnesses, also the admission to slaughtering or selling does not exempt Reuven from the fine.</p>
<p class="bas indent3"><span class="nm">iv.</span>Therefore, the Edim Zomemim pay Kefel, and Reuven pays two for a Seh or three for an ox.</p>
<p class="bas subject"><span class="nm">3)</span>TESTIMONY THAT CANNOT BE <i>HUZAM</i></p>
<p class="bas indent1"><span class="nm">(a)</span><span class="cl">Rejection (and Answer #3 to Question 2:j:4 - Rav Acha brei d'Rav Ika):</span> No. All agree, admission to slaughtering does nothing. They argue about testimony that cannot be Huzam.</p>
<p class="bas indent2"><span class="nm">1.</span>If two witnesses said 'you stole', and Reuven answered, I stole and slaughtered or sold, but I did not steal in front of you, rather, in front of Ploni and Almoni, and Ploni and Almoni testified that he stole and slaughtered or sold.</p>
<p class="bas indent2"><span class="nm">2.</span>Chachamim hold that since Ploni and Almoni cannot be Huzmu (for Reuven admitted that they saw him steal and slaughter or sell), their testimony is invalid;</p>
<p class="bas indent2"><span class="nm">3.</span>Sumchus says, even though they cannot be Huzmu, their testimony is valid.</p>
<p class="bas indent1"><span class="nm">(b)</span><span class="cl">Question:</span> We hold that testimony that cannot be Huzam is invalid!</p>
<p class="bas indent1"><span class="nm">(c)</span><span class="cl">Answer:</span> That is only when the witnesses do not know at what time they saw the testimony. Such testimony is worthless;</p>
<p class="bas indent2"><span class="nm">1.</span>Here, the accused supports the testimony!</p>
<p class="bas indent1"><span class="nm">(d)</span><span class="cl">(Beraisa):</span> The Edim Zomemim pay Kefel...</p>
<p class="bas indent1"><span class="nm">(e)</span><span class="cl">Question:</span> Since Reuven admits that he stole, he should pay principal, (they should only pay him one)!</p>
<p class="bas indent1"><span class="nm">(f)</span><span class="cl">Correction (R. Elazar):</span> The Beraisa should say, they pay the extra payment (of Kefel).</p>
