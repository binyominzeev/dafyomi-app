<div class="subject"><span class="nm">1)</span><p>INCONSISTENT RULINGS</p></div>
<div class="indent1"><span class="nm">(a)</span><p><span class="cl">(Beraisa):</span> The Halachah always follows Beis Hillel. One may choose to hold like Beis Shamai, or like Beis Hillel;</p></div>
<div class="indent1"><span class="nm">(b)</span><p>If one holds like the leniencies of both, he is wicked;</p></div>
<div class="indent1"><span class="nm">(c)</span><p>If one holds like the stringencies of both (when they are inconsistent), he is a fool walking in darkness.</p></div>
<div class="indent2"><span class="nm">1.</span><p>Rather, one must hold consistently like Beis Shamai, or like Beis Hillel.</p></div>
<div class="indent1"><span class="nm">(d)</span><p><span class="cl">Question:</span> The Beraisa contradicts itself!</p></div>
<div class="indent2"><span class="nm">1.</span><p>First it says that the Halachah always follows Beis Hillel. Then it says that one may choose to hold like Beis Shamai!</p></div>
<div class="indent1"><span class="nm">(e)</span><p><span class="cl">Answer #1:</span> Before the Bas Kol (voice from Heaven) announced that the Halachah follows Beis Hillel, one could choose to hold like Beis Shamai. After the Bas Kol, the Halachah follows Beis Hillel.</p></div>
<div class="indent1"><span class="nm">(f)</span><p><span class="cl">Answer #2:</span> The entire Mishnah is after the Bas Kol.</p></div>
<div class="indent2"><span class="nm">1.</span><p>The first Tana says that we heed the Bas Kol. The second Tana is R. Yehoshua, who says that we do not heed a Bas Kol.</p></div>
<div class="indent1"><span class="nm">(g)</span><p><span class="cl">Question:</span> Why did Rava rule according to stringencies that are inconsistent with each other?</p></div>
<div class="indent1"><span class="nm">(h)</span><p><span class="cl">Answer (Rav Tavos):</span> Rava ruled entirely like Rav.</p></div>
<div class="indent2"><span class="nm">1.</span><p><span class="cl">(Rami bar Yechezkel):</span> What was taught in the name of Rav (43b) is according to Rav Yehudah, but Rav did not really say that!</p></div>
<div class="indent3"><span class="nm">i.</span><p>Really, Rav holds that Chachamim specified which parts of the Veshet are valid for Shechitah. (This implies that the ends, including Turbatz Veshet, are invalid);</p></div>
<div class="indent3"><span class="nm">ii.</span><p>Nevertheless, Rav holds that if Turbatz Veshet is cut at all, it is Tereifah.</p></div>
<div class="subject"><span class="nm">2)</span><p>TURBATZ VESHET</p></div>
<div class="indent1"><span class="nm">(a)</span><p><span class="cl">Question:</span> How much of the top end of the Veshet is invalid for Shechitah?</p></div>
<div class="indent1"><span class="nm">(b)</span><p><span class="cl">Answer (Rav Nachman):</span> It is the amount that can be held in one's hand (Rashi - the width of three or four fingers; Tosfos - two fingers).</p></div>
<div class="indent1"><span class="nm">(c)</span><p><span class="cl">Question:</span> How much of the bottom end of the Veshet is invalid for Shechitah?</p></div>
<div class="indent1"><span class="nm">(d)</span><p><span class="cl">Answer (Rav Nachman):</span> Until the part that has hair on it is invalid.</p></div>
<div class="indent1"><span class="nm">(e)</span><p><span class="cl">Question:</span> Rav taught that the last Tefach of the Veshet closest to the Keres is the inner Keres. (The entire Veshet has no hair, so it is fitting for Shechitah.) How can one slaughter the inner Keres?!</p></div>
<div class="indent1"><span class="nm">(f)</span><p><span class="cl">Answer #1:</span> Rather, the Tefach of the Keres closest to the Veshet is the inner Keres.</p></div>
<div class="indent1"><span class="nm">(g)</span><p><span class="cl">Answer #2:</span> Rav discussed an ox, which has hair on the end of the Veshet.</p></div>
<div class="indent1"><span class="nm">(h)</span><p><span class="cl">(Shmuel):</span> If the entire Turbatz Veshet was removed from the jaw, the animal is Kosher.</p></div>
<div class="indent1"><span class="nm">(i)</span><p><span class="cl">Support (Mishnah):</span> If the lower jaw was removed, it is Kosher.</p></div>
<div class="indent1"><span class="nm">(j)</span><p><span class="cl">Question (against Shmuel - Rav Papa):</span> Ikur (if the Simanim were uprooted) disqualifies Shechitah!</p></div>
<div class="indent2"><span class="nm">1.</span><p><span class="cl">Counter-question:</span> How does Rav Papa understand the Mishnah?</p></div>
<div class="indent2"><span class="nm">2.</span><p><span class="cl">Answer:</span> If the Siman 	is uprooted from the jaw and from the flesh, this disqualifies Shechitah. The Mishnah discusses when the jaw was removed from the flesh, but the Simanim are still connected to the flesh.</p></div>
<div class="indent1"><span class="nm">(k)</span><p><span class="cl">Answer:</span> Shmuel meant only that most of the Turbatz Veshet was removed</p></div>
<div class="indent1"><span class="nm">(l)</span><p><span class="cl">Question:</span> Shmuel taught that if most of the Simanim are dangling, it is Tereifah!</p></div>
<div class="indent1"><span class="nm">(m)</span><p><span class="cl">Answer:</span> That is when they were yanked forcefully. If they were gently peeled off, it is Kosher.</p></div>
<div class="subject"><span class="nm">3)</span><p>A CUT KANEH</p></div>
<div class="indent1"><span class="nm">(a)</span><p><span class="cl">(Mishnah):</span> If the Kaneh was cut (it is Tereifah).</p></div>
<div class="indent1"><span class="nm">(b)</span><p><span class="cl">(Beraisa):</span> The majority must be cut.</p></div>
<div class="indent1"><span class="nm">(c)</span><p><span class="cl">Question:</span> The majority of what (must be cut)?</p></div>
<div class="indent1"><span class="nm">(d)</span><p><span class="cl">Version #1 - Answer (Rav):</span> The majority of the width of the (entire) Kaneh (the walls of the Kaneh are part of the calculation).</p></div>
<div class="bbbline">44b----------------------------------------44b</p></div>
<div class="indent1"><span class="nm">(e)</span><p><span class="cl">Version #2 - Answer (Rav):</span> It is the majority of the interior of the Kaneh.</p></div>
<div class="indent1"><span class="nm">(f)</span><p>A case of a cut Kaneh was brought in front of Rav He was checking if the majority of the width of the Kaneh was cut.</p></div>
<div class="indent1"><span class="nm">(g)</span><p><span class="cl">Question (Rav Kahana and Rav Asi):</span> You taught that we require only the majority of the interior!</p></div>
<div class="indent2"><span class="nm">1.</span><p>They sent it to Rabah bar bar Chanah to check. He checked for the majority of the interior, and ruled that it was Kosher. He himself bought some of the meat.</p></div>
<div class="indent1"><span class="nm">(h)</span><p><span class="cl">Question:</span> How could he permit what Rav forbade?</p></div>
<div class="indent2"><span class="nm">1.</span><p><span class="cl">(Beraisa):</span> A Chacham may not be Metaher or permit the same matter that another Chacham was Metamei or forbade (Tosfos - based on his own reasoning, but he may do so if his Rebbi taught him otherwise).</p></div>
<div class="indent1"><span class="nm">(i)</span><p><span class="cl">Answer:</span> Rav never ruled that it was Tereifah.</p></div>
<div class="subject"><span class="nm">4)</span><p>CONDUCT EXPECTED OF CHACHAMIM</p></div>
<div class="indent1"><span class="nm">(a)</span><p><span class="cl">Question:</span> Since a Chacham had to permit it, how could Rabah bar bar Chanah eat from it?</p></div>
<div class="indent2"><span class="nm">1.</span><p>Yechezkel said about himself "I did not make my soul Tamei. I never ate Neveilah or Tereifah, Pigul (abominable) meat did not enter my mouth."</p></div>
<div class="indent2"><span class="nm">2.</span><p>"I did not make my soul Tamei" - I did not have emissions at night due to thinking about women during the day;</p></div>
<div class="indent2"><span class="nm">3.</span><p>"I never ate Neveilah or Tereifah" - I did not eat from an animal that was hurriedly slaughtered before it dies;</p></div>
<div class="indent2"><span class="nm">4.</span><p>"Abominable meat did not enter my mouth" - I did not eat from an animal that needed a Chacham to rule that it was Kosher;</p></div>
<div class="indent2"><span class="nm">5.</span><p>R. Noson explains, I did not eat from an animal before the gifts to the Kohen were separated.</p></div>
<div class="indent1"><span class="nm">(b)</span><p><span class="cl">Answer:</span> A Chacham should refrain only from an animal permitted through reasoning. Rabah bar bar Chanah had a tradition that the majority of the interior must be cut to make it Tereifah. (Tosfos - this is a second answer to Question 3:h.)</p></div>
<div class="indent1"><span class="nm">(c)</span><p><span class="cl">Question:</span> He should not have eaten, due to suspicion!</p></div>
<div class="indent2"><span class="nm">1.</span><p><span class="cl">(Beraisa):</span> If a judge ruled or witnesses testified about something, they may buy it later;</p></div>
<div class="indent2"><span class="nm">2.</span><p>Still, Chachamim say that one should distance himself from anything that may lead to suspicion (that they are receiving a discount to reward them for the ruling or testimony).</p></div>
<div class="indent1"><span class="nm">(d)</span><p><span class="cl">Answer:</span> That applies only to things sold by estimation. Rabah bar bar Chanah bought meat by weight. (All saw that he paid the usual price.)</p></div>
<div class="indent2"><span class="nm">1.</span><p>Rava permitted an animal and bought some of the meat.</p></div>
<div class="indent2"><span class="nm">2.</span><p><span class="cl">His wife:</span> My father (Rav Chisda) would never buy a Bechor (firstborn animal) that he permitted (to be slaughtered due to a blemish)!</p></div>
<div class="indent2"><span class="nm">3.</span><p><span class="cl">Rava:</span> A blemished Bechor must be sold by estimation, without weighing. Had he bought, people could suspect that he got a discount;</p></div>
<div class="indent3"><span class="nm">i.</span><p>I bought meat by weight. All saw that I paid the full price.</p></div>
<div class="indent3"><span class="nm">ii.</span><p><span class="cl">Suggestion:</span> Perhaps people will think that I got a nicer piece due to my ruling!</p></div>
<div class="indent3"><span class="nm">iii.</span><p><span class="cl">Rejection:</span> They always give me a nice piece!</p></div>
<div class="indent1"><span class="nm">(e)</span><p><span class="cl">(Rav Chisda):</span> A Chacham (to whom we return a lost object if he says that he recognizes it, without giving a Siman) is one who rules that his own animal is Tereifah (when he cannot resolve a doubt);</p></div>
<div class="indent2"><span class="nm">1.</span><p>He fulfills "one who hates gifts will live."</p></div>
<div class="indent1"><span class="nm">(f)</span><p><span class="cl">(Mar Zutra):</span> If one learns written Torah, Mishnah, the reasons and resolutions of the Mishnayos, and rules that his own animal is Tereifah, he epitomizes "you will eat the work of your hands. You are happy, and it will be good for you."</p></div>
<div class="indent2"><span class="nm">1.</span><p><span class="cl">(Rav Zvid):</span> He inherits both worlds. "You are happy" in this world. "It will be good for you" in the world to come.</p></div>
<div class="indent1"><span class="nm">(g)</span><p>R. Elazar would not accept gifts from the Nasi's house, and he would decline invitations to eat there - "one who hates gifts will live".</p></div>
<div class="indent1"><span class="nm">(h)</span><p>R. Zeira would not accept gifts from the Nasi's house, but he would eat there when invited. He reasoned that they are honored through his coming.</p></div>
