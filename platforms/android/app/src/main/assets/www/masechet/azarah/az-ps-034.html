<p class="bas subject"><span class="nm">1)</span>BOTTLES OF NOCHRIM</p>
<p class="bas indent1"><span class="nm">(a)</span><span class="cl">Summation of question:</span> Mereimar permitted all Klei Kunya of Nochrim. Regarding Chametz, he forbade them all!</p>
<p class="bas indent1"><span class="nm">(b)</span><span class="cl">Answer #1:</span> He is stringent about Chametz, for this is a mid'Oraisa Isur, but Yayin Nesech is mid'Rabanan.</p>
<p class="bas indent1"><span class="nm">(c)</span><span class="cl">Objection:</span> We make Rabbinical decrees like Torah law!</p>
<p class="bas indent1"><span class="nm">(d)</span><span class="cl">Answer #2:</span> The Kelim are used with hot Chametz (so they absorb). Wine is (normally) cold.</p>
<p class="bas indent1"><span class="nm">(e)</span><span class="cl">Question #1 (to R. Akiva; Rashi - to Mar Ukva):</span> May one accept a fast for part of a day (Rashi - if he did not eat in the morning, may he vow not to eat the rest of the day)?</p>
<p class="bas indent1"><span class="nm">(f)</span><span class="cl">Question #2:</span> Are bottles of Nochrim permitted?</p>
<p class="bas indent1"><span class="nm">(g)</span><span class="cl">Question #3:</span> What garments did Moshe wear during the seven days in which he erected the Mishkan and served in it?</p>
<p class="bas indent1"><span class="nm">(h)</span>He could not answer any of these.</p>
<p class="bas indent1"><span class="nm">(i)</span><span class="cl">Answers (Rabanan of the Beis Medrash):</span> One may accept a fast for part of a day. If he finished (Shulchan Aruch - he did not eat yet today, and decided to fast the rest of the day, this is considered a fast, and) he can say the prayer that we say on fast days ('Aneinu');</p>
<p class="bas indent2"><span class="nm">1.</span>Bottles of Nochrim are permitted after 12 months; (Rashi - to use them before this, he must Kasher them by filling them with water three times);</p>
<p class="bas indent2"><span class="nm">2.</span>The seven days that Moshe served, he wore a white garment;</p>
<p class="bas indent3"><span class="nm">i.</span><span class="cl">(Rav Kahana):</span> The garment had no cuff (to show that it is a new garment, or that it was not meant to be permanent).</p>
<p class="bas subject"><span class="nm">2)</span>THINGS THAT ARE PERMITTED AFTER 12 MONTHS</p>
<p class="bas indent1"><span class="nm">(a)</span><span class="cl">(Mishnah):</span> Grape pits and skins of Nochrim...</p>
<p class="bas indent1"><span class="nm">(b)</span><span class="cl">(Beraisa):</span> Wet grape pits and skins of Nochrim are forbidden. Dry ones are permitted.</p>
<p class="bas indent1"><span class="nm">(c)</span><span class="cl">Question:</span> What is considered wet and dry?</p>
<p class="bas indent1"><span class="nm">(d)</span><span class="cl">Answer (Rav Yehudah):</span> There are considered wet for 12 months. After this, they are dry.</p>
<p class="bas indent1"><span class="nm">(e)</span><span class="cl">(Rabah bar Rav Huna):</span> When they are forbidden, one may not even benefit from them. When they are permitted, one may even eat them.</p>
<p class="bas indent1"><span class="nm">(f)</span><span class="cl">(Rav Zvid):</span> (R. Tam - Temed made from) dregs of wine of Nochrim are permitted after 12 months.</p>
<p class="bas indent1"><span class="nm">(g)</span><span class="cl">(Rav Chaviva brei d'Rava):</span> Empty Kelim of Nochrim are permitted after 12 months.</p>
<p class="bas indent1"><span class="nm">(h)</span><span class="cl">(Rav Chaviva):</span> A thick leather pouch of Nochrim (Rashi; Aruch - a food made with flour, spices, milk and wine) is permitted after 12 months.</p>
<p class="bas bbbline">34b----------------------------------------34b</p>
<p class="bas indent1"><span class="nm">(i)</span><span class="cl">(Rav Acha brei d'Rav Ika):</span> Grape pits of Nochrim are permitted after 12 months.</p>
<p class="bas indent1"><span class="nm">(j)</span><span class="cl">(Rav Acha brei d'Rava):</span> White or black Kelim of Nochrim are permitted after 12 months.</p>
<p class="bas subject"><span class="nm">3)</span>MURYAS</p>
<p class="bas indent1"><span class="nm">(a)</span><span class="cl">(Mishnah):</span> And Muryas (fish oil).</p>
<p class="bas indent1"><span class="nm">(b)</span><span class="cl">(Beraisa):</span> Muryas of a (Nochri) vendor is permitted;</p>
<p class="bas indent1"><span class="nm">(c)</span>R. Yehudah ben Gamliel says, even Chilak (Tahor fish that did not yet grow their fins and scales) of a (Nochri) vendor is permitted.</p>
<p class="bas indent1"><span class="nm">(d)</span><span class="cl">(Avimi brei d'R. Avahu):</span> Muryas of a vendor is permitted. This refers to the first two times they extract it from the fish, but the third time is forbidden.</p>
<p class="bas indent1"><span class="nm">(e)</span><span class="cl">Question:</span> What is the reason?</p>
<p class="bas indent1"><span class="nm">(f)</span><span class="cl">Answer:</span> The first two times it is strong, and it does not need wine (Rashi - wine will ruin it). The third time (Tosfos ha'Rosh - it is weak, so) he adds wine (Rashi - in a place where wine is cheaper than Muryas).</p>
<p class="bas indent1"><span class="nm">(g)</span>A boat loaded with Muryas entered the port of Ako. R. Aba of Ako set a Yisrael to guard it.</p>
<p class="bas indent2"><span class="nm">1.</span><span class="cl">Rava:</span> How does this help? It was not guarded until now!</p>
<p class="bas indent2"><span class="nm">2.</span><span class="cl">R. Aba:</span> Until now, there was no concern:</p>
<p class="bas indent3"><span class="nm">i.</span>He would not mix in wine, for wine was four times as expensive as Muryas (in the place it came from. Only here, wine is cheaper.)</p>
<p class="bas indent2"><span class="nm">3.</span><span class="cl">R. Yirmeyah:</span> The boat passed near Tzur (where wine is cheap)!</p>
<p class="bas indent2"><span class="nm">4.</span><span class="cl">R. Zeira:</span> It is too hard to dock in Tzur. The sea bends there and melting snow raises the water level.</p>
<p class="bas subject"><span class="nm">4)</span>CHEESE OF BEIS UNAIKI</p>
<p class="bas indent1"><span class="nm">(a)</span><span class="cl">(Mishnah):</span> Cheese of Beis Unaiki.</p>
<p class="bas indent1"><span class="nm">(b)</span><span class="cl">(Reish Lakish):</span> Cheese of Beis Unaiki is forbidden because most calves there are slaughtered for idolatry (perhaps the stomach of one of them was used to curdle the milk).</p>
<p class="bas indent1"><span class="nm">(c)</span><span class="cl">Question:</span> Even if the minority of calves there are slaughtered for idolatry, R. Meir would forbid, for he is concerned for a minority!</p>
<p class="bas indent1"><span class="nm">(d)</span><span class="cl">Answer:</span> If most calves are slaughtered for idolatry, R. Meir is concerned for the minority (calves are a minority of animals);</p>
<p class="bas indent2"><span class="nm">1.</span>However, if a minority of calves are slaughtered for idolatry, since calves are a minority of animals, a minority of a minority were slaughtered to idolatry. R. Meir is not concerned for this.</p>
<p class="bas indent1"><span class="nm">(e)</span><span class="cl">Question (R. Shimon bar Elyakim):</span> Even if it was slaughtered for (the sake of offering to) idolatry, you yourself permit it!</p>
<p class="bas indent2"><span class="nm">1.</span><span class="cl">(R. Yochanan):</span> If one slaughtered an animal in order to pour the blood or burn the Chelev to idolatry, the animal is forbidden;</p>
<p class="bas indent3"><span class="nm">i.</span>He holds that since he later intends to serve idolatry with this animal (by pouring or burning), we consider the required acts of service (slaughter) to also be for the sake of idolatry;</p>
<p class="bas indent3"><span class="nm">ii.</span>We learn from Avodah in the Mikdash. (If an Avodah was done with intent to do a later Avodah after the allotted time, this disqualifies the Korban (Pigul). It is as if the first Avodah was done improperly.)</p>
<p class="bas indent2"><span class="nm">2.</span><span class="cl">(Reish Lakish):</span> The animal is permitted;</p>
<p class="bas indent3"><span class="nm">i.</span>(We do not consider the requisite acts of service to also be for the sake of idolatry, for we do not learn laws of idolatry from Avodah in the Mikdash.)</p>
<p class="bas indent1"><span class="nm">(f)</span><span class="cl">Answer (Reish Lakish):</span> The case is, the slaughterer said in his heart 'I intend to serve idolatry by finishing the slaughter.'</p>
<p class="bas subject"><span class="nm">5)</span>PERESH OF A FORBIDDEN ANIMAL</p>
<p class="bas indent1"><span class="nm">(a)</span><span class="cl">(Mishnah - R. Yehudah):</span> R. Yishmael asked...</p>
<p class="bas indent1"><span class="nm">(b)</span><span class="cl">(Rav Achdevoy):</span> If a man was Mekadesh a woman with Peresh (intestinal fluids) of a Shor ha'Niskal (an ox sentenced to be stoned), she is Mekudeshes. If he was Mekadesh with Peresh of a calf offered to idolatry, she is not Mekudeshes.</p>
<p class="bas indent1"><span class="nm">(c)</span>We can learn from reasoning or verses.</p>
<p class="bas indent2"><span class="nm">1.</span>Reasoning - those who offer calves to idolatry prefer a fatter Korban. It is important, therefore it is forbidden like the calf;</p>
<p class="bas indent3"><span class="nm">i.</span>Regarding a Shor ha'Niskal, there is no value to the Peresh. It is not forbidden with the ox.</p>
<p class="bas indent2"><span class="nm">2.</span>From verses - it says about idolatry "v'Lo Yidbak b'Yadcha Me'umah Min ha'Cherem" (you may not get any benefit from it);</p>
<p class="bas indent3"><span class="nm">i.</span>It says about Shor ha'Niskal "v'Lo Ye'achel Es <i>Besaro</i>" - the meat is forbidden, but not the Peresh.</p>
