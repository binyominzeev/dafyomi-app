<p class="bas subject"><span class="nm">1)</span>A SLAVE WHO IMMERSED TO BECOME FREE</p>
<p class="bas indent1"><span class="nm">(a)</span><span class="cl">(Rav Chama bar Gurya):</span> If one bought a slave from a Nochri and the slave immersed l'Shem Ben Chorin (to become a free convert), he succeeded.</p>
<p class="bas indent1"><span class="nm">(b)</span>This is because the Nochri did not own the slave himself (just his earnings). The Yisrael cannot acquire more than the Nochri himself owned;</p>
<p class="bas indent2"><span class="nm">1.</span>Since the slave immersed to become free, this uproots his bondage, like Rava's law;</p>
<p class="bas indent2"><span class="nm">2.</span><span class="cl">(Rava):</span> The following uproot Shi'abud (a lien, on an object or slave): making it Hekdesh, Shichrur (freeing a slave), and the Isur of Chametz on Pesach.</p>
<p class="bas indent1"><span class="nm">(c)</span><span class="cl">Question (Rav Chisda - Beraisa):</span> A case occurred in which a woman converted, and her slaves immersed before she did. Chachamim ruled that they are free.</p>
<p class="bas indent2"><span class="nm">1.</span>Had they immersed after her, they would not be free!</p>
<p class="bas indent1"><span class="nm">(d)</span><span class="cl">Answer (Rava):</span> No. Since they immersed before her, they are free even if they did not specify their intent. Had they immersed after her, they would be free only if they specified that they immerse l'Shem Ben Chorin.</p>
<p class="bas indent1"><span class="nm">(e)</span><span class="cl">(Rav Avya):</span> This is only when a Yisrael buys from a Nochri. If one buys a Nochri himself, he acquires him.</p>
<p class="bas indent2"><span class="nm">1.</span>"...Mehem Tiknu" - you can buy them (to be slaves), but they cannot buy you, nor can they acquire one another.</p>
<p class="bas indent1"><span class="nm">(f)</span><span class="cl">Question:</span> In what sense can a Nochri not acquire?</p>
<p class="bas indent2"><span class="nm">1.</span><span class="cl">Suggestion:</span> He cannot acquire (even rights to receive) earnings.</p>
<p class="bas indent2"><span class="nm">2.</span><span class="cl">Rejection:</span> An Eved Ivri can be sold "... O l'Eker <i>Mishpachas Ger</i>", i.e. to a Nochri!</p>
<p class="bas indent1"><span class="nm">(g)</span><span class="cl">Answer:</span> Rather, "Mehem Tiknu" discusses acquiring the person himself, and it says that a Yisrael can acquire a Nochri.</p>
<p class="bas indent1"><span class="nm">(h)</span><span class="cl">Question (Rav Acha):</span> Perhaps he acquires only him through money and immersion (to become a slave), but before this, the Nochri may immerse l'Shem Ben Chorin!</p>
<p class="bas indent2"><span class="nm">1.</span>This is left difficult.</p>
<p class="bas indent1"><span class="nm">(i)</span><span class="cl">(Shmuel):</span> One must hold the slave in the water.</p>
<p class="bas indent2"><span class="nm">1.</span>Rav Ashi wanted to immerse Minyamin to be his slave. He handed him over to Ravina and Rav Acha, and said that they will be held responsible if he immerses to convert.</p>
<p class="bas indent2"><span class="nm">2.</span>They tied a chain around his neck, loosened it and tightened it.</p>
<p class="bas indent3"><span class="nm">i.</span>They loosened it, so it should not be a Chatzitzah (blockage that invalidates the immersion).</p>
<p class="bas indent3"><span class="nm">ii.</span>They tightened it, so he would not be able to say that he immersed l'Shem Ben Chorin.</p>
<p class="bas indent2"><span class="nm">3.</span>When they lifted his head from the water, they put a Kli of mud on his head and told him to take it to his master.</p>
<p class="bas indent1"><span class="nm">(j)</span><span class="cl">Question (Rav Papa):</span> People of Papa bar Aba's house pay people's taxes and use them as slaves. Do the slaves need a document of freedom when the servitude ends?</p>
<p class="bas indent1"><span class="nm">(k)</span><span class="cl">Rava:</span> Had I died before telling you, there would be no one to tell you!</p>
<p class="bas indent1"><span class="nm">(l)</span><span class="cl">Answer (Rava citing Rav Sheshes):</span> The king says that one who does not pay his own tax is a slave to the one who pays for him (therefore, a document is needed).</p>
<p class="bas indent1"><span class="nm">(m)</span>R. Chiya bar Aba went to Gavla. He saw Benos Yisrael that became pregnant from Nochrim who were circumcised, but did not immerse. He saw Jews drinking wine mixed by Nochrim and eating lupines cooked by Nochrim. He did not say anything; he came to R. Yochanan.</p>
<p class="bas indent1"><span class="nm">(n)</span><span class="cl">R. Yochanan:</span> Go announce that their children are Mamzerim, their wine is Yayin Nesech (wine offered to idolatry, which is forbidden), and their lupines are Bishul Akum (food cooked by Nochrim, which is forbidden), since they are not Bnei Torah (they are prone to extrapolate and say that other things are similarly permitted).</p>
<p class="bas indent2"><span class="nm">1.</span>R. Yochanan said that their children are Mamzerim. This is like his opinion that one is not a convert until he is circumcised and immerses, so the fathers were still Nochrim, and that the child of a Nochri or slave from a Bas Yisrael is a Mamzer.</p>
<p class="bas indent2"><span class="nm">2.</span>Their wine is Yayin Nesech. We tell a Nazir to go far from a vineyard (i.e. distance yourself from possible transgression. Here also we distance them from Aveirah; the Nochrim mixed the wine without touching it.)</p>
<p class="bas indent1"><span class="nm">(o)</span><span class="cl">Inference:</span> Their lupines are forbidden because they are not Bnei Torah, but Bnei Torah are permitted!</p>
<p class="bas indent1"><span class="nm">(p)</span><span class="cl">Question:</span> Rav Shmuel bar R. Yitzchak said that Bishul Akum does not apply to anything (normally) eaten raw. Lupines are not eaten raw!</p>
<p class="bas indent1"><span class="nm">(q)</span><span class="cl">Answer:</span> R. Yochanan (Tosfos - also) holds like the other version of Rav Shmuel's teaching:</p>
<p class="bas indent2"><span class="nm">1.</span><span class="cl">(Rav Shmuel bar R. Yitzchak):</span> Whatever does not come on the table of kings to be eaten with bread is permitted even if it was cooked by Nochrim.</p>
<p class="bas indent1"><span class="nm">(r)</span>Therefore, Bnei Torah are permitted.</p>
<p class="bas subject"><span class="nm">2)</span>THE ESSENTIAL STEPS OF CONVERSION</p>
<p class="bas indent1"><span class="nm">(a)</span><span class="cl">(Beraisa - R. Eliezer):</span> If a convert was circumcised but did not immerse, he is a (valid) convert, since our forefathers (who left Mitzrayim) converted this way;</p>
<p class="bas indent1"><span class="nm">(b)</span>R. Yehoshua says, if he immersed but was not circumcised he is a convert, since the women (of that generation) converted this way.</p>
<p class="bas indent1"><span class="nm">(c)</span>Chachamim say, one is not enough by itself. He is not a convert until he circumcises and immerses.</p>
<p class="bas indent1"><span class="nm">(d)</span><span class="cl">Question:</span> Why doesn't R. Yehoshua learn from the men, and why doesn't R. Eliezer learn from the women?</p>
<p class="bas indent2"><span class="nm">1.</span><span class="cl">Suggestion:</span> Perhaps we do not learn what is possible (Milah of men) from what is impossible (Milah of women).</p>
<p class="bas indent2"><span class="nm">2.</span><span class="cl">Rejection:</span> R. Eliezer does learn thusly!</p>
<p class="bas indent3"><span class="nm">i.</span><span class="cl">(Beraisa - R. Eliezer):</span> For all generations, Korban Pesach may not be brought from Ma'aser money. We learn this from the Pesach brought in Mitzrayim, which was not brought from Ma'aser.</p>
<p class="bas indent3"><span class="nm">ii.</span><span class="cl">R. Akiva:</span> Do we learn what is possible from what is impossible? (Ma'aser did not apply yet!)</p>
<p class="bas indent3"><span class="nm">iii.</span><span class="cl">R. Eliezer:</span> Yes! Even though it was impossible, we learn from it.</p>
<p class="bas bbbline">46b----------------------------------------46b</p>
<p class="bas indent1"><span class="nm">(e)</span><span class="cl">Retraction:</span> Rather, all agree that immersion without circumcision is a proper conversion. They argue about circumcision without immersion;</p>
<p class="bas indent1"><span class="nm">(f)</span>R. Eliezer learns from the men that this suffices. R. Yehoshua disagrees, because the men also immersed.</p>
<p class="bas indent1"><span class="nm">(g)</span><span class="cl">Question:</span> What is R. Yehoshua's source?</p>
<p class="bas indent2"><span class="nm">1.</span><span class="cl">Suggestion:</span> He learns from "...v'Kidashtam ha'Yom u'Machar v'Chibsu Simlosam". One must immerse himself even when he need not wash (immerse) his clothes (e.g. a Ba'al Keri), all the more so when he must wash his clothes!</p>
<p class="bas indent2"><span class="nm">2.</span><span class="cl">Rejection:</span> Perhaps they washed their clothes just for cleanliness!</p>
<p class="bas indent1"><span class="nm">(h)</span><span class="cl">Answer:</span> "Moshe took the blood and threw it on the people." We have a tradition that every Haza'ah (sprinkling) requires immersion first.</p>
<p class="bas indent1"><span class="nm">(i)</span><span class="cl">Question:</span> What is R. Yehoshua's source that the mothers immersed?</p>
<p class="bas indent1"><span class="nm">(j)</span><span class="cl">Answer:</span> It is logical. If not, what did they do to enter under Kanfei ha'Shechinah?!</p>
<p class="bas indent1"><span class="nm">(k)</span><span class="cl">(R. Chiya bar Avin):</span> One is not a convert until he circumcises and immerses.</p>
<p class="bas indent1"><span class="nm">(l)</span><span class="cl">Objection:</span> This is obvious. The Halachah follows the majority (Chachamim)!</p>
<p class="bas indent1"><span class="nm">(m)</span><span class="cl">Answer:</span> Elsewhere, Chachamim's opinion is attributed to an individual, R. Yosi.</p>
<p class="bas indent2"><span class="nm">1.</span><span class="cl">(Beraisa - R. Yehudah):</span> If a man says that he circumcised but did not immerse, we immerse him. We are not concerned for whether or not his circumcision was for the sake of conversion;</p>
<p class="bas indent2"><span class="nm">2.</span>R. Yosi says, we do not immerse him (without Hatafas Dam Bris, lest his Milah was not l'Shem Geirus).</p>
<p class="bas indent2"><span class="nm">3.</span>Therefore, R. Yehudah permits immersing a convert on Shabbos, and R. Yosi forbids.</p>
<p class="bas indent1"><span class="nm">(n)</span><span class="cl">Question:</span> R. Yehudah holds that one act is enough. Obviously, if he is circumcised he may immerse on Shabbos! (since Tevilah is unnecessary, it is not Tikun (fixing him).) What do we learn from 'therefore'?</p>
<p class="bas indent1"><span class="nm">(o)</span><span class="cl">Answer:</span> One might have thought that immersion is primary, so it is Tikun. The Seifa teaches that circumcision helps by itself, therefore he may immerse.</p>
<p class="bas indent1"><span class="nm">(p)</span><span class="cl">Question:</span> Why must it teach that R. Yosi forbids immersing a convert on Shabbos? Since he requires both, obviously Tevilah on Shabbos is Tikun and it is forbidden!</p>
<p class="bas indent1"><span class="nm">(q)</span><span class="cl">Answer:</span> One might have thought that he holds that circumcision is primary, and he forbids Tevilas Ger on Shabbos only if circumcision was not done in front of us, but not if we saw it. The Seifa teaches, he requires both and always forbids Tevilah on Shabbos.</p>
<p class="bas subject"><span class="nm">3)</span>CONDITIONS OF CONVERSION</p>
<p class="bas indent1"><span class="nm">(a)</span><span class="cl">(Rabah):</span> A case occurred in which a convert circumcised but did not immerse. R. Chiya bar Rebbi, R. Oshaya b'Ribi and R. Oshaya bar R. Chiya told him 'wait, and we will immerse you tomorrow.'</p>
<p class="bas indent1"><span class="nm">(b)</span>We learn three laws from this.</p>
<p class="bas indent2"><span class="nm">1.</span>Conversion requires three judges;</p>
<p class="bas indent2"><span class="nm">2.</span>One is not a convert until he circumcises and immerses;</p>
<p class="bas indent2"><span class="nm">3.</span>We do not immerse converts at night.</p>
<p class="bas indent1"><span class="nm">(c)</span><span class="cl">Question:</span> Why don't we also learn that expert judges are required?</p>
<p class="bas indent1"><span class="nm">(d)</span><span class="cl">Answer:</span> Perhaps it just happened that expert judges were there.</p>
<p class="bas indent1"><span class="nm">(e)</span><span class="cl">(R. Chiya bar Aba):</span> Three judges are needed for conversion, since it is called 'Mishpat' (judgment; "U'Mishpat Echad Yihyeh Lachem vela'Ger" - Bamidbar 15:16).</p>
<p class="bas subject"><span class="nm">4)</span>WHEN DO WE ACCEPT CONVERTS?</p>
<p class="bas indent1"><span class="nm">(a)</span><span class="cl">(Beraisa - R. Yehudah) Suggestion:</span> If a man claims to be a convert, perhaps we accept him!</p>
<p class="bas indent1"><span class="nm">(b)</span><span class="cl">Rejection:</span> "Itcha (with you)" - we accept him only if he is Muchzak (established) to you.</p>
<p class="bas indent1"><span class="nm">(c)</span>If he brings witnesses with him, he is believed - "When a convert will dwell with you".</p>
