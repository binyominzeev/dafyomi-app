<div class="indent1"><span class="nm">(a)</span><p><span class="cl">Question (Reish Lakish):</span> Either way you say, this is difficult!</p></div>
<div class="indent2"><span class="nm">1.</span><p>If a Korban offered Lo Lishmah is Kosher, it should atone (the owner should be Yotzei);</p></div>
<div class="indent2"><span class="nm">2.</span><p>If it does not atone, the Korban should be Pasul!</p></div>
<div class="indent1"><span class="nm">(b)</span><p><span class="cl">Answer #1 (R. Elazar):</span> Korbanos are brought after the owner died, and they are Kosher, even though they do not atone!</p></div>
<div class="indent2"><span class="nm">1.</span><p><span class="cl">(Mishnah):</span> If a woman (who gave birth) brought her Chatas and died (before bringing her Olah), her heirs bring her Olah;</p></div>
<div class="indent2"><span class="nm">2.</span><p>If she brought her Olah and died, her heirs do not bring her Chatas.</p></div>
<div class="indent1"><span class="nm">(c)</span><p><span class="cl">Rejection (Reish Lakish):</span> I agree regarding an Olah, since it is brought after death;</p></div>
<div class="indent2"><span class="nm">1.</span><p>An Asham is not brought after death. Since it does not atone (Lo Lishmah), it should be Pasul!</p></div>
<div class="indent2"><span class="nm">2.</span><p><span class="cl">R. Elazar:</span> Indeed, R. Eliezer in our Mishnah holds like you. He disqualifies an Asham Lo Lishmah!</p></div>
<div class="indent2"><span class="nm">3.</span><p><span class="cl">Reish Lakish:</span> I ask why Chachamim say that it is Kosher. Do not answer me from R. Eliezer!</p></div>
<div class="indent1"><span class="nm">(d)</span><p><span class="cl">Answer #2 (Reish Lakish):</span> "Motza Sefasecha... Nadarta... Nedavah";</p></div>
<div class="indent2"><span class="nm">1.</span><p><span class="cl">Question:</span> Why does the Torah call a Neder 'Nedavah'?</p></div>
<div class="indent2"><span class="nm">2.</span><p><span class="cl">Answer:</span> If you did like you vowed, it is a Neder. If not, it is a Nedavah (it is Kosher, but you did not fulfill your vow).</p></div>
<div class="indent1"><span class="nm">(e)</span><p><span class="cl">Question (R. Zeira and R. Yitzchak bar Aba):</span> Reish Lakish was bothered, because an Asham is not brought after death. He learned from "Motza Sefasecha..." that (Lo Lishmah) it is Kosher, but it does not atone;</p></div>
<div class="indent2"><span class="nm">1.</span><p>He should learn from the verse only Korbanos due to vows (which the verse discusses). Asham (Lo Lishmah) should be totally Pasul!</p></div>
<div class="indent1"><span class="nm">(f)</span><p><span class="cl">Answer (Abaye):</span> Really, Reish Lakish learned that it is Kosher from "v'Shachat Osah l'Chatas" - only a Chatas is Pasul if slaughtered Lo Lishmah, but other Korbanos are Kosher;</p></div>
<div class="indent2"><span class="nm">1.</span><p>One might have thought that the Asham atones. He learned from "Motza Sefasecha..." that it does not.</p></div>
<div class="indent1"><span class="nm">(g)</span><p><span class="cl">Question:</span> "Motza Sefasecha" discusses Korbanos brought for vows. It should only teach that such Korbanos (Lo Lishmah) are Kosher but do not atone, but an Asham is Kosher and atones!</p></div>
<div class="indent1"><span class="nm">(h)</span><p><span class="cl">Answer #1 (Abaye):</span> A Kal va'Chomer teaches that Asham does not atone:</p></div>
<div class="indent2"><span class="nm">1.</span><p>An Olah (even Lishmah) is not brought for Kaparah (atonement. It is merely a gift.) Even so, if it was offered Lo Lishmah one was not Yotzei;</p></div>
<div class="indent2"><span class="nm">2.</span><p>An Asham (Lishmah) atones for a transgression. All the more so (if it was Lo Lishmah) one was not Yotzei!</p></div>
<div class="indent2"><span class="nm">3.</span><p><span class="cl">Question:</span> We cannot learn from Olah, because it is totally burned.</p></div>
<div class="indent2"><span class="nm">4.</span><p><span class="cl">Answer:</span> We learn from Shelamim. It is not brought for Kaparah, and if it was offered Lo Lishmah one was not Yotzei.</p></div>
<div class="indent2"><span class="nm">5.</span><p><span class="cl">Question:</span> We cannot learn from Shelamim, because it requires Nesachim, and Tenufah of the chest and foreleg.</p></div>
<div class="indent2"><span class="nm">6.</span><p><span class="cl">Answer:</span> We learn from Olah that these are not essential criteria;</p></div>
<div class="indent2"><span class="nm">7.</span><p><span class="cl">Conclusion:</span> Each has its own stringencies. The Tzad ha'Shavah (common side) of them is that they are Kodshim, and if offered Lo Lishmah they are Kosher, and one was not Yotzei. We learn the same about Asham.</p></div>
<div class="indent2"><span class="nm">8.</span><p><span class="cl">Objection:</span> We cannot learn from the Tzad ha'Shavah, because Olah and Shelamim are both brought for Korbanos Tzibur, but Asham is not!</p></div>
<div class="indent2"><span class="nm">9.</span><p><span class="cl">Answer:</span> We learn from Todah that this is not an essential criterion;</p></div>
<div class="bbbline">5b----------------------------------------5b</p></div>
<div class="indent2"><span class="nm">10.</span><p><span class="cl">Question:</span> We cannot learn from Todah, because bread must be brought with it!</p></div>
<div class="indent2"><span class="nm">11.</span><p><span class="cl">Answer:</span> We learn from Olah and Shelamim that this is not an essential criteria;</p></div>
<div class="indent3"><span class="nm">i.</span><p>We learn from the Tzad ha'Shavah of all three. They are Kodshim, and if offered Lo Lishmah they are Kosher, but one was not Yotzei. We learn the same about Asham.</p></div>
<div class="indent2"><span class="nm">12.</span><p><span class="cl">Objection:</span> We cannot learn from the Tzad ha'Shavah, because all of them are brought for vows, but Asham is not!</p></div>
<div class="indent1"><span class="nm">(i)</span><p><span class="cl">Answer #2 (Rava):</span> "Zos ha'Torah... vela'Asham... ul'Zevach ha'Shelamim" equates Asham to Shelamim. If it was offered Lo Lishmah it is Kosher, but one was not Yotzei.</p></div>
<div class="indent1"><span class="nm">(j)</span><p><span class="cl">Question:</span> Why equate it to Shelamim? Perhaps we equate it to Chatas (which is also in the verse) to teach that if it was offered Lo Lishmah it is Pasul!</p></div>
<div class="indent1"><span class="nm">(k)</span><p><span class="cl">Answer:</span> "V'Shachat Osah l'Chatas" - only a Chatas is Pasul if slaughtered Lo Lishmah. Other Korbanos are Kosher.</p></div>
<div class="subject"><span class="nm">2)</span><p>THE DIALOGUE BETWEEN REISH LAKISH AND REBBI ELAZAR</p></div>
<div class="indent1"><span class="nm">(a)</span><p><span class="cl">Question (Rav Huna and Rav Nachman):</span> Reish Lakish asked about Asham because it is not brought after the owner died. R. Elazar should have said that it is!</p></div>
<div class="indent2"><span class="nm">1.</span><p><span class="cl">Version #1 (our text) Objection (Rav Sheshes):</span> You refer to Mosar Asham (if the owner died, it grazes until it becomes blemished. We redeem it, and use the money to buy Kitz ha'Mizbe'ach (Olah offerings of the Tzibur to bring when the Mizbeach is idle);</p></div>
<div class="indent3"><span class="nm">i.</span><p>There is also a case of Mosar Chatas. (If two animals were separated for Acharayus (in case one will become Pasul, the other will be the Chatas).) If the first animal was offered properly, the other can be offered after death! (Just like Chatas (Lo Lishmah) is Pasul, even though it is sometimes brought after the owner died, also Asham!)</p></div>
<div class="indent2"><span class="nm">2.</span><p><span class="cl">Answer:</span> "(Chatas) Hu" - a Chatas Lo Lishmah is Pasul, even though Chatas is sometimes brought after the owner died. (There is no such verse regarding Asham.)</p></div>
<div class="indent2"><span class="nm">3.</span><p><span class="cl">Question:</span> Also regarding Asham it says "(Asham) Hu"!</p></div>
<div class="indent1"><span class="nm">(b)</span><p><span class="cl">Version #2 - Tosfos - Answer (Rav Sheshes):</span> You refer to Mosar Asham;</p></div>
<div class="indent2"><span class="nm">1.</span><p>There is also a case of Mosar Chatas. If the first animal was offered properly, the other can be offered after death;</p></div>
<div class="indent2"><span class="nm">2.</span><p>"(Chatas) Hu" - only Chatas Lo Lishmah is Pasul, and even though Chatas is sometimes brought after death.</p></div>
<div class="indent1"><span class="nm">(c)</span><p><span class="cl">Question:</span> Regarding Asham it says "(Asham) Hu." What does this teach (if not that Asham Lo Lishmah is Pasul)? (end of Version #2)</p></div>
<div class="indent1"><span class="nm">(d)</span><p><span class="cl">Answer:</span> That applies to after burning the Eimurim (Chelev, i.e. intestinal fats) on the Mizbeach;</p></div>
<div class="indent2"><span class="nm">1.</span><p>A Korban is not Pasul if the Eimurim are burned Lo Lishmah. Even if they are not burned at all, the Korban is Kosher!</p></div>
<div class="indent1"><span class="nm">(e)</span><p><span class="cl">Question:</span> (Granted, "Hu" does not teach that Asham Lo Lishmah is Pasul.) What does "Hu" teach?</p></div>
<div class="indent1"><span class="nm">(f)</span><p><span class="cl">Answer:</span> It teaches Rav Huna's law.</p></div>
<div class="indent2"><span class="nm">1.</span><p><span class="cl">(Rav Huna):</span> If an Asham (which cannot be offered, e.g. the owner offered a different animal for his Asham) was Nitak (given to a shepherd) to graze (until it becomes blemished, and to buy Olos Kitz ha'Mizbe'ach with its redemption money) and slaughtered Stam (without special intent), it is (an Olah, it is) Kosher.</p></div>
<div class="indent2"><span class="nm">2.</span><p><span class="cl">Inference:</span> Before Nituk, it may not be slaughtered! (R. Tam deletes this from the text.)</p></div>
<div class="indent2"><span class="nm">3.</span><p><span class="cl">Question:</span> What is the reason?</p></div>
<div class="indent2"><span class="nm">4.</span><p><span class="cl">Version #1 (Rashi) Answer:</span> "Hu" - it is in its original status (an Asham (until Nituk). An Asham that is not needed is Pasul.)</p></div>
<div class="indent2"><span class="nm">5.</span><p><span class="cl">Version #2 (Tosfos):</span> Answer: "Hu" - (mid'Oraisa) it is in its original status (Asham, until the owner offers a different Asham in its stead. Chachamim enacted not to slaughter it before Nituk, lest one slaughter it before a different Asham was offered).</p></div>
<div class="indent2"><span class="nm">6.</span><p><span class="cl">Version #3 (R. Tam):</span> Answer: "Hu" - it is (immediately) in its (ultimate) status (an Olah, mid'Oraisa. Mid'Rabanan, we do not offer it itself, rather it grazes...)</p></div>
<div class="indent1"><span class="nm">(g)</span><p><span class="cl">Question (Rav Nachman and Rav Sheshes):</span> R. Elazar said that Korbanos brought after death do not atone. Reish Lakish should have said that they do atone!</p></div>
<div class="indent1"><span class="nm">(h)</span><p><span class="cl">Answer (Rav Ada bar Masnah):</span> They do not atone. If a woman gave birth and died before bringing her Olah, the heirs bring it. It does not fulfill an obligation of theirs!</p></div>
<div class="indent1"><span class="nm">(i)</span><p><span class="cl">Question (Rav Asi):</span> Perhaps her Olah (even though it was brought for a birth) atones for Bitul (failure to fulfill a Mitzvas) Aseh. Just like it would have atoned for her, it atones for her heirs when they bring it!</p></div>
<div class="indent2"><span class="nm">1.</span><p><span class="cl">Inference:</span> The heirs acquire the Korban regarding Kaparah.</p></div>
<div class="subject"><span class="nm">3)</span><p>DO HEIRS ACQUIRE A <i>KORBAN</i>?</p></div>
<div class="indent1"><span class="nm">(a)</span><p><span class="cl">Question:</span> R. Yochanan taught that if two brothers inherited a Minchah, they offer it, and it is not considered a Minchah of partners;</p></div>
<div class="indent2"><span class="nm">1.</span><p>If heirs acquire a Korban regarding Kaparah, they are partners in it. It says "Nefesh" (one must bring a Minchah by himself)!</p></div>
<div class="indent2"><span class="nm">2.</span><p><span class="cl">Counter-question:</span> Can we say that heirs do not acquire a Korban regarding Kaparah?!</p></div>
<div class="indent3"><span class="nm">i.</span><p>R. Yochanan taught that if two brothers inherited an animal Korban, they offer it. Neither can make Temurah. (If he tries to transfer the Kedushah to a Chulin animal, it remains Chulin.)</p></div>
<div class="indent3"><span class="nm">ii.</span><p>We understand this if heirs acquire the Korban regarding Kaparah. It is like a jointly owned Korban, therefore they cannot make Temurah;</p></div>
<div class="indent3"><span class="nm">iii.</span><p>If they do not acquire it, Temurah should apply to it!</p></div>
<div class="indent2"><span class="nm">3.</span><p><span class="cl">Answer:</span> "V'Im Hamer Yamir" - the double expression teaches that an heir can make Temurah. The singular conjugation teaches that two heirs cannot.</p></div>
