<p class="bas subject"><span class="nm">1)</span>THOSE WHO TRANSGRESS A <i>LAV</i></p>
<p class="bas indent1"><span class="nm">(a)</span><span class="cl">(Beraisa):</span> If one did Avodah when he was an Arel, Onen or sitting, he transgressed a Lav, but he is not Chayav Misah,</p>
<p class="bas indent1"><span class="nm">(b)</span><span class="cl">Question:</span> What is the source for an Arel?</p>
<p class="bas indent1"><span class="nm">(c)</span><span class="cl">Answer (Rav Chisda):</span> We have no source from the Chumash. A verse in Yechezkeil alludes to it;</p>
<p class="bas indent2"><span class="nm">1.</span>"Kol Ben Nechar Erel Lev v'Erel Basar Lo Yavo El Mikdashi" (a Rasha or Arel may not enter the Mikdash).</p>
<p class="bas indent1"><span class="nm">(d)</span><span class="cl">Question:</span> What is the source for an Onen?</p>
<p class="bas indent1"><span class="nm">(e)</span><span class="cl">Answer:</span> "U'Min ha'Mikdash Lo Yetzei (a Kohen Gadol who became an Onen) v'Lo Yechalel Es Mikdash Elokav". This implies that if a regular Kohen was an Onen and served, he is Mechalel Avodah (this is forbidden by "v'Lo Yechalel").</p>
<p class="bas indent1"><span class="nm">(f)</span><span class="cl">Question (Rav Ada):</span> Why don't we learn a Gezerah Shavah "Chilul-Chilul" from a Tamei person who ate Terumah, who is Chayav Misah?</p>
<p class="bas indent1"><span class="nm">(g)</span><span class="cl">Answer (Rava):</span> Our verse discusses a Kohen Gadol. We <i>infer</i> the law of a regular Kohen. Something learned from inference we do not learn (more laws about it) from a Gezerah Shavah.</p>
<p class="bas indent1"><span class="nm">(h)</span><span class="cl">Question:</span> What is the source for one who sits?</p>
<p class="bas indent1"><span class="nm">(i)</span><span class="cl">Answer (Rava):</span> "Vo Bochar Hash-m... La'amod Leshares" - Kohanim were chosen to serve standing, and not sitting.</p>
<p class="bas indent1"><span class="nm">(j)</span><span class="cl">(Beraisa - Rebbi):</span> If a Ba'al Mum did Avodah he is Chayav Misah;</p>
<p class="bas indent1"><span class="nm">(k)</span>Chachamim say, he transgresses only a Lav.</p>
<p class="bas indent1"><span class="nm">(l)</span><span class="cl">Question:</span> What is Rebbi's reason?</p>
<p class="bas indent1"><span class="nm">(m)</span><span class="cl">Answer #1:</span> It says "Ach El ha'Paroches Lo Yavo (...v'Lo Yechalel)";</p>
<p class="bas indent2"><span class="nm">1.</span>He learns a Gezerah Shavah "Chilul-Chilul" from a Tamei person who ate Terumah, who is Chayav Misah.</p>
<p class="bas indent2"><span class="nm">2.</span><span class="cl">Question:</span> Why not learn "Chilul-Chilul" from Nosar, which is Chayavei Kerisus?</p>
<p class="bas indent2"><span class="nm">3.</span><span class="cl">Answer:</span> It is more reasonable to learn from a Tamei person who ate Terumah, for there also the Isur is due to the person.</p>
<p class="bas indent1"><span class="nm">(n)</span><span class="cl">Objection:</span> Rather, he should learn from Nosar, for this resembles a Ba'al Mum who did Avodah in the following ways:</p>
<p class="bas indent2"><span class="nm">1.</span>They pertain to Kodesh, they apply inside the Mikdash, Pigul applies to them, and Nosar applies to them.</p>
<p class="bas indent1"><span class="nm">(o)</span><span class="cl">Answer #2:</span> Rather, he learns "Chilul-Chilul" from Avodah b'Tum'ah. The Isur is due to the person (like Avodah of a Ba'al Mum), and it also has the similarities of Nosar.</p>
<p class="bas indent2"><span class="nm">1.</span>Chachamim expound "(u'Mesu) <i>Bo</i> (a Tamei who eats Terumah)", but there is no Misah for Avodah of a Ba'al Mum.</p>
<p class="bas indent1"><span class="nm">(p)</span><span class="cl">(Beraisa - Rebbi):</span> If someone intentionally transgresses Me'ilah he is Chayav Misah;</p>
<p class="bas indent1"><span class="nm">(q)</span>Chachamim say, he transgresses only a Lav.</p>
<p class="bas indent1"><span class="nm">(r)</span><span class="cl">Question:</span> What is Rebbi's reason?</p>
<p class="bas indent1"><span class="nm">(s)</span><span class="cl">Answer (R. Avahu):</span> He learns a Gezerah Shavah "Chet-Chet" from a Tamei person who ate Terumah, who is Chayav Misah;</p>
<p class="bas indent2"><span class="nm">1.</span>Chachamim expound "(u'Mesu) <i>Bo</i>", but there is no Misah for Me'ilah.</p>
<p class="bas subject"><span class="nm">2)</span>PUNISHMENT OF A <i>ZAR</i> WHO DID <i>AVODAH</i></p>
<p class="bas indent1"><span class="nm">(a)</span><span class="cl">(Beraisa):</span> A Zar who did Avodah in the Mikdash...</p>
<p class="bas indent1"><span class="nm">(b)</span><span class="cl">(Beraisa - R. Yishmael):</span> It says "veha'Zar ha'Karev Yumas", and it says (about Korach's congregation) "Kol ha'Karev... Yamus";</p>
<p class="bas indent2"><span class="nm">1.</span>Just like the latter died b'Yedei Shamayim, so is the punishment for a Zar who does Avodah.</p>
<p class="bas indent1"><span class="nm">(c)</span>R. Akiva says, it says "veha'Zar ha'Karev Yumas", and it says (about a false Navi) "veha'Navi... Yumas";</p>
<p class="bas indent2"><span class="nm">1.</span>Just like the latter is stoned, also a Zar who does Avodah.</p>
<p class="bas indent1"><span class="nm">(d)</span>R. Yochanan ben Nuri says, just like a false Navi is choked, also a Zar who does Avodah.</p>
<p class="bas indent1"><span class="nm">(e)</span><span class="cl">Question:</span> What do R. Yishmael and R. Akiva argue about?</p>
<p class="bas indent1"><span class="nm">(f)</span><span class="cl">Answer:</span> R. Akiva holds that it is better to learn "Yumas" from "Yumas", and not from "Yamus";</p>
<p class="bas indent2"><span class="nm">1.</span>R. Yishmael holds that it is better to learn laws of a commoner from a commoner, and not from a (false) Navi.</p>
<p class="bas indent2"><span class="nm">2.</span>R. Akiva says, a Navi who entices to idolatry is the ultimate commoner!</p>
<p class="bas indent1"><span class="nm">(g)</span><span class="cl">Question:</span> What do R. Akiva and R. Yochanan ben Nuri argue about?</p>
<p class="bas indent1"><span class="nm">(h)</span><span class="cl">Answer:</span> They argue as R. Shimon and Chachamim do:</p>
<p class="bas indent2"><span class="nm">1.</span><span class="cl">(Beraisa):</span> If a Navi enticed to idolatry, he is stoned;</p>
<p class="bas indent2"><span class="nm">2.</span>R. Shimon says, he is choked.</p>
<p class="bas indent1"><span class="nm">(i)</span><span class="cl">Contradiction (Mishnah - R. Akiva):</span> He is choked. (Here, R. Akiva says that he is stoned!)</p>
<p class="bas indent1"><span class="nm">(j)</span><span class="cl">Answer:</span> Tana'im argue about the opinion of R. Akiva. Our Mishnah is like R. Shimon. He says that R. Akiva holds (like himself) that he is choked;</p>
<p class="bas indent2"><span class="nm">1.</span>The Beraisa is Chachamim. They say that R. Akiva holds (like themselves) that he is stoned.</p>

<p class="perekline">PEREK ELU HEN HA'NICHNAKIN</p>
<p class="bas subject"><span class="nm">3)</span>THOSE WHO ARE PUNISHED WITH <i>CHENEK</i></p>
<p class="bas indent1"><span class="nm">(a)</span><span class="cl">(Mishnah):</span> The following are choked:</p>
<p class="bas indent2"><span class="nm">1.</span>One who wounds his father or mother;</p>
<p class="bas indent2"><span class="nm">2.</span>One who kidnaps a Yisrael;</p>
<p class="bas indent2"><span class="nm">3.</span>A Zaken Mamrei who rebels against Beis Din;</p>
<p class="bas indent2"><span class="nm">4.</span>A false Navi, or one who prophesizes in the name of idolatry;</p>
<p class="bas indent2"><span class="nm">5.</span>One who has Bi'ah with a married woman;</p>
<p class="bas indent2"><span class="nm">6.</span>Edim Zomemim who convicted a Bas Kohen for adultery, or one who had adultery with her (even though she is burned).</p>
<p class="bas indent1"><span class="nm">(b)</span><span class="cl">(Gemara) Question:</span> What is the source for one who wounds his father or mother?</p>
<p class="bas indent1"><span class="nm">(c)</span><span class="cl">Answer:</span> "U'Makeh Aviv v'Imo Mos Yumas" - any unspecified Misah is choking.</p>
<p class="bas indent1"><span class="nm">(d)</span><span class="cl">Question:</span> Perhaps that refers to killing a parent!</p>
<p class="bas indent1"><span class="nm">(e)</span><span class="cl">Answer #1:</span> That is unreasonable. One is beheaded for killing a stranger. We cannot say that one is choked for killing a parent!</p>
<p class="bas indent1"><span class="nm">(f)</span><span class="cl">Question:</span> That is according to Chachamim, who say that beheading is more severe. R. Shimon holds that choking is more severe. How can he answer?</p>
<p class="bas indent1"><span class="nm">(g)</span><span class="cl">Answer #2:</span> It says "Makeh Ish va'Mes Mos Yumas", and "Oh v'Eivah Hikahu v'Yado va'Yamos." The Torah needed to specify that he died. This shows that normally, 'Haka'ah' is not a death blow.</p>
<p class="bas indent1"><span class="nm">(h)</span>The Torah needed to write "Makeh Ish..." , and "Kol Makeh Nefesh":</p>
<p class="bas indent2"><span class="nm">1.</span>Had it wrote only "Makeh Ish", one might have thought that one is liable only for (killing) a man, who is obligated in the Mitzvos, but not for a minor. Therefore, it says "Kol Makeh Nefesh."</p>
<p class="bas indent2"><span class="nm">2.</span>Had it wrote only "Kol Makeh Nefesh", one might have thought that one is liable even for a Nefel (a baby born with a severe defect; it cannot survive), or a baby born after eight months (also it is a Nefel). Therefore, it says "Makeh Ish."</p>
<p class="bas indent1"><span class="nm">(i)</span><span class="cl">Question:</span> We should say that one is liable even if he did not make a wound (i.e. bleeding). but this is wrong!</p>
<p class="bas indent2"><span class="nm">1.</span><span class="cl">(Mishnah):</span> One who hits his father or mother is not liable unless he made a wound.</p>
<p class="bas indent1"><span class="nm">(j)</span><span class="cl">Answer #1:</span> "Makeh Adam... Makeh Vehemah" - just like one is not liable (to pay) for hitting an animal unless he made a wound, for it says 'Nefesh' (which is in the blood), one is not Chayav (Misah) for hitting a person (parent).</p>
<p class="bas indent1"><span class="nm">(k)</span><span class="cl">Rejection (R. Yirmeyah):</span> If so, if one weakens an animal (by overloading it) with rocks, he should be exempt!</p>
<p class="bas indent1"><span class="nm">(l)</span><span class="cl">Answer #2 (R. Yirmeyah):</span> Since 'Nefesh' does not teach that one is liable for hitting an animal only if he wounds it, for one is liable for weakening it with rocks, we use it to teach about hitting a person (parent).</p>
<p class="bas indent1"><span class="nm">(m)</span><span class="cl">Question:</span> What do we learn from the Hekesh equating hitting people and animals?</p>
<p class="bas indent1"><span class="nm">(n)</span><span class="cl">Answer #1:</span> We learn Tana d'Vei Chizkiyah's law (that one who transgressed Chayavei Misos b'Shogeg does not pay).</p>
<p class="bas indent1"><span class="nm">(o)</span><span class="cl">Question:</span> What do the other opinions (that argue with Tana d'Vei Chizkiyah) learn from the Hekesh?</p>
<p class="bas indent1"><span class="nm">(p)</span><span class="cl">Answer #2:</span> Just like one who wounds an animal for the sake of curing it is exempt, also regarding people.</p>
<p class="bas subject"><span class="nm">4)</span>WOUNDING A PARENT <i>B'SHOGEG</i></p>
<p class="bas indent1"><span class="nm">(a)</span><span class="cl">Question:</span> May a son let blood from his father?</p>
<p class="bas indent1"><span class="nm">(b)</span><span class="cl">Answer #1 (Rav Masnah):</span> "V'Ohavta l'Re'acha Kamocha" (since the father wants, it is permitted).</p>
<p class="bas indent1"><span class="nm">(c)</span><span class="cl">Answer #2 (Rav Dimi bar Chinena):</span> It says "Makeh Adam... Makeh Vehemah" - just like one who wounds an animal for the sake of curing it is exempt, also regarding people.</p>
<p class="bas indent1"><span class="nm">(d)</span>Rav would not allow his son to remove a thorn from him (lest he draw blood).</p>
<p class="bas indent1"><span class="nm">(e)</span>Mar brei d'Ravina would not let his son to open a blister to extract the puss, lest he draw blood (b'Shogeg), which is forbidden.</p>
<p class="bas indent1"><span class="nm">(f)</span><span class="cl">Question:</span> If so, he should not allow anyone to do so!</p>
<p class="bas indent1"><span class="nm">(g)</span><span class="cl">Answer:</span> Anyone else would transgress a Lav b'Shogeg. His son would be Shogeg in a Lav of Misah.</p>
<p class="bas indent1"><span class="nm">(h)</span><span class="cl">Question (Mishnah):</span> A small needle may be moved on Shabbos in order to remove a thorn.</p>
<p class="bas indent2"><span class="nm">1.</span>If one draws blood, he was Shogeg in a Lav punished by stoning!</p>
<p class="bas indent1"><span class="nm">(i)</span><span class="cl">Answer #1:</span> There he is Mekalkel (destructive), which is exempt (regarding Shabbos).</p>
<p class="bas indent1"><span class="nm">(j)</span><span class="cl">Question:</span> This is like the opinion that exempts Mekalkel (even if done intentionally);</p>
<p class="bas indent2"><span class="nm">1.</span>According to the opinion that obligates, how can we answer?</p>
<p class="bas indent1"><span class="nm">(k)</span><span class="cl">Answer:</span> R. Shimon obligates. He exempts for a Melachah she'Einah Tzericha l'Gufah (a Melachah done for a reason unrelated to the purpose of the Melachah in the Mishkan ).</p>
