<p class="bas subject"><span class="nm">1)</span>DO WITNESSES CAUSE PUBLICITY?</p>
<p class="bas indent1"><span class="nm">(a)</span><span class="cl">Answer:</span> (Really, witnesses do not cause publicity.) There, the buyers caused their own loss. (Had they researched well, they would have found out about the sale.)</p>
<p class="bas indent1"><span class="nm">(b)</span><span class="cl">Question:</span> Did Rav really say that one who bought without a document may collect from sold property?!</p>
<p class="bas indent2"><span class="nm">1.</span><span class="cl">(Mishnah):</span> One who lent money with a document may collect from sold property; if he lent without a document, he only collects from unsold property. (The laws of a sale and a loan should be the same, it depends whether or not witnesses publicize things.)</p>
<p class="bas indent2"><span class="nm">2.</span><span class="cl">Suggestion:</span> Perhaps Rav argues with the Mishnah, for he is a Tana.</p>
<p class="bas indent2"><span class="nm">3.</span><span class="cl">Rejection (Rav and Shmuel):</span> One who lent money without a document may not collect from heirs or from sold property.</p>
<p class="bas indent1"><span class="nm">(c)</span><span class="cl">Answer:</span> Loans and sales are different.</p>
<p class="bas indent2"><span class="nm">1.</span>A person borrows discreetly (and asks the witnesses not to publicize it), lest his property decline in value (if people would know that he needs money);</p>
<p class="bas indent2"><span class="nm">2.</span>A person announces when he sells land, so that potential buyers will hear.</p>
<p class="bas subject"><span class="nm">2)</span>JOINT CHAZAKAH</p>
<p class="bas indent1"><span class="nm">(a)</span><span class="cl">(Beraisa):</span> If Reuven used a field for a year, and his son used it for two years, or vice-versa, or each used it for a year and a buyer used it the third year, this is a Chazakah.</p>
<p class="bas indent1"><span class="nm">(b)</span><span class="cl">Inference:</span> One who buys from an heir can make a Chazakah.</p>
<p class="bas indent1"><span class="nm">(c)</span><span class="cl">Contradiction (Beraisa):</span> Shimon used (what was Muchzak to be) Levi's field for three years, uncontested. Levi died after the first or second year. If Levi's son Kehas (who stood to inherit the field) did nothing, or he sold it one year after Levi's death (and the buyer was quiet in the third year), Shimon has a Chazakah.</p>
<p class="bas indent2"><span class="nm">1.</span>If one who buys from an heir can make a Chazakah, we must say that there is publicity to a sale. If so, when Kehas sold it, this should be considered a Macha'ah!</p>
<p class="bas indent1"><span class="nm">(d)</span><span class="cl">Answer (Rav Papa):</span> The Beraisa discusses when Kehas wrote a document selling all his fields. (Shimon did not know that he contests the field, therefore it was not a Macha'ah.)</p>
<p class="bas subject"><span class="nm">3)</span>CHAZAKAH OF PARTNERS</p>
<p class="bas indent1"><span class="nm">(a)</span><span class="cl">(Mishnah):</span> Craftsmen, partners, sharecroppers, and overseers cannot make a Chazakah (in property they work on, share or oversee);</p>
<p class="bas indent1"><span class="nm">(b)</span>A man cannot make a Chazakah in his wife's property, nor vice-versa. A father cannot make a Chazakah in his son's property, or vice-versa.</p>
<p class="bas indent1"><span class="nm">(c)</span>This refers to Chazakah to prove ownership;</p>
<p class="bas indent2"><span class="nm">1.</span>Locking the fence, fencing or breaching any amount in a wall is a Chazakah to acquire a gift, to divide an inheritance, or to acquire Hefker property.</p>
<p class="bas bbbline">42b----------------------------------------42b</p>
<p class="bas indent1"><span class="nm">(d)</span><span class="cl">(Gemara - Shmuel's father and Levi):</span> The Mishnah does not mention a craftsman. We learn (that he cannot get a Chazakah) from a Kal va'Chomer from a partner.</p>
<p class="bas indent1"><span class="nm">(e)</span><span class="cl">(Shmuel):</span> The Mishnah says that a craftsman does not get a Chazakah, but a partner may.</p>
<p class="bas indent2"><span class="nm">1.</span>This is like Shmuel taught elsewhere.</p>
<p class="bas indent2"><span class="nm">2.</span><span class="cl">(Shmuel):</span> A partner can make a Chazakah against his partner, he can testify for him (we shall explain when), and he is considered a Shomer Sachar when watching the common property.</p>
<p class="bas indent1"><span class="nm">(f)</span><span class="cl">Question (R. Aba):</span> Did Shmuel really say that a partner can make a Chazakah?!</p>
<p class="bas indent2"><span class="nm">1.</span><span class="cl">Contradiction (Shmuel):</span> A partner is like one who uses another's field with permission.</p>
<p class="bas indent2"><span class="nm">2.</span><span class="cl">Suggestion:</span> This teaches that he cannot make a Chazakah.</p>
<p class="bas indent1"><span class="nm">(g)</span><span class="cl">Answer #1 (Rav Yehudah):</span> Shmuel's teachings apply to two different cases, when he makes a Chazakah in the entire property, and when he makes Chazakah in half (and claims that they agreed that he will receive this half).</p>
<p class="bas indent2"><span class="nm">1.</span>This can be understood either way.</p>
<p class="bas indent3"><span class="nm">i.</span><span class="cl">Version #1:</span> A Chazakah in the entire property is valid. One would not allow his partner to use the entire field for three straight years. Surely he sold his share;</p>
<p class="bas indent3"><span class="nm">ii.</span>A Chazakah in half the property is invalid, for it is normal for each partner to use the same half for several years, and then they switch.</p>
<p class="bas indent3"><span class="nm">iii.</span><span class="cl">Version #2:</span> A Chazakah in the entire property is invalid, for it is normal for a partner to let the other use the entire field for three years, and then he will get it for three years;</p>
<p class="bas indent3"><span class="nm">iv.</span>A Chazakah in half the property is valid. Had they not divided, and they wanted to share the fruits every year, they would work the entire field together.</p>
<p class="bas indent1"><span class="nm">(h)</span><span class="cl">Answer #2 (Ravina):</span> In both cases he made a Chazakah in the entire property;</p>
<p class="bas indent2"><span class="nm">1.</span>If the field is destined to be divided (it is big enough for each to get a field of proper size), the Chazakah is valid, for one would not allow his partner to use the entire field for three straight years;</p>
<p class="bas indent2"><span class="nm">2.</span>If the field is not destined to be divided, the Chazakah is invalid. It is normal to allow a partner to use the same half for several years, and then switch.</p>
<p class="bas indent1"><span class="nm">(i)</span><span class="cl">(Shmuel):</span> A partner is like one who uses another's field with permission.</p>
<p class="bas indent1"><span class="nm">(j)</span><span class="cl">Question:</span> If Shmuel's Chidush is that he cannot make a Chazakah, he should say this explicitly!</p>
<p class="bas indent1"><span class="nm">(k)</span><span class="cl">Answer (Rabah bar Avuha):</span> He teaches that he receives Peros that are Magi'a l'Kesafim (Rashbam - ready to harvest; R. Tam - they came through exertion).</p>
