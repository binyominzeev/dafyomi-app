<p class="bas subject"><span class="nm">1)</span>CONTRADICTORY TESTIMONY</p>
<p class="bas indent1"><span class="nm">(a)</span><span class="cl">(Chachamim of Neharde'a):</span> Even if they argue about the color of the coins, the testimony is valid.</p>
<p class="bas indent1"><span class="nm">(b)</span><span class="cl">Suggestion:</span> This is like R. Yehoshua ben Korchah.</p>
<p class="bas indent1"><span class="nm">(c)</span><span class="cl">Rejection:</span> We know that R. Yehoshua ben Korchah joins testimonies only when they do not contradict each other. We have no source that he joins in this case!</p>
<p class="bas indent1"><span class="nm">(d)</span>Rather, Chachamim of Neharde'a hold like the following Tana;</p>
<p class="bas indent2"><span class="nm">1.</span><span class="cl">(Beraisa - R. Shimon ben Elazar):</span> Beis Hillel and Beis Shamai agree that if one pair of witnesses says that Reuven owes 100, and the other says that he owes 200, he must pay 100 (for all agree that he owes at least 100);</p>
<p class="bas indent2"><span class="nm">2.</span>They argue in a case that one witness says 100, and the other says 200. Beis Shamai consider this contradictory testimony (and Reuven is exempt). Beis Hillel obligate him to pay 100.</p>
<p class="bas indent1"><span class="nm">(e)</span>A case occurred in which one witness said that Reuven owed a barrel of wine, and one said that he owed a barrel of oil. R. Ami made Reuven pay a barrel of wine (which is worth less than oil).</p>
<p class="bas indent1"><span class="nm">(f)</span><span class="cl">Suggestion:</span> This is like R. Shimon ben Elazar.</p>
<p class="bas indent1"><span class="nm">(g)</span><span class="cl">Objection:</span> R. Shimon ben Elazar obligated in a case of 100 and 200., for 100 is included in 200. We have no source to say that he obligates regarding wine and oil!</p>
<p class="bas indent1"><span class="nm">(h)</span><span class="cl">Answer:</span> The case is, the witnesses argued about whether he owed <i>the value of</i> a barrel of wine or of oil.</p>
<p class="bas indent1"><span class="nm">(i)</span>A case occurred in which one witness said that Reuven borrowed money from Shimon on the top floor, and one said that he borrowed on the bottom floor. Rebbi joined the testimonies (like Rav Yehudah).</p>
<p class="bas indent1"><span class="nm">(j)</span><span class="cl">(Mishnah) Question:</span> What is the source that when they leave...</p>
<p class="bas indent1"><span class="nm">(k)</span><span class="cl">(Beraisa) Question:</span> What is the source that afterwards, a judge may not tell Ploni 'I wanted to acquit you, but they outnumbered me'?</p>
<p class="bas indent1"><span class="nm">(l)</span><span class="cl">Answer:</span> It says "Lo Selech Rachil b'Amecha" and "Holech Rachil Megaleh Sod."</p>
<p class="bas indent1"><span class="nm">(m)</span>Once, a matter was said in the Beis Medrash, and it became known that a certain Talmid revealed it 22 years later. R. Ami expelled him from the Beis Medrash, and announced 'this person reveals secrets.'</p>
<p class="bas subject"><span class="nm">2)</span>BRINGING A PROOF LATER</p>
<p class="bas indent1"><span class="nm">(a)</span><span class="cl">(Mishnah):</span> If a party later brings a proof, it overturns the verdict.</p>
<p class="bas indent1"><span class="nm">(b)</span>If Reuven was told to bring his proofs within 30 days, and he found proof within 30 days, it overturns the verdict;</p>
<p class="bas indent2"><span class="nm">1.</span>If he found proof after 30 days, it does not overturn the verdict;</p>
<p class="bas indent2"><span class="nm">2.</span>R. Shimon ben Gamliel says, what should he have done? He did not find until after 30 days! (Therefore, it overturns the verdict.)</p>
<p class="bas indent1"><span class="nm">(c)</span>If Reuven was told to bring witnesses or a proof, and he said that he does not have; if he later finds witnesses or a proof, he may not use them;</p>
<p class="bas indent1"><span class="nm">(d)</span>R. Shimon ben Gamliel says, what should he have done? He did not know at the time! (Therefore, he may use them.)</p>
<p class="bas indent2"><span class="nm">1.</span>If he saw that he was going to lose the case, and said 'Ploni and Almoni, come to testify!', or he pulled a proof out of his belt, it is invalid.</p>
<p class="bas indent1"><span class="nm">(e)</span><span class="cl">(Gemara - Rabah bar Rav Huna):</span> The Halachah follows R. Shimon ben Gamliel (in the first law).</p>
<p class="bas indent1"><span class="nm">(f)</span><span class="cl">(Rabah bar Rav Huna):</span> The Halachah does not follow Chachamim.</p>
<p class="bas indent1"><span class="nm">(g)</span><span class="cl">Objection:</span> Since the Halachah follows R. Shimon, obviously it does not follow Chachamim!</p>
<p class="bas indent1"><span class="nm">(h)</span><span class="cl">Answer:</span> One might have thought that l'Chatchilah we follow R. Shimon, but if a judge ruled like Chachamim his verdict stands. Rabah teaches that this is not so.</p>
<p class="bas indent1"><span class="nm">(i)</span><span class="cl">(Mishnah):</span> Reuven was told to bring witnesses... R. Shimon ben Gamliel says...</p>
<p class="bas indent1"><span class="nm">(j)</span><span class="cl">(Rabah bar Rav Huna):</span> The Halachah follows Chachamim.</p>
<p class="bas indent1"><span class="nm">(k)</span><span class="cl">(Rabah bar Rav Huna citing R. Yochanan):</span> The Halachah does not follow R. Shimon ben Gamliel.</p>
<p class="bas indent1"><span class="nm">(l)</span><span class="cl">Objection:</span> Since the Halachah follows Chachamim, obviously it does not follow R. Shimon!</p>
<p class="bas indent1"><span class="nm">(m)</span><span class="cl">Answer:</span> He teaches that in this law, the Halachah does not follow R. Shimon ben Gamliel, but in <i>all</i> other Mishnayos, the Halachah follows him; he argues with Rabah bar bar Chanah;</p>
<p class="bas indent2"><span class="nm">1.</span><span class="cl">(Rabah bar bar Chanah citing R. Yochanan):</span> The Halachah follows R. Shimon ben Gamliel in all Mishnayos, except for three: the Mishnah of an Arev, the Get in Tzidon, and the litigant who found a proof after he said that he does not have one.</p>
<p class="bas indent1"><span class="nm">(n)</span>A child was summonsed to judgment in front of Rav Nachman. He was asked if he has witnesses or a proof, and he said that he does not. Rav Nachman obligated him, and the child left crying. (Tosfos - sometimes, we force minors to pay.)</p>
<p class="bas indent2"><span class="nm">1.</span>Ploni and Almoni heard about this. They came and said 'we know about his father's affairs'!</p>
<p class="bas indent2"><span class="nm">2.</span><span class="cl">Rav Nachman:</span> Even Chachamim admit in this case, for a child does not know about his father's affairs.</p>
<p class="bas subject"><span class="nm">3)</span>A THIRD PARTY HOLDING A DOCUMENT</p>
<p class="bas indent1"><span class="nm">(a)</span>A woman was holding a document (the lender and borrower entrusted her with it). She said 'I know that it was paid.'</p>
<p class="bas indent1"><span class="nm">(b)</span><span class="cl">Version #1:</span> Rav Nachman acted according to her words.</p>
<p class="bas indent1"><span class="nm">(c)</span><span class="cl">Question (Rava):</span> Is this like Rebbi, who says that a document is acquired by handing it over (therefore, it is like hers, and she is believed about it)?</p>
<p class="bas indent1"><span class="nm">(d)</span><span class="cl">Answer (Rav Nachman):</span> It is even like Chachamim. She is believed because she could have burned the document if she wanted.</p>
<p class="bas indent1"><span class="nm">(e)</span><span class="cl">Version #2:</span> Rav Nachman did not believe her.</p>
<p class="bas indent1"><span class="nm">(f)</span><span class="cl">Question (Rava):</span> She should be believed, for she could have burned the document if she wanted!</p>
<p class="bas bbbline">31b----------------------------------------31b</p>
<p class="bas indent1"><span class="nm">(g)</span><span class="cl">Answer (Rav Nachman):</span> Once a document has been seen in Beis Din, one is not believed (to disqualify it) Migo (since) he could have burned it.</p>
<p class="bas indent1"><span class="nm">(h)</span><span class="cl">Question (Rava - Beraisa):</span> A signed receipt is validated through the signatures;</p>
<p class="bas indent2"><span class="nm">1.</span>If it has no witnesses, and a third party holds it, or it is written on the loan document below the signatures, it is valid.</p>
<p class="bas indent2"><span class="nm">2.</span>If a third party holds it, it is valid (the third party is believed, even though Beis Din saw the document).</p>
<p class="bas indent2"><span class="nm">3.</span>If it is written on the loan document below the signatures, it is valid (the lender would not allow them to taint his document unless he was really paid).</p>
<p class="bas indent1"><span class="nm">(i)</span>Rav Nachman is refuted.</p>
<p class="bas subject"><span class="nm">4)</span>BRINGING A PROOF LATER</p>
<p class="bas indent1"><span class="nm">(a)</span><span class="cl">(Rav Dimi citing R. Yochanan):</span> One can always bring proofs, until he seals his claim (he says that he has no more proofs) and then says 'Ploni and Almoni, come testify for me!'</p>
<p class="bas indent1"><span class="nm">(b)</span><span class="cl">Objection:</span> The Reisha is like Chachamim (once he seals his claim, he cannot bring <i>any</i> proof), and the Seifa is like R. Shimon ben Gamliel (he cannot bring a proof that he had from the beginning, e.g. 'Ploni and Almoni, come testify for me!', but if he later finds a proof, he can bring it)!</p>
<p class="bas indent2"><span class="nm">1.</span><span class="cl">Suggestion:</span> The entire teaching is like R. Shimon ben Gamliel. The Seifa explains the Reisha. 'Sealing his claim' is saying 'Ploni and Almoni, come testify for me!'</p>
<p class="bas indent2"><span class="nm">2.</span><span class="cl">Rejection:</span> R. Yochanan said that the Halachah does not follow R. Shimon ben Gamliel in this case!</p>
<p class="bas indent1"><span class="nm">(c)</span><span class="cl">(Rav Shmuel bar Yehudah citing R. Yochanan):</span> One can always bring proofs, until he says that he has no more witnesses or proofs;</p>
<p class="bas indent2"><span class="nm">1.</span>If witnesses come from overseas, or if his father's documents were deposited with someone else, he may use them to overturn the verdict.</p>
<p class="bas subject"><span class="nm">5)</span>WHO DECIDES WHERE THEY WILL BE JUDGED</p>
<p class="bas indent1"><span class="nm">(a)</span><span class="cl">(Rav Dimi citing R. Yochanan):</span> If Reuven was an overbearing litigant, and he wanted to take Shimon to a local Beis Din, Shimon may insist that they go to the Beis ha'Va'ad (where there are great Chachamim, and Reuven will be embarrassed in front of them).</p>
<p class="bas indent1"><span class="nm">(b)</span><span class="cl">Objection (R. Elazar):</span> If Shimon owes 100 Zuz to Reuven, must Reuven spend 100 Zuz travelling to the Beis ha'Va'ad?!</p>
<p class="bas indent1"><span class="nm">(c)</span><span class="cl">(R. Elazar):</span> Rather, Reuven can force Shimon to go to a Beis Din in their city.</p>
<p class="bas indent1"><span class="nm">(d)</span><span class="cl">(Rav Safra):</span> If Levi and Yehudah were quarreling, and Levi wants to go to a local Beis Din, and Yehudah wants to go to the Beis ha'Va'ad, Levi can force him to be judged here;</p>
<p class="bas indent2"><span class="nm">1.</span>If the local Beis Din does not know the law, they will (send a message and) ask the Beis ha'Va'ad.</p>
<p class="bas indent2"><span class="nm">2.</span>If a litigant asks to know the reason for the verdict, they write it for him.</p>
<p class="bas indent2"><span class="nm">3.</span>A Yevamah goes to the Yavam to do Chalitzah.</p>
<p class="bas indent1"><span class="nm">(e)</span><span class="cl">Question:</span> How far does her obligation extend?</p>
<p class="bas indent1"><span class="nm">(f)</span><span class="cl">Answer (R. Ami):</span> She must go even from Tiverya to Tzipori (even though Tiverya has a greater Beis Din).</p>
<p class="bas indent1"><span class="nm">(g)</span><span class="cl">(Rav Kahana):</span> He learns from "v'Kor'u Lo Ziknei Ir<i>o</i> (of his city)", not the Zekenim of her city.</p>
<p class="bas indent1"><span class="nm">(h)</span><span class="cl">(Ameimar):</span> The Halachah is, we force him to go to the Beis ha'Va'ad.</p>
<p class="bas indent1"><span class="nm">(i)</span><span class="cl">Question (Rav Ashi):</span> R. Elazar taught that he can force him to go to a Beis Din in their city!</p>
<p class="bas indent1"><span class="nm">(j)</span><span class="cl">Answer:</span> The lender can force the borrower (whether he wants to be judged here or in the Beis ha'Va'ad) - "v'Eved Loveh l'Ish Malveh."</p>
<p class="bas indent1"><span class="nm">(k)</span><span class="cl">The Beis Din of Tiverya sent to Mar Ukva (in Bavel):</span> Ukvan (of Bavel) claims that his brother Yirmeyah castrated him (some say - monetarily cheated him). Tell him (Yirmeyah) to come to you for judgment, and force him be judged (here) in Tiverya.</p>
<p class="bas indent1"><span class="nm">(l)</span><span class="cl">Question:</span> 'Tell him' implies that Mar Ukva should judge him. 'Force him to be judged in Tiverya' implies that Mar Ukva should send him here!</p>
<p class="bas indent1"><span class="nm">(m)</span><span class="cl">Answer #1:</span> They told him, you should judge him (there). If he does not listen, persuade him to come before us in Tiverya.</p>
<p class="bas indent1"><span class="nm">(n)</span><span class="cl">Answer #2 (Rav Ashi):</span> It was a case of a fine, which we do not judge in Bavel;</p>
<p class="bas indent2"><span class="nm">1.</span>They sent to Mar Ukva (even though he could not judge it) to show honor to him.</p>
