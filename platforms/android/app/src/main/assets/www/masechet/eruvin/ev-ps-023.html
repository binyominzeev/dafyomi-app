<div class="indent1"><span class="nm">(a)</span><p><span class="cl">(Gemara - Rav Yosef):</span> The Halachah follows R. Yehudah ben Bava.</p></div>
<div class="indent1"><span class="nm">(b)</span><p><span class="cl">(Rav Yosef):</span> Pasim permit only a well of flowing water.</p></div>
<div class="indent1"><span class="nm">(c)</span><p>He needed to teach both of these;</p></div>
<div class="indent2"><span class="nm">1.</span><p>Had he taught only that the Halachah follows R. Yehudah ben Bava, one might have thought that even a public pit of gathered water is permitted;</p></div>
<div class="indent3"><span class="nm">i.</span><p>We would say that R. Yehudah taught a public <i>well</i> in order to argue with R. Akiva [who permits even a private well].</p></div>
<div class="indent3"><span class="nm">ii.</span><p>Therefore, he also needed to teach that only a well of flowing water is permitted.</p></div>
<div class="indent2"><span class="nm">2.</span><p>Had he taught only that only a well of flowing water is permitted, one might have thought this is even if it is private. Therefore he needed to teach that the Halachah follows R. Yehudah ben Bava.</p></div>
<div class="subject"><span class="nm">2)</span><p>CONDITIONS FOR CARRYING IN A GARDEN OR KARFEF</p></div>
<div class="indent1"><span class="nm">(a)</span><p><span class="cl">(Mishnah):</span> R. Yehudah ben Bava taught further, that if a garden or Karfef 70 Amos and a fraction by 70 Amos and a fraction is surrounded by a fence 10 Tefachim tall, one may carry inside, as long as there is a watchman's shack or Beis Dirah inside, or it is close to the city. (Rashi - since it is close, he intends to use it often, it is Hukaf l'Dirah. This permits up to Beis Sa'atayim. Most Rishonim explain that a shack or Dirah [built <i>after</i> the garden was surrounded] permits up to Beis Sa'atayim, but if it was Hukaf l'Dirah (a proper Dirah was there first), a garden of any size is permitted.)</p></div>
<div class="indent1"><span class="nm">(b)</span><p>R. Yehudah says, even if there is only a pit or cave inside, one may carry inside;</p></div>
<div class="indent1"><span class="nm">(c)</span><p>R. Akiva says, even if none of these is inside one may carry inside, as long as it is [no more than] 70 Amos and a fraction on each side (this will be explained);</p></div>
<div class="indent1"><span class="nm">(d)</span><p>R. Eliezer says, [if it was not Hukaf l'Dirah,] if its length exceeds the width, even by one Amah, one may not carry inside [more than four Amos];</p></div>
<div class="indent1"><span class="nm">(e)</span><p>R. Yosi says, even if the length is twice the width, one may carry inside;</p></div>
<div class="indent1"><span class="nm">(f)</span><p>R. Ila'i says, R. Eliezer permits up to a Beis Kor.</p></div>
<div class="indent1"><span class="nm">(g)</span><p>R. Ila'i says, R. Eliezer says that if one forgot to give towards the Eruv in the Chatzer [and on Shabbos he was Mevatel (ceded his ownership) to the Bnei Chatzer], his house is forbidden to him (to transfer between it and the Chatzer), but it is permitted for the Bnei Chatzer [to transfer between their houses and his, via the Chatzer];</p></div>
<div class="indent1"><span class="nm">(h)</span><p>R. Ila'i says, R. Eliezer says that one fulfils the Mitzvah [of Maror] with Arkavlin (palm-ivy);</p></div>
<div class="indent1"><span class="nm">(i)</span><p><span class="cl">R. Ila'i:</span> I did not find anyone else who heard these Halachos from R. Eliezer.</p></div>
<div class="indent1"><span class="nm">(j)</span><p><span class="cl">(Gemara) Question:</span> It says 'R. Yehudah ben Bava taught <i>further'</i>. To which previous teaching does he add?</p></div>
<div class="indent2"><span class="nm">1.</span><p><span class="cl">Suggestion:</span> It says this because he was stringent in the previous Mishnah, and also in this one.</p></div>
<div class="indent2"><span class="nm">2.</span><p><span class="cl">Objection:</span> Earlier (18a), also R. Yehudah was stringent (he permits only up to Beis Sa'atayim within Pasei Bira'os), and again in the following Mishnah (22a, if Reshus ha'Rabim passes through the Pasim, he requires diverting it), yet it does not say that he taught 'further'!</p></div>
<div class="indent2"><span class="nm">3.</span><p><span class="cl">Answer:</span> There, it does not say 'further' because Chachamim taught laws in between. Here, there is no interruption between R. Yehudah ben Bava's two laws.</p></div>
<div class="indent2"><span class="nm">4.</span><p><span class="cl">Question:</span> It is not true that whenever Chachamim interrupt, it does not say 'further'!</p></div>
<div class="indent3"><span class="nm">i.</span><p>In Maseches Sukah (27a) R. Eliezer taught two laws, and even though Chachamim interrupt, it says R. Eliezer taught 'further!'</p></div>
<div class="indent2"><span class="nm">5.</span><p><span class="cl">Answer:</span> There, Chachamim interrupt regarding the same matter. (R. Eliezer requires eating 14 meals in the Sukah. Chachamim say that there is no fixed number.) Here, Chachamim interrupt R. Yehudah to discuss a new matter (a garden or Karfef...)</p></div>
<div class="indent1"><span class="nm">(k)</span><p><span class="cl">(Mishnah - R. Akiva):</span> Even if none of these is inside one may carry inside [as long as it is no more than 70 Amos and a fraction on each side].</p></div>
<div class="bbbline">23b----------------------------------------23b</p></div>
<div class="indent1"><span class="nm">(l)</span><p><span class="cl">Question:</span> R. Akiva does not argue with the first Tana! (R. Chananel - R. Akiva and R. Yehudah ben Bava both allow 70 Amos and a fraction. Rashi - R. Akiva and Chachamim (18a) both permit more than Beis Sa'atayim in an area Hukaf l'Dirah.)</p></div>
<div class="indent1"><span class="nm">(m)</span><p><span class="cl">Answer:</span> They argue about a small excess [over 70 Amos and four Tefachim]:</p></div>
<div class="indent2"><span class="nm">1.</span><p><span class="cl">(Beraisa - R. Yehudah):</span> There is a small excess [above 70 Amos and a fraction]. Chachamim did not say how much it is. (This will be explained.)</p></div>
<div class="indent2"><span class="nm">2.</span><p><span class="cl">Question:</span> How big is Beis Sa'atayim?</p></div>
<div class="indent2"><span class="nm">3.</span><p><span class="cl">Answer:</span> It is the area of Chatzer ha'Mishkan (50 by 100 Amos).</p></div>
<div class="indent1"><span class="nm">(n)</span><p><span class="cl">Question:</span> What is the source of this [that we use Chatzer ha'Mishkan to gauge Beis Sa'atayim? <a href=ev-ps-appendix.htm#14>See note 14 in Appendix</a>.]</p></div>
<div class="indent1"><span class="nm">(o)</span><p><span class="cl">Answer (Rav Yehudah):</span> "Orech he'Chatzer Me'ah va'Amah v'Rochav <i>Chamishim ba'Chamishim</i>" - the Torah teaches to take [a square of 50 by] 50 Amos and surround it with [another square of] 50 Amos [cut into strips. We surround it only with strips of a whole number of Amos or Tefachim (see Perush Chai diagram, Perek 2 number 60, in the <a href=../chai/eruv-2chai060.jpg>English Charts</a> section). We can make a square 70 Amos and four Tefachim and a small remainder. R. Akiva allows only this size [without the remainder], and the first Tana allows a full Beis Sa'atayim.]</p></div>
<div class="indent1"><span class="nm">(p)</span><p><span class="cl">Question:</span> What is the simple meaning of the verse?</p></div>
<div class="indent1"><span class="nm">(q)</span><p><span class="cl">Answer: (Abaye):</span> The Mishkan should be at the end of 50 Amos (half the length of the Chatzer), in order that there will be 50 Amos in front of [the opening to] it, and 20 Amos surrounding [its interior] on the other three sides.</p></div>
<div class="subject"><span class="nm">3)</span><p>THE SHAPE OF A GARDEN OR KARFEF THAT IS PERMITTED</p></div>
<div class="indent1"><span class="nm">(a)</span><p><span class="cl">(Mishnah - R. Eliezer):</span> If the length [exceeds the width, even by one Amah, one may not carry inside].</p></div>
<div class="indent1"><span class="nm">(b)</span><p><span class="cl">Contradiction (Beraisa - R. Eliezer):</span> If the length exceeds twice the width, even by one Amah, one may not carry inside.</p></div>
<div class="indent1"><span class="nm">(c)</span><p><span class="cl">Resolution (Rav Bivi bar Abaye):</span> Also the Mishnah should say 'If the length exceeds twice the width...'</p></div>
<div class="indent1"><span class="nm">(d)</span><p><span class="cl">Question:</span> If so, R. Yosi does not argue with R. Eliezer!</p></div>
<div class="indent1"><span class="nm">(e)</span><p><span class="cl">Answer:</span> They argue about whether or not l'Chatchilah it should be square. (R. Eliezer holds that l'Chatchilah the length should be twice the width, like the Mishkan. R. Yosi permits <i>even</i> if the length is twice the width. This connotes that l'Chatchilah, it should be square.)</p></div>
<div class="indent1"><span class="nm">(f)</span><p><span class="cl">(Mishnah - R. Yosi):</span> [Even if the length...]</p></div>
<div class="indent1"><span class="nm">(g)</span><p><span class="cl">(Rav Yosef citing Shmuel):</span> The Halachah follows R. Yosi.</p></div>
<div class="indent1"><span class="nm">(h)</span><p><span class="cl">(Rav Bivi citing Shmuel):</span> The Halachah follows R. Akiva.</p></div>
<div class="indent1"><span class="nm">(i)</span><p>Both of these teach a leniency. Shmuel needed to teach both of them;</p></div>
<div class="indent2"><span class="nm">1.</span><p>Had he taught only that the Halachah follows R. Yosi, one might have thought that there must be a watchman's shack or Beis Dirah inside. Therefore he teaches that the Halachah follows R. Akiva;</p></div>
<div class="indent2"><span class="nm">2.</span><p>Had he taught only that the Halachah follows R. Akiva, one might have thought that it must be square. Therefore he teaches that the Halachah follows R. Yosi.</p></div>
<div class="subject"><span class="nm">4)</span><p>A PARTIALLY CULTIVATED KARFEF</p></div>
<div class="indent1"><span class="nm">(a)</span><p><span class="cl">(Beraisa):</span> If a Karfef more than Beis Sa'atayim was Hukaf l'Dirah:</p></div>
<div class="indent2"><span class="nm">1.</span><p>If the majority was seeded [it is not proper for Dirah], it is like a garden, so one may not carry in it on Shabbos;</p></div>
<div class="indent2"><span class="nm">2.</span><p>If the majority was planted [with trees], it is like a Chatzer, so one may carry in it.</p></div>
<div class="indent1"><span class="nm">(b)</span><p><span class="cl">(Rav Huna brei d'Rav Yehoshua):</span> This (the Reisha) is only if it (the seeded area) is more than Beis Sa'atayim. If it is [at most] Beis Sa'atayim, one may carry in it.</p></div>
<div class="indent1"><span class="nm">(c)</span><p><span class="cl">Suggestion:</span> (Even though the seeded part is like a Karfef and the unseeded part is like a Chatzer, and there is no wall in between, they are permitted.) This is like R. Shimon:</p></div>
<div class="indent2"><span class="nm">1.</span><p><span class="cl">(Mishnah - R. Shimon):</span> Roofs, Chatzeros and Karfifos are considered like one Reshus for Kelim that were Shoves (began Shabbos) in them, but not for Kelim that were Shoves in the house.</p></div>
<div class="indent1"><span class="nm">(d)</span><p><span class="cl">Rejection:</span> Even R. Shimon would forbid. Since the unseeded part is the minority, it is Batel to the seeded part. It is as if the entire Karfef was seeded. Since it is more than Beis Sa'atayim, it is forbidden!</p></div>
