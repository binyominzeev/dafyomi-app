<p class="dedicationbox">12TH CYCLE DEDICATIONS:<BR>&nbsp;<BR>PESACHIM 6-10 - Two weeks of study material have been dedicated by Mrs. Estanne Abraham Fawer to honor the sixth Yahrzeit of her father, Reb Mordechai ben Eliezer Zvi (Rebbi Morton Weiner) Z'L, who passed away 18 Teves 5760. May the merit of supporting and advancing Dafyomi study, which was so important to him, during the weeks of his Yahrzeit serve as an Iluy for his Neshamah. </p>

<div class="subject"><span class="nm">1)</span><p>WHY WE USE A NER TO CHECK</p></div>
<div class="indent1"><span class="nm">(a)</span><p><span class="cl">(Beraisa):</span> We do not check by light of the sun or moon or a torch, only by light of a Ner, for it is good for checking; there is a hint, not a proof - It says "Lo Yimatzei," and "Va'Ychapes...va'Yimatze," and "Va'Achapes...ba'Neros," and "Ner Hash-m... Chofes..."</p></div>
<div class="indent1"><span class="nm">(b)</span><p><span class="cl">Question:</span> In what case does the Beraisa forbid checking by sunlight?</p></div>
<div class="indent1"><span class="nm">(c)</span><p><span class="cl">Answer #1:</span> It forbids checking a Chatzer (courtyard).</p></div>
<div class="indent1"><span class="nm">(d)</span><p><span class="cl">Rejection:</span> Rava taught that a Chatzer need not be checked, for ravens frequent it (we may assume that if there is Chametz, they will eat it)!</p></div>
<div class="indent1"><span class="nm">(e)</span><p><span class="cl">Answer #2:</span> It forbids checking an Achsadra (a room open on one side).</p></div>
<div class="indent1"><span class="nm">(f)</span><p><span class="cl">Rejection:</span> Rava taught that an Achsadra may be checked by its light (i.e. sunlight)!</p></div>
<div class="indent1"><span class="nm">(g)</span><p><span class="cl">Answer #3:</span> It forbids checking a room by sunlight that enters through a skylight.</p></div>
<div class="indent1"><span class="nm">(h)</span><p><span class="cl">Question:</span> Which part does it forbid?</p></div>
<div class="indent2"><span class="nm">1.</span><p>Surely, the part under the skylight is permitted - this is just like an Achsadra!</p></div>
<div class="indent1"><span class="nm">(i)</span><p><span class="cl">Answer:</span> It forbids checking the sides.</p></div>
<div class="indent1"><span class="nm">(j)</span><p><span class="cl">Question:</span> A torch should be permitted (it illuminates more than a Ner)!</p></div>
<div class="indent2"><span class="nm">1.</span><p><span class="cl">(Rava) Question:</span> What does it mean "V'Nogah ka'Or Tihyeh Karnayim mi'Yado Lo v'Sham Chevyon Uzo"?</p></div>
<div class="indent2"><span class="nm">2.</span><p><span class="cl">Answer:</span> [Even though in the future, the radiance of Tzadikim will be like the light of creation,] their radiance compared to the Shechinah will be like a Ner compared to a torch.</p></div>
<div class="indent2"><span class="nm">3.</span><p>Also, Rava taught that ideally, one should bless on fire of a torch [in Havdalah on Motza'ei Shabbos]!</p></div>
<div class="indent1"><span class="nm">(k)</span><p><span class="cl">Answer #1 (Rav Nachman bar Yitzchak):</span> A Ner is better [for Bedikah] for one can enter it into holes and cracks, unlike a torch.</p></div>
<div class="indent1"><span class="nm">(l)</span><p><span class="cl">Answer #2 (Rav Zevid):</span> A Ner illuminates in front, but a torch illuminates in back (one cannot look in its direction).</p></div>
<div class="indent1"><span class="nm">(m)</span><p><span class="cl">Answer #3 (Rav Papa):</span> One who checks with a torch is afraid [lest the house catch fire, this distracts him from checking properly]; one who checks with a Ner is not afraid.</p></div>
<div class="indent1"><span class="nm">(n)</span><p><span class="cl">Answer #4 (Ravina):</span> A Ner burns steadily, but a torch flame jumps around.</p></div>
<div class="subject"><span class="nm">2)</span><p>WHICH PLACES MUST BE CHECKED?</p></div>
<div class="indent1"><span class="nm">(a)</span><p><span class="cl">(Mishnah):</span> Any place where Chametz is not brought need not be checked.</p></div>
<div class="indent1"><span class="nm">(b)</span><p><span class="cl">Question:</span> What does 'any place' come to include?</p></div>
<div class="indent1"><span class="nm">(c)</span><p><span class="cl">Answer (Beraisa #1):</span> The following need not be checked - holes in a [wall of a] house that are high and low [and hence inconvenient to use], the [slanted] roof of a shed (one does not leave things on it), the top of a cupboard, a cattle pen, a chicken coop, a storehouse for straw, wine, or oil. (Rashi - even if one is unsure whether Chametz was brought in a cattle pen, it is exempt - we assume that the animals ate it.)</p></div>
<div class="indent1"><span class="nm">(d)</span><p>R. Shimon ben Gamliel says, if a bed divides a house (one cannot walk around it) and it is [on legs,] above the ground, [underneath] it must be checked.</p></div>
<div class="indent1"><span class="nm">(e)</span><p><span class="cl">Contradiction (Beraisa #2):</span> If a hole is [in a wall] between two people, each checks as far as his hand reaches; they Mevatel what neither of them can reach.</p></div>
<div class="indent2"><span class="nm">1.</span><p>R. Shimon ben Gamliel says, if a bed divides a house and wood and rocks are arranged underneath it, and it is raised above them, [underneath] it need not be checked.</p></div>
<div class="indent1"><span class="nm">(f)</span><p>The Beraisos contradict each other regarding beds and holes!</p></div>
<div class="indent1"><span class="nm">(g)</span><p><span class="cl">Resolution:</span> Beraisa #1 exempts checking holes that are so high or low that they are uncomfortable to use; Beraisa #2 discusses holes in the middle;</p></div>
<div class="indent2"><span class="nm">1.</span><p>Beraisa #1 exempts a bed that is not high off the ground, so it is inconvenient to use the space underneath; Beraisa #2 discusses a bed high off the ground. (Obviously, 'convenient' is relative to the residents - children are prone to put Chametz in places that adults would never use.)!</p></div>
<div class="indent1"><span class="nm">(h)</span><p><span class="cl">Question:</span> Storehouses of wine must be checked!</p></div>
<div class="indent2"><span class="nm">1.</span><p><span class="cl">(Beraisa #3):</span> Storehouses of wine must be checked; storehouses of oil need not be checked.</p></div>
<div class="indent1"><span class="nm">(i)</span><p><span class="cl">Answer:</span> Beraisa #3 discusses a storehouse used to supply [when one runs out of wine during the meal, the servant brings more - he could be holding bread at the time].</p></div>
<div class="indent1"><span class="nm">(j)</span><p><span class="cl">Question:</span> If so, storehouses of oil must be checked for the same reason!</p></div>
<div class="indent1"><span class="nm">(k)</span><p><span class="cl">Answer:</span> People know in advance how much oil they will eat (they prepare all the oil needed before the meal), but they do not know how much wine they will drink.</p></div>
<div class="indent1"><span class="nm">(l)</span><p><span class="cl">(R. Chiya - Beraisa):</span> Chachamim made storehouses of beer in Bavel like storehouses of wine in Eretz Yisrael, when people are supplied from them [during a meal].</p></div>
<div class="indent1"><span class="nm">(m)</span><p><span class="cl">(Rav Chisda):</span> A storehouse of fish need not be checked.</p></div>
<div class="indent1"><span class="nm">(n)</span><p><span class="cl">Question (Beraisa):</span> It must be checked.</p></div>
<div class="indent1"><span class="nm">(o)</span><p><span class="cl">Answer:</span> A storehouse of big fish need not be checked (people know how many they will eat), a storehouse of small fish must be checked.</p></div>
<div class="indent1"><span class="nm">(p)</span><p><span class="cl">(Rabah bar Rav Huna):</span> The places where salt and wax [for Neros] are kept must be checked.</p></div>
<div class="indent1"><span class="nm">(q)</span><p><span class="cl">(Rav Papa):</span> The places where wood and dates are kept must be checked.</p></div>
<div class="subject"><span class="nm">3)</span><p>CHECKING HOLES AND CRACKS</p></div>
<div class="indent1"><span class="nm">(a)</span><p><span class="cl">(Beraisa):</span> One need not stick his hand into holes and cracks, because it is dangerous.</p></div>
<div class="indent1"><span class="nm">(b)</span><p><span class="cl">Question:</span> What is the danger?</p></div>
<div class="indent2"><span class="nm">1.</span><p><span class="cl">Suggestion:</span> It is dangerous on account of scorpions.</p></div>
<div class="indent2"><span class="nm">2.</span><p><span class="cl">Rejection:</span> If so, one would not use it (we would not be concerned for Chametz there)!</p></div>
<div class="indent1"><span class="nm">(c)</span><p><span class="cl">Answer:</span> The case is, [Chametz was used in a building, and] it fell (scorpions are often found amidst the rubble - therefore, it suffices to look for Chametz in open view).</p></div>
<div class="indent1"><span class="nm">(d)</span><p><span class="cl">Question:</span> If so, it need not be checked [at all]!</p></div>
<div class="indent2"><span class="nm">1.</span><p><span class="cl">(Mishnah):</span> If a house collapsed on top of Chametz, it is as if Bi'ur was done.</p></div>
<div class="indent1"><span class="nm">(e)</span><p><span class="cl">Answer:</span> That is when a dog could not find the Chametz (it is buried by more than three Tefachim of rubble) - in a case where it can find the Chametz, Bedikah is required. (Tosfos - the Mishnah discusses when there was definitely Chametz there, therefore when it can be found he must toil to check in a safe way, e.g. to dig with shovels.)</p></div>
<div class="indent1"><span class="nm">(f)</span><p><span class="cl">Question:</span> [Why does danger exempt?] R. Elazar taught that harm will not befall a Shali'ach (someone on the way to do a) Mitzvah!</p></div>
<div class="indent1"><span class="nm">(g)</span><p><span class="cl">Answer #1 (Rav Ashi):</span> We are concerned lest he lost a needle, and will [also] look for it at the time of Bedikah [so he is not considered a Shali'ach Mitzvah].</p></div>
<div class="indent1"><span class="nm">(h)</span><p><span class="cl">Rejection (Beraisa):</span> If one says, 'I give this coin to Tzedakah in order that my son should live', or 'in order that I will merit the world to come', he is a perfect Tzadik [in this respect, i.e. one may intend to do a Mitzvah and also benefit - the same applies to Bedikah and looking for a needle]!</p></div>
<div class="bbbline">8b----------------------------------------8b</p></div>
<div class="indent1"><span class="nm">(i)</span><p><span class="cl">Answer #2:</span> We are concerned lest he look for a lost needle <i>after</i> the Bedikah.</p></div>
<div class="indent1"><span class="nm">(j)</span><p><span class="cl">Answer #3 (Rav Nachman bar Yitzchak):</span> The danger is on account of Nochrim - it is like Flimo:</p></div>
<div class="indent2"><span class="nm">1.</span><p><span class="cl">(Beraisa):</span> If a hole is between Reuven and a Nochri, Reuven checks as far as his hand reaches; he is Mevatel what he cannot reach;</p></div>
<div class="indent2"><span class="nm">2.</span><p>Flimo says, he does not check a hole at all, on account of danger.</p></div>
<div class="indent1"><span class="nm">(k)</span><p><span class="cl">Question:</span> What is the danger?</p></div>
<div class="indent1"><span class="nm">(l)</span><p><span class="cl">Answer:</span> It is dangerous because [the Nochri will accuse him] of witchcraft.</p></div>
<div class="indent1"><span class="nm">(m)</span><p><span class="cl">Question:</span> If so, Reuven would not use it!</p></div>
<div class="indent1"><span class="nm">(n)</span><p><span class="cl">Answer:</span> Reuven uses it during the day, by sunlight without a Ner - the Nochri cannot accuse him of witchcraft;</p></div>
<div class="indent2"><span class="nm">1.</span><p>Bedikah is at night, by light of a Ner - the Nochri would accuse him of witchcraft.</p></div>
<div class="indent1"><span class="nm">(o)</span><p><span class="cl">Question:</span> But R. Elazar taught that harm will not befall a Shali'ach Mitzvah!</p></div>
<div class="indent1"><span class="nm">(p)</span><p><span class="cl">Answer:</span> This does not apply when danger is common - "Va'Yomer Shmuel Eich Elech v'Shoma Sha'ul va'Horagani;" (he was concerned for danger, even though Hash-m told him to anoint David, a Mitzvah; Hash-m suggested a ruse to avoid the danger -) "Va'Yomer Hash-m Eglas Bakar Tikach b'Yadecha [v'Omarta Lizbo'ach la'Shem Bosi]!"</p></div>
<div class="subject"><span class="nm">4)</span><p>A SHALI'ACH MITZVAH IS NOT HARMED</p></div>
<div class="indent1"><span class="nm">(a)</span><p><span class="cl">Question:</span> If Talmidim live in [villages in] a valley, may they go early [before dawn to the Beis Medrash] and return late [after dark - or are we concerned for damaging spirits]?</p></div>
<div class="indent1"><span class="nm">(b)</span><p><span class="cl">Answer (Rav):</span> They may go - [I am so sure that the Mitzvah will protect them, that] I accept any harm [fitting to befall them] on myself!</p></div>
<div class="indent1"><span class="nm">(c)</span><p><span class="cl">Question:</span> May they return [to their lodging after dark]?</p></div>
<div class="indent1"><span class="nm">(d)</span><p>Rav was unsure.</p></div>
<div class="indent1"><span class="nm">(e)</span><p><span class="cl">(R. Elazar):</span> Harm will not befall a Shali'ach Mitzvah on the way there or on the way back.</p></div>
<div class="indent1"><span class="nm">(f)</span><p><span class="cl">Question:</span> Like which Tana is this?</p></div>
<div class="indent1"><span class="nm">(g)</span><p><span class="cl">Answer:</span> It is like Isi ben Yehudah:</p></div>
<div class="indent2"><span class="nm">1.</span><p><span class="cl">(Beraisa - Isi ben Yehudah):</span> "V'Lo Yachmod Ish Es Artzecha" - this teaches that one [who goes to Yerushalayim for the festival] may leave his cow grazing in the dirt and his chicken pecking in the wasteheap, and they will not be attacked by Chayos and weasels;</p></div>
<div class="indent2"><span class="nm">2.</span><p>It is normal for animals to be damaged, yet the Torah promises that they will not be [on account of the Mitzvah] - all the more so people, who are not normally damaged [because they have Mazel, i.e. supernatural protection], will not be harmed!</p></div>
<div class="indent2"><span class="nm">3.</span><p><span class="cl">Question:</span> This teaches that they will not be harmed on the way - what is the source regarding the way back?</p></div>
<div class="indent2"><span class="nm">4.</span><p><span class="cl">Answer:</span> "U'Fonisa va'Boker v'Holachta l'Ohalecha" - you will return and find your tent b'Shalom (intact).</p></div>
<div class="indent2"><span class="nm">5.</span><p><span class="cl">Question:</span> Since it teaches that they will return b'Shalom, why must it teach that they will not be harmed on the way?</p></div>
<div class="indent2"><span class="nm">6.</span><p><span class="cl">Answer:</span> The verse ("V'Lo Yachmod Ish Es Artzecha") teaches R. Ami's law, that Aliyah l'Regel (coming to Yerushalayim on the festivals) is obligatory only for someone who owns land [in Eretz Yisrael].</p></div>
<div class="indent1"><span class="nm">(h)</span><p><span class="cl">(R. Avin bar Rav Ada):</span> There are not Ginosar fruits (they are unbelievably tasty - see Berachos 44A) in Yerushalayim lest people say 'it was enough to come to Yerushalayim to eat the fruits', and then the Aliyah l'Regel would be Lo Lishmah (not for the sake of the Mitzvah).</p></div>
<div class="indent1"><span class="nm">(i)</span><p>Similarly, R. Dostai taught that there are not Chamei Tiverya in Yerushalayim lest people say 'it was enough to come to Yerushalayim for the hot springs', and then the Aliyah l'Regel would be Lo Lishmah.</p></div>
<div class="subject"><span class="nm">5)</span><p>CHECKING TWO ROWS IN A WINE CELLAR</p></div>
<div class="indent1"><span class="nm">(a)</span><p><span class="cl">(Mishnah) Question:</span> In what case was it taught that two rows [in a wine cellar must be checked]?</p></div>
<div class="indent1"><span class="nm">(b)</span><p><span class="cl">Question:</span> We were not discussing a wine cellar!</p></div>
<div class="indent1"><span class="nm">(c)</span><p><span class="cl">Answer:</span> It teaches that <i>any</i> place where Chametz is not brought need not be checked - this includes storehouses of wine or oil;</p></div>
<div class="indent2"><span class="nm">1.</span><p><span class="cl">Question:</span> If so, why was it taught that two rows in a wine cellar must be checked?</p></div>
<div class="indent2"><span class="nm">2.</span><p><span class="cl">Answer:</span> That is in a place where Chametz is brought, i.e. people are supplied from them [during a meal].</p></div>
<div class="indent1"><span class="nm">(d)</span><p><span class="cl">(Mishnah - Beis Shamai):</span> Two rows [along the entire face of the wine cellar].</p></div>
<div class="indent1"><span class="nm">(e)</span><p><span class="cl">(Rav Yehudah):</span> (Barrels are arranged in rows and columns, and are piled up on top of each other; the first Shurah (array of rows) consists of the barrels facing the opening of the cellar, in every column [from left to right] and at every height.) Beis Shamai require the first two Shuros, from the floor to the ceiling;</p></div>
<div class="indent1"><span class="nm">(f)</span><p><span class="cl">(R. Yochanan):</span> They require [two Shuros that are like] one bent Shurah (the first Shurah and the 'Shurah' (array) of all the barrels on top.</p></div>
<div class="indent1"><span class="nm">(g)</span><p><span class="cl">Support (for Rav Yehudah - Beraisa #1 - Beis Shamai):</span> Two Shuros along the entire face of the wine cellar must be checked - these are from the floor to the ceiling.</p></div>
<div class="indent1"><span class="nm">(h)</span><p><span class="cl">Support (for R. Yochanan - Beraisa #2 - Beis Shamai):</span> Two Shuros along the entire face of the wine cellar must be checked - the outer Shurah facing the opening and the top Shurah facing the ceiling;</p></div>

<div class="indent1"><span class="nm">(i)</span><p><span class="cl">(Mishnah - Beis Hillel):</span> The two outermost rows that are the top ones [must be checked].</p></div>
<div class="indent1"><span class="nm">(j)</span><p><span class="cl">(Rav):</span> This means the top [single] row [facing the opening] and the row below it.</p></div>
<div class="indent1"><span class="nm">(k)</span><p><span class="cl">(Shmuel):</span> This means the top row [facing the opening] and the row in back of it.</p></div>
<div class="indent1"><span class="nm">(l)</span><p><span class="cl">Question:</span> What is Rav's reason?</p></div>
<div class="indent1"><span class="nm">(m)</span><p><span class="cl">Answer:</span> It says 'outermost' [implying that both face the opening].</p></div>
<div class="indent2"><span class="nm">1.</span><p><span class="cl">Question:</span> But they are called 'top' [implying that both face the ceiling]!</p></div>
<div class="indent2"><span class="nm">2.</span><p><span class="cl">Answer:</span> They are called top to exclude those under the row below the top.</p></div>
