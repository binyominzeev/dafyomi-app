<div class="subject"><span class="nm">1)</span><p>WHO HAS TORAH?</p></div>
<div class="indent1"><span class="nm">(a)</span><p>We also learn from Rav Avdimi bar Chama [that one must make Simanim for Torah].</p></div>
<div class="indent1"><span class="nm">(b)</span><p><span class="cl">Question:</span> What do we learn from "Lo va'Shamayim Hi...; V'Lo me'Ever la'Yam Hi"?</p></div>
<div class="indent1"><span class="nm">(c)</span><p><span class="cl">Answer #1 (Rav Avdimi bar Chama):</span> If Torah would be in Shamayim or across the sea, we would be obligated to go there to pursue it. (The verse continues "... Leimor Mi Ya'aleh Lanu ha'Shamaimah va'Yikacheha Lanu." This teaches that we spare no efforts to learn Torah.)</p></div>
<div class="indent1"><span class="nm">(d)</span><p><span class="cl">Answer #2 (Rava):</span> Torah is not found in one who is haughty about it like Shamayim (he thinks that he does not need to learn from a Rebbi), nor one who is confident about it [that he will remember without reviewing - Maharsha] like the sea.</p></div>
<div class="indent1"><span class="nm">(e)</span><p><span class="cl">Answer #3 (R. Yochanan):</span> Torah is not found in haughty people, nor in wholesalers [who cross the sea] or merchants.</p></div>
<div class="subject"><span class="nm">2)</span><p>HOW WE ARE ME'ABAR CITIES</p></div>
<div class="indent1"><span class="nm">(a)</span><p><span class="cl">(Beraisa) Question:</span> How are we Me'abar a city?</p></div>
<div class="indent1"><span class="nm">(b)</span><p><span class="cl">Answer:</span> If it is long, we leave it like it is. If it is circular, we give it corners [to make it square]. If it is square, we do not give it corners. (This will be explained. 'Squaring' means making rectangular, but not necessarily square.)</p></div>
<div class="indent2"><span class="nm">1.</span><p>If one side is wider than the other, we consider it as if they were even.</p></div>
<div class="indent2"><span class="nm">2.</span><p>If one or two houses jut out, we consider a line to be drawn between them, and we measure 2000 Amos from it;</p></div>
<div class="indent2"><span class="nm">3.</span><p>If the city is shaped like an [archer's] bow or [the Greek letter] Gamma (an 'L' shape), we consider it as if it (the hollow part) was full of houses and Chatzeros, and we measure 2000 Amos from them.</p></div>
<div class="indent1"><span class="nm">(c)</span><p><span class="cl">Question:</span> The Beraisa says that if it is long, we leave it like it is. This is obvious!</p></div>
<div class="indent1"><span class="nm">(d)</span><p><span class="cl">Answer:</span> The case is, it is long and thin. One might have thought that we make it square. The Beraisa teaches that we do not.</p></div>
<div class="indent1"><span class="nm">(e)</span><p><span class="cl">Question:</span> The Beraisa says that if it is square, we do not give it corners. This is obvious!</p></div>
<div class="indent1"><span class="nm">(f)</span><p><span class="cl">Answer:</span> The case is, it is square, but the sides are not aligned like [the four directions of] the world (north-south and east-west, rather, they are at an angle, e.g. northwest-southeast and northeast-southwest);</p></div>
<div class="indent2"><span class="nm">1.</span><p>One might have thought that we add corners to align it. The Beraisa teaches that we do not. (See Perush Chai diagram, Perek 5 number 12, in the <a href=../chai/eruv-5chai012.jpg>English Charts</a> section.)</p></div>
<div class="indent1"><span class="nm">(g)</span><p><span class="cl">(Beraisa):</span> If one or two houses jut out...</p></div>
<div class="indent1"><span class="nm">(h)</span><p><span class="cl">Question:</span> If we extend the Techum due to one house, there is no need to say that we do so due to two!</p></div>
<div class="indent1"><span class="nm">(i)</span><p><span class="cl">Answer:</span> The case is, they stick out in different directions;</p></div>
<div class="indent2"><span class="nm">1.</span><p>One might have thought that we extend in one direction for one house, but not in two directions. The Beraisa teaches that this is not so.</p></div>
<div class="indent1"><span class="nm">(j)</span><p><span class="cl">(Beraisa):</span> If the city is shaped like a bow or Gamma, we consider it as if it was full of houses and Chatzeros, and we measure 2000 Amos from them. (Rashba - we complete the Gamma to be a full square, and not just what is inside the diagonal.)</p></div>
<div class="indent1"><span class="nm">(k)</span><p><span class="cl">(Rav Huna):</span> If a city is shaped like a bow:</p></div>
<div class="indent2"><span class="nm">1.</span><p>If the ends are separated by 4000 Amos, we measure from the bow. (See Perush Chai diagram, Perek 5 number 30, in the <a href=../chai/eruv-5chai030.jpg>English Charts</a> section. Rashi - each house measures from its door. Rosh - we measure from the place where the sides of the city are 4000 Amos apart);</p></div>
<div class="indent2"><span class="nm">2.</span><p>If they are less than 4000 Amos apart (the Techumim of the ends overlap, we consider it to be full of houses), we measure from the Yeser (the line between the ends of the bow).</p></div>
<div class="indent1"><span class="nm">(l)</span><p><span class="cl">Question:</span> Elsewhere, Rav Huna does not allow so far between ends!</p></div>
<div class="indent2"><span class="nm">1.</span><p><span class="cl">(Rav Huna):</span> The wall of the city may be breached 141 and a third Amos (twice the Shi'ur of a Karfef, i.e. 70 Amos and a fraction, and it is still considered one city. If it is more than this, it is considered two cities.)</p></div>
<div class="indent1"><span class="nm">(m)</span><p><span class="cl">Answer (Rabah bar Ula):</span> If it is breached from one side, up to 4000 Amos are allowed. If it is breached from two sides, up to 141 [and a third] are allowed.</p></div>
<div class="indent1"><span class="nm">(n)</span><p><span class="cl">Question:</span> Does Rav Huna teach that we allow a Karfef for each city? He already taught this elsewhere!</p></div>
<div class="bbbline">55b----------------------------------------55b</p></div>
<div class="indent2"><span class="nm">1.</span><p><span class="cl">(Mishnah - R. Meir):</span> We give [70 Amos and a fraction for] a Karfef to a city;</p></div>
<div class="indent2"><span class="nm">2.</span><p>Chachamim say, we give a Karfef only between two cities.</p></div>
<div class="indent2"><span class="nm">3.</span><p><span class="cl">(Rav Huna):</span> Two Karfifos are given for two cities;</p></div>
<div class="indent2"><span class="nm">4.</span><p><span class="cl">(Chiya bar Rav):</span> We give only one Karfef.</p></div>
<div class="indent1"><span class="nm">(o)</span><p>Rav Huna needs to teach both of these;</p></div>
<div class="indent2"><span class="nm">1.</span><p>Had he taught only here, one might have thought that we give two Karfifos because they were originally one city, but otherwise we give only one;</p></div>
<div class="indent2"><span class="nm">2.</span><p>Had he taught only there, one might have thought that we give two Karfifos because they are truly two cities and they require more space, but when the wall of one city is breached, one Karfef suffices.</p></div>
<div class="indent1"><span class="nm">(p)</span><p><span class="cl">Question:</span> (When the ends are less than 4000 apart and we measure from the Yeser.) What is the maximum distance between the [middle of the] bow and the [middle of the] Yeser?</p></div>
<div class="indent1"><span class="nm">(q)</span><p><span class="cl">Answer #1 (Rabah bar Rav Huna):</span> We allow 2000 Amos.</p></div>
<div class="indent1"><span class="nm">(r)</span><p><span class="cl">Answer #2 (his son Rava):</span> We allow more than 2000 Amos. (Tosfos - Rava holds that we measure from the Yeser if the ends are less than 4000 Amos apart <i>or</i> if the Yeser is within 2000 of the bow.)</p></div>
<div class="indent1"><span class="nm">(s)</span><p><span class="cl">(Abaye):</span> Presumably, Rava is right, for one may go [anywhere within the bow] via houses. (He is always within 2000 Amos of houses on the sides of the bow.)</p></div>
<div class="subject"><span class="nm">3)</span><p>THINGS INCLUDED IN THE IBUR</p></div>
<div class="indent1"><span class="nm">(a)</span><p><span class="cl">(Mishnah):</span> Gedudiyos 10 tall [extend the city].</p></div>
<div class="indent1"><span class="nm">(b)</span><p><span class="cl">Question:</span> What is a Gedudiyah?</p></div>
<div class="indent1"><span class="nm">(c)</span><p><span class="cl">Answer (Rav Yehudah):</span> It is three walls without a roof.</p></div>
<div class="indent1"><span class="nm">(d)</span><p><span class="cl">Question:</span> What is the law if there are two walls with a roof?</p></div>
<div class="indent1"><span class="nm">(e)</span><p><span class="cl">Answer (Beraisa):</span> The following become part of the Ibur <i>only</i> if they have a place of Dirah:</p></div>
<div class="indent2"><span class="nm">1.</span><p>(Aruch - a Nefesh (monument over a grave) that is four by four Amos,) a bridge, and a cemetery;</p></div>
<div class="indent2"><span class="nm">2.</span><p>A Beis ha'Keneses with a place of Dirah for the overseer, and a house of idolatry with a place of Dirah for the priest;</p></div>
<div class="indent2"><span class="nm">3.</span><p>Stables and storehouses in the field;</p></div>
<div class="indent2"><span class="nm">4.</span><p>The following [are places of Dirah, so they always] become part of the Ibur - (Rashi - a Nefesh (a watchman's quarters over a grave,) shacks in the field and houses [on islands] in the sea.</p></div>
<div class="indent2"><span class="nm">5.</span><p>The following do not become part of the Ibur - a Nefesh that was breached on two sides;</p></div>
<div class="indent2"><span class="nm">6.</span><p>A pit, cave, and fence;</p></div>
<div class="indent2"><span class="nm">7.</span><p>A dovecote in the field and a house on a boat.</p></div>
<div class="indent2"><span class="nm">8.</span><p><span class="cl">Suggestion:</span> It says that a Nefesh breached on two sides is not included. This is [even] if it has a roof!</p></div>
<div class="indent1"><span class="nm">(f)</span><p><span class="cl">Rejection:</span> No, it has no roof.</p></div>
<div class="indent1"><span class="nm">(g)</span><p><span class="cl">Question:</span> What use is a house in the sea?</p></div>
<div class="indent1"><span class="nm">(h)</span><p><span class="cl">Answer (Rav Papa):</span> It is used to store Kelim from boats.</p></div>
<div class="indent1"><span class="nm">(i)</span><p><span class="cl">Question:</span> A cave becomes part of the Ibur!</p></div>
<div class="indent2"><span class="nm">1.</span><p><span class="cl">(R. Chiya - Beraisa):</span> A cave becomes part of the Ibur.</p></div>
<div class="indent1"><span class="nm">(j)</span><p><span class="cl">Answer (Abaye):</span> The Beraisa discusses a cave with a building at its opening.</p></div>
<div class="indent1"><span class="nm">(k)</span><p><span class="cl">Question:</span> If so, it is part of the Ibur due to the building! (It is misleading to say that the cave becomes part of the Ibur.)</p></div>
<div class="indent1"><span class="nm">(l)</span><p><span class="cl">Answer:</span> If the building is too small (less than four by four), the cave completes the Shi'ur.</p></div>
<div class="indent1"><span class="nm">(m)</span><p><span class="cl">(Rav Huna):</span> If one dwells in a [temporary] hut, his Techum is 2000 Amos from the opening of his hut. (Even if there are other huts nearby, we do not consider the extent of the huts like a city, and say that it counts like only four Amos.)</p></div>
<div class="indent1"><span class="nm">(n)</span><p><span class="cl">Question (Rav Chisda):</span> [It says about Machaneh Yisrael] "va'Yachanu Al ha'Yarden mi'Beis ha'Yshimos (Ad Avel ha'Shitim)." Rabah bar bar Chanah saw this place. It was three by three Parsa'os;</p></div>
<div class="indent2"><span class="nm">1.</span><p><span class="cl">(Beraisa):</span> One may not eliminate in front of or to the side of Machaneh Yisrael [lest the cloud and Aron will go in that direction], only in back. (Therefore, people who camped in the front had to walk three Parsa'os. If we measure from each person's tent, this is 12 times the Techum of 2000 Amos! The question is not so clear, because all agree that the Techum of 2000 Amos is only mid'Rabanan. <a href=ev-ps-appendix.htm#20>See note 20 in Appendix</a>.)</p></div>
<div class="indent1"><span class="nm">(o)</span><p><span class="cl">Answer (Rava):</span> You cannot learn from the encampment in the Midbar. Since it says "Al Pi Hash-m Yachanu v'Al Pi Hash-m Yisa'u", their dwellings were considered Kavu'a (fixed).</p></div>
<div class="indent1"><span class="nm">(p)</span><p><span class="cl">(R. Chinena bar Rav Kahana):</span> If there are three Chatzeros, and each has at least two houses, this is Kavu'a.</p></div>
<div class="subject"><span class="nm">4)</span><p>THINGS NECESSARY FOR PROPER LIVING</p></div>
<div class="indent1"><span class="nm">(a)</span><p><span class="cl">(Rav Yehudah):</span> People who dwell in huts (they graze flocks, and relocate when the pasture is consumed) or traverse wildernesses lack [a decent] life. Their [wives'] children are not [necessarily] their own.</p></div>
<div class="indent1"><span class="nm">(b)</span><p><span class="cl">Support (Beraisa - Eliezer Ish Biriya):</span> Hut dwellers are like dead people. Regarding their daughters it says "Arur Shochev Im Kol Behemah." (Maharsha - we merely show that their life is indecent. Rashi - the verse alludes to adultery.)</p></div>
<div class="indent1"><span class="nm">(c)</span><p><span class="cl">Question:</span> What is the reason?</p></div>
<div class="indent1"><span class="nm">(d)</span><p><span class="cl">Answer #1 (Ula):</span> They do not have baths. (Rashi - when the men go far away to bathe, others come to be with their wives.)</p></div>
<div class="indent1"><span class="nm">(e)</span><p><span class="cl">Answer #2 (R. Yochanan):</span> Women tell each other when it is time to immerse after being Nidah. (Rashi - they accompany each other when going [far away] to immerse. Resha'im hear them, and are isolated with them.)</p></div>
<div class="indent1"><span class="nm">(f)</span><p><span class="cl">Question:</span> What is the difference between these answers?</p></div>
<div class="indent1"><span class="nm">(g)</span><p><span class="cl">Answer:</span> They argue in a case when there is a river nearby. (It allows covert immersion, but it is not proper for bathing.)</p></div>
<div class="indent1"><span class="nm">(h)</span><p><span class="cl">(Rav Huna):</span> A Chacham may not live in a city without vegetables (Rashi - they are inexpensive and good to eat, and thereby enable people to engage in Torah. Sanhedrin 17b - R. Akiva requires a Chacham to live in a city with Pira (produce), for it enlightens the eyes.)</p></div>
<div class="indent1"><span class="nm">(i)</span><p><span class="cl">Question:</span> A Beraisa teaches that vegetables are bad!</p></div>
<div class="indent2"><span class="nm">1.</span><p>Three things increase excrement, bend a person's stature and remove one part in 500 of his eyesight - coarse bread, new beer and vegetables.</p></div>
