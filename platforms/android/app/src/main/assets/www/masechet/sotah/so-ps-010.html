<p class="bas subject"><span class="nm">1)</span>SHIMSHON (cont.)</p>
<p class="bas indent1"><span class="nm">(a)</span><span class="cl">Question:</span> "And the child grew, and Hash-m blessed him" - in what was he blessed?</p>
<p class="bas indent1"><span class="nm">(b)</span><span class="cl">Answer (Rav Yehudah):</span> His Ever was as big as a man's, and his semen was like a gushing river.</p>
<p class="bas indent1"><span class="nm">(c)</span><span class="cl">(Rav):</span> "Hash-m, remember me... I will take vengeance for one of my two eyes, on the Pelishtim (who gouged them out)" - remember the 20 years I judged Yisrael, and I never told one of them to transport my staff for me. (Maharsha - I did not deserve blindness, for I did not take even a light bribe.)</p>
<p class="bas indent1"><span class="nm">(d)</span><span class="cl">Question:</span> "Shimshon captured 300 foxes" (and used them to burn the fields of the Pelishtim). Why did he use specifically foxes?</p>
<p class="bas indent1"><span class="nm">(e)</span><span class="cl">Answer (R. Eivo bar Nagdi):</span> A fox flees backwards. It is fitting to punish the Pelishtim, who went back on their oath (not to afflict Yisrael).</p>
<p class="bas indent1"><span class="nm">(f)</span><span class="cl">(Beraisa - R. Shimon ha'Chasid):</span> Shimshon's shoulders spanned 60 Amos, for he carried the doors of the Azah gate on his shoulders.</p>
<p class="bas indent2"><span class="nm">1.</span>We have a tradition that the doors were 60 Amos wide.</p>
<p class="bas indent1"><span class="nm">(g)</span><span class="cl">(R. Yochanan):</span> "He would be Tochen (grind) in the jail" - this refers to Bi'ah;</p>
<p class="bas indent2"><span class="nm">1.</span>Everyone brought his wife to become pregnant from Shimshon (hoping that the child would be strong).</p>
<p class="bas indent2"><span class="nm">2.</span><span class="cl">(Rav Papa):</span> This is like people say, put wine before a wine-drinker, and put vegetables before a gardener. (Shimshon was frequent with women.)</p>
<p class="bas indent1"><span class="nm">(h)</span><span class="cl">(R. Yochanan):</span> If a man has Bi'as Znus, his wife has Bi'as Znus under him.</p>
<p class="bas indent2"><span class="nm">1.</span>"If my heart was enticed by a woman, if I waited by the door of my fellow man", then "others will pursue (Bi'ah with) my wife."</p>
<p class="bas indent2"><span class="nm">2.</span>This is like people say, he is in the big gourds, and she is in the small gourds.</p>
<p class="bas indent1"><span class="nm">(i)</span><span class="cl">(R. Yochanan):</span> Shimshon judged Yisrael like Hash-m - "Dan will judge his people like One (the lone Judge)."</p>
<p class="bas indent1"><span class="nm">(j)</span><span class="cl">(R. Yochanan):</span> Shimshon was given a name of Hash-m - "Hash-m is a Shemesh (sun) and shield."</p>
<p class="bas indent1"><span class="nm">(k)</span><span class="cl">Question:</span> If so, it should be forbidden to erase the word 'Shemesh'!</p>
<p class="bas indent1"><span class="nm">(l)</span><span class="cl">Correction:</span> Rather, Shimshon resembles a name of Hash-m;</p>
<p class="bas indent2"><span class="nm">1.</span>Just like Hash-m shields over the whole world, Shimshon shielded over Yisrael in his generation.</p>
<p class="bas indent1"><span class="nm">(m)</span><span class="cl">(R. Yochanan):</span> Bilam was lame in one foot - "he went Shefi (in a lowly way.)" Shimshon was lame in both feet - it says (in Yakov's Berachah to Dan, which alludes to Shimshon) "Shefifon."</p>
<p class="bas subject"><span class="nm">2)</span>SPECIAL GIFTS</p>
<p class="bas indent1"><span class="nm">(a)</span><span class="cl">(Beraisa):</span> Five people were created with a semblance of Shamayim. All five were stricken through this - Shimshon in his strength, Sha'ul in his neck, Avshalom in his hair, Tzidkiyahu in his eyes, and Asa in his legs.</p>
<p class="bas indent2"><span class="nm">1.</span>Shimshon was stricken in his strength - "his strength left him."</p>
<p class="bas indent2"><span class="nm">2.</span>Sha'ul was stricken in his neck - "Sha'ul took the sword and fell on it (at his neck);</p>
<p class="bas indent2"><span class="nm">3.</span>We will explain later how Avshalom was stricken in his hair.</p>
<p class="bas indent2"><span class="nm">4.</span>Tzidkiyahu was stricken in his eyes - "he blinded Tzidkiyahu's eyes."</p>
<p class="bas indent2"><span class="nm">5.</span>Asa was stricken in his legs - "when he grew old, his legs fell sick."</p>
<p class="bas indent3"><span class="nm">i.</span><span class="cl">(Rav Yehudah):</span> He was stricken by Pedagra (a sickness that makes the toes hurt).</p>
<p class="bas indent1"><span class="nm">(b)</span><span class="cl">Question (Mar Zutra brei d'Rav Nachman):</span> What is this like?</p>
<p class="bas indent1"><span class="nm">(c)</span><span class="cl">Answer (Rav Nachman):</span> It is like a needle in living flesh.</p>
<p class="bas indent2"><span class="nm">1.</span><span class="cl">Question:</span> How did Rav Nachman know?</p>
<p class="bas indent2"><span class="nm">2.</span><span class="cl">Answer #1:</span> He himself suffered from this.</p>
<p class="bas indent2"><span class="nm">3.</span><span class="cl">Answer #2:</span> He had a tradition from his Rebbi.</p>
<p class="bas indent2"><span class="nm">4.</span><span class="cl">Answer #3:</span> "Hash-m reveals secrets to those who fear Him."</p>
<p class="bas indent1"><span class="nm">(d)</span><span class="cl">(Rava):</span> Asa was punished because he used Chachamim to make war - "Asa summonsed all of Yehudah. No one was clean (exempt)".</p>
<p class="bas indent1"><span class="nm">(e)</span><span class="cl">Question:</span> Why does it say "no one was exempt"? (It already said that he summonsed everyone!)</p>
<p class="bas indent1"><span class="nm">(f)</span><span class="cl">Answer (Rav Yehudah):</span> This includes even a bride and groom who just got married.</p>
<p class="bas subject"><span class="nm">3)</span>YEHUDAH AND TAMAR</p>
<p class="bas indent1"><span class="nm">(a)</span><span class="cl">Contradiction:</span> It says "Shimshon descended to Timnah", and it says "your (Tamar's) father-in-law (Yehudah) is ascending to Timnah"!</p>
<p class="bas indent1"><span class="nm">(b)</span><span class="cl">Answer #1 (R. Elazar):</span> Shimshon was disgraced there, so it says that he descended. Yehudah was (ultimately) elevated through what happened there, so it says that he ascended.</p>
<p class="bas indent1"><span class="nm">(c)</span><span class="cl">Answer #2 (R. Shmuel bar Nachmani):</span> There are two places called Timnah. One is on a hill, one is in a valley.</p>
<p class="bas indent1"><span class="nm">(d)</span><span class="cl">Answer #3 (Rav Papa):</span> Timnah is on a slope. Shimshon came from the top, and Yehudah came from the bottom.</p>
<p class="bas indent1"><span class="nm">(e)</span><span class="cl">Question:</span> "She (Tamar) sat b'Fesach Einayim (opening of eyes)" - what is this?</p>
<p class="bas indent1"><span class="nm">(f)</span><span class="cl">Answer #1 (R. Alexandri):</span> It is the doorway of Avraham, the place all eyes long for.</p>
<p class="bas indent1"><span class="nm">(g)</span><span class="cl">Answer #2 (R. Chanin):</span> There was a place called Einayim. She sat at the entrance.</p>
<p class="bas indent1"><span class="nm">(h)</span><span class="cl">Answer #3 (R. Shmuel bar Nachmani):</span> She gave eyes (justifications) to her words.</p>
<p class="bas indent2"><span class="nm">1.</span><span class="cl">Yehudah:</span> Maybe you are a Nochris!</p>
<p class="bas indent2"><span class="nm">2.</span><span class="cl">Tamar:</span> No, I am a convert.</p>
<p class="bas indent2"><span class="nm">3.</span><span class="cl">Yehudah:</span> Maybe you are married!</p>
<p class="bas indent2"><span class="nm">4.</span><span class="cl">Tamar:</span> No, I am single.</p>
<p class="bas indent2"><span class="nm">5.</span><span class="cl">Yehudah:</span> Maybe your father betrothed you to a man!</p>
<p class="bas indent2"><span class="nm">6.</span><span class="cl">Tamar:</span> No, I am an orphan.</p>
<p class="bas indent2"><span class="nm">7.</span><span class="cl">Yehudah:</span> Maybe you are a Nidah!</p>
<p class="bas indent2"><span class="nm">8.</span><span class="cl">Tamar:</span> No, I am Tehorah.</p>
<p class="bas indent1"><span class="nm">(i)</span><span class="cl">(Reish Lakish):</span> "(Avraham) planted an Eshel in Be'er Sheva" - he planted an orchard with delicacies.</p>
<p class="bas indent1"><span class="nm">(j)</span>R. Yehudah and R. Nechemyah argued about whether Eshel is an orchard, or if it is an inn.</p>
<p class="bas indent1"><span class="nm">(k)</span><span class="cl">Question:</span> Granted, if it means 'orchard', we understand why it says "planted";</p>
<p class="bas indent2"><span class="nm">1.</span>But if it means 'inn', why does it say that he planted it?</p>
<p class="bas indent1"><span class="nm">(l)</span><span class="cl">Answer:</span> We find such an expression elsewhere - "He will plant the tents of His palace."</p>
<p class="bas indent1"><span class="nm">(m)</span><span class="cl">(Reish Lakish):</span> "Va'Yikra (Avraham called) there in the name of Hash-m, L-rd of the world" - we read this va'Yakri, i.e. he made all passers-by call in Hash-m's name;</p>
<p class="bas bbbline">10b----------------------------------------10b</p>
<p class="bas indent2"><span class="nm">1.</span>After he served a guest food and drink, the guest wanted to bless Avraham.</p>
<p class="bas indent2"><span class="nm">2.</span><span class="cl">Avraham:</span> You did not eat my food. You ate from the G-d of the world! Thank the One who created the world through His word!</p>
<p class="bas indent1"><span class="nm">(n)</span><span class="cl">Question:</span> "Yehudah saw her, and thought that she was a harlot because she covered her face." This is no reason to make him think that she is a harlot!</p>
<p class="bas indent1"><span class="nm">(o)</span><span class="cl">Answer (R. Elazar):</span> He did not recognize her because she had covered her face when in his house (when married to his sons).</p>
<p class="bas indent2"><span class="nm">1.</span><span class="cl">(R. Shmuel bar Nachmani):</span> Any bride who is modest in her father-in-law's house merits that kings and prophets will descend from her. We learn this from Tamar.</p>
<p class="bas indent2"><span class="nm">2.</span>All kings from the house of David descended from her.</p>
<p class="bas indent2"><span class="nm">3.</span>The prophets Yeshayah and his father Amotz descended from her;</p>
<p class="bas indent3"><span class="nm">i.</span><span class="cl">(R. Levi):</span> We have a tradition that Amotz was the brother of Amatzyah (who descended from David).</p>
<p class="bas subject"><span class="nm">4)</span>THE JUDGMENT OF TAMAR</p>
<p class="bas indent1"><span class="nm">(a)</span><span class="cl">Question:</span> Why does it say "she was Mutzeis (found)"? It should say 'Mitutzeis (she was taken forcibly)'!</p>
<p class="bas indent1"><span class="nm">(b)</span><span class="cl">Answer (R. Elazar):</span> It is written Mutzeis, which is spelled as Motza'as (she finds), for Sama'el hid her signs (the deposit she had taken from Yehudah), and Gavri'el brought them back.</p>
<p class="bas indent2"><span class="nm">1.</span><span class="cl">(R. Yochanan):</span> "La'Menatze'ach Al Yonas Elem Rechokim l'David Michtam" - when her signs were Rechokim (distant), she was like a Yonah Ilemes (mute dove, she could not justify herself);</p>
<p class="bas indent3"><span class="nm">i.</span><span class="cl">Explanation #1:</span> "L'David Michtam" - David descended from her, he was MaCH (humble) and <b>TAM</b> (perfect, in his ways) to all.</p>
<p class="bas indent3"><span class="nm">ii.</span><span class="cl">Explanation #2:</span> "Michtam" - his MaKah (the place of circumcision, which is normally wounded) was <b>TAM</b> (immaculate), for he was born circumcised.</p>
<p class="bas indent3"><span class="nm">iii.</span><span class="cl">Explanation #3:</span> "Michtam" - his MaCHus (humility) was <b>TAM</b> (complete), from his youth to his maturity.</p>
<p class="bas indent1"><span class="nm">(c)</span><span class="cl">Question:</span> "She sent to her father-in-law 'I am pregnant from the owner of these.'" Why didn't she say explicitly that it was from Yehudah?</p>
<p class="bas indent1"><span class="nm">(d)</span><span class="cl">Answer (Rav Zutra bar Tuvya):</span> From Tamar, we learn that it is better to cast oneself into a furnace than to humiliate someone in public.</p>
<p class="bas indent1"><span class="nm">(e)</span><span class="cl">(R. Chama bar Chanina):</span> Yehudah told his father "please recognize your son's tunic", therefore he was told "please recognize to whom (are these)."</p>
<p class="bas indent2"><span class="nm">1.</span>"Na" connotes a request - please recognize your Creator, and do not ignore me.</p>
<p class="bas indent1"><span class="nm">(f)</span>"Yehudah recognized and said 'She is (more) righteous than me.'"</p>
<p class="bas indent1"><span class="nm">(g)</span><span class="cl">(Rav Chanan bar Bizna):</span> Yosef sanctified Hash-m's name in private, and he merited that one letter of Hash-m's name was added to his name - "Eidus b'Yehosef Samo";</p>
<p class="bas indent2"><span class="nm">1.</span>Yehudah sanctified Hash-m's name in public, he was (entirely) called by Hash-m's name (with a 'Dalet' added).</p>
<p class="bas indent1"><span class="nm">(h)</span>When he admitted and said "She is (more) righteous than me", a voice from Heaven said 'you saved Tamar and her two children (inside her) from the fire. In your merit, I will save three of your descendants from the fire,'</p>
<p class="bas indent2"><span class="nm">1.</span><span class="cl">Question:</span> Who are these descendants?</p>
<p class="bas indent2"><span class="nm">2.</span><span class="cl">Answer:</span> They are Chananyah, Misha'el and Azaryah (who entered a great fire for refusal to bow to Nevuchadnetzar's statue).</p>
<p class="bas indent1"><span class="nm">(i)</span><span class="cl">Question:</span> "She is righteous, (she is pregnant) from me." How did he know? (Perhaps also others had Bi'ah with her!)</p>
<p class="bas indent1"><span class="nm">(j)</span><span class="cl">Answer:</span> (He said 'she is righteous'.) A voice from Heaven said 'hidden matters came from Me'. (Hash-m caused that she should have children from Yehudah.)</p>
<p class="bas indent1"><span class="nm">(k)</span><span class="cl">(Shmuel the elder):</span> "V'Lo Yasaf Od Ledatah" - he did not desist from her;</p>
<p class="bas indent2"><span class="nm">1.</span>We learn from "Kol Gadol v'Lo Yasaf" (at Matan Torah, Hash-m spoke unceasingly).</p>
<p class="bas subject"><span class="nm">5)</span>AVSHALOM</p>
<p class="bas indent1"><span class="nm">(a)</span><span class="cl">(Beraisa):</span> Avshalom rebelled with his hair - "there was not a man as beautiful (as him)... when he shaved his hair, for it was a burden on him, it weighed 200 Shekalim according to the king's stone;</p>
<p class="bas indent2"><span class="nm">1.</span><span class="cl">(Beraisa):</span> This was a stone that people of Teveriyah and Tzipori used for a unit of weight.</p>
<p class="bas indent1"><span class="nm">(b)</span>Therefore, he was hung by his hair - "... his head was caught in the tree. He was (hanging) between Heaven and earth. The mule under him passed."</p>
<p class="bas indent1"><span class="nm">(c)</span><span class="cl">(Tana d'vei R. Yishmael):</span> He took a sword and wanted to cut his hair. Just them, Gehinom opened up under him.</p>
<p class="bas indent1"><span class="nm">(d)</span><span class="cl">Question:</span> "(David) cried... my son Avshalom, my son, my son, Avshalom, if only I had died in your place, Avshalom my son, my son... my son Avshalom, Avshalom my son, my son." Why did he say "My son" eight times?</p>
<p class="bas indent1"><span class="nm">(e)</span><span class="cl">Answer:</span> Seven times were to save him from the seven chambers of Gehinom;</p>
<p class="bas indent2"><span class="nm">1.</span>Some say that the eighth was to get his head to rejoin his body;</p>
<p class="bas indent2"><span class="nm">2.</span>Others say, it was to bring him to the world to come.</p>
<p class="bas indent1"><span class="nm">(f)</span><span class="cl">Question:</span> "Avshalom took and erected for himself in his life" - what did he take?</p>
<p class="bas indent1"><span class="nm">(g)</span><span class="cl">Answer (Reish Lakish):</span> He made a bad purchase for himself (to try to become king).</p>
<p class="bas indent1"><span class="nm">(h)</span><span class="cl">(R. Chanina bar Papa):</span> "The monument in Emek (valley) of the king" refers to the deep (Amukah) plan of the King of the world - "I will raise evil against you (David) from your house."</p>
