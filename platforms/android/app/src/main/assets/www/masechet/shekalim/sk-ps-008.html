<div class="subject"><span class="nm">1)</span><p>RATIONALE FOR THE DATES OF MA'ASER BEHEIMAH</p></div>
<div class="indent1"><span class="nm">(a)</span><p><span class="cl">(R. Yochanan):</span> The dates account for the times animals give birth.</p></div>
<div class="indent1"><span class="nm">(b)</span><p><span class="cl">(R. Yehoshua b. Levi):</span> That animals would be available for the Olei Regalim.</p></div>
<div class="indent1"><span class="nm">(c)</span><p><span class="cl">(R. Yuden):</span> To prevent violation of Bal Te'acher.</p></div>
<div class="indent2"><span class="nm">1.</span><p>R. Yusah taught that anyone who allows Tevel to linger violates Bal Te'acher.</p></div>
<div class="indent2"><span class="nm">2.</span><p>(Once Chazal instituted the Din Tevel on animals at these seasons, he must bring his animals to avoid Bal Te'acher.)</p></div>
<div class="indent1"><span class="nm">(d)</span><p>We were taught in Bechoros:</p></div>
<div class="indent2"><span class="nm">1.</span><p><span class="cl">(R. Meir):</span> 1 Elul is the cutoff for Ma'aser Beheimah.</p></div>
<div class="indent2"><span class="nm">2.</span><p><span class="cl">(R. Elazer and R. Shimon):</span> The cutoff is 1 Tishrei.</p></div>
<div class="indent2"><span class="nm">3.</span><p><span class="cl">(Ben Azai):</span> The Elul animals are tithed by themselves.</p></div>
<div class="indent1"><span class="nm">(e)</span><p><span class="cl">Question:</span> What is the rationale for R. Meir?</p></div>
<div class="indent1"><span class="nm">(f)</span><p><span class="cl">Answer:</span> (Based on the Pasuk in Tehilim 65:14) Until 1 Elul the animals were conceived before Nisan, and after that point the animals were conceived from Nisan onward.</p></div>
<div class="indent1"><span class="nm">(g)</span><p><span class="cl">Question:</span> What is the rationale for R. Elazar & R. Shimon?</p></div>
<div class="indent1"><span class="nm">(h)</span><p><span class="cl">Answer:</span> They understand the Pasuk as indicating two times for conception, early and late, while both groups are tithed as one.</p></div>
<div class="indent1"><span class="nm">(i)</span><p>Ben Azai maintains that since we cannot determine in favor of one or the other, let the Elul animals be tithed separately.</p></div>
<div class="indent2"><span class="nm">1.</span><p><span class="cl">Question:</span> Does Ben Azai have difficulty deciding between his own students?</p></div>
<div class="indent2"><span class="nm">2.</span><p><span class="cl">Answer:</span> Actually their dispute predates even Ben Azai.</p></div>
<div class="indent2"><span class="nm">3.</span><p>From Ben Azai's language (in two instances) we may infer that he was a Talmid-Chaver (and not a Talmid) of R. Akiva.</p></div>
<div class="subject"><span class="nm">2)</span><p>RECKONING MA'ASER BEHEIMAH</p></div>
<div class="indent1"><span class="nm">(a)</span><p>We see from the Mishnah in Bechoros that regarding Ma'aser Beheimah, we consider the birth, and the cutoff is Rosh HaShanah.</p></div>
<div class="indent2"><span class="nm">1.</span><p>We do not use the criteria of vegetative growth.</p></div>
<div class="indent2"><span class="nm">2.</span><p>These are Chanatah (budding) or a third-grown (Shelish).</p></div>
<div class="indent2"><span class="nm">3.</span><p>If we used Chanatah, we would speak of dates of conception.</p></div>
<div class="indent2"><span class="nm">4.</span><p>If we used Shelish then we would speak of those animals born until 22 Elul (and could be offered before Rosh ha'Shanah).</p></div>
<div class="indent1"><span class="nm">(b)</span><p><span class="cl">(R. Shamai):</span> We use Shelish, and the Mishnah (in Bechoros) follows R. Shimon (who includes in Ma'aser even those animals which are not yet able to be offered).</p></div>
<div class="indent1"><span class="nm">(c)</span><p><span class="cl">Question:</span> Ben Azai must hold like Rabanan, <i>not</i> like R. Shimon!?</p></div>
<div class="indent1"><span class="nm">(d)</span><p>Rather, Ben Azai, like the Rabanan hold that the animal not ready for an offering is counted with the following year.</p></div>
<div class="indent1"><span class="nm">(e)</span><p>The above discussion leads us to count the year for offering a Bechor from its birth (not from 8 days later).</p></div>
<div class="subject"><span class="nm">3)</span><p>THE PROCESS OF TAKING FUNDS FROM THE LISHKAH</p></div>
<div class="indent1"><span class="nm">(a)</span><p>Three boxes were filled with three Se'ah of coins.</p></div>
<div class="indent1"><span class="nm">(b)</span><p>The boxes were designated Alef, Beis and Gimel.</p></div>
<div class="indent1"><span class="nm">(c)</span><p><span class="cl">(R. Yishmael):</span> The designations were Greek; Alpha, Beta, Gama.</p></div>
<div class="indent1"><span class="nm">(d)</span><p>Steps taken to avoid suspicion of the treasurers:</p></div>
<div class="indent2"><span class="nm">1.</span><p>No cuffs on their clothing, no shoes nor sandals, no Tefilin, no Kamea, and we are concerned lest the treasurer become impoverished or wealthy.</p></div>
<div class="indent2"><span class="nm">2.</span><p>A person must avoid suspicion in the eyes of people just as he must uphold the Will of Heaven (2 proof texts).</p></div>
<div class="subject"><span class="nm">4)</span><p>REMOVING THE KUPOS</p></div>
<div class="indent1"><span class="nm">(a)</span><p>We remove Kupos to clear their place.</p></div>
<div class="indent1"><span class="nm">(b)</span><p><span class="cl">Question:</span> What is the measure of the Kupos?</p></div>
<div class="bbbline">8b----------------------------------------8b</p></div>
<div class="indent1"><span class="nm">(c)</span><p><span class="cl">Answer:</span> By inference from a Beraisa that the measure is 3 Se'ah.</p></div>
<div class="subject"><span class="nm">5)</span><p>MARKING THE KUPOS</p></div>
<div class="indent1"><span class="nm">(a)</span><p><span class="cl">Question:</span> Why write the letters upon the Kupos?</p></div>
<div class="indent1"><span class="nm">(b)</span><p><span class="cl">Answer:</span> In order to use the funds in their proper order.</p></div>
<div class="subject"><span class="nm">6)</span><p>THE MEASURE OF A CUP OF WINE</p></div>
<div class="indent1"><span class="nm">(a)</span><p><span class="cl">Question:</span> What is the measure of the cup for which one is Chayav?</p></div>
<div class="indent1"><span class="nm">(b)</span><p><span class="cl">Answer:</span> By inference from a Beraisa (dealing with the four cups on Pesach) we know that it is a Revi'is of Italian wine.</p></div>
<div class="indent1"><span class="nm">(c)</span><p><span class="cl">Question:</span> How large is <i>that</i>?</p></div>
<div class="indent1"><span class="nm">(d)</span><p><span class="cl">Answer:</span> 1.25 Titarton.</p></div>
<div class="subject"><span class="nm">7)</span><p>LAWS OF THE FOUR CUPS</p></div>
<div class="indent1"><span class="nm">(a)</span><p><span class="cl">Question:</span> Is it permitted to drink the four cups at once?</p></div>
<div class="indent1"><span class="nm">(b)</span><p><span class="cl">Answer:</span> He is Yotzei (given R. Yochanan's ruling that one need not repeat Hallel if it was said in the Beis ha'Knesses).</p></div>
<div class="indent1"><span class="nm">(c)</span><p><span class="cl">Question:</span> May one drink the cups with interruptions?</p></div>
<div class="indent1"><span class="nm">(d)</span><p><span class="cl">Answer:</span> He is Yotzei (since it is not intended that he get drunk).</p></div>
<div class="indent1"><span class="nm">(e)</span><p><span class="cl">Question:</span> May he be Yotzei with (prohibited) wine from Shemitah?</p></div>
<div class="indent1"><span class="nm">(f)</span><p><span class="cl">Answer:</span> Yes.</p></div>
<div class="indent1"><span class="nm">(g)</span><p><span class="cl">Question:</span> What about being Yotzei with Konditon?</p></div>
<div class="indent1"><span class="nm">(h)</span><p><span class="cl">Answer:</span> Yes (as we have been taught that Konditon is wine).</p></div>
<div class="indent1"><span class="nm">(i)</span><p><span class="cl">Question:</span> What about (overly) diluted wine?</p></div>
<div class="indent1"><span class="nm">(j)</span><p><span class="cl">Answer:</span> Yes, so long as it still has wine's taste and appearance.</p></div>
<div class="indent1"><span class="nm">(k)</span><p><span class="cl">(R. Yirmiyah):</span> Ideally, one should use red wine (Pasuk).</p></div>
<div class="indent1"><span class="nm">(l)</span><p><span class="cl">Question:</span> How much diluted wine?</p></div>
<div class="indent1"><span class="nm">(m)</span><p><span class="cl">Answer:</span> It is also a Revi'is (as implied above).</p></div>
<div class="indent1"><span class="nm">(n)</span><p><span class="cl">Question:</span> What about cooked wine?</p></div>
<div class="indent1"><span class="nm">(o)</span><p><span class="cl">Answer (R. Yona):</span> One is Yotzei (as if it were spiced-Konditon).</p></div>
<div class="indent2"><span class="nm">1.</span><p>R. Yona is consistent with his position (inasmuch as he could not tolerate wine) in the incident with the matron who commented on his shiny appearance (where he made it clear that he cannot drink wine).</p></div>
<div class="indent2"><span class="nm">2.</span><p>R. Abahu's face shone, as did R. Yona's, because of his delight over a discovery of Torah (in this case a Tosefta).</p></div>
<div class="indent1"><span class="nm">(p)</span><p>The Lug of the Torah is the old measure, now used for fish brine.</p></div>
<div class="indent2"><span class="nm">1.</span><p>R. Yona recalled that this measure was used for honey.</p></div>
<div class="indent2"><span class="nm">2.</span><p><span class="cl">Question:</span> Why was it called an old measure?</p></div>
<div class="indent2"><span class="nm">3.</span><p><span class="cl">Answer:</span> One had to be specific because the original measure was enlarged and was subsequently reduced back.</p></div>
