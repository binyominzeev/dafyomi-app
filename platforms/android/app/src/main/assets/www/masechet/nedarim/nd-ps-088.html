<p class="bas subject"><span class="nm">1)</span>IS A BLIND PERSON EXILED?</p>
<p class="bas indent1"><span class="nm">(a)</span><span class="cl">Answer (Rava):</span> The law of exile is learned from its context, and also the law of vows (Rosh - the part about vows is unnecessary);</p>
<p class="bas indent2"><span class="nm">1.</span>R. Yehudah holds that "who will come with his friend into a forest" includes anyone who can enter a forest, even a blind person. Therefore, we do not need "without seeing" to include a blind person. Rather, it excludes him.</p>
<p class="bas indent2"><span class="nm">2.</span>R. Meir holds that "without knowing" connotes one who could know, i.e. a seeing person';</p>
<p class="bas indent3"><span class="nm">i.</span>Therefore, we do not need "without seeing" to exclude a blind person. Rather, it includes him.</p>
<p class="bas subject"><span class="nm">2)</span>EVADING A VOW</p>
<p class="bas indent1"><span class="nm">(a)</span><span class="cl">(Mishnah):</span> If Reuven vowed not to benefit his son-in-law, and he wants to give his daughter money, he tells her 'this money is a gift to you, on condition that your husband has no Reshus over it. It is given only for you to buy food with it and to eat the food.'</p>
<p class="bas indent1"><span class="nm">(b)</span><span class="cl">(Gemara - Rav):</span> This works only when he says 'it is given only for you to buy food with it and to eat the food.' If he says 'do like you want with it', her husband acquires the money.</p>
<p class="bas indent1"><span class="nm">(c)</span><span class="cl">(Shmuel):</span> Even if he says 'do like you want with it', her husband does not acquire the money.</p>

<p class="bas indent1"><span class="nm">(d)</span><span class="cl">Question (R. Zeira):</span> Here, Rav is like R. Meir, who says that a husband acquires everything his wife gets;</p>
<p class="bas indent2"><span class="nm">1.</span><span class="cl">Contradiction (a Stam Mishnah, which is assumed to be like R. Meir):</span> To make Shituf Mavo'os (an Eruv to permit carrying in an alleyway on Shabbos), one takes a barrel of wine, and says that it should be for everyone whose courtyard opens into the Mavoy;</p>
<p class="bas indent2"><span class="nm">2.</span>Someone else acquires the wine on their behalf. It can be the male or female (Yisrael) slave of the donor, or his adult son or daughter, or his wife.</p>
<p class="bas indent2"><span class="nm">3.</span><span class="cl">(Summation of question):</span> If a husband acquires all that his wife acquires, how can she acquire on behalf of the others? The wine never left the husband's Reshus!</p>
<p class="bas indent1"><span class="nm">(e)</span><span class="cl">Answer #1 (Rava):</span> R. Meir holds that a husband acquires everything his wife gets (from others). Regarding Shituf, since she acquires for them from her husband, she can acquire for others.</p>
<p class="bas indent1"><span class="nm">(f)</span><span class="cl">Objection (Ravina - Beraisa):</span> A person can be Mezakeh to others (make them acquire) through his adult children, or his Hebrew slaves;</p>
<p class="bas indent2"><span class="nm">1.</span>He cannot be Mezakeh through his minor children, his Kena'ani slaves, or through his wife.</p>
<p class="bas indent1"><span class="nm">(g)</span><span class="cl">Answer #2 (Rav Ashi):</span> The Mishnah (regarding a Mavoy) discusses when his wife owns a courtyard that opens into the Mavoy;</p>
<p class="bas indent2"><span class="nm">1.</span>Since she can acquire the wine for herself, she can acquire it also for the others.</p>
