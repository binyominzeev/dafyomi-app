<p class="bas subject"><span class="nm">1)</span><i>SIMANIM</i> THAT CHANGE AFTER DEATH</p>
<p class="bas indent1"><span class="nm">(a)</span><span class="cl">Question:</span> What difference is there are between the two concerns?</p>
<p class="bas indent1"><span class="nm">(b)</span><span class="cl">Answer #1:</span> He was slaughtered in a marble house (there is no wind) and moved before dying.</p>
<p class="bas indent1"><span class="nm">(c)</span><span class="cl">Answer #2:</span> He was slaughtered outside, and did not move.</p>
<p class="bas indent1"><span class="nm">(d)</span><span class="cl">(Mishnah - R. Yehudah ben Bava):</span> It depends on the deceased...</p>
<p class="bas indent1"><span class="nm">(e)</span><span class="cl">Question:</span> Does he allow more time to identify the body, or less?</p>
<p class="bas indent1"><span class="nm">(f)</span><span class="cl">Answer:</span> A man drowned and his body was recovered after three days. Rav Dimi of Nehardai permitted his wife to remarry. A man drowned in the Diglas River and his body was recovered after five days. Rava permitted his wife to remarry.</p>
<p class="bas indent2"><span class="nm">1.</span>Granted, if R. Yehudah allows more time, these Amora'im hold like him. However, if R. Yehudah allows less time, like whom did they rule?</p>
<p class="bas indent1"><span class="nm">(g)</span><span class="cl">Rejection:</span> A body in water may be recognized for more time, for water prevents swelling and distortion of the face.</p>
<p class="bas indent1"><span class="nm">(h)</span><span class="cl">Question:</span> Above we said that water aggravates a wound!</p>
<p class="bas indent1"><span class="nm">(i)</span><span class="cl">Answer:</span> When there is a wound, it aggravates it. When there is no wound, it preserves the body.</p>
<p class="bas indent2"><span class="nm">1.</span>This is only if he was seen right after removal from the water. If there was a delay, he swells up and changes.</p>
<p class="bas subject"><span class="nm">2)</span>ONE WHO FELL INTO WATER</p>
<p class="bas indent1"><span class="nm">(a)</span><span class="cl">(Mishnah):</span> If a man fell into water, whether or not it is endless (this will be explained), his wife is forbidden;</p>
<p class="bas indent1"><span class="nm">(b)</span><span class="cl">R. Meir:</span> A man fell into the great reservoir, and he came out after three days.</p>
<p class="bas indent1"><span class="nm">(c)</span><span class="cl">R. Yosi:</span> A blind man went to immerse in a cave; the man leading him went after him. People with them waited until they surely drowned, and their wives were permitted to remarry.</p>
<p class="bas indent1"><span class="nm">(d)</span>A case occurred in Asya in which a man was lowered into water. When they lifted him, only his leg came up. Chachamim ruled that his wife may remarry only if more than the knee came up.</p>
<p class="bas indent1"><span class="nm">(e)</span><span class="cl">(Gemara - Beraisa - R. Meir):</span> If a man fell into water, whether or not it is endless, his wife is forbidden;</p>
<p class="bas indent1"><span class="nm">(f)</span>Chachamim say, she is forbidden only if it is endless.</p>
<p class="bas indent1"><span class="nm">(g)</span><span class="cl">Question:</span> What is considered water with an end?</p>
<p class="bas indent1"><span class="nm">(h)</span><span class="cl">Answer (Abaye):</span> A person can see the shore in all four directions.</p>
<p class="bas indent1"><span class="nm">(i)</span>A man drowned in the swamp of Samki; Rav Shilo permitted his wife to remarry. Rav wanted to excommunicate him; Shmuel said that they should ask him first.</p>
<p class="bas indent2"><span class="nm">1.</span>Rav and Shmuel asked him 'What is the law of endless water?' He answered that the wife is forbidden.</p>
<p class="bas indent2"><span class="nm">2.</span>They asked if the swamp of Samki is considered endless; he said that it is.</p>
<p class="bas indent2"><span class="nm">3.</span><span class="cl">Rav and Shmuel:</span> Why did you permit the woman?</p>
<p class="bas indent2"><span class="nm">4.</span><span class="cl">Rav Shilo:</span> I erred. I thought that since the water does not flow, it is like endless water;</p>
<p class="bas indent3"><span class="nm">i.</span>This is wrong. There are waves, and these could take him far away (beyond vision of the witnesses).</p>
<p class="bas indent1"><span class="nm">(j)</span><span class="cl">Shmuel:</span> "Sin will not occur to a Tzadik" (Hash-m prevented Rav from unjustly excommunicating R. Shilo).</p>
<p class="bas indent1"><span class="nm">(k)</span><span class="cl">Rav:</span> "Salvation comes through much counsel."</p>
<p class="bas indent1"><span class="nm">(l)</span><span class="cl">(Beraisa - Rebbi):</span> A case occurred in which Reuven and Shimon were setting fish traps in the Yarden. Reuven entered a hole to catch fish. The sun set, and he could not find the opening. Shimon waited until he surely drowned, and informed Reuven's family of his death.</p>
<p class="bas indent2"><span class="nm">1.</span>In the morning, Reuven saw the opening and returned home, where they were eulogizing him.</p>
<p class="bas indent2"><span class="nm">2.</span><span class="cl">Rebbi:</span> How great are the words of Chachamim, who said that if the water has an end his wife is permitted, but if it is endless she is forbidden!</p>
<p class="bas indent1"><span class="nm">(m)</span><span class="cl">Question:</span> Even if it has an end, we should be concerned for a fishing hole!</p>
<p class="bas indent1"><span class="nm">(n)</span><span class="cl">Answer:</span> Fishing holes are not common in water with an end.</p>
<p class="bas indent1"><span class="nm">(o)</span><span class="cl">(Rav Ashi):</span> Chachamim say that if the water is endless, she is forbidden. This refers to a regular person, but if a Chacham died, she is permitted. Had he survived, word would spread.</p>
<p class="bas indent1"><span class="nm">(p)</span>This is wrong. Whether or not he is a Chacham, if he fell in endless water, l'Chatchilah, his wife may not remarry. B'Di'eved, if she remarried, she may stay married.</p>
<p class="bas indent1"><span class="nm">(q)</span><span class="cl">(Beraisa - R. Gamliel):</span> Once, I was on a boat and I saw a boat sink. I was distressed, for R. Akiva was on the boat. When I got to the dry land, I saw him learning.</p>
<p class="bas indent2"><span class="nm">1.</span><span class="cl">R. Gamliel:</span> How did you get to the land?</p>
<p class="bas indent2"><span class="nm">2.</span><span class="cl">R. Akiva:</span> I found a board of the boat (and floated on it). Every time a wave came (to submerge it), I nodded my head to the wave (and it went away).</p>
<p class="bas indent2"><span class="nm">3.</span>Chachamim learned from here that if Resha'im come to a person, he should nod his head (and not confront them).</p>
<p class="bas indent1"><span class="nm">(r)</span><span class="cl">R. Gamliel:</span> How great are the words of Chachamim, who said that his wife is permitted only if the water has an end!</p>
<p class="bas indent1"><span class="nm">(s)</span><span class="cl">(Beraisa - R. Akiva):</span> Once, I was on a boat, and I saw a boat sink. I was distressed, for R. Meir was on the boat. When I got to the dry land, I saw him learning.</p>
<p class="bas indent2"><span class="nm">1.</span><span class="cl">R. Akiva:</span> How did you reach the land?</p>
<p class="bas indent2"><span class="nm">2.</span><span class="cl">R. Meir:</span> One wave carried me to the next wave, and the next to the next, until I was deposited on the land.</p>
<p class="bas indent2"><span class="nm">3.</span><span class="cl">R. Akiva:</span> How great are the words of Chachamim, who said that his wife is permitted only if the water has an end!</p>
<p class="bas subject"><span class="nm">3)</span>WHEN MAY WE TESTIFY THAT A MAN DIED?</p>
<p class="bas indent1"><span class="nm">(a)</span><span class="cl">(Beraisa):</span> If a man fell into a den of lions, we may not testify about him (that he died). If he fell into a pit of snakes and scorpions, we may testify;</p>
<p class="bas indent1"><span class="nm">(b)</span>R. Yehudah ben Beseirah says, even if he fell into a pit of snakes and scorpions, we may not testify. Perhaps he is a snake charmer!</p>
<p class="bas bbbline">121b----------------------------------------121b</p>
<p class="bas indent2"><span class="nm">1.</span>Chachamim holds that since there is no room, he steps on them and they harm him.</p>
<p class="bas indent1"><span class="nm">(c)</span><span class="cl">(Beraisa):</span> If a man fell into a furnace, we may testify about him;</p>
<p class="bas indent1"><span class="nm">(d)</span>If he fell into a cauldron of [boiling] wine or oil, we may testify;</p>
<p class="bas indent1"><span class="nm">(e)</span>R. Acha says, if he fell into oil, we may testify, since oil burns. If he fell into wine we may not testify, since it extinguishes the flame (underneath when it splashes).</p>
<p class="bas indent2"><span class="nm">1.</span>Chachamim At first it (partly) extinguishes, but later, it burns.</p>
<p class="bas indent1"><span class="nm">(f)</span><span class="cl">(Mishnah - R. Meir):</span> A man fell into the great reservoir (and came out after three days).</p>
<p class="bas indent1"><span class="nm">(g)</span><span class="cl">(Beraisa - Chachamim (to R. Meir)):</span> We cannot bring a proof from miracles.</p>
<p class="bas indent1"><span class="nm">(h)</span><span class="cl">Question:</span> What was the miracle?</p>
<p class="bas indent2"><span class="nm">1.</span><span class="cl">Suggestion:</span> He survived without eating or drinking for three days.</p>
<p class="bas indent2"><span class="nm">2.</span><span class="cl">Rejection:</span> This is not a miracle. All the Yisraelim in Shushan fasted three days on Esther's command!</p>
<p class="bas indent1"><span class="nm">(i)</span><span class="cl">Answer:</span> He went three days without sleeping.</p>
<p class="bas indent2"><span class="nm">1.</span><span class="cl">(R. Yochanan):</span> If a man swore that he will not sleep for three days (this is a vain oath, for this is impossible) he is lashed immediately. He may sleep when he wants.</p>
<p class="bas indent1"><span class="nm">(j)</span><span class="cl">Question:</span> What is R. Meir's reason?</p>
<p class="bas indent1"><span class="nm">(k)</span><span class="cl">Answer (Rav Kahana):</span> There were structures for him to sleep on;</p>
<p class="bas indent2"><span class="nm">1.</span>Chachamim hold that since they were of marble, he would slip and could not sleep.</p>
<p class="bas indent2"><span class="nm">2.</span>R. Meir holds that he could sleep for a short time.</p>
<p class="bas indent1"><span class="nm">(l)</span><span class="cl">(Beraisa):</span> The daughter of Nechunya the reservoir-digger fell into a reservoir. They informed R. Chanina ben Dosa. The first hour he said 'Shalom'; also, the second hour. The third hour, he said that she has already escaped.</p>
<p class="bas indent2"><span class="nm">1.</span><span class="cl">R. Chanina ben Dosa:</span> Who took you out?</p>
<p class="bas indent2"><span class="nm">2.</span><span class="cl">The girl:</span> There was a ram, and an old man leading it.</p>
<p class="bas indent2"><span class="nm">3.</span><span class="cl">Rabanan (to R. Chanina ben Dosa):</span> Are you a prophet?</p>
<p class="bas indent2"><span class="nm">4.</span><span class="cl">R. Chanina ben Dosa:</span> I am not a prophet, nor the Talmid (or son) of a prophet. I knew that since Nechunya toiled for this, his seed would not die through it.</p>
<p class="bas indent1"><span class="nm">(m)</span><span class="cl">(R. Aba):</span> Nevertheless, his son died of thirst;</p>
<p class="bas indent2"><span class="nm">1.</span>"U'Svivav NiS'ARaH Me'od" - Hash-m is exacting with His Tzadikim like a Sa'ARaH (hair).</p>
<p class="bas indent2"><span class="nm">2.</span><span class="cl">R. Chanina:</span> We learn this from "Hash-m is feared among the Holy, and awesome among all around Him."</p>
<p class="bas subject"><span class="nm">4)</span>SECOND-HAND TESTIMONY OF A DEATH</p>
<p class="bas indent1"><span class="nm">(a)</span><span class="cl">(Mishnah):</span> Even if Reuven heard women saying 'Ploni died' (he may testify that Ploni died);</p>
<p class="bas indent1"><span class="nm">(b)</span>R. Yehudah says, even if he heard children saying 'we are going to bury and eulogize Ploni'.</p>
<p class="bas indent1"><span class="nm">(c)</span>It doesn't matter whether or not the one who mentioned his death intended to testify;</p>
<p class="bas indent1"><span class="nm">(d)</span>R. Yehudah ben Bava says, we rely on a Yisrael (who said that Ploni died) said even if he intended to testify. We rely on a Nochri only if he did not intend to testify.</p>
<p class="bas indent1"><span class="nm">(e)</span><span class="cl">(Gemara) Question:</span> Perhaps the children never went to the funeral (and he did not die)!</p>
<p class="bas indent1"><span class="nm">(f)</span><span class="cl">Answer (Rav Yehudah):</span> They said 'we are coming <i>from</i> eulogizing and burying Ploni.'</p>
<p class="bas indent1"><span class="nm">(g)</span><span class="cl">Question:</span> Perhaps they buried an ant, and named it Ploni!</p>
<p class="bas indent1"><span class="nm">(h)</span><span class="cl">Answer:</span> They mentioned the number of Chachamim and eulogizers who were there.</p>
<p class="bas indent1"><span class="nm">(i)</span><span class="cl">(Mishnah - R. Yehudah ben Bava):</span> If a Nochri intended to testify, we may not rely on this.</p>
<p class="bas indent1"><span class="nm">(j)</span><span class="cl">(Rav Yehudah and Reish Lakish):</span> This is only if he intended to permit. If he intended (only) to testify, he is believed.</p>
<p class="bas indent1"><span class="nm">(k)</span><span class="cl">Question:</span> How do we know his intention?</p>
<p class="bas indent1"><span class="nm">(l)</span><span class="cl">Answer (Rav Yosef):</span> If he comes to Beis Din and says 'Ploni died; let his wife remarry', he intends to permit. If he says only 'Ploni died', he intends to testify.</p>
<p class="bas indent1"><span class="nm">(m)</span><span class="cl">Question (R. Yochanan, against Reish Lakish):</span> A case occurred in which Oshaya b'Ribi said like you, and 85 Chachamim opposed him.</p>
<p class="bas indent2"><span class="nm">1.</span><span class="cl">Question:</span> If he is never believed with intention, when is he believed? (The Mishnah implies that sometimes he is believed!)</p>
<p class="bas indent2"><span class="nm">2.</span><span class="cl">Answer:</span> He is believed when he speaks l'Fi Tumo (unaware of consequences of his words).</p>
<p class="bas indent1"><span class="nm">(n)</span>A Nochri was saying 'Who is from Chivai's house? Who is from Chivai's house? Chivai died!' Rav Yosef permitted his wife to remarry.</p>
<p class="bas indent1"><span class="nm">(o)</span>A Nochri was saying 'Woe to the valiant soldier of Pumbadisa who died'. Rav Yosef (or Rava) permitted his wife.</p>
<p class="bas indent1"><span class="nm">(p)</span>A Nochri was saying, 'Who is from Chasa's house? Chasa drowned!'</p>
<p class="bas indent2"><span class="nm">1.</span><span class="cl">Version #1 - Rav Nachman:</span> Ha'Elokim (this resembles an oath)! Fish ate Chasa!</p>
<p class="bas indent2"><span class="nm">2.</span>Chasa's wife remarried based on hearing Rav Nachman say this. No one commented.</p>
<p class="bas indent2"><span class="nm">3.</span><span class="cl">Inference (Rav Ashi):</span> This shows that the Isur to remarry when a man fell into endless water is only l'Chatchilah. B'Di'eved, if she remarried she may remain married.</p>
