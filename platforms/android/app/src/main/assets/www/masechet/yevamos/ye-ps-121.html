<div class="indent1"><span class="nm">(a)</span><p><span class="cl">Question:</span> What difference is there are between the two concerns?</p></div>
<div class="indent1"><span class="nm">(b)</span><p><span class="cl">Answer #1:</span> He was slaughtered in a marble house (there is no wind) and moved before dying.</p></div>
<div class="indent1"><span class="nm">(c)</span><p><span class="cl">Answer #2:</span> He was slaughtered outside, and did not move.</p></div>
<div class="indent1"><span class="nm">(d)</span><p><span class="cl">(Mishnah - R. Yehudah ben Bava):</span> It depends on the deceased...</p></div>
<div class="indent1"><span class="nm">(e)</span><p><span class="cl">Question:</span> Does he allow more time to identify the body, or less?</p></div>
<div class="indent1"><span class="nm">(f)</span><p><span class="cl">Answer:</span> A man drowned and his body was recovered after three days. Rav Dimi of Nehardai permitted his wife to remarry. A man drowned in the Diglas River and his body was recovered after five days. Rava permitted his wife to remarry.</p></div>
<div class="indent2"><span class="nm">1.</span><p>Granted, if R. Yehudah allows more time, these Amora'im hold like him. However, if R. Yehudah allows less time, like whom did they rule?</p></div>
<div class="indent1"><span class="nm">(g)</span><p><span class="cl">Rejection:</span> A body in water may be recognized for more time, for water prevents swelling and distortion of the face.</p></div>
<div class="indent1"><span class="nm">(h)</span><p><span class="cl">Question:</span> Above we said that water aggravates a wound!</p></div>
<div class="indent1"><span class="nm">(i)</span><p><span class="cl">Answer:</span> When there is a wound, it aggravates it. When there is no wound, it preserves the body.</p></div>
<div class="indent2"><span class="nm">1.</span><p>This is only if he was seen right after removal from the water. If there was a delay, he swells up and changes.</p></div>
<div class="subject"><span class="nm">2)</span><p>ONE WHO FELL INTO WATER</p></div>
<div class="indent1"><span class="nm">(a)</span><p><span class="cl">(Mishnah):</span> If a man fell into water, whether or not it is endless (this will be explained), his wife is forbidden;</p></div>
<div class="indent1"><span class="nm">(b)</span><p><span class="cl">R. Meir:</span> A man fell into the great reservoir, and he came out after three days.</p></div>
<div class="indent1"><span class="nm">(c)</span><p><span class="cl">R. Yosi:</span> A blind man went to immerse in a cave; the man leading him went after him. People with them waited until they surely drowned, and their wives were permitted to remarry.</p></div>
<div class="indent1"><span class="nm">(d)</span><p>A case occurred in Asya in which a man was lowered into water. When they lifted him, only his leg came up. Chachamim ruled that his wife may remarry only if more than the knee came up.</p></div>
<div class="indent1"><span class="nm">(e)</span><p><span class="cl">(Gemara - Beraisa - R. Meir):</span> If a man fell into water, whether or not it is endless, his wife is forbidden;</p></div>
<div class="indent1"><span class="nm">(f)</span><p>Chachamim say, she is forbidden only if it is endless.</p></div>
<div class="indent1"><span class="nm">(g)</span><p><span class="cl">Question:</span> What is considered water with an end?</p></div>
<div class="indent1"><span class="nm">(h)</span><p><span class="cl">Answer (Abaye):</span> A person can see the shore in all four directions.</p></div>
<div class="indent1"><span class="nm">(i)</span><p>A man drowned in the swamp of Samki; Rav Shilo permitted his wife to remarry. Rav wanted to excommunicate him; Shmuel said that they should ask him first.</p></div>
<div class="indent2"><span class="nm">1.</span><p>Rav and Shmuel asked him 'What is the law of endless water?' He answered that the wife is forbidden.</p></div>
<div class="indent2"><span class="nm">2.</span><p>They asked if the swamp of Samki is considered endless; he said that it is.</p></div>
<div class="indent2"><span class="nm">3.</span><p><span class="cl">Rav and Shmuel:</span> Why did you permit the woman?</p></div>
<div class="indent2"><span class="nm">4.</span><p><span class="cl">Rav Shilo:</span> I erred. I thought that since the water does not flow, it is like endless water;</p></div>
<div class="indent3"><span class="nm">i.</span><p>This is wrong. There are waves, and these could take him far away (beyond vision of the witnesses).</p></div>
<div class="indent1"><span class="nm">(j)</span><p><span class="cl">Shmuel:</span> "Sin will not occur to a Tzadik" (Hash-m prevented Rav from unjustly excommunicating R. Shilo).</p></div>
<div class="indent1"><span class="nm">(k)</span><p><span class="cl">Rav:</span> "Salvation comes through much counsel."</p></div>
<div class="indent1"><span class="nm">(l)</span><p><span class="cl">(Beraisa - Rebbi):</span> A case occurred in which Reuven and Shimon were setting fish traps in the Yarden. Reuven entered a hole to catch fish. The sun set, and he could not find the opening. Shimon waited until he surely drowned, and informed Reuven's family of his death.</p></div>
<div class="indent2"><span class="nm">1.</span><p>In the morning, Reuven saw the opening and returned home, where they were eulogizing him.</p></div>
<div class="indent2"><span class="nm">2.</span><p><span class="cl">Rebbi:</span> How great are the words of Chachamim, who said that if the water has an end his wife is permitted, but if it is endless she is forbidden!</p></div>
<div class="indent1"><span class="nm">(m)</span><p><span class="cl">Question:</span> Even if it has an end, we should be concerned for a fishing hole!</p></div>
<div class="indent1"><span class="nm">(n)</span><p><span class="cl">Answer:</span> Fishing holes are not common in water with an end.</p></div>
<div class="indent1"><span class="nm">(o)</span><p><span class="cl">(Rav Ashi):</span> Chachamim say that if the water is endless, she is forbidden. This refers to a regular person, but if a Chacham died, she is permitted. Had he survived, word would spread.</p></div>
<div class="indent1"><span class="nm">(p)</span><p>This is wrong. Whether or not he is a Chacham, if he fell in endless water, l'Chatchilah, his wife may not remarry. B'Di'eved, if she remarried, she may stay married.</p></div>
<div class="indent1"><span class="nm">(q)</span><p><span class="cl">(Beraisa - R. Gamliel):</span> Once, I was on a boat and I saw a boat sink. I was distressed, for R. Akiva was on the boat. When I got to the dry land, I saw him learning.</p></div>
<div class="indent2"><span class="nm">1.</span><p><span class="cl">R. Gamliel:</span> How did you get to the land?</p></div>
<div class="indent2"><span class="nm">2.</span><p><span class="cl">R. Akiva:</span> I found a board of the boat (and floated on it). Every time a wave came (to submerge it), I nodded my head to the wave (and it went away).</p></div>
<div class="indent2"><span class="nm">3.</span><p>Chachamim learned from here that if Resha'im come to a person, he should nod his head (and not confront them).</p></div>
<div class="indent1"><span class="nm">(r)</span><p><span class="cl">R. Gamliel:</span> How great are the words of Chachamim, who said that his wife is permitted only if the water has an end!</p></div>
<div class="indent1"><span class="nm">(s)</span><p><span class="cl">(Beraisa - R. Akiva):</span> Once, I was on a boat, and I saw a boat sink. I was distressed, for R. Meir was on the boat. When I got to the dry land, I saw him learning.</p></div>
<div class="indent2"><span class="nm">1.</span><p><span class="cl">R. Akiva:</span> How did you reach the land?</p></div>
<div class="indent2"><span class="nm">2.</span><p><span class="cl">R. Meir:</span> One wave carried me to the next wave, and the next to the next, until I was deposited on the land.</p></div>
<div class="indent2"><span class="nm">3.</span><p><span class="cl">R. Akiva:</span> How great are the words of Chachamim, who said that his wife is permitted only if the water has an end!</p></div>
<div class="subject"><span class="nm">3)</span><p>WHEN MAY WE TESTIFY THAT A MAN DIED?</p></div>
<div class="indent1"><span class="nm">(a)</span><p><span class="cl">(Beraisa):</span> If a man fell into a den of lions, we may not testify about him (that he died). If he fell into a pit of snakes and scorpions, we may testify;</p></div>
<div class="indent1"><span class="nm">(b)</span><p>R. Yehudah ben Beseirah says, even if he fell into a pit of snakes and scorpions, we may not testify. Perhaps he is a snake charmer!</p></div>
<div class="bbbline">121b----------------------------------------121b</p></div>
<div class="indent2"><span class="nm">1.</span><p>Chachamim holds that since there is no room, he steps on them and they harm him.</p></div>
<div class="indent1"><span class="nm">(c)</span><p><span class="cl">(Beraisa):</span> If a man fell into a furnace, we may testify about him;</p></div>
<div class="indent1"><span class="nm">(d)</span><p>If he fell into a cauldron of [boiling] wine or oil, we may testify;</p></div>
<div class="indent1"><span class="nm">(e)</span><p>R. Acha says, if he fell into oil, we may testify, since oil burns. If he fell into wine we may not testify, since it extinguishes the flame (underneath when it splashes).</p></div>
<div class="indent2"><span class="nm">1.</span><p>Chachamim At first it (partly) extinguishes, but later, it burns.</p></div>
<div class="indent1"><span class="nm">(f)</span><p><span class="cl">(Mishnah - R. Meir):</span> A man fell into the great reservoir (and came out after three days).</p></div>
<div class="indent1"><span class="nm">(g)</span><p><span class="cl">(Beraisa - Chachamim (to R. Meir)):</span> We cannot bring a proof from miracles.</p></div>
<div class="indent1"><span class="nm">(h)</span><p><span class="cl">Question:</span> What was the miracle?</p></div>
<div class="indent2"><span class="nm">1.</span><p><span class="cl">Suggestion:</span> He survived without eating or drinking for three days.</p></div>
<div class="indent2"><span class="nm">2.</span><p><span class="cl">Rejection:</span> This is not a miracle. All the Yisraelim in Shushan fasted three days on Esther's command!</p></div>
<div class="indent1"><span class="nm">(i)</span><p><span class="cl">Answer:</span> He went three days without sleeping.</p></div>
<div class="indent2"><span class="nm">1.</span><p><span class="cl">(R. Yochanan):</span> If a man swore that he will not sleep for three days (this is a vain oath, for this is impossible) he is lashed immediately. He may sleep when he wants.</p></div>
<div class="indent1"><span class="nm">(j)</span><p><span class="cl">Question:</span> What is R. Meir's reason?</p></div>
<div class="indent1"><span class="nm">(k)</span><p><span class="cl">Answer (Rav Kahana):</span> There were structures for him to sleep on;</p></div>
<div class="indent2"><span class="nm">1.</span><p>Chachamim hold that since they were of marble, he would slip and could not sleep.</p></div>
<div class="indent2"><span class="nm">2.</span><p>R. Meir holds that he could sleep for a short time.</p></div>
<div class="indent1"><span class="nm">(l)</span><p><span class="cl">(Beraisa):</span> The daughter of Nechunya the reservoir-digger fell into a reservoir. They informed R. Chanina ben Dosa. The first hour he said 'Shalom'; also, the second hour. The third hour, he said that she has already escaped.</p></div>
<div class="indent2"><span class="nm">1.</span><p><span class="cl">R. Chanina ben Dosa:</span> Who took you out?</p></div>
<div class="indent2"><span class="nm">2.</span><p><span class="cl">The girl:</span> There was a ram, and an old man leading it.</p></div>
<div class="indent2"><span class="nm">3.</span><p><span class="cl">Rabanan (to R. Chanina ben Dosa):</span> Are you a prophet?</p></div>
<div class="indent2"><span class="nm">4.</span><p><span class="cl">R. Chanina ben Dosa:</span> I am not a prophet, nor the Talmid (or son) of a prophet. I knew that since Nechunya toiled for this, his seed would not die through it.</p></div>
<div class="indent1"><span class="nm">(m)</span><p><span class="cl">(R. Aba):</span> Nevertheless, his son died of thirst;</p></div>
<div class="indent2"><span class="nm">1.</span><p>"U'Svivav NiS'ARaH Me'od" - Hash-m is exacting with His Tzadikim like a Sa'ARaH (hair).</p></div>

<div class="subject"><span class="nm">4)</span><p>SECOND-HAND TESTIMONY OF A DEATH</p></div>
<div class="indent1"><span class="nm">(a)</span><p><span class="cl">(Mishnah):</span> Even if Reuven heard women saying 'Ploni died' (he may testify that Ploni died);</p></div>
<div class="indent1"><span class="nm">(b)</span><p>R. Yehudah says, even if he heard children saying 'we are going to bury and eulogize Ploni'.</p></div>
<div class="indent1"><span class="nm">(c)</span><p>It doesn't matter whether or not the one who mentioned his death intended to testify;</p></div>
<div class="indent1"><span class="nm">(d)</span><p>R. Yehudah ben Bava says, we rely on a Yisrael (who said that Ploni died) said even if he intended to testify. We rely on a Nochri only if he did not intend to testify.</p></div>

<div class="indent1"><span class="nm">(j)</span><p><span class="cl">(Rav Yehudah and Reish Lakish):</span> This is only if he intended to permit. If he intended (only) to testify, he is believed.</p></div>
<div class="indent1"><span class="nm">(k)</span><p><span class="cl">Question:</span> How do we know his intention?</p></div>
<div class="indent1"><span class="nm">(l)</span><p><span class="cl">Answer (Rav Yosef):</span> If he comes to Beis Din and says 'Ploni died; let his wife remarry', he intends to permit. If he says only 'Ploni died', he intends to testify.</p></div>
