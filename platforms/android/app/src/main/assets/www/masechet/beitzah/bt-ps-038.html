<div class="subject"><span class="nm">1)</span><p>TECHUM SHABBOS (cont.)</p></div>
<div class="indent1"><span class="nm">(a)</span><p><span class="cl">(Shmuel):</span> An ox that has been fattened for sale assumes the Techum of whomever purchases it (from whichever town) while privately owned oxen (which are sometimes sold to local people) assumes the Techum of the local townspeople (the owner already placed it before Yom Tov in the domain of the prospective buyer).</p></div>
<div class="indent1"><span class="nm">(b)</span><p><span class="cl">(Mishnah):</span> If someone borrows a vessel on Erev Yom Tov, the vessel follows the Techum of the borrower.</p></div>
<div class="indent2"><span class="nm">1.</span><p><span class="cl">Question:</span> Is this not obvious?</p></div>
<div class="indent2"><span class="nm">2.</span><p><span class="cl">Answer:</span> We might have prohibited where the owner agreed to lend him the vessels on Erev Yom Tov, but he only received it on Yom Tov.</p></div>
<div class="indent2"><span class="nm">3.</span><p>This supports the teaching of R. Yochanan.</p></div>
<div class="indent1"><span class="nm">(c)</span><p><span class="cl">(Mishnah):</span> Vessels borrowed on Yom Tov follow the lender.</p></div>
<div class="indent2"><span class="nm">1.</span><p><span class="cl">Question:</span> Without even a verbal assurance to the borrower before Yom Tov, this is surely obvious!?</p></div>
<div class="indent2"><span class="nm">2.</span><p><span class="cl">Answer:</span> We might have placed it in the Techum of the borrower in a case where the owner was accustomed to lending him those vessels.</p></div>
<div class="subject"><span class="nm">2)</span><p>BITUL - THE COMPLEX INCIDENT OF R. ABA IN ERETZ YISRAEL</p></div>
<div class="indent1"><span class="nm">(a)</span><p><span class="cl">(Mishnah):</span> A woman borrowed spices, salt and water...</p></div>
<div class="indent1"><span class="nm">(b)</span><p><span class="cl">Question (Amoraim of Eretz Yisrael):</span> Why aren't those ingredients Batel to the dish for the purposes of Techumin?</p></div>
<div class="bbbline">38b----------------------------------------38b</p></div>
<div class="indent1"><span class="nm">(c)</span><p><span class="cl">Answer (R. Aba, hoping to be favorably received):</span> This case is akin to a case where one Kav of Reuven's wheat fell into ten Kabin of Shimon's wheat (and which is obviously not Batel).</p></div>
<div class="indent2"><span class="nm">1.</span><p>The Amoraim laughed at his answer and still more at his challenge to their laughter.</p></div>
<div class="indent2"><span class="nm">2.</span><p><span class="cl">(R. Oshaya):</span> Their laughter was justified.</p></div>
<div class="indent3"><span class="nm">i.</span><p>The proper analogy is to wheat and barley where even he had to admit that one kind is Batel (even ownership) in another.</p></div>
<div class="indent3"><span class="nm">ii.</span><p>Even wheat in wheat is Batel according to the Rabanan of R. Yehudah, who hold Min b'Mino is Batel.</p></div>
<div class="indent2"><span class="nm">3.</span><p><span class="cl">Question (R. Safra):</span> But R. Aba was correct, since the Bitul you are speaking of is only where there is Isur, not simply any mixture (which was R. Aba's point)!?</p></div>
<div class="indent2"><span class="nm">4.</span><p><span class="cl">Answer:</span> Perhaps such tiny amounts (as the spices, water and salt) should be Batel anyway?</p></div>
<div class="indent2"><span class="nm">5.</span><p><span class="cl">Question:</span> But R. Chiya taught (citing Rav) that someone who picks stones from his friend's granary is obligated to pay him, as if he had removed wheat (even though the amount is small)!?</p></div>
<div class="indent2"><span class="nm">6.</span><p><span class="cl">Answer (Abaye):</span> The case of the dough is not comparable to picking stones from the granary since there, the money (i.e. the stones) has a claimant, whereas the water and the salt (which the owner gave her friend) do not.</p></div>
<div class="indent2"><span class="nm">7.</span><p><span class="cl">Question (acc. to Rashi: R. Safra):</span> But the concept of Bitul does not hinge on ownership (We see R. Chisda making a distinction between whether one Min may become like the other (as in the case of Neveilah falling into Shechutah) and he does not distinguish between ownership)!?</p></div>
<div class="indent2"><span class="nm">8.</span><p><span class="cl">Answer:</span> Perhaps if the Neveilah had no owner it would indeed not be Batel!?</p></div>
<div class="indent2"><span class="nm">9.</span><p><span class="cl">Question:</span> R. Yochanan b. Nuris has already taught that objects have a certain independence even if they have no owner who is claiming them (objects of Hefker acquire Shevisah as if they had an owner).</p></div>
<div class="indent2"><span class="nm">10.</span><p><span class="cl">Answer (Abaye):</span> Still, the differentiation must be made between money (the pebbles in the wheat) and Isur (Techum)!?</p></div>
<div class="indent1"><span class="nm">(d)</span><p><span class="cl">Question:</span> What, then, is the real reason for the Din that the ingredients are not Batel?</p></div>
<div class="indent1"><span class="nm">(e)</span><p><span class="cl">Answer (Abaye):</span> It is a decree lest they make a dough in partnership (and misapply the Din of Bitul).</p></div>
<div class="indent1"><span class="nm">(f)</span><p><span class="cl">Additional Answer (Rava):</span> It is because spices are made specifically to give taste, and whatever is added for taste, cannot become Batel.</p></div>
<div class="indent1"><span class="nm">(g)</span><p><span class="cl">Answer (R. Ashi):</span> The ingredients are not Batel because they are a Davar sheYesh Lo Matirin.</p></div>
