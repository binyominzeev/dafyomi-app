<p class="bas subject"><span class="nm">1)</span>WHEN MAY <i>MI'UN</i> BE DONE?</p>
<p class="bas indent1"><span class="nm">(a)</span><span class="cl">(Mishnah - Beis Shamai):</span> A girl (an orphaned minor married mid'Rabanan) can do Mi'un (retroactively undo the marriage) only during Eirusin;</p>
<p class="bas indent1"><span class="nm">(b)</span>Beis Hillel say, she can do so even after Nisu'in.</p>
<p class="bas indent1"><span class="nm">(c)</span>Beis Shamai say, Mi'un can be done to the husband, but not (after she fell) to a Yavam;</p>
<p class="bas indent1"><span class="nm">(d)</span>Beis Hillel say, she can do Mi'un even to a Yavam;</p>
<p class="bas indent1"><span class="nm">(e)</span>Beis Shamai say, Mi'un can be done only in front of the husband;</p>
<p class="bas indent1"><span class="nm">(f)</span>Beis Hillel say, it need not be in front of him.</p>
<p class="bas indent1"><span class="nm">(g)</span>Beis Shamai say, Mi'un can be done only in Beis Din;</p>
<p class="bas indent1"><span class="nm">(h)</span>Beis Hillel say, it need not be in Beis Din.</p>
<p class="bas indent1"><span class="nm">(i)</span><span class="cl">Beis Hillel:</span> A girl may do Mi'un four or five times.</p>
<p class="bas indent1"><span class="nm">(j)</span><span class="cl">Beis Shamai:</span> Benos Yisrael are not Hefker! Rather, she does Mi'un, waits until she grows up, does Mi'un, and gets married [to someone else].</p>
<p class="bas subject"><span class="nm">2)</span>MI'UN FROM NISU'IN</p>
<p class="bas indent1"><span class="nm">(a)</span><span class="cl">(Gemara) Question:</span> Why do Beis Shamai forbid Mi'un from Nisu'in?</p>
<p class="bas indent1"><span class="nm">(b)</span><span class="cl">Answer #1 (Rav Yehudah):</span> Nisu'in cannot be on condition. If girls do Mi'un from Nisu'in, people will come to say that Nisu'in can be conditional.</p>
<p class="bas indent1"><span class="nm">(c)</span><span class="cl">Question:</span> If so, why don't they allow Mi'un after Chupah without Bi'ah?</p>
<p class="bas indent1"><span class="nm">(d)</span><span class="cl">Answer:</span> Chupah cannot be on condition.</p>
<p class="bas indent1"><span class="nm">(e)</span><span class="cl">Question:</span> If so, why don't they allow Mi'un after her father handed her over to the husband's messengers?</p>
<p class="bas indent1"><span class="nm">(f)</span><span class="cl">Answer:</span> Chachamim did not distinguish (between types of Nisu'in).</p>
<p class="bas indent2"><span class="nm">1.</span>Beis Hillel allow Mi'un from Nisu'in, for people know that Nisu'in of an orphaned minor is only mid'Rabanan.</p>
<p class="bas indent1"><span class="nm">(g)</span><span class="cl">Answer #2 (to Question (a) - Rabah and Rav Yosef):</span> Beis Shamai forbid Mi'un from Nisu'in because a person does not want to have Bi'as Zenus. (Men will not marry orphans if they may do Mi'un and retroactively convert the Bi'os to Bi'as Zenus.)</p>
<p class="bas indent1"><span class="nm">(h)</span><span class="cl">Question:</span> If so, why don't they allow Mi'un after Chupah without Bi'ah?</p>
<p class="bas indent1"><span class="nm">(i)</span><span class="cl">Answer:</span> A man does not want that his Chupah was forbidden (retroactively).</p>
<p class="bas indent1"><span class="nm">(j)</span><span class="cl">Question:</span> If so, why don't they allow Mi'un after her father handed her over to the husband's messengers?</p>
<p class="bas indent1"><span class="nm">(k)</span><span class="cl">Answer:</span> Chachamim did not distinguish (between types of Nisu'in).</p>
<p class="bas indent2"><span class="nm">1.</span>Beis Hillel say, since there is Kidushin and a Kesuvah, people will not consider it to be Bi'as Zenus.</p>
<p class="bas indent1"><span class="nm">(l)</span><span class="cl">Answer #3 (Rav Papa):</span> Beis Shamai and Beis Hillel are both concerned for Peiros (yield of her property);</p>
<p class="bas indent2"><span class="nm">1.</span>Beis Shamai hold, if she could do Mi'un, he would hastily eat the Peiros, since he expects her to leave and take back her property;</p>
<p class="bas indent2"><span class="nm">2.</span>Beis Hillel say, the option to do Mi'un <i>encourages</i> him to improve the property, lest her relatives counsel her to do Mi'un!</p>
<p class="bas indent1"><span class="nm">(m)</span><span class="cl">Answer #4 (Rava):</span> Beis Shamai hold that a person does not want to make a (wedding) party and lose it (if she does Mi'un);</p>
<p class="bas indent2"><span class="nm">1.</span>Beis Hillel hold that they are both happy to acquire the title of being married (even if the marriage will not endure).</p>
<p class="bas subject"><span class="nm">3)</span><i>MI'UN</i> TO THE <i>YAVAM</i></p>
<p class="bas indent1"><span class="nm">(a)</span><span class="cl">(Mishnah - Beis Shamai):</span> She may do Mi'un to her husband (...Beis Hillel permit even to the Yavam).</p>
<p class="bas indent1"><span class="nm">(b)</span><span class="cl">(R. Oshaya):</span> She may do Mi'un to (undo) his Ma'amar (so a Get is not needed), but not to his Zikah (to marry l'Shuk without Chalitzah).</p>
<p class="bas indent1"><span class="nm">(c)</span><span class="cl">Question:</span> What is R. Oshaya's reason?</p>
<p class="bas indent1"><span class="nm">(d)</span><span class="cl">Answer #1 (Rav Chisda):</span> A Ma'amar requires her consent, therefore she can uproot it. Zikah is against her will, so she cannot uproot it.</p>
<p class="bas indent1"><span class="nm">(e)</span><span class="cl">Objection:</span> Yibum is against her will, yet she can uproot it!</p>
<p class="bas bbbline">107b----------------------------------------107b</p>
<p class="bas indent1"><span class="nm">(f)</span><span class="cl">Answer #2:</span> Rather, the Yavam does Ma'amar and Yibum, so she can uproot them. Shamayim put Zikah on her, so she cannot uproot it.</p>
<p class="bas indent1"><span class="nm">(g)</span><span class="cl">(Ula):</span> She can do Mi'un even to his Zikah.</p>
<p class="bas indent2"><span class="nm">1.</span>This is because she uproots the first marriage.</p>
<p class="bas indent1"><span class="nm">(h)</span><span class="cl">Question (Rava - Mishnah):</span> If any Ervah (to the Yavam) could have done Mi'un but did not, the Tzarah does Chalitzah, but not Yibum.</p>
<p class="bas indent2"><span class="nm">1.</span>If Mi'un can uproot Zikah, she should do Mi'un now and the Tzarah can do Yibum!</p>
<p class="bas indent1"><span class="nm">(i)</span><span class="cl">Answer:</span> Tzaras Ervah is different for the following reason:</p>
<p class="bas indent2"><span class="nm">1.</span><span class="cl">(Rami bar Yechezkel):</span> If a girl did Mi'un to her husband, she may marry his father. If she did Mi'un to the Yavam, she is forbidden to his father.</p>
<p class="bas indent2"><span class="nm">2.</span>This is because when she fell to Yibum, she looked like his daughter-in-law.</p>
<p class="bas indent2"><span class="nm">3.</span>Also in the Mishnah, when she fell to Yibum, the Tzarah looked like Tzaras Ervah!</p>
<p class="bas indent1"><span class="nm">(j)</span><span class="cl">(Rav):</span> If she did Mi'un to one brother she is forbidden to all brothers, just like Ba'alas ha'Get (a Yevamah who received a Get);</p>
<p class="bas indent2"><span class="nm">1.</span>Since Ba'alas ha'Get is forbidden to the one who gave the Get, she is forbidden to all the brothers. The same applies when she does Mi'un to a Yavam!</p>
<p class="bas indent1"><span class="nm">(k)</span><span class="cl">(Shmuel):</span> If she did Mi'un to one brother, she is permitted to the others. She is unlike Ba'alas ha'Get;</p>
<p class="bas indent2"><span class="nm">1.</span>The Yavam did an action to Ba'alas ha'Get. Here, she acts on him and says that she does not want him;</p>
<p class="bas indent2"><span class="nm">2.</span>She does not want him, but she desires his brother!</p>
<p class="bas indent1"><span class="nm">(l)</span><span class="cl">(Rav Asi):</span> If she did Mi'un to a brother, she is permitted even to him!</p>
<p class="bas indent1"><span class="nm">(m)</span><span class="cl">Suggestion:</span> Rav Asi holds like R. Oshaya, who says that she cannot do Mi'un to uproot his Zikah.</p>
<p class="bas indent1"><span class="nm">(n)</span><span class="cl">Rejection:</span> No. When there is only one Yavam, she can uproot the Zikah. The case is, there are two Yevamim. Mi'un does not work on half the Zikah.</p>
<p class="bas indent1"><span class="nm">(o)</span><span class="cl">(Ravin):</span>  R. Yochanan taught that if she did Mi'un to one brother, she is permitted to the other brothers. They did not agree to this.</p>
<p class="bas indent1"><span class="nm">(p)</span><span class="cl">Question:</span> Who didn't agree to this?</p>
<p class="bas indent1"><span class="nm">(q)</span><span class="cl">Answer #1 (Abaye):</span> Rav did not agree.</p>
<p class="bas indent1"><span class="nm">(r)</span><span class="cl">Version #1 - Answer #2 (Rava):</span> R. Oshaya did not agree. (R. Yochanan connotes that Mi'un does not uproot Zikah only when there are at least two brothers. R. Oshaya holds that it never uproots Zikah.)</p>
<p class="bas indent1"><span class="nm">(s)</span><span class="cl">Version #2 - Answer #2 (Rava):</span> Rav Asi did not agree. (R. Yochanan connotes that she is permitted only to the other brothers.)</p>
<p class="bas subject"><span class="nm">4)</span><i>MI'UN</i> IN FRONT OF THE HUSBAND OR <i>BEIS</i> <i>DIN</i></p>
<p class="bas indent1"><span class="nm">(a)</span><span class="cl">(Mishnah - Beis Shamai):</span> Mi'un must be in front of the husband ...</p>
<p class="bas indent1"><span class="nm">(b)</span><span class="cl">(Beraisa - Beis Hillel):</span> The wife of Pishon the camel-driver did Mi'un in his absence!</p>
<p class="bas indent2"><span class="nm">1.</span><span class="cl">Beis Shamai:</span> Since he acted unfairly (he squandered her Melug property), Chachamim were unfair to him (and let her do Mi'un in his absence)!</p>
<p class="bas indent1"><span class="nm">(c)</span><span class="cl">Question:</span> Since he ate Peiros of her property, she must have done Nisu'in. Beis Shamai do not allow Mi'un from Nisu'in!</p>
<p class="bas indent1"><span class="nm">(d)</span><span class="cl">Answer:</span> Chachamim were unfair to him in two respects.</p>
<p class="bas indent1"><span class="nm">(e)</span><span class="cl">(Mishnah - Beis Shamai):</span> Mi'un must be in front of Beis Din ...</p>
<p class="bas indent1"><span class="nm">(f)</span><span class="cl">(Mishnah):</span> Chalitzah and Mi'un must be in front of three.</p>
<p class="bas indent1"><span class="nm">(g)</span><span class="cl">Question:</span> Who taught that Mishnah?</p>
<p class="bas indent1"><span class="nm">(h)</span><span class="cl">Answer #1 (Rabah):</span> It is Beis Shamai.</p>
<p class="bas indent1"><span class="nm">(i)</span><span class="cl">Answer #2 (Abaye):</span> It can even be Beis Hillel. Beis Hillel do not require a Beis Din of expert judges, but they require three!</p>
<p class="bas indent2"><span class="nm">1.</span><span class="cl">(Beraisa - Beis Shamai):</span> Mi'un must be in front of Beis Din;</p>
<p class="bas indent2"><span class="nm">2.</span>Beis Hillel say, it need not be in front of Beis Din.</p>
<p class="bas indent2"><span class="nm">3.</span>Both agree that three are needed;</p>
<p class="bas indent2"><span class="nm">4.</span>R. Yosi bar Yehudah and R. Elazar b'Rebbi Shimon say that with two, it is valid.</p>
<p class="bas indent2"><span class="nm">5.</span><span class="cl">(Rav Yosef bar Minyomi):</span> The Halachah follows these two Tana'im.</p>
<p class="bas indent1"><span class="nm">(j)</span><span class="cl">(Mishnah - Beis Shamai):</span> She does Mi'un ... (grows up, does Mi'un and gets married).</p>
<p class="bas indent1"><span class="nm">(k)</span><span class="cl">Question:</span> Why is a second Mi'un needed?</p>
<p class="bas indent1"><span class="nm">(l)</span><span class="cl">Answer #1 (Shmuel):</span> When she grows up, she must say that she affirms her first Mi'un.</p>
<p class="bas indent1"><span class="nm">(m)</span><span class="cl">Answer #2 (Ula):</span> Beis Shamai teach two options (that prevent her from doing Mi'un again):</p>
<p class="bas indent2"><span class="nm">1.</span>She may do Mi'un, grow up and become Mekudeshes;</p>
<p class="bas indent2"><span class="nm">2.</span>She may do Mi'un and immediately have Nisu'in.</p>
<p class="bas indent1"><span class="nm">(n)</span><span class="cl">Question:</span> According to Ula, we understand why it says 'until she grows up, <i>does Mi'un</i>, and gets married';</p>
<p class="bas indent2"><span class="nm">1.</span>However, according to Shmuel, it should say, 'until she grows up, <i>says</i>...'!</p>
<p class="bas indent1"><span class="nm">(o)</span>This is left difficult.</p>
<p class="bas subject"><span class="nm">5)</span>WHICH GIRLS MUST DO <i>MI'UN</i>?</p>
<p class="bas indent1"><span class="nm">(a)</span><span class="cl">(Mishnah):</span> Any girl married by her mother and brothers with her consent must do Mi'un. If she was married against her will, she need not do Mi'un;</p>
<p class="bas indent1"><span class="nm">(b)</span>R. Chanina ben Antigonus says, any girl too immature to guard her Kidushin money need not do Mi'un;</p>
<p class="bas indent1"><span class="nm">(c)</span>R. Eliezer says, the actions of a minor have no effect. She is like one who was enticed (to have Bi'ah);</p>
<p class="bas indent2"><span class="nm">1.</span>If she is a Bas Yisrael married to a Kohen, she does not eat Terumah. If she is a Bas Kohen married to a Yisrael, she may eat Terumah.</p>
<p class="bas indent1"><span class="nm">(d)</span>R. Eliezer ben Yakov says, if the husband is the hindrance (this will be explained), it is as if she is his wife. If he is not the hindrance, it is as if she is not his wife.</p>
<p class="bas indent1"><span class="nm">(e)</span><span class="cl">(Gemara - Rav Yehudah):</span> At first, the text of a document of Mi'un used to say 'I do not want him, I do not desire him, and I do not want to be married to him';</p>
<p class="bas indent2"><span class="nm">1.</span>Chachamim saw that the text was too long and people might confuse it with a Get. They enacted to write 'On day Ploni, Plonis did Mi'un in front of us.'</p>
