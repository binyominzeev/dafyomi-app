<p class="bas subject"><span class="nm">1)</span>EXPOUNDING A VERSE AS WE READ IT, OR AS IT IS WRITTEN</p>
<p class="bas indent1"><span class="nm">(a)</span><span class="cl">(Rav Yitzchak bar Yosef):</span> The following Tana'im all expound the way we read (pronounce) a verse: Rebbi, R. Yehudah ben Ro'atz, Beis Shamai, R. Shimon and R. Akiva.</p>
<p class="bas indent1"><span class="nm">(b)</span>Rebbi expounds "Yarshi'un" (above);</p>
<p class="bas indent1"><span class="nm">(c)</span>R. Yehudah ben Ro'atz expounds this way in a Beraisa.</p>
<p class="bas indent2"><span class="nm">1.</span><span class="cl">(Beraisa) Question:</span> When the Torah says that a woman who gave birth to a girl is Tamei "Shevu'ayim" (two weeks), the word lacks a 'Vav', should we read 'Shiv'im' (70 days)?</p>
<p class="bas indent2"><span class="nm">2.</span><span class="cl">Answer (R. Yehudah ben Ro'atz):</span> (A woman who gave birth to a boy is Tamei for seven days, followed by 33 days of Taharah.) Just like the days of Taharah for giving birth to a girl are (66,) twice that for a boy, likewise the days of Tum'ah are twice as many.</p>
<p class="bas indent3"><span class="nm">i.</span>After the Talmidim left, R. Yehudah ran after them and said 'we need not learn from a woman who gave birth to a boy. We expound like we read it, i.e. "Shevu'ayim."'</p>
<p class="bas indent1"><span class="nm">(d)</span>Beis Shamai expound this way in a Mishnah.</p>
<p class="bas indent2"><span class="nm">1.</span><span class="cl">(Mishnah - Beis Shamai):</span> Any Korban whose blood is thrown on the outer Altar, if it was thrown once, it atoned, except for a Chatas, for which two sprinklings are needed;</p>
<p class="bas indent2"><span class="nm">2.</span>Beis Hillel say, even for a Chatas, one sprinkling suffices.</p>
<p class="bas indent2"><span class="nm">3.</span><span class="cl">(Rav Huna):</span> Beis Shamai learn from the three times it says "Keranos" (plural), teaching six. We use four to teach l'Chatchilah, and two to teach what is Me'akev (necessary for atonement).</p>
<p class="bas indent2"><span class="nm">4.</span>Two of the occurrences of 'Keranos' are written missing the 'Vav' (as if it says 'Karnas', singular).  Beis Hillel learn only one from each of those, and two from "Keranos" written with a 'Vav', making four in all;</p>
<p class="bas indent3"><span class="nm">i.</span>They use one to teach what is Me'akev, and three to teach l'Chatchilah (to sprinkle on three additional corners).</p>
<p class="bas indent3"><span class="nm">ii.</span><span class="cl">Question:</span> Why not use all four to teach l'Chatchilah?</p>
<p class="bas indent3"><span class="nm">iii.</span><span class="cl">Answer:</span> We never find atonement without any sprinkling.</p>
<p class="bas indent1"><span class="nm">(e)</span>R. Shimon expounds this way in a Beraisa.</p>
<p class="bas indent2"><span class="nm">1.</span><span class="cl">(Beraisa):</span> Two walls of a Sukah must be the full required length (seven Tefachim). One wall may be (just over) a Tefach (if placed within three Tefachim of a wall);</p>
<p class="bas indent2"><span class="nm">2.</span>R. Shimon says, three walls must be the full length. One wall may be (just over) a Tefach.</p>
<p class="bas indent2"><span class="nm">3.</span><span class="cl">Question:</span> What do they argue about?</p>
<p class="bas indent2"><span class="nm">4.</span><span class="cl">Answer:</span> Chachamim expound the way a verse is written, and R. Shimon expounds the way we read it.</p>
<p class="bas indent2"><span class="nm">5.</span>Two occurrences of 'Sukos' are written missing the 'Vav' (as if it says 'Sukas', singular). Chachamim learn only one (wall) from each of those, and two from "Sukos" written with a 'Vav', making four in all. We do not expound the first occurrence, so three remain;</p>
<p class="bas indent3"><span class="nm">i.</span>A tradition from Moshe from Sinai teaches that one of them may be even a Tefach, leaving two full walls;</p>
<p class="bas indent2"><span class="nm">6.</span>R. Shimon learns two walls from each "Sukos", even those written without a 'Vav', six in all. We do not expound the first occurrence, so four remain;</p>
<p class="bas indent3"><span class="nm">i.</span>A tradition from Sinai teaches that one may be a Tefach, leaving three full walls.</p>
<p class="bas indent1"><span class="nm">(f)</span>R. Akiva expounds this way in a Beraisa.</p>
<p class="bas indent2"><span class="nm">1.</span><span class="cl">(Beraisa - R. Akiva) Question:</span> What is the source that a Revi'is of blood from two dead bodies conveys Tum'ah to an Ohel?</p>
<p class="bas indent2"><span class="nm">2.</span><span class="cl">Answer (R. Akiva):</span> "Al Kol <i>Nafshos</i> Mes" alludes to two souls, and (Mes alludes to) one Shi'ur of blood (essential to life);</p>
<p class="bas indent2"><span class="nm">3.</span>Chachamim expound the way it is written, 'Nafshas' (singular).</p>
<p class="bas indent1"><span class="nm">(g)</span><span class="cl">Objection (Rav Acha bar Yakov):</span> Surely, all the Tana'im expound the way we read a verse!</p>
<p class="bas indent2"><span class="nm">1.</span><span class="cl">(Beraisa) Suggestion:</span> Perhaps "ba'<i>Chalev</i> Imo" forbids (Rashi - only; Ran - even) cooking meat in Chelev (intestinal fats)!</p>
<p class="bas bbbline">4b----------------------------------------4b</p>
<p class="bas indent2"><span class="nm">2.</span><span class="cl">Rejection:</span> We learn (only) from the way we read it (milk. No Tana forbids cooking meat in Chelev. All must learn like this Beraisa! Rav Acha bar Yakov now gives a new explanation of the Tana'im who seemed to expound the way a verse is written.)</p>
<p class="bas indent1"><span class="nm">(h)</span>Chachamim (who argue with Rebbi) also expound the way we read (Yarshi'un);</p>
<p class="bas indent2"><span class="nm">1.</span>Rebbi says, this teaches two judges in addition to those mentioned above. Likewise, "ha'Elohim" above also refers to two, making four (we add a fifth to make an odd number of judges);</p>
<p class="bas indent2"><span class="nm">2.</span>Chachamim explain, "Yarshi'un" refers to the two judges learned, once above and once here (the Chachamim are saying that the two judges above are the same as the two below, and therefore we need a total of two).</p>
<p class="bas indent1"><span class="nm">(i)</span>No one argued against R. Yehudah ben Ro'atz;</p>
<p class="bas indent1"><span class="nm">(j)</span>Beis Hillel also expound the way we read a verse;</p>
<p class="bas indent2"><span class="nm">1.</span><span class="cl">(Beraisa):</span> It says "v'Chiper" three times, so we will not learn from a Kal va'Chomer that all sprinklings are Me'akev.</p>
<p class="bas indent2"><span class="nm">2.</span><span class="cl">Question:</span> A Kal va'Chomer teaches that only one is Me'akev!</p>
<p class="bas indent3"><span class="nm">i.</span>The Torah mentions blood (e.g. of Asham and Shelamim) that is thrown on the bottom half of the Altar, and blood (of a Chatas) put on top of the Altar:</p>
<p class="bas indent3"><span class="nm">ii.</span>Just like one throwing of blood below atones, also of blood above.</p>
<p class="bas indent3"><span class="nm">iii.</span><span class="cl">Suggestion:</span> Perhaps we should instead learn from blood (of certain Chata'os of the congregation) brought on the inner Altar;</p>
<p class="bas indent3"><span class="nm">iv.</span>Regarding the inner Altar, if any sprinkling was omitted, there is no atonement. We should say the same about (Chata'os of) the outer Altar!</p>
<p class="bas indent3"><span class="nm">v.</span><span class="cl">Answer:</span> It is better to learn Chata'os of the outer Altar from Korbanos of the outer Altar, and not from those of the inner Altar.</p>
<p class="bas indent3"><span class="nm">vi.</span><span class="cl">Question:</span> Perhaps it is better to learn Chata'os, whose blood (l'Chatchilah) is put on the four corners (of the Altar) from Chata'os whose blood is put on the four corners, and not from other Korbanos, whose blood is not put on the four corners!</p>
<p class="bas indent2"><span class="nm">3.</span><span class="cl">Answer:</span> Since we might have learned from the inner Chata'os, it says "v'Chiper" three times:</p>
<p class="bas indent3"><span class="nm">i.</span>The first teaches that even if one of the four corners was omitted, the Korban atoned. The second teaches (that it atones) even if two were omitted. The third teaches that even if blood was put only on one corner, it atoned.</p>
<p class="bas indent1"><span class="nm">(k)</span>Chachamim (who argue with R. Shimon) also expound the way we read (Sukos);</p>
<p class="bas indent2"><span class="nm">1.</span>They also learn four walls like R. Shimon. They use one of them to teach that we need Sechach (a ceiling). R. Shimon does not need a verse for this.</p>
<p class="bas indent1"><span class="nm">(l)</span>Chachamim (who argue with R. Akiva) also expound the way we read (Nafshos);</p>
<p class="bas indent2"><span class="nm">1.</span>They say that this refers to souls in general. R. Akiva explains, souls from which this blood came.</p>
<p class="bas indent1"><span class="nm">(m)</span><span class="cl">Objection:</span> Not all agree that we expound the way we read a verse!</p>
<p class="bas indent2"><span class="nm">1.</span><span class="cl">(Beraisa - R. Yishmael):</span> Two occurrences of 'Totafos' are written missing the 'Vov' (as if it says 'Totafas', singular). We only learn one from each of those, and two from "Totafos" written with a 'Vov', making four in all, teaching that there are four compartments in the head Tefilin;</p>
<p class="bas indent2"><span class="nm">2.</span>R. Akiva says, we need not expound that way. In Katfi (a place) 'Tat' means two, and in Afriki, "Fos' means two.</p>
<p class="bas subject"><span class="nm">2)</span>HOW TO ANSWER THE QUESTION FROM <i>CHALAV</i></p>
<p class="bas indent1"><span class="nm">(a)</span><span class="cl">Answer #1 (to Rav Acha's Objection 2:a):</span> Tana'im argue about whether we expound the way we read or the way we write a verse only when it is not read like it is written;</p>
<p class="bas indent2"><span class="nm">1.</span>Chalav and Chelev are both written the same way, therefore all expound the way we read it.</p>
<p class="bas indent1"><span class="nm">(b)</span><span class="cl">Objection:</span> Yir'eh (will see) and Ye'ra'eh (will be seen) are both written the same, and a Tana argues (and expounds both)!</p>
<p class="bas indent2"><span class="nm">1.</span><span class="cl">(Beraisa - Yochanan ben Dehavai):</span> Someone blind in one eye is exempt from entering the Mikdash on the festivals. It says "Ye'ra'eh... Yir'eh" - Hash-m sees those who come, and His Presence is seen by them (Rashi; Tosfos - those who come see His Presence, and they are seen by Him);</p>
<p class="bas indent3"><span class="nm">i.</span>Just like there is no flaw in Hash-m's vision, there us no flaw in the vision of those obligated to come.</p>
<p class="bas indent1"><span class="nm">(c)</span><span class="cl">Answer #2 (to Objection 2:a):</span> "Lo <i>Sevashel</i> Gdi ba'Chalev Imo" - the Torah forbade the way of cooking (i.e. in milk, which is watery. Chelev is fat. One does not cook in it, one fries in it.)</p>
