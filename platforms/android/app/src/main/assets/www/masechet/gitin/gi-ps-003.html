<p class="bas subject"><span class="nm">1)</span>HOW MANY WITNESSES ARE NEEDED</p>
<p class="bas indent1"><span class="nm">(a)</span><span class="cl">Objection:</span> Being lenient (requiring only one witness) will lead to problems!</p>
<p class="bas indent2"><span class="nm">1.</span>If two witnesses were required, the husband could not come later and claim that the Get was not Lishmah. Since only one witness testifies, the husband can come and disqualify the Get!</p>
<p class="bas indent1"><span class="nm">(b)</span><span class="cl">Answer:</span> Since the Get must be given in front of others, the Shali'ach will be disgraced if it is found to be Pasul (invalid, so he will be very careful to see it written Lishmah. Therefore, the husband will not come to disqualify it (and even if he does, he will not be believed).</p>
<p class="bas indent2"><span class="nm">1.</span>R. Yochanan and R. Chanina argued about whether it is given in front of two or three men.</p>
<p class="bas indent1"><span class="nm">(c)</span><span class="cl">Question:</span> Rava says that the concern is that witnesses are not available to be Mekayem the signatures. Why is the Shali'ach believed to be Mekayem the Get? We should require two witnesses, like Kiyum of any document!</p>
<p class="bas indent1"><span class="nm">(d)</span><span class="cl">Answer:</span> One witness is believed about Isurim.</p>
<p class="bas indent1"><span class="nm">(e)</span><span class="cl">Objection:</span> We say so only in cases like a piece of meat that may be Chelev or Shumen, since the piece was never established to be forbidden;</p>
<p class="bas indent2"><span class="nm">1.</span>Here, the Get will permit a woman whom we know was married!</p>
<p class="bas indent2"><span class="nm">2.</span>Also, a Get permits (what was) Ervah. Two witnesses are required for such testimony!</p>
<p class="bas indent1"><span class="nm">(f)</span><span class="cl">Answer:</span> Letter of the law, there is no need for Kiyum at all.</p>
<p class="bas indent2"><span class="nm">1.</span><span class="cl">(Reish Lakish):</span> If a document is signed, it is as if the witnesses testified, and Beis Din accepted their testimony.</p>
<p class="bas indent2"><span class="nm">2.</span>Chachamim were stringent to require Kiyum. They were not so strict to require two witnesses, lest this cause Igun (she would be unable to marry if no one else here recognized the signatures).</p>
<p class="bas indent1"><span class="nm">(g)</span><span class="cl">Objection:</span> Being lenient will lead to problems!</p>
<p class="bas indent2"><span class="nm">1.</span>If we required two witnesses, the husband could not come later and claim that the signatures were forged. Since only one witness testifies, the husband can come and disqualify the Get!</p>
<p class="bas indent1"><span class="nm">(h)</span><span class="cl">Answer:</span> Since the Get must be given in front of others, the Shali'ach will be disgraced if it is found to be Pasul, so he will be very careful to see that it is signed properly. Therefore, the husband will not come to disqualify it.</p>
<p class="bas indent2"><span class="nm">1.</span>R. Yochanan and R. Chanina argued about whether it is given in front of two or three men.</p>
<p class="bas subject"><span class="nm">2)</span>WHY RAVA AND RABAH ARGUE</p>
<p class="bas indent1"><span class="nm">(a)</span><span class="cl">Question:</span> Why doesn't Rava learn like Rabah?</p>
<p class="bas indent1"><span class="nm">(b)</span><span class="cl">Answer (and a question against Rabah):</span> If the concern were Lishmah, the Shali'ach should be required to say 'it was written Lishmah in front of me and signed Lishmah in front of me,'</p>
<p class="bas indent1"><span class="nm">(c)</span><span class="cl">Answer (for Rabah):</span> Letter of the law, we should require him to say this. However, if so, perhaps he will come to omit some of these words (and the Get would be Pasul).</p>
<p class="bas indent1"><span class="nm">(d)</span><span class="cl">Objection:</span> This concern applies also to the text he must say!</p>
<p class="bas indent1"><span class="nm">(e)</span><span class="cl">Answer:</span> The ideal text (in Hebrew, Befanai Nichtav Lishmah, Befanai Nechtam Lishmah) has two clauses of three words each. A Shali'ach might omit one of three words. In the actual text (Befanai Nichtav u'Befanai Nechtam), each clause has two words. One does not omit one of two words.</p>
<p class="bas indent1"><span class="nm">(f)</span><span class="cl">Question:</span> Why doesn't Rabah learn like Rava?</p>
<p class="bas indent1"><span class="nm">(g)</span><span class="cl">Answer (and a question against Rava):</span> If the concern were Kiyum, the Shali'ach should only need to say 'it was signed in front of me.' Why must he also say 'it was written in front of me'?</p>
<p class="bas indent1"><span class="nm">(h)</span><span class="cl">Answer (for Rava):</span> Letter of the law, it should suffice to testify about the signatures. However, if so, people might come to think that in general, one witness suffices for Kiyum. Therefore, we require him to testify also about the writing, to show that this is not regular Kiyum.</p>
<p class="bas indent1"><span class="nm">(i)</span><span class="cl">Objection (on behalf of Rabah):</span> Even without testifying about the writing, it is clear that this is not regular Kiyum!</p>
<p class="bas indent2"><span class="nm">1.</span>In regular Kiyum, the witnesses say 'we recognize (the signatures).' Here, he says '(it was signed) in front of me'!</p>
<p class="bas indent2"><span class="nm">2.</span>A woman cannot be a witness for regular Kiyum. Here, she can!</p>
<p class="bas indent2"><span class="nm">3.</span>An involved party cannot be a witness for regular Kiyum. Here, an involved party can! (A woman can bring her Get and say Befanai Nichtav u'Befanai Nechtam.)</p>
<p class="bas indent1"><span class="nm">(j)</span><span class="cl">Answer (Rava, to the first point):</span> Also here, Sheluchim can be Mekayem the Get by saying 'we recognize (the signatures)', so there is concern lest people think that one witness suffices for regular Kiyum.</p>
<p class="bas subject"><span class="nm">3)</span>WHO IS THE <i>TANA</i> OF THE MISHNAH?</p>
<p class="bas indent1"><span class="nm">(a)</span><span class="cl">Question:</span> Rabah says that the concern is that people are ignorant of the law of Lishmah. The Shali'ach must testify about the writing and signing of the Get. Which Tana requires both of these to be Lishmah?</p>
<p class="bas bbbline">3b----------------------------------------3b</p>
<p class="bas indent2"><span class="nm">1.</span>It is not R. Meir. He requires only signing Lishmah, but not writing Lishmah!</p>
<p class="bas indent3"><span class="nm">i.</span><span class="cl">(Mishnah):</span> A Get may not be written on something attached to the ground. If it was written on something attached, was detached and signed, it is valid. (This shows that only the signatures must be done properly!)</p>
<p class="bas indent2"><span class="nm">2.</span>The Mishnah is unlike R. Elazar. He requires only writing Lishmah, but not signing Lishmah!</p>
<p class="bas indent2"><span class="nm">3.</span><span class="cl">Suggestion:</span> The Mishnah is like R. Elazar. Mid'Oraisa, he does not require signing Lishmah, but mid'Rabanan, he does!</p>
<p class="bas indent2"><span class="nm">4.</span><span class="cl">Rejection:</span> A Mishnah shows that he says that an unsigned Get is valid!</p>
<p class="bas indent2"><span class="nm">5.</span><span class="cl">(Mishnah):</span> There are three Gitin that should not be given. If one was given (and she married someone else), her children are Kosher.</p>
<p class="bas indent3"><span class="nm">i.</span>Her husband wrote the Get himself, and no witnesses signed it;</p>
<p class="bas indent3"><span class="nm">ii.</span>Witnesses signed the Get, but there is no date on it;</p>
<p class="bas indent3"><span class="nm">iii.</span>It has a date, but only one witness signed it.</p>
<p class="bas indent2"><span class="nm">6.</span>R. Elazar says, even if it no witnesses signed, but he gave it to her in front of witnesses, it is valid. Such a document may be used to collect (her Kesuvah; some explain, a loan) from land that (the husband or borrower) sold;</p>
<p class="bas indent3"><span class="nm">i.</span>R. Elazar holds that witnesses sign on a document only due to an enactment, lest the witnesses who saw it given will not be around to testify.</p>
<p class="bas indent1"><span class="nm">(b)</span><span class="cl">Answer #1:</span> Really, the Mishnah is like R. Meir. He does not require the Get to be written Lishmah mid'Oraisa, but requires this mid'Rabanan.</p>
<p class="bas indent1"><span class="nm">(c)</span><span class="cl">Objection:</span> Rav Nachman said that R. Meir holds that if a man finds a Get in the trash (and the names match his and his wife's names), he may tell witnesses to sign it, and then give it to his wife!</p>
