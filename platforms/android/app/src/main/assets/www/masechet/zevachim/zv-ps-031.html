<div class="subject"><span class="nm">1)</span><p>JOINING ONE HALF-<i>ZAYIS</i> TO ANOTHER</p></div>
<div class="indent1"><span class="nm">(a)</span><p><span class="cl">(Rava):</span> If one intended to eat half a k'Zayis tomorrow, half a k'Zayis b'Chutz, and half a k'Zayis tomorrow, the first intent Chutz li'Zmano (which initially was joining with Chutz li'Mkomo to disqualify without Kares) is aroused to join with the latter Chutz li'Zmano to make Pigul with Kares.</p></div>
<div class="indent1"><span class="nm">(b)</span><p><span class="cl">(Rav Hamnuna):</span> These are mixed intents.</p></div>
<div class="indent1"><span class="nm">(c)</span><p><span class="cl">Support (Rava, for himself - Mishnah):</span> If k'Beitzah (an egg's worth) of a food that is a Rishon (first-degree Tum'ah) was mixed with k'Beitzah of a food that is a Sheni (second-degree Tum'ah), the mixture is (Metamei like) a Rishon (it makes a Sheni). If the mixture was split into two parts, each a k'Beitzah, each is a Sheni (makes a Shelishi. Each part has only half a k'Beitzah of a Rishon. Only a k'Beitzah is Metamei);</p></div>
<div class="indent2"><span class="nm">1.</span><p><span class="cl">Inference:</span> If the parts were reunited, the mixture is a Rishon.</p></div>
<div class="indent2"><span class="nm">2.</span><p><span class="cl">Question:</span> What is the source to say this?</p></div>
<div class="indent2"><span class="nm">3.</span><p><span class="cl">Answer (Seifa):</span> If each part fell by itself on a Terumah loaf, it disqualified it (made it a Shelishi). If they fell together (touched it at the same time), they make it a Sheni.</p></div>
<div class="indent1"><span class="nm">(d)</span><p><span class="cl">Version #1 - Rashi - Rejection (Rav Hamnuna):</span> There is different, for there was a complete quantity (from the beginning, therefore it is aroused again. In Rava's case of Pigul, initially there was not a k'Zayis Chutz li'Zmano.)</p></div>
<div class="indent1"><span class="nm">(e)</span><p><span class="cl">Version #2 - R. Tam - Rejection (Rav Hamnuna):</span> There is different, for there is a complete quantity for the Sheni to join with. In Rava's case, since there is not a full k'Zayis Chutz li'Mkomo, it remains combined with Chutz li'Zmano to disqualify. The half k'Zeisim of Chutz li'Zmano do not combine with each other. (end of Version #2)</p></div>
<div class="indent1"><span class="nm">(f)</span><p><span class="cl">Support (Rav Hamnuna, for himself - Mishnah):</span> A Rishon and a Sheni or Shelishi (each less than k'Beitzah) join together to be Metamei like the less Tamei one.</p></div>
<div class="indent2"><span class="nm">1.</span><p><span class="cl">Inference:</span> Even if it joined with more of a Rishon (completing the quantity of a k'Beitzah), it is not a Rishon.</p></div>
<div class="indent1"><span class="nm">(g)</span><p><span class="cl">Rejection:</span> Perhaps the Mishnah discusses only when the quantity was not completed.</p></div>
<div class="indent1"><span class="nm">(h)</span><p><span class="cl">(Rav Dimi citing Bar Kapara):</span> If he intended for half a k'Zayis Chutz li'Mkomo, half a k'Zayis Chutz li'Zmano, and half a k'Zayis Chutz li'Zmano, the half k'Zayis Chutz li'Mkomo does not take effect. The k'Zayis of Chutz li'Zmano makes Pigul.</p></div>
<div class="indent1"><span class="nm">(i)</span><p><span class="cl">(Ravin citing Bar Kapara):</span> If he intended for half a k'Zayis Chutz li'Zmano, half a k'Zayis Chutz li'Zmano, and half a k'Zayis Chutz li'Mkomo, the half k'Zayis Chutz li'Mkomo does not take effect. The k'Zayis of Chutz li'Zmano makes Pigul.</p></div>
<div class="indent1"><span class="nm">(j)</span><p><span class="cl">(Rav Ashi citing Bar Kapara):</span> If he intended for half a k'Zayis Chutz li'Zmano, and a k'Zayis, half is Chutz li'Mkomo, half is Chutz li'Zmano, the half k'Zayis Chutz li'Mkomo does not take effect, the k'Zayis of Chutz li'Zmano makes Pigul.</p></div>
<div class="subject"><span class="nm">2)</span><p>WHAT IS CONSIDERED EATING?</p></div>
<div class="indent1"><span class="nm">(a)</span><p><span class="cl">(R. Yanai):</span> If one intended to feed a k'Zayis to a dog tomorrow, it is Pigul - "v'Es Izevel Yochlu ha'Kelavim."</p></div>
<div class="indent1"><span class="nm">(b)</span><p><span class="cl">Objection (R. Ami):</span> If so, if one intended to burn a k'Zayis, it should be Pigul - "Te'achlehu Esh"!</p></div>
<div class="indent2"><span class="nm">1.</span><p><span class="cl">Suggestion:</span> Perhaps that is true!</p></div>
<div class="indent2"><span class="nm">2.</span><p><span class="cl">Rejection (Mishnah):</span> (If he intended) to eat half a k'Zayis (Chutz li'Mkomo or Chutz li'Zmano) and Lehaktir half a k'Zayis, it is Kosher, because eating and burning do not join.</p></div>
<div class="indent1"><span class="nm">(c)</span><p><span class="cl">Answer:</span> If he said that the fire will be 'Ochel' (eat), it joins with human eating!</p></div>
<div class="indent2"><span class="nm">1.</span><p>The Mishnah discusses one who said 'Lehaktir' (to burn).</p></div>
<div class="indent1"><span class="nm">(d)</span><p><span class="cl">Question (Rav Asi):</span> If he intended to feed a k'Zayis to two people (Chutz), what is the law?</p></div>
<div class="indent2"><span class="nm">1.</span><p>If intent for a k'Zayis is the criterion, he did so;</p></div>
<div class="indent2"><span class="nm">2.</span><p>If he must intend for one to eat a k'Zayis, he did not.</p></div>
<div class="indent1"><span class="nm">(e)</span><p><span class="cl">Answer (Abaye - Mishnah):</span> If he intended to eat half a k'Zayis and Lehaktir half a k'Zayis, it is Kosher, because eating and burning do not join.</p></div>
<div class="bbbline">31b----------------------------------------31b</p></div>
<div class="indent2"><span class="nm">1.</span><p><span class="cl">Inference:</span> In a similar case of eating and eating, i.e. two different people, they would join!</p></div>
<div class="indent1"><span class="nm">(f)</span><p><span class="cl">Question (Rava):</span> If one intended to eat a k'Zayis (Chutz) over a period of time more than is needed to eat a half loaf, what is the law?</p></div>
<div class="indent2"><span class="nm">1.</span><p>Do we learn from consumption of the Mizbe'ach (which is also slow), or of people (this is not considered eating regarding other Mitzvos)?</p></div>
<div class="indent1"><span class="nm">(g)</span><p><span class="cl">Answer (Abaye - Seifa):</span> To eat half a k'Zayis and Lehaktir half a k'Zayis, it is Kosher, because eating and burning do not join.</p></div>
<div class="indent2"><span class="nm">1.</span><p><span class="cl">Inference:</span> In a similar case of eating and eating, they would join;</p></div>
<div class="indent2"><span class="nm">2.</span><p>Haktarah of a k'Zayis takes more than the time to eat a half loaf. A similar case of eating joins to make Pigul!</p></div>
<div class="indent1"><span class="nm">(h)</span><p><span class="cl">Rejection:</span> Perhaps the Seifa discusses a big fire on the Mizbe'ach (a k'Zayis burns in less than the time to eat a half loaf).</p></div>
<div class="indent1"><span class="nm">(i)</span><p><span class="cl">Inference:</span> The Seifa says that eating and burning do not join. If the same things burned would be eaten instead, they would join, even though what is proper for the Mizbe'ach is not proper for people!</p></div>
<div class="indent1"><span class="nm">(j)</span><p><span class="cl">Contradiction (Reisha):</span> Intent to eat something normally eaten (makes Pigul).</p></div>
<div class="indent2"><span class="nm">1.</span><p><span class="cl">Inference:</span> Things not normally eaten do not join for Pigul!</p></div>
<div class="indent1"><span class="nm">(k)</span><p><span class="cl">Answer #1 (R. Yirmeyah):</span> The Seifa is R. Eliezer, who says that intent for one (or the Mizbe'ach) to 'eat' something fit for the Mizbe'ach (or people) is intent.</p></div>
<div class="indent2"><span class="nm">1.</span><p><span class="cl">(Mishnah):</span> If one slaughtered a Korban with intent to eat (or burn) (Chutz li'Zmano or Chutz li'Mkomo) something that is not normally eaten (or burned), it is Kosher;</p></div>
<div class="indent2"><span class="nm">2.</span><p>R. Eliezer says, it is Pasul.</p></div>
<div class="indent1"><span class="nm">(l)</span><p><span class="cl">Answer #2 (Abaye):</span> The Seifa can be Chachamim;</p></div>
<div class="indent2"><span class="nm">1.</span><p>Do not infer that eating something not normally eaten joins for Pigul. Rather, eating something normally eaten joins.</p></div>
<div class="indent1"><span class="nm">(m)</span><p><span class="cl">Question:</span> What is the Chidush?</p></div>
<div class="indent2"><span class="nm">1.</span><p>It cannot teach that half a k'Zayis Chutz li'Mkomo and half a k'Zayis Chutz li'Zmano join to disqualify. A previous clause of Mishnah teaches this explicitly!</p></div>
<div class="indent2"><span class="nm">2.</span><p>It cannot teach that intent to eat half a k'Zayis and Lehaktir half a k'Zayis join. We infer otherwise from the Reisha!</p></div>
<div class="indent3"><span class="nm">i.</span><p><span class="cl">(Reisha):</span> Intent to eat something normally eaten (makes Pigul).</p></div>
<div class="indent3"><span class="nm">ii.</span><p><span class="cl">Inference:</span> Something not normally eaten does not join for Pigul.</p></div>
<div class="indent2"><span class="nm">3.</span><p>If intent to eat half a k'Zayis (of meat) and to eat half a k'Zayis of Eimurim (which are not normally eaten) do not join, all the more so intents to eat and burn them do not join!</p></div>
<div class="indent1"><span class="nm">(n)</span><p><span class="cl">Answer:</span> No. Intents to eat both do not join because eating Eimurim is abnormal, but intent to eat half a k'Zayis of meat could join intent to burn half a k'Zayis of Eimurim, since both of these are normal;</p></div>
<div class="indent2"><span class="nm">1.</span><p>Therefore, the Mishnah must teach that they do not join.</p></div>
<div class="perekline"><p>PEREK KOL HA'PESULIM</p></div>
<div class="subject"><span class="nm">3)</span><p>IF <i>PESULIM</i> SLAUGHTERED</p></div>
<div class="indent1"><span class="nm">(a)</span><p><span class="cl">(Mishnah):</span> If any of the following Pesulim (i.e. for other Avodos) slaughtered, it is Kosher, even for Kodshei Kodoshim - a Zar, woman, slave, or Tamei (person).</p></div>
<div class="indent2"><span class="nm">1.</span><p>The Tamei must be careful not to touch the meat.</p></div>
<div class="indent1"><span class="nm">(b)</span><p>Because the Shechitah is valid, if a Pasul slaughtered with improper intent (Chutz li'Zmano or Chutz li'Mkomo), this disqualifies the Korban.</p></div>
