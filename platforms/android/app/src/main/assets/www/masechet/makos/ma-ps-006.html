<p class="bas subject"><span class="nm">1)</span>ONE WITNESS FOUND TO BE A RELATIVE OR PASUL</p>
<p class="bas indent1"><span class="nm">(a)</span>R. Yosi says, this applies only to capital cases. In monetary cases, the testimony of the Kosher witnesses is valid. (Rashi - due to "v'Hitzilu ha'Edah", we seek reasons to acquit in capital cases. Tosfos - in capital cases, if one of the two witnesses is Karov or Pasul, the remaining witness is worthless, but in monetary cases, the remaining witness obligates an oath.)</p>
<p class="bas indent1"><span class="nm">(b)</span>Rebbi says, this applies both to capital and monetary cases;</p>
<p class="bas indent2"><span class="nm">1.</span>This is only if the witnesses warned the transgressor (i.e. they intended to be witnesses). If you will not say so, if two brothers see a murder (even with other witnesses), Beis Din will be unable to kill the murderer (because one of the witnesses is related to another)!</p>
<p class="bas indent1"><span class="nm">(c)</span><span class="cl">(Gemara - Rava):</span> (They are considered one Kat of witnesses) only if they all testified Toch Kedei Dibur.</p>
<p class="bas indent1"><span class="nm">(d)</span><span class="cl">Question (Rav Acha mi'Difti):</span> Toch Kedei Dibur is the time needed for a Talmid to greet his Rebbi (to say three or four words, Shalom Alecha Rebbi (u'Mori)). A hundred witnesses cannot testify within this time!</p>
<p class="bas indent1"><span class="nm">(e)</span><span class="cl">Answer (Ravina):</span> It suffices if each begins within Toch Kedei Dibur of the previous one.</p>
<p class="bas indent1"><span class="nm">(f)</span><span class="cl">(Mishnah - R. Akiva):</span> (... Also if one of three witnesses was found to be a relative or Pasul, the testimony is invalid.)</p>
<p class="bas indent1"><span class="nm">(g)</span><span class="cl">Question (Rav Papa):</span> A murder victim was an invalid witness. We should say that he disqualifies all the witnesses!</p>
<p class="bas indent1"><span class="nm">(h)</span><span class="cl">Answer #1 (Abaye):</span> Yes! According to R. Akiva, the testimony is valid only if he was killed from the back (and did not see the murder).</p>
<p class="bas indent1"><span class="nm">(i)</span><span class="cl">Question (Rav Papa):</span> A Nirva (the 'receiving' party in homosexual relatiions) is an invalid witness. He should disqualify the witnesses!</p>
<p class="bas indent1"><span class="nm">(j)</span><span class="cl">Answer #1 (Abaye):</span> The testimony is valid only if he was facing away (and did not see the Shochev (the man who had Bi'ah with him)).</p>
<p class="bas indent1"><span class="nm">(k)</span><span class="cl">Question (Rav Papa):</span> The murderer or the Shochev should disqualify the witnesses!</p>
<p class="bas indent1"><span class="nm">(l)</span>Abaye was silent.</p>
<p class="bas indent1"><span class="nm">(m)</span><span class="cl">Answer (and Answer #2 to the previous questions - Rava):</span> "Yakum Davar" - witnesses are those who establish (the truth of) a matter, and not the parties that do the matter. (The parties are not considered witnesses at all.)</p>
<p class="bas subject"><span class="nm">2)</span>WHEN DO PESULIM INVALIDATE THE TESTIMONY?</p>
<p class="bas indent1"><span class="nm">(a)</span><span class="cl">(Mishnah - R. Yosi):</span> This applies only... (Rebbi says, this is only if they warned the transgressor... )</p>
<p class="bas indent1"><span class="nm">(b)</span><span class="cl">Version #1 - Rashi - Question:</span> What do we ask the invalid witnesses ((Tosfos - in monetary cases) to determine whether or not they intended to be witnesses)?</p>
<p class="bas indent1"><span class="nm">(c)</span><span class="cl">Answer (Rava):</span> We ask them if they came to the scene of the incident just to see, or in order to testify about it later (Tosfos, R. Chananel; Ritva - we ask them whether they came to Beis Din to testify, or just to see what the outcome will be).</p>
<p class="bas indent1"><span class="nm">(d)</span><span class="cl">Version #2 - R. Chaim Kohen - Question:</span> What do we ask the valid witnesses?</p>
<p class="bas indent1"><span class="nm">(e)</span><span class="cl">Answer (Rava):</span> We ask them if they came to Beis Din intending to testify with the invalid witnesses.</p>
<p class="bas indent1"><span class="nm">(f)</span><span class="cl">(Rav Yehudah):</span> The Halachah follows R. Yosi.</p>
<p class="bas indent1"><span class="nm">(g)</span><span class="cl">(Rav Nachman):</span> The Halachah follows Rebbi.</p>
<p class="bas bbbline">6b----------------------------------------6b</p>
<p class="bas subject"><span class="nm">3)</span>EDUS MEYUCHEDES</p>
<p class="bas indent1"><span class="nm">(a)</span><span class="cl">(Mishnah):</span> If two witnesses saw the murderer from a window, and two witnesses saw from a different window, and someone in the middle warned him:</p>
<p class="bas indent2"><span class="nm">1.</span>If at least one witness in each pair saw one of the other pair, they are considered one Kat. If not, they are two Kitos.</p>
<p class="bas indent2"><span class="nm">2.</span>Therefore (when they are two Kitos), if one Kat was Huzam, they and the murderer are killed, and the other Kat is exempt.</p>
<p class="bas indent1"><span class="nm">(b)</span>R. Yosi says, if both witnesses did not warn him, (he is exempt, therefore also) the witnesses are not killed - "Al <i>Pi</i> Shnayim Edim."</p>
<p class="bas indent2"><span class="nm">1.</span>This also teaches that Sanhedrin must hear the testimony of the witnesses themselves, and not through a translator.</p>
<p class="bas indent1"><span class="nm">(c)</span><span class="cl">(Gemara - Rav Zutra bar Tuvya) Question:</span> What is the source that Edus Meyuchedes (when the witnesses did not see each other) is invalid?</p>
<p class="bas indent1"><span class="nm">(d)</span><span class="cl">Answer:</span> "Lo Yumas Al Pi Ed Echad";</p>
<p class="bas indent2"><span class="nm">1.</span><span class="cl">Question:</span> What does 'Echad' mean?</p>
<p class="bas indent3"><span class="nm">i.</span><span class="cl">Suggestion:</span> There is only one witness.</p>
<p class="bas indent3"><span class="nm">ii.</span><span class="cl">Rejection:</span> We already know this from "Al Pi Shnayim Edim"!</p>
<p class="bas indent2"><span class="nm">2.</span><span class="cl">Answer:</span> It means that the witnesses are one by one, i.e. they did not see each other.</p>
<p class="bas indent1"><span class="nm">(e)</span><span class="cl">Support (Beraisa):</span> "Lo Yumas Al Pi Ed Echad" teaches that if one witness saw from a window, and another witness saw from a different window, they do not join;</p>
<p class="bas indent2"><span class="nm">1.</span>Even if they saw from the same window, one after the other, they do not join.</p>
<p class="bas indent1"><span class="nm">(f)</span><span class="cl">Question (Rav Papa):</span> The Tana taught that when they see from different windows, each saw the entire incident, yet they do not join. If they saw from the same window, each saw only part of the incident. All the more so they do not join! (What is the Chidush of the Seifa?)</p>
<p class="bas indent1"><span class="nm">(g)</span><span class="cl">Answer (Abaye):</span> The Chidush is regarding Arayos, for each saw a full act that is Chayav Misah.</p>
<p class="bas indent1"><span class="nm">(h)</span><span class="cl">(Rava):</span> If the witnesses saw the Masreh (the one who gave warning), or if the Masreh saw them, the witnesses join. (Tosfos - in the latter case, we must know through (other) witnesses that the Masreh saw them.)</p>
<p class="bas indent1"><span class="nm">(i)</span><span class="cl">(Rava):</span> The warning can be even by himself (Rashi - the victim warned him; Kesef Mishnah - the transgressor said 'I know that Beis Din will kill me for this') or by a Shed.</p>
<p class="bas indent1"><span class="nm">(j)</span><span class="cl">(Rav Nachman):</span> "Lo <i>Yumas</i> Al Pi Ed Echad" - Edus Meyuchedes is invalid for capital cases, but it is valid for monetary cases.</p>
<p class="bas indent1"><span class="nm">(k)</span><span class="cl">Question (Rav Zutra):</span> (We rely on any possible reason to avoid killing a transgressor.) If Edus Meyuchedes is valid in some case, we should validate it in capital cases when it will save the transgressor! (If we consider all the witnesses to be one Kat, if even one is Huzam, all the testimony is invalid!) Why does the Mishnah say that we kill the transgressor and the lying witnesses?</p>
<p class="bas indent1"><span class="nm">(l)</span>This is left difficult.</p>
<p class="bas subject"><span class="nm">4)</span>AL PI SHNAYIM EDIM</p>
<p class="bas indent1"><span class="nm">(a)</span><span class="cl">(Mishnah - R. Yosi):</span> If both witnesses did not warn him (no one is killed).</p>
<p class="bas indent1"><span class="nm">(b)</span><span class="cl">Question (Rav Papa):</span> R. Yosi does not require warning of two witnesses!</p>
<p class="bas indent2"><span class="nm">1.</span><span class="cl">(Mishnah):</span> If Reuven hated Ploni and he (seemingly accidentally) killed Ploni, he is killed, for surely he was Mezid!</p>
<p class="bas indent1"><span class="nm">(c)</span><span class="cl">Answer (Abaye):</span> The Tana of that Mishnah is really R. Yosi bar Yehudah.</p>
<p class="bas indent2"><span class="nm">1.</span><span class="cl">(Beraisa - R. Yosi b'Rebbi Yehudah):</span> A Chaver need not be warned, for warning is only to distinguish whether one is Shogeg or Mezid.</p>
<p class="bas indent1"><span class="nm">(d)</span><span class="cl">(Mishnah):</span> This also teaches that the Sanhedrin may not hear the testimony of the witnesses through a translator.</p>
<p class="bas indent1"><span class="nm">(e)</span>Witnesses (Rambam - two parties) came in front of Rava. They did not speak a language that the judges knew; so he put a translator between them.</p>
<p class="bas indent1"><span class="nm">(f)</span><span class="cl">Question:</span> The Mishnah forbids this!</p>
<p class="bas indent1"><span class="nm">(g)</span><span class="cl">Answer:</span> Rava could understand what they said. He needed the translator only to speak to them.</p>
