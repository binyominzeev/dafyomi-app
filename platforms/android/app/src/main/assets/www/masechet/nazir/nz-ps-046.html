<p class="bas subject"><span class="nm">1)</span>WHEN ARE THE <i>ISURIM</i> PERMITTED?</p>
<p class="bas indent1"><span class="nm">(a)</span><span class="cl">(Mishnah):</span> He cooks or overcooks the Shelamim. The Kohen takes the cooked foreleg of the ram, a Matzah loaf from the basket, and a wafer, and puts them on the hand of the Nazir and waves them. Afterwards, the Nazir may drink wine and be Metamei;</p>
<p class="bas indent1"><span class="nm">(b)</span>R. Shimon says, after Zerikah (throwing the blood on the Mizbe'ach) of one of the Korbanos, he may drink and be Metamei.</p>
<p class="bas indent1"><span class="nm">(c)</span><span class="cl">(Gemara - Beraisa - R. Eliezer):</span> "V'Achar Yishteh ha'Nazir Yayin" - after all the actions;</p>
<p class="bas indent1"><span class="nm">(d)</span>Chachamim say, after a single action.</p>
<p class="bas indent1"><span class="nm">(e)</span><span class="cl">Question:</span> What is Chachamim's source?</p>
<p class="bas indent1"><span class="nm">(f)</span><span class="cl">Answer:</span> It says "V'Achar Yishteh ha'Nazir Yayin" and it says "V'Achar Hisgalcho Es Nizro";</p>
<p class="bas indent2"><span class="nm">1.</span>Just like there it is after one action, also here.</p>
<p class="bas indent1"><span class="nm">(g)</span><span class="cl">Suggestion:</span> Perhaps there it means after both (shaving and Korbanos)!</p>
<p class="bas indent1"><span class="nm">(h)</span><span class="cl">Rejection:</span> If so, the Gezeirah Shavah "Achar-Achar" would not teach anything.</p>
<p class="bas subject"><span class="nm">2)</span>ESSENTIAL PARTS OF <i>GILU'ACH</i></p>
<p class="bas indent1"><span class="nm">(a)</span><span class="cl">Version #1 (Rav):</span> The Nazir must wave (the foreleg and breads to become permitted to drink and be Metamei).</p>
<p class="bas indent1"><span class="nm">(b)</span><span class="cl">Question:</span> According to whom is Rav's law?</p>
<p class="bas indent2"><span class="nm">1.</span>It is unlike Chachamim. They permit him even without shaving, all the more so without waving!</p>
<p class="bas indent1"><span class="nm">(c)</span><span class="cl">Answer:</span> Rather, it is according to R. Eliezer.</p>
<p class="bas indent1"><span class="nm">(d)</span><span class="cl">Objection:</span> This is obvious. R. Eliezer permits after all the actions!</p>
<p class="bas indent1"><span class="nm">(e)</span><span class="cl">Answer:</span> One might have thought that since one gets atonement without waving, likewise one is permitted without waving. Rav teaches that this is not so.</p>
<p class="bas bbbline">46b----------------------------------------46b</p>
<p class="bas indent1"><span class="nm">(f)</span><span class="cl">Question:</span> Waving is not essential to become permitted!</p>
<p class="bas indent2"><span class="nm">1.</span><span class="cl">(Beraisa #1):</span> "This is the law of the Nazir" - whether or not he has hands. (We are thinking that just like a handless Nazir need not wave, also one with hands.)</p>
<p class="bas indent1"><span class="nm">(g)</span><span class="cl">Answer:</span> You cannot say so, for if so, you should say the same about shaving (that one with hair is like one without hair. But if so, Beraisa #2 is not like either opinion in Beraisa #3!)</p>
<p class="bas indent2"><span class="nm">1.</span><span class="cl">(Beraisa #2):</span> "This is the law of the Nazir" - whether or not he has hair.</p>
<p class="bas indent2"><span class="nm">2.</span><span class="cl">(Beraisa #3 - Beis Shamai):</span> If a Nazir's hair fell out, he need not pass a Ta'ar over his head;</p>
<p class="bas indent2"><span class="nm">3.</span>Beis Hillel say that he must.</p>
<p class="bas indent3"><span class="nm">i.</span><span class="cl">(Ravina):</span> Beis Shamai say that he need not, i.e. he must shave, but he cannot.</p>
<p class="bas indent3"><span class="nm">ii.</span><span class="cl">Inference:</span> According to Beis Hillel, he shaves and becomes permitted!</p>
<p class="bas indent2"><span class="nm">4.</span>(</span><span class="cl">Summation of answer:</span> Beraisa #2 cannot be Beis Shamai, who distinguish one with hair from one without hair. It cannot be like Beis Hillel and teach that a Nazir with hair must shave, for other verses explicit say so! Rather, we must say that Beraisa #2 equates one without hair to one with hair. It is like Beis Hillel, and obligates a bald Nazir to pass a Ta'ar over his head. Likewise, Beraisa #1 equates one without hands to one with hands. It is like Beis Hillel, and obligates a Nazir without hands to wave on the end of his arms, akin to one with hands.)</p>
<p class="bas indent1"><span class="nm">(h)</span>Ravina holds like R. Pedas:</p>
<p class="bas indent2"><span class="nm">1.</span><span class="cl">(R. Pedas):</span> Beis Shamai and R. Eliezer taught similar laws:</p>
<p class="bas indent3"><span class="nm">i.</span><span class="cl">(Beraisa - R. Eliezer):</span> A Metzora lacking a right thumb or big toe can never become Tahor;</p>
<p class="bas indent3"><span class="nm">ii.</span>R. Shimon says, it suffices to put (the blood and oil) on the place where the thumb or toe should be;</p>
<p class="bas indent3"><span class="nm">iii.</span>Chachamim say, it suffices to put them on the left thumb or toe.</p>
<p class="bas indent1"><span class="nm">(i)</span><span class="cl">Version #2 (Rav):</span> The Nazir must wave (to become permitted).</p>
<p class="bas indent1"><span class="nm">(j)</span><span class="cl">Question:</span> According to whom is Rav's law?</p>
<p class="bas indent2"><span class="nm">1.</span>It cannot be according to R. Eliezer, for this would be obvious. R. Eliezer permits after all the actions!</p>
<p class="bas indent1"><span class="nm">(k)</span><span class="cl">Answer:</span> Rather, it is according to Chachamim.</p>
<p class="bas indent1"><span class="nm">(l)</span><span class="cl">Objection:</span> Chachamim permit even without shaving, all the more so, without waving!</p>
<p class="bas indent1"><span class="nm">(m)</span><span class="cl">Answer:</span> Waving is essential to become permitted!</p>
<p class="bas indent2"><span class="nm">1.</span><span class="cl">(Beraisa #1):</span> "This is the law of the Nazir" - whether or not he has hands. (We are thinking that just like waving is Me'akev a handless Nazir (because he could not wave), it is Me'akev also a Nazir with hands.)</p>
<p class="bas indent1"><span class="nm">(n)</span><span class="cl">Question:</span> If so, we should likewise understand the following to say that a bald Nazir cannot become permitted! (But if so, Beraisa #2 is not like either opinion in Beraisa #3!)</p>
<p class="bas indent2"><span class="nm">1.</span><span class="cl">(Beraisa #2):</span> "This is the law of the Nazir" - whether or not he has hair.</p>
<p class="bas indent2"><span class="nm">2.</span><span class="cl">(Beraisa #3 - Beis Shamai):</span> If a Nazir's hair fell out, he need not pass a Ta'ar over his head;</p>
<p class="bas indent2"><span class="nm">3.</span>Beis Hillel say that he must.</p>
<p class="bas indent3"><span class="nm">i.</span><span class="cl">(R. Avina):</span> Beis Hillel say that he must, i.e. he must shave, but he cannot. Beis Shamai holds that he has a solution (he can pass a Ta'ar over his head! Tosfos asks, we could say that Beraisa #2 is like Beis Hillel. It teaches that in either case, shaving is Me'akev! He answers that in any case we could ask that Chachamim explicitly say that shaving is not Me'akev, and R. Eliezer learns that it is Me'akev from another since ("after all the actions").)</p>
<p class="bas indent3"><span class="nm">ii.</span>R. Avina disagrees with R. Pedas.</p>
<p class="bas subject"><span class="nm">3)</span>SHAVING AFTER OFFERING AN INVALID <i>KORBAN</i></p>
<p class="bas indent1"><span class="nm">(a)</span><span class="cl">(Mishnah):</span> If a Nazir shaved after offering a Korban, and it was found to be invalid, his shaving is invalid, and he was not Yotzei with his other Korbanos (he must bring them again);</p>
<p class="bas indent1"><span class="nm">(b)</span>If he shaved after the Chatas was offered Lo Lishmah (with important intent, which disqualifies it) and later he brought the other Korbanos Lishmah, his shaving is invalid and he was not Yotzei the other Korbanos;</p>
<p class="bas indent1"><span class="nm">(c)</span>If he shaved after the Olah or Shelamim was offered Lo Lishmah, and he later brought the other Korbanos Lishmah, his shaving is invalid and he was not Yotzei the other Korbanos;</p>
<p class="bas indent1"><span class="nm">(d)</span>R. Shimon says, he was not Yotzei the first Korban, but he was Yotzei the others.</p>
<p class="bas indent1"><span class="nm">(e)</span>If he shaved after all the Korbanos, and one was found to be valid, his shaving is valid, and he must again bring those Korbanos that were invalid.</p>
<p class="bas indent1"><span class="nm">(f)</span><span class="cl">(Gemara - Rav Ada bar Ahavah) Inference:</span> R. Shimon holds that if a Nazir shaved after bringing a voluntary Shelamim, the shaving is valid.</p>
<p class="bas indent2"><span class="nm">1.</span>He learns from "... ha'Shelamim" - it did not say 'his Shelamim.'</p>
