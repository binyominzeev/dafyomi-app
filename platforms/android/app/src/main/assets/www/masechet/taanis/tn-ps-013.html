<p class="bas subject"><span class="nm">1)</span>BATHING RESTRICTIONS ON DIFFERENT DAYS</p>
<p class="bas indent1"><span class="nm">(a)</span><span class="cl">(Rafram bar Papa citing R. Chisda):</span> On any occasion that is due to mourning, such as Tish'ah b'Av and regular mourning, it is forbidden to bathe whether in hot or cold water.</p>
<p class="bas indent1"><span class="nm">(b)</span>On any occasion that is due to refraining from pleasure, such as a Ta'anis Tzibur, it is forbidden to bathe in hot water but permitted in cold.</p>
<p class="bas indent2"><span class="nm">1.</span><span class="cl">(R. Idi bar Avin):</span> This is also evident from our Mishnah, which states that on a Ta'anis Tzibur, they would lock the (hot) bathhouses.</p>
<p class="bas indent2"><span class="nm">2.</span><span class="cl">(Abaye):</span> This is no proof - if even cold water were forbidden, it could not have said that we lock the rivers!</p>
<p class="bas indent2"><span class="nm">3.</span><span class="cl">(R. Shisha b. R. Idi):</span> The intent is that since it already said that bathing is forbidden, it wouldn't have to say that the bathhouses are locked unless it was to point out that only hot water is forbidden.</p>
<p class="bas indent1"><span class="nm">(c)</span><span class="cl">Support:</span> A proof for R. Chisda is suggested from a Beraisa:</p>
<p class="bas indent2"><span class="nm">1.</span>Those who are obligated in Tevilah can do so as normal even on Tish'ah b'Av and Yom Kipur.</p>
<p class="bas indent2"><span class="nm">2.</span>This cannot be referring to warm water, as warm water is drawn and invalid for Tevilah.</p>
<p class="bas indent2"><span class="nm">3.</span>It must therefore be referring to cold water, and we see that only such people may bathe in it, but not others!</p>
<p class="bas indent1"><span class="nm">(d)</span><span class="cl">Dismissal (R. Chana bar Katina):</span> It is no proof; it may be referring to the hot springs of Tiveriya.</p>
<p class="bas indent1"><span class="nm">(e)</span><span class="cl">Support:</span> In the latter part of the Beraisa, it is noted that the loss of the Beis ha'Mikdash justifies losing one bathing a year - we see that even cold water is forbidden!</p>
<p class="bas indent1"><span class="nm">(f)</span><span class="cl">Dismissal (R. Papa):</span> It refers to a location where cold water is not to be found.</p>
<p class="bas indent1"><span class="nm">(g)</span><span class="cl">Contradiction:</span> A contradiction to R. Chisda is suggested from another Beraisa:</p>
<p class="bas indent2"><span class="nm">1.</span>The Beraisa states:</p>
<p class="bas indent3"><span class="nm">i.</span>The prohibition of Melachah on a Ta'anis Tzibur only applies by day.</p>
<p class="bas indent3"><span class="nm">ii.</span>The prohibition of wearing leather shoes only applies within a city.</p>
<p class="bas indent3"><span class="nm">iii.</span>The prohibition of washing only applies to the whole body, but not to the face, hands and feet.</p>
<p class="bas indent3"><span class="nm">iv.</span>The same applies to an excommunicated person and to a mourner.</p>
<p class="bas indent2"><span class="nm">2.</span>The latter clause presumably applies to all the aforementioned laws.</p>
<p class="bas indent2"><span class="nm">3.</span>It cannot be referring to warm water, as a mourner may not wash any part of his body with warm water.</p>
<p class="bas indent2"><span class="nm">4.</span>So it must be referring to cold water, and we see that on a Ta'anis Tzibur it is forbidden to bathe in cold water!</p>
<p class="bas indent1"><span class="nm">(h)</span><span class="cl">Resolution:</span> It refers to warm water; it is only the earlier laws that are also being applied to a mourner.</p>
<p class="bas indent1"><span class="nm">(i)</span><span class="cl">Contradiction:</span> Another contradiction to R. Chisda is brought:</p>
<p class="bas indent2"><span class="nm">1.</span>When R. Yosi b. R. Chanina's sons died, he bathed in cold water during the seven days of mourning!?</p>
<p class="bas indent1"><span class="nm">(j)</span><span class="cl">Resolution:</span> In that case, it was allowed because he had consecutive periods of mourning:</p>
<p class="bas indent2"><span class="nm">1.</span><span class="cl">(Beraisa):</span> If a person had consecutive periods of mourning, then if his hair grows overly long, he can cut it with a razor, and he can wash his clothes in water.</p>
<p class="bas indent2"><span class="nm">2.</span><span class="cl">(R. Chisda):</span> He can use a razor but not scissors; he can wash them in water but not with detergents or sand.</p>
<p class="bas subject"><span class="nm">2)</span>WASHING FOR MOURNERS</p>
<p class="bas indent1"><span class="nm">(a)</span><span class="cl">(Rava):</span> A mourner may wash in cold water all seven days - it is no different from eating meat and drinking wine.</p>
<p class="bas bbbline">13b----------------------------------------13b</p>
<p class="bas indent1"><span class="nm">(b)</span><span class="cl">Question:</span> We see otherwise in a Beraisa:</p>
<p class="bas indent2"><span class="nm">1.</span>A Bogeres (adult girl) may not let herself appear ugly while mourning for her father.</p>
<p class="bas indent2"><span class="nm">2.</span>The implication is that a Na'arah (sub-adult girl) may.</p>
<p class="bas indent2"><span class="nm">3.</span>This cannot be referring to hot water, as nobody is allowed to wash in hot water while mourning (not even a Bogeres).</p>
<p class="bas indent2"><span class="nm">4.</span>So it must refer to cold water, and we see that anyone other than a Bogeres is forbidden!?</p>
<p class="bas indent1"><span class="nm">(c)</span><span class="cl">Answer:</span> It is not referring to washing; it is referring to wearing makeup.</p>
<p class="bas indent1"><span class="nm">(d)</span>A proof for Rava is suggested:</p>
<p class="bas indent2"><span class="nm">1.</span>When R. Yosi b. R. Chanina's sons died, he bathed in cold water during the seven days of mourning!?</p>
<p class="bas indent1"><span class="nm">(e)</span><span class="cl">Refutation:</span> In that case, it was allowed because he had consecutive periods of mourning:</p>
<p class="bas indent2"><span class="nm">1.</span><span class="cl">(Beraisa):</span> If a person had consecutive periods of mourning, then if his hair grows overly long, he can cut it with a razor, and he can wash his clothes in water.</p>

<p class="bas indent1"><span class="nm">(f)</span><span class="cl">Alternate version: (Rava):</span> A mourner may not bathe in cold water during the seven days of mourning.</p>
<p class="bas indent1"><span class="nm">(g)</span>It is different from meat and wine, which are permitted to help lessen one's sorrows.</p>
<p class="bas indent1"><span class="nm">(h)</span>A proof is suggested from a Beraisa:</p>
<p class="bas indent2"><span class="nm">1.</span>A Bogeres may not let herself appear ugly while mourning for her father.</p>

<p class="bas indent2"><span class="nm">1.</span><span class="cl">(R. Chisda):</span> If wearing makeup is forbidden, then so is washing clothes.</p>
<p class="bas indent1"><span class="nm">(j)</span>The Halachah is that a mourner may not wash his body whether in hot or cold water during the seven days.</p>
<p class="bas indent2"><span class="nm">1.</span>He may, however, wash his face, hands and feet in cold water.</p>
<p class="bas indent2"><span class="nm">2.</span>He may not anoint himself in even the slightest amount, except to remove sweat.</p>
<p class="bas subject"><span class="nm">3)</span>WHERE TO SAY <i>ANEINU</i></p>
<p class="bas indent1"><span class="nm">(a)</span><span class="cl">Question:</span> Where do we recite the Aneinu prayer?</p>
<p class="bas indent1"><span class="nm">(b)</span><span class="cl">Answer (R. Yehudah):</span> An individual in a private fast says Aneinu between the Berachos of Ge'ulah and Refuah.</p>
<p class="bas indent1"><span class="nm">(c)</span><span class="cl">Objection (R. Yitzchak):</span> Surely an individual cannot establish his own separate Berachah!?</p>
<p class="bas indent1"><span class="nm">(d)</span>Rather, he recites it within Shome'a Tefilah.</p>
<p class="bas indent2"><span class="nm">1.</span>R. Sheshes holds the same.</p>
<p class="bas indent1"><span class="nm">(e)</span><span class="cl">Question:</span> We see otherwise in a Beraisa:</p>
<p class="bas indent2"><span class="nm">1.</span><span class="cl">(Beraisa):</span> The difference between an individual and a Tzibur on a fast day is that one says eighteen Berachos and the other says nineteen.</p>
<p class="bas indent2"><span class="nm">2.</span>"Tzibur" cannot refer to the Shalich Tzibur, as he says twenty-four Berachos.</p>
<p class="bas indent2"><span class="nm">3.</span>It must refer to an individual who accepts a private fast, and an individual who accepts a Ta'anis Tzibur.</p>
<p class="bas indent2"><span class="nm">4.</span>We see that the latter may establish his own Berachah of Aneinu, thereby totaling nineteen Berachos!?</p>
<p class="bas indent1"><span class="nm">(f)</span><span class="cl">Answer:</span> It refers to a Shali'ach Tzibur, and it is discussing the first three fasts, when there are not twenty-four Berachos.</p>
<p class="bas indent1"><span class="nm">(g)</span><span class="cl">Question:</span> Surely it says that the only difference between the first three fasts and the latter fasts is regarding the prohibition of Melachah!?</p>
<p class="bas indent2"><span class="nm">1.</span><span class="cl">Answer:</span> It left out this other difference.</p>
<p class="bas indent2"><span class="nm">2.</span><span class="cl">Question #1:</span> What else was left out, such that we can say that this was left out?</p>
<p class="bas indent2"><span class="nm">3.</span><span class="cl">Question #2:</span> It says that this is the <i>only</i> difference!?</p>
<p class="bas indent1"><span class="nm">(h)</span><span class="cl">New answer:</span> The Tana is only referring to prohibitions, not to the forms of prayer.</p>
<p class="bas indent1"><span class="nm">(i)</span><span class="cl">Alternate answer:</span> The twenty-four Berachos are not recited in the middle series of fasts either.</p>
<p class="bas indent1"><span class="nm">(j)</span><span class="cl">Objection:</span> A Beraisa states that the only difference between the middle and last series of fasts is that in the latter, the Shofar is blown and the stores are locked!</p>
<p class="bas indent2"><span class="nm">1.</span><span class="cl">Suggested answer:</span> It left out this other difference.</p>
<p class="bas indent2"><span class="nm">2.</span><span class="cl">Refutation:</span> It says that this is the <i>only</i> difference!?</p>
<p class="bas indent2"><span class="nm">3.</span><span class="cl">Answer:</span> "Only" cannot be a precise term, as it also left out the difference that the Aron is only placed in the street for the latter fasts.</p>
<p class="bas indent2"><span class="nm">4.</span><span class="cl">Refutation:</span> That is not mentioned as it is done publicly.</p>
