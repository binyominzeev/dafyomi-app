<p class="bas subject"><span class="nm">1)</span>WHEN IS A SMALL MISTAKE PARDONED?</p>
<p class="bas indent1"><span class="nm">(a)</span><span class="cl">(Gemara) Question:</span> If Reuven told Shimon 'I sell to you a Beis Kor' (and did not mention measure by a rope, nor 'less or more'), what is the law?</p>
<p class="bas indent1"><span class="nm">(b)</span><span class="cl">Answer #1 (Mishnah):</span> If he said 'I sell to you a Beis Kor, measured by a rope', if it is any amount less, Shimon deducts from the price; if it is any amount more, Shimon returns the extra.</p>
<p class="bas indent2"><span class="nm">1.</span><span class="cl">Inference:</span> Had he not said this, there would be no compensation.</p>
<p class="bas indent1"><span class="nm">(c)</span><span class="cl">Objection (Seifa):</span> If he said 'be it less or more', even if there is a Rova too little or too much per Se'ah, there is no compensation.</p>
<p class="bas indent2"><span class="nm">1.</span>Had he not said this, there would be compensation!</p>
<p class="bas indent1"><span class="nm">(d)</span><span class="cl">Conclusion:</span> The inferences contradict one another. We cannot answer our question from the Mishnah, because we do not know which inference is correct.</p>
<p class="bas indent1"><span class="nm">(e)</span><span class="cl">Answer #2 (Beraisa):</span> If he said 'I sell to you a Beis Kor', 'I sell to you <i>approximately</i> a Beis Kor', 'I sell to you a Beis Kor, be it less or more', even if there is a Rova too little or too much per Se'ah, there is no compensation.</p>
<p class="bas indent2"><span class="nm">1.</span><span class="cl">Inference:</span> If he did not specify, it is as if he said 'be it less or more'!</p>
<p class="bas indent1"><span class="nm">(f)</span><span class="cl">Rejection:</span> The Beraisa does not give three separate cases, rather it all explains one case;</p>
<p class="bas indent2"><span class="nm">1.</span>It means, when is selling a Beis Kor like selling <i>approximately</i> a Beis Kor? It is if he said 'I sell to you a Beis Kor, be it less or more.</p>
<p class="bas indent1"><span class="nm">(g)</span><span class="cl">Objection (Rav Ashi):</span> If so, it should not say 'I sell to you' three times!</p>
<p class="bas indent2"><span class="nm">1.</span>Rather, the Beraisa settles our question. If he did not specify, it is as if he said 'be it less or more.'</p>
<p class="bas subject"><span class="nm">2)</span>WHAT IS RETURNED</p>
<p class="bas indent1"><span class="nm">(a)</span><span class="cl">(Mishnah):</span> He returns money to him...</p>
<p class="bas indent1"><span class="nm">(b)</span><span class="cl">Question:</span> Is it really true that we give the seller his choice, and not the buyer?!</p>
<p class="bas indent2"><span class="nm">1.</span><span class="cl">Contradiction (Beraisa):</span> If the amount of land was seven and a half Kavim per Kor too little or too much, the sale stands. If it was more than this, we force the seller to sell the extra (the buyer can say 'I do not want to have to guard myself from you') and the buyer to buy it (the seller has little use for a small field).</p>
<p class="bas indent1"><span class="nm">(c)</span><span class="cl">Answer:</span> Really, we do not force the seller to sell the extra land;</p>
<p class="bas indent2"><span class="nm">1.</span>The Beraisa teaches that if the value of the land declined, the buyer can say 'if you insist that I buy the extra land, I will pay only today's lower price.'</p>
<p class="bas indent1"><span class="nm">(d)</span><span class="cl">Question (Beraisa):</span> When the seller makes the buyer buy the extra land, it is according to the price at the time of the original sale.</p>
<p class="bas indent1"><span class="nm">(e)</span><span class="cl">Answer:</span> That is when the price increased.</p>
<p class="bas subject"><span class="nm">3)</span>WHEN THE SELLER CANNOT DEMAND MONEY</p>
<p class="bas indent1"><span class="nm">(a)</span><span class="cl">(Mishnah):</span> If the extra is Beis nine Kavim (he returns land).</p>
<p class="bas indent1"><span class="nm">(b)</span><span class="cl">(Rav Huna):</span> This applies even if there were nine extra Kavim in a sale of a giant valley.</p>
<p class="bas indent1"><span class="nm">(c)</span><span class="cl">(Rav Nachman):</span> It applies only if there were seven and a half extra Kavim for each Kor (if not, the extra is pardoned);</p>
<p class="bas bbbline">104b----------------------------------------104b</p>
<p class="bas indent1"><span class="nm">(d)</span>When (there is this much extra per Kor, and) the extra is nine Kavim, since it is a proper field, Reuven cannot force Shimon to buy it.</p>
<p class="bas indent1"><span class="nm">(e)</span><span class="cl">Question (Rava, against Rav Nachman - Mishnah):</span> If the extra is Beis nine Kavim in a field...</p>
<p class="bas indent2"><span class="nm">1.</span><span class="cl">Assumption:</span> (Even if) the field is two Kor, so there are only four and a half extra Kavim for each Kor, he must return it!</p>
<p class="bas indent1"><span class="nm">(f)</span><span class="cl">Answer (Rav Nachman):</span> No, he sold only one Kor.</p>
<p class="bas indent1"><span class="nm">(g)</span><span class="cl">Question (Rava - Mishnah):</span> Or half a Kav in a garden...</p>
<p class="bas indent2"><span class="nm">1.</span>The garden is Se'atayim, so there is only an extra Rova Kav for each Se'ah. Normally one pardons this, but since it is the size of a proper garden, he must return it!</p>
<p class="bas indent1"><span class="nm">(h)</span><span class="cl">Answer (Rav Nachman):</span> No, he sold only one Se'ah.</p>
<p class="bas indent1"><span class="nm">(i)</span><span class="cl">Question (Mishnah):</span> According to R. Akiva, a Beis Rova.</p>
<p class="bas indent2"><span class="nm">1.</span>The case is, the garden is one Se'ah.</p>
<p class="bas indent1"><span class="nm">(j)</span><span class="cl">Answer:</span> No, he sold only a half Se'ah.</p>
<p class="bas indent1"><span class="nm">(k)</span><span class="cl">Question (Rav Ashi):</span> If he sold a field, and there was more than an extra Rova for each Se'ah, and the total was at least a half Se'ah but less than nine Kavim, and the land became fit for a garden, or vice-versa (he sold a garden, now it is only fit for a field), what is the law?</p>
<p class="bas indent1"><span class="nm">(l)</span>This question is not resolved.</p>
<p class="bas indent1"><span class="nm">(m)</span><span class="cl">(Beraisa):</span> If Reuven kept a field bordering the sold field, Shimon can insist that Reuven take back the extra land (it is fitting for him), even if it is less than nine Kavim.</p>
<p class="bas indent1"><span class="nm">(n)</span><span class="cl">Questions (Rav Ashi):</span> If any of the following separate between Reuven's field and the field he sold: a pit, an irrigation channel, a Reshus ha'Rabim, or a row of date trees, what is the law?</p>
<p class="bas indent1"><span class="nm">(o)</span>These questions are not resolved.</p>
<p class="bas indent1"><span class="nm">(p)</span><span class="cl">(Mishnah):</span> He does not return just the Rova for each Se'ah. He returns all the extra land.</p>
<p class="bas indent1"><span class="nm">(q)</span><span class="cl">Question:</span> Just the contrary! The Chidush is that he returns the extra Rova'im!</p>
<p class="bas indent1"><span class="nm">(r)</span><span class="cl">Answer (Ravin bar Rav Nachman):</span> Indeed, the text should say 'he does not just return the extra above the Reva'im. He returns the extra Reva'im as well.</p>
