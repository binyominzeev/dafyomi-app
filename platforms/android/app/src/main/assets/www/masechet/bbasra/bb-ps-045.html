<p class="bas subject"><span class="nm">1)</span>RESPONSIBILITY OF A SELLER FOR WHAT HE SOLD</p>
<p class="bas indent1"><span class="nm">(a)</span><span class="cl">(Ravin bar Shmuel):</span> If Reuven sold his field without Achrayus, he cannot testify about it, since this can enable his creditor to collect it.</p>
<p class="bas indent1"><span class="nm">(b)</span><span class="cl">Question:</span> What is the case?</p>
<p class="bas indent2"><span class="nm">1.</span>If Reuven has other land, the creditor must collect from it, and not from what Reuven sold!</p>
<p class="bas indent2"><span class="nm">2.</span>If Reuven has no other land, it makes no difference to him whether or not the creditor collects from the sold land. In any case the creditor has nothing to take from Reuven himself!</p>
<p class="bas indent1"><span class="nm">(c)</span><span class="cl">Answer:</span> Rather, Reuven has no other land. He wants the creditor to collect, lest Reuven be considered "Loveh Rasha v'Lo Yeshalem."</p>
<p class="bas indent1"><span class="nm">(d)</span><span class="cl">Question:</span> Even if the creditor collects, Reuven will be like one who borrowed (from the buyer) and does not pay!</p>
<p class="bas indent1"><span class="nm">(e)</span><span class="cl">Answer:</span> No, he sold it without Achrayus to evade any liability to compensate the buyer.</p>
<p class="bas indent1"><span class="nm">(f)</span><span class="cl">(Rava):</span> If Shimon bought Levi's donkey, and a Nochri seized it, Levi must take the Nochri to Beis Din to restore it to Shimon (Rashbam; Tosfos - he must compensate Shimon for his loss), so he will not be considered a borrower who does not repay.</p>
<p class="bas indent2"><span class="nm">1.</span>This is only if Shimon does not know whether the Nochri really owned it. If he admits that Levi owned the donkey, Levi is exempt.</p>
<p class="bas indent2"><span class="nm">2.</span>This is only if the Nochri took the donkey without the saddle (this shows that he is not stealing, rather, he truly owns it). If he also took the saddle, (presumably he is stealing, so) Levi is exempt.</p>
<p class="bas indent1"><span class="nm">(g)</span><span class="cl">(Ameimar):</span> In every case, Levi is exempt;</p>
<p class="bas indent2"><span class="nm">1.</span>Nochrim are established robbers - "their mouth speaks falsely...."</p>
<p class="bas subject"><span class="nm">2)</span>A CRAFTSMAN HAS NO CHAZAKAH</p>
<p class="bas indent1"><span class="nm">(a)</span><span class="cl">(Mishnah):</span> A craftsman does not get a Chazakah...</p>
<p class="bas indent1"><span class="nm">(b)</span><span class="cl">(Rabah):</span> This is only if witnesses saw Reuven (the owner) give to Shimon (the craftsman) the Keli;</p>
<p class="bas indent2"><span class="nm">1.</span>If not, Migo that Shimon would be believed if he denied ever receiving it, he is believed to say that he bought it.</p>
<p class="bas indent1"><span class="nm">(c)</span><span class="cl">Question (Abaye):</span> If so, even if witnesses saw him give it, Migo that Shimon could say that he returned it, he can say that he bought it!</p>
<p class="bas indent1"><span class="nm">(d)</span><span class="cl">Answer (Rabah):</span> You think that one who accepts a deposit in front of witnesses need not return it with witnesses. This is wrong. Rather, he must return it in front of witnesses.</p>
<p class="bas bbbline">45b----------------------------------------45b</p>
<p class="bas indent1"><span class="nm">(e)</span><span class="cl">Question (Abaye - Beraisa):</span> If Levi saw his slave with a craftsman (who teaches his trade), or his garment with a launderer, and Yehudah (the craftsman or 1aunderer) claims that he bought or received it (or him) for a gift, he is not believed;</p>
<p class="bas indent2"><span class="nm">1.</span>If he claims that he saw Levi tell him to sell or give it (or him), he is believed. (We immediately explain the Seifa, even though the question against Rabah is from the Reisha.)</p>
<p class="bas indent2"><span class="nm">2.</span><span class="cl">Question:</span> What is the difference between the Reisha and Seifa?</p>
<p class="bas indent2"><span class="nm">3.</span><span class="cl">Answer (Rabah):</span> In the Seifa, Ploni (a third party) has the garment or slave, and he claims 'I saw Levi tell Yehudah to sell or give it (or him) to me';</p>
<p class="bas indent3"><span class="nm">i.</span>Migo that Ploni would be believed to say that he bought it from Levi, he is believed to say that Levi told Yehudah to sell it to him.</p>
<p class="bas indent2"><span class="nm">4.</span><span class="cl">(The question against Rabah):</span> The Reisha teaches that when Levi sees his property with Yehudah, Yehudah is not believed;</p>
<p class="bas indent2"><span class="nm">5.</span><span class="cl">Question:</span> What is the case?</p>
<p class="bas indent3"><span class="nm">i.</span>If witnesses saw Levi give it to Yehudah, even if Levi does not see it with him, Yehudah is liable (according to Rabah, the deposit must be returned in front of witnesses)!</p>
<p class="bas indent2"><span class="nm">6.</span><span class="cl">Answer:</span> Rather, he did not give it in front of witnesses, and the Beraisa says that when Levi sees it with Yehudah, Yehudah is not believed!</p>
<p class="bas indent1"><span class="nm">(f)</span><span class="cl">Answer (Rabah):</span> Rather, Levi gave it to Yehudah in front of witnesses, and still, Yehudah is liable only if Levi sees it with him.</p>
<p class="bas indent1"><span class="nm">(g)</span><span class="cl">Abaye:</span> You yourself said that a deposit given in front of witnesses must be returned in front of witnesses!</p>
<p class="bas indent1"><span class="nm">(h)</span><span class="cl">Rabah:</span> I retracted from that teaching.</p>
<p class="bas indent1"><span class="nm">(i)</span><span class="cl">Question (against Abaye, and support for Rabah - Rava - Beraisa):</span> Reuven gave his garment to Shimon (a craftsman). Shimon said 'you hired me for two', and Reuven said 'I hired you for one.' If Shimon has the garment, Reuven must bring proof (or pay two);</p>
<p class="bas indent2"><span class="nm">1.</span>If he returned the garment to Reuven, if it is within the time to claim his wages, Shimon swears that he was not paid and collects;</p>
<p class="bas indent2"><span class="nm">2.</span>If it is after the time to claim his wages, Shimon must bring proof in order to collect.</p>
<p class="bas indent2"><span class="nm">3.</span><span class="cl">Question:</span> What is the case?</p>
<p class="bas indent3"><span class="nm">i.</span>If he gave the garment in front of witnesses, we ask the witnesses what the wage was!</p>
<p class="bas indent2"><span class="nm">4.</span><span class="cl">Answer:</span> Rather, he did not give it in front of witnesses, and the craftsman is believed;</p>
<p class="bas indent3"><span class="nm">i.</span>Migo he is believed to say that he bought it, he is believed that he was hired for two.</p>
