<p class="bas subject"><span class="nm">1)</span>THINGS A WOMAN MAY WEAR OUTSIDE ON SHABBOS</p>
<p class="bas indent1"><span class="nm">(a)</span><span class="cl">(Mishnah) Question:</span> What may a woman wear outside, and what is forbidden? (Mishnayos starting on 64B will detail what is permitted.)</p>
<p class="bas indent1"><span class="nm">(b)</span><span class="cl">Answer:</span> She may not go out with threads of wool or linen in her head, or ribbons;</p>
<p class="bas indent1"><span class="nm">(c)</span>She may not immerse with them unless she loosens them.</p>
<p class="bas indent1"><span class="nm">(d)</span>She may not go out with Totefes or Sarbitin (the various ornaments are explained later) if they are not sewn [into a headdress that covers her hair];</p>
<p class="bas indent1"><span class="nm">(e)</span>She may not go out with Kavul to Reshus ha'Rabim, nor with Ir Shel Zahav, nor with Katla, nose rings or rings without a stamp, or a needle without a hole;</p>
<p class="bas indent2"><span class="nm">1.</span>If she went out with any of these, she is exempt.</p>
<p class="bas indent1"><span class="nm">(f)</span><span class="cl">(Gemara) Question:</span> Why does the Mishnah mention immersing [while wearing Kelim that she may not wear]?</p>
<p class="bas indent1"><span class="nm">(g)</span><span class="cl">Answer (Rav Nachman bar Yitzchak):</span> This clause is the reason for the previous one:</p>
<p class="bas indent2"><span class="nm">1.</span>She may not go out with threads of wool or linen because Chachamim require her to remove them before immersing, even during the week - if she will wear them on Shabbos, perhaps she will have to immerse, and she will remove them and carry them four Amos in Reshus ha'Rabim!</p>
<p class="bas indent1"><span class="nm">(h)</span><span class="cl">Question (Rav Kahana):</span> What is the law regarding [woven] chains of threads?</p>
<p class="bas indent1"><span class="nm">(i)</span><span class="cl">Answer (Rav):</span> Anything woven is permitted [it cannot be made tight, therefore it need not be removed].</p>
<p class="bas indent1"><span class="nm">(j)</span><span class="cl">Version #1 (Rav Huna brei d'Rav Yehoshua):</span> Anything woven is permitted.</p>
<p class="bas indent1"><span class="nm">(k)</span><span class="cl">Version #2 (Rav Huna brei d'Rav Yehoshua):</span> I saw that my sisters are not particular to remove them [when bathing, for they do not obstruct water at all, all the more so one need not remove them to immerse].</p>
<p class="bas indent1"><span class="nm">(l)</span><span class="cl">Question:</span> What is the difference between these versions?</p>
<p class="bas indent1"><span class="nm">(m)</span><span class="cl">Answer:</span> They argue about when they are dirty:</p>
<p class="bas indent2"><span class="nm">1.</span>Version #1 permits them, for they are woven; Version #2 forbids them, for one removes them [when immersing] for one's own cleanliness.</p>
<p class="bas subject"><span class="nm">2)</span>WHICH THREADS ARE A <i>CHATZITZAH</i>?</p>
<p class="bas indent1"><span class="nm">(a)</span><span class="cl">(Mishnah):</span> The following are a Chatzitzah on a person - threads of wool or linen or ribbons in a girl's head;</p>
<p class="bas indent1"><span class="nm">(b)</span>R. Yehudah says, [threads of] wool or hair are not a Chatzitzah, because water goes through them.</p>
<p class="bas indent1"><span class="nm">(c)</span><span class="cl">(Rav Huna):</span> [Not only ribbons, but] also the threads discussed are in a girl's head.</p>
<p class="bas indent1"><span class="nm">(d)</span><span class="cl">Question (Rav Yosef):</span> What does Rav Huna come to exclude?</p>
<p class="bas indent1"><span class="nm">(e)</span><span class="cl">Answer:</span> He excludes threads on the neck (all agree that they are not a Chatzitzah).</p>
<p class="bas indent1"><span class="nm">(f)</span><span class="cl">Question:</span> What kind of threads [on the neck] does he exclude?</p>
<p class="bas indent2"><span class="nm">1.</span>They cannot be wool - the first Tana says that something soft (wool) tied on something hard (the hair on her head) is a Chatzitzah, all the more so soft on soft (the neck) is a Chatzitzah (for it can be tied more tightly)!</p>
<p class="bas indent1"><span class="nm">(g)</span><span class="cl">Answer #1:</span> They are linen.</p>
<p class="bas indent1"><span class="nm">(h)</span><span class="cl">Rejection:</span> The first Tana says that hard (linen) on hard is a Chatzitzah, all the more so hard on soft!</p>
<p class="bas indent1"><span class="nm">(i)</span><span class="cl">Answer #2:</span> [They can be any material -] threads on the neck are not a Chatzitzah because a woman does not tie them tightly, lest she choke herself.</p>
<p class="bas indent1"><span class="nm">(j)</span><span class="cl">Question (Abaye - Beraisa):</span> Girls may go out with strings in their [pierced] ears (to prevent the holes from closing), but not with Chavakin (bands) wrapped around their necks.</p>
<p class="bas indent2"><span class="nm">1.</span>If a woman does not tie tightly around her neck, Chavakin should be permitted!</p>
<p class="bas indent1"><span class="nm">(k)</span><span class="cl">Answer (Ravina):</span> The Beraisa discusses [thick] Katla'os tied tightly to make her neck look stout (since they are thick, they do not choke her. Tosfos - Katla of the Mishnah is loose, one may not go out with it lest she remove it to show to friends and carry it.)</p>
<p class="bas bbbline">57b----------------------------------------57b</p>
<p class="bas indent1"><span class="nm">(l)</span><span class="cl">(Beraisa - R. Yehudah):</span> [Threads of] wool or hair are not a Chatzitzah, because water goes through them.</p>
<p class="bas indent1"><span class="nm">(m)</span><span class="cl">(Rav Yosef):</span> The Halachah follows R. Yehudah regarding threads of hair.</p>
<p class="bas indent1"><span class="nm">(n)</span><span class="cl">Objection (Abaye):</span> This implies that Chachamim argue about threads of hair (but we have no source to say this)!</p>
<p class="bas indent2"><span class="nm">1.</span><span class="cl">Suggestion:</span> We must say that the first Tana also discussed threads of hair, for otherwise R. Yehudah would not have discussed them!</p>
<p class="bas indent2"><span class="nm">2.</span><span class="cl">Rejection:</span> Perhaps R. Yehudah says, just like you agree with me that threads of hair are not a Chatzitzah, you should agree that threads of wool are not a Chatzitzah!</p>
<p class="bas indent1"><span class="nm">(o)</span><span class="cl">(Rav Nachman):</span> Chachamim agree that threads of hair are not a Chatzitzah.</p>
<p class="bas indent1"><span class="nm">(p)</span><span class="cl">Support (Beraisa):</span> Threads of wool are a Chatzitzah, threads of hair are not a Chatzitzah;</p>
<p class="bas indent1"><span class="nm">(q)</span>R. Yehudah says, neither of these is a Chatzitzah.</p>
<p class="bas indent1"><span class="nm">(r)</span><span class="cl">(Rav Nachman bar Yitzchak):</span> We can also derive this from a Mishnah (64B):</p>
<p class="bas indent2"><span class="nm">1.</span><span class="cl">(Mishnah):</span> A woman may go out with threads of hair, whether they are hers or of someone else.</p>
<p class="bas indent2"><span class="nm">2.</span><span class="cl">Question:</span> Who is the Tana of the Mishnah?</p>
<p class="bas indent2"><span class="nm">3.</span>It is not R. Yehudah - he permits even threads of wool (a bigger Chidush, he would have taught this)!</p>
<p class="bas indent2"><span class="nm">4.</span><span class="cl">Answer:</span> It is Chachamim - this shows that they agree about threads of hair.</p>
<p class="bas subject"><span class="nm">3)</span>WEARING ADORNMENTS OF THE HEAD ON SHABBOS</p>
<p class="bas indent1"><span class="nm">(a)</span><span class="cl">(Mishnah):</span> She may not go out with Totefes.</p>
<p class="bas indent1"><span class="nm">(b)</span><span class="cl">Question:</span> What is Totefes?</p>
<p class="bas indent1"><span class="nm">(c)</span><span class="cl">Answer #1 (Rav Yosef):</span> It is a Kesher (spices wrapped together; alternatively, pearls) worn around the neck to counter Ayin Ra'ah.</p>
<p class="bas indent1"><span class="nm">(d)</span><span class="cl">Objection (Abaye):</span> If so, it should be permitted, like a Kemi'a!</p>
<p class="bas indent1"><span class="nm">(e)</span><span class="cl">Answer #2 (Rav Yehudah):</span> It is an ornament worn on the forehead.</p>
<p class="bas indent1"><span class="nm">(f)</span><span class="cl">Support (Beraisa):</span> A woman may go out with a golden headdress, and with Totefes or Sarbitin fixed in it. (The Kesher for Ayin Ra'ah is not usually put in the headdress (Tosfos ha'Rosh) - we cannot support Rav Yehudah from [the following] Amora'im, the support must be from the Beraisa itself.)</p>
<p class="bas indent1"><span class="nm">(g)</span><span class="cl">(R. Avahu):</span> Totefes goes from one ear to the other, Sarbitin reaches until the jaws.</p>
<p class="bas indent1"><span class="nm">(h)</span><span class="cl">(Rav Huna):</span> Poor girls make them from colored strings (Tosfos ha'Rosh - nevertheless, we are concerned lest they remove them to show friends), rich girls make them from silver or gold.</p>
<p class="bas indent1"><span class="nm">(i)</span><span class="cl">(Mishnah):</span> She may not go out [to Reshus ha'Rabim] with Kavul (this can refer to a sign showing that the wearer is a slave, or to a woolen cap worn for a Tachshit under her headdress).</p>
<p class="bas indent1"><span class="nm">(j)</span><span class="cl">Question (R. Yanai):</span> Does the Mishnah discuss a signet [of slavery] - but one may wear a cap in Reshus ha'Rabim (she is unlikely to remove it, lest her hair will be exposed);</p>
<p class="bas indent2"><span class="nm">1.</span>Or, does it forbid a cap, and all the more so a signet (she might remove it to avoid publicizing that she is a slave)!</p>
<p class="bas indent1"><span class="nm">(k)</span><span class="cl">Answer #1 (R. Avahu):</span> Presumably, it discusses a cap.</p>
<p class="bas indent1"><span class="nm">(l)</span><span class="cl">Support (Beraisa):</span> A woman may go out with a Kavul or Istama (this will be defined) in a Chatzer;</p>
<p class="bas indent2"><span class="nm">1.</span>R. Shimon ben Elazar permits to go out to Reshus ha'Rabim with a Kavul.</p>
<p class="bas indent2"><span class="nm">2.</span>R. Shimon ben Elazar says, the general rule is - she may go out with anything under the headdress, not with something over the headdress.</p>
<p class="bas indent1"><span class="nm">(m)</span><span class="cl">Question:</span> What is Istama?</p>
<p class="bas indent1"><span class="nm">(n)</span><span class="cl">Answer (R. Avahu):</span> It is Bizyoni.</p>
<p class="bas indent1"><span class="nm">(o)</span><span class="cl">Question:</span> What is Bizyoni?</p>
<p class="bas indent1"><span class="nm">(p)</span><span class="cl">Answer (Abaye):</span> It is felt used to tie down hairs that leave the headdress (Rashi; Aruch - to tie down the apparel on her head; alternatively, they are strings to deter flies).</p>
<p class="bas indent1"><span class="nm">(q)</span><span class="cl">(Beraisa):</span> Three Halachos were taught regarding Istama:</p>
<p class="bas indent2"><span class="nm">1.</span>Sha'atnez does not apply to it; (Rashi - for felt is not spun. Tosfos - mid'Rabanan, Sha'atnez applies to felt, for the wool and linen were each Shu'a (combed) - Chachamim did not forbid Istama, for it is hard and does not give warmth. Ramban - it is not worn for the sake of a garment, only for a Tachshit.)</p>
<p class="bas indent2"><span class="nm">2.</span>Tzara'as does not apply to it (for it is not considered a garment. Ramban - no Tum'ah applies to it; Tosfos - it is Mekabel other Tum'os);</p>
<p class="bas indent2"><span class="nm">3.</span>One may go out with it to Reshus ha'Rabim;</p>
<p class="bas indent2"><span class="nm">4.</span>R. Shimon adds a fourth Halachah - the decree against crowns of brides [to limit Simchah after the Churban] does not apply to it.</p>
