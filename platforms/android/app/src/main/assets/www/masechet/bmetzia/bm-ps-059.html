<p class="bas subject"><span class="nm">1)</span>THE EVIL OF <i>ONA'AH</i></p>
<p class="bas indent1"><span class="nm">(a)</span><span class="cl">(Rabah bar bar Chanah):</span> Making someone blush is worse than having Bi'ah with a doubtfully married woman.</p>
<p class="bas indent1"><span class="nm">(b)</span><span class="cl">(Rava):</span> He learns from "Kor'u v'Lo Damu" - David said 'if I would be torn, my blood would not spill';</p>
<p class="bas indent2"><span class="nm">1.</span>Even when my tormentors are learning about Tzara'as and Tum'as Ohel (the most difficult tractates), they ask me 'which death penalty is given for Bi'ah with a married woman?'</p>
<p class="bas indent2"><span class="nm">2.</span>I answer 'it is strangulation, and he has a share in the world to come, but one who makes someone blush has no share in the world to come.'</p>
<p class="bas indent1"><span class="nm">(c)</span><span class="cl">(Mar Zutra bar Tuvya):</span> It is better to cast oneself into a lit furnace than to make someone blush;</p>
<p class="bas indent2"><span class="nm">1.</span>We learn from Tamar - "Hi Mutzeis v'Hi Sholchah" (she did not save herself from being burned by saying that she was pregnant from Yehudah, for it would have embarrassed him).</p>
<p class="bas indent1"><span class="nm">(d)</span><span class="cl">(Rav Chanina brei d'Rav Idi):</span> "Lo Sonu Ish Es <i>Amiso</i>" refers to one's fellowman, i.e. he also observes Torah and Mitzvos.</p>
<p class="bas indent1"><span class="nm">(e)</span><span class="cl">(Rav):</span> A man must be very careful not to afflict his wife. Women are prone to cry, and Hash-m is quick to punish when the victim cries.</p>
<p class="bas indent1"><span class="nm">(f)</span><span class="cl">(R. Elazar):</span> The gates of prayer were locked from the time of the destruction of the Mikdash - "Sasam Tefilasi";</p>
<p class="bas indent2"><span class="nm">1.</span>Even so, the gates of tears were not locked - "Dim'asi Al Techerash".</p>
<p class="bas indent1"><span class="nm">(g)</span><span class="cl">(Rav):</span> Anyone who follows his wife's counsel falls to Gehinom. We learn from Achav.</p>
<p class="bas indent1"><span class="nm">(h)</span><span class="cl">Question (Rav Papa):</span> People say 'if your wife is short, bend down to listen to her'!</p>
<p class="bas indent1"><span class="nm">(i)</span><span class="cl">Answer #1:</span> In matters of the house, listen to her, but not regarding worldly matters.</p>
<p class="bas indent1"><span class="nm">(j)</span><span class="cl">Answer #2:</span> In worldly matters, listen to her, but not regarding spiritual matters.</p>
<p class="bas indent1"><span class="nm">(k)</span><span class="cl">(Rav Chisda):</span> All the gates (of prayer) were locked, except for gates of (one who suffered) affliction - "Hash-m Nitzav Al Chomas Anach."</p>
<p class="bas indent1"><span class="nm">(l)</span><span class="cl">(R. Elazar):</span> Hash-m punishes for everything through a Shali'ach, except for affliction - "uv'Yado Anach."</p>
<p class="bas indent1"><span class="nm">(m)</span><span class="cl">(R. Avahu):</span> There are three sinners from whom Hash-m does not take His eyes off them until He punishes them - swindlers, robbers and idolaters.</p>
<p class="bas indent2"><span class="nm">1.</span>We learn about swindlers from "uv'Yado Anach";</p>
<p class="bas indent2"><span class="nm">2.</span>We learn about robbers from - "Chamas... Al Panai Tamid";</p>
<p class="bas indent2"><span class="nm">3.</span>We learn about idolaters from "ha'Mach'isim Osi Al Panai Tamid".</p>
<p class="bas subject"><span class="nm">2)</span>IMPORTANT COUNSEL FOR ONE'S HOME</p>
<p class="bas indent1"><span class="nm">(a)</span><span class="cl">(Rav Yehudah):</span> A man must be very careful not to lack grain in his house, for this causes constant quarrels - "Gevulech Shalom Chelev Chitim Yasbi'ech".</p>
<p class="bas indent1"><span class="nm">(b)</span><span class="cl">(Rav Papa):</span> People say that when barley is finished from the barrel, quarrels come.</p>
<p class="bas indent1"><span class="nm">(c)</span><span class="cl">(Rav Chinena):</span> A man must be very careful not to lack grain in his house, for Yisrael are called poor only due to lack of grain - "va'Yidal Yisrael Me'od".</p>
<p class="bas indent1"><span class="nm">(d)</span><span class="cl">(Rav Chelbo):</span> A man must be very careful to honor his wife properly, for Berachah is found in his house only due to her - "ul'Avram Heitiv Ba'avurah".</p>
<p class="bas indent2"><span class="nm">1.</span>Rava advised men of his city to honor their wives, in order that they will get rich.</p>
<p class="bas subject"><span class="nm">3)</span>TORAH IS NOT IN HEAVEN</p>
<p class="bas indent1"><span class="nm">(a)</span><span class="cl">(Mishnah - R. Eliezer):</span> The oven of Achnai is assembled rings of earthenware are, with sand in between them. It does not receive Tum'ah;</p>
<p class="bas indent1"><span class="nm">(b)</span>Chachamim say, it receives Tum'ah.</p>
<p class="bas bbbline">59b----------------------------------------59b</p>
<p class="bas indent1"><span class="nm">(c)</span><span class="cl">(Beraisa):</span> R. Eliezer gave all proofs in the world why it is Tahor; Chachamim did not accept them.</p>
<p class="bas indent2"><span class="nm">1.</span><span class="cl">R. Eliezer:</span> If the law is like me, this carob tree should show it. (The tree moved 100 Amos.)</p>
<p class="bas indent2"><span class="nm">2.</span><span class="cl">Chachamim:</span> We don't bring proof from a tree.</p>
<p class="bas indent2"><span class="nm">3.</span><span class="cl">R. Eliezer:</span> If the law is like me, the irrigation ditch should show it. (The water reversed the direction of its flow.)</p>
<p class="bas indent2"><span class="nm">4.</span><span class="cl">Chachamim:</span> We don't bring proof from an irrigation ditch.</p>
<p class="bas indent2"><span class="nm">5.</span><span class="cl">R. Eliezer:</span> If the law is like me, the walls of the Beis Medrash should show it. (The walls leaned to fall.)</p>
<p class="bas indent2"><span class="nm">6.</span><span class="cl">R. Yehoshua (to the walls):</span> We are arguing over Halachah. This is not your affair!</p>
<p class="bas indent3"><span class="nm">i.</span>The walls stopped falling, to honor R. Yehoshua. To this day they remain bent, in honor of R. Eliezer.</p>
<p class="bas indent2"><span class="nm">7.</span><span class="cl">R. Eliezer:</span> If the law is like me, Heaven should show it.</p>
<p class="bas indent2"><span class="nm">8.</span><span class="cl">(A voice from Heaven):</span> Why do you argue with R. Eliezer? The Halachah always follows him!</p>
<p class="bas indent2"><span class="nm">9.</span><span class="cl">R. Yehoshua:</span> It (the Halachah) is not in Heaven.</p>
<p class="bas indent1"><span class="nm">(d)</span><span class="cl">Question:</span> What does this mean?</p>
<p class="bas indent1"><span class="nm">(e)</span><span class="cl">Answer (R. Yirmiyah):</span> Once the Torah was given on Sinai, we do not heed voices from Heaven. Rather, we follow the majority of Chachamim - "Acharei Rabim Lehatos".</p>
<p class="bas indent1"><span class="nm">(f)</span><span class="cl">R. Nasan (to Eliyahu):</span> What was Hash-m doing at the time of that dispute?</p>
<p class="bas indent1"><span class="nm">(g)</span><span class="cl">Eliyahu:</span> He laughed and said 'My children <i>Nitzchuni</i>. (This could mean 'defeated Me', or 'made Me (My Torah) Eternal.')</p>
<p class="bas indent1"><span class="nm">(h)</span>That day, they burned all the food that was Tahor according to R. Eliezer (and Tamei according to Chachamim). They voted and excommunicated him. R. Akiva volunteered to inform him, lest someone else do this improperly.</p>
<p class="bas indent2"><span class="nm">1.</span>R. Akiva dressed in black, and sat four Amos away from R. Eliezer, who inquired about this. When he heard, he tore his clothing and removed his shoes (Rashi - like one who was excommunicated must do). He sat on the floor and cried. Olives, wheat and barley were stricken. Some say that even the dough in a woman's hands spoiled.</p>
<p class="bas indent2"><span class="nm">2.</span>Wherever R. Eliezer looked at was burned. R. Gamliel (the Nasi, who authorized the excommunication) was on a boat. A storm was about to sink it.</p>
<p class="bas indent2"><span class="nm">3.</span><span class="cl">R. Gamliel:</span> Hash-m, you know that I acted for Your honor, lest disputes increase in Yisrael! (The storm abated.)</p>
<p class="bas indent2"><span class="nm">4.</span>R. Eliezer's wife was R. Gamliel's sister. After this episode, she would not allow him to fall on his face (to say Tachanun, lest Hash-m avenge R. Eliezer's pain). One day, she did not stop him (she erred about which day was Rosh Chodesh, on which Tachanun is not said. Some say that she went to give bread to a poor person at the door). She found him on his face.</p>
<p class="bas indent2"><span class="nm">5.</span><span class="cl">His wife:</span> Get up! You killed my brother. (They then heard the announcement of his death.)</p>
<p class="bas indent2"><span class="nm">6.</span><span class="cl">R. Eliezer:</span> How did you know?</p>
<p class="bas indent2"><span class="nm">7.</span><span class="cl">His wife:</span> I have a tradition from my father's house (from David) that all the gates were locked, except for gates of Ona'ah.</p>
<p class="bas subject"><span class="nm">4)</span>AFFLICTION OF CONVERTS</p>
<p class="bas indent1"><span class="nm">(a)</span><span class="cl">(Beraisa):</span> One who (verbally) afflicts a convert transgresses three Lavim. One who pressures him (to pay a loan) transgresses two Lavim.</p>
<p class="bas indent1"><span class="nm">(b)</span><span class="cl">Objection:</span> Surely, the three Lavim of affliction are "v'Ger Lo Soneh", "v'Chi Yagur...", and "Lo Sonu Ish Es Amiso" (a convert is also 'your countryman').</p>
<p class="bas indent2"><span class="nm">1.</span>Similarly, one who pressures him transgresses "v'Lo Silchatzenu", "v'Ger Lo Silchatz", and "Ami... Lo Sihyeh Lo k'Nosheh" (a convert is also in 'My nation'!).</p>
<p class="bas indent1"><span class="nm">(c)</span><span class="cl">Correction:</span> Rather, one who pressures or afflicts a convert transgresses three Lavim.</p>
<p class="bas indent1"><span class="nm">(d)</span><span class="cl">(Beraisa - R. Eliezer ha'Gadol):</span> The Torah warns in 36 (some say - 46) places not to mistreat a convert, for he is prone to return to his former way.</p>
<p class="bas indent1"><span class="nm">(e)</span><span class="cl">Question:</span> What do we learn from "v'Ger Lo Soneh v'Lo Silchatzenu Ki Gerim Heyisem b'Eretz Mitzrayim"?</p>
<p class="bas indent1"><span class="nm">(f)</span><span class="cl">Answer (R. Nasan):</span> Do not point out in someone else a blemish that you yourself have.</p>
<p class="bas indent1"><span class="nm">(g)</span>People say that one in a family from which someone was hanged should not mention the word 'hang', for it recalls his shame.</p>
