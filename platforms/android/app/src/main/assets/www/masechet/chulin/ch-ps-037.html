<p class="dedicationbox">CHULIN 31-43 - Two weeks of study material have been dedicated by Mrs. Estanne Abraham Fawer to honor the Yahrzeit of her father, Rav Mordechai ben Eliezer Zvi (Rabbi Morton Weiner) Z'L, who passed away on 18 Teves 5760. May the merit of supporting and advancing Dafyomi study -- which was so important to him -- during the weeks of his Yahrzeit serve as an Iluy for his Neshamah. </p>

<div class="subject"><span class="nm">1)</span><p>IS CHIBAS HA'KODESH FULLY MACHSHIR?</p></div>
<div class="indent1"><span class="nm">(a)</span><p><span class="cl">Question:</span> Is Chibas ha'Kodesh Machshir only to become Pasul, or even to become Tamei? (This was Reish Lakish's question above.)</p></div>
<div class="indent1"><span class="nm">(b)</span><p>This question is unresolved.</p></div>
<div class="subject"><span class="nm">2)</span><p>A DANGEROUSLY SICK ANIMAL</p></div>
<div class="indent1"><span class="nm">(a)</span><p><span class="cl">(Mishnah - R. Shimon ben Gamliel):</span> If one slaughters a dangerously sick animal, it is permitted only if it quivers its foreleg or hind leg. (If it does not, it surely died before the Shechitah finished);</p></div>
<div class="indent1"><span class="nm">(b)</span><p>R. Eliezer says, it suffices if it coughs blood;</p></div>
<div class="indent1"><span class="nm">(c)</span><p>R. Shimon says, if one slaughters a dangerously sick animal at night, and finds the area of Shechitah covered with blood the next morning, it is permitted;</p></div>
<div class="indent2"><span class="nm">1.</span><p>This is like R. Eliezer.</p></div>
<div class="indent1"><span class="nm">(d)</span><p>Chachamim say, it must quiver a leg or wag its tail.</p></div>
<div class="indent2"><span class="nm">1.</span><p>This shows that it is Kosher, for a large or small animal.</p></div>
<div class="indent2"><span class="nm">2.</span><p>If a small animal stuck out a foreleg at the time of Shechitah and did not return it, this does not show that it is Kosher. It normally does so at the time of death.</p></div>
<div class="indent1"><span class="nm">(e)</span><p>All this applies to a sick animal, but a healthy animal is permitted even if it did none of these.</p></div>
<div class="indent1"><span class="nm">(f)</span><p><span class="cl">(Gemara) Question:</span> What is the source that a dangerously sick animal is permitted?</p></div>
<div class="indent2"><span class="nm">1.</span><p><span class="cl">Question:</span> Why should we think that it is not?</p></div>
<div class="indent2"><span class="nm">2.</span><p><span class="cl">Answer:</span> "This is the Chayah that you may eat" - Chayah (living) you may eat, but not what is not living;</p></div>
<div class="indent3"><span class="nm">i.</span><p>A dangerously sick animal is not considered living.</p></div>
<div class="indent1"><span class="nm">(g)</span><p><span class="cl">Answer #1:</span> "Do not eat a Neveilah" (an animal that died without Shechitah) implies that a dangerously sick animal is permitted.</p></div>
<div class="indent2"><span class="nm">1.</span><p>If a dangerously sick animal were forbidden, there would be no need to forbid it after it died!</p></div>
<div class="indent2"><span class="nm">2.</span><p><span class="cl">Suggestion:</span> Perhaps also a dangerously sick animal is called a Neveilah!</p></div>
<div class="indent2"><span class="nm">3.</span><p><span class="cl">Rejection:</span> "When an animal will die... its Neveilah (carcass)..." - it is a Neveilah only when it is dead.</p></div>
<div class="indent1"><span class="nm">(h)</span><p><span class="cl">Rejection:</span> Perhaps "this is the Chayah" forbids even a dangerously sick animal. When it is alive, an Aseh forbids it. After death, also a Lav forbids it.</p></div>
<div class="indent1"><span class="nm">(i)</span><p><span class="cl">Answer #2:</span> "Do not eat a Treifah" (an animal with a mortal injury or deficiency) implies that a dangerously sick animal is permitted.</p></div>
<div class="indent2"><span class="nm">1.</span><p>If a dangerously sick animal were forbidden, even though nothing is missing, there would be no need to forbid a Treifah!</p></div>
<div class="indent2"><span class="nm">2.</span><p><span class="cl">Suggestion:</span> Perhaps also a dangerously sick animal is called a Treifah. An Aseh and a Lav forbid it!</p></div>
<div class="indent2"><span class="nm">3.</span><p><span class="cl">Rejection:</span> If so, the Torah would not need to forbid a Neveilah!</p></div>
<div class="indent3"><span class="nm">i.</span><p>When it is alive, an Aseh and a Lav forbid it, so all the more so, after death!</p></div>
<div class="indent1"><span class="nm">(j)</span><p><span class="cl">Rejection:</span> Perhaps a dangerously sick animal is called Treifah and also Neveilah. An Aseh and two Lavim forbid it.</p></div>
<div class="indent1"><span class="nm">(k)</span><p><span class="cl">Answer #3:</span> We learned that "Chelev of a Treifah and Chelev of a Neveilah may be used for any use, but you may not eat it" teaches that the Lavim of Neveilah and Treifah take effect in addition to the Lav of Chelev.</p></div>
<div class="bbbline">37b----------------------------------------37b</p></div>
<div class="indent2"><span class="nm">1.</span><p>If also a dangerously sick animal were called a Treifah, the Torah should have said 'Chelev of a Neveilah may be used for any use. You may not eat Chelev of a Treifah'.</p></div>
<div class="indent3"><span class="nm">i.</span><p>We would deduce that since the Lav of Treifah takes effect in addition to the Lav of Chelev while the animal is alive, all the more so, the Lav of Neveilah takes effect in addition to the Lav of Chelev after it is dead!</p></div>
<div class="indent3"><span class="nm">ii.</span><p><span class="cl">Inference:</span> Rather, the verse forbids also Chelev of a Neveilah, because a dangerously sick animal is not called a Treifah.</p></div>
<div class="indent2"><span class="nm">2.</span><p><span class="cl">Question (Mar bar Rav Ashi):</span> Perhaps a dangerously sick animal really is called Treifah. "Chelev of a Neveilah" is needed for a Neveilah that was never dangerously sick!</p></div>
<div class="indent3"><span class="nm">i.</span><p><span class="cl">Question:</span> How can that be?</p></div>
<div class="indent3"><span class="nm">ii.</span><p><span class="cl">Answer:</span> The animal was cut into two pieces.</p></div>
<div class="indent2"><span class="nm">3.</span><p><span class="cl">Rejection:</span> Even in that case, it became dangerously sick a moment before the majority was cut. (This shows that Question (3) was unfounded.)</p></div>
<div class="indent1"><span class="nm">(l)</span><p><span class="cl">Answer #4:</span> If a dangerously sick animal were forbidden, the Torah should have said 'Chelev of a Neveilah or Treifah';</p></div>
<div class="indent2"><span class="nm">1.</span><p>Rather, it said "Chelev of a Treifah and Chelev of a Neveilah", to teach that in Neveilah and Treifah, the meat and the Chelev have the same law (both are forbidden), but in another case, i.e. a dangerously sick animal, their laws are different (the meat is permitted, but the Chelev is forbidden).</p></div>
<div class="indent1"><span class="nm">(m)</span><p><span class="cl">Answer #5:</span> Yechezkel said about himself "I did not make my soul Tamei. From my youth until now, I did not eat Neveilah or Treifah. Pigul (despised) meat did not enter my mouth."</p></div>
<div class="indent2"><span class="nm">1.</span><p>"I did not make my soul Tamei" - I did not emit semen at night due to thoughts about women during the day;</p></div>
<div class="indent2"><span class="nm">2.</span><p>"I never ate Neveilah or Treifah" - I did not eat from an animal that was hurriedly slaughtered before it died;</p></div>
<div class="indent2"><span class="nm">3.</span><p>"Pigul meat did not enter my mouth" - I did not eat from an animal that a Chacham needed to rule about (that it is indeed Kosher);</p></div>
<div class="indent3"><span class="nm">i.</span><p>R. Noson says, I did not eat from an animal before the gifts to the Kohen (the foreleg, jaws and stomach) were separated.</p></div>
<div class="indent2"><span class="nm">4.</span><p><span class="cl">(Summation of answer):</span> Granted, if a dangerously sick animal is permitted, Yechezkel said that he was more stringent than the law requires;</p></div>
<div class="indent3"><span class="nm">i.</span><p>If it were forbidden, what is the Chidush that he never transgressed?!</p></div>
