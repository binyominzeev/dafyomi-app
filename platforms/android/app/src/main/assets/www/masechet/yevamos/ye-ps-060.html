<div class="indent1"><span class="nm">(a)</span><p><span class="cl">Question:</span> The Beraisa says 'he is (i.e. may remain) married'!</p></div>
<div class="indent1"><span class="nm">(b)</span><p><span class="cl">Answer (Rav Acha bar Yakov):</span> (If an enticer does not marry the girl, he pays a fine.) He is married regarding exemption from the fine (but he must divorce her).</p></div>
<div class="indent1"><span class="nm">(c)</span><p><span class="cl">Question (Rav Ashi):</span> Rav and R. Yochanan say that he may not marry a Bogeres or Mukas Etz. If he married one of them, he is married!</p></div>
<div class="indent2"><span class="nm">1.</span><p>He may stay married because any girl he marries will eventually become a Bogeres and Mukas Etz (i.e. lose her Besulim) anyway.</p></div>
<div class="indent2"><span class="nm">2.</span><p>Here also he should be allowed to stay married, for any girl he marries will eventually have Bi'ah with him!</p></div>
<div class="indent1"><span class="nm">(d)</span><p>This question is left difficult.</p></div>
<div class="indent1"><span class="nm">(e)</span><p><span class="cl">(Beraisa):</span> He may not marry a woman raped or enticed by another man;</p></div>
<div class="indent1"><span class="nm">(f)</span><p>If he married her, R. Eliezer ben Yakov says that the son is a Chalal;</p></div>
<div class="indent1"><span class="nm">(g)</span><p>Chachamim say, he is Kosher.</p></div>
<div class="indent1"><span class="nm">(h)</span><p><span class="cl">Version #1 (Rav):</span> The Halachah follows R. Eliezer ben Yakov.</p></div>
<div class="indent1"><span class="nm">(i)</span><p><span class="cl">Version #2 - Question (Rav):</span> What is the reason of R. Eliezer ben Yakov?</p></div>
<div class="indent1"><span class="nm">(j)</span><p><span class="cl">Answer #1 (Rav):</span> He holds like R. Elazar (who says that a woman becomes a Zonah for Zenus).</p></div>
<div class="indent1"><span class="nm">(k)</span><p><span class="cl">Objection:</span> This cannot be!</p></div>
<div class="indent2"><span class="nm">1.</span><p>We hold that the teachings of R. Eliezer ben Yakov are Kav (few; R. Chananel - 102, the Gematriya of Kav) and clean (the Halachah always follows him).</p></div>
<div class="indent2"><span class="nm">2.</span><p><span class="cl">(Rav):</span> The Halachah does not follow R. Elazar.</p></div>
<div class="indent1"><span class="nm">(l)</span><p>This is left difficult.</p></div>
<div class="indent1"><span class="nm">(m)</span><p><span class="cl">Answer #2 (Rav Ashi):</span> R. Eliezer ben Yakov holds that a Chalal results from Chayavei Aseh. Chachamim say that it does not.</p></div>
<div class="indent2"><span class="nm">1.</span><p>R. Eliezer ben Yakov learns from "A widow, divorcee, Chalalah or Zonah, these he will not marry, but rather a virgin... he will not profane his seed". All these Isurim profane his seed;</p></div>
<div class="indent2"><span class="nm">2.</span><p>Chachamim say, the word "these" interrupts. Only Isurim listed before this word profane his seed.</p></div>
<div class="indent2"><span class="nm">3.</span><p>R. Eliezer ben Yakov says, "these" excludes a Nidah (she does not profane his seed).</p></div>
<div class="indent1"><span class="nm">(n)</span><p><span class="cl">Question:</span> Like whom is the following?</p></div>
<div class="indent2"><span class="nm">1.</span><p><span class="cl">(Beraisa):</span> A Chalal results from these, but not from a Nidah.</p></div>
<div class="indent1"><span class="nm">(o)</span><p><span class="cl">Answer:</span> It is like R. Eliezer ben Yakov.</p></div>
<div class="indent1"><span class="nm">(p)</span><p><span class="cl">Question:</span> According to R. Eliezer ben Yakov, the word "these" should have been written at the end (since all the Isurim mentioned make a Chalal)!</p></div>
<div class="indent1"><span class="nm">(q)</span><p>This is left difficult.</p></div>
<div class="subject"><span class="nm">2)</span><p>WHEN DOES A KOHEN BECOME TAMEI FOR HIS SISTER?</p></div>
<div class="indent1"><span class="nm">(a)</span><p><span class="cl">(Beraisa - R. Meir and R. Yehudah):</span> A Kohen makes himself Tamei to bury his sister if she was Mekudeshes;</p></div>
<div class="indent1"><span class="nm">(b)</span><p>R. Yosi and R. Shimon say that he does not.</p></div>
<div class="indent1"><span class="nm">(c)</span><p>If she was raped or enticed, all agree he is not Metamei himself for her.</p></div>
<div class="indent1"><span class="nm">(d)</span><p>R. Shimon says, if she is a Mukas Etz he is not Metamei himself, for a Kohen is Metamei himself for a sister only if she was permitted to a Kohen Gadol.</p></div>
<div class="indent1"><span class="nm">(e)</span><p>All say that he is Metamei himself for a Bogeres.</p></div>
<div class="indent1"><span class="nm">(f)</span><p><span class="cl">Question:</span> What is the reason of R. Meir and R. Yehudah?</p></div>
<div class="indent1"><span class="nm">(g)</span><p><span class="cl">Answer:</span> "For his virgin sister" excludes one who was raped or enticed.</p></div>
<div class="indent2"><span class="nm">1.</span><p><span class="cl">Suggestion:</span> We should exclude even a Mukas Etz!</p></div>
<div class="indent2"><span class="nm">2.</span><p><span class="cl">Rejection:</span> "Asher Lo <i>Haysah</i> l'Ish" - one whose Havayah (loss of virginity) was through a man. This excludes a Mukas Etz.</p></div>
<div class="indent1"><span class="nm">(h)</span><p>"Who is close" includes an Arusah. "To him" includes a Bogeres.</p></div>
<div class="indent1"><span class="nm">(i)</span><p><span class="cl">Question:</span> Why must a verse include Bogeres? R. Meir holds that "Besulah" includes one who has even some Besulim!</p></div>
<div class="indent1"><span class="nm">(j)</span><p><span class="cl">Answer:</span> One might have thought that a Gezeirah Shavah "Besulah-Besulah" from there (Rashi - a virgin that is raped; Tosfos - from a girl fit for a Kohen Gadol) teaches that she must be a Na'arah;</p></div>
<div class="indent2"><span class="nm">1.</span><p>The verse teaches unlike this.</p></div>
<div class="indent1"><span class="nm">(k)</span><p><span class="cl">Question:</span> How do R. Yosi and R. Shimon learn?</p></div>
<div class="indent1"><span class="nm">(l)</span><p><span class="cl">Answer:</span> "For his virgin sister" excludes one who was raped or enticed and a Mukas Etz;</p></div>
<div class="indent2"><span class="nm">1.</span><p>"Who was not (married)" excludes an Arusah; "that is close" includes an Arusah who was divorced;</p></div>
<div class="indent2"><span class="nm">2.</span><p>"To him" includes a Bogeres.</p></div>
<div class="indent2"><span class="nm">3.</span><p><span class="cl">Question:</span> How can "who is close" include an Arusah who was divorced? R. Shimon says that he is Metamei himself for a sister only if she may marry a Kohen Gadol!</p></div>
<div class="bbbline">60b----------------------------------------60b</p></div>
<div class="indent2"><span class="nm">4.</span><p><span class="cl">Answer:</span> This case is different. The Torah said "close" to include it.</p></div>
<div class="indent2"><span class="nm">5.</span><p><span class="cl">Question:</span> We should say that "close" also includes Mukas Etz!</p></div>
<div class="indent2"><span class="nm">6.</span><p><span class="cl">Answer:</span> It comes to include one case, but not two.</p></div>
<div class="indent2"><span class="nm">7.</span><p><span class="cl">Question:</span> Why do we say that it includes an Arusah who was divorced, and not a Mukas Etz?</p></div>
<div class="indent2"><span class="nm">8.</span><p><span class="cl">Answer:</span> A physical act happened to the latter, but not to the former.</p></div>
<div class="indent1"><span class="nm">(m)</span><p><span class="cl">Question:</span> R. Yosi did not say the law of Mukas Etz with his partner (R. Shimon), so he must hold like R. Meir. How does he expound?</p></div>
<div class="indent1"><span class="nm">(n)</span><p><span class="cl">Answer:</span> "Who was not to a man" includes a Mukas Etz.</p></div>
<div class="indent1"><span class="nm">(o)</span><p><span class="cl">Objection:</span> He already used that verse (to exclude an Arusah)!</p></div>
<div class="indent1"><span class="nm">(p)</span><p><span class="cl">Answer:</span> "Was not" excludes an Arusah. "To a man" includes a Mukas Etz.</p></div>
<div class="indent1"><span class="nm">(q)</span><p>"To him" includes a Bogeres.</p></div>
<div class="indent1"><span class="nm">(r)</span><p><span class="cl">Question:</span> R. Shimon said (regarding a Kohen Gadol) that "Besulah" connotes having all the Besulim! (Tosfos Yeshanim - he should learn from here that Besulah connotes even some Besulim, for a Bogeres is included!)</p></div>
<div class="indent1"><span class="nm">(s)</span><p><span class="cl">Answer:</span> He learned that from our verse;</p></div>
<div class="indent2"><span class="nm">1.</span><p>Since the Torah needed to write "To him" to include a Bogeres, we infer that "Besulah" connotes all the Besulim.</p></div>
<div class="subject"><span class="nm">3)</span><p>ARE ANY CONVERTS PERMITTED TO A KOHEN?</p></div>
<div class="indent1"><span class="nm">(a)</span><p><span class="cl">(Beraisa - R. Shimon):</span> A girl who converted before three years old may marry a Kohen. (Moshe told the soldiers who defeated Midyan) "Keep alive for yourselves all Taf (young girls) who did not have Bi'ah." Pinchas (a Kohen) was among those who were permitted!</p></div>
<div class="indent1"><span class="nm">(b)</span><p><span class="cl">Chachamim:</span> No. "Keep alive for yourselves" for slaves (it does not discuss marriage).</p></div>
<div class="indent1"><span class="nm">(c)</span><p><span class="cl">Question:</span> If so, even girls above three should be kept alive!</p></div>
<div class="indent1"><span class="nm">(d)</span><p><span class="cl">Answer - Question:</span> "Kill every <i>Ishah</i> who had Bi'ah with a man" implies that we keep alive (mature) women who did not have Bi'ah, and Taf even if they had Bi'ah;</p></div>
<div class="indent2"><span class="nm">1.</span><p><span class="cl">Contradiction:</span> "And all Taf who did not have Bi'ah, keep alive for yourselves" implies that if they did have Bi'ah, they are killed!</p></div>
<div class="indent2"><span class="nm">2.</span><p><span class="cl">Answer (Rav Huna):</span> Both verses obligate killing any female old enough to have Bi'ah.</p></div>
<div class="indent1"><span class="nm">(e)</span><p><span class="cl">Support (Beraisa):</span> "Every Ishah who had Bi'ah with a man" refers to women old enough to have Bi'ah;</p></div>
<div class="indent1"><span class="nm">(f)</span><p><span class="cl">Question:</span> Perhaps it means that actually had Bi'ah!</p></div>
<div class="indent1"><span class="nm">(g)</span><p><span class="cl">Answer:</span> It also says "And all Taf that did not have Bi'ah" (implying that we do not distinguish among older women). This shows that the Torah discusses being fit for Bi'ah.</p></div>
<div class="indent1"><span class="nm">(h)</span><p><span class="cl">Question:</span> How did they know which girls were fit for Bi'ah?</p></div>
<div class="indent1"><span class="nm">(i)</span><p><span class="cl">Answer (Rav Huna bar Bizna):</span> They passed the girls in front of the Tzitz (an ornament of the Kohen Gadol). A girl's face would turn green only if she was fit for Bi'ah.</p></div>
<div class="indent2"><span class="nm">1.</span><p><span class="cl">(Rav Nachman):</span> Hidrokan (a sickness in which the stomach swells, and the face green) is a sign of sin.</p></div>
<div class="indent1"><span class="nm">(j)</span><p><span class="cl">Question:</span> "Among the dwellers of Yavesh Gil'ad were found 400 virgin Na'aros that did not have Bi'ah" - how did they know?</p></div>
<div class="indent1"><span class="nm">(k)</span><p><span class="cl">Answer (Rav Kahana):</span> They sat each on a barrel of wine. The smell of the wine would pass through (to the mouth) only if she was not a Besulah.</p></div>
<div class="indent1"><span class="nm">(l)</span><p><span class="cl">Question:</span> Why didn't they pass them in front of the Tzitz?</p></div>
<div class="indent1"><span class="nm">(m)</span><p><span class="cl">Answer (Rav Kahana brei d'Rav Noson):</span> The Tzitz is "L'Ratzon Lahem", but not for punishments.</p></div>
<div class="indent1"><span class="nm">(n)</span><p><span class="cl">Question:</span> If so, it should not have been used for the captured Midianites!</p></div>
<div class="indent1"><span class="nm">(o)</span><p><span class="cl">Answer (Rav Ashi):</span> "Lahem (for Yisrael)" it is not for punishments. For Nochrim, it is even for punishments.</p></div>
<div class="indent1"><span class="nm">(p)</span><p><span class="cl">(R. Yakov bar Idi):</span> R. Yehoshua ben Levi said that the Halachah follows R. Shimon.</p></div>
<div class="indent2"><span class="nm">1.</span><p><span class="cl">R. Zeira:</span> Did you hear this explicitly, or did you derive it?</p></div>
<div class="indent3"><span class="nm">i.</span><p><span class="cl">Question:</span> How could this be derived?</p></div>
<div class="indent3"><span class="nm">ii.</span><p><span class="cl">Answer:</span> R. Yehoshua ben Levi said that protests were made (about the primary family of Kohanim) in a city in Eretz Yisrael. Rebbi sent R. Rumnus to check; he found a girl that converted before three [married into the family]. Rebbi permitted her.</p></div>
<div class="indent2"><span class="nm">2.</span><p><span class="cl">R. Yakov bar Idi:</span> I heard it explicitly.</p></div>
<div class="indent2"><span class="nm">3.</span><p><span class="cl">Question:</span> Had it been derived, what objection could be raised?</p></div>
<div class="indent2"><span class="nm">4.</span><p><span class="cl">Answer:</span> Perhaps once she was married, we would be lenient.</p></div>
<div class="indent2"><span class="nm">5.</span><p><span class="cl">Support (Rav and R. Yochanan):</span> A Kohen Gadol may not marry a Bogeres or Mukas Etz. If he married her, he is married.</p></div>
<div class="indent2"><span class="nm">6.</span><p><span class="cl">Rejection:</span> That is no support. There, whomever he will marry is destined to become a Bogeres and a non-virgin during the marriage. A Kohen's wife is not destined to become a Zonah during the marriage! (Therefore, we could derive the Halachah from the episode.)</p></div>
<div class="indent1"><span class="nm">(q)</span><p>Rav Safra derived the Halachah (from the episode), asked the question, and answered like we did.</p></div>
<div class="indent1"><span class="nm">(r)</span><p>A Kohen married a girl who converted before three years.</p></div>
