<p class="bas subject"><span class="nm">1)</span>THE <i>KORBAN</i> OF A CONVERT (cont.)</p>
<p class="bas indent1"><span class="nm">(a)</span><span class="cl">(Beraisa #2) Suggestion:</span> Perhaps "v'Asah Isheh Re'ach Nicho'ach la'Shem" teaches that a convert may bring anything consumed on the Mizbe'ach, even a Minchah!</p>
<p class="bas indent1"><span class="nm">(b)</span><span class="cl">Rejection:</span> "Ka'asher Ta'asu Ken Ya'aseh" - just like Bnei Yisrael offered Korbanos with blood, converts must do the same.</p>
<p class="bas indent1"><span class="nm">(c)</span><span class="cl">Suggestion:</span> Just like Bnei Yisrael offered Olos and Shelamim, converts must do similarly!</p>
<p class="bas indent1"><span class="nm">(d)</span><span class="cl">Rejection #1:</span> "Kachem ka'Ger Yihyeh" - converts are equated to Bnei Yisrael in some ways, but not regarding their Korban.</p>
<p class="bas indent1"><span class="nm">(e)</span><span class="cl">Rejection #2 (Rebbi):</span> "Kachem" teaches that converts are like the ancestors of Bnei Yisrael (who stood on Sinai);</p>
<p class="bas indent2"><span class="nm">1.</span>Just like the ancestors required circumcision, immersion and Zerikas Dam to make a covenant with Hash-m, also converts.</p>
<p class="bas indent2"><span class="nm">2.</span>We cannot say that one bird suffices, for we never find a Chiyuv to bring only one bird.</p>
<p class="bas indent1"><span class="nm">(f)</span><span class="cl">(Beraisa):</span> It is a leniency that he may bring a Kan.</p>
<p class="bas indent1"><span class="nm">(g)</span><span class="cl">Question (Beraisa) Question:</span> What do we learn from "v'Hikrivo"?</p>
<p class="bas indent2"><span class="nm">1.</span><span class="cl">Answer - Suggestion:</span> Regarding Torim (turtledoves) it says "v'Hikriv" (which connotes a full Korban). Perhaps one who vows to bring Olas ha'Of must bring at least two birds!</p>
<p class="bas indent2"><span class="nm">2.</span><span class="cl">Rejection:</span> "V'Hikrivo" permits bringing even one.</p>
<p class="bas indent1"><span class="nm">(h)</span><span class="cl">Answer:</span> That refers to Nedavah, but we never find a Chiyuv to bring only one bird.</p>
<p class="bas indent1"><span class="nm">(i)</span><span class="cl">Question:</span> A (rich) Yoledes brings only one bird, i.e. Chatas ha'Of!</p>
<p class="bas indent1"><span class="nm">(j)</span><span class="cl">Answer:</span> She brings also a lamb (Olas Behemah).</p>
<p class="bas indent1"><span class="nm">(k)</span><span class="cl">(Beraisa):</span> Just like the ancestors required...</p>
<p class="bas indent1"><span class="nm">(l)</span><span class="cl">Question:</span> Granted, we learn that circumcision was required from "Ki Muli Hayu Kol ha'Am ha'Yotz'im," or from "... va'Er'ech Misboseses b'Damayich va'Omar Lach b'Damayich Chayi... " (the redemption from Mitzrayim was in the merit of the bloods of circumcision and Korban Pesach);</p>
<p class="bas indent2"><span class="nm">1.</span>We learn that Zerikas Dam was required from "va'Yishlach Es Na'arei Bnei Yisrael (va'Ya'alu Olos va'Yizbechu Shelamim)";</p>
<p class="bas indent2"><span class="nm">2.</span>However, what is the source that immersion was required?</p>
<p class="bas indent1"><span class="nm">(m)</span><span class="cl">Answer:</span> "Va'Yikach Moshe Es ha'Dam va'Yizrok Al ha'Am" (he sprinkled the blood on Bnei Yisrael. This is unlike the Targum, which says that he sprinkled on the Mizbe'ach to atone for Bnei Yisrael);</p>
<p class="bas indent2"><span class="nm">1.</span>Whoever is sprinkled on must immerse. (R. Gershom - we learn from Haza'ah to be Metaher from Tum'as Mes. R. Tam (Yevamos 46b) - the Tevilah must precede the Haza'ah.)</p>
<p class="bas indent1"><span class="nm">(n)</span><span class="cl">Question:</span> Since the Korban is Me'akev, we should not accept converts nowadays!</p>
<p class="bas indent1"><span class="nm">(o)</span><span class="cl">Answer (Rav Acha bar Yakov):</span> "V'Chi Yagur Itchem Ger (... l'Doroseichem" teaches that we accept converts in all generations).</p>
<p class="bas indent1"><span class="nm">(p)</span><span class="cl">(Beraisa):</span> Nowadays, a convert must set aside a quarter-Dinar to buy a Kan (to offer immediately when the Mikdash will be rebuilt).</p>
<p class="bas indent1"><span class="nm">(q)</span>R. Shimon says, R. Yochanan ben Zakai made a quorum and repealed this, lest one benefit from the money (and transgress Me'ilah).</p>
<p class="bas indent1"><span class="nm">(r)</span><span class="cl">Version #1 (Rav Ada bar Ahavah):</span> The Halachah follows R. Shimon.</p>
<p class="bas indent1"><span class="nm">(s)</span><span class="cl">Version #2:</span> Rav Ada ruled like R. Shimon regarding a different law about a Ger:</p>
<p class="bas indent2"><span class="nm">1.</span><span class="cl">(Beraisa):</span> A Ger Toshav (a Ben Noach who accepted to keep his Mitzvos) may do those Melachos for himself on Shabbos that a Yisrael may do on Chol ha'Mo'ed (Devar ha'Eved, or if he has nothing to eat);</p>
<p class="bas indent2"><span class="nm">2.</span>R. Akiva says, he may do for himself what a Yisrael may do on Yom Tov (preparation of food);</p>
<p class="bas indent2"><span class="nm">3.</span>R. Yosi says, he may do anything for himself.</p>
<p class="bas indent2"><span class="nm">4.</span>R. Shimon says, the Halachah is the same for a Ger Toshav, Nochri or slave (who did not immerse to become an Eved Kena'ani) of a Yisrael. He may do anything for himself.</p>
<p class="bas subject"><span class="nm">2)</span>THOSE WHO BRING FOR <i>MEZID</i> LIKE <i>SHOGEG</i></p>
<p class="bas indent1"><span class="nm">(a)</span><span class="cl">(Mishnah):</span> The following bring a Korban for Mezid like for Shogeg. (In this entire discussion, Shifchah refers to Shifchah Charufah, a (some say half-freed) slave designated for an Eved Ivri.)</p>
<p class="bas indent2"><span class="nm">1.</span>One who has relations with a Shifchah, a Nazir who became Tamei Mes, one who swore falsely Shevu'as ha'Edus or Shevu'as ha'Pikadon.</p>
<p class="bas indent1"><span class="nm">(b)</span>There are five who bring one Korban for multiple transgressions. (Our Mishnah will list two of them. The other three are in the coming two Mishnayos.) There are five who bring Oleh v'Yored;</p>
<p class="bas indent2"><span class="nm">1.</span>The following bring one Korban for multiple transgressions - one who had several acts of relations with a Shifchah, and a Nazir who became Tamei Mes.</p>
<p class="bas indent1"><span class="nm">(c)</span><span class="cl">(Gemara) Question:</span> What is the source (to bring a Korban for Mezid) for relations with a Shifchah?</p>
<p class="bas indent1"><span class="nm">(d)</span><span class="cl">Answer (Beraisa):</span> "V'Chiper Alav ha'Kohen b'Eil ha'Asham <i>Al Chataso Asher Chata</i>" teaches that one ram atones for many sins;</p>
<p class="bas indent2"><span class="nm">1.</span>The repetition "v'Nislach Lo mi'Chataso Asher Chata" obligates for Mezid like for Shogeg.</p>
<p class="bas indent1"><span class="nm">(e)</span><span class="cl">(Mishnah):</span> A Nazir who became Tamei...</p>
<p class="bas indent1"><span class="nm">(f)</span><span class="cl">Question:</span> What is the source of this?</p>
<p class="bas indent1"><span class="nm">(g)</span><span class="cl">Answer (Beraisa #1):</span> "V'Chi Yamus Mes Alav <i>b'Fesa</i> Fis'om" refers to Shogeg -- "Im b'Fesa b'Lo Eivah";</p>
<p class="bas indent2"><span class="nm">1.</span>"Fis'om" refers to Ones - "va'Yomer Hash-m Pis'om El Moshe... (Hash-m forced them to come).</p>
<p class="bas indent1"><span class="nm">(h)</span><span class="cl">(Beraisa #2):</span> "Fis'om" refers to Mezid - "... U'Fesayim Avru v'Ne'enashu" (punishment is only for Mezid.)</p>
<p class="bas indent1"><span class="nm">(i)</span><span class="cl">Question:</span> It would suffice for the verse to say "Pis'om," for this connotes Shogeg, Mezid and Ones. Why must it say also "Fesa"?</p>
<p class="bas indent2"><span class="nm">1.</span>The Beraisos teach that it connotes Ones and Mezid. "Pesi Ya'amin l'Chol Davar" teaches that it connotes also Shogeg.</p>
<p class="bas indent1"><span class="nm">(j)</span><span class="cl">Answer:</span> Had it said only "Pis'om," we would learn only Shogeg, for most Korbanos are brought only for Shogeg;</p>
<p class="bas indent2"><span class="nm">1.</span>Therefore, it also writes "Fesa," to teach Shogeg, in order that we learn Ones and Mezid from Pis'om.</p>
<p class="bas indent1"><span class="nm">(k)</span><span class="cl">(Mishnah):</span> (One brings a Korban even for Mezid for) Shevu'as ha'Edus.</p>
<p class="bas indent1"><span class="nm">(l)</span><span class="cl">Question:</span> What is the source of this?</p>
<p class="bas indent1"><span class="nm">(m)</span><span class="cl">Answer (Beraisa):</span> Regarding all who bring Oleh v'Yored it says "v'Ne'elam," except for Shevu'as ha'Edus. This shows that for Shevu'as ha'Edus, one brings even for Mezid.</p>
<p class="bas indent1"><span class="nm">(n)</span><span class="cl">(Mishnah):</span> Shevu'as ha'Pikadon.</p>
<p class="bas indent1"><span class="nm">(o)</span><span class="cl">Question:</span> What is the source of this?</p>
<p class="bas indent1"><span class="nm">(p)</span><span class="cl">Answer:</span> We learn from a Gezeirah Shavah "Techeta-Techeta" from Shevu'as ha'Edus.</p>
<p class="bas indent1"><span class="nm">(q)</span><span class="cl">(Mishnah):</span> There are five who bring one Korban for multiple transgressions.</p>
<p class="bas indent1"><span class="nm">(r)</span><span class="cl">Question:</span> The Mishnah mentions many acts of relations with a Shifchah. What is the source of this?</p>

<p class="bas indent2"><span class="nm">1.</span>The repetition "v'Nislach Lo mi'Chataso Asher Chata" obligates for Mezid like for Shogeg.</p>
<p class="bas indent2"><span class="nm">2.</span><span class="cl">Question:</span> The verse discusses Mezid (the Shifchah is lashed. The Chidush is to be Mechayev for Shogeg! <span class="note"><span class="notewd">Note:</span> I do not know why the Gemara did not ask this above (e), when this Beraisa was brought to teach why one is liable for Mezid like for Shogeg!)</span></p>
<p class="bas indent2"><span class="nm">3.</span><span class="cl">Correction:</span> Rather, the repetition is Mechayev for Shogeg like for Mezid.</p>

<p class="bas indent1"><span class="nm">(a)</span><span class="cl">Question (R. Chanina Tirana'ah):</span> If one had relations with five Shifchos in one He'elem, what is the law?</p>
<p class="bas indent2"><span class="nm">1.</span>Is he liable for each, or only once?</p>
<p class="bas indent1"><span class="nm">(b)</span><span class="cl">Answer (R. Yochanan):</span> He is liable for each.</p>
<p class="bas indent1"><span class="nm">(c)</span><span class="cl">Question (R. Chanina):</span> Why is this different than five acts of relations with one Shifchah in five He'elamos? (Surely, the teaching that one is liable only once for many relations with one Shifchah applies to different He'elamos. In one He'elem, regarding all Arayos one is liable only once!)</p>
<p class="bas indent1"><span class="nm">(d)</span><span class="cl">Answer (R. Yochanan):</span> Here, the different Shifchos are Mechalek Korbanos.</p>
<p class="bas indent1"><span class="nm">(e)</span><span class="cl">Question (R. Chanina):</span> What is the source that Shifchos are Mechalek?</p>
<p class="bas indent1"><span class="nm">(f)</span><span class="cl">Answer (R. Yochanan):</span> Regarding Arayos it says "Ishah," different women are Mechalek Korbanos;</p>
<p class="bas indent2"><span class="nm">1.</span>Regarding Shifchah, "Ki Yishkav Es Ishah Shichvas Zera <i>v'Hi Shifchah</i>" teaches that different Shifchos are Mechalek.</p>

<p class="bas indent1"><span class="nm">(i)</span><span class="cl">Answer (Rav Chisda):</span> It is R. Yosi b'Rebbi Yehudah, who says that Nezirus Taharah begins on day seven (when he becomes Tahor);</p>
<p class="bas indent2"><span class="nm">1.</span>The case is, he repeatedly became Tamei on day seven from the previous Tum'ah. Since it was not yet time to bring Korban Nazir Tamei, one Korban exempts all the Tum'os.</p>
<p class="bas indent2"><span class="nm">2.</span>Our Mishnah cannot be like Rebbi, who says that Nezirus Taharah begins on day eight;</p>
<p class="bas indent3"><span class="nm">i.</span>If he became Tamei on day seven, he had not yet began Nezirus Taharah, it is like one Tum'ah. (It is no Chidush that he brings one Korban.)</p>
<p class="bas indent3"><span class="nm">ii.</span>If he became Tamei on day eight, he was already obligated to bring Korban Tum'ah, surely he must bring another Korban for the next Tum'ah!</p>

<p class="bas indent1"><span class="nm">(a)</span><span class="cl">(Mishnah):</span> (The following bring one Korban for multiple Chiyuvim --) a wife whose husband warned her about several men (not to be secluded with any one of them), and she was secluded with them (one at a time);</p>

<p class="bas indent1"><span class="nm">(e)</span><span class="cl">(Gemara) Question:</span> What is the source (regarding Sotah)?</p>
<p class="bas indent1"><span class="nm">(f)</span><span class="cl">Answer:</span> "Zos Toras (Toras is singular) ha'Kena'os" teaches that there is one Korban for many warnings.</p>

<p class="bas indent1"><span class="nm">(k)</span><span class="cl">Question:</span> (This implies that he will bring more birds for the new Tzara'as.) The Mishnah said that a Metzora brings one Korban for many Nega'im!</p>
<p class="bas indent1"><span class="nm">(l)</span><span class="cl">Answer:</span> The Mishnah is abbreviated. It means as follows:</p>
<p class="bas indent2"><span class="nm">1.</span>If a Metzora brought birds and was stricken again, he does not bring another Korban (more birds);</p>
<p class="bas indent2"><span class="nm">2.</span>His monetary status (an Ashir brings three animals, and an Oni brings one animal and two birds) is determined at the time he brings the Chatas;</p>
<p class="bas indent2"><span class="nm">3.</span>R. Yehudah says, it depends on when he brings the Asham.</p>
<p class="bas indent1"><span class="nm">(m)</span><span class="cl">(Mishnah - R. Shimon):</span> If a Metzora brought his Asham and then became rich, we consider his wealth only at the time he brings the Chatas. (If he was poor and brought Chatas ha'Of, he brings also Olas ha'Of);</p>
<p class="bas indent2"><span class="nm">1.</span>R. Yehudah says, it is determined at the time he brings the Asham.</p>
<p class="bas indent2"><span class="nm">2.</span><span class="cl">(Beraisa - R. Eliezer ben Yakov):</span> It is determined at the time he brings birds (before shaving).</p>
<p class="bas indent1"><span class="nm">(n)</span><span class="cl">(Rav Yehudah):</span> All these Tana'im learn from the same verse - "Asher Lo Tasig Yado b'Taharaso";</p>
<p class="bas indent2"><span class="nm">1.</span>R. Shimon holds that "b'Taharaso" refers to what is Mechaper, i.e. the Chatas;</p>
<p class="bas indent2"><span class="nm">2.</span>R. Yehudah holds that it refers to what is Machshir (the Metzora to enter the Mikdash and eat Kodshim), i.e. the Asham;</p>
<p class="bas indent2"><span class="nm">3.</span>R. Eliezer ben Yakov holds that it refers to what causes him to be Tahor (allows him to shave and enter the city), i.e. the birds.</p>

<p class="bas indent1"><span class="nm">(e)</span><span class="cl">Answer (a reciter of Beraisos - Beraisa):</span> "Zos Toras ha'Yoledes la'Zachar Oh la'Nekevah" teaches that she brings one Korban for many births.</p>
