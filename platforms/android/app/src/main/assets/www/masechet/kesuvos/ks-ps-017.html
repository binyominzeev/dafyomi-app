<div class="indent1"><span class="nm">(c)</span><p><span class="cl">Beis Shamai:</span> If she is lame or blind, do we say that she is pretty and has grace?! "Stay far from a false matter"!</p></div>
<div class="indent1"><span class="nm">(d)</span><p><span class="cl">Beis Hillel:</span> Don't you agree that when someone buys something, we praise what he bought?!</p></div>
<div class="indent2"><span class="nm">1.</span><p>From here we learn that a person should always be amiable.</p></div>
<div class="indent1"><span class="nm">(e)</span><p><span class="cl">(Rav Dimi):</span> In Eretz Yisrael, they sing in front of a Kalah 'Without eye-color, rouge or braiding, she bears grace!'</p></div>
<div class="indent1"><span class="nm">(f)</span><p>When R. Zeira was ordained, they sang 'Without eye-color, mascara or braiding, he bears grace!'</p></div>
<div class="indent1"><span class="nm">(g)</span><p>When R. Ami and R. Asi were ordained, they sang 'Like these two we consider ordained, but not Sarmisin (people who mix up Halachos) or Sarmitin (rags);</p></div>
<div class="indent2"><span class="nm">1.</span><p>Some say, they said '...but not Chamisin (those who do not say the reason or only a fifth of it, or only learn a fifth of the Masechta) or Turmisin (empty people).'</p></div>
<div class="indent1"><span class="nm">(h)</span><p>When R. Avahu would come from the Beis Medrash to the Kaiser's house, the maidservant would come out to greet him and sing 'A prince of his people, a leader of his nation, a radiant countenance, blessed is your coming in peace.'</p></div>
<div class="indent1"><span class="nm">(i)</span><p>R. Yehudah used to take a myrtle branch and dance in front of the Kalah, saying 'A pretty, graceful Kalah'.</p></div>
<div class="indent1"><span class="nm">(j)</span><p>Rav Shmuel bar Rav Yitzchak used to juggle three branches.</p></div>
<div class="indent1"><span class="nm">(k)</span><p><span class="cl">R. Zeira:</span> The elder is embarrassing us (he belittles the honor of Chachamim)!</p></div>
<div class="indent1"><span class="nm">(l)</span><p>When Rav Shmuel bar Rav Yitzchak died, a pillar of fire separated him from the people.</p></div>
<div class="indent2"><span class="nm">1.</span><p>We have a tradition - this only happens to one or two people in a generation.</p></div>
<div class="indent1"><span class="nm">(m)</span><p><span class="cl">Version #1 (R. Zeira):</span> The myrtle branch helped him merit this.</p></div>
<div class="indent1"><span class="nm">(n)</span><p><span class="cl">Version #2:</span> His acting like a fool helped him.</p></div>
<div class="indent1"><span class="nm">(o)</span><p><span class="cl">Version #3:</span> His view about how to behave helped him.</p></div>
<div class="indent1"><span class="nm">(p)</span><p>Rav Acha would carry the Kalah on his shoulders and dance.</p></div>
<div class="indent2"><span class="nm">1.</span><p><span class="cl">Rabanan:</span> May we do similarly?</p></div>
<div class="indent2"><span class="nm">2.</span><p><span class="cl">Rav Acha:</span> You may, only if she is like a log to you.</p></div>
<div class="indent1"><span class="nm">(q)</span><p><span class="cl">(R. Shmuel bar Nachmani):</span> One may look at the Kalah all seven days, to endear her to the Chasan.</p></div>
<div class="indent1"><span class="nm">(r)</span><p>The Halachah does not follow him.</p></div>
<div class="subject"><span class="nm">2)</span><p>THE HONOR GIVEN TO THE DECEASED AND TO A KALAH</p></div>
<div class="indent1"><span class="nm">(a)</span><p><span class="cl">(Beraisa):</span> We divert a funeral procession to allow the procession of a Kalah to pass first;</p></div>
<div class="indent1"><span class="nm">(b)</span><p>We divert both of these to allow a Melech Yisrael to pass first.</p></div>
<div class="indent1"><span class="nm">(c)</span><p>King Agripas allowed a Kalah to pass first. Chachamim praised him for this.</p></div>
<div class="indent1"><span class="nm">(d)</span><p><span class="cl">Question:</span> Rav Ashi taught that even the opinion that holds that a Nasi may forego his honor agrees that a king may not!</p></div>
<div class="indent2"><span class="nm">1.</span><p>"Put a king upon you" - his fear should be upon you!</p></div>
<div class="indent1"><span class="nm">(e)</span><p><span class="cl">Answer:</span> There was a fork in the road (so it was not evident that he deferred to the Kalah).</p></div>
<div class="indent1"><span class="nm">(f)</span><p><span class="cl">(Beraisa):</span> We cease learning Torah to escort a Mes or a Kalah. R. Yehudah used to do so.</p></div>
<div class="indent1"><span class="nm">(g)</span><p>If enough people are at the funeral, we remain learning.</p></div>
<div class="indent1"><span class="nm">(h)</span><p><span class="cl">Question:</span> What is considered enough?</p></div>
<div class="indent1"><span class="nm">(i)</span><p><span class="cl">Answer #1 - Version #1 (Rav Shmuel bar Ini):</span> We need 12,000 men and 6,000 Shofar blowers (to announce the funeral).</p></div>
<div class="indent1"><span class="nm">(j)</span><p><span class="cl">Version #2:</span> We need 12,000 men, of whom 6,000 blow Shofaros. (end of Version #2)</p></div>
<div class="indent1"><span class="nm">(k)</span><p><span class="cl">Answer #2 (Ula):</span> We need enough people to reach from the gate of the city to the gravesite.</p></div>
<div class="indent1"><span class="nm">(l)</span><p><span class="cl">Answer #3 (Rav Sheshes):</span> The taking of Torah is like its giving, with 600,000 people.</p></div>
<div class="indent2"><span class="nm">1.</span><p>This applies to one who learned written and oral Torah.</p></div>

<div class="subject"><span class="nm">3)</span><p>CUSTOMS AT THE WEDDINGS OF VIRGINS</p></div>
<div class="indent1"><span class="nm">(a)</span><p><span class="cl">(Mishnah):</span> If witnesses say that she went to Chupah with Hinuma...</p></div>
<div class="indent1"><span class="nm">(b)</span><p><span class="cl">Question:</span> What is Hinuma?</p></div>
<div class="indent1"><span class="nm">(c)</span><p><span class="cl">Answer #1 (Surchav bar Papa):</span> It is a dome of myrtle above her.</p></div>
<div class="indent1"><span class="nm">(d)</span><p><span class="cl">Answer #2 (R. Yochanan):</span> It is a veil in which she dozes.</p></div>
<div class="indent1"><span class="nm">(e)</span><p><span class="cl">(Beraisa):</span> In Yehudah, these customs (cited in the Mishnah) prove that she was a virgin.</p></div>
<div class="indent1"><span class="nm">(f)</span><p><span class="cl">Question:</span> What constitutes a proof in Bavel?</p></div>
<div class="indent1"><span class="nm">(g)</span><p><span class="cl">Answer (Rav):</span> (Women put) oil on the heads of the Chachamim.</p></div>
<div class="indent1"><span class="nm">(h)</span><p><span class="cl">Question (Rav Papa):</span> Do Chachamim have warts, for which they need oil?!</p></div>
<div class="indent1"><span class="nm">(i)</span><p><span class="cl">Answer (Abaye):</span> You are an orphan with respect to this custom! Did your mother never do it for you?!</p></div>
<div class="indent2"><span class="nm">1.</span><p><span class="cl">Version #1:</span> Once, a Chacham married his son into the family of Rabah bar Ula. They anointed the Chachamim's heads with oil.</p></div>
<div class="indent2"><span class="nm">2.</span><p><span class="cl">Version #2:</span> This was done when Rabah bar Ula married his son into the family of a Chacham.</p></div>
<div class="indent1"><span class="nm">(j)</span><p><span class="cl">Question:</span> What is done at the wedding of a non-virgin?</p></div>
<div class="indent1"><span class="nm">(k)</span><p><span class="cl">Answer (Rav Yosef):</span> They do not throw parched grain.</p></div>
<div class="subject"><span class="nm">4)</span><p>ONE WHO CLAIMS THAT HE BOUGHT A FIELD FROM SHIMON'S FATHER</p></div>
<div class="indent1"><span class="nm">(a)</span><p><span class="cl">(Mishnah):</span> R. Yehoshua agrees that if Reuven says to Shimon ('this field belonged to your father and I bought it from him', he is believed).</p></div>
<div class="indent1"><span class="nm">(b)</span><p><span class="cl">Question:</span> (Since this is because 'the ox is not slaughtered in front of you'), why didn't the Tana teach that R. Yehoshua agrees that Reuven is believed to say 'this field was <i>yours</i>, and I bought it from <i>you</i>'?</p></div>
<div class="indent1"><span class="nm">(c)</span><p><span class="cl">Answer:</span> If so, the Seifa would have to say 'if there are witnesses that it used to belong to <i>Shimon</i>, Reuven is not believed.' We cannot teach this if it used to be Shimon's!</p></div>
<div class="indent2"><span class="nm">1.</span><p>If Reuven has a Chazakah on the field (he used it for three years and no one protested, which proves that it is his), he should be believed!</p></div>
<div class="indent2"><span class="nm">2.</span><p>If Reuven has no Chazakah on the field, of course he is not believed!</p></div>
<div class="indent1"><span class="nm">(d)</span><p><span class="cl">Question:</span> The same applies to our Mishnah (when he says 'I bought this field from your father')!</p></div>
<div class="indent2"><span class="nm">1.</span><p>If Reuven has a Chazakah on the field, he should be believed!</p></div>
<div class="indent2"><span class="nm">2.</span><p>If he has no Chazakah on the field, of course he is not believed!</p></div>
<div class="indent1"><span class="nm">(e)</span><p><span class="cl">Answer:</span> Our Mishnah teaches about when Reuven used the field for two years in the life of Shimon's father, and one year after he died and it passed to Shimon (who was a minor. If there are witnesses that it used to belong to Shimon's father, Reuven is not believed.)</p></div>
<div class="indent2"><span class="nm">1.</span><p>This is like Rav Huna, who taught that one cannot make a Chazakah on the field of a child, even after the child grows up.</p></div>
<div class="indent1"><span class="nm">(f)</span><p><span class="cl">Question:</span> Did Rav Huna merely teach the law of our Mishnah?!</p></div>
<div class="indent1"><span class="nm">(g)</span><p><span class="cl">Answer #1:</span> This law is not explicit in the Mishnah, so Rav Huna taught it explicitly.</p></div>
<div class="indent1"><span class="nm">(h)</span><p><span class="cl">Answer #2:</span> His Chidush is that one cannot make a Chazakah, even after the child grows up.</p></div>
<div class="indent1"><span class="nm">(i)</span><p><span class="cl">Question:</span> The Mishnah should teach that Reuven bought the field from Shimon, and used the field two years in Shimon's presence, and one year when Shimon was away, e.g. he fled!</p></div>
<div class="indent1"><span class="nm">(j)</span><p><span class="cl">Answer:</span> No matter why he fled, there is no Chidush!</p></div>
<div class="indent2"><span class="nm">1.</span><p>If he feared for his life, obviously Reuven is not believed! (Since Shimon was afraid to protest, uncontested use of the field is not a Chazakah.)</p></div>
<div class="indent2"><span class="nm">2.</span><p>If he fled for monetary concerns, he should have protested! We hold that a protest not in front of the Machazik (the one who claims that he bought it) is a good protest. (Shimon has a Chazakah, so obviously, he is believed!)</p></div>
<div class="indent3"><span class="nm">i.</span><p><span class="cl">(Mishnah):</span> There are three regions in Eretz Yisrael regarding Chazakah: Yehudah, the other (east) side of the Jordan River, and Galil. A Chazakah is valid only if the Machazik was in the same region.</p></div>
<div class="indent3"><span class="nm">ii.</span><p><span class="cl">Question:</span> If the Tana does not require a protest to be in front of the Machazik, a Chazakah should be valid even if they are in different regions! If he requires a protest to be in front of the Machazik, even if the Machazik is in the same region, it should not be a Chazakah if he is in a different city!</p></div>
<div class="indent3"><span class="nm">iii.</span><p><span class="cl">Answer (R. Aba bar Mamal):</span> (Normally) he does not require a protest to be in front of the Machazik. The Mishnah discusses when there is a Cherem (people are not allowed to travel from one region to the other, so word does not spread).</p></div>
<div class="indent3"><span class="nm">iv.</span><p><span class="cl">Question:</span> If so, why does the Mishnah discuss Yehudah and Galil? (It should discuss regions with a Cherem between them!)</p></div>
<div class="indent3"><span class="nm">v.</span><p><span class="cl">Answer:</span> Our Mishnah teaches that we assume that there is a Cherem between Yehudah and Galil.</p></div>
