<div class="indent1"><span class="nm">(a)</span><p>From the Pasuk in Zecharyah (14:8) we learn the increasing strength of that water.</p></div>
<div class="indent2"><span class="nm">1.</span><p>It originates as a trickle in the Kodshei Kodoshim.</p></div>
<div class="indent2"><span class="nm">2.</span><p>It will increment to a rushing river.</p></div>
<div class="indent1"><span class="nm">(b)</span><p>The Pesukim in Yechezkel (47:1-5) give another description of the waters flowing from the Mikdash.</p></div>
<div class="indent2"><span class="nm">1.</span><p>The Pasuk indicates the flow at each thousand-Amah distance.</p></div>
<div class="indent2"><span class="nm">2.</span><p>The Pasuk in Yeshaya (25:11) defines "Sachu" as "Shayit" (boating).</p></div>
<div class="indent2"><span class="nm">3.</span><p>Alternately Sachu refers to waters which are spoken about (Sichah).</p></div>
<div class="indent1"><span class="nm">(c)</span><p>The Pasuk the Zecharyah (13:1) speaks of the water which will go out for the house of Dovid and the residents of Yerushalayim for Chatas (Parah Adumah) and Nidah (Mikveh).</p></div>
<div class="indent2"><span class="nm">1.</span><p><span class="cl">Question:</span> Could not the rest of the people use these waters?</p></div>
<div class="indent2"><span class="nm">2.</span><p><span class="cl">Answer #1:</span> The waters from Beis Dovid until the residences of Yerushalayim will be Kosher for Nidah and Chatas; from there out only for Nidah.</p></div>
<div class="indent2"><span class="nm">3.</span><p><span class="cl">Answer #2:</span> For that first distance they are Kosher for everything; from there out they do not gather.</p></div>
<div class="indent1"><span class="nm">(d)</span><p>The Pasuk in Yechezkel (47:8) speaks of these waters.</p></div>
<div class="indent2"><span class="nm">1.</span><p>They will join the water bodies of Israel.</p></div>
<div class="indent2"><span class="nm">2.</span><p>Mutzaim means the waters went out twice (during the generations of Enosh and the Palagah, to different distances, as the opinions indicate).</p></div>
<div class="indent2"><span class="nm">3.</span><p>The last opinion is derived from the Pasuk in Iyov (38:11) "Ad Poh Savoh v'Lo Sosif u'Fo Yashis b'Geon Galechah."</p></div>
<div class="indent3"><span class="nm">i.</span><p>Poh refers to Ako.</p></div>
<div class="indent3"><span class="nm">ii.</span><p>u'Fo refers to Yafo.</p></div>
<div class="indent1"><span class="nm">(e)</span><p><span class="cl">Question:</span> Why do the waters need to meet the Sea of Teveryah and the Sea of Sibuchah (sweet-water bodies).</p></div>
<div class="indent1"><span class="nm">(f)</span><p><span class="cl">Answer:</span> The waters add to their fish, and to the species of fish in them (as indicated by the incident of R. Shimon b. Gamliel).</p></div>
<div class="indent1"><span class="nm">(g)</span><p><span class="cl">Question:</span> The Pasuk (Yechezkel 47:11) indicates the waters will become sweet, while Pasuk 8 indicates they will not!?</p></div>
<div class="indent1"><span class="nm">(h)</span><p><span class="cl">Answer:</span> The latter is a place name.</p></div>
<div class="indent1"><span class="nm">(i)</span><p>The words "la'Chadashav Yivaker" in Pasuk 12 speak of the ripening of the fruit.</p></div>
<div class="indent2"><span class="nm">1.</span><p>As we know it, grain ripens in six months, while fruit trees produce their fruit in 12 months.</p></div>
<div class="indent2"><span class="nm">2.</span><p>In the future the grain will ripen in a month; fruit in two.</p></div>
<div class="indent2"><span class="nm">3.</span><p>Based on Yoel (2:23) the grain in 15 days; the fruit in a month.</p></div>
<div class="indent2"><span class="nm">4.</span><p><span class="cl">Question:</span> But la'Chadashav is in the plural?!</p></div>
<div class="indent2"><span class="nm">5.</span><p><span class="cl">Answer:</span> The plural refers to <i>every</i> month.</p></div>
<div class="indent1"><span class="nm">(j)</span><p>The words "v'Aleyhu li'Serufah" speak of the leaves of the fruit trees growing from the springs of the Mikdash.</p></div>

<div class="indent2"><span class="nm">2.</span><p>Its medicinal value is to release the "mouth."</p></div>

<div class="indent1"><span class="nm">(a)</span><p><span class="cl">Question:</span> The Beraisa says that the Lechem was on silver, while our Mishnah says marble!?</p></div>
<div class="indent1"><span class="nm">(b)</span><p><span class="cl">Answer:</span> Our Mishnah holds they were not of silver since it generates heat (causing spoilage to the Lechem).</p></div>
<div class="indent1"><span class="nm">(c)</span><p><span class="cl">Question:</span> But the warm freshness of the bread all week was miraculous!?</p></div>
<div class="indent1"><span class="nm">(d)</span><p><span class="cl">Answer:</span> We do not discuss (rely on) the miracles.</p></div>
<div class="indent1"><span class="nm">(e)</span><p>The Beraisa holds silver, and not marble because the latter introduces cold (and the Lechem needed to be warm).</p></div>

<div class="indent1"><span class="nm">(c)</span><p><span class="cl">Answer:</span> They were not in a row, rather five to the right of Moshe's Shulchan and five to the left.</p></div>
<div class="indent2"><span class="nm">1.</span><p>Only the Shulchan of Moshe was set with Lechem (based on Melachim I 7:48).</p></div>
