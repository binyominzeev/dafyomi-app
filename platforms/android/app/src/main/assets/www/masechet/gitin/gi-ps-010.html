<p class="bas subject"><span class="nm">1)</span>WHAT IS UNIQUE TO <i>GITEI</i> <i>NASHIM</i> AND OF FREEDOM</p>
<p class="bas indent1"><span class="nm">(a)</span><span class="cl">Answer:</span> They all hold like R. Elazar regarding which witnesses empower a Get. They argue about a Get in which the witnesses have names that Yisre'elim are never called by. (The first Tana disqualifies it, lest the husband use the witnesses signed for Edei Mesirah.)</p>
<p class="bas indent1"><span class="nm">(b)</span><span class="cl">Question:</span> Canceling Shelichus to give a Get disqualifies mid'Oraisa, yet it was taught (in the Beraisa and Mishnayos, according to R. Meir)!</p>
<p class="bas indent1"><span class="nm">(c)</span><span class="cl">Retraction:</span> Rather, we count only laws that do not apply to documents of Kidushin.</p>
<p class="bas indent1"><span class="nm">(d)</span><span class="cl">Question:</span> Canceling Shelichus applies to Kidushin, yet it was taught!</p>
<p class="bas indent1"><span class="nm">(e)</span><span class="cl">Answer:</span> Kidushin is different, for the Shali'ach cannot give the document against her will. One can give a Get of divorce or freedom against the will of the wife or slave.</p>
<p class="bas subject"><span class="nm">2)</span><i>KUSI</i> WITNESSES</p>
<p class="bas indent1"><span class="nm">(a)</span><span class="cl">(Mishnah):</span> Any Get with a Kusi witness on it is Pasul, except for a Get of divorce or freedom;</p>
<p class="bas indent2"><span class="nm">1.</span>A case occurred in which the witnesses on a Get were Kusim, and R. Gamliel ruled that it is Kosher.</p>
<p class="bas indent1"><span class="nm">(b)</span><span class="cl">(Gemara) Question:</span> Our Mishnah is unlike all the Tana'im of the following Beraisa!</p>
<p class="bas indent2"><span class="nm">1.</span><span class="cl">(Beraisa):</span> Matzah of Kusim is permitted. One who eats it on Seder night fulfills the Mitzvah;</p>
<p class="bas indent2"><span class="nm">2.</span>R. Elazer forbids it, because they are not careful about the details of Mitzvos;</p>
<p class="bas indent2"><span class="nm">3.</span>R. Shimon ben Gamliel says, Kusim are established to keep some Mitzvos, and they keep those Mitzvos more meticulously than Yisrael.</p>
<p class="bas indent2"><span class="nm">4.</span>Our Mishnah is unlike the first Tana, for he would accept all documents with Kusi witnesses!</p>
<p class="bas indent2"><span class="nm">5.</span>Our Mishnah is unlike R. Elazar, for he would disqualify even a Get of divorce with a Kusi witness!</p>
<p class="bas indent2"><span class="nm">6.</span>It is unlike R. Shimon ben Gamliel, for he would not distinguish between Gitei Nashim and other documents:</p>
<p class="bas indent3"><span class="nm">i.</span>If Kusim are established not to bear false testimony, they should be valid for both;</p>
<p class="bas indent3"><span class="nm">ii.</span>If Kusim are suspected to bear false testimony, they should be Pasul for both!</p>
<p class="bas indent2"><span class="nm">7.</span><span class="cl">Suggestion:</span> Perhaps Kusim are established not to bear false testimony regarding divorce, but are suspected regarding other documents.</p>
<p class="bas indent2"><span class="nm">8.</span><span class="cl">Rejection:</span> If so, even two Kusim signed on a Get should be valid!</p>
<p class="bas indent3"><span class="nm">i.</span><span class="cl">(R. Elazar):</span> The Mishnah accepts only a Get with one Kusi signed on it. (This is R. Elazar ben Pedas, an Amora. It is not the Tana in the Beraisa, R. Elazar ben Shamu'a.)</p>
<p class="bas indent1"><span class="nm">(c)</span><span class="cl">Answer:</span> Really, the Mishnah is like R. Elazar. The case is, a Yisrael signed underneath the Kusi.</p>
<p class="bas bbbline">10b----------------------------------------10b</p>
<p class="bas indent2"><span class="nm">1.</span>A Yisrael would let a Kusi sign before him only if he knew that the Kusi is reliable.</p>
<p class="bas indent1"><span class="nm">(d)</span><span class="cl">Question:</span> If so, if one Kusi signed (first) on other documents this should also be valid!</p>
<p class="bas indent1"><span class="nm">(e)</span><span class="cl">Answer:</span> We must say that we are concerned lest the Kusi is unreliable. The Yisrael signed before the Kusi signed;</p>
<p class="bas indent2"><span class="nm">1.</span>The Yisrael expected someone more important than himself to be the other witness, therefore he signed at the bottom (to show deference).</p>
<p class="bas indent1"><span class="nm">(f)</span><span class="cl">Question:</span> Here also, we should be concerned lest the Yisrael signed first (at the bottom), expecting someone more important than himself to be the other witness!</p>
<p class="bas indent1"><span class="nm">(g)</span><span class="cl">Answer (Rav Papa):</span> Since we have no such concern, this shows that witnesses on a Get must sign in front of each other.</p>
<p class="bas indent1"><span class="nm">(h)</span><span class="cl">Question:</span> What is the reason?</p>
<p class="bas indent1"><span class="nm">(i)</span><span class="cl">Answer (Rav Ashi):</span> It is a decree due to the case when the husband says 'all of you should sign this Get.' (If two, but not all, sign, the Get will appear to be valid, but really, it is Pasul!)</p>
<p class="bas indent1"><span class="nm">(j)</span><span class="cl">(R. Elazar):</span> The Mishnah accepts only a Get with one Kusi signed on it.</p>
<p class="bas indent1"><span class="nm">(k)</span><span class="cl">Question:</span> Why must he teach this? It is clear from the Mishnah! It says, any Get that has one Kusi like a witness is Pasul (except for a Get of divorce or freedom)!</p>
<p class="bas indent1"><span class="nm">(l)</span><span class="cl">Answer:</span> One might have thought that a Get of divorce or freedom is valid even if both witnesses are Kusim, and the Mishnah discusses one Kusi witness, for this disqualifies other documents.</p>
<p class="bas indent1"><span class="nm">(m)</span><span class="cl">Question:</span> Two Kusim on a Get do not disqualify it!</p>
<p class="bas indent2"><span class="nm">1.</span><span class="cl">(Mishnah):</span> A case occurred in which the witnesses on a Get were Kusim, and R. Gamliel ruled that it is Kosher.</p>
<p class="bas indent1"><span class="nm">(n)</span><span class="cl">Answer #1 (Abaye):</span> The Mishnah should say "its witness" was a Kusi.</p>
<p class="bas indent1"><span class="nm">(o)</span><span class="cl">Answer #2 (Rava):</span> Really, R. Gamliel allows even two Kusim. He argues with the first Tana.</p>
<p class="bas indent2"><span class="nm">1.</span><span class="cl">The Mishnah is abbreviated; it means as follows:</span> R. Gamliel allows even both witnesses to be Kusim. A case occurred in which the witnesses on a Get were Kusim, and R. Gamliel ruled that it is Kosher.</p>
<p class="bas subject"><span class="nm">3)</span>DOCUMENTS OF COURTS OF <i>NOCHRIM</i></p>
<p class="bas indent1"><span class="nm">(a)</span><span class="cl">(Mishnah):</span> All documents written by Nochri courts, even though Nochrim signed them, are valid, except for Gitei Nashim or freedom;</p>
<p class="bas indent1"><span class="nm">(b)</span>R. Shimon says, even these are valid; they are only Pasul when done by commoners.</p>
<p class="bas indent1"><span class="nm">(c)</span><span class="cl">(Gemara):</span> The Mishnah does not distinguish between documents of sale and gift.</p>
<p class="bas indent1"><span class="nm">(d)</span>We understand why documents of sale are valid - the giving of the money made the acquisition, the document is merely a proof.</p>
<p class="bas indent2"><span class="nm">1.</span>The judges would not write a document if the money was not given, for this would damage their reputation.</p>
<p class="bas indent1"><span class="nm">(e)</span><span class="cl">Question:</span> Why is a document of a gift valid? (If Nochri courts made it,) it has no power to transfer property!</p>
<p class="bas indent1"><span class="nm">(f)</span><span class="cl">Answer #1 (Shmuel):</span> The law of the kingdom (that court documents transfer property) is binding.</p>
<p class="bas indent1"><span class="nm">(g)</span><span class="cl">Answer #2:</span> The Mishnah should say 'except for documents like Gitei Nashim (i.e. that are not merely proofs, but change ownership or status).</p>
<p class="bas indent1"><span class="nm">(h)</span><span class="cl">(Mishnah - R. Shimon):</span> Even these are Kosher...</p>
<p class="bas indent1"><span class="nm">(i)</span><span class="cl">Question:</span> Nochrim have nothing to do with divorce. Their Gitin have no effect!</p>
<p class="bas indent1"><span class="nm">(j)</span><span class="cl">Answer (R. Zeira):</span> R. Shimon holds like R. Elazar, that Edei Mesirah Karsei.</p>
<p class="bas indent1"><span class="nm">(k)</span><span class="cl">Question:</span> R. Aba taught that R. Elazar admits that an intrinsic forgery (a Get in which the testimony of the signed witnesses is Pasul) is Pasul. Here, the judges are Pasul witnesses!</p>
<p class="bas indent1"><span class="nm">(l)</span><span class="cl">Answer:</span> The case is, it is clear from the judges' names that they are Nochrim. (No one would rely on them for witnesses of divorce.)</p>
