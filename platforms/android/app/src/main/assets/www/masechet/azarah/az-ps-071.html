<p class="bas subject"><span class="nm">1)</span>FOR WHAT DO SOLDIERS HAVE TIME?</p>
<p class="bas indent1"><span class="nm">(a)</span><span class="cl">(Gemara) Contradiction (Mishnah):</span> If an army besieging a city conquered the city, all wives of Kohanim are forbidden to their husbands (lest they were raped).</p>
<p class="bas indent1"><span class="nm">(b)</span><span class="cl">Answer (Rav Mari):</span> Soldiers do not have time to be Menasech, but they find time to rape (because they have a greater desire for this).</p>
<p class="bas subject"><span class="nm">2)</span>A 'NOCHRI' PAYING THE TAXES OF A YISRAEL</p>
<p class="bas indent1"><span class="nm">(a)</span><span class="cl">(Mishnah):</span> If Yisraelim worked for a Nochri and he sent them Yayin Nesech in lieu of wages, they may ask for its value instead;</p>
<p class="bas indent1"><span class="nm">(b)</span>Once they accepted the wine, it is forbidden (they may not ask for anything in place of it).</p>
<p class="bas indent1"><span class="nm">(c)</span><span class="cl">Version #1 - Rashi - (Gemara - Rav Yehudah citing Rav):</span> Reuven may tell a Nochri 'take care of my obligation to pay the king's tithe (on Peros)' (even if the Nochri will give Yayin Nesech and Reuven will compensate him).</p>
<p class="bas indent1"><span class="nm">(d)</span><span class="cl">Version #2 - Rambam - (Rav Yehudah citing Rav):</span> Reuven may tell a Nochri 'take care of Manas ha'Melech (the king forces people to buy his extra wine) for me' (the Nochri buys Yayin Nesech, and Reuven compensates him). (end of Version #2)</p>
<p class="bas indent1"><span class="nm">(e)</span><span class="cl">Question (Beraisa):</span> Reuven may not tell a Nochri 'go in my place to (pay) the king's officer.' (Rashi - the Nochri is Reuven's Shali'ach. It is as if Reuven pays his debt with Yayin Nesech. Rambam - it is as if Reuven sells the Yayin Nesech (which he must buy) to the Nochri.)</p>
<p class="bas indent1"><span class="nm">(f)</span><span class="cl">Answer (Rav):</span> My case is different. It resembles the Seifa of the Beraisa;</p>
<p class="bas indent2"><span class="nm">1.</span><span class="cl">(Seifa):</span> Reuven may tell a Nochri 'save me from the king's officer' (Rashi - the Nochri has many ways to appease him, he is not Reuven's Shali'ach to give Yayin Nesech; Tosfos - Reuven suggests appeasing him with anything, therefore it is permitted, even if the official insists on wine; Rambam - the Nochri buys the wine for himself).</p>
<p class="bas subject"><span class="nm">3)</span>SELLING WINE TO A 'NOCHRI'</p>
<p class="bas indent1"><span class="nm">(a)</span><span class="cl">(Mishnah):</span> If a Yisrael sells wine to a Nochri:</p>
<p class="bas indent2"><span class="nm">1.</span>If he was Posek (fixed the price) before he measured out the wine, the money is permitted;</p>
<p class="bas indent2"><span class="nm">2.</span>If he measured out the wine before he was Posek, the money is forbidden (it is given for Yayin Nesech).</p>
<p class="bas indent1"><span class="nm">(b)</span><span class="cl">(Gemara - Ameimar):</span> A Nochri does acquire through Meshichah.</p>
<p class="bas indent1"><span class="nm">(c)</span><span class="cl">Version #1 - Support:</span> Persians send gifts to each other, and they do not retract.</p>
<p class="bas indent1"><span class="nm">(d)</span><span class="cl">Version #2 - Support:</span> Persian grain sellers send samples to prospective buyers. If the buyer wants to keep (buy) the sample, the seller allows him to, even though money was not given yet. (end of Version #2)</p>
<p class="bas indent1"><span class="nm">(e)</span><span class="cl">Rejection (Rav Ashi):</span> Really, Nochrim do not acquire through Meshichah;</p>
<p class="bas indent2"><span class="nm">1.</span>They do not retract because they are haughty.</p>
<p class="bas indent1"><span class="nm">(f)</span><span class="cl">Support (Rav Ashi, for himself):</span> I learn from Rav.</p>
<p class="bas indent2"><span class="nm">1.</span><span class="cl">Rav (to Yisrael wine sellers):</span> When you sell to Nochrim, take the money before you measure out the wine;</p>
<p class="bas indent3"><span class="nm">i.</span>If the buyers do not have money, lend to them the money, and take the money before you measure out the wine, and later collect the loan.</p>
<p class="bas indent3"><span class="nm">ii.</span>If you will not do so, your wine will become Yayin Nesech while it still belongs to you. One may not take money for Yayin Nesech.</p>
<p class="bas indent2"><span class="nm">2.</span><span class="cl">(Rav Ashi):</span> If you will say that a Nochri acquires through Meshichah, he acquires when it is measured, it is not yet Yayin Nesech (until he touches it)!</p>
<p class="bas bbbline">71b----------------------------------------71b</p>
<p class="bas indent1"><span class="nm">(g)</span><span class="cl">Rejection:</span> If the Yisraelim would measure the wine into their own Kelim, this would be a good support;</p>
<p class="bas indent2"><span class="nm">1.</span>However, the Yisraelim measure into Kelim of Nochrim. The wine becomes Yayin Nesech once it enters the Kelim (and mixes with residues of Yayin Nesech).</p>
<p class="bas indent1"><span class="nm">(h)</span><span class="cl">Defense (of Rav Ashi):</span> If Nochrim acquire through Meshichah, he would acquire once the wine enters the airspace of his Keli, it is not Yayin Nesech until it reaches the bottom (and mixes with residues of Yayin Nesech)!</p>
<p class="bas indent1"><span class="nm">(i)</span><span class="cl">Inference:</span> The opinion that rejected Rav Ashi's support holds that Nitzok (a liquid flowing through the air) is considered connected (therefore, the entire stream of wine is Yayin Nesech, even what is above the Keli).</p>
<p class="bas indent1"><span class="nm">(j)</span><span class="cl">Rejection:</span> If the Nochri were holding his Keli in his hands, this would be a valid inference;</p>
<p class="bas indent2"><span class="nm">1.</span>However, the case is, the Keli rests on the ground. (Therefore, he does not acquire until he picks it up (after it is full). It is already Yayin Nesech).</p>
<p class="bas indent1"><span class="nm">(k)</span><span class="cl">Question:</span> Why doesn't the Nochri's Keli acquire for him?</p>
<p class="bas indent2"><span class="nm">1.</span><span class="cl">Inference:</span> We must say that the buyer's Kelim do not acquire in the owner's premises!</p>
<p class="bas indent1"><span class="nm">(l)</span><span class="cl">Answer (and Rejection):</span> No, perhaps they do acquire;</p>
<p class="bas indent2"><span class="nm">1.</span>The case is, a drop of the Nochri's wine remained on the lip of his Keli. The Yisrael's wine mixes with this and becomes forbidden before it enters the Keli itself.</p>
<p class="bas indent1"><span class="nm">(m)</span><span class="cl">Question:</span> This is not like R. Shimon ben Gamliel, who says that (if Kosher wine was mixed with Yayin Nesech) one may sell the mixture, but he may take money only for the (amount of) Kosher wine. (The Halachah follows R. Shimon ben Gamliel!)</p>
<p class="bas indent1"><span class="nm">(n)</span><span class="cl">Answer:</span> We are explaining Rav. Rav says that the Halachah follows R. Shimon ben Gamliel only when barrels of Kosher wine were mixed with barrels of Yayin Nesech, but not if the wine itself mixed (for then all the wine absorbs the Yayin Nesech).</p>
<p class="bas subject"><span class="nm">4)</span>DO 'NOCHRIM' ACQUIRE THROUGH <i>MESHICHAH?</i></p>
<p class="bas indent1"><span class="nm">(a)</span><span class="cl">Question (against Ameimar - Beraisa):</span> If a Yisrael bought scrap metal from a Nochri, and found idolatry among it:</p>
<p class="bas indent2"><span class="nm">1.</span>If he did Meshichah but did not yet give the money, he can return it (it was a mistaken sale);</p>
<p class="bas indent2"><span class="nm">2.</span>If he did Meshichah after giving the money, he must cast the idolatry to the Dead Sea.</p>
<p class="bas indent2"><span class="nm">3.</span>If Nochrim acquire through Meshichah (and Yisraelim acquire from them with Meshichah), why may he return the idolatry (in the Reisha)? He acquired it (and owes its value. By returning it, he sells it back or pays his debt with it)!</p>
<p class="bas indent1"><span class="nm">(b)</span><span class="cl">Answer #1 (Abaye):</span> In the Reisha it is a mistaken sale (he never intended to buy idolatry. He never acquired it. This is the text in Bechoros. Rava's response shows also here it is the correct text - Toras Chayim.)</p>
<p class="bas indent1"><span class="nm">(c)</span><span class="cl">Objection (Rava):</span> Also in the Seifa, it is a mistaken sale. There he may not return it!</p>
<p class="bas indent1"><span class="nm">(d)</span><span class="cl">Answer #2 (Rava):</span> In both clauses it is a mistaken sale;</p>
<p class="bas indent2"><span class="nm">1.</span>In the Reisha, he did not give money, so it looks like a mistaken sale;</p>
<p class="bas indent2"><span class="nm">2.</span>In the Seifa, he gave money, so it <i>looks like</i> he bought it. He may not return it due to Mar'is Ayin.</p>
<p class="bas indent1"><span class="nm">(e)</span><span class="cl">Question (against Rav Ashi - Mar Kashisha brei d'Rav Chisda - Mishnah):</span> If a Yisrael sells wine to a Nochri:</p>
<p class="bas indent2"><span class="nm">1.</span>If he Pasak before measuring out the wine, the money is permitted;</p>
<p class="bas indent2"><span class="nm">2.</span>If Meshichah does not acquire (for a Nochri), the money should be forbidden (it becomes Yayin Nesech while it still belongs to the Yisrael)!</p>
<p class="bas indent1"><span class="nm">(f)</span><span class="cl">Answer (Rav Ashi):</span> The case is, the Nochri gave (more than enough) money for the wine beforehand (his money acquires for him before it becomes Yayin Nesech).</p>
<p class="bas indent1"><span class="nm">(g)</span><span class="cl">Question (Mar Kashisha brei d'Rav Chisda):</span> If so, also in the Seifa (he measured out the wine before he Pasak) the money should be permitted!</p>
<p class="bas indent2"><span class="nm">1.</span><span class="cl">Counter-question (Rav Ashi):</span> You say that Meshichah acquires. Why is the law different in the two clauses?</p>
<p class="bas indent2"><span class="nm">2.</span><span class="cl">Answer (Rav Ashi):</span> You must say that before Pesikah, he is not sure he wants to buy, so he does not acquire;</p>
<p class="bas indent1"><span class="nm">(h)</span><span class="cl">Answer (Rav Ashi):</span> Also I explain the difference between the clauses in this way!</p>
<p class="bas indent1"><span class="nm">(i)</span><span class="cl">Question (against Rav Ashi - Ravina - R. Chiya bar Aba):</span> A Ben Noach is killed for stealing less than a Perutah (from a Yisrael). He need not return it (because a Yisrael pardons such a small amount).</p>
<p class="bas indent2"><span class="nm">1.</span>If he does not acquire with Meshichah, why is he killed? (What he stole is not considered money, and he did not even acquire it!)</p>
<p class="bas indent1"><span class="nm">(j)</span><span class="cl">Answer (Rav Ashi):</span> He is killed because he pained a Yisrael.</p>
<p class="bas indent1"><span class="nm">(k)</span><span class="cl">Version #1 - Rashi - Question:</span> 'He need not <i>return</i> it' implies that he acquired it!</p>
<p class="bas indent1"><span class="nm">(l)</span><span class="cl">Answer:</span> It means that he <i>cannot</i> return it, i.e. he did not acquire it.</p>
<p class="bas indent1"><span class="nm">(m)</span><span class="cl">Version #2 - Tosfos - Question:</span> If (it is not considered theft, rather) he is killed for paining a Yisrael, obviously he need not return it! (Why did R. Chiya need to teach this?)</p>
<p class="bas indent1"><span class="nm">(n)</span><span class="cl">Answer:</span> Indeed, this comes to teach that it is not considered theft. (end of Version #2)</p>
