<p class="bas subject"><span class="nm">1)</span>CAN A MARRIED WOMAN SELL HER PROPERTY?</p>
<p class="bas indent1"><span class="nm">(a)</span><span class="cl">(Mishnah):</span> Beis Shamai and Beis Hillel agree that an Arusah may sell or give for a gift property that fell to her before Kidushin.</p>
<p class="bas indent1"><span class="nm">(b)</span>Beis Shamai say, even if it fell after Kidushin, she may sell;</p>
<p class="bas indent1"><span class="nm">(c)</span>Beis Hillel say, she may not sell.</p>
<p class="bas indent1"><span class="nm">(d)</span>They agree that if she sold or gave it, the sale or gift stands.</p>
<p class="bas indent1"><span class="nm">(e)</span><span class="cl">R. Yehudah:</span> Chachamim said in front of R. Gamliel 'Since her husband acquires her, he should acquire the property!'</p>
<p class="bas indent2"><span class="nm">1.</span><span class="cl">R. Gamliel (to Chachamim):</span> We are embarrassed about the new property (we say that if she sold after Nisu'in, the husband takes it from the buyers). Do you suggest to say the same about the old property?!</p>
<p class="bas indent1"><span class="nm">(f)</span>Beis Shamai and Beis Hillel agree that if property fell to her after Nisu'in, if she sold it the husband takes it from the buyers.</p>
<p class="bas indent1"><span class="nm">(g)</span>R. Gamliel says, if property fell to her before Nisu'in, and she sold or gave it after Nisu'in, it stands.</p>
<p class="bas indent1"><span class="nm">(h)</span><span class="cl">R. Chanina ben Akavya:</span> Chachamim said in front of R. Gamliel: Since the husband acquires the woman, doesn't he acquire the property?!</p>
<p class="bas indent2"><span class="nm">1.</span><span class="cl">R. Gamliel:</span> We are embarrassed about the new property. Do you suggest this about the old property?!</p>
<p class="bas indent1"><span class="nm">(i)</span>R. Shimon distinguishes between different types of property:</p>
<p class="bas indent2"><span class="nm">1.</span>If the husband knew about it, she may not sell it. If she did, the sale or gift is void;</p>
<p class="bas indent2"><span class="nm">2.</span>If the husband did not know about it, she may not sell it. If she did, the sale or gift stands.</p>
<p class="bas indent1"><span class="nm">(j)</span><span class="cl">(Gemara) Question:</span> Why do they agree in the Reisha (property that fell before Kidushin), and argue in the Seifa (when it fell after Kidushin)?</p>
<p class="bas indent1"><span class="nm">(k)</span><span class="cl">Answer #1 (d'Vei R. Yanai):</span> In the Reisha, the property falls to her. In the Seifa, it falls to him (due to his rights in her property).</p>
<p class="bas indent1"><span class="nm">(l)</span><span class="cl">Objection:</span> If it falls to him, if she sold it the sale would not stand!</p>
<p class="bas indent1"><span class="nm">(m)</span><span class="cl">Answer #2:</span> Rather, in the Reisha, the property falls to her. In the Seifa, it is a Safek whether it falls to her or to him (Eirusin is like Safek Nisu'in);</p>
<p class="bas indent2"><span class="nm">1.</span>L'Chatchilah, she should not sell. If she sold or gave it, it stands.</p>
<p class="bas subject"><span class="nm">2)</span>THOSE WHO DISAGREE WITH R. GAMLIEL</p>
<p class="bas indent1"><span class="nm">(a)</span><span class="cl">(Mishnah - R. Yehudah):</span> Chachamim said to R. Gamliel... (he should acquire the property)!</p>
<p class="bas indent1"><span class="nm">(b)</span><span class="cl">Question:</span> Does R. Yehudah challenge Beis Shamai's opinion that she may sell, or Beis Hillel's opinion that her sale stands?</p>
<p class="bas bbbline">78b----------------------------------------78b</p>
<p class="bas indent1"><span class="nm">(c)</span><span class="cl">Answer (Beraisa - R. Yehudah):</span> Chachamim said in front of R. Gamliel: A Nesu'ah is his wife and also an Arusah is his wife. Just like a Nesu'ah's sale is void, also an Arusah's sale is void!</p>
<p class="bas indent2"><span class="nm">1.</span>This shows that he holds that even b'Di'eved, the sale is void.</p>
<p class="bas indent1"><span class="nm">(d)</span><span class="cl">(Beraisa - R. Chanina ben Akavya):</span> R. Gamliel did not answer that way, rather like this:</p>
<p class="bas indent2"><span class="nm">1.</span><span class="cl">R. Gamliel:</span> No. A Nesu'ah's sale is void, since he receives her Metzi'os and earnings and he can annul her vows alone. We do not say so about an Arusah, in whom he lacks these privileges!</p>
<p class="bas indent2"><span class="nm">2.</span><span class="cl">Chachamim:</span> That explains if she sold before Nisu'in. What if she sold after Nisu'in?</p>
<p class="bas indent2"><span class="nm">3.</span><span class="cl">R. Gamliel:</span> Also then she may sell or give, and it stands.</p>
<p class="bas indent2"><span class="nm">4.</span><span class="cl">Chachamim:</span> Since he acquires the woman, he should acquire the property!</p>
<p class="bas indent2"><span class="nm">5.</span><span class="cl">R. Gamliel:</span> We are embarrassed about the new property. Do you suggest this about the old property?!</p>
<p class="bas indent1"><span class="nm">(e)</span>Contradiction (Mishnah - R. Gamliel) After Nisu'in, if she sold...(but she may not sell l'Chatchilah)!</p>
<p class="bas indent1"><span class="nm">(f)</span><span class="cl">Answer #1 (Rav Zvid):</span> The Mishnah should say 'she may sell.'</p>
<p class="bas indent1"><span class="nm">(g)</span><span class="cl">Answer #2 (Rav Papa):</span> The Mishnah is how R. Yehudah understood R. Gamliel. The Beraisa is how R. Chanina understood him.</p>
<p class="bas indent1"><span class="nm">(h)</span><span class="cl">Question:</span> Does R. Chanina hold (that R. Gamliel holds) like Beis Shamai?!</p>
<p class="bas indent1"><span class="nm">(i)</span><span class="cl">Answer:</span> No. He says that Beis Hillel agree with Beis Shamai (that she may sell l'Chatchilah).</p>
<p class="bas subject"><span class="nm">3)</span>WHEN THE HUSBAND CAN RECLAIM THE PROPERTY</p>
<p class="bas indent1"><span class="nm">(a)</span><span class="cl">(Rav and Shmuel):</span> Whether the property fell before Kidushin or during Eirusin, (if she sold) after Nisu'in, the husband takes the property from the buyers.</p>
<p class="bas indent1"><span class="nm">(b)</span><span class="cl">Question:</span> Who is this like? It is not like R. Yehudah, nor like R. Chanina!</p>
<p class="bas indent1"><span class="nm">(c)</span><span class="cl">Answer:</span> It is like Raboseinu;</p>
<p class="bas indent2"><span class="nm">1.</span><span class="cl">(Beraisa):</span> Raboseinu reconsidered, voted and concluded that whether the property fell before Kidushin or during Eirusin, (if she sold) after Nisu'in, the husband takes the property from the buyers.</p>
<p class="bas indent1"><span class="nm">(d)</span><span class="cl">(Mishnah):</span> After Nisu'in, they agree...</p>
<p class="bas indent1"><span class="nm">(e)</span><span class="cl">Suggestion:</span> The enactment of Usha is taught in our Mishnah!</p>
<p class="bas indent2"><span class="nm">1.</span><span class="cl">(R. Yosi bar Chanina):</span> In Usha they enacted that if a woman sold her Melug property in the life of her husband and she died, he takes the property from the buyers.</p>
<p class="bas indent1"><span class="nm">(f)</span><span class="cl">Rejection:</span> No. Our Mishnah teaches that he may take the property from the buyers in her lifetime to eat the Peiros. The enactment of Usha applies to the land itself, after she dies.</p>
<p class="bas indent1"><span class="nm">(g)</span><span class="cl">(Mishnah):</span> R. Shimon distinguishes between different types of property...</p>
<p class="bas indent1"><span class="nm">(h)</span><span class="cl">Question:</span> What is called known property, and what is unknown?</p>
<p class="bas indent1"><span class="nm">(i)</span><span class="cl">Answer #1 (R. Yosi bar Chanina):</span> Land is known; Metaltelim are unknown.</p>
<p class="bas indent1"><span class="nm">(j)</span><span class="cl">Answer #2 (R. Yochanan):</span> Both of these are known;</p>
<p class="bas indent2"><span class="nm">1.</span>Unknown property is what she inherits from an overseas relative while she is here.</p>
<p class="bas indent1"><span class="nm">(k)</span><span class="cl">Support (Beraisa):</span> Unknown property is what she inherits overseas while she is here.</p>
