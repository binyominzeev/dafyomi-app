<div class="indent1"><span class="nm">(a)</span><p><span class="cl">(Rav Nachman citing Rav):</span> If a ring of idolatry was mixed with 100 rings and one of them fell into the sea, all the rest are permitted. We assume that the forbidden one fell.</p></div>
<div class="indent1"><span class="nm">(b)</span><p><span class="cl">Question (Rava - Mishnah):</span> Even if one (Chatas ha'Mesah or Shor ha'Niskal) was mixed with 10,000, all must die.</p></div>
<div class="indent2"><span class="nm">1.</span><p>After the first dies, we do not assume that it was the forbidden animal!</p></div>
<div class="indent1"><span class="nm">(c)</span><p><span class="cl">Answer (Rav Nachman):</span> Rav holds like R. Eliezer;</p></div>
<div class="indent2"><span class="nm">1.</span><p><span class="cl">(Mishnah - R. Eliezer):</span> If one of the heads was offered, we offer the rest of the heads.</p></div>
<div class="indent1"><span class="nm">(d)</span><p><span class="cl">Question:</span> R. Elazar said that R. Eliezer permits only offering two at a time (since one of them is surely Kosher, we assume that the other is also), but not one at a time!</p></div>
<div class="indent1"><span class="nm">(e)</span><p><span class="cl">Answer (Rav Nachman):</span> Indeed, Rav permits the rest of the rings to be sold only two (or more) at a time.</p></div>
<div class="indent1"><span class="nm">(f)</span><p><span class="cl">(Rav Nachman citing Rav):</span> If a ring of idolatry became mixed among 100 rings, and 40 rings became separated from the other 60:</p></div>
<div class="indent2"><span class="nm">1.</span><p>If one of the 40 became mixed with other rings, it does not forbid them. If the 60 became mixed with others, it forbids them.</p></div>
<div class="indent2"><span class="nm">2.</span><p><span class="cl">Objection:</span> If one of the 40 became mixed, it does not forbid because we assume that (it is permitted,) the forbidden ring is among the majority (the remaining rings). We should say the same when one of the 60 became mixed with others!</p></div>
<div class="indent2"><span class="nm">3.</span><p><span class="cl">Correction:</span> Rather, if all 40 became mixed with other rings, they do not forbid the new mixture. If all 60 became mixed, they forbid.</p></div>
<div class="indent1"><span class="nm">(g)</span><p><span class="cl">(Shmuel):</span> Even if one of the 40 became mixed, it forbids, for we are always stringent about idolatry, no matter how many doubts there are.</p></div>
<div class="indent1"><span class="nm">(h)</span><p><span class="cl">Question (Beraisa):</span> A Safek case of idolatry is forbidden. We permit a Sefek Sefeka (there are two doubts, and if at least one of them is (in truth) 'favorable', the matter is permitted).</p></div>
<div class="indent2"><span class="nm">1.</span><p>If a cup of (forbidden due to) idolatry fell into a storehouse of cups, all are forbidden. If one was mixed with 10,000, and one of those became mixed with 10,000, they are permitted.</p></div>
<div class="indent1"><span class="nm">(i)</span><p><span class="cl">Answer:</span> Tana'im argue about Shmuel's law (he holds like a different Tana);</p></div>
<div class="indent2"><span class="nm">1.</span><p><span class="cl">(Beraisa - R. Yehudah):</span> (Forbidden) pomegranates of Badan forbid a mixture of any size;</p></div>
<div class="indent2"><span class="nm">2.</span><p>If one was mixed with 10,000 others, and one of this mixture became mixed with 10,000 others, it forbids all of them.</p></div>
<div class="indent2"><span class="nm">3.</span><p>R. Shimon ben Yehudah says in the name of R. Shimon, if one was mixed with 10,000, it forbids them. If one of them became mixed with three, and one of these became mixed with others, they are permitted.</p></div>
<div class="indent1"><span class="nm">(j)</span><p><span class="cl">Question:</span> Like which Tana does Shmuel hold?</p></div>
<div class="indent2"><span class="nm">1.</span><p>He is unlike R. Yehudah, for R. Yehudah forbids a Sefek Sefeka regarding all Isurim;</p></div>
<div class="indent2"><span class="nm">2.</span><p>He is unlike R. Shimon, for R. Shimon permits a Sefek Sefeka even regarding idolatry!</p></div>
<div class="indent2"><span class="nm">3.</span><p><span class="cl">Suggestion:</span> (The Beraisa did not explicitly mention idolatry.) Perhaps R. Shimon permits a Sefek Sefeka regarding other Isurim, but forbids regarding idolatry!</p></div>
<div class="indent2"><span class="nm">4.</span><p><span class="cl">Rejection:</span> If so, the following Beraisa would not be like R. Yehudah nor like R. Shimon! (What is Shmuel's source to say that there is a three-way argument among the Tana'im?!)</p></div>
<div class="indent3"><span class="nm">i.</span><p><span class="cl">(Beraisa):</span> A Safek regarding idolatry is forbidden, a Sefek Sefeka is permitted.</p></div>
<div class="indent1"><span class="nm">(k)</span><p><span class="cl">Answer (#1):</span> Shmuel holds like R. Yehudah regarding idolatry. He argues with him (and holds like R. Shimon) regarding other Isurim.</p></div>
<div class="indent1"><span class="nm">(l)</span><p><span class="cl">(Beraisa - R. Shimon):</span> If one of the 10,000 became mixed with three, and one of these became mixed with others, they are permitted.</p></div>
<div class="bbbline">74b----------------------------------------74b</p></div>
<div class="indent1"><span class="nm">(m)</span><p><span class="cl">Question:</span> Why must we say that it became mixed with three? Even if it became mixed with two, they are the majority!</p></div>
<div class="indent1"><span class="nm">(n)</span><p><span class="cl">Answer (#1):</span> Indeed, it means that it became mixed with two others, a total of three.</p></div>
<div class="indent1"><span class="nm">(o)</span><p><span class="cl">Version #1 - Tosfos - Answer #2 (to Question (m)):</span> R. Shimon holds like R. Eliezer according to R. Elazar. (We must sell two at a time, so that surely at least one (and possibly both) of them is permitted. If the entire mixture consist of three, there is no way to benefit from all of them.)</p></div>
<div class="indent1"><span class="nm">(p)</span><p><span class="cl">Version #2 - Rashi - Answer #2 (to Question (j)):</span> Shmuel holds like R. Eliezer (who forbids a Sefek Sefeka regarding idolatry. He requires throwing the value of the idolatry into the sea.)</p></div>
<div class="subject"><span class="nm">2)</span><p>IF PART OF A MIXTURE BECAME LOST</p></div>
<div class="indent1"><span class="nm">(a)</span><p><span class="cl">(Reish Lakish):</span> If a (sealed) barrel of Terumah became mixed with 100 (permitted) barrels, and one of them fell into the sea, the rest are permitted.</p></div>
<div class="indent1"><span class="nm">(b)</span><p>We need to hear Reish Lakish's law and Rav Nachman's (1:a, when a ring of idolatry fell into the sea);</p></div>
<div class="indent2"><span class="nm">1.</span><p>Had we heard only Rav Nachman's law, one might have thought that this applies only to idolatry, for Ein Lo Matirim (there is no way to permit it other than Bitul), but we do not permit Terumah in this way, for Yesh Lo Matirim (Kohanim may eat it);</p></div>
<div class="indent2"><span class="nm">2.</span><p>Had we heard only Reish Lakish's law, one might have thought that this applies only when a barrel falls in, for this is recognizable, but people do not notice when a ring falls. If we permit the rest, onlookers will think that a mixture is permitted even if one did not fall.</p></div>
<div class="indent1"><span class="nm">(c)</span><p><span class="cl">(Rabah):</span> Reish Lakish permits only regarding a barrel, for this is recognizable, but he would not permit regarding a fig.</p></div>
<div class="indent1"><span class="nm">(d)</span><p><span class="cl">(Rav Yosef):</span> He permits even regarding a fig. Just like when it is mixed in, it is significant enough to forbid the mixture, when one falls to the sea, it is significant enough to permit the rest.</p></div>
<div class="indent1"><span class="nm">(e)</span><p><span class="cl">(R. Elazar):</span> If a barrel of Terumah became mixed with 100 barrels, we open one of them, remove Kedai Dimu'a (the proportionate amount of Terumah, i.e. one part in 101 (Rashi; Shitah Mekubetzes - one part in 100)) and one may drink the rest of the barrel.</p></div>
<div class="indent1"><span class="nm">(f)</span><p><span class="cl">Objection (Rav Nachman):</span> This cannot be! (If so, closed barrels are not Mekadesh.)</p></div>
<div class="indent1"><span class="nm">(g)</span><p><span class="cl">Correction:</span> Rather, if one of them was opened, we remove Kedai Dimu'a, and one may drink the rest of it.</p></div>
<div class="indent1"><span class="nm">(h)</span><p><span class="cl">(R. Oshaya):</span> If a barrel of Terumah became mixed with 150 barrels, and 100 of them were opened, we remove Kedai Dimu'a from each and the rest of the open barrels is permitted;</p></div>
<div class="indent2"><span class="nm">1.</span><p>The other 50 barrels are forbidden until they are opened. We do not assume that the Terumah was among the majority of barrels that were opened.</p></div>
<div class="subject"><span class="nm">3)</span><p>HOW A <i>TEREIFAH</i> BECAME MIXED</p></div>
<div class="indent1"><span class="nm">(a)</span><p><span class="cl">(Mishnah):</span> The animal was Nirva or Rove'a...</p></div>
<div class="indent1"><span class="nm">(b)</span><p><span class="cl">Question:</span> (With the exception of Treifah,) all of these are not recognizable, so we understand how they are mixed. However, what is the case of Treifah?</p></div>
<div class="indent2"><span class="nm">1.</span><p>If it is recognizably Treifah, we can remove it and offer the others;</p></div>
<div class="indent2"><span class="nm">2.</span><p>If it is not recognizably Treifah, how do we know that a Treifah is among them?</p></div>
<div class="indent1"><span class="nm">(c)</span><p><span class="cl">Answer #1 (d'Vei R. Yanai):</span> The case is, a wolf was Dores (scratched with its venomous claws) an animal, and that animal was mixed with animals scratched by a thorn. (The scratches look the same, but only the first animal is a Tereifah.)</p></div>
<div class="indent1"><span class="nm">(d)</span><p><span class="cl">Answer #2 (Reish Lakish):</span> An animal that fell (from the roof) became mixed with other animals.</p></div>
<div class="indent2"><span class="nm">1.</span><p><span class="cl">Question:</span> If an animal fell, and later walked, this shows that it is Kosher!</p></div>
<div class="indent2"><span class="nm">2.</span><p><span class="cl">Answer:</span> Reish Lakish holds that even if it stood up, we must wait 24 hours before slaughtering it, and even if it walked, we must check it (internally, after Shechitah. The answer is based on the latter law. Waiting 24 hours is not pertinent to the question.)</p></div>
<div class="indent1"><span class="nm">(e)</span><p><span class="cl">Answer #3 (R. Yirmeyah):</span> The child of a Treifah became mixed with other animals. The Mishnah is like R. Eliezer, who disqualifies such an animal for a Korban.</p></div>
<div class="indent2"><span class="nm">1.</span><p>The other (i.e. last two) opinions did not say like D'Vei R. Yanai, for they hold that the scars are recognizable. Drisah is a long scratch, but a thorn makes a circular cut;</p></div>
<div class="indent2"><span class="nm">2.</span><p>The others opinions did not say like Reish Lakish, for they hold that if it stood up, we need not wait 24 hours. If it walked, we need not check it, and it is Kosher. (Therefore, all animals in the mixture that can walk are Kesherim);</p></div>
<div class="indent2"><span class="nm">3.</span><p>The others did not say like R. Yirmeyah, for they do not want to establish a Stam Mishnah like R. Eliezer.</p></div>
<div class="subject"><span class="nm">4)</span><p><i>KODSHIM</i> THAT BECAME MIXED</p></div>
<div class="indent1"><span class="nm">(a)</span><p><span class="cl">(Mishnah):</span> If Kodshim became mixed with Kodshim, Min b'Mino (we offer each (Tosfos - Stam, which is) l'Shem its owner...)</p></div>
<div class="indent1"><span class="nm">(b)</span><p><span class="cl">Question:</span> The owner cannot do Semichah (press down on the neck of the Korban! One may support himself on a Korban only when it is a Mitzvah, i.e. one's own Korban. Here, no one knows which Korban is his!)</p></div>
<div class="indent1"><span class="nm">(c)</span><p><span class="cl">Answer (Rav Yosef):</span> The Mishnah discusses Korbanos of women. (They are exempt from Semichah.)</p></div>
<div class="indent1"><span class="nm">(d)</span><p><span class="cl">Inference:</span> We would not offer Korbanos of men (because Semichah is required, but it cannot be done)!</p></div>
