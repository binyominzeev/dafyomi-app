<p class="bas subject"><span class="nm">1)</span>THOSE WHO DO NOT RECEIVE <i>SHEVACH</i> AND <i>RA'UY</i></p>
<p class="bas indent1"><span class="nm">(a)</span><span class="cl">(Continuation of Mishnah):</span> Also the following only receive from Muchzak, but not from Shevach or Ra'uy:</p>
<p class="bas indent2"><span class="nm">1.</span>A woman collecting a Kesuvah, (Rashi - step-)daughters being fed from their (step-)father's estate, and a Yavam (who did Yibum and inherits his deceased brother).</p>
<p class="bas indent1"><span class="nm">(b)</span><span class="cl">(Gemara) Question:</span> What is the reason (for these laws?)</p>
<p class="bas indent1"><span class="nm">(c)</span><span class="cl">Answer:</span> "<i>Lo</i> Mishpat ha'Bechorah" teaches that it applies to (property of) a man, but not (of) a woman;</p>
<p class="bas indent2"><span class="nm">1.</span>He does not receive a double portion of Shevach, nor from Ra'uy, for it says "b'Chol Asher Yimatzei Lo" (at the time of death).</p>
<p class="bas indent1"><span class="nm">(d)</span><span class="cl">Question:</span> Why does our Mishnah say that a woman does not collect Shevach? (She is like a creditor.) Shmuel taught that a creditor collects Shevach!</p>
<p class="bas indent1"><span class="nm">(e)</span><span class="cl">Answer (R. Aba):</span> This is a weakness of collection rights of a Kesuvah. (Similarly, it is collected from lowest quality land, unlike standard debts.)</p>
<p class="bas indent1"><span class="nm">(f)</span><span class="cl">(Mishnah):</span> Daughters are not fed (from Shevach or Ra'uy).</p>
<p class="bas indent1"><span class="nm">(g)</span><span class="cl">Question:</span> What is the reason?</p>
<p class="bas indent1"><span class="nm">(h)</span><span class="cl">Answer:</span> Stipulations of the Kesuvah are just like the Kesuvah. (Tosfos - the Kesuvah states that orphaned daughters are fed from the estate until they mature or get married; Rashi - we discuss a man who obligated himself to feed his wife's daughter (from a previous marriage) for a set time (and wrote this in the Kesuvah), and he died within the time.)</p>
<p class="bas indent1"><span class="nm">(i)</span><span class="cl">(Mishnah):</span> A Yavam (inherits what was Muchzak to his deceased brother, but not Shevach or Ra'uy - Rambam, according to Magid Mishnah; Rashi - he inherits his brother totally, and gets an extra share (due to the Yibum) of what was Muchzak to his father, but not of Shevach and Ra'uy.)</p>
<p class="bas indent1"><span class="nm">(j)</span><span class="cl">Question:</span> What is the reason?</p>
<p class="bas indent1"><span class="nm">(k)</span><span class="cl">Answer:</span> He is called "Bechor." (Therefore, he inherits like a Bechor.</p>
<p class="bas indent1"><span class="nm">(l)</span><span class="cl">(Abaye):</span> This applies only to Shevach between the death (of his father/brother (according to Rashi/Rambam) and Yibum, but he receives Shevach between Yibum and division.</p>
<p class="bas indent2"><span class="nm">1.</span><span class="cl">Question:</span> What is the reason?</p>
<p class="bas indent2"><span class="nm">2.</span><span class="cl">Answer:</span> "Yakum Al Shem Achiv" teaches that once he did Yibum, his brother's property (or share) (and, therefore, future Shevach) belongs to him.</p>
<p class="bas indent1"><span class="nm">(m)</span><span class="cl">(Rava):</span> This applies even to Shevach between Yibum and division.</p>
<p class="bas indent2"><span class="nm">1.</span><span class="cl">Question:</span> What is the reason?</p>
<p class="bas indent2"><span class="nm">2.</span><span class="cl">Answer:</span> He is like a Bechor, who receives no Shevach before division.</p>
<p class="bas indent1"><span class="nm">(n)</span><span class="cl">(Mishnah):</span> All of these do not receive Shevach.</p>
<p class="bas bbbline">52b----------------------------------------52b</p>
<p class="bas indent1"><span class="nm">(o)</span>This (is extra, for the Mishnah already said this. It) includes Shevach that comes automatically (without work), such as fodder or unripe dates that grew to be proper grain or dates.</p>
<p class="bas indent1"><span class="nm">(p)</span><span class="cl">(Mishnah):</span> They do not receive Ra'uy, only Muchzak.</p>
<p class="bas indent1"><span class="nm">(q)</span>This (is extra. It) includes property inherited from a grandfather. (It was surely destined to fall to the grandchildren.)</p>
<p class="bas subject"><span class="nm">2)</span>WHAT IS RETURNED IN <i>YOVEL</i></p>
<p class="bas indent1"><span class="nm">(a)</span><span class="cl">(Mishnah - R. Meir):</span> The following are not returned in Yovel:</p>
<p class="bas indent2"><span class="nm">1.</span>The extra portion of a Bechor, inheritance of a wife, inheritance of a Yavam, and a gift.</p>
<p class="bas indent1"><span class="nm">(b)</span>Chachamim say, a gift is like a sale. (It returns in Yovel.)</p>
<p class="bas indent1"><span class="nm">(c)</span>R. Eliezer says, all of them return in Yovel.</p>
<p class="bas indent1"><span class="nm">(d)</span>R. Yochanan ben Brokah says, one who inherits his wife returns it to her family, and deducts from the money (that they pay to him. This will be explained.)</p>
<p class="bas indent1"><span class="nm">(e)</span><span class="cl">(Gemara) Question:</span> What is R. Meir's reason?</p>
<p class="bas indent1"><span class="nm">(f)</span><span class="cl">Answer:</span> The Torah said only that a sale returns in Yovel, but not a gift or inheritance. This explains the last three cases;</p>
<p class="bas indent2"><span class="nm">1.</span>A Bechor's extra portion is called a gift - "<i>Lases</i> Lo Pi Shnayim".</p>
<p class="bas indent1"><span class="nm">(g)</span><span class="cl">(Mishnah):</span> Inheritance of a wife.</p>
<p class="bas indent1"><span class="nm">(h)</span>The Tana holds that a husband inherits his wife mid'Oraisa.</p>
<p class="bas indent1"><span class="nm">(i)</span><span class="cl">(Mishnah):</span> Inheritance of a Yavam.</p>
<p class="bas indent1"><span class="nm">(j)</span>One who does Yibum is called "Bechor".</p>
<p class="bas indent1"><span class="nm">(k)</span><span class="cl">(Mishnah - Chachamim):</span> A gift is like a sale.</p>
<p class="bas indent1"><span class="nm">(l)</span><span class="cl">Question:</span> What is Chachamim's reason?</p>
<p class="bas indent1"><span class="nm">(m)</span><span class="cl">Answer:</span> "Tashuvu" is extra (Rashi; R. Gershom - it could have said 'Shuvu'), to teach that a gift returns;</p>
<p class="bas indent2"><span class="nm">1.</span>The other three are inheritances, even Bechorah;</p>
<p class="bas indent2"><span class="nm">2.</span>They hold that "Lases Lo Pi Shnayim" equates the extra portion to a regular portion, i.e. it is an inheritance.</p>
<p class="bas indent1"><span class="nm">(n)</span><span class="cl">(Mishnah - R. Eliezer):</span> All of them return in Yovel.</p>
<p class="bas indent1"><span class="nm">(o)</span>He holds like Chachamim, who say that "Tashuvu" includes a gift. All the others are called (or were enacted to be like) gifts:</p>
<p class="bas indent2"><span class="nm">1.</span>Regarding Bechorah it says "<i>Lases</i> Lo Pi Shnayim";</p>
<p class="bas indent2"><span class="nm">2.</span>He holds that a husband inherits his wife mid'Rabanan;</p>
<p class="bas indent2"><span class="nm">3.</span>One who does Yibum is called "Bechor".</p>
<p class="bas indent1"><span class="nm">(p)</span><span class="cl">(R. Asi citing R. Yochanan):</span> If brothers divide an inheritance, (Ein Breirah, i.e. we cannot say that the portion everyone took was destined for him. Rather,) they are like buyers. (Everyone took a share in exchange for his true portion). They must return their shares and redivide in Yovel. (Rashi - each can get a new share; Rambam - each gets back his old share again.)</p>
<p class="bas indent1"><span class="nm">(q)</span><span class="cl">Question (R. Hoshaya - Mishnah):</span> The following are not returned in Yovel - Bechorah... (according to R. Asi, all brothers return their shares!)</p>
<p class="bas indent1"><span class="nm">(r)</span><span class="cl">Answer (R. Elazar):</span> The Mishnah means that the following do not return in Yovel what they received <i>and lose it</i>. (Rather, they return it and receive it (or another share) back again.)</p>
<p class="bas indent1"><span class="nm">(s)</span><span class="cl">Question (Rav Sheshes):</span> This implies that the opinion that says that they do return holds that they lose it. (This is unreasonable!)</p>
<p class="bas indent2"><span class="nm">1.</span><span class="cl">Version #1 - Rav Chama:</span> Great is one who knows Amora'ic teachings along with an abundance of Beraisos! (Rav Sheshes has (only) the latter.)</p>
<p class="bas indent2"><span class="nm">2.</span><span class="cl">Version #2 - R. Gershom - Rami bar Chama:</span> This question testifies to the Chachmah of Rav Sheshes! (end of Version #2)</p>
<p class="bas indent2"><span class="nm">3.</span>Apparently, the following teaching was not known to Rav Sheshes (R. Gershom - and Rami bar Chama!)</p>
<p class="bas indent2"><span class="nm">4.</span><span class="cl">(Ravin citing R. Yochanan):</span> The opinion that says that they return, he holds that they lose it.</p>
<p class="bas subject"><span class="nm">3)</span>INHERITING BURIAL GROUNDS</p>
<p class="bas indent1"><span class="nm">(a)</span><span class="cl">(Mishnah - R. Yochanan ben Brokah):</span> One who inherits his wife returns it to her family...</p>
<p class="bas indent1"><span class="nm">(b)</span><span class="cl">Question:</span> Does he hold that a husband inherits his wife mid'Oraisa, or mid'Rabanan?</p>
<p class="bas indent2"><span class="nm">1.</span>If it is mid'Oraisa, why does he return it?</p>
<p class="bas indent2"><span class="nm">2.</span>If it is mid'Rabanan, why does her family pay him?</p>
<p class="bas indent1"><span class="nm">(c)</span><span class="cl">Answer:</span> A husband inherits his wife mid'Oraisa. The case is, he inherited her family's burial grounds from her;</p>
<p class="bas indent2"><span class="nm">1.</span>Chachamim enacted that he sells it back to them, to prevent disgrace;</p>
<p class="bas indent2"><span class="nm">2.</span><span class="cl">(Beraisa):</span> If one sells (the place reserved for) his grave, the path to it, or the place of his Ma'amad (where they pause during the funeral procession) and eulogy, his family can bury him there against the will of the buyer, due to disgrace to the family.</p>
