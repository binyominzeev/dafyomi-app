<div class="subject"><span class="nm">1)</span><p>THOSE WHO DO NOT RECEIVE SHEVACH AND RA'UY</p></div>
<div class="indent1"><span class="nm">(a)</span><p><span class="cl">(Continuation of Mishnah):</span> Also the following only receive from Muchzak, but not from Shevach or Ra'uy:</p></div>
<div class="indent2"><span class="nm">1.</span><p>A woman collecting a Kesuvah, (Rashi - step-)daughters being fed from their (step-)father's estate, and a Yavam (who did Yibum and inherits his deceased brother).</p></div>
<div class="indent1"><span class="nm">(b)</span><p><span class="cl">(Gemara) Question:</span> What is the reason (for these laws?)</p></div>
<div class="indent1"><span class="nm">(c)</span><p><span class="cl">Answer:</span> "<i>Lo</i> Mishpat ha'Bechorah" teaches that it applies to (property of) a man, but not (of) a woman;</p></div>
<div class="indent2"><span class="nm">1.</span><p>He does not receive a double portion of Shevach, nor from Ra'uy, for it says "b'Chol Asher Yimatzei Lo" (at the time of death).</p></div>
<div class="indent1"><span class="nm">(d)</span><p><span class="cl">Question:</span> Why does our Mishnah say that a woman does not collect Shevach? (She is like a creditor.) Shmuel taught that a creditor collects Shevach!</p></div>
<div class="indent1"><span class="nm">(e)</span><p><span class="cl">Answer (R. Aba):</span> This is a weakness of collection rights of a Kesuvah. (Similarly, it is collected from lowest quality land, unlike standard debts.)</p></div>
<div class="indent1"><span class="nm">(f)</span><p><span class="cl">(Mishnah):</span> Daughters are not fed (from Shevach or Ra'uy).</p></div>
<div class="indent1"><span class="nm">(g)</span><p><span class="cl">Question:</span> What is the reason?</p></div>
<div class="indent1"><span class="nm">(h)</span><p><span class="cl">Answer:</span> Stipulations of the Kesuvah are just like the Kesuvah. (Tosfos - the Kesuvah states that orphaned daughters are fed from the estate until they mature or get married; Rashi - we discuss a man who obligated himself to feed his wife's daughter (from a previous marriage) for a set time (and wrote this in the Kesuvah), and he died within the time.)</p></div>
<div class="indent1"><span class="nm">(i)</span><p><span class="cl">(Mishnah):</span> A Yavam (inherits what was Muchzak to his deceased brother, but not Shevach or Ra'uy - Rambam, according to Magid Mishnah; Rashi - he inherits his brother totally, and gets an extra share (due to the Yibum) of what was Muchzak to his father, but not of Shevach and Ra'uy.)</p></div>
<div class="indent1"><span class="nm">(j)</span><p><span class="cl">Question:</span> What is the reason?</p></div>
<div class="indent1"><span class="nm">(k)</span><p><span class="cl">Answer:</span> He is called "Bechor." (Therefore, he inherits like a Bechor.</p></div>
<div class="indent1"><span class="nm">(l)</span><p><span class="cl">(Abaye):</span> This applies only to Shevach between the death (of his father/brother (according to Rashi/Rambam) and Yibum, but he receives Shevach between Yibum and division.</p></div>
<div class="indent2"><span class="nm">1.</span><p><span class="cl">Question:</span> What is the reason?</p></div>
<div class="indent2"><span class="nm">2.</span><p><span class="cl">Answer:</span> "Yakum Al Shem Achiv" teaches that once he did Yibum, his brother's property (or share) (and, therefore, future Shevach) belongs to him.</p></div>
<div class="indent1"><span class="nm">(m)</span><p><span class="cl">(Rava):</span> This applies even to Shevach between Yibum and division.</p></div>
<div class="indent2"><span class="nm">1.</span><p><span class="cl">Question:</span> What is the reason?</p></div>
<div class="indent2"><span class="nm">2.</span><p><span class="cl">Answer:</span> He is like a Bechor, who receives no Shevach before division.</p></div>
<div class="indent1"><span class="nm">(n)</span><p><span class="cl">(Mishnah):</span> All of these do not receive Shevach.</p></div>
<div class="bbbline">52b----------------------------------------52b</p></div>
<div class="indent1"><span class="nm">(o)</span><p>This (is extra, for the Mishnah already said this. It) includes Shevach that comes automatically (without work), such as fodder or unripe dates that grew to be proper grain or dates.</p></div>
<div class="indent1"><span class="nm">(p)</span><p><span class="cl">(Mishnah):</span> They do not receive Ra'uy, only Muchzak.</p></div>
<div class="indent1"><span class="nm">(q)</span><p>This (is extra. It) includes property inherited from a grandfather. (It was surely destined to fall to the grandchildren.)</p></div>
<div class="subject"><span class="nm">2)</span><p>WHAT IS RETURNED IN YOVEL</p></div>
<div class="indent1"><span class="nm">(a)</span><p><span class="cl">(Mishnah - R. Meir):</span> The following are not returned in Yovel:</p></div>
<div class="indent2"><span class="nm">1.</span><p>The extra portion of a Bechor, inheritance of a wife, inheritance of a Yavam, and a gift.</p></div>
<div class="indent1"><span class="nm">(b)</span><p>Chachamim say, a gift is like a sale. (It returns in Yovel.)</p></div>
<div class="indent1"><span class="nm">(c)</span><p>R. Eliezer says, all of them return in Yovel.</p></div>
<div class="indent1"><span class="nm">(d)</span><p>R. Yochanan ben Brokah says, one who inherits his wife returns it to her family, and deducts from the money (that they pay to him. This will be explained.)</p></div>
<div class="indent1"><span class="nm">(e)</span><p><span class="cl">(Gemara) Question:</span> What is R. Meir's reason?</p></div>
<div class="indent1"><span class="nm">(f)</span><p><span class="cl">Answer:</span> The Torah said only that a sale returns in Yovel, but not a gift or inheritance. This explains the last three cases;</p></div>
<div class="indent2"><span class="nm">1.</span><p>A Bechor's extra portion is called a gift - "<i>Lases</i> Lo Pi Shnayim".</p></div>
<div class="indent1"><span class="nm">(g)</span><p><span class="cl">(Mishnah):</span> Inheritance of a wife.</p></div>
<div class="indent1"><span class="nm">(h)</span><p>The Tana holds that a husband inherits his wife mid'Oraisa.</p></div>
<div class="indent1"><span class="nm">(i)</span><p><span class="cl">(Mishnah):</span> Inheritance of a Yavam.</p></div>
<div class="indent1"><span class="nm">(j)</span><p>One who does Yibum is called "Bechor".</p></div>
<div class="indent1"><span class="nm">(k)</span><p><span class="cl">(Mishnah - Chachamim):</span> A gift is like a sale.</p></div>
<div class="indent1"><span class="nm">(l)</span><p><span class="cl">Question:</span> What is Chachamim's reason?</p></div>
<div class="indent1"><span class="nm">(m)</span><p><span class="cl">Answer:</span> "Tashuvu" is extra (Rashi; R. Gershom - it could have said 'Shuvu'), to teach that a gift returns;</p></div>
<div class="indent2"><span class="nm">1.</span><p>The other three are inheritances, even Bechorah;</p></div>
<div class="indent2"><span class="nm">2.</span><p>They hold that "Lases Lo Pi Shnayim" equates the extra portion to a regular portion, i.e. it is an inheritance.</p></div>
<div class="indent1"><span class="nm">(n)</span><p><span class="cl">(Mishnah - R. Eliezer):</span> All of them return in Yovel.</p></div>
<div class="indent1"><span class="nm">(o)</span><p>He holds like Chachamim, who say that "Tashuvu" includes a gift. All the others are called (or were enacted to be like) gifts:</p></div>
<div class="indent2"><span class="nm">1.</span><p>Regarding Bechorah it says "<i>Lases</i> Lo Pi Shnayim";</p></div>
<div class="indent2"><span class="nm">2.</span><p>He holds that a husband inherits his wife mid'Rabanan;</p></div>
<div class="indent2"><span class="nm">3.</span><p>One who does Yibum is called "Bechor".</p></div>
<div class="indent1"><span class="nm">(p)</span><p><span class="cl">(R. Asi citing R. Yochanan):</span> If brothers divide an inheritance, (Ein Breirah, i.e. we cannot say that the portion everyone took was destined for him. Rather,) they are like buyers. (Everyone took a share in exchange for his true portion). They must return their shares and redivide in Yovel. (Rashi - each can get a new share; Rambam - each gets back his old share again.)</p></div>
<div class="indent1"><span class="nm">(q)</span><p><span class="cl">Question (R. Hoshaya - Mishnah):</span> The following are not returned in Yovel - Bechorah... (according to R. Asi, all brothers return their shares!)</p></div>
<div class="indent1"><span class="nm">(r)</span><p><span class="cl">Answer (R. Elazar):</span> The Mishnah means that the following do not return in Yovel what they received <i>and lose it</i>. (Rather, they return it and receive it (or another share) back again.)</p></div>
<div class="indent1"><span class="nm">(s)</span><p><span class="cl">Question (Rav Sheshes):</span> This implies that the opinion that says that they do return holds that they lose it. (This is unreasonable!)</p></div>
<div class="indent2"><span class="nm">1.</span><p><span class="cl">Version #1 - Rav Chama:</span> Great is one who knows Amora'ic teachings along with an abundance of Beraisos! (Rav Sheshes has (only) the latter.)</p></div>
<div class="indent2"><span class="nm">2.</span><p><span class="cl">Version #2 - R. Gershom - Rami bar Chama:</span> This question testifies to the Chachmah of Rav Sheshes! (end of Version #2)</p></div>
<div class="indent2"><span class="nm">3.</span><p>Apparently, the following teaching was not known to Rav Sheshes (R. Gershom - and Rami bar Chama!)</p></div>
<div class="indent2"><span class="nm">4.</span><p><span class="cl">(Ravin citing R. Yochanan):</span> The opinion that says that they return, he holds that they lose it.</p></div>
<div class="subject"><span class="nm">3)</span><p>INHERITING BURIAL GROUNDS</p></div>
<div class="indent1"><span class="nm">(a)</span><p><span class="cl">(Mishnah - R. Yochanan ben Brokah):</span> One who inherits his wife returns it to her family...</p></div>
<div class="indent1"><span class="nm">(b)</span><p><span class="cl">Question:</span> Does he hold that a husband inherits his wife mid'Oraisa, or mid'Rabanan?</p></div>
<div class="indent2"><span class="nm">1.</span><p>If it is mid'Oraisa, why does he return it?</p></div>
<div class="indent2"><span class="nm">2.</span><p>If it is mid'Rabanan, why does her family pay him?</p></div>
<div class="indent1"><span class="nm">(c)</span><p><span class="cl">Answer:</span> A husband inherits his wife mid'Oraisa. The case is, he inherited her family's burial grounds from her;</p></div>
<div class="indent2"><span class="nm">1.</span><p>Chachamim enacted that he sells it back to them, to prevent disgrace;</p></div>
<div class="indent2"><span class="nm">2.</span><p><span class="cl">(Beraisa):</span> If one sells (the place reserved for) his grave, the path to it, or the place of his Ma'amad (where they pause during the funeral procession) and eulogy, his family can bury him there against the will of the buyer, due to disgrace to the family.</p></div>
