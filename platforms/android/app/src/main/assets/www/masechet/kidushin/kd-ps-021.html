<p class="dedicationbox">KIDUSHIN 21 (30 Tishrei) - dedicated by Reb Mordechai Rabin (London/Yerushalayim) l'Iluy Nishmas his father, ha'Gaon Rav Gedalya Rabinowitz of Manchester, England (and in his later years, Bnei Brak, Israel). Hearing a Shiur of his was an unforgettable experience as can be attested to by his many Talmidim, both Bnei Yeshiva and Ba'alei Batim. </p>

<p class="bas subject"><span class="nm">1)</span>PARTIAL REDEMPTION OF A FIELD</p>
<p class="bas indent1"><span class="nm">(a)</span><span class="cl">Answer:</span> Beraisa #1 is like Chachamim who argue with R. Shimon (and do not learn new Halachos from our understanding of the Mitzvos).</p>
<p class="bas indent1"><span class="nm">(b)</span><span class="cl">(Beraisa #2):</span> One may borrow to redeem (a house). One may partially redeem it.</p>
<p class="bas indent1"><span class="nm">(c)</span><span class="cl">Contradiction (Beraisa #3):</span> One may not borrow to redeem (a house), one may not partially redeem it.</p>
<p class="bas indent1"><span class="nm">(d)</span><span class="cl">Answer:</span> Beraisa #2 is like R. Shimon, and Beraisa #3 is like Chachamim.</p>
<p class="bas indent1"><span class="nm">(e)</span><span class="cl">Question (Rav Acha Brei d'Rava):</span> Beraisa #1 needed a verse to override a Kal va'Chomer. The Kal va'Chomer can be refuted!</p>
<p class="bas indent2"><span class="nm">1.</span>One who sells his house does not have permanent rights of redemption. One cannot learn (that he cannot borrow to redeem it, or partially redeem it) to one who was Makdish his field, who has permanent redemption rights!</p>
<p class="bas indent1"><span class="nm">(f)</span><span class="cl">Answer (Rav Acha Sava):</span> (If not for the verse,) we would have learned from a Tzad ha'Shavah:</p>
<p class="bas indent2"><span class="nm">1.</span>One who sold his field has permanent redemption rights, yet he may not borrow to redeem it, or partially redeem it. The same applies to one who was Makdish his field.</p>
<p class="bas indent2"><span class="nm">2.</span><span class="cl">Question:</span> You cannot learn from one who sold his field, for he cannot redeem it in the first two years, whereas one who was Makdish his field can!</p>
<p class="bas indent2"><span class="nm">3.</span><span class="cl">Answer:</span> We learn from one who sold a house that the law does not depend on rights of immediate redemption.</p>
<p class="bas indent3"><span class="nm">i.</span>The Tzad ha'Shavah of (what is common to) one who sold a house and a field is that they may be redeemed, but one may not borrow to redeem or redeem partially. The same applies to one who was Makdish his field.</p>
<p class="bas indent1"><span class="nm">(g)</span><span class="cl">Question (Mar Zutra):</span> One cannot learn from the Tzad ha'Shavah! One who sold a house or a field cannot redeem it in the second year. We cannot learn from them to one who was Makdish his field, who can redeem in the second year!</p>
<p class="bas indent1"><span class="nm">(h)</span><span class="cl">Answer (Ravina):</span> One can learn from a Tzad ha'Shavah that also includes a slave sold to a Nochri, for he can be redeemed in the second year, but he may not borrow to redeem or redeem partially.</p>
<p class="bas subject"><span class="nm">2)</span>REDEMPTION THROUGH RELATIVES</p>
<p class="bas indent1"><span class="nm">(a)</span><span class="cl">Question (Rav Huna bar Chinena):</span> If one sold a house in a walled city, can his relatives redeem it (against the will of the buyer)?</p>
<p class="bas indent2"><span class="nm">1.</span>Do we learn a Gezeirah Shavah "Ge'ulaso-Ge'ulaso" from one who sold an inherited field? It may not be partially redeemed, but may be redeemed through relatives. The same applies to a house;</p>
<p class="bas indent2"><span class="nm">2.</span>Or, perhaps the Gezeirah Shavah only teaches about partial redemption?</p>
<p class="bas indent1"><span class="nm">(b)</span><span class="cl">Answer (Rav Sheshes):</span> It may not be redeemed through relatives.</p>
<p class="bas indent1"><span class="nm">(c)</span><span class="cl">Question (Beraisa):</span> "In all, give redemption (through relatives)" includes houses and Avadim Ivriyim.</p>
<p class="bas indent2"><span class="nm">1.</span><span class="cl">Suggestion:</span> This refers to houses in walled cities.</p>
<p class="bas indent1"><span class="nm">(d)</span><span class="cl">Answer:</span> No, it refers to houses in courtyards.</p>
<p class="bas indent1"><span class="nm">(e)</span><span class="cl">Question:</span> We already learn about houses in courtyards from "it will be treated like fields"!</p>
<p class="bas indent1"><span class="nm">(f)</span><span class="cl">Answer:</span> "In all there will be redemption" obligates the relatives to redeem it. The Beraisa is like R. Eliezer:</p>
<p class="bas indent2"><span class="nm">1.</span><span class="cl">(Beraisa - R. Yehoshua):</span> "He will redeem what his brother sold" is optional;</p>
<p class="bas indent2"><span class="nm">2.</span><span class="cl">Question:</span> Perhaps it is obligatory!</p>
<p class="bas indent2"><span class="nm">3.</span><span class="cl">Answer:</span> "A man who will not have a redeemer" cannot mean that he has no relatives. Every Yisrael has relatives! Rather, it means that his relatives do not want to redeem.</p>
<p class="bas indent2"><span class="nm">4.</span>R. Eliezer says, "he will redeem what his brother sold" is obligatory;</p>
<p class="bas indent2"><span class="nm">5.</span><span class="cl">Question:</span> Perhaps it is optional!</p>
<p class="bas indent2"><span class="nm">6.</span><span class="cl">Answer:</span> "In all, there will be redemption" makes it obligatory.</p>
<p class="bas indent1"><span class="nm">(g)</span><span class="cl">Question (Ravina):</span> If "in all, there will be redemption" includes houses in walled cities, we understand why it says "in all". (We could not learn from fields, which can be redeemed after two years.)</p>
<p class="bas indent2"><span class="nm">1.</span>But if it refers to houses of courtyards, why does it say "in all"? (Since it already says "it will be treated like fields", it would have sufficed to say 'give redemption to the land'!)</p>
<p class="bas indent2"><span class="nm">2.</span>This is left difficult.</p>
<p class="bas indent1"><span class="nm">(h)</span><span class="cl">Question (Abaye - Beraisa):</span> (Regarding an Eved Ivri sold to a Nochri,) it says three times "Yig'alenu (he will redeem him)" to equate all redemptions (there is a Mitzvah for relatives to redeem them).</p>
<p class="bas indent2"><span class="nm">1.</span><span class="cl">Suggestion:</span> The other redemptions are a house in a walled city and an Eved Ivri (sold to a Yisrael).</p>
<p class="bas indent1"><span class="nm">(i)</span><span class="cl">Answer:</span> No, they are houses of courtyards and inherited fields.</p>
<p class="bas indent1"><span class="nm">(j)</span><span class="cl">Question:</span> We already know about houses in courtyards from "it will be treated like the field"!</p>
<p class="bas indent1"><span class="nm">(k)</span><span class="cl">Answer:</span> "Yig'alenu" teaches that the closest relatives have first priority to redeem, like Rav Nachman bar Yitzchak taught (regarding the following).</p>
<p class="bas indent2"><span class="nm">1.</span><span class="cl">Question:</span> Is an Eved Ivri sold to a Yisrael redeemed through relatives?</p>
<p class="bas indent3"><span class="nm">i.</span>We do not ask according to Rebbi (15b). He said that he is not redeemed through relatives.</p>
<p class="bas indent3"><span class="nm">ii.</span>We ask according to Chachamim. Do we learn from a Gezeirah Shavah "Sachir-Sachir", or do we expound "you will redeem him (one sold to a Nochri)", and not another (one sold to a Yisrael)"?</p>
<p class="bas indent2"><span class="nm">2.</span><span class="cl">Answer #1:</span> "In all, there will be redemption (through relatives)" includes houses and Eved Ivriyim.</p>
<p class="bas indent3"><span class="nm">i.</span><span class="cl">Suggestion:</span> This refers to houses in walled cities and an Eved Ivri sold to a Yisrael.</p>
<p class="bas indent2"><span class="nm">3.</span><span class="cl">Rejection:</span> No, it refers to a slave sold to a Nochri.</p>
<p class="bas indent3"><span class="nm">i.</span><span class="cl">Question:</span> It explicitly says about one sold to a Nochri "or his uncle or his cousin will redeem him"!</p>
<p class="bas bbbline">21b----------------------------------------21b</p>
<p class="bas indent3"><span class="nm">ii.</span><span class="cl">Answer:</span> "In all, there will be redemption" makes it obligatory to redeem him, even according to R. Yehoshua.</p>
<p class="bas indent2"><span class="nm">4.</span><span class="cl">Answer #2 (Beraisa):</span> The Torah says three times "Yig'alenu" to teach that all redemptions have the same order.</p>
<p class="bas indent3"><span class="nm">i.</span><span class="cl">Suggestion:</span> The other redemptions are a house in a walled city and an Eved Ivri.</p>
<p class="bas indent3"><span class="nm">ii.</span><span class="cl">Rejection:</span> No. It refers to houses of courtyards and inherited fields.</p>
<p class="bas indent3"><span class="nm">iii.</span><span class="cl">Question:</span> We already know about houses in courtyards from "like the field they will be considered!</p>
<p class="bas indent3"><span class="nm">iv.</span><span class="cl">Answer (Rav Nachman bar Yitzchak):</span> "Yig'alenu" teaches that the closest relatives have first priority to redeem.</p>
<p class="bas subject"><span class="nm">3)</span>BORING THROUGH THE EAR</p>
<p class="bas indent1"><span class="nm">(a)</span><span class="cl">(Mishnah):</span> A Nirtza is acquired by boring his ear.</p>
<p class="bas indent1"><span class="nm">(b)</span>We learn from "his master will bore through his ear with the awl"</p>
<p class="bas indent1"><span class="nm">(c)</span><span class="cl">(Mishnah):</span> He acquires (his freedom) in Yovel or when the master dies.</p>
<p class="bas indent1"><span class="nm">(d)</span>We learn from "He will serve him", not the son or daughter; "forever" - until Yovel.</p>
<p class="bas indent1"><span class="nm">(e)</span><span class="cl">(Beraisa - Rebbi Yosi b'Rebbi Yehudah) Question:</span> It says "awl". What is the source to include a sharp piece of wood, a thorn, a drill, or a stylus (an etching tool)?</p>
<p class="bas indent1"><span class="nm">(f)</span><span class="cl">Answer:</span> "And you will take" includes anything that can be taken in the hand;</p>
<p class="bas indent1"><span class="nm">(g)</span>Rebbi says, we include only metal instruments, just like an awl is of metal;</p>
<p class="bas indent2"><span class="nm">1.</span>Also, "the awl" comes to include the great awl.</p>
<p class="bas indent1"><span class="nm">(h)</span><span class="cl">(R. Elazar):</span> Yudan holds that we only pierce the ear in the flesh (not the cartilage);</p>
<p class="bas indent1"><span class="nm">(i)</span>Chachamim say, a Kohen cannot become a Nirtza, for this would blemish him.</p>
<p class="bas indent2"><span class="nm">1.</span>They must argue with Yudan. A hole in the flesh is not a blemish!</p>
<p class="bas indent2"><span class="nm">2.</span>Rather, we pierce higher in the ear.</p>
<p class="bas indent1"><span class="nm">(j)</span><span class="cl">Question:</span> What do Rebbi Yosi b'Rebbi Yehudah and Rebbi argue about?</p>
<p class="bas indent1"><span class="nm">(k)</span><span class="cl">Answer:</span> Rebbi expounds Klalim and Peratim (generalities and specific terms). "You will take" is a Klal. "An awl" is a Prat; "in his ear and in the door" is a Klal;</p>
<p class="bas indent2"><span class="nm">1.</span>The Klal u'Frat u'Chlal includes everything similar to the Prat, i.e. metal tools.</p>
<p class="bas indent1"><span class="nm">(l)</span>Rebbi Yosi expounds Ribuyim and Mi'utim (inclusions and exclusions). "You will take" is a Ribuy; "an awl" is a Mi'ut; "in his ear and in the door" is a Ribuy;</p>
<p class="bas indent2"><span class="nm">1.</span>The first Ribuy includes everything. The Mi'ut excludes a potion (e.g. acid).</p>
<p class="bas indent1"><span class="nm">(m)</span><span class="cl">Question:</span> How does the Beraisa expound "the awl" to include the great awl?</p>
<p class="bas indent1"><span class="nm">(n)</span><span class="cl">Answer:</span> This is like Rava taught.</p>
<p class="bas indent2"><span class="nm">1.</span><span class="cl">(Rava):</span> "(We may not eat the Gid ha'Nasheh in) the thigh" - the special thigh (the right one );</p>
<p class="bas indent2"><span class="nm">2.</span>Also here, the awl refers to the special (great) awl.</p>
<p class="bas subject"><span class="nm">4)</span>LAWS OF A KOHEN EVED IVRI</p>
<p class="bas indent1"><span class="nm">(a)</span><span class="cl">(Beraisa - R. Elazar):</span> Yudan holds that we pierce the ear only in the flesh (not the cartilage);</p>
<p class="bas indent1"><span class="nm">(b)</span>Chachamim say, a Kohen cannot become a Nirtza, for this would blemish him.</p>
<p class="bas indent1"><span class="nm">(c)</span><span class="cl">Question:</span> We should say that he can be Nirtza, and he will be blemished!</p>
<p class="bas indent1"><span class="nm">(d)</span><span class="cl">Answer (Rabah bar Rav Shilo):</span> "He will return to his family" - to the status quo of his family. (Kohanim serve in the Mikdash.)</p>
<p class="bas indent1"><span class="nm">(e)</span><span class="cl">Question:</span> Can a master mate a Kohen slave with a Shifchah?</p>
<p class="bas indent2"><span class="nm">1.</span>It is a Chidush (exceptional law) that an Eved Ivri may have Bi'ah with a Shifchah. This Chidush applies to a Kohen as well;</p>
<p class="bas indent2"><span class="nm">2.</span>Or, since the Torah gives extra Mitzvos to Kohanim, it is not lenient for them regarding a Shifchah.</p>
<p class="bas indent1"><span class="nm">(f)</span><span class="cl">Answer #1 (Rav):</span> It is permitted.</p>
<p class="bas indent1"><span class="nm">(g)</span><span class="cl">Answer #2 (Shmuel):</span> It is forbidden.</p>
<p class="bas indent1"><span class="nm">(h)</span><span class="cl">Question (Rav Nachman - Beraisa - Chachamim):</span> A Kohen cannot become a Nirtza, for this would blemish him.</p>
<p class="bas indent2"><span class="nm">1.</span>According to Shmuel, even without this he cannot become a Nirtza, for he cannot say "I love my master and my wife (Shifchah"! This would apply even to a blemished Kohen.)</p>
<p class="bas indent1"><span class="nm">(i)</span>There is no answer for this question.</p>
<p class="bas subject"><span class="nm">5)</span>MAY A KOHEN TAKE A YAFES TO'AR?</p>
<p class="bas indent1"><span class="nm">(a)</span><span class="cl">Question:</span> Can a Kohen take a Yefas To'ar (a beautiful Nochris in war)?</p>
<p class="bas indent2"><span class="nm">1.</span>It is a Chidush that a Yisrael can take her (Rashi - and force her to convert; Tosfos - and have Bi'ah with her before she converts). This Chidush applies to a Kohen as well;</p>
<p class="bas indent2"><span class="nm">2.</span>Or, since the Torah gives extra Mitzvos to Kohanim, it is not lenient for them regarding this.</p>
<p class="bas indent1"><span class="nm">(b)</span><span class="cl">Answer #1 (Rav):</span> It is permitted.</p>
<p class="bas indent1"><span class="nm">(c)</span><span class="cl">Answer #2 (Shmuel):</span> It is forbidden.</p>
<p class="bas indent1"><span class="nm">(d)</span><span class="cl">Version #1:</span> All agree that he is permitted one Bi'ah with her. The Torah permitted her only because the temptation is too great to overcome (for Kohanim as well);</p>
<p class="bas indent2"><span class="nm">1.</span>They argue about keeping her like a wife.</p>
<p class="bas indent2"><span class="nm">2.</span>Rav permits. Once he is permitted one Bi'ah with her, she is totally permitted.</p>
<p class="bas indent2"><span class="nm">3.</span>Shmuel forbids. A Kohen may not marry a convert.</p>
<p class="bas indent1"><span class="nm">(e)</span><span class="cl">Version #2:</span> All forbid keeping her for a wife, for she is a convert;</p>
<p class="bas indent2"><span class="nm">1.</span>They argue about having Bi'ah with her once.</p>
<p class="bas indent2"><span class="nm">2.</span>Rav permits. The Torah permitted her only because the temptation is too great;</p>
<p class="bas indent2"><span class="nm">3.</span>Shmuel forbids. Since "you will take her into your house" does not apply to a Kohen, neither does "and you will see among the captives (...and take her)". (end of Version #2)</p>
