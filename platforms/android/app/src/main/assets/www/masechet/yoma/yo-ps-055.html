May the merit of supporting and advancing Dafyomi study -- which was so important to him -- during the weeks of his Yahrzeit serve as an Iluy for his Neshamah.<BR>&nbsp;<BR>12TH CYCLE DEDICATIONS<BR>&nbsp;<BR>YOMA 55 (7 Av) - Dedicated in memory of Dr. Simcha Bekelnitzky (Simcha Gedalya ben Shraga Feibush) of Queens, N.Y., by his wife and daughters on his ninth Yahrzeit.
