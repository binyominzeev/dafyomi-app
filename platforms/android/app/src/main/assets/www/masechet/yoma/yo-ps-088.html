<div class="subject"><span class="nm">1)</span><p>TEVILAH ON YOM KIPUR (and Rav's position in the Machlokes)</p></div>
<div class="indent1"><span class="nm">(a)</span><p><span class="cl">(Tana Kama):</span> All Chayvei Tevilah should immerse on Yom Kipur, in order to be able to recite Tefilah (Tevilas Ezra).</p></div>
<div class="indent1"><span class="nm">(b)</span><p>Similarly, a Nidah and a Yoledes immerse on Yom Kipur night.</p></div>
<div class="indent1"><span class="nm">(c)</span><p>A Ba'al Keri who became Tamei after Minchah, may not immerse because, according to the Tana Kama, one recites Ne'ilah <i>after</i> nightfall, in which case, someone who becomes Tamei after Minchah, may immerse later, and not on Yom Kipur (and then recites Ne'ilah, exempting himself from Ma'ariv, like Rav).</p></div>
<div class="indent1"><span class="nm">(d)</span><p><span class="cl">(R. Yosi):</span> One may even immerse after Minchah, in order to recite Ne'ilah since, in his opinion, the time for Ne'ilah is  <i>before</i> night (not like Rav).</p></div>
<div class="indent1"><span class="nm">(e)</span><p><span class="cl">Question:</span> But in a second Beraisa, the Rabanan and R. Yosi seem to have switched positions!?</p></div>
<div class="indent1"><span class="nm">(f)</span><p><span class="cl">Answer:</span> The second Beraisa (wherein R. Yosi forbids a Ba'al Keri to immerse after Minchah) speaks when the Tamei man has already recited Ne'ilah.</p></div>
<div class="indent1"><span class="nm">(g)</span><p><span class="cl">Question:</span> If he has already recited Ne'ilah, then why do the Rabanan permit his Tevilah?</p></div>
<div class="indent1"><span class="nm">(h)</span><p><span class="cl">Answer:</span> They hold that it is always a Mitzvah to immerse as soon as it falls due (and for a Ba'al Keri it falls due by day).</p></div>
<div class="indent1"><span class="nm">(i)</span><p><span class="cl">Question:</span> Are we to then infer that R. Yosi does <i>not</i> hold of such a Mitzvah!?</p></div>
<div class="indent2"><span class="nm">1.</span><p>The Beraisa discusses the case of a person with the Name of Hash-m written on his skin.</p></div>
<div class="indent2"><span class="nm">2.</span><p>R. Yosi permits his immersion (even without a bull-rush tied around it) - because of 'Tevilah bi'Zemanah Mitzvah'.</p></div>
<div class="indent1"><span class="nm">(j)</span><p><span class="cl">Answer:</span> The first R. Yosi is R. Yosi b'R. Yehudah and the second one is the more commonly known R. Yosi b. Chalafta.</p></div>
<div class="indent1"><span class="nm">(k)</span><p>This is supported by the Beraisa in which R. Yosi b'R. Yehudah expressly is lenient regarding Tevilah bi'Zeman.</p></div>
<div class="subject"><span class="nm">2)</span><p>ONE WHO SEES KERI ON YOM KIPUR</p></div>
<div class="indent1"><span class="nm">(a)</span><p>The Tana of a Beraisa permits someone who sees Keri on Yom Kipur to immerse immediately (without washing off the dirt), adding that he will wash it at night.</p></div>
<div class="indent1"><span class="nm">(b)</span><p><span class="cl">Question:</span> Of what value is washing at night, after Tevilah!?</p></div>
<div class="indent1"><span class="nm">(c)</span><p><span class="cl">Answer:</span> We amend this to teach that everyone should bathe on Erev Yom Kipur, to remove any potential Chatzitzah, in case he sees Keri on Yom Kipur and needs to immerse.</p></div>
<div class="indent1"><span class="nm">(d)</span><p>It was taught before R. Nachman that seeing Keri on Yom Kipur is a sign that all his sins are forgiven.</p></div>
<div class="indent1"><span class="nm">(e)</span><p><span class="cl">Question:</span> But a Beraisa teaches that his Aveiros are Sedurin (apparently meaning lined up for judgement)!?</p></div>
<div class="indent1"><span class="nm">(f)</span><p><span class="cl">Answer:</span> Sedurin means arranged for forgiveness.</p></div>
<div class="indent1"><span class="nm">(g)</span><p><span class="cl">(Tana of Bei R. Yishmael):</span> He should worry the entire year (lest his <i>Inuy</i> is being thrown back at him).</p></div>
<div class="indent1"><span class="nm">(h)</span><p>If he lives out the year, however, he is assured of going to Olam ha'Ba (his great merit is protecting him).</p></div>
<div class="indent1"><span class="nm">(i)</span><p><span class="cl">(R. Nachman b. Yitzhok):</span> This is evident from the fact that in spite of that, when everybody else was 'hungry', he was forced to be 'satisfied', he thus survived the year without affliction, which could only be said of a complete Tzadik.</p></div>
<div class="indent1"><span class="nm">(j)</span><p><span class="cl">(R. Dimi):</span> One who sees Keri on Yom Kipur will live long and have many children and grandchildren.</p></div>
