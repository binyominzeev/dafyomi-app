<div class="subject"><span class="nm">1)</span><p>HOW WE LEARN TO MATZAH</p></div>
<div class="indent1"><span class="nm">(a)</span><p><span class="cl">(Beraisa):</span> "Tihyenah" (teaches that 10 Esronim are used for the Chametz of Lachmei Todah).</p></div>
<div class="indent1"><span class="nm">(b)</span><p><span class="cl">Question:</span> How do we learn from this?</p></div>
<div class="indent1"><span class="nm">(c)</span><p><span class="cl">Answer (R. Yitzchak bar Avodimi):</span> It is written with an extra Yud. (This hints at 10 Esronim. The Torah explicitly says that that Shtei ha'Lechem are two Esronim, so we use this to teach about the Chametz of Lachmei Todah.)</p></div>
<div class="indent1"><span class="nm">(d)</span><p><span class="cl">Question:</span> Perhaps it teaches that 10 Kefizim (a smaller measure) are used!</p></div>
<div class="indent1"><span class="nm">(e)</span><p><span class="cl">Answer (Rava):</span> The verse discusses Esronim.</p></div>
<div class="indent1"><span class="nm">(f)</span><p><span class="cl">(Beraisa) Question:</span> This teaches that 10 are used for the Chametz. What is the source for the Matzah?</p></div>
<div class="indent2"><span class="nm">1.</span><p><span class="cl">Answer:</span> "Al Chalos Lechem Chametz" - the Matzah has as much flour as the Chametz.</p></div>
<div class="indent1"><span class="nm">(g)</span><p><span class="cl">Question:</span> ("Tavi'u" taught that whatever you bring similar to Shtei ha'Lechem (i.e. Chametz) is also one Isaron per loaf. In Kodshim,) something (e.g. Chametz) learned from a Hekesh (from Shtei ha'Lechem) cannot teach to something else (Matzah) through a Hekesh!</p></div>
<div class="indent1"><span class="nm">(h)</span><p><span class="cl">Version #1 - Answer #1:</span> This is a case of a Hekesh and something else. (Tosfos - the Shi'ur of Chametz is not learned entirely from a Hekesh. We also needed "Tihyenah". Alternatively, the Hekesh taught only the size of each loaf. The number of loaves was learned from Terumas Ma'aser through a Gezerah Shavah. Alternatively, Terumas Ma'aser is Chulin, and we may learn Hekesh mi'Hekesh from Chulin. Rashi - the matter learned from a Hekesh (one Isaron per loaf) is not what is taught through another Hekesh, i.e. the amount of Soles in all the loaves together.)</p></div>
<div class="indent1"><span class="nm">(i)</span><p><span class="cl">Version #2 - Rashi - Answer #1:</span> Is this a case of a Hekesh teaching about something else?! (It teaches about another part of the same Korban!) (end of Version #2)</p></div>
<div class="indent2"><span class="nm">1.</span><p>Therefore, it is not considered a Hekesh (to prevent learning Hekesh mi'Hekesh).</p></div>
<div class="indent1"><span class="nm">(j)</span><p><span class="cl">Question:</span> This is like the opinion that a Hekesh and something else is not considered a Hekesh;</p></div>
<div class="indent2"><span class="nm">1.</span><p>According to the opinion that it is, how can we answer?</p></div>
<div class="indent1"><span class="nm">(k)</span><p><span class="cl">Answer #2:</span> "Tavi'u" is not needed to teach about Shtei ha'Lechem. It was written solely to teach about Todah, so we do not consider Todah to be learned from a Hekesh.</p></div>
<div class="subject"><span class="nm">2)</span><p>THE MILU'IM</p></div>
<div class="indent1"><span class="nm">(a)</span><p><span class="cl">(Mishnah):</span> The Milu'im breads were of the three varieties of Matzah found in Todah, i.e. Chalos, Rekikim and Revichah;</p></div>
<div class="indent1"><span class="nm">(b)</span><p>Lachmei Nazir are two of the three varieties of Matzah found in Todah, Chalos and Rekikim, but not Revichah;</p></div>
<div class="indent1"><span class="nm">(c)</span><p>Lachmei Nazir consist of 10 Yerushalmi Kavim. This equals six Esronim and a fraction (two thirds of an Isaron).</p></div>
<div class="indent1"><span class="nm">(d)</span><p><span class="cl">(Gemara) Question:</span> What is the source of this?</p></div>
<div class="indent1"><span class="nm">(e)</span><p><span class="cl">Answer #1 (Rav Chisda):</span> "Umi'Sal ha'Matzos Asher Lifnei Hash-m Lakach Chalas Matzah Achas v'Chalas Lechem Shemen Achas v'Rakik Echad."</p></div>
<div class="indent2"><span class="nm">1.</span><p><span class="cl">Question:</span> Clearly, "Chalah" and "Rakik" are just like we find in Lachmei Todah. What is "Chalas Lechem Shemen Achas"?</p></div>
<div class="indent2"><span class="nm">2.</span><p><span class="cl">Suggestion:</span> This is Revuchah. (It is called 'Lechem Shemen' because it has more oil than Chalos or Rekikim.)</p></div>
<div class="indent1"><span class="nm">(f)</span><p><span class="cl">Objection (Rav Avya):</span> Perhaps it is a cake of congealed oil! (Alternatively - it is a thick piece of dough fried in oil!)</p></div>
<div class="indent1"><span class="nm">(g)</span><p>Answer #2 (Rav Nachman bar Rav Chisda) Question: How do we understand "Zeh Korban Aharon u'Vanav Asher Yakrivu la'Shem b'Yom Himashach Oso"? This connotes that Aharon's sons bring a Korban due to their father's anointment!</p></div>
<div class="indent2"><span class="nm">1.</span><p><span class="cl">Answer:</span> This equates a regular Kohen's Minchas Chinuch (that he brings the first time he does Avodah) to the Minchah a Kohen Gadol brings upon being anointed (and every day afterwards, i.e. Chavitim), i.e. Revuchah.</p></div>
<div class="indent1"><span class="nm">(h)</span><p><span class="cl">(Rav Chisda):</span> When a Kohen Gadol is anointed, he brings two Menachos. Each is one Isaron. One is due to anointment, and one is his Chinuch (for his first Avodah as Kohen Gadol).</p></div>
<div class="indent1"><span class="nm">(i)</span><p><span class="cl">(Mar bar Rav Ashi):</span> He brings three.</p></div>
<div class="indent1"><span class="nm">(j)</span><p>They do not argue. Rav Chisda discusses a Kohen who previously served as a Hedyot. Mar bar Rav Ashi discusses one who never served before (so he must bring also Minchas Chinuch of a regular Kohen).</p></div>
<div class="indent1"><span class="nm">(k)</span><p><span class="cl">(Mishnah):</span> Lachmei Nazir are two of the three varieties of Matzah in Todah.</p></div>
<div class="indent1"><span class="nm">(l)</span><p><span class="cl">(Beraisa):</span> "Shelamav" (written regarding Todah) includes Eil Nazir. Its breads resemble Lachmei Todah. They consist of 10 Yerushalmi Kavim of Soles and a quarter Log of oil;</p></div>
<div class="indent2"><span class="nm">1.</span><p><span class="cl">Suggestion:</span> Perhaps this teaches that all three kinds of Matzah in Lachmei Todah are brought!</p></div>
<div class="indent2"><span class="nm">2.</span><p><span class="cl">Rejection:</span> It says "Matzos".</p></div>
<div class="indent2"><span class="nm">3.</span><p><span class="cl">Question:</span> How do we learn this from the verse?</p></div>
<div class="indent2"><span class="nm">4.</span><p><span class="cl">Answer #1 (Rav Papa):</span> We include those Lachmei Todah regarding which it says "Matzos". It does not say "Matzos" regarding Revuchah.</p></div>
<div class="indent2"><span class="nm">5.</span><p><span class="cl">Answer #2 (Tana d'Vei R. Yishmael):</span> "Matzos" is a Klal, and "Chalos" and "Rakikei" are Pratim. From a Klal and Prat we only learn the Pratim, i.e. Chalos and Rekikim.</p></div>

<div class="subject"><span class="nm">3)</span><p>SHECHITAH IS MEKADESH THE BREAD</p></div>
<div class="indent1"><span class="nm">(a)</span><p><span class="cl">(Mishnah):</span> If Lachmei Todah were outside the wall (this will be explained) when the Todah was slaughtered inside, the bread is not Mekudash;</p></div>
<div class="indent1"><span class="nm">(b)</span><p>If at the time of Shechitah the bread had not yet formed a crust in the oven, even if only one of the loaves did not have a crust, the bread is not Mekudash.</p></div>
<div class="indent1"><span class="nm">(c)</span><p><span class="cl">(Gemara) Question:</span> What is the meaning of 'outside the wall'?</p></div>
<div class="indent1"><span class="nm">(d)</span><p><span class="cl">Answer #1 (R. Yochanan):</span> It means, outside the wall of Beis Pagi. (Rashi Kesav Yad - outside of Yerushalayim; Rambam - outside of Har ha'Bayis.)</p></div>
<div class="indent1"><span class="nm">(e)</span><p><span class="cl">Answer #2 (Reish Lakish):</span> It was outside the wall of the Azarah.</p></div>
<div class="indent1"><span class="nm">(f)</span><p>(Todah must be slaughtered "Al Chalos Lechem Chametz.")</p></div>
<div class="indent1"><span class="nm">(g)</span><p>Reish Lakish holds that "Al" connotes nearby. Therefore, if the bread was outside of the Azarah, it does not become Kodesh;</p></div>
<div class="indent1"><span class="nm">(h)</span><p>R. Yochanan says that if it was outside Beis Pagi does not become Kodesh, but if it was within Beis Pagi, even though it was outside of the Azarah, it becomes Kodesh. "Al" does not connote nearby.</p></div>
<div class="indent1"><span class="nm">(i)</span><p><span class="cl">Question:</span> They argued about this elsewhere!</p></div>
<div class="indent2"><span class="nm">1.</span><p><span class="cl">(Mishnah):</span> A Lav ("Lo Sizbach Al Chametz Dam Zivchi") forbids slaughtering Korban Pesach before eradicating Chametz;</p></div>
<div class="indent2"><span class="nm">2.</span><p>R. Yehudah says, the Lav also applies to slaughtering the Tamid (on the afternoon of Erev Pesach).</p></div>
<div class="indent2"><span class="nm">3.</span><p><span class="cl">(Reish Lakish):</span> He is not liable unless there was Chametz in the Azarah belonging to the slaughterer, the one who did Zerikah, or an owner of the Korban;</p></div>
<div class="indent2"><span class="nm">4.</span><p><span class="cl">(R. Yochanan):</span> He is liable even if the Chametz was not in the Azarah.</p></div>
<div class="indent1"><span class="nm">(j)</span><p><span class="cl">Answer:</span> They needed to teach their argument in both cases:</p></div>
<div class="indent2"><span class="nm">1.</span><p>Had they taught only about slaughtering, one might have thought that there R. Yochanan does not require the Chametz to be nearby, for one transgresses (Bal Yera'eh and Bal Yimatzei) wherever the Chametz is, but Lachmei Todah must be in the Azarah;</p></div>
<div class="indent2"><span class="nm">2.</span><p>Had they taught only about Lachmei Todah, one might have thought that there Reish Lakish requires them to be nearby, but he would agree that "Lo Sizbach" applies even if the Chametz is far away, for wherever it is, one transgresses.</p></div>
<div class="indent1"><span class="nm">(k)</span><p><span class="cl">Support (for R. Yochanan - Beraisa):</span> If Todah was slaughtered inside, and the bread was outside the wall of Beis Pagi, the bread is not Mekudash.</p></div>
<div class="indent1"><span class="nm">(l)</span><p><span class="cl">(Mishnah):</span> If at the time of Shechitah the bread had not yet formed a crust in the oven...</p></div>
<div class="indent1"><span class="nm">(m)</span><p><span class="cl">Question:</span> What is the source of this?</p></div>
<div class="indent1"><span class="nm">(n)</span><p><span class="cl">Answer (Beraisa):</span> "Al Chalos Lechem Chametz Yakriv Korbano Al Zevach" teaches that it must be bread (i.e. a crust must have formed) at the time of Shechitah;</p></div>
<div class="indent2"><span class="nm">1.</span><p>"Yakriv Korbano Al Zevach" teaches that only Shechitah is Mekadesh the bread;</p></div>
<div class="indent2"><span class="nm">2.</span><p>"Zevach Todas" - if the Shechitah was not Lishmah (l'Shem Todah), the bread is not Mekudash.</p></div>
<div class="indent1"><span class="nm">(o)</span><p><span class="cl">(Beraisa):</span> One is Yotzei (eating Matzah on the first night of Pesach) with Matzah that is Na (this will be explained), or with Matzah baked in a pan.</p></div>
<div class="indent1"><span class="nm">(p)</span><p><span class="cl">Question:</span> What does Na mean? (Surely, it is not (fully) raw. This is not Lechem Oni!)</p></div>
<div class="indent1"><span class="nm">(q)</span><p><span class="cl">Answer (Rav Yehudah):</span> (It is partially cooked;) if one cuts it, strands do not extend from one side to the other. (Tosfos - this is the same degree of baking as forming a crust.)</p></div>
<div class="indent1"><span class="nm">(r)</span><p><span class="cl">(Rava):</span> The same applies to Lachmei Todah.</p></div>
<div class="indent1"><span class="nm">(s)</span><p><span class="cl">Question:</span> This is obvious! Both of these are called 'Lechem'.</p></div>
<div class="indent1"><span class="nm">(t)</span><p><span class="cl">Answer:</span> One might have thought that minimally baked loaves that can fall apart are considered to be broken, and this is invalid for Lachmei Todah, since "Echad" teaches that that a full loaf must be taken (from each kind, for Terumah);</p></div>
<div class="indent2"><span class="nm">1.</span><p>Rava teaches that this is not so.</p></div>

<div class="indent1"><span class="nm">(a)</span><p><span class="cl">(Chizkiyah):</span> If a Todah was slaughtered for 80 loaves, 40 of them become Kodesh;</p></div>
<div class="indent1"><span class="nm">(b)</span><p><span class="cl">(R. Yochanan):</span> None of them become Kodesh.</p></div>
