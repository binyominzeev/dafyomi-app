<div class="subject"><span class="nm">1)</span><p>THE <i>MACHANOS</i> IN <i>SHILO</i></p></div>
<div class="indent1"><span class="nm">(a)</span><p><span class="cl">(Beraisa - R. Shimon):</span> There was a fourth Machaneh, Ezras Nashim. One who entered b'Tum'ah was not punished;</p></div>
<div class="indent1"><span class="nm">(b)</span><p>In Shilo there were only two Machanos.</p></div>
<div class="indent1"><span class="nm">(c)</span><p><span class="cl">Question:</span> Which of the three was missing?</p></div>
<div class="indent1"><span class="nm">(d)</span><p><span class="cl">Answer (Rabah):</span> Presumably, Machaneh Levi was not missing, for this is the only Machaneh separating a Zav and a Tamei Mes (a Zav is forbidden there, a Tamei Mes is permitted);</p></div>
<div class="indent2"><span class="nm">1.</span><p>It says "v'Lo Yetam'u Es <i>Machaneihem</i>", i.e. they are expelled from different camps!</p></div>
<div class="indent1"><span class="nm">(e)</span><p><span class="cl">Objection (Rava):</span> If so, you must say that Machaneh Yisrael was missing. If so, Zavim and Metzora'im are expelled from the same camps;</p></div>
<div class="indent2"><span class="nm">1.</span><p>It says "Badad Yeshev" - other Teme'im may not be with a Metzora!</p></div>
<div class="indent1"><span class="nm">(f)</span><p><span class="cl">Answer:</span> Really, there were all three Machanos;</p></div>
<div class="indent2"><span class="nm">1.</span><p>The Beraisa means that in Shilo there were only two Machanos regarding Klitah. (I.e. one Machaneh (Levi) was 'Chaser', i.e. it was not a refuge for Shogeg murderers.)</p></div>
<div class="indent1"><span class="nm">(g)</span><p><span class="cl">Inference:</span> In the Midbar, Machaneh Levi was Kolet!</p></div>
<div class="indent1"><span class="nm">(h)</span><p><span class="cl">Affirmation:</span> Yes!</p></div>
<div class="indent2"><span class="nm">1.</span><p><span class="cl">(Beraisa):</span> "V'Samti <i>Lecha</i> Makom" - there will be a place of refuge in your (Moshe's) lifetime;</p></div>
<div class="indent2"><span class="nm">2.</span><p>"Lecha Makom" - it will be your place (Moshe was in Machaneh Levi).</p></div>
<div class="indent2"><span class="nm">3.</span><p>"Asher Yanus Shamah" - this teaches that exile applied in the Midbar.</p></div>
<div class="indent2"><span class="nm">4.</span><p><span class="cl">Question:</span> Where did Shogeg murderers go?</p></div>
<div class="indent2"><span class="nm">5.</span><p><span class="cl">Answer:</span> They went to Machaneh Levi;</p></div>
<div class="indent3"><span class="nm">i.</span><p>If a Levi murdered b'Shogeg, he was exiled to a different neighborhood in Machaneh Levi. If he was exiled to a different part of his own neighborhood, he received refuge.</p></div>
<div class="indent2"><span class="nm">6.</span><p><span class="cl">Question:</span> What is the source of this?</p></div>
<div class="indent2"><span class="nm">7.</span><p><span class="cl">Answer (Rav Acha brei d'Rav Ika):</span> "Ki v'Ir <i>Miklato</i> Yeshev" (he has refuge even) in the city that already absorbed him (he was already living there.)</p></div>
<div class="subject"><span class="nm">2)</span><p>DIFFERENCES BETWEEN THE <i>MIDBAR</i> AND <i>GILGAL</i></p></div>
<div class="indent1"><span class="nm">(a)</span><p><span class="cl">(Mishnah):</span> When they came to Gilgal...</p></div>
<div class="indent1"><span class="nm">(b)</span><p><span class="cl">(Beraisa):</span> Only Nedarim and Nedavos may be offered on a Bamah;</p></div>
<div class="indent1"><span class="nm">(c)</span><p>R. Meir says, Menachos and (Korbanos of) Nezirus may be offered;</p></div>
<div class="indent1"><span class="nm">(d)</span><p>Chachamim say, individuals offered only Olos and Shelamim.</p></div>
<div class="indent1"><span class="nm">(e)</span><p>R. Yehudah says, anything that the Tzibur and an individual could bring in the Ohel Mo'ed in the Midbar, they could bring in the Ohel Mo'ed in Gilgal;</p></div>
<div class="indent2"><span class="nm">1.</span><p>The difference between them was that Bamos were permitted when the Ohel Mo'ed was in the Midbar, but they were forbidden when it was in Gilgal;</p></div>
<div class="indent2"><span class="nm">2.</span><p>One could offer only Nedarim and Nedavos on a Bamah on top of his roof (i.e. a private Bamah).</p></div>
<div class="indent1"><span class="nm">(f)</span><p>Chachamim say, anything the Tzibur brought in the Ohel Mo'ed in the Midbar, it brought in the Ohel Mo'ed in Gilgal;</p></div>
<div class="indent2"><span class="nm">1.</span><p>In both of them, individuals offered only Olos and Shelamim.</p></div>
<div class="indent1"><span class="nm">(g)</span><p>R. Shimon says, even the Tzibur offered only Pesach and Chovos (obligatory offerings) that have a fixed time.</p></div>
<div class="bbbline">117b----------------------------------------117b</p></div>
<div class="indent1"><span class="nm">(h)</span><p><span class="cl">Question:</span> What is R. Meir's reason?</p></div>
<div class="indent1"><span class="nm">(i)</span><p><span class="cl">Answer:</span> "Lo Sa'asun k'Chol Asher Anachnu Osim Po ha'Yom" - Moshe told Yisrael 'when you come to Eretz Yisrael, you may offer Yashrus ("Kol ha'Yashar b'Einav", i.e. Nedarim and Nedavos, which are voluntary), but not Chovos';</p></div>
<div class="indent2"><span class="nm">1.</span><p>Menachos and Nezirus are voluntary.</p></div>
<div class="indent1"><span class="nm">(j)</span><p>Chachamim hold that Menachos may not be offered on a Bamah, and (Korbanos) Nezirus are obligatory (a Nazir must bring them).</p></div>
<div class="indent1"><span class="nm">(k)</span><p><span class="cl">(Shmuel):</span> They argue about Chatas and Asham (of a Nazir), but all agree that Olos and Shelamim are Yashrus, so they may be offered.</p></div>
<div class="indent1"><span class="nm">(l)</span><p><span class="cl">Objection (Rava - Beraisa):</span> The following gifts to the Kohen apply on a Bamah Gedolah, but not on a Bamah Ketanah:</p></div>
<div class="indent2"><span class="nm">1.</span><p>Chazeh v'Shok (the chest and thigh of Shelamim) and Terumas (one bread of each of the four kinds of) Lachmei Todah.</p></div>
<div class="indent2"><span class="nm">2.</span><p>The Beraisa omits the Zero'a Beshelah (the cooked foreleg of a Nazir's Shelamim).</p></div>
<div class="indent2"><span class="nm">3.</span><p>Granted, if they argue (even) about Olah and Shelamim, the Beraisa is like Chachamim, who say that no Korbanos Nazir are offered on a Bamah;</p></div>
<div class="indent3"><span class="nm">i.</span><p>However, if they argue only about Chatas and Asham, why was this omitted?</p></div>
<div class="indent1"><span class="nm">(m)</span><p><span class="cl">Correction:</span> Rather, Shmuel taught that they argue about Olah and Shelamim (of a Nazir), but all agree that Chatas and Asham are Chovos, so they may not be offered.</p></div>
<div class="indent1"><span class="nm">(n)</span><p><span class="cl">(Beraisa - Chachamim):</span> Anything the Tzibur brought in the Ohel... (in the Midbar and Gilgal, individuals only offered Olos and Shelamim).</p></div>
<div class="indent1"><span class="nm">(o)</span><p><span class="cl">Question:</span> What is Chachamim's reason?</p></div>
<div class="indent1"><span class="nm">(p)</span><p><span class="cl">Answer:</span> "Ish ha'Yashar b'Einav"- they offered Yashrus, but not Chovos;</p></div>
<div class="indent2"><span class="nm">1.</span><p>The Tzibur brought even Chovos.</p></div>
