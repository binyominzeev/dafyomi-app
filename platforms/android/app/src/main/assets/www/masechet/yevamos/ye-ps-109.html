<p class="bas subject"><span class="nm">1)</span>MACHAZIR GERUSHASO</p>
<p class="bas indent1"><span class="nm">(a)</span><span class="cl">(Mishnah):</span> If one divorced his wife and remarried her, she may do Yibum when he dies;</p>
<p class="bas indent1"><span class="nm">(b)</span>R. Elazar forbids.</p>
<p class="bas indent1"><span class="nm">(c)</span>Similarly, if one divorced an orphaned minor and remarried her, she may do Yibum;</p>
<p class="bas indent1"><span class="nm">(d)</span>R. Elazar forbids.</p>
<p class="bas indent1"><span class="nm">(e)</span>If a father married off his minor daughter and she was divorced, she is like an orphan in the life of her father. If her ex-husband remarries her, all agree that she may not do Yibum.</p>
<p class="bas indent1"><span class="nm">(f)</span><span class="cl">(Gemara) Question:</span> What is R. Elazar's reason?</p>
<p class="bas indent1"><span class="nm">(g)</span><span class="cl">Answer #1 (Eifa):</span> Because she was once forbidden to the Yavam (when she was divorced, she is always forbidden).</p>
<p class="bas indent1"><span class="nm">(h)</span><span class="cl">Objection (Rabanan):</span> If so, Chalitzah should not be required!</p>
<p class="bas indent2"><span class="nm">1.</span><span class="cl">Suggestion:</span> Perhaps this is true!</p>
<p class="bas indent2"><span class="nm">2.</span><span class="cl">Rejection (Beraisa - R. Elazar):</span> She does Chalitzah.</p>
<p class="bas indent1"><span class="nm">(i)</span><span class="cl">Retraction (Eifah):</span> I was wrong. I do not know his reason.</p>
<p class="bas indent1"><span class="nm">(j)</span><span class="cl">Answer #2 (Abaye):</span> R. Elazar is unsure whether death is Mapil (makes her fall to Yibum), or the beginning of the marriage is Mapil;</p>
<p class="bas indent2"><span class="nm">1.</span>If death is Mapil, she may do Yibum (at the time there is no Isur);</p>
<p class="bas indent2"><span class="nm">2.</span>If the beginning of the marriage is Mapil, Yibum is forbidden (for she was forbidden beforehand).</p>
<p class="bas indent1"><span class="nm">(k)</span><span class="cl">Answer #3 (Rava):</span> Really, R. Elazar is sure that death is Mapil. Rather, everyone knows about the divorce, but not everyone knows that he remarried her. (If she did Yibum, people would think that she merely marries the brother of her ex-husband, which is forbidden.)</p>
<p class="bas indent1"><span class="nm">(l)</span><span class="cl">Question:</span> To the contrary! When he remarries her, there is publicity!</p>
<p class="bas indent1"><span class="nm">(m)</span><span class="cl">Answer:</span> Perhaps he will remarry her at night and die the next morning.</p>
<p class="bas indent1"><span class="nm">(n)</span><span class="cl">Answer #4 (Rav Ashi):</span> R. Elazar decrees in the first two cases of the Mishnah lest she be confused with an 'orphan in the life of her father'.</p>
<p class="bas indent1"><span class="nm">(o)</span><span class="cl">Support (Seifa):</span> If a father married off his daughter as a minor, and she was divorced, she is like an orphan in the life of her father. If he remarries her, all agree that she may not do Yibum.</p>
<p class="bas indent2"><span class="nm">1.</span><span class="cl">Question:</span> This is obvious! (Mid'Oraisa she was divorced and did not remarry him!)</p>
<p class="bas indent2"><span class="nm">2.</span><span class="cl">Answer:</span> Rather, the Seifa was taught solely to teach that this is why R. Elazar forbids in the Reisha.</p>
<p class="bas indent1"><span class="nm">(p)</span><span class="cl">Support (Beraisa):</span> Chachamim admit to R. Elazar about a minor who was married off by her father and divorced. She is like an orphan in the life of her father. If he remarries her she cannot do Yibum, because her divorce is a full divorce, but her remarriage is not full marriage;</p>
<p class="bas indent2"><span class="nm">1.</span>This is when he divorced and remarried her when she was a minor. If he divorced her when she was a minor and remarried her when she was an adult, or remarried her when she was a minor and she matured before he died, she does Yibum or Chalitzah;</p>
<p class="bas indent2"><span class="nm">2.</span>R. Elazar says, she must do Chalitzah.</p>
<p class="bas indent1"><span class="nm">(q)</span><span class="cl">Question (Rava):</span> What is the law of her Tzarah?</p>
<p class="bas indent1"><span class="nm">(r)</span><span class="cl">Answer (Rav Nachman):</span> She is forbidden to do Yibum only due to a decree. Will we decree to forbid the Tzarah lest one transgress a decree?!</p>
<p class="bas indent1"><span class="nm">(s)</span><span class="cl">Question (Beraisa - R. Elazar):</span> She and her Tzarah do Chalitzah.</p>
<p class="bas indent2"><span class="nm">1.</span><span class="cl">Objection:</span> Surely, we do not require that both do Chalitzah!</p>
<p class="bas indent2"><span class="nm">2.</span><span class="cl">Correction:</span> Rather, she or her Tzarah does Chalitzah.</p>
<p class="bas indent1"><span class="nm">(t)</span><span class="cl">Answer:</span> Since the Beraisa must be amended, we can amend it thusly: she may do only Chalitzah; her Tzarah may do Chalitzah or Yibum.</p>
<p class="bas subject"><span class="nm">2)</span><i>ZIKAH</i> OF A GIRL MARRIED <i>MID'RABANAN</i></p>
<p class="bas indent1"><span class="nm">(a)</span><span class="cl">(Mishnah):</span> Two brothers were married to two sisters who are (orphaned) minors; one brother died. His wife is exempt from Yibum and Chalitzah due to her sister. (The same applies if the sisters are deaf - the Gra deletes this from the text.)</p>
<p class="bas indent1"><span class="nm">(b)</span>If one sister is an adult and the other a minor:</p>
<p class="bas indent2"><span class="nm">1.</span>If the minor's husband died, she is exempt from Yibum and Chalitzah because she is Achos Ishto to the Yavam;</p>
<p class="bas indent1"><span class="nm">(c)</span>If the adult's husband died:</p>
<p class="bas indent2"><span class="nm">1.</span>R. Eliezer says, we counsel the minor to do Mi'un (and her sister does Yibum);</p>
<p class="bas indent2"><span class="nm">2.</span>R. Gamliel says, if she does Mi'un on her own, fine. If not, she waits (to have Bi'ah) until she grows up, and then her older sister is exempt from Yibum and Chalitzah;</p>
<p class="bas indent2"><span class="nm">3.</span>R. Yehoshua says, woe to him for his wife, woe to him for his brother's wife! He divorces his wife, and does Chalitzah to his Yevamah.</p>
<p class="bas subject"><span class="nm">3)</span>THINGS TO EMBRACE AND AVOID</p>
<p class="bas indent1"><span class="nm">(a)</span><span class="cl">(Gemara) Question:</span> We do not encourage Mi'un!</p>
<p class="bas indent2"><span class="nm">1.</span><span class="cl">(Bar Kapara):</span> A person should always cling to three things - Chalitzah, bringing Shalom, and permitting vows;</p>
<p class="bas indent2"><span class="nm">2.</span>One should distance himself from three things - Mi'un, deposits, and being a guarantor.</p>
<p class="bas indent1"><span class="nm">(b)</span><span class="cl">Answer:</span> For a Mitzvah, one may encourage Mi'un.</p>
<p class="bas indent1"><span class="nm">(c)</span>Bar Kapara taught that a person should always cling to Chalitzah. This is like Aba Sha'ul:</p>
<p class="bas indent2"><span class="nm">1.</span><span class="cl">(Beraisa - Aba Sha'ul):</span> If one does Yibum because the Yevamah is attractive, or to be married, or for another reason, it is as if he has Bi'ah with Ervah. I consider the child to be almost a Mamzer.</p>
<p class="bas indent1"><span class="nm">(d)</span>One should cling to bringing Shalom - "Seek Shalom and pursue it";</p>
<p class="bas bbbline">109b----------------------------------------109b</p>
<p class="bas indent2"><span class="nm">1.</span><span class="cl">(R. Avahu):</span> We learn a Gezeirah Shavah 'Rodef-Rodef'. It says here "Bakesh Shalom v'Rodfehu", and it says "Rodef Tzedakah v'Chesed Yimtza Chayim Tzedakah v'Chavod."</p>
<p class="bas indent1"><span class="nm">(e)</span>One should cling to permitting vows, like R. Noson taught:</p>
<p class="bas indent2"><span class="nm">1.</span><span class="cl">(R. Noson):</span> One who vows is like one who builds a private Mizbe'ach (when this is forbidden). If he fulfills his vow, it is as if he offered a Korban on his private Mizbe'ach,</p>
<p class="bas indent1"><span class="nm">(f)</span>One should avoid Mi'un, lest she regret it when she grows up;</p>
<p class="bas indent1"><span class="nm">(g)</span>One should avoid deposits from one who lives in the same city, for the depositor is often in the Shomer's house (perhaps he will take back his deposit, and later claim it from him).</p>
<p class="bas indent1"><span class="nm">(h)</span>One should avoid being a guarantor, like guarantors of Shaltziyon:</p>
<p class="bas indent2"><span class="nm">1.</span><span class="cl">(R. Yitzchak):</span> "Ra Yero'a Ki Arev Zar" - evil after evil will come upon those that accept converts, guarantors of Shaltziyon, and Toke'a Atzmo li'Dvar`Halachah (this will be explained).</p>
<p class="bas indent2"><span class="nm">2.</span>One who accepts converts is liable, like R. Chelbo taught;</p>
<p class="bas indent3"><span class="nm">i.</span><span class="cl">(R. Chelbo):</span> Converts are like problematic for Yisrael like Tzara'as in the skin.</p>
<p class="bas indent2"><span class="nm">3.</span>Guarantors of Shaltziyon suffer, for the lender bypasses the borrower and claims immediately from the guarantor.</p>
<p class="bas indent1"><span class="nm">(i)</span>The following teaches about Toke'a Atzmo li'Dvar Halachah.</p>
<p class="bas indent1"><span class="nm">(j)</span><span class="cl">Explanation #1 (Beraisa - R. Yosi):</span> If one says that he does not have Torah, he does not have Torah.</p>
<p class="bas indent1"><span class="nm">(k)</span><span class="cl">Objection:</span> This is obvious!</p>
<p class="bas indent1"><span class="nm">(l)</span><span class="cl">Correction:</span> Rather, anyone who says that he has only Torah, has only Torah.</p>
<p class="bas indent1"><span class="nm">(m)</span><span class="cl">Objection:</span> Also this is obvious!</p>
<p class="bas indent1"><span class="nm">(n)</span><span class="cl">Answer #1:</span> Rather, he does not have even Torah;</p>
<p class="bas indent2"><span class="nm">1.</span><span class="cl">(Rav Papa):</span> "You will learn and you will do" - only one who fulfills Torah can learn it.</p>
<p class="bas indent1"><span class="nm">(o)</span><span class="cl">Answer #2:</span> Really, he has only Torah. R. Yosi teaches about one who teaches others, and they fulfill what they learn from him;</p>
<p class="bas indent2"><span class="nm">1.</span>One might have thought that he gets reward for this. R. Yosi teaches that he does not.</p>
<p class="bas indent1"><span class="nm">(p)</span><span class="cl">Explanation #2:</span> Toke'a Atzmo li'Dvar Halachah refers to a judge presiding over a case that slightly resembles a Halachah he has learned (and he applies the law here). Even though he has a Rebbi, he does not ask him;</p>
<p class="bas indent2"><span class="nm">1.</span><span class="cl">(Rav Shmuel bar Nachmani):</span> A judge should view himself as if a sword is between his thighs, and Gehenom is open beneath him. "Shishim Giborim ... mi'Pachad ba'Lailos" - the judges fear Gehenom, which is like night.</p>
<p class="bas subject"><span class="nm">4)</span>ONE WHO WAS MARRIED <i>MID'RABANAN</i> TO HIS <i>YEVAMAH'S</i> SISTER</p>
<p class="bas indent1"><span class="nm">(a)</span><span class="cl">(Mishnah - R. Gamliel):</span> If she does Mi'un (if not, she waits until she grows up, and then her older sister is exempt).</p>
<p class="bas indent1"><span class="nm">(b)</span><span class="cl">Question (R. Elazar):</span> What is R. Gamliel's reason?</p>
<p class="bas indent2"><span class="nm">1.</span>Does he hold that Kidushin of a minor is tentative, and when she matures, her Kidushin matures (retroactively becomes mid'Oraisa) with her, even without Bi'ah (so her sister never fell to Yibum)?</p>
<p class="bas indent2"><span class="nm">2.</span>Or, does he hold that (now, a new act of) Kidushin of his Yevamah's sister exempts his Yevamah from Yibum and Chalitzah?</p>
<p class="bas indent3"><span class="nm">i.</span>This happens only through Bi'ah with his wife when she is an adult.</p>
<p class="bas indent1"><span class="nm">(c)</span><span class="cl">Answer (Rav):</span> He holds that Kidushin of Achos Yevimto Yevamah exempts his Yevamah. This is only through Bi'ah after she matures.</p>
<p class="bas indent1"><span class="nm">(d)</span><span class="cl">Objection (Rav Sheshes):</span> Rav must have been dozing when he said that!</p>
<p class="bas indent2"><span class="nm">1.</span><span class="cl">(Beraisa):</span> If one is Mekadesh a minor, the Kidushin is tentative.</p>
<p class="bas indent2"><span class="nm">2.</span><span class="cl">Suggestion:</span> This means that when she grows up, it becomes mid'Oraisa even without Bi'ah.</p>
<p class="bas indent1"><span class="nm">(e)</span><span class="cl">Answer (Ravin brei d'Rav Nachman):</span> No, the Kidushin is tentative: it becomes mid'Oraisa only if they have Bi'ah after she matures;</p>
<p class="bas indent2"><span class="nm">1.</span>She says, he has power over me (he can divorce me against my will), and I have power over him (I can do Mi'un against his will. Therefore, it is considered Safek Kidushin - Rashi. Ra'avad (brought in Sefer ha'Zechus) - Rav Sheshes accepted the answer, and said 'I used to think that I am better (wiser) than he (Ravin), but I see that he is (able to explain the Beraisa) better than I'.)</p>
