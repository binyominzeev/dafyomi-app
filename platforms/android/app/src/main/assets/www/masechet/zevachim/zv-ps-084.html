<div class="subject"><span class="nm">1)</span><p>DO WE TAKE DOWN <i>MENACHOS</i> AND <i>NESACHIM</i>?</p></div>
<div class="indent1"><span class="nm">(a)</span><p><span class="cl">(Reish Lakish):</span> All (Tana'im of our Mishnah) agree that if a Minchah (which is totally burned, e.g. Nedavah of Minchas Nesachim) is brought by itself, Lo Yered;</p></div>
<div class="indent2"><span class="nm">1.</span><p>R. Akiva and R. Yosi ha'Galili say that Yered;</p></div>
<div class="indent1"><span class="nm">(b)</span><p>If such a Minchah is brought with a Korban, R. Gamliel and R. Yehoshua say Lo Yered, and the others say Yered;</p></div>
<div class="indent1"><span class="nm">(c)</span><p>If a Nedavah of Nesachim (e.g. wine) is brought by itself,R. Gamliel and R. Shimon say Lo Yered, and the others say Yered;</p></div>
<div class="indent1"><span class="nm">(d)</span><p>If Nesachim are brought with a Korban, R. Gamliel says Lo Yered, and the others say Yered.</p></div>
<div class="indent1"><span class="nm">(e)</span><p><span class="cl">Objection:</span> All this is obvious!</p></div>
<div class="indent1"><span class="nm">(f)</span><p><span class="cl">Answer #1:</span> The Chidush is (in the first clause, i.e.) Rava's law.</p></div>
<div class="indent2"><span class="nm">1.</span><p><span class="cl">(Rava):</span> One may bring Minchas Nesachim (by itself) every day.</p></div>
<div class="indent1"><span class="nm">(g)</span><p><span class="cl">Objection:</span> If so, Reish Lakish should have taught only Rava's law!</p></div>
<div class="indent1"><span class="nm">(h)</span><p><span class="cl">Answer #2:</span> The Chidush is (in the last clause,) regarding Menachos and Nesachim brought with a Korban, when they are brought on a later day;</p></div>
<div class="indent2"><span class="nm">1.</span><p>"Minchasam... v'Niskeihem" - the Minchah and Nesech accompanying a Korban may be brought at night or the next day;</p></div>
<div class="indent2"><span class="nm">2.</span><p>One might have thought that when they are brought later, it is as if they are brought by themselves, and R. Shimon would say Lo Yered. Reish Lakish teaches that this is not so.</p></div>
<div class="subject"><span class="nm">2)</span><p>WHICH <i>PESULIM</i> ARE <i>BA'KODESH</i>?</p></div>
<div class="indent1"><span class="nm">(a)</span><p><span class="cl">(Mishnah):</span> If Kodesh became Pasul due to any of the following, if Alah, Lo Yered:</p></div>
<div class="indent2"><span class="nm">1.</span><p>Linah (it was not offered within the proper time), Yotzei (it left its permitted place), Tum'ah, Shechitah (with intent) Chutz li'Zmano or Chutz li'Mkomo, Pesulim did Kabalah and Zerikah (was done).</p></div>
<div class="indent1"><span class="nm">(b)</span><p>R. Yehudah says, if it was slaughtered at night, or the blood spilled, or the blood left the Azarah, even if they were brought up, Yered;</p></div>
<div class="indent1"><span class="nm">(c)</span><p>R. Shimon says, Lo Yered;</p></div>
<div class="indent2"><span class="nm">1.</span><p>R. Shimon says, any Pesul b'Kodesh (Rashi - it became Pasul after it was brought into the Azarah; Tosfos - after Shechitah, or perhaps after Kabalah) is accepted (Lo Yered).</p></div>
<div class="indent1"><span class="nm">(d)</span><p>The following Pesulim are not b'Kodesh;</p></div>
<div class="indent2"><span class="nm">1.</span><p>Rove'a and Nirva (an animal that had relations with a person), Muktzeh (it was designated for idolatry), Ne'evad (it was worshipped), Mechir (it was traded for a dog), Esnan (wages of a harlot), Kilayim (a crossbreed), Treifah, Yotzei Dofen (an animal born through Caesarian section), and Ba'al Mum;</p></div>
<div class="indent2"><span class="nm">2.</span><p>R. Akiva is Machshir a Ba'al Mum (Lo Yered).</p></div>
<div class="indent2"><span class="nm">3.</span><p>R. Chanina Segan ha'Kohanim says, my father would push Ba'alei Mumim off the Mizbe'ach.</p></div>
<div class="indent1"><span class="nm">(e)</span><p>Just like if Alu, Lo Yerdu, if they were taken down, Lo Ya'alu (they are not brought back up).</p></div>
<div class="indent1"><span class="nm">(f)</span><p>If any of them (this will be explained) were brought up, Yerdu.</p></div>
<div class="indent1"><span class="nm">(g)</span><p>Similarly, if an Olah was brought up alive, Yered;</p></div>
<div class="indent2"><span class="nm">1.</span><p>If it was slaughtered on the Mizbe'ach, it is flayed and dissected on the Mizbe'ach.</p></div>
<div class="indent1"><span class="nm">(h)</span><p><span class="cl">(Gemara - Beraisa - R. Yehudah):</span> "Zos Hi... <i>ha</i>'Olah" are three exclusions, to exclude a Korban slaughtered at night, or the blood spilled, or the blood left the Azarah. Even if Alu, Yerdu;</p></div>
<div class="indent1"><span class="nm">(i)</span><p>R. Shimon says, "Olah" teaches that only a Kosher Olah is offered;</p></div>
<div class="indent2"><span class="nm">1.</span><p><span class="cl">Question:</span> What is the source to include a Korban Nifsal due to the following?</p></div>
<div class="indent3"><span class="nm">i.</span><p>Shechitah at night, the blood spilled or left the Azarah, Linah, Yotzei, Tum'ah, Chutz li'Zmano, Chutz li'Mkomo, Pesulim did Kabalah and Zerikah (was done), the blood was put above (on the top half of the Mizbe'ach) instead of below or vice-versa, the blood was put on the inner Mizbe'ach instead of the outer Mizbe'ach or vice-versa, a Pesach or Chatas was slaughtered Lo Lishmah.</p></div>
<div class="indent2"><span class="nm">2.</span><p><span class="cl">Answer:</span> "Toras ha'Olah" teaches that there is one law for all Kodshim that came up, i.e. Lo Yered.</p></div>
<div class="indent2"><span class="nm">3.</span><p><span class="cl">Suggestion:</span> Perhaps we include Rove'a, Nirva, Muktzeh, Ne'evad, Mechir, Esnan, Kilayim, Treifah, and Yotzei Dofen!</p></div>
<div class="indent2"><span class="nm">4.</span><p><span class="cl">Rejection:</span> "Zos" excludes these.</p></div>
<div class="indent2"><span class="nm">5.</span><p><span class="cl">Question:</span> (The verses that include and exclude do not specify what to include or exclude.) Why do we include the former and exclude the latter, and not vice-versa?</p></div>
<div class="bbbline">84b----------------------------------------84b</p></div>
<div class="indent2"><span class="nm">6.</span><p><span class="cl">Answer:</span> We include Pesulim b'Kodesh and exclude Pesulim that are not b'Kodesh.</p></div>
<div class="indent1"><span class="nm">(j)</span><p>R. Yehudah (agrees with R. Shimon except for the three cases that R. Yehudah specified;) he learns as follows;</p></div>
<div class="indent2"><span class="nm">1.</span><p><span class="cl">(Beraisa):</span> Linah of blood is 'Kosher' (i.e. if Alah, Lo Yered), for Eimurim are Kosher after Linah;</p></div>
<div class="indent2"><span class="nm">2.</span><p>Eimurim are Kosher after Linah because meat (e.g. of a Shelamim) is permitted after Linah.</p></div>
<div class="indent2"><span class="nm">3.</span><p>Yotzei is Kosher, because this is permitted on a Bamah;</p></div>
<div class="indent2"><span class="nm">4.</span><p>Tamei is Kosher, because this is permitted for Korbanos Tzibur (if they cannot be offered b'Taharah);</p></div>
<div class="indent2"><span class="nm">5.</span><p>Chutz li'Zmano is Kosher, because Zerikah of such blood is Meratzeh (like a proper Zerikah) regarding Pigul. (Kares applies only if all the Matirim were offered without any Pesul other than Chutz li'Zmano);</p></div>
<div class="indent2"><span class="nm">6.</span><p>Chutz li'Mkomo is Kosher, because the Torah equates it to Chutz li'Zmano;</p></div>
<div class="indent2"><span class="nm">7.</span><p>If Pesulim did Kabalah and Zerikah (was done), the blood and Eimurim are Kosher. this is if the Pesulim are Kosher for Korbanos Tzibur (e.g. Teme'im).</p></div>
<div class="indent1"><span class="nm">(k)</span><p><span class="cl">Objection:</span> Can we learn something done improperly (Linah of Eimurim, or Yotzei) from something proper (Linah of meat, or Yotzei on a Bamah)?!</p></div>
<div class="indent1"><span class="nm">(l)</span><p><span class="cl">Answer:</span> Indeed, the Tana relies on "Zos Toras ha'Olah" (to include these).</p></div>
