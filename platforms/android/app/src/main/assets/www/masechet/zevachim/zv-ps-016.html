<div class="indent1"><span class="nm">(a)</span><p><span class="cl">Answer #2 (Tana d'Vei R. Yishmael):</span> We learn a Kal va'Chomer from a Ba'al Mum (blemished Kohen). A Ba'al Mum may eat Kodshei Kodoshim, but he is Mechalel Avodah. A Zar may not eat Kodshei Kodoshim, all the more so he is Mechalel Avodah!</p></div>
<div class="indent1"><span class="nm">(b)</span><p><span class="cl">Question:</span> We cannot learn from a Ba'al Mum, for this Pesul (disqualification) applies even to the Korbanos themselves!</p></div>
<div class="indent1"><span class="nm">(c)</span><p><span class="cl">Answer #1:</span> A Tamei Kohen proves that this is not the reason (Tum'ah does not apply to (living) Korbanos, yet a Tamei Kohen is Mechalel Avodah.)</p></div>
<div class="indent1"><span class="nm">(d)</span><p><span class="cl">Question:</span> We cannot learn from a Tamei, since he makes Tamei what he touches!</p></div>
<div class="indent1"><span class="nm">(e)</span><p><span class="cl">Answer:</span> A Ba'al Mum proves that this is not the reason!</p></div>
<div class="indent1"><span class="nm">(f)</span><p><span class="cl">Conclusion:</span> Each has its own stringency. The Tzad ha'Shavah of (a Ba'al Mum and Tamei) is that they are commanded not to serve, and they are Mechalel Avodah. Also a Zar is commanded not to serve, and he is Mechalel Avodah.</p></div>
<div class="indent2"><span class="nm">1.</span><p><span class="cl">Question:</span> What is the source that a Zar is commanded not to serve?</p></div>
<div class="indent3"><span class="nm">i.</span><p><span class="cl">Suggestion:</span> "...Va'Yinazru mi'Kodshei Bnei Yisrael..." (as we expounded above).</p></div>
<div class="indent3"><span class="nm">ii.</span><p><span class="cl">Rejection:</span> If (Tana d'Vei R. Yishmael holds that) the verse forbids a Zar to serve, it also teaches that he is Mechalel Avodah (it says "v'Lo Yechalelu." If so, the Kal va'Chomer is not needed)!</p></div>
<div class="indent2"><span class="nm">2.</span><p><span class="cl">Answer:</span> He learns from "v'Zar Lo Yikrav Aleichem".</p></div>
<div class="indent1"><span class="nm">(g)</span><p><span class="cl">Question:</span> We cannot learn from a Ba'al Mum and a Tamei. Both of those are forbidden to serve on a Bamah (even when Bamos are permitted), but a Zar is not!</p></div>
<div class="indent1"><span class="nm">(h)</span><p><span class="cl">Answer #2 (to Question (b)):</span> We do not use a Tamei to answer the question from Ba'al Mum, rather, an Onen.</p></div>
<div class="indent1"><span class="nm">(i)</span><p><span class="cl">Question:</span> We cannot learn from an Onen. He is forbidden to eat Ma'aser (but a Zar is permitted)!</p></div>
<div class="indent1"><span class="nm">(j)</span><p><span class="cl">Answer:</span> A Ba'al Mum may eat Ma'aser. We learn from the Tzad ha'Shavah of a Ba'al Mum and Onen. They are commanded not to serve, and they are Mechalel Avodah. The same applies to a Zar.</p></div>
<div class="indent1"><span class="nm">(k)</span><p><span class="cl">Question:</span> Still, we cannot learn from these, for they may not serve on a Bamah!</p></div>
<div class="indent2"><span class="nm">1.</span><p><span class="cl">Question (Rav Sama brei d'Rava):</span> What is the source that an Onen may not serve on a Bamah? Perhaps he is permitted!</p></div>
<div class="indent1"><span class="nm">(l)</span><p><span class="cl">Answer #3 (to Question 3:d, 15b - Rav Mesharshiya):</span> We learn that a Zar is Mechalel Avodah from a Kal va'Chomer from someone sitting:</p></div>
<div class="indent2"><span class="nm">1.</span><p>Someone sitting may eat Kodshei Kodoshim, but he is Mechalel Avodah. A Zar may not eat Kodshei Kodoshim, all the more so he is Mechalel Avodah!</p></div>
<div class="indent1"><span class="nm">(m)</span><p><span class="cl">Question:</span> We cannot learn from someone sitting. He cannot testify!</p></div>
<div class="indent1"><span class="nm">(n)</span><p><span class="cl">Answer:</span> We learn the Kal va'Chomer from a sitting Chacham. (He may testify.)</p></div>
<div class="indent1"><span class="nm">(o)</span><p><span class="cl">Question:</span> We can still challenge this. Sitting is a Pesul regarding testimony (even if it does not apply to a Chacham)!</p></div>
<div class="indent1"><span class="nm">(p)</span><p><span class="cl">Answer #1:</span> Rav Mesharshiya does not consider that to be a challenge.</p></div>
<div class="indent1"><span class="nm">(q)</span><p><span class="cl">Answer #2:</span> It is a challenge. He learns from a Tzad ha'Shavah of a sitting Chacham and a Ba'al Mum, Tamei or Onen.</p></div>
<div class="indent1"><span class="nm">(r)</span><p><span class="cl">Question:</span> We must say that one may serve on a Bamah while sitting. (If not, we cannot learn from the Tzad ha'Shavah, since all the sources in the Tzad ha'Shavah may not serve on a Bamah.) What is the source of this?</p></div>
<div class="indent1"><span class="nm">(s)</span><p><span class="cl">Answer:</span> "La'amod Lifnei Hash-m Leshareso" - only in front of Hash-m (in the Mikdash) one must stand. One may serve on a Bamah while sitting.</p></div>

<div class="indent2"><span class="nm">1.</span><p><span class="cl">Inference:</span> If a regular Kohen did Avodah when he was an Onen, he is Mechalel Avodah.</p></div>
<div class="indent1"><span class="nm">(d)</span><p><span class="cl">Answer #2 (R. Elazar):</span> (Moshe asked Aharon why the Chatas of Rosh Chodesh was burned. He answered "Hen ha'Yom Hikrivu (did they offer it?!" Nadav and Avihu had died that day, so Aharon and his sons were Onenim. Had his sons (regular Kohanim) offered it, this would have disqualified it.)</p></div>
<div class="indent2"><span class="nm">1.</span><p>R. Elazar did not learn from "u'Min ha'Mikdash Lo Yetzei..." for it does not say that a regular Kohen who is an Onen is Mechalel Avodah (and he does not make the above inference);</p></div>
<div class="indent2"><span class="nm">2.</span><p>The first opinion did not learn from "Hen ha'Yom Hikrivu..." because he holds that the Chatas was burned because it became Tamei. ("Hen ha'Yom" explains why it was not eaten earlier, because no Onen may eat Kodshim. It does not allude to Avodah of Onenim).</p></div>
<div class="indent1"><span class="nm">(e)</span><p><span class="cl">Answer #3 (Tana d'Vei R. Yishmael):</span> We learn from a Kal va'Chomer from a Ba'al Mum:</p></div>

<div class="indent1"><span class="nm">(f)</span><p><span class="cl">Question:</span> We cannot learn from a Ba'al Mum, for this Pesul applies even to the Korbanos themselves!</p></div>
<div class="indent1"><span class="nm">(g)</span><p><span class="cl">Answer:</span> A Zar proves that this is not the reason. (Zarus does not apply to Korbanos, yet a Zar is Mechalel Avodah.)</p></div>

<div class="indent1"><span class="nm">(j)</span><p>We learn from the Tzad ha'Shavah. They are commanded not to serve, and they are Mechalel Avodah. Al/so an Onen is commanded not to serve, and he is Mechalel Avodah!</p></div>

<div class="indent2"><span class="nm">2.</span><p><span class="cl">Answer:</span> He learns from "Hen ha'Yom Hikrivu" (but he does not learn from this that an Onen is Mechalel Avodah as R. Elazar did. If we had no other source that an Onen is Mechalel Avodah, we could explain that before Aharon said this verse, he had told Moshe that the Chatas was burned due to Aninus. Moshe thought he meant that Aharon' sons mistakenly offered it (and also mistakeny thought that this disqualified it). Aharon then said this verse to explain that he himself (the Kohen Gadol, who may serve in Aninus) offered it). It was burned because no Kohen could eat it. (The Tana holds that Aninus lasts until morning, and then one may not eat the Chatas.)</p></div>
<div class="indent1"><span class="nm">(k)</span><p><span class="cl">Question:</span> We cannot learn from a Ba'al Mum and a Zar, for they may never serve (whereas an Onen Kohen Gadol is permitted)!</p></div>

<div class="indent2"><span class="nm">1.</span><p>Someone sitting may eat Kodshim, but he is Mechalel Avodah. An Onen may not eat Kodshim, all the more so he is Mechalel Avodah!</p></div>
