<div class="subject"><span class="nm">1)</span><p>WHEN PRIVATE BAMOS ARE ALLOWED</p></div>
<div class="indent1"><span class="nm">(a)</span><p><span class="cl">(Gemara - R. Yitzchak):</span> I heard that we may offer Korbanos in Beis Chonyo (a place of Avodah in Mitzrayim) nowadays.</p></div>
<div class="indent2"><span class="nm">1.</span><p>He holds that Beis Chonyo is not a house of idolatry. He also holds that the initial Kedushah of Yerushalayim was not permanent, so Bamos are permitted after the Churban.</p></div>
<div class="indent2"><span class="nm">2.</span><p>He learns from "You have not yet come to the Menuchah (rest) and to the Nachalah (inheritance)". Menuchah and Nachalah refer to Shilo and Yerushalayim, respectively.</p></div>
<div class="indent2"><span class="nm">3.</span><p>This equates Shilo and Yerushalayim. Just like Bamos were permitted after Shilo, they were permitted after Yerushalayim.</p></div>
<div class="indent1"><span class="nm">(b)</span><p><span class="cl">Rabanan:</span> Did you say that?</p></div>
<div class="indent1"><span class="nm">(c)</span><p><span class="cl">R. Yitzchak:</span> No.</p></div>
<div class="indent1"><span class="nm">(d)</span><p><span class="cl">(Rava):</span> I swear that he did say it, and I learned it from him! He retracted because of Rav Mari's question.</p></div>
<div class="indent1"><span class="nm">(e)</span><p><span class="cl">Question #1 (Rav Mari - Mishnah):</span> Bamos were permitted after Shilo, but not after Yerushalayim.</p></div>
<div class="indent1"><span class="nm">(f)</span><p><span class="cl">Question #2 (Mishnah):</span> Once the Mikdash was built in Yerushalayim, Bamos were prohibited and were never permitted again. This was the "Nachalah".</p></div>
<div class="indent1"><span class="nm">(g)</span><p><span class="cl">Answer #1 (to both questions):</span> Tana'im argue about whether or not Kedushas Yerushalayim still applies.</p></div>
<div class="indent2"><span class="nm">1.</span><p><span class="cl">(Mishnah - R. Eliezer):</span> I heard that when they were building the Mikdash, they made curtains for (the areas that will be enclosed by) the Heichal and the Azarah.</p></div>
<div class="indent3"><span class="nm">i.</span><p>The Heichal walls were built outside its curtains; the Azarah walls were built inside its curtains.</p></div>
<div class="indent2"><span class="nm">2.</span><p><span class="cl">R. Yehoshua:</span> I heard that we may offer Korbanos even without a Temple, and eat Kodshei Kodoshim even without curtains, and eat Kodshim Kalim and Maaser Sheni, even though there is no wall (around Yerushalayim), because Kedushas Yerushalayim was permanent.</p></div>
<div class="indent3"><span class="nm">i.</span><p><span class="cl">Inference:</span> R. Eliezer holds that (curtains were needed because) the Kedushah ceased!</p></div>
<div class="indent1"><span class="nm">(h)</span><p><span class="cl">Objection (Ravina):</span> Perhaps both hold that the Kedushah was permanent. Each Tana said what he heard.</p></div>
<div class="indent2"><span class="nm">1.</span><p><span class="cl">Question:</span> If so, how does R. Eliezer explain why there were curtains?</p></div>
<div class="indent2"><span class="nm">2.</span><p><span class="cl">Answer:</span> They were merely for Tzni'us (places of Kedushah should not be so exposed).</p></div>
<div class="indent1"><span class="nm">(i)</span><p><span class="cl">Answer #2:</span> The following Tana'im argue about whether or not the Kedushah ended. (A Mishnah (Erchin 32a) lists walled cities - old Ketzarah of Tzipori... )</p></div>
<div class="indent2"><span class="nm">1.</span><p><span class="cl">(Beraisa - R. Yishmael b'Rebbi Yosi):</span> Chachamim listed cities that the returning exiles (from Bavel) were Mekadesh;</p></div>
<div class="indent2"><span class="nm">2.</span><p>The first Kedushah ceased when the Kedushah of Eretz Yisrael ceased (after the first Churban).</p></div>
<div class="indent2"><span class="nm">3.</span><p>This shows that R. Yishmael b'Rebbi Yosi holds that the first Kedushah ceased.</p></div>
<div class="indent1"><span class="nm">(j)</span><p><span class="cl">Contradiction (Beraisa - R. Yishmael b'Rebbi Yosi):</span> The cities listed are not the only walled cities. Moshe conquered "Shishim Ir... Mamleches Og... Betzuros Chomah!" The Mishnah lists only the cities that the returning exiles found and were Mekadesh.</p></div>
<div class="bbbline">10b----------------------------------------10b</p></div>
<div class="indent2"><span class="nm">1.</span><p><span class="cl">Interjection:</span> The Seifa (of this Beraisa, brought below) says that they did not need to be Mekadesh them!</p></div>
<div class="indent2"><span class="nm">2.</span><p><span class="cl">Correction:</span> Rather, we list cities known to have had a wall;</p></div>
<div class="indent3"><span class="nm">i.</span><p>If there is a tradition about another city that it had a wall when Yehoshua entered Eretz Yisrael, the Mitzvos of walled cities (one who sells a house has a year to redeem it, a Metzora cannot stay there) also applies to it, because the first Kedushah was permanent.</p></div>
<div class="indent2"><span class="nm">3.</span><p>This contradicts what R. Yishmael b'Rebbi Yosi said in the above Beraisa!</p></div>
<div class="indent1"><span class="nm">(k)</span><p><span class="cl">Answer #1:</span> Tana'im argue about his opinion.</p></div>
<div class="indent1"><span class="nm">(l)</span><p><span class="cl">Answer #2:</span> The Tana of the Tosefta is really R. <i>Eliezer</i> bar Yosi:</p></div>
<div class="indent2"><span class="nm">1.</span><p><span class="cl">(Beraisa - R. Eliezer bar Yosi):</span> "Asher Lo Chomah" - ("Lo" is written with an Aleph, to include) even if it does not have a wall now, if it once had one!</p></div>
<div class="subject"><span class="nm">2)</span><p>VA'YEHI CONNOTES PAIN</p></div>
<div class="indent1"><span class="nm">(a)</span><p><span class="cl">(R. Levi):</span> We have a tradition from Anshei Keneses ha'Gedolah that 'va'Yehi' (and it was) always denotes pain"</p></div>
<div class="indent2"><span class="nm">1.</span><p>"Va'Yehi bi'Ymei Achashverosh" there was Haman.</p></div>
<div class="indent2"><span class="nm">2.</span><p>"Va'Yehi bi'Ymei Shefot ha'Shoftim" there was a famine.</p></div>

<div class="indent2"><span class="nm">8.</span><p>"Va'Yehi Ish me'Ramasayim" - Chanah was barren.</p></div>
<div class="indent2"><span class="nm">9.</span><p>"Va'Yehi when Shmuel grew old" - "His sons did not go in his ways."</p></div>
<div class="indent2"><span class="nm">10.</span><p>"Va'Yehi David was succeeding in all his ways and Hash-m was with him" - "Sha'ul put his eye on David".</p></div>

<div class="indent1"><span class="nm">(b)</span><p><span class="cl">Question:</span> It says, "Va'Yehi on the eighth day (of Chanukas ha'Mishkan)"!</p></div>
<div class="indent2"><span class="nm">1.</span><p><span class="cl">(Beraisa):</span> That day there was a Simchah in front of Hash-m like the day Heaven and earth were created.</p></div>
<div class="indent2"><span class="nm">2.</span><p>In both places it says "va'Yehi."</p></div>
<div class="indent1"><span class="nm">(c)</span><p><span class="cl">Answer:</span> Nadav and Avihu died.</p></div>
<div class="indent1"><span class="nm">(d)</span><p><span class="cl">Question:</span> "Va'Yehi in the 480th year (the Beis ha'Mikdash was completed)"!</p></div>

<div class="indent1"><span class="nm">(h)</span><p><span class="cl">Answer (Rav Ashi):</span> "Va'Yehi" is sometimes good, and sometimes painful. "Va'Yehi bi'Ymei is always pain. In five places it says "Va'Yehi bi'Ymei":</p></div>

<div class="subject"><span class="nm">3)</span><p>TRADITIONS OF R. LEVI</p></div>
<div class="indent1"><span class="nm">(a)</span><p><span class="cl">(R. Levi):</span> We have a tradition that Amotz and Amatzyah are brothers.</p></div>
<div class="indent1"><span class="nm">(b)</span><p><span class="cl">Question:</span> What do we learn from this?</p></div>
<div class="indent1"><span class="nm">(c)</span><p><span class="cl">Answer:</span> This teaches like Rav Shmuel bar Nachmani, that a Kalah who is modest in her father-in-law's house merits that kings and Nevi'im will descend from her;</p></div>
<div class="indent2"><span class="nm">1.</span><p>We learn from Tamar - "Yehudah saw her and thought that she was a harlot because she covered her face".</p></div>
<div class="indent2"><span class="nm">2.</span><p><span class="cl">Question:</span> Normally a harlot does not cover her face!</p></div>
<div class="indent2"><span class="nm">3.</span><p><span class="cl">Answer:</span> Rather, because she <i>had</i> covered her face in his house he didn't recognize her now, and she merited that kings and Nevi'im would descend from her.</p></div>
<div class="indent2"><span class="nm">4.</span><p>Kings descended from her, i.e. (all kings of Beis) David;</p></div>
<div class="indent2"><span class="nm">5.</span><p>Nevi'im descended from her, like R. Levi taught, that Amotz was the brother of Amatzyah (a king of Beis David), and it says "Chazon Yeshayahu ben Amotz". (Since Yeshayahu's lineage is traced to his father, this shows that also his father was a Navi - Megilah 15a.)</p></div>
<div class="indent1"><span class="nm">(d)</span><p><span class="cl">R. Levi:</span> We have a tradition that the Aron did not take up any space!</p></div>
<div class="indent1"><span class="nm">(e)</span><p><span class="cl">(Support - Beraisa):</span> There were 10 Amos from Moshe's Aron (until the wall) in each direction;</p></div>
<div class="indent2"><span class="nm">1.</span><p>It says "V'Lifnei ha'Devir Esrim Amah." (Turei Even deletes the verse of the Cheruvim from the text, for it has no relevance to what we are proving.)</p></div>
<div class="indent2"><span class="nm">2.</span><p>There was no space for the Aron! This shows that it stood miraculously.</p></div>
<div class="subject"><span class="nm">4)</span><p>PRELUDES TO MEGILAS ESTHER</p></div>
<div class="indent1"><span class="nm">(a)</span><p>When R. Yonason would expound the Megilah, he would begin "And I will rise upon them ... and I will cut off from Bavel Shem v'Sheir v'Nin v'Neched";</p></div>
<div class="indent2"><span class="nm">1.</span><p>"Shem" is the writing, "Sheir" is the language, "Nin" is the kingship, and "Neched" (grandchild) is Vashti.</p></div>
<div class="indent1"><span class="nm">(b)</span><p>Shmuel bar Nachmani would begin to expound with "In place of ha'Na'atzutz will rise b'Rosh; in place of Sarpad will rise Hadas";</p></div>
<div class="indent2"><span class="nm">1.</span><p>'Na'atzutz' is Haman ha'Rasha, who made himself an idol;</p></div>
<div class="indent3"><span class="nm">i.</span><p>Idolatry is called Na'atzutz - "In all the Na'atzutzim and in all the barren trees."</p></div>
<div class="indent2"><span class="nm">2.</span><p>'Rosh' is Mordechai, who is called the first of the spices (used for Shemen ha'Mishchah) - "Kach Lecha Besamim Rosh Mar Deror... ";</p></div>
<div class="indent3"><span class="nm">i.</span><p>The Targum of "Mar Deror" is Mari Dachi.</p></div>
<div class="indent2"><span class="nm">3.</span><p>"SaRPaD" is Vashti ha'Resha'ah, the granddaughter of Nevuchadnetzar ha'Rasha, who burned ReFiDas Beis Hash-m (the Beis ha'Mikdash) - "Refidaso Zahav".</p></div>
<div class="indent2"><span class="nm">4.</span><p>"Hadas" is Esther, who is called Hadasah - "And he raised Hadasah."</p></div>
<div class="indent1"><span class="nm">(c)</span><p>"V'Hayah la'Shem l'Shem" - this is Keri'as ha'Megilah (Maharsha - Hash-m's name is not in the Megilah, but it is mentioned when we bless on reading the Megilah);</p></div>
<div class="indent2"><span class="nm">1.</span><p>"For an eternal sign that will not be cut off" - these are the days of Purim.</p></div>
<div class="indent1"><span class="nm">(d)</span><p>R. Yehoshua ben Levi would begin to expound with "And it will be, like Hash-m rejoiced over you to do good to you, so He will rejoice over you to do evil to you."</p></div>
<div class="indent1"><span class="nm">(e)</span><p><span class="cl">Question:</span> Hash-m does not rejoice at the downfall of the wicked!</p></div>
<div class="indent2"><span class="nm">1.</span><p><span class="cl">(R. Yochanan):</span> "(Yehoshafat appointed singers, and) when they went out to war they would say 'Hodu la'Shem Ki l'Olam Chasdo'". 'Ki Tov' is omitted, because Hash-m does not rejoice at the downfall of the wicked.</p></div>
<div class="indent2"><span class="nm">2.</span><p><span class="cl">(R. Yochanan) Question:</span> What does it mean "V'Lo Karav Zeh El Zeh Kol ha'Laylah"?</p></div>
<div class="indent2"><span class="nm">3.</span><p><span class="cl">Answer:</span> The angels wanted to sing (this is like "V'Kara Zeh El Zeh"), but Hash-m said to them 'the works of My hands are drowning in the sea, and you sing?!'</p></div>
<div class="indent1"><span class="nm">(f)</span><p><span class="cl">Answer (R. Elazar):</span> Hash-m does not rejoice, but He makes others rejoice (to punish the wicked).</p></div>
<div class="indent2"><span class="nm">1.</span><p><span class="cl">Support:</span> (Regarding punishing) it says "Yasis" (He will make rejoice), not 'Yasos' (He will rejoice).</p></div>
<div class="indent1"><span class="nm">(g)</span><p>R. Aba bar Kahana would begin with "L'Adam she'Tov Lefanav Nosan Chachmah v'Da'as v'Simchah" - this is Mordechai ha'Tzadik;</p></div>
<div class="indent2"><span class="nm">1.</span><p>"To the sinner He gave the desire to gather and store" - this is Haman.</p></div>
<div class="indent2"><span class="nm">2.</span><p>"To give (the stored wealth) to whom is good in front of Hash-m" - this is Mordechai and Esther, "And Esther put Mordechai over the house of Haman."</p></div>
<div class="indent1"><span class="nm">(h)</span><p>Raba bar Ufron would begin with "And I put My throne in Ilam, and I destroyed from there a king and nobles" - "king" refers to Vashti, and "nobles" refers to Haman and his 10 sons.</p></div>
