<p class="dedicationbox">BAVA BASRA 162 - A week of learning has been dedicated towards meriting a Refu'ah Sheleimah for Eliezer Lipa ben Yetta, by Mr. and Mrs. Kornfeld of Yerushalayim. </p>

<p class="bas subject"><span class="nm">1)</span>THE LAST LINE OF A DOCUMENT (cont.)</p>
<p class="bas indent1"><span class="nm">(a)</span><span class="cl">Question (Rav Nachman):</span> Why don't we learn from the last line of a document?</p>
<p class="bas indent1"><span class="nm">(b)</span><span class="cl">Answer (Rav Amram - Beraisa #1):</span> If the witnesses left two blank lines between the text and their signatures, it is invalid; if they left one blank line, it is valid.</p>
<p class="bas indent2"><span class="nm">1.</span><span class="cl">Question:</span> When they left two blank lines, it is invalid. Presumably, we are concerned lest the bearer add clauses to his benefit;</p>
<p class="bas indent3"><span class="nm">i.</span>The same concern applies when one blank line was left!</p>
<p class="bas indent2"><span class="nm">2.</span><span class="cl">Answer:</span> We must say that we do not learn from the last line.</p>

<p class="bas subject"><span class="nm">2)</span>BLANK LINES AFTER THE TEXT</p>
<p class="bas indent1"><span class="nm">(a)</span><span class="cl">Question:</span> If one and a half blank lines were left after the text, what is the law?</p>
<p class="bas indent1"><span class="nm">(b)</span><span class="cl">Answer #1 (Beraisa #1):</span> If they left two blank lines, it is invalid.</p>
<p class="bas indent2"><span class="nm">1.</span><span class="cl">Inference:</span> If they left one and a half blank lines, it is valid!</p>
<p class="bas indent1"><span class="nm">(c)</span><span class="cl">Objection:</span> The Seifa teaches that if they left one blank line, it is valid. This implies that if they left one and a half blank lines, it is invalid!</p>
<p class="bas indent1"><span class="nm">(d)</span><span class="cl">Conclusion:</span> The inferences contradict one another. We cannot determine which is correct (to answer the question from the Beraisa).</p>
<p class="bas indent1"><span class="nm">(e)</span><span class="cl">Answer #2 (Beraisa #2):</span> If they left two blank lines, it is invalid. If they left less than this, it is valid. (This answers our question. The Gemara brings the entire Beraisa.)</p>
<p class="bas indent1"><span class="nm">(f)</span>If four or five witnesses signed on a document, and one (our text, Rambam; Rashbam's text - the first two) of them were found to be relatives or invalid witnesses, the document is valid due to the Kosher witnesses.</p>
<p class="bas indent1"><span class="nm">(g)</span>This supports Chizkiyah.</p>
<p class="bas indent2"><span class="nm">1.</span><span class="cl">(Chizkiyah):</span> If blank lines between the text and the signatures were filled with signatures of relatives, it is valid;</p>
<p class="bas indent2"><span class="nm">2.</span>We likewise find in the laws of Sechach (that a gap is worse than something invalid). Three Tefachim (width) of air (from one end of the Sukah to the other) disqualify a Sukah, but invalid Sechach disqualifies a Sukah only if it is four Tefachim.</p>
