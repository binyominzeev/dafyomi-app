<p class="bas subject"><span class="nm">1)</span>ARE WE CONCERNED FOR THE STRENGTH OF <i>BEIS</i> <i>DIN</i>?</p>
<p class="bas indent1"><span class="nm">(a)</span><span class="cl">Question:</span> Rav Nachman is concerned for the strength of Beis Din!</p>
<p class="bas indent2"><span class="nm">1.</span><span class="cl">(Rav Nachman citing Shmuel):</span> If orphans come to divide their father's property, Beis Din appoints a guardian for them and they select a nice portion for them. When the orphans grow up, they can demand a new division;</p>
<p class="bas indent2"><span class="nm">2.</span><span class="cl">(Rav Nachman himself):</span> They cannot demand a new division. If they could, Beis Din would be weak!</p>
<p class="bas indent1"><span class="nm">(b)</span><span class="cl">Answer:</span> Regarding money, Rav Nachman says that Beis Din gave strength to their enactments, but not regarding Isurim.</p>
<p class="bas subject"><span class="nm">2)</span>GILUY DA'AS TO CANCEL A <i>GET</i></p>
<p class="bas indent1"><span class="nm">(a)</span>Gidal bar Re'ilai sent a Get to his wife. She was weaving when the Shali'ach came. She told him to return the next day.</p>
<p class="bas indent2"><span class="nm">1.</span>When Gidal heard about this, he said 'blessed is Hash-m, Who is good and does good'!</p>
<p class="bas indent2"><span class="nm">2.</span><span class="cl">Abaye:</span> He blessed Hash-m, but he did not cancel the Get.</p>
<p class="bas indent2"><span class="nm">3.</span><span class="cl">Rava:</span> The Berachah shows that he wanted to cancel the Get, and it is cancelled!</p>
<p class="bas indent2"><span class="nm">4.</span>They argue about whether or not Giluy Da'as (showing desire to cancel a Get) cancels the Get.</p>
<p class="bas indent3"><span class="nm">i.</span>Rava says that it does; Abaye says it does not.</p>
<p class="bas indent1"><span class="nm">(b)</span><span class="cl">(Rava):</span> We can infer that Rav Sheshes holds that Giluy Da'as cancels a Get;</p>
<p class="bas indent2"><span class="nm">1.</span>Rav Sheshes forced a man to (make Sheluchim to) divorce his wife. The man (lied and) told the Sheluchim that Rav Sheshes told them to cancel the Get. Rav Sheshes required them to write another Get. (There was a Giluy Da'as, so the first Get was cancelled.)</p>
<p class="bas indent1"><span class="nm">(c)</span><span class="cl">Rejection (Abaye):</span> Rav Sheshes cannot cancel another man's Get!</p>
<p class="bas indent2"><span class="nm">1.</span>Rather, the man cancelled his own Get. He said this in Rav Sheshes' name, so they would not whip him.</p>
<p class="bas indent1"><span class="nm">(d)</span><span class="cl">(Abaye):</span> We can infer that Rav Yehudah holds that Giluy Da'as does not cancel a Get.</p>
<p class="bas indent2"><span class="nm">1.</span>Rav Yehudah forced the son-in-law of R. Yirmeyah Bira'ah to divorce his wife. The man cancelled the Get. He forced him again and again, and he cancelled it each time.</p>
<p class="bas indent2"><span class="nm">2.</span>The last time, he told the Sheluchim to stuff gourds in their ears (so they will not hear him cancel it).</p>
<p class="bas indent3"><span class="nm">i.</span>Even though they see him pursuing them to cancel it, the Get is valid!</p>
<p class="bas indent1"><span class="nm">(e)</span><span class="cl">Rejection (Rava):</span> (This is not a Giluy Da'as.) It is not clear why he runs. Perhaps he wants them to give it quickly!</p>
<p class="bas indent1"><span class="nm">(f)</span><span class="cl">(Abaye):</span> We can infer that Shmuel holds that Giluy Da'as does not cancel a Get.</p>
<p class="bas indent2"><span class="nm">1.</span>A man told his wife 'this Get should take effect if I do not return in 30 days.'</p>
<p class="bas indent2"><span class="nm">2.</span>The man was returning; the ferry to cross the river was not available. He shouted 'see, I am returning!'</p>
<p class="bas indent2"><span class="nm">3.</span><span class="cl">Shmuel:</span> This is not called returning. The Get takes effect.</p>
<p class="bas indent1"><span class="nm">(g)</span><span class="cl">Rejection (Rava):</span> The man did not intend to cancel the Get. He intended to fulfill his Tanai (stipulation, which would prevent the Get from taking effect), but he failed.</p>
<p class="bas indent1"><span class="nm">(h)</span>A man told his Arusah 'this Get should take effect if I do not make Nisu'in within 30 days.'</p>
<p class="bas indent2"><span class="nm">1.</span>On day 30, the man exclaimed 'I exerted to make the Nisu'in (but I was unable)!'</p>
<p class="bas indent1"><span class="nm">(i)</span><span class="cl">Question:</span> Is there any reason to say that she is not divorced?</p>
<p class="bas indent2"><span class="nm">1.</span><span class="cl">Suggestion:</span> He was Anus (factors beyond his control prevented him from fulfilling his Tanai).</p>
<p class="bas indent2"><span class="nm">2.</span><span class="cl">Rejection:</span> Ones does not invalidate a Get!</p>
<p class="bas indent2"><span class="nm">3.</span><span class="cl">Suggestion:</span> There was a Giluy Da'as.</p>
<p class="bas indent2"><span class="nm">4.</span><span class="cl">Rejection:</span> Abaye and Rava argue about this. (Abaye holds that it does not cancel the Get. And Rava, who says that it does, holds that desire to fulfill the condition does not help.)</p>
<p class="bas indent1"><span class="nm">(j)</span>A man told his Arusah 'this Get should take effect if I do not make Nisu'in by Rosh Chodesh Adar.'</p>
<p class="bas indent2"><span class="nm">1.</span>When Rosh Chodesh Adar came, he said 'I meant Rosh Chodesh Nisan!'</p>
<p class="bas indent1"><span class="nm">(k)</span><span class="cl">Question:</span> Is there any reason to say that she is not divorced?</p>
<p class="bas indent2"><span class="nm">1.</span><span class="cl">Suggestion:</span> He was Anus (he erred).</p>
<p class="bas indent2"><span class="nm">2.</span><span class="cl">Rejection:</span> Ones does not invalidate a Get!</p>
<p class="bas indent2"><span class="nm">3.</span><span class="cl">Suggestion:</span> There was a Giluy Da'as.</p>
<p class="bas indent2"><span class="nm">4.</span><span class="cl">Rejection:</span> Abaye and Rava argue about this. (Both agree that such a Giluy Da'as does not help.)</p>
<p class="bas indent1"><span class="nm">(l)</span>The Halachah follows Rav Nachman, who permits canceling a Get in front of two people;</p>
<p class="bas indent1"><span class="nm">(m)</span>The Halachah follows Rav Nachman, who says that the Halachah follows Rebbi in both cases;</p>
<p class="bas bbbline">34b----------------------------------------34b</p>
<p class="bas indent1"><span class="nm">(n)</span>The Halachah follows Nachmani (Abaye, regarding Giluy Da'as about a Get).</p>
<p class="bas subject"><span class="nm">3)</span>THE ENACTMENT OF NAMES ON THE <i>GET</i></p>
<p class="bas indent1"><span class="nm">(a)</span><span class="cl">(Mishnah):</span> At first, one would write on a Get the name he was called in the place the Get was written, even if this was different from his name elsewhere.</p>
<p class="bas indent1"><span class="nm">(b)</span>For Tikun ha'Olam, R. Gamliel the elder enacted that they should write 'Ploni and every name that he has; Plonis and every name that she has.' (Tosfos - they write all their names in the Get.)</p>
<p class="bas indent1"><span class="nm">(c)</span><span class="cl">(Gemara - Rav Yehudah):</span> Chachamim of Chutz La'aretz asked Chachamim of Eretz Yisrael 'if a man came here from Eretz Yisrael, and in one place he is called Yochanan, and in the other, Yosef, which name should be written on the Get?'</p>
<p class="bas indent1"><span class="nm">(d)</span>This prompted R. Gamliel to enact writing 'Ploni and every name that he has; Plonis and every name that she has', for Tikun ha'Olam.</p>
<p class="bas indent1"><span class="nm">(e)</span><span class="cl">(Rav Ashi):</span> This applies only when he is known by both names.</p>
<p class="bas indent1"><span class="nm">(f)</span><span class="cl">Support #1 (R. Aba):</span> R. Mari and R. Elazar hold like you.</p>
<p class="bas indent1"><span class="nm">(g)</span><span class="cl">Support #2 (Beraisa):</span> If a man had two wives, one in Yehudah, one in Galil, and he is called different names in Yehudah and Galil:</p>
<p class="bas indent2"><span class="nm">1.</span>If he divorces the wife in Yehudah with the name he uses in Yehudah, and the wife in Galil with his Galil name, they are not divorced;</p>
<p class="bas indent3"><span class="nm">i.</span>He must divorce the Yehudah wife with his Yehudah name and his Galil name; he must divorce the Galil wife with his Galil name and his Yehudah name.</p>
<p class="bas indent2"><span class="nm">2.</span>If he went to a different place and divorced with either name, she is divorced.</p>
<p class="bas indent2"><span class="nm">3.</span><span class="cl">Question:</span> We said that he must also write his other name!</p>
<p class="bas indent2"><span class="nm">4.</span><span class="cl">Answer:</span> That is only in a place where he is known to have both names.</p>
<p class="bas indent1"><span class="nm">(h)</span>There was a woman who was called Miryam. A minority of people called her Sarah.</p>
<p class="bas indent1"><span class="nm">(i)</span><span class="cl">Chachamim of Neharde'a:</span> Her Get must say 'Miryam and every name that she has', not 'Sarah and every name that she has,'</p>
<p class="bas subject"><span class="nm">4)</span>WE DO NOT LET WIDOWS SWEAR</p>
<p class="bas indent1"><span class="nm">(a)</span><span class="cl">(Mishnah):</span> A widow collects her Kesuvah from orphans' property only by swearing (that she did not already receive her Kesuvah).</p>
<p class="bas indent1"><span class="nm">(b)</span>Judges refrained from administering the oath. R. Gamliel enacted that she should vow like the orphans desire (something very hard to fulfill, e.g. to forbid to herself all solid food if she already received her Kesuvah) and then collect.</p>
<p class="bas indent1"><span class="nm">(c)</span>Witnesses sign a Get. This is an enactment for Tikun ha'Olam.</p>
<p class="bas indent1"><span class="nm">(d)</span>Pruzbul is an enactment for Tikun ha'Olam.</p>
<p class="bas indent1"><span class="nm">(e)</span><span class="cl">(Gemara) Question:</span> Anyone must swear before collecting from the property of orphans! Why does the Mishnah specify a widow?</p>
<p class="bas indent1"><span class="nm">(f)</span><span class="cl">Answer:</span> It needs to teach about a widow;</p>
<p class="bas indent2"><span class="nm">1.</span>One might have thought that Chachamim would allow a widow to collect without swearing, to encourage marriage. The Mishnah teaches that this is not so.</p>
