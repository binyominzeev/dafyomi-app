<div class="subject"><span class="nm">1)</span><p>REDEMPTION OF A BA'AL MUM</p></div>
<div class="indent1"><span class="nm">(a)</span><p><span class="cl">(Mishnah):</span> If one was Makdish an animal with a permanent (Kavu'a) Mum for any Korban, and it was redeemed, the following laws apply to the animal:</p></div>
<div class="indent2"><span class="nm">1.</span><p>(If it will bear a firstborn male,) Kedushas Bechor applies to it. Matanos must be given (when it is slaughtered). It becomes Chulin (permitted) with respect to shearing it and working with it. Its offspring and milk (after redemption) are permitted. One who slaughters it outside (the Mikdash) is exempt. It cannot make (another animal Kodesh through) Temurah;</p></div>
<div class="indent2"><span class="nm">2.</span><p>If it died, it is redeemed, except for Bechor or Ma'aser.</p></div>
<div class="indent1"><span class="nm">(b)</span><p>If one was Makdish an animal with no Mum or a temporary (Over) Mum, and it became a Ba'al Mum Kavu'a, and it was redeemed, the following laws apply:</p></div>
<div class="indent2"><span class="nm">1.</span><p>It is exempt from Bechorah and from Matanos, it does not become Chulin regarding shearing it or working with it, its offspring and milk are forbidden, one who slaughters it outside is liable, it can make Temurah;</p></div>
<div class="indent2"><span class="nm">2.</span><p>If it died (without Shechitah), it is buried.</p></div>
<div class="indent1"><span class="nm">(c)</span><p><span class="cl">(Gemara) Inference:</span> (In the Reisha) Kedushas Bechor and Matanos apply because it was redeemed. If not, it would be exempt;</p></div>
<div class="indent2"><span class="nm">1.</span><p>The Tana holds that Kedushas Damim exempts from Bechorah and Matanos.</p></div>
<div class="indent1"><span class="nm">(d)</span><p><span class="cl">(Mishnah):</span> It becomes Chulin (regarding shearing it or working with it).</p></div>
<div class="indent1"><span class="nm">(e)</span><p><span class="cl">Inference:</span> These are permitted because it was redeemed. If not, they would be forbidden.</p></div>
<div class="indent1"><span class="nm">(f)</span><p><span class="cl">Suggestion:</span> This supports R. Elazar, who forbids shearing or working with Kodshei Bedek ha'Bayis (which is also Kedushas Damim)!</p></div>
<div class="indent1"><span class="nm">(g)</span><p><span class="cl">Rejection:</span> No. This animal has Kedushas Damim for the sake of (buying) Kodshei Mizbe'ach. This can be confused with Kedushas ha'Guf for the Mizbe'ach. Chachamim decreed to forbid shearing it or working with it before redemption;</p></div>
<div class="indent2"><span class="nm">1.</span><p>(Perhaps) there is no decree concerning Bedek ha'Bayis. (Shitah Mekubetzes - normally, one may not work with Bedek ha'Bayis. The case is, one paid Hekdesh for its labor, or we discuss less than the value of a Perutah, which does not become Hekdesh.)</p></div>
<div class="indent1"><span class="nm">(h)</span><p><span class="cl">(Mishnah):</span> Its offspring and milk are permitted...</p></div>
<div class="indent1"><span class="nm">(i)</span><p><span class="cl">Question:</span> What is the case?</p></div>
<div class="indent2"><span class="nm">1.</span><p>If it became pregnant and gave birth after it was redeemed, this is obvious. The child is fully Chulin!</p></div>
<div class="indent1"><span class="nm">(j)</span><p><span class="cl">Answer:</span> It became pregnant before redemption and gave birth after redemption.</p></div>
<div class="indent1"><span class="nm">(k)</span><p><span class="cl">Inference:</span> Had it given birth before redemption, the child would be forbidden.</p></div>
<div class="bbbline">14b----------------------------------------14b</p></div>
<div class="indent1"><span class="nm">(l)</span><p><span class="cl">Question:</span> May the child be redeemed Tam (without a Mum), or only after it gets a Mum?</p></div>
<div class="indent1"><span class="nm">(m)</span><p><span class="cl">Answer (Beraisa):</span> If one was Makdish a Ba'al Mum Kavu'a for the Mizbe'ach and it gave birth, the child may be sold without a Mum. It does not get Kedushas Guf, because what is Tefel (secondary) should not be greater than the Ikar (what is primary, i.e. the mother).</p></div>
<div class="indent2"><span class="nm">1.</span><p><span class="cl">Inference:</span> It is not Kadosh because Tefel is not greater than the Ikar, but if a male was Hukdash for its value (to buy an Olah), it would have Kedushas ha'Guf!</p></div>
<div class="indent1"><span class="nm">(n)</span><p>This supports Rava;</p></div>
<div class="indent2"><span class="nm">1.</span><p><span class="cl">(Rava):</span> If a male was Hukdash for its value, it gets Kedushas ha'Guf.</p></div>
<div class="subject"><span class="nm">2)</span><p>A BA'AL MUM MAY NOT BE OFFERED</p></div>
<div class="indent1"><span class="nm">(a)</span><p><span class="cl">(Mishnah):</span> One who slaughters it outside is exempt.</p></div>
<div class="indent1"><span class="nm">(b)</span><p>R. Elazar's text in the Mishnah reads 'he is liable.' R. Elazar explains that this refers to slaughtering on a private Bamah;</p></div>
<div class="indent2"><span class="nm">1.</span><p><span class="cl">(R. Elazar) Question:</span> What is the source that one who slaughters a Ba'al Mum on a Bamas Yachid (at a time when Bamos are permitted) transgresses a Lav?</p></div>
<div class="indent2"><span class="nm">2.</span><p><span class="cl">Answer:</span> "Lo Sizbach la'Shem Elokecha Shor va'Seh (Asher Yihyeh Bo Mum)";</p></div>
<div class="indent3"><span class="nm">i.</span><p>We do not need this to forbid a Ba'al Mum on a Bamas Tzibur. "Averes Oh Shavur... " already forbids this. Therefore, it forbids on a Bamas Yachid.</p></div>
<div class="indent2"><span class="nm">3.</span><p><span class="cl">Question:</span> We should say since we do not need it for (regular) Kodshim on a Bamas Tzibur, it teaches about Bechor (on a Bamas Tzibur)!</p></div>
<div class="indent3"><span class="nm">i.</span><p>One might have thought that since a Ba'al Mum gets Kedushas Bechor (it is given to Kohanim, one may not shear it or work with it), it is like a Tam and may be offered -- "Lo Sizbach... " teaches that this is not so!</p></div>
<div class="indent2"><span class="nm">4.</span><p><span class="cl">Answer:</span> Another verse explicitly teaches about Bechor - "Pise'ach Oh Iver... Lo Sizbachenu."</p></div>
<div class="indent2"><span class="nm">5.</span><p><span class="cl">Question:</span> We should say since we do not need it for Kodshim on a Bamas Tzibur, it teaches about Ma'aser!</p></div>
<div class="indent3"><span class="nm">i.</span><p>A Ba'al Mum can become Ma'aser - "Lo Yevaker Bein Tov la'Ra." One might have thought that therefore, it may be offered;</p></div>
<div class="indent3"><span class="nm">ii.</span><p>"Lo Sizbach... " teaches that this is not so!</p></div>
<div class="indent2"><span class="nm">6.</span><p><span class="cl">Answer:</span> We learn about Ma'aser from a Gezeirah Shavah "Ha'avarah-Ha'avarah" from Bechor.</p></div>
<div class="indent2"><span class="nm">7.</span><p><span class="cl">Question:</span> We should say the verse teaches about Temurah!</p></div>
<div class="indent3"><span class="nm">i.</span><p>A Temurah can become Kodesh - "Lo Yachalifenu v'Lo Yamir (Oso Tov b'Ra)." One might have thought that therefore, it may be offered. "Lo Sizbach... " teaches that this is not so!</p></div>
<div class="indent2"><span class="nm">8.</span><p><span class="cl">Answer:</span> "v'Hayah Hu u'Semuraso Yihyeh Kodesh" equates Temurah to it (the Korban it was intended to replace):</p></div>
<div class="indent3"><span class="nm">i.</span><p>Just like it (regular Hekdesh) may not be offered if it has a Mum, also its Temurah.</p></div>
<div class="indent1"><span class="nm">(c)</span><p><span class="cl">Question (R. Zeira):</span> We should say that "Lo Sizbach" forbids offering a Vlad (offspring) of Kodshim that has a Mum!</p></div>
<div class="indent2"><span class="nm">1.</span><p>Since a Ba'al Mum born to a Korban becomes Kodesh, one might have thought that it can be offered. The verse teaches that this is not so!</p></div>
<div class="indent1"><span class="nm">(d)</span><p><span class="cl">Answer (Rava):</span> We already know this from Tana d'Vei R. Yishmael:</p></div>
<div class="indent2"><span class="nm">1.</span><p><span class="cl">(Beraisa - Tana d'Vei R. Yishmael):</span> (The following verse obligates bringing Korbanos to the Mikdash to be offered.) "Rak Kodoshecha" refers to Temuros. "Asher Yihyu Lecha" are Vlados Kodshim.</p></div>
<div class="indent2"><span class="nm">2.</span><p><span class="cl">(Rava):</span> They are equated to "u'Nedarecha". Just like a Neder may not be offered if it is a Ba'al Mum, also (Temuros and) Vlados Kodshim.</p></div>
<div class="indent1"><span class="nm">(e)</span><p><span class="cl">(Mishnah):</span> It cannot make Temurah.</p></div>
<div class="indent1"><span class="nm">(f)</span><p><span class="cl">Question:</span> What is the reason?</p></div>
<div class="indent1"><span class="nm">(g)</span><p><span class="cl">Answer - Question:</span> Why does it say "(Lo Yachalifenu... ) Tov b'Ra Oh Ra b'Tov"? Since one may not (try to) substitute a good animal (Tam) for a bad Korban (a Ba'al Mum), obviously one may not substitute a Ba'al Mum for a Tam!</p></div>
<div class="indent2"><span class="nm">1.</span><p><span class="cl">Answer:</span> Rather, "Tov b'Ra" teaches that only a Korban that was initially Tam can make Temurah.</p></div>
<div class="indent1"><span class="nm">(h)</span><p><span class="cl">(Mishnah):</span> If it died, it is redeemed.</p></div>
<div class="indent1"><span class="nm">(i)</span><p><span class="cl">(Rav):</span> Our Mishnah is like R. Shimon, who says that Ha'amadah and Ha'arachah apply to Kodshei Mizbe'ach (to be redeemed, they must be stood up alive in front of a Kohen for evaluation), but not to Kodshei Bedek ha'Bayis:</p></div>
<div class="indent2"><span class="nm">1.</span><p><span class="cl">(Mishnah - R. Shimon):</span> If (animals of) Kodshei Bedek ha'Bayis died, they are redeemed.</p></div>
<div class="indent1"><span class="nm">(j)</span><p><span class="cl">(Rav):</span> R. Shimon agrees that a Ba'al Mum me'Ikara (it had a Mum before it was Hukdash for the Mizbe'ach) is redeemed (if it died. Tosfos - really, it would be more accurate to say that Chachamim in that Mishnah, who require Ha'amadah and Ha'arachah for Kodshei Bedek ha'Bayis, agree about a Ba'al Mum me'Ikara. Rav says that R. Shimon agrees, for he surely permits it.)</p></div>
<div class="indent1"><span class="nm">(k)</span><p><span class="cl">Question:</span> What is his reason?</p></div>
<div class="indent1"><span class="nm">(l)</span><p><span class="cl">Answer:</span> "Osah" excludes a Ba'al Mum me'Ikara.</p></div>
<div class="indent1"><span class="nm">(m)</span><p><span class="cl">Chachamim (of that Mishnah):</span> If they (animals of Kodshei Bedek ha'Bayis) died, they must be buried.</p></div>
<div class="indent1"><span class="nm">(n)</span><p>(Rav established our Mishnah like R. Shimon. This implies that other Chachamim argue.)</p></div>
<div class="indent1"><span class="nm">(o)</span><p><span class="cl">Question:</span> Who are these Chachamim?</p></div>
<div class="indent1"><span class="nm">(p)</span><p><span class="cl">Answer:</span> They hold like Tana d'Vei Levi;</p></div>
<div class="indent2"><span class="nm">1.</span><p><span class="cl">(Tana d'Vei Levi):</span> Everything requires Ha'amadah and Ha'arachah, even a Ba'al Mum me'Ikara.</p></div>
<div class="indent2"><span class="nm">2.</span><p>Tana d'Vei Levi's text of the Mishnah says that everything requires Ha'amadah and Ha'arachah, even Chayos, even birds.</p></div>
<div class="indent2"><span class="nm">3.</span><p><span class="cl">Question:</span> "Osah" should exclude something!</p></div>
<div class="indent2"><span class="nm">4.</span><p>This is difficult according to Tana d'Vei Levi.</p></div>
