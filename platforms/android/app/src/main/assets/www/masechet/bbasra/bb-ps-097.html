<p class="bas subject"><span class="nm">1)</span>TEMED (cont.)</p>
<p class="bas indent1"><span class="nm">(a)</span><span class="cl">Question:</span> Is it really true that they argue about when more came out than was put in?!</p>
<p class="bas indent2"><span class="nm">1.</span><span class="cl">(Mishnah):</span> If one put water on dregs, and the same volume came out, it is exempt from Ma'aseros;</p>
<p class="bas indent2"><span class="nm">2.</span>R. Yehudah obligates.</p>
<p class="bas indent3"><span class="nm">i.</span>They argue only about when the same volume came out. If more came out, all obligate to take Ma'aseros!</p>
<p class="bas indent1"><span class="nm">(b)</span><span class="cl">Answer:</span> Really, they argue even about when more came out. The Beraisa discusses the case when the same volume came out to teach the extremity of R. Yehudah's opinion.</p>
<p class="bas indent1"><span class="nm">(c)</span><span class="cl">Question (Rav Nachman bar Yitzchak):</span> What is the blessing on dregs that have the taste of wine?</p>
<p class="bas indent1"><span class="nm">(d)</span><span class="cl">Answer (R. Chiya bar Avin):</span> (It is sheha'Kol.) It is not wine. It is a mere taste.</p>
<p class="bas indent1"><span class="nm">(e)</span><span class="cl">(Beraisa #1):</span> The first and second times that one puts water on dregs of Terumah wine, what come out is forbidden (like Terumah). The third time, it is permitted (like Chulin);</p>
<p class="bas indent1"><span class="nm">(f)</span>R. Meir says, even the third is forbidden if it tastes like wine.</p>
<p class="bas indent2"><span class="nm">1.</span>If one puts water on dregs of Ma'aser wine, (what comes out) the first time is forbidden (like Ma'aser, and the second time is permitted;</p>
<p class="bas indent2"><span class="nm">2.</span>R. Meir says, even the second is forbidden if it tastes like wine.</p>
<p class="bas indent2"><span class="nm">3.</span>If one puts water on dregs of Hekdesh, the first three times are forbidden. The fourth time, it is permitted;</p>
<p class="bas indent2"><span class="nm">4.</span>R. Meir says, even the fourth is forbidden if it tastes like wine.</p>
<p class="bas indent1"><span class="nm">(g)</span><span class="cl">Contradiction (Beraisa #2):</span> Dregs of Hekdesh are always forbidden. Dregs of Ma'aser are always permitted.</p>
<p class="bas indent2"><span class="nm">1.</span>Beraisa #1 says that the dregs are sometimes forbidden and sometimes permitted regarding Hekdesh and Ma'aser!</p>
<p class="bas indent1"><span class="nm">(h)</span><span class="cl">Answer (part 1, regarding Hekdesh):</span> Regarding Kedushas ha'Guf (something that is itself offered in the Mikdash, e.g. wine for Nesachim), the dregs are always forbidden. Regarding Kedushas Damim (their value is Hekdesh), only the first three times are forbidden.</p>
<p class="bas indent1"><span class="nm">(i)</span><span class="cl">Answer (part 2, regarding Ma'aser):</span> Regarding definite Ma'aser, the first time is forbidden. Regarding Ma'aser of Demai (Safek Tevel, i.e. perhaps it was already tithed and the Ma'aser is really Chulin), it is always permitted.</p>
<p class="bas indent1"><span class="nm">(j)</span><span class="cl">(R. Yochanan):</span> The law of Hechsher (food can become Tamei only after a liquid was put on it) is the same as the law of when the dregs are forbidden.</p>
<p class="bas indent1"><span class="nm">(k)</span><span class="cl">Question:</span> Which Hechsher does he address?</p>
<p class="bas indent2"><span class="nm">1.</span>Neither water nor wine needs any Hechsher!</p>
<p class="bas indent1"><span class="nm">(l)</span><span class="cl">Answer:</span> The case is, he put rainwater on the dregs. (Rainwater that was not willfully collected is not Machshir for Kabalas Tum'ah.)</p>
<p class="bas indent1"><span class="nm">(m)</span><span class="cl">Question:</span> Once he put the water in a Keli, this shows that he wants the water, so it is Huchshar!</p>
<p class="bas indent1"><span class="nm">(n)</span><span class="cl">Answer:</span> The rainwater fell on the dregs by itself.</p>
<p class="bas indent1"><span class="nm">(o)</span><span class="cl">Question:</span> The first time he removes the Temed, this shows that he is happy that the water fell there, so it is all Huchshar!</p>
<p class="bas indent1"><span class="nm">(p)</span><span class="cl">Answer (Rav Papa):</span> He did not remove the Temed. A cow was drinking it.</p>
<p class="bas subject"><span class="nm">2)</span>WINE FOR KIDUSH</p>
<p class="bas indent1"><span class="nm">(a)</span><span class="cl">(Rav):</span> One must make Kidush on wine fitting for Nesachim.</p>
<p class="bas indent1"><span class="nm">(b)</span><span class="cl">Question:</span> What does this come to exclude?</p>
<p class="bas indent2"><span class="nm">1.</span><span class="cl">Suggestion:</span> It excludes unfermented wine (grape juice).</p>
<p class="bas indent2"><span class="nm">2.</span><span class="cl">Rejection #1:</span> R. Chiya taught that one should not bring unfermented wine for Nesachim. If he brought it, it is Kosher;</p>
<p class="bas indent3"><span class="nm">i.</span>Since it is Kosher b'Diavad for Nesachim, it is Kosher l'Chatchilah for Kidush!</p>
<p class="bas bbbline">97b----------------------------------------97b</p>
<p class="bas indent2"><span class="nm">3.</span><span class="cl">Rejection #2:</span> Rava taught that one may squeeze grapes and make Kidush on the juice!</p>
<p class="bas indent1"><span class="nm">(c)</span><span class="cl">Answer #1:</span> It excludes wine from the top and bottom of the barrel.</p>
<p class="bas indent1"><span class="nm">(d)</span><span class="cl">Rejection:</span> R. Chiya taught that one should not bring such wine for Nesachim; if he did, it is Kosher (therefore, it is l'Chatchilah for Kidush).</p>
<p class="bas indent1"><span class="nm">(e)</span><span class="cl">Answer #2:</span> It excludes wine that is black, or white (and bad), or sweet (and weak), cellar wine (that was not checked; perhaps it is bad), and raisin wine (made by putting water on raisins).</p>
<p class="bas indent1"><span class="nm">(f)</span><span class="cl">Rejection (Beraisa):</span> One should not bring any of these for Nesachim. If he did, it is Kosher.</p>
<p class="bas indent1"><span class="nm">(g)</span><span class="cl">Answer #3:</span> It excludes wine that is Koses (it cannot intoxicate), diluted, was exposed, Temed, and wine that smells bad.</p>
<p class="bas indent2"><span class="nm">1.</span><span class="cl">(Beraisa):</span> One should not bring any of these for Nesachim. If he did, it is invalid.</p>
<p class="bas indent1"><span class="nm">(h)</span><span class="cl">Question:</span> Which of these did Rav come to teach about?</p>
<p class="bas indent2"><span class="nm">1.</span>Surely, he did not come to exclude Koses. R. Yochanan and R. Yehoshua ben Levi argued about this! (If Rav holds like R. Yochanan, it is proper wine (and Kosher for Kidush). If he holds like R. Yehoshua ben Levi, he should have said that one blesses sheha'Kol on it.)</p>
<p class="bas indent2"><span class="nm">2.</span>Surely, he did not come to exclude diluted wine. It is better for Kidush!</p>
<p class="bas indent3"><span class="nm">i.</span><span class="cl">(R. Yosi b'Rebbi Chanina):</span> Chachamim agree with R. Eliezer that we do not bless on the wine (after Birkas ha'Mazon) until adding water.</p>
<p class="bas indent2"><span class="nm">3.</span>Surely, he did not need to exclude exposed wine. It is dangerous, and one may not drink it!</p>
<p class="bas indent1"><span class="nm">(i)</span><span class="cl">Answer #1:</span> He comes to exclude Temed.</p>
<p class="bas indent1"><span class="nm">(j)</span><span class="cl">Objection:</span> What is the case?</p>
<p class="bas indent2"><span class="nm">1.</span>If he put in three measures of water and four came out, it is proper wine!</p>
<p class="bas indent2"><span class="nm">2.</span>If he put in three, and three and a half come out, Chachamim and 'Others' argue about this! (The Halachah follows Chachamim, that one blesses sheha'Kol on it.)</p>
<p class="bas indent1"><span class="nm">(k)</span><span class="cl">Answer #2:</span> He comes to exclude bad-smelling wine.</p>
<p class="bas indent1"><span class="nm">(l)</span><span class="cl">Answer #3:</span> Really, he comes to exclude exposed wine, even if one passed it through a strainer according to R. Nechemyah (that it is then permitted to drink);</p>
<p class="bas indent2"><span class="nm">1.</span>Still, it is invalid for Nesachim - "Hakrivehu Na l'Fechasecha..."</p>
<p class="bas indent1"><span class="nm">(m)</span><span class="cl">Question (Rav Kahana):</span> Is white wine acceptable for Kidush?</p>
<p class="bas indent1"><span class="nm">(n)</span><span class="cl">Answer (Rava):</span> No (it must be red) - "Al Tere Yayin Ki Yis'adam."</p>
<p class="bas indent1"><span class="nm">(o)</span><span class="cl">(Mishnah):</span> Bottles in Sharon...</p>
<p class="bas indent1"><span class="nm">(p)</span><span class="cl">(Beraisa):</span> The 10 Pitasos (bad bottles) of the Mishnah are usable and sealed with sulfur (but they were not baked properly (Rambam; Rashbam - they will not last long).</p>
