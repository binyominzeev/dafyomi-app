<p class="bas subject"><span class="nm">1)</span>KO'ACH OF KO'ACH</p>
<p class="bas indent1"><span class="nm">(a)</span><span class="cl">(Rav Papa):</span> If Reuven threw a clump of earth at a date tree, and it detached dates and they fell and killed someone, Rebbi obligates Galus, and Chachamim exempt.</p>
<p class="bas indent1"><span class="nm">(b)</span><span class="cl">Objection:</span> This is obvious!</p>
<p class="bas indent1"><span class="nm">(c)</span><span class="cl">Answer:</span> One might have thought that this is like Ko'ach (impetus) of his Ko'ach (since he was not touching the earth when it detached the dates), and Rebbi would agree that he is exempt.</p>
<p class="bas indent1"><span class="nm">(d)</span><span class="cl">Question:</span> What is a case of Ko'ach of his Ko'ach that Rebbi would agree is exempt?</p>
<p class="bas indent1"><span class="nm">(e)</span><span class="cl">Answer:</span> He threw a clump of earth, and it detached a branch, which fell and hit a cluster of dates and uprooted them, and they killed.</p>
<p class="bas subject"><span class="nm">2)</span>WHERE WAS THE VICTIM KILLED?</p>
<p class="bas indent1"><span class="nm">(a)</span><span class="cl">(Mishnah):</span> If Reuven threw a rock into Reshus ha'Rabim and it killed, he is exiled;</p>
<p class="bas indent1"><span class="nm">(b)</span>R. Eliezer ben Yakov says, if the victim stuck out his head after the rock left Reuven's hand, Reuven is exempt.</p>
<p class="bas indent1"><span class="nm">(c)</span>If Reuven threw a rock in his property and it killed, he is exiled only if the victim had permission to enter.</p>
<p class="bas indent2"><span class="nm">1.</span>"Va'Asher Yavo Es Re'ehu va'Ya'ar" - Galus applies only when the killer and victim both were allowed to be there, like in a forest;</p>
<p class="bas indent3"><span class="nm">i.</span>This excludes the killer's property, where the victim is forbidden to enter.</p>
<p class="bas indent2"><span class="nm">2.</span>Aba Sha'ul says, cutting wood is Reshus (optional, and not a Mitzvah) - Galus applies only to Reshus, and not to a father hitting his son, a Rebbi chastising a Talmid, or a Shali'ach of Beis Din (to lash).</p>
<p class="bas indent1"><span class="nm">(d)</span><span class="cl">(Gemara) Question:</span> If Reuven threw a rock into Reshus ha'Rabim, he is (close to) Mezid, he is not exiled!</p>
<p class="bas indent1"><span class="nm">(e)</span><span class="cl">Answer (Rav Shmuel bar Yitzchak):</span> The case is, Reuven destroyed his wall.</p>
<p class="bas indent1"><span class="nm">(f)</span><span class="cl">Question:</span> Still (he is close to Mezid), he should have looked if anyone is around!</p>
<p class="bas indent1"><span class="nm">(g)</span><span class="cl">Answer:</span> He destroyed it at night.</p>
<p class="bas indent1"><span class="nm">(h)</span><span class="cl">Question:</span> Still, he should have looked!</p>
<p class="bas indent1"><span class="nm">(i)</span><span class="cl">Answer:</span> He destroyed it into a waste area.</p>
<p class="bas indent1"><span class="nm">(j)</span><span class="cl">Question:</span> What is the case?</p>
<p class="bas indent2"><span class="nm">1.</span>If people often use it for a privy, he is close to Mezid!</p>
<p class="bas indent2"><span class="nm">2.</span>If people do not normally use it for a privy, he is close to Ones!</p>
<p class="bas indent1"><span class="nm">(k)</span><span class="cl">Answer (Rav Papa):</span> The case is, people often use it for a privy at night, but they do not <i>often</i> do so by day, but occasionally they do. Therefore he is neither Mezid nor Ones.</p>
<p class="bas indent1"><span class="nm">(l)</span><span class="cl">(Mishnah - R. Eliezer ben Yakov):</span> (If the victim stuck out his head... )</p>
<p class="bas indent1"><span class="nm">(m)</span><span class="cl">(Beraisa):</span> "U'Motza" excludes a case in which the victim brought himself to be damaged;</p>
<p class="bas indent1"><span class="nm">(n)</span>R. Eliezer ben Yakov learns from here that if the victim stuck out his head after the rock left Reuven's hand, Reuven is exempt.</p>
<p class="bas indent1"><span class="nm">(o)</span><span class="cl">Inference:</span> 'Motza' connotes finding something there from the beginning;</p>
<p class="bas indent1"><span class="nm">(p)</span><span class="cl">Contradiction (Beraisa):</span> "U'Motza" (he will acquire money) forbids selling a far-away or bad field (i.e. that he is not so eager to keep) in order to redeem (against the will of the buyer) a close or good field that he sold.</p>
<p class="bas indent1"><span class="nm">(q)</span><span class="cl">Answer (Rava):</span> We learn from the context of the verses;</p>
<p class="bas indent2"><span class="nm">1.</span>There, "u'Motza" resembles "v'Hisigah Yado" (surely, he did not have money when he sold, he acquired it only now);</p>
<p class="bas indent2"><span class="nm">2.</span>Here, "u'Motza" resembles the forest. It was there from the beginning.</p>
<p class="bas subject"><span class="nm">3)</span>RESHUS</p>
<p class="bas indent1"><span class="nm">(a)</span><span class="cl">(Mishnah):</span> If Reuven threw a rock ... (Aba Sha'ul says, cutting wood is Reshus... )</p>
<p class="bas indent1"><span class="nm">(b)</span><span class="cl">Version #1 - Question:</span> What is the source that the verse discusses cutting of Reshus? Perhaps he cuts for the sake of a Sukah, or to be burned on the Mizbe'ach (a Mitzvah), and even so, if he kills, he is exiled!</p>
<p class="bas indent1"><span class="nm">(c)</span><span class="cl">Answer #1 (Rava):</span> Those examples are not Mitzvos (they are only Hechsher (preparation for) Mitzvos);</p>
<p class="bas indent2"><span class="nm">1.</span>If he had wood already, there would be no Mitzvah to cut more. Therefore, even if he lacks wood, cutting is not a Mitzvah.</p>
<p class="bas indent1"><span class="nm">(d)</span><span class="cl">Question (Ravina - Mishnah):</span> This excludes a father hitting his son, a Rebbi chastising a Talmid, or a Shali'ach of Beis Din.</p>
<p class="bas indent2"><span class="nm">1.</span>We do not say that since if the son were learning properly, there would be no Mitzvah to hit him, even if he is not learning properly, there is no Mitzvah to hit him!</p>
<p class="bas indent1"><span class="nm">(e)</span><span class="cl">Answer:</span> It is always a Mitzvah to hit him - "Yaser Bincha vi'Nichecha." (Even Shleimah 6:2 - one should hit to correct even a small imperfection.)</p>
<p class="bas indent1"><span class="nm">(f)</span><span class="cl">Answer #2 (to Question (b) - Rava):</span> A better proof is from the verse "va'Asher Yavo (<i>if</i> he will come) Es Re'ehu va'Ya'ar." This does not discuss a Mitzvah, for then he must enter!</p>
<p class="bas indent1"><span class="nm">(g)</span><span class="cl">Question (Rav Ada bar Ahavah):</span> Does 'Asher' always refers to Reshus?!</p>
<p class="bas indent2"><span class="nm">1.</span>"V'Ish Asher Yitma" - is it always optional to become Tamei?! One must become Tamei for a Mes Mitzvah (an unattended corpse)!</p>
<p class="bas indent1"><span class="nm">(h)</span><span class="cl">Answer (Rava):</span> There is different, for it says "Tamei Yihyeh" - in any case (i.e. sometimes he must become Tamei).</p>
<p class="bas bbbline">8b----------------------------------------8b</p>
<p class="bas indent1"><span class="nm">(i)</span><span class="cl">Question:</span> We need that verse for a different law!</p>
<p class="bas indent2"><span class="nm">1.</span><span class="cl">(Beraisa):</span> "Tamei Yihyeh" includes a Tevul Yom. "Od Tum'aso Bo" includes a Mechushar Kipurim (if either of them enters the Mikdash, he is Chayav Kares).</p>
<p class="bas indent1"><span class="nm">(j)</span><span class="cl">Answer (Rava):</span> I learn from "Od" (this is extra, to teach that sometimes he must become Tamei).</p>
<p class="bas indent1"><span class="nm">(k)</span><span class="cl">Version #2 (Beraisa - R. Akiva) Question:</span> Why does it say "be'Charish uva'Katzir Tishbos"? "Sadcha Lo Sizra v'Charmecha Lo Sizmor" already forbids plowing and reaping in Shemitah</p>
<p class="bas indent2"><span class="nm">1.</span>Rather, this comes to forbid plowing in Erev Shemitah (so that in Shemitah, the land will be better), and to give Kedushas Shemitah to Peros reaped in Motzei Shemitah that were a third grown in Shemitah.</p>
<p class="bas indent2"><span class="nm">2.</span>R. Yishmael says, (the verse forbids plowing and reaping on Shabbos.) Just like plowing is Reshus, also reaping. This excludes reaping the Omer, which is a Mitzvah, and therefore it is permitted on Shabbos.</p>
<p class="bas indent1"><span class="nm">(l)</span><span class="cl">Question:</span> What is the source that the verse discusses plowing of Reshus? Perhaps he plows for the sake of the Omer (a Mitzvah), and even so, it is forbidden on Shabbos!</p>
<p class="bas indent1"><span class="nm">(m)</span><span class="cl">Answer #1 (Rava):</span> If he already had a plowed field, there would be no Mitzvah to plow another for the sake of the Omer. This shows that plowing for the Omer is not a Mitzvah!</p>
<p class="bas indent1"><span class="nm">(n)</span><span class="cl">Question (Ravina - Mishnah):</span> This excludes a father hitting his son, a Rebbi chastising a Talmid, or a Shali'ach of Beis Din.</p>
<p class="bas indent2"><span class="nm">1.</span><span class="cl">Inference:</span> Hitting one's son in order to teach him is considered a Mitzvah. We do not say that since if the son were learning properly, there would be no Mitzvah to hit him, there is never a Mitzvah to hit him!</p>
<p class="bas indent1"><span class="nm">(o)</span><span class="cl">Answer:</span> It is always a Mitzvah to hit a son, even if he is learning properly - "Yaser Bincha..."</p>
<p class="bas indent1"><span class="nm">(p)</span><span class="cl">Answer #2 ((to Question (l) - Rava):</span> I can answer better. If one already had a plowed field, he would never have a Mitzvah to plow another. Similarly, the Torah refers to the type of reaping that if one already had reaped his field, he would not have a Mitzvah to reap another. This excludes the reaping of the Omer, which is a Mitzvah. (This answer is better, for it teaches that there is never a Mitzvah to plow, not for the Omer or anything else.)</p>
<p class="bas subject"><span class="nm">4)</span>EXEMPTIONS FROM GALUS</p>
<p class="bas indent1"><span class="nm">(a)</span><span class="cl">(Mishnah):</span> A father can get Galus for killing his son. A son can get Galus for killing his father.</p>
<p class="bas indent1"><span class="nm">(b)</span>Anyone can get Galus for killing a Yisrael. A Yisrael can get Galus for killing anyone, except for a Ger Toshav (a Ben Noach who accepted to keep his Mitzvos);</p>
<p class="bas indent2"><span class="nm">1.</span>A Ger Toshav can (not - Gra deletes this) get Galus for killing a Ger Toshav.</p>
<p class="bas indent1"><span class="nm">(c)</span><span class="cl">(Gemara) Question:</span> The Mishnah says that a father can get Galus for killing his son. We said that it is always a Mitzvah for him to hit him!</p>
<p class="bas indent1"><span class="nm">(d)</span><span class="cl">Answer:</span> (It is always a Mitzvah when he teaches him Torah.) The case is, he was teaching him carpentry when he killed him.</p>
<p class="bas indent1"><span class="nm">(e)</span><span class="cl">Question:</span> It is also a Mitzvah to teach one's son a trade!</p>
<p class="bas indent1"><span class="nm">(f)</span><span class="cl">Answer:</span> The case is, the son already knew a trade.</p>
<p class="bas indent1"><span class="nm">(g)</span><span class="cl">(Mishnah):</span> A son can get Galus for killing his father.</p>
<p class="bas indent1"><span class="nm">(h)</span><span class="cl">Contradiction (Beraisa):</span> "Makeh Nefesh" excludes one who strikes his father.</p>
<p class="bas indent1"><span class="nm">(i)</span><span class="cl">Answer #1 (Rav Kahana):</span> The Beraisa is like R. Shimon. The Mishnah is like Chachamim.</p>
<p class="bas indent2"><span class="nm">1.</span>R. Shimon says that choking is more stringent than beheading. Galus atones for killing (anyone but a parent) b'Shogeg, for this is punishable by beheading (if done b'Mezid);</p>
<p class="bas indent3"><span class="nm">i.</span>It does not atone for killing a parent, which is more stringent (even wounding a parent is punishable by choking)!</p>
<p class="bas indent2"><span class="nm">2.</span>Chachamim say that choking is less stringent than beheading. Also killing a parent is punished by beheading, so Galus atones for it.</p>
<p class="bas indent1"><span class="nm">(j)</span><span class="cl">Answer #2 (Rava):</span> The Beraisa teaches that one who wounds a parent is not exiled;</p>
<p class="bas indent2"><span class="nm">1.</span>One might have thought that since one is killed for doing it b'Mezid, he is exiled for Shogeg. The Beraisa teaches that this is not so.</p>
<p class="bas indent1"><span class="nm">(k)</span><span class="cl">(Mishnah):</span> Anyone can get Galus for killing a Yisrael...</p>
<p class="bas indent1"><span class="nm">(l)</span><span class="cl">Question:</span> What does this come to include?</p>
<p class="bas indent1"><span class="nm">(m)</span><span class="cl">Answer:</span> It includes a slave and Nochri.</p>
<p class="bas indent1"><span class="nm">(n)</span>Our Mishnah alludes to what a Beraisa teaches.</p>
<p class="bas indent2"><span class="nm">1.</span><span class="cl">(Beraisa):</span> A slave or Nochri is exiled (for doing one thing to a Yisrael,) and he is lashed for (doing something else to) a Yisrael. A Yisrael is exiled, and is lashed for (doing things to) a slave or Nochri.</p>
<p class="bas indent2"><span class="nm">2.</span><span class="cl">Question:</span> Granted, a slave or Nochri is exiled for killing a Yisrael, and he is lashed for cursing him. A Yisrael is exiled for killing a slave or Nochri. However, how is a Yisrael lashed due to a slave or Nochri?</p>
<p class="bas indent3"><span class="nm">i.</span>There is no Lav against cursing him - "v'Nasi <i>b'Amcha</i> Lo Sa'or" (only people of your nation)!</p>
<p class="bas indent2"><span class="nm">3.</span><span class="cl">Answer #1 (Rav Acha bar Yakov):</span> The case is, he testified about him and he was Huzam.</p>
<p class="bas indent2"><span class="nm">4.</span><span class="cl">Rejection:</span> Surely, he is lashed for the same reason as the slave or Nochri (in the Reisha). They cannot testify!</p>
<p class="bas indent2"><span class="nm">5.</span><span class="cl">Answer #2 (Rav Acha brei d'Rav Ika):</span> The case is, the Yisrael hit him, and the monetary compensation for the wound would have been less than a Perutah;</p>
<p class="bas indent3"><span class="nm">i.</span><span class="cl">(R. Ami):</span> If Reuven wounded Shimon and the compensation would be less than a Perutah , he is lashed instead;</p>
<p class="bas indent3"><span class="nm">ii.</span>We do not equate wounding to cursing (to say that it applies only to Amcha).</p>
