<div class="subject"><span class="nm">1)</span><p>A MECHITZAH THAT CAME ABOUT BY ITSELF</p></div>
<div class="indent1"><span class="nm">(a)</span><p><span class="cl">(Abaye):</span> A Lechi that came about by itself (it was not made for this purpose) is a [valid] Lechi;</p></div>
<div class="indent1"><span class="nm">(b)</span><p><span class="cl">(Rava):</span> It is not a Lechi.</p></div>
<div class="indent1"><span class="nm">(c)</span><p>All agree that if we did not rely on it from before Shabbos (e.g. there was another Lechi) that it is not a Lechi;</p></div>
<div class="indent2"><span class="nm">1.</span><p>They argue about when we relied on it from before Shabbos. Abaye is Machshir, for we relied on it from before Shabbos;</p></div>
<div class="indent2"><span class="nm">2.</span><p>Rava is Posel, because it was not initially made to be a Lechi.</p></div>
<div class="indent1"><span class="nm">(d)</span><p>We are thinking that they likewise argue about a Mechitzah that was not built to be a Mechitzah. (All of the following questions are against Rava.)</p></div>
<div class="indent1"><span class="nm">(e)</span><p><span class="cl">Question (Mishnah):</span> If one built a Sukah between trees, and they are its walls, it is Kosher.</p></div>
<div class="indent1"><span class="nm">(f)</span><p><span class="cl">Answer:</span> The case is, they were planted for this purpose.</p></div>
<div class="indent1"><span class="nm">(g)</span><p><span class="cl">Question:</span> If so, obviously it is Kosher!</p></div>
<div class="indent1"><span class="nm">(h)</span><p><span class="cl">Answer:</span> One might have thought that we decree to forbid, lest one use a tree [on Shabbos or Yom Tov]. The Mishnah teaches that we do not decree.</p></div>
<div class="indent1"><span class="nm">(i)</span><p><span class="cl">Question (Beraisa):</span> If there is a tree, fence or Chitzas ha'Kanim (reeds growing out of a common stump) where one wants to put Pasei Bira'os (planks surrounding a well, which permit carrying inside - 17b), one may use them for the corner posts.</p></div>
<div class="indent1"><span class="nm">(j)</span><p><span class="cl">Answer:</span> Here also, they were planted for this purpose.</p></div>
<div class="indent1"><span class="nm">(k)</span><p><span class="cl">Question:</span> If so, obviously one may use them!</p></div>
<div class="indent1"><span class="nm">(l)</span><p><span class="cl">Answer:</span> The Chidush is that the reeds are separated by less than three Tefachim (we rely on Lavud), like Abaye's question (19b. The Chidush of the tree can be like above (h), or that we consider it as if it was carved to the proper shape.)</p></div>
<div class="indent1"><span class="nm">(m)</span><p><span class="cl">Question (Mishnah):</span> If the foliage of a tree hangs within three Tefachim of the ground, one may carry under it.</p></div>
<div class="indent1"><span class="nm">(n)</span><p><span class="cl">Answer:</span> Here also, it was planted for this purpose.</p></div>
<div class="indent1"><span class="nm">(o)</span><p><span class="cl">Question:</span> If so, there should be no limit to the area enclosed. However, Rav Huna brei d'Rav Yehoshua taught that one may carry only if the area is at most Beis Sa'atayim (5000 square Amos)!</p></div>
<div class="indent1"><span class="nm">(p)</span><p><span class="cl">Answer:</span> That is because it is a Dirah for the sake of Avir (what is outside itself, e.g. to guard produce). One may not carry in such a Dirah if it exceeds Beis Sa'atayim.</p></div>
<div class="indent1"><span class="nm">(q)</span><p><span class="cl">Question (Beraisa):</span> If one made his Shevisah (residence for Shabbos) on a mound 10 Tefachim tall extending between four Amos and Beis Sa'atayim, or in a cleft in a rock 10 deep and four wide, or in a harvested area surrounded by [attached] sheaves (10 Tefachim tall and tied so they do not blow in the wind - Mishnah Berurah), he may traverse the entire place and 2000 Amos in every direction.</p></div>
<div class="indent1"><span class="nm">(r)</span><p><span class="cl">Suggestion:</span> Here also, they were made for this purpose.</p></div>
<div class="indent1"><span class="nm">(s)</span><p><span class="cl">Rejection:</span> This could answer for sheaves, but not for a mound or cleft! (They were there from Creation.)</p></div>
<div class="subject"><span class="nm">2)</span><p>A LECHI THAT CAME ABOUT BY ITSELF</p></div>
<div class="indent1"><span class="nm">(a)</span><p><span class="cl">Retraction:</span> Rather, Rava agrees that a Mechitzah need not be made for that purpose. He argues only about a Lechi:</p></div>
<div class="indent2"><span class="nm">1.</span><p>Also elsewhere (5a), Abaye holds that a Lechi is considered a Mechitzah. Therefore, it need not be made for this purpose;</p></div>
<div class="indent2"><span class="nm">2.</span><p>Also elsewhere (12b), Rava holds that a Lechi is a Heker. It is a Heker only if it was made for this purpose.</p></div>
<div class="indent1"><span class="nm">(b)</span><p><span class="cl">Question (Beraisa):</span> If rocks jut out of a stone wall (they are staggered, one on top of another; the top one is at least 10 Tefachim high), another Lechi is needed only if there is three Tefachim between two successive rocks or between the bottom rock and the ground.</p></div>
<div class="indent1"><span class="nm">(c)</span><p><span class="cl">Answer:</span> Here also, [we assume that] they were built this way for this purpose.</p></div>
<div class="indent1"><span class="nm">(d)</span><p><span class="cl">Question:</span> If so, obviously it is Kosher!</p></div>
<div class="indent1"><span class="nm">(e)</span><p><span class="cl">Answer:</span> One might have thought that they were built to enable extending the wall. The Beraisa teaches that this is not so.</p></div>
<div class="indent1"><span class="nm">(f)</span><p><span class="cl">Question (R. Chiya - Beraisa):</span> If one side of [the thickness of] a wall is recessed from the other, whether it is Nir'eh miba'Chutz v'Shavah mibi'Fnim or Nir'eh mibi'Fnim v'Shavah miba'Chutz, it is considered a Lechi.</p></div>
<div class="indent1"><span class="nm">(g)</span><p><span class="cl">Answer:</span> Here also, it was built this way for this purpose.</p></div>
<div class="indent1"><span class="nm">(h)</span><p><span class="cl">Question:</span> If so, obviously it is Kosher!</p></div>
<div class="indent1"><span class="nm">(i)</span><p><span class="cl">Answer:</span> The Chidush is that Nir'eh miba'Chutz v'Shavah mibi'Fnim is considered a Lechi.</p></div>
<div class="indent1"><span class="nm">(j)</span><p><span class="cl">Question:</span> A case occurred in which Rav was sitting in a Mavoy and asked his attendant to bring a cup of water. Before he returned, the Lechi fell. Rav gestured to the attendant to stand still.</p></div>
<div class="indent2"><span class="nm">1.</span><p><span class="cl">Rav Huna:</span> Why don't you rely on the date tree for a Lechi?</p></div>
<div class="indent2"><span class="nm">2.</span><p><span class="cl">Rav:</span> That was a foolish suggestion. We did not rely on it from before Shabbos!</p></div>
<div class="indent2"><span class="nm">3.</span><p><span class="cl">Inference:</span> Had they relied on it from before Shabbos, it would be a Lechi! (We ask from Rav like from a Beraisa, for all Chachamim of Bavel were Talmidim of Rav or Shmuel, or of later generations of their Talmidim.)</p></div>
<div class="indent1"><span class="nm">(k)</span><p><span class="cl">Suggestion:</span> Abaye and Rava argue about when one did not rely on it from before Shabbos, but if he did, all agree that it is a Lechi!</p></div>
<div class="indent1"><span class="nm">(l)</span><p><span class="cl">Rejection:</span> A beam supporting a certain shed was at the end of a Mavoy, and Abaye and Rava argued about it their entire lifetimes. (We concluded like Abaye. This is one of the six places where the Halachah follows Abaye against Rava.)</p></div>
<div class="subject"><span class="nm">3)</span><p>THINGS FOR WHICH LIVING BEINGS MAY NOT BE USED</p></div>
<div class="indent1"><span class="nm">(a)</span><p><span class="cl">(Mishnah):</span> A Lechi may be made of anything, even if it is alive;</p></div>
<div class="indent1"><span class="nm">(b)</span><p>R. Meir forbids something alive.</p></div>
<div class="indent1"><span class="nm">(c)</span><p>If something alive was used for a Golel (Rashi - a coffin cover; Tosfos - a monument marking the location of a grave), it is Metamei;</p></div>
<div class="bbbline">15b----------------------------------------15b</p></div>
<div class="indent1"><span class="nm">(d)</span><p>R. Meir is Metaher.</p></div>
<div class="indent1"><span class="nm">(e)</span><p>One may write a Get (divorce document) on something alive;</p></div>
<div class="indent1"><span class="nm">(f)</span><p>R. Yosi ha'Gelili disqualifies such a Get.</p></div>
<div class="indent1"><span class="nm">(g)</span><p><span class="cl">(Gemara - Beraisa - R. Meir):</span> Something alive cannot be used for a Sukah wall, a Lechi, Pasei Bira'os, nor a Golel for a grave;</p></div>
<div class="indent1"><span class="nm">(h)</span><p>R. Yosi ha'Gelili says, also, one may not write a Get on it.</p></div>
<div class="indent1"><span class="nm">(i)</span><p><span class="cl">Question:</span> What is his reason?</p></div>
<div class="indent1"><span class="nm">(j)</span><p><span class="cl">Answer (Beraisa) Question:</span> [One divorces with a] "Sefer." What is the source to include [writing on] anything?</p></div>
<div class="indent2"><span class="nm">1.</span><p><span class="cl">Answer:</span> "V'Chosav Lah" includes everything.</p></div>
<div class="indent2"><span class="nm">2.</span><p><span class="cl">Question:</span> If so, why does it say "Sefer"?</p></div>
<div class="indent2"><span class="nm">3.</span><p><span class="cl">Answer:</span> This teaches that a Get must be written on something like a Sefer, i.e. it is not alive and it is not a food.</p></div>
<div class="indent2"><span class="nm">4.</span><p><span class="cl">Chachamim:</span> Had the Torah said "b'Sefer", we would agree. However, it says "Sefer." This refers to Sefiras Devarim. (The Get must tell how he divorces her.)</p></div>
<div class="indent2"><span class="nm">5.</span><p><span class="cl">Question:</span> What do Chachamim learn from "v'Chosav Lah"?</p></div>
<div class="indent2"><span class="nm">6.</span><p><span class="cl">Answer:</span> This teaches that he divorces through writing, and not through money;</p></div>
<div class="indent3"><span class="nm">i.</span><p>One might have thought that since a verse equates divorce to engagement; just like money can be Mekadesh, it can divorce. The verse teaches that this is not so.</p></div>
<div class="indent2"><span class="nm">7.</span><p>R. Yosi ha'Gelili learns this from "Sefer Kerisus" - only a Sefer severs [marriage];</p></div>
<div class="indent2"><span class="nm">8.</span><p>Chachamim learn from "Sefer Kerisus" that the Get must cut them off from each other. (It cannot have a condition that she must guard for the rest of her life);</p></div>
<div class="indent3"><span class="nm">i.</span><p><span class="cl">(Beraisa):</span> A divorce 'on condition that you will never drink wine', or 'on condition that you will never go to your father's house' is invalid;</p></div>
<div class="indent3"><span class="nm">ii.</span><p>If the condition is only for 30 days, the Get is valid.</p></div>
<div class="indent2"><span class="nm">9.</span><p>R. Yosi ha'Gelili expounds the plural "Kerisus" to teach [also] this. It could have said 'Kares' to teach [only] the above law;</p></div>
<div class="indent2"><span class="nm">10.</span><p>Chachamim hold that the plural form does not warrant teaching another law.</p></div>
<div class="subject"><span class="nm">4)</span><p>PARUTZ K'OMED</p></div>
<div class="indent1"><span class="nm">(a)</span><p><span class="cl">(Mishnah):</span> If a caravan camped in a valley and surrounded it with Kelim used for animals (e.g. saddles; even though one is not Mevatel them, it is a Mechitzah - Tif'eres Yisrael), one may carry inside, as long as it is 10 Tefachim tall and the area of the gaps does not exceed that of the Kelim;</p></div>
<div class="indent1"><span class="nm">(b)</span><p>A gap up to 10 Amos is permitted. More than this forbids.</p></div>
<div class="indent1"><span class="nm">(c)</span><p><span class="cl">(Gemara - Rav Papa):</span> Parutz k'Omed (the width of the gaps equals that of the wall) permits;</p></div>
<div class="indent1"><span class="nm">(d)</span><p><span class="cl">(Rav Huna brei d'Rav Yehoshua):</span> It does not permit.</p></div>
<div class="indent1"><span class="nm">(e)</span><p>Rav Papa permits. He holds that Hash-m taught Moshe that if the majority is open, it is not a Mechitzah;</p></div>
<div class="indent1"><span class="nm">(f)</span><p>Rav Huna permits. He holds that Hash-m taught Moshe that if the majority stands, it is a Mechitzah. (The following questions are against Rav Huna.)</p></div>
<div class="indent1"><span class="nm">(g)</span><p><span class="cl">Question (Mishnah):</span> The gaps cannot exceed the width of the Kelim.</p></div>
<div class="indent2"><span class="nm">1.</span><p><span class="cl">Inference:</span> If they are equal, it is permitted!</p></div>
<div class="indent1"><span class="nm">(h)</span><p><span class="cl">Answer:</span> It should say, if the width of the Kelim exceeds that of the gaps, it is permitted.</p></div>
<div class="indent1"><span class="nm">(i)</span><p><span class="cl">Question:</span> This implies that if they are equal, it is forbidden. If so, it should have said 'as long as the gaps are not as much as the Kelim'!</p></div>
<div class="indent1"><span class="nm">(j)</span><p>This is left difficult.</p></div>
<div class="indent1"><span class="nm">(k)</span><p><span class="cl">Question (Mishnah):</span> If one roofed his Sukah with roasting spits or bed boards [which are Pasul for Sechach], if the spaces between them are as big as them [and are covered with Kosher Sechach], it is Kosher. If not, it is Pasul.</p></div>
<div class="indent1"><span class="nm">(l)</span><p><span class="cl">Answer:</span> The case is, there is room between spits to insert and remove spits with leeway. (I.e., the spaces are slightly bigger.)</p></div>
<div class="indent1"><span class="nm">(m)</span><p><span class="cl">Version #1 (Rashi) Objection:</span> It is possible to make the spaces equal the spits! [Therefore, surely they are equal, like the Mishnah says.]</p></div>
<div class="indent1"><span class="nm">(n)</span><p><span class="cl">Answer #1 (R. Ami):</span> He [intentionally] left room between spits to insert and remove spits with leeway.</p></div>
<div class="indent1"><span class="nm">(o)</span><p><span class="cl">Version #2 (Tosfos) Objection:</span> It is impossible to totally fill all the spaces [with Kosher Sechach. Therefore, it is the minority. Everyone should disqualify the Sukah!]</p></div>
<div class="indent1"><span class="nm">(p)</span><p><span class="cl">Answer #1 (R. Ami):</span> He puts extra layers of Kosher Sechach. In this way one can fill all the spaces. (end of Version #2)</p></div>
<div class="indent1"><span class="nm">(q)</span><p><span class="cl">Answer #2 (Rava):</span> The Kosher Sechach is placed perpendicular to [and on top of] the Pasul Sechach. (It must be bigger in order to stay up.)</p></div>
