<p class="bas indent1"><span class="nm">(a)</span><span class="cl">(Continuation of Beraisa):</span> Regarding all Matanos, the giver has Tovas Hana'ah (like we now explain):</p>
<p class="bas indent2"><span class="nm">1.</span>If a Yisrael separated Terumah, and Reuven (another Yisrael) offered him some money on condition that he will give the Terumah to a particular Kohen, e.g. Reuven's grandson, this is permitted.</p>
<p class="bas indent2"><span class="nm">2.</span>A Kohen (Shimon) may not make such an offer to a Yisrael. (Since the Matanos could be given to Shimon himself, this resembles a Kohen helping in the granary.)</p>
<p class="bas indent1"><span class="nm">(b)</span><span class="cl">Question:</span> Why does the Tana illustrate only Terumah?</p>
<p class="bas indent1"><span class="nm">(c)</span><span class="cl">Answer:</span> Terumah has Kedushas ha'Guf (intrinsic Kedushah). The Kohen will not err to think that it became Chulin through a redemptive "sale";</p>
<p class="bas indent2"><span class="nm">1.</span>Bechor (Ba'al Mum) and Zero'a, Lechayayim and Kevah are Kedushas Damim (only its value has Kedushah). The Kohen might think that they became Chulin through this "sale" (Rashi - and he will not eat them with the proper grandeur; R. Gershom - he might feed them to dogs.)</p>
<p class="bas subject"><span class="nm">2)</span>TERUMAS CHUTZ LA'ARETZ</p>
<p class="bas indent1"><span class="nm">(a)</span><span class="cl">(Rava):</span> We are not concerned about a Kohen helping in the granary regarding Terumah of Chutz la'Aretz (which is mid'Rabanan).</p>
<p class="bas indent1"><span class="nm">(b)</span>Rav Chama would give it to his servant (in lieu of wages).</p>
<p class="bas indent1"><span class="nm">(c)</span><span class="cl">(Shmuel):</span> Terumas Chutz la'Aretz is Batel in a simple majority of Chulin. (Tosfos - a Tamei Kohen may eat it, but a Zar may not, unless there is 100 times as much Chulin as Terumah. Rashi - it is permitted even to Zarim.)</p>
<p class="bas indent2"><span class="nm">1.</span>Rabah (a Kohen) would Mevatel it (in a majority of Chulin), and eat it when he was Tamei.</p>
<p class="bas indent1"><span class="nm">(d)</span>When Rav Huna brei d'Rav Yehoshua received Terumah wine (of Chutz la'Aretz), he would Mevatel one ladle-full in two ladles of Chulin, (and remove one ladle from the mixture and treat it like Chulin; the Rambam's text omits this);</p>
<p class="bas indent2"><span class="nm">1.</span>From then on, he would (always consider the two (Rambam - three) remaining ladles to be Chulin, and) mix in a ladle (of Terumah, to Mevatel it,) and remove a ladle (and treat it like Chulin).</p>
<p class="bas indent1"><span class="nm">(e)</span><span class="cl">(Shmuel):</span> One may eat Tevel of Chutz la'Aretz, and leave over (Tosfos - a bit more than) the amount needed for Terumah and later designate (Tosfos - from) the remainder to be Terumah.</p>
<p class="bas indent1"><span class="nm">(f)</span><span class="cl">(Shmuel):</span> A Tamei Kohen may eat Terumas Chutz la'Aretz, unless the Tum'ah comes from the Kohen's own body (e.g. a Zav or Nidah);</p>
<p class="bas indent2"><span class="nm">1.</span>Even such Teme'im are forbidden only to eat it, but they may touch it.</p>
<p class="bas indent1"><span class="nm">(g)</span><span class="cl">(Ravina):</span> Therefore, a Nidah may separate Chalah for a young Kohen to eat. (A boy under nine cannot have an emission. Some permit also an adult Kohen who immersed after his last emission);</p>
<p class="bas indent2"><span class="nm">1.</span>If no young Kohen is around, she takes it with a rod (used to stoke coals) and burns it. (Rashi - after calling it Chalah, we minimize its contact with Tum'ah. Tosfos - she uses the rod to put it amidst the coals. Alternatively, she burns it right after removing it from the wall of the oven);</p>
<p class="bas indent2"><span class="nm">2.</span>She then separates a second Chalah, and gives it to any adult Kohen to eat. This is so people will not forget the (primary) Mitzvah of Chalah.</p>
<p class="bas indent1"><span class="nm">(h)</span>Rav Nachman, Rav Amram and Rami bar Chama were on a ship. Rav Amram went to relieve himself. A woman came and asked if one may eat Terumas Chutz la'Aretz after immersing from Tum'as Mes, before nightfall.</p>
<p class="bas indent1"><span class="nm">(i)</span><span class="cl">Rav Nachman:</span> We do not have Mei Chatas nowadays (in Bavel. Rashi - therefore he need not wait until night; Tosfos - he does not even need Tevilah.)</p>
<p class="bas bbbline">27b----------------------------------------27b</p>
<p class="bas indent1"><span class="nm">(j)</span><span class="cl">Rami bar Chama:</span> You should wait until Rav Amram returns before ruling!</p>
<p class="bas indent1"><span class="nm">(k)</span>Rav Amram returned.</p>
<p class="bas indent1"><span class="nm">(l)</span><span class="cl">(Rav Amram citing Rav):</span> A Tamei Mes may immerse and eat Terumas Chutz la'Aretz immediately.</p>
<p class="bas indent1"><span class="nm">(m)</span>The Halachah is not like Rav. (Tosfos - he need not immerse. Rashi - he must immerse and wait until night.)</p>
<p class="bas indent1"><span class="nm">(n)</span><span class="cl">(Mar Zutra):</span> One who becomes Tamei through a Sheretz may immerse and eat Terumas Chutz la'Aretz immediately.</p>
<p class="bas indent1"><span class="nm">(o)</span>The Halachah is not like Mar Zutra.</p>
<p class="bas subject"><span class="nm">3)</span>A <i>BECHOR</i> IS EATEN WITHIN ITS YEAR</p>
<p class="bas indent1"><span class="nm">(a)</span><span class="cl">(Mishnah):</span> A Bechor is eaten within the year...</p>
<p class="bas indent1"><span class="nm">(b)</span><span class="cl">Inference:</span> The Mishnah continues "if it developed a Mum within <i>its</i> year... " This implies that we consider a year from its birth (as opposed to a calendar year, from Tishrei until Elul).</p>

<p class="bas indent2"><span class="nm">2.</span><span class="cl">Answer:</span> The year from its birth enters the next calendar year, from Tishrei until Elul.</p>
<p class="bas indent1"><span class="nm">(e)</span><span class="cl">(Bei Rav (Shitah Mekubetzes - Bei Rebbi) - Beraisa):</span> "Shanah v'Shanah" teaches that one day in a year is considered a year;</p>
