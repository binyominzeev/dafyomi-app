<div class="indent1"><span class="nm">(a)</span><p><span class="cl">Question:</span> The Mishnah says that only relatives do Keri'ah, etc. But there is a Beraisa that says that when a rabbi dies everyone does Keri'ah, baring of the shoulder, and the eating of the mourner's meal.</p></div>
<div class="indent1"><span class="nm">(b)</span><p><span class="cl">Answer:</span> The Mishnah is talking about ordinary people, not rabbis.</p></div>
<div class="indent1"><span class="nm">(c)</span><p><span class="cl">Question:</span> The Mishnah says that only relatives do Keri'ah. But there is a Beraisa that one shoud weep and mourn over any decent fellow.</p></div>

<div class="indent1"><span class="nm">(e)</span><p><span class="cl">Question:</span> The Mishnah says that only relatives do Keri'ah. But there is a Beraisa that says that anyone who is present at the time of death of any Jew must do Keri'ah, for it is not worse than seeing a Sefer Torah destroyed (see below, 26a).</p></div>

<div class="indent1"><span class="nm">(b)</span><p>R. Huna died. Lessons:</p></div>
<div class="indent2"><span class="nm">1.</span><p>It is not proper to put a Sefer Torah on the bier, just as one should not sit on the same bed as a Sefer Torah while he is alive.</p></div>
<div class="indent2"><span class="nm">2.</span><p>If the rabbi's bier doesn't fit through the door, one should not pass it out through the roof (it's disrespectful), nor should he move the deceased to a new bier. The doorway must be widened.</p></div>
<div class="indent2"><span class="nm">3.</span><p>When a body is brought from another, faraway place, if the body is intact it is accorded full honors (Shurah, Bircas Aveilim, consolation visits). If it is not intact, it is not accorded these honors.</p></div>
