<p class="bas subject"><span class="nm">1)</span>WHICH ASPECTS OF <i>YIBUM</i> REQUIRE PROPER <i>BI'AH</i></p>
<p class="bas indent1"><span class="nm">(a)</span><span class="cl">(Mishnah):</span> (Whether the Yavam was Shogeg or Mezid...) whether he did Ha'ara'ah or full Bi'ah, he acquired her.</p>
<p class="bas indent1"><span class="nm">(b)</span><span class="cl">Question:</span> (If one did Yibum without intent,) regarding what does he acquire?</p>
<p class="bas indent1"><span class="nm">(c)</span><span class="cl">Answer #	1 (Rav):</span> He acquires in all respects.</p>
<p class="bas indent1"><span class="nm">(d)</span><span class="cl">Answer #2 (Shmuel):</span> He acquires only regarding what is written in the Parashah, i.e. to inherit his brother and to exempt her from Yibum (if he dies with children).</p>
<p class="bas indent1"><span class="nm">(e)</span><span class="cl">Version #1:</span> If she fell to Yibum from Nisu'in, all agree that she eats (Terumah), since she ate before. They argue about when she fell from Kidushin;</p>
<p class="bas indent2"><span class="nm">1.</span>Rav says that she eats, since the Torah considers Bi'as Shogeg like Mezid;</p>
<p class="bas indent2"><span class="nm">2.</span>Shmuel says, it is considered Bi'ah to make the Yavam like the deceased husband, but not to make him stronger!</p>
<p class="bas indent1"><span class="nm">(f)</span>This is consistent with another teaching of Shmuel.</p>
<p class="bas indent2"><span class="nm">1.</span><span class="cl">(Shmuel):</span> The Yavam permits her to eat (Terumah, through substandard Bi'ah) only if the deceased husband permitted her.</p>
<p class="bas indent1"><span class="nm">(g)</span><span class="cl">Question (Beraisa):</span> If a Kohen was Mekadesh a Bas Yisrael and he became deaf before Nisu'in, she does not eat. If he died and she fell to Yibum to a deaf brother, she eats. In this case the Yavam is stronger than the first husband.</p>
<p class="bas indent2"><span class="nm">1.</span>This is like Rav and unlike Shmuel!</p>
<p class="bas indent1"><span class="nm">(h)</span><span class="cl">Answer:</span> The Beraisa means, if he did not do Nisu'in before he became deaf, she does not eat. If he did Nisu'in and then became deaf, she eats. If he died and she fell to Yibum to a deaf brother, she eats.</p>
<p class="bas indent1"><span class="nm">(i)</span><span class="cl">Question:</span> Why does it say 'in this case...'? (Also a deaf husband permits her!)</p>
<p class="bas indent1"><span class="nm">(j)</span><span class="cl">Answer:</span> If her husband was deaf from the beginning, he would not permit her. The Yavam permits her even if he was always deaf.</p>
<p class="bas indent1"><span class="nm">(k)</span><span class="cl">Version #2:</span> If she fell to Yibum from Kidushin, all agree that she does not eat, since she did not eat in the life of her husband. They argue about when she fell from Nisu'in;</p>
<p class="bas indent2"><span class="nm">1.</span>Rav says that she eats, since she ate before.</p>
<p class="bas indent2"><span class="nm">2.</span>Shmuel says, the Torah considers Bi'as Shogeg like Mezid only regarding things written in the Parashah.</p>
<p class="bas indent1"><span class="nm">(l)</span><span class="cl">Contradiction (Shmuel):</span> Whenever the deceased husband permitted her to eat, the Yavam permits her.</p>
<p class="bas indent1"><span class="nm">(m)</span><span class="cl">Correction:</span> Shmuel taught that the Yavam permits her to eat only with the kind of Bi'ah with which the husband (when he did Chupah) permits her.</p>
<p class="bas indent1"><span class="nm">(n)</span><span class="cl">Question (Beraisa):</span> If a Kohen was Mekadesh a Bas Yisrael and he became deaf before Nisu'in, she does not eat. If he died and she fell to Yibum to a deaf brother, she eats. In this case the Yavam is stronger than the first husband.</p>
<p class="bas indent1"><span class="nm">(o)</span><span class="cl">Answer:</span> Rav can answer like we answered for Shmuel in Version #1.</p>
<p class="bas indent2"><span class="nm">1.</span>This is difficult for Shmuel in this version.</p>
<p class="bas subject"><span class="nm">2)</span>DOES THE WIFE OF A DEAF <i>KOHEN</i> EAT <i>TERUMAH</i>?</p>
<p class="bas indent1"><span class="nm">(a)</span><span class="cl">(Beraisa):</span> If a Kohen was Mekadesh a Bas Yisrael and he became deaf before Nisu'in, she does not eat. If she bears a son, she eats;</p>
<p class="bas indent1"><span class="nm">(b)</span>R. Noson says, if the son dies, she eats;</p>
<p class="bas indent1"><span class="nm">(c)</span>Chachamim say, she does not eat.</p>
<p class="bas indent1"><span class="nm">(d)</span><span class="cl">Question:</span> What is R. Noson's reason?</p>
<p class="bas indent1"><span class="nm">(e)</span><span class="cl">Answer #1 (Rabah):</span> Since she already ate, she continues to eat.</p>
<p class="bas indent1"><span class="nm">(f)</span><span class="cl">Objection (Abaye):</span> According to this, if a Bas Yisrael was married to a Kohen and he died, she should continue to eat, since she once ate?!</p>
<p class="bas indent2"><span class="nm">1.</span>Rather, since he died, his Kedushah leaves her. Here also, when the son dies, his Kedushah leaves her!</p>
<p class="bas indent1"><span class="nm">(g)</span><span class="cl">Answer #2 (Rav Yosef):</span> R. Noson holds that Nisu'in when he was deaf permits her to eat Terumah (if he was healthy at the time of Kidushin). We do not decree lest she eat even if he was deaf at the time of Kidushin.</p>
<p class="bas indent1"><span class="nm">(h)</span><span class="cl">Question (Abaye):</span> If so, why did the Beraisa mention the birth of a son?</p>
<p class="bas indent1"><span class="nm">(i)</span><span class="cl">Answer:</span> This shows that Chachamim argue even in that case.</p>
<p class="bas indent1"><span class="nm">(j)</span><span class="cl">Question:</span> R. Noson should disagree with Chachamim in the Reisha!</p>
<p class="bas indent1"><span class="nm">(k)</span><span class="cl">Answer:</span> He waited until they finished saying their law, then argued with them.</p>
<p class="bas indent1"><span class="nm">(l)</span><span class="cl">Question:</span> If so, R. Noson's words should follow Chachamim's!</p>

<p class="bas indent1"><span class="nm">(b)</span><span class="cl">(Rav Amram citing Rav Sheshes):</span> If a Yisrael's wife was raped, even though she is permitted to her husband, she is disqualified to Kehunah.</p>
<p class="bas indent1"><span class="nm">(c)</span><span class="cl">Support (Mishnah):</span> Similarly, one who has Bi'ah with any Ervah (...disqualifies her. We do not distinguish between different kinds of Bi'ah.)</p>
<p class="bas indent2"><span class="nm">1.</span><span class="cl">Question:</span> Why does it say 'Similarly'?</p>
<p class="bas indent2"><span class="nm">2.</span><span class="cl">Answer #1:</span> We do not distinguish whether he was Shogeg or Mezid, willing or forced. In all cases, she is disqualified!</p>
<p class="bas indent1"><span class="nm">(d)</span><span class="cl">Rejection #1 (and Answer #2):</span> No, 'similarly' refers to Ha'ara'ah (it is considered like full Bi'ah).</p>
<p class="bas indent1"><span class="nm">(e)</span><span class="cl">Objection:</span> For which cases was this taught?</p>
<p class="bas indent2"><span class="nm">1.</span>It cannot refer to Arayos, for this would this connote that Ha'ara'ah of Arayos is learned from a Yevamah. However, the Torah taught about Ha'ara'ah of Arayos, and Yevamah is learned from Arayos!</p>
<p class="bas indent1"><span class="nm">(f)</span><span class="cl">Rejection #2 (and Answer #3):</span> Rather, similarly one is liable for Bi'ah Lo k'Darkah with Arayos.</p>

<p class="bas indent1"><span class="nm">(i)</span><span class="cl">Version #1 (Rabah):</span> If a Kohen's wife was raped, her husband is lashed for Bi'ah with her (after this), since she is a Zonah.</p>

<p class="bas indent1"><span class="nm">(k)</span><span class="cl">Answer:</span> Rather, he is lashed <i>even</i> for Zonah.</p>
<p class="bas indent1"><span class="nm">(l)</span><span class="cl">Question (R. Zeira - Beraisa):</span> If a married woman "was not grabbed" she is forbidden.

<p class="bas indent1"><span class="nm">(m)</span><span class="cl">Answer (Rabah):</span> The rule is, a married woman who was Mezaneh becomes a Zonah. The Torah revealed that if a Yisrael's wife "was not grabbed" she is forbidden, but if she was forced, she is permitted;</p>
<p class="bas indent2"><span class="nm">1.</span>Regarding a Kohen's wife, the rule remains (even if she was forced).</p>

<p class="bas indent1"><span class="nm">(a)</span><span class="cl">(Mishnah):</span> (We adopt Rashi's preferred explanation, DH Almanah.) A widow Mekudeshes to a Kohen Gadol or a divorcee or Chalutzah Mekudeshes to a regular Kohen may not eat Terumah (even if she is a Bas Kohen, for she is awaiting forbidden Bi'ah);</p>
<p class="bas indent1"><span class="nm">(b)</span>R. Elazar and R. Shimon permit (even if she is a Bas Yisrael, if the time for Nisu'in came but Nisu'in was not yet done, according to Mishnah Rishonah. They later decreed that she may not eat until Chupah.)</p>
<p class="bas indent1"><span class="nm">(c)</span>If they were widowed or divorced from Nisu'in, they are disqualified. If they were widowed or divorced from Kidushin, they are Kesheros.</p>
<p class="bas indent1"><span class="nm">(d)</span><span class="cl">(Gemara - Beraisa - R. Meir):</span> Kidushin of Heter (a Bas Yisrael to a Yisrael) does not permit a woman to eat Terumah. All the more so Kidushei Isur does not!</p>
<p class="bas indent1"><span class="nm">(e)</span><span class="cl">Chachamim:</span> No. Permitted Kidushin (to a Yisrael) never permits eating Terumah (even after Nisu'in). You cannot learn to Kidushei Isur (to a Kohen), which permits eating Terumah (when she is permitted to him)!</p>
<p class="bas indent1"><span class="nm">(f)</span><span class="cl">(R. Oshaya):</span> If a Kohen Petzu'a Daka (his private parts were crushed) was Mekadesh a Bas Yisrael, R. Meir argues with R. Elazar and R. Shimon about whether or not she may eat Terumah.</p>
<p class="bas indent2"><span class="nm">1.</span>R. Meir forbids a woman (Arusah) awaiting Bi'ah forbidden mid'Oraisa to eat Terumah. Here also, she may not eat;</p>
