<p class="bas subject"><span class="nm">1)</span>PARTNERS WHO VOWED FROM EACH OTHER (cont.)</p>
<p class="bas indent1"><span class="nm">(a)</span><span class="cl">(Continuation of Mishnah):</span> Both partners are forbidden to set up in the courtyard a mill or oven, or to raise chickens;</p>
<p class="bas indent1"><span class="nm">(b)</span>If only Reuven was Mudar Hana'ah from his partner, he may not enter the courtyard;</p>
<p class="bas indent1"><span class="nm">(c)</span>R. Eliezer ben Yakov permits him, for he can say that he enters his portion;</p>
<p class="bas indent2"><span class="nm">1.</span>We force the Noder (the one who vowed) to sell his portion.</p>
<p class="bas indent1"><span class="nm">(d)</span>If someone else (not a partner) was Mudar Hana'ah from one of the partners, he may not enter the courtyard;</p>
<p class="bas indent1"><span class="nm">(e)</span>R. Eliezer ben Yakov permits, for he can say that he enters the other partner's portion.</p>
<p class="bas indent1"><span class="nm">(f)</span>If Reuven is Mudar Hana'ah from Shimon, and Shimon has a bathhouse or olive press rented out:</p>
<p class="bas indent2"><span class="nm">1.</span>If Shimon still has control of it, Reuven may not use it. If Shimon does not control it, Reuven may use it.</p>
<p class="bas indent1"><span class="nm">(g)</span>If Reuven said to Shimon 'it is forbidden for me to enter your house or buy your field', if Shimon died or sold them, Reuven is permitted;</p>
<p class="bas indent1"><span class="nm">(h)</span>If Reuven said 'it is forbidden for me to enter this house or buy this field', and the owner died or sold them, Reuven is forbidden.</p>
<p class="bas subject"><span class="nm">2)</span>IN WHICH CASE DO THEY ARGUE?</p>
<p class="bas indent1"><span class="nm">(a)</span><span class="cl">(Gemara) Question:</span> Chachamim and R. Eliezer ben Yakov (surely) argue when each partner vowed not to benefit from the other. Do they argue when each vowed that the other should not benefit from him?</p>
<p class="bas indent2"><span class="nm">1.</span>Perhaps Chachamim agree that in such a case, they are permitted, for they are Ones (each was forbidden against his will);</p>
<p class="bas indent2"><span class="nm">2.</span>Or, perhaps they argue even when each forbade the other!</p>
<p class="bas indent1"><span class="nm">(b)</span><span class="cl">Answer #1 (Mishnah):</span> If only Reuven was Mudar (i.e. Shimon forbade him, he is forbidden).</p>
<p class="bas indent1"><span class="nm">(c)</span><span class="cl">Rejection (and Answer #2):</span> It should say (Tosfos; Ran - 'Mudar' can also mean) that Reuven was Noder (forbade himself).</p>
<p class="bas indent1"><span class="nm">(d)</span><span class="cl">Support (for Answer #2 - Mishnah):</span> We force the Noder to sell his portion.</p>
<p class="bas indent2"><span class="nm">1.</span>Granted, if Reuven himself vowed, we force him to sell his portion. But if Shimon forbade Reuven to get benefit, why should we force Reuven to sell? He is blameless!</p>
<p class="bas bbbline">46b----------------------------------------46b</p>
<p class="bas indent1"><span class="nm">(e)</span><span class="cl">Opinion #1 (Rabah):</span> They argue only when the courtyard has Din Chalukah (either of them can force the other to divide it, for each will receive a proper size courtyard). If not, all agree that they are permitted.</p>
<p class="bas indent1"><span class="nm">(f)</span><span class="cl">Question (Rav Yosef):</span> A Beis ha'Keneses does not have Din Chalukah, yet they are forbidden!</p>
<p class="bas indent2"><span class="nm">1.</span><span class="cl">(Mishnah):</span> They are forbidden in property of the city!</p>
<p class="bas indent1"><span class="nm">(g)</span><span class="cl">Opinion #2 (Rav Yosef):</span> They argue only when the does not have Din Chalukah. If it has Din Chalukah, all agree that they are forbidden.</p>
<p class="bas indent1"><span class="nm">(h)</span><span class="cl">(Rav Huna and R. Elazar):</span> The Halachah follows R. Eliezer ben Yakov.</p>
<p class="bas subject"><span class="nm">3)</span>WHAT IS CONSIDERED CONTROL OF A BATHHOUSE?</p>
<p class="bas indent1"><span class="nm">(a)</span><span class="cl">(Mishnah):</span> If Reuven is Mudar Hana'ah from Shimon, and Shimon has a bathhouse...</p>
<p class="bas indent1"><span class="nm">(b)</span><span class="cl">Question:</span> What is considered having control of it?</p>
<p class="bas indent1"><span class="nm">(c)</span><span class="cl">Answer #1 (Rav Nachman):</span> Shimon receives a half, a third, or a quarter of the profits, but not less than this (Ran's text - but not (the right to sell to bathers) eggs.)</p>
<p class="bas indent1"><span class="nm">(d)</span><span class="cl">Answer #2 (Abaye):</span> It is even if Shimon receives less.</p>
<p class="bas indent1"><span class="nm">(e)</span><span class="cl">Question:</span> According to Abaye, in which case is Reuven permitted?</p>
<p class="bas indent1"><span class="nm">(f)</span><span class="cl">Answer:</span> He is permitted when Shimon receives a fixed rental.</p>
