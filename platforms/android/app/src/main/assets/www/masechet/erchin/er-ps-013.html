<p class="dedicationbox">ERCHIN 13 - Two weeks of study material have been dedicated by Mrs. Estanne Abraham Fawer to honor the twelfth Yahrzeit of her father, Rav Mordechai ben Eliezer Zvi (Rabbi Morton Weiner) Z'L, who passed away on 18 Teves 5760. May the merit of supporting and advancing Dafyomi study -- which was so important to him -- during the weeks of his Yahrzeit serve as an Iluy for his Neshamah. </p>

<div class="subject"><span class="nm">1)</span><p>THE CHURBANOS WERE IN MOTZA'EI SHEMITAH (cont).</p></div>
<div class="indent1"><span class="nm">(a)</span><p>(We asked that the last (full) year of Bayis Sheni was year six of Shemitah, so the Churban was in Shemitah, and not Motza'ei Shemitah.)</p></div>
<div class="indent1"><span class="nm">(b)</span><p><span class="cl">Answer #3 (Rav Ashi):</span> Bnei Yisrael did not start to count the Yovel cycle until Ezra came from Bavel in the sixth year of Bayis Sheni;</p></div>
<div class="indent2"><span class="nm">1.</span><p>"Betelas Avidas Beis Elaka... Ad Shenas Tartein l'Malchus Daryavesh" (construction of Bayis Sheni was stopped. It did not resume until the second year of Daryavesh. This begins the 420 years of Bayis Sheni);</p></div>
<div class="indent2"><span class="nm">2.</span><p>"V'Sheitzi Baysah Denah... Shenas Shes l'Malchus Daryavesh" (it was finished in the sixth year);</p></div>
<div class="indent2"><span class="nm">3.</span><p>"Va'Yavo Yerushalayim... Shenas ha'Shevi'is la'Melech." (Ezra came in the seventh year, i.e. the sixth year of Bayis Sheni.)</p></div>
<div class="indent1"><span class="nm">(c)</span><p><span class="cl">(Beraisa):</span> Yisrael counted 17 Yovelos from entering Eretz Yisrael until the first Churban;</p></div>
<div class="indent2"><span class="nm">1.</span><p>We cannot say that they began counting Yovel immediately, for if so the Churban would have been in the first year of Yovel. Really Yovel was "b'Arba Esreh Shanah Achar Asher Huksah ha'Ir"!</p></div>
<div class="indent1"><span class="nm">(d)</span><p><span class="cl">Question:</span> (We said that the count began after seven years of conquest and seven of division.) What is the source that there were seven years of conquest?</p></div>
<div class="indent1"><span class="nm">(e)</span><p><span class="cl">Answer:</span> Verses teach that when the Meraglim toured Eretz Yisrael, Kalev was 40 years old. He was 85 when the conquest was finished;</p></div>
<div class="indent2"><span class="nm">1.</span><p>(Everything for) the Mishkan was built in the first year in the Midbar. In the second year it was erected and the Meraglim were sent;</p></div>
<div class="indent2"><span class="nm">2.</span><p>It follows that Kalev was 78 when he entered Eretz Yisrael (after 40 years in the Midbar).</p></div>
<div class="indent1"><span class="nm">(f)</span><p><span class="cl">Question:</span> What is the source that the division took seven years?</p></div>
<div class="indent1"><span class="nm">(g)</span><p><span class="cl">Answer #1:</span> Since the conquest took seven years, also the division was seven years. (The Gemara does not explain the logic. Perhaps Hash-m caused that both should take the same amount of time, to show that the duration of the conquest was due to Hashgachah ("Pen Tihyeh ha'Aretz Shemamah v'Rabah Alecha Chayas ha'Sadeh"), and not due to the strength of the Kena'anim. <i>Seven</i> years makes this even more evident, since this is the most common number in the Torah concerning units of time. Ben Yehoyada explains (based on the Arizal) that the years of conquest are a Tikun for Rachel, and the years of division are a Tikun for Leah. These must be equal, just like Yakov worked seven years for each, and other parallels brought there.)</p></div>
<div class="indent1"><span class="nm">(h)</span><p><span class="cl">Answer #2:</span> We must say that the division took seven years in order to explain how Yovel was 14 years after the Churban.</p></div>
<div class="subject"><span class="nm">2)</span><p>THE NUMBER OF PREPARED LAMBS</p></div>
<div class="indent1"><span class="nm">(a)</span><p><span class="cl">(Mishnah):</span> We never have less than six checked lambs in the chamber of lambs, the amount needed for Shabbos and two days of Rosh Hashanah. (Sometimes these are three consecutive days);</p></div>
<div class="indent2"><span class="nm">1.</span><p>There is no upper limit to the number we may have there.</p></div>
<div class="indent1"><span class="nm">(b)</span><p>We never have less than two trumpets and nine harps (to accompany Shirah). There is no upper limit;</p></div>
<div class="indent2"><span class="nm">1.</span><p>There is only one (pair of) Metziltayim (cymbals. Tosfos Yom Tov - some say that this was a wind instrument).</p></div>
<div class="indent1"><span class="nm">(c)</span><p><span class="cl">(Gemara) Question:</span> We need more than six checked lambs for the Temidim and Musafim of Shabbos and Rosh Hashanah!</p></div>
<div class="indent1"><span class="nm">(d)</span><p><span class="cl">Answer:</span> Indeed, the Tana counts only Temidim. He teaches that we must always have six checked lambs;</p></div>
<div class="indent2"><span class="nm">1.</span><p>"For Shabbos and Rosh Hashanah" is merely a way to remember (that we require enough for three days. This happens to equal the most consecutive days that one may not check);</p></div>
<div class="indent2"><span class="nm">2.</span><p>The Mishnah teaches that there are never less than six lambs that have been checked four days before Shechitah. It is like Ben Bag Bag:</p></div>
<div class="bbbline">13b----------------------------------------13b</p></div>
<div class="indent3"><span class="nm">i.</span><p><span class="cl">(Beraisa - Ben Bag Bag) Question:</span> What is the source that the Tamid must be checked four days before it is slaughtered?</p></div>
<div class="indent3"><span class="nm">ii.</span><p><span class="cl">Answer:</span> We learn from a Gezeirah Shavah. It says (regarding the Tamid) "<i>Tishmeru</i> Lehakriv Li b'Mo'ado," and it says "v'Hayah Lachem <i>l'Mishmeres</i> Ad Arba'ah Asar." Just like Pesach must be checked four days in advance, also the Tamid.</p></div>
<div class="indent1"><span class="nm">(e)</span><p><span class="cl">Support:</span> It says "<i>the amount needed</i> for Shabbos and two days of Rosh Hashanah." It does not say "<i>for</i> Shabbos... "</p></div>
<div class="subject"><span class="nm">3)</span><p>THE NUMBER OF INSTRUMENTS</p></div>
<div class="indent1"><span class="nm">(a)</span><p>(Mishnah):... (At least) two trumpets... there is no upper limit.</p></div>
<div class="indent1"><span class="nm">(b)</span><p><span class="cl">Question:</span> What is the maximum allowed? (The Gemara knew that there really is an upper limit of trumpets (Tiferes Yisrael - too many would drown out the other instruments). In the other clauses (that say this), there really is no upper limit.)</p></div>
<div class="indent1"><span class="nm">(c)</span><p><span class="cl">Answer (Rav Huna):</span> Up to 120 are allowed. We learn from "v'Imahem Kohanim Ad l'Me'ah v'Esrim Machtzerim ba'Chatzotzeros."</p></div>
<div class="indent1"><span class="nm">(d)</span><p><span class="cl">(Mishnah):</span> There is only one (pair of) cymbals.</p></div>
<div class="indent1"><span class="nm">(e)</span><p><span class="cl">Question:</span> What is the source of this?</p></div>
<div class="indent1"><span class="nm">(f)</span><p><span class="cl">Answer (Rav Asi):</span> "V'Asaf ba'Metziltayim."</p></div>
<div class="indent1"><span class="nm">(g)</span><p><span class="cl">Question:</span> "Metziltayim" is plural. We should say that there are two!</p></div>
<div class="indent1"><span class="nm">(h)</span><p><span class="cl">Answer:</span> Since both cymbals are used by one person to make one sound, they are counted like one.</p></div>
<div class="indent1"><span class="nm">(i)</span><p><span class="cl">(Mishnah):</span> We never have less than 12 Leviyim standing on the Duchan. There is no upper limit;</p></div>
<div class="indent1"><span class="nm">(j)</span><p>The only time a minor may enter the Azarah for Avodah is when the Leviyim sing;</p></div>
<div class="indent2"><span class="nm">1.</span><p>Minors may not play harps or lyres. They only sing, to enable a blend of different voices (their voices are higher).</p></div>
<div class="indent1"><span class="nm">(k)</span><p>R. Eliezer ben Yakov says, they do not count towards the 12 required Leviyim. They do not stand on the Duchan, rather, on the ground. Their heads are between the legs of the Leviyim on the Duchan; they were called Tze'irei (those who pain) ha'Leviyim.</p></div>
<div class="indent1"><span class="nm">(l)</span><p><span class="cl">(Gemara) Question:</span> Why is 12 the minimum number of Leviyim?</p></div>
<div class="indent1"><span class="nm">(m)</span><p><span class="cl">Answer (Rav Papa):</span> This is because we need at least nine harps, two lyres and one pair of cymbals - "Hu v'Echav u'Vanav Sheneim Asar."</p></div>
<div class="subject"><span class="nm">4)</span><p>MINORS MAY SING</p></div>
<div class="indent1"><span class="nm">(a)</span><p><span class="cl">(Mishnah):</span> The only time a minor may enter the Azarah for Avodah is when the Leviyim sing;</p></div>
<div class="indent1"><span class="nm">(b)</span><p><span class="cl">Question:</span> What is the source of this?</p></div>
<div class="indent1"><span class="nm">(c)</span><p><span class="cl">Answer (R. Yochanan):</span> "Va'Ya'amod Yeshu'a Banav v'Echav Kadmi'el u'Vanav Bnei Yehudah k'Echad l'Natze'ach." ("Banav" is extra. It alludes to minors.)</p></div>
<div class="indent1"><span class="nm">(d)</span><p><span class="cl">(Mishnah):</span> Minors may not play a Nevel or Kinor (lyre or harp). They may only sing.</p></div>
<div class="indent1"><span class="nm">(e)</span><p><span class="cl">Inference:</span> Nevel and Kinor are different.</p></div>
<div class="indent1"><span class="nm">(f)</span><p><span class="cl">Suggestion:</span> Our Mishnah is unlike R. Yehudah;</p></div>
<div class="indent2"><span class="nm">1.</span><p><span class="cl">(Beraisa - R. Yehudah):</span> The Kinor in the Mikdash had seven strings. We read "<i>Sova</i> Semachos Es Panecha" as if it said "Sheva";</p></div>
<div class="indent2"><span class="nm">2.</span><p>In Yemos ha'Mashi'ach it will have eight strings. "La'Menatze'ach Al <i>ha'Sheminis</i>" refers to a harp of eight strings;</p></div>
<div class="indent2"><span class="nm">3.</span><p>In the world to come it will have 10 strings - "Alei Asor va'Alei Navel Alei Higayon b'Chinor," "Hodu la'Shem b'Chinor b'Nevel Asor... Shir Chodosh."</p></div>
<div class="indent1"><span class="nm">(g)</span><p><span class="cl">Rejection:</span> It is even like R. Yehudah. He agrees that they are different;</p></div>
<div class="indent2"><span class="nm">1.</span><p>Kinor is called Nevel in the world to come, for it will have many strings and make many notes like a Nevel.</p></div>
<div class="indent1"><span class="nm">(h)</span><p><span class="cl">(Mishnah - R. Eliezer ben Yakov):</span> They do not count towards the 12 required Leviyim...</p></div>
<div class="indent1"><span class="nm">(i)</span><p><span class="cl">(Beraisa):</span> They were called So'adei (those who help) ha'Leviyim.</p></div>
<div class="indent1"><span class="nm">(j)</span><p>Our Tana calls them Tze'irei ha'Leviyim. Since their voices are so fine, they pain adult Leviyim who cannot sing so nicely.</p></div>

<div class="subject"><span class="nm">5)</span><p>LENIENCIES AND STRINGENCIES</p></div>
<div class="indent1"><span class="nm">(a)</span><p><span class="cl">(Mishnah):</span> Each of the following has leniencies and stringencies:</p></div>
<div class="indent2"><span class="nm">1.</span><p>Erchin, Sedeh Achuzah, Shor ha'Mu'ad that killed a slave, Ones or Mefateh (one who raped or seduced an unmarried virgin Na'arah), and Motzi Shem Ra.</p></div>
<div class="indent1"><span class="nm">(b)</span><p>Erchin has leniencies and stringencies. If one was Ma'arich the nicest (most valuable) Yisrael, or the worst, he pays 50 Shekalim;</p></div>
<div class="indent2"><span class="nm">1.</span><p>Had he vowed his Damim, he would pay his value.</p></div>
<div class="indent1"><span class="nm">(c)</span><p><span class="cl">(Gemara) Observation:</span> The Mishnah discusses one who was Ma'arich the nicest or worst <i>Yisrael</i>, but not a Nochri.</p></div>
<div class="indent1"><span class="nm">(d)</span><p><span class="cl">Suggestion:</span> The Mishnah is unlike R. Meir, who says that a Nochri can be Ne'erach, but cannot be Ma'arich.</p></div>
