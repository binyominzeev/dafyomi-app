<p class="bas subject"><span class="nm">1)</span>WHAT WE DO WITH THE MONEY</p>
<p class="bas indent1"><span class="nm">(a)</span><span class="cl">(Mishnah):</span> If money was designated for the Korbanos Stam, it goes to Nedavah.</p>
<p class="bas indent1"><span class="nm">(b)</span><span class="cl">Question:</span> Money for the Chatas is mixed in (and it must go waste. How can we use all the money for Olos?)!</p>
<p class="bas indent1"><span class="nm">(c)</span><span class="cl">Answer #1 (R. Yochanan):</span> This law is a tradition from Sinai regarding a Nazir.</p>
<p class="bas indent1"><span class="nm">(d)</span><span class="cl">Answer #2 (Reish Lakish):</span> "For all their Nedarim (commitments to bring a Korban) and Nedavos (animals declared to be Korbanos)" teaches that excess Nedarim are Nedavah.</p>
<p class="bas indent1"><span class="nm">(e)</span><span class="cl">Question:</span> We understand R. Yochanan. He holds that the tradition applies only to Stam money.</p>
<p class="bas indent2"><span class="nm">1.</span>According to Reish Lakish, the verse should apply even to specified money!</p>
<p class="bas indent1"><span class="nm">(f)</span><span class="cl">Answer (Rava):</span> We learn from Tana d'Vei R. Yishmael that it does not apply to specified money:</p>
<p class="bas indent2"><span class="nm">1.</span><span class="cl">(Beraisa - Tana d'Vei R. Yishmael):</span> "Only your Korbanos that will be to you and your Nedarim" discusses Vlados (the offspring of) Korbanos, and Temurah (an animal onto which one tried to transfer the Kedushah of a Korban);</p>
<p class="bas indent2"><span class="nm">2.</span>The Torah commands "you will bring them to the Mikdash."</p>
<p class="bas indent2"><span class="nm">3.</span><span class="cl">Suggestion:</span> Perhaps we bring them to the Mikdash, and deny them food and water, so they will die!</p>
<p class="bas indent2"><span class="nm">4.</span><span class="cl">Rejection:</span> "You will offer your Olos, the meat and the blood" teaches that the Temurah of an Olah is (offered) like an Olah, and Vlad Shelamim is like a Shelamim.</p>
<p class="bas indent2"><span class="nm">5.</span><span class="cl">Suggestion:</span> Perhaps also Vlad Chatas and Temuras Asham are like a Chatas and Asham, respectively!</p>
<p class="bas indent2"><span class="nm">6.</span><span class="cl">Rejection #1 (R. Yishmael):</span> "Only (Olos and Shelamim" teaches that this does not apply to other Korbanos).</p>
<p class="bas indent2"><span class="nm">7.</span><span class="cl">Rejection #2 (R. Akiva):</span> You need not expound "only". "Asham Hu (it is an Asham)" teaches that we offer the Asham itself (and not its Temurah).</p>
<p class="bas subject"><span class="nm">2)</span><i>ASHAMOS</i> THAT CANNOT BE OFFERED</p>
<p class="bas indent1"><span class="nm">(a)</span><span class="cl">(Beraisa):</span> One might have thought that we bring them to the Mikdash, and deny them food and water, so they will die. "You will offer your Olos" teaches that we do not.</p>
<p class="bas indent1"><span class="nm">(b)</span><span class="cl">Question:</span> Why would one think they must die? The tradition from Sinai applies only to Chata'os!</p>
<p class="bas indent1"><span class="nm">(c)</span><span class="cl">Answer:</span> If not for the verse, one might have thought that Vlad Chatas can die where it is, but Vlados of other Korbanos must be brought to the Mikdash to die.</p>
<p class="bas bbbline">25b----------------------------------------25b</p>
<p class="bas indent2"><span class="nm">1.</span>The verse teaches that this is not so.</p>
<p class="bas indent1"><span class="nm">(d)</span><span class="cl">(Beraisa):</span> One might have thought that Vlad Chatas and Temuras Asham are like a Chatas and Asham. "Only (Olos and Shelamim)" teaches that they are not.</p>
<p class="bas indent1"><span class="nm">(e)</span><span class="cl">Question:</span> Why is a verse needed? A tradition from Sinai teaches that Vlad Chatas must die!</p>
<p class="bas indent1"><span class="nm">(f)</span><span class="cl">Answer:</span> Indeed, the verse is needed only to teach about Temuras Asham.</p>
<p class="bas indent1"><span class="nm">(g)</span><span class="cl">Question:</span> (The verse is not needed!) There is also a tradition from Sinai about Ashamos: in any case in which a Chatas must die, an Asham grazes (until it gets a Mum. Then it is redeemed, and the money is used for Nedavah!)</p>
<p class="bas indent1"><span class="nm">(h)</span><span class="cl">Answer:</span> If we had only the tradition, one might have thought that one may not offer it, but one who offered it is exempt;</p>
<p class="bas indent2"><span class="nm">1.</span>The verse teaches that one who offers it transgresses an Aseh.</p>
<p class="bas indent1"><span class="nm">(i)</span><span class="cl">(Beraisa - R. Akiva):</span> You need not expound "Only". "Asham Hu" teaches that we offer the Asham itself (but not its Temurah)</p>
<p class="bas indent1"><span class="nm">(j)</span><span class="cl">Question:</span> The verse is not needed! A tradition teaches that in any case in which a Chatas must die (e.g. a Temurah), an Asham grazes!</p>
<p class="bas indent1"><span class="nm">(k)</span><span class="cl">Answer:</span> Indeed, the verse ("Asham Hu") is not needed to teach that it grazes. Rather, it teaches Rav's law:</p>
<p class="bas indent2"><span class="nm">1.</span><span class="cl">(Rav):</span> If an Asham was Nitak (given to a shepherd to graze) and was slaughtered for an Olah, it is Kosher.</p>
<p class="bas indent2"><span class="nm">2.</span>If it was not Nitak, it is Pasul. "Hu" teaches that it remains an Asham (until Nituk).</p>
