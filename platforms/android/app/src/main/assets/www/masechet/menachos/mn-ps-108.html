<div class="indent1"><span class="nm">(a)</span><p>The others did not answer like Chizkiyah. They hold that we are not concerned for fighting;</p></div>
<div class="indent1"><span class="nm">(b)</span><p>The others did not answer like R. Yochanan. They hold that we are not concerned for rotting;</p></div>
<div class="indent1"><span class="nm">(c)</span><p>They did not answer like Ze'iri. They did not want to establish the Mishnah like an individual;</p></div>
<div class="indent1"><span class="nm">(d)</span><p>They did not answer like Bar Pada. It is unreasonable to have a separate box for Mosar, since all of these are Mosar;</p></div>
<div class="indent2"><span class="nm">1.</span><p>Also, it is unreasonable to have a separate box for Kalbonos, since they are given with the (half) Shekalim. (The others holds like R. Meir in the coming Beraisa.)</p></div>
<div class="indent2"><span class="nm">2.</span><p><span class="cl">(Beraisa - R. Meir):</span> The Kalbonos are put with the (half) Shekalim;</p></div>
<div class="indent2"><span class="nm">3.</span><p>R. Eliezer says, they go for Nedavah.</p></div>
<div class="indent1"><span class="nm">(e)</span><p><span class="cl">Answer #5 (Shmuel):</span> They correspond to six Mosaros, of Chatas, Asham, Asham Nazir, Asham Metzora, Minchas Chotei and Chavitei Kohen Gadol.</p></div>
<div class="indent1"><span class="nm">(f)</span><p><span class="cl">Answer #6 (R. Oshaya):</span> They correspond to Mosar of Chatas, Asham, Asham Nazir, Asham Metzora, Kinim and Minchas Chotei.</p></div>
<div class="indent1"><span class="nm">(g)</span><p>Shmuel (and the other Amora'im) did not answer like R. Oshaya, for the Reisha already lists Kinim (among seven other boxes.)</p></div>
<div class="indent1"><span class="nm">(h)</span><p><span class="cl">Question:</span> Did R. Oshaya's text of the Reisha exclude Kinim?!</p></div>
<div class="indent2"><span class="nm">1.</span><p>You cannot say so. He taught Kinim in the Reisha!</p></div>
<div class="indent1"><span class="nm">(i)</span><p><span class="cl">Answer:</span> The Reisha teaches Kinim, and the Seifa teaches Mosar Kinim.</p></div>
<div class="indent1"><span class="nm">(j)</span><p>R. Oshaya did not answer like Shmuel because he holds like the opinion that Mosar Chavitim must rot:</p></div>
<div class="indent2"><span class="nm">1.</span><p><span class="cl">(Beraisa):</span> Mosar Minchas Nedavah, Mosar Minchah must rot (this will be explained).</p></div>
<div class="indent2"><span class="nm">2.</span><p><span class="cl">Question:</span> What does this mean?</p></div>
<div class="indent2"><span class="nm">3.</span><p><span class="cl">Answer #1 (Rav Chisda):</span> It means that Mosar Minchas Chotei goes to Nedavah (like Mosar Chatas), but Mosar Chavitim must rot.</p></div>
<div class="indent2"><span class="nm">4.</span><p><span class="cl">Objection (Rabah):</span> Also Mosar Chavitim also goes to Nedavah!</p></div>
<div class="indent2"><span class="nm">5.</span><p><span class="cl">Answer #2 (Rabah):</span> Rather, Mosar Minchah refers to Mosar Lachmei Todah. It must rot.</p></div>
<div class="indent1"><span class="nm">(k)</span><p>Also other Amora'im also argue about this;</p></div>
<div class="indent2"><span class="nm">1.</span><p><span class="cl">(R. Yochanan):</span> Mosar Chavitim goes to Nedavah;</p></div>
<div class="indent2"><span class="nm">2.</span><p><span class="cl">(R. Elazar):</span> It must rot.</p></div>
<div class="indent1"><span class="nm">(l)</span><p><span class="cl">Question (Mishnah):</span> Extra (money that people designated for their half-) Shekalim are (is) Chulin. Mosar Asiris ha'Eifah, Mosar Kinim of a Zav, Zavah, or Yoledes, Mosar Chatas and Asham are Nedavah.</p></div>
<div class="indent2"><span class="nm">1.</span><p><span class="cl">Suggestion:</span> Asiris ha'Eifah refers to Chavitim (which are an Isaron)!</p></div>
<div class="indent1"><span class="nm">(m)</span><p><span class="cl">Answer:</span> No, it refers to Minchas Chotei.</p></div>
<div class="indent1"><span class="nm">(n)</span><p><span class="cl">Support (for Rav Chisda - Rav Nachman bar Yitzchak - Beraisa):</span> "Lo Yasim Aleha Shemen v'Lo Yiten Aleha Levonah Ki Chatas Hi";</p></div>
<div class="indent2"><span class="nm">1.</span><p><span class="cl">(Rav Yehudah):</span> Only Minchas Chotei is called Chatas. This teaches that Mosar Chavitim is not called Chatas. Therefore it requires Levonah, and its Mosar must rot.</p></div>
<div class="subject"><span class="nm">2)</span><p>THE REPLACEMENT FOR A BLEMISHED KORBAN</p></div>
<div class="indent1"><span class="nm">(a)</span><p><span class="cl">(Mishnah):</span> If Reuven said 'this bull is an Olah' and it became blemished, if he wants he may buy two bulls (to be Olos) with its (redemption) money;</p></div>
<div class="indent2"><span class="nm">1.</span><p>If he said 'these two bulls are Olos' and they became blemished, he may buy one bull (with the money);</p></div>
<div class="indent2"><span class="nm">2.</span><p>Rebbi forbids this.</p></div>
<div class="indent1"><span class="nm">(b)</span><p>If he said 'this ram is an Olah' and it became blemished, he may buy a lamb;</p></div>
<div class="indent2"><span class="nm">1.</span><p>If he said 'this lamb is an Olah' and it became blemished, he may buy a ram;</p></div>
<div class="indent2"><span class="nm">2.</span><p>Rebbi forbids this.</p></div>
<div class="bbbline">108b----------------------------------------108b</p></div>
<div class="indent1"><span class="nm">(c)</span><p><span class="cl">(Gemara) Contradiction (the previous Mishnah):</span> If one vowed to bring a bull for a Maneh and he brought two bulls for a Maneh, he was not Yotzei.</p></div>
<div class="indent1"><span class="nm">(d)</span><p><span class="cl">Answer:</span> Here is different. (He is Yotzei, for there two reasons why he is less obligated to replace the Korban.) He said 'this' (a Nedavah without Acharayus, not a vow), and it got a Mum.</p></div>
<div class="indent1"><span class="nm">(e)</span><p><span class="cl">(Mishnah):</span> If he said 'These two bulls are Olos' and they became blemished, he may buy one bull; Rebbi forbids this.</p></div>
<div class="indent1"><span class="nm">(f)</span><p><span class="cl">Question:</span> Why does Rebbi forbid?</p></div>
<div class="indent1"><span class="nm">(g)</span><p><span class="cl">Answer:</span> (Because it is better to bring two animals than one animal of their combined value,) this is like bringing a small (inferior) animal in place of a big one;</p></div>
<div class="indent2"><span class="nm">1.</span><p>Even though it got a Mum, Rebbi forbids.</p></div>
<div class="indent1"><span class="nm">(h)</span><p><span class="cl">Question:</span> (Rebbi forbids bringing a big animal in place of a small one.) He should also forbid in the Reisha (bringing two bulls in place of one!)</p></div>
<div class="indent1"><span class="nm">(i)</span><p><span class="cl">Answer:</span> Indeed, this is true! He waited until Chachamim finished their teaching, then he argued with both laws.</p></div>
<div class="indent1"><span class="nm">(j)</span><p><span class="cl">Support (Seifa):</span> If he said 'this ram is an Olah' and it became blemished, he may buy a lamb;</p></div>
<div class="indent2"><span class="nm">1.</span><p>If he said 'this lamb is an Olah' and it became blemished, he may buy a ram;</p></div>
<div class="indent2"><span class="nm">2.</span><p>Rebbi forbids this (even though a ram is bigger and better than a lamb)!</p></div>
<div class="indent1"><span class="nm">(k)</span><p><span class="cl">Question:</span> May one buy a different species than the original Korban?</p></div>
<div class="indent1"><span class="nm">(l)</span><p><span class="cl">Answer (Beraisa):</span> If one said 'this bull is an Olah' and it became blemished, he may not buy a ram with its money (for it is smaller and inferior), but he may buy two rams;</p></div>
<div class="indent2"><span class="nm">1.</span><p>Rebbi forbids because Ein Bilah (the Menachos for the two rams may not be combined in one Kli. It is unlike his initial Korban, which required only one Minchah.)</p></div>
<div class="indent2"><span class="nm">2.</span><p>(All agree that one may buy a different species as long as it is not inferior and its Minchah requires the same number of Kelim, e.g. a bull in place of a ram. This answers the question.)</p></div>
<div class="indent1"><span class="nm">(m)</span><p><span class="cl">Question:</span> If so, Chachamim should permit buying even one ram, for (in the Mishnah) they permit buying a smaller replacement (e.g. a lamb in place of a ram)!</p></div>
<div class="indent1"><span class="nm">(n)</span><p><span class="cl">Answer:</span> Tana'im argue about the opinion of Chachamim. (The Tana of the Beraisa holds that they forbid buying a smaller replacement.)</p></div>
<div class="indent1"><span class="nm">(o)</span><p><span class="cl">(Beraisa - Rebbi):</span> It is forbidden because Ein Bilah.</p></div>
<div class="indent1"><span class="nm">(p)</span><p><span class="cl">Inference:</span> If not for Ein Bilah, it would be permitted.</p></div>
<div class="indent1"><span class="nm">(q)</span><p><span class="cl">Question (Mishnah):</span> If he said 'this ram is an Olah' and it became blemished, he may buy a lamb. If he said 'this lamb is an Olah'...he may buy a ram;</p></div>
<div class="indent2"><span class="nm">1.</span><p>Rebbi forbids this.</p></div>
<div class="indent2"><span class="nm">2.</span><p>Even though Bilah is not a problem (in any case one Minchah is brought), Rebbi requires bringing a replacement just like the blemished animal!</p></div>
<div class="indent1"><span class="nm">(r)</span><p><span class="cl">Answer:</span> Tana'im argue about the opinion of Rebbi. (The Tana of the Beraisa says that he permits as long as the replacement is not inferior, and its Minchah requires the same number of Kelim.)</p></div>
<div class="subject"><span class="nm">3)</span><p>THE REPLACEMENT FOR A KORBAN</p></div>
<div class="indent1"><span class="nm">(a)</span><p><span class="cl">(Continuation of Beraisa):</span> If there is no blemish, if he brought a bull in place of a calf, or a ram in place of a lamb, he was Yotzei. (We discuss a vow to bring an animal. If he was Makdish an animal, he cannot change it without a Mum!)</p></div>
<div class="indent1"><span class="nm">(b)</span><p>This is like Chachamim (107b, who permit a better replacement).</p></div>
<div class="indent1"><span class="nm">(c)</span><p>(Mishnah):...If he wants he may buy with its money...</p></div>
<div class="indent1"><span class="nm">(d)</span><p><span class="cl">Version #1 (Rav Menasiya bar Zevid):</span> This is only if he said 'this bull is an Olah', but if he said 'this bull is Alai an Olah', it is fixed. (He must bring one animal.)</p></div>
<div class="indent1"><span class="nm">(e)</span><p><span class="cl">Objection:</span> Perhaps he means 'it is incumbent on me to bring it for an Olah'! (Once it became blemished, he cannot fulfill his vow; it is Batel.)</p></div>
<div class="indent1"><span class="nm">(f)</span><p><span class="cl">Correction:</span> Surely, he must have taught the following:</p></div>
<div class="indent1"><span class="nm">(g)</span><p><span class="cl">Version #2 (Rav Menasiya bar Zevid):</span> This is only if he said 'this bull is an Olah', or 'this bull is Alai an Olah', but if he said 'this bull and its money are Alai an Olah', it is fixed.</p></div>
<div class="subject"><span class="nm">4)</span><p>AN UNSPECIFIED KORBAN</p></div>
<div class="indent1"><span class="nm">(a)</span><p><span class="cl">(Mishnah):</span> If Reuven said 'one of my lambs (or bulls) is a Korban':</p></div>
<div class="indent2"><span class="nm">1.</span><p>If he has two, the larger one is a Korban;</p></div>
<div class="indent2"><span class="nm">2.</span><p>If he has three, the medium one is a Korban. (This will be explained.)</p></div>
<div class="indent1"><span class="nm">(b)</span><p>If he specified which will be the Korban and does not remember which, or if his father told him that he specified a Korban but did not tell him which, the biggest is a Korban.</p></div>
<div class="indent1"><span class="nm">(c)</span><p><span class="cl">(Gemara) Inference:</span> (The Reisha teaches that) people are Makdish b'Ayin Yafah (generously).</p></div>
<div class="indent1"><span class="nm">(d)</span><p><span class="cl">Contradiction (Seifa):</span> If he has three, the medium one is a Korban. This shows that people are Makdish b'Ayin Ra'ah (stingily)!</p></div>
<div class="indent1"><span class="nm">(e)</span><p><span class="cl">Resolution (Shmuel):</span> The Seifa means that we are concerned even for the medium one. With respect to the smallest, it is Ayin Yafah. (However, we offer only one of them.)</p></div>
<div class="indent1"><span class="nm">(f)</span><p><span class="cl">Question:</span> (Since each is Safek Hekdesh,) how do we offer only one?</p></div>
<div class="indent1"><span class="nm">(g)</span><p><span class="cl">Answer (R. Chiya bar Rav):</span> We wait for the medium to get a Mum, it is then redeemed onto the biggest. (If the biggest was truly the Korban, this 'redemption' does nothing.)</p></div>
<div class="indent1"><span class="nm">(h)</span><p>(R. Gershom requires him to say 'it is redeemed onto the biggest'. Ri Korkus explains the Rambam to say that the redemption occurs automatically, and that the biggest (even if it gets a Mum) cannot be redeemed onto the medium, for the Kedushah applies primarily to it. Tosfos Yom Tov - this case, the biggest is redeemed onto the medium and onto additional money (to make up the difference in value).)</p></div>
<div class="indent1"><span class="nm">(i)</span><p><span class="cl">(Rav Nachman):</span> This is only if he said 'one of my bulls (is a Korban)', but if he said 'a bull of my bulls', only the biggest is a Korban, for he means 'the most important.'</p></div>
<div class="indent1"><span class="nm">(j)</span><p><span class="cl">Question:</span> Rav Huna taught, if one said 'I sell to you a house of my houses', he shows (may give) to him (an) Aliyah;</p></div>
<div class="indent2"><span class="nm">1.</span><p><span class="cl">Suggestion:</span> (This refers to an attic.) It is inferior!</p></div>
<div class="indent1"><span class="nm">(k)</span><p><span class="cl">Answer #1:</span> No, 'Aliyah' means (he must give) 'Me'ulah' (the best) of his houses.</p></div>
<div class="indent1"><span class="nm">(l)</span><p><span class="cl">Question (Beraisa):</span> If one said 'a bull of my bulls is Hekdesh', and similarly if a Hekdesh bull became mixed with Chulin bulls, the biggest is a Korban.

<div class="indent1"><span class="nm">(m)</span><p><span class="cl">Answer:</span> 'The rest are sold for Olos' refers only to the mixture. (However, if one says 'a bull of my bulls is Hekdesh', all but the biggest are Chulin.)</p></div>
<div class="indent1"><span class="nm">(n)</span><p><span class="cl">Question:</span> It says 'and similarly'! (This implies that the same law applies to both!)</p></div>
<div class="indent1"><span class="nm">(o)</span><p><span class="cl">Answer:</span> 'Similarly', the biggest is a Korban. This applies to both cases.</p></div>
<div class="indent1"><span class="nm">(p)</span><p><span class="cl">Question (Beraisa):</span> If one said 'I sell to you a house of my houses' (or, 'a slave of my slaves'), and one of them fell (died), he can say that it is the one he sold.</p></div>
<div class="indent2"><span class="nm">1.</span><p>According to Rav Nachman, he cannot say this unless the best fell or died!</p></div>
<div class="indent1"><span class="nm">(q)</span><p><span class="cl">Answer:</span> The case of a buyer is different. The bearer of a document has the lower hand.</p></div>
