<p class="bas subject"><span class="nm">1)</span>A VOW AGAINST THE CREATIONS</p>
<p class="bas indent1"><span class="nm">(a)</span><span class="cl">Question (Rava, against Rav Nachman):</span> A Mishnah proves that when she says 'creations', she includes her husband!</p>
<p class="bas indent2"><span class="nm">1.</span><span class="cl">(Mishnah):</span> If a woman said 'I will not have Bi'ah with Yehudim', her husband annuls the part relevant to himself, and she is forbidden to all other Yisraelim.</p>
<p class="bas indent2"><span class="nm">2.</span><span class="cl">(Text of the Rosh):</span> If her husband is excluded, why must he annul the part relevant to himself?</p>
<p class="bas indent1"><span class="nm">(b)</span><span class="cl">Answer:</span> Normally, the husband is excluded. Here he is included, for we assume that she forbids to herself to one to whom she was permitted.</p>

<p class="bas indent1"><span class="nm">(a)</span><span class="cl">(Mishnah):</span> She can take Leket, Shichechah and Pe'ah.</p>
<p class="bas indent1"><span class="nm">(b)</span><span class="cl">Contradiction:</span> The Mishnah omits Ma'aser Oni (which is given to the poor), but a Beraisa teaches it!</p>
<p class="bas indent1"><span class="nm">(c)</span><span class="cl">Answer #1 (Rav Yosef):</span> The Beraisa is like R. Eliezer, and our Mishnah is like Chachamim.</p>
<p class="bas indent2"><span class="nm">1.</span><span class="cl">(Mishnah - R. Eliezer):</span> (Demai is produce bought from an ignoramus. Most ignoramuses take Ma'aser. Mid'Oraisa, Demai is permitted, but mid'Rabanan, one must be concerned for the minority and tithe it.) When tithing Demai, one need not be Korei Shem to (declare which part of the produce is) Ma'aser Oni. In any case the owner keeps it himself, for the poor cannot prove that Ma'aser Oni was not yet separated);</p>
<p class="bas bbbline">84b----------------------------------------84b</p>
<p class="bas indent2"><span class="nm">2.</span>Chachamim say, one must be Korei Shem, but he need not physically separate it.</p>
<p class="bas indent2"><span class="nm">3.</span><span class="cl">Suggestion:</span> The owner has Tovas Hana'ah (the privilege to decide to which Oni he will give it) only according to the opinion (Chachamim) that it is Tevel (forbids eating the produce before it is separated.) mi'Safek (the same applies to Vadai). Therefore, Chachamim forbid her to take it, for this is benefit from the owner;</p>
<p class="bas indent3"><span class="nm">i.</span>R. Eliezer permits Safek Tevel before Kri'as Shem, therefore the owner has no Tovas Hana'ah, so she may take it.</p>
<p class="bas indent1"><span class="nm">(d)</span><span class="cl">Answer #2 (Abaye):</span> All forbid even Safek Tevel before Kri'as Shem of Ma'aser Oni;</p>
<p class="bas indent2"><span class="nm">1.</span>R. Eliezer does not suspect that an ignoramus did not separate Ma'aser Oni.</p>
<p class="bas indent3"><span class="nm">i.</span>One (who does not want to give it away) can declare all his property Hefker. This makes him an Oni, and he may (separate and) take the Ma'aser Oni himself.</p>
<p class="bas indent2"><span class="nm">2.</span>Chachamim suspect that an ignoramus did not separate it;</p>
<p class="bas indent3"><span class="nm">i.</span>A person is afraid to make his property Hefker, lest someone else take it!</p>
<p class="bas indent1"><span class="nm">(e)</span><span class="cl">Answer #3 (Rava):</span> The Mishnah discusses Ma'aser Oni distributed from the owner's house. The Torah said this is given to the poor (so she may not take it, for this is benefiting from the owner);</p>
<p class="bas indent2"><span class="nm">1.</span>The Beraisa discusses Ma'aser Oni distributed from the granaries. The Torah said this is left for the poor. (She may take it, for this is not benefit from the owner.)</p>
<p class="bas subject"><span class="nm">3)</span>GIFTS AND TITHES FOR <i>KOHANIM</i> AND <i>LEVIYIM</i></p>
<p class="bas indent1"><span class="nm">(a)</span><span class="cl">(Mishnah):</span> If one said 'Kohanim and Leviyim may not benefit from me', they may take against his will...</p>
<p class="bas indent1"><span class="nm">(b)</span><span class="cl">Inference:</span> Tovas Hana'ah is not considered like money (a monetary stake in the gifts).</p>
<p class="bas indent1"><span class="nm">(c)</span><span class="cl">Question (Seifa):</span> If one said 'these Kohanim and Leviyim may not benefit from me', others take the gifts.</p>
<p class="bas indent2"><span class="nm">1.</span>Since the forbidden Kohanim and Leviyim cannot take, this shows that Tovas Hana'ah is like money!</p>
<p class="bas indent1"><span class="nm">(d)</span><span class="cl">Answer #1 (R. Hoshaya):</span> The Reisha is R. Yosi b'Rebbi Yehudah, and the Seifa is Rebbi:</p>
<p class="bas indent2"><span class="nm">1.</span><span class="cl">(Beraisa - Rebbi):</span> If one stole and ate Tevel (untithed produce), he pays the owner the value of Tevel (i.e. the Chulin, i.e. part which the owner keeps, and the Tovas Hana'ah of the gifts he must give);</p>
<p class="bas indent2"><span class="nm">2.</span>R. Yosi b'Rebbi Yehudah says, he only pays the value of the Chulin.</p>
<p class="bas indent2"><span class="nm">3.</span><span class="cl">Suggestion:</span> Rebbi holds that Tovas Hana'ah is money, and R. Yosi b'Rebbi Yehudah holds that it is not.</p>
