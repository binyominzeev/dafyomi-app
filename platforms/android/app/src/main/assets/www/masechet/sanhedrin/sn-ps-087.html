<p class="bas indent1"><span class="nm">(k)</span>"V'Kamta v'Alisa" teaches that the Beis ha'Mikdash is the highest place in Eretz Yisrael;</p>
<p class="bas indent2"><span class="nm">1.</span>Eretz Yisrael is the highest of all lands.</p>
<p class="bas indent1"><span class="nm">(l)</span>"El ha'Makom" - the Parshah applies only if they go to the Great Sanhedrin in Lishkas ha'Gazis.</p>
<p class="bas indent1"><span class="nm">(m)</span><span class="cl">Question:</span> Granted, "v'Kamta v'Alisa" teaches that the Beis ha'Mikdash is the highest place in Eretz Yisrael. (Wherever the Chacham and his Beis Din are, they ascend to the Mikdash);</p>
<p class="bas indent2"><span class="nm">1.</span>What is the source that Eretz Yisrael is the highest of all lands?</p>
<p class="bas indent1"><span class="nm">(n)</span><span class="cl">Answer:</span> "...Hash-m Asher He'elah... Beis Yisrael... umi'Kol ha'Aratzos Asher Hidachtim Sham (He will bring Yisrael <i>up</i> to Eretz Yisrael)."</p>
<p class="bas indent1"><span class="nm">(o)</span><span class="cl">(Beraisa #2 - R. Meir):</span> Zaken Mamrei is liable only for (ruling about) something punishable by Kares (if Mezid) and Chatas (if Shogeg);</p>
<p class="bas indent1"><span class="nm">(p)</span>R. Yehudah says, he is (also) liable for a law whose source is in the Torah, but the explanation is through Chachamim;</p>
<p class="bas indent1"><span class="nm">(q)</span>R. Shimon says, he is liable for a law that is (not explicit in the Torah at all, it is only) deduced by Chachamim.</p>
<p class="bas subject"><span class="nm">2)</span>REBBI MEIR'S OPINION</p>
<p class="bas indent1"><span class="nm">(a)</span><span class="cl">Question:</span> What is R. Meir's reason?</p>
<p class="bas indent1"><span class="nm">(b)</span><span class="cl">Answer:</span> He learns a Gezerah Shavah "Davar-Davar";</p>
<p class="bas indent2"><span class="nm">1.</span>It says here "Ki Yipalei Mimcha Davar", like it says (about Par He'elem Davar) "v'Nelam Davar me'Einei ha'Kahal." Just like there it refers to transgressions of Kares and Chatas, also here.</p>
<p class="bas indent1"><span class="nm">(c)</span>R. Yehudah learns from "Al Pi ha'Torah Asher Yorucha" - a law pertaining to (written) Torah <i>and</i> Hora'ah (of Chachamim);</p>
<p class="bas indent1"><span class="nm">(d)</span>R. Shimon learns from "Asher Yagidu Lecha Min ha'Makom ha'Hu" - even Kol d'Hu (any law).</p>
<p class="bas indent1"><span class="nm">(e)</span><span class="cl">Rav Huna bar Chinena:</span> Explain to me how Beraisa #1 can be R. Meir (that everything mentioned (Ibur Shanah, tradition from Moshe from Sinai, Gezerah Shavah...) is punishable by Kares and Chatas.</p>
<p class="bas indent1"><span class="nm">(f)</span><span class="cl">Rav Papa:</span> Regarding Ibur Shanah, the Chacham and the Sanhedrin argue about when we may be Me'aber the year:</p>
<p class="bas indent2"><span class="nm">1.</span><span class="cl">(Mishnah):</span> R. Yehoshua and R. Papyus testified that we may be Me'aber the year (before or) anytime during Adar;</p>
<p class="bas indent3"><span class="nm">i.</span>Chachamim used to say that it is permitted only until Purim.</p>
<p class="bas indent2"><span class="nm">2.</span>If Ibur Shanah was declared after Purim, they argue about when Pesach is. This pertains to Kares and Chatas (if one eats Chametz during what is truly Pesach).</p>
<p class="bas indent1"><span class="nm">(g)</span>They argue about a tradition from Moshe from Sinai regarding Dam Zivah:</p>
<p class="bas indent2"><span class="nm">1.</span><span class="cl">(R. Yochanan):</span> If a woman sees blood on the 10th day (of the 11 days of Zivah following Nidah), this is like seeing on the ninth. (Then, she must be Shomer (refrain from Bi'ah on) the next day, for she can become a full Zavah if she sees on the next two days. Also when she sees on the 10th, she can become a Zavah Ketanah if she will see on day 11);</p>
<p class="bas indent2"><span class="nm">2.</span><span class="cl">(Reish Lakish):</span> Seeing on the 10th day is like seeing on the 11th. (Then, she need not be Shomer the next day, for any future blood is not Dam Zivah, rather Dam Nidah. Even though when she sees on the 10th she could become a Zavah Ketanah, a Halachah from Sinai teaches that Shimur does not apply.)</p>
<p class="bas indent1"><span class="nm">(h)</span>They argue about the Isur of a man to his daughter from a woman he raped (or enticed);</p>
<p class="bas bbbline">87b----------------------------------------87b</p>
<p class="bas indent2"><span class="nm">1.</span><span class="cl">(Rava):</span> We learn from Gezeros Shavah "Henah-Henah" and "Zimah-Zimah."</p>
<p class="bas indent1"><span class="nm">(i)</span>They argue about Dam Nidah as the following Tana'im do:</p>
<p class="bas indent2"><span class="nm">1.</span><span class="cl">(Mishnah - Akavya ben Mahalal'el):</span> Yarok blood is Metamei (makes a woman a Nidah. Almost all Rishonim say that (plain) Yarok is yellow. Green is called Yarok k'Karsi. Me'iri - Yarok is green, but all are Metamei yellow);</p>
<p class="bas indent2"><span class="nm">2.</span>Chachamim are Metaher.</p>
<p class="bas indent1"><span class="nm">(j)</span>They argue about blood of childbirth as Rav and Levi do. (Any blood that a woman sees from day 8 through day 40 after the birth of a boy, or from day 15 through day 80 after the birth of a girl, is called Dam Tohar. It is Tahor, and is not Metamei her. Blood she sees at any other time is Tamei, and it is Metamei her);</p>
<p class="bas indent2"><span class="nm">1.</span><span class="cl">(Rav):</span> There is one source for both Dam Tamei and Dam Tohar. The Torah decrees when the blood is Tamei, and when it is Tahor;</p>
<p class="bas indent2"><span class="nm">2.</span><span class="cl">(Levi):</span> Dam Tamei and Dam Tohar come from different sources. (They argue about a woman who, at the start (or end) of the days of Dam Tohar, was in the middle of a flow of blood. Levi holds that in this case, we assume that all the blood (until the flow ceases) is from the source from which the flow began, and it is Tamei (or Tahor) like the beginning of the flow in the days of Dam Tamei (or Tohar). Rav says that even though it is from one source, the Torah changes its status when she begins (or ends) the days of Dam Tohar.)</p>
<p class="bas indent1"><span class="nm">(k)</span>They argue about blood of Zivah as R. Eliezer and R. Yehoshua do:</p>
<p class="bas indent2"><span class="nm">1.</span><span class="cl">(Mishnah - R. Eliezer):</span> If a woman saw Dam Zivah three consecutive days amidst Koshi (labor pains) and ceased Koshi for 24 consecutive hours before giving birth, (we do not attribute the blood to the birth;) she is Yoledes b'Zov (a Zavah who gave birth. Dam Tohar does not apply to her);</p>
<p class="bas indent2"><span class="nm">2.</span>R. Yehoshua says, this is only if she ceased Koshi for a Halachic day (a night followed by the day, like Shabbos).</p>
<p class="bas indent3"><span class="nm">i.</span>She must cease from pain. It does not matter whether or not she ceased seeing blood.</p>
<p class="bas indent1"><span class="nm">(l)</span>They argue about monetary cases as Shmuel and R. Avahu do:</p>
<p class="bas indent2"><span class="nm">1.</span><span class="cl">(Shmuel):</span> If two judged a monetary case, the verdict stands, just it is called an impudent Beis Din.</p>
<p class="bas indent2"><span class="nm">2.</span><span class="cl">(R. Avahu):</span> All agree that this is not a judgment.</p>
<p class="bas indent1"><span class="nm">(m)</span>They argue about capital cases as Rebbi and Chachamim do:</p>
<p class="bas indent2"><span class="nm">1.</span><span class="cl">(Beraisa - Rebbi):</span> "V'Nosata Nefesh Tachas Nafesh" refers to money. (If Ploni intended to kill Reuven, and killed Shimon, he pays money.)</p>
<p class="bas indent2"><span class="nm">2.</span><span class="cl">Suggestion:</span> Perhaps it refers to capital punishment (like Chachamim hold)!</p>
<p class="bas indent2"><span class="nm">3.</span><span class="cl">Rejection:</span> It says 'Nesinah' here, and also regarding compensation for causing a miscarriage;</p>
<p class="bas indent3"><span class="nm">i.</span>Just like the latter refers to money, also here.</p>
<p class="bas indent1"><span class="nm">(n)</span>They argue about lashes as R. Yishmael and Chachamim do:</p>
<p class="bas indent2"><span class="nm">1.</span><span class="cl">(Mishnah):</span> Cases of lashes require three judges;</p>
<p class="bas indent2"><span class="nm">2.</span>R. Yishmael says, they require 23.</p>
<p class="bas indent1"><span class="nm">(o)</span>Regarding Tzara'as of people, they argue as R. Yehoshua and Chachamim do:</p>
<p class="bas indent2"><span class="nm">1.</span>If Baheres (a white appearance on the skin) preceded the white hair, he is Muchlat (absolutely Tamei). If the white hair came first, he is Tahor (i.e. Musgar, i.e. only quarantined);</p>
<p class="bas indent2"><span class="nm">2.</span>If we are in doubt which came first, he is Tamei;</p>
<p class="bas indent2"><span class="nm">3.</span>R. Yehoshua says, Kehah.</p>
<p class="bas indent2"><span class="nm">4.</span><span class="cl">Question:</span> What does this mean?</p>
<p class="bas indent2"><span class="nm">5.</span><span class="cl">Answer (Rabah):</span> It is as if the Tzara'as became weaker, and he is Tahor.</p>
<p class="bas indent1"><span class="nm">(p)</span>Regarding Tzara'as of houses, they argue as R. Elazar bar Shimon and Chachamim do:</p>
<p class="bas indent2"><span class="nm">1.</span><span class="cl">(Mishnah - R. Elazar b'Rebbi Shimon):</span> A Bayis ha'Menuga must have appearances (of Tzara'as) the size of a Gris on each of two stones that touch in the corner (and the appearances touch each other).</p>
<p class="bas indent2"><span class="nm">2.</span><span class="cl">Question:</span> What is his reason?</p>
<p class="bas indent2"><span class="nm">3.</span><span class="cl">Answer:</span> It says "Kir", and it says "Kiros";</p>
<p class="bas indent3"><span class="nm">i.</span>A wall that is like two walls is the corner.</p>
