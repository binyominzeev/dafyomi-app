<div class="indent1"><span class="nm">(a)</span><p><span class="cl">Question (Rav Acha brei d'Rava):</span> If we will say that "Lo Yavdil" means that he need not separate, we should also say (regarding a pit) "v'Lo Yechasenu" means that he need not cover it!</p></div>
<div class="indent1"><span class="nm">(b)</span><p><span class="cl">Answer (Rav Ashi):</span> No. Since it says "Ba'al ha'Bor Yeshalem", clearly, it is incumbent on him to cover it;</p></div>
<div class="indent2"><span class="nm">1.</span><p>Here, it says "v'Hikrivo". The Torah already taught that Chatas ha'Of is offered differently than Olas ha'Of (i.e. he does not cut both Simanim);</p></div>
<div class="indent2"><span class="nm">2.</span><p>Therefore, "Lo Yavdil" teaches that he <i>need</i> not (but he may) separate.</p></div>
<div class="indent1"><span class="nm">(c)</span><p><span class="cl">(Mishnah):</span> He squeezes out the blood from the body.</p></div>
<div class="indent1"><span class="nm">(d)</span><p><span class="cl">(Beraisa):</span> "Olah" - it is Kosher even if he squeezed out the blood of the body but not of the head;</p></div>
<div class="indent2"><span class="nm">1.</span><p><span class="cl">Suggestion:</span> Perhaps it is Kosher even if he squeezed out the blood of the head but not of the body!</p></div>
<div class="indent2"><span class="nm">2.</span><p><span class="cl">Rejection:</span> "Hu" (it is Kosher only if done properly).</p></div>
<div class="indent2"><span class="nm">3.</span><p><span class="cl">Question:</span> How does this teach that the former is Kosher but not the latter?</p></div>
<div class="indent2"><span class="nm">4.</span><p><span class="cl">Answer (Ravina):</span> Presumably, we are more concerned for the blood of the body, for there is more blood in the body than in the head.</p></div>

<div class="indent1"><span class="nm">(a)</span><p>If Chatas ha'Of was offered below, like (i.e. according to the Avodah of) Chatas (ha'Of), l'Shem Chatas, it is Kosher. (This is no Chidush, it is merely for parallel structure to the coming clauses.)</p></div>
<div class="indent1"><span class="nm">(b)</span><p>If it was offered (below) like Chatas but l'Shem Olah, or like Olah but l'Shem Chatas, or like Olah l'Shem Olah, it is Pasul;</p></div>
<div class="indent1"><span class="nm">(c)</span><p>If it was offered above, in any case it is Pasul.</p></div>
<div class="indent1"><span class="nm">(d)</span><p>If Olas ha'Of was offered above, like Olah, l'Shem Olah, it is Kosher;</p></div>
<div class="indent1"><span class="nm">(e)</span><p>If it was offered (above) like Olah but l'Shem Chatas, it is Kosher, but the owner was not Yotzei;</p></div>
<div class="indent1"><span class="nm">(f)</span><p>If it was offered (above) like Chatas, whether it was l'Shem Olah or l'Shem Chatas, it is Pasul;</p></div>

<div class="indent1"><span class="nm">(h)</span><p><span class="cl">(Gemara) Question:</span> (When it was done 'like an Olah',) how did he deviate from the Avodah of a Chatas?</p></div>
<div class="indent1"><span class="nm">(i)</span><p><span class="cl">Answer #1:</span> He did Melikah of an Olah (he cut both Simanim).</p></div>
<div class="indent2"><span class="nm">1.</span><p><span class="cl">Question:</span> If so, our Mishnah is not like R. Elazar b'Rebbi Shimon, for he says that this is Kosher in Chatas ha'Of!</p></div>
<div class="indent2"><span class="nm">2.</span><p><span class="cl">Answer:</span> There is nothing wrong with this. We already established the previous Mishnah unlike him!</p></div>
<div class="indent1"><span class="nm">(j)</span><p><span class="cl">Answer #2:</span> (Our Mishnah can even be like R. Elazar.) He deviated regarding Haza'ah (he omitted it; he only did Mitzuy).</p></div>
<div class="indent1"><span class="nm">(k)</span><p><span class="cl">Support (Seifa):</span> If it was offered above, in any case it is Pasul;</p></div>
<div class="indent2"><span class="nm">1.</span><p>This is even if it was like Chatas l'Shem Chatas.</p></div>

<div class="indent3"><span class="nm">i.</span><p>It cannot mean, he did Melikah above. We learned that Melikah is Kosher anywhere on the Mizbe'ach!</p></div>
<div class="indent2"><span class="nm">3.</span><p><span class="cl">Answer:</span> He did Haza'ah above.</p></div>
<div class="indent2"><span class="nm">4.</span><p><span class="cl">Culmination of support:</span> Just like the Seifa refers to (a deviation in) Haza'ah, also the Reisha.</p></div>
<div class="indent1"><span class="nm">(l)</span><p><span class="cl">Rejection of support:</span> No, each clause refers to something else.</p></div>
<div class="indent1"><span class="nm">(m)</span><p><span class="cl">(Mishnah):</span> Olas ha'Of...</p></div>

<div class="indent1"><span class="nm">(o)</span><p><span class="cl">Answer #1:</span> He did Melikah of a Chatas (he cut only one Siman).</p></div>
<div class="indent1"><span class="nm">(p)</span><p><span class="cl">Rejection:</span> If so, the coming Mishnah would be unlike R. Yehoshua! (This is difficult, for R. Yehoshua argues with R. Eliezer, who is from Beis Shamai.)</p></div>
<div class="indent2"><span class="nm">1.</span><p><span class="cl">(The coming Mishnah):</span> In all of the above cases, Tum'as Beis ha'Beli'ah (if one who eats the Neveilah of a Tahor bird, he and his clothing become Tamei) does not apply, but Me'ilah applies (to one who benefits from the bird);</p></div>
<div class="indent2"><span class="nm">2.</span><p>R. Yehoshua says, there is no Me'ilah (for it becomes Chatas ha'Of, and Kohanim eat it)!</p></div>
<div class="indent1"><span class="nm">(q)</span><p><span class="cl">Answer #2:</span> Rather, he deviated in Mitzuy. (He omitted it, and did Haza'ah instead. R. Yehoshua admits that Me'ilah applies in this case, for it does not become Chatas ha'Of.)</p></div>
<div class="indent1"><span class="nm">(r)</span><p><span class="cl">Question (Seifa of the next Mishnah - R. Eliezer):</span> If Olas ha'Of was offered below like Chatas l'Shem Chatas, there is Me'ilah;</p></div>

<div class="indent3"><span class="nm">ii.</span><p><span class="cl">Rejection:</span> R. Yehoshua exempts from Me'ilah only when Melikah was like a Chatas (for it becomes a Chatas). Otherwise he would agree that there is Me'ilah!</p></div>

<div class="indent2"><span class="nm">4.</span><p><span class="cl">Summation of question:</span> Can we say that our Mishnah and the Seifa of the next Mishnah discuss (deviations in) Melikah, and the beginning of the next Mishnah (which is in between these) discusses Mitzuy?!</p></div>

<div class="indent1"><span class="nm">(b)</span><p>R. Eliezer says, if Olas ha'Of was offered below like Chatas l'Shem Chatas, there is Me'ilah;</p></div>

<div class="indent2"><span class="nm">1.</span><p><span class="cl">R. Eliezer:</span> There is no Me'ilah in a Chatas offered Lishmah, but there is when it is offered l'Shem something else.

<div class="indent2"><span class="nm">2.</span><p><span class="cl">R. Yehoshua:</span> There is Me'ilah in Chatas l'Shem Olah, for it was offered l'Shem something which has Me'ilah. You cannot learn to Olah l'Shem Chatas, for it was offered l'Shem something which has no Me'ilah!</p></div>
