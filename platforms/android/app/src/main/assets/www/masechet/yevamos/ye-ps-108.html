<p class="bas subject"><span class="nm">1)</span>WHAT CONSTITUTES <i>MI'UN</i>?</p>
<p class="bas indent1"><span class="nm">(a)</span><span class="cl">(Beraisa):</span> Mi'un is when she says 'I do not want my husband. I do not want the Kidushin that my mother and brothers made for me';</p>
<p class="bas indent1"><span class="nm">(b)</span>R. Yehudah says even further. Even if she is sitting in the carriage going from her father's house to her husband's house for Chupah, and she said 'I do not want my husband', this is Mi'un.</p>
<p class="bas indent1"><span class="nm">(c)</span>R. Yehudah says even further. Even if she is serving guests who are sitting in her husband's house, and she told them 'I do not want my husband', this is Mi'un.</p>
<p class="bas indent1"><span class="nm">(d)</span>R. Yosi bar Yehudah said even further. Even if her husband sent her to the grocer to bring an item, and she said 'I do not want my husband', this is the ultimate Mi'un.</p>
<p class="bas indent1"><span class="nm">(e)</span><span class="cl">(Mishnah - R. Chanina ben Antigonus):</span> Any girl (who cannot guard her Kidushin need not do Mi'un).</p>
<p class="bas indent1"><span class="nm">(f)</span><span class="cl">(Rav Yehudah):</span> The Halachah follows R. Chanina.</p>
<p class="bas indent1"><span class="nm">(g)</span><span class="cl">(Beraisa - R. Yehudah ben Beseirah):</span> If a girl did not do Mi'un, but had Nisu'in (with another man), this is her Mi'un.</p>
<p class="bas indent1"><span class="nm">(h)</span><span class="cl">Question:</span> If she became Mekudeshes (to another man), is this Mi'un?</p>
<p class="bas indent1"><span class="nm">(i)</span><span class="cl">Answer (Beraisa - R. Yehudah ben Beseirah):</span> If a girl became Mekudeshes (to another man), this is her Mi'un.</p>
<p class="bas indent1"><span class="nm">(j)</span><span class="cl">Questions:</span> Do Chachamim argue with R. Yehudah ben Beseirah?</p>
<p class="bas indent2"><span class="nm">1.</span>If they argue, do they argue only about Kidushin, or even about Nisu'in?</p>
<p class="bas indent2"><span class="nm">2.</span>If they argue even about Nisu'in, does the Halachah follow R. Yehudah?</p>
<p class="bas indent2"><span class="nm">3.</span>If the Halachah follows R. Yehudah, is this only regarding Nisu'in, or even regarding Kidushin?</p>
<p class="bas indent1"><span class="nm">(k)</span><span class="cl">Answer:</span> Rav Yehudah said that the Halachah follows R. Yehudah ben Beseirah (in both cases).</p>
<p class="bas indent2"><span class="nm">1.</span>This implies that Chachamim argue.</p>
<p class="bas indent1"><span class="nm">(l)</span><span class="cl">Question:</span> Is this Mi'un to uproot even Nisu'in, or only to uproot Kidushin?</p>
<p class="bas indent1"><span class="nm">(m)</span><span class="cl">Answer:</span> A case occurred, and Avdan's daughters-in-law rebelled. Rebbi sent two Chachamim to check them;</p>
<p class="bas indent2"><span class="nm">1.</span>Women told the girls 'look, your husbands are coming.'</p>
<p class="bas indent2"><span class="nm">2.</span><span class="cl">The girls:</span> They (our husbands) should be your husbands!</p>
<p class="bas indent2"><span class="nm">3.</span><span class="cl">Rebbi:</span> This is the ultimate Mi'un.</p>
<p class="bas indent2"><span class="nm">4.</span><span class="cl">Suggestion:</span> This was from Nisu'in (and implicit Mi'un sufficed)!</p>
<p class="bas indent1"><span class="nm">(n)</span><span class="cl">Rejection:</span> No, this was from Eirusin.</p>
<p class="bas indent1"><span class="nm">(o)</span>The Halachah follows R. Yehudah ben Beseirah, even from Nisu'in.</p>
<p class="bas subject"><span class="nm">2)</span>THE RABBINIC MARRIAGE OF A MINOR</p>
<p class="bas indent1"><span class="nm">(a)</span><span class="cl">(Mishnah - R. Elazar):</span> (The actions of a minor have no effect...)</p>
<p class="bas indent1"><span class="nm">(b)</span><span class="cl">(Rav Yehudah):</span> We do not find a Chacham as consistent about a minor as R. Eliezer;</p>
<p class="bas indent2"><span class="nm">1.</span>He considers her like one who strolls with her husband in the courtyard, gets up from his lap, immerses and eats Terumah after nightfall (if she is a Bas Kohen, even if her husband is a Yisrael).</p>
<p class="bas indent1"><span class="nm">(c)</span><span class="cl">(Beraisa - R. Eliezer):</span> The action of a minor has no effect. Her husband does not receive her Metzi'os (Hefker objects that she finds) or earnings. He cannot annul her vows. He does not inherit her. He cannot become Tamei to engage in her burial (if he is a Kohen). The rule is, she is not as his wife in any respect, except that she must do Mi'un (to marry someone else);</p>
<p class="bas indent1"><span class="nm">(d)</span>R. Yehoshua says, her husband receives her Metzi'os and earnings. He can annul her vows. He inherits her. He becomes Tamei to engage in her burial. The rule is, she is like his wife in every respect, except that she can leave through Mi'un;</p>
<p class="bas indent1"><span class="nm">(e)</span><span class="cl">Rebbi:</span> R. Eliezer's opinion is preferable to R. Yehoshua's, since R. Eliezer is consistent, and R. Yehoshua is inconsistent.</p>
<p class="bas indent1"><span class="nm">(f)</span><span class="cl">Question:</span> In what way is R. Yehoshua inconsistent?</p>
<p class="bas indent1"><span class="nm">(g)</span><span class="cl">Answer:</span> If she is his wife, she should require a Get.</p>
<p class="bas indent1"><span class="nm">(h)</span><span class="cl">Question:</span> According to R. Eliezer, if she is not his wife she should not need even Mi'un!</p>
<p class="bas indent1"><span class="nm">(i)</span><span class="cl">Answer:</span> Should she go out with nothing?!</p>
<p class="bas indent1"><span class="nm">(j)</span><span class="cl">(Mishnah - R. Eliezer ben Yakov):</span> (If the husband is the hindrance...)</p>
<p class="bas indent1"><span class="nm">(k)</span><span class="cl">Question:</span> When is the hindrance due to the husband, and when not?</p>
<p class="bas indent1"><span class="nm">(l)</span><span class="cl">Answer #1 (Rav Yehudah):</span> If other men asked her to marry them, and she refused because she is already married, the husband is the hindrance;</p>
<p class="bas indent2"><span class="nm">1.</span>If she refused because they are not fitting for her, he is not the hindrance.</p>
<p class="bas indent1"><span class="nm">(m)</span><span class="cl">Answer #2 (Abaye bar Avin):</span> If he gave her a Get, this is a hindrance due to the husband, and he is forbidden to her relatives, and she is forbidden to his, and she is disqualified from Kehunah;</p>
<p class="bas indent2"><span class="nm">1.</span>If she did Mi'un, this is a hindrance not due to him. Each is permitted to the other's relatives, and she is not disqualified from Kehunah.</p>
<p class="bas indent1"><span class="nm">(n)</span><span class="cl">Objection (the coming Mishnah):</span> If she did Mi'un, each is permitted to the other's relatives, and she is not disqualified from Kehunah;</p>
<p class="bas indent2"><span class="nm">1.</span>If he gave her a Get, each is forbidden to the other's relatives, and she is disqualified from Kehunah. (According to Abaye, this was already taught!)</p>
<p class="bas indent1"><span class="nm">(o)</span><span class="cl">Answer:</span> The next Mishnah elucidates what our Mishnah alludes to.</p>
<p class="bas subject"><span class="nm">3)</span><i>MI'UN</i> AND A <i>GET</i> FROM THE SAME MAN</p>
<p class="bas indent1"><span class="nm">(a)</span><span class="cl">(Mishnah):</span> If a girl does Mi'un to her husband, he is permitted to her relatives, she is permitted to his relatives, and she is not disqualified from Kehunah;</p>
<p class="bas indent1"><span class="nm">(b)</span>If he gave her a Get, each is forbidden to the other's relatives, and she is disqualified from Kehunah.</p>
<p class="bas indent1"><span class="nm">(c)</span>If he gave her a Get and remarried her, and she did Mi'un, married someone else, and was widowed or divorced, she may return to her first husband;</p>
<p class="bas indent1"><span class="nm">(d)</span>If she did Mi'un and he remarried her and divorced her, and she married someone else, and was widowed or divorced, she may not return to her first husband.</p>
<p class="bas bbbline">108b----------------------------------------108b</p>
<p class="bas indent1"><span class="nm">(e)</span>The rule is, if the Get followed the Mi'un, she may not return to her first husband. If the Mi'un followed the Get, she may return.</p>
<p class="bas indent1"><span class="nm">(f)</span>A girl did Mi'un, married someone else, and was divorced. She married someone else and did Mi'un. She married another man, and was divorced. The rule is, she may not return to one who divorced her, but she may return to one she did Mi'un to.</p>
<p class="bas indent1"><span class="nm">(g)</span><span class="cl">(Gemara):</span> The Reisha shows that that Mi'un nullifies the effects of a Get.</p>
<p class="bas indent1"><span class="nm">(h)</span><span class="cl">Contradiction (Seifa):</span> If a girl did Mi'un, she married someone else and was divorced... the rule is, she may return to one she did Mi'un to, but not to one who divorced her.</p>
<p class="bas indent2"><span class="nm">1.</span>This shows that Mi'un to a man does not nullify another man's Get!</p>
<p class="bas indent1"><span class="nm">(i)</span><span class="cl">Answer #1 (Rav Yehudah):</span> We must say that different Tana'im taught the Reisha and the Seifa.</p>
<p class="bas indent1"><span class="nm">(j)</span><span class="cl">Answer #2 (Rava):</span> We need not say this! Mi'un to a man nullifies his Get, but not another man's Get!</p>
<p class="bas indent1"><span class="nm">(k)</span><span class="cl">Question:</span> Why should we distinguish?</p>
<p class="bas indent1"><span class="nm">(l)</span><span class="cl">Answer:</span> Since she recognizes the gestures and winking of a man who divorced her, if he would be permitted to remarry her, he will cause her to do Mi'un to her new husband to remarry him.</p>
<p class="bas indent1"><span class="nm">(m)</span><span class="cl">Question:</span> For the same reason, we should say that Mi'un to a man does not nullify his Get!</p>
<p class="bas indent1"><span class="nm">(n)</span><span class="cl">Answer:</span> She chose to leave him, so we are not concerned lest she heed his gestures.</p>
<p class="bas subject"><span class="nm">4)</span>DOES <i>MI'UN</i> TO A MAN NULLIFY ANOTHER MAN'S <i>GET</i>?</p>
<p class="bas indent1"><span class="nm">(a)</span><span class="cl">Question:</span> There is a contradiction about when she left the same man!</p>
<p class="bas indent2"><span class="nm">1.</span><span class="cl">(Mishnah):</span> If she did Mi'un and he remarried her and divorced her, and she married someone else, and was widowed or divorced, she may not return to her first husband.</p>
<p class="bas indent3"><span class="nm">i.</span><span class="cl">Inference:</span> Had she left the second husband through Mi'un, she could return to hr first husband.</p>
<p class="bas indent3"><span class="nm">ii.</span>This shows that Mi'un to a man nullifies another man's Get.</p>
<p class="bas indent2"><span class="nm">2.</span>Contradiction (Seifa):	A girl did Mi'un, married someone else, and was divorced. She married someone else and did Mi'un. She married another man, and was divorced. The rule is, she may not return to one who divorced her, but she may return to one she did Mi'un to.</p>
<p class="bas indent1"><span class="nm">(b)</span><span class="cl">Answer #1 (R. Elazar):</span> Different Tana'im taught the Reisha and the Seifa.</p>
<p class="bas indent1"><span class="nm">(c)</span><span class="cl">Answer #2 (Ula):</span> The case is, she was divorced three times. This makes her look like an adult, so we do not allow Mi'un to nullify a Get.</p>
<p class="bas indent1"><span class="nm">(d)</span><span class="cl">Question:</span> Who are the Tana'im [of the Reisha and Seifa our Mishnah, according to R. Elazar]?</p>
<p class="bas indent1"><span class="nm">(e)</span><span class="cl">Answer:</span> We learn from the following episode. (Rav is considered a Tana. He holds that Mi'un does not annul another man's Get, and R. Yishmael b'Rebbi Yosi holds that it does):</p>
<p class="bas indent2"><span class="nm">1.</span><span class="cl">(Rav):</span> "We bought our water for money, our water comes for a price" - the following question arose at a time of danger (when the kingdom forbade learning Torah).</p>
<p class="bas indent2"><span class="nm">2.</span><span class="cl">Question:</span> If a man divorced a girl, and she married a man and did Mi'un, may she return to her first husband?</p>
<p class="bas indent2"><span class="nm">3.</span><span class="cl">Answer:</span> A man was hired for 400 Zuz to ask this of R. Akiva in jail. He said that she is forbidden. R. Yehudah ben Beseirah said the same.</p>
<p class="bas indent2"><span class="nm">4.</span><span class="cl">R. Yishmael b'Rebbi Yosi:</span> They did not need to ask this. We permit (Eshes Ish, which when it is mid'Oraisa is) Chayavei Kerisos through Mi'un, all the more so we permit Chayavei Lavin (Machazir Gerushaso)! Rather, they asked the following;</p>
<p class="bas indent2"><span class="nm">5.</span><span class="cl">Question:</span> Leah was married to Reuven's mother's brother, which makes her a Sheniyah to Reuven. After her husband died, she married Levi, Reuven's paternal brother, and Levi died. May Leah do Mi'un to uproot her first marriage, to permit Yibum? I.e., may she do Mi'un after her husband died to permit Yibum?</p>
<p class="bas indent2"><span class="nm">6.</span>Two men were hired for 400 Zuz to ask R. Akiva and R. Yehudah ben Beseirah. Both forbade.</p>
<p class="bas indent1"><span class="nm">(f)</span><span class="cl">Version #1 (R. Yitzchak bar Ashi'an):</span> Rav (who forbids a girl who did Mi'un to remarry a prior ex-husband who divorced her) agrees that she is permitted to her ex-husband's brother.</p>
<p class="bas indent1"><span class="nm">(g)</span><span class="cl">Question:</span> This is obvious! The only concern was that she recognizes his winking. This does not apply to his brother!</p>
<p class="bas indent1"><span class="nm">(h)</span><span class="cl">Answer:</span> One might have thought that we decree to forbid the brother due to her ex-husband (lest she come to marry him). R. Yitzchak teaches that this is not so.</p>
<p class="bas indent1"><span class="nm">(i)</span><span class="cl">Version #2 (R. Yitzchak bar Ashi'an):</span> Just like she may not remarry her ex-husband, she is forbidden to her ex-husband's brother.</p>
<p class="bas indent1"><span class="nm">(j)</span><span class="cl">Question:</span> Why is she forbidden? She does not recognize his gestures!</p>
<p class="bas indent1"><span class="nm">(k)</span><span class="cl">Answer:</span> We decree to forbid the brother due to her ex-husband.</p>
