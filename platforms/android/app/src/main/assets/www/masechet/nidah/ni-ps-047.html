<p class="bas subject"><span class="nm">1)</span>THE <i>CHIYUV</i> OF <i>TERUMAH</i> AND <i>CHALAH</i> NOWADAYS</p>
<p class="bas indent1"><span class="nm">(a)</span><span class="cl">Support (Beraisa - R. Meir and R. Yehudah):</span> If a dough became Dimu'a (mixed with Terumah) or was fermented with Se'or of Terumah, one must take Chalah from it. If a Tevul Yom touches it, he does not disqualify it;</p>
<p class="bas indent1"><span class="nm">(b)</span>R. Yosi and R. Shimon exempt it from Chalah.</p>
<p class="bas indent2"><span class="nm">1.</span>We are thinking that Terumah and Chalah have the same law. Whoever says that one is mid'Oraisa says that both are.</p>
<p class="bas indent2"><span class="nm">2.</span>We understand if (R. Yosi holds that) Chalah is mid'Rabanan. Even though the Torah permits Dimu'a (the Terumah is Batel) like Chulin, mid'Rabanan it is like Terumah, and this uproots the obligation mid'Rabanan to take Chalah;</p>
<p class="bas indent2"><span class="nm">3.</span>However, if Chalah were mid'Oraisa, since Dimu'a is like Terumah mid'Rabanan, it could not uproot the Torah obligation to separate Chalah!</p>
<p class="bas indent1"><span class="nm">(c)</span><span class="cl">Answer:</span> Perhaps he holds like Rav Huna brei d'Rav Yehoshua, that nowadays Terumah is mid'Oraisa, and Chalah is mid'Rabanan;</p>
<p class="bas indent2"><span class="nm">1.</span><span class="cl">(Rabanan):</span> Even according to the opinion that nowadays Terumah is mid'Rabanan, Chalah is mid'Oraisa;</p>
<p class="bas indent2"><span class="nm">2.</span>We find that during the 14 years of conquering and dividing, Bnei Yisrael were obligated to take Chalah, but not Terumah!</p>
<p class="bas indent2"><span class="nm">3.</span><span class="cl">Rejection (Rav Huna brei d'Rav Yehoshua):</span> No. Rather, even according to the opinion that nowadays Terumah is mid'Oraisa, Chalah is mid'Rabanan;</p>
<p class="bas indent3"><span class="nm">i.</span><span class="cl">(Beraisa) Suggestion:</span> Perhaps "(you will take Chalah) b'Vo'achem" obligates separating Chalah once two or three spies of Yisrael enter Eretz Yisrael!</p>
<p class="bas indent3"><span class="nm">ii.</span><span class="cl">Rejection:</span> "B'Vo'a<i>chem</i>" (plural) discusses when all (i.e. the majority) enter, but not when the minority enters;</p>
<p class="bas indent3"><span class="nm">iii.</span>When Ezra brought exiles back to Eretz Yisrael (to build the second Beis ha'Mikdash), the majority stayed in Bavel.</p>
<p class="bas subject"><span class="nm">2)</span>UPPER <i>SIMANIM</i> IN A WOMAN</p>
<p class="bas indent1"><span class="nm">(a)</span><span class="cl">(Mishnah):</span> The three stages of female maturity parallel ripening fruit -- Pagah, Bochel and Tzemel:</p>
<p class="bas indent2"><span class="nm">1.</span>Pagah (unripe fruit) corresponds to a woman without any Siman. She is a minor in every respect;</p>
<p class="bas indent2"><span class="nm">2.</span>Bochel (partially grown fruit) corresponds to a Na'arah;</p>
<p class="bas indent3"><span class="nm">i.</span>In both of these stages, her father receives what she finds or earns, and he can annul her vows.</p>
<p class="bas indent2"><span class="nm">3.</span>Tzemel refers to full maturity, i.e. a Bogeres. Her father has no jurisdiction over her.</p>
<p class="bas indent1"><span class="nm">(b)</span>Tana'im give different Simanim (Rashi - of Bagrus; Tosfos - of Na'arus) based on how developed the breasts are.</p>
<p class="bas indent1"><span class="nm">(c)</span><span class="cl">(Gemara):</span> Pagah corresponds to a minor -- "ha'Te'enah Chantah Fageha" (it budded, which is the beginning of fruit);</p>
<p class="bas indent1"><span class="nm">(d)</span>Bochel corresponds to a Na'arah;</p>
<p class="bas indent2"><span class="nm">1.</span><span class="cl">(Mishnah):</span> After figs Yivchelu (mature), they must be tithed;</p>
<p class="bas indent2"><span class="nm">2.</span><span class="cl">(Rabah bar bar Chanah):</span> This is when the ends become white.</p>
<p class="bas indent1"><span class="nm">(e)</span>Tzemel is an acronym for Yatz'ah Mele'ah (full maturity).</p>
<p class="bas indent1"><span class="nm">(f)</span><span class="cl">(Mishnah - R. Yosi ha'Gelili):</span> The Siman...</p>
<p class="bas indent1"><span class="nm">(g)</span>Shmuel had an idea regarding R. Yosi's Siman. He tested it on his Shifchah (Kena'anis), and paid her four Zuz compensation for embarrassment.</p>
<p class="bas indent2"><span class="nm">1.</span><span class="cl">(Shmuel):</span> "L'Olam Bahem Ta'avodu" teaches that slaves are for labor. One may not embarrass them.</p>
<p class="bas indent1"><span class="nm">(h)</span>Shmuel would designate one slave to be a "husband" for each Shifchah, to spare his Shifchos from embarrassment;</p>
<p class="bas indent1"><span class="nm">(i)</span>Rav Nachman would switch their marital partners. He was not concerned for their embarrassment;</p>
<p class="bas indent1"><span class="nm">(j)</span>Rav Sheshes gave them over to an Aravi (who would have Bi'ah freely with them), and told them not to have Bi'ah with Yisraelim.</p>
<p class="bas indent1"><span class="nm">(k)</span>A Beraisa gives other opinions about Simanim of Bagrus.</p>
<p class="bas bbbline">47b----------------------------------------47b</p>
<p class="bas indent1"><span class="nm">(l)</span><span class="cl">(Beraisa - R. Shimon):</span> Chachamim gave three Simanim below in a woman, and three above;</p>
<p class="bas indent2"><span class="nm">1.</span>If above is Pagah (undeveloped), surely she did not bring hairs below;</p>
<p class="bas indent2"><span class="nm">2.</span>If above is Bochel (partially developed), surely she brought hairs below;</p>
<p class="bas indent2"><span class="nm">3.</span>If above is Tzemel (fully developed), surely the Kaf is leveled.</p>
<p class="bas indent1"><span class="nm">(m)</span><span class="cl">Question:</span> What is the Kaf?</p>
<p class="bas indent1"><span class="nm">(n)</span><span class="cl">Answer (Rav Huna):</span> It is a protrusion above the Ervah. When she matures, it gets smaller and goes away.</p>
<p class="bas subject"><span class="nm">3)</span>THE HALACHAH</p>
<p class="bas indent1"><span class="nm">(a)</span><span class="cl">Question:</span> Whom does the Halachah follow?</p>
<p class="bas indent1"><span class="nm">(b)</span><span class="cl">Answer (Rebbi):</span> We are stringent like all of the opinions. (After she has one of these Simanim, she is a Safek Bogeres. She is not Vadai until she has all of them.)</p>
<p class="bas indent2"><span class="nm">1.</span>Rav Papa or R. Chinena brei d'Rav Ika taught that Rebbi gave this answer. The other of these two Amora'im taught that Rebbi said 'we are stringent like all of the opinions' regarding the following Mishnah about Ma'aser.</p>
<p class="bas indent1"><span class="nm">(c)</span><span class="cl">(Mishnah) Question:</span> What kinds of Chatzer are Kove'a (mid'Rabanan? One may eat Tevel casually, until it is brought into the house, or something else that is Kove'a, i.e. forbids eating it until tithing it.)</p>
<p class="bas indent1"><span class="nm">(d)</span><span class="cl">Answer #1 (R. Shimon):</span> A Chatzer Tzuris in which Kelim are guarded is Kove'a.</p>
<p class="bas indent2"><span class="nm">1.</span><span class="cl">Question:</span> What is a Chatzer Tzuris?</p>
<p class="bas indent2"><span class="nm">2.</span><span class="cl">Answer (Rabah bar bar Chanah):</span> In (the city) Tzur, a watchman sits at the entrance of the Chatzer.</p>
<p class="bas indent1"><span class="nm">(e)</span><span class="cl">Answer #2 (R. Akiva):</span> If everyone opens and locks it himself, it is not Kove'a.</p>
<p class="bas indent1"><span class="nm">(f)</span><span class="cl">Answer #3 (R. Nechemyah):</span> If people are not embarrassed to eat in it, it is Kove'a.</p>
<p class="bas indent1"><span class="nm">(g)</span><span class="cl">Answer #4 (R. Yosi):</span> If people enter, and no one asks them why they came, it is not Kove'a.</p>
<p class="bas indent1"><span class="nm">(h)</span><span class="cl">Answer #5 (R. Yehudah):</span> If one Chatzer is inside another, the inner one is Kove'a, and the outer one is not.</p>

<p class="bas indent1"><span class="nm">(j)</span><span class="cl">Answer (Rebbi):</span> We are stringent like all of these opinions. (Each is Kove'a.)</p>
<p class="bas subject"><span class="nm">4)</span>AILONIS AND SERIS</p>
<p class="bas indent1"><span class="nm">(a)</span><span class="cl">(Mishnah - Beis Hillel):</span> If a 20 year old girl did not grow two hairs, she must bring a proof that she is 20 (and has Simanei Ailonis), she is an Ailonis (a female who will never undergo normal female development). She is an adult, and she is exempt from Chalitzah and Yibum;</p>
<p class="bas indent2"><span class="nm">1.</span>If a 20 year old man did not grow two hairs, if we have proof that he is 20 (and has Simanei Seris), he is a Seris (he will never have normal male development). He is an adult, and he is exempt from Chalitzah and Yibum.</p>
<p class="bas indent1"><span class="nm">(b)</span>Beis Shamai say, the age to become a Vadai Ailonis or Seris is 18.</p>
<p class="bas indent1"><span class="nm">(c)</span>R. Eliezer says, a boy becomes a Vadai Seris at 20, and a girl becomes a Vadai Ailonis at 18. This is because girls normally bring Simanim earlier than boys.</p>
<p class="bas indent1"><span class="nm">(d)</span><span class="cl">(Gemara) Contradiction (Mishnah):</span> The law of a boy nine years old and a day is the same as that of a 20 year old who did not grow hairs.</p>
<p class="bas indent1"><span class="nm">(e)</span><span class="cl">Answer (Rav Shmuel bar Rav Yitzchak):</span> The Mishnah says that he is an adult Seris if he has Simanim that he is a Seris.</p>
<p class="bas indent1"><span class="nm">(f)</span><span class="cl">Support (Rava - Mishnah):</span> (We need proof that he is 20) and (that) he is a Seris.</p>
<p class="bas indent1"><span class="nm">(g)</span><span class="cl">Question:</span> If he does not have Simanim, until when is he considered a minor?</p>
<p class="bas indent1"><span class="nm">(h)</span><span class="cl">Answer (Beraisa - R. Chiya):</span> He is a minor until the majority of a normal lifetime (i.e. the start of his 36th year).</p>
<p class="bas indent1"><span class="nm">(i)</span>When people who had not yet brought Simanim would come in front of R. Chiya, if they were thin, he would tell them to become fatter. If they were fat, he would tell them to become thinner;</p>
<p class="bas indent2"><span class="nm">1.</span><span class="cl">(R. Chiya):</span> Sometimes obesity causes Simanim to come, and sometimes thinness does.</p>
<p class="bas indent1"><span class="nm">(j)</span><span class="cl">(Rav):</span> All years mentioned in this Perek must be (full,) from day to day.</p>
<p class="bas indent1"><span class="nm">(k)</span><span class="cl">(Ula):</span> If the Mishnah said that they must be full, they are full. If not, they need not be full. (One or 30 days suffice for the last year.)</p>
<p class="bas indent1"><span class="nm">(l)</span><span class="cl">Question #1:</span> According to Ula, we understand why sometimes the Mishnah says that full years are needed, and sometimes it does not;</p>
<p class="bas indent2"><span class="nm">1.</span>According to Rav, all of them should specify!</p>
<p class="bas indent1"><span class="nm">(m)</span><span class="cl">Question #2 (Beraisa - R. Yosi ben Kipar citing R. Eliezer):</span> Once 30 days of the 20th year pass, this is like 20 full years.</p>
<p class="bas indent2"><span class="nm">1.</span>Similarly, Rebbi ruled that 30 days of the 18th year is like 18 full years.</p>
<p class="bas indent2"><span class="nm">2.</span>We can explain the difference between Rebbi and R. Yosi. Rebbi ruled like Beis Shamai, and R. Yosi ruled like Beis Hillel. (Maharsha - alternatively, both are like R. Eliezer. Rebbi discusses a girl, and R. Yosi discusses a boy.)</p>
<p class="bas indent2"><span class="nm">3.</span>Both of them oppose Rav!</p>
<p class="bas indent1"><span class="nm">(n)</span><span class="cl">Answer:</span> Tana'im argue about whether 30 days is like a year;</p>
<p class="bas indent2"><span class="nm">1.</span><span class="cl">(Beraisa):</span> All of the following must be full years -- the years specified for (certain) Korbanos, the year in which one may redeem a house sold in a walled city, the two years one must wait before redeeming a field that he sold, the six years that an Eved Ivri serves, and the years of a boy or girl (this will be explained).</p>
<p class="bas indent2"><span class="nm">2.</span><span class="cl">Question:</span> What is the source for the years of Korbanos?</p>
<p class="bas indent2"><span class="nm">3.</span>Answer (Rav Acha bar Yakov):"Keves Ben <i>Shenaso</i>" teaches that it must be in <i>its</i> first year. (It need not be in the same calendar year, i.e. from Rosh Hashanah until Rosh Hashanah, as its birth.)</p>
<p class="bas indent2"><span class="nm">4.</span><span class="cl">Question:</span> What is the source for the year to redeem a house?</p>
<p class="bas indent2"><span class="nm">5.</span><span class="cl">Answer:</span> "Ad Tom Shenas <i>Mimkaro</i>" refers to the year of <i>its</i> sale.</p>
<p class="bas indent2"><span class="nm">6.</span><span class="cl">Question:</span> What is the source for the years before redeeming a field?</p>
<p class="bas indent2"><span class="nm">7.</span><span class="cl">Answer:</span> "B'Mispar <i>Shenei</i> <i>Sevu'os</i> Yimkar Lach" refers to all the harvests of the two years, even if there are three harvests.

<p class="bas indent2"><span class="nm">8.</span><span class="cl">Question:</span> What is the source for the six years of an Eved Ivri?</p>
<p class="bas indent2"><span class="nm">9.</span><span class="cl">Answer:</span> "Shesh Shanim Ya'avod uva'Shevi'is" teaches that he also works in the seventh (calendar) year (until the date of his sale, which was not Rosh Hashanah).</p>
