<p class="bas subject"><span class="nm">1)</span>SELLING <i>MA'ASER</i></p>
<p class="bas indent1"><span class="nm">(a)</span>Rav Shmuel bar Rav Yitzchak holds like Rava;</p>
<p class="bas indent2"><span class="nm">1.</span><span class="cl">Question (Rav Shmuel):</span> What is the source that Ma'aser Behemah of orphans may be sold normally?</p>
<p class="bas indent2"><span class="nm">2.</span><span class="cl">Answer - Question:</span> "Rak b'Chol Avas Nafshecha Tizbach v'Achalta Vasar (k'Birkas Hash-m Elokecha)" refers to something that is blessed (i.e. may be sold) only <i>after</i> Shechitah. What is it?</p>
<p class="bas indent3"><span class="nm">i.</span><span class="cl">Answer:</span> It refers to Ma'aser Behemah. (Surely, mid'Oraisa there is no distinction between orphans and adults. Rav Shmuel discusses orphans, for they may sell Ma'aser even mid'Rabanan.)</p>
<p class="bas indent1"><span class="nm">(b)</span><span class="cl">Question:</span> One who may sell Ma'aser Behemah b'Havla'ah (i.e. orphans according to Abaye, and even adults according to Rava), may he sell it b'Havla'ah with the bones? (Perhaps the ruse is evident, for the bones are worth very little.)</p>
<p class="bas indent1"><span class="nm">(c)</span><span class="cl">Answer #1 (R. Chiya or R. Shimon b'Rebbi):</span> It is permitted.</p>
<p class="bas indent1"><span class="nm">(d)</span><span class="cl">Answer #2 (The other of R. Chiya and R. Shimon b'Rebbi):</span> It is forbidden.</p>
<p class="bas indent1"><span class="nm">(e)</span><span class="cl">Resolution #1:</span> They do not argue. One forbids Havla'ah with bones of a small animal (they are useless). The other permits Havla'ah with bones of a large animal (they can be used to make Kelim).</p>
<p class="bas indent1"><span class="nm">(f)</span><span class="cl">Resolution #2:</span> They do not argue. Each discusses his own area;</p>
<p class="bas indent2"><span class="nm">1.</span>In the locale of the first opinion, bones were used to make Kelim. In the locale of the second opinion, they were not.</p>
<p class="bas indent1"><span class="nm">(g)</span><span class="cl">(Beraisa):</span> It says about Bechor "Lo Sifdeh." It may be sold (even) while alive;</p>
<p class="bas indent2"><span class="nm">1.</span>It says regarding Ma'aser Behemah "Lo Yiga'el." It may not be sold alive or slaughtered, Tam or Ba'al Mum.</p>
<p class="bas indent1"><span class="nm">(h)</span><span class="cl">Question:</span> What is the source of this? ("Geulah" does not connote selling)!</p>
<p class="bas indent1"><span class="nm">(i)</span><span class="cl">Answer (Rav Chinena and Rav Dimi):</span> It says "Lo Yiga'el" regarding Ma'aser Behemah and Cherem (a kind of Hekdesh that is given to Kohanim, and then it becomes Chulin). Just like Cherem may not be redeemed <i>or sold</i>, also Ma'aser.</p>
<p class="bas indent1"><span class="nm">(j)</span><span class="cl">Rav Nachman bar Yitzchak:</span> We must say that the Gezeirah Shavah is Mufneh (i.e. "Lo Yiga'el" is not used for another teaching and it is extra, to be expounded). If not, we could challenge this;</p>
<p class="bas indent2"><span class="nm">1.</span>We cannot learn Ma'aser from Cherem, for Cherem is more stringent than Ma'aser. Cherem can take effect on anything (even Hekdesh), whereas only Chulin (Rashi; Rashash - Tahor animals) can become Ma'aser.</p>
<p class="bas indent1"><span class="nm">(k)</span><span class="cl">Question:</span> Which "Lo Yiga'el" is extra?</p>
<p class="bas indent1"><span class="nm">(l)</span><span class="cl">Answer #1A:</span> "Lo Yiga'el" of Cherem is extra. Even without it, we would have learned from Ma'aser;</p>
<p class="bas indent2"><span class="nm">1.</span>Ma'aser is Kodesh, and it cannot be redeemed. The same applies to Cherem;</p>
<p class="bas indent2"><span class="nm">2.</span>Therefore, "Lo Yiga'el" of Cherem is extra, so we do not challenge the Gezeirah Shavah.</p>
<p class="bas indent1"><span class="nm">(m)</span><span class="cl">Rejection:</span> We cannot learn Cherem from Ma'aser, for Ma'aser has a stringency. Its Kedushah causes mistaken Hekdesh to take effect on the ninth and 11th animals (if they were called "10th," and the real 10th was not called "10th")!</p>
<p class="bas indent1"><span class="nm">(n)</span><span class="cl">Answer #1B:</span> "Lo Yiga'el" of Cherem is extra. We could have learned from Bechor:</p>
<p class="bas indent2"><span class="nm">1.</span>Bechor is Kodesh, and it cannot be redeemed. The same applies to Cherem.</p>
<p class="bas indent1"><span class="nm">(o)</span><span class="cl">Rejection:</span> We cannot learn Cherem from Bechor, for Bechor has a stringency. It is Kodesh from the moment it is born!</p>
<p class="bas indent1"><span class="nm">(p)</span><span class="cl">Answer #2:</span> "Lo Yiga'el" of Ma'aser is extra. We could have learned from a Gezeirah Shavah "Ha'avarah-Ha'avarah" from Bechor;</p>
<p class="bas indent2"><span class="nm">1.</span>Bechor is Kodesh, and it cannot be redeemed. The same applies to Ma'aser.</p>
<p class="bas indent1"><span class="nm">(q)</span><span class="cl">Question:</span> We cannot learn Ma'aser from Bechor, for Bechor is Kodesh from the moment it is born!</p>
<p class="bas indent1"><span class="nm">(r)</span><span class="cl">Answer:</span> "Ha'avarah" in the Parshah of Bechor is totally unnecessary, to teach that we do not challenge this Gezeirah Shavah.</p>
<p class="bas subject"><span class="nm">2)</span>OTHER WAYS TO LEARN</p>
<p class="bas indent1"><span class="nm">(a)</span><span class="cl">Suggestion:</span> We should learn that Bechor may not be sold from Cherem, from the Gezeirah Shavah "Lo Yiga'el-Lo Yiga'el"! (Even though it says "Lo Sifdeh" regarding Bechor, this is like "Lo Yiga'el," like we conclude below).</p>
<p class="bas indent1"><span class="nm">(b)</span><span class="cl">Rejection:</span> This Gezeirah Shavah is not Mufneh. "Lo Yiga'el" in Parshas Ma'aser is extra, but not in Parshas Bechor (and we can challenge it. Cherem is more stringent than Bechor, for it can take effect on anything.)</p>
<p class="bas indent1"><span class="nm">(c)</span><span class="cl">Question:</span> We say that "Lo Sifdeh" regarding Bechor forbids Pidyon (and the same applies to Ma'aser), making "Lo Yiga'el" regarding Ma'aser extra, to learn a Gezeirah Shavah from Cherem (to forbid selling, without challenging it);</p>
<p class="bas indent2"><span class="nm">1.</span>Why don't we say that "Lo Yiga'el" regarding Ma'aser forbids Pidyon (and the same applies to Bechor), making "Lo Sifdeh" regarding Bechor extra, to learn from Cherem!</p>
<p class="bas indent1"><span class="nm">(d)</span><span class="cl">Answer:</span> We learn "Ge'ulah" from "Ge'ulah," but not from Pediyah.</p>
<p class="bas indent1"><span class="nm">(e)</span><span class="cl">Question:</span> A Gezeirah Shavah may be learned from a different word!</p>
<p class="bas indent2"><span class="nm">1.</span><span class="cl">(Beraisa - Tana d'Vei R. Yishmael):</span> "V'Shav ha'Kohen-u'Va ha'Kohen" (is a Gezeirah Shavah. It) equates the law (of a house with Tzara'as) when the Kohen (first) returns with when he comes (back a week later).</p>
<p class="bas indent1"><span class="nm">(f)</span><span class="cl">Answer:</span> We may learn from a different word only if there is no word more similar to learn from.</p>
<p class="bas indent1"><span class="nm">(g)</span><span class="cl">Question:</span> We should learn that Bechor may not be sold from Ma'aser (which is learned from Cherem) from the Gezeirah Shavah "Ha'avarah-Ha'avarah"!</p>
<p class="bas indent1"><span class="nm">(h)</span><span class="cl">Answer:</span> "Cherem Hu" (teaches that one may not sell Cherem), but not Bechor.</p>
<p class="bas indent1"><span class="nm">(i)</span><span class="cl">Question:</span> Why don't we expound "Cherem Hu", but not Ma'aser?</p>
<p class="bas indent1"><span class="nm">(j)</span><span class="cl">Answer:</span> Regarding Ma'aser it says "Ge'ulah," just like regarding Cherem.</p>
<p class="bas indent1"><span class="nm">(k)</span><span class="cl">Answer #2 (to Question (1:k) - Rava):</span> "Lo Yiga'el" of Cherem is extra. It need not teach that Cherem cannot be redeemed! (Tosfos says that Rashi fixed the text to say that "Lo Yimacher" is extra.)</p>
<p class="bas indent2"><span class="nm">1.</span>If the Cherem was not yet given to Kohanim, it is Kodesh Kodoshim;</p>
<p class="bas indent2"><span class="nm">2.</span>Once it is given to Kohanim, it is Chulin - "Kol Cherem b'Yisrael Lecha Yihyeh"!</p>
<p class="bas bbbline">32b----------------------------------------32b</p>
<p class="bas indent2"><span class="nm">3.</span>Since we do not use it to teach about Cherem, we use it to teach about Ma'aser. (Since it already says "Lo Yiga'el" regarding Ma'aser, it comes to forbid selling it.)</p>
<p class="bas indent1"><span class="nm">(l)</span><span class="cl">Question:</span> Why don't we use it to teach about Bechor?</p>
<p class="bas indent1"><span class="nm">(m)</span><span class="cl">Answer:</span> We use it to teach about Ma'aser, for it says "Lo Yiga'el" regarding Ma'aser, just like regarding Cherem.</p>
<p class="bas indent1"><span class="nm">(n)</span><span class="cl">Answer #3 (Rav Ashi):</span> "Lo Yiga'el" regarding Ma'aser means "it will not be sold."</p>
<p class="bas indent1"><span class="nm">(o)</span><span class="cl">Support (Rav Ashi, for himself):</span> "(V'Lo Yemirenu... ) v'Hayah Hu u'Semuraso Yihyeh Kodesh Lo Yiga'el" - just like Temurah applies while it is alive, also "Lo Yiga'el";</p>
<p class="bas indent2"><span class="nm">1.</span><span class="cl">Inference:</span> Ge'ulah is forbidden while alive, but it is permitted after death.</p>
<p class="bas indent2"><span class="nm">2.</span>Ge'ulah cannot refer to Pidyon. This cannot be done after death, for Ha'amadah and Ha'arachah are required!</p>
<p class="bas indent2"><span class="nm">3.</span><span class="cl">Conclusion:</span> "Lo Yiga'el" must mean "it will not be sold."</p>
<p class="bas indent1"><span class="nm">(p)</span><span class="cl">Question:</span> This is like the opinion that Ha'amadah and Ha'arachah apply to Kodshei Mizbe'ach;</p>
<p class="bas indent2"><span class="nm">1.</span>According to the opinion that they do not apply, how can Rav Ashi learn?</p>
<p class="bas indent1"><span class="nm">(q)</span><span class="cl">Answer:</span> It is unreasonable that something cannot be redeemed while alive, but it can be redeemed after death.</p>
<p class="bas indent1"><span class="nm">(r)</span><span class="cl">Question:</span> It is reasonable! While it was alive, it is too Kadosh to be redeemed. After death, it has less Kedushah, so it can be redeemed!</p>
<p class="bas indent1"><span class="nm">(s)</span><span class="cl">Answer:</span> No. While it is alive, when its Kedushah is strong enough (in corresponding cases of most Kodshim, e.g. Pesulei ha'Mukdashim) to be Matpis Pidyono (to become Chulin, by transferring its Kedushah onto redemption money), nevertheless it (Ma'aser) cannot be redeemed;</p>
<p class="bas indent2"><span class="nm">1.</span>After death, its Kedushah is too weak to be Matpis Pidyono. All the more so it cannot be redeemed!</p>
<p class="bas indent2"><span class="nm">2.</span><span class="cl">Conclusion:</span> "Lo Yiga'el" must mean "it will not be sold."</p>
<p class="bas indent2"><span class="nm">3.</span><span class="cl">Question:</span> Why didn't the Torah explicitly say "Lo Yimacher"?</p>
<p class="bas indent2"><span class="nm">4.</span><span class="cl">Answer:</span> Had it said "Lo Yimacher," one might have thought that one may not sell it, for that is treating it like Chulin, but it may be redeemed, for the money becomes Hekdesh;</p>
<p class="bas indent3"><span class="nm">i.</span>Therefore, it says "Lo Yiga'el," to teach that it may not be sold or redeemed.</p>
<p class="bas subject"><span class="nm">3)</span>WHO MAY EAT <i>BECHOR</i>?</p>
<p class="bas indent1"><span class="nm">(a)</span><span class="cl">(Mishnah - Beis Shamai):</span> A Kohen may not invite a Yisrael to eat Bechor (a Ba'al Mum);</p>
<p class="bas indent1"><span class="nm">(b)</span>Beis Hillel permit inviting even a Nochri.</p>
<p class="bas indent1"><span class="nm">(c)</span><span class="cl">(Gemara):</span> Our Mishnah is like R. Akiva;</p>
<p class="bas indent2"><span class="nm">1.</span><span class="cl">(Beraisa - Beis Shamai):</span> Only Kohanim may be invited to eat Bechor;</p>
<p class="bas indent2"><span class="nm">2.</span>Beis Hillel permit inviting Yisraelim;</p>
<p class="bas indent2"><span class="nm">3.</span>R. Akiva permits even Nochrim.</p>
<p class="bas indent1"><span class="nm">(d)</span><span class="cl">Question:</span> What is Beis Shamai's reason?</p>
<p class="bas indent1"><span class="nm">(e)</span><span class="cl">Answer:</span> "U'Vesaram Yihyeh Lach (ka'Chazeh ha'Tenufah uch'Shok... )" - just like Chazeh v'Shok (the chest and thigh of Shelamim, which are Matnos Kehunah) are permitted to Kohanim and forbidden to Yisrael, also Bechor.</p>
