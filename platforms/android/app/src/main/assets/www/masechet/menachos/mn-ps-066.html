<div class="subject"><span class="nm">1)</span><p>WHEN WE START COUNTING THE OMER (cont.)</p></div>
<div class="indent1"><span class="nm">(a)</span><p><span class="cl">(Continuation of Beraisa #2 - R. Yehudah ben Beseira):</span> "Tispar Lach" teaches that the count depends on Beis Din;</p></div>
<div class="indent2"><span class="nm">1.</span><p>It cannot be the day after Shabbos, for everyone knows that himself, without Beis Din.</p></div>
<div class="indent2"><span class="nm">2.</span><p>(This is unlike R. Yehudah ben Beseira in Beraisa #1. Some delete 'ben Beseira' from the text; this teaching is of R. Yehudah. Others say that there were two Tana'im named R. Yehudah ben Beseira.)</p></div>
<div class="indent1"><span class="nm">(b)</span><p>R. Yosi says, "mi'Macharas ha'Shabbos" means the day after Yom Tov;</p></div>
<div class="indent2"><span class="nm">1.</span><p><span class="cl">Suggestion:</span> Perhaps it means after Shabbos Bereishis, i.e. Shabbos of Pesach!</p></div>
<div class="indent2"><span class="nm">2.</span><p><span class="cl">Rejection:</span> It says only "Shabbos", without specifying. This could be any Shabbos of the year!</p></div>
<div class="indent1"><span class="nm">(c)</span><p>Another proof is that it says "Shabbos" at the end (of the count), and at the beginning. Just like (Macharas) ha'Shabbos (the week) at the end is a Regel, and it is the start of a Regel, also (Macharas) ha'Shabbos at the beginning is a Regel, and at the start of a Regel.</p></div>
<div class="indent1"><span class="nm">(d)</span><p><span class="cl">Contradiction (R. Shimon ben Elazar):</span> It says "Sheshes Yamim Tochal Matzos", and it says "Shiv'as Yamim Matzos Tochelu"!</p></div>
<div class="indent1"><span class="nm">(e)</span><p><span class="cl">Resolution:</span> Matzah that may not be eaten for seven days (i.e. Chodosh, which is forbidden until the Omer is brought) may be eaten for six days. (This teaches that the Omer is brought on the second day of Pesach.)</p></div>
<div class="indent1"><span class="nm">(f)</span><p><span class="cl">Suggestion:</span> Perhaps "mi'Yom Havi'achem Tisperu" teaches that we reap and bring the Omer, and we may start counting any time afterwards!</p></div>
<div class="indent1"><span class="nm">(g)</span><p><span class="cl">Rejection:</span> "Me'Hachel Chermesh ba'Kamah Tachel Lispor" (you start counting from when you begin reaping the Omer).</p></div>
<div class="indent1"><span class="nm">(h)</span><p><span class="cl">Suggestion:</span> Perhaps this teaches that we reap and start counting (on the 16th), but we may offer the Omer whenever we want!</p></div>
<div class="indent1"><span class="nm">(i)</span><p><span class="cl">Rejection:</span> "Mi'Yom Havi'achem" teaches that we must offer it that day.</p></div>
<div class="indent1"><span class="nm">(j)</span><p><span class="cl">Suggestion:</span> Perhaps this teaches that we reap, count and bring the Omer during the day!</p></div>
<div class="indent1"><span class="nm">(k)</span><p><span class="cl">Rejection:</span> "Sheva Shabasos Temimos Tihyenah" - the weeks must be Temimos (complete), so we must start counting at night.</p></div>
<div class="indent1"><span class="nm">(l)</span><p><span class="cl">Suggestion:</span> Perhaps we reap, bring and count at night!</p></div>
<div class="indent1"><span class="nm">(m)</span><p><span class="cl">Rejection:</span> It says "mi'Yom Havi'achem."</p></div>
<div class="indent1"><span class="nm">(n)</span><p><span class="cl">Question:</span> How do we fulfill both verses?</p></div>
<div class="indent1"><span class="nm">(o)</span><p><span class="cl">Answer:</span> We reap and count at night, and we bring during the day.</p></div>
<div class="indent1"><span class="nm">(p)</span><p><span class="cl">(Rava):</span> One can challenge every Tana, except for the last two Tana'im of each Beraisa:</p></div>
<div class="indent2"><span class="nm">1.</span><p>We can challenge R. Yochanan ben Zakai. The verses he learns from are needed for Abaye's teaching.</p></div>
<div class="indent3"><span class="nm">i.</span><p><span class="cl">(Abaye):</span> It is a Mitzvah to count the days, and a Mitzvah to count the weeks.</p></div>
<div class="indent2"><span class="nm">2.</span><p>We can challenge R. Eliezer and R. Yehoshua. Granted, they prove that "Shabbos" refers to Yom Tov, but perhaps it refers to the last day of Pesach!</p></div>
<div class="indent2"><span class="nm">3.</span><p>We cannot challenge R. Yishmael or R. Yehudah ben Beseira (in Beraisa #1).</p></div>
<div class="indent2"><span class="nm">4.</span><p>We can challenge R. Yosi b'Rebbi Yehudah. Perhaps the Torah says that we count 50 days for seven full weeks, excluding the days from Pesach until the first Motzei Shabbos after Pesach!</p></div>
<div class="indent2"><span class="nm">5.</span><p>We can challenge R. Yehudah (ben Beseira, in Beraisa #2). Perhaps we count from the last day of Pesach!</p></div>
<div class="indent2"><span class="nm">6.</span><p>R. Yosi realized that his first proof could be challenged (it is R. Eliezer's proof), so he brought a second proof.</p></div>
<div class="indent1"><span class="nm">(q)</span><p><span class="cl">(Abaye):</span> It is a Mitzvah to count the days, and a Mitzvah to count the weeks.</p></div>
<div class="indent1"><span class="nm">(r)</span><p>Rabanan of Rav Ashi's academy counted the days and the weeks.</p></div>
<div class="indent1"><span class="nm">(s)</span><p>Ameimar counted the days, but not the weeks;</p></div>
<div class="indent2"><span class="nm">1.</span><p>He holds that there is no Mitzvah today. It is only a commemoration of the Mitzvah when the Mikdash stands, so it suffices to count the days.</p></div>
<div class="subject"><span class="nm">2)</span><p>PREPARING THE OMER</p></div>
<div class="indent1"><span class="nm">(a)</span><p><span class="cl">(Mishnah - R. Meir):</span> They reaped the Omer and put it in boxes. They brought it to the Azarah and singed it over fire, in order to fulfill the Mitzvah of Kali (roasted);</p></div>
<div class="indent1"><span class="nm">(b)</span><p>Chachamim say, they beat it with reeds and cabbage stalks (they are soft), in order not to mash it. It is put into an Aviv (a copper Kli) with holes, and it is roasted inside.</p></div>
<div class="indent1"><span class="nm">(c)</span><p>It was spread out in the Azarah to be exposed to the wind to dry out. It was ground in a bean grinder. It was sifted through 13 sifters. An Isaron was extracted;</p></div>
<div class="indent1"><span class="nm">(d)</span><p>The remainder is redeemed. It is exempt from Ma'aser, but Chalah must be separated (if one makes a dough from it);</p></div>
<div class="indent1"><span class="nm">(e)</span><p>R. Akiva says, Chalah and Ma'aser must be taken.</p></div>
<div class="indent1"><span class="nm">(f)</span><p><span class="cl">(Gemara - Beraisa - R. Meir):</span> "Aviv" is the first harvest;</p></div>
<div class="indent1"><span class="nm">(g)</span><p>"Kaluy ba'Esh" - Yisrael singe it in fire; in order to fulfill the Mitzvah of Kali;</p></div>
<div class="indent1"><span class="nm">(h)</span><p>Chachamim say, if it was singed in fire it would not be called Kali. Kali is something roasted in Kalil (a copper Kli);</p></div>
<div class="bbbline">66b----------------------------------------66b</p></div>
<div class="indent2"><span class="nm">1.</span><p>There was a pipe used by sellers of parched grain. It had many holes, like a sifter, to allow heat of the fire to enter everywhere.</p></div>
<div class="indent1"><span class="nm">(i)</span><p><span class="cl">Question:</span> "Aviv Kaluy...Geres" - is it Kaluy (parched) when it is still Aviv (before it is ground), or when it is Geres (flour)?</p></div>
<div class="indent1"><span class="nm">(j)</span><p><span class="cl">Answer:</span> "Ba'Esh" separates between Kaluy and Geres, to teach that Kaluy refers to Aviv.</p></div>
<div class="indent1"><span class="nm">(k)</span><p>"Karmel" is Rach (soft; we transpose the letters of 'Kar' to spell 'Rach') and Mal (it can be beaten by hand).</p></div>
<div class="indent1"><span class="nm">(l)</span><p><span class="cl">Support:</span> Similarly, other verses are expounded like acronyms:</p></div>
<div class="indent2"><span class="nm">1.</span><p>"V'Ish Ba... Lechem Bikurim Lechem Se'orim v'Charmel B'TZiKLoNO va'Yomer Ten la'Am v'Yochelu" - Ba v'YaTZaK L*anu v'Achalnu v'NaVeh Havah (he came and poured for us, and we ate; it was nice);</p></div>
<div class="indent2"><span class="nm">2.</span><p>"NiS'ALSaH ba'Ahavim" - Nisa v'NiTen v'NALeh v'NiSmach v'Nischatei ba'AHavim" - an adultress entices 'let us talk, and go up (to the bed); we will rejoice and stroll in love.'</p></div>
<div class="indent2"><span class="nm">3.</span><p>"Kenaf Renanim Ne'ELasaH" - Nosei OLeh v'NisCHatei - the Bar Yuchni (a large bird) goes up and gently lays its egg down into its nest.</p></div>
<div class="indent2"><span class="nm">4.</span><p>"Ki YaRaT ha'Derech l'Negdi" - Yar'asah, Ra'asah, NaTsah (Bilam's donkey feared, saw and turned).</p></div>
<div class="indent2"><span class="nm">5.</span><p><span class="cl">(Tana d'Vei R. Yishmael):</span> "CHaRMeL" - Ka*R MaLei (like a full pillow, e.g. stuffed with feathers.)</p></div>
<div class="subject"><span class="nm">3)</span><p>MIRU'ACH OF HEKDESH</p></div>
<div class="indent1"><span class="nm">(a)</span><p><span class="cl">(Mishnah - R. Akiva):</span> Chalah and Ma'aser must be taken.</p></div>
<div class="indent1"><span class="nm">(b)</span><p><span class="cl">(Rav Kahana):</span> R. Akiva says that (in general) Miru'ach (final processing) of Hekdesh does not exempt from Ma'aser.</p></div>
<div class="indent1"><span class="nm">(c)</span><p><span class="cl">Question (Rav Sheshes - Beraisa) Question:</span> What was done with the rest of the three Sa'im reaped (after an Isaron for the Omer was extracted?)</p></div>
<div class="indent2"><span class="nm">1.</span><p><span class="cl">Answer:</span> It was redeemed. Anyone could eat it. It is exempt from Ma'aser. Chalah must be separated;</p></div>
<div class="indent2"><span class="nm">2.</span><p>R. Akiva says, Chalah and Ma'aser must be taken.</p></div>
<div class="indent2"><span class="nm">3.</span><p><span class="cl">Chachamim:</span> This is like a normal case of grain redeemed from Hekdesh. It is exempt from Ma'aser, but Chalah must be separated.</p></div>
<div class="indent3"><span class="nm">i.</span><p><span class="cl">Summation of question:</span> If Chachamim tried to bring a proof against R. Akiva from a normal case, surely R. Akiva agrees that Miru'ach of Hekdesh exempts!</p></div>
<div class="indent1"><span class="nm">(d)</span><p><span class="cl">Answer:</span> Chachamim thought that he agrees. He answered that he argues also about this.</p></div>
<div class="indent1"><span class="nm">(e)</span><p><span class="cl">Question (Rav Kahana bar Tachlifa - Beraisa - R. Akiva):</span> Chalah and Ma'aser must be taken, because Hekdesh buys (with Shekalim of Terumas ha'Lishkah) only what is needed. (The rest was never Hekdesh. Rav Kahana is refuted.):</p></div>
<div class="indent1"><span class="nm">(f)</span><p><span class="cl">(R. Yochanan):</span> (Really, R. Akiva holds that Miru'ach of Hekdesh exempts. In the Mishnah) he is Mechayev because Hekdesh buys only what is needed.</p></div>
<div class="indent1"><span class="nm">(g)</span><p><span class="cl">(Rava):</span> Surely, Miru'ach of Hekdesh exempts;</p></div>
<div class="indent2"><span class="nm">1.</span><p>Even R. Akiva is Mechayev only because Hekdesh buys only what is needed. He agrees that what was truly Hekdesh (at the time of Miru'ach) is exempt.</p></div>
<div class="indent1"><span class="nm">(h)</span><p><span class="cl">(Rava):</span> Tana'im argue about Miru'ach of a Nochri:</p></div>
<div class="indent2"><span class="nm">1.</span><p><span class="cl">(Beraisa - R. Meir and R. Yehudah):</span> We may be Torem produce of a Yisrael (make it Terumah) on (i.e. to exempt) produce of a Yisrael. We may be Torem produce of Nochrim on that of Nochrim, or of Kusim (questionable converts, they are considered like Nochrim) on that of Kusim. We may be Torem anyone's produce on anyone else's;</p></div>
<div class="indent2"><span class="nm">2.</span><p>R. Yosi and R. Shimon say, we may be Torem from Yisrael on Yisrael, from Nochri on Kusi or vice-versa, but we may not Torem from Yisrael on Nochri or Kusi or vice-versa.</p></div>
