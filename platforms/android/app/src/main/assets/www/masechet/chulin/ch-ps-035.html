<p class="dedicationbox">CHULIN 31-43 - Two weeks of study material have been dedicated by Mrs. Estanne Abraham Fawer to honor the Yahrzeit of her father, Rav Mordechai ben Eliezer Zvi (Rabbi Morton Weiner) Z'L, who passed away on 18 Teves 5760. May the merit of supporting and advancing Dafyomi study -- which was so important to him -- during the weeks of his Yahrzeit serve as an Iluy for his Neshamah. </p>

<div class="subject"><span class="nm">1)</span><p>CHULIN TREATED LIKE TERUMAH OR KODESH</p></div>
<div class="indent1"><span class="nm">(a)</span><p><span class="cl">(R. Yonason):</span> If one eats Terumah that is a Shelishi, he becomes disqualified to eat Terumah, but may touch it.</p></div>
<div class="indent1"><span class="nm">(b)</span><p>We need to hear both laws (Ula's and R. Yonason's);</p></div>
<div class="indent2"><span class="nm">1.</span><p>Had we heard only Ula's law, one might have thought that one who eats a Shelishi of Chulin Al Taharas Terumah becomes disqualified to eat Terumah, but he may touch it, but one who eats a Shelishi of Terumah may not even touch Terumah;</p></div>
<div class="indent2"><span class="nm">2.</span><p>Had we heard only R. Yonason's law, one might have thought that one who eats a Shelishi of Terumah is disqualified to eat Terumah, but one who eats such Chulin Al Taharas Terumah may eat it.</p></div>
<div class="indent1"><span class="nm">(c)</span><p><span class="cl">(R. Yitzchak bar Shmuel bar Marsa):</span> One who ate a Shelishi of Chulin Al Taharas Kodesh, may eat Kodesh, for a Revi'i (fourth-degree) l'Tumah of Kodesh can only come from a Shelishi of Kodesh.</p></div>
<div class="indent1"><span class="nm">(d)</span><p><span class="cl">Question (Rami bar Chama - Mishnah):</span> If one eats a Shelishi of Chulin Al Taharas Terumah, he becomes a Sheni regarding Kodesh, but not regarding Terumah.</p></div>
<div class="indent2"><span class="nm">1.</span><p>Even though this Shelishi is not Kodesh, it disqualifies (a person regarding) Kodesh!</p></div>
<div class="indent1"><span class="nm">(e)</span><p><span class="cl">Answer (R. Yitzchak):</span> That is because Terumah, even Tehorah, is considered Tamei regarding Kodesh!</p></div>
<div class="indent2"><span class="nm">1.</span><p><span class="cl">(Mishnah):</span> The clothes of a ignoramus are Metamei a Parush (one who eats Chulin in Taharah). The clothes of a Parush are Metamei one who eats Terumah. The clothes of one who eats Terumah are Metamei one who eats Kodesh.</p></div>
<div class="indent1"><span class="nm">(f)</span><p><span class="cl">Objection (Rava):</span> One cannot bring a proof from clothing. There, we are considered lest his wife sat on his clothing when she was Nidah. We have no such concern about Peros!</p></div>
<div class="bbbline">35b----------------------------------------35b</p></div>
<div class="indent1"><span class="nm">(g)</span><p>R. Yitzchak holds that the same stringencies apply to Peros.</p></div>
<div class="indent1"><span class="nm">(h)</span><p><span class="cl">Question (R. Yirmeyah mi'Difti):</span> We do not have such stringencies about Peros!</p></div>
<div class="indent2"><span class="nm">1.</span><p><span class="cl">(Mishnah):</span> If an ignoramus says 'I put a Revi'is of Kodesh in this Kli', he is believed also about Terumah in the Kli (that it is Tahor).</p></div>
<div class="indent2"><span class="nm">2.</span><p>We do not say that the ignoramus' Terumah is considered Tamei, and it makes the Kodesh Tamei. This refutes R. Yitzchak!</p></div>
<div class="indent1"><span class="nm">(i)</span><p><span class="cl">Answer (R. Yitzchak):</span> The law is different when both are in the same Kli. Since he is believed about the Kodesh, he is believed also about the Terumah.</p></div>
<div class="indent1"><span class="nm">(j)</span><p><span class="cl">Question (Rav Huna bar Noson - Mishnah):</span> A Sheni of Chulin is Metamei Chulin liquids (makes them a Rishon), and is Posel Terumah foods (solids). A Shelishi (of Chulin Al Taharas Kodesh) is Metamei liquids of Kodesh, and is Posel Kodesh foods.</p></div>
<div class="indent1"><span class="nm">(k)</span><p><span class="cl">Answer:</span> Tana'im argue about R. Yitzchak's law. (He holds like Chachamim);</p></div>
<div class="indent2"><span class="nm">1.</span><p><span class="cl">(Beraisa):</span> Chulin Al Taharas Kodesh is like regular Chulin;</p></div>
<div class="indent2"><span class="nm">2.</span><p>R. Eliezer b'Rebbi Tzadok says, it is like Terumah. It is Metamei two Kodesh foods (i.e. if it touched one, and that food touched a second Kodesh food), and is Posel a third (if the second food touches a third).</p></div>
<div class="subject"><span class="nm">2)</span><p>IS BLOOD MACHSHIR?</p></div>
<div class="indent1"><span class="nm">(a)</span><p><span class="cl">(Mishnah - R. Shimon):</span> The meat is Huchshar due to the Shechitah.</p></div>
<div class="indent1"><span class="nm">(b)</span><p><span class="cl">(Rav Asi):</span> R. Shimon holds that Shechitah is Machshir, but blood is not.</p></div>
<div class="indent1"><span class="nm">(c)</span><p><span class="cl">Suggestion:</span> The Mishnah supports Rav Asi.</p></div>
<div class="indent2"><span class="nm">1.</span><p><span class="cl">(Mishnah - R. Shimon):</span> The meat is Huchshar due to the Shechitah.</p></div>
<div class="indent2"><span class="nm">2.</span><p><span class="cl">(Inference:</span> Shechitah is Machshir the meat, but blood would not be.</p></div>
<div class="indent1"><span class="nm">(d)</span><p><span class="cl">Rejection:</span> No. He means that even Shechitah can be Machshir the meat.</p></div>
<div class="indent1"><span class="nm">(e)</span><p><span class="cl">Support (for Rav Asi - Beraisa - R. Shimon to Chachamim):</span> Blood is not Machshir. Shechitah is Machshir!</p></div>
<div class="indent1"><span class="nm">(f)</span><p><span class="cl">Rejection:</span> He means that not only blood is Machshir, rather, also Shechitah is!</p></div>
<div class="indent1"><span class="nm">(g)</span><p><span class="cl">(Beraisa - R. Shimon):</span> Blood of a dead animal (Rashi; Tosfos - person) is not Machshir.</p></div>
<div class="indent2"><span class="nm">1.</span><p><span class="cl">Inference:</span> Blood of Shechitah is Machshir!</p></div>
<div class="indent2"><span class="nm">2.</span><p><span class="cl">Rejection:</span> No, we infer that blood of a corpse (that was killed) is Machshir.</p></div>
<div class="indent2"><span class="nm">3.</span><p><span class="cl">Question:</span> If Dam Shechitah is not Machshir, the Beraisa should teach this, and we would know that all the more so, blood of a corpse is not Machshir!</p></div>
<div class="indent2"><span class="nm">4.</span><p><span class="cl">Answer:</span> It needed to teach about a corpse. If not, we might have thought that there is no difference whether it died naturally or was killed.</p></div>
<div class="indent1"><span class="nm">(h)</span><p><span class="cl">(Beraisa - R. Shimon):</span> Blood from a wound (Rashi - of an animal; Tosfos - of a person) is not Machshir.</p></div>
<div class="indent2"><span class="nm">1.</span><p><span class="cl">Inference:</span> Dam Shechitah is Machshir!</p></div>
<div class="indent2"><span class="nm">2.</span><p><span class="cl">Rejection:</span> No. Rather, we infer that blood of a corpse (that was killed) is Machshir.</p></div>
<div class="indent2"><span class="nm">3.</span><p><span class="cl">Question:</span> If Dam Shechitah is not Machshir, the Beraisa should teach this, and all the more so blood of a wound is not Machshir!</p></div>
<div class="indent2"><span class="nm">4.</span><p><span class="cl">Answer:</span> It had to teach about a wound. If not, we might have thought that there is no difference if it died fully or partially (i.e. it was only wounded).</p></div>
<div class="indent1"><span class="nm">(i)</span><p><span class="cl">Question:</span> Why would R. Shimon say that blood of a corpse is Machshir, but not Dam Shechitah?</p></div>
<div class="indent2"><span class="nm">1.</span><p>Just like a verse considers blood of a corpse to be a drink - "he will drink the blood of corpses", also a verse considers Dam Shechitah to be a drink!</p></div>
<div class="indent3"><span class="nm">i.</span><p>"You will pour (the blood) on the ground like water" equates blood to water!</p></div>
<div class="indent1"><span class="nm">(j)</span><p><span class="cl">Answer:</span> No, that verse teaches that just like one may benefit from water, also from blood of blemished Korbanos;</p></div>
<div class="indent2"><span class="nm">1.</span><p>One might have thought that just like one may not shear or work with blemished Korbanos, also one may not benefit from their blood. The verse teaches that this is not so.</p></div>
