<p class="dedicationbox">KIDUSHIN 45 (24 Cheshvan) - dedicated by Dr. Moshe and Rivkie Snow in memory of Rivkie's father, the Manostrishtcher  Rebbe, Hagaon Rav Yitzchak Yoel ben Harav Gedaliah Aharon Rabinowitz Ztz"l, Rav of Kehilas Nachalas Yehoshua in Canarsie, NY.

<p class="bas subject"><span class="nm">1)</span>A GIRL WHO WAS MEKADESH HERSELF</p>
<p class="bas indent1"><span class="nm">(a)</span><span class="cl">Question (Rav Hamnuna - Beraisa):</span> A man cannot sell his daughter (to be a slave) to relatives;</p>
<p class="bas indent2"><span class="nm">1.</span>R. Eliezer says, he can;</p>
<p class="bas indent2"><span class="nm">2.</span>All agree that he can sell her even if she is a widow to a Kohen Gadol, or a divorcee or Chalutzah to a regular Kohen.</p>
<p class="bas indent2"><span class="nm">3.</span><span class="cl">Question:</span> In the case of a widow, who was Mekadesh her to her first husband?</p>
<p class="bas indent3"><span class="nm">i.</span>It cannot be her father, for one cannot sell his daughter after he was Mekadesh her!</p>
<p class="bas indent2"><span class="nm">4.</span><span class="cl">Answer:</span> Rather, she was Mekadesh herself, and she is considered a widow!</p>
<p class="bas indent1"><span class="nm">(b)</span><span class="cl">Answer (Rav Amram):</span> She became Mekudeshes through Yi'ud, according to Rebbi Yosi b'Rebbi Yehudah, who says that the money given to buy an Amah is not considered Kidushin money (so it is as if her father was not Mekadesh her).</p>
<p class="bas indent1"><span class="nm">(c)</span><span class="cl">(Rav Huna):</span> (If a minor was Mekadesh herself to Reuven without her father's knowledge, and Reuven died,) she may do Mi'un to uproot a Ma'amar, but she cannot do Mi'un to uproot the (Kidushin and the) fall to Yibum.</p>
<p class="bas indent1"><span class="nm">(d)</span>If a Yavam gave her a Ma'amar, she needs a Get, Chalitzah, and Mi'un.</p>
<p class="bas indent2"><span class="nm">1.</span>She needs a Get, lest her father consented to (the Ma'amar, i.e. Kidushin) of the Yavam;</p>
<p class="bas indent2"><span class="nm">2.</span>She needs Chalitzah, lest her father consented to the Kidushin to Reuven, but not with the Ma'amar;</p>
<p class="bas indent2"><span class="nm">3.</span>She needs Mi'un, lest the father was not pleased with either (but people will think that she was Mekudeshes to the Yavam, and if he tries to be Mekadesh her sister, nothing happens. We require Mi'un, so people will see that something is amiss, and will ask Chachamim).</p>
<p class="bas indent1"><span class="nm">(e)</span>If no Ma'amar was given, she only needs Chalitzah.</p>
<p class="bas indent1"><span class="nm">(f)</span><span class="cl">Suggestion:</span> She should need Mi'un, lest people think that the Yavam cannot Mekadesh her sister!</p>
<p class="bas indent1"><span class="nm">(g)</span><span class="cl">Rejection:</span> Everyone knows that the Isur to marry the sister of one's Chalutzah is only mid'Rabanan (and mid'Oraisa, she can be Mekudeshes to the Yavam).</p>
<p class="bas indent2"><span class="nm">1.</span><span class="cl">(Reish Lakish):</span> A Mishnah teaches that the Torah forbids marrying the sister of an ex-wife. Mid'Rabanan, one may not marry the sister of one's Chalutzah.</p>
<p class="bas subject"><span class="nm">2)</span>CONSENT OF THE FATHER</p>
<p class="bas indent1"><span class="nm">(a)</span>Reuven and Shimon were drinking beer. Reuven gave a cup to Shimon and said 'be Mekadesh your daughter to my son.'</p>
<p class="bas indent1"><span class="nm">(b)</span><span class="cl">(Ravina):</span> Even Rav and Shmuel, who are concerned lest a man consented to his daughter's Kidushin, are not concerned lest a man consented to his father's Kidushin.</p>
<p class="bas bbbline">45b----------------------------------------45b</p>
<p class="bas indent2"><span class="nm">1.</span><span class="cl">Rabanan:</span> Perhaps the son made his father a Shali'ach!</p>
<p class="bas indent2"><span class="nm">2.</span><span class="cl">Ravina:</span> He would not be so brazen to do so.</p>
<p class="bas indent2"><span class="nm">3.</span><span class="cl">Question:</span> Perhaps the son told the father that he wanted to be Mekadesh her!</p>
<p class="bas indent2"><span class="nm">4.</span><span class="cl">Answer (Rabah bar Simi):</span> Really, Rav and Shmuel would be concerned. Ravina explicitly said that he does not hold like Rav and Shmuel.</p>
<p class="bas indent1"><span class="nm">(c)</span>A man was Mekadesh a minor in the market with a bundle of vegetables.</p>
<p class="bas indent1"><span class="nm">(d)</span><span class="cl">(Ravina):</span> Even Rav and Shmuel are concerned only when the Kidushin was done honorably, but not when it was done disgracefully.</p>
<p class="bas indent1"><span class="nm">(e)</span><span class="cl">Question (Rav Acha of Difti):</span> Was the disgrace that he was Mekadesh in the market, or that he gave her vegetables?</p>
<p class="bas indent2"><span class="nm">1.</span>This will determine the law if he was Mekadesh with money in the market, or with vegetables in a house.</p>
<p class="bas indent1"><span class="nm">(f)</span><span class="cl">Answer (Ravina):</span> Each of these by itself is a disgrace.</p>
<p class="bas indent1"><span class="nm">(g)</span>A man was arguing with his wife if they would Mekadesh their daughter to his relative or to hers. After pressure, he consented that she marry his wife's relative. During the meal (to celebrate the Kidushin to her relative), his relative was Mekadesh her in another room.</p>
<p class="bas indent1"><span class="nm">(h)</span><span class="cl">(Abaye):</span> "Yisre'elim will not do unjustly or speak falsely" (surely, the father does not consent).</p>
<p class="bas indent1"><span class="nm">(i)</span><span class="cl">(Rava):</span> A man does not make a banquet for naught (if he would consent, the meal was for nothing).</p>
<p class="bas indent2"><span class="nm">1.</span>If he did not exert himself to make the meal, Rava would be concerned lest he agreed, but Abaye would not.</p>
<p class="bas subject"><span class="nm">3)</span>WHEN THE FATHER IS AWAY</p>
<p class="bas indent1"><span class="nm">(a)</span>A man agreed to his daughter's Kidushin (to a Kohen), and went abroad. She had Nisu'in.</p>
<p class="bas indent1"><span class="nm">(b)</span><span class="cl">(Rav):</span> She may eat Terumah. If the father returns and protests, she must stop eating.</p>
<p class="bas indent1"><span class="nm">(c)</span><span class="cl">(Rav Asi):</span> She may not eat Terumah, lest the father return and protest, for then retroactively, she was forbidden to eat!</p>
<p class="bas indent2"><span class="nm">1.</span>A case occurred, and Rav was concerned for Rav Asi's opinion, and was stringent.</p>
<p class="bas indent1"><span class="nm">(d)</span><span class="cl">(Rav Shmuel bar Rav Yitzchak):</span> Rav admits that if she dies before the father returns, her husband does not inherit her. We leave the money in its Chazakah (her father inherits her, perhaps the Nisu'in was invalid).</p>
<p class="bas indent1"><span class="nm">(e)</span>A man agreed to his daughter's Kidushin (to a Kohen). She had Nisu'in without consulting her father, who was around.</p>
<p class="bas indent1"><span class="nm">(f)</span><span class="cl">(Rav Huna):</span> She may not eat Terumah.</p>
<p class="bas indent1"><span class="nm">(g)</span><span class="cl">(R. Yirmiyah bar Aba):</span> She may eat Terumah.</p>
<p class="bas indent2"><span class="nm">1.</span>Rav Huna holds that even Rav would admit that she may not eat. Since the father was here, his silence shows that he is angry and does protests the Nisu'in.</p>
<p class="bas indent2"><span class="nm">2.</span>R. Yirmiyah holds that even Rav Asi would admit that she may eat. The father's silence shows that he accepts the Nisu'in.</p>
<p class="bas indent1"><span class="nm">(h)</span>A girl became Mekudeshes and had Nisu'in without consulting her father.</p>
<p class="bas indent1"><span class="nm">(i)</span><span class="cl">(Rav Huna):</span> She may eat Terumah.</p>
<p class="bas indent1"><span class="nm">(j)</span><span class="cl">(R. Yirmiyah bar Aba):</span> She may not eat Terumah.</p>
<p class="bas indent1"><span class="nm">(k)</span><span class="cl">Ula:</span> Seemingly, Rav Huna contradicts himself!</p>
<p class="bas indent2"><span class="nm">1.</span>When the father agreed to the Kidushin, she is certainly Mekudeshes mid'Oraisa, yet Rav Huna forbids her to eat. Here, all the more so she may not eat!</p>
<p class="bas indent2"><span class="nm">2.</span>R. Yirmiyah's opinion is better.</p>
<p class="bas indent1"><span class="nm">(l)</span><span class="cl">(Rava):</span> Rav Huna reason is, since she acted like an orphan in her father's lifetime (did everything herself) and he remained silent, this proves that he does not protest.</p>
