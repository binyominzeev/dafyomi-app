<div class="indent1"><span class="nm">(a)</span><p><span class="cl">Suggestion:</span> Tana'im argue about Ravina's law.</p></div>
<div class="indent2"><span class="nm">1.</span><p><span class="cl">(Beraisa - R. Eliezer):</span> If the Eimurim of Kodshim Kalim left the Azarah before Zerikah, one is not liable for them for the following - Me'ilah, Pigul, Nosar and Tamei;</p></div>
<div class="indent2"><span class="nm">2.</span><p>R. Akiva says, all of these apply to them.</p></div>
<div class="indent2"><span class="nm">3.</span><p><span class="cl">Suggestion:</span> They argue about Eimurim returned to the Azarah before Zerikah. R. Eliezer says that they were already Nifsalim through Yotzei, and R. Akiva says that they were not.</p></div>
<div class="indent1"><span class="nm">(b)</span><p><span class="cl">Rejection (Rav Papa):</span> No, if they were returned to the Azarah before Zerikah, all agree that Me'ilah, Pigul... apply to them. (Rambam (according to Kesef Mishnah) - they were not Nifsalim through Yotzei; Tosfos 26a - this is even though they were Nifsalim through Yotzei);</p></div>
<div class="indent2"><span class="nm">1.</span><p>They argue when the Eimurim were not returned to the Azarah before Zerikah. R. Eliezer says that Zerikah does not take effect on what is outside the Azarah, and R. Akiva says that it does.</p></div>
<div class="indent1"><span class="nm">(c)</span><p><span class="cl">Question:</span> Rav Papa himself said that R. Eliezer and R. Akiva agree that Zerikas Dam (of the Shalmei Tzibur brought with Shtei ha'Lechem) does not take effect on the Shtei ha'Lechem if they left the Azarah after Shechitah and are still outside at the time of Zerikah;</p></div>
<div class="indent2"><span class="nm">1.</span><p>He says that they argue when the Shtei ha'Lechem were returned to the Azarah before Zerikah!</p></div>
<div class="indent1"><span class="nm">(d)</span><p><span class="cl">Answer:</span> Shtei ha'Lechem are different. They are not part of the Shalmei Tzibur.</p></div>
<div class="indent2"><span class="nm">1.</span><p>Eimurim are part of a Zevach. The Tana'im argue about whether Zerikah affects Eimurim outside the Azarah.</p></div>
<div class="subject"><span class="nm">2)</span><p>PRECEDENCES AMONG <i>MENACHOS</i></p></div>
<div class="indent1"><span class="nm">(a)</span><p><span class="cl">(Mishnah):</span> Birds come before Menachos...</p></div>
<div class="indent1"><span class="nm">(b)</span><p><span class="cl">Question:</span> Menachos should come first, for also the Tzibur brings Menachos!</p></div>
<div class="indent1"><span class="nm">(c)</span><p><span class="cl">Answer:</span> The fact that birds have blood outweighs this.</p></div>
<div class="indent1"><span class="nm">(d)</span><p><span class="cl">(Mishnah):</span> Minchas Chotei comes before Minchas Nedavah...</p></div>
<div class="indent1"><span class="nm">(e)</span><p><span class="cl">Question:</span> Minchas Nedavah should come first, for it requires oil and frankincense!</p></div>
<div class="indent1"><span class="nm">(f)</span><p><span class="cl">Answer:</span> The fact that Minchas Chotei is brought due to a transgression outweighs this.</p></div>
<div class="indent1"><span class="nm">(g)</span><p><span class="cl">Question:</span> Which comes first, Minchas Sotah or Minchas Nedavah?</p></div>
<div class="indent2"><span class="nm">1.</span><p>Minchas Nedavah comes first, for it requires oil and frankincense;</p></div>
<div class="indent2"><span class="nm">2.</span><p>Or, Minchas Sotah comes first, for it clarifies whether or not she is guilty!</p></div>
<div class="indent1"><span class="nm">(h)</span><p><span class="cl">Answer #1 (Mishnah):</span> Minchas Chotei comes before Minchas Nedavah.</p></div>
<div class="indent2"><span class="nm">1.</span><p><span class="cl">Inference:</span> Minchas Chotei comes first (for it atones), but not Minchas Sotah.</p></div>
<div class="indent1"><span class="nm">(i)</span><p><span class="cl">Rejection:</span> The Mishnah does not say that it comes first because it atones, rather, because it comes due to transgression. The same applies to Minchas Sotah!</p></div>
<div class="indent1"><span class="nm">(j)</span><p><span class="cl">Answer #2 (Beraisa):</span> This (Minchah) comes before this, for the former is made from wheat, and the latter is from barley.</p></div>
<div class="indent2"><span class="nm">1.</span><p><span class="cl">Suggestion:</span> It means that Minchas Nedavah comes before Minchas Sotah (for the former is made from wheat, and the latter from barley.)</p></div>
<div class="indent1"><span class="nm">(k)</span><p><span class="cl">Rejection:</span> No, it means that Minchas Chotei comes before Minchas Sotah.</p></div>
<div class="indent1"><span class="nm">(l)</span><p><span class="cl">Question:</span> The Beraisa says that it comes first because wheat is more important than barley. Even without this, Minchas Chotei would come first, for it atones, and Minchas Sotah does not!</p></div>
<div class="indent2"><span class="nm">1.</span><p><span class="cl">Counter-question:</span> Also if the Beraisa teaches that Minchas Nedavah comes before Minchas Sotah, it should not attribute this to the grain used - Minchas Nedavah comes first because it has oil and frankincense!</p></div>
<div class="indent1"><span class="nm">(m)</span><p><span class="cl">Answer (to both questions):</span> Both are valid reasons why Minchas Sotah comes last. The Beraisa teaches only one of them.</p></div>
<div class="subject"><span class="nm">3)</span><p><i>CHATA'OS</i> COME BEFORE <i>OLOS</i></p></div>
<div class="indent1"><span class="nm">(a)</span><p><span class="cl">(Mishnah):</span> Chatas ha'Of comes before Olas ha'Of.</p></div>
<div class="indent1"><span class="nm">(b)</span><p><span class="cl">Question:</span> What is the source of this?</p></div>
<div class="indent1"><span class="nm">(c)</span><p><span class="cl">Answer (Beraisa) Question:</span> (When Chatas ha'Of and Olas ha'Of are brought for Oleh v'Yored,) it says "v'Hikriv Es Asher la'Chatas Rishonah." Why must the Torah say this?</p></div>
<div class="indent2"><span class="nm">1.</span><p>Another verse teaches "v'Es ha'Sheni Ya'aseh Olah"!</p></div>
<div class="indent2"><span class="nm">2.</span><p><span class="cl">Answer:</span> This is extra to teach, through Binyan Av, that whenever a Chatas and Olah are brought together, the Chatas comes first;</p></div>
<div class="indent2"><span class="nm">3.</span><p>This is true whether both are Behemos, or both birds, or (in the case of a rich Yoledes) Chatas ha'Of is brought with Olas Behemah.</p></div>
<div class="indent2"><span class="nm">4.</span><p>When both are birds, we learn from "v'Es ha'Sheni Ya'aseh Olah." When both are Behemos we learn from "la'Chatas Rishonah." Chatas ha'Of with Olas Behemah is learned from the Binyan Av.</p></div>
<div class="indent1"><span class="nm">(d)</span><p><span class="cl">Question (Beraisa - R. Eliezer):</span> Whenever birds (i.e. Chatas and Olah) are brought in place of Chatas Behemah, the Chatas is first;</p></div>
<div class="indent2"><span class="nm">1.</span><p>Regarding (the Korban of a poor) Yoledes, Olas ha'Of is in place of Olas Behemah, so the Olah is first.</p></div>
<div class="indent2"><span class="nm">2.</span><p>Whenever birds are brought due to Chet, the Chatas is first;</p></div>
<div class="indent2"><span class="nm">3.</span><p>Korban Yoledes is not due to Chet, so the Olah is first.</p></div>
<div class="indent2"><span class="nm">4.</span><p>Whenever both birds are in place of Chatas Behemah, the Chatas is first;</p></div>
<div class="indent2"><span class="nm">5.</span><p>Chatas ha'Of of a Yoledes is not in place of a Behemah (no Yoledes brings Chatas Behemah), so the Olah is first.</p></div>
<div class="indent1"><span class="nm">(e)</span><p><span class="cl">Answer (Rava):</span> R. Eliezer explains that regarding Yoledes, the Torah puts the Olah first only for Mikra'ah (Rashi - the order in which the Torah mentions them; R. Chayim (in Tosfos) - the order in which one must be Makdish them), but the Chatas is offered first (Shitah Mekubetzes - if if both are in front of us; if she only has one bird now, she may offer it for the Olah and bring the Chatas when she finds another).</p></div>
<div class="indent1"><span class="nm">(f)</span><p><span class="cl">Question (Beraisa):</span> Bulls come before rams, rams come before lambs, and lambs come before goats.</p></div>
<div class="bbbline">90b----------------------------------------90b</p></div>
<div class="indent2"><span class="nm">1.</span><p><span class="cl">Suggestion:</span> This refers to the Musafim brought on Sukos. (Even though the goat is a Chatas, the other animals (all Olos) come before it!)</p></div>
<div class="indent1"><span class="nm">(g)</span><p><span class="cl">Answer #1:</span> No, it refers to Nedavos:</p></div>
<div class="indent2"><span class="nm">1.</span><p>Bulls come before rams, because they are accompanied by bigger Nesachim (a Minchah of three Esronim and six Lugim of wine);</p></div>
<div class="indent2"><span class="nm">2.</span><p>For the same reason, rams (accompanied by two Esronim and four Lugim) come before lambs (one Isaron and three Lugim);</p></div>
<div class="indent2"><span class="nm">3.</span><p>Lambs come before goats, for a lamb's tail is part of the Eimurim, but a goat's tail is not.</p></div>
<div class="indent1"><span class="nm">(h)</span><p><span class="cl">Question (Beraisa):</span> If the Par of the Kohen Gadol and the Par of the Tzibur are waiting to be offered, the Kohen Gadol offers his Par first (because he atones, and the Tzibur gets Kaparah);</p></div>
<div class="indent2"><span class="nm">1.</span><p>A Par (of the Tzibur) for a transgression (other than idolatry) comes before the Par for idolatry;</p></div>
<div class="indent2"><span class="nm">2.</span><p>The Par for idolatry precedes the Sa'ir for idolatry, even though the Par is an Olah and the Sa'ir is a Chatas!</p></div>
<div class="indent2"><span class="nm">3.</span><p><span class="cl">Question:</span> (How can we ask from the Seifa of this Beraisa?) The Reisha teaches that a Chatas comes first!</p></div>
<div class="indent3"><span class="nm">i.</span><p><span class="cl">(Reisha):</span> A Par (not for idolatry) comes before the Par for idolatry;</p></div>
<div class="indent2"><span class="nm">4.</span><p><span class="cl">Answer:</span> The one who asked (Question (h)) agrees that a Chatas precedes an Olah of the same species. He brought the Seifa to prove that an Olah of a higher (priority) species comes before a Chatas.</p></div>
<div class="indent1"><span class="nm">(i)</span><p><span class="cl">Answer #1 (Chachamim of Eretz Yisrael):</span> The Torah omitted the 'Aleph' from the word 'Chatas' regarding the Chatas brought for Helam Davar of idolatry, to teach that it lacks its usual precedence, the Olah precedes it.</p></div>
<div class="indent1"><span class="nm">(j)</span><p><span class="cl">Answer #2 (Ravina):</span> It says "ka'Mishpat" (in the order in which they are written, the Olah is first).</p></div>
<div class="indent1"><span class="nm">(k)</span><p>This suggests another answer to Question (f);</p></div>
<div class="indent2"><span class="nm">1.</span><p><span class="cl">Answer #2:</span> Indeed, the Beraisa refers to Musafim of Sukos. Since it says "ka'Mishpatam", they are offered in the order in which they are written.</p></div>
<div class="indent1"><span class="nm">(l)</span><p><span class="cl">Question:</span> If Chatas ha'Of, Olas Behemah and Ma'aser are all waiting to be offered, which comes first?</p></div>
<div class="indent2"><span class="nm">1.</span><p>Chatas ha'Of cannot be first, for Ma'aser precedes it!</p></div>
<div class="indent2"><span class="nm">2.</span><p>Ma'aser cannot be first, for Olah precedes it!</p></div>
<div class="indent2"><span class="nm">3.</span><p>Olah cannot be first, for Chatas ha'Of precedes it!</p></div>
<div class="indent1"><span class="nm">(m)</span><p><span class="cl">Answer #1 (Chachamim of Bavel):</span> A Zevach has precedence (therefore, Ma'aser must come before Chatas ha'Of. The Olah must come after the Chatas).</p></div>
<div class="indent1"><span class="nm">(n)</span><p><span class="cl">Answer #2 (Chachamim of Eretz Yisrael):</span> Since the Chatas ha'Of comes with and precedes the Olah, it receives the importance of the Olah, hence it precedes also Ma'aser.</p></div>
<div class="subject"><span class="nm">4)</span><p>PRECEDENCE AMONG <i>KORBANOS</i></p></div>
<div class="indent1"><span class="nm">(a)</span><p><span class="cl">(Mishnah):</span> Chatas always precedes Asham, except for Asham Metzora, which is Machshir (the Metzora for Kodshim);</p></div>
<div class="indent1"><span class="nm">(b)</span><p>Every Asham must be a second year animal, and it must be bought for at least two Shekalim, except for Asham Nazir and Asham Metzora. They are first year animals, and they need not cost two Shekalim.</p></div>
<div class="indent1"><span class="nm">(c)</span><p>The precedence to eat them is the same as the precedence to offer them.</p></div>
<div class="indent1"><span class="nm">(d)</span><p>A Shelamim of (i.e. it was brought to the Azarah) yesterday comes (is offered) before a Shelamim of today (it is a disgrace to delay it so long);</p></div>
<div class="indent1"><span class="nm">(e)</span><p>R. Meir says, a Shelamim of yesterday comes before a Chatas or Asham of today; (Tosfos - the Shelamim may be eaten only until nightfall, but the Chatas or Asham is permitted also at night.)</p></div>
<div class="indent1"><span class="nm">(f)</span><p>Chachamim say, the Chatas or Asham comes first, for it is Kodshei Kodoshim.</p></div>
<div class="indent1"><span class="nm">(g)</span><p>Kohanim may eat any Kodshim any way they want, roasted, overcooked or cooked;</p></div>
<div class="indent1"><span class="nm">(h)</span><p>R. Shimon says, they may cook it with Terumah spices;</p></div>
<div class="indent1"><span class="nm">(i)</span><p>R. Meir forbids this, lest the Terumah become wasted (it cannot be eaten after the Kodshim becomes Nosar, for it absorbs the taste of Kodshim).</p></div>
<div class="indent1"><span class="nm">(j)</span><p><span class="cl">(Gemara) Question:</span> Which takes precedence, what is more Tadir, or what is more Kadosh?</p></div>
<div class="indent1"><span class="nm">(k)</span><p><span class="cl">Answer #1 (Mishnah):</span> Temidim come before Musafim.</p></div>
<div class="indent2"><span class="nm">1.</span><p>Even though Musafim are more Kadosh, Temidim come first, for they are more Tadir.</p></div>
