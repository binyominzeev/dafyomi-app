<div class="subject"><span class="nm">1)</span><p>HEFSHET AND NITUACH BY A ZAR (cont'd)</p></div>
<div class="indent1"><span class="nm">(a)</span><p><span class="cl">Question:</span> But that reference to the Kohanim is not superfluous!?</p></div>
<div class="indent1"><span class="nm">(b)</span><p><span class="cl">Answer (R. Shimi b. Ashi, citing Abaye, who was teaching this Derashah to his sons):</span> This is how Chizkiyah is to be understood.</p></div>
<div class="indent2"><span class="nm">1.</span><p>First he taught the Beraisa which teaches the Shechitah can be done by a Zar.</p></div>
<div class="indent2"><span class="nm">2.</span><p>This is learned from the reference to Kohanim by Kabalas Dam, and not by Shechitah, demonstrating that only from Kabalah onward requires a Kohen, whereas the owner who is Somech may also be Shochet.</p></div>
<div class="indent2"><span class="nm">3.</span><p>If, Abaye went on to explain, Kabalah and forward is the Mitzvah of Kohanim, then why are we taught that they must place the fire on the Korban?</p></div>
<div class="indent2"><span class="nm">4.</span><p>It must be to permit Hefshet and Nituach by a Zar.</p></div>
<div class="indent1"><span class="nm">(c)</span><p><span class="cl">Question:</span> But, still, we would need to be taught that the Kohen must place the fire (even though it is after Kabalah)?</p></div>
<div class="indent2"><span class="nm">1.</span><p>Since the fire is not Me'akev Kaparah, it might not need a Kohen.</p></div>
<div class="indent2"><span class="nm">2.</span><p>And, as it teaches us this Din, we cannot make other inferences from this P'sul to Hefshet and Nituach.</p></div>
<div class="indent1"><span class="nm">(d)</span><p><span class="cl">Answer:</span> The source is "ve'Archu ...ha'Kohanim ... ".</p></div>
<div class="indent2"><span class="nm">1.</span><p>Since from Kabalah onward is known as the realm of the Kohanim, why do I need this Pasuk?</p></div>
<div class="indent2"><span class="nm">2.</span><p>It must exclude Hefshet and Nituach.</p></div>
<div class="indent1"><span class="nm">(e)</span><p><span class="cl">Question:</span> But perhaps this Pasuk excludes Sidur Eitzim?</p></div>
<div class="indent1"><span class="nm">(f)</span><p><span class="cl">Answer:</span> It more likely excludes a similar Avodah (done on the animal itself, unlike the Sidur Eitzim).</p></div>
<div class="indent2"><span class="nm">1.</span><p><span class="cl">Question:</span> To the contrary, Sidur Eitzim is more likely excluded, since they both involve arrangements of the fire!</p></div>
<div class="indent2"><span class="nm">2.</span><p><span class="cl">Answer:</span> We really would not have thought that Sidur Eitzim does not require a Kohen, once the Pasuk excludes <i>bringing</i> the Eitzim.</p></div>
<div class="indent2"><span class="nm">3.</span><p>Thus, "ve'Archu" must exclude Hefshet and Nituach.</p></div>
<div class="indent1"><span class="nm">(g)</span><p><span class="cl">Question:</span> Then what is the purpose of "ve'Hiktir ha'Kohen" (who would have thought that Haktarah does not require a Kohen)?</p></div>
<div class="indent1"><span class="nm">(h)</span><p><span class="cl">Answer:</span> Indeed, "ve'Hiktir" is that which excludes Hefshet and Nituach.</p></div>
<div class="subject"><span class="nm">2)</span><p>OTHER PESUKIM WHICH SPEAK OF KOHANIM AFTER KABALAH</p></div>
<div class="indent1"><span class="nm">(a)</span><p>The Pasuk teaches that bringing the Eivarim to the Kevesh requires a Kohen, but not bringing the Eitzim (and, by inference, the Sidur Eitzim does require a Kohen).</p></div>
<div class="indent1"><span class="nm">(b)</span><p>"ve'Nasnu" teaches its own requirement (since it is not Me'akev the Kaparah).</p></div>
<div class="indent1"><span class="nm">(c)</span><p>We may derive from the Pasuk "ve'Archu" that a T'le requires six Kohanim.</p></div>
<div class="indent1"><span class="nm">(d)</span><p><span class="cl">Question:</span> There is a challenge to R. Elazar since the Pasuk of "ve'Archu" speaks of a Ben Bakar, which requires 24 Kohanim!</p></div>
<div class="indent1"><span class="nm">(e)</span><p><span class="cl">Answer:</span> The end of the Pasuk (speaking of Eitzim) teaches that the six Kohanim are not dealing with the Ben Bakar, but with the T'le, about which the Torah requires that Eitzim be prepared each morning.</p></div>

<div class="subject"><span class="nm">3)</span><p>A ZAR AND SIDUR EITZIM</p></div>
<div class="indent1"><span class="nm">(a)</span><p><span class="cl">(Rav):</span> A Zar who does Sidur Eitzim on the Ma'arachah is Chayav Misah.</p></div>
<div class="indent1"><span class="nm">(b)</span><p><span class="cl">Question:</span> What can be done to repair such a Ma'arachah.</p></div>
<div class="indent1"><span class="nm">(c)</span><p><span class="cl">Answer:</span> He takes it apart and puts it back together.</p></div>
<div class="indent1"><span class="nm">(d)</span><p><span class="cl">Question:</span> How will that help if the Zar puts it back?</p></div>
<div class="indent1"><span class="nm">(e)</span><p><span class="cl">Answer:</span> The Zar dismantles it and the Kohen rearranges it.</p></div>
<div class="indent1"><span class="nm">(f)</span><p><span class="cl">Question (R. Zeira):</span> How could an Avodah of the night (such as Sidur ha'Ma'arachah) be forbidden to a Zar!?</p></div>
<div class="indent1"><span class="nm">(g)</span><p><span class="cl">Answer:</span> Yes, witness the Eivarim and Pedarim (Kosher all night yet forbidden to a Zar)!</p></div>
<div class="indent1"><span class="nm">(h)</span><p><span class="cl">Question:</span> But these are the end of the <i>day's</i> Avodah.</p></div>
<div class="indent1"><span class="nm">(i)</span><p><span class="cl">Answer:</span> Yes, but witness the Terumas ha'Deshen (Kosher at night yet forbidden to a Zar).</p></div>
<div class="indent1"><span class="nm">(j)</span><p>Terumas ha'Deshen is the beginning of the day's Avodah (as taught in the name of R.Yochanan that once a Kohen does Kidush Yadayim for the Terumas ha'Deshen, he is set for the day's Avodah).</p></div>
<div class="indent1"><span class="nm">(k)</span><p><span class="cl">Question:</span> Then R. Zeira's claim is a question on R. Yochanan!</p></div>
<div class="indent1"><span class="nm">(l)</span><p><span class="cl">Answer:</span> R. Yochanan meant that a Zar would be Chayav if he did Sidur of the two Gizrei Eitzim (Avodas Yom).</p></div>
<div class="indent1"><span class="nm">(m)</span><p><span class="cl">Question (Rava):</span> Then this Sidur should require a Payis!?</p></div>
<div class="indent1"><span class="nm">(n)</span><p>Rava forgot the answer from the Beraisa which provides that the one who wins the Terumas ha'Deshen also wins Sidur of the Ma'arachah as well as the two Gizrei Eitzim.</p></div>
<div class="indent1"><span class="nm">(o)</span><p><span class="cl">Question:</span> Would only an Avodas Yom get a Payis, what about Eivarim and Pedarim which are in the fourth Payis!?</p></div>
<div class="indent1"><span class="nm">(p)</span><p><span class="cl">Answer:</span> That is the end of the day's Avodah.</p></div>
<div class="indent1"><span class="nm">(q)</span><p><span class="cl">Question:</span> But what about the Terumas ha'Deshen!?</p></div>
<div class="indent1"><span class="nm">(r)</span><p><span class="cl">Answer:</span> That was because of the incident.</p></div>
<div class="indent1"><span class="nm">(s)</span><p><span class="cl">Question:</span> Are we to infer that there is a Payis only for Avodas Yom, and that which is forbidden to a Zar, then why is there a Payis for Shechitah!?</p></div>
<div class="indent1"><span class="nm">(t)</span><p><span class="cl">Answer:</span> Shechitah is given distinction since it is the start of the Avodas ha'Korban.</p></div>
<div class="indent1"><span class="nm">(u)</span><p><span class="cl">Question:</span> But we have a Mishnah which indicates that Sidur of the two Gizrei Eitzim is <i>not</i> part of Avodas Yom (since they did not look for daybreak to do it)?</p></div>
<div class="indent1"><span class="nm">(v)</span><p><span class="cl">Answer:</span> The Mishnah only mentioned looking for daybreak for that Avodah which, if inadvertently done before daybreak, is irreparable.</p></div>
