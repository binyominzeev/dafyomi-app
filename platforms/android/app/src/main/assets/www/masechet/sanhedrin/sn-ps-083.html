<p class="bas indent1"><span class="nm">(a)</span><span class="cl">Question (Mishnah):</span> If any of the following Avodos were done outside the Mikdash, or by a Zar, or by one who was Tamei, or lacking Bigdei Kehunah, or did not wash his hands and feet, he is exempt:</p>
<p class="bas indent2"><span class="nm">1.</span>Yetzikah (putting oil on a Minchah), kneading it, breaking it into pieces, salting (a Korban), Tenufah (waving), bringing a Minchah close to the Mizbe'ach, putting Lechem ha'Panim on the Shulchan, fixing the Neros of the Menorah, Kemitzah (taking a handful from a Minchah), or Kabalah (collecting blood of a Korban in a Keli);</p>
<p class="bas indent2"><span class="nm">2.</span><span class="cl">Inference:</span> The Mishnah did not mention Haktarah (burning). One who burned (b'Tum'ah) would be liable!</p>
<p class="bas indent3"><span class="nm">i.</span><span class="cl">Suggestion:</span> He would be Chayav Misah.</p>
<p class="bas indent1"><span class="nm">(b)</span><span class="cl">Answer:</span> No, he transgresses only a Lav.</p>
<p class="bas indent1"><span class="nm">(c)</span><span class="cl">Question:</span> The Mishnah also discusses a Zar, who is Chayav Misah (for proper Avodah) - "veha'Zar ha'Karev Yumas"!</p>
<p class="bas indent1"><span class="nm">(d)</span><span class="cl">Answer:</span> The Mishnah does not say that their laws are the same. A Zar is Chayav Misah for Avodah, but a Tamei Kohen transgresses only a Lav.</p>
<p class="bas indent1"><span class="nm">(e)</span><span class="cl">Question:</span> If the Mishnah omitted Haktarah because he transgresses a Lav, this implies that for Yetzikah, kneading..., for which the Mishnah exempts, he does not transgress even a Lav!</p>
<p class="bas indent2"><span class="nm">1.</span><span class="cl">(Beraisa):</span> "Kedoshim Yihyu... v'Lo Yechalelu" forbids Yetzikah and kneading b'Tum'ah.</p>
<p class="bas indent1"><span class="nm">(f)</span>The Isur is only mid'Rabanan. The verse is only an Asmachta.</p>
<p class="bas indent1"><span class="nm">(g)</span><span class="cl">Question (Beraisa):</span> The following are Chayav Misah (b'Yedei Shamayim) -...a Tamei (Kohen) who did Avodah...</p>
<p class="bas indent1"><span class="nm">(h)</span>Rav Sheshes is refuted.</p>
<p class="bas subject"><span class="nm">2)</span>AVEIROS WITH MISAH B'YEDEI SHAMAYIM</p>
<p class="bas indent1"><span class="nm">(a)</span><span class="cl">(Beraisa):</span> The following are Chayav Misah (in this Sugya, this always means b'Yedei b'Yedei Shamayim):</p>
<p class="bas indent2"><span class="nm">1.</span>One who eats Tevel, a Tamei Kohen who eats Tahor Terumah, a Zar who eats Terumah;</p>
<p class="bas indent2"><span class="nm">2.</span>A Zar who did Avodah, or one who did Avodah when he was Tamei, a Tvul Yom, Mechusar Begadim (lacking Bigdei Kehunah), Mechusar Kipurim (did not bring Korbanos that finish his Taharah, e.g. of a Zav...), without washing his hands and feet, Shtuyei Yayin (after drinking wine), or Pru'ei Rosh (did not cut his hair for 30 days).</p>
<p class="bas indent1"><span class="nm">(b)</span>If one did Avodah when he was an Arel (uncircumcised), Onen (the day he lost a relative) or sitting, he transgressed a Lav, but he is not Chayav Misah.</p>
<p class="bas indent1"><span class="nm">(c)</span>Rebbi says, if a Ba'al Mum did Avodah he is Chayav Misah;</p>
<p class="bas indent1"><span class="nm">(d)</span>Chachamim say, he transgresses only a Lav.</p>
<p class="bas indent1"><span class="nm">(e)</span>Rebbi says, if someone intentionally transgresses Me'ilah he is Chayav Misah;</p>
<p class="bas indent1"><span class="nm">(f)</span>Chachamim say, he transgresses only a Lav.</p>
<p class="bas indent1"><span class="nm">(g)</span><span class="cl">Question:</span> What is the source for one who eats Tevel?</p>
<p class="bas indent1"><span class="nm">(h)</span><span class="cl">Answer (Shmuel):</span> One who eats Tevel (untithed produce) is Chayav Misah (b'Yedei Shomayim). The future tense "v'Lo Yechalelu Es Kodshei Bnei Yisrael Asher <i>Yarimu</i>" refers to something from which Terumah will be taken, i.e. Tevel;</p>
<p class="bas indent2"><span class="nm">1.</span>A Gezerah Shavah "Chilul-Chilul" from Terumah teaches that one is Chayav Misah for it (Tevel ), just like for Terumah.</p>
<p class="bas indent1"><span class="nm">(i)</span><span class="cl">Question:</span> Why don't we learn the Gezerah Shavah from Nosar, which is Chayavei Kerisus?</p>
<p class="bas indent1"><span class="nm">(j)</span><span class="cl">Answer:</span> It is more reasonable to learn from Terumah, for this resembles Tevel in the following ways:</p>
<p class="bas indent2"><span class="nm">1.</span>Terumah will be taken from Tevel, they never applied (mid'Oraisa) in Chutz la'Aretz (whereas Nosar applied in the Midbar and to Korbanos brought on Bamos in Chutz la'Aretz), they can become permitted (Tevel is permitted after tithing it, a Tamei Kohen is permitted Terumah after becoming Tahor), the Torah uses plural forms regarding them (Yechalelu and Yechaleluhu, as opposed to the singular Chilel regarding Nosar), they apply to Peros, and Pigul does not apply to them.</p>
<p class="bas indent1"><span class="nm">(k)</span><span class="cl">Question:</span> We should learn from Nosar, for this resembles Tevel in the following ways:</p>
<p class="bas indent2"><span class="nm">1.</span>The food itself is forbidden (whereas the Misah for Terumah is if the eater is a Zar or Tamei), and a Mikveh does not permit the Isur.</p>
<p class="bas indent1"><span class="nm">(l)</span><span class="cl">Answer #1:</span> There are more similarities to Terumah.</p>
<p class="bas indent1"><span class="nm">(m)</span><span class="cl">Answer #2 (Ravina):</span> The overriding criterion is that the Torah uses plural forms regarding Tevel and Terumah.</p>
<p class="bas indent1"><span class="nm">(n)</span><span class="cl">Question:</span> What is the source for a Tamei Kohen who eats Tahor Terumah?</p>
<p class="bas indent1"><span class="nm">(o)</span><span class="cl">Answer (Shmuel):</span> If a Tamei Kohen ate Tahor Terumah he is Chayav Misah - "v'Shomru... v'Lo Yechaleluhu";</p>
<p class="bas indent2"><span class="nm">1.</span><span class="cl">Inference:</span> He is not liable for eating Tamei Terumah.</p>
<p class="bas indent2"><span class="nm">2.</span><span class="cl">(Shmuel citing R. Eliezer):</span> If a Tamei Kohen ate Tamei Terumah he is not Chayav Misah. "U'Mesu <i>Vo</i> Ki Yechaleluhu" excludes Tamei Terumah, which is already profaned.</p>

<p class="bas indent1"><span class="nm">(c)</span><span class="cl">Question (Rav Kahana and R. Asi):</span> You should teach that he is Chayav Misah - "v'Chol Zar Lo Yochal Kodesh"!</p>
<p class="bas indent1"><span class="nm">(d)</span><span class="cl">Answer (Rav):</span> The words "Ani Hash-m Mekadsham" separate between Misah (in the previous verse) and "v'Chol Zar...", therefore a Zar is not Chayav Misah.</p>

<p class="bas indent1"><span class="nm">(b)</span>We learn from "veha'Zar ha'Karev Yumas."</p>

<p class="bas indent1"><span class="nm">(e)</span><span class="cl">Answer (Rav Yosef):</span> It says "va'Yinozru mi'Kodshei...v'Lo <i>Yechalelu</i>." We learn from a Gezerah Shavah "Chilul- Chilul" from a Tamei person who ate Terumah, which is Chayav Misah.</p>
<p class="bas indent1"><span class="nm">(f)</span><span class="cl">Question:</span> Why don't we learn the Gezerah Shavah from Nosar, which is Chayavei Kerisus?</p>
<p class="bas indent1"><span class="nm">(g)</span><span class="cl">Answer:</span> It is more reasonable to learn from eating Terumah b'Tum'ah, for this resembles Avodah b'Tum'ah in the following ways:</p>
<p class="bas indent2"><span class="nm">1.</span>The person himself is forbidden, it is forbidden due to Tum'ah, a Mikveh permits them, and the Torah uses plural forms (of Chilul) regarding them.</p>

<p class="bas indent1"><span class="nm">(i)</span><span class="cl">Answer:</span> The overriding criterion is that the Torah uses plural forms regarding Avodah and Terumah b'Tum'ah.</p>

<p class="bas indent1"><span class="nm">(k)</span><span class="cl">Question:</span> What is the source of this?</p>
<p class="bas indent1"><span class="nm">(l)</span><span class="cl">Answer (Beraisa - R. Simai):</span> "Va'Yinozru..." teaches that a Tamei is Mechalel Avodah (anything he offered is Pasul). Therefore, we use "Kedoshim Yihyu... v'Lo Yechalelu" to teach that a Tvul Yom is Mechalel Avodah;</p>
<p class="bas indent2"><span class="nm">1.</span>We learn that he is Chayav Misah from "Chilul- Chilul" from a Tamei person who ate Terumah.</p>
<p class="bas indent1"><span class="nm">(m)</span><span class="cl">Question:</span> What is the source that Mechusar Begadim is Chayav Misah?</p>
<p class="bas indent1"><span class="nm">(n)</span><span class="cl">Answer (R. Avahu):</span> "V'Chogarta Osam Avnet... v'Haysah Lahem Kehunah" - they are (considered) Kohanim only when Bigdei Kehunah are on them;</p>
<p class="bas indent2"><span class="nm">1.</span>If not, they are Zarim, who are Chayav Misah for Avodah (like we taught above).</p>

<p class="bas indent1"><span class="nm">(p)</span><span class="cl">Answer (Rav Huna):</span> "V'Chiper Aleha ha'Kohen v'Taherah" shows that she (a woman who gave birth) is called Teme'ah until her Korban is offered (presumably, the same applies to every Mechusar Kipurim);</p>
<p class="bas indent2"><span class="nm">1.</span>We already taught that a Tamei is Chayav Misah for Avodah.</p>
