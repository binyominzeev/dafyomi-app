<p class="bas subject"><span class="nm">1)</span>THE PROPER WAY TO DO <i>YIBUM</i></p>
<p class="bas indent1"><span class="nm">(a)</span><span class="cl">(Mishnah) Question:</span> How is this? If he gave a Ma'amar...</p>
<p class="bas indent1"><span class="nm">(b)</span><span class="cl">Question:</span> 'How is this' connotes that we explain the Reisha (a Get after a Get), but the Mishnah does not explain this!</p>
<p class="bas indent1"><span class="nm">(c)</span><span class="cl">Answer (Rav Yehudah):</span> Indeed, the Mishnah never explains a Get after a Get or a Ma'amar after a Ma'amar. They are like in the Beraisa (above);</p>
<p class="bas indent2"><span class="nm">1.</span>Rather, it asks how we permit a Yevamah (who received a Ma'amar and a Get). It teaches that she needs Chalitzah.</p>
<p class="bas indent1"><span class="nm">(d)</span><span class="cl">(Mishnah):</span> If he gave a Ma'amar and did Bi'ah, he did the Mitzvah properly.</p>
<p class="bas indent1"><span class="nm">(e)</span><span class="cl">Suggestion:</span> This supports Rav Huna.</p>
<p class="bas indent2"><span class="nm">1.</span><span class="cl">(Rav Huna):</span> The proper way do Yibum is to Mekadesh the Yevamah first (with a Ma'amar).</p>
<p class="bas indent1"><span class="nm">(f)</span><span class="cl">Rejection:</span> Perhaps the Mishnah says that this is <i>also</i> a proper way to do Yibum!</p>
<p class="bas indent1"><span class="nm">(g)</span><span class="cl">Objection:</span> This is obvious!</p>
<p class="bas indent1"><span class="nm">(h)</span><span class="cl">Answer:</span> It is not obvious;</p>
<p class="bas indent2"><span class="nm">1.</span>We learned that a Ma'amar removes Zikah of Yibum and makes her like an Arusah awaiting Nisu'in. One might have thought that Bi'ah afterwards is not the Mitzvah (of Yibum, just standard Nisu'in)!</p>
<p class="bas indent1"><span class="nm">(i)</span><span class="cl">Rav Huna:</span> The proper way do Yibum is after being Mekadesh the Yevamah. If he did Yibum and then gave a Ma'amar, he acquired her.</p>
<p class="bas indent1"><span class="nm">(j)</span><span class="cl">Question:</span> This is obvious, for Yibum acquired her!</p>
<p class="bas indent1"><span class="nm">(k)</span><span class="cl">Correction:</span> Rather, (even) if he did Yibum without a Ma'amar, he acquired her.</p>
<p class="bas indent1"><span class="nm">(l)</span><span class="cl">Question (Beraisa):</span> If he does Yibum without a Ma'amar, he is lashed. (If he acquired her, why would he be lashed?)</p>
<p class="bas indent1"><span class="nm">(m)</span><span class="cl">Answer:</span> The lashes are only mid'Rabanan;</p>
<p class="bas indent2"><span class="nm">1.</span>Rav lashes for the following;</p>
<p class="bas indent3"><span class="nm">i.</span>One who is Mekadesh through Bi'ah, or in the market (in public), or without prior arrangement;</p>
<p class="bas indent3"><span class="nm">ii.</span>One who is Mevatel (invalidates) a Get (that was sent with a Shali'ach, lest his wife remarry before hearing that the Get is Batel);</p>
<p class="bas indent3"><span class="nm">iii.</span>One who tells witnesses that he is being coerced to divorce, and the Get he will give is invalid (people will suspect that his wife's future children are Mamzerim);</p>
<p class="bas indent3"><span class="nm">iv.</span>One who is brazen to a Shali'ach of Chachamim;</p>
<p class="bas indent3"><span class="nm">v.</span>One who stays in excommunication for 30 days without coming to Beis Din to request that it be lifted;</p>
<p class="bas indent3"><span class="nm">vi.</span>One who lives by his mother-in-law.</p>
<p class="bas indent2"><span class="nm">2.</span><span class="cl">Question:</span> Is he lashed only if he lives by her, but not for passing by? Rav Sheshes lashed a man for passing by his mother-in-law's porch!</p>
<p class="bas indent2"><span class="nm">3.</span><span class="cl">Answer:</span> That was a special case. He was suspected of having Bi'ah with her.</p>
<p class="bas indent1"><span class="nm">(n)</span><span class="cl">Version #1 (Chachamim of Nehardai):</span> Rav lashes only for one who is Mekadesh through Bi'ah without prior arrangement.</p>
<p class="bas indent1"><span class="nm">(o)</span><span class="cl">Version #2:</span> Some say that he lashes even with prior arrangement, because it is lewdness.</p>
<p class="bas subject"><span class="nm">2)</span>THE ENACTMENT OF <i>MA'AMAR</i></p>
<p class="bas indent1"><span class="nm">(a)</span><span class="cl">(Beraisa):</span> How is Ma'amar done? He gives her money, or something of monetary value;</p>
<p class="bas indent1"><span class="nm">(b)</span><span class="cl">Question:</span> How is it done with a document?</p>
<p class="bas indent2"><span class="nm">1.</span><span class="cl">Objection:</span> Obviously, it is like Kidushin through a document! We learned that he writes to her on paper or on pottery, even if it is not worth a Perutah, 'you are Mekudeshes to me'.</p>
<p class="bas indent2"><span class="nm">2.</span><span class="cl">Answer (Abaye):</span> The Beraisa asks about a Kesuvah of Yibum.</p>
<p class="bas indent1"><span class="nm">(c)</span><span class="cl">Answer:</span> He writes 'I, Ploni, accept to feed and support my Yevamah Plonis properly;</p>
<p class="bas indent2"><span class="nm">1.</span>The Kesuvah is collected from the property of the deceased;</p>
<p class="bas indent2"><span class="nm">2.</span>If there is no property from the deceased, Chachamim enacted that she has from the Yavam's property, so it should not be light in his eyes to divorce her.</p>
<p class="bas indent1"><span class="nm">(d)</span><span class="cl">Question (Abaye):</span> If one gave to his Yevamah a Get and said 'You are divorced from me, and are not permitted to any man', what is the law?</p>
<p class="bas indent2"><span class="nm">1.</span>A Get to a Yevamah is mid'Rabanan. Perhaps only a Get that permits a married woman affects a Yevamah?</p>
<p class="bas indent2"><span class="nm">2.</span>Or, perhaps it forbids Yibum, lest it be confused with a proper Get!</p>
<p class="bas indent1"><span class="nm">(e)</span><span class="cl">Answer (Rabah):</span> We are concerned lest it be confused with a proper Get.</p>
<p class="bas indent1"><span class="nm">(f)</span><span class="cl">Question (Rabah bar Chanan):</span> If so, will we forbid Yibum if he gave her any piece of paper?!</p>
<p class="bas indent1"><span class="nm">(g)</span><span class="cl">Answer (Rabah):</span> A mere paper does not forbid a girl to a Kohen. The Get Abaye asked about forbids a girl to Kehunah:</p>
<p class="bas indent2"><span class="nm">1.</span><span class="cl">(Beraisa):</span> "They (Kohanim) will not marry a woman divorced <i>from her husband</i>" - even if she was divorced only from her husband (but was not permitted to anyone), Kohanim may not marry her (even after her husband dies);</p>
<p class="bas indent2"><span class="nm">2.</span>This is 'the scent of a Get', which forbids to Kehunah.</p>
<p class="bas indent1"><span class="nm">(h)</span><span class="cl">(Rami bar Chama):</span> We learned that if a man asked a scribe to write a Get to his Arusah to give it after Nisu'in, the Get is valid, since he could divorce her now;</p>
<p class="bas bbbline">52b----------------------------------------52b</p>
<p class="bas indent2"><span class="nm">1.</span>If he told the scribe to write a Get for a woman who is not Mekudeshes to him, the Get is invalid, since he cannot divorce her.</p>
<p class="bas indent1"><span class="nm">(i)</span><span class="cl">Question (Rami bar Chama):</span> If one wrote a Get to his Yevamah, what is the law? (Rashi - can he divorce her with it after Yibum? Ri - does it disqualify to Kehunah? Rivam - if he wrote it before giving a Ma'amar, can he give the Get to undo the Ma'amar?)</p>
<p class="bas indent2"><span class="nm">1.</span>Since she is tied to him (Zekukah to do Yibum or Chalitzah), she is like his Arusah, so the Get is valid;</p>
<p class="bas indent2"><span class="nm">2.</span>Or, since he did not give a Ma'amar, we do not say this?</p>
<p class="bas indent2"><span class="nm">3.</span>The question is unresolved.</p>
<p class="bas indent1"><span class="nm">(j)</span><span class="cl">Question (R. Chanina):</span> If one wrote a Get for the Zikah (to forbid Yibum) but not to undo his Ma'amar; or, to undo his Ma'amar but not for the Zikah, what is the law?</p>
<p class="bas indent2"><span class="nm">1.</span>If Ma'amar adds to Zikah, since he wrote that the Get only works for one of these, this is like divorcing half a wife, which has no effect;</p>
<p class="bas indent2"><span class="nm">2.</span>Or, perhaps Zikah and Ma'amar coexist independently (and he can undo one)?</p>
<p class="bas indent1"><span class="nm">(k)</span><span class="cl">Suggestion:</span> We can answer this from Rava's law (32a, that it works)!</p>
<p class="bas indent2"><span class="nm">1.</span><span class="cl">(Rava):</span> If he gave a Get to undo his Ma'amar, the Tzarah is permitted.</p>
<p class="bas indent1"><span class="nm">(l)</span><span class="cl">Response:</span> Rava was sure, but R. Chanina was unsure about this.</p>
<p class="bas subject"><span class="nm">3)</span>MA'AMAR AFTER CHALITZAH</p>
<p class="bas indent1"><span class="nm">(a)</span><span class="cl">(Mishnah):</span> If he did Chalitzah and gave a Ma'amar (nothing takes effect after Chalitzah).</p>
<p class="bas indent1"><span class="nm">(b)</span><span class="cl">(Rav Yehudah):</span> This is like R. Akiva, who says that Ein Kidushin Tofsin b'Chayavei Lavin. Chachamim say that things take effect after Chalitzah.</p>
<p class="bas indent1"><span class="nm">(c)</span><span class="cl">Question:</span> The Mishnah cannot be like R. Akiva!</p>
<p class="bas indent2"><span class="nm">1.</span><span class="cl">(Reisha):</span> If he gave a Get and a Ma'amar, she needs a Get and Chalitzah.</p>
<p class="bas indent2"><span class="nm">2.</span>According to R. Akiva, once she got a Get, Ma'amar would not take effect!</p>
<p class="bas indent3"><span class="nm">i.</span><span class="cl">(Beraisa - R. Akiva):</span> If one gave a Get to his Yevamah, he may never do Yibum - "Her first husband who divorced her (cannot remarry her)".</p>
<p class="bas indent1"><span class="nm">(d)</span><span class="cl">Answer (Rav Ashi):</span> A Get to a Yevamah is only mid'Rabanan. The verse is only an Asmachta.</p>
<p class="bas indent1"><span class="nm">(e)</span><span class="cl">Support (for Rav Yehudah - Beraisa - Rebbi):</span> Our Mishnah is like R. Akiva, who considers a Chalutzah like Ervah. Chachamim say that things take effect after Chalitzah;</p>
<p class="bas indent2"><span class="nm">1.</span>I (Rebbi) say that this applies only when he intended for Kidushin. If he intended for a regular Ma'amar of a Yevamah, nothing takes effect after Chalitzah.</p>
<p class="bas indent1"><span class="nm">(f)</span><span class="cl">(Beraisa - Rebbi):</span> If a man did Chalitzah, then was Mekadesh her:</p>
<p class="bas indent2"><span class="nm">1.</span>If he intended for regular Kidushin, she needs a Get. If it was like a Ma'amar to a Yevamah, she does not need a Get;</p>
<p class="bas indent2"><span class="nm">2.</span>Chachamim say, in either case she needs a Get.</p>
<p class="bas indent1"><span class="nm">(g)</span><span class="cl">Opinion #1 (Rav Yosef):</span> (He said 'you are Mekudeshes to me.') Rebbi holds that we made the Yavam like one (Levi) who digs in the (Hefker) property of a convert (who died without heirs), and Levi thinks that the property is already his, so he does not acquire it.</p>
<p class="bas indent1"><span class="nm">(h)</span><span class="cl">Objection (Abaye):</span> There, Levi has no intention to acquire. Here, the Yavam intends to acquire her!</p>
<p class="bas indent1"><span class="nm">(i)</span><span class="cl">(Abaye):</span> A proper analogy is to one who digs in the property of a convert, and thinks that he is digging in the property of a different convert (both are Hefker. All would agree that) he acquires!</p>
<p class="bas indent1"><span class="nm">(j)</span><span class="cl">Opinion #2 (Abaye):</span> Rather, he said 'be Mekudeshes to me with this Ma'amar Yevamin':</p>
<p class="bas indent2"><span class="nm">1.</span>Rebbi holds that Ma'amar only increases an existing Zikah. Once Chalitzah ended Zikah, the Ma'amar cannot take effect;</p>
<p class="bas indent2"><span class="nm">2.</span>Chachamim hold that Ma'amar and Zikah are independent of each other. Had he given a Ma'amar Yevamin before Chalitzah, it would have worked. Now also (after Chalitzah), it works!</p>
<p class="bas indent1"><span class="nm">(k)</span><span class="cl">Objection (Rava):</span> Had he said 'with this Ma'amar Yevamin', all would agree that it takes effect!</p>
