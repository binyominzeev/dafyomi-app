<p class="bas subject"><span class="nm">1)</span>ACQUISITION OF A <i>METZI'AH</i></p>
<p class="bas indent1"><span class="nm">(a)</span><span class="cl">(Mishnah):</span> Reuven and Shimon are holding a garment. Reuven says 'I found it', and so does Shimon; Reuven says 'it is mine', and so does Shimon. Each swears that he does not own less than half, and they divide it.</p>
<p class="bas indent1"><span class="nm">(b)</span>If Reuven says 'it is all mine' and Shimon says 'it is half mine', Reuven swears that he does not own less than three quarters, and Shimon swears that he does not own less than one quarter. Each gets like he swore.</p>
<p class="bas indent1"><span class="nm">(c)</span>If two men are riding on an animal, or one is riding and the other is leading it, and each says 'it is mine', each swears that he does not own less than half, and they divide it.</p>
<p class="bas indent2"><span class="nm">1.</span>When they admit, or when they have witnesses, they divide without an oath.</p>
<p class="bas indent1"><span class="nm">(d)</span><span class="cl">(Gemara) Question:</span> Why must the Mishnah say 'Reuven says 'I found it', and so does Shimon; Reuven says 'it is mine', and so does Shimon'? It suffices for each to make one claim!</p>
<p class="bas indent1"><span class="nm">(e)</span><span class="cl">Answer #1:</span> Indeed, each makes one claim. Each says 'I found it, and it is mine.'</p>
<p class="bas indent1"><span class="nm">(f)</span><span class="cl">Question:</span> It should suffice to teach 'I found it.' We would know that he claims 'it is mine'!</p>
<p class="bas indent1"><span class="nm">(g)</span><span class="cl">Answer:</span> Had it taught only 'I found it', one might have thought that this means 'I saw it', and he acquires through seeing alone. Therefore, it teaches 'it is mine' to teach that one does not acquire through seeing alone.</p>
<p class="bas indent1"><span class="nm">(h)</span><span class="cl">Question:</span> One could not have thought that 'I found it' means that he merely saw it!</p>
<p class="bas indent2"><span class="nm">1.</span><span class="cl">(Ravnai):</span> "And you will find it" connotes that it came to your hand.</p>
<p class="bas indent1"><span class="nm">(i)</span><span class="cl">Answer:</span> Indeed, in the Torah "and you will find it" connotes that it came to your hand. The Tana speaks like people do;</p>
<p class="bas indent2"><span class="nm">1.</span>People say 'I found it' once they see it.</p>
<p class="bas indent1"><span class="nm">(j)</span><span class="cl">Question:</span> It should suffice to teach 'it is mine'!</p>
<p class="bas indent1"><span class="nm">(k)</span><span class="cl">Answer:</span> The Tana wanted to teach that one does not acquire through seeing alone;</p>
<p class="bas indent2"><span class="nm">1.</span>He teaches 'I found it' and additionally 'it is mine' to teach that mere finding (seeing) does not acquire.</p>
<p class="bas subject"><span class="nm">2)</span>ARGUING ABOUT A SALE</p>
<p class="bas indent1"><span class="nm">(a)</span><span class="cl">Objection (to Answer #1):</span> We cannot learn to say that each makes one claim. The Mishnah says 'Reuven says 'I found it' and Shimon says 'I found it'. Reuven says 'It is mine'...!'</p>
<p class="bas indent1"><span class="nm">(b)</span><span class="cl">Answer #2 (Rav Papa):</span> The Mishnah teaches two cases. 'I found it' refers to an argument about a Metzi'ah. 'It is mine' refers to an argument about who bought an item.</p>
<p class="bas indent1"><span class="nm">(c)</span>It needed to teach both cases:</p>
<p class="bas bbbline">2b----------------------------------------2b</p>
<p class="bas indent2"><span class="nm">1.</span>Had it taught only about a Metzi'ah, one might have thought that only there Chachamim imposed an oath on them, because one justifies (to himself) grabbing a Metzi'ah and claiming it (in order to receive half), since the other person did not toil for it;</p>
<p class="bas indent2"><span class="nm">2.</span>Had it taught only about a purchase, one might have thought that only there Chachamim imposed an oath on them, because one justifies claiming what was sold to another person;</p>
<p class="bas indent3"><span class="nm">i.</span>He reasons 'we both paid for it. I need it, so I will take it. He can get his money back and buy another.'</p>
<p class="bas indent1"><span class="nm">(d)</span><span class="cl">Question:</span> Why must they swear about a purchase? Surely, it was sold to the one who paid!</p>
<p class="bas indent1"><span class="nm">(e)</span><span class="cl">Answer:</span> The case is, the seller received money from both of them. He took from one willingly, and the other forced the money into his hand. We do not know from whom he accepted willingly.</p>
<p class="bas subject"><span class="nm">3)</span>LIKE WHOM IS THE MISHNAH?</p>
<p class="bas indent1"><span class="nm">(a)</span>(If Reuven told Shimon to pay Reuven's workers, Shimon says that he paid, and the workers deny this, Reuven must pay Shimon and the workers - Shevu'os 48a.)</p>
<p class="bas indent1"><span class="nm">(b)</span><span class="cl">Suggestion:</span> Our Mishnah is not like Ben Nanas, for (in the above case) he says that we do not tell both parties (Shimon and the workers) to swear, for surely one of the oaths would be false. (In our Mishnah, both swear even though one of them is a false oath!)</p>
<p class="bas indent1"><span class="nm">(c)</span><span class="cl">Rejection:</span> Our Mishnah can be like Ben Nanas. He said only there that both do not swear, for both oaths cannot be true;</p>
<p class="bas indent2"><span class="nm">1.</span>Here, perhaps both oaths are true! If they picked it up at the same time, each acquired half!</p>
<p class="bas indent1"><span class="nm">(d)</span><span class="cl">Suggestion:</span> Our Mishnah is not like Sumchus, for he holds that when in doubt about money, we divide it without an oath.</p>
<p class="bas indent2"><span class="nm">1.</span><span class="cl">Question:</span> It is not like Chachamim, either! They say that one cannot take money from another without proof!</p>
<p class="bas indent2"><span class="nm">2.</span><span class="cl">Answer:</span> It can be like Chachamim. They require a proof only to take from one who holds it (or has a Chazakah on it) by himself;</p>
<p class="bas indent3"><span class="nm">i.</span>Here, both are holding it, so they swear and divide it.</p>
<p class="bas indent2"><span class="nm">3.</span>Sumchus holds that even when one person holds it, they divide it without swearing. All the more so when both are holding it, they divide it without swearing!</p>
<p class="bas indent1"><span class="nm">(e)</span><span class="cl">Rejection:</span> Our Mishnah can even be like Sumchus. He said that they divide it without swearing only when both parties are unsure. Here both parties make definite claims, so they swear and divide it.</p>
<p class="bas indent1"><span class="nm">(f)</span><span class="cl">Question:</span> Rabah holds that Sumchus says that they divide without swearing even when both make definite claims. Can he establish the Mishnah like Sumchus?</p>
<p class="bas indent1"><span class="nm">(g)</span><span class="cl">Answer #1:</span> Yes. Sumchus said that they divide it without swearing only when there is Drara of money. Here, there is no Drara. (Rashi - Drara is a loss of money. Not acquiring a Metzi'ah is not considered a loss. Tosfos - Drara is when even without their claims, Beis Din had a doubt. Here, the doubt is due to their claims. Ramban - it is a claim based on an undisputed Chazakah.)</p>
