<p class="bas subject"><span class="nm">1)</span>THE SHALIACH TZIBUR (cont.)</p>
<p class="bas indent1"><span class="nm">(a)</span><span class="cl">Question:</span> Surely R. Yochanan has been cited as saying that the Halachah follows R. Gamliel with Rosh Hashanah and Yom Kipur, implying that there is a dispute even with these days!?</p>
<p class="bas indent1"><span class="nm">(b)</span><span class="cl">Answer:</span> It is R. Meir who R. Yochanan said concedes to R. Gamliel, and the other Rabanan who argue, as we see in a Beraisa:</p>
<p class="bas indent2"><span class="nm">1.</span><span class="cl">(R. Meir):</span> The Shali'ach Tzibur is Motzi the congregation for the prayers of Rosh Hashanah and Yom Kipur of Yovel.</p>
<p class="bas indent2"><span class="nm">2.</span><span class="cl">(Chachamim):</span> Just as the Shali'ach Tzibur must say them, so too must all the congregation.</p>
<p class="bas indent3"><span class="nm">i.</span><span class="cl">Question:</span> Why should these days be different - if it's because of the numerous Pesukim, R. Chananel ruled that he just needs to say "as written in the Torah"?</p>
<p class="bas indent3"><span class="nm">ii.</span><span class="cl">Answer:</span> They are different because the Berachos are long.</p>
<p class="bas indent1"><span class="nm">(c)</span>They thought that R. Chananel's ruling applied only to an individual, but R. Yehoshua ben Levi said that it applies even to a congregation.</p>
<p class="bas subject"><span class="nm">2)</span>ARRANGING PRAYERS</p>
<p class="bas indent1"><span class="nm">(a)</span><span class="cl">(R. Elazar):</span> A person should always arrange his prayer in his mind and then pray.</p>
<p class="bas indent1"><span class="nm">(b)</span><span class="cl">(R. Aba):</span> This is only reasonable for the prayers of Rosh Hashanah, Yom Kipur, and special occasions (festivals).</p>
<p class="bas indent2"><span class="nm">1.</span><span class="cl">Question:</span> R. Yehudah would do this even on a weekday!?</p>
<p class="bas indent2"><span class="nm">2.</span><span class="cl">Answer:</span> Since he only prayed every thirty days, it was like a special occasion for him.</p>
<p class="bas indent1"><span class="nm">(c)</span><span class="cl">(R. Cha bar Avira):</span> R. Gamliel held that the Shali'ach Tzibur was even Motzi those people in the fields.</p>
<p class="bas indent1"><span class="nm">(d)</span><span class="cl">Question:</span> This implies that it is unnecessary to state that he is Motzi those who are in the town - but those in the fields have more reason to be Yotzei with the Shali'ach Tzibur, as they are unable to come!</p>
<p class="bas indent2"><span class="nm">1.</span>Similarly, we find that while those people who are behind the Kohanim are not included in the Berachos, those in the fields are included!</p>
<p class="bas indent1"><span class="nm">(e)</span><span class="cl">Answer:</span> Emend it to read that R. Gamliel held that the Shali'ach Tzibur was <i>only</i> Motzi those people in the fields.</p>
<p class="bas indent2"><span class="nm">1.</span>The reason is that they are forced to miss the prayers, but those in the town have the opportunity for it.</p>
