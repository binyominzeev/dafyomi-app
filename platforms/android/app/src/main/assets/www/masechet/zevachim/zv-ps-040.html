<div class="subject"><span class="nm">1)</span><p>BLOOD OF INNER <i>CHATA'OS</i> (cont.)</p></div>
<div class="indent1"><span class="nm">(a)</span><p><span class="cl">(Beraisa) Suggestion:</span> Perhaps this applies only to the seven Haza'os, for they are always Me'akev...</p></div>
<div class="indent2"><span class="nm">1.</span><p><span class="cl">Question:</span> Where do we find that seven Haza'os are Me'akev?</p></div>
<div class="indent2"><span class="nm">2.</span><p><span class="cl">Answer (Rav Papa):</span> They are Me'akev in Parah Adumah and Taharah of a Metzora.</p></div>
<div class="indent1"><span class="nm">(b)</span><p><span class="cl">(Beraisa) Question:</span> What is the source that the four Matanos are Me'akev?</p></div>
<div class="indent2"><span class="nm">1.</span><p><span class="cl">Answer:</span> "Ken Ya'aseh".</p></div>
<div class="indent1"><span class="nm">(c)</span><p><span class="cl">Question:</span> We know that seven Matanos are Me'akev because it says 'seven', and "Ka'asher Asah" repeats the command for seven;</p></div>
<div class="indent2"><span class="nm">1.</span><p>Likewise, the Torah teaches four Matanos, and "Ka'asher Asah" repeats the command!</p></div>
<div class="indent1"><span class="nm">(d)</span><p><span class="cl">Answer #1 (R. Yirmeyah):</span> The Beraisa is like R. Shimon (who needs Ka'asher Asah to teach four Matanos).</p></div>
<div class="indent2"><span class="nm">1.</span><p><span class="cl">(Beraisa - R. Shimon):</span> It says (regarding Par Mashu'ach) Keranos, teaching two, and also regarding Par He'elem Davar. "Ka'Asher Asah" teaches that these are in addition to the two of Par Mashu'ach.</p></div>
<div class="indent2"><span class="nm">2.</span><p>R. Yehudah says, "b'Ohel Mo'ed" teaches that we must put on all the (four) Keranos in the Ohel Mo'ed.</p></div>
<div class="indent1"><span class="nm">(e)</span><p><span class="cl">Question:</span> What does R. Yehudah learn from "Ken Ya'aseh"?</p></div>
<div class="indent1"><span class="nm">(f)</span><p><span class="cl">Answer:</span> It teaches like the following Beraisa.</p></div>
<div class="indent2"><span class="nm">1.</span><p><span class="cl">(Beraisa) Question:</span> What is the source for Semichah and pouring Shirayim of the blood of the Par of Yom Kipur?</p></div>
<div class="indent2"><span class="nm">2.</span><p><span class="cl">Answer:</span> "Ken Ya'aseh".</p></div>
<div class="indent1"><span class="nm">(g)</span><p><span class="cl">Question:</span> The Beraisa above (39a-b) learned this from "la'Par"!</p></div>
<div class="indent1"><span class="nm">(h)</span><p><span class="cl">Answer:</span> That teaches only about Avodos that are Me'akev Kaparah. We need Ken Ya'aseh to teach about Semichah and Shirayim, which are not Me'akev Kaparah.</p></div>
<div class="indent1"><span class="nm">(i)</span><p><span class="cl">Question:</span> How does R. Shimon expound "b'Ohel Mo'ed"?</p></div>
<div class="indent1"><span class="nm">(j)</span><p><span class="cl">Answer:</span> This teaches that if there was a break in the ceiling of the Heichal, the Haza'os may not be done.</p></div>
<div class="indent1"><span class="nm">(k)</span><p><span class="cl">Question:</span> What is R. Yehudah's source for this?</p></div>
<div class="indent1"><span class="nm">(l)</span><p><span class="cl">Answer:</span> He learns this from "Asher".</p></div>
<div class="indent2"><span class="nm">1.</span><p>R. Shimon does not expound "Asher".</p></div>
<div class="indent1"><span class="nm">(m)</span><p><span class="cl">Answer #2 (to Question (c) - Abaye):</span> The Beraisa is even like R. Yehudah. One might have thought that even though the four Matanos are written and repeated, they are not Me'akev, just like Semichah and Shirayim.</p></div>
<div class="subject"><span class="nm">2)</span><p>THE <i>PAR</i> OF YOM KIPUR</p></div>
<div class="indent1"><span class="nm">(a)</span><p><span class="cl">(Beraisa):</span> "La'Par" refers to the Par of Yom Kipur.</p></div>
<div class="indent1"><span class="nm">(b)</span><p><span class="cl">Question:</span> What do we learn from this?</p></div>
<div class="indent1"><span class="nm">(c)</span><p><span class="cl">Answer #1:</span> It teaches that the Haza'os of the Par of Yom Kipur are Me'akev.</p></div>
<div class="indent1"><span class="nm">(d)</span><p><span class="cl">Objection:</span> We already know this. It says "Chukah"! (This always teaches that a Parshah is Me'akev.)</p></div>
<div class="indent1"><span class="nm">(e)</span><p><span class="cl">Defense of answer (Rav Nachman bar Yitzchak):</span> It teaches this according to R. Yehudah, who says that "Chukah" applies only to Avodos in the Kodesh ha'Kodoshim done in the white garments, and if anything was done out of order, it was not Mechaper;</p></div>
<div class="indent2"><span class="nm">1.</span><p>He holds that Avodos outside the Kodesh ha'Kodoshim are Mechaper even if done out of order. One might have thought that since "Chukah" does not apply to them, they are not Me'akev. "La'Par" teaches that this is not so.</p></div>
<div class="indent1"><span class="nm">(f)</span><p><span class="cl">Objection (Rav Papa - Beraisa - R. Akiva):</span> "<i>V'Chilah mi'Kaper</i> Es ha'Kodesh" - if the Kohen did all the Avodos normally necessary to be Mechaper, Chilah (he finished the Kaparah, even if some Avodos were omitted);</p></div>
<div class="indent2"><span class="nm">1.</span><p>R. Yehudah says, we expound the words in order. If the Kohen Chilah (finished all the Avodos); he was Mechaper. If not, he was not. (This is R. Yehudah's source that all the Avodos are Me'akev!)</p></div>
<div class="indent1"><span class="nm">(g)</span><p><span class="cl">Answer #2 (Rav Papa):</span> "La'Par" teaches that the laws learned from "Es", "ba'Dam" and "v'Taval" apply to the Par of Yom Kipur (we proceed to explain them):</p></div>
<div class="indent2"><span class="nm">1.</span><p><span class="cl">(Rav Acha bar Yakov):</span> (The blood must be put with his index finger.) "Es" teaches that a wart on his finger is Batel to (and considered part of) his finger. It may be used;</p></div>
<div class="bbbline">40b----------------------------------------40b</p></div>
<div class="indent2"><span class="nm">2.</span><p>"Ba'Dam" teaches that he must receive enough blood in the Keli to dip his finger in (Rashi - from the beginning. He cannot add to it blood received in another Keli);</p></div>
<div class="indent2"><span class="nm">3.</span><p>"V'Taval" teaches that he must dip his finger into the blood. He may not scrape blood from the wall of the bucket onto his finger.</p></div>
<div class="indent2"><span class="nm">4.</span><p>The Torah must teach both of these.</p></div>
<div class="indent3"><span class="nm">i.</span><p>Had it said only v'Taval, one might have thought that even if he did not initially receive enough blood in the Keli, it is Kosher. Therefore, it says ba'Dam;</p></div>
<div class="indent3"><span class="nm">ii.</span><p>Had it said only ba'Dam, one might have thought that he may scrape blood onto his finger. Therefore, it says v'Taval.</p></div>
<div class="indent1"><span class="nm">(h)</span><p>"Mizbach Ketores ha'Samim" teaches that the Haza'os may not be done on a (new) inner Mizbe'ach until incense has been offered on it.</p></div>
<div class="indent1"><span class="nm">(i)</span><p><span class="cl">Support (for Rav Papa - Beraisa - Rebbi):</span> "V'Asah <i>la'Par</i> Ka'asher Asah..." teaches that everything (done to Par He'elem Davar) is done to the Par of Yom Kipur;</p></div>
<div class="indent2"><span class="nm">1.</span><p>R. Yishmael says, a Kal va'Chomer teaches this. We find (two) Korbanos for which different animals are brought, yet the Avodos are the same. Korbanos for which when the same animal is brought, all the more so the Avodos are the same! (This will be explained.)</p></div>
<div class="indent2"><span class="nm">2.</span><p>Rather, the first "la'Par" refers to Par He'elem Davar, and the Torah equates it to Par Mashu'ach (the second "la'Par" in the verse).</p></div>
<div class="indent1"><span class="nm">(j)</span><p><span class="cl">Question:</span> Which Korbanos of different animals does R. Yishmael refer to?</p></div>
<div class="indent2"><span class="nm">1.</span><p><span class="cl">Suggestion:</span> He refers to the Par and Sa'ir of Yom Kipur.</p></div>
<div class="indent2"><span class="nm">2.</span><p><span class="cl">Rejection:</span> The blood of both of them is brought into the Kodesh ha'Kodoshim, therefore all their Avodos are the same. This is no source to equate the Avodah of Par Yom Kipur to a Par (He'elem Davar) that is not brought inside!</p></div>
<div class="indent1"><span class="nm">(k)</span><p><span class="cl">Answer #1:</span> Rather, he refers to Par He'elem Davar and a Se'ir Avodah Zarah.</p></div>
<div class="indent1"><span class="nm">(l)</span><p><span class="cl">Rejection:</span> Both of them atone for a known Aveirah. We cannot learn from them to the Par of Yom Kipur, which atones for Aveiros (of Tum'ah) that are not yet known!</p></div>
<div class="indent1"><span class="nm">(m)</span><p><span class="cl">Answer #2:</span> Rather, he refers to Par He'elem Davar and Se'ir Yom Kipur;</p></div>
<div class="indent2"><span class="nm">1.</span><p>Different animals are brought for them, yet the Avodos are the same (e.g. dipping the finger in the blood and sprinkling on the Paroches and the inner Mizbe'ach. Even though there are more Matanos of the blood of the Sa'ir, every Avodah of the Par applies to the Sa'ir);</p></div>
<div class="indent2"><span class="nm">2.</span><p>A Par is brought on Yom Kipur, just like for a sin through Hora'ah of a Mashu'ach (our text, Rashi; Tosfos - of the Tzibur). All the more so the Avodos of these Korbanos should be the same regarding Es, ba'Dam and Tevilah!</p></div>
<div class="indent2"><span class="nm">3.</span><p>This Kal va'Chomer enables us to learn Se'ir Yom Kipur from Se'ir Avodah Zarah.</p></div>
