<div class="subject"><span class="nm">1)</span><p>PEOPLE WHO BECOME PERMITTED AT NIGHT</p></div>
<div class="indent1"><span class="nm">(a)</span><p><span class="cl">(Mishnah):</span> An Onen immerses and eats Pesach at night; this is forbidden regarding other Kodshim.</p></div>
<div class="indent1"><span class="nm">(b)</span><p>One who heard that he lost a relative [a while ago] or gathers bones [of a parent for reinterment - both of these mourn that day, but not at night] immerses and eats Kodshim [at night].</p></div>
<div class="indent1"><span class="nm">(c)</span><p>Beis Shamai say, if someone converted on Erev Pesach, he immerses and eats Pesach at night;</p></div>
<div class="indent1"><span class="nm">(d)</span><p>Beis Hillel say, one who takes leave of his foreskin (circumcises) is like one who takes leave of a grave (he requires Taharah like a Tamei Mes).</p></div>
<div class="indent1"><span class="nm">(e)</span><p><span class="cl">(Gemara) Question:</span> Why is Pesach permitted but not Kodshim?</p></div>
<div class="indent1"><span class="nm">(f)</span><p><span class="cl">Answer:</span> The Tana holds that Aninus applies mid'Rabanan at night;</p></div>
<div class="indent2"><span class="nm">1.</span><p>Chachamim did not apply this stringency to Pesach, for which there is Kares [for not bringing it]; they apply their stringency regarding [eating other] Kodshim, which is a regular Mitzvas Ase.</p></div>
<div class="indent1"><span class="nm">(g)</span><p><span class="cl">(Mishnah):</span> One who heard that he lost a relative...</p></div>
<div class="indent1"><span class="nm">(h)</span><p><span class="cl">Question:</span> One who gathers bones [becomes Tamei Mes, he] needs Haza'ah on days three and seven!</p></div>
<div class="indent1"><span class="nm">(i)</span><p><span class="cl">Answer:</span> It means, one who had someone gather bones for him...</p></div>
<div class="indent1"><span class="nm">(j)</span><p><span class="cl">(Mishnah):</span> If someone converted...</p></div>
<div class="indent1"><span class="nm">(k)</span><p><span class="cl">(Rabah bar bar Chanah):</span> They argue about an Arel Nochri [who circumcised and converted] - Beis Hillel decree, lest he will become Tamei Mes next Erev Pesach, and think that he can immerse and eat Pesach at night, just like this year (even though [presumably] he was exposed to Tum'as Mes before conversion, and never was sprinkled on);</p></div>
<div class="indent2"><span class="nm">1.</span><p>He will not realize that this year immersion sufficed because he was not Mekabel Tum'ah while he was a Nochri, but next year he is Mekabel Tum'ah [and needs Haza'ah].</p></div>
<div class="indent2"><span class="nm">2.</span><p>Beis Shamai do not decree.</p></div>
<div class="indent1"><span class="nm">(l)</span><p>All agree that if a Yisrael circumcises, he immerses and eats Pesach at night - we do not decree on account of an Arel Nochri (the Yisrael must immerse because until now he was forbidden to eat Kodshim - Chagigah 24B; see Tosfos Chodoshim).</p></div>
<div class="indent1"><span class="nm">(m)</span><p><span class="cl">Support (Beraisa - R. Shimon ben Elazar):</span> Beis Shamai and Beis Hillel agree that if a Yisrael circumcises, he immerses and eats Pesach at night - they argue about an Arel Nochri:</p></div>
<div class="indent2"><span class="nm">1.</span><p>Beis Shamai say, he immerses and eats Pesach at night;</p></div>
<div class="indent2"><span class="nm">2.</span><p>Beis Hillel say, one who takes leave of his foreskin is like one who takes leave of a grave.</p></div>
<div class="subject"><span class="nm">2)</span><p>WHICH DECREES ARE RELAXED ON ACCOUNT OF KARES?</p></div>
<div class="indent1"><span class="nm">(a)</span><p><span class="cl">(Rava):</span> Regarding Arel, Haza'ah and a knife, Chachamim upheld their enactments even regarding Kares (preventing bringing Pesach); regarding Onen, Metzora and Beis ha'Pras, they did not uphold their enactments regarding Kares (as we explain):</p></div>
<div class="indent2"><span class="nm">1.</span><p>Arel - like above (one who converted on Erev Pesach is like a Tamei Mes, he may not bring Pesach);</p></div>
<div class="indent2"><span class="nm">2.</span><p>Haza'ah (sprinkling Mei Chatas) is Shevus (forbidden mid'Rabanan on Shabbos), it is not Docheh Shabbos even if it is necessary to enable one to Metaher in time to offer Pesach;</p></div>
<div class="indent2"><span class="nm">3.</span><p><span class="cl">A knife - (Beraisa):</span> Just like one may not bring [a knife to circumcise on Shabbos] via Reshus ha'Rabim, it is forbidden via roofs, Chatzeros and Karfifos (enclosed areas without a roof, even though the Isur to transfer through these Reshuyos is mid'Rabanan; one who has not yet circumcised his son may not bring Pesach.)</p></div>
<div class="indent2"><span class="nm">4.</span><p>Onen - like above (he may not eat Kodshim at night, but he may eat Pesach);</p></div>
<div class="indent2"><span class="nm">5.</span><p><span class="cl">Metzora - (Beraisa):</span> If the eighth day of Taharas Metzora fell on Erev Pesach, and he had an emission of semen on that day, he immerses and eats [Pesach at night]:</p></div>
<div class="indent3"><span class="nm">i.</span><p>Normally, a Tevul Yom may not enter the Ezras Nashim - in this case, he may (to stick his ear, thumb and big toe into the Azarah to complete his Taharah and enable him to bring Pesach);</p></div>
<div class="indent3"><span class="nm">ii.</span><p>[Machshirim for] an Ase with Kares (Pesach) override an Ase without Kares (that a Tevul Yom must leave the Ezras Nashim).</p></div>
<div class="indent2"><span class="nm">6.</span><p><span class="cl">(R. Yochanan):</span> Mid'Oraisa, there is not even an Ase (for a Tevul Yom to leave)!</p></div>
<div class="indent3"><span class="nm">i.</span><p><span class="cl">Question:</span> "Va'Ya'amod Yehoshafat...b'Veis Hash-m Lifnei he'Chatzer ha'Chadashah" - why is it called new?</p></div>
<div class="indent3"><span class="nm">ii.</span><p><span class="cl">Answer:</span> They made a new decree, that a Tevul Yom may not enter Machaneh Leviyah (i.e. Ezras Nashim).</p></div>
<div class="indent2"><span class="nm">7.</span><p><span class="cl">Beis ha'Peras - (Mishnah):</span> Beis Shamai and Beis Hillel agree that one may check a Beis ha'Peras (a field in which a grave was plowed, we are concerned that bones were dragged around) for one who wants to [go through to] bring Pesach, but not to eat Terumah. (Mid'Rabanan, a Beis ha'Peras is like a cemetery - to enable one to bring Pesach, we are lenient.)</p></div>
<div class="bbbline">92b----------------------------------------92b</p></div>
<div class="indent2"><span class="nm">8.</span><p><span class="cl">Question:</span> How does one check it?</p></div>
<div class="indent2"><span class="nm">9.</span><p><span class="cl">Answer (Rav Yehudah):</span> A person may walk through a Beis ha'Pras by bending down and blowing the dirt before each step [to clear away any small bones that might be there].</p></div>
<div class="indent2"><span class="nm">10.</span><p><span class="cl">(Rav Yehudah bar Ashi citing Rav Yehudah):</span> If many people walked through a Beis ha'Pras, it is Tahor (we assume that any bones have been crushed to less than the Shi'ur to Metamei, i.e. the size of a barley seed).</p></div>
<div class="perekline">PEREK MI SHE'HAYAH</div>
<div class="subject"><span class="nm">3)</span><p>IF PESACH WAS OFFERED FOR SOMEONE B'DERECH RECHOKAH</p></div>
<div class="indent1"><span class="nm">(a)</span><p><span class="cl">(Mishnah):</span> If one was Tamei or far away and did not bring Pesach Rishon, he brings Pesach Sheni;</p></div>
<div class="indent1"><span class="nm">(b)</span><p>If he did not bring Pesach Rishon b'Shogeg or b'Ones, he brings Pesach Sheni.</p></div>
<div class="indent1"><span class="nm">(c)</span><p><span class="cl">Question:</span> Since the law is the same, why does the Torah specify Tamei and Derech Rechokah?</p></div>
<div class="indent1"><span class="nm">(d)</span><p><span class="cl">Answer:</span> These are exempt from Kares, and these (this will be explained) are Chayavim.</p></div>
<div class="indent1"><span class="nm">(e)</span><p><span class="cl">(Gemara - Rav Nachman):</span> If one was far away and others slaughtered and did Zerikah for him [to come and eat at night], he fulfilled Pesach;</p></div>
<div class="indent2"><span class="nm">1.</span><p>The Torah is merciful on (exempts) one who was far away, but if he brought Pesach, he will be blessed!</p></div>
<div class="indent1"><span class="nm">(f)</span><p><span class="cl">(Rav Sheshes):</span> He was not Yotzei - he is precluded from Pesach, like a Tamei.</p></div>
<div class="indent1"><span class="nm">(g)</span><p><span class="cl">Support (Rav Nachman, for himself - Mishnah):</span> If one was Tamei or far away and did not bring Pesach Rishon, he brings Pesach Sheni.</p></div>
<div class="indent2"><span class="nm">1.</span><p><span class="cl">Inference:</span> If he wanted, he could have brought Pesach Rishon (this refers to Derech Rechokah - since he is exempt, we must discuss a Tamei who could not bring Pesach)!</p></div>
<div class="indent1"><span class="nm">(h)</span><p><span class="cl">Rejection (Rav Sheshes - Seifa):</span> If he was Shogeg or Ones and did not bring Pesach Rishon, he brings Pesach Sheni.</p></div>
<div class="indent2"><span class="nm">1.</span><p><span class="cl">Question:</span> Will you say that if he wanted, he could have brought Pesach Rishon - it says that he was Shogeg or Ones!</p></div>
<div class="indent2"><span class="nm">2.</span><p><span class="cl">Answer:</span> Rather, the Seifa discusses [without explicitly mentioning] Mezid with them (Shogeg and Ones);</p></div>
<div class="indent2"><span class="nm">3.</span><p>Likewise, the Reisha discusses Onen with them (Tamei and Derech Rechokah; the Onen could have offered if he wanted)!</p></div>
<div class="indent1"><span class="nm">(i)</span><p><span class="cl">Support (of rejection - Rav Ashi - Seifa):</span> These are exempt from Kares, and these are Chayavim.</p></div>
<div class="indent2"><span class="nm">1.</span><p><span class="cl">Question:</span> What case does this discuss?</p></div>
<div class="indent3"><span class="nm">i.</span><p>It does not discuss Shogeg or Ones - they are not Chayav Kares!</p></div>
<div class="indent2"><span class="nm">2.</span><p><span class="cl">Answer:</span> Rather, it discusses Mezid and Onen.</p></div>
<div class="indent1"><span class="nm">(j)</span><p><span class="cl">Rejection:</span> Rav Nachman can say that it only discuss Mezid;</p></div>
<div class="indent2"><span class="nm">1.</span><p>Really, it should say Chayav (singular) - it says Chayavim for parallel structure with the Reisha, which says Peturim.</p></div>
