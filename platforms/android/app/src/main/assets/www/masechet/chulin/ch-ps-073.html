<div class="subject"><span class="nm">1)</span><p>DOES THE FORBIDDEN LIMB BECOME NEVELAH?</p></div>
<div class="indent1"><span class="nm">(a)</span><p><span class="cl">Answer #2 (Ravina):</span> A Mishkav is not destined to be cut, but the limb of the fetus is destined to be cut (because it is forbidden);</p></div>
<div class="indent2"><span class="nm">1.</span><p>Anything destined to be cut is considered to be cut already.</p></div>
<div class="indent2"><span class="nm">2.</span><p><span class="cl">Suggestion:</span> This is like R. Meir;</p></div>
<div class="indent3"><span class="nm">i.</span><p><span class="cl">(Mishnah):</span> If a handle of a Kli is too long and is destined to be cut, when immersing the Kli, one must immerse as much of the handle as he will keep;</p></div>
<div class="indent3"><span class="nm">ii.</span><p>R. Yehudah says, the entire handle must be immersed.</p></div>
<div class="indent2"><span class="nm">3.</span><p><span class="cl">Rejection:</span> All agree regarding a fetus. Since foods are not strongly connected, we view them as if they were already cut.</p></div>
<div class="indent1"><span class="nm">(b)</span><p><span class="cl">Question:</span> According to Ula, we understand why the Mishnah said that the limb was cut. If not, the fetus would be Tahor;</p></div>
<div class="indent2"><span class="nm">1.</span><p>According to Ravina, even if the limb was not cut, the fetus is Tamei!</p></div>
<div class="indent1"><span class="nm">(c)</span><p><span class="cl">Answer:</span> Indeed, the Seifa says that it was cut merely for parallel structure to the Reisha.</p></div>
<div class="indent1"><span class="nm">(d)</span><p><span class="cl">(Mishnah):</span> The fetus is like something that touched a slaughtered Terefah.</p></div>
<div class="indent1"><span class="nm">(e)</span><p><span class="cl">Question:</span> A slaughtered Terefah is not Tamei!</p></div>
<div class="indent1"><span class="nm">(f)</span><p><span class="cl">Answer (Shmuel's father):</span> A slaughtered Terefah is Metamei Kodshim (mid'Rabanan).</p></div>
<div class="indent1"><span class="nm">(g)</span><p><span class="cl">(Mishnah):</span> We find that Shechitah of a Terefah inhibits Tum'as Nevelah. Similarly, Shechitah of the mother inhibits Tum'as Nevelah from a limb (that left the womb)!</p></div>
<div class="indent1"><span class="nm">(h)</span><p><span class="cl">(Beraisa - R. Meir):</span> If you say that Shechitah of the mother is Metaher the limb, it should also permit it (to be eaten)!</p></div>
<div class="indent1"><span class="nm">(i)</span><p><span class="cl">Chachamim:</span> It is easier to permit something that is not part of the slaughtered animal than something that is part of it.</p></div>
<div class="indent2"><span class="nm">1.</span><p>If part of the fetus was cut off (from the fetus) inside in the mother, Shechitah of the mother permits it. If the spleen or kidneys of the mother were cut off, they do not become permitted.</p></div>
<div class="indent1"><span class="nm">(j)</span><p><span class="cl">Question:</span> How does that answer R. Meir's question?</p></div>
<div class="indent1"><span class="nm">(k)</span><p><span class="cl">Answer (Rava):</span> The Beraisa is abbreviated. It means as follows:</p></div>
<div class="indent2"><span class="nm">1.</span><p><span class="cl">R. Meir:</span> If you say that Shechitah of the mother is Metaher the limb, it should also permit it!</p></div>
<div class="indent2"><span class="nm">2.</span><p><span class="cl">Chachamim:</span> We learn from a Terefah. Shechitah is Metaher it, but does not permit it.</p></div>
<div class="indent2"><span class="nm">3.</span><p><span class="cl">R. Meir:</span> Shechitah is Metaher the Terefah itself. You have no source that Shechitah of the mother is Metaher a limb (that is not part of the mother)!</p></div>
<div class="indent2"><span class="nm">4.</span><p><span class="cl">Chachamim:</span> Shechitah helps more for something that is not part of the slaughtered animal than for a part of it;</p></div>
<div class="indent3"><span class="nm">i.</span><p>If part of the fetus was cut inside in the mother, Shechitah of the mother permits it. If the spleen or kidneys of the mother were cut, they do not become permitted.</p></div>
<div class="indent1"><span class="nm">(l)</span><p><span class="cl">Support (for Rava - Beraisa - R. Meir):</span> If you say that Shechitah of the mother is Metaher the limb, it should also permit it!</p></div>
<div class="indent2"><span class="nm">1.</span><p><span class="cl">Chachamim:</span> We learn from a Terefah. Shechitah is Metaher it, but does not permit it.</p></div>
<div class="indent2"><span class="nm">2.</span><p><span class="cl">R. Meir:</span> Shechitah is Metaher the Terefah itself, or a dangling limb of an animal. You have no source that Shechitah of the mother is Metaher a limb (which is not part of the mother)!</p></div>

<div class="subject"><span class="nm">2)</span><p>WHEN IS A LIMB CONSIDERED TO HAVE FALLEN OFF?</p></div>
<div class="indent1"><span class="nm">(a)</span><p><span class="cl">Version #1 - (Reish Lakish):</span> R. Meir and Chachamim argue about a dangling limb just like they argue about the limb of the fetus.</p></div>
<div class="indent1"><span class="nm">(b)</span><p><span class="cl">(R. Yochanan):</span> They argue only about the fetus' limb, but all agree that Shechitah makes Nipul (makes a dangling limb Ever Min ha'Chai, as if it fell off in the animal's lifetime. It is Tamei.)</p></div>
<div class="indent2"><span class="nm">1.</span><p><span class="cl">(R. Yosi bar Chanina):</span> According to R. Yochanan, Chachamim say that Shechitah is Metaher the fetus' limb but not a dangling limb, because the former could have become permitted (had the fetus returned the limb to the womb before Shechitah), but the latter could not have.</p></div>
<div class="indent1"><span class="nm">(c)</span><p><span class="cl">Objection (Beraisa - R. Meir):</span> Shechitah is Metaher the Terefah itself, or a dangling limb. You have no source that Shechitah of the mother is Metaher the fetus' limb!</p></div>
<div class="bbbline">73b----------------------------------------73b</p></div>
<div class="indent2"><span class="nm">1.</span><p>According to Reish Lakish, we can say that R. Meir addresses Chachamim according to their reasoning;</p></div>
<div class="indent3"><span class="nm">i.</span><p>I hold that Shechitah is not Metaher the fetus' limb nor a dangling limb. Even if you say that it is Metaher a dangling limb, you have no source for the fetus' limb.</p></div>
<div class="indent2"><span class="nm">2.</span><p>We cannot explain the Beraisa according to R. Yochanan!</p></div>
<div class="indent1"><span class="nm">(d)</span><p>Rather, the Amora'im argue as follows.</p></div>
<div class="indent1"><span class="nm">(e)</span><p><span class="cl">Version #2 - (Reish Lakish):</span> R. Meir and Chachamim argue about a dangling limb just like they argue about the limb of the fetus.</p></div>
<div class="indent1"><span class="nm">(f)</span><p><span class="cl">(R. Yochanan):</span> They argue only about the fetus' limb, but all agree that Shechitah does not make Nipul.</p></div>
<div class="indent2"><span class="nm">1.</span><p><span class="cl">(R. Yosi bar Chanina):</span> According to R. Yochanan, R. Meir says that Shechitah is Metaher a dangling limb but not the fetus' limb, because the former is part of the animal slaughtered, but the latter is not. (End of Version #2)</p></div>
<div class="indent1"><span class="nm">(g)</span><p><span class="cl">(R. Yitzchak bar Yosef):</span> All agree that death (without Shechitah) makes Nipul, Shechitah does not make Nipul.</p></div>
<div class="indent1"><span class="nm">(h)</span><p><span class="cl">Question:</span> What limb does he refer to?</p></div>
<div class="indent2"><span class="nm">1.</span><p>It cannot be a fetus' limb that left the womb. They argue about this!</p></div>
<div class="indent1"><span class="nm">(i)</span><p><span class="cl">Answer:</span> He refers to a dangling limb.</p></div>
<div class="indent1"><span class="nm">(j)</span><p><span class="cl">Question:</span> Why must he teach this? We learn both of these from Mishnayos!</p></div>
<div class="indent2"><span class="nm">1.</span><p><span class="cl">(Mishnah #1 - R. Meir):</span> If an animal (with a dangling limb) dies, the meat cannot become Tamei until it is Huchshar (water falls on it). The limb has Tum'as Ever Min ha'Chai, but not Tum'as Nevelah.</p></div>
<div class="indent2"><span class="nm">2.</span><p><span class="cl">(Mishnah #2 - R. Meir):</span> If an animal (with a dangling limb and flesh) was slaughtered, (the limb and flesh are) Huchsheru (Lekabel Tum'ah, but it is not Ever Min ha'Chai);</p></div>
<div class="indent2"><span class="nm">3.</span><p>R. Shimon says, they are not Huchsheru.</p></div>
<div class="indent1"><span class="nm">(k)</span><p><span class="cl">Answer:</span> We could have understood Mishnah #2 differently, that R. Meir says that Shechitah makes Nipul (the limb becomes Ever Min ha'Chai), and the flesh is Huchshar.</p></div>
<div class="indent1"><span class="nm">(l)</span><p><span class="cl">Question:</span> It says 'Huchsheru' (plural)!</p></div>
<div class="indent1"><span class="nm">(m)</span><p><span class="cl">Answer:</span> This could refer to dangling flesh and meat that separated (after Shechitah) from a dangling limb.</p></div>
<div class="indent1"><span class="nm">(n)</span><p><span class="cl">Question:</span> Why must the Tana teach both? Surely the law of Hechsher is the same for both!</p></div>
<div class="indent1"><span class="nm">(o)</span><p><span class="cl">Answer:</span> One might have thought that since the limb is (after Shechitah) Ever Min ha'Chai, which has a severe Tum'ah, meat that separates from it does not need Hechsher. He teaches that this is not so.</p></div>
<div class="indent1"><span class="nm">(p)</span><p><span class="cl">(Rav Yosef):</span> Rabah bar bar Chanah supports R. Yitzchak bar Yosef.</p></div>
<div class="indent2"><span class="nm">1.</span><p><span class="cl">(Beraisa):</span> "Do not eat meat torn in the field" includes dangling limbs and flesh, in Behemos, Chayos and birds.</p></div>
<div class="indent2"><span class="nm">2.</span><p><span class="cl">(Rabah bar bar Chanah):</span> The Isur is only mid'Rabanan.</p></div>
