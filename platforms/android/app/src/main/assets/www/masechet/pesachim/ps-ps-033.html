<div class="subject"><span class="nm">1)</span><p>THE SHI'UR TO BE LIABLE FOR ME'ILAH</p></div>
<div class="indent1"><span class="nm">(a)</span><p><span class="cl">Question (Rav Papa):</span> This is not comforting - Rabah and Rav Sheshes found a flaw with it!</p></div>
<div class="indent2"><span class="nm">1.</span><p>This Beraisa is like Rebbi, who holds that one is Chayav Misah for Me'ilah:</p></div>
<div class="indent3"><span class="nm">i.</span><p><span class="cl">(Beraisa - Rebbi):</span> If one was Mo'el b'Mezid, he is Chayav Misah;</p></div>
<div class="indent3"><span class="nm">ii.</span><p>Chachamim say, he transgresses [only] a Lav.</p></div>
<div class="indent2"><span class="nm">2.</span><p><span class="cl">Question:</span> What is Rebbi's reason?</p></div>
<div class="indent2"><span class="nm">3.</span><p><span class="cl">Answer (R. Avahu):</span> He learns from a Gezerah Shavah "Chet-Chet" from a Tamei person who ate Terumah, who is Chayav Misah.</p></div>
<div class="indent2"><span class="nm">4.</span><p><span class="cl">Summation of question:</span> Similarly, the Gezeirah Shavah also teaches that just like one is Chayav Misah for a k'Zayis of Terumah, one is Chayav Misah for Me'ilah of a k'Zayis [unlike R. Chiya bar Avin, who is Mechayev Misah for Me'ilah of less than a k'Zayis! Also Chachamim learn [other things] from this Gezeirah Shavah - however, they expound "U'Mesu <i>Bo</i>" to teach that there is Misah for Terumah, but not for Me'ilah.]</p></div>
<div class="indent1"><span class="nm">(b)</span><p><span class="cl">Answer (and objection to Rabah and Rav Sheshes - Rav Papa):</span> [R. Chiya's answer is good! Why do] Rabah and Rav Sheshes assume that Rebbi holds like Chachamim - perhaps he holds like Aba Sha'ul [who obligates for less than a k'Zayis of Terumah]!</p></div>
<div class="indent1"><span class="nm">(c)</span><p><span class="cl">Question:</span> But Rav Papa said that Aba Sha'ul requires a Perutah and a k'Zayis!</p></div>
<div class="indent1"><span class="nm">(d)</span><p><span class="cl">Answer:</span> This shows that he retracted.</p></div>
<div class="indent1"><span class="nm">(e)</span><p><span class="cl">Answer #2 (to Question 2:r:5, 32B - Mar brei d'Ravina):</span> The Tana says that you cannot learn about Me'ilah from other Aveiros (Chayavei Kerisos), regarding which we do not equate lack of intent with intent:</p></div>
<div class="indent2"><span class="nm">1.</span><p>If one intended to cut something detached and cut something attached [on Shabbos], he is exempt.</p></div>
<div class="indent2"><span class="nm">2.</span><p>Regarding Me'ilah, lack of intent is like intent - if one intended to warm himself in Chulin shearings and warmed himself in shearings of an Olah, he was Mo'el!</p></div>
<div class="indent1"><span class="nm">(f)</span><p><span class="cl">Answer #3 (Rav Nachman bar Yitzchak):</span> You cannot learn about Me'ilah from other Aveiros, regarding which Mis'asek (one who intended for a permitted action, and transgressed) is not like intent [for a forbidden action], to Me'ilah, regarding which Mis'asek is like intent:</p></div>
<div class="indent2"><span class="nm">1.</span><p>If one intended to <i>lift</i> something detached and cut something attached [on Shabbos], he is exempt.</p></div>
<div class="indent2"><span class="nm">2.</span><p>If one stuck his hand into a Keli to take something and anointed his hand in Kodesh oil, he was Mo'el!</p></div>
<div class="subject"><span class="nm">2)</span><p>SEPARATING Terumah THAT MAY NOT BE EATEN</p></div>
<div class="indent1"><span class="nm">(a)</span><p><span class="cl">(Beraisa):</span> This applies to one who separated Terumah and then it became Chametz - but all agree that on Pesach, if one separated Chametz to be Terumah, it does not take effect.</p></div>
<div class="indent1"><span class="nm">(b)</span><p><span class="cl">Question:</span> What is the source of this?</p></div>
<div class="indent1"><span class="nm">(c)</span><p><span class="cl">Answer (Rav Nachman bar Yitzchak):</span> "Titen Lo" (to the Kohen) - do not give [Terumah which he cannot eat, e.g. Tamei Terumah, which will be fuel] for his fire (all the more so, do not give something he cannot use at all)!</p></div>
<div class="indent1"><span class="nm">(d)</span><p><span class="cl">Question (Rav Huna brei d'Rav Yehoshua - Beraisa):</span> One may not separate Tamei produce to be Terumah on (to exempt) Tahor produce;</p></div>
<div class="indent2"><span class="nm">1.</span><p>If this was done b'Shogeg, it becomes Terumah.</p></div>
<div class="indent2"><span class="nm">2.</span><p>We should say "Titen Lo" - not for his fire!</p></div>
<div class="indent1"><span class="nm">(e)</span><p><span class="cl">Answer:</span> Tamei Terumah was once fit [before it was Tamei] - the Chametz was never fit.</p></div>
<div class="indent1"><span class="nm">(f)</span><p><span class="cl">Question:</span> In what case was Chametz never fit to be Terumah?</p></div>
<div class="indent1"><span class="nm">(g)</span><p><span class="cl">Answer:</span> It became Chametz while it was attached. (Kovetz Shi'urim - when grain is ready to be harvested it can become Chametz, but it cannot become Terumah until it is detached.)</p></div>
<div class="indent1"><span class="nm">(h)</span><p><span class="cl">Question:</span> If it did not become Chametz until it was detached, will you say that it becomes Terumah?!</p></div>
<div class="indent1"><span class="nm">(i)</span><p><span class="cl">Answer #1 (Rav Nachman bar Yitzchak):</span> Yes! Chachamim of the Beis Medrash also say so!</p></div>
<div class="indent1"><span class="nm">(j)</span><p><span class="cl">Answer #2 (Rav Huna brei d'Rav Yehoshua):</span> Even if it did not become Chametz until it was detached, it does not become Terumah;</p></div>
<div class="bbbline">33b----------------------------------------33b</p></div>
<div class="indent2"><span class="nm">1.</span><p>Terumah must be "Reishis" (first) such that the remainder is discernibly for Yisrael - here, this is not true (it is all forbidden).</p></div>
<div class="subject"><span class="nm">3)</span><p>JUICE INSIDE FRUITS</p></div>
<div class="indent1"><span class="nm">(a)</span><p><span class="cl">(Rav Acha bar Rav Avya citing R. Yochanan):</span> If grapes became Tamei, one may stomp less than k'Beitzah [at a time - this is the Shi'ur for Tum'as Ochlim], the wine may be used for Nesachim (wine offerings, for it is Tahor).</p></div>
<div class="indent1"><span class="nm">(b)</span><p><span class="cl">Inference:</span> He holds that juice inside a fruit is 'deposited' (it is not considered part of the fruit);</p></div>
<div class="indent2"><span class="nm">1.</span><p>The juice is not Mekabel Tum'ah until it leaves (only then it is considered a liquid) - at that time, there is not a Shi'ur (of grapes - a k'Beitzah of solid food is needed to Metamei something else)!</p></div>
<div class="indent1"><span class="nm">(c)</span><p><span class="cl">Question:</span> If so, it should be Tahor even if he stomps exactly k'Beitzah!</p></div>
<div class="indent2"><span class="nm">1.</span><p><span class="cl">(Mishnah):</span> If a Tamei Mes squeezed exactly k'Beitzah of olives or grapes, they are Tehorim.</p></div>
<div class="indent1"><span class="nm">(d)</span><p><span class="cl">Answer:</span> That is b'Di'eved - l'Chatchilah, one may not do so, lest he stomp more than k'Beitzah.</p></div>
<div class="indent1"><span class="nm">(e)</span><p><span class="cl">Objection (Rav Chisda):</span> We cannot accept your Halachah - where did the Tum'ah go?!</p></div>
<div class="indent1"><span class="nm">(f)</span><p><span class="cl">Inference:</span> He holds that juice is considered part of the fruit, it became Tamei along with the fruit.</p></div>
<div class="indent1"><span class="nm">(g)</span><p><span class="cl">Question (Rav Acha):</span> You must agree that the juice is deposited!</p></div>
<div class="indent2"><span class="nm">1.</span><p><span class="cl">(Mishnah):</span> If a Tamei Mes squeezed exactly k'Beitzah of olives or grapes, they are Tehorim.</p></div>
<div class="indent2"><span class="nm">2.</span><p>We understand this if juice is deposited - but if it is part of the fruit, it became Tamei along with the fruit once he touched the fruit!</p></div>
<div class="indent1"><span class="nm">(h)</span><p><span class="cl">Answer:</span> No - the case is, the fruits were not Huchshar to Mekabel Tum'ah.</p></div>
<div class="indent2"><span class="nm">1.</span><p>They are not Huchshar until he squeezes them (the juice that leaves is Machshir the fruit) - at that time, less than a Shi'ur remains (k'Beitzah is also the Shi'ur for a solid to Mekabel Hechsher or Tum'ah - see Tosfos).</p></div>
<div class="indent1"><span class="nm">(i)</span><p><span class="cl">Support (Beraisa):</span> ...This is like Tamei Terumah of strawberries and grapes, which may not be eaten and do not burn.</p></div>
<div class="indent2"><span class="nm">1.</span><p>If the juice inside is not Nitma, one may squeeze out the juice [less than k'Beitzah at a time] and drink it!</p></div>
<div class="indent1"><span class="nm">(j)</span><p><span class="cl">Rejection (Rava):</span> No - Chachamim forbid on account of Takalah [lest one eat the fruits while squeezing them, which is commonly done - Maharam Chalavah. Rav Acha and the Mishnah permit regarding Chulin.]</p></div>
<div class="indent1"><span class="nm">(k)</span><p><span class="cl">Question (Abaye):</span> We are not concerned for Takalah!</p></div>
<div class="indent2"><span class="nm">1.</span><p><span class="cl">(Beraisa):</span> One may use Tamei Terumah bread or oil for fuel [even though one does not use much at a time]!</p></div>
<div class="indent2"><span class="nm">2.</span><p><span class="cl">Answer (Rava):</span> The case is, he puts the bread amidst wood and puts the oil in a disgusting Keli [no one will eat it].</p></div>
<div class="indent1"><span class="nm">(l)</span><p><span class="cl">(Beraisa):</span> One may use Tamei Terumah bread or oil for fuel [even though it will be used over the course of a long time]!</p></div>
<div class="indent1"><span class="nm">(m)</span><p><span class="cl">(Abaye and Rava):</span> This is permitted with bread, but not with wheat, on account of Takalah (wheat does not become repulsive even if it is amidst wood).</p></div>
<div class="indent1"><span class="nm">(n)</span><p><span class="cl">(R. Yochanan):</span> It is permitted even with wheat.</p></div>
<div class="indent1"><span class="nm">(o)</span><p><span class="cl">Question:</span> We should be concerned for Takalah!</p></div>
<div class="indent1"><span class="nm">(p)</span><p><span class="cl">Answer:</span> He does like Rav Ashi answered [elsewhere] - he makes it repulsive by cooking it [before throwing it amidst wood].</p></div>
