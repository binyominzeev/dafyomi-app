<div class="indent1"><span class="nm">(a)</span><p><span class="cl">Answer (Rava):</span> R. Ami is Mechayev here (Rashi - even though he merely left it; Tosfos - only if he moved the Se'or around in the dough), just like one is liable for roasting on Shabbos (when he turned it over.)</p></div>
<div class="indent1"><span class="nm">(b)</span><p><span class="cl">(Rabah bar bar Chanah):</span> If one left meat over coals and turned over the meat, he is liable. If he did not turn it over, he is exempt.</p></div>
<div class="indent1"><span class="nm">(c)</span><p><span class="cl">Question:</span> If the meat will not get cooked if he does not turn it over, this is obvious!</p></div>
<div class="indent1"><span class="nm">(d)</span><p><span class="cl">Answer #1:</span> The meat will get cooked even if he does not turn it over.</p></div>
<div class="indent1"><span class="nm">(e)</span><p><span class="cl">Rejection:</span> If so, he should be liable even if he does not turn it over!</p></div>
<div class="indent1"><span class="nm">(f)</span><p><span class="cl">Answer #2:</span> If he does not turn it over, the meat will get cooked like Ma'achal Ben Drusai (food that was minimally cooked, i.e. a third or half-cooked) on one side. (The other side will get cooked even less). If he turns it over, it will get cooked k'Ma'achal Ben Drusai on both sides;</p></div>
<div class="indent2"><span class="nm">1.</span><p>Rabah teaches that cooking k'Ma'achal Ben Drusai on one side is insignificant.</p></div>
<div class="indent1"><span class="nm">(g)</span><p><span class="cl">Version #1 (Rava):</span> If k'Grogeres (the volume of a fig) becomes roasted on one side in one place, he is liable.</p></div>
<div class="indent1"><span class="nm">(h)</span><p><span class="cl">Question (Ravina):</span> This implies that if the k'Grogeres is in two or three places, he is exempt! (This is not true!)</p></div>
<div class="indent2"><span class="nm">1.</span><p><span class="cl">(Mishnah):</span> One who drills a hole of any size is liable.</p></div>
<div class="indent2"><span class="nm">2.</span><p><span class="cl">Question:</span> What is the case?</p></div>
<div class="indent3"><span class="nm">i.</span><p>If the hole is in one place, it is useless! (Surely, he is exempt.)</p></div>
<div class="indent2"><span class="nm">3.</span><p><span class="cl">Answer #1:</span> Rather, it is in two or three places. It is possible to join the holes (to make a long hole.)</p></div>
<div class="indent1"><span class="nm">(i)</span><p><span class="cl">Answer (and Answer #2 to Question (2) - Rav Ashi):</span> Really, the hole is in one place. It is on the base of a key. A tooth can be inserted.</p></div>
<div class="indent1"><span class="nm">(j)</span><p><span class="cl">Version #2 (Rava):</span> If k'Grogeres becomes roasted, even in two or three places, he is liable.</p></div>

<div class="subject"><span class="nm">2)</span><p>THE LAV TO BE MECHAMETZ THE MENACHOS</p></div>
<div class="indent1"><span class="nm">(a)</span><p><span class="cl">(Beraisa):</span> Had it said "Asher Takrivu la'Shem Lo Se'aseh Chametz", we would know only that there is a Lav for fermenting the Kometz;</p></div>
<div class="indent2"><span class="nm">1.</span><p><span class="cl">Question:</span> What is the source that there is a Lav for the entire Minchah (before Kemitzah)?</p></div>
<div class="indent2"><span class="nm">2.</span><p><span class="cl">Answer:</span> It says "(ha')Minchah (Asher Takrivu...)"</p></div>
<div class="indent2"><span class="nm">3.</span><p><span class="cl">Question:</span> (This verse refers to Marcheshes.) What is the source for other Menachos?</p></div>
<div class="indent2"><span class="nm">4.</span><p><span class="cl">Answer:</span> It says "Kol ha'Minchah..."</p></div>
<div class="indent2"><span class="nm">5.</span><p>"Asher Takrivu la'Shem" teaches that the Lav applies only to Menachos Kosher to be offered, but not to Pesulim;</p></div>
<div class="indent3"><span class="nm">i.</span><p>This teaches that one who ferments a Kosher Minchah is liable, but one who ferments a Pasul Minchah is exempt.</p></div>
<div class="indent1"><span class="nm">(b)</span><p><span class="cl">Question (Rav Papa):</span> If one fermented and again fermented after it left the Azarah, is he liable also for the second time?</p></div>
<div class="indent2"><span class="nm">1.</span><p>Once it left the Azarah, it is Pasul, he is exempt (for future Chimutz);</p></div>
<div class="indent2"><span class="nm">2.</span><p>Or, since it was already Pasul once it became Chametz, leaving the Azarah has no effect (so Mechametz after Mechametz is liable)!</p></div>
<div class="indent1"><span class="nm">(c)</span><p>This question is not resolved.</p></div>
<div class="indent1"><span class="nm">(d)</span><p><span class="cl">Question (Rav Mari):</span> If one fermented a Minchah on top of the Mizbe'ach, what is the law?</p></div>
<div class="indent2"><span class="nm">1.</span><p>"Asher Takrivu" does not apply, for it was already brought on the Mizbe'ach;</p></div>
<div class="indent2"><span class="nm">2.</span><p>Or, since it was not Huktar yet, it is as if Hakravah was not yet done!</p></div>
<div class="indent1"><span class="nm">(e)</span><p>This question is not resolved.</p></div>
<div class="indent1"><span class="nm">(f)</span><p><span class="cl">Question:</span> Since we learn (liability for the whole Minchah) from "Kol ha'Minchah", what do we learn from  "Asher Takrivu (la'Shem)"?</p></div>
<div class="indent1"><span class="nm">(g)</span><p><span class="cl">Answer (Beraisa - R. Yosi ha'Galili):</span> "Asher Takrivu" includes Minchas Nesachim. (One may not ferment it);</p></div>
<div class="indent1"><span class="nm">(h)</span><p>R. Akiva says, it (Tosfos - also) includes Lechem ha'Panim.</p></div>
<div class="indent1"><span class="nm">(i)</span><p><span class="cl">Question:</span> Minchas Nesachim is kneaded only with oil. Flour with fruit juice (without water) will never ferment!</p></div>
<div class="bbbline">57b----------------------------------------57b</p></div>
<div class="indent1"><span class="nm">(j)</span><p><span class="cl">Answer (Reish Lakish):</span> R. Yosi ha'Galili holds that one may knead Minchas Nesachim (also) with water, and it is Kosher.</p></div>
<div class="subject"><span class="nm">3)</span><p>ARE MEASURING KELIM MEKADESH?</p></div>
<div class="indent1"><span class="nm">(a)</span><p><span class="cl">Question:</span> The Soles for Lechem ha'Panim is measured in a Kli for dry measures. R. Akiva holds that dry measures were not Niskadshu. They are not Mekadesh their contents! (How can one be liable for Mechametz? Lechem ha'Panim is not Kodesh until it is baked, and then it is already Matzah, so it cannot become Chametz!)</p></div>
<div class="indent1"><span class="nm">(b)</span><p><span class="cl">Answer (Ravin citing R. Yochanan):</span> The opinions must be switched. R. Akiva includes Minchas Nesachim, and R. Yosi includes (also) Lechem ha'Panim.</p></div>
<div class="indent1"><span class="nm">(c)</span><p>This is like R. Yochanan holds elsewhere;</p></div>
<div class="indent2"><span class="nm">1.</span><p><span class="cl">(R. Yochanan):</span> R. Yosi ha'Gelili and a Talmid of R. Yishmael (R. Yoshiyah) agree with each other.</p></div>
<div class="indent2"><span class="nm">2.</span><p><span class="cl">(Beraisa - R. Yoshiyah):</span> "Va'Yimshachem va'Ykadesh Osam" - the wet measures were anointed with oil on the inside and outside (so they are Mekadesh whatever touches them from either side). The dry measures were anointed only on the inside;</p></div>
<div class="indent2"><span class="nm">3.</span><p>R. Yonason says, the wet measures were anointed only on the inside. The dry measures were not anointed at all;</p></div>
<div class="indent2"><span class="nm">4.</span><p><span class="cl">Support (R. Yonason, for himself):</span> Regarding Shtei ha'Lechem it says "Chametz Te'afenah Bikurim la'Shem." They are "la'Shem" (fully Kodesh) only after they are baked. This shows that the dry measure was not Mekadesh them.</p></div>
<div class="indent1"><span class="nm">(d)</span><p><span class="cl">Question:</span> What do R. Yoshiyah and R. Yonason argue about?</p></div>
<div class="indent1"><span class="nm">(e)</span><p><span class="cl">Answer:</span> They argue about how to expound "Osam";</p></div>
<div class="indent2"><span class="nm">1.</span><p>R. Yoshiyah says that "Osam" excludes the outside of dry measures;</p></div>
<div class="indent2"><span class="nm">2.</span><p>R. Yonason says that dry measures are Chulin. We do not need a verse to exclude them. The verse excludes the outside of wet measures.</p></div>
<div class="indent1"><span class="nm">(f)</span><p><span class="cl">Question:</span> Why didn't R. Yochanan say also that R. Akiva and a Talmid of R. Yishmael (R. Yonason) agree with each other (that dry measures were not Niskadshos)?</p></div>
<div class="indent1"><span class="nm">(g)</span><p><span class="cl">Answer:</span> R. Akiva and R. Yonason disagree about wet measures. (R. Yonason says that only the inside is Mekudash. R. Akiva holds that also the outside is Mekudash.)</p></div>
<div class="indent1"><span class="nm">(h)</span><p><span class="cl">Question (Rav Papa):</span> Why are Shtei ha'Lechem not Kodesh until they are baked? They are kneaded in a Bisa (a wet measure!)</p></div>
<div class="indent1"><span class="nm">(i)</span><p><span class="cl">Answer (Abaye):</span> The verse discusses when they were kneaded on a hide.</p></div>
<div class="indent1"><span class="nm">(j)</span><p><span class="cl">Question:</span> If so, R. Yonason has no proof that dry measures are not Mekadesh. Perhaps the verse discusses when the Soles was measured in a Chulin Isaron!</p></div>
<div class="indent1"><span class="nm">(k)</span><p><span class="cl">Answer:</span> The Torah did not command to make a Bisa (kneading bowl), so it is reasonable that the verse discusses when a Bisa was not used;</p></div>
<div class="indent2"><span class="nm">1.</span><p>The Torah commands to make an Isaron measure. Surely it does not discuss when a Chulin Kli was used in place of Kodesh!</p></div>
<div class="subject"><span class="nm">4)</span><p>FORBIDDEN HAKTARAH</p></div>
<div class="indent1"><span class="nm">(a)</span><p><span class="cl">(Beraisa) Question:</span> What is the source that one is liable for Haktarah of any of the following?</p></div>
<div class="indent2"><span class="nm">1.</span><p>Meat of Chatas, Asham, other Kodshei Kodoshim (that are eaten, i.e. Shalmei Tzibur), or Kodshim Kalim;</p></div>
<div class="indent2"><span class="nm">2.</span><p>The Shirayim of the Omer, Shirei Shtei ha'Lechem (this will be explained), Lechem ha'Panim, or Shirei Menachos?</p></div>
<div class="indent1"><span class="nm">(b)</span><p><span class="cl">Answer:</span> "Ki Chol Se'or v'Chol Devash Lo Saktiru Mimenu Korban Isheh la'Shem"- anything that is partially Huktar, one may not be Maktir the rest.</p></div>
<div class="indent1"><span class="nm">(c)</span><p><span class="cl">Question:</span> No part of Shtei ha'Lechem or Lechem ha'Panim is offered!</p></div>
<div class="indent2"><span class="nm">1.</span><p><span class="cl">(Beraisa):</span> Shtei ha'Lechem and Lechem ha'Panim are excluded (from Hagashah) because no part of them is offered.</p></div>
<div class="indent1"><span class="nm">(d)</span><p><span class="cl">Answer (Rav Sheshes):</span> The Beraisa means that no part of them themselves is offered. (The Lav of Haktaras 'Mimenu l'Ishim' applies to them, for they have Matirim that are offered, i.e. Kivsei Atzeres and frankincense.)</p></div>
<div class="indent1"><span class="nm">(e)</span><p><span class="cl">(R. Yochanan):</span> If one brought any of these (Shirayim that it is forbidden to be Maktir) onto the ramp, he is liable;</p></div>
<div class="indent1"><span class="nm">(f)</span><p><span class="cl">(R. Elazar):</span> He is exempt.</p></div>
<div class="indent1"><span class="nm">(g)</span><p>R. Yochanan learns from the following Beraisa:</p></div>
<div class="indent2"><span class="nm">1.</span><p><span class="cl">(Beraisa):</span> "Ha'Mizbe'ach" teaches that one is liable for bringing these onto the Mizbe'ach;</p></div>
<div class="indent2"><span class="nm">2.</span><p><span class="cl">Question:</span> What is the source to obligate for bringing onto the ramp?</p></div>
<div class="indent2"><span class="nm">3.</span><p><span class="cl">Answer:</span> "V'El ha'Mizbe'ach Lo Ya'alu l'Re'ach Nicho'ach." (Our text, 'l'Ratzon', is mistaken.)</p></div>
<div class="indent1"><span class="nm">(h)</span><p>R. Elazar learns from "Ki Chol Se'or v'Chol Devash... Korban Reishis Taktiru Osam la'Shem." Only regarding Se'or and Devash, the ramp is like the Mizbe'ach.</p></div>
