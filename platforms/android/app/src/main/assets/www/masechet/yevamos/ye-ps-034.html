<div class="subject"><span class="nm">1)</span><p>MANY CHATA'OS FOR ONE ACTION</p></div>
<div class="indent1"><span class="nm">(a)</span><p><span class="cl">Question:</span> Our Tana holds that Isur Chal Al Isur regarding Isur Kolel (the latter Isur forbids also other matters), Isur Mosif (it forbids the forbidden matters to more people or in more ways) and Isur Bas Achas (two Isurim that take effect simultaneously). Like whom is this?</p></div>
<div class="indent1"><span class="nm">(b)</span><p><span class="cl">Answer #1 (Rav Yehudah):</span> It is R. Meir.</p></div>
<div class="indent2"><span class="nm">1.</span><p><span class="cl">(Beraisa):</span> One can bring four Chata'os and one Asham for one Achilah, e.g. a Tamei who ate on Yom Kipur Chelev (forbidden fats) that was Nosar (past the allowed time) from a Korban;</p></div>
<div class="indent2"><span class="nm">2.</span><p>R. Meir says, if it was Shabbos, and he took the food in his mouth from a Reshus ha'Yachid to a Reshus ha'Rabim, he is also liable for this!</p></div>
<div class="indent2"><span class="nm">3.</span><p><span class="cl">Chachamim:</span> That is not relevant to liability for eating.</p></div>
<div class="indent2"><span class="nm">4.</span><p><span class="cl">Question:</span> Like whom does R. Meir hold?</p></div>
<div class="indent3"><span class="nm">i.</span><p>He is unlike R. Yehoshua, who exempts from Chatas one who mistakenly errs while engaging in a Mitzvah!</p></div>
<div class="indent2"><span class="nm">5.</span><p><span class="cl">Answer #1:</span> He holds like R. Eliezer.</p></div>
<div class="indent2"><span class="nm">6.</span><p><span class="cl">Answer #2:</span> He can hold even like R. Yehoshua:</p></div>
<div class="indent3"><span class="nm">i.</span><p>R. Yehoshua exempts one who circumcised the wrong child on Shabbos, since he is frenzied to do the Mitzvah in time. In our case, he is not rushed.</p></div>
<div class="indent2"><span class="nm">7.</span><p><span class="cl">Question:</span> There is no time pressure regarding Terumah, yet R. Yehoshua exempts!</p></div>
<div class="indent3"><span class="nm">i.</span><p><span class="cl">(Mishnah):</span> If a Kohen was eating Terumah and learned that his mother was divorced or did Chalitzah (i.e. he is a Chalal; he lacks Kedushas Kehunah), R. Eliezer obligates him to pay principal and a fifth (the fine for a Zar who ate Terumah);</p></div>
<div class="indent3"><span class="nm">ii.</span><p>R. Yehoshua exempts.</p></div>
<div class="indent2"><span class="nm">8.</span><p><span class="cl">Answer (Rav Bivi bar Abaye):</span> The case is, he was eating (Chametz) Terumah on Erev Pesach, when there is time pressure.</p></div>
<div class="indent1"><span class="nm">(c)</span><p><span class="cl">Answer #2:</span> It suffices to say that our Tana holds that Isur Chal Al Isur when they are Bas Achas, like R. Shimon.</p></div>
<div class="indent1"><span class="nm">(d)</span><p><span class="cl">Question:</span> Granted, the Isurim of Eshes Ish, Eshes Ach and Achos Ishto come simultaneously if the brothers made one Shali'ach to Mekadesh, the sisters made one Shali'ach to receive Kidushin, and the Kidushin moneys were given together.</p></div>
<div class="indent2"><span class="nm">1.</span><p>However, how can the Isurim of Nidah come simultaneously with the other Isurim?</p></div>
<div class="indent1"><span class="nm">(e)</span><p><span class="cl">Answer (Rav Amram):</span> They were Nidah when the boys became (adults, at) 13, so the boys' Isurim came simultaneously;</p></div>
<div class="indent2"><span class="nm">1.</span><p>The girls were Nidah when they became 12, so their Isurim came simultaneously.</p></div>
<div class="subject"><span class="nm">2)</span><p>CAN A GIRL GET PREGNANT FROM BI'AH RISHONAH?</p></div>
<div class="indent1"><span class="nm">(a)</span><p><span class="cl">(Mishnah):</span> We separate them (lest they are pregnant)...</p></div>
<div class="indent1"><span class="nm">(b)</span><p><span class="cl">Question:</span> A woman cannot become pregnant from her first Bi'ah!</p></div>
<div class="indent1"><span class="nm">(c)</span><p><span class="cl">Answer (Rav Nachman):</span> They had Bi'ah twice.</p></div>
<div class="indent1"><span class="nm">(d)</span><p><span class="cl">Question:</span> R. Chiya taught that 16 Korbanos Chatas are brought. If they had Bi'ah twice, there would be 32!</p></div>
<div class="indent2"><span class="nm">1.</span><p><span class="cl">Counter-question:</span> You must agree that according to R. Eliezer, who is Mechayev for each pleasurable action during Bi'ah, they are liable more than 16!</p></div>
<div class="indent2"><span class="nm">2.</span><p><span class="cl">Answer:</span> You must say that we count only the Chata'os for the first act.</p></div>
<div class="indent1"><span class="nm">(e)</span><p><span class="cl">Answer:</span> Likewise, we count only for the first Bi'ah!</p></div>
<div class="bbbline">34b----------------------------------------34b</p></div>
<div class="indent1"><span class="nm">(f)</span><p><span class="cl">Question (Rava):</span> Tamar became pregnant from her first Bi'ah!</p></div>
<div class="indent1"><span class="nm">(g)</span><p><span class="cl">Answer (Rav Nachman):</span> She enabled this through crushing her Besulim with her finger.</p></div>
<div class="indent2"><span class="nm">1.</span><p><span class="cl">(R. Yitzchak):</span> All girls of Rebbi's house who did this were called Tamar.</p></div>
<div class="indent1"><span class="nm">(h)</span><p><span class="cl">Question:</span> Her first Bi'ah was not with Yehudah. She had previously married Er and Onan!</p></div>
<div class="indent1"><span class="nm">(i)</span><p><span class="cl">Answer:</span> Er and Onan had Bi'ah she'Lo k'Darkah (in the anus) with her.</p></div>
<div class="indent1"><span class="nm">(j)</span><p><span class="cl">Question (Beraisa - R. Eliezer):</span> All 24 months (of nursing), her husband spills the semen outside (lest pregnancy cause premature weaning and death of the baby).</p></div>
<div class="indent2"><span class="nm">1.</span><p><span class="cl">Chachamim:</span> This is like Er and Onan (it is forbidden)!</p></div>
<div class="indent1"><span class="nm">(k)</span><p><span class="cl">Answer:</span> It is like them in one respect, unlike them in another.</p></div>
<div class="indent2"><span class="nm">1.</span><p>It is like them regarding "V'Shiches Artzah" (wasting seed);</p></div>
<div class="indent2"><span class="nm">2.</span><p>It is unlike them regarding Lo k'Darkah. The Beraisa discusses Bi'ah k'Darkah.</p></div>
<div class="indent1"><span class="nm">(l)</span><p><span class="cl">Question:</span> The above verse teaches about Onan. How do we know that Er did so?</p></div>
<div class="indent1"><span class="nm">(m)</span><p><span class="cl">Answer (Rav Nachman bar Yitzchak):</span> "(Hash-m) killed also him" - he died for the same sin.</p></div>
<div class="indent1"><span class="nm">(n)</span><p><span class="cl">Question:</span> Granted, Onan did so because he knew that the child would not be considered his (but rather, like his brother's). However, why did Er do so?</p></div>
<div class="indent1"><span class="nm">(o)</span><p><span class="cl">Answer:</span> He did not want her beauty to be diminished through pregnancy.</p></div>
<div class="indent1"><span class="nm">(p)</span><p><span class="cl">(Beraisa - R. Yehudah):</span> "(When a man has Bi'ah) <i>Osah</i> (with her, they become Temei'im)" - this excludes a Kalah (the first Bi'ah is not Metamei);</p></div>
<div class="indent1"><span class="nm">(q)</span><p>Chachamim say, this excludes Bi'ah she'Lo k'Darkah.</p></div>
<div class="indent2"><span class="nm">1.</span><p><span class="cl">Suggestion (Hon, Rav Nachman' son):</span> R. Yehudah holds that the Torah was concerned for a Kalah's make-up! (She may even touch Tahor food without Tevilah. Even though the Torah allows a Chatzitzah on the minority of the body, Tevilah would wash away her make-up.)</p></div>
<div class="indent2"><span class="nm">2.</span><p><span class="cl">Rejection (Rav Nachman):</span> No, it is because she cannot become pregnant from Bi'ah Rishonah.</p></div>
<div class="indent1"><span class="nm">(r)</span><p><span class="cl">Question:</span> What is the source of the dispute?</p></div>
<div class="indent1"><span class="nm">(s)</span><p><span class="cl">Answer:</span> Chachamim expound "Shichvas Zera" - to exclude Ha'ara'ah (the first stage of Bi'ah); "Osah" excludes she'Lo k'Darkah;</p></div>
<div class="indent2"><span class="nm">1.</span><p>R. Yehudah excludes both of these from "Shichvas Zera". "Osah" excludes a Kalah.</p></div>
<div class="subject"><span class="nm">3)</span><p>BEING UNMARRIED CAN CAUSE STERILITY</p></div>
<div class="indent1"><span class="nm">(a)</span><p><span class="cl">(Ravin):</span> If a woman was 10 years without a husband after she was once married, she will not give birth.</p></div>
<div class="indent1"><span class="nm">(b)</span><p><span class="cl">(Rav Nachman):</span> If she was planning to remarry, she can become pregnant.</p></div>
<div class="indent1"><span class="nm">(c)</span><p>(Rava married Bas Rav Chisda more than 10 years after she was widowed.)</p></div>
<div class="indent1"><span class="nm">(d)</span><p><span class="cl">Rava (to her):</span> Chachamim suspect you (that you had Zenus in the interim, and this preserved your fertility)!</p></div>
<div class="indent1"><span class="nm">(e)</span><p><span class="cl">His wife:</span> I was planning to marry you.</p></div>
<div class="indent1"><span class="nm">(f)</span><p><span class="cl">A woman (to Rav Yosef):</span> I waited 10 years before remarrying, and I gave birth!</p></div>
<div class="indent1"><span class="nm">(g)</span><p><span class="cl">Rav Yosef:</span> Do not discredit the sages' words!</p></div>
<div class="indent2"><span class="nm">1.</span><p>She admitted that she had had Bi'ah with a Nochri in the interim.</p></div>
<div class="subject"><span class="nm">4)</span><p>WHO MUST WAIT BEFORE MARRYING?</p></div>
<div class="indent1"><span class="nm">(a)</span><p><span class="cl">Version #1 (Shmuel):</span> Any woman who had Bi'ah must wait three months before marrying someone else (to avoid doubts about who the father is if she will gave birth nine months later), except for a minor who converted or was freed from slavery;</p></div>
<div class="indent1"><span class="nm">(b)</span><p>A minor Yisraelis must wait.</p></div>
<div class="indent1"><span class="nm">(c)</span><p><span class="cl">Question:</span> What is the case?</p></div>
<div class="indent1"><span class="nm">(d)</span><p><span class="cl">Answer #1:</span> She did Mi'un (to leave a mid'Rabanan marriage).</p></div>
<div class="indent1"><span class="nm">(e)</span><p><span class="cl">Rejection:</span> Shmuel says that she need not wait after Mi'un!</p></div>
<div class="indent1"><span class="nm">(f)</span><p><span class="cl">Answer #2:</span> She was divorced.</p></div>
<div class="indent1"><span class="nm">(g)</span><p>Shmuel already taught that she must wait!</p></div>
<div class="indent2"><span class="nm">1.</span><p><span class="cl">(Shmuel):</span> If a minor did Mi'un, she need not wait three months. If he gave her a Get, she must wait.</p></div>
<div class="indent1"><span class="nm">(h)</span><p><span class="cl">Answer:</span> She was Mezaneh.</p></div>
