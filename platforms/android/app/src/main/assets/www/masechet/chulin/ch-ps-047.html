<div class="indent1"><span class="nm">(a)</span><p><span class="cl">(Rava):</span> If two adjacent abscesses are found, it does not help to check.</p></div>
<div class="indent2"><span class="nm">1.</span><p>If one abscess appears like two, we puncture one side of it. If the pus moves from one side to the other, this shows that it is a single abscess, it is Kosher;</p></div>
<div class="indent2"><span class="nm">2.</span><p>If not, it is two abscesses, it is Tereifah.</p></div>
<div class="indent1"><span class="nm">(b)</span><p><span class="cl">(Rava):</span> There are five chambers in the lungs, three on the right, and two on the left;</p></div>
<div class="indent2"><span class="nm">1.</span><p>If there are fewer or more than this, or if they are out of place, it is Tereifah.</p></div>
<div class="indent1"><span class="nm">(c)</span><p>An animal with an extra chamber was brought in front of Mereimar. He ruled that it is Kosher.</p></div>
<div class="indent2"><span class="nm">1.</span><p>Rav Acha told the owner to ask Mereimar to look again.</p></div>
<div class="indent2"><span class="nm">2.</span><p><span class="cl">Mareimar:</span> The Halachah is not like Rava regarding an extra chamber.</p></div>
<div class="indent3"><span class="nm">i.</span><p>This is only if the extra chamber is in line with the others. If not, it is Tereifah.</p></div>
<div class="indent1"><span class="nm">(d)</span><p>An animal with an extra chamber (not in line with the others) was brought in front of Rav Ashi. He was about to rule that it is Tereifah.</p></div>
<div class="indent2"><span class="nm">1.</span><p><span class="cl">Rav Huna bar Mar Avya:</span> All healthy (alternatively - self-grazing) animals have this. Butchers call it the rose (colored) mini-chamber.</p></div>
<div class="indent3"><span class="nm">i.</span><p>This is only if the extra chamber is inside the others. If it is outside, even if it is no bigger than a myrtle leaf it is Tereifah.</p></div>

<div class="subject"><span class="nm">2)</span><p>THE APPEARANCE OF THE LUNGS</p></div>
<div class="indent1"><span class="nm">(a)</span><p><span class="cl">(Rafram):</span> If the lungs resemble spliced wood, it is Tereifah.</p></div>
<div class="indent2"><span class="nm">1.</span><p><span class="cl">Version #1:</span> This means that their color is like wood.</p></div>
<div class="indent2"><span class="nm">2.</span><p><span class="cl">Version #2:</span> This means that they feel (hard) like wood.</p></div>
<div class="indent3"><span class="nm">i.</span><p>Some say that they are white like wood when inflated (this is like Version #1)</p></div>
<div class="indent3"><span class="nm">ii.</span><p>Some say that they are hard like wood (this is like Version #2).</p></div>
<div class="indent2"><span class="nm">3.</span><p><span class="cl">Version #3:</span> This means that they are smooth like wood, i.e. the chambers are not delineated.</p></div>
<div class="indent1"><span class="nm">(b)</span><p><span class="cl">(Rava):</span> If the lungs are blue, it is Kosher. If they are black, it is Tereifah.</p></div>
<div class="indent2"><span class="nm">1.</span><p><span class="cl">(R. Chanina):</span> Black was originally red, but it was stricken.</p></div>
<div class="indent1"><span class="nm">(c)</span><p>From R. Noson we learn that Yarok and Adumah (red) are Kosher (for they will become healthy again. Stam Yarok is yellow. Green is normally called 'Yarok like leeks.' Rashi says that Adumah is the  redness due to a ruptured blood vessel.)</p></div>
<div class="indent2"><span class="nm">1.</span><p><span class="cl">(Beraisa - R. Noson):</span> I met a woman who had lost two sons through circumcision. The third baby was Yarok. I counseled her to postpone the Bris until the blood was absorbed. The baby survived the Bris.</p></div>
<div class="indent2"><span class="nm">2.</span><p>I met another woman who had lost two sons through Milah. Her third baby was red. I counseled her to postpone the Milah until he gets enough blood. The baby survived the Milah.</p></div>
<div class="indent1"><span class="nm">(d)</span><p><span class="cl">(Rav Kahana):</span> If the lungs are like (the color of) a liver, it is Kosher; if they are like flesh, it is Tereifah.</p></div>
<div class="indent1"><span class="nm">(e)</span><p><span class="cl">(Rav Sama brei d'Rava):</span> If the lungs are like hops, saffron or an egg, it is Tereifah.</p></div>
<div class="indent1"><span class="nm">(f)</span><p><span class="cl">Question:</span> If so (yellow is Tereifah), in what case is Yarok Kosher?</p></div>
<div class="indent1"><span class="nm">(g)</span><p><span class="cl">Answer:</span> If they are Yarok like leeks (green), it is Kosher.</p></div>
<div class="indent1"><span class="nm">(h)</span><p><span class="cl">(Ravina):</span> If part of the lungs is stopped up, one cuts them:</p></div>
<div class="indent2"><span class="nm">1.</span><p>If pus comes out, surely, this was clogging them, so it is Kosher;</p></div>
<div class="indent2"><span class="nm">2.</span><p>If not, one puts a feather or spit on the clogged area. If it moves when one blows through the lungs, it is Kosher (air could get through). If not, it is Tereifah (the lungs were stricken).</p></div>
<div class="subject"><span class="nm">3)</span><p>HOLES IN THE LUNGS</p></div>
<div class="indent1"><span class="nm">(a)</span><p><span class="cl">(Rav Yosef):</span> A scab over a wound in the lungs is of no significance (since it will break). It is Tereifah.</p></div>
<div class="indent1"><span class="nm">(b)</span><p><span class="cl">(Rav Yosef):</span> If when one blows into the lungs, it sounds like air is escaping, he must check it.</p></div>
<div class="indent2"><span class="nm">1.</span><p>If he knows from where the sound comes, he puts a feather, piece of straw or some spit there. If there really is a hole, it will move when he blows.</p></div>
<div class="indent2"><span class="nm">2.</span><p>If he does not know from where the sound comes, he puts the lungs in a basin of lukewarm water and blows into the lungs.</p></div>
<div class="indent3"><span class="nm">i.</span><p>One may not use hot water. This would constrict the hole.</p></div>
<div class="indent3"><span class="nm">ii.</span><p>One may not use cold water. This could cause the outer membrane to tear.</p></div>
<div class="indent2"><span class="nm">3.</span><p>If he sees bubbles, there is a hole, so it is Tereifah;</p></div>
<div class="indent3"><span class="nm">i.</span><p>If there are no bubbles, the noise was due to a tear in the inner membrane alone. It is Kosher.</p></div>
<div class="indent1"><span class="nm">(c)</span><p><span class="cl">(Ula):</span> If the inside of the lungs pours like water, it is Kosher.</p></div>
<div class="indent2"><span class="nm">1.</span><p>He must hold that an internal Chisaron (deficiency) in the lungs (that allows the contents to flow from one side to the other) does not make it Tereifah.</p></div>
<div class="indent1"><span class="nm">(d)</span><p><span class="cl">Question (R. Aba - Mishnah):</span> If the lungs were punctured or Chaserim (it is Tereifah).</p></div>
<div class="indent2"><span class="nm">1.</span><p><span class="cl">Question:</span> What is the case of Chaserim?</p></div>
<div class="indent3"><span class="nm">i.</span><p><span class="cl">Suggestion:</span> They are Chaserim on the outside.</p></div>
<div class="indent3"><span class="nm">ii.</span><p><span class="cl">Rejection:</span> We already know this case, for it is punctured!</p></div>
<div class="indent2"><span class="nm">2.</span><p><span class="cl">Answer:</span> Rather, there is an internal Chisaron.</p></div>
<div class="indent1"><span class="nm">(e)</span><p><span class="cl">Answer:</span> Really, the Chisaron extends to the outside. R. Shimon taught this clause. He says that a punctured lung is Tereifah only if the hole extends to the main branch.</p></div>
<div class="indent2"><span class="nm">1.</span><p>This is only if flesh of the lung is not missing. If flesh is missing, he agrees that it need not extend to the main branch.</p></div>
<div class="indent1"><span class="nm">(f)</span><p>R. Chananyah ruled that if the inside of the lungs pours like water, it is Kosher.</p></div>
<div class="indent2"><span class="nm">1.</span><p><span class="cl">(Rava):</span> This is only if the branches are intact.</p></div>
<div class="indent2"><span class="nm">2.</span><p><span class="cl">Question: (Rav Acha brei d'Rava):</span> How can one know that all the branches are intact?</p></div>
<div class="indent2"><span class="nm">3.</span><p><span class="cl">Answer (Rav Ashi):</span> One pours out the insides onto a lead-glazed bowl. If one sees white dots, branches were dissolved; if not, all are intact.</p></div>
<div class="indent1"><span class="nm">(g)</span><p><span class="cl">(Rav Nachman):</span> If some of the interior of the lungs is missing but the membrane is intact, it is Kosher.</p></div>
<div class="indent1"><span class="nm">(h)</span><p><span class="cl">Support (Beraisa):</span> If some of the interior of the lungs is missing but the membrane is intact, even if a Revi'is is missing, it is Kosher;</p></div>
<div class="indent2"><span class="nm">1.</span><p>If the womb was removed, it is Kosher;</p></div>
<div class="indent2"><span class="nm">2.</span><p>The Sanhedrin in Yavneh ruled that if the liver is wormy, it is Kosher.</p></div>
