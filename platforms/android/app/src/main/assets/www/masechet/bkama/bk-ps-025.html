<p class="dedicationbox"><br>PAST DEDICATION<br>BAVA KAMA 21-25 - Two weeks of study material have been dedicated by Mrs. Estanne Abraham Fawer to honor the ninth Yahrzeit of her father, Rav Mordechai ben Eliezer Zvi (Rabbi Morton Weiner) Z'L, who passed away on 18 Teves 5760. May the merit of supporting and advancing Dafyomi study -- which was so important to him -- during the weeks of his Yahrzeit serve as an Iluy for his Neshamah. </p>

<p class="bas subject"><span class="nm">1)</span>DAYO</p>
<p class="bas indent1"><span class="nm">(a)</span><span class="cl">Question:</span> Does R. Tarfon not apply Dayo? Dayo is mid'Oraisa!</p>
<p class="bas indent2"><span class="nm">1.</span><span class="cl">(Beraisa):</span> "If (Miryam's) father would spit at her, she should be shut up for seven days" - all the more so, she should be shut up for 14 days when the Divine Presence is angry at her!</p>
<p class="bas indent2"><span class="nm">2.</span>However, due to Dayo, she will be shut up for seven days.</p>
<p class="bas indent1"><span class="nm">(b)</span><span class="cl">Answer:</span> He agrees to Dayo when it still allows something to be learned from the Kal va'Chomer;</p>
<p class="bas indent2"><span class="nm">1.</span>No verse teaches that she should be shut up seven days due to the Divine Presence. A Kal va'Chomer teaches 14, and Dayo says that we may only learn seven.</p>
<p class="bas indent2"><span class="nm">2.</span>Regarding Keren, the verse that teaches half- damage also applies to the victim's premises. If we apply Dayo, the Kal va'Chomer will not teach anything!</p>
<p class="bas indent2"><span class="nm">3.</span>Chachamim say, "She will be shut up seven days" already teaches seven days due to the Divine Presence (and even so, we say Dayo)!</p>
<p class="bas indent2"><span class="nm">4.</span>R. Tarfon says, that verse teaches Dayo. Without it, we would have said that she will be shut up 14 days!</p>
<p class="bas indent2"><span class="nm">5.</span><span class="cl">Chachamim:</span> Another verse teaches that - "Miryam was shut up (...seven days)"!</p>
<p class="bas indent2"><span class="nm">6.</span>R. Tarfon says, that teaches that we generally say Dayo (if there is no other Chidush of the Kal va'Chomer). One might have thought that Dayo applied only to Miryam, due to Moshe's honor.</p>
<p class="bas subject"><span class="nm">2)</span><i>TANA'IM</i> WHO ARGUE ABOUT <i>DAYO</i></p>
<p class="bas indent1"><span class="nm">(a)</span><span class="cl">Question (Rav Papa):</span> The following Tana who does not apply Dayo even when it would not cause that nothing is learned from the Kal va'Chomer!</p>
<p class="bas indent2"><span class="nm">1.</span><span class="cl">(Beraisa):</span> What is the source that semen of a Zav is Tamei? We learn from a Kal va'Chomer.</p>
<p class="bas indent3"><span class="nm">i.</span>Tahor emissions of a Tahor person (e.g. his spit), such emissions of a Tamei person (e.g. a Zav) are Tamei. Emissions of a Tahor person that are Tamei (e.g. his semen), all the more so from a Tamei person they are Tamei!</p>
<p class="bas indent2"><span class="nm">2.</span><span class="cl">Summation of question:</span> He learns (that a Zav's semen has all the Tum'ah of his spit, i.e.) Maga (through touching) and Masa (through moving). He should learn only Tum'as Maga. Dayo should prevent him from learning Tum'as Masa!</p>
<p class="bas indent2"><span class="nm">3.</span><span class="cl">Suggestion:</span> We do not need a Kal va'Chomer for Maga. The verse that teaches Tum'ah (of Maga) of semen applies also to a Zav!</p>
<p class="bas indent2"><span class="nm">4.</span><span class="cl">Rejection:</span> That verse says "a chance happening of the night." One might have thought that this does not apply to a Zav, for his semen has a cause (his malady)! We need the Kal va'Chomer to teach that this is not so.</p>
<p class="bas indent1"><span class="nm">(b)</span><span class="cl">Answer (Abaye):</span> The verse does not say that the semen has no cause (we do not need the Kal va'Chomer for Tum'as Maga).</p>
<p class="bas indent1"><span class="nm">(c)</span><span class="cl">Question:</span> Which Tana holds that semen of a Zav has Tum'as Masa? This is unlike R. Eliezer and unlike R. Yehoshua!</p>
<p class="bas indent2"><span class="nm">1.</span><span class="cl">(Beraisa - R. Eliezer):</span> The semen of a Zav has Tum'as Maga, but not Masa;</p>
<p class="bas indent2"><span class="nm">2.</span>R. Yehoshua says, it has even Masa, for it surely has drops of Zivah.</p>
<p class="bas indent3"><span class="nm">i.</span>R. Yehoshua says that it has Tum'as Masa only because it has drops of Zivah, but semen itself lacks Tum'as Masa!</p>
<p class="bas indent1"><span class="nm">(d)</span><span class="cl">Answer:</span> It is the following Tana:</p>
<p class="bas indent2"><span class="nm">1.</span><span class="cl">(Mishnah):</span> Stricter Tum'os, i.e. the Zivah, spit, semen and urine of a Zav, and the blood of a Nidah, Tum'as Maga and Masa.</p>
<p class="bas bbbline">25b----------------------------------------25b</p>
<p class="bas indent1"><span class="nm">(e)</span><span class="cl">Question:</span> Perhaps the Tana only says so because semen has drops of Zivah in it!</p>
<p class="bas indent1"><span class="nm">(f)</span><span class="cl">Answer:</span> If so, he would have taught semen next to Zivah. Rather, it was taught next to spit, for he learned it from a Kal va'Chomer from a Zav's spit.</p>
<p class="bas subject"><span class="nm">3)</span>THE <i>TUM'AH</i> OF A MAT</p>
<p class="bas indent1"><span class="nm">(a)</span><span class="cl">Question (R. Acha mi'Difti):</span> The Tana of the following Beraisa does not apply Dayo even when it would not cause that nothing is learned from the Kal va'Chomer!</p>
<p class="bas indent2"><span class="nm">1.</span><span class="cl">(Beraisa):</span> A Kal va'Chomer teaches that a mat can receive Tum'as Mes (i.e. of a corpse). Small flasks do not receive Tum'ah from a Zav (the opening is too small to stick his finger inside), but they receive Tum'as Mes;</p>
<p class="bas indent3"><span class="nm">i.</span>A mat receives Tum'ah from a Zav, all the more so it receives Tum'as Mes!</p>
<p class="bas indent2"><span class="nm">2.</span><span class="cl">Summation of question:</span> The Tana learns both Tum'as Erev (for which it suffices to immerse it in a Mikvah, and it is fully Tahor at nightfall), and seven-day Tum'ah (which requires sprinkling with water with ashes of the red heifer)!</p>
<p class="bas indent3"><span class="nm">i.</span>He should say learn Tum'as Erev from the Kal va'Chomer, and Dayo should prevent learning seven-day Tum'ah!</p>
<p class="bas indent1"><span class="nm">(b)</span><span class="cl">Answer (Abaye):</span> Really, the Tana learns that a mat receives Tum'as Erev from Sheratzim (rodents) from the Kal va'Chomer:</p>
<p class="bas indent2"><span class="nm">1.</span>Small flasks do not receive Tum'ah from a Zav, but they receive Tum'as Sheratzim (since very small rodents can enter them);</p>
<p class="bas indent3"><span class="nm">i.</span>A mat receives Tum'ah from a Zav, all the more so it receives Tum'as Sheratzim!</p>
<p class="bas indent1"><span class="nm">(c)</span><span class="cl">Question:</span> From where does he learn Tum'as Mes of a mat?</p>
<p class="bas indent1"><span class="nm">(d)</span><span class="cl">Answer:</span> It says "a garment or leather" regarding Tum'as Sheratzim and also regarding Tum'as Mes. Just like a mat receives Tum'as Sheratzim, it receives Tum'as Mes.</p>
<p class="bas indent1"><span class="nm">(e)</span><span class="cl">Assertion:</span> We must say that the words "a garment or leather" are extra only to teach the Gezeirah Shavah. If not, we could refute the teaching!</p>
<p class="bas indent2"><span class="nm">1.</span>A lentil's volume of a Sheretz is Metamei, but an olive's volume of a Mes is needed to be Metamei (this shows that Tum'as Sheratzim is broader. Perhaps mats only receive Tum'as Sheratzim, but Tum'as Mes.)</p>
<p class="bas indent1"><span class="nm">(f)</span><span class="cl">Confirmation:</span> Indeed, the words are extra.</p>
<p class="bas indent2"><span class="nm">1.</span>Sheratzim are equated to semen "a man who will have a seminal emission... a man who will touch a Sheretz."</p>
<p class="bas indent1"><span class="nm">(g)</span><span class="cl">Question:</span> It says about semen "any garment and any leather that semen it will be on (will be Tamei)." Why did the Torah write "a garment or leather" regarding Sheratzim? (We could have learned from semen!)</p>
<p class="bas indent1"><span class="nm">(h)</span><span class="cl">Answer:</span> The words "a garment or leather" written regarding Sheratzim are free for the Gezeirah Shavah.</p>
<p class="bas indent1"><span class="nm">(i)</span><span class="cl">Question:</span> We showed that "a garment or leather" written regarding Sheratzim is extra. This suffices for the opinion that does not challenge a Gezeirah Shavah if (the word(s) of) one side is extra;</p>
<p class="bas indent2"><span class="nm">1.</span>According to the opinion that challenges it unless both sides are extra, how can we answer?</p>
<p class="bas indent1"><span class="nm">(j)</span><span class="cl">Answer:</span> The words "a garment or leather" written regarding Tum'as Mes are also free.</p>
<p class="bas indent2"><span class="nm">1.</span>Tum'as Mes is equated to semen - "anyone who will touch someone who is Tamei Mes, or a man who will have a seminal emission";</p>
<p class="bas indent1"><span class="nm">(k)</span><span class="cl">Question:</span> It says about semen "any garment and any leather that semen will be on it (will be Tamei)." Why did the Torah write "a garment or leather" regarding Tum'as Mes?</p>
<p class="bas indent1"><span class="nm">(l)</span><span class="cl">Answer:</span> The words are free for the Gezeirah Shavah.</p>
<p class="bas indent1"><span class="nm">(m)</span><span class="cl">Question:</span> This is like the opinion that when we learn a law from another topic, the law is governed by rules of its own realm. (I.e. when we learn from semen (Rashi, according to Maharsha; Maharshal - from Sheratzim) that Tum'as Mes applies to a mat, we say that it is like all things that receive Tum'as Mes, it can receive seven-day Tum'ah);</p>
<p class="bas indent2"><span class="nm">1.</span>According to the opinion that when we learn a law from another topic, we totally learn from that topic (i.e. when we learn from semen or Sheratzim that Tum'as Mes applies to a mat, we learn only Tum'as Erev, which applies to Sheratzim), how do we learn seven-day Tum'ah?</p>
<p class="bas indent1"><span class="nm">(n)</span><span class="cl">Answer (Rava):</span> "You will wash your clothing on the seventh day" - no Tum'ah of Mes is less than seven days.</p>
<p class="bas subject"><span class="nm">4)</span><i>SHEN</i> AND <i>REGEL</i> ARE EXEMPT IN A <i>RESHUS</i> <i>HA'RABIM</i></p>
<p class="bas indent1"><span class="nm">(a)</span><span class="cl">Suggestion:</span> A Kal va'Chomer should obligate Shen and Regel in a Reshus ha'Rabim!</p>
<p class="bas indent2"><span class="nm">1.</span>Keren only pays half-damage in the victim's premises, and it is liable in a Reshus ha'Rabim. Shen and Regel pay full damage in the victim's premises. All the more so they should be liable in a Reshus ha'Rabim!</p>
<p class="bas indent1"><span class="nm">(b)</span><span class="cl">Rejection:</span> "It will consume in another's field" - not in a Reshus ha'Rabim.</p>
