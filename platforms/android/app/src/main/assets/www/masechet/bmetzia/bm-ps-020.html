<p class="bas subject"><span class="nm">1)</span>ONE WHO FINDS A RECEIPT (cont.)</p>
<p class="bas indent1"><span class="nm">(a)</span><span class="cl">Answer #1 (Rava):</span> This shows that Shmuel is correct:</p>
<p class="bas indent2"><span class="nm">1.</span><span class="cl">(Shmuel):</span> If Reuven sold a loan document to Shimon, and then pardoned the debt, the debt is cancelled. If Reuven died without pardoning it, even Reuven's heir can pardon the debt. (Since Leah can pardon the Kesuvah anyway, returning the document does not hurt the buyer.)</p>
<p class="bas indent1"><span class="nm">(b)</span><span class="cl">Rejection (and Answer #2 - Abaye):</span> This is not a proof for Shmuel. The case is, she is holding her Kesuvah (so there is no concern lest she sold it).</p>
<p class="bas indent1"><span class="nm">(c)</span>Rava says that this does not eliminate the concern. Perhaps two Kesuvos were written!</p>
<p class="bas indent1"><span class="nm">(d)</span>Abaye is not concerned for two Kesuvos;</p>
<p class="bas indent2"><span class="nm">1.</span>Further, even if we were concerned, a receipt pardons the debt on the day it is signed (even if it was given only later);</p>
<p class="bas indent2"><span class="nm">2.</span>This is like Abaye taught elsewhere, that when witnesses sign a document, they immediately acquire on behalf of the receiver.</p>
<p class="bas subject"><span class="nm">2)</span>DOCUMENTS THAT WE RETURN</p>
<p class="bas indent1"><span class="nm">(a)</span><span class="cl">(Mishnah):</span> If one found documents of appraisal (of a borrower's land), of food (from a man who accepted to feed a stepdaughter), documents of Chalitzah or Mi'un, documents of Birurin (clarification or choosing; this will be explained), and all actions of Beis Din, he returns them.</p>
<p class="bas indent1"><span class="nm">(b)</span>If he found a document in a Chafisah or Deluskema (pouch or box), or documents wrapped together in a Tachrich or Agudah, he returns it.</p>
<p class="bas indent2"><span class="nm">1.</span>Three documents tied together is considered an Agudah.</p>
<p class="bas indent1"><span class="nm">(c)</span>R. Shimon ben Gamliel says, if Reuven borrowed from three people, we return them to Reuven. If three people borrowed from Shimon, we return them to Shimon.</p>
<p class="bas indent1"><span class="nm">(d)</span>If one finds a document among his documents and does not know who deposited it with him (the lender or borrower), he leaves it until Eliyahu comes;</p>
<p class="bas indent2"><span class="nm">1.</span>If (the lender) finds a receipt (among his own documents), he acts according to it.</p>
<p class="bas indent1"><span class="nm">(e)</span><span class="cl">(Gemara) Question:</span> What are documents of Birurin?</p>
<p class="bas indent1"><span class="nm">(f)</span><span class="cl">Answer #1 (Chachamim of Bavel):</span> They are documents that give the parties' claims.</p>
<p class="bas indent1"><span class="nm">(g)</span><span class="cl">Answer #2 (R. Yirmiyah):</span> Each party selected one judge (and the two judges will pick the third).</p>
<p class="bas indent1"><span class="nm">(h)</span><span class="cl">(Mishnah):</span> We return any document of actions of Beis Din.</p>
<p class="bas indent1"><span class="nm">(i)</span>A Get was found in Rav Huna's Beis Din; it said 'in the city of Sheviri, on the Rachis River.'</p>
<p class="bas indent1"><span class="nm">(j)</span><span class="cl">Question (Rav Huna):</span> Are we concerned lest there are two cities 'Sheviri' on the Rachis River (and this Get belongs to a man of the other city)?</p>
<p class="bas bbbline">20b----------------------------------------20b</p>
<p class="bas indent1"><span class="nm">(k)</span><span class="cl">Answer (Rabah - Mishnah):</span> We return any document of actions of Beis Din.</p>
<p class="bas indent1"><span class="nm">(l)</span><span class="cl">Question (Rav Amram):</span> How can you learn about a Get, which affects an Isur, from monetary laws?</p>
<p class="bas indent1"><span class="nm">(m)</span><span class="cl">Answer (Rabah):</span> Actions of Beis Din include document of Chalitzah and Mi'un, which are Isurim.</p>
<p class="bas subject"><span class="nm">3)</span>DOCUMENTS FOUND TOGETHER</p>
<p class="bas indent1"><span class="nm">(a)</span><span class="cl">(Mishnah):</span> If they were found in a Chafisah or Deluskema.</p>
<p class="bas indent1"><span class="nm">(b)</span><span class="cl">Question:</span> What is a Chafisah?</p>
<p class="bas indent1"><span class="nm">(c)</span><span class="cl">Answer (Rabah bar bar Chanah):</span> It is a small wine pouch.</p>
<p class="bas indent1"><span class="nm">(d)</span><span class="cl">Question:</span> What is a Deluskema?</p>
<p class="bas indent1"><span class="nm">(e)</span><span class="cl">Answer (Rabah bar Shmuel):</span> It is a box in which old people put their Kelim.</p>
<p class="bas indent1"><span class="nm">(f)</span><span class="cl">(Mishnah):</span> A Tachrich or Agudah of documents.</p>
<p class="bas indent1"><span class="nm">(g)</span><span class="cl">Question:</span> How many is considered a Tachrich?</p>
<p class="bas indent1"><span class="nm">(h)</span><span class="cl">Answer:</span> It is three wrapped together.</p>
<p class="bas indent1"><span class="nm">(i)</span><span class="cl">Question:</span> How many is considered an Agudah?</p>
<p class="bas indent1"><span class="nm">(j)</span><span class="cl">Answer #1:</span> It is three tied together.</p>
<p class="bas indent1"><span class="nm">(k)</span><span class="cl">Inference:</span> This teaches that the type of knot is a Siman.</p>
<p class="bas indent1"><span class="nm">(l)</span><span class="cl">Rejection (and Answer #2):</span> R. Chiya taught that an Agudah is three wrapped together (and the fact that they were wrapped is the Siman).</p>
<p class="bas indent1"><span class="nm">(m)</span><span class="cl">Question:</span> That is a Tachrich!</p>
<p class="bas indent1"><span class="nm">(n)</span><span class="cl">Answer:</span> In a Tachrich, the first document is rolled, and each successive document is wrapped around the previous ones, so the top of each is near the bottom of the previous. In an Agudah, the parchments were placed resting on each other, and all were wrapped at once.</p>
<p class="bas indent1"><span class="nm">(o)</span><span class="cl">Question:</span> If one finds them, what does he announce (so the loser will know to claim them)?</p>
<p class="bas indent1"><span class="nm">(p)</span><span class="cl">Answer #1:</span> He announces how many he found.</p>
<p class="bas indent1"><span class="nm">(q)</span><span class="cl">Objection:</span> If the loser need not say how many there were (just that they were wrapped together) he should announce even if there were only two!</p>
<p class="bas indent1"><span class="nm">(r)</span><span class="cl">Answer #2:</span> Ravina taught that one who finds coins announces 'coins'. Here, he announces 'documents.'</p>
<p class="bas indent1"><span class="nm">(s)</span><span class="cl">(Mishnah - R. Shimon ben Gamliel):</span> If Reuven borrowed from three people, we return them to him.</p>
<p class="bas indent2"><span class="nm">1.</span>Had they fallen from the lenders, there is no reason why they would be wrapped together.</p>
<p class="bas indent2"><span class="nm">2.</span><span class="cl">Question:</span> Perhaps they were being brought to be validated!</p>
<p class="bas indent2"><span class="nm">3.</span><span class="cl">Answer:</span> The case is, they are already validated.</p>
<p class="bas indent2"><span class="nm">4.</span><span class="cl">Question:</span> Perhaps the scribe dropped them!</p>
<p class="bas indent2"><span class="nm">5.</span><span class="cl">Answer:</span> A lender would not leave a validated document with the scribe.</p>
<p class="bas indent1"><span class="nm">(t)</span><span class="cl">(Mishnah):</span> If Shimon lent to three people, we return them to him.</p>
<p class="bas indent2"><span class="nm">1.</span>Had they fallen from the borrowers, there is no reason why they would be wrapped together.</p>
<p class="bas indent2"><span class="nm">2.</span><span class="cl">Question:</span> Perhaps one scribe wrote all of them!</p>
<p class="bas indent2"><span class="nm">3.</span><span class="cl">Answer:</span> The case is, the handwriting reveals that different scribes wrote them.</p>
<p class="bas indent2"><span class="nm">4.</span><span class="cl">Question:</span> Perhaps they were being brought to be validated!</p>
<p class="bas indent2"><span class="nm">5.</span><span class="cl">Answer:</span> The lender validates documents. The borrower does not.</p>
<p class="bas subject"><span class="nm">4)</span>DO WE ACT ACCORDING TO A RECEIPT?</p>
<p class="bas indent1"><span class="nm">(a)</span><span class="cl">(Mishnah):</span> If there is a receipt with them, he acts according to it.</p>
<p class="bas indent1"><span class="nm">(b)</span><span class="cl">(R. Yirmiyah bar Aba):</span> If the lender has a receipt, even in his own handwriting, we ignore it.</p>
<p class="bas indent2"><span class="nm">1.</span>This is not only if a scribe wrote it, for then we can say that he happened to find a scribe, and had him write it (in case he will not find a scribe when he needs it);</p>
<p class="bas indent2"><span class="nm">2.</span>Even if he wrote it himself, he wanted to be ready, in case the borrower will want to pay just before Shabbos on condition that he receives a receipt, and there will not be time to write one. (The coming five questions are against R. Yirmiyah.)</p>
<p class="bas indent1"><span class="nm">(c)</span><span class="cl">Question #1 (Mishnah):</span> If (the lender) finds a receipt (among his own documents), he does like it says.</p>
<p class="bas indent1"><span class="nm">(d)</span><span class="cl">Answer:</span> We can answer like Rav Safra answered (below). The case is, he found it (the document for which this receipt was written) among torn documents (this confirms that the document was paid. Alternatively, the <i>receipt</i> was among torn documents, to show that <i>he</i> does not need the receipt, i.e. he was already paid.)</p>
<p class="bas indent1"><span class="nm">(e)</span><span class="cl">Question #2 (Mishnah):</span> If Reuven lent to two people with the same name, and found a receipt saying that one of them was paid, he may not collect from either.</p>
<p class="bas indent1"><span class="nm">(f)</span><span class="cl">Answer:</span> Here also, we can answer like Rav Safra. He found it among torn documents.</p>
<p class="bas indent1"><span class="nm">(g)</span><span class="cl">Question #3 (Mishnah):</span> (If Reuven's orphans that want to collect what Shimon owed Reuven from Shimon's orphans,) they must swear 'our father did not tell us, nor did we find a receipt among his documents saying that this debt was paid.' (This implies that such a receipt would be valid!)</p>
<p class="bas indent1"><span class="nm">(h)</span><span class="cl">Answer (Rav Safra):</span> If they would find it among torn documents, the receipt would be valid.</p>
