<div class="indent1"><span class="nm">(a)</span><p><span class="cl">(Mishnah):</span> Some Menachos require oil and Levonah. Some require oil but not Levonah. Some require Levonah but not oil. Some do not require oil or Levonah.</p></div>
<div class="indent1"><span class="nm">(b)</span><p>The following require oil and Levonah;</p></div>
<div class="indent2"><span class="nm">1.</span><p>Minchas Soles, Machavas, Marcheshes, (Ma'afe Tanur) Chalos and Rekikim, Minchas Kohanim, Chavitim, the Minchah of Nochrim or women, and the Omer;</p></div>
<div class="indent1"><span class="nm">(c)</span><p>Minchas Nesachim requires oil but not Levonah;</p></div>
<div class="indent1"><span class="nm">(d)</span><p>Lechem ha'Panim requires Levonah but not oil;</p></div>
<div class="indent1"><span class="nm">(e)</span><p>Shtei ha'Lechem, Minchas Chotei and Minchas Kena'os do not require oil or Levonah.</p></div>
<div class="indent1"><span class="nm">(f)</span><p><span class="cl">Version #1 (Gemara - Rav Papa):</span> Whenever the Mishnah lists the Minchos Nedavah (i.e. here, 60a, and 72b), each of them is baked into 10 loaves;</p></div>
<div class="indent2"><span class="nm">1.</span><p>Rav Papa holds that the Halachah is not like R. Shimon, who says that Ma'afe Tanur may be brought half Chalos and half Rekikim.</p></div>
<div class="indent1"><span class="nm">(g)</span><p><span class="cl">Version #2 (Rav Papa):</span> Whenever the Mishnah lists the different Menachos, it lists 10 kinds;</p></div>
<div class="indent2"><span class="nm">1.</span><p>The Stam Mishnah argues with R. Shimon, who says that Ma'afe Tanur may be brought half Chalos and half Rekikim. (He holds that there is an 11th kind, half-half.)</p></div>

<div class="indent1"><span class="nm">(a)</span><p><span class="cl">(Beraisa):</span> "V'Nasata Aleha (on Minchas ha'Omer) Shemen", but not on Lechem ha'Panim. The verse overrides a Kal va'Chomer:</p></div>
<div class="indent2"><span class="nm">1.</span><p>Minchas Nesachim does not require Levonah, yet it requires oil. Lechem ha'Panim requires Levonah, all the more so it should require oil!</p></div>
<div class="indent2"><span class="nm">2.</span><p>Therefore it says "Aleha Shemen" - but not on Lechem ha'Panim.</p></div>
<div class="indent1"><span class="nm">(b)</span><p>"V'Samta Aleha Levonah (on the Omer)", but not on Minchas Nesachim. The verse overrides a Kal va'Chomer:</p></div>

<div class="indent1"><span class="nm">(e)</span><p><span class="cl">Question:</span> The Beraisa expounded "Aleha" to exclude Lechem ha'Panim (from oil). Perhaps we should exclude Minchas Kohanim instead!</p></div>
<div class="indent1"><span class="nm">(f)</span><p><span class="cl">Answer:</span> It is more reasonable that Minchas Kohanim has oil, like the Omer, for they share the following properties:</p></div>

<div class="indent1"><span class="nm">(a)</span><p><span class="cl">(Mishnah):</span> If one puts oil and Levonah on Minchas Chotei, he is liable for each of them by itself;</p></div>
<div class="indent1"><span class="nm">(b)</span><p>If one put oil (on Minchas Chotei), it is Pasul. If he put Levonah, he must remove it.</p></div>
<div class="indent1"><span class="nm">(c)</span><p>If one put oil on the Shirayim he does not transgress a Lav. If he put a Kli with oil on the Kli holding the Minchah, the Minchah is Kosher.</p></div>
<div class="indent1"><span class="nm">(d)</span><p><span class="cl">(Gemara - Beraisa):</span> "Lo Yasim Aleha Shemen" - if he put oil on it, it is Pasul;</p></div>
<div class="indent2"><span class="nm">1.</span><p><span class="cl">Suggestion:</span> Perhaps "v'Lo Yiten Aleha Levonah" disqualified if he put Levonah on it!</p></div>
<div class="indent2"><span class="nm">2.</span><p><span class="cl">Rejection:</span> It says "Ki Chatas." (It is still Mechaper like a Chatas, even if Levonah was put on it.)</p></div>

<div class="indent2"><span class="nm">4.</span><p><span class="cl">Rejection:</span> It says "Hi". (It is Mechaper only if done properly.)</p></div>
<div class="indent2"><span class="nm">5.</span><p><span class="cl">Question:</span> (The words that are Machshir and disqualify do not specify which is Kosher and which is Pasul.) Why do we say that oil disqualifies but Levonah does not, and not vice-versa?</p></div>
<div class="indent2"><span class="nm">6.</span><p><span class="cl">Answer:</span> Oil disqualifies because it cannot be removed. Levonah does not disqualify because it can be removed.</p></div>
<div class="indent1"><span class="nm">(e)</span><p><span class="cl">Question (Rabah bar Rav Huna):</span> If ground up Levonah was put on it, what is the law?</p></div>
<div class="indent2"><span class="nm">1.</span><p>If (normally) Levonah is not Posel because it can be removed, here it cannot be removed!</p></div>

<div class="indent1"><span class="nm">(f)</span><p><span class="cl">Answer #1 (R. Yochanan - Mishnah):</span> If he put Levonah, he must remove it. (This implies that if he does not, it is Pasul.)</p></div>
<div class="indent1"><span class="nm">(g)</span><p><span class="cl">Rejection:</span> Perhaps the Mishnah teaches two reasons why it is Kosher:</p></div>
<div class="indent2"><span class="nm">1.</span><p>Firstly, it is not absorbed. Secondly, he will remove it.</p></div>
<div class="indent1"><span class="nm">(h)</span><p><span class="cl">Answer #2 (Beraisa):</span> Levonah is not Posel because it can be removed.</p></div>
<div class="indent1"><span class="nm">(i)</span><p><span class="cl">Rejection:</span> Here also, the Beraisa gives two reasons to be Machshir! It is not absorbed; and it can be removed.</p></div>
<div class="indent1"><span class="nm">(j)</span><p><span class="cl">Question:</span> What was the conclusion?</p></div>
<div class="indent1"><span class="nm">(k)</span><p><span class="cl">Answer (Rav Nachman bar Yitzchak - Beraisa):</span> If Levonah was put on Minchas Chotei or Minchas Kena'os, it must be removed. The Minchah is Kosher;</p></div>
<div class="indent2"><span class="nm">1.</span><p>If the Kohen had intent Chutz li'Zmano or Chutz li'Mkomo before it was removed, it is Pasul, and there is no Kares;</p></div>
<div class="indent2"><span class="nm">2.</span><p>If he had intent after it was removed, Chutz li'Zmano makes Pigul, and there is Kares. Chutz li'Mkomo is Posel, but there is no Kares. (This shows that the Minchah is Pasul until the Levonah is removed!)</p></div>
<div class="indent1"><span class="nm">(l)</span><p><span class="cl">Version #1 (our text, Rashi) Question:</span> The Levonah is like a flask of oil. While it is on the Minchah, the Minchah is Pasul. Intent should not take effect!</p></div>
<div class="indent1"><span class="nm">(m)</span><p><span class="cl">Answer #1 (Abaye):</span> It is called Chatas (even when Levonah is on it. Therefore intent takes effect).</p></div>
<div class="indent1"><span class="nm">(n)</span><p><span class="cl">Version #2 (Tosfos) Question:</span> The Minchah is Pasul while the Levonah is on it. It should be Nidcheh! (Removing the Levonah should not make it Kosher.)</p></div>
<div class="indent1"><span class="nm">(o)</span><p><span class="cl">Answer #1 (Abaye):</span> It is called Chatas (even when Levonah is on it. Therefore, it can become Kosher again.) (end of Version #2. Answers 2 and 3 apply to both versions.)</p></div>
<div class="indent1"><span class="nm">(p)</span><p><span class="cl">Answer #2 (Rava):</span> Our Mishnah is like Chanan ha'Mitzri, who holds that Ein Dichuy. (Rashi - it is as if the Minchah is Kosher even before the Levonah is removed);</p></div>
<div class="indent2"><span class="nm">1.</span><p><span class="cl">(Beraisa - Chanan ha'Mitzri):</span> If the goat sent to Azazel (on Yom Kipur) died after slaughtering the goat selected for Hash-m, we find another goat to send to Azazel.</p></div>
<div class="indent1"><span class="nm">(q)</span><p><span class="cl">Answer #3 (Rav Ashi):</span> Our Mishnah is even like Chachamim. Anything that one can fix is not considered Dichuy.</p></div>
<div class="indent1"><span class="nm">(r)</span><p><span class="cl">Support (for Rav Ashi - Rav Ada):</span> R. Yehudah holds (in the following Mishnah) that Dichuy takes effect, but when one can fix it (in the following Beraisa), he holds that Ein Dichuy!</p></div>
<div class="indent2"><span class="nm">1.</span><p><span class="cl">(Mishnah - R. Yehudah):</span> If the goat selected for Hash-m was slaughtered and the blood spilled, the goat selected for Azazel must die (and two new goats are taken). If the goat selected for Azazel died, we spill the blood of the slaughtered goat.</p></div>
<div class="indent2"><span class="nm">2.</span><p><span class="cl">(Beraisa - R. Yehudah):</span> (After the Korbanos Pesach were offered,) they would gather a bucketful of blood from the floor from all the Korbanos and throw it on the Mizbe'ach, to be Machshir a Korban (in case its blood spilled. Even though Zerikah must be from a Kli, it was not Nifsal when it spilled.)</p></div>

<div class="indent1"><span class="nm">(a)</span><p><span class="cl">Version #1 (R. Yitzchak bar Yosef):</span> If any amount of oil was put on a k'Zayis of Minchah, it is Pasul.</p></div>
<div class="indent1"><span class="nm">(b)</span><p><span class="cl">Question:</span> What is the reason?</p></div>
<div class="indent1"><span class="nm">(c)</span><p><span class="cl">Answer:</span> "Lo Yasim" refers to putting any amount. "Aleha" connotes (putting on a Minchah that has) a proper Shi'ur;</p></div>
<div class="indent1"><span class="nm">(d)</span><p><span class="cl">(R. Yitzchak bar Yosef):</span> If a k'Zayis of Levonah was put on any amount of Minchah, it is Pasul.</p></div>
<div class="indent1"><span class="nm">(e)</span><p><span class="cl">Question:</span> What is the reason?</p></div>
<div class="indent1"><span class="nm">(f)</span><p><span class="cl">Answer (R. Yochanan):</span> "V'Lo Yiten connotes putting a proper Shi'ur. "Aleha" connotes on a proper Shi'ur. (It says "Aleha" regarding oil, and also regarding Levonah.) Whenever two sources include the same thing, they actually come to exclude. In this case, one who puts Levonah on any amount of Minchah transgresses.</p></div>
