<p class="bas indent1"><span class="nm">(a)</span><span class="cl">Question (Rava):</span> When Beis Din appoints another Shali'ach, must this be in front of the previous Shali'ach?</p>
<p class="bas indent1"><span class="nm">(b)</span><span class="cl">Answer (Rava):</span> They need not appoint in front of the previous Shali'ach.</p>
<p class="bas indent2"><span class="nm">1.</span>Chachamim of Eretz Yisrael ruled like Rava.</p>
<p class="bas subject"><span class="nm">2)</span>DOES ONES INVALIDATE A <i>GET</i>?</p>
<p class="bas indent1"><span class="nm">(a)</span>A case occurred in which Reuven told his wife 'this Get should take effect if I do not return in 30 days.' He was returning; the ferry to cross the river was not available. He shouted 'see, I am returning!'</p>
<p class="bas indent1"><span class="nm">(b)</span><span class="cl">Shmuel:</span> This is not considered returning. The Get takes effect.</p>
<p class="bas indent1"><span class="nm">(c)</span>A case occurred in which Reuven told his wife 'this Get should take effect if I do not appease you within 30 days.' He tried appeasing her; she was not appeased.</p>
<p class="bas indent1"><span class="nm">(d)</span><span class="cl">Version #1 (Rav Yosef):</span> He did not give to her a chest full of coins (i.e. he did not try hard enough to appease her. The Get takes effect.)</p>
<p class="bas indent1"><span class="nm">(e)</span><span class="cl">Version #2 (Rav Yosef):</span> Must he give to her a chest full of coins?! He stipulated only to make a reasonable attempt to appease her. He did this. She is the one who refuses to be appeased!</p>
<p class="bas indent2"><span class="nm">1.</span>Version #2 is like the opinion that Yesh Ones b'Gitin. (If one gave a Get on condition, and was unable to fulfill it due to an unexpected reason beyond his control, it is as if he fulfilled it, and the Get is void.) Version #1 is like the opinion that Ein Ones b'Gitin.</p>
<p class="bas subject"><span class="nm">3)</span>A DEBT TO BE PAID THROUGH TITHES</p>
<p class="bas indent1"><span class="nm">(a)</span><span class="cl">(Mishnah):</span> Reuven lent money to Shimon, who is a Kohen, Levi or Oni (poor person). He stipulated that he will keep the Terumah or Ma'aser or Ma'aser Oni that he would have given to Shimon, and deduct its value from the loan. He may do this, and assume that Shimon is still alive.</p>
<p class="bas indent2"><span class="nm">1.</span>He need not be concerned that Shimon died, or (if he was poor) that he became rich.</p>
<p class="bas indent2"><span class="nm">2.</span>If he hears that Shimon died, he must ask Shimon's heirs for permission to continue the deal.</p>
<p class="bas indent2"><span class="nm">3.</span>If the loan was made in front of Beis Din, he need not ask the heirs for permission.</p>
<p class="bas indent1"><span class="nm">(b)</span><span class="cl">Question:</span> Is this even if Shimon never received the tithes? (Reuven is obligated to give them!)</p>
<p class="bas indent1"><span class="nm">(c)</span><span class="cl">Answer #1 (Rav):</span> The case is, Reuven always gives his Terumah or Ma'aser to Shimon. Once Reuven separates it, it automatically belongs to Shimon!</p>
<p class="bas indent1"><span class="nm">(d)</span><span class="cl">Answer #2 (Shmuel):</span> The case is, Reuven asks Yehudah to acquire the tithes on behalf of Shimon.</p>
<p class="bas indent1"><span class="nm">(e)</span><span class="cl">Answer #3 (Ula):</span> The Mishnah is like R. Yosi, who says that Chachamim enacted that it is as if one acquired, even though (mid'Oraisa) he did not acquire.</p>
<p class="bas indent2"><span class="nm">1.</span>Shmuel and Ula did not answer like Rav, for the Mishnah does not explicitly say that it discusses a Kohen or Levi to whom Reuven always gives;</p>
<p class="bas indent2"><span class="nm">2.</span>Rav and Ula did not answer like Shmuel, for the Mishnah does not explicitly say that someone else acquires on their behalf.</p>
<p class="bas indent2"><span class="nm">3.</span>Rav and Shmuel did not answer like Ula, for they do not want to establish our Mishnah like an individual's opinion.</p>
<p class="bas indent1"><span class="nm">(f)</span><span class="cl">(Beraisa):</span> If Reuven lent money to Shimon, on condition that Reuven will keep the tithes due to Shimon and deduct their value from the loan, he may do this, and presume that Shimon is still alive.</p>
<p class="bas indent2"><span class="nm">1.</span>He may stipulate that the tithes will be purchased at the lower price (if the price goes down). This is not interest.</p>
<p class="bas indent2"><span class="nm">2.</span>Shemitah does not cancel this loan. If he wants to cancel the deal, he cannot.</p>
<p class="bas indent2"><span class="nm">3.</span>If Reuven despaired (he thought that the tithes on his crops would not equal the value of the debt), he cannot continue to keep the tithes as payment for the loan, for it is as if the loan was lost.</p>
<p class="bas indent1"><span class="nm">(g)</span><span class="cl">Question:</span> The Beraisa says that he may stipulate that the tithes will be purchased at the lower price. This is obvious! (Anyone who pays in advance may do so!)</p>
<p class="bas indent1"><span class="nm">(h)</span><span class="cl">Answer:</span> The Beraisa teaches that even if he did not explicitly stipulate, it is as if he did.</p>
<p class="bas indent1"><span class="nm">(i)</span><span class="cl">Question:</span> Why is it not a problem of interest?</p>
<p class="bas indent1"><span class="nm">(j)</span><span class="cl">Answer:</span> Even though Reuven could gain (if the price goes down), since he could also lose, i.e. if the tithes will not equal the value of the loan, it is permitted.</p>
<p class="bas indent2"><span class="nm">1.</span>Shemitah does not cancel this loan because Reuven was not able to ask Shimon to pay back.</p>
<p class="bas indent1"><span class="nm">(k)</span><span class="cl">(Beraisa):</span> If he wants to cancel the deal, he cannot.</p>
<p class="bas indent1"><span class="nm">(l)</span><span class="cl">(Rav Papa):</span> This applies only to Reuven. Shimon can cancel the deal.</p>
<p class="bas indent2"><span class="nm">1.</span><span class="cl">(Mishnah):</span> If a buyer gave coins to the seller, but the buyer did not yet drag the merchandise, the seller can retract the deal. (It is as if Shimon acquired them, and Reuven did not do Meshichah to take them back.)</p>
<p class="bas indent1"><span class="nm">(m)</span><span class="cl">(Beraisa):</span> If Reuven despaired, he cannot continue to keep the tithes as payment for the loan, since it is as if the loan was lost.</p>
<p class="bas indent1"><span class="nm">(n)</span><span class="cl">Question:</span> This is obvious!</p>
<p class="bas indent1"><span class="nm">(o)</span><span class="cl">Answer:</span> This is a Chidush when the grain withered after having grown on the stalk, and he despaired;</p>
<p class="bas indent2"><span class="nm">1.</span>One might have thought that since it grew on the stalk, it will surely grow, and his despair does not take effect. The Beraisa teaches that this is not so.</p>
<p class="bas subject"><span class="nm">4)</span>IF THE BORROWER DIED</p>
<p class="bas indent1"><span class="nm">(a)</span><span class="cl">(Beraisa - R. Eliezer ben Yakov):</span> If Reuven lent money to a Kohen or Levi in Beis Din, and the Kohen or Levi died, Reuven may continue to keep Terumah or Ma'aser and deduct their value from the loan.</p>
<p class="bas indent2"><span class="nm">1.</span>It is as if the deal continues with other Kohanim or Leviyim (Rashi - the borrower's heirs).</p>
<p class="bas indent1"><span class="nm">(b)</span>If he lent to Shimon (an Oni), and Shimon died, Reuven may continue to keep Ma'aser Oni and deduct its value from the loan.</p>
<p class="bas indent2"><span class="nm">1.</span>We consider it as if other Aniyim of Yisrael agree to continue the deal;</p>
<p class="bas indent2"><span class="nm">2.</span>R. Achai says, we consider it as if other Aniyim of the world agree to continue the deal.</p>
<p class="bas indent2"><span class="nm">3.</span><span class="cl">Question:</span> What is the difference between the two opinions?</p>
<p class="bas bbbline">30b----------------------------------------30b</p>
<p class="bas indent2"><span class="nm">4.</span><span class="cl">Answer:</span> They argue about whether or not we may rely on poor Kusim of the city. (R. Eliezer ben Yakov forbids, for he holds that their conversion was invalid. R. Achai permits, for he holds that their conversion was valid.)</p>
<p class="bas indent1"><span class="nm">(c)</span>If Shimon became rich, Reuven may no longer keep the tithes. Shimon need not pay back the remainder of the loan.</p>
<p class="bas indent1"><span class="nm">(d)</span><span class="cl">Question:</span> Chachamim enacted that Reuven can continue keeping tithes if Shimon died. Why didn't they enact similarly, in case he becomes rich?</p>
<p class="bas indent1"><span class="nm">(e)</span><span class="cl">Answer:</span> Death is common. An Oni rarely becomes rich.</p>
<p class="bas indent2"><span class="nm">1.</span><span class="cl">(Rav Papa):</span> This is like people say, if you hear about a death, believe it. If you hear that one became rich, do not believe it.</p>
<p class="bas indent1"><span class="nm">(f)</span><span class="cl">(Mishnah):</span> If he hears that Shimon died, he must ask Shimon's heirs for permission to continue the deal.</p>
<p class="bas indent1"><span class="nm">(g)</span><span class="cl">(Beraisa - Rebbi):</span> The Mishnah discusses heirs who inherited.</p>
<p class="bas indent2"><span class="nm">1.</span><span class="cl">Question:</span> Are there heirs who do not inherit?!</p>
<p class="bas indent2"><span class="nm">2.</span><span class="cl">Answer (R. Yochanan):</span> He means that they inherited land, not (only) money.</p>
<p class="bas indent1"><span class="nm">(h)</span><span class="cl">(R. Yonason):</span> Reuven can withhold tithes only up to the value of the land that Shimon left over.</p>
<p class="bas indent1"><span class="nm">(i)</span><span class="cl">(R. Yochanan):</span> Even if Shimon left over land the size of a needle, Reuven may withhold the full balance of the loan.</p>
<p class="bas indent2"><span class="nm">1.</span>This is like we learned from a ruling of Abaye, that one may repeatedly collect (parts of) a debt from the same piece of land. (Therefore, any debt can be collected from even a tiny piece of land.)</p>
<p class="bas subject"><span class="nm">5)</span>A YISRAEL HOLDING <i>MA'ASER</i></p>
<p class="bas indent1"><span class="nm">(a)</span><span class="cl">(Beraisa):</span> If Reuven (a Yisrael) told Shimon (a Levi) 'I have Ma'aser of yours' we are not concerned for the Terumas Ma'aser contained inside;</p>
<p class="bas indent2"><span class="nm">1.</span>If he said 'I have one Kor of Ma'aser of yours', we are concerned for the Terumas Ma'aser inside.</p>
<p class="bas indent1"><span class="nm">(b)</span><span class="cl">Question:</span> What does this mean?</p>
<p class="bas indent1"><span class="nm">(c)</span><span class="cl">Answer #1 (Abaye):</span> If Reuven tells Shimon 'I have Ma'aser of yours. Let me buy it (and Reuven gives him money)', we are not concerned lest Shimon declared the Ma'aser to be Terumas Ma'aser to exempt other Ma'aser of Shimon;</p>
<p class="bas indent2"><span class="nm">1.</span>If he said 'I have one Kor of Ma'aser of yours. Let me buy it', we are concerned lest Shimon declared the Ma'aser to be Terumas Ma'aser.</p>
<p class="bas indent1"><span class="nm">(d)</span><span class="cl">Objection:</span> Does the Beraisa discuss Resha'im, i.e. that Shimon would take the money after he declared the Ma'aser to be Terumas Ma'aser (and it must be given to a Kohen)?!</p>
<p class="bas indent1"><span class="nm">(e)</span><span class="cl">Answer #2 (Rav Mesharshiya brei d'Rav Idi):</span> If Reuven tells Shimon 'I have Ma'aser of your father. Let me buy it', we are not concerned lest Shimon's father declared the Ma'aser to be Terumas Ma'aser to exempt other Ma'aser;</p>
<p class="bas indent2"><span class="nm">1.</span>If he said 'I have one Kor of Ma'aser of your father, let me buy it', we are concerned lest Shimon's father declared the Ma'aser to be Terumas Ma'aser.</p>
<p class="bas indent1"><span class="nm">(f)</span><span class="cl">Objection:</span> We do not suspect Chaverim (trustworthy people) to separate Terumah not near the produce being exempted!</p>
<p class="bas indent1"><span class="nm">(g)</span><span class="cl">Answer #3 (Rav Ashi):</span> If Reuven tells Shimon 'my father told me that he has Ma'aser of yours or of your father', we are concerned that Terumas Ma'aser has not been separated from it;</p>
<p class="bas indent2"><span class="nm">1.</span>If he said 'my father told me that he has one Kor of Ma'aser of yours or of your father', we assume that Terumas Ma'aser has been separated;</p>
<p class="bas indent2"><span class="nm">2.</span>Since the quantity was known, Reuven's father certainly tithed it so it will be permitted.</p>
<p class="bas indent1"><span class="nm">(h)</span><span class="cl">Question:</span> May a Yisrael separate Terumas Ma'aser?! (The Ma'aser is not his!)</p>
<p class="bas indent1"><span class="nm">(i)</span><span class="cl">Answer:</span> Yes! The Beraisa is like Aba Elazar ben Gamla:</p>
<p class="bas indent2"><span class="nm">1.</span><span class="cl">(Beraisa - Aba Elazar ben Gamla):</span> "Your Terumos will be considered to you" - the verse discusses two Terumos, Terumah Gedolah and Terumas Ma'aser;</p>
<p class="bas indent2"><span class="nm">2.</span>Just like Terumah Gedolah is separated by estimation and by thought alone, also Terumas Ma'aser;</p>
<p class="bas indent2"><span class="nm">3.</span>Just like a landowner may separate Terumah Gedolah on his own produce, he may also separate Terumas Ma'aser.</p>
