<p class="bas indent1"><span class="nm">(a)</span><span class="cl">(Beraisa):</span> We may not export life-essential Peros of Eretz Yisrael such as wine, oil and flour;</p>
<p class="bas indent1"><span class="nm">(b)</span>R. Yehudah ben Beseira permits exporting wine. This reduces (drunkenness and) immorality.</p>
<p class="bas indent1"><span class="nm">(c)</span>Just like we may not export to Chutz la'Aretz, we may not export to Surya;</p>
<p class="bas indent1"><span class="nm">(d)</span>Rebbi permits exporting from a town of Eretz Yisrael to a nearby town of Surya.</p>
<p class="bas indent1"><span class="nm">(e)</span><span class="cl">(Beraisa):</span> We may not deal (buy in order to resell at a profit) in life-essential Peros of Eretz Yisrael such as wine, oil and flour;</p>
<p class="bas indent2"><span class="nm">1.</span>R. Elazar ben Azaryah used to deal in wine and oil.</p>
<p class="bas indent2"><span class="nm">2.</span>Regarding wine, he holds like R. Yehudah ben Beseira;</p>
<p class="bas indent2"><span class="nm">3.</span>Oil was plentiful in his area (so it was permitted to deal in it).</p>
<p class="bas indent1"><span class="nm">(f)</span><span class="cl">(Beraisa):</span> One may not make a double profit on eggs.</p>
<p class="bas indent1"><span class="nm">(g)</span><span class="cl">(Mari bar Mari):</span> Rav and Shmuel argue about this:</p>
<p class="bas indent2"><span class="nm">1.</span>One explains that one may not buy and resell them (Tosfos - one may not sell even his own eggs) for double the price;</p>
<p class="bas indent2"><span class="nm">2.</span>The other explains that one may not buy and resell them to a second dealer. (Rather, he must sell them for consumption.)</p>
<p class="bas indent1"><span class="nm">(h)</span><span class="cl">(Beraisa):</span> We are Masri'a (Rashbam - cry out in prayer; Tur - blow the Shofar) due to a drop in prices of merchandise, even on Shabbos.</p>
<p class="bas indent1"><span class="nm">(i)</span><span class="cl">(R. Yochanan):</span> Examples of this are a drop in prices of linen garments in Bavel, or wine and oil in Eretz Yisrael.</p>
<p class="bas indent1"><span class="nm">(j)</span><span class="cl">(Rav Yosef):</span> This is if what normally sells for 10 now sells for six.</p>
<p class="bas indent1"><span class="nm">(k)</span><span class="cl">(Beraisa):</span> One may not leave Eretz Yisrael (due to inflated prices) until wheat sells for Sa'atayim for a Sela;</p>
<p class="bas indent1"><span class="nm">(l)</span>R. Shimon says, this is when he cannot afford to buy. If he can afford, even if it sells for a Se'ah for a Sela, he may not leave.</p>
<p class="bas indent2"><span class="nm">1.</span><span class="cl">R. Shimon:</span> Elimelech, Machlon and Chilyon were the leaders of their generation and the philanthropists of their generation. They were punished for leaving Eretz Yisrael - "va'Tehom Kol ha'Ir... ha'Zos No'omi."</p>
<p class="bas subject"><span class="nm">2)</span>ELIMELECH AND RELATED AGADATA</p>
<p class="bas indent1"><span class="nm">(a)</span><span class="cl">Question:</span> What does it mean "Ha'Zos No'omi"?</p>
<p class="bas indent1"><span class="nm">(b)</span><span class="cl">Answer (R. Yitzchak):</span> This hints to 'CHaZiSem No'omi', (have you seen what happened to her for leaving Eretz Yisrael?)</p>
<p class="bas indent1"><span class="nm">(c)</span><span class="cl">(R. Yitzchak):</span> The day Rus came to Eretz Yisrael, Boaz' wife died;</p>
<p class="bas indent2"><span class="nm">1.</span>Before someone dies, his replacement is prepared.</p>
<p class="bas indent1"><span class="nm">(d)</span><span class="cl">(Rabah bar Rav Huna):</span> (The Shofet) Ivtzan is Bo'az.</p>
<p class="bas indent1"><span class="nm">(e)</span><span class="cl">Question:</span> What do we learn from this?</p>
<p class="bas indent1"><span class="nm">(f)</span><span class="cl">Answer:</span> This and Rabah bar Rav Huna's other teaching are needed to learn (5) below.</p>
<p class="bas indent2"><span class="nm">1.</span><span class="cl">(Rabah bar Rav Huna):</span> Bo'az made 120 feasts for his children - "...U'Shloshim Banos Shilach ha'Chutzah u'Shloshim Banos Hevi l'Vanav";</p>
<p class="bas indent2"><span class="nm">2.</span>For each child he made one feast in the Chasan's house, and one in the house of the Kalah's father.</p>
<p class="bas indent2"><span class="nm">3.</span>He did not invite Mano'ach to even one of them. He reasoned 'since he is sterile, he will never have occasion to invite me to such a feast!' (Maharsha - the custom was to bring gifts to the feast, and the host returns such gifts when the guest makes a wedding feast. Bo'az did not want to receive a gift that he would be unable to return.)</p>
<p class="bas indent2"><span class="nm">4.</span>All 60 children died in Bo'az' lifetime.</p>
<p class="bas indent2"><span class="nm">5.</span>This is like people say, 'what gain is there in 60 children who will die?! I t is better to remarry and have one child who will be zealous!'</p>
<p class="bas indent2"><span class="nm">6.</span><span class="cl">(Rav Chanan bar Rava):</span> Elimelech, Salmon, Ploni Almoni and No'omi's father all descended from Nachshon ben Aminadav.</p>
<p class="bas indent1"><span class="nm">(g)</span><span class="cl">Question:</span> What do we learn from this?</p>
<p class="bas indent1"><span class="nm">(h)</span><span class="cl">Answer:</span> Even great merits of one's fathers do not help him if he goes to Chutz la'Aretz.</p>
<p class="bas indent1"><span class="nm">(i)</span><span class="cl">(Rav Chanan bar Rava):</span> Avraham's mother was called Amaslai bas Karnevo; Haman's mother was called Amaslai bas Orvasai;</p>
<p class="bas indent1"><span class="nm">(j)</span>A way to remember this is that Tamei comes from Tamei (Orvasai is like Orev (raven)), and Tahor comes from Tahor (Karnevo is an expression of Karim (pillows, which come from wool of sheep)).</p>
<p class="bas indent1"><span class="nm">(k)</span>David's mother was Nitzvas bas Ad'el; Shimshon's mother was Hatzlelfoni; his sister was Nashyin.</p>
<p class="bas indent1"><span class="nm">(l)</span><span class="cl">Question:</span> Why must we know this?</p>
<p class="bas indent1"><span class="nm">(m)</span><span class="cl">Answer:</span> This helps us answer heretics, who ask these questions.</p>
<p class="bas indent1"><span class="nm">(n)</span><span class="cl">(Rav Chanan bar Rava):</span> Avraham was imprisoned for 10 years, three in Kusa, and seven in Kardo (Ararat. Rav Dimi taught vice-versa.)</p>
<p class="bas indent1"><span class="nm">(o)</span><span class="cl">(Rav Chisda):</span> Ivra Ze'ira of Kusa is Or Kasdim.</p>
<p class="bas indent1"><span class="nm">(p)</span><span class="cl">(Rav Chanan bar Rava):</span> The day that Avraham died, all the important Nochrim bewailed 'the world lost its leader, and the ship lost its captain!</p>
<p class="bas bbbline">91b----------------------------------------91b</p>
<p class="bas indent1"><span class="nm">(q)</span><span class="cl">(Rav Chanan bar Rava):</span> "Veha'Misnasei l'Chol l'Rosh" - even the overseer of who draws water from the pit is appointed from Heaven.</p>
<p class="bas subject"><span class="nm">3)</span>FAMINE, AND NOSTALGIA</p>
<p class="bas indent1"><span class="nm">(a)</span><span class="cl">(R. Chiya bar Avin):</span> Elimelech and his family would not have left Eretz Yisrael had they found food, even bran!</p>
<p class="bas indent2"><span class="nm">1.</span>They were punished because they did not pray for their generation - "b'Za'akech Yatziluch Kibutzayich."</p>
<p class="bas indent1"><span class="nm">(b)</span><span class="cl">(Rabah bar bar Chanah):</span> Permission to leave Eretz Yisrael depends on the price of grain only when money is cheap and Peros are expensive, but if money is scarce, even if four Se'im sell for a Sela, one may leave.</p>
<p class="bas indent2"><span class="nm">1.</span><span class="cl">(R. Yochanan):</span> I remember when four Se'im sold for a Sela, and many people had swelled stomachs from hunger in Teveryah, because money was scarce.</p>
<p class="bas indent2"><span class="nm">2.</span>I remember when workers would refuse to work in the east part of the city, because they would die from the smell of bread.</p>
<p class="bas indent2"><span class="nm">3.</span>I remember when a child would cut a carob and honey would spurt on his arms.</p>
<p class="bas indent1"><span class="nm">(c)</span><span class="cl">(R. Elazar):</span> I remember when a raven would take meat, and a stream of fat would extend from the wall (of the city) to the ground.</p>
<p class="bas indent1"><span class="nm">(d)</span><span class="cl">(R. Yochanan):</span> I remember when boys 16 or 17 years old would play together with girls and not sin.</p>
<p class="bas indent1"><span class="nm">(e)</span><span class="cl">(R. Yochanan):</span> I remember that they would say in the Beis Midrash 'one who admits to (flatters) idolaters will fall to them.' (Rather, one must refute everything they say.)</p>
<p class="bas indent2"><span class="nm">1.</span>If one trusts that they will not harm him and lets them see what he has, they will take all he owns.</p>
<p class="bas subject"><span class="nm">4)</span>EXPOUNDING NAMES AND VERSES ABOUT RUTH</p>
<p class="bas indent1"><span class="nm">(a)</span><span class="cl">Question:</span> In Megilas Rus, Elimelech's children are called Machlon and Chilyon. In Divrei ha'Yamim, they are called Yo'ash and Saraf!</p>
<p class="bas indent1"><span class="nm">(b)</span><span class="cl">Answer #1 (Rav or Shmuel):</span> Their real names were Machlon and Chilyon. They are called Yo'ash and Saraf because they Nisya'ashu (despaired) of Yeshu'ah (salvation) and were worthy to be Nisrafim (burned).</p>
<p class="bas indent1"><span class="nm">(c)</span><span class="cl">Answer #2 (The other of Rav and Shmuel):</span> Their real names were Yo'ash and Saraf. They are called Machlon and Chilyon because they made themselves Chulin and were worthy of Kelayah (to be wiped out).</p>
<p class="bas indent1"><span class="nm">(d)</span><span class="cl">Support (for the first opinion - Beraisa):</span> (A verse lists people of Yehudah.) "V'Yokim" is Yehoshua (perhaps his mother was from Yehudah), who was Mekim (fulfilled) the oath to the Givonim. "V'Anshei Chozeva" are the Givonim, who lied (Kazvu) to Yehoshua. "V'Yo'ash v'Saraf" are Machlon and Chilyon;</p>
<p class="bas indent2"><span class="nm">1.</span>They are called Yo'ash and Saraf because they despaired of salvation and were worthy to be burned.</p>
<p class="bas indent1"><span class="nm">(e)</span>"Asher Bo'alu l'Mo'av" - they married Moabite women. "V'Yashuvi Lechem" refers to Rus, who returned and clung to Beis Lechem. "Veha'Devarim Atikim" - these matters were said by the Ancient One of the World;</p>
<p class="bas indent2"><span class="nm">1.</span>It says "Motzasi David Avdi", and "Shtei Venosecha ha'Nimtza'os." David and (Shlomo's son Rechavam) descended from Lot's daughters, who were saved (and permitted to marry into Yisrael, unlike men of Amon and Mo'av).</p>
<p class="bas indent1"><span class="nm">(f)</span>"Hemah ha'Yotzerim" are the children of Yonadav (descendants of Yisro), who guarded their father's oath (not to drink wine - Yirmeyahu 35:14). "V'Yoshevei Neta'im" refers to Shlomo, who was like a sapling regarding kingship (he grew greatly). "U'Gderah" refers to the Sanhedrin, who fenced the breaches in Yisrael. "Im ha'Melech bi'Mlachto Yoshvu Sham" refers to Rus, who saw the kingship of Shlomo, her grandson's grandson.</p>
<p class="bas indent2"><span class="nm">1.</span><span class="cl">(R. Elazar):</span> "Va'Yasem Kisei l'Em ha'Melech" was for Rus, the mother of the kingly line.</p>
<p class="bas indent1"><span class="nm">(g)</span><span class="cl">(Beraisa):</span> "Va'Achaltem Min ha'Tevu'ah Yashan (you will eat old grain)" - without Salamanton.</p>
<p class="bas indent1"><span class="nm">(h)</span><span class="cl">Question:</span> What does this mean?</p>
<p class="bas indent1"><span class="nm">(i)</span><span class="cl">Answer #1 (Rav Nachman):</span> Worms will not make it rot.</p>
<p class="bas indent1"><span class="nm">(j)</span><span class="cl">Answer #2 (Rav Sheshes):</span> Hot winds will not prevent you from aging it.</p>
<p class="bas indent1"><span class="nm">(k)</span><span class="cl">Support (for Rav Nachman - Beraisa) Suggestion:</span> "Va'Achaltem... Yashan" - perhaps Yisrael will hope for new grain because old grain ceased (through worms)!</p>
<p class="bas indent2"><span class="nm">1.</span><span class="cl">Rejection:</span> "Ad Bo Tevu'asah" - you (will not be rushed to harvest. You) will wait until it is properly ripened.</p>
<p class="bas indent1"><span class="nm">(l)</span><span class="cl">Support (for Rav Sheshes - Beraisa) Suggestion:</span> "Va'Achaltem... Yashan" - perhaps Yisrael will hope for new grain because the old grain is bad (due to hot winds)!</p>
<p class="bas indent2"><span class="nm">1.</span><span class="cl">Rejection:</span> "Ad Bo Tevu'asah" - you will wait until it is properly ripened.</p>
<p class="bas indent1"><span class="nm">(m)</span><span class="cl">(Beraisa):</span> "Va'Achaltem Yashan Noshan" teaches that older grain is better.</p>
<p class="bas indent2"><span class="nm">1.</span><span class="cl">Suggestion:</span> Perhaps that applies only to things that are normally aged.</p>
<p class="bas indent2"><span class="nm">2.</span><span class="cl">Rejection:</span> "Yashan Noshan" teaches about even things that are not normally aged.</p>
<p class="bas indent2"><span class="nm">3.</span>"V'Yashan Mipenei Chadash Totzi'u" teaches that all the storehouses will be full of old Peros, and the granaries will be full of new Peros, and Yisrael say 'how can we clear out the old, to make room for the (inferior) new?!'</p>
<p class="bas indent1"><span class="nm">(n)</span><span class="cl">(Rav Papa):</span> Everything is better when it is old, except for dates, beer and small fish.</p>
