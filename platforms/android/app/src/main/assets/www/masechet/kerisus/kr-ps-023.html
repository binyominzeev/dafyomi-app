<p class="bas subject"><span class="nm">2)</span>ME'ILAH FOR NOSAR</p>
<p class="bas indent1"><span class="nm">(a)</span><span class="cl">(Gemara - Rava) Inference:</span> R. Yosi says that two people cannot bring one Chatas. Rather, each brings Asham Taluy.</p>
<p class="bas indent1"><span class="nm">(b)</span><span class="cl">Question:</span> This is just like the first Tana!</p>
<p class="bas indent2"><span class="nm">1.</span><span class="cl">Suggestion:</span> The first Tana obligates Asham Taluy even when there was only one piece. R. Yosi obligates only when there were two pieces (he exempts the second eater).</p>
<p class="bas indent2"><span class="nm">2.</span><span class="cl">Rejection (Beraisa - R. Yosi):</span> Each of them brings Asham Taluy.</p>
<p class="bas indent1"><span class="nm">(c)</span><span class="cl">Answer (Rav Nachman):</span> This teaches that R. Yosi is the first Tana.</p>
<p class="bas indent1"><span class="nm">(d)</span><span class="cl">(Mishnah):</span> If there was a piece of Chelev and a piece of Kodesh... a piece of Chelev and a piece of Chelev Kodesh... a piece of Chelev and a piece of Chelev Nosar...</p>
<p class="bas indent1"><span class="nm">(e)</span><span class="cl">Question (Rava):</span> He should also bring an Asham Vadai (for Me'ilah), for Nosar is Kodesh! (Shitah - he refers to the Seifa, in which he ate Chelev and Chelev Nosar.)</p>
<p class="bas indent1"><span class="nm">(f)</span><span class="cl">Answer (Rav Nachman):</span> It is not worth a Perutah.</p>
<p class="bas indent1"><span class="nm">(g)</span><span class="cl">Question (Rava):</span> Surely, the Seifa is like the previous case (Chelev and Chelev Kodesh). There, it is worth a Perutah, for he brings an Asham Vadai!</p>
<p class="bas indent1"><span class="nm">(h)</span><span class="cl">Answer (Rav Nachman):</span> It was worth a Perutah, but after it becomes Nosar, it is not worth a Perutah. (After one or two days and a night, it is almost spoiled. R. Gershom explains that it is Asur even to the Mizbe'ach. The next question refutes this. We must say that the subsequent answers attribute the decreased value to spoilage.)</p>
<p class="bas indent1"><span class="nm">(i)</span><span class="cl">Question (Rava - Mishnah #1):</span> One can be liable for four Chata'os and one Asham for one eating. (A Tamei ate Chelev Nosar on Yom Kipur.)</p>
<p class="bas indent2"><span class="nm">1.</span>The Asham is for Me'ilah. The Nosar is worth a Perutah!</p>
<p class="bas indent1"><span class="nm">(j)</span><span class="cl">Version #1 (Rashi) Answer #1 (Rav Nachman):</span> There, he ate a lot. (It was at least k'Koseves, to be liable for Yom Kipur), so it was worth a Perutah. Here, he ate a little.</p>
<p class="bas indent1"><span class="nm">(k)</span><span class="cl">Version #2 (R. Gershom) Answer #1 (Rav Nachman):</span> There, it was Chelev of a large animal (it is worth more; Rashash - it is slow to spoil). Here, it was Chelev of a small animal (it is worth less or spoils quicker). (end of Version #2)</p>
<p class="bas indent1"><span class="nm">(l)</span><span class="cl">Answer #2 (Rav Nachman):</span> There, it was winter (when fat takes longer to spoil). Here it was summer. (Most opinions (including R. Meir, who agrees with Mishnah #1) say that Yom Kipur is in Chom (heat, the end of summer - Bava Metzi'a 106b), the hottest season (Yoma 29a)! Rav Nachman must mean that it happened to be a cold day. A Kohen Gadol may not be a judge for Ibur Shanah, for he does not want a leap year to delay Yom Kipur, lest it be cold (Sanhedrin 18b). Additionally, perhaps the Chelev (after Shechitah) did not see daytime heat (e.g. Kodshei Kodashim offered late Erev Yom Kipur and eaten early the next morning), or it was preserved through salting or smoking. The Tana sought to maximize the number of Korbanos, but normally, Nosar is not worth a Perutah.)</p>
<p class="bas subject"><span class="nm">3)</span>IS ISUR CHAL AL ISUR FOR KODSHIM?</p>
<p class="bas indent1"><span class="nm">(a)</span><span class="cl">(Mishnah):</span> If two different people ate (Chelev and Chelev Nosar... R. Shimon says, each brings a Chatas, and together they bring a (third) Chatas).</p>
<p class="bas indent1"><span class="nm">(b)</span><span class="cl">Question (Rava):</span> Why does R. Shimon Mechayev for Nosar? He holds that Ein Isur Chal Al Isur! (It should not take effect on Chelev.)</p>
<p class="bas indent2"><span class="nm">1.</span><span class="cl">(Beraisa - R. Shimon):</span> If one ate a Nevelah on Yom Kipur, he is exempt (from punishment for eating on Yom Kipur, since the Nevelah was forbidden before Yom Kipur. Even if the animal died on Yom Kipur, it was forbidden beforehand because it was not slaughtered.)</p>
<p class="bas indent1"><span class="nm">(c)</span><span class="cl">Answer #1 (Rav Shisha brei d'Rav Idi):</span> The case is, he ate a kidney with the Chelev on it. (Nosar takes effect on the kidney, since it was initially permitted.)</p>
<p class="bas indent1"><span class="nm">(d)</span><span class="cl">Question:</span> Even the kidney was forbidden, for it is Olim! (It is part of the Eimurim offered to Hash-m.)</p>
<p class="bas indent2"><span class="nm">1.</span><span class="cl">Suggestion:</span> Perhaps R. Shimon holds that a more severe Isur (Nosar, which has Kares) is Chal on a light Isur (Olim).</p>
<p class="bas indent2"><span class="nm">2.</span><span class="cl">Rejection:</span> Yom Kipur (entails Kares, which) is more severe than Nevelah (a Lav), and it is not Chal on it!</p>
<p class="bas indent1"><span class="nm">(e)</span><span class="cl">Answer #2:</span> Rather, (even R. Shimon agrees that) regarding Kodshim, the Torah teaches that Isur Chal Al Isur:</p>
<p class="bas bbbline">23b----------------------------------------23b</p>
<p class="bas indent2"><span class="nm">1.</span><span class="cl">(Beraisa):</span> "Asher la'Shem" includes (all) Eimurim. (One is liable for eating them b'Tum'ah.)</p>
<p class="bas indent2"><span class="nm">2.</span>Even though Eimurim are forbidden (they are Olim), and the Chelev (punishable by Kares) is included, the Isur Tum'ah is Chal on them!</p>
<p class="bas indent1"><span class="nm">(f)</span><span class="cl">Support:</span> Rebbi holds that a severe Isur is Chal on a light Isur, but not vice-versa. In Kodshim, he holds that even a light Isur is Chal on a severe Isur!</p>
<p class="bas indent2"><span class="nm">1.</span>Me'ilah is a light Isur. It is Misah b'Yedei Shamayim (according to Rebbi; Chachamim say that it is only a Lav), yet Rebbi says that it is Chal on Kodshim with a more severe Isur (Kares)!</p>
<p class="bas indent2"><span class="nm">2.</span><span class="cl">(Beraisa - Rebbi):</span> "Kol Chelev la'Shem" includes (all) Eimurim of Kodshim Kalim (Me'ilah applies to them), even though Chelev is forbidden by Kares!</p>
<p class="bas indent2"><span class="nm">3.</span><span class="cl">Conclusion:</span> All agree that in Kodshim, Isur Chal Al Isur.</p>
<p class="bas indent1"><span class="nm">(g)</span><span class="cl">Question (Beraisa - R. Shimon):</span> Pigul and Nosar do not apply to Olim (because Ein Isur Chal Al Isur).</p>
<p class="bas indent1"><span class="nm">(h)</span><span class="cl">Answer #3:</span> Tana'im argue about whether R. Shimon agrees that Isur Chal Al Isur in Kodshim. (The Tana of this Beraisa says that he does. The Tana of our Mishnah says that he does not.)</p>
<p class="bas indent1"><span class="nm">(i)</span><span class="cl">Question:</span> According to this Tana (that Ein Isur Chal Al Isur, even in Kodshim), what do we learn from "Kol Chelev la'Shem"?</p>
<p class="bas indent1"><span class="nm">(j)</span><span class="cl">Answer:</span> It applies to Vlados Kodshim. He holds that they do not become Kodesh until they are born. The Isurim of Me'ilah and Chelev come at the same time.</p>
<p class="perekline">PEREK HA'MEVI ASHAM</p>
<p class="bas subject"><span class="nm">4)</span>ONE WHO LATER LEARNED THAT HE DID NOT SIN</p>
<p class="bas indent1"><span class="nm">(a)</span><span class="cl">(Mishnah - R. Meir):</span> If one was Makdish an Asham Taluy and found out before Shechitah that he did not sin, he returns it to his flock. (It is Chulin);</p>
<p class="bas indent1"><span class="nm">(b)</span>Chachamim say, it grazes (this always means until it gets a Mum; it is redeemed, and its money goes to Nedavah);</p>
<p class="bas indent1"><span class="nm">(c)</span>R. Eliezer says, he offers it. If he does not need it for this Safek, it can be for another sin (even if he has no doubts about any other sin).</p>
<p class="bas indent1"><span class="nm">(d)</span>If he found out after Shechitah, (it is Pasul;) the blood is spilled into the Amah, the meat is burned in Beis ha'Sereifah;</p>
<p class="bas indent1"><span class="nm">(e)</span>If the blood was thrown (before he found out), the meat is eaten;</p>
<p class="bas indent1"><span class="nm">(f)</span>R. Yosi says, even if the blood is in a bucket, (the Asham is Kosher, for it was already Mechaper as if the blood was already thrown;) we do Zerikah and the meat is eaten.</p>
<p class="bas indent1"><span class="nm">(g)</span>Asham Vadai is different. If one found out before Shechitah that he did not sin, (Chachamim agree that it is Chulin;) he returns it to his flock;</p>
<p class="bas indent1"><span class="nm">(h)</span>If he found out after Shechitah, it is buried;</p>
<p class="bas indent1"><span class="nm">(i)</span>If the blood was thrown, the meat is burned in Beis ha'Sereifah.</p>
<p class="bas indent1"><span class="nm">(j)</span>Shor ha'Niskal (an ox sentenced to be stoned) is different (than Asham Taluy). If we find out before stoning it (that it did not kill, it is permitted). He returns it to his flock;</p>
<p class="bas indent2"><span class="nm">1.</span>If we find out after stoning, it is permitted to benefit from it;</p>
<p class="bas indent1"><span class="nm">(k)</span>Eglah Arufah (a calf beheaded when a murdered corpse is found) is different (than Asham Taluy). If we find the murderer before Arifah, (it is permitted,) and it returns to the flock;</p>
<p class="bas indent2"><span class="nm">1.</span>If we find him after Arifah, it is buried in its place;</p>
<p class="bas indent2"><span class="nm">2.</span>This is because from the beginning, it was brought due to Safek. It atoned for the Safek.</p>
<p class="bas indent1"><span class="nm">(l)</span><span class="cl">(Gemara) Question:</span> What do they argue about?</p>
<p class="bas indent1"><span class="nm">(m)</span><span class="cl">Answer:</span> R. Meir holds that one is not Makdish something if he will not need it. Chachamim say, he is worried lest he sinned and is anxious to bring the Asham, therefore he is Makdish absolutely (unconditionally).</p>
<p class="bas indent1"><span class="nm">(n)</span><span class="cl">(Beraisa):</span> R. Meir and Chachamim argue both when he found out that he sinned, and when he found out that he did not sin:</p>
<p class="bas indent2"><span class="nm">1.</span>They argue when he found out that he sinned to teach the extremity of R. Meir. Even though he really needs Kaparah, and the Asham would have protected him (while he was in doubt), since he need not bring it now (only a Chatas), he did not intend to be Makdish it in such a case (Aruch l'Ner);</p>
<p class="bas indent2"><span class="nm">2.</span>They argue when he found out that he did not sin to teach the extremity of Chachamim. Even though he needs no Kaparah, since he did not know this at the time, he was Makdish absolutely.</p>
