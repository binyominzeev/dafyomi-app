<p class="bas subject"><span class="nm">1)</span>A KOHEN WHO WAS MAKDISH HIS SEDEH CHEREM</p>
<p class="bas indent1"><span class="nm">(a)</span><span class="cl">(Beraisa) Question:</span> What do we learn from "ki'Sedeh ha'Cherem la'Kohen Tihyeh Achuzaso"?</p>
<p class="bas indent2"><span class="nm">1.</span><span class="cl">Answer - Suggestion:</span> If a Kohen was Makdish his Sedeh Cherem, perhaps he can say "I acquire (a share of) others' property (e.g. when a Yisrael was Makdish his Sedeh Achuzah and did not redeem it before Yovel). All the more so, (in Yovel) I should keep this field, which I already have!"</p>
<p class="bas indent2"><span class="nm">2.</span><span class="cl">Rejection:</span> "V'Hayah ha'Sadeh b'Tzeiso va'Yovel Kodesh la'Shem ki'Sedeh ha'Cherem."</p>
<p class="bas indent3"><span class="nm">i.</span><span class="cl">Question:</span> The verse says that Achuzah is like Cherem, but we do not learn Achuzah from Cherem!</p>
<p class="bas indent3"><span class="nm">ii.</span><span class="cl">Answer:</span> Rather, we learn Cherem (of a Kohen) from Achuzah (of a Yisrael). Just like if a Yisrael is Makdish his Achuzah, it is divided among Kohanim in Yovel, the same applies if a Kohen is Makdish his Sedeh Cherem.</p>
<p class="bas indent1"><span class="nm">(b)</span><span class="cl">(Beraisa):</span> "I acquire others' property... "</p>
<p class="bas indent1"><span class="nm">(c)</span><span class="cl">Question:</span> The Kal va'Chomer is invalid. A Kohen gets only a share of unredeemed fields, and this Kohen wants to keep his entire Sedeh Cherem!</p>
<p class="bas indent1"><span class="nm">(d)</span><span class="cl">Answer #1 (Rami bar Chama):</span> One might have thought that since it says "v'Ish Es Kodashav Lo Yihyu" (a Kohen may offer his own Korbanos and receive all the meat and skin, even if it is not his Mishmar), similarly he may keep his own Sedeh Cherem!</p>
<p class="bas indent1"><span class="nm">(e)</span><span class="cl">Objection:</span> There is different. The meat and skin are his reward for offering the Korban. Here he wants to receive the field because it formerly was his!</p>
<p class="bas indent1"><span class="nm">(f)</span><span class="cl">Answer #2 (Rav Nachman) Suggestion:</span> Perhaps "Ki Achuzas Olam Hi Lahem" teaches that a Sedeh Cherem is just like his Achuzah! (I.e. he may redeem it at any time.)</p>
<p class="bas indent2"><span class="nm">1.</span><span class="cl">Rejection:</span> "Achuzaso" teaches that permanent redemption does not apply to Cherem, only to something inherited (from the days of Yehoshua).</p>
