<div class="subject"><span class="nm">1)</span><p>A KOHEN WHO WAS MAKDISH HIS SEDEH CHEREM</p></div>
<div class="indent1"><span class="nm">(a)</span><p><span class="cl">(Beraisa) Question:</span> What do we learn from "ki'Sedeh ha'Cherem la'Kohen Tihyeh Achuzaso"?</p></div>
<div class="indent2"><span class="nm">1.</span><p><span class="cl">Answer - Suggestion:</span> If a Kohen was Makdish his Sedeh Cherem, perhaps he can say "I acquire (a share of) others' property (e.g. when a Yisrael was Makdish his Sedeh Achuzah and did not redeem it before Yovel). All the more so, (in Yovel) I should keep this field, which I already have!"</p></div>
<div class="indent2"><span class="nm">2.</span><p><span class="cl">Rejection:</span> "V'Hayah ha'Sadeh b'Tzeiso va'Yovel Kodesh la'Shem ki'Sedeh ha'Cherem."</p></div>
<div class="indent3"><span class="nm">i.</span><p><span class="cl">Question:</span> The verse says that Achuzah is like Cherem, but we do not learn Achuzah from Cherem!</p></div>
<div class="indent3"><span class="nm">ii.</span><p><span class="cl">Answer:</span> Rather, we learn Cherem (of a Kohen) from Achuzah (of a Yisrael). Just like if a Yisrael is Makdish his Achuzah, it is divided among Kohanim in Yovel, the same applies if a Kohen is Makdish his Sedeh Cherem.</p></div>
<div class="indent1"><span class="nm">(b)</span><p><span class="cl">(Beraisa):</span> "I acquire others' property... "</p></div>
<div class="indent1"><span class="nm">(c)</span><p><span class="cl">Question:</span> The Kal va'Chomer is invalid. A Kohen gets only a share of unredeemed fields, and this Kohen wants to keep his entire Sedeh Cherem!</p></div>
<div class="indent1"><span class="nm">(d)</span><p><span class="cl">Answer #1 (Rami bar Chama):</span> One might have thought that since it says "v'Ish Es Kodashav Lo Yihyu" (a Kohen may offer his own Korbanos and receive all the meat and skin, even if it is not his Mishmar), similarly he may keep his own Sedeh Cherem!</p></div>
<div class="indent1"><span class="nm">(e)</span><p><span class="cl">Objection:</span> There is different. The meat and skin are his reward for offering the Korban. Here he wants to receive the field because it formerly was his!</p></div>
<div class="indent1"><span class="nm">(f)</span><p><span class="cl">Answer #2 (Rav Nachman) Suggestion:</span> Perhaps "Ki Achuzas Olam Hi Lahem" teaches that a Sedeh Cherem is just like his Achuzah! (I.e. he may redeem it at any time.)</p></div>
<div class="indent2"><span class="nm">1.</span><p><span class="cl">Rejection:</span> "Achuzaso" teaches that permanent redemption does not apply to Cherem, only to something inherited (from the days of Yehoshua).</p></div>
