<p class="dedicationbox"><br>12TH CYCLE DEDICATION<br>NEDARIM 16-19 - Two weeks of Dafyomi study material have been dedicated by Ms. Estanne Abraham-Fawer to honor the eighth Yahrzeit of her father, Rav Mordechai ben Eliezer Zvi (Rabbi Morton Weiner) Z'L, who passed away on 18 Teves 5760. May the merit of supporting and advancing Dafyomi study -- which was so important to him -- during the weeks of his Yahrzeit serve as an Iluy for his Neshamah. </p>

<p class="bas subject"><span class="nm">1)</span>IS R. ELIEZER LENIENT ABOUT A <i>SAFEK</i>?</p>
<p class="bas indent1"><span class="nm">(a)</span><span class="cl">Question (Abaye):</span> The Seifa of Mishnah #1 is unlike R. Eliezer!</p>
<p class="bas indent2"><span class="nm">1.</span><span class="cl">(Seifa):</span> Regarding a Safek Bechor, whether human or animal, whether it is a Kosher or Tamei species, the burden of proof (that it is a Bechor) is on the one who wants to take (the Kohen, who wants to get five Shekalim, the animal, or a Seh in place of a donkey).</p>
<p class="bas indent2"><span class="nm">2.</span><span class="cl">(Beraisa):</span> One may not shear (a Safek Bechor Beheimah) or work with it. (We are stringent, unlike R. Eliezer!)</p>
<p class="bas indent1"><span class="nm">(b)</span><span class="cl">Answer (R. Zeira):</span> We are stringent about automatic Kedushah. We are lenient about Kedushah imposed by man (man does not intend to forbid doubtful cases).</p>
<p class="bas indent1"><span class="nm">(c)</span><span class="cl">Question (Beraisa - R. Meir and R. Eliezer):</span> If a liquid became doubtfully Tamei, it has Tum'as Atzman (it itself is  considered Tamei), but it is not Metam'ei other things.</p>
<p class="bas indent2"><span class="nm">1.</span><span class="cl">Contradiction (Beraisa - R. Eliezer):</span> Liquids cannot become Tamei at all (mid'Oraisa).</p>
<p class="bas indent2"><span class="nm">2.</span><span class="cl">Support (R. Eliezer, for himself):</span> Yosi ben Yoezer testified that Ayil Kamtza (a kind of locust) is Kosher, and that liquids (blood and water) of Beis Mitbechai (where they rinse Korbanos) are Tahor. (Tum'ah of liquids is only mid'Rabanan. Chachamim did not decree about them in the Mikdash.)</p>
<p class="bas indent1"><span class="nm">(d)</span><span class="cl">Answer:</span> Shmuel explains 'they are Tahor', i.e. they are not Metam'ei other things, but they have Tum'as Atzman (mid'Oraisa). Therefore, we are stringent about Safek Tum'as Atzman.</p>
<p class="bas indent1"><span class="nm">(e)</span><span class="cl">Question:</span> Rav holds that they lack even Tum'as Atzman (mid'Oraisa). How can he explain why R. Eliezer is stringent about a Safek?</p>
<p class="bas subject"><span class="nm">2)</span>WHEN IS R. YEHUDAH LENIENT ABOUT A <i>SAFEK</i>?</p>
<p class="bas indent1"><span class="nm">(a)</span><span class="cl">Answer #2 (to contradiction 4a, 18b):</span> Mishnah #1 is like R. Yehudah (he is lenient about Safek Nezirus), and our Mishnah is like R. Shimon (he is stringent):</p>
<p class="bas indent2"><span class="nm">1.</span><span class="cl">(Beraisa #1 - R. Yehudah):</span> If one said 'I am a Nazir if this pile is at least 100 Kor (a volume)', and the pile was stolen or lost, he is permitted (he is not a Nazir);</p>
<p class="bas indent2"><span class="nm">2.</span>R. Shimon forbids.</p>
<p class="bas indent1"><span class="nm">(b)</span><span class="cl">Contradiction:</span> Elsewhere, R. Yehudah holds that a person forbids himself through Safek!</p>
<p class="bas indent2"><span class="nm">1.</span><span class="cl">(Mishnah - R. Yehudah):</span> In Yehudah, if he said Terumah Stam, he is forbidden. In Galil, he is permitted, for there people are not familiar with Terumas ha'Lishkah.</p>
<p class="bas indent2"><span class="nm">2.</span><span class="cl">Inference:</span> If they were familiar with it, he would be forbidden (even though we are unsure what he intended)!</p>
<p class="bas bbbline">19b----------------------------------------19b</p>
<p class="bas indent1"><span class="nm">(c)</span><span class="cl">Answer #1 (Rava):</span> In Beraisa #1, R. Yehudah holds that a person does not enter a Safek, for it is more stringent than Vadai (Nezirus).</p>
<p class="bas indent2"><span class="nm">1.</span>A Vadai Nazir can shave (at the end of Nezirus) and bring Korbanos, and the Korbanos are eaten. A Safek Nazir cannot do so!</p>
<p class="bas indent1"><span class="nm">(d)</span><span class="cl">Question (Rav Huna bar Yehudah):</span> If he said that he will be a Nazir Olam (for life), a Safek is not more stringent (in any case he can never shave)!</p>
<p class="bas indent1"><span class="nm">(e)</span><span class="cl">Answer (Rava):</span> A Vadai Nazir Olam is more lenient. If his hair gets too long, he may cut it and bring three Korbanos. A Safek Nazir Olam may not do so.</p>
<p class="bas indent1"><span class="nm">(f)</span><span class="cl">Question (Rav Huna):</span> If he said that he will be a Nazir (like) Shimshon (who may not cut his hair), a Safek is not more stringent!</p>
<p class="bas indent1"><span class="nm">(g)</span><span class="cl">Answer (Rava):</span> No Beraisa says that R. Yehudah is lenient about Nezirus Shimshon. Our Beraisa discusses Stam Nezirus, not discuss Nezirus Shimshon.</p>
<p class="bas indent1"><span class="nm">(h)</span><span class="cl">Question (Rav Huna):</span> R. Ada bar Ahavah said that a Beraisa explicitly says that R. Yehudah is lenient about Nezirus Shimshon!</p>
<p class="bas indent1"><span class="nm">(i)</span><span class="cl">Rava:</span> I cannot answer this. (Alternatively - they argue about R. Yehudah's opinion.)</p>
<p class="bas indent1"><span class="nm">(j)</span><span class="cl">Answer #2 (Rav Ashi):</span> In Beraisa #1, R. Yehudah cites R. Tarfon. He himself disagrees:</p>
<p class="bas indent2"><span class="nm">1.</span><span class="cl">(Beraisa - R. Yehudah citing R. Tarfon):</span> If David and Levi saw a man walking towards them, and David accepted Nezirus on condition that it is Ploni, and Levi accepted Nezirus on condition that it is not Ploni, neither of them is a Nazir, for Nezirus requires Hafla'ah (a definite acceptance).</p>
<p class="bas indent1"><span class="nm">(k)</span><span class="cl">Question:</span> If so, why did the Beraisa say that the pile was stolen or lost? In any case he is not a Nazir!</p>
<p class="bas indent1"><span class="nm">(l)</span><span class="cl">Answer:</span> The Beraisa discusses when it was stolen or lost to show the extremity of R. Shimon's opinion. Even in such a case, he holds that a person forbids himself due to Safek.</p>
<p class="bas subject"><span class="nm">3)</span>A DOUBT ABOUT WHAT ONE MEANT</p>
<p class="bas indent1"><span class="nm">(a)</span><span class="cl">(Mishnah - R. Yehudah):</span> In Yehudah, if he said Terumah Stam... (In Galil, he is permitted, for there people are not familiar with Terumas ha'Lishkah.)</p>
<p class="bas indent1"><span class="nm">(b)</span><span class="cl">Inference:</span> If they were familiar with it, he would be forbidden. This shows that he is stringent about a Safek (what he intended).</p>
<p class="bas indent1"><span class="nm">(c)</span><span class="cl">Contradiction (Seifa):</span> If he said Cherem Stam, in Yehudah he is permitted. In Galil he is forbidden, for people there are not familiar with Cherem of Kohanim.</p>
<p class="bas indent2"><span class="nm">1.</span><span class="cl">Inference:</span> If they were familiar with it, they would be permitted. This shows that he is lenient about a Safek!</p>
<p class="bas indent1"><span class="nm">(d)</span><span class="cl">Answer (Abaye):</span> R. Elazar b'Ribi Tzadok taught the Seifa:</p>
<p class="bas indent2"><span class="nm">1.</span><span class="cl">(Beraisa - R. Yehudah):</span> In Yehudah, if one said Terumah Stam, he is forbidden;</p>
<p class="bas indent2"><span class="nm">2.</span>R. Elazar b. R. Tzadok says, if one said Cherem Stam in Galil, he is forbidden.</p>
